<h3 id="c1">擴大助學運動的建議 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國家在目前需要大批新人材推行政策，國家在將來更需要大批新人材從事建設，而社會上工。商各界，更莫不迫切感覺眞正人材之缺乏。然而，一方面、却有大批靑年，爲了無力負擔學費，以致中途輟學，這是社會矛盾的現象。</p>
<p>爲了消除這種矛盾的現象，使有志靑年，都能入學，使國家社會所需要的人材，取用不竭，當然，最理想的是：第一，由政府普遍增設從小學至中學各級國民學校；第二，由政府在各省增設大學和專門學校，一律免費入學；第三，普遍發展職業敎育，在各縣市增設各種職業學校，以造成最需要的種種人材。但是，這些畢竟是理想，祇能期望於將來，自前事實，國庫貧乏，而支用浩繁，自不能完全責望於政府。因此，我們特別着眼於助學運動之努力，希望集合社會上的力量，儘可能幫助靑年得到繼續學業的機會。</p>
<p>助學運動是使失學者入學，爲國家社會培植人材，它既是一種社會運動，也是文化運動，關係於國家社會的前途，影響極大。所以，決不是社會上某一部份人或機關團體所能獨力推行完成的。因此，我們一向籲請各方面推行，而在今日，我們更希望政府出而領導或協助，使助學運動，能夠由上海一地，擴展到全國各地。也因此，我們除了竭誠呼籲社會各界對於助學運動，作更有力的協助與共起倡導之外，同時竭誠期待政府當局考慮下列三點；</p>
<p>第一，目前公立及國立學校，自小學中學以至專科大學，多數已實行免費制度。然而，從實際情形說，國立及公立學校，不僅只設在少數大都市，而且在數目上所能容納的學生，與全國適齡學童及靑年此起來，尙佔極少的比率。因此，不能不要求私立學校的輔助。但是，私立學校的經費來源有限，免費額固然有限之至，收費却不能不顧到開支而有日趨增加之勢，這樣，私立學校所能爲國家收納學生培養人材者，自極有限。廣大的靑少年仍不得不徘徊於學校門外。所以，我們以爲，如果政府的財源既不能大量普遍的增設各級學校，就必須（一）督導各私立學校，增加免費學額，多多收容淸寒學生，尤其是對於各種專門學校及大學更爲必需，同時，顧全私立學校的實際情形而給予適當的補助。（二）對於社會上遠見人士熱心助學運動出力或出錢特著成效的，特定褒揚嘉獎，造成一時風氣，俾社會各界，都能認淸「助學最善」，人人以捐款助學爲一種最高的名譽與責任。</p>
<p>第二，現在全國失學靑年的確數，雖無可靠的統計，然就日常可濡染所及的事實而論，其數目一定是很可驚人的，失學的原因，最主要的由於家境淸寒，無力擔負求學費用。我國古時，只要專心向學，只要借得數卷經籍，囊螢鑿壁，懸梁刺股，十年苦讀，就不難脫穎而出，拾取靑紫。然而眞正研究學問者，已有「白首窮經」，望史興嘆者，現在人事日繁，學問的界限已大爲擴展，若只靠校外自修而能爲國家社會大用者，雖非絕無其人，究竟只限於少數待殊的天才。一般的說，終非入學不可。可是，目前中等以下家庭，確已不勝負擔子女敎育費。因此，我們盼望政府當局確立淸貧子弟助學辦法，使家境淸寒子弟，都能獲得入學的機會。同時特別設立助學獎學辦法，使淸貧子弟而成績特優者，於獲得助學之外，更得獎勵，助學或以一學期爲限，成績差劣者可酌减其助學時期，而對於成績品行特優者的獎學，則可保障其完畢一定期間之學業，進而給以升學的機會。如此，更可收培植人材之效。</p>
<p>此外，我們必須提出的，是當前公務人員子弟的學業問題。公務人員，在我國部是知識份子，從敎育學與優生學的觀點來說，其子女也較爲優秀，然而，就目前公務員的實際生活而言，最低薪級者，每月連津貼收入僅一百五十元，對於負擔子女敎育費，一樣的困難。以致坐令優秀子女失學。我們希望政府確立公務人員子弟特別助學辦法，除完全免費就學於國立公立各級學校之外，對於在私立中學，專門學校及私立大學求學者，明白規定由官費助學辦法。我們相信，這樣，一方面可免公務人員在公務中爲子女敎育而分心，可以提高政治效率，另一方面使大量優秀子女都可安心向學，未來國家社會的收獲是不可限量的！</p>

<h3 id="c2">日大使谷正之返京　對華政策將有進展　根本改訂條約更進一步協力　平等互惠立塲處理各項問題 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日本新任駐華大使谷正之氏，日前返國，迭與政府當局對推進施策問題，舉行重要協議，意見業已完全一致，特於二十日返抵上海，於上海對堀內田尻兩公使作公務上之種種議，並與上海特別市長陳公博氏，國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏，高島華中振興公司總裁，商討要務多件，當於二十二日下午二時，偕同太田參事官淸水書記官等，由滬乘機返京。</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日本爲對我國緊密提携實施對華施策，特派谷正之爲新任駐華大使以來，我國人民對友邦此種善意措施，極表歡迎。日前谷大使曾返國　職，及　　　　華施策方針，公畢後已於二十二日下午返京，谷大使於此次返國途中，在上海會與陳市長及日大使館堀內田尻兩公使，國府最高經濟顧問石渡氏，華中振展公司總裁高島氏等，舉行懇談，結果頗爲圓滿。由此可見日本政府對於駐外使節之方針，已完全一致，同時對華政策之政治經濟兩方面，亦將有急速之具體進展。所謂對華施策之重要內容，已於日本第八十二屆臨時會議席上，由東條首相加以說明，即根木改訂中日條約，使兩國協力體制更進一步，由此可見谷大使此番返國之使命如何重大。預想今後中日兩國將本於平等互　立塲，作進一步之處理，其如撤廢在華治外法權中之課稅問題，調整國策公司，處理上海公共租界等問題，使國府實力更趨强化，故谷大使返京對處理今後對華施策等諸問題，其成效頗可期待。</p>

<p>南京廿二日中央社電　行政院昨舉行第一六七次會議，通過爲促進行政效率，改革處理公文辦法草案，按我國公文程式，手續冗繁，民國棨始以還，雖曾規定程式，然仍不合於現代文書之法則，因而仍留有淸明士大夫公文習氣較之一般學術，尤爲落伍，迄今未能利用打字謄寫複寫等較爲迅速之科學方法，公文所經　之程序，如發意，商討，擬稿，呈核，判行，繕寫，用印，封發，迨至發往收受機關，常至遷延時間，一方又因交通機關，未能發達，以致公文往還，更見遲緩，積弊所至，不僅减少事務效率，影響公務員精神，官署秘書，一如淸代師爺，事變前主席任行政院長時代，即曾提偶改革公文程式，圖增進行政效能，一時頗多改變，事變之後，遂又恢復舊習，形式之運用，尤爲重視，此次改革計劃，當局裨益行政效率不少，又當此戰時體制下，一切應以迅速節的爲原則，我國現有公文方式時間旣不迅速，用紙亦嫌浪費，改革實屬必要，且亦不容稍緩，近而爲商店符記，以及一切與公文之有關之事，均應以此類推，積習革新，政院通　此案，當裨益行政效率及公務員精神不少，各界人士頗希望當局澈底勵行，以符戰時體制。</p>

<p>東京二十二日中央社電　印度志士江特拉鮑斯，昨夜於此間廣播電台演講，大意稱：日軍於香港。菲島。東印度。馬來。新加坡。緬甸等地，俱曾牧獲光輝戰果，目前其雄師正制壓印度邊境，東亞方面此種實况，無論英。美方面如何宣傳，亦未可漠視。在英國支配印度史上，對於印度東部邊境將於何時遭受敵人之威脅，恐爲英國任何將領所未曾慮及者。以印度而言，目前最重要之事，乃印度環境之現狀」東條首相曾屢次代表日政府聲明，將英。美勢力逐出印度之決意，尤以最近東條首相所發表積極援助印度之聲明，實至爲重要。又英國主義對印政策對於印度亦具有直接重要關係　今仍未有若何改善，蓋英帝國之成長，實不　　開印度，英國之有今日，實爲侵奪印度之財富及資源所造成。以英國而言，彼等目前認爲印度將永爲大英帝國之領土，現英國戰爭之目的，即係企圖保守印度，故彼等認爲如承認仰度獨立，實無異喪失其帝國之榮譽，因而英國必將竭其全力，以企圖確保印度。故余可率直說明英政治家等之拒絕承認印度獨立，並非狂舉，而吾人如期待英人終有一日能自動放棄支配印度之思想，實爲眞正之在舉，英國在此次戰爭中，已喪失共一部份領土，因而英國爲企圖稍事塡補此項損失，其唯一希望即將於戰後更加儕榨取印度。總之，英國之地位因戰爭而愈趨惡劣，則今後必愈認有確保印度之必要，英國之帝國主義之政策，雖有破綻之處，但不能認爲彼將有所變更，且英國或未思及與印度成立妥協政策亦未可知，余所願於此鄭重指出者，即英國對印度採取妥協政第之意圖，決非將承認印度獨立，而係企圖，轉換印度民衆從事獨立鬥爭之方向，而其最終企圖，則在消滅印度國民之意志。諸君須知獨立者乃對於任何妥協俱不予以承認，吾人欲爭取眞正之自由，必須奮鬥，因此欲達成此目的，必須付出血的代價，故吾人應以堅固之快意及不動之信念，以繼續吾人之鬥爭直至從灰燼中建成獨立之印度而後止。</p>

<h3 id="c15">德正由軍政兩方面　謀對蘇用作戰新途徑　朝日新聞檢討現隊段戰局 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電二十二日爲德·蘇開戰二週年，此間朝日新聞昨載柏林專電，檢討現階段之德蘇戰爭，極爲透澈。茲誌其大意如次：六月已過半月，東綫德。蘇兩軍依然大軍相對，毫無開始大規模攻勢之意向，雙方僅互相宣傳「敵已迫近大攻勢」，此種宣傳或在相互等待對方開始攻擊，或亦另有企圖。此在德方，實已耗去五月初旬以來，即可發動其得意機動作戰之一個半月貴重時間，推論及此點，實不能不以異於去年歐洲戰局所起之微妙作用，作爲判斷材料。蓋以軍事而論，去年僅以東部戰綫爲一正面作戰，固可，今年則自突尼西亞撤退後，爲防止英。美軍於歐洲登陸，當不能不在歐洲建築「歐洲要塞」，故今已形成二正面作戰，因此德軍現調總力於東部戰綫之舉，是否有利，實不能斷言。於軍事情勢變化外，尙有一重要原因，即德國對蘇作戰方針，在政治方面，已漸有轉變，所謂轉變交付蘇聯之土地，資源，人力及精神力等，之綜合力量，亦即所謂「蘇聯之資源力」界限，德國已從新開始檢討，前此僅期以軍事謀解決之對蘇決戰，亦已轉換角度，而摻入濃厚之政治性，當茲德·蘇開戰二週年紀念日，此實爲一極堪性意之問題。德·蘇二年來之死鬥，今已到達一新階段，戰局進展至今日，德國對於以下數點實已有力加認識之必要，（一）即對於具有如此龐大戰力之蘇聯使用電擊戰實屬困難。（二）因共黨組織意外堅强，故德軍雖已獲得相當偉大之戰果，但仍不能期待蘇聯內部之政治崩潰。（三）佔領廣大地域及對蘇兵力武器之大量破壞，確已予蘇聯一當車大之打擊，但仍不能據此而斷定蘇聯之抗戰力已趨低下。（四）因蘇聯乃共產主義的獨裁組織，毫不顧及個人生命財產，故爲澈底進行悽慘之近代總力戰。蘇聯實具有此最適宜之國家組織。（五）因斯拉夫民族具有一般歐人性格不同，且此新蘇聯民族性格與俄羅斯固有愛國心結合之結果，遂又形成蘇軍兵士之一種特殊戰鬥精神，此精神實非一般歐人所能理解，由過去二年經騐所得之上述敎訓，而促成德國强烈反省者，乃屬當然。故今後德國對蘇作戰新方針，無論軍事，政治均由此反省而產生者亦屬當然。</p>
<h3 id="c16">德讚歎日本施策　已開始詳加研究 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>關於此事，國社黨機關報「國家報」曾六月四日發表一論文，題爲「轉換」，是文乃東綫從軍記者匿名所寫，彼曾明白指出，前此德國人之俄國現實已錯誤，並暗示德國之對蘇政策，已有轉變。德。蘇開戰以來，德報所表現之俄人觀，當時不爲表面觀察，而謂俄人爲野蠻之獸類人種，如此以冷靜神經批判蘇聯人之人的價値者，在德報尚屬初見，故此議論，頗堪注意。又德國爲澈底解決此反共產主義戰綫，現正由軍事，政治兩方面謀求對蘇作戰之新途徑，其尤具興味者，即德國對其從來注意之日本解決滿洲事變方法，處理中日事變方針以及此次對南方佔領地各種政策，近則非常決心開始研究，特別爲束條首相於此次臨時議會聲明於本年內予菲島以獨立榮譽後，德言論界之反嚮尤爲重大，「對於日本之佔領地統治方針」頗表讚嘆。且觀諸德國最近於東部佔領地所施之種種政策，如解消蘇聯式之强制勞動與集團農業，承認土地私有，準備授予投降之蘇聯俘虜以土地保障，蘇軍傷病兵士之生活，以德國幣重建破壞之都市鄉村計劃，解放前被蘇判決之罪犯等，無不爲德國對蘇新方策之表現。故如謂德國對蘇作戰方針第一年在於殲滅蘇軍野戰軍主力，第二年爲佔領蘇聯土地資源時，則第三年之特微，將在於以政治力解決此前途尙多困難之對蘇作戰也。</p>
<p>德蘇開戰已兩週年　蘇促闢第二戰綫</p>
<p>莫斯科二十二日中央社電　蘇聯情報局以二十二日爲德。蘇開戰二週年紀念日，特以「祖國戰爭二週年」爲題，發表長篇宣言，要求英。美立即在歐洲組成第二戰綫，茲錄其要旨如次：德·蘇開戰以來，迄已歷時二載。當一九四一年夏，蘇軍因戰備尙未完善，故不得不容德軍在戰事上得獲相當之成功，益以與蘇聯利害相共之反軸心各國，亦未能將蘇聯尙無生產之應付近代戰之大量武器充分援蘇。在此期間，蘇聯民衆與軍隊，實已備受試煉，努力防禦德軍之攻擊，以迄一九四一年末而阻止德軍之進擊。自一九四一年夏季至翌年春間，蘇軍乃得利用自然之條件，向德反攻，治至一九四二年夏，德軍父乘歐洲第二戰綫未能結成之隙，再度展開攻勢，終至被佔領多數之戰略要衝，但天佑時助，終得守住斯達科格勒。總計過去兩年問，蘇軍之損害連行踪不明者，合計共爲四百二十二萬人，大砲三萬五千尊，戰車三萬輛，飛機二萬三千架，惟蘇軍以獨力作戰，獲得勝利實至困難，故從速在歐洲結成第二戰綫，實爲獲得勝利之要決。第二戰綫不結成，實不能戰勝德軍，且將因無第二戰綫，而德軍即可留有大量兵力之餘裕，而再蹈去夏之覆轍。故第二戰綫之遲遲結成，實即爲予反軸心共同作戰以莫大之損害，且徒使戰事延長，而犧牲日增。</p>

<p>— 飯島正義</p>
<p>德國的企業觀</p>
<p>我們先來說明德國的企業態勢和日本的有何不同。納粹黨組織德意志第三帝國，在一九三四年發布所謂勞働憲章，在一九三七年施行新公司法。這許多法規所表顯者對於企業，和以前的觀念有非常的不同，企業不是所謂這求利潤的機關。企業也者，由一名指導者，及多數從業員組成，爲了驟家並民族的福利而勤勞的塲所。所以在企業中工作而生產物品，不一定是爲了構成企業的資本獲得利潤，乃是爲了國家並民族的利潤。企業本身獨佔利潤的事被否定了。除指導者的社長以下全體從業員，不徒爲實現利潤而勞勸，其目的乃在於增進德國國家並德國民族的福利，所以如有違反此目的的人，須受社會的制裁。這就是與以前的觀念不同而有特異性的地方。</p>
<p>受託委員會及勞働管理官</p>
<p>因有這種狀態。企業本身乃有可稱爲受託委員會的組織，視企業的大小，從從業員中選出代表者，使爲促進其企業本身的企業目的之諮詢機關。在改善勞働條件，增進生產能率等方策上，這些從從業員中所選出的委員們便成爲社長的輔佐，參與計劃。</p>
<p>這受託委員視需要而有權要求公布企業的利潤，不管其獲得了相當的利潤，如對從業員的福利設施無　舉辦，　可　求改正傾於社外分組的經營。</p>
<p>爲使適當地運用上述企業目的，當然總有監視機關的必要。因此，在各經濟地區，每區　所謂勞動管理官，對各企業發出忠吿且有權吿發自社長以至職工的全體從業員有不副企業目的的處所。因其告發不是所謂刑事上的過失，故不經刑事裁判，而經過在各經濟地區所　設的各　判所</p>
<p>名屬　判所爲二審制，初審在各經濟地區，上訴在柏林。在這　，勞働管理官以檢察的立塲告發。假令從業員中有過於怠惰者，即予告發而由名譽裁判所加以裁判。如其犯罪輕微，僅予以警告，或命其謹慎，如情節重大，則開除職位，社長級的首腦者則褫奪職權。會社的首腦部及從業員一經被褫奪職權後，即不能在德國國內再行就職。結果，喪失了生活的必需食糧，而受社會的制裁。但事實上受這種社會制裁的人迄今爲止，幾乎未見，這是名譽裁判所之無言的威力所致</p>
<p>在飛機工業方面，如何，籌措急劇地膨脹所需要的資金，則爲一大問題、僅賴民問資金，終究不能成立飛機工業，而不能不有賴於政府資金，這有二種方法：或由政府在十年，十五年間償付建設資金，或一開始即由政府　　全部資金。美國五萬架八萬架的大量生產計劃，僅民間亦不能負担這建設資金，故在政府五年間淸償的保證下，醵集民間資金。在德國，採用儘量延長淸償年限的方策，企業若無力償還時。政府負担其九〇％，企業僅負担其一〇％，設定所謂信用放款。現在德國某飛機公司的大部分資本，可說是政府資本，但事實並不是賴政府本身的支出而建設起來的，政府不過保證其償還而已。</p>
<p>其次，我們應認識飛機工業上美國式的企業形態和德國式的不同之所在。大部從事建設德國飛機工業的人，即係第一次大戰後渡美從事美國飛機工業的人，他們親身體騐了美國飛機工業的缺點。歸德後，苦心研究除去其缺點，而創設了現在的德國飛機工業。首先創設製造部分品的製造所，次有部分品構成的部門，苒决即有所謂飛機的總構組部門。美國式的企業形態，這三種都是飛機公司的負担部門。部分品的一部則由民間的小工塲，轉承包工塲製造。但這方式欲計算總的均衡非常困難，而飛機的需要亦有被民問知悉的危險。然則德國怎樣建設其飛機工業的呢？部分品製造及部分品構成這二者均使爲飛機工業的負担。這是二班交替的塲合，而總構組部門則一班交替即可完成。在一班交替的部分，因有作業的餘力，於是在戰時其工塲規模可擴大至二班交替制。軍需監督廳籌擬全部製造作塲的動員計劃，戰爭一開始，即實行二班交替制，企圖加倍其工作能力。具體地說、就是把平時的八小時一班工作制，自戰爭開始後即變爲十小時二班工作制。但因夜間工作不能提高工作能率，要達到平時二倍的生產力，頗爲困難。於是再徵用民需工塲，使如日本現在那樣的合作工塲。所以其結果工作能率達到平時生產量的　倍。</p>
<p>也僅是這樣，還缺乏修理部分，於是在製造部分品並部分品構成的工塲，給予某種比例的補助品生產部分。飛機，發動機每月能製造多少架，同時某種比例的修理用部分品亦使之有並行生產的能力。這在指導流動作業上是非常有利的。例如：每月製造飛機三十架，則所採的生產計劃，亦製造相當於三百個的部分品。如其製造了不適用的物品，則對別的工塲發出急需品的赤紙傳票，務使其能追及躭誤的工程，而使總構組的部門得以承利進行。</p>
<p>一製造所一種機械主義</p>
<p>因此，這些製造所的規模不必過份龐大。因爲在大量生產的見地上，以可能的减少每一製造所之製品的種類，爲原則。因此，在德國的飛機製造所，每一製造所製造一種機體，或一種發動機，即在不得已的塲合亦不超過二種。</p>
<p>從防衛國土的見地，把製造同一種機件的製造所分散於國內二個處所以上，是絕對的條件。在一個大規模的製造所製造幾種飛機的塲合，假使該製造所遭受轟炸而停止工作，顯然在作戰上將產生很大的障害。因此，所以必須在國內保有二個以上的製造同一種機件的製造所。現在的情形，同一種機件，有六七　製造所在同時製造，因而飛機製造所被轟炸的塲合，所受的損害，因分散的綠故，可以减輕。</p>
<p>由於以上的情形，故工塲的適當規模，應該是小範圍的。在軍隊方面，一個指揮官所能指揮的範圍，自有其限度，一個　　官不能指揮。幾萬名兵士。</p>
<p>從這觀點看來，在德國最爲合理的工塲規模應爲五六千人。職工數如在此以上，則一名社長就難於指揮。最初開始時，每一工塲的職工數不過三千人左右。汔去年，擁有五六千人從業員的製造所占浪多數。</p>
<p>此事就國土計劃而言是必須條件，在德國尤然。假定柏林像東京一樣熱閙而大規模，全人口的十分之一集中在柏林，那末，僅食糧問題恐怕就要發生不安了。因集中食糧的運輸機關，在戰時不僅不能自由，且因空襲的關係，陸上的運輸機關大部都得停頓。幾天一停頓下來，如何能供給大都市的衆多人口呢？因此，德國現正在考慮各都市靠其附近的生產物用以自紛，因而各製造所也跟着分散在能夠獲得其從業員的各市鎭附近。</p>
<p>隨着戰爭的進行，生產能率也漸漸地下降。從業員的獲得，已經到了窮途，資材的不足亦成問題，故不能增產。於是怎樣不增加人員，不增加設備，而仍可以增產，途成爲當前的急務、因此，唯一的方法祗有徹底地實施技術的交流。此在德國政府開始對蘇作戰時起，即已對國民極力要求，然而技術之公開交流的速度，其進展並未盡如政府的期望。</p>
<p>於是在去年二月繼陶德氏之後就任軍需大臣的斯倍耶氏，在五月實行軍需工業的國家管理。其內容，國家僅管理生產，至共經營管理仍由各企業自行計釗。因此，集合生產同一種軍需品製造所，組織爲一個生產集團。每生產集團由官方任命指導者一人。這從外表看來，生產指導者如社長一樣，全體同一軍需品的製造所集合爲其屬下，恰知組織成爲一家會社。</p>
<p>這種生產體系，不單實施於資材之消費部門的直接軍需品生產部門，且也實施於一切的資材供給部門，如製鐵及其他的金屬供給部門，動力供給部門，纖維部門等。</p>
<p>這生產指導者，雖說是官方任命的，但不是官吏或軍人，從這些製造業者中選出認爲最具國家意識，認識時局最淸楚而技術優秀者充任之。這生產指導者的俸給，由自已所必的會社支給，就其工作而言，係其自已所屬的社長屬下，所以根據依法律所與的權限，得自由調查其支配下的全體製造所，而使術得以公開交流，視其需要，把不良的製造所中的技術員或從業員移調至優良的製造所，實施訓練研究。或把優良的製造所中的熟練工或技術者，移調至不良的製造所，使其担任改善的責任。</p>
<p>與此同時，生產指導者對軍隊就需要數量並繳納期限申述意見。無理的需要，自然不能在規定的繳納期限如數繳納，於是自已規定，把承諾的所需要的數量，在一定的期前繳納。如此軍需工業的生產責任體制，於以確立</p>

<p>東條首相及重光外相在議會上的演說，曾闡明日本的對華政策，以一貫不渝之決心推進，並稱日本進備隨中日關係的進展，尙擬改訂現在條約。日本與中國確立善隣關係，築成大東亞共榮圈的中心，這是任何人所相信不疑的，眼前的事實，已經遂步證明了。</p>
<p>當此時會，中國官民都要了解日本的眞憲，相互飲助，共挽在瀾，然而，率直的說，中國方面對此的理解與誠意，似乎不够充分。例如環繞於商統會機構而存在的獨圖私利之閱向，現在如不趁早　淸，恐將遺禍於未來。商統會的組織，當然不是否定商人的正當利潤，反而給予商人一種正當利潤的保證。旨在採辦物資的圓滑化，促進健全的商業活動。同時，該會獄新的商業統制機桃之地位，在新中國的經濟建毅上，尙負有必須完成的重要責任，能無絲臺矛盾使此兩種傾向調和之時，商統會方能完全發揮其性能。</p>
<p>不是最近商統會的內部，不能理解其水身的重要任務，發生了促使商飲會成爲肆無忌憚追求私利的機關之危險傾向。我們相信這不過是限於一部份的現象，但據傳說：該會不允棉紗棉布搬往內地，事實上承認黑市希圖不法利潤。所傳果爲事實，那麼設價商統會之中日兩當局的善意用心，可謂完全遭受了蹂躪，似此情事，而且限碍了日本對華政策的推進，背反了日本的道義精神。</p>
<p>商統會理事長唐壽民氏，上次發表談話，力言商統會及下層機構，都須「公正廉明」，應該適應時局，各自發揮服務精神，尤其是戰爭時期，處理統制工作，須要常作一件社會服務工作來辦。我們所想說的在唐氏這短短數語中已經包括詳盡，並無讓我們再說的餘地。商統會的運用，在某種意味上，是判斷中國參戰與日本推進對華政策能吾成功的試金石。我們竭誠希望商統會當事人，自己覺悟其實仟的重大，抑制恣意追求私利的傾向，俾得發揚眞正健全的商業自治統制團體之機能。（雲鵬：譯自六月二十二日大陸新報評論）</p>

<p>— 若文</p>
<p>在六月六日申報上看見了自己的姓名，方知道應徽申報編輯生已經得到了初步審查的合格：又說是日下午就要舉行考試，急得我連忙吃了午餐，搭了電車，直往四馬路滬東公社而去。幸虧時候尙早，但到場者已有不少了。都是朝氣蓬勃的青年，後來對了號，入了座，二時一敲，就開始考試。第一試是作文，題目有二個，得任擇一　；一爲「我的學校生活」一爲「我的家庭生活」得題後，全場肅然無聲，埋頭作文。監場員目光銳利，甚爲嚴格，作文畢，即試常識。筆者因較早繳卷，故有暇將全部試題，照錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）中山先生對於民生主義最主要的主張是什麼？</p>
<p>（二）長江流域優於黃河流域者何在？</p>
<p>（三）世界羊毛出產最多者何處？橡膠出產最多者何處？</p>
<p>（四）四川何以稱爲富庶之區？</p>
<p>（五）報紙副刊與特刊主要區別在那裏？</p>
<p>（六）華北旱災那幾省最嚴重？上海賑濟華北的機關名稱叫什麼？</p>
<p>（七）　舉南京國民政府主席五院長及江蘇浙江安徽江西各省長姓名？</p>
<p>（八）新加坡位在何處及現在名稱？</p>
<p>（九）列舉軸心國與反軸心國主要國名。</p>
<p>（十）日本現任外相及駐華大使姓什麼？中國駐日大使是誰？</p>
<p>據說本來還要繼續舉行口試，但因時間已遲，故待筆試合格後再通知之。</p>
<p>此次申報聘請編輯生，使我深深地感動的是所開條件項下有這樣的規定；高中或以上，或同等學力者不須文憑，但自問學力不足者，不必嘗試……請託說情，作爲不合論。像這種腎明公正的考試，社會上各機關團體應該效仿；使不曾有實學而無文憑者望招考而興嘆，使一班無高親介紹職業的青年也有個自　的機會。</p>

<p>壯嚴的紫禁城</p>
<p>北京市街的美麗，在於紫禁城和城墻的宏偉。可是近來日漸衰　了。大部人寓城現已開放，故有機會得重遊一次。這確然是統治四百餘州的帝王的宮城。不知在何時有人說過，比較英國人對於倫敦的白金罕宮，有寄宿舍，療養院等　然大物之盛，可是紫禁城絕不會令人發生這種印象。</p>
<p>年年從南方歸國途中，自西貢經廣東飛向上海，俯敝華中華南的一角，見到了今昔　異的中　　　　　北方時，重又喚起了我的記　。</p>
<p>水鄉之戀</p>
<p>從北而面，時時在轉移中的色彩的變化，極爲　目。從北方的灰色與　色的　土，飛向綠野和水鄉的南方，在數小時之間，進入我們視野的造化之巧妙，給我們無數啓示。</p>
<p>在濟南降陸用中　。濟南是舊遊之地，城內因路遠而未能重遊一次。飛臨山東省的山岳地帶，飛行極高，在難挨的冷氣中，竟至於穿上了外套。在北京時完全是盛夏時期的氣候，因此有　多人都未預備。不久，泰山即在指　之間，山房重疊，氣象壯闊，幾如羽化而登天。</p>
<p>揚子江是女性的</p>
<p>從機上俯視揚子江，真有不可思議的感覺。若漠浩渺，無邊無際，真難捉摸。相傳孔子見老子，曰：「老子其猶龍乎！」這話可拿來形容揚子江。</p>
<p>李太白的「白　三千丈」一句詩可爲共代表。然而如　反　以下的一句，就無從置答了。我曾　幾次見過場子江，渡過揚子江。從飛機上看到的揚子江，任怎樣誇張也不能表現其萬一。去年，乘飛機過爪哇的火山地帶，曾驚嘆其雄偉，但如與場子江比較起來，從色的感受方面　，可說是女性的，不，揚子江超越了　種女性的或男性一切美。大禺在創造天地的時候所懷的愉快的感情可想而知。過山東俯瞰黃河，如與場子江比較起來，不過是一條溝渠。蘇門答　的芥林差可和它比擬。</p>
<p>騎青牛出函谷</p>
<p>我在上海雜記中曾說，即在中國，也有人說李太白是土耳其人，或是西比利並人。想起老子，或許要以爲老子也是移流民之一。他活着的時候頭髪是白的，在盡上面描着的他的相貌；和騎牛南下的姿勢，都不是中國人的樣子。孔子說他如　，恐是　語不十分通達的緣故吧？然而他的容貌有些像托爾斯太。思想的信仰上也有其通的地方。其淵源有三千年之古，這如其玩味起來，多少有些暗示不性。</p>
<p>我的上海雜記，爲上海有悠久歷史的申報　載，而與以多少反響。有許多地方連中國人自己也從未說起過。而所以被　載者也似有若干共感。我於此甚感愉快。（　：　自西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Suggestions for Expanding the Student Aid Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The nation currently needs a large number of new talents to implement policies, and in the future, it will need even more new talents to engage in construction. Moreover, all sectors of society, including industry and commerce, urgently feel the lack of true talent. However, on the one hand, a large number of young people are forced to drop out of school midway due to their inability to afford tuition fees. This is a phenomenon of social contradiction.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate this contradictory phenomenon, enable motivated young people to enroll in school, and ensure that the nation and society have an inexhaustible supply of needed talent, the most ideal approach is, of course: First, the government should universally increase the number of national schools at all levels, from elementary to secondary; Second, the government should increase the number of universities and specialized schools in each province, with free admission for all; Third, universally develop vocational education and increase the number of various vocational schools in each county and city to create the most needed types of talent. However, these are, after all, ideals that can only be hoped for in the future. In reality, the national treasury is depleted, and expenditures are enormous. It is impossible to fully rely on the government. Therefore, we are particularly focused on the efforts of the student aid movement, hoping to gather the strength of society to help young people obtain opportunities to continue their education as much as possible.</p>
<p>The student aid movement enables those who have dropped out of school to enroll, cultivating talent for the nation and society. It is both a social movement and a cultural movement, with a great impact on the future of the nation and society. Therefore, it is by no means something that a certain part of society or organizations can promote and complete independently. Therefore, we have always called on all parties to promote it. Today, we hope that the government will come forward to lead or assist, so that the student aid movement can expand from Shanghai to all parts of the country. Therefore, in addition to earnestly appealing to all sectors of society to provide more powerful assistance and co-advocacy for the student aid movement, we also earnestly expect the government authorities to consider the following three points:</p>
<p>First, most public and national schools, from elementary schools to secondary schools and even colleges and universities, have implemented a free education system. However, in reality, national and public schools are not only located in a few major cities, but also the number of students they can accommodate is a very small percentage compared to the number of school-age children and young people nationwide. Therefore, it is necessary to seek the assistance of private schools. However, private schools have limited sources of funding, the number of free places is extremely limited, and tuition fees inevitably tend to increase to cover expenses. In this way, the number of students that private schools can admit and cultivate for the nation is extremely limited. A large number of young people still have to wander outside the gates of schools. Therefore, we believe that if the government's financial resources cannot substantially and universally increase the number of schools at all levels, it must (1) supervise private schools to increase the number of free places and admit more poor students, especially for various specialized schools and universities, while also considering the actual situation of private schools and providing appropriate subsidies. (2) Specifically commend and reward those with foresight in society who are enthusiastic about the student aid movement and have made special achievements in contributing efforts or money, creating a temporary trend so that all sectors of society can recognize that "helping students is the best deed" and that everyone regards donating to help students as a supreme honor and responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, although there are no reliable statistics on the exact number of young people who have dropped out of school nationwide, judging from the facts that can be seen daily, the number must be very alarming. The main reason for dropping out of school is poverty and the inability to afford the cost of schooling. In ancient China, as long as one focused on learning, as long as one could borrow a few volumes of classics, studied by the light of fireflies and carved a hole in the wall, or pricked their thighs to stay awake while suspending themselves from beams, after ten years of hard study, it was not difficult to stand out and achieve high office. However, those who truly study knowledge already "spend their whole lives studying classics" and sigh when looking at history. Nowadays, affairs are becoming more complex, and the boundaries of knowledge have greatly expanded. Although there are still individuals who can be of great use to the nation and society through self-study outside of school, they are ultimately limited to a few outstanding geniuses. Generally speaking, one must still enroll in school. However, at present, families below the middle class are indeed unable to bear the cost of their children's education. Therefore, we hope that the government authorities will establish measures to help poor children study, so that children from poor families can have the opportunity to enroll in school. At the same time, special student aid and scholarship measures should be established, so that poor children with particularly excellent grades can receive awards in addition to receiving student aid. Student aid can be limited to one semester, and the period of student aid can be reduced for those with poor grades, while scholarships for those with particularly excellent grades and conduct can guarantee the completion of their studies for a certain period and even provide opportunities for further education. In this way, the effect of cultivating talent can be achieved.</p>
<p>In addition, we must raise the issue of the education of the children of current civil servants. Civil servants are intellectuals in our country. From the perspective of education and eugenics, their children are also more outstanding. However, in terms of the actual lives of current civil servants, those in the lowest salary grades earn only 150 yuan per month, including subsidies, which is just as difficult to afford the cost of their children's education. As a result, outstanding children are forced to drop out of school. We hope that the government will establish special student aid measures for the children of civil servants. In addition to completely free education in national and public schools at all levels, those who study in private secondary schools, specialized schools, and private universities should have clearly stipulated official funding for student aid. We believe that this will, on the one hand, prevent civil servants from being distracted by their children's education in their official duties, which can improve political efficiency, and on the other hand, allow a large number of outstanding children to study with peace of mind. The future gains for the nation and society are immeasurable!</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki Returns to Nanjing: Progress Expected in Policy Towards China, Fundamental Treaty Revision, Further Cooperation, Handling Various Issues on an Equal and Reciprocal Basis <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, recently returned to his country, repeatedly held important discussions with government authorities on promoting policy issues, and has reached a complete consensus of opinion. He arrived in Shanghai on the 20th and held various official discussions with Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri in Shanghai, as well as with Shanghai Special Mayor Chen Gongbo, National Government Supreme Economic Advisor Shotaro Ishiwata, and President of the North China Development Company, Takashima, on many important matters. He will take a flight from Shanghai to Nanjing at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, accompanied by Councilor Ota and Secretary Shimizu.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Since Japan dispatched Tani Masayuki as the new ambassador to China in order to closely cooperate in implementing policies towards China, the people of our country have expressed great welcome to this friendly measure. Ambassador Tani recently returned to his country for duty and policy direction towards China. After completing his official duties, he returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 22nd. During his return to the country, Ambassador Tani held cordial talks in Shanghai with Mayor Chen, Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy, National Government Supreme Economic Advisor Ishiwata, and President of the North China Development Company, Takashima, and the results were quite satisfactory. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese government's policy towards its overseas envoys is completely consistent, and there will be rapid and concrete progress in both the political and economic aspects of its policy towards China. The important content of the so-called policy towards China has been explained by Prime Minister Tojo at the 82nd extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, that is, fundamentally revising the Sino-Japanese Treaty to further advance the cooperative system between the two countries. From this, it can be seen how important Ambassador Tani's mission is on this return to his country. It is expected that China and Japan will handle further issues on an equal and reciprocal basis, such as abolishing taxation in the extraterritorial rights in China, adjusting national policy companies, and handling the Shanghai International Settlement, so as to further strengthen the strength of the National Government. Therefore, Ambassador Tani's return to Nanjing to handle issues such as future policies towards China is expected to be quite effective.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday Passed: Restoration of National Zhejiang University and Passed Draft Measures for Reforming the Handling of Official Documents <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 167th meeting on the 22nd and passed many important cases. The following is an excerpt: (1) The President submitted for discussion, according to the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee's signed presentation, in order to implement the Outline for Promoting Administrative Efficiency, stipulating the first phase of the work plan, a draft of measures for reforming the handling of official documents. It was resolved to pass the case and ordered by the Yuan to be promulgated and implemented separately. (2) The President submitted for discussion, according to the signed presentation of the Administrative Efficiency Promotion Committee for formulating the "Outline for Improving Central Administration" and the "Outline for Improving Local Administration," and asked for review, etc., and asked for a resolution. It was resolved that the Central Outline was passed, and the Local Outline was still submitted to the committee for supplementation. (3) The President submitted for discussion, regarding the case previously submitted by the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting the restoration of Zhejiang University, and successively instructed the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance to submit opinions. With the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Secretariat of the Yuan signed and presented opinions. It was resolved to pass the restoration of National Zhejiang University, and all preparatory matters were handed over to the Ministry of Education for handling. (4) The President submitted for discussion, the preparatory committee of the Third Congress of the East Asian Medical Association, headed by Chairman Chu, submitted the organization rules of the preparatory committee and the budget for preparatory expenses, congress expenses, and medical research expenses, and requested public review. It was resolved to pass the budget for review.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 167th meeting yesterday and passed a draft of measures to reform the handling of official documents in order to promote administrative efficiency. According to the format of official documents in our country, the procedures are cumbersome. Although the format was stipulated since the beginning of the Republic of China, it is still not in line with the modern rules of documentation. Therefore, it still retains the official habits of the Ming and Qing dynasties, which is more backward than general academics. To date, it has failed to use faster scientific methods such as typing, copying, and duplicating. The procedures through which official documents pass, such as initiation, discussion, drafting, submission for approval, judgment, writing, stamping, and sealing, often delay time until they are sent to and received by the receiving agency. On the one hand, the transportation agencies have failed to develop, which makes the exchange of official documents even slower. The accumulated abuses not only reduce work efficiency but also affect the spirit of civil servants. The secretaries of official offices are like the assistants in the Qing Dynasty. When Chairman Wang was the President of the Executive Yuan before the Incident, he once proposed reforming the format of official documents in an attempt to improve administrative efficiency, and many changes were made for a time. After the Incident, the old habits were restored, and the use of form was especially emphasized. This reform plan is expected to greatly benefit administrative efficiency. Moreover, under the current wartime system, everything should be based on speed and economy. The current method of official documents in our country is neither fast nor economical in terms of paper use, and reform is really necessary and cannot be delayed. Recently, things related to shop signs and all things related to official documents should be treated in the same way. To change the old habits, the passage of this case by the Executive Yuan is expected to greatly benefit administrative efficiency and the spirit of civil servants. People from all walks of life hope that the authorities will thoroughly implement it to conform to the wartime system.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Count Kuroda Discusses Issues of Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Count Kuroda Kiyoshi, a director of the Japan International Cultural Promotion Association, came to Nanjing again on the afternoon of the 17th for the sake of communicating with East Asia and revitalizing Chinese international culture. Count Kuroda had previously come to Nanjing to host the Exhibition of Modern Japanese Paintings. This time, he came to Nanjing specifically to visit various parties, connect and communicate on Sino-Japanese cultural matters, and presented two huge modern Japanese books to the Chairman. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, Count Kuroda went to the Chairman's residence to pay respects to the Chairman. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Count Kuroda to explore the future tasks of the International Cultural Promotion Association. Count Kuroda answered the questions raised as follows: (Question) How is the current stage of work for promoting international culture? (Answer) Promoting international culture is to promote the emotional integration between countries and to promote it to become world civilization. In 1939, the European War spread and the global cultural industry was at a standstill. Therefore, promoting international culture is a matter of urgency. The current stage of work often starts with China and Japan. The current stage of work is how to complete the cultural exchange between China and Japan, and during the Great East Asia War, the cultural exchange between China and Japan is extremely important. The Association will devote all its manpower and material resources to this important mission. In the future, it will often send staff to Nanjing to carry out various Sino-Japanese cultural exchange activities. Regarding the Sino-Japanese cultural exchange work, it is currently being promoted with the Japanese Ambassador to Nanjing and Councilor Ito, who is also the Minister of Culture, and hopes that all sectors of China will assist. (Question) How is the preliminary work for building the Greater East Asia culture? (Answer) Promoting international culture starts with building the Greater East Asia culture. The preliminary work for building the Greater East Asia culture is to complete the Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. The so-called Greater East Asia culture has two aspects: one is to strive to promote the culture of one's own country, and the other is to absorb the culture of other countries and integrate it into the Greater East Asia culture that adapts to the times. Both China and Japan have a long history. China can strive to promote its inherent culture of more than 3,000 years of history, while also studying the latest academic knowledge and promoting China's unique and brilliant culture. Japan should also strive to promote its culture of more than 3,600 years since its founding, and then join its friendly country China in advancing towards the construction of the Greater East Asia culture. Because the culture of China and Japan has had its glorious existence in history, with its long history helping each other, the completion of the Greater East Asia culture is not far away. (Question) What are your impressions of the state of Chinese culture during the war? (Answer) During the war, China is actively promoting the New National Movement, and the promotion of the New Movement is also closely related to Chinese culture. Its main goal is to revive China and defend East Asia, and to promote wartime culture, we must first start by training young people. In building the Greater East Asia culture today, we have great hope for the New National Movement. The close cooperation between modern young people in China and Japan is what we seek. Finally, Mr. Kuroda also explained that the East Asian Renaissance is based on moral spirit and is vastly different from European utilitarian thought.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Bose's Radio Speech in Japan: Resolved to Strive for Indian Independence <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Indian patriot Jiang Tela Bose gave a speech on the radio here last night, saying in essence: The Japanese army has achieved brilliant results in Hong Kong, the Philippines, East India, Malaya, Singapore, and Myanmar. At present, its mighty army is suppressing the Indian border. This reality in East Asia cannot be ignored no matter how the British and American sides promote it. In the history of British rule in India, the British any general has probably not considered when the eastern border of India will be threatened by the enemy. As far as India is concerned, the most important thing at present is the current state of India's environment." Prime Minister Tojo has repeatedly stated on behalf of the Japanese government his determination to drive British and American forces out of India, especially the recent statement by Prime Minister Tojo on actively assisting India is extremely important. Moreover, Britishism's policy towards India has a direct and important relationship with India, and there has still been no improvement, because the growth of the British Empire is inseparable from India, and Britain's existence today is caused by the invasion of India's wealth and resources. As far as Britain is concerned, they currently believe that India will forever be a territory of the British Empire, and the purpose of Britain's current war is to try to preserve India. Therefore, they believe that recognizing India's independence is tantamount to losing the glory of their empire, and therefore Britain will do everything in its power to try to ensure India. Therefore, I can frankly state that the refusal of British politicians to recognize India's independence is not a crazy move, and it is a true madness for us to expect the British to one day automatically abandon the idea of ruling India. Britain has lost a part of its territory in this war, and therefore Britain's only hope to try to fill this loss is to squeeze India even more after the war. In short, Britain's position is becoming more and more deteriorated due to the war, and in the future, it will be more necessary to ensure India. Although there are flaws in Britain's imperialist policy, it cannot be considered that it will change, and it is not known whether Britain has thought of establishing a compromise policy with India. What I want to solemnly point out here is that Britain's intention to adopt a compromise policy towards India is by no means to recognize India's independence, but to try to divert the direction of the Indian people's struggle for independence, and its ultimate attempt is to eliminate the will of the Indian people. You must know that those who are independent do not recognize any compromise. We must fight to win true freedom. Therefore, to achieve this goal, we must pay a bloody price. Therefore, we should continue our struggle with firm contentment and immovable belief until we build an independent India from the ashes.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Germany is Seeking New Ways to Fight the Soviets on Military and Political Fronts Asahi Shimbun Examines the Current Stage of the War <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) The 22nd marks the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war. The Asahi Shimbun published a Berlin dispatch yesterday, thoroughly examining the current stage of the German-Soviet war. The gist of it is as follows: Half of June has passed, and the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front still face each other with large forces, showing no intention of launching a large-scale offensive. Both sides are only mutually promoting "the enemy is approaching a major offensive." This kind of promotion may be to wait for the other side to start the attack, or it may be for other purposes. From the German side, it has actually consumed one and a half months of valuable time since the beginning of May, when it could have launched its favorite mobile warfare. Inferring from this point, it is impossible not to use the subtle effect different from last year's European war situation as a basis for judgment. Because militarily speaking, last year's Eastern Front was only one front of operation, which was OK. This year, after the retreat from Tunisia, in order to prevent the British and American forces from landing in Europe, it is necessary to build a "Fortress Europe" in Europe, so it has now formed a two-front operation. Therefore, it is impossible to say whether Germany's current move to concentrate its forces on the Eastern Front is beneficial. In addition to the changes in the military situation, there is also an important reason, that is, Germany's operational policy against the Soviet Union has gradually changed in the political aspect. The so-called change is the comprehensive strength of the land, resources, manpower and spiritual power, etc., delivered by the Soviet Union, that is, the so-called "resource power of the Soviet Union." Germany has begun to re-examine it. The decisive battle against the Soviet Union, which was previously aimed at solving it militarily, has also changed its angle and incorporated a strong political nature. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war, this is indeed a very thought-provoking issue. The two years of deadly struggle between Germany and the Soviet Union have now reached a new stage. As the war situation has progressed to this day, Germany must strengthen its understanding of the following points: (1) It is difficult to use blitzkrieg warfare against the Soviet Union, which has such a huge combat power. (2) Because the Communist Party organization is unexpectedly strong, although the German army has achieved considerable great results, it still cannot expect the political collapse within the Soviet Union. (3) The occupation of vast territories and the large-scale destruction of Soviet troops and weapons have indeed dealt a major blow to the Soviet Union, but it cannot be concluded that the Soviet Union's resistance has declined. (4) Because the Soviet Union is a communist dictatorship, it does not care about personal life and property at all, so it is thoroughly carrying out a tragic modern total war. The Soviet Union really has the most suitable national organization for this. (5) Because the Slavic nation has a different character from ordinary Europeans, and the result of the combination of this new Soviet national character and the inherent Russian patriotism has formed a special combat spirit of the Soviet soldiers. This spirit is not understandable by ordinary Europeans. It is natural that Germany has strongly reflected on the above lessons learned from the past two years. Therefore, Germany's new policy against the Soviet Union in the future, whether military or political, will naturally be generated by this reflection.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Germany Praises Japan's Policies and Has Begun to Study Them in Detail <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Regarding this matter, the National Socialist Party's organ newspaper, "National Newspaper," published an article on June 4th entitled "Transformation." This article was written anonymously by a reporter who served in the Eastern Front. He clearly pointed out that Germans' previous understanding of Russia was wrong, and hinted that Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union had changed. Since the start of the German-Soviet war, the German newspapers have shown a view of the Russians. At that time, they did not observe the surface, but said that the Russians were savage and beastly races. It is the first time to criticize the value of the Soviet people with such a calm nerve in the German newspaper, so this discussion is quite noteworthy. In addition, in order to thoroughly resolve this anti-communist front, Germany is now seeking new ways to fight the Soviet Union in both military and political aspects. What is particularly interesting is that Germany has always paid attention to Japan's method of resolving the Manchurian Incident, its policy on handling the Sino-Japanese Incident, and its various policies in the occupied territories in the South. Recently, it is determined to start researching them, especially after Prime Minister Tojo declared in the temporary Diet this year that the Philippines would be granted independent honor. The reaction in the German media was particularly significant, praising "Japan's policy of governing occupied territories." Moreover, looking at the various policies recently implemented by Germany in the eastern occupied territories, such as dissolving the Soviet-style forced labor and collective agriculture, recognizing private ownership of land, preparing to grant land guarantees to surrendered Soviet prisoners, providing for the lives of wounded and sick Soviet soldiers, planning to rebuild destroyed cities and villages with German currency, and releasing criminals previously convicted by the Soviets, all of which are manifestations of Germany's new policy towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, if we say that the first year of Germany's operational policy against the Soviet Union was to annihilate the main force of the Soviet field army, and the second year was to occupy Soviet land and resources, then the characteristic of the third year will be to solve this Soviet war, which still has many difficulties, with political power.</p>
<p>The German-Soviet War Has Been Going on for Two Years The Soviet Union Urges the Opening of a Second Front</p>
<p>Moscow, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) On the occasion of the second anniversary of the German-Soviet war on the 22nd, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a lengthy declaration entitled "The Second Anniversary of the Patriotic War," demanding that Britain and the United States immediately form a second front in Europe. The gist of it is as follows: It has been two years since the start of the German-Soviet war. In the summer of 1941, because the Soviet army's war preparations were not perfect, it had to allow the German army to achieve considerable success in the war. In addition, the anti-Axis countries that shared interests with the Soviet Union also failed to fully assist the Soviet Union with a large number of modern weapons that the Soviet Union did not yet produce. During this period, the Soviet people and the army have been tested and worked hard to defend against the German army's attacks until the end of 1941, when the German army's advance was stopped. From the summer of 1941 to the spring of the following year, the Soviet army was able to take advantage of natural conditions to counterattack Germany. By the summer of 1942, the German army took advantage of the failure to form a second front in Europe and launched another offensive, eventually occupying many strategic strongholds. However, with the help of Heaven, it was finally able to hold Stalingrad. In the past two years, the Soviet army's losses, including those who are missing, totaled 4,220,000 people, 35,000 cannons, 30,000 tanks, and 23,000 aircraft. However, it is difficult for the Soviet army to win the victory by fighting alone, so the formation of a second front in Europe as soon as possible is the key to winning the victory. If the second front is not formed, it will not be possible to defeat the German army, and because there is no second front, the German army will be able to leave a large number of troops with surplus, and repeat the mistakes of last summer. Therefore, the delay in the formation of the second front is a great damage to the common operation of the anti-Axis, and it only prolongs the war and increases the sacrifices.</p>

<p>— Iijima Masayoshi</p>
<p>The German Enterprise View</p>
<p>First, let's explain how the German enterprise situation differs from that of Japan. The Nazi Party organized the German Third Reich, and in 1934, it promulgated the so-called Labor Charter, and in 1937, it implemented the new Company Law. What these many regulations show about enterprises is very different from the previous concept. An enterprise is not a so-called profit-seeking organization. An enterprise is composed of a leader and many employees, and is a place to work hard for the welfare of the country and the nation. Therefore, working in an enterprise and producing goods is not necessarily for the purpose of making a profit for the capital of the enterprise, but for the profit of the country and the nation. The enterprise itself monopolizing profits is denied. All employees, except for the leader, the president, etc., do not work only to realize profits, but their purpose is to improve the welfare of the German country and the German nation. Therefore, if anyone violates this purpose, they must be subject to social sanctions. This is the unique point that differs from the previous concept.</p>
<p>Trusteeship Committee and Labor Management Officer</p>
<p>Because of this situation, the enterprise itself has an organization that can be called a Trusteeship Committee. Depending on the size of the enterprise, representatives are selected from the employees to serve as an advisory body to promote the enterprise's own enterprise purpose. These committee members, selected from the employees, become assistants to the president and participate in planning on measures such as improving labor conditions and increasing production efficiency.</p>
<p>This Trusteeship Committee has the right to demand the publication of the enterprise's profits as needed. Regardless of whether it has obtained considerable profits, if there are no welfare facilities for the employees, it can request correction and the operation of splitting into groups outside the company.</p>
<p>In order to properly use the above-mentioned enterprise purpose, of course, there is a need for a monitoring organization. Therefore, in each economic region, each region has a so-called Labor Management Officer who issues advice to each enterprise and has the right to accuse the entire employees from the president to the employees of places that do not conform to the enterprise purpose. Because the accusation is not a so-called criminal offense, it does not go through criminal trial, but goes through each court set up in each economic region.</p>
<p>The name belongs to the court and is a two-instance system. The first instance is in each economic region, and the appeal is in Berlin. Here, the Labor Management Officer accuses from the position of prosecutor. For example, if an employee is too lazy, they will be accused and tried by the Court of Honor. If the crime is minor, they will only be given a warning or ordered to be cautious. If the circumstances are serious, they will be dismissed from their position, and the leaders at the president level will be stripped of their powers. Once the headquarters and employees of the company are stripped of their powers, they cannot be employed again in Germany. As a result, they lose the necessary food for life and are subject to social sanctions. But in fact, people who have been subject to this kind of social sanctions have hardly been seen so far, which is due to the silent power of the Court of Honor.</p>
<p>How about in the aircraft industry? Raising the funds needed for the rapid expansion is a major problem. Relying solely on private capital will not be able to establish the aircraft industry after all, and will have to rely on government funds. There are two ways to do this: either the government pays off the construction funds in ten or fifteen years, or the government pays all the funds from the beginning. The US's plan to mass-produce 50,000 or 80,000 aircraft cannot be borne solely by the private sector, so private capital is raised under the guarantee that the government will pay it off in five years. In Germany, the policy of extending the repayment period as much as possible is adopted. If the enterprise is unable to repay, the government will bear 90% of it, and the enterprise will only bear 10% of it, setting up so-called credit lending. Now, most of the capital of a certain German aircraft company can be said to be government capital, but in fact, it is not built by relying on the government's own expenditures. The government is only guaranteeing its repayment.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should recognize the differences between the American-style and German-style enterprise forms in the aircraft industry. Most of the people engaged in building the German aircraft industry are those who went to the United States to engage in the American aircraft industry after World War I. They personally experienced the shortcomings of the American aircraft industry. After returning to Germany, they worked hard to study and remove its shortcomings, and created the current German aircraft industry. First, they created a manufacturing plant for manufacturing parts, then there was a department for assembling parts, and then there was the so-called aircraft general assembly department. In the American-style enterprise form, these three are all departments borne by the aircraft company. A part of the parts is manufactured by small private workshops and subcontracted workshops. But it is very difficult to calculate the overall balance with this method, and there is a risk that the needs of the aircraft will be known to the private sector. So how did Germany build its aircraft industry? Both parts manufacturing and parts assembly are borne by the aircraft industry. This is the case of two shifts, and the general assembly department can be completed in one shift. In the part of one shift, because there is surplus working capacity, the scale of its workshop can be expanded to a two-shift system in wartime. The Military Supply Supervision Office plans a mobilization plan for the entire manufacturing workshop, and as soon as the war starts, the two-shift system is implemented, attempting to double its work capacity. Specifically speaking, the eight-hour, one-shift work system in peacetime is changed to a ten-hour, two-shift work system after the start of the war. However, because working at night cannot improve work efficiency, it is quite difficult to achieve twice the productivity of peacetime. So civilian factories are requisitioned again, making them like the cooperative factories in Japan now. So as a result, the work efficiency reaches 1.7 times the production volume in peacetime.</p>
<p>Even with this, there is still a lack of a repair part. So in the workshops that manufacture parts and assemble parts, a certain proportion of auxiliary products are produced. How many aircraft and engines can be manufactured each month, and at the same time, a certain proportion of parts for repair are also made to have the ability to produce in parallel. This is very beneficial for guiding the flow operation. For example: if 30 aircraft are manufactured each month, the production plan adopted also manufactures parts equivalent to 300 aircraft. If it manufactures unsuitable items, it will issue an urgent red paper ticket to another workshop, so that it can catch up with the delayed project and allow the general assembly department to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>One Factory, One Machine Principle</p>
<p>Therefore, the scale of these manufacturing plants does not have to be too large. Because from the perspective of mass production, the principle is to reduce the types of products of each manufacturing plant as much as possible. Therefore, in German aircraft manufacturing plants, each manufacturing plant manufactures one type of airframe or one type of engine, and does not exceed two types even in unavoidable cases.</p>
<p>From the perspective of defending the territory, it is an absolute condition to disperse the manufacturing plants that manufacture the same type of machine parts in two or more places in the country. In the case where a large-scale manufacturing plant manufactures several types of aircraft, if the manufacturing plant is bombed and stops working, it will obviously cause great obstacles in combat. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain two or more manufacturing plants that manufacture the same type of machine parts in the country. In the current situation, the same type of machine parts is being manufactured by six or seven manufacturing plants at the same time, so the damage suffered when an aircraft manufacturing plant is bombed can be reduced due to the decentralization.</p>
<p>Due to the above situation, the appropriate scale of the workshop should be small. In the military, the scope that a commander can command has its limits, and a commander cannot command tens of thousands of soldiers.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the most reasonable workshop scale in Germany should be five or six thousand people. If the number of employees is above this, it will be difficult for one president to command. At the beginning, the number of employees in each workshop was only about 3,000. As of last year, manufacturing plants with 5,000 to 6,000 employees accounted for the majority.</p>
<p>This matter is a necessary condition in terms of national land planning, especially in Germany. Assuming that Berlin is as lively and large-scale as Tokyo, and one-tenth of the total population is concentrated in Berlin, then even the food problem may become uneasy. Because the transportation agencies for concentrating food cannot only be free in wartime, but also because of the air raids, most of the land transportation agencies have to stop. How can they supply the large population of the big cities if they stop for a few days? Therefore, Germany is now considering that each city relies on the products produced nearby to support itself, so each manufacturing plant is also dispersed near each city and town that can obtain its employees.</p>
<p>As the war progressed, production efficiency gradually declined. The acquisition of employees has reached the end, and the lack of materials has also become a problem, so production cannot be increased. Therefore, how to increase production without increasing personnel and equipment has become an urgent task at hand. Therefore, the only way is to thoroughly implement technical exchanges. This was strongly requested by the German government to the people from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, but the speed of open technical exchange did not progress as the government had hoped.</p>
<p>So last year in February, Speer, who took over as Minister of Munitions after Todt, implemented national management of the munitions industry in May. Its content is that the state only manages production, and the enterprises themselves plan and manage the joint operations. Therefore, manufacturing plants that produce the same type of military supplies are gathered and organized into a production group. Each production group is officially appointed with one leader. From the outside, the production leader is like the president, and all the manufacturing plants of the same military supplies are gathered under his command, just like organizing a company.</p>
<p>This production system is not only implemented in the direct military supplies production sector, which is the material consumption sector, but also in all material supply sectors, such as steelmaking and other metal supply sectors, power supply sectors, fiber sectors, etc.</p>
<p>This production leader, although he is officially appointed, is not a government official or a soldier. He is selected from the manufacturers who are considered to have the strongest national consciousness, the clearest understanding of the current situation, and the most excellent technology. The salary of this production leader is paid by the company to which he belongs. As far as his work is concerned, he is under the command of the president of his own company. Therefore, according to the authority granted by law, he can freely investigate all the manufacturing plants under his control, so that technology can be openly exchanged. If necessary, he can transfer technicians or employees from poor manufacturing plants to excellent manufacturing plants for training and research. Or he can transfer skilled workers or technicians from excellent manufacturing plants to poor manufacturing plants to take responsibility for improvement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the production leader expresses his opinions to the military on the required quantity and delivery deadline. Unreasonable needs will naturally not be delivered in the required quantity within the prescribed delivery deadline. So he defines it himself, and delivers the quantity of the required quantity promised before a certain period. In this way, the production responsibility system of the munitions industry is established.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Household Population and Grain Quantity and Price List Concerned With the Entire People's Livelihood Urgently Request Lowering of Price Limits and Increasing Allotments <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Second Special District Party Department, in view of the recent soaring prices, which have had a huge impact on people's livelihoods, yesterday submitted a request to its superiors, to be forwarded to the Central Government, to increase the city's food ration and suppress prices to stabilize people's livelihoods. The original text is excerpted as follows: It is found that food is of the utmost importance to the entire people's livelihood. Our government, concerned about the people's hardships, has repeatedly issued strict orders and admonitions to investigate and prohibit hoarding. Public sales have been held in various places, price limits have been widely implemented, and implementation has been earnestly carried out, achieving considerable results.</p>
<p>Prices Have Risen Sharply This Month Unexpectedly, since June, prices have soared, and the cost of living index has skyrocketed. Public officials, school teachers, and shop employees who rely on fixed salaries to make a living all feel unable to cope. Investigating the source of the price increases, unscrupulous merchants have all voiced the same opinion, claiming that the high price limits on rationed food and supplies (such as flour and cooking oil) are an excuse. In recent days, the price limit for household rationed rice in Shanghai has increased again, and the prices of various goods are bound to rise further. At this level of living, people will be unable to survive.</p>
<p>Increase Allotments and Lower Price Limits In order to protect people's livelihoods, this association proposes that the municipal authorities quickly reduce the price limits for household food rations and daily food products, and increase the allotment quantities. At the same time, reiterate the ban and impose effective and severe sanctions on unscrupulous merchants who hoard and exceed price limits. This matter has been recorded in the minutes of the 26th Executive Committee meeting of this association. We are submitting a document requesting your approval to forward it to the Central Government, explicitly ordering all provincial and municipal governments to suppress food price limits, and separately send letters to the municipal government and friendly authorities to quickly reduce the city's food price limits and increase allotment quantities to curb the price increase and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Various Industries Call for Full Allocation The various industry trade associations in the city, in order to adapt to the wartime system, have reorganized in accordance with the laws and regulations of the authorities, and have successively convened founding congresses, elected the first board of directors and supervisors, and are responsible for managing the association's affairs. It was learned yesterday that the recent handling of association affairs by various industry associations is very tense. However, the scope of their work is estimated to be the following points, and the steps taken are recorded as follows: (1) Appeal to the relevant authorities to fully allocate raw materials and finished products to the members of the same industry, and to approve the issuance of movement permits for the purpose of transporting them to the market or for processing and production. (2) Form a valuation committee to evaluate the prices of members' products and to review the quality of products. (3) Investigate whether the businesses of members of the same industry are legitimate and process the necessary documents. (4) Study how to improve members' products, how to produce them, and how to sell them. (5) Resolve various disputes between members and strongly urge them to conduct legitimate transactions and not to participate in black market transactions to avoid misunderstandings and unexpected entanglements. (6) Request the government or relevant parties to protect the legitimate rights and interests of members of the same industry. (7) Handle the registration of members of the same industry.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Grain Joint Operations Agency in the Shanghai area, there have been rumors that the per capita grain distribution in the two concessions and the urban area will be taken over by the agency. This rumor is actually untrue. Although the Central China Yu Gu Cooperative has transferred the right to supply household rice to the agency, the per capita grain distribution is still handled by the Baojia and military and political authorities in accordance with past practices. The focus of the agency's task is the procurement and transportation of rice and grain. The rice and grain in the producing areas are purchased by the agency and transported to Shanghai, and then distributed to the Public Works Bureau (Public Works Department) and the Municipal Food Bureau.</p>

<p>Regarding the recent promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Bailing Prisoners by the Ministry of Justice Administration, which was received by courts at all levels in the city, prisoners who exceed the budgeted quota or whose cells are insufficient may be bailed in accordance with these measures. The situation was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to inquiries, Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Prisoners stipulates that those who commit the following crimes shall not be bailed: (1) Those who commit crimes stipulated in Chapters 1 to 3 of Part 2 of the Criminal Law. (2) Public officials who commit the crime of dereliction of duty or embezzlement of public funds. (3) Those who commit the crime of theft, robbery, or banditry as a regular occupation. (4) Those who commit crimes with a minimum sentence of imprisonment of seven years or more. (5) Those who commit crimes against the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. Those who commit the crimes stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall not be allowed to be released on bail under any circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Cotton Products Supplied at Cost Adopting a Registered Allotment System Japanese Residents to Implement Next Month Allotment Quantity Calculated in Points <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese residents in the Shanghai area have a cotton product distribution system based on alliances. The planning committee has drafted measures that have been approved by the Japanese Consulate General and various related bureaus, and will be implemented from July 17. Active preparations are currently underway, and specific details are being negotiated by officials and civil groups. The distribution method follows a system of registered comprehensive points allocated to each person per year. The total consumption limit for each person per year is set at a certain number of points, and each type of item is also assigned a corresponding number of points. The total number of points for various items consumed by each person throughout the year must not exceed the limit. The distribution price is 30-40% cheaper than the market price. The distribution targets are divided into four categories: general, adult men (over 8 years old), adult women (over 8 years old), and young children (under 7 years old). For example, one person per year is allotted two towels and four pairs of socks. Women are allotted three pairs of cloth socks. Special allotments are also prepared for pregnant women. The annual allotment is worth about 5 million yuan. If calculated at the current market price, it would be around 8 million yuan. Therefore, merchants earn a difference of 3 million yuan. It is also understood that after the low-priced distribution of cotton products, the same measures will be taken for cosmetic soap and other daily necessities.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Public Concession Hotel Industry Preparing to Organize a Special Self-Defense Force <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Hotels Divided into Five Grades Based on Size The Public Concession Police Headquarters is actively promoting the organization of special self-defense forces within the concession to assist the police in maintaining law and order. It is stipulated that all public venues must be organized and established by a certain date. The hotel industry is complex, and the quality of travelers is uneven, so it is even more necessary to organize a special self-defense force. The authorities have instructed the industry association to be responsible for the organization, and the measures have also been stipulated, roughly as follows: (1) Hotels are divided into five grades based on size: A, B, C, D, and E. Grade A has 40 people, Grade B has 30 people, Grade C has 20 people, Grade D has 12 people, and Grade E has 4 to 6 people. (2) Each hotel is a unit, with one squad leader and two team leaders per hotel, and the number of members is determined by grade. (3) The manager serves as the squad leader, the receptionist or accountant serves as the team leader, and the tea boy or shop clerk serves as the member. (4) The special self-defense force serves three hours per shift, with two shifts rotating day and night. (5) Each member must prepare three photos, fill out a member roster (one for each hotel), assign a number, and report details such as age, place of origin, and position. (6) Each hotel must draw a flat drawing of the construction equipment, and the drawing paper must be the same size as the member roster for binding. It is also heard that the age of the members is limited to 20 to 45 years old, and only those with some knowledge are allowed. The hotel industry association is currently organizing it by a certain date. Once everything is in order, service will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Since the organization of special self-defense forces in the Baojia districts of the Public Concession, various public venues in the French Concession, such as Avenue Joffre, have long been ordered to organize "special auxiliary police." The armband on the right arm is different from that of ordinary auxiliary police. The armband of the special auxiliary police has the three letters "GSC" in Western characters, and below are the four Chinese characters "特別民警" (Special Auxiliary Police). However, this special auxiliary police is not directly under the command of the relevant Lianbao office.</p>

<p>In order to understand the current land situation in the Qingxiang area and to reorganize land administration, the Shanghai Qing Branch has launched a land survey, starting with the three districts of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao in the first phase of the Qingxiang area. Regarding the survey procedures and various regulations, the association has issued the following announcement: "In order to understand the current land situation in the Qingxiang area and to determine the actual acreage, so as to reorganize land administration, this association has launched a land survey. All land survey matters in the three districts of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao in the first phase of the Qingxiang area of this association shall be conducted from June 18 of this year to July 31 as the period for declaration and investigation. For all land in the above three districts, whether it is farmland, ponds, rivers, mountains, tombs, roads, bridges, residences, or other land for use, the owner or legal agent shall apply for survey and report in accordance with the regulations. Those who fail to report within the deadline or make false declarations will be deemed to have abandoned ownership of the unreported or underreported land, and the competent authority will handle it in accordance with the measures for managing public property. When handling the application procedures, a registration fee of one yuan per mu shall be paid, and any amount less than one mu shall be calculated as one mu. No other fees will be charged. It is hoped that the property owners in each district will go to the land survey office in each township to handle the application procedures within the prescribed time limit. This matter concerns the rights and interests of the property owners, so please do not wait and see and make mistakes. In addition, if any property owner conceals or makes false declarations, the public may report it secretly to this association or the land survey office in each district. Once verified, a bonus will be given. The regulations for handling land surveys by this association are hereby announced for everyone to know."</p>

The investigation work will be carried out by the offices for Chinese and Japanese residents respectively, from handling registration to inspecting public and private warehouses and private storage, all within the authority of the committee, and will be carried out thoroughly. The basic task of the Material Investigation Committee is to investigate hoarded materials and to deal with the hoarded goods and hoarders in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Commodities." Therefore, non-industry members or industry members who engage in illegal business, those who provide money for others to engage in improper business, resulting in manipulation of market prices and disruption of the market, and public officials who hoard or protect others who hoard, once discovered, will be subject to fines or imprisonment for minor offenses, and life imprisonment or the death penalty for serious offenses. All relevant bureaus participating in the Material Investigation Committee will cooperate.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) In view of the fact that tens of thousands of vendors enter and exit the Central Market every day during the ten markets, and the quality of these vendors is uneven, the market has issued registration certificates to ensure that the police are able to conduct random checks so as to prevent undesirable elements from entering the market. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the petition police of the market were conducting routine checks of registration certificates when Wu Wenkui, Xu Miaogen, and others from the local goods association, as well as no less than sixty or seventy vendors, assaulted Chen Guanxing, the 44th petition police officer of the market, injuring his head and internal organs. He was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital.</p>

In terms of the expenses of the Shanghai Leprosy Sanitarium, more than 30,000 yuan per month is needed. In this difficult situation, it is hoped that philanthropists will provide assistance. It is also heard that the association will continue to broadcast Peking Opera performances by famous actors and actresses at the Soviet Theater the day after tomorrow (the 24th) in the afternoon.</p>

The autopsy report from the Public Works Bureau and the forensic examination report have been submitted separately. According to the forensic examination, Su's death was determined to have been caused by a concussion to the ears and pancreas due to being beaten, resulting in cerebral congestion and bleeding.

<h3 id="e39">Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Selfish Interests <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in their speeches to the Diet, clarified Japan's policy toward China, promoting it with unwavering determination, and stated that Japan is prepared to revise the current treaty as Sino-Japanese relations develop. Establishing good neighborly relations between Japan and China and building the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is something that everyone believes without doubt, and the facts before our eyes have gradually proven this.</p>
<p>At this time, Chinese officials and the public must understand Japan's true intentions, help each other, and save the situation. However, frankly speaking, the understanding and sincerity of the Chinese side in this regard seem to be insufficient. For example, the tendency to seek selfish interests that surrounds the Commercial Control Council must be cleared up as soon as possible, otherwise it may cause future harm. The organization of the Commercial Control Council is certainly not to deny the legitimate profits of merchants, but rather to provide merchants with a guarantee of legitimate profits. Its aim is to streamline the procurement of materials and promote healthy commercial activities. At the same time, as the new commercial control mechanism, the council bears an important responsibility that must be fulfilled in the economic construction of the new China. The Commercial Control Council can only fully exert its performance when these two tendencies can be harmonized without any contradiction.</p>
<p>Recently, within the Commercial Control Council, there has been a dangerous tendency to misunderstand its own important tasks and to promote the Commercial Control Council to become an organization that unscrupulously pursues private interests. We believe that this is only limited to a part of the phenomenon, but it is said that the council does not allow cotton yarn and cotton cloth to be moved to the interior, and in fact recognizes the black market's attempts to gain illegal profits. If what is said is true, then the good intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities in setting up the Commercial Control Council can be said to have been completely trampled upon. This situation not only limits the promotion of Japan's policy toward China, but also goes against Japan's ethical spirit.</p>
<p>Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Council, stated in his last speech that the Commercial Control Council and its lower-level organizations must be "fair and honest" and should adapt to the current situation and each give full play to the spirit of service. In particular, during wartime, the work of handling control should always be treated as a social service. What we want to say is already included in Tang's short words, and there is no room for us to say more. The operation of the Commercial Control Council, in a sense, is a touchstone for judging whether China's participation in the war and Japan's promotion of its policy toward China can succeed. We sincerely hope that the parties involved in the Commercial Control Council will realize the importance of their work, suppress the tendency to arbitrarily pursue private interests, and be able to promote the function of a truly sound commercial self-government control organization.

<h3 id="e40">Rising Prices for Several Days The Problem Lies in Merchants Only Caring About Their Own Small Interests Talk by Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Council <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Exclusive Interview with This Newspaper) Recently, prices have suddenly risen again, and the trend of suppression is quite sharp. The general public has been feeling the heavy burden of life for many years, and it is really chilling to hear this. The government and authorities seem to be quite active in adjusting materials and prices, such as the recent establishment of the Material Investigation Committee and the evaluation by the Economic Bureau. The National Commercial Control Council, which was established more than three months ago to adjust materials, should theoretically have its effectiveness in direct proportion to the stability of prices. In the past, the council worked very hard, but at present, prices are rising day by day. In order to solve the doubts, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited Mr. Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Council, yesterday. Mr. Tang happened to be on sick leave, but he accepted the interview despite his illness and made a brief statement as follows: "The control of materials is currently handled by commercial self-governing organizations. Its success or failure directly affects the future of commercial self-government and is indirectly related to the entire economy. The general public should have a deep understanding of this and should recognize the environment and must not only seek the interests of the individual, but ignore the interests of the public. This view has already been repeatedly advocated in society. However, I have heard that the situation in the market recently is that prices are rising and becoming more severe. From some facts, it can be proved that this is definitely not a matter of supply and demand. The reasons for this can also be stated without going into detail. It is also rumored that some people are requesting to raise the price limit to more than 100 percent. I am currently ill and unable to investigate in detail, but I think that this kind of action is still nothing more than thinking about seeking the interests of the individual. However, this has created a situation of social unrest, which is not only a matter of conscience, but also a matter of imbalance in everything, which is likely to cause serious consequences. I sincerely hope that merchants with a long-term vision will recognize the position of self-government and use the power of the group to correct and curb this situation, so as not to cause themselves trouble." At this point, the reporter excused himself.</p>

<p>Regarding the transportation of various cotton textiles, such as socks, underwear, handkerchiefs, towels, bed sheets, and shirts, to other cities, it is necessary to obtain a visa and permission from the National Commercial Control Council. Since the establishment of the Cotton Textile Factory Industry Association of this city and the Joint Association of Cotton Products Industry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the procedures for applying for moving out cotton textiles have been formally stipulated. All cotton textile manufacturers who have materials to be moved to other cities can send them to the Cotton Textile Factory South Industry Association of this city and the Cotton Products Joint Association for official seal certification, and then send them to the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Council to request permission. However, the materials to be moved out are limited to actual needs. This permit is absolutely forbidden to be transferred. The situation has been good since it was handled, and manufacturers have found it convenient.</p>

<p>The Reorganization Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held its seventh meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry. Attendees included Director Yuan Yuquan, Committee Members Wang Zhigang, Sun Mingqi, Shen Tong, Yu (represented by Committee Member Zhang Jun), Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, Chen Zhong, and Zhang Jun, totaling nine individuals. The following important matters were discussed and resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau's submission of supplementary reasons for the artificial silk industry's request to independently organize an association, which was returned for reconsideration, a public decision was requested. (2) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Silk Thread Industry Trade Association's submission stating that the two initiators of the artificial silk industry, Yuan Jingbang and Ding Bingyao, had not attended the preparatory meeting due to their prior application to maintain the original organization, and requesting instructions on whether the artificial silk industry should participate in this trade association or form an independent association, a discussion was requested on how to handle this matter. (1) and (2) were discussed together, and it was resolved to approve the independent organization of the artificial silk trade association and to submit a request to the Ministry, through the Silk Industry Trade Association Joint Committee, for verification and instructions. (3) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Coarse and Fine Pigment Sundries Trade Association's resubmission of reasons for not merging with the Western Pigment Industry Association, which was returned for reconsideration, a public decision was requested. It was resolved that the Pigment Trade Association be allowed to split into the Pigment Trade and the Dye Trade two trade associations and to submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions. Additionally, it was requested that the Ministry order local competent authorities to adjust the already established Pigment Trade Association. (4) Regarding the Shanghai Dacheng Tire Firm Manager Shen Kun and others' request to organize the Shanghai Special City Rubber Tire and Transportation Materials Trade Association, a public decision was requested on whether to approve it. It was resolved to approve the independent organization of the Tire Trade Association and to join the Rubber Industry Trade Association Joint Committee. A request should be submitted to the Ministry for verification and instructions. (5) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Machinery Industry Federation's request to establish the Machinery Industry Trade Association Joint Committee and to separately establish (1) Machinery Factory Industry, (2) Machinery Commerce, (3) Foundry Industry, (4) Blacksmith Industry, (5) Hardware Factory Industry, (6) Screw Factory Industry, (7) Bicycle Factory Industry, (8) Knitting Machine Factory Industry, (9) Air Conditioning Factory Industry, (10) Electrical Industry, (11) Machinery Model Industry, and (12) Safe and Steel Utensil Industry, totaling twelve trade associations, a public decision was requested on whether to approve it. It was resolved that there was no need to organize them separately. (6) Regarding the Shanghai Special City Match Factory Trade Association's submission requesting to change its name to the Regional Match Factory Trade Association, verification and discussion were requested. It was resolved to change it to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Match Factory Trade Association and to submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions. (7) Omitted. (8) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's letter requesting that the Shanghai Special City Chemical Industry Raw Material Factory Industry and Chemical Industry Raw Material Trade two trade associations be placed under the jurisdiction of the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, verification and discussion were requested. It was resolved that (1) the trade association is an industrial and commercial organization, and its supervision and management includes matters such as distribution and sales, which is broader than the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau's scope of management of saltpeter and sulfur; (2) furthermore, the materials managed by these two associations are not limited to saltpeter and sulfur, and the management rights of other materials should not be transferred to the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau solely based on the relationship of saltpeter and sulfur management. Based on the above two points, these two associations should still follow the original procedures stipulated by the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau for the saltpeter and sulfur portion. The Economic Bureau's right to guide and supervise the association should be submitted to the Ministry for verification. (9) The task of reorganizing industrial and commercial trade associations assigned to this committee has been completed, and it is proposed to submit a request to the Ministry for approval to conclude the committee. A public decision was requested and it was resolved to approve and submit a request to the Ministry for verification and instructions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stimulated by various parties, and advanced across the board to new highs. The textile industry was the most vigorous, with Wing On Textiles breaking through major levels, and Yu Sheng rising significantly. Dasheng Mills No. 1 and No. 3 continued to rise, and Rong Feng was still leaping forward. The leap of Xinhuo Yarn Factory was even more intense. In the department store industry, Wing On, Sincere, and National Products Company all rose step by step. Underwear also saw a sudden rise, with King Lun Shirts and Socks selling well outside the customs. King Fook Shirts and Socks were firm. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. advanced rapidly. Great China Match and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco were firm and consistent. Guansheng Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison Electric stopped rising and tended to stabilize. The new medicine industry did not deviate from the steady trend. Zhongxing Timber was sought after by buyers. Baoan Glass traded at increasingly higher prices. Conyuan Manufacturing had demand exceeding supply.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: In the gray market, all five types of Unified Government Bonds, A, B, C, D, and E, rose.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Silver ornaments were sold at market stores based on the limited price per tael, but the procedures were more complicated than before. Transactions were sparse both within and outside the industry, and prices rose again. The official price of sycee silver remained unchanged, but the market price still exceeded the limited price.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The yarn market was prosperous due to demand exceeding supply, and prices were firm. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix, 32-count double-strand Fairy Peach, 20-count Green Single Horse, and 10-count Red Double Horse all saw increases, but transactions were not numerous. The cloth market opened this morning with a firm upward trend. Due to demand exceeding supply, prices rose steadily, reaching new highs.

<p>Banking and Money Industry: The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Trade Association, in accordance with the government-promulgated Provisional Regulations and Implementing Rules for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, has decided to implement reorganization to adapt to the wartime economic system. The original executive committee system will be changed to a system of directors and supervisors, with one director-general and several executive directors each. The association's articles of association have been revised in accordance with the new laws and regulations.

<p>Tea and Pastry Industry: Since its establishment, the Tea and Pastry Industry Trade Association has been actively handling association affairs. Its internal organization includes a secretariat, divided into general affairs, investigation, procurement, and allocation departments, each responsible for their respective duties, with a sound structure. On the one hand, it is handling the review of members and classifying them into different grades. On the other hand, it is contacting the establishment of special district branches in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Jiading. In order to comprehensively protect the rights and interests of the industry, it is deeply concerned that there are still a few members who have not completed the membership procedures, and has specially extended the deadline to the 26th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e47">The Editor Candidate Examination of Shen Bao <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Wen</p>
<p>I saw my name in the Shen Bao on June 6th and only then learned that I had passed the preliminary review for the Shen Bao editor candidate examination. It said that the examination would be held that afternoon, so I hurriedly ate lunch, took a tram, and went straight to the Shanghai East Public Association on Fourth Road. Fortunately, it was still early, but there were already many people there. They were all energetic young people. Later, we were assigned numbers, took our seats, and the examination began at two o'clock sharp. The first test was composition. There were two topics, and we had to choose one. One was "My School Life" and the other was "My Family Life". After receiving the topics, the entire room was silent, and everyone buried their heads in writing. The proctors were sharp-eyed and very strict. After the composition was completed, the general knowledge test was given. Because I handed in my paper earlier, I had time to copy down all the test questions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) What is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's most important proposition regarding the Principle of Livelihood?</p>
<p>(2) In what ways is the Yangtze River basin superior to the Yellow River basin?</p>
<p>(3) Where are the largest producers of wool in the world? Where are the largest producers of rubber?</p>
<p>(4) Why is Sichuan called a prosperous region?</p>
<p>(5) What are the main differences between newspaper supplements and special editions?</p>
<p>(6) Which provinces are the most severely affected by the North China drought? What is the name of the organization in Shanghai that is providing relief to North China?</p>
<p>(7) List the names of the Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, the heads of the five branches of government, and the governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>(8) Where is Singapore located and what is its current name?</p>
<p>(9) List the main countries of the Axis powers and the Anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>(10) What are the names of the current Japanese Foreign Minister and Ambassador to China? Who is the Chinese Ambassador to Japan?</p>
<p>It is said that an oral examination was originally planned, but because it was already late, we will be notified after the written test has been passed.</p>
<p>What deeply moved me about Shen Bao's recruitment of editor candidates this time was that the requirements included the following provision: high school or above, or those with equivalent academic ability, do not need diplomas, but those who question their own academic ability should not try... lobbying and pleading will not be considered. This kind of fair and just examination should be emulated by various institutions and organizations in society, so that those who do not have real knowledge but do not have diplomas will not sigh in despair at the recruitment, and so that a group of young people who do not have high-ranking relatives to introduce them to jobs will also have a chance to support themselves.</p>

<p>— Hashimoto Kanun</p>
<p>The Majestic Forbidden City</p>
<p>The beauty of Beijing's streets lies in the grandeur of the Forbidden City and the city walls. But recently it has been gradually declining. Most of the city has now been opened, so I have the opportunity to visit it again. It is indeed the palace city of emperors who ruled over more than four hundred states. I don't know when someone said that, compared to the British attitude towards Buckingham Palace in London, with dormitories, sanatoriums, etc., although the scale of the palace is grand, the Forbidden City will never give people this impression.</p>
<p>Every year on the way home from the south, flying from Saigon via Guangdong to Shanghai, overlooking a corner of Central and Southern China, I saw the changes between the past and the present. When I faced the north again, it rekindled my memories.</p>
<p>Love for the Water Towns</p>
<p>From the north, the changes in colors that are constantly shifting are extremely dazzling. Flying from the gray and yellow soil of the north to the green fields and water towns of the south, the ingenuity of nature that enters our field of vision within a few hours gives us countless inspirations.</p>
<p>I landed in Jinan for a short break. Jinan is a place I have visited before, but I was unable to revisit it this time due to the distance within the city. Flying over the mountainous area of Shandong Province, the flight was extremely high, and in the unbearable cold air, I even put on a coat. In Beijing, the climate was completely summer-like, so many people were unprepared. Soon, Mount Tai was between my fingers, with overlapping mountain houses and a magnificent atmosphere, almost like ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is Feminine</p>
<p>Looking down at the Yangtze River from the plane gives an incredible feeling. It is vast and boundless, truly difficult to grasp. It is said that Confucius, upon seeing Lao Tzu, said, "Lao Tzu is like a dragon!" This saying can be used to describe the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Li Bai's line "White hair three thousand feet" can represent it. However, if you ask what it is like beyond that, there is no way to answer. I have seen the Yangtze River several times and crossed the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River seen from the plane cannot be fully expressed no matter how exaggerated. Last year, flying over the volcanic area of ​​Java, I was amazed by its majesty, but compared with the Yangtze River, in terms of color perception, it can be said to be feminine, no, the Yangtze River transcends all kinds of feminine or masculine beauty. The joyful feelings that Da Yu had when he created the world can be imagined. Over Shandong, looking down at the Yellow River, compared with the Yangtze River, it is just a ditch. The jungles of Sumatra can be compared to it.</p>
<p>Riding a Green Ox Out of Hangu Pass</p>
<p>In my Shanghai Miscellany, I said that even in China, some people say that Li Bai was Turkish or Siberian. Thinking of Lao Tzu, perhaps we should think that Lao Tzu was also one of the displaced people. When he was alive, his hair was white, and his appearance depicted above, and the posture of riding a bull south, did not look Chinese. Confucius said he was like a dragon, perhaps because the language was not very clear? However, his appearance is somewhat like Tolstoy. There are also commonalities in the belief in thought. Its origins are three thousand years old, which, if pondered, has some suggestive possibilities.</p>
<p>My Shanghai Miscellany, published in the Shen Bao, which has a long history in Shanghai, has received some responses. There are many places that even the Chinese themselves have never talked about. And the reason for being published seems to have some common feelings. I am very happy about this.

<p>— Jian Feng</p>
<p>The cruelty of society,</p>
<p>The baseness of human feelings,</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of their ferocious faces.</p>
<p>Sighing, weeping…</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid of the thorns ahead,</p>
<p>Worrying and hesitating on the rugged path;</p>
<p>The future is bleak!</p>
<p>Wipe away the tears from your eyes,</p>
<p>Throw away the compassion in your heart,</p>
<p>Hold fast to your truth,</p>
<p>Sharpen your perseverance,</p>
<p>Struggle!</p>
<p>Go break through this evil consciousness,</p>
<p>So that they no longer survive,</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Destroy that hazy darkness, break through that dangerous atmosphere, open up your future, and strive for the coming of light! (Recompense)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Discussion on Curing Tuberculosis with White Ginkgo Soaked in Rapeseed Oil <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Jiǎng Yǐlán</p>
<p>My wife has suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis for nearly two years.  We have been through both Chinese and Western medical treatments, but there is no way to completely cure it.  Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Beiping saying: "The experiments in the Pingjin area on the treatment of tuberculosis with white ginkgo soaked in rapeseed oil are deeply appreciated.  The method is to soak 100 fresh virgin white ginkgo fruits with the cyan skin (i.e., the first fruits produced) in rapeseed oil. After 100 days, two fruits can be taken out each time, and eaten with the skin and kernel.  Take it two or three times a day.  Although the taste is bitter, the effect is very significant.  It is said that people who have been cured, after X-ray examination, are completely like healthy people.  Therefore, there are people in the Ping area who use this method for treatment," and so on.  I have not tried the treatment method mentioned above, because I have not heard anyone mention it in the southern area.  I think there is no shortage of people in Shanghai who study medicine and pharmacy, so I specially bring it up for discussion.  If it is indeed effective, it would be a savior for those suffering from tuberculosis.</p>
