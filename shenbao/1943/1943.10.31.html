<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日同盟與全面和平</h3>
<p>今年一月九日，國民政府對英美宣戰，旨在協力日本肅淸英美殘餘勢力，完遂大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。繼之，日本首先倡導交還租界，撤廢治外法權，而逐漸實施之。使中日關係，步入更進一層的密切階段。</p>
<p>同時，日本為實踐協助大東亞各民族的自由解放，先後促成緬甸，菲律賓的獨立，印度臨時政府的成立，馬來，爪哇軍政的解除，給與原住民參政機會，使大東亞各民族，進一步趨向於團結共榮之途。</p>
<p>一方面由於大東亞共榮圈形勢的進展與確立，一方面由於中日關係更深的緊密，從這兩個環境的孕育之下，對於以前的中日基本關係條約自然有修訂之必要。所以，這次簽訂的同盟倏約，在客觀環境是有其必然性的。</p>
<p>此次同盟條約與前此基本關係條約，意義上所不同的，前者因為目前中日協力大東亞戰爭，巳至休戚相共，脣齒相聯的地步；而後者不過企圖結束中日戰爭重趨和平，逐漸調整邦交。因此，基本關係條約上以及附件上，不無種種約束。現在同盟條約，不僅將種種約東一律廢除，即四十年前辛丑條約之駐兵權，亦同時放棄，這一種道義上的讓步，我們必須再度認識日本對於中國要求親善合作的誠意，除非執拗不化，頭固成見的人，都應該有一種更新的認識。</p>
<p>綜觀同盟條約的內容，目為正義與平等，實不為過。中國國民革命之目的，原為爭取自由平等。孫中山先生在其遺囑中昭示：「最近主張召開國民會議，及廢除不平等條約，尤須於最短期間，促其實現。」二十年來，國人昕夕以求的廢除不平等條約，未易實現，直至最近盟邦日本交還租界，撤廢治外法權以後，各國和繼響應實踐，從此束縛中國的不平等條約，悉予廢除，孫先生所諄諄囑咐的，雖未能於最短期間實現，但終於實現了。</p>
<p>我們以為在盟邦日本的立塲，修訂條約的目標，是以整個中國為對象，因此，在我們中國，也當以整個立塲去接受。履行條約，固然是雙方的義務，但是，我們知道同盟條約的目的，是在協力爭取大東亞戰爭勝利；而實現中日全面和平無疑為增强爭取勝利力量的保證，所以，如何實現中日全面和平，實為當務之急。然而，全面和平，決不是日本單獨所能促成的，我們一向主張，惟有和平區內政治上軌道，治安確立，民生安定，必須以此種事實爭取重慶統治下的人民，欣然來歸，這樣，重慶　權必將為失去民心的軀壳，決計無法有在的。反之，如果不以爭取民心為事，而欲與重慶政權用談判方式完成全面和平，可謂捨本逐末了。</p>
<h3>協力建設大東亞中日締同盟條約　恢復全面和平時日即撤兵</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　中日兩國於三十日，在南京簽訂同盟條約，兩國關係於此乃突入另一新階段。三年來之中日關係，以民國二十九年十一月所訂之基本條約而化敵為友。至民國三十年十二月，大東亞戰爭爆發，我國汪主席，聲明與友邦日本同甘共苦，協力大東亞戰爭。本年一月九日，我國復向英美宣戰，表明為復興中國，保衛東亞，決與日本同生共死。同時日本亦聲明援助中國完成自主獨立、且繼之交還租界，撤廢治外法權等，着着以援助中國自主獨立之施策，付諸實施。今日東亞情勢，既異於三年以前。中日關係，亦進至運命相共之域，於是昔日規定中日關係之基本條約等，即因時勢之推移，施行撤廢。而另行締結同盟條約，此實為歷史所必然之歸趨。此次中日間盟條約之成立，不僅中國可資以恢復主權，即對於整個大東亞建設，亦有其至大之貢獻也。茲錄外交宣傳兩部共同公報如左。</p>
<p>十月三十日上午十一時，外交部·宣傳部·共同公報：本日上午十時，國民政府行政院汪院長，與日本帝國特命全權大使谷正之。簽訂中華民國日本國間同盟條約，及附關議定書，並交換公文、於十時四于分完竣。茲錄全文如左：</p>
<h3>中華民國日本國間同盟條約</h3>
<p>大中華民國國民政府，及大日本帝圖政府，期望　國互為善鄰，尊重其自全獨立，並緊密協力，而建築以道義為某礎之大東亞，俾貢獻於世界全體之和平，並堅定決心，剷除對此有障害之一切福根，協定如左：第一條　中華民國及日本國，為永久維持兩國　等鄰友好之關係，應互相鄭重其主權及傾土·並於各方面講求互助教睦之方法。第二條中　華民國及日木國，為建設大東亞，並確保其安定起見，應互相堅密協力，儘量援助。第三條　中華民國及日本國，應以互惠為基調，實行兩團間緊密之經濟提携。第四條　為實施本條約所必要之細目，應由兩國該管官憲間，協議決定之。第五條　自本條約實施之日起，中華民國二十九年十一月三十日，即昭和十五年十一月三十日，簽訂之關於中華民國日本團間基本關係條約，速同其一切附屬文書，一併失效第六條　本條約自簽字之日起實施之。</p>
<p>下列簽字者各奉本國政府正當之委任，將本條約簽字蓋印，以昭信守。中華民國三十二年十月三十日　昭和十八年十月三十日　訂於南京，以中文及日文各繕本條約二份</p>
<p>大中華民國國民政府行政院院長汪兆銘。</p>
<p>大日本帝國待命全權大使谷正之。</p>
<h3>附屬議定書</h3>
<p>當本日簽訂中華民國日水岡間同盟條約時，兩國全權委員議定如左：第一條　日本國約定於兩國間恢復全而和平、載爭狀態　了時，徹去其派在中華民國領域內之日本國軍隊。</p>
<p>日本國根據北淸事變，北京議定條　，及其有關之文書所有之駐兵權·概予放棄。第二條　本議定書應與條約同時實施之。為此兩國全權委員，將本議定書簽字盡印，以昭信守。中華民國三十二年十月三十日　昭和十八年十月三十日　訂於南，京以中文及日文各繕本議定畫二份</p>
<p>大中華民國國民政府行政　院長汪兆銘。</p>
<p>大日本帝國特命全權大使谷正之。</p>
<h3>首都民衆慶祝大會　汪主席訓詞全文</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　本日上午十時，中日司盟條的締結。十一時，宣傳部正式公表後，汪主席親臨國民大會堂，對首都民衆及靑少年，慶祝中日同盟大會訓話，全文如左：</p>
<p>中日關係開新紀元</p>
<p>中日同盟條約，巳於今日簽字了，這是在中日關係開一新紀元，在東亞開一新紀元。中日兩國從此以後，完全站在平等互惠的立塲，結成永久友好關係，以共同致力於大東亞之建設。中國和日本，發生國家間和民族問的關係，已　二千多年了，在這二千多年當中，也有極小時間的衝突，算來不過幾年以至十幾年，還夠不上百分之一。其餘百分之九十九的時間，都是和好的。但是像這般完全根據於東方道義精神，　規定　國友好關係的條約，還是第一次。這是一掃百年以來。中國所受不平等條約束縛之痕跡，完全同復東亞同胞的本來面目。從此以後，中日友好閱係，一天一天的鞏固，大東亞共榮建設，一天一天的開展</p>
<p>基本關係條約失效</p>
<p>將這次聞盟條約，和民國二十九年十一月三十日所簽訂的基本　係條約比較，可以看出大大不同的地方。其中最大的有兩點：第一點，是基本關係條約第三條　二項的防共駐兵，第四條的治安駐兵，第五條的「基於歷來的慣例」之駐兵，完全撒消。還有此次附屬議定書第一條第二項，聲明放棄「北淸事變北京樣定條款，及其有關之文會，所有之駐兵欋」。因為這是關於駐兵權之特細規定　所以有此特別聲明。還有基本關係條約簽訂時附屬議定書第三條，規定「日本國軍隊，除根據本日所簽訂之關於中華民國日木國間基本關係條約，及兩國間之現行約定而駐屯者外，於兩國間恢復全面和平戰爭狀態終了時，開始撤乒。並應俟治安確立二年以內撤兵完畢。中華民國政府在本期間內，保障治安之確立。」此次附屬體定書第一條規定，「日本國約定於　國問恢復全面和平，戰爭狀態終了時，撤去其派在中華民國領城內之日本國軍隊」，將這次附帶的期間和條件，完全廢除（以下轉入第關版）</p>

<p>束京三十日中央社電日東條首相以中。甘同盟條約已於三十日簽訂，特發表談話，大　謂。。本日中臼兩國間締結向盟條約，硫立中日新關係之某礎，自中日兩國而言，誠堪慶賀同時大東亞之建設，因此又進一步，實具有重大意義。緣大東亞各國相百尊重自主獨立，緊密協力於大束亞建　·某於道義共存共榮秩序。以期貢獻全世界之和平者，乃帝團多年之夙願。而英美制國　亞之野心及，離問東亞各民族之陰謀，圖阻礙此理念之實現，帝國為粉碎英美此種野心，謀自存自衛起見，乃斷然崛討。邇來於大東亞各民族誠心協力下，以堅固決意，　進於完成戰目與大東亞之建設，中甘滿三國關係，因此甘趨緊密，甘泰之親善關係，亦為之增進，此外緬甸。菲律答亦相繼獨立，於是英美之舊秩序乃被遂出大東亞，復興大東亞之偉業。則着着向前推進。本年初中華民國對英美宜戰，聞明願與帝國同生共死，共同完成戰爭之決意，帝國於此乃期待本於中日提　之粗本精神·謀兩國之健全發展，希望中國之自主獨立，而發極政治力，從　建設新中國，並決意交深帝國在華一切專管租界，承認中國收間上海公共租界，厦門公共租界及北京公使館區域，實施敵廢治外法權，採取種種好意措置，以上均已完全是新。同時中華民國愈促進新中國之建設，愈得協力戰爭之成果，中日關係如此順利進展，以迄於今，本日乃於此寗行根本改訂中日基本條約，締結同盟條約，相信該同盟條約乃適應大東亞新事態，規定中日本來已有之關係大之戰爭目的與必勝之信念·始得締結該條約，帝國今後將基於該條約之根本精神，為促進新中國之建設，不惜予以一切支援·以期中臼兩國提携，邁進於完成大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>頭山滿談話</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電日本名士頭山滿翁，於此間私宅對中、日締給同盟條約事發表談話如次：中國國父孫中山先生，曾立志早日驅遂東亞諸地域之英國勢力，建設完整之東亞後，中國始能立足於世界，今當此東亞十億民衆聯合一致，協力邁進建設東亞共榮圈之秋，淪方實無反對之理由，任何人均有感情的誤解，故願渝方速為醒悟，謀立足世界之大計，今此大計即踏入正軌，故今後唯斷然實踐此目的而已。此次之中田同盟，即與孫中山先生前所言者相同，故今後中日兩國國民應誠心誠意，共同至擊減英美而後已。</p>
<h3>谷大使汪院長　先後致詞</h3>
<p>南京南三十甘中央社電日駐華大使谷正之氏，於中臼兩國簽訂同盟條約典禮中，致辭全全文：</p>
<p>本日於此，與閣下簽訂規定中日兩國間永久友好關係，及為大束亞建設，緊密協力，關係之中華民國日本國間同盟條約，及附屬議定書，並署名交換公文，實為本使所最欣快者。</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭開始以來，東亞情勢業已一變，中日兩國不僅早已不為第三國所乘，而作兄弟閱牆之爭，且互相協力，複歸於進至共存共榮途上應循之本來關係，此實為來亞歷史之一大轉機。帝國為適應此新情勢，貢獻於中華民國自主獨立之完整，促進其復興輿繁榮。乃決定以兩國立於同一立塲相携努力，以期達成建設大東亞之偉業為根本方針。自本年年初以來，卽着着努力其具體實現，此次之同盟條約，亦即為於最嚴肅之形式上，表現中日問之新關係者。因此前述之帝國根本方針，及帝國遂行此項方針之鞏固決意，深信亦可披瀝無遺。</p>
<p>因本同盟條約之簽訂，故於民國二十九年十一月三十目，所締結之中華民國與日本國間基本關係一條約，乃附屬書類，均已失共效力。今後中日兩國問之基本關係，幟依照本同盟條約之規定，是故本條約實可謂為實現大東亞新情勢，及中臼新關係而具有劃期之意義。本年一月九日之中日共同宣言，曾聞明於大束亞戰爭遂行中日兩國之協力關係，茲又締結永久而根本規定兩國關係之同盟條約，如此兩者相俟，今後兩國關係必能有歷史所未見之大展開。</p>
<p>此次之同盟條約及附屬書類，其所具有之重大意義，已如上述。今後中華民國全面和平恢復之時，可更進而發揮其光輝，固不待言。而今後中華民國國民，將舉其全力，復歸本然姿態，與帝國共同努力於與亞之大業者，本使尤深信不疑。而帝國之益因必勝態勢，以完遂大東亞戰爭之不斷努力，則中國共同之大事業，將以本條約之締結，而得有劃期的進展，實無可疑。本一使深望中華民國與帝國，能澈透本同盟條約之眞髓，以努力大東亞建設，及確保安定，而宣揚本同盟條約之世界史的意義，本日於此歷史的條約簽訂典禮中，謹略述所感，以為致辭。</p>

<h3>評言　職業介紹機關</h3>
<p>前論失業的將苦，　為增加生產是存　於人力與物力的同時集中、一面既然高呼國家之增產一面即不能坐視人民之失業，因此，職然介紀機關的有力文援與普　設立，實有必要，聲由此足以减除一部分失業的嚴重性，解決一部份全社曾之經濟問題。</p>
<p>本市　業介紹機關，前有中華職業教育社附設之上海職業指導所·靑年會之職業輸導部，以及寰球中國學生會之戰業介紹科等處均係私入團體辦理，頗著成續，憎限於經費等籌關係，先後停頓，殊為可惜；大東亞戰爭以來，市政當局、鑒於職業介紹事業之重要，乃由一區區公署社會福利局，積極肩起是項實任。以謀解決市民失業的痛苦，誠覺可以欣幸。</p>
<p>盟邦日本辦理職業介紹事業，素稱發達，且也著成績，可資取法，而世界其他各國，亦罔不注意推進；我國辦理較遲，社會謝此，尙少認識，以故發展之過程，殊為迂緩，今後亟宜注意宜導，務期普避明瞭，而對於工商界之聯絡、尤不可少·更須一改以往惟情是用之因襲制度，而能甄拔眞實之人才，使個入輿事業，購有裨益，以達事得其人，人得其所之目的。</p>
<p>在現今戰時體制下，既須集中全力來發展生產事業，對此人才問題實萬不可以忽視，而普遍的解決失業，公正的甄拔人才，實有賴於大規模設立公共職業介紹機關·希切各方盡力倡導，推進、，並且發揮這樣一個事業，以謀國家社會之福利。</p>

<h3>首都傾注大會　汪主席訓詞</h3>
<p>由第一版轉來</p>
<p>第二點是茶本關係條約第六條第二項，有華北及漿　字樣，第三項亦有同樣字樣，還有長江下游地域字樣，很容易使人感覺中國領域內有特殊地帶之存在，並且感覺到不止經濟方面，即政治軍事各方面，亦不免連帶而發生分裂統一之危險。現在同盟條約第三條，將這次特殊地帶的憂慮完全豁除。第一點是關係中國之自由，第二點是關於中國之統一，都是極重要的。此外還有極重要的，就是同盟條約第五條規定，「自本條約實施之日起，中華民國二十九年十一月三十日，即昭和十五年十一月三十日簽訂之關於中華民國日本國間基本關係條約，述同共一切附屬文書。一併失效。」從前很有些人疑慮基本關係條約之外，還有所謂密約，即無密約，而一切附屬文書中必有未經公佈的存在。如今，看見第五條規定，則所有疑慮可以雲消　散了。而且此次所簽訂的同盟條約，除了附屬議定書，及換文他一通之外，並沒有其各附屬文嘗，這更可見得光明磊落之至</p>
<p>獨立自主</p>
<p>益臻健全　還有要鄭重提出的，此次換文所說關於既成事實，比照基本關係條約附屬議定書各條意義更為明顯而詳盡。附屬議定書第一條，有所謂特殊事態之存在，第三條又有所謂旣成政權所辦事項之繼續。這兩種既成事實，三年以來，日本政府經隨時與國民政府，開誠布公，於可能範圍，加以調整，自從新政策施行以來，為援助中國完成自立獨立起見，更加勇決的進行，許多巳經調整的事實，已為世人所共見。此次換文，更充分的表示這種決心，固然要等待全面和平，恢復，戰爭狀態終了時，纔能全部調整，然而即在戰爭狀態繼續中，巳經可以按情形所許，隨時由兩國協議，如以調整。這完全為的是根據此次同盟條約的旨趣，使國民政府益臻强化化，中國獨立自主益臻健全，遭種厚意，實在令人感曁。</p>
<p>還有要附帶聲明的，同盟條約第四條，「為實施本條約所必要之細目，應由兩國該管官憲間，協議決定之」。按照國內法關於對外交涉，由中央政府主持，地方官吏遇到對外交涉，必須得到中央政府許可，秉承意旨，纔能辦理。還有些特定事項，中央政府也必須經過中央政治委員食及立法院的立法程序，這些都是國內法的規定，當然的事理，用不着解釋。我因顧慮到有入誤會，所以附帶聲明。</p>
<p>奠定永久友好基石</p>
<p>在簽訂基本關係條約當時，我對於國人的憂慮，曾經加以剴切的譬解。我說條約中的規定，多具有彈性，看我們努力如何。我們努力，可以使之向好的卞面，不然，就只有更一向於壞的方面。如駐兵時問長短，駐兵增點多少，　數多少，部　沒有織定，如果我們勢力能使全　和平恢使復國，防使完治兵至眸間必然短，駐兵地點及兵數必然少　反之，口有更長　更多駐兵　　我此們經努濟力現　經亦濟然的，方如針正確，經濟的人才衆多。辭濟的技術進步，理麼化經，濟能提利夠互　之目的。否則，只有敗壞下去。我相信這種　解，不是沒有理由的。我們既然簽訂了條約，就有遵守之義務，除以上所說之外，更沒有共他改善的希望。然而此次根本修正條約的洪意，是由日本政府提出，乃至此次同盟條約及附屬議定書換文的底稿，也是由日本政府提出。將上次　約時日本卞面所得到的特權，加以拋棄，毫沒有一點保留。同時對於中國方面所憂慮的各點，徹底的予以掃除。</p>
<p>我今日公開的告訴全國同胞。這次的修正條約，完全出於日本政府及國民的好意。為中日兩國永久友好起見，為大束亞共榮紀見，本於道　的精神，同胞的情感，提出這樣光明正大的主張，給予中國以起死回生的援助力量。為中日兩國奠下了永久友好的基石，為束亞開闢了合於正義之和平的大路。</p>
<p>一貫理念完全實現</p>
<p>我如今更有幾句話，為同胞告：日本何以有此次的決心與實行呢？論起「善鄰友好」的觀念、在近衛聲明中已經顯著。然而當時大東亞戰爭還未發生，英美的侵略勢力還存在於中國以內，散布於政治軍事經濟交化各方面，　一般的操　者即以駐兵為例，鴉片戰爭後的南京條約。巳經有了起點，及至庚子事變後而日益加重，那麽日本即欲廢素所謂歷來慣例而單獨行動，不惟　救於中國之束　與　檔，反而有增加了英美的恣橫之危險。駐兵間題如此，其他經濟問題亦莫不如此。</p>
<p>基本關係條約簽訂當時，日本顧處到這一層，不能不有所安排。及至大東亞戰爭發生，英美在中國的勢力巳經粉碎無餘了，這一層的廠慮巳不必要，因而許多安排也就不必要了。從今年一月九日，提前簽訂交還種界，撤廢治外法權的協定，以至最近的根本的修正條約，其理念是一貫的。全國同胞，現在我們該怎樣呢？在中國事變爆發的當初，大多數同胞認定抗戰亦亡，不抗戰亦亡、抱善這悲觀心理、從事抗戰。在和平運動開始的常初，還有些同施，認定中日提携是無望的，抱着這悲觀心理，拒絕和平。幾年以來，雖有種種事實，可以證明和平不是無望，卻是也有種種相反的事實，運延了決心與行動。如今呢，國父所提倡的大亞洲主義，巳由理論而進於實行了。國父所希望的日本權助中國廢除不平等條約，巳見之於事實了。國父遺囑，所期於後死同志，繼續努力廢除不平等條約，已經貫澈了。我們今日惟有根據中日同盟條約，將大束亞戰爭以來，同甘共苦同生共死的精神，凝結到金石一般堅囚。把國民總力集中起來，直至大東亞戰爭完遂，大東亞共榮建設告成，使中國的獨立自由，得到鞏固的保障。</p>
<p>永久結成友好關係</p>
<p>迥憶中日事變爆發以來，重慶方面曾經公開的說，「必須回復到　溝橋事變以前的狀態，才能實現和平。」以今日的狀態而論，不僅回復到　　橋事變以前的狀態，並且超過了若干倍了。　　橋事變以前，中國有租界存在，如今已交還。　　橋事變以前，中國有外溝國機人事的變　外前法，權中存國在，如今巳撤廢。蘆溝以內處處都是次殖民地轉檯，如今則英美侵略狀態，如今則英美侵略來勢　　　的淸不，平百等年條以約，巳經廢棄。蘆溝橋事變以前，中日方針背馳，關係　隍，如今則方針一致，永久友好關係，巳經結成。現在所需要的，只是重慶方面拋下抗戰，回復和平，這於東亞大局有利，於中國本身尤為有利。因為這據一來，日本履行撤兵，中國領域以內戰爭狀態，便立時終了。和平善後各種建設，便立時開始。</p>
<p>中國在大東惡戰爭中，處在後方地位，固然中瞬不忘記，要把精釵軍隊送上前綫，稍分友邦將士的勞苦。可是確立治安，增加生產，便是後方常務之急。中國這樣以來，不但盡了大東亞戰爭的後方義務，並且刺激戰後各種事　之復員與改進，這於中國元氣之恢復，國力民力之增益，是極有利的。重慶方面若不於此時拋下抗戰，回復和平，則重慶所謂抗戰，不是爲中國而抗議，乃是為英美而抗戰。不但要將本國領土供給英美，作為空軍根據地，使之轟炸自己同胞。本來可以安居復業的地方，一定要使之變做英美的屬定以要安使居　變業　英地美方的，屠一宰塲，同時還要將大批軍隊向緬甸方面輪送，做英美的鷹犬，以反　。東亞繼有了獨立萌芽的國家，這樣做法，不但是東亞的叛逆，並且是中國的罪人。盼望重慶方面的將士及民衆，認識清楚，趕快怏定自巳應走的路。這時候尙來得及，遲延一日，便躭課一日。</p>
<p>我想起我帶領着少數同志，赤手空拳，從重慶出來，為和平運動而奔走，到了今日，將五年了。無德無能，竟能得到日本這樣援助，俾中國完成其獨立自由之志願。我謹以至誠，謝是意日，本同政時府我及想國起民致重共慶方面舊日同伴，到現在還未過來，我實在抱着無限痛心，我謹以至誠，深深禱祝國父在天之靈，默　我們促成統一。我們發誓以勇猛精進，刻苦耐勞的精神，再接再厲，完成復興中華，保衛東亞之使命（完）</p>
<h3>國民論壇　無理由的　短少糖米麺粉票</h3>
<p>— 平明</p>
<p>滬西（越界築路）戶口米的數量和期限與一八區不同—數量少而期限不定，去年冬馴至六星期發一次。以前有租界的關係，今和界收囘後，而滬西戶口米的數量仍較一八區少；一八兩區至少一升，滬西糙米與碎米九合巳拿了三次；一八兩區的　給機關為經濟處，溫西為條食管理局—誰如此不良的現象日趨惡劣。</p>
<p>上月初，糧食管理局派員至滬西第一幼第九聯保調查戶口·某日敝甲甲長至舍問謂：「每戶須派一代表携戶籍證及全家的居住證，至保長處查騐」，滬西當局規定：「居民的年齡在六十歲以上及十歲以下無需領居住證」，會間大小共二十三人、十歲以下的有六名，幸都在家，所以携居住證十七張及戶籍證報到。查騐時該職員編默無言。</p>
<p>上月二十日左右，匯西保甲　員會亦來調查戶口·該會調查員之一語余：「因糧食管理局要劃去三人的口糧。特來覆查被劃去的一戶人數及全家有多少居住證，俾便交涉」·該日下午，甲長發來第二十二·二十三·二十四期米票，果然　少三張，第六期糖票亦少三張，詢之該甲長？他說：「根食管理局發來就少」。次日發來第十六，十七、十八期麵粉票亦都少三張；左右鄰居扣去一張或二張的都有，未扣去的亦有。</p>
<p>第六期戶口糖，一八兩區上月九日起出售，滬西居民如大早之望雪電、想至十四日（中秋節），總可發糖票、待至二十日左右，糖票被扣　始發一令人難解？</p>
<p>糧食局根據什麼理由？短少居民的糖，米·麵粉票；如是虛報戶口，何故該調查員查騐時默默無言？為什麼發來第六期的油票人數不短少？如糖·米·麵粉不　分配·何故不在報上宣佈？為什一麽甲聯保短少？乙聯保不短少？請當局調查一當局如有決心「澄淸吏治」·「爾淸貪汚」，「勵行廉潔」·非嚴厲澈查不可、此為我滬西居民之所期望也。</p>

        <h1>1943.10.31</h1>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Alliance and Overall Peace</h3>
<p>On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, aiming to cooperate with Japan in eliminating the remaining forces of Britain and the United States and achieving the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Following this, Japan took the lead in advocating the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and gradually implemented them. This has brought Sino-Japanese relations into an even closer stage.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to fulfill its commitment to assisting the freedom and liberation of various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, Japan successively promoted the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, and the removal of military administration in Malaya and Java, granting political participation opportunities to the indigenous people, thereby moving various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia further towards unity and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, due to the progress and establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and on the other hand, due to the deeper closeness of Sino-Japanese relations, from the nurturing of these two environments, it was naturally necessary to revise the previous Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty. Therefore, the signing of this time's Alliance Treaty is inevitably a result of objective circumstances.</p>
<p>The difference in significance between this Alliance Treaty and the previous Basic Relations Treaty lies in the fact that the former is due to the current Sino-Japanese cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, which has reached a point of sharing weal and woe and being as close as lips and teeth; while the latter only attempted to end the Sino-Japanese War, return to peace, and gradually adjust diplomatic relations. Therefore, there were various constraints in the Basic Relations Treaty and its annexes. Now, the Alliance Treaty not only abolishes all kinds of constraints but also abandons the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol of forty years ago. This kind of moral concession requires us to once again recognize Japan's sincerity in seeking amity and cooperation with China. Unless one is stubborn and unyielding, those with preconceived notions should have a renewed understanding.</p>
<p>Looking at the content of the Alliance Treaty as a whole, it is no exaggeration to say that it aims for justice and equality. The original aim of the Chinese National Revolution was to strive for freedom and equality. Dr. Sun Yat-sen stated in his will: "Recently, the advocacy of convening a national conference and abolishing unequal treaties must be realized in the shortest possible time." For twenty years, the Chinese people have been seeking the abolition of unequal treaties day and night, but it was not easy to achieve. It was not until recently when our allied nation Japan returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, that various countries echoed and implemented them. From then on, the unequal treaties that bound China were all abolished. Dr. Sun's earnest exhortations, although not realized in the shortest possible time, have finally been realized.</p>
<p>We believe that from the perspective of our ally, Japan, the goal of revising the treaty is to address the whole of China, therefore, we in China should also accept it from a holistic perspective. Fulfilling the treaty is of course the obligation of both parties, but we know that the purpose of the Alliance Treaty is to cooperate in winning the Greater East Asia War; and realizing comprehensive peace between China and Japan is undoubtedly a guarantee of strengthening the power to win the victory, therefore, how to achieve comprehensive peace between China and Japan is an urgent task. However, comprehensive peace can definitely not be promoted by Japan alone. We have always advocated that only by bringing politics in the peace zone onto the right track, establishing security, and stabilizing the people's livelihood, can we use these facts to win over the people under the rule of Chongqing, so that they will gladly return. In this way, the Chongqing regime will inevitably become an empty shell that has lost the hearts of the people and will definitely be unable to exist. Conversely, if we do not strive to win the hearts of the people, but want to complete comprehensive peace by negotiating with the Chongqing regime, it can be said that we are abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial.</p>
<h3>Cooperating in Building Greater East Asia, China and Japan Conclude Alliance Treaty; Troops Will Be Withdrawn When Comprehensive Peace is Restored</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – China and Japan signed an alliance treaty in Nanjing on the 30th, marking a new stage in the relations between the two countries. The relationship between China and Japan in the past three years has transformed from hostility to friendship with the Basic Treaty signed in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China. By December of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and our Chairman Wang declared that he would share weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. On January 9th of this year, our country declared war on Britain and the United States, stating that in order to revive China and defend East Asia, we were determined to live and die with Japan. At the same time, Japan also declared its assistance to China in achieving autonomy and independence, and subsequently returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, implementing a series of measures to assist China in achieving autonomy and independence. Today's situation in East Asia is different from that of three years ago. Sino-Japanese relations have also advanced to the realm of shared destiny, thus the Basic Treaty that formerly regulated Sino-Japanese relations was abolished due to the changes of the times. The conclusion of a new alliance treaty is indeed an inevitable trend of history. The establishment of this China-Japan alliance treaty will not only enable China to restore its sovereignty, but also make a great contribution to the construction of the entire Greater East Asia. The joint communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda is recorded below.</p>
<p>October 30th, 11:00 AM, Joint Communique of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda: At 10:00 AM today, Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Empire of Japan, signed the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan and the related protocols, and exchanged official documents, which were completed at 10:40 AM. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan</h3>
<p>The National Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the Empire of Japan, hoping that the two countries will be good neighbors to each other, respect their self-determination and independence, and cooperate closely to build Greater East Asia based on morality, so as to contribute to the peace of the entire world, and with the firm determination to eliminate all obstacles to this goal, agree as follows: Article 1: The Republic of China and Japan, in order to permanently maintain the relationship of good neighborliness and friendship between the two countries, shall solemnly respect each other's sovereignty and territory, and seek methods of mutual assistance and harmony in all aspects. Article 2: The Republic of China and Japan, for the purpose of building Greater East Asia and ensuring its stability, shall cooperate closely with each other and provide as much assistance as possible. Article 3: The Republic of China and Japan shall implement close economic cooperation between the two countries based on reciprocity. Article 4: The details necessary for the implementation of this treaty shall be decided by the relevant authorities of the two countries through consultation. Article 5: From the date of the implementation of this treaty, the Basic Relations Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan, signed on November 30, 1940, namely November 30, Showa 15, together with all its subordinate documents, shall become invalid. Article 6: This treaty shall come into effect from the date of signing.</p>
<p>The undersigned, being duly authorized by their respective governments, have signed and sealed this treaty to attest to its adherence. Done at Nanjing on the thirtieth day of October in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, the thirtieth day of October in the eighteenth year of Showa, in two copies in Chinese and Japanese.</p>
<p>Wang Zhao-ming, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Empire of Japan.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Protocol</h3>
<p>At the time of signing the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan on this day, the plenipotentiaries of the two countries agreed as follows: Article 1: The Empire of Japan promises to withdraw its troops stationed in the territory of the Republic of China when full peace is restored between the two countries and the state of war is over.</p>
<p>The Empire of Japan hereby waives all rights to station troops based on the Beijing Protocol of the Boxer Rebellion and its related documents. Article 2: This protocol shall be implemented simultaneously with the treaty. To this end, the plenipotentiaries of the two countries have signed and sealed this protocol to attest to its adherence. Done at Nanjing on the thirtieth day of October in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, the thirtieth day of October in the eighteenth year of Showa, in two copies in Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<h3>Capital Citizens' Celebration Rally; Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – At 10:00 AM today, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded. At 11:00 AM, after the Ministry of Propaganda officially announced it, Chairman Wang personally attended the Capital Citizens and Youth Celebration Rally for the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and delivered an address. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A New Era Opens in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has been signed today, marking the opening of a new era in Sino-Japanese relations and a new era in East Asia. From now on, China and Japan will stand on a completely equal and mutually beneficial footing and form a permanent friendly relationship to jointly devote themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. The relationship between China and Japan, between nations and ethnicities, has lasted for more than two thousand years. During these two thousand years, there have been conflicts for a very small amount of time, only a few years to a dozen years, which is less than one percent. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the time has been peaceful. However, this is the first time that a treaty that completely bases itself on the Eastern spirit of morality and stipulates the friendly relations between the two countries has been established. This completely sweeps away the traces of the unequal treaties that China has suffered for a hundred years and completely restores the original face of our East Asian compatriots. From now on, the friendly relations between China and Japan will become stronger day by day, and the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be expanded day by day.</p>
<p>Basic Relations Treaty Expires</p>
<p>Comparing this time's Alliance Treaty with the Basic Relations Treaty signed on November 30, 1940, we can see great differences. The biggest differences are two points: The first point is that the anti-communist stationing of troops in Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Basic Relations Treaty, the security stationing of troops in Article 4, and the stationing of troops "based on past practice" in Article 5 are completely abolished. In addition, Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Protocol this time declares the abandonment of "all rights to station troops under the Beijing Protocol of the Boxer Rebellion and its related documents." Because this is a particularly detailed provision regarding the right to station troops, this special declaration is made. In addition, Article 3 of the Supplementary Protocol when the Basic Relations Treaty was signed stipulates that "Japanese troops, except for those stationed in accordance with the Basic Relations Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan signed today, and the existing agreements between the two countries, shall begin to withdraw their troops when the state of comprehensive peace and war between the two countries ends. The withdrawal of troops shall be completed within two years after security is established. The government of the Republic of China shall guarantee the establishment of security during this period." Article 1 of the Supplementary Protocol this time stipulates that "the Empire of Japan promises to withdraw its troops stationed in the territory of the Republic of China when the state of comprehensive peace and war between the two countries ends," completely abolishing the attached period and conditions this time (continued on the second page).</p>

<h3>Spare No Effort to Support and Promote the Construction of a New China: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Important Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement regarding the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty on the 30th, stating: "The conclusion of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan today establishes a foundation for a new relationship between China and Japan, which is truly cause for celebration for both China and Japan. At the same time, the construction of Greater East Asia has taken another step forward, which is of great significance. The Empire has long desired that all countries in Greater East Asia respect each other's self-determination and independence, cooperate closely in the construction of Greater East Asia, and base themselves on a moral order of co-existence and co-prosperity, so as to contribute to the peace of the world. However, the ambition of the British and American empires to dominate Asia and their plot to sow discord among the East Asian nations have obstructed the realization of this ideal. In order to crush the ambitions of Britain and the United States and seek self-preservation and self-defense, the Empire resolutely took up arms. Recently, with the sincere cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and with firm determination, we have been advancing towards the completion of the war goals and the construction of Greater East Asia. The relationship between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has become even closer, and the friendly relations between Japan and Thailand have also been enhanced. In addition, Burma and the Philippines have successively gained independence, so the old order of Britain and the United States has been expelled from Greater East Asia, and the great cause of reviving Greater East Asia is advancing steadily. At the beginning of this year, the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, stating its determination to live and die with the Empire and jointly complete the war. The Empire expects to promote the healthy development of both countries based on the fundamental spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation, hopes for China's autonomy and independence, and exerts political force to construct a new China. It also decided to return all the Empire's exclusive concessions in China, recognize China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, implement the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and take various goodwill measures. All of the above have been completely new. At the same time, the more the Republic of China promotes the construction of a new China, the more it will gain the fruits of cooperative warfare. The smooth progress of Sino-Japanese relations has continued to this day. Today, we have fundamentally revised the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and concluded the Alliance Treaty. I believe that this Alliance Treaty is adapted to the new situation in Greater East Asia and stipulates the inherent relationship between China and Japan. The great war goals and the belief in victory have enabled the conclusion of this treaty. From now on, the Empire will spare no effort to provide all possible support to promote the construction of a new China, based on the fundamental spirit of this treaty, so that China and Japan can advance together to complete the Greater East Asia War and construct a new order in Greater East Asia."</p>
<p>Remarks by Toyama Mitsuru</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese notable Toyama Mitsuru made the following remarks at his private residence regarding the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, was determined to drive out British forces from various regions of East Asia as soon as possible and build a complete East Asia, so that China could stand on the world stage. Now, as the ten hundred million people of East Asia unite and cooperate to advance the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there is indeed no reason for the opposing side to object. Anyone may have emotional misunderstandings, so I hope the opposing side will quickly wake up and plan for the great cause of standing on the world stage. This great plan has now entered the right track, so from now on, we can only resolutely implement this goal. This time's Sino-Japanese alliance is the same as what Dr. Sun Yat-sen said before, so from now on, the people of China and Japan should sincerely and earnestly work together to annihilate Britain and the United States and then stop.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani and President Wang Deliver Speeches One After the Other</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki delivered the following full text of his speech at the ceremony for the signing of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan:</p>
<p>"Today, I am most pleased to sign with Your Excellency the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan, which stipulates the permanent friendly relationship between China and Japan and the close cooperation for the construction of Greater East Asia, as well as the Supplementary Protocol, and to sign and exchange official documents.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia has changed dramatically. China and Japan are not only no longer taken advantage of by third countries to engage in fraternal strife, but also cooperate with each other and return to the original relationship that should be followed on the path to coexistence and co-prosperity. This is truly a major turning point in Asian history. In order to adapt to this new situation, contribute to the integrity of the Republic of China's autonomy and independence, and promote its revival and prosperity, the Empire has decided to make efforts together with the two countries standing on the same position, so as to achieve the great cause of building Greater East Asia as a fundamental policy. Since the beginning of this year, we have been working hard to achieve its concrete realization. This Alliance Treaty is also a manifestation of the new relationship between China and Japan in the most solemn form. Therefore, I believe that the aforementioned fundamental policy of the Empire and the firm determination of the Empire to implement this policy can be fully expressed.</p>
<p>Due to the signing of this Alliance Treaty, the Basic Relations Treaty between the Republic of China and Japan, signed on November 30, 1940, and its accompanying documents, have all lost their validity. From now on, the basic relationship between China and Japan will be based on the provisions of this Alliance Treaty. Therefore, this treaty can be said to have epoch-making significance for realizing the new situation in Greater East Asia and the new relationship between China and Japan. The joint declaration of China and Japan on January 9 clearly stated the cooperative relationship between China and Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. Now that we have concluded an alliance treaty that permanently and fundamentally regulates the relationship between the two countries, the two countries will surely have a great development unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>The great significance of this Alliance Treaty and its accompanying documents has been described above. It goes without saying that its brilliance will be further enhanced when comprehensive peace is restored in the Republic of China in the future. I am even more convinced that the people of the Republic of China will do their utmost to return to their original state and work together with the Empire in the great cause of Asia. The Empire will undoubtedly continue to make unremitting efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War with a sure-win attitude. There is no doubt that this common cause of China will gain epoch-making progress with the conclusion of this treaty. I sincerely hope that the Republic of China and the Empire can thoroughly understand the true essence of this Alliance Treaty, so as to strive for the construction of Greater East Asia and ensure stability, and promote the world historical significance of this Alliance Treaty. Today, at the signing ceremony of this historical treaty, I would like to briefly state my feelings as a tribute."</p>
<p>President Wang's Reply After Ambassador Tani's speech, President Wang replied:</p>
<p>"Today, Your Excellency and I signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and its Supplementary Protocol and exchanged official documents. I offer my deepest congratulations for the future of the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan and for the future of the construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>I am deeply impressed by Ambassador's high-minded remarks. As Your Excellency said, the signing of this Alliance Treaty has epoch-making significance. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, your country has exerted its national strength to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, and at the same time, it has proclaimed the great meaning of East Asian co-prosperity and united the countries and ethnic groups of East Asia to work together to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the realization of Greater East Asian co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Our country and your country are originally fraternal countries. Your country has opened up a bright future for Greater East Asia. The National Government and people of our country are also working hard to share the responsibility for the construction of Greater East Asia. On January 9 this year, our country and your country issued a joint declaration, clearly stating our unwavering determination and belief to fully cooperate in military, political, and economic affairs to complete the common war against Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Today, with the establishment of the Alliance Treaty and the exchange of documents in the Supplementary Protocol, the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty signed on November 30, 1940, and all its attached documents, have lost their effect. The National Government and people of our country deeply understand your country's kindness in assisting our country to complete its independence and autonomy, so that our country can further engage in restoration and make its national strength and people's strength more abundant, and our cooperation in the Greater East Asia War can be more freely exerted.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that from now on, the foundation of the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan will be strong and unshakable, and will continue to grow. I also deeply hope that the overall peace within China will be restored, which will accelerate its pace and lead to success. This Alliance Treaty has achieved extremely great achievements in Sino-Japanese friendship and in the Eastern spirit of righteousness. The National Government and the people can only fulfill the treaty with the most sincere and enthusiastic spirit, so as not to let down your country's kindness.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, since the beginning of the negotiations on the revision of the treaty, has used profound sympathy and far-sighted vision for the future of China, Japan, and Greater East Asia...[To complete this glorious mission, the enemy pays tribute to his admiration.]"</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) Following the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the Japanese government issued the following statement: The Imperial Government, on this 30th day, entered into the "Alliance Treaty between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China" with the government of the Republic of China. Upon the conclusion of this treaty, the "Basic Treaty Regarding Relations between Japan and the Republic of China" and its affiliated documents shall immediately lose their effect. The treaty relationship between China and Japan has thus seen an epoch-making development. The Imperial Government previously issued a statement on January 9 of this year, clarifying the Empire's policy towards China adapting to the new situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Empire has been implementing the matters specified in that statement. Currently, we are actively providing assistance for the rapid construction of a new China based on the autonomy and independence of China and the exertion of the political power of the National Government. At the same time, the National Government is responding to the policies of the Japanese government, striving for self-strengthening, and enhancing cooperation in the war. The new relationship between China and Japan is thus developing smoothly.</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in Greater East Asia has changed accordingly. When this war broke out, the United Kingdom and the United States engaged in many interventions in Greater East Asia. The Empire had to consider the brutal facts of the United Kingdom and the United States when concluding the Sino-Japanese Treaty. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been driven out of Greater East Asia, and the National Government has also declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries of China and Japan have removed all obstacles of the past and returned to the original state of friendly neighborliness. Now, in order to jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and seek its revival, we aim to achieve the common mission of the two countries. Regarding the treaty relationship, it has been jointly recognized that there is a need to adapt it to the new situation and adjust it. This is the reason for the eventual conclusion of this new treaty.</p>
<p>The Empire has previously established close cooperative relations with Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and other countries based on morality. Now, we are establishing a new foundation for cooperation between the Republic of China and Japan, ensuring a new order of coexistence and co-prosperity for the countries of Greater East Asia, which is progressing steadily. Here, the Imperial Government, in addition to expecting that the relations between the two countries will have an epoch-making development based on the fundamental spirit of the new Sino-Japanese Treaty, will spare no effort to provide all assistance for the completion of the autonomy and independence of the Republic of China, in order to jointly move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. I hereby declare to China and foreign countries what the Imperial Government believes.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Broadcast Last Night to Help the Public Understand the True Meaning of the Alliance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) China and Japan signed the Alliance Treaty on the 30th, from which the two countries formed a permanent friendly relationship, closely cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia. Its significance is extremely important. In order to enable the national public to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the alliance, Chairman Wang made a national broadcast at 9:30 PM on the 30th, explaining the contents of the alliance. In the end, he encouraged the people of the country to advance bravely with a spirit of enduring hardship and to make persistent efforts to complete the mission of restoring and revitalizing China and defending East Asia. His words were extremely refined and earnest. After listening respectfully to the leader's instructions on the radio, the national public was extremely moved, and it was not until 10:45 PM that the broadcast ended.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu's Thoughts on the Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) After the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Gu Zhengzhi, met with the Japanese reporter group at 3:00 PM on the 30th and said as follows: The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded by the people of China and Japan in a state of shared consciousness, without any interference from third parties, and with the same intentions. Today, during the signing ceremony, recalling General Abe and others who had devoted their efforts to the conclusion of the Basic Treaty, it is further understood that the satisfactory completion of the Basic Treaty in the complicated national defense relationship is the foundation for the conclusion of the alliance this time. This treaty can be said to be immeasurable. This is not a legal opposition like Anglo-American treaties, but a relationship of moral trust, so it will surely increase the extraordinary power of East Asia. As for how significant an impact this treaty will have, there is no need for us to elaborate. I feel like seeing the sun shining, and there is no need to ask whether the mountains, trees, and plants will benefit from it. In addition, due to the establishment of the new treaty, the organization and staffing of the embassy may undergo appropriate reforms, which is uncertain. However, from now on, we will naturally engage in everything based on new concepts.

They can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category is related to the opening of the second front and other military issues, and the second category is related to the cooperation of the three powers after the war.

The third type of agreement between the three countries is to establish a permanent anti-Axis Allied group, granting them the power to solve current military and political 　problems.</p>

The original text is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Following the order of the Municipal Government: Effective November 1st, the Third Police Bureau and the West Shanghai Police Bureau will be abolished, and their respective sub-bureaus will be directly under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. Now, the following measures are stipulated in accordance with the summary of the merger: Regarding the reorganization of personnel after the abolition of the two bureaus, it should be implemented in accordance with the following plan. For the sake of handling unfinished matters, an office will be established in each of the Third Police Bureau and the Fourth West Shanghai Police Bureau, named "Dispatch Office of the First Police Bureau" and "West Shanghai Office of the First Police Bureau." The personnel required for this office will only be from the remaining or dispatched personnel of each office, and no office director should be appointed. The deadline is the end of November. The Central Sub-bureau will be relocated to the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau, and the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau and the Xiaodongmen Sub-bureau will be abolished, and the Huangpu Sub-bureau will be newly established to administer the Central Sub-bureau and half of the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau area (east of Route Tenant de Mayran) and the Xiaodongmen area. The Central Sub-bureau should relocate to the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau as soon as possible starting from November 1st and form the Huangpu Sub-bureau. The organizational matters of the Huangpu Sub-bureau should be handled according to a separate plan. The remaining half of the McTyeire Road Sub-bureau area should be under the jurisdiction of the Avenue Joffre Sub-bureau on October 30th. The Xiaodongmen Sub-bureau will be renamed the Xiaodongmen Police Station of the Huangpu Sub-bureau starting from November 1st.

The Third and Fourth Sub-bureaus will be merged into the Changning Road Sub-bureau, located at the former site of the Third Sub-bureau. The director of the Fourth West Shanghai Police Bureau should carry out the reorganization matters according to a separate plan on October 30th. The expenses for the relocation should be negotiated between the First and Third Police Bureaus and the Finance Department of the Public Works Bureau in the district. Other matters will be announced separately."</p>
<p>Commissioner Tojo Speaks</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Tojo of the First and Third Police Bureaus stated when interviewed by a reporter from The Times yesterday: The First, Third Police Bureaus, and the former Fourth West Shanghai Police Force will be merged on November 1st. However, the police system of the First and Eighth districts in the former concession era each had different foreign colors, especially the former French Concession, which was very similar to the French army system. In any case, today we will gradually replace it with a police system based on the Chinese government under the same ruling order. Regarding the resistance of personnel in each police district to orders issued under the new system, it will be prevented, but the advantages of the foreign system will still be retained, such as the system of the complaint room, which is one of them. Regarding the number of police officers, Mr. Tojo said that it is more than sufficient to cope with the situation. For example, Tokyo has a population of seven million, but the number of police officers is only 16,000. Based on this ratio, the police force in this city should be stronger than theirs.</p>

<h3>Alleviate Coal Ball Panic: Hoping to Raise Remedial Measures to Reduce the Burden on People's Lives and Alleviate the City</h3>
<p>Coal balls, an indispensable item for cooking for residents, are currently in very short supply. It is not easy for residents to buy even a small amount of coal balls. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited various merchants selling coal balls. All the merchants, in order to meet the needs of retail sales, dispatched personnel late at night or overnight, carrying containers, to the manufacturers of waste products traded in the market, waiting to obtain coal residue from vehicles the next day. The amount of coal balls produced was only a few loads, or four or five loads at most. However, residents were already lining up in front of the store, and although they were limited to purchasing five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person, the quantity was insufficient and quickly bought up. Residents, unable to purchase sufficient coal balls, tried various methods, resulting in a black market "trade." If this situation continues for a long time, it will not only hinder the people's livelihood but also affect the overall public security of society. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities will adhere to their original intention and quickly devise remedial measures to immediately clarify this kind of illegal situation. Three Major Causes of Current Shortage</p>
<p>According to another source yesterday, there are approximately three major causes for the current shortage of coal balls: Manufacturers, citing high costs, requested a slight increase in the selling price, which was ultimately rejected by the authorities, thus reducing production. Distributors, due to the limited supply of coal residue obtained by vehicles and the high demand, and because the fixed profit was insufficient to cover expenses, sold on the black market to obtain illegal profits. The source of coal residue has slightly decreased, and the authorities are in the process of reorganizing the distribution mechanism, so the raw materials obtained by each factory are not as sufficient as in the past.</p>

<h3>Sports: Popularization Cup Round Gateball: Yesterday's Inaugural Game: The Paramount Ballroom Sadly Lost to West Qing</h3>
<p>Mr. Xia Shikui, enthusiastic about sports, initiated the Popularization Cup Round Gateball Tournament.

<p>The Course of Three Matches of Men and Women's Competition</p>
<p>The Chinese Film V team was the first to appear on the field. The Chinese Film team lived up to expectations. In the first half, the Chinese Film team won by three goals. After the change of sides, Chen Lianfa and Deng Nianceng of the V team successively scored, showing a resurgence. The Chinese Film team was also not weak. Xu Liangjin and Jia Biao also made contributions. When time ran out, the Chinese Film team won 6 to 3. The women's match began, with Huang Mingyuan and Rong Shujian working together. Mingyuan raised her ape arm high, and the ball should have hit the net. In less than two minutes, Zhu Chengran returned after scoring. The Fourth Youth team initially scored a goal back by M Jiekuluofu, ending the first half. After the change of sides, Lin Nuofu of the West Qing team shot horizontally and hit the target, but Wang Yinlan failed to save it, making it 2 to 2. The Green team attacked, and Yan Weiwen and Huang Mingyuan both scored. The West Qing team ultimately lost by one goal, losing 3 to 4. In the final match, the Paramount's goalkeeper Dong Jincai made a mistake, and Yao Chong had to replace him temporarily, sowing the seeds of disaster. The ball entered the restricted area, and none of them were able to stop it. Funk of the West Qing team scored three consecutive goals, and Tao Bolingji took advantage of the situation to hit the target, causing the Paramount players to lose their fighting spirit. In the first half, the West Qing team took the lead with 7 to 2. In the second half, the Paramount team tried to counterattack, and Zhang Shaoqing and Bao Songyuan both made contributions. However, the score difference was too great, and the West Qing team ultimately defeated the Paramount Ballroom by 8 to 4.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Newspaper Publication Time: 7:50 PM</p>
<h3>Commentary: Employment Agencies</h3>
<p>The previous discussion of the misery of unemployment is because increasing production depends on the simultaneous concentration of human and material resources. While the nation loudly calls for increased production, it cannot stand idly by and watch the unemployment of its people. Therefore, it is necessary to provide vigorous assistance to employment agencies and establish them widely. This can alleviate some of the severity of unemployment and solve some of the economic problems of the whole community.</p>
<p>Before, the city's employment agencies included the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute attached to the China Vocational Education Society, the Vocational Guidance Department of the YMCA, and the Vocational Introduction Section of the Chinese Students' Association of the World. These were all run by private organizations and had achieved considerable success. However, they were unfortunately suspended one after another due to financial constraints. Since the Greater East Asia War, the municipal authorities, recognizing the importance of the employment service, have actively shouldered the responsibility through the Social Welfare Bureau of the First District Public Office in order to solve the pain of unemployment for citizens, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Allied Japan has a well-developed employment service and has achieved considerable success, which can be learned from. Other countries in the world are also paying attention to promoting it. China has been slow to implement it, and the public lacks understanding of it, so the process of development is slow. In the future, we should pay attention to guidance and strive for universal understanding. Contact with the industrial and commercial sectors is also essential. We must also change the traditional system of only using personal connections in the past and be able to select real talents, so that individuals and careers can benefit, in order to achieve the goal of matching the right person with the right job.</p>
<p>Under the current wartime system, it is necessary to concentrate all efforts to develop production. The issue of talent cannot be ignored. Universally solving unemployment and fairly selecting talents depend on the large-scale establishment of public employment agencies. It is hoped that all parties will do their best to advocate, promote, and develop such an enterprise for the welfare of the country and society.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Sets Management Regulations for Brokers</h3>
<p>Strict Supervision to Prevent Manipulation</p>
<p>After receiving orders to prepare for the resumption of business, the Chinese Securities Exchange has already made preparations and will officially start trading in the middle of next month. It is learned that the operating rules of the exchange have been approved and announced by the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In the future, all transactions must be carried out in accordance with the rules and cannot be arbitrarily changed. It is also learned that the stock exchange authorities will strictly supervise the brokers.</p>
<p>The regulations are as follows: Brokers should abide by the regulations, operating rules, market announcements, and all instructions of the exchange, and must not disobey under the pretext of ignorance. Brokers should be responsible for all transactions generated by their trading at the exchange. Brokers should set up business premises within the designated location of the exchange.

Other detailed regulations are also in place regarding the transfer of business and closing down of brokers, and no arbitrary changes are allowed. It is also learned that after the resumption of business this time, spot trading will be temporarily opened first, and brokers will be prohibited from engaging in manipulation.</p>
<h3>Tenth Period of the Month Completed</h3>
<p>Today is the tenth period of the month for industry and commerce. Various firms in the banking and finance industries are handling maturing loans and new long-term credit loans separately under the principle of practical financial tightening. It has been completed as of yesterday. It is reported that the collection of credit loans maturing in the tenth period of the month is quite good, ranging from one month to six months. In addition, the interest rate for new loan agreements is renegotiated to be increased. It is said that the repayment rate for maturing loans is about 70%, while the accommodation extension rate is only 20% to 30%. Various firms granting credit loans still grant loans appropriately, but the application must be for a sufficient purpose and have reliable guarantors, and it is limited to those who develop production. Although the interest rate is determined by the market, it is generally about 30 yuan per month. It is said that the number of new loans concluded is not small. Today is Sunday, and various firms are closed as usual. All the procedures that should be handled for the tenth period of the month were completed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stocks started high and ended low, with a slight drop at the end. Rumors that had been circulating for days were swept away, and people gradually became unsustainable. In the afternoon, many short sellers also covered their positions, making the situation even weaker. Weekend trading was not strong. Due to the scheduled formal resumption of business by the stock exchange, major bulls did not move. Although each stock was slightly limited, they are described below by industry.</p>

<h3>Interest-Free Discount of Yarn and Cloth Orders Should Be Handled Through Negotiation Between Both Parties</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association previously received reports from the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth No. Bank and Industry Associations, stating that since the National Government ordered the purchase of yarn and cloth materials, various yarn and cloth merchants had no cash reserves, and the banks immediately stopped granting credit. As a result, the number of banks forced loan repayment, and internal operating expenses were strained. The economic difficulties encountered were urgent. Furthermore, the salaries of various employees were used to support their families, totaling hundreds of thousands of people. Since there was no cash to pay them, the public was panicked and unable to resolve the current difficulties. They requested the Commercial Control Association to urgently seek relief from the Executive Yuan, and to approve interest-free discount of the special fixed-term deposit slips for the purchase of yarn and cloth, in order to maintain livelihoods. The Commercial Control Association forwarded the request to the Executive Yuan for review. It has recently been learned from reporters that the association has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating: "The loan discount granted by banks to cloth firms is based on the contract signed by both parties. The request to approve interest-free discount of the special fixed-term deposit slips for the purchase of yarn and cloth should still be handled through negotiation between both parties. The instructions should be forwarded for notification." After the Commercial Control Association issued the order, it was learned that it has been forwarded to the relevant associations and banking industry associations.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the special fixed-term deposit slips issued for the purchase of yarn and cloth have been approved by the Executive Yuan, with September 6th as the starting date.</p>
<h3>National Capital Rally: Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>Continued from the first page</p>
<p>The second point is Article 6, Section 2 of the Japan-China Basic Relations Treaty, which contains the words "North China and Jiang...", and the third section also has the same words, as well as the words "Lower Yangtze Region," which easily gives people the feeling that there are special zones within Chinese territory, and makes them feel that not only in the economic aspect, but also in the political and military aspects, there is a risk of division and disunity. Now, Article 3 of the Alliance Treaty completely eliminates this worry about special zones. The first point concerns China's freedom, and the second point concerns China's unity, both of which are extremely important. In addition, what is extremely important is that Article 5 of the Alliance Treaty stipulates, "From the date of implementation of this treaty, the Treaty on Basic Relations between the Republic of China and Japan, signed on November 30, 1940, i.e., November 30, Showa 15, and all attached documents shall be invalidated together." In the past, many people suspected that in addition to the Basic Relations Treaty, there were also so-called secret agreements, and even if there were no secret agreements, there must be undisclosed documents among all the attached documents. Now, seeing the provisions of Article 5, all doubts can vanish like clouds. Moreover, the Alliance Treaty signed this time, in addition to the attached protocol and one exchange of notes, does not have any other attached documents, which shows the utmost openness and uprightness.</p>
<p>Independent and Autonomous,</p>
<p>Becoming Increasingly Sound. Furthermore, it should be solemnly pointed out that the exchange of notes this time makes the meaning of the already established facts mentioned in the attached protocol to the Basic Relations Treaty even more clear and detailed. Article 1 of the attached protocol mentions the existence of so-called special circumstances, and Article 3 mentions the continuation of matters handled by the so-called established regime. For the past three years, the Japanese government has been frankly and openly discussing these two kinds of already established facts with the National Government, and has been adjusting them within the scope of possibility. Since the implementation of the new policy, in order to assist China in achieving independence and autonomy, it has been carrying out these adjustments more resolutely. Many adjusted facts have already been seen by the world. The exchange of notes this time fully expresses this determination. Of course, a complete adjustment can only be achieved when full peace is restored and the state of war ends. However, even while the state of war continues, adjustments can be made at any time through consultations between the two countries, as permitted by the circumstances. This is entirely in accordance with the purpose of this Alliance Treaty, to further strengthen the National Government and make China's independence and autonomy increasingly sound. Such kindness is truly moving.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be stated incidentally that Article 4 of the Alliance Treaty stipulates, "The details necessary for the implementation of this treaty shall be decided through consultations between the competent authorities of the two countries." According to domestic law, foreign affairs are handled by the central government. When local officials encounter foreign affairs, they must obtain the permission of the central government and act in accordance with its intentions before they can handle them. There are also some specific matters that the central government must go through the legislative procedures of the Central Political Committee and the Legislative Yuan. These are all provisions of domestic law and matters of course, so there is no need to explain them. I am stating this incidentally because I am concerned that some people may misunderstand.</p>
<p>Laying the Cornerstone for Permanent Friendship</p>
<p>At the time of signing the Basic Relations Treaty, I made a sincere explanation to the concerns of the people. I said that the provisions in the treaty have a lot of flexibility, depending on how we work hard. If we work hard, we can make it move in a good direction; otherwise, it will only move in a bad direction. For example, the length of time for stationing troops, the number of additional troop locations, the number of troops, and the amount of... are not fixed. If our strength can restore peace throughout the country and completely cure the disease, then the time for troop stationing will definitely be short, and the number of troop locations and troops will definitely be small. Conversely, there will be longer... and more troop stationing... Our economic strength is also the same. If the direction is correct, there will be many economic talents. If economic technology advances and rationalization is achieved, then the economy can achieve the goal of mutual benefit. Otherwise, it will only decline. I believe there is reason for this explanation. Since we have signed the treaty, we have an obligation to abide by it, and there is no other hope for improvement other than what I have said above. However, the Japanese government proposed the intention to fundamentally revise the treaty this time, and the drafts of the Alliance Treaty and the attached protocol and exchange of notes were also proposed by the Japanese government. The special rights that the Japanese side obtained in the previous treaty were abandoned, without any reservation. At the same time, all the points that the Chinese side was worried about were thoroughly eliminated.</p>
<p>Today, I openly tell my fellow countrymen that this revised treaty is entirely out of the goodwill of the Japanese government and people. For the sake of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and for the sake of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, based on the spirit of... and the feelings of compatriots, they have put forward such a bright and upright proposition, giving China the strength to be reborn from the dead. They have laid the cornerstone for permanent friendship between China and Japan, and have opened up a road to peace that is in line with justice for East Asia.</p>
<p>Consistent Ideals Fully Realized</p>
<p>Now I have a few more words to tell my fellow countrymen: Why does Japan have this determination and implementation this time? Speaking of the concept of "good-neighborly friendship," it was already evident in the Konoe Statement. However, at that time, the Greater East Asia War had not yet broken out, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States still existed within China, spreading to all aspects of politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. Those who generally... take the stationing of troops as an example. The Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War already had a starting point, and it became increasingly serious after the Boxer Rebellion. In that case, if Japan wanted to abolish the so-called long-standing practice and act alone, it would not only... China's... but would also increase the danger of Britain and the United States becoming more arbitrary. The troop stationing issue is like this, and other economic issues are no exception.</p>
<p>At the time of signing the Basic Relations Treaty, Japan took this into consideration and had to make some arrangements. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the power of Britain and the United States in China was completely crushed, and this consideration was no longer necessary, so many arrangements were no longer necessary either. From the agreement signed ahead of schedule on January 9 this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, to the recent fundamental revision of the treaty, the ideals have been consistent. Fellow countrymen, what should we do now? At the beginning of the outbreak of the China Incident, most of our fellow countrymen believed that resisting would lead to destruction, and not resisting would also lead to destruction. Holding this pessimistic psychology, they engaged in resistance. At the beginning of the peace movement, some people still believed that cooperation between China and Japan was hopeless, and holding this pessimistic psychology, they rejected peace. Over the past few years, although there have been various facts that can prove that peace is not hopeless, there have also been various contrary facts that have delayed the decision and action. Now, the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Father of the Nation has moved from theory to practice. The Father of the Nation's hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties has been seen in reality. The Father of the Nation's will, which called on comrades who died later to continue their efforts to abolish unequal treaties, has been thoroughly implemented. Today, we can only, based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, solidify the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows and sharing life and death since the Greater East Asia War as firm as gold and stone. We must concentrate the total strength of the nation until the Greater East Asia War is completed and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is accomplished, so that China's independence and freedom can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Permanently Form a Friendly Relationship</p>
<p>Recalling the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing side once publicly said, "Peace can only be realized if we return to the state before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident." In today's state, it is not only returning to the state before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, but it has also exceeded it several times. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China had concessions, but now they have been returned. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China had foreign... The power to... Foreign people... and laws existed in China, but now they have been abolished. Every place within Lugouqiao was a transfer station for semi-colonies, but now the aggressive state of Britain and the United States... The unequal treaties of hundreds of years have been abandoned. Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan had divergent policies and strained relations, but now they have consistent policies and a permanent friendly relationship has been formed. What is needed now is for the Chongqing side to abandon resistance and restore peace. This is beneficial to the overall situation in East Asia, and it is especially beneficial to China itself. Because on this basis, Japan will fulfill its withdrawal of troops, and the state of war within Chinese territory will end immediately. Various construction projects for peace and rehabilitation will begin immediately.</p>
<p>China is in a rear position in the Greater East Asia War. Of course, it should not forget to send elite troops to the front line to share the hardships of the allied soldiers. However, establishing security and increasing production are the urgent tasks of the rear. In this way, China will not only fulfill its rear obligations in the Greater East Asia War, but will also stimulate the recovery and improvement of various matters after the war. This is extremely beneficial to the restoration of China's vitality and the increase of national strength and people's strength. If the Chongqing side does not abandon resistance and restore peace at this time, then the so-called resistance of Chongqing is not resisting for China, but resisting for Britain and the United States. They not only want to provide their own territory to Britain and the United States as an air base, allowing them to bomb their own compatriots, but they also want to turn places that could have been settled and restored into... for Britain and the United States... At the same time, they also want to transport a large number of troops to the Myanmar region to be lackeys of Britain and the United States in order to resist... Those in East Asia who already have independent nascent states, such actions are not only traitors to East Asia, but also sinners of China. I hope that the generals, soldiers, and people of Chongqing will recognize this clearly and quickly determine the path they should take. There is still time at this time. Delaying it by one day will delay it by one day.</p>
<p>I remember that I led a small number of comrades, empty-handed, out of Chongqing, and have been running for the peace movement for five years now. Without virtue or ability, I have been able to receive such assistance from Japan, enabling China to fulfill its aspirations for independence and freedom. I sincerely thank the Japanese government and people for this kindness. At the same time, I think of my old companions on the Chongqing side, who have not yet come over. I am really heartbroken. I sincerely pray to the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven to silently... urge us to promote unity. We vow to use the spirit of courage, diligence, hard work, and perseverance to continue our efforts to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. (End)</p>
<h3>National Forum: Unjustified Shortages of Sugar, Rice, and Flour Coupons</h3>
<p>— Ping Ming</p>
<p>The amount and duration of household rice in western Shanghai (areas beyond the settlement limits) are different from those in the first to eighth districts—the amount is smaller and the duration is uncertain. Last winter, it was issued once every six weeks. In the past, there was a relationship with the settlements, but now that the settlements have been recovered, the amount of household rice in western Shanghai is still less than that in the first to eighth districts; the first to eighth districts have at least one sheng, while western Shanghai has already received brown rice and broken rice of nine he three times; the distribution agencies for the first to eighth districts are the Economic Department, while western Shanghai is the Food Administration Bureau—this bad phenomenon is getting worse day by day.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last month, the Food Administration Bureau sent personnel to the first, sixth, and ninth Lianbao of western Shanghai to investigate households. One day, the Jia chief of my Bao came to my house and asked, "Each household must send a representative with their household registration certificate and the residence certificates of all family members to the Bao chief's office for inspection." The western Shanghai authorities stipulated that "residents aged sixty and above and ten and below do not need to obtain residence certificates." There were a total of twenty-three people, large and small, and six of them were under ten years old. Fortunately, they were all at home, so they brought seventeen residence certificates and household registration certificates to report. The staff member was silent during the inspection.</p>
<p>Around the 20th of last month, members of the Huixi Baojia Committee also came to investigate households. One of the investigators of the committee said to me, "Because the Food Administration Bureau wants to deduct the rations of three people, I have come to re-investigate the number of people in the household being deducted and how many residence certificates the whole family has, in order to facilitate negotiations." That afternoon, the Jia chief distributed the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th period rice coupons, and sure enough, three were missing. Three sixth-period sugar coupons were also missing. When I asked the Jia chief, he said, "That's how many the Food Administration Bureau sent." The next day, the 16th, 17th, and 18th period flour coupons were also issued, and three were missing. Some neighbors had one or two deducted, while others had none deducted.</p>
<p>Sixth-period household sugar has been sold in the first to eighth districts since the ninth of last month. Western Shanghai residents were eagerly waiting. They thought that sugar coupons could be issued by the fourteenth (Mid-Autumn Festival), but they waited until around the twentieth, and the sugar coupons were deducted before they were issued. This is puzzling.</p>
<p>On what grounds did the Food Administration Bureau deduct the sugar, rice, and flour coupons of residents? If it is a false declaration of households, why was the investigator silent during the inspection? Why was the number of oil coupons issued for the sixth period not reduced? If sugar, rice, and flour are not adequately distributed, why not announce it in the newspaper? Why are they reduced in Lianbao A but not in Lianbao B? Please investigate the authorities. If the authorities are determined to "purify the officialdom," "eliminate corruption," and "practice integrity," they must conduct a thorough investigation.

<h3>Mr. Liu's Festival Banquet Benefits the Poor</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Liangcai wrote yesterday, "The 27th of this month is the day of my granddaughter's full-month celebration. All relatives and friends sent congratulatory gifts. However, thinking of the turbulent times and the widespread suffering, I would rather create blessings than spend extravagantly on a banquet. Therefore, I will hold a simple banquet on this day to entertain relatives and friends. I respectfully donate the 10,000 yuan saved from the banquet and the 10,000 yuan from relatives and friends, totaling 20,000 yuan, to charity. In addition to donating to the Ningbo Congee Distribution Center, Orphanage, Nursery, Nursing Home, Widow's Home, Tongshan Relief Association, Siming Orphanage, Siming Poor Children's Home, Shanghai Orphanage, Women and Children's Relief Association, Renji Shantang, Mingde Jiyi Association, Xinpu Nursery, Nursing Home, Tushanwan Orphanage, Xujiahui Nursery, Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, and Museum Grain Fund, each 1,000 yuan, I now send 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons to help your newspaper's scholarship fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Institute, each 1,000 yuan. Please transfer them." Liu Liangcai bows respectfully. (Note: The money has been received. Thank you very much. We also hope that the Fuyou Institute will prepare an official receipt to be collected from our newspaper.)</p>
