<p>社評</p>
<h3>加強管制全面現價</h3>
<p>昨日報載各業公會嚴格評定物品標準限價，以期澈底穩定商市，及大規模抑平各種物品售價，這事關於市民生活甚巨，而日還不只上海一地需要實施，即其他各地，也應該切實推行。本報對於物價問題，曾迭有獻曾，我們始終認爲這與政府當局整個經濟政策有密切關係的問題，同時也是整個政治問題的一部份；如果政治問題有了辦法，整個經濟政策有了辦法，那麽這個物價問題就可迎刃而解。同樣的，如果物價問題有了圓滿的解決，那麼一般社會問題也可獲得圓滿的解決，而政府當局的一切政策，也就可以暢行貫澈了。所以我們今日談限價平價，以至穩定商市，首先必須要求政治有辦法，要求萬全的經濟政策之實施，特別是我國旣已參戰，這種要求便更感到迫切。</p>
<p>澈底解決物價問題，主要的和根本的辦法，是要實現通貨緊縮政策，妥善引導游資從事生產，和有組織有計劃的實行增加生產。這是積極方面穩定商市和安定社會的辦法。關於這一方面，本報曾迭獻蒭議，今日不再贅述。不過有了積極的努力，仍需要消極的管制，互相配合，才會更收到更大的效果。所以再就加强管制全面限價諸端，敬獻所見，以爲今日硏究物價問題和辦理物價管制工作者的參考，自然更希望當局和經濟界予以注意。</p>
<p>過去當局對於物價問題，早曾加以硏究，並目決定和實施過許多對策，而且在某一定時期內，似乎曾經收到相當成效。然就各地的事實而論，距離物價管制的理想效果，還是很遠。目前上自政府，下至平民，還是不斷地受着物價問題的不良影響。推究其原因，由於一切管制偏於局部性或地方性的，所謂局部性，是管制所及的範圍有限，只對某幾種物資，或只對某幾種物資的產銷過程中的某一部份實施管制，缺乏全部的周詳萬全約計劃。所謂地區性是說過去的管制，或限於某若干城市或區域，或甲地受管制者，乙地可以自由，或乙地受限制者，甲地則受放縱；即或甲乙各地都受管制，而彼此管制的法令，組織，機構，辦法或參差不一，或寬嚴小同，或互相牽制。這樣要求實際奏效，自然是一大疑問。今後政府應該廣採民間的公意，吸收各界的專門人村，與政府關係機關縝密硏究，決定妥善萬全的對策，實行官民合作的全面的管制。這裏還須注意的是：（一）不僅政府必須密切與民間合作，而且還須與其他政治，經濟，社會各方面的政策互相兼顧，同時並進，所謂全面的管制，決不能由物價管制者孤獨去辦理，必須與政治，經濟，社會各部門各機構作密切爾協力，始能奏效。（二）所謂全面管制，決不是無區別的水平式管制，既應該針對各省市物價問題不同的原因，不同程度的現象，作不能盡同的措施：還應該針對物資的各別種類，性質，用途，價値，生產運銷的特殊情形，而作不盡相同的措施；緩急寬嚴之間，就有妥善分別的必要。（三）管制的機構必須統一，職權必須明確，人事必須整飭，對於執行管制的各級人員，旣必須經過認眞的訓練，還必須隨時進行嚴格的考核。而民間的監督機關和社會與論的尊重，都是不容忽視的要點。我們認爲，只有這樣的全面管制實施之後，再配合政治上的改善和戰時經濟政策的推行，物價問題就可期待合理的解決。</p>
<p>關於限價，在這非常時期，幾乎各國都已實施，不僅交戰各國，莫不早已實施嚴格的物品限價制度，即是中立各國，都已適應環境的需要，實行限價。我國在若干地區，已早經實施，尤以本市爲然。不過，過去因爲種種原因，未能收到預期的效果。所以我們今日不談限價則已；否則，第一，就必實行全面的限價，而不徒爲局部限價。如果只指定極少數的物品，加以限價，而其原料，工資，運輸以及一般有關的生產費用，不斷提高，則限價必失公平。如爲消費品，必至市塲窒息，斷絕來源；如爲生產品，必致妨碍生產，减少物資。又如果限價只及於若干特定地區，更不免造成價格上的突飛猛進，而招致物資供應綫上新的恐慌。所以我們今日必須對全國各地之多數物價，運輸費用及工資等都作普遍的限制。</p>
<p>第二，限價必須根據客觀的事實，不可太憑理想，太講原則　限價標準，在一般理論上有所謂一成本價格」，「生產費用價格」，「標準價格」，「綜合價格」等等，但都須以事實爲藍本。如果規定的價格與成本或生產費用不符之時，那麼政府就必須實現必要的補給制度。至於僅僅限制生產價格，而同時一般商業並不管制，或管制較鬆，更是不合理的。所以限價必須貫澈於商塲，生產，運輸，動力各方面，尤其是公用事業，須首示模範。</p>
<p>當然全面限價，必須與全面管制同時並行。限，是一切平價工作，但決不能與別種平價工作分離，所以，必須在全而管制之下，才能實現全面限價。</p>
<p>最後，我們願强調指出：爲了貫澈穩定物價安定社會的政策，必須使消極的管制與限價與積極的增產等互相配合，才能收到實際的效果，尤其在努力增加生產，節約消費，便利運輸，以平衡供需。而如何管制金融，調整稅法，緊縮預算，以减少通貨的發行，並收回剩餘的購買力；以及嚴密社會組織，使人民協助政府實行經濟檢察，並加强同業公會合作社等，以加强生產，協助分配，再由政府掌握物資，限制漲價，都是今日言管制與限價者不可忽視的要旨。我們希望經濟與政治相輔而行，一掃過去偏畸輕重之弊，那麽管制的理想，才會實現。</p>

<h3>義放棄特利波里與戰局形勢</h3>
<p>北非之德義聯軍，卒將義屬特利波里放棄，兼之去秋喪失以利特伊加，於是義國在利比亞已暫時放棄，此乃歷史上重大之事。按義國於二十餘年前，與土耳其戰爭後，接管里比亞，遂成義國向海外發展之據點。但得失爲戰爭之常，何况北非之沙漠作戰，又因突尼西亞之一戰而轉禍爲福。况大戰結束之際，軸心定博勝利，至時亦可將失地收復。義國國民文化宣傳部長柏波利尼氏，會在廣播演說中激勵人民，希望注意突尼西亞之新局面，並稱：「必勝決心爲最大武器」，「克復里比亞指日可待」。吾人對柏波利尼氏所言，極表同情。</p>
<p>至於目前之北非戰局，自埃及之羅美爾軍防綫被突破後，英國第八軍雖已長驅直抵特利波里，但英軍氣勢不銳，故軸心軍仍能接濟在突尼西亞登陸之亞尼摩將軍。特利波里今日雖失守，但羅美爾將軍如能與亞尼摩將軍取得聯絡，駢肩作戰，且突尼西亞之地勢宜於防守，則軸心在北非之唯一屛障突尼西亞，仍在軸心國掌握，英美之作戰目的，即不易成功。目下北非之軸心軍傾注全力，作最大奮鬥，名將羅美爾自移轉陣地後，已在地理上局部成功，足可維護機械化部隊之兵力。吾人觀察突尼西亞之戰局，即知其地理上之重要性。問題不僅在於非洲之領土，且關乎地中海之制海權，制空權。地中海爲英美對世界作戰之重要地點之一，自突尼西亞東北之可布蘭角至西西里島之馬爾薩拉，直綫不過一百四十四浬，爲防衛義國本身着想，則新戰局對於義大利有極大之關係。（任：譯自一月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>東京二日同盟社電　情報局發言人堀氏、頃評述日方在南太平洋最近勝利稱、帝國海軍航空隊在稜湼爾島外戰役中所獲決定性勝利、實乃日本對英、美在加薩勃朗加會議後誇言一九四三年大攻勢之首次强力答覆、加薩勃朗加會議宣布時、曾向世人侈言允諾於一九四三年發動大攻勢、乃不出一週、協約國即獲首次答覆突、一月二十九日與三十日我帝國海軍航空隊在稜湼爾島外戰役中獲得赫赫之戰果、已粉碎英、美陣營之奢望、而再度證明敵方欲突入日本控制之廣泛區域、胥屬徒勞、美國海長諾克期視察太平洋戰區甫畢、在火奴魯魯向報界倣然宣稱、「準備時期已過去、吾人甫已開始作戰吾人準備猛施打擊、並將繼續猛擊、船舶之損失、乃日本大爲關切之事」、殊可趣也、美海長發此誇言時、其艦隊似適遇最悲痛之慘劇、遭極兇猛之打擊或竟無法報道此噩耗、無論如何、諾克斯今殆欲閉口不言矣、抑諾克斯應不忘「施猛烈打擊」者及眞正關心船舶喪失者、究屬何方、迄今爲止、美國無綫電臺猶以所羅門方面無消息爲言、故料協約國於今後若干時日內、仍將混然不知此重大之　折（戰艦兩艘與巡洋艦三艘沉沒、戰艦一艘與巡洋艦一艘受創、並有戰鬥機三架被擊落）、蓋美國遲遲宣布戰爭損折、是其慣例也、諾克斯等軍雖抱樂觀、然英美人士現亦承　、即使日本最假遠之前哨地、協約國亦無從相微突入、良以檢查縱嚴、究不能隱匿眞相也、如英國軍事評論家福雨斯及撰　刋「倫敦圖畫日報」、內有「協約軍收復日本攻佔之區、希望甚微」之言、又謂「澳洲與美國在新幾內亞並無勝利」、而泰晤士雜誌亦謂協約國雖極努力、然「太平洋戰事並無進展」、美國在太平洋之地位迅趨惡化、已使所謂協約國陣營異常焦慮、而日感失利之困苦矣、澳洲人民對於迫近其海岸之戰局不利、頗爲震驚、澳首相寇丁近曾屢次籲請美國給予史多之援助、而澳外長依凡特且於一二日前亦向澳洲人民曰「澳洲需要更多之美國援助、以應西南太平洋總戰略之正當需要、依凡特發是言時、顯未知美國海軍之慘敗也、無論諾克斯之誇言與加薩勃朗加會議之諾言爲何如、澳洲人民祗得聽命於事實、即若輩所需之援助、繼有到來、亦不過些微耳、至於重慶、聞頗失望於加薩勃朗加會議、合衆社渝電有曰、「非待美國之接濟品、運輸便利及其他必需品經陸地運過緬甸、則中國軍隊不致發動、此間一般咸信重啟緬甸公路對中國之重要性、到處爲人輕視、「重慶之被忽視、一如澳洲、其他「協約國」之欲得美國援助者、亦莫不然、自誇「民主國兵工廠」之接濟品、不致到來、而沙漠地加薩勃則加之會議、已證明一如羅斯福·邱吉爾兩氏此前歷次會議、不過是新諾言與保證構成之沙漠幻景、初無實質、徒令愚人目爲之目眩而已、</p>

<p>瑞典京城二日海通社電　倫敦官方昨夜宣稱、英首相邱吉爾訪問土耳其總統伊斯美曾與接見、土當局與邱吉爾隨員、會談數次、業已商定英美兩國以物質之援助、藉以鞏固土國防之辦法、邱吉爾與伊斯美對於會談結果、均表示此次會談滿意、舉行於一月三十一日、邱吉爾已於昨日返回開羅、</p>
<p>安加拉二日海通社電　土耳其政府今晨發表關於阿達那會議之官方文告稱、此次談話之目的、在於增强土耳其在防務上之安全、邱吉爾在此次會議中、與羅斯福抱有同一之見解、故羅斯福對此會議贊助甚力、該公報中更提及此次會議係徇邱吉爾之請而召集、邱吉爾在土時曾受土耳其政府之招位、阿達那會議舉行於一月三十日及三十一日兩日、</p>
<p>安加拉二日海通社電　上月三十日及三十一日、邱吉爾與土耳其總統伊斯美、在阿達那舉行會議、總統乘火車抵阿達那、邱吉爾登車相會、同往陶魯斯山中總統消夏別墅、此間報章刋載土政府文告、未予評論、政界及外交界人士認為、此次會議之結果、土耳其之中立政策獲勝、據參予會議之土國官員透露、土官方文告、謂關於戰後問題、雙方意見融洽、並未有業已完全承認大西洋憲章之意、衆信英方慫恿土耳其放棄中立、與英·美駢肩作戰、但土當局並未決定放棄中立、</p>
<p>雙方與會代表</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日海通社電　據倫敦昨晚發表官方公報稱、參加阿達那英·土會議之雙方代表如下、土耳其方面為總理薩拉茹格魯、參謀總長卡克馬克上將、外交部長孟納曼茹格魯、外交部副秘書長艾爾金、參謀本部航空專家卡克馬克將軍及參謀本部軍略司司長愷約巴里、英國方面為首相邱吉爾、英國駐土大使許閣森、外交部常務次長賈德幹、帝國參謀總長勃洛克、伊拉克與伊朗英軍總司令威爾遜、中東英軍總司令亞歷山大林德賽中將、中東英國空軍副總司令特魯蒙空軍上將及地中海英軍總司令部參謀處長鄧達斯等、</p>
<p>保京二日海通社電　此間與土耳其間之電話與電報交通中斷、已有四日、此因英國首相邱吉爾在土之故、</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　反軸心各國頃正以羅斯福、邱吉爾談作擴大宣傳之資料、澳洲廣播電臺曾於二日廣播稱、據安加拉電、英·美·土·二國已締結防禦同盟云云、但關於該同盟之內容則絕未言及、故英美兩國之所謂增强以物資運土、亦無非誇大宣傳、</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據倫敦來電、英首相邱吉爾與土耳其總統、已於阿達那近郊專車內舉行會談、聞會議結果、將分別通知羅斯福及斯達林、</p>
<p>柏林並不驚異</p>
<p>柏林二日海通社電　英國當局發表關於邱吉爾訪問土耳其與阿達那會議之官方公報、並未使柏林之驚異、因過去二日來、德國外交部業已獲得關於此事之情報、據英方承認邱吉爾之　　　繼續加薩勃朗加會議中所決定之方針、英國官方文告中雖未提及加薩勃朗加會中曾討論　　事　大　　東之問題、但英國在該處所作之軍事準備、為不可否認之事實、邱吉爾　土耳其之目的、　　　　尼爾之開放、若果獲成功、則蘇聯之船隻可改循此途、以免北極海中航行之　　　　事　為事實、　土耳其之中立休矣、雖然、土耳其對此計劃殊少興趣、惟為友誼計、土總統　　　　　阿　　與邱吉爾會晤、而英土協定遂告成立、雙方並同意發表關於此次會議之聯合公報、英土協定所協定於土耳其之物質援助實無足重視、蓋在事實上德國亦以相當數量之戰　供給土耳其、德土間亦締有友好之協定、故英國報紙因阿達那會議而造成之樂觀態度、　無理由可　、至土耳其方面　持保留態度、報紙上所載之消息皆來自英方、故協約國是否將對土耳其加重其　力、已成目前最重要之問題、</p>
<h3>傳美國將接管　多米尼加海防</h3>

<h3>强有力的東條內閣　不重資望而拔擢新進　貫澈忘私奉公之精神　譯自一月號「企業」　（二）</h3>
<p>東條首相的出身</p>
<p>東條首相出生於岩手縣，父為有名的東條英敎中將，在前川上操六大將任參謀長時代，對於德國戰略理論的介紹，頗資倚重，惜不容於陸軍中的寺內正毅大將，以中　退役。祖父嘗為南部藩的樂師。岩手縣出生的尚有海軍米內光政大將，陸軍坂垣大將，及多田陸軍參謀次長等。東條首相也時往該縣出身者的「朝飯會」，其父英敎中將任小倉師團長時代首相出生，幼年時代在九州居住，所以與岩手縣的關係不深，不帶着東北地方人的調子。</p>
<p>他是陸軍士官學校第十二期生。比中國方面陸軍最高指揮官畑俊六大將早五期，他沒有當過師團長，中國事變勃發時，為東條兵團長，曾越滿洲國境而進出於內蒙，在戰史上曾下了京綏作戰的戰績，所以也有師團長的經騐。幷且在軍政軍令系統方面，累積了很豐富的經騐。中佐時代，任陸軍省副官，參謀本部部員，陸軍大學兵學敎官，整備局課長等職。大佐時代，曾任職隊長，參謀本部課長。少將時代。曾任軍事調查部長，旅團長，在軍事調查　長時代，政黨方面對於滿洲事變的批判，曾起引離間軍民的流言，他沒法屏息其事，一時　　　談。中　時代，歷任　東軍參謀長，陸軍次官，航空總監。與星　內　書　官長，在滿洲時即已　識。</p>
<p>任陸軍次官時，在昭和十三年，為坂垣陸　的次官。此時曾被稱為「剃刀次官」，發　其事務上的才能。東條首相把零星瑣事都仔細地加以筆錄，所以記憶力特强，從此時起，他的名譽，遂與偉大的軍政家梅津美治郎同時為人所稱道。</p>
<p>任次官僅半載，繼即轉任航空總監，當昭和十五年第二次近衛內閣組閣時，經前輩的提拔，任為陸相。受命之時，立即乘飛機參拜新任，繼即飛大阪向師團長訓示，其處事有如此者。自此他的生活頓形緊張，日無暇晷，午後十一時就寢，午前四時半起床，勵精圖治，獻身於國。</p>
<p>昭和十六年十月，繼第三次近衛內閣之後組閣，——自次　正十一年加　友三郎大將以　二十年　，首以　役軍人資格　　內閣，這現復　人內閣出現的原因，前遠　　　　首相第二次組閣在荻窪會談時　決定　統帥與政治一體化。第三次　近衛內閣時的　界情勢，幾　戰國時代同樣，在　國時代，秉政的當然是武將而非文官。也可以說是走向軍政內閣的必經過程。東條首相組閣時即兼任內相，即為此種準備。進入大東亞戰爭後國內情勢反見明朗化，為產生了更强固的團結，殊堪慶幸。東條首相的苦心孤詣，宵旰勤勞，以一身負國家安危，殊値得我們加以揄揚與愛戴。</p>
<p>鈴木總裁的政治力</p>
<p>東條內閣的最高幕僚，政治力的策動者，為與東條首相最知己的鈴木企劃院總裁，及星野書記官長。此二人之為閣僚，經騐豐富，學識淵博，且又手腕靈活，實為最完美的政治家。鈴木企劃院總裁是富有熱情者，星野書記官長曾任職滿洲，個性强靱，對於東條內閣的供獻很多，所以是東條首相最得用的幕僚。</p>
<p>鈴木企劃院總裁，當就任國務大臣時，嘗自述其懷說：「以白身而為大臣，嗣後唯有竭盡所能為國效勞，」他出生於千葉縣山武郡二川村山中的田舍，卒業於本鄕小學校，攻讀於私塾　芝町成蹊學舍二年，因求深造而進京，入京北中學，卒業後人士官學校為二十二　生，出校後曾駐屯中國歷任新聞班長，陸大敎官，內閣調查局調查官等，在　亞院總務長官柳川平助中將下任政務部長，頗受讚揚。</p>
<p>鈴木中一中將為一熱情的人，在中佐時代，任荒木陸相下的新聞班長，曾說：「推進國家和政治，僅需抱有赴湯蹈火在所不辭的精神者一二人已足，毋須很多的人。」</p>
<p>此後國內外情勢的演變，正符他的預言。他的政治哲學，成為行動的原理，而產生了上述的前進性。他的行動，如戰事般勇往直前，義無返顧。滿洲事變時，為新聞班長，排斥自由主義，創造高度國防這名詞，撞擊國家總力戰的警鐘，以喚起民衆。用歷史的眼光來看，他具有相當的天才。滿洲事變時，他為說服財政當局使籌措陸軍預算費，曾訪當時的高橋財相於其赤坂的私邸，與之暢論時局互數小時之久。用新聞班長的資格，來向藏相說明預算，他就是這樣獨斷獨行的人，其時高橋藏相曾氣憤地對他說：「君為步兵中佐，余為主計中佐。」在廣田內閣的調查局調查官任內，與奧村喜和男等聯合促使政府實行電力統制，這一種創作的原動力，也　自熱情中產生。</p>
<p>他自任企劃院總裁後，企劃院的政治力頓見强化，大東亞省的新　，各省行政的簡素化，當設計之任者亦為此企劃院的政治力，而表現於內閣的政治力實施上，一氣呵成，達到目的。企劃院策定一切。國家計劃，生產擴充及物資動員，都成為企劃院的職務，獲得關於重要國策預算的先決權，成為內閣中主要的部分，實有賴鈴木中將的大力。</p>
<p>興亞院的總務長官柳川中將轉任　相後，他即成為　實上的總務長官而指導興亞院。第二次近衛內閣時，以國務大臣兼企劃院總裁，於是辭去現役。柳川中將任陸軍次官時，鈴木中將當為中佐新聞班長，彼此本為舊　，在興亞院共事時柳川中將一切均信任付託。</p>
<p>他這倔强的獨尊的性格，曾有人評他鋒芒太露，稜角過屬。但現在的他與新聞班長及調查官時代，已大不大同了。歷練了多年的政治上的熏陶，業已大為成功了。</p>
<p>星野長官的强韌性</p>
<p>星野書記官長似較鈴木企劃院總裁更為年輕，靑年時代的朝氣與潑刺性，尚未失去。大阪時代，居於西宮，與妻曾為人拾球為業，他的破衣敝帽的風彩，至顯貴時仍維原狀。第二次近衛內閣時，被召至荻窪，他窗協和會服，用汚皺的手帕拭涕，大家見到他這落拓不覊，都為之一驚。</p>
<p>他生於上州沾田，父為耶穌敎牧師。成長於東京及橫濱，保有上州習氣的特性。至滿洲後，更助長此特性的風格，數年的苦鬥，他的性格頗為强韌。伉儷間由於至誠的結合，情愛彌篤，夫人甚賢又擅交際，在演壇上講演時，口若懸河，使聽衆出神。在滿洲時代很為活動，時出入於市公署，有滿洲宋美齡之稱。星野長官非其夫人親製之菜不下咽，所以夫人的生活雖很忙碌，仍須為其主人調製合口的菜肴，故為長官最好的內助。夫人與東條首相的　　為親戚，最近為避嫌起見，即公事上的交往亦漸趨减少了。</p>
<p>星野直　於昭和七年脫離大藏省至滿洲國。大藏省時代的星野，與同時的石渡莊太郎，入間野武雄諸氏，同被稱為大藏省三羽鳥。歷任主稅局經理課長，營繕管財局的國有財產課長等。昭和七年，至滿洲國任該國財政總的總務司長，經總務總次長而　轉總務長官。赴滿洲之任前，岳父臨終時激勵地說：「你將埋骨於滿洲，所以，現在不必過分悲慟」。他說了這話後，即踏上大陸的土地，他在滿洲時的活躍，果如他岳父的期望，星野繼大達茂雄氏之後，任總務應官長，總務廳的主持者任期往往無過一年，然他却作了四年有餘，悠然完成總務長官的任務，主持此困難的地位。</p>
<p>星野在滿洲國的經濟上很有成就。俗語有：「一手執敎典，一手執實劍」之說，星野則一面搗藥王道國家建設的大理想，一面在打着算盤。所以與軍人很合得攏，偶與傲强的軍人爭議時，常說，「請看數字，不是很淸楚嗎？」所以他為滿洲國打的算盤，實在可算是能手。</p>
<p>在滿洲國辛勤地工作了約十年，是中日滿亞太基主義（經濟集團主義）論者。日華滿高度國防體制的確立，在大東亞戰爭勃發前，對於日本的重要，毋庸於此贅述，星野經滿洲國第一次五年計劃後，對於中日滿經濟集團的實踐已有經騐，他親自體騐到其必要性與重大性。因有此經騐，所以第二次近衛內閣組閣時，起用星野為企劃院的總裁。</p>
<p>星野在第二次近衛內閣返國任企劃院總裁，後為無任所大臣，中途退職為貴族院議員，山酒井忠正伯的介紹加入研究會。這時候，他躭於　樂，東條首相組織戰時內閣時，對書記官長一職以力不勝任而謙辭。迨　職後，他發揮其固有的奇特性格與强韌性，成為東條內閣的台柱，深獲首相的依賴。</p>

<h3>英美焦慮反攻困難</h3>
<p>— 佐倉</p>
<p>新幾尼亞之餘痛猶悸　德潛艇襲擊難於應付</p>
<p>「里斯本特電廿四日佐倉特派員發」　蘇聯的反攻，與羅美爾軍的後退，與英國軍事評論家以約好的宣傳資料，而產生樂觀的論調。但尚有二個眞正的問題，應予考慮。其一，為潛艇的威脅，美國方面物的人的援助，於英國絕對必要，且此亦為勝負的關鍵，若沒有美國的援助，攻擊歐洲將為夢想。軸心國潛艇的活躍於全世界各海洋愈見潑刺，十六日改訂的羅特的戰時保險率、將功聯北部水域，與西地中海馬爾泰附近列為承保區域之外，可見此等海面被視為最危險的地點。自英國至美洲及菲洲西岸的大西洋航路保險率，增至百分之十，英國經好望角至澳洲百分之十五，英國至紅海，亞丁，蘇彝士，塞得港，亞歷山大利亞至馬爾泰百分之二十，英國經好望角紅海至叙利亞百分之十七，至土耳其百分之二十。</p>
<p>軍事評論家哈基在星期泰晤士報說：「潛水艦的新建，較擊沉的為數更多，不過英美方面所造船隻的喪失數之半，在本年度，輸送力不克消化攻擊力」。愛麥納爾在每日快報上說：「德國潛水艇據海相說有五百隻，實際恐不止此數，開戰以來英美方面的損失，超過一九三五年時英國的總噸數，美國即使建造了很多的船隻，假如沒有速力快而有防禦力的貨船，護送軍艦與護衛飛機，則造船計劃終將失望」。</p>
<p>專家們雖有種種潛水艦的對策，但不外轟炸潛水艦工廠，海空軍護航與建造速力快的貨船三者，因為都不能收得絕對的效果，所以不能決定究應置其重點於何策。轟炸工塲的結果，並未如政府所宣傳的减少了潛水艦的生產。要之，沒有妥善的解決方策，此次大戰中潛水艦戰術所與的威脅，遠較上次大戰為烈。</p>
<p>另一問題，由於新幾尼亞的陸戰更痛感到對日作戰的因難。泰晤士報現地特派員報道，　稱日軍的强盛，不畏死，難於攻擊，而於十四日的該報社評上主張：不能採用各個擊破政策，而應首先傾全力擊破日本。社評中主張：「海力依存於空力，空力則依存於陸力。假使在中國開闢陸上飛機塲施行大規模的空襲，則日本將立即用陸軍加以佔領。故此時與日本作戰，應置强有力的陸軍於緬甸及太平洋，空軍自緬甸出擊，以攻擊太平洋的輸送船」。兩種報紙同時都反對以洲為第一戰塲，東洋為第二戰塲，而警告先破德國，後攻日本的一般作戰論，輕視日本的差誤。由於去年新幾尼亞之戰的經騐，莫大的軍艦與人命的損失，給與重大警告，為擊破日本，此後不應再繼續這種戰爭，而主張奪回東孟加拉灣，重開緬甸路綫援助渝軍，以攻擊日本。十七日星期泰晤士報說：</p>
<p>「這是最正確的議論，我們與日本隔離過遠，故不能明瞭日本。能攻擊日本者，唯蘇聯，但蘇聯尚未加入與日本的戰事，攻勢論最大的障礙，為潛艇與日軍，而此亦即為軸心方面的企圖」。　（翔：譯自一月二十七日東京每日新聞（</p>

<h3>請市區改善計口授糧</h3>
<p>— 三之</p>
<p>按租界當局之計口授糧，以十日爲一期，令各米店發售，從未愆期，而亦未嘗聞在同一期計口授糧中各米店所授之米質及價格有參差。迴顧市區之計口授糧，則逈然不同，從未能按期分派，一延再延而一月三期全延得影踪全無，而同一期約計口授糧中常有價格不同及米質不一之分。筆者爲居於南市之一市民，對於身歷其境的南市方面計口授糧，知之甚詳，願詳述之，俾各關當局可知其大概，並懇市糧管局體恤民情而改善。</p>
<p>南市計口授糧，最初一二個月，實爲計戶授糧，不以口爲單位，而以戶爲單位，每戶每期米一斗，並不定期。至去年十月，始實行計口授糧，然十月中應得三期授糧，直至十一月終了始發元。而數量亦由每期每人白米二升降爲每期每人碎米一升五合，中間一期曾配搭每人麵粉一斤。十一月份授糧乃脫期至十二月初旬始發售，計糙米每人一升四合（又少了一合米），並補給十月份第二期中所缺的每人半斤麵粉；其後又在十二月二十五日發售十一月份的第二期，計白，碎米共一升四合。十一月份第三期直至本年一月七日始配給計白米一升四合，麵粉一斤半。其後，更換米票，由是十二月份却無形取消，而所領得的米票，爲三十二年度一月份的米，麵三聯票。第一聯米票在一月二十日領得糙米每人二升；（按第一，二坊所發的戶口米爲每人白米一升六合，碎米四合，計五元，而筆者所居第三坊却純爲糙米，而售價反貴一角，爲每人五元一角。）第二聯米栗在三十日發配每人白米一升八合，（較之前期每人又少了二合米）售四元六角。至二月二日猶未聞第三期發配消息，而三聯麵粉票至今仍未發給。本來，戶口米尙不足維持個人最低需要，今市區較之兩租界當局所授配的，在數量方面旣相差甚多，而又無麵粉搭配，且常一再延期而取消不發。是故凡我百萬市區無辜莫不皆延頸長望，冀我市區當局亟亟改善之以濟我百萬嗷嗷待哺之衆生，想我賢明之市區當局必能體念衆情，有所表示，至少，對於筆者下列各點當能在最短期內切實施之於實際。</p>
<p>（一）確定授糧日期。（二）每期配搭麵粉，（三）米質米價數量各區一律。（四）着令各米店不准故意留難。</p>
<p>其二　賀藍</p>
<p>貴報對於糧食問題的大聲疾呼，顯然已收了相常的效果。戶口米，戶口粉的配給量，不是已在逐期增加了嗎？雖然現在的口糧，還不能滿足全部的需要，可是糧食問題的嚴重性，已隨着配給量的增多而遂漸降低了。但這是指兩租界而說的。至於我們滬四區，糧食問題，依然十分嚴重。同時糧政當局，似乎直到現在，每人買到百米一升五合，糙米六合，碎米七合，麵粉一斤半。今天購米證總算發下來了，但每人只准購買白米七合，糙米一升一合，碎米二合。合計起來，本月份每人一總買到白米二升二合，糙米一升七合，碎米九合和麵粉一斤半。試問這一些糧食足够一個人幾天的消費呢！這問題在平日已够嚴重了，而况現在當局已頒布禁令，不准糧食自由入境，這問題自然是愈益尖銳化了。滬西區雖然也不乏富有之家，但是隱貧和赤貧階級畢竟佔多數，不，畢竟佔大多數。我每月有一千幾百元的收入，而且我所服務的機關准許我每月購買特種配給米一斗三升半，可是最近幾個月以來，沒有一個月不是入不敷出，以致舉債，以致典質的。我檢貢一下帳目，發覺到大部分的錢都化在糧食的補充上面。現在黑市米又貴了，而且不容易買到了。如果糧食的配給量不能增的的話，那我簡直不能生活下去了。我想滬西區的居民，和我同樣情形，或者情况比我更壞的，一定還多着。他們所受糧食問題的威脅，自然也可想而知了。筆者代表滬西區一百五十萬居民，殷切的希望滬西糧政當局，能體念民食的艱難，迅速做到以下兩點：</p>
<p>（一）月內再發售米每口一升二合，粉每口四斤二兩，如此連前所發，恰等於一月內兩租界所配給的數量。</p>
<p>（二）從二月份起，每月分配的辦法和次數，及每次分配的數量，完全和兩租界一機。</p>
<p>我相信兩租界當局所能辦到的，滬西糧政當局一定也能辦到。我更相信，滬西糧政黨局，維持民食的苦心，一定也不减兩租界當局的。筆者謹在此致其喁喁之望！</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>自一月十三日實施糧政嚴格統制後，市上小販米商，幾至絕跡，各米肆麵肆，均無貨應市。市民渴望戶口米，又復不能按照如租界之每期配給，傳說增加口糧，而市區最近一期，反爲减少。一月份第一期戶口米，在廿一日始發給每口二升，第二期廿九日發給每口一升八合均無麵粉。第三期尙　消息，據按照租界之口糧，尙祗够五天之需，而市區如本月份兩期，每口僅領到三升八合，使人如何度飽。當局實施嚴格統制，原爲抑平黑市，普益民生起見，然如彈性之黑市愈加　低，而彈力愈高。（陳傑）</p>
<h3>收買蔴袋暫展期　逾期處罰沒收　日大使館事務所發表談話</h3>
<p>駐滬日本大使館事務所以際此農產物上市最盛時期、爲確保包裝農產物用之蔴袋起見、前曾商山市政府、工部局、暨公董局、收買市上所存蔴袋、惟收買時間極短、當局收買之旨趣、猶爲一般人士所未會澈底明瞭、故不得已將收買期間延長至二月十三日截止、切望市民予以協力、如有再誤日期、未出售予當局者、則一律予以沒收、並對所有者從嚴處罰、日大使館事務所頃就此事特發表談話如次、「本大使館事務所前商由市政府工部局公董局等三機關、實施收買市上所存蔴袋、此已如市民諸位所明瞭者、邇來收買之成績極形順利、然以收買期間極暫、且使市民周知之方法未見澈底、致未能充分了解此項計劃之詳細情形者、爲數諒在不少、故各市政機關決定將期限延期至二月十三日截止、於此延長期間內、收買辦法與前同樣、　不採取强制手段、切望市民自動協力、如在此期間未能達到預期目的時、則市政三機關其後再發現蔴袋類、不問其情形如何、決採取沒收等强制手段、深願市民了解此次收買計劃、於復興上海重建華中上必獲致重大成果、希望各自率先協力當局、以免受非出當局本意、目對各位市民亦極不名譽之强制措置云、</p>
<h3>婦女福利協會　徵求會員</h3>
<p>本市婦女福利協會、自於上月二十九日成立以來、對會務之推進、不遺餘力、茲爲擴大組織起見、特於一日起登報、開始公開徵求會員、歡迎各界智識婦女熱烈參加、聞手續甚爲間單、該會會址在靜安寺路幕爾鳴路口九七二弄九八四號、報名時間爲每星期一至星期五下午二時至五時逾時不候云、</p>
<h3>中央儲備銀行　將遷新址辦公</h3>
<p>中國銀行於八一三事變以前、在外灘開工興建新屋、旋因事變發生、工程中輟、嗣由中央儲備銀　鳩工將該新屋賡續建造、現已完竣、故中央儲備銀行近將遷入該新屋辦公、</p>
<h3>各業零售捐　不得免收　購物不論多少　一律須開發票</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局曁法租界公董局規定各公司商號於零售貨物時徵收零售捐百分之二、自開始以還、成績卓著、茲悉當局以最近有若干商店不時或有免收是項零售捐款、殊爲違背法令、故特員隨時偵査、凡任何商人出售貨物、如確係零售者、均須依法徵收零售捐、不得自由蠲免、否則一經査覺、決依法嚴懲不貸、同時各零售商出售物品不論多寡、均須開給發票、以便當局査閱出售物品數額與已徵收之零售捐是否相符、</p>
<h3>銀錢業總結束期　收票營業時間照舊　舊曆年關已迫工作緊張</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業所屬各銀行錢莊、對於舊曆年底總結束手續、以期限已迫、俱特別繁忙、一切票據交換，客戶款項收解·同業拆放數字、雖無法覓得確切數額、然已較上週間又增至一倍以上、各行莊及銀聯會·票據交換所·錢業準備庫·錢業市塲等方面曾計工作、已經非常緊張、辦公時間、似已多予延長、行莊集中區域內、各行莊收賬解款人員、往來頻繁、記者昨向金融界方面探悉、關於錢業同業、總結束之收票時間、因上次該公會舉行執行委員會議時、曾決定俟與銀聯會商洽後再行通吿遵照、現錢業經派員與銀聯會商妥、該兩業同業收票時間、已決定照舊不改、其時間至下午四時爲止、對外營業及辦公時間曁其退票時間、亦均決定不改、聞錢業洋拆昨日已低爲一角四分云、</p>
<h3>岡崎參事官專程來滬　促進經濟施策　對各機關傳遞大東亞省之意向　將與中日經濟巨擘協商各問題</h3>
<p>大東亞省參事官岡崎嘉太平氏、爲促進國府參戰　之在華經濟施策對駐華各機關傳遞大東亞省之意向、並與關係方面協商要公起見、取道華北來滬、業已於一日抵埠、下榻白老滙大厦、岡崎氏當日即在大使館上海事務所會晤奧田經濟部長、有所協議、並　與中日經濟巨擘協商各項經濟問題云、</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>租界增加戶口米</h3>
<p>增加戶口米配合數量，已為全市人民一致之要求。以往本報之獻議，市民之呼籲，至再至三。當局對此問題，亦表示深切關心。先於一月十三日頒令禁止糧食自由移運，以期統一收購內地糧食，運滬配給，今又決定增加戶口米之數量，自每人每月四八公斤，增至六公斤，（即由六升增至七升半）的增四分之一。增加之數量，　尙未能滿足需要，但足證當局能重視與論，採納民意。吾人於此，一方面固信賴當局必能繼續設法，儘早增至每人最　　要數量；一方面感謝當局關心民瘼之意。同時，租界方面，旣決定增加，市區方面，亦盼糧食當局儘速籌劃，本報迭據市區讀者報吿（參閱本日本報讀者論壇），配給數量，旣較租界爲少，而發給日期，又不準確，亟盼注意改善。</p>
<h3>中儲行遷移新址</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行，不日將遷入前中國銀行新址辦公。八一三前，中國銀行在仁記路外灘興建巨厦，旋因事變，工程中輟。迨大東亞戰爭發生後，該屋即視作敵產，被日軍管理，今則交還國府，指由中儲行使用。日本當局此舉，旨在協助中央儲備銀行之發展，則今後該行將如何善爲經營，以期鞏同金融，健全戰時經濟，而完成國家銀行之使命，吾人不勝翹首以望。</p>

<h3>夫子自道　生與死的邊涯</h3>
<p>— 荊苓</p>
<p>妻的腹部漸漸隆突起來，我的眼眶慢慢的凹下去，我的憂戚妻是了解的，她也終日唉聲嘆氣；生活是如此逼人，人生是多難的，小生命蟄伏在肚中，就安排好了悲劇底命運。</p>
<p>月入薪水難以敷衍我和妻的生活，住着鴿籠樣的擱樓，吃着湯水般的稀粥，穿的是千創百孔的舊衣，我常常對妻懺悔，我覺得對不起她，流淚眼常常凝視在一起，我說目已太荏弱了，可是她也埋怨着自己的無能，不能爲我分担這小家庭的担子。</p>
<p>寅吃卯糧成了日常功課，當舖成了熟相知，西北風不斷地刮着，寒刺使我牙關戰個不停，薄夾袍尙臨風招展…</p>
<p>妻見了我挾着書和卷子回家，不斷戰慄的樣子，眼睛又流漾着淚光。</p>
<p>第二天，妻乘我上校敎書的當兒，將她自己僅有的棉袍去當了，又贖回了我的棉袍，不够的錢向後樓嫂嫂借的：等我回來，我見她換穿夾袍和罩衫，心裏就起着疑惑，我酸鼻默默然，她已拿了棉袍要我穿上。</p>
<p>等到她替我穿上，有些暖上身來，她安慰着替我拭淚，碰着冰冷的手指，我的淚水更湧出來了。</p>
<p>軋油隊伍長蛇　樣佈滿了街頭，無情的鞭子落在人頭上，一陣嘶叫，隊伍起了大的騷動，生命的延續多困難啊！我想低着頭不看眼前的現實，可是一種莫名的感慨啃嚙着我的心。</p>
<p>步進擱樓，扭亮電燈，預備改些文卷，讀着孩子們天眞純潔的語句，完美的理想，美麗得住在天堂一樣，他們沒有齷齪和苦難。</p>
<p>思緒剛飛越了十年，一步步沉重而緩慢的扶梯聲，喚醒了我的回憶，我還祇在人生道上走了二十七個年頭，過往的快樂好像已經是數十年前的事情。</p>
<p>現存眼前是妻的蓬髮下面二顆烏亮而乏神的眼瞳，提着空瓶兒往床邊一放，一手按着腹往床上上倒，囁嚅着說：</p>
<p>「苓！我有些痛…」</p>
<p>我呆了，還祇八個月呢，要我如何應付得及，我呆若木鷄，妻拉我一下。……</p>
<p>二個沒有經騐的人凝思在一起，看看妻的臉色，我數數袋中的鈔票，拼凑起來不滿十元錢，一邊把妻扶睡得正些，連忙奔下樓去向學校奔…</p>
<p>走進校長室，校長正在看報，從二塊眼鏡玻璃上斜視着我，不勝其詫異似的，覺得我來得突兀，我　開口又縮回來，我記得自己已經預支了二個月薪水，終於冒着絕大的勇氣我開口了：</p>
<p>「校長，我的女人將要生產，請你准我借二個月薪水。」</p>
<p>「你不是已預支二月了呢？學校經濟情形我想你一定很詳細，生煙　度日漲夜大，你已經是例外了，預支二個月，現在…」</p>
<p>「我出來時，她已經肚痛得利害，請你格外幫忙，因爲我實在急…」</p>
<p>他見我急得如此，反而很間散似的把鉛筆往杯子上噹噹敲幾下，我忍不住光火了，回轉頭往外直跑，他在背後冷笑說：</p>
<p>「嘻…生孩子可不是容易的…」</p>
<p>我聽了不跟他計較，磁着門房阿王，說明了我的急事，他倒慷慨地借給我二十元錢，我向家中直跑得飛似的。</p>
<p>奔上　樓，妻痛得格外利害，後樓嫂嫂提着油瓶見了我劈口就說：</p>
<p>「先生，師母軋油軋傷了，你不該讓她去軋的，她肚于道末大，你們男人家就不照管女人，就像我家那個也是道樣。」她指手劃脚打起醫喻，責備男人，我祇得對妻說：</p>
<p>「我想先請個醫牛來看看吧！」</p>
<p>妻痛得利害，不響，我毫不思索地出了門，向鄰家借打了電話給產科醫院。</p>
<p>醫生來了，妻痛得大聲嘶叫，醫生診察以後，醫生叫我預備熱水，我望望妻，祇得提了熱瓶去泡開水，老虎灶回來，門已關上了，我聽得妻的呻吟，又聽見低而尖的聲音，我知道小生命已經到臨了苦難的人間…</p>
<p>中午，回家走進擱樓，妻正給孩子吮奶，孩子細小得很，二個小眼倒烏亮的，拚命地啃着奶頭，奶水的稀少更增加了做母親的痛苦，妻愁眉苦臉的瞅着這小東西，我憐憫地去吻他，妻怕惹他哭，推開我。我問妻：</p>
<p>「奶糕可以讓他吃些嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想自己吃喝得多些，奶水會多的！」我覺得做母親的一股愛和熱，流暖了我的臓腑。</p>
<p>提起米罐子去燒粥，米又不够一頓粥，偷偷拿去煮了，讓妻多吃些，我自己祇喝半碗粥湯，妻問我飽不飽，我說飽了。</p>
<p>有些朋友慷慨的替我想法子，找到錢就買米和菜給妻吃：妻是好潔的，後樓嫂嫂常常替她洗些穢衣，然而她的孩子很多，妻過意不去，瞞着我偷偷自己去洗。</p>
<p>一次，二次，受了寒，病了，熱度又高，後樓嫂嫂見了我，警吿我說：</p>
<p>「先生！嫂嫂發熱是不行的，當心！」</p>
<p>我拚命向人借錢，請醫生診察，可是，醫生藥費好像富人的專有品，我們沒有份兒，天哪！生與死的距離究竟有多闊啊！（移酬作助學金）</p>

<p>故事寫杉山文夫聽了他母親的話，奉第一代祖先杉山大作爲楷模，一心一意想把祖先的遭遇重視於今日。但是，過去是過去，現在怎麽能重現那樣的事呢？於是他堂，吉訶德式地受了許多奚落和嘲笑。但是，傻子自有傻運，居然絕處逢生，處處得了便宜，而且終於贏得了物產公司經理女兒的靑睞，一同出發到滿洲去，作了視察旅行。</p>
<p>如上所述，故事是相當有風趣的。倘能加重過去和現在的對照，在這中間掘發許多笑料，然後加入一段羅曼史，一邊寫衆人對杉山文夫的嘲笑，一邊寫經理女兒宏美對他的推誠相愛，……這樣，能成爲一齣諷刺性的笑劇，那是一定的。然而，看了「憨漢艷史」，我覺得編劇和導演都辜負了這樣的好題材。</p>
<p>在電影藝術中，鏡頭剪接間的「速率」和「一貫性」，是第一要注意的。美國片在內容意識方面，先不要去管它；至少，他們對情緒的把握，是非常注意的。就是說，他們很能懂得截長補短，刪繁就簡的訣竅，用跳躍式的鏡頭，從頭至尾緊緊地扣住觀衆的心絃。這樣，就往往使得不慣看電影的老太太們如墮五里霧中，覺得莫明其妙，但更重要的却是，充分發揮了近代電影藝術的特性。</p>
<p>「戇漢艷史」在這些點上，是不大足够了的。綜計在此片中，交戰塲面不下四五次之多，每次時間延長不下七八分鐘之久，這樣，一半的膠片就被佔去了。在舊小說中，張飛見了馬超，一個回合二個回合打去，作者可以跟着也一個回合二個回合地描寫。但在電影中，這是完全不必要的。</p>
<p>相反，有些地方，却又叫人覺得太匆促。恐怕因爲不必要的描寫被佔去太多的原故吧，許多鏡頭只能看見一些人影在蠕動，一個人出去了，一個人進來了，如走馬燈一般，任憑導演在支配劇情而已。等到劇情表過，電影也就完了。但是，滑稽片的特長決不在叙述劇情。它應該用許多具體的行爲，口吻，事跡……造成笑料，來打動觀衆。</p>
<p>還有，故事旣以古代和近代相對比，那麽，顯然的，古代部分應該佔的少，而讓近代部分佔的比較地多，並使二者有機地聯繫在一起。本片雖也注意到這一點，但古代部分，我以爲仍可以大刪而特刪。相反，杉山文夫和宏美戀愛的鏡頭倒應該加多。（片中宏美簡直沒有戲）。</p>
<p>還有一點小疵，就是後來做夢捉賊的一節，做夢容易叫人疑爲實有其事。導演對夢境和現實，似乎不曾有分別不同的處理。</p>
<p>總之，「憨漢艷史」是一部値得一看的作品。但認眞批評起來，仍有許多濃淡不均，凸凹不平之處，應請導演先生予以注意。</p>

<p>以上道一切，都在抗議與憤怒的一霎時間，掠過了他的心頭，不過他沒有說出其中的一個字。他只整整他那破碎的長袍，『呃哼—呃哼』地走開了幾步。他辯論得已鏗够了。在門口，他回過頭來說：『我不—呃哼—想辭職—你對於這事—呃哼—你要怎麽辦便怎麽辦！』</p>

<h3>Strengthening Controls Through Comprehensive Price Freezes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's news reported that various industry associations were rigorously evaluating and setting standard price limits for goods, with the aim of thoroughly stabilizing the market and curbing the prices of various commodities on a large scale. This matter is of great importance to the lives of citizens and is not only necessary for Shanghai but should also be earnestly implemented in other regions. This newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions regarding the issue of commodity prices, and we have always believed that it is closely related to the government's overall economic policy and is also part of the overall political problem. If the political problem is resolved and the overall economic policy is sound, then the commodity price problem can be easily solved. Similarly, if the commodity price problem is resolved satisfactorily, then general social problems can also be resolved satisfactorily, and all the government's policies can be smoothly implemented. Therefore, today when we talk about price limits, fair prices, and stabilizing the market, we must first demand effective political solutions and the implementation of comprehensive economic policies, especially since our country has already joined the war, making this demand even more urgent.</p>
<p>The main and fundamental solution to the commodity price problem is to implement a policy of monetary tightening, properly guide idle capital into production, and implement organized and planned production increases. These are positive measures to stabilize the market and society. This newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions on this aspect, and I will not repeat them today. However, with positive efforts, negative controls are still needed to complement each other for greater effectiveness. Therefore, I would like to offer my views on strengthening controls and comprehensive price freezes as a reference for those studying the commodity price problem and managing price controls today, and I naturally hope that the authorities and the economic community will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>In the past, the authorities had already studied the commodity price problem and had decided and implemented many countermeasures, and it seemed to have achieved considerable success within a certain period. However, judging from the facts in various places, it is still far from the ideal effect of commodity price control. Currently, from the government to the common people, they are still constantly affected by the adverse effects of the commodity price problem. The reason for this is that all controls are biased towards being partial or regional. The so-called partial nature is that the scope of control is limited, only controlling certain commodities or only controlling a certain part of the production and sales process of certain commodities, lacking a comprehensive and thorough plan. The so-called regional nature means that past controls were either limited to certain cities or regions, or those subject to control in area A could be free in area B, or those restricted in area B were let loose in area A; even if both areas A and B were subject to control, the laws, organizations, institutions, and methods of control were either uneven, or slightly different in strictness, or mutually restrictive. It is naturally a big question whether this can actually be effective. In the future, the government should widely adopt public opinion from the people, absorb experts from all walks of life, and conduct thorough research with relevant government agencies to determine appropriate and comprehensive countermeasures and implement comprehensive control through cooperation between officials and the people. Here, it is also necessary to note: (1) Not only must the government closely cooperate with the people, but it must also take into account and advance simultaneously with other political, economic, and social policies. The so-called comprehensive control cannot be handled solely by commodity price controllers, but must be done in close cooperation with all departments and institutions of politics, economy, and society to be effective. (2) The so-called comprehensive control is not a horizontal control without distinction. It should be based on the different causes and varying degrees of commodity price problems in each province and city, and take different measures as much as possible; it should also be based on the different types, characteristics, uses, values, and special circumstances of production and sales of different commodities, and take different measures as much as possible; there is a need to properly distinguish between urgency, leniency, and strictness. (3) The control institutions must be unified, the powers and responsibilities must be clear, the personnel must be well-organized, and the personnel at all levels who implement control must not only undergo serious training, but also undergo strict assessment at any time. The supervision of civil society and the respect of public opinion are indispensable key points. We believe that only after such comprehensive control is implemented, coupled with political improvement and the implementation of wartime economic policies, can a reasonable solution to the commodity price problem be expected.</p>
<p>Regarding price limits, almost all countries have implemented them during this extraordinary period. Not only have all the warring countries long implemented strict price limit systems for goods, but even the neutral countries have adapted to the needs of the environment and implemented price limits. Our country has long implemented them in some areas, especially in this city. However, in the past, due to various reasons, the expected results were not achieved. Therefore, we will not talk about price limits today; otherwise, first, we must implement comprehensive price limits, rather than merely partial price limits. If only a very small number of goods are designated for price limits, while their raw materials, wages, transportation, and general related production costs continue to rise, then the price limits will inevitably be unfair. If they are consumer goods, the market will be suffocated and the source will be cut off; if they are production goods, it will inevitably hinder production and reduce resources. Also, if price limits only apply to certain specific areas, it will inevitably create rapid price increases and cause new panic in the supply chain of materials. Therefore, today we must impose universal restrictions on the prices of most commodities, transportation costs, and wages across the country.</p>
<p>Second, price limits must be based on objective facts and should not be too idealistic or too principled. In general theory, there are so-called "cost price," "production cost price," "standard price," "composite price," etc., but they must all be based on facts. If the stipulated price does not match the cost or production costs, then the government must implement the necessary supply system. It is also unreasonable to only limit production prices while general commerce is not controlled, or control is looser. Therefore, price limits must be enforced in the fields of commerce, production, transportation, and power, and public utilities should set an example first.</p>
<p>Of course, comprehensive price limits must be implemented in parallel with comprehensive controls. Price limits are the work of all fair price measures, but they cannot be separated from other fair price work, so comprehensive price limits can only be achieved under comprehensive control.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to emphasize that in order to implement the policy of stabilizing commodity prices and securing society, we must combine passive controls and price limits with active production increases in order to achieve practical results, especially in striving to increase production, conserve consumption, and facilitate transportation, so as to balance supply and demand. And how to control finance, adjust tax laws, and tighten budgets to reduce the issuance of currency and recover surplus purchasing power; and how to strictly organize society so that the people assist the government in implementing economic inspections, and strengthen industry associations, cooperatives, etc., to strengthen production and assist in distribution, and then have the government control materials and restrict price increases, are all important points that those who talk about control and price limits today must not ignore. We hope that the economy and politics will go hand in hand, eliminating the ills of past biases and imbalances, so that the ideal of control will be realized.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Italy Abandons Tripoli and the Situation of the War</h3>
<p>The German-Italian allied forces in North Africa have finally abandoned Italian-controlled Tripoli. In addition to the loss of El Agheila last autumn, Italy has temporarily abandoned Libya. This is a major event in history. Italy took over Libya after the war with Turkey more than 20 years ago, making it a base for Italy's overseas development. However, gains and losses are common in war, especially desert warfare in North Africa, which may turn misfortune into good fortune due to the battle of Tunisia. Moreover, when the war ends and the Axis powers are destined to win, the lost territories can be recovered. Italian Minister of National Culture Propaganda, Pavolini, encouraged the people in a radio speech, hoping to pay attention to the new situation in Tunisia, and said: "The determination to win is the greatest weapon," and "The recovery of Libya is just around the corner." We express our sympathy for what Pavolini said.</p>
<p>As for the current situation in North Africa, since Rommel's line of defense in Egypt was breached, although the British Eighth Army has driven straight to Tripoli, the British army's momentum is not sharp, so the Axis forces can still assist General Arnim, who landed in Tunisia. Although Tripoli has fallen today, if General Rommel can contact General Arnim and fight side by side, and the terrain of Tunisia is suitable for defense, then Tunisia, the only barrier for the Axis in North Africa, is still in the hands of the Axis powers, and the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States will not be easily successful. At present, the Axis forces in North Africa are pouring all their efforts into the greatest struggle. After General Rommel transferred his position, he has achieved local success in geography, which is enough to maintain the strength of the mechanized troops. We can see the geographical importance of the war in Tunisia. The issue is not only about the territory of Africa, but also about the control of the sea and air in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is one of the important locations for the United Kingdom and the United States to fight the world. From Cape Bon in northeastern Tunisia to Marsala in Sicily, the straight line is only 144 nautical miles. For the sake of defending Italy itself, the new battle situation has a great relationship with Italy. (Transcribed by Ren: from the Asahi Shimbun on January 26)</p>
<h3>Solomon Islands Area: Japanese Air Raids on US Positions; German Newspaper Praises the Victory at Rennell</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to the US Navy Department's announcement yesterday, Japanese aircraft again attacked Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on the 29th of last month. However, the state of public morale has not been announced.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy Department released a battle report on the 1st, stating that Japanese air units bombed US military positions in the Solomon Islands area on the 29th.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: On the 1st, Berlin's evening newspapers published the battle situation of the sea battle of Rennell, as announced by the Japanese headquarters and reported to the parliament by the Japanese Minister of the Navy, Shimada, on the front page. The Deutsche Nachrichten newspaper even carried a lengthy telegram from Tokyo correspondent Schulte, praising the unprecedented victory of the Japanese naval air force.</p>
<p>Stockholm, February 2nd, Central News Agency: On the 1st, Swedish evening newspapers all published the results of the Japanese Navy's sea battle at Rennell Island in a prominent position with large headlines. Since the Karlstad talks, the Swedish people have been misled by anti-Axis propaganda regarding the war situation on the Eastern Front and elsewhere. Therefore, when the news of the Japanese Navy's outstanding achievements in this battle came, they were surprised.</p>
<p>Istanbul, February 2nd, Central News Agency: After the news of the sea battle of Rennell Island, as announced by the Japanese headquarters, was transmitted here, it was broadcast by the Tokyo Broadcasting Station.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to Washington sources, the US Navy Department today refused to comment on the recent announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters regarding the sinking or damaging of seven Allied warships by Japanese aircraft in the sea battle off Rennell Island.</p>
<p>Spokesman for Japanese Information Bureau Comments on Recent Victories</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Mr. Hori, spokesman for the Information Bureau, recently commented on Japan's recent victories in the South Pacific, saying that the decisive victory won by the Imperial Navy Air Force in the battle off Rennell Island was the first strong response from Japan to the boasts of the United Kingdom and the United States after the Casablanca Conference about a major offensive in 1943. When the Casablanca Conference was announced, it was extravagantly promised to the world that a major offensive would be launched in 1943. However, within a week, the Allied powers received their first response. On January 29th and 30th, our Imperial Navy Air Force achieved outstanding results in the battle off Rennell Island, which shattered the extravagant hopes of the British and American camps and once again proved that the enemy's attempt to break into the vast area controlled by Japan was in vain. US Secretary of the Navy Knox, after inspecting the Pacific war zone, declared to the press in Honolulu with fanfare, "The preparation period is over. We have just begun to fight. We are ready to strike hard and will continue to strike hard. The loss of ships is a matter of great concern to Japan." This is quite interesting. When the US Secretary of the Navy made this extravagant statement, his fleet seemed to have encountered the most tragic disaster, suffering an extremely fierce blow, or perhaps he was unable to report this bad news. In any case, Knox probably wants to shut up now. Or Knox should not forget who is the one who "strikes hard" and who is truly concerned about the loss of ships. Up to now, the American radio stations are still saying that there is no news from the Solomon Islands area, so it is expected that the Allied powers will still be unaware of this major setback for some time to come (two battleships and three cruisers sunk, one battleship and one cruiser damaged, and three fighter planes shot down). It is their practice for the United States to delay announcing war losses. Although officers like Knox are optimistic, British and American people now admit that even the most distant outposts of Japan cannot be slightly penetrated by the Allied powers. Although inspections are strict, the truth cannot be concealed. For example, British military commentator Forbes wrote in the "London Illustrated News" that "the hope of the Allied forces recovering the areas occupied by Japan is very slim," and said that "Australia and the United States have no victories in New Guinea." The Times magazine also said that although the Allied powers are working hard, "there is no progress in the Pacific war." The rapidly deteriorating position of the United States in the Pacific has caused extreme anxiety in the so-called Allied camp and a growing sense of the bitterness of defeat. The Australian people are quite shocked by the unfavorable war situation approaching their coast. Australian Prime Minister Curtin has repeatedly appealed to the United States for more assistance, and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt also said to the Australian people a day or two ago, "Australia needs more American assistance to meet the legitimate needs of the overall strategy in the Southwest Pacific." When Evatt made this statement, he obviously did not know about the tragic defeat of the US Navy. Regardless of Knox's extravagant statements or the promises of the Casablanca Conference, the Australian people have to obey the facts, that is, even if the assistance they need continues to arrive, it will only be a small amount. As for Chongqing, it is said that it is quite disappointed with the Casablanca Conference. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing said, "Unless American supplies, convenient transportation, and other necessities are transported overland through Burma, the Chinese army will not launch an offensive. It is generally believed here that the importance of reopening the Burma Road to China is being underestimated everywhere." Chongqing's neglect is like that of Australia. Other "Allied" countries who want American assistance are no different. The supplies from the self-proclaimed "arsenal of democracy" will not arrive, and the Casablanca Conference has proven to be a desert mirage composed of new promises and guarantees, just like the previous meetings between Roosevelt and Churchill, with no substance at all, only dazzling fools.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Explains War Aims: Defeat the Enemy by Various Means, But No Intention of Dominating the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Prime Minister Tojo said in response to questions from members of the General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives today that the Japanese Empire is determined to use various methods to defeat the enemy's combat power, but Japan has no intention of dominating the world. Japan's true intention is to establish co-existence and co-prosperity among all countries. In order to realize this intention, Japan must inflict a severe blow on the United Kingdom and the United States, complete Japan's self-preservation and self-defense, and restore the freedom and prosperity of Greater East Asia. One year after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has become a "state with resources," and its resources have exceeded those of the United Kingdom and the United States, and its combat power has also increased rapidly. On the contrary, the United Kingdom and the United States are struggling under the heavy burden of increasing difficulties. In terms of materials, Japan has occupied the vast resources of the Southern Region, which has laid the foundation for certain victory. Furthermore, the countries of East Asia have all awakened and are cooperating closely with us. The allied countries of the United Kingdom and the United States are gradually expanding their military lines around the world, so the anti-Axis countries all feel that replenishment is difficult. At this critical moment, the United States has lost its important war materials such as rubber and tin, so it cannot increase the production of war equipment to make up for the huge consumption of the current war. Taking aircraft as an example, the United States now has to manufacture wooden aircraft due to the lack of aluminum. This is only one aspect of the critical shortage of important war materials in the United States. In terms of morale, the American people value individualism and lack true traditional spirit. The American national defense mechanism is fragile, while Japan has a national unity mechanism. The people have a fervent determination to fight to the end until victory is achieved. The United Kingdom and the United States' extravagant plans for a new world after the war are merely to conceal their defeat and deceive the people of their own countries and neutral countries. Japan is not like that. It clarified its war aims in the imperial rescript declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, so that all countries can get what they deserve. Japan is always making its greatest efforts for the co-prosperity of all countries in the world. Therefore, Japan's actions are fundamentally different from the ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States to control the world for centuries. In order to eliminate this ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States, Japan took up arms on December 8, 1941. Today, the development of the war is beneficial to us and is getting closer and closer to the goal. The abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions in China, as well as granting independence to Burma within this year, are the prelude to Japan's complete realization of its lofty goals. The Prime Minister finally said that although Japan is pouring all its efforts into fighting the United States and the United Kingdom, it has no intention of occupying American territory. It is useless for Japan to occupy any part of the United States or South America.</p>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo answered questions from member Nakajima Mitani at the general meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the morning of the 2nd regarding fundamental issues of strengthening combat power, and explained his determination to handle state affairs, roughly saying, "I believe that the harmony between command and state affairs is very important. Therefore, I serve as both Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, and the proper handling of state affairs must be carried out with war as the object. However, while state affairs should adapt to combat, combat should also fully consider the requirements of state affairs. At this moment, the harmony between the two is extremely harmonious, and the liaison meeting between the government and the Supreme Command serves as today's highest policy and seeks to adjust the two. As Prime Minister, I have a clear understanding of state affairs, and at the same time, as Minister of the Army, I can also participate in the command and know its details. Therefore, I can make the relationship of the command immediately reflect on state affairs, and I can make the progress of state affairs reflect on combat. Today, the harmony between combat and command, especially with industry, is the most important, so I believe that combat should consider national strength and properly apply the relationship between combat and national strength."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Captures 300,000 Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Lieutenant General Oyama Fumio, Director of the Legal Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, declared at a meeting of the Committee for the Revision of Military Law in the House of Peers today that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has captured a total of 300,000 prisoners of war, including 118,000 Westerners, including British, American, Dutch, Australian, and Canadians, most of whom are detained in the occupied areas, and some of them are also detained in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. As of January 20th of this year, 90 people have been tried by military tribunals. As for the prisoners of war captured in the Chinese war, they are currently treated in accordance with military discipline.</p>
<h3>Burma Border Defenses Consolidated; Allied Aircraft Shot Down 70 Planes</h3>
<p>A Japanese air base in Burma, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: It was learned today that in the Indian-Burma theater in January, a total of 70 Allied aircraft were shot down or destroyed by Japanese aircraft or Japanese anti-aircraft fire, which shows that the Japanese defenses in the Burma border area are as solid as gold, and the combat power of enemy pilots has shown a marked decline. Among the enemy aircraft destroyed, 23 were shot down by Japanese fighters, 17 were destroyed on the ground, and Japanese anti-aircraft fire shot down 30 enemy aircraft that invaded Burma. The losses suffered by the Allied air force during Japanese night raids on India are also included in this number. A total of six Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Rangoon</h3>
<p>Rangoon, February 1st, Allied News Agency: A squadron of seven enemy aircraft appeared over the Burmese capital Rangoon this afternoon and indiscriminately bombed the city. A Sulta and an Indian temple were hit by bombs, and Burmese and Indians who had taken refuge in them were killed and injured.</p>
<h3>New York Citizens Demonstrate and March</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to the New York Times, New York citizens held up the banner of "Liberate Indian Prisons" on the 26th and blocked the road to demonstrate in front of the British Consulate General. When the police arrived to try to stop them, a conflict broke out, resulting in the arrest of 22 citizens. It is reported that an anti-British demonstration also took place in front of the British Embassy in Washington on the same day, and 25 citizens were arrested.</p>
<h3>Fascist Legion of Italy Celebrates Anniversary: Mussolini Personally Delivers Address, Vowing to Sacrifice Everything and Never Surrender</h3>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday marked the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Legion. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace, Fascist Legion Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Giarpiatti, and numerous key figures from the party, government, and military, observed the commemorative exercises held in central Italy. After reviewing the Fascist Legion and student volunteers, Mussolini delivered an impromptu speech, expressing his determination to fight for ultimate victory. He stated, "Today is the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Legion. It is of great significance that we are holding this commemorative ceremony here. I deeply hope that you will demonstrate your strength and value. In this crucial stage of the decisive battle, you should continue to train with unwavering will. Although the scale of the war is large, I believe that ultimate victory will surely belong to us, the Fascist Legion. You should continue to advance and set an example for the nation. I deeply know that you have no other desire in life, and I deeply believe in your loyalty."</p>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Domei) - Yesterday, on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party's army, Prime Minister Mussolini addressed the party army, stating that Italy would not cease fighting until it had achieved final victory with its Axis comrades.

<p>Rome, 2nd (Rengo) - During the military review held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Legion, the Italian Prime Minister gave an address, saying, "The significance of the Fascist Legion celebrating its anniversary during this period of iron and blood warfare is self-evident. We have been fighting against our primary enemy for thirty-two months, and the enemy has only achieved one victory. When news of the occupation of Libya spread, the Italian people remained extremely calm, firmly believing that our army would eventually recover the lost territory. Temporary gains and losses are not a concern. We vow not to surrender and will continue to advance. I deeply believe that you will not hesitate to sacrifice everything to serve the country."</p>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Rengo) - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the militia, inspected three battalions of boy scouts from the group, all of whom were seventeen years old. The inspection took place in southern Italy, as a demonstration to North Africa. The newly appointed Italian Army Chief of Staff General Ambrogio and General Bono both participated.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (Havas) - Today marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Militia. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech this morning, and the evening editions of various newspapers here have expressed enthusiastic welcome, emphasizing the unwavering will of the Italian people to continue fighting until final victory is achieved. For example, the Italian Daily stated that this unwavering determination is the best response to the declaration made by Churchill and Roosevelt in the port of Casablanca.

As for the Prime Minister's speech, it strongly emphasized the Italian nation's remembrance of Africa, and "we believe that the Axis powers will definitely be victorious in Africa. The Italian nation can always continue to fulfill its civilizing mission."</p>

The President arrived in Adana by train, and Churchill boarded the train to meet him. They traveled together to the President's summer villa in the Taurus Mountains. Local newspapers published the Turkish government's statement without commentary. Political and diplomatic figures believe that the outcome of the meeting is a victory for Turkey's neutral policy. According to Turkish officials who participated in the meeting, the Turkish official statement stated that both sides had harmonious opinions on post-war issues and did not mean that they had fully recognized the Atlantic Charter.

Australian Radio broadcast on the 2nd that, according to a dispatch from Ankara, Britain, the United States, and Turkey have concluded a defense alliance, but the content of the alliance was not mentioned at all. Therefore, the so-called British and American enhancement of material transportation to Turkey is nothing more than exaggerated propaganda.</p>

According to the British side, Churchill [missing text] continuing the policy decided in the Casablanca meeting. Although the British official statement did not mention that the Casablanca meeting had discussed the [missing text] issue of the Far East, the military preparations made by Britain there are undeniable. Churchill's purpose in [visiting] Turkey was to [missing text] the opening of the Dardanelles. If successful, Soviet ships could take this route to avoid the [missing text] voyage in the Arctic Sea [missing text]. [Missing text] Turkey's neutrality is over. However, Turkey has little interest in this plan, but out of friendship, the Turkish President [missing text] met with Churchill in Adana, and the British-Turkish agreement was concluded. Both sides agreed to issue a joint statement regarding this meeting. The material assistance agreed upon in the British-Turkish agreement is not worth much, as Germany also supplies Turkey with a considerable amount of [missing text]. Germany and Turkey have also concluded a friendly agreement. Therefore, the optimistic attitude created by British newspapers due to the Adana meeting has no [missing text] reason. As for the Turkish side, [missing text] maintained a reserved attitude. The news reported in the newspapers all came from the British side.

<h3>The Powerful Tojo Cabinet: Promoting New Talents Without Emphasis on Seniority, Implementing the Spirit of Selflessness and Public Service (Translated from the January Issue of "Enterprise") (2)</h3>
<p>The Background of Prime Minister Tojo</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo was born in Iwate Prefecture. His father was the famous Lieutenant General Tojo Eikyo, who was heavily relied upon for his introduction of German strategic theories during the time when General Kawakami Soroku served as Chief of Staff. Unfortunately, he was not tolerated by General Terauchi Masatake in the army and retired as a [missing character] general. His grandfather was a musician for the Southern Clan. Other figures born in Iwate Prefecture include Admiral Mine Mitsumasa, General Itagaki, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Tada, among others. Prime Minister Tojo also occasionally attended the "Morning Breakfast Meeting" of people from that prefecture. Prime Minister Tojo was born when his father, Eikyo, was the commander of the Kokura Division, and he lived in Kyushu during his childhood, so his connection with Iwate Prefecture is not deep, and he does not carry the accent of people from the Tohoku region.</p>
<p>He was a graduate of the 12th class of the Army War College. He graduated five classes earlier than General Hata Shunroku, the supreme commander of the army in China. He never served as a division commander. When the China Incident broke out, he was the commander of the Tojo Brigade and crossed the border of Manchukuo to advance into Inner Mongolia. He achieved the Battle of Beijing-Suiyuan in military history, so he also has the experience of a division commander. Furthermore, he accumulated a wealth of experience in both the military administration and military command systems. During his time as a lieutenant colonel, he served as an adjutant in the Ministry of the Army, a member of the General Staff Headquarters, an instructor of military science at the Army University, and a section chief in the Maintenance Bureau. During his time as a colonel, he served as a unit commander and a section chief in the General Staff Headquarters. During his time as a major general, he served as the director of military investigations and a brigade commander. During his time as the director of military investigations, the criticisms from political parties regarding the Manchurian Incident stirred up rumors of discord between the military and the people, and he was unable to quell the matter, causing [missing text]. During his time as a [missing character] general, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the Vice Minister of the Army, and the Director-General of Aviation. He had already become acquainted with [missing character] Secretary General Hoshino while in Manchuria.</p>
<p>When he was the Vice Minister of the Army, in Showa 13 (1938), he served as the vice minister under Army Minister Itagaki. At this time, he was known as the "Razor Vice Minister," demonstrating his administrative talents. Prime Minister Tojo meticulously recorded even the most minor details, so he had an exceptionally strong memory. From this time on, his reputation became associated with the great military administrator Umezu Mijiro.</p>
<p>He served as vice minister for only half a year, then transferred to Director-General of Aviation. When the second Konoe Cabinet was formed in Showa 15 (1940), he was promoted by his seniors to become Minister of the Army. Upon receiving the appointment, he immediately took a plane to visit the new emperor, then flew to Osaka to instruct the division commander. Such was his manner of doing things. From then on, his life became tense, with no spare time. He went to bed at 11:00 PM and woke up at 4:30 AM, diligently striving to dedicate himself to the country.</p>
<p>In October of Showa 16 (1941), he formed a cabinet after the third Konoe Cabinet—[missing text] for the first time in twenty years since General Baron Tanaka Giichi [missing text], the first cabinet formed by a [missing text] career military officer. The reason for the reappearance of such a cabinet was that former [missing text] Prime Minister [missing text] determined at the Ogikubo meeting that command and politics should be unified. The [missing character] international situation during the third Konoe Cabinet was almost the same as during the Warring States period. In the Warring States period, the ruling power was naturally in the hands of military commanders rather than civil officials. It can also be said to be an inevitable process towards a military-led cabinet. When Prime Minister Tojo formed his cabinet, he concurrently served as Minister of Home Affairs, which was a preparation for this. After entering the Greater East Asia War, the domestic situation became clearer, creating a stronger sense of unity, which is gratifying. Prime Minister Tojo's painstaking efforts, working diligently day and night, bearing the responsibility for the country's safety on his shoulders, are worthy of our praise and admiration.</p>
<p>President Suzuki's Political Power</p>
<p>The top staff member of the Tojo Cabinet, the one who drives political power, is President Suzuki of the Planning Board, who is Prime Minister Tojo's closest confidant, and Secretary General Hoshino. These two men are experienced, knowledgeable, and skillful cabinet members, making them the most perfect politicians. President Suzuki of the Planning Board is a passionate person. Secretary General Hoshino has served in Manchuria, is strong-willed, and has made many contributions to the Tojo Cabinet, making him Prime Minister Tojo's most trusted aide.</p>
<p>When President Suzuki of the Planning Board took office as a state minister, he expressed his feelings, saying, "As a commoner becoming a minister, I can only do my utmost to serve the country in the future." He was born in the mountain village of Futakawa in Sanbu County, Chiba Prefecture. He graduated from Hongo Elementary School and studied at the private Keisei Academy in Shibamachi for two years. In order to pursue further education, he went to Tokyo and entered Kyokuyo Middle School. After graduating, he entered the Army War College as a 22nd [missing character] graduate. After graduating, he was stationed in China and served as a news section chief, an instructor at the Army University, and an investigator at the Cabinet Investigation Bureau. Under the [missing character] Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke, he served as the Director of Political Affairs, and was highly praised.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Suzuki Chuichi is a passionate person. During his time as a lieutenant colonel serving as a news section chief under Army Minister Araki, he said, "To advance the country and politics, only one or two people with the spirit of being willing to go through fire and water are enough, there is no need for many people."</p>
<p>The subsequent developments in the domestic and international situation matched his predictions. His political philosophy became the principle of action, leading to the aforementioned progressiveness. His actions were like a war, moving forward bravely and resolutely. During the Manchurian Incident, as the news section chief, he rejected liberalism, created the term "advanced national defense," and rang the alarm bell for the national total war to awaken the public. From a historical perspective, he has considerable talent. During the Manchurian Incident, in order to persuade the financial authorities to raise the army budget, he visited the then-Finance Minister Takahashi at his private residence in Akasaka and discussed the situation for several hours. Using his qualifications as the news section chief to explain the budget to the finance minister, he was such a decisive and independent person. At that time, Finance Minister Takahashi angrily said to him, "You are an infantry lieutenant colonel, and I am an accounting lieutenant colonel." During his tenure as an investigator at the Investigation Bureau of the Hirota Cabinet, he joined forces with Okumura Kiwao and others to urge the government to implement electricity control. This kind of creative driving force also [missing character] came from passion.</p>
<p>After he became the President of the Planning Board, the political power of the Planning Board was greatly strengthened. The new [missing character] of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the simplification of administrative functions in various ministries were also designed by the political power of this Planning Board, and were implemented on the political power of the Cabinet, achieving the goal in one go. The Planning Board formulates everything. National plans, production expansion, and material mobilization all became the duties of the Planning Board, gaining the preemptive right to important national policy budgets, becoming a major part of the Cabinet, thanks to the great efforts of Lieutenant General Suzuki.</p>
<p>After Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa, transferred to [missing character] Minister, he became the [missing character] Director-General in fact and guided the Asia Development Board. During the Second Konoe Cabinet, he became a state minister and the President of the Planning Board, so he resigned from active duty. When Lieutenant General Yanagawa was the Vice Minister of the Army, Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki was the news section chief. They were old [missing character], and Lieutenant General Yanagawa trusted and entrusted everything to him when they worked together at the Asia Development Board.</p>
<p>Some people have criticized his stubborn and arrogant personality, saying that he is too sharp and has too many rough edges. But the current him is very different from when he was the news section chief and investigator. He has been successful after years of political experience.</p>
<p>Secretary Hoshino's Tenacity</p>
<p>Secretary Hoshino seems younger than President Suzuki of the Planning Board, and has not lost the youthful vitality and vigor of his youth. During his time in Osaka, he lived in Nishinomiya, and he and his wife used to pick up balls for people. His shabby clothes and hats remained the same even when he became famous. During the Second Konoe Cabinet, he was summoned to Ogikubo. He wore the Concord Association uniform and wiped his tears with a crumpled handkerchief. Everyone was shocked by his unconventional and unrestrained appearance.</p>
<p>He was born in Kamishu Shioda, and his father was a pastor of the Christian church. He grew up in Tokyo and Yokohama, retaining the characteristics of the Shioda tradition. After arriving in Manchuria, his unique style was further enhanced. After years of hard struggle, his character became quite tenacious. The couple had a sincere bond, and their love was deep. His wife was very virtuous and good at socializing. When lecturing on the stage, she spoke eloquently, captivating the audience. She was very active during the Manchurian era, frequently visiting the city hall and was known as the "Soong Mei-ling of Manchuria." Secretary Hoshino would not eat any dish that was not made by his wife, so his wife had to make dishes that suited his taste despite her busy life, making her his best domestic helper. His wife and Prime Minister Tojo's [missing character] are relatives. Recently, to avoid suspicion, even official exchanges have gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Hoshino Naoki left the Ministry of Finance for Manchukuo in Showa 7 (1932). During his time in the Ministry of Finance, Hoshino, along with Ishiwatari Sotaro and Irimano Takeo, were known as the Three Birds of the Ministry of Finance. He served as the chief of the management section of the tax bureau and the chief of the national property section of the construction and property bureau. In Showa 7 (1932), he went to Manchukuo to serve as the director of the general affairs department of the finance department of that country, then the vice-director of the general affairs department, and then [missing character] the director-general of general affairs. Before leaving for Manchukuo, his father-in-law encouraged him on his deathbed, saying, "You will be buried in Manchuria, so there is no need to be too sad now." After he said these words, he stepped onto the land of the continent. His activity in Manchuria was as expected by his father-in-law. Hoshino succeeded Ohtachi Shigeo as the secretary-general of general affairs. The director of the general affairs department often held the position for no more than one year, but he served for more than four years, successfully completing his task as the director-general of general affairs, presiding over this difficult position.</p>
<p>Hoshino has achieved a lot in the economy of Manchukuo. As the saying goes, "One hand holds the scriptures, and the other hand holds the sword." Hoshino, on the one hand, crushed the great ideals of the Wang Dao national construction, and on the other hand, he was calculating the accounts. So he got along very well with the military, and when he argued with arrogant soldiers, he would often say, "Please look at the numbers, isn't it very clear?" So his calculation for Manchukuo can really be called a master.</p>
<p>He worked hard in Manchukuo for about ten years and is a supporter of the Pan-Asianism (economic groupism) of Japan, China, and Manchukuo. The establishment of the high national defense system of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the importance to Japan, needless to say, Hoshino has experience in the practice of the economic group of China, Japan, and Manchukuo after the first five-year plan in Manchukuo, he personally experienced its necessity and importance. Because of this experience, when the Second Konoe Cabinet was formed, Hoshino was appointed as the President of the Planning Board.</p>
<p>Hoshino returned to the country during the Second Konoe Cabinet and served as the President of the Planning Board, and later as a Minister without Portfolio. He resigned in the middle and became a member of the House of Peers, introduced by Count Sakai Tadamasu and joined the research association. At this time, he indulged in [missing character] music. When Prime Minister Tojo organized the wartime cabinet, he humbly declined the position of secretary-general, saying that he was not capable. After taking [missing character] the position, he showed his unique personality and tenacity, becoming the pillar of the Tojo Cabinet and gaining the prime minister's trust.</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting to Occur in Tunisia: Rommel's Troops Engage in Rearguard Action, British Eighth Army Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - Churchill returned from Adana last night and told reporters that there would be intense fighting in Tunisia in the coming months or weeks. The British hope to drive out the German and Italian troops and prevent them from gaining a foothold in Africa.</p>
<p>Tangier, 2nd (Rengo) - The command of the Free French forces in Algiers announced that the Axis forces occupied the Feïd Pass in southern Tunisia yesterday afternoon after a massive tank assault. The Axis forces also launched attacks in the areas of Faïd and in the mountainous region between Sbeitla and Kairouan.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Rengo) - The Axis forces in North Africa, retreating into Tunisia, have arrived at a certain location some days ago. The terrain there is treacherous, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Rommel's strategy often involves a sudden rearguard attack on the enemy after the troops' advance automatically slows down, inflicting heavy damage. The battle between the British Eighth Army and General Rommel's Axis forces is currently taking place in this manner. Reports that the vanguard of the British army has reached the Mareth Line are completely inaccurate. Perhaps a few British motorcycles have crossed the Tunisian border, but the main force of the British Eighth Army is still in western Tripolitania. The Axis forces in Tunisia continue to expand their defense line, but it cannot be considered that they have already launched an offensive. The important mountain passes, such as the pass between Sfax and Gafsa, the pass between Gafsa and Meknassy, and the Sened Pass in the south, have all fallen into the hands of the Axis forces, which is sufficient to resist the Allied advance.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - London newspapers today published a report from the Allied Forces Command in North Africa, admitting that the city of Faïd has fallen. The city was occupied by a German tank unit after fierce fighting.</p>

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - After a standstill of about a week, Soviet forces on the Donets River launched an offensive yesterday. Their goal is clearly to break into the industrial area of the Donets Basin, but the German side had anticipated this plan and will not be taken by surprise. Soviet pressure in the Voronezh area has shifted to the southern flank. Soviet forces in Kursk continue their offensive. East of Rostov, between the Don River and the Caucasus, there has been no major fighting in the past few days. The movement of German troops has not been hindered by the enemy.

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin sources, the headquarters of General Paulus, commander of the German forces in Stalingrad, was originally located in the former Soviet political police headquarters in the city. The intensity of the fighting there for the past five days has been unprecedented.</p>

However, for the front-line troops who need to add identification to the flags used in contact with the Chongqing puppet regime, the Military Commission will formulate temporary measures separately. The original text of the National Government's order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the return of the National Government to the capital, a yellow triangular mark with the words "Peace, Anti-Communism, Nation Building" has been added to the top of the national flag for identification. Now, with the efforts of compatriots and comrades, the situation has further developed, adhering to the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Asianism, participating in the Greater East Asia War, and cooperating with Japan to defeat the common enemies of British and American aggression, therefore, a clear order is issued to remove all yellow triangular marks added to the top of the national flag from the 5th of this month. For the front-line troops who need to add identification to the flags used in contact with the Chongqing puppet regime, the Military Commission will formulate temporary measures separately. All our citizens should jointly recognize the mission of the times, work hard to complete the great cause of revitalizing China and defending East Asia, and encourage each other not to neglect this order. Chairman Wang Zhaoming of the National Government.</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of the Establishment of the East Asia League; Speech by Director Lin; The East Asia League and the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The 1st was the second anniversary of the establishment of the China General Association of the East Asia League. The Central Broadcasting Station specially invited Lin Bosheng, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Association, to broadcast a speech entitled "The East Asia League and the Greater East Asia War." He first stated that two years after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, according to the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Asianism and the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, the China General Association of the East Asia League was established to launch the East Asia League ideological movement. After one year, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the East Asia League movement changed from ideology to fact. After another year, the National Government resolutely joined the war, which further proved that our promotion of the East Asia League was not just a kind of speech, but a concrete action to achieve its realization. He then stated that a small number of people misunderstand the Greater East Asia War as a struggle between Japan and Britain and the United States in the Pacific, which is a great mistake. At the beginning of the peace movement, friendly countries advocated the construction of a new order in East Asia. The Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Three-Power Declaration clearly stated "the construction of a new order in East Asia based on the spirit of morality." The so-called new order, the so-called spirit of morality, is the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and also the foundation of the East Asia League. In other words, the Greater East Asia War is a war of the spirit of morality against hegemonicism and colonialism, and the combination of aggressive powers is a combination of utilitarianism. The East Asia League is a permanent combination based on the spirit of morality. Finally, he said that the Greater East Asia War is not just a military struggle. In the economic, political, and cultural aspects, a thorough struggle must be launched. Not only must we use force to drive out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, but also overthrow the political, economic, and cultural systems of British and American utilitarianism. At the same time, in the positive aspect, we must establish new political, economic, cultural, and military systems based on the spirit of morality, replace colonialism with the principle of a co-prosperity sphere, and replace utilitarianism with the spirit of morality, so that the East Asian nations can, within the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, build a new East Asian order based on the spirit of morality according to the four major guidelines of political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication of the East Asia League. On the second anniversary of the establishment of the China General Association of the East Asia League, we recall with the greatest sincerity and encourage all compatriots to work together under the four major guidelines of the East Asia League and with the spirit of the New National Movement to strive for the Greater East Asia War, completely revive China, and defend the mission of East Asia.</p>

<h3>British and American Anxiety Over the Difficulty of Counter-Offensives</h3>
<p>-Sakura</p>
<p>The lingering pain of New Guinea still lingers, German submarines are difficult to deal with</p>
<p>"Lisbon Special Telegram 24th dispatched by Sakura Special Correspondent" - The Soviet counter-offensive, the retreat of Rommel's army, and the British military commentators with agreed propaganda materials, have produced optimistic arguments. But there are still two real problems to consider. First, the threat of submarines, American assistance in materials and personnel is absolutely necessary for Britain, and this is also the key to victory or defeat, without American assistance, attacking Europe will be a dream. The activities of Axis submarines in all the world's oceans are becoming more and more aggressive. The revised Roth wartime insurance rates on the 16th listed the northern waters of the United Kingdom and the area near Malta in the western Mediterranean as outside the scope of coverage, indicating that these sea areas are considered the most dangerous places. The insurance rate for the Atlantic route from the United Kingdom to the Americas and the west coast of Africa has increased to 10%, the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope to Australia to 15%, the United Kingdom to the Red Sea, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Alexandria to Malta to 20%, and the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope and the Red Sea to Syria to 17%, and to Turkey to 20%.</p>
<p>Military commentator Harky said in the Sunday Times: "More submarines are being built than sunk, but half of the ships lost by the British and Americans this year cannot digest the attacking power with their transportation capacity." Emmanuel said in the Daily Express: "The German submarine according to the Secretary of the Navy has 500 ships, but in fact there are probably more than this number. Since the beginning of the war, the losses of the British and Americans have exceeded the total tonnage of Britain in 1935. Even if the United States builds a lot of ships, if there are no fast and defensive cargo ships, escort warships, and escort aircraft, the shipbuilding plan will eventually be disappointed."</p>
<p>Although experts have various countermeasures for submarines, they are nothing more than bombing submarine factories, naval and air force escorts, and building fast cargo ships. Because none of these can achieve absolute results, it is impossible to decide which strategy to focus on. The results of bombing the factories did not reduce the production of submarines as the government claimed. In short, without a proper solution, the threat posed by submarine tactics in this war is far greater than in the last war.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the land battles in New Guinea have made the difficulty of fighting Japan even more painful. A special correspondent from The Times reported, saying that the Japanese army is strong, unafraid of death, and difficult to attack. The newspaper's editorial on the 14th advocated that a policy of piecemeal destruction should not be adopted, but that all efforts should be made to defeat Japan first. The editorial argued: "Sea power depends on air power, and air power depends on land power. If airfields are opened in China to carry out large-scale air strikes, Japan will immediately occupy them with its army. Therefore, at this time, when fighting Japan, strong land forces should be placed in Burma and the Pacific, and the air force should launch attacks from Burma to attack transport ships in the Pacific." Both newspapers simultaneously opposed making the continents the first battlefield and the Orient the second battlefield, and warned against the general battle theory of defeating Germany first and then attacking Japan, and downplaying the mistake of Japan. Due to the losses of huge warships and lives in the battle of New Guinea last year, a major warning was given. In order to defeat Japan, this kind of war should no longer be continued in the future, and it advocated regaining East Bengal Bay, reopening the Burma Road to assist the Chongqing army, and attacking Japan. The Sunday Times said on the 17th:</p>
<p>"This is the most correct argument. We are too far away from Japan to understand Japan. The only ones who can attack Japan are the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union has not yet joined the war with Japan. The biggest obstacles to the offensive theory are submarines and the Japanese army, and this is also the aim of the Axis powers." (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on January 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Active in Southern China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain frontline base of the Japanese army, the Yu army, which raided key points such as Shaoguan, Guilin, and Yong'an, has suffered severe bombing by the Japanese air force. Its troop strength and military facilities in these areas have been almost completely destroyed. In order to regroup and make a comeback, they are attempting to stir up trouble. In order to thoroughly punish them, the Japanese air force continues to bomb the Yu army's bases in the Xijiang and Beijiang areas. They also repeatedly attacked the Yu army units advancing in spite of the bad weather. The following is a record of the activities of the Japanese air force from the 26th of last month to the 1st of this month. On the 26th, a bomber squadron attacked Wengyuan, 60 kilometers southeast of Shaoguan, and severely bombed the barracks of the 156th Division of the Yu army, 4 kilometers northwest of the city, destroying 60 houses. In addition, it bombed military facilities south of the city. Another squadron attacked Zhaoqing, dropping heavy bombs on the headquarters of the 64th Army of the Yu army and its military facilities.

<h3>Prison Names in Various Provinces Changed to Local Place Names</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The new prisons in various provinces under the Ministry of Judicial Administration have been named with the order of establishment, such as the First and Second Prisons of a certain province. This has been the case for a long time without change. However, since the incident, some prisons in various provinces have been destroyed by war and cannot be restored. Those that are restored later still use the original names, resulting in situations such as Jiangsu province having no First or Second Prison, but having the Third Prison, and Anhui province having only the Second Prison, but no First Prison. The order is reversed, and the names do not match the reality. In view of this, the Ministry has made corrections, canceling the First and Second, etc., names of the prisons in various provinces and changing them to the place names where they are located, in order to make them uniform. The matter has been reported to the Executive Yuan for record yesterday, and instructions have been issued to the high courts of various provinces to instruct the prisons under their jurisdiction to comply.

<h3>Establishment of the Ministry of Food: Minister Gu Talks About Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing - The Ministry of Food was officially established on February 1st. Minister Gu Baochong announced his assumption of office at the same time and made an important speech on the policy guidelines of the Ministry of Food in the future. The main points are as follows: The National Government has established the Food Administration Commission for two years now. It first implemented management from the aspects of purchasing rice and distributing food to the people. Because there are other competent authorities for improving agriculture and increasing production, the Food Administration Commission did not take this into account. Now that it has been reorganized into a ministry, it will transition to the stage of overall management. From production to consumption, from main food grains to non-staple foods and substitutes, they will be guided and adjusted separately. When necessary, control will be implemented. The purpose of the Ministry's administration can be summarized as: making the best use of people's talents, land, and resources, enriching national reserves, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, thereby increasing the strength of the Greater East Asia War. According to the scope of food under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, in a broad sense, it includes not only rice, wheat, and flour, which are the main food grains in agricultural products, but also other non-staple foods such as miscellaneous grains, fish, meat, vegetables, eggs, and beverages such as tea, wine, soda, and seasonings such as oil, sauce, sugar, vinegar, etc. All those that can be used as food and are related to nutrition are included. However, salt is still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance due to tax relations. Among the main agricultural food grain management affairs, production policy is the most important, in other words, the issue of increasing production. It is now planned to first plan and implement facilities for the overall improvement of farmland, the widespread establishment of agricultural improvement experimental areas, the replenishment of seeds and fertilizers, the increase of agricultural tools and plowing cattle, the assistance of rural economy, the restoration of wasteland, the repair of dikes and ditches, and the breeding of livestock, the improvement and addition of food factories, etc., to promote the increase of wartime food production.</p>
<p>Regarding the strengthening of management, all manufacturers and vendors will be organized in order to promote the implementation of planned economic policies. Subsequently, it is planned to strictly implement the registration and licensing system to guide the organization of legitimate and systematic commercial groups. All legitimate merchants will be given practical protection to restore and increase the vitality of merchants. Speculation and black market trading will be cracked down on in order to thoroughly control and strengthen the guidance of general price reduction. Regarding distribution and consumption, in this extraordinary period, fairness and thrift are the first priorities. It is necessary to be consistent from top to bottom, work hard and be self-reliant, and at the same time, maintain adequate nutrition and avoid waste, in order to jointly overcome today's difficulties. From the government's standpoint, it must enable the general public to obtain various foods within the necessary limits at reasonable prices. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to requiring the public to help each other sincerely and promote self-awareness, the government will implement a ticket system when necessary. For example, essential oils and other items will be implemented in the same way as the rice ration method implemented in Beijing.</p>
<p>In short, today's food administration is extremely important and complex. I have been ordered to preside over it, and I vow to work carefully and diligently with all my colleagues in order to live up to the heavy trust of the country and the ardent expectations of the people. As for the rice and grain business handled by the Food Administration Commission in the past, a General Management Office for Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales has been specifically established to manage and operate it independently and continuously. This is where the nature of the Ministry and the former Food Administration Commission are slightly different.</p>
<h3>Federal Reserve Notes and Japanese Yen Maintain Parity</h3>
<p>Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - When the Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau No. 1 of the Beijing Office of the Japanese Embassy in China met with a group of reporters a few days ago, he talked about the recent currency issue in North China. The main points were that the principle of parity between the yen (Japanese yen) and the yuan (Federal Reserve Note) will be maintained from beginning to end. It is true that various contradictions have arisen in economic policy due to the parity between the yen and the yuan, but abandoning the principle of maintaining parity will lower the value of the currency in North China, which is also not a good solution. The problem in the future lies in how to eliminate these contradictions, promote the exchange of materials, and revitalize industry. All this must be based on the solution of the price problem. In this regard, the North China Political Affairs Commission should strive to strengthen its financial strength and improve its political strength.</p>
<h3>Supreme Advisor Matsui Returns to Beijing After Inspecting the Political Situation in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Matsui, the Supreme Military Advisor of the National Government, went to eastern Zhejiang a few days ago to inspect the political situation. It is now learned that he returned to Beijing at 2:20 p.m. on the 1st.</p>

Li also made a speech, stating that after the former Border Affairs Commission was changed to the Border Affairs Bureau, the internal administration was reduced compared to before. The Border Affairs Bureau will only set up three sections in the future: General Affairs, Mongolian Affairs, and Tibetan Affairs. The personnel have already been decided.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Committee Meeting Held Yesterday, Resolved to Pay Tribute to People Who are Familiar with Helping Students, Encourage All Selected Students to Cultivate Morality and Study Hard</h3>
<p>The fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been accepting applications and registrations since January 15th. In a short half-month, all primary and secondary school students have completed the examinations. The review and verification procedures for the university group and the industrial and commercial organizations have also come to an end. Therefore, a scholarship fund committee meeting was held at this newspaper yesterday to decide on various important matters related to this year's scholarship. All the committee members were concerned about the students and gave many instructions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Summary Report of Handling Affairs</p>
<p>The Scholarship Fund Committee met at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The attending committee members were Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, Mr. Zhao Zongyu, Ms. Nie Yu (represented by Chen), and more than ten colleagues from the scholarship fund office of this newspaper. First, the colleagues from this newspaper reported on the scholarship situation this year: (1) The students who applied for the scholarship and participated in the examinations this year were: (A) 84 students in grades 5 and 6 of primary school; (B) 1634 students in junior and senior high school; (C) 215 university students; (D) 60 students in the industrial and commercial group. (2) As of today, the scholarship funds received from all sectors this year total 254,739.40 yuan. In terms of the enthusiastic donations, we should thank all sectors. In terms of the number of students applying for scholarships, which is more than 2,700, we still feel that we cannot provide universal assistance. (3) More than 2,400 primary and secondary school students this year were entrusted to the male and female youth associations to conduct the examinations, which was extremely hard work. We would like to express our gratitude. (4) This year, a total of 18 primary and secondary schools sent letters to support this newspaper's scholarship movement and donate funds. (5) Mr. Zeng Gongye, Mr. Pu Qiting, and Mr. Dai Cangqi, who are lonely and suffering in their old age, have either donated clothes or paintings to help students, and their enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions - Totaling Ten Items</p>
<p>Subsequently, various proposals were discussed: (1) The committee believes that all sectors have enthusiastically supported this newspaper's scholarship movement and should express sincere gratitude. (2) Approved the list of students approved for scholarship funds at all levels of primary and secondary schools. (3) Resolved that the list of students approved for scholarships in the university group and the industrial and commercial group will be approved and announced at the next meeting. (4) Madam Yao Zhao's will to help students, the funds collected by this school on behalf of all sectors totaling more than 19,000 yuan, and the proposal by the Yao family to establish a separate fund committee were resolved to be approved and transferred to the fund committee to handle scholarship matters. (5) Mr. Gu Dingfu, Jing'an Temple, Female Youth Association, and Mr. Zhu Yiyun of Dacheng Xinsheng Silk Factory sent letters stating that they either designated the funds or requested that the selection procedures be handled on their behalf in installments. Resolved that this newspaper's scholarship fund should continue to be handled in accordance with the past policy. We are extremely grateful to those who enthusiastically donate funds and should handle them separately in accordance with the regulations. (6) Resolved to continue to approve the various fees for disaster-stricken children this semester. (7) Resolved to liberally approve the scholarship funds for students whose families are particularly poor. (8) Resolved to provide assistance as much as possible to students in the sixth grade of primary school, the third grade of junior and senior high school, and the third grade of university who are applying for scholarships and are only one semester away from graduation, in order to complete their studies. (9) Resolved to supervise the studies of all students who have been approved for scholarships in the past and continue to provide assistance as much as possible. (10) Students who failed the examination this year will be re-examined on a regular basis. Based on the principles resolved in cases 7, 8, and 9, in addition to the students who are approved for scholarship funds this year, the remaining funds will be allocated for assistance.</p>
<p>Hope That Students Cultivate Morality and Study Hard</p>
<p>The committee members, in the midst of their busy official duties, braved the wind and rain to attend the meeting at this newspaper yesterday. Committee members Chen, Lu, and Shen gave detailed guidance and encouragement to the colleagues on the future scholarship work, and their sincere concern for the situation of poor students and their kind words are always the original intention of people from all walks of life to donate funds. The committee members believe that the amount of scholarship funds collected from all sectors this year, during this period of general business closure, is a testament to the courage of the social people to do good and promote the spirit of human mutual assistance, which is very valuable. In addition, the committee members also hope that the assisted students will cultivate morality and become capable talents, so as not to disappoint the expectations of all sectors for scholarship assistance.</p>
<p>Junior High School List to Be Announced Today</p>
<p>The list of students approved for scholarships in junior high school will be announced in this newspaper starting today, in order to avoid the students waiting for the announcement. The procedures for the funds are being rushed, and a notice will be issued later. It is hoped that the students will bring their registration certificate and the seal that matches the one used when applying, and come to the newspaper in person to receive the funds on time.</p>

<p>Yesterday, letters were received from various sectors donating funds, including (1) a letter from the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of the Chinese Nation stating that the association held a drama propaganda performance of "Jiang Zhou Crying Blood" at the Da Guangming Theater on December 8th and 9th last year. After deducting all expenses, the remaining stored banknotes totaled 28,000 yuan. The preparatory committee for the drama propaganda performance unanimously elected Mr. Li Guohua, Zhang Shankun, and Li Pingqian to be responsible for distributing the remaining funds to various public welfare organizations.

<h3>Request for Metered Grain Distribution for the City District</h3>
<p>— 3rd installment</p>
<p>The metered grain distribution of the concession authorities, with ten days as a period, ordered the rice shops to sell, never failing to do so on time, and there was never any difference in the quality and price of the rice sold by each rice shop during the same period of metered grain distribution. Looking back at the metered grain distribution in the city district, it is completely different. It has never been possible to distribute it on time. Delays pile on delays, and the three installments per month are completely delayed and vanish without a trace. Moreover, within the same period of so-called metered grain distribution, there are often differences in price and rice quality. As a resident of the Nanshi district, I am very familiar with the metered grain distribution in Nanshi, having personally experienced it. I would like to describe it in detail so that the relevant authorities can understand the general situation and implore the City Grain Administration Bureau to sympathize with the people's plight and improve the system.</p>
<p>For the first month or two, the metered grain distribution in Nanshi was actually household-based, not individual-based, with each household receiving one dou of rice per period, without a fixed schedule. It was not until October of last year that individual-based metered grain distribution was implemented. However, the three installments of grain that should have been received in mid-October were not issued until the end of November. The quantity was also reduced from two sheng of white rice per person per period to one sheng and five ge of broken rice per person per period. One installment in between was supplemented with one jin of flour per person. The November installment was delayed until early December, with 1.4 sheng of brown rice per person (another ge of rice less), and the half jin of flour per person missing from the second installment in October was provided as a supplement. Later, on December 25, the second installment for November was issued, totaling 1.4 sheng of white and broken rice. The third installment for November was not distributed until January 7 of this year, with 1.4 sheng of white rice and 1.5 jin of flour. Afterwards, the rice tickets were changed, effectively canceling the December installment, and the rice tickets received were the three-part rice and flour tickets for January of the 32nd year of the Republic. The first part, the rice ticket, was used to receive two sheng of brown rice per person on January 20 (according to the household rice issued in the first and second wards, it was 1.6 ge of white rice and 4 ge of broken rice per person, costing five yuan, while in the third ward where I live, it was purely brown rice, and the selling price was one jiao more expensive, at 5.1 yuan per person). The second part, the grain ticket, was used to distribute 1.8 sheng of white rice per person on January 30 (another two ge of rice less than the previous installment), costing 4.6 yuan. As of February 2, there has been no news of the distribution of the third installment, and the three-part flour ticket has not yet been issued. Originally, the household rice was not enough to maintain the minimum needs of an individual. Now, the city district's distribution is much less in quantity than that of the two concessions, and there is no flour to supplement it. Moreover, it is often delayed and canceled altogether. Therefore, all the innocent people in our million-strong city district are craning their necks and longing, hoping that our city district authorities will quickly improve the situation to help our million starving people. I believe that our wise city district authorities will be able to understand the feelings of the people and make some gestures. At the very least, they should be able to effectively implement the following points in the shortest possible time:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the date of grain distribution. (2) Supplement each installment with flour. (3) Ensure that the quality, price, and quantity of rice are the same in all districts. (4) Order all rice shops not to deliberately create difficulties.</p>
<p>The Second Voice, He Lan</p>
<p>Your newspaper's loud call for attention to the food problem has obviously achieved considerable results. Isn't the ration of household rice and household flour increasing installment by installment? Although the current ration is still not enough to meet all the needs, the severity of the food problem has gradually decreased with the increase in the ration. But this is referring to the two concessions. As for our Shanghai Fourth District, the food problem is still very serious. At the same time, the grain administration authorities seem to think that everyone can still buy 1.5 sheng of white rice, 6 ge of brown rice, 7 ge of broken rice, and 1.5 jin of flour. Today, the rice purchase certificate was finally issued, but each person is only allowed to buy 7 ge of white rice, 1.1 sheng of brown rice, and 2 ge of broken rice. In total, each person will buy 2.2 sheng of white rice, 1.7 sheng of brown rice, 9 ge of broken rice, and 1.5 jin of flour this month. I ask, how many days will this amount of food last one person? This problem is serious enough in normal times, let alone now that the authorities have issued a ban prohibiting the free entry of food, which naturally makes the problem even more acute. Although the Shanghai West District is not without wealthy families, the hidden poor and the destitute still account for the majority, no, they account for the vast majority. I have an income of one thousand and several hundred yuan per month, and the organization I serve allows me to buy 1.35 dou of specially rationed rice per month, but in recent months, there has not been a single month where I have not spent more than I earned, resulting in borrowing and pawning. I examined my accounts and found that most of the money was spent on supplementing food. Now, the black market rice is more expensive and not easy to buy. If the grain ration cannot be increased, then I simply cannot live. I think there must be many residents in the Shanghai West District who are in the same situation as me, or even worse. The threat they face from the food problem can naturally be imagined. On behalf of the 1.5 million residents of the Shanghai West District, I earnestly hope that the grain administration authorities in the Shanghai West District can understand the difficulty of the people's food and quickly achieve the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Issue another 1.2 sheng of rice and 4.2 jin of flour per person this month. This, together with what has been issued before, is exactly equal to the quantity distributed by the two concessions in one month.</p>
<p>(2) From February onwards, the method and frequency of monthly distribution, and the quantity of each distribution, should be exactly the same as in the two concessions.</p>
<p>I believe that what the authorities of the two concessions can do, the grain administration authorities of the Shanghai West District can certainly do as well. I also believe that the grain administration party authorities in the Shanghai West District must be no less concerned about maintaining the people's food supply than the authorities in the two concessions. I hereby express my sincere hope!</p>
<p>The Third Voice</p>
<p>Since the strict control of the grain administration was implemented on January 13, street vendors and rice merchants have almost disappeared from the market, and rice and noodle shops are all out of stock. The citizens are eager for household rice, but it cannot be distributed according to the same schedule as in the concessions. There are rumors of increasing the ration, but the most recent installment in the city district has actually been reduced. The first installment of household rice in January was not issued until the 21st, with 2 sheng per person, and the second installment was issued on the 29th, with 1.8 sheng per person, without any flour. There is still no news of the third installment. According to the ration in the concessions, it is only enough for five days, while in the city district, each person has only received 3.8 sheng in the two installments this month, making it impossible for people to eat their fill. The authorities implemented strict control originally to suppress the black market and benefit the people, but like an elastic, the black market is becoming more entrenched and the resilience is higher.

<h3>Temporary Extension for Purchasing Gunny Sacks; Overdue Violators Will Be Penalized and Confiscated: Announcement by the Office of the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>The office of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, in view of the peak season for agricultural products and to ensure the supply of gunny sacks for packaging agricultural products, had previously consulted with the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau to purchase gunny sacks stored in the city. However, the purchase period was very short, and the purpose of the authorities' purchase had not been fully understood by the general public. Therefore, the purchase period has been extended to February 13. It is hoped that the citizens will cooperate. Those who miss the deadline again and fail to sell to the authorities will be confiscated, and the owners will be severely punished. The office of the Japanese Embassy has recently issued the following statement regarding this matter: "Our embassy office previously consulted with the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau to implement the purchase of gunny sacks stored in the city, as you citizens are aware. The results of the purchase have been very smooth recently. However, because the purchase period is very short and the methods for informing the citizens have not been thorough, there are likely many who have not fully understood the details of this plan. Therefore, the municipal authorities have decided to extend the deadline to February 13. During this extended period, the purchase method will be the same as before. We will not take coercive measures. It is hoped that the citizens will cooperate voluntarily. If the expected goal is not achieved during this period, then the three municipal authorities will take coercive measures such as confiscation for any gunny sacks found thereafter, regardless of the circumstances. We sincerely hope that the citizens understand that this purchase plan will achieve significant results in the restoration of Shanghai and the reconstruction of Central China. We hope that everyone will take the lead in cooperating with the authorities to avoid coercive measures that are not originally intended by the authorities and are also extremely dishonorable for all citizens."</p>
<h3>Women's Welfare Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>Since its establishment on the 29th of last month, the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association has spared no effort in promoting its affairs. In order to expand its organization, it has started publishing advertisements on the 1st to openly solicit members. Intellectual women from all walks of life are welcome to participate enthusiastically. It is said that the procedures are very simple. The association's address is No. 984, Lane 972, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Muir Ming Road. Registration hours are from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Monday to Friday. Latecomers will not be entertained.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Move to New Location</h3>
<p>Before the August 13th Incident, the Bank of China started constructing a new building on the Bund. However, due to the outbreak of the incident, the construction was interrupted. Later, the Central Reserve Bank hired workers to continue the construction of the new building, which has now been completed. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank will soon move into the new building to conduct its business.</p>
<h3>Retail Sales Tax May Not Be Exempted; Invoices Must Be Issued for All Purchases, Regardless of Amount</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession stipulated that all companies and merchants must collect a 2% retail sales tax when selling goods at retail. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. It is now learned that some shops sometimes exempt this retail sales tax, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, special personnel will be dispatched to investigate at any time. Any merchant who sells goods, if they are indeed retail sales, must collect the retail sales tax in accordance with the law and may not freely exempt it. Otherwise, if discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, all retailers must issue invoices for the sale of goods, regardless of the amount, so that the authorities can review whether the amount of goods sold is consistent with the retail sales tax collected.</p>
<h3>Final Settlement Period for the Banking Industry; Ticket Collection Hours Remain the Same; Chinese New Year is Approaching, Work is Tense</h3>
<p>All banks and money shops in the city's banking industry are particularly busy with the final settlement procedures for the end of the lunar year, as the deadline is approaching. Although it is impossible to find the exact amount of all ticket exchanges, customer account receipts, and interbank lending figures, they have increased more than twice as much as in the previous week. The work of each bank, shop, the Banking Association, the clearing house, the Money Industry Reserve, the Money Industry Market, and other aspects has been very tense, and the office hours seem to have been extended. In the concentrated areas of banks and shops, the personnel for collecting accounts and remitting funds are coming and going frequently. The reporter learned from the financial sector yesterday that the ticket collection time for the final settlement of the money industry will not be changed, as the association decided at the executive committee meeting last time to wait for consultation with the Banking Association before issuing a notice for compliance. Now, the money industry has sent personnel to consult with the Banking Association, and the ticket collection time for the two industries has been decided to remain unchanged, with the time ending at 4:00 pm. The external business and office hours and the return time for tickets have also been decided to remain unchanged. It is reported that the interbank foreign exchange rate of the money industry was reduced to 1.4 jiao yesterday.</p>
<h3>Councilor Okazaki Comes to Shanghai to Promote Economic Measures; Conveys the Intentions of the Greater East Asia Ministry to Various Agencies; Will Consult with Economic Giants of China and Japan on Various Issues</h3>
<p>Okazaki Kahira, Councilor of the Greater East Asia Ministry, came to Shanghai via North China to promote the economic measures of the National Government participating in the war, to convey the intentions of the Greater East Asia Ministry to various agencies stationed in China, and to consult with relevant parties on important matters. He arrived in Shanghai on the 1st and stayed at the Whiteaway Laidlaw Building. Okazaki met with Okuda, the Minister of Economic Affairs at the Shanghai Office of the Embassy that day and had some discussions. He will also consult with economic giants of China and Japan on various economic issues.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Concessions Increase Household Rice</h3>
<p>Increasing the quantity of household rice has been a unanimous demand of the people of the city. In the past, this newspaper's suggestions and the public's appeals have been repeated again and again. The authorities have also expressed deep concern about this issue. First, on January 13, they issued an order prohibiting the free transfer of food, in order to uniformly purchase food from the interior and transport it to Shanghai for distribution. Now, they have decided to increase the quantity of household rice, from 4.8 kilograms per person per month to 6 kilograms (i.e., from 6 sheng to 7.5 sheng), an increase of a quarter. The increased quantity may not yet meet the needs, but it is enough to prove that the authorities can value public opinion and adopt the people's will. Here, on the one hand, we firmly believe that the authorities will continue to find ways to increase it to the most basic quantity per person as soon as possible; on the other hand, we thank the authorities for their concern for the people's suffering. At the same time, now that the concessions have decided to increase, we also hope that the food authorities in the city district will quickly plan to improve the situation, as this newspaper has repeatedly received reports from readers in the city district (see this newspaper's Reader's Forum today) that the ration quantity is less than that of the concessions, and the distribution dates are not accurate.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Moves to New Location</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank will soon move into the former Bank of China's new location to conduct business. Before August 13, the Bank of China was building a large building on Nanking Road and the Bund, but the construction was interrupted due to the incident. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the building was regarded as enemy property and managed by the Japanese army. Now it has been returned to the National Government and designated for use by the Central Reserve Bank. This move by the Japanese authorities aims to assist the development of the Central Reserve Bank. How the bank will operate well in the future to consolidate finance, strengthen the wartime economy, and fulfill the mission of the national bank is something we eagerly look forward to.</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred Groups Registered with the Public Works Department Have Been Approved and Given Certificates</h3>
<p>Since the Public Association Department of the Public Works Department Police Headquarters was established and ordered all industrial and commercial groups and trade associations within the concession to apply for registration, the deadline has expired. It is reported that a total of 422 groups have registered, and 124 units have been issued certificates for establishment. The rest are still under strict review.</p>
<h3>The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance Intensifies the Collection of Profit Tax; Orders Subordinates to Compile a Merchant Register</h3>
<p>Since the income tax of the Ministry of Finance has been levied, the tax collection has been on the right track. However, there are still many who do not declare and pay taxes. In order to increase tax revenue and prevent tax evasion, the Ministry of Finance has decided to intensify the collection of profit income tax for the first category of Class A and B profit-making enterprises. It has been ordered to compile a merchant register for verification. A notice has been sent to the tax collection bureaus in each district to send personnel to investigate the addresses, capital amounts, and profit status of each company, shop, and factory in the district and to start compiling a merchant register. Unified bookkeeping is also being implemented to facilitate verification and report taxes on profit income as accurately as possible. The compilation of the merchant register must be completed before the end of March of this year and reported for approval.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Standard Water Ladles Is Temporarily Limited to Use in the City District; The Two Concessions Will Set a Separate Date for Issuance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Association was previously notified by the Metrology and Testing Office of the Social Bureau that all water ladles used by the boiled water shops must be in accordance with the 1000cc standard capacity to standardize them and must be replaced within a limited time. After receiving the order, the association immediately produced a batch of standard water ladles and began issuing them in late last month. It is learned that the issuance of the first batch of water ladles is temporarily limited to the city district members, while the members in the two concessions are waiting for a separate date.</p>
<h3>Selection of Students for the Central Youth Cadre School; Initial Test Results Announced in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The selection of the second batch of students for the Central Youth Cadre School in Shanghai was entrusted to the Shanghai Special City Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and Feng Jie, a member of the school affairs committee, was appointed as the examiner. It is reported that the New Movement Committee Shanghai Branch has been actively conducting the selection process.

The admitted students will complete all the procedures from the 3rd to the 7th of this month and will go to Beijing on the 8th to participate in the school's re-examination.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department, Industrial and Social Affairs Department Report for January</h3>
<p>Last month, several rubber factories that had stopped work previously resumed work, and many small chemical factories were established, manufacturing chemicals to replace imported goods. The bleaching powder factory business was not as good as before. The coffee essence factory was affected by the decline in the price of its products. Recently, the atmosphere has been dry, and the tap water contains salt, which has made the manufacturing of the products quite difficult.</p>
<p>Ensuring Safety</p>
<p>The Bureau's Newsletter published an announcement, ordering people who use elevators to strictly comply with the Bureau's regulations for elevator operation. Elevators must be inspected on schedule to avoid excessive crowding of passengers to ensure safety. Charcoal factories have complied with the improvement of equipment to prevent smoke leakage. There were five fire alarms in factories, but there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Boiler Inspection</p>
<p>Fourteen steam pressure machines were registered, eight boiler inspection certificates were received, and fifty-four annual re-inspections were received. Eighteen boilers were affixed with the Bureau's number. One boiler manufacturing factory owner was sentenced by the court to ten days of detention for manufacturing boilers without the supervision of a qualified engineer.</p>
<p>Stoker Training</p>
<p>Seventy-six students in the 11th Boiler Stoker Training Class received their completion certificates. The 12th Fire Training Class is located in the East District and currently has seventy-four students. The two night schools for young technicians in the East and West Districts held major exams, and the students performed well, averaging above 80 points.</p>
<p>Job Placement</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Job Placement Section has registered 624 technicians and has introduced 127 to various factories. Among them, 27 have been hired, 31 are not suitable, and 42 are under consideration.</p>
<p>Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>The Industrial and Social Affairs Department mediated three industrial disputes, affecting 74 workers. The department convened many factory owners to discuss issues relating to wages, allowances, and the dismissal of workers.</p>
<p>Lost Children</p>
<p>The Child Protection Section handled 143 cases of children. Forty-four lost children were sent back to their families, seven were allowed to be adopted, and thirty-two were placed in special care facilities. The section plans to hold a Children's Happiness Week during the Lunar New Year to guide parents on how to prevent children from running away or getting lost.</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of the Rationing System, the Problems of Oil and Sugar Still Remain Unresolved. A New System May Be Implemented After the Lunar New Year.</h3>
<p>The problems of oil and sugar, two major food items in this city, have not been completely resolved recently. However, after the Lunar New Year, the supply of these two major food items will eventually have a formal solution implemented, no matter what.</p>
<p>Insufficient Distribution of Oil</p>
<p>Sensing the urgency of residents' needs during the Lunar New Year period, the wholesale office of the food oil industry held sales of oil at retail stores for the first two days of this month. However, because the ration was not large, most residents were still unable to enjoy this right. As for the automatic distribution of oil by population in some Baojia districts, it was entirely temporary in nature, and due to the cessation of rationing by the wholesale office, it eventually came to an invisible halt. Therefore, the oil industry authorities are now planning to implement a universal system of oil distribution by population, so that every resident can enjoy this major food item, so that it is not monopolized by a few people, and so that residents do not feel deeply troubled. Half a Catty of Sugar Per Person: After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to implement sugar rationing by population, all sugar distribution rules have now been decided. It was originally scheduled to start the fourth phase on February 1st, first piloting in the Nanshi area, based on the Baojia household registration book. The cooperative business office and the Baojia authorities have agreed on assistance measures. However, due to the inability to complete the household registration book in time, it was decided to postpone it to February 10th, and purchases will be made with the sugar purchase certificates issued in advance. However, according to the reporter's inquiry, the amount of sugar rationed in the pilot program is said to be temporarily set at half a catty per person. The price will be announced by the cooperative business office according to the official price limit, so that the public can be informed. Afterwards, the allocation amount will be determined according to the population ratio based on the monthly amount approved by the military allocation authorities. If the pilot program is effective, it will be universally implemented throughout the city from the fifth phase on March 1st. Before implementation, the Public Concession, the French Concession, as well as Huxi, Hongkou, and Zhabei will temporarily issue sales based on house tax tickets, all in accordance with the newly established improvement measures.</p>
<h3>Small-Scale Noodle Shops Have Been Given Flour Rations First</h3>
<p>The noodle product shops and stalls in the two concessions have repeatedly submitted documents to the authorities through the guild requesting the restoration of flour rationing. It is now known that the distribution of flour to cooked noodle businesses began yesterday. However, it is limited to small-scale noodle shops of the third and fourth class. The flour for the first and second class cooked noodle shops has not been rationed. The sliced ​​noodle industry (i.e. raw noodle shops) has been closed for a long time. The day before yesterday, representatives were dispatched again to petition the competent authorities, following the cooked noodle industry, to quickly restore flour rationing to maintain livelihoods and facilitate public purchases. It is now known that the authorities are reviewing it. As for the flour rationing for the flatbread and fried dough stick industry and the cake and steamed bun industry, the flour rationing office of the Materials Control Department once convened representatives of the two industries for discussions the day before yesterday, considering that they are foods for the working class, and other remedial measures will be discussed and given priority to supply products, so as to facilitate the public in the lower classes.</p>
<h3>The 25th Term of Rations Shortened the Purchase Period</h3>
<p>The registered rice shops in the two concessions issued a temporary announcement yesterday, stating that the water shops have been instructed by the authorities to handle the 25th term of rations per capita starting from February 1st. All white rice will be issued at two liters and flour at one catty and twelve taels per ration ticket for 8.85 yuan. However, the sales period for this term has been shortened to seven days. The 5th and 6th of each day (the first and second days of the Lunar New Year) will be closed as usual. It is hoped that citizens holding tickets will come to purchase them as soon as possible. Once the deadline is exceeded, it will be regarded as self-abandonment, and the rice flour ticket will not be used. We hope that all sectors pay close attention. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>After the Merger Publication, a New Lineup of Small Newspapers</h3>
<p>The small newspapers in this city, under the responsible management of Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, were ordered to be adjusted and merged for publication in order to seek rational development. It is now known that the small newspapers have complied with the order and implemented the merger publication starting yesterday (1st). The new lineup of the merged small newspapers is revealed as follows: (1) The Seaport merges with the Telegraph, (2) The Power Daily merges with the Guangming Daily, (3) The Oriental Daily merges with the Shanghai Daily, (4) The Society Daily merges with the Xiong Daily, (5) The Shanghai Great News is changed to the Baojia Youth Organ Newspaper, (6) The Shanghai Daily is independent, (7) The Great News is independent, (8) The Robin Hood Shanghai Yue Opera Newspaper, the Drama Daily, and the Shen Opera Art Sea Daily are merged into the United Opera Newspaper, (9) The Lucky Daily, the Ten Thousand Words Newspaper, and the Peach Blossom News are merged into the Lucky Daily.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Shanghai West Security and Mutual Assistance Guidance Council: Unified Collection of Security and Mutual Assistance Expenses Commencing January 1st, Divided into Four Classes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Security and Mutual Assistance Guidance Council, recognizing that the collection of security and mutual assistance expenses in the Shanghai West District in the past was handled separately by each joint security office, inevitably leading to irregularities, has, through its fifth meeting, passed a resolution to unify the collection method, entrusting the Shanghai West Office of the Finance Bureau to handle the collection. Hereafter, residents of Shanghai West, in addition to paying the aforementioned security and mutual assistance expenses, will not be required to pay other security and mutual assistance fees. It is reported that the collection of January's security and mutual assistance expenses commenced on the 1st. The monthly security and mutual assistance expenses for residents are divided into four classes: Special Class, three yuan; Class A, two yuan; Class B, one yuan; Class C, exempt.</p>
<h3>Provisional Relief Center in Putuo District Continues Distribution of Relief Rice</h3>
<p>The Provisional Relief Center in Putuo District was established this spring. Appreciating the urgency of the matter, enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life have actively sponsored and donated funds and rice to assist in providing porridge and emergency relief in this district. For half a month, over 30,000 people benefited. At the end of the emergency relief, there was a surplus of over 14,000 national currency units. A survey was then conducted of 284 impoverished households in the district, totaling 997 individuals, and 10,264 national currency units were distributed. The remaining 4,000 yuan was divided and sent to (1) Renji Infant Nursery, (2) Labor Hospital, (3) Pushan Villa, and (4) Jingye Nursing Home, 1,000 yuan each. Furthermore, Accountant Li Wenjie of Lixin Accounting Firm was requested to voluntarily and personally audit all accounts. There was a remaining surplus of 13 bags of broken rice, totaling 2,600 catties. The Board of Directors resolved to use it for winter relief. The other day, relief rice was distributed at the Jade Buddha Temple. A total of 1,190 impoverished residents in the district received one sheng of broken rice each, and an additional two yuan in savings currency was distributed to each person, totaling 2,380 yuan (this amount was raised by the directors through donations). Another 220-plus people who arrived later were also given one sheng of broken rice each. The work of the center is now complete, and it is announced that it will be concluded.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Elementary School Changes Payment Date</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announces that the dates for paying tuition fees at the various Chinese children's elementary schools established by the Council were originally scheduled for February 8th and 9th. It has now been determined that the 8th is a regular holiday for the Council, and the office will be closed. Therefore, the payment dates for each elementary school have been changed to February 9th and 10th. Parents of students are requested to take note.</p>
<h3>Enhancing Familial Happiness for Citizens: "Children's Happiness Week" Begins, Led by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department, Ensuring Parents Gain Child-Rearing Knowledge</h3>
<p>In order to allow residents of this port to obtain the joy of family, to stabilize social order, and to maintain the normal development of the future masters of the world, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department is holding a "Children's Happiness Week" starting today, scheduled to conclude next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Increase in Cases of Lost Children</p>
<p>According to reporters, the reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council's launch of the Children's Happiness Movement is due to a particular increase in the number of children lost or running away from home. It has been found that a total of 912 such cases occurred last year, of which 635 cases were resolved satisfactorily through the efforts of the police. However, the whereabouts of the remaining children are still unknown. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department has launched a large-scale publicity campaign to seek the attention of parents and other guardians in this port.</p>
<p>Expanding Publicity and Child-Rearing Knowledge</p>
<p>During "Children's Happiness Week," the slogans and books for publicity are donated by the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory at 32 Jiangxi Road. The methods of publicity include posting slogans on the walls of various roads, sending staff to give street lectures, broadcasting propaganda stories on the radio, and showing educational films in cinemas. The content of these slogans, lectures, stories, and films generally aims to provide parents with sufficient knowledge of child-rearing, not to excessively indulge children, and not to excessively apply harsh methods. According to an official of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department who told reporters, the authorities hope that residents will not allow their young children to go out in the evenings, and hope that parents should weave their names and addresses on the clothes worn by their children with cotton yarn, so that in case of getting lost, the police can lead them back home. The authorities hope that the public will assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in handling this work. If a lost child is found crying in the street, an effort should be made to report it, in order to reduce the phenomenon of separation of families this year.</p>

<h3>Jiang Yilong Suddenly Retracts Confession in the Hua Liying Murder Case, Summons to All Witnesses, Retrial Postponed to Joint Collegiate Court</h3>
<p>The sensational murder case of Hua Liying, a dancer at the MGM Ballroom, who was strangled to death on November 12 of last year by young men Zhang Hongsheng and Jiang Yilong for failing to borrow money, was solved and sent to the Second Special Court, which sentenced Zhang to fifteen years of imprisonment and Jiang to seven years. The law enforcement authorities and Shen Wenjie, chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, both filed appeals to the Third Branch Court, arguing that the initial trial was inappropriate. The two defendants also appealed, hiring lawyers. Yesterday, Cai Rixin, chief of the Criminal Division of the Third Branch of the High Court, sat in the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Zhang Hongsheng was defended by lawyers Wu Linkun, Wang Shuxun, and Shen E, while Jiang Yilong was defended by lawyer Wang Yigong. First, Zhang Hongsheng was interrogated. According to his statement, "The initial judgment said that I strangled the deceased with a tie because I failed to borrow money, which I cannot accept. I want you to know that I had been with the deceased, Hua Liying, for many years and spent a lot of money. Moreover, my family is wealthy, so there is no need to borrow money. I had a very good relationship with the deceased and had no intention of harming her. Therefore, I am appealing because I do not accept this." The official asked him to explain the whole story. Zhang replied, "I have known Jiang Yilong for three years. He is addicted to gambling. Although I often went with him, I never gambled.</p>
<p>Gambling During the Day, Dancing at Night</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the incident, I went to Xiyuan to gamble with Jiang. He lost three or four hundred yuan. In the evening, we went to the MGM Ballroom, where we met a classmate, Xie Shanxin, who was also acquainted with Hua Liying, and danced with Hua on the stage. At that time, Hua Liying told me that Xie often pestered her and prevented her from doing business, so she asked me to mediate and invited me to talk at her house. So, I went to Hua's house after the ballroom closed. When leaving the ballroom, Jiang Yilong asked me where I was going, and I explained the situation. Jiang wanted to go with me. When we got to Hua's house, Jiang asked me to borrow money from Hua, but I refused. He then opened his mouth to Hua himself, and she ridiculed him."</p>
<p>She Called for Help, I Pressed Her Mouth</p>
<p>"Jiang became angry out of humiliation, went forward and pushed Hua onto the bed. She called for help, so I went forward and pressed her mouth shut. She then scratched my face and neck with both hands. I got up and went to the dressing table to look at my face. In that instant, Jiang jumped onto the bed and strangled Hua with a tie. When I realized it and pulled Jiang away, Hua had already died. The official asked, 'Why did you stuff a towel into her lower body after strangling Hua?' He replied that it was actually done by Jiang and Zhang to avoid the ears and eyes of the detectives, indicating that the deceased had been forcibly raped without success. Later, Jiang also took out the jewelry and gave it to me.</p>
<p>Exchanged for Cash, Then Went to the Casino</p>
<p>The next day, after exchanging it for cash in various places, Jiang gambled and lost in the Nanshi casino. He still had 1,050 yuan left, which Jiang returned to me for Dr. Fan's medical expenses and loan shark debts." The official then asked, "Your statement says that Jiang Yilong wrote a letter stating that he did this. What is the situation?" He replied, "Because I was crying in the detention center, his conscience discovered it, so he told me not to cry. He wrote to his father to try to rescue me from prison. The letter stated that he had done this and asked his father to try to rescue us." Jiang Yilong's interrogation stated, "Although I wear a suit, the tie used to strangle Hua was not mine."</p>
<p>They Quarrelled, I Went Outside</p>
<p>"On November 12, Zhang and I went to the casino to gamble during the day. After going out, we went to the MGM Ballroom. After Zhang finished dancing with Hua, Zhang asked me to accompany him to Hua's house. I saw them talking and laughing as if 后, but suddenly they quarrelled, so I went outside." The official asked, "You admitted at the morgue that you conspired with Zhang to kill her. Why are you retracting your confession today?" Jiang replied, "Zhang asked me to admit it." The official also asked, "Did you write a letter to your father stating that you did this and asking your father to rescue Zhang Gong-sheng?" Jiang replied, "Zhang also asked me to write it. It was not my intention." Then, the court summoned the handling detective, the fathers of the two defendants, Wang Hongshi, the nanny employed by the victim, and Zhou Peide, who collected Hua Liying's body, to testify. Because it was already 7:30 PM, the court decided to postpone the case and reopen it for a joint collegiate court trial.</p>
<h3>Chemical "Ammonium Sulfate" Fertilizer to Be Sold Throughout Central China, Already Adopted in North China Last Year</h3>
<p>The chemical fertilizer required for Chinese farmland is all produced by the British firm Brunner Mond &amp; Co. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source has been cut off. As a result, the price of soybean cake, a domestic fertilizer, has recently soared, rising from 60-70 yuan to over 110 yuan. According to reporters, a large batch of chemical "ammonium sulfate" fertilizer will soon be shipped from Japan. Japan is a sulfur-producing country, and the military industry has been particularly developed recently, so the residue from the manufacture of gunpowder can be used to make fertilizer. North China has already adopted it last year, and this year it will be transported and sold to Central China. Therefore, the soybean cake market will gradually stabilize in the future.</p>

<h3>The Teacher Speaks of Himself - The Edge of Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Jing Ling</p>
<p>My wife's abdomen is gradually swelling, and my eye sockets are slowly sinking. My wife understands my sorrow, and she sighs all day long. Life is so pressing, life is so difficult. The little life is lurking in her belly, and a tragic fate has already been arranged.</p>
<p>My monthly salary is difficult to cover the living expenses of my wife and me. We live in a pigeon cage-like attic, eat watery porridge, and wear old clothes with countless holes. I often confess to my wife that I feel sorry for her. Tearful eyes often meet. I say that I am too weak, but she also complains about her own incompetence, unable to share the burden of this small family.</p>
<p>Living beyond our means has become a daily routine, and the pawnshop has become a familiar acquaintance. The northwest wind blows incessantly, and the cold pricks make my teeth chatter. The thin jacket is still waving in the wind...</p>
<p>Seeing me coming home with books and papers, constantly trembling, my wife's eyes are filled with tears again.</p>
<p>The next day, while I was at school teaching, my wife pawned her only cotton robe and redeemed my cotton robe. The money was not enough, so she borrowed from the sister-in-law upstairs. When I came back, I saw her wearing a jacket and blouse, and doubts arose in my heart. My nose felt sour, and I remained silent. She had already taken the cotton robe for me to put on.</p>
<p>After she put it on for me, feeling a little warmer, she comforted me and wiped away my tears, touching her cold fingers, my tears welled up even more.</p>
<p>The oil pressing queue snaked through the streets. A ruthless whip fell on people's heads, and a burst of screams shook the queue. How difficult it is to continue life! I wanted to lower my head and not look at the reality in front of me, but a kind of inexplicable emotion gnawed at my heart.</p>
<p>Walking into the attic, turning on the light, preparing to grade some papers, reading the children's innocent and pure words, perfect ideals, living beautifully like in heaven, they have no filth and suffering.</p>
<p>Just as my thoughts flew over ten years, a heavy and slow footstep on the stairs awakened my memory. I have only walked twenty-seven years on the road of life, and the past happiness seems to have been decades ago.</p>
<p>What is present before my eyes is my wife's disheveled hair and two dull, lifeless eyes, putting down the empty bottle next to the bed, pressing one hand on her abdomen and falling onto the bed, murmuring:</p>
<p>"Ling! I'm in some pain..."</p>
<p>I was stunned. It's only been eight months. How can I cope? I stood there like a wooden chicken. My wife tugged at me...</p>
<p>Two inexperienced people stared at each other, looking at my wife's face. I counted the banknotes in my pocket, piecing together less than ten yuan. I helped my wife to lie down more comfortably and ran downstairs to the school...</p>
<p>Walking into the principal's office, the principal was reading the newspaper, looking at me sideways through his glasses, as if surprised, feeling that my arrival was abrupt. I opened my mouth but then shrank back. I remembered that I had already drawn two months' salary in advance. Finally, braving great courage, I opened my mouth:</p>
<p>"Principal, my wife is about to give birth. Please allow me to borrow two months' salary."</p>
<p>"Haven't you already drawn two months in advance? I think you know the school's financial situation very well. The price of salt rises with the sun, and you are already an exception, drawing two months in advance, and now..."</p>
<p>"When I came out, she was already in severe abdominal pain. Please help me especially, because I am really in a hurry..."</p>
<p>Seeing how anxious I was, he leisurely tapped the pencil on the cup a few times. I couldn't help but get angry and turned around to run out. He sneered behind me:</p>
<p>"Heh... Giving birth to a child is not easy..."</p>
<p>I heard him but didn't argue with him, and pleaded with Uncle Wang, the gatekeeper, explaining my urgent matter. He generously lent me twenty yuan, and I ran straight home as if flying.</p>
<p>Rushing upstairs, my wife was in even more severe pain. The sister-in-law upstairs was carrying an oil bottle and said to me directly:</p>
<p>"Sir, your wife injured herself pressing oil. You shouldn't have let her go. She is so pregnant. You men don't take care of women. It's the same with my man." She gestured and started giving medical advice, blaming the men. I could only say to my wife:</p>
<p>"I think I should ask a doctor to come and have a look first!"</p>
<p>My wife was in too much pain to respond. I went out without thinking, borrowed the neighbor's phone and called the obstetrics hospital.</p>
<p>The doctor came, and my wife screamed loudly in pain. After examining her, the doctor told me to prepare hot water. I looked at my wife and had to take the hot water bottle to make hot water. When I came back from the tiger stove, the door was closed. I heard my wife's groans, and then I heard a low and high-pitched sound. I knew that a small life had arrived in the suffering human world...</p>
<p>At noon, I went home and walked into the attic. My wife was breastfeeding the baby. The baby was very small, and the two small eyes were very bright, desperately sucking on the nipple. The scarcity of milk made the mother even more painful. My wife frowned and looked at the little thing. I kissed him with pity. My wife was afraid of making him cry and pushed me away. I asked my wife:</p>
<p>"Can milk powder be fed to him?"</p>
<p>"I think I should eat and drink more, and the milk will be more plentiful!" I felt a surge of love and warmth from being a mother, warming my heart.</p>
<p>Taking the rice jar to cook porridge, there was not enough rice for even one meal of porridge. I secretly took it to cook it, letting my wife eat more, and I only drank half a bowl of porridge soup. My wife asked me if I was full, and I said I was full.</p>
<p>Some friends generously helped me find ways to get money and bought rice and vegetables for my wife to eat. My wife is very clean. The sister-in-law upstairs often helped her wash some dirty clothes, but she had many children, so my wife felt bad and secretly washed them herself without telling me.</p>
<p>Once, twice, she caught a cold, got sick, and had a high fever again. The sister-in-law upstairs saw me and warned me:</p>
<p>"Sir! A fever is not good for your wife. Be careful!"</p>
<p>I tried desperately to borrow money to ask a doctor to examine her, but doctor's fees and medicine seemed to be the exclusive property of the rich, and we had no share. Heavens! How wide is the distance between life and death? (Proceeds will be used for scholarship aid)</p>

<h3>Review of "The Simpleton's Love History"</h3>
<p>— Liu Chang</p>
<p>Just looking at the silly appearance of Wang Er (the protagonist of the film) wearing tortoiseshell glasses reminds one of Roscoe Arbuckle. And "The Simpleton's Love History" is indeed a slapstick comedy with a Roscoe Arbuckle flavor.</p>
<p>The story tells of Sugiyama Fumio, who, following his mother's words, takes his first ancestor Sugiyama Daisaku as a model, and wholeheartedly wants to relive the ancestor's experiences today. However, the past is the past. How can such things be recreated now? So he, like Don Quixote, suffered a lot of ridicule and mockery. However, the fool has his own luck, and he actually survives in desperate situations, gains advantages everywhere, and finally wins the favor of the daughter of the manager of a product company, and they set off together to Manchuria for an inspection trip.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the story is quite interesting. If the contrast between the past and the present can be emphasized, and many jokes can be unearthed in the middle, and then a romance is added, writing about the crowd's mockery of Sugiyama Fumio and the manager's daughter Hiroko's sincere love for him... In this way, it could become a satirical comedy, that is certain. However, after watching "The Simpleton's Love History," I feel that the screenwriter and director have failed such a good subject.</p>
<p>In film art, the "speed" and "consistency" of camera cuts are the first things to pay attention to. In terms of content and awareness of American films, don't worry about it first; at least, they pay very close attention to the grasp of emotions. That is to say, they are very good at understanding the tricks of taking the long and supplementing the short, simplifying the complex, and using jump-cut shots to tightly hold the audience's heartstrings from beginning to end. In this way, it often makes old ladies who are not used to watching movies feel as if they have fallen into a fog of five miles, feeling inexplicable, but more importantly, it fully demonstrates the characteristics of modern film art.</p>
<p>"The Simpleton's Love History" is not very sufficient in these points. According to the overall count, there are no less than four or five battle scenes in this film, each lasting no less than seven or eight minutes, so half of the film is taken up. In old novels, when Zhang Fei met Ma Chao, they fought one round after another, and the author could follow along and describe one round after another. But in movies, this is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>On the contrary, some places make people feel too hasty. Perhaps because unnecessary descriptions take up too much space, many shots can only see some figures wriggling, someone goes out, someone comes in, like a revolving lantern, letting the director control the plot. When the plot is over, the movie is over. But the strength of a slapstick comedy is definitely not in narrating the plot. It should use many concrete actions, tones, deeds... to create jokes and move the audience.</p>
<p>Also, since the story contrasts ancient and modern times, then, obviously, the ancient part should occupy less space, and the modern part should occupy more, and the two should be organically linked together. Although this film also pays attention to this point, I think the ancient part can still be largely deleted. On the contrary, more shots of Sugiyama Fumio and Hiroko falling in love should be added. (Hiroko has almost no scenes in the film).</p>
<p>There is also a small flaw, that is, the section where he dreams of catching thieves later. Dreaming easily makes people suspect that it is real. The director does not seem to have treated the dream world and reality differently.</p>
<p>In short, "The Simpleton's Love History" is a work worth watching. But to criticize it seriously, there are still many uneven and uneven places, and the director is asked to pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Seeking a Full Meal in Winter</h3>
<p>— Jing Bao Ke</p>
<h3>The Teacher</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(10) (1)</p>
<p>All the above passed through his mind in a moment of protest and anger, but he didn't say a word of it. He only straightened his tattered robe and walked away a few steps, "Ahem—ahem." He had argued enough. At the door, he turned around and said: "I—ahem—don't want to resign—you do—ahem—what you want with the matter!"</p>
<p>Chips turned to look back at that scene of more than twenty years ago, and couldn't help feeling a little sorry for Alston in his heart. Especially because Ralston had no idea what forces he was dealing with. Even Chips himself was like that regarding this matter. Neither of them correctly estimated the strength of the Brookfield tradition, and its determination to protect itself and its protectors. Because things happened by chance: that morning, there was a student waiting to see Ralston, and he happened to hear all the conversation between the two of them inside outside the door; he was of course very nervous when he heard these words, and told his friends. Some of them, in a surprisingly short period of time, told their parents: therefore, soon everyone knew that Ralston had insulted Chips and asked Chips to resign. The result of this development was a surge of sympathy and bias that Chips had never dreamed of in advance. He felt it was simply shocking that Ralston had completely lost people's hearts; he was respected and feared, but not liked; in this matter of Chips, his being disliked even exceeded his being respected and feared. Some people were talking about that if Ralston really drove Chips away, there would inevitably be a disturbance in the school. Many of the teachers in the school were young people, who usually thought that Chips was unbearably old-fashioned, but now they also supported him, because they hated Ralston's kind of driving slave thorns and saw in this old teacher a style of not fearing the strong. One day, Sir John Rivers, the chairman of the board of directors, visited Brookfiled without notifying Ralston and went directly to Chips' place. (29)</p>
<h3>A Few Words</h3>
<p>— Yi Wen</p>
<p>If I could be reborn, I would practice patience and never be hindered by difficulties.</p>
<p>The result of patience can match genius, as the saying goes: "There are only two creatures that can surpass the pyramids (that is, do difficult work), namely, eagles and snails (referring to talented people and patient people)."</p>
<p>If I could be reborn, I would cultivate courage, for courage is the most kind and weakness is the most cruel in the world (the courageous have a small heart, while the cowardly bully the weak).</p>
<p>If I could be reborn, I would always be optimistic, life is like a mirror, if you laugh at it, it also laughs at you; if you frown at it, it also repays you in the same way.</p>
<p>Inner joy not only warms yourself, but this warmth will also enter the people we come into contact with. (Returns a reward) Social Service</p>
<h3>Reader's Letter Launches Spring Festival One Yuan Charity Movement</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The weather has suddenly turned cold in the past few days. When I sleep at night, I cover myself with two quilts and still complain about being cold! But looking back at the homeless men, women, old and young people on the streets, not only do they have no home to return to, but they also don't even have three meals a day. Then, if this continues, won't they just be heading towards the road to death? We are all human beings and should love others. We cannot watch our poor compatriots suffer from hunger and cold, and even die on the roadside. In this chaotic world, we should bring out our conscience and do some relief work. I think your newspaper, with the purpose of serving society, will definitely be happy to launch it!</p>
<p>Now I have proposed a method, which is that during the Spring Festival period, enthusiastic staff members from various stores will voluntarily save money and donate. As for the amount of the donation, each person only needs to donate one yuan. If the store has a population of ten people, then ten yuan will be donated. After this donation is automatically collected, it will be handed over to your newspaper for safekeeping, and then your newspaper will forward it to charitable organizations. After the charitable organizations receive it, they will hold charity events such as distributing porridge and clothes. I think that such a method is only a small expense for the donors, but it is a great gospel for the general compatriots in distress! At the same time, it is also the benefactors creating boundless blessings. The above is just my humble opinion, and I hope your newspaper will further solicit donations. I am also a store employee, and I would like to donate five yuan first as a prelude. Sincerely, the initiator, Anonymous</p>
