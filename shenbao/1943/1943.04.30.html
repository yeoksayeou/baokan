<p>社評</p>
<h3>論東亞新局勢</h3>
<p>日本內閣此次人事調動中，最值得重視的，就是駐華大使重光葵氏之調任外相一事。因爲日本政府是目前推動東亞政局唯一的重心，而日本外務省則負有日本推動對外關係的責任。因此，外相之更動，與東亞局勢之推移，自有密切的關係。</p>
<p>自大東亞省設立以后，外相一職，先由東條首相兼攝，其后則由東鄉專任，自東鄉告辭，即由谷正之繼任，以迄於今次之更動，目前大東亞圈內之外交事項，大部分劃歸大東亞省辦理，而外務省管轄者，僅限於以德·意·蘇爲中心之外交事項。但因一般情勢之限制，事實上外交事務，反不如大東亞省之繁重。所以，外相一職，其重要性較前似稍遜減。</p>
<p>然而，此次日本外相之更動，是以負有現實主義外交官盛名之駐華大使重光氏調任，這一點，便是我們想加討論的。同時，也就是可以理解東亞新局勢的一個關鍵。</p>
<p>首先，浮在吾人腦際的疑問，便是重光氏充任外相以後之外相一職，其職權與事務，是否與從前一樣？可是，依照目前推移中的各種情勢，加以觀察，其職權與事務定必較前繁重。因此，重光氏充任外相是給予吾人一個很明顯的啓示：就是：「日本外相一職，已經不是像最近一個時期的輕簡」了。</p>
<p>從日本方面說，蘇聯與英美的關係，德蘇戰局前途，以及其他世界情勢所引起的日本對外關係之種種，這裏不能深長讨論，但是歸結一句，日本政府此後對德蘇外交是極其微妙而且重要的。尤其是對蘇外交，自然會牽連到英美兩國，而在中國和南太平洋戰綫上的戰事，及其他政治上，也都有息息相通的關係。因此，外相必須熟悉中國情勢，兼須理解蘇聯，德國，和英美各國政情，在此錯綜複雜之中，對於各方面引起的情勢，必須具有冷靜而正確的判斷，去實行着一種最現實性的外交政策。在這種種條件要求之下，重光氏無疑是最爲適當者，我們認爲這是此次調用重光氏爲外相的最主要的原因。</p>
<p>其次，從我國方面說，根據上面所說的理由，日本之對華外交已需要和德蘇及其他各國外交並行考慮配合進行，所以，日本此後之對華外交的重心，已從南京移到東京，而再從東京響應到國際，這個認識是非常重要而不容忽略的。換句話說，雖然是客觀情勢使然，但是從此我國政府又增强了國際上的地位。這也值得重視的。</p>
<p>根據上面種種分析，我們可以斷定大東亞戰爭，業已從軍事作戰的階段，步入政治，外交，軍事，經濟等等之綜合性的新階段。換句話說，就是站在過去日本所制勝的路綫上，去實行着更複雜而具有持久性的綜合戰爭的新階段。而國民政府的地位，也因之進一步成爲國際上更重要的一員。</p>
<p>我們必須認清當前東亞的新局勢，積極起來協助政府，督促政府，使其有能力負起這更復雜的新階段的任務，協助日本完遂大東亞的解放戰爭的勝利。</p>
<h3>歡迎谷大使并歡送蔡大使</h3>
<p>東亞新形勢的　展，要求中日兩國更密切的合作，集中兩國全部的力量，準備在未來決戰中獲得最後的勝利，迎接東亞的黎明。中日兩國這種新的使命之實踐，固有賴于兩國國民之共同奮鬥，而如何雙方一心一德，互諒互助，以完成使命，首先不期待於兩國當局，尤其是兩國大使之努力。</p>
<p>中日兩國邦交，自我國參戰以來，已有更友好的發展，特別是日本對華政策之轉變，以撤廢洽外法權及交還租界爲契機，向名實相符的提携·互助·共建東亞新秩序之途邁進，我們在這裏，對於友邦政府當局之　明與國策之正確，以及前任駐華大使最近轉任外務大臣的重光氏之努力奮鬥，表示敬意。尤其重光氏對於我國民族解放運動之同情愛護，不僅在中國政界，而且特別在我民間，永留有光輝不滅的印象。自重光大使榮昇外相以來，我國民間對於新大使人選之關切與期待之殷，實不亞於我們的政府當局，而今日佳音東來，竟是我國朝野已久欽敬的前任外相谷正之氏，轉任駐華大使，我們真有不勝榮幸之感。</p>
<p>谷大使服務日本外交界　三十年，特別是對於我國，向有理解與同情，我們深信谷大使必能繼前青木顧問與重光大使而進一步加强中日協力，及早完成大東亞戰爭之使命，宣稱「帝國爲適應新事態，以協助國府，强化政治力爲目的，斷然實行撤廢在華治外法權，交還租界，中國百年夙願之主權完整，已得完成。中日兩國之共存共榮，亦因此而　向本然之軌道，今後我國之澈底實行此新政策，實已無待贅言，此在建設大東亞新秩序上，實有極　意義。故其結果，影響於大東亞各民族以至全世界者，誠難估計」。谷大使更針對目前大局而特別指出，「余此次拜受大命，必以前綫將士之志爲志，深體政府方針，挺身於中日携之强化。」據此更可　期今後谷大使必將努力促進中日兩國之總合，以爭取戰爭之最後勝利。對於東亞前途，一定有非常重大的影響。</p>
<p>在歡迎谷大使早日蒞任之際，我國新任駐日大使蔡培氏，亦已完畢其視察華北參戰後各方面新情勢之使命而返京，不日卽將東渡履任。在此中日友善關係飛　進展之新時代，我們對於蔡大使，具有同樣的熱烈期待。蔡大使對於國際情勢，對於日本地位之認識，無待我們爲之誇耀，將來對於促進中日友善關係之努力，我們在此預　歡送之詞，首先希望蔡大使多多反映我國民間的實際情况，特別是隨時向日本民間多多反映我國民眾之情緒與理想，使中日兩大民族之結合，不僅限於戰爭期間，而延亘至於無盡之將來；不僅於兩國政府或政界，而擴展到各階層的民間，不僅限於政治軍事與經濟，而滲透到文化與社會方面。因爲，只有這種切實的努力，才會鞏固中日真正的合作，才會以中日兩大民族之合作爲模範，進而建立東亞諸國的團結，建立東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>目前時局關係之重大，以及中日兩國在這時局中所負責任之艱鉅，決非普通言詞所能形容周至：因此，現階段的中日國交，決不是普通的國際關係可比，中日兩國在此共患難的新意義上，所謂外交，具有更深長的意義，任何一方面，都不能像英美外交家一樣，站在自私自利的出發點，玩弄其外交的手腕。中日兩國今日迫切需求的，不再是普通所謂「敦睦邦交」，「折　撙俎」，不再是一般的外交工作；事實上需求於雙方使節的，必須是對於國際大局與兩國使命之全面的認清，必須是對於中日兩國一體關係之深刻的了解，必須是對於對方國策與要求具有切實的體諒與同情，日本必須完全了解中國民族求取獨立自由之正當要求而切實予以扶助，不僅着眼於片面的一時的利益。中國也應澈底體察大東亞戰爭的意義，而盡最大的努力，以協助日本。而兩國使節就必須對此作最大的努力，與各駐在國的政府，尤其是對方的人民密切合作，力排萬難，披荊斬棘，以完成其使命。我們於摯誠迎送之際，願東亞黎明之曙光，追隨兩　大使而早日普照於太平洋之全域。</p>

<h3>日本慶祝天長節　東京舉行閱兵典禮　葉蓬參加後發表談話</h3>

<h3>褚外長返抵首都　歸國前發表訪日感想</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　國府外交部長褚民誼氏，前代表我國出席日本第三屆東亞醫學大會，復以國府特派大使資格，奉呈我國贈與日本天皇之同元大勳章，頃以任務已畢，於二十八日乘機飛抵上海，二十九日下午褚部長轉搭京滬快車於當晚九時二十分返抵南京。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　中華民國政府外交部長褚民誼氏，於廿八日離此返國以前，曾應日本記者之請，發表此行感想。茲録大意如次：「此次本人重來東京，幾將兼句，最初本以醫師資格，率領中國代表前來出席東亞醫學大會，並擬以文化人之立塲，就中日文化之溝通問題，與日本朝野各界商討。後復奉本國政府之命，派爲贈勳專使，得將本國進贈天皇陛下之同光大勳章捧呈御前。茲以事畢返國，略述感懷如次：本人在駐日大使任內，並去年以專使資格訪日，客臘又隨汪主席來訪，屢蒙貴國皇室之優遇及朝野之歡迎，衷心感激非可言宣。此次國府爲酬答貴國政府三年來熱誠之援助，特以同光大勳章贈天皇陛下，藉表本國政府感謝之忱。本人又重蒙皇室優渥之待遇，實爲無上之光榮。此次東亞醫學大會第二屆大會，得躬逢其盛，與東亞各地醫學界代表相見，對於促進東亞醫學之發達，各抒高見。本人亦曾就太極操與健康問題有所闡述，如此互相切磋，彼此研討，於東亞醫學之發展必有裨益。日本自輸入西洋醫學學理以來，僅數十年間，經無數日本學者之潛心研究，鈎精發微，並力求其普及，已獨樹一幟，大放異彩。於疾病之療治，國民之保健，有完美之設備，周密之制度，足爲中國所效法。本人在駐日大使任內，曾參觀帝大醫院，此次得有機會，參觀慶應大學之醫院，深　其設備之完善，將來爲求中國醫學之發展，必須取法日本以資借鏡。前在南京，曾爲日本高森部隊發表三藏法師之項骨案，三藏法師於中國佛敎之傳播與發達，厥功甚偉，而佛敎之直接流入日本，又始於唐代，故三藏法師於日本佛敎之流傳亦殊有功績。此次無意中，於南京發現其項骨，擬爲建塔俾垂之久遠，本人因此曾舉行茶會，招待佛敎及文化各界，共襄盛舉。幸得日本人士之熱心贊助，將來骨塔完成，爲中日兩國佛敎信徒共資瞻仰，亦爲兩國佛敎交流之徵象。佛敎因三藏法師之介紹，始廣流傳，其所譯經文，實於中國佛敎有偉大功績。其後佛敎流入日本，又自成流派甚多，益放異彩，對於日本之文化影響殊大。今後爲求中日兩國佛敎之愈益發揮，實有賴於兩國佛敎信徒之合作。此次又得於湯島聖堂參預祭孔盛典，孔敎之流傳於日本甚久，而系統的介紹與傳習則始於唐代，於日本之政敎文物與論理影響甚大，至今日本人士尊孔不衰。中國自近數十年來，以全盤接受西洋文化，於外來學說不加選擇，不經消化，無條件接受，視孔敎爲敝屣，甚者視孔敎如寇　，以至佛理觀念，社會秩序大爲紊亂，而過去之中心思想亦根本推翻，造成今日思想混亂之局面。今後欲重建東亞新秩序，宜以孔敎爲中心思想，而愈益發揮　　道義精神。最近國民政府對於孔學規於春秋二祭，隆重舉行，實亦由此。本人此次渡日，爲時兼旬，最初因以工程師資格前來，於各方多所接觸，本人深爲感佩者，即日本全國上下精神之淬礪，與決心之堅決，各就本位努力不懈，此足爲勝利之保證。國民政府自參戰以來，對於擊滅英美，實具堅强之決意，誓必盡所有之力量，與日本携手邁進，以謀戰爭之完遂。此次目擊日本國民精神之强毅，工作之緊張，尤以對戰爭信心之堅定，本人深爲感動。此次歸國，當將日本國民之熱誠與決意，傳達本國人民，使益加奮發，益加勉勵，以貫澈戰爭之目的。關於中日提携，曾與日本要路諸公開誠商討。日本對華新政策，現已由理論而進入實踐之階段。最近日本政府毅然自動的交還租界與撤廢治外法權，使中國能自主發展，我全國上下實感荷不已。今後益當努力，以貫澈此種方針。同時中國亦必益加奮勉，以謀復興，俾能有充分之力量，以分擔建設東亞新秩序之職責也。</p>
<h3>新任駐日大使蔡培由平返京</h3>
<p>南京廿九日中央社電　我國新任駐日大使蔡培氏，以出國履新在即，特於本月廿八日由京赴平，視察華北情况，並向當地各機關辭行。茲已公畢，於廿八日由平乘機返京，臨時因天時關係，中途滯留徐州，故於廿九日下午一時，由徐州乘車返抵南京。</p>
<h3>太行山脈日軍完成一大包圍戰　渝軍長司令均包圍　日機協力追擊渝殘軍</h3>
<p>北京廿九日中央社電　南部太行山脈日軍精銳部隊，二十八日已完成包圍洄川南鄕二十五公里之奪火鎭，查該地乃渝直系劉進部下之第二十七軍。二十九日上午〇時，在前綫日軍將士，遙向東方參拜天長節，並高呼萬歲，最後又一致對渝軍加以總攻，包圍渝軍於東姚集巴地俘獲渝軍總司令龐炳勛等之日軍精銳，亦於是日晨開始猛攻。</p>
<p>東京廿九日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境前綫二十九日電，日軍南進部隊二十九日晨於東姚集山岳地帶，對渝第四十集團軍開始總攻，於空陸軍之協力下，隨處展開山岳戰，渝軍總司令龐炳勳及第四十軍司令馬法吾均被包圍。又遭日軍挾攻之渝軍劉進部下之第二十七軍主力之退路已全被切斷，故不日亦將遭殲滅。</p>

<h3>五五靑年節　林宣長朂勉靑少年</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　新國民運動促進委員會林秘書長，爲五五靑年節發表談話，全文如左：</p>
<p>國民政府還都三週年紀念，中國靑少年團第一次總檢閱之時，各地同志，建議規定靑年節日，用意至善，當呈報領袖，深蒙嘉納，經於本日最高國防會議議決，以每年五月五日爲靑年節。茲臨第一屆靑年節之期，願舉左列五點，與我靑少年同志共勉之。</p>
<p>（一）雙四爲兒童節，雙六爲敎師節，雙五爲國父就職　常大總統紀念日，（民國十年雙十節國慶紀念日）今定雙五爲靑年節，事非巧合，益有深意存焉。吾人於此，當認識中華民國艱難締造之經過，尤當深切認識國父歷年領導靑年賡續革命，前仆後繼，與反動勢力搏鬥之精神。十年前之雙十，賴十年後之雙五而重見光輝；（廿二）年後之雙五，更應繼承（廿二）年前雙五之革命精神；使今後之雙十，永爲中華民國光輝燦爛之國慶紀念。</p>
<p>（二）完遂大東亞戰爭爲當前第一任務，亦爲興復中華保衛東亞第一要着。國家之興亡，取決於靑少年之精神與力量；戰爭之勝負，亦取決於靑少年之力量。當此大東亞戰爭勝利展開，中日友好關係日益增進，中國於多年災難之餘，經殊死之鬥爭，方得以掙脫百年來侵略主義之束縛之際，舉行第一屆靑年節，凡我靑少年同志，務須淬勵奮發，集中一切精神與力量，以求戰爭之完遂。由鍛鍊一己之精神與力量，充實全國靑少年之精神與力量，進而團結束亞靑少年之精神與力量，使我之精神與力量隨時隨地足以克制敵人之精神與力量，粉碎敵人，爭取勝利，端賴於此；中國前途，東亞前途，亦繫於此。</p>
<p>（三）靑年節之規定，在使全國靑少年，每年一度，提高其勇猛精進刻苦耐勞之朝氣。與勇氣。每年此日，應檢討過去之工作，認識責任之重大，於深切反省與自我批評中，激發其以後一年之努力。</p>
<p>（四）領袖倡導新國民運動，以建立自己，勗　國人，必人人能建立自己，乃　有所貢獻於國家之建立，亦必中國能建立自己，乃能有所貢獻於東亞之建立。我靑年同志奉行領袖訓示，當　此四字，用作新國民運動之座右銘。每年靑年節尤當以此爲檢討過去，策動將來之準繩，處處發揮建立自己之精神，並且不斷充實此精神。</p>
<p>（五）我國靑年運動曾有過蓬勃之發展，然或則空洞散　，始而浮囂，繼而消沉，或則派別分歧，相　　殘，因之個人之知能無由充實，集體之力量，無由發揮，國家民族以至東亞大局，並受其害。今後當以靑年節產全國靑少年信仰一致，行動一致之表徵，堅固其團結益增其力量，以救中國，以保東亞。</p>

<h3>德克兩領袖會晤　重申共同作戰決心</h3>
<p>德元首行營廿八日中央社電　今日官方公佈：德元首昨日接見克羅地領袖巴維里樞於其行營，此爲德義兩領袖會議後，第四次與中歐軸心集團領袖之會晤。兩氏之討論集中於軸心國共同反抗過激主義與英美民治主義之政治及軍事局勢。同時列席者有德外長里賓特羅甫·克羅地外長布達克·季台爾元帥及畢里奧將軍。會晤時充分表現德國與克羅地間之融洽友誼。巴氏曾鄭重申明克羅地人民之決心擁護自由，並以全力達到最後勝利之目的慶美軍總司令斯蒂威爾中將與。按　四月七日德元首與義首相會晤以來，希特勒曾分別與羅馬尼亞總理安托納斯古·匈攝政霍爾第·及斯洛伐克總統蒂梭相晤，而義相墨索里尼亦與匈牙利總理凱萊會晤於羅馬</p>

<h3>倫敦華盛頓密切聯絡　企圖促成蘇波修好　英政策顯有迎合莫斯科傾向　薛柯斯基政府或將實行改組</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　倫敦每日郵報外交特派員今晨稱：英首相邱古爾曾與羅斯福總統在電話中談論蘇波政府絕交之事，於此可見蘇外長莫洛托夫致薛柯斯基之牒文所引起之疑慮。華盛頓方面對於此次危機，抱極爲保留之態度。但美駐波公使畢特爾最近與波總理會談數次。華盛頓之政治觀察家認爲此乃表明美國對於此次事件，有繁張之外交活動。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：從此間所接獲之倫教消息，皆可顯見英國之政策，有完全放棄倫敦波蘭流亡政府，以迎合莫斯科之傾向。自英國報紙於星期二建議改組波蘭政府以使蘇波復交後，昨晨倫敦方面對於波蘭現政府之同情，顯巳達到零度。政界方面認爲此項發展之原因，乃由於蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基曾向邱吉爾首相及艾登外相確切表示，蘇政府無如何，絕不放棄其現時之立塲。至於希望仍能獲得某項協議者，乃係預期波政府將辭職，面由非反蘇份子所組織之政府以代之。因此在過去二十四小時中，英國人士之反對薛柯斯基政府運動漸形重要。倫敦泰唔士報昨日表徵英國對於蘇波衝突所抱政策之主要原則，謂邱吉兩及艾登完全瞭解英蘇之間，需要最密切之信任，是誠足嘉云。政界方面從此項辭句中，推斷英國政府將向波政府通知，爲求倫敦與莫斯科間之密切諒解，英國政府將不復能與波政府以協助。交換電訊亦評論此問題，並使用蘇聯政府所有之論據，甚至謂紅軍對於波蘭之解放極有貢獻，並不計及蘇聯對於波蘭所有之土地要求。交換電訊又指摘波政府之縱容其報紙對於未來之邊界問題。常予蘇聯以刺激，曾謂此等文字之作者係不負責任，又謂波政府並未阻止此項文宇之發表。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　據海通社外交特派員稱，蘇聯方面早已設有波蘭共黨委員會，原冀使之與倫敦之波蘭流亡政府相頡抗，此種時機現時顯已到臨，此爲蘇聯政府輿波政府絕交後，對英國施用壓力之主要方法。華盛頓方面之希望蘇波僅係中止而非斷絕關係，實屬妄想。蓋此事已可從莫斯科致送與波領袖之英文牒文詞句中證實之倫敦方面正設法要求波蘭改組其政府，以冀覓得解決之辦法。但如此則波蘭或將有三個政府，一在莫期科，一在倫敦，而薛柯斯基之政府將在他處另設總部。但無論如何，英國決不任其歐洲政策繼續不能完成，亦不任其與莫斯科之聯繫受有威脅也。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　據可靠方面消息，蘇聯政府曾再三計劃集合僑居蘇聯之波蘭共產主義橋民組織委員會，以推翻薛柯斯基所主持之波蘭政府。此次復乘蘇波國交趨惡化之機會，立即成立該委員會。又悉該委員會已決定派委員瓦西冽夫女作家赴倫敦活動。</p>
<p>羅馬二十九日中央社電　法西斯報昨日載稱：傳薛柯斯基將軍已決定將波蘭流亡政府遷移至華盛頓。據悉，僅在英國承認傳已在組織中之波蘭親蘇新政府時，此項遷移方致實現。</p>
<h3>波蘭政府發表文告　駁覆蘇聯所加指摘</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據倫敦消息：倫敦波蘭流亡政府，昨日晚發表一文吿，駁覆蘇外長莫洛托夫所稱薛柯斯基係與德方合作，並暗示波政府欲在某種條件之下，與蘇聯恢復正常關係。據路透社外交特派員所悉，如蘇聯政府着手辦理撤回仍留蘇境之波蘭婦孺及舊日軍人之問題，則波蘭政府準備不再以波蘭失踪軍官之事，作爲政治問題。文吿之內容，係經波政府昨晚特別會議時所一致通過者，其措辭經審愼參酌，對蘇聯之絕交牒文，作間接之答覆。名義上係經由報紙而昭吿全世界，並將由報紙而致達蘇政府，一如蘇方牒文之係經由報紙而致達波政府者。　波駐蘇大使困蘇牒文中，會指波政府與德國默契而拒絕收受，據波蘭方面之意見，以爲牒文之內容，乃係積極的獻議，使蘇波兩國釋嫌修好。文吿故意避免提及波政府之請求國際紅會調查德方所指摘蘇聯於一九四〇年在斯摩倫斯克附近屠殺波軍官一萬二千人之事件，路透針記者據此而認爲此事之全部，巴吿壽終正寢，波蘭之文吿，亦未提及蘇聯之絕交事，此蓋暗示如蘇聯政府答覆波蘭關於留蘇波人之要求，則絕交事將作爲往事不提。波蘭之宣言，誠如前此所預期，駁覆蘇聯之指摘，波政府與德國合作，並否認對蘇聯土地有任何要求。路透社記者稱，「此文吿顯然將使預期波蘭政府突然翻臉之輩，感覺失望。蘇政府之反應如何，現尙未知，但英美政府必將繼續聯合在倫敦華盛頓及莫斯科方一面不斷努力，使兩國修好，波政府文將文吿之原原文，電致其駐蘇大使羅瑪。</p>
<h3>英政府對波施壓力　緩和盟國分裂危機</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿九日中央社電　英政府曾於本月廿七日召關緊急閣議，協義蘇波國交惡化之對策。翌日邱吉爾及艾登復與波蘭亡命政權總理薛柯斯基及外長拉英斯基等協議。英政府始終主張與美政府取得聯絡後，抑制波蘭亡命政府，以緩和反軸心國間之危機。據消息靈通方面稱，英政府似圖（一）改組波蘭亡命政府，更進一步促薛柯斯基下野；（二）使波蘭亡命政府撤消要求日內瓦萬國紅會調查殘殺將士眞相之申請書，（三）蘭放棄收復失地之要求等，以壓制波蘭亡命政府。又據英國內各報廿七日一致載輪，指出波蘭亡命政府巳爲德宣傳所欺。英政府爲防止各國言論剌戟蘇聯政府，故會訓令各報自重，並眞重僉閱在英國之各國報紙特派員之消息。波蘭亡命政府本擬在廿七日召開閣議後，發表決定之强硬決議文，然常日並未發表，僅由發言人稱已發生新事態。迄廿八日夜始發表聲明，然該聲明極爲軟弱，與波蘭亡命政府以往之態度完全不同。其聲明之要指，爲（一）要求蘇聯政府對現僑居蘇聯領內之波蘭僑民得以自由，尤以對到達徵兵年齡之壯丁，於增強波蘭軍戰力上，乃爲絕對必要者；（二）波蘭政府始終傾全力保護波蘭共和國之完整，然對蘇聯領土並未提出任何要求；（三）波蘭政府切望與蘇聯有友好之諒解。關於喀坦森林事件巳向蘇大使提出通牒，然仍未接到任何消息</p>
<h3>突尼西亞仍激戰中　軸心陣地無甚變化</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員電稱：突尼西亞反軸心軍自於星期一開始大規模之調動後，迄今尙未就緒。英第八軍所守陣地，其主力似在遂漸移至左翼，該處敵軍自傑貝舉那區向彭杜法斯推進時，會遭遇軸心軍之堅强抵抗。又英第一軍在傑貝爾安格與傑貝爾曼索區之大隊集中地點，亦獲得英第八軍之大量增援，似仍圖進行其突破軸心軍陣地之計劃。同時安德森將軍於度積其攻勢之前，現正努力從事局部之突攻，以增進其陣地，其主要目的，似在攻佔彭杜法期。法叛軍會於上週末逐漸推進至傑貝爾曼索之東北地界，業於星期二日猛攻該城，但此項攻勢，已被阻於該城之西南，法叛軍雖損矢頗重，而昨晨又恢復其攻勞，英坦克車隊在柯爾西亞鑒湖之北獲得立足點後，顯然企圖支援步兵之進攻。反軸心軍在此處之壓力，仍頗强大，猛烈之攻勢，相繼不絕。梅傑茲埃爾巴勃以北，英軍巳於激戰後攻佔希杜斯小村，惟傑貝爾安裕現仍在　軍手中，美軍在北面作戰，昨日祇有不重要之收獲。賽拉角以東之沿海區域，軸心軍現仍與法叛軍激戰中。</p>
<h3>義王視察炸區</h3>
<p>羅馬廿九日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，據官方誠實，格羅托最近遭空襲之結果，共計死者一四五人，傷者二六八人，其中一百人傷勞頗輕，無須醫治，死傷之大半係屬婦孺，皆被英美機員自低空以機槍掃射而傷亡。義皇昨日偕其侍從武官長到達該城視察災區，並親自慰問受傷者，旋又訪問死難者家屬致唁。</p>
<h3>時事選譯　蘇波事件的餘波</h3>
<p>是文叙述因蘇波事件而引起反軸心集團間的同床異夢。按蘇職政府業已於四月二十六日由外交人民委員長莫洛托夫以通牒照會波蘭駐蘇大使羅瑪，宣佈蘇聯政府與波蘭政府斷絕國交。此舉更足以暴露反軸心國間之裂痕加深，而使英美左右爲難。</p>
<p>德蘇戰綫斯摩倫斯克附近的森林中，不意爲德軍發見波蘭將校無慮一萬餘名的屍骸，經德軍當局發表其爲蘇聯葛柏烏所殘殺後，已籲請國際紅十字會調查，俾因國際的調查，闡明眞相於全世界。此案的性質，實爲人類史上罕見的悲慘事件，同時以此案爲中心，使步調紊亂的反軸心陣營，暴露出新的破綻，也不能不爲注目。</p>
<p>適足爲德國方面的發表之證明的，爲反軸心陣營的一翼之波蘭亡命政權所提出關於此案的聲明書，然而在蘇聯方面，也巳出而否定德國方面的發表，同時把波蘭斷定爲支持德國的叛逆，極力責難波蘭亡命政權。</p>
<p>這個在國際法上，又在人類文化史上罕有的怪事件，其眞相自當有待於國際紅十字會仟命派遺的中立國專鬥家之公正的調查結果，然而社現下複雜的國際環境之下，從來採取着極爲愼重的態度之萬國紅十字會，終於受理這個問題，僅就這個事實看來，也可見此案的深刻和微妙了。</p>
<p>總之，此案的風波，旣巳使蘇波關係瀕於危殆，同時，使那把波蘭亡命政權以及其他一連串的亡命政權設置於倫敦，而担當着保護者的任務之英國，並以英國的繼承者自任的美國，對於其同盟國蘇聯的關係，巳發生了新的裂縫，是不可輕易看過的。</p>
<p>一九四一年德蘇開戰，蘇聯乃一變其向來對待波蘭的敵對態度，依着聯合全斯拉夫民族以和德意志民族成立民族戰爭形態的新政策，把同爲斯拉民族的波蘭民族，加以抱擁和支持。波蘭亡命政權的總理西哥爾斯基，曾接連二，三次，訪問蘇聯，甚至締結了蘇波同盟。那知這次由於波蘭亡命政權的要求　復失地，和蘇聯的堅主維持　蘇開戰前的國境錢，兩者之間，暴露了見解的懸殊，於是蘇波關係，便陷於對立。這事使蘇聯所揭燹之斯拉夫民族的大同團結，發生了龜裂，及於其他斯拉夫諸民族的影響，自屬很大，然而尤其甚者，即這個蘇波的糾紛，直接發展爲蘇聯和作爲波蘭亡命政權的後盾之英美的爭執，現實地暴露出反軸心陣營內步調的不一致。這個爭執因着英美的老猶，正要不了了之的當兒，不料現在竟又新發見了殘殺波蘭將校一萬餘名的慘案。這個問題不但使蘇波關係陷於危殆，進而更使蘇聯和英美的關係，發生暗影，對於這件怪案，尙未明確的英美態度，雖不能得而知之，但恐怕由於此案，其所呈現的，或是蘇英美的步調，更趨紊亂，或是叫賣「人道主義」的英美，因此而脫下其假面具。（丁：譯自四月二十五日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>敵方於印緬敗戰後　一片責難七辯聲</h3>
<p>在展開於緬甸西境阿拉干山麓的大殲滅戰中，日軍以其神策奇謀，布置包圍鐵環，造成了使敵英印軍三旅潰滅的大戰果。茲據情報，謂敵都倫敦的泰晤十報，紀事報，及其他各報等，一齊喊着「預定的退却」而記述如次頗有興味的敗因和今後之作戰動向；一方面，印度的「政治家報」，則以「請公布此次敗戰的眞相」爲題，發表社論，攻擊當局，暴露着種種混亂矛盾的醜狀。</p>
<p>敗戰的原因</p>
<p>（一）給　困難　阿拉干地帶，因爲有着許多叢林，沼澤，河浜等，縱橫交錯，而道路，橋梁，咸不完備之故，致給養因難，食物和彈藥，極感缺乏？反之，日本軍則控制馬酋河口，由阿恰布至唐卑克，拉鐵同，可以從容輸送物資。</p>
<p>（二）孟加拉灣的制海權和缺乏船舶攻奪阿恰布，應與攻擊仰光呼應而行，因爲攻奪仰光，是攻奪緬甸的最便捷徑。然而安達曼羣島的奪還，孟加拉灣制海權的確保，均因北非作戰，以致船舶不足，不能實現。</p>
<p>（三）日本軍的技術優秀　日軍在高地構築陣地，掘成許多堅固的塹壕，不接受英軍的反擊，而其擬裝隱蔽的本領，實在巧妙之至，使英軍屢屢誤算日軍的兵力。尤其可怕的，爲日軍的側面迂回，常出乎英軍意料，突然出現：英軍爲避免側面威脅，每作接連的後退。</p>
<p>（四）不能使出機械化兵器該處的地形，不適於英軍所擅長的機構化兵器的使用，尤其是坦克的使用，完全不可能。</p>
<p>（一）巳把緬甸日軍的防備，探察了一番。</p>
<p>（二）已得把攻擊根據地阿恰布的價値，加以中和。</p>
<p>（三）英軍在這次作戰中，己獲得了在叢林作戰上貴重的實戰經騐。</p>
<p>（四）把緬甸的日軍主力和西南太平洋的日本空軍力吸引到阿拉干，而得减輕日軍對於重慶及澳洲的壓力。</p>
<p>今後的英軍作戰</p>
<p>此次作戰，極似一八二四年的緬甸戰爭，英軍渡過納夫河而佔領孟格達烏後，由該處把兵力分爲二隊，一隊南下，一隊從布伊打格而向拉鐵打格前進，與南下軍呼應，俾自兩面攻奪阿恰布：然因日本軍的防衛周密，反而被巧妙的迂回滲透作戰所包國。不過此次退却，實是在季節風（Monsoon）即將到來前的「預定的退却」，在明年初頭，還要作大規模攻擊，現在則處於不能實行的狀態。</p>
<p>又關於此次的敗戰和即度的問題，印度的英文報，政治家報」，特發表社論，促謂當局公布眞相。這對於反對把印度用作作戰根據地，及反對使印度負担緬甸作戰戰費之國民會議派分子，提供了有以攻擊政府的好材料。一方面，此次英軍的敗戰，也使那做着車開滇緬公路的幻夢而遠遠地派兵到印度的重慶，於懊喪之餘，完全失掉了布置共同戰綫的魄力。（丁：譯自四月廿一日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>東京昭南鐵道的一環　浙贛路七年重通</h3>
<p>（杭州二十五日江幡特派員發）連結浙江省的首府杭州和要衝金華之浙贛錢，自中國事變以來，七年重通，已恢復了本來的姿態。金華與靜江江岸間一百七十六公里的鐵路，已於四月二十五日，在金華舉行盛大通車典禮，是日起，即開臺一般營業。該綫的工程，自着手後，僅經六月，即吿完成，創世界鐵道建設史上的新紀錄，在戰時下，其速率足與鐵道日本並誇。</p>
<p>這條鐵路，最初爲民國二十六年九月，由當時的浙江省主席張靜江興築，以杭州對岸的蕭山縣西興爲起點，經金華·玉山·而至南昌·萍鄕·築成蜿蜓六百公里的鐵路，旋因中國事變發生，蔣介石軍隊不堪日軍猛攻而敗走時，炸毀錢塘江大鐵橋，澈底破壞該鐵路而去。民國三十一年，由於浙東，浙贛二大作戰，日軍確保該地區後，鑒於浙贛終所負使命的重大，決定立即加以修復，爰即於作戰中的五月二十八日，命令華中鐵這公司組織調查隊，開始踏上了「邊戰邊建設」的第一步。當時該地方連日大雨，調查隊每日從事於深及胸際的濁流中。接着，作業隊也就開始在完全爲洪水所冲毀的路基上，揮着尖鋤，把敵人所遺棄的鐵軌，輔設起來。</p>
<p>作業係於十月開始，靠着作業隊諸人不分晝夜的努力，於十二月十三日，先修復了金華至湄池開一百三十四公里的一段，而開行輕列車，本年四月一日起，巳開始一般營業。餘下的湄池至靜江江岸四十二公里一段，雖在每日雨天之中，亦於四月廿四日，全部完成。是日，即於道條連結金華至杭州對岸靜江江岸一百七十六公里的鐵路上，試行重列車。用於該建設的經費，第一期與第二期合計爲〇〇〇萬日圓，使用工人苦力等，最多時母日一萬四千人，平均每日六千人</p>
<p>浙贛綫的恢復，在政治上及經濟上的意義，械爲重大。雖說同屬浙江省，而杭州及寗波方面，和浙江南部的內地方面，人口及文化程度，差異很大，浙贛綫當爲發展該地方文化的先驅吧。又在戰時下的今日，這條鐵路所具戰略的意義，當然很大，然而更重大的，則是其所負開發資源地帶浙贛地區的使命。該地區富於螢石，鎢等戰時下緊要的礦產資源，而農產，林產等亦很豐富。</p>
<p>浙贛綫是開發此等資源的動脈，也是連接上海，杭州等與內地物資交流的軀幹。金華，蘭谿，於該鐵路第一期完成以後，居民回來者已頗衆，物資的運出，亦漸增加。該鐵路與錢塘江並行，可以促進此等地力的物資與上海，杭州交流。又錢塘江大鐵橋的修築，預定於不久將來，可吿完成，一方面在金華與口口開的工程，亦在加緊進行。一俟此等工程完成後，資源地帶的浙贛地區，在新中國建設上，將担當着重大任務，自是殊堪注目；同時該綫成爲速結束京和昭南間大東亞鐵道的一環，其光榮發展之日，也是大可期待的（丁：譯自四月廿六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>昨日本報發報時間七點卅分</p>
<h3>經濟界　評言　扶植生產的貸款銀團</h3>
<p>我國生產落後，是無可諱言的。推進各地物產的主要工具，便在於金融界的生產貸款銀團。所以本攔於四月二十六日論「都市和農村資金的交流」，就主張積極辦理農業金融，以求糧食的增產。很可慶幸的是，財部當局昨已決定組織復興農村放款銀團，集中巨款，從事於農村低利貸放。無疑地，這是扶植農產的一個有力步驟。</p>
<p>可是，扶植生產這一句話，當然不止限於農業。工業與農業的貸款銀團，均同爲加緊生產的先決問題。由於農業貸款銀團的舉辦，我們希望國內的重要產業界，明白貸款銀團的重要性，隨時與金融界開誠洽商，促進此項組織，或以物品爲主體，或以事業爲目標。所以我們在四月十三日曾經寫了一篇「銀錢業與工業貸款。」</p>
<p>至於組織的辦法，不妨求其簡單，譬如以工業而論，在某業某公司某種物品上市時，可與銀錢界接洽需款數額，得隨時以所收產口爲抵押物，在一定額度內，由參加各行莊分擔；在此額度內，對銀團開具承兌滙票，經銀團承兌後，由某業某公司自己或售出商持向各組合行莊貼現；各組合銀行間，對於上述貼現如何支配數額，得由各行隨時斟酌情形決定之，並得介紹於組合以外的金融同業，承做貼現；貼現的利率，不宜過高，藉符扶植生產的本旨；同時，希望銀錢業聯合準備委員會允許將所執滙票作爲擔保品，照票面折扣，予以拆借劃頭的便利，更希望中央儲備銀行隨時許以重貼現的便利，以完成銀錢業幫助生產辦努力於生產事業的推展。</p>
<h3>經當局協助調整　各工廠恢復生產　現貨供應籌碼行將增加　南洋各地貿易亟待恢復</h3>
<p>本市各業工廠，一度呈滯呆現象，以致生產銷路兩者，均一落千丈。迨至前歲經當局積極協助，加以調整。對於原料之疏通，燃料之供給，曁生產量與推銷等諸問題。咸經議具妥全辦法，次第付諸實施，迄今各業大小工廠已漸呈活躍準狀態，工作恢復，生產增加，出口改良，均在長足進展中。</p>
<p>歸還各廠開工生產</p>
<p>昨息關於日軍之當局次第歸還之各業工廠除小部份早經先後恢復生產，大部份亦經各該廠主積極籌劃，目前均已在恢復開工生產，不久即可趨入正常狀態，加工出貨，屆時各種現貨供應籌碼，必將大量增加，但各該廠製貨所稀原料，尚有待當局之大量供給或疏通，否則不免稍感困難</p>
<p>南洋貿易亟待恢復</p>
<p>查本市各大小工廠所製造之物品，除供銷本市各公司，商號門市零星發售，及運往國內各地外，大部份向係運銷南洋各地，故南洋各地貿易之恢復及繁榮，攸關本市工商業之發展，工商界人士對於南洋貿易，遂亟盼設法恢復舊觀，旣可獲得大宗原料，又可將大量製成口源源運往推銷，據悉工業界領袖，曾經數度建議當局，及先後磋商善策。</p>
<h3>收回放款銀根吃緊　行莊業務淸淡</h3>
<p>本市金融業方面，自經當局論令禁止投機後，各小銀行及小錢運動服等自肅之結果，致其所營之業務，大爲淸淡，復因各大銀行收回放款之結果，致使若干，小銀行錢莊頗感銀根吃緊。</p>
<p>囤貨拋售　物價下跌</p>
<p>在銀根吃緊之情况下，一般資金短少之囤戶，致將其所囤之貨物，不得不略予拋售，因此連日有多種貨物如肥皂等之暗市價格均下跌一成餘，惟一般零售商人，則仍未將其另售物價壓低。</p>
<p>業務淸淡　合併改業</p>
<p>本市各小銀行因業務淸淡之故，爲適應環境起見，有合併之說，致一般規模較小之錢莊，則因軍票停止發行後，營業更爲淸淡，虹口竺幾家小錢莊，業已改營他業。</p>

<p>澈底澈查囤積，澈底懲處投機份子，是目前民衆一致的希望。然値此各方極力企盼整頓時期，而新開之銀行，錢莊，企業公司等，仍如雨後春筍般的設立，這是値得特別注意的一件事。</p>
<p>上次國府頒佈過禁止金融機關經商的命令，接着來過一條禁止新設金融機關的命令，但是命令公佈之後，居然還有　出的銀行公司，這些新開銀行，是否在政府頒命令以前已得到實業部的許可？或是憑藉何種特殊理由？竟不顧法令，使人莫明其妙。</p>
<p>自去年九月以後設立的企業公司，大多有投機的作用，它和特定銀行保持特殊的關係，作爲銀行的別動機關而活動，看到他們買寳華股的行爲，就可想見各種企業公司，都有囤積投機的危險性。</p>
<p>關於企業公司的數量，雖無明確統計，但是據租界某機關的估計，大小不下一千餘家，即以最低限度估計，亦在五百家以上。在推進新經濟政策的時期，原應獎勵設立足以促進復興工業生產的金融，商工機關，然而和工業生產不生關係的商業機關，以及僅爲表面上關係者，甚至爲毫無準備金的公司與普通的無關緊要的工廠，他們的開設，全是爲了投機獲利，姑不論其有無囤積情事，但如此濫設，實爲堪使注目之問題。（四月二十九日大陸新　）</p>

<h3>强化國府與囤積問題（一）</h3>
<p>囤積問題在政治上重要性，曾經反覆論述，吾人何以不厭求詳的提出此項問題，實在因爲囤積問題是阻礙國府政治，經濟，思想發展的最大障礙，這種問題，不能僅當作經濟問題或者技術問題隨　討論而解決的，乃是確立中國參戰體制的全面課題，必須循着加强國府，推進經濟新政的中日兩國旣定國策之綫而求其正當解決，才中肯綮。解決的關鍵，非常繁複，其中都有不可分的連帶關係，茲舉若干觀點如下：</p>
<p>第一：國民政府應如何解決此次之囤積問題，以加强國府威信。</p>
<p>第二：應以何種目光觀察中國的國家資本，與囤積問題之關係。</p>
<p>第三：純正三民主義，爲解決此項　題之基點，應如何求其發展。</p>
<p>第四：物價問題與生產問題，有何種關係，此項關係應如何予以解決。</p>
<p>第五：解決囤積問題，在對重慶政權的經濟戰上，有何意義。</p>
<p>第六：解決上海民族資本與囤積問題有何關係。中國的金融資本，產業資本，商業資本等與囤積問題又有何種關係。</p>
<p>第七：應如何强化全國商統會，以解決囤積問題。</p>
<p>第八：日本國民，是否應在客觀意義上促進解決此次囤積問題。</p>
<p>第九：對於囤積問題的言論，在中國現階段思想戰上，有何種意義。</p>
<p>第十：因囤積問題而引起與參戰後中國現實的間隙，應如何努力克服，用何種方法能更進一步完成理想。</p>
<p>除以上述各點之外，此　應該提出的問題正還多着。總之，因囤積而起的種種問題，就是國府本身的問題，上述各項觀點，所謂如何解決囤積問題，如何强化參戰下的國府，如何推行新政策，歸納起來，還不外爲一個問題。上面所述的相互關係均極重要，中日最高當局，應表示有效適當的理論與實踐毅力，更盼一般人對此要絕對信賴，才能促進中日兩國國民觀感，而能順利地解決此項問題，一切空論，無裨實益，是力須避免的。（雲鵬：譯自四月二十九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>學店·學生</h3>
<p>— 葉仁虎</p>
<p>「設科完備」，「時間仟擇」，「學額無多」，「報名從速」，「取費低廉」，「×月速成」，學店老闆大展手腕，招徠主顧，時間，經濟，成效，一切的一切，無不煞費苦心，爲未來的王顧們打算，眞是價廉物美，「色」，「香」，「味」俱佳。</p>
<p>開學了，招生的成績果然不差，敎室裏坐滿了男的，女的，胖的，瘦的，長長矮矮，來百不同的農生。有職業靑年，有日校學生，有動懇的苦學者，有竊其名而無其實者，……更有視學校爲其追逐異性的塲合者。</p>
<p>然而「學同」究不同商品，付了代價，茶不自己用心去研讀，縱使「速成」，結果還是得不到什麼。</p>
<p>漸漸的敎窒裏的人頭一天比一天的少下去，終於呈顯着稀零得可怕的景像，雖然，敎師仍是狗叫貓跳着。</p>
<p>學期已將及半，可是招生廣吿依舊是懸掛着，不過將「開學日期」和一學額無多一，改成爲「業已上課」，「餘額無多」吧了。</p>
<p>廣告的效力性倒底並沒有完全失去，有時三三兩兩地招來了幾位新主顧，不管是有連貫性或中途不能插入的課程。總之祗要有實繳，就可「　時插班，好在「設科完備」，此科不成，可改別科。要不是「退貨還洋」，「以貨　」，總得「通融」的呀！</p>
<p>學店老闆似乎頗識主顧心理的，接着使換上一套什麼「春季新班」，「速成特班」的外衣，於是敎室裏又　得仲不開脚來！</p>
<h3>猶豫</h3>
<p>— 維煥</p>
<p>個「優柔寡斷」的靑年，雖有着完美的理想，向前邁進的精神；但往往遭到小小的挫折之後，回憶別人　舊社會的俘虜——的「惡意批評」，社會的輕茂；就遲疑不決，讓「猶豫一盤桓於心靈。從此，俳徊　中，不　「再接再厲」，有所作爲，大好事業，就此「銷　匿跡」；徒給人畿笑，豈不可惜！</p>
<p>反之，一個「意志堅强」的靑年，雖遭到失敗，飽嘗世間的「冷嘲熱諷」，受盡「惡意批評」的攻擊，可是並不失望「猶豫」，仍本着「不屈不捷」大　畏的精神，不怕艱難向前邁進。抱負着再願「抑鬱不得志」，「齊恨以歿」的志氣。終於發明了「事物」，發現了「眞」，踏進「成功」的階級，這一種人才是我們「朝夕謳歌」的人。</p>
<p>因此，「猶豫」是「事業」的破壞者；是「人生」成功途上的荊棘，必須毀滅了「它」，「人生」是燦　光明的</p>
<p>「惡意的批評」，社會的「冷嘲熱諷」……這許多都是「惡劣環境」的一環，也就是「猶豫」的原動力，但我們總不能「因噎廢食」，嗔怪「環境」的惡劣，而拋秦了自己應負的實任，不努力「幹」，須知，現代世界是需要更多的「眞理』，更多的「事物」，使之燦爛，文明。</p>
<p>總之，現代世界上所需的乃是「意志堅强」「敢作敢爲」的人們，不是「優柔寡斷」「猶豫」的入們。所以，「猶豫」「徘徊於途中」的人們趕緊努力向前「幹」吧！爲世界多發明一件「事物」，多發現一條「眞理」，使世界更燦爛，更文明些。</p>
<h3>和諧與簡單</h3>
<p>— 惠人</p>
<p>美術家要求色彩配合的和諧：音樂家要求聲調節奏的和諧：我們的人生更要求生活進程的和諧。</p>
<p>生活的不和諧—憤怒，憂慮，據實騐的結果，極有損於人生的細胞，也就是說，生活的不和諧，便是在自戕生命，縮短自己生活的前程！</p>
<p>和諧的求取，第一個條件是簡單。圖案畫色彩的配合，常以同種色和反對色爲和諧。樂器音調的節奏，便以有規律的聲波爲和諧。我們生活的和諧，何嘗不可以到簡單的境界裏去探索？</p>
<p>現代的生活自然是複雜的。但是，複雜並不和簡單對立。雜亂才是簡單的敵人，複雜有了秩序，有了布置，統一起來，也便是簡單，而且，把複雜統一成的簡單，也是最圓滿的簡單，最美麗的簡單。</p>
<p>人們生活上的煩躁，不奪，便常是混亂所賜予的寳物。衣食的沒有决序，常引起愁悶的思緒，思想的躊躇猶豫，常引起苦痛的感觸，行走的漫無目的，常引起無聊的情調。驅逐了雜亂，趕走了混淆，煩躁和不寗也就溜跑了。</p>
<p>「生活簡單化」，確是含有至理的名言，生活愈簡單，生活的情調也愈和諧，要從生活的複雜萬端中找出頭緒來，抽出條理來，加以簡單的安置和處理：衣食住的國定生活，給他規律的融和，時間，地點都有了單一的定律。心靈上的思想，也得單純起來，志願是一個，希望是前後連貫，併合在一條路上，意志是堅決，任何的阻礙不能搖撼絲毫。於是圓滿在前途招手，成功在前途迎接，那裏會遭到憤，恨，怨，哀的侵襲！</p>
<h3>目的與方法</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>人生來就有「目的」。有了「目的」，也是因了「目的」，一個人才會去工作，吃飯，……做日常必須履行的事情。社會才會從原始茹毛飲血的時代蛻變至文化昌明的今日。世界才會被人描寫爲：如巨輪般的轉動。也許有誰以爲「目的」是自由的障礙物，因了「目的」，使我們不能自由自在地活動，隨意胡作亂爲。是的，高尙的「目的」是不允許這些事發生的。但，不良的「目的」根本就是企求這些，那我可不能很育定地說：「目的」絕對是自由的障礙。</p>
<p>「目的」旣定，一定得進行，設法臻致成功。因此，同樣是一個「目的」，可因各人智慧品格的不同，而產生許多不相類似的「方法」來進行。</p>
<p>一件偉大事業的成就，固値得我們大慶大賀，但亦得視成功的「方法」，才能決定它的價値。如果臻致的「方法」是骯髒卑鄙的，那麼，任這工作是如何如何的艱難，總是爲人所不齒的。反之，假使它的成功是不傷害他人的，是按步就班盡最大力量獲得的，那才能有它眞正的價値。</p>
<p>古人所謂：「一將功成萬骨枯」的成功，是要不得的。我們決不能把一二個人的銅像建築在千千萬萬同胞肝腦心血所塡築的基礎上。我們應該認識：這成功是屬於大衆的。</p>
<p>往往有人以爲：祇要求得成功，不管它是否用齷齪的手段去獲得的，這觀念是絕對錯誤的。</p>
<p>如果我們要得到眞正的成功，第一先要有高超的但不離現實環境的「目的」，其决需用最有效而並不妨害旁人的「方法」去進行。</p>
<h3>立定腳跟</h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>記小淸在那裏見過這樣一付對聯：「放開肚子吃飯，立定脚跟做人」。在這百物昂貴的今日，上聯已不合時宜了，但「立定脚跟」四字，却是做人顚撲不破的至理名言。</p>
<p>從遠大處說，古今來不少的科學家，革命家，探險家，……他們的事粱剛在着手的時候，往往被周圍一般目光淺近，囿於成見的庸俗之人，輕蔑嘲笑，甚至於唾駡非難，但是他們毫不畏怯，認淸目標，立定脚跟，用百折不撓的毅力，和堅決不移的信心，努力向前幹去，最後，終於成就了他們不朽的偉業。他們的姓名在人類史冊上佔了很重要的地位，輝煌千古！</p>
<p>從現近處說，目今社會上有一部份人，雖然他們收入甚爲菲薄，但能處處儉約，甘自淡泊，安步當車，薄粥代飯，無錢添製新衣，縫補也就將就，雖然周圍一般人都嘲笑他們，輕視他們，但他們並不淆惑於努利的目光，祇是立定脚跟，心安理得的繼續做去，所以雖然米珠薪桂，百物飛騰，倒也尙能勉强過去。反觀另一部份收入較豐的人，因爲趨奉社會的崇尙處榮，到處講究面子和排塲，衣必華服，食必錦繡，出外軍輛代步，在家僕人侍奉，在在以表示他們的　綽，結果入不敷出，債台高築，膽怯者便日坐愁城，憂急萬分；奸詐者便盜用公款，騙人財的，而結果身敗名裂，徒增了社會上罪惡的數字。</p>
<p>所以我們不論爲了事業，學問，或生活，隨時都應該牢記這四個字：「立定脚跟」。</p>
<h3>聽診器的發明</h3>
<p>— 高道</p>
<p>大家都看見過醫生時常把一對聽筒，按在病人的胸背等處，聽察從心肺裏發出的聲音，以斷定所患的病症。這對喇叭形的小東西，雖然很簡單，但是它的發明，却也藏　一段很有趣味的史話呢！</p>
<p>從心肺裏發出的聲音，因受了氣管支的阻礙和內臟雜聲的騷擾，往往令人在外聽不淸楚。婁內克（Laennee）在一八一九年己經見到聽診對於消病的重要。不過在試騐的時候，他就碰到了上述的困難。尤其是體胖的人，他心胸裏發出的機聲，一傳到外面，甚至都會消失。這樣的病人，婁內克也碰到過。他的理想，在實現之前，因此更加了一層陰影。可是在陰影的背後，却埋下了發明聽診器的種子。</p>
<p>有一天，婁內克看見一羣孩子在一堆木條上玩着，其中有一個把耳朶按在木條約一端，另一個站在他端，敲着本條。他們的信號就從木條中傳達過去。看見了這件事，婁內克的心機，頓然地被觸動了。他趕緊奔回醫院，把一本紙面的書，卷成圓往形。這就是有史以來第一個聽診器。</p>
<p>當婁內克把這粗製的東西，一端按在病人的胸口上，他端把自己的耳朶接着聽診時，旁觀的人都大吃一驚。最後，他的試騐得到了成功。一陣陣心跳聲，越過人體，穿過善本，淸晰地傳入了婁內克的耳鼓。這種聲音，在他聽來，比了世界上最佳妙的音樂，更好聽呢！</p>
<p>不久以後，婁內克製成了小喇叭型的木質聽診器。從此隨着時代的前進，聽診器一步步改良爲今日的形式。</p>
<h3>生活藝術化</h3>
<p>— 石榴</p>
<p>你覺得生活苦悶嗎？無聊嗎？如何除却苦悶與無聊：這個問題你一定很有興趣研究罷？那末，我來吿訴你，惟有生活藝術化，是却除苦悶與無聊的特效藥。</p>
<p>所以，生活要有藝術化，就是使生活永遠不萎靡，特別是勞苦奔波的人，能有一此些時候欣賞音樂，圖畫……的藝術品，更能進一步，運用於你的生活上，你就不感覺到苦悶與無聊了。因此，你對於四周的環境也感到快樂，在工作上的效果也無形提高了。</p>
<p>這裏有一個很好譬喩：我以爲人生不能與道德分離，而道德正是精神的美。道　思想的培養很是需要。而物質環境對於道德思想也有密切的關係。因之生活藝術化，是使人置身其中，思想純潔，身心愉快，對於工作也發生極大的興趣。</p>
<p>我認爲生活與藝術有着密切關係，應該打成一片。</p>
<h3>腳</h3>
<p>— 朱民</p>
<p>造物者公平地給予每個人一雙脚。</p>
<p>可是同樣的脚有不同的使用。</p>
<p>拉着沉重的車輛趕路要用脚，摟着花枝招展的舞女玩通宵也要用脚。</p>
<p>勞働者的脚是性命，有了健步如飛的脚才有飯吃，他們是以最大的熱忱報答了上天好生之德的。</p>
<p>然而，老爺太太們的脚登樓嫌吃力，少爺小姐們的脚上　嫌路遠，他們　脚是多餘的，結果祇是做了皮鞋和絲襪的陪各。</p>
<p>這也許是迭物者之始料所不及的吧！</p>
<h3>一念</h3>
<p>— 良月</p>
<p>聖人，愚夫，雖然是判若雲泥，但他們最初的分野，僅由於「一念」之差。</p>
<p>他們好似最初停留在兩條路的交點上，愚夫毫不思索地走上了歧路，而聖人却深深地考慮後才走上了正路。他們各自進行着，而他們的距離也隨之增加。這就是所謂：「失之毫釐，謬以千里」。這就是所謂：「聖益聖，憑益愚」。</p>
<p>因此可知，由於「一念」就發生了巨大的差別。</p>
<p>所以，我們對於這「一念」，能不當心麼？它寳是我們他日成功與失敗的一個關鍵呢！</p>
<h3>修養語錄</h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>處理困難的事，如同整理一團亂絲，愈急愈找不着頭緒，祗要耐着煩忍住性，必能不被困難所阻礙，而且能戰勝困難。</p>
<p>「希望」是指引黑暗茫茫的人生征途的明燈，正當的希望，能增進人生眞的趣味；不過希望不是平空地，毫無感觸地所能產生的，因之，造成希望的「刺激」，也成爲人生的要索呢。</p>
<p>「文憑」，不過是一張含有魔性的廢物，「實學」是一件具有神力的武器。</p>

<h3>On the New Situation in East Asia</h3>
<p>Among the recent personnel changes in the Japanese cabinet, the most noteworthy is the transfer of Ambassador to China, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to the post of Foreign Minister. This is because the Japanese government is currently the sole center of gravity in promoting the East Asian political situation, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry bears the responsibility for promoting Japan's foreign relations. Therefore, changes in the Foreign Minister position are inherently closely related to the evolution of the East Asian situation.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the position of Foreign Minister was initially concurrently held by Prime Minister Tojo, and later by Shigenori Togo. After Togo resigned, it was succeeded by Kazuo Aoki until this current change. Currently, most of the diplomatic affairs within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are handled by the Greater East Asia Ministry, while the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry is limited to diplomatic affairs centered around Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. However, due to general circumstances, the workload of the Foreign Ministry is actually less burdensome than that of the Greater East Asia Ministry. Therefore, the importance of the Foreign Minister position seems to have diminished somewhat compared to before.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the current change in the Japanese Foreign Minister involves the appointment of Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, who enjoys a reputation as a realistic diplomat, is the point we want to discuss further. At the same time, it is also a key to understanding the new situation in East Asia.</p>
<p>First of all, the question that comes to mind is whether the powers and affairs of the Foreign Minister position will be the same as before after Shigemitsu assumes office. However, observing the various developing situations, it is certain that the powers and affairs will be more extensive than before. Therefore, Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister gives us a very clear indication: that "the position of Japanese Foreign Minister is no longer as simple and light as it has been in recent times."</p>
<p>From Japan's perspective, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, the future of the German-Soviet war, and the various aspects of Japan's foreign relations arising from other world situations, cannot be discussed in great detail here. However, in summary, the Japanese government's diplomacy towards Germany and the Soviet Union will be extremely delicate and important from now on. In particular, diplomacy towards the Soviet Union will naturally involve the United States and Britain, and there will also be close connections with the war on the China and South Pacific fronts, as well as other political matters. Therefore, the Foreign Minister must be familiar with the situation in China, and also understand the political situations in the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United States and Britain. In this complex situation, he must have a calm and accurate judgment of the situations arising from all sides, in order to implement the most realistic diplomatic policies. Under these various requirements, Shigemitsu is undoubtedly the most suitable person. We believe that this is the main reason for the current appointment of Shigemitsu as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Secondly, from our country's perspective, based on the reasons mentioned above, Japan's diplomacy towards China now needs to be considered and coordinated in conjunction with its diplomacy towards Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Therefore, the center of gravity of Japan's diplomacy towards China has shifted from Nanjing to Tokyo, and then from Tokyo to the international arena. This understanding is very important and should not be overlooked. In other words, although it is due to objective circumstances, our government's international standing has been enhanced as a result. This is also worth noting.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the Greater East Asia War has already moved from the stage of military operations to a new stage of comprehensive integration of politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economics. In other words, it is a new stage of comprehensive warfare that is being implemented on the path of past Japanese victories, but in a more complex and sustained manner. And the position of the National Government has further become a more important member of the international community as a result.</p>
<p>We must recognize the new situation in East Asia, actively assist the government, and urge the government to have the ability to shoulder the tasks of this more complex new stage, and assist Japan in completing the victory of the Greater East Asia liberation war.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Ambassador Tani and Farewell to Ambassador Cai</h3>
<p>The unfolding of the new situation in East Asia requires closer cooperation between China and Japan, concentrating all the strength of both countries to prepare for the final victory in the future decisive battle and to welcome the dawn of East Asia. The practice of this new mission of China and Japan naturally depends on the joint efforts of the people of both countries, and how both sides can be of one mind, mutually understanding and mutually assisting, to complete the mission, is first of all expected of the authorities of both countries, especially the efforts of the ambassadors of both countries.</p>
<p>Since our country's participation in the war, the friendly relations between China and Japan have developed more favorably. In particular, the transformation of Japan's policy towards China, taking the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions as an opportunity, has moved towards a path of sincere cooperation, mutual assistance, and joint construction of a new order in East Asia that matches the name and the reality. Here, we express our respect for the wisdom and correctness of the national policy of the authorities of the friendly nation's government, as well as the efforts and struggles of former Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, who recently transferred to Minister of Foreign Affairs. In particular, Shigemitsu's sympathy and care for our nation's liberation movement has left a bright and indelible impression not only in Chinese political circles, but especially among our people. Since Ambassador Shigemitsu's honorable promotion to Foreign Minister, the concern and anticipation of our people for the new ambassador's candidate is no less than that of our government authorities. And today, the good news comes from the east, that the former Foreign Minister, Tani Masayuki, who has long been admired by the government and the public in our country, has been transferred to the Ambassador to China. We truly have a feeling of overwhelming honor.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani has served in the Japanese diplomatic corps for thirty years, and especially towards our country, has understanding and sympathy. We firmly believe that Ambassador Tani will be able to further strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation following former Advisor Aoki and Ambassador Shigemitsu, and complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. He declared that "the Empire, in order to adapt to the new situation, and with the aim of assisting the National Government and strengthening its political power, resolutely implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. China's long-cherished wish for a century of sovereign integrity has been achieved. The coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan has also been on the right track, and there is no need to say more about the thorough implementation of this new policy by our country in the future. This has extremely important significance in building a new order in Greater East Asia. Therefore, the impact of its results on all the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and even the whole world is truly difficult to estimate." Ambassador Tani further pointed out in response to the current overall situation, "I have received the imperial command this time, and I must take the will of the frontline soldiers as my will, deeply understand the government's policy, and step forward to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation." Based on this, it is even more anticipated that Ambassador Tani will strive to promote the overall cooperation between China and Japan in the future, in order to win the final victory of the war. This will definitely have a very significant impact on the future of East Asia.</p>
<p>While welcoming Ambassador Tani's early arrival, our country's new Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, has also completed his mission of inspecting the new situation in various aspects after participating in the war in North China and returned to the capital. He will soon cross the sea to take office. In this new era of rapid progress in Sino-Japanese friendly relations, we have the same warm expectations for Ambassador Cai. Ambassador Cai's understanding of the international situation and the position of Japan does not need us to boast about it. We hereby express our words of farewell in advance to his future efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendly relations. First of all, we hope that Ambassador Cai will reflect more of the actual situation of our people, especially to reflect the emotions and ideals of our people to the Japanese people at any time, so that the combination of the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan is not limited to the war period, but extends to the endless future; not only to the governments or political circles of the two countries, but expands to the people of all levels; not only limited to politics, military affairs, and economy, but permeates culture and society. Because only this kind of practical effort will consolidate the true cooperation between China and Japan, and will take the cooperation between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan as a model, and further establish the unity of the East Asian countries and establish a new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>The importance of the current situation and the arduousness of the responsibilities borne by China and Japan in this situation can never be described in ordinary words. Therefore, the current stage of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is by no means comparable to ordinary international relations. In this new sense of shared hardship between China and Japan, the so-called diplomacy has a deeper meaning. Neither side can play its diplomatic tricks from the starting point of selfishness and self-interest like British and American diplomats. What China and Japan urgently need today is no longer the ordinary so-called "harmony between nations" and "compromising and negotiating," nor is it general diplomatic work; what is actually required of the envoys of both sides must be a comprehensive understanding of the international situation and the mission of the two countries, a deep understanding of the integral relationship between China and Japan, and a practical understanding and sympathy for the other side's national policies and requirements. Japan must fully understand the legitimate demands of the Chinese nation for independence and freedom and provide practical assistance, not only focusing on unilateral and temporary interests. China should also thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and make the greatest efforts to assist Japan. And the envoys of the two countries must make the greatest efforts in this regard, and cooperate closely with the governments of the countries where they are stationed, especially the people of the other side, to overcome all difficulties and pave the way to complete their missions. While sincerely welcoming and sending them off, we hope that the dawn of East Asia will follow the two ambassadors and shine on the entire Pacific region as soon as possible.</p>

Seeing the rapid progress made by Japan's aircraft, tanks, artillery, and all kinds of elite weapons in such a short period of time, they felt sincere admiration.

<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Returns to the Capital; Delivers Thoughts on Visiting Japan Before Returning Home</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Chu Minyi, who represented our country at the Third East Asia Medical Conference in Japan and presented the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Yuan from our country to the Emperor of Japan as a special envoy of the National Government, has completed his mission and flew to Shanghai on the 28th. On the afternoon of the 29th, Minister Chu took the Nanjing-Shanghai express train and returned to Nanjing at 9:20 p.m. that evening.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, Chu Minyi, delivered his impressions of this trip at the request of Japanese reporters before leaving here on the 28th to return home. The following is a transcript of the main points: "This time I have returned to Tokyo again, almost at the same time. Initially, I came here as a physician, leading the Chinese delegation to attend the East Asia Medical Conference, and planned to discuss the issue of communication between Chinese and Japanese culture with various sectors of the Japanese government and the public from the position of a cultural person. Later, I was ordered by my government to be a special envoy for the presentation of the medal, and was able to present the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Kuang, which my country presented to His Majesty the Emperor, before the Emperor. Now that the matter has been completed and I am returning home, I would like to briefly express my feelings: During my tenure as Ambassador to Japan, and last year when I visited Japan as a special envoy, and again last winter when I visited with Chairman Wang, I have repeatedly received the preferential treatment of the Japanese royal family and the welcome of the government and the public, and my sincere gratitude cannot be expressed in words. This time, the National Government, in order to repay the sincere assistance of your government over the past three years, presented the Medal of Grand Cordon of T'ung-Kuang to His Majesty the Emperor, in order to express the gratitude of our government. I have once again received the generous treatment of the royal family, which is an unparalleled honor. I was fortunate to attend the second East Asia Medical Conference and meet with representatives from the medical community in various parts of East Asia to express our views on promoting the development of East Asian medicine. I also elaborated on the issue of Tai Chi exercises and health. Such mutual learning and discussion will surely benefit the development of East Asian medicine. Since the introduction of Western medical theory into Japan, in only a few decades, countless Japanese scholars have studied it intensively, analyzed its essence, and strived to popularize it. It has created its own unique style and is shining brightly. It has perfect facilities and comprehensive systems for the treatment of diseases and the health care of the people, which are worthy of China's emulation. During my tenure as Ambassador to Japan, I visited the Imperial University Hospital. This time I had the opportunity to visit the Keio University Hospital, and I deeply admired the perfection of its equipment. In the future, in order to promote the development of Chinese medicine, we must learn from Japan as a reference. Previously in Nanjing, I announced the case of the relic of the skull of Xuanzang, who was a great contributor to the spread and development of Buddhism in China, and the direct introduction of Buddhism into Japan began in the Tang Dynasty, so Xuanzang also made great contributions to the spread of Buddhism in Japan. This time, I unintentionally discovered his skull relic in Nanjing, and I plan to build a pagoda so that it can be passed down for a long time. Therefore, I held a tea party to invite people from Buddhist and cultural circles to jointly celebrate the event. Fortunately, I received the enthusiastic support of Japanese people, and in the future, when the bone pagoda is completed, it will be admired by Buddhist believers from both China and Japan, and it will also be a symbol of Buddhist exchanges between the two countries. Buddhism was widely spread due to the introduction of Xuanzang, and the scriptures he translated have made great contributions to Chinese Buddhism. Later, Buddhism flowed into Japan, and many more schools of thought were formed, which became even more brilliant and had a great influence on Japanese culture. In the future, in order to further develop Buddhism in China and Japan, it is necessary for Buddhist believers in both countries to cooperate. This time, I also participated in the grand ceremony of worshiping Confucius at the Yushima Seido. Confucianism has been circulating in Japan for a long time, and the systematic introduction and transmission began in the Tang Dynasty, which has had a great influence on Japanese politics, education, culture, and ethics. To this day, Japanese people still respect Confucius. Since the last few decades, China has accepted Western culture in its entirety, without selecting foreign theories, without digesting them, and accepting them unconditionally. It regards Confucianism as rubbish, and even regards Confucianism as a bandit. As a result, Buddhist concepts and social order have been greatly disrupted, and the central ideas of the past have also been fundamentally overthrown, creating today's situation of ideological confusion. In the future, if we want to rebuild the new order in East Asia, we should take Confucianism as the central idea and further promote the spirit of morality. Recently, the National Government has stipulated that Confucianism should be held in the spring and autumn festivals in a grand manner, and this is also the reason. This time I have been in Japan for more than ten days. Initially, I came here as an engineer and had a lot of contact with various parties. What I admire deeply is the tempering of the spirit and the firmness of determination of the Japanese people from top to bottom. They are working hard and tirelessly in their respective positions, which is enough to guarantee victory. Since its participation in the war, the National Government has had a firm determination to defeat the United States and Britain, and is determined to do everything in its power to work hand in hand with Japan to achieve the completion of the war. This time I have witnessed the strength and tenacity of the Japanese national spirit, the intensity of work, and especially the firm confidence in the war, and I am deeply moved. When I return home this time, I will convey the enthusiasm and determination of the Japanese people to my people, so that they can be more vigorous and more diligent in order to achieve the purpose of the war. Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, I have had sincere discussions with various Japanese officials. Japan's new policy towards China has now entered the stage of practice from theory. Recently, the Japanese government resolutely and voluntarily returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, so that China can develop independently, and our country is sincerely grateful from top to bottom. In the future, we must work harder to implement this policy. At the same time, China must also work harder to seek its revival, so that it can have sufficient strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Zhou Discusses Impressions of Visiting Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered to visit Manchukuo. He departed from Nanjing on April 8th, arriving in Manchukuo via Dalian. After inspecting the region for eight consecutive days, he returned to Dalian and Lushun for two days of sightseeing before heading to Beiping on the 19th. After a few days stay, he returned to Nanjing on the 25th. As Special Envoy Zhou has already completed his important task, reporters rushed to interview him to ask about his impressions of the trip. He replied as follows: "During my visit to Manchukuo, I received much assistance from all levels of government and society in Manchukuo, as well as from the Kwantung Army, which allowed me to complete my mission. Upon arriving in Dalian, I was warmly received by the Governor of Kwantung Leased Territory, who showed me around Dalian and the historical sites of Lushun. I will never forget this kindness, and I will convey it to my countrymen, in order to strengthen the East Asian axis. The purpose of my trip was to promote friendship between China and Manchukuo and to observe the construction of Manchukuo. After arriving in Manchukuo, I was able to engage in candid discussions with wise men from all sectors of Manchukuo society and inspect the new [areas missing] of Jilin, Harbin, Fengtian, Fushun, Anshan, etc. I learned deeply of the determination of the Manchukuo authorities to strive for victory in the war and their belief in building East Asia, which is completely in line with our own. The rapid progress in various construction projects was especially beyond my expectations. We deeply admire the authorities' meticulous management on the one hand, and on the other hand, we increasingly recognize the urgent need for our country to develop industry. At a time when Japan and Manchukuo are jointly protecting the northern border, and China and Japan are united in waging war, China shoulders extremely important responsibilities and tasks. I hope that the people of the country will be of one heart and one mind, work hard and forge ahead, and strive for economic construction, so that internal unity and external freedom and equality can be realized at an early date."</p>

<h3>Lin Xuanchang Encourages Youth on the Fifth of May Youth Day</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Secretary-General Lin of the New National Movement Promotion Committee released a statement on the Fifth of May Youth Day. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>At the time of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and the first general review of the China Youth Corps, comrades from various regions suggested designating a Youth Day, which was a very good idea. I reported this to the Leader, who graciously approved it. The Supreme National Defense Council resolved today to designate May 5th of each year as Youth Day. On the occasion of the first Youth Day, I would like to share the following five points with my fellow young comrades:</p>
<p>(1) April 4th is Children's Day, June 6th is Teachers' Day, and May 5th is the anniversary of the Father of the Nation's inauguration as President (National Day of the Republic of China, Double Tenth Day in the 10th year of the Republic of China). The fact that we are now designating May 5th as Youth Day is not a coincidence, and it has a profound meaning. On this day, we should recognize the difficult creation of the Republic of China, and especially deeply recognize the spirit of the Father of the Nation's leadership of the youth over the years, continuing the revolution, advancing wave upon wave, and fighting against reactionary forces. The Double Tenth Day of ten years ago relies on the Double Fifth of ten years later to regain its glory; the Double Fifth of [22] years later should inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Double Fifth of [22] years ago; so that the Double Tenth Day in the future will forever be a glorious and brilliant National Day anniversary of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) Completing the Greater East Asia War is the primary task at hand, and it is also the most important step in revitalizing China and defending East Asia. The rise and fall of a nation depends on the spirit and strength of its youth; the victory or defeat of a war also depends on the strength of its youth. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is unfolding victoriously, the friendly relations between China and Japan are growing day by day, and China, after years of disaster, has finally struggled to break free from the shackles of a century of aggression, we are holding the first Youth Day. All my young comrades must refine themselves, strive forward, and concentrate all their spirit and strength to seek the completion of the war. By cultivating one's own spirit and strength, enriching the spirit and strength of the youth of the whole country, and then uniting the spirit and strength of the youth of East Asia, we can ensure that our spirit and strength are always and everywhere sufficient to overcome the spirit and strength of the enemy, crush the enemy, and strive for victory. The future of China and the future of East Asia depend on this.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of designating Youth Day is to enable the youth of the whole country to raise their vigor of courage and diligence, and endurance once a year. On this day each year, we should review the work of the past, recognize the importance of our responsibilities, and in deep reflection and self-criticism, stimulate our efforts for the year ahead.</p>
<p>(4) The Leader advocates the New National Movement in order to establish oneself, urging the people of the country, and making them certain that everyone can establish themselves, so that they may contribute to the establishment of the nation; and it is certain that China can establish itself, so that it may contribute to the establishment of East Asia. My young comrades follow the Leader's instructions, and should use these four words as the motto of the New National Movement. Every Youth Day, we should use this as a benchmark to review the past and plan for the future, everywhere giving play to the spirit of establishing oneself, and constantly enriching this spirit.</p>
<p>(5) China's youth movement has had a vigorous development, but it has been either empty and scattered, starting with frivolity and then declining, or divided into factions, [attacking each other], as a result, the knowledge and abilities of individuals have not been enriched, the strength of the collective has not been given play, and the nation and even the overall situation in East Asia has suffered. In the future, we should use Youth Day as a symbol of the youth of the whole country's unified belief and unified action, consolidate its unity and increase its strength, in order to save China and protect East Asia.</p>

<h3>Close Liaison Between London and Washington Attempts to Reconcile Soviet-Polish Relations; British Policy Shows a Tendency to Accommodate Moscow; Sikorski Government May Undergo Reorganization</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – The diplomatic correspondent for the London Daily Mail reported this morning that British Prime Minister Churchill discussed the severance of relations between the Soviet and Polish governments with President Roosevelt by telephone, which shows the concerns caused by the note sent by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Sikorski. Washington has adopted an extremely reserved attitude towards this crisis. However, the US Minister to Poland, Biddle, has recently held several talks with the Polish Prime Minister. Political observers in Washington believe that this indicates that the United States is engaging in active diplomacy regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: News received from London clearly shows that British policy tends to completely abandon the Polish government-in-exile in London in order to accommodate Moscow. Since British newspapers suggested on Tuesday that the Polish government be reorganized to restore Soviet-Polish relations, sympathy for the current Polish government in London has clearly reached zero this morning. Political circles believe that the reason for this development is that Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky has assured Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden that the Soviet government will never abandon its current position, no matter what. Those who still hope to obtain some kind of agreement are anticipating that the Polish government will resign and be replaced by a government organized by non-anti-Soviet elements. Therefore, in the past 24 hours, the British opposition to the Sikorski government has become increasingly important. The London Times yesterday symbolized the main principles of British policy towards the Soviet-Polish conflict, saying that Churchill and Eden fully understand that the closest trust is needed between Britain and the Soviet Union, which is truly commendable. Political circles inferred from this sentence that the British government will notify the Polish government that, in order to achieve close understanding between London and Moscow, the British government will no longer be able to assist the Polish government. Reuters also commented on this issue, using all the arguments of the Soviet government, even saying that the Red Army has made great contributions to the liberation of Poland, without taking into account the Soviet Union's claims to all of Poland's land. Reuters also criticized the Polish government for allowing its newspapers to constantly irritate the Soviet Union regarding future border issues, and said that the authors of these articles were irresponsible and that the Polish government did not prevent the publication of these articles.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the Soviet Union had long established a Polish Communist Committee, originally hoping to use it to oppose the Polish government-in-exile in London. The time for this has now clearly arrived, and this is the main method used by the Soviet government to exert pressure on Britain after severing relations with the Polish government. Washington's hope that Soviet-Polish relations are only suspended rather than severed is wishful thinking. This can be confirmed by the wording of the English note sent by Moscow to the Polish leaders. London is trying to require Poland to reorganize its government in the hope of finding a solution. But in this case, Poland may have three governments, one in Moscow, one in London, and Sikorski's government will establish its headquarters elsewhere. But in any case, Britain will never allow its European policy to continue to be incomplete, nor will it allow its ties with Moscow to be threatened.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to reliable sources, the Soviet government has repeatedly planned to gather the Committee of Polish Communist Immigrants residing in the Soviet Union in order to overthrow the Polish government led by Sikorski. Taking advantage of the worsening Soviet-Polish relations, it immediately established the committee. It is also learned that the committee has decided to send Commissioner Vasilyev, a female writer, to London to carry out activities.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Fascist newspaper stated yesterday that General Sikorski has decided to move the Polish government-in-exile to Washington. It is understood that this move will only be realized when Britain recognizes the new pro-Soviet Polish government that is rumored to be in the process of being organized.</p>
<h3>Proclamation Issued by Polish Government: Refutes Accusations by Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): According to sources in London, the Polish government-in-exile in London issued a proclamation last night refuting Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's claims that Sikorski was cooperating with Germany and hinting that the Polish government was willing to resume normal relations with the Soviet Union under certain conditions. According to diplomatic correspondents of Reuters, if the Soviet government begins to address the issue of repatriating Polish women, children, and former soldiers still in the Soviet Union, the Polish government is prepared to no longer treat the matter of missing Polish officers as a political issue. The proclamation's content was unanimously approved at a special meeting of the Polish government last night. Its wording was carefully considered as an indirect response to the Soviet Union's declaration of severance of relations. It is nominally announced to the world through newspapers and will be delivered to the Soviet government through newspapers, just as the Soviet declaration was delivered to the Polish government through newspapers.  The Soviet declaration to the Polish ambassador in the Soviet Union accused the Polish government of colluding with Germany and refusing to accept it. According to the Polish side, the content of the declaration was an active proposal for reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Poland. The proclamation deliberately avoided mentioning the Polish government's request for the International Red Cross to investigate Germany's accusation that the Soviet Union massacred 12,000 Polish officers near Smolensk in 1940. Reuters correspondents believe that this matter is now completely dead. The Polish proclamation also did not mention the Soviet Union's severance of relations, implying that if the Soviet government responds to Poland's demands regarding Poles remaining in the Soviet Union, the severance of relations will be considered a thing of the past. The Polish declaration, as previously expected, refuted the Soviet Union's accusations that the Polish government was cooperating with Germany and denied any territorial claims against the Soviet Union. A Reuters reporter stated, "This proclamation will clearly disappoint those who expected the Polish government to suddenly change its stance." It is not yet known how the Soviet government will react, but the British and American governments will continue their joint efforts in London, Washington, and Moscow to reconcile the two countries. The original text of the Polish government's proclamation has been telegraphed to its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Romer.</p>
<h3>British Government Exerts Pressure on Poland: Easing the Crisis of Division Among Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency): The British government convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 27th of this month to discuss countermeasures against the deteriorating Soviet-Polish relations. The following day, Churchill and Eden met with Polish government-in-exile Prime Minister Sikorski and Foreign Minister Raczynski to negotiate. The British government has consistently advocated contacting the US government to restrain the Polish government-in-exile in order to ease the crisis among the anti-Axis nations. According to well-informed sources, the British government seems to be attempting to (1) reorganize the Polish government-in-exile and further urge Sikorski to step down; (2) have the Polish government-in-exile withdraw its application to the Geneva International Red Cross to investigate the truth about the massacre of soldiers; and (3) have Poland abandon its claims to recover lost territories, etc., in order to suppress the Polish government-in-exile. Furthermore, all British newspapers on the 27th unanimously reported, pointing out that the Polish government-in-exile had been deceived by German propaganda. In order to prevent the Soviet government from being incited by various countries' remarks, the British government instructed its newspapers to exercise self-restraint and carefully review the news from foreign correspondents in Britain. The Polish government-in-exile originally intended to issue a strong resolution after the cabinet meeting on the 27th, but it was not issued that day. Only a spokesperson stated that a new situation had arisen. A statement was not issued until the night of the 28th, but the statement was extremely weak, completely different from the previous attitude of the Polish government-in-exile. The main points of the statement were: (1) to request the Soviet government to grant freedom to Polish nationals residing in Soviet territory, especially the young men of conscription age, as they are absolutely necessary to strengthen the Polish military's combat power; (2) the Polish government has always been committed to protecting the integrity of the Polish Republic, but has not made any territorial claims against the Soviet Union; (3) the Polish government earnestly hopes to have friendly understanding with the Soviet Union. Regarding the Katyn Forest incident, a note has been submitted to the Soviet ambassador, but no response has been received.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fighting Continues in Tunisia: Axis Positions Largely Unchanged</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency): A military correspondent of the Havas News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces in Tunisia have not yet completed their large-scale movements since they began on Monday. The main force of the British Eighth Army, defending its positions, appears to be gradually moving to the left flank. The enemy encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces when advancing towards Pont du Fahs from the Djebel Garci area. Furthermore, the British First Army's large concentration point in the Djebel Ang and Djebel Mansour areas has also received substantial reinforcements from the British Eighth Army, and still appears to be planning to break through the Axis positions. At the same time, General Anderson is currently conducting local attacks to improve his positions before launching his offensive, his main objective seeming to be to capture Pont du Fahs. French rebel forces gradually advanced to the northeastern border of Djebel Mansour over the weekend and launched a fierce attack on the city on Tuesday, but this offensive was blocked to the southwest of the city. Although the French rebel forces suffered considerable losses, they resumed their efforts yesterday morning. After gaining a foothold north of the Kourzia Lake, British tank units are clearly attempting to support the infantry's advance. The pressure from the anti-Axis forces here remains quite strong, with fierce offensives following one after another. North of Medjez el Bab, British forces have captured the small village of Sidi Nsir after fierce fighting, but Djebel Ahmera is still in Axis hands. US forces operating in the north made only insignificant gains yesterday. In the coastal area east of Cape Serrat, Axis forces are still engaged in fierce fighting with French rebel forces.</p>
<h3>Italian King Inspects Bombing Zone</h3>
<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency): Stefani Agency reports, according to official honesty, the recent air raid on Grottaglie resulted in a total of 145 deaths and 268 injuries, of which 100 were slightly injured and did not require treatment. The majority of the dead and injured were women and children, who were injured and killed by British and American pilots firing machine guns from low altitude. The Italian Emperor arrived in the city yesterday accompanied by his adjutant to inspect the disaster area and personally comforted the injured, then visited the families of the victims to express his condolences.</p>
<h3>Current Affairs Selection and Translation: The Aftermath of the Soviet-Polish Incident</h3>
<p>This article describes the discord within the anti-Axis group caused by the Soviet-Polish incident. The Soviet government has already, on April 26, through Foreign Minister Molotov's note to Polish Ambassador Romer, announced the Soviet government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government. This action further exposes the deepening rifts between the anti-Axis nations and puts Britain and the United States in a difficult position.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in the forests near Smolensk on the German-Soviet front, German forces discovered the corpses of over 10,000 Polish officers. After the German authorities announced that they were murdered by the Soviet GPU, they appealed to the International Red Cross to investigate, so that an international investigation could clarify the truth to the world. The nature of this case is a tragic event unprecedented in human history. At the same time, with this case as the center, it has exposed new flaws in the disrupted anti-Axis camp, which cannot but attract attention.</p>
<p>What sufficiently proves the German side's announcement is the statement on this case presented by the Polish government-in-exile, one wing of the anti-Axis camp. However, on the Soviet side, they have also come out to deny the German side's announcement, and at the same time accused Poland of being a traitor supporting Germany, vehemently criticizing the Polish government-in-exile.</p>
<p>The truth of this strange incident, rare in international law and in the history of human civilization, should naturally await the fair investigation results of neutral country experts dispatched by the International Red Cross. However, in the currently complex international environment, the International Red Cross, which has always adopted an extremely cautious attitude, finally accepted this issue. Just looking at this fact, one can see the profound and subtle nature of this case.</p>
<p>In short, the fallout from this case has not only brought Soviet-Polish relations to the brink of danger, but also created new rifts in the relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, who have placed the Polish government-in-exile and a series of other governments-in-exile in London and assumed the role of protector. This cannot be easily overlooked.</p>
<p>In 1941, when the German-Soviet war broke out, the Soviet Union changed its previously hostile attitude towards Poland and embraced and supported the Polish nation, which is also a Slavic nation, in accordance with the new policy of uniting all Slavic nations to form a war of nationalities against the German nation. The Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Sikorski, visited the Soviet Union two or three times in succession, and even concluded a Soviet-Polish alliance. Who knew that this time, due to the Polish government-in-exile's demand for the recovery of lost territories and the Soviet Union's insistence on maintaining the pre-German-Soviet war borders, the disparity in their views was exposed, and Soviet-Polish relations fell into opposition. This has caused cracks in the Soviet Union's declared great solidarity of the Slavic nations, and its impact on other Slavic nations is naturally significant. However, what is particularly significant is that this Soviet-Polish dispute has directly developed into a dispute between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, who are backing the Polish government-in-exile, realistically exposing the inconsistency in the anti-Axis camp. Just as this dispute was about to end inconclusively due to the meddling of Britain and the United States, unexpectedly the tragic case of the massacre of over 10,000 Polish officers has now been newly discovered. This issue has not only brought Soviet-Polish relations to the brink of danger, but has also cast a shadow on the relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Although the unclear attitude of Britain and the United States towards this strange case cannot be known, it is feared that due to this case, what will be presented is either a more chaotic pace between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, or that Britain and the United States, who are peddling "humanitarianism," will remove their masks as a result.

<h3>After Defeats in India and Burma, the Enemy Voices Blame and Justification</h3>
<p>In the great annihilation battle unfolding in the Arakan foothills of western Burma, the Japanese army, with its ingenious tactics and strategies, arranged encircling iron rings, creating a great victory that annihilated three brigades of the enemy British-Indian army. According to reports, the Times, the Chronicle, and other newspapers in London, the enemy capital, are all shouting "planned retreat" and describing the causes of the defeat and future operational trends in a rather interesting way. On the other hand, India's "Statesman" published an editorial entitled "Please Publicize the Truth of This Defeat," attacking the authorities and exposing all sorts of chaotic and contradictory ugly situations.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Defeat</p>
<p>(1) Difficult Supply: The Arakan area has many jungles, swamps, riverbanks, etc., crisscrossing each other, and the roads and bridges are incomplete, resulting in difficult supply and extreme shortages of food and ammunition. Conversely, the Japanese army controls the mouth of the Ma Yu River, and can transport supplies leisurely from Akyab to Taung Bazaar, Rathedaung.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Naval Control in the Bay of Bengal and Lack of Ships: Seizing Akyab should have been carried out in coordination with the attack on Rangoon, because seizing Rangoon is the most convenient path to seizing Burma. However, the recapture of the Andaman Islands and the securing of naval control in the Bay of Bengal could not be realized due to the lack of ships caused by the North African operations.</p>
<p>(3) Excellent Japanese Military Technology: The Japanese army builds fortifications on high ground, digs many solid trenches, does not accept the British army's counterattacks, and its ability to camouflage and conceal is truly ingenious, causing the British army to miscalculate the Japanese army's strength time and time again. Especially frightening is the Japanese army's flanking maneuver, which often appears unexpectedly, beyond the British army's expectations: to avoid the threat of the flank, the British army makes successive retreats.</p>
<p>(4) Inability to Use Mechanized Weapons: The terrain there is not suitable for the use of the mechanized weapons that the British army is good at, especially the use of tanks, which is completely impossible.</p>
<p>(1) It has explored the Japanese army's defenses in Burma.</p>
<p>(2) It has been able to neutralize the value of the attack base Akyab.</p>
<p>(3) In this operation, the British army has gained valuable practical experience in jungle warfare.</p>
<p>(4) It has attracted the main force of the Japanese army in Burma and the Japanese air force in the southwestern Pacific to Arakan, and has reduced the Japanese pressure on Chongqing and Australia.</p>
<p>Future British Military Operations</p>
<p>This operation is very similar to the Burmese War of 1824. After the British army crossed the Naf River and occupied Maungdaw, it divided its forces into two teams, one south and one from Buthidaung towards Rathedaung, in coordination with the southern army, so as to seize Akyab from both sides. However, due to the Japanese army's meticulous defense, it was cleverly encircled by infiltration tactics. However, this retreat is actually a "planned retreat" before the monsoon is about to arrive. A large-scale attack will be launched again at the beginning of next year, but now it is in a state of inability to carry it out.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent defeat and the issue of India, the Indian English newspaper "Statesman" specifically published an editorial urging the authorities to publicize the truth. This provides a good opportunity for members of the National Congress, who oppose using India as a base of operations and oppose making India bear the war expenses for the Burmese operations, to attack the government. On the one hand, the British army's defeat this time has also caused Chongqing, which is dreaming of opening the Burma Road and sending troops to India from afar, to lose all its energy to arrange a common front in frustration.

<h3>A Link in the Tokyo-Syonan Railway: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Reopens After Seven Years</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou, April 25th, Correspondent Iwabata) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, linking Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, and the key point of Jinhua, has reopened after seven years since the China Incident, and has returned to its original state. The 176-kilometer railway between Jinhua and the Jingjiang River bank was celebrated with a grand opening ceremony in Jinhua on April 25th. From that day on, general business will be opened. The construction of the line, from the start, only took six months to complete, creating a new record in the history of world railway construction. Under wartime conditions, its speed is comparable to that of Japanese railways.</p>
<p>This railway was originally built in September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) by Zhang Jingjiang, the then chairman of Zhejiang Province. It started from Xixing in Xiaoshan County on the opposite bank of Hangzhou, passed through Jinhua, Yushan, and then to Nanchang and Pingxiang, forming a winding 600-kilometer railway. Later, due to the outbreak of the China Incident, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks and fled, they blew up the Qiantang River iron bridge and thoroughly destroyed the railway. In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), due to the Zhejiang East and Zhejiang-Jiangxi operations, after the Japanese army secured the area, considering the importance of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, they decided to repair it immediately. Therefore, on May 28th, during the operation, the Huazhong Railway Company was ordered to organize a survey team and began the first step of "building while fighting." At that time, there was heavy rain in the area for days, and the survey team was engaged in turbid currents up to their chests every day. Then, the work team began to swing their sharp hoes on the completely flood-destroyed roadbed and lay the rails abandoned by the enemy.</p>
<p>The operation started in October. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the work team, the 134-kilometer section from Jinhua to Meichi was first repaired on December 13th, and a light train was opened. From April 1st of this year, general business has already begun. The remaining 42-kilometer section from Meichi to the Jingjiang River bank was completed on April 24th, even in the daily rain. On that day, a heavy train was tested on the 176-kilometer railway linking Jinhua to the Jingjiang River bank on the opposite bank of Hangzhou. The cost of the construction, the first and second phases totaling 〇〇〇 million yen, used workers and coolies, up to 14,000 people on the busiest days, averaging 6,000 people per day.</p>
<p>The restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line has significant political and economic significance. Although they belong to Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou and Ningbo, and the inland areas of southern Zhejiang, differ greatly in population and cultural level. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line will be a pioneer in developing the culture of the area. Also, in today's wartime, the strategic significance of this railway is naturally great, but even more important is its mission to develop the resource-rich Zhejiang-Jiangxi region. The area is rich in wartime-essential mineral resources such as fluorite and tungsten, and agricultural and forestry products are also abundant.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is the artery for developing these resources, and also the trunk connecting Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places with the exchange of goods in the interior. After the first phase of the railway was completed in Jinhua and Lanxi, quite a few residents have returned, and the outflow of goods has gradually increased. The railway runs parallel to the Qiantang River, which can promote the exchange of local materials with Shanghai and Hangzhou. Also, the construction of the Qiantang River iron bridge is scheduled to be completed in the near future, and on the other hand, the engineering in Jinhua and Koukoukai is also being accelerated. Once these projects are completed, the resource-rich Zhejiang-Jiangxi region will assume a major role in the construction of the new China, which is particularly noteworthy. At the same time, the line will become a link to quickly complete the Tokyo-Syonan Greater East Asia Railway, and its glorious development day is also highly anticipated.

<h3>General Registration of Major Items: Extension Granted for Ten Days, from May 1st to 10th</h3>
<p>In order to implement the regulations regarding the production, preservation, movement, and distribution of materials, and to carry out the tasks of implementing wartime economic policies and material control guidance and supervision, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has organized the General Registration of Major Items in Shanghai Special City. The registration period was originally from April 5th to April 30th. Now, according to the submissions from various trade associations, members have not been able to complete the registration procedures on schedule, and have requested an extension of the deadline. It is known that the bureau, after learning of the submissions, has granted an extension of ten days out of consideration, from May 1st to 10th. After the deadline, there will be no further extensions. It is hoped that those who store important items will follow the instructions before May 10th and not make mistakes again.</p>
<h3>Per Capita Oil Distribution Period: Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>It is heard that the edible oil wholesalers have been allocated a large amount of soybean oil, which will be sold on the basis of housing tax tickets, but the price will be handled according to the newly revised regulations. Although the oil purchase certificates have been issued by the authorities for the per capita oil distribution issue, the actual implementation period has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Police Station Temporarily Does Not Accept Applications for Citizenship from International Residents: Applications Submitted Before February 18th May Be Forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for Approval</h3>
<p>Regarding international residents, regardless of whether they are male or female, who naturalize as Chinese, they must first go to the local police station to apply for citizenship, and then forward their application to the Ministry of Interior for review. Only after passing the approval can a nationality certificate be issued. It is now known that the Shanghai Police Station has been ordered to open the procedures for foreign residents and stateless residents who applied to the bureau for naturalization as Chinese before February 18th of this year, and their applications may be forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for approval. Other applications will not be accepted for the time being, but special circumstances are not subject to this rule.</p>
<h3>Permits Required for Moving Nitre and Sulfur in the City</h3>
<p>Nitre and sulfur are dangerous goods. A little carelessness can easily cause explosions and great harm. In order to prevent smuggling, the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau specially sent a letter to the Police Headquarters yesterday, asking them to instruct their branches that the movement of nitre and sulfur in the future must have a permit to be transported. Otherwise, it is requested that the police at each post assist in cracking down at any time in order to prevent abuses and avoid danger.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Epidemic Prevention Campaign: One Million People Inoculated, Second Phase to Begin Soon: Check Inoculation Certificates First</h3>
<p>The first phase of the city-wide epidemic prevention campaign began on April 16th, and 930,000 people have been inoculated. It is estimated that 600,000 people in the two concessions and 330,000 people in the city. The second phase of inoculation is about to begin. However, before the second phase is launched, people who should have been inoculated in the first phase but have not yet been inoculated must go to the nearest health center or inoculation center for inoculation as soon as possible. Otherwise, the health and baojia authorities will check inoculation certificates within a few days, and those who deliberately evade inoculation will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Inoculation in Each Lianbao District</p>
<p>Within the first week of the first phase of the inoculation campaign, the Public Concession Health Department inoculated 73,706 people. During the same period, the number of inoculations by the baojia health teams in each lianbao district was even higher, with the Xinza and Chengdu districts alone reaching a scale of 56,000 people. The epidemic prevention campaign in the French Concession began on April 12th, and more than 153,000 people have been inoculated to date. And the number of inoculation teams will soon increase from 15 to 21 teams, because at least 10,000 people apply for inoculation every day.</p>
<p>Forced Inoculation in Northern Zhabei Starting Today</p>
<p>The first phase of inoculation in the area north of the Suzhou Creek has not yet reached the level of universal coverage. Therefore, the health authorities have decided to start forced inoculation from today for a period of one week. During this period, baojia personnel will go door-to-door to investigate, and if they find anyone who has not been inoculated, they will enforce inoculation. It is found that 465,000 people have been inoculated in the area north of the Suzhou Creek from April 16th to 26th, but there are still 200,000 people who have not been inoculated. Therefore, the baojia authorities decided in advance to implement forced inoculation for one week starting today.</p>
<p>United Baojia Inoculation in Western Shanghai</p>

<h3>Starting Tomorrow, Street Cleaning; Neighborhood Chiefs Have Ordered All Households to Prepare</h3>
<p>The Public Concession has decided to launch a large-scale street cleaning campaign starting tomorrow (the 1st). The neighborhood self-governance organizations in each district were notified yesterday to prepare for cooperation. Neighborhood chiefs have already informed all households and requested them to prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Three Purposes of Street Cleaning</p>
<p>The main purposes of the Public Works Department's initiative to launch the street cleaning campaign are three: (1) To promote street cleanliness, in order to fulfill the long-held aspiration of tidying up the city's appearance. (2) To maintain public health, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of epidemic prevention campaigns. (3) To ensure public safety, in order to prevent dangerous incidents (such as the collapse of buildings, and the blowing down of advertising signs by the wind, causing injury to pedestrians, etc.) from occurring.</p>
<p>Commonly Uphold Public Morality and Abandon Bad Habits</p>
<p>From tomorrow until the 7th (Saturday), within this week, the sidewalks of all roads and alleys will be the responsibility of the households facing them to keep clean. As for the pillars, poles, trees, and street lights, water faucets, etc., planted on the roads, they must also be scrubbed clean. Advertising postings along the roads that are detrimental to the appearance of the city will be ordered by the authorities to be cleaned up by laborers. At the same time, the authorities also hope that the public will henceforth commonly uphold public morality, and automatically abandon bad habits such as spitting or urinating indiscriminately, as well as arbitrarily discarding waste paper and fruit peels, and indiscriminate posting of advertisements or propaganda papers, etc.</p>
<h3>Increased Postage for Parcels</h3>

Also, He Kelang, a third-grade student at Xia Guang Elementary School, found a gold ring on the playground and immediately handed it over to the school's training office to be claimed. Subsequently, the owner, classmate Jiang, rewarded him with 50 yuan. He Kelang believed it was something he should do, so he transferred the money to student aid. Both students care about impoverished students. Their aspirations are commendable and they are role models for students. The student aid received yesterday totaled: Qian Hailong (Calligraphy Competition Award) 100 yuan, Wu Jian'an 100 yuan, Zhu Rongbo 100 yuan, Fu Hong 80 yuan, He Kelang, third-grade student at Xia Guang Middle School and Elementary School (Playground Find Reward transferred to aid) 50 yuan, Pu Ji'ting (In memory of his mother keeping her chastity for 40 years) 40 yuan, Hengjiu Silk Shop 35.2 yuan, Chen Peiting 30 yuan, totaling 535.2 yuan in stored value coupons, with a balance of 320,068.99 yuan.</p>
<h3>Collection of the Superstition Business Tax to Begin in Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>The preparatory office for the elimination of the superstition business tax under the Municipal Finance Bureau has been actively carrying out various investigation tasks since its establishment. As of now, the categories of superstitious business items in various districts of the city, as well as the total consumption, have all been completed. Application forms have now been successively distributed, so the number of people going to register in the two concessions and other districts these days is very enthusiastic. It is also scheduled to officially establish the levy collection office for superstitious business item donations on the first day of next month, and the collection work will begin in mid-next month.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Adopt Effective Measures to Sanction Illegal Cigarette Merchants; Sheng Taihe and Other Tobacco Shops Ordered to Suspend Business; Tobacco Allocation Group Also Sends Personnel to Supervise</h3>
<p>After the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association unified cigarette allocation, the third phase of allocation has been fully completed, and the preparation for the fourth phase of allocation has also begun. In order to effectively implement price limits and eliminate hoarding for profit, in addition to the Association specially assigning supervisors to supervise wholesalers and retailers at any time, it is also discussing high and appropriate sanction measures with the authorities of the two concessions. At the same time, purchasers are allowed to report to file charges, to serve as a basis for investigation and handling. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Board of Directors of the French Concession, in view of the rampant cigarette black market, have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate various cigarette sales companies. It is reported that eighteen tobacco companies, including Shenghetai, were sealed up by the French authorities and ordered to suspend business temporarily, awaiting investigation by the authorities for price increases and refusal to sell cigarettes, as well as failure to issue invoices in violation of orders. It is also learned that in addition to Suzhou and Wuxi, which have been organized and established, the tobacco allocation sub-associations in other areas are being actively organized.</p>
<h3>Security Organs in This Port to Bid Farewell to Preparations Beginning Today, to be Lifted by June 1st</h3>
<p>The security authorities of the two concessions, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the Huxi Police Bureau have decided to implement special security measures from today until June 1st, for the sake of maintaining law and order, given the many commemorative days in May, in order to prevent and guard against incidents and ensure safety. It is reported that during this special security period, in addition to all detectives and investigators being dispatched to investigate and arrest thieves and other criminals in their jurisdictions, they are not allowed to request leave under any pretext.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association Raises Impoverished Education Fund</h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of middle and elementary school students who have dropped out of school has been increasing daily, which has a major impact on the future of the country. Zhou Huaru of the Municipal Education Association, in view of this, has specifically raised one million yuan for the impoverished education fund to provide relief. He is currently actively preparing. After the association's Chairman Chen Jian has decided on the candidates for the fundraising committee, fundraising will begin immediately. This is truly good news for impoverished students in the city.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Urban Tax Revenue; Strengthening Revenue Collection Work</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the prosperity of tax revenue in its subordinate districts is of great importance to the city's treasury revenue, and that it is imperative to effectively rectify and intensify revenue collection work. It has recently held meetings in the bureau's conference room with revenue collection personnel from the revenue collection offices in its subordinate districts. The meeting was chaired by the bureau's director, Yuan Houzhi. In addition to listening to the monthly collection situation of each district, the strengthening of future revenue collection work was also discussed in detail. Director Yuan also instructed on revenue collection matters, to enrich the treasury revenue.</p>
<h3>Tram Stop on Jing'an Temple Road at Chengdu Road - Effective Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple Road in the Public Concession runs east-west and is a main artery for tram transportation. However, the distance between Mohawk Road and Carter Road is quite far, and there has never been a stop, which has caused inconvenience to passengers. Although eastbound vehicles stop at the west end of the Jockey Club, it is very close to the Carter Road stop, which seems superfluous. The Shanghai Tram Company, in view of this, has decided to set up a stop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road starting tomorrow, so that passengers on Route 1, Route 2, and Route 12 vehicles can board and alight there. The stop at the west end of the Jockey Club has been announced for cancellation.</p>
<h3>The Urban Fresh Meat Industry Should Still Pay Business Tax</h3>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the urban fresh meat industry should continue to pay business tax, the Municipal Finance Bureau has reviewed and approved the matter. Although the urban fresh meat industry has already paid slaughter tax, it should still be subject to business tax at a rate of 5/10, according to the regulations of the first category of goods for sales revenue, in order to enrich the city's treasury revenue. Orders have been issued to the revenue collection offices in each district under the bureau to comply and implement accordingly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qing Propaganda Team Adjusted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qing Branch Political Work Corps, in order to enhance the effectiveness of on-site propaganda work in the Qingxiang area, has specifically mobilized the special district public offices to adjust or organize district propaganda teams to cooperate in promoting work. It is learned that the public offices in Nanhui and Beiqiao districts in the first phase of the Qingxiang area have fully adjusted and strengthened the district propaganda teams. The Fengxian District Public Office is also actively carrying out this work. In the second phase of the Qingxiang area, the public offices in Jiading and Baoshan districts will also organize and establish district propaganda teams separately, while the Chongming District Public Office is also starting to work and will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Parcel Notice: (1) The Jiangsue district of Linze and Huangqiao post offices have resumed accepting parcels and large and small package mail. (2) The "List of Post Offices in the Beiping Postal District that Have Stopped Accepting Parcel or Small Package Mail" has recently been revised.</p>

<h3>Sports: Chinese Mixed Team Draws with St. Friend; Each Scores One Goal, Sharing the Glory; Mixed Team to Go North on May 4th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Mixed Team, in order to go on an expedition to North China, met the St. Friend team at the Xuhui Middle School field at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience flocked to the field. The referee was He Chunhui, the linesmen were Zhang Le and Chen Jixiang. The Chinese Mixed Team's goalkeeper was Liu Xianhan, the defenders were Li Tiansheng and Li Ning, the center-backs were Song Lingsheng, Qu Yongfu, and Zheng Yingquan, and the forwards were Dai Guayin in the center, with Li Yichen and Han Longhai on the left and right, and Jia Youliang on the right wing and Wu Qixiang on the left wing. The lineup was exceptionally neat. The St. Friend team, due to the absence of Greenberg, Cairo, Ivanov, and others, replaced them with new players Legrin, Huntsson, and Strongson. Everyone expected the Chinese Mixed Team to easily defeat them. However, after the match began, the Chinese Mixed Team felt out of place due to the small field and slippery ground. The match remained a stalemate until the 13th minute when St. Friend scored the first goal in the restricted area, leading 1-0. The Chinese Mixed Team launched a counterattack, with many good shooting opportunities, but due to bad luck with the ball, Wu Qixiang launched an attack from the side in the 25th minute and passed the ball to the center. Unfortunately, Li Yichen held the incoming ball, seized a moment to exploit the gap, and kicked low, shooting into the center of the goal, tying the score at 1-1. The first half ended 1-1, with the outcome undecided. After changing sides, Zhang Lin, Geng Youren replaced Li Tiansheng, Li Ning, the rest remained unchanged. The Chinese Mixed Team's attack was greatly intensified. Li Yichen and Dai had several shooting opportunities, but all were unsuccessful. In the 11th minute, Wu Qixiang got the ball and slammed it fiercely, but it went out by a foot. Although the attack was very fierce, it pressed until the end of the match. In conclusion, the score was 1-1. The Chinese Mixed Team will leave Shanghai for the north on the 4th of next month.</p>

<h3>Business World: Commentary: Loan Syndicates for Supporting Production</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that our country's production is lagging behind. The main tool for promoting local products everywhere is the production loan syndicate in the financial world. Therefore, this column argued on April 26 in "The Exchange of Funds Between Cities and Rural Areas" for the active handling of agricultural finance in order to increase food production. It is very gratifying that the Ministry of Finance authorities decided yesterday to organize a rural revitalization lending syndicate to concentrate large sums of money for low-interest lending in rural areas. Undoubtedly, this is a powerful step in supporting agricultural production.</p>
<p>However, the word "supporting production" is of course not limited to agriculture. Industrial and agricultural loan syndicates are both prerequisites for intensifying production. Due to the establishment of agricultural loan syndicates, we hope that the important industrial sectors in the country understand the importance of loan syndicates, have open and honest consultations with the financial world at any time, and promote this organization, either with goods as the main body or with enterprises as the goal. Therefore, we wrote an article on April 13 called "Banking and Industrial Lending."</p>
<p>As for the method of organization, it is better to keep it simple. For example, in the case of industry, when a certain company in a certain industry launches a certain product, it can contact the financial world about the amount of funds needed, and can at any time pledge the collected products as collateral. Within a certain limit, it is shared by the participating banks; within this limit, a certain industry and a certain company can issue acceptance drafts to the syndicate. After the acceptance by the syndicate, the certain industry and a certain company can either sell it themselves or hold it to the participating banks for discounting; the participating banks can decide on their own how to allocate the amount of the above-mentioned discounting based on the situation at any time, and can introduce it to financial colleagues outside the syndicate for discounting; the discount rate should not be too high, in order to comply with the purpose of supporting production; at the same time, it is hoped that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks will allow the drafts held to be used as collateral, and give them the convenience of borrowing and splitting at a discount of the face value, and it is even hoped that the Central Reserve Bank will allow rediscounting at any time, in order to complete the efforts of the banking industry to help production in the promotion of production enterprises.</p>
<h3>With the Assistance of the Authorities, Various Factories Resume Production; The Supply of Spot Goods is About to Increase; Trade in Various Parts of Southeast Asia Needs to be Restored Urgently</h3>
<p>The various factories in this city once showed a sluggish phenomenon, so that both production and sales plummeted. By the previous year, they were actively assisted and adjusted by the authorities. Regarding the problems of raw material distribution, fuel supply, production volume, and promotion, comprehensive solutions were discussed and implemented in order. To date, large and small factories in various industries have gradually shown active and quasi-active states, work has resumed, production has increased, and export improvements are making great progress.</p>
<p>Returning Factories to Start Production</p>
<p>According to the news yesterday, the authorities in the Japanese army are returning the various factories in stages. In addition to a small number that have resumed production earlier, the majority are also being actively planned by the factory owners, and are currently resuming production. They will soon return to a normal state, processing and delivering goods. At that time, the supply of various spot goods will inevitably increase greatly. However, the scarce raw materials needed by the factories to manufacture goods still need to be supplied or distributed in large quantities by the authorities, otherwise, it will inevitably feel slightly difficult.</p>
<p>Southeast Asian Trade Needs to Be Restored Urgently</p>
<p>It is found that the items manufactured by various large and small factories in this city, in addition to supplying to the various companies, business firms, and stores in this city for retail sales, and being transported to various parts of the country, are mostly transported and sold to various parts of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the recovery and prosperity of trade in various parts of Southeast Asia is related to the development of industry and commerce in this city. People in the industrial and commercial sectors are eager to find ways to restore the old situation for Southeast Asian trade, which can not only obtain a large amount of raw materials, but also transport a large number of manufactured products to be sold, it is learned that leaders in the industrial sector have repeatedly suggested to the authorities, and have negotiated good strategies in turn.</p>
<h3>Recall of Loans; Tightening of Bank Funds; Sluggish Business for Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>In the financial industry of this city, after the authorities issued an order prohibiting speculation, the small banks and small money shops practiced self-discipline, resulting in their business being very sluggish. Furthermore, as a result of the major banks recalling loans, several small banks and money shops felt the tightening of bank funds.</p>
<p>Hoarding and Selling; Prices Falling</p>
<p>Under the circumstances of tight bank funds, general hoarders with scarce funds had to slightly sell off their hoarded goods. Therefore, the black market prices of various goods such as soap have fallen by more than 10% in recent days. However, the general retailers have not yet lowered the prices of their retail goods.</p>
<p>Sluggish Business; Mergers and Change of Business</p>
<p>Due to the sluggish business of the various small banks in this city, in order to adapt to the environment, there is talk of mergers, resulting in the more sluggish business for the general smaller-scale money shops after the military notes stopped being issued. Several small money shops in Hongkou have already changed to other businesses.</p>
<h3>National Sugar Industry Federation to Hold Founding Conference on May 2nd; Circular Sent to Trade Associations in Various Districts to Participate and Deliberate</h3>
<p>The National Sugar Industry Trade Association Federation, since the Ministry of Food designated Huang Jiangquan as the preparatory director, and Shi Yuchun and Zhu Chunbo as the preparatory deputy directors, the preparatory director Huang Jiangquan and others immediately set up a preparatory office at No. 23 Tongyun Street, Yihang Street, French Concession, and actively prepared. It is scheduled to convene the founding conference on May 2nd. A special circular has been sent to the sugar industry trade associations in various districts to send representatives to participate in the conference to discuss the progress together. At the same time, the counties within each district should also be urged to quickly organize in accordance with the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations and the General Rules for the Organization of Trade Associations, and to participate in the local trade associations as members, in order to complete the organization.

<h3>Noteworthy: Newly Established Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Thoroughly investigating hoarding and severely punishing speculators are the unified hopes of the people at present. However, at this time when everyone is eagerly anticipating rectification, the new establishment of banks, money shops, enterprises, and companies is still like bamboo shoots after a rain, which is something worthy of special attention.</p>
<p>Previously, the National Government issued an order prohibiting financial institutions from engaging in commerce, followed by an order prohibiting the establishment of new financial institutions. However, after the promulgation of the order, there were still banks and companies established. Were these newly established banks permitted by the Ministry of Industry before the government issued the order? Or are they relying on some special reason? Disregarding the law is baffling.</p>
<p>Most of the enterprises established since September of last year have a speculative purpose. They maintain a special relationship with specific banks and act as mobile units for the banks. Seeing their behavior of buying Baohua stocks, one can imagine that various enterprises have the risk of hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>Although there are no clear statistics on the number of enterprises, according to estimates by a certain agency in the concession, there are no less than a thousand large and small. Even with the lowest estimate, there are more than five hundred. During the period of promoting the new economic policy, financial, commercial, and industrial institutions that can promote the revival of industrial production should have been encouraged. However, commercial institutions that have no connection with industrial production, or even those that only have a superficial relationship, and even companies with no reserve funds and ordinary unimportant factories are all established for speculative profit. Regardless of whether they are hoarding, such indiscriminate establishment is a problem worthy of attention. (From the Continental News on April 29th)</p>
<h3>Preparatory Personnel for Various Industry Associations in Jiangsu Province Determined</h3>
<p>The General Rules for the Organization of Grain Industry Associations have been promulgated by the Ministry of Food. It is understood that among the organizational methods for these industry associations, except for the flour industry, which has already organized an industry association in this province, the remaining industry associations will divide the counties of this province into several districts, with each district forming an association for management purposes. After receiving the order, the Provincial Grain Bureau instructed the county governments to instruct the relevant grain industries to separately select representatives to come to the bureau for discussions. The representatives from each county have reported to the bureau in recent days and held a symposium at the bureau. It is understood that as a result of yesterday's meeting, the preparatory personnel for the preparatory offices of the three major industry associations of grain, flour, and animal products in various districts of this province have been determined. In addition, it is reported that since receiving the order from the Ministry of Food to reorganize, the Wuxian Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative has been actively preparing and recently convened a general meeting of directors and supervisors, which was officially established on May 1st.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Municipal Animal Industry Association, with Xie Meisheng and others actively preparing as designated by the Ministry of Food, held its inaugural meeting yesterday (29th) afternoon at 2 pm in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Ji Hua, Director of the Ministry of Food's Shanghai Office, and more than 200 members of the association were present. Xie Meisheng and others were elected as directors, and Zhang Jitang and others were elected as supervisors. The meeting adjourned at around 5 pm.</p>
<p>The city's fresh meat retailers (i.e., meat shops) originally had an organization called the Fresh Meat Industry Association. This time, the Ministry of Food stipulated that the industry should also be included in the Animal Industry Association.

<h3>Strengthening the National Government and the Hoarding Problem (I)</h3>
<p>The political importance of the hoarding problem has been repeatedly discussed. The reason why we repeatedly raise this issue in detail is that the hoarding problem is the biggest obstacle to the development of the National Government's politics, economy, and ideology. This problem cannot be simply discussed and resolved as an economic problem or a technical problem. It is a comprehensive issue of establishing China's participation in the war system, and it must be properly resolved along the lines of strengthening the National Government and promoting the established national policies of the new economic policies of China and Japan, in order to be pertinent. The key to the solution is very complicated, and there are inseparable connections between them. Several points of view are listed below:</p>
<p>First: How should the National Government solve the hoarding problem this time to strengthen the credibility of the National Government?</p>
<p>Second: With what kind of vision should we observe the relationship between China's state capital and the hoarding problem?</p>
<p>Third: How should pure Sanmin Zhuyi be developed as the basis for solving this problem?</p>
<p>Fourth: What is the relationship between the price problem and the production problem, and how should this relationship be resolved?</p>
<p>Fifth: What is the significance of solving the hoarding problem in the economic war against the Chongqing regime?</p>
<p>Sixth: What is the relationship between solving the Shanghai national capital and the hoarding problem? What is the relationship between China's financial capital, industrial capital, commercial capital, and the hoarding problem?</p>
<p>Seventh: How should the National Commercial Association be strengthened to solve the hoarding problem?</p>
<p>Eighth: Should the Japanese people promote the solution of the hoarding problem in an objective sense?</p>
<p>Ninth: What is the significance of the remarks on the hoarding problem in the current stage of ideological warfare in China?</p>
<p>Tenth: How should the gap between the Chinese reality after participating in the war caused by the hoarding problem be overcome, and what methods can be used to further realize the ideal?</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there are many more issues that should be raised. In short, the various problems caused by hoarding are the problems of the National Government itself. The above-mentioned points of view, such as how to solve the hoarding problem, how to strengthen the National Government under the war, and how to implement the new policy, can be summarized into one problem. The interrelationships described above are extremely important. The highest authorities of China and Japan should express effective and appropriate theoretical and practical determination, and it is hoped that the general public will have absolute trust in this in order to promote the feelings of the people of China and Japan and smoothly solve this problem. All empty talk is of no benefit and must be avoided. (Translated by Yunpeng from the Continental News on April 29)</p>

<h3>Study Shops · Students</h3>
<p>— Ye Renhu</p>
<p>"Complete departments," "flexible time," "limited enrollment," "apply quickly," "low fees," "express completion in × months," the study shop owner uses all his skills to attract customers. Time, economy, and effectiveness, everything is carefully considered for future customers. It is truly cheap and good, with excellent "color," "fragrance," and "taste."</p>
<p>School has started, and the enrollment results are indeed not bad. The classroom is full of men, women, fat, thin, tall and short, and hundreds of different students. There are vocational youths, day school students, hard-working students, those who steal the name but have no substance, ... and even those who regard the school as a place to pursue the opposite sex.</p>
<p>However, "studying together" is ultimately different from commodities. After paying the price, if you don't study hard, even if it's "express," you still won't get anything in the end.</p>
<p>Gradually, the number of people in the classroom decreases day by day, finally showing a terribly sparse scene, although the teachers are still barking and jumping around.</p>
<p>The semester is almost halfway through, but the enrollment advertisements are still hanging, but the "school start date" and "limited enrollment" have been changed to "classes have already started" and "limited remaining places."</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the advertisement has not been completely lost after all. Sometimes, two or three new customers are recruited, regardless of whether the courses are continuous or cannot be inserted in the middle. In short, as long as there is actual payment, you can "join the class at any time." Fortunately, there are "complete departments," so if this department doesn't work, you can change to another department. If it's not "returning the goods," you always have to "accommodate"!</p>
<p>The study shop owner seems to understand the psychology of the customers quite well, and then changes into a set of "spring new class" and "express special class" outfits, so the classroom is crowded again!</p>
<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— Wei Huan</p>
<p>A "hesitant" young man, although possessing perfect ideals and a spirit of moving forward, often encounters small setbacks and recalls the "malicious criticism" and social contempt of others who are "prisoners of the old society." This makes him hesitant and allows "hesitation" to linger in his heart. From then on, he wanders in the middle, failing to "persevere" and accomplish anything. A great career is thus "smothered and disappears," only to be ridiculed by others. How regrettable!</p>
<p>On the contrary, a "strong-willed" young man, although encountering failures, tasting the world's "sarcasm and ridicule," and suffering the attacks of "malicious criticism," does not despair or "hesitate." Still based on the "indomitable" spirit, he is not afraid of difficulties and moves forward. He harbors the ambition to "relieve the frustration" and "die with hatred." Finally, he invents "things," discovers "truth," and steps into the ranks of "success." This kind of person is what we "sing praises to day and night."</p>
<p>Therefore, "hesitation" is the destroyer of "career" and the thorns on the road to "life" success. "It" must be destroyed, and "life" will be bright and glorious.</p>
<p>"Malicious criticism," social "sarcasm and ridicule"... these are all part of the "bad environment," which is the driving force behind "hesitation." But we cannot "refuse to eat because of choking," blaming the "bad environment" and abandoning the responsibilities we should bear, without working hard. You must know that the modern world needs more "truth" and more "things" to make it brilliant and civilized.</p>
<p>In short, what the modern world needs are people who are "strong-willed" and "dare to act," not people who are "hesitant" and "irresolute." Therefore, those who are "hesitating" and "wandering on the way" should hurry up and "work hard"! Invent one more "thing" for the world, discover one more "truth," and make the world more brilliant and civilized.</p>
<h3>Harmony and Simplicity</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Artists demand harmony in color coordination; musicians demand harmony in the rhythm of tones; our lives even more demand harmony in the progress of life.</p>
<p>Disharmony in life - anger, worry, according to actual tests, is extremely harmful to the cells of life. In other words, disharmony in life is self-harm, shortening the course of one's life!</p>
<p>The first condition for seeking harmony is simplicity. The color coordination of pattern paintings often uses similar colors and opposite colors for harmony. The rhythm of musical instruments' tones is harmonious with regular sound waves. Why can't we explore the harmony of our lives in the realm of simplicity?</p>
<p>Modern life is naturally complex. However, complexity is not opposed to simplicity. Mess is the enemy of simplicity. Complexity with order, with arrangement, united, is also simplicity, and the simplicity unified from complexity is also the most complete simplicity, the most beautiful simplicity.</p>
<p>People's irritability and restlessness in life are often treasures bestowed by confusion. Lack of order in clothing and food often leads to melancholy thoughts, hesitation and indecision in thinking often lead to painful feelings, and aimless walking often leads to boredom. If you drive away the mess and dispel the confusion, irritability and uneasiness will also run away.</p>
<p>"Simplifying life" is indeed a famous saying containing great truth. The simpler life is, the more harmonious the mood of life is. You must find clues from the complexity of life, draw out the logic, and give it a simple arrangement and treatment: give a regular fusion to the fixed life of clothing, food, and housing, and there will be a single law for time and place. The thoughts in the mind must also be simplified, the ambition is one, the hopes are connected before and after, combined on one road, the will is firm, and any obstacles cannot shake it in the slightest. Then completeness is waving in the future, success is welcoming in the future, where will you be attacked by anger, hatred, resentment, and grief!</p>
<h3>Purpose and Method</h3>
<p>— Ji Wei Yi</p>
<p>People are born with a "purpose." Having a "purpose" is also because of a "purpose" that a person will go to work, eat, ... and do the daily things that must be performed. Society will only be able to transform from the primitive era of eating raw meat and drinking blood to the enlightened culture of today. The world will only be described as: turning like a huge wheel. Perhaps some people think that "purpose" is an obstacle to freedom, because of "purpose," we cannot move freely and act recklessly. Yes, noble "purposes" do not allow these things to happen. But, bad "purposes" are fundamentally seeking these things, then I can't say with certainty: "purpose" is absolutely an obstacle to freedom.</p>
<p>Once a "purpose" is set, it must be carried out and methods must be found to achieve success. Therefore, the same "purpose" can produce many dissimilar "methods" to carry it out due to the different wisdom and character of each person.</p>
<p>The achievement of a great cause is certainly worthy of our great celebration, but the value of its "method" of success must also be considered to determine its value. If the "method" of achieving it is dirty and despicable, then no matter how difficult this work is, it will always be despised. Conversely, if its success does not harm others and is achieved step by step with the greatest effort, then it can have its true value.</p>
<p>The success that the ancients called "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones wither" is not desirable. We must not build the bronze statues of one or two people on the foundation built by the livers and brains of thousands of compatriots. We should recognize that this success belongs to the public.</p>
<p>Often some people think that as long as success is achieved, regardless of whether it is obtained by dirty means, this concept is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>If we want to achieve true success, first we must have a superb "purpose" that does not deviate from the real environment, and then we must use the most effective "method" that does not hinder others to carry it out.</p>
<h3>Stand Firm</h3>
<p>— Yu Huai Rui</p>
<p>Xiao Qing remembered seeing such a couplet there: "Eat your fill, stand firm." In today's expensive world, the first line is no longer appropriate, but the four words "stand firm" are a timeless truth for being a person.</p>
<p>In the long run, many scientists, revolutionaries, explorers, ... in ancient and modern times, when their careers were just starting, were often scorned, ridiculed, and even scolded by ordinary people around them who were short-sighted and confined to prejudices, but they were not afraid at all, they identified their goals, stood firm, and worked hard with perseverance and unwavering confidence. In the end, they achieved their immortal great cause. Their names occupy a very important place in the history of mankind, shining brightly for thousands of years!</p>
<p>In the present day, there are some people in society who, although their income is very meager, can be thrifty everywhere, willing to live in simplicity, walk slowly, and eat thin porridge. If they don't have money to add new clothes, they will just make do with mending. Although the ordinary people around them laugh at them and despise them, they are not confused by the eyes of the efforts, but just stand firm and continue to do so with peace of mind. So although rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cassia, and everything is soaring, they can barely get by. On the other hand, another group of people with higher incomes, because they cater to the social worship of prosperity, pay attention to face and ostentation everywhere. They must wear gorgeous clothes, eat fine food, travel by car when going out, and be served by servants at home, all to show their wealth. As a result, they cannot make ends meet, their debts pile up, the timid ones sit in a city of sorrow all day long, anxious, and the treacherous ones embezzle public funds, defraud people of money, and as a result, they are discredited and increase the number of crimes in society.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether for career, learning, or life, we should always remember these four words: "stand firm."</p>
<h3>The Invention of the Stethoscope</h3>
<p>— Gao Dao</p>
<p>Everyone has seen doctors often put a pair of stethoscopes on the patient's chest and back to listen to the sounds from the heart and lungs to determine the disease. This pair of small trumpet-shaped things, although very simple, its invention also hides a very interesting story!</p>
<p>The sounds from the heart and lungs, due to the obstruction of the trachea and bronchi and the disturbance of internal organ noises, often make it difficult to hear clearly from the outside. Laennee had already seen the importance of auscultation for eliminating diseases in 1819. However, when experimenting, he encountered the above-mentioned difficulties. Especially for obese people, the mechanical sounds from his chest, once transmitted to the outside, would even disappear. Laennee had also encountered such patients. His ideal, before it was realized, was therefore even more shadowed. But behind the shadows, the seeds of the invention of the stethoscope were buried.</p>
<p>One day, Laennee saw a group of children playing on a pile of wood, one of whom put his ear to one end of the wood, and the other stood at the other end, knocking on the wood. Their signals were transmitted from the wood. Seeing this, Laennee's mind was suddenly touched. He hurried back to the hospital and rolled a paper book into a round shape. This is the first stethoscope in history.</p>
<p>When Laennee put one end of this roughly made thing on the patient's chest and the other end connected his ear to listen, the onlookers were shocked. Finally, his experiment was successful. Bursts of heartbeats crossed the human body, passed through the good book, and clearly entered Laennee's eardrum. This sound, to his ears, was better than the most wonderful music in the world!</p>
<p>Soon after, Laennee made a small trumpet-shaped wooden stethoscope. From then on, with the progress of the times, the stethoscope was gradually improved to today's form.</p>
<h3>Life Artization</h3>
<p>— Pomegranate</p>
<p>Do you feel bored with life? Bored? How to eliminate boredom and boredom: you must be very interested in studying this question, right? Then, let me tell you that only the artization of life is an effective medicine to eliminate boredom and boredom.</p>
<p>Therefore, life must be artistic, that is, to make life never wither, especially those who work hard, can have some time to appreciate the works of art such as music and paintings, and can further apply them to your life, you will not feel bored and bored. Therefore, you feel happy about the surrounding environment, and the effect of work is also improved invisibly.</p>
<p>Here is a very good metaphor: I think that life cannot be separated from morality, and morality is the beauty of the spirit. The cultivation of moral thought is very necessary. And the material environment also has a close relationship with moral thought. Therefore, the artization of life is to make people placed in it, their thoughts are pure, their body and mind are happy, and they have a great interest in work.</p>
<p>I think that life and art have a close relationship and should be integrated.</p>
<h3>Feet</h3>
<p>— Zhu Min</p>
<p>The Creator fairly gives everyone a pair of feet.</p>
<p>But the same feet have different uses.</p>
<p>Pulling heavy vehicles on the road requires feet, and playing all night with a dazzling dancing girl also requires feet.</p>
<p>The feet of laborers are their lives. Having nimble feet means having food to eat. They repay the Creator's virtue of cherishing life with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
<p>However, the feet of old masters and mistresses find it difficult to climb stairs, and the feet of young masters and young ladies find it too far to go to work. Their feet are superfluous, and in the end, they only serve as companions for leather shoes and silk stockings.</p>
<p>This may be something that the Creator did not expect!</p>
<h3>A Thought</h3>
<p>— Liang Yue</p>
<p>Sages and fools, although they are as different as clouds and mud, their initial distinction is only due to the difference in "one thought."</p>
<p>They seem to initially stay at the intersection of two roads. The fool walks down the wrong path without thinking, while the sage walks down the right path after deep consideration. They proceed separately, and the distance between them increases accordingly. This is what is called: "A small error in the beginning leads to a great deviation in the end." This is what is called: "The sage becomes more sage, and the fool becomes more foolish."</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be seen that a huge difference occurs due to "one thought."</p>
<p>So, how can we not be careful about this "one thought"? It is a key to our future success or failure!</p>
<h3>Maxims for Self-Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Dealing with difficult things is like sorting out a tangled thread. The more anxious you are, the less you can find the clue. You just need to be patient and restrain your temper, and you will definitely not be hindered by difficulties, and you will be able to overcome them.</p>
<p>"Hope" is a bright lamp that guides the dark and vast journey of life. A proper hope can enhance the true interest of life; however, hope is not something that can be produced out of thin air or without feeling. Therefore, the "stimulus" that creates hope also becomes an essential element of life.</p>
<p>"Diploma" is just a piece of magical waste, and "real learning" is a weapon with divine power.</p>

<h3>Exhibition of Art Treasures from Famous Collectors to Donate Proceeds to Scholarship Funds</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Ha Shaofu, the master of Baotie Yanzhai, also known as Old Man Guanjin, has a family collection of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties, the result of more than fifty years of effort. He has a vast number of fine pieces. The iron inkstone in the old man's collection is especially a rare treasure. The inkstone has been appraised by famous figures both domestically and abroad, such as Cang Shuo, Qiu Nong, and foreign dignitaries such as Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, who personally inscribed words on the scrolls, confirming that it is a relic of the Song Dynasty, making it an even more priceless piece. The Ha family is known for their charitable tradition. Now, feeling that cultivating outstanding students from poor backgrounds is the duty of all Chinese people, his descendants have decided to publicly exhibit the precious inkstones, paintings, and other items collected over the years. This will not only allow people from all walks of life to appreciate them, but also use the proceeds, after deducting expenses, entirely as scholarship funds. This is a beautiful undertaking that achieves two goals at once. The exhibition period is from May 1st to 5th, at the Ningbo Fellow Association hall.</p>
<p>(2) Ms. Shen, intelligent and talented, is well-versed in Western painting. Her landscapes and still lifes are elegant in color and unique in style. Recently, she will exhibit her fine works at the Daxin Art Gallery, and will offer two masterpieces for charity sale from all her works. One is priced at four thousand yuan, titled "Qingchuan Hanzao Jing," and after it is sold, she plans to donate two thousand yuan each to the Shenxin and Liang Zhes Scholarship Funds. The other is priced at three thousand yuan, titled "Jiaqi Sheng Zhaoxi," and after it is sold, she will donate it to the Orphanage for Refugee Children.</p>
<p>(3) Dahua Animal and Plant Company, along with Mr. Zhou Shidong from Zhongyuan and others, in addition to engaging in agriculture, have raised 200,000 yuan to establish the Daguan Bonsai Company (abbreviated as Daguan Art Garden) at the intersection of Haig Road and Shanzhong Road, covering an area of more than five acres. It is managed by the famous painters Jiang Hanting and Tao Hanying. The garden is planted with famous varieties of peonies, azaleas, roses, and other seasonal flowers in abundance. Mr. Shen Yibai has designed and created hundreds of bonsai, all full of poetic and artistic charm. The Art Garden has scheduled a public exhibition of all seasonal flowers and bonsai from the 30th of this month to the 10th of May, and will allocate 20% of the income as scholarship funds. Lovers of beauty are welcome to visit and purchase.</p>
<p>Foolish People Help Henan Disaster: Having read your esteemed newspaper, I learned of the extraordinarily tragic disaster situation in Henan Province.

<p>Distributing Free Measles Coupons: (Letter from Mr. Wang Xiazhang) All symptoms of measles, eczema, impetigo, trachoma, malaria, etc. can be cured radically in a short period of time, thereby relieving the suffering of patients. A kind of sterilizing needle medicine and skin stain removal powder are applied externally. Even the most severe cases can be completely cured in no more than three weeks. Now, to reduce the burden on patients, special discount coupons are prepared and distributed to all sectors of society. The time is limited to 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. I am enclosing fifty free coupons, which patients can request from your office for popularization.</p>
