<p>社評</p>
<h3>歡迎鮑斯主席</h3>
<p>印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯氏，於列席大東亞會議之後；轉道訪問我國，蒞臨首都，我們對此為四億印度人民的自由解放而奮　的民族志士，無任欽仰。</p>
<p>印度為東方文化很古的國家，土地之廣裹，人口之衆多，資源之豐富，在亞洲居第二位，地位相當重要。然而不幸的遭受英帝國主義的侵略，統治了二百多年，印度人民處於淫威的壓榨下，二百餘年的歷史，誠是血漬斑斑，直到今天，大部份印人還被奴役壓迫。這種現象，不但是印度人民的恥　，也是全亞州人民的恥辱。</p>
<p>英國對於印度的資源，　量　取，供其本國人民享用，同時，作為便略別國的本錢，所以，英國之視印度，無異生命綫，過去印度志士也曾不斷發動革命的反抗運動，可是於被施用殘酷的高壓手段而摧殘　即如去春，當時的印度民族領袖甘地等　英國使　克里浦斯談判決裂，即遭逮捕拘禁，以迄於今，其他被殘害的印人，族向上自由解放之要求，巳經普遍深入廣大羣衆，脫出英國之桎梏，僅為時間問題。這是從印度民心內在的因素而言，巳至非解放自助不可的境地了。</p>
<p>其次，從外來環境以觀，則盟邦日本自從發動大東亞戰爭，以各民族各國家各然也以同樣的熱忱，協助獨立。鮑斯氏原為印度自由而頻年奮鬥之志士，至此，遂毅然奮起，飛往日本，與日本當局開誠商討，在鮑斯氏為祖國自由而奮鬥，勇往直前，義無返顧，自為必然之事；主日本為實踐大東亞主義，援助各民族獨立的一買方針，本於熱忱而作最六之協力，亦為意想中事。於是鮑斯氏遂遄赴昭南，組織印度舊時政府，被舉為主席，並編組印度國民軍，以為對英作戰之先驅。</p>
<p>本月上旬，大東亞會議，在日本舉行，各獨立國家行政首腦均有代表赴會，印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏亦應邀列席，這巳說明印度臨時政府在亞洲地位之重視。日本代表東條首相演說，更强調日本對於印度之支援，略謂：「今日英國之壓迫印度，巳逐日益烈，印度四數人民所受之痛苦，實非言語所可形容。……凡我大東亞人民，對於印度慘狀，無不義憤塡膺。同時吾人對此，實難放置。印度志土鮑斯氏毅然崛起，印度國內外人士亦起響應，於茲益見印度政府之樹立，印度獨立之基礎亦吿奠定，帝國曾向中外聲明決對印度之爭取獨立，予以一切之協力與支援。」其後，緬甸代表巴莫氏並說明印度獨立與大東亞建設之有密切關係，印度如無自由，亞洲即無自由，籲請大東亞各國各民族對於印度獨立予以全面支援。</p>
<p>我們在中印兩國之歷史關係，在反英的共同任務，在完遂大東亞戰爭的共同目標之下，對於印度之爭取獨立，自必以最衷心之熱忱，作最大之協力，這是全中國人民的共同意思，願此次獻給鮑斯氏，並表示歡迎之忱。</p>
<h3>印臨時政府主席鮑斯由日飛抵京　汪主席等親蒞機塲歡迎</h3>

<p>南京十七日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯氏，以此次在日出席大東亞，議任務己畢，特行訪問我團。鮑斯主席於十七日率同隨員印度國民軍參謀長，兼無在所閣員彭斯利，印度國民軍總司令部附（中佐）拿周，秘書哈桑，曁日方同行者千田司政長官，山本大佐，太田書記官等一行九人。由日本福岡乘機起飛，於常日下午五時半抵達首都明故當機塲。汪主席親蒞機塲歡迎，國府高級官員到有褚外交部長，梅內政部長，鮑總參謀長，葉陸軍部長。任海軍部長。陳建設部長，周行政院秘書長，林宣傳部長，顧糧金部長。李警備司令，陳軍委會委員，吳外次，　　次·日方到有各大使，松井總參謀長，前田海軍武官·外國種節到有德國章爾曼大使，吉　總領事，滿洲國呂榮　大使等數十人·機塲四週及沿途，均由　警戒備。　斯主席專機於五時二十分在細雨霏霏中降落機場。同府樂隊旋　樂數迎，議式異常隆重。鮑斯主席御深紅色西服，神采奕奕，在眾樂　　聲中下機後，褚部長遂赴前迎　。鮑斯氏首與主席攜手寒喧，繼興各歡迎人員一一握手。主席先離機塲　返官　，鮑斯氏及隨員等一行，則由褚部吳等各歡迎人員陪至貴　室，略事休息，並款以香橫。嗣由褚部長陪同鮑斯主席、乘國府專備之禮東赴迎賓館。</p>
<h3>全國衛生會議　昨圓滿閉幕　議長陸潤之致閉會詞</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　昨（十七日）日為第一次全國衛生行政會議第三日，上午九時，全體會員及各地醫學專家，仍在大會議長　之，秘書長林　霄主持下，在中日文化協會南京廳舉行第二次全體大會·至十二時討論完畢，旋即舉行大，　幕典禮如儀後，由議長陸　之致閉幕調。詞畢，全體會員代表推天津巿代表侯扶桑致答詞，詞極一切。至一時許，此統一全國衛生行政，確保國民健度之第一次全國衛生行政會議，始吿圖滿閉幕。</p>
<p>議長陸潤之閉會詞</p>
<p>略謂：第一次金國衛生行政會議　　開會，到今日巳吿圓滿結束。此次提案共計一百廿五件，巳通過者一百廿三件，保留者兩件。所表決各案，除健全衛生行政機構，與確定衛生行政經費兩部。屬於衛生行政，自當促其正當發展外，其他各案，如培育衛生專門人才，　廣衛生工作，，加强防疫、調整醫一等類，皆與社會福利健康，有密切關係。但衛生行政範團內所推行之事，　於消費方面者為多，而注重於生產方面者，察之無幾。是此次　決案，關於衛生經　一部份，還須仗中央曁地方財政當局，予以同情之援助，並期待各省巿　生行政負實者之努力，使此次會議，不致成為形式之集會，而成為實踐之過程，為新國民運動基礎上劃一新紀元，朋本會無上之光榮，即自今始。</p>
<p>汪言席訓話</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　首次全衛會議主席訓話原文：（續昨）以上所說，關於醫學設備，醫　材料，即使有　也無從　買，况且錢也不是容易得到的。聽說這一次會議的提案，有許多是關於經費的，這自然都是急要，但是還都以來，三年有餘，財政方面雖然比較以前開展，然而用途隨以增加，財政依然十分因　。有人說到為甚麼不多印　紙帶，不錯，戰時各國都採用紙幣政策，不過紙幣賣出大多，定然影響到通貨膨　，於人民痛苦，不但不能减輕，反致加重。舉個例來說，一個公務員月薪一百元，物價高漲時是不能維持生活的，政府要加又高漲到二百五十元，那夠實行增加紙幣政策，是全賴民余肯熱心　買公債，因為租稅收入是有限的，全賴人民肯膳買公債，政府一面因有緊急用途，將紙幣增加發行，一面又從公價中把紙幣收回來。這樣一面發行，一面收回，貨幣循環，自然不致這貨膨脹了。巾國呢，例如上海方面，盡有數十萬萬的財力，但是他們却用以不放，那麽公債便不能發行了，紙幣也就不能增加發行了。</p>
<p>說來說去，物質的缺乏，還是由於精神的缺乏，如果精神方面有愛國心，有根據愛國心的組織，各事還是能辦的。即以醫學人才而論，中國醫學人才固然缺乏。而且在這少數的醫學人才中，大部份是集中在都市。因為都市富裕者較多，請得起高價的醫生，買得起高價的葉物，這樣一來，鄕村多動人民，就無從沾有近代醫學之賜予。即以都市而論，在南京請醫生就不如學只是都巿富裕者之專享品，輪不到鄉村大多數人民的，省疾病有痛苦無從解不，這不是很痛心的事　？</p>
<p>我也知道，一個高材的醫生，從事營衆得利多，而且容易。從事衛生行政得利少，而且　得為愛國心所驅使，為大多數人民的疾病痛苦而動心，才捨却營業觀念，來從事衛生行政。像現在中央醫院黎醫生等，及衛生署陸書生等。便是如此。我想全國以內醫學人材具有同　的愛國心，具有解救大多數人民疾病痛苦的慈悲心，必也大不乏人。這一次衛生行政會議，便是集會這些醫學人材，拿出愛會心，以及解欽大多數人民痛苦的工悲心腹，聚在一起，共同謀衛生行政組織的改善。使之地理化，使之逐漸普及。把衛生的効能，由都市漸漸的推及鄉村，使全國人民即使窮苦的，也能漸漸的受到近代警學之賜，這是衛生行政會議，最大之目的，也就是要生行政在議最高尙之精神。兄弟工以此意祝出席各位先生健康，祝衛生行政事業的進步。</p>

<p>東京十七日中央社電　日靑木大東亞想，於大東亞新聞大會席上，祝辭要旨如次：大亞東新聞大會，本人得略述所懷，表示祝意，實不勝欣快之至。日本忠勇之陸海軍，僅於半年內，即將仇敵英美在東亞之侵略據點覆滅，於戰爭中，已確立有利態勢，近更逐次擊潰敵軍執拗之反攻，愈益擴大戰果，並着着展開建設大東亞共榮圈之巨步，洵堪同慶。因大東亞戰爭之勃發，大東亞情勢之一變，日本欲藉此機會與鄰邦各國提携，使大東亞恢復其本來面目，乃實施各種施策。最近我國與大東亞各國間締結之同盟條約，亦以相互尊重獨立自主與緊密協力提携爲其基本精神，前於東京舉行之大東亞會議即實現此大　想過程中之一大進展。余認大東亞會議所以能僅於二日間收獲如此成果者，乃由於亞洲人反抗數百年來之英美壓迫，已自覺其共同使命，今日實爲全亞洲興廢之分歧點，不再化爲英美之殖民地。因此，大東亞各國家，各民族須一致團結，完成此次戰爭邁進於新秩序之建設，大會通過之共同宣言中所閘明之原則，有共存共榮，獨立親和，闡揚文化，繁榮經濟及貢獻世界進展，此即建設大東亞之憲章。大東亞會議之赫赫成果與五原則表現之道義精神，應速使大東亞各民族澈底認識大東亞地域更應結成一團，依據此大憲章邁進於建設大東亞，此實爲當前急務。此種道義精神，不僅爲各國政治外交之指標，且包含各民族之接觸，而須使之充分表現於公私生活之間，諸君擔任指導與論，自應負此重任，在些重大時期，大東亞各地報界代表聚集一堂，舉行如此之大會議，實有重大意義，相信本大會必將收穫莫大成果，本人於茲，　祈大會之成功。</p>
<h3>林宣部長</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　宣傳部首席參事許錫慶·於大會席上代表林部長誦讀祝詞，其要旨如次：此次大東亞新聞大會在盟邦首都舉行，正當大東亞戰爭進入決戰階段之際，又值中日盟約大東亞共同宣言先後簽訂之時，其使命之要且大，其意義至深且遠，今當大東亞各國精誠團結總力決戰之期，當如何動員第四戰綫之總力，在思想上一方面掃蕩英美侵略主義之毒素思想，及東亞叛逆依存英美之奴隸觀念，以配合大東亞戰爭戰略上之開展，一方普及大東亞各國同生共死·共攻共守·相倚相扶·共存共榮之根本理念，以協助大東亞建設攻略上之推進，實爲當務之急。欲達到此目的，則大東亞新聞界之結果，不僅在感情上之聯絡，與事業上之觀摩已也。國際機構之籌　，技術合作之商討所關甚大。本屆大會信必能於茲二者加以重視，從而獲致具體之方　，此所望於大會諸公者一也。敝同新聞事業，於離亂之餘，從事復興，　當根據自國國情，依於本然物質遂共發展，尤須配合大東亞全體之需要，順應時代動向，共同策進。凡此種種，所賴於盟邦同　先進相倚相扶者甚多，尙祈不　　手予以協助，此所望於大會諸公者又一也。</p>
<h3>宣揚大東亞建設　啓發各地域人心　天羽總裁闡述記者使命</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日天羽情報局總裁，十七日於大東亞新聞大會席上，發表演說，要旨如次：此次大東亞各地新聞界代表各位會聚一堂，於此舉行大東亞新聞大會，洵堪慶賀。東亞之新聞大會，過去曾舉行三次，第一次大會適值皇紀二千六百年，係在東京舉行，第二次於前年在廣州舉行，第三次爲滿洲建國十週年，在新京舉行，每次大會僅有中日滿三國代表參加，未能網羅全東亞代表，故本人常引爲遺憾，然此次大會中日滿三國以外，更有泰國，菲律賓，緬甸及昭南，爪哇，蘇門答臘等地多數代表參加，今此舉行</p>
<p>空前未有</p>
<p>之大會，此與本月初舉行之大東亞大會，同爲大東亞興隆之象徵，洵堪同慶。同時，藉此機會本人得對諸位略述所懷，更爲欣佒，今日吾人爲抵禦英美之侵略，確保大東亞之和平，共謀復興大東亞起見，正與敵人戰鬥，諸君亦爲完成大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞乃不分晝夜以報紙言論繼續努力奮鬥，吾等於茲謹對諸君衷心表示敬意。觀過去數百年間，英美侵略東亞最有力之武器，厥爲謀略宣傳，於表面上用盡巧言令色欺騙東亞人，於背後則大施種種謀略與欺騙，以武力略取印度，錫蘭，馬來，緬甸，印度納西亞，菲律賓，更於百年前對中國伸出魔手，如此僅二三百年，佔據東亞大半，巧施種種謀略，使在東亞各民族分裂對立。於此英美所謂「分割支配」政策，欺瞞東亞民衆，英美之通訊制　，雖因近來無綫電訊之不通　而崩其一角矣，彼等則復作成世界通訊聯盟，仍能完全獨霸東亞之通訊權，近年來東亞之報紙對於彼等所供給之消息，殆有不能自由加以取捨剪削之勢，如此吾等雖　集於東亞，而對此之款目幾不能相互而視，又因此謀略宣傳更種下可鷩相的互誤解，以致彼此均被陷於孤立境地，此等情形，蓋實即近數年來之事也。</p>
<p>大東亞戰</p>
<p>爭爆發之前，彼等以爲不用武力，即可使保衛東亞之日本屈節，乃一面以經濟封鎖以圖要脅，一面以謀略宣傳即以所謂包圍陣對日本加以種種威嚇壓迫，此外復在東京上海，馬尼刺，新加坡，盤谷等地公然設立大規模之宣傳機關，展開積極之宣傳攻勢。此等事實想尙爲各位所記憶者。然日本畢竟不甘於侵略者，對此等壓迫乃毅然崛起，遂有大東亞戰爭之爆發，正大光明之戰爭目的及大東亞各民族齊相協力上之大東亞建設，即爲摧毀敵人一切謀略宣傳最有力之證明，如此吾等東亞人在通訊報道上，亦已自東亞將英美勢力完全驅出，東亞之事實已得由東亞人之手報道，東亞之主張，已得由東亞人傳播給東亞，以致全世界。即關於外國事件，亦當可將東亞人之目力所及者，與東亞人之手所　集刊之於報端，傳之於東亞各民族，吾人之報道言論，現時不僅立足於正確光明正義者且吾人此種正確報道與言論，確信卽爲新　序之。</p>
<p>金石動力</p>
<p>敵人今因於戰爭慘敗，在其報道宣傳上，雖欲掩飾其此種焦慮氣氛而終不可能，蓋彼等於其國民之前始終極力掩飾其敗戰事實，而恐共國民發生不安，但彼等國內之動搖苦境雖極謀掩蔽，亦終不能免其　露於吾人之前也。對此我大東亞則日滿日泰之提携，愈越緊密，中日之間亦已締結新同盟條約，又緬甸·菲律賓已見諸獨立，印度納西亞亦得到參政權，甚至自由印度臨時政府亦終見誕生，至本月五日，更有大東亞會議，大東亞宣言已堂堂宣布於世人之前，其主旨所在，即爲大東亞各國互相提携，防禦英美之侵略，完成大東亞之建設，俾貢獻確立世界和平，是以制定建設大東亞綱領五原則，以之宣布於中外。此大東亞宣言，誠乃昭示大東亞各民族共同理想有史以來罕見之偉大文字，內容絕無似敵英美之空幻言辭，而純係以大東亞之現實根據，且相信此以道義爲基礎之大東亞</p>
<p>建設綱領</p>
<p>乃世界全人類之至上目標，故此大東亞宣言，即乃完遂大東亞戰爭與建設大東亞之根本。今大東亞之新聞界已集結一體，不僅應將大東亞宣言綱領中所示之建設大東亞理想竭力使宣揚於中外，同時並啓發各地域之人心，以謀此理想之實現，此亦即大東亞新聞記者所負之最光榮使命，謹此對各位之奮鬥表示敬意外，並祈今後勇往邁進。</p>
<h3>松村部長演說　竭力爭取勝利</h3>
<p>砲聲中的血盟</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日陸軍報道部長松村秀　氏，於大東亞新聞大會席上發表演說，要旨如次：「有朋自遠方來不亦樂乎」，諸君均知此爲二千五百年前中國至聖孔子之言，余今站在此地講壇上，目睹來自大東亞遠方各地之諸君，歡聚一堂，情形極爲和靄，而不禁深感「不亦悅乎」。吾等向來晤面，但相處之和靄，宛如知己，然而吾人此種友情，在承平時代社交場所旣未能表現，在酒席之間亦難表現，而在砲聲隆隆大東亞戰爭進行中，却充分表現，誠所謂鐵血陣營中之血盟，亦即在解放大東亞之正義戰爭中所結成之戰友友情也。然則吾人過去爲何不能相倚相扶，向共榮之大道邁進，此不外亞洲之侵略者英美以壓迫之手段妨害吾人之相倚相扶也，英國曾於三百年前着手侵略印度，荷蘭亦向爪　，西里伯，繼之於中國，亞洲之　劇，實發生於此。美國自百年前在加里福尼亞發現金礦以來，其關心即集中於太平洋方面，竭力欲分割已化爲歐洲各國市場之亞洲，故意發動戰爭，以惡辣之手段，使非島人民供其犧牲，而從西班牙手中奪取　洲，作爲榨取東亞之立足點，英美以漠視人道之舉動及戰爭，在亞洲各地懸起英美國旗，我亞洲人均熱望得有一日由我亞洲人之手卸下侵略者之國旗，而代之以亞洲國旗。</p>
<p>亞洲已不衰弱</p>
<p>英美因嫉視日本之興隆，故每事加以壓迫，並煽動渝蔣從事排日，侮日，遂引起中日事變。歐戰發生後，彼等更變本加厲，遂對日本廢　通商條約，凍結資金，竟施以與戰爭無異之經濟壓迫，日本愈　忍自重，則彼等愈變本加厲，且欲亦淪亞洲於殖民地之地位，於是日本迫不得已，乃爲自衛計，毅然倔起，以從東亞驅出彼等侵略者，此在英美實出意外。良以彼等仍作昔日之迷　，以爲亞洲仍衰弱如昔，然時至今日，亞洲非昔日之亞洲，日本亦非昔日之日本，今日之日本，具有在東亞建設新秩序之實力決意。大東亞戰爭旣起，爲時僅及半載，已將侵略者驅出東亞，而亞洲各國或直接參戰或協力作戰，時至今日，理想相倚者已相倚，理想忊扶者已相扶，打成一片，爲保衛東亞起見，而勇躍負起擊破侵略者反攻之任務，此次戰爭若吾人失敗，則亞洲難獲解放，亞洲者若不得解放，則無自主獨立之光榮，其時亞洲將永淪爲侵略者之奴隸，故吾人應排除一切困難，竭盡全力，爭取最後勝利。大東亞會議所通過之大東亞共同宣言，大東亞建設要綱中五項原則，即共存共榮，獨立親和，闡揚文化，繁榮經濟，貢獻世界進展，其已形成新世界之新秩序，吾人今已打成一片，成爲一體，爲大東亞全體民族興亡而戰，今後更應努力以赴，爭取最後勝利。</p>
<p>大會含意深長</p>
<p>然而加　亞洲十億民衆之團結，强化彼此之親密之關係者，實係諸君之筆，蓋決戰下所負之使命，極其重大也，余認爲在此種意義上，今日之大東亞新聞大會，在作戰上含意實極深長，大東亞建設要綱中之此五項原則，並非如英美充作欺騙之口頭禪，吾人現已實行，且亦具有實踐正義之行動。新聞記者眼光實極尖銳，諺語有謂「百聞不如一見」，聞大會閉幕之後，諸君將暫　留日本參觀，願諸君以尖銳之眼光廣為觀　，且諸君頂定參觀陸軍士官學校，飛行學校，飛機工塲，想屆時諸群必能獲悉日軍因何致强。又日陸軍飛機因何致强，想諸君於參觀工塲時，必能實地目覩日本飛機增產之神速，余願諸君對精神之訓練加以留心，俾知日本之武係神之武，日本之剛係除邪顯正之正義之剛，余願借諸君之筆使「正義必勝」之日本一億國民之信念，成爲亞洲十億民衆之信念，余顯亞洲之筆與正義之剛常在一起，爲打倒宿敵英美而團結亞洲一切之力量。</p>
<p>田代中佐演說</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營海軍報道部田代中佐，代表海軍報道部長於新聞大會席上演說，其要旨如次：今歐亞戰況之益形熾烈，無庸贅言，必要而與激烈之武力戰併行，敵我之思想戰及　方之謀略戰，亦甚活潑。當此時期，大東亞各國各地域之新聞通訊社代表來東京會集一堂，本日於此舉行「大東亞新聞大會」，實具深刻意義，其使命亦極重大，吾等衷心希望各代表能開誠交換意見，相互砥礪，向共同目標邁進，對外粉碎敵國謀略，內則使大東亞十億民衆愈益緊密團結，發揮偉大之綜合威力，關於此點，吾等對本大會抱有甚大之期待，新聞通訊報道，於平時與戰時所負之任務自異，且戰時於其發揮機能上，尙有幾多平時想像不及之困難，然於另一方面吾人相信，今日方爲從事此種工作最有價值之時期，希望新聞通訊記者各位所寫之每一個字，均充滿歷史氣魄，須使每日之報紙，成爲轉換世界之泉源。</p>
<p>粉碎敵人謀略</p>
<p>吾人究應如何粉碎敵人謀略，應以何種態度對付敵人之謀略，兩點略述已見如下：首須鞏固內部之團結，自各方面充分活用頭腦，努力昂揚該各國國民志意，同時加强大東亞各民族之協力，不得忘却偉大之共同戰爭目標，應使之愈趨明確。大東亞共同宣言五大原則，即大東亞各民族公正之戰爭目標，新聞通訊機關，當須使此種旨　徹底普及於大東亞全域，以之啓發民衆，築成禦防敵人謀略之堅固要　，余認爲我人須共同盡力謀求實現此立足道義之五大原則，然於此最須留意之點，即五大原則之實現，「即大東亞之建設」與完成大東亞戰爭，亦有不可分之連帶關係。因此大東亞共同宣言之前文中規定，大東亞各國相互提携完成大東亞戰爭，無論如何，戰爭勝利乃爲第一條件，結局一切目標，均須集中於此思想戰鬥武力戰，亦一而二，二而一之關係。諸君爲思想之鬥士，故切望諸君留意此點，努力於指導與論及每日之消息，一切使之戰力化，更須全力使大東亞之人的要素與物的資源完全戰力化，目前言論報道機關之最大任務，亦須本此路綫向前推進。</p>
<p>堅固必勝信念</p>
<p>最後吾願吿諸君，我等持有「我力戰絕對勝利」之堅固信念，敵人之反攻至愈激烈，然我國之實力於敵軍反攻規模愈大時，愈可收獲偉大戰果，然論　國如何誇示其生產力，於彼等每次反攻時必因我軍收獲大戰果而崩潰，不久戰爭將有一大轉機，敵軍於我將兵忠誠勇武之精神下，唯有屈服，相信大東亞戰爭勝利之日，必將與大東亞新秩序實現之日同時來臨，均望諸君堅固此必勝之信念，於歸國後分別發揮國民完成戰爭之決意。</p>
<h3>德必能把握時機　保持光榮勝利　郭培爾發表演說</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾於星期一晚在柏林北部之國社黨大會中發表演說稱，德國之生存與德國在世界所佔之地位，爲此次戰事之主題，渠並表示對德國最後勝利之信念。郭培爾出席該會，事出突然，因於事前並不預料。渠討論戰事問題遂兩小時之久，渠稱，若德國人民決心利用每一機會，則吾人必可獲勝，惟問題在如何振作吾人之精神，直至勝負判別復始敢放下其武器。過去四年來德軍所獲光榮之勝利，已奠就最後勝利之基礎，目前之任務，即在設法保護之。郭培爾旋追述國社黨爭取政權之歷史稱，取得政權較德國在戰事中保持其地位之工作更爲艱難，但吾人具有堅忍忠誠與不可動搖之信念，遂獲最後之勝利，故此次戰事之結果，亦必爲吾人對投遞員之勝利。</p>
<h3>到德里去！印度國民軍的怒吼</h3>
<p>— 今井正剛</p>
<p>一面新的國旗</p>
<p>德里在戰慄着。</p>
<p>飄揚在德里的印度總督官邱之上的英國國旗，現在在恐怖的風聲中哆嗦着。</p>
<p>那旗曾在香港被踏在日軍的靴下。那是在新加坡扯白旗時和普基台馬山落日一同落下的旗。現在，那又是屢戰屢北的老大帝國，在其所剩的最後寶庫中，用着渾身的力，拚命地揭起着的旗。而印度四億民衆現在正爲了這旗，在反抗和咒阻之上，帶着血腥氣，號叫著。</p>
<p>今有一面新的旗，浩浩蕩蕩的向在這血腥氣的旋風中叫嗦着的英國旗，開始反抗的進攻。樺色·白色·和綠色。上面的樺色，象徵勇氣和犧牲，中間的白色象徵純正和融洽，下面的綠色，象徵眞實和武士道精神。那旗上面，畫著一輛「紡車」，表現自由的印度，獨立的印度之民族的光榮。四億民衆，在這旗下流着血，誓欲從英國的手中奪囘祖國的獨立，的確，這旗是從世界動亂的血雨中，產生出來的民族之旗。揭起這旗的是印度國民軍。</p>
<p>昭和十八年十月二十四晶，昭南島的自由印度臨時政府，在這光榮的印度獨立旗下，堂堂的對英美佈吿宣戰。開始進攻的號令已下了。向著他們所愛的祖國，爲了祖國的自由和獨立，印度國民軍揭竿而起，進向祖國的首都，「有悠久歷史的赤色要塞」。「進向德里！」「向德里進攻呀！」</p>
<p>駐緬甸的日軍，在此之先，早已開始行動。遠入中國西南部的雲南，對南下增强中的渝軍與以殲滅的打擊，遮斷重慶，英印間的戰略路，雨季過去之前，先已獲得先發制人的大戰果。半年來，掩設緬甸。印度國境的濃密　霉雨，現在變成了美麗而晴朗的天空了。那歡迎印度國民軍的祖國河山，閃照着灼熱的陽光，替他們開了進攻的路途。本年春，在門道河流域一帶展開阿拉貢悲劇的舞臺，現在重又成爲世界注視之的。雨季已過，南國的太陽，照明着這舞臺，現在立於這舞臺之上，將高奏凱歌的主演者，顯出了雄偉的·美麗的全貌，立在舞臺的上塲門。</p>
<p>民族英雄乘時崛起</p>
<p>自從本年夏聽到江特拉·鮑斯的名字，「現在在東京」的時候，德里開始戰慄了。德里的榨取者們，看見在自己脚下，以鮑斯之名爲中心，印度四億民衆，團結而武裝起來了·恐怖·戰慄，這不是　魘，也不是幻影，而是迅速地現實化起來的事實。僑居東亞各地的二百萬印度人們，歡呼地聚集到鮑斯所指定的地方。在香港，在廣東，在西貢，在昭南，印度國民軍陸陸續續地編成了。　喜之色益於眉宇的靑年們，相繼共同參加了誓爲他們的祖國而流血。鮑斯七月二日從東京到昭南，在出迎的印度國民軍儀仗兵之前，出現其雄偉的驅體。靑年的熱情革命家的雙眸中，流著感動和感謝的熱淚，大叫着：「—我們的獨立鬥爭唯一缺乏的東西，乃是用於對英鬥爭的武力。現在諸君成為愛國的鬥士，而把武力給與我們了。」並握着一共流着熱淚的兵士們之手。能救印度的一代人物，在這裏方才見到了期待甚久的自己的軍隊，這軍隊共慶得人而奪起，敬仰之爲統帥。繼於五晶，鮑斯統帥在數萬機械化兵團的印度國民軍閱兵式臺上宣稱：「能解放印度的軍隊，不是在曾爲英國的根據昭南嗎？現在我們的口號是：到德里去！到德里去！！」明確地指示出進攻的道路。六日，東條首相親自檢閱這國民軍，聲明日本爲印度獨立，不惜給與全面支援。八日當時的印度獨立聯盟本部，關於印度國民軍的組織，發表如次：</p>
<p>名稱　稱印度國民軍。</p>
<p>目的　驅逐英美勢力，使印度成爲眞正印度人的印度。</p>
<p>建軍宗旨　印度國民軍屬於印度獨立聯盟，國民軍將士以聯盟的指導方針團結，信義，犧牲爲信條，向討英獨立的大目標結合起來，向前邁進，以貫澈此目的。</p>
<p>組織　印度國民軍根據志願兵制度選撥討英獨立精神熱烈的鬥士組織。打破被英國的分割統治所造成的之民族的宗敎的惡弊。敎育訓練以東亞印度人的本來習慣爲基本，軍用語採用印度斯坦語。</p>
<p>和日本軍的關係　照同盟國軍隊一樣</p>
<p>從這發表中可知印度國民軍的性質業已確，進攻德里的準備也已完全完成。以步兵爲中心，並有〇〇兵，砲兵，工兵，通信兵等諸部隊。陣容嚴整的機械化兵團，士氣激昂，其兵力共〇萬。</p>
<p>十月二十一日，印度獨立聯盟發展而樹立自由印度臨時政府。沒有寸土的這政府，以印度國民軍爲主軸，在同一的呼聲，同一的意志下，出發打到　敵英國。這戰鬥政府經日本及各軸心國政府的承認，至十月二十四日，佈吿對英美宣戰。進攻的喇叭在響着，樺色和白·綠的獨立旗矗立在新的東亞風雲中。</p>
<p>大民族劇的最高潮</p>
<p>繼最近即將上演的「阿拉貢悲劇」第二幕之後，這偉大的民族劇正在準備描寫這感動的最高潮之第三幕。那是龐大的號稱三百五十萬英印軍的崩潰，和印度軍的對國民軍合流。一七五七年蒲拉茲希之戰中初次使用的印度人部隊，一七九六年有六萬七千人，第一次大戰中，在法國前綫的有步兵，騎兵各二師團，野戰砲兵四旅團，連派至非洲，巴爾幹的合計起來，共戰鬥員五十五萬，共戰鬥員三十九萬，正是英國的寶庫。</p>
<p>此次大東亞戰爭中，現在英印軍可分爲國境守備軍，國內治安軍，沿岸警備軍，海外派遣軍，預備軍五種。此外另有輕戰車，裝甲汽車三萬二千的騎馬裝甲車隊，機械化野戰砲兵隊，機械化工兵隊。空軍有萊森　偵察隊，伐倫帶轟炸隊。蒲倫哈姆轟炸戰。一九三八年却特　爾特所計劃的五年計劃，因大戰爆發而迅速實現，據稱將近目標三百五十萬人。這大軍在一九〇五年分割孟加拉，一九一九年的阿姆里札屠殺，一九二一年的不服從運動中，反英空氣日見高漲，崩壞之期，即在目前。繼一九三四年的貝戛華爾叛亂，此次大戰中伊　派雷斯泰因派遣軍的叛亂，在這大崩潰的旋風中，迎接這印度軍的進攻。這實是近世最大的戰鬥時，而爲將在現世界中展開的印度四億人民的大民族劇。而那幕已經揭開了。（翔：　自十一月七日朝日週刋）</p>
<h3>戈美爾德軍擊退　蘇鉗形攻勢　基輔西大戰進行中</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據海通社訊：聶泊河中部以西，在過去二十四小時內仍在激戰中，齊托密爾附近蘇軍仍企圖擴　楔形地，戰局無變化，德軍仍繼續進攻蘇軍南翼，於前日在齊托密爾東南，佔領蘇軍陣地數處。蘇軍增加對柯洛斯頓之壓力，但進展甚微，柯洛斯頓·齊托密爾·法斯托夫之三角形中，戰事依然激烈。聶伯河河套戰況亦劇烈，蘇軍在克里　洛格以北，企圖以精銳部隊突破德軍陣地，德軍不僅防禦，且反攻數次，目前勢均力敵不相上下。聶伯河下流克里米亞附近及寇許半島，戰況無變化。戈美爾方面蘇軍於前日繼續進攻，顯欲自南北兩面，以鉗形戰略進攻該城。德軍砲隊在　爾廈以東，協力阻止蘇軍之進攻，戰局亦無變化</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據海通社訊：戈美爾方面蘇軍迄未達到軍略上之目的，敵軍企圖切斷戈美爾與勒契　間之交通綫，但經劇戰並未實現。戈美爾以北紅軍之進攻均被擊退。</p>
<h3>德軍採避離行動　準備明年大決戰</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：關於德軍在東綫各點繼續撤退，避不與蘇軍作決定性之戰　，而當蘇軍密集攻擊時，即逐漸放棄土地，此種行動乃德軍依照一定之目的，蘇軍即因此在夏季攻勢未能　到目標，秋季之攻勢亦復如是。現已進入冬季戰爭之階段，而敵人仍未能如德軍一九四一至四二之大戰一樣，使德軍陷於殲滅之一戰。基補區及齊托密爾區之戰事，適足證明此項見解。在過去四個月之蘇軍鉗形運動，德軍對之初則竭力抵抗，繼則削弱其實力，終則避離敵軍而進至新陣地，故今年蘇軍作戰從未有能完成者。但德軍界方面現仍力持緘默，仍不討論德軍後備隊在東綫使用之地點，雖現可確定其有充足之後備兵力足資調遣，雖對於歐陸其他戰場之重要因子及可能之危機，亦未加以宣揚，而未審在於何地何時此高度發展之歐洲軍事工業始發揮其威力，此一定依照其廣泛之計劃以退讓其土地，此係德軍準備於一九四四年以整個軍事機構之全力，對敵人於決定性之戰鬬中作集中之軍事打擊。以此種角度觀察，則敵人所謂取得主動而不知其主動，適與德軍之計劃相符合。</p>
<h3>西班牙藍師團　自東綫撤回</h3>

<h3>松島報道部長　昨晚廣播　「太平洋戰局之急轉直下」</h3>
<p>中央社訊　南太平洋方面日美空戰日見激烈，日航空部隊連日向敵展開猛鬥，予以重大創傷，戰果輝煌，先後經日大本營絡續發表，日駐華艦隊報道部長松島慶三大佐，特於十六日夜七時二十分，在大東廣播電台，就此次波根維爾海戰第一次至第四次空戰意義加以說明，暴露連戰連敢之敵美狠狽醜態，題為「太平洋戰局之急轉直下」，歷時二十分鐘，玆誌其要旨如次：</p>
<p>戰事在猛烈展開中</p>
<p>英美之反抗在過去一年半以內，始終集中於所羅門方面，尤以最近數月來，敵以空軍及水上艦艇協同作戰，漸相接近我方之戰略圈，其戰况之進展，由於我方之公正報道，已可明瞭。我海軍精銳部隊，卒於此際在波根維爾島之一角，發揚晴天霹靂大戰果、掃除太平洋上之陰翳暗雲，此即係十月二十七日展開摩納島方面空載以來，波根維爾島海戰及自第一次至第四次波根維爾島海面空戰之戰果，戰事現仍在猛烈展開中。</p>
<p>美首腦部手足無措</p>
<p>故決算該方面之戰果，雖似過早，然在此期間內，日方戰果。究如何重大，此可觀於美海單首腦部之手足無措，急遽召集首腦部會議，於十四日發表改編太平洋艦隊，採用歷史上最大戰術即可測知一斑。在此期間內，敵美遭受慘痛損害，故念需更新太平洋戰棧，由此可證明美海軍所遭受損害之大，實為共歷史上之第一次，即自摩納島附近展開空戰以來，敵美艦船之進擊沉或擊毀者達七十艘以上，飛機之遭擊落擊毀者達五百卅架以上，集結於該方面之其主力部隊大半恐已毀減，共兵員方面之損害亦在二萬以上。美海軍部長諾克斯對於我方發表，於十一月十日竟稱日本之主張，絕不眞確，事實設果如此，則當無再改編太平洋艦隊之必要矣。美海軍將兵，遭受歷史上空前未有之犧牲，其勇鬥猛戰，竟為諾克斯所一筆抹殺，美國內部，對其海軍當局忽視事實之發表，大為憤激，目下動搖端緒已露，不久當可眞相大白矣。在十一月之初，</p>
<p>戰局重大奮往邁進</p>
<p>波根維爾島攻擊戰未會展開之先，曾稱巳予日本以重大打舉，然至卞三日會見記者時，忽又承認日軍在南太平洋方面具有得以迅速補很飛機之利，更稱日軍在其他戰綫無需多大空軍，故得以將全力集中於南太平洋云云。至英國對於日軍此次戰果亦喪恐懼，並稱美國對於日本航空部隊之估價完全過低，承認美飛行戰術巳起一大　落。羅斯福會稱。波根維爾島之上陸作戰，英美聊合軍原不願採用飛行戰術，然為佔領攻擊拉巴爾基地起見，乃不得已而出而一戰云，由此可推知敵方企圖奪還拉巴爾之切，該方面戰局之重大，由此亦不難想像，吾人自須萬衆一心，為徹底擊減英美而奮往邁進，非獲得最後勝利。斷不罷手。</p>
<h3>滬西兩期口粉　盼速領購</h3>
<p>本市滬西區第二十一期戶。麵粉，頃悉，滬西區公聊聯合辦事處方面，將於最短期內開始繳款手續，故尙未領購第十九·二十兩期口粉者，務希迅即領購，以免逾期作廢，並延遲下期口粉之發售日期。</p>

<h3>節約運動口號標語</h3>
<p>（二）關於「衣」方面者</p>
<p>「祗重衣衫不電人」是勢利小人的想念。</p>
<p>穿舊衣應受尊敬。</p>
<p>艷裝華服人人卑視。</p>
<p>中絲半縷恒念物力維誤。</p>
<h3>保甲方面製定　防空指導要綱　（上）</h3>
<p>飭有關各方面切實遵照</p>
<p>保甲方面頃印定「防空指導要項第九號，」張貼為參考之用，其內容謂：「經此次召開之防空連絡會議議決之各案件中，下開各項為應付目前之時勞起見，求其從速實現及準備，尤為緊要，希即飭令右關各方面，切實遵辦，毋勿疏忽為要。</p>
<p>避難所</p>
<p>計開：一，防空避難所，　公共避難所之指定，前由各分局依據乙字第二號醫防所報告，指定為避難所之建築物，應請第一區公署工務處負資人員查騐核准後，方可正式指定，在經指定為避難所之建築物上。應懸掛如下圖之旗幟、以資織別，夜問則應燃點綠電燈，其上部則應加眾，予以遮蓋，以免透漏光終至上空，但在未經該署工務處核准前，倘遇發生不測事故。則照前例使用前設之公共避難所。（圖略）　公共防空　之設置，依據第一項。　家庭避難所之設置，應在嚴內選擇較安全之地點　設置是項避難所，一經接到警戒警報後。應速將被褥毛毯蓆子等物圍繞四周，以防危險，也容易顛落或很毀之家具一切用品，應在平時預先搬至另室保存，倘欲在建築物外之花園或空地等處築構是項防空壕時　亦須先得工務處之指導並核准。</p>
<p>櫥窗貼紙</p>
<p>二·促進玻璃櫥窗黏貼防碎紙條事項。查各方面雖已遵照辦理，也尚有一部分仍未實行。應嚴加餐促，飭令辦理，毋須玩忽延吳，至於黏貼紙條方法，應力求實際有效，即以滿四公分之紙條每隔十公分交鉗黏貼成方格形，紙條兩端則應於窗框密點，但已經黏貼完竣而不合上聞規定者，共從新黏貼與否，則總其便，不得強制。</p>
<p>三，自來水停止供給時應準備事項，在警戒警報發出後，應預防因空襲而停止供給自來水之可能，故在接獲警戒警報後，應立即盡量預備飲料水。為準備　充飲料水起見，應在該管區域內事前調查有無可供欽用之水井。</p>
<p>識別標記</p>
<p>四，携帶識別標記事項，為便利不測事故發生後之識別起見，警戒警報發出後，全市人民應隨身拂帶布製標記，以資判別，該項標記應詳細指明各人之姓名及住址，且為避免遺失因靈動而致衣服破砟每情起見。應牢縫夾眞或腰帶等比較妥穩之處。</p>
<p>交通整理</p>
<p>五，警報發出後之交通整理事項，査警報發出後，屢有在各路口張繩禁止通行等情，倘遇空襲，此等行為當有增加被損害之可能，故嗣後應極力避免之，伹沿人行道張繩管理交總。則不在此限，至於因警備事故須要戒嚴時，則仍照前例。</p>
<p>電話應用</p>
<p>六，警報發生後一切不緊要電話應停止通用，警戒警報發出半小時內，除有關警報之外一切不緊要之電話，應停止使用，又在空襲警報發出時問內，除有關警報以外之一切不緊要電話，亦不得使用。</p>
<p>避難法</p>
<p>七，關於避難應注意事項，為減輕過襲時被損起見，應採取分散避難方法，避雛者如發視其附近地被轟炸時，應即赴該處從事消防及其他積極工作，不應採取以保護大衆安全為目的之構築設備完全之大規模避難所等類之消極方法，但對於老叟童幼及罹病老，應事先導至鄰近安全之避難所避難。</p>

<p>八區配給證</p>
<p>中華日報問：本市第八區居民，在本區內遷移時，新址戶口已經報八二星期後，適逢發給物品配給證，結果未能領得，請問第八區保甲處對於戶口遷移後，領取配給證有無規定期限？可否申請補發？第八區保甲辦事處答：保甲處分發物品配給證，係由糧食配給處根據戶口記錄將證交下轉發，凡未右配錄者，自未能領得，配給日期因糧食來源及辦理手續關係，不易規定。又補發問題因數量右定，亦難辦到。</p>
<p>滬西戶口移動</p>
<p>中央社上海分社問：滬西戶口移動，侮於呈報後相隔兩月，尚未領到購米證麵粉證，易啓居民對經辦人員（如保長）之誤會，可否規定一適當期限。俾各知所進循。糧食局答：查申請米糧除特殊情形者外，上月呈報到局，下月即可配發，大　居民於呈報戶口後，於一個半月後，即可領到購米賺　粉證，若居民仍未領得或有何問題，可向糧食局詢問淸楚。第一警察局保甲處答：滬四保甲巳於上星期辦理交接手續，併入第一警局保甲處營鐵，今後對居民移動申報，已　令西區辦事處轉飭各保甲長儘量迅速辦理，對於購米證及麵粉證，當與糧食當局會查共原因，務使弊絕風淸。</p>
<p>北站駐警檢査</p>
<p>中央社上海分社問：北火車站駐警，近由第一警局派出檢查視前益為嚴刻，旅客每受過份留難，公務人員亦須排陸　候，且往往右流氓結夥預佔站立地位，向旅客素贊出讓等情事，市民對此嘖右煩言，僉認為租界收囘後不應有之現象，未悉警察當局有改善意向否？第一警察局答：　對於公務員特別通行一節，已由本局呈請市府批准身份證明之統一辦法。　流氓之取締，已由本局飭令該管分局，予以嚴格之取締。　中央社聯紛員之特別通行一節，恐與其他方面發生誤會，故請向該管分局（四紅口分局）商議予以特別便利。</p>
<p>中央社上海分社問：第一區公署轄境，愛文義路口及靜安寺路口，均有保壘，似在戰事發生時所股，惟至今尚未拆除，而警務處派有俄捕及警察多人，常川駐守，對於夾往行人，荀　帶日用物品，不問其是否統制品、輙隨時留難，此糧情形警務當局，有所聞見否，能否加以密査從嚴取締，以杜此風？第一警察局答：愛文義路兀安寺路鐵絲網於警戒上論、目前不能撤隊，對於警察之不法行為，當嚴責各該管責任者嚴格取締外，如有此等事實時，請通知本局，又滬西及前三局歸併後，對於警戒綫之整理，目前正在計劃中。</p>
<p>更換路名牌</p>
<p>中華日報問：本市路名前經市府改定，惟因緣用已久，積習難除，且各處舊路名牌，尚未更易。未悉當局對此有若何當澈實行之措置否？工務局答：工務局已與第一八兩區公署會商，定十二月一日動工，做新的路牌計劃，正面標明新路名，後面仍附舊名，至明年三月底，再將後面之舊名除去。</p>
<p>食油四百餘噸充作戶口油</p>
<p>茲據食油配給方面消息，本市戶口油因軍配給拼理移交關係，停頓已久，茲聞有關當局，以市民需耍股切，不容再緩，近特向前軍配組商借食油四百餘噸，充作戶口油之用，故一俟價格問題解決後，即可開始發售，又據道德油廠某君云，最近食沒自由流通頗為圓滑，尤以日來各產區因深恐統制運滬者更見增多，故供應殊形充裕。</p>
<h3>一區電車　加價說不確　尙有切實考慮必要</h3>
<p>中央社訉　關於一區電車將於今日起增加車資問題，外界傳說紛紜，昨據記者向該電車當局探悉，對修正車價，尚有切實考慮之必要，一時尚未付諸實施，故對外傳今日起漲價一事，全屬無稽。</p>

<p>其次，在指導的立塲，自租界消減以後，中日變方人事上交往益密，關於經濟知織之研究，金融政策之樹立，統製工作之運用等，均非深切理解不可，而理解之要點，會語通達，實為急要，遺是當前未可忽視的一件事。</p>
<p>中日經濟提携，誰都希望有圓滿的成果，而現時現地經濟知識經騐的攝取，各項專長技能的磨鍊，均為當前要務，如何促進理解，溝通語言，使工作能中肯綮，圓滑推動，是大家所應共同努力者。（節譯十一月十五日支那情報）</p>

<h3>紗布配給的商榷</h3>
<p>— 陳世聰</p>
<p>自國防會翻決，收買紗布迄今，已述四月有餘，在紗布將配給的前夕，我們必須經鄭重的檢討，紗布的配給，不比別的日用品，那麼單純，而是一件非常繁　的工作，種種部門，必須經專家議定，例如：由原棉向產地徵集，發給紗廠紡紗，就有棉統會的產生，規劃一切。爰將余所淸悉之織遺廠業，紗布配給方案，中述一二，以供當局，有以採</p>
<p>在收買工作完成後，紗布收買辦事處，便即解散，而改爲一紗布配給處置的機關，這是一個非常簡檯的辦法。該機關將現有之存紗或紗廠之新生產，直接配給布廠及針織廠商，則向有之紗號業，勢必淘汰，不過該業之含有投機性嚴重，爲欲增强配給機構健全，减輕市民負担起見，該業實屬有取締之必要。試觀在商統會尚未成立之初，與商統會成立後之入紗號業會員相比，數量增加一倍有餘，蓋因入會員有草申請移出紗綫之權，故一般實力較足之紗號，即化二三牌號入會，以謀多享移出之利，雖不可一體而言，不過大多若此，如此之伸縮自由，欲求其不會投機也，難矣。</p>
<p>布廠業會員，有七百一餘家，針織廠及棉織廠，一更不在少數，倘由各廠直接申請配紗，確是不勝其繁，配給與公會，再由公會韓配與會員廠商罷！難一免弊端百出。故現時布廠業有劃區分維之籌備，即一以若千家小型廠商，就地區相近，意氣相投之各廠，聯合組成一個集團，推舉一組長，配給紗綫由其認領，苒由其韓發與其所屬各廠，如此則大多鄰近，日夕相見之同業，故我可斷言，決無作弊之事產生。由此，並可使一般向無聯合作之各廠，練習一種團結合作之精神，例如：一家十數臺織機之章商履用一個捧經員有餘，若二十餘臺織機者，則爲不足，二個便是有　，其他若翻紗等等，一毫五十錠的簡子車，須有三人至四人工作，若動用人數不須此數，則馬達照常須開一只，今經此集　組織，則便可相互聯絡，人力物力，均可節省，與今戰事統制經濟，確有俾益，其他若技術合作，改良產品，提携督促，尤其餘事也</p>
<p>配給後，由當局指定劃一織造，製成品後，更經當局收買，配給各處，此種步驟，恐非盡善，蓋人力　力，兩不經濟，配紗配綫，據何爲準，技術能否統一，均成問題，蓋白坏廠多以紗爲經，色貨廠都以雙股綫爲經，因色貨廠均無漿缸及噴霧機之裝置，故不若先由各廠申請配給一二個月之需用紗綫，盡其所長，織遣各項　物，由當局　定價格後，向市推銷出賣，成交後向當局由積移動，囡各另售商採購量必有劃一之規定，其必還品種優良，價格公道，市民需要之貨買進，如此，則各廠　必競爭。改進製品，情該廠之出品，價高貨劣，其必乏人間津，倘其用卑劣手段，作非法交易，便無申請移出之證件，况當局可隨時查檢處罰。故其欲請求第二期配給紗綫，則必舍其减價合法售去第一期之產品後，方可申請，一如是，則不特能改良新產品，並可收仰平物價之成效，淺膚之見，未識善否，有冀指正。</p>
<p>他若配給量多寡，據何標準，照織機臺數分派，抑或照保留額依據，常由岔局內定之。</p>

<h3>籲請肺科醫師　集體爲病家服務</h3>
<p>生病是苦事，生肺病更苦。曠時費錢而外，有時候還得不到最合理的洽療，或者失掉早期治療的機會。</p>
<p>請教了醫生總是最合理的治療了吧？最不會失掉早期治療的機會了吧？其實也不盡然。海上醫生醫術高低不一，即是專家診斷亦非盡同。譬如有這麼一個病人，甲說肺上有空洞，乙說沒有；甲說要開刀，乙說無須。又有這麼一個病人，甲說肺部等於無病，乙說有病，甚輕：丙說有病，較乙說爲重，了却說是進行性的。同一疾病，同一X光片子，可以有各種說法，各種診斷。那麼叫病人何所適從呢？</p>
<p>這情形非常普遍。初是我想：應該有一個集議一的組織了。聽說眼科醫生，就有這麼一個組織的。過到成問題的病案，就可以在經常的集會上加以討論。使病家得到最正確的指示，或者這樣的組織原是有的，只是沒有做得好，那麼就籲請執事的先生們拿出更多的力量來，爲病家服務！</p>

        <h1>1943.11.18</h1>
<h3>Welcome Chairman Bose</h3>
<p>After attending the Greater East Asia Conference, Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, is visiting our country via a detour to the capital city. We deeply admire this national hero who is fighting for the freedom and liberation of four hundred million Indian people.</p>
<p>India is an ancient country with a rich culture in the East. Its vast land, large population, and abundant resources rank second in Asia, making its position quite important. Unfortunately, it has suffered from the invasion of British imperialism, which has ruled it for over two hundred years. The Indian people are under the oppression of tyrannical power, and its history of more than two hundred years is stained with blood. Even today, most Indians are still enslaved and oppressed. This phenomenon is not only a disgrace to the Indian people but also a disgrace to all the people of Asia.</p>
<p>Britain extracts a vast amount of India's resources for the benefit of its own people and uses it as capital to invade other countries. Therefore, Britain regards India as its lifeline. In the past, Indian patriots have continuously launched revolutionary resistance movements, but they were crushed by the application of cruel high-pressure tactics. For example, last spring, when the then Indian national leader Gandhi and others broke off negotiations with the British envoy Cripps, they were arrested and imprisoned to this day. Other persecuted Indians have also been suppressed. But the Indian people's demand for freedom and liberation has become widespread and deeply rooted among the masses. Breaking free from Britain's shackles is only a matter of time. This is from the perspective of the internal factors of the Indian people, which has reached a point where liberation and self-help are indispensable.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of the external environment, the Allied Japan has launched the Greater East Asia War, assisting various ethnic groups and countries in their independence with the same enthusiasm. Mr. Bose, who has been a patriot fighting for Indian freedom for many years, has resolutely risen up and flown to Japan to openly discuss the matter with the Japanese authorities. It is natural for Mr. Bose to strive for the freedom of his motherland, to be courageous, and to never look back. It is also expected that Japan will practice the Greater East Asia Doctrine, adhere to the consistent policy of assisting the independence of various ethnic groups, and provide the utmost cooperation with enthusiasm. Therefore, Mr. Bose went to Syonan (Singapore) to organize the Provisional Government of India, was elected as its chairman, and organized the Indian National Army as a vanguard for the war against Britain.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Japan, and the heads of the administrative branches of various independent countries sent representatives to the conference. Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, was also invited to attend, which shows the importance of the Provisional Government of India in Asia. Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo's speech further emphasized Japan's support for India, stating: "Today, Britain's oppression of India is becoming increasingly severe. The suffering of the four hundred million Indian people cannot be described in words... All of us, the people of Greater East Asia, are filled with righteous indignation at the tragic situation in India. At the same time, we find it difficult to ignore this. Indian patriot Bose has resolutely risen up, and people both inside and outside India have responded accordingly. This shows that the establishment of the Indian government and the foundation of Indian independence have also been laid. The Empire has declared to China and foreign countries its determination to provide all cooperation and support for India's struggle for independence." Subsequently, Myanmar representative Ba Maw explained that Indian independence is closely related to the construction of Greater East Asia, stating that if India is not free, Asia will not be free, and appealed to all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia to provide comprehensive support for Indian independence.</p>
<p>Given the historical relationship between China and India, the common task of opposing Britain, and the common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War, we will inevitably provide the greatest cooperation with the most sincere enthusiasm for India's struggle for independence. This is the common intention of all Chinese people. We would like to dedicate this to Mr. Bose and express our welcome.</p>

<h3>National Health Conference Successfully Concludes Yesterday - Speaker Lu Runzhi Delivers Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday (the 17th) was the third day of the First National Health Administration Conference. At 9:00 AM, all members and medical experts from various regions, under the leadership of the Chairman of the General Assembly Lu and Secretary-General Lin, held the second plenary session in the Nanjing Hall of the China-Japan Cultural Association. The discussion concluded at 12:00 PM, and the closing ceremony was held immediately afterward. The closing remarks were delivered by Chairman Lu. After the speech, all member representatives nominated Hou Fusang, the representative from Tianjin, to deliver a reply, which was very sincere. At around 1:00 PM, the First National Health Administration Conference, aimed at unifying national health administration and ensuring national health, successfully concluded.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks by Chairman Lu Runzhi</p>
<p>The First National Health Administration Conference has come to a successful conclusion today. A total of 125 proposals were submitted, 123 of which were approved and 2 retained. The resolutions passed, in addition to improving the health administration organization and determining health administration funding, which belong to health administration itself and should be promoted for proper development, also include other cases such as cultivating specialized health personnel, expanding health work, strengthening epidemic prevention, and adjusting medical treatment, all of which are closely related to social welfare and health. However, of the matters promoted within the scope of health administration, most are related to consumption, and few focus on production. Therefore, regarding the part of the resolution concerning health funding, it still requires the sympathetic assistance of the central and local financial authorities, and it is expected that the provincial and municipal health administrators will work hard to ensure that this conference does not become a mere formality but a process of practice, marking a new era on the basis of the New National Movement. This would be the supreme glory of this conference, starting from today.</p>
<p>Instructions by Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Original text of the instructions by the Chairman at the first National Health Conference: (Continued from yesterday) Regarding medical equipment and medical materials mentioned above, even if there are means to purchase them, it is not easy to obtain money. I heard that many of the proposals at this conference are related to funding, which is naturally urgent, but since the return, for more than three years, although the financial situation has improved compared to before, the uses have also increased accordingly, and the financial situation is still very tight. Some people ask why we don't print more paper money. It is true that countries at war adopt paper money policies, but if too much paper money is issued, it will inevitably affect inflation, which will not alleviate the people's suffering but will exacerbate it. For example, if a civil servant's monthly salary is 100 yuan, it is impossible to maintain life when prices are high. If the government increases it to 250 yuan, then it can carry out the policy of increasing paper money issuance, which relies entirely on the people's surplus and willingness to enthusiastically buy government bonds. Because tax revenue is limited, it relies entirely on the people's willingness to purchase government bonds. The government, on the one hand, uses the paper money it issues, on the other hand takes it back from public prices. In this way, with one side of the issuance and the other side of the recalling, the currency circulates, and naturally, there will be no monetary inflation. China, for example, Shanghai, has hundreds of thousands of dollars of financial resources, but they use it without releasing it, and then the government bonds cannot be issued, and the paper money cannot be increased and issued.</p>
<p>In the end, the lack of material is still due to the lack of spirit. If there is patriotism in the spirit, and there is an organization based on patriotism, everything can still be done. Take medical talent as an example. China is indeed lacking in medical talent. Moreover, most of these few medical talents are concentrated in the cities. Because there are more wealthy people in the cities, they can afford expensive doctors and buy expensive medicine. As a result, the people of the rural areas have no way to benefit from modern medicine. Even in the cities, it is not as easy to hire a doctor in Nanjing as it is in Shanghai. If doctors are only the exclusive products of the wealthy people in the cities, and most people in the rural areas cannot get them, if they have illnesses or sufferings and cannot get relief, isn't this very heartbreaking?</p>
<p>I also know that a talented doctor can make more profit by engaging in private practice, and it is easy to do so. Engaging in health administration brings less profit and is more difficult. It is only when driven by patriotism and moved by the illnesses and sufferings of the majority of the people that one abandons the concept of private practice and engages in health administration. People like Dr. Li of the Central Hospital and Lu Shusheng of the Health Department are like this. I believe that within the country, there must be many medical talents with the same patriotism and the same compassionate heart to relieve the illnesses and sufferings of the majority of the people. This health administration conference is a gathering of these medical talents to bring out their patriotism and the compassion to relieve the sufferings of the majority of the people, and to gather together to jointly plan the improvement of the health administration organization, making it geographical and gradually popularizing it, so that even poor people across the country can gradually receive the benefits of modern medical science. This is the greatest goal of the health administration conference, and it is also the highest spirit that health administration should possess. I wish all of you good health and the progress of health administration.</p>

<h3>The Greater East Asia Press Conference Solemnly Opens in Japan Yesterday - Representatives from Six Countries and Seven Regions Gather Together</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Press Conference, sponsored by the Japan Newspaper Association, convened a preparatory meeting at 10:00 AM on the 17th, and the opening ceremony was held grandly at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. At the preparatory meeting in the afternoon, the agenda for the three-day conference was reviewed. Representatives from China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Myanmar, Java, and Celebes, as well as the sponsors' representatives, including Chairman Tanaka of the Newspaper Association, Executive Director Fuwa, and Director Okamura, conducted an informal working group negotiation for about two hours. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the conference opened. The Japanese flag was hung in the center below the main conference room, and the flags of the other five countries were placed alongside it. In front of the flags, on the left side were the representatives from the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Java, Malaya, Borneo, Sumatra, Ceylon, Celebes, and other regions, and on the right side were the representatives from China, Japan, and Thailand. More than 500 guests, including representatives from the Information Bureau, the Army and Navy, related government agencies, and friendly organizations, surrounded the area. The conference was declared open by the director of the Newspaper Association, Sakanari Renzo. After the ceremonial formalities, a silent prayer of gratitude was held for the war dead. Then, Chairman Tanaka delivered the opening address, followed by addresses or speeches by President Amou of the Information Bureau, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia, and the heads of the Army and Navy News Divisions. Foreign congratulatory telegrams were also read out. The atmosphere in the entire hall was extremely intense.</p>
<p>Opening Address by Chairman Tanaka of the Japan Newspaper Association</p>
<p>Chairman Tanaka Toyokichi of the Japan Newspaper Association delivered the following opening address: We are convening the Greater East Asia Press Conference with 82 representatives from the press of six independent countries and seven regions amidst an unprecedented great war. I am extremely pleased. Here, on behalf of the organizers, I would like to express my deepest respect to the representatives who have come from afar, and at the same time, express my deep gratitude to all those who have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend. The holding of this press conference was decided several months ago. Before our press conference, there was the Greater East Asia Conference, which can be called a historic conference. We feel very grateful and satisfied with the successful completion of that conference. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is an immortal document for all time, and the essence of East Asian morality it promotes does not need to be praised by me. In the eyes of us journalists, its significance is even greater. Greater East Asian journalists may have had some doubts in the past, but with the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we have obtained a clear and definite answer. It has made our awareness and our ideals unshakeable, and we feel extremely happy. Ladies and gentlemen, although the world is vast, we journalists have been able to gather in this glorious and happy place to discuss good strategies for achieving our mission. I am afraid that only we East Asian journalists have this. Therefore, I cannot help but feel deeply the importance of our journalists' mission and how precious the mission of the press is. Whether we are engaged in guiding domestic public opinion, or cooperating in the unity of the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, or working hard on foreign publicity, in all these aspects, our mission is no less than the military affairs of the soldiers on the front lines, and we all have the determination to do our utmost to complete this important task. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference has added another great page to Asian history. When this great ideal is implemented among the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, we journalists must unite and use all our strength to promote lofty public opinion and launch an ideological war to defeat Britain and the United States. The purpose of gathering Greater East Asian journalists at this conference is nothing more than to consolidate our determination and further strengthen future coordination and cooperation. Although the conference period is only three days, I hope that all representatives will fully express their enthusiasm and achieve great results, so as not to let down our gathering after the Greater East Asia Conference.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Address by Minister Aoki</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - At the Greater East Asia Press Conference, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia delivered a congratulatory address, the gist of which is as follows: I am extremely pleased to be able to briefly express my thoughts and offer my congratulations at the Greater East Asia Press Conference. Japan's loyal and brave army and navy, in just half a year, have annihilated the enemy's, Britain and the United States', invasive strongholds in East Asia. In the war, we have established a favorable position, and recently, we have gradually defeated the enemy's stubborn counterattacks, expanded the war results, and steadily deployed huge strides in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is worthy of celebration. Because of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a change in the situation in Greater East Asia, Japan wants to use this opportunity to cooperate with neighboring countries, to restore Greater East Asia to its original appearance, and to implement various measures. The alliance treaties recently concluded between our country and the countries of Greater East Asia also take mutual respect for independence and autonomy and close cooperation as their basic spirit. The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo was a major advance in the process of realizing this great ambition. I believe that the Greater East Asia Conference was able to achieve such results in just two days because the Asian people, in resisting centuries of oppression by Britain and the United States, have realized their common mission. Today is the point of divergence for the rise and fall of the whole of Asia, and no longer will it be transformed into a colony of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia must unite and complete this war, advancing in the construction of a new order. The principles clarified in the joint declaration passed by the conference include coexistence and co-prosperity, independent friendship, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world progress. This is the charter for building Greater East Asia. The brilliant achievements of the Greater East Asia Conference and the spirit of morality expressed in the five principles should quickly enable the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand that the Greater East Asia region should form a group, advancing in the construction of Greater East Asia based on this great charter. This is the current urgent task. This kind of moral spirit is not only an indicator of the politics and diplomacy of various countries, but also includes the contact between various ethnic groups, and must be fully expressed in public and private life. You are responsible for guiding public opinion, and you should bear this heavy responsibility. In this important period, representatives of the press from Greater East Asia are gathered together to hold such a large conference, which is of great significance. I believe that this conference will achieve great results. Here, I sincerely pray for the success of the conference.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Chief Councilor of the Propaganda Department, Xu Xiqing, read the congratulatory message on behalf of Minister Lin at the conference, the gist of which is as follows: The Greater East Asia Press Conference is being held in the capital of our allied country, just as the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive stage, and also at a time when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have been signed one after another. Its mission is crucial and great, and its significance is profound and far-reaching. Now, at a time when the countries of Greater East Asia are sincerely united to fight a decisive battle, how to mobilize the total power of the fourth front, to sweep away the poisonous thoughts of Anglo-American aggression and the slave mentality of Eastern traitors who depend on Britain and the United States on the ideological front, to match the development of the Greater East Asia War strategy, and on the other hand, to popularize the fundamental concept of the countries of Greater East Asia living and dying together, jointly defending and attacking, supporting each other, and coexisting and co-prospering, to assist the promotion of the Greater East Asia construction strategy, is an urgent matter. To achieve this goal, the outcome of the Greater East Asia press community is not limited to emotional connection and business observation. The preparation of international institutions and the discussion of technical cooperation are very important. This conference must pay attention to these two aspects and achieve concrete plans. This is one thing that I hope from the public at the conference. Our news undertakings, in the midst of the chaos, are engaged in restoration, and should develop together according to the national conditions of our country, relying on natural materials. In particular, it must meet the needs of the entire Greater East Asia, conform to the trends of the times, and promote together. For all these things, we rely heavily on the assistance of the allied countries. I hope that you will not be stingy in helping us. This is another thing that I hope from the public at the conference.</p>
<h3>Proclaiming the Construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and Inspiring the Hearts of People in All Regions: President Amau Elucidates the Mission of Journalists</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Amau, President of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Press Conference on the 17th, the main points of which are as follows: It is truly gratifying that representatives of the press from various parts of Greater East Asia have gathered together to hold this Greater East Asia Press Conference. East Asian press conferences have been held three times in the past. The first conference coincided with the 2,600th year of the Imperial Era and was held in Tokyo. The second was held in Guangzhou the year before last, and the third was held in Xinjing for the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. Each conference was attended only by representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and it was not possible to gather representatives from all of East Asia, which I have often regretted. However, this conference is attended by many representatives from Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and places such as Syonan, Java, and Sumatra, in addition to China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The holding of this</p>
<p>unprecedented</p>
<p>conference, along with the Greater East Asia Conference held earlier this month, is a symbol of the prosperity of Greater East Asia and is truly cause for celebration. At the same time, I am even more pleased to have this opportunity to briefly express my thoughts to you all. Today, in order to resist the aggression of Britain and the United States, ensure peace in Greater East Asia, and jointly seek the revival of Greater East Asia, we are fighting the enemy. You are also working day and night to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia through newspaper editorials. We hereby express our heartfelt respect to you. Looking back over the past few hundred years, the most powerful weapon used by Britain and the United States to invade East Asia has been strategic propaganda. On the surface, they have used all kinds of clever words and flattering expressions to deceive the people of East Asia, while behind the scenes they have carried out various strategies and deceptions. They have used force to seize India, Ceylon, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and the Philippines. More than a hundred years ago, they extended their evil hand to China. In just two or three hundred years, they have occupied most of East Asia, cleverly implementing various strategies to divide and antagonize the various ethnic groups in East Asia. This so-called "divide and conquer" policy of Britain and the United States has deceived the people of East Asia. Although the communication system of Britain and the United States has collapsed in one corner due to the recent disruption of wireless communications, they have re-formed the World Communications Alliance and are still completely monopolizing the communication rights in East Asia. In recent years, the newspapers of East Asia have hardly been able to freely adopt, select, and cut the news provided by them. Although we are gathered in East Asia, we can hardly look at each other in this regard. Furthermore, this strategic propaganda has sown mutual misunderstandings, leading to mutual isolation. These situations have only occurred in recent years.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, they believed that they could make Japan, which was defending East Asia, submit without using force. On the one hand, they attempted to threaten Japan with economic blockades, and on the other hand, they used strategic propaganda, the so-called encirclement, to impose various threats and pressures on Japan. In addition, they openly established large-scale propaganda agencies in Tokyo, Shanghai, Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok, launching aggressive propaganda offensives. I think these facts are still remembered by everyone. However, Japan, after all, was unwilling to succumb to the aggressors and resolutely rose up against this oppression, resulting in the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. The just and honorable war aims and the construction of Greater East Asia through the cooperation of various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are the most powerful proof of destroying all the enemy's strategic propaganda. In this way, we East Asians have completely driven the forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia in terms of communication and reporting. The facts of East Asia have been reported by the people of East Asia, and the claims of East Asia have been spread to East Asia and to the whole world by the people of East Asia. Even with regard to foreign events, we should be able to publish what we East Asians have seen and collected in newspapers and spread it to the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Our reports and editorials are now not only based on correctness, brightness, and justice, but we are convinced that this correct reporting and editorializing is the new order.</p>
<p>Golden and Stone Power</p>
<p>Today, because of the disastrous defeat in the war, the enemy, despite trying to cover up its anxious atmosphere in its reports and propaganda, is ultimately unable to do so. They have always tried their best to conceal the facts of their defeat from their people, fearing that their people would become uneasy. However, the turmoil and suffering within their own country, no matter how much they try to conceal it, will eventually be revealed to us. In contrast, in our Greater East Asia, the cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo and between Japan and Thailand has become increasingly close. China and Japan have also concluded a new alliance treaty. Furthermore, Burma and the Philippines have achieved independence, and Indonesia has also gained the right to participate in government. Even the Provisional Government of Free India has finally been born. On the 5th of this month, the Greater East Asia Conference was held, and the Greater East Asia Declaration was solemnly announced to the world. The main purpose of this declaration is to promote mutual cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia, to defend against the aggression of Britain and the United States, to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, and to contribute to the establishment of world peace. Therefore, the five principles of the Greater East Asia Construction Program were formulated and announced to China and foreign countries. This Greater East Asia Declaration is truly a great text, unprecedented in history, that proclaims the common ideals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The content is devoid of the empty words of the enemy Britain and the United States, and is purely based on the reality of Greater East Asia. Moreover, we believe that this Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Construction Program,</p>
<p>which is based on morality, is the supreme goal of all mankind. Therefore, this Greater East Asia Declaration is the foundation for completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. Today, the press circles of Greater East Asia are united as one. Not only should we do our best to publicize the ideals of building Greater East Asia as shown in the Greater East Asia Declaration Program at home and abroad, but we should also inspire the hearts of people in all regions in order to achieve this ideal. This is also the most glorious mission of Greater East Asian journalists. I hereby express my respect for your efforts and pray for your continued courageous progress in the future.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsumura's Speech: Striving for Victory</h3>
<p>A Blood Oath Amidst the Sound of Cannons</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Hidemura Matsumura of the Japanese Army Information Department delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Press Conference, the main points of which are as follows: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" As you all know, this is a saying of Confucius, the most holy sage of China, 2,500 years ago. Now, standing on this podium, witnessing you all from various parts of Greater East Asia gathering together in a very amiable atmosphere, I cannot help but feel deeply "is it not delightful?" We have always met, but the amiability of our relationship is like that of close friends. However, this kind of friendship has not been able to be expressed in social places during peacetime, nor is it easy to express it at banquets, but it is fully expressed during the Great East Asia War, which is raging with the sound of cannons. This is truly a blood oath in the iron-blooded camp, and it is also the friendship of comrades-in-arms formed in the just war to liberate Greater East Asia. Why, then, in the past, were we unable to support each other and move forward on the road to common prosperity? This is nothing more than that the aggressors of Asia, Britain and the United States, hindered our mutual support by means of oppression. Britain began to invade India 300 years ago, and the Netherlands also invaded Java and Celebes, followed by China. The tragedy of Asia really began here. Since the discovery of gold mines in California 100 years ago, the United States has focused its attention on the Pacific Ocean, trying its best to divide Asia, which has become a market for various European countries. It deliberately launched wars, using cruel means to make the people of the island nations its sacrifices, and seized Europe from Spain, as a base for exploiting East Asia. Britain and the United States, with inhuman actions and wars, raised the flags of Britain and the United States in various parts of Asia. We Asians are all eager to have a day when we can remove the flags of the aggressors by the hands of us Asians and replace them with the flags of Asian countries.</p>
<p>Asia is No Longer Weak</p>
<p>Britain and the United States, out of jealousy of Japan's prosperity, have suppressed Japan in every possible way, and have instigated Yu Jiang to engage in anti-Japanese and insulting Japan, which led to the Sino-Japanese Incident. After the outbreak of the European War, they intensified their efforts, abolishing trade treaties with Japan and freezing funds, even imposing economic pressure no different from war. The more Japan endured and respected itself, the more they intensified their efforts, and they also wanted to reduce Asia to the status of a colony. Therefore, Japan was forced to resolutely rise up for the sake of self-defense, in order to drive the aggressors out of East Asia. This was truly unexpected by Britain and the United States. Because they still hold on to the delusions of the past, believing that Asia is still as weak as it used to be. But today, Asia is not the Asia of the past, and Japan is not the Japan of the past. Today's Japan has the strength and determination to build a new order in East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, in just half a year, the aggressors have been driven out of East Asia, and various Asian countries have either directly participated in the war or cooperated in the war. Today, those who ideally support each other have supported each other, and those who ideally help each other have helped each other, forming a united front. For the sake of defending East Asia, they have courageously shouldered the task of defeating the counterattack of the aggressors. If we fail in this war, Asia will be difficult to liberate. If Asia is not liberated, it will not have the glory of autonomy and independence. At that time, Asia will forever be reduced to the slaves of the aggressors. Therefore, we should eliminate all difficulties and do our best to strive for final victory. The Greater East Asia Common Declaration passed by the Greater East Asia Conference, and the five principles in the Outline of Construction of Greater East Asia, namely, co-existence and co-prosperity, independent affinity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to the progress of the world, have formed a new order in the new world. We are now united as one, fighting for the rise and fall of the entire nation of Greater East Asia. In the future, we should work even harder to strive for final victory.</p>
<p>The Conference Has Profound Meaning</p>
<p>However, what strengthens the solidarity of the one billion people of Asia and strengthens the close relationship between each other is actually your pens. The mission you bear under the decisive battle is extremely important. I believe that in this sense, today's Greater East Asia Press Conference has a very profound meaning in terms of combat. These five principles in the Outline of Construction of Greater East Asia are not like the slogans used by Britain and the United States for deception. We are now implementing them, and we also have actions that practice justice. The eyes of newspaper reporters are extremely sharp. There is a saying that "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." I heard that after the closing of the conference, you will temporarily stay in Japan to visit. I hope you will use your sharp eyes to observe widely. Moreover, you are scheduled to visit the Army Officer School, the Flying School, and the Aircraft Factory. I think at that time, you will definitely be able to learn why the Japanese army is so strong. Also, why are the Japanese army's aircraft so strong? I think when you visit the factory, you will definitely be able to see in person the rapid increase in the production of Japanese aircraft. I hope you will pay attention to the training of the spirit, so that you will know that Japan's martial arts are the martial arts of God, and Japan's strength is the strength of justice that eliminates evil and manifests righteousness. I hope to borrow your pens to make the belief of the 100 million people of Japan that "justice will surely prevail" the belief of the 1 billion people of Asia. I hope that the pens of Asia and the strength of justice will always be together to unite all the forces of Asia to defeat the arch-enemies Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Tashiro's Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency telegram) - Lieutenant Colonel Tashiro of the Japanese General Headquarters Naval Information Department delivered a speech at the press conference on behalf of the Naval Information Minister, the main points of which are as follows: It goes without saying that the war situation in Europe and Asia is becoming increasingly fierce. It is necessary to carry out fierce armed warfare in parallel, and the ideological warfare between the enemy and us and the strategic warfare on both sides are also very active. At this time, representatives of news and communication agencies from various countries and regions of Greater East Asia have gathered in Tokyo and are holding the "Greater East Asia Press Conference" here today, which has profound significance and extremely important missions. We sincerely hope that all representatives can exchange opinions frankly, encourage each other, and move towards a common goal, smashing the enemy's strategies externally, and making the one billion people of Greater East Asia unite more closely internally and exert great comprehensive power. Regarding this point, we have great expectations for this conference. The tasks undertaken by news and communication reports differ between peacetime and wartime, and there are many difficulties in exerting its functions in wartime that cannot be imagined in peacetime. However, on the other hand, we believe that today is the most valuable time to engage in this kind of work. We hope that every word written by all of you news and communication reporters is full of historical spirit, and that every day's newspaper becomes a source for transforming the world.</p>
<p>Smashing the Enemy's Strategies</p>
<p>How should we smash the enemy's strategies, and what attitude should we take towards the enemy's strategies? I will briefly state my views on these two points as follows: First, we must consolidate internal unity, fully utilize our brains in all aspects, strive to uplift the will of the people of each country, and at the same time strengthen the cooperation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. We must not forget the great common war goals and should make them clearer and clearer. The five major principles of the Greater East Asia Common Declaration are the just war goals of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. News and communication agencies must thoroughly disseminate this purpose throughout the entire Greater East Asia, use it to enlighten the people, and build a solid fortress to defend against the enemy's strategies. I believe that we must jointly strive to realize these five major principles based on morality. However, the most important point to note here is that the realization of the five major principles, "that is, the construction of Greater East Asia," is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the preamble of the Greater East Asia Common Declaration stipulates that the countries of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other to complete the Greater East Asia War. In any case, victory in the war is the first condition. In the end, all goals must be concentrated on this. Ideological warfare and armed warfare are one and two, and two and one. You are the fighters of thought, so it is hoped that you will pay attention to this point, strive to guide public opinion and daily news, and make everything war-capable. Furthermore, we must make every effort to fully militarize the human elements and material resources of Greater East Asia. The greatest task of the current speech and reporting agencies must also be to move forward along this path.</p>
<p>Firm Belief in Victory</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to tell you that we hold a firm belief that "we will win the war absolutely." The more fierce the enemy's counterattack, the more great results we can achieve when our country's strength is greater when the scale of the enemy's counterattack is greater. However, no matter how much the country boasts of its productivity, it will collapse every time it counterattacks because our army has achieved great results. Soon there will be a major turning point in the war. The enemy will only have to submit to the loyal and brave spirit of our soldiers. We believe that the day of victory in the Greater East Asia War will coincide with the day of the realization of the new order in Greater East Asia. It is hoped that you will firmly believe in this certainty of victory and, after returning home, will separately express the people's determination to complete the war.</p>
<h3>Germany Must Seize the Opportunity to Maintain Glorious Victory: Goebbels Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress in northern Berlin on Monday evening, stating that Germany's survival and its position in the world are the themes of this war. He also expressed his belief in Germany's final victory. Goebbels' attendance at the meeting was sudden because it was not expected beforehand. He discussed the war issue for two hours. He said that if the German people are determined to seize every opportunity, then we will definitely win. However, the question is how to boost our spirit until we dare to put down our weapons again after the outcome of the victory or defeat is determined. The glorious victories won by the German army in the past four years have laid the foundation for final victory. The current task is to find a way to protect it. Goebbels then recounted the history of the National Socialist Party's struggle for power, saying that obtaining power was more difficult than Germany's work in maintaining its position in the war, but we achieved final victory with perseverance, loyalty, and unwavering belief. Therefore, the result of this war will also be our victory over the deliverymen.</p>
<h3>Go to Delhi! The Roar of the Indian National Army</h3>
<p>— ImaI Masatake</p>
<p>A New National Flag</p>
<p>Delhi is shuddering.</p>
<p>The British flag fluttering over the Governor-General's mansion in Delhi is now shivering in the terrifying wind.</p>
<p>That flag was once trampled under the boots of the Japanese army in Hong Kong. It was the flag that fell with the white flag raised in Singapore and the setting sun on Bukit Timah Hill. Now, it is the old empire that has been repeatedly defeated, using all its strength to desperately raise the flag in its last remaining treasure trove. And the 400 million people of India are now rebelling and cursing against this flag, shouting with a bloody smell.</p>
<p>Now there is a new flag, mightily launching a counter-offensive against the British flag that is screaming in this bloody whirlwind. Saffron, white, and green. The saffron above symbolizes courage and sacrifice, the white in the middle symbolizes purity and harmony, and the green below symbolizes truth and the spirit of the warrior. On that flag is painted a "spinning wheel", representing the glory of a free India, an independent India, and its people. Four hundred million people are bleeding under this flag, vowing to take back the independence of their motherland from the hands of Britain. Indeed, this flag is a flag of the nation born from the bloody rain of world turmoil. It is the Indian National Army that raises this flag.</p>
<p>On October 24, Showa 18, the Provisional Government of Free India on Syonan Island solemnly declared war on Britain and the United States under this glorious Indian independence flag. The order to begin the offensive has been given. For their beloved motherland, for the freedom and independence of their motherland, the Indian National Army has risen up and is advancing towards the capital of their motherland, "the long-standing red fortress". "Advance to Delhi!" "Attack Delhi!"</p>

It entered Yunnan in the southwest of China, dealing a devastating blow to the Yu army that was strengthening southwards, and blocking the strategic road between Chongqing and British India. Before the rainy season passed, it had already achieved a pre-emptive major victory. For half a year, the dense mildew and rain that covered the border between Burma and India have now turned into a beautiful and clear sky. The rivers and mountains of the motherland, welcoming the Indian National Army, shone with the scorching sun, opening up the road for their offensive. This spring, the stage for the Aragon tragedy was unfolded in the area of the Mentao River, and now it has once again become the focus of world attention. The rainy season has passed, and the southern sun is illuminating the stage, and the lead actors who will sing the triumphal song on this stage have shown their majestic and beautiful full appearance, standing at the stage entrance.</p>
<p>National Heroes Rise in Time</p>
<p>Since hearing the name of Jiangtela Bose this summer, "now in Tokyo", Delhi has begun to tremble. The exploiters in Delhi saw that under their feet, with Bose's name as the center, the 400 million people of India were uniting and arming themselves. Terror, trembling, this is not a nightmare, nor is it a phantom, but a fact that is rapidly becoming a reality. The two million Indians living in East Asia gathered with cheers to the place designated by Bose. In Hong Kong, in Guangzhou, in Saigon, in Syonan, the Indian National Army was formed one after another. The youths, with joy overflowing from their faces, joined together one after another, vowing to shed blood for their motherland. Bose arrived in Syonan from Tokyo on July 2. Before the guard of honor of the Indian National Army that greeted him, his majestic body appeared. In the eyes of the passionate young revolutionary, tears of emotion and gratitude flowed, shouting: "—The only thing our independent struggle lacks is the armed force used to fight against Britain. Now you have become patriotic fighters and given us armed force." And he shook hands with the soldiers who were all shedding tears. The generation of people who can save India finally saw their own army, which had been awaited for a long time, celebrating the acquisition of talent and rising up, admiring it as their commander. Following the five crystals, Commander Bose declared on the parade platform of the tens of thousands of mechanized troops of the Indian National Army: "Isn't the army that can liberate India in Syonan, which used to be the base of Britain?

This battle government has been recognized by the governments of Japan and the various Axis powers, and on October 24, it declared war on Britain and the United States. The bugle of the offensive is sounding, and the saffron, white, and green independence flag stands tall in the new East Asian situation.</p>
<p>The Climax of the Great National Drama</p>
<p>Following the second act of the "Aragon Tragedy" that is about to be staged soon, this great national drama is preparing to describe the third act of this moving climax. That is the collapse of the huge British Indian Army, said to number 3.5 million, and the merger of the Indian army with the National Army. The Indian troops first used in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 numbered 67,000 in 1796. In the First World War, there were two divisions each of infantry and cavalry on the French front, and four brigades of field artillery. Including those sent to Africa and the Balkans, there were a total of 550,000 combatants, and a total of 390,000 combatants. It is precisely Britain's treasure trove.</p>
<p>In this Great East Asia War, the current British Indian Army can be divided into five types: border defense forces, domestic security forces, coastal defense forces, overseas dispatch forces, and reserve forces. In addition, there are also light tanks, 32,000 armored cars, a motorized armored cavalry, and a mechanized field artillery team. The Air Force has Lysander reconnaissance teams and Valen bombing teams. Pelham bombing war. The five-year plan planned by Chet Ertert in 1938 was quickly realized due to the outbreak of the war, and it is said that it is close to the goal of 3.5 million people. This large army was used to divide Bengal in 1905, the Amritsar massacre in 1919, and the non-cooperation movement in 1921, and the anti-British atmosphere is rising day by day. The time for the collapse is imminent. Following the Beghawar rebellion in 1934, the rebellion of the Iparaisstein dispatch army in this war, in the whirlwind of this great collapse, we welcome the attack of this Indian army. This is indeed the largest battle in modern times, and it is the great national drama of the 400 million people of India that will unfold in the present world. And that curtain has already been raised. (Sho: From the November 7th issue of Asahi Weekly)</p>
<h3>Gomel is repelled by the German army. Soviet pincer offensive. Major battle in western Kiev is underway.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: Fierce fighting continues in the central Dnepr River west of the river in the past twenty-four hours. Near Zhitomir, Soviet troops are still trying to expand the wedge-shaped area, and the battle situation remains unchanged. The German army continues to attack the southern flank of the Soviet army and occupied several Soviet positions southeast of Zhitomir the day before. The Soviet army is increasing pressure on Korosten, but with little progress. The fighting in the triangle of Korosten-Zhitomir-Fastov remains fierce. The situation is also intense in the Dnepr River bend. North of Krivoy Rog, the Soviet army is attempting to break through the German positions with elite troops. The German army is not only defending but also counterattacking several times. Currently, the forces are evenly matched. The situation remains unchanged near Crimea and the Kerch Peninsula in the lower reaches of the Dnepr River. On the Gomel front, the Soviet army continued its offensive the day before, obviously intending to attack the city with a pincer strategy from the north and south. The German artillery units east of Zhlobin are helping to stop the Soviet advance, and the battle situation is also unchanged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: On the Gomel front, the Soviet army has not yet achieved its strategic goals. The enemy is attempting to cut off the transportation line between Gomel and Rechitsa, but this has not been achieved despite fierce fighting. All attacks by the Red Army north of Gomel have been repelled.</p>
<h3>The German army adopts disengagement tactics in preparation for a major decisive battle next year.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (German News Agency dispatch) - Regarding the continued retreat of the German army at various points on the Eastern Front, avoiding a decisive battle with the Soviet army, and gradually abandoning territory when the Soviet army launches intensive attacks, this action is in accordance with a specific objective of the German army. As a result, the Soviet army failed to reach its goals in the summer offensive, and the same was true for the autumn offensive. Now entering the stage of winter warfare, the enemy has still not been able to trap the German army in a war of annihilation, as in the German army's major battles of 1941-42. The battles in the Kiev and Zhitomir regions adequately prove this view. In the past four months of the Soviet pincer movement, the German army initially resisted with all its strength, then weakened its strength, and finally disengaged from the enemy and advanced to new positions. Therefore, the Soviet army has not been able to complete any operations this year. However, the German side is still maintaining silence and not discussing the locations where the German reserve forces are being used on the Eastern Front, although it is now certain that it has sufficient reserve forces available for deployment. While the important factors and possible crises on other European battlefields are not being publicized, it remains to be seen where and when this highly developed European military industry will begin to exert its power. This is a retreat based on its broad plan. The German army is preparing to use the full force of its entire military apparatus in 1944 to launch a concentrated military strike against the enemy in a decisive battle. Viewed from this perspective, the enemy's so-called initiative, without realizing it, is in line with the German plan.</p>

<h3>Li Gongduo visits Shanghai to inspect various schools</h3>

<h3>Significant progress in Sino-Japanese-Manchu trade, various tariff revenues are also gradually increasing</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of overseas transportation obstruction, the city’s various trades have long been suspended. However, the trade between China, Japan, and Manchuria has obviously made considerable progress, according to the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs yesterday. After the financial authorities found ways to thoroughly transfer the customs from various places, all tax revenues have been increasing day by day. The import, export, and transit tax revenues of the customs in recent months seem to have doubled compared to the past. The tariff agencies in Nanjing and South China are also gradually restoring their old appearances, and the results of tax revenue promotion are becoming better and better. If the Nanyang trade is restored one day, the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the Nanyang territories will inevitably become smoother. At that time, customs tax revenue will increase sharply.

The tax police are very strict about the inspection work. All merchants and goods that cannot produce a permit and customs declaration will be detained and submitted to the customs for verification. If it does not exceed the specified amount, it will be allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>The Director of the Matsushima Press broadcasted last night "The rapid turn of the Pacific war situation"</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News The air battles between Japan and the United States in the South Pacific are becoming more and more fierce. The Japanese air force has launched fierce battles against the enemy for days, inflicting heavy damage and brilliant victories. The Japanese Headquarters has successively issued consecutive announcements. Colonel Keizo Matsushima, Director of the Press of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, gave a special speech at 7:20 p.m. on the 16th at the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Station, explaining the significance of the first to fourth air battles in the Battle of Bougainville, exposing the enemy's ugly and embarrassing appearance in consecutive battles, entitled "The rapid turn of the Pacific war situation," which lasted twenty minutes. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The war is unfolding fiercely</p>
<p>The resistance of Britain and the United States has always been concentrated in the Solomon Islands in the past year and a half, especially in recent months, the enemy has gradually approached our strategic circle with the air force and surface ships cooperating in combat. The progress of the war can be clearly understood through our fair reports. The elite troops of our navy finally promoted the brilliant victory of a thunderbolt and swept away the dark clouds over the Pacific Ocean in a corner of Bougainville Island at this time. This is the battle result of the Battle of Bougainville Island and the first to fourth air battles on the sea off Bougainville Island since the air raid in the Muna Island area on October 27. The war is still unfolding fiercely.</p>
<p>The US headquarters is at a loss</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems too early to calculate the battle results in that area, but how significant the Japanese victory is during this period can be seen from the fact that the US headquarters is at a loss, hurriedly convening a headquarters meeting, and announcing the reorganization of the Pacific Fleet on the 14th, using the largest tactics in history. During this period, the enemy the United States suffered painful damage, so it is necessary to renew the Pacific war stack. This proves that the damage suffered by the US Navy is the first in its history. Since the start of the air battle near Muna Island, more than 70 enemy US ships have been attacked, sunk, or destroyed, and more than 530 aircraft have been shot down or destroyed. Most of the main forces gathered in that area may have been destroyed or reduced, and the damage to the communist soldiers is also over 20,000. US Secretary of the Navy Knox, on November 10, claimed that Japan's claims were not true. If the facts were like this, there would be no need to reorganize the Pacific Fleet. The US Navy generals and soldiers have suffered unprecedented sacrifices in history, and their brave fighting has been wiped out by Knox. The United States is greatly angry at the release of the facts by its naval authorities. The ends of shaking have been revealed at present, and the truth will soon be revealed. In early November,</p>
<p>The war situation is of great importance, so we must move forward</p>
<p>Before the Bougainville Island attack battle had begun, it was said that it had given Japan a major blow, but when meeting with reporters on the 3rd, it suddenly admitted that the Japanese army had the advantage of being able to quickly replenish aircraft in the South Pacific, and also claimed that the Japanese army did not need a large air force on other fronts, so it was able to concentrate all its forces on the South Pacific, etc. The United Kingdom is also afraid of the Japanese military's victory this time, and claims that the United States' assessment of the Japanese air force is completely underestimated, admitting that US flight tactics have undergone a major decline. Roosevelt once said. The landing operation on Bougainville Island was originally unwilling to use flight tactics by the British and American combined forces, but in order to occupy and attack the Rabaul base, they had no choice but to fight one battle. From this, we can infer the urgency of the enemy's attempt to recapture Rabaul. The importance of the war situation in that area can also be imagined. We must all unite and strive forward to completely reduce the British and Americans, and we will not stop until we achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>The two phases of household flour in western Shanghai are expected to be purchased quickly</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Western Shanghai District Public Liaison Office will start the payment procedures for the 21st phase of household flour in the Western Shanghai District in the shortest possible time.

It is now being actively prepared and will be established in the near future.</p>
<h3>Slogans for the Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>(2) Those related to the "clothing" aspect</p>
<p>"Only valuing clothes and not electricity" is the thought of snobbish villains.</p>
<p>Wearing old clothes should be respected.</p>
<p>Gaudi and gorgeous clothing is despised by everyone.</p>
<p>Even a thread of Chinese silk always reminds us that material resources are misused.</p>
<h3>The Baocjia is formulated to guide the anti-air raid, (1)</h3>
<p>Order all relevant parties to strictly abide by it</p>
<p>The Baocjia has recently printed and finalized "Anti-Air Raid Guidance Key Point No. 9," which is posted for reference. Its content states: "Among the cases discussed at this anti-air raid liaison meeting, the following items are particularly important in order to cope with the current situation in time and seek rapid implementation and preparation. It is hoped that the relevant parties will be ordered to strictly comply with it, and do not be negligent.</p>
<p>Shelters</p>
<p>The details are as follows: 1. Anti-air raid shelters, the designation of public shelters. Previously, each sub-bureau was designated as a building for shelters based on the report of the B-type No. 2 Medical Anti-Epidemic Institute. The Public Works Department of the First District Public Office should be responsible for verifying and approving it before it can be officially designated. A flag with the following figure should be hung on the building designated as a shelter for weaving identification, and a green electric light should be lit at night. The upper part should be added with crowd to cover it, so as not to leak light to the sky. However, if an unexpected accident occurs before it is approved by the Public Works Department, the previously established public shelter will be used as usual. (Figure omitted) The establishment of public anti-air raid is based on the first item. The establishment of family shelters should select a relatively safe location within the Yan to establish this shelter. Once a warning alarm is received. Bedding, blankets, mats, etc. should be quickly surrounded around to prevent danger, and all furniture and supplies that are easy to fall or be destroyed should be moved to another room for safekeeping in advance. If you want to construct this air raid trench in the garden or open space outside the building, you must first obtain the guidance and approval of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Window stickers</p>
<p>2. Promote the matter of sticking shatterproof paper strips to glass windows. Although all parties have followed the instructions, some have not yet implemented it. It should be strictly urged to be implemented, and it must not be played around with or delayed. As for the method of sticking paper strips, it should be practical and effective, that is, paper strips of four centimeters wide should be pasted every ten centimeters to form a square shape. The two ends of the paper strips should be tightly dotted on the window frame, but if it has been pasted and does not meet the above-mentioned regulations, it will be convenient to paste it again, and it must not be forced.</p>
<p>3. Matters to be prepared when the water supply is stopped. After the alert alarm is issued, the possibility of stopping the water supply due to air raids should be prevented. Therefore, after receiving the alert alarm, drinking water should be prepared as much as possible immediately. In order to prepare sufficient drinking water, a preliminary investigation should be conducted within the area under its jurisdiction to see if there are any wells that can be used for drinking.</p>
<p>Identification markings</p>
<p>4. Matters to be carried with identification markings. In order to facilitate identification after an unexpected accident occurs, after the alert alarm is issued, all people in the city should carry cloth-made markings with them for identification. The markings should specify in detail the names and addresses of each person, and in order to avoid loss due to spiritual movement causing clothing damage, etc., they should be sewn firmly into the real or waist belt, etc., which are relatively stable.</p>
<p>Traffic control</p>
<p>5. Traffic control matters after the alarm is issued. It has been found that after the alarm is issued, ropes are often stretched at various intersections to prohibit traffic. If an air raid occurs, this behavior may increase the possibility of damage. Therefore, it should be avoided as much as possible in the future, but it is not limited to the management of traffic by stretching ropes along the sidewalk. As for the need for martial law due to security incidents, the previous example will still be followed.</p>
<p>Telephone application</p>
<p>6. All unimportant telephones should be stopped after the alarm occurs. Within half an hour of the alert alarm being issued, all unimportant telephones other than those related to the alarm should be stopped from being used. Also, during the time when the air raid alarm is issued, all unimportant telephones other than those related to the alarm must not be used.</p>
<p>Evacuation method</p>
<p>7. Precautions for evacuation. In order to reduce the damage during the attack, the method of decentralized evacuation should be adopted. If evacuees find that the area near them is being bombed, they should go to that area to engage in firefighting and other active work. They should not adopt passive methods such as large-scale shelters with complete construction equipment for the purpose of protecting public safety, etc., but the elderly, children, and those suffering from old age should be guided to nearby safe shelters for evacuation in advance.</p>
<h3>City Propaganda Office Held Third Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Various Political Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: The City Propaganda Office held its third regular press conference yesterday (the 17th) at 2:00 PM in the City Hall's second-floor conference room. Reporters from various newspapers and representatives from various government agencies attended. The conference began with an opening speech by Director Liang of the Propaganda Office, followed by representatives from various agencies answering questions raised by the newspaper reporters. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Exemption from Self-Defense Corps Service</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* asked: What are the regulations regarding exemption from service in the Baojia Self-Defense Corps? What are the legal procedures for applying for exemption? The City Baojia Committee replied: According to Article 8 of the Regulations for Self-Defense Corps Members, public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, school teachers, students, doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, and those with disabilities or special circumstances may be exempted from service upon certification or verification by their respective agencies. Therefore, anyone who meets the above criteria is exempt from serving in the Self-Defense Corps. Subsequently, to prevent abuses such as residents falsely claiming exemption, it was decided through consultation that the Corps would issue exemption certificates for verification. Regarding the exemption procedures, the Corps will print application forms and distribute them to the squad leaders (i.e., Lianbao chiefs) for distribution. Residents under their jurisdiction who meet the exemption criteria should complete the forms according to the instructions, have them stamped and certified by their respective supervisors and Baojia chiefs, and submit them to the Corps along with supporting documents and three photographs. After verification, the Corps will issue an exemption certificate as proof and notify the respective squad leaders. The printing cost for the application form, notification, and exemption certificate is 60 cents per set. It is hoped that all levels of public officials will apply in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Eighth District Ration Cards</p>
<p>The *Chunghua Daily* asked: When residents of the eighth district of this city move within the district, their household registration at the new address is reported. After two weeks, when it is time to issue commodity ration cards, they are unable to receive them. Does the Eighth District Baojia Office have any regulations regarding the time limit for obtaining ration cards after a household moves? Can they apply for a replacement? The Eighth District Baojia Office replied: The Baojia Office distributes commodity ration cards based on household registration records provided by the Food Ration Office. Those not registered will not be able to receive them. The date of distribution is difficult to determine due to the source of food and the processing procedures. Furthermore, due to the fixed quantity, it is difficult to issue replacements.</p>
<p>Household Registration Movement in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: After reporting household registration changes in western Shanghai, it often takes two months to receive rice and flour purchase certificates. This easily leads to misunderstandings between residents and the handling personnel (such as Bao chiefs). Can a suitable time limit be stipulated so that everyone knows what to expect? The Food Bureau replied: Generally, applications for rice and flour, except in special circumstances, are reported to the bureau one month and distributed the following month. Therefore, residents should be able to receive rice and flour purchase certificates one and a half months after reporting their household registration. If residents still have not received them or have any questions, they can inquire with the Food Bureau. The Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct replied: The handover procedures for the Fourth Baojia in western Shanghai were completed last week and merged into the Baojia Office of the First Police Precinct. In the future, regarding residents' movement declarations, the Western District Office has been ordered to instruct all Bao chiefs to process them as quickly as possible. Regarding rice and flour purchase certificates, we will investigate the reasons with the food authorities to eliminate abuses and maintain integrity.</p>
<p>Inspection by Police at the North Station</p>
<p>The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The police stationed at the North Railway Station, recently dispatched by the First Police Precinct, have been conducting inspections more strictly than before. Passengers are often subjected to excessive harassment, and public officials must also queue up. Moreover, there are often gangs who collude to reserve places in the station and solicit passengers for payment. Citizens have expressed their dissatisfaction and believe that this phenomenon should not exist after the recovery of the concessions. Does the police authority intend to improve this situation? The First Police Precinct replied: Regarding the special passage for public officials, this bureau has submitted a request to the city government to approve a unified method of identification. Regarding the suppression of gangsters, this bureau has ordered the responsible branch to strictly suppress them. Regarding the special passage for Central News Agency liaison officers, it is feared that misunderstandings may arise with other parties, so please consult with the responsible branch (the Fourth Red Mouth Branch) to provide special convenience.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: There are bunkers at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Nanking Road and the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Nanking Road in the jurisdiction of the First District Public Office. They seem to have been set up during the war, but they have not been removed. Moreover, the police department has dispatched Russian detectives and many police officers who are stationed there all the time. They often harass pedestrians carrying daily necessities, regardless of whether they are controlled goods. Has the police authority heard of this situation? Can they conduct a secret investigation and strictly suppress it to eliminate this trend? The First Police Precinct replied: The barbed wire on Avenue Edward VII and Bubbling Well Road cannot be removed from a security point of view at present. The responsible persons will be strictly held accountable for illegal acts by the police. If such facts occur, please notify this bureau. Furthermore, the reorganization of the security lines after the merger of western Shanghai and the former Third Bureau is currently being planned.</p>
<p>Changing Street Name Signs</p>
<p>The *Chunghua Daily* asked: The city government has revised the names of the streets in this city, but due to long-standing use, old habits are difficult to change, and the old street name signs have not been replaced in various places. Does the authorities have any thorough measures to implement this? The Public Works Bureau replied: The Public Works Bureau has consulted with the First and Eighth District Public Offices and decided to start construction on new street signs on December 1st. The new street name will be clearly marked on the front, and the old name will still be attached on the back. By the end of March next year, the old name on the back will be removed.</p>
<p>More Than 400 Tons of Cooking Oil Used as Household Oil</p>
<p>According to news from the cooking oil allocation sector, the household oil distribution in this city has been suspended for a long time due to the transfer of military allocation management. It is said that the relevant authorities, considering the urgent needs of the citizens, could not delay any longer. Recently, they have borrowed more than 400 tons of cooking oil from the former military allocation group to be used as household oil. Therefore, once the price issue is resolved, sales can begin. Furthermore, according to a Mr. from the Daode Oil Factory, the free circulation of cooking oil has been quite smooth recently, especially in recent days, as various production areas fear that the unified transport to Shanghai will increase further, so the supply is particularly abundant.</p>

<h3>286 Factories Punished for Not Obtaining Licenses</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reports: According to a certain member of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the First District Public Office, as of the 15th of last month, 286 factories were found to have delayed obtaining licenses and were fined a total of 12,408 yuan.

Starting this week, factories that delay obtaining licenses will be fined 100 yuan, and after next week, it will increase to 120 yuan. According to the reveal, there are 4,000 factories registered in the Industrial and Social Affairs Office, half of which have already obtained licenses.

<h3>New Language on Venereal Disease</h3>
<p>Eradicating the Root Cause of White Turbidity</p>
<p>For both new and old cases of white turbidity, the complete eradication of the root cause is the only way to be considered a cure, and only then can the doctor's responsibility to the patient be considered complete. However, for such white turbidity, it is advisable to first diagnose the root cause clearly, and then use scientific methods to treat it, completely eliminating all white turbidity and clarifying any remaining toxins, so as not to have the misfortune of a rekindled fire. Furthermore, quick surgery should be used to correct the disease state, so that not only is the root cause eradicated, but normal function is restored.</p>
<p>Inguinal Bubo Without Surgery, Soft Chancre Drops</p>
<p>Not cutting for inguinal buboes is my practical experience for many years. For all inguinal buboes that are early and have not yet suppurated, I never use the method of surgery, which causes patients to suffer, but use the method of eliminating scrofula. Painless treatment of soft chancre is most notable, because this disease is extremely prone to ulceration, leading to the destruction of the penis, but using the Miao seedling therapy can heal early and preserve completeness.

<p>The All-Shanghai Youth Basketball Tournament, organized by the China Youth Christian Fellowship, opened its first act of the finals at the Baxianqiao China Youth Gymnasium last night at 7:30 PM. The audience was crowded, but because all seats were reserved, the order was good. First, Longhua played against Baiyan. The two sides were evenly matched, making it difficult to separate them. Longhua finally defeated Baiyan with a score of 17 to 16, winning by one precious point. Next, an exhibition match took place, with Dahua facing Chengyou. The two teams were also evenly matched. At the end of the first half, Chengyou was slightly better at seven to six. After the change of ends, the competition was still fierce, forming a seesaw situation. In the end, Dahua reversed the defeat with a score of 21 to 15. The second act of the game will continue at the original location tonight starting at 7:30 PM. The first game will be the finals between Qingyan and Baiyan.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Under New Circumstances</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, local development, and Japanese businessmen have encountered many changes in the past few years, either devoting themselves to assisting in combat or engaging in the restoration of public order, showing an active attitude. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, trade with third countries was cut off. Driven by the situation, the direction of operations was changed, and the scope of business was reduced. With the implementation of the new policy towards China and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has ushered in a period of turning points. From theoretical to practical, it has already declared a clear trend.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Commercial Control Committee can be said to be the result of the implementation of the new policy. Under various new circumstances, the purchase of important local products such as rice, miscellaneous grains, and cotton all embodies the spirit of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Many joint ventures have achieved satisfactory results, which is also a manifestation of this spirit. Only mutual understanding is the principle of economic cooperation and the basis for advancing work.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the guiding position, after the reduction of the concessions, Sino-Japanese personnel exchanges became more frequent. It is essential to deeply understand economic knowledge research, financial policy establishment, and the application of control work. The key to understanding is the fluent language, which is urgently needed. This is something that cannot be ignored at present.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will have satisfactory results. At present, the acquisition of local economic knowledge and experience, and the honing of various professional skills are all current priorities. How to promote understanding, communicate language, so that work can be to the point and smoothly promoted, is what everyone should work together to achieve. (Excerpt from the China Information of November 15)</p>
<h3>Various Industries Will Seek Thorough Assistance in Procuring Materials</h3>
<p>The various industry trade associations in this city, in order to adapt to the environment, seek the welfare of the industry, and regulate the wartime economy, have all separately set up "material distribution groups." According to an investigation by a Shanghai News reporter, various industries have difficulties in procurement work, so that materials from various places cannot be transported and distributed in an orderly manner. However, in order to uphold the original intention and achieve effective results, they will separately submit requests to the competent authorities, requesting thorough assistance. It is reported that the requested items include: issuing orders to police officers not to obstruct them, providing a large number of ships, and facilitating procurement.</p>
<p>Evaluation and Distribution</p>
<p>As for the distribution materials of various industries, the group will evaluate the standard price in advance. A list will be submitted to the relevant authorities for review, stating the original cost, cargo name, place of production, use, and price. After approval, the members of the industry will be notified to pay the shipment fee within a time limit. However, the distribution method will be divided into A, B, C, and D levels. If the capital amount is the highest among the industry, it will be classified as A level, and the lowest capital amount will be classified as D level, and the appropriate capital amount will be classified as B and C levels.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibited from Reselling</p>
<p>Once the trade companies of the same industry obtain this batch of goods, if they are shippers, they must approve them to the companies that operate these goods within the time limit. If they are retailers, they must be listed in a prominent place for customers to choose from. However, it is absolutely forbidden to resell them for profit, or hoard or exceed the price limit. If one of the above-mentioned circumstances occurs and is found to be true, the right to enjoy distribution will be suspended, and the membership will be revoked at the same time, so as to alert others and stabilize the business market.</p>
<h3>Material Transfer Must Be Certified by the Trade Association</h3>
<p>Apply to the Permission Office Again</p>
<p>The trade associations in this city believe that under the current wartime state, the control of materials should be meticulous. In order to prevent industry members from smuggling materials out of the country, it is stipulated that no matter whether they are wholesalers or retailers, the transfer of materials must first be certified by the association. After the association approves it, it will issue a "transfer certificate." With this certificate, they can apply to the material transfer office of the Commercial Control Committee. When members apply to the association for a certificate, the following items must be clearly stated: Company name, opening address, business nature, type of goods sold, storage location, reason for transfer, transfer quantity, starting and ending locations, transfer date, manager's name, etc. The starting or ending location of the transfer must comply with the information filled in on the form, and the date must not be changed. In addition, in order to understand the inventory of each member, the association will order members to fill in a report on the storage of goods every few days.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks rose significantly. Around 11:00, there was a twist, and by 11:40, the selling trend gradually subsided. Rongfeng Textile and China Film both soared in the buying trend. The buying trend of department stores, textiles, and other industry stocks was reignited. All stocks rose in unison, and the morale of all parties was greatly boosted. It is said that the stock exchange will open next Monday for a week of futures trading, and there are various favorable investment rumors. The silver root is not as tight as it has been in the past two decades. Today, the stock market conditions of various industries are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company slowly rose and then hovered. The buying trend picked up again at noon and suddenly broke through the barrier, and rose again in the afternoon; Sincere also rose sharply; the news of China Products' capital increase is not accurate, and the rise has slowed down; Innerwear and Lane Crawford Department Store have both risen; Textiles: Wing On Textile initially rose slightly, and returned slightly after the high in the afternoon, rising by more than a cattle grade compared to the previous day; China Textile's rise in the morning was limited, and suddenly hit a large barrier in the afternoon; Sincere began to rise slowly at noon; Rongfeng's rise was quite strong; Five Harmony Weaving's demand exceeded supply, and the transaction was quite active; Lunhua and Dah Kung were firm and consistent; Ruithai, Tianlun, Hongxing, and Dah Chungwah Weaving were flat; Jingfu Shirt Socks and Jinglun made no progress; Yuanyuan Printing and Dyeing's demand exceeded supply. New Drugs: Sinya and China France each saw higher prices, and were even more firm in the afternoon; Five Continents, New Star, and Nine Blessings Pharmaceuticals rose slightly; Syntex saw a decline alone. Culture: Commercial Press saw a high price with few demands and few supplies; China was done outside the barrier; World was flat; Yongxiang Printing Bureau was also stable.

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market turned tired again, although the number was limited, and the distance between high and low was very large, indicating that the sellers were still disposing of high prices, but the market price rebounded very easily and it was difficult to fall. Yesterday, Category C started to decline slightly, then hovered and rose, exceeding the price of the previous day, and then gradually retreated, finally falling slightly more than the previous day. It was heard that it rose again in the afternoon; Categories A, B, D, and E were still hovering.</p>
<p>Call Rate: Yesterday, the call rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.7 cents, which has not changed.</p>
<p>Food: Because there was a lot of arrival and weak sales yesterday, the trend became tired and fell. It was found that the difficulty of transporting rice and food along the way has been reduced, and vendors continue to come and go, and the retail arrival is very prosperous. In addition, after buyers were active for a while, the demand stomach relapsed, and the original weak-priced prices were once again reduced. Miscellaneous grain transactions were still rare, and the market was very happy and weak.</p>
<p>Rayon: Yesterday morning, the initial opening was calm, but suddenly received financial stimulation, and the shouting quality rose sharply. However, details of the formal transaction</p>
<p>Hemp Bags: The market was quite dull yesterday, showing a state of supply and demand scarcity, with very few transactions. Both new bags and white line bags were the same as before, only Hangzhou Luoma arrived rarely and was slightly firm.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Match distribution has already started, and the authorities will also announce the soap distribution date, so the market is stable and the price has not changed much. It is heard that the official price will be sold in the future, based on the limited price approved on September 15. There are six types of distribution brands, including Gu Ben, Scissors, Star, Five Star, Bull, and Ting Li.</p>
<p>Overcoat Wool: The trend has been gradually smooth recently. Nanjing gangs have purchased successively. Men's and women's clothing stores and overcoat workshops in this city, as well as the second-hand goods gangs, are also in the sample purchase, and the lower-end goods to the most expensive wool materials are all sold, especially the ordinary gray herringbone, etc., are more active.</p>
<h3>New Logos Should Be Filed First</h3>
<p>The various industry trade associations have been reorganized separately under orders, and are actively promoting association affairs. However, the use of their new logos must be submitted to the Wang Guan agency for filing in advance with three copies of the documents and seals, otherwise they cannot be considered legal. However, the old logos do not need to be returned to prevent fraud.</p>
<h3>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Cracks Down on the Smuggling of Flour and Wheat and Sends Letters to Various Relevant Parties for Assistance</h3>
<p>Since the National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented the purchase of wheat and distributed it to flour mills in various regions to produce flour and distribute it to various regions for supply and demand, the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat has become increasingly smooth. In order to crack down on smuggling, it has submitted a request to the Commercial Control Committee to notify China Central Railway Company, inland river shipping companies, etc. to pay attention to assistance at any time. All requests to load wheat or bran, whether for export or transportation to Shanghai, must be certified by the branch offices of the Flour and Wheat Zhai Committee, whether they hold a license or are moving within the district without a license, otherwise they will be refused to load.</p>

<p>Public Opinion in the Republic of China</p>
<h3>Discussion of Cloth Rationing</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>Since the National Defense Council's decision to purchase cotton cloth, it has been more than four months. On the eve of cloth rationing, we must conduct a serious review. Cloth rationing is not as simple as other daily necessities but a very complex task. Various departments must be decided upon by experts. For example, the collection of raw cotton from producing areas and distribution to yarn factories for spinning have led to the creation of the Cotton Control Association to plan everything. I will now briefly describe some aspects of the weaving and dyeing industry and cloth rationing scheme, for consideration by the authorities.</p>
<p>After the completion of the purchase work, the cloth purchase office will be dissolved immediately and replaced by an agency for the disposal of cloth rationing, which is a very simple solution. If this agency directly distributes existing yarn stocks or new production from yarn factories to cloth factories and knitting factories, then the existing yarn brokerage industry will inevitably be eliminated. However, since this industry is highly speculative, it is necessary to eliminate it in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism and reduce the burden on citizens. Looking at the number of yarn brokerage industry members before and after the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, the number has more than doubled. This is because members have the right to apply for the removal of yarn, so most yarn brokers with sufficient strength register with two or three brand names in order to enjoy more benefits from the removal. Although this is not universally true, it is mostly the case. With such flexible freedom, it is difficult to prevent speculation.</p>
<p>There are more than 710 cloth factory members, and countless knitting and cotton weaving factories. If each factory applies directly for yarn allocation, it would be overwhelming. To allocate to the guilds, and then have the guilds distribute to the member factories, it would be difficult to avoid various malpractices. Therefore, the current cloth factory industry is preparing to divide and manage districts. That is, to unite several small factories in close proximity and with similar interests to form a group, and elect a group leader to be responsible for receiving the allocated yarn and distributing it to the factories under their jurisdiction. In this way, they are mostly colleagues who are close neighbors and see each other every day, so I can confidently say that there will be no cheating. In this way, factories that have never cooperated can also practice a spirit of unity and cooperation. For example, a business with a dozen looms usually has more than enough one warp winding worker, while a business with twenty or more looms may find one insufficient and two excessive. Other processes, such as yarn rewinding, require three to four workers for a small 50-spindle winding machine. If fewer workers are used, the motor must still be turned on. With this group organization, they can communicate with each other, and both manpower and resources can be saved, which is indeed beneficial to the current wartime controlled economy. Other matters such as technical cooperation, product improvement, promotion, and supervision are even more easily achieved.</p>
<p>After rationing, if the authorities designate uniform weaving and then purchase the finished products for distribution to various places, this step may not be ideal, as both manpower and resources are uneconomical. What should be the basis for the allocation of yarn and thread? Can the technology be unified? These are all problems. Most white cloth factories use yarn as warp, while colored cloth factories use double-strand thread as warp, because colored cloth factories do not have sizing tanks or sprayers. Therefore, it is better to have each factory apply for the yarn and thread they need for one or two months, and give full play to their strengths in weaving various textiles. After the authorities set prices, they can be sold to the market. After the transaction, profits are remitted to the authorities. Each retailer must have uniform regulations for the quantity purchased, which must include high-quality varieties, fair prices, and the goods needed by citizens. In this way, factories will inevitably compete to improve their products. If a factory's products are expensive and of poor quality, they will inevitably lack customers. If they use base methods and engage in illegal transactions, they will not be able to apply for removal permits. Moreover, the authorities can check and punish them at any time. Therefore, in order to request the second phase of yarn allocation, they must sell the first phase of products at a reduced price legally before applying. In this way, not only can new products be improved, but also the effect of suppressing commodity prices can be achieved. These are just superficial views, and I do not know if they are appropriate. I hope for corrections.</p>
<p>As for the amount of allocation, what standards should be used? Should it be distributed according to the number of looms, or based on the reserved quota? This is usually decided internally by the bureau.</p>

<h3>Appeal to Pulmonary Physicians to Serve Patients Collectively</h3>
<p>Illness is painful, and lung disease is even more so. In addition to being time-consuming and costly, sometimes the most reasonable treatment cannot be obtained, or the opportunity for early treatment is lost.</p>
<p>Isn't consulting a doctor the most reasonable treatment? Isn't it the least likely to miss the opportunity for early treatment? Actually, that's not always the case. Doctors in Shanghai vary in skill, and even experts may not agree on diagnoses. For example, one patient is told by doctor A that there is a cavity in the lung, while doctor B says there isn't. Doctor A says surgery is needed, while doctor B says it's unnecessary. Another patient is told by doctor A that the lungs are practically healthy, while doctor B says there is a disease, but it's very mild; doctor C says there is a disease, which is more serious than doctor B says, and even says it's progressive. The same disease, the same X-ray film, can have various interpretations and diagnoses. So what should the patient do?</p>
<p>This situation is very common. Initially, I thought there should be an organization for collective discussion. I heard that ophthalmologists have such an organization. Problematic cases can be discussed at regular meetings, so that patients can get the most accurate guidance. Or perhaps such an organization already exists, but it's just not being done well, so I appeal to the responsible gentlemen to put in more effort to serve the patients!</p>
<h3>Recent News from Gezhi Society</h3>
<p>The society was founded by colleagues from the Business and Science colleges of Guanghua University. The address is No. 270 Chengdu Road. The eleventh term will begin registration today and classes will start on the 19th. New students are also being recruited. To facilitate the continuing education of working youth, part of the curriculum is scheduled from 4:30 PM to 8:30 PM daily.</p>
<p>Briefcase to be Claimed Around 12:00 on the 11th of this month, a rickshaw puller (rickshaw license number 1587 in the first district) found a black business briefcase left behind by a passenger. The owner is requested to claim it at the Lao Zha sub-bureau of the First Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>Free Treatment for Lung Disease to Begin with the Education Sector, Measures Determined by the China Health Association</h3>
<p>The China Health Association will launch a lung health check campaign this month, with a total of 10,000 people. 10,000 free X-ray check vouchers will be distributed by the following: The entire education sector in Shanghai will be distributed by the Social Services Department of the Xinwen Bao newspaper. The entire business sector in Shanghai will be distributed by the Social Services Department of the Shen Bao newspaper (must be obtained with a letter of proof). Physicians of the Physicians Association will distribute to the general poor and sick. Donors will have the vouchers mailed to them by the association for redistribution, in order to popularize them. Starting today, the Social Services Department will be expanded to engage in practical relief work for the poor and sick, with the following measures:</p>
<p>The association believes that people in the education sector are most likely to suffer from lung disease, and many live in poverty, so the relief work will begin with the education sector, in order to easily popularize it, and therefore, the relief work will begin with the education sector.</p>
<p>Any educational personnel in this city (including teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and elementary schools) who are suspected of having lung disease can obtain a free check certificate from the Social Services Department of the Xinwen Bao newspaper with a certificate from the school authorities, and the association will provide free check. If lung disease is found, treatment can be applied for, but the quota is limited to 200 people.</p>
<p>After the applicant is approved by the association, the association will implement compression treatment until full recovery. However, the individual illness must undergo long-term treatment, which will take at least about a year. The patient should be persistent. If treatment is stopped midway, not only is the medical expense wasted, but there is no benefit to the patient himself. Therefore, in order to encourage patients to achieve the goal of full treatment, once approved, a guarantor must be responsible (if the treatment is stopped midway without a good reason, the full year's medical expenses must be reimbursed).</p>

<h3>First Place Essay Contest of the Confucian Society: How to Practice the Eight Virtues (1)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yaoshou</p>
<p>The three virtues of Hongfan, the six virtues of Zhouguan, hence there are four virtues, the Book calls them nine virtues. The name of eight virtues is not found in ancient times. Only Mencius said: "If their children follow them, then they are filial, fraternal, loyal, and trustworthy." Guan Zhong said: "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a state." The name of the eight virtues in modern times, is it formed by collecting these! Although, the Way is one, and when discussing its minor details and actions, there are thousands of distinctions and it is impossible to enumerate them all. When discussing its great foundation, it is applicable in all corners of the world, and does not change through thousands of generations. The former sages and the later sages all follow the same principle. How can the Great Way have many paths! As for analyzing the eight virtues and discussing them in detail, the narrations of the ancients are complete, and there are various books on the principles of human nature. However, virtue is what one obtains from oneself. Cheng Bozi said: "If you cannot preserve and nurture it, you are just talking." Yan Xizhai said: "A heart that is aware, words that are spoken, essays that are written, without being practiced by the body, are all useless." Therefore, abandoning the practice of daily life and engaging in lofty discussions of chapters and sentences is truly speaking without propriety, and if the words do not relate to righteousness, then they are not followers of the sages. I will abandon superficial discussions and talk about how to practice virtue diligently.</p>
<p>The Way is like a great road, how difficult is it to know and act! Nowadays, filial piety, fraternity, and loyalty are known! Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be done. Easy is easy to know, simple is easy to follow, so even farmers in the fields and foolish couples in the deep mountains can understand. People who know the Way that everyone knows and do things that are easy to know and simple to do, it is fitting that saints fill the streets and families can be ennobled. However, a saint appears once in a thousand years, and a wise man once in five hundred years, how difficult is it to attain! It is because they cannot establish their will! If one's will is not established, one drifts along with the world, wasting time day after day. Even for a small number of games, one cannot achieve anything without focusing one's attention. How much more so for this lifelong matter, can one waste time and do nothing? Empty words without action are not enough to be called will; a fierce appearance with a cowardly heart is not enough to be called will. If one can be so determined as to forget food, and have the will to die in the evening after hearing the Way, then benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not bestowed from outside, and one has the inherent good knowledge and ability, self-establishment, self-achievement, and self-attainment. How far away is it! However, most people in the world are blinded by material desires and lose their original mind, so they cannot establish their will. When they accumulate wealth to enrich their wives and children, they discard filial piety and fraternity like worn-out shoes. When they engage in deceit and cunning, they treat loyalty and trustworthiness as exhausted cakes. When they conspire to monopolize and cut off supply, they say, what use is propriety and righteousness? When they beg and scheme, they say, what use is integrity and shame? Alas! This is leading the people to become beasts, how pitiful! Parrots and orangutans can speak human words, but if people do not practice filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and trustworthiness, and only focus on food, clothing, shelter, and movement, then they are just beasts! If one can feel shame and fear, and not be content to be a villager for the rest of one's life, and seek the Way of the sages and practice it in all actions, then living in a safe house and following the right path, is it not within our power! However, Mencius said: "If you do not understand goodness, you will not make your person sincere." Hengqu said: "Once you know what to establish, you will not worry about not being precise in governance." In recent times, learning has declined and evidence has been cut off. The work of guessing and imitating, the semblance of imitation, is all over the place. If you do not distinguish for a moment, then you will be measuring the pillar with a ruler and heading north in the direction of Chu!</p>
