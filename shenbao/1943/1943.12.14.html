<p>自上海租界接收以來，迄今四匝月有半，回憶常交還之初，各界人士所表示热烈之歡忱與夫深切之期望，可見市民對於市政之關懷，有不可否認者。本報　以爲民喉舌爲己任，除追隨各界對於市政各部門亦略有所貢獻外，並將全部改進之細目歸納爲三大網要，曰，民意上達，日，人才優秀，曰，整飭吏治，似期綱舉目張而收水到渠成之效。凡市政之良　，直接受其影響者乃市民之本身而非市政當局，然改進市政則必須市政當局負其責，而非各個市民能力之所及。故市民陳述其苦痛理所當然，而當局之採納與情亦屬分內之事，不過市民有時因感到切膚之痛，而率直陳詞　亦爲人情之常。同時市政當局在特殊環境之下，一言一動至宜審愼，改絃更張尤須考慮，心有餘而力不足之苦，則市民亦當加以體會。官民原屬一體，彼此幽結一致，不但可以事半功倍，且以共同之力量可以掃除一切恢復光明之障礙。無論如何，凡問題之大者遠者，也許不能不費時曠日，四閱月亦屬百數十日耳，欲求顯著之成績，平時或已　責效過促，何况今日。因此吾人對於前四五個月所建識或論列之問題，均假定已在市政長官考慮之中，容或尚有若干困難故未能見諸施行，自當　待時機之成熟而毌庸煩喋。茲僅堪一二惠而不費之瑣事，在市政當局稍加舉手投足之勞，而使市民受益匪淺者。</p>
<p>滬市街道至少在中國各都市中向以整潔著稱，而邇來人行道上之積垢，竟有屢日不見情除者。垃圾箱之四周狼藉徧地，雖在此冬令亦必掩鼻而過。此不僅有損觀瞻，亦且礙及衛生。而市民則身歴其境有不能巳於言者一也。</p>
<p>公用交通工具其目的在爲公眾服務，舉凡與公眾不方便之缺點應加革除。例如果車王下如何使其秩序井然，司機及售票人員如何使其謙訓有禮，在在均有整頓之必耍，各該公司當然負直接之責任，而市政機關負督察之責者，亦應盡其最大之努力，以求改善。市民爲衣食奔波，有賴於公用交通工具便利之切，亦非各長官所能想像，此所以不能巳於言者二也。</p>
<p>界口設岡檢間，在非常時期誠屬必要，共目的在確保治安而非藉以擾民·故達禁條例應揭示於通衢，使人知所去就。繼有干犯而受處罰，則在執行者有所根據，而被罰者亦心悅誠服。市政當局耳目不周或有所不知，而市民因感行路之難有不能巳於言者三也。</p>
<p>以上三點僅就行的方面而揮其最瑣細者，提供於市政當局之前，請求改善，或不致有所牽摰而復遭擱置·苟市政當局能顧及市民行路之苦痛，嚴飭所屬不稍假借，則朝發令而夕可收效。吾人願拭目以俟。</p>

<p>中央社訊　供給華中地區電力之華中水電公司，及軍管理上海電力公司，（包會滬西電力公司）自十二月一日起，對全體用戶實施電方消費限制，此係因主要發電資源之煤崴，來源缺乏，而爲協力完成大東亞戰爭不得巳之措置，蓋煤爲增强戰刀最重要之資源，此次限制用電，就全體言之，約爲三成左有，限制制辦法之規定，對於各種　業，對時局之重要性及增强戰力安定民生各點，均會詳加考慮，茲將該兩公司所訂定各種不同之電力消費限度十多舉如下：</p>
<p>但右表之限制，在南京上海二區，每月仍維持最低有二十五度，其他地區每月最低有二十度之消費限度。</p>
<p>種類區別說明</p>
<p>第一種，一切軍用及維持治安所必需者屬之。第二種，計割塵業及其他爲培養戰力所必要者屬之。（甲類）特別需要者及其他重要工廠業務塲所，另行指定者屬之。（乙頭）同業公會之未列入甲類者，及其他特定爲本煩者屬之。第三種，不屬第一種第二種第四種及電热電燈用之普通用途者屬之。第四種，凡用於裝飾或奢侈方面者屬之。計分甲乙二類辦理，（甲類）應　格限制者·此類包括各種酒摟茶室·咖啡店·理髪美容及一切娛樂塲所，（乙類）應禁止者·此類包括美術電飾，覽虹燈，廣　燈，庭　燈，（公　除外）電熨斗及暖室用（醫　用除外）之電热等。電燈用，（甲類）住宅用，（乙類）其他。電热用，（甲類）住宅烹調用，（按照華中之燃料悄形）（乙類）暖室用。（同上）</p>
<p>消費限度標準</p>
<p>消費制度之標準，其在華中水電公司供給區者，以民國三十一年十月，至本年十月間最高消費量之月計算，其在上海電力公司及滬西電力公司供給區者，則以本年八九十之三月間最高消費量之月爲標準。此種標準數量，由公司於事前通告各用戶，如超過規定之消費限度景者，則須增收電費其辦法如下；　超過景若達標準量之一成者，微將超過電費三倍。　超過量在一成以上至二成者，增收六倍。　超過量在二成以上者，增收二十倍。　凡用電如超過二次以上老，則照前項規定微赞外，並減低其消費限度，或逕行停止供電。又華中水電供電區之配給者，所以　於上海電力公司者，則因上海電力公司區內，由前年九月起鑒於煤的配給之威少，巳實行相當限制之故，此次限制用電，確因煤炭來源日趨缺乏所致，明知此舉不特使中國各種工業生產，深受影響，即一般電燈用戶，當亦感受不便，　對於電燈用戶在上海南京二區者，每月仍維持最低有二十五度之限度。其他地區亦每月有二十度，故對於普通用電較少之用戶，並無防碍。又對於增强戰力所必需之生產事業，視煤斤來源之情勢必要時，或可酌量，准予增加。即關於工廠之增設，自將同樣辦理，伹酒樓茶室夜間俱樂部睹塲理髪美容等　侈浪費傷所，當予以　格之限制，至一切電飾美滿廣吿，以及浴室暖室等所用之電热，則予停供。此次限制用電，影響固大，然値此艱雄時會，實屬萬不得巳，希望各界用戶能各本節省物力之旨，無論家庭工廠，務使一度電力之微均作最有效而合理之使用，倘仍如以往之任意消耗，則爲通應局勢計，恐將再加以　格之限制。</p>

<p>該會並鍳於媢禮日　　　，特呈請社會福利部設司登記，以重　敎，而挽風氣。文日——竊以婚姻者，人倫之始，世界生命存續之原也。我國自夏商三代以來，制禮作樂，婚禮與喪禮並重，蓋一以愼終，一以敦怡，三禮所傳昏義見於禮記，士晉禮著於儀禮，而訂婚之事，則周文王娶太姒時，見之於詩經日：「文定厥祥，親迎於渭」。於左博晋公則有「齊大非耦』之語，古人之於婚禮若是其愼重也。我江浙蠶桑富庶之區，對於男婚女嫁，踵事增華，糜費尤冠於全國。始則富厚之家，聘儀奩增，交相關富，自後風氣所趨，雖中人之資，亦相率效尤，至不惜售產負價，爲兒女婚嫁，甚至,以奩贈之豐儉，爲翁姑對待新婦厚薄之標準，而女宅對於夫家，則有聘金開門錢奩贈脚力之種　需衆，各有使對方故意爲難之情形。又舊式婚姻，事前彼此漢不相　，全憑父母之命，媒妁之曾，婚後多數雖能相安，白頭借老，而彼此不相得者，占脫輻而賦仳離，往往有之。又女性固執者，失歡夫家，多憂鬱成疾。而男子則置姬妾，結外遇，家庭遂多事故由於婚姻未愼於始之所致也。民國華興，知雙方當事人有先聯友誼之必要，彼此情投意合，較盲目婚姻固屬差勝，而離婚之案，則更多者，何也？蓋舊時夫婦，心目中尚有禮教維持·貧富尚能安命，今則類以金錢爲結合之媒，因生活困苦而親同陌路者普濟於各　層間，其勞然也。現在結婚，雖有正式之婚　，及戶口異動之呈報，而官廳尚無專爲婚姻登記之機關。按周禮「媒氏　萬民之判，儿男女自成名以上皆　年月日名　，令男三十而娶，女二十而嫁，凡娶判妻人子者，皆書之，（中略）凡嫁子娶　，入幣純帛無過五國」云云。是登記婚姻，在成周時即已實行·而聰禮又規定無過五兩，所以杜糜費，而免因此婚期　滯也。</p>
<p>鈞部主持社會福利事業，婚姻九爲人生必經過之一事，擬請設立專司，辦理登記婚姻事務，如周官媒氏之職掌，以提倡禮教,而抑制陋習·　合於三代敬愼重正之遺意，實我社會人民所馨香禱祝者爲。謹呈社會福利部部長丁</p>

<h3 id="c46">法律的破壞與道德的墮落 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 周饒英</p>
<p>讀了靑田東　先生的「法的神聖性一（十二月十二日申報星期評論）使我發生了好幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，中國從淸季到現在的百年問，什麽叫道德，什麽呌法律，似乎巳不能談了。尤其事變以後的現在，好像打仗把人心打　了。囘憶事變前，股法敗德的事悄，秪有不齒於人的人偷偷摸摸地做，『號衣差員』尙不至公然,向「雲吞」「豆腐腦」「擦鞋」小眅等收保護費，「流氓小嘍嘍」尙不至搖身一變而成為官吏，買官賣法的事情也不至毫無願忌。打仗使人心理到不可設想，許多人做了毀法敗德的事情似乎還有保隨，其身的小來態度，伹長此下去，不走小乘的人，也惟有連帶的毀滅吧！</p>
<p>第二，日本人對中國事情關懷的很多，伹關懷到法律道德而且能夠誠　先生實在還是第一個人。我不認識吉田先生，伹　這一點，中國人就庶該致年，看看吉田先生的大作，我眞願意為他執鞭隨置了。道德法律不能建樹基礎，國家一切政治軍事經濟文化的努力都如浮沙築塔，一輩子也見不到實效，整個的國家不能有進步，對東亞又能夠有什麽幫助？是則中國之憂，也是東亞之憂，日本之憂啊！所以中國的迸德法律問　，我一向主張日本人士也應該注意，例如官吏贪汚事件，烟　的公然開設，如沒有日本方面的協助，我敢說中國方面是不會有澈底辦法的。現在吉田先生能夠那　热心的提出來，我不禁爲中國賀。更要爲日本賀呢！</p>
<p>第三，法律的戰壞與逍德的墮落，旣是中國與日本共同憂盧的事情，那末要想挽救，我以爲也要共同設法。好在有例可援，例如箪事同盟，經濟提携等等，不是都巳經實行了嗎？又文化溝通方面，也是着着實現了。道德法律方面，淸通的話自然說不上，決不能把中國馬路小販小雜貨店收保護費，以及買官賣法一類的風氣　到日本去，更不能杷鴉片烟和　博推廣到日本去。但日本的官吏憲兵警察那種廉潔奉公，忠於職守的精神，移植到中國來，這是可以從根本上把中國救起來。至於道德法律上，日本怎樓授助中國的話。說來又很抽象，我看中國恐怕不能也成立什麼「中日遒德協會」吧。但我們想，如日本在華的各秤組織以及個人，如能對中國的道德法律問題多多注意，尤其輿中國人士有所交際往來的時候，務要注意到自己的中國朋友或中國　冒有否舞弊犯法，或以自己爲靠山而去有組織有計割的犯罪。目本人士對中日人的態度，認爲中　人可以放任，日本人自己則必須嚴　，實則中國人一般的態度，認爲與日本人士接近的中國人，或在日本人士影響下的中國人，他們犯的揮，都記在日本人的　上，這豈不造成歴史上的大寃枉。所以日本應眩不分界限，對逍德法律應該有一體促進的決心，尤其來中國服務的日本人士，必須堅持「與人爲善」的誠意，不可疏忽爲中國的惡人所利用，致遺放縱中國人作惡的冤枉艱。</p>
<p>第四，道德法律的敗壞，我想了很多年，我認爲這個責任決不在於下國，而是在於上廚。若就政治的作用而論，　道個責任又當由衣朝者來負，在野者是不能苛求的。雖然道德法律之敗壤由來已久，並非紀於今日，不過在朝一日的人，便要負一日挽救頹風的責任。中國歴來在朝的人，大多急念平保護自己的權位，有時過到重要的澈退關頭。爲了求進不甘退　，不惜親手做出毀法　德的事來，在朝如此，在野更不必說，宜乎整個的道德法律日趨隋落了。關於這個國家吏治的整頓問題，我早巳主張要從合理的員吏組織着手，員吏有組織，才能有保證，也才能求進步，否則大家「五日京兆」，朝不保暮，還是死路一條。英美德法諸國在第一次大戰之前，他們史治的腐敗與中國今日不相上下，徐來成立員吏組織，便漸漸的進步了。當然，員吏組織的成立不能不慎重，不過中國道德法律之眞實的進步必在負吏成立組鐵之後吧。因爲員吏尚不能自治，人民更何從談自治，員吏尚不能民主，政府更何從談民主，這是國家進步的基本關鍵啊！</p>
<p>上面還許多華都太　肆了，不過我賓在欽服吉田束祐先生的文章，不覺衝動而冒險的說了那許多不愼重的話。敬求吉田先生和其他關心者的指教。</p>

<p>在眞人八歲的那年春天。　當地的八幡尋常小學。也就是現在吉田濃的八幡國民小學的前　。</p>
<p>『要好好地聽先生的話呀！』</p>
<p>在初上學的早晨，母親者子，這檬的說着，交給他一條新的手巾。因為哥哥多，所以書包裙子（日本禮裝所穿的，譯者註）課本都可以用　的，但　問所　的手巾，和學生帽，可是嶄新的。</p>
<p>在那地方，沒有母親携着男孩于的手，直送到學校去的，那種文弱的風習。</p>
<p>眞人隨着三年級生的哥哥太郎，沈默地踏過了最初的學枚門。最使他喜歡的，是書包裏頭　帶着飯盒子呢！</p>
<p>下課的時間，高級學生，有角力的。新學生們大多戰戰兢競地　着鐵積子，騎着木馬。</p>
<p>眞人看見還些熱鬧的光景，只是嬉嬉的笑着。在白面孔上發起的紅潤臉色，露着潔白可愛的細齒，眞是方言所脫的一個「美少年」的象微。</p>
<p>「谷的譣兒，倒像一個蘋果似的。」</p>
<p>快的一個小朋友，已經提住了眞人面孔的特徵。南國的兒童，不曉得蘋果還有靑的。光滑的圓瞼免，兩頰紅潤着的真人，確好像童話　上的撞　發果——長上了眼睛鼻子似的。</p>
<p>「蘋果呀！蘋果呀！」</p>
<p>雖然被人取笑著，眞人仍舊沈默地，嬉嬉地笑着。從那天以很，什麼『蘋果』『眞人輩果』的綽號，就一直繼續到他的少年時代的告終。</p>
<p>伹是，「蘋果」並非只是旁觀着小朋友們的遊戲。若被人誘引的時候，便欣然加入他們的　伴。因爲身體重的關係，對器械體操是不甚喜爱的，角力却有榦長。小小的身驅確是有堅强的毅力，支持到最後。而隆夫則不然了。前後左右，一碰便倒。</p>
<p>「隆失——加油呀！」</p>
<p>眞人，倒爲他義慣，而聲援着。</p>
<p>上學，是一種最渝快的事情。帶着飯盆子去，和很多的小朋友玩——若說是吃苦頭，也不過担任的先生，特別的嚴厲，功髁做的不好，就要吃「栗殻」。「票效」就是用指節向頭上撞，再痛也沒有的了。</p>
<p>可是，在這一年級生迎最初的新年以前，因爲大正天皇駕崩，所以學校都掛着帶黑布條的國旗，並且提早放假了。（六）</p>

<p>Since the handover of the Shanghai concessions, four and a half months have passed. Recalling the fervent joy and deep expectations expressed by people from all walks of life at the beginning of the handover, it is evident that citizens undeniably care about municipal affairs. This newspaper considers serving as the voice of the people its duty. In addition to following the contributions of various sectors to municipal affairs, it also summarizes all the details of improvement into three major guidelines: first, conveying public opinion; second, employing talented individuals; and third, rectifying official corruption. It aims to achieve effective governance through well-defined principles. The citizens themselves, not the municipal authorities, are directly affected by good governance. However, improving municipal administration is the responsibility of the municipal authorities, not something individual citizens can accomplish. Therefore, it is only natural for citizens to express their suffering, and it is also within the authorities' duty to listen and adopt their opinions. However, it is also common for citizens to express their opinions frankly due to their firsthand experiences of suffering. At the same time, municipal authorities should be very careful with every word and action under special circumstances. Reforms must be carefully considered, and citizens should also understand the authorities' difficulties when their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Officials and the people are originally one, and their close unity can not only achieve twice the result with half the effort but also remove all obstacles to restoring brightness with common strength. In any case, major and long-term problems may inevitably take time. Four months is only a hundred and several dozen days. Seeking significant achievements too quickly may be inappropriate, especially today. Therefore, we assume that the issues identified or discussed in the previous four or five months are under consideration by municipal leaders. Perhaps there are still some difficulties preventing their implementation. We should wait for the right time and refrain from being repetitive. Here, we only mention a few trivial matters that can benefit the citizens greatly with a little effort from the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Shanghai's streets are known for their cleanliness among Chinese cities. However, recently, dirt has accumulated on sidewalks for days without being cleared. The areas around trash cans are littered, making it necessary to hold one's nose even in winter. This not only damages the appearance but also affects hygiene. Citizens who experience this firsthand cannot help but speak out. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The purpose of public transportation is to serve the public. Any inconveniences to the public should be eliminated. For example, how to maintain order on buses and trams, and how to ensure that drivers and ticket sellers are polite and courteous, all require rectification. The respective companies are directly responsible, and the municipal authorities, who are responsible for supervision, should also make their best efforts to improve the situation. Citizens rely on the convenience of public transportation for their livelihood, something that officials may not be able to imagine. This is why they cannot help but speak out. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Setting up checkpoints at junctions is necessary during extraordinary times. Their purpose is to ensure public security, not to harass the people. Therefore, relevant regulations should be displayed in prominent places so that people know what to do. If there are violations and punishments, the enforcers have a basis, and the punished are also convinced. The municipal authorities may not be aware of everything, and citizens who experience difficulties in their travels cannot help but speak out. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The above three points only focus on the most trivial aspects of travel, presented to the municipal authorities for improvement, hoping that they will not be hindered or shelved again. If the municipal authorities can consider the suffering of citizens in their travels and strictly order their subordinates not to make excuses, results can be achieved quickly. We are willing to wait and see.</p>

The Chongqing side has dispatched the 58th, 71st, and Provisional 2nd armies, which are mobile units of the 9th War Zone, to rush north to assist. These secondary aid troops had not yet formally confronted the Japanese army when they lost their will to fight. Although the supervisory teams were urging them tightly, they were cowardly and did not move forward. Instead, they constructed positions on the mountain tops to avoid Japanese artillery fire. On the contrary, the Japanese army skillfully carried out encirclements, gradually shrinking the encirclement. The Japanese army air force also cooperated with this and continuously bombed the Chongqing army's positions, inflicting heavy blows on the Chongqing army. Currently, this secondary Chongqing army is also in the same situation as the initial aid troops, gradually facing the crisis of being annihilated.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Ministry of Finance Actively Preparing Next Year's National Government New Budget, Determining That Revenue and Expenditure Can Maintain Balance <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the ministry at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 13th). He patiently answered various questions from the reporters regarding the National Government's budget for the coming year and the recent policies of the financial authorities. The full record is as follows:</p>
<p>"The National Government's New Budget for Next Year" The Ministry of Finance has been actively preparing the National Government's entire budget for next year for a long time. However, the price index has now increased again, and next year's budget is expected to be twice as high as in the past. It is planned to slightly increase the military expenditure, but at most it will not exceed 60%. All detailed plans are currently being actively reviewed. This procedure will be completed within this year.</p>
<p>"Recent Situation of Surveying and Coordinating Rural Finance" Under the current wartime system, rural production is the lifeblood of the country. Therefore, increasing agricultural production is an urgent task. However, in order to increase agricultural production, it is essential to survey and coordinate rural finance. The Bank of Communications is currently solely responsible for agricultural loans. The total amount of the first phase of loans was 10 million yuan, and the period was several months or even half a year. The results were very good. The bank is now planning to continue the second phase of lending, with the amount still being 10 million yuan, which can be realized soon.</p>
<p>"Circulation of Central Reserve Bonds in the Suhuai District" The Central Reserve Bond is the National Government's sole currency, and it has been operating smoothly since its introduction. In order to adjust the monetary system in the Suhuai area, the authorities stipulated that the Central Reserve Bond would be used in conjunction with the United Reserve Bank Bond in the Suhuai Special Zone, starting on December 1st. Although it has been implemented for only a short time, the situation is quite good. Circulation and other aspects are relatively smooth. It is rumored that prices in the area have risen since the two currencies were used together, which is an inevitable phenomenon after the implementation of the two currencies. It is believed that after the entire adjustment, it will definitely be able to achieve stability.</p>
<p>"The Increase in Reserve Bonds Affects Prices" Recently, various types of bonds in Shanghai have risen sharply, which has a significant impact on social finance and a correlated relationship with rising prices. The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this and has also consulted the Ministry of Industry to pay close attention to its development. When necessary, effective measures will be discussed to conform to the National Government's intention to stabilize finance.</p>
<p>"Construction Public Bonds of 600 Million Yuan" Regarding the funds for the Ministry of Construction to develop water conservancy and increase production, the authorities plan to issue construction public bonds in installments (assumed name), with a total planned amount of 600 million yuan. The detailed methods are being actively formulated. It will be issued in installments. The first phase may first issue 100 million to 200 million yuan to revitalize rural water conservancy and encourage increased production.</p>
<p>"Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Maintain Balance" The National Government's fiscal policy initially adopted a balanced budget, then changed to a focus on key areas, and now it has shifted to basing revenue on expenditure. Because next year's expenditure will increase by about onefold, revenue must also increase by about onefold. The objects of increase are tariffs and consolidated taxes. The method of increase is to gradually change the previous collection based on quantity to collection based on price to increase revenue. In short, the government now has a method to raise funds, and the revenue and expenditure for next year can definitely maintain balance.</p>
<p>"Trust Banks Absorb Floating Capital" Trust banks have been working tirelessly to stabilize social finance since July 1st of this year. Currently, most banks have completed capital increases. Three banks have been punished with the revocation of their business licenses because they do not comply with the regulations promulgated by the ministry. As for rumors that the government intends to merge the various banks, the authorities have not considered this at this time. Regarding the government's current plan to absorb floating capital from various regions for the development of inland industries, the detailed plan is being jointly formulated by the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and relevant departments such as the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Construction. A meeting will be held soon to discuss preparations, and this issue will soon have a concrete decision.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Haitong News Agency, the Reuters correspondent in Moscow stated: The tank battle in southern Russia has continued for a month and has now reached its peak. Both sides are now concentrating the most troops and artillery to fight to the death. Last night, 200 German tanks launched a fierce attack in a narrow area of the Soviet front. Marshal von Manstein also mobilized reserve troops to push the Soviet army back to Kiev. The German army shows no signs of fatigue, so there will inevitably be continued battles in the future. To the south of Kremenchug, the three armies of the Soviet army in the Krivoy Rog area are fighting fiercely with the German army. The German counterattacks are fierce, demonstrating the strength of the reserve forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the Soviet army attempted to land and reinforce troops northeast of Kerch from the Taman Peninsula at night, but was repelled by German coastal reconnaissance teams. 12 landing craft were sunk and 4 were severely damaged.

<h3 id="e18">Reinforcements for the Anti-Axis Forces, Preparing for a New Offensive; German Troops Defend Rome from Impregnable Terrain <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Huitong News Agency: There has been large-scale troop movement in the rear of the Anti-Axis front in Southern Italy, seemingly assembling forces in preparation for a new offensive. The Anti-Axis reinforcements newly arrived in Southern Italy include large contingents of tanks and artillery, all currently concentrated in the Mignano area. Based on the movements of recent days, the U.S. Fifth Army clearly appears to be preparing to launch a new offensive, with its target seemingly aimed at advancing along the Cassino highways. Several weeks ago, after the German rearguard retreated from San Pietro Infine, the minefields laid by the German forces proved effective in hindering the enemy's advance. Repeated enemy attacks north of Monte Trocchio have been repelled, with the heaviest losses suffered by the enemy north of Venafro. The British Eighth Army's activities on the Moro River are currently limited to localized offensives, attempting to expand its bridgehead.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report, following the Anti-Axis forces' 100-day struggle in Southern Italy, the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* made a brief commentary stating: "The Anti-Axis forces will hardly be able to celebrate Christmas in Rome." The London *Daily Express* stated that the losses suffered by the German forces during this period were extremely difficult because the German side used very few troops in this theater. In other words, the Anti-Axis forces have failed to tie down a large number of German troops in Southern Italy. According to German soldiers who have fought on the Eastern Front, the battles on the Eastern Front and in Italy are equally fierce, subjecting their bodies and minds to immense torment. Manpower and resources on the Eastern Front are dispersed across a battlefield stretching thousands of kilometers, while in Southern Italy, they are concentrated in a mountainous area spanning only 1-3 kilometers. Since the Anti-Axis forces began their offensive in late November, the British Army has advanced approximately 15 kilometers along the Sangro River and Moro River, and the American forces in the west have advanced approximately 30 kilometers. Although the U.S. Army has recently overcome the difficult terrain of the Liri Valley in its advance towards Rome, the terrain in the west is still advantageous for the defending forces because the Liri Valley is only about 1 kilometer wide and is separated from the sea by mountains as high as 1,000 meters, making the surrounding high mountains advantageous for the defending forces.</p>

<p>Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: Syria and Lebanon continue to request that France end its mandate over the Near East. Yesterday, when General Catroux held a meeting with the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon, the two Prime Ministers proposed three suggestions: 1. The French High Commissioner's office should be changed to an embassy. 2. Police powers must be transferred to the Syrian and Lebanese governments respectively. 3. French influence in the Syrian and Lebanese customs must be completely abolished, and all revenue must be handed over to local government agencies; in addition, French personnel at all customs stations must be replaced. All newspapers in Syria and Lebanon unanimously support this request. General Catroux's attitude toward this request is currently unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e29">China Central and Shanghai Electric Power Companies Announce Measures for Implementing Restrictions on Electricity Consumption <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that China Central Hydroelectric Power Company, which supplies electricity to the Central China region, and the military-managed Shanghai Electric Power Company (including the West Shanghai Electric Power Company) will implement electricity consumption restrictions for all users starting from December 1st. This is an unavoidable measure to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War due to the scarcity of coal, the primary resource for power generation. Coal is the most important resource for enhancing combat power. The electricity consumption restriction will affect the total electricity output by approximately 30%. The regulations for the restriction measures have thoroughly considered the importance of various industries to the current situation, enhancing combat power, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. The different electricity consumption limits set by the two companies are listed below:</p>
<p>However, the restrictions in the table above will still maintain a minimum consumption limit of 25 kWh per month in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas and 20 kWh per month in other areas.</p>
<p>Category Description</p>
<p>Category 1: All military uses and those necessary for maintaining public order. Category 2: Planned industries and others necessary for cultivating combat power (Category A) Those with special needs and other important factory business premises, designated separately. (Category B) Those not listed in Category A and the same-industry associations, and others specifically designated as such. Category 3: Ordinary uses that do not belong to Categories 1, 2, or 4, and those for electric heating and electric lights. Category 4: Those used for decoration or luxury. Managed in two categories, A and B (Category A) Those that should be strictly restricted. This category includes all types of restaurants, teahouses, coffee shops, barber shops, beauty salons, and all entertainment venues. (Category B) Those that should be prohibited. This category includes artistic electric decorations, neon lights, advertising lights, garden lights (excluding public ones), electric irons, and electric heating for greenhouses (excluding medical uses), etc. For electric lights, (Category A) residential use, (Category B) other. For electric heating, (Category A) residential cooking use (according to the fuel situation in Central China), (Category B) greenhouse use (same as above).</p>
<p>Consumption Limit Standards</p>
<p>The standard for the consumption system is calculated based on the month with the highest consumption between October of the 31st year of the Republic of China and October of this year in the supply area of China Central Hydroelectric Power Company, and based on the month with the highest consumption between August, September, and October of this year in the supply area of Shanghai Electric Power Company and West Shanghai Electric Power Company. The company will notify each user of this standard quantity in advance. Those who exceed the specified consumption limit will be charged an increased electricity fee as follows:</p>
<p>If the amount exceeded reaches 10% of the standard quantity, the excess electricity bill will be tripled. If the amount exceeded is between 10% and 20%, the fee will be increased sixfold. If the amount exceeded is over 20%, the fee will be increased twentyfold. If electricity usage exceeds the limit more than twice, the consumption limit will be reduced or the power supply will be directly suspended, in addition to the fines levied according to the previous regulations. The reason that the allocation to the Central China Hydroelectric Power supply area is looser than that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company is because the Shanghai Electric Power Company area has already implemented considerable restrictions since September of last year due to the scarcity of coal allocation. The current restriction on electricity consumption is indeed due to the increasingly scarce coal supply. It is known that this move will not only deeply affect the production of various Chinese industries, but also cause inconvenience to general electricity users. However, for electricity users in the Shanghai and Nanjing areas, a minimum limit of 25 kWh per month will still be maintained. Other areas will also have 20 kWh per month, so there will be no obstacle for users who use less electricity. In addition, for production enterprises necessary to enhance combat power, an increase may be allowed as necessary, depending on the situation of the coal supply. The same will be done for the establishment of new factories. However, luxury and wasteful places such as restaurants, teahouses, nightclubs, gambling venues, barber shops, and beauty salons will be subject to strict restrictions, and the electricity supply for all electric decorations, beautiful advertisements, and electric heating used in bathrooms and greenhouses will be suspended. Although the impact of this electricity restriction is great, it is indeed an unavoidable measure in these difficult times. It is hoped that users in all sectors can adhere to the principle of saving resources and use even a small amount of electricity most effectively and reasonably, whether at home or in the factory. If they continue to consume electricity arbitrarily as in the past, then stricter restrictions may be imposed in order to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that recently, there have been rumors in the city that the Central Reserve Bank will issue 500-yuan notes. This rumor has been gaining momentum, and people even spoke of it as if they had seen it with their own eyes. A Central News Agency reporter, considering that this matter concerns financial trends, specially paid a visit to Finance Minister Zhou, who is also the President of the Central Reserve Bank, who was visiting Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 11th), in order to understand the truth. He was granted an audience and said that this matter was purely a groundless rumor. Because the issuance of the bank's notes is very sound, there is no need to issue 500-yuan notes. He has repeatedly stated in previous talks that he deeply hopes that the public will not lightly believe rumors and cause unnecessary disturbances.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Petition from the Citizens Welfare Association: Return of Charitable Surtaxes for Allocation to Effective Charitable Organizations <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens Welfare Association of this city, recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Government regarding the allocation of surtaxes previously collected by the Refugee Relief Association to local charitable organizations with proven track records. The document stated: "It is noted that since the outbreak of the war in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], refugees have sought shelter in dense areas. Initially, the Shanghai Joint Relief Association, formed by various charitable organizations, raised funds for their sustenance. Subsequently, when these charitable groups faced difficulties in providing sufficient aid, the Refugee Relief Association was jointly established by Chinese and foreign business communities. With the consent of the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, a 5% surtax was levied on restaurants and hotels, and approximately a 10% surtax on entertainment, to finance relief efforts. In the spring of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], as refugees gradually dispersed, the former Municipal Council and the French Concession Council, citing budgetary constraints, appropriated these surtaxes for their own use, incorporating them into their regular budgets, hindering all relief endeavors. In the spring of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], British council members, anticipating the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and their inability to remain in their positions for long, proposed a 2% additional surtax when retiring without proper pensions. The revenue from this item was quite substantial. As a result, they achieved their desired outcome upon retirement, and the council accumulated a significant surplus. Given that the aforementioned budget is already secured, the previously established surtaxes, originally intended for relief purposes, should be returned for the benefit of the people. Shanghai's charitable organizations, which derive their resources from the people and use them for the people, have achieved remarkable successes but are facing financial difficulties that threaten their sustainability. It is requested that the Mayor instruct the relevant departments to promptly review and approve a plan for the unified allocation of these surtaxes, originally levied for relief, to benefit the impoverished. The undersigned humbly awaits your prompt action. Respectfully submitted to Chen, Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3 id="e38">Submission to the Ministry of Welfare Requesting the Establishment of a Marriage Registration Bureau <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing the increasing decline of marital customs, the association has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Social Welfare to establish a dedicated bureau for marriage registration, to emphasize ritual education and restore social mores. The document states: "Marriage is the foundation of human relationships and the origin of the continuation of life in the world. Since the Xia, Shang, and Three Dynasties, our country has established rites and created music, placing equal emphasis on marriage and funeral ceremonies, one to ensure a proper end, and the other to promote harmony. The significance of marriage, as transmitted through the Three Rites, is found in the 'Meaning of Marriage' in the Book of Rites, and the rites for scholars and officials are detailed in the Book of Etiquette. The betrothal ceremony is mentioned in the Book of Songs in relation to King Wen of Zhou's marriage to Tai Si: 'He divined for her auspiciousness, and personally welcomed her on the Wei River.' In Zuo Zhuan, Duke Zhao of Jin stated, 'A great state should not be mismatched.' The ancients placed great importance on marriage. In the Jiangzhe region, known for its sericulture and wealth, customs surrounding marriage have become increasingly extravagant, with expenses exceeding those of the rest of the country. Initially, wealthy families engaged in elaborate betrothal gifts and dowries, leading to a competition of wealth. Subsequently, this trend has spread, and even families of modest means follow suit, even at the cost of selling property or taking on debt for their children's marriages. Furthermore, the richness of the dowry has become the standard by which mothers-in-law treat their daughters-in-law, while the bride's family demands excessive betrothal money, 'door-opening fees,' and 'dowry transport fees' from the groom's family, each deliberately making things difficult for the other. In addition, in traditional marriages, the parties involved do not know each other beforehand, relying entirely on the decisions of their parents and the words of matchmakers. While many marriages result in harmony and lifelong companionship, there are also cases of incompatibility, leading to separation and divorce. Furthermore, women who are stubborn often suffer from depression due to unhappiness in their marital homes, while men keep concubines and engage in extramarital affairs, leading to family strife, all due to a lack of proper consideration at the beginning of marriage. Since the founding of the Republic, it has been recognized that it is necessary for both parties to establish friendship beforehand, and mutual affection is certainly better than blind marriage, but the number of divorces is even greater. Why is this? Because in the past, couples still had rites and teachings to maintain harmony, and the poor were content with their lot. Now, marriage is often based on money, and poverty leads to estrangement, a common occurrence among all levels of society, which is indeed lamentable. Currently, while there are formal marriage certificates and reports of household registration changes, government offices do not have a dedicated agency for marriage registration. According to the Rites of Zhou, 'The matchmaker manages the separations of the people, records the year, month, and day names of all men and women above the age of adulthood, and instructs men to marry at thirty and women at twenty. All those who marry or divorce wives or sons are recorded. (omitted) For all marriages and betrothals, the value of silk and currency shall not exceed five liang.' This shows that marriage registration was practiced in the Zhou Dynasty, and the Rites of Zhou stipulated a limit of no more than five liang to curb extravagance and avoid delays due to financial issues.</p>
<p>Your Ministry presides over social welfare, and marriage is an essential aspect of human life. We propose the establishment of a dedicated bureau to handle marriage registration matters, similar to the duties of the matchmaker in the Zhou Dynasty, to promote ritual education and suppress undesirable customs, in line with the respectful and solemn intentions of the Three Dynasties. This is what our society and people earnestly hope for. Respectfully submitted to Ding, Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare."</p>

<p>Land Prices Soar Along the Two Railways</p>
<p>Local real estate companies and merchants have experienced an extraordinary boom in business recently, reaping substantial profits. In particular, over the past six months, the extensive activities of large and small companies along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have generated profits that are often unimaginable to outsiders. The latest situation is described below.</p>
<p>Idle Capital Turns to Real Estate</p>
<p>Local idle capital is abundant. In the past, it was mainly used for hoarding goods. Since the authorities began to severely crack down on hoarding at the beginning of this year, a large amount of idle capital has sought alternative outlets. In addition to a portion flowing into rural areas to engage in the purchase of agricultural products, a portion has turned to buying and selling real estate. Among them, merchants with a broader vision have developed activities in major cities along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, engaging in large-scale activities inland and daring to buy real estate. The profits obtained have been very substantial. The amounts over the past six months are quite considerable.</p>

<p>The trend of raising Chinese stock prices has gradually become popular again yesterday. Optimistic investment information has reappeared, and all parties suddenly feel alarmed. In particular, the surge in the prices of small textile stocks is the most significant. The price of Fongs is broken through the big level. Innerwear, Hongxing, and Tongji are the most sought after, while Yong'an and Zhenchang are flat. The increase of China Film is also considerable. China-France Pharmacy rose by five and a half yuan amid rumors of capital increase. Great China Matches sought luxury at high prices. Among financial stocks, Zhejiang was at 2,550 yuan, Jin Cheng at 1,550 yuan, and Jieye at 1,450 yuan, all with openings. Dalu was at 14,500 yuan with buyers. Among public utility stocks, water and electricity were at 1,250 yuan, and electricity was at 250 yuan, all at buying prices. Among real estate stocks, Yongxing rose the most strongly.</p>

<p>Government Bonds: The market was weak again yesterday, with slight rebounds that were bound to suffer setbacks. The recent stable prices have been unusual. The market sentiment is difficult to gauge. Yesterday, the initial trading of Category C bonds was stable, but it gradually declined after opening. The closing price was lower than the previous day. Categories A and B both fell, while Category E was uniquely good. The low price of medium-term bonds was due to excessively high prices in the previous days, and the high price of Category E was due to the need for spot goods. It is still nothing more than the relationship between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Business Association yesterday morning was 18%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Soap is still weak and unable to rise. Matches are sometimes firm and sometimes weak, with narrow sales channels and little price fluctuation. The path for foreign candles is increasingly large. Because the goods are claimed, the price has risen sharply, reaching the large level, and there are not many supplies, so the market is likely to rise.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Reappeared on the market, because all parties are firm on the rumors of profitability, the prices have risen consistently.</p>
<p>Food: Yesterday, the prices continued to rise, because rice merchants still use the excuse of rising production prices and difficulties in transportation, and the thicknesses are all out. The arrival of goods is interrupted, and the price will be pushed up again.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: Yesterday, because the owners are calling high, the line is firm and not rising.</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Destruction of Law and the Corruption of Morality <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Raoying</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Qingtiandong's "The Sanctity of Law" (Shen Bao Weekly Review, December 12), I had several thoughts:</p>
<p>First, in China, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present century, it seems impossible to discuss what constitutes morality and what constitutes law. Especially now, after the incident [referring to the ongoing war], it seems as if the war has broken people's hearts. Recalling before the incident, acts of violating the law and corrupting morality were done secretly by people who were despised. "Uniformed officers" did not openly collect protection fees from small vendors selling "wonton," "tofu brain," and "shoe shine," and "gangster thugs" did not transform themselves into officials. The buying and selling of official positions and the law was not done without any scruples. The war has caused unimaginable psychological changes in people. Many people seem to have immunity for doing things that destroy the law and corrupt morality, but if this continues, even those who do not take the path of petty corruption will only be destroyed along with them!</p>
<p>Second, the Japanese are very concerned about Chinese affairs, but Mr. Yoshida is truly the first person I have seen who cares about law and morality with such sincerity. I do not know Mr. Yoshida, but for this point alone, the Chinese should express their gratitude. After reading Mr. Yoshida's work, I am truly willing to serve as his follower. If morality and law cannot establish a foundation, all of the country's political, military, economic, and cultural efforts will be like building a tower on sand, and will never see real results in one's lifetime. The entire country cannot progress, and what help can it give to East Asia? This is a concern for China, and also a concern for East Asia, a concern for Japan! Therefore, regarding China's problems with morality and law, I have always advocated that Japanese people should also pay attention. For example, corruption among officials and the open operation of opium dens cannot be thoroughly resolved by the Chinese side without the assistance of the Japanese side. Now that Mr. Yoshida is so enthusiastically bringing this up, I cannot help but congratulate China. And I want to congratulate Japan even more!</p>
<p>Third, since the destruction of law and the corruption of morality are shared concerns of China and Japan, then I believe that we should work together to find a way to save the situation. Fortunately, there are precedents to follow, such as military alliances and economic cooperation, which have already been implemented. Cultural communication is also being realized step by step. In terms of morality and law, clear communication is naturally out of the question. We must not bring the practice of collecting protection fees from small vendors and grocery stores in Chinese streets, or the buying and selling of official positions, to Japan. Nor can we promote opium and gambling in Japan. However, the integrity, dedication to duty, and loyalty of Japanese officials, soldiers, police, and police can be transplanted to China, which can fundamentally save China. As for how Japan can help China in terms of morality and law, that is a very abstract question. I don't think China can also establish a "China-Japan Morality Association." But we think, if various Japanese organizations and individuals in China can pay more attention to the moral and legal issues in China, especially when interacting with Chinese people, they must pay attention to whether their Chinese friends or Chinese subordinates are involved in fraud or crime, or use themselves as a backer to commit organized and planned crimes. Japanese people's attitude towards Chinese people is that Chinese people can be let loose, while Japanese people themselves must be strictly restrained. In fact, the general attitude of Chinese people is that the crimes committed by Chinese people who are close to Japanese people, or Chinese people under the influence of Japanese people, are all recorded on the heads of Japanese people. Wouldn't this create a great injustice in history? Therefore, Japan should not have boundaries and should be determined to promote morality and law as a whole. Especially Japanese people who come to China to work must adhere to the sincerity of "being good to others" and must not be negligent in being used by Chinese villains, resulting in the unjust situation of condoning Chinese people to do evil.</p>
<p>Fourth, I have thought about the corruption of morality and law for many years, and I believe that this responsibility does not lie with the lower class, but with the upper class. If we consider the role of politics, then this responsibility should be borne by the rulers, and those outside the government cannot be held accountable. Although the decline of morality and law has been going on for a long time, it did not start today. However, those in power must bear the responsibility of reversing the decline. Throughout Chinese history, most of those in power are eager to protect their own positions. Sometimes, they even reach a critical turning point. In order to seek advancement and unwilling to retreat, they do not hesitate to personally do things that destroy the law and corrupt morality. This is the case for those in power, not to mention those outside the government. It is appropriate that the entire morality and law are declining. Regarding the rectification of this country's governance, I have long advocated that we should start with a rational organization of officials. Only with an organization can officials have guarantees, and only then can they seek progress. Otherwise, everyone will be "ruling for five days," without any assurance for the future, and it will still be a dead end. Before World War I, the corruption of officialdom in countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and France was not much different from China today. After the establishment of official organizations, they gradually progressed. Of course, the establishment of official organizations must be cautious, but the real progress of Chinese morality and law must be after the establishment of official organizations. Because officials cannot govern themselves, how can we talk about self-government for the people? Because officials cannot be democratic, how can the government talk about democracy? This is the fundamental key to national progress!</p>
<p>There are still many things that are too simple above, but I was sincerely admiring Mr. Yoshida Suoyu's article and rashly said so many careless words because of impulsion. I respectfully seek the guidance of Mr. Yoshida and other concerned parties.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>In the spring of the year when Makoto was eight years old, he entered the local Yawata Elementary School, which is the predecessor of the current Yawata National Elementary School in Yoshida.</p>
<p>"Listen to the teacher carefully!"</p>
<p>On the morning of his first day of school, his mother handed him a new towel as she said this. Because he had many older brothers, he could use their old schoolbag, skirt (worn in Japanese formal attire, translator's note), and textbooks, but the hand towel and student hat he was asking about were brand new.</p>
<p>In that place, there was no custom of mothers holding their sons' hands and sending them directly to school.</p>
<p>Makoto silently followed his older brother, Taro, who was in the third grade, through the school gate for the first time. What he liked the most was carrying his lunchbox in his schoolbag!</p>
<p>During recess, older students would wrestle. Most of the new students tremblingly played on the swings and rode on wooden horses.</p>
<p>Makoto watched the lively scene and simply smiled happily. The ruddy complexion on his pale face revealed his clean, adorable, and thin teeth. He was truly the epitome of a "handsome boy" from the local dialect.</p>
<p>"Tani's son is like an apple."</p>
<p>One of the precocious children had already captured the characteristic of Makoto's face. Children from the south do not know that apples can also be green. Makoto, with his smooth, round eyelids and rosy cheeks, did indeed look like a striking apple from a fairy tale—as if it had grown eyes and a nose.</p>
<p>"Apple! Apple!"</p>
<p>Although he was being teased, Makoto remained silent and smiled happily. From that day on, the nicknames "Apple" and "Makoto Apple" continued until the end of his adolescence.</p>
<p>However, "Apple" was not just observing the children's games. When he was invited, he gladly joined their companionship. Because he was heavy, he did not particularly like gymnastics, but he was good at wrestling. His small body did indeed have a strong will that supported him to the end. Takashi, on the other hand, was not like that. He would fall down if he was bumped from any direction.</p>
<p>"Takashi—try your best!"</p>
<p>Makoto, on the other hand, was accustomed to it and cheered him on.</p>
<p>Going to school was the most enjoyable thing. Taking a lunchbox and playing with many children—if there was any hardship, it was that the responsible teacher was particularly strict. If the homework was not done well, they would get a "chestnut shell." "Chestnut shell" meant hitting the head with knuckles, which was not very painful.</p>
<p>However, before the first graders welcomed the first New Year, because Emperor Taisho passed away, the schools all hung national flags with black ribbons and were dismissed early. (Six)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Buddhist Soup Kitchen Maintains Relief Work <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment on August 1 last year, the Shanghai Buddhist Soup Kitchen has been providing aid to more than 3,500 impoverished people. By the summer of this year, problems arose in the purchase of food and fuel, and the scope had to be reduced to 2,000 servings of porridge. However, this winter, rice and firewood are expensive, and the difficulties of the poor are even greater than in previous years. The relief work cannot be stopped, but the savings of the association are about to be exhausted. Fortunately, with the continued donations from many great philanthropists, it has been able to maintain itself until now. According to the calculation from August 1 last year to the end of November this year, the economic expenditure totaled 842,753 yuan and 8 cents. If the source is smooth, it will be expanded again. If you are willing to donate, please submit it to Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Qian Tai Bank on Sichuan Road, Jin Cheng Bank Trust Department, and the factory in Guandi Temple, Old Fourth Gate.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Please Sponsor the Foguang Sanatorium for Medical Consultations <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>The Foguang Sanatorium at 123 Lantian Road (Masinan Road) in this city was founded by Layman Ma Wenwo. It has Western and Chinese doctors in all departments, and the internal organization focuses on Buddhist education. In addition to the established outpatient department for medical consultations and medicine dispensing, an voluntary outpatient department and a spiritual treatment department have also been established. Such kindness is rare. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will spread the word widely. Also, since the cost of dispensing medicine is increasing daily, donations are welcome. Donations can be submitted to the social service department of this newspaper for collection.</p>
