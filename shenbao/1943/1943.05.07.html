<p>社評</p>
<h3>法捕房應如何處理張案</h3>
<p>昨天我們曾在短評（今日補登見第三版）中就「法律」和「人道」的觀點，指出法捕房對於張案的責任，意猶未盡，再申所見如决：</p>
<p>在討論張案之前，先將我們的立塲和態度，作一表白。第一，我們論斷事物，必須認淸本末，加以理智的和客觀的判斷；這個　斷，我們就得强調堅決，不受威脅刦持而改變。我們認爲張案的責任者是法捕房內幾個肇事的法探員和華探員，幷不是也不能牽涉到整個法捕房甚至於法租界當局的責任。如果法捕房當局不將肇事人員依法嚴辦，而有意包庇屬員犯法，那末，這個責任就從肇事人員肩上移轉到法捕房肩上。所以，我們認淸這關鍵，靜待法捕房的措置。第二，張案的重心，完全爲法律問題，自應根據法律，謀求合理之解決，絕不是外交問題，而牽涉中法間的友誼。同樣的，在法租界與法捕房當局方面，也應有此認識，要知道巿民的憤慨，並不是仇視租界與捕房當局，而是痛恨張案肇事人員的濫用刑罰。</p>
<p>我們對於張案表示莫大遺憾的，就是肇事人昌的濫施職權。這次肇事的法探員，目中輕視中國人的驕橫氣燄，是肇事的根因。他雖不能代表全體法捕房法國職員的態度，可是一般的說，大多數有這種成見，所以我們鄭重的吿訴法國友人們，輕視中國人，就是輕視法國人自己。酷毒殘忍的刑罰手段，已爲現代文明國家所不用，過去中國人民因受酷刑而殘廢而致死者，我們不能袖手不管，而更盼望今後法捕房對於用刑方式，澈底改革，使張案以及千百不知名的張案，不再重見於將來。</p>
<p>此次促成張案的肇事人員中，不幸也有若干無知無識的中國人，這種狐假虎威的幫兇者，更是遭國人共棄的敗類。我們盼望國人之服務於法捕房者，謹記着：不要超過職權的範圍，今後要爲巿民忠實服務。</p>
<p>關於張案的善後，自當依照法律解決，我們於昨日短評中，對於法捕房當局已致其忠吿，不再贅述。</p>
<p>也許有人要問，爲什麼這次張案會引起全市民如此嚴重的激憤呢？這個問題是値得提出的。我們認爲這種激憤，是法捕房與市民之間平日的不調和，尤其是曾經身受過捕房不公待遇者，更感激憤，不過藉張案爲之導發而已。我們盼望法捕房當局以張案爲轉捩，嚴戒屬員，處處與市民和衷合作，那末，極容易使市民從惡感變成好感的。</p>
<p>昨日迭接讀者紛紛來函，對於張案家屬，表示同情的慰問。並蒙上海特別巿倉庫堆棧業公會以五千元，不平市民等以四百元慨贈張案家屬，囑爲轉送，我們以十分至誠，對於讀者純粹以人類正義感的同情心，表示無限敬意。</p>
<h3>申論國家興衰之道</h3>
<p>本報前者兩論國家興衰之道，承讀者紛紛來信討論，這是很可興奮的。允蒙吉田東祐先生，特別撰文，加以闡揚，（參閱今日本報特載原文），就中國社會的特質與實際需要，而提出建立「新道德」一點，見人所不及見，言人所未言，實可感佩。我們對於這個問題，尙有加以申論的必要。</p>
<p>顧亭林先生說過：「國家興亡，匹夫有責」。這意思就是國家大事，不能只交給政府當局，而必須由每一個有志的人民，大家共同負責，因爲政府當局，無論如何賢明，然而耳目有所不周，思慮有所不及，因此人民必須拿出自己的力量，政府必須重視人民的力量，由政府與人民協力推行良好的國策與政令，才能使國家轉危爲安，由衰而興。而且，中國歷史的事實，都很明顯的記述，那一朝代或那一個統治者能得民心，那麼當時的國運必然昌隆。所以我們一再强調人民必須關心政治，同時政府允當尊重民意，以爲國家興衰之先決條件者，原因就在於此，這是一。</p>
<p>至於數十年來的政治運動，爲功爲罪，歷史家自有定論，不待我們辯解。吉田先生指出「新靑年運動」中「僅僅急於破壞舊道德，並沒有樹立替代的新道德」一點，可說是最有卓見。我們認爲，數十年來我國政治的危機，一在於廣大人民對於國家大事的漠不關心；二在於一般熱心政治者之高談闊論，只有消極的批評，沒有積極的建議；三在於當局者急功好名，文過飾非，只喜聽阿諛之詞，沒有接受批評的雅量。針對這三大危險，我們主張喚起人民關心政治，首先是建立健全的輿論。其决是設立民意機關，一方面讓人民與政府建立密切的痛癢相關的關係，另一方面使一般熱心政治者趨向於積極的救國救民之途。然而最主要的，還在於政府當局，消極方面要有採納輿論的雅量，以及不畏批判的大政治家的風度；另一方面允須言行一致，實踐新政治的道德，天下爲公，有與民更始之表現，那才是國家由衰而興的起點，這是二。</p>
<p>目前局勢之嚴重，無待再說；目前國家自振自拔的機會，更不容交臂失之。然而，我們屢决指出，中國的老百姓，不只是一向沒有說話的機會，而且也一向不許參加政治。因此歷代的興衰，其責任全由各朝統治者負之。今日中國的執政者，依舊負有國家興衰的歷史的責任，是毫無疑問的。然而，國際的環境，戰爭的演變，都不容許我們因循苟且了；「新道德」與新國民運動的前途，將決定國家民族的前途。我們站在輿論界的立塲，站在愛護國家與愛護政府的立塲，認爲對於國家興衰之道，當局有加以深長研究的必要。</p>

<p>東條首相訓辭內容</p>
<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電日本東條首相五日偕同隨員抵達此間後，六日上午出席馬尼刺各界民衆舉行之感謝日本允許獨立大會，即席發表演說，說明日本爲獲取最後勝利之決心，並重申日本允許菲島獨立之決意，鼓勵菲人以愛國爲重，竭力建設新生菲島，菲人聆聽之餘，無不深爲感動。按一國總理大臣而訪問佔領地，並直接向民衆呼籲，實爲世界史上之創舉。茲誌東條首相演辭大意如下：「諸君，余於大東亞戰爭下之今日，得有機會來此出席感謝大會，並得親聆伏爾加斯長官之名言讜論，深感欣慰。夫此次戰爭，乃我大東亞十億民衆本諸眞正之道義，爲建設大東亞之一大征戰。今我帝國陸海兩軍巳將大東亞要地悉數攻克，並加以確保，威鎮太平印度兩洋，現正從事準備，澈底擊滅敵人，余深信帝國必能打倒英美，而令彼等無力侵略東亞。時至今日，大東亞各盟邦及各民族均巳團結一致，同時十億民族亦眞正打成片，竭力爭取最後勝利，並建設新大東亞。就印度而言，印度人民亦爲吾人之同志，不久亦將與吾人團結一致。至歐洲德義及其他盟邦各國，亦均以建設世界新秩序爲共同目的向前邁進，並與吾人緊密協力，準備於不久之將來，聯合發動一大規模之攻勢。諸君，美國多年來面帶正義之假面具，從事侵略菲島無微不至，致使菲島受其慘禍。余對此深表憤慨。諸君，今菲島民衆奮起之時期業已眞正來臨，諸君應徹底排除錯誤之美國主義，而養成爲復興民族源泉之剛毅進取精神，還我大東亞民族之本來面目。更願諸君以滿腔之愛國熱誠，從事建設新生菲島。現我日本帝國對菲島之建設工作，巳作莫大之援助，將來亦復如是，故諸君之前途，誠未可限量而充滿光明。余前决在帝國第八十一屆議會席上代表帝國政府再度聲明，謂「當菲島衷心協力帝國而收獲實效時，則帝國決儘速使其獨立」此次來至此間，目睹諸君竭力建設新生菲島之情形及協力帝國之熱誠，深感欣慰，而余前此所聲明允許菲島獨立之信念，亦爲之更趨堅固。余深願諸君以今日所表現之熱誠，再接再厲，積極協助帝國完成大東亞戰爭，以菲島八百萬人民早日獲得獨立之榮譽而從速謀其實現。</p>
<p>歡宴寬上深致朂勉</p>
<p>馬尼剌六日中央社電　日東條首相六日夜設宴款待菲島行政長官伐爾加斯以决菲島行政府要員，即席致詞如次：余此次前來此間，爲期雖極短促，但親覩伐爾加斯長官閣下及各位在軍司令官閣下之指導下，一致協力傾注全力於貫澈戰爭及建設新菲島之精神及一般民衆亦孜孜操業不倦，積極向前邁進之實况，實深銘感，並致最大之敬意。予日來迭與軍政當局諸公促膝懇談，得悉伐爾加斯閣下及各位所懷之堅固決心與熱烈信念，益信此後菲島之各項施策將蒸蒸日進，誠堪與各位同慶之。余今日上午在菲島民衆感謝大會中，曾說明日本與大東亞及歐洲方面盟邦各國之團結，益趨鞏固，並披瀝日本之必勝信念，日本茲巳表明誓必擊毀美英兩國，使彼等不敢再來侵略東亞，余乘此機會再吿菲島人士，菲人能多一人早一日信賴日本，則達到菲島人之菲島時期，即可及早實現。務請今日列席之伐爾如斯閣下及各位對於此點特別理解銘記，並作更進步之協力，實深厚望焉。</p>
<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電　菲島行政長官伐爾加斯氏今晚於東條首相歡宴席上致答詞，大意謂，余對東條首相親臨菲島所予菲人之光榮，實深感激，當昭和十七年（民國三十一年）一月，菲島戰火方酣之時，東條首相即曾於日本議會中聲明日本願協助菲島獨立，菲人目覩此訊，決意益固，傾全力與日本相協力，俾能完成數百年之願望。東條首相此次訪問菲島，在菲島歷史上巳創最允榮之一頁，現菲島一千八百萬人民已與大東亞十億民族團結一致，協力於建設大東亞新秩序，以期完成光榮之共同目的。此新秩序之實現，不僅將使全亞洲民族更趨繁榮，且可更予全球人類以無限之光明及無窮之福祉。</p>
<p>首相此行意義重大</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　此間政界人士頃就東條首相訪問菲島之意義談稱，東條相前曾赴中滿兩國訪問，此次又訪問菲島，其目的在視察菲島實况，及菲島官民協助日本之誠意。此時適値我國前於第七十九，第八十一兩屆議會所聲明，允許菲島獨立即將付諸實踐之際，故其意義更屬深長。關於東條議會聲明事，菲島日軍政監部，巳提出菲島獨立實行條件三項，即（一）菲島民衆應加倍協助日本，以恢復治安；（二）應重整經濟機構，確立自給自足；（三）應恢復東亞精神等三項，而菲島上下亦能打成一片，咸以東亞共榮圈一分子之資格，協助日本？依賴日軍，並淸除過去依賴美國之錯誤觀念，遂步進行獨立準備工作。按美國前曾的定至一九四六年七月四日允許菲島獨立，作爲侵略與榨取之工具，實則乃一空頭支票，與日本之允許蜀立，實不可同日而語。蓋菲島人民必將因首相此次訪問，而深切認識日本之誠意。且美總統並未親自訪問菲島，以論討菲島獨立之可能性，其對允許菲島獨立有無誠意，於此可見。又首相此次訪問菲島，實含有訪問整個南方之意義，並昭吿世人，日本正以保衛東亞，謀世界和平爲目的，而與大東亞十億民衆團結一致，向爭取最後勝利之途勇往邁進。</p>

<p>爪加爾達六日中央社電日靑木大東亞相於本月三日在此間接見記者團時，曾談及此次視察爪哇各地之感想，大意謂，余抵爪哇後，最先感覺者，即爲目睹原住民之充分協力軍政。蓋大東亞共榮圈之建設，其最重之要素，莫如民族之協力合作，現此點已不成問題。余對爪哇之巳確立互相協力體制，允深爲欣幸。至於爪哇產業之建設狀况，亦因軍政與原住民間能互相緊密協力，故已在極順利中着着進展。又爪哇島在大東亞戰爭中，實爲南方重要根據地之一，今後深望仍根據其地位及使命，更推一步活用其自然的地位及經濟力。至於今後之產業建設，余認爲應按照建設大東亞共榮圈之遠大目光，積極以適應當地情勢而進行，最爲妥當。目下减少爪哇依存日本之程度，不僅日本產業界認爲有必要，即在爪哇方面亦最爲必要，因此實有盡量振興爪哇工業之必要。至其所需資材，當由日本供給父日本國內工廠之移駐爪哇，亦正着手研究中。余目睹爪哇民衆均能刻苦耐勞，且極勤勉工作，實不勝欽佩，關於活用人力，則應加考慮。最後余深望各人充分認識者，即日本何以有擊滅英美之力量，此實因日本國民極力减少消費生活而轉向於軍事方面，故日本對增强基礎產業及國防力巳具確信。爪哇島自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，即開始實施正式之經濟，其目的亦在將全力集中於增强戰力。深望各人均能於經營最小限度之生活以外，再傾其全力增强戰力，以完成大東亞戰爭而建設大東亞共榮圈。</p>

<h3>新任駐日大使　蔡培臨行談話</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　我新任駐日大使蔡培氏定七日下午四時由浦口乘車首途赴日履新，茲以出國在即，蔡氏特發表談話如次：余此次承派駐日大使，赴任在即，眷懷祖國，感奮殊深。今後唯有於職務上畫最大之努力，期中日邦交，益臻親密，以慰祖國父老期望之殷。自國府還都後，中日關係已進入新階段，尤其是中國參戰後，日本隨即聲明撤廢治外法權，交還專管租界，承認收回公共租界，移轉物資統制等等，並巳逐步實施，有助於我國之自主獨立者至大。其他一切對華新政策，亦無不基於平等互惠之立塲，而爲中日兩國之前途着想，曷勝慶幸。此决余赴任之後，當以本國參戰之決意，並對新東亞建設之熱誠‘儘量披瀝，於中日關係益趨緊密化。今在出國之際，不盡欲言，國民期待余於赴日後，中日邦交益臻親密，余亦期待國民之協力大東亞戰爭，益形邁進，俾有助於建設東亞共榮圈早日完成云。</p>
<h3>郝鵬謁汪主席</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　蘇淮特別區行政長官郝鵬於日前來京述職，六日下午五時恭謁　汪主席致敬，報吿蘇淮特區現在一般政治狀况，預定七日乘車返任。</p>
<h3>日軍在「渝第三軍分區」搜獲大量軍需糧秣</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　據京漢路沿綫某地電，日軍於猛攻渝（第在軍分區）時，除竭力搜索潛匿渝軍外，並曾截獲渝軍隱匿大批軍需糧秣等，蓋該處渝軍於此次作戰以前，即曾積藏大量糧秣。又渝軍在冀西區根據地，第四軍分區前衛據點，第三軍分區中擁有多數軍械廠地雷製造廠及火藥庫等，經日軍此次作戰，巳將其糧秣軍械儲藏施設激底覆滅，僅四日一日中，被日軍覆滅之軍械廠巳達十八所以上，而日軍在北大悲附近截獲之白米總數即達數萬公斤，此次可知渝第三軍分區在過去三年內搜括之苛。此外又在各處發現藏匿鋼鐵石油紙等數量甚多，亦均爲日軍截獲，渝軍喪失此項大量糧秣軍需資材後，其不能重立（第三軍分區）乃爲勢所必然云。</p>
<p>太行山區日軍戰果　南京六日中央社雷日軍部隊自四月二十日發動太行山作戰後，現仍繼續進行攻擊中，自作戰開始以來，至五月三日止，巳查明之戰果如左：（包括巳發表者）渝軍遺屍五七五七，被俘九六八三，日軍截獲步槍四八七一，輕機槍二九四，重機槍四〇，迫擊砲十六，山砲六十六。</p>
<h3>改進斂容制度　開首次審委會</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　司法行政部爲實施擴大檢察制度，同時以各院監所看守法警激底改革之必要，經設立改進檢察制度編練法警看守委員會，以便商酌進行。茲聞該委負會巳於日昨召集各委員舉行首决會議，由主任委員陳羣主席，決　要案多起，關於改進檢察制兩案均巳商定原則，或具體辦法，一俟呈奉核准，即可照案辦理，擴大檢察制度，行見逐步開展。</p>
<h3>鄂敎廳長謁主席</h3>

<h3>如阜匪共　陸世良投誠</h3>
<p>南通六日中央社電　自淸鄕工作展開後，匪共內部大起動搖，且其下級幹部皆感到抗戰非計，多有傾向和平之意。須悉如皐匪共所設馬塘西南鄕偽主任陸世良率部向我軍投誠，業已開始協助淸鄉。</p>
<h3>重光外相續接見各國使節</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日重光外相於六日接見駐日之瑞典西班牙丹麥阿當汗瑞士各國公使，並於明日繼續接見葡萄牙匈牙利保加利亞各國公使，七日再分別接見各國駐日代理大使中華民國土耳其阿根廷及羅馬尼亞代理公使。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日重光外相自本月四日起曾先後分別接見駐日六國大使及九國公使，按日外相之分別接見各國駐日使節，並作長時間會談，尙屬罕見，故頗爲各方所注目。據此間外交界人士意見，認重光外相之意，欲先與各國駐日使節取得緊密連繫，造成更友好之空氣，故此實爲重光外交之穩妥礎石。當重光外相於就任之初，卽首先闡明其外交政策，曾謂國家之總力政策，足以反映於外交方面，而自然決定其輪廓，故帝國外交之根本方針，應以完成大東亞建設及軸心之世界新秩序爲目標而展開。抑重光外相特別重視外交政策之一貫性，故在表面上亦特別注意避免予外交上非一貫之印象。當此日本於任何方面業已確立超越敵人之絕對優勢之時，重光外相亦以其穩重態度接見各國使節，就日本與各國之現實關係重加檢討，而日本國民亦均能一致擁護其政府之外交政策，凡此事實均爲前所未有，故重光外相之愼重從事，亦即爲在强力推進總力戰中之外交戰，以整備其靜中取動之態勢。</p>
<h3>英美在渥太華　簽訂海軍協定</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社海軍特派員宜稱：英美最近在加拿大渥太華地方簽訂之海軍協定，實具有秘密條約之特徵，惟有若干極可注意之點，巳爲人所共知，對於兩國間之關係，有意義重大之顯示。此協定最重要之條款，無疑係將維持橫渡大西洋供應路綫之責任，加諸英國及加拿大。第一，因英母國所需之重要接濟，全部由此路綫運輸；第二，因所經過之海面，爲全世界最危險之區域；是以此協定條款之意義，不啻規定英國須自行保護其三分之一之商船。倘使吾人對德潛艇之擊沉商船數字加以考慮，將可預計至一九四三年底時，反軸心方面在本年被擊沉之船舶恐不下六百萬噸，其中美方不過佔一小部份而已。英國與加拿大各船廠在此時期內所能造成之商船，決不能超過六十萬噸已無可諱言，英國船舶噸位之不斷减縮，巳迅速喪失其世界强大商業國家之地位。吾人至此，或不免發生一種疑問，以爲美國商船旣未遭受重大打擊，何以不於接濟食料軍火之外，再負起運輸此項貨物亚沿涂保護之責任。就常情論，公允之合夥辦法，必由强者自負最艱難工作，而任弱者擔負輕微之責任，但美國此次與英締結渥太華協定，其動機並不爲此，因據此協定所規定，美國所擔任者反爲無何危險之南太平洋各路綫，此項協定又可證實英國早巳感覺之疑懼不爲無因，即美國將頗有爲其本身經濟願望而犧牲英國商務利益之傾向也。</p>
<h3>智利商船讓與英美</h3>
<p>阿京六日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社消息，軸心國潛艇戰，邇來奇形活躍，英美商船受損殊巨，新建之船殊嫌不足應需要，以故華盛頓與倫敦方面正壓迫南美各國出讓其所有運輸船隻，例如智利巳被迫出讓其最精良之商船三艘，英國並將接收智利龐大浮碼頭一所，而送往澳洲備用。然智利代表人史密脫門竟敢提出抗議，並巳請求李奧斯總統暫停此種不利於智利一般經濟之賣買。</p>
<h3>美英蘇三國領袖　傳將舉行會議　羅斯福派特使赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　此間民族報昨日預言，羅斯福總統邱吉爾首相及斯達林將舉行會商，並謂在何處舉行，將完全由史太林一人定奪。華盛頓半官方面認爲羅斯福總統所欲與斯達林討論者以軍事問題爲主云。一</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電據路透社華盛頓電，傳美總統羅斯福之特使台維斯，巳於五日自美出發，搭機飛赴莫斯科。反軸心國爲打開蘇波紛爭，除英美蘇三國首腦會談外，別無他策。</p>

<h3>突尼西亞軸心軍　決心堅守沿海要塞　英美軍分三路作扇形推進　泰布巴將成未來大戰中心</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電海通社軍事特派員宜稱，星期二突尼西亞西北前綫祇有局部戰事，反軸心軍於攻佔瑪蒂爾之後，現派斥堠隊向德義軍新陣地探索前進，反軸心軍之未來意向，目前仍難明瞭。現抵地中海與阿克爾湖西北岸間地峽之法殖民地部隊，巳由美軍增援，惟由此事實是否即可判斷英美方面決心在沿海岸作集中行動，以攻佔比塞大，尙屬疑問。更南之地區中，有美第二軍團之先頭部隊由瑪蒂爾分三路作扇形推進，第一路向東北推進，攻擊阿克爾與比塞大兩湖間之渡頭村；第二路向東推進，以傑貝爾凱基勃塔爲目的，因由突尼斯至比塞大之兩公路均在具控制之下；第三路則向東南前進，以泰布巴爲目標。反軸心指揮部究將集中其主要攻勢於何處，仍難斷言。如其目的係欲分裂德義前綫爲兩截，則將須攻佔傑貝爾凱基勃塔，蓋其地不僅爲堅强防禦陣地，且其位置係在比塞大砲台外圍堡壘綫之範圍內，反軸心軍欲進攻該地，自需相當兵力。現美軍確已由安德森將軍之處獲得相當雄厚之增援，惟集中於瑪蒂爾區之英美軍，是否確具三路進攻之充分力量，仍成問題。誠如上述，美軍最高司令之決定如何，殊難逆料，但就形勢判斷，如其選擇進攻泰布巴之一路似比較便宜，因在該處有與英第一軍中路合作之可能性也。星期二英第一軍曾屢决猛攻梅傑茲埃爾巴勃東北之德陣地，並有若干地方一度被其攻入，但經德軍反攻後即予擊退。反軸心軍在該區所加之壓力，暗示戰事有繼續增劇之可能，是以泰布巴四周區域，或將在未來戰事中佔重要地位，亦未可知。其他方面前綫殊無要事可報，祗有法叛軍進攻彭杜法斯已被擊退，及反軸心軍在南綫之砲火活動更見猛烈兩事，尙有一提之價値。</p>
<h3>墨索里尼演說　深信必獲最後勝利</h3>
<p>羅馬六日中央社電據斯蒂芬尼社訊：義相墨索里尼昨日在維尼齊亞宮之陽台上，作簡短之演說，重申義大利之堅決作戰到底，以獲最後勝利，並謂義人必將重返非洲。新任法西斯黨秘咨斯科柴在維尼齊亞宮舉行招待，由各省高級黨務領袖參與後，民衆即羣集宮前，高呼義相出見，及義相出臨陽台後，彼等即要求義相致辭，義相當即首肯，演說時民衆屢决歡呼，義相宜稱：「諸君之呼聲，似充有不可毀滅信仰與最高之信心。信仰法西斯主義，信賴當今困難時期之犧牲，必能獲得最後勝利，倘如上帝乃公平的，而義大利亦係永存者。九年以前本人嘗在此陽台上論及非洲遠征戰役之完畢及義大利帝國之建立，今此一發展並未結束，不過爲片刻之休息而已。余深知千萬之義人·皆對於所謂非洲疾患者感受無限痛苦·吾人唯有一法以治之，即返回是，吾人必將返回。現時絕對必要者，爲尊崇戰時輕視懦夫及槍殺賣國賊，不問其係屬於任何階級任何種族，此不僅爲余個人之私意，想諸君與義大利全國亦必具同一之意見。」</p>
<h3>凱威廉少將繼任　駐歐美軍司令</h3>

<p>里斯本六日中央社電據倫敦來電，美歐洲派遣軍司令部四日會發表謂：駐歐美軍司令安德魯中將三日在冰島因飛機失事，業巳遭難，茲又於五日補充發表謂，該軍參謀長鮑特少將亦巳與安德魯中將同時遭難。</p>
<h3>東綫庫彭區　德軍改善陣地　德遠射砲猛轟列寗城</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　有資格方面昨日宣稱：蘇軍在過去數日間，向庫彭橋頭堡之德軍陣地攻擊，蒙受重大之損失後，已暫時弛緩其攻擊。德軍於五月四日晨巳撤離克里姆斯加雅鎭，蘇軍並未發覺德軍之撤退準備，故德軍撒離診鎭及其北面及南面之鄰接地區時，並未受敵軍之阻撓。撤離之陣地係向東面深入，形成一突出地區，此種突出地區，極不利於防守，故決定撤離之克里姆斯加雅西之德軍新陣地則極利於防守，蓋其後方有崇山峻嶺爲之掩護。據海通社軍事特派員稱：克里姆斯加雅之撤退，自軍事上觀之絕無重要，自戰略上觀之，蘇軍亦未能有任何利益，蓋該鎭位於平原，而德軍之新陣地則在該處西面之山嶺斜坡。同時德軍之陣綫亦已大　縮短，故德軍之實力亦必大爲增加。德軍如將其後備加入作戰，則不難固守該鎭，並奪回蘇軍於星期一在該鎭東南所獲之陣地，但德軍並不出此，蓋此舉將得不償失，且有違於德軍節省實力以備更重大之作戰。依照現時之情况，德軍之能順利保守庫彭橋頭堡，亦可保證戰鬥現時雖巳緩弛，但蘇軍之攻勢或將繼續。</p>

<h3>國家興衰之道</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>最近的申報社評，曾經接連二次，論述中國的「國家興衰之道」。結論說：「政府機構中每一個公務人員，從最高領袖到下級幹部，人人都要做全國人民的模範，樹立廉潔整肅的政治風氣。」某一個日要人看了這社評，說是像這種道學的抽象論，到底不能解決南京政府所遭遇的困難的問題。中庸裏有這樣一句話：「道不遠人，人之爲道而遠人，不可以爲道。」筆者相信唯有實行這誰都明白之道德的提案，才是眞正的中國的國家興衰之道。在說明其理山以前，先有一述中國所具若　的特殊性的必要。</p>
<p>大家都知道，在歐洲，國家（政府）與敎會是個別的機關。大　敎會所負的責任是人民的道德而國家（政府）所負的責任是社會秩序的維持。至於中國，則在這二方面的責任都是由國家担負的。在歐洲，道德的淵源是神；在中國，道德的淵源是國家。更具體的說，就是從最高領袖到下級幹部的公務員的行動。在中國佛敎是一向不得管理活人的道德的，在現在說來，也只能管死者的市民證；儒敎則早已埋沒於塵土，現亦僅止於常爲好事奢流引其所好的文句而巳。中國即使在佛敎儒敎盛行的時代，爲道而殉死者極尠，但如文天祥等，爲國家而以身殉者蓋夥焉。因此，在中國如其幽民對國家的最高領袖而失却尊敬，則其國民道德，沒有不急激地退化的。所謂「上行下效」，要以在道德上指示這種關係者。而此處的所謂「上」，卽係指國家的最高領袖及其以下的官吏。在中國要做官，必須通過三次關於古典與古詩方面的嚴格考試，通過這試騐而成爲「秀才」「舉人」「進士」之後，始許授以官職。縱令這種考試　度看來像是怎樣地可笑，但從官吏是國民道德的溯源這中國的特殊性看來，却是極有意義的制度。因爲要想通過這種考試，便不能不熟讀萬卷古籍，此以在此期問，官吏乃親身經受道德與文化的敎養，因此靠着這種考試制度，中國的學者官僚，得長爲中國國民道德的砥柱。學者官僚在今日革命的中國，縱如何被視爲滑稽化，但賴他們所具的敎養與道德，以維特國民道德的功績，我們實不能一筆抹殺。</p>
<p>辛亥革命推翻了淸朝的政權，同時，指導淸朝的國民道德的學者官僚們，也從政府中被驅逐出去。結果，中國的國民道德不得不出現了可怖的無政府狀態。可代替舊道德的新道德，還沒有建設起來。因此，舊道德雖然巳經天去了它的砥柱，但其殿宇尙未至於崩坍，依舊還是一座空屋而殘存着。民國四年的新靑年運動，首先從這　道德的大殿宇破壞工作開始。他們新青年社的態度，在民國八年發表的「新青年罪案答辯書」中闡釋如决：</p>
<p>「他們所非難本誌的，無非是破壞孔敎，破壞禮法，破壞國粹，破壞貞節，破壞舊倫理（忠孝節），破壞舊藝術（中國劇），破壞舊示敎（鬼神），破壞舊文學，破壞舊政治（特權人治），這幾條罪案。這幾條罪案，本社同人當然直認不諱。但是追本溯源，本誌同人，本來無罪。只因爲擁護那德莫克拉西（Democracy）和賽因斯（Science）二位先生，才犯了這幾條滔天大罪。要擁護那德先生，便不得不反對那孔敎，禮法，貞節，舊倫理，舊政治。要擁護那賽先生，便不得不反對那國粹和舊文學」。</p>
<p>這裏也可以知道新靑年運動祇急於破壞舊道德，一點也沒有涉及替代的新道德的構造，所以那運動不僅沒有成功把那舊道德所留下的殿宇的工作，加以完全的破壞，甚至速其自身也並沒有完成了新國民道德的構想圖。結果，侵入這空屋的，却是從上海的英美人所輪入的哥德稱爲「盎格魯撤克遜之病的文化」（Anglo-Saxon　Contagion）一九一二年出版的「中國的牛津運動」（The　Story　of　aChinese　Oxford　Movement　by　Ku　Hung-Ming，April，1912．辜鴻銘著）中說：</p>
<p>「上海的外國人，說新中國在袁世凱之下剪掉了辮髮，採用歐羅巴文化，而極欣喜，這些誤解的人們一點也不明瞭新中國所採用的文化，決不是歐羅巴文明，祇是上海的歐羅巴文明－那是哥德所說的盎格魯撤克遜之病的文化。眞正的歐羅巴文明的疾病，現正在中國發展着」。（見原書二十二頁）</p>
<p>這話對現代的上海，不，中國，是怎樣的適切，讀者自身可以耳聞目睹，母須喋喋。此時此地有的是盎格魯撒克遜文化，但已非它的本來面目，而是上海製的英美墮落文化。這種文化，旣非道德的管理者之宗敎，亦非社會秩序的管理者之國家。所有的是金錢的道德，金錢的社會秩序。金錢的所有者是道德的決定者，也就是爲政者，是宋子文和孔祥熙的世界。他們怎樣造成今日的財產，此地也不想多說，在他們發財的背後，不知有幾千個破產者在街頭奄奄待斃，也不知有幾萬個善良的農夫，爲了高利貸而被剝奪了土地。然而他們却是這社會上所謂模範的紳士，昂首闊步。這種紳士最近迄未絕跡。二三年之前，尙是街頭的「癟三」，曾幾何時，巳積聚了數千萬的財產，他們之中，甚至有莫名其正業爲何者。然而人們對其財產的來源，恬不爲異，祇當他們是「發財老爺」而待以新士之禮。在這種道德中，賭博被認爲「高尙的娛樂」，賭博的塲所當然也成爲紳士的俱樂部。在戰時經濟下，一般的家庭都在節的電氣，街道上自晚上八時左右起，燈火均已晤滅，工廠亦因節的電力而被迫縮短工作，然而這些俱樂部却能够徹夜通明的點着煌煌電燈而「通宵營業」。在這種道德中，社會上有地位的人，雖競事囤積，鴉片鬼做了高官，昏昏迷迷而審理案件，人們都不敢責怪。這就是「盎格魯撒克遜之病的文化」的現實，孔子曾說：「免而無恥」，上海，不，中國今日的道德，眞所謂免而無恥的道德。</p>
<p>今日南京政府的當前任務，端在把這墮落文化從中國驅逐出去，而建設孫文先生所欲行而不能行的三民主義道德。這運動的推進力，在中國旣不是儒敎，也不是佛敎，乃是最高領袖以下政府機構中各成員的行動。正如學者官僚之爲舊道德的支持者，新官僚亦不能不成爲新道德的砥柱。每一個官僚小能不具有「做全國人民的模範，樹立廉潔整肅的政治風氣」的熱誠。然而事實上政府公務員中絕對不犯「盎格魯撒克遜之病的文化」的人，不能斷言其沒有。在主席所發起的新國民運動，因此緣故而具有重大的意義。　　汪主席在國府還都三週年紀念日發表「吿全國國民書」，共中把新國民運動定義如决</p>
<p>「百年以來，我們同胞，受英美政治的壓迫，軍事的侵奪，經濟的剝削，這些都是有形的，而文化的麻醉，使我們同胞，在思想方面，不知不覺忘記了自己，這些無形的荼毒，較有形的，厲害何止萬倍。我們要打倒英美的勢力，先要肅淸了各人胸中的英美思想，這是我們從事大東亞戰爭的第要務，、也就是總力戰戰的第要着。怎樣纔能肅消呢？要打倒別人，先要建立自己，新國民運動，便是所以建立自己的」。</p>
<p>汪主席在這裏所說的自己建設的運動，當必就是對盎格魯撒克遜文化即上海文化的革命，並且也就是中國固有文化，特別是新中國的道德建設運動吧。</p>
<p>汪主席說：「盎格魯撒克遜文化的麻醉，是無形的荼毒，較之有形的，厲害何止萬倍」，實是至言。唯筆者謹在這裏獻言，新國民運動，應首先從肅淸有形的害毒開始。囤積，抽雅片，賭博等完全是盎格魯撒克遜文化的產物。新國民運動首先肅淸了這些「有形的荼毒」之後，此後的發展可以格外容易。假使「有形的荼毒」不能解決，則解決「無形的荼毒」，其困難何止萬倍。然而作爲實際問題看來，即此有形荼毒的解決，在新國民運動之前，亦正困難重重。要克服這困難，僅賴政府的努力還是不够，民間的知識階級不能不首先嚮應，援助政府。假使政府的公務員，每人有做人民模範的信念，不被困難屈服，把社會上的荼毒一個一個肅淸起來，則和平地區的知識　級，雖所不欲，亦將自動來支持政府吧。</p>
<p>重慶方面的知識階級，如其見到中國的積害一個一個被新國民運動肅淸，也必將來參加和平陣營吧！這樣的新道德的勝利，正是全面和平的基礎條件。（五月三日。翔：譯）</p>

<p>檢斷鑑定傷重身死　查死者張金海，現年十九歲，原籍鎭江，業商，量得身長六十四英寸，膀闊十四英寸，胸高七·五英寸。</p>
<p>外表檢查　面色淡黃，全身色淡黃，全身營養佳良，口部有泡沫流出，鼻孔亦有微量水液流出，左頭部頭皮腫脹，周圍二英寸，左籲顯部皮膚有暗紫色，皮下溢血斑痕一處，周圍三公分，左胸肋部前側皮膚有暗紫色，皮下溢血斑痕五處：計雙角大四處，銀圓大一處，左手腕關節背側處有紅色壓痕兩處，均黃豆大小，左右兩手背輕度浮腫，其餘各部均無損傷異狀。</p>
<p>內部檢查　頭腔開檢：照式將頭部切開剝離，見左頭部與左顳顬部皮下均有溢血斑痕大小部位，與外表所見均同，頭骨無，骨折鋸斷，頭骨腦部無出血與其他受傷現象，胸腹腔開檢：胸及腹部之皮膚沿正中綫加以切開，胸腔臟器均無異狀，亦無出血現象，但在左側前胸肋部皮下出血著明廣大，自第二肋骨至第八肋骨均有出血斑痕，鋸斷肋骨，則前胸左側肋膜亦有出血斑痕，亦自第二肋骨至第八肋骨腹腔內儲有大量紫紅色血液，係內臟出血之明徵，當檢得肝臟業巳破裂，並有多量凝血，其餘各　臟器，均無異狀。</p>
<p>檢斷說明　在頭部與左顳部之傷痕，乃由鈍器打擊所致，　兩傷難認，爲於致命上有直接之關係，左前胸肋部之傷痕亦由鈍器打擊，　腹腔內脾臟破裂，此可由於胸肋部之內外傷卽出血斑痕斷定之，左手腕關節之傷痕與左右手背之浮腫，似係繩索鐐銬等緊壓所致，均不致命，是以鑑定本屍委係胸肋部受外來之鈍器打擊，致脾臟破裂與脾臟出血身死。</p>
<p>特二法院嚴重抗議　檢騐張金海屍體之論斷，旣委由生前受傷身死，特二地方法院院長陳秉鈞及首席橡察官沈文傑，爲維護法權，保障市民法益起見，當即向法租界行政當局口頭提出嚴重抗議，要求秉公懲處法藉兇犯米雷外，復迅將參加非刑逼供之華探朱松成等立即解送該院依法嚴懲。</p>
<p>羅部長特專程來滬　自張案發生後，司法行政部部長羅君强氏得悉，備極重視，特專程由京來滬，密切注意該案之發展，特二法院並將檢騐屍體之論斷及交涉經過，一併備文送呈羅部長察核，並有所請訓指示機宜。</p>
<p>訴狀　本案業巳由死者家屬王式向該管特二法院提起控訴，茲將其上訴原文誌後，</p>

<p>李翻譯　西探廿三號</p>
<p>汪樹　米來</p>
<p>爲誣良　吞遺失物非刑殺人訴求　法治罪事，竊吿訴人之獨子金海，係兩房合嗣，新在菜巿路二九二號成記衫襪廠供職，律已極嚴，從未犯罪，四月二十八日午後，第一被吿李姓女向職員康萬卿購貨百餘元，翌晨來，以昨日購貨時有無洗衣憑條遺失在此相詢，當由店主張月波親自細查未見，據實以吿而去，未幾第一被吿竟夥同藝華洗衣店主第二被吿郭士元職員第三被吿馮金生及華探第四被吿朱松成蜂擁來店，聲勢汹汹，由馮金生擅指學徒彭雙龍似曾持票取衣，遂由第四被吿將彭君拘入捕房，即由該華探及第五被吿李翻課共同以棍痛擊，逼招口供，繼囚他室，由第六被吿西探二十三號冉施重刑，彭君無法熬受，乃誣供吿訴人之子金海（曾於地下拾得一紙，是否即此，則不知之。）等語，於是由探員朱松成將吿訴人之子金海拘入捕房，先由被吿朱松成西探二十三號及李翻譯汪樹等四人輪流施以重刑，一再拷打，此時第二被吿郭士元向以上四被吿謂（他是老門檻，非做出口供來不可。）繼又以法語敎唆第八被吿西探米來拖入另一小室，於是再由以上四探（即朱李在外人二十三號）共同以酷刑拷打，至奄奄一息之際，復由西探米來親自動手，施行慘無人道之極刑，此時店主張月波候在外室，初尙聽見呼天搶地之悲號慘音，時斷時續，未數分鏡竟聲息全無，但聞探捕切切私語，謂（姓張的已做壞了。）而店主月波此時尙未明悉究竟，旋在探及郭士元向張月波謂（汝暫且回去明日解公堂。）豈知次日吿訴人之子金海已被米來等五人非刑拷打身死。除屍體巳呈經鈞院檢察處騐明肋骨自第二根至第八根全部重傷，太陽穴及腦壳亦受重傷，腹內充滿汚血，腹內脾部全部破碎等語，塡明屍單附卷。伏查李女會吾遺失洗衣憑條，巳有可疑，該第一被吿李姓女及第二被吿馮金生何得空中樓閣，誣良侵吞，敎唆包探，逼招口供，其始已存有不良動機，而結果終至造成慘案，雖非直接殺人，但虛構事實，聽憑包探拷打逼供，以使他人受刑事處分，　屬觸犯刑法第一六九條之罪。决偵查機關拘詢人民，須有法律上之根據，若有犯罪嫌疑，亦應於二十四小時內移解法院審訊，退而言之，縱使金海侵吞遺物屬實，按刑亦不過科罰而巳，今該包探米來朱松成汪樹李翻譯及西探二十三號等，非不明知係一非常輕微案件，而竟不惜輪流施用慘無人道之非刑，雖至奄奄一息之際，尙不罷手，足徵其最初目的，巳萌殺人之意，卒至吿訴人之子，因不堪受刑而慘遭死亡。至於米來，爲最後一脚踢死金海之主犯，均已分別　犯同法一二五條三十條及二百七十一條凟職段人”幫助殺人罪從重處斷。再查被吿郭士元，係主使西探米來等嚴刑拷打吿訴人之子當塲身亡，犯同法二十九條及二百七十一條敎唆殺人罪，允應處以重刑。總之，上開探員身負警衛地方治安之重責，在此光天化日之下，竟敢憑　租界關係，非刑拷打無辜良民，橫行不法，暗無天日，若不立即拘案，分別依照上開條文之最高本刑，治以應得之罪，非惟寃沉海底，永難昭　，且恐此後類此之案效允發生，人民生命，無法保障，爲此具狀，懇請鈞院鑒核，准予偵查，並吿處被吿等以　得之罪，以彰國法，實爲德感。謹狀上海第二特區地方法院檢察處。</p>
<p>法領法庭復傳偵訊　法國總領事署經警務總監要求，因辣斐誠記襪衫廠　徒張金海慘死法警務署內一案，業巳命令領事法庭庭長予以詳細偵查，所有可以作證之人員，均行停止工作，據聞昨法領事法庭曾傳集偵訊，並將受傷學徒彭雙龍於廣慈醫院中傳召訊部。</p>

<h3>第二期　憑房捐票購油　今日起實行　每人四兩價五元一角　辦法與首期完全相同</h3>
<p>本市第二期憑房捐票計口購油，仍由食油批發處呈准軍配當局，配發五百噸，業經由該處將各項手續辦竣。於今（七）日起公共租界憑冬季房捐票及戶長市民證，法租界憑一二月份房捐票及戶長身份證，滬西閘北區憑戶籍證及戶長居住證於每日上午九時至下午五時，向指定油店購買，辦法與上期完全相同。</p>
<p>售油日期十七截止　至於數量，仍爲每人四兩，惟售價須依照新價每斤二十元零四角計算，四兩食油爲五元一角。同時該處對是項食油之配給，係依照保甲當局調查之人數計算，故市民儘可於限期內向指定零售油店購買應得數量，無庸爭先恐後，而發生紊亂狀態。且各零售油店，須依照定章儘量發售，絕對不得藉詞拒，或有尅扣斤量等情事發生。否則市民儘可檢舉，當由該處予以取銷零售權，幷報吿警務當局，依法究辦，至售油截止日期，爲本月十七日。</p>
<p>南市區域手續未竣　南巿區域，因手續上尙禾完全辦竣，故未配與兩租界同時出售，須緩遲數日，的於本月十日，亦可實行。其數量及價格等，與兩租界相同。</p>
<h3>本月計口授糖十一日起普售</h3>
<p>上海區糖業同業公會成立後，對本市食糖之配給事宜，仍由糖商合作營業處繼續辦理。而各甲乙種零售商，亦經規定入會，仍負責出售，本月份之計口授糖，業由該處辦理配給中，內定本月十一日起開始普售，各零售糖店於接得該處通知後，即須辦理繳款提貨手續，以便如期實施。至於數量仍每人四兩，售價二元三角半，如包裝者須另出包裝費用。</p>
<p>特種配給陸續辦理　又對各業務上需用之特種配給糖，巳由該處繼續審查辦理，惟因戶頭浩繁，故採取陸續配給辦法，隨時審竣，隨時配給，各業商店接得該處通知後，即須依照限期繳款提貨，且絕對不得有轉賣情事，否則當予停止配給。</p>
<h3>計口授糧制度業已確產堅固</h3>
<p>本埠自實行計口授糧制度以來，對於民食，裨益甚大，近因黑市米價之下跌，市上會傳當局將停止實施計口授給制之說，絕對不確。蓋當局對於計口授糧之制度，業巳確立堅固，決無中途停止之可能。</p>
<p>將儘可能增加配給　計口授給之食糧，當局將儘可能予以增加，並將著重於普遍的一般居民之配給，爲使均等配給起見，米糧辦事處業已於本期起，將額外配給米，由每期二升，减至每期一升。同時以停配麵製食品業之麵粉，轉移配給與一般居民，以盡可能增加麵粉之配給量。</p>
<p>滬西戶糧今起發售　滬西區第十二期戶口米，共計四千五百包，業經滬西區公糶辦公處分配就緒，准定於今日起開始發售，聞此期戶口米，因有上期存米之抵補，故每人可購整米二升，共計洋陸元。</p>

<h3>張金海寃死與法捕房的責任</h3>
<p>連日各報刋載邵葆三谷儒文兩律師代表張元吉君呼籲啟事，事實是這樣的：一個十九歲的靑年，鎭江人張金海君，不幸以莫須有的寃枉，死於法捕房幾個探員的酷刑之下。這一案件，撼動整個上海社會，震驚每個巿民心弦，揭發了人類正義的共鳴。</p>
<p>我們先從法律觀點而言，張金海縱有犯罪行爲，法捕房廳當於問話之後，在二十四小時以內，移送法院，依法公訴，聽受法律處辦。乃法捕房　不及移送法院，而先用酷刑，以至於慘死，這個責仟，自當由法捕房肇事人員負之。</p>
<p>再從人道觀　而言，張金海的犯罪，充其極也不過「冒領大衣」，何至於用重刑，我們憑常識推斷，十九歲的靑年，是正在發育時候，體力强壯，受刑致死，無疑是極酷辣的極不人道的刑罰。</p>
<p>法捕房是一個執法機關，用刑罰是幾個執法人員，今執法人員因濫用職權而變成犯法人員，那末，法捕房爲維持整個執法機關的尊嚴，必須速將犯法人員絕對處之於法，坦白認過，吿罪於社會；一面爲寃死者料理善後，優卹無辜，這纔是法捕房賢明的應有的措置。如果庇護屬員犯法，而澳視人類正義，勢將招致不幸的後果，順逆之道，願法捕房當局鄭重抉擇。</p>
<p>我們竭誠盼望捕房當局，切戒屬員，改善刑法，「若欲人不知，除非已莫爲。」這是中國的古諺，謹以贈諸法捕房全體人昌，悉心體會。（補登）</p>
<h3>日陸軍報道部　招待記者　談渝美空軍狀況</h3>
<p>日本在上海陸軍部報道部昨日下午三時，於招待本市中國新聞記者團常會席上，日發言人發表美在渝空軍，及渝軍目前之狀况，並謂渝美雖有企圖蠢動，絕對難以作對日進擊之夢想。</p>
<p>美渝空軍　日發言人首述在渝之美空軍最主要之一貫目標，乃企圖對日蠢動，擬在台灣九州一帶有所舉動，在目前狀態，以建甌·桂林·零陵·衡陽等四處之前進根據地作準備加强補充，故日機在四月廿五·廿六·廿七等日，空襲零陵及雲南驛，擊滅敵機四十餘架，我人當獲勝利後，雖確信美在渝空軍難以報復，但亦須縝密防備，此次美在渝司令長官史蒂威爾，及美第十四航空部隊捷諾　返美晋謁羅斯福，其目的雖未見發表，我人可斷定不外强化在渝實力，及作戰之方針。然美在渝之空軍，迄今不但毫無發展，且隨時有遭日空軍威脅之可能。繼述美在渝空軍</p>
<p>僵局難解　　核實天關渝空軍妄想蠢動，勢必與渝空軍合作，但渝美雙方意見紛歧，此項僵局，斷難打開，更難聯合對日作戰，同時日本之防空準備，防空訓練，及空軍生產，無時不在突飛猛晋中，且最新式之戰鬥機，產量旣多，戚力更龐大，一切的一切，均有充分之力量。故美之企圖，當難以實現，如一旦蠢動全　常有覆滅之虞，故在渝美空軍空言宣傳，難求發揮實力，最近　慶氣候，爲日空軍利用空襲之良機，在今後當更可活躍攻擊，而渝方則尙朦然未知危機即在眉睫。</p>
<p>渝軍力量　最後述及渝軍力量，渝軍因未得伸展，故目　　充實本身之戰鬥力，此可預料日軍終有攻佔內地之一日，不得不作凖備及補充軍需，渝大部軍需，向依賴外國，由頃甸綫輸入，但因運輸困難，彈　及一切軍需迄難如願，且內對外路綫　絕，內部交通之不便，更受日軍空襲戚脅，前綫士氣頹喪，即令充實，亦難得效果，故美渝空軍，殊難對日作進攻之舉舉。</p>
<h3>第四期捲煙派貨　增加數額　採累進新制比例派貨將公佈未限價烟價目</h3>
<p>華中烟草配給組合，爲充分配給捲烟，以維巿上正當　要起見，第四期派貨。已予實行增加　給額。以前係依照甲乙丙丁四級制，按一·二·三·四比例派貨，今巳改爲一·二·四·八新制派貨。例如此决丁卡派額，數値二千五百元，丙卡爲五千元，乙卡爲一萬元，甲種則爲二萬元，所派之貨，包括軍管理願中烟公司。日商中華烟公司·華商·華成·南洋·大東·福新等廠出品。自五日起，通知卸賣商及小賣商繳款，向指定之配給所及大同行提貨，預定十五日以前完全辦竣。至於其他各烟廠出品，凡第一次所公佈之限價未列入者，頃經該組合呈請當局核准，限價即將公佈。關於上海近郊批發商登哥已竣，將實施配給，華中其他各地配給，業巳開始，捲烟價格完全一律，所以此後轉販牟利之風，勢必遏止。至於執行捲烟限價問題，該組合巳派督察昌認眞督查，絕對禁止囤積轉販，以及拒售等不法行盛。</p>
<h3>鄭午昌師生畫展　—選件義實助學—</h3>

<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>限明繳納所得稅　財政部所得稅處上海區征收局，以二十九年及三十年度之第一類營利事業所得稅，尙有一部份商號迄今遲延未繳者，該局爲整頓稅收計，特限期本月底前一律須將所得稅額申報完齊，如再逾限不報，即行依照條例實行處罰。</p>
<p>滬粵滙票恢復　上海與粵省曾經戰事各地之匯兌，滬郵政管理局，巳予恢復。惟須審核其是否爲正當用度，每一張匯票之限額，以五十元爲度，手續非常簡便，至浙東各地，如蕭山·寗紹·鎭海·餘姚·慈谿·各地之匯兌，上海郵政管理局正在向杭州浙江郵政管理局商洽，共謀恢復。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>限價捲煙</h3>
<p>「到處不見限價烟！」這差不多今日上海每一個巿民所習聞習見的現實。最近幾天，因爲第四期捲烟配給的時期又到，本欄承蒙讀者公衆紛紛投寄關於戢滅捲烟黑市的文字，雖因限於篇幅，一時朱及披露，可是，公衆對於限價捲烟的輿論，由此得使我們集了一個大成。</p>
<p>誠爲大家所說的，幾個月前軋米軋糖的作風，如今變爲軋烟了。可是，整個限價捲烟巿塲中最惡劣的現象，不是「軋烟」，而是「藏」；烟的來踪甚顯，而烟的去跡不明——因爲限價烟都歸到黑市裏邊去了。結果，限價捲烟，徒成捲烟黑市的倉庫。這當然是配給當局所未嘗預料的。</p>
<p>關於戢滅捲烟黑市的對策，各方所貢獻的意見很多，例如有的主張，在配給方面，利用保甲制度，實施捲烟計口配給，有如授米，授糖，授油的辦法；有的主張，在偵香方面，進行更嚴密的組織，有如最近電車公司所派出的便衣查票；有的中張，在處罰方而，永久停止配而外，並須將捲烟門售商店負責人，送交主管官署究辦，有如員前滬西兩家捲烟店主人所遭受的處罰；有的主張，在檢舉方面，授公衆以檢舉控吿全權，向配給組合或就近官署檢舉，並與報社合作，俾資公佈，有如取締投機囤積的一樣嚴重。</p>
<p>這些辦法，在原則上，顯然是充分合理的；可是，行動重於言詞，這些辦法－－或是其他同樣有效辦法－－的如何實施，與何時實施，乃爲捲烟配給當局的職責所在，而不是消費者的公衆所能爲力的。</p>
<h3>嚴格管理行荘業務　規定運用存款資金　實施檢查各行莊營業狀况</h3>
<p>財政部爲嚴格管理各銀行錢莊業務起見，除飭繳解定期活期存款準備金外，由中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處，實施檢查各行莊資產·負債·以及營業狀况，並規定：（一）金融機關因淸結債務，而承受担保品時，不問其爲動產（證券除外）或不動產，應於一年內處分之。（二）在管理金融機關辦法施行前，巳營法令以外業務者，應於該辦法施行細則施行後一年以內，結束診項業務。</p>
<p>規定運用存款資金　至於經營儲蓄業務之行莊，運用儲蓄資金規定。（一）對於農村合作社之質押放款，及以農產物爲質之放款，不得少於存款總額五分之一。（二）以繼續有確實收益之不動產爲抵押放款，不得超過其存款總額五分之一。（三）他銀行定期存單或存　爲質之放款，不得超過其存款總額十五分之一。（四）購入他銀行承兌之票據，不得超過其存款總額二十分之一。（五）存放於他銀行，不得超過其存款總額十五分之一。（六）購入政府債券，及以有價證券爲質之放款，不得超過已繳資本及公積金總額十分之一。</p>
<h3>中儲木村顧問　執行各報社記者　發表充實中儲內容問題</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行顧問木村增太郞氏爲表明中央儲備銀行力謀張化之內容，使人民得有更深切之認識特於前（五）日下午三時在該行滬分行三樓招待中國各報社記者，舉行懇談，希望各界協力完成國民經濟使命，茲節錄要點如下：略謂銀行在民生方面，關係甚鉅，責任非常重大，因中央儲備銀行，是政府銀行，關係民生，更爲重大，現在欲安定通貨，必須强化中央儲備銀行，使民衆對中儲有深切之信仰，其强化中儲要點：（一）使發行儲券準備金充足，（二）放款愼重，外傳謠言中儲無準備金，實多錯誤，中儲發行儲券，早經確定充分準備金，中儲放款目標，非銀行者絕對不放，卽係銀行，亦必須審查確實後，方可放出，最近物價高漲，一般不認識現時情形，都認爲係通貨發行所致，其實目前之物價高漲，乃在於物資本身之缺乏，故欲抑平物價，須從充實物資來源着手，中央儲備銀行，充實內容，是必須各方協力，必須民衆理解，才能促成通貨安定云云。</p>

<p>本市各業工廠經當局協助，刻已决第開工生產，情形甚爲良好，並所需原料，亦克充分獲得，昨據煤業界消息，此因各業工廠均經開工生產，故烟煤用途似見激增，幸是項燃料，皆由當局按期配給。頗無匱乏之虞，並其巿價低廉，裨益製造成本匪淺，同時當局對於各廠所需之烟煤，亦在積極採辦中，俾能大量運滬儲積。</p>

<h3>立志篇</h3>
<p>— 爭榮</p>
<p>古人說：「人窮志小窮。」這句話的確有深刻的意義。人窮，非終身窮，故不可以恥之，更小可辱之。有一般人，家道豪富，往往看人眼低，當窮人命如螻蟻，再有一般人，對上詔容奉承，對下狐假虎威，其實自己也是一副窮骨頭，猩猩尙知惜猩猩，而人類何獨不然耶？焉知窮人祇要志不窮，平生宏志未圖，忍氣受辱，時時牢記在心頭，一且平地一聲雷，往往使若輩羞慚得無地自容呢？終於令人敬之頌之。</p>
<p>倘若，人窮志亦窮，那纔是終身窮，他的人生，是一個死的人生，換句話說：他可以不必到地球上來受苦。因爲他的歷稈，祇是黑暗，祇有痛苦，他的一生，就永遠得不到光明，被人類所唾棄，也可以說他是人　中多餘的，還是快設法向死的歸途去。</p>
<p>所以，立志是人生的要則，是成功的原動力，一個人不可以不立志，其原理即在於斯。</p>
<h3>上海雜記（三）</h3>
<p>— 橋本關雪</p>
<p>鑑於日本在古代與外國交流之頻盛，可知中國在古代與外國交流之範圍史爲廣遠。我曾說，中國在漢代季年，巳有外國文化移入，移流民不是在更古的時代巳經浸染了外國文化嗎？明治時代，大江山所說明酒顚童子是雜有俄羅斯血液的人，傳說他喜歡飲血，其實所謂飲血者大概是葡萄酒吧！這些說法都不能一笑置之。即就其地理的關係說來，也頗妥當。我所以這樣說，並不是附和大江山的說法，譬如武陵桃源故事，係被所謂西部亞細亞人暴秦所被逐而逃避者，這不一定是率强附會的傳說。陶淵明的桃花源記，今不能背誦，祇記得有「男女衣着，悉如外人，黃髮垂髫」數語。所謂黃髮垂髫者，並不單是形容蓬頭不加梳洗的意思，並可作黃色的頭髮解。現在六朝唐代的發掘品中，人家部知道常有黃髮的土偶發見。</p>
<p>湖南人的容貌，即在今日也與普通的中國人不同。鼻高，眼大，性情精悍，在古代遂沃土而居，好勇鬥狠。（上面漏說了；李太白人們都說他是隴西人，但近來也有人說他是鮮卑，即西伯利亞人。）就地理的關係說來，從四川省溯揚子江而下，桃源（在湖南省，近常德，）恰是適官的定居之地。去年末，三千年來桃源夢境　的記述，也許一古腦兒被吹走了。我可以結論說，以中華民國作胚胎的汛亞細亞人，在新　文化的創造上，在二千年前巳有前事之鑑了。我想這決不是無理的問題。</p>
<p>中國事變之後的第四年，大東亞戰發生。中國人對日本人的感情，爲之一新，洵屬可喜。日本語熱的盛行，在南方更可以深切地感覺到。我想日木語即將成爲大東亞語而普及各地。尤其在中國，文字的近似，是便利的原因之一，另一原因，可說是由於功利的思想，如其懂日本語，可以很快的獲得職業。火車中，酒菜館中，日本語雖尙未十分普及，但意思大概可以傳達了。不過我覺得我喜歡到中國來的那種情趣，似乎漸漸地在减少着，從列車中見到在窗外菜花中從事耕種的農夫們的藍色衣服，立刻就想到迄完全是中國風味。</p>
<p>我向同行的錢君問：一那許多水牛怎樣了，如何沒有看見？」錢君答道：「都吃光了。」回到家裏，談起此事，女人們都大笑起來，「無綫電中講笑話的說水牛有一股水臭。」我也曾想過，或者不至如此。可是，這不是笑話。在上海，一面如新開酒菜館等，如雨後春筍，比以前增加很多，僱傭了美麗活潑的女侍，無論那家都極熱閙。而另一面，物資父似乎很感到缺乏。周鍊霞女史有上海即事詩一首形容這情况。</p>
<p>描寫因買米而在街上等待很長久的情形，這詩現在頗爲上海一部詩人所愛誦。還有一二首，會刊於週刋朝日，茲從略。隨便那裏，從有知識人們的口中，常可以聽到理解日本，信賴日本的言論。這是很可喜的現象。</p>
<p>一諸位很疲倦了，不久就到〇〇。」</p>
<p>這是火車中的中國車長所說的話。其中並有日本語比我講得還要正確的女侍們。（四月十日）（翔：譯自四月二十三日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>同情</h3>
<p>— 士林</p>
<p>同情是把他人的苦痛如實在自己心裏反映了而生的感情。我們相信：人類社會一切的隔離，衝突，禍害，都可以用同情來救濟的。世間儘有不能體會他人的苦痛的人，甚至於還有反對的以他人的苦痛爲快樂的人。惟共如此，於是世間遂充滿着禍患了。小而家庭的勃谿，大而社會的不安，人種的仇視，都是因爲沒有同情的緣故。孔子的所謂「仁」，釋迦的所謂「慈悲」，耶穌的所許「博愛」，那一種不是以同情爲基礎？</p>
<p>凡是有同情的人，都能原恕他人。竊盜，在頑固的道德家看來，原是可以深惡痛疾的；但是竊盜也有竊盜的原因，或者由於貧窮，或者由於不受敎育，或者由於遺傳和伴侶，或着由於整個社會的不安定。如果把他所以會做竊盜的原因一加體察，覺得竊盜雖惡，着實有可以悲憫同情的地方，不能單是用了淺薄的道德的見解一味深惡痛疾的了。可是原恕他人，是同情的消極的方面，同情還有積極的方面。有同情的人不但能原恕世間的罪惡，還能造成功德，排除世間的罪惡。因爲同情於現在婦女和勞動者的地位不良，所以要提倡社會改造；因爲問情於鄕民無知的苦痛，所以要努力於普及敎育。同情不但能愛好人人的，還有能憎惡人的同情，孔子晚的：「惟仁者能愛人，能惡人。」像那般投機囤積之徒，激刺物價飛漲，危害民生安定。爲要撲滅這種毒　，社會上要有破除情面的作風，政府中更要有大義滅親的精神，嚴刑奸頑，儆傷有衆。因爲富於同情的人，本來是爲「最大多數的最大幸福」設想的！這些都可以說是積極的同情心的表現。</p>
<p>我國國民，一向被家挨觀念所束縛，結果把同情限小了範圍，於家族以外，缺乏了相互結合的能力知道德。在我國除了家族及與家族有密切關係的親戚，所有的就是所謂「外人」了。在這彼此相「外」的國民中，當然沒有社會的團結可言，非大大的把同情的範圍擴張不可！</p>
<h3>談習慣</h3>
<p>— 步建</p>
<p>「習慣」彷彿是最平常習俗的事，因之，往往最易被大多人們忽略蔑視。它不但有好和惡的分別，並且還帶有積極的意義，能直接影饗人生的事業成敗。</p>
<p>賭博，逛妓，酗酒，癖烟，……是不良的惡習慣：它能誘惑人趨向消沉，潦倒，頹廢，墮落，……不但貽害人敗家蕩產，傷損健康，並且還會破裂人情，葬送前程。那巳是人人皆知的。</p>
<p>反過來，好的習慣，也正是成事達業的一個優良條件，如早起，飲食的制，便溺定時……它是有益健康。好讀勤學，它能增進知識和積極促成事業。愼言和睦，它能使廣交友朋，濃密情誼……</p>
<p>但是不顧是好的和惡的習慣，它的形成，決不是偶然，都是有緣由的；也不是一時的惡的習慣，大致多是貪求一時趣味和淫樂，無意識地造成的。好的習慣，興味愛好固也是一個原因，大致多還是有意識的養成。因之，每初習時，往往感到無限困難和痛苦，但日久却成自然——習慣化·那時</p>
<h3>慾望</h3>
<p>— 張雲夫</p>
<p>慾望和人生是有着密切的關係。只要一個人一生下來，慾望也就跟着而來，所以世界上決不會有個一點沒有慾望的人。因爲凡是一個人，若要想生活下去，終要有種種衣食等物質需要，有了這些物質上的須要，就得轉念頭，動腦肋起來。無論是垂死的老頭兒，就是剛出母胎的嬰孩的啼哭聲；據心理學家研究的結果，也是一種慾望的表現，更不論是貧窮的人，有種種物質上的愁望，連那些在囤積居奇後發了財的大腹賈，也依然要轉金錢的念頭，甚至連自以爲淸心寡慾的出家人，也有妄想在天堂上享樂的慾念。所以千言萬語，總而言之，一個人死了便罷，倘若不死終有各種慾望來纏繞着你。</p>
<p>人類的慾望，因着各人環境不同的關係，也各有差別。但這無窮的慾望，往往會產生了不良後果。</p>
<p>慾望雖能造成種種惡果，然而在另一方面，它也有種種益處。人類若沒有了慾望，就不能進步。也只要有了慾望，才能克服一切困難的遭遇。</p>
<h3>魔鬼</h3>
<p>— 許政敭</p>
<p>牠戴着慈善的新面具，穿着道德的舊衣裳；並且常常搖着頭嘆氣：</p>
<p>「嗚呼！嗚呼！世風日下，人心不古！」</p>
<p>於是，許多人就跪着，向牠膜拜，祝福，謳歌……</p>
<p>之後，牠便除下了面具，脫去了衣裳，把許多向牠屈膝的人們抓過來，一脚踏住，抽其筋，剝其皮，在吸其血，爛嚼其肉，許多人都呻吟着，直至變成許多髑髏爲止。</p>
<p>他終於又把衣裳面具重行穿戴起來；並且在面具上畫一個哭喪着的所謂「慈悲臉，」然後望着這些髑髏悲憫地嘆道。</p>
<p>「嗚呼哀哉！嗚呼痛哉！」</p>
<p>於是，許多髑麒就跪着，向他膜拜，祝福，謳歌，並感謝……</p>

<h3>How the French Concession Police Should Handle the Zhang Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in our short commentary (supplemented today on page three), from the perspectives of "law" and "humanity," we pointed out the responsibility of the French Concession Police in the Zhang case. Feeling that we had not fully expressed our views, we further clarify our opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Before discussing the Zhang case, let us first state our position and attitude. First, when judging matters, we must recognize the fundamentals and secondary aspects and make rational and objective judgments. Once this judgment is made, we must emphasize firmness and not be swayed or coerced into changing it. We believe that the responsible parties in the Zhang case are a few of the French and Chinese detectives within the French Concession Police who caused the incident. It is neither the responsibility of the entire French Concession Police nor even the French Concession authorities. If the French Concession authorities do not severely punish the perpetrators according to the law but intentionally protect subordinates who have broken the law, then this responsibility will shift from the perpetrators to the French Concession Police. Therefore, we recognize this key point and await the measures taken by the French Concession Police. Second, the core of the Zhang case is entirely a legal issue and should be resolved reasonably based on the law. It is absolutely not a diplomatic issue involving Sino-French friendship. Similarly, the French Concession and the French Concession Police authorities should also recognize this. They must understand that the public's anger is not directed at the concession and the police authorities but rather at the abuse of punishment by the perpetrators in the Zhang case.</p>
<p>What we deeply regret about the Zhang case is the abuse of authority by the perpetrators. The arrogance and contempt for Chinese people shown by the French detective who caused the incident is the root cause of the incident. Although he cannot represent the attitude of all French officers in the French Concession Police, generally speaking, most of them have this prejudice. Therefore, we solemnly tell our French friends that despising Chinese people is the same as despising the French themselves. Cruel and inhumane methods of punishment are no longer used by modern civilized nations. We cannot stand idly by when Chinese people have been crippled or killed by torture in the past. We further hope that the French Concession Police will thoroughly reform their methods of punishment in the future so that the Zhang case and thousands of unnamed Zhang cases will not be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, among the perpetrators who contributed to the Zhang case, there were also some ignorant and uneducated Chinese people. These accomplices who abuse their power are even more despised by the nation. We hope that Chinese people serving in the French Concession Police will remember: do not exceed the scope of your authority, and in the future, serve the citizens faithfully.</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the Zhang case, it should be resolved according to the law. In our short commentary yesterday, we already gave our sincere advice to the French Concession Police authorities, so we will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will ask, why did this Zhang case cause such serious public outrage? This question is worth raising. We believe that this outrage stems from the usual disharmony between the French Concession Police and the citizens, especially those who have personally experienced unfair treatment by the police. However, it is merely vented through the Zhang case. We hope that the French Concession Police authorities will take the Zhang case as a turning point, strictly discipline their subordinates, and cooperate harmoniously with the citizens in all matters. Then, it will be very easy to turn the public's negative feelings into positive ones.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received numerous letters from readers expressing sympathy and condolences to the family of the Zhang case. Furthermore, we have received generous donations of five thousand yuan from the Shanghai Special Municipal Warehouse and Stacking Industry Association and four hundred yuan from outraged citizens for the family of the Zhang case, entrusted to us for forwarding. We express our infinite respect for the readers' purely humanitarian sympathy.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Way to National Prosperity</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has previously published two articles on the way to national prosperity, which have been followed by numerous letters from readers for discussion, which is very encouraging. Mr. Yoshida Toyu has kindly written a special article to elaborate on this (see the original article featured in today's newspaper), focusing on establishing a "new morality" based on the characteristics and practical needs of Chinese society, providing insights that others have not seen and expressing ideas that others have not spoken, which is truly admirable. We still need to further discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Gu Tinglin said: "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual." This means that national affairs cannot be left solely to the government authorities but must be jointly shouldered by every patriotic citizen. Because no matter how wise the government authorities may be, their eyes and ears are limited, and their thoughts may not be comprehensive. Therefore, the people must contribute their strength, and the government must value the strength of the people. Only when the government and the people work together to implement good national policies and decrees can the nation turn from danger to safety and from decline to prosperity. Moreover, the facts of Chinese history clearly record that the dynasty or ruler who wins the hearts of the people will inevitably experience prosperity in the nation's fortunes at that time. Therefore, we repeatedly emphasize that the people must be concerned about politics, and at the same time, the government should respect public opinion as a prerequisite for the rise and fall of the nation. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>As for the political movements of the past few decades, historians will have their own conclusions on their merits and demerits, which we do not need to argue. Mr. Yoshida pointed out that the "New Youth Movement" was "only eager to destroy the old morality and did not establish a new morality to replace it," which can be said to be the most insightful observation. We believe that the crises in our country's politics over the past few decades are threefold: first, the vast majority of the people are indifferent to national affairs; second, the high-sounding rhetoric of those who are enthusiastic about politics only consists of negative criticisms and lacks positive suggestions; and third, the authorities are eager for quick success and instant benefits, concealing their faults and embellishing their errors, only liking to hear flattering words and not having the magnanimity to accept criticism. In response to these three major dangers, we advocate arousing the people's concern for politics, and the first step is to establish sound public opinion. The solution is to establish a people's opinion agency, on the one hand, to establish a close and painful relationship between the people and the government, and on the other hand, to guide those who are enthusiastic about politics towards the path of actively saving the country and the people. However, the most important thing is still the government authorities. On the negative side, they must have the magnanimity to adopt public opinion and the demeanor of a great politician who is not afraid of criticism; on the other hand, they must be consistent in their words and deeds, practice the morality of new politics, regard the world as the common good, and demonstrate a fresh start with the people. That is the starting point for the nation to rise from decline to prosperity. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the current situation need not be repeated; the current opportunity for the nation to revive itself must not be missed. However, we have repeatedly pointed out that the Chinese people have not only never had the opportunity to speak but have also never been allowed to participate in politics. Therefore, the responsibility for the rise and fall of dynasties throughout history rests entirely with the rulers of each dynasty. Today's rulers of China undoubtedly bear the historical responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. However, the international environment and the evolution of the war do not allow us to be complacent and procrastinate. The future of the "new morality" and the new national movement will determine the future of the nation and the people. Standing in the position of the public opinion circle and in the position of loving the country and loving the government, we believe that the authorities need to conduct in-depth research on the way to national prosperity.</p>

The main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech are recorded as follows: "Gentlemen, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to attend this conference of thanks today during the Greater East Asia War and to hear the famous and straightforward words of Chief Executive Vargas. This war is a great campaign for the construction of Greater East Asia by the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia based on true morality. Now, our imperial army and navy have conquered and secured all the important places in Greater East Asia, and they are preparing to thoroughly destroy the enemy, and I am convinced that the empire will defeat Britain and the United States and make them unable to invade East Asia. Today, all the allied nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have united as one, and 1 billion ethnic groups have truly become one, striving for final victory and building a new Greater East Asia. As far as India is concerned, the Indian people are also our comrades, and they will soon unite with us. As for Germany, Italy, and other allied countries in Europe, they are also moving forward with the common goal of building a new world order, and they are closely cooperating with us, preparing to launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. Gentlemen, the United States has been wearing a mask of justice for many years, engaging in meticulous aggression against the Philippines, causing the Philippines to suffer. I am deeply indignant about this. Gentlemen, the time has truly come for the Filipino people to rise up. You should thoroughly eliminate the erroneous Americanism and cultivate the tough and enterprising spirit that is the source of national revival, and restore the original face of our Greater East Asian nations. I also hope that you will devote yourselves to the construction of a new Philippines with full patriotic enthusiasm. Our Japanese Empire has already provided great assistance to the construction of the Philippines, and it will continue to do so in the future, so your future is truly limitless and full of light. I have previously stated once again on behalf of the imperial government at the 81st session of the Imperial Diet that "when the Philippines sincerely cooperates with the Empire and achieves practical results, the Empire will make it independent as soon as possible." Coming here this time and witnessing your efforts to build a new Philippines and your enthusiasm for cooperating with the Empire, I am deeply gratified, and my belief that I have previously declared the permission for Philippine independence has become even stronger. I sincerely hope that you will take advantage of the enthusiasm you have shown today and continue to actively assist the Empire in completing the Greater East Asia War, so that the 8 million people of the Philippines can obtain the honor of independence as soon as possible and seek its realization."</p>
<p>Banquet Extends Deep Encouragement</p>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet on the night of the 6th to entertain Philippine Chief Executive Vargas and other dignitaries of the Philippine government, and delivered a speech on the spot as follows: Although my visit here this time is very short, I am deeply moved and pay the utmost respect to Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else for your spirit of unanimously cooperating under the guidance of the commander of the military commander to devote all your efforts to implementing the war and building a new Philippines, and to the general public for their tireless work and active progress. I have had frequent and frank discussions with the military and political authorities in recent days, and I have learned that Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else have a firm determination and enthusiastic belief, and I believe that the various policies of the Philippines will improve steadily in the future, and I am truly happy to congratulate everyone. This morning, at the Philippine People's Thanksgiving Conference, I explained that Japan and the allied nations of Greater East Asia and Europe are becoming more and more united, and I have revealed Japan's belief in victory. Japan has now declared that it will destroy the United States and Britain, so that they dare not invade East Asia again. I take this opportunity to tell the Filipino people that the sooner one more Filipino trusts Japan, the sooner the period of the Philippines for the Filipino people can be realized. I hope that Chief Executive Vargas and everyone else who are present today will especially understand and remember this point and cooperate even more, and I have deep hopes for this.</p>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Philippine Chief Executive Vargas delivered a reply at the banquet of Prime Minister Tojo tonight, saying that he was deeply grateful for the honor given to the Filipino people by Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines. When the flames of war were raging in the Philippines in January of Showa 17 (1942), Prime Minister Tojo had declared in the Japanese Diet that Japan was willing to assist the Philippines in its independence. The Filipino people witnessed this news and their determination to cooperate with Japan with all their strength was strengthened, so that they could complete their centuries-old desire. Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines has created one of the most glorious pages in Philippine history. Now, 18 million Filipino people have united with the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in building a new order in Greater East Asia, so as to achieve a glorious common goal. The realization of this new order will not only make all Asian nations more prosperous, but also give all mankind infinite light and endless well-being.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Visit of Great Significance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Political figures here have recently commented on the significance of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines, saying that Prime Minister Tojo had previously visited China and Manchuria, and this time he visited the Philippines to inspect the actual situation in the Philippines and the sincerity of Philippine officials and people in assisting Japan. At this time, it is when the declaration that our country made at the 79th and 81st sessions of the Diet will be put into practice, so its significance is even more profound. Regarding the matter of Tojo's Diet statement, the Japanese Military Administration Department in the Philippines has proposed three conditions for the implementation of Philippine independence, namely (1) the Filipino people should assist Japan more to restore law and order; (2) the economic structure should be reorganized to establish self-sufficiency; (3) the East Asian spirit should be restored, etc. The Philippines has also been able to unite as one, and they are all assisting Japan with the qualifications of a member of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere? Relying on the Japanese army and eliminating the past erroneous concept of relying on the United States, they have been preparing for independence step by step. The United States had previously set July 4, 1946, as the date for allowing the Philippines to become independent, as a tool for aggression and exploitation, which was actually an empty check, which cannot be compared with Japan's permission for independence. The Filipino people will definitely deeply recognize Japan's sincerity because of the Prime Minister's visit. The US President has not personally visited the Philippines to discuss the possibility of Philippine independence. It can be seen from this whether he is sincere in allowing the Philippines to become independent. The Prime Minister's visit to the Philippines contains the meaning of visiting the entire South, and it also tells the world that Japan is uniting with the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia for the purpose of defending East Asia and seeking world peace, and is marching forward courageously on the road to striving for final victory.</p>
<h3>Minister Aoki Publishes Impressions of Visiting Java</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Java Military Administration Department announced on the 6th that Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki flew to Jakarta at 10:30 AM on the 2nd. He immediately visited the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force at the Military Administration Department, listened to the report on the military administration situation by Military Administrator Okazaki, and inspected the Bogor Botanical Garden, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and other places. After completing his affairs, he flew to a certain place by plane on the 6th. Surabaya, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki arrived safely in Surabaya at noon on the 4th. In the afternoon, he visited the commander of a certain naval unit and Governor Anoka, and inspected the shipbuilding operations at the Port of Surabaya after its restoration. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, he took a plane to Malang and stayed in Solo on the same day. He left Malang on the morning of the 6th for his destination.</p>
<p>Jakarta, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki talked about his impressions of visiting various parts of Java when he met with a group of reporters here on the 3rd of this month, saying that the first thing he felt after arriving in Java was to witness the full cooperation of the aborigines in the military administration. The most important element in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the cooperation and cooperation of ethnic groups, and this point is no longer a problem. I am very pleased with the mutually cooperative system that has been established in Java. As for the construction of Java's industry, it has also been progressing smoothly due to the close cooperation between the military administration and the aborigines. Java Island is an important base in the South in the Greater East Asia War, and I hope that it will continue to make full use of its natural position and economic strength based on its position and mission. As for future industrial construction, I think it should be carried out in accordance with the grand vision of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and actively adapting to the local situation. At present, reducing Java's dependence on Japan is not only necessary for the Japanese industry, but also most necessary in Java, so it is necessary to vigorously revitalize Java's industry as much as possible. The materials needed will be supplied by Japan, and the relocation of Japanese domestic factories to Java is also being studied. I am very impressed that the people of Java are able to endure hardship and work diligently. Consideration should be given to making use of manpower. Finally, I hope that everyone will fully recognize why Japan has the power to destroy the United States and Britain. This is because the Japanese people have tried their best to reduce their consumption and turn to the military, so Japan has confidence in strengthening its basic industries and national defense. Java Island has begun to implement a formal economy since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its purpose is also to concentrate all its efforts on strengthening its combat capabilities. I hope that everyone will be able to devote all their efforts to strengthening their combat capabilities in addition to living within the minimum necessary life, so as to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, Speaks Before Departure</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Our newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Pei, is scheduled to depart from Pukou by train at 4:00 PM on the 7th to take up his new post in Japan. As he is about to leave the country, Mr. Cai has issued the following statement: "I am deeply honored and inspired to be appointed as the Ambassador to Japan. In the future, I will devote my utmost efforts to my duties, hoping to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan, in order to fulfill the ardent expectations of the elders in my motherland. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage. Especially after China's participation in the war, Japan immediately declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concession territories under exclusive control, the recognition of the recovery of public concessions, and the transfer of material control, etc., and has gradually implemented them, which is of great help to China's independence and autonomy. All other new policies towards China are based on equality and mutual benefit, and are intended for the future of both China and Japan, which is gratifying. Therefore, after I take office, I will fully express my determination to participate in the war and my enthusiasm for the construction of a new East Asia, so that Sino-Japanese relations will become closer. As I am about to leave the country, I have much to say. The people expect me to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan after I arrive in Japan. I also expect the people to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and make further progress, so as to help complete the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Hao Peng Visits Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Hao Peng, the Administrative Commissioner of the Su-Huai Special District, came to Nanjing a few days ago to report on his duties. At 5:00 PM on the 6th, he respectfully visited Chairman Wang to pay his respects and report on the general political situation in the Su-Huai Special District. He is scheduled to return to his post by train on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Seizes Large Quantities of Military Supplies and Provisions in "Chongqing Third Military District"</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from a certain place along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, when the Japanese army fiercely attacked Chongqing (Third Military District), in addition to making every effort to search for hidden Chongqing soldiers, they also intercepted a large number of military supplies, provisions, etc. hidden by the Chongqing army. Before the operation, the Chongqing army had already accumulated a large amount of provisions. In addition, the Chongqing army's base areas in the western Hebei region, the vanguard strongholds of the Fourth Military District, and the Third Military District all had a large number of ordnance factories, landmine manufacturing factories, and ammunition depots. Through this operation by the Japanese army, the facilities for storing provisions and ordnance have been completely destroyed. On the 1st alone, the number of ordnance factories destroyed by the Japanese army reached more than eighteen. The total amount of rice intercepted by the Japanese army near Beidabei reached tens of thousands of kilograms. From this, it can be seen how harsh the Chongqing Third Military District was in the past three years. In addition, a large amount of hidden steel, oil, paper, etc. were discovered in various places, all of which were intercepted by the Japanese army. After losing this large amount of provisions and military supplies, it is inevitable that the Chongqing army will not be able to re-establish (the Third Military District).</p>
<p>War Results of the Japanese Army in the Taihang Mountains: Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency Lei: Since the Japanese army launched the Taihang Mountain operation on April 20th, it has continued its attacks. Since the beginning of the operation until May 3rd, the war results that have been verified are as follows: (including those already announced) 5,757 corpses of the Chongqing army, 9,683 prisoners, 4,871 rifles seized by the Japanese army, 294 light machine guns, 40 heavy machine guns, 16 mortars, and 66 mountain guns.</p>
<h3>Improving the Procuratorial System: First Review Committee Meeting Held</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: In order to implement the expanded procuratorial system and to thoroughly reform the guards and bailiffs in various courts, prisons, and detention centers, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has established a committee to improve the procuratorial system and train bailiffs and guards, in order to discuss and implement the plan. It is reported that the committee held its first meeting of all members yesterday, chaired by Director Chen Qun. Many important cases were decided. The principles or specific measures for improving the procuratorial system in both cases have been agreed upon. Once approved, they can be implemented accordingly. The expanded procuratorial system will be gradually developed.</p>
<h3>Governor of Hubei Education Visits the Chairman</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, officials and civilians in Hubei presented 1.5 million yuan in national currency for national defense donations, and appointed Huang Dazhong, the Director of the Education Department of the province, as their representative to come to Nanjing to present the donation. It is learned that Director Huang is scheduled to respectfully visit the Chairman this morning to pay his respects and present the donation in person.</p>
<h3>Lu Shiliang, a Bandit and Communist in Rugao, Surrenders</h3>
<p>Nantong, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Since the launch of the Clear Countryside campaign, there has been great turmoil within the bandits and communists, and their lower-level cadres have all felt that resistance is not a good plan, and many have shown a tendency towards peace. It is necessary to know that Lu Shiliang, the pseudo-director of the Matang Southwest Township established by the bandits and communists in Rugao, led his troops to surrender to our army and has already begun to assist in clearing the countryside.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Continues to Receive Envoys from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu received the envoys from Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Afghanistan, and Switzerland stationed in Japan on the 6th, and will continue to receive the envoys from Portugal, Hungary, and Bulgaria tomorrow. On the 7th, he will receive the chargés d'affaires from various countries, including the Republic of China, Turkey, Argentina, and Romania.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has successively received ambassadors from six countries and envoys from nine countries stationed in Japan since the 4th of this month. It is rare for the Japanese Foreign Minister to receive envoys from various countries separately and hold long talks, so it has attracted much attention from all parties. According to opinions from diplomatic circles here, it is believed that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu intends to first establish close ties with the envoys of various countries stationed in Japan in order to create a more friendly atmosphere. Therefore, this is actually a solid foundation for Shigemitsu's diplomacy. When Foreign Minister Shigemitsu first took office, he first clarified his diplomatic policy, saying that the national general power policy can be reflected in the diplomatic aspect, and naturally determine its outline. Therefore, the fundamental policy of imperial diplomacy should be developed with the goal of completing the construction of Greater East Asia and the new world order of the Axis powers. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu particularly values the consistency of diplomatic policy, so he also pays special attention to avoiding giving the impression of non-consistency in diplomacy on the surface. At a time when Japan has established an absolute advantage over its enemies in all aspects, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is also meeting with envoys from various countries with a calm attitude, re-examining the actual relationship between Japan and various countries. The Japanese people are also unanimously supporting their government's diplomatic policy. All these facts are unprecedented, so Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's prudent approach is also a diplomatic war in the forceful promotion of the total war, in order to prepare for a state of calmness to seize opportunities.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Sign a Naval Agreement in Ottawa</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: A naval correspondent for the Overseas News Agency declares: The naval agreement recently signed by Britain and the United States in Ottawa, Canada, has the characteristics of a secret treaty, but some very noteworthy points are already known to the public, which has a significant indication of the relationship between the two countries. The most important clause of this agreement undoubtedly places the responsibility of maintaining the supply route across the Atlantic Ocean on Britain and Canada. First, because all the important supplies needed by the British motherland are transported along this route; second, because the sea area it passes through is the most dangerous area in the world; therefore, the meaning of this agreement clause is equivalent to stipulating that Britain must protect one-third of its own merchant ships. If we consider the number of merchant ships sunk by German submarines, it can be predicted that by the end of 1943, the number of ships sunk by the anti-Axis powers this year will probably be no less than six million tons, of which the United States will only account for a small part. It is undeniable that the number of merchant ships that British and Canadian shipyards can build during this period will not exceed 600,000 tons. The continuous reduction of British ship tonnage has rapidly lost its position as a world-powerful commercial nation. At this point, we may inevitably raise a question, since American merchant ships have not suffered major blows, why not take on the responsibility of transporting and protecting these goods in addition to supplying food and ammunition. According to common sense, a fair partnership method must be that the stronger bears the most difficult work, and the weaker bears the minor responsibility. However, the motive for the United States' conclusion of the Ottawa Agreement with Britain this time is not for this reason, because according to the provisions of this agreement, what the United States undertakes is the non-dangerous South Pacific routes. This agreement also confirms the concerns that Britain has long felt are not without reason, that is, the United States will tend to sacrifice British commercial interests for its own economic desires.</p>
<h3>Chilean Merchant Ships Ceded to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Aijing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: Stefani News Agency reports that the Axis submarine war has been surprisingly active recently, and British and American merchant ships have suffered huge losses. The newly built ships are far from enough to meet the needs. Therefore, Washington and London are pressuring South American countries to cede all their transport ships. For example, Chile has been forced to cede its three best merchant ships, and Britain will also take over a huge Chilean floating dock and send it to Australia for use. However, Chilean representative Smithton dared to protest and has requested President Rios to suspend such sales that are detrimental to Chile's general economy.</p>
<h3>Leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Reportedly to Hold a Meeting; Roosevelt Sends Special Envoy to Moscow</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 6th Central News Agency dispatch: The local "Nation Daily" predicted yesterday that President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Stalin will hold consultations, and said that the location of the meeting will be decided entirely by Stalin alone. Semi-official sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt wants to discuss military issues with Stalin as the main focus.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, it is reported that President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, departed from the United States on the 5th and flew to Moscow. Apart from a summit meeting between the leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, there is no other way for the anti-Axis countries to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch from London, according to a news article, the successor to the Governor-General of India, Linlithgow, is scheduled to be a member of the British wartime cabinet, and the British cabinet will implement a partial reorganization within the month.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces in Tunisia Determined to Defend Coastal Fortresses; British and American Forces Advance in a Fan Shape Along Three Routes; Taibuba Will Become the Center of Future Battles</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch. A military correspondent for the Overseas News Agency says that on Tuesday, only local battles took place on the northwestern front of Tunisia. After capturing Matil, the anti-Axis forces sent reconnaissance teams to explore and advance towards the new positions of the German and Italian forces. The future intentions of the anti-Axis forces are still difficult to understand. The French colonial forces now located in the isthmus between the Mediterranean Sea and the northwest coast of Lake Akel have been reinforced by American forces. However, it is still questionable whether this fact alone can judge whether the British and American sides are determined to take concentrated action along the coast to capture Bize. In the more southern region, the vanguard of the American Second Army advanced in a fan shape along three routes from Matil: the first route advanced northeast, attacking the ferry village between Lake Akel and Bize; the second route advanced east, aiming at Jebel Kegibota, because both highways from Tunis to Bize are under its control; the third route advanced southeast, targeting Taibuba. It is still difficult to judge where the anti-Axis command will concentrate its main offensive. If its purpose is to split the German and Italian front into two, it will have to capture Jebel Kegibota, because it is not only a strong defensive position, but also its location is within the range of the outer fortress line of the Bize battery. The anti-Axis forces will naturally need considerable force to attack the area. The American army has indeed obtained considerable reinforcements from General Anderson, but it is still questionable whether the British and American forces concentrated in the Matil area have sufficient strength for a three-pronged attack. As mentioned above, it is difficult to predict how the decision of the American Supreme Commander will be, but judging from the situation, it seems more convenient to choose the route to attack Taibuba, because there is a possibility of cooperating with the central route of the British First Army. On Tuesday, the British First Army repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the German positions northeast of Mejez el-Bab, and some places were once attacked, but were repelled after a German counterattack. The pressure exerted by the anti-Axis forces in the area suggests that the war may continue to intensify. It is also possible that the area around Taibuba will occupy an important position in future battles. On the other hand, there is nothing important to report on the front line, except for the fact that the French rebel attack on Peng Dufas was repelled, and the artillery fire activity of the anti-Axis forces on the southern line was more intense, which is worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Speech: Deeply Believes That Final Victory Will Be Won</h3>
<p>Rome, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to Stefani News Agency: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made a brief speech on the balcony of the Venice Palace yesterday, reiterating Italy's firm determination to fight to the end in order to win the final victory, and said that Italians will return to Africa. The newly appointed Secretary of the Fascist Party, Siscochai, held a reception at the Venice Palace, which was attended by senior party leaders from various provinces. The masses then gathered in front of the palace, shouting for the Prime Minister to appear. When the Prime Minister appeared on the balcony, they immediately asked the Prime Minister to speak. The Prime Minister immediately agreed. During the speech, the masses repeatedly cheered. The Prime Minister declared: "Your voices seem to be filled with indestructible faith and supreme confidence. Faith in Fascism, trust in the sacrifices in these difficult times, will surely achieve final victory, if God is fair, and Italy is eternal. Nine years ago, I spoke on this balcony about the completion of the African expedition and the establishment of the Italian Empire. This development has not ended, but it is only a moment of rest. I know that thousands of Italians feel infinite pain for the so-called African diseases. We only have one way to cure it, that is to return. We will return. At present, what is absolutely necessary is to respect the wartime contempt for cowards and the shooting of traitors, regardless of which class or race they belong to. This is not only my personal opinion, I think you and the entire Italy must have the same opinion."</p>
<h3>Major General Kai William Succeeds as Commander of American Forces in Europe</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to British capital news, London officially announced yesterday that after the death of Lieutenant General Antru, commander-in-chief of the American forces in Europe, in a plane crash in Iceland, the vacancy has been temporarily filled by Major General Kai William, because Kai has the highest qualifications.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch from London, the US European Expeditionary Force Command issued a statement on the 4th stating that Lieutenant General Andrew, commander of the US forces in Europe, died in a plane crash in Iceland on the 3rd. It was supplemented on the 5th that Major General Port, chief of staff of the army, also died at the same time as Lieutenant General Andrew.</p>
<h3>German Forces Improve Positions in the Eastern Front Kupensk Area; German Long-Range Guns Bombing Leningrad</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch According to qualified sources yesterday, after the Soviet army suffered heavy losses in attacking the German positions in the Kupensk bridgehead in the past few days, it has temporarily eased its attacks. On the morning of May 4, the German army had withdrawn from the town of Krimskaya. The Soviet army did not discover the German army's withdrawal preparations, so the German army's withdrawal from the town and its northern and southern adjacent areas was not hindered by the enemy army. The withdrawn position is deeply embedded eastward, forming a prominent area, which is extremely unfavorable for defense. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw the new German position west of Krimskaya, which is extremely favorable for defense, because it is protected by towering mountains behind it. According to a military correspondent for the Overseas News Agency, the withdrawal from Krimskaya is of no importance militarily, and strategically, the Soviet army has not gained any benefit, because the town is located on the plain, and the new German position is on the mountain slope west of the town. At the same time, the German front has also been greatly shortened, so the German army's strength must also be greatly increased. If the German army adds its reserves to the battle, it will not be difficult to defend the town and recapture the position southeast of the town that the Soviet army gained on Monday. However, the German army did not do this, because this move would not be worth the loss and would violate the German army's saving of strength in preparation for a more important operation. According to the current situation, the German army's ability to smoothly maintain the Kupensk bridgehead can also guarantee that although the battle has now eased, the Soviet army's offensive may continue.</p>
<h3>German Planes Bombard British Industrial Center in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th Central News Agency dispatch The city of Reading, west of London, was bombed by German planes yesterday in broad daylight, causing considerable casualties. Reading has a population of 100,000 and is a center for machinery and textile industries.</p>
<h3>British Planes Attack Four German Units; Thirty-Six Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th Central News Agency dispatch The German authorities announced on the 5th that 36 British planes were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery and fighter squadrons during the air raid on western Germany on the 3rd. In addition, five anti-Axis aircraft were shot down off the coasts of France and Belgium, and two British aircraft were shot down off the coast of Norway.</p>
<h3>Mexican Military Exercises</h3>
<p>Aijing, 6th Central News Agency dispatch According to Mexican news, the Mexican army, including infantry and artillery, held exercises yesterday in the Pabla area. Many anti-Axis officers and the Argentine Military Commission attended the inspection. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people participated in the exercises.</p>
<h3>American Military Authorities Take Over Italian Colonies</h3>
<p>Rome, 6th Central News Agency dispatch, according to Asmara via Istanbul news, the Italian Chief of Staff of Eritrea has been detained by the American side, and it is said that the Italian colony has now been taken over by the American military authorities.</p>
<h3>The Way to National Prosperity and Decline</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>The recent editorials of the Shen Bao have discussed China's "Way to National Prosperity and Decline" twice in succession. The conclusion stated: "Every public official in government institutions, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres, should be a role model for the people of the whole country and establish a clean and upright political atmosphere." A certain Japanese person, upon reading this editorial, said that such abstract, moralistic arguments ultimately cannot solve the difficulties faced by the Nanjing government. In the Doctrine of the Mean, there is a saying: "The Way is not far from man. If one cultivates a Way that is far from man, it cannot be regarded as the Way." I believe that only by implementing this morally clear proposal that everyone understands can we truly find China's way to national prosperity and decline. Before explaining the rationale behind this, it is necessary to first discuss China's unique characteristics.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, in Europe, the state (government) and the church are separate institutions. The church is responsible for the morality of the people, while the state (government) is responsible for maintaining social order. In China, however, the state shoulders responsibilities in both areas. In Europe, the source of morality is God; in China, the source of morality is the state. More specifically, it is the actions of public officials, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres. In China, Buddhism has never been allowed to manage the morality of the living, and now, it can only manage the citizen certificates of the dead. Confucianism has long been buried in the dust, and now, it is only used by extravagant people to quote their favorite passages. Even during the prosperous times of Buddhism and Confucianism in China, very few people sacrificed their lives for the Way, but many, like Wen Tianxiang, sacrificed themselves for the state. Therefore, in China, if the people lose respect for the state's highest leader, the nation's morality inevitably declines rapidly. The saying "what is above, the below will follow" is meant to indicate this relationship in terms of morality. And the "above" here refers to the nation's highest leader and the officials below him. To become an official in China, one must pass three rigorous examinations on classics and ancient poetry. Only after passing these tests and becoming a "xiucai" (licentiate), "juren" (recommended man), and "jinshi" (presented scholar) are they allowed to be granted an official position. Even if this examination system seems ridiculous, it is a very meaningful system considering China's unique characteristic that officials are the source of the nation's morality. Because in order to pass these examinations, one must be well-versed in countless ancient books. During this period, officials personally receive moral and cultural education. Therefore, relying on this examination system, Chinese scholar-officials have long been the pillars of Chinese national morality. Even though scholar-officials are seen as ridiculous in today's revolutionary China, we cannot deny their contribution to maintaining national morality through their education and morality.</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty's regime, and at the same time, the scholar-officials who guided the Qing Dynasty's national morality were also expelled from the government. As a result, China's national morality inevitably experienced a terrifying state of anarchy. A new morality to replace the old morality has not yet been established. Therefore, although the old morality has lost its pillar, its palace has not yet collapsed. It remains an empty house. The New Youth Movement in 1915 first began the work of demolishing this great palace of morality. Their attitude was explained in the "New Youth's Defense Against Accusations," published in 1919:</p>
<p>"What they accuse this magazine of is nothing more than destroying Confucianism, destroying ritual, destroying national essence, destroying chastity, destroying old ethics (loyalty, filial piety, and chastity), destroying old art (Chinese opera), destroying old teachings (ghosts and gods), destroying old literature, and destroying old politics (privilege and autocracy). This magazine and its colleagues certainly admit to these accusations. However, tracing back to the source, the colleagues of this magazine are originally innocent. Only because they support Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science did they commit these heinous crimes. To support Mr. Democracy, one must oppose Confucianism, ritual, chastity, old ethics, and old politics. To support Mr. Science, one must oppose national essence and old literature."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the New Youth Movement was only eager to destroy the old morality and did not touch on the construction of a replacement new morality. Therefore, that movement not only failed to completely destroy the palace left by the old morality, but even it itself did not complete the conceptual diagram of a new national morality. As a result, what invaded this empty house was the culture that Goethe called "Anglo-Saxon Contagion," imported from the British and Americans in Shanghai. In "The Story of a Chinese Oxford Movement" by Ku Hung-Ming, published in 1912, it is said:</p>
<p>"The foreigners in Shanghai are delighted that the new China under Yuan Shikai has cut off its queues and adopted European culture. These misguided people do not understand at all that the culture adopted by the new China is by no means European civilization, but only the European civilization of Shanghai - that is, the culture of Anglo-Saxon disease that Goethe spoke of. The disease of genuine European civilization is now developing in China." (See page 22 of the original book)</p>
<p>How appropriate this is for modern Shanghai, no, China, the reader can see and hear for themselves, without me having to repeat it. At this time and in this place, there is plenty of Anglo-Saxon culture, but it is no longer its original face, but rather a degenerate Anglo-American culture made in Shanghai. This culture is neither the religion that manages morality nor the state that manages social order. All that exists is the morality of money and the social order of money. The possessor of money is the determinant of morality, and thus the ruler, it is the world of Soong Tzu-wen and Kong Xiangxi. How they made their fortunes today, I will not say much here. Behind their wealth, I don't know how many bankrupt people are waiting to die on the streets, and I don't know how many good farmers have been stripped of their land for usurious loans. Yet, they are the so-called model gentlemen of this society, striding proudly. Such gentlemen have not yet disappeared recently. Two or three years ago, they were still "bums" on the streets, but in a short time, they have accumulated tens of millions of assets. Among them, there are even those who have no idea what their proper business is. Yet, people are not surprised by the source of their wealth, but rather treat them as "rich masters" and treat them with the courtesy of new gentlemen. In this kind of morality, gambling is considered a "noble entertainment," and gambling venues naturally become gentlemen's clubs. Under wartime economics, ordinary families are saving electricity, and streetlights have been turned off from around 8:00 PM, and factories have been forced to shorten their work due to saving electricity. However, these clubs are able to keep their magnificent lights on all night and "operate all night." In this kind of morality, people in society dare not blame even if people with social status compete to hoard goods, opium addicts become high officials, and drowsily hear cases. This is the reality of "Anglo-Saxon Contagion". Confucius once said, "Free and without shame". Shanghai, no, China's morality today, is truly what is called free and shameless morality.</p>
<p>The current task of the Nanjing government today lies in driving this decadent culture out of China and building the Three Principles of the People morality that Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to implement but could not. The driving force for this movement in China is neither Confucianism nor Buddhism, but rather the actions of all members of government institutions from the highest leader downwards. Just as scholar-officials were the supporters of the old morality, new officials must also become the pillars of the new morality. Every official cannot but possess the passion to "be a role model for the people of the whole country and establish a clean and upright political atmosphere." However, in fact, it cannot be asserted that there are no government officials who absolutely do not commit "Anglo-Saxon Contagion". For this reason, the New National Movement initiated by Chairman Wang has great significance. Chairman Wang defined the New National Movement in his "Letter to the People of the Nation" issued on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital:</p>
<p>"For a hundred years, our compatriots have been oppressed by British and American politics, militarily invaded, and economically exploited. These are all tangible. However, cultural anesthesia has made our compatriots unknowingly forget themselves in their thinking. These intangible poisons are more harmful than the tangible ones, many times over. To defeat the forces of Britain and America, we must first clear the British and American thoughts in each person's mind. This is the first priority of our engagement in the Greater East Asia War and the first move of the total war. How can we eliminate them? To defeat others, we must first build ourselves. The New National Movement is the way to build ourselves."</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's movement of self-construction that he speaks of here must be the revolution against Anglo-Saxon culture, i.e., Shanghai culture, and also the moral construction movement of China's inherent culture, especially the new China.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang said: "The anesthesia of Anglo-Saxon culture is an intangible poison, many times more harmful than the tangible ones," which is a profound statement. However, I would like to offer a suggestion here: the New National Movement should first begin with the elimination of tangible poisons. Hoarding, opium smoking, and gambling are all products of Anglo-Saxon culture. If the New National Movement first eliminates these "tangible poisons," the subsequent development will be much easier. If the "tangible poisons" cannot be solved, then solving the "intangible poisons" will be many times more difficult. However, as a practical matter, even the solution of these tangible poisons is facing many difficulties before the New National Movement. To overcome these difficulties, relying solely on the efforts of the government is not enough. The intellectual class of the people must first respond and assist the government. If government officials each have the belief in being a role model for the people, and are not succumbed by difficulties, and eliminate the poisons in society one by one, then the intellectual class in the peaceful areas, even if unwilling, will automatically come to support the government.</p>
<p>If the intellectual class on the Chongqing side sees that the accumulated evils of China are being eliminated one by one by the New National Movement, they will also come to participate in the peace camp! This victory of the new morality is precisely the foundation for overall peace. (May 3. Translated by: Xiang)</p>

<h3>The Unjust Death of Young Zhang Jinhai: The Authorities Pay Great Attention; Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration Comes to Shanghai to Monitor the Development</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong, apprentices at the Cheng Ji Shirt and Socks Factory in the Lafayette Department Store in the French Concession, were arrested on the 28th of last month. Zhang Jinhai died on the 30th due to severe injuries from torture, and Peng Shuanglong was seriously injured. Regarding this case, this newspaper will record the developments as follows: It was found that Zhang Jinhai's body was sent to the morgue on Talas Road at 4:00 PM on the 1st, claiming he died of illness, and was reported to the Second Special District Court for examination. In addition to the French Concession Police representative Sanderli and his assistant physician Zhao Kaishu, the chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, Mr. Shen Wenjie, after receiving the report, suspected that according to precedent, non-noble Chinese were not allowed to be moved to the Talas Road morgue for examination. Therefore, he personally led the examination team, along with forensic doctors Wang Guoan and Guan Shouhua, to rush to the morgue to perform an autopsy. The examination's determination of the cause of death is as follows:</p>
<p>Determination of Death Due to Severe Injuries: It was found that the deceased Zhang Jinhai was 19 years old, originally from Zhenjiang, a businessman, measured 64 inches in height, 14 inches in shoulder width, and 7.5 inches in chest height.</p>
<p>External Examination: Pale yellow complexion, good nutrition throughout the body, foam flowing from the mouth, and a small amount of liquid flowing from the nostrils. Swelling of the scalp on the left head, about two inches in circumference. Dark purple discoloration of the skin in the left temporal region, with a subcutaneous bleeding spot, about three centimeters in circumference. Dark purple discoloration of the skin on the front side of the left chest ribs, with five subcutaneous bleeding spots: four the size of a double corner coin, and one the size of a silver dollar. Two red indentations on the back of the left wrist joint, each the size of a soybean. Mild swelling on the backs of both hands, with no other injuries or abnormalities in other parts.</p>
<p>Internal Examination: Head Cavity Examination: The head was cut open and peeled off in the standard manner, and subcutaneous bleeding spots of varying sizes were seen on the left head and left temporal region, consistent with what was seen externally. No fractures or breaks in the skull. No bleeding or other injuries to the brain. Chest and Abdominal Cavity Examination: The skin of the chest and abdomen was cut along the midline. No abnormalities in the chest organs, and no bleeding. However, subcutaneous bleeding in the left anterior chest rib area was obvious and extensive, with bleeding spots from the second rib to the eighth rib. When the ribs were sawn, there were also bleeding spots on the pleura on the left side of the anterior chest, also from the second rib to the eighth rib. A large amount of purple-red blood was stored in the abdominal cavity, a clear sign of internal organ bleeding. The liver was found to have ruptured, with a large amount of clotted blood. No abnormalities in the other organs.</p>
<p>Examination Explanation: The wounds on the head and left temporal region were caused by blunt force. These two wounds are difficult to recognize as having a direct relationship to the cause of death. The wounds on the left anterior chest rib area were also caused by blunt force. The rupture of the spleen in the abdominal cavity can be determined from the internal and external injuries of the chest ribs, i.e., bleeding spots. The wounds on the left wrist joint and the swelling on the backs of both hands appear to be caused by tight pressure from ropes, shackles, etc., but are not fatal. Therefore, it is determined that the body died due to external blunt force to the chest ribs, leading to a rupture of the spleen and bleeding from the spleen.</p>
<p>The Second Special Court Lodges a Serious Protest: Since the examination's conclusion of Zhang Jinhai's death was due to injuries sustained before death, Chen Bingjun, the president of the Second Special District Court, and Shen Wenjie, the chief prosecutor, immediately lodged a serious oral protest with the French Concession authorities to maintain legal rights and protect the legal interests of citizens, demanding that the French suspect Miret be punished according to the law. They also immediately sent the Chinese detective Zhu Songcheng and others who participated in the torture and forced confession to the court for strict punishment according to the law.</p>
<p>Minister Luo Makes a Special Trip to Shanghai: Since the Zhang case occurred, Luo Junqiang, the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, learned of it and paid great attention to it. He made a special trip from Beijing to Shanghai to closely monitor the development of the case. The Second Special Court also submitted the examination's conclusion of the body and the process of negotiation to Minister Luo for review, and requested instructions on appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Complaint: The case has already been filed with the Second Special Court by the family of the deceased, Wang Shi. The original text of their appeal is recorded below:</p>
<p>Complainant: Zhang Yuanji</p>
<p>Defendants: Ms. Li, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Yusheng, Zhu Songcheng, Translator Li, West Detective No. 23, Wang Shu, Miret</p>
<p>Accusation of Framing the Innocent, Embezzling Lost Items, Torture, and Murder: Seeking Justice for Crimes of Lawlessness. I, the complainant's only son, Jinhai, is an adopted son, newly working at the Cheng Ji Shirt and Socks Factory at No. 292 Cai Shi Road. The rules are extremely strict, and he has never committed a crime. On the afternoon of April 28, the first defendant, Ms. Li, purchased goods worth over 100 yuan from the staff Kang Wanqing. The next morning, she came and asked if a laundry voucher had been lost here during the purchase of goods yesterday. The store manager, Zhang Yuebo, personally searched carefully but did not find it and told her the truth before she left. Not long after, the first defendant, together with the owner of the Yihua Laundry Shop, the second defendant Guo Shiyuan, the staff member, the third defendant Feng Jinsheng, and the Chinese detective, the fourth defendant Zhu Songcheng, swarmed into the store with a threatening presence. Feng Jinsheng arbitrarily pointed out that the apprentice Peng Shuanglong seemed to have taken the ticket to pick up the clothes. Therefore, the fourth defendant arrested Peng and took him to the police station, where the Chinese detective and the fifth defendant, Translator Li, beat him severely with sticks to force a confession. Then, he was imprisoned in another room, where the sixth defendant, West Detective No. 23, inflicted severe torture. Peng, unable to endure it, falsely confessed that the complainant's son, Jinhai (had picked up a piece of paper from the ground, whether it was this one or not, he did not know), and so on. As a result, the detective Zhu Songcheng arrested the complainant's son, Jinhai, and took him to the police station. The defendants, Zhu Songcheng, West Detective No. 23, and Translator Li, and three others, took turns inflicting severe torture and repeated beatings. At this time, the second defendant, Guo Shiyuan, said to the above four defendants (He is an old hand; you must make him confess.) Then, he used French to instigate the eighth defendant, West Detective Miret, to drag him into another small room. Then, the above four detectives (i.e., Zhu, Li, outside person No. 23) jointly tortured him with cruel methods. When he was on the verge of death, West Detective Miret personally committed an inhumane and extremely cruel act. At this time, the store manager Zhang Yuebo was waiting in the outer room, and at first, he could still hear the tragic cries and screams, intermittently. After a few minutes, there was no sound at all. He only heard the detectives whispering privately, saying (The Zhang guy is already finished.) At this time, the store manager Yuebo still did not understand the full extent of what had happened. Then, the detective and Guo Shiyuan said to Zhang Yuebo (You can go back for now; we'll take him to the public court tomorrow.) How could he know that the next day, the complainant's son, Jinhai, had already been tortured to death by Miret and five others through torture. In addition to the fact that the body has already been presented to your court's prosecutor's office for examination, stating that all ribs from the second to the eighth rib were severely injured, and the temples and skull were also severely injured, and the abdomen was filled with dirty blood, and the spleen inside the abdomen was completely broken, etc., the death certificate is filled out and attached to the file. It is suspected that Ms. Li already had doubts about my lost laundry voucher. How could the first defendant, Ms. Li, and the second defendant, Feng Jinsheng, fabricate claims out of thin air, frame the innocent for embezzlement, and instigate detectives to force a confession? From the beginning, they had a bad motive, and the result ultimately caused a tragedy. Although they did not directly kill, they fabricated facts and allowed detectives to torture and force confessions to subject others to criminal penalties, which is a crime under Article 169 of the Criminal Law. Decisive investigation agencies must have a legal basis for detaining and interrogating people. If there is suspicion of a crime, they should also be transferred to the court for trial within 24 hours. Returning to the point, even if Jinhai's embezzlement of lost items is true, the penalty would only be a fine. Now, the detectives Miret, Zhu Songcheng, Wang Shu, Translator Li, and West Detective No. 23, etc., clearly knew that it was a very minor case, but they spared no effort in taking turns using inhumane torture, even when he was on the verge of death, they still did not stop, fully demonstrating that their initial purpose had already spawned the intention to kill, ultimately leading to the complainant's son dying tragically due to being unable to withstand the torture. As for Miret, the main culprit who kicked Jinhai to death with the final kick, they have each separately committed the same laws, Articles 125, 30, and 271. The crime of dereliction of duty and helping to kill should be severely punished. Furthermore, the defendant Guo Shiyuan was the one who instigated West Detective Miret and others to severely torture the complainant's son to death on the spot, committing the crime of instigating murder under Articles 29 and 271 of the same law, and should be severely punished. In short, the above-mentioned detectives bear the heavy responsibility of guarding the local security. Under this bright sky and clear daylight, they dare to rely on the relationship of the concession to torture innocent civilians illegally, running rampant without regard for the law, and being shrouded in darkness. If they are not immediately arrested and punished according to the maximum penalties of the above articles, not only will the injustice sink to the bottom of the sea, making it impossible to ever redress the wrong, but it is also feared that similar cases will occur in the future, and people's lives will not be guaranteed. Therefore, this complaint is filed, and I earnestly request your court to review and approve the investigation, and to punish the defendants with the appropriate punishment to uphold the national law. This is truly a debt of gratitude. Respectfully submitted to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Court Resumes Investigation and Interrogation: After the French Consulate General's Police Superintendent requested it, due to the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Lafayette Cheng Ji Socks and Shirt Factory, within the French Police Department, the Consul's Court President has been ordered to conduct a detailed investigation. All personnel who can testify have been suspended from work. It is heard that the French Consul's Court summoned the injured apprentice Peng Shuanglong from Guangci Hospital for questioning yesterday.</p>
<p>Group Meeting: The Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association has scheduled a temporary meeting of various groups for 1:00 PM today to discuss the steps to take for negotiation regarding the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai. It is heard that the participating groups will include the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, the China Hongmen United Association, the Shanghai Xingya Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist League, the Zhenjiang Fellow Association, and the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, among other groups. It is also heard that further discussions will be made, including (1) punishing the murderers, (2) compensating the family of the deceased, (3) requesting the French Concession Police to guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future, and (4) sending telegrams to the National Government, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, urging serious negotiations to value human life. Furthermore, the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association specially telegraphed all sectors of the country yesterday for support to show justice and redress the great injustice. The Municipal Farmers' Association also issued a declaration.</p>
<h3>Automatically Fundraising to Comfort the Family</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Warehouse and Wharf Industry Association wrote a letter stating: "Having read your newspaper's 'Publication of Zhang Yuanji's son, Zhang Jinhai, suffering unjust treatment and dying innocently,' we are deeply saddened, even though we are not relatives or friends with Mr. Zhang. Outraged, and to express human sympathy, we have specially collected 5,000 yuan for the Zhang Jinhai's funeral expenses and Zhang Yuanji's support funds, and send it to your newspaper office to forward it on their behalf. We also ask you to appeal to all sectors to show sympathy and uphold justice."</p>
<p>Also, indignant citizens wrote a letter stating that they automatically donated and collected 400 Central Reserve Certificates and sent them to this newspaper to collect and transfer them to help Zhang's family. Also, Mr. Yang Zhongshu and Mr. Lin Zhimu, moved by righteous indignation, jointly donated 100 yuan. It has been verified that the above funds are currently temporarily stored in the newspaper office, awaiting transfer.</p>
<h3>Second Phase: Purchasing Oil with Housing Donation Tickets Begins Today; Four Ounces Per Person at Five Yuan and One Dime; The Method is Exactly the Same as the First Phase</h3>
<p>The second phase of purchasing oil based on housing donation tickets per capita in this city is still approved by the food oil wholesale office to allocate 500 tons by the military allocation authorities, and the office has completed all the procedures. Starting today (7th), the public concession will purchase oil at designated oil stores from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily with winter housing donation tickets and household head's citizen certificates, the French concession will purchase oil with January and February housing donation tickets and household head's identity cards, and the western Shanghai Zhabei district will purchase oil with household registration certificates and household head's residence certificates. The method is exactly the same as the previous phase.</p>
<p>Oil Sales Deadline is the 17th: As for the quantity, it is still four ounces per person, but the selling price must be calculated according to the new price of 20 yuan and 4 cents per catty, with four ounces of edible oil costing 5 yuan and 1 dime. At the same time, the allocation of this edible oil by the office is calculated according to the number of people surveyed by the Baojia authorities. Therefore, citizens can purchase the amount they are entitled to at the designated retail oil stores within the time limit without having to rush and cause chaos. Furthermore, each retail oil store must sell as much as possible in accordance with the regulations and must not refuse on any pretext or deduct the quantity. Otherwise, citizens can report it, and the office will cancel the retail rights and report it to the police authorities for investigation according to the law. The deadline for oil sales is the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Procedures for the Nanshi Area Not Yet Completed: The Nanshi area has not been allocated for sale at the same time as the two concessions because the procedures have not yet been fully completed, and it will be delayed for a few days until the 10th of this month. The quantity and price are the same as the two concessions.</p>
<h3>This Month's Rationed Sugar Sales to Begin on the 11th</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of the Shanghai District Sugar Industry Association, the allocation of sugar in this city will continue to be handled by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. All Category A and B retailers have also been required to join the association and remain responsible for sales. The allocation for this month's rationed sugar sales is currently being processed by the office, with the official start date set for the 11th of this month. Retail sugar stores must complete payment and collection procedures upon receiving notification from the office to ensure timely implementation. The quantity remains at four taels per person, priced at 2.35 yuan. Packaging costs will be charged separately for packaged sugar.</p>
<p>Special Allocations to be Processed Continuously　Furthermore, special sugar allocations required for various businesses are being continuously reviewed and processed by the office. However, due to the large number of accounts, a gradual allocation approach is being adopted. Allocations will be made as reviews are completed. Stores receiving notification from the office must complete payment and collection within the specified deadline. Resale is strictly prohibited; otherwise, allocations will be suspended.</p>
<h3>The Rationed Grain System is Now Firmly Established</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the rationed grain system in this city, it has greatly benefited the people's food supply. Recent rumors circulating in the market suggesting that authorities would discontinue the rationed grain system due to the decline in black market rice prices are absolutely false. The authorities have firmly established the rationed grain system and there is no possibility of it being discontinued midway.</p>
<p>Allocations Will Be Increased as Much as Possible　The authorities will increase the rationed grain allocations as much as possible, emphasizing allocations for the general population. To ensure equitable distribution, the Rice and Grain Affairs Office has reduced the extra grain allocation from two sheng to one sheng per period, starting this period. Additionally, the flour allocated to noodle product businesses will be discontinued and reallocated to the general population to increase the flour allocation as much as possible.</p>
<p>Household Grain Sales in West Shanghai to Begin Today　The 12th phase of household rice allocation in the West Shanghai district, totaling 4,500 bags, has been distributed by the West Shanghai District Public Rice Sales Office. Sales are scheduled to begin today. It is reported that due to the offsetting of leftover rice from the previous period, each person can purchase two sheng of whole rice, totaling six yuan.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of the French Concession Police in the Wrongful Death of Zhang Jinhai</h3>
<p>For several days, newspapers have carried notices from lawyers Shao Bao-san and Gu Ru-wen, representing Mr. Zhang Yuan-ji, appealing for an investigation. The facts are as follows: A 19-year-old youth from Zhenjiang, Zhang Jinhai, unfortunately died from torture inflicted by several detectives of the French Concession Police due to a baseless accusation. This case has shaken the entire Shanghai society, shocked every citizen, and evoked a resonance of human justice.</p>
<p>First, from a legal perspective, even if Zhang Jinhai had committed a crime, the French Concession Police should have transferred him to the court within 24 hours after questioning for public prosecution and legal proceedings. However, the French Concession Police did not transfer him to the court but instead resorted to torture, leading to his tragic death. The responsibility for this naturally falls on the personnel of the French Concession Police involved.</p>
<p>Second, from a humanitarian perspective, at most, Zhang Jinhai's crime was "falsely claiming a coat." Why resort to severe torture? Based on common sense, a 19-year-old youth is in the prime of development, physically strong. Death from torture undoubtedly indicates extremely cruel and inhumane punishment.</p>
<p>The French Concession Police is a law enforcement agency, and the use of punishment is the responsibility of law enforcement personnel. Now that law enforcement personnel have abused their power and become law-breaking personnel, the French Concession Police, to maintain the dignity of the entire law enforcement agency, must promptly bring the law-breaking personnel to justice, openly admit their mistake, and apologize to society. At the same time, they should properly handle the aftermath for the wrongfully deceased and provide generous compensation to the innocent. This is the wise and appropriate action for the French Concession Police. If they protect their subordinates who break the law and disregard human justice, they will inevitably face unfortunate consequences. The French Concession Police authorities are urged to carefully consider the path of right and wrong.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the police authorities will caution their subordinates, improve their methods of punishment, and remember the ancient Chinese saying: "If you don't want others to know, don't do it." We offer this to all members of the French Concession Police, hoping they will carefully consider it. (Supplement)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Press Department Hosts Reporters to Discuss the Situation of the U.S.-China Air Force in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai hosted a regular meeting of the Chinese press corps of this city. A Japanese spokesperson discussed the current situation of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, stating that although the U.S. and Chongqing forces may attempt to stir up trouble, they will absolutely find it difficult to realize their dream of attacking Japan.</p>
<p>U.S.-China Air Force　The Japanese spokesperson first stated that one of the main goals of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is to attempt to stir up trouble against Japan, planning to take action in the Taiwan and Kyushu areas. In the current situation, they are preparing to strengthen their forward bases in Quzhou, Guilin, Lingling, and Hengyang. Therefore, Japanese aircraft attacked Lingling and Yunnanyi on April 25, 26, and 27, destroying more than 40 enemy aircraft. Although we are confident that the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing will find it difficult to retaliate after our victory, we must also be meticulously prepared. The recent visit of the commander of the U.S. forces in Chongqing, Stilwell, and the commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force, Chennault, to the United States to meet with Roosevelt is aimed at strengthening their strength in Chongqing and formulating their battle plans. However, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing not only has not made any progress to date but also faces the threat of Japanese air strikes at any time. The spokesperson then continued to discuss the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Deadlock Difficult to Resolve　To verify the U.S.-China Air Force’s unrealistic attempt to stir up trouble, they will inevitably cooperate with the Chongqing Air Force. However, the U.S. and Chongqing sides have divergent opinions, and this deadlock is difficult to break, making it even harder to unite for joint operations against Japan. At the same time, Japan's air defense preparations, air defense training, and air force production are rapidly progressing. Furthermore, the production of the newest fighters is increasing, and their power is greater. All of this demonstrates that we have sufficient strength. Therefore, the U.S. attempt will be difficult to realize, and any rash actions may lead to complete destruction. As such, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing can only engage in empty propaganda, making it difficult to unleash its full potential. Recently, the Chongqing climate has provided a good opportunity for the Japanese Air Force to launch air strikes, and more aggressive attacks are expected in the future, while the Chongqing side is still unaware that the crisis is imminent.</p>
<p>Strength of the Chongqing Army　Finally, the spokesperson discussed the strength of the Chongqing army. Because the Chongqing army has not been able to expand, they are currently focusing on strengthening their own combat capabilities. It is foreseeable that the Japanese army will eventually occupy the inland areas, so they must prepare and replenish their military supplies. The majority of Chongqing's military supplies rely on foreign sources, imported through the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, due to transportation difficulties, ammunition and all military supplies are difficult to obtain as desired. Furthermore, the internal and external routes have been cut off, and the inconvenience of internal transportation is exacerbated by the threat of Japanese air strikes, resulting in demoralized troops on the front lines. Even if they are strengthened, it will be difficult to achieve effective results. Therefore, it is difficult for the U.S. and Chongqing Air Forces to launch an offensive against Japan.</p>
<h3>Fourth Round of Cigarette Distribution to Increase Amount; Progressive New System of Proportional Distribution to be Announced; Unrestricted Price Cigarette Prices</h3>
<p>To fully distribute cigarettes and maintain order in the market, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association is implementing an increased allocation for the fourth round of distribution. Previously, a four-tier system of A, B, C, and D was used, with distribution ratios of 1:2:3:4. This has now been changed to a new system of 1:2:4:8. For example, the value of a D card allocation is 2,500 yuan, a C card is 5,000 yuan, a B card is 10,000 yuan, and an A card is 20,000 yuan. The distributed goods include products from the military-managed Yuanchang Tobacco Company, the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company, and Chinese-owned Huacheng, Nanyang, Dadong, and Fuxin factories. Starting from the 5th, wholesalers and retailers were notified to make payments and collect goods from the designated distribution points and Datonghang, with the intention of completing everything by the 15th. As for the products of other cigarette factories that were not included in the initially announced price limits, the association has submitted a request to the authorities for approval, and the price limits will be announced soon. Regarding the registration of wholesalers in the suburbs of Shanghai, it has been completed and distribution will be implemented. Distribution in other areas of Huazhong has already begun, and cigarette prices are completely uniform, so the practice of reselling for profit will inevitably be curbed.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Price-Controlled Cigarettes</h3>
<p>"Nowhere to be seen are price-controlled cigarettes!" This is practically the reality that every citizen of Shanghai hears and sees today. In recent days, because the fourth round of cigarette allocation is here, this column has received many articles from the public concerning the elimination of the cigarette black market. Although due to limited space, it's not possible to reveal them for now, the public's opinion on price-controlled cigarettes has allowed us to gather a great consensus.</p>
<p>As everyone says, the style of squeezing rice and sugar from a few months ago has now turned into squeezing cigarettes. However, the worst phenomenon in the entire price-controlled cigarette market is not "squeezing cigarettes," but "hiding" them. The origin of cigarettes is very obvious, but the whereabouts are unclear—because price-controlled cigarettes have all gone into the black market. As a result, price-controlled cigarettes have merely become warehouses for the cigarette black market. This is certainly something that the allocation authorities did not anticipate.</p>
<p>Regarding countermeasures to eliminate the cigarette black market, many opinions have been contributed from various parties. For example, some advocate that, in terms of allocation, the Baojia system should be used to implement cigarette distribution on a per capita basis, similar to the methods of distributing rice, sugar, and oil. Some advocate that, in terms of investigation, a more stringent organization should be implemented, similar to the plainclothes ticket inspectors recently dispatched by the tram company. Some advocate that, in terms of penalties, in addition to permanently stopping distribution, the person in charge of the cigarette retail store should be handed over to the competent authorities for investigation and punishment, similar to the punishment suffered by the owners of two cigarette stores in western Shanghai some time ago. Some advocate that, in terms of reporting, the public should be given full authority to report and accuse to the distribution association or nearby government offices, and to cooperate with newspapers for public announcement, just as is done with the suppression of speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>These methods are obviously reasonable in principle. However, action speaks louder than words. How these methods—or other equally effective methods—are implemented and when they are implemented is the responsibility of the cigarette allocation authorities, and not something that the consuming public can do.</p>
<h3>Strict Management of Bank and Money Shop Operations; Regulations on the Use of Deposit Funds; Implementation of Inspections on the Business Status of Various Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>To strictly manage the operations of various banks and money shops, the Ministry of Finance, in addition to ordering the payment of required reserves for fixed and current deposits, is having the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank implement inspections of the assets, liabilities, and business status of various banks and money shops, and has stipulated: (1) When financial institutions accept collateral due to the settlement of debts, regardless of whether it is movable property (excluding securities) or immovable property, it should be disposed of within one year. (2) Those who have been engaged in businesses outside the scope of laws and regulations before the implementation of the Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions should terminate such businesses within one year after the implementation of the detailed rules of the Measures.</p>
<p>Regulations on the Use of Deposit Funds　As for banks and money shops engaging in savings business, the regulations on the use of savings funds are: (1) The chattel mortgage loans to rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. (2) Loans secured by immovable property with continuous and reliable income shall not exceed one-fifth of their total deposits. (3) Loans secured by time deposit certificates or accounts of other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of their total deposits. (4) The purchase of bills of exchange accepted by other banks shall not exceed one-twentieth of their total deposits. (5) The deposit in other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of their total deposits. (6) The purchase of government bonds and loans secured by marketable securities shall not exceed one-tenth of the total paid-up capital and public reserve.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Advisor Kimura - Speaks to Newspaper Reporters - On the Issue of Enriching the Content of the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>To clarify the contents of the Central Reserve Bank’s efforts to seek improvement, so that the people can have a deeper understanding, Mr. Kimura Zota, advisor of the Central Reserve Bank, held a discussion with Chinese newspaper reporters at 3:00 PM on the 5th on the third floor of the bank’s Shanghai branch, hoping that all sectors would cooperate to complete the mission of the national economy. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: Briefly stated, banks are of great importance to the people’s livelihood and bear very important responsibilities. Because the Central Reserve Bank is a government bank, its relationship to people’s livelihood is even more important. Now, in order to stabilize the currency, the Central Reserve Bank must be strengthened, so that the public has a deep belief in the Central Reserve Bank. The key points for strengthening the Central Reserve Bank are: (1) To ensure that the reserve for the issuance of banknotes is sufficient. (2) To make loans cautiously. Rumors that the Central Reserve Bank has no reserve are completely wrong. The Central Reserve Bank has long determined that there is sufficient reserve for the issuance of banknotes. The Central Reserve Bank’s lending target is absolutely not banks. Even for banks, loans can only be issued after a thorough review. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most people do not recognize the current situation, believing that it is caused by the issuance of currency. In fact, the current price increase is due to the scarcity of materials themselves. Therefore, in order to suppress prices, it is necessary to start by enriching the source of materials. To enrich the content of the Central Reserve Bank, the cooperation of all parties is necessary, and the understanding of the public is necessary in order to promote currency stability.</p>
<h3>After General Registration of Major Goods, Owners Can Still Buy, Sell, and Move Them, But Must Fill Out and Submit a Goods Movement Report</h3>
<p>In order to handle the regulations on the production, storage, movement, and distribution of materials, and in order to implement the wartime economic policies and the task of guiding and supervising the material control, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau is holding the General Registration of Major Goods in Shanghai Special City. The items include cotton, lump coal, coal briquettes, cigarette paper and other items stipulated in the list of major commodity categories and items promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and the twelve categories of materials stipulated in the new Articles on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement: (1) various automobiles and their parts, (2) gasoline and petroleum products for automobiles, (3) various machinery, (4) telecommunications equipment and materials (including parts and batteries), (5) metals (including silver yuan raw materials and non-ferrous metals) and their products, (6) medicines (referring to medical and industrial uses, excluding Chinese medicine) and dyes, (7) rubber (including old rubber) and products, (8) cotton yarn and cloth and their products, (9) candles (including raw materials), (10) matches, (11) soap, (12) sugar. In order to restrict these major items, regardless of whether they are members of various trade associations, they must all apply to the bureau for registration. Those who store the above-listed major items and conceal them or report less than they actually have will be severely punished once verified. The registration period was originally from April 5 to April 30. Now, because the various trade associations are in the process of adjusting their organizations, the members have not been able to complete the registration procedures on schedule. The requests of the various trade associations have been approved to extend the registration period by ten days, from May 1 to May 10. Now that the deadline is only a few days away, the number of businesses and companies that are declaring registration through trade associations, or private businesses that are directly applying to the Economic Bureau for registration of their stored goods, has been quite enthusiastic in recent days. It is understood that after the general registration of major goods, the goods stored by various companies, businesses, or private individuals who have registered with the bureau can be freely bought, sold, and moved. Holders of goods can obtain a Goods Movement Report from the bureau for sale or purchase of goods, and submit it with detailed information. The items listed in the Goods Movement Report include: (1) Mover (business name, manager's or owner's name, business address or owner's address, telephone number), (2) Moved items (registration number, item category, item name, trademark or brand name, item quantity and value), (3) Moving location (address of moving in and name of consignee, address of moving out and name of consignor), (4) Reason for moving (purpose of moving out and purpose of use, purpose of moving in and purpose of use), (5) Moving date. The report is submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau for approval, and a Goods Movement Report Receipt is issued to facilitate movement.</p>
<h3>Factories Resuming Operations One After Another; Smoke Coal Usage Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>With the assistance of the authorities, factories in the city are now resuming production in sequence, and the situation is very good. The required raw materials are also being fully obtained. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the use of smoke coal seems to be increasing sharply because factories in various industries have started production. Fortunately, this fuel is allocated by the authorities on a regular basis, so there is no fear of shortage. The market price is also low, which greatly benefits the manufacturing cost. At the same time, the authorities are actively purchasing the smoke coal needed by various factories in order to transport it to Shanghai for storage in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Attention to Material Conservation; Japanese Embassy Establishes Committee to Be Responsible for Wartime Key Resources</h3>
<p>In order to seek conservation of key resources and use materials only when necessary, the Japanese mainland has set wartime standards for important materials and unified the complex types of resources. The Shanghai Embassy Office recently received an order from the Greater East Asia Ministry to set wartime standards for important resources in Shanghai and to establish a wartime standards committee to be responsible for the key wartime resources. The director of the Economic Department, Okuda, also serves as the committee chairman.

<h3>Aspiration Chapter</h3>
<p>— Striving for Glory</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes, "Poverty diminishes one's aspirations." This saying indeed has profound meaning. Being poor is not necessarily a lifelong condition, therefore it should not be a source of shame, much less humiliation. Some people, born into wealthy families, often look down on others, treating the lives of the poor as if they were ants. Then there are those who fawn over their superiors and bully those below them, even though they themselves are just as destitute in spirit. Even apes know to sympathize with their own kind, so why should humans be any different? Who knows if a poor person, as long as their aspirations remain high, and their life's ambitions are yet to be realized, will endure humiliation, always keeping it firmly in mind. Once the situation changes dramatically, it often makes those haughty people feel ashamed and find no place to hide. Eventually, people will respect and praise them.</p>
<p>However, if a person is both poor and lacking in aspirations, then they will be poor for life. Their life is a dead life. In other words, they might as well not have come to Earth to suffer. Because their experience is only darkness and pain, their life will never see the light of day and will be rejected by humanity. It can be said that they are superfluous in the world, and they should quickly find a way to return to the path of death.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting aspirations is a key principle of life and the driving force for success. A person must set aspirations, and the reason for this lies in this principle.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Shanghai (3)</h3>
<p>— Hashimoto Kansetsu</p>
<p>In light of the frequency of Japan's interactions with foreign countries in ancient times, it can be known that the scope of China's interactions with foreign countries in ancient history was even more extensive. I once said that in the late Han Dynasty in China, foreign culture had already been introduced. Weren't the displaced people already immersed in foreign culture in even more ancient times? In the Meiji era, Mount Oe described Shuten-dōji as a person mixed with Russian blood. Legend has it that he liked to drink blood. In fact, the so-called blood drinking was probably wine! These statements cannot be dismissed with a laugh. Even in terms of geographical relationships, it is quite appropriate. The reason I say this is not to endorse Mount Oe's statement. For example, the story of the Peach Blossom Spring in Wuling is about people from the so-called Western Asia who were driven out by the tyrannical Qin and fled. This is not necessarily a far-fetched legend. I can't recite Tao Yuanming's "Peach Blossom Spring" now, but I only remember the words "the clothing of men and women was all like that of outsiders, with yellow hair hanging down." The so-called "yellow hair hanging down" is not just a description of unkempt hair, but can also be interpreted as yellow hair. In the excavations of the Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasties, people often find clay figurines with yellow hair.</p>
<p>The appearance of the people of Hunan, even today, is different from that of ordinary Chinese people. They have high noses, large eyes, and a fierce temperament. In ancient times, they lived in fertile land and were fond of bravery and fighting. (I forgot to mention above; people say that Li Taibai was from Longxi, but recently some people say that he was a Xianbei, that is, a Siberian.) Geographically speaking, going down the Yangtze River from Sichuan Province, Taoyuan (in Hunan Province, near Changde) is a suitable place to settle down. At the end of last year, the three-thousand-year-old record of the Peach Blossom Spring dream may have been blown away all at once. I can conclude that the Sino-Asian people, with the Republic of China as the embryo, had precedents for the creation of new culture two thousand years ago. I think this is definitely not an unreasonable question.</p>
<p>The fourth year after the Chinese Incident, the Greater East Asia War broke out. The Chinese people's feelings towards the Japanese people have been refreshed, which is truly gratifying. The prevalence of the Japanese language craze is even more deeply felt in the South. I think Japanese will soon become the Greater East Asian language and become popular in various places. Especially in China, the similarity of the characters is one of the reasons for the convenience. Another reason can be said to be due to utilitarian thinking, such as being able to quickly obtain a job if one understands Japanese. In trains and restaurants, although Japanese is not yet very popular, the meaning can probably be conveyed. However, I feel that the kind of sentiment I liked when I came to China seems to be gradually decreasing. Seeing the blue clothes of the farmers engaged in farming in the rape flowers outside the window from the train, I immediately thought of the completely Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Qian, who was traveling with me, "What happened to so many water buffalo? Why didn't I see any?" Mr. Qian replied, "They have all been eaten." When I got home and talked about this, the women all laughed. "The joke on the radio said that water buffalo have a watery smell." I also thought that maybe it wouldn't be like this. However, this is not a joke. In Shanghai, new restaurants and the like are springing up like mushrooms after a rain, much more than before, employing beautiful and lively waitresses, and every one is very lively. On the other hand, there seems to be a great lack of resources. Miss Zhou Lianxia has a poem about Shanghai describing this situation.</p>
<p>Describing the scene of waiting in the street for a long time to buy rice, this poem is now quite loved by some poets in Shanghai. There are also one or two poems that will be published in the weekly Asahi, which I will omit here. Everywhere, from the mouths of knowledgeable people, one can often hear remarks of understanding Japan and trusting Japan. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>"Everyone is very tired. We will arrive at XX soon."</p>
<p>This is what the Chinese conductor in the train said. Among them, there are also waitresses whose Japanese is more accurate than mine. (April 10th) (Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on April 23rd)</p>
<h3>### Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Shilin</p>
<p>Sympathy is the feeling that arises when the pain of others is reflected in one's own heart as reality. We believe that all the isolation, conflict, and harm in human society can be remedied with sympathy. There are many people in the world who cannot understand the pain of others, and there are even people who oppose it and take pleasure in the pain of others. Only because of this, the world is full of disasters. Small family disputes, large social unrest, and racial hatred are all caused by a lack of sympathy. Confucius' so-called "benevolence," Sakyamuni's so-called "compassion," and Jesus's so-called "universal love," which one is not based on sympathy?</p>
<p>All those who have sympathy can forgive others. Theft, in the eyes of stubborn moralists, is originally something that can be deeply hated; but there are also reasons for theft, perhaps due to poverty, perhaps due to lack of education, perhaps due to heredity and companionship, or perhaps due to the instability of the entire society. If we examine the reasons why he became a thief, we feel that although theft is evil, there is really a place for compassion and sympathy, and we cannot simply use shallow moral views to blindly hate it deeply. However, forgiving others is the passive aspect of sympathy, and sympathy also has an active aspect. Those who have sympathy can not only forgive the evils of the world, but also create merit and eliminate the evils of the world. Because they sympathize with the poor status of women and laborers, they want to advocate social reform; because they sympathize with the suffering of ignorant villagers, they want to work hard to promote popular education. Sympathy can not only love everyone, but also hate people's sympathy. Confucius said in his later years: "Only the benevolent can love people and hate people." Like those speculators who hoard and drive up prices, endangering the stability of people's livelihoods. In order to eradicate this poison, society must have a style of breaking through personal relationships, and the government must have a spirit of righteousness to destroy relatives, severely punish treacherous and stubborn people, and warn the public. Because those who are rich in sympathy originally envisioned "the greatest happiness for the greatest number"! These can be said to be manifestations of active sympathy.</p>
<p>Our country's people have always been bound by the concept of family, and as a result, the scope of sympathy has been limited. Outside the family, there is a lack of ability to combine and know morality. In our country, besides the family and relatives who have close ties with the family, all others are the so-called "outsiders." Among these people who are "outsiders" to each other, there is of course no social unity to speak of, and the scope of sympathy must be greatly expanded!</p>
<h3>On Habit</h3>
<p>— Bu Jian</p>
<p>"Habit" seems to be the most common custom, and therefore, it is often the most easily ignored and despised by most people. It not only has good and bad distinctions, but also has a positive significance, which can directly affect the success or failure of a person's life and career.</p>
<p>Gambling, visiting prostitutes, alcoholism, addiction to smoking... are bad habits: they can tempt people to tend to be depressed, downcast, decadent, degenerate... not only harm people, ruin families, damage health, but also break human relationships and bury their future. That is already known to everyone.</p>
<p>Conversely, good habits are also an excellent condition for success and career achievement, such as getting up early, regulating diet, and regular bowel movements... it is beneficial to health. Good reading and diligent study can increase knowledge and actively promote careers. Cautious speech and harmony can make extensive friendships and deepen affection...</p>
<p>But regardless of whether it is a good or bad habit, its formation is by no means accidental, and there are reasons for it; nor is it a temporary bad habit, mostly caused by greed for temporary fun and licentiousness, unconsciously. Interest and hobbies are certainly a reason for good habits, but most of them are still consciously cultivated. Therefore, every time one first learns, one often feels infinite difficulty and pain, but over time it becomes natural—habitual. At that time</p>
<h3>Desire</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yunfu</p>
<p>Desire and life have a close relationship. As long as a person is born, desire follows, so there will never be a person in the world who has no desire at all. Because if a person wants to live, he must have various material needs such as food and clothing. With these material needs, he has to change his mind and use his brain. Whether it is a dying old man or the cry of a baby just out of the womb; according to the research results of psychologists, it is also a manifestation of desire, not to mention the poor people who have various material worries, even those big merchants who have made a fortune after hoarding and speculating, still turn the idea of ​​money, and even those monks who think they are pure-hearted and desireless also have the delusion of enjoying happiness in heaven. So, in a thousand words, in short, a person is finished when he dies, but if he does not die, he will eventually be entangled by various desires.</p>
<p>Human desires vary depending on each person's different environment. But these infinite desires often produce adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Although desire can cause various evils, it also has various benefits on the other hand. If human beings had no desires, they could not progress. Only with desire can one overcome all difficult encounters.</p>
<h3>Devil</h3>
<p>— Xu Zheng Yang</p>
<p>It wears the new mask of charity and the old clothes of morality; and often shakes its head and sighs:</p>
<p>"Alas! Alas! The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not what they used to be!"</p>
<p>So, many people kneel down, worship it, bless it, and praise it...</p>
<p>After that, it took off its mask, took off its clothes, grabbed many people who knelt down to it, stepped on them, pulled out their tendons, peeled their skin, sucked their blood, and chewed their flesh. Many people groaned until they turned into many skulls.</p>
<p>He finally put on his clothes and mask again; and drew a mourning "face of compassion" on the mask, and then looked at these skulls and sighed with pity.</p>
<p>"Alas, alas! Alas, how painful!"</p>
<p>So, many skulls knelt down, worshiped him, blessed him, praised him, and thanked him...</p>
