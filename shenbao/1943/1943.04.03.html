<p>社評</p>
<h3>生產·限價與物價問題</h3>
<p>物價問題，還是目前最嚴重的問題，大家都爲着這個問題而焦慮。就最近的趙勢而言，糧價是跌了，而別種物價一部分還在漲，幾年來爲了物價高漲而成了「驚弓之烏」的大衆門，心弦上籠罩着「糧價也許就要回漲」的暗影，其實，大可不必顧慮這一點，我們應該研究如何制止一部分物價上漲的辦法，才是有意義的出路。</p>
<p>這裏所可提出的辦法，仍將側重於「限價」。限價較之平價進了一步，平價是以經濟的力量來穩定物價；而限價則是以政治的力量來抑平物價的。作爲治標的辦法來看，這是會使人加以重視的，但如果要使物價能實實在在平穩下去，當然應有更努力。只有解決了物價上漲的因素之後，限價才能馬到成功。要不然，在生產减給貧困的狀况之下，生產者和商人會採用消極的態度，把物品化整爲零的掩藏起那時間，無須命令，買賣就會走上停止的田地了。歷史的敎訓是如此，事實的邏輯亦會如此，這在實施限價時不可不注意的。</p>
<p>措理物價問題，如同措理其他問題一樣，應當淸淸楚楚的認識客觀環境。如巢中國是一個高度的資本主義國家，是一個生產集中的國家，那麼，問題就比較容易措理了。只要把爲數不多的幾個大生產機關管制一下就行。無如中國的經濟狀况不是這樣。現代工業的生產旣是分散，又是貧弱得很可憐。在這個小商品生產佔優勢的社會中，只有誘導他們，資助他們，激勵他們去生產。如果限制得過度，會把他們的生產情緒及能力降低。反過來說，如果我們能實實在在扶助他們，使他們大量提高其生產，則物品的供給，一定會大大增加。供給如果增加，則限價自然會發生效力了。</p>
<p>要提高生產，就必須取消一切生產上的障礙，進一步就須解決工業生產的資金問題。當前最困難的一點，是囤積的「利潤超過銀行的「利率」，而銀行的利率，有時也超過工業生產的利潤（如果不兼營囤貨的話），大勢所趨，游資便瘋狂的流入囤積之一途了。因此，當前的要務，是在於抑低商業利潤和保證工業利潤。這樣會促使資金大量流入生產。只要我們能嚴格制裁囤積居奇，能實實在在抑低商業利潤，則生產增加了，限價不是更有效力嗎？</p>
<p>其次，要說到物價與幣值的關係了。通之速度　發，不可避免地會使物價上漲。因此，在擔理物價時，萬萬不能看輕這個問題。假定生產額與發行額以剪刀形的姿態發展，物價是無法靜止不動的。因此我們必須穩定幣値，必須緊縮通貨的發行額。第一，爲了穩定幣値，不但要設法收回來，而且要設法發得少。這裏就要裁撤駢枝，緊縮不必要的開支。第二，由於種種辦法收回來的通貨，必須使其流入生產領域，否則工業仍鬧資金枯竭，週轉不靈，生產是無法增加的。</p>
<p>我們討論物價問題，通貨與物資兩方，都可不必互相比重和推諉，在物價上漲的初期，一面由於通貨膨脹，另一面也由於物資缺乏，到了現在，則大部分癥結，在於一般人的心理恐慌，遂造成漲價賽跑的現象。所以，安定人心爲第一要着。物價行政的對象，大部分爲市民，市民最富敏感，最不能蒙頭蓋面，况且開門七件事，人人需要，即使不發表物價指數，但每個人的生活經騐，必能記憶物價的趨勢。只有公開討論，以大義利害來曉喻大衆，才可消滅一般心理恐慌。</p>
<p>只有從這些根本的問題上着眼，限價才可以收到其應有的效果。因此，我們必須努力於緊縮通貨；努力於扶助生產，和取消一切生產上的阻礙；努力於嚴禁囤積居奇；努力於消滅一般心理恐慌。這雖屬老生常談，然而畢竟是解決物資物價問題所應取的途徑。</p>

<h3>反軸心陣線的內訌及　德國夏季攻勢的前瞻</h3>
<p>（里斯本特電二十四日發）　歐洲的德蘇戰綫，因德國開始反攻，故蘇聯的攻勢遭受頓挫，兩軍今正各整理其戰綫，以迎最後的決戰。突尼西亞戰綫，英第八軍已開始進攻，而其歸趨亦漸明瞭。一面在政治上，英國外相艾登飛美，調整步調錯亂的反軸心陣營內部，對未來二三個月中世界戰局的推移，恐將有開戰以來最重大的影響。朝日新聞社里斯本支局與阿根廷京城的支局，最近乘兩地間國際電話開通的機會，於二十四日隔大西洋交換意見，互相探詢這重大時機所內蘊的真相如左：</p>
<p>茂木里斯本支局長—希特勒與邱吉爾偶然同在二十一日發表演說，在種種意義上，提供了富有興味的問題。</p>
<p>今并阿根廷京城支局長—邱吉爾的演說，並涉及艾登訪美的目的，透露英國人民對戰後世界將取何方向與形式所懷抱的希望·爲撫慰蘇聯的不平及失望，邱吉爾強調英·美·蘇三國將爲戰後世界的支配者，說明蘇聯在建設新世界上所負的重大任務，並發表使蘇聯滿意的戰後四年計劃，總之，這不過是對付蘇聯的一種姿態，而邱吉爾所述的政治見解，乃是陳舊的集團保障的思想，這也不過是第一次世界大戰後協約國舉其全力創設而終告失敗的重演而已。這樣空洞的東西，顯然不能撫慰蘇聯深刻的不滿。</p>
<p>茂木—是的，蘇聯看來，無論多少在口頭上說的好聽的戰後約束，不如英美時在歐洲登陸的問題來的切實，處理戰後問題的集團保障，國際聯盟，終將轉過其矛鋒而復成反蘇同盟，故蘇聯甯願擺脫英美的現實的約束。</p>
<p>今井—例如蘇聯的冀求領有波蘭舊國境綫，菠羅的海三國，芬蘭灣的哈恩開島，其主旨在於確保將來戰爭中實際上有重大任務的戰略地點，所以蘇聯的外交遠較英美爲更注重於現實。</p>
<p>茂木—蘇聯的這一勢力範圍圈，在理論上，英國一部份人士殆亦正式承認。可是在實際上却成爲問題。例如最近蘇聯，波蘭國境交涉的失敗，美國目不必說，即英國亦視爲蘇聯的妄想，決不使蘇聯的如願以價。</p>
<p>今井—蘇聯現在一手担任反軸心軍的重任，爲英美而戰的意識，始終無從擺脫。可是英美爲了使蘇聯繼續現在的戰爭，不能不屈從蘇聯對新領土之現實的要求。</p>
<p>茂木—美國副總統華萊斯對蘇協力的演說以後，英美支配層對蘇的期望，與英國仍斡旋於美蘇之間，保持原有的地位，此在艾登訪美之先，即已知道。而對於美國的帝國主義的野心，英國亦視爲與蘇聯的伸張勢力同爲一丘之貉，故極力加以抑制。艾登在滯留華盛頓的時候，据三月八日泰晤士報的論說所述，英美的抗爭，乃是英·美·蘇的關係立於互相猜忌的心理上所致。該論說論及戰後歐洲的保障，祗有蘇聯具有保障歐洲的實力，故應承認其優先的地位。英國因其原有的對歐洲的地位及政策的傳統上，自然也是一個主角。美國對於歐洲的問題並沒有直接關聯，故應由介於　美二大陸間的英國決定一切。這唯我獨尊的主張，當然刺激美國。此次邱吉爾的演說，即是想對這種見解加以修正的意思。</p>
<p>茂木—有人疑惑這論說或許是艾登所寫的，但這似乎是多餘的問題，艾登自身業已聲明這論說並不代表任何英國官方的見解。美國國內的反蘇，反英的空氣，英國報紙大加煊染，据最近幾星期來的情形，這趨勢似有相當的根據。每日郵報的華盛頓特派員稱：</p>
<p>「最近美國不贊成孤立主義的另一派人士，漸佔勢力，他們要求佔領軍事根據地，建設龐大的國防軍。美國民眾的空氣，遠較英國爲緊張。總之，美國現在正進行其露骨的帝國主義。」</p>
<p>英國的經濟，現在正極猛烈的在趨向國家社會主義化的過程中。本年初頭軍需生產大臣李滋特頓的提案中所說的生產集中主義，實在就是軍需生產第一主義，所以政府的企業統制力極度加強。</p>
<p>根據上述方針，英國現在最注重的是飛機及其部分品，船舶，對潛水艦防禦裝置，三種生產部門。新的勞働力以及剩餘勞働力的百分之九十就是集中於以上三部門。</p>
<p>今井—反軸心陣營內，重慶的地位最爲可憐。邱吉爾的演說中，把重慶一腳踢開。他說：現在的戰局，英美蘇三國立於指導的地位，來年，或再來年，須在歐洲獲得勝利以後，方才援助重慶。重慶是英美陣營中的繼子。與汪主席和日本在共同戰綫所擔任的重要任務比起來，重慶在反軸心陣營所佔的地位格外顯得可衰。</p>
<p>茂木——這一點英美的看法也略有不同。英國並不把重慶視爲等於零的問題，但美國祗因直接在太平洋上對付日本而始表面上敷衍重慶。英國方面，最近因爲緬甸戰綫的慘敗，故極不高興，對重慶軍似無多大的希望。（未完）</p>
<h3>中日經濟界座談會（一）大陸新報會同本報召集</h3>
<p>出席者</p>
<p>日本方面</p>
<p>青木節　商工會議所主席</p>
<p>武內文彬　商工會議所理事</p>
<p>栗本寅治　瀛華洋行常務董事</p>

<p>許長卿　本報特約撰述　交通銀行人事管理室主任</p>
<p>陳彬龢　本報</p>
<p>陳彬龢先生：今天申報得能和大陸新報聯合舉行這個座談會，實在是一件幸事。承蒙日本方面經濟界諸位領袖及我國經濟界權威參加，尤甚引爲榮幸，應該表示深切的謝意的。</p>
<p>尾坂先生：今天晚上奉屈諸位先生在百忙之中駕臨，非常抱歉，同事也覺得非常榮幸。座談會是有種種形式的，鄙人很知道今天出席的諸位先生，都是飽有經驗的。不過我在這裏想要特加申說的，乃是報館的聯合舉行座談會，大概要算我們這次的座談會是破天荒的創舉；同時，日本和中國兩方歸來聯合舉行，也要首推我們這次座談會開了一個空前的先河。　座談會的結果，在日文報方面，將由大陸新報發表；在中文報方面，將由申報和新申報同時揭載。前幾天在新聞聯合會席上，曾舉行着關於中日兩方面提携同進的協議，這次的座談會，就是那次協議中決定要首先實行者，靠着陳君熱誠的屬望，方才成爲事實，終於在今天勞駕諸位。歷史悠久的申報，和年紀很輕的大陸新報，能夠一塊兒開頭做這件事，是非常光榮的。又本日的座談會，想請武內君來主持進行，現在就請武內君做主席發言吧！</p>
<p>武內先生：由鄙人來做主席，那是很僭越的，可不知應該怎樣進行才好？實在覺得有點慌。今天報上登載着收買配給機構的問題，我以爲倒是個剛好的機會。這收買配給機構的問題，我以爲本身乃是一月九日發表的那個大家都感到非常愉快之日華外交政策轉換的事實，表現於經濟上的第一樁事情。同時爲今後日華經濟合作的一個最重要的起點。對於這個關係，先請李先生發抒卓見。</p>
<p>討論題目</p>
<p>（一）日本對華新政策轉變後，以上海爲中心之中日經濟合作的新方向。</p>
<p>（二）當前物價問題之對策。</p>
<p>（三）上海工業之復興，增加生產問題。</p>
<p>（四）上海華股買賣，與證券交易所問題。</p>
<p>（五）對於設立全國商業統制總會，與緩和物資移動限制之意見。</p>
<p>李權時先生：（一）須先從事實上表現真實的平等合作，以謀共存共榮之　精神。一方面緩和上海與外埠物資移動之限制，一方面設立全國商業統制總會以協助政府施行國策。此二端欲其圓滑進行，自有待於友邦方面人士之誠意合作，不憧憬於過去數年之獨佔利益。</p>
<p>（二）當前物價問題之主要對策有二：一即增加物資之供給或生產，一即安定人民對通貨之不安與恐慌心理。欲祛除人民對中儲券之不安心理，必須使人民相信軸心國之必獲最後勝利，與東亞及世界新秩序之必能建立，而且以鐵的事實證明之，使造謠惑眾之投機囤戶無所施其技。設能嚴厲公平的搜購囤貨，全面配給與消費者，自更能獲得低物價政策之美滿結果。</p>
<p>（三）欲上海工業之復興與生產之增加，必須先疏通原料之來源，上海工業復興之起點在紡織業，故必須先疏通棉花之來源。欲疏通棉花來源，必須先以上海之日用工業品如棉紗，棉布，香烟，火柴，洋燭，肥皂，砂糖等以低價售與棉農。最近華中棉花統制會爲救濟內地棉農生活深受投機商人威脅，擬以公定價格之棉紗布及五洋等大量配給棉農，以安定其生活，並期棉花收買數量之增大，可謂實獲我心。果能如此順利進行，則上海紡織業不難從速復興，而其他工業亦得連帶復興，增加生產。再以廉價之工業品交換農村之低價農產品，如此，內外相維，城鄉相助，則民生自能安定，後方自能鞏固矣。</p>
<p>（四）上海華股買賣與證券交易所，不妨准其復業，但以不投機賭博，刺激其他物價上漲爲條件。</p>
<p>（五）自全國商業統制總會暫行條例披露於報端之後，一般中日商人頗多疑懼，以爲此後他們的活動將被束縛至最小範圍，甚至於無，此則實爲杞憂。蓄暫行條例第五條明明規定「全國商業統制總會以不直接經營物資之買賣爲原則，……未經加入全國商業統制總會之商業團體，不得取統制物資之配給」也。由此可知此後商人之活動雖大受限制，然並未完全停止，不過在新辦法之下，其利潤自不能再如過去之優厚耳。戰時痛苦，人人應受，且須平均，斷不許再讓少數投機囤商，乘機圖暴和發戰財。故平心而論，中日商人對此新辦法實無甚怨言之可言。</p>
<p>武內先生：這個問題，也是從日本對華政策的大轉變而來的。唯其是這樣，對於商業統制會今後的運營，其所期待，是非常之大的。對於這政策轉變，和以上海爲中心的中日經濟合作的新方向，和李先生所談及的諸問題，現在請日本方面青木先生，發表意見。</p>
<p>青木先生：據我的觀察，中國和日本亘續七年之久的戰爭，不是要告終了嗎？就是日本爲着中國，把一切任之中國的經濟人並中國的政府。如租界的交還，治外法權的撤廢等，爲事變以前所熱切待望着的，概提供給國民政府，日本的道義的精神，是這樣切實明白地表示出來。並且，日本對於實行這些事項，極力盡瘁從事。日本的意圖，要在使得中國整備國內體制的希冀。所調使得中國國體制的整備，是日本始終不渝的政策。日本對於中國的獨立性的非常熱心，有時竟致中國方面的誤會。那不是中國事變勃發之所由嗎？現在日本，爲了解放亞細亞民族之故，不恤對於英美宣戰。中國也遵奉了孫中山先生的亞細亞民族主義而宣言參戰。在看了這個環境的時候，使我不由地忘記了中日之間有着什麽爭端呢？日本的政策，今後確信無非在援助中國國內體制的整備。如今天所發表的物資收買配給問題，並移動限制的撤廢，也是其實行的一例。明白地說來，中國國內體制的整備，在使中國的經濟人和政治家作爲自己的責任而加以完成而日本對之，衷心與以援助。由着這個見解說，中國的經濟人和政治家，至少第一步先要專志於怎樣使現在和平地區的經濟機動圓滑，使國民安樂地生活下去的力策；其次，使重慶政權所管轄的地區，也被其影響，俾中國全　的整備，日趨於確立。</p>
<p>到現在，無論怎麼說，爲了日本在中國有着戰爭行爲，或是日本雖所不欲，爲着作戰上的不得已有着不能盡如中國方面各方意向之點。這是出於日本在戰爭行爲上所迫不獲已的緣故。這點，是要請中國各位諒解的。因着國民政府的參戰，爲了亞細亞民族，東方的兩大獨立國對於世界宣戰，我們完全抱着同一的信念，向着亞細亞民族同生共榮的路上突進。就是，日本在日本應盡的職務範圍之內，中國在中國應盡的職務範圍之內，兩國互相地，入於整備參戰體制的時代。</p>
<p>如前所述，日本對於中國的政策，無非在希冀中國做着東方獨立國而爲可觀的發展。因之，日本這回所行的，不過把前此所懷抱的政策，付諸實施罷了。今後中國方面，應該把日本的道義心，毫不遲疑地領受，向着可期爲東方獨立國而進展的一切國民體制的整備上進行。這點，第一在企圖經濟動態的調整。就是要拿在平常靜態的經濟狀態中，使得中國的國民生活安定爲第一着眼點。爲了實行這個政策，必須要中國財界的各方面，一致向於這個大目的努力。對之，我們日本的經濟人，也極願和諸位提携，努力於日本對中國貿易關係的確立。如果把現在日本所解放給中國的一切，只爲一局部的經濟人之利益行爲所利用，而不用之於這中國國內體制的緊急時設施的巨大目的上，那簡直是中國自己把自己滅亡！這點，中國的經濟人，新聞界和政治家們，都要念念不忘於中國的存立，念念不忘中國和日本的同船合命以對付他們的歐美人。只須在這個根本問題上，切實地認清就夠；其他枝節末梢的事情，中國對於日本人的所爲，或是日本人對於中國人的所爲，相互間容由不平不滿，也就無關宏旨了。</p>
<p>可是，這些在穩健的中國經濟人和穩健的日本經濟人，若是真實地認識這些時局，一定能夠完全加以矯正的。像這樣種種的相尅面，必須由着互相諒解而掃除淨盡，而唯一臨戰體制的樹立是務。我們日本方面的經濟人，一心一意地對於這次日本政府所爲的措置，切祝中國的完全成功。而中國的國民。對於因此而獲得那樣善良的政治的施行，那樣善良的經濟的進動，將要同然一辭地加以贊譽，是可以期待的。又我們日本經濟人，對之是有着衷心加以援助的準備的。由着這樣的心意，今後便是有着種種問題發生，中國的經濟人和日本的經濟人，必定能夠互相信賴不疑，在正實的道義之上，與以解決。</p>

<p>上海市貧病救濟協會的成立，發起諸君的動機，當亦本乎上述的義務，可於該會的命名上推想而知。該會於去年夏初成立後，主持辦理急救時疫，施診，給藥，施衣，施粥等項工作，而以不直接舉辦，盡力資助已成慈善團體爲方針。會內負責人員均屬熱心公正。悉盡義務，尤於審核稽察，非常嚴格認眞，不浪費分毫，取之社會一分，用之社會一分。這種辦事精神，的確値得稱道和欽敬。</p>
<p>不過，細閱捐款的總數，以與上海的人數來比較，則毌寗說是失敗的，也就直接影響於救濟力量的微薄。我們再一看南京路上新開的某大飯店餐廳，一個月的營業，就有一百廿萬元。眞是一席數千金。如果把這兩件事比照一下，就顯出社會上奢華和慳吝的眞面相。「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」，在這裏證實了。</p>
<p>目前時令，很快的夏季到了，我們亟盼該會不要爲爲消極的結束打算，而爲積極的繼續努力。在拯救貧病的慈願之下，相信該會負責諸君子的寬大朐懷，決不使這一工作中輟的。</p>
<p>今天本報以第四第五兩版的篇幅，特載這一篇「上海市貧病救濟協會救濟工作槪况」的長文，而將自由談暫停，也就表示擁護這一社會事業的微忱，請讀者諒解。這篇文字雖則偏於人名和數字的報吿，可是從這裏可以測騐各界人士對於社會事業贊助的尺度，所以盼望讀者細細的讀竟。</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>市財政局頃據密報，有不法之徒，假借該局名義勒索水陸運輸，及醃臘等稅，查該局並無是項稅則，顯係奸宄宵小巧立名目，殊屬不法之極，故通令查禁外，並令各該業注意，如有不法之徒，膽敢冒收，當報該局，予以嚴厲懲辦。</p>
<h3>評言　論物價</h3>
<p>三月十二日起，友邦日本當局，爲尊重我國主權起見，特將人國物資統制權交還我國，俾得完成獨立自主，而我國當局爲統制物資，集中配給，藉以調整物價，乃有全國商業統制總會之設立；該會將成爲劃時代之經濟統制最高機關，自不待言．惟關於澈底調整物價問題，尚有不得已於一言者．</p>
<p>最近日用必需品之價格，因當局採取嚴格之統制與配給，一部份似有轉趨下游之勢，白米黑市，即其一例．但糧食旣爲物價問題之中心，何以大多數日用必需品之價格，較諸月前仍覺有增無减？此中癥結，得略論之：自事實上言，各業零售商物品售價，必須根據批發商之所開價格，而批發商則根據廠商之所謂「廠盤」．故澈底調整物價之治本辦法，在於統「盤」籌劃；對於廠商之成本（包括原料）以及開支等等，予以最合理的計算，然後依據此項計算，定爲最合理的價格，使批發商與零售商無由藉口，無從抬價，同時，並當從速制裁批發商與零售商之逐步抬價，嚴格限制任何一人之逾量收買，是爲治標之法．爲釜底抽薪之計，治本誠重於治標，然治標與治本，固當相輔而行．</p>
<h3>市區各晨業機關　將劃歸糧食局管轄</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　市糧食局正式改組成立後，該局內部機構及人事配備，均經分別調整，頃據記者探悉，該局第一二三科負責推進該局行政工作，每科下設置兩股外，秘書室下設置文書庶務會計三股，糧食配給處第一組設調節配證採購三股，第二組設公糶倉儲運輸三股，第三組設食糖油雜糧等三股，並聞市區東溝農林試騐東溝農業改進區暨眞茹農業改進區等，以事關農業增產事宜，是以亦將劃歸該局掌管，俾資從事督導，增進市區農業生產云．</p>
<h3>商統總會　截止紗布登記　今日爲最後一天</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　全國商業統制總會，辦理棉紗布存貨登記，係委託紗廠聯合會，紗業公會，棉布業公會，染織業公會，原規定以三月三十一日截止，及日本上海商工會議所代辦登記，旋准華商方面各會會聯名函稱，以請求人數一時過多不克依限辦理完竣，請展限三日，故爲顧全持有者利害起見，特將存貨登記日期展延至今（三）日下午四時爲止，逾限槪不再展，故登記日期，尚有今日一天，希各紗布持有者，趕速前往指定各機關辦理，登記手續，切勿觀望自誤云．</p>
<h3>本市金融權威解說　中儲聯銀滙兌率</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　頃據記者昨日向本市金融界權威方面探詢，聯銀券與中儲券兌換比率情形，承吿實質上臺無問題．今（即二日）日市情高漲之勢不無商民不明瞭種種原因，而受一般操縱市儈之煽惑而自擾之．蓋以軍票與聯銀券係特別圓一種連繫關係，故在華北方面軍票與聯銀券等價流通，現軍票旣在華中華南停止新發行，華北與華中華南通貨兌換當以聯銀券與中儲券爲兌換單位，實質上中儲券在華中華南價値無任何之變化，即對華北方面亦無差値，其中種種階段，仍以物資運銷圓滑爲主，况聯銀券迄未在華中華南爲購買物資媒介，故中儲券對聯銀券僅爲直接兌換關係，而無實質之抵觸，如果無投機者操縱之引誘，在正當商業之思想，實無動盪之理。</p>
<h3>今日起各行荘　休假三天</h3>
<p>今（三）日爲春假節，本市各銀行錢荘循例自三日起休業春假三天，四日適逢星期例假，故於六日補假一天，七日起照常營業，聞全國商業統制總會物資移動許可事務所，亦於今（三）日停止辦公一天</p>

<h3>上月本市工商業　較前兩月發達</h3>
<p>茲悉本市工商業於上月（三月）份間新開業者，計有銀行十八家，錢荘十家，物產企業公司二家，百貨公司一家，醃臘行兩家，酒菜館一家，共計四十七家，此外尚有復業者兩家。</p>
<p>上月工商業較發達</p>
<p>停業者一爲電池工廠，一爲錢荘，又在上月份中開創立會之行荘企業，共計九家，此項開業與創業之情形，若與一二月份相較，則上月份顯較發達，按一月份中新開之銀行爲二家，錢荘七家，保險公司及企業公司共八家，二月份中新開之銀行十五家，錢荘十家，保險及企業公司十家。</p>
<p>發展情況已達高峰　惟上月份中之新開銀行錢荘企業等，大都係在上半個月之時期中，下半個月新開之銀行錢荘等爲數甚少，故本市工商業之民展情形，在上月份上旬中已達高潮云。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>

<h3>關於商業統制實施之商榷（三）</h3>
<p>— 高懋勳</p>
<p>（四）杜絕廠單之買賣　上述棧單，足以促成投機，助長囤積，破壞統制，此爲出貨後之情形，若在出貨之前，更有向廠商定購音品，由廠商付以廠單者，此種廠單之簽發，使廠商有機爲少於實際的出貨記帳，同時復可移轉買賣其投機囤積破壞統制，與棧單實有異曲同工之妙，故欲統制物資，除實行管理倉庫外，更須杜絕廠單之買賣，夫建立統馭的永久盤存制度，所以爲物資數字上之統制，管理倉庫及杜絕廠單買賣，則爲物資實體上之統制，二者如影之隨形，不可偏廢，　茍能同時兼施，則操縱囤積，自無所施其技矣。</p>
<p>以上所言，在目前事實上或有難行之處。其故有二：（一）人才不易羅致，（二）人情不易擯絕，就第一點言之，目前高級統計會計人才，較事變前更爲缺乏，應即多方綱羅，專司擊劃及指導實施之責，至從　機械工作這低級人員，則可招致若干曾習統計會計及略有倉庫經騐之學生，予以短期之訓練，即可任用。就第二點言之，瞻徇私誼，不肯執法，爲吾國國民之通病，故以商人自治的方式，辦理統制，此點最爲可慮。鄙意此種觀念，如不能毅然破除，則與統制之精神，根本違反，蓋統制之對象爲物資，受統制者爲商爲民，感不便者爲商，而引領望得福利者則爲民，利民即所以福國，此乃實施統制之最高目標，昔人有言，一家哭何如一路哭，明乎此方足以言統制，本此而論，統制，必須以學理爲依據，以法令爲範疇，設若雜以個人利害之觀念，狹義之同情，避難就易，以求迎合積重之心理，而徒側重於許可證之簽發，似失統制經濟之本意，倘能因不佞此文，而引起主持當局之考慮，學術專家之研討，作進一步之商榷，俾得建立强有力之統制經濟方式，固不僅學術之幸，抑亦國民之驅也。（完）</p>

<h3>Production, Price Controls, and the Problem of Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The issue of commodity prices remains the most pressing problem, causing anxiety for everyone. Regarding recent trends, grain prices have fallen, but the prices of other commodities continue to rise in part. The general public, having become "birds startled by the twang of a bow" due to years of soaring prices, is shadowed by the concern that "grain prices might rebound." However, there is no need to worry about this point. We should instead investigate ways to prevent the rise in the prices of other commodities, as that is the meaningful way forward.</p>
<p>The proposed solution here will still focus on "price controls." Price controls are a step beyond price stabilization. Price stabilization uses economic forces to stabilize prices, while price controls use political power to suppress prices. As a stopgap measure, this is worth considering, but if we want to truly stabilize commodity prices, greater effort is needed. Only after solving the factors driving up prices can price controls be truly effective. Otherwise, with production reduced and poverty rampant, producers and merchants will adopt a passive attitude, hiding goods piecemeal over time. Without any orders, trade will grind to a halt. This is the lesson of history, and the logic of reality. This must be considered when implementing price controls.</p>
<p>Addressing the issue of commodity prices, like addressing any other issue, requires a clear understanding of the objective environment. If China were a highly capitalist country, a country with concentrated production, the problem would be easier to address. It would only require regulating a small number of major production entities. Unfortunately, China's economic situation is not like that. Modern industrial production is both dispersed and pitifully weak. In this society dominated by small-scale commodity production, we can only guide, assist, and encourage them to produce. Excessive restrictions would reduce their motivation and ability to produce. Conversely, if we can genuinely support them and enable them to greatly increase their production, the supply of goods will surely increase significantly. If supply increases, then price controls will naturally be effective.</p>
<p>To increase production, we must eliminate all obstacles to production, and further, solve the problem of funding for industrial production. Currently, the most difficult point is that the "profit from hoarding" exceeds the "interest rate of banks," and the interest rate of banks sometimes exceeds the profit of industrial production (if not combined with hoarding). As a result, speculative capital flows madly into hoarding. Therefore, the current priority is to suppress commercial profits and guarantee industrial profits. This will encourage a large amount of capital to flow into production. If we can strictly punish hoarding and genuinely suppress commercial profits, then with increased production, wouldn't price controls be more effective?</p>
<p>Next, we must discuss the relationship between commodity prices and currency value. Uncontrolled currency issuance inevitably leads to inflation. Therefore, when managing commodity prices, we must not underestimate this problem. Assuming that production and issuance develop in a scissors-like fashion, commodity prices cannot remain stable. Therefore, we must stabilize the currency value and reduce the amount of currency issued. First, to stabilize the currency value, we must not only find ways to withdraw currency but also find ways to issue less. This requires cutting unnecessary branches and reducing unnecessary expenses. Second, the currency withdrawn through various means must be channeled into the production sector. Otherwise, industry will still suffer from a shortage of funds, hindering turnover and making it impossible to increase production.</p>
<p>When discussing the problem of commodity prices, both currency and materials need not be compared or evaded. In the early stages of inflation, it is partly due to currency inflation and partly due to a lack of materials. Now, however, the majority of the problem lies in the general public's psychological panic, resulting in a price increase race. Therefore, calming the public's mind is the top priority. The target of commodity price administration is mostly the citizens, who are most sensitive and cannot be kept in the dark. Moreover, the seven necessities of daily life are needed by everyone. Even without publishing a commodity price index, everyone's life experience will allow them to remember the trend of commodity prices. Only through open discussion and explaining the greater good and harm to the public can we eliminate general psychological panic.</p>
<p>Only by focusing on these fundamental issues can price controls achieve their intended effect. Therefore, we must strive to reduce currency issuance, strive to support production and eliminate all obstacles to production, strive to strictly prohibit hoarding, and strive to eliminate general psychological panic. This may be a cliché, but it is ultimately the path to solving the problem of material and commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Visits Manchurian Premier to Exchange Views on Japan-Manchuria Cooperation, Significant for Wartime Operations</h3>
<p>Shinkyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo visited Premier Zhang of the Manchurian State Council and other key figures of the Manchurian government this afternoon (2nd) to congratulate them on the ten years of development since the founding of Manchuria and to express his gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tojo also had an in-depth discussion with Premier Zhang in the Premier's office, exchanging candid opinions on various issues between Japan and Manchuria. It is acknowledged that this meeting has far-reaching significance in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, including Manchuria's future cooperation with Japan and Japan's assistance to Manchuria. Previously, Prime Minister Tojo visited the friendly nation of China and held important talks with Chairman Wang. Now, he has met with Manchurian Premier Zhang. Therefore, the meetings of the three major leaders of China, Japan, and Manchuria have been held individually. This will inevitably have a significant effect on the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the completion of the operation to defeat Britain and the United States, and is therefore worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>President Wang Hosts Banquet for Japanese Community Representatives</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - President of the Executive Yuan Wang, also serving as the president, held a banquet for Japanese community representatives at the International Club at 7 PM on the 1st. The Japanese community representatives included Councilor Maeda, the heads of various sections of the Civil Council and Civil Groups, President Sato of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President of the Veterans Association, medical doctors Tsuchiya and Umeda, representatives of various schools, representatives of various groups, and heads of various districts. Also in attendance were Consul General Soketake and consular officials, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei, Mayor of Nanjing Zhou Xuechang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang, and Secretary General of the Municipal Government Lu Shanzhi. During the banquet, President Wang gave a heartfelt speech, saying, "Tonight, I am delighted to host this banquet for representatives of the Japanese community. This is something I have eagerly anticipated for three years. I am extremely pleased to be able to gather and talk with you on this occasion, the third anniversary of the return to the capital. Since the National Government joined the war, the cooperation between China and Japan has become even closer, and the feelings between the peoples of China and Japan have become even more amicable. I firmly believe that the pledge of China and Japan to live and die together will be realized. Under this solid pledge, we will overcome all current hardships and advance toward the path of ultimate victory." He also wished everyone good health and continued efforts. Councilor Maeda then delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of the Japanese community. Afterwards, a banquet was held with music played by the military band. The atmosphere during the banquet was extremely harmonious. The guests and hosts parted happily at 9 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Shanxi Province Continue to Launch Sweeping Operations, Remnants of Bandits Annihilated Northwest of Linyi, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in Shanxi Province launched a fierce attack on the remnants of the Chongqing army in southwestern Shanxi Province starting at dawn on March 28th. That evening, they surrounded 1,000 soldiers of the Chongqing army near Beidong, 15 kilometers northwest of Xinjiang, and inflicted heavy casualties. Sweeping operations are still ongoing. As of March 30th, 354 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were left behind, and 100 were captured. The Japanese troops also seized 13 light machine guns, 111 rifles, 5,675 rounds of ammunition, 6 automatic rifles, and 239 hand grenades.</p>
<p>Jinan, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Yizhou Garrison, in cooperation with the Japanese army, launched a joint operation to clear out the remaining communist bandits in the area northwest of Linyi County on the 1st. They surrounded and attacked the Communist Border Region Detachment and the Fourth Regiment, killing 80 communist bandits and capturing a large amount of military supplies. During the operation, Lieutenant Wang Sicong, the captain of the Garrison, unfortunately died valiantly in battle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Information Department Announces War Situation in the Yangtze River Region</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Information Department stationed in China announced the war situation for the week of April 2nd as follows: In the sweeping operations in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the surrounding areas of Wuhan, the enemy suffered 2,100 deaths and 500 were captured. The operations are still in progress. The Chongqing side recently believes that the Japanese army is drastically reduced in strength and attempts to take advantage of the situation to strengthen its offensives in various aspects. They are currently under severe pressure. However, the reality is the opposite. In each operation, the number of enemy soldiers surrendering or being captured has sharply increased, proving that the Chongqing side has lost its will to fight and its resistance is declining. Furthermore, last year's call to retake Burma failed due to a lack of air power and insufficient weapons and ammunition. The main force was lost after one failed attack. Therefore, they are making every effort to cooperate with the British and American forces, waiting for an opportunity to act. Looking at last year's Burma campaign, the results of their joint operations should be clear.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders the Formulation of Commemorative Medals and Award Tables</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The National Government issued an order on the 2nd to formulate various commemorative medals and award tables according to Article 9 of the Implementation Rules of the Tongguang Medal Award Regulations, as follows: Commemorative Medal for Peace and National Construction (Table), First Visit to Japan Commemorative Medal (Table), Second Visit to Japan Commemorative Medal (Table), Visit to [blank] Commemorative Medal (Table), Pacification Commemorative Medal (Table), First National Military Conference Commemorative Medal (Table), Second National Military Conference Commemorative Medal (i.e., War Participation Commemorative Medal) (Table), Naval Conference Commemorative Medal (Table), Agricultural Encouragement Award Medal (Table). In the future, if new commemorative medals or awards are made, their tables will be determined by order. When wearing the New National Uniform, medals and tables are worn in the same manner as military officers. During wartime, medals are worn in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementation Rules of the Tongguang Medal Award Regulations, except that medals are worn on National Day and other major ceremonies in accordance with special regulations. This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<h3>Chen Qun and Others Telegraph Report on the Takeover of the Amoy Concession</h3>

He also provided boat rides on the lake. At that time, it was drizzling lightly, and the lake was surrounded by purple mist, with green willows and red peach blossoms on the shore, making the scenery even more vibrant. The representatives lingered in the park and were extremely pleased. At around 6 PM, they returned to their vehicles and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Chief of General Staff of the Military Council, Liu Yufen, Passed Away Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Liaison Meeting of Japanese Three-Provincial Officials in Guangdong Dissolved, Authority Transferred to Consulate to Execute</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese officials from the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries stationed in Guangdong, in order to establish close liaison, jointly established a "Guangdong Three-Provincial Liaison Meeting."

For four years, it has made significant contributions to the revival of South China. Recently, in order to adapt to Japan's new policies towards China, it was decided to transfer the authority of the meeting to the Japanese Consulate General in Guangzhou to execute after April 1st. Therefore, the meeting held its final liaison meeting on March 31st and was dissolved.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes Britain and the United States, Advocates Adopting Unilateral Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing news, Chongqing's rhetoric towards Britain and the United States, from the Casablanca Conference to Churchill's recent speech and the statements of Eden and Hull, is considered to still adhere to the principle of prioritizing Europe. Therefore, in a fit of indignation, it has become unbearable. The Chongqing National Daily and the China Times unanimously published articles at the end of last month, denouncing Britain and the United States and pointing out that Britain and the United States are no longer reliable. In order to seek self-reliance, unilateral diplomacy should be adopted as soon as possible. As the National Daily stated, "Since the Casablanca Conference, we have paid close attention to the strategic posture and political dynamics adopted by Britain and the United States. However, Churchill's speech in the British Parliament on March 21st not only greatly disappointed us, but also made it clear to us the attitude they have adopted. Therefore, we should now re-examine our own attitude. The content of Churchill's speech is different from that of Eden and Hull, which shows that his remarks are not representative of the highest opinions of the anti-Axis countries. At the same time, it also exposes that Churchill is merely a useless person. In the future, we should not only continue to pay attention to the dynamics of Britain and the United States, but also adopt unilateral diplomacy in order to seek spiritual self-reliance and self-renewal." The China Times stated, "After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the attitude of Britain and the United States was extremely unclear, and Churchill's speech was also extremely ambiguous. This really disappointed us greatly. Although Eden's speech was still able to clarify matters for us, its specific details are still difficult to understand. We deeply suspect whether British diplomacy has guiding principles. Therefore, we hope that it can express its highest diplomatic policy as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Handwritten Order to the New Citizens' Movement Committee to Re-examine Old Music Scores and Lyrics</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee recently received a handwritten order from Chairman Wang, instructing them to re-examine all old music scores and lyrics. The original order is as follows: "Currently, the songs used in various schools and organizations often use new lyrics to old scores. This is a quick fix, but some old music score lyrics are extremely inappropriate, and even with new lyrics, the songs sound awkward and even have a negative impact. The New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee should promptly work with the Ministry of Education, the Propaganda Department, and the Military Council to re-examine all music scores and lyrics. Any old music score lyrics that violate national policy should be prohibited from use. Talented music educators should be encouraged to devote themselves to promoting the goals of the New Citizens' Movement, and make every effort to fully express the firm comradeship and passionate emotions of restoring China and defending East Asia in the music score lyrics, in order to cultivate the spirit and interests of the new citizens. This order is issued by Chairman Wang Zhaoming of the National Government." After receiving the order, the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee has sent letters to the Ministry of Education, the Propaganda Department, and the Military Council, scheduling the first meeting to be held at 4 PM on the 3rd of this month. In addition, the Propaganda Department issued a circular on the Return to Capital Commemoration Day, ordering that all communications, news magazines, printed materials, songs, dramas, and public speeches, whether in Chinese or foreign languages, must be submitted for inspection. The inspection procedures will be announced within days, and local propaganda agencies will be instructed to comply.</p>

<h3>German Troops South of Lake Ilmen Turn from Defense to Offense, Launching Fierce Battles; Timoshenko's Offensive Completely Repulsed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front reports, German troops launched a fierce attack on Soviet positions in the Smolensk area on the 1st, occupying a certain important village and completely surrounding and annihilating the Soviet 4th Sniper Regiment. In addition, German troops south of Lake Ilmen have turned from defense to offense, launching intense battles in several locations along the Volkhov Front from Lake Ilmen to Lake Ladoga. German troops are gradually advancing and have completely repulsed the so-called Timoshenko Offensive. In addition, German troops besieging the Leningrad area recently bombarded the city's nearby railway facilities, military industry zones, and the Trellergonic munitions factory with heavy artillery, causing significant damage. According to German frontline news, German bomber squadrons raided Soviet airfields in Murmansk, heavily bombing facilities in the field and destroying many Soviet aircraft parked on the ground.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front reports, Soviet troops have launched fierce attacks on the lower reaches of the Kuban River for several consecutive days, but have made no progress. The Soviet army recently launched a general offensive north of the port of Zheleznyak on the 31st under the command of General Mansrenikov with a large number of reinforcements. As of the 1st, tank units of both armies are still engaged in fierce battles in the Anastasievskaya area north of the port. The purpose of the Soviet operation is still to advance westward to occupy Damansk and break into the central part of the main German positions north and south of the Damansk Peninsula. However, the Soviet offensive was halted by heavy bombing by German dive bombers, and the battle situation is gradually becoming favorable to the Germans. According to German news agency frontline reports, as of noon on the 1st, the Soviet army had lost 41 tanks, 13 aircraft, and a large number of artillery and other military supplies. In addition, a large unit of Soviet snipers was surrounded by German troops in a swampy area west of Anastasievskaya and is also on the verge of complete annihilation.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Southern Tunisia Continue to Shorten Their Lines</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the North African front, the Axis forces in southern Tunisia are continuing to shorten their lines. It is reported that the British and American forces are eager to attack and have suffered significant losses. The British Eighth Army Commander Montgomery is desperately attacking with a total of five divisions of tanks and infantry. However, the Axis forces are skillfully utilizing the terrain to retreat from the El Hamma-Gabès area and have moved their main force to the north. During the Axis retreat, Rommel's rearguard forces are hindering the Allied advance. The Axis air force is also assisting ground troops by heavily bombing the British forces. Furthermore, American and French rebel forces in the central region of Maknassy-El Guettar are attempting to join forces with the British and attack Gabès. However, due to the strong defense of the Rommel forces, the enemy is being held back and suffering significant casualties. According to German sources, in recent days, Rommel's forces in the southern and central regions have captured 2,000 enemy soldiers and destroyed over 100 enemy tanks, capturing 50 artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the situation on the Tunisian front: (1) According to the German daily communiqué, the Axis and Allied forces are continuing their fierce struggle, centered on the southern region. Although the German and Italian allied forces are firmly defending the Mareth Line, the British forces are outflanking them from the south. Due to the narrow isthmus between the coast and the hills, rapid withdrawal would be difficult if the situation worsened. Moreover, American forces are threatening their rear from the Gafsa area. Therefore, according to the planned strategy, they are withdrawing from the Mareth Line. The Axis forces have now constructed a defensive line in the Gabès-El Hamma northern region. It is expected that they will adopt flexible tactics in the future, exploiting the weaknesses of the Allied forces to inflict losses on them. This withdrawal is a skillful maneuver to completely maintain the initiative in the operation. This point can be proven by the fact that the British have reported very few German and Italian prisoners of war. According to German sources, the British have lost 215 tanks and many armored vehicles since the start of their offensive. At the same time, American forces and French rebel troops under Giraud are attacking Gabès from Maknassy and El Guettar, but have made no progress due to the fierce counterattacks by the Axis forces. The German forces have suitable defensive positions on the high ground north of Gabès and El Hamma. Therefore, the Allied attempt to encircle the Rommel forces has completely failed. At this point, the Tunisian campaign has entered its second phase.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Announces New Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, arrived in Tokyo by plane on the afternoon of the 1st to report on the situation in China after its participation in the war and the implementation of Japan's new policy toward China, and to discuss everything with the central government. He immediately went to the Greater East Asia Ministry and met with Minister Aoki. After the meeting, he met with a group of reporters and said that Japan's new policy toward China is currently only in the introductory stage and will soon enter the right track. In the early stage of the new policy's introduction, Chairman Wang visited Japan, and at the end of the introductory stage, Prime Minister Tojo visited China. Due to Chairman Wang's visit, there was full understanding between the two countries. The Chinese side, both central and local, feels a great sense of responsibility and is now moving forward hand in hand. The general economic community has benefited significantly. We are eager to smoothly promote these new policies, and the Chinese side has high expectations. Regarding the economic problems in North China, China and Japan are actively cooperating to improve the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Within the Allied Camp and Prospects for Germany's Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Lisbon, dated 24th) - On the European Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive has been blunted by the German counter-offensive. Both armies are now reorganizing their lines to prepare for the final battle. On the Tunisian front, the British Eighth Army has begun its offensive, and its outcome is gradually becoming clear. Meanwhile, on the political front, British Foreign Secretary Eden is flying to America to coordinate the disjointed Allied camp. The progress of the world war in the next two or three months is likely to have the most significant impact since the beginning of the war. The Lisbon branch of the Asahi Shimbun and the Buenos Aires branch recently took advantage of the opening of international telephone lines between the two cities to exchange views across the Atlantic on the 24th, seeking to uncover the truth behind this momentous opportunity, as follows:</p>
<p>Mogi, Lisbon Bureau Chief - Hitler and Churchill both gave speeches on the 21st, which raised interesting questions in many ways.</p>
<p>Imai, Buenos Aires Bureau Chief - Churchill's speech, and the purpose of Eden's visit to the United States, revealed the hopes of the British people for the direction and form of the post-war world. To soothe Soviet unease and disappointment, Churchill emphasized that Britain, America, and the Soviet Union would be the rulers of the post-war world, explained the Soviet Union's important role in building the new world, and announced a post-war four-year plan that would satisfy the Soviet Union. In short, this was just a gesture to appease the Soviet Union, and Churchill's political views were nothing more than the outdated idea of collective security, a mere replay of the failed efforts of the Allies after World War I. Such hollow pronouncements are clearly insufficient to appease the Soviet Union's deep dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Mogi - Yes, from the Soviet perspective, no matter how nice the post-war agreements sound, they are not as concrete as the issue of a British and American landing in Europe. Collective security and the League of Nations, which deal with post-war issues, will eventually turn against the Soviet Union and become an anti-Soviet alliance, so the Soviet Union prefers to break free from the realistic constraints of Britain and America.</p>
<p>Imai - For example, the Soviet Union's desire to possess the old borders of Poland, the three Baltic states, and Haan Kai Island in the Gulf of Finland is primarily aimed at securing strategically important locations that will play a significant role in future wars. Therefore, Soviet diplomacy is far more focused on reality than that of Britain and America.</p>
<p>Mogi - In theory, some in Britain seem to officially recognize this sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. But in practice, it becomes a problem. For example, the recent failure of Soviet-Polish border negotiations, not to mention America, even Britain views it as a Soviet delusion and will never allow the Soviet Union to have its way.</p>
<p>Imai - The Soviet Union is now single-handedly shouldering the heavy burden of the anti-Axis forces, and cannot shake off the feeling that it is fighting for Britain and America. But in order for the Soviet Union to continue the current war, Britain and America must yield to the Soviet Union's realistic demands for new territories.</p>
<p>Mogi - Since US Vice President Wallace's speech on cooperation with the Soviet Union, the British and American ruling class's expectations of the Soviet Union, and Britain's continued mediation between the US and the Soviet Union, maintaining its original position, were already known before Eden's visit to the United States. And regarding the imperialistic ambitions of the United States, Britain also views them as being of the same ilk as the Soviet Union's expansion of power, so it is doing its utmost to restrain them. During Eden's stay in Washington, according to an editorial in the Times on March 8, the conflict between Britain and the United States is due to the fact that the relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is based on mutual suspicion. The editorial discussed the security of post-war Europe, stating that only the Soviet Union has the strength to guarantee Europe, so its priority position should be recognized. Britain, due to its original position in Europe and its traditional policies, is naturally also a major player. The United States has no direct connection to the problems of Europe, so everything should be decided by Britain, which is located between the two continents. This self-centered assertion naturally irritates the United States. Churchill's speech was intended to revise this view.</p>
<p>Mogi - Some suspect that this editorial may have been written by Eden, but this seems to be a superfluous question. Eden himself has stated that this editorial does not represent any official British views. The anti-Soviet and anti-British sentiment in the United States is being heavily hyped by the British newspapers. According to recent weeks, this trend seems to have a considerable basis. The Washington correspondent of the Daily Mail said:</p>
<p>"Recently, another group in the United States, which does not support isolationism, is gaining power. They are demanding the occupation of military bases and the construction of a large national defense force. The atmosphere among the American people is far more tense than in Britain. In short, the United States is now pursuing its blatant imperialism."</p>
<p>The British economy is now heading towards national socialism at a very rapid pace. The production concentrationism mentioned in the proposal of Minister of Munitions Production Lyttelton at the beginning of this year is actually munitions production firstism, so the government's control over enterprises is extremely strengthened.</p>
<p>According to the above policy, Britain is now focusing on three production sectors: aircraft and their parts, ships, and anti-submarine defense equipment. Ninety percent of the new labor force and surplus labor force is concentrated in the above three sectors.</p>
<p>Imai - Within the Allied camp, Chongqing's position is the most pitiful. In Churchill's speech, Chongqing was kicked aside. He said: In the current situation, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are in a leading position, and in the coming year, or the year after, aid to Chongqing will only be provided after victory is achieved in Europe. Chongqing is the stepchild of the British and American camp. Compared to the important role played by Chairman Wang and Japan in the common front, Chongqing's position in the Allied camp seems particularly weak.</p>
<p>Mogi - British and American views on this point are slightly different. Britain does not view Chongqing as being equal to zero, but the United States is only superficially dealing with Chongqing because it is directly confronting Japan in the Pacific. On the British side, they are very unhappy due to the recent disastrous defeat on the Burmese front, so they do not have much hope for the Chongqing army. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable Discussion (1) Convened by the Continental News and this Newspaper</h3>
<p>Attendees:</p>
<p>Japanese Side:</p>
<p>Setsu Aoki, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>Fumikazu Takeuchi, Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>Toraji Kurimoto, Managing Director of Yinghua Trading Company</p>

<p>Chinese Side:</p>
<p>Quanshi Li, Special Economic Writer for this Newspaper, Director of the Chinese Economic Research Institute</p>
<p>Qingsan Yao, Director of the Research Office of Jincheng Bank</p>
<p>Yangyao Pan, Special Economic Writer for this Newspaper, Director of the Design Department of China Industrial Bank</p>
<p>Changqing Xu, Special Writer for this Newspaper, Director of the Personnel Management Office of Bank of Communications</p>
<p>Binhe Chen, this Newspaper</p>
<p>Mr. Binhe Chen: It is truly a great pleasure for Shen Bao to jointly hold this roundtable discussion with the Continental News today. We are especially honored to have the leaders of the economic circles from Japan and the authorities from our country's economic circles participating, and we should express our deep gratitude.</p>
<p>Mr. Osaka: I apologize for taking up everyone's precious time this evening, and my colleagues and I feel very honored. There are various forms of roundtable discussions, and I know that all of you present here are very experienced. However, I would like to emphasize that this roundtable discussion jointly held by newspapers is probably the first of its kind. At the same time, this is also the first time that both Japan and China have jointly held such a meeting. The results of the roundtable discussion will be published by the Continental News in Japanese newspapers, and by Shen Bao and New Shen Bao simultaneously in Chinese newspapers. A few days ago, an agreement was reached at the News Federation meeting on Sino-Japanese cooperation and advancement. This roundtable discussion is the first thing that was decided to be implemented in that agreement. Thanks to Mr. Chen's enthusiastic expectations, it has finally become a reality today. It is a great honor for the long-established Shen Bao and the young Continental News to jointly start doing this. Also, I would like to ask Mr. Takeuchi to preside over today's roundtable discussion. Now, let's ask Mr. Takeuchi to speak as chairman!</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi: It is presumptuous of me to act as chairman, but I don't know how to proceed. I really feel a bit flustered. Today's newspaper published the issue of purchasing the distribution mechanism, which I think is a good opportunity. I believe that the issue of purchasing the distribution mechanism itself is the first economic manifestation of the fact of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic policy shift announced on January 9, which everyone felt very happy about. At the same time, it is the most important starting point for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future. Regarding this relationship, I would like to ask Mr. Li to express his brilliant insights first.</p>
<p>Discussion Topics:</p>
<p>(1) After the transformation of Japan's new policy towards China, the new direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation with Shanghai as the center.</p>
<p>(2) Countermeasures for the current price problem.</p>
<p>(3) The revival of Shanghai's industry and the issue of increasing production.</p>
<p>(4) The issue of Shanghai Chinese stock trading and the stock exchange.</p>
<p>(5) Opinions on the establishment of a National Commercial Control Association and the easing of restrictions on the movement of goods.</p>
<p>Mr. Quanshi Li: (1) First, we must demonstrate true equality and cooperation in fact to seek the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity. On the one hand, ease restrictions on the movement of goods between Shanghai and other ports, and on the other hand, establish a National Commercial Control Association to assist the government in implementing national policies. For these two points to proceed smoothly, we must rely on the sincere cooperation of friends from the friendly country and not yearn for the monopolistic interests of the past few years.</p>
<p>(2) There are two main countermeasures for the current price problem: one is to increase the supply or production of goods, and the other is to stabilize the people's anxiety and panic about currency. To eliminate the people's anxiety about Central Reserve Bank notes, we must make the people believe that the Axis powers will surely win the final victory and that the new order in East Asia and the world will surely be established, and prove it with ironclad facts, so that speculators and hoarders who spread rumors and confuse the public will have no place to use their skills. If we can severely and fairly search for hoarded goods and distribute them comprehensively to consumers, we will be able to obtain the satisfactory results of a low-price policy.</p>
<p>(3) To revive Shanghai's industry and increase production, we must first unblock the source of raw materials. The starting point for Shanghai's industrial revival is the textile industry, so we must first unblock the source of cotton. To unblock the source of cotton, we must first sell Shanghai's daily industrial products, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, and sugar, to cotton farmers at low prices. Recently, the Central China Cotton Control Association, in order to save the lives of inland cotton farmers who are deeply threatened by speculative merchants, plans to distribute a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth and "Five Oceans" products to cotton farmers at official prices to stabilize their lives and increase the quantity of cotton purchased, which can be said to be truly in line with my wishes. If it can proceed smoothly, it will not be difficult for Shanghai's textile industry to revive quickly, and other industries will also be revived and increase production. Furthermore, exchange cheap industrial products for cheap agricultural products in rural areas. In this way, internal and external support, urban and rural assistance, the people's livelihood will be stable, and the rear will be consolidated.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai Chinese stock trading and the stock exchange may be allowed to resume operations, but on the condition that they do not engage in speculation and gambling to stimulate other price increases.</p>
<p>(5) Since the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association were published in the newspapers, many Chinese and Japanese merchants have been quite apprehensive, thinking that their activities will be restricted to the smallest possible extent, or even to none. This is actually an unnecessary worry. Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations clearly stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Association shall, in principle, not directly engage in the buying and selling of goods... Commercial organizations that have not joined the National Commercial Control Association shall not obtain the distribution of controlled goods." From this, we can know that although the activities of merchants will be greatly restricted in the future, they have not been completely stopped. However, under the new method, their profits will certainly not be as generous as in the past. Everyone should suffer wartime hardships, and it must be equal. We must never allow a few speculative hoarders to take the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits and make war money. Therefore, in all fairness, Chinese and Japanese merchants have nothing to complain about regarding this new method.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi: This issue also stems from the great transformation of Japan's policy towards China. Because of this, the expectations for the future operation of the Commercial Control Association are very high. Regarding this policy change, the new direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation centered on Shanghai, and the issues mentioned by Mr. Li, I would now like to ask Mr. Aoki from the Japanese side to express his views.</p>
<p>Mr. Aoki: From my observation, the war between China and Japan, which has lasted for seven years, is not about to end, is it? It is Japan that is entrusting everything to the Chinese economy and the Chinese government for the sake of China. The return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, etc., which were eagerly awaited before the incident, are all provided to the National Government. Japan's spirit of righteousness is expressed so clearly and explicitly. Moreover, Japan is doing its utmost to implement these matters. Japan's intention is to make China improve its domestic system. The so-called improvement of China's national system is Japan's consistent policy. Japan's enthusiasm for China's independence is sometimes even misunderstood by the Chinese side. Isn't that the reason for the outbreak of the China Incident? Now, Japan has declared war on Britain and the United States for the sake of liberating the Asian nations. China also follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Asian nationalism and declares war. Looking at this environment, I cannot help but forget what disputes there are between China and Japan. Japan's policy in the future will undoubtedly be to assist China in improving its domestic system. As the issue of the purchase and distribution of goods and the abolition of movement restrictions announced today is also an example of its implementation. To put it plainly, the improvement of China's domestic system is to make China's economic people and politicians complete it as their own responsibility, and Japan will wholeheartedly assist them. From this point of view, China's economic people and politicians must at least first devote themselves to devising ways to make the economic machinery in the current peaceful areas run smoothly and make the people live comfortably; secondly, to make the areas under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing government also be affected by it, so that the improvement of the whole of China will gradually be established.</p>
<p>Until now, no matter what, because Japan has war behavior in China, or Japan, although unwilling, has had points that cannot fully meet the wishes of all parties in China due to the inevitability of combat. This is due to the unavoidable reason of Japan's war behavior. This is something that I would like to ask everyone in China to understand. Because of the National Government's participation in the war, for the sake of the Asian nations, the two major independent countries of the East have declared war on the world. We are completely embracing the same belief and rushing forward on the road of co-existence and co-prosperity for the Asian nations. That is, Japan is within the scope of its duties, and China is within the scope of its duties. The two countries mutually enter the era of improving the war participation system.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Japan's policy towards China is nothing more than hoping that China will develop as a respectable independent country in the East. Therefore, what Japan is doing this time is just putting the policies it has previously held into practice. In the future, the Chinese side should unhesitatingly accept Japan's moral heart and proceed with the improvement of all national systems that can be expected to lead to the advancement of an independent country in the East. The first point is to attempt to adjust the economic dynamics. That is, to take stabilizing the lives of the Chinese people in the normal static economic state as the first priority. In order to implement this policy, all aspects of the Chinese financial world must unite and strive towards this great goal. To this end, we Japanese economic people are also very willing to cooperate with you and work hard to establish Japan's trade relations with China. If everything that Japan has now liberated to China is only used by a local economic person's interest behavior, and not used for the huge purpose of urgently improving China's domestic system, then China is simply destroying itself! On this point, Chinese economic people, the press, and politicians must never forget the existence of China, never forget that China and Japan are in the same boat to deal with their Europeans and Americans. It is enough to clearly recognize only this fundamental problem; other trivial matters, China's actions towards the Japanese, or the Japanese's actions towards the Chinese, even if there are mutual grievances and dissatisfaction, are of no great importance.</p>
<p>However, these sound Chinese economic people and sound Japanese economic people, if they truly recognize these situations, will definitely be able to completely correct them. These various conflicting aspects must be eliminated through mutual understanding, and the establishment of a war system is the only task. We Japanese economic people wholeheartedly wish for the complete success of the measures taken by the Japanese government this time. And the Chinese people, for the good political implementation and the good economic progress they have gained as a result, will undoubtedly praise them in the same words, which can be expected. And we Japanese economic people are prepared to wholeheartedly assist them. With such intentions, even if various problems arise in the future, Chinese and Japanese economic people will surely be able to trust each other without suspicion and resolve them on the basis of genuine righteousness.</p>

<h3>Adapting to Citizens' Needs: Edible Oil Universally Sold Throughout the City Starting Today; Four Ounces per Person Calculated Based on Household Population; Purchase Once with Housing Donation Ticket and Distribute Independently; Landlords Must Not Shortchange</h3>
<p>The supply of edible oil in this city will be sold based on housing donation tickets starting today, with a stipulated amount of four ounces per person. This is essentially a trial run of rationing oil based on population. However, the purchase method is not based on the edible oil coupons issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, but is separately stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>Sales Method</p>
<p>Calculate: (1) In the International Settlement (including Hongkou), purchase with winter housing donation tickets and the citizen ID cards of household members. (2) In the French Concession, purchase with November/December housing donation tickets and the residence permits of household members. (Another report: To facilitate residents, the edible oil wholesale depot has specially stipulated that residents may now use the January/February housing donation tickets and the head of household’s ID card.) (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong, purchase with household registration certificates, house number certificates, and the residence permits of household members. (Those who have not obtained a residence permit may purchase with the application receipt.) Four ounces are sold per person, based on the number of people noted on the back of the housing donation ticket. However, the head of household must combine the total household population to purchase the entire amount at once and distribute it independently. Landlords are absolutely forbidden from shortchanging. Violators will be severely punished. The price is set at 2.55 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per four ounces.</p>
<p>367 Retail Oil Shops</p>
<p>Only soybean oil is sold in this period, totaling over 10,000 dan. The distribution of edible oil will be based on the population of each district's Baojia system. Designated retail oil shops are supplying the edible oil, with a total of 367 shops in the city: 104 in the International Settlement, 66 in the French Concession, 46 in Huxi, 48 in Nanshi, 23 in Pudong, 1 in Longhua, and 79 in Zhabei. Each retail oil shop has a number plate with its assigned number displayed at the entrance. The distribution is universal, and the hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. Citizens can purchase the full amount from the designated retail oil shop within their Baojia area during this period, so there is no need to rush or crowd. The list of designated retail shops with their addresses has been posted at each shop for citizens' reference. If there are any questions, citizens can inquire at the nearest oil shop.</p>
<p>Rationing to Be Evaluated Based on Results</p>
<p>Regarding the question of when the plan for rationing oil based on population will be implemented, according to a staff member of the allocation section of the wholesale depot speaking to a reporter, this current purchase of oil based on housing donation tickets and calculated by household population is already a trial run of rationing based on population. Formal implementation will depend on the results of this period. Furthermore, it is understood that special allocations of oil to various organizations in the city are currently temporarily suspended. However, police officers in the city and the two settlements will still receive their regular allocation, but in very small quantities.</p>
<h3>31st Installment of Household Rice on Sale Yesterday; Shortage of Household Rice in Huxi; Public Rice Distribution Office Explains Reasons</h3>
<p>Rice shops in the two settlements began selling the 31st installment of household rice yesterday, consisting of half a sheng of broken rice and two sheng of unpolished rice, sold for 7.5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, and 1.8 jin of number two flour, sold for 3.5 yuan. The sales period for this installment of rations ends on the 9th.</p>
<p>Household Rice in Huxi to Be Distributed Next Week</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Bureau has stipulated and announced the quantity and price of grain rationed per capita in the city in each installment, in order to prevent malfeasance. However, it is reported that designated public rice distribution centers in the central district of Huxi often violate the regulations and change the prices. It is heard that the Food Bureau will order the district governments and public rice distribution offices to comply. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the Huxi District Government and the Huxi District Public Rice Distribution Office yesterday to clarify the actual details. It was said that due to certain circumstances in the Huxi district, a shortage in quantity is often found when each installment of household rice is shipped and allocated. Therefore, the amount of household rice distributed in the previous few installments was slightly less by one or two he. However, it is claimed that the selling price is calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Food Bureau, so the selling price varies slightly each period, but this is all due to the rice quantity and there has been no covert raising of prices. It was also learned that 5,650 bags of the 8th installment of household rice for the 22nd two-fang in the Huxi district could have been shipped out this week, but due to procedural reasons, it may be distributed starting next week.</p>
<h3>Pickpocketing Activity Increases Again; Authorities Launch Second Round of Crackdown; Scheduled to Commence Citywide on April 12th; Hoping for Cooperation to Ensure Personal Safety</h3>
<p>The English "Times" reports that according to the Chief Inspector of the Police Department speaking to a reporter, the weather is gradually warming up and residents are wearing less clothing, so pickpockets have increased opportunities for activity. Therefore, the Police Department plans to launch a second round of pickpocketing crackdown starting on April 12th.</p>
<p>Previous Campaign Already Effective</p>
<p>It is said that the Police Department, in view of the increase in pickpocketing, launched a crackdown four months ago, and the results were almost as expected. In the past four months, pickpocketing cases in this city have greatly decreased, and the police have found it easier to solve crimes.</p>
<p>Most Thieves Already Released</p>
<p>Most of the thieves have been punished according to the law. These individuals were sentenced to three or four months of imprisonment, while some, who committed more serious offenses or were repeat offenders, were sentenced to six months. It is said that almost all of the pickpockets have now been released from prison, so public order has been newly challenged. The police have been receiving continuous reports of pickpocketing cases every day, so the police have decided to launch a second crackdown.</p>
<p>Police Officers Conduct Close Surveillance</p>
<p>Starting on April 12th, slogans and publicity materials will again be posted in trams, theaters, restaurants, and other public places, warning the public to be aware of the activities of petty thieves. At the same time, the police and Baojia personnel will conduct close surveillance of pickpocketing activities. Once discovered, they will be subject to severe penalties. The Chief Inspector of the Police Department concluded by saying that the scope of pickpocketing activities has expanded, but they are often quickly caught. The public must cooperate to ensure their own safety.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Levies Summer Municipal Tax; Collectors Carry Certificates; In Case of Questions, May Be Reviewed with Collectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau is now collecting the summer municipal tax. Collectors are being dispatched separately. It is understood that the collectors are carrying certificates issued by the authorities. If citizens have any questions, they may review them with the collectors.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Baojia District Solicits Second Round of Baojia Funds</h3>
<p>The Xinzha District Baojia Committee solicited Baojia funds from the residents of the district once last April, when the Baojia system was first established. However, this was temporary in nature, and the funds would be returned once a base fund was raised. For a year, because the base fund has not been secured, the committee has resolved to solicit a second round of funds from the citizens. The donation books have been distributed by the District Committee to the Lianbao, which will forward them to each Bao for door-to-door solicitation. It is also announced to the Baojia heads that this solicitation of Baojia funds is still voluntary and no coercive action should be taken.</p>
<h3>Smoking Strictly Prohibited for Tram Passengers</h3>
<p>For safety reasons, the Shanghai Municipal Council Tram Company authorities strictly prohibit passengers from smoking. If a passenger is found smoking, the ticket seller may stop them. At the same time, the words "No Smoking" have been painted in red inside the carriages to alert passengers.</p>
<h3>Infant Health Competition Finals Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Infant Health Competition Committee, in celebration of Children's Day, held infant physical examinations from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily from March 28th to April 1st for five days, and scheduled the finals to be held at the Nanshi Experimental Public Education Center on Children's Day, April 4th, with awards given on the spot. The time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and a grand occasion is expected.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper publication time was 7:35 AM.</p>
<h3>Short Commentary: Please Read the Overview of Relief Work by the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association</h3>
<p>"Poverty" and "sickness" are both painful aspects of life, but being both poor and sick is the most unbearable of all suffering. Those of us who are fortunate enough not to suffer from the torment of poverty and sickness should, with a sense of human mutual aid, put ourselves in the shoes of our poor and sick compatriots and try to find ways to fulfill our duty to alleviate their suffering. The simplest way is to contribute money and entrust a fair organization to centrally handle the relief work.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, as can be inferred from its name, was motivated by the aforementioned duty by the founding gentlemen. After its establishment in the early summer of last year, the association presided over and handled emergency relief for epidemics, provided medical care, medicine, clothing, and porridge, and adopted the policy of not directly organizing but doing its best to subsidize established charitable organizations. The responsible personnel within the association are all enthusiastic and fair, fulfilling their duties to the best of their ability, and are very strict and serious in auditing and inspecting, not wasting a penny, taking one point from society and using it for one point in society. This kind of work ethic is indeed worthy of praise and admiration.</p>
<p>However, a close reading of the total amount of donations, compared with the population of Shanghai, would have to be called a failure, which directly affects the weakness of the relief effort. Let's take another look at a certain large restaurant that recently opened on Nanjing Road, which has a monthly turnover of 1.2 million yuan. Truly, a single banquet costs thousands of gold. If we compare these two things, we can see the true face of luxury and parsimony in society. "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are corpses frozen to death" is confirmed here.</p>
<p>The summer season is fast approaching, and we earnestly hope that the association will not plan for a passive end, but will continue to strive actively. With the compassionate desire to save the poor and sick, it is believed that the responsible gentlemen of the association, with their broad minds, will never allow this work to be interrupted.</p>
<p>Today, this newspaper has specially published this long article, "Overview of Relief Work by the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association," in the space of the fourth and fifth editions, while temporarily suspending the Free Talk section, which shows our slight support for this social undertaking. Please readers, understand. Although this article is biased towards reporting on names and figures, from here we can measure the extent to which people from all walks of life support social undertakings, so we hope that readers will read it carefully.</p>
<h3>Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau recently received a confidential report that unscrupulous people are extorting water and land transportation and preserved meat taxes in the name of the Bureau. After investigation, the Bureau has no such tax regulations. This is clearly a case of treacherous villains cleverly establishing a name, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, in addition to issuing a general order prohibiting such activities, it also orders the relevant industries to pay attention. If unscrupulous people dare to collect taxes under false pretenses, they should report to the Bureau, which will impose severe penalties.</p>
<h3>Commentary: On Prices</h3>
<p>Starting on March 12th, the authorities of our friendly nation, Japan, in order to respect China's sovereignty, specially returned the right to control material resources to our country, so that it could achieve independence and autonomy. In order to control material resources, centralize allocation, and adjust prices, our country's authorities established the National General Association for Commercial Control. It goes without saying that the association will become the highest organ of economic control in an epoch-making way. However, there is one thing that must be said regarding the issue of thoroughly adjusting prices.</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of daily necessities have seemed to turn downward in part due to the strict control and allocation adopted by the authorities, with the black market for white rice being one example. But since grain is the center of the price problem, why are the prices of most daily necessities still higher than they were a month ago? The crux of this matter must be briefly discussed: In fact, the selling price of goods at the retail level must be based on the prices opened by the wholesalers, and the wholesalers are based on the so-called "factory prices" of the manufacturers. Therefore, the fundamental solution to thoroughly adjust prices lies in the unified planning of "prices"; the most reasonable calculation should be made for the costs of the manufacturers (including raw materials) and expenses, etc., and then the most reasonable price should be determined based on this calculation, so that wholesalers and retailers have no excuse or way to raise prices. At the same time, the gradual raising of prices by wholesalers and retailers should be quickly sanctioned, and the excessive purchase of goods by anyone should be strictly restricted. This is a stopgap measure. As for the fundamental solution, the fundamental is indeed more important than the stopgap, but the stopgap and the fundamental should be implemented in a complementary manner.</p>
<h3>Morning Business Organizations in the City to Be Under the Jurisdiction of the Food Bureau</h3>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: After the official reorganization and establishment of the Municipal Food Bureau, the internal structure and personnel allocation of the Bureau have been adjusted separately. According to reporters' inquiries, the first, second, and third sections of the Bureau are responsible for promoting the administrative work of the Bureau, with two sections set up under each section. The Secretariat has three sections: document, general affairs, and accounting. The Food Allocation Office has three sections in the first group: regulation, allocation certificate, and procurement. The second group has three sections: public rice distribution, warehousing, and transportation. The third group has three sections: sugar, oil, and miscellaneous grains. It is also heard that the Donggou Farm and Forestry Experimental Area in the urban area, the Donggou Agricultural Improvement Area, and the Zhenru Agricultural Improvement Area will also be placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau because they are related to agricultural production matters, so that they can engage in supervision and increase urban agricultural production.</p>
<h3>General Commercial Control Association to Close Yarn and Cloth Registration; Today Is the Last Day</h3>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: The National General Commercial Control Association entrusted the Joint Association of Cotton Mills, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association to handle the registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory. The original deadline was March 31st, and the registration was also handled by the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Later, the Chinese Chambers of Commerce jointly submitted a letter stating that the number of people requesting registration was too large at one time and they were unable to complete the registration within the time limit, requesting an extension of three days. Therefore, in order to take care of the interests of the holders, the inventory registration date has been extended to today (3rd) at 4:00 PM. No further extensions will be granted beyond this limit. Therefore, there is still one day for registration today. It is hoped that all yarn and cloth holders will hurry to the designated agencies to complete the registration procedures and not wait and see and delay themselves.</p>
<h3>Local Financial Authority Explains the Exchange Rate Between Central Reserve Bank Notes and Allied Bank Notes</h3>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: According to reporters' inquiries with local financial authorities yesterday, there is no problem with the exchange ratio between Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes in substance. The high-flying situation in the market today (i.e., the 2nd) is not without merchants and civilians misunderstanding the various reasons, and being disturbed by the instigation of the general market manipulators. The relationship between military scrip and Allied Bank Notes is a special kind of linkage, so military scrip and Allied Bank Notes are circulated at the same value in North China. Now that the new issuance of military scrip has been stopped in Central and South China, the exchange between currencies in North China and Central and South China should be based on Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes as the exchange unit. In substance, the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes has not changed in Central and South China, and there is no difference in value even in North China. The smooth circulation of materials is still the main factor in the various stages. Moreover, Allied Bank Notes have not yet been used as a medium for purchasing materials in Central and South China, so Central Reserve Bank Notes and Allied Bank Notes are only in a direct exchange relationship and there is no substantial conflict. If there is no inducement from speculators, there is no reason for volatility in the minds of legitimate businesses.</p>
<h3>All Banks and Money Exchanges Closed for Three Days Starting Today</h3>
<p>Today (3rd) is the Spring Festival holiday. As usual, all banks and money exchanges in the city will be closed for the Spring Festival for three days from the 3rd. The 6th will be a make-up day because the 4th is a regular Sunday holiday. It is heard that the Material Movement Permit Office of the National General Commercial Control Association will also be closed for one day today (3rd).</p>

<h3>This Month's Industry and Commerce in the City More Developed Than the Previous Two Months</h3>
<p>It is learned that the number of newly opened industries and businesses in the city this month (March) includes eighteen banks, ten money exchanges, two property enterprise companies, one department store, two preserved meat shops, and one restaurant, totaling forty-seven. In addition, there are two companies that have resumed operations.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce More Developed Last Month</p>
<p>One battery factory and one money exchange have closed down. In addition, a total of nine money exchange enterprises were founded and established in the past month. Compared with January and February, the situation of opening and establishing businesses this month is significantly more developed. According to statistics, two new banks were opened in January, seven money exchanges, and eight insurance companies and enterprise companies. Fifteen new banks were opened in February, ten money exchanges, and ten insurance and enterprise companies.</p>
<p>Development Has Reached Its Peak Only in the first half of this month were most of the new banks, money exchanges, and enterprises opened. Very few new banks and money exchanges were opened in the second half of the month. Therefore, the development of industry and commerce in the city reached its peak in the first ten days of this month.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Stops Issuing Coal Movement Permits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council used to issue movement permits for coal matters at the Coal License Issuance Office, Room 335, Shanghai Municipal Council Building. However, the office has already stopped issuing permits as of yesterday (2nd).</p>
<p>Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Establishes Economic Office</p>

<h3>Deliberations on the Implementation of Commercial Control (3)</h3>
<p>— Gao Maoxun</p>
<p>(4) Eliminate the Buying and Selling of Factory Slips The above-mentioned warehouse slips are enough to promote speculation, help hoarding, and undermine control. This is the situation after shipment. If before shipment, there are orders placed with manufacturers and the manufacturers issue factory slips, the issuance of such factory slips allows manufacturers to record less than the actual shipment, and at the same time, they can transfer and sell them for speculation, hoarding, and undermining control. This is similar to warehouse slips in terms of having different effects from the same source. Therefore, in order to control materials, in addition to implementing warehouse management, it is also necessary to eliminate the buying and selling of factory slips. The establishment of a unifying permanent inventory system is for the control of materials in terms of quantity. Warehouse management and the elimination of the buying and selling of factory slips are for the control of materials in terms of physical objects. The two are like shadows following their forms, and neither can be neglected. If they can be implemented simultaneously, then manipulation and hoarding will have no way to use their skills.</p>
<p>What has been said above may be difficult to implement in reality at present. There are two reasons for this: (1) Talents are not easy to recruit, and (2) human emotions are not easy to reject. Regarding the first point, there is a greater shortage of senior statistical accounting talents than before the incident, and we should immediately recruit them in various ways to specialize in planning and guiding the implementation. As for the low-level personnel engaged in mechanical work, we can recruit some students who have studied statistics and accounting and have some warehouse experience, give them short-term training, and they can be employed. Regarding the second point, paying attention to private interests and not being willing to enforce the law is a common problem of our country's citizens. Therefore, it is most worrying to manage control in a way that is autonomous by merchants. I humbly believe that if this kind of concept cannot be resolutely eliminated, it fundamentally violates the spirit of control. The object of control is material resources, those controlled are merchants and civilians, those who feel inconvenienced are merchants, and those who look forward to obtaining benefits are civilians. Benefiting the people is the way to benefit the country. This is the highest goal of implementing control. As the ancients said, "Why cry in one family when you can cry on the road?" Understanding this is enough to talk about control. Based on this, control must be based on academic theory and framed by laws and regulations. If it is mixed with the concept of personal interests, narrow sympathy, avoiding difficulties and seeking ease, in order to cater to the psychology of accumulated evils, and only focus on the issuance of permits, it seems to lose the original meaning of controlled economy. If this article by yours truly can arouse the consideration of the responsible authorities and the research of academic experts to conduct further deliberations, so that a strong and effective method of controlled economy can be established, it would not only be the good fortune of academics, but also the blessing of the people. (The End)</p>

<p>Now, the subsidy periods of the above-mentioned charitable organizations have successively expired, and prices are increasing daily, making it increasingly difficult for the general poor and sick compatriots to maintain themselves and making relief more urgent. They have successively sent letters requesting the Association to continue subsidizing them to overcome the difficulties. However, the Association has already distributed all the donations it has received and finds it extremely difficult to cope. It sincerely hopes that the leaders of various trade associations in the city and charitable people from all walks of life will promptly donate to support this good cause, so that this only fundraising group in the city and the surviving well-managed charitable organizations will not be interrupted.</p>
