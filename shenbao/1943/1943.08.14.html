<p>社評</p>
<h3>市政建設芻議</h3>
<p>自從法租界和公共租界接收以後，上海市民，除對於收回國家主權的欣幸，是心理一致外，對於市政前途的觀感，却不甚相同。第一種是絕對信賴當局的，以為接收租界，從此政令統1，事權集中，市政當局自當加倍努力，市政前途祗有格外光明燦爛。第二種却顧慮到一八兩區內的道路H程，淸潔衛生，治安秩序，也許不能維持舊觀，因此不免影響及於地產價格和商業繁榮。前者是以樂觀心理去推測未來；後者則以事變後滬西南市之畸形現狀引為炯戒。究竟市政前途怎樣？我們認為還要待市政當局拿事實來證明，現在就樂觀或悲觀，都未免失之過早。</p>
<p>過去「租界」的行政，以國人立塲言，再與各國重要都市市政作比較，誠多令人不能滿意之處。現已事過境遷，無　追述。我們應該研究者，是「相界」以往的行政，有無優點，可供吾人採擇。在這裏我們應該特別提出的，第一是人事制度，以往公共租界工部局錄川職員，都要經過甄別試用的程序，一經正式錄用之後，非有重大過失，不輕予辭退。因為有了甄別試用的辦法，所以濫竽者不易倖進；因為有了保障的辦法，纔能使工作者安心服務。中國行政機關的通病，就是用人太冗濫，職務無保障。因此養成人人視一官如傳舍之心理，縱不利用地位和機會去營求私利，也決談不到工作興趣與效率。市政是一種有繼續性的工作，從業人員任事愈久，情形愈熟，則工作效能亦愈高。聽說自從一八兩卜公署成立以後，外間狃於官塲之舊習，歆於待遇夕優厚，　轉請託，希冀於共中得一席者，頗不乏人，為當局計，即屬眞正人材，亦仍當以工作之需要為前提，不可隨意安插。倘其人為鑽營倖進之流，則更應立即嚴詞拒絕。蓋應酬敷衍之辦法，今日可以施之於甲，則明日乙亦必援例要求。，何况有一人不稱職，即足以影響全體之工作精神。所以以往的良好人事制度，必須繼續維持。其次，過去「租界」對於道路公共建築物下水道之修繕維持，皆不遺餘力，故市容整齊，衛生狀况良好。上海是中國的門戶，中外觀瞻所繋，市容是給予中外人士，尤其是初到上海的外邦人士的第一個印象，於國家地位，均有關係。因此市容方面，至少也應該維持和原來的一樣程度。可是，上海是吾國最大都市，以工商業和人口而論，在吾國各市中都居於領導地位，決不能以維持現狀就算滿足，還應該更進一步，繼續不斷的改革，便成為全國各市的楷模。不過，在戰時經濟與物質極端困難情况之下，過存奢望，結果亦等於空談。所以我們僅在事實可能範圍以內，貢獻下列各　改革意見，希望市政當局能予考量採納：</p>
<p>輔助工業　過去上海之所以能特別繁榮，因為上海除了是一個重要的吞吐港以外，還是中國工業的中心，要繼續維持上海之繁榮，必須從維持上海的工業入手。事變以後，上海的工廠，因為原料不足，動力限制，大部份已陷於半停頓狀態之中。關於原料的缺乏，固非上海市政當局所能單獨解決，但是為了上海市區的繁榮，市政當局即不能不以全力去推動。至如限制用電，如果為了設備和燃料問題，當然非一時所能解決，甚至於非戰後不能解決，可是現在限制用電的情形，却是限制其不當限制，而不限制其所當限制，照我們粗疎的計算，如果停止上海一切夜市，限制家庭用電，至少一部分因為動力不足而陷於半停頓狀態中之工廠，可以恢復全工。此舉不特有助於工業生產之增加，同時亦可得到實行節約之結果，减少無數大都市的罪惡。</p>
<p>增設各級學校樹人為國家百年之大計，人材之消長，關係國家之盛衰。過去「租界」當局對於華人敎育向不重視。其由市政經費支出而設立之華人學校，寥寥無幾。其敎育方針，亦僅為造成工部局及洋行職員。但事變以前公私立著名學校林立，市民子弟求學問題，尚不感覺嚴重。事變以後，市區各校以軍事關係，紛紛遷入租界，因為房屋的難覓，便不得不數校合賃一校舍。因為時間的不敷支配，便不得不改為半日制。至於房屋光綫與設備，是否適合學校用途，更屬無法　到。這種因陋就簡的辦法，不但影饗學生學業，並且影響國民健康。從另一方面說，因為學費的不斷增加，有許多家長就無力供給子弟求學。這是目前與將來的一個最嚴重的問題。我們渴望市政當局，能設法利用一八兩區內許多空閉的公私建築（例如八區內國立中法專門學校，及一區內英美駐軍的營房），從速普遍設立各級公立學校，以最優良的師資，禾最廉低的學費，來彌補眼前教育的缺陷。最近聽說市政當局要限制取締於戰時生活不甚需要的營業，果成事實，校舍問題，更易解決，學校數額，更可多多增加。萬一市政當局顧慮到敎育經費支出太多，不免要增加市民負担，也可以擴大補助私立學校範圍，增加補助金額，為臨時補救之一法。但是對於師資的選擇，敎育水準的提高，必須列為補助的重要條件之一，方不失作育人材之意義。</p>
<p>改善公共衛生設施　公共衛生設施，關係市長健康甚鉅，對於平民階級，尤感迫切需要。舉一二事實言，以偌大上海，至今尚無公共浴室的設置，而私人經營的澡堂，又都收費甚昂，平民階級尤共平民階級的婦孺，除（夏天以外，就根本沒有洗浴的機會。其次自從生活程度增高以後，疾病後之診金藥費，都成了每一個市民的嚴軍問題。以致由小病而變成產病，由重病而淪於不洽者，比比是。此種現象，都急待市政機關的從速改善。改善步驟，</p>

<p>那不勒斯被炸慘狀</p>
<p>那不勒斯十三日中央社電　海通社戰地記者稱：目前之那不勒斯，面目已與五星期前大異，視之幾不能復　矣。自經英，美之轟炸後，城中最美麗之區已破壞殆盡，據目擊者（言：美機多自高空投彈，致千百所之房屋多成斷垣殘壁，此具有一百萬居民之義國第三大城之八千名救火員，全體出動，德•義兵士復盡力協助，然救火工作亦僅能緩緩進行。當余登地底街車視察時，景象誠可怖已極，每一地底車站，均成為數千民衆之避難所，婦孺老弱隨處皆是，有以磚石就地為界，作為臨時公館者，此一地下避難收容者何止萬千無家可歸之人，吾人在其中行達數小時之外，幸那不勒斯盛產水菓，居民尚能一嚐甜味，一般人初以為那不勒斯之人民必將趨於沮喪，但余則　彼等之意志己愈益堅定。</p>

<h3>自第一版轉來</h3>
<p>第一要從速普遍設立公共診療所，免費治療，廉價供給藥品。至如醫師人選，則可規定在上海市內每一個開業醫師，都有劉出一部份時間担任公共診療所診務的義務。（工作仍給報酬）第二應普遍設立公共男女浴室，規定最低浴費，使一般市民，無論冬夏，皆有洗浴的機會。關於設置公共浴室有應注意者，就是盆浴或池浴，皆不免傳染疾病，有礙衛生，最好的辦法仍是用淋浴，至如浴巾肥皂，亦由入浴者自備，以免傳染病源，並可減輕開支。假定市政經費和房屋設備都許可的話，能逐漸增設平民醫院，平民產科醫院，則公共衛生之設施，愈見完備。</p>
<p>遣散無業游民無業游民是社會民生之蠢，不但有礙市容，並且影響治安。何况在都市糧食問題極端恐慌的今日，更不應該允許大量游民繼續存留在都市中間，以增加糧食機關的困難。我們建議凡無生活能力的游民。都應該設法遣送回籍。一方旣可整頓上海市容，一方亦可增加農村生產。耍是市政機關能仿照各國以往應付失業問題的方法，舉辦重大工程，例如疏濬蘇州河，修築海塘，不但可以訓練出一大批有用的工人，對於市政建設，　是莫大貢獻。</p>
<p>整飭風化都市是一個罪惡的淵藪，形成的原因，風化問題實佔重要成份，試以最近一兩年來犯罪的案情來分析，很少是與賭塲舞塲無關的。所以要减少犯罪案件，樹立良好秩序，根本辦法還應該先從整飭風　入手。過去「租界」對於賭塲取締極嚴，公開的賭塲早經絕跡，這種精神不但要繼續維持，還應該進一步暗中隨時調查，有無變相的秘密賭塲產生。至如妓寮舞塲，同樣為銷金之窟，前者尤有傳播花柳病菌之危險。在戰時是每一個國民都應生活自肅的時期，就使全部禁止，也不為過。假使市政當局為顧全一般妓女舞女的生計起見，不立刻就採用嚴厲的斷然處置，我們建議對於前者應該劃定區域，嚴加管理，並採取按年遞减的辦法。對於後者則可以减少舞塲供電，限制其營業時間，都不失為臨時補直之一法。</p>
<p>解決市民居住問題事變以後，居住問題，日趨嚴重，最初尚僅租賃整幢房屋須出頂費，最近則局部分租，亦非頂費不可。且即出鉅額頂費以後，房租仍不能小。據聞租屋困難之原因：（一）由於囤戶租作私人倉庫，不惜任何高價。（二）由於一部份投機者囤租大量房屋，出頂漁利。（三）由於分租利益優厚，故有多數人以租屋分租為專業。現在要想解決市民居住困難問題，第一應該限制供給人民居住之房屋，不得改充倉庫用途，其巳經用作倉庫者，亦宜限令尅期解租，將貨物移轉正式倉庫。此舉不但於消防行政隣舍安全有益，同時亦便於經濟行政機關之調查和管理。第二應從速恢復京滬兩市以往租賃登記辦法，凡租賃房屋者，必須購用市政機關製備之租摺，並嚴格規定：（甲）出租房屋祇限於業主或其委託代理人，（乙）訂化租約時必須呈騐產權證據及委託書。庶使囤屋出頂者，無所施其伎倆。第三分租漁利，一方侵害業主利益，一方壓迫三房客，其情最不可恕。因為分租的價格無限制，分租的利益太優厚，所以分租者得有從容待價，任意誅求的機會。要消弭這種現象，應該規定合理分租價格，不使分租者視房屋為奇貨可居，同時又不能不顧慮到空擱的損失。居住的困難問題，或可逐漸解決。以上所述，仍不免為臨時治標辦法；治本辦法，第一次歐戰後，歐洲各國居住問題極度恐慌之際，各地市政府除盡量提倡獎勵建築外，並對於市內房屋，作强制的統籌支配。這種辦法，是否也可適用於本市，亦不妨加以研究。</p>
<p>提倡都市田園化戰時以增加生產為第一耍義，因此凡屬可以利用之土地，無論面積之大小，均應充分利用，改作耕種用途，以謀民食之充裕。上海市內隙地尚多，半屬荒置，為謀都市本身之農產品增加，以調劑一部份民食計，宜由市政機關，詳細調查市內可以耕種之荒地面積，作成增產計劃，責或業主限期自行種植，或租人耕作。</p>
<p>以上所列諸點，皆屬市政經常工作範圍，行之匪艱，祇待努力。在此市政機關面目一新之際，我們相信市政當局一定可以採納芻議，來表示中國人接收「租界」後的第一步精神。</p>
<h3>卡科夫區戰事　將愈演愈烈　基洛夫北激戰時行中</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社一電　德元首行營戰報稱：東綫敵軍在飛機及坦克車協助之下，重新向庫班河橋頭堡克林斯克耶之西發動攻勢，亳無成就。貝爾格勒之西南，敵仍實續攻擊，在攻防戰用反攻時，敵軍不斷的攻勢盡被擊退。奧萊爾之西北，維雅慈瑪之南及西南，蘇軍反攻未獲逞。拉都加湖之南，敵已獲得增按，並已重新發動攻勢。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　　通社軍事特派員塞爾托里氏消息：三十八日以來之東錢夏季大戰之結果，一言以蔽之，即蘇軍並未獲得突破是也。但仍須繼續注意戰事之發展，以觀蘇軍是否終能達到其突破之目的。在過去二十四小時中，蘇軍在卡科夫之西北及東南增加其壓力。此可見蘇軍已盡力以求達到其計劃，德國亦增强抵抗，但依照德軍之彈性防禦戰略，堡壘陣地亦有放棄，因以全局為重心，而在此區域實無作過份犧牲之必要。但卡科夫區之戰事將愈演愈烈。而阻止敵軍之突破實為最重要之行動、德必須作更大之忍受，不論在奧萊爾之西面或蘇軍攻勢地區之南工，亦須準備感受更緊張之壓力也。基洛夫北面，戰爭猛烈進行，在基洛夫及耶爾塞伏之間，蘇軍暫時减弱，蘇軍之北　步兵較少、坦克車大砲及機械化部隊基多，但不見有何重要之成　。拉多牙湖之南，蘇軍在短時間，將不會採取大規模之攻勢。</p>

<h3>駐華日派遣軍　發表週間戰况</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　中國日派遣軍報道部十三日發表週問戰况，大意謂；日軍在各地猛攻渝軍，其情形日趨激烈，蓋日軍事先察知，于學忠所部第一區十一師第一百十四兩師企圖潛入魯西地區，為先發制人，即於七月廿七日、1齊開始猛攻，至三十日B收獲莫大戰果，計俘虜渝第一百十一師團長及上校等多人，擊斃渝軍達一千餘人，刻日軍正在微山湖附近肅淸殘敵中。又日軍對平西邊區，盤據蒙疆華北熱河書境一帶殘存共軍　擊隊，於十日開始行動，於十一日將共軍退路完全切斷，並緊縮包圍等，已紛碎其重建赤化工作。又美駐渝空軍於此次作戰中，受創慘電，似正力謀補救，並圖繼續反攻．但日軍嚴陣以待，故美機已無用武之地矣</p>
<h3>經過奈阿拉加　邱吉爾抵美　傳與羅斯福氏晤面後同返奎貝克開始會談</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十三日中央社電　據奎貝克來電：英首相邱吉爾與加拿大代表會談終了後，十二日晨，巳乘專車自卒員克出發赴美，邱吉爾一行，經奈阿加拉入美已經證實，惟其後美戰時新聞檢查機關禁止發表關於邱吉爾之動靜，據謂：邱吉爾或在美與羅斯福會見。又謂：邱吉爾此行乃為迎接羅斯福，二氏會見後，已同道返歸奎貝克開始會談，至其眞相則不明。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據奎貝克轉傳至此問之宣告稱：邱吉爾首相已離奎貝克　　方在美與羅斯福總統會晤，羅斯福•邱吉爾兩人會見之時間與地　•則未予宣布。據紐約消息稱：邱吉爾係乘專軍抵美，美方之　聞檢查員仔准　記者發表邱吉爾係從奈阿加拉瀑布方面入美之消息外其餘一律不許離載。</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹十堿日中央社電　此間軍界方而透露•斯達林已用外交方式向華盛頓致送報告一份，詳述東綫情勢，並渠本人對將來戰略之觀察，據云羅斯福，邱吉爾將以此報告向聯合參謀會議提出</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十三日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾</p>
<p>與加拿大當局會議終了後，即將與美總統羅斯福開始重要會議，關於會議之主要議題，約有二　第二戰綫及與蘇聯之關係，　促進對日軍反攻作戰、關於蘇聯政府所要求之第二戰綫，英•美則稱之為「要求第三戰綫」，蓋英•美以西西里島方面為第二戰綫，然蘇政府則要求自杜佛海峽登陸作載也。</p>
<h3>西西里東北部　橋頭堡强固　軸心軍採取重要步驟阻侵略行動伸至大陸</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員寒爾托里亞消息：西西里島戰事之現階段，乃德義聯軍作有秩序之轉動，使與敵軍避離，故敵方於其所佔之地區獲得穩定。現在最電要之步驟、乃為阻止侵略行動之伸展至大陸上面，此乃軸心軍在西西里島東北部所建橋頭堡之任務。該陣地較為堅固有力，此與東綫南部古班橋頭堡之情形相似，該處被德軍堅守已有半年，其範園愈小，則其抵抗力愈强，現軸心方面正希望在西西里島發生同樣之效果。軸心方面之移動，祇限於兩異，中路前錢仍屹立不動、反軸心軍於前星期之攻擊完全失敗。星期三英軍再度猛攻，仍無進展。但沿海公路前進之美第七軍，追踪德軍之退却者。現已抵達馬蘇地方，英第八軍右翼、沿東海岸之公路前進數里，愛特娜山地陣地之德軍，予敵軍以重大之損害。</p>

<h3>滿洲國的金融新體制　（二）</h3>
<p>普通銀行業務的整理</p>
<p>跟着上述抑制膨賬及土著資本動員的進展，金融機關亦積極進行整理，國內普通銀行的統合間題在以前是滿洲金融界的一件　案，自去年以來，進行頗為順利。牡丹扛•營口•佳水斯•哈爾濱等各地設立代表銀行，其整理原則大都市採複數制，中小都市採單數制，地方金融的面目為之一新。</p>
<p>其次，關於中央銀行整理普通銀行業務的問題，此在完成其使命，確立金融機關業務的分野上，是絕對必要的，趁中央銀行的改組的機會，而迅速地，體化起來。在本年四月中旬，中央銀行在全滿放款共約二千萬圓，而以對於鑛工業部門的金融業務移交於滿洲興業銀行。繼於五月旬上，自新京總行以次的各省公署所在地，及在其他都市的二十八所分行，以五百萬圓的普通放款讓渡於各該地普通銀行或商工金融合作社。又中立銀行設立要綱中規定，一俟與農合作金庫設立，中央銀行以省公署所在地及其他必要地以外的分行八十三所連其業務一併移讓於興農合作金庫，於此，確立了眞正的中央銀行的體制。</p>
<p>擔任重工業部門方面金融業務的滿洲興業銀行，接受中央銀行所移讓的鑛工金融部門後，為確保擴充生產的資金起見，在四月一日的股東總會中，決定把現在的資本金六千圓（內四千五百萬圓已付）增資為一億圓。至於普通銀行及商工金融合作社，據本年一月二十五日的商工金融合作社法，把原有三十五單位的商工金融合作社及中央會加以改組合併，以中央會為本社，以各單位合作社為分社，組成統一的新商H金融合作社，鈴二月一日開始業務。</p>
<p>如此、以重工業，一般工商業為對象的金融機關，已告整理完備。而農業金融方面，以興農合作社為中心的短期農業經營資金為主流，至長期的農業金融機構，則尚告缺如。故滿洲國如欲盡共食糧基地的使命，而欲造成農產物增度上所必要的農地，並農耕機械化，則以不動產為擔保的晨期金誰是必要的。</p>
<p>滿洲國政府亦正在迅謀對策，出資一億圓（完全由政府擔任）設立興農合作金庫，該金庫的設介要綱於七月八日通過於參議府，預定於八月一日創立。</p>
<p>該金庫承　中來銀行，擔任農業金融的業務向國內八十二所分行及興農合作社放款。對農家•糧棧等作抵押及信用放款。籌集資金的方法，擬發行以資本金十倍為限的興農債券。</p>
<p>這塲合成為問題者，如何調整與興農合作社業務的分別。興農合作金庫為農民的金融機關，對興農合作社貸出資金，而興農合作社的中央會則以以金融事業移交於金庫。</p>
<p>但興農合作社仍如前一樣行使農事金融業務，所需資金由該金庫供給、合作社所辦理的非社員存款業務亦已移讓。</p>
<p>自創設興農合作金庫後，原由滿洲興業銀行所新營　農產，畜產，林產，水產關係的業務，亦均移交於該金庫，移交金額約為興業銀行貸出總額的十五分之一。</p>
<p>金融新體制的確立</p>
<p>這樣，中央銀行成為發券銀行兼統制金融的實行機關，滿洲與業銀行為供給開發產業資金的鑛工金融機關•國內普通銀行及工商金融合作社為一般工商金融機關，新設的興農合作金庫，為農業金融機關，各向完成其使命之途邁巡。再加上了担任特產金融的正金銀行分行，於　確立了滿洲國國內各金融機關的業務分野。以中央銀行的改組為轉捩滿洲金融新體制於此遂告完幣。</p>
<p>滿洲國政府並中央銀行為欲貫徹政府的施策起見，與全部金融機　取得密切聯擊，以中央銀行為中心，而與興業銀行，普通銀行、及其他全滿金融機關打成一片，於本年二月一日組成滿洲金融協會，使滿洲的金融統制有史一步的進展。（完）（翔：　自「同盟世界週報」一二一八號）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>雨過天青以後</h3>
<p>因為不少　興的銀行錢莊一度入於風雨飄搖中，遂令人感覺收買紗布而引起金融界之波動。所幸連日銀行業同業方面鑒於通　上的責住•驚起維持，本市金融魄始皆穩定，著有雨過天靑之勞，這是　　慰幸的。可是•金融界一有波動•其中流砥柱•不是銀行業同業，而是國家領袖銀行，所以昨日本報社電　盼望政府於其貫　致令之中，兼顧金融實在情形‘而為適切的支援。即是此意。</p>
<p>話又要說囘來了，雨過天青以後，命融界即更當撫躬反省。　省些什麽？自間以前倉庫　面所堆積的大量抵押貨物·有沒有刺激物價上漲的性能？自問以前接收紗布綫單押款，是不是不具司馬昭之心？自問　款於人，利息而外，另定參加盈餘分配辦法，是不是合於銀行家之風度？諸如此類的問題，反省　來，祇怕徒增遺憾罷。</p>
<p>我們對於銀行自肅問題、言之屢矣。全融界果真自顧於先，則一切問題，根本即無由產生，即使產生．而與金融界並不發生什麼切　的關係，則雖遇有政治力量加以制裁時•亦不至有什麽波動。總之一句話，習於自由經濟傳統的上海金融界，必須努力適　今日　濟統制的環境，厲行自肅，然後可以立於不敗之地。</p>
<h3>銀行需正當頭雨　中儲繼續維持</h3>
<p>自收買棉紗棉布辦法公佈以從、所引起之本市金融界之不安狀態，昨日起已次第歸於平　，因傳即中央　備銀行為安定金融起見，對於各小銀行所需要於正當用途之頭寸　續維持供給，因此各行周轉絕無不靈之虞，而各種陰羅，自可全部廓淸</p>
<p>不安狀態漸次泯除</p>
<p>據金融界人＋語上　社記者政府所定　　棉紗布之措置，公佈之後確予金融　一大之震刺，尤以小銀行所受之打　誠屬不堪設想，因較近物資調查，　行殊為嚴格，並以收買紗布之法實施，物資簡直　於凍結狀態，是以棧單押放，不得不大爭繁縮，而小銀行利用投機性之頭寸，殊感困難，造成周轉不靈之象，而有倒閉之危　存在，外傳小銀行相繼　閉之說，即由此而起。今中　既可　　供給頭寸金融界所感之恐慌、殆可漸次泯除。</p>
<p>財辦情形可復正統</p>
<p>查本市銀行界　去不能自行整　。參予投機之現象，彰彰明甚，　以上銀行以投樣為　真，紛紛疫立、用小資本、做大生意，　倒乾坤，掀風作浪，以致投機　　之風，愈演愈熾，物價於焉飛漲，民有倒縣之苦，此實因為銀行界狃於自由　濟之傳統，一旦統制經濟之步驟加緊，頗　難以　應、而其原已不健全之茶礎·遂有崩　之可能。過去政府對於金融界希　　能　行自　、而今　用　　之步驟、使其自然淘汰或自行整飭機構、如此以從，財界之情形，可　歸於正統也。</p>
<h3>商統會遵令　收買紗布</h3>
<p>今月九日最高國防會犧　決通過收買棉紗棉布暫行條例及實施要綱，規定上海市內棉紗棉布收買事宜，由全國商業統制總會辦理，該會特於前日（十二日）下午召開理監事臨時聯席會議提出報告，經話決組設收買棉紗棉布辦事處，並訂定該處組織大綱，聘任棉製品同業聯合會理事長　路生為該辦事處處長，即日着手　組成立，以便遵令辦理收買事宜，並已將該辦事處組織大網及遵辦情形，呈報行政院備案。至收買棉紗棉布實施細則，現尚未奉行政院頒到，該會亦已呈院請迅將細則及要網第四款　給辦法第五款管理辦法等一併早日頃行，以資實施。又探悉收買棉紗棉沛辦事處組織，計分設五　辦事，關於收買棉紗棉布品質價格之審查評定，並另設查定委員。掌理　事云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>

<h3>Tentative Suggestions for Municipal Construction</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession and the Public Concession were taken over, the citizens of Shanghai, apart from the unanimous joy of recovering national sovereignty, have had differing views on the future of the municipality. The first view is absolute trust in the authorities, believing that with the recovery of the concessions, political orders will be unified, authority will be centralized, and the municipal authorities will certainly redouble their efforts, and the future of the municipality will only be even brighter and more splendid. The second view is concerned that the roads, cleanliness, sanitation, and public order within the first and eighth districts may not be able to maintain their former state, which may affect property prices and commercial prosperity. The former takes an optimistic view to predict the future; the latter takes the abnormal situation of the southwest Shanghai after the incident as a warning. What will the future of the municipality be? We believe that we still have to wait for the municipal authorities to prove it with facts, and it is too early to be optimistic or pessimistic now.</p>
<p>In the past, from the perspective of the Chinese people and comparing it with the municipal administration of major cities in various countries, the administration of the "Concessions" was truly unsatisfactory. Now that things have changed, there is no need to dwell on the past. What we should study is whether the previous administration of the "Concessions" had any advantages that we can adopt. What we should specifically point out here is, first, the personnel system. In the past, when the Public Concession Municipal Council hired employees, they had to go through a screening and trial period. Once formally hired, they would not be easily dismissed unless there was a major fault. Because there was a screening and trial method, mediocre people could not easily get in; because there was a guarantee method, workers could feel at ease to serve. The common problem of Chinese administrative organs is that they employ too many people and there is no job security. Therefore, everyone develops the mentality of treating an official position as a temporary residence. Even if they do not take advantage of their position and opportunity to seek private gain, it is impossible to talk about work interest and efficiency. Municipal administration is a continuous job. The longer the employees work and the more familiar they are with the situation, the higher the work efficiency. It is said that since the establishment of the Public Concession Municipal Council in the first and eighth districts, outsiders have indulged in the old habits of the officialdom, coveted the generous treatment, and sought connections, hoping to get a seat among them. For the sake of the authorities, even if they are truly talented, they should still take the needs of the work as the premise and not arbitrarily arrange them. If they are people who are scheming and opportunistic, they should be immediately and sternly rejected. Because the method of perfunctory dealing can be applied to A today, then B will inevitably demand the same tomorrow. Moreover, one incompetent person is enough to affect the work spirit of the whole. Therefore, the good personnel system of the past must be continued. Secondly, in the past, the "Concessions" spared no effort in repairing and maintaining roads, public buildings, and sewers, so the city appearance was tidy and the sanitation was good. Shanghai is China's gateway, and it is related to the observation of both Chinese and foreigners. The city appearance is the first impression given to Chinese and foreigners, especially those who come to Shanghai for the first time, and it is related to the national status. Therefore, at least the city appearance should be maintained to the same extent as before. However, Shanghai is the largest city in our country. In terms of industry, commerce, and population, it is in a leading position among the cities in our country. It is definitely not enough to maintain the status quo. It should be further reformed continuously to become a model for all cities in the country. However, in the extremely difficult situation of wartime economy and materials, excessive expectations are tantamount to empty talk. Therefore, we only contribute the following opinions on reform within the scope of factual possibility, hoping that the municipal authorities can consider and adopt them:</p>
<p>Assisting Industry The reason why Shanghai was able to be particularly prosperous in the past is because Shanghai was not only an important transit port, but also the center of Chinese industry. To continue to maintain Shanghai's prosperity, we must start by maintaining Shanghai's industry. After the incident, most of Shanghai's factories have been in a state of semi-paralysis due to insufficient raw materials and power restrictions. The lack of raw materials is of course not something that the Shanghai municipal authorities can solve alone, but for the prosperity of the Shanghai urban area, the municipal authorities cannot but promote it with all their strength. As for the restriction of electricity use, if it is due to equipment and fuel problems, it is of course not something that can be solved in a short time, or even after the war. However, the current situation of restricting electricity use is to restrict what should not be restricted, but not to restrict what should be restricted. According to our rough calculation, if all night markets in Shanghai are stopped and household electricity use is restricted, at least some of the factories that are in a state of semi-paralysis due to insufficient power can resume full work. This measure will not only help increase industrial production, but also achieve the result of implementing economy and reduce countless evils in large cities.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Schools at All Levels Cultivating talents is a major plan for the country for a hundred years. The rise and fall of talents are related to the prosperity and decline of the country. In the past, the "Concession" authorities did not pay much attention to Chinese education. The number of Chinese schools established with municipal funds was very few. The educational policy was only to create employees for the Municipal Council and foreign firms. However, before the incident, there were many famous public and private schools, and the children of citizens did not feel that the problem of schooling was serious. After the incident, the schools in the urban area moved to the concessions one after another due to military relations. Because of the difficulty in finding houses, they had to rent a school building together. Because of the insufficient time, they had to change to a half-day system. As for whether the lighting and equipment of the houses are suitable for school use, it is even more impossible to find out. This kind of makeshift method not only affects students' studies, but also affects national health. On the other hand, because of the continuous increase in tuition fees, many parents are unable to provide schooling for their children. This is the most serious problem at present and in the future. We hope that the municipal authorities can find ways to use many vacant public and private buildings in the first and eighth districts (such as the National Sino-French Vocational School in the eighth district and the barracks of the British and American troops in the first district) to quickly establish public schools at all levels, and use the best teachers and the lowest tuition fees to make up for the shortcomings of education. Recently, I heard that the municipal authorities want to restrict and ban businesses that are not very necessary for wartime life. If it becomes a reality, the school building problem will be easier to solve, and the number of schools can be increased even more. If the municipal authorities are worried that the expenditure on education is too much and they have to increase the burden on citizens, they can also expand the scope of subsidies for private schools and increase the amount of subsidies as a temporary remedy. However, the selection of teachers and the improvement of educational standards must be listed as one of the important conditions for subsidies in order to not lose the meaning of cultivating talents.</p>
<p>Improving Public Health Facilities Public health facilities are very important to the health of the mayor, and they are especially urgently needed for the common people. To give a few examples, in such a large city as Shanghai, there are still no public bathrooms, and the bathhouses run by private individuals charge very high fees. The common people, especially the women and children of the common people, have no chance to bathe at all except in the summer. Secondly, since the increase in the standard of living, the consultation fees and medicine costs after illness have become a serious problem for every citizen. As a result, small illnesses turn into chronic illnesses, and serious illnesses lead to incurable diseases. All these phenomena urgently need to be improved by the municipal authorities as soon as possible. The steps for improvement are</p>

<p>Terrible Scene of Naples Being Bombed</p>
<p>Naples, 13th (Central News Agency) A Reuters war correspondent said: The current Naples is very different from what it was five weeks ago, and it is almost unrecognizable. Since being bombed by the British and Americans, the most beautiful areas of the city have been almost completely destroyed. According to eyewitnesses, American planes dropped bombs from high altitudes, causing thousands of houses to become ruins. 8,000 firefighters in Italy's third largest city, with a population of one million, were mobilized, and German and Italian soldiers did their best to help, but the firefighting work could only proceed slowly. When I went to inspect the underground tram, the scene was extremely terrifying. Every underground station had become a shelter for thousands of people. Women, children, and the elderly were everywhere, with bricks and stones used as boundaries to create temporary residences. This underground shelter housed tens of thousands of homeless people. We walked in it for several hours. Fortunately, Naples is rich in fruits, so the residents can still taste the sweetness. People generally thought that the people of Naples would be depressed, but I saw that their will was becoming more and more determined.</p>
<h3>German and British Air Raids</h3>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Aizawa Stationed in Saigon for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Aizawa, is currently staying in Da Lat and is scheduled to return to Saigon on the 17th. In order to adapt to the situation, the ambassador has decided to work in Saigon from now on, which proves that the political center of Vietnam has shifted to southern Vietnam. Southern Vietnam is also the economic center of Vietnam. It is not only the main producing area of rice, corn, and other agricultural products, but also has the characteristics of a base in terms of military affairs for the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the position occupied by southern Vietnam in strengthening the relationship between Japan and Vietnam is extremely important. After Ambassador Aizawa returns to Saigon, the expansion of the Saigon branch of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam is highly anticipated. At the same time, in order to adapt to the real situation, Vietnam will definitely expand the political organs in southern Vietnam. Both Japan and Vietnam will therefore further recognize the political requirements of southern Vietnam and take serious measures.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to quickly establish public clinics everywhere, providing free treatment and inexpensive medicines. As for the selection of doctors, it can be stipulated that every practicing doctor in Shanghai has the obligation to devote part of his time to public clinics (work is still paid). Secondly, public bathrooms for men and women should be established everywhere, and the minimum bathing fee should be stipulated so that the general public can have the opportunity to bathe in both winter and summer. Regarding the establishment of public bathrooms, it should be noted that both tub baths and pool baths are prone to infectious diseases and are harmful to hygiene. The best way is still to use showers. As for bath towels and soap, they should also be provided by the bathers themselves to avoid the source of infectious diseases and reduce expenses. If the municipal funds and housing facilities are available, gradually increasing the number of civilian hospitals and civilian maternity hospitals will make the public health facilities more complete.</p>
<p>Dismissing Unemployed Vagrants Unemployed vagrants are the bane of social livelihood, not only hindering the appearance of the city, but also affecting public security. Moreover, in today's extreme panic over the urban food problem, a large number of vagrants should not be allowed to continue to stay in the city to increase the difficulty of the food agencies. We suggest that all vagrants who have no ability to live should be sent back to their hometowns. On the one hand, it can rectify the appearance of Shanghai, and on the other hand, it can increase rural production. If the municipal authorities can imitate the methods of various countries in the past to deal with unemployment problems and carry out major projects, such as dredging the Suzhou River and building sea dikes, not only can they train a large number of useful workers, but it will also be a great contribution to municipal construction.</p>
<p>Rectifying Social Customs The city is a hotbed of crime. The problem of social customs is an important component of the causes. Taking the recent one or two years of criminal cases as an analysis, few are unrelated to gambling dens and dance halls. Therefore, to reduce criminal cases and establish good order, the fundamental way should be to start with rectifying social customs. In the past, the "Concession" strictly banned gambling dens, and open gambling dens have long disappeared. This spirit should not only be continued, but should also be further investigated secretly from time to time to see if there are any disguised secret gambling dens. As for brothels and dance halls, they are also dens of extravagance, and the former is especially dangerous for spreading venereal diseases. In wartime, it is a time when every citizen should live in self-discipline, and it would not be an exaggeration to prohibit them all. If the municipal authorities, for the sake of the livelihood of the general prostitutes and dancers, do not immediately adopt strict and decisive measures, we suggest that the former should be designated areas for strict management and adopted a method of annual reduction. For the latter, the power supply to dance halls can be reduced and their business hours can be restricted, which are all temporary remedies.</p>
<p>Solving the Housing Problem of Citizens After the incident, the housing problem has become increasingly serious. Initially, only renting an entire building required a transfer fee, but recently, even partial rentals require a transfer fee. Moreover, even after paying a large transfer fee, the rent is still not low. It is said that the reasons for the difficulty in renting a house are: (1) due to hoarders renting houses as private warehouses at any high price; (2) due to some speculators hoarding a large number of houses and renting them out for profit; (3) due to the high profits from subletting, many people specialize in renting and subletting houses. Now, to solve the housing problem of citizens, the first thing to do is to restrict the houses supplied to the people from being used as warehouses, and those that have already been used as warehouses should also be ordered to terminate the lease within a time limit and transfer the goods to a formal warehouse. This measure is not only beneficial to fire administration and neighborhood safety, but also facilitates the investigation and management of economic administrative organs. Secondly, the past rental registration method in Beijing and Shanghai should be restored as soon as possible. Anyone who rents a house must purchase a rental booklet prepared by the municipal authorities, and strictly stipulate: (A) Renting out houses is limited to the owner or his authorized agent, (B) When signing a lease, evidence of property rights and a power of attorney must be submitted for verification. In this way, those who hoard houses and rent them out for profit will have no way to use their tricks. Thirdly, subletting for profit infringes on the interests of the owner on the one hand and oppresses the third tenants on the other hand. This is the most unforgivable situation. Because the price of subletting is unrestricted and the profit of subletting is too high, subletters have the opportunity to wait leisurely for a price and arbitrarily demand it. To eliminate this phenomenon, a reasonable subletting price should be stipulated so that subletters do not regard houses as rare goods, and at the same time, the loss of vacancy must be taken into account. The problem of housing difficulties may be gradually solved. The above-mentioned measures are still temporary measures to treat the symptoms; the fundamental solution is that after the First World War, when the housing problem was extremely panicked in various European countries, the local municipal governments, in addition to promoting and encouraging construction as much as possible, also made mandatory overall arrangements for the houses in the city. It may be worthwhile to study whether this method can also be applied to this city.</p>
<p>Promoting Urban Ruralization In wartime, increasing production is the first priority. Therefore, all land that can be used, regardless of its size, should be fully utilized and converted to cultivation for the sake of adequate food for the people. There are still many vacant lots in Shanghai, half of which are abandoned. In order to increase the agricultural products of the city itself and to adjust part of the people's food, the municipal authorities should conduct a detailed investigation of the area of ​​vacant land in the city that can be cultivated, make a production increase plan, and either order the owners to plant themselves within a time limit, or rent it to others for cultivation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are all within the scope of the municipal administration's regular work, and it is not difficult to implement them, only waiting for efforts. At this time when the municipal administration has a new look, we believe that the municipal authorities will definitely adopt the tentative suggestions to show the first spirit of the Chinese people after receiving the "Concessions."</p>
<h3>The Battle in the Kharkov Area Will Become More Intense Fierce Fighting Underway North of Kirov</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) A war report from the German Führer's headquarters stated: On the Eastern Front, the enemy, with the assistance of aircraft and tanks, launched a new offensive west of Krinskoye, the Kuban River bridgehead, but achieved nothing. Southwest of Belgrade, the enemy continued to attack. In the offensive and defensive battles with counterattacks, the enemy's continuous offensives were repelled. Northwest of Orel, south and southwest of Vyazma, Soviet counterattacks failed. South of Lake Ladoga, the enemy has gained reinforcements and launched a new offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) According to the news from Reuters military correspondent Mr. Sertori: The result of the Eastern Front summer war since the 38th can be summarized in one sentence, that is, the Soviet army did not achieve a breakthrough. However, we must continue to pay attention to the development of the war to see if the Soviet army can eventually achieve its goal of breakthrough. In the past 24 hours, the Soviet army increased its pressure northwest and southeast of Kharkov. This shows that the Soviet army has tried its best to achieve its plan, and Germany has also strengthened its resistance, but according to the German army's flexible defense strategy, the fortress positions have also been abandoned, because the overall situation is the focus, and there is no need to make excessive sacrifices in this area. However, the battle in the Kharkov area will become more and more intense. To prevent the enemy's breakthrough is the most important action. Germany must endure more, whether it is west of Orel or south of the Soviet offensive area, it must also be prepared to feel more intense pressure. North of Kirov, the war is raging. Between Kirov and Yelsev, the Soviet army has temporarily weakened. The Soviet army has fewer northern infantry, but more tanks, artillery, and mechanized units. However, there is no significant achievement. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army will not launch a large-scale offensive in a short time.</p>

<h3>Japanese Dispatch Army in China Announces Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese Dispatch Army's information department in China announced the weekly war situation on the 13th, mainly stating that the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in various places, and the situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army had previously learned that the 111th and 114th divisions of Yu Xuezhong's First War Area were attempting to infiltrate the Luxi area. In a preemptive strike, they launched a fierce attack on July 27th, achieving great results by the 30th. It is estimated that they captured the commander of the 111th division of Chongqing and many colonels, and killed more than 1,000 Chongqing soldiers. Currently, the Japanese army is clearing out the remaining enemies near Weishan Lake. Additionally, the Japanese army launched an operation on the 10th against the remaining communist guerrilla units entrenched in the Pingxi border area, occupying Mengjiang, North China, and the Rehe border. On the 11th, they completely cut off the communist army's retreat and tightened the encirclement, crushing their efforts to rebuild and communize the area. Furthermore, the US air force stationed in Chongqing suffered heavy losses in this operation and appears to be trying to recover and continue its counterattack. However, the Japanese army is on high alert, so US aircraft have no room to maneuver.</p>
<h3>Churchill Arrives in the US Via Niagara Falls, Rumored to Meet with Roosevelt Before Returning to Quebec to Start Talks</h3>
<p>Argentina's Capital City, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to reports from Quebec, British Prime Minister Churchill concluded talks with Canadian representatives and departed from Quebec by special train on the morning of the 12th, heading to the United States. It has been confirmed that Churchill and his party entered the US via Niagara Falls. However, the US wartime press censorship authorities have prohibited the publication of any news about Churchill's movements. It is said that Churchill may meet with Roosevelt in the US. It is also said that Churchill's trip is to welcome Roosevelt, and the two have already returned to Quebec together to begin talks. However, the truth remains unclear.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to an announcement relayed from Quebec, Prime Minister Churchill has left Quebec and is meeting with President Roosevelt in the United States. The time and place of the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill have not been announced. According to news from New York, Churchill arrived in the US by special train, and US news censors only allowed reporters to publish the news that Churchill entered the US from the Niagara Falls area, prohibiting all other reports.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Military sources here revealed that Stalin has sent a report to Washington through diplomatic channels, detailing the situation on the Eastern Front and his observations on future strategy. It is said that Roosevelt and Churchill will present this report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>Argentina's Capital City, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: British Prime Minister Churchill, after concluding meetings with Canadian authorities, is about to begin important meetings with US President Roosevelt. The main topics of the meeting are approximately two: the second front and relations with the Soviet Union, and promoting counter-offensive operations against the Japanese army.

However, the Soviet government is requesting a landing operation from the Strait of Dover.</p>
<h3>Strong Bridgehead in Northeastern Sicily, Axis Forces Take Important Steps to Prevent Aggression from Extending to the Mainland</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a military correspondent's report from the Hai Tong Agency: The current stage of the battle in Sicily is a well-ordered movement by the German-Italian allied forces to distance themselves from the enemy, thus the enemy has achieved stability in the areas they have occupied. The most important step now is to prevent the extension of the aggression to the mainland, which is the task of the bridgehead built by the Axis forces in northeastern Sicily. This position is stronger and more fortified, similar to the situation in the Kuban bridgehead in the southern part of the Eastern Front, where the German army has held firm for half a year. The smaller the area, the stronger the resistance. Currently, the Axis powers are hoping for the same effect in Sicily. The movement of the Axis powers is limited to two differences, and the central front remains steadfast. The counter-Axis army's attack last week completely failed. On Wednesday, British forces launched another fierce attack, but still made no progress. However, the US Seventh Army, advancing along the coastal highway, is tracking the retreat of the German forces and has now reached the Masu area. The right wing of the British Eighth Army advanced several miles along the road on the east coast. The German forces in the mountainous terrain of Mount Etna inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.</p>

<p>Geneva, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news from Belfast, several Irish nationalist youths were arrested by the police for holding military exercises in the vicinity.</p>
<h3>The New Financial System of Manchukuo (II)</h3>
<p>Organization of Ordinary Banking Business</p>
<p>Following the above-mentioned progress in suppressing inflation and mobilizing indigenous capital, financial institutions are also actively undergoing reorganization. The issue of integrating domestic ordinary banks was previously a long-standing case in Manchukuo's financial circles. Since last year, progress has been quite smooth. Representative banks have been established in various locations such as Mudanjiang, Yingkou, Jiashui, and Harbin. The principle of reorganization is to adopt a pluralistic system in large cities and a singular system in small and medium-sized cities, giving local finance a new look.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the issue of the Central Bank reorganizing ordinary banking business, this is absolutely necessary to fulfill its mission and establish a clear division of responsibilities among financial institutions. Taking the opportunity of the Central Bank's reorganization, this should be quickly and systematically implemented. As of mid-April of this year, the Central Bank had a total of approximately 20 million yuan in loans throughout Manchuria, with the financial business for the mining and industrial sectors transferred to the Manchuria Industrial Development Bank. Subsequently, in early May, the 28 branches of the Central Bank in the capital cities of each province and other cities transferred 5 million yuan in ordinary loans to local ordinary banks or commercial and industrial financial cooperatives. Furthermore, the Outline for the Establishment of the Central Cooperative Bank stipulates that once the agricultural cooperative fund is established, the Central Bank will transfer 83 branches in the capital cities of provinces and other necessary locations, along with their business, to the Agricultural Cooperative Fund, thereby establishing a truly central banking system.</p>
<p>The Manchuria Industrial Development Bank, responsible for financial business in the heavy industry sector, accepted the mining and industrial financial sector transferred by the Central Bank. In order to ensure funds for expanding production, the shareholders' meeting on April 1 decided to increase the current capital of 60 million yuan (of which 45 million yuan has been paid) to 100 million yuan. As for ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives, according to the Commercial and Industrial Financial Cooperative Law of January 25th of this year, the original 35 commercial and industrial financial cooperatives and the central association were reorganized and merged. The central association serves as the head office, and the cooperative units serve as branch offices, forming a unified new commercial and industrial financial cooperative, which began operations on February 1st.</p>
<p>In this way, financial institutions targeting heavy industry and general commerce and industry have been completely reorganized. In terms of agricultural finance, the Agricultural Cooperative serves as the center, focusing on short-term agricultural operating funds. However, long-term agricultural financial institutions are still lacking. Therefore, if Manchukuo wants to fulfill its mission as a food base and create the agricultural land necessary for increasing agricultural production and mechanizing agriculture, long-term loans secured by real estate are necessary.</p>
<p>The Manchukuo government is also quickly seeking countermeasures, investing 100 million yuan (entirely borne by the government) to establish the Agricultural Cooperative Fund. The outline for the establishment of the fund was passed by the Senate on July 8th and is scheduled to be established on August 1st.</p>
<p>The fund will undertake the agricultural financial business of the Central Bank and provide loans to 82 branch offices and agricultural cooperatives throughout the country. It will provide mortgage and credit loans to farmers and grain merchants. The method of raising funds is to issue agricultural cooperative bonds limited to ten times the capital.</p>
<p>The issue that is becoming problematic with this merger is how to adjust the division of business with the Agricultural Cooperative. The Agricultural Cooperative Fund is a financial institution for farmers, lending funds to the Agricultural Cooperative, while the central association of the Agricultural Cooperative transfers its financial business to the fund.</p>
<p>However, the Agricultural Cooperative will continue to carry out agricultural financial business as before, and the funds required will be supplied by the fund. The deposit business of non-members handled by the cooperative has also been transferred.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Agricultural Cooperative Fund, the business related to agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries originally operated by the Manchuria Industrial Development Bank has also been transferred to the fund. The amount transferred is approximately one-fifteenth of the total loans issued by the Industrial Development Bank.</p>
<p>Establishment of a New Financial System</p>
<p>In this way, the Central Bank becomes the issuing bank and the implementing agency for controlling finance. The Manchuria Industrial Development Bank is the mining and industrial financial institution that provides funds for developing industries. Domestic ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives are general commercial and industrial financial institutions. The newly established Agricultural Cooperative Fund is an agricultural financial institution, each moving towards completing its mission. In addition, with the branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank responsible for special product finance, the division of business among the various financial institutions in Manchukuo is established. Taking the reorganization of the Central Bank as a turning point, Manchukuo's new financial system is thus completed.</p>
<p>In order to implement the government's policies, the Manchukuo government and the Central Bank have established close ties with all financial institutions. With the Central Bank as the center, the Industrial Development Bank, ordinary banks, and other financial institutions throughout Manchuria have formed a unified whole. On February 1st of this year, the Manchuria Financial Association was established, marking a further step in the control of finance in Manchuria. (End) (翔: From "Allied World Weekly" No. 1218)</p>

<h3>Private Schools in the Eighth District Must Register; The Eighth District Education Office Refreshes Education Policies</h3>
<p>After the takeover of the two concessions, the educational administration has been reorganized, changing its previous tacit attitude. It is learned that the private primary and secondary schools within the jurisdiction of the Eighth District Public Office will be registered, and the educational office will thoroughly rectify them. Checking school registration is the basis for the school itself to obtain the basis for establishment, and it is also a required procedure (since the incident, inland residents have flocked to the mud, and the number of school-age children has increased sharply, so newly established schools have been found to be plentiful, but for registration procedures, they are often not held, which not only makes the establishment of schools without a basis, but also clearly violates education laws and regulations, so the education office will follow the orders of the Ministry and strictly order all schools to fulfill the registration procedures. All private schools within the Eighth District Public Office that were registered after the incident and before the return of the National Government to the capital must re-register in order to supervise them.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Bosco Salesian Society (5)</h3>
<p>In order to manage this German school, the Bosco Salesian Society runs schools for cultivating talents in various places, from the "Seeking Admission Institute" to the "Novitiate Institute," "Philosophy Institute," and "Theological Institute," and manages them strictly and perfectly. As for technical artisans, they are trained separately in technical schools or ordinary industrial schools. All teachers in each school are provided with clothing, food, housing, accommodation, travel expenses, and pocket money, without additional salaries. The monastic teachers have all abandoned their secular lives and are happily dedicated to religion, taking the education of suffering children as their lifelong career. Therefore, in their schools and in their daily lives, they are filled with harmonious emotions, universal love, and an enterprising spirit.</p>
<p>Where does the funding for this perfect undertaking come from? The Salesian Society has tens of thousands of societies, thousands of schools, and millions of students, providing clothing, food, and housing, as well as stationery for reading, and machinery, tools, and raw materials for crafts. The machines in the workshops of the Bosco School alone must cost millions. Originally, in addition to the educational undertakings of the two male and female societies, there is also a third society, the "Sponsor Society." Any non-religious man or woman can participate, as long as they are over sixteen years old, enjoy the reputation of a religious friend or national expert, and can contribute a helping hand (whether in kind, work, or prayer). This "sponsor organization" has millions of members, from the Vatican Pope to celebrities from various countries. However, since the war, they have been separated from each other, and the schools in Shanghai have found it particularly difficult. In March of this year, they requested assistance from the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association. Committee member Yao Zhong went to various schools to investigate and deemed them to be "spiritually special and well-managed," giving them a one-time subsidy of 20,000 yuan. However, recently, prices have risen sharply, making things doubly difficult. The principal of the Si Zhi School said: "In terms of food, the school currently has 120 people, and we need 14 bags of rice per month, but we only get 6 bags of household rations, which is not even fixed." The principal of the Yixin School said: "The school has 150 people, and we need 20 bags of rice per month, but the newspaper bureau approves 14 bags, and we only get 9 bags." The food problem is so serious, not to mention other things. Because teachers and students all understand the big picture, they are not often full, their clothes are ragged, but they are happy and harmonious; raw materials are lacking, production is stagnant, but workshop work and learning continue as usual. But how long can flesh and blood support them? The priests and monks have come to China from thousands of miles to relieve the suffering children of our country and train production cadres for us. Can we Chinese people sit idly by and watch them on the verge of collapse without lending a helping hand? (End)</p>

<h3>Opening Iron Gates to be Considered</h3>
<p>Plan to Open Part First</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Regarding the issue of opening the iron gates in the eighth district of Kunming Road and the South City to help the restoration of the entire South City, it was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. Obstacles at the iron gate entrances in various places have been cleared. However, since yesterday, the Garrison Bureau, after considering the results, believes that the police force in the two districts is insufficient and local security has not yet been fully restored. Therefore, the date for the general opening will be temporarily postponed. However, in order to promote the prosperity of the South City, it is now considering opening the iron gates at Tangjiawan, Heping Road, Xinbeimen, and Xiaodongmen first. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval before being implemented. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate announced its establishment, it is learned that all examinations of corpses in murder cases throughout the city will be conducted by inspection officers dispatched by the procuratorate.</p>

<h3>Spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department Discusses the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department in Shanghai gave a speech yesterday (the 13th) when meeting with Chinese reporters, stating in brief:</p>
<p>South Seas Area</p>
<p>In the South Pacific areas such as New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, British and American enemies, disregarding sacrifices and consumption several times greater than those of the Japanese army, continue to stubbornly resist on land, sea, and air. The decisive battles with the air force are becoming increasingly fierce. Furthermore, the American attack on the Japanese base in the Guadalcanal area of the Solomon Islands is the most stubborn. However, more than a month and a half has passed since the American forces began their landing operations. The American army's transportation lines have been severely damaged by fierce attacks from the Japanese navy and air force, causing the American army to feel increasingly tired and exhausted. Moreover, the American army is finding it very difficult in the jungle warfare against the well-trained and strong Japanese army, coupled with the continued discovery of a large number of people suffering from heat-related illnesses in the army, as well as the occurrence of mental illnesses due to the excessive intensity of the war.</p>
<p>China Area</p>
<p>While the decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces is becoming increasingly fierce in the Pacific, the Japanese air force in China has launched a fierce attack on the American air force stationed in Chongqing under the command of General Chennault. This move has not only dealt a profound blow to the American army but also to Chongqing. That is, the American air force stationed in Chongqing believes that in order to implement air strikes against Japanese soil, they must first gain air supremacy in eastern China through a decisive battle between the Japanese and American air forces. Therefore, the American army, disregarding all difficulties, is trying to increase aircraft and personnel and gradually increase its combat power. However, while its forward base was gradually being prepared, it was pre-emptively destroyed by the Japanese army, leaving the American army even more embarrassed. Chennault, aware of this failure, had a psychological impact on Chongqing, so he avoided announcing the losses suffered by the American army and instead made false propaganda and decorations. However, the great blow it suffered is difficult to conceal. Therefore, it is trying its best to replenish aircraft and fuel to reverse the situation. Since the Japanese air force began its operations to destroy the American air force, it has shot down as many as 44 of the American army's self-proclaimed P-40 fighter jets by the 31st of last month. Other than a few fighter jets, the American army has fled to the interior to avoid battle. According to news from Chongqing, Chennault, greatly affected by the results of this operation, recently rushed to India to meet with Stillwell and others to discuss countermeasures, demanding replenishment of aircraft, fuel, and personnel, etc.</p>

<p>Comments from Economic Circles</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>Because many thriving banks and money houses were once in a precarious state, people felt that the purchase of yarn and cloth caused fluctuations in the financial world. Fortunately, in recent days, the banking industry, mindful of its overall responsibility, made every effort to maintain stability in the city's financial system, achieving a "clear sky after the rain." This is truly gratifying. However, when there are fluctuations in the financial world, the pillar of support is not the banking industry alone, but the nation's leading banks. Therefore, yesterday, this newspaper telegraphed its hope that the government, in its consistent orders, would also consider the actual situation of the financial sector and provide appropriate support. This is what we meant.</p>
<p>But let's return to the point: after the rain clears, the financial world should engage in introspection. Introspect on what? Consider: does the large amount of mortgaged goods accumulated in warehouses before have the potential to stimulate price increases? Ask yourselves: was the acceptance of yarn and cloth bills as collateral not a thinly veiled ambition? Ask yourselves: is it in line with the demeanor of a banker to stipulate, in addition to interest, a method for sharing in the surplus when lending money? When reflecting on such issues, one can only fear increased regrets.</p>
<p>We have spoken repeatedly about the issue of self-discipline in the banking industry. If the entire financial community had truly considered its own conduct first, then all these problems would never have arisen. Even if they had, they would not have had any close relationship with the financial world. Therefore, even if political forces were to impose sanctions, there would not be any major fluctuations. In a nutshell, the Shanghai financial community, accustomed to the tradition of free economy, must strive to adapt to today's environment of economic control, rigorously practice self-discipline, and then can stand on invincible ground.</p>
<h3>Banks Need Timely Funding; Central Bank Continues Support</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the measures for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the state of unease in the city's financial community has gradually returned to calm since yesterday, as it is rumored that the Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, will continue to provide timely funding for the legitimate needs of smaller banks. Therefore, there is no fear of illiquidity in the operations of various banks, and all kinds of dark clouds can be completely cleared.</p>
<p>State of Unease Gradually Dissipates</p>
<p>According to a financial figure speaking to this newspaper's reporter, the government's measures regarding cotton yarn and cloth did indeed give the financial community a major shock, especially the blow to smaller banks, which was truly unimaginable. Due to the recent material investigations, banks have become particularly strict, and with the implementation of the method of purchasing yarn and cloth, materials are virtually in a frozen state. Therefore, warehouse receipt loans have had to be greatly reduced, and it has been particularly difficult for small banks to utilize speculative funds, creating an image of illiquidity and the danger of collapse. The rumors of small banks closing one after another originated from this. Now that the Central Bank is willing to continue to supply funds, the panic felt by the financial community can gradually dissipate.</p>
<p>Financial Situation Can Return to Orthodoxy</p>
<p>It is observed that the banking community in this city has been unable to self-regulate in the past. The phenomenon of participating in speculation is clearly evident. Many banks were established for the sake of speculation, using small capital to do big business, reversing the natural order, stirring up trouble, so that the speculative atmosphere became increasingly intense, prices soared, and the people suffered. This is truly because the banking community was accustomed to the tradition of a free economy, and once the steps of controlled economy were tightened, it was quite difficult to adapt, and its already unsound foundation had the possibility of collapsing. In the past, the government hoped that the financial community could practice self-discipline. Now, using the step of controlled economy, it allows them to be naturally eliminated or to reorganize their institutions on their own. In this way, the situation in the financial world can return to orthodoxy.</p>
<h3>The General Association of Commerce and Trade Follows Orders to Purchase Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council passed the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Guidelines for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth on the 9th of this month, stipulating that the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai be handled by the National General Association of Commerce and Trade. The association held a joint temporary meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 12th to submit a report. After discussion, it was decided to establish an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and the organizational outline of the office was determined. The chairman of the Cotton Products Industry Association, Mr. Lu Yusheng, was appointed as the director of the office, and he immediately began to organize the establishment so as to follow orders and handle the purchase matters. The organizational outline of the office and the situation of compliance have been reported to the Executive Yuan for record. As for the detailed rules for the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, they have not yet been issued by the Executive Yuan. The association has also requested the Yuan to promptly issue the detailed rules and Article 4 of the Guidelines and Article 5 of the Management Measures as soon as possible in order to implement them. It is also learned that the organization of the office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth is divided into five sections, and a verification committee is established to review and assess the quality and price of the cotton yarn and cloth to be purchased.</p>
<h3>Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued the rebound from the afternoon of the previous day, and the upward trend was even greater. The sharp drop of the previous five days reversed to par in one day. The atmosphere of speculation was thriving, and in the afternoon, rumors circulated about changing the methods for purchasing yarn and cloth, which further stabilized investors' confidence. Wing On Company, a department store, soared above one hundred, approaching 70. Sincere and Sun Sun department stores also rose by fifty points. China Underwear broke through 90 and then retreated.

New Asia Pharmaceuticals initially struggled within 100 points, then broke out at noon. In the afternoon, it traded at 80.</p>

Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company remained stable, Greater China Match rose by fifty points, the buying of public utilities also started. Shanghai North Water and Electricity stood out at 30, and China General Edison and Shanghai Electric Construction also rose by several tens. Shanghai Power Company at 33 had strong demand but no supply, resulting in a shortage of chips and impressive transactions. Cultural Publishing and Chung Hwa were flat, while Commercial Press and World Book had transactions below the previous day's prices. Wing Cheung Printing's purchase of stock after dividend payments also started, rising by as much as 70%. Standard Paper and Shanghai Paper Manufacturing also made strong gains. Jiu An Industries' dividend payment has arrived, rising to 70. New Asia Construction rebounded above 40. There were more joint bids. Lian Hwa Real Estate's subscription period has ended, and amidst a flurry of buying, the new stock is already expected to open strongly, exceeding the par value by 1.4 times. New stocks have soared to above 50. Shanghai Confectionery. Standard Monosodium Glutamate, and Shanghai Jimee Food are all showing progress on the surface. China Timber, China Clock Factory, and Shanghai and Xiang Sheng Tricycle are all showing strong performance.</p>
<h3>Rapeseed from Various Regions Arrives in Shanghai for Cooking Oil Production</h3>

It is now being handled by the military allocation group, which is contacting various oil pressing factories in the city to determine the contracting method. It is reported that the cooking oil has already been designated for use. As for the cooking oil for household consumption, the Oil and Grain Committee is currently arranging for the purchase from North China. The news was released at 7:40 last night.</p>

<h3>Mr. Tao Wenqi of the Central Market Helps with Scholarships</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Tao Wenqi of the Central Market, which reads: "Your newspaper is handling the fifth scholarship program, which is a great effort to cultivate talent for the country. I deeply admire it. The Central Market is a social welfare undertaking in this city, and it should share in this grand event.
