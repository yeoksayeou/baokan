<h3 id="c1">大東亞戰爭與中國興亡 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>上海廣播電合，舉行大東亞戰爭二周年紀念特別廣播，特約彬龢作首次廣播，爰於昨晚九時半，以本題略貢所見，茲並記錄，揭載於此。</p>
<p>英國曾於三百年前在印度孟加拉海岸殖民，開始侵略印度。荷蘭亦向爪哇西里伯斯等各島，逞肆侵略。彼輩侵略者，最初雖或藉口通商，而常於暗中施行壓迫東亞各民族。亞洲之悲劇，實發生於此。美國自百年以前，在加里福利亞發現金礦以來，其關心即集中於太平洋海岸，且其野心復越海而移至亞洲，竭力欲分割已化為歐洲各國市塲之亞洲，故意發動美西戰爭，從西班牙手中，奪取菲島，作為榨取東亞之立足點。英美以漠視人道之舉動及戰爭，在亞洲各地懸起英美國旗，實非亞洲各國人民所甘心。我亞洲人民均渴望得有一日，由我亞洲人之手，撕破侵時者的國旗，而代之以亞洲國旗。</p>
<p>英美侵略者對東亞各民族之覺醒，最為恐懼，尤嫉視日本之强盛。乃千方百計，煽動中日兩國相爭，相殺。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發之前，彼等企圖不用武力，即可使日本屈服。乃一面採取經濟封鎖手段，施以壓迫。一面即以所謂ABCD包圍陣綫之名，强化昭南香港之要塞，增强美駐菲空軍，復派遣威爾斯親王號，實行對日挑戰。蓋彼等之行為，不僅使日本之生存，陷於危殆，且欲永淪亞洲於殖民地之地位。於是日本迫不得已，為自衛計，毅然蹶起，以驅逐侵略者於亞洲之外，而有大東亞戰爭之爆發。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭既起，日軍即在珍珠灣擊滅敵人，繼在馬來登陸，擊沉號稱不沉戰艦威爾斯親王號，攻陷馬尼拉，佔領爪哇，進攻緬甸，長驅入西南太平洋，為時僅及半載，已將侵略者驅出東亞。最近在大東亞戰爭二週年的前夕，文有波根維爾島的大捷。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭兩年以來，我東亞各民候間，日益團結，如日泰日滿之提携，愈趨緊密。中日之間亦已締結同盟條約。緬甸，菲律賓，已告獨立。東印度人民亦得到參政權。自由印度臨時政府亦已誕生。至十一月五日，更有大東亞會議，制定建設大東亞綱領五原則，即共存共榮，獨立親和，發揚文化，繁榮經濟，貢獻世界進展。此為大東亞各民族共同之最高理想，更可證明大東亞各民族，今已打成一片，團結一體，為大東亞全體民族興亡而戰。今後更應努力以赴，爭取最後勝利。</p>
<p>目前我們中國同胞必須認淸者，就是五大原則之實現（即大東亞之建設）與完成大東亞戰爭，有不可分離之連帶關係。亦即如何爭取戰爭勝利，乃為第一條件，一切目標，均須集中於此。吾人更應認淸東亞興亡與中國興亡，實具一而二，二而一之關係，東亞興亡，固在此一戰，而中國興亡，亦在此一戰。</p>
<p>我最近去過日本，親眼看見日本全國一切趨向戰力化，傾全力使人的要素與物的資源完全戰力化。他們不論老幼，男女，都抱有「武力戰絕對勝利」之堅强信念。敵人之反攻雖愈趨熾烈，然而他們的實力，於敵軍反攻規模愈大時，愈可收獲偉大之戰果。</p>
<p>其他大東亞各國，如緬甸刻正在大東亞戰爭之西部戰綫，盡其神聖之職責。緬旬國正如一步哨，站立大東亞門前。如南洋各地民族，正在南太平洋前綫與盟國英勇部隊對敵作殊死戰，粉碎敵人之反攻。又如滿洲國，泰國，菲律賓，莫不矢志完遂戰爭，正動員一切的人力，捨身率公，開發豐富資源，以貢獻於解放大東亞各民族之正義戰。</p>
<p>反觀我們中國如何，兩年以來，尤其參戰將近一年，對於大東亞戰爭有什麽貢獻？對邦盟日本協力到什麽程度？我們不可諱言，非常慚愧。兩年來沒有盡我們應盡的責任，參戰將近一年，還沒有實踐戰時體制，實行戰時生活。</p>
<p>今日我想把我們當前的戰時課題，提供政府當局與同胞共同研究。</p>
<p>首先必須革新政治，增加生產，以解除人民痛苦，並協力戰爭。</p>
<p>必須使和平區的政治設施與經濟建設，超過重慶政權，以爭取全國民心·同時，消滅共產黨的陰謀。</p>
<p>從速設立民意機關，使人民參政，俾政府與人民打成一片。</p>
<p>應以上海為政治模範區，中日政治經濟合作的模範區，以為改革全國政治之先聲。</p>
<p>使人民了解東亞興亡與中國興亡為一而二，二而一之關係，認淸自己的責任</p>
<p>，進而自發地協力大東亞戰爭，與大東亞各民族並肩爭取最後勝利·</p>
<h3 id="c2">東綫中南部地區展開大規模戰鬥　斯摩倫斯克西蘇軍受創 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電</p>
<p>德元首行營頃發表東綫戰况如次：　蘇聯南部地區，克里曼卓西南方及柴爾加塞附近，德·蘇兩軍正展開大規模戰鬥·蘇軍除稍獲局部進展外，其他方面悉被德軍擊退，又蘇軍在某一地點曾突破德軍防綫，刻正賡續激戰中。　蘇軍在普列倍特河與貝勒基那河中間地區，突入德軍陣地，德軍當即反擊，將其擊退。　德軍刻在克里捷夫西方，與由戰車衛護之蘇軍部隊，展開激戰中。　德·蘇兩軍刻在斯摩倫斯克西方地區，展開大規模防禦戰，蘇軍於大雪中反覆攻繫德陣地，但為德軍予以重創，將其擊退。又突入汽車公路北方德軍陣地之蘇軍一支部，刻已被德軍殲滅。　德軍在內維里西方攻擊蘇軍陣地，擴大一部分地域，但蘇軍有力部隊又反攻德陣地，德軍即將其擊退，此役擊破蘇軍戰車二十四輛，另有四輛已不能使用。</p>
<p>義境戰况</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海道社軍事訪員塞托里斯稱：英第八軍進攻德國陣地，初獲局部進展，但共突破企圖已告失敗，美第五軍刻已馳往助戰。戰事現在第里尼安海與阿德里亞沿海二百五十公里長之戰綫間進行中，美軍攻勢之目標，似在茄達灣之沿海區域，克拉克將軍並欲推進其砲乓陣地，以便摧毀德軍右翼之堅强陣地。美軍在該處先以密集砲火猛轟炸，繼即在空軍掩護之下，實行衝鋒，德國以機關槍掃射，即予擊潰，克拉克現似欲以全力奪取禦特康米諾，該處在二星期前，英軍前衛進犯，曾發生血戰。英軍前衛全遭殲滅，該處陣地現仍在德軍手中，美國新兵，今亦欲奪此德軍山岳陣地，但遭德軍迎頭痛擊，所受損失極重，克拉克似欲不顧犧牲，繼續為之，以免再蹈蒙高茂萊未能獲得決定勝利之覆轍，但德軍現保有重要之高崗陣地，可以加以控制。</p>

<p>北平五日中央社電　華北全城汽車公路綫經華北交通公司年來努力開拓，現已達一百七十餘公里，共餘各地之物資增產與冶安之確保，買獻極大。頃又有新綫六條築成約一二百餘公里，於本月五日一起開始通車營業，共新完成之路綫計北京鐵路局管轄之（一）滄保綫（肅靑河間）約八十六公里，（二）高陽綫（高陽河間）四十一公里，（三）雄縣綫（趙北口鄭州鎭間）八公里，開封鐵路局管內，（四）陽武縣（陽武原武間）廿一公里，（五）濟　綫（洛一源蘇村間）五十公里，（六）新沂綫（新安鎭馬頭鎭間）四十五公里，以上各路綫開通後關於冀中豫北地帶之增產增道益堪期待，尤以滄保綫肅靑河間之公路開通後，關係津浦京漢兩鐵路綫橫貫連絡交通，嗣後　中各地年產之雜穀糧秣，物資輪送，必更形圓滑。</p>

<p>東京五日中央社電　日大本營業於五日發表波根維爾島方面之大戰，緣日海軍機三日曾在波根維爾島附近海面哨戒，在摩洛島西方海域，發見不成輪型陣北上之敵艦隊，海軍佔察機隊當電告防地。日海軍轟炸電擊機接報後即出動飛抵敵艦隊上空時，海面一帶已暮色蒼茫，敵艦發現日機飛來轟炸，一審開砲向空轟擊。此時日海軍機已相繼瞄準敵艦，某機過海面迫近敵艦，發射魚雷，其餘日機則投彈猛炸敵艦、未一刻問，海面上為猛烈火光所包圍，情狀至為凄烈。敵航空母艦二艘受日機猛擊後，當即沉沒，此外並有航空母艦一艘與戰艦（或為大型巡洋艦）及大型巡洋艦各一艘，亦相繼被炸沉，另有戰艦一艘起火焚燒，火光冲天，遂亦傾覆於海面，大型巡洋艦一艘，驅遂艦一艘，艦身皆已傾斜。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　美軍機動部隊司令納里克斯少將之陣亡，前已發表，茲據華盛頓電傳，渠當二十四日航空母艦「里斯科姆貝」在吉爾貝特島海面遭新潛艇擊沉之際，與艦長威爾特上校同時陣亡。據海軍部發表，即知美航空母艦「里斯科姆貝號」，二十四拂曉（美時間即日本時間二十五日）在吉爾貝特海面被日軍擊沉。茲據外訊所傳，亦謂該航空母艦已為日潛艇擊沉。據日大本營十一月二十九第一次發表中，有謂日潛艇於二十五拂曉，在瑪金島西方海面攻擊敵航空母艦一艘，曾予以重創，此實與美當局所發表者相同。敵航空母艦雖遭擊沉，但日大本營為愼重起見，僅謂其受重創，敵美方茲已自認該空母為日軍擊沉，此可證明日大本營發表之正確矣。</p>

<p>— 野村吉三郎</p>
<p>那麼，日美交涉是否自始即不能商量嗎？—回答這問話之前，這裏，必須略述美國的立塲，甚至羅斯福總統，及其周圍人士的看法。最近美國國務院所發表的文件，有下面這樣的話：「同顧過去十年間，這國家大部份的輿論，不以為欲洲戰爭對美國的安全有很大的影響」。過去十年間者，正指着戰爭開始之前的十年。在戰爭前的十年中，美國的與論！對欲洲戰爭威脅美國的安全，以至於軸心同不久可能攻擊美國的事，一向取風馬牛不相關的態度。「關於此點，大總統和國務卿實有遠見。他們早就相信，軸心國的政策，結果必至攻擊美國。」</p>
<p>諸此，恰似羅斯福和赫爾十年前就已知道日本要攻擊珍珠灣的口吻。一方面，說珍珠灣的襲擊是被驅·以欺朦國民，煽動國民；而在另一方面，却公佈這樣的話，露出馬脚。他們自誇有先見之明，或許在向國民說：日本，德國不是不出我們所料嗎？可是我們不要聽這種短見，這種跪辯。我也不信美國國民耳中一直聽得下這種顚倒本末的無修理的議論。</p>
<p>帝國主義者的傳統</p>
<p>其實日本何嘗想越過太平洋，欲攻擊美洲大陸？德國又何嘗想越過大四洋，欽威脅美洲大陸？日本所想的是大東亞新秩序。德國所想的是歐洲新秩序。無論怎樣反覆看戰前的日德的政策，決沒有越出這範圍的意思。如其說是開戰後的事，則跨過太平洋，飛越人西洋，現在在亞洲及歐洲出手的。不是美國本身嗎？</p>
<p>美國對英援助的根本，實在說來，乃是出於這一種思想：德國勞力如其經葬洲而述美洲大陸，則門羅主義就有危險，而泛美主義瀕於危殆。這思想自從以前德國海軍勞力僅次於英國海軍的時候就已存在了，當時美國為擁護門羅主義，努力建造「世界第二位」的海軍。德國是門羅主義的危險的敵人．現在羅斯福政權從迸見地所取的政策，與其說是羅斯福所初創，毋寗說是美國帝國主義者之傳統的政策。第一次大戰中，德國海軍消滅，這種思想自然也暫束之高閣。但德國在希特勒指導下勃興起來以後，威脅美洲大陸的是德國，這種說法又死灰復燃了，祇要是笑國的年紀稱為大一點的人，都知此事。如其把這說法推廣開來，則英國對德國的抵抗，也就是美洲合衆國的防衛。英國的戰爭，同時也就是自己的戰爭。在中立時早就決定援助英國的根本方針，以致造成今日的局面。</p>
<p>美國把這對歐洲的方針原封不動的移用到亞洲來。把日本當作德國，把電慶當作英國，他們對於重慶的評價，當然是故意的，可是出於日本人的想像之外，評估得非常高。大概美國的海軍，因德國海軍微不足道，故大多留駐太平洋說到太平洋的防衛，不待說，最主要的是防備太平洋的最强國日本。關於中國問題，和日本根本上意見不同。要推進自己所生張的門戶開放政策，無論如何須在太平澤中擁有强大的海軍以壓迫日本。從此出發，則援助蔣介石，自然也用和援助英國一樣的精神進行。一面强辯着說為了自衛，一面日本和中國相爭，互相流血。英國用攻勞政策，使使法相爭，俾自己得在歐洲自由行動，並支配殖民地，但美國更乖，利用英國，重慶，更拉攔蘇聯，使在大陸中出血，繼又在中南美，加拿大製造難題，使其就範。侵略金世界的機會到了，美國欲公然趁火打刦。（翔：評自十一月十九日至二十一日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>以波根維爾島作戰的開始為契機·集中於南太平洋方面的雙方海空兵力，展開了空前的大戰，自從二十七日敵軍在摩諾島登陸以來已有波根據爾島洋面海戰及第一次，第二次波根維爾島洋面空戰先後三次會戰。造成了戰史上無可比擬的殲滅記錄。敵方經過了道幾場戰鬥以後，似很長懼日本海空兵力的强大。茲將十一月五日以後到第二次布根維爾洋面空戰的經過，按日記錄如下：</p>
<p>五日　上午九時頃起，拉抱爾受到先後二次的空襲，情形恰如四日。空襲的敵機約有一百五十架。空襲以後，同日素敵的結果，在波根維爾島南方海上發見敵方航空母艦二艘，每隻配有直衛艦，分為二羣，作成輪型陣，正在嚴重的警戒航行中。雷擊機隊接奉攻擊命令後，立刻出發。薄暮奇襲成功，用魚雷轟沉敵方航空母艦二，大型巡詳艦二，巡洋艦或騙逐艦二。此即擊滅敵艦隊的第一次波根維爾島洋面空戰。</p>
<p>敵方似乎以為日軍為砍澈底擊滅登陸波根維爾島的兵力，已將强力的海空兵力集巾配置於〇〇某地方面，所以出動航空母艦羣。敵方航空母艦集團之出現於所羅門羣島正中瓜達爾卡拿爾島以北第一綫附近，足　敵軍曾有如何的準備，以及擁有大規校的海上兵力。第一次波　維爾島洋面航空戰失敗筱，敵方大起鞏慌，企圖增强波根維爾島的兵力派出了戰船羣和運　船團。運日　　從事困雖的素敵活機隊，動的偵察在七日終於邂逅敵軍一部分戰艦於摩諾島北方·八日晨又於托羅基拿岬發見敵船團的一部，下午更值悉并羅基拿亞南海而敵方大船團的行踪，並悉有以戰艦三艘為主力另配巡洋艦驅逐艦等的主力部隊作其先導，向托羅某拿呷方面航行。繼又發見以戰艦為甚幹的後續大部隊。接報之後，日本戰鬥轟炸大編隊即行白導强襲，出發攻擊敵船團，於是第二次波根維爾島洋面空戰開慕。日本戰鬥機隊在碇泊地上空與敵機六，七十架交戰，擊墜十五架：同時，日本急降轟炸隊則炸沉驅逐艦三艘，連輪船四艘．並使巡洋艦二艘。運輪船一艘起火。這　在困難的白畫强襲巾終於收得莫大的戰　。</p>
<p>受此攻擊後，敵船關即狼狽逃竄，北進中的後　船團和戰艦部隊也中途折囘，利用當時的陣雨，向後退抒。但日本电擊機隊依然緊追不捨，終在黃昏時分及，開始向其猛攻一戰鬥的詳細經過，因為已有報道，此處從略。線之，海軍航空　隊足以自傲的肉　幫擊之威力，在此戰中又充分發揮其眞價値，一舉轟沉了戰艦四艘是日清晨。</p>
<p>在展開了大空戰的戰埸上·戰續，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等大景艦船沉沒的遺跡猶很新鮮，海面鋪滿黑色的重油，說明了前夜的激鬥及日軍的戰緒。附近已　不見一隻船影。更向南下，在維拉拉維拉島南方海面，可以望到收殘的船團，巡洋艦·驅逐艦等正向南食島遁走。</p>
<p>敵方的企圖</p>
<p>維因第一次，第二次波根維爾鳧洋面空戰而受到重大損失，敵方似乎尚欲出動航空母艦及戰艦．以期確保制空權制海權，並國增强波根維爾島的補給。敵方既傾其　空部隊的力量，從事南太平洋決戰．臼軍當然不能因為有了波島海戰及兩次波島空戰的戰績就　然無憂，必須省悟敵軍將陸續派遺後續艦隊及機動部隊。從整個戰局看，敵方將傾死力於波根維爾島攻防戰，可說是當然的。為此，日本亦須繼續將強力的航空兵力送往前綫，庶可每次出擊每次都能擊滅敵軍。波根維爾島的攻防戰眞是所謂「來日方長」，而南太平洋的　戰今後亦將益酣。（門田海軍報道班員）（吉：　自十一月二十二日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c35">突破黑暗的天險　南太平洋血戰紀實 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>迫近敵人</p>
<p>部隊一直迫近　綫，始終沒有一聲槍聲。廻盪於羣山間的，祖有整備飛機的聲音。一出稜綫，敵軍才用自動步槍射擊。和敵軍的鉅離祗有五公尺。特特特，特特特，流色的槍口在眼前狂吼。這是密林中最有效的自動步槍射擊。在夜色中，澳洲兵的蒼白的臉孔像田中的白瓜般並列着。「殺！」一聲叱咤，跳將過去，手榴彈亂飛，自動步槍狂吼。「媽的！」士兵用槍刻亂戳。一顆手榴彈擲向大樹根，敵兵肢體向空直飛。到現在才有這一塲肉搏戰，眞夠痛快！而戰果也很可觀。在黎明以前，這個高原已歸我們。飛機已連夜逃去。鮮红的朝陽昇一空。</p>
<p>「一，軍人應尚武勇一軍人……」</p>
<p>向祖國的天際奉誦着軍人訓條的士兵的雄壯聲，音　盪萬山間，彷彿追擊着敗走的敵兵。</p>
<p>戰場上如秋天一般凉爽。習習的晨風吹拂着沾涵戰学的戎衣，沁人心骨。昨夜被戳的敵兵屍體，遺留在戰場上的非不少，大約在他們退走時已拚命背了囘去吧。</p>
<p>「由此看來，敵兵的團結力也相當强哪！」中村少尉視察着激戰的遺跡說。</p>
<p>僅少的幾且殘留着的敵屍，年紀都很輕。穿着短袖上裝，短褲，長毛襪，戴着闊邊　，用細紐扣住下顎，昨晚投擲了手榴彈的那邊的大樹根下，。有深約一尺的壕溝。二十發裝的手榴彈箱兩個一組地散亂碎裂地置每棄着掘株樹根附近都被手榴張炸得慘不忍視。</p>
<p>「黑暗中胡亂地擲了過去，想不到竟炸成這個樣子！」士兵們自己也不禁警嘆起來。</p>
<p>「班長，『駱駝』講頭怎樣辦？」</p>
<p>「好東四！拿來。」</p>
<p>一等兵拿來了兩三個盡着駱駝的罐頭來。</p>
<p>「比醃牛肉罐頭輕哩！」</p>
<p>「這小子，不是香烟一嗎？你難道不曉得？」</p>
<p>一等兵是不抽烟的，一看到了　頭便以為都是愈</p>
<p>至於駱駝牌香烟，這是〇〇以來才獲得的贈品　。班長原封不動地送到某隊長之前。</p>
<p>「『駱駝』罐頭。」</p>
<p>「想出一句妙語哪！」某隊長笑道。分給部下每人一文烟。在散亂的敵兵背　中，裝滿了襯衫，短褲，半肉罐頭，醃牛肉，乾麵包，火願，乾酪，剃刀，雲花膏，　子，化裝品，每隻昔　中都有許多女人照片。</p>
<p>那天夜夾起，敵兵會反攻四次，企圖奪囘陣地，但都敗憋於我們猛烈的火網下，殘留的幾個祇得邊向伊斯拉巴。</p>
<p>登臨咯咯遠台地，在一公裏的草原封面，密林綿延，向南一望，史丹萊山脈冷然雙峙雲間。別米拉諾峯，巴比峯，尼斯畢德峯，亞曆山大峯等三千八百公尺至四千公尺的高山，屏風似連綿重疊。連猛獸都不能棲止的茂生着幾千年老樹的黑壁，腐積着厚的落叶枯枝的深谷，惡臭撲鼻，正如遭遇到　瓦斯一般。「看去有點像日本阿爾卑斯拉裝上叢林哪！」兵隊這樣表現着他們的盛想。可是，仍難將它形容盡致。新幾內亞雖說是遺留在世界上的最後的黑暗地帶，可是日軍現在却現質地搶開了它的大門。在那灼熱的太陽也無法曬乾地面的密林中，日軍却開通了道路，這樣逢山開路，遇谷開途地前進。長長的隊伍，肩負着大砲，子彈和糧食，蜿蜓於叢菁密林問，攀登嶄峭的斷　時，軍靴的篇頭鐵釘扣打着岩石，發出爍爛的火星。一步一步，一尺一尺，行軍的隊伍在黑暗的地圖上畫着綫。追隨着這些足跡的，便是高砂義勇隊組　着血和汗的給養工作的肩背。</p>
<p>迂迴戰鬥</p>
<p>〇臼佔領別拉米路峯，繼續進攻伊斯拉巴敵陣。〇〇部隊出於　時到　，當即加入迂迴戰鬥。在這一役中，敵軍初用迫學砲猛轟。彼我雙方所　權關槍火，旋風似交流着。嘩啦嘩啦，嘎吱嘎吱，密林炸烈了，樹枝與土　飛　空中。火鴉高翔，漢烟直　，密林焚燒起來了。我們雖然一再衝鋒肉搏，敵陣却屹然不動。這因為此綫若破，他們已沒有再可　遁的地方了。前是火坑，從是油鑊，已是地獄無退路了！敵人一定是抱着這種心理的。所以祗要一彈藥未用罄，繼續着頑強的抵抗。天亮了。障蔽着彼我兩方陣她的密林，巳經葉盡枝零，裸出殘折的基幹。砲烟像漲霧般旋韓着‘敵兵出沒於塹壕，會白的顏面．因恐怖而擰扭，彈丸的暴風繼續狂掠地面。白書過去了。夜又明了。這樣日以繼夜地死鬥了天，敵方堅固的陣地的一角，終於開始崩潰了。〇隊堵住了他們的退路，我們一氣衝了上去，從白盡前後起，在前後夾攻中進退維谷的敵兵，紛紛中刃，發出最後的悲鳴，從崖上墜落。深不見底的山谷，張大了口，吞食了他們。接着，當我們從高地攻入伊肉達劍敵陣時，敵兵正在午餐，他們來不及携取武器，紛紛抱頭鼠竄。</p>
<p>極頂掛旗</p>
<p>苦鬥了〇天，終於在這要巓揚起日日章旗。珍貴的血流在朝陽中閃閃發出紫　色的光。已成廢墟的敵陣上，飄起了無數地圖的碎片。</p>
<p>這是向挨奧里比華進攻戰夜間的事：部隊正在山中準備夜營。從對面的林巾，兩個高大的人影向這裏移近．某隊長料想他們總是敵兵，打算如果眞是殘兵收卒，那宋將他生捕過來，漸漸近了。</p>
<p>「哈囉？」問道。</p>
<p>「哈囉」遣邊答。</p>
<p>「第六十八大隊何處去了？」他們問。</p>
<p>「天國去了。」</p>
<p>「天國」</p>
<p>「唷！」敎兵看清了某隊長的臉，大吃一駕，慌忙拿起自動步槍，可是某隊長的寶刀已砍下了。「把還二人　掉。」屍首埋了下去。天一亮，土堆上挿着－支小樹枝，上面一枚紙片，寫道：「敵　兵之墓」。</p>
<p>占領挨奧里比華當時，因給養綫遙長，運輸困難，携帶着的米已所則無幾，隊長以下各人，每日咬着草根，吃着樂　樹的芽，和缺乏奮鬥，與飢餓肉搏。</p>
<p>到此地為止的歷次戰鬥，雖確立了後方的戰略基地，但在孿越這大山脈的許多次戰鬥中，對於高砂義勇隊決死的活躍，實在是將士們衷心感激不盡的。他們雖和兵士一樣挨餓，却儘量節省自己的伙食，將米多一粒好一粒地運到前錢去，義勇隊員因為感激做日本御民的光塋，所以獻身於補給戰。他們將彈藥糧秣運到火綫後，即在彈雨中炊飯，伺候傷兵進食。並且到相距二臼里半（合華里約十里餘）的谷中去汲水，拿來灌滿士兵的水瓶。歸途更將傷乓運同後方。他們的辛勞，實不亞於前綫奮戰的士兵，對於今日正在新幾內亞戰綫及南太平洋基地從事補給和殷管工作，日夜流血流汗地奮鬥的高砂義員隊，非予以絕大的盛謝不可。（完）（四野特派員）（吉：　自每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 陳明</p>
<p>情：取自白茅第二十期</p>
<p>俞若文君小說「生的悲劇」地點：上海時代：一九四三年人物：阿明—三十多歲的工匠要—二十七八歲面容略憔悴孩子—生下來一個多月就從母親的懷抱中被離棄了東家太太！潑辣兇恶，祗願自已的舒適絲亳無人類的同情心</p>
<p>啓慕時舞台上正是傍晚七點鏡的時候，剛正太陽下了地平線，暮色一陣濃似一陣。阿明抱着孩子在一處里　口徘徊着，彷彿在等待着什麼。</p>
<p>阿明　（以下簡稱明）（孩子發出啞啞的哭聲，他似乎無急得不能忍耐了）孩子，別開，你媽媽馬上就來　奶給你吃啦別哭，好好地停一會兒　．（哭聲低啞了一些）乖乖的，等爸爸有了錢，叫你媽媽每天陪着你，不再去幫人家。等你長大了，爸爸買書包給你上學去，將來讀好了書，做個有用的人，不要學你爸爸樣一字不識，只會去做人家的苦銄匠，連家也餋不活的沒用的人。（但孩子啞啞的哭聲比上回掙扎得更豐了）唉！孩子！（正在這時小阿明的媽媽怎急跑來）</p>
<p>妻　孩子！怎麼啦？（順手就從阿明的手裹抱過來放在懷裏，一面準備餵孩子奶吃）孩子天天在　，你看已經　得不成棧了，—媽糕給他吃些麽？唉媽熱又是那麽貴，可憐的孩子！</p>
<p>明　粥水倒鐵過，可是這幾天就不十分要吃。</p>
<p>妻　（看孩子不吸奶就不　下去却又些雖過起來）不十分要吃麽？（淚水已經流了下來）小明爸爸，我看孩子有點不大好，應該抱去瞧瞧醫生。</p>
<p>明　孩子是有些病，前幾天我已經抱到醫生那兒瞧過了。</p>
<p>妻　聲生怎麼說？</p>
<p>明　聲生說這麼小的孩子，加上奶水有不足，營養又不好，—那很討厭。</p>
<p>妻　嘎！（放聲的抱緊孩子哭起來）</p>
<p>明　所以今天我想問你商量還是回去吧，等在這兒幫人家也沒有什麽意思。</p>
<p>妻　回去我們怎麼過活？</p>
<p>明　不回去也是苦，况且孩子的病少不了招應，还是回去再想別的法子吧！妻　暫時沒有辦法我看還是待在這兒，慢慢的積些錢來替孩子買點奶糕，找個醫生瞧瞧好毛病吧。孩子可多多的拜託李家好婆幫我們招應一下！</p>
<p>妻　暫時沒有辦法我看還是待在這兒，慢慢地　些錢來替孩子買點奶糕，投個醫生瞧瞧好　病吧。孩子可多多的拜託李家　婆幫我們招應一下。</p>
<p>明　那麽，你到這兒來已有二個多禮拜了，東家太太待你倒底怎樣？孩子偷奶吃的事她知道嗎？妻　唉幫人家做事就是吃了虧，也祇好把氣往自己肚子裏吞，尤其是這兒的東家太難聯了，喚東呼西的老是叫你不歇手，除了　孩子的奶外，什麼雜務都要你做，倒馬桶，洗眾布，洗衣服，上街買菜，回家燒飯，每天線羿得精疲力盡的，一直等服伴了孩子和東家睡的時候，才能息一口氣。假使找到了什麼小錯，東家太太的臉板得像吃人的野獸一樣，眼睛裏放着兇光死盯佳你，指手劃脚的罵着你，有時我眞忍不下。（稍停苦痛起來）我一看見別人的孩子在我的懷抱黠吃着奶的時候，我的心像碎掉1樣的更痛苦起來，我就想到自己養的孩子為什麼反而吃不到她母親的奶，一天天瘦下去，病下來，難道我們窮人的命運注定是這麼的苦命嗎？……　　明　小明媽我眞覺得對不起你，從來我沒有使你和我們的孩子好好的過一天生活，我是一個不能養活自己的孩子和女人的丈去，一想到這見我心裏像生了一把火，像要找什麼东西鬥一鬥，洩洩氣一樣，但是當看見你和孩子，…</p>
<p>我就想……　　妻　你想什麼？</p>
<p>明　不說了，我勸你還是回去吧。</p>
<p>妻　回去的事過兩天再說吧，現在時間不早啦．太晚了就有點不方便，而且秋天，早晚凉氣重；孩子是養不起凉的，你早些抱他回去吧。（把孩子拖給阿明，一面措著袋裏的錢）這兒是我積下來的一點賞錢，你拿去先替孩子上一醫生那兄瞧瞧，然後多下來的錢去買些奶糕　他吃。</p>
<p>明　（欲說话彷彿又說不出，結果抱了孩子預備走）。</p>
<p>妻　（正在阿明走丁幾步時，又跑去看看自己的孩子，道時東家大太閃了出來，她看見時大驚的喊叫了一聲）啊！</p>
<p>東家太太　（以下簡稱太太）好你倒有這樣大的胆，走到外面來　自己的孩子，我給你自由的走進走出原是看得起你，想信你，想不到你是這般的狠心。　　妻　太太！</p>
<p>太太　哼！怪不得我的孩子這兩天老是哭哭啼啼的，原來你想餓死他，把省下來的奶餵胖了你自己的孩子。好！我問你你是不是在要我孩子的命，告訴你，我暗地裏已經跟你多次了，今天可給我看見了啊！</p>
<p>妻　太太，我　麼會有這種存心，請你看我的孩子，因為有十多天沒有吃到奶水，已經生起病來了。我實在忍心不住，才抱來偷些奶給他吃，連今天不過二次……太太請願諒我一次吧！</p>
<p>太太　哼二次還不夠，誰道你老是要偷吃下去嗎？你這個不要臉的女人，良心　的人孩子生病死掉也活該。——</p>
<p>明　（耐不下自己的怒氣）你說什麽？妻　（抵住阿明欲進的身勢）小叫爸。嘎，太太，請你可憐可憐我們吧！</p>
<p>太太　（兇怒的視着阿明）哼，哪兒來的野男子，告訢你們都替我滾蛋，有錢會怕用不到人！</p>
<p>妻　太太，——　　明　你這個兇狠的女殺胚，我狠不得打死你。（衝進你幾步東家太太給這突來的打擊，有些懷怯了）妻　（拼命的抵住自己的丈夫，但發覺抱在丈夫手裏的孩子身體有些冰涼了起來，似乎這個小生命就在這衝突的當兒，祇留下奄奄一息的呼吸了）啊！孩子！孩子！我的心乖，……　　明　（也覺到孩子有了變化）啊！　　（東家太太做了一個懼怯和陰險的臉：已躲避了進去）。</p>
<p>妻　（從丈夫的手中抱緊了自己的孩子在懷抱裏，　下頭帶著無限的悲傷，漸慢的走向　裏的中央。阿明悲痛的緊跟在後面）孩子，我們的孩子！在舞臺上）（幕落）</p>

<p>— 純心</p>
<p>日裏隨着陽光消逝，夜裏接踵投入大地，那些忙煩的蠕动的為生活縣使的人們多在夜之來臨下，安靜下來，輕鬆地吐出一日間積下的悶氣，卸却了生活的重担，在沈重的疲倦下透過氣來，安逸地渡過丁黑夜。</p>
<p>夜，多麼幽閒動聽的一們音節，我雖詛咒一切黑暗，我却愛這為黑暗所包圍的靜夜．這裏，者不到忽忙，看不到戴着假面具做戲的人，所看到的只是一片無盡的黑暗，然而，天邊却有星星，有月兒，人們睡了。黑夜對於我所感到的只覺得說不出的柔順，靜的氛闡這迫得我搶不得離開它，似幼兒投在慈母底懷抱裹一樣。</p>
<p>日間我為生活奔波，忙碌，夜裏在可靜息的時候，却是我最逍遙自在的片刻，無暇思慮的瑣事都堆在這黑夜裏靜思，共實，黑暗的僅襲對於我並不慰到可怕。星星在盯着我徽笑，月兒的光時而在搖晃着，這已足夠使我勉力向黑暗苦鬥，向疲倦掙扎，何况還有更可愛的明日—有新的希望。　的工作，唯有在黑暗裏曾經强自勉力和它磨熱的人們，才會迫切地需要明日。</p>
<p>靜夜裏，撫心自問，一日間週旋於為世俗所釣心鬥角所用手　的旅伴間，可會使你失却了前進的勇氣；可會使你增多了一點黑跟在你那與天同生的澄潔底心雖上丫粗糙悲切的生活可會使你屈伏下來？在黑夜裏靜思的人兒呀—夜畢竟是你所愛好的，光明畢竟是你所追求的，在波過了你靜思底片刻後，再把那會擾亂你底心的丟出腦海外，拋向無邊的天涯，微笑地躺下去與明日相迎吧！</p>

<p>&gt;體育[P足球組形勢混　　東華隊獨占鰲頭　一警昨慘敗於葡萄黑馬出冷門勝僑聯</p>
<p>足球聯賽甲組前日昨天，有重頭比賽。週六　州　爲華人兩巨頭東華聯誼會師，結果東華以一對〇獲勝、昨天逸園。葡商勝一　，二對〇，得意之作，午後猶太竟以三—一克服僑聯，不可謂非冷門。如此甲組精形雖屬混沌，獨佔鰲頭，巳爲東華之天下矣。茲記其盛况戰情及評其作戰如后</p>
<p>東華勝聯誼</p>
<p>此戰非特攸錦標前途，抑爲爭華隊新主之役，振於兩隊盛名，膠州路上自中午起，以迄於下午六時，球迷絡繹不絕。一時半園門緊閉，雖預購者亦不得其門而入，人頭　擠，不得巳破門而擁，於是籬笆，場倒，場內秩序，早亦無地容人，東攀西爬，乃椅子反倒，籬笆傾跌，人聲沸騰，球迷之與奮，一致於此，初非　料所及，空前之盛況、比賽於四時展開，東華取其鋒之强，即行取總攻　，右襲左進，聲勢果赫，無奈聯誼後防森　、劉顯漢得保無恙，聯誼亦時有反攻，總以前鋒缺少練習，格格不入，拉　局面。上半時各無所獲？下半時開始後情形依然，球場之空氣，始終在驚險狀態中，唯均得保持過去、</p>
<p>在下半二五分鐘時，張林根得球，傳王錫勝，幼良在人叢中以手示意，小王準傳，幼良　上擺渡，鐵　地位絕佳，連跳帶奔，劉郞失陷—即此　貴之一球，奠定勝局！東華　天之驕子，不負衆望！</p>
<p>論戰局，以雙方球員，均有神經過於緊張之故，確少精彩鏡頭，聯誼以守爲本，宋靈聖取第三防　制防守；守來固見少　，進攻却不免散漫矣。東　攻勢雖多、亦以被困原因絕少佳作，宋則以人對人爲策，緊凑異常。評個人當推證福禎居首功，面面俱倒，而孫錦順之進一球，當亦應列爲首功之臣，其次以李寧之老練，幼良之奮勇，俱爲不可磨滅之事實，而邦倫雖乏表演機會，演來殊格外鎭靜。我云，孺子可以登堂矣。反顧聯誼吳祺鮮宋靈聖飛馳抬救，功實非小，而天生似有力不從心之概，阿奎良機頻失、義臣久疏球塲，大日疏漏，日前之敗〇對一。記者，頗以爲正如我之所料。</p>
<p>後東華自如能拒一　、捕葡商，痛飮黃龍，可以待矣，勉旃！</p>
<p>葡商克一警</p>
<p>一　勝僑聯五對一、僑聯勝葡商五對三。論之：應以一啓上勢、然葡商之作，本爲我人所雖料，乃以二對〇輕取一　，上半時一球爲老將　體脫攻入，下半時亦一球，爲新人勃拉達射進，均見淸爽美觀。而葡商後，之佳，　人　米迪，如磁吸石，　將難越，勞勃斯脫夫，竟被困垓下，英雄乏術，其所以收即基於此—觀此戰之葡商，進退有序，實有可觀，似大可與東華頡頑，然萄隊即不能如人理想，有時演出反常，不　一擊，將視其常日之悄况而定。</p>
<p>黑馬敗僑聯</p>
<p>猶太僑聯會面、衆以為事不容猶疑，勝者　　　聯，眞是天有不測風雲，賽有冷門戰績。猶太雖以老弱殘兵，　共餘勇，溫脫病中三球，僑聯　　克太十二碼，三對一，猶太初次獾勝利。</p>
<p>聯之收、確在乎人頭不齊，調整無方，中衛綫之前不能進，退不夠守。前　法凡　又爲其老伴侶　以　輕路熱之看法，無法活動。自以從何獲球耶？猶太之優，便是愈戰愈勇勇氣不餒，此所以能保持其『　馬』之春也</p>
<p>觀賽餘感</p>
<p>目下甲組形勢，各隊均有續，唯我東華，獨佔鰲頭！來日之努力。我人馨香　祝共一帆風順！</p>

<p>中國靑年會與堅靑團合辦之堅靑盃少年籃球此賽。上月初開賽、茲巳全部結束，龍華獲總冠軍。其比賽經過，不獨戰情緊張，抑且注意精神道德，故後無缺席棄權及不歡事件發生，頗足稱道。提倡籃球應從如此着手，故樂爲認之，及錄其全部戰續：計加入者有十五隊，分堅字，靑字，　字三組，其各組成績如下：</p>

<h3 id="c41">西靑甲組籃球第二週　巨人力劈二關　華影精神殊佳 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>西靑籃球第二週、雖無特出對抗，然各塲比賽、過程均　緊湊，可見各隊實力平均，局面不致過分懸殊，興　因以提高、何怪過有甲組比賽之夕，總屬座上客常滿也。茲　述戰况如次：</p>
<p>業餘挫大華（三十四—三十二）業餘雖以賈幼良缺席、稍受影響，但小心翼翼，努力以赴，卒以一球之差擊退强敵。大華最大弊病，在乎火氣太旺，記者前已述及，該隊仍朱能痛淪前非，故態依然，致失去罰分不少，不敗何待！</p>
<p>巨人克汕隊（四十四二十五）早在　料之中，惟汕隊以戰勝仁餘之餘威，聲勢煊赫、頗爲作爲，攻則以射遠得分，雖屬險着、　巨人守　嚴密，深溝高壘，雷池艱越，不得不爾，守則採用區城防衛術及、敵人球脫手、　事周旋，一絲不亂，故予巨人相當威脅。惜以長力不逮、收下陣來、共分數落後，係在最後七分鐘內，可以想見按　隊各員，年事方靑，朝氣蓬勃、苟能善自　勵，毋　毋念·則百尺竿頭·不難更上一層·　成勁旅、寄語汕隊，勉之！勉之！</p>
<p>華雨敗同仁（四十二—二十七）該兩隊均以聯絡見長，同仁近得足球名將張邦綸助陣、錦上有花、聲勢自壯，惟體格均屬較爲短小，近更以職務關係，缺少練習，不免見疏，其不敗於正在欣欣向上之華南者幾希。</p>

<p>現中北已正式退出西靑，不無使興趣减少，巨人遂亦少一强敵。此後吾人對於西靑籃球之滿腔熱望，其眞將全注於東方乎？▽每塲比賽，觀衆噓聲甚烈，尤以巨人戰汕隊之役，雖裁判員極欲解釋，以一檔千，無以爲詞。此雖或看客有誤會之點，然以此次噓聲之烈。依記者批評，因裁判決斷稍慢，有以至此，現本刊載　荷生之規則稿球迷大可拌爲座右銘！</p>

<p>乙親保聯隊，技術似尙幼稚、然據該隊教練金伯　表示：該隊將以精神勝人，雖明知或難逃殿軍之座，必能每塌振奮以往、此種精神、有足多者，不能不提一筆。（德）</p>
<h3 id="c43">國際·西靑　兩籃球規則之異點　西靑聯賽球員能觀衆應注意 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 劉荷生</p>
<p>本屆西僑靑年會所主辦之全滬籃球比賽、參加者計中國·日本，蘇、法國，菲列賓，俄僑、猶太等人民組織之球隊、共有五十四隊之多，所謂事變後全　第一次之盛大籃球聯賽、其華人組織之球隊、更佔三份之二以上。考歷屆西靑籃球比賽、因環境關係，所採用之此賽規則、時常輿國人所慣用之規則不同。本屆西靑仍採用一九四一年之美國規則、（日本華北及日本在滬　民，俱已改用。而上海國人所　用者，則爲一九三六年之國際規則，因此國人隊員或爲不諳規則而吃虧、或與裁判方面有所誤會，特在聯賽開始之時，將國際　西靑兩規則不同之點、略述於後、以告中國隊員及觀衆。</p>
<p>（一）遮板</p>
<p>國際　縱高一·二〇公尺，橫　一·八〇公長方形或扇形，以玻璃鋼，或硬木製成、（二章一條）</p>
<p>（二）中圈跳球</p>
<p>國際　中鋒在球未達最高點時，不得拍球，球未拍出前，不得離開中　，拍球至多兩次，球拍出後、未經其他人任何一接觸，或觸及地面或球　遮板前、中鋒不得再行觸球。根據上述，跳球時可共拍四次，即每一中鋒可拍兩次，其他球員應各站在球塲內，不妨碍跳球球員與裁判員行動之任何地點。（無六尺半徑外圈之限制）（六章六條）</p>
<p>西靑上半條與國際規則同惟下半條謂在中圈或罰球綫上跳球時，除兩跳球球員之外、共他球員在球未拍出前、不准進入六尺半徑之圈、犯者外由對隊在最近邊綫外擲界外球。（八章六條）</p>
<p>（三）分塲綫</p>
<p>國際　如球員將球由共後塲傳與站在分塲綫上之同隊球員時，則作過分塲綫論，倘該球員獲球後再傅與另一站在分場綫上同隊球員時，則該球作傳至後塲論。即分塲錢作前塲，亦可作後塲，視傳球之地位而異。（六章八條之注解）</p>
<p>西　　分塲綫及　於後塲部份，若球員從後塲遝球至分塲綫上，將球傳與站在分塲綫上之同隊球員·不作退回後塲論，因兩球員俱在後塲（分塲錢是後塲）而未曾從前塲退囘也。然在此種情形下、十秒鐘之時間，仍繼續計算。（八章八條註解）</p>
<p>（四）擲中·罰中或最後一次罰球獲中之繼續比賽</p>
<p>國際　擲中或罰中後、裁判員應將得分之數目及得分球員之號數，宣示紀錄員，然後應將球握持，交與失分球隊之球員、該球員應待裁判員指示繼續比賽之笛聲發出後、在共後塲端綫後任何地點，採界外擲球方法，繼續比賽。（六章九條</p>

<p>（五）決勝期之時間用籃（中等學校規則略）</p>
<p>國際　後半時終了時如兩隊所得總分相等應增加決勝期，每一決勝期爲五分鐘，如一期結束時，勝負依然不分、應再加一期。如此遂期增加，至某期內兩隊勝負判分爲止。每期終了應予以一分鐘之休息，決勝期爲從牛時之額外時間，但每期開始、應在中圈跳球並應易籃</p>
<p>（十章三條）</p>
<p>西靑　後半時終了時增如兩隊所得總分相等，應加決勝期不易籃繼續比賽、每一決勝期爲五分鐘，如一期結束時依然未分勝負、應再加延長，如此逐期增加，至某期內兩隊勝負爲止、每一決勝期以前應予以兩分鐘之休息、每期開始，應在中圈跳球並不易籃。（九章三條）</p>
<p>（六）暫停</p>
<p>國際　全局比賽中，每隊請求暫停比賽（祇有隊長可以關求），以三次爲限，但遇受傷或其他意外時，職員仍得接其額外之請求，准其暫停，惟每多一次，應作一次技術犯規論（九章二條）</p>
<p>四靑全局比賽中·每隊得請求暫停五次（不限隊長）。在准許之暫停次數以外，額外請求暫停者·作一次技術犯規論。（十一章四條）</p>
<p>（七）三秒鐘限制</p>

<p>西　持球之球員不能在木籃之罰球區域以內之任何部份，等候三秒鐘以上。在罰球綫至端經中間之區域內，球在同隊球員管束下，其同隊球員雖不持球，亦不能等候三秒鐘以上、（十四章十二條）</p>
<p>（八）罰球時違例及罰則</p>
<p>國際　罰球時球未觸球籃或遮板前，觸及或越過罰球錢，或延遲至十秒鐘以上、（十二章二條）</p>
<p>訓則——罰中無效、罰球一次者，不論中否，應在中圈跳球·如在述罰之末次罰球時違犯者，不論中否、亦在中圈跳球。</p>
<p>罰球時球未觸球籃或遮板前，觸及或越過罰球綫，或延遲十秒鐘以上。（十四章二條）</p>
<p>罰則—罰中無效，不論中否，由對隊球員從端綫後　界外球，此種界外　球祇應用在最後一次之罰球，若爲技術犯規之罰球，應在中綫擲界外球。</p>
<p>（九）替補員之犯技術犯規</p>
<p>國際　　替補員入塲在比賽朱繼續開始前，與其他球員交言（經裁判員傳言者除外。）</p>

<p>四靑　　可隨時交宣，不受限制。</p>
<p>國際　　比賽成死球時，經記錄員鳴笛後，替補員可立即入塲通知裁判員。</p>
<p>西靑　　比賽成死球時，經記錄員鳴笛通知裁判員，得裁判員准許後，替補員方得入塲替補，否則作技術犯規論，並於本隊擲進一球時不得替補，除非請求暫停。（五章三條）及（十五章四條）</p>
<p>（十）替補球員後之要求重立職位</p>
<p>國際　替補球員後不論多少，（替補員以五名爲限）俱可向裁判員要求對隊重立職位，</p>
<p>西靑　一隊同時有三名以上替補員入塲，方得　戲判員要求對隊重立職位。（五章三條下問答）</p>
<p>（十一）技術犯規罰球後之繼續比賽</p>
<p>國際　雙方犯規之未次罰球及技術犯規罰球不論中否，除下舉情形外均應在　跳球。如一隊受連罰，而其中至少有一次爲侵人犯規之罰球者，則最後一次罰球不中時，應繼續比賽。</p>
<p>四靑　其他與國際同，惟技術犯規之罰球後不論中否、俱擲罰球隊之隊員由中錢處，擲界外球繼續比賽。</p>
<p>（十二）擲罰球</p>
<p>國際　任何罰球必須照章擲、</p>
<p>西靑　　論技術或　人犯規之一次罰球或述罰之最後一次罰球，擲罰球隊隊長，可要求放棄罰球而改在中綫處，擲界外球。</p>
<p>（十三）擲籃時犯規之罰球</p>
<p>國際　球員正在擲籃時，對方犯侵人犯規者，如該球因此未能擲中，應罰二球。如該球依然擲中而有效者，則僅罰一球，（十三章十三條罰則一）</p>
<p>西靑　球員正在擲籃時對方犯侵人犯規者，如該球因此未能擲中，應罰兩球。如該球依然一擲中而有效者，則僅罰一球。然該犯規者舉動組魯，有意侵人雖擲中亦得罰兩球。</p>
<p>（十四）「觸球」之犯技術犯規</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Greater East Asia War and China's Rise and Fall <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting and Television Association held a special broadcast to commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It specially invited Binhe to give his first broadcast, and he briefly contributed his views on this topic at 9:30 last night. The recording is hereby published.</p>
<p>England colonized the coast of Bengal, India, three hundred years ago, and began its invasion of India. The Netherlands also wantonly invaded various islands such as Java and Celebes. Although these invaders initially made excuses for trade, they often secretly oppressed the various peoples of East Asia. The tragedy of Asia actually began here. Since the discovery of gold mines in California a hundred years ago, the United States has focused its attention on the Pacific coast, and its ambition has crossed the sea to Asia, trying its best to divide Asia, which has been transformed into the market of European countries. It deliberately launched the Spanish-American War, seizing the Philippines from Spain as a base for extracting resources from East Asia. The raising of British and American flags in various parts of Asia by Britain and the United States through inhumane actions and wars was certainly not what the people of various Asian countries were willing to accept. Our Asian people all long for the day when we Asians will tear down the national flags of the invaders and replace them with Asian flags.</p>
<p>The British and American invaders were most afraid of the awakening of the East Asian nations, and especially jealous of Japan's strength. They tried every means to incite China and Japan to fight and kill each other.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they attempted to subdue Japan without resorting to force. On the one hand, they adopted economic blockade measures to exert pressure. On the other hand, they strengthened the fortresses of Chao Nan and Hong Kong under the name of the so-called ABCD encirclement, strengthened the U.S. air force stationed in the Philippines, and dispatched the Prince of Wales to challenge Japan. Their actions not only endangered Japan's survival, but also sought to forever consign Asia to the status of a colony. Therefore, Japan was forced to rise up resolutely for the sake of self-defense and to expel the invaders from Asia, resulting in the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Once the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese army annihilated the enemy at Pearl Harbor, then landed in Malaya, sank the so-called unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales, captured Manila, occupied Java, and attacked Burma, driving straight into the Southwest Pacific. In just half a year, it had driven the invaders out of East Asia. Most recently, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, there was the great victory on Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>In the two years since the Greater East Asia War, the peoples of East Asia have become increasingly united. The cooperation between Japan and Thailand and Japan and Manchuria has become closer. China and Japan have also concluded an alliance treaty. Burma and the Philippines have declared independence. The people of East India have also gained the right to participate in politics. The Provisional Government of Free India has also been established. On November 5th, there was even the Greater East Asia Conference, which formulated the five principles of the Greater East Asia Construction Program, namely, coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world progress. This is the common highest ideal of the various nations of Greater East Asia, and it further proves that the various nations of Greater East Asia have now become one, united as one, and are fighting for the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia. In the future, we should work harder to strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>What we Chinese compatriots must recognize at present is that the realization of the five major principles (i.e., the construction of Greater East Asia) is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. That is, how to win the war is the first condition, and all goals must be focused on this. We should also recognize that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are in fact one and two, and two and one. The rise and fall of East Asia is in this one battle, and the rise and fall of China is also in this one battle.</p>
<p>I recently went to Japan and saw with my own eyes that the entire country of Japan is trending towards militarization, devoting all its efforts to fully militarizing human elements and material resources. Whether old or young, male or female, they all hold a firm belief in "absolute victory in the war of force." Although the enemy's counterattack is becoming more and more fierce, their strength can reap greater battle results when the scale of the enemy's counterattack is greater.</p>
<p>Other Greater East Asian countries, such as Burma, are currently fulfilling their sacred responsibilities on the western front of the Greater East Asia War. Burma is like a sentry standing in front of the gate of Greater East Asia. The nationalities in various places in the South Seas, for example, are fighting bravely against the allied British troops on the front lines of the South Pacific, crushing the enemy's counterattacks. And countries such as Manchuria, Thailand, and the Philippines are all determined to complete the war, mobilizing all their manpower, sacrificing themselves for the public good, and developing abundant resources to contribute to the just war of liberating the various nations of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Looking back at our China, what contributions have we made to the Greater East Asia War in the past two years, especially since we joined the war nearly a year ago? To what extent have we cooperated with our allied Japan? We cannot deny that we are very ashamed. We have not fulfilled our due responsibilities in the past two years, and we have not yet implemented a wartime system or lived a wartime life in the nearly one year since we joined the war.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to offer our current wartime issues to the government authorities and compatriots for joint study.</p>
<p>First of all, we must reform politics and increase production to relieve the people's suffering and cooperate in the war.</p>
<p>We must make the political facilities and economic construction of the peaceful areas surpass the Chongqing regime to win the hearts of the people across the country. At the same time, we must eliminate the Communist Party's conspiracy.</p>
<p>We should establish a civil opinion organ as soon as possible so that the people can participate in politics, so that the government and the people can become one.</p>
<p>Shanghai should be used as a political model area and a model area for Sino-Japanese political and economic cooperation to set an example for reforming the politics of the entire country.</p>
<p>Make the people understand that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one, and recognize their responsibilities.</p>
<p>, and then spontaneously cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and strive for the final victory alongside the various nations of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Large-Scale Battles Unfold in the Central and Southern Sections of the Eastern Front, Soviet Troops West of Smolensk Suffer Heavy Losses <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th</p>
<p>The German Supreme Headquarters recently issued the following report on the Eastern Front: In the southern region of the Soviet Union, large-scale battles are unfolding southwest of Krimandol and near Zyrkasse. The Soviet troops have suffered losses everywhere except for some local gains, and have been repelled by German forces. Furthermore, the Soviet troops had once broken through the German defense line in one location, and fierce battles are still continuing. Soviet troops broke into German positions in the area between the Prebet River and the Belerkina River, but were immediately counterattacked and repulsed by German forces. German troops are currently engaged in fierce battles with Soviet units guarded by tanks west of Krychev. German and Soviet troops are currently engaged in a large-scale defensive war in the area west of Smolensk. Soviet troops repeatedly attacked German positions in heavy snow, but were heavily damaged and repulsed by German forces. Furthermore, a Soviet detachment that had broken into the German positions north of the highway has now been annihilated by German forces. German troops attacked Soviet positions west of Nevel, expanding a portion of the area. However, strong Soviet units counterattacked German positions, and the German troops repulsed them. In this battle, 24 Soviet tanks were destroyed, and another four were rendered unusable.</p>
<p>Situation on the Italian Front</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th A military correspondent for the Overseas Communications Association, Sytoris, claims that the British Eighth Army's attack on German positions initially achieved some local gains, but its overall breakthrough attempt has failed. The American Fifth Army has now rushed to assist in the battle. The war is now taking place along a 250-kilometer battle line between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic coast. The objective of the American offensive seems to be the coastal area of Gaeta Bay. General Clark also wants to advance his artillery positions in order to destroy the strong positions on the German right flank. The American troops first bombarded the area with intensive artillery fire, followed by a charge under the cover of the air force. However, they were repulsed by German machine gun fire. Clark now seems to want to seize Monte Camino at all costs. A bloody battle took place there two weeks ago when the British vanguard attacked. The entire British vanguard was annihilated, and the position is still in German hands. American recruits now also want to seize this German mountain position, but were met with a head-on blow from German forces and suffered heavy losses. Clark seems willing to continue regardless of sacrifices in order to avoid repeating the failure of Monte Maggiore in achieving a decisive victory. However, the German troops currently hold important high ground positions that can be controlled.</p>
<h3 id="e3">North China Communist Suppression Headquarters Ready for Reform <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th After the North China Political Affairs Commission reformed its structure, the personnel of its relevant agencies have been reformed one after another in order to comply with the central government's intentions and smoothly promote administrative efficiency. The North China Communist Suppression Committee Headquarters is the central promotion agency for North China's construction work. This time, it has also reorganized its organization in accordance with the principle of concentrating manpower. The newly appointed Standing Committee member, Mr. Rong Zhen, took office yesterday morning and convened all staff members to explain the significance of reforming the organization, urging them to work diligently for the public good, in order to live up to the central government's expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e4">New Sections of North China Automobile Highway Open to Traffic <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th The North China Automobile Highway Line, which has been diligently developed by the North China Transportation Company over the years, has now reached more than 170 kilometers, making great contributions to the increased production of materials in various places and the security of governance. Recently, six new lines have been built, totaling about 100 to 200 kilometers, and they were all opened to traffic on the 5th of this month. The newly completed routes include (1) the Cangbao Line (between Suqinghe) under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Railway Bureau, about 86 kilometers, (2) the Gaoyang Line (between Gaoyanghe) 41 kilometers, (3) the Xiongxian Line (between Zhaobeikou Zhengzhou Town) 8 kilometers, (4) Yangwu County (between Yangwu Yuanwu) under the jurisdiction of the Kaifeng Railway Bureau, 21 kilometers, (5) the Ji Line (between Luoyiyuan Sucun) 50 kilometers, (6) the Xinyi Line (between Xin'anzhen Matouzhen) 45 kilometers. After the opening of the above routes, the increased production in the Jizhong and northern Henan areas can be expected, especially after the opening of the Cangbao Line between Suqinghe, which is related to the horizontal connection between the Jinpu and Jinghan railway lines.

<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th: On the evening of the 3rd, Japanese naval air units attacked the enemy's mobile unit on the sea south of Bougainville Island, and the battle results were as follows: Three enemy aircraft carriers were sunk (two of which were sunk by bombing), one battleship or large cruiser, three large cruisers, one battleship destroyed (heavily damaged and burned), one large cruiser (probably sunk), one destroyer (probably sunk). The Japanese side's losses totaled ten aircraft that did not return. (Note) This air battle is called the Sixth Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 5th that the great battle on Bougainville Island was due to the fact that Japanese naval aircraft had been patrolling the sea near Bougainville Island on the 3rd. In the waters west of Moro Island, an enemy fleet was discovered heading north in an incomplete circular formation. The naval reconnaissance aircraft immediately telegraphed the defense. When Japanese naval bombers and torpedo planes were dispatched after receiving the report and flew to the enemy fleet, the sea was already shrouded in twilight. The enemy ships discovered the Japanese aircraft bombing and opened fire into the air. At this time, Japanese naval aircraft successively aimed at the enemy ships. A certain aircraft approached the enemy ship over the sea and launched a torpedo, while the remaining Japanese aircraft bombed the enemy ship fiercely. In a short while, the sea was surrounded by fierce fire, and the situation was extremely tragic. Two enemy aircraft carriers sank immediately after being attacked by Japanese aircraft. In addition, one aircraft carrier and one battleship (or large cruiser) and one large cruiser were also sunk one after another. Another battleship caught fire and burned, the flames soaring into the sky, and it also capsized on the sea. The hulls of one large cruiser and one destroyer were all tilted.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 4th: British aircraft bombed Leipzig on the morning of the 4th, dropping bombs on public buildings, cultural monuments, etc. At the same time, the British air force also attacked Berlin, but did not suffer any losses.

<h3 id="e8">Commander of U.S. Mobile Unit, General Narikes, Killed in Action —Captain of Welte Shared His Fate— <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 5th The death of U.S. Mobile Unit Commander Major General Narikes has already been announced. According to a Washington dispatch, he died on the 24th when the aircraft carrier "Liscombe Bay" was sunk by a new submarine in the sea off the Gilbert Islands, along with Captain Welte. According to a Navy Department announcement, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Liscombe Bay" was sunk by the Japanese army in the Gilbert Sea at dawn on the 24th (U.S. time, i.e., Japanese time on the 25th). According to foreign dispatches, the aircraft carrier was also sunk by a Japanese submarine. In the first announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on November 29, it was said that a Japanese submarine attacked an enemy aircraft carrier in the sea west of Makin Island at dawn on the 25th and inflicted heavy damage on it. This is actually the same as what the U.S. authorities announced. Although the enemy aircraft carrier was sunk, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, for the sake of caution, only said that it was heavily damaged. The enemy U.S. side has now admitted that the aircraft carrier was sunk by the Japanese army, which proves the accuracy of the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 5th German News Agency: It is reported in Ankara political and diplomatic circles that Turkish President Ismet has gone to Cairo to meet with President Roosevelt, but no official statement has been issued. To protect the Turkish president, all domestic and foreign news communications were completely suspended on Friday morning and only resumed at noon on Saturday.

Turkish political circles believe that the meeting between the Turkish President and the U.S. President will not affect Turkey's foreign policy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Istanbul, 5th Haitong News Agency: Istanbul newspapers report that there has been a slight earthquake in Anatolian, with wind and clouds. The telephone lines between Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir have been interrupted.

<h3 id="e13">Regarding the Protest Against Sweden, German Foreign Minister Declares Hope That It Will Not Interfere in German-Norwegian Affairs <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th Haitong News Agency: It is officially announced here that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, regarding the arrest of Oslo University students for engaging in conspiracy activities, and the Swedish Foreign Minister's protest to the German envoy to Sweden, specifically received the Danish Chargé d'affaires to Germany, Buschde, and informed him that the German government hopes that the Danish government will not interfere in German-Norwegian affairs in the future. At the same time, representing the German government, he expressed deep surprise at the Swedish government's diplomatic protest against the measures taken by German troops stationed in Norway to ensure local security. Moreover, the British, American and Soviet countries constantly take actions that harm the interests of the Scandinavian Group, such as the British attack on Norway and the Soviet deportation of large numbers of men, women and children from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and other countries, but Sweden has never expressed a protest. Now, it is even more surprising to negotiate with Germany this time. Furthermore, Sweden and Finland were originally neighboring countries, but Sweden did not express the slightest sympathy for Finland's heroic resistance, which is also somewhat inhumane. Now, the war has long been approaching Sweden's borders. Its national security is fortunately relying on the German army to protect it, but the Swedish government is now taking such an attitude. It is really puzzling.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Soccer Upsets - Portuguese Merchants Beat One Police, Overseas Chinese United Lose to Jews <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's two甲組 soccer league games both resulted in upsets, which can be said to be a coincidence. In the game between Portuguese Merchants and One Police, which took place at Yiyuan Wensui at 10:30 AM, the Portuguese team defeated One Police 2-0. In the other game, which was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM, Overseas Chinese United surprisingly lost to the Jews 1-3 despite having an absolute advantage. The收 of One Police indirectly benefits the Eastern China team. From now on, the only undefeated team in甲組 is the Eastern China team.</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants Defeat One Police: In the game between Portuguese Merchants and One Police, veteran players such as Gaien and Su Ruo were not present yesterday. However, with the assistance of Remidi, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, their strength was greatly increased. One Police was suppressed by Aulierweila, which resulted in a one-sided match. Bao Xituo scored a header, taking the lead in the first half. The Portuguese team maintained the lead with this one goal. In the second half, Bola Da scored another goal, and the Portuguese Merchants defeated One Police with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese United Lost to Jews: The match was held at Liaozhou Public Park. Overseas Chinese United had previously defeated Portuguese Merchants, and everyone expected that the Jews would not be their opponents. However, the players played poorly and performed abnormally. The Jews were unusually brave. Wenduo scored the first goal, and Overseas Chinese United fell behind by one goal in the first half. In the second half, the Jewish Wenduo scored twice again, creating a score of 3-0. At this time, the Jewish player Shouya was injured and left the field. Shaman Bawa was anxious and touched the ball with his hand, which resulted in a penalty kick. Overseas Chinese United's Weiketai took the penalty kick and scored a goal. In the end, Overseas Chinese United lost 1-3.</p>

<p>— Nomura Kichisaburo</p>
<p>So, was it impossible to negotiate between Japan and the United States from the beginning? — Before answering this question, it is necessary to briefly describe the position of the United States, even the views of President Roosevelt and those around him. A recent document published by the US State Department contains the following statement: "Looking back over the past ten years, most of the opinion in this country did not think that the European war had a great impact on the security of the United States." The past ten years refers to the ten years before the start of the war. During the ten years before the war, American public opinion! Regarding the European war threatening the security of the United States, to the point that the Axis powers might soon attack the United States, they have always taken an indifferent attitude. "Regarding this point, the President and the Secretary of State were truly far-sighted. They believed early on that the policies of the Axis powers would inevitably lead to an attack on the United States."</p>
<p>All of this sounds as if Roosevelt and Hull had known ten years ago that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. On the one hand, they say that the attack on Pearl Harbor was driven by a desire to deceive the people and incite national sentiment; but on the other hand, they publish such statements, revealing their hypocrisy. They boast of their foresight, perhaps to say to the people: "Didn't Japan and Germany turn out exactly as we expected?" But we should not listen to such short-sightedness, such quibbling. I also do not believe that the American people will continue to listen to such nonsensical arguments that turn things upside down.</p>
<p>The Tradition of Imperialists</p>
<p>In reality, did Japan ever want to cross the Pacific Ocean and attack the American continent? Did Germany ever want to cross the Atlantic Ocean and threaten the American continent? What Japan wanted was a new order in Greater East Asia. What Germany wanted was a new order in Europe. No matter how many times you look back at the pre-war policies of Japan and Germany, there was no intention to go beyond this scope. If you are talking about what happened after the war started, then who is it that has crossed the Pacific Ocean and flown over the Atlantic Ocean, and is now intervening in Asia and Europe? Isn't it the United States itself?</p>
<p>The basis of American aid to Britain, in reality, stems from the following idea: If German labor were to traverse Europe and threaten the American continent, then the Monroe Doctrine would be in danger, and Pan-Americanism would be on the verge of collapse. This idea has existed since the days when German naval power was second only to that of Britain. At that time, in order to uphold the Monroe Doctrine, the United States strove to build the "second-largest navy in the world." Germany was a dangerous enemy of the Monroe Doctrine. The policy taken by the Roosevelt administration from the beginning was not something that Roosevelt created, but rather the traditional policy of American imperialists. During World War I, the German navy was destroyed, and this idea naturally went into temporary storage. But after Germany rose up again under the leadership of Hitler, the notion that Germany was threatening the American continent was revived. Anyone in America who is old enough knows this. If this argument is extended, then Britain's resistance to Germany is also the defense of the United States of America. Britain's war is also its own war. The fundamental policy of aiding Britain was decided early on during neutrality, leading to the situation today.</p>
<p>The United States transferred this policy toward Europe to Asia without changing it. They treated Japan as Germany, and 电庆 as Britain. Their evaluation of 重庆 was certainly intentional, but it was much higher than the Japanese imagined. Perhaps the US Navy, because the German Navy was negligible, mostly remained in the Pacific. Speaking of the defense of the Pacific, it goes without saying that the most important thing is to defend against Japan, the strongest country in the Pacific. Regarding the China issue, their opinions were fundamentally different from Japan's. In order to promote the Open Door Policy that they advocate, they must have a strong navy in the Pacific to suppress Japan. Starting from this point, aiding Chiang Kai-shek was naturally carried out in the same spirit as aiding Britain. While arguing that it was for self-defense, Japan and China were fighting each other and shedding blood. Britain used a strategy of pitting the enemy against themselves, so that France would fight against France, allowing itself to act freely in Europe and control the colonies, but the United States was even more cunning, using Britain and Chongqing, and even pulling in the Soviet Union, to cause them to shed blood on the continent, and then creating problems in Central and South America and Canada to bring them to heel. The opportunity to invade the golden world had arrived, and the United States wanted to openly take advantage of the fire. (Xiang: Review of the Yomiuri Hochi from November 19 to 21)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Oil and Grain Special Committee Actively Collects Raw Materials, Oil Mills in Various Regions Have Now Resumed Operations <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai edible oil collection and transportation matters are fully handled by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the committee is making unremitting efforts to carry out the collection and transportation work. According to the established oil and grain collection plan, in addition to ordering a large amount of edible oil from North China to be transported to Shanghai, it is also actively buying raw materials for oil extraction. It is learned that the committee has collected a large number of raw materials from various production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of edible oil supply in Shanghai in the future. The scope of raw materials for oil extraction is very wide, including three categories: (1) beans, including soybeans, beans, etc.; (2) miscellaneous grains, including sorghum, peanuts, gun seeds, rapeseed, etc.; and (3) various bones. The funds for collecting raw materials are provided by Chinese and Japanese banks in equal shares. If it is still insufficient, the Central Reserve Bank will supplement it. It is also learned that the raw materials collected by the committee are partly allocated to oil mills locally, and partly transported to Shanghai and allocated to Chinese and Japanese oil mills. After the factories in Shanghai were allocated raw materials, they have been very busy with oil extraction work in recent days. The oil mills in various regions have been forced to suspend operations due to a shortage of raw materials, but now they have all resumed operations. The committee's purchasing areas in the three provinces include Nanjing, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Nantong, and other places, and more than a dozen branch offices have been established in various important cities and counties, and the committee has sent staff to preside over them, so that the purchasing work can be carried out smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Diary of Naval Battles off Bougainville <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Beginning with the Bougainville Island operation, the air and naval forces of both sides concentrated in the South Pacific region and engaged in an unprecedented large-scale battle. Since the enemy landed on Mono Island on the 27th, there have been three successive engagements: the naval battle off Bougainville Island, and the first and second air battles off Bougainville Island. These created a record of annihilation unparalleled in the history of warfare. After these battles, the enemy seemed to be very afraid of the might of the Japanese air and naval forces. The following is a daily record of the period from November 5th onwards, up to the second air battle off Bougainville:</p>
<p>5th: From around 9:00 AM, Rabaul was subjected to two air raids, similar to the 4th. The enemy aircraft numbered about 150. Following the air raids, a reconnaissance operation on the same day discovered two enemy aircraft carriers with escorts in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Each was arranged in two groups, forming a circular formation and maintaining a high state of alert while navigating. Torpedo bomber squadrons, upon receiving attack orders, immediately departed. A successful surprise attack at dusk resulted in the torpedoing and sinking of two enemy aircraft carriers, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or destroyers. This marked the first naval battle off Bougainville Island, in which the enemy fleet was destroyed.</p>
<p>The enemy seemed to believe that the Japanese forces were determined to completely destroy the forces landing on Bougainville Island, and had concentrated a strong air and naval force in the area of 〇〇. The appearance of the enemy aircraft carrier group near the front line north of Guadalcanal Island in the central Solomon Islands is sufficient to 足 demonstrate the enemy's level of preparedness and the large scale of their naval forces. After the failure of the first naval battle off Bougainville Island, the enemy panicked greatly, and attempted to reinforce the Bougainville Island garrison by dispatching a fleet of warships and transport ships. The reconnaissance planes, although struggling with the weather, finally encountered a portion of the enemy warships north of Mono Island on the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, they discovered a portion of the enemy convoy off Cape Torokina, and in the afternoon, they learned of the whereabouts of the enemy's large convoy south of Torokina, including a main force of three battleships leading cruisers, destroyers, and other vessels, heading towards Cape Torokina. Subsequently, a large follow-up force centered on battleships was also discovered. Upon receiving the reports, a large formation of Japanese fighter-bombers conducted a daylight raid, departing to attack the enemy convoy, thus beginning the second air battle off Bougainville Island. Japanese fighter squadrons engaged about sixty to seventy enemy aircraft in the skies above the anchorage, shooting down fifteen. At the same time, Japanese dive bomber squadrons sank three destroyers and four transport ships, and set two cruisers and one transport ship on fire. This constituted a great victory achieved through a difficult daylight raid.</p>
<p>Following this attack, the enemy convoy fled in disarray, and the follow-up convoy and battleship force, which were advancing northward, turned back midway, using the rain showers at the time to cover their retreat. However, the Japanese torpedo bomber squadrons relentlessly pursued them, finally catching up at dusk and launching a fierce attack. The detailed account of this battle has already been reported, so it will be omitted here. In short, the devastating power of the proud Japanese naval air force's 　 torpedo attacks was fully demonstrated in this battle, sinking four battleships in one fell swoop early that morning.</p>
<p>On the battlefield where the great air battle had unfolded, the remains of sunken large ships such as battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were still fresh, and the sea surface was covered with black heavy oil, indicating the fierce battle of the previous night and the Japanese victory. Not a single ship could be seen nearby. Further south, in the sea south of Vella Lavella Island, remnants of the convoy could be seen, with cruisers, destroyers, and other vessels fleeing towards 食島.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Intentions</p>
<p>Having suffered heavy losses in the first and second naval battles off Bougainville, the enemy still seemed determined to deploy aircraft carriers and battleships in an attempt to secure air and sea supremacy and to bolster the supply to Bougainville Island. The enemy is throwing the full might of its air force into the decisive battle in the South Pacific. The Japanese forces, of course, cannot afford to be complacent merely because of the victories in the naval battle and two air battles off Bougainville. They must realize that the enemy will continue to send successive fleets and mobile forces. From the overall strategic perspective, it is natural to expect the enemy to exert all their strength in the battle for Bougainville Island. To counter this, Japan must continue to send strong air forces to the front lines, so that each sortie results in the destruction of enemy forces. The battle for Bougainville Island is truly a matter of "a long time to come," and the decisive battles in the South Pacific will become even more intense in the future.

<h3 id="e35">Breaking Through the Dark Natural Barrier: A True Account of the Bloody Battles in the South Pacific <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Approaching the Enemy</p>
<p>The unit approached the front line without a single gunshot being fired. The only sound echoing through the mountains was that of aircraft being serviced. As soon as they came out of the ridgeline, the enemy began firing with automatic rifles. The distance from the enemy was only five meters. "Tat-tat-tat," the flowing muzzles roared before their eyes. This was the most effective automatic rifle fire in the dense jungle. In the darkness, the pale faces of the Australian soldiers lined up like white melons in Tanaka's fields. "Kill!" With a shout, they jumped forward, hand grenades flew, and automatic rifles roared. "Damn it!" The soldiers frantically stabbed with their bayonets. A hand grenade was thrown at the base of a large tree, and the enemy soldier's limbs flew into the air. This hand-to-hand combat was truly satisfying! And the results were considerable. Before dawn, this plateau was ours. The planes had already fled overnight. The bright red morning sun rose in the sky.</p>
<p>"One, a soldier should value valor..."</p>
<p>The majestic voices of the soldiers reciting the Military Code echoed through the mountains, as if pursuing the defeated enemy.</p>
<p>The battlefield was as cool as autumn. The gentle morning breeze brushed against the battle-stained uniforms, refreshing the soul. Many enemy corpses, stabbed last night, were left on the battlefield. Presumably, they had desperately carried back as many as they could during their retreat.</p>
<p>"From this, it seems that the enemy's unity is also quite strong!" Lieutenant Nakamura said, inspecting the remains of the fierce battle.</p>
<p>The few remaining enemy corpses were all young. They wore short-sleeved shirts, shorts, long socks, and wide-brimmed hats, fastened under their chins with thin straps. Under the roots of the large tree where the hand grenades had been thrown last night, there was a trench about a foot deep. Two boxes of twenty-round hand grenades were scattered, broken and discarded. The areas near the tree roots were devastated by the hand grenade explosions.</p>
<p>"We threw them haphazardly in the dark, I didn't expect it to turn out like this!" The soldiers themselves couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p>
<p>"Sergeant, what about the 'Camel' cans?"</p>
<p>"Good stuff! Bring them here."</p>
<p>A private brought two or three cans of "Camel" meat.</p>
<p>"They're lighter than canned corned beef!"</p>
<p>"This kid, isn't this cigarettes? Don't you know?"</p>
<p>The private didn't smoke. As soon as he saw the 　 head, he thought they were all 愈.</p>
<p>As for Camel cigarettes, these were gifts received since 〇〇. The sergeant sent them unopened to a certain captain.</p>
<p>"'Camel' cans."</p>
<p>"Think of a witty remark!" The captain laughed. He distributed one cigarette to each of his men. Among the scattered enemy belongings were shirts, shorts, half-filled meat cans, corned beef, dry bread, 火願, cheese, razors, 云花 ointment, 子, cosmetics, and many photographs of women in each 昔.</p>
<p>That night, the enemy launched four counterattacks, attempting to retake the position, but they were all defeated by our fierce fire. The few survivors had no choice but to retreat towards Isurava.</p>
<p>Ascending the Kokoda high ground, a kilometer-wide grassland stretched out, with dense jungle extending in the distance. Looking south, the Owen Stanley Range stood coldly in the clouds. Peaks such as Mount Bellamy, Mount Bubi, Mount Nisbet, and Mount Alexander, ranging from 3,800 to 4,000 meters high, lined up like a folding screen. The black cliffs, with ancient trees that even beasts could not inhabit, the deep valleys filled with thick layers of fallen leaves and withered branches, reeked with a nauseating odor, like encountering 　 gas. "It looks a bit like the Japanese Alps covered in jungle!" the soldiers expressed their impressions. However, this description still fell short. Although New Guinea is said to be the last dark area left in the world, the Japanese army is now质地的 opening its doors. In the dense jungle where even the scorching sun could not dry the ground, the Japanese army opened roads, advancing by clearing mountains and valleys. The long lines of troops, carrying cannons, bullets, and food on their shoulders, snaked through the dense jungle. When climbing steep cliffs, the iron nails on their army boots struck the rocks, emitting dazzling sparks. Step by step, foot by foot, the marching troops drew lines on the dark map. Following these footprints were the groups of 高砂义勇队 who 組 provided supplies with blood and sweat on their backs.</p>
<p>Flanking Battles</p>
<p>〇臼 occupied Mount Bellamy and continued to attack the enemy position at Isurava. The 〇〇 unit, emerging from 　 at 　, immediately joined the flanking battle. In this battle, the enemy initially bombarded fiercely with mortars. The 関 machine gun fire of both sides swirled around like a whirlwind. Whirr, crash, crackle, the dense jungle exploded, and tree branches and soil 　 flew 　 into the air. Fire crows soared high, and Han smoke rose straight up, the dense jungle burned. Although we repeatedly charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the enemy position remained unmoved. This was because if this line were breached, they would have nowhere else to 　 retreat. Before them was a fire pit, behind them a cauldron of boiling oil; there was no way out of hell! The enemy must have been holding onto this mentality. So, as long as they had ammunition left, they continued their stubborn resistance. Dawn broke. The dense jungle that had shielded the positions of both sides had been stripped bare, revealing the broken trunks. Cannon smoke swirled like rising mist. Enemy soldiers appeared and disappeared in the trenches, their white faces twisted with terror. The storm of bullets continued to rake the ground. Day passed. Night turned to day. After fighting to the death day and night, a corner of the enemy's fortified position finally began to collapse. The 〇 team blocked their retreat, and we charged up in one go. From around 白尽 before and after, the enemy soldiers, caught in a pincer movement, were stabbed one after another, emitting their final cries as they fell from the cliffs. The bottomless valley opened its mouth wide and swallowed them. Next, when we stormed into the enemy position at Isurava from the high ground, the enemy soldiers were having lunch. They didn't have time to grab their weapons and fled helter-skelter, covering their heads.</p>
<p>Raising the Flag on the Summit</p>
<p>After a arduous battle of 〇 days, the Japanese flag was finally raised on this vital peak. Precious blood flowed, shimmering with purple light in the morning sun. Countless fragments of maps floated in the ruins of the enemy position.</p>
<p>This happened at night during the advance on 挨奧里比華: The unit was preparing to camp for the night in the mountains. From the forest opposite, two tall figures approached. A certain captain suspected that they were enemy soldiers and planned to capture them alive if they were indeed stragglers. They gradually approached.</p>
<p>"Hello?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Hello," the other side replied.</p>
<p>"Where did the 68th Battalion go?" they asked.</p>
<p>"To heaven."</p>
<p>"Heaven?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" The teaching soldier clearly saw the captain's face, was greatly shocked, and hurriedly raised his automatic rifle, but the captain's treasured sword had already struck. "Bury the two 　." The corpses were buried. At daybreak, a small branch was stuck in the mound, with a piece of paper on it that read: "Grave of enemy 　 soldiers."</p>
<p>At the time of the occupation of 挨奧里比華, because the supply line was long and transportation was difficult, the rice they carried was almost exhausted. The captain and everyone else chewed on grass roots and ate the buds of 樂 　 trees every day, and fought against hunger and lack of struggle.</p>
<p>In the battles up to this point, although strategic bases were established in the rear, the soldiers were sincerely grateful for the desperate efforts of the 高砂义勇队 during the many battles across this great mountain range. Although they starved as much as the soldiers, they tried their best to save their own food, transporting rice, one grain at a time, to the front lines. The 高砂义勇队 members, grateful for the glory of being Japanese subjects, dedicated themselves to the supply battle. After transporting ammunition and provisions to the front lines, they cooked rice in the midst of gunfire and served food to the wounded soldiers. They also fetched water from a valley two and a half 里 (about ten 余 里) away and filled the soldiers' water bottles. On the return trip, they also transported the wounded soldiers back to the rear. Their hardship was no less than that of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The 高砂义勇队, who are currently engaged in supplying and caring for the troops on the New Guinea front and at the South Pacific bases, shedding blood and sweat day and night, deserve our utmost gratitude.

<p>— Chen Ming</p>
<p>Setting: Adapted from Yu Ruowen's short story "A Tragedy of Life" in Bai Mao, Issue 20. Location: Shanghai. Time: 1943. Characters: A Ming — A craftsman in his thirties. Wife — A woman of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a slightly haggard face. Child — A baby who was abandoned from its mother's arms after being born for only a month. The Eastern Housewife! Voluble, fierce and evil, only concerned with her own comfort, lacking any human compassion.</p>
<p>The curtain rises on a stage that reflects the time of about 7 p.m. It is just as the sun has set below the horizon, and the twilight is becoming increasingly intense. A Ming, holding his child, is pacing back and forth at the entrance of an alley, as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>A Ming (hereafter referred to as Ming) (The child emits a hoarse cry; he seems anxious and cannot bear it) Child, don't cry, your mother will be here soon to 　give you milk. Don't cry, just stay quiet for a while. (The crying diminishes a little) Be a good boy, and when Papa has money, he'll ask your Mama to stay with you every day and stop helping other people. When you grow up, Papa will buy you a schoolbag and send you to school, and you'll study hard and become a useful person, not like your Papa, who's illiterate and can only be someone else's苦銄 craftsman, and can't even feed his family. (But the child's hoarse cry becomes even more forceful) Ah! Child! (Just then, Little A Ming's mother hurries in)</p>
<p>Wife Child! What's wrong? (She instinctively takes the child from A Ming's arms and holds it close, preparing to breastfeed) The child cries every day. Look, he's become 　 so thin, like a stake. 　What can Mama give him to eat? Ah, 媽糕 is so expensive again; poor child!</p>
<p>Ming The water porridge has been given, but he hasn't wanted to eat much of it these past few days.</p>
<p>Wife (Seeing that the child won't suckle, she doesn't 　go down but feels even more though it seems 　over) Doesn't want to eat much? (Tears are already flowing down) A Ming, I think the child is not well. He should be taken to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Ming The child is a little sick. I already took him to the doctor's a few days ago.</p>
<p>Wife What did the doctor say?</p>
<p>Ming The doctor said that for such a small child, plus insufficient milk and poor nutrition, — that's very troublesome.</p>
<p>Wife Gaa! (She cries loudly and hugs the child tightly)</p>
<p>Ming So, today I wanted to ask you about going back home, because it doesn't make much sense to help others here.</p>
<p>Wife How will we survive if we go back?</p>
<p>Ming It's hard whether we go back or not, and besides, the child's illness requires attention, so let's go back and think of another way! Wife I don't have a way to see what 　for now, I still have to stay here, slowly accumulating some money to buy some milk cake for the child, find a doctor to see a good 　 sickness! The child can't 　 take care of the 　 for some more 　 to help us answer that!</p>
<p>Wife I don't have a way for now, I still have to stay here, slowly 　 accumulating some money to buy some milk cake for the child, vote on some 　 doctors to see a good 　 sickness! The child can't 　 take care of the 　 for some more 　 to help us answer that.</p>
<p>Ming Well, you've been here for more than two weeks. How has the lady of the house treated you? Does she know about you stealing milk for the child? Wife Ah, working for others means suffering losses, and I can only swallow my anger. Especially the mistress here, she's so difficult to deal with. Always calling you to do this and that, never letting you rest. Apart from 　taking care of the child, she wants you to do all kinds of chores: emptying the chamber pot, washing cloths, washing clothes, going to the market to buy groceries, coming home to cook. I'm exhausted every day, and can only catch a breath when I've put the child and the mistress to sleep. If she finds some small mistake, the mistress's face is like a man-eating beast, her eyes glare at you, scolding you and gesticulating. Sometimes, I really can't bear it. (She pauses, in pain) When I see other people's children eating milk in my arms, my heart feels like it's breaking. I think about why my own child can't even get his mother's milk, and is getting thinner and thinner, sicker and sicker. Is it our destiny as poor people to suffer so much?......</p>
<p>Ming Xiaoming's mother, I really feel sorry for you. I've never given you and our child a good life. I'm a husband who can't support his child and wife. When I think about this, I feel like a fire is burning in my heart, like I want to fight something, to let off steam. But when I see you and the child...</p>
<p>Wife What do you think about?</p>
<p>Ming Never mind. I advise you to go back home.</p>
<p>Wife Let's talk about going back in a couple of days. It's getting late now. It's a bit inconvenient if it gets too late, and besides, autumn is 凉 cool in the morning and evening; the child can't 　 stand the 凉 cool. You should take him back early. (She hands the child to A Ming, and touches the money in her pocket) This is a little reward money that I've saved up. Take it and take the child to the doctor first, and then use the remaining money to buy some milk cake 　 for him to eat.</p>
<p>Ming (He wants to say something, but seems unable to, and eventually prepares to leave with the child.)</p>
<p>Wife (Just as A Ming takes a few steps, she runs over to look at her child again. At that moment, the Eastern Housewife rushes out. She sees her and cries out in alarm) Ah!</p>
<p>Eastern Housewife (hereafter referred to as Wife) Good for you, you have such a big courage, came to the outside 　your own children, I can give you free access to go in and out of the 　and it is to look up to you, I want to believe in you, I can not imagine you that kind of cruel heart.</p>
<p>Wife Madam!</p>
<p>Wife Hmph! No wonder my child has been crying these past few days. So you want to starve him to death and use the milk you save to fatten your own child. Fine!

<p>— Chunxin</p>
<p>Daylight vanishes with the passing of the sun, and night takes its place across the earth. Those busy, wriggling people driven by life mostly quiet down at the arrival of night, letting out the stuffy air accumulated during the day and relieved of the burdens of life, breathing easily under the heavy exhaustion, and spending the night at ease.</p>
<p>Night, what a leisurely and moving rhythm. Although I curse all darkness, I love this still night surrounded by darkness. Here, there is no sight of haste, no sight of people wearing masks and acting. All that can be seen is an endless expanse of darkness, but there are stars and a moon in the sky. People are asleep. The only feeling the night gives me is an indescribable tenderness, a still atmosphere that compels me not to leave it, like an infant nestled in the arms of a loving mother.</p>
<p>During the day, I toil and bustle for life. The time when I can rest at night is the freest and most unfettered moment for me. I silently ponder in this darkness the trivial matters for which I have no time to think. In reality, the darkness's attack is not fearful to me. The stars are smiling at me, and the moonlight is occasionally swaying. This is enough to encourage me to fight hard against the darkness and struggle against the exhaustion. Moreover, there is also the even more lovely tomorrow—with new hope. Only those who have strongly encouraged themselves in the darkness and wrestled it, will urgently need tomorrow's 　 work.</p>
<p>In the still night, asking myself sincerely, during the day, while traveling among companions who are scheming against each other for worldly gain, has it made you lose the courage to advance? Has it added a little darkness to your heart, which was born pure and clear? Will the rough and tragic life make you surrender? People who silently ponder in the darkness—night is ultimately what you love, and light is ultimately what you pursue. After you have weathered your moment of still reflection, throw the things that disturb your heart out of your mind, cast them into the boundless sky, and lie down with a smile to greet tomorrow!</p>

<p>&gt;Sports [P Football Group Situation Confused Donghua Team Exclusively Occupies the Top Spot One Police Team Suffers Miserable Defeat Yesterday Against the Portuguese Dark Horse, Resulting in an Unexpected Victory Over the Overseas Chinese Team</p>
<p>The football league's Group A had important matches the day before yesterday and yesterday. On Saturday, the two major Chinese teams, Donghua and Lianyi, met, and Donghua won 1-0. Yesterday at Yiyuan, the Portuguese team won 1-0, a satisfying result. In the afternoon, the Jewish team surprisingly defeated the Overseas Chinese team 3-1, which can be considered an upset. Although the situation in Group A is chaotic, Donghua is exclusively occupying the top spot and has become the dominant force. The following is a record of the events and an assessment of the strategies employed.</p>
<p>Donghua Wins Over Lianyi</p>
<p>This battle was not only about the future of the championship but also a battle for the new leader of the Chinese teams. Due to the reputation of both teams, from noon until 6 PM on Jiaozhou Road, fans were coming and going. At 1:30 PM, the gate was closed tightly, and even those who had pre-purchased tickets could not enter. The crowd was densely packed, forcing them to break the gate and surge in. As a result, fences and stands collapsed, and there was no room for order inside the stadium. People climbed everywhere, chairs fell over, fences collapsed, and the crowd was in an uproar. The fans' excitement was unprecedented and beyond expectation. The match began at 4 PM. Donghua, taking advantage of its strong offense, immediately launched a total attack, advancing from the right and attacking from the left, creating a powerful momentum. However, Lianyi's defense was solid. Liu Xianhan kept the goal intact. Lianyi also launched counterattacks from time to time, but because the forwards lacked practice, they were not in sync, resulting in a stalemate. Neither side scored in the first half. The situation remained the same after the start of the second half. The atmosphere in the stadium remained tense. However, both sides managed to maintain their previous status.</p>
<p>At 25 minutes into the second half, Zhang Lin'gen got the ball and passed it to Wang Xisheng. You Liang gestured in the crowd, and Xiao Wang passed accurately. You Liang swayed at the top, with the iron hoof in an excellent position. Liu Lang was defeated—this crucial goal sealed the victory! Donghua, the darling of the heavens, did not disappoint the crowd!</p>
<p>Analyzing the game, the players on both sides were too nervous, resulting in a lack of brilliant moments. Lianyi focused on defense, with Song Lingsheng employing a third defensive line; while defense was solid, the attack was inevitably disorganized. Donghua's offensive was frequent, but due to being trapped, there were few excellent plays. Song employed a man-to-man strategy, extremely tight. Zheng Fuzhen deserves the most credit, covering all aspects, and Sun Jinshun's goal should also be considered a major contribution. Li Ning's experience and You Liang's bravery were undeniable facts, and although Bang Lun lacked performance opportunities, he was exceptionally calm. I say, the young man can enter the hall of fame. Looking back at Lianyi, Wu Qi and Song Lingsheng raced to save the situation, and their efforts were not small. However, Tian Sheng seemed to have limited strength, and A Kui frequently missed opportunities. Yi Chen had been away from the field for a long time and made significant oversights. The 1-0 defeat the other day was, in my opinion, just as I expected.</p>
<p>If Donghua can defeat the police team, capture the Portuguese team, and celebrate the victory, it is worth waiting for. Encourage each other!</p>
<p>Portuguese Team Defeats One Police Team</p>
<p>One police team won against the Overseas Chinese team 5-1, and the Overseas Chinese team won against the Portuguese team 5-3. Logically, one would think that the police team would have the upper hand, but the Portuguese team's performance was unexpected. They easily defeated the police team 2-0. In the first half, the veteran, Xiao Ti, broke through and scored. In the second half, the newcomer, Bo Lada, also scored, both goals being clear and beautiful. The Portuguese team's defense was excellent. Mai Di, like a magnet, was difficult to overcome. Roberts Stoff was trapped and unable to use his skills, which led to the result. The Portuguese team's offense and defense were well-organized, and they seemed capable of challenging Donghua. However, the Portuguese team does not always live up to expectations and sometimes performs abnormally. Whether they can deliver a crucial blow depends on their usual performance.</p>
<p>Dark Horse Defeats Overseas Chinese Team</p>
<p>When the Jewish team and the Overseas Chinese team met, everyone thought the Overseas Chinese team would win without hesitation. It is truly unpredictable, and upsets happen in matches. The Jewish team, with its old, weak, and depleted forces, used its remaining strength. Wen Tu scored three goals while sick, and the Overseas Chinese team missed a penalty kick. With a score of 3-1, the Jewish team won for the first time.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese team's defeat was due to its incomplete lineup and poor adjustments. The central defense line could not advance or defend effectively. The forwards, Fa Fan and his old partner, Shi Qinglu, were unable to move effectively due to his light movements. How could they score? The Jewish team's advantage was that they became braver as they fought, never losing courage. This is why they can maintain their "dark horse" spirit.</p>
<p>Thoughts After Watching the Match</p>
<p>Currently, the situation in Group A is that each team has a chance, but Donghua exclusively occupies the top spot! We sincerely wish them a smooth journey in the future!</p>
<p>It is also heard that Lianyi will protest because many people entered the venue in the last ten minutes, which was against the rules. How will the authorities handle this? As a reporter, I have to say that victory and defeat are common in military affairs. Moreover, the fans' entry into the venue was not excessively disruptive. If they meet again in the future, they can win back a goal. Encourage them! Encourage them! (Mei Jie)</p>
<p>Renyu Wins Over Huaying (51-45) Huaying's main player, Shu Shi, was absent, and the lineup was incomplete. However, losing by only three points is enough to be proud of. Renyu has many well-known players in the sports world, while Huaying is still a new team. With this result, Qian Junxu Cang's guidance has made a significant contribution!</p>
<p>Dongfang Easily Takes Yiyu (51-34) Both teams belong to the same category. Why must they be so eager to fight each other? The match was polite and normal, just as expected. The older brother easily defeated the younger brother.</p>
<p>Juren Breaks Huaying (48-25) Originally, the match was scheduled for Hualian, but Hualian requested a change of date. As a result, Huaying was forced to play two matches. Although they were tired, their spirit was commendable. However, a tired army facing an ambitious home team will naturally be at a disadvantage and submit to a subordinate position. (Must Win)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Jianqing Cup Basketball Tournament Concludes Longhua Wins Overall Championship <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Jianqing Cup Youth Basketball Tournament, co-organized by the Chinese Youth Association and the Jianqing Group, started at the beginning of last month and has now concluded. Longhua won the overall championship. The tournament was not only intense but also emphasized sportsmanship and morality. Therefore, there were no absences, forfeits, or unpleasant incidents, which is commendable. Promoting basketball should start in this way, so we are happy to acknowledge it and record the full results: A total of fifteen teams participated, divided into three groups: Jian, Qing, and . The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>In the final, Longhua narrowly defeated Bai by 17-16. In another match, Qingyan narrowly defeated by 14-11. In the match against Qing, the time ended with a score of 11-11. In overtime, Longhua fortunately won by three points with a free throw, winning the overall championship.</p>
<p>Attached is the list of Longhua team members: Chen Zhengsen, Lin Junqian, Shu Jia, Wang Ji, Chen Guo, Li Jinggen, Ye Yunshan, Jia, Long, Wang Liyan. The director of the association, Liang Zhaoan, reported that the referees hired for the tournament were all volunteers and arrived on time, providing fair service, which is admirable. He also expressed his gratitude on behalf of the association! (Reporter)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Xiqing Group A Basketball Second Week Juren Splits Two Barriers Huaying's Spirit is Excellent <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Although there were no special confrontations in the second week of the Xiqing Basketball Tournament, each game was intense, indicating that the strength of each team was balanced, and the situation was not too disparate. Interest has therefore increased, and it is no wonder that on the evenings of the Group A matches, there were always many attendees. The battle situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Amateur Defeats Dahua (34-32) Although the amateur team was slightly affected by Jia Youliang's absence, they were careful and worked hard, eventually defeating the strong enemy by one point. Dahua's biggest problem is that they are too hot-tempered. The reporter mentioned this before, but the team still failed to correct their mistakes, resulting in many missed free throws. Failure was inevitable!</p>
<p>Juren Defeats Shantou Team (44-25) This was expected. However, the Shantou team, with the momentum of defeating Renyu, was quite promising. Their offense relied on long-range shots, which were risky. However, Juren's defense was tight, with deep trenches and high barriers, making it difficult to cross the thunder pool, so they had no choice. Their defense adopted a zone defense tactic. When the enemy's ball was released, they tried to maneuver to avoid being intercepted. They were meticulous, posing a considerable threat to Juren. Unfortunately, their endurance was insufficient, and they collapsed. Most of their points were lost in the last seven minutes. It can be imagined that the players of the An team are young and energetic. If they can encourage themselves and have no distractions, it will not be difficult to go further. They can become a strong team. A message to the Shantou team: encourage each other!</p>
<p>Huayu Defeats Tongren (42-27) Both teams were known for their teamwork. Tongren recently got the help of the famous football player Zhang Banglun, adding beauty to perfection and strengthening their momentum. However, their physiques were relatively short, and they lacked practice due to work commitments, which was inevitably neglected. It was almost impossible for them to defeat the rising Huayu team.</p>
<h3 id="e42">What I Saw at the Xiqing Basketball Venue <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The official withdrawal of Zhongbei from Xiqing has inevitably reduced interest, and Juren has lost a strong opponent. Will our full enthusiasm for Xiqing basketball now be entirely focused on Dongfang? ▽ The audience's boos were very loud in every game, especially in the game between Juren and Shantou team. Although the referees tried their best to explain, they were overwhelmed by the noise. Although some spectators may have misunderstood, the intensity of the boos was due to the referees' slow decisions. The rules published in this magazine can be used as a motto by the fans!</p>
<p>There are many spectators at Huaying's games, as fans and movie fans gather in one room, creating a grand scene!</p>
<p>The famous women's volleyball player, Miss Zhu Shifang, has not been seen on the court for a long time, but she has appeared in Xiqing!</p>
<p>The Yiqin Baolian team seems to have immature skills, but according to the team's coach, Jin Bo, the team will win with spirit. Although they know they may not escape the bottom spot, they will strive to improve. This spirit is worth mentioning. (De)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Differences Between International and Xiqing Basketball Rules Players and Spectators in the Xiqing League Should Pay Attention <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Hesheng</p>
<p>The All-Shanghai Basketball Tournament organized by the Xiqiao Youth Association this year has 54 participating teams composed of Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, French, Filipino, Russian, and Jewish players. This is the largest basketball league in Shanghai since the "incident." Chinese teams account for more than two-thirds of the participants. Due to environmental constraints, the rules used in previous Xiqing basketball tournaments have often differed from those commonly used by Chinese teams. This year, Xiqing will continue to use the 1941 American rules (which have been adopted by Japanese, North Chinese, and Japanese residents in Shanghai). However, the rules used by Chinese players in Shanghai are the 1936 international rules. Therefore, Chinese players may suffer losses due to unfamiliarity with the rules or have misunderstandings with the referees. At the beginning of the league, the differences between the international and Xiqing rules are outlined below to inform Chinese players and spectators.</p>
<p>(1) Backboard</p>
<p>International: 1.20 meters high, 1.80 meters wide, rectangular or fan-shaped, made of glass, steel, or hardwood (Chapter 2, Article 1)</p>
<p>(2) Center Jump</p>
<p>International: The center player must not tap the ball before it reaches its highest point, must not leave the center circle before the ball is tapped out, and must tap the ball no more than twice. After the ball is tapped out, the center player must not touch the ball again until it has been touched by another player or has touched the ground or the backboard. According to the above, the ball can be tapped a total of four times during the jump ball, meaning each center player can tap it twice. Other players should stand within the court in any location that does not interfere with the movement of the jumping players and the referee (no restriction on the 6.5-foot radius outer circle) (Chapter 6, Article 6)</p>
<p>Xiqing: The first half of the article is the same as the international rules, but the second half states that when jumping for the ball in the center circle or on the free throw line, except for the two jumping players, other players are not allowed to enter the circle with a 6.5-foot radius before the ball is tapped out. Violators will have the ball thrown inbounds by the opposing team from outside the nearest sideline (Chapter 8, Article 6)</p>
<p>(3) Division Line</p>
<p>International: If a player passes the ball from their own backcourt to a teammate standing on the division line, it will be considered a pass over the division line. If that player receives the ball and then passes it to another teammate standing on the division line, the ball will be considered a pass back to the backcourt. That is, the division line can be considered the frontcourt or the backcourt, depending on the position of the pass (Chapter 6, Article 8, Note)</p>
<p>Xiqing: The division line belongs to the backcourt. If a player dribbles the ball from the backcourt to the division line and passes the ball to a teammate standing on the division line, it will not be considered a pass back to the backcourt because both players are in the backcourt (the division line is the backcourt) and have not retreated from the frontcourt. However, in this case, the 10-second time limit will continue to be counted (Chapter 8, Article 8, Note)</p>
<p>(4) Resuming Play After a Goal, Free Throw, or Last Free Throw is Made</p>
<p>International: After a goal or free throw is made, the referee should announce the number of points and the number of the scoring player to the scorekeeper. Then, the referee should hold the ball and hand it over to the player of the losing team. The player should wait for the referee to signal to resume play with the whistle and then resume play by throwing the ball inbounds from any location behind the backcourt end line (Chapter 6, Article 9)</p>
<p>Xiqing: After a goal is made, the player of the losing team stands in any location on the backcourt end line and throws the ball inbounds within five seconds, without the need for the referee's whistle or "ball" (Chapter 8, Article 9)</p>
<p>(5) Time-Out Period in the Final Stage (Intermediate School Rules Briefly)</p>
<p>International: If the total scores of the two teams are equal at the end of the second half, an overtime period should be added. Each overtime period is five minutes. If the score is still tied at the end of the first period, another period should be added. This continues until one team is ahead at the end of a period. There should be a one-minute break at the end of each period. The overtime period is extra time from the start, but the start of each period should be a jump ball in the center circle, and the teams should switch baskets (Chapter 10, Article 3)</p>
<p>Xiqing: If the total scores of the two teams are equal at the end of the second half, an overtime period should be added, and the teams should not switch baskets. Each overtime period is five minutes. If the score is still tied at the end of the first period, another period should be added. This continues until one team is ahead at the end of a period. There should be a two-minute break before each overtime period. The start of each period should be a jump ball in the center circle, and the teams should not switch baskets (Chapter 9, Article 3)</p>
<p>(6) Time-Outs</p>
<p>International: Each team can request a time-out three times during the entire game (only the captain can request). However, in the event of injury or other accidents, staff members can still make extra requests for time-outs. However, each additional request will be considered a technical foul (Chapter 9, Article 2)</p>
<p>Xiqing: Each team can request a time-out five times during the entire game (not limited to the captain). Extra requests for time-outs beyond the allowed number of times will be considered a technical foul (Chapter 11, Article 4)</p>
<p>(7) Three-Second Rule</p>
<p>International: There is no three-second rule during the game.</p>
<p>Xiqing: The player with the ball cannot wait for more than three seconds in any part of the free throw area under the basket. In the area between the free throw line and the middle of the end line, even if a teammate does not have the ball, they cannot wait for more than three seconds while the ball is under the control of a teammate (Chapter 14, Article 12)</p>
<p>(8) Fouls and Penalties During Free Throws</p>
<p>International: If the ball touches the basket or backboard before the ball touches the free throw line or is delayed for more than ten seconds during a free throw (Chapter 12, Article 2)</p>
<p>Ruling: The free throw is invalid. If it is a free throw with one attempt, the ball should be jumped in the center circle regardless of whether it is made or not. If the violation occurs during the last free throw of multiple attempts, the ball should also be jumped in the center circle regardless of whether it is made or not.</p>
<p>Xiqing: If the ball touches the basket or backboard before the ball touches the free throw line or is delayed for more than ten seconds during a free throw (Chapter 14, Article 2)</p>
<p>Penalty: The free throw is invalid. Regardless of whether it is made or not, a player from the opposing team will throw the ball inbounds from behind the end line. This kind of throw-in should only be used in the last free throw. If it is a free throw for a technical foul, the ball should be thrown inbounds from the center line.</p>
<p>(9) Technical Fouls by Substitute Players</p>
<p>International: A substitute player exchanges words with other players before the game continues (except for words passed by the referee).</p>
<p>Penalty: One free throw is awarded, and a technical foul is recorded against the team captain.</p>
<p>Xiqing: Players can exchange words at any time without restriction.</p>
<p>International: When the game is a dead ball, the substitute player can immediately enter the court and notify the referee after the scorekeeper blows the whistle.</p>
<p>Xiqing: When the game is a dead ball, the substitute player can only enter the court and substitute after the scorekeeper blows the whistle and the referee approves it; otherwise, it will be considered a technical foul, and substitution is not allowed when the team makes a goal, unless a time-out is requested (Chapter 5, Article 3) and (Chapter 15, Article 4)</p>
<p>(10) Request to Re-Establish Positions After a Substitute Player</p>
<p>International: No matter how many substitute players there are (limited to five substitute players), they can all ask the referee to have the opposing team re-establish positions.</p>
<p>Xiqing: Only when there are three or more substitute players entering the court at the same time in a team can they ask the referee to have the opposing team re-establish positions (Chapter 5, Article 3, Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>(11) Continuing Play After a Technical Foul Free Throw</p>
<p>International: Whether the last free throw for mutual fouls and technical foul free throws are made or not, the ball should be jumped in the center circle in all cases except for the following: If a team receives consecutive fouls, and at least one of them is a free throw for a personal foul, then the game should continue if the last free throw is missed.</p>
<p>Xiqing: Other aspects are the same as the international rules, but regardless of whether the technical foul free throw is made or not, the player of the free-throwing team will throw the ball inbounds from the center line to continue the game.</p>
<p>(12) Throwing Free Throws</p>
<p>International: All free throws must be thrown according to the rules.</p>
<p>Xiqing: For a single free throw or the last free throw of multiple attempts for a technical or personal foul, the captain of the free-throwing team can request to give up the free throw and instead throw the ball inbounds from the center line.</p>
<p>(13) Fouls During Throwing the Ball into the Basket</p>
<p>International: If the opposing party commits a personal foul while a player is throwing the ball into the basket, two free throws should be awarded if the ball fails to enter the basket as a result. If the ball still enters the basket and is valid, only one free throw should be awarded (Chapter 13, Article 13, Penalty 1)</p>
<p>Xiqing: If the opposing party commits a personal foul while a player is throwing the ball into the basket, two free throws should be awarded if the ball fails to enter the basket as a result. If the ball still enters the basket and is valid, only one free throw should be awarded. However, if the actions of the fouling party are rude and intentionally personal, two free throws can also be awarded even if the ball enters the basket.</p>
<p>(14) Technical Foul for "Touching the Ball"</p>
<p>International: After Team A throws the ball into the basket, the losing team, Team B, throws the ball inbounds after the referee holds the ball and blows the whistle.</p>
<p>Xiqing: If the ball is touched before Team B, the losing team, throws the ball inbounds after Team A throws the ball into the basket, it is considered a technical foul (because Team B can immediately throw the ball inbounds to attack without waiting for the referee to blow the whistle after losing a point.) (End)</p>

<p>Everyone wants their arms, legs, neck, chest, and shoulders to have a perfectly developed shape. As long as they have the will, they can achieve this goal, but those who have this will must also have this work.</p>
<p>If you can practice faithfully for fifteen minutes every day according to the following methods, nothing is impossible. You must know that fifteen minutes every day is far more beneficial than a casual hour. Scholars should remember this.</p>
