<h3>社評　江蘇省政與警政前途</h3>
<p>江蘇省在全國各省中，無論從地域，政治，經濟，教育，文化各方面以觀，莫不居於極重要地位。因此江蘇省之政治措施，在全國各省中實具有模範與領導的作用。我們深感於此，當上月初旬江蘇省人事　迭之時，即於九月十一日十二日兩度撰論，列舉過去省政得失之點，並作建議數事：　目前中央政治與地方政治，同樣有革新必要，地方政治革新，可自蘇省為始，假定以六個月為試驗時期，以推行於其他各省。　令後蘇省政治，絕對需要專家政治，而淘汰官僚政治，現代政治內容，自決定以至執行過程中，隨時隨地需要科學頭腦運用處理，重視時間，爭取效率，絕非官僚主義，顩預敷衍，所能應付。　從速開始地方自治工作，建立民意機構，提高人民參政意識，促成政府與人民打成一片。　廢除地方苛捐雜稅，減輕農民負担。</p>
<p>同時，特別强調中國政治，向來失敗於人事之牽制，雖有時或有革新主張，恒不能為適應事實之隨時調整。此次江蘇省政府之改組，不失為中央革新政治之最好機會。自　政人選，高級官吏以至各級公務人員，登用標準，絕對採取「唯才主義」，一反地域觀念與黨派觀念。對於考核標準，絕對注重操守廉潔。在目前中國尚未確立法治基礎，公務入員之才榦廉潔，依然是政治良好的最大因素。因此，對於用人問題，尤其值得慎重決定。</p>
<p>其次，民政中的驚務行政一項，極關重要。警察為公務人員中最接近民間者，驚政的良窳，最易使民間發生直接觀感，民間對於政治的信仰，從驚察的服務中最能收效。上月下旬內政部召開第二屆全國警政會議，我們深切感覺警政在戰時更為重要，也會撰論貢獻意見，特別主張提高警務人員正當待遇，使學識優長，有志服務之士，樂於投身警界，充實警政人事。當然，澄清警界的不良分子，淘汰官僚主義的腐化分子，尤爲積極和必要。</p>
<p>現在江蘇省長以及高級官吏，均已先後明令發表。省畏陳羣氏以內政部長轉任，足見中樞已能車視江蘇省政地位之重要，而陳氏在調任命令發表以後，尚以內政部長地位主持召開全國警政會議。因此，我們僅依常識判斷，今後江蘇省政中，至少對於驚政一項，是最可能有刷新面目的表現，以振奮人民對於政治的信仰。</p>
<p>然而，我們從日前政府發表的江蘇省高級官吏名單加以考察，難免有所感慨。我們絕無成見，僅從警務而言，其職責之重要，任務之艱巨，既如上述，則主持人選，無疑的必須具備豐富的驚政經驗，廉潔的操守歷史。即退而求其次，必也是警政專家，諳於行政者。如果引用絕無驚政學識，不知警政內容為何物者，而謂為起用人才於隴畝之間，識拔俊秀於草莽之中，簡直是聊自解嘲，視政事為兒戲，人民尚有理智，加以判別，況負責者如為一不學無術之輩，則難免引用同儕，羣趨若驚，其結果何如，不難推知。未知當局於提出人選或決定人選時，會念及和考慮江蘇警政以至整個江蘇省政的前途否？我們對於江蘇新省政的新人事，原寄以極大的期待，今就警務人事以觀，無疑巳給大衆以莫大失望。我們處於江蘇人民地位，中國人民地位；激於愛護江蘇當局熱情，愛護中央熱情，瞻念江蘇政治前途，瞻念中國政治前途，如果不澈底講求刷新人事，重視人才之道，則黯淡悽慘的環境，將無法突破。嗚呼！但願祀人憂天！豈願故作悲觀論耶！</p>
<h3>馬來籌設參事會　予住民參政機會　日駐軍當局頒布實施綱領</h3>
<p>昭南三日中央社電　關於馬來住民參政事宜，刻正由日軍政監部籌劃中。折已制定馬來住民參政實施要領，並於二日下午由常局頒布。該耍領在使馬來住民之下情上達，予以直接擔當正務之機會，並規定先設置　詢機關及錄用住民官吏，將於各市內設立參事會，作為諮詢機關，其委員需經各市長官銓選，並經軍政官認可。入數由各州長官規定，均為名譽職，參事會議長由各州市長官擔任，副議長由土人擔任，參事會於必要時招集，其討論之事項不受限制，以資民意之上達，又極力錄用當地官吏，凡住民優秀者均予以錄用，至於該要領所規定之具體措置，近將由各州市予以決定，由此馬來住民之參政近將付　實現。</p>
<h3>華北收買食糧　地方長官負責　王委員長發表談話</h3>
<p>北平三日中央社電　華北政委會委員長王克教氏三日於省巾長官會議席上，曾述及關於收買食糧事宜，茲誌其訓示各長官之要旨如次：當此實施收買雜糧之期，各省市長官應速事決定所管各縣區之應行供出量與收買完成期限，嚴格確保塲地雜糧，因此各省市長需分配各縣區之分担供出量，規定收買資金分配額，速為放出，以從事合宜之收買工作，而對於負靑收買機關之採運社及合作社，應由各縣區地方官嚴加監督與指導，俾致按其成續優劣，分別予以當罰。平時對收買工作人員及地方官吏保甲長有劣行者，亦應予以嚴懲。此外在此收買食糧之際，並應實行廉價配給，農民之生活必需品，但此須入於農民之手，絕對不容營私舞弊，俾使配給得宜。</p>
<h3>京滬記者團　昨午返京</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　京滬新聞界前應華北政委會之邀，扣織考察團北上考察，一行十九人由團長趙慕儒氏率領，於九月二十六日抵北平，在平除訪問中日各機關並遊覽故都名勝外，對於當地政治經濟文化教育情形，考察尤詳，華北政委會各機關及民間團體，以及日本當局招待極為熱烈，在平勾留五日，所獲甚豐。原定離平後赴津濟靑等地考察，關以北方各地防疫工作正厲，旅行甚爲不便，故臨時中止，全團除有五人滯平外，其他團員由趙團長領導，於十月二日上午搭車南返，三日午後五時許抵首都，首都新聞界多入均到浦口車站歡迎，趙國長並發表此行感想，預定四日上午赴宣傳部謁林部長報吿考察經過，周市長學昌並定日內設　為該團洗　。</p>
<h3>武漢日總領　移管之敵產</h3>
<p>漢口三日中央社電　武漢日總領事三十日移會之敵產，（十七）件，茲錄誌目錄於后：　漢口電燈公司，　九江利中洋行，　漢口怡和洋行，　天祥洋行，　恰和工廠，　其樂洋行，　漢口打包公司，　平和洋行，　和記洋行，　新泰磚瓦廠，　　和利冰廠，　　　林洋行，　　大東洋行，　　太平洋行，　　漢口俱樂部，　　博學中學，　　魏氏紀念堂。</p>
<h3>鄂省府注意　冬季民食</h3>
<p>漢口三日中央社電　鄂省政府爲展開冬季中心工作，曾通令省屬各廳處局，各自擬具冬季中心工作計劃，預定表彙呈省府交由政務廳審核，統籌辦理。現以冬季時期即將屆臨，對於民衆食米配給問題爲當前急務，現省府通令省糧食局經籌擬具食糧配給辦法，說明呈報，以利冬季民食。</p>
<h3>聶伯河中游　爭奪戰劇烈　南路德軍退出泰曼鎭</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德元首行營二日發表戰報稱：　蘇軍在柴普魯基東南數日來發動大攻勢但被擊退。月蒙電創，故一日僅作局部的小攻擊。　蘇軍在聶伯河中游區依然發動攻勢，企圖爭奪橋頭堡。</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德元首行　星期日中午發表公報稱：庫彭橋頭以及東綫之南部與中部，敵軍於星期六實行局部進攻。在若干據點發生激戰後，敵軍即被擊退，德軍破壤一切重要軍事設備後，即退出泰曼（Taman）鎭，當時敵軍並未覺察。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍消息靈通方面昨夜宣稱：蘇軍續在東綫巾路戈梅爾區，以壓力加諸德軍，氣候雖極惡劣，蘇軍仍出動大隊坦克車砲兵，飛機等作戰，命圖襲擊德軍後衛之側翼但終未獲逞。同時蘇軍以重壓加諸沿斯摩倫斯克公路之德軍陣地，數度進政，均被吾守軍擊退，敵軍在某點曾突入德軍陣地，但即予反攻擊退。德軍在公路迤北出擊，進展殊多，德空軍亦在斯摩倫斯克四南助戰，轟炸敵在斯摩倫斯克迤北狄密杜夫附近之臨時飛行塲，設備均予炸毀。東綫北路無大戰。</p>
<h3>法國自義大利　收回失土</h3>
<p>維希三日中央社電海通社訊，法政府公報昨日宣稱：義軍於一九四〇年六月佔領之曼頓城（Mentone）在法南部沿海岸與義交界處）之行政權將交還法國，定於今日由地方長官却格紐正式接收。</p>
<h3>義東部德軍　採流動戰術　那港北撤德軍據守高地</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　據海通社訊：德軍退出那不勒斯，為德軍司令部之預定計劃，現德軍在阿平育山麓以大砲控制平原之軍事行動，小隊敵軍在維蘇威與阿平寗問推進，立即遭受阻止。美第五軍右翼向貝納文托（Benevento）推　亦遭遇重大困難。英第八軍僅有小隊進抵普格里亞山麓，該處有激烈之局部戰事。然敵軍在義南部無用武之地，因　塞林避免大規模之戰事繼續北進，此項閃避行動將於何時停止，德軍司令部暫守秘密，協約軍方而對於該問題甚感焦慮。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍在那不勒斯區之軍事行動，未受英美軍之干涉，有時敵軍在坦克車掩護下，企圖阻碍德軍之行動，但結果被擊退。威蘇維山附近之若干鄉村與奧太維亞諾鎮已徹退一空，德軍已退至準備優良而縮短之陣地。新戰綫一帶除偵察活動外，並無戰爭之消息。義南綫東部在卡斯特爾諾伏區（Castelnuovo）　塞拉加浦　奧拉區（Serracaqhriola）戰爭之活動大　增劇,蒙高茂萊將軍之部隊在坦克車掩護下，企關突破德軍之戰綫，很德軍之流動戰術，足以抵禦一切大規模之攻擊。當時敵「旭門」坦克軍十三輛被擊損不能行動，又有裝甲車十六輛被擊毀或起火，掩護作戰之英軍砲隊無法擊破德軍之抵抗，　高茂萊將軍於突被之企圖失敗後即中止進攻。卡斯特爾諾伏附近英軍企圖包圍德軍後　隊，但為鄰折之德軍分隊所襲，戰事仍在進行中。</p>
<h3>蘇捷擬締結　互相協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　據海通社倫敦消息，捷克逃亡政府昨日宜布：決定進行蘇捷互助協定之締給，政策決不改變，此為捷政府於九月廿四日開會時所決定。倫敦政界人士頗感驚異，因蘇聯最近曾宣布於戰事結束前，決不與逃亡政府締結任何協定。</p>
<h3>加拿大驅逐艦　遭潛艇擊沉　船員幾無一生還</h3>
<p>柏林三日巾央社電　加拿大驅逐艦「　克里亞」號已在北大西洋被德潛艇擊沉。據路透社消息，該艦船員過教者僅有一人，其餘一百四十六人均葬身魚腹，此足證據軍所使用之新魚需爆炸力之强烈。</p>
<h3>蘇駐英大使　古基夫到任</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹三日中央社電　據英京消息：蘇聯駐英新大使古塞夫，於星期六抵達倫敦，古氏前任蘇聯駐加拿大公使。</p>
<h3>德蘇諒解說　柏林闢謠</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國外交部發言人昨日力闢英美蘇方面所傳德蘇有諒解可能訊。發言人對外國記者稱，蘇聯政府散播此項謠言之動機，大致有三：其一，為使人以為蘇聯之地位，現時極為强固，故德國準備與莫斯科妥協。其二，爲欲使反軸心國憂懼德蘇分別締和，因而迫使反軸心國，加緊其第二戰綫之軍事行動。其三，為欲以此使反軸心圍更願接納蘇聯之政治要求。在另一方面，英國亦有其傳播此項謠言之理由，蓋可以此為籍口，而使其對蘇之再作讓步得振振有辭。發言人指出關於此事，瑞典之報紙　亦有輿渠作同一見解者，並　勞之眞相，已於外長里賓特洛甫最近之演說中表明之。</p>
<h3>烏塞特繼任　緬甸財長</h3>
<p>仰光三中央社電　緬甸財長戴英莫氏，八月三十日榮轉駐日大使後，其繼任人選，內定爲樞密院顧問兼仰光市長鳥塞特氏。</p>
<h3>英登陸艇一艘　在法海岸擊沉</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊：一日晚間有二百噸之英國登陸用舟艇一艘，侵入法國海岸布倫地區，德軍常即將其擊沉。</p>
<h3>戰時蘇聯的外交　蘇聯戰力分析之三（二）</h3>
<p>英美蘇三國間不洽</p>
<p>英美蘇三國問的不洽，德蘇開戰以來，屢成問題，尤以每次舉行英美會談時，反軸心陣綫雖期望甚切，惟史太林迄未參加，因而屢成為曦論的對象。</p>
<p>把英美蘇三國間對立，予以過大的評價，這自然是務望的見解，是很危險的，以德蘇開戰為契機。蘇聯和英美在遂行對德戰爭這一點上結合起來。可是雖結合起來了，但是若摟若離。</p>
<p>用極公式的說法來說，蘇聯是社會主義國家，其最後目標，不僅在完成一國的共產主義，而且在世界的赤化。縱令今日在德蘇戰爭無暇及他，舉所有國力集中於對德戰的推行、但史太林在夢寐之問，也不忘此事—世界的赤化。</p>
<p>反之，英美二國是典型的帝國主義國家，其最後的目標在帝國主義的支配世界。此次世界大戰，是被英美二國之帝國主義的野心所誘發的，英美恐懼向建設歐洲新秩序而邁進的德國，但是更恐懷蘇聯的布爾歇縱克主義。</p>
<p>這根本上不相容的蘇聯和英蘇，因為在逮行對德戰爭這一點上結合起來，所以常然互相想利用對方，使自己的地位有利，因利害關係的三個國家在利害上產生劇　，亦是當然的。</p>
<p>所以英美和蘇聯，靦將來情勢的學化，或許惹起武力的衝突，亦未可知造在這裹，蘇聯所希望的是要求開闢第二戰綫，英美所希　的　德蘇戰的長期化。即蘇聯不願僅用獨自的力量抵當德國，　　戰力，而使英美二國開闢第二戰綫，節約本國的戰力，同時，並想抵消英美的戰力。</p>
<p>他方，英美二國在可能節圍內遷延第二戰綫的開關，使德蘇戰長期化，以節約本國軍隊的戰力而消耗德蘇二軍的戰力，如其可能，希望德蘇二國二敗俱傷。但問題並不如此簡單。</p>
<p>第一，紅軍戰力再評價的結果，英美二國顯巳落後甚遠，如其把在歐洲的旣有權益完成失掉，則歐洲的帝國主義的野心之實現，將極困難。但如根據上述理由　開闢第二戰綫，則不能達到減削蘇聯戰力的目的，英美被挾在痛曾的夾板中。</p>
<p>因此，在本年一月的加　勃期加會談上，關於怎樣應付第二戰　的間題，不能達到結論，且在本年五月的華盛頓會談上，意見亦不能一致。不久西西里島之戰吿終，怎樣應付第二戰綫愈成為當前的問題，以至市此次的奎貝克會談，但如其上述複雜的情形不掃除，則關於第二戰綫問題，英美二國到底不能達到結論。</p>
<p>而且關於對德國的問題，英美和蘇聯之間，也有着難以逾越的鴻溝，英美二國表面上說德對戰爭的目的是打倒納粹政權，但暗中則企圖貫澈對德國人民之帝國全義的文配。</p>
<p>對此，蘇聯意在用自己的見解處理之。這種對立，在英美兩國和蘇聯的對義大利政策的態度上，也可以看出。</p>
<p>即在此次的奎貝克會談上，會議舉行之前，英美輿論界雖希望史太林參加，但不要說中太林，連蘇聯的代表也一個沒有參加，而且蘇聯政府在八月十二日經由塔斯通信社發衷極率產的聲明說：</p>
<p>「會談中並未邀請蘇聯，會談的性實上，蘇聯的代表毋須參加，故未曾參加。」</p>
<p>雖然如此，但羅斯福和邱吉爾　然希望史太林參加，會談告終後，傳出了美國方面的赫爾　威爾斯，和英國方面的邱吉爾，艾登，將訪問莫斯科。</p>
<p>塔斯通信社何故發表不僅外交上一見即極不適當，而且是不必要的聲明呢？這雖可以有種種解釋，但無論如何，我們又認識了英美二國問步調的錯亂。</p>
<p>以上英美蘇三國間的不和，跟着戰局的進展，必然愈形激化。蘇聯如何處理這問題，遂行對德戰爭，是極有興味的問題。（全文完：翔　自同盟世界還　一二二三號）</p>

<h3>保健曙光　於民族有深切關係　是人生事業的根基</h3>
<p>健康是人生一切事業的根基，强盛的國家，健全的社會，決不建立在孱弱多病的國民上面，這是鐵一般的事實。日本民族研究所長高田保馬博士曾經說過「國民欲克服貧因與勞苦，必須具有强健的身心，此乃民族，永遠生存與發展的推進力。」這幾句顛撲不破的話，更可加深我們對於國民健康和民族生存有深切關係的認識。因此我們感覺到怎樣來增進國民健康。是一個非當重大的問題，同時又感覺到折年來萌生的保健運動，正是針對着這個重大問題的唯一答案。</p>
<h3>保健沿革</h3>
<p>提起保健，世界各國都已早着先鞭，收獲偉大的效果，他們的成功，可說完全得力於疾病保險制度的確立。此項疾病保險，濫餳於一八七一年，而美國　Baylor　大學的金堡博士。實為首先嘗試成功的一人，博士在一九二九年曾經替一千二百五丁學校教員似險，保費每人每月不過五角。因試驗成功，引起一般人的極大注意。至一九三五年，紐約城有花玲赫司脫小姐，聯合幾個公寓的職員，開始此項事業，一年內會員總數　達八萬四千人，而新會員的加入月約五千人，進展的迅速。可謂一日千里。一方面固然由於此項疾病保險制度，為人民所急切需要，而另一方面，實由一般人民對於保健意義有深切的暸解。所以能引起他們的熱烈擁護，這是因果相生的必然趨勢。現在此項疾病保險制度，已益發趨於完密，在組織方面，有公共的和私家的分別。前者為强迫性質，凡商店工廠的職員以及一般公務人員都强迫投保，保費由服務處所的當局擔任三分之一，而由投保人擔任三分之二，此項保險費約為職員每月薪額的百分之四至七，有指定的醫師和醫院常年為投保人服務。後者完全與前者不同。凡家庭婦孺以及一般自由職業的人，都可自由加入私家疾病保險機關，請醫和住院，都不受拘束，所化費用，事筏可向保險機關收囘。</p>
<h3>受惠前例</h3>
<p>各國人民在疾病保險制度之下，身受其惠者，眞如恒河之沙，無可計數，現在舉出一二例，以概其餘。在美國有一五十七歲的紐約老人，當初有人勸他入會，老人極十反對，可是在入會後的三星期，他老人家却因患着嚴重的肺炎症而被送入醫院，等到痊瘉出院，醫院賬上所開的費不過二元六角眞出乎他意料之外，而不禁歌功頌德起來。還有一位失業的朋友，因失足跌傷得很利害，送入醫院後，經用X光和藥物治癢，約住院一星期，痊瘉出院，竟未醫分文，像這樣切身受惠的人，眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<h3>環境需要</h3>
<p>在這個大時代中，健康問題，實最感重要，一方面因生活高漲，衣食維艱，怎樣才能負起生活的重擔，這是一般人所憧憬着的一個重大問題。而另一方面國家正踏上復興建設的新途，一切的一切，却需要國民的協力，凡是國民一份子怎樣才能不負國家的期望，而擔常起各人應盡的吿任，這是一個電大的聞題，而概括的說一句，這兩付放在眼前的千斤重擔，決不是孱弱多病的人所能肩負，這是絕對沒有疑義的。所以在這個大時代中的人，為個人生存計，自不能不重視健康，而為國家生存計，實更不能不十二分的重視健康。此外單就社會經濟情形而論，由於現在醫藥的昂貴，以致一般人的無力就醫，這一點對於公共健康和社會生產力方面的種種影響，也不能說不大。在上述的種種情形之下，我們感到為增進國民健康而厲行，保健實為環境所急切需要，在一般民衆心理上說不定有如大旱之望雲霓。</p>
<h3>保健眞諦</h3>
<p>保健的重要巳如上述，而保健的工作我們認為不僅在於醫藥治療卞面，因為一個人在患病以後方始作醫藥救濟，縱然治療得宜，得以早復健康，然而在經濟時間精神以及工作諸方面，都已不免受到相當損失。所以曲突徒薪，勝於事後補苴，而眞正的保健工作，端在推進一切預防疾病的工作，這是健康的眞諦，也就是增進國民健康的終南捷徑</p>
<p>中國保健協會，是在社會殷切喁望以及各界人士熱烈贊助之下產生的一個最新保健組織，爲適應社會的急切需要，參照各國保健制度，先行成立指導和服務兩部。現該會爲普通服務社會起見，公開徵求會員，各界加入的很由踴躍。</p>

<h3>購小麥製麵粉　訂立收配公約　違者取銷資格並予處分</h3>
<p>粉麥專業委員會統一收購蘇浙皖三省曁上海南京兩市小麥後，經銀行團之貸款努力收購，並規定各委託商收麥及麵紛廠配麥必須訂立公約，茲探錄公約如下：</p>
<h3>委託商收麥公約</h3>
<p>「茲願運照全國商業統制總會，對於麵粉小麥統收統配之方策，申請買資小麥業務，除將所收小麥依照貴委員規定配給量，直接售與受委託之麵粉廠外，如有飲額悉數聽由貴委員會給價收買，並遵守貴委員會有關收買小麥一切規章，倘有遠反等　　　　　　　　　　　　嚴重之處分。」</p>
<h3>麵粉廠配麥公約</h3>
<p>「茲願遵照全國商業統制總會，對於麵粉小麥統收統配之方策，申請小麥製造麵粉，當絕對遵守量委員會一切有關紛麥收配規單，及后列各條款，倘有違反願受取銷登記資格及嚴重之處分。　購入小麥悉照規定之配給量不得溢額。　購入小麥悉由指定向責委員會登記之委託商行辦理。　已購入之小麥決不再有賣出之行為。　如遇小麥總收買量不足時，聽憑照原配給量比　　　　　　　　　　　交由貴委員會照公定價格收買，決不另行出賣。」</p>
<h3>本市物價　漸趨平衡</h3>
<p>邇月來本市各業物價經各當局極力調濟合理設法改善以來，已漸趨平衡，尤其於政府收買棉紗布以來流資大都己被吸收，但投機市倫雖圖最後掙扎，卒被當周人員分別查獲，依法懲處，以致遭受停業數天，或處以罰金等己有數起，至於各業布塲置造，終因當局對統制制度增廣神速，故一般持貨老莫不焦慮萬分，亟求將囤貨出籠，即各業商店亦均脫貨求現，大減價大特價之現象亦復競爭脫售，故物價自形日臻抵羅，至滬市金融市況，仍平靜如　，殆赤紋銀軍票聯鈔拆息市價均無變動，公債股票則因市塲無稽流言濃厚，中途曾一度疲軟旋又同平，現交易仍以股票買　最　　　　　　　　　　　活，幷得中儲銀行儘量調劑頭寸，銀根已趨鬆，食米因米糧統制委員會積極準備收買工作，民食已趨安定，市價低平，共他雜糧豆麥市價亦見下降，日用食品公定售價平穩不動，黑市售價漲風全戢，上海整個工商市悄，較前均見穩定。</p>
<h3>黑棗荔枝乾　產薄價昂</h3>
<p>黑棗首批新貨本市及南京均有少數登塲，以收成不豐，貨品較遜、但價格此陳貨略高，至於行存陳貨久棧之後。外費利息棧租亦增昻不少，故後市亦有轉緊之象。</p>
<p>金山柱因本屆出產歉薄，而來源困難，據最近電訊，　價復升，因是甲市隨升，糯米枝出數更少，升度較高。</p>
<p>米折乏續到，但實銷屹然少動，故除同行稍有進出外，客帮問訉亦稀，致市勢甚軟</p>

<h3>中華雄霸網球壇國際賽法葡慘遭全軍覆沒　爭霸戰日本以一對二受挫  （鴻鵠）</h3>
<p>目之國際慈善繼球大賽，中，日，法，葡四強參加逐鹿，於前週六（九月二十五日）揭開戰幕。初賽秩序經主辦當局確定、日本遇法國於揭幕日交錄，另幕中華逢葡萄牙於翌日（二十六日）角逐，比賽探淘汰制為單打兩塲及雙打一塲，初賽結果日本與中華各以三對○獲全勝，分別淘汰法國與葡萄牙，同獲決賽權。經一週之休息，中日兩巨頭於前日（十月二日）仍在原處舉行爭烈戰。中華單打人材出衆。淨勝兩組，日本雙打合作佳妙，亦告得手，結果二對一。中華克退日本隊瑩　錦標。日本功虧一簧，屈居亞軍，從此國　網球壇，中華遂得執牛耳而稱盟主，全滬體育史上，我華人又增光榮燦爛之一頁，誠療事也。大賽於陳市長代表趙秘嘗長致開展幕後，並由陳市長親臨主持給獎閉幕體。三日來，褚部長，丁部長，法總領事，葡總領事　市體育會理事長沈嗣良等均先後蒞塲觀戰，惟網球水準較高，初賽兩日　衆未見踴躍。決賽時始吿滿座，是則猶待提倡者促其普及耳。球塲佈置在三省體育會潘會長領導督促下，秩序井然。門票亦因潘會長三省等努力推銷，收入可觀。有助於中日法葡慈善機關者，賓非淺顯，仁風義舉，功績固不僅在體育一方面也。</p>
<h3>日本淘汰法國</h3>
<p>日法之戰，日本神田道朝出戰法國屈倫茲夫作第二單打賽，神田老成持重，從容不迫，以逸待勞，是其得力之處。屈則年少氣盛，正手擊出有力，開球銳頸，惟反手則極軟弱，逆為對方進襲之點。屈開球得局，神田還敬成各一、屈勝一滑局後，瞬被神田奪囘，屈隨得隨失，頓形慌張，神田乃乘勢　成四對二，而以六對三取第一盤。第二盤神田兩度發球得手，屈發球則告失利，遂連失三局，至此屈似大夢初醒，力持鎮定，以高速度擊法，使神田波於奔命，連下六局，神出為之黯然失色，以三對六失守。第三盤屈因上對出力過多，破綻又見，神出如風捲飛葉，勝一光盤，結果二對一日本吿捷。雙打日本山岸成一，福士三耶對法國喬鄧，勃倫茲。雙方實力，實不相上下，　乎比數之接折，即可推知競爭之劇然。山岸較福士為穩。喬鄧較勃氏有勁，　隊之敗　在失誤與自殺較多。勃開球被擊破，山岸又取第二局、忽而喬勃以三對二超出，忽而山福以四對三　導，極　撲朔迷離，喬勃繼之造五對四優勢、而山福竟以七劉五獲取勝利，第二盤勃山開球均失利成各一。繼之法方兩度領先。日方連下三局成五對三。法方照樣還敬成六對五、但均未一鼓而下，日方見機會不司復失，乃以八對六　掙。結果直落二。日本又勝最後第一軍打日本馬塲對法國亞維格。馬正反手均有獨到之處，亞雖為法方主將，未免相形見絀亞，開球得局。馬即直下五局，亞頑抗，造四對五接近局而，而卒以四對六失　一盤。第二盤馬擊破對方開球，亞即連取三局，還以顏色。但並不稍挫馬之鋒鋩。馬竟一氣呵成五局。以六對三結束第二盤。日本淨勝兩局，總結果三對○日本淘汰法國。</p>
<h3>中華輕取葡隊</h3>
<p>中葡之役。繼於日法之戰後一日舉行。　日火傘高張，甚於盛暑賽實為中秋後之反常天氣，比賽於下午二時半開始，正當烈日當空，出塲賽　其不汗流脊背，目眩神疲，好在雙方實力懸殊。華隊　勝，易各反掌，固並未　多大氣力；否訓鑒鬥於酷　中，其不影響賽員身體者幾希、第二單打中華張定釗出鬥葡　羅柴遼。定釗為我華隊宿將。球藝雖非登峯造極喝然其堅靸不拔之精神。實非普通球　所比　。且能保持正常狀態。故年已不惑，故仍能與第一流名手一爭短長。羅係後起之秀，與隊友蘇若同為足綱　樓，惟經驗缺乏，技藝亦欠琢磨，爾張相遇。勝負固無待交手也。羅開球得局後。張即連下三局，羅開球取第五局，親又以五對二前領。曁成五對三。定釗最後曾失一得盤點，而仍以六對三輕取，第二盤形勢一面倒，定釗操縱自如。任所欲為。羅連失六局負一光盤，結果二對○中華勝利。雙打中華梁德光。蔡國基　葡隊遜納。蘇若，四將中梁遜均具對當之經驗，而演出則遜不如　，蘇功侯未至火氣太大，蔡　將才。慌張特富。遜蘇雖利國基弱點進攻，但不自爭氣，致吿敗挫，梁蘇各以發球得局。粱蔡瞬以四對一。五對二估先而以六對三取勝。第二盤蘇光開球，梁迫成各一、葡造二對一後。華隊連下四局。第五局曾有劇鬥。互失得局點數次，是盤又歸華隊比數仍為六對日，結果二對○中　　　。繼之第一軍打中華陶冠球對蔔隊卡那凡洛。小卡在乃父薰陶下技術不弱。但與冠球相較。究見稚嫩，但其作風造具大將之材，端待苦練耳。比數為六　二。六對一。小卡僅取第一盤第一。四兩局及第二盤之第四局，雙打大刀關斧。對角猛抽。陶固受人贊賞。卡亦博得好譽，不失為一精彩之賽。總結果中離以三對○學退葡葡牙。</p>
<h3>錦標決賽過程</h3>
<p>中日兩雄雌同獲決賽權、遂於前日（十月二日）舉行錦標決賽。球塲經陣雨沖洗後、益形優美、秋陽不烈。惜風勢稍大。不失為一良好天氣。第二軍打中華仍由張定釗出塲。日本則改由磯部龜雄應戰</p>
<p>磯部穩健不亞於神田。而抽擊　烈過之。尤以反手更具把握。定釗防範失　連失三局，既而急起直追。迫成各三平手。磯部再以四對三、五對四兩度超出，使定釗處危殆之境，而定釗並不氣餒，奪取兩局後來屈上。第十二局磯部曾二失得局點，失去造成各六之機會，定剑乃以七對五打破雖　而獲聯。第二盤形勢一變。定剑絕對佔上風，磯部力竭聲嘶，抵禦為艱。失却反攻能力。定定剑先取兩局後，第三局開球被擊被。成二對一。磯部仍無起色又連三局，剑終以六對二再勝，　盤有滑局三，張得二而磯得一，結果二對○中華轉取。雙打中華周冠軍蔡國蘅對日本山岸成一，福士三郎，造季中華隊，雙打惟一之弱點，而周蔡打來更不知所云，糟透糟透，尤以造蘅為甚。國際大賽中，有關國體榮譽，勝負固兵家當事，但以業周代表，選拔當局鐘辭失察之咎。對方山福球藝亦非上乘，第一盤華隊竟遭六對○光盤慘敗。第二盤，周蔡始稍振作，於日本連得二局後曾扳成各二，各三兩度平等，第七局蔡周相織失　屬點而未能後來層上，最機福士曾失一決勝點而日本卒以六謝三取勝。結果　發二華隊受挫。對戰局而既成，最後之第一軍打乃為雙方決勝點，生死關頭矣。中華陶冠球與日本馬塲滋之戰　開。四座華　歡衆咸為冠球助威，冠球果不負重望，輕取對方，使陳市長之冠軍大銀盃，歸我華隊捧回。陶技術高深，勇如馬塲。亦不得不甘拜下風。冠球先奪叫局。未見費力。馬開球扳回一局後。又連失兩局。陶乃以六對一勝。第二盤陶如水銀瀉地，導手即淨得五局，既而手下留情。使對方免吃鴨蛋。而以六對二再捷。結果為直落二。總結果中華以二對一收日本得冠軍</p>
<h3>四強實力概評</h3>
<p>總觀四強實力，華隊之單打可稱無敵：陶冠球出身　業。曾與世界冠軍鐵爾頓梵恩斯觀擊（鐵　曾來　表演），球藝確臻化境，即與前雄視全造之卡孫較量。亦無多讓，特不見其上網攔殺耳。挫小卡而克馬塲。均未見費力，亞維格更無論矣。全滬　主。當非冠球草屬。張定釗雄風猶昔，在第二單打中　稱無敵，　　第一單打之小卡頡頑，而　敗亞維納，亦具七分把握，雙打梁蔡優於周蔡，但仍非日隊之敵。與喬勃相仿耳。日本隊馬塲滋可居全賽第一造打之第二位。磯部較神田為佳，第二單打中除定剑以外，可首屬一指，雙打由岸　士際此滬上雙打人才缺乏時，宜其銀銀　露，若非　雙打　日舉行，則我陶梁搭配或王文正出塲，期由福　　樂觀矣。葡隊以卡那凡洛為祭酒。日柯拉沙選隱殊　可惟，卡著謹慎應戰，馬塲亦必能穩操勝券，羅柴遼尚未　水準。廖化之　耳。遜納蘇若之雙打，實力猶不逮喬鄧勃倫茲。為四隊之最弱者，法國隊主　亞維格。非第一流人物，　倫茲夫更不足道，　雙打喬邵勃倫茲會予由　以威脅，夫許小　。總之中　隊榮獲冠軍、並非　致，日本隊屈居亞軍，亦在情理之中。若法葡　較　，預料法可勝雙打　第一單打將屬諸葡力，第二單　法方較葡隊勝望較濃耳。</p>
<p>以上所論，係根據三日來出讓裏演者為標準，未出塲者當難加以臆斷，故不能逮以此賽而定全滬網球之名位也，全賽中角逐三盤分勝負者僅　屈一戰，其餘均為直落二結束。惟各賽員已同現疲態。較之以往之劇悶五盤者，不可同日而語。可見在塲地網球缺乏時代，球員均缺少練習機會，影響其體力與球藝之進展，欲求網球水準之增高，不亦雖乎！</p>
<h3>體壇拾零</h3>
<p>在任何球類比賽觀　之心理最為殘忍。若勝一球滿塲叫好捧上三十三大。若敗一球，則「噓」聲大作。打入十八層地獄。前後未及一分鐘。榮辱立　。此種表示足以影響球員作戰心理。前日國際網球賽時會有此種現象。</p>
<p>無錫體育塲於上週舉行籌　籃球賽。邀請上海常州蘇州無錫四軍位參加比賽，集四區精萃於一塲、實關無錫未有之盛況。上海由中靑雙球盟主「與仁」隊代表參加。結果「奈尼」無錫以六分之差，勝「與仁」奪獲錦樣。</p>
<p>華影籃球隊最近球藝突飛　　，在係健盃中竟將　悍　戰之同仁隊堅潰。實屬難能可貴。聞雙日節已應無錫錫　隊之邀。赴錫比賽。</p>
<p>華影女子籃球隊之成立。實聞中國電影史上未有之光擊紀　，　去著名影　、如胡　阮玲干單。雖演技　練、萬人欽差。惟在號靑方面，雜免有「環肥　使多愁着病」之不足，故該隊之產生。頗有價值，聞已　曄影男子釐球指導錢旭治担任，教練一　巳上執道，近聞李慶華　憂華胡楓等極感　奮，即將「剪去指甲穿上跑鞋」。顧與本市造國英雄爭一日之長。（　莊）</p>
<p>新開報與市體育會合　之上海小球聯賽。參加有九卞六隊。比雙四月之久，已圖滿結東。前日假金城銀行七樓。舉行給獎禮。到百餘人。新聞報　事長吳蘊緊主席，沈嗣良周家騏王方等演說，給獎攝影</p>
<p>市財政局南市區稽征處主任姜炳泉。為提倡體育，就全體屬員中。選出隊員。先組小型足球隊、歡迎約賽，通訉處　市西倉路六十號全振聲。</p>

<h3>珊瑚海閃電戰記　敵人航空母艦被擊沉</h3>
<p>五月四日午前○時，「發見敵人機動部隊！」的電報闖入了靜寂的空氣中，○○攻擊部隊立即準備出擊，焦急地等待着出發命令。然而出發命令終沒有卞來，所下的知是準備出擊命令。敵人逃出我閃電戰部隊的行動關外去了。充滿着必勝信念的我們。眞是非常可惜。敵人機動部隊每次出現，但一見到我們，統立刻逃走。這使我們大爲不快。</p>
<h3>發見敵人機動部隊</h3>
<p>然而至五月六日午前〇時○○分。重又接到「發見敵人的機動部隊！」敵人在那裏鬼鬼崇祟的巡弋着，大　總有什麼企圖吧！我們不能不斷然擊滅這敵人。</p>
<p>「啊！敵人的機動部隊出來了！」</p>
<p>「好的！此次不放他們逃走了！」</p>
<p>「竟然大胆出來，大槪宋日到了！」</p>
<p>伙伴們已經在預言着勝利是屬於我們的了。</p>
<p>「飛機○隊全體集合！」各營房間都接到了這傳令。</p>
<p>「命令下來了。準備出擊嗎？」</p>
<p>每個人生氣勃勃的臉上，浮上那疑問。</p>
<p>三人一堆、四人一　的，臉色興奮地在談論着機動部隊的事情。</p>
<p>「似乎是很大的部隊咯！」</p>
<p>「是飛機上打來的電報，有戰艦四艘，航空母艦一二艘，巡洋艦十　艘，驅逐艦也有十多雙！」</p>
<p>「　東西，太平洋　隊全部都來了！」</p>
<p>「不管它。那四艘戰艦和二艘航空母艦最主要，先把它打沈再說。」</p>
<p>在我們大家不言不　的中間。如道戰機漸漸地成熟了，決戰將近開始了。那決戰大　將用我們的手來進行了。</p>
<p>「每分隊整列！」</p>
<p>從飛行員那事詳細地知道了敵人的狀况。作戰的狀况。早日準備着突擊的我們。等而又等的命令，終於下來了。箭離弦而發了。飛機塲立即變成忙碌的戰塲。</p>
<p>搬運魚雷者，準備勞放角需者、搭載燃料者，整備發動機者，各人依着自已所配置的工作血紅　眼，用熟練的手法，在跑來跑去的工作着。</p>
<p>魚　搬來了。　魚　員的心魂都寄托在那上面的魚需，在薄薄的涂着」唇油的下面淡淡地。銳　地，　射着精鐲的光采。一見即知道它蘊藏着多麼偉大的力量啊！不發則已，發則必中，無論怎樣艨艟的巨艦，一擊之下、立成粉碎。魚需員在祈求一着：</p>
<p>「怎樣放出去。才能夠命中」。</p>
<p>爲着這。忘即了飲食睡眠，貫注着整個神經。在整備着魚雷。</p>
<p>而我們也在祈求着：「怎樣才能射中，」於是，　撫摸孩子們的頭一般，撫着魚雷的頭。</p>
<p>地點　爲惡劣，沒有像內地部隊般，一切器且都在手　，飲食都很怱促，戰伴們用精神的力量，完全克服一切惡省的條件，逐漸裝備起來。</p>
<p>太陽向西方的水平綫下沉去，暮色蒼茫中，一瞥微明的天光，尙　棧着不肯　離。四周的景色。不久完全變了，夜幕籠罩地海面。寂靜地，從那裏　過一陣蟲嗚的聲音。一然而在燈火管制下的戰塲中，不能點着很明亮的燈。祇能在昏暗的電燈光下，做着工作，於是在黑暗中，一架又一架地。帶備迅速地完成。</p>
<p>「現在完畢了。很靠得住哪！」</p>
<p>所有的障碍。戰伴們都把它完全克明了。之後只有等待出發的命令。完畢了辛苦的工作後的戰伴們的臉上，浮映着欣喜的臉色。</p>
<p>我在天色，尙未完全黑暗已把發動機的準備　全　舒齊了。「現在好了，無論怎樣飛罷！都可以放心的。」燃料，魚雷也都巳經裝上去了。我愛機的戰鬥準備完全告路了。</p>
<p>深夜。無數的螢火。飛機交織着。倏明倐滅。在南卞字星明亮地輝照着的大空下，好泰的心地撫　着汗流來背的肌膚，夜風一陣陣吹拂着。心裏在想着。能夠把參加大海戰的身體洗一次澡。精神一定更好；然而一想去在樣　不趁手的戰地，述一口水都沒有喝。就只有和衣而臥。準備隨時右命令下來。</p>
<p>當値下士官發表了明日的預定。「索敵機○架，○時○○分出發！」</p>
<p>「突擊隊○時○○分整列！全體四時起床！」</p>
<p>明天就要和代表一億國民的美國艦隊作一死戰。我們懷抱着絕大的期待，在默禱着：</p>
<p>「明天淸一定設法　和美國艦隊碰頭！」…</p>
<p>燃點着戰門意識的海鷲的血、波沸揚起來之後，就不容易使他平靜在焦燥中勉强躺下了，明大就要文戰的念頭，興奮得便不能睡熟，祗能默數着一。二。三。四…在不知不覺中睡熟了。</p>
<h3>出發之晨</h3>
<p>天朋了，　五月七日午後四時。</p>
<p>「全體起床！」</p>
<p>一脚踢開被氈。跳起身來。</p>
<p>南國之晨，天色尙未大明。皎潔的月兒，尙殘掛在天邊。無數的星星在眨着眼。執　之秋之拂　，空氣非常淸鮮。伸開二手，伸一伸懶腰，呼一口清鮮空氣，在內地。春天尚未完全過去呢！而此地不久就是冬天了。</p>
<p>飛機被朝霧沒濕着，靜靜地躺在那裏。</p>
<p>突然。發動機的轉動聲，打破了拂曉的靜寂，怒吼起來了。</p>
<p>我跑到飛機傍。開動馬達，把發動機轉動。</p>
<p>今天是決定我一生的日子。是死是活，祇有神才知道。</p>
<p>「愛機喲！請你爭氣一點。拼一拼吧！」</p>
<p>我撫摸着愛機，心裏這樣祈求着。</p>
<p>馬達試轉的結果，都極良好。毫無障碍。寄託着生命的發動機，無論機　使用多少時間、都可以放心。然而尙細心地檢點各部。細至於一針，小至於一　，如其有毛病，則幾名駕駛員的生命，立即就要發生危險。因惑到自已所負職責—直接準備發動機—的重大，乃精密地檢點着。所以和地上員一回爲參加海戰的愛機淸掃一切，如同整理自己所穿的衣衫一樣。</p>
<p>機動部部隊X架，已經軸動推進機起飛了。各自依着素敵綫的方向進發　海戰的卞向，和這素敵部隊也有很大的關係，這　中如有一架有所發見，相信一定能使我們的作戰行動有利。</p>
<p>「整列！」</p>
<p>機員們緊張地　隊伍排列整齊了。</p>
<p>隊長吿訴我們敵情，並對突擊應加注意的事項，叫我們稍待三十分鐘，就可以出發。這三十分鐘的待　，稍微使我們有些失　。</p>
<p>「啊！今天又要被　網了！」</p>
<p>感到不妥地搖搖頭。，彎下腰去。操練着飛機的作戰。</p>
<p>「好歹我今天總要一發把它擊沈」</p>
<p>我應要能夠擊沈一只，雖死無恨。</p>
<p>「一定要擊沈！」</p>
<p>戰伴們決死之色，溢於麗宇。</p>
<p>「高度○○，速力○○，距離○○，發射！用○○全速力退避！」</p>
<p>「一靠近敵艦，射手即用機槍掃射，出現在甲板上的都殺掉！」</p>
<p>「射手巳經把機關槍端正好。準備射　的樣子。如其遭迅敵人，定必轟沈他幾艘大戰艦。若有不能平安歸來的。戰伴們一定替他報仇。有以安慰他在天之靈。他們見到我們轟沈了大戰艦，航空母艦。雖在冥冥之中，想也舍笑稱快吧！</p>
<p>我們願意馬上就出發焦燥地跑來跑去，等待着出發命令，戰伴們等得不耐煩起來，時時跑到機旁檢點魚雷的搭載狀况，視察發動機的各部份。</p>
<p>索敵機在幹些什麼？遲　沒有報告回來。</p>
<h3>出發</h3>
<p>「整列！」一整列！</p>
<p>這號令響遍了飛機塲的每個角落裏。</p>
<p>「此次眞的出戰了。○○一列。請發動，排成</p>
<p>我開動了馬達把飛機排在○○一隊。各精銳機的發動，一齊怒吼起來了。</p>
<p>推進機急激地旋轉着，沐浴着朝日的銳利的　光，反射出一片强烈　　目的銀色的光。</p>
<p>「整列！」指揮官○○大尉、徐徐地登壇。下着命令。</p>
<p>「數人的戰鬥機出現了！」「據到電報。因此知道敵人機動部隊已在　近我們。○○機正在索敵　　。我們現在也　出　搜索　進擊敵人機動部隊。」</p>
<p>各人的臉上。都浮　　緊張而欣喜的臉色，服睛輝耀着異術的光彩。</p>
<p>我們多麼幸福啊！生而爲男子身，得以參加　光輝的海戰。</p>
<p>部隊長向機員發出簡單而嚴兩的攻擊命令！</p>
<p>「敵人漸漸在靠近機來，現在起開始搜素進擊了。希望大家冷靜地，沈着地，取猛地，果敢地，發揮日常所鍛鍊的百發百中的神技。XX隊也在出動着。然而本隊典此無　，我們應該獨力擊滅敵艦隊，決不落在他人後而？最後，祝諸君成功！出　！」</p>
<p>出發時的時候將於降一臨了，出征者，送行者，在激動的一瞬間大家緊緊地握着手：</p>
<p>「啊！出征了！一定要平安歸來的喲！</p>
<p>口　雖在遭樣說着，但是雖也不希望生還。想到和長期間整備同一飛機的戰伴這次或許是最後的訣別，胸中不禁充滿着一種說不出的情縤。</p>
<p>把發動機又開了一遍，結果，認爲一切無礙，乃讓給駕駛員，漸漸地出發。留下來不出發的戰伴，排在滑走路的兩傍，送我們飛上天空。戰伴們立在沙　滾滾中揮帽相送，我們也揮手作答：</p>
<p>「出去幹了！一定得勝囘來！」</p>
<p>離隊了，不管是生是死、我們　知道完成任務、所謂盡人事以待天命。</p>
<p>飛機隊伍遂漸在沙　漠　中離開陸地，　　的下方、是我們朝夕相處巳　很　　的飛機塲。</p>
<p>和　機塲作最後的決別　、勇敢地向戰塲進　。編成隊伍，向無邊無際的海角天涯，搜索敵人。</p>
<p>軍突擊隊在　　着</p>
<p>碧的海連着海。滇　的白雲首尾一片片啣接着，極目所見，除海和當以外，不　他物。</p>
<p>那中問有着勇往邁前的大編隊，燃起了一發必中的氣槪。乘着大和精神，前去進擊。</p>
<p>南國碧澄的海，灼熱的太陽，閃閃地照耀着，實在是美麗的時俟。前次二月二十日，攻擊機XX架，爲搜素同樣的敵方機動部隊而翱翱於南海大空那天的氣槪，不正和今天一樣嗎？</p>
<p>在那次海戰中，敵人的航空母艦被我們擊沉，但我們也右九架飛機自炸。有許多戰伴化成護國之神。復仇之念，不禁油然而起。如其我們屠滅敵人的網隊，那麼，在靖國神社的戰友們，將多麼欣喜啊！</p>
<h3>等待中的「敵人發見了！」</h3>
<p>八時五分，索敵機發來電報：</p>
<p>「發見敵人，在派尼特島的一五○度，一三○里，針路三○度。」</p>
<p>電報員一把搶過電報稿子。</p>
<p>啊，我們等待這「敵人發見！」的需報已經很久了。</p>
<p>偵察員照着電報在地圖上把敵人的通路記起來，決定海戰的預擬牠點及一預定時刻。</p>
<p>電報員注視着收報機，等待着命令和索敵機所報告的敵情。</p>
<p>索敵機的第二次電報又來了：</p>
<p>敵人的位置，派尼特島的一四五度，一六五擊似</p>
<p>敵人似乎想攻擊我們的基地，漸次肉基地方</p>
<p>海戰的預定時刻是從十二時到一時之間。我們的命運。個在三小時之後就要決定了。</p>
<p>在高度幾千公尺上，一　瞭望海面，探素敵人。見到一條白帶似的波紋，立刻緊張起來。</p>
<p>索敵機又來電報。戰艦二，大型巡洋艦二，驅逐艦二，速力二○節。」</p>
<p>接着又：「大巡洋艦在戰艦二艘前面，咦，航空母艦那裏去了？」</p>
<p>航空母艦不見。那真奇怪。</p>
<p>昨天的電報，不是說有戰艦四艘，母艦二艘，大巡洋艦十餘艘嗎？其餘的那裏去了？」</p>
<p>機　廳到和昨天的電報所報吿的數目不同，有些不怏。</p>
<p>「那母艦不在，眞是可借！」</p>
<p>熱而今天在海面的夕陽上，擊滅的敵人的桅杆，則是親眼目睹的，不　在夢中。</p>
<p>隔着窗子看時，兩舷的發動機，聲勢凜然，極爲穩怏。</p>
<p>X時XX分，素敵機又來電報：「派尼特島的一七五度，一○五里，針路一八○度，速力三○節。」完全接觸了。</p>
<p>我們一面感謝素敵機，一面　向　驀進。</p>
<p>敵人在針路一八○度改變針路、用三○節的高速力向南遁走。</p>
<p>那如同飛蛾撲火。巳經進入我突擊機行動圈了，敵人無論如何般　不能脫　了。</p>
<p>戰機愈趨成熟了。</p>
<p>不久。島黑的「陣雲一，掩蓋當頭，陣雨沛然下降。氣候的劇變，稍微感到一點不便。飛出XX高度的雲下，或左或右地閃避並突破陣雨。機內，陣雨的水滴。跳躍翻滾着。（待續）</p>

<h3>生的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 俞若文</p>
<p>牀底下忽起了一連串，嚓嚓嚓嚓　的聲響，甜曖着的銅匠阿明猛的驚醒過來；這聲響雖然微弱得似乎無關緊張。也在阿明聽來，竟然好像是一顆五百磅　彈的炸聲，駭　他全身發冷！</p>
<p>「他媽的，老鼠求籤，不是吉兆啊！」</p>
<p>靜開了惺忪的睡眼。他喃喃說。一而就使勁地用腳在牀上敵了幾下，牀底下的那雙小動物居然也顯「識相」，一磆碌向屋角裏溜去了。</p>
<p>近來他時常聽見這老鼠「求簽」的聲音；據說這是一個不好的預兆；阿明本來是不相信什麼神鬼的，對於這所謂「老鼠求籤的渾話向來極力反對。可是這二年來，經過他父親的過世，和他妹妹的不治之後，他對於這「老鼠求簽」的傳說忽地亦變成一個忠誠的信徒了；因爲在這二次「大事」的前幾天，他阿明曾經連夜聽見過那怪樣的聲音。從此以後，他對那「嚓嚓」的聲音是懷着旣懼又恨的心情的。今晚復又聽見了這可咀咒的聲音。難道又要發生什麼事　了麼？阿朋的心開始蕩蕩地不安了。</p>
<p>他輕輕地摸了睡在他旁邊的孩子，覺得孩子很安靜地睡着，這才慢慢地閉了眼，他很明瞭今晚回以會這樣機警，連這樣一陣微弱的聲響也會使他驚醒；於是昨晚的一幕又淸醒地搖幌在他的眼前，使他痛苦地嘆了一口長氣。</p>
<p>那是在七八個鐘點以前，　正太陽下了地平綫，暮色一陣濃似一陣的時候，阿明不聲不響拖了他的剛才生了一個多月，然而已經瘦得像一隻小猴猻的小阿明到同孚路孩子的媽媽處去偷奶吃。這「偷奶」的名詞並不是作者過甚其詞，是很「名符其實一的。你想：自已的妻子當了別人家的奶媽，妻子的奶水是　該給另一個孩子去吃的了，自己的孩子當然已經沒有份兒。但是這孩子生來就命苦，自已媽媽的親奶水吃不着倒也罷了，他爸爸連奶糕也經鈿天天買給他吃，於是就拖到他親媽媽處去吃一點不　當吃的奶水，還不是在偷麼？就是阿朋自己也承認是在偷，所以常他每次抱了孩子去偷奶吃的時刻，總是偷偷摸摸，不聲不　的，這一次常然也不能例外。</p>
<p>他走到同孚路一條約定的衖中，不一刻。孩子的媽急忽怱地奔來了，也不及　什麼話，拉出奶子就塞進孩子的嘴裏。</p>
<p>「唉，我覺得孩子天天在瘦—你看已　瘦得不像樣了！…奶糕給他吃　　？唉！奶糕又是那麼　…可憐的孩子啊！」阿明嫂緊拖着孩子，眼淚一滴滴地落了下來。</p>
<p>「粥汁是給他吃些的，可是這幾天就不十分要吃。」阿明很擔憂地說。</p>
<p>「不十分要吃麼？……」</p>
<p>可是未等她說完，阿明嫂的險色陡然變了！她　　她的東家奶奶正從弄口　了進來。</p>
<p>她趕忙把孩子　　給阿明，孩子正吮得入味，忽地被拉去了　裏的奶子，就狠命地皺了　眉頭，</p>
<p>這時候，東家奶奶已經鐵青着臉，站在他們的面前了。她指着阿明嫂兒猛地駡道：</p>
<p>「好！妳倒有這樣大的胆走到外而來　向已的孩子！我給妳自由的走漁走出、原是看得起你，想信你、想不到妳是這般狼心！我問妳，妳是不是在要我孩子的命！告訴你、我暗地裏已經跟妳多次了，今天可給我看見了啊</p>
<p>「奶奶！…」阿明嫂一時被嚇昏、站在那裏　說不出一句話了。</p>
<p>「很好！很好！明天就替我滾！好菜好飯給妳吃，是叫妳來餵自己的孩子的！一說着，東家奶奶氣沖沖地回去了。</p>
<p>「這種奶媽真是可惡！」觀衆之一咕　道。</p>
<p>「唉！這真是一個幾重的社　問　呢！」另一個　裏靑年感喟地　着，</p>
<p>阿明也無心再去　　　的話了。他拖了孫子　急收　地奔回了家；亦不　孩子的飢和餓，冷和熱，他　然就躺倒在床上了　這麼着在剎那問追憶了昨晚的往事，阿明無力地又嘆了一口氣，同時　得全　的細胞好像在擴張、擴張、他打了一個呵欠，嫩嫩地伸了仲二條腿鼾聲又從他的鼻孔裏出來了。</p>
<p>可是沒有多少時候，阿明又破一種驚心的動魄的聲音嚇醒、他睜開眼來。房裏己經亮透，只看見他的　子阿明嫂蹲在床邊、雙手推動着床上的孩子、在沒命的叫哭，攸陡然　下了　，木然問道：</p>
<p>「孩子忠麼樣。…………」</p>
<p>孩子怎麼樣！你這個死鬼啊！孩子已經斷了氣！你還躺着，……啊！心肝啊，心肝啊，媽眞不應該蹤開你啊！啊。心肝啊。你死得這樣傷心………心肝啊。我的小心肝啊……」</p>
<p>阿明嫂一邊嚎哭着，一邊用脚彭彭地敲動着地板。</p>
<p>「可是妳……妳　麼現在會囘來的？……」阿明早已驚得呆了；他　料不到孩子竟會在這個時候死去。更料不到自己竟會這樣糊塗，連孩子斷了氣　也不知道；尤其料不到他的妻子會恰恰在這　時候囘家來，他硬着頭皮訕訕地這樣問了。</p>
<p>「怎麼會回來的！你忘卻了昨晚出的事麼？東家奶奶停了我的生意了，我這麼哀哀的求也求不轉來、只得走回家來，可是進門一看孩子，已經死了、身體也已經冰冷了。看來已經死了多時，你這浮屍！你　這麼糊塗……心肝啊，心肝啊，媽害了你，不給你奶吃、餓了你……心肝啊……」</p>
<p>阿明目不轉睛地盯着床上的孩屍，淚水不自主地流了下來！</p>
<h3>農夫之子</h3>
<p>— 徐揚</p>
<p>我是一個農夫之子，終年不知有辛勞，生活宛似無期的苦工，犂，耙，是我的鐐銬；我不會抬頭望天，只默默看秧水的田中，月亮的影子微抖，歸來披一肩夕陽，臨睡叉去撫一撫牡牛。</p>
<h3>靜夜</h3>
<p>— 趙驤</p>
<p>掩上着卷。伸一個懶腰，同時打着呵欠，我彷彿從神奇的　國裏夢遊了一趟同來！</p>
<p>我發覺，周遭是這樣的寗靜，白天的市聲滅絕了，整個的世界像落進了一個死亡的陷井。</p>
<p>唯一報時的小鐘，在走到十時一刻的地方也「嘎」然而止，是疲倦？抑倫　？</p>
<p>風，輕微的打窗口吹進來，有一點沁腦的凉意。混濁的頭腦開始從粉紊中淸醒，猛的我感到：一雨成秋！臨晚還在飄着的雨絲，不知從什麼時候起也已止住了。</p>
<p>漆黑的天空，不見一顆小星吐射一縷微弱的光芒，也找不到銀芽樣一弧明月！</p>
<p>趕緊閉上窗戶，扯上窗帘，我要把那一縷魄弱的愁絲跟外界切斷。不再爲牠而悲哀！</p>
<p>屋子裏只有一片淡淡的光芒，停勻的落在墻上，桌上和地上，沒有一點聲息，沉寂得像是深山的古寺，而自己彷彿是古寺中的老僧：作着潛行的苦修：但古幷般的心情，我却不能不掀起一脈漣漪，也許六根畢電還未淸凈，腦海還時時不免知與情的糾結！</p>
<p>我常常作着離間怪誕的夢，是古銅色樣的沉重，是銀絲樣的機細，是落紅樣的輕浮，是紫丁香的憂鬰—我沉醉於理想的國境，憧憬於光明的問地，一縷輕烟　的　喟！然而，生活的鞭子抽　着我的背脊時，我從痛苦中醒來，揉揉重重的眼皮，我抬起頭看浩了現實的塲面—一幅激烈的生存　門國！</p>
<p>從那圖盡裏我看見光怪陸離的面面，但是我倒底看淸楚了一點：懦怯的沒落了，萎避的跌進死亡的深淵，退縮的被踐踏在脚下，祇有勇敢的。磨厲着牙齒前進，才踏上了一條勝利的坦道！</p>
<p>靜夜，我的耳邊却響着一片嘶殺聲！</p>
<h3>教室雜寫</h3>
<p>— 士貞</p>
<p>走進教室的門，嗡嗡的嘈雜的聲音，在敎室各處響着，東一簇，西一堆的人，說說笑笑什麼都有。</p>
<p>「將！將！…好！抽車將！…」多麼神氣的叫聲在窗口的一堆人中發出來。</p>
<p>「不要老，車填…抽車將，抽屁！」</p>
<p>「是咈，對你說抽不到抽不到，這種棋有什麼怠思。倒小是走砲的好…　一位同學埋怨地說。拍！一聲不知誰在　位同學的後腦上打了一下，「媽的！誰打的：棋子輸了不要　，」又專心到棋子上去了。</p>
<p>「哈哈！好！走這只，你自已要沒有啦，將…。」另外一個同學興奮地說。對多同學七手八脚地你着，我着。</p>
<p>「你們不要繞好喝？滿好的棋子給你們弄昏了，你們自己也好去偕來着…」</p>
<p>「雜和你繞，自己洋盤，諾諾，走這只，將死…將死什麼？」一陣陣混亂的吵鬧聲。</p>
<p>「好！將死了，起碼起碼輸掉…」</p>
<p>「不要驕傲，算你會着」一盤棋結束了互相爭着勝負你一句我一句說個不休。</p>
<p>不知誰把一隻皮球向一個同學的頭上拋來，眞巧從這個同學的頭上又彈到其他一位同學的頭上引起了一陣笑聲。連忙去拾預備囘擊。給一位同學用脚踢開了，於是教室　為球塲了。</p>
<p>一位同學拎到了球，「喂！派司…派司！快」一隻皮球立刻從一位同學的手裏到了另外一個同學手裏，一個不小心，落在地上了。</p>
<p>「啊！。搶啊！…」一羣同學立即擁了過去，一起壓在皮球上，有的在地上打滾。</p>
<p>「級長來了…級長來了！」「級長來好了，拋拋球有搶道理！」級長在門口出現了。看　許多同學混　地在地上，高聲叫着：做捨！做捨！」跑上去把壓在地上　學身上的同學拉了　來一起來！你們不要再吵不要怪我不貿面子，罰小楷：」一位同學爬了起來。整整衣服，笑嘻嘻地說：「裝樣沒搶到、諾！…喂！」又把皮球向一位同學拋去。</p>
<p>你們再拋小楷二張，不要懊悔，」級長擺出威嚴了，於是各位同學停下來，背後在說：「眞沒意思。罰小楷，小學裏派頭…」「噯！像煞有介事，罰小楷…。」</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 晦𤲅</p>
<p>遇的厚薄，是不能判斷一個人的能力大小：反之工作的勤惰，是能斷定一個人的前途光明與否。</p>
<p>一個不能把握　現實，勤勤懇懇地工作，而徒憧憬着未來的人，結果祗右掉在痛苦的深淵中，永無拔足的一日。</p>
<p>在年輕讀書的男和女，腦海中沒有愛字蘊藏在裏面，一心向學，努力求知，結果成就是相當的驚人。反之終日，沈沒在愛的甜蜜中，學業也就日漸荘蕪，前途也就日慚暗淡，貫獻也就稀少得可憐。</p>
<p>天下沒有永遠痛苦的事，也沒右永遠快樂的事，因爲苦到盡頭，甜的泉源也就不斷地湧來，反之樂到極頂，悲苦的事也就相繼而生。這是互爲因果，絲毫不爽的。</p>

        <h1>1943.10.04</h1>
<h3>Editorial: The Future of Jiangsu Province's Politics and Police Administration</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province, among all provinces in the country, occupies an extremely important position in terms of geography, politics, economy, education, and culture. Therefore, Jiangsu Province's political measures serve as a model and guide for all provinces nationwide. We deeply recognize this, and when personnel in Jiangsu Province were being changed at the beginning of last month, we wrote two commentaries on September 11th and 12th, listing the gains and losses of past provincial administration and offering several suggestions: Currently, both central and local politics need reform. Local political reform can begin in Jiangsu Province, with a six-month trial period before being implemented in other provinces. Hereafter, Jiangsu Province's politics absolutely requires expert governance, eliminating bureaucratic politics. The content of modern politics, from decision-making to implementation, requires the application of scientific thinking at all times and in all places, emphasizing time and striving for efficiency, which cannot be handled by bureaucracy, perfunctory measures, or procrastination. Local self-government work should begin as soon as possible, establishing popular opinion institutions, raising the people's awareness of political participation, and promoting integration between the government and the people. Abolish local miscellaneous taxes and levies to reduce the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is particularly emphasized that Chinese politics has always failed due to personnel constraints. Although there are sometimes reform proposals, they cannot be adjusted to adapt to the facts. This reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is a good opportunity for central political reform. From the selection of government personnel, senior officials to all levels of civil servants, the standard for employment should absolutely adopt "meritocracy," reversing regionalism and factionalism. Absolute emphasis should be placed on integrity and honesty in the assessment criteria. At present, China has not yet established a solid foundation for the rule of law, and the talent, competence, and integrity of civil servants remain the greatest factors for good governance. Therefore, the issue of personnel selection deserves careful decision-making.</p>
<p>Secondly, the police affairs administration in civil affairs is extremely important. The police are the civil servants closest to the people. The quality of police administration most easily causes direct feelings among the people. The people's faith in politics is most effectively gained through the service of the police. The Ministry of Interior convened the Second National Police Administration Conference at the end of last month. We deeply feel that police administration is even more important during wartime and also wrote commentaries to contribute opinions, especially advocating for improving the legitimate treatment of police personnel, so that those with excellent knowledge and aspirations to serve are willing to join the police force and enrich police personnel. Of course, clearing out the bad elements in the police force and eliminating the corrupt elements of bureaucracy are particularly active and necessary.</p>
<p>Now, the Governor of Jiangsu Province and senior officials have been announced one after another. Governor Chen Qun was transferred from the Minister of Interior, which shows that the central government is able to value the importance of Jiangsu Province's political status. After the order for Chen's transfer was issued, he still presided over the National Police Administration Conference in the position of Minister of Interior. Therefore, based only on common sense, we judge that in Jiangsu Province's politics, at least the police administration is most likely to have a refreshing appearance, in order to inspire the people's faith in politics.</p>
<p>However, we cannot help but feel emotional after examining the list of senior officials of Jiangsu Province recently released by the government. We have absolutely no preconceived notions. Speaking only from the perspective of police affairs, its important responsibilities and arduous tasks are as described above. Therefore, the choice of person to preside over it must undoubtedly possess rich experience in police administration and a history of integrity. Even as a second choice, it must be a police administration expert who is versed in administration. If someone with absolutely no police administration knowledge is appointed, someone who does not know what police administration is, and this is said to be employing talent from the fields and selecting outstanding talents from the common people, it is simply self-deprecating and treating politics as child's play. The people still have the intellect to distinguish, and if the person in charge is an ignorant and incompetent person, it is inevitable that peers will be cited, and everyone will rush to them, acting surprised, and the result is not difficult to predict. We do not know whether the authorities considered and considered the future of Jiangsu police administration and even the entire Jiangsu Province's administration when proposing or deciding on personnel. We originally had great expectations for the new personnel of the new provincial administration of Jiangsu, but judging from the personnel of the police affairs, it has undoubtedly given the public great disappointment. We, in the position of the people of Jiangsu, in the position of the Chinese people, motivated by the enthusiasm to protect the Jiangsu authorities, the enthusiasm to protect the central government, looking forward to the future of Jiangsu politics, looking forward to the future of Chinese politics, if we do not thoroughly seek to refresh personnel and value the way of talent, then the dim and miserable environment will be impossible to break through. Alas! We only wish to worry needlessly! How could we wish to deliberately make pessimistic remarks!</p>

<h3>North China Purchases Food: Local Officials Responsible: Chairman Wang Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Beiping, 3rd: Wang Kejiao, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, spoke on the 3rd at the Provincial and Municipal Leaders Conference regarding the purchase of food. The main points of his instructions to the leaders are as follows: During this period of implementing the purchase of coarse grains, the provincial and municipal leaders should quickly decide on the amount to be supplied and the deadline for completion of the purchase for each county and district under their jurisdiction, strictly ensuring the coarse grains in the fields. Therefore, the provincial and municipal leaders need to allocate the amount to be supplied to each county and district, stipulate the amount of purchase funds allocated, and release them quickly in order to engage in appropriate purchase work. The local officials of each county and district should strictly supervise and guide the collection and transportation agencies and cooperatives responsible for the purchase, so that they can be rewarded or punished separately according to their performance. Those who behave poorly among the purchase workers and local officials and Baojia chiefs should also be severely punished. In addition, during this purchase of food, low-price distribution should also be implemented for the daily necessities of farmers, but this must be in the hands of the farmers, and private embezzlement is absolutely not allowed, so that the distribution can be appropriate.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Reporter Group Returns to Beijing Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

The group of nineteen people, led by团长 Zhao Muru, arrived in Beiping on September 26th. In addition to visiting various Chinese and Japanese institutions and touring famous historical sites, they conducted detailed investigations into the local political, economic, cultural, and educational conditions. The various institutions and civil groups of the North China Political Affairs Commission, as well as the Japanese authorities, extended a warm reception. They stayed in Beiping for five days and gained a great deal. It was originally planned to go to Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao and other places for inspection after leaving Beiping, but due to the severe epidemic prevention work in various parts of the north, travel was very inconvenient, so it was temporarily suspended. Except for five people who stayed in Beiping, the other members of the group, led by团长 Zhao, took a train back south on the morning of October 2nd and arrived in the capital at about 5 pm on the 3rd. Many members of the capital's press circles went to Pukou Railway Station to welcome them. Zhao国长 also expressed his feelings about the trip. He is scheduled to go to the Propaganda Department on the morning of the 4th to report the inspection process to Minister Lin. Mayor Zhou Xuechang will also set up a washing event for the group within a few days.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle in the Middle Reaches of the Dnieper River: German Troops Retreat from the Taman Peninsula</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 2nd: The Soviet army launched a major offensive southeast of Chai Puluqi in recent days but was repelled. Due to the electric shock of the moon, only small-scale attacks were made on the 1st. The Soviet army is still launching offensives in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, attempting to seize bridgeheads.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 2nd: The German Supreme Headquarters issued a bulletin at noon on Sunday, stating: The enemy army carried out partial offensives on Saturday in the Kupen bridgehead and the southern and central parts of the eastern front. After fierce fighting in several strongholds, the enemy army was repelled. After destroying all important military equipment, the German army withdrew from the town of Taman, without being noticed by the enemy at the time.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a Huitong News Agency report, well-informed sources in the German military declared last night that the Soviet army continued to exert pressure on the German army in the Gomel area of the central route of the eastern front. Despite the extremely bad weather, the Soviet army still dispatched large numbers of tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc. to fight, attempting to attack the flanks of the German rearguard, but ultimately failed. At the same time, the Soviet army applied heavy pressure to the German positions along the Smolensk Highway and launched several offensives, all of which were repelled by our defending troops. The enemy army once broke into the German positions at a certain point, but was counterattacked and repelled. The German army launched an attack north of the highway and made considerable progress. The German air force also assisted in the battle south of Smolensk, bombing the enemy's temporary airfield near Dimituofu, north of Smolensk, and destroying all the equipment.

<h3>France Recovers Lost Territory from Italy</h3>

<h3>German Troops in Eastern Italy Adopt Mobile Tactics: German Troops Retreat North of Naples and Defend the Highlands</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a Huitong News Agency report: The German withdrawal from Naples was a pre-planned plan by the German Command. Currently, German troops are using artillery to control the military operations of the plains in the foothills of the Apennines. Small units of enemy troops advancing between Vesuvius and the Apennines are immediately stopped. The right wing of the US Fifth Army's thrust towards Benevento also encountered significant difficulties. Only small units of the British Eighth Army have advanced to the foothills of Puglia, where there are intense local battles. However, the enemy army has no room for maneuver in southern Italy, because塞林 avoids large-scale battles and continues to advance north. When this evasive action will stop, the German Command is temporarily keeping it a secret, and the Allied forces are very anxious about this issue.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: According to a German News Agency report: The German military operations in the Naples area were not interfered with by the British and American forces. Sometimes enemy troops, under the cover of tanks, attempted to obstruct the German army's actions, but were repelled as a result. Several villages near Mount Vesuvius and the town of Ottaviano have been completely evacuated, and the German army has retreated to well-prepared and shortened positions. There is no news of war in the vicinity of the new front line, except for reconnaissance activities. The war activity in the eastern part of the southern Italian front in the Castelnuovo區 (Castelnuovo area塞拉加浦奥拉區 (Serracaqhriola) area has greatly increased. General 蒙高茂萊's troops, under the cover of tanks, attempted to break through the German front line, but the German army's mobile tactics were enough to resist all large-scale attacks. At that time, thirteen enemy "Xu Men" tanks were damaged and unable to move, and sixteen armored vehicles were destroyed or caught fire. The British artillery units protecting the battle were unable to break through the German resistance. After General 蒙高茂萊's attempt to break through failed, he stopped the offensive. Near Castelnuovo, British troops attempted to encircle the German rearguard, but were attacked by neighboring German detachments. The battle is still in progress.</p>

<h3>Canadian Destroyer Sunk by Submarine: Almost No Survivors Among the Crew</h3>

According to a Reuters report, only one member of the ship's crew survived, and the remaining 146 people were buried at sea.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Gusev, Takes Office</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Amsterdam, 3rd: According to news from London: The new Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Gusev, arrived in London on Saturday. Gusev was formerly the Soviet Minister to Canada.</p>
<h3>Berlin Denies German-Soviet Understanding</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 3rd: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry yesterday strongly denied reports from British, American, and Soviet sources that there was a possibility of a German-Soviet understanding. The spokesman told foreign reporters that the Soviet government's motives for spreading this rumor were roughly threefold: First, to make people think that the Soviet Union's position is now extremely strong, so Germany is preparing to compromise with Moscow. Second, to make the anti-Axis countries worry about Germany and the Soviet Union making peace separately, thereby forcing the anti-Axis countries to step up their military operations on the second front. Third, to make the anti-Axis countries more willing to accept the Soviet Union's political demands. On the other hand, the UK also has its reasons for spreading this rumor, which can be used as an excuse to make its further concessions to the Soviet Union seem justified. The spokesman pointed out that regarding this matter, the Swedish newspaper 　 also has the same view as the canal, and 　 the truth has been stated in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's recent speech.</p>
<h3>U Set Succeeds as Burmese Finance Minister</h3>

<h3>Wartime Soviet Diplomacy: Analysis of Soviet War Power, Part 3 (2)</h3>
<p>Discord Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The discord between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union has been a recurring problem since the start of the German-Soviet war. Especially during each British-American summit, although the anti-Axis camp had high expectations, Stalin never participated, thus repeatedly becoming the subject of discussion.</p>
<p>It would naturally be a misguided and very dangerous view to overestimate the antagonism between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Taking the start of the German-Soviet war as an opportunity, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States united on the point of carrying out the war against Germany. But although they are united, they are still somewhat distant.</p>
<p>In extremely formulaic terms, the Soviet Union is a socialist country, and its ultimate goal is not only to complete communism in one country, but also to make the world red. Even if it is currently preoccupied with the German-Soviet war and concentrates all its national power on promoting the war against Germany, Stalin will not forget this matter in his dreams—making the world red.</p>
<p>Conversely, the United Kingdom and the United States are typical imperialist countries, and their ultimate goal is to dominate the world through imperialism. This world war was triggered by the imperialist ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom and the United States fear Germany, which is moving towards building a new order in Europe, but they fear the Bolshevik doctrine of the Soviet Union even more.</p>
<p>Because the fundamentally incompatible Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States are united on the point of carrying out the war against Germany, they naturally want to take advantage of each other to make their own position advantageous. It is also natural for dramatic 　 to arise in the interests of the three countries with conflicting interests.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States, 腼, and the future situation may even provoke armed conflict. In this regard, what the Soviet Union hopes for is to demand the opening of a second front, while what the United Kingdom and the United States hope for is the prolongation of the German-Soviet war. That is, the Soviet Union is unwilling to resist Germany with its own strength alone, 　 　 war power, but wants the United Kingdom and the United States to open a second front, saving its own war power and, at the same time, wanting to offset the war power of the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States are delaying the opening of the second front within the possible range, prolonging the German-Soviet war, in order to save the war power of their own troops and consume the war power of the German and Soviet armies, hoping that the German and Soviet countries will suffer heavy losses if possible. But the problem is not that simple.</p>
<p>First, as a result of the re-evaluation of the Red Army's war power, the United Kingdom and the United States are clearly far behind. If they completely lose their existing rights and interests in Europe, it will be extremely difficult to realize their imperialist ambitions in Europe. But if the second front is opened based on the above reasons, then the purpose of reducing the Soviet Union's war power cannot be achieved, and the United Kingdom and the United States are caught in a painful vise.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the 加　勃期加 talks in January of this year, no conclusion could be reached on the question of how to deal with the second war, and opinions were not consistent at the Washington talks in May of this year either. Soon the battle of Sicily came to an end, and how to deal with the second front became an increasingly pressing issue, to the point of this Quebec conference, but if the above-mentioned complicated situation is not eliminated, then the United Kingdom and the United States will ultimately be unable to reach a conclusion on the second front issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also a difficult-to-overcome divide between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the issue of Germany. The United Kingdom and the United States say on the surface that the purpose of the war against Germany is to overthrow the Nazi regime, but secretly they are attempting to implement imperialist all-encompassing distribution of the German people.</p>
<p>In response, the Soviet Union intends to handle it with its own views. This opposition can also be seen in the attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union towards the Italian policy.</p>
<p>That is, at this Quebec conference, although the British and American public opinion circles hoped that Stalin would participate before the meeting was held, not to mention Stalin, not even one representative of the Soviet Union participated, and the Soviet government issued an extremely rate-producing statement through TASS on August 12, saying:</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union was not invited to the talks. In terms of the nature of the talks, there was no need for a representative of the Soviet Union to participate, so they did not participate."</p>
<p>Despite this, Roosevelt and Churchill 　 然 hoped that Stalin would participate. After the talks came to an end, it was reported that the American side's Hull　Wells and the British side's Churchill and Eden would visit Moscow.</p>
<p>Why did TASS issue a statement that was not only extremely inappropriate from a diplomatic point of view, but also unnecessary? Although there can be various explanations for this, in any case, we have again recognized the misalignment of the pace of the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned discord between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will inevitably intensify as the war situation progresses. How the Soviet Union will handle this issue and carry out the war against Germany is an extremely interesting question. (End of the full text: Xiang　from Allied World Returns One Two Two Three)</p>

<h3>Gauze Factory Registration Discrepancies: Forty-One Factories Sealed Up: Awaiting Instructions from the Authorities for Disposition</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Personnel designated by the 物資調查委員會's Sino-Japanese relevant agencies, serving as investigators in the council, led investigators to investigate the gauze and cloth stored in public and private warehouses in the city in compliance with orders. Now they are continuing to investigate whether the gauze and cloth stored in various knitting factories, dyeing and weaving factories, and gauze and cloth businesses have been registered, and applying to the 商統會's office for the purchase and sale of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The work is very tense. The investigation tasks are strictly carried out, and there will be no leniency based on personal connections. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry, the council investigated a total of 1,297 Sino-Japanese warehouses, yarn factories, yarn shops, cloth factories, cloth shops, and knitting factories in the city from July 13 to September 15 of this year. Among them, the amount of gauze and cloth stored in forty-one factories either did not match the registered amount, or was not registered at all, or no one was contacted, making it impossible to investigate. Approval has been obtained to seal them up and await disposal.</p>
<h3>Food Control Commission to Implement Rice Purchase This Week: Purchase Funds Completely Resolved: Reserve Bank Agrees to Handle Rediscounting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: After the internal weaving mechanism and rice purchase plan of the Rice and Grain Control Committee were completely determined, they all started working on the first day of this month. The registration of the preparatory committee members of the rice purchase industry association in various regions has also ended. The review started yesterday. After the review is completed, it will be entrusted with selling rice, and the rice purchase will be carried out according to the established rice purchase price and quantity steps. As for the issue of purchase funds, it will be advanced by the relevant government financial institutions. The Central Reserve Bank agrees to bear the responsibility for rediscounting bills. Therefore, the issue of rice purchase and funds has been completely resolved, and the actual work of rice purchase can begin this week. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the council, if the rice purchase plan formulated by the council this time can be carried out smoothly according to the established plan, or there are no other inconveniences, the goal of balancing the people's food and not lacking anywhere can be achieved. However, this kind of wish cannot be achieved by the sole power of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, and it still requires the cooperation of all relevant parties.</p>

<h3>Salt Rationing to be Implemented Pending Ministry of Finance Approval</h3>
<p>Shanghai's salt supply is steadily arriving from production areas, with no shortage. Shipments are being further expedited to ensure an even more abundant supply. The authorities are currently planning for rationing. However, salt is a state-operated business, and salt affairs regulations are comprehensive and well-defined, unlike ordinary commodities such as rice, flour, oil, and sugar. The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration is responsible for salt affairs and handles everything in accordance with salt laws. Any matter that should be initiated or reformed but lacks a legal basis, no matter how big or small, must first be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented. Previously, the Economic Department of the First District Public Office of this city sent a letter to the bureau outlining the implementation of salt rationing. The bureau considered the matter significant and requires the Ministry of Finance to approve concrete and thorough measures to ensure that salt affairs administration is not obstructed. Therefore, salt rationing in this city will be implemented pending approval from the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Health is the Dawn That Bears a Deep Relationship to the Nation and is the Foundation of a Person's Career</h3>
<p>Health is the foundation of all human endeavors. A strong nation and a healthy society cannot be built on a weak and sickly population. This is an irrefutable fact. Dr. Takata Yasuma, Director of the Japanese National Research Institute, once said, "If a nation desires to overcome poverty and hardship, it must possess a strong body and mind. This is the driving force for the nation's eternal survival and development." These unbreakable words can deepen our understanding of the profound relationship between national health and national survival. Therefore, we feel that how to improve national health is a very important issue. At the same time, we feel that the health movement that has emerged in recent years is the only answer to this important question.</p>
<h3>History of Healthcare</h3>
<p>Speaking of healthcare, countries around the world have long been pioneers and have reaped great benefits. Their success can be said to be entirely due to the establishment of a disease insurance system. This disease insurance system originated in 1871, and Dr. Baylor of Baylor University in the United States was the first to successfully try it. In 1929, the doctor insured 1,250 school teachers, with a premium of only five cents per person per month. The success of the experiment attracted great attention from the general public. In 1935, Miss Harlene Hoess of New York City, together with several apartment staff members, started this business. Within a year, the total number of members reached 84,000, and the number of new members joining each month was about 5,000. The progress was rapid. On the one hand, this was because the disease insurance system was urgently needed by the people, and on the other hand, it was due to the general public's deep understanding of the significance of healthcare. This is why it was able to attract their enthusiastic support. This is an inevitable trend of cause and effect. Now, this disease insurance system is becoming more and more complete. In terms of organization, there are public and private distinctions. The former is compulsory, and all employees of shops and factories, as well as general civil servants, are forced to insure. The insurance premium is borne by the authorities of the service institution for one-third and by the insured for two-thirds. This insurance premium is about 4% to 7% of the employee's monthly salary. There are designated doctors and hospitals that serve the insured all year round. The latter is completely different from the former. All housewives and children, as well as general freelancers, can freely join private disease insurance organizations. There are no restrictions on seeing a doctor or being hospitalized, and the expenses can be recovered from the insurance organization after the fact.</p>
<h3>Beneficiaries Precedent</h3>
<p>The people of various countries who have benefited from the disease insurance system are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Now, let us cite one or two examples to summarize the rest. In the United States, there was an old man of 57 in New York. In the beginning, someone persuaded him to join the association, but the old man was very opposed to it. However, three weeks after joining the association, he was sent to the hospital due to severe pneumonia. When he recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the cost on the hospital bill was only $2.60. He was really surprised and could not help but sing praises. There was also an unemployed friend who fell and was seriously injured. After being sent to the hospital, he was treated with X-rays and medication. He was hospitalized for about a week, recovered and was discharged from the hospital without paying a penny. There are countless people who have benefited like this.</p>
<h3>Environmental Needs</h3>
<p>In this great era, the issue of health is the most important. On the one hand, due to rising living costs and difficulty in obtaining food and clothing, how to shoulder the burden of life is a major issue that most people are looking forward to. On the other hand, the country is embarking on a new path of restoration and construction. Everything requires the cooperation of the people. As a member of the people, how can we not fail the expectations of the country and assume the responsibilities that everyone should bear? This is a big problem. To sum it up, these two heavy burdens placed before us cannot be borne by weak and sickly people. There is absolutely no doubt about this. Therefore, in this great era, people cannot but pay attention to health for their own survival, and they must pay even more attention to health for the survival of the country. In addition, from the perspective of social and economic conditions alone, due to the high cost of medicine now, most people cannot afford to see a doctor. The impact of this on public health and social productivity cannot be said to be small. Under the above-mentioned circumstances, we feel that it is urgently needed by the environment to vigorously implement healthcare to improve national health. In the minds of the general public, it may be like waiting for clouds in a severe drought.</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Healthcare</h3>
<p>The importance of healthcare has been described above, and we believe that healthcare work is not only in the area of medical treatment. Because after a person becomes ill, he or she starts to seek medical relief. Even if the treatment is appropriate and he or she can recover his or her health early, he or she will inevitably suffer considerable losses in terms of economic time, spirit, and work. Therefore, preventing trouble before it happens is better than mending it afterwards. The real healthcare work lies in promoting all disease prevention work. This is the true meaning of health, and it is the shortcut to improving national health.</p>
<p>The Chinese Healthcare Association is a new healthcare organization that has been established under the ardent hope of society and with the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. In order to adapt to the urgent needs of society, and with reference to the healthcare systems of various countries, the Guidance and Service Departments were established first. Now, the association is soliciting members from the public in order to provide ordinary services to the society, and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically joining.</p>

<h3>Purchasing Wheat to Produce Flour, Public Agreement on Collection and Distribution Signed, Violators Will Have Their Qualifications Revoked and Be Punished</h3>
<p>After the Wheat and Flour Professional Committee unified the purchase of wheat from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as Shanghai and Nanjing cities, and with the efforts of bank loans, the committee stipulated that all entrusted merchants collecting wheat and flour mills distributing wheat must sign a public agreement. The agreement is excerpted below:</p>
<h3>Public Agreement for Entrusted Merchants to Collect Wheat</h3>
<p>"I am willing to follow the general strategy of the National Commercial Control General Association for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat, and apply for the business of buying wheat. In addition to selling the collected wheat directly to the entrusted flour mills in accordance with the distribution quota stipulated by your committee, if there is a surplus, I will listen to your committee's purchase at the given price and abide by all regulations of your committee regarding the purchase of wheat. If there is a serious violation, I am willing to accept severe punishment."</p>
<h3>Public Agreement for Flour Mills to Distribute Wheat</h3>
<p>"I am willing to follow the general strategy of the National Commercial Control General Association for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat and apply for the manufacture of flour from wheat. I will absolutely abide by all the regulations of the committee regarding the collection and distribution of flour and wheat, as well as the following clauses. If there is a violation, I am willing to accept the revocation of registration qualifications and severe punishment. The purchased wheat must absolutely comply with the stipulated distribution quota and must not exceed the quota. The purchased wheat must be handled by the entrusted merchants registered with the responsible committee. The purchased wheat must never be resold. If the total amount of wheat purchased is insufficient, I will allow your committee to collect it at the officially set price in accordance with the original distribution ratio and will never sell it elsewhere."</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices in this City Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>In recent months, commodity prices in various industries in this city have gradually stabilized due to the authorities' efforts to adjust and improve them reasonably. In particular, since the government purchased cotton yarn and cloth, most of the floating capital has been absorbed. However, speculators tried to make a final struggle, but they were discovered by the relevant personnel and punished according to the law, resulting in several cases of suspension of business for several days or fines. As for the construction of various cloth markets, due to the authorities' rapid expansion of the control system, most hoarders were extremely anxious and eagerly sought to release their stockpiles. Shops in various industries also sold off goods to obtain cash, and the phenomenon of large price reductions and special sales also competed to sell off goods. Therefore, commodity prices have naturally become more reasonable. The financial market situation in Shanghai is still as calm , with no changes in the market prices of Chiwen silver, military tickets, joint banknotes, and interbank lending rates. Government bonds and stocks were once weak due to unfounded rumors in the market, but they soon returned to normal. Currently, stock trading is still the most active , and with the Central Reserve Bank's efforts to regulate funds, the money supply has become looser. Food rice is becoming more stable due to the active preparations for purchase by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, and the market price is low and flat. Market prices of other miscellaneous grains, beans, and wheat have also decreased. The publicly set prices of daily food items are stable and unchanged, and the trend of rising prices in the black market has completely stopped. The entire industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai is more stable than before.</p>
<h3>Black Dates and Dried Lychees are Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>The first batch of new black dates have appeared in small quantities in this city and Nanjing. Due to the poor harvest, the quality of the goods is relatively poor, but the price is slightly higher than that of the old goods. As for the old goods stored for a long time, the interest and warehouse rent have also increased significantly, so the market is also expected to tighten.</p>
<p>Due to the poor production and difficult sourcing of Jinshan column incense this year, prices have risen again according to recent telegraphic information. As a result, the price in City A has also risen. The number of glutinous rice branches is even smaller, and the degree of increase is higher.</p>
<p>The arrival of rice substitutes is lacking, but actual sales are still slow, so in addition to slight trading among peers, inquiries from customers are also rare, resulting in a very soft market situation.</p>

<h3>Chinese Dominance in Tennis, French and Portuguese Annihilated in International Competition, Japan Defeated by 1-2 in Championship Game (Honghu)</h3>
<p>This international charity tennis tournament, with four strong teams from China, Japan, France, and Portugal participating, began on the preceding Saturday (September 25). The preliminary round schedule was determined by the organizing authorities. Japan faced France on the opening day, and China faced Portugal the following day (September 26). The competition used an elimination system with two singles matches and one doubles match. The preliminary round results showed that Japan and China each won 3-0, eliminating France and Portugal respectively, and both qualified for the final. After a week of rest, the two giants, China and Japan, held a fierce battle at the same location the day before (October 2). China had outstanding singles players, winning two groups, and Japan had excellent doubles cooperation, also winning. As a result, China defeated the Japanese team to win the championship. Japan narrowly lost and finished as runner-up. From then on, in the national tennis world, China took the lead and became the leader. In the sports history of Shanghai, the Chinese have added another glorious and brilliant page. The competition began after Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary Zhao, delivered the opening remarks, and Mayor Chen personally presided over the awards ceremony and closing ceremony. Over the past three days, Minister Chu, Minister Ding, the French Consul General, the Portuguese Consul General, and Chairman Shen Siliang of the Municipal Sports Association have all attended the matches. However, the level of tennis was high, and the audience was not enthusiastic during the first two days of the preliminary round. The final was sold out. This still needs promoters to promote its popularity. Under the leadership and supervision of Chairman Pan of the Three Provinces Sports Association, the arrangement of the tennis court was orderly. The ticket sales were also considerable due to the efforts of Chairman Pan of the Three Provinces, which will help the charitable organizations in China, Japan, France, and Portugal, which is not insignificant. The benevolence and righteousness are not only in the sports field.</p>
<h3>Japan Eliminates France</h3>
<p>In the Japan-France match, Japan's Kanda Michio faced France's Courenzeff in the second singles match. Kanda, experienced and steady, remained calm and unhurried, which was his strength. Courenzeff, on the other hand, was young and impetuous, with powerful forehand shots and sharp serves, but his backhand was extremely weak, becoming a point of attack for his opponent. Courenzeff won the first game with his serve, but Kanda returned the favor, making it one game each. After Courenzeff won another game, Kanda quickly took it back. Courenzeff kept losing and gaining, becoming visibly flustered. Kanda seized the opportunity and made it 4-2, eventually winning the first set 6-3. In the second set, Kanda scored twice with his serve, while Courenzeff's serve failed, leading to three consecutive lost games. At this point, Courenzeff seemed to wake up from a dream and tried to stay calm, using high-speed hitting, forcing Kanda to run around, and winning six consecutive games, leaving Kanda in the shadows, losing the set 3-6. In the third set, Courenzeff, having exerted too much effort in the previous set, showed weaknesses again. Kanda, like a whirlwind, won a set easily. In the end, Japan won 2-1. In the doubles match, Japan's Yamagishi Seiichi and Fukushi Sanya faced France's Jourdan and Bruns. The strengths of both sides were almost equal. The closeness of the score shows the intensity of the competition. Yamagishi was more steady than Fukushi, while Jourdan was more powerful than Bruns. The French team's defeat was due to more errors and self-inflicted mistakes. Bruns' serve was broken, and Yamagishi took the second game. Suddenly, Jourdan and Bruns took the lead 3-2, but then Yamagishi and Fukushi led 4-3. The situation was extremely unpredictable. Jourdan and Bruns then created a 5-4 advantage, but Yamagishi and Fukushi eventually won 7-5. In the second set, both Bruns and Yamagishi failed their serves, making it one each. Then the French side took the lead twice. The Japanese side won three consecutive games, making it 5-3. The French side returned the favor, making it 6-5, but they failed to capitalize. The Japanese side saw the opportunity and regained their advantage, eventually winning 8-6. As a result, Japan won in straight sets. Japan also won the final singles match, with Japan's Maba facing France's Avigue. Maba had unique skills in both forehand and backhand, while Avigue, despite being France's main player, paled in comparison. Avigue won the first game with his serve, but Maba then won five consecutive games. Avigue resisted stubbornly, bringing the score close to 4-5, but eventually lost the set 4-6. In the second set, Maba broke his opponent's serve, and Avigue immediately won three consecutive games in return. However, this did not dampen Maba's momentum. Maba then won five consecutive games in one go, ending the second set 6-3. Japan won by a net two games. The overall result was 3-0, with Japan eliminating France.</p>
<h3>China Easily Defeats Portugal</h3>
<p>The China-Portugal match was held the day after the Japan-France match. The scorching sun was even more intense than in mid-summer. This was an unusual weather for after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The match started at 2:30 PM, right under the scorching sun. Players who played in the match would inevitably sweat profusely and feel dizzy. Fortunately, the strength of the two sides was vastly different. The Chinese team's victory was as easy as turning over their hands, so they did not exert much effort. Otherwise, in such harsh weather, it would have been difficult for the players' bodies to avoid being affected. In the second singles match, China's Zhang Dingzhao faced Portugal's Rocha Liao. Zhang Dingzhao was a veteran of the Chinese team. Although his skills were not at their peak, his unwavering spirit was unmatched by ordinary players. Moreover, he was able to maintain his normal state. Therefore, even at his age, he could still compete with top players. Rocha was a rising star, and together with his teammate Soares, was considered to have great potential, but he lacked experience and his skills were not yet refined. When he met Zhang, the outcome was obvious. After Rocha won the first game with his serve, Zhang immediately won three consecutive games. Rocha won the fifth game with his serve, and then took a 5-2 lead. Then it became 5-3. Zhang finally missed a set point, but still won easily 6-3. In the second set, the situation was one-sided. Zhang controlled the game freely, doing whatever he wanted. Rocha lost six consecutive games. As a result, China won 2-0. In the doubles match, China's Liang Deguang and Cai Guoji faced Portugal's Sunner and Soares. Among the four players, Liang and Sunner both had considerable experience, but Sunner did not perform as well as he should have. Soares was not skilled enough and was too impetuous, while Cai was talented but prone to panic. Although Sunner and Soares attacked Cai Guoji's weaknesses, they failed to capitalize, leading to their defeat. Liang and Soares each won a game with their serve. Liang and Cai then took a 4-1 and 5-2 lead, eventually winning 6-3. In the second set, Soares won the opening serve, but Liang evened it out. After Portugal made it 2-1, the Chinese team won four consecutive games. There was a fierce battle in the fifth game, with both sides missing several game points. This set also went to the Chinese team with the score remaining 6-1. As a result, China won 2-0. Next, in the final singles match, China's Tao Guanqiu faced Portugal's Carvalho. Carvalho was not weak in technique due to his father's influence, but compared to Guanqiu, he was still inexperienced. However, his style showed the potential of a great player, only needing diligent practice. The score was 6-2 and 6-1. Carvalho only won the first and fourth games of the first set and the fourth game of the second set. The powerful shots of both players were admirable. Tao was praised, and Carvalho also received good reviews. It was a wonderful match. The overall result was China defeating Portugal 3-0.</p>
<h3>Championship Finals Process</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese teams both qualified for the championship finals, which were held on the day before yesterday (October 2nd). After being washed by a rain shower, the court was even more beautiful. The autumn sun was not strong, but the wind was a bit strong. Overall, it was a good day. In the second singles match, China still sent Zhang Dingzhao, while Japan replaced Kanda with Isobe Kameo.</p>
<p>Isobe was as steady as Kanda, but his smashes were even more powerful. He was especially confident with his backhand. Zhang's defense failed, and he lost three consecutive games. Then, he quickly caught up, tying the score at 3-3. Isobe then took the lead again twice, making it 4-3 and 5-4, putting Zhang in a dangerous situation. However, Zhang did not lose heart and won two games to tie the score again. In the twelfth game, Isobe missed two game points, losing the opportunity to make it 6-6. Zhang then won 7-5, breaking the tie and winning the set. In the second set, the situation changed dramatically. Zhang had a clear advantage. Isobe was exhausted and struggled to defend, losing his ability to counterattack. Zhang won the first two games, but Isobe broke his serve in the third game, making it 2-1. Isobe still showed no improvement and lost three more games. Zhang finally won again with 6-2. There were three deuce games in this set, with Zhang winning two and Isobe winning one. As a result, China won 2-0. In the doubles match, China's Zhou Guanjun and Cai Guoheng faced Japan's Yamagishi Seiichi and Fukushi Saburo. Doubles was the only weakness of the Chinese team, and Zhou and Cai played even worse than expected, especially Zhou. In international competitions related to national honor, victory or defeat is a common occurrence, but choosing Zhou as a representative shows the selection committee’s negligence. The skills of Yamagishi and Fukushi were not top-notch either. In the first set, the Chinese team suffered a crushing defeat of 6-0. In the second set, Zhou and Cai finally improved slightly. After Japan won two consecutive games, they tied the score twice at 2-2 and 3-3. In the seventh game, Cai and Zhou made mistakes and missed game points, failing to catch up. Fukushi missed a match point, but Japan eventually won 6-3. As a result, the Chinese team was defeated 2-0. The final singles match was the deciding point, a matter of life and death. China's Tao Guanqiu and Japan's Maba Shigeru then started their match. The Chinese audience cheered for Guanqiu. Guanqiu lived up to expectations, easily defeating his opponent and allowing Mayor Chen's championship trophy to be brought back to the Chinese team. Tao's skills were high, and even Maba had to admit defeat. Guanqiu won the first set without much effort. After Maba won a game with his serve, he lost two more games. Tao then won with 6-1. In the second set, Tao was unstoppable, winning five consecutive games. Then, he showed mercy, allowing his opponent to avoid a shutout, and won again with 6-2. As a result, he won in straight sets 2-0. The overall result was China winning the championship with 2-1, while Japan ranked second.</p>
<h3>General Assessment of the Strengths of the Four Teams</h3>
<p>Looking at the overall strengths of the four teams, the Chinese team's singles players can be described as invincible. Tao Guanqiu was born into the profession. He had sparred with the world champion Tilton Barnes (Tilton had come to Shanghai to perform), and his skills had indeed reached the realm of perfection. Even when competing with Carson, who had dominated the entire event before, he did not concede much, except that he was not seen volleying. He defeated Carvalho and Maba without much effort, and Avigue was even less of a challenge. He was the Shanghai champion and was definitely worthy of his title. Zhang Dingzhao's heroic spirit remained, and he could be described as invincible in the second singles. He was seven parts sure to be able to beat Avigue who had competed with the first singles player Carvalho. The doubles pairing of Liang and Cai was superior to Zhou and Cai, but still not a match for the Japanese team. They were similar to Jourdan and Bruns. Maba Shigeru of the Japanese team could be ranked second among all the singles players in the competition. Isobe was better than Kanda, and in the second singles, he could be ranked first, second only to Dingzhao. With Yamagishi and Fushi, while Shanghai lacked doubles talent at the time, they rightfully revealed their silvery edge. If the doubles had not been held so early, then our Tao and Liang pairing, or Wang Wenzheng, would have had a chance of success against them. The Portuguese team had Carvalho as their strongest player. Whether Nicolai Kranshar chose to conceal his skill or not was unknown, but if Carvalho played cautiously, Maba would be sure to be able to win. Rocha Liao had not yet demonstrated his true level. He was like Liao Hua, a minor character in the Three Kingdoms. The doubles pairing of Sunner and Soares was even weaker than Jourdan and Bruns. They were the weakest of the four teams. Avigue of the French team was not a top-tier player, and Couronzeff was even less impressive. The doubles pairing of Jourdan and Bruns could pose a threat, but not much. In summary, the Chinese team deserved to win the championship, and the Japanese team's second-place finish was also reasonable. If France and Portugal were to compete, it was expected that France would win the doubles. The first singles would belong to Portugal, and the French team was likely to win the second singles.</p>
<p>The above discussion is based on the performance of the players who have participated in the past three days. It is difficult to make predictions about those who have not yet played, so this competition cannot be used to determine the rankings of all Shanghai tennis players. In the entire competition, only one match was decided in three sets. The rest were concluded in straight sets. However, the players were already showing signs of fatigue. Compared to the exciting five-set matches of the past, this was not the same. This shows that in an era of a lack of tennis courts, players lack opportunities to practice, which affects their physical strength and the improvement of their skills. If we want to improve the level of tennis, isn't it difficult?</p>
<h3>Tidbits from the Sports Scene</h3>
<p>The psychology of spectators at any ball game is extremely cruel. If a ball is won, the whole stadium cheers and praises. If a ball is lost, there is a loud boo. They are sent to the 18th level of hell. The change from honor to disgrace takes less than a minute. This kind of expression is enough to affect the players' fighting psychology. There was such a phenomenon at the International Tennis Tournament the other day.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Sports Field held a fundraising basketball game last week. Four teams from Shanghai, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi were invited to participate in the competition, bringing together the elite from four regions in one event. This was truly an unprecedented event in Wuxi. Shanghai was represented by the "Yu Ren" team, the champion of both the junior and senior basketball leagues. As a result, "Nani" of Wuxi defeated "Yu Ren" by six points, winning the championship.</p>
<p>The skills of the Huaying basketball team have recently improved rapidly. In the Jianbei Cup, they unexpectedly defeated the strong Tongren team. This is truly commendable. It is said that on Double Tenth Day, they have accepted an invitation from the Xichang team of Wuxi to compete in Wuxi.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Huaying women's basketball team is truly a glorious record in Chinese film history. In the past, famous actresses such as Hu Die and Ruan Lingyu, although their acting skills were superb and they were admired by everyone, they inevitably had shortcomings in terms of athleticism. Therefore, the creation of this team is of great value. It is said that Qian Xuzhi, the coach of the Huaying men's basketball team, will also serve as the coach of the women's team. Since taking office, he has been instructing the team. Recently, Li Qinghua, You Hua, Hu Feng, and others have expressed great excitement and are about to "cut their fingernails and put on running shoes" to compete with the heroes of this city.

<p>The Shanghai Small Ball League, co-sponsored by Xin Kai Bao and the Municipal Sports Association, was joined by 96 teams. After a competition lasting four months, it has now successfully concluded. The awards ceremony was held on the seventh floor of the Jincheng Bank the other day. More than 100 people attended. Wu Yun, the chairman of the Xinwen Bao, presided over the ceremony. Shen Silang, Zhou Jiaqi, Wang Fang and others delivered speeches and presented the awards. Photographs were taken.</p>
<p>Jiang Bingquan, the director of the Nanshi District Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Bureau of Finance, in order to promote sports, selected team members from among all the employees. A small football team was formed first. Welcome to make an appointment for a competition. The address for communication is: Quan Zhensheng, No. 60 Xicang Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Coral Sea Blitzkrieg: Enemy Aircraft Carrier Sunk</h3>
<p>May 4th, 00:00 AM, "Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered!" The telegram broke the silence. The ○○ Attack Force immediately prepared to attack, anxiously awaiting the order to depart. However, the departure order never came. Instead, the order was to stand by. The enemy escaped the action area of our blitzkrieg force. We, who were full of confidence in victory, were very disappointed. Each time the enemy mobile unit appeared, they would immediately flee upon seeing us. This greatly displeased us.</p>
<h3>Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered</h3>
<p>However, at 00:00 AM on May 6th, we received another message: "Enemy Mobile Unit Discovered!" The enemy was lurking there, surely with some intention! We cannot but decisively destroy this enemy.</p>
<p>"Ah! The enemy mobile unit is out!"</p>
<p>"Good! We won't let them escape this time!"</p>
<p>"They're coming out so boldly; it must be their death day!"</p>
<p>My comrades were already predicting that victory belonged to us.</p>
<p>"Aircraft ○ Team, assemble!" This order was received in all the rooms.</p>
<p>"The order is down. Are we preparing to attack?"</p>
<p>That question was on everyone's energetic face.</p>
<p>In groups of three or four, their faces excited, they were talking about the mobile unit.</p>
<p>"It seems to be a very large force!"</p>
<p>"The telegram from the aircraft said that there are four battleships, one or two aircraft carriers, ten cruisers, and more than ten destroyers!"</p>
<p>"Goodness, the entire Pacific Fleet is here!"</p>
<p>"Never mind. The four battleships and two aircraft carriers are the most important. Let's sink them first."</p>
<p>Among us, without a word, we knew that the battle was gradually maturing, and the decisive battle was about to begin. That decisive battle will be carried out by our hands.</p>
<p>"Each squad, line up!"</p>
<p>We learned the details of the enemy's situation from the pilots. The situation of the battle. We were ready for the surprise attack, but waited and waited for the order, which finally came down. The arrow left the string. The airfield immediately turned into a busy battlefield.</p>
<p>Those transporting torpedoes, those preparing to launch angles, those loading fuel, those maintaining the engines, each person, according to their assigned work, with bloodshot eyes, used skilled methods to run back and forth and work.</p>
<p>The torpedoes were brought in. The souls of the torpedo crew were entrusted to the torpedoes. Under the thin layer of paint, they faintly and sharply emitted the luster of precision. One glance was enough to know how much power they contained! Once launched, they were bound to hit. No matter how strong the giant ship, it would be shattered in one hit. The torpedo crew was praying:</p>
<p>"How can we launch it to hit the target?"</p>
<p>For this, they forgot about eating and sleeping, focusing their entire nervous system on maintaining the torpedoes.</p>
<p>And we were also praying: "How can we hit the target?" So, we stroked the head of the torpedo like stroking the heads of children.</p>
<p>The location was bad, and unlike the units in the homeland, everything was at hand. Eating and drinking were hasty. The comrades overcame all the adverse conditions with their mental strength and gradually equipped themselves.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking towards the western horizon, and in the twilight, a glimpse of bright sky still clung to it, unwilling to leave. The surrounding scenery soon changed completely. The night covered the sea. Quietly, the sound of insects could be heard from there. However, in a battlefield under a blackout, bright lights could not be lit. We could only work under dim electric lights. Thus, in the darkness, one after another, preparations were quickly completed.</p>
<p>"It's finished now. It's very reliable!"</p>
<p>All obstacles were completely overcome by my comrades. After that, there was only the waiting for the order to depart. The faces of the comrades, after finishing their hard work, reflected joy.</p>
<p>In the sky, before it was completely dark, I had prepared the engine in its entirety. "Now it's good. No matter how we fly! We can rest assured." Fuel and torpedoes had also been loaded. The battle preparations for my beloved aircraft were completely completed.</p>
<p>Late at night. Countless fireflies. Aircraft intertwined. Flickering on and off. Under the bright shining of the Southern Cross, I felt the sweat-soaked skin on my back and the night wind blowing in gusts. In my heart, I was thinking that if I could take a bath before participating in the great naval battle, my spirit would be even better; however, when I thought about the inconvenient battlefield, where there was not even a sip of water to drink, I could only lie down with my clothes on, ready for the order to come at any time.</p>
<p>The duty non-commissioned officer announced the schedule for tomorrow. "Scouting aircraft ○, depart at ○:○○!"</p>
<p>"Assault team, line up at ○:○○! Everyone, wake up at four o'clock!"</p>
<p>Tomorrow we would fight to the death with the American fleet representing 100 million people. We held great expectations, praying silently:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow we must find a way to meet the American fleet!"...</p>
<p>After the blood of the sea eagles burning with the spirit of battle boiled, it was not easy to calm them down. I reluctantly lay down in anxiety. The thought of the battle tomorrow made me too excited to sleep soundly. I could only count one, two, three, four... I fell asleep unconsciously.</p>
<h3>Morning of Departure</h3>
<p>Dawn broke, May 7th, 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>"Everyone, wake up!"</p>
<p>I kicked off the blanket and jumped up.</p>
<p>In the southern country's morning, the sky was not yet bright. The bright moon still hung in the sky. Countless stars were twinkling. The autumn breeze was blowing, and the air was very fresh. I stretched out my hands, stretched, and took a breath of fresh air. In the homeland, spring had not completely passed yet! But here, winter would soon be here.</p>
<p>The aircraft was covered with morning mist, lying there quietly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of the engine turning broke the silence of dawn and roared.</p>
<p>I ran to the side of the aircraft. I started the motor and turned the engine.</p>
<p>Today was the day that would decide my life. Whether I live or die, only God knows.</p>
<p>"My beloved aircraft! Please give it your best shot. Fight!"</p>
<p>I stroked my beloved aircraft and prayed in my heart.</p>
<p>The results of the motor test run were very good. There were no obstacles. The engine, on which my life depended, could be used with confidence, no matter how long it was used. However, I still carefully checked each part, as small as a needle, as big as a bolt. If there were any problems, the lives of several pilots would be in danger. Because I felt the importance of my own duty—directly preparing the engine—I carefully checked it. So, together with the ground crew, I cleaned the aircraft for the naval battle as if I were tidying up my own clothes.</p>
<p>X number of mobile units had already moved their propellers and taken off. They were heading in the direction of the reconnaissance line. The direction of the naval battle had a great relationship with the reconnaissance unit. If one of them discovered something, I believed it would surely make our operations favorable.</p>
<p>"Line up!"</p>
<p>The crew members nervously lined up.</p>
<p>The captain told us about the enemy situation and the precautions that should be taken during the attack, telling us to wait for thirty minutes before we could depart. This thirty-minute wait made us a little disappointed.</p>
<p>"Ah! We're going to be caught in the net again today!"</p>
<p>I shook my head uncomfortably and bent over, practicing aircraft operations.</p>
<p>"At least I'm going to sink one with one shot today."</p>
<p>I would sink one, even if I died without regret.</p>
<p>"We must sink them!"</p>
<p>The determination to die was overflowing from the faces of my comrades.</p>
<p>"Altitude ○○, speed ○○, distance ○○, launch! Evacuate at ○○ full speed!"</p>
<p>"As soon as we get close to the enemy ship, the gunner will use the machine gun to strafe and kill everyone who appears on the deck!"</p>
<p>"The gunner had already aimed the machine gun and was ready to shoot. If we encountered the enemy, we would definitely bomb and sink several battleships. If some of us couldn't return safely, our comrades would definitely avenge them to comfort their souls in heaven. They would laugh with joy when they saw us sink large battleships and aircraft carriers, even in the darkness!</p>
<p>We were eager to depart, running around anxiously, waiting for the departure order. My comrades became impatient, and often ran to the aircraft to check the torpedo loading status and inspect the various parts of the engine.</p>
<p>What was the reconnaissance aircraft doing? There was no report back.</p>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>"Line up!" The whole line!</p>
<p>This command echoed in every corner of the airfield.</p>
<p>"This is truly a sortie. Column ○○1, start engines, form</p>
<p>I started the engine and lined up the plane in ○○1 squadron. The engines of the elite planes roared together.</p>
<p>The propellers spun rapidly, bathing in the sharp light of the morning sun, reflecting a strong, dazzling silver light.</p>
<p>"Line up!" Commander ○○ Captain, slowly ascended the platform, issuing orders.</p>
<p>"Several enemy fighters have appeared!" "According to the telegram, the enemy mobile force is approaching us. ○○ aircraft are searching for the enemy. We will now also go out to search and attack the enemy mobile force."</p>
<p>On each person's face, a tense yet joyful expression floated, their eyes shining with an unusual brilliance.</p>
<p>How fortunate we are! To be born as men, and to be able to participate in this glorious naval battle.</p>
<p>The unit commander issued simple and strict attack orders to the airmen!</p>
<p>"The enemy is gradually approaching. From now on, we begin our search and attack. I hope everyone will remain calm, composed, fierce, and decisive, displaying the skills honed in daily training with a hundred percent accuracy. XX squadron is also launching. However, this squadron has no assistance. We should independently destroy the enemy fleet, and must not fall behind others! Finally, I wish you all success! Depart!"</p>
<p>As the time of departure was approaching, those departing and those seeing them off, grasped hands tightly in a moment of excitement:</p>
<p>"Ah! You're going off to war! Be sure to return safely!"</p>
<p>Though they said this, they did not necessarily hope for survival. Thinking that this farewell might be the last with the battle companions who had maintained the same aircraft for a long time, their hearts were filled with an indescribable emotion.</p>
<p>The engine was started again, and after confirming that everything was in order, it was handed over to the pilot, and the plane gradually departed. The battle companions who remained behind, lined up on both sides of the runway, to see us off into the sky. The battle companions stood in the billowing sand, waving their caps, and we waved back in response:</p>
<p>"We're going out to fight! We will definitely return victorious!"</p>
<p>Having left the squadron, whether we live or die, we only know to complete the mission, to do our best and await fate.</p>
<p>The aircraft squadron gradually left the land in the desert. Below, was the airfield where we had lived and worked for so long.</p>
<p>Saying a final farewell to the airfield, we bravely advanced toward the battlefield. Forming a squadron, we searched for the enemy in the boundless sea.</p>
<p>The military assault force was charging forward.</p>
<p>The blue sea connected to the sky. Patches of white clouds lined up one after another, and as far as the eye could see, there was nothing but the sea and sky.</p>
<p>In the midst of it, a large formation advanced bravely, filled with the spirit of hitting the target with every shot. Riding the Yamato spirit, they went to attack.</p>
<p>The clear blue sea of the South, the scorching sun, shone brilliantly, it was truly a beautiful time. Wasn't the atmosphere on that day, February 20th, when XX aircraft were dispatched to search for the same enemy mobile force over the South Sea, just like today?</p>
<p>In that naval battle, the enemy's aircraft carrier was sunk by us, but we also lost nine aircraft to kamikaze attacks. Many battle companions became guardian deities of the nation. The thought of revenge arose spontaneously. If we were to destroy the enemy fleet, how happy the comrades at Yasukuni Shrine would be!</p>
<h3>Waiting for "Enemy Spotted!"</h3>
<p>At 8:05 AM, the search aircraft sent a telegram:</p>
<p>"Enemy sighted, at 150 degrees from Panay Island, 130 miles, heading 30 degrees."</p>
<p>The telegraph operator grabbed the telegram.</p>
<p>Ah, we have been waiting for this news of "Enemy Sighted!" for a long time.</p>
<p>The intelligence officer marked the enemy's route on the map according to the telegram, and determined the expected location and estimated time of the naval battle.</p>
<p>The telegraph operator watched the receiver, waiting for orders and enemy information reported by the search aircraft.</p>
<p>The search aircraft's second telegram arrived:</p>
<p>Enemy position, 145 degrees from Panay Island, 165 miles</p>
<p>The enemy seems to be trying to attack our base, gradually approaching the base</p>
<p>The expected time of the naval battle is between 12:00 and 1:00 PM. Our fate will be decided in three hours.</p>
<p>At an altitude of several thousand meters, we peered at the sea, searching for the enemy. Upon seeing a ripple like a white ribbon, we immediately became tense.</p>
<p>The search aircraft sent another telegram: "Two battleships, two heavy cruisers, two destroyers, speed 20 knots."</p>
<p>Then: "The heavy cruisers are ahead of the two battleships, eh, where are the aircraft carriers?"</p>
<p>The aircraft carriers were nowhere to be seen. That was strange.</p>
<p>Yesterday's telegram said there were four battleships, two aircraft carriers, and more than ten heavy cruisers. Where did the rest go?</p>
<p>The staff in the aircraft seemed displeased that the numbers were different from what was reported in yesterday's telegram.</p>
<p>"It's a shame that the aircraft carriers aren't there!"</p>
<p>But today, we will personally witness the enemy's masts being destroyed in the sunset over the sea, not in a dream.</p>
<p>Looking through the window, the engines on both sides sounded imposing and extremely stable.</p>
<p>At X:XX, the search aircraft sent another telegram: "175 degrees from Panay Island, 105 miles, heading 180 degrees, speed 30 knots." Complete contact.</p>
<p>We thanked the search aircraft and rushed forward.</p>
<p>The enemy changed course at 180 degrees, fleeing south at a high speed of 30 knots.</p>
<p>That was like a moth to a flame. They had already entered our assault aircraft's operational range. No matter how hard the enemy tried, they could not escape.</p>
<p>The warplanes became increasingly mature.</p>
<p>Soon, dark "battle clouds" covered our heads, and a torrential downpour descended. The drastic change in weather caused a slight inconvenience. Flying out from under the clouds at XX altitude, we dodged left and right and broke through the rain. Inside the aircraft, the raindrops leaped and rolled. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Life</h3>
<p>— Yu Ruowen</p>
<p>A series of rustling sounds, "嚓嚓嚓嚓," suddenly arose from under the bed, startling Ah Ming, the coppersmith, from his sweet slumber. Although the sound was so faint as to seem insignificant, to Ah Ming, it sounded like the explosion of a five-hundred-pound bomb, frightening him and making him feel cold all over!</p>
<p>"Damn it, rats seeking divination, not a good omen!"</p>
<p>He quietly opened his sleepy eyes. He muttered. Then, he vigorously stomped his feet on the bed several times. The small animals under the bed seemed to "know better" and scurried into the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Lately, he had often heard this "rats seeking divination" sound. It was said to be a bad omen. Ah Ming originally did not believe in ghosts or spirits, and had always strongly opposed this so-called "rats seeking divination" nonsense. But in the past two years, after the death of his father and the incurable illness of his sister, he suddenly became a loyal believer in this "rats seeking divination" legend. Because in the days leading up to these two "major events," Ah Ming had heard that strange sound at night. From then on, he regarded the "嚓嚓" sound with both fear and hatred. Tonight, he heard this cursed sound again. Was something else about to happen? Ah Ming's heart began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>He gently touched the child sleeping beside him, and felt that the child was sleeping peacefully. Only then did he slowly close his eyes. He was very clear that tonight he would be so alert that even such a faint sound would startle him awake. So the scene from last night vividly played out before his eyes, causing him to sigh painfully.</p>
<p>It was about seven or eight hours earlier, just as the sun had sunk below the horizon, and dusk was thickening. Ah Ming silently dragged his little Ah Ming, who had only been born a little over a month ago but was already as thin as a little monkey, to his child's mother's place on Tongfu Road to steal milk. The term "stealing milk" was not an exaggeration by the author, but was very "true to its name." Think about it: his own wife was a wet nurse for someone else's family, and her milk was supposed to be given to another child. Of course, his own child had no share. But this child was born unlucky. It was bad enough that he couldn't drink his own mother's milk, but his father didn't even have the money to buy him milk powder every day. So he dragged him to his biological mother's place to drink a little milk that he wasn't supposed to have. Wasn't that stealing? Even Ah Ming himself admitted that he was stealing, so every time he carried his child to steal milk, he always did it secretly and quietly. This time, of course, was no exception.</p>
<p>He walked to an agreed-upon alley on Tongfu Road, and after a short while, the child's mother hurriedly came running. Without even saying a word, she pulled out her breast and stuffed it into the child's mouth.</p>
<p>"Sigh, I feel like the child is getting thinner every day—look, he's already terribly thin!... Is he eating milk powder?... Alas! Milk powder is so expensive... Poor child!" Ah Ming's wife hugged the child tightly, tears falling drop by drop.</p>
<p>"He eats some rice porridge, but he hasn't wanted to eat much these past few days," Ah Ming said worriedly.</p>
<p>"Doesn't want to eat much?..."</p>
<p>But before she could finish speaking, Ah Ming's wife's expression suddenly changed! She saw her employer's mistress coming in from the alley entrance.</p>
<p>She quickly handed the child back to Ah Ming. The child was sucking contentedly, but suddenly the milk in his mouth was pulled away, and he frowned heavily.</p>
<p>At this time, the employer's mistress, her face ashen, was standing in front of them. She pointed at Ah Ming's wife and scolded fiercely:</p>
<p>"Good! You have the audacity to come outside to feed your own child! I gave you freedom to come and go, originally because I thought highly of you, trusted you, but I never imagined you would be so heartless! I ask you, are you trying to kill my child! Let me tell you, I've been following you secretly many times already, and today I finally caught you!"</p>
<p>"Mistress!..." Ah Ming's wife was so frightened that she couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good! Leave tomorrow! Good food and good meals I give you, is to feed another child! Saying that, the employer's mistress angrily went back.</p>
<p>"These wet nurses are really detestable!" One of the bystanders muttered.</p>
<p>"Alas! This is truly a multi-layered social question!" Another young man sighed.</p>
<p>Ah Ming had no heart to listen to any more of their words. He hurriedly dragged the child back home. Regardless of the child's hunger, cold, or heat, he simply collapsed on the bed. Reliving the events of last night in a flash, Ah Ming sighed weakly again. At the same time, he felt all the cells in his body seemed to be expanding, expanding. He yawned, stretched his legs, and snores came from his nostrils again.</p>
<p>But not long after, Ah Ming was awakened by another terrifying sound. He opened his eyes. The room was already bright. He only saw his wife, Ah Ming's wife, squatting by the bed, pushing the child on the bed, and crying desperately. He suddenly asked blankly:</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the child...?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the child! You dead ghost! The child has already stopped breathing! You're still lying there... Ah! My darling, my darling, Mom shouldn't have left you! Ah, my darling, you died so tragically... My darling. My little darling..."</p>
<p>Ah Ming's wife wailed while banging her feet on the floor.</p>
<p>"But you... how did you come back now?..." Ah Ming was already stunned. He never expected the child to die at this time. Even more, he never expected that he would be so muddleheaded that he didn't even know when the child had stopped breathing. Especially unexpected was that his wife would come home at this very moment. He steeled himself and asked falteringly.</p>
<p>"How could I not come back! Have you forgotten what happened last night? The employer's mistress canceled my job. No matter how I pleaded, I couldn't get her to change her mind, so I had no choice but to go home. But when I came in and saw the child, he was already dead, and his body was already ice-cold. It seems he had been dead for a long time. You useless corpse! How could you be so muddleheaded... My darling, my darling, Mom harmed you, didn't give you milk to eat, starved you... My darling..."</p>
<p>Ah Ming stared unblinkingly at the child's corpse on the bed, tears flowing uncontrollably!</p>
<h3>Son of a Farmer</h3>
<p>— Xu Yang</p>
<p>I am a farmer's son, not knowing the end of hardship, living a life like endless hard labor, the plow and the harrow are my shackles; I do not raise my head to look at the sky, only silently watch the rice paddy field, the moon's reflection quivers slightly, returning with a shoulder of sunset, going to caress the ox before sleeping.</p>
<h3>Quiet Night</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>Closing the book, stretching, yawning, I seem to have been on a magical dream tour!</p>
<p>I find the surroundings so quiet, the city noises of the day gone, the whole world as if fallen into a death trap.</p>
<p>The only clock, reaching ten fifteen, also stopped with a "clank," tired? Or maybe ?</p>
<p>The wind, slightly blowing in from the window, has a brain-cooling chill. The turbid mind begins to clear from the disorder. Suddenly, I feel: one rain makes autumn! The rain that was still drifting in the evening, has stopped since when I don't know.</p>
<p>The black sky, not a single small star shoots a faint ray of light, nor can I find the silver bud like a crescent moon!</p>
<p>Quickly close the windows, pull up the curtains, I want to cut off that wisp of fragile melancholy from the outside world. No longer sad for it!</p>
<p>There is only a faint light in the room, evenly falling on the walls, table, and floor, without a sound, as silent as an ancient temple in the deep mountains, and I am like an old monk in the ancient temple: doing ascetic practices: but with an ancient heart, I can not help but stir up a ripple, perhaps the six senses have not yet been cleared, the mind is still inevitably entangled with knowledge and feeling!</p>
<p>I often have bizarre and strange dreams, heavy like old bronze, fine like silver threads, light like fallen red petals, melancholic like purple lilacs—I am immersed in the realm of ideals, longing for the bright place, a wisp of light smoke sighed! However, when the whip of life lashes my back, I wake up from the pain, rub my heavy eyelids, I look up and see the scene of reality—a fierce arena of survival!</p>
<p>From that picture I see all kinds of strange faces, but after all I see one thing clearly: the cowardly fall, the fearful fall into the abyss of death, the shrinking are trampled underfoot, only the brave, sharpening their teeth forward, then step on a smooth road to victory!</p>
<p>Quiet night, but in my ears there is a sound of fighting!</p>
<h3>Classroom Jottings</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhen</p>
<p>Walking into the classroom door, a buzzing, noisy sound echoes throughout the classroom. Clusters here and there, people talking and laughing about everything.</p>
<p>"Check! Check!... Good! Block the chariot, check!..." A very smug cry comes from a group of people by the window.</p>
<p>"Don't always, check with the chariot... block the chariot, check your ass!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I said you can't check, what's the fun of this kind of chess. It's better to move the cannon..." One student complained. Bang! Someone hit another student on the back of the head, "Damn it! Who hit me? Don't get angry because you lost the chess," and he concentrated on the chess again.</p>
<p>"Haha! Good! Move this one, you won't have anything left, check..." Another student said excitedly. Several students were pulling him and pulling each other.</p>
<p>"Don't make so much noise? You'll mess up the good chess pieces, you should go and ask for compensation..."</p>
<p>"Who's making noise with you, it's your fault, look, move this one, checkmate... checkmate what?" A burst of chaotic noise.</p>
<p>"Good! Checkmate, at least you lose..."</p>
<p>"Don't be so proud, just because you know how to play," a game of chess ended with each arguing about who won and lost, one word after another.</p>
<p>Someone threw a ball at a student's head. Coincidentally, it bounced from this student's head to another student's head, causing a burst of laughter. He quickly picked it up, preparing to retaliate. A student kicked it away with his foot, and the classroom became a ball field.</p>
<p>A student got the ball, "Hey! Pass... pass! Quick!" A ball immediately went from one student's hand to another student's hand. Carelessly, it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>"Ah!. Grab it!... A group of students immediately crowded over, all pressing on the ball, some rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>"The class monitor is coming... The class monitor is coming!" "So what if the class monitor is here, what's wrong with playing ball!" The class monitor appeared at the door. Seeing a lot of students mixed up on the ground, shouting loudly: "What are you doing! What are you doing!" He ran up and pulled up the students who were pressing on the ground, "Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Don't blame me for not being polite, write small characters!" One student got up, straightened his clothes, and said with a smile: "Pretending like he didn't grab anything, see! ...Hey!" And threw the ball to another student again.</p>
<p>"If you throw again, two pages of small characters, don't regret it," the class monitor put on a dignified expression, so the students stopped and said behind their backs: "How boring. Write small characters, behaving like elementary school ... "Ai! Behaving like a big deal, write small characters...."</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hui Chi</p>
<p>The thickness of the meeting cannot determine the size of a person's ability; conversely, the diligence of work can determine whether a person's future is bright or not.</p>
<p>A person who cannot grasp reality, diligently working, and only yearns for the future, ends up falling into the abyss of pain, never able to escape.</p>
<p>Young male and female students, without the word "love" hidden in their minds, wholeheartedly pursuing knowledge, the results are quite amazing. Conversely, spending all day immersed in the sweetness of love, studies gradually become neglected, the future gradually becomes dim, and contributions become pitifully scarce.</p>
<p>There is no eternal pain in the world, nor is there eternal happiness, because when suffering reaches its end, the sweet spring will constantly gush out, and conversely, when happiness reaches its peak, sad and bitter things will follow. This is mutual cause and effect, without any error.</p>
