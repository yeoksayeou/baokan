<h3>爲救濟河南旱災呼籲</h3>
<p>災禍之慘烈，未　　今年之甚的。河南，廣東，廣西，江西，浙江，幾乎是無省不呈災狀，不是水患，就是赤地千里的巨旱，這幾省中，更以河南的旱災更爲嚴重。</p>
<p>「去歲旱魃爲虐，夏秋未收，人民大都以菜蔬草根果腹，鳩形鵠面，慘不忍覩。入春以來，更形嚴重，各飢民將乾草磨細，和以榆樹皮粉，苟延殘喘，餓殍載道，觸目皆是，眞使見者傷心，聞者酸鼻。」（見今日本報載「救濟河南省旱災募捐啟事）而從本報今日刋載的澳門通信中，更沉痛的訴說：「……河南各縣，本來多是貧瘠之區，今年又遭遇了前所未見的旱災。「赤地千里」，「哀鴻遍野」一類寫災文字的濫調，已不足以形容豫災的嚴重。焦灼　旱，遮天的蝗，枯了麥作，毀了秋收，人民沒飯吃，嚼了草根，剝了樹皮，吞了泥沙，餓死的人，轉瞬變了白骨，慘景過於古時所謂「羅雀掘鼠」。人口死亡，不可數計，而一息尚存的人，就掙扎逃荒，往鄂北跑，往陝西逃。川鄂北也旱，陝西的糧價跟着漲。「這一幅流亡圖，凡是有同情心的同胞，決不會漠然無動於衷的吧。何况，轉瞬春夏之交，疫癘隨旱災飢饉而起，則災禍所及，恐怕決不止於河南一地。因此，我們不能不與發起救濟河南旱災的諸君同聲共鳴，籲請各界踴躍捐款。</p>
<p>河南，原是我國古代文化政治的中心，汴洛各地，尤爲中華民族早期發祥之區。然而數十年來，天災人禍，交相煎逼，山川爲之失色，黎庶流塡溝壑，廿二年黃河馮樓決口，廿三年貫台孟莊相繼破堤，廿四年黃伊洛沙同時爲患，廿五年旱魃爲虐。廿六年以後，又有黃河　道之息，所經之地，廬舍蕩然。誠如旱災募捐啟事中所謂：「人民困於顚連，無日不在水深火熱之中，即小康之家，早已十室九空，貧苦之民，更可想見。」恐尚未能盡其慘苦之事實，再加目前這樣嚴重的旱災，「人非木石，豈能坐視。」因此，無論從國家的前途，或是從國民的義務來說，我們一般徼幸處身於天災圈外的同胞，都有立即出力出錢，救濟豫省早災的責任。所以，敢向全市同胞呼籲，今日爲善最大而最切實的，就是踴躍救濟河南早災。</p>
<p>從河南的災情仔細研究，我們可以看出，目前最重要和迫切的，是糧食之施放，是流亡難民之收容，是災區及鄰近災區防疫工作之推進，和大量醫藥的接濟。我們竭誠希望辦理救災工作的諸君，多從這幾方面加以注意和努力，而更期望有關當局給以許多便利。我們同時知道，今日處於嚴重災禍下的河南，有一部份還在渝方統治之下，不幸的戰事還在繼續中，但是我們要認淸，天災並沒有什麼偏倚與好惡，不要說遭遇旱災的都是我們同胞，就是敵人，我們也應該有「己飢己溺」的同情與道德，而同加救濟。特別是在和平地區方面，除了急賑之外，還應該從事於治本的工作，如修濬河道水利，安置流亡，發給籽種耕具，推進春耕工作，以减輕災禍的程度，以防制災後之災。這點當然期望於政府與友邦日本人士之共同努力了。</p>

<p>（武者小路氏）大意稱、吾訪問中國、此行雖爲初次、但目覩京、滬兩地之明朗情况、深感新中國之前途、實充滿無限光明、並聞中國人民、對於此次國府參戰、以及日本交還租界、撒廢治外法權等中，日關係之好轉、俱　爲感　而欣悅、余亦至感忻然、余於此次中、日文協大會中、聞廣州代表　、日本乃以思想支配生活、但中國文化、却產生於生活、即文化之重點在於生活、此不但爲其特色、更爲其優點、苟一日超越此點、即爲生活所左右、但不應陷於以豐衣足食生活爲文化之英、美思想中、此在中國亦然、自古以來即不以貧窮爲恥、對生存恒輕視物質而注重精神、余認爲大東亞戰爭之原因、若就文化方面而觀、乃爲百年來會受西洋壓迫之東亞今已自覺、日本最先感覺復興亞洲文化之必要、並於謀廢止壓迫東方文化之西方文化時、在不知不覺中、吾人已認識不斷企圖榨取並壓迫東亞之英·美·實爲吾人之敵、更因無從以義理、使其覺悟、故終　訴諸武力、將其驅逐、東方文化與西方文化雖性質各異、但其水準、則東方文化實較西方文化爲高、例如於美術力面、中國古代書字梁柱及牧溪之作品中、不乏較西洋作品更高者、在日本則好宗達·光甚·池大雅等作品之精神、亦非世界任何國家所可比、中國之文化至爲優美、實爲東亞之先進、而使爲西方人士伏識東方文化價値之殺早者、至驅逐英、美思想、則日本實可謂東亞之先覺、中國於此點上宜仿傚日本、接受日本之指導、然余認爲因西洋文化在共本身、亦有可取之處、故吾人華在使其退出亞洲、俾期在亞洲方面、由東亞人自行創造文化、而後互相尊敬並進、此實爲世界和平之大道、中國應知日本爲東亞之先覺、而尊敬日本、日本應承認中國文化具有高尚優美之素質、彼此取長補短、此　目　最重要之事、余於京滬兩地曾會見中國靑年作家、彼等精力充沛、充滿建設新中國文學之熱意、唯以無暇互作長談、實深遺憾、余聞目前北京亦於周作人氏爲中心之下、展開新文化運動、余對此至爲贊同、</p>
<p>（谷川徹三氏）大意謂、增强中日文化聯繫之根本問題、厥爲東亞兩大民族應根據東方道義文化、完全團結一致、此爲謀中日文化前途昌隆之基礎、吾人由於已知認識中日文化結成一體之理想、目前極應使其實現、而此次大會中完成道義聯盟之基礎、吾人不僅應認識吾人在遂行戰爭、該對於此次戰爭之因何發生以及必然發生之原因、應有澈底之理解、故此非僅爲東亞歷史之變遷、亦不僅爲近代世界歷史之演變、更須洞察數百年乃至數千年之世界歷史、始足以明　因果、時至今日、中國人士對此次新中國毅然奮起參戰、向創　解放東亞民族、確立大東亞共榮圈之偉大歷史大道努力邁進之意義、已具有眞實之理解、吾人爲獻身於　設東亞道義文化起見、故具有四千年歷史之中國、應與日本　存眞止同生共死之決意、爲謀兩國文化之提携與昌隆、深信唯有彼此互相指出對方錯誤、始足以恢復其本來面目、對於此點、余在南京與吾人相晤之各靑年作家、亦能深切認識、並抱同感、率直言之、余深信中日兩國人士、抱正相互敬愛、日相五責難、始能迅速實現中日一體之文化理想、</p>
<h3>周作人在蘇　昨弔章太炎墓</h3>

<h3>澳門通信　豫省旱災奇重</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>近來桂林市上，雖然物價這樣高，而市面繁榮　百貨爭妍，雖然人們各有所忙，而種種塲所，還吞吐着大羣大羣的閒人。縱使煤炭貴如金，也有人燃着熊熊的室爐；縱使布帛稀如珍，人們也一樣的加了寒衣。如果念到各省飢寒交迫的災黎。他們或一家，或絕食，千千萬萬的人在死亡綫上掙扎。</p>
<p>念到災黎，不禁惕然心憂。今年最慘烈的刧難，是河南的天災。河南各縣，本來多是貧瘠之區，今年又遭遇了前所未有的旱災。「赤地千里」「哀鴻遍野」，一類寫災文字的濫調，已不足以形容豫災的嚴重。焦灼的旱，遮天的蝗，枯了麥作，毀了秋收，人民沒飯吃，嚼了草根，剝了樹皮，呑了泥沙，餓死的人轉　變了白骨，慘景過於古時所謂「羅雀掘鼠」。人口死亡，不可數計，而一息尚存的人就掙扎逃荒，往鄂北跑，向陝西逃。但鄂北也旱，陝西的糧價跟着漲。今年後方人士很注意西北，一到西安，就已感到豫民內遷問題的嚴重，而在潼　道上，災民絡繹，扶老携幼，盡是逃荒覓食的人。嚴冬大寒了，中原霜雪，西北寒風，衣單腹枵，那千千萬萬的災民將怎樣續命呢？爲今之計，對於豫災宜速辦以下幾件事：（一）豁免糧賦，另　軍糈，免向飢民索糧。（二）　辦急振，以救死爲目標，儘可能的减少災民的凍餒之苦。目前豫省已得透雨，這是一大轉機，官速接濟麥種，使田能下種。救濟豫災，時人盛倡移墾之議。其實安居勝於移墾，因爲移墾一要交通，二要農具，三要廬合，所費甚大，而安居只要濟食給種籽即可。</p>
<p>「今年遭受水旱偏災的省分甚多。如廣西旣有水災，又有旱災，都一樣值得顧念，但特別重視豫省的災情，是因爲災比較大。</p>
<p>當此嚴冬天寒之際，大家顧念到缺衣少食的災民，人不怕有偶然的過失或無心的罪惡，而最可怕的是同情心的汨沒。心上掛鈎，肚內畫圈，都是後天的習染，惟有利他的同情心纔是人類最可寳貴的眞情。飽食暖衣的人們能爲困於凍餒的　胞打一個寒噤，熱一下心窩，許多人的良心就得救了。（三十二年二月二十日寄）</p>

<h3>防空訓練的準備</h3>
<p>上海陸海軍防空司令部，於九日發表布告稱，自十二日起實施防空訓練四天。茲對上海四百萬市民大部分在其指導監督下的中國方面的民間坊空的準備，加以大槪的觀察。</p>
<p>防空上的協力體制</p>
<p>當第四次防空訓練實施的時候，中日及各國人民之一致的協力實爲最重要的事項之一。醫如說，虹口方面，租界方面，或滬西方面，局部的訓練時威　甚爲優秀，然而其他各區域的成續並不良好，則大上海的民間防空仍難望美滿。民團，工部局，及市政府方面故互相交換派遣連絡員於各方面的防空指導部，作爲其對策之一，使一致其步驟，以期全體的訓練獲得更良好的成績。鑒於上海中外人民雜處的特殊情勢，在第四次防空訓練中，務期中外人民，尤其是中日人民問，實現並昂揚在防空上的合作。</p>
<p>保甲國的防空運動</p>
<p>日方民間防空運動的主體爲改組後的新自警團，同樣，華方民間防空的主體，當然爲保甲自警團。第一次防空訓練實施以來，工部局新添設了交通防空課，並於工部局各警察署設保甲系，在平時爲保甲自衛活動的指導，在空襲時則爲防空活動的指導。保甲自衛團的組織人員數，現在達一七八·三四五名，這些保甲自衛團員與租界防空指導當局協力，在防空訓練中活動。該自衛團又組織了靑年部，有靑年前進分子一·四三六名，經嚴格試騐及檢查的結果而選拔出來，施以特別訓練。</p>
<p>這保甲靑年部當然不是爲了防空而直接組織，今後對這保甲靑年部在平時，非常時的活躍，抱很大的期望。該部已經編成了臨時防空隊，救火隊，交通整理隊及巡邏隊，近正計劃實施防空防毒方面的特殊訓練。十一日午前九時起，在靜安寺路跑馬廳舉行防空訓練發令下的靑年部訓練大會，並於各區特別組成的五百名的保甲防空團，平時受工部局消防隊，保甲指導部，及交通防空課等的指導訓練，與靑年部同爲有力的組織。</p>
<p>當防空訓練的時候，租界方面亦很重視結成保甲家庭防空羣，而加以不斷的努力，但尚沒有達到如虹口方面日方那樣的地步，尚在未完成的階段中，故確立家庭防空羣，將爲第國次訓練以後的重要課題。但最所切望者，平時保甲的隣保協力，應首先使之實現，庶一旦有事，保甲防空可互相協力。租界上若未能確保較現狀更進步，與日常生活相聯繫的保甲協力，則難期有眞正的防空合作。</p>
<p>適應各區的訓練</p>
<p>工部局應適應各警察署管轄下特殊的地理的及其他的情勢，尊重各區獨特的環境。警察署長不應離開了他治下的民衆生活的實祝而指導防空訓練。</p>
<p>七個區域之中，在過去三次訓練中成績最佳的是老闡區。這因爲該區多爲商店，種種防空設備費均由各保甲自動籌集，故有此成績。中央署管轄下的寫字間地帶成績就較劣，又如靜安寺路方面，居住者多爲智識階級，有日本留學生出身者等指導防空，故與日方的民間防空相彷彿。如此，各地區有各地區的特殊條件，工部局應用極大的細心，助長其優點，而去除共劣點。</p>
<p>消防隊的活躍</p>
<p>三次防空訓練的結果，日方華方都注意於組織或已經組織成功了家庭防空羣，在防火，滅火的活動上，期待於家庭防空羣的地方很大。但一旦發生事故，僅有家庭防空羣顯然不足以熄滅火患，故工部局消防隊應有積極的活躍。</p>
<p>工部局消防隊，爲準備在空襲時與民間協力起見，在交通防空課，保甲指導部等密切合作之下，對治下各區的保甲自衛團指導其自身的並民衆的滅火活動，此次訓練中，對消防隊的活動，期待甚殷。</p>
<p>加強防空宣傳</p>
<p>工部局交通課中，由華人組成交通宣傳班，隨時赴各工廠，馬路上，茶館舉行左側通行及其他的交通宣傳。這交通宣傳班，今後更擴編爲交通防空宣傳班，養成租界民衆在民間防空上的注意。</p>
<p>租界民衆有過半數的人，不解文字的宣傳，故直接用口頭宣傳爲最有效的武器，於是交通防空班的制成，必須依附於保甲。又據租界防空指導者所稱，對租界民衆，如機械地實施對日本人一樣的防空宣傳，非常危險。例如：一現在即有空襲存在。」這種宣傳，對日本人當然可以喚起他們的戰鬥精神，但對參戰後中國民衆的影饗，則與各種謠言聯結起來，釀成民衆道樣的心理，即「因爲參戰，所以有空襲，因而參戰是……」實施防空工作，在宣傳上需要一番苦心加以研究的。</p>
<p>像這種中日防空協力上的苦心，虹口方面日本人自團員也已經騐到，所以並不汲汲於確保表面的中日人的共同活動。同時，並考慮到强化中日人民之內部的心理的結合，在「先讓我們來做榜樣」的決心下，首先挺身於實踐的活動以示範。</p>
<p>防空訓練又來了</p>
<p>大東亞戰勃發以來，屢經訓練，發揮民間防空的力量，與軍當局的防空合作，充分的盡共重大任務的時期又來了。自四月十二日起，舉行防空訓練四日。此次的防空訓練期間，較前次爲短，若是長期，則在前期中的缺點在後期可以克服。但此次的訓練祗有四天，而且單獨的防空訓練不過前二天。所以我們在訓練開始之前，應先完成技術的及精神的準備，用特別緊張的情緒來試鍊此次的訓練。（翔：譯自四月十一日大陸新報）</p>

<p>平時設備認欠周密同時並聞救火會當局、對於此次貴州路發生火警、死傷達三十餘人之事、表示極爲遺憾、蓋當時雖經救火員奮力撲救、惟終告不及立刻撲滅、此次之敎訓、火政處當局認爲全由於平時民　防火設備之欠周密、並謂該幢樓屋、所居住民過多、以致發生火災時、多不及聞訊逃避、</p>
<p>查禁堆藏危險物品當局有鑒於此、除盡力革新火政事務以外、嗣後決對於居民防火設備、嚴加注童、並將大規模查禁危險物品之堆藏、及取締屋少人多、及其他不合理之居屋現狀、</p>

<p>竊案突增　主要原因</p>
<p>對於扒竊案之突然增多、據警務處督辦解釋、謂其最主要原因、乃由於華德路監獄最近曾釋放大批竊犯、因若輩刑期已滿、釋放後無以謀生、致行此種勾當、雖然、遭遇扒竊者、其損失常僅在十元至一百元間、至多亦不過五百元而巳、</p>

<h3>短評　防空演習是自己的事</h3>
<p>從今日起，本市將連續舉行防空演習四天，當局業已頒布辦法，公告市民嚴切遵守。</p>
<p>「防空演習」，這回已是第四次了。關於防空的技術上和精神上的準備，大家已經有了進一步的瞭解。所以這一次的演習成績，應當比較前幾次有進步的表現。</p>
<p>我們上海是一個戰時國家的重要都市，在戰爭意義上說，遭受敵人空襲，可能性很大，這是不必諱言，也小是詭言聳聽。可是，事實上到今天還沒有空襲過，那是幸運。爲了應付眞的空襲，就需要不斷的演習，每個人都有防空的知識，臨事鎭靜的工夫，就可以减少空襲時的傷害與損失。</p>
<p>不要以爲演習是「假」的，而澳不關心，不遵規則。如果沒有具備假演習的經騐，就沒有應付眞空襲的工夫。</p>
<p>最要緊的，「防空」要看作我們每個市民自己的切身的事，而不是軍政當局强迫我們做的多餘的事。我們千萬要明瞭這一點，以「替自己做事」的心情，參加防空演習，接受一切應遵守的規則。</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>日政府爲開發南方金庫之第二次出資，頃發行五千萬元之三釐半公債，日政府對該金康之出資，已達六千萬元。</p>
<h3>評言　澈查車積的對象</h3>
<p>國民政府此次明令嚴厲澈查囤積，又可說是經濟界的一件大事，更可以說是轟動經濟界的一件大事，因爲經濟界的本身，—「金融機關主要職員作投機買賣者，」—特別是此次澈查的對象。</p>
<p>我們時常聽得人家說，某某所囤積的日用貨品，總代價超過通貨幾萬幾萬萬元，某某所囤積的食油，足供全上海人口幾年幾年之用，某某所囤積的肥皂，足供全上海人口幾年幾年之用；這些傳說，有無根據，當然無從證實，可是，要它「水落石出」，完全在於主持澈查人員的重法不重情了。</p>
<p>說到此次澈查囤積的對象，我們知道是以金融機關爲主體，可是要嚴格地並且切實地去做的話，便當注意於這一個對象中的對象。假定是銀行的話，必須澈查其倉庫、廠家，必須澈查其貨棧。保險公司，必須澈查其倉庫保戶。主要職員，必須澈查其有往來關係的倉棧，甚至其個人與親戚朋友的住宅。這都是澈查對象中的對象。</p>
<p>這樣一個澈查辦法，才算是澈底，而這樣一個澈底澈查的結果則爲：（一）已經囤積者，難逃法網，（二）正在團積者，望風而潰，（三）預備囤積者，相顧失色，總的結果則爲囤積行爲的根絕，物品價格的趨平。</p>
<h3>市經濟局澈底平定物價　嚴查囤戶居奇操縱</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　查通來本市物價高漲，漫無止境，雖由一般商號，私抬暗盤，造成黑市，惟最大原因，實由於囤積所致，此輩囤戶，或係商民，或屬私人，居奇操縱，壟斷行市，助長物價，病商害民，殊堪痛恨，茲聞市經濟局以抑平物價，固屬當前要政，正本淸源，是在取締囤戶，業經一面派員嚴密調查，一經查獲，當遵照中央法令懲處不貸，一面獎勵市民知情舉發，如經查實，照章給獎，該局以此案係屬抑平物價安定民生根本要策，希望全市市民，盡量協助辦理。</p>
<h3>糧食部推進戰時　糧食統制分配</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　國府參戰後，鑒於戰時糧食之重要性，特改組糧管會爲糧食部，專管全國糧食生產管理，及配給事宜，該部自成立後，對於糧食行政，頗多　劃，中央記者特於日昨往訪該部周次長，叩詢關於戰時之糧食問題，生產統制，分配消費的槪况，承周次長答復，內容極爲詳盡。</p>
<h3>取締投機囤積　行莊審愼辦理押款　成交之押款　須呈報當局</h3>
<p>政府爲澈底取締投機囤積起見，業已派財次陳之碩等澈查各行莊放款以　究辦，同時銀錢業各行莊爲防止利用商品爲担保通融資金，均已依照銀錢業聯合會所議定之新放款辦法認眞辦理，對借款人之押品，以不違反現行法令。不致助長囤積投機者爲限。押品之選擇及估價折扣等特別審愼，期限視押品之性質由雙方協定之，但不得超過三個月。並以各業同業公會會員工廠公司行莊爲限，凡各行莊對於以商品爲担保交款時，應就下列各項具報公會轉呈主管機關備查。（一）借款人之公司行號名稱及其代表人之姓名。（二）放款金額，（三）放款期限，（四）担保商品之品名及數量，（五）担保商品之堆存塲所，（六）債款人公司行號之登記號數，或所屬同業公會之證明，此外銀行聯合準備委員會及錢業聯合準備庫，對於會員行莊之拆放款項一致緊縮，申請者須說明正當用途方准接受，其拆放期限，至多不得超過十天，凡以資物爲担保者，每一行莊以總評價不超　該會對於各該行莊核定拆放總額百分之二十五爲限。</p>
<h3>蒙疆與華中匯兌　採用特別圓</h3>
<p>張家口十一日中央社電　蒙疆與華中間之滙兌淸算，過去向以軍票爲準，現因華中華南停止發行軍票，故已改爲中儲券，及特別圓二種爲淸算方法，但蒙疆方面，爲便利起見，採傚滿洲同樣之特別淸算辦法，經與華中方面折衝後，最近雙方已成立諒解，故今後蒙疆與華中間之貿易，及貿易以外之收支淸算，一律改以特別圓爲準云。</p>
<h3>滬市金融工商市況　上週逐漸低平　銀根吃緊拆息升高</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　滬市上週金融工商市况，在當局嚴厲實施統制之下，已逐漸平低，一部份日用品反見升漲，此種原因，不外受投机囤積商人之操縱，影響所致，但週三政府下令派員來滬瀲查投機買賣及囤積奸商後，不法商人大起恐慌，粉求脫貨，且銀錢業拒絕押放，銀　趨緊，市呈供過於求之勢，價格益見軟疲，銀業拆息因而升高爲二角，聞下半週各業黑市完全停頓，各種物品公定價格，均穩定不動。</p>
<h3>越南華僑匯款本國　每人限越幣五十元</h3>

<h3>澈查投機囤積的反響</h3>
<p>奉國府命令，負有澈查上海投機囤積重要任務來到上海的財政部次長陳之碩，實業部次長袁愈怪氏等，到滬後立即開始調查工作，業已查竣銀行帳冊，十日開始檢查保險公司，預定十一日左右起檢查企業公司方面，截止現在爲止，判朋的調查結果及此舉對於租界金融工商兩界的反響大體如下：</p>
<p>（一）檢查金融機關的結果及其反響</p>
<p>四日檢查票據交換所，九日檢查金融機關的結果，查出有若干銀行爲囤積物資而支付巨額支票，據聞其中有若干與政治界要員有關的大銀行在內，國府對此將取如何處置，已成爲大衆的視綫，萬一在政治上佔有重要地位的關係銀行以收買物資爲目的而發之支票，藉政治上口實而付諸不問，僅僅若干普通華商銀行受到處分，那末預料上海金融界將要引起相當波瀾，現在金融界所希望的，主張的，與其肅淸民間經濟界，母寗先肅淸以政府勢力爲背景的大金融機關。</p>
<p>（二）對於物價的影響</p>
<p>由在主席澈查投機囤積命令頒佈以來，物價的暴漲傾向已被糾正，漲風一度停止，衆認這是因爲金融機關停止或减少簽發以囤貨爲目的的支票後所致。現在的物價高漲，並不是單因通貨膨脹所造成，根本原因在於一部份勢力的收買囤積，同時，大多數人認爲假使這個澈查結果，僅僅肅淸局部的民問經濟就此了事，那麽物價還會反動上漲的，就物價政策而論，希望來一個正本淸源的處置。</p>
<p>（三）關於企業公司等的處置</p>
<p>對於以上海財界巨擘爲主腦，與國府要人有密切關係的企業公司，如何來澈查？如何來處置？是上海工商界所最關心的，生產不振的時候，上海新興財閥等，紛紛創設企業集團，以及種種企業公司，形成了金融機關的別動隊，他們爲了自衛起見，和政界要人的結合，也未必可以斷定他是不正當的，但是和政治勢力結合了變成爲阻礙安定民生的投機活動團體，在復興上海經濟政策上，斷不容默視的，當局爲了監查金融機關，保險公司，也曾先後設立金融檢查機關事務所，保險管理局等，可是介於金融，企業中間的企業公司，還是放任，像雨後春筍一般的設立起來，如果說一律加以限制，可是就現在租界金融產業的實情來論，也欠妥當，所以大家希望對於不健全的企業公司，應該予以斷然處置。</p>
<p>（四）綜合的反響</p>
<p>結果，這一次的事件，給予一般租界民衆出於意料之外的深刻而微妙的反響，人們認爲這次的澈查要是虎頭蛇尾而草草了事，那末費了千辛萬苦創立全國商業統制總會想走上民族資本目主動員路綫的國府經濟政策，結果反遇障礙，深恐到了最惡化的塲合，還要促成政府對民間的政治上，經濟上對立，所以此際國民政府應該拿汪主席昭示的『罪已的精神』來一次政治上大肅淸，這是租界經濟界所不勝禱切的。（雲鵬：譯自四月十一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>譯論　取締投機的要諦</h3>
<p>澈查投機的國府命令公佈後，接着就開始調查銀行，保險公司，企業公司等的內容，此舉雖然已失時機，可是還應該鼓舞歡迎的。國民政府已經表示凡屬囤積投機，荼毒社會，擾亂市塲的，不問官民，一律嚴辦，而且很快的開始實行，國府這種嚴明公正的態度，任何人都願擊節讚賞的。</p>
<p>上海的投機囤積，不知幾許，一時要速斷速決，勢不可能，不過這些收買，囤積，是否爲銀行，保險公司，企業公司等直接所幹，或者以銀行，保險公司，企業公司等爲媒介而私人所幹，這是很明瞭的事實。可是這些投機份子，都有强力的政治背景，公然漠視工部局及其他的取締公令，是衆所周知的事實，非國民政府直接下手，取締投機談何容易。今幸國民政府公佈澈查懲辦命令，立即入手澈查，照上海的投機活動現狀來看，眞是極得當的措置。</p>
<p>取締投機的要諦，就是對於做大規模投機，囤積重要物資，茶毒社會，擾亂市場的人，不分官民，一律秉公處斷。要是一部份受罰，一部份漏綱，投機就不能澈底肅淸的。負責澈查的人，都是老成達練之士，而且是富有資望的人。不過和上海財界，有相當關係，一旦鐵面無私用公正態度處事，不免遭怨挨駡。所以先要有罪己的精神，破除情面，更要深思熟慮，不讓作奸犯科者有一人漏網，同樣的投機份子，不能有的逍遙法外而　資致富，有的身入囹圄而獨受制裁，應該一體秉公處辦。</p>
<p>同時還有一點應該考慮的，就是澈查要求澈底。回觀從來的取締投機成績多半是虎頭蛇尾而了事，起初的時候，來勢汹汹，臨了結束，毫無所獲。這次的澈查投機，假使重蹈覆轍，要曉得它的不良反嚮是萬分嚴重的。取締投機不行便罷，如果行而不能得其効，反將誘發大規模的投機，弄到不堪收拾的結束。誠如物價，一般商人看取締投機的聲浪如何而伸縮其價格，風聲緊，價格便低，風聲寬，價格就漲，因取締的實際情形如何而給予投機份子可乘的機會和心理，也有使物價反動高漲的危險。主持澈查者對這點是應該考慮的。</p>
<p>因勵行取締投機，預料上海　界，尤其是民族資本和國府方面，必然從而生出若干間隙。然而這是不得已的過渡現象，爲了减輕民衆的生活痛苦，也必須原諒的。但是，應該注意的地方，就是取締澈查，要公正，要嚴格，使民族資本畏服取締的公正。在道裏値得一提的，就是法令的尊嚴。要公正，嚴格，澈底，重法不重情的勵行取締。此爲我人深切期望於國民政府者。（雲鵬：譯自四月十一日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>孩子的春</h3>
<p>— 祖仁</p>
<p>彈回絲車，像蹲伏在地上的一匹怪獸，一隻十匹馬力的馬達，牽引着它的齒輪，它就在轆轆的吼聲裏，執行着它的任務。</p>
<p>阿元，是負管理它的責任的，這時，他正把他的小手，抓起一把把的回絲，小心地喂進這怪獸的口裏，他看着回絲緩緩的呑進去，吞進去，終於完全吞沒了，他再放下第二把，第二把完了，放下第三，第四……把，這怪獸就像永不會滿足似的。</p>
<p>他和這怪獸厮混了已是幾年了，所以，他那初見它時的驚異和好奇，也逐漸的給漫長的歲月佛去了，他對它的好感，也逐漸的减低了，他覺得它太自私了，一些也小顧慮到他的疲倦，祇是貪婪地整天的張大着口，須要他一天十二小時，一刻也不停地夫喂它那永不會塞飽的肚子，他對他的工作，漸漸感到平凡，厭倦，而失望了。</p>
<p>他有時簡直恨它了，因爲，他覺得自從和它親近以來，他豐滿的臉蛋，逐漸的消瘦了，血紅的臉色，也漸漸的蒼白起來了，最使他難受的，就是那滿屋飛揚的羊毛屑，雖然帶着口罩，但是鼻孔裏，還會吸進去，癢癢地怪難受，烏黑的頭髮，也變了灰花的，衣服，就從沒有乾凈的日子。</p>
<p>尤其是那無情的廠規，剝削得他失去了固有的天眞和活潑，雖然；他還是一個孩子，但是他已完全失去了孩子應有的活躍。</p>
<p>在暗澹的光綫裏，他把已失去靈活的目光，從窗洞裏看出去，外面，是一個誘人的春的季節，藍天裏，飛舞着各色的紙鳶，陽光裏，該跳躍着不少幸運的孩子們吧！</p>
<p>紙鳶，高了！遠了！帶走了阿元凝停的目光。</p>
<p>三月的暖風，洩露了春天的消息，也激醒了阿元的一顆失去了孩子氣息息息的心，他輕輕地說春天了！</p>
<p>是的！春天了！但是這裏，春天早失去了，昏黯的光綫，惡濁的空氣，配合着彈回絲車沉澀的濁息，沒有一絲春天生動的痕跡，也沒有一些春天的愉快，永是道般愁人的。</p>
<p>春是孩子們的，但是阿元是沒有春天的。</p>
<h3>憶兒童節</h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>淡藍色的天上偶然飄過一兩片棉花似的白雲，午後，太陽懶洋洋地晒着。</p>
<p>有時輕輕吹過一陣風，誰都換不定它打哪兒來，到哪兒去，只是臉上有種軟綿綿的感覺，像塊絨布擦過似的。</p>
<p>鐵路邊的池塘就懶懶地皺了一下。</p>
<p>於是人就聞着一股從鐵路那面飄過來的野花香，還帶着點腥味兒。</p>
<p>天氣不冷也不熱，是挺好的春天。</p>
<p>小紅費了半天氣力，在公園門口的籬笆旁找着金弟，她正在看西洋鏡似地從籬笆里向裏面出神地張着呢！</p>
<p>「金弟！媽叫你回去！等會跟爹過橋去！」</p>
<p>「姐姐！你來看！金弟並沒聽見小紅的話。</p>
<p>「什麼東西好看！小紅像大人似的鼓起嘴。</p>
<p>籬笆裏面的一塊草地上，芷有着二三十個孩子圍了一個大圓圈，兩個女先生立在當中，指手劃脚在演講，可是小紅聽不淸楚她說的是什麼，只見他們一會兒拍手，一會又唱歌，一會兒又嘻嘻哈哈地手拉着手圍着圈子走，一會兒又…………兩個孩子都不說話，一聲不響地看着，看着。</p>
<p>「姐姐！」金弟忍不住先開了口：「我們要是有一天也能進去玩就好了！」</p>
<p>做姐姐的不睬她，她忽然想起媽的話，「走！回去吧！你得跟爹上周家橋販米去！」</p>
<p>金弟還是沒聽見，轉過身子，她正看着從軍車上下來的一大批人，一個和小紅差不多大的十一二歲的女孩子，穿了一身紅衣裳，抱着她的一歲左右穿綠毛線衣的弟弟，在向她們走來。</p>
<p>「毛頭不丢掉多好呀！」小紅看着走過去的背影，想起了昨天剛生下來就被爹抱走的弟弟：「我們下回也能抱他到公園去，坐在草地上，唱歌，玩，…………」</p>
<p>「眞的！爹眞怪！」金弟也傷心起來：「好好的一個小毛頭要丢掉，眞是！」</p>
<p>「爹說的怪他生的不是時候，誰叫他投生到我們家裏來？………他說，這年頭………</p>
<p>「小紅！………金弟！………」後面跑來了根弟：「我我你們找了半天！你媽喊你們回去！………今天公園人眞多！………你們曉得爲什麼事？………」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」小紅金弟同時睜大了眼。</p>
<p>「我在公園門口問了楊老爹，他說今天是什麽兒童節，全上海的小學生都得到公園來開會呢！」</p>
<p>「兒童節？」金弟不懂地問：「什麽兒童節？」</p>
<p>「隨他去！回去吧！媽等會又要駡了！」小紅第一個跑起來。</p>
<p>金弟一不留心，撞在一個大人身上。</p>
<p>「小鬼！小癟三！屋裏向死脫人哉！」</p>
<p>一口氣跑進自已的面臨馬路的草屋裏，爹已經回來了，在替一個客人包長生果，媽坐在床上縫着金弟穿的小「保險馬夾」。</p>
<p>「小鬼！死到哪兒去了！」剛生產後的媽連駡人也沒氣力了：》「喊人的也不來，人喊的也不來！」</p>
<p>「媽！」金弟要緊把看見的東西吿訴媽。。「媽！今天公園裏人眞多！今兒是什麼兒………兒童節，全上海的學生都排着隊來，還有許多……………」</p>
<p>「關你屁事！」媽媽好像不要聽：「人家有的是錢，當然能過什麼節！你！你沒這福氣！………快把棉襖脫掉，把這穿上去！跟爹買米去！」</p>
<p>「媽！」金弟一面解棉襖的鈕扣：「我哪一天也到公園裏去？………跟姐姐，根弟，花子，………」</p>
<p>「滾你的蛋！」爹在旁邊等得不耐煩了：「你做夢！這些地方是我們去的？………跟你說，你命不好；就得幫幫大人做事！像小紅，她就會做生意。根弟只比你大一歲，已經跟她爹販米。你，八九歲了還一天到晚只曉得東跑西跑！」</p>
<p>「我也會包長生果包！…………」「金弟鼓起小嘴，跟爹走上馬路。</p>
<p>「公園門口人多麽？小紅！」媽忽然問。</p>
<p>「多！」小紅興奮地回答：「比每天要多無數倍！」</p>
<p>「把籃子拿來！拿點花生跟豆去賣賣看！」</p>
<p>「生意一定好！」小紅巴不得媽這樣叫她；「但是，家里沒有人，我去喊根弟……………」</p>
<p>「不用！你走！我起來了」媽從床上撑起來。</p>
<p>看見媽：眼睛又腫了許多，小紅猜想媽一定又哭過了，眞的！連小紅都要哭，昨天早晨，那末好玩的才生下來的小弟弟，可是爹跟媽嘰咕了一陣就抱走了，一會兒爹空手回來，媽就哭着，哭着，——剛才一定又哭過了！</p>
<p>要不然多好呢！她可也能跟根弟一樣，常常背着弟弟，到東到西去逛，讓人說：「瞧！他家小毛頭多胖呀！」…………　（下期續完）</p>
<h3>不肖子女</h3>
<p>— 方瓊</p>
<p>鬍子伯伯今天可眞嘔了氣，飯也不吃，站在後門口直瞪着天；他不管這小街堂里噪雜的叫囂，他祗看着天邊飛馳着的薄薄雲片，默默地搖搖頭，似乎他追憶起什麼似的頹喪着。這樣子，他站呀站的，直到夜像一隻灰色的狼靜靜的從東方出來，把拉長了的黃昏陰影，足跡一般的留在人問，他方才回到了房問。</p>
<p>房間里他是保不住，這里空洞洞的寂靜着，更顯得它陰濕而且黯淡，發出了一陣陣霉爛的氣息；他在房里兜了一轉，坐不住，終于他輕輕地叩着我的房門，順手的撳門走了進來。</p>
<p>「伯伯，進來坐呀！晚飯吃過了？」</p>
<p>我知道他最近心裏在悶氣，特別是今天，中飯的時候跟他的孩子嘔了氣。因此我喜悦地歡迎了他。</p>
<p>他向我微微地點了點頭，就一屁股的坐在我對面的那隻大木櫈上，他直瞧着我攤放在面前的桌子上的書，他似乎有點懊悔不該來打擾我。我明白他的意思，我乖巧地說：</p>
<p>「吃過晚飯，應該散散心，你來得眞好！」</p>
<p>「你好，你眞用功！在家裏總是看書寫字的……」</p>
<p>「沒有事也祗有看看書，　悶氣！」</p>
<p>「有了像你這樣的女孩子，父母該多福氣呀！人長得聰明，又有才幹，將來有出息呢！」</p>
<p>「你過獎了，鬍子伯伯。你們家秀琴，敏生，還有小胡桃……」</p>
<p>「不要再提他們了。這些那兒是子女簡直是一羣討債鬼。」</p>
<p>他說話神氣帶着無限的怨恨，長着的胳腮鬍髭在鼻息下面搧動着。我明白了他的心境，但是我竟說錯了話，這時候，我爲雜得不曉得該怎樣來勸慰他。</p>
<p>鬍子伯伯一家就是二個女兒和一個男孩子。戰前原來在恬靜的家鄉居住，那年流亡到上海之後，勉强地過活。漸漸地一家四口子的生活，有點熬不過這無止境的漲風的圈套，開始七零八落起來。</p>
<p>「我們家是XX地最有錢最著名的望族，我們的地位差不多可以入史籍，追溯上去幾乎有三十年之久。你們現在……」</p>
<p>鬍子伯伯不止一次兩次的把這些話來訓斥着他的子女，但是大女兒秀琴聳聳肩回答他：</p>
<p>「誰希罕這些，目前可沒錢用啊！」</p>
<p>於是她抹抹粉和口紅，花校招展地出去了。</p>
<p>兒子敏生長得不像父親，也不像他姊姊，他在家里不大開口，要是開出口來成篇大道理：他聽見父親的訓斥，他向他笑一笑：</p>
<p>「爸爸，這不是光榮的過程，這許多，應該隨着過去的年歲而埋藏到永遠，永遠的遺忘之中的。」</p>
<p>爸爸聽不懂他兒子在胡　些什麼，莫名其妙的看淸他。但是祇覺得兒子也不是自己的，也一樣不聽話，成天不在家。</p>
<p>小胡桃是個十五歲的女孩子，天眞活潑，她可以聽着她姊姊的話打扮打扮，也可以被他哥哥一班手來決定她和姊姊不同的人生。所以小胡桃不是跟着她姊姊，就是和她哥哥走在外面。</p>
<p>子女三個都瘋在得像三月里的野兎子似的看不見影子。</p>
<p>經不起半個月的時間，鬍子伯伯正式聽到這句話：</p>
<p>「秀琴在XX舞廳當舞女！」</p>
<p>這消息使　的心臟給這虎頭鉗緊挾住，透不過氣來。今天，快吃中飯的當兒，鬍子伯伯就警吿子女：</p>
<p>「你們以後不准出去！要你們坐在家里，一個也不許走！」</p>
<p>「在家里幹什麽？」秀琴火氣大，一出口就氣呼呼的。</p>
<p>「不要你們幹什麽。在家里看看書，你們沒唸過書嗎？」</p>
<p>「　唷—，要學斯文了！書本子丢在那兒去了？我可沒這份好福氣。嘴里沒有得吃的，要去啃書本子嗎？」</p>
<p>「難道要做舞女來活命嗎？」</p>
<p>「可以活命，不就好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「無恥，無恥…」</p>
<p>「假使飢餓像大蛇一樣盤繞你的頸項，你要假門假事的講究書杳門第…」</p>
<p>父女倆不客氣地爭辯得越來越兇狠。敏生却獨自個搬出菜飯來吃着。孫子兵法，貴在神速，他預備在這吵鬧聲中溜出大門了事。但是突然，聲音對準他這角落里響起來：</p>
<p>「敏生，不要吃飯就往外跑；沒有一天在家，到底跑到那兒去的？」</p>
<p>敏生斜着眼看了看父親，沒有回音。不是他膽子小，却是非常有骨氣的避過了道些刀鋒。</p>
<p>秀琴經過這一氣，她索性連飯也不吃，洗臉搽粉，打扮一陣子的往外跑。敏生帶着小胡桃，也靜悄悄地跨出了後門。鬍子伯伯看着他們的背影喘着氣，呼吸從他的胸底嘶啞的喘哮出來，像風在鐵匠的風箱里透出來一樣；任憑生了多大的氣，總留不住這羣執拗的不肖子女。</p>
<p>他始終不懂得，他的子女正如老蛇一樣，生命在受難和苦惱之中褪着皮，脫去了那張老舊皺縮無色的皮殼。但是他們却各自循着自己生活之路在向前走去—這是他們每一個人默默地決定和淸晰地閃耀於他們餓眼的陰鬱的光澤中的，不管他們把欐的是平坦大道還是汚濁陷阱！</p>
<h3>爸爸的頭髮白了　—未定草之一</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>爸爸的頭髮灰白了，</p>
<p>像是給深秋侵蝕了的</p>
<p>荒野上的衰草；</p>
<p>已遮蔽不住禿了的頭頂，</p>
<p>他的灰髮實在太稀少！</p>
<p>在慘黃的燈光下</p>
<p>牠們閃着黯淡的光輝，</p>
<p>我在默數他的年紀——</p>
<p>他還只有四十三歲！</p>
<p>他獰去了筆，</p>
<p>竭力撕開</p>
<p>那緊黏在一起的眼皮，</p>
<p>我看見部眼睛裏</p>
<p>充滿了血！</p>
<p>向我投來了乞求的光，</p>
<p>這乞求的眼光呀！</p>
<p>鈎起了無限的回憶；——</p>
<p>我還記得：</p>
<p>爸爸的頭髮白了，</p>
<p>他靈魂的頭髮也都</p>
<p>發了灰！</p>
<p>但是，我將以甚麼</p>
<p>來接受那乞求的光，</p>
<p>他靈魂的依歸？</p>
<p>我感到心靈的下垂！</p>
<p>兒子並不比爸爸强，</p>
<p>難道我將仍把乞求的光，</p>
<p>像爸爸一樣</p>
<p>低着頭，</p>
<p>他在寫，寫，寫……</p>
<p>勉强支持着體力；</p>
<p>通過深夜的寂靜，</p>
<p>常常聽見他那苦澀的咳嗽</p>
<p>和沉重的嘆息，</p>
<p>我很了解這咳聲，這嘆息</p>
<p>那是多末的親切！</p>
<p>爸爸摸撫着久病在床的兒子，</p>
<p>在那小西湖的深夜裏；</p>
<p>我還記得：</p>
<p>他的哭喪的聲音：</p>
<p>『爸爸的一生是完了，</p>
<p>全埋葬　生活的泥河底！</p>
<p>我的希望</p>
<p>已全部寄托給你！』</p>
<p>是的，</p>
<p>投向冉下的一輩？！</p>
<h3>陋巷中</h3>
<p>— 哲庸</p>
<p>陽光從未降臨到這一角，</p>
<p>斑剝粉牆掛出古老的創痕，</p>
<p>早上，晚間，臭水並汚物，</p>
<p>這遺棄的一羣，</p>
<p>十里洋塲之外的另一角。</p>
<p>賣糖人曾寄以同情——</p>
<p>以往的滄桑；</p>
<p>如今，紳士先生們却不屑一顧，</p>
<p>巷外的市聲早已鎮住了巷內的呻吟，</p>
<p>時代的齒輪節奏出雙重的交響——淘汰，新生。</p>
<p>繚繞的烟霧充滿着一角——飄渺的一如人生，</p>
<p>過去，如今，將來。</p>
<p>斷續的回憶空增了悲切，</p>
<p>這流星般的人生，南東西北，</p>
<p>灰黯的心緒對照着這灰黯的外貌。</p>

<h3>Appeal for Relief of the Henan Drought Disaster</h3>
<p>The tragedy of disasters has never been so severe as this year. Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang – almost every province is experiencing some form of disaster. Whether it's flooding or vast droughts stretching for miles, Henan's drought is the most severe among these provinces.</p>
<p>"Last year, the drought demon wreaked havoc, leading to no harvest in the summer and autumn. The people mostly survived on wild vegetables, grass roots, and fruits, appearing emaciated and haggard – a pitiful sight. Since the beginning of spring, the situation has worsened. Starving people grind dried grass into powder and mix it with elm bark flour to barely stay alive. Corpses of the starved litter the roads – a common sight that breaks the heart of those who see it and brings tears to those who hear about it." (See today's newspaper for the "Donation Appeal for the Henan Province Drought Relief"). Further, a dispatch from Macau printed in today's newspaper, poignantly states: "...Henan counties are mostly impoverished areas. This year, they are experiencing an unprecedented drought. The trite phrases used to describe disasters like 'red land stretching for miles' and 'the mournful cry of wild geese everywhere' are insufficient to depict the severity of the disaster in Henan. The scorching drought and overwhelming locusts have withered the wheat crop and ruined the autumn harvest. People have no food to eat; they chew on grass roots, strip tree bark, and swallow mud and sand. Those who starve to death quickly turn into skeletons – a scene more tragic than the ancient saying 'netting sparrows and digging for mice.' The number of deaths is incalculable, and those who still have breath struggle to flee, running to northern Hubei and escaping to Shaanxi. Northern Hubei and Sichuan are also experiencing drought, and grain prices in Shaanxi are rising accordingly. Any compatriot with compassion will not remain indifferent to this scene of refugees. Moreover, as we approach the transition from spring to summer, epidemics will arise along with the drought and famine. The scope of the disaster will likely extend far beyond Henan alone. Therefore, we must echo the voices of those who initiated the Henan drought relief effort and urge all sectors of society to donate generously.</p>
<p>Henan was originally the center of ancient Chinese culture and politics. The areas of Bian and Luo were the early cradle of the Chinese nation. However, in recent decades, natural disasters and human-caused calamities have repeatedly afflicted the region, causing the landscape to lose its color, and the common people to perish in ditches and ravines. In the 22nd year, the Yellow River breached its banks at Fenglou; in the 23rd year, dikes successively broke at Guantai and Mengzhuang; in the 24th year, the Yellow, Yi, and Luo rivers simultaneously caused harm; and in the 25th year, the drought demon wreaked havoc. After the 26th year, there were reports of the Yellow River changing its course, leaving behind destroyed homes wherever it passed. As stated in the drought relief donation appeal: "The people are trapped in dire straits, living in constant suffering, and even middle-class families are mostly destitute. The plight of the poor can only be imagined." This still may not fully capture the extent of their suffering. Coupled with the current severe drought, "people are not made of wood or stone; how can they stand idly by?" Therefore, whether from the perspective of the nation's future or the duties of its citizens, we, the fortunate compatriots who are outside the circle of natural disasters, have a responsibility to immediately contribute our efforts and money to provide relief for the drought in Henan. Therefore, we dare to appeal to all fellow citizens: today, the greatest and most practical act of kindness is to enthusiastically support the Henan drought relief effort.</p>
<p>From a careful study of the disaster situation in Henan, we can see that the most important and urgent needs at present are the distribution of grain, the accommodation of refugees, the promotion of epidemic prevention in the disaster areas and surrounding regions, and the supply of large quantities of medicine. We sincerely hope that those in charge of relief efforts will pay close attention to these aspects and work hard on them, and we further hope that the relevant authorities will provide them with many conveniences. We also know that today, part of Henan, which is under severe disaster, is still under the control of the Chongqing government, and the unfortunate war is still ongoing. However, we must recognize that natural disasters have no bias or preferences. Not only should we provide relief to those affected by the drought who are our fellow compatriots, but we should also have the compassion and morality of "feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowning" towards our enemies, and provide them with relief as well. Especially in peaceful areas, in addition to urgent relief, we should also engage in fundamental solutions, such as repairing river channels and water conservancy, resettling refugees, distributing seeds and farming tools, and promoting spring plowing, to reduce the extent of the disaster and prevent post-disaster catastrophes. This is, of course, what we expect from the joint efforts of the government and our Japanese friends.</p>
<h3>Mission to Japan Successfully Completed: Special Envoy Chen Bids Farewell to the Palace Yesterday, Expressing Gratitude for the Warm Welcome and Emphasizing the Increasingly Close Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of China's delegation to Japan, since his arrival, has been busy with engagements. Today, he successfully completed his mission. At 9:07 AM on the 11th, he went to the Imperial Palace to bid farewell, departing at 9:13 AM. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he and Xu Liang, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, held a tea party at the Imperial Hotel, inviting friends from various circles in Japan, Germany, Italy, Manchuria, and other countries to express gratitude for the warm hospitality received over the past few days. Attendees included Aoki from the Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan, Foreign Minister Tani, Naval Minister Shimada, Chief of Staff Sugiyama, the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, Manchuria, Thailand, and other Axis powers, as well as numerous Japanese military officers and civilians. The gathering concluded happily after 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Chen, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, upon completing his mission and preparing to depart, issued a statement today, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome extended by various circles in Japan during his visit. He also emphasized that Sino-Japanese relations would become increasingly close in the future. He stated, in essence, that since his arrival in Japan by order, he has been treated with great honor by His Majesty the Emperor, Prime Minister Tojo, and other ministers. The Japanese people have also extended a warm welcome, which not only makes him feel infinitely honored and grateful but also reflects the gratitude of the people throughout China. Since the beginning of our participation in the war, we have declared that we will not only share the joys and sorrows with Japan but also live and die together, in order to fulfill the historical mission of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the Greater East Asian peoples. Japan has also taken steps to abolish extraterritorial rights and return concessions to China, treating China not only as a friend but as a blood brother. The two countries are bound together not only by shared interests but also by a moral spirit that transcends interests. This spirit is now being realized in Japan's new policy toward China and is also manifested in the transformation of our country's general sentiments. Now, from top to bottom, we are united in our determination to contribute our utmost efforts in politics, economy, and culture to secure the victory of the Greater East Asia War and to accomplish the great undertaking of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What I have seen during my visit to Japan is that the Japanese government and people are united in their determination and attitude, which deeply moves me. Everyone expresses the highest moral and most sincere attitude toward our country, taking the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia as their responsibility. This spirit encourages China to strive for self-improvement and increases our infinite trust in Japan. During this visit to Japan, I not only expressed our gratitude to Japan, but I also feel infinitely inspired and honored to stand at this new and epoch-making stage of Sino-Japanese relations as a special envoy of our country. From now on, China and Japan will forever be brothers, supporting each other. This is not only for the happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people but also for the happiness of the world.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Kwantung Army, Umezu, Hosted a Banquet for Special Envoy Zhou Yesterday, and the Manchurian Foreign Minister Hosted a Dinner Party: Zhou Delivered a Speech Expressing His Determination</h3>
<p>Xinjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Commander Umezu of the Kwantung Army hosted a banquet at his official residence today at noon for Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of the National Government to Manchuria. In his speech, he stated in essence that the Republic of China was founded on morality. To realize the ideal of peaceful nation-building, it has resolutely risen. Thanks to the struggles and efforts of Chairman Wang and the heads of the government, the foundations of the nation are becoming increasingly solid. Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchuria on November 30th of the year before last, and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, and most recently, the return of exclusive concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by Japan, the country is prospering day by day. Furthermore, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Manchuria last autumn, Prime Minister Tojo recently visited Nanjing in return, the visit to Japan by Chief Ba Maw and his party, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Manchuria, and the visit to Japan by Special Envoy Chen of the National Government, etc., are all manifestations of the unity and harmony of the various ethnic groups of East Asia. Now, Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchuria further deepens the warmth of mutual unity among China, Japan, and Manchuria. I deeply admire Ambassador Zhou's visit. Special Envoy Zhou also attended the luncheon hosted by Commander Umezu of the Kwantung Army and Plenipotentiary Ambassador and delivered a speech, expressing the determination of the New China to resolutely cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. He stated, in essence, that this year is a new page in Chinese history. Since the Opium War, China has been under the oppression of Britain and the United States for more than a century. It was not until the friendly nation of Japan declared war on Britain and the United States the year before last that their power began to be driven out, and China regained its light. On January 9th of this year, our country also followed the friendly nation of Japan and resolutely declared war on the long-standing enemies of Britain and the United States, thus washing away a century of humiliation. This is truly a glorious and great achievement in Chinese history. At this moment, Japan, based on pure moral and friendly relations, voluntarily returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, enabling China to restore its freedom and equality. Even the revolutionary aspirations of our national father, Sun Yat-sen, have been realized thanks to the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. We are sincerely grateful and cannot express it fully in words. This year is truly a memorable and meaningful year for China. To win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War, it depends on how we struggle in the future. China will share this war and is determined to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan with full enthusiasm, turning powerlessness into power. In the future, I hope that our China and Manchuria will unite as one and cooperate with Japan to win the victory in this war. This is what I earnestly hope and believe.</p>
<p>Xinjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of China's delegation to Manchuria, after attending a welcome tea party hosted by President Kan of the Central Bank of Manchuria at 2:15 PM on the 11th, attended a welcome dinner party hosted by Foreign Minister Li at the Yamato Hotel at 6:00 PM. Many members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Xinjing also attended. At the dinner, Special Envoy Zhou emphasized that the Chinese people were willing to endure the suffering and burdens they should bear in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the New East Asia as soon as possible. He stated, in essence, that he was deeply impressed by Minister Li's remarks about the many difficulties in realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia, and that the union of East Asian countries and nations must be based on morality. The construction of a new Greater East Asia is indeed a difficult undertaking, so we must be aware of the hardships ahead. I believe that with our determination, effort, and endurance, and by seeking life from death, we will surely achieve something. This is also true for Manchuria. During this visit to your country, I have gained a lot of insights from witnessing your country's various constructions and efforts. I am convinced that with the temporary endurance and greatest efforts of China, Japan, and Manchuria, any national crisis can be overcome, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the construction of the New East Asia will also be achieved in the near future. The spirit of morality is the consistent spirit of the East Asian nations since ancient times. Using morality as the basis of unity is a permanent union, and using morality as the basis of peace is a permanent peace. After the victory of the Greater East Asia War, may each East Asian country, and even each country in the world, find its place, which is also the Chinese ideal of "the world belongs to everyone" and the Japanese ideal of "eight corners of the world under one roof" - the ideal will surely be achieved. And the achievement of this ideal depends on the unity of China, Japan, and Manchuria based on morality, and the common efforts of meeting each other with sincerity.</p>
<h3>War Results of Japanese Troops in Henan</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, November 11th (Central News Agency) - In March, a certain unit of the Japanese army in Henan engaged in 234 battles with the Communist army of Chongqing, with the latter having a force of 6,038 men, leaving behind 1,053 bodies, and 390 captured. The Japanese army seized 598 rifles, 9,045 rounds of ammunition, 17 light machine guns, 387 hand grenades, one mortar, ten pistols, and other military supplies.</p>
<h3>Surrender of Chongqing Troops in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>Hankou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing troops in the triangular area of southern Hubei were completely disintegrated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army. The remnants are surrendering one after another. In the Shashi area, from mid-March to early April, 464 Chongqing military officers and others surrendered, bringing with them light machine guns, rifles, and a large amount of ammunition.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Attack Guangzhou Bay</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, November 10th (Central News Agency) - At 10:30 AM on the 9th, eight Kansas (P4) type American aircraft attacked Guangzhou Bay. After dropping incendiary bombs in Xiying, they violently strafed residential areas in the city with machine guns, causing many Vietnamese people to be killed and wounded. Chinese homes also suffered considerable damage. The city's defensive artillery immediately launched a fierce counterattack, with one aircraft being hit and emitting black smoke as it limped toward the direction of Chishan. The other enemy aircraft also fled in a panic toward the northeast. It seems that the American aircraft's attack was intended to disturb the people's minds, but in reality, it did no harm to the Japanese. The deaths and injuries of some Annamese people and the damage to Chinese homes only exposed their inhumane behavior.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Occur Frequently between American and Chongqing Air Force Officers</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - Due to differences in treatment and the arrogant attitude of American soldiers, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have repeatedly turned against each other and engaged in infighting. According to a certain Chinese who recently escaped from Kunming to a peaceful area, on March 24th, an incident occurred in Chuxiong, 150 kilometers west of Kunming, in which a certain Chongqing military officer ambushed an American officer. The reason was that on that day at the Chuxiong airfield, an American officer, wanting to telegraph his beloved's birthday greetings, demanded that the Chongqing radio station urgently send the message. At that time, the radio station was sending an important telegram, so they refused. As a result, the Chongqing officer had an argument with the American officer. Unexpectedly, the American officer was unreasonable and started to beat someone, causing him to be shot in the right wrist by the Chongqing officer. The military and civilians of Chongqing were outraged by the repeated acts of tyranny by American soldiers.</p>

<h3>Mushanokoji and Tanikawa Release Impressions of Their Visit to China: The Future of the New China is Infinitely Bright, and the Ideal of Sino-Japanese Culture Becoming One</h3>
<p>Beijing, November 8th (Central News Agency) - Mushanokoji Saneatsu and Tanikawa Tetsuzo, representatives of the Japanese cultural delegation, arrived here on the 8th after attending the celebrations in Nanjing for the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and attending the second national congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. The two released their impressions of their visit. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Mushanokoji) In essence, he said, "This is my first visit to China, but seeing the bright situation in Beijing and Shanghai, I deeply feel that the future of the New China is full of infinite light. I have also heard that the Chinese people are grateful and delighted about the National Government's participation in the war and the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, such as Japan's return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. I am also very pleased. At this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Congress, I heard a representative from Guangzhou say that Japan dominates life with its thinking, but Chinese culture originates from life, that is, the focus of culture is on life. This is not only its characteristic but also its advantage. If one day it transcends this point, it will be controlled by life, but it should not fall into the Anglo-American ideology of taking a well-fed and well-clothed life as the essence of culture. This is also true in China. Since ancient times, it has not been ashamed of poverty, always despising material things and emphasizing the spirit. I believe that the cause of the Greater East Asia War, from a cultural perspective, is that East Asia, which has been oppressed by the West for a hundred years, is now awakened. Japan was the first to feel the need to revive Asian culture, and in seeking to abolish the Western culture that oppressed Eastern culture, we unconsciously recognized that the British and Americans, who constantly attempt to exploit and oppress East Asia, are our enemies. Furthermore, because there is no way to make them aware of this through righteousness, we ultimately resorted to force to drive them out. Although Eastern and Western cultures differ in nature, Eastern culture is actually higher than Western culture in terms of its level. For example, in the field of art, Chinese ancient calligraphy and the works of Liangzhu and Muqi are not inferior to Western works. In Japan, the spirit of works by Sotatsu, Mitsuhiro, and Ike Taiga is incomparable to any other country in the world. Chinese culture is extremely beautiful and is the vanguard of East Asia, and the one that makes Westerners recognize the value of Eastern culture as early as possible. As for driving out Anglo-American thought, Japan can be said to be the pioneer of East Asia. China should emulate Japan in this respect and accept Japan's guidance. However, I believe that there are also merits in Western culture itself, so we should let it withdraw from Asia so that Asians can create culture on their own in Asia, and then respect each other and advance together. This is the great way to world peace. China should know that Japan is the pioneer of East Asia and respect Japan. Japan should recognize that Chinese culture has noble and beautiful qualities and learn from each other's strengths. This is the most important thing at present. I have met young Chinese writers in Beijing and Shanghai. They are energetic and full of enthusiasm for building a new Chinese literature. It is a pity that I did not have time to talk with them at length. I have heard that a new cultural movement is also being launched in Beijing under the leadership of Mr. Zhou Zuoren. I strongly agree with this."</p>
<p>(Tanikawa) In essence, he said, "The fundamental issue of strengthening Sino-Japanese cultural ties is that the two major ethnic groups in East Asia should be completely united based on Eastern moral culture. This is the foundation for the future prosperity of Sino-Japanese culture. Because we have already known and recognized the ideal of Sino-Japanese culture becoming one, we should realize it as soon as possible. And at this conference, the foundation for the establishment of a moral alliance has been completed. We should not only recognize that we are waging war, but we should also have a thorough understanding of why this war occurred and why it had to occur. Therefore, this is not only a change in East Asian history, nor is it just an evolution of modern world history, but it is necessary to understand hundreds or even thousands of years of world history in order to clarify the cause and effect. To this day, the Chinese people have a real understanding of the significance of the New China's resolute uprising to participate in the war, striving to open up the great historical road of liberating the East Asian nations and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to dedicate ourselves to establishing an East Asian moral culture, China, with its four thousand years of history, should have the determination to coexist and die together with Japan. In order to promote the cooperation and prosperity of the two countries' cultures, I firmly believe that only by pointing out each other's mistakes can we restore their original features. On this point, the young writers I met in Nanjing also deeply recognized and shared the same feeling. Frankly speaking, I firmly believe that only when the Chinese and Japanese people embrace mutual love and hold each other accountable can they quickly realize the cultural ideal of Sino-Japanese unity."</p>
<h3>Zhou Zuoren Pays Respects at Zhang Taiyan's Tomb in Suzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Suzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in Suzhou, National Government Committee Member Zhou Zuoren personally went to the tomb of Master of Chinese Studies Zhang Taiyan at 10:00 AM on the 10th to pay his respects and express his condolences. After meeting with Governor Li at the Governor's Mansion at about 11:00 AM, he visited the former residence of Yu Quyuan. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the Provincial Department of Education. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, he gave a lecture at the Provincial Educational Institute entitled "The Application of Knowledge". At about 4:00 PM, he toured the Lion Grove Garden, Tiger Hill, and other scenic spots. In the evening, the Suzhou branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association hosted a banquet for Zhou and others, inviting Chinese and Japanese dignitaries to accompany them. It is reported that Zhou and his party are scheduled to leave Suzhou and return to Beijing on the morning of the 12th. Zhou also released the following thoughts on his visit to Suzhou: "I was appointed as a committee member by the National Government. This time, I came to Beijing to report my duties, visit Chairman Wang, and give a lecture at Central University. Later, I learned that Mr. Taiyan was buried in his residence after his death, so I temporarily decided to visit Suzhou to pay my respects at his tomb and visit the site of the former Chinese Studies Society. I will only stay in Suzhou for one day and must return to Beijing. I have visited Lingyan Mountain and Xuanmiao Temple. From what I have seen in Muduo and the city, the people live well and are very gratifying. As for the scenery of Jiangnan, I grew up in eastern Zhejiang and am familiar with it. Since I have lived in the north for a long time, I have missed it for a long time. It is even more gratifying to see it again today."</p>

<h3>Macau Correspondence: Severe Drought in Henan Province</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>Recently, in Guilin City, although prices are high, the market is prosperous, and department stores compete to display beautiful goods. Although people are busy with their respective tasks, various venues still accommodate large groups of leisurely individuals. Even though coal is as expensive as gold, some people still burn roaring room heaters; even though cloth is as rare as treasures, people still add warm clothing. Considering the starving and freezing refugees in various provinces, who are either starving as families or perishing altogether, millions of people are struggling on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Thinking of the refugees, one cannot help but feel alarmed and worried. This year's most devastating calamity is the natural disaster in Henan. The counties of Henan have always been impoverished areas, and this year they have suffered an unprecedented drought. The cliché phrases used to describe disasters, such as "thousands of miles of barren land" and "mournful cries filling the wilderness," are no longer sufficient to describe the severity of the Henan disaster. The scorching drought and the sky-covering locusts have withered the wheat crops and destroyed the autumn harvest. People have no food to eat, so they chew on grass roots, peel tree bark, and swallow mud and sand. Those who have starved to death have turned into white bones. The tragic scene surpasses the ancient saying "catching sparrows and digging for rats." The population death toll is incalculable, and those who still have a breath of life struggle to flee the famine, heading towards northern Hubei and escaping to Shaanxi. However, northern Hubei is also experiencing drought, and grain prices in Shaanxi are rising accordingly. This year, people in the rear areas are paying close attention to the Northwest. Upon reaching Xi'an, one can already feel the severity of the problem of Henan people migrating inward. On the Tongguan Road, there is a constant stream of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, all fleeing the famine in search of food. As the severe winter arrives, the central plains are covered in frost and snow, and the northwest winds are biting. How will those millions of refugees continue their lives with only thin clothing and empty stomachs? For the present, the following measures should be taken quickly for the Henan disaster: (1) Waive grain taxes and military supplies, and do not demand grain from the starving people. (2) Provide emergency relief, with the goal of saving lives and reducing the suffering of the refugees from freezing and starvation as much as possible. Currently, Henan Province has received soaking rain, which is a major turning point. Officials should quickly provide wheat seeds so that the fields can be sown. There is a prevailing advocacy for resettlement to relieve the Henan disaster. In fact, settling in place is better than resettlement, because resettlement requires transportation, agricultural tools, and lodging, which are very costly, while settling in place only requires providing food and seeds.</p>
<p>"Many provinces have suffered from water and drought disasters this year. For example, Guangxi has both floods and droughts, which are also worthy of attention, but special attention is paid to the disaster situation in Henan Province because the disaster is relatively large.</p>
<p>At this time of severe winter, everyone cares about the refugees who lack clothing and food. People are not afraid of accidental mistakes or unintentional sins, but the most terrible thing is the obliteration of compassion. Holding grudges and being calculating are all acquired habits, but altruistic compassion is the most precious true feeling of mankind. If those who are well-fed and warmly clothed can shiver for their compatriots who are trapped in freezing and starvation and warm their hearts, the conscience of many people will be saved."

<h3>Powerful Japanese Military in the Pacific Causes Deep Unease in Australia</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 10th (Central News Agency) - Following the renewed large-scale operations by the Japanese naval air force in the Southwest Pacific, Australia has expressed deep unease and stressed the need to strengthen the defense of the Southwest Pacific. Three or four days ago, the Australian government and frontline commanders of the US military strongly called for the Allied High Command in Washington to increase its strength, stating that the existing forces in the Southwest Pacific were insufficient to prevent a Japanese invasion. Australian Naval Minister Makin, in a speech in Adelaide, stated that Japanese forces have been actively constructing bases on islands north of Australia, while Army Minister Ford also stated that the Japanese are actively constructing new bases and increasing their forces. Therefore, the Allies must prepare for even greater sacrifices in the future, as the strength of the Japanese military in the Southwest Pacific is undeniable.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force recently launched large-scale air raids on Oro Bay on the island of New Guinea and fiercely attacked Tulagi Harbor on Florida Island, achieving glorious results and causing a great shock to the US government and public. On the 8th, the United Press acknowledged that the situation on the Pacific front had become serious again, stating that the state of normalcy on the Pacific front had come to an end. Based on the activities of the Japanese and US forces in recent days, it is known that a large-scale battle is about to unfold. The Japanese military has adopted bold offensive operations in recent days and strengthened the defense lines of its vast newly occupied territories to prevent US military operations. The Japanese naval air force's bombing of Allied ships in New Guinea and US ships in Oro Bay is a manifestation of the Japanese military's defensive offensive. US Secretary of the Army Stimson stated during a meeting with reporters on the 8th that the strength of the Japanese air force on the Asian mainland front and the Southwest Pacific front has increased significantly, and that the US military has also increased its air force strength in that area and will continue to strengthen it in the future. It is believed that Stimson's remarks are based on the results of the Washington military conference. It is believed that the Washington military conference seems to have agreed to strengthen the Allied forces in the Pacific and East Asian fronts as much as possible, within the scope of the Casablanca meeting. In addition, US Army Chief of Staff, Major General Somervell, and Air Force Commander, Major General Kenney, and four others who participated in the conference returned to the Southwest Pacific Allied Command on the 7th to report the results of the conference to MacArthur and held meetings for several consecutive days. It is said that frontline commanders of the US military have high expectations for Stimson's remarks. According to a report from the Reuters correspondent at the New Guinea forward base on the 9th, the Allied Command welcomes US Secretary of the Army Stimson's statement on strengthening the air force in the South Pacific. It is believed that the Allied Command believes that the United States currently has at least 10,000 military aircraft awaiting orders, and it would be easy to transfer a portion of them to the Southwest Pacific, so it has repeatedly requested the US government to strengthen the air force in various aspects.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Combined Formation Bombs British Ships on the Naf River, Attacks Allied Airfield in Chittagong, British Press Admits Defeat on Indo-Burma Border</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi states that according to the Allied Command in India, on the 9th, a combined formation of Japanese fighter-bombers bombed British ships on the Naf River in southeastern Bengal and heavily bombed British positions in southeastern Bengal. The British military also attempted to rescue troops surrounded by the Japanese military in the Rakhine region of the Maungdaw Peninsula. However, according to the Allied Command, British fighter planes lost two aircraft in the fighting in that area.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Allied India Expeditionary Force Command announced on the 10th that the Japanese air force again attacked the Allied airfield south of Chittagong on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the British Indian army on the Indian border, news of victories has been frequently reported. The entire people of Burma are deeply excited and know even more about the strength of the Japanese army and trust them even more. On the 10th, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that elite Japanese troops had annihilated the British Indian 6th Brigade in the Bay of Bengal and captured its brigade commander. A local English-language newspaper issued an extra edition last night to publish the news and posted it on the bustling streets of the city. At that time, almost all the Burmese people who watched were ecstatic.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - Following the success of the Japanese army's operations on the Mayu Peninsula, the Allied forces in that area have suffered a disastrous defeat. Britain's bold claims of recapturing Burma have completely become illusions. According to a dispatch from London, The Times published the war situation on the Indo-Burma border for the first time on the 9th and frankly admitted the British army's retreat, stating that the British army's withdrawal from the Mayu River position was unavoidable. At present, it only occupies the positions north of Donbaik and east of Rathedaung. The pressure from the Japanese army is gradually increasing. The British army may continue to retreat before the arrival of the monsoon season, so there is no hope of recapturing Buthidaung.</p>

<h3>German Forces in Southern Tunisia Arrive in the Sfax Mountain Area, Fierce Fighting in Progress Between the Central Route of Pichon and Kairouan, Northern Military Center Still at Djebel Cheddada</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the North African front, British and American forces in northern Tunisia, with the support of French rebels, launched fierce attacks on Axis positions on the 9th in three areas surrounding Pichon, Bou Arada, El Babs Road, and Medjez el Bab. However, all of them were separately defeated by the Axis forces. The southern Pichon area was surrounded by Axis forces and lost 15 tanks. According to various sources, Tunisia has recently entered a decisive stage of the war. According to a report in The Times of London on the 10th, the first strategic phase of the Allied forces has ended and they have now entered a decisive stage.</p>
<p>Bern, 11th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in North Africa reported today that General Rommel is currently moving his main forces northward towards a new defense line to complete his effective delaying tactic. The correspondent believes that General Rommel is moving towards the mountainous area, with his troops starting from Enfidaville, northwest of Sousse, westward through the Kairouan area to the rear of the Axis forces near Bir Khiria, providing considerable cover, deploying artillery along the way, and preventing the attacks of the Eighth Army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced last night that Marshal Rommel's forces in southern Tunisia had avoided Allied attacks, while the Axis forces in the Medjez el Bab and Pichon areas slightly to the north were holding their ground. On Friday, they repelled enemy forces that had attacked repeatedly. The British and Americans are constantly reinforcing with new troops and engaging in fierce battles in the mountainous areas of central and northern Tunisia. The fighting near Medjez el Bab and Pichon was particularly intense on Friday. On the road starting from Medjez el Bab, the British army lost 33 tanks, 11 cannons, and 6 reconnaissance vehicles within 24 hours. As a result, the attacking British infantry had collapsed in front of the German lines. In the fighting in the Pichon area, the British and American forces also suffered heavy losses, especially in the area near the Fondouk Pass. Thirty-two Allied tanks were destroyed. Most of Marshal Rommel's forces in the southern area have retreated further north, and have now generally reached the hilly areas of Sfax. During this operation, the Axis forces fought hard with the advancing Allied forces at several locations. The German and Italian forces, with fewer troops, retreated only after completing their mission. Rommel's actions clearly aimed to withdraw his forces northward to strengthen the Axis defense line in the mountainous area of Tunisia. The British army's repeated attempts to disrupt Rommel's movements or to break through were unsuccessful. The German and Italian air forces are also constantly assisting in the ground fighting. The Axis air force is dedicated to attacking the British and American rear transportation lines approaching the front lines and the Allied artillery positions. The Axis air force's cooperation with the German and Italian armies in central and northern Tunisia has been particularly effective, preventing the full deployment of the Allied attacking forces. A military reporter from the Havas News Agency reviewed the general long-term symmetry of Tunisia last night. The Allies had previously expected to launch a major attack with extremely elite forces from the Pichon area towards Kairouan. This has now been realized since Friday. This battle has left a mark on the Tunisian war, as the British and American hope to advance towards Sousse on the Mediterranean coast would pose a serious threat of encirclement to the Axis forces fighting the British Eighth Army in the south. The danger of this threat should not be ignored. Therefore, it has been confirmed that General Patton has shifted the center of gravity of his American Fifth Army to the left flank, which is currently attacking Kairouan. Elite British troops have also joined the American forces in the battle. The French rebel forces in the Ousseltia area slightly to the north have also joined the attack. The far superior Allied forces have passed through Pichon and broken through the Axis lines in several places, but this breakthrough has been contained. The Allied forces continue to increase pressure, especially near Fondouk. The Axis command is currently striving to prevent the Allied forces from breaking through to Sousse. On Friday night, the mobile forces under General Montgomery had crossed the line from Maktar to Mahares. Yesterday morning, the vanguard of British tanks approached the port of Sfax. The constant replenishment of Allied reserves is worthy of attention. General Montgomery has replaced the first batch of attacking troops that broke through the lines four days ago with all fresh troops. The Axis forces have been fighting continuously for many weeks and in difficult conditions, especially with the enemy's air superiority continuing to increase. The entire British First Army has now joined the fighting in northern Tunisia. The center of this war is still in the area of Djebel Cheddada and Medjez el Bab, and the mountainous area north of the road. The German mountain warfare troops stationed in that area have contained the British First Army's eastward advance. The mountain range in the area extends westward, posing a major obstacle to the left flank of General Anderson's forces fighting in the coastal area. Therefore, the British commander is attempting to clear it first. The British army has not yet achieved a decisive victory, and the war is continuing.</p>

<h3>Wife of the Iron Lung Man to Give Birth Again in August</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Miami, Florida, the wife of iron lung patient Snyder announced yesterday that she will give birth again in August. The iron lung man suffered from paralysis in 1936 and has since lived in an iron lung. He returned to the United States from the Far East in 1937 and lived in Chicago.

<h3>Franco to Tour, Spanish Foreign Minister Meets Italian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Spanish Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - Spanish Head of State General Franco will begin a tour of northwestern Spain on Tuesday. After inspecting Meras in Galicia Province, the Head of State will attend the opening ceremony of the Santiago to La Coruña railway on Wednesday. Spanish Capital, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Stefani Agency reports that Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana met with the newly appointed Italian Ambassador to Spain, Gallinari, yesterday and presented the copy of the credentials to the Spanish Foreign Minister. The two had a very pleasant conversation.</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliament Passes German-Turkish Loan Agreement</h3>

<h3>Allied Forces in the Near East Launch Counter-Offensive Activities on the European Continent, Rumor Wilson Will Visit Ankara to Exert Coercive Diplomacy on Turkey</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 11th (Central News Agency) - Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the Allied forces are attempting to use the Balkans as a foothold for a counter-offensive against Europe, and have therefore been continuously gathering forces in Syria, Palestine, and various islands in the eastern Mediterranean, and intensifying training for landing operations. According to news from Cairo, Wilson, who was transferred from the commander of the Iranian and Iraqi forces to the commander of the British Middle East Forces, has repeatedly held military conferences with Holmes, the commander of the British Ninth Army in Syria, since taking office. Recently, he also met with the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, in Jerusalem to hold important discussions on the Turkish issue. Afterward, Wilson and Holmes flew to Cyprus and held an important strategic meeting in Nicosia with British Chief of Staff Brooke and others. All of this can be seen as the Allied forces actively preparing for a counter-offensive against Europe in both military and political terms. The British army on Cyprus seems to be intensely training paratroopers. At the same time, diplomatic work with Turkey is also scheduled to be carried out by Wilson in person during a visit to Ankara. It is not difficult to imagine that Britain is also exerting its coercive diplomacy on Turkey.</p>
<h3>Papen's Transfer Rumor Denied by Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - The rumor that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen will be transferred to Spain was denied by the German Foreign Ministry yesterday, stating that this rumor occurs every so often and is just as foolish as the rumors of German peace feelers.</p>
<h3>US Military Casualties Since the Start of the War Exceed 70,000</h3>

He said that it is easy for the new bomber to take off from its base in western France and fly to New York. The aircraft is equipped with a 1,000-horsepower engine and can reach New York in 20 hours. Only 40 tons of fuel is needed for the round trip, and German submarines in the Atlantic can provide detailed information about the weather at any time and provide great assistance. This long-distance bombing will deal a great blow to the morale of the American people, and the consequences will certainly be serious.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Air Defense Drills</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced on the 9th that air defense drills would be conducted for four days starting from the 12th. Here is a general observation of the preparations for civilian air defense on the Chinese side, under their guidance and supervision, for the majority of Shanghai's four million citizens.</p>
<p>Cooperation System for Air Defense</p>
<p>When the fourth air defense drill is implemented, the unanimous cooperation of Chinese, Japanese, and people of all countries is one of the most important matters. For example, if the local training in the Hongkou area, the concession area, or the western Shanghai area is very excellent, but the results in other areas are not good, then satisfactory civilian air defense for greater Shanghai is still difficult to achieve. Civil defense groups, the Public Works Department, and the municipal government have mutually exchanged liaison officers to the air defense guidance departments in various areas as one of their countermeasures, so that their steps are consistent, in order to obtain better results in the overall training. In view of the special situation in Shanghai where Chinese and foreign people live together, in the fourth air defense drill, it is essential that Chinese and foreign people, especially the Chinese and Japanese people, realize and promote cooperation in air defense.</p>
<p>Air Defense Movement in the Baojia System</p>
<p>The main body of the Japanese side's civilian air defense movement is the newly reorganized self-defense corps. Similarly, the main body of the Chinese side's civilian air defense is, of course, the Baojia self-defense corps. Since the first air defense drill was implemented, the Public Works Department has newly established a traffic air defense section, and has established Baojia sections in each Public Works Department police station. These sections provide guidance for Baojia self-defense activities in peacetime, and guidance for air defense activities during air raids. The number of personnel organized in the Baojia self-defense corps now reaches 178,345. These Baojia self-defense corps members cooperate with the concession air defense guidance authorities and participate in air defense drills. The self-defense corps has also organized a youth division, with 1,436 progressive young people selected through rigorous testing and inspection to receive special training.</p>
<p>This Baojia youth division is of course not directly organized for air defense. Great expectations are held for the active role of this Baojia youth division in peacetime and in emergencies. The division has already formed a temporary air defense team, a fire fighting team, a traffic control team, and a patrol team, and is currently planning to implement special training in air defense and anti-poisoning. Starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th, a youth division training conference will be held at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse under the order of air defense training. In addition, a 500-member Baojia air defense corps specially organized in each district receives guidance and training from the Public Works Department fire brigade, the Baojia guidance department, and the traffic air defense section, and is a powerful organization together with the youth division.</p>
<p>During air defense drills, the concession area also attaches great importance to the formation of Baojia family air defense groups and makes continuous efforts, but it has not yet reached the level of the Japanese side in the Hongkou area and is still in an unfinished stage. Therefore, establishing family air defense groups will be an important task after the fourth drill. But what is most desired is that the cooperation between neighbors in the Baojia system in peacetime should be realized first, so that Baojia air defense can cooperate with each other in the event of an emergency. If the concession area fails to ensure more advanced Baojia cooperation that is more closely related to daily life than the current situation, it will be difficult to expect genuine air defense cooperation.</p>
<p>Training Adapted to Each District</p>
<p>The Public Works Department should adapt to the special geographical and other circumstances under the jurisdiction of each police station, and respect the unique environment of each district. The police station chief should not guide air defense drills apart from the actual life of the people under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Among the seven areas, the area with the best results in the past three drills is the Old Zhabei District. This is because this area has many shops, and the various air defense equipment fees are automatically raised by each Baojia, so it has achieved this result. The area in the office district under the jurisdiction of the Central Station is less successful. For example, in the Jing'an Temple Road area, most of the residents are intellectuals, and some who have studied in Japan guide air defense, so it is similar to the Japanese side's civilian air defense. In this way, each district has its own special conditions, and the Public Works Department should use great care to promote its advantages and remove its disadvantages.</p>
<p>The Active Role of the Fire Brigade</p>
<p>As a result of the three air defense drills, both the Japanese and Chinese sides have paid attention to organizing or have already successfully organized family air defense groups, and there are great expectations for the role of family air defense groups in fire prevention and fire extinguishing activities. However, once an accident occurs, family air defense groups alone are obviously not enough to extinguish the fire, so the Public Works Department fire brigade should play an active role.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for cooperation with the civilians during air raids, the Public Works Department fire brigade, in close cooperation with the traffic air defense section, the Baojia guidance department, etc., guides the Baojia self-defense corps in each district under its jurisdiction in their own and the public's fire extinguishing activities. In this drill, great expectations are placed on the activities of the fire brigade.</p>
<p>Strengthening Air Defense Propaganda</p>
<p>In the Public Works Department traffic section, a traffic propaganda team composed of Chinese people goes to factories, roads, and tea houses from time to time to conduct left-hand traffic and other traffic propaganda. This traffic propaganda team will be further expanded into a traffic air defense propaganda team to cultivate the concession residents' attention to civilian air defense.</p>
<p>More than half of the concession residents do not understand written propaganda, so direct oral propaganda is the most effective weapon. Therefore, the establishment of the traffic air defense team must rely on the Baojia system. According to the concession air defense guide, it is very dangerous to implement the same air defense propaganda on the concession residents as it is implemented on the Japanese in a mechanical way. For example, "An air raid is imminent now." This kind of propaganda can of course arouse the fighting spirit of the Japanese, but the impact on the Chinese people after the war will be linked to various rumors, creating a public mentality that "Because we are at war, there are air raids, so being at war is..." In implementing air defense work, it is necessary to put a lot of effort into research on propaganda.</p>
<p>Like this kind of painstaking effort in Sino-Japanese air defense cooperation, Japanese members of the self-defense corps in the Hongkou area have already experienced it, so they are not keen on ensuring superficial joint activities between Chinese and Japanese people. At the same time, they are also considering strengthening the psychological bond within the Chinese and Japanese people, and are taking the lead in practical activities to demonstrate with the determination to "let us set an example first."</p>
<p>Air Defense Drills Are Here Again</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, after repeated training, the time has come to give full play to the power of civilian air defense, to cooperate with the military authorities in air defense, and to fully fulfill our important tasks. Air defense drills will be held for four days starting from April 12. The period of this air defense drill is shorter than the previous one. If it were longer, the shortcomings in the early stage could be overcome in the later stage. But this drill is only four days, and the individual air defense drill is only the first two days. Therefore, before the start of the drill, we should first complete the technical and mental preparation, and try this drill with a particularly tense mood.

<h3>Air Defense Exercise Starts Today; Baojia Mobilized Day and Night; Special Attention Paid to Lookout Duties; Rescue and Fire Extinguishing Equipment to Be Overhauled</h3>
<p>Air defense drills will be held again in this city's area for four days starting today (the 12th). The methods have been promulgated separately by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters and the municipal government and the two concession authorities. Citizens must abide by the rules. The Baojia authorities have also ordered their subordinates to prepare for various air defense exercises. In the Public Concession, various preparations to be made are issued by each police station, and the self-defense corps air defense guidelines are roughly the same, including: (1) All air defense equipment, such as water tanks, yellow sand, cotton wool, straw mats, etc., must be fully prepared. (2) The following must be reorganized and reorganized: (A) lookout posts, (B) patrol teams, (C) traffic teams, (D) rescue teams, (E) fire brigades. Those Baojia who had incomplete organizations last winter should be supplemented as much as possible this time. (3) Designate rescue stations, shelters, and lookout post locations, and clearly mark them in front of the doors for identification. (4) Each Baojia should have at least three lookout posts, but if it is a department store such as Wing On Company, one is sufficient. (5) After the alert alarm is issued, the list of personnel in charge of the lookout should be sent to the police station through the Baojia in each district for record. (6) After the alert alarm is issued, those in charge of the lookout post duty should immediately go to the post to provide lookout service and must not leave their posts until the alert alarm is lifted. Each Bao should send the lookout location and the list of lookout personnel to the police station through the Baojia in each district for record. (7) After the alert alarm is issued, each Lianbao must send two liaison officers to the police station (daytime) and the Baojia room (night) for liaison. (8) During the air defense exercise period, self-defense corps members must be on duty day and night. (9) During the air defense exercise period, the Baojia personnel of each Lianbao office should be on duty and work day and night, and each Lianbao should be properly assigned (the police station Baojia Association will also work day and night). (10) Each Lianbao should send ten youth corps members to assist in the service, and the head of each Lianbao should consider the situation and assign and direct the work. (11) Each Lianbao will have day and night offices during the air defense exercise period, and the location and telephone number must be sent to the office. All measures must be followed by each Bao, and the fire control team, air defense security team, surveillance station (i.e. lookout team), air defense fire brigade, air defense liaison team, propaganda team, and health rescue team must be strictly overhauled and fully mobilized from today to take various measures. As for the French Concession, each Lianbao chief is responsible for convening the entire self-defense corps, fire brigade, rescue, etc., to implement air defense work from today, and the methods are the same as the column period.</p>
<p>Emergency Notice from the Municipal Police Bureau The Air Defense Guidance Department of the Municipal Police Headquarters has now issued an emergency notice ordering all police sub-bureaus in their respective districts to supervise and implement air defense training in two phases in accordance with the regulations of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters of friendly countries. The first phase is to implement individual air defense training based on guidance, and the second phase is to implement general air defense training.</p>
<p>Rescue The locations, equipment conditions, and numbers of all rescue stations and shelters set up within the city limits shall be reported by each police sub-bureau in advance. During the exercise period, each police sub-bureau must organize patrol teams and rescue teams. The number of people should be determined by each sub-bureau based on the complexity of the affairs.</p>
<p>Self-Defense The Nanshi Self-Defense Corps will also start air defense exercises and training on civilian air defense knowledge from today. Under the supervision of the concurrent commander Wang Delin, all sub-teams will be mobilized. The self-defense corps will be divided into patrol teams and will patrol the entire area after the alarm is activated, and will notify the Baojia chiefs. Starting yesterday, they will check the lighting control equipment door-to-door in advance. If Japanese residents in the district do not comply with the authorities' regulations to cover the lights during the exercise period, the sub-team leaders in charge will record the time, location, and door number in accordance with the instructions of Sugiyama, the captain of the Nanshi Military Police, and report to the friendly country for correction.</p>
<p>Fire Extinguishing Recently, a type of fire extinguishing bomb has been approved by the Commissioner of Police of the Public Works Department and can be purchased by citizens in each district. In order to understand its effectiveness, the Xinzhapu Baojia Committee once summoned all Baojia personnel in the district to Zhangyuan to participate in the fire extinguishing bomb exercise. Yesterday, the Xinzhapu Baojia District Committee distributed the fire extinguishing bombs to each Bao, with 30 to 40 pieces per Bao, and ordered them to be sold to each Jia and household. The price is 50 yuan per piece, but it is a voluntary purchase and not mandatory. The proceeds must be handed over to the District Committee for collection and transfer.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Air Defense Authorities</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice announcing that civilian air defense training will be held continuously for four days starting today (the 12th). Based on past experience, the air defense headquarters authorities made a special statement yesterday, hoping that all sectors will pay attention to the following matters and further strengthen sincere cooperation. (1) In view of the specificity of Shanghai, in order to achieve perfect civilian air defense, the cooperation and cooperation of all nations is extremely important, which goes without saying. It is hoped that each self-defense corps will make mutual efforts to practice the unity of all national minds, and never hinder the spirit of concerted cooperation due to temporary narrow emotions, and violate the original meaning of civilian air defense. (2) Regarding the composition of the self-defense corps air defense personnel and the activities of the family mass team, it is hoped that the self-defense corps will cooperate fully with various government offices and companies. Employees of government offices and various companies should be air defense personnel at their places of service, which goes without saying, but they must also provide guidance on air defense matters to the self-defense corps or family air defense teams. In addition to spiritual cooperation, government offices and various companies should, when necessary, dispatch personnel who are temporarily not hindering the current tasks to serve as air defense personnel of the self-defense corps or family air defense instructors to cooperate jointly in order to fully develop the effectiveness of activities. At the same time, it is hoped that the self-defense corps and family air defense groups will also make proper arrangements for their composition and training as soon as possible in order to achieve the goal of being able to fully operate without relying on these service personnel.</p>
<h3>Authorities Rectify Fire Administration; In View of Recent Fires, Dangerous Goods Will Be Prohibited; Unreasonable Housing Situations Will Also Be Banned; Newest Firefighting Equipment Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, Jing Shuiqing, the president of the Shanghai Fire Brigade, has strived to innovate the firefighting equipment of the fire administration and has also advised residents to improve their fire prevention equipment as much as possible.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Firefighting Equipment Arrives According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Fire Administration recently transported a large batch of firefighting equipment from other places. It is found that this firefighting equipment, including automatic steel ladders and water jet cages, are all newly manufactured and are very effective in firefighting. At 7:30 yesterday morning, the Fire Administration personnel tested them near the Park Hotel on Park Road, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Normal Equipment Is Considered Insufficient At the same time, it is also heard that the Fire Brigade authorities expressed great regret for the fire that occurred on Guizhou Road, which resulted in more than 30 casualties. Although the firefighters made every effort to put out the fire at that time, they were ultimately unable to put it out immediately. The Fire Administration authorities believe that the lesson of this time is entirely due to the lack of thorough fire prevention equipment for the people at ordinary times. It also said that there were too many residents in the building, so many people did not hear the news and escape when the fire broke out.</p>
<p>Prohibit the Storage of Dangerous Goods In view of this, in addition to making every effort to innovate fire administration affairs, the authorities will pay close attention to residents' fire prevention equipment in the future and will conduct a large-scale investigation of the storage of dangerous goods, and ban the situation where there are few houses and many people, and other unreasonable housing situations.</p>
<h3>Municipal Grain Bureau Allots Special Rice at 375 Yuan Per Bag</h3>
<p>The Municipal Grain Bureau has been ordered to be reorganized this time in order to adapt to the wartime food system, and the internal personnel have also been adjusted separately, resulting in the delay of the special allocation of community food rice last month. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the Grain Bureau has allocated this rice according to the determined quantity. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to each community to quickly pay the money and issue the rice. The previous price was 315 yuan per bag, plus a hemp bag guarantee of 50 yuan each. After the household rice price changed, the price of this rice was also re-regulated by the bureau to 375 yuan per bag, plus the hemp bag guarantee.</p>
<h3>Population Entry and Exit in the French Concession; Householders Must Not Conceal; If Jia Chief Obtains Information and Reports, Lianbao Chief Shall Be Fully Responsible</h3>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation with the French authorities, citizens entering and exiting the concession must immediately apply for a travel permit and report to the police station. If the householder conceals or delays the report, he shall be severely punished. If the Jia chief has obtained information and reports it to the Lianbao office, the Lianbao chief shall be fully responsible for the responsibility.</p>
<h3>Coal Jin to Be Rationed Again</h3>
<p>The coal jin of spot goods required daily by each coal retailer has been allocated by the Dazhong Lian Coal Company in accordance with the regulations. It is now learned that the Dazhong Lian Coal Company will schedule the distribution of the ninth batch of coal jin again, designating three types: (1) Yangquan lumps, (2) Liuquan lumps, and (3) Dashan lumps. As for the selling price per ton, the total allocation of tons, and the amount that each household should receive, they are still being negotiated separately and will be officially decided within the day. The reporter also learned from another source that the source of raw materials (coal fines) used to make coal balls is still continuously on the way, mostly from production areas such as Korea. The production of spot goods in each factory is the same as in the past, and the manufacturing cost has not increased, so the relevant authorities will earnestly implement the standard price limit for coal balls, which is 25 yuan per dan (100kg) in Central Reserve Notes.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Clearing Operation Launched; Pickpockets Arrested and Deported; Large Number of Thieves Released from Huade Road Prison; Main Reason for Recent Rampant Pickpocketing</h3>
<p>In order to decide to drive pickpockets out of the Public Concession, the Police Department launched a pickpocket clearing operation yesterday. Colorful slogans were posted in various public places, and a large number of plainclothes detectives were dispatched to investigate pickpocketing activities in the concession.</p>
<p>Determine to Let Residents Understand Prevention According to the Police Department Director, after this pickpocket clearing operation, all pickpockets will be arrested. The scope of this operation by the police is much wider than the last one, not just posting slogans on the walls, but also determining that all Shanghai residents can understand effective methods of pickpocketing prevention.</p>
<p>Tram Company Cooperates Jointly</p>
<p>It is pointed out that for some people who want to try their pickpocketing skills, the authorities are holding this clearing operation to warn them of their vile psychology. It is also learned that the Shanghai Tram Company and other groups and agencies have been notified by the police to cooperate jointly in strictly preventing the activities of petty thieves.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Theft Cases Main Reason</p>
<p>Regarding the sudden increase in pickpocketing cases, the Police Department Director explained that the main reason is that a large number of thieves were recently released from Huade Road Prison. Because these people have served their sentences, they have no way to make a living after being released, so they engage in this kind of activity. Although, the losses suffered by those who encounter pickpocketing are usually only between ten yuan and one hundred yuan, and at most no more than five hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers' Union Congress</h3>
<p>The term of office of the first board of directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Special City Dockworkers' Union has expired. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, the second representative congress was held in the assembly hall of the union at No. 31, Dajiamen Bajiqiao Street, to re-elect in accordance with the regulations. More than 1,300 guests and worker representatives from various districts attended. Bai Xiaolan and others were the presidium, discussing and revising the charter, stipulating that August 31 of each year is the anniversary of the founding of the union, and April 16 of each year is the anniversary of the martyrs of the dockworkers. Then, the election of directors and supervisors was held and the meeting was adjourned at 5:00.</p>
<h3>Women's Welfare Association Holds Sino-Japanese Women's Forum; Mayor Chen's Wife Expresses Her Opinions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Welfare Association held a Sino-Japanese women's forum yesterday at the Lido Ballroom Tea Room. Mayor Chen's wife, Ambassador Li Fang's wife, Mrs. Li Zuyu, and Ms. Tsuruno Haruno, the president of the East Asian Women's Association of the friendly country, and more than 60 members of the association attended. First, President Zhao Wenyi reported on the recent work situation. Then, Mayor Chen's wife expressed her opinions on promoting the work, with a total of three points: (1) running compulsory schools, (2) running nurseries to seek welfare for working women, and (3) establishing orphanages. Next, Ms. Tsuruno Haruno, the president of the East Asian Women's Association of Japan, raised the issue of how to cooperate between Chinese and Japanese women. Subsequently, Mrs. Li Zuyu and Ambassador Li Fang's wife expressed their opinions on the above points. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00.</p>
<h3>Lequn and Other Schools Approved to Be Exempt from Eviction; Teachers and Students Still Teach and Study at the Original Location</h3>
<p>School building disputes have been occurring frequently in this city recently. Lequn Middle School, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School, Wuxi National Studies College, and Zhengyang Middle School on Avenue Road had recently been ordered by the court to evacuate on April 1, causing panic among the schools. In view of this, Zhou Huarren, the secretary-general of the Municipal Education Association, sent a telegram to Minister Luo of the Ministry of Justice to maintain education and handle the matter impartially. It is now confirmed that the request has been approved. Teachers and students of Lequn and other schools are still teaching and studying at the original location with peace of mind. The entire education community is inspired by the enthusiasm of the association.</p>
<h3>Chongming Levies Two Taxes</h3>
<p>Chongming District has recently levied two taxes. One is the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's paper business tax, which has appointed Zhao Huimin as the director to set up a collection office in Chongming. All kinds of paper transported and sold by boats, vehicles, and merchants and factories shall be subject to a tax rate of 10%. The other is the banquet donation handled by the Tax Administration Office under the order of the government, which has been contracted by the merchant Wei Guozhen and will start collecting from today.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association Expands Scope</h3>
<p>The members of the Municipal Education Association were previously limited to schools in the special zone. Recently, since the Education Commission was ordered to close, the municipal education administration has been unified. The Education Association, which is responsible for education design and improvement, should be expanded. For the purpose of gathering ideas, the president specially selected 14 principals of municipal schools who have the best results and the deepest qualifications to join as members of the Education Association. In addition to appointing Chen Keying and other five people as members of the association, Chen Zuxing and other nine people were also hired as advisory committee members.</p>
<h3>Tea Server at Jai Alai Stadium Falls to Death</h3>

<h3>Sports Western Union First Division Football Donghua Wins Big Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the Western Union First Division football match, Donghua met Suko for the first time at Jiaozhou Park at 10:30 yesterday morning. The Suko team played with ten players. Donghua Aquire was also wrong, and Han Longhai took charge of the central army. At the sound of the whistle, the five forwards of Donghua advanced. At seven minutes, Youliang penetrated from the right and sent it to the middle. Cao Qinfang calmly shot and opened the scoring (1-0). At 40 minutes, Youliang got a corner kick opportunity and kicked it perfectly. Qinfang pulled the shot and hit the crossbar and bounced back. Li Yao headed it in (2-0). Before long, the first half ended, with Donghua leading 2-0. After the change of ends, Donghua had the wind behind them, and the offensive became more and more sharp. At 15 minutes, Longhai got the ball and lightly passed it to Li Zhuang. Li dribbled the ball into the net (3-0). Three minutes later, Li Dongshan rose again, penetrated from the left wing, raised his foot and cut and shot. The Suko goalkeeper patted the ball into the net, playing a comedy of betrayal (4-0). Afterwards, the Suko team pulled back a goal (4-1), and Donghua Wei Yao shot another goal (5-1). Five minutes before the end of the game, Cao Qinfang also scored (6-1). When the time was up, Donghua defeated Saint Francis by a score of 6-1.</p>

<h3>Short Commentary: Air Defense Drills are Our Own Business</h3>
<p>Starting today, the city will hold four consecutive days of air defense drills. The authorities have already promulgated regulations and announced that citizens must strictly abide by them.</p>
<p>"Air defense drills," this is already the fourth time. Everyone has a further understanding of the technical and mental preparations for air defense. Therefore, the results of this drill should show progress compared to the previous ones.</p>
<p>Our Shanghai is an important city in a wartime country. In the sense of war, it is very likely to suffer enemy air raids. There is no need to avoid talking about this, nor is it alarmist. However, the fact that there have been no air raids to this day is fortunate. In order to cope with real air raids, continuous drills are needed. If everyone has air defense knowledge and the ability to remain calm in the event of an emergency, the damage and loss during air raids can be reduced.</p>
<p>Do not think that the drills are "fake" and therefore not care or follow the rules. Without the experience of mock drills, there is no skill to cope with real air raids.</p>
<p>Most importantly, "air defense" should be regarded as something that concerns every citizen personally, rather than something extra that military and political authorities force us to do. We must understand this point and participate in air defense drills with the mentality of "doing something for ourselves," accepting all the rules that should be followed.</p>
<h3>Economic Sector</h3>
<p>The Japanese government, for the second time funding the development of the Southern Gold Treasury, recently issued 50 million yuan of 3.5% public bonds. The Japanese government's investment in the Jin Kang (Gold Treasury) has reached 60 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Thorough Investigation of Speculation Targets</h3>
<p>The National Government's clear order to severely investigate hoarding can be said to be a major event in the economic sector, and even a sensational event, because the focus of this investigation is the economic sector itself - "major officials of financial institutions engaged in speculative trading."</p>
<p>We often hear people say that a certain place hoards daily necessities with a total value exceeding tens of thousands of yuan in currency, that a certain place hoards edible oil sufficient for the entire population of Shanghai for several years, and that a certain place hoards soap sufficient for the entire population of Shanghai for several years. The basis of these rumors, of course, cannot be confirmed, but whether they can be brought to light depends entirely on whether the personnel in charge of the investigation prioritize law over personal relationships.</p>
<p>Speaking of the targets of this investigation into hoarding, we know that financial institutions are the main body, but to do it strictly and effectively, attention should be paid to the targets within this target. Assuming it is a bank, its warehouses and factories must be investigated, and its cargo yards must be investigated. Insurance companies must investigate their warehouse policyholders. Key employees must investigate the warehouses with which they have dealings, and even the residences of themselves and their relatives and friends. These are all targets within the target.</p>
<p>Only such an investigation method can be considered thorough, and the results of such a thorough investigation would be: (1) Those who have already hoarded will find it difficult to escape the law, (2) Those who are hoarding will collapse at the mere sight of trouble, (3) Those who are preparing to hoard will lose their color in fear, and the overall result will be the eradication of hoarding and the stabilization of commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Thoroughly Stabilizes Prices, Strictly Investigates Speculation and Manipulation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In view of the ever-increasing commodity prices in the city, which seem to have no end, although this is caused by general businesses privately raising prices and creating black markets, the biggest reason is actually hoarding. These hoarders, whether they are merchants or private individuals, speculate and manipulate, monopolize the market, and fuel prices, harming businesses and people, which is extremely hateful. It is heard that the Municipal Economic Bureau regards suppressing and stabilizing prices as an important task at present. To solve the problem at its root, it is necessary to crack down on hoarders. It has already sent personnel to conduct strict investigations. Once they are discovered, they will be punished in accordance with central laws and regulations. At the same time, it will reward citizens who know the facts and report them. If the reports are verified, rewards will be given according to regulations. The bureau believes that this case is a fundamental strategy for suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and hopes that all citizens of the city will provide as much assistance as possible.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Promotes Wartime Food Control and Distribution</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency): After the National Government joined the war, in view of the importance of food in wartime, the Food Management Committee was reorganized into the Ministry of Food, which is responsible for the production, management, and distribution of food throughout the country. Since its establishment, the Ministry has made many plans for food administration. A Central News Agency reporter visited Vice Minister Zhou the other day to inquire about wartime food issues, production controls, distribution, and consumption. Vice Minister Zhou provided very detailed answers.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Speculation and Hoarding, Banks Cautiously Handling Collateral Loans, Loan Transactions Must Be Reported to Authorities</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly crack down on speculation and hoarding, the government has dispatched Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, and others to thoroughly investigate loans from various banks and businesses. At the same time, in order to prevent the use of commodities as collateral for financing, all banks and money houses are seriously implementing the new loan methods agreed upon by the United Association of Banks and Money Houses. The collateral of borrowers is limited to those that do not violate current laws and regulations and do not promote hoarding and speculation. The selection of collateral, valuation discounts, and other factors are particularly carefully considered. The term is negotiated by both parties depending on the nature of the collateral, but must not exceed three months. It is also limited to members of trade associations, factories, companies, and businesses. All banks and businesses must report the following items to the trade association for submission to the competent authorities for record when providing collateral for goods: (1) The name of the borrower's company or business and the name of its representative; (2) The amount of the loan; (3) The term of the loan; (4) The name and quantity of the collateral; (5) The location of the collateral storage; (6) The registration number of the borrower's company or business, or proof of membership in the relevant trade association. In addition, the United Reserve Committee of Banks and the United Reserve Treasury of Money Houses have tightened the lending of funds to member banks and businesses. Applicants must explain the legitimate purpose before acceptance is approved. The term of lending must not exceed ten days. For those providing collateral with assets, each bank or business is limited to 25% of the total amount approved by the association.</p>
<h3>Exchange Between Mengjiang and Central China Adopts Special Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 11th (Central News Agency): The exchange settlement between Mengjiang and Central China used to be based on military notes. Now, because Central China and South China have stopped issuing military notes, it has been changed to two types of settlement methods: Central Reserve Notes and Special Yuan. However, for convenience, the Mengjiang side is adopting the same special settlement method as Manchuria. After consultations with the Central China side, both parties have recently reached an understanding. Therefore, from now on, the trade and non-trade receipts and payments between Mengjiang and Central China will all be settled in Special Yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions Last Week Gradually Declined, Credit Tightened, and Overnight Lending Rates Rose</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: Shanghai's financial, industrial, and market conditions last week gradually declined under the strict implementation of controls by the authorities. Some daily necessities saw price increases. The reason for this is nothing more than the manipulation of speculators and hoarders. However, after the government ordered personnel to come to Shanghai to investigate speculative trading and hoarding merchants on Wednesday, illegal merchants panicked and sought to unload their goods. Moreover, banks and money houses refused to provide collateral loans, credit tightened, and the market showed a situation of oversupply. Prices became increasingly soft. Interbank lending rates rose to two cents. It is heard that black markets in various industries completely stopped in the second half of the week, and the official prices of various goods remained stable.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Remit Funds to Their Home Country, Limited to 50 Vietnamese Dong Per Person</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency): Regarding the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese in Vietnam to their home country, after negotiations between the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam and the Vietnamese authorities, it has been stipulated that the Zhongnan Company will carry out liaison work under the supervision of the Japanese Embassy, and then the remittances will be formally sent by the Yokohama Specie Bank. The limit is 50 Vietnamese Dong per person. The total amount of the first batch of remittances totaled 17,400 yuan in Central Reserve Notes. This amount was remitted to Guangzhou in early March. The remittance limit was further increased to 300,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. The military notes recently remitted through Yokohama Specie Bank have reached 23,106.5 yuan, including 16,426 yuan for Guangzhou, 757 yuan for Hong Kong, 4,087 yuan for Shantou, 1,369 yuan for Xiamen, and 485 yuan for Shanghai. Amounts less than one yuan are not included.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

Other staff members have also been determined, and various preparations have been completed. Business began on the morning of the 10th inside the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Paper goods are produced in Fuyang, with yellow and white types. The quality of each material varies, so the selling price is also different. Sales are quite extensive, especially during the spring when merchants come to Hangzhou to purchase, so the market situation has been particularly brisk recently.</p>

<h3>Reactions to the Thorough Investigation of Speculation and Hoarding</h3>
<p>Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, Yuan Yuguai, Vice Minister of Industry, and others who were entrusted by the National Government to come to Shanghai with the important task of thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, immediately began their investigation work after arriving in Shanghai. They have completed the investigation of bank account books and began inspecting insurance companies on the 10th. It is expected that inspections of business companies will begin around the 11th. As of now, the preliminary investigation results and the reactions of the financial and industrial circles in the concession are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Results of Inspection of Financial Institutions and Their Reactions</p>
<p>The results of the inspection of the clearing house on the 4th and the inspection of financial institutions on the 9th revealed that some banks had paid huge checks for hoarding materials. It is reported that some large banks related to important political figures are included. How the National Government will deal with this has become the focus of public attention. If the relationship banks that occupy an important position in politics issue checks for the purpose of purchasing materials and ignore them by political pretext, and only a few ordinary Chinese merchant banks are punished, then it is expected that considerable waves will be caused in the Shanghai financial community. What the financial community hopes and advocates now is that instead of cleaning up the private economic sector, it is better to clean up the large financial institutions with government power as their background.</p>
<p>(2) Impact on Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Since the order from the chairman to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding was issued, the trend of soaring commodity prices has been corrected, and the upward trend has stopped for a while. It is generally believed that this is due to the financial institutions stopping or reducing the issuance of checks for the purpose of hoarding goods. The current high commodity prices are not solely caused by currency inflation. The fundamental reason lies in the purchase and hoarding by a part of the force. At the same time, most people believe that if this thorough investigation only cleans up the local private economy and ends there, then commodity prices will rebound. In terms of price policy, it is hoped that there will be a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>(3) Handling of Business Companies, etc.</p>
<p>How to thoroughly investigate and deal with the business companies that are dominated by Shanghai financial giants and have close relations with important figures in the National Government is what the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles are most concerned about. At a time when production is sluggish, the emerging financial cliques in Shanghai have successively established enterprise groups and various business companies, forming separate units of financial institutions. In order to defend themselves, their combination with political figures cannot necessarily be determined to be improper, but when they combine with political forces and become speculative activity groups that hinder the stability of people's livelihoods, they must not be ignored in the policy of restoring Shanghai's economy. The authorities have successively established financial inspection agencies and insurance administrations to supervise financial institutions and insurance companies, but the business companies between finance and enterprise are still allowed to be established like bamboo shoots after a rain. If it is said that all should be restricted, it is also inappropriate in terms of the current situation of the concession's financial industry. Therefore, everyone hopes that unsound business companies should be dealt with decisively.</p>
<p>(4) Comprehensive Reaction</p>
<p>As a result, this incident has given the general public in the concession an unexpected and profound reaction. People believe that if this thorough investigation is half-hearted and ends hastily, then the economic policy of the National Government, which has worked so hard to establish the National Commercial Control General Association and wants to embark on the path of national capital's autonomous mobilization, will encounter obstacles, and it is feared that in the worst-case scenario, it will also promote political and economic confrontation between the government and the people. Therefore, at this moment, the National Government should take the "spirit of self-condemnation" shown by Chairman Wang to carry out a major political purge. This is what the economic circles in the concession earnestly pray for. (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 11th Dalu Xinbao)</p>
<h3>Translated Commentary: The Key to Cracking Down on Speculation</h3>
<p>After the National Government's order to investigate speculation was announced, the investigation of banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc. began. Although this move has been delayed, it should still be encouraged and welcomed. The National Government has stated that anyone who engages in hoarding and speculation, poisons society, and disrupts the market, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, will be severely punished, and they have quickly begun to implement this. Everyone is willing to applaud the National Government's strict and impartial attitude.</p>
<p>There is an unknown amount of speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, and it is impossible to quickly resolve it all at once. However, whether these purchases and hoarding are directly carried out by banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc., or are carried out by private individuals through banks, insurance companies, business companies, etc. is a very clear fact. However, it is a well-known fact that these speculators have strong political backgrounds and openly disregard the public orders of the Public Works Department and others. How easy is it to crack down on speculation without the direct intervention of the National Government? Fortunately, the National Government announced an order to investigate and punish and immediately began the investigation. Judging from the current situation of speculative activities in Shanghai, this is a very appropriate measure.</p>
<p>The key to cracking down on speculation is to impartially punish anyone who engages in large-scale speculation, hoards important materials, poisons society, and disrupts the market, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians. If some are punished and others escape, speculation cannot be completely eradicated. The people responsible for the thorough investigation are all experienced and knowledgeable people, and they are also people with high reputations. However, they have considerable relationships with the Shanghai financial community. Once they act impartially and without favoritism, they will inevitably be resented and scolded. Therefore, they must first have a spirit of self-condemnation, break through personal relationships, and think deeply, so that no one who commits crimes escapes the law. Similarly, speculative elements should not be allowed to enjoy impunity and become rich, while others are imprisoned and subjected to sanctions alone. They should be treated impartially and in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is another point that should be considered, that is, the investigation must be thorough. Looking back at the results of previous crackdowns on speculation, most of them were half-hearted and ended without results. At the beginning, the momentum was fierce, but in the end, nothing was gained. If this thorough investigation of speculation repeats the same mistake, it must be understood that its negative repercussions will be extremely serious. It is better not to crack down on speculation than to fail to achieve its effect and instead induce large-scale speculation, leading to an irreparable end. Just like commodity prices, merchants adjust their prices according to the noise about cracking down on speculation. If the noise is tight, the price is low, and if the noise is loose, the price rises. The actual situation of the crackdown gives speculators opportunities and psychology, and there is a risk of causing commodity prices to rebound. Those in charge of the thorough investigation should consider this point.</p>
<p>Because of the vigorous crackdown on speculation, it is expected that some gaps will inevitably arise between the Shanghai financial community, especially national capital, and the National Government. However, this is an unavoidable transitional phenomenon and must be forgiven in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. However, it should be noted that the crackdown and investigation must be fair and strict, so that national capital is in awe of the fairness of the crackdown. It is worth mentioning the dignity of the law. The crackdown should be implemented fairly, strictly, thoroughly, and with emphasis on the law rather than personal relationships. This is what we deeply hope for from the National Government. (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 11th Dalu Xinbao)</p>

<h3>The Child's Spring</h3>
<p>— Zu Ren</p>
<p>The silk reeling machine roared, like a monster crouching on the ground. A ten-horsepower motor dragged its gears, and it performed its task with a clattering roar.</p>
<p>A Yuan was responsible for managing it. At this time, he was grabbing handfuls of waste silk with his small hands and carefully feeding them into the monster's mouth. He watched the waste silk slowly swallowed, swallowed, and finally completely swallowed up. He then put down the second handful, the third, the fourth... Handfuls, this monster was like it would never be satisfied.</p>
<p>He had been mingling with this monster for several years, so the surprise and curiosity he felt when he first saw it gradually faded with the long years. His good feelings for it gradually decreased. He felt it was too selfish and did not consider his fatigue at all, just greedily opening its mouth all day long, requiring him to feed its never-filling stomach for twelve hours a day, without stopping for a moment. He gradually felt ordinary, tired, and disappointed with his work.</p>
<p>He sometimes simply hated it, because he felt that since he had been close to it, his plump face had gradually become thin, and his blood-red complexion had gradually become pale. What made him most uncomfortable was the wool shavings flying all over the room. Although he wore a mask, he would still inhale them into his nostrils, which were itchy and uncomfortable. His jet-black hair had also turned gray. His clothes never had a clean day.</p>
<p>Especially the ruthless factory regulations had exploited him and deprived him of his inherent innocence and liveliness. Although he was still a child, he had completely lost the activity that a child should have.</p>
<p>In the dim light, he looked out through the window hole with his no longer flexible eyes. Outside, it was an enticing spring season. Kites of various colors were flying in the blue sky. In the sunshine, there must be many lucky children jumping!</p>
<p>The kites were high! Far away! They took away A Yuan's fixed gaze.</p>
<p>The warm wind in March revealed the news of spring and also awakened A Yuan's heart, which had lost the breath of childhood. He said softly, "It's spring!"</p>
<p>Yes! It's spring! But here, spring has long been lost. The dim light, the turbid air, combined with the dull breath of the silk reeling machine, did not have a trace of the vitality of spring, nor any of the joy of spring. It was always so sad.</p>
<p>Spring is for children, but A Yuan does not have spring.</p>
<h3>Remembering Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Occasionally, one or two cotton-like white clouds drift across the pale blue sky. In the afternoon, the sun shines lazily.</p>
<p>Sometimes a gentle breeze blows, and no one can tell where it comes from or where it goes, only that there is a soft, fluffy feeling on their faces, like a piece of velvet brushing past.</p>
<p>The pond by the railway wrinkles lazily.</p>
<p>Then one smells a fragrance of wildflowers drifting from the other side of the railway, with a hint of fishiness.</p>
<p>The weather is neither cold nor hot; it is a very pleasant spring.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong spent a long time searching for Jin Di by the fence at the entrance of the park. She was gazing intently through the fence, as if watching a peep show!</p>
<p>"Jin Di! Mom wants you to come back! You'll be going across the bridge with Dad later!"</p>
<p>"Sister! Come and look!" Jin Di didn't hear Xiao Hong.</p>
<p>"What's so interesting!" Xiao Hong pouted like an adult.</p>
<p>On a lawn inside the fence, twenty or thirty children were gathered in a large circle. Two female teachers stood in the middle, gesticulating and lecturing, but Xiao Hong couldn't hear what they were saying. She only saw them clapping their hands, singing, laughing and holding hands, walking around in a circle... The two children didn't speak, silently watching, watching.</p>
<p>"Sister!" Jin Di couldn't help but speak first, "If only we could go in and play one day!"</p>
<p>Ignoring her sister, she suddenly remembered her mother's words, "Let's go! Let's go back! You have to go to Zhoujiaqiao to sell rice with Dad!"</p>
<p>Jin Di still didn't hear. She turned around and watched a large group of people getting off a military vehicle. A girl about eleven or twelve years old, about the same age as Xiao Hong, wearing a red dress and holding her one-year-old brother in a green woolen sweater, was walking towards them.</p>
<p>"It would be so nice if Mao Tou wasn't thrown away!" Looking at the receding figure, Xiao Hong thought of the baby brother who was just born yesterday and was taken away by her father: "Next time we can also take him to the park, sit on the grass, sing, play,..."</p>
<p>"Really! Dad is so strange!" Jin Di also became sad: "It's such a shame to throw away such a good little Mao Tou, really!"</p>
<p>"Dad said it's strange that he was born at the wrong time. Who told him to be born into our family?... He said, in these times..."</p>
<p>"Xiao Hong!... Jin Di!..." Gen Di ran over from behind: "I, I've been looking for you for a long time! Your mother is calling you back!... There are so many people in the park today!... Do you know why?..."</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Xiao Hong and Jin Di widened their eyes at the same time.</p>
<p>"I asked Old Man Yang at the park entrance. He said today is some kind of Children's Day, and all the elementary school students in Shanghai have come to the park for a meeting!"</p>
<p>"Children's Day?" Jin Di asked, not understanding, "What Children's Day?"</p>
<p>"Never mind that! Let's go back! Mom will scold us again in a bit!" Xiao Hong was the first to run.</p>
<p>Jin Di bumped into an adult by accident.</p>
<p>"Little devil! Little rascal! May someone die in your house!"</p>
<p>She ran into her own roadside shack in one breath. Her father had already returned and was packing peanuts for a customer. Her mother was sitting on the bed sewing a small "safety jacket" for Jin Di.</p>
<p>"Little devil! Where did you die!" Her mother, who had just given birth, didn't even have the strength to scold people: "Those who are called don't come, and those who are calling aren't here!"</p>
<p>"Mom!" Jin Di hurriedly told her mother what she had seen. "Mom! There are so many people in the park today! Today is some kind of... Children's Day, and all the students in Shanghai are lining up to come, and there are so many..."</p>
<p>"None of your business!" Her mother seemed unwilling to listen: "They have money, of course they can celebrate any holiday! You! You don't have that luck!... Quickly take off your cotton coat and put this on! Go buy rice with your dad!"</p>
<p>"Mom!" Jin Di unbuttoned her cotton coat. "Can I go to the park one day too?... With my sister, Gen Di, Hua Zi,..."</p>
<p>"Get lost!" Her father, who had been waiting impatiently beside her, said: "You're dreaming! Do we belong in those places?... I'm telling you, you have a bad fate; you have to help the adults with work! Like Xiao Hong, she knows how to do business. Gen Di is only one year older than you, and he's already selling rice with his dad. You, at eight or nine years old, still only know how to run around all day long!"</p>
<p>"I can also pack peanuts!..." Jin Di pouted and walked onto the road with her father.</p>
<p>"Are there a lot of people at the park entrance? Xiao Hong!" Her mother suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"A lot!" Xiao Hong replied excitedly: "Many, many times more than usual!"</p>
<p>"Bring the basket! Take some peanuts and beans to sell!"</p>
<p>"Business will definitely be good!" Xiao Hong couldn't wait for her mother to tell her this; "But, there's no one at home, I'll go call Gen Di..."</p>
<p>"No need! You go! I'll get up!" Her mother propped herself up from the bed.</p>
<p>Seeing that her mother's eyes were swollen again, Xiao Hong guessed that her mother must have cried again. Really! Even Xiao Hong wanted to cry. Yesterday morning, the adorable baby brother was born, but Dad and Mom whispered for a while and then he took him away. After a while, Dad came back empty-handed, and Mom cried and cried - she must have cried again just now!</p>
<p>It would be so nice if she could also carry her brother on her back like Gen Di, and go around to the east and west, and have people say, "Look! Their little Mao Tou is so chubby!"... (To be continued in the next issue)</p>
<h3>Undutiful Children</h3>
<p>— Fang Qiong</p>
<p>Uncle Hu Zi was truly angry today; he didn't even eat dinner, standing at the back door staring straight at the sky. He didn't care about the noisy clamor in this small street alley; he only looked at the thin clouds racing across the horizon, silently shaking his head, looking defeated as if he was recalling something. He stood there like that, standing and standing, until the night quietly emerged from the east like a gray wolf, leaving the elongated shadows of dusk in the human realm like footprints, before he finally returned to the room.</p>
<p>He couldn't bear to stay in the room; here it was empty and silent, making it seem even more damp and dim, emitting waves of moldy odor; he paced around the room, unable to sit still, and finally he gently knocked on my door and pushed it open, coming in.</p>
<p>"Uncle, come in and sit down! Have you had dinner?"</p>
<p>I knew he had been feeling down recently, especially today when he got angry with his children at lunchtime. So I happily welcomed him.</p>
<p>He nodded slightly to me and sat down heavily on the large wooden stool opposite me. He stared straight at the books I had spread out on the table in front of me; he seemed a little regretful that he had bothered me. I understood what he meant, and I said obediently:</p>
<p>"After dinner, you should take a walk and relax. It's great that you came!"</p>
<p>"You're good, you're really diligent! You're always reading and writing at home..."</p>
<p>"If there's nothing else to do, I can only read books, it's stifling!"</p>
<p>"With a girl like you, parents should be very blessed! You're smart, talented, and will have a bright future!"</p>
<p>"You flatter me, Uncle Hu Zi. Your Xiù Qín, Mǐn Shēng, and little Hú Táo..."</p>
<p>"Don't mention them anymore. Those aren't children; they're just a bunch of debt collectors."</p>
<p>As he spoke, his expression was filled with endless resentment, and his long whiskers fluttered beneath his nose with each breath. I understood his state of mind, but I ended up saying the wrong thing. At this moment, I felt at a loss as to how to comfort him.</p>
<p>Uncle Hu Zi's family consisted of two daughters and one son. Before the war, they lived in a peaceful hometown, but after fleeing to Shanghai that year, they barely managed to survive. Gradually, the family of four's life became unable to withstand the endless cycle of rising prices, and they began to fall apart.</p>
<p>"Our family is the richest and most famous clan in XX, our status is almost worthy of being recorded in history books, tracing back nearly thirty years. You now..."</p>
<p>Uncle Hu Zi had scolded his children with these words more than once or twice, but his eldest daughter, Xiù Qín, shrugged her shoulders and replied to him:</p>
<p>"Who cares about that? We don't have any money to use right now!"</p>
<p>So she put on some powder and lipstick, dressed flamboyantly, and went out.</p>
<p>His son, Mǐn Shēng, didn't look like his father, nor did he look like his sister. He didn't talk much at home, but when he did, he would spout a whole string of grand principles. When he heard his father's scolding, he smiled at him:</p>
<p>"Dad, this isn't a glorious process. All of this should be buried in the past years forever, forever forgotten."</p>
<p>The father didn't understand what his son was babbling about and looked at him in confusion. But he only felt that his son wasn't his own either, and was just as disobedient, never home all day.</p>
<p>Little Hú Táo was a fifteen-year-old girl, innocent and lively. She could listen to her sister's words and dress up, or she could be influenced by her brother's group of friends to choose a different path in life from her sister. So little Hú Táo was either with her sister or out and about with her brother.</p>
<p>The three children were all running wild like hares in March, never to be seen.</p>
<p>In less than half a month, Uncle Hu Zi officially heard these words:</p>
<p>"Xiù Qín is working as a dance hostess at the XX dance hall!"</p>
<p>The news made his heart clench in his chest as if it was being squeezed by a pair of pliers, leaving him breathless. Today, as lunchtime was approaching, Uncle Hu Zi warned his children:</p>
<p>"You're not allowed to go out from now on! I want you to sit at home, none of you are allowed to leave!"</p>
<p>"What are we supposed to do at home?" Xiù Qín was fiery, and her words were full of anger from the moment they left her mouth.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to do anything. Read some books at home, haven't you studied before?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you want to be refined now! Where are the books you threw away? I don't have that kind of luck. If there's nothing to eat, are we supposed to gnaw on books?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to become a dance hostess to survive?"</p>
<p>"If it can help me survive, isn't that good enough?"</p>
<p>"Shameless, shameless..."</p>
<p>"If hunger is coiling around your neck like a giant snake, are you going to pretend to care about books and family status..."</p>
<p>Father and daughter argued more and more fiercely without holding back. Mǐn Shēng, however, took out the food and ate by himself. In Sun Tzu's Art of War, speed is paramount, and he planned to sneak out the door during the commotion. But suddenly, a voice rang out towards his corner:</p>
<p>"Mǐn Shēng, don't run off as soon as you're done eating; you're never at home, where do you go all day?"</p>
<p>Mǐn Shēng glanced at his father, but didn't respond. It wasn't that he was timid, but rather that he skillfully avoided those sharp words.</p>
<p>After this argument, Xiù Qín simply didn't eat her meal. She washed her face, put on makeup, dressed up for a while, and ran out. Mǐn Shēng took little Hú Táo and quietly slipped out the back door as well. Uncle Hu Zi watched their backs, panting. His breathing came hoarsely from his chest, like wind passing through a blacksmith's bellows. No matter how angry he was, he couldn't keep this group of stubborn, undutiful children from leaving.</p>
<p>He never understood that his children, like old snakes, were shedding their skin in the midst of suffering and distress, shedding that old, wrinkled, colorless outer layer. But they were each moving forward along their own paths in life—this was what each of them had silently decided and what shone clearly in the gloomy light of their hungry eyes, regardless of whether they were choosing a smooth road or a dirty trap!</p>
<h3>Father's Hair Has Turned White — One of the Undecided Drafts</h3>
<p>— Shǐ Tíng</p>
<p>Father's hair has turned gray,</p>
<p>Like withered grass on the wilderness</p>
<p>Eroded by deep autumn;</p>
<p>It can no longer cover his balding head,</p>
<p>His gray hair is too sparse!</p>
<p>Under the dim yellow light</p>
<p>They shimmer with a dull glow,</p>
<p>I silently count his years—</p>
<p>He is only forty-three years old!</p>
<p>He forces himself to write,</p>
<p>Struggling to pry open</p>
<p>Those tightly stuck eyelids,</p>
<p>I see in his eyes</p>
<p>Filled with blood!</p>
<p>Casting a pleading light towards me,</p>
<p>This pleading gaze!</p>
<p>Awakens endless memories;—</p>
<p>I still remember:</p>
<p>Father's hair has turned white,</p>
<p>The hair of his soul has also</p>
<p>Turned gray!</p>
<p>But, with what shall I</p>
<p>Receive that pleading light,</p>
<p>The solace of his soul?</p>
<p>I feel my spirit sinking!</p>
<p>The son is no stronger than the father,</p>
<p>Am I to still hold out the pleading light,</p>
<p>Like Father,</p>
<p>Head bowed,</p>
<p>He writes, writes, writes…</p>
<p>Barely supporting his strength;</p>
<p>Through the silence of the deep night,</p>
<p>I often hear his bitter cough</p>
<p>And heavy sigh,</p>
<p>I understand this cough, this sigh</p>
<p>How intimate it is!</p>
<p>Father caresses his son, long ill in bed,</p>
<p>In the deep night of that Little West Lake;</p>
<p>I still remember:</p>
<p>His mourning voice:</p>
<p>'Father's life is over,</p>
<p>All buried in the muddy river of life!</p>
<p>My hope</p>
<p>Is all entrusted to you!'</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<p>Cast towards the next generation?!</p>
<h3>In the Back Alley</h3>
<p>— Zhé Yōng</p>
<p>Sunlight never descends on this corner,</p>
<p>Mottled plaster walls display ancient scars,</p>
<p>Morning, evening, foul water and filth,</p>
<p>This abandoned group,</p>
<p>Another corner beyond the foreign concession.</p>
<p>The candy seller once extended sympathy—</p>
<p>To past vicissitudes;</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen disdain to glance,</p>
<p>The city noises outside have long drowned out the alley's groans,</p>
<p>The gears of the era rhythm out a double symphony—elimination, rebirth.</p>
<p>Lingering smoke fills the corner—fleeting, like life,</p>
<p>Past, present, future.</p>
<p>Intermittent memories only increase the sorrow,</p>
<p>This meteoric life, south, east, west, north,</p>
<p>Gray, dim emotions contrast with this gray, dim appearance.</p>
