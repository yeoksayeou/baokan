<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">刻不容緩的華北賬災 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>華北各省久旱成災，災區廣大，災民衆多，慘况空前，我們曾兩度呼籲。請求政府領導主持；慈善團體共同協力。各界人士踴躍輸將。以合羣力量，辦理急賑事宜。尤其緊要的。「救災如救火」，出之敏捷，迅赴事功，俾災區同胞，得以早解倒懸之苦。</p>
<p>我們發出呼籲，雖僅短短三天，而所得的響應，頗足使我們萬分感動而益自奮勵。三　間，迭承讀者紛紛捐款，爲數已逾五萬元。深爲感謝。同時。更蒙各界列舉關於賬災的寳貴音見，這是各界人士發揮同情心，踴躍輸將的表示。</p>
<p>昨天下午，上海特別市政府陳市長，社會福利部丁部長，聯名召集本市各界領袖，爲救災問題，徵詢意見，並討論進行辦法。這是政府主管機關領導主持的表示。</p>
<p>上海各慈善團體，市民福利團體，以及華北同鄉團體，均有代表出席陳丁兩長官的集會，報告災况，發表意見，這是各有關團體共同協力的表示。</p>
<p>我們吏就昨天的集會中，各界領袖的獻議，加以申說如决：</p>
<p>林康侯先生建議：「爲迅赴事機，從速放賑起見，政府主管機關，應向中央儲備銀行先行墊借數千萬元，以之辦理急賑，將來以各界慕集之款歸還。如果等待各界募集捐款以後辦理，則時間上必不能如預期之迅速，而趕不上一急」賑的需要」。我們十分同意於林先生適合時官的建議。爲了應「急」，就不得不有權宜的措置。盼望有關當局採納商酌，使急賑工作，早日實現。</p>
<p>張一鵬先生建議兩點：「（一）發行『賑災公債』，以三分之二由華中華南各界認購，三分之一由華北金融界認購。（二）以華北有餘的物資如煤斤，與華中雜糧交換」。我們對於張先生的建議，在原則上同意。第一點賑災公債，由政府發行，議條例，印債票，經過相當時間，爲充實賑款基礎，由政府負擔，自是合理，不過妥應目前的「急，還是由中央儲備銀行墊借款項爲先，以發行公債爲後，或將來以公債所得歸還借款之不足。第二點物資交換，應列爲賑務中重要之一事，籌議具體　法，從速實施。</p>
<p>袁履登先生願將平時友人贈送之上等雪茄五十箱，不欲一人吸用，而變賣之作爲救災捐款，這站在捐款人的立塲，表示了「變物救災」的同情心。我們把這五十箱雪茄，看作袁先生的私有物，以之變賣助賑，與變賣其他私有物同等意義。如果每個同胞，能有錢出錢，有物出物，那末，華北災情雖重，也必可圓滿救濟，被災同胞生命無虞了。</p>
<p>此外，丁部長更提倡「節的救濟」。袁先生可說是第一個響應。節的的範圍頗廣，我們更盼望所有出入於上海貴族式的菜館，旅館，娛樂塲中的一紳士」階級，於飽餐倦遊之餘，稍一瞑念華北災區的一幅流亡圖，不說同情，就說施捨，撥出飽餐倦遊所用的剩餘部分，以作救災捐款，那末，這個數目，一定比較勞苦階層節汗血之資奔相捐助者爲多。所以，「節的救災一的重心，在實際上還要盼望有錢階級的大發慈悲。</p>
<p>以上所說的，偏於目前我們發動賑災，應做的，緊急的，以至於期望的入手工作。此外，緊　着的問題正多，而最要者就是盼望友邦日本當局，同情我們華北同胞的災情慘重，而給予充分便利實施賑災工作。第一，凡是屬於賑災糧物，一律視作統制物資之例外，而絕對予以輸運上之便利。又如滿洲國過剩的大豆，華中一帶的雜糧，准許自由購買或交換，運往災區發放，這是賑災工作最根本的一點。不然，任何賑款得不到賑物；任何賑物，到不得實地發放，結果還是畫餅充饑。我們深信友邦當局一定樂於協助的，不勝爲華北災民馨香禱之。</p>
<p>最後，我們必須鄭重指出的，這次救濟華北災民成效如何，實含有重大的政治意義。重慶政權與敵人英美方面，已在二個月以前，對豫省旱災竭力宣傳種種急賑辦法，而華北災區，包括河北，河南，山東，山西四省之一部分，以全面積計算，四省人口的一萬萬之中。災民至少佔三分之一，這一區的災民的向心，就在誰能拯救之於飢餓之中，誰就是他們所感戴的救星。所以，國民政府在友邦協力强化政治地位的今天，就必須嚴密注視這廣大災民向心的重要，而竭力爭取之。爭取必勝之道，就在賑災事宜辦到「急」，「切」，「實」三點，敬以貢諸當局，願亟圖之。</p>

<h3 id="c2">英誃員斯特拉波基稱　日軍已叩印度之門　艾納米論阿拉坎英軍戰敗　反攻緬甸企圖已完全粉碎 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　今日接墨爾缽來訊，麥克沃塞將軍總部發表公報云：日空軍頃又轟炸新幾內亞懷埃地方之反軸心軍重要根據地，損害程度未詳。</p>
<p>日內瓦十五日中央社電　倫敦息，英議員斯特拉波基勳爵頃宣稱：英軍反攻愛克耶浦已失敗，復使日軍能叩印度之門，繼謂重慶之地位十分危險，蔣介石並無充足之軍械及軍糧，以阻日　軍之前進。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據倫敦來電稱：紀事報從軍記者艾納米，於十七日在該報發表一文，題爲「阿拉坎英軍作戰失敗之原因」，大意謂，英軍在阿枕坎作戰失敗之原因，大致有五：（一）日軍前在馬來及緬甸之役，對密林作戰獲得寳貴之經騐，此次充分應用此種經騐，使英軍無法應付。（二）英軍及印軍將士不諳密林戰術。（三）英軍野戰司令仍採取前在印度西北邊境地帶所用之一貫戰術或沙漠戰術，而未採取密林作戰戰術。（四）英軍因密林關係，　方之接濟至爲　難，故未能由側面包抄日軍。（五）接濟運輸未利用內河等。總之，阿拉坎作戰之失敗，由於不健全之戰略及戰術所致，英軍在數量上及攻擊力上均遠不及日軍。查作戰當初，英軍之目的在奪回日溪，由阿拉坎海岸擊退日軍，俾將來陸海空三軍能反攻緬甸，並圖竭盡所能，由印度邊境地帶驅出日軍，力阻日軍之攻擊加爾各答軍需工業地帶等，結果因船舶及登陸用船艇未曾開到，致未能攻擊日溪，目不奪取馬酉河之河口，而先攻入頓貝庫拉台登地區，遂鑄成大錯，迨日軍截斷孟多拉其頓兩地間之退路後，英軍遂被迫向後撤退矣。</p>
<p>德人讚揚日軍奮勇</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　自日大本營報道部長谷款少將於十七日說明阿茲島之戰事後，德國國民已明瞭該方面之戰局詳情，莫不讚揚日軍奮勇防禦之精神。國社黨機關報「人民觀察報」十八日以新幾內亞方面戰鬥爲例，就阿圖島戰况之推移表明見解謂，最近美國各報紛紛登載從軍記者所寫關於新幾內亞方面日，美兩軍戰鬥狀况之報吿，記述此項報吿對阿圖島之戰鬥，亦足予以極有興味之表示，現美軍計劃自新幾內亞島將日軍完全驅逐，然日軍戰力强大，美　終無隙可乘，此數月來陸上戰鬥已陷於停頓狀態。據泰晤士週刋消息，反軸心軍爲獲得新幾內亞島上之一叢林，會展開攻勢，結果澳兵戰死六千二百十二人，美兵戰死四千一百十八人，仍未達到目的，此等犧牲者，較西南太平洋反軸心軍地上部隊司令白萊米發表之數字尙多五成，實不可解。由此等事實而解阿圖島之戰局，無論演變至何等程度，確信日軍展開勇敢之死守作戰，美軍之企圖必遭粉碎。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日大本營正式公布　美攻擊日醫院船　前後達九次之多 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日十一時發表，帝國陸軍醫院船自本年初起至四月止，遭美機及潛艇攻擊者，計有七艘，共達九次之多，其中「阿拉伯」丸「烏拉爾」丸及「布宜諾斯艾利斯」丸三艘，被炸負傷，略有傷亡，註：上開各船之船名，船型，，噸數，裝法等要目，均巳由代管日本權利國通知敵方。</p>
<h3 id="c4">堀部長發表談話 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日情報局第三部畏堀公一，十九日就英，美非法攻擊日醫院船事發表談話，大意謂：溯自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，英美當局及其軍隊即屢决對我方軍民採取卑鄙無恥之非人道行爲，我方每决均曾予以指摘，並曾對之提出抗議，但因戰局之發展對於英，美愈形不利，而英，美對我方非軍事設施作非法攻擊之非法行爲，益　猛烈，殆不知其何所底止，尤以自入本年以來，敵機及潛艇攻擊我國醫院船事件已達數决之多，敵方對此明知故犯之野蠻行動，實不能辭咎。就下列事實視之，當可明瞭此等醫院船之船名，均於就航之前以充分餘裕之時日，並經過正當之國　手續通知敵方，目依國際公的規定，各船均髹有極明顯之標識，故一望可知爲負有人道使命之船舶，然敵方明知此爲醫院船，竟故意加以攻擊，事後並狡稱因未認淸其爲醫院船，或稱已訓令所部不得攻擊醫院船之片面遁詞，企圖卸其責任。英，美此種行爲，不僅違反日內瓦海戰條約，且蹂躪人道主義，實爲人神所不許之惡行，固無容贅言。抑且英美動輒高呼維護人道，主張尊重國際義務，一似彼等絕不爲任何非法行爲者，但彼等之言論虛僞，行爲無恥，均已由事實證明，其言行之矛盾，已完全暴露，我國政府對於敵方之暴舉，已挽利益代表國一再向英美兩國政府嚴重抗議矣。茲誌我國遭受攻擊之醫院船船名，當時情况及被害情形如决：（一）阿拉伯丸於本年一月四日爲駛入仰光乃在港內以低速航行，忽遭敵統一型機三架之轟炸，敵機數度於低空反覆轟炸，投炸彈十餘枚，但均落於距船舶十餘米左右之處，略有損害，當時天氣晴朗，雲高在五千米以上，視界極良好。（二）亞阿美利丸於本年一月三十日上午四時二十分在拉巴爾港外（南緯四度十二分三十八秒，東經一百五十二度十七分四十五秒）航行時，有敵機一架來襲，先投下炸彈四枚，均落於該船後方，繼以機槍掃射，我方毫無損害，當時該船之夜間標識完全附以隥光，極爲明顯。（三）馬尼刺丸於本年三月四日上午十一時廿分在東經一百卅六度十七分，北緯五度卅六分之處，遭受魚雷攻擊（二發），當即轉舵，故未受損害。（四）烏拉爾丸於本年四月三日開往拉巴爾，於是日下午二時五十九分在南緯二度四十七分，東經一百五十度七分之處遭受敵機俯衝轟炸，直接中一彈，並有數彈在附近爆炸，致受相當損害，炸死衛生班員六人，船員一人，炸傷衛生班員六人，船員四人，當時空中略有薄雲。（五）扶桑丸於本年四月十五日開往聖特蘭島途中，於東經一百五十二度二十分，南緯三度三十三分之處，會三度遭敵機轟炸，但無損害，其情形如决：（甲）敵機由船首前方的二千五百米之高空投下照明彈一枚及炸彈二枚，炸彈落於距船苜的五百米之處。（乙）敵機復由右舷船首前方的一千五百米之高空投照明彈一枚及炸彈一枚，炸彈落於距左舷（角度的三十五度）四百米之海中。（丙）敵機最後由左舷正中的二千米之高空投下照明彈一枚及炸彈一枚，炸彈落於距左舷正中的二百米之海中。又十六日烏拉爾丸在該島收容患者後，於歸航途中，自下午六時十三分起至八時二十二分止又遭敵機轟炸四次，以機槍掃　二次，人員雖無傷亡，但船體略受損傷。查該兩日敵機轟炸時，月光皎潔，且該船夜間標識完全附有燈光。（六）布宜諾斯艾利斯丸於本年四月十五日在香港海面航行時，於是日下午三時四十五分突遭敵潛艇之魚雷攻擊，船體微傷，負傷七人。（七）此外尙有醫院船瑞德丸，業於去年十月二十八日通知敵方爲醫院船，亦會於本年四月二十七日下午十時三十分在哥戈波海面遭受敵機轟炸，中機關槍彈二十發。又於此有附帶加以說明者，即最近德國批評家曾指出，北非前綫美軍毫無紀律，美國有識之士，對美軍之無紀律亦深表不滿，如紐約泰晤士報軍事評論家鮑爾溫最近視察北非前綫歸來，曾謂：「美國人不論爲國民或將來爲軍人，均必須嚴守紀律」。渠又太息曰：「美軍迄今尙缺乏指揮者之技術云」又敵方暴行實不勝枚舉，猶憶去年四月十八日美機空襲東京之際，竟以機槍掃射無辜之學童，並盲炸民房，其野蠻無恥之行爲，唯英美軍能出之耳，敵軍旣無紀律復缺乏道德心，故採取此種非法行爲，若容許彼等存在，則世界上永無和平正義人道矣。</p>

<p>廣州十九日中央社電　據某地戰綫日軍某基地電訊，日軍航空部隊於本日空襲駐渝美空軍最前綫基地建甌飛機塲，日森炸機隊於某時自基地出發，向建甌機塲上空進擊，冒渝軍熾烈之防空砲火，猛炸該機塲，塲中正在修理中之滑走路，又再中炸彈，全部粉碎，日機更轟炸市外渝軍軍事設施，各處均中彈起火，日機全部安返防地。按建甌渝機塲，爲駐渝美空軍企圖空襲日本之最前綫基地，前會積極整備擴充，本月四日八日曾遭日機兩度猛炸，軍事設施及滑走路等，全部被毀，其後渝軍曾積極趕修，此次再遭轟炸，終至完全被毀，不能復用。</p>

<p>南京十九日中央社電　自龐炳勳將軍參加和平陣營後，渝方內部即頓呈動搖，尤其前由馮玉祥統率之舊西北軍與現正徬徨於偏僻各地之舊東北軍動搖最甚。據悉于學忠·湯恩伯·馮治安·馬占山等，今頗後悔過去之行爲·又傳馬占山以萬餘雜軍駐於酷寒惡熱之鄂爾多斯，僅在傅作義軍之監視下，保其餘喘，而馬之肺病今亦漸形沉重，故似已極感苦痛。</p>
<p>廣州十九日中央社電　據渝息，渝「軍事委員會」發言人關於龐炳勳將軍之參加和運，遲至十八日始承認其事。並對龐將軍毅然參加和運之明哲措置，故意歪曲事實，又將七萬餘將士參加和運之事實與以乖謬之解說。窺其用意，顯在企圖抑制渝軍及一般民衆之活動心理，由此可說明渝方對此狼狽情形一斑。</p>
<p>漢口十九日中央社電　湖南前綫電，此次日軍展開之夏季進攻作戰，已使渝方軍事經濟政治等各方面均蒙致命打擊。現渝方又恐懼於日軍之繼續向其內地進攻，在此次之日軍新作戰中，渝方缺乏抗戰武力之最大弱點，已完全暴露。如日軍在洞庭湖畔殲減戰中，渝第六戰區代理司令長官孫速仲，爲挽回翻勢，乃積極宣傳，以全兵力實行反攻，且似有相當自信，然自此次作戰開始後，因日軍之掌握主動地位，故渝軍對作戰之判斷，完全錯誤，蓋渝軍果欲阻止日軍進攻，至少亦須若干師之兵力，然渝軍竟僅以某師之兵力從事作戰，此種作戰指導，無異自殺行爲，故孫連仲部下第七十三軍軍長彭位仁以决各軍長師長等首腦部，對所部部隊發出抗戰命令後，即先行逃逸，其不負責任及對抗戰喪失自信之醜態，實已暴露無遺。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　海通社特派員林特曼本日稱：華盛頓會議現時之中斷，乃因羅斯福總統會邀請斯達林舉行英·美·蘇三國領袖會議，現正等候斯達林之答覆，不僅華盛頓之政界方面作如是之論斷，即中立國之觀察家亦抱如是見解，而羅斯福總統亦云，反軸心會議之中斷，並非因渠與渠之赴印專使費里沛斯之討論。同時羅斯福總統專使戴維思之抵達庫壁希夫，巳使美京之國會方面及倫敦各流亡政府之辦事處大起騷動，據中立國記者稱：斯達林是否接受邀請與羅斯福及邱吉爾會議，對於歐洲政策爲有拘束性之諾言一問題，不僅使政治性之會議停頓，且在斯達林答覆未分曉之前，軍事性之會議亦爲之中止。羅斯福總統之關切斯達林之答覆，蓋有兩項原因，基於國內政治之原因，羅斯福總統必須嚴守其自己民族自決權利之政策，此政策乃羅斯福總統最近所屢决提及者，關於此點，倫敦泰晤士報昨日載稱；美國之公衆輿論已逐漸贊成有一種國際協定，並期望對於土地及國界之規定確立原則，但羅斯福及國會方面在未得莫斯科之答覆前，實不敢着手於該問題，在另一方面，流亡政府則要求闡明如反軸心國獲勝之後，彼等所代表之國家命運將如何，彼等力稱：如彼等不能獲得保証，不致爲蘇聯野心之犧牲者，則彼等不能使民衆相信有以反軸心武裝干預及從事陰謀破壞之必要。華盛頓會議自開始以來，即遭此問題之阻礙，而現時在期待莫斯科答覆之前夕，該問題更形重大，美國領袖似欲將反軸心在歐洲之政事及軍事計劃之陷於停頓歸咎於蘇聯，反軸心方面之見解以爲喀坦森林事件，使小國覺悟蘇聯所留與彼等之命運，實爲困難理由之一，另一理由則爲斯達林之强頑態度及其不參加加薩勃朗加會議及華盛頓會議。反軸心方面稱：此種事實已使小國之主動陷於停頓，然無小國之積極合作，則反軸心進攻歐洲之成功殊堪疑問。</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（七）君主制在英國</p>
<p>凡是英國人，沒有一個不是祗顧自己便宜。在任何情境，首先爲自己打算，而仟意處理。就是國王假使有所不滿意，也任意逐出國外，如其遇到大英帝國的屬領要想分離獨立，立即利用對國王的忠義心，來收拾其崩潰的趨向。</p>
<p>如其帝冠是那樣的重要，爲何他們沒有建立起對帝冠的根本道理呢？俗語云：「看見了賊綯出繩來」，英國人在此地所用的繩，差不多已經是腐朽的繩了。這責任不在英國的王室而在於英國的憲法，阿那托爾·法朗士（Anatoly　France）曾說：</p>
<p>「凡是英國人沒有像表面的理想那樣淺薄惡俗的人。在其潛意識中，實在極爲精微而深邃，不容易揣測。」</p>
<p>像這樣的英人無論如何無理，不講理，如有必要，有不顧一切而進行鐵石心腸。</p>
<p>英國的憲法，把國王比作有限責任會社的會長，社長，對國王的忠誠，就是維繫澳洲，加拿大，南菲，甚至於印度的繩索。</p>
<p>英國的君主制，在維多利亞女王的中期以後，頗爲奇異。維多利亞女皇爲皇婿亞爾倍之喪而着喪服，不出入於公共塲所，幽居過寡婦生活，可是在英人中，尙且有人不平，因而共和論一時也成爲實際問題而提出於議會。張伯倫，台爾格，夫克勞等，就是堅決主張共和論者。</p>
<p>這時候，皇太子愛德華，出現於社交塲，而爲人讚頌，情勢就多少緩和起來。但女皇在晚年頗收拾些人心。女皇的美德可得而言者，她是一個克己的人。女皇的政治文書，極爲浩瀚，女皇如何與當局的政治家相交涉，由此可見。</p>
<p>例如對拉特斯頓那樣將近八十歲的老大政治家，以其演說過激，而直言指叱。在閣僚的選擇上，總理大臣所提出的名單，不加更動的全部通過，頗爲困難。又如首相的選擇，因爲政黨的首領很多，故沒有爽爽快快比命令某人組閣，往往經過很多的曲折。女皇怎樣運用其政權呢？克蘭格，哈台在一九三五年從牛津大學出版部中刊行了一本以「維多利亞女皇之政治的勢力」爲題的書，說得很明白：</p>
<p>「爲人頗强於愛憎，尤以在其中期，曾玩弄猶太人宰相奇斯雷車於股掌，她又是堅實的，剛情的，在英國宮庭中，是最淸潔的。世間也有人說她把蘇格蘭人的翰，普拉翁那樣的强漢當作從者，過於寵用，但這不過是笑柄，不能成爲惡評的原因。」</p>
<p>總之，女皇的在世六十餘年間，在英國是君主政治的全盛時期，英國的王位，在這裏也愈加確實鞏固了。</p>
<p>繼女皇之後的是愛德華七世，愛德華七世在六十歲前，尙爲皇太子，然而在這許多歲月中，曾代表皇室在社交方面有相當的活動，在政治方面，則不令參與。格拉斯頓曾向女皇進言：</p>
<p>「現在把稍爲重要的政治文書，給他看看，怎樣？」</p>
<p>女皇加以拒絕：</p>
<p>「國家的機密，當作　意兒，那還了得。」</p>
<p>原來愛德華七世在女皇夫婦的嚴厲監督並規定下，施以極嚴肅的敎育。皇太子在學生時代，甚至於其襟飾的配色，花紋，也要由女皇選定。然而那嚴格的敎育產生了相反的效果，造成了這樣一個完全不良的少年。</p>
<p>世上的豪飮，打架，揮霍三套把戲，皇太千都齊備！，及其長而爲皇太子，他不說英國，而說歐洲大陸。皇太子所做的工作，有時爲詐欺賭博事件的裁判，有時爲離婚的裁判事件上的證人或參考人。「泰晤士」報曾就皇太子的行動出以警吿的文字，女皇特意向主筆台倫表示感謝之意。而皇太子亦向廉德倍利大主敎具結，關於賭博事件，不管以前如何，以後決不再引起問題。</p>
<p>但是愛德華決不是一個祗知放蕩遊樂的人，他一面固然耽溺賽馬賭博，投機及其他不良方面的嗜好，而在他面對世界外交的動向也很注意，並對民衆之所好者亦極關注，在任何塲台，不忘爲國盡瘁。</p>
<p>有人說，英國皇太子，從法國寶淫婦的口中，探知政界的機密，改變與法國反目的關係，英法成爲協商，不久甚至於連俄國也加入他們的集團，這未必不是他的力量，然而倍爾福等對他的努力還嫌不够，還奢望更大的效果。</p>
<p>日英同盟亦然。伊藤公在俄國與維脫商議日協商未成，回國途中所說要經過倫敦，那時節愉快近耶穌聖誕節的，照習慣是是不適於接待外容的，但他不管，他對當時的首相薩立斯倍利說：「在首相官邸招待，如何？」並且自己允與以正式的謁見。可見其注意的無微不至。</p>
<p>又如日俄戰爭時，日本在紐約及倫敦募集資金，允日本欠若干息金，今日雖已成敵國，我們對此亦深誌不忘。又明治四十年伏見宮貞愛親王往山本，西兩相英國時，愛德華七世在親王的滯留期中，特地命令把正在上演中的「密加特」一劇中止。那自然是爲了對日本皇室，對日本親王，表示敬意的緣故。</p>
<p>他逾六十歲而即帝位，在位十年逝世，英國的社會，至愛德華朝，而頽廢的氣氛愈著。然而在政治方面，決不能說是到了無謀無策的窮運。</p>
<p>愛德華七世即使有過失，甚至於罪惡，但以一國元首地位，在指導國政的方針上，則是堅決確固的。經綸國家的大策，縱不能說毫無遺憾，但也可以說一聲差强人意了。</p>
<p>喬治五世旣沒有像他父親那樣的惡評，也沒有像他父親那樣的得人心。他是一個無功無過的君主。現在我們要說到愛德華八世了，（翔：譯自五月五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>茶會情形</p>
<p>四時正，來賓紛紛　齊，首由丁部長致詞，繼由陳市長代表趙秘書長致詞，旋由華北旅京同鄕會代表張英華郭　如李子峯等報告華北各省被災情形，末由袁履登林康侯張一鵬三氏致詞，至五時許始散，席間袁履登氏鑒於華北災情嚴重，頗表同情，將所存置之舶來品最名貴之雪茄烟五十箱，今市上現已無貨，每箱値價至一千元以上，故五十箱共五萬元，願慨捐義賣，以賑濟華北災荒。</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>「今天本人會同陳市長，爲籌賑華北的災荒，略具茶點，在此　待本市各界領袖，蒙諸位先生在百忙中光臨，深爲感謝，陳市長因病不克親自參加，特由趙秘書長代表招待，關於華北災荒，本人以主管部的立塲，有幾點意見，想提出貢獻於上海各界領袖的：</p>
<p>重視滬市協力</p>
<p>此次華北災荒災情異常嚴重，災區之廣災民之多實爲罕見，汪主席極爲關垂，除已令飭撥一部份賑款外，並令飭社會福利部及糧食部等分別辦理賑濟，惟災區廣大，僅靠政府的力量是不够的，必須民間有力方面其同籌劃，始有宏效，上海爲全國經濟中心，人力物力，都較內地集中，如上海方面的民衆能全力協助，其收效更易，故此次籌賑，我們上海方面，特別重視，期望亦特別股切。</p>
<p>提倡節約救災</p>
<p>不過近幾年來，因物價高漲，上海市民的生活亦頗艱困，大有自顧不暇，心餘力絀之苦，故從井救人，我們並不希望，但上海有力的人，還是不少，聲色犬馬酒綠燈紅的消費亦是很大，因此，我們固不要求從井救人，但節約救災則亟需提倡，每一個人能在非必需的消費中節省一分錢，捐輸一分錢，集大多數人的力量，就可得很大的數目，可以救很多的災民，此種節的救濟災民的辦法，在捐輸者本人僅僅减少一點不必要的享受，並不感到痛苦，但以此給予被災的難民，則是受惠無窮，感激不盡，故希望上海的市民，尤其民間有力的人士，能提倡節的救災的運動，來對華北的災民伸出同情之手。</p>
<p>三項籌賬辦法</p>
<p>其次，此次在上海籌賑的辦法，我們預定的有京戲大會串足球義賽跑馬義賽等等，剛纔要求大家的是節的消費，請大家從節的消費中省下錢來，賑濟災民，現在要求大家的是對於這爲籌賑而舉辦的娛樂節目如京戲足球跑馬等，要努力提倡，把本來預備在別的地方要消費的錢，留些來消費在這三方面，旣可娛樂，又可救濟災民，可說是一舉兩得。</p>
<p>籌組捐募機構</p>
<p>最後，我們不要因爲災民之多，災區之廣，而感灰心，我們有一分力量盡一分力量，至於辦理賑災的組織，除已由華北同鄕組織的華北急賑會之外，有幾位先生會建議由各界人士自動組織一機構，這意思很好，詳細的辦法待硏究後則可公怖，總之，政府方面是站在領導監督的地位，實際工作希望各界人士去負責，務使涓滴歸公，不生流弊。</p>
<p>今天參加的諸位，都是上海各界的領袖，都是社會上有力的份子，希望諸位多多提倡，多多協助，來爲華北的災民籌慕賑款，我相信以上海一地，一定能在最短期間，可以集成鉅款，來賑濟華北的災民。</p>
<p>趙秘長詞</p>
<p>陳市長代表趙秘書長致詡，略　：「華北此次在國家多難之秋，慘遭嚴重災荒，吾人應格外有所感觸，予以同情，尤其在此環境中，上海民衆，更應予以莫大援助，方才丁部長致詞中，所示要點，（一）以政府力量出而救濟，（二）社會民衆自動發起　　，（三）　　　　　　　　納捐款，尤以賑濟飢寒難胞，刻不容緩，否則數千萬人，難以獲教，本市爲全國經濟中心點，急公好義之熱心人士，當不爲少，以往上海對賬災捐款，踴躍輸將，在勸募力量上，有良好之表現，是以此項勸募，鑒於華北難胞哀鴻遍野，慘不忍覩，決能毅然廣爲勸募，且目今中樞當局對滬市方面勸募，已有具體計劃，本市民衆爲副中央之期望，全市各界應打成一片，以獲致圓滿成功，尤其在此時代中，對此更特別重視，特別予以努力，滬市府當秉承中央意旨，短期內努力促成。</p>
<p>各界致詞</p>
<p>（一）袁嚴登氏，除對華北災荒表示極大同情外，普天期望　本市各界盡各人能力援助，同時對此項廣大勸募，希望分工合作，俾克奏宏効，早日完成。（二）林康侯氏云：救災如救火，華北災荒慘重，本市當全力動員救濟，現政府旣領導於先，救災應速救活，籲請中央先墊款賑濟，再由人民相繼捐輸，是乃急救之至要方式。（三）張一鵬氏演詞大意謂：華北災况嚴重，人民政府熱誠賑救難胞，更應協力相助，除祈求政府先行墊款外，並希發行賑災公債，此外，華中方面應予以籌糧輸送，而更望華北方面亦將華中華南所匱乏之物資互換，則今後南北物資，不但相互交流，且可大量暢通。</p>

<h3 id="c43">「經濟警察」 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>日昨報載中央警官學校經濟警察，行將訓練期滿，分發服務。以一般警政而論，我國辦理雖已有年，祇以過往之未能積極改善，以致在民衆一般心理上，尙乏良好印象，經濟警察，事屬初辦，允切盼其能振作精神，一新視聽。</p>
<p>關於改善警政，本報曾迭有論述。經濟警察，爲警政重要之一環，尤爲推行戰時經濟政策重要工具之一。其一般所應注意事項，固與普通警察，初無二致，但就經濟立塲而言，則有下列三點，宜加注意：</p>
<p>（一）經濟的常識：經濟警察，顧名思義，其工作自當特別注重於經濟。警員木身，對於普通經濟常識，應力求豐富，如檢査物資，調査物價，應有明確之判斷，敏捷之處置，倘竟因循躭誤，游移不決，則公私兩方，都蒙損失。</p>
<p>（二）服務的精神：經濟警察，對於一般民衆，應力避消極的挑剔處罰，多作積極的指示勸導；蓋有若干民衆，往往非敢故意犯法，祇因不知禁例，或不明手續：若在此種塲合之下，即當出以熱誠指導態度，在法定範圍內，盡量予以勸吿，予以糾正，以减民衆摸索之苦。</p>
<p>（三）廉潔的操守：警員操守，最爲重要，經濟警察之操守，尤爲重要，否則遇事挑剔，遇事留難，甚且「欲加之罪」，以遂具無端勒索之目的，則其結果，徒以擾民。此爲經濟警察所最須避免之惡習，尤爲警政當局所最須提防之一點。</p>
<p>在此初辦經濟警察之時，深望身爲經濟警察者，人人能發揮其豐富的智識，美善的精神，高尙的品格，以作改進一般警務之倡導，樹立一般警察之楷模。</p>

<p>據中央社記者訪問財政當局所知，中儲券與聯銀券之比値，絕無變更意向，其申匯亦維持現在狀態，在於上月開始限制由南京至徐州間往返携款之新標準額，乃因鑒於當時投機者多利用小量物資，往往携運投機取利，其措置乃在取締投機爲目的。</p>

<p>晨開各股正式行市，均在疲落中，迄少興奮氣象，成交不旺。新藥業之中法藥房正午時已退入關內，惟新亞藥廠成交尙屬不寂。百貨業國貨公司平穩，永安公司見小有買戶，新新公司新股做開淸稀，中國內衣站定。紡織業永安紗廠美亞綢廠均堅定，價略昇。小票面中美綸毛織獨見昂昇，餘平。文化業世界書局搜求者衆，商務中華則均係賣出價而罕有受戶。公用業頗不乏問津者，閘北水電與華商　氣價均略堅。大中華火柴新股成交不稀，南洋烟草較上日無軒輊。又據聞外股中之中紡及信和二紗廠，實係華商所創設，故有將在華股市塲開做之消息。</p>

<p>化學工業社又將派貨日用品肥皂在本年春間，受囤戶作崇，價格狂漲，達於頂點，但究無巨大實銷，故不久即吿回跌，迄於目前市勢呈一蹶不振之象，上月間正當皂價下跌之際，中國化學工業社以節刀三千箱實行平賣，於是傾跌正烈之黑市，竟就此站穩，最近數日肥皂之黑市，售價已低於公開售價，而中國化學工業社之第二期派貨數量，亦經全國商業統制總會核准，爲二千五百箱，並爲便利市民購買，規定每家大同行四箱，小同行二箱，以資普遍。至其出售價仍與上次同，待一切手續辦妥，即可開始派貨。</p>

<p>物資調查委員會，自經最高國防會議通過成立後，日內即將召開首决委員會，事前先由各關係機關，分別澈査銀錢業，保險菜，倉庫業等之囤積，並進行防止囤積工作，一俟首决委員會舉行，各該工作，可望作比較有計劃，有力量，之推動。現在之澈査防止囤積工作，大體如决：</p>
<p>銀錢業：上海特別市經濟局，已擬定「銀錢業商品担保貸款調査表」，分令銀行公會，錢業公會各會員塡報，並規定押款之期間不得超過三個月。又未登記商品，行號及非同業公會會員，不得作押款，其調查表格內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）公司登記號碼，年月日。（二）借款者，個人姓名職業，公司名稱，代表者名。（三）住所，（四）貸額金額。（五）期限。（六）擔保商品名。（七）單位數量。（八）保存塲所。（妨）備考。</p>
<p>保險業：保險監理局已飭令各保險公司，自四月一日起，凡保險額在五十萬元以上者，須將保戶之姓名，住址，及貨物保存地點等詳細填報，但囤戶奸滑，爲避免發覺而分別保險，例如五十萬元者，分向五家保險，則每家已祇十萬元，故保險監理局方面尙在準備更澈底之澈査辦法。</p>
<p>倉庫業：工部局對於轄境內之一百七十五家營業倉庫，已實行物資調査，並準備調查個人所有之非營業倉庫，小型堆棧等，如上項調査工作竣事，則此舉對於防止囤積必多功用，歸納以上動態而言，則物資調查委員會將其調查基礎，關於市政府經濟局，警察局，工部局物資統制局，警署等機關，希望各該機關，必須澈底澈查。（雲鵬：譯自五月十九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c54">一個靑年的哀訴 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 繼昌</p>
<p>傑：</p>
<p>當你接到我道一封信的時候，一定先是感到驚奇，然後在腦海裏隱隱的的的搜索出我的影子來吧　的確，我們離開得太久了。</p>
<p>你總還記得當畢業典禮完畢的時候，有些—人是高聲談論着升學的問題：『燕京太貴族化啦！』『之江又是怎樣怎樣啦！」有的是得意忘形，高聲唱着歌曲：一面還拿着牙刷柄拚命的敲着而盆來打拍子。有的是悶聲不饗地忙着搽司丹康，擦皮鞋，整理漂亮的西裝，預備去會見他的愛人。有的呢？已在收拾行李，準備返歸甜蜜的家鄉，去安慰他倚門的老母了。寬大的宿舍裏鬧得一團糟，眞是要天翻地覆了。這時我呢？我却早已悄悄地溜出了宿舍，在靜穆的校國裏往來躑躅着，腦海裏是充滿了問號，升學呢？當然很好，吳先生曾經在畢業考試完了的那天晚上讓我到他小小的房間裏，很鄭重的詢問我今後的動向，並且還再三用着莊嚴仁慈的口吻對我說：『你一定要繼續求學啊！你憑着你優越的大資和努力，已經修畢了中學，你應當想到國家社會培植你是多麽艱苦的一件事，假使不再深造是說不過去的啊！』繼續求學，誰不願意，但是…但是，那裏來這麽許多金錢來供給我呢？</p>
<p>終於我是屈服在經濟之下抱着滿腔悲哀，離開了相處數年的學校，用我靑年的熱誠開始進入社會，費了九牛二虎之力，也不知耗了多少光陰，方始由一個遠親介紹到一家洋行裏去當大寫，這期間我就受到了挫折，嘗到了人生的苦杯，而每天到行裏過着刻　的生活，忍受人家的白眼的奚落，又是無法躱避，最後是受到了戰爭的影響，洋行解散，就開始了我流浪的生涯，雖然我是竭力地找尋職業可是在這舉目無親的社會中，不論什麽職業都挨不到我的身上；於是投稿，替人家抄寫…每天坐在窄小黑暗的亭子間裏，地上充滿了骯髒，僅有的小桌上是什麽中西都有，好容易留着一小片乾凈土，我就坐着，用我尙未　失神經的右手在白紙上塡滿黑字，其他一切凡是能够使我活命的工作我也都幹過，可憐一雙開了口的皮鞋還是跟隨着我這不長進的主人，一天得不到工作，就餓上一天，並且出賣勞力的事，又沒法幹，我常常抱着那破碎的文憑，對着那已經發銹的銀盾默默地流淚。</p>
<p>每當有了一點錢的時候，總是喜歡到小酒店裏去大嚼一頓，讓酒精來麻醉我的神經，使我好似離開了這混濁的世界，雖然酒醒了以後發　到我仍是逗留在這人世間總是要悲痛一塲，然而我仍是歡喜喝酒讓它來支配我。由於我的沉鬰和醉後的哭笑無常，同居人都以爲我是一個不可救藥　瘋子，幾决要房東摔我出去，可是　慈祥的房東一個年近五旬的婦人，她明瞭我的身世，同情我，可憐我，有暇時常來安慰我，然而有什麽用呢？我這空虛的小心靈是無論如何塡不滿的了。</p>
<p>我也幾决要想自殺跑到黃浦江邊，對着那滔滔的流水發呆，可是每當千鈞一髮的時候，紗想到畢業時校長先生在臺上大聲疾呼地說：『靑年　出路是要從荊棘裏奮鬥出來的　不要因受到了挫折就灰心…』。我自殺的勇　就消滅（，只得拖着沉重的身子回家去。</p>
<p>這樣過了一年多沒有規則的生活終於在我的痰裏是發現了血絲，晚間的潮熱，咳嗽吿訴我『肺病』這可怕的惡魔是臨到我身上了，我好像已經看見他仲出醜惡的雙手，聽他見發出得意的笑聲。</p>
<p>傑請你來一次吧，看在三年同窗的面上，你總　致拒絕的吧！你以前是對我抱有極大希望的，現在就請你來看看像我這樣的靑年！誠上。</p>
<h3 id="c55">天才是什麼？ <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 張弦</p>
<p>人們成功一件事情，總是　着他　越的天　。</p>
<p>十三四歲的孩子寫得一手好字；數學，理化，倒是一班裏年紀輕的同學成績　，那不是天才嗎？</p>
<p>而且，如果不是天才的分別、怎樣會有些你能做得來的事情，我却做不來呢？</p>
<p>的確，天才是成功的要素。</p>
<p>不過，天才是什麽？</p>
<p>孩子是沒有許多心事的，他會把全部注意力去應儲一件感覺興趣或是受到獎勵的事情；天才，就是這個偉大的注意力。</p>
<p>愛迪生說：一天才的百分之九十九是工作的血汗。」以往的修　程度可以加强決定做的時候會與不會。所以，天才，就是工作。修養的累積。</p>
<p>隨時多見多聞聞，努力學習、臨時鎭靜注意，你　能够應付一切。你將是最大的天才？</p>
<h3 id="c56">吿頹廢者 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 云夫</p>
<p>近來有許多人，大　抱着消極的態度。不但是老年人如此，連靑年人也是如此。尤其是那些剛從學校中出來。靑年，只要我們稍一留心，就隨時可以聽到他們許多悲覜的論調。在路上散步的時候，假使過見了熟人，一開口往往就嘆息起來。他們大都曾經充滿着熱情，去追求過甜密的夢境，但當他們的理想，給　實的黑暗的環境粉碎了以後，就開始消極頽廢起來。他們不顧這態度的是否　當，也忘却了自身責任的重大，和對社會國家的影響，就這樣對一切感不到興趣地絕望了。</p>
<p>頽廢是一切失敗的原因。一個人倘若被環境屈服了以後，就消極下去，那麼他一定沒有成功的一天。也惟有有毅力有勇氣的人，才能不頽廢地戰勝了一切的困難。因爲一件事的成功，決不是偶然的事。是要有毅力的人，不屈不撓地經過長時期的奮鬥，除去了許多困難以後，才能達到目的。試看古今的許多英雄偉人，他們那一個不是從惡劣的環境中，經過了無數决的失敗後，才達到他們的目的。所以　境不過是一種阻力。它只妨礙了我們的前進，而事　的成功與吾，還看我們有沒有頽　。</p>
<p>這幾年來環境的惡劣，是不能否認的。但我們不該頹廢下去，因爲人類的慾望是無窮的，環境因此也決沒有完全合於理想的時候，我們應該充分運用自己的力量，來竭力破壞一切　　我們進前的障物。</p>

<p>— 謙父</p>
<p>勤儉的目的，原是爲着維持生命和發展生命的，若過於勤儉而損傷生命，戕害生命，那便不是勤儉之道，而是貧吝之賊。</p>
<p>只顧自己面面光，不肯說一句正義公道話。這種人，雖可賺小便宜，却不能得大利益；雖不致開罪任何人，但也沒一個眞朋友。</p>
<p>讀書不貴乎死記其詞句，而貴乎能貫通其要義；因爲死記只能得到外表的形式，或作抄襲引用的張本，惟獨能貫通其要義，才能領略其精髓，闡發其眞理。（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c58">我是一個朝奉 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 高俊</p>
<p>我拖，衰弱了　身體，每天總得守候在賬台旁邊，千篇一律地寫些什麽「布對短褂」啊！「「合夾中」啊！「同手表」之類，從早上七時至晚間十一時寫票，札包，　賬，……這樣地過了三年，我又升任爲櫃檯先生了，亦就量上海人所說的「朝奉」先生。</p>
<p>我還記得，在數年前某報的副刋上，曾看見一些關於「朝奉」的文章，活生生地畫出一副朝奉先生的臉譜，在我看起來，固然是同樣地憎恨，但亦有些異樣的感　，我以爲這大部份的原因是社會環境所造成，朝奉不過是老闆發財　工具而已，有許多爲了生活煎迫着他，或是爲了老闆虧待他……於是他們的積怨就只有在顧客身上發洩了。</p>
<p>在一般同行中則學徒，較順利地做起賬房，繼又升爲櫃檯，並不是一件容易的事，算是對本行頗肯苦學的我，欣幸地得到了所謂「朝奉」的頭銜，但仍然是禁在鳥籠式的店裏，擔的「風火」更大了，櫃前價錢還得太低，被主客責駡，他們不當，生意不好，自己進賬亦减少了，而且老闆又要責備，當進來太貴了又得賠錢。</p>
<p>旣然做了這樣一個差事。生活亦就來個轉變，我像報復似的給學徒輩許多事做，吃飯的時候，把空碗向學徒輩手裏一塞，自自然然地盛了第二碗第三碗送過來……。</p>
<p>事變後，鈔票貶　，物價起了　個人大的變動，投機家運用技巧，更刺激着物價向上在跳，這樣，被許多人認爲剝削貧民的我們押業，受到鈔票跌價的打擊的確不小，精明的老闆早就改了行，把職工遺散了，也許有人以爲我們職工可以得到一票遺散　，然而失望得很，老闆定發財了，一個沒有別樣技能的朝奉，分得幾百元，用我們的「存箱」（與　心店的小賬一樣是拆賬式　）的錢，可是打破了飯碗一隻。</p>
<p>我舊的老闆是去年夏季停業的，我第一次感到失業的恐懼。</p>
<p>在這樣的社會裏，是誰都敵不住生活的鞭策的呀！被喚爲「朝奉」的我，除了押當業以外，別的技能是一無所長，處此形形之下，祇等着餓死；就是萬幸找到了別的從業員，拿幾百元的薪水，除了自已的　宿　，多餘的恐怕另用亦不够，家庭的負擔無着落，餓死是誰亦不願意的。於是我還是向熟行裏跑，可是日子過得愈來愈緊張，從大石庫門的店堂轉到單開間的店家去任事，繼而流落到一般所謂「飯店」「茶室一名爲「正當娛樂塲所」的門口，像厠所似的小，外面掛着舊貨商行的押當裏仟事，這時是再加上一個「舊貨鬼」的頭銜了。</p>
<p>由於「正當娛樂塲所」的勃興，迭成了押當業畸形的發展，也正是職工們的黃金時代，但反而釀成一部份職工走向墮落的路去過着荒淫的日子。</p>
<p>舊的老闆賺到了錢，改了行，更　發起財來，現在新興的小老闆資產在增加起來，我嗎？總算「運道」好些，債是沒有的，然而額上的皺紋已增加了許多，朝奉依然是個朝奉，在現社會裏面，過着憂慮的日子！</p>

<p>際此食糧匱乏，粉價昂貴之時，節的消費與增加生產，同等重要，故吾人食用米糧，第一要擇兵營養豐富者，以本市戶口米而言，大部均係糙米，市民爲習慣所趨，每必厭惡，多將糙米碾成白米，　碾　之糟層，祗供飼畜，致大好　他命B，耗於虛無，旣不經濟，允甚可惜。而純凈白米，雖飮食恃，容易下腹，但其營養較糙米爲差。據日本營業學家井上兼雄博士在他所著的「營養的科學」一書中說：「多食肉類的東西，相反的身　會有不健康的情形，容易發生動派硬化症，而目營養的價値也沒有病症，而且營養的價値也沒有比植物性食品多」。是以說明植物性食品價格經濟而營養充分，邇來糧食部以爲値此戰時，萬不宜再事浪費，亟機提倡食用糙米，以謀　的而裕民食也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Urgent North China Disaster Relief <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The provinces of North China have suffered from prolonged drought, resulting in a vast disaster area, a large number of victims, and unprecedented devastation. We have appealed twice, requesting government leadership and coordination, joint efforts from charitable organizations, and enthusiastic contributions from all sectors of society to combine our collective strength to handle urgent disaster relief matters. What is particularly important is to "treat disaster relief as fighting a fire," acting swiftly and promptly to alleviate the suffering of the compatriots in the disaster area as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although only three short days have passed since we issued our appeal, the response we have received is enough to deeply move us and further encourage us. In the meantime, we have received numerous donations from readers, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. We are deeply grateful. At the same time, we have also received valuable opinions from all sectors regarding disaster relief, which demonstrates the compassion and enthusiastic contributions of all sectors.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Shanghai Special Municipal Government Mayor Chen and Minister Ding of the Social Welfare Department jointly convened leaders from all sectors of the city to solicit opinions and discuss implementation methods for disaster relief. This represents the leadership and coordination of the responsible government agencies.</p>
<p>Representatives from Shanghai's charitable organizations, civic welfare organizations, and North China native place associations attended the meeting convened by Mayor Chen and Minister Ding, reporting on the disaster situation and expressing their opinions. This represents the joint cooperation of the relevant organizations.</p>
<p>We would like to elaborate on the suggestions made by leaders from all sectors at yesterday's meeting as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou suggested: "In order to respond quickly to the situation and expedite disaster relief, the responsible government agencies should first borrow tens of millions of yuan from the Central Reserve Bank to handle urgent disaster relief, and then repay it with funds raised from all sectors. If we wait until after all sectors have raised donations before taking action, the timing will inevitably be slower than expected and will not meet the needs of urgent relief." We fully agree with Mr. Lin's timely suggestion. In order to respond to the "urgency," we must take expedient measures. We hope that the relevant authorities will adopt and deliberate on this suggestion so that urgent relief work can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng suggested two points: "(1) Issue 'Disaster Relief Public Bonds,' with two-thirds purchased by all sectors in Central and South China and one-third purchased by the North China financial community. (2) Exchange surplus resources in North China, such as coal, for coarse grains from Central China." We agree with Mr. Zhang's suggestions in principle. For the first point, the government should issue disaster relief public bonds, draft regulations, and print bond certificates. After a reasonable period, to enrich the foundation of disaster relief funds, the government should bear the responsibility, which is reasonable. However, to address the current "urgency," borrowing funds from the Central Reserve Bank should be prioritized, followed by issuing public bonds, or using the proceeds from the public bonds in the future to repay the shortfall of the loan. For the second point, resource exchange should be listed as an important matter in disaster relief efforts, and concrete measures should be planned and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng wishes to donate fifty boxes of high-quality cigars, usually gifted by friends, not for personal consumption, but to be sold as donations for disaster relief. This demonstrates the compassion of "changing goods for disaster relief" from the perspective of a donor. We regard these fifty boxes of cigars as Mr. Yuan's private property, and using them for disaster relief through sale has the same meaning as selling other private property. If every compatriot can contribute money if they have money, and contribute goods if they have goods, then, although the disaster situation in North China is severe, it can certainly be resolved satisfactorily, and the lives of the affected compatriots will be safe.</p>
<p>In addition, Minister Ding also advocated "thrifty relief." Mr. Yuan can be said to be the first to respond. The scope of thrift is quite broad, and we also hope that all "gentlemen" who frequent Shanghai's aristocratic restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, after enjoying their meals and leisure, will take a moment to recall the picture of refugees in the disaster area of North China. Not to mention sympathy, but out of charity, they can allocate the remaining part of their lavish meals and leisure to make donations for disaster relief. Then, this amount will certainly be more than the hard-working class donating their hard-earned money. Therefore, the focus of "thrifty relief" still relies on the rich class to show great compassion in practice.</p>
<p>What has been said above focuses on the preliminary work we should do, urgently do, and hope to do in launching disaster relief. In addition, there are many pressing issues, and the most important one is to hope that our friendly neighbor, the Japanese authorities, will sympathize with the severe disaster situation of our compatriots in North China and provide full convenience for implementing disaster relief work. First, all disaster relief food and supplies should be treated as exceptions to controlled materials and absolutely guaranteed convenience in transportation. Also, surplus soybeans from Manchuria and coarse grains from the Central China region should be allowed to be freely purchased or exchanged and transported to the disaster area for distribution. This is the most fundamental point of disaster relief work. Otherwise, any relief funds will not get relief goods; any relief goods will not be distributed in the field, and the result will still be drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. We firmly believe that the friendly authorities will be happy to assist, and we offer our sincere prayers for the victims of the disaster in North China.</p>
<p>Finally, we must solemnly point out that the effectiveness of this relief effort for the victims of the disaster in North China has significant political implications. The Chongqing regime and the enemy British and American sides have been vigorously publicizing various emergency relief measures for the drought in Henan Province two months ago. In the disaster area of North China, including parts of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, the population is at least one-third of the total population of 100 million in the four provinces. The centripetal force of the victims in this area lies in whoever can save them from starvation, and whoever is the savior they appreciate. Therefore, today, when the National Government is strengthening its political position with the cooperation of friendly nations, it must closely monitor the importance of the centripetal force of these vast victims and strive to win it. The way to win is to ensure that disaster relief is handled with "urgency," "sincerity," and "practicality." We respectfully offer this to the authorities and hope they will act quickly.</p>

<h3 id="e2">British Member Straphogie Claims Japanese Army Has Knocked on the Door of India. Ainami Discusses the Defeat of British Troops in Arakan, The Attempt to Counterattack Burma Has Been Completely Shattered. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th, Central News Agency - News received from Melbourne today, General McWhorter's headquarters issued a public announcement stating: The Japanese Air Force recently bombed an important base of the anti-Axis forces in the Wai Ai area of New Guinea again, the extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th, Central News Agency - London News, British Member of Parliament Lord Straphogie recently declared: The British army's counterattack against Akyab has failed, which has enabled the Japanese army to knock on the door of India. He went on to say that Chongqing's position is very dangerous, and Chiang Kai-shek does not have sufficient weapons and military rations to block the advance of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from London: Ainami, a war correspondent for the Chronicle, published an article in the newspaper on the 17th, titled "The Reasons for the Failure of British Troops in Arakan," which stated that the reasons for the failure of the British army in Arakan were roughly five: (1) The Japanese army gained valuable experience in jungle warfare during the previous battles in Malaya and Burma. This time, they fully applied this experience, making it impossible for the British army to cope. (2) The British and Indian army officers and soldiers are not familiar with jungle warfare tactics. (3) The British army field commander still adopts the consistent tactics or desert warfare tactics used in the northwestern border area of India, and did not adopt jungle warfare tactics. (4) Due to the jungle, the supply to the British army is very difficult, so it was unable to outflank the Japanese army from the side. (5) The supply and transportation did not utilize inland rivers, etc. In short, the failure of the Arakan campaign was due to unsound strategy and tactics. The British army was far inferior to the Japanese army in terms of quantity and attack power. At the beginning of the operation, the British army's goal was to recapture Hile, repel the Japanese army from the Arakan coast, so that the army, navy and air force could counterattack Burma in the future, and try their best to drive the Japanese army out of the border area of India, and try to prevent the Japanese army from attacking the Calcutta military industrial area, etc. As a result, because the ships and landing craft did not arrive, the attack on Hile failed, and instead of capturing the mouth of the Mayu River, it attacked the Dumberkula Taideng area first, which was a big mistake. After the Japanese army cut off the retreat between Mongdora and Kiton, the British army was forced to retreat backward.</p>
<p>Germans Praise Japanese Soldiers' Bravery</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency - Since Major General Tanikawachi, the head of the news department of the Japanese General Headquarters, explained the battle of Attu Island on the 17th, the German people have understood the details of the battle situation in that area, and all praised the spirit of the Japanese army's brave defense. The Nazi Party's organ newspaper "People's Observer" published an opinion on the 18th using the battle in New Guinea as an example, stating the views on the development of the battle of Attu Island, and said that recently, American newspapers have published reports from war correspondents about the battle situation between the Japanese and American forces in New Guinea, and the description of this report is also very interesting for the battle of Attu Island. At present, the US military plans to completely expel the Japanese army from New Guinea Island, but the Japanese army's combat power is strong, and the US military has no chance to take advantage of it. Land battles have been at a standstill for several months. According to news from the Times Weekly, the anti-Axis forces launched an offensive in order to obtain a jungle on New Guinea Island. As a result, 6,212 Australian soldiers and 4,118 American soldiers were killed in battle, but they still did not achieve their goal. These casualties are 50% more than the number announced by General White Leimi, the commander of the anti-Axis ground forces in the Southwest Pacific, which is really incomprehensible. From these facts, to interpret the battle situation of Attu Island, no matter how it evolves, it is believed that the Japanese army will launch a brave and desperate defense, and the US military's attempt will be shattered.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese General Headquarters Officially Announces That the United States Attacked Japanese Hospital Ships As Many As Nine Times <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:00 on the 19th that from the beginning of this year to April, seven imperial army hospital ships were attacked by American aircraft and submarines, for a total of nine times. Among them, the "Arabia" Maru, the "Ural" Maru, and the "Buenos Aires" Maru were bombed and injured, with slight casualties. Note: The main items such as the ship name, ship type, tonnage, and loading method of the above ships have been notified to the enemy by the country that manages Japanese rights.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Director Hori Issues Statement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency - Hori Koichi, the director of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, issued a statement on the 19th regarding the British and American illegal attacks on Japanese hospital ships, which stated that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American authorities and their troops have repeatedly resolved to take despicable and shameless inhuman acts against our military and civilians. We have pointed out and protested against each resolution, but because the development of the war situation is becoming more and more unfavorable to Britain and the United States, the illegal acts of Britain and the United States against our non-military facilities are becoming more and more fierce, and it is almost impossible to know where they will end. Especially since the beginning of this year, there have been several incidents of enemy aircraft and submarines attacking our country's hospital ships. The enemy's deliberate and barbaric actions are truly inexcusable. Judging from the following facts, it can be clearly understood that the names of these hospital ships were notified to the enemy with sufficient time before sailing and through proper national procedures, and according to international regulations, each ship has extremely obvious markings, so it can be seen at a glance that it is a ship with a humanitarian mission. However, the enemy knows that this is a hospital ship, but deliberately attacks it. Afterwards, they cunningly claimed that they did not recognize it as a hospital ship, or that they had instructed their troops not to attack hospital ships in a one-sided excuse, attempting to shirk their responsibility. This kind of behavior of Britain and the United States not only violates the Geneva Naval Warfare Treaty, but also tramples on humanitarianism, which is an evil deed that is not allowed by both gods and humans. Moreover, Britain and the United States often shouted to uphold humanitarianism and advocate respect for international obligations, as if they would never do any illegal acts. However, the falsity of their words and the shamelessness of their actions have been proven by facts, and the contradiction between their words and deeds has been completely exposed. Our government has repeatedly protested to the governments of the United States and Britain through the country representing its interests regarding the enemy's atrocities. Now, the names of the hospital ships that have been attacked, the situation at the time, and the damage are recorded as follows: (1) The Arabia Maru was sailing at low speed in the port when it was entering Yangon on January 4th. It was suddenly bombed by three enemy Unified-type aircraft. The enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed at low altitude, dropping more than ten bombs, but all of them fell about ten meters away from the ship, causing slight damage. At that time, the weather was clear, the cloud height was above 5,000 meters, and the visibility was extremely good. (2) The Ameili Maru was attacked by an enemy aircraft at 4:20 AM on January 30th while sailing outside the port of Rabaul (4 degrees 12 minutes 38 seconds south latitude, 152 degrees 17 minutes 45 seconds east longitude). The enemy aircraft first dropped four bombs, all of which fell behind the ship, and then strafed with machine guns. We suffered no damage. At that time, the ship's night markings were fully lit with lights and were extremely obvious. (3) The Mani Cila Maru was attacked by torpedoes (two shots) at 11:20 AM on March 4th at 136 degrees 17 minutes east longitude and 5 degrees 36 minutes north latitude. It immediately turned the rudder, so it was not damaged. (4) The Ural Maru was sailing to Rabaul on April 3rd. At 2:59 PM on that afternoon, it was dive-bombed by enemy aircraft at 2 degrees 47 minutes south latitude and 150 degrees 7 minutes east longitude. It was directly hit by one bomb, and several bombs exploded nearby, causing considerable damage. Six members of the medical team and one crew member were killed, and six members of the medical team and four crew members were injured. At that time, there were slight thin clouds in the air. (5) The Fusang Maru was bombed by enemy aircraft three times on April 15th while sailing to St. Trent Island, but suffered no damage. The situation is as follows: (a) The enemy aircraft dropped a flare and two bombs from an altitude of 2,500 meters in front of the bow of the ship. The bombs fell 500 meters away from the bow of the ship. (b) The enemy aircraft dropped a flare and a bomb from an altitude of 1,500 meters in front of the bow of the ship on the starboard side. The bomb fell into the sea 400 meters away from the port side (35 degrees angle). (c) The enemy aircraft finally dropped a flare and a bomb from an altitude of 2,000 meters in the middle of the port side. The bomb fell into the sea 200 meters away from the middle of the port side. Also, on the 16th, after the Ural Maru accommodated patients on the island, it was bombed by enemy aircraft four times and strafed with machine guns twice from 6:13 PM to 8:22 PM on its return voyage. Although there were no casualties, the hull was slightly damaged. It was found that the moonlight was bright and the ship's night markings were fully lit with lights when the enemy aircraft bombed on those two days. (6) The Buenos Aires Maru was sailing on the Hong Kong sea on April 15th. It was suddenly attacked by a torpedo from an enemy submarine at 3:45 PM on that afternoon. The hull was slightly damaged and seven people were injured. (7) In addition, the hospital ship Ruide Maru, which was notified to the enemy as a hospital ship on October 28th of last year, was also bombed by enemy aircraft at 10:30 PM on April 27th on the Gogo Sea, and was hit by 20 machine gun bullets. In addition, it should be noted that recently, German critics have pointed out that the American army on the North African front has no discipline at all. American intellectuals are also deeply dissatisfied with the American army's lack of discipline. For example, Paul Baldwin, a military commentator for the New York Times, recently inspected the North African front and said: "Americans, whether they are citizens or will be soldiers in the future, must strictly abide by discipline." He also sighed and said: "The American army still lacks the technology of commanders." Moreover, the enemy's atrocities are too numerous to mention. I still remember that when American aircraft bombed Tokyo on April 18th last year, they even strafed innocent schoolchildren with machine guns and blindly bombed civilian houses. Only the British and American troops can commit such barbaric and shameless acts. The enemy troops have no discipline and lack morality, so they take such illegal actions. If they are allowed to exist, there will never be peace, justice, and humanity in the world.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on a certain war front, the Japanese Army Air Force today attacked the frontline base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Jian'ou Airport. The Japanese bomb squadron departed from the base at a certain time and advanced towards the airspace of Jian'ou Airport. They braved the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army and bombed the airport fiercely. The runway under repair in the airport was hit by bombs again and completely shattered. Japanese aircraft also bombed military facilities of the Chongqing army outside the city, and fires broke out in various places. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to the defense area. It is reported that the Chongqing airport in Jian'ou is the frontline base for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to attempt to bomb Japan. It has been actively prepared and expanded before. It was severely bombed by Japanese aircraft twice on the 4th and 8th of this month. All military facilities and runways were destroyed. Afterwards, the Chongqing army actively rushed to repair it, but this time it was bombed again and completely destroyed, and it cannot be used again.</p>
<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from a certain place in Hunan, two Chongqing aircraft of type P-40 flew to the front line of Hunan Province on the afternoon of the 19th. They attempted to counterattack in the sky at an altitude of more than 7,000 meters. The Japanese army aircraft immediately cooperated with the ground troops and took off to intercept them. As a result, one of them was shot down, and the other fled in panic.</p>

<p>Taiyuan, 19th, Central News Agency - The Japanese army units on the Shanxi front are constantly besieging the Chongqing "18th Army" in the steep area north of the Taihang Mountains. On the 6th, they again attacked about 500 people of the Chongqing "Pinghan Guerrilla" and an "Xingtai Independent Brigade" entrenched in Shuimatou (20 kilometers east of Junji Pass), and continued to clear the remaining Chongqing army around the area and north of Junji Pass. The Japanese army, which was also carrying out a mop-up operation near Songyan Town, is also gradually expanding the war results. So far, the Chongqing army has suffered many casualties and captures in both places, and the Japanese army has seized countless military supplies.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency - The delegation of plenipotentiary representatives of France for the return of the special concession in China gave a banquet at Longmen Restaurant at noon on the 19th to entertain our Foreign Minister Chu and all the members of the reception committee and their entourages. At 4:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu, in the name of the chairman of the Franco-Belgian Alumni Association, hosted tea and refreshments at the association's headquarters at No. 48 Beiping Road for the Chinese and French members. During the meeting, Chairman Chu and Counselor Bospan, the plenipotentiary representative of the French side, gave sincere speeches, and the atmosphere was harmonious. It did not end until after 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency - Since General Pang Bingxun joined the peace camp, Chongqing's internal situation has suddenly shaken, especially the old Northwest Army formerly led by Feng Yuxiang and the old Northeast Army currently wandering in remote areas. It is reported that Yu Xuezhong, Tang Enbo, Feng Zhi'an, and Ma Zhanshan are now quite regretful of their past behavior. It is also said that Ma Zhanshan is stationed with tens of thousands of miscellaneous troops in the harsh and hot Ordos, and is only under the supervision of Fu Zuoyi's army to maintain his remaining breath, and Ma's lung disease is gradually becoming serious, so he seems to be extremely painful.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to news from Chongqing, the Chongqing "Military Affairs Committee" spokesman did not admit the matter of General Pang Bingxun's participation in the peace movement until the 18th. He deliberately distorted the facts about General Pang's decisive participation in the peace movement, and gave a perverse interpretation to the fact that more than 70,000 officers and soldiers participated in the peace movement. Looking at their intention, it is obvious that they are trying to suppress the activity psychology of the Chongqing army and the general public. This can explain the embarrassing situation of Chongqing.</p>
<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency - The Hunan Front reported that the summer offensive operation launched by the Japanese army this time has caused fatal blows to all aspects of Chongqing's military, economic, and political affairs. Now Chongqing is also afraid of the Japanese army continuing to advance into its inland areas. In this new operation of the Japanese army, Chongqing's greatest weakness of lacking the power to resist the war has been fully exposed. For example, in the annihilation battle on the Dongting Lake, Sun Lianzhong, the acting commander of the 6th War Zone of Chongqing, actively promoted the implementation of a counterattack with all forces in order to reverse the situation, and seemed to have considerable confidence. However, since the start of this operation, the Chongqing army's judgment on the operation has been completely wrong because the Japanese army has taken the initiative. If the Chongqing army really wants to stop the Japanese army's advance, it needs at least several divisions of troops. However, the Chongqing army only used a certain division of troops to engage in the operation. This kind of operational guidance is tantamount to suicide. Therefore, Peng Weiren, the commander of the 73rd Army under Sun Lianzhong, first fled after issuing a war order to the troops under his command with the decision of the heads of various army commanders and division commanders. His irresponsibility and the ugly state of losing confidence in the war of resistance have been completely exposed.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of Education authorities have noted that the number of young people from various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere coming to Japan to study has been increasing daily. However, there are no comprehensive and unified policies regarding the assessment, education policies, and goals of international students. To establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to establish a guidance plan for international students. Therefore, they have discussed specific plans with the Greater East Asia Ministry and related ministries. On the 18th and 19th, they held the first Conference of the Association for Education of International Students. Attendees included Mr. Nagai, Director of Specialized Education Bureau from the Ministry of Education, Mr. Nishizaki, Head of University Education Section, and representatives (all heads of discipline) from 23 schools including Tokyo Imperial University, Kyoto Imperial University, and national universities, higher vocational schools, and middle schools with the most international students. The discussion items were: (1) Matters concerning the educational policy for international students in universities and higher vocational schools; (2) Matters concerning the admission of international students in universities and higher vocational schools; (3) Other explanations. School representatives also put forward the following opinions: 1. Establish guidance principles for the education of international students; 2. Matters concerning methods for providing sufficient preparatory education, especially learning Japanese, for international students receiving university or higher vocational education; 3. Establish and improve preparatory education institutions; 4. Stipulate the number of international students in universities and higher vocational schools, and distribute international students in a planned manner to avoid concentrating them in a few schools, especially in Tokyo; 5. Concerning the admission standards for students; 6. Regarding the dormitory issue for international students, efforts should be made to ensure that they live in good families or dormitories and live together with Japanese students; 7. Employ dedicated educators who are capable of educating international students, and pay attention to cultivating dedicated teachers; 8. Seek to increase the number of female international students, hoping that they will understand the true intentions of Japan and help develop friendship and cooperation. In addition to coordinating with relevant ministries in the future to realize this as soon as possible, the Ministry of Education has also appointed representatives from six schools including Tokyo Higher Normal School, First High School, and Tokyo Women's Medical College as special committee members to prepare a draft of a new plan to guide international students. The special committee is scheduled to meet on June 3 to review specific plans.</p>

<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters announced the following battle situation on the 18th: (1) Italian Air Force bomber squadrons carried out attacks and reconnaissance along the African coast, and attacked anti-Axis light cruisers and medium-sized cargo ships at the port of Bougie, 113 kilometers east of Algiers. (2) Anti-Axis air force bomber squadrons carried out air raids on the western coast of Sardinia. (3) The Anti-Axis air force attacked Axis ships in the Strait of Messina and was shot down one plane by German escorts. In addition, one plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire along the coast of the Strait.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The London Standard Evening News solemnly stated yesterday that it is still difficult to say that the United States has controlled the Mediterranean. The general opinion that anti-Axis convoys can now sail from Gibraltar to Suez without further disturbance is not entirely accurate. Lord Winster, Secretary of the British Admiralty, told a reporter from the Standard Evening News that he believes the Mediterranean has become a "no man's sea" and that fierce naval and air battles will still occur. Anti-Axis countries may be able to dispatch emergency convoys through the Mediterranean, but all actions will be large-scale military operations, and slow and essential convoys will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. We must not forget that in addition to the efficient Axis air force, Italy still possesses a strong navy. Therefore, every anti-Axis convoy will require a strong escort. Moreover, the continued threat of German submarines to anti-Axis ships goes without saying. In short, anti-Axis transportation in the Mediterranean is still difficult and dangerous.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Italian Daily editor Gueda wrote that after the end of the North African campaign, the war between Britain and the United States against Italy has begun a new phase. Currently, Britain and the United States are doing their best to intensify the psychological warfare against the Italian nation, and their purpose is clearly to end the war against Italy as soon as possible. Britain and the United States are indiscriminately bombing Italian towns, hoping to coerce the Italian people and shake their morale, and thus drop various leaflets and issue radio appeals to the Italian people to make a separate peace with Britain and the United States, but the enemy's propaganda has not explained to the Italian people that this "peace" is the total destruction of the Italian nation. Gueda concluded that the psychological warfare of Britain and the United States will certainly fail this time.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Washington Conference Interrupted Due to Waiting for Stalin's Reply; Churchill Reviews War Situation in US Congress; Canadian Prime Minister Arrives in US to Participate in Consultations <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency special correspondent Lintman said today that the current interruption of the Washington Conference is because President Roosevelt has invited Stalin to hold a meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and is now waiting for Stalin's reply. Not only political circles in Washington make such judgments, but also observers in neutral countries hold the same view, and President Roosevelt also said that the interruption of the anti-Axis conference was not due to his discussions with his special envoy to India, Phillips. At the same time, the arrival of President Roosevelt's special envoy Davies in Kuibyshev has caused a great stir in the US Congress and the offices of various exiled governments in London. According to neutral journalists, whether Stalin accepts the invitation to meet with Roosevelt and Churchill and the issue of whether the promise to the European policy is binding not only caused the political conference to stop, but also the military conference was suspended before Stalin's reply was clear. President Roosevelt's concern for Stalin's reply is due to two reasons. Based on domestic political reasons, President Roosevelt must strictly abide by his own nation's policy of self-determination, which President Roosevelt has repeatedly mentioned recently. Regarding this point, the London Times reported yesterday that American public opinion has gradually approved an international agreement and expects to establish principles for the determination of land and borders, but Roosevelt and Congress dare not start on this issue before receiving a reply from Moscow. On the other hand, the exiled governments demanded clarification on what the fate of the countries they represent will be after the anti-Axis countries win. They argued that if they cannot obtain guarantees that they will not be sacrificed for the Soviet Union's ambitions, they cannot convince the public of the need for anti-Axis armed intervention and sabotage. The Washington Conference has been hindered by this issue since its beginning, and the problem is even more significant on the eve of awaiting Moscow's reply. American leaders seem to want to attribute the stagnation of the anti-Axis political and military plans in Europe to the Soviet Union. The anti-Axis side believes that the Katyn Forest incident made the small countries realize the fate that the Soviet Union left to them, which is one of the difficult reasons. Another reason is Stalin's stubborn attitude and his non-participation in the Casablanca Conference and the Washington Conference. The anti-Axis side said that this fact has caused the initiative of the small countries to stagnate, but without the active cooperation of the small countries, the success of the anti-Axis offensive in Europe is doubtful.</p>

<p>— Tokutomi Iichirō</p>
<p>(7) Monarchy in England</p>
<p>Every Englishman is concerned only with his own convenience. In any situation, they first plan for themselves and then handle matters arbitrarily. Even if the king is dissatisfied, they arbitrarily expel him from the country. If it encounters a colony of the British Empire that wants to separate and become independent, it immediately uses loyalty to the king to reverse its collapse.</p>
<p>If the crown is so important, why haven't they established the fundamental principles of the crown? As the saying goes, "Make the rope after seeing the thief." The rope that the English are using here is almost rotten. This responsibility lies not with the British royal family but with the British constitution. Anatole France once said:</p>
<p>"No Englishman is as superficial and vulgar as he appears. In their subconscious, they are actually extremely subtle and profound, and not easily discerned."</p>
<p>No matter how unreasonable and illogical such English people are, they will proceed with a iron heart, regardless of everything, if necessary.</p>
<p>The British constitution compares the king to the chairman of a limited liability company. Loyalty to the king is the rope that maintains Australia, Canada, South Africa, and even India.</p>
<p>The British monarchy was quite strange after the mid-Victorian era. Queen Victoria wore mourning clothes for the death of her husband, Prince Albert, and did not enter or leave public places, living a widowed life. However, among the English, there were still people who were unhappy, and thus republicanism became a practical issue and was brought up in Parliament. Chamberlain, Dilke, and Fawcett were staunch advocates of republicanism.</p>
<p>At this time, Crown Prince Edward appeared in social situations and was praised by people, and the situation eased somewhat. But the Queen regained some popularity in her later years. The Queen's virtue can be said to be that she was a self-disciplined person. The Queen's political documents are extremely vast. How the Queen communicated with the politicians of the time can be seen from this.</p>
<p>For example, she directly pointed out to Gladstone, an old politician who was nearly eighty years old, that his speeches were too激进. In the selection of cabinet members, it was quite difficult to pass the list proposed by the Prime Minister without any changes. Also, in the selection of the Prime Minister, because there are many leaders of political parties, it is not easy to order someone to form a cabinet quickly and often goes through many twists and turns. How did the Queen exercise her power? Crang and Hart published a book entitled "Queen Victoria's Political Power" from the Oxford University Press in 1935, which explains it very clearly:</p>
<p>"She was quite strong in her likes and dislikes, especially in the middle of her reign, she played with the Jewish Prime Minister Disraeli. She was also firm and strong, and the most clean in the British court. Some people in the world say that she treated the strong Scottish man, John Brown, as a servant and pampered him too much, but this is just a joke and cannot become a reason for criticism."</p>
<p>In short, during the Queen's more than sixty years in the world, it was the golden age of monarchical politics in England, and the British throne became more and more firmly consolidated here.</p>
<p>Succeeding the Queen was Edward VII. Edward VII was still the Crown Prince before the age of sixty. However, during these many years, he had considerable activity in social aspects on behalf of the royal family, but he was not allowed to participate in political matters. Gladstone once suggested to the Queen:</p>
<p>"Why not show him slightly important political documents now?"</p>
<p>The Queen refused:</p>
<p>"National secrets should not be treated carelessly."</p>
<p>Originally, Edward VII was given extremely strict education under the strict supervision and regulations of the Queen and her husband. Even the color scheme and patterns of the Crown Prince's lapel decorations had to be selected by the Queen during his student days. However, that strict education produced the opposite effect, creating such a completely bad young man.</p>
<p>The three tricks of heavy drinking, fighting, and extravagance in the world were all prepared for the Crown Prince! When he grew up and became the Crown Prince, he did not speak of England but of the European continent. The work done by the Crown Prince was sometimes as a judge in fraud gambling cases, and sometimes as a witness or reference in divorce cases. The Times issued a warning about the Crown Prince's actions, and the Queen specially expressed her gratitude to the editor Taylor. The Crown Prince also made a statement to the Archbishop of Canterbury that, regardless of what had happened before, he would never cause problems related to gambling in the future.</p>
<p>But Edward was by no means just a profligate and playful person. On the one hand, he indulged in horse racing, gambling, speculation, and other bad hobbies, but he also paid close attention to the movement of world diplomacy and was very concerned about what the public liked. In any situation, he did not forget to do his best for the country.</p>
<p>Some say that the British Crown Prince learned about the secrets of the political world from the mouth of a French prostitute and changed the relationship of opposition with France, and Britain and France became allies. Before long, even Russia joined their group, which may not have been his power. However, Balfour and others felt that his efforts were not enough and hoped for even greater effects.</p>
<p>The same is true of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. When Prince Ito was in Russia and discussed cooperation with Witte without success, he said on his way back to the country that he wanted to pass through London. At that time, it was the pleasant time near Christmas, which according to custom was not suitable for receiving foreign guests, but he didn't care. He said to the Prime Minister Salisbury at the time: "How about hosting at the Prime Minister's residence?" And he himself promised a formal audience. It can be seen that his attention was meticulous.</p>
<p>Also, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japan raised funds in New York and London, promising Japan to pay a certain amount of interest, and even though they are now enemy countries, we deeply remember this. Also, in the 40th year of Meiji (1907), when Prince Fushimi Sadanaru visited England, Edward VII specially ordered the play "The Mikado" to be suspended during the Prince's stay. That was naturally to show respect to the Japanese royal family and to the Japanese prince.</p>
<p>He ascended the throne at the age of over sixty and died after ten years in power. British society, during the Edwardian era, became increasingly decadent. However, in political terms, it cannot be said that it has reached a dead end of no plans.</p>
<p>Even if Edward VII had faults, or even sins, as the head of state, he was firm and unwavering in his guidance of national policy. Even if the strategy of managing the country cannot be said to be without regrets, it can also be said to be somewhat satisfactory.</p>
<p>George V had neither the bad reputation of his father nor the popularity of his father. He was a monarch with no achievements and no faults. Now we want to talk about Edward VIII. (翔: Translated from the May 5th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e28">North China Disaster Victims Await Assistance: Chief Executives Chen and Ding Urge All Sectors to Exert Utmost Efforts in Fundraising and Promote Thrift to Aid Disaster Relief <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide relief to the famine in various provinces of North China, Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, made a special trip to Shanghai and, jointly with Mayor Chen, invited leaders from the city's gentry, merchants, and other sectors to a tea party held at the International Hotel yesterday (the 19th) at 4:00 PM. More than one hundred people attended. Minister Ding personally delivered a speech, instructing all sectors to promote a thrifty disaster relief movement. Mayor Chen, due to illness, was unable to attend in person and was represented by Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue. Representatives from the North China Sojourners' Association in Beijing gave an on-the-spot report on the disaster situation in North China. The tragic conditions deeply moved all who heard it, and they unanimously expressed their sympathy and willingness to fully assist the government in raising donations to aid the affected compatriots. All parties anticipate that Shanghai alone can raise 100 million yuan in donations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>Those invited to attend yesterday included Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Qin Runqing, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Guo Shun, Huang Jiangquan, Jiang Shangda, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Xiaochu, Zhang Lianfang, Xu Langxi, Li Sihao, Li Ze, Shen Siliang, Zhou Zuomin, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Pan Sansheng, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhao Jinqing, Kui Yanfang, Zhu Boquan, Chen Shaowei, Feng Jie, Zhang Yipeng, Zheng Hongyan, Shao Shuhua, and others, as well as foreign friends such as Kiyomasa Hikogo and others. Representatives from North China included the Hebei Sojourners' Association, the Henan Sojourners' Association, the Tianjin Sojourners' Association, etc. Representatives from the North China Sojourners' Associations in Beijing and Shanghai included Zhang Yingjun, Li Zifeng, Guo Xianru, Li Bojiu, Jing Yaosan, and Wang Fansen.</p>
<p>Tea Party Proceedings</p>
<p>At precisely 4:00 PM, the guests arrived one after another. First, Minister Ding delivered a speech, followed by Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen. Subsequently, representatives from the North China Sojourners' Association in Beijing, including Zhang Yinghua, Guo [...], and Li Zifeng, reported on the disaster situation in various provinces of North China. Finally, speeches were given by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Yipeng. The event concluded at approximately 5:00 PM. During the proceedings, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, deeply moved by the severity of the disaster in North China, expressed his sympathy and generously donated fifty boxes of the most valuable imported cigars he had in storage. These cigars are currently unavailable on the market, with each box valued at over 1,000 yuan, making the fifty boxes worth a total of 50,000 yuan. He offered to donate them for charity sale to aid disaster relief in North China.</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>"Today, Mayor Chen and I have organized this gathering, providing light refreshments, to await the leaders from all sectors of the city in order to raise funds for the disaster in North China. I am deeply grateful to all of you for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend. Mayor Chen is unable to attend in person due to illness and has specially appointed Secretary-General Zhao to represent him. Regarding the disaster in North China, I, in my capacity as the head of the responsible ministry, have a few suggestions to offer to the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Importance of Shanghai's Cooperation</p>
<p>This disaster in North China is exceptionally severe. The extent of the disaster area and the number of victims are truly rare. Chairman Wang is extremely concerned and has already ordered the allocation of a portion of relief funds, and has instructed the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food, among others, to handle relief efforts separately. However, the disaster area is vast, and relying solely on the government's efforts is not enough. It is necessary for powerful forces in the private sector to jointly plan and coordinate in order to achieve significant results. Shanghai, as the economic center of the country, has a greater concentration of human and material resources than the inland areas. If the people of Shanghai can fully assist, the results will be more easily achieved. Therefore, we attach particular importance to this fundraising effort in Shanghai and have particularly high expectations.</p>
<p>Promoting Thrift to Aid Disaster Relief</p>
<p>However, in recent years, due to rising prices, the lives of Shanghai citizens have also been quite difficult, leaving them with a sense of being overwhelmed and stretched thin. Therefore, we do not expect them to give everything they have. However, there are still many people in Shanghai with means, and their consumption on entertainment and lavish spending is also very high. Therefore, we do not ask them to give everything they have, but we urgently need to promote thrift to aid disaster relief. If each person can save a penny from non-essential consumption and donate a penny, the collective power of the majority can yield a large sum that can save many disaster victims. This method of thrifty disaster relief only requires donors to reduce a little unnecessary enjoyment, without feeling any pain, but it will provide immeasurable benefits to the victims of the disaster, who will be endlessly grateful. Therefore, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai, especially those with means in the private sector, will promote the movement of thrifty disaster relief to extend a hand of sympathy to the victims of the disaster in North China.</p>
<p>Three Fundraising Methods</p>
<p>Secondly, the fundraising methods we have planned for Shanghai include grand opera performances, charity football matches, charity horse races, and so on. What I have just asked everyone to do is to reduce consumption, asking you to save money from reduced consumption to aid the disaster victims. What I am asking you now is to actively support these entertainment programs being held for fundraising, such as opera, football, and horse racing, and to set aside some of the money you originally intended to spend elsewhere to spend on these three areas. This will not only provide entertainment but also aid disaster victims, which can be said to be killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Establishing Fundraising Organizations</p>
<p>Finally, we should not be discouraged by the large number of disaster victims and the vastness of the disaster area. We should do our best with whatever strength we have. As for the organization handling disaster relief, in addition to the North China Emergency Relief Association already organized by the North China Sojourners' Association, some gentlemen have suggested that an organization be formed voluntarily by people from all sectors. This is a good idea, and the detailed methods will be announced after further study. In short, the government will take a leading and supervisory role, while the actual work is hoped to be undertaken by people from all sectors, ensuring that every drop of water flows into the public good and does not lead to any abuses.</p>
<p>All of you present today are leaders from all sectors of Shanghai and are powerful members of society. I hope that you will promote and assist in raising relief funds for the disaster victims in North China. I believe that Shanghai alone can certainly raise a large sum of money in the shortest possible time to aid the disaster victims in North China."</p>
<p>Secretary Zhao's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, saying in brief: "North China has suffered a severe disaster at a time when the nation is facing many difficulties. We should all feel particularly touched and show sympathy. Especially in this environment, the people of Shanghai should provide the greatest possible assistance. In his speech just now, Minister Ding indicated the key points: (1) the government should come forward to provide relief, (2) the people of society should spontaneously initiate [activities], and (3) [everyone should] contribute donations, especially to aid our starving and freezing compatriots. This is a matter of utmost urgency, otherwise tens of millions of people will be difficult to rescue. This city is the economic center of the country, and there should be no shortage of warm-hearted people who are eager to help others. In the past, Shanghai has been enthusiastic in donating to disaster relief efforts, demonstrating a good performance in fundraising. Therefore, given the widespread suffering and unbearable misery of the disaster victims in North China, we must resolutely carry out widespread fundraising. Moreover, the central authorities currently have concrete plans for fundraising in Shanghai. In order to fulfill the expectations of the central government, all sectors of the city should work together to achieve complete success, especially in this era, paying particular attention to this and making special efforts. The Shanghai Municipal Government will uphold the intentions of the central government and strive to promote this in the short term."</p>
<p>Speeches from All Sectors</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Yuan Ludeng, in addition to expressing great sympathy for the disaster in North China, universally hoped that all sectors of the city would contribute according to their abilities and, at the same time, hoped that this extensive fundraising would involve division of labor and cooperation in order to achieve significant results and complete it as soon as possible. (2) Mr. Lin Kanghou said: "Relief is like fighting a fire. The disaster in North China is severe, and this city must fully mobilize for relief. Now that the government is leading the way, relief should be swift. I urge the central government to advance funds for relief first, followed by donations from the people, which is the most important way to provide emergency relief." (3) Mr. Zhang Yipeng's speech mainly stated: "The disaster situation in North China is severe, and the people's government is sincerely providing relief to the affected compatriots. We should also assist each other. In addition to praying for the government to advance funds first, we also hope to issue disaster relief public bonds. Furthermore, Central China should prepare and transport grain, and we further hope that North China will exchange goods that are scarce in Central and Southern China. In this way, not only will the resources of the North and South be exchanged, but they can also be greatly circulated."</p>

<p>Regarding the fundraising for the disaster in North China, this newspaper has been receiving enthusiastic responses from all parties in recent days. Extracts of the main points are provided below to give a glimpse.

However, remembering that relief is like fighting a fire, we hope to not only donate enthusiastically but also [act quickly] [...]. I think that among the five million citizens of Shanghai, at least one-fifth have the means to donate. There are over a thousand rice shops in Shanghai, let's say one thousand, and if each shop donates a minimum of one hundred yuan, the total will be 100,000 yuan. I hope to exceed this number, and I will offer sincere prayers." – Liu Zhaofei (2) "Your newspaper has been thinking of the millions of disaster victims in North China, embracing the spirit of saving those who are hungry and drowning, and making a call for help. Your noble character is admired and praised. Mencius said, 'All men have a mind which cannot bear to see the suffering of others.' How can I, Fu Sheng, lag behind others? I hereby respectfully offer one thousand yuan in Joint Reserve Bank notes and ask you to kindly forward them. I am endlessly grateful." – Yang Fusheng</p>

<p>In order to unite overseas Japanese officials and civilians and vigorously promote the construction of the Greater East Asia New Order, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China has decided to integrate the Wing-Supporting Movement for the Promotion of Asia in Central and Southern China in order to maximize efficiency. After consultations with various groups and active preparations, the concrete plan was formally decided on the 18th by the Wing-Supporting Movement Adjustment Committee. The content was announced on the afternoon of the 19th by the Embassy Office. The plan is to form an organizational body jointly by all Japanese residents in Central and Southern China, tentatively named the "Organization for the Promotion of Asia in Central and Southern China."

<p>Also, two Group B matches starting at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Starting tonight, the Shanghai Volleyball League has only three matches. The first match starts at 7:00 PM, Group B1: Peide vs. Gulian. The former has three wins in three matches and shares an undefeated record with the Russian Children's Team. The latter has two wins and one loss, and its strength is also very strong. Following that, Group B2: Huoqing vs. Huafeng. The highlight will be the Group A match between Donghua and the Soviet Union. Based on the performance of the two teams in the group, Donghua defeated Zhongbei, while the Soviet Union lost to Zhongbei. Therefore, Donghua has a higher chance of victory. However, in reality, although Donghua has national players Tan Yongzhan and Chen Xuechong, Yu Yuzi, and others, its strength is on par with the Soviet Union, and there will surely be an exciting performance. Tickets are three yuan.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e43">"Economic Police" <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers reported that the Economic Police of the Central Police Academy are about to complete their training and will be assigned to service. Generally speaking, although police administration in our country has been carried out for many years, the lack of active improvement in the past has resulted in the public lacking a good impression. Economic police is a new undertaking, and it is sincerely hoped that they can invigorate their spirit and bring a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly commented on improving police administration. Economic police is an important part of police administration and an important tool for promoting wartime economic policies. The general points to be noted are the same as for ordinary police, but from an economic point of view, the following three points deserve special attention:</p>
<p>(1) Economic Knowledge: Economic police, as the name implies, should focus their work especially on economics. The police officers themselves should strive to enrich their knowledge of basic economics. For example, they should have clear judgments and quick decisions when inspecting goods and investigating prices. If they are slow, negligent, or indecisive, both the public and private sectors will suffer losses.</p>
<p>(2) Service Spirit: Economic police should avoid negative fault-finding and punishment and instead provide positive guidance and persuasion to the general public. Some people often do not intentionally break the law, but simply do not know the rules or procedures. In such cases, they should adopt a sincere guiding attitude and provide as much advice and correction as possible within the legal scope to reduce the public's confusion.</p>
<p>(3) Integrity and Honesty: The integrity of police officers is paramount, and the integrity of economic police is especially important. Otherwise, they will find fault in everything, make things difficult for everyone, and even "frame up" people to achieve the purpose of unwarranted extortion. As a result, they will only disturb the people. This is a bad habit that economic police must avoid the most, and it is a point that the police administration authorities must be most wary of.</p>
<p>At this initial stage of economic police, it is deeply hoped that everyone serving as economic police will be able to demonstrate their rich knowledge, excellent spirit, and noble character to advocate for the improvement of general police affairs and set an example for general police officers.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Ministry of Industries Approves Resignations of Sixteen Industry Supervisors; All Control Work to Be Authorized to the General Association of Commerce <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The sixteen trade associations under the National General Association of Commerce, after being designated by the Ministry of Industries to form a preparatory committee and organizers within a limited time, are now actively preparing for their organization. The soap and candle industry, chemical industry, and leather industry have completed preparations and are scheduling founding conferences. The remaining thirteen trade associations are to be established this month. To supervise and guide the smooth organization of these trade associations, the Ministry of Industries designated Zhang Jun, Deputy Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office, Sun Zuji, Director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, Xiang Xun, Director of the Trademark Bureau, and Chen Zhong, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, as supervisors of the associations. It is now learned that Supervisor Zhang and others, believing that the organization of the associations is nearing completion and their tasks are nearing an end, and due to the heavy workload of their respective bureaus and departments, making it difficult to serve concurrently, have requested and been approved by Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industries to resign from their supervisory positions. All future affairs of these trade associations, as well as the control, allocation, procurement, and other matters related to various materials to be carried out by these associations, will be authorized by the Ministry of Industries to the National General Association of Commerce. However, the overall authority for material control still requires deliberation by the Material Control Review Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e45">General Association of Commerce to Handle Material Investigation Committee <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>To stabilize prices and ensure the livelihood of the people, the National Government, through the Supreme National Defense Council, approved the organization of a Material Investigation Committee, with sixteen members each from China and Japan responsible for material investigation. Based on this decision, efforts will be made to investigate the hoarding of materials in Shanghai. It is learned that the Material Investigation Committee will be handled by the General Association of Commerce, which will fully cooperate with the sixteen Chinese and Japanese members to thoroughly investigate the hoarding of materials. The National General Association of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 19th), though no official announcement was made, it is believed that the association had a detailed discussion on this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Ministry of Industries Defines Material Control Boundaries for this City <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the boundaries of the control line in the Dinghai area as stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the National Government's "Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Materials," the National General Association of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Industries to issue a map specifying the scope for compliance. The Ministry of Industries has now issued a sketch map of the Shanghai area's material entry and exit boundary areas. The control line boundaries are: North to Xiangyin Road and Shuidaian Road, West to Zhongshan Road, South to Shangnan Bus Station, and East to Xin Pudong Road and Pudong Road. It is reported that the General Association of Commerce has notified the Material Movement Permit Office to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Central Reserve Bank Plans to Adjust Loans to Same Industry <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The National Government, recognizing that the practice of hoarding in Shanghai was becoming increasingly serious, affecting rising prices and hindering financial stability, in addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the hoarding of materials, also instructed the Central Reserve Bank to adjust loans to the same industry, in order to strictly regulate the business of banks and money houses in lending to industry and commerce. It is now learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has been ordered to reduce loans to the same industry. At the same time, various banks and money houses, under pressure from the Central Reserve Bank to recover loans and tighten credit, and to assist the government in suppressing speculative activities, are carefully reviewing industrial and commercial lending, considering actual circumstances, and recovering unnecessary loans. According to reporters' inquiries with financial sources, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has reduced loans to the same industry by tens of millions of yuan to date. It will continue to recover unnecessary loans to the same industry, and is studying plans to readjust the loaning system, and, with the status of a national bank, to lead the same industries to be cautious in industrial and commercial loans. It is reported that the overall specific plan for this adjustment is currently being considered and planned by the head office.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Central Reserve Bank and Joint Reserve Bank Exchange Rate Stable, Restrictions on Carrying Funds Aimed at Suppressing Speculation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency reporters' interviews with financial authorities, there is no intention to change the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and Joint Reserve Bank notes, and the Shanghai exchange rate will remain as it is. The new standard for restricting the amount of funds carried between Nanjing and Xuzhou, which began last month, is due to the fact that speculators were often using small amounts of materials to carry out speculative activities for profit, and the measure is aimed at suppressing speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Chinese Stocks Resume Trading Yesterday Morning, Municipal Council Sends Personnel for Inspection <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the official resumption of business for fifteen Chinese stock companies, including Yongchang, Xingye, and Zhongguo, after obtaining business licenses from the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. The industrial and commercial sectors of the port city have long anticipated the resumption of business of these fifteen stock companies, believing that stock trading is not only a legitimate transaction for businessmen, but also a great help to the development of industrial and commercial enterprises. However, after the opening of the market by various Chinese stock firms yesterday, the Material Control Office of the Municipal Council dispatched personnel to various companies for inspection for a week to supervise the stock market. The market trends yesterday are described below.</p>
<p>The opening market prices of various stocks in the morning were generally weak, lacking enthusiasm, and trading was not brisk. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, the Sino-French Pharmacy withdrew to the Concession at noon, while the trading of the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory was still not deserted. In the department store sector, the Guohuo Company was stable, the Yong'an Company saw a few buyers, the new shares of the Xinxin Company were sparsely traded, and China Underwear stood firm. In the textile sector, Yong'an Textile Factory and Meiya Silk Factory were both firm, with prices rising slightly. The small denomination Sino-American Worsted Wool was uniquely strong, while the rest were flat. In the cultural sector, there were many seekers for the Shijie Bookstore, while the Shangwu and Zhonghua were both selling prices with few buyers. There was no lack of interest in public utilities, and the prices of Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Gas were slightly firm. The new shares of the Da Zhonghua Match Company were actively traded, and Nanyang Tobacco was no different from the previous day. It is also heard that the Zhongfang and Xinhe Two Silk Factories, among the foreign stocks, were actually founded by Chinese businessmen, so there is news that they will be traded on the Chinese stock market.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Soap Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>During the spring of this year, household soap, a product of the chemical industry, was subject to hoarding, causing prices to soar to a peak, but there was no significant actual sales, so it soon fell back. Currently, the market is in a state of irreversible decline. Last month, when soap prices were falling, the China Chemical Industry Society implemented a flat sale of 3,000 boxes of "Save Money" brand soap, stabilizing the rapidly declining black market. Recently, the black market price of soap has been lower than the publicly sold price. The National General Association of Commerce has approved the second batch of goods from the China Chemical Industry Society, amounting to 2,500 boxes, and to facilitate citizen purchase, it has been stipulated that each large peer receives four boxes and each small peer receives two boxes, for widespread distribution. The selling price remains the same as last time, and distribution will begin once all procedures are completed.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Authorities to Conserve Materials, New Businesses to Be Restricted <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>According to sources, the authorities, recognizing the need to conserve materials during wartime, will prohibit the manufacture of unnecessary goods. At the same time, the establishment of new businesses and factories that are deemed unnecessary will not be permitted. It is learned that the following new factories and businesses were established from January to March of this year: 70 banks and money houses, 18 grocery stores, 18 transportation and trade companies, 26 trust enterprises, 15 manufacturing factories, 9 insurance companies, 13 food and entertainment establishments, and 5 others, totaling 174. Among these, in addition to some unsound establishments being inspected by the authorities, some are also related to consumables.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance, noting that there are still trading activities in enemy currencies such as U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars on the market, which is inappropriate, has stipulated that from now on, all sales, transactions, or remittances involving U.S. dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and promissory notes and checks denominated in these currencies shall be strictly prohibited. Any possession or storage of the above currencies should also be strictly suppressed, and those who deliberately violate this will be punished upon verification. The Ministry has specifically consulted the Municipal Government for dissemination and compliance and to forward the notice for posting.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Hope for Thorough Investigation <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Material Investigation Committee, after being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, will convene its first decision-making committee in the coming days. Beforehand, relevant agencies will separately conduct thorough investigations into the hoarding activities of banks, money houses, insurance companies, and warehouses, and will carry out work to prevent hoarding. Once the first decision-making committee is held, these efforts are expected to be promoted in a more planned and forceful manner. The current work to investigate and prevent hoarding is generally as follows:</p>
<p>Banks and Money Houses: The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau has drafted a "Survey Form for Commodity-Secured Loans of Banks and Money Houses," instructing members of the Bankers' Association and Money Houses' Association to fill out the form and stipulating that the loan period shall not exceed three months. In addition, unregistered commodities, firms, and non-members of trade associations shall not be used as collateral. The contents of the survey form are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Company registration number, date; (2) Borrower's name, occupation, company name, representative name; (3) Address; (4) Loan amount; (5) Term; (6) Name of collateral commodity; (7) Unit quantity; (8) Storage location; (9) Remarks.</p>
<p>Insurance Industry: The Insurance Supervisory Bureau has instructed all insurance companies to report in detail the names, addresses, and storage locations of policyholders with insurance amounts of 500,000 yuan or more, starting from April 1. However, hoarders are cunning and avoid detection by taking out separate insurance policies, for example, dividing a 500,000 yuan policy into five insurance policies with each insurer covering only 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the Insurance Supervisory Bureau is still preparing for a more thorough investigation method.</p>
<p>Warehouse Industry: The Municipal Council has implemented material investigations on the 175 commercial warehouses within its jurisdiction, and is preparing to investigate non-commercial warehouses and small storage facilities owned by individuals. If the above investigation work is completed, it will be very useful for preventing hoarding. Summarizing the above developments, the Material Investigation Committee will base its investigations on the Municipal Economic Bureau, Police Bureau, Municipal Council Material Control Bureau, police stations, and other agencies. It is hoped that these agencies must conduct thorough investigations. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 19th Dalu Xinbao)</p>

<h3 id="e54">A Young Man's Lament <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Chang</p>
<p>Jie:</p>
<p>When you receive this letter from me, you must be surprised at first, and then vaguely search for my shadow in your mind, right? Indeed, we've been apart for too long.</p>
<p>You must still remember when the graduation ceremony ended, some people were loudly discussing the problem of further education: "Yanjing is too aristocratic!" "And Zhijiang is like this and that!" Some were ecstatic, singing songs loudly: while still using a toothbrush handle desperately beating a washbasin to keep time. Some were quietly busy applying Stan Cain and polishing leather shoes, tidying up their beautiful suits, preparing to meet their lovers. Some were packing their luggage, ready to return to their sweet hometown to comfort their mother who was waiting at the door. The spacious dormitory was in a mess, truly a scene of upheaval. What about me at this time? I had already quietly slipped out of the dormitory, walking back and forth in the quiet campus, my mind full of question marks. Further education? Of course, that would be great. Mr. Wu once invited me to his small room on the night of the graduation exam, very solemnly inquired about my future direction, and repeatedly told me in a solemn and benevolent tone: "You must continue your studies! With your superior aptitude and hard work, you have already completed middle school. You should think about how difficult it is for the country and society to cultivate you. It would be inexcusable not to pursue further studies!" Continue studying, who wouldn't want to, but… but, where would so much money come from to support me?</p>
<p>Finally, I succumbed to economic realities, leaving the school I had spent several years with, holding a stomach full of sorrow, and began to enter society with my youthful enthusiasm. It took an immense amount of effort, and I don't know how much time I wasted, before I was introduced by a distant relative to work as a clerk in a foreign firm. During this period, I suffered setbacks and tasted the bitter cup of life. Every day I went to the firm and lived a cramped life, enduring the disdainful glances and ridicule of others, which was unavoidable. Finally, I was affected by the war, the foreign firm dissolved, and I began my wandering life. Although I tried my best to find a job, in this society where I had no relatives or friends, no matter what job it was, it wouldn't land on me; so I submitted articles, did copywriting for others… Every day I sat in a narrow, dark亭子间, the floor was full of dirt, and on the small table was a mix of everything Chinese and Western. With great difficulty, I kept a small patch of clean space, and I sat there, filling white paper with black words with my right hand that hadn't yet lost its nerves. Everything else that could keep me alive, I had done. Sadly, a pair of shoes with their mouths open were still following me, this unpromising master, and if I didn't get a job one day, I would go hungry that day. And there was no way to do manual labor. I often held that broken diploma, silently shedding tears at that silver shield that had already rusted.</p>
<p>Whenever I had a little money, I always liked to go to a small restaurant to gorge myself, letting alcohol anesthetize my nerves, making me seem to leave this turbid world. Although I would feel sad that I was still lingering in this world when I woke up from the alcohol, I still liked to drink and let it control me. Because of my depression and my erratic crying and laughing after getting drunk, my cohabitants thought I was an incurable madman and were determined to throw me out with the landlord, but the kind landlord, a woman nearing fifty years old, understood my background, sympathized with me, pitied me, and often came to comfort me in her spare time, but what was the use? My empty little heart could never be filled.</p>
<p>I even wanted to commit suicide, ran to the banks of the Huangpu River, staring blankly at the torrential waters, but every time at the critical moment, I suddenly remembered what the principal said loudly on the stage at graduation: "Young people's way out is to struggle through thorns. Don't be discouraged by setbacks…". My courage to commit suicide disappeared, and I had to drag my heavy body home.</p>
<p>After living this irregular life for more than a year, I finally found blood in my phlegm, and the evening fever and cough told me that the terrible demon of "pulmonary disease" had come upon me. I seemed to see him stretching out his ugly hands and hear him laughing triumphantly.</p>
<p>Jie, please come once, for the sake of our three years as classmates, you wouldn't refuse, right? You used to have great hope for me, now please come and see a young man like me! Sincerely.</p>
<h3 id="e55">What is Genius? <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xian</p>
<p>People always attribute success to his exceptional talent.</p>
<p>A thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child writes beautiful calligraphy; mathematics, physics, and chemistry, the younger classmates in the class are the best, isn't that genius?</p>
<p>Moreover, if it weren't for the difference of genius, how could some things that you can do, I can't do?</p>
<p>Indeed, genius is the key element to success.</p>
<p>However, what is genius?</p>
<p>Children don't have many worries, they will put all their attention to answering a question if they find it interesting or if they will be rewarded; genius, is this great attention.</p>
<p>Edison said: "Ninety-nine percent of a genius is the sweat of work." Previous degree of self-cultivation can strengthen and determine when you do it if you can do it or not. Therefore, genius, is work. The accumulation of self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Always see and hear more, study hard, be calm in case of an emergency, you will be able to cope with everything. You will be the greatest genius?</p>

<p>— Yun Fu</p>
<p>Recently, many people have embraced a negative attitude. Not only the elderly, but even the young. Especially those who have just come out of school. Young people, as long as we pay a little attention, we can always hear many of their pessimistic arguments. When walking on the road, if we happen to meet acquaintances, we often sigh as soon as we open our mouths. They have mostly been full of enthusiasm and pursued sweet dreams, but when their ideals are shattered by the dark reality of the environment, they begin to become negative and decadent. They disregard whether this attitude is appropriate, and also forget the importance of their own responsibilities and their impact on society and the country, and thus lose interest in everything and become despondent.</p>
<p>Decadence is the cause of all failure. If a person succumbs to the environment and becomes negative, then he will certainly not have a successful day. Only those with perseverance and courage can overcome all difficulties without becoming decadent. Because the success of a thing is never a matter of chance. It requires a person with perseverance to fight unyieldingly for a long period of time, removing many difficulties before reaching the goal. Look at the many heroes and great men of ancient and modern times, which of them did not reach their goals after countless failures in adverse environments? So the environment is only an obstacle. It only hinders our progress, and whether or not we succeed depends on whether or not we become decadent.</p>
<p>The adversity of the past few years cannot be denied. But we should not be decadent, because human desires are endless, and therefore the environment will never be completely ideal. We should fully use our own strength to try our best to destroy all the obstacles in our path.</p>

<p>The purpose of diligence and thrift is originally to maintain and develop life. If one is too diligent and thrifty and damages or harms life, that is not the way of diligence and thrift, but the thief of miserliness.</p>
<p>Only cares about his own face and never says a word of justice or fairness. Although such a person can earn small profits, he cannot gain great benefits; although he will not offend anyone, he also has no true friends.</p>
<p>In reading, it is not so important to memorize the words, but to be able to understand the main points. Because memorization can only get the outer form, or serve as the basis for plagiarism and quotation. Only by being able to understand the main points can one appreciate the essence and expound the truth. (Yet Paid)</p>
<h3 id="e58">I Am a Pawnshop Clerk <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jun</p>
<p>I, dragging my weakened body, have to wait by the counter every day, writing the same old things like "Cloth vs. Short Jacket"! "Clapboard Inside"! "Same Watch" etc. From 7 am to 11 pm writing tickets, banding bundles, auditing accounts, … I spent three years like this, and then I was promoted to counter clerk, or what the Shanghainese call "Chaofeng" (Pawnshop Clerk).</p>
<p>I still remember, several years ago, I saw some articles about "Chaofeng" in a newspaper supplement, vividly painting a portrait of Mr. Chaofeng. Looking at it, I certainly felt the same hatred, but also some different feelings. I thought that the majority of the reason was caused by the social environment. Chaofeng are just tools for the boss to make a fortune. Many are squeezed by life, or mistreated by the boss… so their accumulated grievances are only vented on customers.</p>
<p>Among the general trades, it is not easy for apprentices to successfully become bookkeepers, and then promoted to counter clerks. I, who was quite willing to study hard in this industry, was fortunate to get the title of "Chaofeng", but I was still locked in a birdcage-style store. I took on more "wind and fire". The price in front of the counter was still too low, and I was scolded by the main customer. They didn't think so, the business was not good, and my own income was also reduced, and the boss would blame me again. It's the same if it comes in too expensive, it's a loss.</p>
<p>Since I had taken on such a job, my life also took a turn. I did things to apprentices as if I was getting revenge. When it was time to eat, I pushed my empty bowl into the hands of the apprentices, and they naturally brought over the second and third bowls…</p>
<p>After the Incident, paper money depreciated, and prices underwent great changes. Speculators used their skills to further stimulate prices upward. In this way, we pawnshop business, which many people considered to be exploiting the poor, suffered a not small blow from the depreciation of paper money. The shrewd bosses had already changed their business, scattering the employees. Maybe some people thought that our employees could get a severance payment, but they were very disappointed. The boss must have made a fortune, a Chaofeng with no other skills got a few hundred yuan, using the money from our "deposit box" (the same as the small account of the conscience store is a split account), but broke a rice bowl.</p>
<p>My old boss closed down last summer, and I felt the fear of unemployment for the first time.</p>
<p>In this kind of society, no one can resist the scourge of life! I, who was called "Chaofeng", had no other skills besides the pawnshop business. In this situation, I was just waiting to starve to death. Even if I was lucky enough to find another employee, getting a few hundred yuan in salary, excluding my own board and lodging, there probably wouldn't be enough left over for other expenses. There was no source for the burden of my family, and no one wanted to starve to death. So I still ran to the familiar industry, but the days became more and more tense, from the hall of a large shikumen store to a single-room store to serve, and then drifting to the entrance of a general so-called "hotel", "tea room" also known as "legitimate entertainment venue", like a toilet-like small, outside hanging the old goods dealership Pawnshop working there, at this time is adding a "old goods ghost" title.</p>
<p>Due to the rise of "legitimate entertainment venues", the pawnshop business has developed in a distorted way, and it is also the golden age for employees, but it has instead caused some employees to go down the road to corruption and live a dissolute life.</p>
<p>The old boss earned money, changed his business, and made more money. Now the emerging small boss assets are increasing, me? Fortunately, my "luck" is a little better, I have no debts, but the wrinkles on my forehead have increased a lot, Chaofeng is still a Chaofeng, living a worried life in the current society!</p>

<h3 id="e60">Driven by Hardship, Teacher Temporarily Works as Cook, Hoping for Sympathy and Assistance from Society <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ying Qijun writes: I am no longer young, having previously served in my native Guangdong as a Chinese language teacher and a clerk-secretary. After coming to Shanghai, I switched to commerce, but my business failed after the incident. To save expenses, I sent my family back home and remained alone in Shanghai. Coincidentally, a certain residence advertised for a cook. Because I have a natural interest in cooking and have experience with Cantonese cuisine, I catered to the need for a livelihood and took on the role of head chef, which lasted for several years. In recent years, I have been unemployed again, moving between Beijing and Shanghai, finding it difficult to make a living. In addition, with frequent illnesses, I often find myself with an empty stomach and no means to survive. The reason, I believe, is partly due to my aloof personality and lack of close friends, but also my shyness to compromise, which is my inexperience in the world. Recently, I have been under immense pressure from the high cost of living, driving me to manual labor, where I am exhausted and dizzy. One day of work requires two days of rest, and even then, I cannot recover. Moreover, the wages earned from a day's labor are not enough to cover the cost of three days of thin porridge. This situation is truly the most difficult stage I have ever experienced in my life. Ziyou governed Wucheng with music and song, using a great talent for a small task. I, with my weak physique, perform manual labor, like using a razor to cut an ox. How different are these two situations! Should I continue to struggle? Then this life of hard labor is like cutting flesh to cure hunger. Should I simply resign myself to fate? Then this is passive and irresponsible, betraying the ambitions of a man. It is truly a dilemma, like a ram caught in a fence. Alas! In this bustling world, there are many cold stares, but on this weary journey, there may be someone who understands. Therefore, I humbly submit this letter, hoping to reach a sympathetic ear. Firstly, for my own sake, I seek sympathy from society. Whether as a clerk or a cook, I ask for a place to stay, so that I can first solve the immediate problem of food and have a place to stay to dedicate myself to the country and society in the future. Secondly, for the sake of the public, I hope that those who share my plight and misfortune (as reported in the newspapers a few years ago, there was a university graduate pulling a rickshaw) will have even stronger determination than I do, and that they will receive more sympathetic assistance and have a brighter and more promising future than I do. As the saying goes, "Help others succeed, so that you may succeed", that is the intention behind my words. (Note: This gentleman is an unrecognized talent. If he receives assistance from society and is given a job, such as copying documents or teaching, he would gladly accept, regardless of the salary. He can also provide a guarantor. Letters can be forwarded through this newspaper office.)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Eating Brown Rice and Its Cooking Method <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Haoyou</p>
<p>At a time when food is scarce and flour prices are high, reducing consumption is as important as increasing production. Therefore, when we eat rice, the first thing we should do is choose the most nutritious variety. In terms of rice available to the population of this city, most of it is brown rice. However, due to habits, many citizens dislike it and often mill brown rice into white rice, and the bran layer is only used for animal feed, resulting in the loss of valuable Vitamin B, which is both uneconomical and regrettable. Although pure white rice is easy to digest and makes you feel full, its nutritional value is lower than that of brown rice. According to Dr. Inoue Kaneo, a Japanese nutritionist, in his book "The Science of Nutrition": "Eating too much meat can lead to unhealthy conditions, such as arteriosclerosis, and the nutritional value is not as high as that of plant-based foods." This illustrates that plant-based foods are economical and nutritious. Recently, the Food Department believes that in this time of war, it is inappropriate to waste food, and is actively promoting the consumption of brown rice, in order to secure the people's food supply.</p>
<p>The cooking method of brown rice is different from that of white rice, because it has hard and soft varieties. The following is a brief description of the cooking method of brown rice for reference: Brown rice must be washed gently, not rubbed hard, to avoid loss of nutrients and vitamins. It is best to wash it the day before cooking. When cooking brown rice, the standard for adding water is generally one and a half to two liters of water for every liter of brown rice. The lid of the rice cooker should be heavy to prevent steam from escaping during boiling. Firewood, charcoal, or coal briquettes can be used as fuel, but the cooking time should be slightly longer than that of white rice. First, cook it over low heat, and after five to twenty minutes, it will boil, and steam will escape from the edge of the lid. After four to five minutes, gradually reduce the heat until all the steam dissipates, and let it stand for thirty to forty minutes. At this time, the rice grains absorb water and expand to their full size. Then, cook it over high heat until the rice juice is dried up, which takes ten to twenty minutes. The cooked brown rice is not only soft and palatable, but also very nutritious. However, one point is often overlooked: brown rice needs to be chewed thoroughly, more than thirty times for each mouthful, to aid digestion."</p>
