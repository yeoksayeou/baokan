<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭與日本海軍　慶祝日本三十八屆海軍紀念節</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭，從歷史家的看法，應該是三十八年前日俄戰爭的發展。三十八年前，日本新海軍創造了改變東亞歷史的功績；三十八年後的今日，日本海軍正在創造着改變東亞乃至世界歷史的事業。</p>
<p>在三十八年以前，我們東亞的形勢，處於非常危險的地位，那時英國對東方侵略的魔手，周然深入中國內地，而踏上沒落過程的帝俄，爲了消滅國內日趨膨脹的革命勢力，爲了維持其垂危的專制暴虐的統治權，爲了從東方掠奪土地爭取殖民地的霸權，時刻在準備着挑起對外的戰爭。而維新遝動之後未久，國家實力未爲外國了解的日本，正好成爲帝俄侵略的對象。假如帝俄竟在三十八年前戰勝了日本，那末，俄國的革命就不會成功，世界上是否會有一個蘇聯，固然將成爲疑問，就是二十八年前的第一次世界大戰的時間與性質及其發生地點，也會和以後的事實大不相同，那時，英俄或不免首先演出分割中國的慘劇。幸得新興的日本，一舉而擊敗了帝俄的主力，動搖了帝俄專制玫權的根抵，鞏固了當時日英同盟，造成了東亞的均勢，阻滯了第一次世界大戰爆發的時間，更重要的是　定了日本成爲東亞安定勢力的基礎，奠完了日本成爲太平洋保衛者的地位。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭前夕的形勢，幾乎與三十八年前日俄戰爭時相同，走上了没落過程的英國，和企圖爭取太平洋上　權的美國，正如三十八年前的帝俄那樣，醞釀成東亞戰爭的危機，利用東亞民族問的矛盾，實行其「以亞制亞」的戰略，製造了陷東亞人於絕滅之途的種種條件，如果英美人這種謀略一旦獲勝，東亞以至太平洋的形勢，自然要不知「伊於胡底」了。幸而日本繼承日俄戰爭的傳統精神，特別是日本海軍，挺身於浩瀚的太平洋上，從海上，從空中，到處打擊敵人，在極短的時間，逼得敵人從每一個島嶼撤退，遁出太平洋，使亞洲人的海洋和島嶼，重新回刊亞洲人手裏。其所表演的戰鬥精神，是日俄戰爭中的戰鬥精神之發揚與光大，照耀了太平洋和全世界。</p>
<p>不久以前，日本大本營海軍報道部編纂「大東亞戰爭與日本海軍」一書，更發揚了承繼日俄戰爭之光輝的日本海軍偉業的忠實紀錄，它活潑地寫出了大東亞戰爭日本海軍的胸間復活著日俄戰爭時日本志士的熱情與忠誠，它樸素地質實地描寫出日本海軍如何在大東亞戰爭中挺身血戰，和如何爭取了勝利。這部實畫出夏威夷海戰，馬來海之戰，威克島之戰，海軍降落傘部隊之戰，潛水艦作戰，爪哇海戰，澳洲與印度洋之戰等等驚人的現代海戰的塲面，這種不僅簪日本海軍描出英勇無敵的姿態，同時也替東亞民族提供出豐富的新知識，提供了現代海軍的作用，戰略，戰術，新兵器，新技術等等實際的知識。當此中國急須準備國防，建設海軍的時代，我們特把這部書譯成中文而出版，對於我國海陸軍人與一般愛國人民，似乎是最合時最珍責的一件禮品。同時，我們敢於相信，這部書中譯木的出版，也是我們對於日本三十八屆海軍節的最適當最虔誠的紀念。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之記載　舊報新抄（七）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美掙足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發抓了所向無知的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任難钜，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧作。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急志直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，摘爲新抄，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尚祈讀新注意爲幸。</p>
<h3>日皇誓衆　（載本報第一一四〇〇號光緒三十年十二月　初四日西曆一九〇五年正月初九日禮拜一）</h3>
<p>日本東京某日報云：明治三十八年正月一日，日皇臨朝降敕曰：上天眷佑皇圖鞏固萬世相承之大日本皇帝，今與爾忠誠勇敢之有衆誓。朕茲與俄人戰，朕之海陸軍，宜各奮忠忱，同仇敵愾，朕之庶司百執事，宜各勤爾職，以保佑我國家恪遵立國憲章，竭力盡心，無俾隕越，朕實有厚望焉。朕之所用期者，惟是國運文明，民心安謐，列邦友誼，敦篤逾前，俾維持東方時局，和平垂之久遠，威名權利，母或損傷，上下一心，確立將來之基址。朕夙以外交爲至要之務，旦夕厪念，罔敢有違。朕之有司，咸能深體朕意，輯睦友國，親原益加。不幸俄人肆其　張，股不得已而興師伐暴。然豈朕之初心哉。朕意我帝國之所重者，首在保全韓境，此意未嘗一日或忘。蓋以日韓累世交親，韓之存亡，我帝國實有關繫也。俄人明明與大淸及各邦的，盟誓昭然，乃竟佔滿洲，旣獲喙息之方，即肆兼併之志，日後滿洲土地，歸入俄版籍之中，尚能韓國力爲支持亞東，可守平安之局乎？朕故乘茲機會，商諸俄人，甚冀歷久相安，保全和局，迭飭有司，與俄會議，折衝樽俎，歷半載餘，俄人陽願輯和，陰繕完武備，海陸爭持，爾時朕尚思屈己以從，而俄人終始游移，全無誠意。朕見韓國瀕危迫漸，將侵及帝國利權。用是大興撻伐之師，與之戎衣相見。然朕之素志，仍甚望保障堅鞏，國勢平和，豈好戰哉？朕今告汝有衆，尚其各奮忠勇，努力從戎，以增帝國之光，用奏綿速無疆之績，實朕所深爲依賴者。</p>
<h3>日人歡迎大師情形　（載本報第一一三九七號光緒三十年十二月　初一日西歷一九〇五年正月初六日禮拜五）</h3>
<p>日本東京某日報云：我日海軍大將東鄉平八郎，海軍中將上村彥之丞，由旅順凱旋，豫定明治三十七年十二月三十日午前九下鐘越三十分時，行抵新橋火車站。先是，日人士之企慕二帥威名者，爭赴新橋瞻仰。火車站外週懸旭光徽幟，及各國國旗，五色繽紛，多以千計。東京參司會員，市會議員，各區會議員，商業會議所人員，相與結隊來觀，其數何止數萬。未幾，輪聲轆轆，馳抵站前。東鄉氏偕參謀長島村氏，參謀秋山氏，副官永田氏，戎服下車，上村氏同行者，則有參謀長加藤氏，副官官越氏，隨由勅使井上氏，御使武舟氏，皇后宮亮山內氏，東伏見宮，伏見若宮，二親藩，暨各宮御使，握手殷勤，同申敬意。旣而貴族院議長德川氏，衆議院議長松田氏，互相慰問。參謀總長山縣氏，伯爵松方氏，內閣總理大臣桂氏，宮內省大臣田中氏，海軍省大臣山本氏，及海陸軍諸將校，東京府知事千家氏，東京市長尾崎氏以下朝野貴紳數千人，亦以决歡迎道左。東鄉上村二帥，隨分乘宮內省所派馬車，直抵海軍省，沿途高呼萬歲之聲，幾訝春雷百面，所過之處，家家懸掛國旗。日比谷公園，燃放烟火數百架。海軍省大門之外，則由國民後援會支搭綵門，以表歡迎之意。二帥旣抵海軍省，宮中即遣侍從武官井上氏，大本營則遺少將村田氏，副官崛內氏來迎。二帥在大臣室中，的同海軍大臣山本氏，依禮接見，敬以香賓酒擎杯呼陛下萬萬歲，海陸兩軍萬歲者三。迨十一下鐘越二刻時，二帥同乘御用馬車，由海軍省入宮覲見日皇及后，有棲川宮侍從長德大寺氏，幹事巖倉氏，侍從武官長岡澤氏以下皆隨。從海軍大臣山本氏，軍令部長伊東氏，以及海軍將校咸分班侍立。日皇玉音徐吐，慰勞有加。二師隨將攻圍旅順以來，前後海戰情形，一一上奏。及退朝，日皇下詔，賜二帥曁海軍省大臣，軍令部長諸人午餐。洎午後二下鐘越二十分時始出，少頃，日皇復飭人齎賜二帥金質對時表各一枚，酒殽資各一封。島村氏以下各官，則各賜酒殺資一封，旋又以交殽一席，淸酒一罎，齎送東鄉氏府第。當晚東京市民擬大開歡迎之會。東鄉氏聞之，急具柬以辭，其言日：諸君盛情，僕所深感。惟念部下士卒，刻尚宣力沙塲，雪虐風饕，奇苦萬狀，獨僕蒙茲嘉　，情何以堪？僕之回京，實奉大本營穴召，密籌重要軍務，不久仍須仗鉞出征，敬謝諸君，愼母以逾分榮施，重鄙人之過也。於是歡迎之會，遂中止。</p>
<h3>論日本之強　（載本報第一一三七一號光緒三十年十一月　初五西曆一九零四年十二月十一日禮拜日）</h3>
<p>日本東海一島國也。論其疆域，則廣不過三百六十里，長不過七千五百里，面積不過一千六百萬方里，地方可謂狹矣。論其人民，則全國不過四千五百七十萬，幾內人烟稠密之處，每方里的有六千人，東北部戶口漸稀，至北海道則每方里祇有九十人而已，其民可謂廖落矣。明治以前，幕府搜權，國君守府，外患日逼，見欺強鄰，國勢寢衰，危若累卵，兆姓憂迫，幡然改圖，游學歐西，精研共法，上下一德，遂變舊章，政體則立憲，敎育則日盛，軍政則日精，商務則日擴，物產則日富，工藝則日良。三十年來，推究實學，孜孜矻矻，惟日不足，國逐進於強盛，可與歐西各大國頡颃。去歲以高麗故，中國東三省故，與强俄開釁，易玉吊爲干戈。當時環球各國，莫不爲日本慮，慮俄之大，慮日之小；慮俄之强，慮日之弱。一旦交戰，勝負可不言而分。乃相持將及一年，日非徒不敗，且能屢勝。俄人海軍，則毀其幾及全艦隊。陸軍則幾盡奪其所佔之地。俄爲虎狼之國，歐西各國，莫不畏之。乃日以東亞一小國，竟能塞旗斬將，敗其海陸之師，何共强也。論者咸謂日本自維新以後，政體則立憲，敎育則日盛，軍政則日精，商務則日擴，物產則日富，工藝則日良，非此不能收如是之大效。予以爲是誠日本強國之道，然其本原，猶非止此也。日之强也，在人人同具忠君愛國之情，無渙散，無乘亂，竭誠相向，同德同心。其視君與國也，如性命相繫然，離則即不能生於人世；而國家之所以視百姓，亦有生死與共之意。用能上與下一氣相聯，固結莫解，振興百度，無有弗舉，改革舊制，罔弗有效也。余友張君遊學日本，近嘗貽書曰：日與俄開戰後，全國精神，益爲振起，男子以全力注重軍武，盡行者之職。女子以全力注重敎育，盡居者之職。數百萬之義務金，咄嗟立辦。所謂義務金者，捐以爲征人禦冬需用之名。嘗有一老婦甚貧，共夫歿於中日之役，以上撫恤之金購一的指，常帶之以爲榮寵，近聞有義務金之捐，即以的指納之，收捐所以其貧，且曰此上之恩賜記念也，安忍收汝，老婦歸，拔刀斷其指，復至收捐所納之，曰：指已斷矣，安用此爲？收之。又有一小童，亦甚貧，嘗痛恨俄人，而義務金則貧不能納，乃賣餅於市，日以其所得捐之。此二事者，載之報章，傳之里巷，非無稽之言也。觀此，知日人忠君愛國之心，緊牢不可拔，共所以能抵抗俄人者，在此而已。豈徒維新而後，奮興一切之效哉？雖然，日本之强，其原在人民之忠君愛國，但不先從事於政體，軍政，敎育，商務，物產，工藝，則無以鼓其志而奮其神，此所以立國者，仍宜於政體，敎育，軍政，商務，物產，工藝，立其基而後始足以感發人民生其忠君愛國之意。若徒高言忠君愛國，而不先於政體，敎育，軍政，商務，物產，工藝，盡力爲之，必不能也。</p>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日海軍部隊，此次在南太平洋方面所獲之光輝戰果，己於本日發表，實是使日軍開戰以來之戰果，益增異彩。當大戰爆發之初，日海軍首即攻擊夏威夷，綜合其後馬來海戰等各决海戰，日軍所獲戰果，計擊毀敵艦艇五百零五艘，船舶四百八十四艘，擊落擊毀敵機四千八百二十六架，而創空前紀錄。今日海軍已把握戰鬥之主動地位，而粉碎敵人之反攻，並切斷美澳補給路。計自五月五日迄二十四日止，在該處水面已共擊沈敵船十三艘，合計十一萬一千四百噸其中被潛艇擊沈者爲一萬五千噸級油槽船二艘，計三萬噸，貨船六艘，計五萬七千噸，一萬一千噸級一艘，一萬噸級三艘，八千噸級一艘，七千噸級一艘，其他尚有運輸船一艘，三萬五千噸，又被飛機擊沈者，計有運輸船七千噸級，千五百噸級，四百噸級各一艘，總共九千四百噸。且日海軍部隊又常猛擊在南太平洋水域，及日本土近海出沒之敵潛艇，計自四月一日至五月廿日止，已共擊沈敵潛艇十七艘，其中被飛機擊沈者七艘，其他十艘，皆爲被驅逐艦所擊沈者。</p>
<p>馬尼拉二十六日中央社電　日菲島派遣海軍部隊某大佐本日在此間以歡迎大東亞戰下之海軍紀念日爲題，發表廣播演講，大意謂海軍紀念日，爲四十年前日本擊潰侵略者之挑戰，並奠定日本百年基礎之紀念日。英美欲圖制覇太平洋，制覇世界，日本則主張自已領域內天賦之當然權利。海軍紀念日，即爲暗示日本將斷然擊破英美之日。日本與英美之死鬥於日俄戰後，即已開始，大東亞戰爭雖爲長期戰，但勝利已操諸吾人，大東亞之新生不久必可實現云。</p>
<p>羅馬廿六日中央社電　義大利新聞報主筆蓋達，値此第三十八屆日海軍紀念節，於今日著論，盛讚日海軍在此東亞戰爭中之豐功偉績。當此之時，全國義民，更瞭解日海軍對付英美海軍之戰鬥力。且日海軍在太平洋中，旣能應付英美海軍綽乎有餘，在大西洋之德義海軍與在地中海之義海軍的責任，自得大事减輕。加之日海軍旣能順利堅握其印度洋之勢力，英美最重要根據地與反軸心軍需工業所需之原料，已剝削殆盡。蓋達續稱，現行戰爭最後勝利的最重要條件，爲獲得海上覇權，與阻止英美越海而抵達其最前綫。故軸心國必須對敵方戰艦與運輸艦，一一加以殲滅，即此一點，日海軍當居首功。英美在華府會議中，力圖壓低日海軍之設備，實爲極大謬誤，彼等妙不知精神上的力量，有時較物質上的力量爲大。在此次戰爭中，日海軍得其空軍之輔佐，無論在夜襲或登陸行動方面，處處顯示，偉大能力。前美國亞洲艦隊司令亞納爾中將，自承日海軍非美軍單獨能予擊敗，職是故耳。</p>

<p>任海長談話</p>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　五月廿七日爲友邦日本第三十八屆海軍紀念日。當茲日海軍雄躍於太平洋，威脅印度洋，進出大西洋之際，大東亞解放戰之完遂，指日可待。我國海軍再建，亦賴友邦海軍之協力，始奠根基。値茲佳節，友邦朝野一致熱烈慶祝，對此第一次之保衛東亞海戰，我國官民幷同感欣慰，對友邦海軍靈魂之東鄉元帥，山本元帥，廣賴中佐等聞名大將，允致敬念。記者特於二十五日拜謁海軍部長任援道上將，承發表談話，認日本海軍數十年來保衛東亞之功勳，堪爲楷模，並期將來中日聯合艦隊共同出現於太平洋面。茲錄任海軍長談話於後：「日本明治三十八年聖將東鄉元帥率領聯合艦隊，奮勇作戰，於五月二十七日殲滅帝俄波羅的海艦隊。這一次的偉大戰果，可以說赫赫於世界，所以日本即以此五月廿七日爲海軍紀念日，紀念這偉大戰功到現在已經有三十八年的歷史了。日本以此五月廿七日來紀念海軍，其意義實很深長，不但喚起民衆的愛國心，尤其於日本一貫的排除歐美侵略，保衛東亞完整的工作，實以是役爲發起。是以海軍紀念日的意義是充分表現日本道義的精神，到現在已成爲整個東亞道義精神的紀念日了。其範圍實已由海軍而擴大至全民族，由日本而闊大到整個東亞了。當時帝俄海軍勢力有稱雄太平洋之勢，日本爲已國生存計，爲東亞保全計，毅然與帝俄作戰，在大決戰中，日本海軍在東鄉元帥之指揮下，以其每戰必勝，無往不克之信念，卒將同等力量之帝俄海軍殲滅，虜其軍艦，俘其主將，戰果之偉大，曠世未有，此皆全體海軍將士上下一致，抱有忠君報國之至誠，故只計奮勇殺敵，不顧其他一切，此種決心至堪欽佩。到現在我們想起東鄉元帥激勵將士的時候，有皇國興廢在此一舉之訓詞，其慷慨激昂之姿態，實可表現我東亞民族之浩然之氣，自然不覺而爲之興奮到極度。」自大東亞戰爭發生，日本海軍即以傳統精神，協同陸空兩軍擊滅英美在亞洲之惡勢力，現在欣逢第三十八週海軍紀念日，是日日本舉國上下熱烈紀念，凡我東亞民族，幷同有所感，尤其我國新興之海軍將士，應當取法先進之精神，而共負東亞解放之責任。</p>

<h3>海軍魂（三）　三笠艦上的東鄉上將</h3>
<p>— 石井鶴三</p>
<p>「對於新來的敵口艦隊，誓死擊沉以安宸襟，」這是聯合艦隊司令長官東鄉上將，在指揮日本海大海戰前，對於天皇所關心的回答。這個時候，在上將的心坎中早已有成算。</p>
<p>不多時，明治三十八年五月二十七日，大木營發出第一報：「一接到發見故敵之警報後，聯合艦隊即行出動而準備擊潰敵人。是日天空雖淸朗，但波濤頗高，」下午一時三十分，我主力與敵主力初次相會，當彼此距離逐漸接近，而達八千公尺地點時，一直默默無言而凝視着敵人的東鄉司令長客，右手舉得很高，突然向左一揮。加藤參謀長理會長官的意向，便下令「艦長開足馬力前進」。於是衝到敵艦的前面去，而得到壓迫敵人前排的必勝優勢，砲轟不到半小時，勝敗大勢早已決定，推其原因，則實在是由於東鄉司令長官右手向左一揮之功。假設身體被敵彈擊中，而戰爭能得到最有效的結果，那也是基於必勝信念而出此，這種手勢的一揮是具有多末深造的意義呵。（濤：譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>東綫德空軍活躍　炸毀蘇大飛機工廠一所　德大規模肅清蘇遊擊隊</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德總統大本營二十五日正午，以公報發表戰况如次：（一）東綫之陸上戰鬥，德突擊隊已在數地區開始行動，（二）德空軍會猛炸蘇方鐵路設施，並轟炸伏爾加河中游地區蘇聯之大飛機工廠。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德國新聞社里事通訊員哈瑪上校稱，東綫大規模之軍事活動，雙方均在加緊準備中，蘇軍精强部隊，巳可見集中於庫班橋頭附近之高加索西區內。莫斯科與庫斯克間之中部，以及列寗格勒區莫斯科之南，更行重兵集合，確悉該處，已有不少兵器之展開，並有精强之坦克車部隊與機械化分隊。在庫班河下游集中蘇軍人數較少，但重要則工，衆信蘇軍計劃，對德軍南翼與中區北部作大規模之軍事行動，一如去年冬季之情形，德軍方面之意向如何，尚無所知，德軍司令部除準備抵禦，預料中之蘇軍夏季攻勢外，尚有不少師團與進攻之部隊，足資分配，故德軍在東綫之軍事行動，完全不受蘇軍行動之的束。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新開社訊據軍界消息，德軍於星期一日，則在德陣綫後方活動之蘇聯游擊隊，開始大規模掃蕩，其中一隊時由蘇軍自空中及水道予以接濟者，已被肅淸，德軍共破其碉堡一百二十餘座，其他游擊營壘二十餘處，滿貯大批軍火食料，亦被德軍發見，加以破壞。此次德軍出動，係由俄志願兵協助頗爲得力云。</p>
<h3>谷萩報道部長　在橫濱發表演說</h3>
<p>（續昨）器物或可盡量生產但人力則不然，英美對於海陸空三方面無數人之死傷病三者，究將如何補充，實爲疑問。又美英所視爲生命綫之海運，其船員早有顯著之消耗，其能率亦日形减退，凡此告爲確實之事實，在所羅門新幾內亞緬甸等彼我之空戰中，彼之犧牲十倍於我，此事已足以證明其因空軍將兵補充困難，故其素質亦極爲低落，再次，就時間問題言，戰爭愈持久，則愈利於軸心國方而無疑，日本刻在大陸及太平洋已確立政戰兩略之不敗態勢，一面戰事，一面建設，以戰養戰之方策正迅速順利見諸事實，此爲衆所週知，假以歲月，則日本已形成無論世界聯合之强力，亦不能擊破之態勢，此事已爲渝方及澳洲當局者所一再指出，大東亞戰爭並非破壞及消耗戰，而爲建設及生產戰，日本現因戰爭之結果，已完全成一資源國，在長期持久戰中，可發抓偉大之力量，美國在生產方面，至木年狄已達極點，此後之狀况，恐將下降，故戰爭愈曠日持久，戰力日趨衰弱者，亦爲美英兩國，姑舉一例，即由美英之船舶關係方面而觀，兩國之綜合造船能力，一年的爲一千萬噸，而其被擊沉者月的百萬噸左右，然則英美之船舶保持量，自必每况愈下，並且必臨打破其保持□□萬噸之時期。在美國第七十八屆議會時，羅斯福所提出之咨文中，曾謂一九四三年爲進攻年，決定於北方由阿留巾羣島反攻，於西方强化援渝，增强駐渝空軍及反攻緬甸，於南方鞏固所羅門羣島及新幾內亞諸地之基點，企圖緊縮對日之包圍陣，更倡首空襲日本本土，即有任何重大犧牲，亦所不惜云云。故今後戰局當多變化，或有一時局部之失利亦屬可能，但觀戰區之廣大，戰期之延長，一時局部之波瀾不足以影響最終戰局，亦不値一喜一憂，凡我國民，當團結一致，則確信戰爭之此途，必有光輝之勝利。（完）</p>
<h3>日皇裁可　後藤任國務大臣</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日柬條首相前爲適應戰局之進展，徹底發揮國內政治力，以整備完成大戰體制起見，曾於四月二十日，斷然改造內閣，且於二十三日更起用岡部長景子爵，專任文相。同時因大政翼贊會副總裁安藤紀三郞中將就任內相，該會事務總長後藤文夫，遂升任副總裁，茲日政府爲進一步謀求內閣强化，促進翼贊運動之積極發展，及加强政府與翼贊會之聯絡起見，復決定任用後藤氏爲國務大臣，今徵得該氏同意後，東條首相遂於二十六日上午九時，晋宮上奏，當蒙天皇陛下裁可，天皇隊下幷於十一時半，於東條首相倚立下。舉行親任典禮，同時情報局對此亦正式發表云。</p>
<h3>阿留甲羣島附近　不久將有大戰</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩廿六日中央社電　美國海軍評論家許勃特，昨日在英國廣播公司廣播稱，著名之美國海軍專家預算，美日兩國海軍，不久或將在阿留巾羣島有大戰。渠指出日本飛機之突然出現於阿圖島上空，可推定有日本航空母艦在阿留申羣島附近活動，因此即可推定該處地區，有大隊之日本海軍部隊云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城廿六日中央社電美海軍部，對於日大本營發表中關於日海軍航空部險及潛艇隊於阿圖島水域所獲之戰果，旣未否認，亦未承認，關於阿圖島戰况，美海長諾克斯，於廿五日接見記者團時，僅稱，關於阿圖島之戰况，除過去已於海軍部公報中發表者外，別無可述者，但戰鬥仍在繼續中云。</p>
<h3>山本元帥精神不死</h3>
<p>山本五十六大將陣亡！日本聯合艦隊司令長山本五十六大將陣亡，這不是夢，是儼然的事實。山本元帥首先出動擊滅夏威夷美艦隊，創海戰史上空前紀錄的大勝，先後爲日本所得到了。日水海軍尊山本元帥如慈父，兆億國民莫不敬仰山本元帥爲蓋世英雄。大束亞戰爭發動以還，歷有年半，海軍機上的人們，已成了太平洋的主人翁。山本元帥身先士卒，登機凌空，在廣泛數千浬的全綫，指揮作戰，不幸中敵反擊，忠烈英勇的名將，成了南方海上衛國的英靈。</p>
<p>嗚呼！山本提督旣以身殉，可是，我們所知的「山本精神」，是永久不滅，而擔當捍衛太平洋的任務！「山本精神」　動了後繼的數十數百靑年提督的身心，……大東亞戰爭在此一年半中，每一個人們的殉國熱血，達到了沸點。山木元帥的英靈，亦當鑒察，兆億國民大家起來，抱一貫不渝的決心，向前敵去銜殺！</p>
<p>山本五十六元帥，於明治十七年四月四日，誕生於新湯縣長岡市，原爲長岡藩士高野貞吉氏之四公子，生元帥時其尊翁已五十六歲，因之取名「五十六。」家風寒素，刻苦耐勞，幼而頴悟，會該地晋紳山本家，因後繼乏人，留以過繼，遂易此姓。元帥天生將才，自幼即有志於海軍，明治三十七年十一月，畢業於海軍兵學校，當時的同僚有鹽澤，吉田，島田各海軍大將，堀悌吉中將等，其時正値日俄戰爭激烈的時候，山本元帥以少尉候補生的資格，在第一艦隊日進旗艦服役，明治三十八年五月，參加日本海海戰，遭彈片波及，失去左手手指二枚，右腿也被大火灼傷。翌年政府頒給軍人傷痍章，爲國爭光而負傷的元帥，獲得了光榮的第一號傷痍記章。</p>
<p>大正四年，任海軍少佐，五年畢業海軍大學，八年爲駐美武官出國，悉心研究美國情形。未幾，元帥對於美海軍的熟悉，固不待論，即一般美國的民性，也有深刻認識。這是在美當時努力研究的結果。聽說元帥在美時，有下面這樣一段逸聞：</p>
<p>元帥在美國的時候，絕不出入於　紅酒綠的社交塲所，就是有空的時候，總到比賽塲去練習投砲彈的技術，他常說：『日本用頭腦不能做到的時候，我用臂力去解決。』</p>
<p>有一天元帥到阿那玻里斯的海軍學校去參觀，走進某教室，幣見黑板上畫着：太平洋上日美戰爭的作戰圖，當時美國敎官看見日本軍人來參觀，慌慌張張的說道：『正在教關於現在太平洋的講義，』元帥大搖大擺地踱進敎室，微笑道：『打攪你們了，改天在太平洋上相見吧！』</p>
<p>大正十年，華盛頓會議一開始，駐節波士頓的元帥，奉召到華盛頓，和現任軍令部總長永野大將，共同襄助幣原全權代表，厭惡妥協約元帥，曾經向全體代表透露過堅持到底的法心。同年十二月歸國，執敎於海軍大學，將共在美所學的精髓，完全傳授與子弟，又鑒於繼華盛頓會議之後再來一個海軍軍縮問題的緊張情勢，於是大正十二年，再度啣命出國，分赴歐美諸邦，同年晋升爲大佐，翌年歸國，任體浦航空隊首席教授兼副官。</p>
<p>元帥早就注重在海軍方面擴充航空力量，願以艱巨自任，傾力培養將來的空軍，就從這個時候開始了。</p>
<p>大正十四年，奉派爲駐美大使館武官，在海軍方面成了獨一無二的美國通。昭利三年任五十鈴艦長，復任赤木艦長。昭和四年進級爲海軍少將，同年的倫敦會議上，在首席委員左近司中將之下，以專門委員資格前往，輔佐若槻，財部兩全權代表，經華盛頓，倫敦兩次軍縮會議，元帥對於海軍航空力的前途，抱有充分確信。歸來之後，就將此理想付諸實行。昭和五年任海軍航空本部技術部長，昭和八年任航空戰隊司令官，努力訓練海軍航空隊。</p>
<p>昭和九年，特派爲日本帝國代表，赴。倫出席海軍軍縮會議預備交涉，『山本五十六，名震一時，周旋於老奸巨猾的英美兩國作戰部長之間，令人側目。當在英京活躍中，榮昇爲中將。昭和十年預備交涉完畢，不辱使命，保持對英美海軍力均等的日本一貫主張而囘國。在那决預備交涉時，現任松平宮相也和山本代表一樣極力排除英美策動，主張確立軍平等權，撤廢比率主義，表示絕不退步的嚴正態度。</p>
<p>昭和十年，任海軍航空本部長，昭和十一年十二月在永野海相之下任次官，翌年米內大將入閣任海軍大臣，元帥仍蟬聯次官，繼續輔佐米內大將。嗣後近衛內閣，平沼內閣時代，而米內大將依然留任，海軍內部，始終井然不紊，憑此軍政手腕，造成了今日的無敵海軍陣容。</p>
<p>昭和十四年八月，受命爲聯合艦隊司令長官，寄國家安危於一身，在風雲緊急的太平洋上，不對英美稱　一步，唯賴山本提督在生前，築成了日本海軍磐石之基。昭和十五年十一月，與吉田，島田兩提督同時榮昇海軍火將。在元帥率先指揮之下，積極訓練海軍，以備一朝有事之日，昭和十六年十二月八日，對英美宣戰的詔書下頒，使世界震動而又使世界海戰術一變的奇龔眞珠灣成功，就是元帥所建的不滅的金字塔，也就是元帥訓育下的海軍機的成績。過去二十年來，華盛頓，倫敦兩條約以後，日本海軍，一忍再忍，終在夏威夷一役，打破了對英美比率的弱點，創造歷史上空前壯舉。</p>
<p>天皇陛下嘉尚海軍的豐功偉績，對山本聯合艦隊司令長官，苒度賜予勅語勉勵，軍人的榮譽無過於山本元帥的了。元帥在接旨之餘，誓必鞠躬盡瘁，圖報聖恩。大束亞戰爭開始以還，日本海軍的赫赫戰功，使世界駭異，其成功固然是託福天威所致，可是元帥的多年辛勤而致此功果，也是一大原因。而元帥的治軍有方，時常親赴前綫，勉勵將士，或則慰問傷兵，和前綫將士共苦，前綫將士，得元帥如此躬親激勵，就振起了無限感奮。</p>
<p>卒於本月四日，在出動到前綫指揮作戰之中，壯烈陣亡。大海軍國的最高指揮官，捨身爲國而戰死者，除特拉法加海戰中納爾遜的陣亡以來，還是初次。成盼其凱旋歸來的全國人民，對於元帥的陣亡，不禁表示無限的哀悼。素抱與帝國海軍共存亡的元帥，能殉身於其手植的海軍機翼之下，也可謂是元帥的素志了。諺云：『死得其所』，元帥的殉國，可謂不負此生矣。（雲鵬：譯自五月廿二日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>艦齡標準</p>
<p>首由主席致詞，略謂：今日招待各位，乃因明日爲日本海軍紀念節，又値各位昨會參觀出雲艦，希望隨意發表意見，並在新聞上喚起貴國民衆，對海軍深切認識共重要，宜舉國上下，急起建設，昨所參觀之出雲艦，係明治三十二年造成，現已成舊式軍艦。蓋日海軍之建設與日俱進，按世界各國海軍標準上而言，巨型軍艦服役年齡爲二十四年，小型則爲十六年，故出雲艦僅供保衛海岸而用，故美國會宣傳讓渡英國舊艦五十艘，事實上無濟於事，我人不必重看。</p>

<p>日本在兩大海戰中收瘦兩大偉大紀錄，會予世界對海軍之新認識，一爲日俄海戰中日本擊滅帝俄艦隊，當時各國震驚，乃認爲大砲可以擊穿軍艦之鐵甲，於是各國紛粉研究大砲之火力。二爲此次大東亞戰爭中日海軍會出動海軍飛機，以魚雷擊沈英國威爾斯親王號，於是各國認爲目前軍艦應研究如何使軍艦避免飛機之擊沈，因此各國同時認識海軍應由空軍輔助，則收效更大云。</p>
<p>中國海軍</p>
<p>最後記者提出建設中國海軍問題，當承鎊田大佐發表偉論，謂中國在元朝已有强大海軍，曾遠征匃牙利等，是時日本尚未有如此巨船，日本建設海軍從明治起，經九十一年之光陰，方有今日。爲復與東亞應建設東亞强大之海軍，中日旣爲同生共死，日本當關切中國海軍之建議，故切望新聞記者能負起宣傳責任，務使全國民衆對海軍發生新認識，而舉國上下一致爲建設海軍堅苦奮鬥云云。　至五時半，乃告散會。</p>
<h3>廣田情報部長闡述　美移民法</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部長，於昨（二十六）日下午三時，在循例招待本市中國新聞記者團常會席上，對最近美國參議院會議提出之修正限制華人移民法案發表意見。</p>
<p>禁止入境</p>
<p>首先引述美政府排華法案之一的對華人移民法案，於西歷一八八二年間開始，而於一九二三年，由美政府予以正式通過，規定未歸化美國國籍之華人，禁止入境，即使因特別情由，而請求入境者，亦規定按照各國移民人數，不得超過對華數額，故每年僅准一百零七人入境。同時並亦限制日人赴美，以是日政府會提出嚴重抗議，由日駐華盛頓大使植原正直氏照會美政府，該照會當時措詞大意云：基於國與國之交往上，日本人民雖不歸化美國，應有入美境之權利，否則此項劣等待遇，實有莫大之侮辱，日政府對此，殊爲遺憾，但因日美兩國之友好關係，固須繼續維持，深望有所改善，如果依此規定，將來惹起重大後果，本大使實不能預料者。</p>
<p>澈底清算</p>
<p>當美接此抗議後，非但不予以改善，反使其一貫之作風，以抗議文字中所引起重大後果之語，認爲日本對美之威嚇，竟要求日政府召同駐華盛頓大使。當時日國民對此問題，引起莫大憤怒，復經迭决抗議，然反遭美之强詞奪理，日甚一日，未獲解決，以是大東亞戰爭之爆發，此移民法案，亦可謂作爲主要原因。吾人在以往所感之侮辱，當在此次戰爭勝利中，澈底淸算，以解決之。關於此次美參議員凱奈等，在會議席上，提出修改華人移民法案，實爲美在戰時一種權宜措置。考其用意，蓋美自知對渝物資援助之不足，斯引起渝方反感，尤其在目前，渝方有脫離反軸心國之趨勢，故美再施慣技，以修正移民法案，冀圖緩和，而拉攏渝方。我人按照華人之立塲而言，採用限制華人移民者，原不僅美國一國。</p>
<p>東亞之恥</p>
<p>即英與之領土如坎拿大·印度•澳洲·馬來•南菲及中南美等，且英在南菲聯邦通過禁止印人民所有土地法案，此乃排擠印人之法案，顯示英美均輕視東亞民族，爲東亞民族之恥，故渝與英美之合作，斷難達到最後目的。渝方反對東亞民族合作之態度，實爲渝方之錯誤。而此項美國移民法案，亦非僅爲對付華人之問題，却爲東亞民族十萬萬人民之問題。凡屬東亞民族，均應起而抗爭。故英美輕視東亞，不但中日兩國，須挺身而出，即全東亞人民，應羣起以驅逐英美在東亞之惡勢力云云。</p>
<h3>滬連對抗運動會　六月二十日正午舉行　中國選手兩天內登記</h3>

<h3>出售配給烟業規　並未發生效力</h3>
<p>據接近配烟當局方面指稱，另售烟商常將所派得之烟，以極少數依限價發售公衆，而將其餘轉銷他處，二週之前，華中烟草配給組合，曾頒討業規，惟即以「商號於配給香烟數量及受配日期應公布鬥首」一項而論，因另售商售貨之並無定時，而業已被破壞無餘，據昨日普遍調查結果，得悉華中烟草配給組合所訂業規，並未發生任何效果，而禁止兒童軋買限價捲烟之規定，事實上亦並未實行，配烟當局曾宜稱如零售商違反業規，當將其配給烟之供給予以停止據消息靈通方面透露，目前配給捲烟，常在夜總會等娛樂塲所發現，其售價則頗經抬高。</p>
<h3>阿凱第亞舞廳夜會</h3>

<h3>女敎員受辱身死　敎育界公憤</h3>
<p>住居平凉路三九三弄四號之安徽婦人劉王民氏，現年四十一歲，其十三歲子劉俊之，向在同弄聖心中小學讀書，本月十八號，劉俊之因在上課時與同學發生爭吵，受責於級任女敎師蘇益之，不料劉回家後哭訴其母劉王氏，不覺大怒，竟趕往校中，不問情由，將蘇敎員掌頰二下，蘇受辱之餘，忍氣吞聲，不敢與抗，詛至二十四日，劉又與學生張姓吵閙，回家後，其母即趕至校中，又施野蠻手段，除將蘇益之掌頰外，並在胸腹各部毆擊，致事後蘇忽然身死，由校長據情報告榆林路捕房，由華副探長姜麟祥探員陳福康擔任調查，將屍體舁又騐屍所候騐，一面將劉王氏拘又捕房，昨晨解送第一特院刑二庭，捕房方面除述明案情外，以蘇之屍體尚未檢騐，請求准將氏覊押，堵推事論劉王氏准予覊押，候騐明屍體再核，此事發生後，敎育界方面對此案發生殊爲憤慨，特於昨日連合同人，爲死者向各界呼籲，請予援助，並悉業於昨日下午四時，携帶呈文，至市政府社會局等各機關請予援助，死者家屬僅有一姊一幼弟，生活輟伊負擔，故身後景况殊爲悽凉，喪費亦須賴親友設法。</p>

<p>經濟界　譯論</p>
<h3>糧食庫券的意義</h3>
<p>國府發行四萬萬元糧食庫券，委託中央儲備銀行向各方放出。</p>
<p>此項政策，對於食糧問題及一般物價問題，頗多貢獻。發賣糧食庫劵所得的資金，全部運用於糧食部主管的米穀收買配給事業方面，不但可以促進上項事業的能率，而且能吸收上海及其他都市的大量游資，對於物價問題的癥結，投下一種有效辦法，在經濟上意義，是相當重大的。</p>
<p>糧食庫券的發行方法，除先山華方銀行及保險公司，企業信託公司等認購相當數額外，並勸大衆購買，日方金融機關亦儘量認購。又對於放出的庫券，在必要時可由儲備銀行買回，或以庫券作爲担保而貸款，用意極爲周詳。綜觀上項辦法，再就和平區之經濟狀况推測，預料糧食庫券的發行，必然成功。</p>
<p>尚有一點，値得注意者，此項糧食伸券，期間不過一年，而且利息極低，祇有四厘半。如果能迅速消化，獲得預定成績，那就等於和平政府在財政上得到偉大的勝利。</p>
<p>發行四萬萬元糧食庫券，吸收游資，給予正當出路，此舉對於一般物價政策，定有重大貢獻。抑平物價的途徑，除吸收剩餘購買力之外，別無他途。金融機關的自肅，與收縮放款，固然對於抑平物價的在漲有重大作用，然而今决發行糧食庫劵後，自肅過程，必然更進一步推進，物價的漲風，也可以易於抑制。四萬萬元的數字，與囤貨的數字相較，決不太大，但是吸收了四萬萬元游資，其在經濟上的意義是不小的。</p>
<p>我們希望國府當局以萬全的努力來推動庫券的消化。同時相信日本方面也必以全面協助來支援國府，以達到此目的。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十六日大陸新報）</p>
<p>儲備銀行</p>
<h3>承受甲種糧食庫券　推廣轉讓銀行錢莊　庫券幷可以抵押借款</h3>
<p>中央備備銀行爲適應金融界之需要，乃決定將該行所承受之甲種糧食庫券，推廣轉讓與各銀行，信託公司，錢莊，以及私人等。蓋此種庫券之發行，對於金融機關非但有利於游資之處置，幷可引導游資納於正軌，成爲資金運用上之良好機構，同時藉糧食庫券之消化市面之富裕資金，得以還流於中央儲備銀行，目前中國上下一致所關切物價問題之解決，實屬裨益匪淺，又該行對於凡購得糧食庫券之金融機關，倘日後因頭寸需要，得按原息隨降予以收進，幷得以該庫券抵押，向中央儲備銀行辦理低利率之借款。</p>
<h3>中農實騐所廖所長　蒞滬視察棉種塲</h3>
<p>中央農業實騐所所長廖家楠氏，率簡任技正顧伯明，於昨日蒞滬，由實業部上海棉業管理處邵處長陪往北橋棉塲視察，廖氏對於該塲之設施，及正在進行中之各種試騐工作，頗爲嘉許，邵處長復詳談上海棉管區之計劃，除北橋繁殖塲外，尚有浦東楊思繁殖塲，及崇明繁殖塲等，而對於整個棉作推廣，又擬供獻中央，劃華中爲三大棉業推廣區，即蘇淮蘇北及皖北爲一區示範塲，設於寗屬附近，以寗屬爲中心，蘇浙浙東爲第二區，以上海爲中心，沿長江江西，湖北皖南爲第三區，以九江附近爲中心，並請中農所作具體之指導，及培育中下級技術人員，分派各該地以應急需云。</p>

<h3>澈查非法囤積籌設　物資調查委員會</h3>
<p>國民政府爲澈查上海中外商民非法囤積大量主要物資起見，特經第十四决最高國防會議通過在上海設置物資調查委員會，由中日當局指派中日關係機關長官十六人爲委員，共同組織之，現正在積極籌備進行中，一俟當局將該委員會組織規章及法令擬訂就緒後，即於最近期內在滬召集中日雙方委員開會，正式宣佈組織成立。</p>

<h3>設置油糧專委會　商統會尙未決定</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會自成立後，內部組織機構除各處組織已完成，幷進行辦理物資移動許可事宜外，對於下部各業聯合會部門正在積極督促組織中，現化學工業及皂燭業聯合會及粉麥專業委員會巳經成立，其餘各業同業聯合會的於本月底左右均可决第籌組成立，關於油糧專業委員會，昨傳已經正式籌組成立，據中央社記者向商統會方面探悉，殊不可靠，且該會考慮油糧專業委員會是否需要組織，尚未決定，故外傳各消息，諒係虛僞宣傳，該會正從事調查。</p>
<h3>各業聯合會　展期半月成立</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會之下層機構各業同業聯合會，原限於本月底前，完全組織成立。茲悉商統會方而鑒於目前各聯合會之組織工作，雖在積極進行，但僞時過暫，本月底前恐難完全組織成立，故再展期半月，限各聯合會至六月十五日爲止，全部宣告成立。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股初頗鋒芒，於午刻突又轉平疲。乃股價久跌後，各方人心一時未易振作之故。求現賣戶仍在見機而動中；五底之前，恐將暫呈盤旋狀態。交易不旺，新藥業顯著向榮，中法藥房及新亞藥廠均巳昂近關口。公用業之閘北水電與華商電氣呆站前價，成交稀徵。南洋烟公司少變動；大中華火柴獨見低落。永安公司回升較勁，新新及國貨公司同見軋升。文化業呆定逾恒。商務中華世界三書局均無變化。紡織業之永安紡織與美亞綢廠均在進展中。其他各雜股如中興木業，景福杉機，通易信託市均堅定。久安實業，新益地產勢呈呆平。中國鐘廠仍疲，照票面始有買戶之外。金融業食品股均少成交。</p>
<h3>煤球不漲價　商店已有合法利潤</h3>
<p>近來盛傳煤球又將漲價，實爲空穴來風，目前煤球價格，可望維持原狀，幷無變更可能，至於用以製造煤球之原料（煤）屑大都來自河北及朝鮮兩地，因來源蟬聯不絕。存底復極充斥，但近今產價稍有增加，每噸計增中儲券七元，又運輸費亦較以往酌增十二元，但對於製造商幷未受到任何威脅，因煤球由廿五元一担增至卅二元五角（每噸六百五十元），廠盤每噸五百五十元，故廠商每噸可獲凈利一百元以上，另售商七十元之譜。又熟水店業同業公會，要求復售「熟水平價煤斤」，茲悉煤號公會對於該業處境頗爲同情，尤以派煤價格售給老虎灶燃用，現熟水店公會負責者猶在考慮云。</p>
<h3>新蠶豆運申不多</h3>
<p>民食輔助品之蠶豆，邇已屆出新時期，據聞開花之初，曾受氣候影響，近來風調雨順，收成尚稱不惡，大的六七成可卜鄉，惟一般民大都採作充飢，故運申數量難期過多。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>化工業　全國商統會下部機構之化舉工業聯合會，業已籌備就緒，於日昨召集全體會員開成立大會，計到蘇浙皖三省兩市會員代表七十餘人，商統會派張秘書長佩紳出席指導，主席盧志學報告籌備經過，詞後常經討論修正會章，選理監事，計當選理事盧志學許冠羣許曉初周邦俊專二十一人。監事錢念祖袁鶴松等十一人。</p>
<p>雜糧業　最近各地雜糧均將次第出新，各地區雜糧業聯合會爲討論產銷合作方針及分配事宜起見，特定於下月十日召開大會，屆時對於搬運等計劃當有詳細決定。又聞該會主席符前耕氏昨已專程赴京，商洽要公，同時米穀聯營社負資人陸文詔氏亦赴京請示中。</p>
<p>皂燭業　皂燭業聯合會籌備就緒，於昨日下午三時假八仙橋靑年會召開成立大會，查該聯合會由蘇浙皖三省各市縣，京滬兩特別市，及蘇淮浙東各地區內胰皂蠟燭製造業，販賣商同業公會組織而成。出席各地同業會員代表一百四十餘人，商統會張秘書長等出席指導，主席李祖範報告籌備該過，對論會章草案後選舉盧志學周邦俊等二十一人爲理事，韓祖康等十一人爲監事。</p>

<p>自從我們決定擊滅英美的意志，在太平洋上粉碎英美荷聯合艦隊以後，捷報頻傳聲中，第二次的海軍紀念日降臨了，這是第三十八屆的日本海海戰之歷史的戰果，和東亞民族之飛躍的發展之紀念日。現在回顧三十八年前的情况，實不勝感慨系之。</p>
<p>去今三十八年前，東亞的民族是奴隸的民族，印度是英國之忠實而豐富的乳牛，中國是英美之最順從的奴婢，日本是英國在東亞勢力之忠實的走狗。</p>
<p>然而現在我們挺立起來了。忠實的走狗之日本，爲了全世界人類，想粉碎主人之慾壑難填的野心，蹶然而起了。把英美從東亞驅逐出去。三十八年前的英國尙不過是貧弱的國家，美國還是一個孩子，但三十八年之間，英國從東亞掠奪了莫大的物資，勞動力，和金錢，把世界人民，頤指氣使這一付神態，似乎視爲當然的。</p>
<p>可是一旦日本海軍挺起來了，英國立即從第一流國家顛落下去，已變威第三流國家，美國被驅逐於阿留申，所羅門羣島的彼方。</p>
<p>（二）海洋民族裂造世界史</p>
<p>「海洋國民，一旦對海洋持有事大的決意的塲合，那就是歷史的轉變的意義。」這是平出大本營報道部課長的名譽，日本現在正向世界史的轉變中邁進着。</p>
<p>日本建國之始，就是海洋民族，在建國的大理想下，過去一年半以來，海軍國民爲突破所謂ABCD的包圍綫而英男奮鬥，或在狂濤掀天的北太平洋，或在炎熱如焚的南太平洋，從空中·陸上·水面·擊毀英美的戰鬥力，成就了震撼世界人士的大戰果。翻開世界史一看，希臘以薩拉密斯灣海戰而製造愛琴海文化，英國以特拉夫阿爾加海戰而把世界史變成英國的東西，凡此均歷歷在目。而日本以日本海海載而成爲世界的日本，東亞民族成爲世界的民族，東亞民族的前途，從此似更充滿了希望。所以我們現在在太平洋上舉起了古今世界歷史家祇在夢中見到的，英美必减的旗幟，想改造世界中，而一致協力地遇進着。</p>
<p>修正舊秩序以轉繫世界史，決不是輕而易舉的事業，前途阻碍重重，自不待言。我們根據建國的大方針。海洋國民而一旦決定了重大的意向，在大平洋上揭起了Z旗後，則應不顧一切的往前邁進。</p>
<p>希特勒元首曾說：「現在的戰爭，不是國家的滅亡，便是發展。」所以我們想起絕筆作「期七生報國的實踐」之書後，以悉尼軍港爲目標地，而踏上了不想生還的征途的特別攻擊隊十男士，不應沾沾自喜於偉大的戰果，應正確認識戰局的現階段及將來，向完遂戰爭之途邁進。</p>
<p>近來的報紙都說一九四三年即本年是決戰之秋。邱吉爾作豪語稱：「在明年或後年，打倒希特勒後，要永久解除日德義的武裝。」羅斯福作謀略宣傳稱：「今年是空襲日本本土的時侯。」太平洋艦隊司令長官尼密資科：『我們已經完成了毀滅日本工業地區的准備』，他們都勁起很地宣傳大空襲。假使這些言論不只是宣傳而是他們實際的決意，那麼我們就要趁早實行決戰，我們想在華盛頓舉打聯合艦隊之精銳的觀艦式。</p>
<p>爲了要在華盛頓舉行觀艦式，我們就不能不强調最後的五分鐘。『最初的五鐘』和『最後的五分鐘』，在任何事情中是切要的。『最初的五分鐘』，我們已完全勝利了，即美國首腦部大意地錯估日本海軍航空部隊的實力，雖也加以十二分的防備，但精銳的太平洋艦隊却變成眞珠灣港的藻屑。因此，現階段所殘剩的問題是『最後的五分鐘』。一九一八年，德國雖保持了優勢的戰綫，但仍變成戰敗國，那不是失敗於戰綫，而由於國內的崩潰。</p>
<p>所以我們不能不正確認淸戰爭的現階段，東亞民族，同甘共苦，一致協力，爭取這「最後五分鐘」的勝利。</p>
<p>（三）大東亞戰爭中海戰的形態</p>
<p>以前的戰爭，是一國的興隆，一國的滅亡的歷史，但現在並將來的戰爭，則是有關多數國家的興隆，多數國家的滅亡而爲極雜的複世界的戰爭，所以對抗國家大家都傾國家的總力，極人智的限度以戰。尤其在近代，因科學的進步發達而變成了所謂科學　，戰爭的形式，自平面的變成立體的其規模之大與複雜紛歧的狀態，終非過去的所能此擬。因飛機之急激的發達，致空軍的優勢成爲海戰上優勢之不可缺的要件。因此，以前的制海權，若無制空權，則絕對不能成立。總而言之，制空權制海權制中權若不能成爲三位一體，則在近代海戰中不能獲得勝利。</p>
<p>就第一項制空權而言，飛機的偵察能力相當於五六般巡洋艦的偵察範圍，其行程相等於艦隊一晝夜的航程。靠着在水中極度發達的潛水艦的合作，愈增大其成力。因而要秘匿隱蔽兵力的行動企圖，極爲困難。所以「最初五分鐘」的先發制人，首先成爲勝利的原因。若不能用種種方法在最初的一撃中粉碎敵人，便沒有勝利的希望。迄前次歐洲大戰爲止，停伯於嚴密防術下的港灣中之艦隊，可以安心休養兵力，補給食糧，修理艦身，綽有餘裕。但現在有了像我海軍航空部隊這樣優秀的飛機之後，即使太平洋上美國軍港的防衛是怎樣地鞏固，美國碇泊的艦船早就難期安全了。而且海上艦艇及成爲空中飛雷水中魚雷轟炸之絕好的目標，即在黑夜亦難倖免。美國在夏威夷眞珍灣的太平洋艦隊被我轟炸部隊攻擊而慘敗，和碇泊於母港中的英國戰艦王家·奧克號在開戰後被德國潛水艦撃沈等事，可爲例證。因此，在大東亞戰緒戰中先發制人的奇撃夏威夷大作戰的計劃，完全可稱是近代海戰理論的理想，英美所視爲萬難成功者，唯有訓練與技術並皆優秀的日本海軍，始克奏功。這也是一個實例。</p>
<p>可是飛機的行動，在許多地方尙被天候所左右，在這裏如其加上了，潛水艦之不斷威脅，對遠道進攻的敵方艦隊大爲不利，而邀撃方面則爲有利。因此，我方已占領了故在於太平洋上星棋羅佈的許多姍瑚島，利用牠當作不沈的航空母艦，這完全顯示了我方戰綫的優越性。美國從空中·海上·堅決地要想奪囘這些據點而反攻，其理由即在於此。</p>
<p>可是照羅斯福所說，從南方攻擊，一年收復一個日軍所占領的許多道。那麼，如要完全收復，尙須五十年的歲月。依此看來，大東亞戰的相貌，正可銳是航空基施的爭奪戰。因此，日軍在開戰之初即奪佔威克島·闢島·吉爾貝特羣島等地，以此爲基地，以爲對美攻撃的據領，更奪佔了戰爭資材豐富的荷蘭東印度羣島·菲列濱羣島·馬來半島等，印度洋方面的安達曼羣島亦被我方占領，此地如整備完成爲設備完全的海軍基地，則爲這一個大軍港和新加坡之爲英國的基地具有不同的意義。依此態勢，日本已獲得了不收的位置，即使說已奠完了建設大東亞共榮圈的基礎，亦非過言。</p>
<p>下面我們來看使以前海戰的狀態爲之一變的飛機和潛水艦的現况：</p>
<p>甲，航空戰開戰之初，美國大平洋艙隊被日本精銳的海軍航空部隊潰滅，英國以不沈戰艦威爾斯親王號爲主力的遠東艦隊，亦吿全軍覆沒，於是英美喪失了優秀的海上機動力和航空艦隊，因而香港被攻拔了，新加坡被奪取了，菲列濱被占領了，不過半年餘的時間，百年來的野心，完全從東西被驅逐出去了。形成大東亞戰爭現階段的洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>邱吉爾倉皇地飛赴華盛頓，與羅斯福着擬挽囘之策。結果，金末爾大將被罷免了，新空軍指揮官金氏兼任聯合艦隊司令長官並作戰部長要職，空軍關係士官更陸續撥　於要職。依此看來可推知美國是怎樣地重視空軍。</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報提出這軍備改編問題，論及今後「美國必須依照第一長距離轟炸機和長距離飛艇，第二航空母艦，第三巡洋艦驅逐艦的順序，進行建造，以變更編制。」這雖不能說就是首腦部的意志，但亦相距不遠了。美國中止建造五萬八干噸級戰艦，更中止建造二萬五千噸級重巡洋艦，及輕巡洋艦，商船等，都拿來改造航空母艦，即其明證。可知美國正在急都直迫，思奪　太平洋制空權。</p>
<p>美國這作戰方法的變更，實爲對日本航空部隊自開戰以來所獲的大鞍果，採用爲一種挽囘的方策。最近美國已開姑漸漸的認識日本的實力了。</p>
<p>他們覺悟自己的慘敗實在於自惚與驕慢，現在正拚命傾注於戰局的挽囘。</p>
<p>那麼，他們想用何種戰略，以支持顏勢呢？他們首先用最大速力强化空軍，奪囘太平洋上被日軍佔領的各戰略據點，並轟炸日軍佔領地區的居民，向國民發表轟炸日本的謀略宣傅。他面，並用潛水艦的「游擊」戰，想破壞大東亞海的通商。同時，他們又念遽地補充在阿留申羣島，所羅門羣島，珊瑚海，夏威夷等戰役中所喪失的主力艦隊，想建造和日本聯合艦隊相等的戰艦，以挽囘海上主力艦隊的頹勢。於是遂有尼密資「日本本土大空襲」的豪語，陸軍次官彼得生則在國民面前作朦混敗績的宣傳稱：「日本及日本人近來眞的渾身感到了戰爭的痛苦了」。組約泰晤士報也說：「空襲日本本土，先須奪囘緬甸，且强化在華美空軍，建立有組織的空襲計劃。」以煽動本國國民的敵愾心。但美國人民尚沒有從快樂的夢中覺醒過來，物資不足，被軍隊徵收，工資不富等引起了勞働糾紛，國內有很顯著的杌揑狀態。</p>
<p>現在未檢討美機的「誒本本土大空襲」。敵人正蹶越從事於空軍的增强以中途島，達寄哈巴爲基地，想轟炸日本本土。但他們一點也不知道，所羅門羣島的美兵，爲了日本海軍航空部隊的緣故，運輪已吿杜絕，將有第二　　　家克　敗。　　　日空軍猛烈矗炸的緣故加欽首相悲鴻說：「美國在　甚麼，一架飛機也不來，澳洲向日本降伏好嗎？」向美國懇求武器輪送，就使祇有一點點的援助也好。又因最近日軍航空不對的猛烈轟炸而泣訴說：「誒本使用新銳機了」。總括一句話，他們要想空襲日本本土是不可能的。因爲在此次的戰爭中，實施大空襲的距離都很近，以大編隊空襲離基地六〇〇喱以外的地方，尙無此先例。當然，飛機的發達，極爲迅速，今日的飛機，不能當作明日的飛機使用，可是從中途島，達奇哈巴到東京的距離約在二千三百喱以上，美國的某軍事評論家曾說：「對距離八百公里以上的地區實施連續空炸，頗爲困難，因距離的增大而减低炸彈的搭載量，在戰略上是不利的」。</p>
<p>加以日本本土的防衛，極爲周密，北方首先占領了熟田，鳴神島，在太平洋的重心佔領了威克島，南洋羣島，新幾尼亞也配布了堅强的防衛，不容敵人越雷池一步，而且澳洲也一天的將成爲太平洋的棄兒。</p>
<p>我們應將這大東亞共榮圈之一環的太平洋棄兒加以援手，收養爲寄子。</p>
<p>日本海軍占領鐵摩耳島後，以北澳洲的速爾文港，溫遠姆，蒲爾姆等爲中心，不絕地展開空中戰，自新不列顛，拉蒲爾等，又被日本佔領後，澳洲完全擊落爲「太平洋的孤兒」。美國最重視這南方對日進攻路綫，正在策劃着空軍的增强，與日本空軍演出猛烈的基地爭奪戰，因飛機在質量上日本均較美國佔得一步優勢，太平洋的制空襲在日本方面，故敵空軍並運輸艦隊常蒙重大損害，漬散於南太平洋的大海中</p>
<p>這南太平洋的大空戰，勇壯凄烈，無與倫比，後世的戰史家，將不加思索地冠以「誠爲激烈的空中戰」之言詞。</p>
<p>總之，美國正在拚命增强空軍。窺觀我南方占領基地。至於我方則亦占領南方的美國基地，隔斷美國，澳洲間的海上交通，使澳洲成爲「太平洋的孤兒」。</p>
<p>四月七日，大本營發表了佛羅烈達島洋面海戰。這是繼二月一日的伊柴貝拉島洋面海戰以來的壯烈的空中戰，以南太平洋爲舞台，展開以來，日美二軍在極近距離，短兵相接，嚴陣對峙，在佛羅烈這海戰中，日方自普那，瓜達爾卡納爾方面轉進後，有效地阻止了想在此方面補充兵方，武器，彈藥的敵大運輸船團，擊沈八千噸以上的大型軍輸船二艘，五千噸以上的八艘，此外並有巡洋艦，驅逐艦二艘。擊落護衛這運輸船團的格拉曼機P三十八型共計三十七架。</p>
<p>由此看來，可知美國想輸送十數萬的兵力和很多的飛機以奪囘戰路的據點。世界上無可比　的大空戰，以地區上極渺小的一孤島爲中心而展開着。但日本航空部隊常擊敗敵人，尤以佛羅烈達海戰一役，痛撃敵方的反攻企圖，更撃沈運輸船十三艘，此足以證明日本航空部隊之日趨强大，完勝態勢之日見强固。美國海軍部發表在本海戰中美國僅喪失飛機七架，敗戰的情况則含糊其詞，以欺瞞世界的耳目。縱令美國作豪語稱欲奪囘日軍占領地，縱令美國如何增派飛機，但在日本精銳航空隊之前，僅剩下了七零八落的殘骸。而佛羅烈達島洋面海戰的戰果尚新鮮地在我們的耳旁的時候，四月十二日大本營又發表了日本梅軍航空部隊戰鬥轟炸聯隊在四月十一日，十二日二日至間，功績新幾尼亞與洛潛的敵艦船，飛機羣，撃沈運輸船四艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊墜飛機六十架以上日方則損失飛機五架。</p>
<p>又最近二十三日在阿留申方面，也撃沈了巡洋艦，驅逐艦，日方航空部隊，佔得全面的優勢。</p>
<p>乙。通商破壞戰，其次，美國誇稱用潛水艦巡行「游擊戰」又如何呢？如其詳細在作戰上加以檢討，這潛水艦的「游撃戰」</p>
<p>轉入第六版</p>
<h3>大東亞精銳聯合艦隊</h3>
<p>「不如海的國家，永久不興」「將來的世界，中心在太平洋」此實至理名言。唯有知太平洋，握太平洋之國家，才是領導未來人類的國家。我東亞民族。有此龐大艦隊，不愁不控制太平洋，亞洲全民族必得成功。</p>
<h3>戰必勝攻必克日本海軍眞無敵　無敵艦隊的巨砲</h3>
<p>無數艦隊一度出動，英美敵國心胆俱裂，一枚巨彈可使世外歷史轉換。</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>自第五廠轉來</p>
<p>也　沒有成爲像美國所誇稱的那種反攻武器。潛水縣因其性質而不能有大的航續力，把潛水艦　身完全潛伏於海底亦不可能，不過全潛水艦的幾分之一可以潛伏。尤以美國的潛水艦，旣沒有充分的隻數。也沒有充分的技術，不是日本潛水艦的對手。</p>
<p>目前世界各處，　面通商破壞戰日見激化，　百五十年來以支配世界七大海洋誇稱的英首相邱吉爾，乘飛機或赴蘇聯，或飛美國，東奔西走，來去匆匆，哀求援手。出以面德國用潛水艦學沈的船舶數，凌駕英美二國造船量之上，另一面在太平洋上，日本潛水艦，正在羅斯福向國民掩飾敗續，囈譜勝利的時候，出現於加利福尼亞，常在美國沿岸擊沈武衣商船。五月二十三日又在阿留申方面大破美國戰艦巡洋艦，縱橫活躍，東西呼應，向擊沈海上艦艇而邁進。</p>
<p>這一　，和美國襲擊醫院船的非人道行爲，完全異趣。</p>
<p>然而關於這通商破壞戰的性格，近世的海戰史家，瑪亭提督述之如此：</p>
<p>「用通商破壞戰徹底的破壞敵方的通商時，可以把敵人迫迫於窮乏的深淵。所以這種作戰在將來的戰爭上担任非常重大的任務，但從海上作戰的觀點看來，不過是次要的作戰。如其把通商破壞戰推爲海上作戰的第一位，相信通商破壞戰就可以擊滅敵人，那是極大的錯覺。」</p>
<p>可是這並不是和海上作戰完全　別的，與海上勢力有　斷相輔的關係，對敵方海上兵力處於劣勢的塲合，這是唯一的方法；若在優勢的塲合，如併用這種作戰方法，當然可以更是異彩。</p>
<p>美國在戰前的倫敦會議中，從正義人道的立塲，曾倡議完全廢止潘水艦，且在前次大戰中，因德國的無限制擊沈商船，漢視人道，而對德宣戰，但現在已經屢次用潛水艦攻擊醫院船，這實是非文　違反國際公法的行爲。暴露了盎格魯撒克遜人的野蠻，擊襲醫院船的潛水艦長，他祗愚蠢地想自己建功，却反而激揚了日本前綫後方的國民的敵愾心，造成了相反的效果。他就使俯伏在高唱正義人道解放黑人的林肯銅像面前，亦不能免其罪，</p>
<p>敵人想以所謂ABCD的對日包圍陣綫來壓制日本，已被日本用精銳部隊驅逐於印度，阿留申，所羅門羣島的彼方，但我們決不以此自滿。</p>
<p>啊留申，中途島，所羅門以來的地區，依然在敵方的勢力範圍下，澳洲之四的東西民族，也尚在敵的榨取下，所以我們仍然有解放這些東亞民族的義務。敵人除策動南太平洋的戰鬥之外，更煽動蔣介石，利用他想奪囘緬甸，而不動用本國的兵力。</p>
<p>現在來看印度洋方面，日本海軍部隊自擊滅英國的印度洋艦隊以來，已有一年。他們正在逐漸從事强化戰略據點。非法地，不先通知而占領法國領士馬達加斯加哥羅麻，電羽尼翁等地。</p>
<p>世界有名的國際法學者，言在英國輦出，然而英國刻做出這種國際法上所不容的行爲，實　露出混雜的性格。英國縱令行使了國際法上所不許的不法行爲，但在日本的緬甸，安　曼，東　度諸島的鋼輪鐵幫般的陳勞前的英國也只有汲汲於退守印度洋印一途。</p>
<p>（四）日本的必勝態勢</p>
<p>上面說明了近代追戰中訓空·制海·制中三位一體的作戰是此次海戰的勝利之鍵，英美雖高唱對日反攻作戰，然日本在此三方面一步也不會失敗。戰爭是國家舉總力以戰，所以除了上面軍事的戰爭外，物的資源，人的資源，即三M（Mililary，Money，Men.）不待說，自是必要的因素。就人的資源而言，東亞共有十億，日本一億，這現狀毋庸再加贅述。至於物的資源，各國報紙都說今年—一九四三年是決戰年，如果這是眞的話，那麼日本的勝利早已沒有疑惑的餘地。但敵性新聞或通訊則用天文學的數字揭載或通報美國所誇示的造艦計劃和飛機戰車的生產額，自己把自己迷惑於五里霧中，說勝利是在英美方面。</p>
<p>可是這些人們完全沒有認淸日本海陸軍所收獲的偉大戰果，已使日本處於必勝不敗，銅牆鐵壁的位置。除非世界上產生了最大的奇蹟，美國海陸軍的精神力和術力才能達到勝過日本的狀態。因此，要想擊滅日本海軍，挽囘迄今日爲止日本所獲戰果，收復失地，使日本屈驟，終究是無須加以考慮的。茲試略述其理由</p>
<p>羅斯福達總統自加蘊勃則加命議歸國後，第一聲就說美國陸軍兵力要增强到七百五十萬。在今日，運輸一名兵士，至少必須十八噸的船腹，是以輸送十萬名陸軍，最少限度必須百八十萬噸的船腹。假定說一般船的平均噸數是一萬五千噸，那么輸送十萬名陸軍的運輸船就要百二十艘船雙。這運輸船隊在巡洋艦　驅逐艦保護之下，在中日本制空制海的海面進出，任何人都不以爲是可能的。蓋在那方面索敵警戒中的日本艦船，飛機，祇要一發電訊，待機中的日本艦隊就立刻可以將其擊沈，如此看來，美國陸軍即使怎樣增强了，其陸軍即使誇示有多麼龍大，實無須加以介意。</p>
<p>那末，我們祇須對美國的海軍作若干研究。羅斯福曾商得對日總反攻，從南方進攻路，北方進攻路漸次奪囘日本佔領基地，但此方面星棋羅佈的許多羣島，已被日本當作不沈的航空母艦用以窺何美國本土，所以美國就使要用龍大的航空母艦來攻擊，不沈的航空母艦將立即把可沈的航空母艦擊沈。至於說到想從太平洋的中心空龔日本本上，可是日本本土的各前衛島，却不是美國艦隊這樣容易接近的。故美國最想用作攻擊的進路，是北方的阿留申和南方的所羅門方面。不選擇航海上最困難的中央進攻路。退一步說，我們來看極度有利於美國方面的觀測，他們所企圖的反攻，不像渝軍那樣　止於宣傳，假定他們的計劃成功，在二年三年之後，捲土重來，曾連日本的佔領地區，在那塲合，德國名戰略家毛奇將軍的話及一代騙子之拿破崙的話，已明白地給與解決了。</p>
<p>毛奇將軍說：</p>
<p>「戰力猶如河道。近水源的地方常是很强力的，無論有多少的兵力，作用於遠距離的塲合，其壓力漸减。忘却了這事實而作戰，實是愚者的戰略。」</p>
<p>戰術王拿破崙說：</p>
<p>「戰方利距離成反比例，同等的兵力，一距離的長短而戰時，近者有利。」</p>
<p>這二位戰略戰術大家的言論，是戰爭上的公理，祇要日本海軍健在着，英美無論如何努力，要收復失地，且使日本屈服，終爲夢想。</p>
<p>今試以台灣南端的鵝鑾鼻岬爲中心，畫一個直徑四千公里的圓圈來看：這大圓弧的軌跡西自安達曼羣島經緬甸全境，南自大巽他小巽他懂印度羣島經鐵慶耳島過新幾尼呀的一周，東至夏威夷島，其中部包含着菲列濱，馬來，這大圓弧中的地方，日本海軍的武力，正在着着進行建設。</p>
<p>在近代戰中要做一個勝利者，其先決問題首先必須獲得戰爭資材中的最重要部門鐵，油，鍋，橡膠，鎢等生活必需品的米，砂糟等是絕對必要的。這些東西，那在這圓弧內的土地上，是世界的寶庫，所藕　的數量最多。所以英美喪失了這寶庫後，戰爭資源愈加缺乏，都已到了日本的手中，今日這大東亞戰爭將來即使綿　數十年，也不致因物資不足而失敗。</p>
<p>曾稱爲世界第一的產業國資源國之美國，也因從這些士地中獲得資源而成爲世界第一，英國也以此而得保持世界的海軍。他們喪失了這些地方一年之後，英國已感到物資的不足，美國也因鎢，橡膠，砂糖等的缺乏的緣故，軍需品製造不足的狀態極爲深刻。加以勞倫者的怠工，羅斯福以下的白宮大官們，正在考慮對筆，派研究日本歸來的格魯和其他許多人集議解決勞動糾紛，說「日本是强國，國民不要低佔日本的實力」故今後物的資源之缺乏的結果將不能成爲反軸心國家羣的兵工廠，不滿不供給武器的援助。美國現在提供若干舊式武器給困乏重慶和澳洲，以保存美國的感嚴，不使他們從聯合戰綫中脫退。以前「有」的國家，轉變爲「無」的國家，因此，英美二國當然極度恐懼東亞共繁圈的建設，對其將來誠不堪再寄予同情。而日本現在則已自給自足，高枕無憂了。</p>
<p>世界列强中沒有像日本這樣難攻易守的國家。所以德國宣傳部長戈培爾說「難攻不落的日本」，實是適當的言詞。</p>
<p>（五）嗚呼，山本元帥！</p>
<p>我們，不，全世界人士均遭遇了一極大變故而爲之悲傷，經過一天二天之後，這驚詫變成爲讚歎之聲，這悲傷變成爲感激，這世紀的大事就是山本元帥的戰死。日本一億國民的信仰希望集於一　。「海軍中有山本，則邦家安如泰山」。可是山本大將却忽然走上了黃泉之旅途了。</p>
<p>囘　自任聯合艦隊司令長官三年以來，大東亞戰爭中所獲的赫赫大戰果，完全出於山本大將的運籌帷幄。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭中海的聖將東鄕元帥，以八十八歲全共天年而成神。世界上任何人士知道他的死訊而表哀悼之意。</p>
<p>我們現在又損失了第二聖將，日本國民的哀悼此東鄕元帥更甚。世界人士亦毫不躊躇地對武將而又爲飛行隊的創設者的元帥之死難於飛機同致讚美之辭。但一旦以武將而活躍於戰塲，戰死的覺悟毋　說是當然的。以武將而死於戰塲，正是最上的名譽。</p>
<p>山本元帥之死，給與日本國民以極大的悲哀，元帥之死，對海軍戰力毫無影響，山本以前，或許沒有像山本元帥那樣的名將，但山本元帥之後，有無數的山本元帥存在着。</p>
<p>因此，山本元帥的戰死，昂揚了一億國民及聯合艦隊的將士之無限敵愾心。振作了無限的士氣。</p>
<p>老幼男女，皆繼山木元帥之後，結成一億，不　十億的總力，以迄於獲得不能不勝的勝利之日爲止。（翔譯）</p>

<p>（六）大東亞戰爭中日英美海軍力之現狀及將來</p>
<p>主席（伍）：在友邦第三十八屆海軍紀念期中，本社舉行這個中日合作海軍「座談會」，意義是相當重大的。我們囘溯當日，俄戰爭之際，日本海軍一舉而殲滅帝俄之和波羅的艦隊，摧毀了帝俄侵略東亞的東方艦隊實力，粉碎了帝俄覬覦東亞的野心這一戰爭，是友邦日本負起保衛東亞責任的起點，在保衛東亞史上佔了最光榮的一頁，所以日本海軍紀念日，不僅爲友邦的光榮，我們站在東亞民族的立塲也同樣感到興奮和愉快，日俄戰爭以後，友邦日本海軍日夕訓練研究，不斷求量數上的强化，質素上的優越，精神上的淬勵，故當大東亞戰爭爆發之日，即給予美太平洋前哨夏威夷珍珠灣海軍根據地以莫大的損害。開戰數日後，更將英東亞艦隊主力艦威爾斯王子號等兩艘予以擊沉，繼之在極短促的期間內，相繼佔領英美侵略東亞的根據地，確立大東亞共榮圈之基礎，其後再經數度所羅門羣島海戰，更將英美反攻東亞的海軍勢力消滅了大半，從而奠定了東亞戰爭最后勝利的基礎，中國海軍在遜淸未葉即開始建設，　在不平等條約，縛束下藩籬盡　，終無海防可言，逮國府還都以後，我們爲負起興復中華保衛東亞的使命，對於新中國海軍之建設。即從訓練人的基本工作做起，收獲預期之進步，在此英美侵略勞力驅出於東亞之際，建設新中國海軍，應就現置上盡其成大之努力，然在按術上有賴於友邦之協助者正多，而保衛東亞又爲中日共同之使命，本社因在保衛東亞具有深長意義之舉辦此座談會，希望各位就上述所擬幾個問題，儘量發表宏論，現在我想先請鎌田先生就「日俄戰爭海戰對保衛東亞之意義」對表高論</p>
<p>鎌田：世界各國的盛衰，大都要著所有海軍勢力的大小而定。記　在三十多年前，當時美國的總統也叫羅斯福，他說：「美國的是否能强大，要看美國是否能控制太平洋。」這可見他們的野心和早已感到海軍的重要。。英國在世界各牠都有殖民地，他對歐洲各國極力平衡各國勢力，使自己能操縱各國永久維持擴展殖民地的機會，尤其對東方的野心，更爲濃厚。將印度作殖民地。又以香港作對東方再進一步的侵略根據地。其他如德意法蘇聯等，也很注意太平洋，尤其蘇聯的遠東政策，在帝俄時代，即已開始，因他的西方有德法等的關係不能擴展，所以帝俄一向在東方進攻與滿淸政府訂立秘密條約，甚且向日本的後方千島　太等地，也派軍去謀擴展勢力，各國也同時向東方開始進攻，都要求中國開故門戶，但是我們要想美國總統曾說：「美國是美國人的美國那末我們也應說：「亞洲是亞洲人的亞洲」才對，但是當時的亞洲仍未覺悟歐美的侵略，他們反認爲歐美是幫忙，認歐美是先進國，以爲無法抵抗，而自暴自棄，鑄成大錯，忍受歐美的侵略，人類原是陸地上的，對水的關係較淺，但是日本的國土，四而環海，故對水的關係很深，而且地方又　，同時爲了各國野心勃勃，所以早就覺悟到各國的侵略，在幕府時代，已實有「殖國政策，」不與外國往來，致使明治時代，日本的國民對各國不很明瞭。明冶天皇說「日本要吸收列强的文化，」但此，日本一方面包吃日本精神，一方面又吸收列强的文化智識，開始建設日本海軍。日本海軍在明治五年（一八七二年）距現在七十一年的時候，即開始成立，於中日一戰，得遠東半島，當初英美各國都爲自己利益　　，要日本交還中國。日本因無力對付各國，而即交還，但是俄國於日本交還後，不久却向滿淸政府借旅順大連，日本受此刺激，即極力建設海軍，以明治大皇極注意海軍的擴張，並將公務人員一律半薪，以半薪作「海軍建設金，」人民也鑾應擁護。日本在日俄戰爭時，共右戰鬥艦六只，裝中巡洋艦十八雙，驅逐艦十九隻，水雷艇七十六隻，共爲二六四六八四噸，而在中日戰爭時，僅二六二七四噸，於十年中大有進步，日俄戰爭的展開，是在明治卅七年二月，俄國在遠東半烏强化軍力，日本交涉，他們軍隊撤退，自明治三十六年八月，日本進行由外交方法，希　和平解決，但是俄方非但沒有囘答，並且軍隊反而推進，因而這種「日俄談判。」曾經過六個月之久，而湲有結果。戰事開始後，俄國海軍曾企圖將日本在滿之海陸軍切斷，調「波羅的海艦隊」東來，該艦隊擁有戰艦八艘，巡洋艦九隻，海防艦三隻，驅逐艦九隻，向日本進攻，日本在　　五月二十七日，即現在舉行的神聖的海軍紀念日，把俄艦隊完全擊滅。當時世界各國輿論遂均認日本能擊敗俄國。申報社論且對日擊敗俄國表示欣慰。後來印度也認識亞洲人若能奮起，便可抵抗歐美的侵略，途引起印度的反英美運動，所以日說海戰是「亞洲黎明時代」的開始，可惜當時日本未曾與亞洲人携手，以對付歐美，我想亞洲人總有一天能携手起來，驅逐英美達到「亞洲是亞洲人之亞洲」的一大。</p>
<p>主席：現請姜西問校長講述「中日海軍合作問題」。</p>
<p>姜：中日海軍合作，自國府還都以來，已有三年了。事實上我國新海軍非常幼稚，與强大的日海軍合作，非常抱愧，但是我們已在力求進取中。新海軍現在已開始創造，惟物資尚缺乏，而製造很少，但新海軍新精神已與日軍合作，祇要精神上有意志的合作，新海軍當有改造的可能。並且必定要赴全力量合作，不要以「心有餘而力不足」自歉。建造新海軍中的唯一重心，就是要有確定的合作，同時在合作中要互相瞭解中國海軍的缺點，就是軍人有不得意的苦衷，無騐是社會是家庭，他們都有痛苦在衷頭，應加以暸解。屆時中國新海軍與友邦海軍的友誼，要有誠意，不要因習慣等種種不同而不瞭解，要知道有了誠意的合作就能達到圓滿的目的。</p>
<p>中國一般人「大陸觀念」很深，而「海祥觀念」很淺，但在中日合作的今日，海軍的合作比較，任何合作更有希望，還望友邦來幫忙，使沒有海軍觀念的中國國民，也對海洋發土興趣。瞭解海軍的重要性。並且無論精神上物質上要求澈底合作，在大東亞共榮圈中，海軍的合作最爲重要，所以現在海軍的合作，是大東亞整個問題。中國民族精神過去已有很多民族英雄，如友邦也已有許多偉蹟，同出一轍，這一次大東亞戰爭，是中日兩國合作精神的發達，但中國海軍因環境而不易發揚，還有賴友邦指導的、自己也自當努力奮鬥。在三十八年來日俄戰爭後，友邦海軍無日不在積極準備中，所以海洋是東亞人的山本大將的殉國，可代表東亞精神我國得悉消息後，非常哀悼，尤其兩國海軍已得到敎訓，對中日兩國合作，前途更有偉大的光明，更可表揚兩國合作的精紳，至於習慣可以相互改進的中國海軍已有新的生命，我們已有妤的環境有堅强的意志，若努力發揮與友邦合作相信前途是光明燦爛的。</p>
<p>主席：現在請葉可松局長發表「建設新中國海軍與保衛東亞」的宏論。</p>
<p>葉：「一個民族先要有「中心思想」纔得萬衆一心，向「中心思想」前進，達到成功建設。新中國海軍的「中心思想」，就是汪主席指示下之「復興中國保衛東亞。」在大東亞戰爭以來，友邦已把英美百年以來在東亞的勢力完全驅逐出去，在這時期中，政府也已毅然回英美宣戰，我新海軍也應與日海軍「駢肩作戰。」但實因新海軍的建設尙在萌芽時期，還不能與日軍駢肩作戰。所以我國先要有建設新海軍的精神。以這精神而推進一而把現有的力量，確保治安，强化國府威力，使民衆對新海軍要有認識信仰，而熱烈擁護，纔能使新海軍强大，担任一部大東亞戰爭的責任。</p>
<p>主席：現在請認寶璜艦長指示「如何建設新中國海軍」的意見。</p>
<p>湯：建設新中國海軍得不容易，但是無論那一個國家，要有强大的海軍，纔得國勢强大，但建設海軍第一須要精神，第二就是金餞。唯除此二個要點以外，還要有人才　也是唯一的先決條件。有了金錢，纔能大量製造兵艦，製造兵艦，就須先設工廠，月前中國海軍的建設種種很感到困難、不要說幾千幾萬噸，就是幾百噸的兵艦、也不容易但　們知須奮鬥努力建設，由小廠而至大廠，逐漸求進步，更須要使民衆認識當前海軍建設的重要，都加以重視，全國一體努力建設，纔能使新中國海軍强大，與友邦合作，保衛東亞。</p>
<p>主席：現在再請鎌田報道部長發表「中日海軍合作」的意見。</p>
<p>鎌田：貴國人常有一種表示說：「中國是地大物博，並且人也多，軍人很多，日本方面海軍世界有名，祗要中國負責陸軍，日本負責海軍，已足夠合作保衛東亞」。而日本人却認爲海洋很重要，最好使中國人不知道海洋的重要，不希望中國海軍擴大，因爲擴大對日本有相當影響，這是一部份日本人的思想，這種思想，好似各有道理，但實則很誤會。要知到打開地圖看，大東亞惟有兩國合作，纔能保術東亞，獲得勝利，同時中國人認爲的分工合作。也絕對沒有理由，可將事實在考證。英國對殖民地也這樣，譬如在印度，祇准種植棉，緬甸稱米等不許在同一地方出產多樣物資，這種分工合作，是英國殖民地的政策，中日合作決使不得。不過話也要說囘來，英國的殖民政策在和平時是對的，一旦發生事故，也就有問題，　印緬希獨立時，英國的米也就成問題了。中日海軍合作，則希望中國須要有强大的海軍，甚且陸空軍與日合作，這是日本的精神，但是海軍的建設，須要有相當時期，日本已有七十一年的歷史，在官民合作下假設，所以我希望中國祗要官民合作，努力建設，振起建設新海軍的精神，努力前進，纔能獲得成功。</p>
<p>主席：現在再讀姜校長發表「新中國海軍建設的現狀」。</p>
<p>姜：現在海軍建設的要點就是先須培植人才，担任這個義務的是中央海軍學校，已有五千學生，其中已經畢業的有二千之數，尚有三千正在校訓練中。本校除了敎育學生外，還有高級軍士訓練班。現已到第三期了，把中國所有海軍集合敎育。關於水兵的敎青，現在有三個水兵訓練所，第一所在上海，第二所在廣州，第三所在威海衛。水兵訓練所辦理練習敎育。關於高等敎育，仍須有上海中央海軍學校。以上是關於海軍培植的大槪情形，至於海軍要防司令部，第一就在首都南京，自還都以來，已成立三年，第二在廣州，就是過去的廣東江防司令部，現已改名爲廣州要防司令部，第三在威海衛，也名威海衛要防司令部。同時正要成立的，是漢口海軍基地部隊，也是要防司令部的雛形，都有相當砲艦等設備，有的出口，有的在內地担任要防任務。基地部担任警備工作，還有水路測量局担任今國水路測量任務，於葉局長司令歡衛以來，極得相當成績，國防海軍的規模已基定，內部機構已有系統，在海軍部統一指揮之下，與友邦海軍合作及精神上的建設，都在一天一天進步，中就是各項物資已由友邦逐漸　渡，而且趨充裕了。</p>
<p>主席：現在請鎌田部長發表「大東亞戰爭中日英美海軍勞力的現狀及將來」。</p>
<p>鎌田：自從大東亞戰爭把英美勢力全部驅逐出東亞，他們預定的目的，已全部被打破，在大東亞戰爭前英美方面保特「五五三」的勢力，在發生戰時當初，美海軍勢力爲主力艦十七只，航空母艦六只，巡洋艦三十七只，驅逐艦一百六十六只，潛水艇一〇八只，但美國渡過太平洋上的勢力，還認爲不夠，須加上一倍的力量方可達到目的。所以對各項軍艦等，尚在極力製造中。英國方面，爲主力艦十五只，航空母艦八只，巡洋艦七十只，驅逐艦二百零六只，潛水艇四十三只，美國除擁有商項勞力外，還在建造中，倘不與德國交戰，及大東亞戰爭的話，在今年三月計，預算可稱世界第一海軍國。關於日本勢力本來可相合，但是因在戰爭中，所以對軍艦等隻數不得報告，還請原諒。在九年前，倫敦海縮會議席上，山本大將提案取消海軍軍縮條約，其後，不幸發生中日事變，繼而同英美戰爭，但日本還在很努力建設軍艦，不過數字也不能相告。日本曾舉行懸奬，徵求海軍標語，結果第一名的標語「爲五五三，日日金」這意思是五五三是英美估計與日本的努力比率，合日金爲日本海軍人員的工作，僅星期一至五·六日兩日休息，但海軍人員應天天在星期一至五的過程中，奮鬥建設，寓意極深，換句話說，是拿出日本的精神去奮鬥，日本訓練壯丁的精神，也是這樣，日本注意於「五五三」的比率，始終要打倒不平均的勢力，所以這次大東亞戰爭，就給敵人一個絕大打擊，這時日本向採用的方策於敵方勢力平勻後，再與極力戰爭。在大東亞戰爭開始即給予敵人絕大打擊，現在已將五五三的勢力顛倒了，如威爾斯親王等的擊沉可爲鐵證，英美的海軍勢力已比不上日本海軍的努力了。但是現在飛機非常發展，海軍重於軍艦，但是現在對飛機也要考慮到，有的從根據地起飛，但大都從航空母艦起飛，所以航空母艦很重要，在大東亞戰爭前，英國有六個差不多已經消滅，雖然他們還大事宣傳，但是推測起來，如非將別艦改造或製造以前所有的都已全無了。但是英國被德意打沉的軍艦不少，受損很多，幷且上空飛機猛炸，各工廠影想者非淺，那是無庸考慮的。所以建設上已受偌大打擊了，美國對各種軍艦等，尚在建造中，不過我們不能輕視敵國，因輕視對方，容易失敗，但是他們宣傳的數目不能置信，因製造非易，且於戰後之損失，絕對不能補全。美國努力生產。要反攻是絕難的。講到將來，英國與美國的勞力的相差很大，美國必佔優勢，故英國的前途吾人認爲很可憐。美國在報上宣傳生產很多軍火，但物資上的存業已吿罄，雖然他們工廠不分盡夜竭力生產，但能力已弱，他們勞力的能力很弱，在工廠方面受傷或死亡的人數比率，據統計要比戰場上多四十倍之多，所以巳呈退步的現象，日本實際上前因物資缺乏，現已在南方得到很豐富的物資，已在開發物資工作，所以從今後祗有發展而無退步，可得必勝的地位丁。最後關於山本大將陣亡的事情，有一般人認爲大將的死或有大不利，但海軍與陸軍不同的，海軍的指揮元帥在旗艦士領導，且站在最高的司令台上，指揮作戰，由本大將的殉國是在機上作戰或視察而不幸殉國，我人很爲哀悼，但軍人益加奮鬥，仍繼承大將意志，完成大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>主席：承蒙各位先後發揮很寶貴意見提供很有價值的材料，本座會生色不少領教之下衷心至爲感謝，最后請楊迥浪先生綜合各方意日作一結論。</p>
<p>楊：中日海軍合作問題，在大東亞戰爭中是值得　論的，日本是遠東強有力的國家，在明治維新以來，已成爲世界海軍強國。在百年之前，東亞有很大的危機：（一）英國的海軍勢力侵佔亞洲，（二）美國海軍勢力伸入太平洋，（三）如果的海軍包圍到滿州一帶，。日本維新以後，日俄戰爭的結果把俄國打敗了。所以日俄戰爭，就是保衛大東亞戰爭的起點，但很要澈底保衛東亞，必要建設新中國海軍，自國府麥戰後對海軍的建設，已日有進展。如上海廣州，威海衛，南京，以至漢口，都有海軍軍官水兵的訓練，及要港司令部的設置。雖然建設強有力的海軍不是容易的事情，但是（一）因友邦日本誠意協助中國完成海軍的建設，（二）中國地大物博人衆，建陸軍固然重要。建海軍也需要的，只要有建設海軍毅力和勇氣，前途是有希望的。說道大東亞戰爭中，日英美海軍勢力的比對。在海縮會議之前，日本海軍的建造爲日英美五五三比率所包圍，但自日本退出海縮會議直至大東亞戰爭之後，日本已把英美海軍撲滅，現在日英美海軍實力的對比，已變爲五五七的比率了，這便是日本海軍的光榮，也是大東亞的光榮，至於中日海軍合作，必須中國海軍建設起來，強大起來，才夠得　做日本海軍的朋友，才能負得起復興中華保衛東亞之使命。</p>

<h3>The Greater East Asia War and the Japanese Navy - Celebrating the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day</h3>
<p>From the perspective of historians, the Greater East Asia War should be seen as a development of the Russo-Japanese War of thirty-eight years ago. Thirty-eight years ago, the new Japanese navy created achievements that changed the history of East Asia; thirty-eight years later, the Japanese navy is creating a cause that is changing the history of East Asia and even the world.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight years ago, the situation in East Asia was in a very dangerous position. At that time, the devilish hand of British aggression was deeply penetrating the Chinese mainland, while the declining Tsarist Russia, in order to eliminate the growing revolutionary forces at home, to maintain its precarious autocratic rule, and to plunder land from the East to seize colonial hegemony, was constantly preparing to provoke foreign wars. Japan, which had not long after the Meiji Restoration, and whose national strength was not understood by foreign countries, happened to become the target of Tsarist Russian aggression. If Tsarist Russia had won against Japan thirty-eight years ago, then the Russian revolution would not have succeeded, and it would certainly be doubtful whether there would be a Soviet Union in the world. Moreover, the timing, nature, and location of the First World War twenty-eight years ago would have been very different from what actually happened. At that time, Britain and Russia might have first staged the tragedy of dividing China. Fortunately, the emerging Japan defeated the main force of Tsarist Russia in one fell swoop, shaken the foundation of Tsarist Russia's autocratic regime, consolidated the then Anglo-Japanese alliance, created a balance of power in East Asia, and delayed the outbreak of the First World War. More importantly, it laid the foundation for Japan to become a stabilizing force in East Asia and laid the foundation for Japan to become a defender of the Pacific.</p>
<p>The situation on the eve of the Greater East Asia War was almost the same as that of the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago. The declining Britain and the United States, which attempted to seize hegemony in the Pacific, like Tsarist Russia thirty-eight years ago, brewed the crisis of the East Asia War, used the contradictions between the East Asian nations, and implemented their "using Asians to control Asians" strategy, creating various conditions that would lead East Asians to extinction. If the British and American conspiracy had succeeded, the situation in East Asia and even the Pacific would naturally not know "where it would end." Fortunately, Japan inherited the traditional spirit of the Russo-Japanese War, especially the Japanese navy, who stood up on the vast Pacific Ocean and attacked the enemy everywhere from the sea and from the air. In a very short time, they forced the enemy to withdraw from every island and escape from the Pacific, returning the oceans and islands of Asia to the hands of Asians. The fighting spirit they displayed was the promotion and expansion of the fighting spirit in the Russo-Japanese War, shining on the Pacific and the whole world.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Japanese Navy Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters compiled the book "The Greater East Asia War and the Japanese Navy," which further promoted the faithful record of the great achievements of the Japanese Navy inheriting the glory of the Russo-Japanese War. It vividly wrote out the enthusiasm and loyalty of the Japanese patriots during the Russo-Japanese War reviving in the chests of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War. It simply and realistically depicted how the Japanese Navy stood up to fight in the Greater East Asia War and how they won victory. This book realistically depicts the amazing scenes of modern naval battles such as the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of the Malay Sea, the Battle of Wake Island, the Battle of the Naval Parachute Unit, submarine warfare, the Battle of the Java Sea, the Battle of Australia and the Indian Ocean, etc. This not only portrays the heroic and invincible posture of the Japanese Navy, but also provides East Asian nations with a wealth of new knowledge, providing practical knowledge of the role, strategy, tactics, new weapons, new technologies, etc. of the modern navy. At this time when China urgently needs to prepare for national defense and build a navy, we have translated and published this book into Chinese, which seems to be the most timely and precious gift for our army and navy personnel and the general patriotic people. At the same time, we dare to believe that the publication of the Chinese translation of this book is also the most appropriate and sincere commemoration of the 38th Japanese Navy Day.</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese War - Records of This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpts (7)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that it will be entirely the responsibility of Asians to protect the Pacific in the future, and that the British and Americans must no longer be allowed to exert aggressive forces. However, fulfilling the task of protection depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous advancement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its initial brilliance by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has further unleashed its invincible power. At present, the friendly navy alone bears the heavy responsibility for the entire defense of the Pacific, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden even slightly. Therefore, how we should emulate the friendly navy to establish the Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific in the future is truly the common goal that the people of our country should urgently aspire to and pursue. In order to increase the people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper has excerpted the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago as new excerpts, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Imperial Edict to the People (From this newspaper, No. 11400, Guangxu Year 30, December 4th, corresponding to January 9th, 1905, Monday)</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo reported: On the first day of the first month of Meiji Year 38, the Emperor went to court and issued an imperial edict, saying: The Emperor of Great Japan, who is blessed by Heaven, whose imperial domain is consolidated and inherited for ten thousand generations, now swears to you, my loyal and brave subjects. I am now at war with the Russians. My army and navy should each exert their loyalty and courage, and share the same hatred against the enemy. My officials and all civil servants should each diligently perform their duties to protect my country, strictly abide by the founding charter, and do their best. Do not let anything be wasted, and I have high hopes for you. What I hope for is the prosperity of the nation, the civilization, the peace of the people's hearts, and the friendship with all countries, which will be more sincere than before, so as to maintain the peace of the Eastern situation for a long time. May the prestige and rights not be damaged, and may all be of one mind, to establish the foundation for the future. I have always regarded diplomacy as the most important task, and I think about it day and night, and I dare not violate it. My officials can all deeply understand my intentions, harmonize with friendly countries, and increase their intimacy. Unfortunately, the Russians have acted recklessly, and I have had no choice but to raise an army to attack the violent. However, is this my original intention? What my empire values most is the preservation of the Korean territory, and I have never forgotten this idea for a day. Because Korea and Japan have been close for generations, and the survival of Korea is really related to my empire. The Russians have clearly made alliances with the Qing Dynasty and other countries, which is obvious. However, they occupied Manchuria. Once they had a place to breathe, they indulged in the ambition of annexation. In the future, if the land of Manchuria is incorporated into the Russian territory, how can Korea support Asia and maintain a peaceful situation? Therefore, I took this opportunity to discuss with the Russians, hoping to maintain peace for a long time and preserve the peace. I repeatedly ordered the officials to hold meetings with the Russians, and negotiated for more than half a year. The Russians outwardly wanted to make peace, but secretly prepared their armaments. The army and navy competed for power. At that time, I still thought of yielding to them, but the Russians were always indecisive and had no sincerity at all. I saw that Korea was facing imminent danger and was about to infringe on the rights and interests of the empire. Therefore, I launched a punitive expedition and met with them in armor. However, my original intention is still to hope to ensure that the country is strong and peaceful. How can I like war? I now tell you, my subjects, that you should each exert your loyalty and courage, work hard and join the army, to increase the glory of the empire, and to achieve boundless achievements, which is what I deeply rely on.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Japanese Welcoming the Masters (From this newspaper, No. 11397, Guangxu Year 30, December 1st, corresponding to January 6th, 1905, Friday)</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo reported: Our Japanese Navy Admiral Togo Heihachiro and Navy Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo returned triumphantly from Lushun. It was pre-arranged that they would arrive at Shinbashi Railway Station at 9:30 am on December 30th, Meiji 37th. Earlier, the Japanese people who admired the prestige of the two admirals rushed to Shinbashi to pay their respects. Outside the railway station, Asahi Kōki emblems and national flags of various countries were hung all around, colorful and numbering in the thousands. Members of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce, city councilors, ward councilors, and personnel from the Chamber of Commerce gathered in groups to watch, numbering no less than tens of thousands. Before long, the sound of wheels rumbled, arriving in front of the station. Mr. Togo, accompanied by Chief of Staff Mr. Shimamura, Staff Officer Mr. Akiyama, and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Nagata, alighted from the train in military uniform. Those who traveled with Mr. Kamimura included Chief of Staff Mr. Kato and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Ogoe. Following them were Imperial Envoy Mr. Inoue, Imperial Messenger Mr. Takeshima, and Empress's Chamberlain Mr. Yamauchi, Prince Higashifushimi, and Prince Fushimi Wakamiya, the two collateral princes, and Imperial Messengers from various princes, shaking hands warmly and expressing their respect. Then, Speaker of the House of Peers Mr. Tokugawa and Speaker of the House of Representatives Mr. Matsuda greeted each other. Chief of the General Staff Mr. Yamagata, Count Matsukata, Prime Minister Katsura, Minister of the Imperial Household Mr. Tanaka, Minister of the Navy Mr. Yamamoto, and various army and navy generals and officers, Governor of Tokyo Prefecture Mr. Chika, Mayor of Tokyo Mr. Ozaki, and thousands of other dignitaries from all walks of life welcomed them on the roadside. Admirals Togo and Kamimura then rode in carriages dispatched by the Imperial Household Ministry, heading directly to the Ministry of the Navy. Along the way, cries of "Banzai" were so loud that they seemed to echo like spring thunder from all sides. Everywhere they passed, every household hung the national flag. At Hibiya Park, hundreds of fireworks were set off. Outside the main gate of the Ministry of the Navy, the National Supporters Association erected a decorated arch to express their welcome. After the two admirals arrived at the Ministry of the Navy, the Imperial Palace dispatched Attendant Military Officer Mr. Inoue, and the General Headquarters sent Major General Mr. Murata and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Horiuchi to greet them. The two admirals met with Navy Minister Yamamoto in the minister's office according to etiquette, respectfully holding up a glass of champagne and shouting "Long live the Emperor! Long live the army and navy!" three times. When it was past 11:15, the two admirals rode in the Imperial carriage to enter the palace and be received in audience by the Emperor and Empress. Prince Arisugawa's chamberlain, Mr. Tokudaiji, secretary Mr. Iwakura, and attendant military officer Mr. Nagasawa were all in attendance. Navy Minister Yamamoto, Chief of the Naval General Staff Ito, and naval officers were divided into ranks and stood in attendance. The Emperor's voice was slow and gentle, expressing his appreciation. The two admirals then reported in detail the situation of the naval battles before and after the siege of Lushun. After the audience, the Emperor issued an edict, granting the two admirals and the Navy Minister, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, and others lunch. It was not until 2:20 pm that they left. Shortly after, the Emperor sent people to present each of the two admirals with a gold watch and a gift of wine and dishes. The officials below Mr. Shimamura were each given a gift of wine and dishes. Then, another table of delicacies and a jar of sake were sent to Mr. Togo's residence. That evening, the citizens of Tokyo planned to hold a large welcome party. Upon hearing this, Mr. Togo quickly wrote a letter of refusal, saying: "I am deeply grateful for your kindness. However, I am concerned that my subordinates are still exerting their strength on the battlefield, enduring the hardships of snow and wind. How can I alone bear such honors? My return to Tokyo is actually to obey the call of the General Headquarters to secretly plan important military affairs. I will soon have to go on an expedition again. I respectfully thank you, gentlemen, and urge you not to impose excessive honors and aggravate my faults." Therefore, the welcome party was cancelled.</p>
<h3>On the Strength of Japan (From this newspaper, No. 11371, Guangxu Year 30, November 5th, corresponding to December 11th, 1904, Sunday)</h3>
<p>Japan is an island nation in the Eastern Sea. In terms of its territory, it is no more than 360 square miles wide and no more than 7,500 miles long, with an area of no more than 16 million square miles. Its territory can be said to be narrow. In terms of its people, the entire country has no more than 45.7 million people. In the densely populated areas of the home islands, there are 6,000 people per square mile. In the northeast, the population is gradually sparser. In Hokkaido, there are only 90 people per square mile. Its people can be said to be sparse. Before the Meiji era, the shogunate seized power, the lords guarded their domains, and foreign troubles pressed daily. It was deceived by strong neighbors, and the national power gradually declined, as precarious as a pile of eggs. The people were worried and forced to change their plans. They studied in Europe and America, studied their laws, and were of one mind from top to bottom, so they changed the old ways. The political system became constitutional, education flourished, military affairs became sophisticated, commerce expanded, products became richer, and crafts became better. For thirty years, they have been pursuing practical studies, working diligently, and feeling that there is not enough time in the day. The country has gradually become strong and can rival the major powers of Europe and America. Last year, because of the affairs of Korea and the affairs of the three eastern provinces of China, they started a war with the strong Russia, and exchanged jade and silk for weapons. At that time, all countries around the world were worried about Japan, worried about the size of Russia and the smallness of Japan, worried about the strength of Russia and the weakness of Japan. Once they went to war, the outcome could be predicted without saying. But after fighting for almost a year, Japan was not only not defeated, but also won repeatedly. The Russian navy had almost its entire fleet destroyed. The army had almost all of its occupied territory taken away. Russia is a country of tigers and wolves, and all countries in Europe and America fear it. But Japan, a small country in East Asia, was able to capture flags and kill generals, defeating its army and navy. Why is it so strong? Observers have said that since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has become constitutional in its political system, flourished in its education, sophisticated in its military affairs, expanded in its commerce, richer in its products, and better in its crafts. Without this, it could not have achieved such great results. I believe that this is indeed the way for Japan to become a strong country, but its origin is not only this. Japan's strength lies in the fact that everyone shares the same feeling of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, without dispersion or taking advantage of chaos, sincerely facing each other, and of one heart and one mind. They regard their emperor and country as if their lives are connected. If they are separated, they cannot live in the world. The country also regards the people as if they share life and death. Therefore, the upper and lower levels are connected in one breath, firmly united and unbreakable, and there is nothing that cannot be done to revitalize all things. Reforming the old system is effective. My friend Mr. Zhang, who studied in Japan, recently sent a letter saying: "After Japan went to war with Russia, the national spirit was even more aroused. Men focus all their energy on military affairs and fulfill their duties as travelers. Women focus all their energy on education and fulfill their duties as residents. Millions of dollars in conscription funds are raised in an instant." The so-called conscription funds are donated in the name of providing winter supplies for the soldiers. There was an old woman who was very poor. Her husband died in the Sino-Japanese War. She used the compensation money to buy a thimble, which she always carried with her as an honor. Recently, when she heard about the donation of conscription funds, she offered the thimble, but the donation office said that she was too poor and said, "This is a gift from the emperor as a souvenir. How can I bear to accept it from you?" The old woman went home, cut off her finger with a knife, and returned to the donation office to give it, saying: "The finger has been cut off. What is the use of this? Take it." There was also a small child who was also very poor. He hated the Russians, but he was too poor to donate the conscription funds, so he sold cakes in the market and donated his income every day. These two things are recorded in the newspapers and spread in the neighborhoods. They are not unfounded rumors. From this, we can know that the Japanese people's heart of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country is firmly rooted and cannot be uprooted. This is why they can resist the Russians. Is it just the effect of striving for everything after the Restoration? Although Japan's strength originates from the people's loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, if it does not first engage in the political system, military affairs, education, commerce, products, and crafts, then there is no way to encourage their aspirations and arouse their spirits. Therefore, those who establish a country should still establish their foundations in the political system, education, military affairs, commerce, products, and crafts, and then they can inspire the people to generate their loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. If you only talk about loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, but do not first do your best in the political system, education, military affairs, commerce, products, and crafts, it will be impossible.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The glorious war results achieved by the Japanese naval forces in the South Pacific have been announced today, adding luster to the achievements of the Japanese army since the start of the war. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese navy attacked Hawaii first. Combining the subsequent naval battles such as the Battle of Malaya, the Japanese army achieved a total of 505 enemy ships destroyed, 484 vessels, and 4,826 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, creating an unprecedented record. Today, the navy has seized the initiative in combat, crushing the enemy's counterattacks and cutting off the US-Australia supply route. From May 5th to May 24th, a total of 13 enemy ships have been sunk in the waters there, totaling 111,400 tons. Among them, 2 15,000-ton oil tankers, totaling 30,000 tons, 6 cargo ships, totaling 57,000 tons, 1 11,000-ton, 3 10,000-ton, 1 8,000-ton, 1 7,000-ton and 1 other transport ship of 35,000-ton were sunk by submarines.

Moreover, the Japanese naval forces frequently attacked enemy submarines that appeared in the waters of the South Pacific and near the Japanese mainland. From April 1st to May 20th, a total of 17 enemy submarines were sunk, of which 7 were sunk by aircraft, and the other 10 were sunk by destroyers.</p>
<p>Manila, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A certain colonel of the Japanese Philippine Islands dispatched naval forces gave a radio speech here today titled "Welcoming Navy Memorial Day under the Greater East Asia War." The general idea was that Navy Memorial Day is a day to commemorate Japan's defeat of the invaders forty years ago and to lay the foundation for Japan's century. Britain and the United States want to dominate the Pacific and the world, while Japan advocates its natural rights within its own territory. Navy Memorial Day is a day that implies that Japan will resolutely defeat Britain and the United States. The mortal combat between Japan and Britain and the United States began after the Russo-Japanese War. Although the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, victory is already in our hands, and the rebirth of Greater East Asia will surely be realized soon.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Italian newspaper editor Geda, on the occasion of the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day, published an article today praising the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in this East Asian war. At this time, the Italian people across the country have a better understanding of the Japanese Navy's combat power against the British and American navies. Moreover, since the Japanese Navy can cope with the British and American navies with ease in the Pacific, the responsibilities of the German and Italian navies in the Atlantic and the Italian navy in the Mediterranean are naturally greatly reduced. In addition, since the Japanese Navy can smoothly and firmly grasp its power in the Indian Ocean, the raw materials needed for the most important bases and anti-Axis military industrial needs of Britain and the United States have been almost completely plundered. Geda continued that the most important condition for the final victory of the current war is to gain maritime hegemony and prevent Britain and the United States from crossing the sea to reach their front lines. Therefore, the Axis powers must annihilate the enemy's warships and transport ships one by one, and in this respect, the Japanese Navy should be given the primary credit. It was a great mistake for Britain and the United States to try to reduce the equipment of the Japanese Navy at the Washington Conference. They did not know that spiritual power is sometimes greater than material power. In this war, with the assistance of its air force, the Japanese Navy has shown great capabilities in night raids and landing operations. Former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Vice Admiral Yarnell, admitted that the Japanese Navy could not be defeated by the US military alone, and that is why.</p>
<h3>Allied Navy Memorial Day: National Government Scheduled to Celebrate</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The allied nation Japan destroyed the Imperial Russian Navy in the Sea of Japan on May 27th, 38 years ago, and achieved supreme war results. In order to commemorate this historically significant anniversary, the Japanese naval authorities specifically designated this day as Navy Memorial Day, which marks its 38th anniversary today. In order to commemorate this victory, the Japanese naval authorities stationed in Nanjing held a Navy Memorial Exhibition at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association starting on the 24th, and screened advertising slides and other publicity materials at various movie theaters. In order to celebrate the victory of the East Asian national navy, the Publicity Department of the National Government's Navy Department has also scheduled a celebration at the Dahua Grand Theater at 7:30 pm on the 29th, and will have a day off. Large banners and publicity materials will be hung at all major intersections, and Japanese residences will fly flags for one day to celebrate.</p>
<p>Naval Minister Ren's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - May 27th is the 38th Navy Memorial Day of the allied nation Japan. At this time, when the Japanese navy is soaring in the Pacific, threatening the Indian Ocean, and entering and exiting the Atlantic, the completion of the Greater East Asia Liberation War can be expected soon. The reconstruction of our navy also relies on the cooperation of the allied navy to lay the foundation. On this auspicious festival, the government and people of the allied nation unanimously celebrate enthusiastically. The officials and people of our country also feel gratified for this first naval battle to defend East Asia, and pay tribute to famous generals such as Marshal Togo, Marshal Yamamoto, and Lieutenant Commander Hirose, the souls of the allied navy. The reporter specially visited Navy Minister Admiral Ren Yuandao on the 25th and was honored to receive his remarks, acknowledging that the Japanese navy's decades of meritorious service in defending East Asia is a model to follow, and hoping that the joint Sino-Japanese fleet will appear on the Pacific Ocean together in the future. The Naval Minister Ren's remarks are recorded below: "In the 38th year of Meiji, Marshal Togo, a holy general of Japan, led the combined fleet and fought bravely, annihilating the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet on May 27th. This great war result can be said to be illustrious in the world, so Japan has designated this May 27th as Navy Memorial Day to commemorate this great achievement, which has now been 38 years of history. Japan uses this May 27th to commemorate the navy, its significance is very profound, not only arousing the patriotic heart of the people, especially Japan's consistent work to eliminate European and American aggression and protect the integrity of East Asia, this battle is the starting point. Therefore, the meaning of Navy Memorial Day is to fully express the spirit of Japanese morality, and now it has become a memorial day for the entire East Asian moral spirit. Its scope has actually expanded from the navy to the entire nation, and from Japan to the entire East Asia. At that time, the Imperial Russian naval forces had a tendency to dominate the Pacific. For the sake of its own survival and the preservation of East Asia, Japan resolutely fought against Imperial Russia. In the decisive battle, the Japanese navy, under the command of Marshal Togo, used its belief that every battle would be won, and finally annihilated the Imperial Russian navy of equal strength, captured its warships, and captured its main generals. The greatness of the war results was unprecedented. This was all due to the consistent unity of the navy generals and soldiers, who held the utmost sincerity of loyalty to the emperor and serving the country, so they only counted on fighting bravely to kill the enemy and did not care about anything else. This kind of determination is extremely admirable. Now when we think of Marshal Togo's encouragement to the generals and soldiers, there is a training speech that the rise and fall of the empire are at stake in this battle, and his generous and impassioned attitude can express the great spirit of our East Asian nation, and naturally we cannot help but be excited to the extreme." Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese navy has used its traditional spirit to cooperate with the army and air force to destroy the evil forces of Britain and the United States in Asia. Now, on the occasion of the 38th Navy Memorial Day, Japan celebrates it enthusiastically throughout the country. All of our East Asian nations feel the same, especially the emerging naval officers and soldiers of our country should learn from the spirit of the pioneers and jointly shoulder the responsibility of liberating East Asia.</p>

<h3>The Soul of the Navy (3): Admiral Togo on the Mikasa</h3>
<p>— Tsuruzo Ishii</p>
<p>"Regarding the newly arrived enemy fleet, I swear to sink it to reassure His Majesty," was the answer of Admiral Togo, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, to the Emperor's concerns before commanding the great naval battle of the Sea of Japan. At this time, the Admiral already had a plan in mind.</p>
<p>Not long after, on May 27, 38th year of Meiji, the Great General Headquarters issued the first report: "Upon receiving the alert that the old enemy had been discovered, the Combined Fleet immediately set out to prepare to defeat the enemy. Although the sky was clear that day, the waves were quite high." At 1:30 pm, our main force met the enemy's main force for the first time. As the distance between them gradually decreased to 8,000 meters, Commander Togo, who had been silently staring at the enemy, raised his right hand very high and suddenly waved it to the left. Chief of Staff Kato understood the Commander's intention and ordered, "Captain, go forward at full speed." As a result, he rushed to the front of the enemy ship and gained the advantage of overwhelming the enemy's front row. The outcome of the battle had already been decided in less than half an hour of shelling. The reason for this was actually due to the Commander Togo's wave of his right hand to the left. Assuming that the body was hit by enemy bullets and the war could achieve the most effective result, that was based on the belief that victory was certain, and this wave of the hand had such a profound meaning.

<h3>German Air Force Active on the Eastern Front, Destroys a Large Soviet Aircraft Factory: Germany Clears Soviet Guerrillas on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Presidential Headquarters announced the battle situation in a communiqué at noon on the 25th as follows: (1) On the Eastern Front, German assault teams have begun operations in several areas. (2) The German Air Force will bombard Soviet railway facilities and bomb a large Soviet aircraft factory in the middle reaches of the Volga River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Colonel Hama, a correspondent for the German News Agency Lishton, said that both sides are stepping up preparations for large-scale military activities on the Eastern Front. Strong Soviet troops can be seen concentrated in the western Caucasus near the Kuban bridgehead. Heavy troops are being assembled in the center between Moscow and Kursk, and south of Leningrad District Moscow. It is certain that a lot of weapons have been deployed there, along with strong tank units and mechanized detachments. The number of Soviet troops concentrated in the lower reaches of the Kuban River is smaller, but the project is important. The public believes that the Soviet army plans to launch large-scale military operations against the German southern wing and the northern part of the central region, as it did in the winter of last year. What the German army intends to do is still unknown. In addition to preparing to resist the expected Soviet summer offensive, the German army command also has many divisions and offensive troops to allocate. Therefore, the German army's military operations on the Eastern Front are completely unaffected by the Soviet army's actions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to military sources from the German New Open News Agency, the German army began a large-scale sweep of Soviet guerrillas operating behind the German lines on Sunday. One of the teams, which was resupplied by the Soviet army from the air and waterways, has been cleared. The German army destroyed more than 120 bunkers and more than 20 other guerrilla camps, which were filled with large quantities of military supplies and food. The German army also discovered and destroyed them. The German army's dispatch this time was assisted by Russian volunteer soldiers, which was very effective.</p>
<h3>Director Hagi of the News Department Gives a Speech in Yokohama</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Equipment and objects can be produced as much as possible, but manpower is not the same. How will the British and Americans replenish the countless deaths, injuries, and illnesses of the three services of sea, land, and air? It is questionable. In addition, the sailors of the sea transport, which is regarded as the lifeline of the United States and Britain, have already suffered significant depletion, and their efficiency is also declining day by day. All of this is a confirmed fact. In the air battles in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Burma, their casualties were ten times higher than ours. This is enough to prove that their quality is also extremely low because of the difficulty in replenishing air force soldiers. Secondly, in terms of the time issue, there is no doubt that the longer the war lasts, the more it will benefit the Axis powers. Japan has now established an invincible political and military posture in the mainland and the Pacific. The strategy of fighting while building and using war to support war is quickly and smoothly becoming a reality. This is well known. Given the years, Japan has formed a posture that cannot be broken no matter how strong the world is united. This has been repeatedly pointed out by the Chongqing government and the Australian authorities. The Greater East Asia War is not a war of destruction and consumption, but a war of construction and production. As a result of the war, Japan has now become a completely resource-rich country. In a long-term war of attrition, it can exert great power. The United States has reached its peak in production by the end of this year, and the situation after that may decline. Therefore, the longer the war is prolonged, the weaker the war power will be for the United States and Britain. To give an example, from the perspective of the British and American shipping relationship, the combined shipbuilding capacity of the two countries is 10 million tons per year, and the number of ships sunk is about one million tons per month. In that case, the ship retention of the United States and Britain must continue to decline, and they will inevitably face a time when they break their retention of [ ] million tons. In the message submitted by Roosevelt to the 78th Congress of the United States, he said that 1943 was the year of attack, and it was decided to counterattack from the Aleutian Islands in the north, strengthen support for Chongqing in the west, increase the air force stationed in Chongqing, counterattack Burma, and consolidate the bases of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the south. It attempts to tighten the encirclement of Japan, and even advocates launching air raids on the Japanese mainland, even at the cost of any major sacrifices. Therefore, there will be many changes in the future war situation, and temporary local losses may be possible, but considering the vastness of the war zone and the length of the war, temporary local fluctuations are not enough to affect the final war situation, and there is no need to be happy or worried. All our people should unite as one, and we are sure that there will be a glorious victory on this road of war. (The end)</p>

<h3>Near the Aleutian Islands, a Major Battle is Imminent</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - American naval commentator Herbert stated yesterday in a broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation that prominent American naval experts predict that the American and Japanese navies will soon engage in a major battle in the Aleutian Islands. He pointed out that the sudden appearance of Japanese aircraft over Attu Island suggests that Japanese aircraft carriers are operating near the Aleutian Islands, thus indicating a large Japanese naval force in the area.</p>
<p>Argentina, the capital, 26th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Navy Department has neither denied nor confirmed the reports from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters regarding the achievements of the Japanese naval air force and submarine units in the waters off Attu Island. Regarding the battle situation on Attu Island, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox, when meeting with a group of reporters on the 25th, only stated that, regarding the battle situation on Attu Island, there was nothing to add beyond what has already been published in the Navy Department's official announcements, but that the fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Marshal Yamamoto's Spirit Lives On</h3>
<p>Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto killed in action! The death of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, is not a dream, but an undeniable fact. Marshal Yamamoto first launched the attack that destroyed the American fleet at Hawaii, achieving a victory unprecedented in naval history, which Japan has since secured. The Japanese navy revered Marshal Yamamoto like a benevolent father, and countless citizens admired Marshal Yamamoto as a peerless hero. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War a year and a half ago, the men of the naval air force have become the masters of the Pacific. Marshal Yamamoto led from the front, taking to the skies in his aircraft, commanding operations across a vast front of thousands of miles. Unfortunately, he fell victim to enemy counterattacks, and this loyal, heroic, and renowned general became a guardian spirit of the nation on the southern seas.</p>
<p>Alas! Though Admiral Yamamoto has given his life, the "Yamamoto Spirit" that we know is immortal and will continue to bear the task of defending the Pacific! The "Yamamoto Spirit" moved the hearts and minds of countless young admirals who will follow in his footsteps... In the past year and a half of the Greater East Asia War, the patriotic fervor of every individual who has sacrificed their lives has reached a boiling point. May the heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto watch over us, as countless citizens rise up with unwavering determination to engage and defeat the enemy ahead!</p>
<p>Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto was born on April 4th, Meiji 17 (1884), in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture. He was the fourth son of Sadakichi Takano, a retainer of the Nagaoka domain. At the time of Marshal Yamamoto's birth, his father was already fifty-six years old, hence the name "Isoroku" (fifty-six). His family was poor but honorable, and he was diligent and hardworking. He was intelligent from a young age. The Yamamoto family, a prominent family in the area, had no heir, so he was adopted, and thus changed his surname. Marshal Yamamoto was a natural-born military leader and had aspirations for the navy from childhood. In November of Meiji 37 (1904), he graduated from the Naval Academy. His classmates included Admirals Shiozawa, Yoshida, and Shimada, as well as Vice Admiral Teikichi Hori. At that time, the Russo-Japanese War was raging. Marshal Yamamoto, as an ensign candidate, served on the battleship Nisshin of the First Fleet. In May of Meiji 38 (1905), he participated in the Battle of Tsushima, where he was struck by shrapnel, losing two fingers on his left hand and suffering severe burns to his right leg. The following year, the government awarded him a military injury medal. The Marshal, who was wounded while fighting for his country, was honored with the first injury medal.</p>
<p>In Taisho 4 (1915), he was appointed a lieutenant commander in the navy. In Taisho 5 (1916), he graduated from the Naval War College. In Taisho 8 (1919), he was dispatched to the United States as a naval attaché, where he meticulously studied the American situation. Before long, Marshal Yamamoto was not only familiar with the U.S. Navy, but also had a deep understanding of the general American character. This was the result of his diligent study while in the United States. It is said that Marshal Yamamoto had the following anecdote while in the United States:</p>
<p>When Marshal Yamamoto was in the United States, he never frequented social gatherings with wine and women. Instead, whenever he had free time, he would go to the shooting range to practice his artillery skills. He often said: "When Japan cannot achieve something with brains, I will solve it with strength."</p>
<p>One day, Marshal Yamamoto visited the Naval Academy in Annapolis. He entered a classroom and saw a war game diagram of a future Pacific war between Japan and the United States drawn on the blackboard. At that moment, the American instructor, seeing a Japanese officer visiting, hurriedly said: "We are lecturing on the current situation in the Pacific." Marshal Yamamoto strode into the classroom, smiled, and said: "Excuse me for interrupting. We will meet again in the Pacific someday!"</p>
<p>In Taisho 10 (1921), when the Washington Naval Conference began, Marshal Yamamoto, stationed in Boston, was summoned to Washington to assist plenipotentiary representative Kijuro Shidehara, along with Admiral Nagano, the current Chief of the Naval General Staff. Marshal Yamamoto, who detested compromise, revealed his determination to stand firm to all the representatives. In December of the same year, he returned to Japan and taught at the Naval War College, passing on all the knowledge he had acquired in the United States to his students. In view of the tense situation following the Washington Naval Conference regarding naval arms reduction, he was once again ordered abroad in Taisho 12 (1923), visiting various countries in Europe and America. In the same year, he was promoted to captain. The following year, he returned to Japan and became the chief professor and adjutant of the Kasumigaura Air Group.</p>
<p>Marshal Yamamoto had long emphasized expanding the naval aviation force and was willing to take on the difficult task of cultivating future airmen. This was the beginning of his efforts.</p>
<p>In Taisho 14 (1925), he was dispatched as a naval attaché to the Japanese Embassy in the United States, becoming the unrivaled expert on America in the navy. In Showa 3 (1928), he was appointed captain of the cruiser Isuzu, and then captain of the aircraft carrier Akagi. In Showa 4 (1929), he was promoted to rear admiral. At the London Naval Conference in the same year, he went as a specialist committee member under Vice Admiral Sakonji, assisting plenipotentiary representatives Wakatsuki and Takarabe. Through the Washington and London Naval Conferences, Marshal Yamamoto was fully confident in the future of naval aviation. After returning, he put this ideal into practice. In Showa 5 (1930), he was appointed head of the Naval Aviation Department of Technology, and in Showa 8 (1933), he became commander of the 1st Air Fleet, working hard to train the naval air force.</p>
<p>In Showa 9 (1934), he was specially dispatched as the representative of the Japanese Empire to London to attend the preliminary negotiations for the Naval Arms Reduction Conference. "Isoroku Yamamoto's name shook the world, maneuvering between the cunning British and American Ministers of War, attracting attention." While actively involved in London, he was promoted to vice admiral. In Showa 10 (1935), the preliminary negotiations were completed, and he returned to Japan without dishonoring his mission, maintaining Japan's consistent position of equal naval power with Britain and the United States. During those preliminary negotiations, the current Minister of the Imperial Household, Matsudaira, like Representative Yamamoto, strongly opposed British and American tactics, advocating for the establishment of equal military rights and the abolition of the ratio system, expressing a firm attitude of no retreat.</p>
<p>In Showa 10 (1935), he was appointed head of the Naval Aviation Department. In Showa 11 (1936), he served as Vice Minister under Naval Minister Nagano, and in Showa 12 (1937), when Admiral Yonai joined the cabinet as Naval Minister, Marshal Yamamoto continued to serve as Vice Minister, continuing to assist Admiral Yonai. Subsequently, during the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, Admiral Yonai remained in office, and the internal affairs of the Navy remained orderly and unchaotic, thanks to these military and political skills, creating today's invincible naval force.</p>
<p>In August of Showa 14 (1939), he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, bearing the fate of the nation on his shoulders. In the stormy Pacific, he did not yield one step to Britain and the United States. All this relied on Admiral Yamamoto laying the firm foundation of the Japanese Navy during his lifetime. In November of Showa 15 (1940), he was promoted to admiral at the same time as Admirals Yoshida and Shimada. Under the leadership of Marshal Yamamoto, the navy was actively trained in preparation for any eventuality. On December 8th, Showa 16 (1941), the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was promulgated, shaking the world and changing the tactics of naval warfare forever. The successful surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was the immortal pyramid built by Marshal Yamamoto, and the achievement of the naval air force trained by him. For the past twenty years, after the Washington and London Treaties, the Japanese Navy endured one humiliation after another, finally breaking the weakness of the ratio with Britain and the United States in the Battle of Hawaii, creating an unprecedented feat in history.</p>
<p>His Majesty the Emperor commended the great achievements of the Navy and again bestowed an Imperial Rescript to encourage Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, no military honor was greater than that of Marshal Yamamoto. Upon receiving the Imperial command, the Marshal vowed to dedicate himself completely to repay the Emperor's grace. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy's brilliant achievements have astonished the world. While its success was undoubtedly due to divine favor, it was also largely due to the Marshal's many years of hard work. Moreover, the Marshal's proper management of the military, his frequent visits to the front lines to encourage the officers and men, or to comfort the wounded soldiers, and his sharing of hardships with the soldiers at the front, greatly inspired them.</p>
<p>He died on the 4th of this month, bravely killed in action while leading operations on the front lines. The supreme commander of a great naval power sacrificing his life for his country in battle is unprecedented since Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar. The people of the entire nation, who had hoped for his triumphant return, could not help but express their infinite grief at the Marshal's death. Marshal Yamamoto, who had always been committed to living and dying with the Imperial Navy, was able to give his life under the wings of the naval air force he had nurtured. It can be said that this was the Marshal's long-cherished wish. As the saying goes, "to die in the right place," Marshal's martyrdom can be said to be worthy of his life.

<h3>Today is Japanese Navy Day; Grand Celebrations Unfold; Captain Kamada Discusses Naval Construction</h3>
<p>Today is Japanese Navy Day, and various grand celebrations are being held in this city. The Japanese Naval Fleet Press Department especially invited reporters from the Central News Agency and various newspapers to a reception at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 26th) in the department's conference room. Captain Kamada, head of the Fleet Press Department, presided, with Masao Kawasaki serving as the translator.</p>
<p>Standards of Ship Age</p>
<p>The chairman first delivered a speech, stating in essence: The reason for inviting everyone today is that tomorrow is Japanese Navy Day. Furthermore, considering that everyone visited the Izumo warship yesterday, I hope you will freely express your opinions and, in your news reports, awaken a deep understanding of the navy's importance among your countrymen. The nation should urgently mobilize to build up the navy. The Izumo warship, which you inspected yesterday, was built in Meiji 32 (1899) and is now an outdated warship. The construction of the Japanese Navy is progressing daily. According to the naval standards of various countries around the world, the service life of large warships is 24 years, while that of smaller warships is 16 years. Therefore, the Izumo warship is only used for coastal defense. Therefore, the United States' propaganda of transferring 50 old warships to Britain is, in fact, of no use, and we need not overemphasize it.</p>
<p>Two Great Records</p>
<p>Japan has achieved two great records in two major naval battles, which have given the world a new understanding of the navy. First, in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan annihilated the Tsarist Russian fleet. At the time, all countries were shocked, and it was recognized that cannons could penetrate the iron armor of warships. As a result, countries began researching the firepower of cannons. Second, in the current Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy deployed naval aircraft to sink the British battleship Prince of Wales with torpedoes. As a result, countries recognized that modern warships should study how to avoid being sunk by aircraft. Therefore, countries simultaneously recognized that the navy should be supported by the air force to achieve greater effectiveness.</p>
<p>Chinese Navy</p>
<p>Finally, a reporter raised the question of building a Chinese navy. Captain Kamada then delivered his great insights, stating that China already had a powerful navy in the Yuan Dynasty, which had even sent expeditions to Hungary. At that time, Japan did not yet have such large ships. Japan's naval construction began in the Meiji era and has taken 91 years to reach its current state. To revitalize East Asia, a powerful East Asian navy must be built. Since China and Japan share a common destiny, Japan should pay close attention to the suggestions for building a Chinese navy. Therefore, I earnestly hope that newspaper reporters will take on the responsibility of promoting this, so that the entire nation gains a new understanding of the navy and unites to work diligently for naval construction. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Information Department Head Hirota Explains American Immigration Law</h3>
<p>The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Information Department Head Hirota, expressed his views on the recently proposed amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act by the U.S. Senate during the regular meeting of the Chinese newspaper reporter group in this city at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th).</p>
<p>Prohibition of Entry</p>
<p>First, he cited the Chinese Exclusion Act, one of the American anti-Chinese laws, which began in 1882 and was formally passed by the U.S. government in 1923. It stipulated that Chinese citizens who had not naturalized as American citizens were prohibited from entering the country. Even those requesting entry for special reasons were restricted according to the immigration quota of each country, allowing only 107 Chinese immigrants per year. At the same time, it also restricted Japanese people from going to the United States. As a result, the Japanese government lodged a serious protest. The Japanese ambassador to Washington, Uehara Masanao, sent a note to the U.S. government, which stated in essence: Based on the principles of relations between nations, Japanese people, even if they have not naturalized as American citizens, should have the right to enter the United States. Otherwise, this discriminatory treatment would be a great insult, which the Japanese government greatly regrets. However, because the friendly relations between Japan and the United States must continue to be maintained, it is hoped that there will be some improvement. If this provision remains, it may cause serious consequences in the future, which this ambassador cannot foresee.</p>
<p>Complete Reckoning</p>
<p>After the U.S. received this protest, not only did it fail to improve the situation, but it also followed its usual practice, interpreting the phrase "serious consequences" in the protest as a threat from Japan and demanding that the Japanese government recall its ambassador to Washington. At the time, the Japanese people were greatly angered by this issue and repeatedly protested, but they were met with unreasonable arguments from the United States, which became increasingly severe and unresolved. As a result, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War can be said to have been mainly caused by this immigration law. The humiliation we felt in the past will be completely reckoned in this war, in order to resolve the issue. Regarding the recent proposal by U.S. Senators Cain and others in the Senate to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act, it is actually a wartime expedient by the U.S. government. Its intention is that the U.S. is aware of the inadequacy of its material aid to Chongqing, which has aroused resentment from Chongqing. Especially at present, when Chongqing is showing a tendency to break away from the anti-Axis powers, the U.S. is using its usual tactics to amend the immigration law in the hope of easing the situation and winning over Chongqing. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, it is not only the United States that adopts restrictions on Chinese immigration.</p>
<p>The Shame of East Asia</p>
<p>That includes Britain and its territories, such as Canada, India, Australia, Malaya, South Africa, and Central and South America. Furthermore, Britain passed the Land Act in the South African Union, which prohibits Indian people from owning land. This is a law to exclude Indian people, showing that both Britain and the United States despise the nations of East Asia, which is a shame for the nations of East Asia. Therefore, cooperation between Chongqing and Britain and the United States will be difficult to achieve the ultimate goal. Chongqing's attitude of opposing East Asian national cooperation is a mistake on Chongqing's part. This American immigration law is not only a problem for the Chinese people, but also a problem for the hundreds of millions of people in East Asia. All East Asian nations should rise up and resist. Therefore, Britain and the United States despise East Asia, and not only China and Japan must stand up, but all East Asian people should rise up to drive out the evil influence of Britain and the United States in East Asia.</p>

At the same time, it is also learned that the cooking oil wholesale association has begun processing the third-round household oil distribution, which is expected to be widely available by the end of this month, or at the latest, the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters Expresses Condolences for Marshal Yamamoto</h3>
<p>Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, led the Japanese Navy in the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, achieving outstanding feats. Now, unfortunately, he has died a heroic death in battle. The news of his death has shocked the world. Ling Xianwen, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters, specially dispatched Section Chief Du Mengsen to the Japanese Navy Attache Office in Shanghai to express his deep respect and condolences.</p>
<h3>Welfare Association Teas to Welcome Ambassador Sawada</h3>
<p>Former Japanese Ambassador to France Sawada and Minister Yanai arrived in Shanghai by plane from Tokyo the day before yesterday (the 25th) for an inspection. They will stay for five or six days, then go to Hankou, Nanjing, and other places, and then go north. Ambassador Sawada is a well-known figure in the Japanese diplomatic circle. His elder brother is also a diplomat and served as ambassador to the United States. The brothers look very much alike, and they are often mistaken for each other at meetings, which is a popular anecdote. The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Wen Lantao, Lin Kanghou, and Zhao Jinqing, and all the directors will hold a tea party at the Conluxe Hotel at 4:30 PM tomorrow (the 28th) to welcome them.</p>

Recently, we have been holding performances at the Queen Theater on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, which have been well-received by society.

<h3>Japanese Authorities in Shanghai Decide to Jointly Host Press Corps Weekly</h3>
<p>The Japanese authorities in Shanghai will host the regular meetings of the Chinese press corps in the city every Wednesday and Thursday. According to sources, the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai office and the Army and Navy will jointly hold these meetings every Friday at the Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Sale of Rationed Cigarettes Not Effective</h3>
<p>According to sources close to the cigarette rationing authorities, retailers often sell a very small number of the allocated cigarettes to the public at the set price, while reselling the rest elsewhere. Two weeks ago, the Central China Tobacco Rationing Association issued trade regulations. However, even the clause "Businesses should announce the quantity of cigarettes allocated and the date of allocation at the storefront" has been completely undermined because retailers do not have fixed hours for selling goods. According to a widespread survey conducted yesterday, it was learned that the trade regulations set by the Central China Tobacco Rationing Association have not had any effect, and the regulation prohibiting children from buying rationed cigarettes at the set price has also not been implemented in practice. The rationing authorities had declared that if retailers violated the trade regulations, the supply of rationed cigarettes would be suspended. According to well-informed sources, rationed cigarettes are often found in nightclubs and other entertainment venues, where they are sold at inflated prices.</p>

<h3>Female Teacher Dies After Being Humiliated, Public Outrage in the Education Sector</h3>
<p>Ms. Liu Wangmin, a woman from Anhui, residing at No. 4, Lane 393, Pingliang Road, is 41 years old. Her 13-year-old son, Liu Junzhi, is a student at the Sacred Heart Elementary School in the same lane. On the 18th of this month, Liu Junzhi had an argument with a classmate during class and was reprimanded by his homeroom teacher, Su Yizhi. Unexpectedly, Liu Junzhi returned home and complained to his mother, Liu Wangmin, who became very angry. She rushed to the school and, without asking for details, slapped Teacher Su twice. Teacher Su, feeling humiliated, swallowed her anger and did not resist. On the 24th, Liu Junzhi again had an argument with a student named Zhang. After returning home, his mother rushed to the school again and used barbaric methods. In addition to slapping Su Yizhi, she also punched her in the chest and abdomen. As a result, Su suddenly died. The principal reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, where Deputy Detective Jiang Linxiang and Detective Chen Fukang were assigned to investigate. The body was transported to the autopsy station for examination. Liu Wangmin was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. In addition to explaining the case, the police requested that she be detained because Su's body had not yet been examined. Judge Du approved the detention of Liu Wangmin pending examination of the body. After this incident, the education sector was particularly outraged. Yesterday, colleagues jointly appealed to all sectors for assistance for the deceased. They also took a petition to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies at 4 p.m. yesterday to request assistance. The deceased's family has only one sister and a young brother, and her life has been disrupted, so her situation after death is very bleak, and funeral expenses must also rely on relatives and friends to find a way.</p>

<p>Economic World Translations and Essays</p>
<h3>The Significance of Food Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>The National Government issued 400 million yuan of food treasury bonds, entrusting the Central Reserve Bank to release them to all parties.</p>
<p>This policy makes many contributions to the food problem and the general price problem. The funds obtained from the sale of food treasury bonds are all used for the rice purchase and allocation business under the supervision of the Food Department. This will not only promote the efficiency of the above-mentioned business, but also absorb a large amount of floating capital in Shanghai and other cities, casting an effective method on the crux of the price problem. In terms of economic significance, it is quite significant.</p>
<p>In addition to first mountain China Banking Corporation and insurance companies, enterprise trust companies, etc., purchasing a considerable amount, the issuance method of food treasury bonds also encourages the public to purchase, and Japanese financial institutions also purchase as much as possible. In addition, the released treasury bonds can be repurchased by the Reserve Bank when necessary, or used as collateral for loans. The intention is extremely thorough. Looking at the above measures and extrapolating from the economic situation of the peaceful area, it is expected that the issuance of food treasury bonds will definitely be successful.</p>
<p>One more point worth noting is that this food extension bond has a term of only one year and an extremely low interest rate of only 4.5%. If it can be digested quickly and achieve the predetermined results, it will be equivalent to the peace government gaining a great victory in finance.</p>
<p>Issuing 400 million yuan of food treasury bonds to absorb floating capital and give it a proper outlet will definitely make a major contribution to the general price policy. There is no other way to suppress prices than to absorb surplus purchasing power. The self-discipline of financial institutions and the contraction of loans have a major effect on suppressing rising prices. However, now that the issuance of food treasury bonds has been decided, the process of self-discipline will inevitably be further promoted, and the rising trend of prices can also be easily suppressed. The figure of 400 million yuan is not too large compared with the figure of hoarding, but absorbing 400 million yuan of floating capital has a significant economic significance.</p>
<p>We hope that the National Government authorities will make every effort to promote the digestion of treasury bonds. At the same time, we believe that the Japanese side will also provide full assistance to support the National Government to achieve this goal.

<h3>Undertaking Class A Food Treasury Bonds Promoting Transfer Banks and Money Shops Treasury Bonds Can Also Be Mortgaged for Loans</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the financial community, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to promote the transfer of the Class A food treasury bonds it undertakes to banks, trust companies, money shops, and private individuals. The issuance of this type of treasury bond is not only beneficial to financial institutions in terms of the disposal of floating capital, but can also guide floating capital into the right track, becoming a good mechanism for capital operation. At the same time, by digesting the abundant funds in the market through food treasury bonds, it can flow back to the Central Reserve Bank. Solving the price problem, which is of concern to the whole of China, is really beneficial. In addition, if financial institutions that have purchased food treasury bonds need funds in the future, they can be taken in at the original interest rate at any time, and they can also use the treasury bonds as collateral to apply for low-interest loans from the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<h3>Director Liao of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station Visited Shanghai to Inspect the Cotton Seed Field</h3>
<p>Mr. Liao Jianan, Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, led Senior Technician Gu Boming to Shanghai yesterday. Accompanied by Director Shao of the Shanghai Cotton Management Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, they visited the Beiqiao Cotton Field. Mr. Liao highly praised the facilities of the field and the various ongoing experimental works. Director Shao also discussed in detail the plan of the Shanghai Cotton Management Area. In addition to the Beiqiao Breeding Field, there are also the Pudong Yangsi Breeding Field and the Chongming Breeding Field. For the promotion of the entire cotton crop, it is also planned to contribute to the Central Government, dividing Central China into three major cotton promotion areas, namely, the Suhuai-Subei and northern Anhui area as a demonstration field, located near Ningshu, with Ningshu as the center; the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-eastern Zhejiang area as the second area, with Shanghai as the center; and the area along the Yangtze River, Jiangxi, Hubei, and southern Anhui as the third area, with the area near Jiujiang as the center. He also requested the Central Agricultural Institute to provide specific guidance and train middle and lower-level technical personnel to be assigned to each place to meet urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Convened the First Representative Symposium Yesterday to Discuss Many Important Economic Cases</h3>
<p>The first liaison meeting of various civic groups in this city, held for the purpose of close contact, was convened by the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association at 3 p.m. yesterday. Attendees included Ye Deming of the East Asia League Branch, Jian Jianwu of the Anti-British and American Association, Jiang Wan of the Hongmen United Association, Zhou Bogan of the Youth Construction Team, Zhu Ding of the East Asia Anti-Communist League, and Chen Jin of the Xingya Society. Jian Jianwu was elected chairman. First, Ye Deming of the East Asia League reported on the preparations for the symposium of representatives of various groups. Then, the following important cases were discussed and decided: (1) To suggest to the government to improve the organization of the National Commercial Control General Association, implement wartime material control, balance prices, and, to the extent possible, have representatives of civic groups with acute material concerns participate and assume the responsibility of supervision, and to suggest that the government add a research institution to the National Commercial Control Association. (2) The integration of the economies of North China, Central China, and South China, including currency unification, balancing exchange rates, and material exchange issues. (3) The organization of an economic research committee, with the East Asia League, Hongmen, Anti-British and American Xingya Society, Youth Team, and other groups each sending one representative to prepare.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding Establish a Materials Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate the illegal hoarding of large quantities of essential materials by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, the National Government, through the 14th decision of the Supreme National Defense Conference, decided to establish a Materials Investigation Committee in Shanghai. Sixteen officials from Chinese and Japanese agencies will be appointed as members to jointly organize it. Preparations are currently underway. As soon as the authorities have drafted the organizational rules and laws of the committee, they will convene a meeting of Chinese and Japanese members in Shanghai in the near future to formally announce the establishment of the organization.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Settlement Shanghai Municipal Council Notice Announced May 26, 1943</h3>
<p>No. 6362 (Regarding Price Limits for Bread and Flour)</p>
<p>Notice is hereby given that the Bureau has decided to cancel the price limits for bread and flour contained in Notice No. 5357 of May 19 of this year. The following new price limits will be implemented in the Public Settlement from May 26 of this year: Bread Wholesale 5 yuan and 90 cents per pound Retail 6 yuan and 30 cents per pound (both include packaging, weight exceeding or falling short of one pound will be calculated proportionally) Flour Retail to holders of bread certificates with flour coupons 5 yuan and 20 cents per pound (packaging excluded) This notice is hereby given for general information. Superintendent Ozawa Sei</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Specialized Committee to be Established Commercial Control Association Has Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the internal organization of the National Commercial Control General Association, in addition to the completion of the organization of various departments and the handling of material movement permits, is actively urging the organization of the joint associations of various industries in the lower part. At present, the Chemical Industry and Soap and Candle Industry Joint Association and the Flour and Wheat Specialized Committee have been established, and the trade associations of other industries can be decided to be formed by the end of this month. Regarding the Oil and Grain Specialized Committee, it was rumored yesterday that it had been formally formed. According to a report by a Central News Agency reporter who inquired with the Commercial Control Association, it is unreliable, and the association is still considering whether the Oil and Grain Specialized Committee needs to be organized, so the various rumors are false propaganda, and the association is conducting an investigation.</p>
<h3>The Formation of Trade Associations is Postponed for Half a Month</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control General Association's lower-level organization, the Trade Association of Various Industries, was originally scheduled to be completely organized and established by the end of this month. It is now learned that the Commercial Control Association, in view of the fact that the organizational work of the various associations is being actively carried out, but the time is too short, it may be difficult to completely organize and establish them before the end of this month, so it has postponed the deadline by another half month, setting the deadline for all the associations to be formally announced as established by June 15.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks showed some strength at first, but suddenly turned flat and weak at noon. This is because, after a long period of stock price declines, it is not easy for all parties to boost morale for a while. The current sellers are still waiting to see how things develop. Before the end of the month, it is feared that the market will be in a state of fluctuation. Trading is not active, and the new pharmaceutical industry is showing significant prosperity. China-France Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory have both risen close to the threshold. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Power are stagnant at their previous prices, with little trading. Nanyang Tobacco Company showed little change; Da Zhonghua Match Factory alone saw a decline. Wing On Company rebounded strongly, while Sincere and National Goods Company also saw an increase. The cultural industry remained stagnant. Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company all showed no change. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile and Mei Ya Silk Factory are both making progress. Other miscellaneous stocks such as Zhongxing Timber, Jingfu Woodworking Machine, and Tongyi Trust were all firm. Jiu'an Industrial and Xin Yi Real Estate showed a stagnant trend. China Clock Factory remained weak, and there were buyers only at face value. There was little trading in financial and food stocks.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Will Not Increase in Price Stores Already Have Legal Profits</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors that coal briquettes will increase in price again, but this is unfounded. It is hoped that the current price of coal briquettes will remain unchanged, and there is no possibility of change. As for the raw materials (coal) used to manufacture coal briquettes, they mainly come from Hebei and Korea. Because the source is continuous, the bottom stock is also very full. However, the current production price has increased slightly, increasing by 7 Central Reserve Notes per ton, and transportation costs have also increased slightly by 12 yuan compared with the past. However, manufacturers have not been threatened in any way, because the price of coal briquettes has increased from 25 yuan per dan to 32.5 yuan (650 yuan per ton), and the factory price is 550 yuan per ton, so manufacturers can get a net profit of more than 100 yuan per ton, and retailers can get about 70 yuan. In addition, the Association of Hot Water Shops has requested to resume selling "hot water at the flat price per catty of coal." It is now learned that the Coal Number Association is very sympathetic to the situation of the industry, especially the price of coal supplied to Tiger Stove for combustion. The person in charge of the Hot Water Shop Association is still considering it.</p>
<h3>Not Many New Broad Beans are Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Broad beans, a supplementary food for the people, have now reached the season for new production. It is said that at the beginning of flowering, it was affected by the climate, but recently the weather has been good, and the harvest is considered not bad, and 60-70% of the large ones can be predicted in the countryside. However, the general people mostly pick them to fill their hunger, so it is difficult to expect too many to be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Activities of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Chemical Industry The Chemical Industry Joint Association, a lower-level organization of the National Commercial Control Association, has been prepared and convened a general meeting of all members yesterday to establish the association. A total of more than 70 member representatives from three provinces and two cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui attended. Secretary-General Zhang Peishen of the Commercial Control Association attended and guided the meeting. Chairman Lu Zhixue reported on the preparations. After the meeting, the articles of association were discussed, revised, and directors and supervisors were elected. A total of 21 directors were elected, including Lu Zhixue, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, and Zhou Bangjun. Eleven supervisors were elected, including Qian Nianzu and Yuan Hesong.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Industry Recently, miscellaneous grains from various places will be successively produced. In order to discuss the production and sales cooperation policy and allocation matters, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Joint Association of various regions has specifically decided to convene a general meeting on the 10th of next month. At that time, detailed decisions will be made on transportation and other plans. It is also heard that the chairman of the association, Mr. Fu Qiankeng, has made a special trip to Beijing yesterday to discuss important matters. At the same time, Mr. Lu Wenzhao, the person in charge of the Rice Joint Venture, also went to Beijing to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Soap and Candle Industry The Soap and Candle Industry Joint Association has been prepared and convened an establishment meeting at the Youth Association of Eight Immortals Bridge at 3 p.m. yesterday. It is found that the joint association is composed of the trade associations of soap and candle manufacturers and vendors in various cities and counties in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, and various regions in Suhuai and eastern Zhejiang. More than 140 member representatives from various places attended. Secretary-General Zhang of the Commercial Control Association and others attended and guided the meeting. Chairman Li Zufan reported on the preparation process. After discussing the draft articles of association, 21 directors were elected, including Lu Zhixue and Zhou Bangjun, and 11 supervisors were elected, including Han Zukang.</p>
<p>Dear Sister Lanfang:</p>
<p>Your departure seems to have unspeakable reasons. However, for the sake of your family, your old mother, and your own future, you should think twice. How should the complex and confusing evolution be dealt with? I am uneasy about the fact that you are my sister. Aunt has recently relapsed with her old illness. How can I comfort others when I cannot comfort myself? Moreover, your brother's career is about to begin and has been stopped for my sake and yours. Sister, you are smart. You should handle things well for the sake of the overall situation and yourself. I hope you will come to my place as soon as you see the newspaper. Any matter can be discussed at length. Do not make a mistake. Your cousin Xiaomei.</p>

<h3>Special Edition Commemorating the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day Navy Memorial Day: Outlook on the Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Takamichi Shiota</p>
<p>(1) The World History Is in Transition</p>
<p>Since we decided to crush the will of the United States and Great Britain and shatter the combined British, American, and Dutch fleets in the Pacific, one victory after another has been reported. The second Navy Memorial Day has arrived—the 38th anniversary of the historic victory of the Battle of the Sea of Japan and the leaping development of the East Asian people. Looking back on the situation 38 years ago, one cannot help but be filled with deep emotion.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight years ago, the nations of East Asia were enslaved. India was a loyal and rich milch cow for Britain. China was the most obedient servant to Britain and America. Japan was Britain's faithful dog in East Asia.</p>
<p>But now, we stand tall. Japan, the faithful dog, has risen to crush the insatiable ambitions of its master for the sake of all humanity, expelling Britain and America from East Asia. Thirty-eight years ago, Britain was no more than a weak nation, and America was still a child. But in those 38 years, Britain plundered vast resources, labor, and money from East Asia, treating it as if it were their right to command the people of the world.</p>
<p>However, once the Japanese Navy stood up, Britain immediately fell from the ranks of first-class nations to become a third-class nation. America was driven beyond the Aleutian and Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>(2) Maritime Nations Create World History</p>
<p>"When a maritime nation makes a great decision regarding the sea, it signifies a turning point in history." This is the esteemed opinion of Mr. Hiraide, the head of the Public Information Section of the Imperial Headquarters. Japan is now advancing toward a turning point in world history.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of its nationhood, Japan has been a maritime nation. For the past year and a half, under the great ideal of national founding, the naval forces have struggled to break through the so-called ABCD (America, Britain, China, Dutch) encirclement. Whether in the raging waves of the North Pacific or the scorching heat of the South Pacific, they have destroyed the military power of Britain and America from the air, land, and sea, achieving great victories that have shaken the world. Looking at world history, Greece created Aegean culture through the Battle of Salamis, and Britain turned world history into its own through the Battle of Trafalgar. Similarly, Japan has become the world's Japan through the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the East Asian people have become a people of the world. The future of the East Asian people is now filled with even greater hope. Therefore, we are now raising the banner of inevitable defeat for Britain and America, which historians of the past and present could only dream of, in the Pacific, and we are advancing in unison to transform the world.</p>
<p>Revising the old order to transform world history is by no means an easy task. The path ahead is undoubtedly fraught with obstacles. Based on the great policy of national founding, as a maritime nation, once we have decided on a major course of action and raised the Z flag in the Pacific, we should move forward regardless of everything else.</p>
<p>Chancellor Hitler once said, "The current war is either the destruction or the development of nations." Therefore, we must remember the ten brave members of the special attack squad who, after writing their farewells in the book "Practicing the Virtue of Returning to the Nation Seven Times," embarked on a journey from which they did not expect to return, with Sydney Harbor as their target. We should not be complacent with great victories but should accurately recognize the current stage and future of the war and move toward its completion.</p>
<p>Recent newspapers have stated that 1943, this year, is the autumn of the decisive battle. Churchill made the bold statement: "Next year or the year after, after defeating Hitler, we will permanently disarm Japan, Germany, and Italy." Roosevelt made a strategic propaganda statement: "This year is the time to bomb the Japanese mainland." The commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Nimitz, said, "We have completed preparations to destroy the industrial areas of Japan." They are all vigorously promoting a large-scale air raid. If these statements are not just propaganda but their actual intentions, then we should implement the decisive battle as soon as possible. We want to hold a fleet review of the elite combined fleet in Washington.</p>
<p>In order to hold a fleet review in Washington, we must emphasize the "final five minutes." The "initial five minutes" and the "final five minutes" are crucial in everything. We have completely won the "initial five minutes," namely, the U.S. leadership carelessly misjudged the strength of the Japanese Naval Air Force. Although they made considerable preparations, the elite Pacific Fleet was reduced to seaweed in Pearl Harbor. Therefore, the remaining issue at this stage is the "final five minutes." In 1918, although Germany maintained a superior front line, it still became a defeated nation, not because of failure on the front line, but because of internal collapse.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must accurately understand the current stage of the war. The nations of East Asia must share joys and sorrows, cooperate unanimously, and strive for the victory of these "final five minutes."</p>
<p>(3) The Form of Naval Warfare in the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Previous wars were histories of the rise and fall of individual nations. However, the current and future wars are extremely complex and global wars involving the rise and fall of multiple nations. Therefore, opposing nations are pouring their entire national strength and the limits of human intelligence into the war. Especially in modern times, due to scientific progress, wars have become so-called scientific wars. The form of war has changed from planar to three-dimensional, and its scale and complexity are incomparable to those of the past. Due to the rapid development of aircraft, the superiority of air power has become an indispensable requirement for naval superiority. Therefore, the former command of the sea cannot be established without command of the air. In short, victory in modern naval warfare cannot be achieved unless command of the air, command of the sea, and command of the land are integrated into one.</p>
<p>Regarding the first item, command of the air, the reconnaissance capability of aircraft is equivalent to the reconnaissance range of five or six cruisers, and its range is equivalent to the one-day sailing distance of a fleet. This is further enhanced by cooperation with submarines, which are extremely developed underwater. As a result, it is extremely difficult to conceal and hide the movement and intentions of military forces. Therefore, the preemptive strike of the "initial five minutes" has become the primary cause of victory. If the enemy cannot be crushed in the initial attack by various means, there is no hope of victory. Until the last European war, fleets anchored in heavily defended ports could safely rest their troops, replenish supplies, and repair their ships with plenty of leeway. But now, with excellent aircraft like those of our Naval Air Force, even if the defenses of U.S. naval ports in the Pacific are heavily fortified, the safety of U.S. ships at anchor is unlikely. Moreover, surface vessels have become excellent targets for airborne torpedoes and underwater torpedoes, making it difficult to escape even at night. Examples include the devastating attack by our bomber force on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the sinking of the British battleship Royal Oak, anchored in its home port, by a German submarine after the start of the war. Therefore, the planning of the preemptive surprise attack in the opening stages of the Greater East Asia War, the Hawaiian Operation, can be fully regarded as the ideal of modern naval warfare theory. Only the Japanese Navy, with its excellent training and skills, could accomplish what Britain and America considered impossible. This is also an example.</p>
<p>However, the movement of aircraft is still greatly affected by the weather in many ways. In addition, the constant threat of submarines is greatly disadvantageous to enemy fleets advancing from afar and advantageous to the defending side. Therefore, we have occupied many coral islands scattered throughout the Pacific, using them as unsinkable aircraft carriers, which fully demonstrates the superiority of our front line. The reason why the United States is determined to recapture these bases from the air and sea is for this reason.</p>
<p>However, according to Roosevelt, attacking from the south and recovering one island occupied by the Japanese army each year, it would take 50 years to completely recover them. In this light, the aspect of the Greater East Asia War can be aptly described as a battle for air bases. Therefore, the Japanese army captured Wake Island, Marcus Island, and the Gilbert Islands at the beginning of the war and used them as bases for attacking the United States. It also captured the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, the Philippine Islands, and the Malay Peninsula. The Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean were also occupied by us. If this area is fully developed into a well-equipped naval base, it will have a different meaning from Singapore as a British base. With this situation, Japan has secured an impregnable position, and it is no exaggeration to say that it has laid the foundation for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Below, we will look at the current situation of aircraft and submarines, which have changed the state of naval warfare in the past:</p>
<p>A. Air Warfare: At the beginning of the war, the U.S. Pacific Fleet was destroyed by the elite Japanese Naval Air Force, and the British Far East Fleet, led by the unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales, was also completely annihilated. As a result, Britain and America lost their excellent maritime mobility and air fleet. Consequently, Hong Kong was captured, Singapore was seized, and the Philippines were occupied. In just over half a year, their century-long ambitions were completely expelled from the East, forming the magnificent view of the current stage of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Churchill hastily flew to Washington to devise countermeasures with Roosevelt. As a result, Admiral Kimmel was dismissed, and the new air force commander, King, concurrently held the important posts of commander of the combined fleet and minister of war. Air force officers were successively assigned to important posts. From this, it can be inferred how much the United States values the air force.</p>
<p>The New York Times raised the issue of this military reorganization, discussing that in the future, "the United States must proceed with construction and change its organization in the order of first, long-range bombers and long-range airships, second, aircraft carriers, and third, cruisers and destroyers." Although this cannot be said to be the will of the leadership, it is not far from it. The United States has suspended the construction of 58,000-ton battleships and 25,000-ton heavy cruisers and light cruisers, and has used merchant ships to convert them into aircraft carriers, which is clear evidence. It can be seen that the United States is desperately trying to seize command of the air in the Pacific.</p>
<p>This change in the U.S. method of operation is actually a countermeasure adopted in response to the great achievements of the Japanese Air Force since the beginning of the war. Recently, the United States has begun to gradually recognize Japan's strength.</p>
<p>They have realized that their disastrous defeat was due to complacency and arrogance and are now desperately pouring their efforts into reversing the situation.</p>
<p>So, what kind of strategy do they want to use to maintain their prestige? First, they are strengthening their air force at maximum speed to recapture the strategic bases in the Pacific occupied by the Japanese army. They are also bombing the residents of the areas occupied by the Japanese army and announcing the strategy of bombing Japan to the nation through propaganda. At the same time, they are using submarine "guerrilla" warfare to disrupt trade in the Greater East Asia Sea. They are also eagerly replenishing the main fleet lost in the battles of the Aleutian Islands, Solomon Islands, Coral Sea, and Hawaii, and trying to build warships equivalent to the Japanese Combined Fleet in order to reverse the decline of the main surface fleet. Thus, Nimitz made the bold statement of "large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland," and Undersecretary of the Army Peterson made a propaganda to deceive about their defeats by saying to the nation: "Japan and the Japanese people have recently really felt the pain of war all over their bodies." The New York Times also said: "To bomb the Japanese mainland, we must first recapture Burma and strengthen the U.S. Air Force in China to establish an organized air raid plan," in order to stir up the enemy's hatred among the people of their own country. However, the American people have not yet awakened from their pleasant dreams. Shortages of supplies, conscription by the military, and low wages have caused labor disputes, and there is a very obvious state of unrest in the country.</p>
<p>Now let us examine the U.S. air raids on the mainland. The enemy is eagerly engaged in strengthening its air force and using Midway Island and Dutch Harbor as bases to bomb the Japanese mainland. But they do not know at all that the U.S. troops in the Solomon Islands have been cut off due to the Japanese Naval Air Force, and there will be a second (blank text, unreadable) defeat. Because of the fierce bombing by the Japanese Air Force, Prime Minister Curtin said sadly: "What is the United States doing? Not a single plane is coming. Should Australia surrender to Japan?" He pleaded with the United States to transport weapons, even if it was only a little help. Also, due to the recent fierce bombing by the Japanese Air Force, he complained, "The United States is using new aircraft!" In a nutshell, it is impossible for them to bomb the Japanese mainland. Because in this war, the distances for conducting large-scale air raids are very short. There is no precedent for a large formation of aircraft bombing an area more than 600 miles from its base. Of course, the development of aircraft is extremely rapid, and today's aircraft cannot be used as tomorrow's aircraft. However, the distance from Midway Island and Dutch Harbor to Tokyo is about 2,300 miles or more. A certain U.S. military commentator said, "It is quite difficult to carry out continuous bombing of areas more than 800 kilometers away. The increase in distance reduces the amount of bombs carried, which is strategically unfavorable."</p>
<p>In addition, the defense of the Japanese mainland is extremely thorough. In the north, we have first occupied Attu and Kiska Islands. In the center of the Pacific, we have occupied Wake Island and the South Seas Islands. Strong defenses have also been deployed in New Guinea, preventing the enemy from crossing the line. Moreover, Australia will soon become an abandoned child of the Pacific.</p>
<p>We should lend a helping hand to this Pacific castaway, a ring of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and adopt it as an adoptive child.</p>
<p>After the Japanese Navy occupied Timor Island, it relentlessly launched air battles centered on Port Darwin, Wyndham, and Broome in northern Australia. After New Britain and Rabaul were also occupied by Japan, Australia was completely reduced to an "orphan of the Pacific." The United States attaches great importance to this southern route of attack against Japan and is planning to strengthen its air force and engage in fierce base battles with the Japanese Air Force. Because Japan is one step ahead of the United States in terms of the quality of aircraft, Japan has command of the air in the Pacific. Therefore, enemy air forces and transport fleets often suffer heavy damage and are scattered in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>These great air battles in the South Pacific are brave, tragic, and unparalleled. Future war historians will unhesitatingly use the words "truly fierce air battles" to describe them.</p>
<p>In short, the United States is desperately strengthening its air force and spying on our southern occupied bases. As for us, we are also occupying the U.S. bases in the south, cutting off maritime traffic between the United States and Australia, and making Australia an "orphan of the Pacific."</p>
<p>On April 7, the Imperial Headquarters announced the naval battle off Florida Island. This was a fierce air battle following the naval battle off Isabel Island on February 1. Since the battle unfolded with the South Pacific as the stage, the Japanese and American forces have engaged in close-range, head-on confrontation. In the naval battle off Florida Island, after the Japanese side advanced from Buna and Guadalcanal, it effectively prevented the enemy's large transport convoy that was trying to replenish troops, weapons, and ammunition in this area, sinking two large military transport ships of more than 8,000 tons and eight ships of more than 5,000 tons. In addition, two cruisers and destroyers were also sunk. A total of 37 Grumman P-38 aircraft escorting the transport convoy were shot down.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the United States wants to transport tens of thousands of troops and many aircraft to recapture the strategic bases. An unparalleled large-scale air battle is unfolding around a tiny isolated island in the region. However, the Japanese Air Force constantly defeats the enemy. In particular, in the naval battle off Florida Island, it severely struck the enemy's counterattack attempts and sank 13 transport ships. This is enough to prove that the Japanese Air Force is becoming stronger and stronger, and the situation of complete victory is becoming more and more solid. The U.S. Navy Department announced that the United States only lost seven aircraft in this naval battle and ambiguously described the situation of defeat in order to deceive the world. Even if the United States makes the bold statement that it wants to recapture the areas occupied by the Japanese army, no matter how many aircraft the United States sends, only scattered wreckage remains in front of the Japanese elite air force. When the results of the naval battle off Florida Island are still fresh in our ears, on April 12, the Imperial Headquarters announced that between April 11 and 12, the combat bomber squadron of the Japanese Army Air Force attacked enemy ships and aircraft groups off New Guinea and Lae, sinking four transport ships and one destroyer, and shooting down more than 60 aircraft, while the Japanese side lost five aircraft.</p>
<p>Also, recently on the 23rd, in the Aleutian Islands, cruisers and destroyers were sunk, and the Japanese Air Force gained an overall advantage.</p>
<p>B. Commerce Raiding Warfare: Next, how about the U.S. boasting of using submarines for "guerrilla warfare"? If the operation is examined in detail, this submarine "guerrilla warfare"</p>
<p>Continued on Sixth Edition</p>
<h3>The Elite Combined Fleet of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>"A nation that does not understand the sea will never prosper." "The center of the future world is in the Pacific." This is indeed a profound and truthful statement. Only a nation that knows the Pacific and controls the Pacific is a nation that will lead humanity in the future. Our East Asian people have this massive fleet and do not have to worry about not controlling the Pacific. All the nations of Asia will surely succeed.</p>
<h3>Certain Victory in Battle, Certain Success in Attack: The Japanese Navy is Truly Invincible - The Giant Guns of the Invincible Fleet</h3>
<p>Countless fleets once mobilized, causing the enemy nations of Britain and America to be terrified; a single giant shell could transform the course of history.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Translated from the Fifth Factory</p>
<p>Even so, it has not become the counter-offensive weapon that the United States boasts of. Submarines, due to their nature, cannot have long endurance. It is also impossible for a submarine's hull to be completely submerged at the bottom of the sea; only a fraction of the entire submarine can be submerged. Especially the American submarines, which lack both sufficient numbers and adequate technology, are not a match for Japanese submarines.</p>
<p>Currently, all over the world, the commerce raiding war is intensifying. British Prime Minister Churchill, who for 150 years has boasted of dominating the world's seven seas, is flying by plane to either the Soviet Union or America, rushing back and forth, pleading for assistance. On one hand, the number of ships sunk by German submarines exceeds the shipbuilding capacity of Britain and America combined. On the other hand, in the Pacific, Japanese submarines are appearing off California, constantly sinking armed merchant ships along the American coast, while Roosevelt is concealing continuous defeats from the public and fantasizing about victory. On May 23rd, they heavily damaged American battleships and cruisers in the Aleutian Islands, moving horizontally and vertically, echoing each other from east to west, advancing towards sinking ships at sea.</p>
<p>This is completely different from the inhumane act of the United States attacking hospital ships.</p>
<p>However, regarding the character of this commerce raiding war, the modern naval historian, Admiral Mahan, described it as follows:</p>
<p>"When the enemy's commerce is thoroughly destroyed by a commerce raiding war, the enemy can be forced into the abyss of poverty. Therefore, this type of operation will play a very important role in future wars, but from the perspective of naval warfare, it is only a secondary operation. If one elevates commerce raiding to the first position in naval warfare, believing that commerce raiding can destroy the enemy, that is a great delusion."</p>
<p>However, this is not completely separate from naval operations; it has an inseparable complementary relationship with naval power. When in an inferior position to the enemy's naval forces, this is the only method. If in a superior position, of course it can be even more remarkable if this method of operation is used in conjunction.</p>
<p>In the pre-war London Conference, the United States, from a position of justice and humanity, advocated the complete abolition of submarines. And in the previous Great War, due to Germany's unrestricted sinking of merchant ships, disregarding humanity, it declared war on Germany. But now it has repeatedly used submarines to attack hospital ships. This is truly an uncivilized act that violates international law, exposing the barbarity of the Anglo-Saxons. The submarine commander who attacked the hospital ship foolishly thought he would gain merit, but instead aroused the enemy's animosity in the front lines and rear, creating the opposite effect. He has made it so that even kneeling before the statue of Lincoln, who sang praises of justice, humanity, and liberating black people, he cannot escape his guilt.</p>
<p>The enemy's attempt to suppress Japan with the so-called ABCD encirclement has been driven away beyond India, the Aleutians, and the Solomon Islands by the Japanese elite forces, but we must never be complacent about this.</p>
<p>The areas from the Aleutians, Midway Island, and the Solomon Islands onward are still within the enemy's sphere of influence. The four hundred million people of Australia's Eastern races are still being exploited by the enemy, so we still have the obligation to liberate these East Asian peoples. In addition to planning battles in the South Pacific, the enemy is further instigating Chiang Kai-shek, using him to try to retake Burma without mobilizing his own forces.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the Indian Ocean. It has been a year since the Japanese naval forces annihilated the British Indian Ocean Fleet. They are gradually strengthening strategic bases. They illegally occupied French territories such as Madagascar, Comoro, and Réunion without prior notice.</p>
<p>The world's famous scholars of international law are nurtured in Britain, yet Britain is now committing such acts that are impermissible under international law, truly revealing its complex nature. Even if Britain engages in unlawful acts not permitted under international law, the British before the steel wheels and iron armor-like deployment in Japanese Burma, Andaman, and East Indies can only eagerly retreat to the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>(4) Japan's Inevitable Victory</p>
<p>The above explained that the integrated air supremacy, sea control, and ground control operations in modern warfare are the key to victory in this naval war. Although Britain and America are loudly proclaiming a counter-offensive operation against Japan, Japan will not fail in any of these three aspects. War is when a country fights with its total strength, so in addition to the above military warfare, material resources and human resources, namely the three Ms (Military, Money, Men), are undoubtedly necessary factors. As for human resources, East Asia has a total of one billion, and Japan has one hundred million; there is no need to elaborate on this situation. As for material resources, newspapers in various countries are saying that this year—1943—is the year of decisive battle. If this is true, then Japan's victory is already beyond doubt. However, enemy news or communications use astronomical figures to publish or report the shipbuilding plans and aircraft and tank production figures that the United States boasts of, deceiving themselves in a fog, saying that victory lies with Britain and America.</p>
<p>However, these people have completely failed to recognize the great war results achieved by the Japanese Army and Navy, which have placed Japan in an invincible and impregnable position. Unless the greatest miracle occurs in the world, the spiritual strength and skills of the American Army and Navy cannot reach a state of surpassing Japan. Therefore, to destroy the Japanese Navy, recover the war results that Japan has achieved to date, recover lost territory, and make Japan submit is ultimately unnecessary to consider. Let us briefly describe the reasons.</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt returned home from Casa-Blanca, the first thing he said was that the US Army's troop strength should be increased to 7.5 million. Today, transporting one soldier requires at least eighteen tons of ship capacity. Therefore, transporting 100,000 soldiers requires at least 1.8 million tons of ship capacity. Assuming that the average tonnage of a ship is 15,000 tons, then the transport ships for transporting 100,000 soldiers will require 120 ships. It is not considered possible for this transport fleet, protected by cruisers and destroyers, to enter and exit the sea controlled by Japan's air and sea power. Because the Japanese ships and aircraft searching and guarding in that area, as long as they send a single telegram, the Japanese fleet waiting in position can immediately sink them. From this perspective, no matter how much the US Army increases, and no matter how large its army boasts of being, there is no need to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Then, we only need to do some research on the US Navy. Roosevelt once discussed a general counter-offensive against Japan, gradually retaking the Japanese-occupied bases from the southern invasion route and the northern invasion route. However, the many islands scattered like stars in this area have been used by Japan as unsinkable aircraft carriers to spy on the American mainland. Therefore, even if the United States wants to attack with large aircraft carriers, the unsinkable aircraft carriers will immediately sink the sinkable aircraft carriers. As for wanting to bomb the Japanese mainland from the center of the Pacific, the various vanguard islands of the Japanese mainland are not so easily approached by the US fleet. Therefore, the path that the United States most wants to use for attack is the northern Aleutian and southern Solomon areas, not choosing the centrally advancing route that is most difficult in navigation. Taking a step back, let us look at observations that are extremely favorable to the United States: their planned counter-offensive is not limited to propaganda like the Chongqing army. Assuming their plan succeeds, they will make a comeback in two or three years, and even take back the Japanese-occupied territories. In that case, the words of the famous German strategist General Moltke and the trickster Napoleon have already clearly provided a solution.</p>
<p>General Moltke said:</p>
<p>"Combat power is like a river channel. The closer to the source, the stronger it is. No matter how much military strength there is, its pressure gradually decreases when acting over long distances. To forget this fact and wage war is a fool's strategy."</p>
<p>Tactics King Napoleon said:</p>
<p>"The difficulty of combat is inversely proportional to distance. With equal forces, when fighting based on the length of distance, the closer one is at an advantage."</p>
<p>The words of these two strategic and tactical masters are axioms in war. As long as the Japanese Navy is healthy, no matter how hard Britain and America try to recover lost territory and make Japan submit, it will ultimately be a dream.</p>
<p>Now let's try to draw a circle with a diameter of 4,000 kilometers, centered on Cape Eluanbi at the southern tip of Taiwan: the trajectory of this large arc extends west from the Andaman Islands through the entire territory of Burma, south from the Greater Sunda Lesser Sunda Islands through Tiqeung Islands, passing through New Guinea in a week, and east to the Hawaiian Islands. The central part contains the Philippines and Malaysia. In the area within this large arc, the military power of the Japanese Navy is steadily carrying out construction.</p>
<p>To be a victor in modern warfare, the prerequisite is to first obtain the most important sectors of war materials: iron, oil, coal, rubber, tungsten, and daily necessities such as rice, sugar, and salt are absolutely necessary. These things are the world's treasures on the land within this arc, and the amount that is produced is the greatest. Therefore, after Britain and America lost this treasure trove, their war resources became increasingly scarce and have all fallen into the hands of Japan. Even if this Greater East Asia War lasts for decades in the future, it will not fail due to a lack of materials.</p>
<p>The United States, once known as the world's number one industrial country and resource country, became the world's number one by obtaining resources from these lands, and Britain maintained its world navy with this. One year after they lost these places, Britain already felt the shortage of materials, and in the United States, due to the lack of tungsten, rubber, sugar, etc., the state of insufficient production of military supplies was extremely profound. In addition, the labor of Laoren's work, Roosevelt, and the White House officials are considering that the number of Japanese to return home to study and many others agreed to resolve labor disputes, said "Japan is a strong country, the people do not underestimate the strength of Japan." So in the future, the lack of material resources will not be able to become an arsenal for the anti-Axis countries, and will not provide weapons assistance. The United States is now providing some old-fashioned weapons to the impoverished Chongqing and Australia to preserve the United States' awe and prevent them from withdrawing from the Allied front. The country that once "had" has turned into a country that "has not." Therefore, Britain and America are naturally extremely afraid of the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and sincerely cannot place any more sympathy on its future. And Japan is now self-sufficient and worry-free.</p>
<p>Among the world's great powers, there is no country as difficult to attack and easy to defend as Japan. Therefore, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels' statement "Japan is difficult to attack and will not fall" is an appropriate remark.</p>
<p>(5) Alas, Marshal Yamamoto!</p>
<p>We, no, the people of the whole world, have encountered an extremely major change and are saddened by it. After one or two days, this shock turned into admiration, this sadness turned into gratitude. This major event of the century is the death in battle of Marshal Yamamoto. The faith and hope of Japan's 100 million people are focused on one point: "With Yamamoto in the Navy, the country will be as safe as Mount Tai." But General Yamamoto suddenly embarked on the journey to the Yellow Springs.</p>
<p>Looking back, since assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet three years ago, the illustrious war results achieved in the Greater East Asia War have entirely stemmed from General Yamamoto's strategic planning.</p>
<p>Marshal Togo, the saint of the sea in the Russo-Japanese War, became a god at the age of eighty-eight, living out his full life. Everyone in the world knew of his death and expressed their condolences.</p>
<p>Now we have lost the second saint general, and the Japanese people's mourning for this Marshal Togo is even greater. People around the world also unhesitatingly praised the death of the marshal, who was both a military commander and the founder of the flying corps, in an aircraft. But once one is a military commander and active on the battlefield, the awareness of dying in battle is, needless to say, a matter of course. To die in battle as a military commander is the highest honor.</p>
<p>Marshal Yamamoto's death gave the Japanese people great sorrow. The marshal's death has no impact on naval combat power. Before Yamamoto, there may not have been a general like Marshal Yamamoto, but after Marshal Yamamoto, there are countless Marshal Yamamotos.</p>
<p>Therefore, Marshal Yamamoto's death has aroused the infinite enemy animosity of the 100 million people and the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet, boosting infinite morale.</p>
<p>Old and young, men and women, all follow in the footsteps of Marshal Yamamoto, forming a total force of 100 million, no, 1 billion, until the day we achieve a victory that cannot but be won. (Translated by Xiang)</p>

<p>Chairman (Wu): During the 38th Naval Memorial Period of our friendly nation, our agency is holding this "Symposium" on Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation, which is of great significance. Looking back, during the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy, in one fell swoop, annihilated Imperial Russia's Baltic Fleet, destroyed the strength of the Eastern Fleet of Imperial Russia that was invading East Asia, and shattered Imperial Russia's ambition to covet East Asia. This war was the starting point for our friendly nation Japan to shoulder the responsibility of defending East Asia, and it occupies the most glorious page in the history of defending East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese Navy Memorial Day is not only the glory of our friendly nation, but we, standing on the position of the East Asian nation, also feel excited and happy. After the Russo-Japanese War, the friendly nation Japan Navy trained and researched day and night, constantly seeking strengthening in quantity, superiority in quality, and tempering in spirit. Therefore, on the day the Greater East Asia War broke out, it inflicted enormous damage on the US Pacific outpost, the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii. Within a few days of the start of the war, it sank two British East Asian Fleet capital ships, HMS Prince of Wales, and then, in a very short period, successively occupied the bases of British and American aggression in East Asia, establishing the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After several battles in the Solomon Islands, it eliminated most of the British and American naval forces counterattacking East Asia, thereby laying the foundation for the final victory of the East Asia War. The Chinese Navy began construction in the late Qing Dynasty. Under the shackles of unequal treaties, the fences were exhausted, and there was no naval defense to speak of. After the National Government moved its capital, in order to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia, we began with the basic work of training people for the construction of the new Chinese Navy, and achieved expected progress. At this time when British and American aggressive labor are driven out of East Asia, building a new Chinese Navy should make every effort to achieve success on the current situation, but in terms of technology, there are many aspects that depend on the assistance of our friendly nation. Protecting East Asia is the common mission of China and Japan. Our agency is holding this symposium with profound significance in protecting East Asia, hoping that you will express your opinions on the several issues we have proposed above. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Kamata to give a high-level speech on "The Significance of the Naval Battle of the Russo-Japanese War for the Defense of East Asia."</p>
<p>Kamada: The rise and fall of countries in the world are mostly determined by the size of their naval forces. I remember more than 30 years ago, when the President of the United States was also called Roosevelt, he said: "Whether the United States can be strong depends on whether the United States can control the Pacific Ocean." This shows their ambition and they have long felt the importance of the navy. The United Kingdom has colonies all over the world. It has tried its best to balance the powers of various countries in Europe, so that it can manipulate various countries to permanently maintain and expand its colonial opportunities, especially its ambition for the East, which is even stronger. It made India a colony, and Hong Kong as a base for further aggression in the East. Other countries such as Germany, Italy, France, and the Soviet Union are also very concerned about the Pacific Ocean, especially the Soviet Union's Far East policy, which began in the era of Imperial Russia. Because of its relations with Germany, France, etc. in the West, it could not expand. Therefore, Imperial Russia has always attacked the East and signed secret treaties with the Manchu Qing government, and even sent troops to the Chishima Islands and other places behind Japan to expand its power. Various countries also began to attack the East at the same time, demanding that China open its doors. However, we must think that the President of the United States once said: "America is America for Americans." Then we should also say: "Asia is Asia for Asians." However, Asia at that time had not yet realized the aggression of Europe and the United States. They thought that Europe and the United States were helping them and that Europe and the United States were advanced countries. They thought that they could not resist and gave up on themselves, making a big mistake and enduring the aggression of Europe and the United States. Humans were originally on land, and their relationship with water is shallower. However, Japan's territory is surrounded by the sea, so its relationship with water is very deep, and the place is small. At the same time, because of the ambitious ambitions of various countries, Japan had long realized the aggression of various countries. In the era of the shogunate, there was a "colonial policy" in place and Japan did not interact with foreign countries, so that in the Meiji era, the people of Japan did not understand various countries very well. Emperor Meiji said, "Japan must absorb the culture of the great powers." But in this way, Japan absorbed the Japanese spirit on the one hand and the culture and knowledge of the great powers on the other, and began to build the Japanese Navy. The Japanese Navy was established in the Meiji 5th year (1872), 71 years ago from now. In the Sino-Japanese War, it obtained the Far Eastern Peninsula. At first, the United Kingdom and the United States were all for their own benefit and wanted Japan to return it to China. Japan returned it immediately because it was unable to deal with various countries, but Russia borrowed Lushun and Dalian from the Manchu Qing government not long after Japan returned it. Japan was stimulated by this and vigorously built the navy. Emperor Meiji paid great attention to the expansion of the navy, and gave half salary to all civil servants to use as "navy construction funds." The people also responded and supported it. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had 6 battleships, 18 medium cruisers, 19 destroyers, and 76 torpedo boats, totaling 264,684 tons. During the Sino-Japanese War, it had only 26,274 tons, a great improvement in ten years. The Russo-Japanese War began in February of the Meiji 37th year. Russia strengthened its military power in the Far East Peninsula. Japan negotiated for their troops to withdraw. Since August of the Meiji 36th year, Japan has been trying to resolve the matter peacefully through diplomatic means. However, the Russian side not only did not respond, but also advanced its troops. Therefore, this "Russo-Japanese negotiation" lasted for six months without any results. After the war began, the Russian Navy attempted to cut off the Japanese land and naval forces in Manchuria and transferred the "Baltic Fleet" to the east. The fleet had 8 battleships, 9 cruisers, 3 coastal defense ships, and 9 destroyers to attack Japan. On May 27th, the sacred Navy Memorial Day, the Japanese completely destroyed the Russian fleet. At that time, public opinion in various countries in the world recognized that Japan could defeat Russia. The Shen Bao editorial also expressed its joy at Japan's defeat of Russia. Later, India also realized that if Asians could rise up, they could resist the aggression of Europe and the United States, thus causing an anti-British and American movement in India. Therefore, it is said that the naval battle was the beginning of the "dawn of Asia." It is a pity that Japan did not join hands with the Asians at that time to deal with Europe and the United States. I think that Asians will one day be able to join hands to drive out Britain and the United States and achieve the great goal of "Asia is for Asians."</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Principal Jiang Xiyuan to talk about "Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation Issues."</p>
<p>Jiang: Sino-Japanese naval cooperation has been going on for three years since the National Government returned its capital. In fact, our new navy is very young, and we are very ashamed to cooperate with the powerful Japanese Navy, but we are already striving to improve. The new navy has now begun to be created, but materials are still lacking and manufacturing is small, but the new navy's new spirit has cooperated with the Japanese army. As long as there is a spiritual and volitional cooperation, the new navy should be able to be reformed. And we must go to full strength cooperation, and do not regret "having the will but lacking the power." The only focus of building a new navy is to have definite cooperation, and at the same time, in the cooperation, we must understand the shortcomings of the Chinese Navy, that is, the soldiers have grievances that they cannot express. Whether it is in society or at home, they all have pain in their hearts and should be understood. At that time, the friendship between the new Chinese Navy and the friendly nation's Navy must be sincere. Do not misunderstand because of differences in habits, etc. Know that cooperation with sincerity can achieve a satisfactory goal.</p>
<p>The general Chinese people have a very deep "continental concept" and a very shallow "maritime concept," but in today's Sino-Japanese cooperation, naval cooperation has more hope than any other cooperation. I also hope that the friendly nation will come to help, so that Chinese nationals who do not have a naval concept will also develop an interest in the ocean and understand the importance of the navy. And we should ask for thorough cooperation in both spirit and material. In the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, naval cooperation is the most important. Therefore, naval cooperation is now the entire problem of Greater East Asia. In the past, the Chinese national spirit has had many national heroes, and our friendly nation has also had many great achievements, which are the same. This Greater East Asia War is the development of the cooperative spirit between China and Japan, but the Chinese Navy is difficult to promote due to the environment, and it still relies on the guidance of our friendly nation, and we should also strive to work hard ourselves. In the 38 years since the Russo-Japanese War, the friendly nation's Navy has been actively preparing every day. Therefore, the martyrdom of Admiral Yamamoto, whose ocean is the East Asian people, can represent the East Asian spirit. We were very saddened to learn the news. Especially the two countries' navies have learned their lessons. The future of cooperation between China and Japan is even more magnificent and bright. We can better promote the essence of cooperation between the two countries. As for the fact that habits can be improved with each other, the Chinese Navy has a new life. We already have a good environment and a strong will. If we work hard to develop cooperation with our friendly nation, I believe the future is bright and splendid.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Director Ye Kesong to give a high-level speech on "Building a New Chinese Navy and Defending East Asia."</p>
<p>Ye: "A nation must first have a 'central idea' before it can be united in one mind and move forward towards the 'central idea' to achieve successful construction. The 'central idea' of the new Chinese Navy is 'reviving China and defending East Asia' under the guidance of Chairman Wang [Jingwei]." Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly nation has completely driven out the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia for a hundred years. During this period, the government has also resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. Our new Navy should also "fight side by side" with the Japanese Navy, but in fact, the construction of the new Navy is still in its infancy and cannot fight side by side with the Japanese army. Therefore, our country must first have the spirit of building a new Navy. With this spirit, we can promote our existing strength, ensure social security, strengthen the power of the National Government, and make the people have a knowledge and belief in the new Navy and enthusiastically support it, so that the new Navy can be strong and take on part of the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, please ask Captain Tang Baohuang to give us his opinion on "How to Build a New Chinese Navy."</p>
<p>Tang: It is not easy to build a new Chinese Navy, but no matter what country it is, it must have a strong navy to make its national power strong. However, the first thing to build a navy is spirit, and the second is money. In addition to these two key points, we also need talent. This is also the only prerequisite. With money, we can manufacture a large number of warships. To manufacture warships, we must first set up factories. China's naval construction has felt very difficult for months. Not to mention warships of several thousands or tens of thousands of tons, even warships of several hundred tons are not easy. But we know that we must struggle hard to build, from small factories to large factories, and gradually seek progress. We also need to make the people realize the importance of the current naval construction, pay attention to it, and the whole country can work together to build, so that the new Chinese Navy can be strong, cooperate with our friendly nation, and defend East Asia.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Director Kamata of the Press Department to express his opinion on "Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation."</p>
<p>Kamada: People in your country often express something like this: "China is vast and rich in resources, and there are many people and soldiers. The Japanese Navy is world-famous. As long as China is responsible for the army and Japan is responsible for the navy, it is enough to cooperate to defend East Asia." However, the Japanese believe that the ocean is very important. It is best to make the Chinese people not know the importance of the ocean and not want the Chinese Navy to expand, because expansion has a considerable impact on Japan. This is the idea of some Japanese people. This idea seems to have its own reasons, but it is actually very misunderstood. We must know that looking at the map, only the cooperation between the two countries of Greater East Asia can protect East Asia and win victory. At the same time, the division of labor and cooperation that the Chinese think is also absolutely unreasonable. We can verify the facts. The United Kingdom does this to its colonies. For example, in India, it is only allowed to grow cotton, and Myanmar is called rice, etc. It is not allowed to produce a variety of materials in the same place. This kind of division of labor and cooperation is the policy of the British colonies, and Sino-Japanese cooperation must not work. However, we must also say that the United Kingdom's colonial policy is correct in peacetime, but once an accident occurs, there will also be problems. If India and Myanmar become independent, the United Kingdom's rice will also become a problem. For Sino-Japanese naval cooperation, we hope that China must have a strong navy, and even that the army and air force cooperate with Japan. This is the Japanese spirit, but the construction of the navy must have a considerable period. Japan already has a history of 71 years. Under the cooperation of officials and civilians, I hope that China will only need to cooperate with officials and civilians, work hard to build, and revitalize the spirit of building a new navy, work hard to move forward, and can achieve success.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, let's ask Principal Jiang to talk about "The Current State of the Construction of the New Chinese Navy."</p>
<p>Jiang: The key point of naval construction now is to cultivate talent first. The Central Naval Academy is responsible for this obligation. There are already 5,000 students, of whom 2,000 have already graduated, and 3,000 are still training in school. In addition to educating students, our school also has a senior non-commissioned officer training class, which is now in its third term, and we gather and educate all the Chinese Navy. Regarding the education of sailors, there are now three sailor training centers, the first in Shanghai, the second in Guangzhou, and the third in Weihaiwei. The sailor training centers handle practice education. For higher education, we still need the Shanghai Central Naval Academy. The above is a general overview of naval training. As for the Naval Defense Command, the first is in the capital Nanjing. It has been established for three years since the capital was returned. The second is in Guangzhou, which is the former Guangdong River Defense Command, now renamed Guangzhou Defense Command. The third is in Weihaiwei, also named Weihaiwei Defense Command. At the same time, we are about to establish the Hankou Naval Base Force, which is also the prototype of the Defense Command. They all have considerable gunboats and other equipment. Some are exported, and some are responsible for defense tasks in the interior. The base force is responsible for security work. There is also the Hydrographic Bureau, which is responsible for the national hydrographic survey tasks. Since Director Ye's command and defense, it has achieved considerable results. The scale of the national defense navy has been established, and the internal structure has a system. Under the unified command of the Navy Department, cooperation with the friendly nation's navy and spiritual construction are progressing day by day. In other words, various materials have gradually been provided by the friendly nation and are becoming more abundant.</p>
<p>Chairman: Now, please ask Director Kamata to talk about "The Current State and Future of British, American, and Japanese Naval Labor in the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Kamada: Since the Greater East Asia War completely drove British and American forces out of East Asia, their predetermined goals have all been broken. Before the Greater East Asia War, the British and American sides maintained a "5:5:3" strength. At the beginning of the war, the American naval strength was 17 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 37 cruisers, 166 destroyers, and 108 submarines, but the United States believed that its strength across the Pacific Ocean was not enough and had to add twice the strength to achieve its goal. Therefore, it is still vigorously manufacturing various warships, etc. The British side has 15 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 70 cruisers, 206 destroyers, and 43 submarines. In addition to possessing commercial labor, the United States is still building. If it does not fight against Germany and the Greater East Asia War, it is estimated that by March of this year, it could be called the world's No. 1 naval power. Regarding Japan's strength, it could originally be matched, but because it is in the war, the number of warships, etc., cannot be reported, please forgive me. At the London Naval Conference nine years ago, Admiral Yamamoto proposed to abolish the naval disarmament treaty. After that, unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, followed by the war with Britain and the United States, but Japan is still working hard to build warships, but the numbers cannot be told. Japan once held a prize for naval slogans. The winning slogan was "For 5:5:3, Daily Gold." This means that 5:5:3 is the ratio estimated by the United Kingdom and the United States compared to Japan's efforts. Together, "Daily Gold" is the work of the Japanese naval personnel, with only Sunday and Saturday as rest days. However, naval personnel should fight hard and build in the process from Monday to Friday every day. The implication is very deep. In other words, it is to take out the spirit of Japan to fight hard. The spirit of Japan's training of soldiers is also the same. Japan pays attention to the ratio of "5:5:3" and always wants to defeat the unbalanced power. Therefore, this Greater East Asia War gave the enemy a great blow. At this time, Japan adopted the strategy of evenly dividing the enemy's power before fighting hard. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, it gave the enemy a great blow, and now it has reversed the power of 5:5:3. The sinking of the Prince of Wales, etc., can be proof. The naval power of Britain and the United States is no longer as good as the efforts of the Japanese Navy. However, now that aircraft are very developed, the navy focuses on warships, but now we must also consider aircraft. Some take off from bases, but most take off from aircraft carriers, so aircraft carriers are very important. Before the Greater East Asia War, the United Kingdom had six, almost all of which have been destroyed. Although they are still publicizing a lot, it is speculated that unless other ships are rebuilt or manufactured, all of the previous ones are gone. However, many of the warships sunk by Germany and Italy in the United Kingdom were sunk, and many were damaged. Moreover, the bombing of aircraft in the sky affected the factories, which is beyond consideration. So, the construction has been greatly hit. The United States is still building various warships, etc., but we cannot underestimate the enemy, because underestimating the other side is easy to fail, but the numbers they advertise cannot be believed, because manufacturing is not easy, and the losses after the war cannot be completely compensated. It is difficult for the United States to make every effort to produce and counterattack. Speaking of the future, the difference in labor between Britain and the United States is very large. The United States will definitely be dominant, so we think that the future of Britain is very pitiful. The United States is advertising in the newspapers that it produces a lot of munitions, but the inventory of materials has been exhausted. Although their factories are working hard day and night, their ability is weak. The ratio of the number of people injured or killed in the factory is, according to statistics, 40 times more than on the battlefield, so it is showing a backward phenomenon. Japan was actually short of materials in the past, but now it has obtained very rich materials in the south and is developing materials, so from now on, there will only be development and no backwardness, and it can gain a must-win position. Finally, regarding the death of Admiral Yamamoto, some people think that the death of the admiral may be very unfavorable, but the navy is different from the army. The marshal of the navy commands on the flagship and stands on the highest command platform to command the battle. The death of General Yamamoto was an unfortunate martyrdom while fighting or inspecting on the plane, and we are very saddened, but the soldiers will fight even harder and continue the admiral's will to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Chairman: Thank you all for giving very valuable opinions and providing very valuable materials one after another. This meeting has added a lot of color, and I am sincerely grateful for your teachings. Finally, please ask Mr. Yang Huilang to summarize the opinions of all parties and make a conclusion.</p>
<p>Yang: The issue of Sino-Japanese naval cooperation is worth discussing in the Greater East Asia War. Japan is a powerful country in the Far East, and it has become a world naval power since the Meiji Restoration. A hundred years ago, East Asia had a great crisis: (1) The British naval forces invaded Asia, (2) The American naval forces entered the Pacific Ocean, (3) The Russian naval forces surrounded the Manchurian area. After the Japanese Restoration, the result of the Russo-Japanese War defeated Russia. Therefore, the Russo-Japanese War was the starting point for defending the Greater East Asia War, but to thoroughly defend East Asia, it is necessary to build a new Chinese Navy. Since the National Government's war on wheat, the construction of the navy has been progressing day by day. For example, in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Weihaiwei, Nanjing, and even Hankou, there are naval officers and sailors training and the establishment of important port commands. Although building a strong navy is not easy, (1) the friendly nation Japan sincerely assists China in completing the construction of the navy, and (2) China is vast and rich in resources and has a large population. It is important to build an army. It is also necessary to build a navy. As long as there is the determination and courage to build a navy, the future is promising. Speaking of the comparison of the naval forces of Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, before the naval disarmament conference, the construction of the Japanese Navy was surrounded by the 5:5:3 ratio of Britain, the United States, and Japan. However, since Japan withdrew from the naval disarmament conference until after the Greater East Asia War, Japan has annihilated the British and American navies. Now, the comparison of the actual strength of the British, American, and Japanese navies has become a ratio of 5:5:7. This is the glory of the Japanese Navy and also the glory of Greater East Asia. As for Sino-Japanese naval cooperation, the Chinese Navy must be built up and become strong enough to be worthy of being friends with the Japanese Navy in order to be able to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>
