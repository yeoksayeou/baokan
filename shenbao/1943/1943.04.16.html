<p>社評</p>
<h3>我們現在只看見「捉了小魚」</h3>
<p>自從大東亞戰事發生以後，一般投機者因無從再做外匯黑市的買賣，於是紛紛轉移其目標於囤積日用品之一途·紗·布·燭·皂·香烟·西藥·均爲投機者所收買之對象，其中以紗布係大宗貨品，尤爲投機者所最樂爲。雖然上海是紗布的製造中心；且擁有足數華中十年乃至下五年消費的大量棉製品；可是紗布價格却日漲無已。最近兩三月中漲勢之猛，尤堪驚人。如以陰曆年初；開盤時的廿支紗價爲標準，則目前紗價已達當時百分之三百以上。誰也不能否認這不是投機囤積的影響，誰也不能不切齒於這般投機者的行爲！</p>
<p>在國府澈查囤積投機的命令公佈以後，社會一般心理，一方面固然歌頌政府賢明；一方面也未旨不擔心着政府或終不能澈底查辦。蓋令而不查，查而不辦，辦而不澈底，均不免使人民對於政府减少信仰。其後，負澈查重任的財决陳之碩，實决袁愈佺，全國商業統制總會監理官陳允文，相繼來滬，會同滬市府秘書長趙尊嶽實行澈查工作。我們輿論界鑒於國府命令之嚴厲，深知投機者的背景決不單純，一致聲援，多方鼓勵，勉以上海數百萬中外市民之公論，作爲奉命查辦人員的後盾。我們深恐「虎頭蛇尾」，將使投機者的毒燄益張，民生疾苦益烈、同時，也將被友邦人士的輕視竊笑與齒冷。</p>
<p>此次國府所指派之查辦人員，在政府均有相當之地位，我們深信必能小辱政府的使命，同時也不致使人民失望。可是，國府根據澈查人員之報吿後，於十三日發表命令謂，……其他澈查未了事宜，着由主管部繼續進行，務使奸商知所歛跡，物價得以趨平」。以及十四日南京電主持澈查的陳袁二次長談話，「此次工作業已吿一段落，……惟囤積奸商或不止此，本人等雖巳返京，而調查工作仍繼續進行」。則四位大員的澈查任務，已經吿一段落，祇有「未了事宜」，「囤積奸商，或不止此」，由主管部繼續進行調查而已。</p>
<p>我們對於此次的澈查案已經不厭辭　，一再的痛切申論，無論從那一方面說，自問已經言盡於此。可是到目前爲止，所得到的反響，不過如斯，我們實覺聲嘶力竭了。諺云「從善如流」，「俯順輿情」，木來是相對的說法，而不是絕對的；如果根本一熟視無睹」，簡直無託可說了。</p>
<p>不過，我們始終認爲政府如果漠視民生，而能改善政治，是決計不可能的。而投機囤積，爲當前最害民生的政治大敵，此而可忍，孰不可忍。我們始終愛護政府，同時更愛護民生，在這種情緒之下，今天特再致其誠摯的諍言。</p>
<p>如將此次國府明令所指出查有實據之公司銀行個人等，試執上海全市民而問之曰，「識得吾」？答曰「不識」者，恐佔百分之九十九，此則所謂「小魚」也。以這樣不知名之公司，個人，謂爲大規模囤積而有操縱全市塲蠹害全社會者，雖至愚必不置信，則其慕後必有大力者之指使，及必有十百倍於此而眞正擾亂市塲蠹害社會者在。社會上傳說紛紜，已爲公開之秘密，是則國府明令中指出之公司銀行等，大量囤積貨物，擾亂市塲，固有應得之罪，但其他投機囤積更甚於此者，仍得逍遙法外，則國家之法紀何在？難道政府就寗願姑息縱容，爲保全少數違法份子，以失去全國的人心麽？近來有個政治上的不良例子，即去冬重慶政權稅治下的滇緬路運輸舞弊案件的發生，孔祥熙何嘗不以爲殺一林世良，便可减少輿論的正義呼聲，挽回社會的心理。但是輿論的鞭策，初不因此緩相，社會的心理，亦不因此轉變。社會和與論所要求的是林世良罪有應得，而對於林世良發蹤指使者，更應以大義減親的公芷態度，同樣處置。</p>
<p>最後我們對於此次澈查囤積案，謹提出質詢三點，請求政府及澈查人員的滿意答覆，以釋羣疑羣疑：</p>
<p>（一）國府明令中指出查有投機實據之公司銀行的原有資本若干，其運用於投機囤積的資金有若干，該項資金從何而來？</p>
<p>（二）兩商行的大股東，及重要董監，爲何許人，有無政府人員參加其間？</p>
<p>（三）如果認爲該兩商行的分子，均爲純商人中的「奸商」，那末，此外政府有關人員是否絕對無一從事於投機囤積，我們固然不希望公務人員有投機囤積行爲，如果事實確有，而不予檢舉澈查，故意迴護掩飾，那末，我們認爲這次政府明令澈查，是絕對的失敗。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>期待於國府的勇氣</h3>
<p>國民政府於十三日發表命令，略謂上海振華公司有囤積重要物資，擾亂市塲之實據，該公司負責人物解法院嚴辦，阜通銀行涉有重大嫌疑，着即停業，派員澈查。可見國府已在實行懲辦投機份子，吾人對於國府的勇氣和實行，衷心贊佩。華方民衆對此項政策的成行，也深切關心，所以國府是否能貫澈旣定方針，有關乎今後民衆對國府的信仰心。</p>
<p>取締囤積，當然是安定民生，健全經濟的辦法，同時因爲日本的推進對華政策，這也是國府在迫義責任上所義不容辭的必然措施。日本的推進對華政策，不用說得，在求造成國府有名符其實的中央政府的實質，俾得獨力維持國內治安。今日投機所造成的擾亂經濟界，實屬罪大惡極，不亞於遊匪的擾亂地方，假使國府地方經着手的澈查投機半途而廢，這不但民衆大失所望，而且使不顧一切犧牲來協助國府自强的日本大失所望。由於這種意味，那末實行取締投機這件工作，不但是中國國內的問題，且可謂是國府對於日本負的道義上責任。</p>
<p>檢舉振華公司，不過是國府爲安定民生的初試其錄，今後還要運用更嚴厲，更澈底的辦法，方能有充分的效果。如果一度開始的取締，因爲什麼關係而半途上葦草了事，那末其毒害甚於不取締。上决國府僅僅發表了一道澈查囤積投機的命令，上海財界就受了相當衝動，現在更進一步而着手實行，使投機份子惴惴惶恐。問題在於國府今後能否破除實際的何種因緣而根絕投機囤積。囤積投機橫行固然不幸，可是國府倒可以趁此機會表示其公正嚴格，勇氣的機會，願國府當局者起來奮發吧！（雲鵬：譯自四月十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>王蔭泰談　華北食糧問題</h3>
<p>北京十五日中央社電　華北實業督辦王蔭泰氏、此次代表政委會參加國府還都三周年紀念慶典、並與華中關係方面就調整華北經濟、華中食糧輸柱華北、及其他問題、進行折衝、茲已任務終了、返抵此間、特於十五日招待記者團、說明當前食糧物價問題、大意謂（一）關於本年度華北食糧，關係方面、正力謀由滿洲蒙疆方面運入、此决又商妥由華中供給相當數量之麵粉、故本年可由各方面運入大批食糧、且數量亦較客歲爲多、供應當可圓滑、價格亦可安定、（二）於戰時下一切均須實施統制、當局前曾設立物資物價管理委員會、及食糧管理局、着手統制、今後願民衆多加協助、俾能强化並擴充統制工作、（三）國府近已成立全國商業統制總會、故華北亦應設立統制交易之分機關、關於此舉、巳命有關方面着手計劃、於最近期間、當可成立、至糧食之配給、决定委託商人收買、然後交由糧食管理局方面實行配給、</p>
<h3>華北施政現狀（二）　確立治安並完成參戰體制</h3>
<p>糧食和物價問題</p>
<p>華北的參戰，並不是直接向着戰塲動員的意思，而是由着增產華北所有的重要國防資源，以達成大東亞兵站根據地的重要使命，這是不待說得的，目前的糧食不安和物價現象，實是對於達成這個使命的最大障碍，而也和治安的確立有關，故非早謀解決不可。華北的糧食情形，從來是靠着輸入的，然其絕對量的不足，如和華北一萬萬人口的糧食需要量來比較，則不過是其〇%已。故華北的糧食自供，母寗　表示着容易實行的。而且由於繼續着去年度的農產物緊急貫施對策，當地的增產頗著，加之，由華中，華南，滿洲，蒙疆等的輸入，也源源不絕，故糧食問題的深刻化，一方面固然是和治安有關，而一向的辦貨配給機構等，似乎也表示着尙有確立實戰體制的餘地。不過由於日華雙方當局闡明維持聯銀券對日元等價關係之確固方針。日本銀行二億日元的借款供與，以及聯銀券和儲備劵關係的確立等，現在華北的通貨已獲得了穩固的地位。一方面多量的糧食正源源輸入，又擔保壓款的物資，也大量放出來，在通貨和物資兩方面，都講求着對策，故物價也可希望漸見安定。</p>
<p>華北政務委員會，更爲期待右强力的戰時經濟的運營，設立華北物價物資處理委員會，並附設糧食管理局，以便企畫和處理物資之一元的對策，目下正在加緊準備中，不過華北經濟的安定，實是達成華北所負重大使命的前提條件，此時正特被要求着有强力的施策之運用。</p>
<p>重要物資的增產</p>
<p>華北被期待着的重要物資，是煤，鹽，鐵礦，棉花等四大物資以及各種的礦產物資。煤和鹽是戰爭中不可缺少的物資，在增產和增運上，都還有應加努力的餘地，現在則專致力於運輸問題的解決。關於鐵礦，今年度成立華北勢鐵公司，並着　於當地精鍊，目前在各地增設〇〇基羅的鎔鐵爐，以本年度出產〇〇萬噸爲目標，逐步照計劃進行着。</p>
<p>棉花由於當地的收買價格和一般物價的懸殊，現出糧食作物的競爭關係，在重要物資的增產中，實是最成問題的。不過在三十一年度裏，棉花已確保預定數量的大部分，在三十二年度，亦正在講求着種種的增產施策。（丁：譯自四月九日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>中常會決議　蘇省黨部改組</h3>

<h3>港改訂境內　通貨交換規則</h3>

<h3>此次大戰與美國財閥的陰謀</h3>
<p>把美國在第一次大戰中拖落水的，是最近傳說逝世的美國財界巨頭JB摩根（Morgan）。他爲了防止摩根商會的倒潰，怎樣用最惡辣的陰謀，榨取美國民衆的血與財產，來挽救他自身的破滅，以肥其私囊，道已經是大家都知道的常識了。然則在第二次大戰中，沒有像摩根那樣的人嗎？假使有，那是誰呢？現在有一本書記載二十年來這次大戰爭的底細，說明此次大戰的事實上的首謀者，暴露美國財閥可怖的陰謀。那就是腓立特烈·威爾所著的「未來的美國革命」，（The　Chmiing　American　Revolntion）著者是紐約著名的法律家，勞働問題的權威，站在擁護勞働階級的立塲，長年在美國法庭常勞働關係的辯護。從其觀點出發，作爲一個徹底的孤立主義者，指導全國反對美國的參戰運動。他完全贊同日本的大東亞共榮圈，德國的歐洲新秩序建設，並主張美國應與之並進而建設美洲大陸共榮圈，由於這三大共榮圈的理解提携，使世界和平永久化。茲介紹該書的槪要於左：（該書於去年在紐的出版。）</p>
<p>美國的支配者，卽所謂「美國的六十家族」。獨立戰爭時，在親英的旗幟下從事戰爭的英國貴族階級，在美國獨立後，成爲目前的六十家族的全權階級，而繼承其傳統的精神以至於今日。這六十家族把他們所擁有的鉅額財富委託於美國的二大財閥J.B摩根商會與台倫·李特商會管理。這二大財閥用所有的財富支配全美的及國外銀行，工業，鐵道及公共事業等合計共四千五百家公司。據美國週刊一幸運雜誌」（Fortune）所載，二大財閥除四千五百家公司的賞金之外、另外僱用年俸一萬五千至二萬元的經理三萬名。這些財閥的走狗，在推動琦美國的經濟組織，爲一美國的六十家族」及與此有關係的四萬六千名資本家服務。</p>
<p>前次大戰中，希望因美國參戰而得以蓄積財富的人，就是拖美國落水參戰的人，參戰的秘密，當然尙由庫根商會隱秘着，但摩根商會的巨頭雷蒙特在一九一五年四月在費拉特爾斐亞演說稱：</p>
<p>「開戰以來，我們已經供給了諸外國二億元以上的借款。假使戰事長時期繼續下去，美國卽使不是故意這樣做法，也將由債權國變成債務國，結果則美元將代金鎊而爲國際通貨。」</p>
<p>言外之意，暗示美國成爲世界金融的中心。當協約國被穗軍痛擊而陷於一敗塗地的危機時，已經從美國財界借了十五億元戰費，這時候美國駐英大使丕奇立電威爾　總統稱：</p>
<p>「美國祇有參戰以挽救摩根商會。否則美國將趨崩潰。」</p>
<p>不奇　是摩根的爪牙，每年由花旗銀行（Nationa　Oity-Band）的大股東道奇送給駐在英國的丕奇二萬五千元。</p>
<p>前次大戰發生，以經手協的國方面武器買賣而起家的摩根，早已料到美國的參戰，預先在政府的要路尤其在收購物品的要職上占了高官的地位，替華爾街的財閥充爪牙。自美國參戰至戰爭終了，美國最後一批的遺歐部隊歸國，在此期間，美國所支出的戰費達三百五十四億一千三百萬元，而從一九一六年一月至一九二一年七月美國戰時工業最後的淸　吿終時爲止，美國財閥所得到的純益有三百八十億元。相等於美國政府所支出的戰費。</p>
<p>大家都知道美國政界可分爲民主黨興共和黨二大勢力。民主黨由台倫·李特支配，共和黨則由摩根支配。</p>
<p>在一九四〇年的總統選舉中，支持羅斯福（民主黨候補）者爲財閥台倫·李特，支持威爾基（共和黨候補）者是財閥摩根。當然，在他們一夥裏</p>
<p>早已有了默契，隨便那一方獲得勝利，都沒有損失。那證據就是兩派的選舉標語羅斯福時是「援助英國」，威爾基是「救助英國」。要求民衆於「援助」「救助」二者之中任選其一。美國的「民主主義」，「投票自由」，宣傳得天花亂墜，但其實體不過如此而已。</p>
<p>我們勤勞大衆稱此次的戰爭是「財閥復權戰爭」，因爲在美國看來，此次的戰爭，其本質的意義與性格，與前次大戰並無區別。一九二九年華爾街的經濟大恐慌，美國財閥的損失達三百億元。財閥們日夜籌思怎樣彌補這損失的機會。第二次大戰就是他們所視爲千載一時的良機。他們把美國拖入需三千億元戰費的戰爭中，他們祇要從中括得十分之一，即三百億元，便可以彌補一九二九年的損失了。</p>
<p>海軍部　諾克斯，，是用摩根的資本所經營的支加哥每日新聞（chicago　Daily　News）報的社長，陸軍部次長彼得生，係在台倫·李特財閥之政治勢力的庇蔭下，從普克林地方裁判所的推事擢升者。海軍部决長福萊斯太，曾爲台倫·李特商會的社長，而陸軍部長史汀生，則是與摩根商會一鼻孔出氣的夥伴。</p>
<p>如此，陸海軍最高的地位，乃操於二大財閥之手。建造一艘戰艦，可以從中取得四百％的暴利，所以戰艦的建造與裝配，統在台倫·李特和摩根二大財閥所支配下的造船所工作，而由他們的傀儡海軍部長和次長發出文吿。海軍最高要職的部長與次長，不由阿那波里斯海軍士官學校的出身者擔任，不能不說是値得注目的事實。</p>
<p>（著者於此另有一章「英國罪惡史」，詳細叙述伊里莎伯王朝的東印度公司以來，英帝國的膨脹與侵略世界的經過。說美國財閥之濫用金權，實爲步武英國用武力來實現世界侵略。其决，乃詳細暴露美國財閥怎樣引起第二次世界大戰。）</p>
<p>所以美國著名的勞働運動指導者薩繆爾·康派司批評美國說是「第二佃英帝國」。美國決不是宣傳上所說的「民主主義」的國家。金權階級在美國玩弄所有的策略，施行連國民自身也差不多不知道的奸計。金權階級的巧妙的宣傳，在這些奸計上包上了甜蜜的糖衣，着上了魅力的色彩，出賣國民人衆。其决，我們再看美國金權階級的政治宣傳的內幕與其幕後的眞相。美國在英國的利權之中，潛伏着美國的對穗舊利權問題爲中心的特殊事件。美國爲欲向德國算淸舊賬？故把英國當作敲門磚，使英國闖入穗國的大門。美國怎樣把英國當作他的籠中物，怎樣用對德宜戰的形式，把英國置於德國的襲擊之下，此中眞相，不能不說是國際陰謀中的一個</p>
<p>一九二四年，台倫·李特財閥，決定收買全部魯爾鐵工業，想組織德國鐵工業托辣斯。這托辣斯是一家支配克虜伯，迪生，許地恩納斯及其製鐵企業的大股票公司。票公司的支配權握於台倫特財閥之手。以弗立茲，爲其駐傯代表，這樣，台倫財閥把德國鐵工業抓到手中。然而之後又發見了累墜的障碍當時德國內政情况，雜亂無，極爲混沌，恐怕有妨於台倫財閥所手植的「花一的生長。</p>
<p>若沒有預先確保像美國那樣的政治的安全性，不敢冒險投資於國外的事業。在美國，摩根與台倫·李特各抓住了共和黨與民主黨在他們的手中，不管政府屬於何黨當政，事事都須仰財閥的鼻息。因此，金權階級以爲在國內是絕對安全的，但在德國則不然。他們以爲美國完備的政治與政治組織，恰如把「投資之花」關在玻璃屋子內，雖然徒供玩賞，並且在經營上也沒有指望，但那花總可以有生長的運命。經營上的無能力，可以用政治的並政府的保護這玻璃屋子來遮掩。但在德國則政府尙在社會民主主義的治下，蘇聯則正在援助占當時德國人口三分之一以上且日趨擴增中的德國共產黨。「投資之花」出毛病了，魯爾事實上在破產狀態中。雖然他們是用五分作一元的一銀行價格」來收買的。</p>
<p>所謂銀行家買東西是專門場便宜的，他們的確以爲魯爾鐵工業的到手是獲得了便宜李。前次大戰後，摩根與台倫貨特財閥對原來的德國通貨加以攻擊，使魯爾鐵工業破產，因爲魯爾是歐洲最有組織的鐵工業。從一九二二年至一九二四年，他們用通貨膨脹的方法，使魯爾鐵工業變成無價値的東西。據台倫李財閥駐穗代表在紐的的美國銀行公會所作的聲明：「因此使魯爾鐵工業破產，至一九二四年，僅用極少數美元就收買了魯爾鐵工業。」</p>
<p>當時蘇聯對美國資本家施行了很巧妙的計策，蘇聯賦與台倫李特財閥之一員的哈里曼公司獨佔的權利，使該公司用資金並機械投資於蘇聯的　鑛，於是哈里曼公司投資了一千五百萬美元。之後，蘇聯政府藉口不分紅利，開始爭執，結果，獨占權取消，哈里曼的投資全部被沒收。當時有許多美國資本家向蘇聯投資的遇到多起同樣的事件。因此，台倫李特財閥聯想到蘇聯正在扶植德國的共產黨勢力，對台倫的魯爾鐵工業不也要用同樣手段對付嗎？於是台倫財閥爲謀對抗起見，在穗國物色足與共產黨分庭抗禮的政黨，而我到了反共產主義的團體德意志勞工黨，卽之後的德意志國民社會主義勞工黨，現在的德國總統希特勒，當時已經是該黨魁首，如此，台倫李特熱心希望這國民社會黨保護對魯爾的投資，不要被德國共產黨侵害。</p>
<p>一九三三年一月三十日希特勒登台，這時候台倫財閥祇希望對魯爾的投資能免稅就够了。然而這也遭到了拒絕，德國當局用强硬的態度，對台倫李特投資於魯爾的，與國內其他一切企業課以同率的稅金，德國當局與台倫李特之間因此開始了政治的鬥爭，在這狀態之下，美國無能的投資家，有力無處使，台倫的魯爾鐵工業終以滯納稅金而不得不出賣德國政府。而加上了海爾曼·格林鐵工業的名稱。</p>
<p>鐵工業歸德國政府所有，也就是說魯爾鐵工業從美國財閥之手復歸於德國人民，而有利於德國的勤勞者。但犧牲了台倫財閥而以利益給與德國的勤勞階級，德國政府的這一合法行爲，却大爲華爾街的金權階級所不滿而發生了强烈的敵意。「復仇！」「爲打倒德國勤勞階級而戰爭」！他們竭叫起來了。在華爾街的奸惡的幹部室中，並在其所操縱的傀儡，華盛頓政府中官員們的事務窒中，都不謀而合地這樣竭叫起來了，他們的「朋友」希特勒，國社黨不再替他們當差了。於是其結果，對希特勒，對德國，展開了有計劃的伺隙以乘的鬥爭。最初德國是被稱爲「適於投資的國家」，希特勒，國社黨是美國金權階級的傀儡。現在他們覺得已不再像他們的美國傀儡羅斯福及民主黨一樣指揮如意。於是他們遂非難希特勒及其指導者。</p>
<p>一九三三年春，被憎惡希特勒及德國的情感所驅使，台倫開始利用羅斯福，使美國國民從事對德戰爭的準備。用政治的策略，抓住對政府的支配力，此後如不聽指使，隨時可由美國財閥資本家使之下台。對穗國美國金權主義者也以爲可用這方法。不過如何實行，必需另有計劃。而他們的計劃乃是驅使英國對德宣戰，做他們的爪牙，想因此而使德國返還魯爾鐵工業的支配權於台倫財閥。</p>
<p>台倫財閥的策略，想用支配通貨的方法來支配英帝國。果然在一九三三年之秋獲得成功。這時候美國的統計家們，忽然想到英國在前决大戰中所欠的戰債尙有二十五億元未曾償還。台倫財閥乃計劃全部收買倫敦金融市塲的全部黃金，而再要求英國用黃金來支付戰債。試問英國那裏再有黃金呢？一面並凖備英國買同黃金起見，在該年的美國議會通過「托瑪斯修正法」，授與總統有調整黃金價格之權。假使英國想買回黃金，破壞台倫的計劃，則美國提高黃金的價格。</p>
<p>至該年末，着着進行凖備，使英國可以發表其破產宣言。在倫敦召集世界經濟會議，即是爲了這一目的。當該會議閉幕的時候，皮佛勃路克帶了先已預備好的聲明書宣言英國破產。這宣言揭載於倫教的每日快報（Daily　Express），正可以視爲英國這一條巨大的「章魚」日趨滅亡的說明。英帝國五億人民之驚悸的心臟，默然等待喪鐘的撞擊。這是人類歷史上具有劃時代重大性的一個時期。這是英帝國的呻吟瀕死的吿白。這敗北的反響，每個人都滯着下述的一種神態，喃喃地說：「英國啊！被你壓迫的奴隸們，現在見到你的失敗，吐出了歷年來積貯的一口怨氣了！」茲從每日快報上摘錄皮洛洛克的英國破產宣言如次：</p>
<p>「在一九二二年，英國的對美戰債，大槪達四十億，這筆款子是英國參戰後向美國偕得者，迄今日和平已吿恢復，美國希望這戰債償還，但英國一般人則不信有此可能。（中略）債務不能用黃令來支付，因爲英國沒有這許多黃金。用增加英國商品的輸出來支付亦不能，因爲美國不要買這許多東西。用貿易的差額來解，亦不可能，因爲英國預計每年都是入超的，亦有人說英國可以用別的資產來支付戰債，例如英國的屬領等。當然，戰債的償還是無望了。因爲不能償還，所以結果英國國庫破產，黃金喪失。這是眞眞的破產。（下略）</p>
<p>據此破產聲明，英國破產的事實，是毫無疑義的確事了</p>
<p>打倒英國的皇帝—當時是老皇喬治五世—奪取皇冠，這是紐約華爾街中財關們的陰謀。當時策劃的根據地是華爾街二十三號的摩根財閥的大本營與那蘇街百五十號台倫財閥的大本營。他們有二個計劃：第一是摘取「腐爛中的英國之李」，第二，叫英國向德國索　投放於德國「奮爾之花」交還台倫財閥。第一項已經巧妙地計劃着且實行着了。</p>
<p>一九三四年的金準備法第十節，經當時華盛頓的議會通過實施。這據美國報紙上發表乃是「爲了緩和失業問題」的措置。這明明是飾辭。這法律把美元對黃金的價格從一盎司二〇六·七元提高至三四·三三元。換言之，把以前的價格增加了百分之六十七。實在說來，這二種價格都是虛構的價格。美元對黃金的價格增加六七％者，乃是使英國尙未償還的戰債絕對再無力支付了。從法律上說來，因爲不償還戰償，所以美國政府在理論上是英國的破產管理人，是英國的所有者。美國的財閥　樣策動以謀獲得破產管理人的地位，就是這國際的大陰謀之眞相。（翔：譯自四月二日—四日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>最後、此次訓練中各部之異常努力、有足多者、對不幸而因公負傷者、茲於此致敬、并祝其早日痊愈、</p>
<h3>昨全日警報四次</h3>

<h3>防空須知　問答（三）</h3>
<p>（問）隨時隨地敵機來襲，要鎭靜如恒，到底要鎭靜到怎樣程度呢？</p>
<p>（答）敵機時常在候我們的疎忽懈怠，以片刻也不能大意，平常的時候，都要準備隨時被空襲的工作，祇要平時有充分準備，敵機，炸彈是不足懼的，先要當心燈火管制，必須常備遮光黑帘，掛在漏光的窗戶上，臨時用布或紙遮在臥室，廚房厮所等屋內各處，如果容易漏光的窗戶，最好用黑面紅底的雙層帘子，這種準備，有用於夜間空襲的。但是白天空襲，炸彈裂開震碎玻璃或彈片飛過的時候，有了這種帘子掛在窗戶上，也能避免若干損害；至於防火方面，每一戶都要常備防火用水槽，連好自來水的橡皮管，預備泥土，黃沙，沙袋，鉛桶，撲火器具等，如果沒有水槽和鉛桶，就用浴盆，以及其他可以貯水的器具來代替，有了水槽必須注意隨時要裝滿淸水，還要預備在必要時去利用附近的井，池，小河裏的水。</p>
<p>其次，看到火勢移動的時候，就要把引火物收藏起來，事先應該有一佃準備，最好是把引火物放在鋼骨水泥的地方，同時防空用的工裝（鞋子，足袋，頭巾，手袋，毛巾等）不可分離，必須包在一起，放於特定的地方。</p>
<p>萬一　到空襲的時候，必須把全體家屬應做的任務分配妥當，譬如說吧：戶長擔任總指揮和對空監視，主婦和長于擔仟防火，長女担任照料老弱者的避難事宜，次子來擔任傳還消息的工作，同時在情勢緊張時，須要把貴重物品收藏於袋內，每一段地區由防察班長抽派各戶所派出的工作人員來組織一隊，和家庭的塲合一樣辦法，分派工作，以上所答，都是平常時候的準備，可是最要緊的還在於臨時不慌。（四月十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>陸軍報導部發言人談　美在渝空軍現狀</h3>
<p>日本在上海陸軍部報道部發言人、昨（十五）日下午三時、於循例招待本市中國新聞記者團常會席上、發表美在渝空軍，之現狀云、</p>
<p>美機力量襲日困難</p>
<p>美在渝空軍、企圖以廣西桂林、湖南衡陽、福建建甌三處爲空襲日本本土之根據地、目前此三處飛機數量、雖略有增加、但力量微弱、則不言可喻、蓋美國空襲日本本土之前哨根據地、早在開戰之初、即爲日軍佔領、故美對日空襲企圖、迨屬夢想、關於此點、美羅斯福總統前於林肯誕辰紀念日發表之談話、亦坦率承認、美對日空襲根據地、業已消失、非將南太平洋失守之每一島嶼逐一克復、則空襲日本實無可能性、然此一幻想、決難實現、惟有利用渝方大陸根據處、企圖一逞、</p>
<p>往返不便採取游擊</p>
<p>美利用渝空軍根據地以來事實上亦已證明對日空襲、爲極困難事、預料今後困難益見增加、年前美曾一度對日空襲、但事實上因根據地喪失關係、僅以空中游擊戰演出而巳、益以日空軍在中國大陸實力、與美空軍在渝力量相校、相去懸殊、故目前已無積極行動、美如進襲、則非消耗日本之實力不可、至就美之遊擊戰言、不外以偷摸行動演出、漫無目的、不足驚異、在效果上反無是論、合言之、美國進攻日本本土、已缺乏其可能性、良以進擊根據地旣已喪失、且更碍於日空防力量之嚴密與强大、往返又感不便、如一經出動、則有遭半途邀擊陷於潰滅之危機、如去年四月十一日之盲目行動、結果非惟未達目的、且遭受重創而歸、</p>
<p>縝密防範以策萬全</p>
<p>美國在渝空軍力量雖弱、但仍不斷凖倫、亦未可知、美國在渝空軍原隸美在印陸軍十航空部隊管轄下、最近始改組成立第十四航空部隊、成一獨立單位、歸美在渝印緬三方總司令部直接指揮、此項改組、似爲增强力量之表示、故吾人對和平區防空設備、必須準備完成、以策萬全、雖美目前力量仍屬不足、尙難遽犯和平地區、但亦不可不縝密防範、</p>
<h3>浙贛路定期　恢復通車　—本月二十五日—</h3>

<p>現在憑藉政治地位，和利用金融力量，以操縱市塲，經營大規棋的投機事業者，可說路人側目，舉國皆知了。據這次密查結果，許多巨戶常有巨額定期支票支付，並有運用於投機囤積的嫌疑。此輩憑藉勢力利用力量，做此非法勾當，已非一日。政府敬能懲前毖後，鑑於官商混淆的弊寶，則今後凡是經營金融和商業的人，絕對不容混跡政途從中漁利；處身政界的，絕對不可投資商業，擔任金融和商業公司的董監及重要職務。</p>
<p>總之要做到「官商分野」，嚴守壁桑的地步；做官的絕對不可營商，營商的絕對不應做官。政府要人和金融巨頭，更不可私投資本，取巧化名，縱其親戚僚屬與民爭利。不可利用地位力量，以供給其親友發財之機會。此點實爲目前最起碼的條件，亦爲澄淸吏治的根本辦法，千萬不可再事姑容，再事放縱，否則時機一過，故態復萌，已往的弊端仍有死灰復熾的可慮，甚至有變本加厲的可能，所以斬草除根便在今日。</p>

<p>該局對於調整組織以上十業同業公會，特遵照工商同業公會暫行倏例第四條之規定，已指定（一）沈錦洲，龐潤生，顧麟書，朱純伯，韓不豪，爲本市煤球業同業公會發起入，並指定沈錦洲爲召集人，（二）指定沈錦洲，徐貴生，魏志大，毛春圃，陸琪生，劉念祖，房爾淸，爲本市煤號業同業公會發起人，並指定沈錦洲爲召集人（三）指定許曉初，袁鶴松，高堵良，屠開徵，央致富，鮑國昌，劉步靑爲本市新藥業同業公會發起人，並指定許曉初爲召集人，（四）指定張輔仁，張競顯，唐煥初，孫德良，徐榮發，爲本市工業油脂業同業公會發起人，並指定張輔仁爲召集人，（五）指定劉安慶，陳承綸，陳明治，楊潤林，施志舉，方肇奎，李蔚如爲烟葉販賣業同業公會發超人，並指定劉安慶爲召集人（六）指定沈維挺，張大連，楊秉彝，沈德華，王秋泉，兪藹裕，裘九浩，趙薈　，孫寳祚爲捲烟火柴皂燭業同業公會發起人，並指定沈維挺爲召集人，尙有棉花業同業公會紗號業同業公會，針織業同業公會，布業同業公會等四公會發起人名單，定今（十六）日即可發表，聞以上十業同業公會，限各業發起人於四月廿五日以前組織完成及將籌備經過情形，詳細呈報核辦。</p>
<h3>謀減低製造成本　決維持煤球限價</h3>
<p>關於煤球價格問題，茲悉目前無增高之可能，每担二十五元之標準限價，決予持久實行，晚近製造成本雖已較賭過去酌增，然煤球商曾興日方負責方面一再洽談，設法减低成本，現日當局業已派負責人員專程赴平，接洽减低產區價格，故煤球漲價之說誠屬無稽。</p>
<p>三煤球廠修理機件</p>
<p>近數日來各煤球零售商之門售現貨，似較數日前减尠若干，推其原故，當不出於下列二點。（一）義泰興，東方，國華三大煤球廠均在修理機件，生產量不無稍减。（二）一般人心惶恐不定，各自購積，以備不時之需，以致門市現貨供不敷求，乃致發生誤會，現該三製造廠機件業將完全修竣，義泰興已定今日起全部開工出貨，國華東方兩廠亦可於明後日起恢復工作。</p>
<p>製球原料到存豐裕</p>
<p>至於用以製造煤球之原料（煤屑）目前的爲焦作屑，赫凌屑二種，焦作屑產自河北，赫凌屑產自朝鮮，如用以製造煤球尙無不可，但該項原料到存均豐，前途供應決無虞匱乏，由關係當局公允配給，各廠足敷應用，其餘則進棧儲積，以備逐漸派售。</p>
<h3>銀行界討論　肅清投機囤積</h3>
<p>自政府當局派員來滬澈查各金融機關投機囤積事件以來，某商辦銀行已由政府下令將其停閉，已見昨報。茲悉本市銀行界方面爲協助當局撲滅囤積並厲行銀行界之「自肅體制」起見，將於日內召開重要會議，討論對策，聞所討論之主要問題，將爲今後對於投機囤積商人，絕對不再貸予資金，如某銀行今後仍與投機囤積者相勾結，或竟直接暗營投機囤積，一經查明，全體銀行將採取（一）全體銀行與該行停止一切交易往來；（二）全體銀行一律拒收該行支票；（三）由銀行公會開除該行之會員資格等三項對策，以爲懲戒。</p>
<h3>雜糧業聯合會　日方三籌備員選定</h3>
<p>上海雜糧業聯合會，前經商業統制總會指定日方籌備負責者井上泰忠（三井物產支店代理長），華方籌備主任符前耕後，昨據記者獲悉，該會刻下復選出日人籌備委員三人如下：（一）梅澤（三菱洋行），（二）鈴木（軍配組）（三）栗本（贏華洋行），至於華方籌備員，亦正由雜糧業方面推選中云。</p>
<h3>上海特區內印花稅　上月銷數增加　計達五十餘萬元</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　江蘇省印花菸酒稅局，自今年改組成立以來，對於稅政推進成績頗良，稅收已較往昔增加，以前原有上海特區印花稅處撤銷後，該局爲便利購貼印花稅稅票及革除推銷制之舞弊起見，即將派員推銷印花稅制取銷，凡各業商民，購用印花均可直接向九江路該局購置，故印花稅票銷額大見增加，尤其財政部稅務查緝處查緝偷稅，嚴密各業商爲免受漏貼之處罰，均已普遍照章粘貼印花，茲悉本年三月上海特區內印花稅票銷額增達五十餘萬元，較二月份印花銷額，增加的近二十萬元云。</p>
<h3>華北實業署長談　華北糧食管理問題</h3>
<p>北京十五日中央社電　華北政委會實業總署督辦王蔭泰氏此次代表政委會參加國府還都三周年紀念典禮幷與華中關係方面，就調整華北經濟，華中食糧輸往華北及其他問題進行折衝，茲已任務完畢，返抵此間，特於十四日招待中日記者團，說明當前食糧物價問題，大意謂（一）關於本年度華北食糧關係方面，正力謀由滿洲蒙　方面運入，此次又商妥由華中運入相當數量之麵粉，故本年可由各方面運入大批食糧，且數暈亦較客歲爲多，供應當可圓滑，價格亦不安定。（二）於戰時下一切均須實施統制，當局前曾設立物資物價處理委員會，及食糧管理局，着手統制，今後願民衆多事協助，斷能强化，幷擴充統制工作。（三）華中近已成立全國商業統制總會，故華北亦應設立統制交易機關，關於此事已命有關方面着手計劃，於最近期開當可成立。至糧食之配給，亦需由中國方面負責中持，故決定委託商人收買，然後交由糧食管理局方面發行配給。</p>
<h3>京市糧食局成立　新局長談施政方針</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電</p>
<p>京市糧食局長一職，業經行政院會議通過，任命劉渤充任，中央社記者昨特訪氏面詢京市糧食施政方針，承發表談話云：「此次奉命承乏本市糧食局，深感責任艱鉅，非本人菲村所堪勝任，故對於一切分內事務，以後自當竭盡棉薄，盡力破除一切困難，本市中樞整個國家糧食政策，秉承周市長之指示，以竭力從事工作，値茲戰時體制下，糧食爲國家整個之命脈，尤以首都方面，更形重要，故本人今後決以全力，謀生產增加，强化管理，以期供求相應，節約消費，以求配給合理，享受平均，對於水產畜產及一切副食品飲料調味料代用食品等配給，私運囤積，亦當嚴加監督，至於嚴懲舞弊，禁絕攙維等，尤爲首務，俾得民生安定，使社會更趨繁榮，秩序不致紊亂，而可各個安心本位事業，以謀同心協力，完成大東亞戰爭之後方工作云云，並聞該局於今（十六）日正式成立，同京市公糶委員會亦告撤銷。</p>
<h3>物價問題與自由經濟</h3>
<p>— 叔</p>
<p>近年來物價不斷上漲，市民受生活之壓迫，日甚一日，不安心理，佈滿全市。查物價變動之原因，不外貨幣與貨物二方面。貨幣方面包括紙幣發行額，及金融機關之放款，貨物方面，則包括物貴之供求情形。</p>
<p>先就供求情形言。所謂供求對於物價之影響者，實際僅指「有效之供求」而言即實際在市塲上之賣買，始與物價發生關係。年來生產呆滯，原料來源斷絕，一般擁有資金者，大事囤積居奇，故雖有大量存貨，但「有效之供給」不暢，而「有效之需求」，反因投機心理之普遍而增加，因之物價就扶搖直上矣。</p>
<p>次就貨幣方面之情形而言。一般投機者，常以此方面之膨脹爲藉口。考諸事實，發行額未呈膨脹之象，當局曾再三加以闡明。至若信用膨脹，雖無正確之數字可據，但假定確有信用膨脹之事實，則其原因亦大。硏究。查金融機關之放款是否爲信用膨脹，要視其放款之性質而定。若對囤積居奇者放款，是爲信用膨脹，若對生產者放款則不然。物價上升可爲信用膨脹之結果，而後者乃爲投機行爲之結果。因之投機者雖可以物價上升，歸罪於信用膨脹，而不知信用膨脹，實爲其自身行爲所迭成者也。</p>
<p>物價上漲之原凶，旣如上述。但上漲之最後根源，即止於此乎？換言之，貨幣與貨物二方面之不洽調，在任何環境下，都能引起物價之上漲乎？曰不然。所謂物價受貨幣及貨物二方面之情形而上漲，其所以有此因果關係者，最大之前提，實爲自由經濟機構。唯有在自由經濟機構下，不正當之放款可以產生供求失調，可以引起物價普週之上升。換言之信用膨脹供求失調等，對於物價之影響，乃爲一種自由經濟下之現象；而以信用供求等，作爲物價上漲之藉口，實根源於自由經濟之思想。環顧各國，因戰事而供求失調者，比比皆是，但其物價，並不因之而劇漲，有如我國之甚者，蓋金融方面，物資方面，均有合理有效之統制也。然則所謂貨幣貨物二方面，可以引起物價上漲者，實爲目由經濟機構，與乎目由經濟思想之作崇耳。</p>

<h3>「愛」與「美」的敎育</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>在人生修養方面說起來，這兩種愛與美的敎育，並不僅僅乎限於敎育「兒童」，我們人的一生，誰都不能一刻脫離這兩種敎育。現在的人世，所以如此陰冷黑暗，就爲了缺少「愛心」與「美心」。</p>
<p>直截的說：「愛心」是『待人』的眞諦，「美心」是『自我』人格的修養。所謂「做人」，就是要在人生中充實這兩種敎育，使人類走向光明之路，要迭成人們理想中的世界，就得從愛與美的敎育出發。</p>
<p>在聖經中耶穌問他的門徒說：「你愛我嗎？」現在就把這句話問大家，「你愛我嗎？」這句話的眞理就是要探問自己有多少「愛心」，「愛」不能私自珍藏起來，應當要像空氣一樣擴散出去，我們接受了父母的愛才得成長，我們有了朋友的「友愛」，在事業上才會成功，我們從人之開始到結束時時生長在「愛」中，別人的愛我們都大量地接受了，那麽你豈能把你自己的一部份珍藏起來呢？你敢想像嗎？假如全人類全能互相貢獻「愛」，我們何必還要幻想天國呢？</p>
<p>「美」的敎育是「愛」的敎育的基礎，每個人一定要有「心靈的美」方能「愛人」，「心靈的美」能陶冶溫良的品格，純潔的思想，不論在事業上，家庭中，朋友間他都能得到完美的成功，產生愛人的力量。</p>
<p>我希望每個一天到晚爲了金錢而奔波的人，能在每天有一些時候，靜靜地坐下來，可能的話不妨培植自己的「審美力」，聽一些音樂，欣賞一些圖畫，看幾本好的書，有上一個機會來自我的愛與美的敎育，回想每天的生活，校正自己的行路，日久之後我相信它會在你的人生中滋長出一顆潔白的百合花，使你有一顆純潔坦白的心，這樣才會體味到人生是有意義的。</p>
<p>捫心自問「我要多少愛，有多少美」，給它一個滿意的答覆。這敎育完全要自己負担起來的。</p>
<h3>前提</h3>
<p>— 江渢</p>
<p>營養問題其實是經濟問題！</p>
<p>在「米珠薪桂」，「豆腐要賣肉價錢」的今日，許多人家連靑菜，豆腐也吃不起，那裏還談得到營養？</p>
<p>營養的前提是鈔票，沒有鈔票，休談營養！</p>
<p>我輩窮小子只能對營養而興嘆了。</p>
<p>肺癆的蔓延，主要原因，由於人們營養不足，其癥結，在於物價的高漲。</p>
<p>若不謀根本解決，而只在枝節問題上兜圈子，那是「捨本遂末」而已。</p>
<h3>怎樣制止忿怒？</h3>
<p>— 炳賡</p>
<p>我們在社會上不喜歡和一個性情暴躁的人在一起，因爲我們和他相處，總是動輒得咎，往往無緣無故的做了他的出氣筒。在發怒者的本身方面，在忿怒的時候，能使消化的機能停止，神經的組織受到擾亂，厲害的時候，甚至肝臟爆裂而死。何况在盛怒之下理知失去了主宰，無端可以殺人，使親友叛離。所以忿怒在個人和社會方面都沒有什麽利益，如果不加控制，往往貽害無窮。</p>
<p>忿怒是人類基本情緒之一，它的力量是非常偉大的。制止的方法，第一在設法免除足以引起忿怒的原因；第二，在將發作未發作之時，以極强的意志去壓制它，使之縣崖勒馬</p>
<p>在忿怒的時候，我們總是咬牙切齒，磨拳擦掌，疾言厲色。在這時，最直接的制止方法，就是故意把說話的聲調說得柔和些，每句的說話說得慢些，並設法把已經緊張了的肌肉鬆弛下來。這時因爲忿怒的「狀態」沒有存在，所以忿怒在無形之中也就消滅了。一</p>
<p>間接制止忿怒的方法也有好幾種。如：（一）暫時的離開足以引起忿怒的環境；（二）心中默數數目；（三）轉移自己的注意力到別的地方去。道幾個方法，如果行之得法，都有極大效果。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>『有甚麽要緊。』阿五用手在臉上抹抹，抹去了汗與雨。『那才爽快呢！不要臉的放刁，說「隊裏人』來了，就此逃走了。「隊裏人」我都認得的，來了很好，可惜沒有來。…」</p>
<p>做買賣的又逐漸集合了攙來，一切情形恢復到了沒有打架以前。除了孩子們，大人們大都也就不將打架這事放在口頭。</p>
<p>一担豆腐花歇在他們的面前，阿五用手一招說：舀兩碗來。』</p>
<p>兩人剛剛吃完，阿五又喊了『添兩碗來。了一連添了三次。最後一次添過，大根便連忙阻止說：『不要再添了，反正是吃不飽的，等刻到我家去吃點心吧。』</p>
<p>阿五笑着付了錢。</p>
<p>霧還在一陣一陣地迷來，雨水不但沒有停止，反而由絲變成綫，有些人在分向東西二面走着，不再呆站着。</p>
<p>『三月半老是有雨，最討厭！』阿五恨恨地說，『只好回去了。』</p>
<p>說了，他就和大根並肩向西走着。他們不打算走來時的路。走過老君殿鬥口時，他們沒有進去。老君殿過了，他們索性斜斜地向西南走，繞過了一個高墩後面的大帝廟，就落到了靈山西端向南延展的支麓上。這條路上的人很多，不但靈山西面諸鄉鎭的人都走這條路，便是南面的人，也都有走這裏的。（三十二）</p>

<h3>二月份徵文錄取第七名　怎樣讀書，讀什麼書？（下）</h3>
<p>— 倪圭章</p>
<p>二·各科讀書法</p>
<p>（一）語文　書本上的知識，都用文宇來代表，我們要獲得知識，不能不先識文宇。無論本國文或外國文，學習的方法，大致相彷。我們知道學習語文，必須要多看各種作品，要精讀優美的句文，最好能背能默，要多練習爲作，要多講解書中的意義。並須研究文法，對於字·詞·句·段的分析，要一一能了解。而對於社會現狀，人羣動態，尤須切身體騐，仔細觀察。那末讀文寫文的能力，自能進步了。</p>
<p>（二）哲學論理學之類　要求得眞理，要思想有系統，便須求得這類知識。舉習時，第一應認識各種名詞的意義，第二要搜集例證來比較硏究，第三要能切實應用。</p>
<p>（三）自然科學　包括物理·化學·動物·植物等，要學這些知識時，必得多採標本，多加實騐。更須研究如何控制自然，利用自然的方法，因此而有新的發明，新的發現，使人類的生活，更能合乎理想。</p>
<p>（四）社會科學　包括歷史·地理·政治·經濟·敎育·社會等，學習時，必須沒有成見，處處以客觀的態度去硏究，對於實際問題，應設法解答，並多看參考書報，以資印證。</p>
<p>（五）數學　包括算術，代數，幾何，三角等，學習時，在心理方面，必須沒有絲毫的怕懼；在方法方面，第一要了解基本觀念，第二要熟記定理定義，第三要多做習題。</p>
<p>上面所說的基本讀書法和各科讀書法，旣簡且陋，自不能盡讀書法之萬一。但望歡喜該書的人，斟酌情形，善自應用而已。</p>
<p>讀什麽書？</p>
<p>我們用了這許多讀書方法，那末究竟去讀些什麽書呢？這確是一個難解答的問題。何况「我生也有涯，而知也無涯」。在這短短的一生中，安能讀盡天下的書籍！因此，我們覺得一個人應該讀的書，可以分爲下面的三類：</p>
<p>（一）必需讀的　如體育，衛生，可以健身；公民，倫理，可以健心；法律，黨義，可以做好公民；歷史，地理，時事報章，可以認識時代，做一個新時代的人。所以這幾種書，是人人必需讀的。</p>
<p>（二）與職業有關係的　如醫帥，應多讀生理學，解剖學等；如建築師，必須讀美學，美術史，市政學等；如銀行行員，必須讀中外的統計報吿，以及物產，交通，農工商各業狀况的書報等；如學校敎師，必須讀敎育史，敎學法，心理學，及民衆敎育等；務使本身的職業能因此而更有進步。</p>
<p>（三）與興趣有關係的　如歡喜文藝的，多讀新舊創作；歡喜養魚養鳥的，多讀養魚養鳥的書；愛攝影的，多讀攝影的刊物；嗜弈棋的，多讀棋道方面的書籍。</p>
<p>至於在校的學生，除所有的課本，都應明瞭通解以外，又須多看課外讀物，參考書籍；尤其不能不看新出的雜誌報章，以增進新的知識。</p>
<p>努力讀書！</p>
<p>爲了篇幅所限，恕我對於讀書的方法和應讀的書目不能再加詳細的說明了。深望世上不論男女老小，不論貧富智愚，都能認淸讀書的目的，都能應用良好的讀書方法，去努力地閱讀必需讀的，與職業有關係的，和合於興趣的書籍，那末我們便可以做成明理的健全的人了。</p>
<h3>談談寫作</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>說到寫作這事，在許多人看來，大概都認爲很艱難的。</p>
<p>不錯，有的人，有很多的意思要想發表出來，但是可惜的是筆不達意，枉自有了豐富的意思。有的人文筆到還淸順，祗可惜的是文思枯燥，想不出該寫些什麽材料，也辜負了自己的才幹。</p>
<p>其實，祇要肯專心，人人都能寫，我當然不是說立刻就能寫幾萬或數十萬字的著作，這裏須先從短篇的文章上下手，每作一篇文章，先要經過一决詳細的思慮，明白全篇中要說的是些什麼，然後再落筆，文字起初但求其通順，祇要於思想上沒有什麽不完全的地方就可以，以後再逐漸的注意到修辭和延長，如果能照這樣做去，不愁不會寫作。只是有一樣要注意，假使沒有經過思慮，或是自己心中沒有什麽要說的話，那末千萬不要下筆，有一般人平素毫無寫作的技能和操練，突然的爲了某一種的需要，而冒冒失失的拿起了筆瞎塗，不管文筆是怎樣的惡劣粗俗，不管思想是怎樣的不合暹輯，他們祗是塗，只想在把一本稿紙塗滿了黑色的東西付印之後，就可伸手拿到酬報，但是却從來不想到對於文學上已留了一個絕大的汚點，在十七世紀法國名作家拉勃呂哀爾的著作中有一篇就是說這一種人</p>
<p>他說：『有一個人，突然之間，也未嘗在前一天思慮過，拿起了紙筆，自己對自己說：「我要寫一本（書）！」他，除了五十塊金幣的需要之外，再沒有別的需要了，也就是說寫作的能力了，我徒然的向他喊道：「去拿起一把鋸吧！提亞克勤！鋸吧！或是尋些磋磋磨磨的工作做，或是製作些車輸上的木框，你終也能得到你所要的酬金的！」他沒有學過這些手藝！「那麽抄寫吧！謄錄吧！做一個印刷所中的校對員吧！千萬請你不要寫！」但是他要寫，他要付印，並且因爲人家通常不能將空白的稿紙去付印的，於是他將這簿子塗滿了他所喜歡寫的東西，他隨便地寫些薩納河是流過巴黎的，一星期中共有七天，或是天氣將要下雨了的句子』這些句子使別人習慣地感到毫無意義之外，對於公衆也沒有什麼別的擾亂，於是他的妙作通過了檢查，而付印了，更在成爲這一世紀文學上的羞辱和使那些高明的作者簪他覺得慚愧的情境之下，他的妙作又再版了</p>
<p>我們怎樣來寫作呢？我們必須具備廣大的深切的生活經騐，經過大時代的洗鍊，考騐，運用高明的文學手腕來記錄着，這類的寫作才有意義。</p>
<p>但，「千層之台，起於累土」，我們毋須畏怯而不敢動筆。</p>
<p>動筆祗要愼重而誠懇。</p>
<h3>忘「我」</h3>
<p>— 仲信</p>
<p>我們常常看到兩個或更多的人，面紅筋露在爭辯不休。他們爲的是甚麼？大半是在爲他們自己的偏見辯護。</p>
<p>人心難得有和平公正的時候，牠常常是偏袒的，主觀的，任意的，無論是對一個人，一樣東西，或者是一樁事。</p>
<p>要考慮正確的客觀事實，必須忘記有「我」之存在，這就是最難辦到的一椿事。因爲每一個人記得最牢的總是「我」啊！</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>禮物折現之好辦法</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>禮尙往來，經有明文，誼重餽贈，俗所難免，當昇平盛世，亦人之常情，若當茲亂世，流離載道，門內方張祝壽賀婚之席，虛糜物力於無形，門外正聽啼飢號寒之聲，欲延殘生而不得；觸目驚心，仁者不爲，而况婚喪喜慶，新張開慕，致送者率多軸幛花籃銀盾鏡架之類，接受者允有敬使台力筵宴酬答之勞。本市貧病救濟協會，本人類有互助之義，會秉此意旨，勸吿各界人士，以後凡婚喪喜慶，新張開幕，致送之禮物，在此非常時期中，一律改折現金，移充善舉，一方爲親朋造福消災，一方爲貧病延生乞命，一舉兩得，善莫大焉。</p>
<p>前日上海浙紹醫院，舉行開幕典禮時，由院長袁履登君出面所發之請柬，上刊「如蒙惠賜隆儀，請概賜現金」十一字外，背面幷由董事長裴雲卿出面，勸人送體概折現款之文，內有「茲當正式開幕之期，式縞紵之聯情，將瓊瑤之報往，凡與院長雅故，及同鄉之愛護敝院者，則請推抱痌瘝，易玉帛而爲兼金，即藉儀文而資實惠，庶幾春風所被，益以廣袁公錫類之仁，抱注之間，在敝院實拜玉成之德」等語、指定上海工業銀行，同潤錢莊，中一信託公司，匯中銀行分行，浦東銀行等五家代收，結果收到六萬餘元，旣不暴殄天物，而合政府節省物力之訓，又能撥充院用以補經常經費不足之需，足資效法，用特表而出之，以吿閱者。</p>
<h3>助產學會　協助防疫工作</h3>
<p>本市防疫工作業由當局積極舉辦，並分區組織防疫班，近正徵求醫務人員踴躍參加，以便限期注射。本市助產學會爲協助防疫起見，特行徵求會員參加防疫工作，如有熱心服務者，務請速向該會接洽，會址新閘路醬園弄口二五一號。</p>

<h3>We Now Only See "Catching Small Fish"</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, speculators, unable to continue trading in the black market for foreign exchange, have turned their attention to hoarding daily necessities. Yarn, cloth, candles, soap, cigarettes, and Western medicine have all become targets of speculators. Among these, yarn and cloth, being major commodities, are especially favored by speculators. Although Shanghai is the center of yarn and cloth production and possesses enough cotton products to meet the consumption needs of Central China for ten years, or even the next five years, the price of yarn and cloth continues to rise daily. The rapid increase in the past two or three months is particularly alarming. Taking the price of 20-count yarn at the beginning of the lunar new year as a standard, the current price of yarn has reached over 300% of that time. No one can deny that this is due to the influence of speculative hoarding, and no one can help but grit their teeth at the behavior of these speculators!</p>
<p>After the National Government announced its order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation, the general public, on the one hand, praised the government's wisdom, and on the other hand, inevitably worried that the government might not be able to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter. If orders are issued but not investigated, investigations are conducted but not handled, and handling is not thorough, it will inevitably reduce the people's faith in the government. Subsequently, Chen Zhishuo of the Finance Committee, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of thorough investigation, Yuan Yuqian of the Executive Yuan, and Chen Yunwen, supervisor of the National General Association of Commercial Control, successively came to Shanghai to implement the thorough investigation with Zhao Zunyue, secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government. We in the journalistic community, given the severity of the National Government's order, deeply knew that the background of the speculators was by no means simple, unanimously voiced our support, and encouraged them in various ways, urging them to take the public opinion of millions of Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai as a backing for those ordered to investigate and handle the matter. We deeply feared that a "flash in the pan" would cause the flames of speculation to spread further, the people's suffering to intensify, and at the same time, cause us to be scorned, ridiculed, and coldly regarded by friendly nations.</p>
<p>The investigators appointed by the National Government this time hold considerable positions in the government. We firmly believed that they would be able to fulfill the government's mission and not disappoint the people. However, after the National Government received the report from the investigators, it issued an order on the 13th, stating, "...other uncompleted investigation matters should be continued by the competent department to ensure that unscrupulous merchants know to restrain themselves and prices can be stabilized." And in a speech on the 14th, Chen and Yuan, the two vice ministers in charge of the investigation in Nanjing, said, "This work has come to an end... However, there may be more than just these hoarding unscrupulous merchants. Although we have returned to Nanjing, the investigation work will continue." This means that the thorough investigation task of the four high-ranking officials has come to an end, and only "uncompleted matters" and "hoarding unscrupulous merchants, or more than just these" will be further investigated by the competent department.</p>
<p>We have not hesitated to repeatedly and earnestly elaborate on this investigation case, and we believe that we have said everything there is to say from every aspect. However, the response we have received so far is only this, and we truly feel that our voices have become hoarse. As the saying goes, "Following good advice is like flowing water" and "Yielding to public opinion" are relative, not absolute. If one simply "turns a blind eye," there is simply nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, we have always believed that if the government disregards the people's livelihood, it will be impossible to improve politics. And speculative hoarding is the greatest political enemy harming the people's livelihood at present. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We always cherish the government, and even more cherish the people's livelihood. Under this sentiment, we present our sincere words of advice again today.</p>
<p>If we take the companies, banks, and individuals pointed out by the National Government's explicit order as having evidence of hoarding and ask all the citizens of Shanghai, "Do you know them?" the answer "No" would probably account for 99 percent of the population. It is unbelievable, even to the most foolish, to say that such unknown companies and individuals are large-scale hoarders who manipulate the entire city and harm the entire society. There must be powerful people behind them instigating them, and there must be ten or a hundred times more people who are truly disrupting the market and harming society. The rumors in society have become an open secret. The companies and banks pointed out in the National Government's explicit order have undoubtedly committed crimes worthy of punishment by massively hoarding goods and disrupting the market. However, if others who are even more heavily involved in speculative hoarding are still allowed to roam free, where is the law and discipline of the country? Is the government willing to condone and tolerate this, sacrificing the hearts of the people of the whole country in order to protect a few lawbreakers? Recently, there has been a bad political example, namely, the corruption case in the transport of the Yunnan-Burma Road under the Chongqing regime last winter. Did Kong Xiangxi not think that killing one Lin Shiliang would reduce the just voices of public opinion and restore the psychology of society? However, the prodding of public opinion did not slow down because of this, and the psychology of society did not change because of this. What society and public opinion demand is that Lin Shiliang's crimes deserve punishment, and that those who instigated Lin Shiliang should be treated equally with a just attitude of putting righteousness before family.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding this thorough investigation of the hoarding case, we would like to raise three questions, requesting satisfactory answers from the government and the investigators to dispel public doubts:</p>
<p>(1) What is the original capital of the companies and banks pointed out in the National Government's explicit order as having evidence of speculation? How much of this capital was used for speculative hoarding? Where did this capital come from?</p>
<p>(2) Who are the major shareholders and important directors and supervisors of the two commercial firms? Are there any government officials involved?</p>
<p>(3) If it is believed that the members of the two commercial firms are all "unscrupulous merchants" among pure merchants, then are there absolutely no government officials involved in speculative hoarding? We certainly do not hope that public officials engage in speculative hoarding. If the facts are indeed true but not reported and thoroughly investigated, and deliberately covered up, then we believe that this thorough investigation by the government's explicit order is an absolute failure.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Courage of the National Government</h3>
<p>The National Government issued an order on the 13th, stating that the Shanghai Zhenhua Company has factual evidence of hoarding important materials and disrupting the market. The persons in charge of the company should be strictly handled by the court. The Futong Bank is suspected of major offenses and should be ordered to suspend business and send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It can be seen that the National Government is already implementing punishment for speculative elements, and we sincerely admire the courage and implementation of the National Government. The Chinese people are also deeply concerned about the success of this policy. Therefore, whether the National Government can implement its established policies is related to the people's faith in the National Government in the future.</p>
<p>Suppressing hoarding is, of course, a way to stabilize people's livelihood and improve the economy. At the same time, due to Japan's policy of promoting China, this is also an inevitable measure that the National Government cannot shirk in its obligation of justice. Japan's policy of promoting China, needless to say, seeks to create the substance of a real central government for the National Government, so that it can independently maintain domestic security. Today, the disturbances caused by speculation are extremely sinful, no less than the disturbances caused by bandits in the local area. If the National Government's local investigation of speculation is abandoned halfway, not only will the people be greatly disappointed, but it will also greatly disappoint Japan, which is disregarding all sacrifices to help the National Government strengthen itself. In this sense, implementing the suppression of speculation is not only a domestic issue in China, but can also be said to be a moral responsibility that the National Government owes to Japan.</p>
<p>The accusation of Zhenhua Company is only the National Government's first attempt to stabilize people's livelihood. In the future, it will need to use stricter and more thorough methods to have full effect. If the suppression that has begun once is abandoned halfway due to some relationship, then the harm is greater than not suppressing it. Just the National Government's publication of an order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation has caused considerable shock in Shanghai's financial circles, and now it is taking steps to implement it, making speculative elements fearful and uneasy. The question is whether the National Government can overcome actual relationships of all kinds and eradicate speculative hoarding in the future. Rampant speculative hoarding is certainly unfortunate, but the National Government can take this opportunity to show its fairness, strictness, and courage. May the authorities of the National Government rise up and strive! (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 15th Continental New Daily)</p>

<h3>Five Division Commanders in Guangdong Take Office After Reorganization of National Army Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Claims to Have Lost Confidence in Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) Since hearing the news that the British Indian army was besieged and annihilated by the Japanese army at the Burmese western border command during the counterattack in Burma, Chongqing has expressed despair at the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. This issue was mentioned in Chongqing's overseas broadcasts, and it was pointed out that if Britain and the United States do not actively attack Japan again, they will lose the trust they had in the past. The general idea is that the British Indian army's counterattack on the western border of Burma has failed again, which is very disappointing to us. At the same time, it reduces the general public's trust in Britain and the United States. We now know that the British army can no longer recover Burma, and we no longer hope that the Yunnan-Burma Road will be opened. The most worrying thing at present is that the general public, who have adhered to the words of the authorities for six years of the war of resistance, now also recognize that Britain and the United States are not reliable. If Britain and the United States quickly adopt an active offensive, then our trust will be difficult to continue.</p>
<h3>German Chargé d'Affaires in China, Guo Defei, Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) German Chargé d'Affaires in China, Guo Defei, came here on the 8th of this month to have a cordial conversation with the Chinese and Japanese authorities, and went to Hong Kong on the 12th.

<h3>Wang Yintai Discusses the Food Problem in North China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) Wang Yintai, the Industrial Supervisor of North China, participated in the third anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital on behalf of the Political Affairs Committee, and held consultations with the Central China regarding the adjustment of the North China economy, the transportation of Central China food to North China, and other issues. Now that his mission has ended and he has returned here, he held a reception for the press corps on the 15th to explain the current food and price issues. The general idea is: (1) Regarding the North China food situation this year, related parties are working hard to transport food from Manchuria and Mengjiang. It has also been agreed that Central China will supply a considerable amount of flour. Therefore, a large amount of food can be transported from various sources this year, and the quantity will be more than last year, the supply can be smooth, and prices can be stable. (2) During wartime, everything must be under control. The authorities previously established the Materials and Prices Management Committee and the Food Administration to start controlling things. In the future, they are willing to have the public provide more assistance so as to strengthen and expand the control work. (3) The National Government has recently established the National General Association of Commercial Control, so North China should also establish a branch for controlled transactions. Regarding this move, the relevant parties have been ordered to start planning, and it should be established in the near future. As for the allocation of food, it has been decided to entrust merchants to purchase it and then hand it over to the Food Administration for allocation.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Administration in North China (2): Establishing Security and Completing the War Participation System</h3>
<p>Food and Price Issues</p>
<p>North China's participation in the war does not mean direct mobilization towards the battlefield, but rather to increase the important national defense resources of all of North China in order to fulfill the important mission of being the base for the Greater East Asia logistics. It goes without saying that the current food insecurity and price phenomena are the biggest obstacles to achieving this mission, and are also related to the establishment of security, so it is necessary to find a solution as soon as possible. The food situation in North China has always relied on imports, but the absolute amount of shortage, compared with the food needs of North China's 100 million people, is only 0%. Therefore, North China's food self-sufficiency should not be easily achievable. Moreover, due to the continued implementation of emergency measures for agricultural products last year, the increase in production in the local area is quite significant. In addition, imports from Central China, South China, Manchuria, Mengjiang, etc. are also continuous. Therefore, the deepening of the food problem is related to security on the one hand, and the procurement and distribution organizations, etc., seem to indicate that there is still room to establish a wartime system. However, due to the clear policy of maintaining the equivalence between the United Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen clarified by the Japanese and Chinese authorities, the provision of 200 million Japanese yen in loans by the Bank of Japan, and the establishment of the relationship between the United Reserve Bank notes and the reserve notes, the currency of North China has now gained a stable position. On the one hand, a large amount of food is being continuously imported, and on the other hand, materials that guarantee the repayment of loans are also being released in large quantities. Both in terms of currency and materials, countermeasures are being sought, so prices can also be expected to gradually stabilize.</p>
<p>The North China Political Affairs Committee, in order to expect strong wartime economic operations, has established the North China Materials and Prices Handling Committee and attached the Food Administration to it, in order to plan and handle the unified countermeasures for materials. It is currently stepping up preparations. However, the stability of the North China economy is a prerequisite for achieving the major mission of North China. At this time, the implementation of strong measures is particularly required.</p>
<p>Increased Production of Important Materials</p>
<p>The important materials that North China is expected to produce are coal, salt, iron ore, cotton, and various mineral resources. Coal and salt are indispensable materials in war, and there is still room for improvement in increasing production and transportation. At present, they are focusing on solving the transportation problem. Regarding iron ore, the North China Steel Company was established this year and started local smelting. Currently, 00 kiloton iron melting furnaces are being added in various places, with the goal of producing 000,000 tons this year, gradually proceeding according to plan.</p>
<p>Due to the disparity between the local purchase price of cotton and the general price level, there is a competitive relationship with food crops. Among the increased production of important materials, this is the most problematic. However, in the 31st year, most of the planned amount of cotton has been secured, and in the 32nd year, various production-increasing measures are also being sought. (Ding: Translated from the April 9th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Central Standing Committee Resolves to Reorganize the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) The reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters was ordered and decided upon at the 69th meeting of the Central Standing Committee.

<h3>Hong Kong Revises Rules for Currency Exchange Within the Territory</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency) The Hong Kong Governor's Office authorities, in view of the increasing need for military scrip due to the progress of various construction projects, have revised the rules for currency within the territory and its exchange, and decided to abolish the past restriction on purchasing military scrip with Hong Kong dollars. The above measures will be announced by the Governor's order on the 16th. Therefore, regardless of the amount, military scrip can be freely purchased with Hong Kong dollars from now on.</p>
<h3>Brief News: Propaganda Conference Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) The Nanjing Propaganda Office, in order to establish the policy for propaganda work under the wartime system, has decided to hold the second Nanjing Propaganda Conference on the 24th of this month. It has been actively preparing for everything in the past few days. In addition to inviting personnel from the competent authorities to come and provide guidance, relevant agencies will also be invited to send personnel to attend and discuss.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Promotes Forestry Production</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Central Reserve Bank Widely Uses Military Script</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) Since the Central Reserve Bank note has been used as the standard for all transactions since the 1st of this month, the credit of the Central Reserve Bank note has become more stable. The number of citizens who go to exchange notes at various banks and money shops has increased sharply due to the increased need for citizens to use the Central Reserve Bank note for payment. As for the Guangzhou branch of the Central Reserve Bank, the Guangdong Provincial Bank, and the Allied Banks, the exchange business has also increased compared with last month after the exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes and military script was improved starting this week.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Consolidates Water Security</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) In order to consolidate water security, the Provincial Police Department plans to strengthen the water patrol agency.

<h3>Appropriations Allocated for Repair of the Canal Embankment in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Taizhou, 15th (Central News Agency) This year's spring repair project for the canal embankment in northern Jiangsu was submitted by the Ministry of Construction to the central government for appropriations to be carried out. It is now learned that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Construction has written a sincere letter to the people along the canal.</p>
<h3>Southwest Pacific Front: Japanese Air Power Greatly Increased; New Guinea Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - A military correspondent for the "Haitong News Agency" commented on reports of a significant increase in Japanese air offensives in the South Pacific region, stating that Japanese air power in the South Pacific appears to have greatly increased. The number of aircraft used by Japanese planes in recent air raids on Guadalcanal and Port Moresby is far greater than before. Also, the recent bombing of an American convoy near Florida Island by Japanese planes also involved large formations, resulting in extremely heavy losses for the American convoy. The increasing Japanese air power has caused deep concern among Australian residents.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific are deeply concerned about the recent continuous bombings by Japanese aircraft. According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain (San Francisco), anti-Axis commander MacArthur acknowledged on the 13th the increase in Japanese air power, stating that the anti-Axis forces' first line of defense should be based on land-based air power. If we lose air supremacy, Japanese air raids on Australia will be very easy. Considering that the Pacific War will be decided by air power, the fact that Japan is increasing its air power north of Australia is something the Australian people must be wary of. The Japanese military has threatened the Western Pacific and the periphery north of Australia with submarines, and the area around Australia has become a no-man's land. Therefore, securing air supremacy is one of our means of defense. However, if Japan obtains this air supremacy, it can use its air force to protect convoys to the coast of Australia, allowing its army to land on islands near Australia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 14th that powerful Japanese air units bombed Milne Bay on New Guinea Island during the daytime on the 14th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Melbourne, General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Headquarters issued a communique stating that a strong Japanese air fleet raided Milne Bay in New Guinea at dawn yesterday. Although the communique stated that details were not yet available, Australian Supply and Shipping Minister Beasley acknowledged that the Japanese air raid resulted in fires and caused damage and casualties, but did not specify the exact location of the raid.</p>
<h3>Japanese Local Governors' Conference Successfully Opens; Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Address</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo personally delivered an address at the Local Governors' Conference today, lasting an hour. He expressed the government's strong determination to deal with the current situation, stating that within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, thanks to the brave and resourceful Japanese army, a solid and unshakeable state has been consistently maintained, and construction matters are also progressing steadily. The trend of the war situation is increasingly advantageous to our side, and the people of the whole country should adhere to their belief in certain victory and must not be swayed by the enemy's propaganda tactics. It is also noted that this Local Governors' Conference has also successfully concluded today.</p>
<h3>Governor Ba Maw Returns to Rangoon; Expresses Impressions of Visit to Japan; Praises Japanese National Spirit</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - After Governor Ba Maw and his party returned, they paid homage to the Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma's only large pagoda, at 10:30 this morning, praying for the outcome of their visit to Japan and their future resolve. Upon hearing the news, the general public gathered near the pagoda, and the city of Rangoon was in a lively state.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - After returning here on the 14th, Burmese Governor Ba Maw met with a group of reporters at 6:00 PM and engaged in a question-and-answer session, as follows: Reporters asked, "What are your impressions of Japan during wartime?" Governor Ba Maw replied, "During this long war, Japan is simultaneously advancing in both material and spiritual aspects, mobilizing the total strength of the nation to prepare a strong fighting force. The excellence of its military industry and the vastness of its production capacity are particularly astonishing. At the same time, manpower is also very abundant." Asked, "What are your impressions of Prime Minister Tojo?" He replied, "When I met with Prime Minister Tojo, I deeply felt from his words and attitude that Japanese politicians are extremely sincere in their policy towards Burma. I believe Prime Minister Tojo is a true representative of Greater East Asian politicians. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be completed if politics are not implemented with Greater East Asia as the principle." Asked, "What are your impressions of visiting the Ise Grand Shrine, Meiji Shrine, and Yasukuni Shrine?" He replied, "The Japanese national spirit can be fully understood by observing their devout thoughts and attitudes toward the shrines. I believe that the Japanese national spirit's greatness is displayed in the attitude of the Japanese people's respect and reverence for the shrines." Asked, "How does the Japanese family compare to the Burmese family?" He replied, "Emphasizing etiquette and focusing on the family are characteristics of the Japanese family. Burma is the same as Japan. This is completely contrary to Western individualists. The ethics of East Asia are centered on the family. The strength of the Japanese people is also due to the excellence of the family." Asked, "Is there anything in Burma that can be emulated from Japan?" He replied, "When I traveled to various parts of Japan, what moved me the most was the soundness of the Japanese national organization and the strength of their sense of responsibility. This is certainly something that should be emulated." Asked, "What are your impressions of various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere?" He replied, "When passing through various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, I was truly impressed by the rapid progress of local construction. In particular, the hardworking state of the citizens of Syonan (Singapore) under the guidance of the car government can serve as clear evidence. I firmly believe that the city will surely become the most prosperous giant town in the Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<h3>Army Department Epidemic Prevention Team Arrives in Yangzhou</h3>

<h3>Axis Forces Resist Bravely; Fierce Fighting on the Entire Tunisian Front; Canadians Participate in Operations in the Mountains; British and American Aircraft Attack Sardinia, Shooting Down Five</h3>
<p>Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters issued a communique today stating that there is active fighting on the entire Tunisian front, especially in the western region, where the enemy launched an offensive with fierce artillery fire, but was defeated by the Axis forces. The German Air Force shot down multiple enemy Spitfire fighters. Furthermore, when enemy aircraft attacked Sardinia, the Italian Air Force shot down four four-engine heavy bombers, and anti-aircraft guns shot down one aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the North African front, the main force of the Axis forces on the Tunisian front has successfully withdrawn from the south and center and concentrated in the north, firmly defending the mountainous positions in the Bizerte and Tunis areas to repel the anti-Axis forces. On the 13th, fighting broke out between the two sides near Mejez El Bab on the Bania road and in the Kairouan area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to military sources here last night, the British First Army in northern Tunisia has intensified its attacks on the western segment of the German-Italian positions in the eastern Atlas Mountains, but has been repelled each time. In order to strengthen their defensive operations in this area, the German-Italian forces launched an effective counter-offensive on Tuesday. At the same time, fighting has also begun on the southern segment of the new Axis defense line. A large detachment of the Montgomery forces is crossing the area from which the Axis forces retreated in the past few days. The British Eighth Army is generally in front of the Axis positions, completing its deployment to confront the Axis line with heavy troops. It is said that the British forces made exploratory attacks in several places on Tuesday, but were defeated. A military correspondent for the Haitong News Agency commented on the Tunisian situation last night, saying that General Montgomery's attempt to use his tanks alone to open a path for his troops in the mountains along the northern coast of Tunisia has not been very successful. The German counter-offensive on Monday inflicted a heavy blow on the British forces northwest of Susa and halted their advance. By Tuesday, the Axis forces had cleverly laid mines, and the Axis rearguard had bravely resisted again, so the British advance was still very slow. Therefore, the vanguard of General Montgomery's forces only reached the southern edge of the mountains by Tuesday evening. Yesterday morning, British tanks and motorized units attempted to enter the mountains but were repelled. It is still difficult to say whether General Montgomery will continue to advance in order to achieve his goal of preventing the Axis forces from strengthening their mountain positions, or whether he will stop advancing to wait for his infantry and artillery units. Anti-Axis sources said there was a slight delay and that a reorganization was necessary. The right wing of General Anderson's forces in the Bou Arada area, after being reinforced by French rebel troops, is attempting to advance toward Jebel Chargui. However, there is currently very little progress. In the central region, fierce fighting continues in the mountains north of the highway from Oued Zarga to Mejez El Bab. The British forces used Canadian and Scottish troops there, but General Arnim's forces fought bravely to defend every inch of land. The German positions that were broken into by the anti-Axis forces have been replenished. Fighting continues in the coastal area south of Cape Serrat. The purpose of the British First Army's intensified attacks is nothing more than to contain the German-Italian forces or to prevent the Axis forces from using their reserves on the western flank of the bridgehead, so that General Montgomery's forces may encounter less resistance in the south. A strike from Mejez El Bab to Tunis, only fifty kilometers away, is also the most cost-effective strategic goal. But it is doubtful whether General Anderson is willing to make such an attempt while the German wedge still exists in the mountains north of the highway from Oued Zarga to Mejez El Bab, because the German forces there can seriously threaten the flank of the British forces advancing towards Tunisia.</p>
<h3>German and Romanian Leaders Meet; Strengthening Unity; This Move is Particularly Significant Amid Developments in the Mediterranean War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German Headquarters announced on the 14th that the German leader Hitler had received the Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. Both sides, in the spirit of friendly relations between Germany and Romania and the fighting unity of the Three-Four Alliance countries, discussed the overall political situation and the joint struggle against communism and Anglo-Saxon plutocracy for two days. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Chief of Staff of the Leader's Headquarters Keitel participated. During the meeting, the leaders of the two countries reaffirmed their determination to continue the war against the enemies of Europe by all possible means. The Romanian people, in solidarity with the Axis countries, are determined to continue the fight until final victory is assured, and based on their contribution to the liberation of Europe, they will guarantee the future of the Romanian people. During this meeting, Antonescu was accompanied by Colonel Davidescu, Secretary-General of the Romanian wartime cabinet, and other staff members of the Romanian General Staff. The German Ambassador to Romania, Kilinger, and General Hansen, who served in the German military command in Romania, were also present.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu recently visited the German leader Hitler with Colonel Davidescu, Secretary-General of the wartime cabinet, and others, and held meetings for two days. Now that the meetings have ended, he left here at noon on the 14th to return to his country.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - After meeting with Bulgarian King Boris III, Hitler met with the Italian Prime Minister and the Romanian Prime Minister. Now, before the spring offensive begins, he is advancing towards establishing a wartime system for the entire continent of Europe. After the end of the winter war each year, Hitler routinely consults with the allied countries on the military and political aspects of the spring offensive. Now that the World War has entered its fourth year, and as the situation in Tunisia progresses, the situation in the Mediterranean is becoming increasingly complex, it is widely believed that Hitler's meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu is of particular significance. On the 14th, the German Foreign Ministry quoted the Leader's Headquarters' communique to express its views on the significance of the meeting, as follows: (1) It is noteworthy that the communique clearly states not only resistance to communism but also the struggle against Anglo-Saxon power. It is believed that the entire European continent must be united in this war. The Romanian government, as a neighbor of the Soviet Union, is directly threatened by communism and has expressed its determination to continue its opposition to Britain and the United States. This is a good lesson for countries that believe that their territory may not be threatened by communism. (2) The communique also reviewed Romania's position after the war, stating that the country has made great contributions to European civilization and development and should bear the qualifications to build a new post-war order. This is a lesson learned from past wars. (3) It is natural that the allied countries have expressed their determination to move towards final victory after the Eastern Front allies' operations have suffered considerable setbacks. If anyone attaches other meanings to this meeting, the development of the war situation will surely make them realize that the biggest mistake is to underestimate the strength of the Allied forces and the results of the total mobilization of the entire European continent.</p>
<h3>Center of Eastern Front War Shifts to the Leningrad Area; Fighting Still Underway in the Middle Donets Region</h3>
<p>Moscow, 14th (Central News Agency) - Today, a telegram was received from the front, stating that the German command has begun a large-scale offensive westward toward Leningrad with tanks and infantry. Yesterday, the German forces repeatedly attacked the Soviet defensive positions around the city. In the upper Donets, German forces launched a fierce attack on the Barakov bridgehead, 50 miles southeast of Kharkov.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the 13th, the center of the Eastern Front war has been concentrated in the southern Leningrad region and the Balairaklia region in the middle reaches of the Donets River. On the surface, it appears to be a local war, but in reality, the two armies are fighting for important strategic strongholds. This is the beginning of a large-scale offensive and defensive war in the future, which is worth watching. The following is a summary of the news from various sources up to noon on the 14th: (1) The Soviet positions in the southern Leningrad region were broken by the German forces on the 13th, causing the main force on the left wing of the Soviet army defending the Leningrad outer area to suffer a major threat from the German forces. (2) It is reported that German forces attacked the Soviet crossing point on the east bank of the Donets River in the area south of Barakov, inflicting a devastating blow. (3) The clearing operation launched by the German forces in the Kursk region has progressed very smoothly in the past two days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to British sources from Moscow last night, the situation of the Soviet forces in the bridgehead around Balakleya on the west bank of the Donets River, east of the Izyum to Kupyansk line, has become serious. The situation developed favorably for the German forces yesterday. The left flank of the Soviet bridgehead has been broken through by the German forces. According to the German official news agency, the German forces in the central Donets River region attacked the east bank of the river, encircling and annihilating the Soviet forces there. Currently, apart from the fighting in this area and other locations, there are no changes in the Eastern Front situation. The German large and small-caliber artillery bombarded the Soviet positions along the Donets and Mius Rivers with mortars. In the northern region, the German forces conducted a clearing operation in the Kursk region, capturing 130 people. In addition, it is reported that more than 500 Soviet soldiers were killed in action. Berlin reported that a German team composed of tunneling engineers and grenadiers successfully attacked south of Lake Ilmen, capturing 184 people. The Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga attempted to drive the German forces away from their new positions but were repelled and suffered heavy damage. In the past few days, the German Air Force bombed the Kupyansk area and the area around Novorossiysk, causing heavy losses in manpower and materials. Therefore, the Soviet forces in the Kupyansk bridgehead had little activity on Tuesday, while the Soviet forces in the nearby coastal area were forced to retreat.</p>
<h3>German Planes Bomb British Armament Factory; British Planes Attack Southwestern Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - It was announced here today that German bombers attacked an armament factory north of the Thames River in England last night, causing significant damage. The air raid began shortly after midnight and lasted for about thirty minutes. Fires broke out in many places. Because the weather was clear and the visibility was very good, although the British had obstruction balloons, intense anti-aircraft fire, and fighters, they were not enough to prevent the German planes from completing their mission. According to news reports, British bombers also attacked southwestern Germany last night, indiscriminately dropping bombs and causing considerable damage to residential areas. To date, 15 British planes have been shot down by the Axis forces. A single enemy plane was also found dropping bombs over East Prussia, but the losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Axis Countries Consolidate Economic Front; Germany Has No Fear of Food Shortage</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London, the British Minister of Economic Warfare replied to an inquiry yesterday, stating that we have no reason to expect the economic collapse of the Axis countries. Germany has also recently had no shortage of food in its occupied countries, because the Axis countries have apparently collected sufficient supplies for use next winter.</p>
<h3>Germany's Secret Military Buildup Before the War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Hua Ningjie, design director of Rheinmetall and the Krupp Armament Factory, recently revealed for the first time the details of Germany's secret military rearmament at a meeting of the Technical and Literary Association, stating that Germany's secret manufacture of munitions began in 1921. At that time, the construction of new artillery was carried out extremely carefully, and the work of the department was limited to what could be kept secret and not detected by the Allied Management Committee. Its office was initially located in Berlin, then moved to Düsseldorf, and later to the bushes of Lüneburg. The great military development in the years before the war was all due to the secret preparatory work of the department.</p>
<h3>Turkish Newspaper Advocates Expanding the Balkan League</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Vatan newspaper here advocates the establishment of an expanded Balkan League, which should include Turkey, Serbia, Romania, Greece, Croatia-Slovakia, Albania, and Hungary. This kind of alliance will be of great benefit to Hungary for exporting its goods to the region, and it will also be the best opportunity to eliminate the Romanian-Hungarian conflict. The newspaper also stated that this alliance should adhere to the principle of equality, with no distinction between large and small countries and between victors and losers.</p>
<h3>British and Italian Exchange of Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - Seriously injured prisoners of war from Britain and Italy will soon be exchanged in Portugal for the first time. The British ambulance ship "Newfoundland," carrying hundreds of Italian prisoners of war, will arrive here tomorrow. The British prisoners of war have already started their journey to Lisbon by train. At the same time, 104 Germans from Guatemala and Costa Rica will arrive here on the Spanish ship "Comillas." Most of them are women, children, and the elderly. They will be exchanged with residents of Guatemala and Costa Rica residing in the Axis countries. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Lisbon next Thursday but may be delayed for several days.</p>
<p>Vatican City, 15th (Central News Agency) - When the gates of Vatican City opened yesterday morning, three uniformed soldiers entered and immediately reported to the authorities, admitting that they were escaped British prisoners of war. One of the three was a junior officer and two were sergeants. They were airmen who were shot down during a British air raid on Turin. They were later taken to a military hospital in Rome. After obtaining uniforms in the hospital, they escaped. Because of the uniforms they wore, the Italian police mistakenly identified them as members of the Axis' African Legion. Vatican officials said yesterday that they have begun negotiations with the British Embassy to the Holy See, and it is likely that the three will be exchanged for Italian prisoners of war.</p>
<h3>Indian National Defense Council Discusses Food Issues</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi, the ninth Indian National Defense Council, chaired by the Indian Governor-General on the 12th in New Delhi, discussed countermeasures to deal with food shortages and transportation difficulties. The following are the key items decided by the meeting: (1) In order to prevent Japanese air raids, it was decided to improve food storage and transportation facilities. (2) The state of Punjab will continue to be prohibited from exporting food such as wheat and rice. Furthermore, there is a severe shortage of food in India, but the British military headquarters has permitted other overseas British troops to replenish their food from India. The food shortage will become more and more severe in the future.</p>
<h3>Flooding in Turkey</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) - After heavy rains, the Sakarya River flooded, and nine villages became swamps, causing great damage.</p>
<h3>This Great War and the Conspiracy of American Financial Groups</h3>
<p>What dragged the United States into World War I was J.B. Morgan, the recently rumored deceased giant of American finance. The story of how he used the most vicious conspiracies to drain the blood and wealth of the American people in order to save his own business from collapse and enrich his own pockets, to prevent the Morgan banking house from collapsing, is already common knowledge. But in World War II, was there no one like Morgan? If there was, who was it? Now there is a book that records the inside story of this great war of the past twenty years, explaining that the factual instigator of this great war exposes the terrifying conspiracy of American financial groups. That is "The Coming American Revolution" by Frederick Wil, the author is a famous New York lawyer, an authority on labor issues, who stands in support of the laboring class, and has long defended labor relations in American courts. From his point of view, as a thorough isolationist, he guided the national anti-American war movement. He fully agreed with Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and Germany's construction of a new European order, and advocated that the United States should advance in parallel with them to build a Pan-American Co-Prosperity Sphere. The understanding and cooperation of these three major co-prosperity spheres would lead to the permanent peace of the world. The following is an introduction to the outline of the book: (The book was published in New York last year.)</p>
<p>The rulers of the United States are the so-called "sixty families of America." During the War of Independence, the British aristocratic class who engaged in war under the pro-British banner, after the independence of the United States, became the plenipotentiary class of the current sixty families, and inherited their traditional spirit to this day. These sixty families entrusted the huge wealth they possessed to the management of the two major American financial groups, J.B. Morgan Banking House and Talen Little Banking House. These two major financial groups used all their wealth to control a total of 4,500 companies throughout the United States and overseas, including banks, industries, railroads, and public utilities. According to the American weekly "Fortune" magazine, in addition to the rewards from the 4,500 companies, the two major financial groups also employed 30,000 managers with annual salaries of 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. These lackeys of the financial groups are promoting the economic organization of the United States, serving "the sixty families of America" and the 46,000 capitalists associated with them.</p>
<p>In the previous Great War, those who hoped to accumulate wealth due to the participation of the United States in the war were those who dragged the United States into the war. The secret of participation in the war is, of course, still concealed by the Kugen Banking House, but the giant of the Morgan Banking House, Raymond, said in a speech in Philadelphia in April 1915:</p>
<p>"Since the start of the war, we have provided foreign countries with loans of more than 200 million yuan. If the war continues for a long time, the United States, even if it does not do so intentionally, will become a debtor country from a creditor country, and as a result, the US dollar will replace the pound sterling as the international currency."</p>
<p>The implication is that the United States will become the center of world finance. When the Allied countries were badly defeated by the Swiss army and fell into a crisis of utter defeat, they had already borrowed 1.5 billion yuan in war funds from the American financial community. At this time, the American ambassador to Britain, Peach, telegraphed President Wil:</p>
<p>"The United States can only participate in the war to save the Morgan Banking House. Otherwise, the United States will collapse."</p>
<p>Peach was a lackey of Morgan, and Dodge, a major shareholder of Citibank (Nationa Oity-Band), sent 25,000 yuan to Peach stationed in Britain every year.</p>
<p>Morgan, who started his career by handling the purchase and sale of weapons to the Allied countries after the outbreak of the previous Great War, had long anticipated the participation of the United States in the war, and had preemptively occupied high-ranking positions in important government departments, especially in the important positions of purchasing goods, serving as lackeys for the financial groups on Wall Street. From the time the United States entered the war until the end of the war, when the last batch of American troops returning from Europe returned home, the war expenses spent by the United States amounted to 35.413 billion yuan, and from January 1916 to July 1921, when the final report of the American wartime industry came to an end, the net profit obtained by the American financial groups was 38 billion yuan. Equivalent to the war expenses spent by the American government.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the American political circles can be divided into the two major forces of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Democratic Party is controlled by Talen Little, and the Republican Party is controlled by Morgan.</p>
<p>In the 1940 presidential election, the supporter of Roosevelt (Democratic candidate) was the financial group Talen Little, and the supporter of Wilkie (Republican candidate) was the financial group Morgan. Of course, there was already a tacit understanding among them. No matter which side wins, there is no loss. The evidence is that the election slogans of the two parties were "Aid Britain" for Roosevelt and "Rescue Britain" for Wilkie. The public was asked to choose one of "Aid" and "Rescue." The American "democracy" and "freedom of voting" are promoted to the point of perfection, but the reality is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>We, the hard-working masses, call this war "the war for the restoration of financial groups" because, as far as the United States is concerned, the essential meaning and character of this war are no different from the previous Great War. In the Great Depression on Wall Street in 1929, the losses of American financial groups reached 30 billion yuan. The financial groups pondered day and night how to make up for this loss. The Second World War was regarded by them as a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. They dragged the United States into a war that required 300 billion yuan in war expenses. They only needed to squeeze one-tenth of it, that is, 30 billion yuan, to make up for the losses of 1929.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Navy, Knox, was the president of the Chicago Daily News, which was operated with Morgan's capital. The Undersecretary of the Army, Peterson, was promoted from the position of judge of the Pukelin local court under the political influence of the Talen Little financial group. The Naval Minister, Flaisetae, was the president of the Talen Little Banking House, and the Secretary of the Army, Stimson, was a partner who shared the same views with the Morgan Banking House.</p>
<p>In this way, the highest positions in the army and navy are controlled by the two major financial groups. Building a battleship can generate a huge profit of 400%, so the construction and assembly of battleships are all carried out in shipyards controlled by the two major financial groups, Talen Little and Morgan, and the orders are issued by their puppet Naval Minister and Undersecretary. The fact that the highest-ranking ministers and undersecretaries of the navy are not appointed from graduates of the Annapolis Naval Academy is an noteworthy fact.</p>
<p>(The author has another chapter here, "History of British Crimes," which details the expansion and invasion of the world by the British Empire since the East India Company of the Elizabethan dynasty. He says that the abuse of financial power by American financial groups is actually following in the footsteps of Britain's use of force to realize world aggression. In fact, it is a detailed exposure of how American financial groups caused the Second World War.)</p>
<p>Therefore, the famous American labor movement leader Samuel Compers criticized the United States as "the second British Empire." The United States is by no means a "democratic" country as advertised. The moneyed class in the United States plays with all kinds of tactics, implementing conspiracies that even the people themselves hardly know about. The clever propaganda of the moneyed class wraps these conspiracies in a sweet sugar coating and colors them with charm, selling out the people. In fact, let's take another look at the inside story of the political propaganda of the American moneyed class and the truth behind it. The United States has a special event lurking in Britain's interests, centered on the issue of the United States' old interests in the Swiss country. In order to settle old scores with Germany, the United States used Britain as a stepping stone to break into the gate of the Swiss country. How the United States treated Britain as its caged bird, and how it used the form of war against Germany to place Britain under Germany's attack, the truth of this cannot be said to be one of the international conspiracies.</p>
<p>In 1924, the Talen Little financial group decided to buy up the entire Ruhr iron industry and wanted to organize a German iron industry trust. This trust was a large stock company that controlled Krupp, Diessen, Hutiennes, and their steel enterprises. The controlling right of the stock company was in the hands of the Talen financial group. With Fritz as its resident representative, the Talen financial group took control of the German iron industry. However, later, a troublesome obstacle was discovered. At that time, the domestic political situation in Germany was chaotic and extremely chaotic, which was probably detrimental to the growth of the "flower" planted by the Talen financial group.</p>
<p>Without first ensuring the same political security as in the United States, they did not dare to risk investing in overseas businesses. In the United States, Morgan and Talen Little each grabbed the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in their hands. Regardless of which party is in power, everything must depend on the financial groups. Therefore, the moneyed class believed that it was absolutely safe at home, but it was not the case in Germany. They believed that the complete politics and political organization of the United States were like putting the "flower of investment" in a glass house. Although it was only for appreciation and there was no hope in management, the flower could always have the fate of growing. The lack of management ability could be covered up by the political and governmental protection of this glass house. But in Germany, the government was still under the rule of social democracy, and the Soviet Union was assisting the German Communist Party, which accounted for more than one-third of the German population at that time and was growing rapidly. The "flower of investment" had problems, and the Ruhr was in a state of de facto bankruptcy. Although they were bought at a "one-yuan bank price" of five cents.</p>
<p>The so-called bankers are experts in buying things cheap. They indeed thought that acquiring the Ruhr iron industry was a bargain. After the previous Great War, the Morgan and Talen Huote financial groups attacked the original German currency, causing the Ruhr iron industry to go bankrupt, because the Ruhr was the most organized iron industry in Europe. From 1922 to 1924, they used the method of currency inflation to make the Ruhr iron industry worthless. According to the statement made by the Talen Lee financial group's representative in Switzerland at the American Bankers Association in New York: "Therefore, the Ruhr iron industry was bankrupted, and in 1924, the Ruhr iron industry was bought with only a very small number of US dollars."</p>
<p>At that time, the Soviet Union implemented a very clever plan against American capitalists. The Soviet Union granted the Harriman Company, a member of the Talen Lee financial group, exclusive rights, so that the company invested funds and machinery in the Soviet mine, and Harriman Company invested 15 million US dollars. Later, the Soviet government, on the pretext of not distributing dividends, began to argue. As a result, the exclusive rights were cancelled and Harriman's investment was confiscated. At that time, many American capitalists who invested in the Soviet Union encountered many similar incidents. Therefore, the Talen Lee financial group associated that the Soviet Union was supporting the communist forces in Germany. Didn't they want to use the same method to deal with Talen's Ruhr iron industry? Therefore, in order to counter this, the Talen financial group looked for a political party in the Swiss country that could compete with the Communist Party, and they found the anti-communist organization German Workers' Party, that is, the later German National Socialist Workers' Party. The current German President Hitler was already the leader of the party at that time. In this way, Talen Little eagerly hoped that this National Socialist Party would protect its investment in the Ruhr and prevent it from being infringed by the German Communist Party.</p>
<p>Hitler took office on January 30, 1933. At this time, the Talen financial group only hoped that the investment in the Ruhr could be tax-exempt. However, this was also rejected. The German authorities adopted a tough attitude and levied the same tax rate on Talen Little's investment in the Ruhr and all other domestic enterprises. Therefore, a political struggle began between the German authorities and Talen Little. In this state, American incompetent investors had no place to use their power. Talen's Ruhr iron industry eventually had to be sold to the German government due to overdue taxes. And the name of the Hermann Goering Iron Industry was added.</p>
<p>The iron industry belonged to the German government, that is to say, the Ruhr iron industry was returned from the hands of the American financial groups to the German people, which was beneficial to the German workers. However, this legitimate act of the German government, which sacrificed the Talen financial group and gave benefits to the German working class, was greatly dissatisfied by the moneyed class on Wall Street and generated strong hostility. "Revenge!" "War to overthrow the German working class"! They shouted out. In the treacherous staff rooms on Wall Street, and in the offices of officials in the Washington government manipulated by them, they all shouted out without prior consultation. Their "friend" Hitler and the National Socialist Party no longer worked for them. As a result, a planned struggle of taking advantage of opportunities was launched against Hitler and Germany. At first, Germany was called "a country suitable for investment," and Hitler and the National Socialist Party were puppets of the American moneyed class. Now they feel that they can no longer command as easily as their American puppets Roosevelt and the Democratic Party. Therefore, they criticized Hitler and his leaders.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1933, driven by the emotions of hating Hitler and Germany, Talen began to use Roosevelt to prepare the American people for war against Germany. Using political tactics to seize control of the government, if they did not follow instructions, the American financial capitalists could remove them from power at any time. The American moneyed class also thought that this method could be used against the Swiss country. However, how to implement it required a separate plan. And their plan was to drive Britain to declare war on Germany and serve as their pawns, wanting to use this to make Germany return the control of the Ruhr iron industry to the Talen financial group.</p>
<p>The Talen financial group's strategy was to control the British Empire by controlling the currency. Sure enough, it succeeded in the autumn of 1933. At this time, American statisticians suddenly thought that Britain still owed 2.5 billion yuan in war debts from the previous Great War. The Talen financial group planned to buy up all the gold in the London financial market, and then demand that Britain pay the war debts in gold. Where would Britain have so much gold? At the same time, in order to prepare for Britain to buy back the gold, the "Thomas Amendment Law" was passed by the American Congress in that year, granting the president the power to adjust the price of gold. If Britain wanted to buy back the gold and destroy Talen's plan, the United States would raise the price of gold.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, preparations were steadily underway to allow Britain to issue its bankruptcy declaration. The World Economic Conference convened in London was for this purpose. When the conference closed, Beaverbrook brought a pre-prepared statement declaring Britain bankrupt. This declaration, published in the Daily Express of Britain, can be regarded as an explanation of the gradual demise of this huge "octopus" of Britain. The palpitating hearts of the 500 million people of the British Empire silently awaited the striking of the death knell. This was a period of epoch-making significance in human history. This was the groaning confession of the dying British Empire. The reverberations of this defeat made everyone murmur with a certain demeanor: "Britain! You slaves who have been oppressed by you, now see your failure and spit out the resentment accumulated over the years!" The following is an excerpt from Pilolok's declaration of British bankruptcy from the Daily Express:</p>
<p>"In 1922, Britain's war debts to the United States amounted to approximately 4 billion. This sum was borrowed from the United States after Britain entered the war. Today, peace has been restored, and the United States hopes that these war debts will be repaid, but the British people generally do not believe that this is possible. (Omission) The debts cannot be paid with gold, because Britain does not have that much gold. It is also impossible to pay with increased exports of British goods, because the United States does not want to buy that many things. It is also impossible to solve with the trade balance, because Britain expects to have an import surplus every year. Some people also say that Britain can use other assets to pay the war debts, such as British territories. Of course, the repayment of the war debts is hopeless. Because they cannot be repaid, the result is that the British treasury goes bankrupt and gold is lost. This is a real bankruptcy. (Omission)"</p>
<p>According to this bankruptcy statement, the fact that Britain is bankrupt is undoubtedly a definite fact.</p>
<p>Overthrowing the Emperor of Britain—at that time, the old Emperor George V—and seizing the crown, this was the conspiracy of the financial giants on Wall Street in New York. At that time, the base of operations was the headquarters of the Morgan financial group at 23 Wall Street and the headquarters of the Talen financial group at 150 Nassau Street. They had two plans: the first was to pick the "rotting plum of Britain," and the second was to ask Britain to demand that Germany return the "Fenner Flower" placed in Germany to the Talen financial group. The first item had already been cleverly planned and implemented.</p>
<p>Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 was passed and implemented by the Washington Congress at that time. This was published in American newspapers as a measure "to alleviate unemployment problems." This is clearly a euphemism. This law increased the price of the dollar against gold from 206.7 yuan per ounce to 34.33 yuan. In other words, the previous price was increased by 67 percent. In fact, both of these prices are fictitious prices. The 67% increase in the price of the dollar against gold meant that Britain was absolutely unable to pay its outstanding war debts. Legally speaking, because the war debts were not repaid, the American government was theoretically the bankruptcy manager of Britain and the owner of Britain. How the American financial groups plotted to obtain the position of bankruptcy manager is the truth of this international conspiracy.

<h3>The Third Comprehensive Air Defense Exercise in This City Successfully Concluded Yesterday. The Results of the Exercises in Various Districts Were Quite Good. The Air Defense Headquarters Issued a Statement.</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the third comprehensive air defense exercise in this city, yesterday (the 15th) was the last day of the later stage. After four days of training in various districts, various measures were quite meticulous. The various firefighting, fire protection, and rescue training also achieved satisfactory results. With the full cooperation of the military, police, and civilians, traffic control was orderly and the results were quite good.</p>
<h3>The Air Defense Headquarters Issued a Statement</h3>
<p>The third Shanghai area air defense exercise successfully concluded at 10 o'clock last night. Thanks to the efforts of people from all walks of life, Shanghai's consolidated air defense has been strengthened. The authorities of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters of this city issued a statement expressing their gratitude to the citizens for their enthusiastic cooperation. The results of this civil air defense training are being evaluated.</p>
<p>This air defense exercise has concluded. Looking at the past four days, the enthusiastic guidance and supervision of the relevant agencies, the activities of the instructors, the united cooperation of people from all countries, especially the efforts of Japanese groups, and the awakening of the citizens are all worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The progress and achievements in various aspects of civil air defense, such as lighting control, alarm transmission, air surveillance, traffic control, rescue, and their guidance, control, and implementation, are extremely significant. The establishment of civil air defense in Shanghai is not far off, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>However, minor matters have not yet been fully met as expected and require attention. It is hoped that all departments will review the results of this training, use the lessons learned, quickly develop countermeasures, and further study the methods of mutual assistance between neighborhoods, and mutual assistance and cooperation between people from all countries, so that Shanghai, an important base in Greater East Asia, can complete a consolidated civil air defense formation.</p>
<p>Finally, the extraordinary efforts of all departments during this training are commendable. Respect is paid to those who were unfortunately injured on duty, and their speedy recovery is wished.</p>
<h3>Four Air Raid Alarms Yesterday</h3>
<p>At half past five yesterday morning, while everyone was still asleep, the first air raid alarm was issued. Authorities in various districts implemented emergency precautions such as traffic control and lighting control. Subsequently, two Japanese planes took off and soared into the sky, patrolling the entire area. Anti-aircraft artillery at various locations immediately conducted aiming and shooting training. The sounds of explosions shook the entire city, creating a realistic atmosphere. It was not until 7:30 that the alarm was lifted. The second air raid alarm was issued at 9:15 and was lifted at 11:05. The third alarm was issued at 1:30 p.m. and was lifted at 2:55 p.m. However, the alert alarm continued to be executed. At about 8 o'clock in the evening, the fourth air raid alarm was issued and was lifted at about 9 o'clock. At 10 o'clock sharp, the signal to lift the alert alarm was issued. Thus, the third air defense exercise in the Shanghai area was successfully concluded. The various situations in each district during the air raid alarms were more stringent than in the past.</p>
<h3>Exercises Continue in Various Districts</h3>
<p>International Settlement</p>
<p>In terms of the central area, a firefighting exercise was held at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road at 10 a.m. At 3 p.m., locations such as the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road. In the Old Zhabei district, at about 3 p.m., at the Sincere Company building on Nanjing Road. In the Chengdu district, at about 10 a.m., near Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road, and multiple locations in the afternoon. Police Chief Bofu of the Bureau of Works and Deputy Chief Gojima visited the Chengdu district in the morning together with Zhongyuan, the head of the Chengdu Police Station, to inspect various districts. At the same time, the Chengdu Police Station issued orders to the Lianbao in the district, instructing residents in the district to strictly guard against air raids during the air defense period. In particular, during the hypothetical poisonous gas exercise, detailed explanations were given on various anti-poison arrangements, and towels and handkerchiefs should be soaked in water and applied to the face. At the same time, an evacuation exercise was held. In addition, other districts also held exercises in multiple locations.</p>
<p>Hongkou</p>
<p>In the naval garrison area, under the command of the Baojia General Office and the Navy, Districts 5, 6, and 7 in the area jointly held a large-scale exercise at the intersection of Bazilu and North Henan Road from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. yesterday. There were various trainings such as fire prevention, poison prevention, and evacuation. At 1:30 p.m., the 415th Baojia conducted a similar exercise at Huazui Road and Gongping Road. In addition, Districts 2 and 1 held firefighting exercises at the intersection of Huishan Road and Diutoubang Road and Gongping Road and Tangshan Road, respectively, at 3 p.m. In the Huxi area, during the first alarm yesterday, the First Fang held a firefighting exercise at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Jisi Feier Road, and the Second Fang held a firefighting exercise at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road and the Central Reserve Bank during the second alarm in the morning.</p>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>Yesterday, air raid alarms were frequently issued. After each alarm was issued in the Nanshi area, the police and the self-defense corps were able to completely implement various necessary air defense measures with quick and agile steps. The situation was more thorough than in the past three days. At about 3 p.m., a fire and rescue exercise was also held at the intersection of Xiejia Bridge and Lujiabang Road. Police authorities were present to give instructions. After setting fire to a pile of straw and burning it, the police, the Fang Baojia chief, and the self-defense corps cooperated to put out the fire. Subsequently, a rescue exercise was held, and an ambulance arrived to assist, creating a realistic situation. It was not until 4 o'clock that it was completed.</p>
<h3>Important Air Defense Information: Questions and Answers (3)</h3>
<p>(Question) Enemy planes can attack at any time and any place, so we must remain calm as always. To what extent should we be calm?</p>
<p>(Answer) Enemy planes are always waiting for our negligence and slackness, so we cannot be careless even for a moment. At ordinary times, we should be prepared for air raids at any time. As long as we are fully prepared, we need not fear enemy planes and bombs. First, pay attention to light control. Blackout curtains must always be prepared and hung on windows that leak light. Use cloth or paper to cover all places in the room, such as bedrooms, kitchens, and toilets. If the windows are easily leaky, it is best to use double-layered curtains with a black surface and a red bottom. This preparation is useful for night air raids. However, in the event of daytime air raids, when bombs explode and shatter glass or shrapnel flies over, these curtains can also avoid some damage if hung on the windows. As for fire prevention, each household should always have a fire-fighting water tank connected to a tap water rubber hose, and prepare soil, yellow sand, sandbags, lead buckets, fire extinguishers, etc. If there is no water tank and lead bucket, use a bathtub and other water storage appliances instead. If there is a water tank, be sure to fill it with clean water at all times, and be prepared to use water from nearby wells, ponds, and small rivers when necessary.</p>
<p>Secondly, when you see the fire moving, you should put away the flammable materials. There should be a preparation in advance. It is best to put the flammable materials in a steel-concrete place. At the same time, the protective clothing for air defense (shoes, socks, headscarf, gloves, towel, etc.) should not be separated and must be packed together and placed in a specific place.</p>
<p>In the event of an air raid, the tasks that all family members should do must be properly assigned. For example: the head of the household is responsible for the overall command and air defense monitoring, the housewife and the elder are responsible for fire prevention, the eldest daughter is responsible for taking care of the elderly and the weak to evacuate, and the second son is responsible for delivering news. At the same time, when the situation is tense, valuables must be stored in the bag. Each section of the area is organized into a team by the defense squad leader to draw out staff from each household, and the work is assigned in the same way as in the family. The above answers are all preparations for ordinary times, but the most important thing is to not panic in an emergency. (April 15, Continental News)</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Oil Distribution Based on Population Expected to be Sold Soon</h3>
<p>The local edible oil wholesalers have submitted a request to the military authorities for the allocation of 500 tons of edible oil for the second phase of edible oil distribution based on household registration. It is reported that the office is actively handling various procedures for shipment, etc., and is expected to complete them within a few days and start selling to the public. In addition, the special allocation of oil for the restaurant industry has been approved for resumption, and the oil for the previous period has been allocated. In addition, the special oil requested by the tofu industry has also been approved.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Sugar Distribution Based on Population Started Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, with the approval of the authorities, implemented the second phase of sugar distribution based on population yesterday. The regulations are: (1) Those in Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the city center shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Shanghai Special City Grain Administration. Those in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Public Works Department. Those in the French Concession shall purchase sugar with the sugar purchase certificates issued by the Municipal Council. (2) Each certificate can purchase half a catty of sugar at a price of 2.35 yuan. In the French Concession, an additional 2% retail tax is required. (3) If the total amount of the settlement of goods is five points or a fraction thereof, the buyer shall provide it, otherwise it shall be counted as one corner. (4) When food households hold certificates to purchase sugar, they must bring their own or sugar utensils. If packing is required, the reseller shop may charge a packing fee. (5) The validity period for purchasing sugar is from April 15 to 30. It will be invalid if it expires. (6) All resellers should handle it in accordance with the regulations. If there are price increases, shortages, or adulteration, food households can report to the cooperative or report to the police authorities nearby for investigation. (7) From this phase, the sugar purchase certificate numbers issued by the two concessions are the same as the registration numbers of the designated reseller shops. Each reseller shop shall sell according to the number.</p>
<h3>Sugar Distribution Based on Population in the City Area to be Implemented Around the 20th</h3>
<p>The scope of sugar distribution based on population in the urban area is still limited to Nanshi, Huxi, Xuhua Fang, Zhabei, and Pudong within the blockade line, and the city center area. The number of recipients is temporarily based on the population in March. Each person, regardless of age, can receive half a catty with a sugar distribution ticket. The selling price is 4.75 yuan per catty, and 2.35 yuan per catty. The Municipal Grain Bureau has already announced it separately. It is now known that the official sugar distribution date must be around the 20th of this month before it can be widely sold. The reason for the delay is that the city's resellers have only started to handle sugar delivery procedures yesterday.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei Holds Tea Party to Bid Farewell to All Circles</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and has been very busy with social events. Now that his official duties are completed, he is scheduled to return to Beijing tomorrow, and then prepare his luggage and go to Japan to take office. Yesterday, Mr. Cai specially held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel to bid farewell to all circles. The guests included diplomatic envoys from various countries in Shanghai, Japanese Ministers Horiuchi and Tajiri, Ambassador to China Dai Liangyi, German Consul-General William, Manchukuo Consul-General Ye Yegong, Hungarian Consul-General Udak, Chinese Ambassador to the Vatican Wu Kaisheng, Minister to Romania Li Fang, and Director of the International Propaganda Bureau Tang Liang.

In addition, there were more than 500 celebrities from all walks of life in the city, including Yuan Ludeng, Feng Jie, Zhao Zhengping, Pan Da, and Zhou Zuomin. The guests and hosts were very happy, and everyone had great expectations for Mr. Cai's mission to Japan. Ambassador Cai delivered a speech on the spot, saying that he would try to eliminate the estrangement between the two countries and strive to achieve true friendship and cooperation. The party ended happily at half past five.</p>
<h3>A Reward Will Be Given to Those Who Report the First Cases of Cholera</h3>
<p>This year's epidemic prevention campaign will be launched soon, and vaccinations will also be implemented. It is also stipulated that a reward of 500 to 100 yuan will be given to those who report the first five cases of cholera. The first discoverer will receive 500 yuan, the second discoverer will receive 400 yuan, and so on until the fifth discovery. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee's recent meeting, the plan for the epidemic prevention campaign divides Shanghai into eight regions, and rewards of 500 to 100 yuan will be given to the discoverers of the first five cases of cholera. At this meeting, various epidemic prevention methods were also decided. The authorities will call on residents to cooperate to prevent the spread of cholera in newspapers, radio stations, movie posters, and speeches. The previous meeting of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee was held at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai. At that time, health leaders from all districts attended, including Mr. Tashiro Yoshiaki, Director of the Public Works Department Health Office.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony Held for Police Special Training Class in Cleared Areas</h3>

Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Headquarters, personally came to give instructions, and the situation was extremely grand.</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Army Information Department Talks About the Current Situation of the US Air Force in Chongqing</h3>
<p>The spokesman of the Army Information Department of Japan in Shanghai, at 3:00 pm yesterday (15th), at the usual meeting to entertain the Chinese press corps in the city, made a statement on the current situation of the US Air Force in Chongqing, saying:</p>
<p>US Aircraft Power Finds it Difficult to Attack Japan</p>
<p>The US Air Force in Chongqing attempted to use Guilin in Guangxi, Hengyang in Hunan, and Jian'ou in Fujian as bases for air strikes on the Japanese mainland. Although the number of aircraft in these three places has increased slightly, the power is weak, which is self-evident. The forward bases for the US air strikes on the Japanese mainland were occupied by the Japanese army as early as the beginning of the war, so the US attempt to air strike Japan is just a dream. Regarding this point, US President Roosevelt also frankly admitted in his speech on Lincoln's Birthday that the US air strike bases against Japan have disappeared. It is impossible to air strike Japan unless every island lost in the South Pacific is recaptured one by one. However, this illusion is difficult to realize, and it can only be used as a base on the Chongqing continent to try to succeed.</p>
<p>Inconvenient Round Trips, Adopt Guerrilla Tactics</p>
<p>Since the US Air Force in Chongqing has used its base, it has also proved that air strikes on Japan are extremely difficult. It is expected that the difficulties will increase in the future. The US once launched an air strike on Japan years ago, but in fact, due to the loss of the base, it only performed an aerial guerrilla war. Moreover, the strength of the Japanese Air Force in mainland China is far from the strength of the US Air Force in Chongqing. Therefore, there is no active action at present. If the US attacks, it will have to consume Japan's strength. As far as the US guerrilla warfare is concerned, it is nothing more than a sneak attack, aimless, and not surprising. In terms of effect, it is not worth discussing. In summary, the US attack on the Japanese mainland lacks its possibility, because the attack base has been lost, and it is even more hindered by the strict and powerful Japanese air defense force. The round trip is also inconvenient. Once dispatched, there is a risk of being intercepted halfway and falling into destruction. As in the blind action on April 11 last year, the result was not only unsuccessful, but also suffered heavy losses and returned.</p>
<p>Careful Prevention to Ensure Everything is Safe</p>
<p>Although the US Air Force in Chongqing is weak, it may still be constantly preparing. The US Air Force in Chongqing was originally under the jurisdiction of the US Army Tenth Air Force in India. Recently, it was reorganized into the Fourteenth Air Force and became an independent unit directly under the command of the US Commander-in-Chief in Chongqing, India and Burma. This reorganization seems to be an indication of increased strength, so we must prepare to complete the air defense facilities in the peaceful area to ensure everything is safe. Although the current strength of the United States is still insufficient and it is difficult to commit peaceful areas, it is necessary to prevent it carefully.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Scheduled to Resume Traffic—This Month's 25th</h3>
<p>According to official sources, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line between a certain place on the south bank of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province and Jinhua is scheduled to resume traffic on the 25th of this month. A traffic opening ceremony will be held in Jinhua at that time. Once the Qiantang River Bridge is completely repaired in the future, the direct traffic between Shanghai and Jinhua is also expected to be realized.</p>
<h3>Collection Standards for Baojia Expenses in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Baojia Committee in this city, in view of the inconsistent collection of Baojia expenses in various districts, in order to establish the Baojia expense budget, the collection standard is specially formulated: 2 yuan per month for attached households, 4 yuan per month for regular households, 6 yuan per month for shop households, and appropriate handling for shack households and the extremely poor. It is reported that this method has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval by the committee.</p>
<h3>The Issuance of Residence Permits in Huxi Will Increase the Speed</h3>
<p>The Huxi District Residence Permit Office's review of applications for residence permits for mobile households is probably quite detailed. Therefore, residents often fail to obtain residence permits within half a month, even a month, or even longer, after completing the application procedures. According to inquiries, the office has realized the inconvenience of residents without residence permits and decided to complete the issuance of all residence permits that have not yet been issued in the near future and improve work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Cleared Areas: Area and Household Registration Statistics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Clearing Association's First Division has ordered the completion of the investigation of the area and household registration statistics of Chongming, Jiading, and Baoshan districts in the second phase of the cleared areas in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Commendation for Nanshi Self-Defense: There are indeed many members of the Nanshi District Baojia Self-Defense Corps who serve conscientiously, but a few members often perfunctorily evade their duties, which affects public security. Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Headquarters, personally inspected the area late last night and witnessed a self-defense corps member wading back and forth in the rubble late at night, conscientiously performing the duties of a park member, which is commendable.

<h3>Economic Circle</h3>
<p>Soybean cake has been actively traded recently due to the gradual movement of actual sales. In addition to the bulk shipments that have already been transported to Nanyang, 20,000 pieces have also been loaded for Tianjin and Qingdao a few days ago, but there are also many incoming goods.</p>
<h3>Commentary: The Boundary Between the Government and the Business World</h3>
<p>The government's recent promulgation of the order to thoroughly investigate speculative buying and selling and hoarding, with special attention to well-known financial institutions and those who occupy important positions in politics, shows the greatest determination and is worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>Now, those who rely on political status and financial power to manipulate the market and engage in large-scale speculation can be said to be scorned by passers-by and known to the whole country. According to the results of this secret investigation, many wealthy households often have huge amounts of fixed-term checks for payment and are suspected of being used for speculative hoarding. These people have been doing this illegal business for more than a day by relying on their power and using their strength. If the government can learn from the past and be wary of the evils of official-business collusion, then in the future, anyone engaged in finance and commerce must not be allowed to mix in politics and profit from it; those in the political arena must never invest in commerce or serve as directors, supervisors, and important positions in financial and commercial companies.</p>
<p>In short, we must achieve a state of "separation of officials and merchants" and strictly abide by the boundary; officials must never do business, and those who do business must never be officials. Government officials and financial tycoons must not privately invest capital and use clever names to allow their relatives and subordinates to compete with the people for profit. They must not use their position and power to provide opportunities for their relatives and friends to get rich. This is the most basic condition at present and the fundamental way to purify officialdom. We must never tolerate it again or indulge it again. Otherwise, once the opportunity is missed, the old habits will resurface, and there is a concern that the past abuses will be revived, or even intensified. Therefore, the root must be cut off today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Economic Circle: Designate Initiators of Ten Industry Associations, Deadline for Completion of Organizational Adjustment, Non-Association Member Businesses Limited to Cease Operations on May 1</h3>

<h3>Seeking to Reduce Manufacturing Costs, Determined to Maintain Coal Ball Price Limit</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of coal ball prices, it is understood that there is currently no possibility of raising them. The standard price limit of twenty-five yuan per load will be maintained permanently. Although manufacturing costs have increased slightly recently compared to the past, coal ball merchants have repeatedly discussed the matter with the Japanese representatives, seeking ways to reduce costs. The Japanese authorities have now dispatched personnel to Beijing specifically to negotiate lower prices in the production areas. Therefore, the rumor of rising coal ball prices is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Three Coal Ball Factories Repairing Machinery</p>
<p>In recent days, the amount of ready-made coal balls sold by retailers seems to have decreased slightly compared to a few days ago. The reasons for this are likely the following two points: (1) Yi Tai Xing, Dongfang, and Guohua, the three major coal ball factories, are all repairing machinery, resulting in a slight decrease in production volume. (2) People are generally anxious and uncertain, purchasing and stockpiling goods in preparation for unforeseen needs, leading to insufficient supply of ready-made goods in the market and causing misunderstandings. It is now reported that the machinery of the three factories will soon be fully repaired. Yi Tai Xing is scheduled to fully resume production and delivery of goods today, while Dongfang and Guohua will also resume operations from tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p>Abundant Raw Materials for Coal Ball Production</p>
<p>As for the raw materials (coal dust) used to manufacture coal balls, the current types are Jiaozuo dust and Heling dust. Jiaozuo dust comes from Hebei, and Heling dust comes from Korea. These materials are still suitable for manufacturing coal balls, and the supply is abundant. There is no concern about future shortages. The relevant authorities will distribute them fairly, and the factories will have enough for their needs. The remaining materials will be stored in warehouses for gradual sale.</p>
<h3>Banking Sector Discusses Eliminating Speculation and Hoarding</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities dispatched personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding by financial institutions, a certain merchant-run bank has been ordered to close, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the banking sector in the city, in order to assist the authorities in cracking down on hoarding and to implement a "self-discipline system" in the banking sector, will convene an important meeting within days to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the main issues to be discussed will be that in the future, no more funds will be lent to merchants who engage in speculation and hoarding. If any bank continues to collude with speculators and hoarders, or even directly engages in speculation and hoarding secretly, once verified, all banks will take the following three countermeasures as punishment: (1) all banks will cease all trade and dealings with that bank; (2) all banks will uniformly refuse to accept checks from that bank; (3) the bank guild will expel that bank from its membership.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Preparatory Members Selected for the Grains Industry Joint Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grains Industry Joint Association, after the Commercial Control General Association appointed Inoue Yasutada (acting head of Mitsui Bussan branch) as the Japanese representative in charge of preparations, and Fu Qian Geng as the Chinese director in charge of preparations, it was learned by this reporter yesterday that the association has now selected three Japanese preparatory committee members as follows: (1) Umezawa (Mitsubishi Corporation), (2) Suzuki (Gunbai-gumi), (3) Kurimoto (Ewa Trading). As for the Chinese preparatory members, they are currently being selected by the grains industry.</p>
<h3>Increased Stamp Tax Sales in Shanghai Special District Last Month, Reaching Over 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai – Since its reorganization this year, the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has made good progress in promoting tax policies, and tax revenue has increased compared to the past. After the original Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office was abolished, the bureau, in order to facilitate the purchase and affixing of stamp tax stamps and to eliminate the malpractices of the sales system, immediately dispatched personnel to cancel the sales system for stamp taxes. All merchants and residents in various industries can now directly purchase stamps from the bureau on Jiujiang Road. Therefore, the sales of stamp tax stamps have greatly increased. In particular, the Ministry of Finance's Tax Investigation Office has been strictly investigating tax evasion. In order to avoid penalties for failing to affix stamps, merchants in various industries have generally affixed stamps in accordance with the regulations. It is learned that in March of this year, the sales of stamp tax stamps in the Shanghai Special District increased to over 500,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 200,000 yuan compared to the sales in February.</p>
<h3>Director of North China Industrial Office Discusses Grain Management Issues in North China</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing, 15th – Wang Yintai, Director of the Industrial General Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission, represented the commission to participate in the third anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital and to coordinate with the Central China relations on adjusting the North China economy, transporting Central China food to North China, and other issues. Having completed his mission, he returned to Beijing and hosted a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters on the 14th, explaining the current food and price issues. He stated in general: (1) Regarding North China's food situation this year, efforts are being made to import food from Manchuria and Mongolia. An agreement has also been reached to import a considerable amount of flour from Central China. Therefore, a large amount of food can be imported from various sources this year, and the quantity will be greater than last year, ensuring a smooth supply and stable prices. (2) During wartime, everything must be subject to control. The authorities previously established the Materials and Price Handling Committee and the Food Administration Bureau to implement control. In the future, it is hoped that the public will provide more assistance to strengthen and expand the control work. (3) The National Commercial Control General Association has recently been established in Central China, so North China should also establish a controlled trading agency. The relevant departments have been instructed to start planning for this, and it should be established in the near future. The distribution of grain will also be handled by the Chinese side. It has been decided to entrust merchants with purchasing the grain, which will then be distributed by the Food Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Beijing Grain Bureau, New Director Discusses Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th –</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's meeting has approved the appointment of Liu Bo as the Director of the Beijing Grain Bureau. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him to inquire about the policy guidelines of the Beijing Grain Bureau. He stated that he felt deeply responsible for being appointed to the Beijing Grain Bureau, and that he would do his best to overcome all difficulties in the future. He would uphold the central national grain policy of the capital, following the instructions of Mayor Zhou, and devote himself to the work. In the wartime system, food is the lifeline of the country, especially in the capital. Therefore, he will devote all his efforts to increasing production, strengthening management, so that supply and demand are in balance, conserving consumption, so that distribution is reasonable, and enjoyment is equal. He will also strictly supervise the distribution, smuggling, and hoarding of aquatic products, livestock products, and all non-staple foods, beverages, seasonings, and substitute foods. He will also make it a priority to severely punish corruption and prohibit adulteration, so as to stabilize people's livelihoods, make society more prosperous, prevent social order from being disrupted, and allow everyone to focus on their respective positions to work together to complete the rear area work of the Greater East Asia War. It is also reported that the bureau will be officially established today (the 16th), and the Beijing Public Grain Committee will also be abolished.</p>
<h3>Price Issues and Free Economy</h3>
<p>— Uncle</p>
<p>In recent years, prices have been rising continuously, and citizens are suffering from increasing pressure on their lives, creating a sense of unease throughout the city. The reasons for price fluctuations are nothing more than currency and goods. The currency side includes the amount of paper money issued and the loans issued by financial institutions. The goods side includes the supply and demand situation of expensive goods.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the supply and demand situation. The impact of supply and demand on prices actually only refers to "effective supply and demand," that is, actual buying and selling in the market, which is related to prices. In recent years, production has been sluggish, the source of raw materials has been cut off, and those with funds have engaged in large-scale hoarding, so although there are large stocks, the "effective supply" is not smooth, and the "effective demand" has increased due to the prevalence of speculative psychology, so prices have soared.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about the situation on the currency side. General speculators often use the expansion on this side as an excuse. Looking at the facts, the amount of currency issued has not shown any signs of expansion, and the authorities have repeatedly clarified this. As for credit expansion, although there are no accurate figures to rely on, if we assume that there is indeed credit expansion, then the reasons for it are significant and require research. Whether the loans issued by financial institutions constitute credit expansion depends on the nature of the loans. If loans are issued to hoarders, it is credit expansion. If loans are issued to producers, it is not. Rising prices can be the result of credit expansion, but the latter is the result of speculative behavior. Therefore, although speculators can blame rising prices on credit expansion, they do not know that credit expansion is actually caused by their own behavior.</p>
<p>The root cause of rising prices is as described above. But is the ultimate source of rising prices limited to this? In other words, can the mismatch between the currency and goods sides cause prices to rise in any environment? The answer is no. The so-called rising prices due to the situation on the currency and goods sides, the biggest premise of this causal relationship is actually a free economic structure. Only under a free economic structure can improper loans lead to supply and demand imbalances, which can cause a general rise in prices. In other words, credit expansion, supply and demand imbalances, etc., are phenomena under a free economy. Using credit supply and demand, etc., as excuses for rising prices is rooted in the idea of a free economy. Looking around the world, there are many cases of supply and demand imbalances due to war, but their prices do not rise sharply like in our country, because there are reasonable and effective controls in the financial and material aspects. Then the so-called currency and goods sides that can cause prices to rise are actually the result of the free economic structure and the prevalence of free economic thought.</p>

<h3>Education of "Love" and "Beauty"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Speaking of self-cultivation, the education of these two kinds of love and beauty is not limited to educating "children." Throughout our lives, we cannot escape from these two kinds of education for a moment. The reason why the human world is so cold and dark now is because it lacks "love" and "beauty."</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: "Love" is the true meaning of "treating others," and "beauty" is the cultivation of "self" personality. The so-called "being human" is to enrich these two kinds of education in life, to lead mankind to the path of light, and to build the world that people dream of, we must start from the education of love and beauty.</p>
<p>In the Bible, Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you love me?" Now, let's ask everyone this question, "Do you love me?" The truth of this sentence is to ask oneself how much "love" one has. "Love" cannot be treasured privately; it should spread out like air. We grow up because we receive the love of our parents. We have the "friendship" of our friends, and we will succeed in our careers. From the beginning to the end of our lives, we are always growing in "love." We have received a lot of love from others, so how can you keep a part of yourself treasured? Can you imagine if all mankind could contribute "love" to each other, why would we still need to fantasize about heaven?</p>
<p>The education of "beauty" is the foundation of the education of "love." Everyone must have "beauty of the soul" in order to "love others." "Beauty of the soul" can cultivate a gentle character, pure thoughts, and whether in career, family, or among friends, one can achieve perfect success and generate the power to love others.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone who spends all day running around for money can take some time each day to sit down quietly. If possible, cultivate your "aesthetic sense," listen to some music, appreciate some paintings, read a few good books, and take this opportunity to educate yourself in love and beauty. Recall your daily life, correct your path, and after a long time, I believe it will grow a pure white lily in your life, giving you a pure and honest heart, so that you can taste the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, "How much love do I want, how much beauty do I have," and give it a satisfactory answer. This education must be borne entirely by yourself.</p>
<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>Nutrition is actually an economic problem!</p>
<p>In today's world of "rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia," many families cannot even afford vegetables and tofu, so how can they talk about nutrition?</p>
<p>The premise of nutrition is money. Without money, there is no point in talking about nutrition!</p>
<p>We poor kids can only sigh at nutrition.</p>
<p>The spread of tuberculosis is mainly due to people's lack of nutrition, and the crux of the problem lies in rising prices.</p>
<p>If we do not seek a fundamental solution, but only circle around on trivial issues, it is "abandoning the root and pursuing the branches."</p>
<h3>How to Stop Anger?</h3>
<p>— Bing Geng</p>
<p>We don't like to be with a person with a bad temper in society, because when we get along with him, we always make mistakes and often become his punching bag for no reason. On the part of the angry person himself, when angry, it can stop the digestive function, disrupt the nervous system, and in severe cases, even cause the liver to rupture and die. What's more, in a fit of rage, reason loses its dominance, and one can kill people for no reason, causing relatives and friends to turn away. Therefore, anger has no benefit for individuals or society, and if it is not controlled, it often causes endless harm.</p>
<p>Anger is one of the basic human emotions, and its power is very great. The method of stopping it is, first, to try to eliminate the causes that can cause anger; second, when it is about to erupt but has not yet erupted, use strong willpower to suppress it, so that it pulls back on the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>When we are angry, we always grit our teeth, clench our fists, and speak loudly and harshly. At this time, the most direct method of stopping it is to deliberately make the tone of voice softer, say each sentence more slowly, and try to relax the muscles that have already become tense. At this time, because the "state" of anger does not exist, anger will also disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>There are also several indirect methods of stopping anger. Such as: (1) temporarily leaving the environment that can cause anger; (2) silently counting numbers in the mind; (3) shifting one's attention to other places. If these methods are implemented properly, they will have great effects.</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>'What's the big deal.' Ah Wu wiped his face with his hand, wiping away the sweat and rain. 'That's so refreshing! The shameless one was acting up, saying "people from the team" are coming, and then ran away. I know "people from the team" well. It would be great if they came, but unfortunately they didn't...'</p>
<p>The merchants gradually gathered together, and everything returned to the way it was before the fight. Except for the children, most of the adults didn't mention the fight.</p>
<p>A load of tofu pudding was placed in front of them, and Ah Wu waved his hand and said: "Scoop two bowls."</p>
<p>The two had just finished eating, and Ah Wu shouted again: 'Add two bowls.' He added them three times in a row. After the last addition, Da Gen quickly stopped him and said: 'Don't add any more, you won't be full anyway. Wait until it gets dark, and come to my house for some snacks.'</p>
<p>Ah Wu paid with a smile.</p>
<p>The fog was still coming in waves, and the rain not only didn't stop, but turned from silk into lines. Some people were walking in the east and west directions, no longer standing there.</p>
<p>'It always rains in mid-March, so annoying!' Ah Wu said resentfully, 'We have to go back.'</p>
<p>With that, he and Da Gen walked westward side by side. They did not plan to take the same route they came from. When they passed the Doukou of the Old Lord's Temple, they did not go in. After passing the Old Lord's Temple, they simply went diagonally southwest, bypassing the Great Emperor's Temple behind a high mound, and landed on the branch of Lingshan Mountain extending southward at the western end. There were many people on this road. Not only did people from various towns in the west of Lingshan Mountain take this road, but also people from the south. (32)</p>

<h3>Seventh Place in the February Essay Contest – How to Read and What to Read? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ni Guizhang</p>
<p>2. Reading Methods for Each Subject</p>
<p>(1) Language: Knowledge in books is represented by characters. To acquire knowledge, we must first recognize characters. Whether it is the national language or a foreign language, the learning methods are generally similar. We know that to learn a language, we must read various works, carefully read excellent sentences, preferably memorize them, practice writing, and explain the meaning of the book. We must also study grammar, and understand the analysis of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs one by one. In addition, we must experience and carefully observe the social situation and the dynamics of the crowd. Then the ability to read and write will naturally improve.</p>
<p>(2) Philosophy, Logic, etc.: To seek the truth and to have a systematic way of thinking, we must seek this kind of knowledge. When learning, first, we should recognize the meaning of various nouns; second, we should collect examples for comparative research; and third, we should be able to apply them practically.</p>
<p>(3) Natural Sciences: Including physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, etc., to learn this knowledge, we must collect many specimens and do more experiments. We must also study how to control nature and use natural methods, so that there are new inventions and new discoveries, so that human life can be more in line with ideals.</p>
<p>(4) Social Sciences: Including history, geography, politics, economics, education, society, etc., when learning, we must have no prejudice and research everything with an objective attitude. We should try to answer practical questions and read more reference books and newspapers for verification.</p>
<p>(5) Mathematics: Including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, etc. When learning, in terms of psychology, we must not have the slightest fear; in terms of methods, first, we must understand the basic concepts; second, we must memorize theorems and definitions; and third, we must do more exercises.</p>
<p>The basic reading methods and reading methods for each subject mentioned above are simple and crude, and cannot fully cover all aspects of reading methods. However, I hope that people who like this book will consider the situation and apply it well.</p>
<p>What to Read?</p>
<p>We have used so many reading methods, so what exactly should we read? This is indeed a difficult question to answer. What's more, "Life is limited, but knowledge is unlimited." How can we read all the books in the world in this short life! Therefore, we feel that the books that a person should read can be divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Must-Read: Such as sports and hygiene, which can build up the body; citizenship and ethics, which can build up the mind; law and party principles, which can make good citizens; history, geography, current affairs newspapers, which can understand the times and be a person of the new era. Therefore, these kinds of books are necessary for everyone to read.</p>
<p>(2) Related to Occupation: Such as doctors, should read more physiology, anatomy, etc.; such as architects, must read aesthetics, art history, municipal administration, etc.; such as bank clerks, must read Chinese and foreign statistical reports, as well as books and newspapers on the status of materials, transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce; such as school teachers, must read education history, teaching methods, psychology, and mass education, etc.; so that the profession itself can be more advanced.</p>
<p>(3) Related to Interests: Such as those who like literature and art, read more new and old creations; those who like raising fish and birds, read more books on raising fish and birds; those who love photography, read more photography publications; those who like playing chess, read more books on chess.</p>
<p>As for students in school, in addition to understanding and comprehending all the textbooks, they must also read more extracurricular reading materials and reference books; in particular, they must read newly published magazines and newspapers to increase new knowledge.</p>
<p>Study hard!</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of space, I will not be able to explain the reading methods and the books that should be read in more detail. I sincerely hope that people in the world, regardless of gender, age, wealth, or intelligence, can recognize the purpose of reading, apply good reading methods, and work hard to read the books that are necessary, related to their profession, and in line with their interests, so that we can become reasonable and healthy people.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk About Writing</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, many people probably think it is very difficult.</p>
<p>That's right. Some people have a lot of ideas they want to express, but unfortunately they can't express themselves clearly, wasting their rich ideas. Some people's writing is fairly smooth, but unfortunately their writing is dry and they can't think of what materials to write about, which also lets down their talent.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as you are willing to concentrate, everyone can write. Of course, I am not saying that you can immediately write works of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of words. Here, you must first start with short articles. Before writing an article, you must go through a detailed consideration to understand what you want to say in the whole article, and then put pen to paper. At first, the writing should only be smooth, as long as there is nothing incomplete in the thought. Later, you will gradually pay attention to rhetoric and extension. If you can do this, you don't have to worry about not being able to write. There is only one thing to pay attention to. If you have not thought about it, or if you have nothing to say in your heart, then don't write. Some people usually have no writing skills or training, and suddenly, for some kind of need, they rashly pick up a pen and scribble, regardless of how bad or vulgar the writing is, regardless of how illogical the thoughts are. They just scribble, just wanting to get paid after filling a notebook with black things and sending it to print, but they never think that they have left a huge stain on literature. In the 17th century, there was an article in the work of the famous French writer La Bruyère that talked about this kind of person.</p>
<p>He said: 'A person, suddenly, without even thinking about it the day before, picked up paper and pen and said to himself: "I want to write a (book)!" He has no other needs except the need for fifty gold coins, that is, the ability to write. I shout to him in vain: "Go pick up a saw! Tiakqin! Saw! Or find some rubbing and grinding work to do, or make wooden frames for cars, and you will eventually get the reward you want!" He has not learned these crafts! "Then copy! Transcribe! Be a proofreader in a printing house! Please don't write!" But he wants to write, he wants to print, and because people usually can't send blank paper to print, he fills this notebook with what he likes to write. He casually writes sentences such as the Seine River flows through Paris, there are seven days in a week, or the weather is going to rain.' These sentences, in addition to making others habitually feel meaningless, do not cause any other disturbance to the public. So his wonderful work passed the examination and was printed, and it was republished in a situation that became a shame on the literature of this century and made those excellent authors feel ashamed of him.</p>
<p>How should we write? We must have extensive and profound life experiences, be tempered and tested by the great era, and use excellent literary skills to record them. Only this kind of writing is meaningful.</p>
<p>But, "A thousand-story platform starts with accumulated earth." We don't need to be afraid and dare not write.</p>
<p>Writing should only be cautious and sincere.</p>
<h3>Forget "Self"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xin</p>
<p>We often see two or more people arguing endlessly with red faces and bulging veins. What are they arguing about? Mostly to defend their own prejudices.</p>
<p>It is rare for the human heart to have peace and fairness. It is often biased, subjective, and arbitrary, whether towards a person, a thing, or a matter.</p>
<p>To consider correct and objective facts, one must forget the existence of "self." This is the most difficult thing to do, because everyone remembers "self" the most firmly!</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>A Good Way to Convert Gifts into Cash</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocity in etiquette is clearly stated in the classics.  When friendship is deep, gifts are inevitable, and this is a common practice, even expected in times of peace and prosperity. However, in these chaotic times, with refugees crowding the roads, it is unconscionable to hold lavish birthday and wedding banquets indoors, wasting resources invisibly, while outside, the cries of hunger and cold echo, and people struggle to survive. Such scenes are heartbreaking, and a benevolent person would not do it.  Furthermore, for weddings, funerals, celebrations, and new business openings, the gifts are often scrolls, banners, flower baskets, silver shields, and mirror stands.  Recipients then feel obligated to host elaborate banquets in return. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, guided by the spirit of mutual assistance inherent in humanity, advises all sectors of society that, during these extraordinary times, all gifts for weddings, funerals, celebrations, and new business openings should be converted into cash and donated to charity. This benefits and averts disaster for friends and relatives on one hand, and extends life and begs for survival for the poor and sick on the other. It's a win-win situation and a great act of kindness.</p>
<p>The other day, when the Shanghai Zhejiang-Shaoxing Hospital held its opening ceremony, the invitation letter issued by the hospital director, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, stated, "If you are so kind as to bestow a generous gift, please give cash instead."  Furthermore, on the back, the chairman of the board, Pei Yunqing, urged people to give cash instead of physical gifts, saying, "Now that the official opening date has arrived, to express our feelings of kinship, we request that those who are acquainted with the director and those who love and support our hospital should sympathize with our difficulties and exchange gifts of jade and silk for cash. Let us use these tokens of ceremony to provide practical benefits, so that the spring breeze can spread further, expanding Mr. Yuan's benevolence in bestowing kindness. Your support is greatly appreciated by our hospital." Five institutions were designated to receive the funds: the Shanghai Industrial Bank, Tongrun Qianzhuang, Zhongyi Trust Company, the Huizhong Bank Branch, and the Pudong Bank. As a result, more than 60,000 yuan was received.  This not only avoided wasting resources, aligning with the government's call to conserve materials, but also replenished the hospital's operating expenses, meeting the need for funding. This is worthy of emulation and is therefore highlighted to inform readers.</p>
