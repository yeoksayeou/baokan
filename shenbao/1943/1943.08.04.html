<h3>社評　論國際大局</h3>
<p>歐亞戰爭局勢日趨緊急之際，國際外交與政治上的活動，亦有日趨白熱化之勢，但是，在這種軍事以外的戰爭之中，很顯明的可以看出完全不同的兩種派系。一方面是以道義爲出發的外交與政治活動，另一方面却是以權術爲中心的勢利外交。這兩者，有如涇渭之判，從這裏可以觀測人心之趨向與國際局勢的前途。</p>
<p>從西方現局觀察，自從義大利首相黑索利尼辭職，法西斯黨解散以後，英美即利用時機，造謠生事，推進其外交陰謀。他們最生要的活動方向，現在業已判明者，首先常然是根據其錯誤的觀察，誤認墨氏之辭職爲義大利退出軸心之先聲，因而開始對義國新政府展開外交攻勢，企圖不戰而攫取地中海的霸權。繼之就利用權詐與謠言，向土耳共，西班牙等國伸展其煽亂的　手。然而，在這裏，我們至少應有兩點須加以認淸：第一點，是義大利的近事，是為着增强戰爭總力的表現，是在德國同意之下進行和工作，也就是安定南綫和預防西綫的緊急措置。因此，根本影響不到軸心國之團結，而明百事勢與利害的中立國，也決不會因此動搖的。英美間的活動，可說是完全沒有根據的。第二點，是英美木身的矛盾是永恒的，而目幾乎隨時要暴露出來，就以這次對義活動而言，羅斯福和邱吉雨所表示的方向，就顯出絕大的距離，前者主張山作戰常局同時業進外交活勁，後者則以爲和義國新政府「密切連絡」，乃是英國政府應爲之事，彼此之間在在露出矛盾與爭軋。因此，西西里的戰事，在最近已見得弛緩下來，英美的軍心］不能不因之動搖，當然，在爭得時問的條件之下，軸心國就會給他們應有的報答——重大的打擊。</p>
<p>從東方來看，以美國爲首的所謂太平洋反攻，顯然已經在友邦日木軍事上的猛烈反擊之下消沉下去了，而同時在英美所謂「反攻準備」聲中給予太平洋各族以有力的影響，提高東亞民族自尊心，而且堅定其最後勝利之信心的，却是友邦道義外交的新實踐。舉其犖犖大者：第一是上海租界之實行交還與撒廢治外法權之初步實踐，充分表現了中日兩國關係之劃時代的進步。第二是朝鮮小磯總督訪問滿洲國，在決戰準備下促進了滿鮮協力的關係。以上兩者，充分表現了東方三軸心國——日華滿協力關係的新階段，表現了三國對於今日友誼及未來合作的緊密勢態。我們應該認　，這種新關係，對於歐洲，對於地中海的戰局與政局，都有重大的影響。東方軸心之團結鞏固，是世界戰局中軸心國最後勝利的最有力的支柱。</p>
<p>東亞　心國之團結鞏固，及其對於世界戰局與政局的影響，同時表現在南洋諸國對日關係的新發展。自從友邦日本東條首相兩度南臨之後，日泰友誼與同盟關係，日見躍進，而緬甸獨立建國，亦已於八月一日實現，與我國收回租界，東西映輝，成爲柬洋近代史上一大佳話。緬甸本爲東方一獨立國家，與我國尤具親善關係。但自不列顚帝國侵略勢力深入印度，東印度公司變成印度的統治者之後，即進而　食緬甸，近百年來，爲英印政府所奴役，喪失共獨立自由。緬甸原有的中央政權，固早爲英國所取消，緬境各土王土侯及土司，亦先後被墜迫與奴役。直到大東亞戰爭以後，日本事軍勢力，着着西進，距開戰不過一季，席捲馬來半島，繼下新加坡，於是進而進軍緬甸，此「後印度」的大國，乃獲得解放，在緬甸民族新領袖巴　氏與友邦軍隊親密合作之下，着着推行新政。至木年初，巴莫氏訪問東京，繼又有東條首相之南行，獨立自主的機運已吿成熟，至八月一日乃正式在友邦日木的扶助之下，召集建國議會，成立獨立自主政府，推巴莫爲國家代表，委定內閣各大員。一面與日本簽訂同盟條約，一面向英美正式宣戰。緬甸介於印度與重慶之問，當此英美侵言一太平洋反攻」之時，在戰略上及政略上的重要性，無待贅述，緬甸夕獨立建國，自爲大東亞戰爭中東亞被壓迫民族一大勝利，亦即東亞軸心國一大勝利，其前途之成就，尙有未可限量者。</p>
<p>友邦日本道義外交之成功，尙在繼續邁進中，我國主權完整一，泰國恢復領土，緬甸獨立建國一一實現之後，菲律賓之獨立自由，其實現常亦僅爲時間問題，更可注意者爲在友邦日本的積極援助之下，由江特拉，鮑斯氏領導的印度獨立革命軍，不久即將舉行勝利的進軍，緬甸獨立及印度獨立軍之積極活動，對於所謂大英帝國王冠上之實石的印度，究將發生如何嚴重之後果，現在憶很易觀察。「末次總督」華維爾對印度前途之畏懼，巳可從最近對印度獨立派實行懷柔一點可以看到。英美在東亞慘敗之後，繼而西亞的慘敗又在開始了，那麽，他們對歐洲第二戰塲的夢囈的實際價値，就不能不遭到最大的折扣。說不定歐洲的大局，還要靠東亞民族之努力來決定，歐洲的哲學家久已盛傳「光自樂來」的預言，現在，快臨於實現的時期了！我們東方民族對於國際大局，應該抓住其眞實內容而加強努力，中日的協力，東亞軸心的團結，東亞十億民衆的合作，將是世界戰爭勝利的象徵！</p>

<p>柏林三日中央社電　德國新聞社特派員柏勒納稱：西西里前綫戰事之重心仍在中路，該路德·義軍在加畢西區猛烈反攻，終於塡半數日前爲敵軍所攻破之缺口一處，德軍之猛攻，完全出於敵軍意料之外，德軍佔領重要之高陳地一處，並奪獲大批戰俘與戰利品。尼科西亞區德防軍藉轟炸機之掩護，終於擊破向前挺進之敵坦克車，並以巧妙之側面包圍戰術，杜塞美軍陣　之歸路，在堅苦之戰鬥中，敵軍損失甚大。美加軍經最强之砲兵準備後，向里加爾蒲托之東西兩面發動攻擊，該二處之猛攻，均由南面發出，在里加爾蒲托之西進攻之敵軍，爲德軍之猛攻所擊退，死傷甚衆，同時里加爾蒲托以東由加軍擔任攻擊，則在德軍高處陣牠之前陷入泥沼中，遭德軍重武器破壞性强大之火力之打擊，　軍一部份設法暫駐於若干據點，與其後方交通斷絕述絡。喀大尼亞低　處，加軍在英第八軍之左翼加緊努力，由狄太諾流域　德軍山岳陣地挺進，敵軍企圖在狄太諾河之北岸建立橋頭堡，但此項企圓在德砲隊防禦火力之下完全崩潰。</p>

<h3>今夏太行山作戰　日軍獲偉大戰果　渝第二十七軍被擊潰華北日軍當局之談話</h3>
<p>北　三日中央社電　日華北派這軍加藤報道部長，特於一日下午三時就日軍此次夏季太行作戰，發表談話稱，日軍自七月十日起開始，對殘存於南部太行山之渝軍第二十七軍展開殲滅戰，迄已俘　　豫備第八師師長陳孝强以下幹部多人，收獲莫大戰果，刻仍繼續掃蕩中。於此作戰中最値注目者，厥爲中共軍之行動，彼等竟以此作戰爲良機，圖坐收漁利，乃於各處潛伏，邀擊疲憊敗逃之倫廿七軍敗殘部隊，予該渝軍莫大之打　。根據以事實已暴露共黨之（渝共合作）及（中國人不　中國人）爲標榜之眞相，更可知中共絕非爲建設中國，更非爲復興民族，惟藉抗日及民族戰爭之口號，以寺化東亞，達共野望而巳。此後　仍殷切希望有識之士，電醒抗戰之迷夢，了解東亞道義之精神，與吾等走入同一步調，世對阻害新中國發展之敵人，　決予重懲。</p>
<p>北京三日中央社電　據山西日軍前綫來電，現地日軍當局一日就日軍今及太行山作戰發表如次：山西現地日軍自七月十日起，與隣近友軍相協力，對山西省東南部陵川東方及東南方省培附近之渝軍第廿七軍（包括預備第八師第四十五師四十六師），加以攻擊。該第廿七軍前於今春太行山作戰時，即巳蒙受相當打擊，幸而免於被殲，其後仍潛伏於南部太行山內，企圖重建其基地，然其多數將兵巳失戰意而覺悟抗戰之毫無意義，希望投入和平陣　之心情日甚。日軍曾隱忍不動，以促其來歸，但因軍長劉進缺乏英斷，頑迷不悟，仍期保持其抗戰空名，日軍乃斷然加以膺懲，發動攻擊。自作戰開始以來，各路日軍冐酷暑，克服山地　難，到處予以兜捕殲退，或使其投降，或澈底肅淸，今已將第廿七軍擊滅，達到作戰目的。其問並曾迫擊逃逸中之預備第八師主力，除使其潰減外，並將該師師長陳孝强中將及弟四十六師一百卅六團團長郭佩德上校俘虜，收獲偉大戰果，於今士氣益旺。日軍對於希望參加和遝者，仍準備予以容納，並使之各得其所，同時對於執迷不悟者，亦決予以剿滅，又該次作戰名爲「十八夏作戰」云云。</p>
<h3>英美歧視義國新政府</h3>
<p>日新聞社接到墨索里尼首相突然辭職，義王接任三軍統帥，巴杜格里奧元帥就任首　的消息後，首先向柏林分社接通國　電話、聽取維馬的情形，二十七日夜向守山特派員探詢義國情勢，恰　義方對德發表義首相更跌的經過，因此獲悉義國內部的動向及　各國的反響如左：</p>
<p>本社：義首相更迭的理由何在？柏林沒有情報麼？</p>
<p>守山：二十七日義國當局方才經無綫電發表墨素里尼首相決憲引退的詳細經過。據稱二十四日午後，曾召集法西斯黨的敢後大會，齊亞諾。格　第·德波諾·雷倍基·斯古爾柴及其他法西斯黨領袖多　出席，歷時十小時，直至二十五日晨三時始行散會。格蘭第的提案要求墨索里尼交還陸海空三軍的指揮權於國王愛麥處限、依從憲法的規定請求裁可。該提案以十九對七的多數通過，致　索里尼首相卒不得日決意引退。當該案付表決時，前外長齊亞露亦投贊成票，頗堪注意、</p>
<p>巴爾幹方面</p>
<p>本社：木事件似已在各國引起種種反響，接近　國，與義國有密切關係的巴爾幹，有何影響？</p>
<p>守山：從報紙上所見的巴爾幹的反響，最先是匈牙利、二十七日各報讚頌墨素里尼氏爲義國所盡的功績，感謝等索里尼氏對匈牙利始終用親切的態度互相接近。這　政府機關報的意見，毫未涉及自己的意見。羅馬尼亞因與東部　綫接近的緣故，始終與德國步驟一致，無論義國有何事故，羅馬尼亞的態度不變。東部戰　在羅馬尼亞視爲是決定的要素，所以將忠實地信守和德國同盟的關係，至於保加利亞，　態度非常　重，視義國的政變僅爲內政事件，說到今後的情勢如何變化，尙還過早。報紙上雖然刋出了　索里尼，義王及新首相三人的照相，但毫未提及保加利亞的立塲，斯洛伐克視爲義國今後由國王統　後，國內的團結將更　鞏固，故與軸心1致的外交政策將不致有何變化，最後說到十耳其，其熊度非常愼重，以期避免昭入交戰國　方的策動。例如土耳其報紙的論調說，在前次大戰中，義國在加波烈東受到打擊，其後爲改　戰况而盡其最後的努力，這種情勢在此次的義國是整個的，所以現在義國的事件，無寗說是爲了擴大抗戰力而出以舉國一致抗戰的能度。</p>
<p>英美方面</p>
<p>本社：英美方面將乘此大爲宣傳罷！</p>
<p>守山：最先我想說的，乃是邱吉爾今日在英國議會作過於義國問題的演說。這是相當突兀的事的。英國　紙的論調，例如泰晤士報今日　載的新聞如此：</p>
<p>「新首相巴格杜里奧不過是墨素里尼政策的繼任者，老式的軍人，一般地說，是一點也沒有聲望的將軍」、</p>
<p>第一句先就攻擊人物，這必不是對義國新政權表示好　的言詞。泰晤士報後來又說：「此次義國政變，義國不是正在盡其最後的力嗎？一再說英美方面的態度，曾表示「但英美方面不問義國的熊度如何，共根本方針依然不變。」至於美國，大體也與英國一致，對巴格杜里奧新政權表示反對的意向。美國報紙所諭，說巴格杜里奧與　索里尼一樣是同一政節的蹈　者。結果，黑素里尼雖已隱去，但其影仍常出現，　索里尼與巴格杜里史同樣是我們的敵人。（翔：譯自七月，二十九日西部明日新聞）</p>

<h3>上海安老院參觀記　八十一歲女孩</h3>
<p>「老婆婆，多大高壽了？」</p>
<p>「嘻，小咧，小孩子，不過八十一歲，哈哈！」</p>
<p>閃着銀光的髪絲襯托出紅澗的顏面。多麼壯傳活潑、那被收養在安老院的繁　很高興地答復記者關於住院的感想、「還有大姊姊們咧，她們有的來這裏已經二十多年的關於院裏的故事，講幾天也不會講完呢·總之一旬話•進得這扇門，福分眞不小，前世不知如何修行呢。你看，這裏，那位不是强强健强的？就是有幾位病了，姆姆們扶持得多麼週到？當有百萬，也不見得兒媳能如此孝奉哪，就是一天上主召喚囘去•也是是快怏樂業的，這，一來要謝天主的恩典。二來要謝院長姆姆，從外國趕來扶養窮老人，三來更要謝姆姆小姐姐……」眞健談，幾乎每一位老人都豪快和高興地和記者談話。</p>
<p>三百五十多個來自全國各地的老人中·男的二貞多，女的一百五十多，有過一百多歲·現在八九十　的還不少．看來最大多數是很　　的·這要歸功於安老院辦理的完善與姆姆們服務的週到·每天的生活都有秩序，淸晨起來散步游玩，中飯前後·體力特別健康的就幫着洗衣或淸潔房宇，栽培蔬菜，女老人，還特備有舊式紡車等，或藉此工作以代消遣，另有戰縫間，任便自己修補衣服，但以消蹧爲主。不求甚麼工作成績。老人們大都以幫助工作爲榮，不計她做，反而不快樂的不少。有一位從發生外間竊賊進院倫盜事件之後，自吿奮勇，終夜巡遲，那老女衛士的矯健的姿態，給人永不泯忘的印象。</p>
<p>院裏除了休息室．散心室等之外另有浴室等設備，有些體力差的，還得由姆姆等持扶入浴。爲着一般病患者的需要，又設完善有病房，病床被褥，一律潔白無垢，有修女書夜輪班看　，這裏的男婦老人，　食　潔，全由修女扶助，其中有一個七八十歲的老婆　在病味，正有一位剛由徐　女中舉業邀院的　書　　　在她床頭小心翼翼地　她流性食物，旁邊還有修女　姆們照願着問候着。使人想起電影中侍候皇太后進餐的一幕，也使人感到自己對於父母及一般老人的輕慢而中心刺痛，</p>
<p>安老院裏有不少　，瞎，跛，　的殘廢者，對於這些老人的養護，需要更大的耐性，除了物質上的滿足之外，還要給以精　的安慰。每當禮拜的日子，由病車送到特　的　道處，使聆夫全的福音·一個曾在美華即書館主特印刷部的盲目老人傾訴他，如何僥倖得進安老院，如何得受聖洗以及今日的樂觀，他已恢復童年的天眞，說話是那麼感人，他已不是盲子了，看得世界那麼深澈。</p>
<h3>修女的生涯與憂鬱</h3>
<p>人問天堂的上海安老院，完全由天主敎修女們主持着，原來的院長姆桐嘉庇額兒，是比利時人，現因故不克在院，另由一位典型的天主敎條女法國人賴芬額兒代任院長姆姆，她來華服務日有悠長的歲月，對記者表示為中國孤苦無吿者服務是最有福的行爲，覺得十分高興，修女姆姆三十二人，她們一向矢志守貞，誦經修這為老人服務，不與外界接觸。近年來國外捐助來源斷絕，就不能不向外奔走勸導。除了兩位專募食品之外，由唐德，張哲，賽利加和蔣姆姆等幾位修女專司募款，就在這樣炎　的天氣，也不得不終日在街頭奔走為老人向慈善人士勸募。在院服務的修女姆姆，西班牙人，法蘭西人，以及其他外國人不少，她們都願長期在華服務。練習姆姆三十餘人，全要工作是侍奉男女老人，大多數是徐匯女中的畢業生，一部份出身於外埠敎會女校，有的是富室嬌女，有的是小家碧玉，都巳矢志守貞，以修道服侍無告的老人爲終身事業，也許是「聖靈充滿一的緣故，她們越侍奉毫無關係的貧苦老人，越是感到愉快，每一個都是笑容可掬地對待老人像對自己慈愛的父母一樣，其中的一位說，她們進院以後，就不能再何自已原來的家庭，因為她們已獻身於宗敎慈善事業了，但每月還可接見從老家來的親人們，表示不完全忘却了人情。她們除了工作之外，還進附設在院的「初學院」學習做修女姆姆及服務老人的技能。</p>
<p>修女為自己的事業之成就而愉快，但是在今日她們已按抑不住心頭的憂鬱、因為院裏的資金已吿　竭、伙食時　斷絕，今年春天，曾請求上海市貧病救濟協會補助，得眩會業」，自三月份起，按月補助五千元共三個月，至六月間，又得一次補助一萬五千元，使他們稍展愁，一面糧源垂絕，她們的憂鬱，仍是日深一日。唐姆姆說，安老院除了院合自建之外，毫無基金與生人的食糧問題，以每月計，至少需要五十五　，能從糧食管理局。到的，不過十二袋，其餘五分之四需要另　張羅，此外，每月需謀約土噸，油九十斤，鹽二百五十斤，豆頗三百斤，鹹魚六白五十斤。菜頗一千五百斤，和肥皂　箱，布類至少約二十疋、其他開支，以七月物信計每月尙需付電燈費二百三十元，自來水二百五十元，藥品約一千二百元。修女　十餘人所吃的麺包約三千元，每月至少要二萬元的支出。然而，她們終日奔走勤募化零爲整，所得還不是十分之一。曕念途，也無怪赤誠服務的修女們　入格度的憂鬱中了。她們說，地們歡迎大批的損款，但也歡迎零星的濟助，無論是現金，舊衣破布，食品和日常用品，都很需要，除了機廠街三十九號該院之外，申報和新聞報的社會服務欄，也代該院收款。「老吾老以及人之老」、是我國固有的美德，願上海各大善士充分發揚這種美德，共同維護這人間的天堂上海安老院。（完）</p>

<h3>評言　防禦思想毒素</h3>
<p>汪主席前天招待本巿新聞記者談話中，主張澄淸不同見解，防禦思想毒素。主席說：「止海有五百萬民衆，經濟，文化，教靑思想，極爲龐雜，……如果專用悄極方法，加以禁止，使不能見於文字，是無效的。」這句骷眞不媿爲明照萬里！舉一個例來說罷，自從上海的報章雜誌，禁絕披露金融商業行情以來，日常物價的高漲如故，商業行市的奔騰如故，一切黑市價格的掀風作浪如故。</p>
<p>全席說到防禦思想毒素，曾經把經濟思想，放在第一，實在因爲上海人民經濟生活之苦痛，莫非由於經濟思想毒素所造成。什麼是經濟思想毒素？最普　的就是物値看高，幣値看低的心理，其次就是祗願個人發財，不顧國家利益的心理。這些思想毒素，不是不能悄滅的，祇是悄滅的方法與步驟，如何方爲合理？如何方爲有效？</p>
<p>假定上海人民的經濟思想還是中毒未深的話，就得火速進行消毒，因為防毒好像是巳經有些緩不濟急了。</p>
<h3>常局決心整飭　區內金融工商業　短期間澈底根絕囤積投機</h3>
<p>本市兩租界經我國常局先後敢囘後，第一第八兩區公署亦已設立完竣，現正積極建立內部機構。並逐步改革過去租界在行政上之弊端，大約在三數月後，舊租界之面目必可掃除凈盡。至對於第一第八兩區內之金融工商各業，有關當局鑒於過去因受租界之阻礙、管理不易、流弊滋多，致造成金融機關之投機囤積，及工商各業之操縱抬價，經營黑市。茶毒民生，實非淺鮮。印在租界業已收囘，行政已臻統一，有關當局對於過去弊端，予以澈底整舫，對於銀錢榮方面，今後將由財部與本市有關各機關密切合作，逐步加緊監督，對於工商各業第一步爲實行全面的淸查，務使任何方面不再國積物資，私抬物價。第一步爲普通推行生產與消費的配給制度，使工商界不能攫取非法利潤。頃悉，政府最高常局對於上述種種，異常關切，在短期間內必以嚴厲手段，壓平物價，幸本市工商各界速自檢點，不再經營投機國積之不法業務，以免日後後悔莫及也。</p>

<h3>保權杯圓門球義賽　紅隊六對四大勝西聯　苦齋主人三萬元購義球</h3>
<p>保權工藝廠爲籌募新聞報貸學金及申報助學金，發起舉辦保權盃圓門球義賽。於昨日下午五時，在光夏中學球塲隆重揭幕。周邦俊及王德全親臨致開幕詞及主持行開球禮。賽至中途。拍賣賽球，結果大善士苦　主人以三萬元成交，仁風可嘉。女子首先登塲，西聯獲球來犯，勃羅基越開直上，猛力急擲。中　守將史瑞娟疾命力撲，化險爲夷。未久中聯突起反攻，王福芝百步穿揚，建功而返。西聯羣英雖圖掙扎，無奈力不從心，上半時中聯以一對〇佔先。擇地再戰，西女傾師來犯，斯瑪基乘虛進竄，中聯史瑞娟一時大意，球應聲入網，媾成和局。未及七分鐘，中聯黃明媛發　圓强，攻入一球，遂以二對一奠定勝局，厭岫戲開始，裁判張覺非，紅隊包松圓單騎深入，惜足踏白綫，被審無効，徒勞往返。三分鐘之際，西聯凱捷密洛夫高　攻入，紅隊何孝光誤入禁區，罰六碼球，凱捷密洛夫操刀，一對〇西　佔先。十二分鐘時，樊慶成截得來球即告命中，一對一媾成半手。戰局漸趨緊張，李垚在人　竄力，力投得中，未幾于浮斯茵立還　色，爾後李垚再度　郞建功而返。西　不甘久蠻，沙司金冷箭射中，成三對三結束前半時，擇　再戰，紅隊李垚果然不凡，述中二球，西聯久戰力盡，　形不支，包松圓錦上添花，以六對三佔絕對優勢。離終塲二分鐘，沙司金攻入一球，紅隊以六對四大勝西聯。</p>

<h3>接收租界後的　上海政治問題</h3>
<p>— 張一冲</p>
<p>用政治的力量整頓物從　非常時期的物價，固然是由於供需的不平衡，資源的缺乏、或者說是通貨膨漲、…但我們要認淸、物價的漲落、並不是完全基於以上的原因；而是奸商們的把持、操縱、投機、囤積。投機與囤積的心理，或者亦可以說是由於德國馬克的心理所驅使、以為中國此時的通貨與馬克無異。要知道當時德國在第一次歐戰後，馬克的膨脹，初是自然的，後來便是國家政策的結果，是悄滅因戰爭而發國雖財的大資本家，是矩期的淘汰政策來挽敕民衆因此點看來，更覺這一般沒有國家觀念奸商的可憐。所以潧些社會上的罪魁，政府應該用淤底的政治力量，予以明朋化，</p>
<p>政府更應該有決心，澈查囤積與抑平物價，不能放鬆，亦是常前急待解決的嚴重問題，亦可說是現代政治經濟的組織不完備，而不能迎合目前的趨勢。</p>
<p>用政治的力量根絕烟賭自從鴉片戰爭發生之後，英人把大量的毒品輸入中國以筏，因爲當時滿淸政府的腐收，而有辱國條件的產生。百年來的奇恥大辱，今天可以說是洗凈了。但是鴉片的　毒，却仍留在民間，烟館遍　各地、數十年來努力禁毒的結果，還是沒有辦法、言來眞是痛心。鴉片旣不能　絕、迫踪而來的上海大賭窟仍舊存在、算來已經是五六年的歷史了，在　五六年中，社會罪惡的促成，眞是言不勝言，說不勝說了，當局沒有決心，特殊勢力便一天天的漲大起來，造成今日根深蒂固的局面。</p>
<p>要知道一般人民對於收囘租界的期待，與相絕烟賭的期待同機的熱烈、希望政府在上海施政計劃中。有强大的政治力量來消減「烟」和「賭」，完成眞正的主權獨立和修明政冶。</p>
<h3>底層階級的諒解和合作</h3>
<p>— 費念仁</p>
<p>國府還都以來，屈指巳有三四個年頭，在政治上，軍事上，以及經濟上；很得日本的諒解和協助。但這僅是政府與政府的諒解，又可說是上層階級的諒解。</p>
<p>所謂「政府」者，是確行人民意見的代表機　。因此：要使政府堅强，非要人民一致擁護不可：要使政治推進，也非要人民協助不可。而今日政府是否已代表和確行全體民意呢？而現在的人民是不是全體赤誠擁護利熱烈協助呢？</p>
<p>國府根本政策，推　上的困難，可以說是因爲中日二國底層階級人民的不能諒解。一方面當然是中國人民對於日木尙有傳統的誤解，另一方面，也是日本人民的行爲，有糾中國人的傳統習慣抵觸之處。這些在用政治的全體眼光來觀察，雖是使小。而却是人民切身的痛苦因此，對於人民的心理影響也甚爲重大。所以希望今後中日雙方間的親善由上層而擴大及於底層階級。</p>

<h3>杜先生</h3>
<p>— 愈若文</p>
<p>公務員杜先生突然　察有一個靑面獠矛的寃鬼正從後面追來，拿了一根又長又大的又子準對着他的後腦直刺；他像落了魄似的只顧狠命逃，逃，但只覺得腿部一陣軟，驀地跌倒在地上了。</p>
<p>他　　恐懼到了極點的心慢　地睜開眼來，才知道他原是跌在溫暖的被窩中：剛才祇不過是一個惡夢而已，、但是那顆心却依然忐忑得厲害。好像在極力掙扎要躍到外重來似的。他伸起左手來輕輕按住胸脯，被祿外面黯淡的燈光乘隙竄進被窩，映進他的眼簾。</p>
<p>杜太太正在一角洗臉，　見床上的被窩一勸，就知道他的丈夫已經醒T，略略皺了　眉頭，似平在悔恨自己絞手巾的聲音太　了，因之鬧醒了丈夫。不是麼，這時候　了隱隱聽得出的外面的籥滴聲之外，房間裏就祗有這絞面水的聲音是最　了。</p>
<p>「靑雲，時候還早呢，可以再睡一會兒，待我做好了早養，我來叫你吧！」</p>
<p>杜太太向杜先生軟聲說，一面就帶了護子面盆走到樓下去了。</p>
<p>杜先生朝杜太太的背面看了一眼，輕輕嘆一口氣。二隻手在床上一撑，身子就坐了起來，聽日杜太太在樓梯上沉重的脚步聲，又唉了一聲，輕輕地自言自語地說：「唉，惠波也太辛苦了，我眞對不住她！」</p>
<p>杜先生這話是出於心底的。十五年以前，常他在學校裏念書的時候，認識了柳惠波——現在的大太——那時候她是一個前進的女學生，熱情，耐勞，健美。杜先生當時也正是一個英俊的靑年，他們寫作－雙小花貓似的愛愛　着，從不肯　她操心勞力；後來有了愛情的結品一傭人——個奶媽，一個娘娘——這是用不着她　勞。杜先生雖然沒有甚麼家產，但是他　校的一年中就　進了郵政局，當了公務員，當時的俸給是很足夠應付他們這個小家庭的，他們計　着未來的送，覺　光明幸福！杜先生也相當節儉，十幾年來，倒也積上了約有二三萬了，預算再過十年，就是拿些利息也足夠供他們開支了，那時候他就預備和他的太太一同去過天南地北的旅行生活了——這是杜先生約時想。</p>
<p>但是啊，戰爭打破了他們的計劃，被滅了他們的理想。生活程度飛般上漲，十幾年來的積儲巳完全在「貼補家用」中化盡了。下個　人固然早已歇辭，四個孩子的衣食等項就由太太自理。本來住着的統樓也不得不退了租，搬進這狹小的亭子間裏來了。</p>
<p>杜先生想到這裏，禁不住望了望這鴿範般的房間，猛覺察一盞五支光的電燈還亮着，「啊　」杜先生一急：「我竟忘了扭滅電燈，要是給二房東看見了，太淸早開電燈，不是又要鬧是非了麼？」他急急伸過手去扭滅電燈，或　是太慌張了吧，睡在他一頭的項小的　實　　了。照例，這寶寶先是「爸爸媽媽」亂叫，　就「我要這，我要那」的亂　，睡在脚跟頭十二歲的第弟和九歲的妹妹都被吵醒f。杜先生一看不能再留在床上了，就跨下床來，抱起了寶寶，替他穿衣着襪，這孩子近來瘦得多了「唉，營養不足，營養不足！」杜先生痛苦地嘆一口氣。這時候他突然想到了他的最大的兒子明生。明生因為　着肺病，住在鄕下的男父處療養，已經有二個年頭了。據最近　次的來　說，明生的肺病　害愈厲害了，杜先生的心顫動了：「要是明兒有甚麼三長二短，那我怎麼對得住他啊，對得住惠波啊，這完全是營養不足所致啊！」</p>
<p>等到三個孩子穿好衣，洗過臉，房間裏　整理淸爽，杜太太的早餐也做好了，她端上來一碗黃荳牙，一碟子醬瓜和二包黃荳，再一碗一碗替孩子們盛粥。</p>
<p>項小的買賣首先爬上臬子，一看見這幾雙舊榮，就大嚷着：「爸爸，我不要吃這些菜，我要買肉饅頭吃、肉饅頭吃！」</p>
<p>「乘乖的，肉設頭吃了要肚皮痛的，咱們吃熱的粥，明日爸爸帶你到大世界去吃錕飩麵，看猢猻做把戲！」</p>
<p>被這一驅默默地坐下去了。</p>
<p>「爸爸，學校衷先生說，這一期的學費無論如何要繳了，假使冉不繳，先生叫我和妹妹不要再去讀書了。」</p>
<p>十二歲的弟弟剛喝了一口粥，忽然想起了這件事，就向着他爸爸說。</p>
<p>「嗯！」村先生不動聲色，祇在喉嚨裏嗯了一聲可是剛正杜先生在計劃怎樣去弄鈿來付學費，付房鈿，買些富於維太命的東西來給寶寶吃，樓下忽然來了急促的報告：</p>
<p>「快信！杜先生有快信！郵差在門口要圖章！」</p>
<p>杜先生放下亞碗飛奔下去。不滿二分鐘，杜先生已經面如土色拿了已經拆開的信箋上來了。他把信箋拋向太太，一面顫聲說：「惠波，妳看，鄕下一來的快信，說明兒巳經快不中用了……」]</p>
<p>「什麼？」杜太太眼哐裏頓時塞滿了淚水。</p>
<p>「我得就去，下鄕去！」杜先生披上衣服，快步走了。</p>
<p>「可是……你沒有告假……你得去局辦公，你有公事……杜太大追到門口，發抖地說。</p>
<p>「管不得「公事」了！」</p>
<p>在濛濛的細雨中，這是柱先生的回答。</p>
<h3>書匠子弟</h3>
<p>— 章祖爕</p>
<p>龍兒今年十一歲了——正是個讀書的時光；可是龍見並不曾上校去！</p>
<p>龍兒讀過一年書，是在七歲那一年。他家剛打家鄉搬到上海來，一到上海，龍兒就給那廣闊的馬路；飛駛的汽車，電車，以及黃包車，脚踏軍，高大的建築物；紅頭阿三；閃呀閃的霓虹燈弄得目炫了。不過這些在龍兒的心目中祇覺是得是新　好玩；並不曾發生過羡慕。羨慕的該是同他年齡相若的孩子了。他瞧着他們一早背着個書包，跳牙跳的，嘴裏哼着歌，由個　人陪着上校去了。一到校。立刻放下書包；往操塲上一跳，約幾個同學，拍拍皮球，眞是樂意！</p>
<p>突然一陣鈴聲。於是他看着他們急急地放下皮球，魚貫地奔進了敎室，坐在矮橙上，聽那個笑瞇　的先生講個奇怪故事；取是由那先生敲着「咚咚叮」的長箱子，孩子們跟看在下面張開了嘴，直着喉嚨「寶呀　的」唱起來；唱過後，翻開書來，再「大羊跑，小羊跳……」地讀起來。這…這眞開心　了！</p>
<p>龍兒偷偷地瞧過三四囘；熱烈地羨慕心也跟着每次的偷看而進展到沸點一。終於在一天的下午，龍兒忍不住了。乘媽高興的時候提出了要求。「媽！我要上學去！……別人家的孩子全上學的！」龍兒厥起了嘴，帶點兒撒嬌形態。</p>
<p>「好！停會兒我跟爸說去！」媽撫撫龍兒的頭髪，愛憐的說。</p>
<p>當晚，龍兒睡在牀上，聽得媽跟爸說：「龍兒年紀不小了，亦讓他上學去哩！」</p>
<p>爸「噯」的嘆了口氣；龍兒的心也隨着「下」的一跳；於是將個身體繫縮在孩角裏，用心地去聽着爸的「判決」。一書本該讓他去讀了；但那兒來的學費呢？……我是個小學敎師，收入不豐，糊口已感不易，何携還要加上這筆負担！……好在剛　習，在家自己敎敎也行！」</p>
<p>龍星差點哭了出來；但一聽媽又在說了；「龍兒自己跟我說過要讀書孩子歡喜讀　總是好的，你就讓他去吧！……明天你去同校長去商量，可不可以减費……你是個敎師，成天地在敎孩子，難道自己的孩子反而讓他失敎？」</p>
<p>爸想着覺得不錯：「也好！明天我跟校長商量去！」</p>
<p>一商量，龍兒的希望實現了。一早，也是背着個書包·讓爸携着，一跳一蹤地上學去了！</p>
<p>可是祇一年——短短的一年龍兒仍失學了！</p>
<p>隨着生活費用的上漲，爸實在負担不了這筆學費——雖祇半費！龍兒是　明的，是個可敎之材；但看他一年中就考了二囘第一名便知道了。但現在為了繳不出學費·却祇好呆在家裏！</p>
<p>龍兒為了這，哭了整是哭有甚麼用？付不出學是一個甜密的囘憶而已！</p>
<p>不過，龍兒有時替爸想想，實在他不能再去讀書了。單看家裏由二飯一粥，變成三餐粥、再變成二餐粥•，粥由厚的變成薄的，由再薄的燒成像開水一般地就明白了。</p>
<p>龍兒想請爸在家裏敎敎；可是爸每天囘來·總帶若一大疊卷子，改完了卷子，夜巳深沉，還是讓爸睡吧，趕明兒還得起早！爸得不到片刻的休息，生活鞭策他成天的在工作，以致人也瘦得不成樣兒。這樣，即使稍有空閒，龍兒也不忍去利用這惟一的機會——請爸教書！</p>
<p>龍兒的書包，現在在裝米。龍兒成天忙着的是替媽打雜差！龍兒有幾囘也問過媽：「媽！我幾時再好上學？」</p>
<p>「大槪明年吧！」媽說。但到了明年，龍兒還是在打雜差！再問媽。媽的囘答還是明年！</p>
<h3>舵手的歌</h3>
<p>— 白璧</p>
<p>在淸期的早晨，揚起了白帆，伴風前進，馳進人生的滄海·小波鼓　，好像在和你微淸風，徐來，如同撫慰你散左右，的小島向你誘惑，引你前來遊玩。注意！舵手！不要顧了須臾的快樂。轉變了你的船舵，錯走了你的航路。你要知道：那美處小鳥的周圍，潛隱着多少的暗礁，前進吧　莫猶豫，依着你旣定的航路直向你的目標前進！</p>
<p>夕陽欲傾，鳥雲東起，風，狂暴起來了！浪，怒吼起來了！如同沒有達到目的之惡寃，想把你吞食下去，狂風，好像要吹破你的帆，巨浪，如同要擊破你的船手。舵手！舵手！</p>
<p>堅持，鎭靜，勇敢決心。</p>
<p>握住了你的舵，不要怕，切艱難，切障碍，前進吧！莫猶豫，照着你旣定的航路，直向你的目標前進！黑暗過去，光明重來，萬籟安靜，</p>
<p>海鷗，又在忙着尋找早食，</p>
<p>目標，已能遙遠的眺望，風，又來撫順你的散</p>
<p>浪，又給你甜媚的微笑。舵手！舵手！本着你過去的精神，堅持最後的幾分鐘，前進吧！記住：只要努力就能成功，只要奮鬥終能勝利！</p>

<h3>Editorial: On the International Situation</h3>
<p>As the situation of the European and Asian war becomes increasingly urgent, international diplomacy and political activities are also intensifying. However, in this war outside of military engagement, two completely different factions can be clearly discerned. On one hand, there are diplomatic and political activities based on morality, and on the other hand, there is opportunistic diplomacy centered on power politics. These two are as distinct as the Jing and Wei rivers. From here, one can observe the trends of people's hearts and the future of the international situation.</p>
<p>Observing the current situation in the West, since the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the dissolution of the Fascist Party, Britain and the United States have seized the opportunity to spread rumors and advance their diplomatic conspiracies. The most important direction of their activities, which has now been clarified, is, firstly, based on their erroneous observation, mistaking Mussolini's resignation as a prelude to Italy's withdrawal from the Axis powers. Therefore, they began a diplomatic offensive against the new Italian government, attempting to seize hegemony in the Mediterranean without a fight. Subsequently, they used trickery and rumors to extend their inflammatory hands to Turkey, Spain, and other countries. However, at least two points should be clearly recognized here: Firstly, the recent events in Italy are a manifestation of strengthening the overall war effort, carried out with the consent of Germany. It is a measure to stabilize the southern front and prevent emergencies on the western front. Therefore, it does not fundamentally affect the unity of the Axis powers, and neutral countries that understand the situation and their interests will not be shaken by it. The activities of Britain and the United States can be said to be completely unfounded. Secondly, the contradictions within Britain and the United States are perpetual and almost always exposed. Taking this activity against Italy as an example, the directions expressed by Roosevelt and Churchill show a great distance. The former advocated simultaneously advancing diplomatic activities while conducting military operations, while the latter believed that "close contact" with the new Italian government was something the British government should do. Contradictions and competition are evident everywhere between them. Therefore, the battle of Sicily has recently slowed down, and the morale of the British and American armies cannot but be shaken by this. Of course, given the opportunity to gain time, the Axis powers will give them the due reward—a major blow.</p>
<p>Looking from the East, the so-called Pacific counter-offensive led by the United States has obviously subsided under the fierce counterattacks of the friendly Japanese military. At the same time, it is the new practice of moral diplomacy by friendly nations that has given a strong influence to the various ethnic groups in the Pacific amidst the so-called "counter-offensive preparations" of Britain and the United States, raised the self-esteem of the East Asian nations, and strengthened their confidence in final victory. To cite a few prominent examples: Firstly, the actual return of the Shanghai concessions and the initial practice of abolishing extraterritorial rights fully demonstrate the epoch-making progress in the relationship between China and Japan. Secondly, Korean Governor-General Koiso's visit to Manchukuo promoted the relationship of cooperation between Korea and Manchuria in preparation for the decisive battle. The above two fully demonstrate the new stage of cooperation among the three Eastern Axis countries—Japan, China, and Manchuria—and demonstrate the close situation of friendship and future cooperation among the three countries today. We should recognize that this new relationship has a significant impact on the war situation and political situation in Europe and the Mediterranean. The solidarity and consolidation of the Eastern Axis is the most powerful pillar for the final victory of the Axis powers in the world war situation.</p>
<p>The solidarity and consolidation of the East Asian Axis powers and its impact on the world war situation and political situation are also manifested in the new development of the relations between the Southeast Asian countries and Japan. Since the friendly Prime Minister of Japan, Hideki Tojo, has visited the South twice, the friendship and alliance between Japan and Thailand have been advancing rapidly. The independence and nation-building of Burma was also realized on August 1, echoing our country's recovery of the concessions, becoming a great achievement in modern history of the South Seas. Burma was originally an independent country in the East and had a friendly relationship with our country. However, since the invasion of the British Empire penetrated into India, and the East India Company became the ruler of India, it further encroached on Burma. For nearly a hundred years, it has been enslaved by the British Indian government, losing its independence and freedom. The original central government of Burma was long ago abolished by the British, and the various local kings, dukes, and chieftains in Burma were also successively persecuted and enslaved. It was not until after the Greater East Asia War that Japan's military strength advanced westward. Within a season of the start of the war, it swept across the Malay Peninsula and then conquered Singapore, then advanced into Burma. This major country "behind India" was liberated. Under the close cooperation between the new Burmese leader, Ba Maw, and the friendly army, new policies were steadily promoted. At the beginning of this year, Ba Maw visited Tokyo, followed by Tojo's visit to the South. The opportunity for independence and autonomy was ripe. On August 1, with the assistance of friendly Japan, the National Assembly was convened to establish an independent and autonomous government, appointing Ba Maw as the national representative and appointing the major members of the cabinet. On one hand, it signed an alliance treaty with Japan, and on the other hand, it formally declared war on Britain and the United States. Burma is located between India and Chongqing. At this time of the Anglo-American invasion of the "Pacific Counter-offensive", its strategic and political importance is self-evident. The independence and nation-building of Burma is a great victory for the oppressed nations of East Asia in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a great victory for the East Asian Axis powers. Its future achievements are still immeasurable.</p>
<p>The success of the friendly moral diplomacy of Japan is still advancing. After the realization of the integrity of our country's sovereignty, the restoration of Thailand's territory, and the independence and nation-building of Burma, the independence and freedom of the Philippines is only a matter of time. Even more noteworthy is that, with the active assistance of friendly Japan, the Indian Independence Revolutionary Army led by Chandra Bose will soon launch a victorious advance. The independence of Burma and the active activities of the Indian Independence Army, what serious consequences will be caused to India, the "jewel in the crown" of the so-called British Empire, is now very easy to observe. The "last Governor-General" Wavell's fear of the future of India can be seen from the recent appeasement of the Indian independence faction. After Britain and the United States suffered a disastrous defeat in East Asia, followed by the beginning of a disastrous defeat in West Asia, the actual value of their dreamy talk about a second European battlefield cannot but be greatly discounted. It is said that the overall situation in Europe will still have to be determined by the efforts of the East Asian nations. European philosophers have long spread the prophecy that "light comes from the East," and now, the time of realization is approaching! We Eastern nations should grasp the true content of the international situation and strengthen our efforts. The cooperation between China and Japan, the unity of the East Asian Axis, and the cooperation of one billion people in East Asia will be a symbol of victory in the world war!</p>

<p>Taiyuan, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, the Division Commander of the 8th Reserve Division of the 27th Army in Chongqing, has always been regarded as the right-hand man of the army commander, Hu Zongnan. During the Japanese army's summer campaign in the Taihang Mountains, he was forced by the Japanese army to push westward from the Taiyue area. At that time, he encountered approximately 2,000 men of the Communist Army's 772nd Regiment and the Taiyue Guerrilla Force and engaged in fierce battles. After a total of more than a thousand casualties on both sides, he finally broke through the resistance of the Communist army.

<p>Taiyuan, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain location on the front lines of Jin Province, Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, the Division Commander of the 8th Reserve Division of the 27th Army in Chongqing, has now decided to participate in the peace movement and strive to suppress the Communists and build the country. Lieutenant General Chen met with a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters here at 3:00 PM on the 1st and explained his determination to suppress the Communists and build the country. The main points of the Q&amp;A at the time are recorded as follows: (The reporter group asked: General Pang Bingxun has participated in the peace movement with a firm determination to suppress the Communists. I wonder what is Your Excellency's determination to suppress the Communists? (Lieutenant General Chen replied) The Communist Party must be thoroughly eliminated. However, political work is actually more important than military work. In the past eleven years alone, China has suffered from the scourge of the Communist Party. If it is left alone, there is only death. Therefore, surgery should be used to remove the germs. Therefore, if you truly want to save China, there is only suppressing and eliminating the bandits. (Asked) The National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War and the new policies towards China implemented by Japan, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, have you heard about them before when you were in the mountains, and what are your thoughts now that you have witnessed the reality? (Answered) I only learned about this after reading the newspapers since I came here. I heard nothing about it when I was in the mountains. When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, I thought that what Japan was doing was invading China. Only after I came here did I realize Japan's true intentions. East Asia should be East Asia for East Asians, not East Asia for the British and Americans. I am poorly educated, so my knowledge is limited. I will pay respects to Chairman Wang in the capital as soon as possible to seek guidance. After that, I am determined to sacrifice myself and serve the country to fulfill my military duties.</p>

<h3>Eight American Aircraft Forced to Land in Turkish Territory, Had Participated in Attacking Part of Romanian Protection Prior to This, Part of the Territory Issued Alerts</h3>
<p>Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Local officials announced yesterday that eight American bombers were forced to make an emergency landing in Turkey after participating in the attack on the oil fields of Romania on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ankara, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters: According to Turkish political figures, the eight damaged anti-Axis bombers landed in Turkey after the air raid on Ploesti, apparently violating Turkey's neutrality by British and American pilots. The average price here is: Not only did the anti-Axis bombers fly over Turkish territory on their way back, but they had also flown over Turkey when flying from Syria to Ploesti, which further increased the seriousness of the matter. Moreover, in order to take the shortest route to their destination, the anti-Axis air force repeatedly took the route through Switzerland, never respecting Switzerland's neutrality. The anti-Axis countries, regardless of the Swiss government's repeated protests, continue to violate Swiss sovereignty. The people of Turkey suspect that the British and Americans will take the same attitude towards Turkey.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency special correspondent Berner reports that the focus of the fighting on the Sicilian front remains in the central sector. German and Italian forces launched a fierce counterattack in the Cabisi area, finally filling in half of the gap that had been breached by enemy forces a few days ago. The German offensive completely surprised the enemy. German forces occupied a strategically important high ground and captured a large number of prisoners and spoils of war. In the Nicosia area, German defense forces, with the support of bombers, finally destroyed advancing enemy tanks and, using clever flanking tactics, cut off the retreat route of the American troops. In the fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy losses. After strong artillery preparation, American and Canadian forces launched an attack on the eastern and western sides of Regalbuto. Both offensives were launched from the south. The enemy forces attacking west of Regalbuto were repelled by a fierce German counterattack, suffering heavy casualties. At the same time, the Canadian forces attacking east of Regalbuto were bogged down in the mud in front of the German high ground positions and were hit by the destructive firepower of German heavy weapons. A portion of the Canadian forces managed to temporarily occupy some strongholds, but their communication with the rear was cut off. In the low-lying area of Catania, Canadian forces, on the left flank of the British Eighth Army, intensified their efforts to advance from the Simeto River valley towards the German mountain positions. The enemy attempted to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of the Simeto River, but this attempt completely collapsed under the defensive fire of the German artillery.</p>
<p>Zurich, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - In a surprise attack on Sunday, German forces occupied strategically important high ground in the Cabisi area of northern Sicily, thwarting the Allied attempt to advance on all fronts. General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa announced that the British Eighth Army, supported by air forces, had made progress yesterday in the main Axis positions south of Catania, but had been checked by a counterattack by German paratroopers and the Goering Division. Fierce fighting is still in progress. Reuters correspondent Brown, at the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters, reports that the fighting is gradually intensifying, and the attacking and defending forces have entered a stage of close combat. American forces are operating in the coastal area of northern Stefano. Canadian forces are attacking the central front. The enemy intends to advance through the German positions in Lealcatina to the main road connecting Enna and Catania. On the right flank south of this line, the Fifth North Camberian Division and the Fifty-first Highland Division, under the command of General Montgomery, are fiercely attacking the strongest Axis strongholds along the entire line. The war is advancing towards Catania and the foothills of Mount Etna. According to German news reports, the ground war has reached a tense stage.</p>
<h3>Great Results Achieved by Japanese Army in Taihang Mountains Operations This Summer: Chongqing's 27th Army Annihilated - Statement from Authorities of Japanese Army in North China</h3>
<p>Beiping, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Kato, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Army in North China, gave a statement at 3:00 PM on the 1st regarding the Japanese Army's summer operation in the Taihang Mountains. He stated that since July 10th, the Japanese Army has been conducting an annihilation campaign against the remnant Chongqing 27th Army in the southern Taihang Mountains, and has captured Chen Xiaogang, commander of the 8th Reserve Division, and many other officers, achieving great results. The mopping-up operation is still ongoing. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is the actions of the Chinese Communist Army, who took this operation as an opportunity to reap the benefits, ambushing and attacking the exhausted and fleeing remnants of the 27th Army in various places, inflicting a great blow on the Chongqing army. This fact has exposed the truth behind the Communist Party's slogans of "cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists" and "Chinese do not fight Chinese," further revealing that the Chinese Communist Party is not working to build China or revive the nation, but is only using the slogans of resistance against Japan and national war to communize East Asia and achieve its ambition of dominance. He earnestly hopes that enlightened people will awaken from the dream of resistance, understand the spirit of East Asian morality, and join them in the same direction, resolutely punishing the enemies who hinder the development of the new China.</p>
<p>Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from the Japanese Army front lines in Shanxi, the local Japanese Army authorities made the following statement on the 1st regarding the Japanese Army's current Taihang Mountains operation: Since July 10th, the Japanese Army in Shanxi, in cooperation with neighboring friendly forces, has attacked the Chongqing 27th Army (including the 8th Reserve Division, the 45th Division, and the 46th Division) in the area east and southeast of Lingchuan and Shengpei in southeastern Shanxi Province. The 27th Army suffered a considerable blow during the Taihang Mountains operation this spring, but fortunately escaped annihilation. Afterwards, it continued to lurk in the southern Taihang Mountains, attempting to rebuild its base. However, most of its officers and soldiers had lost their will to fight and realized the futility of resistance, and their desire to join the peace camp was growing. The Japanese Army had patiently waited for them to come over, but because Commander Liu Jin lacked decisiveness and remained stubbornly unrepentant, still hoping to maintain his empty reputation of resistance, the Japanese Army resolutely punished him by launching an attack. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese Army units, braving the sweltering heat and overcoming the difficulties of the mountainous terrain, have been pursuing, annihilating, and forcing surrenders everywhere, thoroughly eliminating the 27th Army and achieving the goal of the operation. During the operation, they also ambushed the main force of the 8th Reserve Division, which was trying to escape, causing it to collapse and capturing Lieutenant General Chen Xiaogang, the division commander, and Colonel Guo Peide, commander of the 136th Regiment of the 46th Division, achieving great results and boosting morale. The Japanese Army is still prepared to accept those who wish to participate in peace and ensure that they are all able to find their place. At the same time, they are determined to suppress those who remain unrepentant. It is said that this operation is called the "Eighteen Summer Operation."</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Discrimination Against the New Italian Government</h3>

On the night of the 27th, they inquired about the situation in Italy from the correspondent Mamoru Yamashita. Just as the Italian side announced to Germany the process of the Italian Premier's change, it was learned of the Italian internal trends and the reactions of various countries as follows:</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun: What is the reason for the change of the Italian Premier? Is there no information in Berlin?</p>
<p>Yamashita: On the 27th, the Italian authorities broadcasted the detailed process of Premier Mussolini's decision to retire. It is said that in the afternoon of the 24th, a general meeting of Fascist Party leaders was convened. Ciano, Grandi, De Bono, Lebegue, Scorzini, and other Fascist Party leaders attended. The meeting lasted for ten hours and only adjourned at 3:00 AM on the 25th. Grandi's proposal requested Mussolini to return the command of the three armies to King Emmanuel and to request the approval in accordance with the Constitution. The proposal passed by a majority of nineteen to seven, leading to Premier Mussolini's final decision to retire. It is noteworthy that former Foreign Minister Ciano also voted in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>Balkan Side</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun: This incident seems to have caused various reactions in various countries. What is the impact on the Balkans, which is close to Germany and has close relations with Italy?</p>
<p>Yamashita: From the reactions of the Balkans seen in the newspapers, the first is Hungary. On the 27th, newspapers praised Mussolini's achievements for Italy, thanking Mussolini for his friendly attitude of mutual approach. This is the view of the government's official newspaper, and it does not involve its own opinions. Romania, because it is close to the Eastern Front, has always been in step with Germany. No matter what happens in Italy, Romania's attitude will not change. The Eastern Front is regarded as the decisive factor in Romania, so it will faithfully abide by its alliance with Germany. As for Bulgaria, its attitude is very prudent, regarding the Italian coup as merely a domestic affair. It is too early to say how the situation will change in the future. Although the newspapers published photos of Mussolini, the Italian King, and the new Premier, they did not mention Bulgaria's position. Slovakia believes that after Italy is ruled by the King in the future, domestic unity will be further consolidated, so there will be no change in the diplomatic policy that is consistent with the Axis powers. Finally, regarding Turkey, its attitude is very cautious in order to avoid being included in the warring parties' campaigns. For example, the Turkish newspapers said that in the previous Great War, Italy was hit in Caporetto, and then made its last efforts to change the situation. The same situation is happening now in Italy, so the current Italian event is said to be to expand the capacity to resist by increasing the nation’s capacity to resist.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Side</p>
<p>Nichi Nichi Shimbun: The Anglo-American side will take this opportunity to publicize greatly!</p>
<p>Yamashita: First of all, I want to say that Churchill gave a speech on the Italian issue in the British Parliament today. This is quite an abrupt matter. The arguments of the British newspapers, such as the news carried in The Times today, are like this:</p>
<p>"The new Premier Badoglio is just a successor to Mussolini's policies, an old-fashioned soldier, and generally speaking, a general with no reputation at all."</p>
<p>The first sentence is to attack the person, and this must not be a word showing good feeling for the new Italian regime. The Times later said: "Is Italy not doing its best in this Italian coup? The Anglo-American side has repeatedly said that the Anglo-American side's attitude has stated, "But no matter what the attitude of Italy is, its fundamental policy remains unchanged." As for the United States, it is generally consistent with the United Kingdom and expresses opposition to the new Badoglio regime. The American newspapers stated that Badoglio, like Mussolini, is a follower of the same political philosophy. As a result, although Mussolini has disappeared, his shadow still appears frequently. Mussolini and Badoglio are both our enemies. (翔: Translated from the Western Tomorrow Newspaper on July 29)</p>

<h3>Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Expresses Gratitude to All Parties for Close Cooperation During His Tenure, Aiming to Benefit the Local Area</h3>
<p>Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is deeply grateful for the close cooperation extended by various sectors of society during his tenure. He has issued a written statement to express his sincere thanks. The original text of the statement is as follows:</p>
<p>"During my tenure as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I was deeply honored by the close cooperation extended by the entire society of Shanghai. I and my colleagues are extremely grateful. In the past, all citizens, in the spirit of friendship, assisted the Municipal Council in dealing with all issues related to the public interest. Regarding this, I always held it in my mind and was endlessly pleased. Recalling my tenure, I was always seeking to make all possible plans that would benefit the society. Although all facilities may not have been completely satisfactory, I am satisfied that the Municipal Council has made every effort to achieve this goal. The society has shown great understanding, suggestion and assistance to the Municipal Council, which is admirable.</p>
<p>The Baojia organization has assisted the police in maintaining public order and has made significant contributions. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>The general public has enthusiastically cooperated with the authorities in conducting civil defense training, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, my position as Chairman of the Municipal Council has always been a source of pleasure for me personally. I sincerely hope that the citizens will provide greater assistance and cooperation to the new administrative organs.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai press has been of great help in conveying various issues, becoming a necessary link between the Municipal Council and the citizens. Thank you all.</p>
<p>Finally, I and my colleagues would like to wish all the citizens the progress and prosperity of this great city."</p>
<h3>Baojia Youth Division Solicitation Committee to Raise Social Service Funds</h3>
<p>The Baojia Youth Division will hold a solicitation committee at 5:00 PM today at the International Hotel on the third floor to raise social service funds, discuss solicitation methods, and carry out related matters. The chairman of the solicitation committee is Mr. Yuan Ludeng, the vice-chairmen are Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Yu Hualong, the chairman of the supervisory committee is Mr. Wen Lanshi, the vice-chairmen are Mr. Zhang Yipeng and Mr. Wang Boyuan, and the secretary-general is Mr. Li Zulai.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Home for the Aged: An Eighty-One-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>"Grandma, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"Hehe, I'm young, I'm just a child, only eighty-one years old, haha!"</p>
<p>Silvery hair set off a ruddy face. How energetic and lively! The old woman who was adopted in the Home for the Aged happily replied to the reporter's questions about her feelings about living in the home. "There are also older sisters here. Some of them have been here for more than twenty years. You could talk about the stories of the home for days and still not finish! In short, one sentence: entering this door is a real blessing. I don't know what kind of cultivation I had in my previous life. Look, isn't everyone here strong and healthy? Even if some are sick, the nuns take such good care of them. Even if you had millions, your daughters-in-law wouldn't be so filial! Even if the Lord calls you back one day, you'll be happy. First, you have to thank God's grace. Second, you have to thank the Mother Superior for coming from abroad to support poor old people. Third, you have to thank the younger nuns..." She was so talkative. Almost every old person talked to the reporter heartily and happily.</p>
<p>Among the more than 350 old people from all over the country, there were more than 200 men and more than 150 women. There were more than 100 who were over 100 years old, and there were still many who were in their eighties and nineties. Most of them seemed to be very healthy. This is due to the perfect management of the Home for the Aged and the thoughtful service of the nuns. Daily life is orderly. In the morning, they take walks and play games. Before and after lunch, those who are particularly healthy help with laundry or cleaning houses, and growing vegetables. For the old women, there are also special old-fashioned spinning wheels, etc., to use this work to pass the time. There is also a seam room where they can repair their own clothes at will, but mainly to pass the time. They don't ask for any work results. Most of the old people are proud to help with work. Many are unhappy if they don't do it. After a thief broke into the home to steal something, one old woman volunteered to patrol all night. The robust posture of the old female guard gave people an unforgettable impression.</p>
<p>In addition to the rest rooms and recreation rooms, there are also bathrooms and other facilities in the home. Some of the weaker ones have to be helped into the bath by the nuns. For the needs of general patients, there is also a well-equipped sick room. The beds and bedding are all spotless. There are nuns on duty day and night. The old men and women here eat clean food, all assisted by the nuns. Among them, there was an old woman in her seventies or eighties who was sick. There was a young nun from St. Joseph's Girls' Middle School who had just been invited to the home carefully feeding her liquid food at her bedside. There were also nuns taking care of her and asking about her condition. It reminded people of the scene in the movie where the Empress Dowager was served a meal. It also made people feel a pang of conscience for their own neglect of their parents and the elderly in general.</p>
<p>There are many blind, lame, and disabled people in the Home for the Aged. The care of these old people requires greater patience. In addition to material satisfaction, it is also necessary to provide spiritual comfort. Every Sunday, they are sent to a special chapel by a sick car to hear the gospel. An old blind man who used to be in charge of the printing department at the American-Chinese Library told how he was lucky enough to enter the Home for the Aged, how he was baptized, and how optimistic he is today. He had regained the innocence of his childhood. He spoke so movingly. He was no longer blind. He saw the world so deeply.</p>
<h3>The Life and Sorrow of a Nun</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Home for the Aged, which people call heaven, is entirely run by Catholic nuns. The original Mother Superior, Sister Camille, was Belgian. Now, due to some reason, she cannot be in the home. Sister Rifenier, a typical French Catholic nun, is the acting Mother Superior. She has been serving in China for a long time. She told reporters that serving the lonely and helpless in China is the most blessed act. She feels very happy. There are thirty-two nuns. They have always vowed to be chaste, chant scriptures, and serve the elderly, and do not have contact with the outside world. In recent years, the source of foreign donations has been cut off, so they have to go out and solicit donations. In addition to the two who specialize in raising food, several nuns, including Tang De, Zhang Zhe, Selica, and Jiang, specialize in raising funds. Even in such hot weather, they have to run around the streets all day to solicit donations for the elderly from philanthropists. There are many Spanish, French, and other foreigners serving as nuns in the home. They are all willing to serve in China for a long time. There are more than 30 trainee nuns. All of their work is to serve the old men and women. Most of them are graduates of Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School. Some come from church girls' schools in other cities. Some are pampered daughters of wealthy families, and some are from ordinary families. They have all vowed to be chaste and dedicate themselves to serving the helpless elderly as a lifelong career. Perhaps because they are "filled with the Holy Spirit," the more they serve the poor old people who have nothing to do with them, the more pleasant they feel. Every one of them treats the old people with a smile, like they are their own loving parents. One of them said that after they entered the home, they could no longer live with their original families, because they had dedicated themselves to religious charity. But they can still receive relatives from their hometowns every month, indicating that they have not completely forgotten human feelings. In addition to their work, they also study at the "junior college" attached to the home to learn the skills of being a nun and serving the elderly.</p>
<p>The nuns are happy for the success of their career, but today they can no longer suppress the sorrow in their hearts. Because the funds in the home have been exhausted and the food supply is about to be cut off. This spring, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association and were dazzled by the "Association of Professions." From March, they subsidized 5,000 yuan per month for a total of three months. In June, they received another subsidy of 15,000 yuan, which relieved their worries slightly. As the food supply dwindles, their sorrow is deepening day by day. Sister Tang said that in addition to the home being built by the home itself, there is no fund for living people's food. On a monthly basis, at least 55 tons are needed. What can be obtained from the Grain Administration is only twelve bags. The remaining four-fifths need to be raised separately. In addition, about 10 tons of rice, 90 catties of oil, 250 catties of salt, 300 catties of beans, and 650 catties of salted fish are needed per month. 1,500 catties of vegetables, and soap, at least about 20 bolts of cloth, and other expenses, based on the July material cost, still need to pay 230 yuan for electricity, 250 yuan for tap water, and about 1,200 yuan for medicine. The bread eaten by more than thirty nuns costs about 3,000 yuan. The monthly expenditure is at least 20,000 yuan. However, they have been running around all day diligently collecting and collecting, and what they get is not even one-tenth of what they need. Thinking about the future, it is no wonder that the sincerely serving nuns are sinking into extreme sorrow. They said that they welcome large donations, but they also welcome small assistance. Whether it is cash, old clothes, rags, food, and daily necessities, they are all very much needed. In addition to the home at 39 Machine Factory Street, the social service columns of Shen Bao and Xinmin Evening News also collect donations for the home. "Respect the elderly of others as you would your own," is a virtue inherent in our country. May the major philanthropists of Shanghai fully promote this virtue and jointly maintain this paradise on earth, the Shanghai Home for the Aged. (End)</p>

<p>Whether there are cases of suspending business for more than one month for improper reasons.</p>

Each team consisted of five people, holding propaganda team flags and wearing armbands. The general public paid close attention to the propaganda and speeches given on various roads.</p>
<h3>Salt Affairs Bureau States No Fear of Salt Shortage</h3>
<p>There has been some panic regarding salt in this city recently. According to the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Bureau, the salt reserves in the city's warehouses are quite sufficient, and a large quantity of salt will continue to be transported to Shanghai in the coming days and the near future. There is absolutely no fear of shortage. The current panic is caused by being misled by rumors and spreading false information. Personnel have been dispatched to cooperate with the police to investigate and strictly crack down on such activity. At the same time, the Yuhua Company has been ordered to distribute salt to various salt shops and sauce shops in the city within a few days, selling at the prescribed prices. The situation of panic will naturally disappear. It is hoped that the people of this city will wait calmly and not be misled by rumors.</p>
<h3>43rd Period Household Rice Rationing Available Soon, 200,000 Bags Arriving in Shanghai, Milling to be Completed</h3>

<p>However, for the 43rd period of household rice, the rice and grain joint operating company has not yet allocated it to the rice flour distribution office of the materials control department of the First District Public Office, so the office has not yet been able to issue vouchers to rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts for widespread sale. However, according to news from the rice and grain joint operating company, 200,000 bags of rice have been transported to Shanghai, and milling will be completed soon, and it should be available for distribution and sale within a few days.</p>

<h3>Various Circles Offer Condolences to Two Self-Defense Policemen Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>The China Pharmaceutical Bank received a total of 54,216.6 yuan in condolence payments on July 26th on behalf of the families of Shen and Jiang, bringing the total to 129,898.1 yuan. Also, this newspaper published on the 28th of last month that it collected 500 yuan donated by Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Company as a condolence payment to the two self-defense policemen who died in the line of duty. It was mistakenly published as Dafeng Construction Company, hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Continued Collection of Condolence Payments</p>
<p>Here is a list of the titles of those from all walks of life who have continued to send condolences to the self-defense policemen who died in the line of duty, as collected by this newspaper: All members of the Second Joint Security of the Old Zha District, 15,412 yuan (delivered by Joint Security Chief Zhang Songtao), Xu Yixin, 100 yuan, totaling 15,512 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 12,392 yuan.</p>
<h3>Simple Insurance Bureau Recruiting Salesmen</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Social Simple Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare, it has been handling compulsory labor insurance. Many industrial and commercial factories and businesses in various districts of this city have enthusiastically applied for registration. It is learned that the bureau is recruiting 30 salesmen to take care of its busy workload and train talent. Applicants must be high school commercial graduates, healthy, with no bad habits, and between 18 and 25 years old (limited to males). During the probation period, the salary is 200 yuan, and lunch is provided. Applicants can submit their resume and supporting documents to the bureau at 527 Bazilu on the 6th and 7th of this month for registration and oral examination.</p>
<p>Economic Circles</p>
<h3>Commentary: Defending Against Ideological Toxins</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang, in a conversation with news reporters in this city the day before yesterday, advocated clarifying different viewpoints and defending against ideological toxins. The chairman said, "Shanghai has five million people with extremely complex economic, cultural, educational, and ideological backgrounds... If we only use suppressive methods to prohibit them, making them invisible in writing, it will be ineffective." These words are truly worthy of being described as illuminating everything! To give an example, since newspapers and magazines in Shanghai have been prohibited from disclosing financial and commercial market conditions, the soaring daily commodity prices remain the same, the surging commercial market prices remain the same, and the rampant black market prices remain the same.</p>
<p>The chairman mentioned defending against ideological toxins and placed economic ideology first, precisely because the suffering of the people of Shanghai's economic life is caused by economic ideological toxins. What are economic ideological toxins? The most common is the psychology of valuing goods high and devaluing currency, followed by the psychology of only wanting personal wealth and disregarding national interests. These ideological toxins cannot be eliminated, but how can the methods and steps for their elimination be reasonable and effective?</p>
<p>Assuming that the people of Shanghai's economic ideology are not yet deeply poisoned, disinfection must be carried out quickly, because prevention seems to be somewhat too late.</p>
<h3>Chang Bureau Determined to Rectify Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors in the District, Completely Eradicating Hoarding and Speculation in a Short Period</h3>
<p>After the two concessions in this city were courageously recovered by our country's Chang Bureau, the First and Eighth District Public Offices have also been established. They are currently actively establishing internal organizations and gradually reforming the administrative malpractices of the past concessions. In about three to several months, the appearance of the old concessions will surely be completely eliminated. As for the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors within the First and Eighth Districts, the relevant authorities, in view of the difficulties in management and the many malpractices in the past due to the obstruction of the concessions, which led to speculation and hoarding by financial institutions, and manipulation and price increases by industrial and commercial sectors, as well as black market operations, poisoning the people's livelihood, are no trivial matter. Now that the concessions have been recovered and administration has been unified, the relevant authorities will thoroughly rectify the past malpractices. Regarding the monetary aspect, the Ministry of Finance and the relevant agencies in this city will work closely together to gradually tighten supervision. The first step for industrial and commercial sectors is to carry out a comprehensive investigation to ensure that no one hoards materials or raises prices privately. The first step is to universally promote a rationing system for production and consumption so that the industrial and commercial sectors cannot seize illegal profits. It is learned that the highest Chang Bureau of the government is extremely concerned about the above and will take strict measures to suppress prices in the short term. Fortunately, the industrial and commercial sectors in this city will quickly conduct self-examination and no longer engage in illegal activities of speculation and hoarding to avoid regretting it later.</p>
<h3>Timber Control Association Formally Established</h3>

Other necessary matters related to achieving the association's goals.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally fell. The main reasons were: 1. Tight monetary policy, both overt and covert. 2. New stocks are constantly appearing, dispersing investment power. 3. Rumors that the assets of various companies and factories will be investigated and assessed. 4. Sharp fall in gold and commodity prices. Since the upward trend started on July 8, it has risen too much in the past month, and those with profits are seeking to sell and realize their gains, so sentiment has softened. However, with the struggle of old investors and the continuous joining of new participants, and the stimulation of capital increases and stock bonuses for several stocks, although each stock has fallen slightly, the overall trend is still sideways. Trading was brisk. Yong'an Textile in the textile industry had the largest decline, even breaking through two levels. Dasheng No. 2 and No. 2 factories also saw declines. Rongfeng also fell sharply. Small-face-value stocks were held up by small investors, although still slightly weak. Xinhua, Xinzhong, Dachina Weaving, Guoxin, and Baofeng were all flat and tired. Hongsheng Weaving and Dyeing, Gonghe, and Guoguang were all firm. In the department store industry, Yong'an, Xinxin, and Wing On, the three companies, fell by nearly half a hundred. The latter two retreated to around four levels. Innerwear sharply retreated by more than ten. Jingfu Hosiery fell by several yuan. Lunlun entered within two levels and was relatively strong. In the cultural industry, the asking price for Commerce and Trade was higher than the previous day, but there were no transactions. Both it and China Bookstore were flat. The world saw small transactions. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electricity both retreated. The asking prices for Xinya and Xinyi in the new pharmaceutical industry also returned slightly. Wuzhou and Zhongxi were flat. Jiuan Industrial Stock fell nearly ten points. Xinya Construction retreated. China and Guohua Investment both saw small declines. Xinghua and Dachina Industrial were both tired. Lianhua and Xinyi Real Estate also retreated. Nanyang Tobacco Company remained at the previous price. Dachina Match suddenly dropped by half a hundred. The asking prices for Standard Gourmet Powder, Jimei Food, China Clock Factory, Sanlun Passenger Cars, Pufeng Paper, and Zhongxing Timber fluctuated and trended flat. With the appearance of new stocks, Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving was about four times higher than the face value, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical was about two times higher.</p>

<h3>Baoquan Cup Round Gateball Charity Match, Red Team Wins Big Over West Allied Team 6 to 4, Master of Ku Zhai Purchases Charity Ball for 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to raise funds for the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund and the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, Baoquan Craft Factory initiated and held the Baoquan Cup round gateball charity match. It was grandly opened at the Guangxia Middle School stadium at 5 pm yesterday. Zhou Bangjun and Wang Dequan personally attended to deliver the opening speech and preside over the opening ceremony. Halfway through the game, the match ball was auctioned, and the great philanthropist Master Ku Zhai won the bid for 30,000 yuan, which is commendable. The women were the first to take the stage. The West Allied team got the ball and attacked. Boerroki rushed straight up and threw the ball hard. The central guard Shi Ruijuan commanded a powerful save, turning danger into safety. Before long, the Central Allied team suddenly launched a counterattack, and Wang Fuzhi shot through with a hundred steps, returning with merit. Although the West Allied heroes tried to struggle, they were unable to do so, and in the first half, the Central Allied team took the lead with 1 to 0. Changing sides to fight again, the West women attacked, and Simaki took advantage of the situation to intrude, but Shi Ruijuan of the Central Allied team was careless for a moment, and the ball went into the net, creating a tie. In less than seven minutes, Huang Mingyuan of the Central Allied team fired a powerful round ball, scoring a goal and setting the winning goal at 2 to 1. The afternoon game began, with Zhang Jufei as the referee. Bao Songyuan of the Red Team went deep alone, but unfortunately stepped on the white line and was ruled invalid, to no avail. After three minutes, Kiejiel Milov of the West Allied Team scored with a high throw, and He Xiaoguang of the Red Team entered the penalty area by mistake, resulting in a six-yard penalty kick. Kiejiel Milov took the penalty, and the West Allied Team took the lead 1 to 0. At twelve minutes, Fan Qingcheng intercepted the ball and scored, making it 1 to 1. The game gradually became tense. Li Yao of the team broke through and scored, and Yu Fusing quickly retaliated. Later, Li Yao scored another goal. The West Team was unwilling to lag behind for long, and Sasikin shot a cold arrow, making it 3 to 3, ending the first half. After switching to another side, Li Yao of the Red Team was indeed extraordinary, scoring two more goals. The West Allied Team had exhausted its strength after a long battle and was unable to support itself. Bao Songyuan added the finishing touch, giving the Red Team an absolute advantage of 6 to 3. Two minutes before the end of the game, Sasikin scored a goal, and the Red Team won a big victory over the West Allied Team by a score of 6 to 4.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Political Problems After Taking Over the Concessions</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yichong</p>
<p>Using political power to rectify prices. The price of goods in extraordinary times is naturally due to the imbalance of supply and demand, the lack of resources, or inflation. However, we must recognize that the rise and fall of prices are not entirely based on the above reasons, but rather on the control, manipulation, speculation, and hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. The psychology of speculation and hoarding can also be said to be driven by the psychology of the German Mark, thinking that China's current currency is no different from the Mark. It should be known that after the First European War in Germany, the expansion of the Mark was initially natural, and later it was the result of national policy, which was to eliminate the large capitalists who became rich due to the war, and to use a short-term elimination policy to correct the people. From this point of view, the pity of these unscrupulous merchants who have no national concept is even more apparent. Therefore, the government should use the underlying political power to enlighten these culprits of society.</p>
<p>The government should also have the determination to thoroughly investigate hoarding and suppress prices, and cannot relax. It is also an urgent and serious problem to be solved, and it can also be said that the organization of modern political economy is incomplete and cannot meet the current trend.</p>
<p>Using political power to eradicate opium and gambling. After the Opium War, the British imported a large amount of drugs into China in order to make profits. Because of the corruption of the Qing government at the time, humiliating national conditions were created. The humiliation of a hundred years can be said to be washed away today. However, the poison of opium still remains among the people, and opium dens are everywhere. After decades of efforts to ban drugs, there is still no way to do it, which is really heartbreaking. Since opium cannot be eradicated, the Shanghai gambling dens that follow closely still exist, and it has been five or six years since then. In these five or six years, the promotion of social evils is truly unspeakable. If the authorities have no determination, special forces will grow day by day, creating the deeply rooted situation today.</p>
<p>It should be known that the expectations of the general public for the recovery of the concessions are as enthusiastic as the expectations for the eradication of opium and gambling. It is hoped that the government will use strong political power to eliminate "opium" and "gambling" in Shanghai's governance plan, and complete true sovereign independence and enlightened politics.</p>
<h3>Understanding and Cooperation of the Lower Classes</h3>
<p>— Fei Nianren</p>
<p>It has been three or four years since the National Government returned to the capital. Politically, militarily, and economically, it has gained much understanding and assistance from Japan. However, this is only understanding between governments, or it can be said that it is understanding between the upper classes.</p>
<p>The so-called "government" is an organ that truly implements the opinions of the people. Therefore, to make the government strong, it is necessary for the people to unanimously support it: to promote politics, it is also necessary for the people to assist it. But does today's government represent and truly implement the opinions of all the people? And are the people now sincerely supporting and enthusiastically assisting?</p>
<p>The difficulty in promoting the National Government's fundamental policies can be said to be due to the inability of the lower classes of the people of China and Japan to understand each other. On the one hand, it is of course that the Chinese people still have traditional misunderstandings about Japan. On the other hand, the behavior of the Japanese people also conflicts with the traditional habits of the Chinese people. These, when viewed from the overall perspective of politics, are small. However, they are the personal pain of the people, and therefore, the psychological impact on the people is also very significant. Therefore, it is hoped that the goodwill between China and Japan will be expanded from the upper classes to the lower classes in the future.</p>

<h3>Mr. Du</h3>
<p>— Yu Ruowen</p>
<p>Civil servant Mr. Du suddenly perceived that a vengeful ghost with a green face and fangs was chasing him from behind, holding a long and large awl, aiming directly at the back of his head. He, as if his soul had left his body, only knew to escape desperately, escape, but only felt a wave of weakness in his legs, and suddenly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>His heart, filled with extreme fear, slowly opened its eyes, only to realize that he had fallen in the warm quilt. Just now, it was just a nightmare. However, his heart was still extremely uneasy, as if struggling to jump out of his chest again. He stretched out his left hand and gently pressed his chest. The dim light outside the quilt took the opportunity to sneak into the quilt, reflecting in his eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Du was washing her face in a corner. Seeing the quilt on the bed move, she knew that her husband had woken up. She slightly frowned, seemingly regretting that the sound of wringing her towel was too loud, thus waking her husband. Indeed, at this time, besides the faint sound of rain outside, the sound of washing her face was the loudest in the room.</p>
<p>"Qingyun, it's still early. You can sleep a little longer. I'll call you when I've made breakfast!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Du said softly to Mr. Du, and then took the washbasin downstairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Du glanced at Mrs. Du's back and sighed softly. He propped himself up on the bed with both hands and sat up. Listening to Mrs. Du's heavy footsteps on the stairs, he sighed again and muttered to himself, "Alas, Huibo is working too hard. I'm really sorry for her!"</p>
<p>Mr. Du's words came from the bottom of his heart. Fifteen years ago, when he was studying at school, he met Liu Huibo—his current wife—at that time, she was a progressive female student, passionate, hardworking, and healthy. Mr. Du was also a handsome young man at the time. They loved each other like a pair of kittens, never willing to let her worry or work hard. Later, they had the fruits of their love—a maid, a nanny, and a wet nurse—so she didn't need to work hard. Although Mr. Du didn't have much family property, he entered the post office as a civil servant a year after graduating from school. At that time, his salary was enough to support their small family. They planned for the future and felt it was bright and happy! Mr. Du was also quite frugal. Over the past ten years, he had saved about twenty to thirty thousand dollars. He estimated that in another ten years, the interest alone would be enough to cover their expenses. At that time, he planned to travel all over the world with his wife—this was what Mr. Du thought at the time.</p>
<p>But alas, the war shattered their plans and extinguished their ideals. The cost of living soared, and the savings of the past ten years had completely vanished in "supplementing the family expenses." The servants had long been dismissed, and the clothing and food of the four children were taken care of by the wife herself. They had to give up the rented building and move into this small pavilion room.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mr. Du couldn't help but look at this pigeon-cage-like room and suddenly noticed that a five-candlepower light bulb was still on. "Ah!" Mr. Du exclaimed anxiously, "I forgot to turn off the light. If the landlord sees it, turning on the light so early in the morning will cause trouble again!" He hurriedly reached out to turn off the light, but perhaps he was too flustered, and the youngest child sleeping at his end of the bed was jostled awake. As usual, the baby first called out "Papa, Mama" randomly, then started clamoring "I want this, I want that," waking up the twelve-year-old younger brother and nine-year-old younger sister sleeping at the foot of the bed. Seeing that he couldn't stay in bed any longer, Mr. Du got out of bed, picked up the baby, and dressed him. The child had lost a lot of weight recently. "Alas, malnutrition, malnutrition!" Mr. Du sighed in pain. At this moment, he suddenly thought of his eldest son, Mingsheng. Mingsheng had been living in his parents' home in the countryside for two years to recuperate from tuberculosis. According to the latest letter, Mingsheng's tuberculosis was getting worse. Mr. Du's heart trembled: "If Mingsheng has any misfortune, how can I face him, face Huibo? It's all caused by malnutrition!"</p>
<p>By the time the three children were dressed, washed, and the room was tidied up, Mrs. Du had also prepared breakfast. She brought up a bowl of yellow bean sprouts, a plate of pickled cucumbers, and two loaves of cornbread, then served the children porridge one bowl at a time.</p>
<p>The youngest child first climbed onto the stool and, seeing these old dishes, shouted, "Papa, I don't want to eat these dishes. I want to eat meat buns, meat buns!"</p>
<p>"Be good, eating meat buns will give you a stomachache. Let's eat hot porridge. Tomorrow, Dad will take you to the Great World to eat wonton noodles and watch the monkeys perform!"</p>
<p>The little one sat down silently after being coaxed.</p>
<p>"Dad, the teacher at school said that this semester's tuition must be paid no matter what. If it's not paid, the teacher said that my sister and I won't be able to go to school anymore."</p>
<p>The twelve-year-old younger brother had just taken a sip of porridge when he suddenly remembered this and said to his father.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Mr. Du remained impassive, only humming in his throat. But just as Mr. Du was planning how to get money to pay for tuition, pay rent, and buy some vitamin-rich food for the baby, a hurried report came from downstairs:</p>
<p>"Express mail! Mr. Du has express mail! The postman needs a stamp at the door!"</p>
<p>Mr. Du put down his bowl and rushed downstairs. In less than two minutes, Mr. Du was already upstairs, his face ashen, holding the opened letter. He threw the letter to his wife and said in a trembling voice, "Huibo, look, it's an express letter from the countryside. It says that Mingsheng is almost gone…"</p>
<p>"What?" Mrs. Du's eyes immediately filled with tears.</p>
<p>"I have to go, go to the countryside!" Mr. Du put on his clothes and walked quickly.</p>
<p>"But… you haven't asked for leave… you have to go to the bureau to work, you have official business…" Mrs. Du chased to the door, saying in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"I can't worry about 'official business'!"</p>
<p>In the drizzling rain, this was Mr. Du's reply.</p>
<h3>Son of a Teacher</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zuxie</p>
<p>Long'er is eleven years old this year—the right age to be in school; but Long'er has never gone to school!</p>
<p>Long'er went to school for a year, when he was seven years old. His family had just moved to Shanghai from their hometown. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, Long'er was dazzled by the wide roads, the speeding cars, trams, and rickshaws, the coolies, the tall buildings, the Sikh policemen, and the flashing neon lights. However, in Long'er's eyes, these things were just novel and fun; he never felt envious. He envied the children who were about the same age as him. He watched them go to school early in the morning with their schoolbags on their backs, jumping and skipping, humming songs, accompanied by their parents. As soon as they arrived at school, they immediately put down their schoolbags and jumped onto the playground. They gathered a few classmates and bounced the ball around. It was really fun!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bell rang. Then he watched them hurriedly put down the ball and run into the classroom in single file, sitting on low stools, listening to the smiling teacher tell a strange story; then the teacher knocked on the long box "dong dong ding", and the children followed, opening their mouths and singing "bao ya de" at the top of their lungs; after singing, they opened their books and read "Big sheep run, little sheep jump…" This…this is really fun!</p>
<p>Long'er had secretly watched them three or four times; his ardent envy grew to a boiling point with each peek. Finally, one afternoon, Long'er couldn't help himself. He made a request when his mother was happy. "Mom! I want to go to school!…All the other children go to school!" Long'er pouted, a little bit coquettish.</p>
<p>"Okay! I'll talk to Dad in a while!" Mom stroked Long'er's hair, saying affectionately.</p>
<p>That night, Long'er was lying in bed, listening to Mom say to Dad: "Long'er is not young anymore, let him go to school too!"</p>
<p>Dad sighed "ai". Long'er's heart skipped a beat. Then he shrank his body into the corner and listened intently to Dad's "verdict." He should have been sent to school long ago; but where would the tuition come from?…I am a primary school teacher, my income is meager, and it's already difficult to make ends meet, let alone add this burden!…Fortunately, he has just started to learn. It's okay to teach him myself at home!"</p>
<p>Long'er almost cried. But as soon as he heard Mom speaking again, "Long'er told me himself that he wants to study. It's always good for children to like studying. Just let him go!…Tomorrow, go talk to the principal to see if he can reduce the fees…You are a teacher, teaching children all day long, wouldn't it be a shame if your own child is deprived of education?"</p>
<p>Dad thought it was a good point: "Okay! I'll talk to the principal tomorrow!"</p>
<p>After discussing it, Long'er's wish came true. Early in the morning, he carried his schoolbag and was led by Dad, jumping and skipping to school!</p>
<p>But after only a year—a short year—Long'er still dropped out of school!</p>
<p>With the rising cost of living, Dad really couldn't afford the tuition—even though it was only half price! Long'er was clever, a teachable talent; but seeing that he had ranked first twice in a year, one would know. But now, because he couldn't pay the tuition, he had to stay at home!</p>
<p>Long'er cried for this. But what was the use of crying? Not being able to pay the tuition was like a sweet memory!</p>
<p>However, Long'er sometimes thought about it for Dad, and he really couldn't go to school anymore. Just looking at how the family's meals had changed from two meals of rice and one of porridge to three meals of porridge, then to two meals of porridge, and how the porridge had gone from thick to thin, and from thin to like boiling water, he understood.</p>
<p>Long'er wanted to ask Dad to teach him at home; but Dad always came home with a large stack of papers, and after grading them, the night was already late. He should let Dad sleep and get up early the next day! Dad couldn't get a moment's rest. Life was whipping him to work all day long, so that he was thin and out of shape. In this way, even if there was a little free time, Long'er couldn't bear to take advantage of this only opportunity—to ask Dad to teach him!</p>
<p>Long'er's schoolbag is now used to hold rice. What Long'er is busy with all day is helping Mom with chores! Long'er had asked Mom a few times: "Mom! When will I be able to go back to school?"</p>
<p>"Maybe next year!" Mom said. But when next year came, Long'er was still doing chores! He asked Mom again. Mom's answer was still next year!</p>
<h3>The Helmsman's Song</h3>
<p>— Bai Bi</p>
<p>In the clear morning, raise the white sail, advance with the wind, and sail into the sea of life. The small waves surge, as if whispering to you. The gentle breeze slowly comes, as if caressing your scattered hair. The small islands on the left and right beckon you, enticing you to come and play. Attention! Helmsman! Don't be distracted by momentary pleasure. Change your rudder and go off course. You must know that around those beautiful little birds, there are many hidden reefs. Move forward! Don't hesitate! Follow your established course straight to your goal!</p>
<p>The setting sun is about to set, dark clouds rise in the east, the wind becomes violent! The waves roar! As if unachieved vengeance, they want to swallow you down. The gale seems to want to tear your sail. The huge waves seem to want to break your boat. Helmsman! Helmsman!</p>
<p>Persevere, stay calm, be bravely determined.</p>
<p>Grip your rudder. Don't be afraid of any hardships or obstacles. Move forward! Don't hesitate! Follow your established course straight to your goal! Darkness passes, light returns, all sounds are silent.</p>
<p>Seagulls are busy looking for breakfast again.</p>
<p>The goal can already be seen in the distance. The wind is caressing your scattered hair again.</p>
<p>The waves are giving you sweet smiles again. Helmsman! Helmsman! Based on your past spirit, persevere through the last few minutes. Move forward! Remember: As long as you work hard, you will succeed. As long as you struggle, you will eventually triumph!</p>
<p>(Proceeds from this are to help students.)</p>
