<h3 id="c1">節約電流 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近華中上海兩電力公司，因煤斤來源困難，幷實踐戰時生活起見，規定限制用電辦法。我們主張除去生產事業以及社會服務事業，必須維持其最低需要電以外，期待限制辦法澈底實行。</p>
<p>昨天本市市府並訂定節約電流辦法四項，自明年一月一日實行。我們觀察市府訂定四項辦法，在原則上絕對護切實執行。希望關係商店及娛樂塲所，不待明年一月一日從即日起先自實行，不待强迫限制，先自遵從節約。同時，我們希望市府不但訂為節約辦法，進而規定限制法令，違者處罰。不僅用勸吿節約的方式，進而必須强制執行。</p>
<p>共次，市府訂辦法中，對於息燈時間，我們認為再可提早，尤其如樂塲所，戲院，舞廳，茶室等，在戰時縱不根本廢止，也應盡量縮短時間。凡是白天忙於工作者，晚間必須充分休息，雖云娛樂可以減少與恢復疲勞，但過於迷戀，終必勞神耗財，浪費時間。因此，限制如樂塲所營業時間，不僅可以節約電流，並可節約衆人的精神與金錢，在此戰時，其意義尤為重大。</p>
<h3 id="c2">耶誕與冬賑 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>一年一度的耶穌聖誕節，快又蒞臨了，依照慣例習俗，一般信徒固然為慶祝而送禮點綴，即非信徒而好時髦的也要乘機尋樂，狂樂終宵，而一般商店以及娛樂塲所，更別出心裁，招徠顧客。</p>
<p>可是，今年的情形不同了。我們知道大東亞戰爭巳經進入第三年，中國參戰快近一年，愈益接近決戰階段，在這緊張的時代裏，我們必須以非常的情緒與動作，迎接此非常的時代，一切奢糜習俗慣例，決不能沿用了。今年耶穌聖誕節，希望敎徒與非敎徒大家廢除習俗，不送禮，不狂歡，商店與如樂塲所也應廢除，減少消耗享樂的招徠營業方法，以實踐戰時的非常生活。</p>
<p>我們尊重信敎自由，同時，反對在非常時期，利用節目，作狂歡　費之舉。</p>
<p>全年的耶穌聖誕節，我們願意提倡兩事，希望耶敎信徒實行，同時，非倣徒也可實行，藉以共伸紀念：</p>
<p>第一，以厲行節約廢除習俗，將準備餽贈與娛樂費用，悉數節約，並以之捐助冬賑。</p>
<p>第二，以同情精神紀念耶誕，當此嚴冬，苦難同胞，待賑迫切，踴躍輸將，捐助冬賑，卽可解除苦難同胞倒懸之危，這才是紀念耶穌聖誕最好的表示。</p>

<p>中央社訉　昨日午後一時許，本市第八區大上海路，共舞台前，發生軍警衝突，致釀成流血慘劇，泰山路分局警察，死傷十人，警防股主任基景陽，亦因公殉職，中央稅警總團士兵十餘人亦受傷，茲將各情分誌於後：</p>
<p>肇事主因係屬尋釁</p>
<p>肇事主因，緣駐紮於南市區之中央稅警總團一部份士兵，於前日（十八日）至第八區共舞台觀劇，因購票發生爭執，幾至釀成重大事態，該管泰山路分局得悉後，立即派遣大隊警員，到塲彈壓，並將肇事軍士，帶入該局，旋經開釋，事後稅警總團長羅君强，及副團長熊劍東等，得悉後正在澈查中，不意少數軍士，以被拘入局，心殊不甘，乃於昨日下午一時許，馳至共舞台前尋釁，遂至釀成開鎖流血慘劇。</p>
<p>企圖彈壓釀成流血</p>
<p>尋釁士兵，係稅醫總團軍士第二大隊一部份士兵，於昨日午後一時許，由南市出發，分由各鐵門駛入第八區，在大上海路共舞臺前集中全副武裝，首先將共舞臺實施包圍，一面驅散行人。時泰山路分局，亦巳得報，恐　事態，遂由警防股主任基景陽率同預備班警士馳赴該處企圖彈壓，孰意警士甫行開抵該處，而衝突　起，一剎那間，槍聲陡起，四週秩序大亂，行人各自趨避，轉瞬間，共舞臺前已有多人倒臥於血泊中。當慘案未發生前，二十分鐘時，共舞臺主持人張善琨，目覩門次軍士徘徊，心知有異，當即致電該副總團長熊劍東，熊氏得悉後，即行率同衛隊五人，由寓駛至共舞臺，企圖阻止，不意熊氏車輛甫行抵達，而槍聲巳起，遂不及阻止。</p>
<p>軍警雙方各有死傷</p>
<p>事後共舞台附近商店，以不明眞相，各自閉門，停止營業，而泰山路分局，立即派出救護車，將臥倒於血泊中者，舁至廣慈醫院救治，計當塲警士先後被擊斃者，共五人，俄捕二人，傷數人，流彈擊傷路人二人。泰山分局警防股主任基景陽，年約卅餘歲，不幸亦因公殉職，查基氏結婚未久，家有老母弱妻，遭此變故，厥狀殊慘，而稅警團方面，亦有軍士十人受傷，當場由稅警團送至中警醫院診治。中央社記者昨向泰山路分局探悉，被擊斃之警士：　一二五號，　五六號，　八三三號，　二二〇號，　一二一號，俄捕二人：　五二號，　十五號，其餘受傷警士，雖在救治，但半數均傷勢甚重。</p>
<p>市政當局發表談話</p>
<p>市政當局為昨日軍警在第八區衝突事發表談話云：『前晚因稅警　有兵士往共舞台觀劇，為購票入座事，小有爭執，旋往警局排解未遂，帶入警局、逐至少數不良份子，挾　肇事，乘昨日星期例假，邀集同班，利用出操時，携有軍械之便，前往尋釁。其時立由共舞台經理張善琨，邀同稅警團副總團長熊劍東，親往彈壓，但禍端巳　，至長　士兵，死傷業巳查明者，各約十名，路人受傷者二人，殊屬不幸之至。惟此　原於尋釁而起，絕無其他關係，後即由警察前往遮斷交通，加以制止，一小時後即行恢復，至肇事士兵，自當依法懲處。</p>
<p>稅警當局發表談話</p>
<p>稅警總　當局為昨日軍警在第八區衝突事，發表談話云：「關於本總團所屬軍士隊士兵，因觀劇購票之故，引起重大誤會，致生軍警働突事件，其大體經過，如市政當局所發表者。此種不幸事件，誠　遺　之至，當時使市民受驚，尤感不安，本總團負責當局、已電主管機關自請處分，對於肇事士兵，必須查明，依法懲處，至所屬駐滬部隊，已嚴令主管官長，嚴加約束，毋使滋事。」</p>

<h3 id="c46">未來的太平洋戰略 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>紐約泰晤士報的軍事記者漢遜，飽爾溫最近視察太平洋及亞洲戰綫，囘到美國，寫作關於太平洋戰略的論文，獲得表立齊新聞　，該論文不如美海軍長官諾克斯等徒然　稱美國所發動的大攻勢，很愼重地檢討關於對日戰的將來美國所應採的方針，暗示美國今後對日戰略的方向何在，頗堪注目。新的戰略論</p>
<p>新的戰略論</p>
<p>鮑爾溫先尖刻地說：　　國公然聲稱相信重慶政　正在逐漸博得勝利，這是　語。」繼又檢討從大陸方面的對日攻勞，其論調如左：</p>
<p>「一般美國人以為渝軍的風氣良好者，完全因為一般美國人被滞留於重度地區齣宣教師報告，重慶救濟資金運動，和宣傳電影等給與了完全虛偽的印象所致。我們不能看滿重慶政權的弱點。大槪中國者，並不如我們普通所想像一樣的中國，那不過單是地理學的觀念而已，重慶政權並不能對日本博得勝利，又將來在對日戰上亦不會獲勝。淪軍在戰鬥中未會獲勝而是失敗，日本在中國並未戰敗，日本在戰爭中不僅勝利，日由此獲得對英美戰的貴重經騐。重慶政權所發表的戰况公報，殆無何等價値，如其日本軍眞正喪失了重慶方面所說的日軍損害數之半，則日本現在不能不感到兵力的不足。</p>
<p>重慶的孤立</p>
<p>當然，把武器供給重慶政相是必要的，但在重慶政權之下，沒有眞正可稱為軍隊的軍隊。大部份的軍隊，訓練旣低劣，亦無使用近代兵器的能力。他們必須長期的訓練和勇猛的指揮官。反過來看日本方面，日木控制了中國一切的　灣和交通要道把華北最重要的鑛物資源收入掌中，所以日本經濟的地位也巳經强化了。總而言之，今日的渝軍，雖在將來，欲把日本軍從中國方面驅逐出去是不可能的。英美要在中國大陸上向日本軍決戰，必須對中國供給很多的武器，其他軍需品及軍隊。欲在中國大陸上對日本軍獲得勝利，我們不能不使大軍駐屯於中國，不能不建築很多的大飛機塲以轟炸日本本土。不僅須大量訓練眞正像軍隊的渝軍，英美軍水身也不能不遣送大部隊。然這裏成為問題者是補充，這又可視為難於解決的問題。現在屬於重慶政權下的地域，完全從世界孤立·那裏除了從印度空路越過喜瑪拉雅山以外，別無他道，其困難可想而知。飛機不能不戰足回程用的汽油。那裏飛機塲為數極少·又時被季節風所困。美國空輸司令部及中國航空公司雖運營到重慶方面的航空路，但和以前的漢緬綫比較起來，其運輸力減低三分之一，每日平均不能運輸二百噸。且運輸雖在逐漸增加中，假定能達到滇緬綫當時的量之三倍，還不足補充在中國大陸上英美所預期中的大軍。每師　在戰門上所需要的軍需品之量，每日為一千噸。要使日本從大陸孤立，須奪囘中國的全部港潛，要空襲日本本土，並從中國驅逐日本軍，反軸心軍不能不在中國大陸備有大最的陸軍和大規模的空軍，於此，奪囘緬旬乃有着重要的意義。」</p>
<p>對華補充問題</p>
<p>且關於對華補充問題上，飽爾溫是悲　的，據他的見解，「滇緬路的再開為大問題。」那就是說，滇緬路的再開，不能解決對重慶補充問題。滇緬綫的運輸量，無論怎樣般法，最多增加二倍至三倍，這不足以補充帶有前述任務的遠征軍。加以每日能裝卸一千至二千噸的港口，全部在日本軍手中，所以鮑爾滬說：『如其不同時實施大規模的水陸用路作載，奪囘這些港口是不可能的。」結論說。：</p>
<p>「要打倒日本，不能不海陸同時打破。日本要塞不能不從澳洲，所羅門羣鳥，從阿留申列島，從印度及重慶，多方面同時進攻。但主要攻勢路綫當為以夏威夷，中途島為基點的西進作戰路綫，首先直衝日本的心臟部，淪軍沒有演出決定的任務之必要。在太平洋戰爭上獲得勝利的全要任務應由美國負担。」</p>
<p>美艦隊從中途島直接攻擊日本的心臟部，有太平洋上日本海事的存在，實不足慮。但鮑爾溫這論文的主旨，有下面二點値得注目：</p>
<p>第一，暴國美國關於軍慶抗戰力的錯覺，而說明其樂觀。論毫無根據。</p>
<p>第二，重要的結論指出：決定大東亞戰爭的勝敗者，在海軍並空軍。</p>
<p>且英美今後對重慶增强物資並技術者的結果，將助長敵人對緬滇日本軍的蠢動。最後，關於英美軍的對日水陸二路作戰的目標，倍倫的聯合報舉出（一）有長大的海岸綫的馬來半島及蘇門答臘，爪哇；（二）拉蒲爾；（三）中途島三地點。並觀涮將在這三地點的附近展開決定的海空戰。（翔：譯自十二月二日西部期日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c47">世界的地獄　西南太平洋戰綫視察記 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>前線雨夜</p>
<p>當我們飛抵該處以前，剛剛下過一陣大雨，所以滑走路以外的趣方，完全是泥沼也似的。幸而當地陸軍部隊司令巴契少將派來一輛小型軍用汽車，於是我們坐着汽車駛向他的司令部去。所謂司令部者，也不過是在路遠的山谷間搭着營帳而巳。它和飛行塲相距沒有多少路。</p>
<p>在瓜遠爾卡拿爾和新幾內亞進行着的太平洋戰爭，和我經騐到的前次大戰比較一下，實在是截然不同的。在這裏沒有到巴黎去的那種樂事，將軍們也沒有豪華的古堡可住，舒適的汽車可坐。至於一般整備員們，更是赤着一雙足在工作的。</p>
<p>這時適値雨季開始。在這島上，雨季中的雨量據說違五十糎之多，所以帳蓬，衣服，皮鞋，沒有一樣不被雨水浸透。瘧疾赤痢，趁此機會肆虐。巴契司令也就是睡在營帳中的吊床上的。他穿的是沒有肩軍的寛上衣（Gumqer）。</p>
<p>我雖不打算自誇，也以戰術家自居，但深感在這種孤島上所展開的這種作戰，是否能在別的地點再來一次，是很有疑問的。代價是太高了！而且也是太費時問的作戰！這樣一個孤島，其本身的價値決不能夠和海兵隊員一人的生命相等。可是，我們是在那裏打仗了，並且將它作為飛行基地，確保了通向此島的海上運輸綫。用遠大的眼光看，最便宜的方法就是動員充分的兵力，突入日軍保持着的各島的連鎖中，一舉取得三個乃至四個飛行場。如果採取這種作戰，那末我個將可使用更多的飛行塲，結果，攻擊力也可迅速集結了吧。而且，如能一度整備這種態勢，那末威脅日軍的補給綫也容易得多了。</p>
<p>在瓜達爾卡拿爾島上住宿的一夜，竟是終夜不息的大雨之夜。雨點打蓬帳的聲音，和　羣的獲　，獲得人不能入眠片刻。此處距離　前綫僅二、三理，大砲和機關槍的聲音，很淸晰地傳入耳鼓，但因降雨的緣故，不會體騐到日軍轟炸的况味。</p>
<p>今非昔比</p>
<p>翌晨，天瞧着是會晴了，我就從原路歸退基地。瓜達爾卡拿爾視察行雖然無事而終，但載我歸來的「空中堡壘」中，它的乘員以及它所搭載的將士們，却都有着種種經騐。有幾個曾經被十五、六架日本戰鬥機所逼迫，不得巳降落海上，好容易設法覓路歸來。的確，大平洋上的空戰可說是最最劇烈的戰鬥了。重轟炸機的樂員，在敵方制空　連續飛上十小時十二小時的事情，早就不算　奇了，而且來去都是在日機攻擊下的。因此、神經疲勞非常。駕駛着重轟炸機的　　士，都是廿三，四歲的年輕人，至於射手，年齡更小，大多是些十九或二十歲的靑年；這很使我驚詫。</p>
<p>在二十五年前的四都戰綫，這樣的事是沒有的。那時，操縱士都帶着騎士氣　出陣。精美的食物也祗要放開肚皮吃好了。休息也很充分。　要想得出，便沒有一個　　不可飛行的飛行士進攻，更是敵我雙方大家道守着的一條不成文法。在這次戰爭中，這樣的「童話」是完全不存在的。</p>
<p>多多益善</p>
<p>這趟視察旅行完了後，我要反問的就是：我們已經盡了責任　？不論跑到何處，我都聽到當地的部隊要求將各種東四多送一點到前綫去。更多的飛機，更多的戰車，更多的大砲，更多的彈藥，更多的醫藥用品！在他們，富有的美國爲什麽不多送一些東西給他們用，是不能夠諒解的。</p>
<p>在這裏，我要重述一遍以前說過的話，就是：倘若我們能夠從世界第一的地獻之穴　囘軍隊，叫兵士到工廠中去工作，替出那班工廠工人，命他們到這個充滿污穢，害虫，惡疫，以及日軍猛攻的前綫去，那末，生產一定可以增加。恐怕在一個月內生產就可加倍！說出這種話，或許會被稱作「勞　者之敵」也謂可知，不過，祗要一見到新綫內亞和瓜達爾卡拿爾的實際情形，就可知道工錢呀，勞動時間呀，養老年金等等都是算不來什麽問題的。我們在此一戰中，如果不勝，便紙有敗北！如不生產，那更必負無疑！（完）（吉：譯自十二月二日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 鷹</p>
<p>左先生決心去找個　姨。</p>
<p>說，這年頭。凡事以節省為宜的，而况如今正在提倡節約運動，而况報戶口等等：手續異常麻煩，而况——再來一個况　！——誰都　得的，現在米糧多貴！？</p>
<p>可是我們底主人決心要去找，一千多洋錢一月，兩口子，用上一個娘姨、無論如何該不算奢侈吧？——難道提倡節約的先生們底太太都是眞的什麽事親自動手麽？</p>
<p>何况左太太腰身漸潮粗了，據說就打在隊月里，無論如何左先生也得去找個娘姨萬一驚動了胎氣怎麽辦？——左先生行年而立，還沒有一個兒女！「不孝有三，無後為大」的話雖屬過時，但公餘之暇，確也希望有個把小天使</p>
<p>何先生「介紹」了一個娘姨來，三十來歲，在，三個小時以後，走了。原因是從師母那裏得來消息，這裏難得又一囘馬將，先生也不喜歡應酬，不大送禮。</p>
<p>左先生嘆口氣：</p>
<p>「難道要我為她天天請客麽？」</p>
<p>太太正在掃地，粗壯的腰身慢慢地抬起來：</p>
<p>「算了吧！還是我自巳來　」</p>
<p>「不行：」先生幾乎是光火了：「無論如何萬萬不能再勞動下去！化個百兒八十的是小事，壞了身體可怎麽辦？——我明天再去找！」</p>
<p>明天，左先生果然去找了；天保佑，他很快地就找到，是在薦頭店裏找來的，才從鄕下來，工錢也合左先生意。</p>
<p>到家，太太也覺符很如意，扛北娘姨究竟才從鄕下來，似乎還不大明白上海的時勢；她旣不間又馬將，也不大聽所喜歡應酬，更使先生和師母覺得滿意的，這娘姨不象一般上海娘姨的惡習慣，不大站在門口和別人家的談空話，左先生和太太覺得這是最好的一件事。</p>
<p>能吃苦，肯做事，不倫懶；一點不馬虎地說：這是一個好娘姨。</p>
<p>好娘姨做了三天，拿了半個月的工錢是了。原因是：左太太發覺，娘姨才來了三天，缸　的杜米已經去了一半，吃　之下，告訴了先生。</p>
<p>先生可嚇了一大跳。</p>
<p>「　還了得！難道米是偷」來的！？」</p>
<p>「鄕下人倒底肚子大，」太太解釋着；並且　了例：「我們家裏以前曾用了一個娘姨，一頓要吃三升米。」</p>
<p>「我們明天吃苞米。吃山芋，吃……」先生氣憤地。</p>
<p>「還不是一樣麽？」太太苦着臉：「你總不能將她肚皮壓得小！」</p>
<p>討論結果：為了杜米也為了將來孩子的口糧請娘姨另行高就；娘姨雖好，也願不得許多了。</p>
<p>這間，左先生總算心滿意足了。</p>
<p>余太太到底是患難知己，娘姨還要親自送來。這使主人和主婦異常感激；新娘姨一聲不響，只管做事，比江北娘姨差不多多少。</p>
<p>晚上，先生和太太不約而問地注意新娘姨吃飯，結果，大出意料地只吃了一碗，只有左先生的三分之一。先生謝天謝地，太太放下了心，替未來的小天使結絨綫衫去了。</p>
<p>第二天就有一個男人帶着七八歲得孩子來找新娘姨，太太看見娘姨告訴她，那是她的丈夫和孩子，丈夫沒生意做，孩子還生着病。</p>
<p>娘姨底丈夫和孩子這裏吃了一頓夜飯</p>
<p>「應該去找個事做做！」太太關心地說。</p>
<p>「叫他以後少來來！」先生呌太太轉告：「米糧這麼貴，我可供應不起！」</p>
<p>太太是個好心腸，沒說，但以後也沒來過，只是娘姨做事不大起勁，像　了氣得皮球似的。</p>
<p>那一天，娘姨的男人一個子來了而且在廚房裏商量了老半天以後，娘姨怱怱地到樓上來。</p>
<p>「先生……太太……！我有……一件事……」</p>
<p>「恩？」先生在寫信，抬起頭。</p>
<p>「我……我那……男的……又來了，……他說……他打算跟人合股做小本生意……擺油汆山芋餅……大概一個人攤二百塊錢，……他才湊好一百，還有一百……只要一百……，先生太太，……」娘姨急急巴巴地說了一大堆，陪着笑，紅着臉。</p>
<p>「能靠得住賺麽？」太太問。</p>
<p>可是先生斬釘截鐵地說：</p>
<p>「我沒有餘錢！而且……而且」……</p>
<p>娘姨幾乎要跪下來，他哭着臉說着如果先生和太太不幫忙，他們父子倆就要餓死了，男的自從廠裏停了工，半年沒事做了，這囘，這囘，……</p>
<p>「這囘總算…總算好機會，只要二百塊錢，…………」</p>
<p>先生凝起　子，出去了。</p>
<p>傍晚左先生回來太太開了門，立刻慌慌張張地告訴丈夫娘姨逃了。</p>
<p>「逃了！」先生大吃一驚。</p>
<p>於是太太擺動粗大的腰身，急促地告訴先生娘姨怎樣地苦苦哀求，當他走了以後；自己怎樣地婉韓地問地，最後總算也給了五十塊，可是娘姨還好像不夠，終於，不知怎麽一來。娘姨就不見了。</p>
<p>「我還以為她去買什麽東西，可是一查……」</p>
<p>「少了什麽東四？」左先生　斷她。</p>
<p>「我一查，你底一條在晒臺上晒的四裝褲不見了，忘了帶出去的錶也不見了，……」</p>
<p>左先生發暈似地倒在椅子上。</p>
<p>那邊，太太抱歉地垂下頭，眼光落到自己底隆起的肚皮上。</p>
<h3 id="c51">燈話 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 儀宜</p>
<p>黄　的燈下，是何等宜於閒談；何况在這初冬的夜，它如新寡的少婦，滿蘊着哀怨，深懷着悽愴，在微凉的空氣中，　上一層霧樣的輕愁，慢慢的蕩漾上人們的心胸：於是詩人的筆下，寫出了悱惻的詩篇；樂師的弦上，彈出了悒擊的音調，雖是燈下尋常的閒談，也寓有着無窮的感慨</p>
<p>「道燈光曾多次照臨過我們的聚談，但都巳十無從捉摸的陳跡，今晚的對話，到了明天，又可在囘憶之錄上增加一頁，人生是太無定了！」</p>
<p>「明天巳是這樣的渺茫，明年我們也許將天各一方，也許將白骨一堆，人生是太空虛了！」</p>
<p>「睜開眼，一夜已過去丁；閉上眼，一天又過去了；睜與閉之問，溜走了童年，逝去了壯年，到末了，只剩下一坯黄土，人生是太短促了！」</p>
<p>「誰能使時光永駐，生命永存，我們今晚的聚會、也可綿綿無盡。</p>
<p>「但是寧珍貴碎玉、毋重視全瓦；　囘三十三歲死，却能博得孔子的痛悼，「賢哉囘也！」强如千歲百齡，老死　下，與草木同朽；所以羣居終日，言不及義、雖是綿綿無盡的長談、還不如偶然的相晤，互勉互勵。」</p>
<p>可惜，即使創造了勳功偉業，結果呢，「大江東去，浪淘盡千古風流人物，」誰能逃得了死的掌握。」</p>
<p>「雖然，沒有人能逃得了死；可是所創的事業，所現的精神，到底是被後人歌頌着；否則千百年後，誰能知道這世上曾有個你來？」</p>
<p>「因此，我覺得，人生不能留芳百世，就常遺奧萬年，不然，是太平凡了！」</p>
<p>「不，這話錯了，自古以來，多少亂臣賊子，憑藉着這句話而為非作惡，禍國殃民；人，生不能有益於世，至少該無害於人；個人的名，事小；大衆的利，事大；所以，不能留芳百世，就庸　碌碌地死吧！」</p>
<p>我疑然，肅然；我明白了生的意義·與死的得失。</p>

<h3 id="c54">西靑藍球形勢　華聯唯我獨尊　劉家將不敵東方　蒙納克敗於同仁 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>四靑甲組籃球，上週保持不收紀錄者，為華聯華南及　納克三隊而巳。然經上週三　作　之結果，保持不敗紀錄者，僅剩華聯一隊而已。照情理，論實力，自以華聯為最佔上風，唯以後勁敵尙多，華南，東方，均有雄師强兵，務必戰戰兢競，謹愼從事，則一帆風順，球迷共所盼累，努力以赴，勉哉華聯。兹略述上週戰情列後：</p>
<p>週一之夕華南稱雄</p>
<p>第一尙為仁餘對大華。後者近　前輩陸鎭恩朝夕訓　，球藝蒸蒸日上，共不足者，火氣之不能脫盡耳。餘老將威風，唯投籃均欠把握，乃僅以三十六——三十小勝焉。第二幕為華南對油隊之戰、兩隊均係後起之秀·戰　緊張異常，華南終以技高一着，長力充足，三十七—廿九壓倒力爭向上之油隊。</p>
<p>週三二仗華聯發狠</p>
<p>甲塲免一仗，為上週擊敗巨人之華聯隊對抗老弱殘兵之三輸隊，實力懸殊。三輸猶車之脫軌，華聯之急轉直下，孔廣益，瞿錫　如入無人之境，　學崇，吳成章左右逢源，輕描淡寫，七十六對廿一，為本屆甲組第一次懸殊之比數。第二仗地頭蛇巨人對業餘，業餘　鬱不得志，亦在乎人頭不齊，陶紹生欲振作而無從，乃以廿九—五十四業餘再敗一次，巨人理得二分。</p>
<p>週五之戰兩强均北</p>
<p>斯夜，球塲空氣，又非常熱烈，兩支常勝軍，均告潰退，東方顯　色，阿包有道理，　家班奮勇宣俊顯神技，球迷掌聲如雷，西靑球房，今年特別興旺。</p>
<p>東方自不幸敗於同仁後，知所檢點，此次又逢高保生·許文奎·王鏡瑚·張少鄕·包松圓五虎將臨陣，華南氣燄雖盛，經騐較差·阿奎阿包，更暢所欲為，東方前途，又現曙光，華南健兒第一次低頭，比數為四一，二七，</p>
<p>同仁上週一鼓足氣，活擒東方，一躍而為不可輕侮之隊。蒙納克戰績上未見收績，且有巨人凱旋密洛夫之從中策劃，自非等閒之輩，乃宣家班不負羣衆鼓勵之烈，賴張邦綸之勇宣俊之左手連射，奠，卅七，僅多四分，亦云險矣。（端）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Conserving Electricity <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the two power companies in Central China and Shanghai have, due to difficulties in sourcing coal and in order to practice wartime living, stipulated measures to restrict electricity consumption. We advocate that, apart from production enterprises and social service undertakings that must maintain their minimum electricity needs, the restrictive measures should be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the municipal government of this city also formulated four measures for conserving electricity, to be implemented from January 1 next year. We observe that the four measures formulated by the municipal government are, in principle, absolutely well-intentioned and should be earnestly implemented. We hope that related shops and entertainment venues will start implementing them immediately, without waiting until January 1 next year, and will voluntarily comply with conservation, without the need for forced restrictions. At the same time, we hope that the municipal government will not only formulate conservation measures but also enact restrictive laws, with penalties for violators. We must not only use persuasion to conserve electricity but also enforce it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the lights-off time in the measures formulated by the municipal government, we believe that it can be advanced further, especially for entertainment venues such as amusement parks, theaters, dance halls, and tea houses. Even if they are not completely abolished during wartime, their hours should be shortened as much as possible. Those who are busy with work during the day must have sufficient rest at night. Although entertainment can reduce and restore fatigue, excessive indulgence will inevitably be mentally and financially draining, and a waste of time. Therefore, restricting the business hours of entertainment venues not only saves electricity but also saves people's energy and money. In this time of war, its significance is even greater.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Christmas and Winter Relief <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The annual Christmas holiday is fast approaching. According to custom, believers will certainly celebrate by exchanging gifts and decorations, and even non-believers who are fashionable will take the opportunity to have fun and party all night. General stores and entertainment venues will be especially creative in attracting customers.</p>
<p>However, this year's situation is different. We know that the Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and China's participation in the war is approaching its first year. We are getting closer and closer to the decisive stage. In this tense era, we must greet this extraordinary time with extraordinary emotions and actions. All extravagant customs and conventions must not be continued. This year, for Christmas, we hope that believers and non-believers will all abolish customs, not exchange gifts, not revel, and that stores and entertainment venues will also abolish and reduce consumption-inducing business methods to practice the extraordinary life of wartime.</p>
<p>We respect religious freedom, but we also oppose using the holiday to revel and spend lavishly during this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>For this year's Christmas, we would like to propose two things that we hope Christians will implement, and that non-Christians can also implement, in order to jointly express remembrance:</p>
<p>First, to strictly practice thrift and abolish customs, save all the expenses for preparing gifts and entertainment, and donate them to winter relief.</p>
<p>Second, to commemorate Christmas with compassion. During this severe winter, our suffering compatriots are in urgent need of relief. Enthusiastically donate to winter relief, which can relieve the suffering of our compatriots, is the best expression of commemorating Christmas.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Fierce Battles in Nevel and the South, German Counterattack Has Made Progress <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) Soviet troops inside. They dispatched 14 infantry divisions, two major tank regiments, and one artillery division to fiercely attack German positions, posing a great threat of encirclement. In two days, Soviet troops attacked 34 times, losing as many as 65 tanks. The intensity of the fierce battle is not difficult to imagine. Military experts believe that the focal point of the battle is in the southwest of Nevel, which was originally a line of sight, but has recently formed a winding shape due to mutual advances and retreats. German commanders believe that the southern defenses need to be slightly withdrawn, and after a counterattack in the north, the Germans have made progress. There have been major battles near Keguo, Zhuo, and Cherkassy. The focal point of the battle is north of Kirovograd. The Germans believe that the swift German counterattack has prevented the Soviet army from gaining time to develop its military according to its planned plan.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) Haisong News Agency reports: Although the forests along the Nevel area hinder the battle, fierce fighting is still ongoing there. German military sources say Soviet troops are using aircraft, artillery, and tanks to assist the offensive, apparently to push back German troops near the highway leading south to Nevel. Soviet troops cut off communication between the German vanguard and the main force, but were repulsed, and the German vanguard has regained contact with the main force.</p>

This is the real picture of the development of the Anglo-American offensive in southern Italy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) German authorities announced that since the landing of British and American forces in Italy, it is estimated that there have been about 150,000 casualties.

<h3 id="e23">Military Police Clash in Front of the Gong Wu Stage Leads to Bloody Tragedy; Tax Police Regiment Thoroughly Investigates the Truth <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday, a clash occurred between military personnel and police in front of the Gong Wu Stage on Great Shanghai Road in the Eighth District of the city, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Ten officers from the Taishan Road Precinct were killed or injured, and the police defense section chief, Ji Jingyang, also died in the line of duty. More than ten soldiers from the Central Tax Police Regiment were also injured. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>The Main Cause of the Incident Was Provocation</p>
<p>The main cause of the incident was that a portion of the Central Tax Police Regiment, stationed in the South City district, went to the Gong Wu Stage in the Eighth District to watch a play on the 18th. A dispute arose over ticket purchases, almost leading to a major incident. Upon learning of this, the Taishan Road Precinct immediately dispatched a large contingent of police officers to the scene to suppress the situation. They took the offending soldiers to the precinct and subsequently released them. Afterwards, the Tax Police Regiment commander, Luo Junqiang, and deputy commander, Xiong Jiandong, upon learning of the incident, were conducting a thorough investigation. Unexpectedly, a small number of soldiers, feeling aggrieved by their detention, rushed to the Gong Wu Stage at around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon to provoke a fight, leading to the tragic bloodshed.</p>
<p>Attempt to Suppress Leads to Bloodshed</p>
<p>The soldiers who instigated the trouble were part of the Second Battalion of the Tax Police Regiment. They departed from the South City area at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, entered the Eighth District through various iron gates, and gathered in full battle gear in front of the Gong Wu Stage on Great Shanghai Road. They began by surrounding the Gong Wu Stage and dispersing pedestrians. The Taishan Road Precinct received a report and, fearing a worsening situation, sent police defense section chief Ji Jingyang with officers from the reserve squad to attempt to suppress the unrest. However, as soon as the police arrived, the conflict erupted. In an instant, gunshots rang out, and the surrounding area descended into chaos as pedestrians scattered. In a matter of moments, several people lay in pools of blood in front of the Gong Wu Stage. Twenty minutes before the tragedy, Zhang Shankun, the manager of the Gong Wu Stage, noticed soldiers loitering near the entrance and, sensing something amiss, immediately called Deputy Commander Xiong Jiandong. Xiong, upon learning this, immediately drove to the Gong Wu Stage with five guards, attempting to prevent the incident. However, as soon as Xiong's vehicle arrived, the shooting started, and he was unable to stop it.</p>
<p>Both Military and Police Suffered Casualties</p>
<p>After the incident, shops near the Gong Wu Stage, unaware of the true situation, closed their doors and ceased operations. The Taishan Road Precinct immediately dispatched ambulances to transport those lying in the blood to Guangci Hospital for treatment. A total of five police officers were killed at the scene, two were arrested, and several were injured. Stray bullets injured two passersby. Ji Jingyang, the police defense section chief of the Taishan Precinct, who was about thirty years old, unfortunately died in the line of duty. It is reported that Ji had been married only recently and left behind an elderly mother and a weak wife. The tragedy is especially devastating. On the Tax Police Regiment side, ten soldiers were also injured and were immediately sent to the Central Police Hospital for treatment by the Tax Police Regiment. A Central News Agency reporter learned from the Taishan Road Precinct yesterday that the police officers killed were numbers 125, 56, 833, 220, and 121. The two officers arrested were numbers 52 and 15. Although the other injured officers were being treated, half of them sustained severe injuries.</p>
<p>Municipal Authorities Issue Statement</p>
<p>The municipal authorities issued a statement regarding the military-police clash in the Eighth District yesterday: "The previous evening, soldiers from the Tax Police Regiment went to the Gong Wu Stage to watch a play. A minor dispute arose over ticket purchases and seating arrangements. Efforts to resolve the matter at the police station were unsuccessful, leading a few troublemakers to take advantage of the situation. They gathered their comrades on the occasion of their regular Sunday leave, using the pretext of military drills to bring weapons and provoke a fight. At that time, Zhang Shankun, the manager of the Gong Wu Stage, invited Xiong Jiandong, the deputy commander of the Tax Police Regiment, to personally suppress the situation, but the disaster had already begun. The soldiers, both military and police, who died or were injured, are estimated to be about ten each. Two passersby were injured, which is extremely unfortunate. However, this incident originated from provocation and has no other implications. The police immediately intervened to block traffic and stop the violence, and order was restored after one hour. The soldiers who caused the trouble will be punished according to the law."</p>
<p>Tax Police Authorities Issue Statement</p>
<p>The Tax Police headquarters issued a statement regarding the military-police clash in the Eighth District yesterday: "Regarding the incident in which soldiers from our regiment caused a major misunderstanding due to the purchase of tickets for a play, leading to a clash between military and police, the general course of events is as described by the municipal authorities. This unfortunate incident is deeply regrettable, and we are particularly concerned about the alarm caused to the citizens. The authorities in charge of this regiment have telegraphed the relevant authorities to request punishment and will investigate the soldiers involved and punish them according to the law. The units stationed in Shanghai have been strictly ordered to restrain themselves and prevent further disturbances."</p>
<p>Anhe Steamer Encountered Another Danger</p>
<p>It has also been learned that another steamer narrowly escaped sinking at Xinkang on the 14th of this month. The "Anhe" steamer of the China Steamer Company arrived at Xinkang at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month. Thirty to forty small boats carrying passengers swarmed the ship's sides, causing the ship to tilt dangerously. Fortunately, Allied warships anchored nearby sounded the alarm, allowing the ship to safely return to Shanghai. It is hoped that the relevant navigation authorities will pay attention to the recurring dangers involving this steamer and take appropriate precautions to ensure safety and protect lives.</p>
<p>Statistics on Casualties from the Huatai Disaster</p>
<p>According to the company, the total number of crew and passengers lost and rescued from the "Huatai" steamer disaster is as follows: (Crew) Total of 80, rescued 32, missing 48. (Passengers) 574 departing from Shanghai, 115 disembarking at various intermediate ports, 230 boarding, totaling 689 passengers on board at that time. 100 disembarked before the disaster, leaving approximately 500 passengers on board upon arrival at Xinkang. Approximately 400-500 people boarded from small boats at Xinkang. Approximately 350 people were rescued afterward. According to the above statistics, the number of missing persons is approximately 700-800.</p>
<p>Crew Members Recount the Disaster</p>
<p>According to Zhang Qing, the second mate of the ill-fated Huatai steamer, who was rescued, the course of the ship's disaster was as follows: "The Huatai was running between Shanghai and Xinkang for the 56th time. It arrived at Xinkang at 6:30 PM on the 9th. At that time, each passenger carried an average of a dozen empty kerosene cans, two or three empty bamboo baskets, seven or eight cans of peanut oil, two or three packages of lard and provisions, and large bamboo baskets. It departed from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 8th with 17 pieces of cargo and 574 passengers. 30 passengers disembarked at Shiyiwei, without unloading cargo. At Zhanghuanggang and Xinshenggang, 15 pieces of cargo were unloaded, and 115 passengers disembarked. At Xinkang, 459 passengers disembarked. Along the way, 100 cans of peanut oil, 3-4 dan of peanuts, and 1-2 cages of chickens and ducks were loaded, along with 230 passengers. An unexpected incident occurred: it ran aground at Shiyiwei, delaying departure by approximately three hours. Also, after departing from Zhanghuanggang, two gunshots were heard from the right bank, and someone on the shore waved a flag ordering the ship to stop, but it was ignored. The disaster occurred at 6:00 PM on the 9th when it arrived at Xinkang. Two boxes of wool blankets were unloaded, along with 459 passengers. Then the ship tilted 80 degrees and sank."</p>

The investigation of yarn and cloth has come to an end. The types of materials to be investigated in the future are still being reported to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the committee has recently seen a resurgence of rising prices of materials in this city, inevitably affected by speculators, which greatly affects people's livelihood. Therefore, the committee has specifically scheduled the seventh committee meeting for the afternoon of the 24th of this month, gathering Chinese and Japanese members to discuss requesting the Executive Yuan to accelerate the investigation of essential goods for people's livelihood, in order to achieve the effect of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Authorities Convene Seminars for Various Industries</p>
<p>Last week (from the 13th to the 19th), the average price of all goods was raised by eight or nine tenths again. Among them, food and fuel, essential goods for people's livelihood, had the highest price increase. Secondary goods were also increased in price, stimulated by the high prices of the above two items. Recently, in order to understand the situation of various industries and obtain reliable data, the authorities have repeatedly convened leaders of various industries to hold seminars. In addition to earnestly advising compliance with business ethics, they also discussed how to stabilize the prices of goods in those industries and inquired about the current sources and transportation methods of those items.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Old Title Deeds Should Be Exchanged for Land Practice Certificates Promptly <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Land Administration Bureau began to measure land by household using the latest methods starting in 1927. All old land sections that have been surveyed were announced successively starting in 1930, exchanging land practice certificates and collecting miscellaneous military evidence. These land practice certificates have detailed and accurate diagrams. Even if the actual land boundaries are unfortunately obliterated, the Land Administration Bureau can verify them according to the diagrams. There are now many citizens who use old title deeds for buying and selling, which not only makes their property rights uncertain but also provides no protection if they are deceived. Therefore, according to the Land Administration Bureau, only the land practice certificate can be used to transfer registration in the areas that have been announced for exchange. The land practice certificate should be exchanged with the Land Administration Bureau before purchasing. For the exchange procedures, the land tax and compliant grain claims should be submitted to the Land Administration Bureau. After the bureau reviews and confirms that there are no errors, it will issue a draft of the surveyed land topographic map. The owner can proofread it themselves. If they deem it correct, they should sign and seal it and return it to the Land Administration Bureau. The Land Administration Bureau will then issue the land practice certificate.</p>

<p>The names of accounting subjects used by various financial institutions in this city are not standardized. Some have the same name but different meanings, and some have the same meaning but different names. This not only affects the efficiency of operations but also hinders the unified management of finance. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of this, specially conducted a detailed study of the names of accounting subjects adopted by various financial institutions, compiling statistics over several months. A draft has now been prepared, and it is scheduled to convene a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month with experienced accountants from some banks, financial firms, trust companies, and savings banks in Shanghai to discuss and exchange opinions, with the aim of standardizing the names of accounting subjects. It is reported that the standardization of the names of accounting subjects in financial institutions will make a great contribution to the development of finance in the future.</p>

<p>The paper, a key item for the cultural sector, has seen prices rise continuously in recent years due to intermittent sources, causing panic and a shortage. However, this phenomenon is expected to end, as paper mills in this city are able to become self-sufficient by using reeds from around the Yangtze River as raw materials. The quality is also very good. For example, the Jiangnan Paper Mill uses this kind of papermaking raw material to produce more than ten tons per month. It is now known that the Dongyang Paper Company also intends to adopt this method. There is a large amount of these reeds along the Yangtze River. Therefore, the fear of paper shortage will soon change, and the black market price is expected to decrease.</p>

<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial situations in Shanghai City were still stable last week, but due to the absorption behavior of investors and the resurgence of speculators, trading became increasingly active in secret, and illegal market prices rose indefinitely. Prices of various daily necessities, such as rice, grains, oil, sugar, and fuel, all increased in a straight line. This change stimulated people's livelihood and caused daily unease. Fortunately, the authorities are paying close attention, actively investigating the reasons, and formulating restrictive measures for company capital increases and value increases, cracking down on market manipulation and market chaos. The various control agencies are actively seeking ways to unblock the supply and demand of daily necessities.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Common Red Dates: Recently, the source has slightly decreased, and the status is flatter than before. The cost has increased, so the asking price of the customer has gradually increased. Yesterday, I heard that a good batch was opened from 50 yuan to 100 yuan, but the market was flat, and Zhu Guoang was still there. At the same time, Tianjin Beichen Dusheng Red Dates, which are especially high, are even tighter due to the scarcity of goods.</p>
<p>Longkou Noodles: Wire noodles and dry winter sales have been launched, and the cost of foreign transportation has increased. Therefore, the Shanghai market has also increased accordingly. The degree of increase has been close to 10%. It has been found that the conversion of ordinary goods is weak, only a slight increase.</p>
<p>Jinshan Branches: Before, due to sluggish conversion, they would fall back by more than 10%, but the source is very difficult, and the inventory is not thick. In addition, the actual sales have become active in recent days, and the price has become tight again. The current market has returned to its original state and has the potential to become tighter again.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Future Pacific Strategy <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hanson Baldwin, the military reporter for the New York Times, recently inspected the Pacific and Asian battle lines and returned to the United States. He wrote an essay on Pacific strategy, which won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism. This essay, unlike the empty pronouncements of U.S. Navy Secretary Knox, carefully examines the future direction the United States should take in the war against Japan, suggesting the future direction of American strategy against Japan, which is quite noteworthy. New Strategic Theory</p>
<p>New Strategic Theory</p>
<p>Baldwin began by saying sharply: "The United States openly claims to believe that the Chongqing government is gradually gaining victory, which is nonsense." He then reviewed the attacks on Japan from the mainland, with his views as follows:</p>
<p>"The general American belief that the morale of the Chongqing army is good is entirely due to the completely false impressions given by reports from missionaries stationed in the Chongqing area, the Chongqing relief fund movement, and propaganda films. We cannot overlook the weaknesses of the Chongqing regime. China, in general, is not the China we commonly imagine; it is merely a geographical concept. The Chongqing regime cannot win against Japan, nor will it win in the future war against Japan. The army has not won in battle but has failed. Japan has not been defeated in China. Japan has not only won in the war but has also gained valuable experience in the war against Britain and the United States. The war communiqués issued by the Chongqing regime are of little value. If the Japanese army had truly lost half the number of troops that Chongqing claims, Japan would now be feeling a shortage of troops.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Isolation</p>
<p>Of course, supplying weapons to the Chongqing regime is necessary, but under the Chongqing regime, there is no army that can truly be called an army. Most of the troops are poorly trained and lack the ability to use modern weapons. They need long-term training and courageous commanders. On the other hand, Japan controls all the bays and transportation routes in China, and has seized the most important mineral resources in North China, so Japan's economic position has also been strengthened. In short, even in the future, it is impossible for the Chongqing army to drive the Japanese army out of China. If Britain and the United States want to fight a decisive battle against the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, they must supply China with a lot of weapons, other military supplies, and troops. To win a victory against the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, we must station a large army in China and build many large airfields to bomb the Japanese mainland. Not only must we train a large number of Chongqing troops who are truly like an army, but the British and American armies themselves must also send a large number of troops. However, the problem here is resupply, which can be seen as a difficult problem to solve. The area now under the Chongqing regime is completely isolated from the world. There is no other way than to cross the Himalayas from India by air, and the difficulty can be imagined. Airplanes must carry enough gasoline for the return trip. There are very few airfields there, and they are often hampered by seasonal winds. Although the U.S. Air Transport Command and China National Aviation Corporation operate the air route to Chongqing, their transportation capacity is reduced by one-third compared to the previous Burma Road, and they can only transport an average of 200 tons per day. Even if the transportation is gradually increasing, assuming it can reach three times the amount of the Yunnan-Burma Road at the time, it would not be enough to resupply the large army that Britain and the United States expect to have on the Chinese mainland. Each division needs 1,000 tons of military supplies per day in battle. To isolate Japan from the mainland, it is necessary to recapture all of China's ports. To bomb the Japanese mainland and drive the Japanese army out of China, the anti-Axis forces must have a large army and a large-scale air force in mainland China. Therefore, recapturing Burma is of great significance."</p>
<p>The Issue of Resupplying China</p>
<p>Moreover, Baldwin is pessimistic about the issue of resupplying China. In his view, "The reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is a major problem." That is to say, the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road cannot solve the problem of resupplying Chongqing. No matter how it is done, the transportation volume of the Yunnan-Burma Road can at most be increased by two to three times, which is not enough to resupply the expeditionary force with the aforementioned mission. In addition, all the ports that can load and unload 1,000 to 2,000 tons per day are in the hands of the Japanese army, so Baldwin said: "It is impossible to recapture these ports unless a large-scale amphibious operation is carried out at the same time." He concluded:</p>
<p>"To defeat Japan, it is necessary to break through by land and sea at the same time. Japanese fortresses must be attacked simultaneously from Australia, the Solomon Islands, the Aleutian Islands, India, and Chongqing. However, the main offensive route should be a westward advance operation with Hawaii and Midway as bases, first directly attacking the heart of Japan. There is no need for the Chongqing army to play a decisive role. The United States should bear the entire task of winning the Pacific War."</p>
<p>The US fleet directly attacking the heart of Japan from Midway, with the existence of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific, is not worth worrying about. However, the main points of Baldwin's essay are worth noting:</p>
<p>First, he exposes the illusions of the United States regarding Chongqing's anti-Japanese strength and explains that its optimism is groundless.</p>
<p>Second, the important conclusion points out that the naval and air forces will determine the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Moreover, the result of Britain and the United States increasing materials and technicians to Chongqing will encourage the enemy's activities against the Japanese army in Burma and Yunnan. Finally, regarding the targets of the British and American amphibious operations against Japan, the Berliner Tageblatt cited (1) the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, Java, which have long coastlines; (2) Rabaul; and (3) Midway Island. It also predicted that a decisive naval and air battle would be launched near these three locations. (Translated from the December 2nd issue of the Western Japan Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e47">The Hell of the World: A Visit to the Southwest Pacific Front <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Rainy Night on the Front Lines</p>
<p>When we flew to the location, it had just rained heavily, so the area outside the runway was completely like a mud swamp. Fortunately, Major General Patch, the commander of the local army unit, sent a small military vehicle, so we sat in the car and drove to his headquarters. The so-called headquarters was just a camp set up in a remote valley. It was not far from the airfield.</p>
<p>The Pacific War being waged in Guadalcanal and New Guinea is completely different from the previous Great War that I experienced. Here, there is no pleasure of going to Paris, and the generals do not have luxurious castles to live in or comfortable cars to ride in. As for the general maintenance personnel, they are working barefoot.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the rainy season. On this island, the rainfall during the rainy season is said to exceed 50 centimeters, so everything, including tents, clothes, and leather shoes, is soaked in rainwater. Malaria and dysentery take this opportunity to wreak havoc. Commander Patch was also sleeping in a hammock in a camp. He was wearing a wide shirt without shoulder straps (Gumqer).</p>
<p>Although I don't intend to boast, I also consider myself a tactician, but I feel that it is very doubtful whether this kind of operation carried out on such a isolated island can be repeated in another location. The price is too high! And it is also a very time-consuming operation! The value of such an isolated island cannot be equal to the life of a single Marine. However, we fought there and secured it as an air base, ensuring the sea transport line to this island. From a long-term perspective, the cheapest way is to mobilize sufficient troops and break into the chain of islands held by the Japanese army, and take three or four airfields in one fell swoop. If this operation is adopted, then I can use more airfields, and as a result, the attack power can be quickly concentrated, right? Moreover, if this kind of posture can be established once, then it will be much easier to threaten the Japanese army's supply line.</p>
<p>The night I stayed on Guadalcanal Island was a night of incessant heavy rain. The sound of raindrops hitting the tent, and the sound of mosquitoes, made it impossible for people to sleep for a moment. The front line was only two or three miles away, and the sound of cannons and machine guns was clearly transmitted to the eardrums, but because of the rain, I did not experience the taste of Japanese bombing.</p>
<p>Things Are Different Now</p>
<p>The next morning, it looked like the weather would clear up, so I returned to the base by the same route. Although the visit to Guadalcanal ended without incident, the crew of the "Flying Fortress" that carried me back, as well as the soldiers it carried, all had various experiences. Several had been forced to land at sea by fifteen or sixteen Japanese fighter planes and had managed to find their way back. Indeed, the air war in the Pacific can be said to be the most intense battle. It is no longer surprising for the crew of a heavy bomber to fly continuously for ten or twelve hours in enemy airspace, and they are attacked by Japanese planes both coming and going. Therefore, they are very nervous and fatigued. The officers piloting heavy bombers are young men of twenty-three or four years old, and the gunners are even younger, mostly young men of nineteen or twenty years old; this surprised me very much.</p>
<p>In the Four Power Line of twenty-five years ago, such a thing did not exist. At that time, pilots went into battle with a sense of chivalry. They could eat fine food as much as they wanted. They also had plenty of rest. It was an unwritten rule that no pilot who was unable to fly could attack, and both sides abided by it. In this war, such a "fairy tale" does not exist at all.</p>
<p>The More, the Better</p>
<p>After this inspection trip, I want to ask again: Have we fulfilled our responsibilities? No matter where I go, I hear local troops asking for more of various things to be sent to the front lines. More planes, more tanks, more cannons, more ammunition, more medical supplies! To them, they cannot understand why the wealthy United States does not send them more things to use.</p>
<p>Here, I want to repeat what I said before, that is: If we can take the troops back from the world's number one land of contribution, and call the soldiers to work in the factories, and replace the factory workers, and order them to go to this front line full of dirt, pests, epidemics, and fierce Japanese attacks, then production will definitely increase. I'm afraid production will double in a month! Saying this may be called "an enemy of labor," but if you see the actual situation in New Guinea and Guadalcanal, you will know that wages, working hours, old-age pensions, etc., are not worth calculating. If we do not win in this battle, we will only be defeated! If we do not produce, then there is no doubt that we will lose! (The End) (Translated from the December 2nd issue of the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>In response to the enemy who comes for guerrilla air raids every night, we openly use a large formation of 〇〇 planes to bomb the 〇〇 enemy base during the day. Now those planes are returning one after another. In front of a simple camp at a certain airfield, a staff member is reading the tail numbers of the planes that landed in order and marking them on the blackboard to see if there are any planes that have not returned. Except for the command plane, all the planes have returned safely.</p>
<p>"What about the commander's plane?"</p>
<p>The last pilot to land said:</p>
<p>"The commander is currently engaging with enemy planes in the rear."</p>
<p>"At 〇 o'clock 〇 minutes, we broke in and shot down 〇〇 planes, and our side was hit by several planes."</p>
<p>The young and excellent warrior who escaped from the line of death with bloodshot eyes answered faintly. "As long as the rear is stable, we will win the war." The words of Staff Officer 〇〇 can be fully experienced. (Yasuo Kobori) (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>— Hawk</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo decided to find an amah.</p>
<p>He said that in this day and age, it is appropriate to be economical in everything, especially since we are now promoting a thrift movement, and besides, the procedures for registering a household are extremely troublesome, and besides—one more besides!—everyone knows that rice is so expensive now!?</p>
<p>But our master is determined to find one. More than a thousand silver dollars a month, for a couple, using an amah should not be considered extravagant, right? Could it be that the wives of those who advocate thrift are really doing everything themselves?</p>
<p>What's more, Mrs. Zuo's waistline is gradually getting thicker. It is said that she is in the first month of her pregnancy, so Mr. Zuo must find an amah in case the pregnancy is disturbed. Mr. Zuo is in his thirties and still doesn't have any children! Although the saying "There are three forms of unfilial conduct, and the worst is to have no descendants" is outdated, he certainly hopes to have a few little angels in his spare time.</p>
<p>Mr. He "introduced" an amah, who was in her thirties, but after three hours, she left. The reason was that she got news from the mistress that it was rare for her to come back to serve again, and the master did not like to socialize or give gifts very much.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo sighed:</p>
<p>"Does she want me to entertain guests for her every day?"</p>
<p>His wife was sweeping the floor, slowly lifting her stout waist:</p>
<p>"Forget it! I'll just do it myself."</p>
<p>"No way!" The master was almost furious: "Under no circumstances can you continue to work! Spending a hundred or eighty dollars is a small matter, what if you hurt your body?—I'll find someone else tomorrow!"</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Zuo went to find someone else. Thank God, he found someone quickly at a broker's shop. She was just from the countryside, and the wage was to Mr. Zuo's liking.</p>
<p>When she arrived home, his wife also felt that she was very satisfactory. After all, the Jiangbei amah was just from the countryside and did not seem to understand the Shanghai situation very well. She neither gambled nor played mahjong, and did not like to socialize very much, which made the master and mistress even more satisfied. What made Mr. Zuo and his wife satisfied was that the amah did not have the bad habits of ordinary Shanghai amahs and did not stand at the door to chat with people from other families. Mr. Zuo and his wife felt that this was the best thing.</p>
<p>She could endure hardship, was willing to work, and was not lazy. Without exaggerating, she was a good amah.</p>
<p>The good amah worked for three days and took half a month's wage to leave. The reason was that Mrs. Zuo discovered that the amah had only been there for three days, and half of the rice in the jar was gone. Under pressure, she told her husband.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo was shocked.</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Is the rice stolen!?"</p>
<p>"People from the countryside have big stomachs after all," his wife explained, and gave an example: "We used to have an amah who ate three liters of rice per meal."</p>
<p>"We'll eat cornmeal tomorrow. We'll eat sweet potatoes, we'll eat..." the master said angrily.</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same?" his wife said with a bitter face, "You can't make her stomach smaller!"</p>
<p>After discussion, for the sake of rice and for the sake of the future child's food, they asked the amah to find another job. Although the amah was good, they couldn't afford so much.</p>
<p>During this time, Mr. Zuo was finally satisfied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu was truly a friend in need, and she even personally brought the amah. This made the master and mistress extremely grateful. The new amah did not say a word and only did her work, which was almost as good as the Jiangbei amah.</p>
<p>In the evening, the master and mistress noticed the new amah eating without discussing it beforehand. As a result, they were surprised to see that she only ate one bowl, only one-third of what Mr. Zuo ate. The master thanked God, the wife was relieved, and went to knit a wool sweater for the future little angel.</p>
<p>The next day, a man brought a seven or eight-year-old child to look for the new amah. The wife saw the amah tell her that it was her husband and child. The husband had no business to do, and the child was sick.</p>
<p>The amah's husband and child ate dinner here.</p>
<p>"You should go find something to do!" the wife said with concern.</p>
<p>"Tell him to come less often!" the master called to his wife to tell her, "Rice is so expensive, I can't afford to supply it!"</p>
<p>The wife was kind-hearted and didn't say anything, but they didn't come again after that. However, the amah didn't seem to be working very hard, like a deflated balloon.</p>
<p>One day, the amah's husband came alone and, after discussing for a long time in the kitchen, the amah hurried upstairs.</p>
<p>"Master... Mistress...! I have... something..."</p>
<p>"Hmm?" The master was writing a letter and looked up.</p>
<p>"I... my... man... came again,... he said... he plans to partner with someone to do a small business... selling deep-fried sweet potato cakes... probably two hundred dollars per person,... he has only collected one hundred, and there is still one hundred... just one hundred..., master, mistress,..." the amah said a lot in a hurry, smiling ingratiatingly, with a red face.</p>
<p>"Is it reliable and can you make money?" the wife asked.</p>
<p>But the master said categorically:</p>
<p>"I don't have any extra money! And... and..."...</p>
<p>The amah almost knelt down. She said with a crying face that if the master and mistress did not help, her father and son would starve to death. The man had been out of work since the factory closed down half a year ago. This time, this time,...</p>
<p>"This time, it's finally... finally a good opportunity, just two hundred dollars,..."</p>
<p>The master frowned and went out.</p>
<p>In the evening, Mr. Zuo came back, and the wife opened the door and hurriedly told her husband that the amah had run away.</p>
<p>"Run away!" The master was shocked.</p>
<p>Then the wife moved her stout waist and hurriedly told her husband how the amah had begged bitterly, and how she had gently and tactfully asked after he left, and finally gave her fifty dollars, but the amah still seemed to be not enough, and finally, somehow, the amah disappeared.</p>
<p>"I thought she went to buy something, but when I checked..."</p>
<p>"What's missing?" Mr. Zuo interrupted her.</p>
<p>"When I checked, your four-pocket pants that were drying on the drying rack were gone, and the watch that you forgot to take out was also gone,..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo fainted and fell into a chair.</p>
<p>Over there, the wife lowered her head apologetically, her eyes falling on her bulging belly.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Lamp Talks <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>How suitable it is to chat under the yellow light; especially on this early winter night, it is like a young widow, full of sorrow, deeply cherishing sadness, in the cool air, a layer of misty light sorrow covers people's hearts: so the poet's pen writes poignant poems; the musician's strings play melancholy tunes; even ordinary chats under the lamp contain endless emotions.</p>
<p>"The lamp light has shone on our gatherings many times, but they are all elusive traces of the past. Tonight's conversation will add another page to the book of memories tomorrow. Life is too uncertain!"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is so vague, and next year we may be scattered all over the world, or we may be a pile of white bones. Life is too empty!"</p>
<p>"Open your eyes, and the night has passed; close your eyes, and another day has passed; between opening and closing, childhood has slipped away, youth has passed, and in the end, there is only a pile of yellow soil left. Life is too short!"</p>
<p>"Who can make time stand still and life last forever, so that our gathering tonight can be endless?"</p>
<p>"But rather cherish broken jade than value whole tiles; Confucius lamented over Yan Hui's death at the age of thirty-three, saying, "How virtuous Hui is!" It is better to live a thousand years, grow old, and rot like grass and trees; therefore, although long talks are held all day long without mentioning righteousness, they are not as good as occasional meetings, where we encourage and exhort each other."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, even if we create great achievements, what will be the result? "The great river flows eastward, washing away the famous figures of a thousand ages," who can escape the grasp of death?"</p>
<p>"Although no one can escape death, the cause they created and the spirit they manifested are still praised by later generations; otherwise, after thousands of years, who will know that you ever existed in this world?"</p>
<p>"Therefore, I feel that if life cannot leave a fragrance for a hundred ages, it should leave a stench for ten thousand years; otherwise, it is too ordinary!"</p>
<p>"No, that's wrong. Since ancient times, how many rebellious officials and traitors have committed evil and harmed the country and the people by relying on this saying; if a person's life cannot benefit the world, at least it should not harm others; personal fame is a small matter; the public interest is a big matter; therefore, if you cannot leave a fragrance for a hundred ages, then die mediocrely!"</p>
<p>I was doubtful and solemn; I understood the meaning of life and the gains and losses of death.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Second Long-Distance Race: Deaf Person Lou Wen'ao Wins the Championship; Top Three Break the Previous Record <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The second annual citywide open long-distance race, organized by the Municipal Sports Association, began at 8:00 AM yesterday in front of the Municipal Government on Rue du Consulat (Bai Linan Road). The route went from Rue du Consulat to Avenue Haig (Zhen De Road), then turned into Jing'an Temple Road, followed by Route Maréchal Joffre (Ma Huo Road), Weihaiwei Road, Avenue Foch (Fu Xu Road), Route Tenant de la Tour (Ge Lu), Hongqiao Road, and finally entered Route Kaufmann (Kai Shi Road) before returning to the Rue du Consulat finish line. The entire course was 13,510 meters long, exactly the same as the first race. Yesterday morning, the weather was not sunny, and the fog was very heavy. When the reporter left his residence at 7:00 AM, he found the road quite slippery and difficult to walk on, and the fog was very thick. Even at a distance of thirty steps, it was difficult to see faces clearly. On the sidewalks, traces of people were few and far between. At that time, the reporter thought that the long-distance race would be canceled because of this, and the results would inevitably be affected. However, upon reaching Rue du Consulat, a crowd of people was already packed tightly. The grand scene was indeed not affected. As a result, the scores exceeded expectations, with the first, second, and third places all breaking the previous champion's record.</p>
<p>Sixty-One Participants, Forty-Six Started</p>
<p>A total of sixty-one people participated this time, but at the pre-race roll call, only forty-six actually arrived. Fifteen people were absent, presumably due to unforeseen circumstances that prevented them from participating, which is understandable. In the end, forty-two people reached the finish line. Only four people gave up halfway, either due to cramps or lack of strength. Nevertheless, this phenomenon is already commendable.</p>
<p>Deaf Person Lou Wen'ao Took the Lead from the Start</p>
<p>At precisely 8:00 AM, the starter Chen Yuze fired a silver pistol, and ninety-two swift feet took off together. They rose and fell, forming a long, serpentine line. The initial burst at the start was truly exciting to watch. People were jostling and pushing each other, making it impossible to tell who was in the lead. The reporter rode his bicycle back to the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Jing'an Temple, where the spectators were craning their necks to look into the distance. They saw Lou Wen'ao taking the lead, his legs moving like flying. He focused on pushing forward, and the spectators applauded, to which Lou responded with a slight smile. Following him were the veteran Wan Jinsheng, then the Japanese runners Manuyama Ichiro, Mabuchi Kichiji, and Sun Zhifang, vying for position, each unknown to the others. The procession surged forward, receiving applause from the spectators along the way.</p>
<p>Chasing the Runners Through the Fog, Observing Their Positions</p>
<p>Throughout the race, Lou Wen'ao never looked back. The deaf man ran like an old horse who knows the way, both fast and steady. By the time they reached Route Maréchal Joffre, the Japanese runner Manuyama Ichiro and Mabuchi Kichiji were full of ambition. Meanwhile, Qian Zhenxing was also closely following them, refusing to let go. On Route Tenant de la Tour, Lou Wen'ao was still far ahead, with the second-place runner more than three hundred meters behind. At this point, Mabuchi Kichiji seemed to be losing strength, while Wan Jinsheng was gaining momentum. Manuyama Ichiro and Sun Zhifang were fiercely competing for position. The Japanese runner Kanamura Norio was gritting his teeth in the crowd.</p>
<p>Counting Heads at the Finish Line: Deaf Person Shows Promise</p>
<p>The reporter took a shortcut to the finish line ahead of the runners, where there was already a large crowd, all watching to determine the final outcome. Before 9:00 AM, Lou Wen'ao straightened his chest, looked back to see that no one was in sight, and with one final burst of energy, set a new record, crossing the finish line in 57 minutes and 25 seconds. This broke the previous record of 59 minutes and 8 seconds set by the "Monkey King" Zheng Lin. In the heavy fog and slippery streets, it was truly a triumphant achievement. Wan Jinsheng finished four hundred meters behind him in 58 minutes and 23 seconds. The third-place finisher, Sun Zhifang, finished in 58 minutes and 45 seconds, making a great effort to catch up to the veteran Wan. The fourth place went to the Japanese runner Manuyama Ichiro in 59 minutes and 27 seconds. The fifth place went to Mabuchi Kichiji in 59 minutes and 45 seconds, about two hundred meters behind the previous runner. The sixth place went to Hara Hiroshi in 61 minutes and 43 seconds. The seventh place went to Qiu Xingqing in 61 minutes and 56 seconds. The eighth place went to Qian Zhenxing in 62 minutes and 24 seconds, who had nimble feet but couldn't keep up the speed. The ninth place went to Jiang Xin Xinwu, who finished in 63 minutes exactly, swaying as he ran. The last prize winner was Wang Zhiyi in 64 minutes and 53 seconds. The Japanese runner Kanamura Norio, realizing he had failed, reached the finish line in eleventh place, earning a commemorative medal but no prize as the first non-prize winner. After that, the remaining runners trickled across the finish line, totaling forty-two in all. The other four participants vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>After the race, Ma Moufang presented the awards, and in the midst of the cheers, the deaf person Lou Wen'ao could only smile and not speak. The reporter then hastily departed. (By Bi Mou)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Wrestling Competition: A Rare Spectacle in Shanghai; Tong Zhongyi's Archery is Divine <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The wrestling competition, jointly organized by the Zhongqing and Jingwu Sports Associations, was held at 7:30 PM on the 16th (last Thursday) in the gymnasium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. This type of competition is a first for Chinese participants. The reporter was invited by Mr. Liang Zhao'an, director of the Zhongqing Sports Association, and gladly attended as an observer. However, as an amateur in this field, the reporter did not dare to make any comments, but only recorded the grand occasion.</p>
<p>By 7:30 PM, the area in front of the gate was already packed with spectators, all eager to see this new and interesting event. The reporter's seat was particularly comfortable, offering a high and unobstructed view. There were over a thousand guests, making for an exceptionally lively atmosphere. There were very few female guests, which suggests that the sport has not yet deeply penetrated the general public. Considering this achievement, it can be recognized as a focal point for continued efforts to promote the sport in the future, which will certainly have a bright future.</p>
<p>In the wrestling competition, Jingwu defeated Zhongqing. It is said that Jingwu has a long history under the training of Tong Zhongyi, while Zhongqing's level is lower. Therefore, despite their best efforts to resist, they inevitably lost. It seems that Yang Moushou of Jingwu has deeply mastered the secrets of the sport, easily defeating She Youyang of Zhongqing, who did not show much strength.</p>
<p>Next was a martial arts performance, where real swords and spears were used, and the performers leaped and flew, dazzling the audience, who responded with thunderous applause.</p>
<p>After that was the "mud loach" wrestling. In this form of wrestling, the participants do not wear shirts, exposing their bodies to fight. Without clothing to grab onto for leverage, only those with true skill can perform well. Jingwu students demonstrated the technique, with those who were like contestants in a tournament came to the stage one by one. It demonstrated skills, also included comical antics, eliciting laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>Finally, Tong Zhongyi performed ancient archery. Tong's reputation has long preceded him, and admiring audience members were eager to see Tong perform. His arrows flew like shooting stars, with almost every shot hitting the target. He hit seven out of ten shots. It is said that under the bright lights, he could have hit nine out of ten shots. The entire audience cheered, and the grand event concluded.</p>
<p>It is believed that this competition and performance have significance in promoting national essence, and it is hoped that continued efforts will lead to greater achievements. (By the Thin Reporter)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Current Situation of Western Youth Basketball: Hualian Stands Alone; The Liu Family Team Lost to Dongfang; Monac Defeated by Tongren <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In Group A of the Western Youth Basketball League, only three teams, Hualian, Huanan, and Monac, maintained undefeated records last week. However, after the games played last Wednesday, only Hualian remained undefeated. Logically, in terms of strength, Hualian is the most dominant. However, there are still many strong opponents ahead, and Huanan and Dongfang both have formidable forces. They must be cautious and prudent in their approach to ensure smooth sailing, which is what the fans hope for. Strive to do your best, Hualian! A brief description of last week's games is listed below:</p>
<p>Huanan Triumphs on Monday Night</p>
<p>The first game was between Renyu and Dahua. The latter has been trained day and night by the elder Lu Zhen'en recently, and his basketball skills have been improving rapidly. The only shortcoming is that he cannot completely control his temper. Renyu, the veteran, still shows his prowess, but his shooting accuracy is lacking, so he only narrowly won by a score of 36-30. The second game was between Huanan and the Oil Team. Both teams are rising stars, and the game was extremely intense. Huanan ultimately prevailed due to their superior skills and endurance, defeating the up-and-coming Oil Team by a score of 37-29.</p>
<p>Hualian Plays Fiercely in Two Games on Wednesday</p>
<p>The first game was between Hualian, who defeated Giant last week, and the Three-Losses Team, which is full of old and weak players. The strength difference was significant. The Three-Losses Team was like a car that had derailed, while Hualian was like a sharp turn. Kong Guangyi and Qu Xijiong were like entering a no-man's land, while Mou Xuechong and Wu Chengzhang were comfortable and effective. They easily won by a score of 76-21, the most lopsided score in Group A this season. The second game was between the home team Giant and Amateur. Amateur was frustrated and unable to achieve their goals, partly due to the incompleteness of their lineup. Tao Shaosheng wanted to rally but could not find a way. Therefore, Amateur lost again by a score of 29-54, and Giant earned two points.</p>
<p>Both Strong Teams are Defeated in Friday's Games</p>
<p>That night, the atmosphere in the basketball hall was particularly intense. Both of the undefeated teams were defeated. Dongfang showed their prowess, and A Bao had a point. The Xuan Family Team fought bravely, and Xuan Jun showed his skills. The fans applauded thunderously. The Western Youth basketball hall has been particularly lively this year.</p>
<p>Since unfortunately losing to Tongren, Dongfang has learned from their mistakes. This time, they had the support of Gao Baosheng, Xu Wenkui, Wang Jinghu, Zhang Shaoxiang, and Bao Songyuan, the five tigers. Although Huanan's momentum was strong, their experience was lacking. A Kui and A Bao were able to do as they pleased, and Dongfang's future is looking brighter. Huanan suffered their first defeat, with a score of 41-27.</p>
<p>Tongren played with great spirit last week, capturing Dongfang and becoming a team that cannot be underestimated. Monac's record has not yet shown results, and with the planning of Giant's triumphant Milov from the sidelines, they are not an ordinary team. However, the Xuan Family Team lived up to the encouragement of the crowd, relying on Zhang Banglun's bravery and Xuan Jun's left-handed shooting to secure the victory by a score of 37-33, a narrow win.
