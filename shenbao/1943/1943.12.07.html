<h3 id="c1">大東亞戰爭與重慶政權 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>兩年以前，英美荷與重慶政權，盛倡ABCD聯合陣錢之說，重慶並以躋身於中引爲自豪。因此，估計日本決不會發動戰爭，且決不敢發動戰爭。他們的理由，當然是「在實力方面，聯合陣慶如何堅強，日本方面如何脆弱」。一套理論。這在英美一向以侵略手段對付東亞各民族，永遠以欺騙狡獪面具出現者，自吹自擂，商不足道，而重慶政權也信以爲眞，自鳴得意，估計日本完全錯誤，迨大東亞戰爭爆發，接着演變的事實，完全與英美的吹與擂相反，英美固然遭了當頭棒喝，重慶政權也受了一重大打擊。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的爆發，是由日本於客觀環境壓迫而不得不發動的，這裹，我們應該認識的，當時日本並不是孤注一擲的，對於敵人的力量是作過準確估計的。所以，在爆發以後，不旋踵間，各地速捷，英美勢力，迅速崩潰。於是，所謂ABCD聯合陣綫，頓時銷聲匿跡，僅成話柄而已。在此情勢下，英美荷本身固然因爲實力有所未逮，無法取勝·而重慶方面，旣已目擊ABCD陣綫之泡影消減，仍不覺悟過去估計之錯誤。更以爲英美遭受痛擊，必定以太平洋爲第」主義，集中全力以圖反攻，而給日本以致命打擊。重慶存此奢望，尤其對美作種種宣傳鼓吹。可是，事實勝於雄辯，日本在大東亞戰爭中，業已建立確定勝利的基礎，而且英國有其在歐洲本身的危機，商窮於應付呢？所以，重慶政權在大東亞戰爭爆發以後，對於英美以太平洋爲第一主義的奢望，又落了空，也就是第二次的打擊。</p>
<p>自從上次羅斯福，邱吉爾在奎貝克會談以後，美國似乎發動了南太平洋的反攻。當然，在這一次會談中，重慶方面也會竭力撒嬌，可是，美國反攻的決定，與其說是受重慶方面的慫恿，倒不如說是爲了自身侵略野心的未戢，來得準確。</p>
<p>但是，美國在南太平洋的反攻，又是屢戰屢敗，最近日本海軍在波根維爾島的大捷，足以與奇襲珍灣先復媲美。所以，敵美的反攻，縱是重慶方面所十分企求的，而當前的事實，又是以反攻的敗北答覆重慶的企求，這是又一個打擊。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭兩年中，所予重慶政權的打擊是如此，而重慶政權還是執拗，還是死心塌地依存於英美，這是中國統一前途的不幸。</p>
<p>今天我們要坦白的說一句，在大東亞戰爭的當初與兩年後的現在，日本對中國的關係以至對東亞的關係，是有很大的轉變的，這一種事實，我們必須認淸接受的。</p>
<p>重慶政權依賴英美，決不能指望其參加大東亞戰爭，而中國必須統一建設，決不能容許重慶政權之分裂負嵎，那末，和平區內如何修明政治，安定民生，强化政治地位，俾全國人民一致傾向，這一重大責任，完全在於南京國民政府了。</p>

<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電　菲總統洛勒爾以大東亞戰爭二周年紀念日即屆，特發表談話要者如次：亞洲乃我人之母體，昔曾長時期處於四歐勢力之侵略下，但今終於自沉睡中覺醒。蓋四歐各國之侵略亞非二洲、乃自哥倫布·麥哲倫等發現者爲始，而菲律賓乃自四班牙移屬於美國之支配下，惟自日俄戰爭日本獲勝後、亞洲民族乃逐漸覺醒，歐洲人之優越感，途失其神秘性，而產生「亞洲人之亞洲」之新原則。西歐各勢力，自日本戰勝俄國後，深感與東亞各國尤其與日本提携·致擴張帝國主義之舉，已大爲困雖。惟英美兩國則竟仍以其所謂扶助弱小國家經濟與文化發展之欺騙手段，而於東亞從事據展展其勢力，日本久已洞悉英美之企圖，但始終保守沉默，埋首强化國內經濟政治及軍事上之實力，並爲確保必要原料品起見，乃更排除英美一切之阻撓，而與東亞各國確立通商關係。不幸日本多年之努刀，未得所償，即發生中日事變、英美遂　此機會，對渝作軍事上政治上等等之援助、美國更變本加厲，對日禁止輸出破鐵石油並凍結資金，竟採取經濟封鎖手段，繼更自各方面加重對日之壓迫、日本爲束亞各民族之和平計，乃於一九四一年派遣野村及來栖兩大使赴美·　圖事態好轉，但美國則亳無誠意，日本乃毅然奮起致力建設大東亞共榮圈，而大東亞戰爭甫起，日本將東亞英美之勢力完全粉碎，舉世爲之　驚。自是東亞民族亦皆自覺，毋須再借助西歐各國之支援，自應　起以建設東亞民族共存共榮之樂土。吾人見緬甸菲律賓獨立，中華民國之接收租界，泰國之恢復失地，自由印度臨時政府之樹立，以及馬來東印度各地民衆之參與政治等事，卽知共榮圈之建設，已逐漸實現，尤以前此在大東亞會議中通過之大東亞共同宣言，誠乃人類史上最大之憲章，同時亦可謂爲束亞十億民衆擁護其算器利益而防止外力侵入之宣言。又宣言中共存共榮。獨立親和·繁榮經濟·　揚文化·貢獻世界發展之五大原則，更洵屬構成東亞共榮圈無上之理想一，以及健全之道義性與正義本質之母體。今者大東亞民族巳達至大困苦與艱難之局面，且此種苦况相當深刻，但吾人為自身之將業，絕不惜作一世之犧牲·同時更以堅　之決心，與日本緊密協力，繼續向達成大東亞安　之　邁進。吾等大亞洲民族完成此最後之目的，始能確保東亞民族之幸福，而有以貢獻人類之福祉。當此大東亞戰爭已屆二周年之　吾人試回顧過去由努力所得之收獲，則確信大束亞十億民衆之團結將日益緊密，而對大東亞將來之確信，亦有堅固云云。</p>

<p>南京六日巾央社電　日駐華大使館岸情報部長，以大東亞戰爭二　年紀念將屆、特於六日下午七時起、在中央廣播電台，以「必勝之信念」爲題，而對旅華六十萬日僑發　廣播、力予應以平等互惠之精神，實踐中日同盟條約。並以必勝之信念，努力大東亞建設。詞意精　　　，爰誌其大意如次：</p>
<p>「本月八日，爲大東亞戰爭二週年紀念，於迎此可紀念日，余特與僑華諸君，就吾人對此日本有史以來之重大時期，略述感想如次：吾人何故以英美爲對手、　然執戈而起？　大東亞戰爭爲日本與盎格魯撤克遜民放之鬥爭、換言之，亦可謂爲日美戰爭。日本及東亞民族與英美而戰之目的，不僅將英美驅出東亞，且欲以自身力　·建設新東亞。中國於本年一月，對英美兩國佈告宣戰。在十月卅日、中日又締結同盟條約，確立兩國友好關係，永久不變、且非同担負建設東亞之重任，於是東亞民族集中排力、對英美之戰鬥體制、業已闡明中外。</p>
<p>大東亞會議，乃爲束亞各民族携手驅逐英美侵略之會議，開戰以來，日軍迭獲奇助，英美現仍圖反攻，以至在南海各島間展開劇戰。然大東亞建設工作，逐步進展，大束亞民族團結態勢、亦日趨鞏固。英美對此事實極感威脅、故英美除軍事上反攻以外，並展開政治攻勢。乃謀略宣傳，且謀離間東亞各民族及軸心各國。英美在魁北克會談以後，又舉行英美蘇三國會談，最近羅邱蔣會議後，福斯福，邱吉爾，又與史丹林在伊期會談。然彼等共同戰爭目的，並不一致，互相利害關係，尤有衝突。在此種同床異夢之情形下，始終不能表明，如大東亞宣言之堂皇的政策。彼等雖屢次宣傳，所謂「日本無條件投降」等夢語，因此次與大東亞會議似相呼應、而展開之第六次玻根維爾島海面空戰，日軍所獲之赫赫戰果、又吉爾貝特島三四次大戰果，及昨日馬紹爾羣島之戰果，敵艦船被炸沉毀者實達一百二十艘之多。僅航空母艦，亦達二十艘、敵機被學毀者計九百架以上，此誠所謂空前絕後之大勝利。</p>
<p>又前綫日軍將士等一億國民，精神一體，均抱戰事必勝之信念與決意。僅此之大戰果，敵方將如何雄辯，亦不能掩飾。今後敵軍反攻，勢必愈趨劇烈，我人必須覺悟，將在各方面展開壯烈之戰鬥。我人需時刻不忘，不擊滅敵人不止之信念。尤其吾人生活於中國國民之間、應時常自覺，且需親身實踐，中日同盟條約中之平等互惠精神等。應時刻具有必勝之信念，與建設之熱意。吾人深信必勝之信念堅決後，則完遂大東亞戰爭，及中日兩國民對建設大束亞秩序之提携、自能實現也。」</p>

<p>— 野村吉三郞</p>
<p>一線希望也落空了</p>
<p>羅斯福總統，赫爾國務卿，懷着上面的成見而從事日美交涉，在現在看來是無疑的了。此徵之於先前美國國務院所公佈的文件也可以明瞭。亞洲人的亞洲，或大束亞新秩序的理念，他們不會理解，也不想理解。把這種人作爲對手，交涉是否能有所妥協呢？率直地說來，我實以為這是困難的問題。那麼，我何以到美國去呢？說到我自己，我既亳無成算，而接受這重大的使命，上對皇帝，下對國民司在大華大戲院招待參戰影片。，從說不出的心境出發，幾經躊躇，以決行止。那裏有幾個理由，但現在我所能說的，祇有下面一事。因有此一事，我乃不量力，敢於担任駐美大使的重任，以當日美交涉的難局。雖然那或許祗是一綫希望，或不過是一道微細的光。</p>
<p>這裏我們有回願前次大戰時的太平洋情勢，尤其是以石井，藍辛協定為中心時的日美關係之必要。那時美國合衆國抱着侵略世界的野心，對東方，對西方，用目空一世，傍若無人的態度，企圖強行其政策。但指導者的意志和國民的感情之間的距離，不容有足以實現那野心的充分軍備，即在現在亦然。所以前次的第一次大戰時，日本的對華政策，和美國的遠東政策之間，各種困難的問題堆如山積，結果都一一獲得暫時妥協，和日本締結石井藍辛協定。有這種過去的歷史。之後軍備雖見積極充實，野心也隨之增加，但這中間的情形，似乎並沒有本質上的變化。</p>
<p>如其起了這種變化，那無異是美國自殺的行爲。因此緣故，他們無論怎樣誇口，因後面沒有實力做背景，所以還有討價還價的餘地，而打聞日美關係，也未必絕望。</p>
<p>事態終於惡化</p>
<p>自己是海軍出身。担任這任務，非熟悉石井藍辛協定，及其他太平洋和日美問的情形不可。我常想，這或許不是我所擅長的。從國民之間也往往聽見關於日美交涉的種種意見·但一旦接受之後，本應勞力不使戰爭發生的，然而我無能，戰爭終於發生，那又何以自解？我沒有盡責。然而卞個月來，躊躇思維，隱忍自重，心力交瘁，從事折衝。回日本後，聽到種種，我的想法又從這裏前進一步。實施了所有國家與國家的問題上所應施的一切手段，講求了一切所應請求的方策，以至於想盡千方百計，如不到對外戰爭的地步，眞正的國民一致團結，是難有希望的。我們充分體會日本政府的方針，在交涉的路途上，我們所見到的可行之道，無不都巳經走到了。鞠躬盡瘁，直至最後的一日。</p>
<p>然而十一月二十六日，終於走到最惡的事態，收到最後的覺書。此前，交涉落空的狀態，一度發出希望之光。過八月中句，近衛首相以兩首腦者會談的公報遞交羅斯福，那時，羅斯福爲這公報的內容非常感動。羅斯福本來是非常喜歡這種戲劇性的人。他一時也非常高興。</p>
<p>但適用獨自的方式長期間研究日本和遠東政策的國務院—中國事變以來、曾寫了二百幾十封對日抗議書的國務院—似乎並不知道這情形，後來和我希望相容來栖大使飛美應援時，這會談的結束機會、報紙上民載的不過十分之一。聽國務院負責者向新聞記者所談的話，也公然是絕望口氣的演說。所以十一月二十六日的提案，日本雖不知道，他們自然知道得很詳細了。</p>
<p>此後，據對方當局老所言，在此前後，海軍長官向前方的陸海軍發出準備戰爭的警告。又最近國務院發表的文件中：「一月二十九日，國飭卿會見駐美英大使，告以日美問的外交方面已告終了，此問題現由陸海軍處理」。美國方面積極整頓戰爭的準備，以等候十二月八日的到來，這是許多人所說的，我也順便提起。</p>
<p>如是，羅斯福政府把美國國民朦在鼓裏，投八戰爭的漩渦。如羅斯福和赫爾自己所說，他們比美國國民看到十年後的事、一步一步把國民的悄緖牽引到自己的　抱來。拖着議會的尾巴拚命擴充軍　。和平的美國，充滿着戰爭的空氣。挑撥世界，美國國民漸漸被拖到那裏，終於走進戰爭，而蔓延到所羅門和阿留申的邊涯。那戰爭的規模之大，遠此前次的大戰所能比較。羅斯福所說的絕對勝利，無條件投降等無禮的放肆話，和威爾遜所提倡的十四條宣言、或使戰後不發生復仇戰爭的理念，美國國民看到這二者之問的巨大的相差，作何感想？在這二個大總統的統治下，我適二次駐在華盛頓，把前次和後次一併囘想起來了，不勝感　。羅斯福政權所企圖的如上述侵略世界政策，美國國民能夠完全理解而發生共鳴嗎？且絕對勝利，無條件投降等大膽的、滑稽的話、從普通的常識看來，乃是不正當的目的，相信能夠用美國的力量實現嗎？日本能容　嗎？這些祇有讓美國人諸君判斷。</p>
<p>太平洋的作戰目標</p>
<p>日本國民一般地所想的，乃現在的戰爭，在離開日本本土非常　的地方進行。無論是空襲也好。潛水艦也好，總之這戰爭遠離日本內地二千哩以上的遠方，這想法牢不可破。這是非常大的錯誤。祇要一看現在日本戰略上的地位，立刻就可以明瞭，日本的中心，日本的心　、決不僅是日本內地。日木內地固然有重要的地方，同時，在東亞共榮圈的遠方，也有幾處是日本所視爲最需要的。</p>
<p>敵人知道得很詳細。現在尙担任美國某要職的某某等說：「野村君，日本似乎要和美國戰爭。但石油不是先就沒有嗎？日本祗從美國買了這一點點石油。」他舉出令人不信的數字，向奔走於打開日美交涉的我，發出這種議論。當然，我不是那種議論的對手，但仔細研究日本所視爲痛苦的地方，就一點也沒有輕蔑之而稱快的心境。此時日本的心　，在雨方，在大東亞共榮圈各地，這些地方和日本內地有同樣的重嬰性，而敵方想以之從日本本土切　。我希望和國民諸君一同牢記。英美在太平洋的作戰目標，完全在此。</p>
<p>英美在以前就是以封鎖戰術爲主要戰略的國家。世界各强國所實施的戰爭方法，不用說、均爲就共國家的國悄而發，爲那國家的傳統上最得意的武器、所以不能大意。封鎖戰術者，封鎖敵人，自己則自由地制　海上·其根本精神，一面獲得自已所必要的物資、一面使敵方不能獲得其所必要的物資·從這一點說、美國以前曾主張海上自由之說，漸漸的建造大海軍，不久變成五，五，之比率，這還不夠，繼又計劃加倍的大海軍，稱兩洋艦隊。</p>
<p>這一個企圖欲同時制壓太平洋和大西洋的企　，顯然想用制海來制　世界的想法·這最後就要說到海軍。自己的力量不足時，則主張海上自由，現在則想使花旗在海上自由地週航。海軍條約失效之後的美國海軍政策，以此點為中心而行動，昭然若揭。諧克斯等人每有機會就揚言海上自由，亳無忌憚。抑制世界的海面，壟斷世界的物資，不制覇世界不止，美國帝國主義的大野心，就在於此。</p>
<p>根本戰略是封鎖策</p>
<p>我到華盛頓就任後，切身感到美國海軍政　之急激的變動，而不能不爲美國國民悚然而懼。前次大戰時威爾　任總統，我在華盛頓任海軍武官，威爾遜也竭力主張干涉政策，但和羅斯福比起來，在規模上，有天地之隨。天惠與豐富的物資，住於美洲大陸的美國人，爲何要在大山和密林的土地上，珊瑚礁和　　的深海中，遠至所羅門，新幾內亞的天涯海角，埋葬自由的美國巿民之權利與生命呢？囘答　有一個，那就是最熱中於最近大軍計劃的維斯福總統之世界政策的野心他。們現在對日本企圖的戰爭目的，當然以上述之點為主眼·所以為攪亂人心而進行神經戰，或許的游擊行動，作爲戰爭的手段之一，但根本還是以封鎖戰為重心，切斷南方和日本本士的聯終，妨碍其必要物資的供給，使日本不能遂行戰爭。從笑國的傳統及最近的海軍膨脹政策看來，現在對日所取的戰略，封鎖戰不但是最多可能性，而且是根本的戰略。</p>
<p>總之，我們應認識日本的心　在日本內地，同時也在共榮圈的遠方。日本的自存自榮，有待於共榮圈的自存自榮，然後方能貫澈。麥克沃塞拚死欲　囘拉蒲爾，蒙特巴頓從印度洋方面虎視耽耽，我們不能不知道，這東西的兩支敵方海上勢力，正在伺隙以待。從這意義上看來，東亞共同宣言的五大原則，實極重大，且彪炳如日月。</p>
<p>共存共榮，尊重獨立，昻揚文化，經濟互惠，徹廢人種的差別，對全世界開放資源—這些，乃世界各國多年來所共具的理念且希望其實現的東西。因被各民族的利已主義所妨害，迄今日止猶不能實行。現在束亞諸民族，跑在歐美列强的前面，而將實現，這在歷史上，國際上，以至於人道上，實是件大事，而日本的戰爭目標，也誠大大之至。</p>
<p>美國國民現在不能不虛心傾聽這東亞諸民族的共同宣言。諸君虛心坦　地閱　這大宣言的精神時，對於目前把數萬同胞的生靈投入所羅門海、新幾內亞密林中的慘酷現實、諸君將如何解釋呢。（轉入第四版）</p>

<p>棉花統制委員會之統買統配工作，現已按照旣定計劃在積極推行之中，而其目下考慮之焦點，則在於　棉花收買價格之確定　收買資金之籌集與運用，　各棉產區中心地域公庫之設立。茲就以上所述三點，分別加以硏究，再爲檢討如下：關於棉花收買的價格，正如其他農產物相同、限價不可過低，致使農氏失望，其結果非但農民不願以已收獲之棉花輕易出售，甚且可將未種植之棉田改種共他農作物，如雜糧之類，其影輕於將來之棉花生產，殊爲重大，故收買價格，必須衡情予以提高。關於收買資金之籌集，若僅由收買商自行辦理，恐在籌集與運用方面·都不能達於理想的境界，應由當局助成或融資，有如華北農業增產計劃中，對棉花增產由棉業振興會依棉花單位面積之增收實行融資辦法，所以在華中方面，應由棉統會當局予以協力·並由國家銀行貸給之。關於稀產公庫之設立，聞地點不止南通上海兩處，而係普及於其他產棉區域，自爲合理的辦法；此外，在儲藏方面，必須注重公庫的設備，藉防水火之危險。</p>
<p>至在統配方面，聞當以配給各工廠製造爲前題，而其具體辦法，則正在擬可中。如今，紗布價格核定以後，即可實施配給，同時，商統會發表棉布自由買　並不恢復，那末，棉布配給數量，就得要有合理的增加，庶幾民衆不至衣不能暖。可是，充分的配給，有賴於充分的生產；爲推進紗布之生產，即不能不以棉花儘量供給於各工廠。以從事於棉布之製造。這是製造棉布之工廠所企望的，尤其是受棉布配給之民衆所企望的。</p>

<p>孤立主義者的存在</p>
<p>但除非把敝人的武力擊至最從的最從，絕對有結束這戰爭的第二條路。連根剷除了敵的海上勢力以後，最初的覺　美國人眼睛的機會、方才到來。現在所羅門所獲龐大戰果的累積將使美國日益困難，不久達到決定戰局的轉機。縱使美國國內暴　種種的弱點，那不過刺　並誘發戰局的韓機而漸趨嚴重化，共武力仍堅實如故，戰局在遲緩進行之際，任何弱點，不能對之有過大的期待。</p>
<p>現在美國的做法，美國人稱之爲干涉主義，孤立主義也好，干涉主義也好，其內容跟着時代而略有變遷，但如今孤立主義的人們在美國大約仍存在着。即在有力的政治家之中也有這種孤立主義者。他們爲數雖少，但在開戰之　，相當有勢力、開戰後，孤立主義被稱　北主義，故滑蹤滅跡，但孤立主義的存在，却是儼然的事實。</p>
<p>不過這裏須特別注意者，這孤立主義者，在太平洋最近的形勢上，凡有關於日水者，主張　極論。美國的動向、　來特別重視太平洋，就使孤立派，對此方面也打破了以前的沉默，　着政府當局、裝着積極論者·發言强硬，這事實我們也是不能看過的。孤立主義者如其有了作爲反對派的力量，則現在的政府在失敗上再加上一重失敗，那就是日本的武力突刺敵人心　的時　。</p>
<p>弱點—人種與罷工</p>
<p>美國的第二個弱點是人種問題。例如德國系的美國人，雖各人的統計不同，約有五六百萬，義國系美人四五百萬，愛兩關系美人亦約略同數，此外，南歐北歐的移民也非常多。黑人達一千二二三百萬。以盎格魯撤克遜人爲中樞，這各種人種，在美國第一這點上，也是一致的，但戰局不利，戰爭長期，而這人種問題和其他社會問題結合起來的塲合，又如何呢？和日本比較起來，那是怎樣大的，怎樣重要的美國的弱點呢？</p>
<p>說到最近頗見激化的罷工問題，我的看法是這樣的。那糾紛的裏面，大約有種種政治的，思想的策動—但支配那主流的現在還是經濟的原因。說到叛逆國家秩序，似乎還不致於此。以　的亳無所知現在大約是這樣　！要之物價漸漸地在高漲，據說一個月約上漲百分之一，這二年間，　漲了百分之二十五。一方面，政府恐懼通貨膨脹，雖實施固定工資，固定價格等方法，　賦稅日高，所以物價也不能抑制。固定工資事實上也成　不可能。因物資不足，生活亦愈困苦。這是罷工迭起的主因。美國勞働運動的組織非常强大，甚至於有人說是羅斯福政權的一大敵國，跟着戰爭的進展，因工業的需要孔亟，糾紛的激化，而愈擴大其勢力。又罷工事件據最近的情報·常致出動軍隊以鎭壓。所以先前說這成爲美國國內的重大問題，乃是當然的。但雖然那樣，抛開了我們武力的成功，而致過份的期待，　不能不嚴爲愼重。</p>
<p>被輿論束縛的國家</p>
<p>美國是所謂與論的國家的確如此。雖然是總統如遇前述使國民吃驚的事情，也不絕地費盡心思，以換縱奧論，指導輿論。其反面。就因此故，此次終於成爲自已所製造的與論之俘　。常須顧到與論，常被輿論所束縛。會見總統，會見國務　，隨時我感覺到如此。所謂　重民意也與此不同，他們的頭腦不復能離開輿論，不能從這裏走出一步。</p>
<p>那日美交涉無論如何不能有希望了。報紙上說交涉可以結束的機會，十不得一。美國的與論到此地步，雖令總統在會談中途被日本方面的意見所打動，總統也毫無辦法。羅斯福本身或許以爲戰爭不可避而一定要這樣，但我想說，不然。他無論如何不能自據於輿論。不是從與論中，而是從典論的更高一層的地方眺望輿論、於是不能仔細考慮日美百年的大計·這就是美國政治家所負的宿命的性格。我經十個月的會談·會想，他為何不能前進一步，然百思不得其解。</p>
<p>戰爭前途多難</p>
<p>總之、這是與論之國—美國的與論之有力活動的一面。一方面說戰局順利進行中，一面把國民驅使至所羅門，新幾內亞，而屢戰　北，這拆穿了美的戰爭目的的大話，但這輿論不知道。這或許就是前述美國的弱點即浸透於這輿論而卒至支配一切。美國的指導者恐懼與論比一切爲甚。即使積貯了多麼强大的軍備·　道道軍備就用以遠涉重洋，作侵略世界般無理的戰爭，至戰爭不利，獨强辯爲自存自衛、而把國民拖累到最後囑？到此地　，美國何以還在國民眼前掩飾敗績的眞相，形勢雖趨不利。猶不能不片而强行拖延下去。大概美國人是喜歡睹博，即投機的危險之國民。來年就是總統選舉、各地選舉的結果，對民主黨不利。迎着這一個政治　節、無論怎樣不能不使國民的同意傾向這方面。接一連二的把大艦隊開向所羅門方面，美國的戰意，誠極可怖，又其戰略亦是極富於能動性的。起使遇到荏弱的敵人，不錯，會獲得大成功。但對像日本那樣的强敵，來得正好，正中我們的下懷。</p>
<p>已造成勝利的端倪了　對於這些戰果，日本國民旣不因驕而怠，敵方美國恐也不會因此而懼。前遂日趨嚴重，曲折行餘，尙在於今後。（全文完）（翔：　自十一月十九日至二十一日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3 id="c53">關於劉海粟的油畫 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>近代藝術從印象主義掀起了色彩的革命，終於又在眩耀耀平凡之中埋沒了它的前程，代之而崛起於世界畫壇者，那應該是主張表現自我與內在眞實的大藝術家塞尙（Cezanne）了。</p>
<p>他否定了客觀的再現和瞬間印象的把捉，追求着藝術的永恒性、二十世紀世界畫壇的燦　光明，實在是應該歸功於這位新興藝術之父塞尙的。</p>
<p>有縱橫浩蕩的天才的海粟先生，在油畫上的努力，自然是走着塞尙所走的道路的，換句話說：他是從　尙的寫實性出發、表現出自己崇高偉大的性格，堅强不屈的人格，「盧森堡之雪」，「鷄冠花」，「靈隱寺」諸幅，可以作爲這一方面明徹的解釋。蓋共作法嚴　，且充滿色彩之狂熱與尊崇也。</p>
<p>海粟先生也有如火如荼的熱情，所以他也是喜歡高（Van　Gogh）一般的用金黃，朱紅，羣　，天藍等的色彩像「快車」「紫　球花」「烟嵐」等就有這樣的感覺，但梵高在狂熱强烈之中似乎有悲慘的叫喊，有可怕的命運滑藏着，而他原只是富麗輝煌的。</p>
<p>我們又不得不注意的，海粟先生對於祖國上代藝術不斷的探索而又走着中國新藝術創造的途徑，這似乎要在他的國畫作品之上更覺感受得到的，可是「巴巴達仰火山」的宏偉，「鳳尾樹」與「水牛」的　勁，「白馬」與「佛塔」的堅實，「殘荷」與「鵜」的高簡，這不是指出了油畫的新風格？是中外古今文化融洽之後的創造，也正是海粟先生藝術上的獨特的創造。</p>
<p>本來美術所以爲美術的本質，不在模寫的對象，却在能創造自我的內部，所以愈是純粹的藝術便愈能表現這樣自內的精神。</p>

<p>— 陸生</p>
<p>肺病是呼吸系統疾患，呼吸系統日與外界不斷接觸、最易着而爲病。所以內經謂肺爲嬌　，不耐邪侵，蓋即狀此。如在病期中，或由療養生活而至於社會活動、在過程上言之、實屬一絕大的轉變，在從業上說，大家都知道以從事園藝或農林業等之野外工作爲最適宜。但際此人　於食之秋，一職之獲得，良非易易。欲得業如理想之如意者，能有幾希？須知肺病與職業之關係，乃屬相對而非絕對，且如肺病之獲愈、由於　陰以治本者，則人之本元已復，氣血已充，巳非　日之舊觀。故擇業之道，自可從寬。</p>
<p>此外，在上海更有一惡習，即遲睡是也。此種不良習慣、在鄉間則絕少發現的雖然半由於上海工商界職業上之關係。然因非必要的原因而不早眠者，亦復不少。須知睡眠乃最澈底的安　，人生終日勞形，端賴睡眠以復其精神。虛　由於本元不足而陰虛，酣睡最能復其所耗、晚上用熱水　足、能使血脈調和，而促其酣眠。</p>
<p>肺病治本之道，端在養陰補肺。此外如吸入治療法、能使藥力直達肺　，尤有捷功。惟此非經醫生診察不可。如欲求自療而得補肺之功，則中藥店有現成膏滋藥，名曰瓊玉膏。乃用黨參，生地，茯苓，白密熬　。可於每日早晚各服一次，每次服一二調匙，亦有補養之功。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Greater East Asia War and the Chongqing Regime <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Chongqing regime vigorously promoted the so-called ABCD united front, with Chongqing taking pride in joining it. Consequently, they estimated that Japan would not, and dared not, launch a war. Their reasoning, of course, was "how strong the united front is in terms of strength, and how weak Japan is." This was their theory. It is not worth discussing the self-praise of Britain and the United States, who have always used aggression to deal with the various ethnic groups in East Asia and always appear with a deceptive and cunning mask. However, the Chongqing regime also believed it to be true, was complacent, and completely miscalculated Japan's intentions. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the ensuing facts were completely contrary to what Britain and the United States boasted about. Britain and the United States were caught off guard, and the Chongqing regime also suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was caused by Japan's objective environmental pressure, which forced it to launch the war. Here, we should recognize that Japan was not betting everything on one throw at the time, and had made an accurate assessment of the enemy's strength. Therefore, after the outbreak, in no time at all, the British and American forces collapsed rapidly everywhere. As a result, the so-called ABCD united front suddenly disappeared and became just a laughing stock. Under this situation, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands themselves could not win because their strength was insufficient, and the Chongqing side, having witnessed the bubble of the ABCD front disappear, still did not realize the error of their past estimations. They further believed that Britain and the United States, having suffered a severe blow, would definitely prioritize the Pacific as their primary focus, concentrate their efforts to counterattack, and inflict a fatal blow on Japan. Chongqing harbored this extravagant hope, especially making various propaganda appeals to the United States. However, facts speak louder than words. Japan has already established a solid foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and Britain has its own crisis in Europe to cope with. So, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime's extravagant hope that Britain and the United States would prioritize the Pacific again fell through, which was the second blow.</p>
<p>Since the last meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec, the United States seems to have launched a counterattack in the South Pacific. Of course, during this meeting, the Chongqing side would have tried its best to act coquettishly, but the decision of the United States to counterattack was more accurately attributed to its own unchecked ambition for aggression than to the encouragement of the Chongqing side.</p>
<p>However, the American counterattack in the South Pacific has been repeatedly defeated. The recent great victory of the Japanese Navy at Bougainville Island is comparable to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Therefore, even though the enemy American counterattack is what the Chongqing side desperately seeks, the current reality is that the failure of the counterattack answers Chongqing's request, which is another blow.</p>
<p>The blows that the Chongqing regime has received in the two years of the Greater East Asia War are such, but the Chongqing regime is still stubborn and still wholeheartedly depends on Britain and the United States, which is the misfortune of China's future unification.</p>
<p>Today, we want to frankly say that at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and now, two years later, Japan's relationship with China and even with East Asia has undergone great changes. We must recognize and accept this fact.</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime relies on Britain and the United States and cannot be expected to participate in the Greater East Asia War. China must be unified and built, and the Chongqing regime's division and resistance cannot be tolerated. Then, how to improve politics, stabilize people's livelihood, and strengthen the political position in the peace zone, so that the people of the whole country unanimously incline towards it, this important responsibility completely lies with the National Government in Nanjing.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft bombed the city of Calcutta on the 5th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Calcutta: Japanese aircraft used to bomb Calcutta at night, and this is the first time they have attacked during the day, causing slight casualties to the citizens.</p>
<p>Twelve Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Fierce Air Battle</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - In order to counterattack Burma, the British army is making every effort to strengthen the British Indian army, and at the same time, it is increasing the supply of materials. Therefore, hundreds of people in the city of Calcutta are starving to death every day. However, the British side refuses the Japanese proposal to transport rice from Burma to India and is doing its best to defend the city and seize the opportunity to attack Burma. In order to crush the enemy's ambition, the Japanese army and navy air squadrons launched a surprise attack on the city of Calcutta on the 5th and engaged in a fierce air battle with the enemy's Spitfire, Hurricane, P51, and other fighter planes. Under the close cooperation of the Japanese army and navy aircraft, they eliminated the enemy's resistance and immediately shot down twelve enemy aircraft. They also fiercely bombed the enemy fleet and warehouses on the docks in the port of Calcutta. Two large enemy transport ships were severely damaged, and many dock facilities and warehouses were bombed and caught fire, resulting in great victories. In this battle, the Japanese side only sacrificed two aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War - Philippine President's Remarks - Hopes that All Ethnic Groups Will Cooperate to Achieve the Goal <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel issued a statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the main points of which are as follows: Asia is our motherland, and it was under the aggression of the Four European powers for a long time, but now it has finally awakened from its slumber. The aggression of the Four European countries against Asia and Africa began with the discoveries of Columbus and Magellan, and the Philippines was transferred from Spanish to American rule. However, after Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the Asian nations gradually awoke, and the sense of superiority of Europeans lost its mystery, giving rise to the new principle of "Asia for Asians." The Western European powers, after Japan's victory over Russia, deeply felt that their expansion of imperialism was greatly hampered by cooperation with East Asian countries, especially with Japan. However, Britain and the United States still engaged in expanding their influence in East Asia by using the deceptive means of so-called assisting the economic and cultural development of weak countries. Japan has long seen through the intentions of Britain and the United States, but has always remained silent, focusing on strengthening its domestic economic, political, and military strength. In order to secure the necessary raw materials, it further eliminated all obstacles from Britain and the United States and established trade relations with various East Asian countries. Unfortunately, Japan's efforts for many years were not rewarded, and the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. Britain and the United States then seized this opportunity to provide military, political, and other assistance to Chongqing. The United States further intensified its efforts, banning the export of scrap iron and oil to Japan and freezing its funds, and even adopted economic blockade measures. Subsequently, it increased its pressure on Japan from all aspects. For the sake of peace among the various ethnic groups in East Asia, Japan sent ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu to the United States in 1941 in an attempt to improve the situation. However, the United States showed no sincerity, and Japan resolutely rose up and devoted itself to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As soon as the Greater East Asia War began, Japan completely crushed the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia, astonishing the world. Since then, the East Asian nations have also become aware that they no longer need to rely on the support of the Western European countries and should rise up to build a paradise of coexistence and co-prosperity for the East Asian nations. We see the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the recovery of concessions by the Republic of China, the restoration of lost territories by Thailand, the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the participation of the people of Malaya and the East Indies in politics, etc., and know that the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is gradually being realized. Especially the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed at the Greater East Asia Conference is truly the greatest charter in human history. At the same time, it can also be said to be a declaration by one billion people in East Asia to protect their vested interests and prevent foreign invasion. Moreover, the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, economic prosperity, cultural advancement, and contribution to the world's development in the declaration are truly the supreme ideals that constitute the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the mother of a sound ethical and just nature. Today, the Greater East Asian nations have reached a situation of great difficulty and hardship, and this hardship is quite profound, but for the sake of our own future, we will not hesitate to make a lifetime sacrifice. At the same time, with firm determination, we will work closely with Japan to continue to move towards the achievement of peace in Greater East Asia. Only when we, the great Asian nations, have achieved this final goal can we ensure the happiness of the East Asian nations and contribute to the well-being of mankind. As the Greater East Asia War reaches its second anniversary, when we look back on the gains we have made through our efforts, we are convinced that the unity of the one billion people in Greater East Asia will become closer and closer, and our belief in the future of Greater East Asia will also be strengthened.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Based on the Traditional Spirit of the Two Countries, the Relationship Between Japan and Vietnam is Becoming Increasingly Good <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux issued a statement entitled "Message for the Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War," which reads as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnam's position has changed accordingly. Vietnam is inextricably linked to the East Asia War, especially its relationship with Japan. Based on various agreements, Vietnam and Japan have united as one, so there is no need to worry about changes in relations with the belligerent countries. The economic, cultural, and other harmonious system established in Asia is fully in line with the laws of freedom and is adapted to the development of the general situation in the world. Therefore, I am convinced that this harmonious system will be able to overcome the war and achieve prosperity. To this end, the general economy of Vietnam has undergone fundamental reforms. In order to fulfill its mission in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Vietnam had long ago deemed it necessary to take new measures. The efforts of the past two years have been to accomplish this mission. As a result, Vietnam's economy has been stabilized, the treaties have been fulfilled, and security has been ensured. It is generally believed that the achievements of the Vietnamese authorities in completing their tasks and the smooth progress of Japan-Vietnam joint defense, etc., are due to the sympathy and the spirit of deep understanding shown by the Japanese authorities, and we are extremely pleased with this. I am convinced that the close relationship between Japan and Vietnam, the cooperation between the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities, and the cultural and commercial relations between Japan and Vietnam will become increasingly good in the future, based on friendship and in accordance with the traditions of both sides.</p>

<h3 id="e12">On the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Information Department Chief Kishi Broadcasts - Striving to Build East Asia with a Belief in Certain Victory <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the upcoming second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese Embassy in China Information Department Chief Kishi will broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 6th on the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Belief in Certain Victory," to the 600,000 Japanese expatriates in China, urging them to implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and to strive for the construction of Greater East Asia with a belief in certain victory. His words were concise and meaningful, and the gist is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"This month's 8th is the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. As we welcome this memorable day, I would like to share my thoughts with the expatriates in China on this important period in Japanese history: Why did we take up arms against Britain and the United States? The Greater East Asia War is a struggle between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon peoples. In other words, it can also be said to be the Japan-US war. The purpose of Japan and the East Asian nations fighting Britain and the United States is not only to drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia, but also to use their own strength to build a new East Asia. China declared war on Britain and the United States in January of this year. On October 30th, China and Japan concluded an alliance treaty, establishing a permanent and unchanging friendly relationship between the two countries, and jointly shouldering the heavy responsibility of building East Asia. As a result, the East Asian nations have concentrated their efforts, and the combat system against Britain and the United States has been clarified at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Conference was a conference for the East Asian nations to join hands to drive out British and American aggression. Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved brilliant victories, and Britain and the United States are still trying to counterattack, resulting in fierce battles between the islands in the South China Sea. However, the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing step by step, and the unity of the Greater East Asian nations is becoming increasingly consolidated. Britain and the United States are extremely threatened by this fact, so Britain and the United States are launching political offensives in addition to military counterattacks. They are using scheming propaganda and attempting to alienate the East Asian nations and the Axis powers. After the Quebec Conference, Britain and the United States held a tripartite conference with the Soviet Union. Recently, after the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang meeting, Roosevelt and Churchill also met with Stalin in Iran. However, their common war aims are not consistent, and their mutual interests are conflicting. Under these circumstances of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, they have never been able to articulate a grand policy like the Greater East Asia Declaration. Although they have repeatedly promoted the so-called "unconditional surrender of Japan" and other nonsensical remarks, the Sixth Bougainville Island naval battle, which echoed the Greater East Asia Conference, resulted in a resounding victory for the Japanese army. The third and fourth great victories in the Gilbert Islands and the results of yesterday's battle in the Marshall Islands, where more than 120 enemy ships were sunk and destroyed. The number of aircraft carriers alone reached 20, and the number of enemy aircraft destroyed was more than 900. This is truly an unprecedented great victory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the soldiers and officers of the front line and the 100 million citizens are united in spirit, all holding the belief and determination that the war will be won. With just this great victory, no amount of enemy rhetoric can conceal it. In the future, the enemy's counterattack will inevitably become more intense, and we must be aware that we will engage in fierce battles in all areas. We must never forget the belief that we will not stop until we have destroyed the enemy. In particular, we who live among the Chinese people should always be aware and need to personally practice the spirit of equality and mutual benefit in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. We should always have a belief in certain victory and an enthusiasm for construction. We firmly believe that once we have a firm belief in certain victory, then the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in building the Greater East Asia order will be realized."</p>

<p>— Kichisaburo Nomura</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope has also vanished.</p>
<p>It is now undeniable that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull engaged in Japanese-American negotiations with preconceived notions. This can be clearly understood from the documents previously released by the U.S. State Department. They did not and did not want to understand the concept of Asia for Asians or the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Can there be compromise in negotiations with such people as opponents? Frankly speaking, I really thought this was a difficult problem. So why did I go to America? As for myself, I had no plan and accepted this important mission. Facing the Emperor above and the people below, I hesitated with indescribable feelings and decided to go. There were several reasons, but what I can say now is only the following: Because of this, I dared to assume the important task of Ambassador to the United States, despite my limitations, to deal with the difficult situation in Japanese-American negotiations. Although it might have been just a glimmer of hope, or just a faint light.</p>
<p>Here we need to recall the situation in the Pacific during the previous World War, especially the Japanese-American relations centered on the Ishii-Lansing Agreement. At that time, the United States of America, harboring the ambition to invade the world, attempted to enforce its policies in the East and the West with an arrogant and overbearing attitude. But the distance between the will of the leaders and the feelings of the people did not allow for sufficient military preparations to realize that ambition, even now. Therefore, during the previous First World War, various difficult issues piled up like mountains between Japan's policy toward China and the United States' policy toward the Far East. As a result, each and every one of them was temporarily compromised, and Japan concluded the Ishii-Lansing Agreement. There is such a past history. Since then, military preparations have been actively strengthened, and ambitions have increased accordingly, but the situation in between does not seem to have changed essentially.</p>
<p>If such a change occurred, it would be tantamount to an act of suicide by the United States. For this reason, no matter how much they boast, because there is no real strength as a background, there is still room for bargaining, and it is not necessarily hopeless to mend Japanese-American relations.</p>
<p>The situation finally deteriorated.</p>
<p>I am a navy man myself. To assume this task, it is essential to be familiar with the Ishii-Lansing Agreement and other situations concerning the Pacific and Japanese-American relations. I often thought that this might not be my forte. I often heard various opinions about Japanese-American negotiations from among the people. But once I accepted it, I should have worked hard to prevent the war from happening, but I was incompetent, and the war finally happened. How can I explain this? I did not fulfill my responsibility. However, for several months, I hesitated, thought, endured, and respected myself, and worked hard to find a solution. After returning to Japan and hearing various things, my thinking has advanced one step further from here. All the means that should have been implemented in the problems between all countries were implemented, and all the policies that should have been requested were investigated, to the point that every possible method was exhausted. Unless it came to a foreign war, it was difficult to hope for a true national unity. We fully understand the Japanese government's policy. On the road to negotiations, we have traveled every possible path we have seen. We will do our best until the very last day.</p>
<p>However, on November 26, the worst situation finally occurred, and the final memorandum was received. Before this, there was a glimmer of hope in the state of failed negotiations. In mid-August, Prime Minister Konoe handed a joint communique to Roosevelt, and at that time, Roosevelt was very moved by the content of this communique. Roosevelt was originally a person who liked this kind of drama very much. He was very happy for a while.</p>
<p>But the State Department, which has been studying Japan and Far East policy in its own way for a long time—the State Department, which has written two hundred and several dozen letters of protest against Japan since the China Incident—did not seem to know about this situation. Later, when I hoped that Ambassador Kurusu would fly to America to provide support, the opportunity to end these talks was mentioned in only one-tenth of the newspapers. What the person in charge of the State Department said to the newspaper reporters was openly a speech expressing despair. So they naturally knew very well about the proposal on November 26, although Japan did not know about it.</p>
<p>After this, according to what the other party said, around this time, the naval commander issued a warning to the army and navy at the front to prepare for war. Also, in the documents recently released by the State Department: "On January 29, the Secretary of State met with the British Ambassador to the United States and told him that the diplomatic aspect of the Japanese-American issue has come to an end, and this issue is now being handled by the army and navy." Many people say that the American side actively prepared for war, waiting for December 8 to arrive, and I mention it casually.</p>
<p>If so, the Roosevelt government kept the American people in the dark, throwing them into the whirlpool of war. As Roosevelt and Hull themselves said, they saw ten years ahead of the American people, and gradually dragged the emotions of the people to their own ambitions. Dragging the tail of Congress, they desperately expanded the military. Peaceful America was filled with the air of war. Provoking the world, the American people were gradually dragged there, and finally entered the war, which spread to the borders of the Solomon Islands and the Aleutian Islands. The scale of that war is far beyond what the previous World War could compare. Roosevelt's rude and presumptuous words, such as absolute victory and unconditional surrender, and the fourteen-point declaration advocated by Wilson, or the idea of preventing revenge wars from occurring after the war, what do the American people think of the huge difference between these two? Under the rule of these two great presidents, I happened to be stationed in Washington twice. Remembering the previous time and the later time together, I cannot help but feel moved. Can the American people fully understand and resonate with the aforementioned policy of world invasion that the Roosevelt administration attempted? Moreover, do you believe that bold, ridiculous words such as absolute victory and unconditional surrender, from the perspective of ordinary common sense, are an unjust purpose that can be achieved with the power of the United States? Can Japan tolerate it? These can only be judged by the American people.</p>
<p>The operational objectives of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>What the Japanese people generally think is that the current war is being fought in a place far away from the Japanese mainland. Whether it is an air raid or a submarine, in short, this war is far away from the Japanese mainland by more than 2,000 miles. This idea is unbreakable. This is a very big mistake. Just by looking at the current strategic position of Japan, it can be immediately understood that the center of Japan, the heart of Japan, is by no means just the Japanese mainland. Although the Japanese mainland certainly has important places, at the same time, in the far reaches of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are also several places that Japan considers most necessary.</p>
<p>The enemy knows this very well. Mr. XX, who is still holding an important position in the United States, etc., said: "Mr. Nomura, Japan seems to be going to war with the United States. But won't it run out of oil first? Japan only bought this little bit of oil from the United States." He raised unbelievable figures and expressed this argument to me, who was running around trying to open up Japanese-American negotiations. Of course, I was not the opponent of that kind of argument, but after carefully studying the places that Japan considered painful, there was not the slightest feeling of gloating. At this time, the heart of Japan is in both parties, in various places in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. These places have the same importance as the Japanese mainland, and the enemy wants to cut them off from the Japanese mainland. I hope to remember this together with the people. The operational objectives of the British and American forces in the Pacific are entirely here.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have always been countries that used blockade tactics as their main strategy. Needless to say, the war methods implemented by the world's major powers are all based on the national conditions of their countries and are the weapons that their countries traditionally excel at, so they cannot be taken lightly. Blockade tactics mean blockading the enemy and freely controlling the sea themselves. The fundamental spirit is to obtain the necessary materials for themselves while preventing the enemy from obtaining the materials they need. From this point of view, the United States previously advocated freedom of the seas, gradually built a large navy, and soon became a 5:5 ratio. This was not enough, and then they planned to double the large navy and call it the two-ocean fleet.</p>
<p>This attempt to simultaneously suppress the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans clearly shows the idea of using sea control to control the world. This will ultimately come down to the navy. When their own strength is insufficient, they advocate freedom of the seas, but now they want to allow the Stars and Stripes to cruise freely on the seas. The US Navy's policy after the expiry of the naval treaty has been acting with this point as the center, and it is clear. Hicks and others take every opportunity to proclaim freedom of the seas without any scruples. Suppressing the world's oceans, monopolizing the world's resources, and not stopping until they dominate the world—this is the great ambition of American imperialism.</p>
<p>The fundamental strategy is the blockade policy.</p>
<p>After I took office in Washington, I personally felt the rapid changes in US naval policy and could not help but be frightened for the American people. During the previous World War, when Wilson was president, I was a naval attache in Washington. Wilson also tried his best to advocate interventionist policies, but compared with Roosevelt, there was a world of difference in scale. With heaven-sent abundance and abundant resources, why do Americans living in the American continent have to bury the rights and lives of free American citizens in the mountains and dense forests, in the coral reefs and [blank] of the deep sea, as far as the ends of the earth in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea? There is only one answer, and that is the ambitious world policy of President Visforth, who is most enthusiastic about the recent major military plan. Their intended war aims against Japan, of course, focus on the above points. Therefore, while conducting psychological warfare to confuse people and perhaps guerrilla actions as one of the means of war, the fundamental emphasis is still on blockade warfare, cutting off the connection between the south and the Japanese homeland and hindering the supply of necessary materials, so that Japan cannot carry out the war. Judging from the traditions of laughing countries and the recent expansion of the naval policy, the strategy currently adopted against Japan is not only the most likely one for blockade warfare, but also the fundamental strategy.</p>
<p>In short, we should recognize that the heart of Japan is in the Japanese mainland, and also in the far reaches of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan's self-reliance and prosperity depend on the self-reliance and prosperity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then they can be implemented thoroughly. We cannot fail to know that MacArthur is desperately trying to take back Rabaul, and Mountbatten is eyeing us from the Indian Ocean. The two enemy maritime forces in the east and west are waiting for an opportunity. From this point of view, the five principles of the East Asia Joint Declaration are extremely important and as bright as the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>Coexistence and co-prosperity, respect for independence, promotion of culture, economic reciprocity, thorough abolition of racial discrimination, and opening up resources to the world—these are ideas that countries around the world have shared for many years and hoped to realize. They have been hindered by the selfishness of various nations and have not been implemented to this day. Now, the nations of East Asia are running ahead of the European and American powers and will realize them. This is a major event in history, internationally, and even humanely, and Japan's war goals are indeed of the greatest importance.</p>
<p>The American people cannot help but humbly listen to this joint declaration of the nations of East Asia. When you humbly and frankly read the spirit of this great declaration, how will you explain the cruel reality of throwing the lives of tens of thousands of your compatriots into the Solomon Sea and the dense forests of New Guinea?

<p>Madrid, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch: The New York correspondent of the Arriba newspaper stated that a recent meeting decided to unify the Anglo-American command. It is expected that General Marshall will be the commander of the Anglo-American forces in Europe, General Eisenhower will succeed Marshall as US Chief of Staff, and the person who will succeed Eisenhower in his original position may be General Alexander, the British Deputy Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. The Western newspaper correspondent also stated that the merger only refers to the command of the Anglo-American forces. As for the Soviet Union, it can still fight independently.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch: A report from London relayed from Moscow stated that Stalin has returned to Moscow from Tehran. Personnel from the British Embassy in the Soviet Union said that Churchill and Roosevelt have also left Tehran. According to sources related to Soviet affairs, the Tehran conference is more willing to have an expression of action than to see it only in words, so the communique has not been released for a long time. Stalin would not have gained nothing after such a long journey.</p>
<p>Belgrade, 6th (Central News Agency) – Spałajković commented on the Iranian meeting in the "Novo Vreme" newspaper, stating that Stalin, under the pretext of shortening the war, has placed seven hands on the throats of the anti-Axis powers and demanded that they rape Turkey. Stalin is very anxious, because the Rhine River is too far away, while the Balkans are much closer. Tito, Dimitrov, and Vinnish are Stalin's experts on Balkan issues, and Stalin listens to them. These three advocate demanding the opening of the Dardanelles as the gateway to the Balkans. Churchill's demand for Germany's unconditional surrender is a great opportunity for Stalin to propose and demand the opening of the Dardanelles as a shortcut to achieving this goal.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from New York: US Senators Wheeler and Johnson delivered a broadcast speech yesterday, reviewing post-war issues and advocating that the United States should cooperate closely with various countries after the war. Wheeler, an isolationist, stated his reasons for adopting new insights, believing that the United States is in a position of world power and must take this path. He suggested organizing the United States of Europe to form an economic group, and that the current economic situation does not allow for the restoration of the pre-war economic state. Johnson also advocated close international cooperation after the war, warning against repeating the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles. Republican Prosser demanded that the United States guide international affairs. He opposed ideas that transcend the nation and rejected the ideal of joint British-American citizenship.</p>

<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report: German planes heavily attacked the Allied supply base of Bari Harbor on the night of the 3rd, sinking enemy ships totaling over 30,000 tons. This included one merchant ship of 10,000 tons, another of 6,000 tons, one oil tanker of 15,000 tons, and one ammunition ship of 4,500 tons. In addition, nine other merchant ships and one warship of 5,500 tons were also hit. The latter ships sank soon after. The weather that night was excellent, and flares illuminated the targets, making it easy for low-flying aircraft to aim. When the German planes attacked again, the oil tanker caught fire. As the German bombers arrived at their destination, a convoy approached the harbor and was immediately bombed, suffering numerous hits. As the German planes returned, they saw the ammunition ship exploding. Bari is an Allied supply base on the eastern coast of Italy, its importance comparable to Naples on the west coast.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report: After the failure of the British Eighth Army's breakthrough and encirclement strategy, localized battles ensued, and the situation in southern Italy has eased. Although the British army had air and artillery support, their advance has been halted by German forces. German military sources believe that although the British army advanced several kilometers, it contributed little to the plan to occupy Rome. Two British tank units, assisted by armored vehicles, attacked near San Vito along the coast but were repelled. German forces recaptured the town of Frisa south of that location. Near Orsogna and Guardiagrele, only artillery and reconnaissance activities by the British army were observed. On the western front, the U.S. Fifth Army shelled German positions. The U.S. and British forces engaged in only localized activities there. In the mountainous region of the Tyrrhenian coast, the U.S. army attacked near Calabritto but was repelled by German forces from the high ground. On the Cassino front, U.S. forces attacked north and south of Mignano during inclement weather but were repelled by German assault troops. British and American reconnaissance units in the mountains of Isernia were ambushed near Filignano and strafed by German machine guns.</p>

<p>Helsinki, 5th (Central News Agency) - In light of December 6th being Finnish Independence Day, the Finnish newspaper "Social Democrat" published a short article reviewing the various stages of Finland's struggle for independence. Finland first became independent twenty-six years ago, amidst ongoing internal strife and mutual killing. By 1939, the country had gradually unified, and all disputes between the so-called Red and White factions had dissolved. The Finnish people, with five times their previous strength and the latest weaponry, united to face foreign enemies. However, the enemy used despicable means against the small Finnish nation. On December 6th, 1939, Molotov, speaking for the Soviet Union, declared to the world that the Soviet Union maintained friendly relations with democratic Finland and had no demands whatsoever. This was truly the most contemptible statement of a hypocrite. Currently, the Finnish nation faces the same enemy. Finland will never yield until it achieves final victory.</p>

One hundred grams of bread is definitely not enough to sustain one person's life. If the Allies could provide assistance, most political disputes could be easily resolved.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) Metal resources are among the most important materials in wartime. As the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive phase, ensuring these resources becomes even more critical. Municipal authorities from both China and Japan have designated the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, December 8th, as the starting date for a metal collection campaign. The initial target for the first phase is 30,000 tons of ferrous metals, 500 tons of copper, as well as lead, zinc, and other metals. Metal collection committees organized by both Chinese and Japanese sides will be responsible for carrying out this effort.</p>
<p>Mayor's Statement</p>
<p>Mayor Chen stated: "The launching of the waste metal collection and purchase campaign in Shanghai on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is of profound and significant importance, needless to say. In times of war, all belligerent nations rigorously control materials to ensure resources and aim for the completion of the war. Metal is an important material related to warfare. Now that the Greater East Asia War has victoriously unfolded, in order to assist our allies in achieving a complete victory as soon as possible, we should launch this campaign. For the above reasons, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has established a Metal Collection Committee to handle the collection and purchase of waste metals."</p>
<p>Implementation Measures</p>
<p>To facilitate understanding by all sectors, the implementation measures for this event are explained as follows:</p>
<p>Scope and Methods of Collection and Purchase. The scope of waste metal collection and purchase includes ferrous metals, copper, aluminum, zinc, tin, and other non-ferrous metals. The collection of waste metals from municipal government offices, schools, public places, factories, large stores, and streets will be without compensation. However, for collection from small stores and households, in addition to encouraging donations, purchasing methods will also be adopted.</p>
<p>Start Date. The collection and purchase period is set to begin on December 8th, 1943.</p>
<p>Implementation Methods. A. Collection of waste metals from government offices, schools, and public places: The responsible authorities and the First and Second Police Bureaus are instructed to investigate and report, and are required to investigate all waste metals, list them clearly, and submit the list to the municipal government for extraction. B. Collection of waste metals from factories and large stores: Except for items related to production, such as machinery, which are absolutely not included in the collection, other waste metals will be donated by members of the municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, and then submitted to the municipal government on a monthly basis. C. Collection of waste metals from the streets: The Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Health, in conjunction with the public works offices of the one to eight districts, are responsible for conducting cleaning operations, paying attention to submitting these items at any time. D. Collection of waste metals from general households: The Propaganda Department and the Baojia Offices will cooperate to ensure that people actively donate and submit them to the Baojia organizations, which will transfer them to the First Police Bureau and the Municipal Government Baojia Committee, which will then submit them to the municipal government on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Purchase Implementation Methods. A. The formulation of standard prices will be carefully studied by the Economic Bureau, convening relevant guilds, and determined by the municipal government. B. Purchase methods and procedures: The Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee will publish the standard prices of waste metals in newspapers. If people voluntarily sell waste metals, they should first send them to their respective Baojia offices for storage, and a temporary receipt will be issued. The Baojia offices will create a register of sellers and the quantity sold, and submit it to their respective competent authorities for submission to the municipal government for record. C. Method and procedures for issuing funds: The Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee will issue the purchase funds to the competent authorities according to the register of sellers and the quantity sold in each district, based on the standard prices. The Baojia offices will then transfer the funds to the sellers to collect. D. The storage of waste metals: The municipal government will establish a storage committee to be responsible for safekeeping. Members of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee: Zhao, Pan, Wu Songbi, Ying, Su Chengde, Xu Tianshen, Ye Song, Zhang, Sun Mingqi, Lin Jiong'an, Yuan Jufan.</p>
<p>Tajiri's Statement</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri stated that the joint Chinese-Japanese metal collection campaign launched under the cooperation of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is a timely move given the current war situation. Steel and other non-ferrous metals are important war materials. Therefore, the effective use of what is no longer important or needed to enhance war capabilities is the duty of every citizen. The resource-rich United Kingdom and the United States have long been actively collecting metals. Thus, the joint Chinese-Japanese effort to contribute metal resources is a manifestation of the spirit of cooperation in the war between the peoples of China and Japan. It is hoped that China and Japan will work together to achieve great results.</p>
<p>Collection Outline</p>
<p>Collection Agencies: Both Chinese and Japanese sides will organize metal collection committees to develop collection plans and handle various matters. The metal collection committees will establish administrative bureaus to handle administrative affairs. Chinese-Japanese Liaison Method: The Chinese and Japanese committees will hold joint meetings at any time. Important matters will be decided by the general meeting. The Chinese and Japanese administrative bureaus should maintain close contact on practical matters to ensure consistent steps. Scope of Metal Collection: Ferrous metals, copper, lead, zinc, tin, and other non-ferrous metals. Collection Items: The first phase (December 8th to the end of March) is limited to easily collected metal products. A cleaning campaign will be carried out in the streets, government offices, public facilities, general households, and general factories. After the third phase, it will be gradually strengthened, such as mandatory provision, demolition, and suspension of factory equipment. Collection Period: Starting December 8th, 1943. Collection Target: For the first phase, 30,000 tons of ferrous metals, 500 tons of copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, and as many other non-ferrous metals as possible. From the second phase onwards, targets will be progressively increased depending on the situation. Collection Order: First, cleaning government offices and public facilities; then, cleaning general factories, businesses, and households. Dates will be specified separately by region. Collection Methods: For collection from street facilities, public facilities, and government offices, the committee will directly contact the owners and collect the items after handover. For some street facilities and general household items to be collected, Baojia personnel will be mobilized to be responsible for the collection. Items provided by military-managed enemy properties and factories will be collected by the committee through the enemy property management committee. For items provided by general factories and businesses, the Chinese side will be assisted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Japanese side will be collected by various industry groups. Other items to be collected will be collected directly by the committee. Handling of Items to Be Removed: The removal of specifically designated items should be directly carried out by the committee. Private individuals are prohibited from freely dismantling them. Other items should be dismantled and provided by the providers. If the provider wishes the committee to handle the dismantling, they may do so. The providers will handle the sorting and other matters after dismantling. However, the committee will handle it if necessary. Transportation: The transportation of collected items will be handled by the committee, members of civilian organizations, to ensure speed. If necessary, military authorities will be asked for assistance. Storage: Before disposal, the collected items will be kept in a suitable place by the committee. Compensation: In principle, the policy is to purchase at a fair price, but donations from all sectors are encouraged. Disposal: All collected metal items will be provided for military needs.</p>

<h3 id="e39">New Price Ceilings Set for Coal Briquettes and Coal, About Ten Yuan for 250 Coal Briquettes <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The First District Office, in cooperation with the Japanese authorities, has recently set new price ceilings for coal briquettes and officially announced them. These new price ceilings are extremely low. The unit is one metric ton, or twenty dan (each dan weighing one hundred jin in the market). Calculated based on this unit, 250 coal briquettes should sell for approximately ten yuan in national currency at retail stores. The authorities have also set limits on the quality of the coal briquettes. The coal dust content in the coal briquettes produced by each coal briquette factory must not be less than 75%. In the future, if citizens suspect the quality of coal briquettes purchased from retail stores, they can report it to Office No. 191 of the Economic Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road for verification.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Rationing to Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>In the near future, coal briquettes will be rationed per capita at the newly set price ceilings. However, before the preparations for the implementation of this plan are completed, the above-mentioned new price ceilings will apply to all coal briquettes currently sold. If citizens encounter coal merchants selling at inflated prices or selling substandard goods, they should immediately report it to the authorities for investigation in order to cooperate.</p>
<p>Price Ceilings for Coal Also Specified</p>
<p>In addition to adjusting the selling price of coal briquettes, the authorities have also revised the price ceilings for various grades of bituminous coal and anthracite coal. These price ceilings are also based on one metric ton (equivalent to eight standard baskets). Each basket of coal, including the basket itself, weighs 290 pounds, or approximately 131.5 kilograms. The quality of each grade of coal has also been specified separately. Standards have also been set for the coal dust content of various grades of unrefined coal and coal lumps. Citizens with questions can inquire at the Economic Department at No. 109 Jiangxi Road, the Coal Merchants Association at No. 12 Waibaidu Bridge, or the Dazhonglian Coal Company at No. 33 Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Excess Coal Stocks to Be Rationed</p>
<p>The currently announced price ceilings for bituminous coal and anthracite coal are mainly applicable to the sale of coal to users who have been formally approved. However, these price ceilings are also effective for all coal stocks held by coal merchants that exceed the rationed amount. In order to ration these excess coal stocks, the Economic Department plans to conduct registration for industrial and commercial users and households. The registration deadline will be announced within two weeks. Once approved, applicants will be allocated coal at the new price ceilings starting in January next year.</p>

<p>The annual year-end settlement period for banks and money shops is approaching, and they are preparing for settlement. It is reported that interest will be paid separately on savings, commercial accounts, and other parts.</p>
<p>Settlement Dates</p>
<p>The settlement date for the savings department is the 20th, and the commercial department is the 25th. However, the settlement of interest for the savings department of banks such as Zhejiang Industrial Bank has already been implemented at the end of last month. As for loans from various industries, such as overdrafts and credit loans, they must be repaid before the year-end settlement period, unless otherwise specified in the contract. According to convention, new loans will be temporarily suspended during this year-end settlement period, except for the legitimate needs of various industries. It is also reported that the Banking Joint Reserve Council and the Money Shops Joint Reserve are striving to accommodate the interbank lending of member banks and money shops within the possible scope, but they must provide collateral and follow the interbank lending methods. The preparation for legitimate uses of various banks and money shops, and for businesses, has also been done separately, to ensure a smooth year-end settlement period.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Interbank Lending in Money Shops Depends on Sufficient Reserves <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shops Joint Reserve, in order to emphasize the creditworthiness of various money shops and prevent accidents, in addition to strictly limiting the amount of money each shop must deposit as the Reserve Fund before participating in interbank transactions and bill clearing, requires each shop with a need for interbank transactions and interbank lending to pay the reserve assets within the specified limits. Any interbank exchange transactions, remitting and settling accounts, or interbank lending that exceeds the reserve or deposit amount should be supplemented with the corresponding difference to balance the accounts daily.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds. Yesterday, the prices of government bonds varied widely. Class C bonds fell slightly, while miscellaneous bonds rose.

Class C bonds initially rose in early trading yesterday, but then gradually declined. The final price at noon was slightly lower than the price at the end of last week, while Classes A, B, D, and E all saw increases.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Shop Association remained unchanged at 1.8%, and interbank lending was tight again.</p>

<h3 id="e46">On the Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The unified purchase and distribution of cotton by the Cotton Control Committee is currently being actively promoted in accordance with the established plan. The focus of current consideration is on determining the cotton purchase price, raising and using the purchase funds, and establishing public warehouses in the central areas of the cotton-producing regions. These three points are analyzed and reviewed below: Regarding the price of cotton purchases, like other agricultural products, the price ceiling should not be too low, which would disappoint farmers. As a result, not only will farmers be reluctant to sell the cotton they have harvested, but they may even change the unplanted cotton fields to plant other crops, such as miscellaneous grains, which will have a significant impact on future cotton production. Therefore, the purchase price must be appropriately increased after considering the situation. Regarding the raising of purchase funds, if only the purchasers handle it themselves, it is feared that neither the raising nor the use can reach the ideal state. The authorities should assist in or finance it, such as in the North China Agricultural Increase Plan, where the Cotton Industry Revitalization Association provides financing for cotton production increases based on the increased output per unit area of cotton. Therefore, in Central China, the cotton control authorities should cooperate and provide loans from national banks. Regarding the establishment of public warehouses in cotton-producing areas, it is heard that the locations are not limited to Nantong and Shanghai, but are spread to other cotton-producing areas, which is a reasonable approach. In addition, in terms of storage, attention must be paid to the equipment of the public warehouses to prevent the risk of fire and water.</p>
<p>As for the unified distribution, it is said that the premise is to allocate to various factories for manufacturing, and the specific methods are being drafted. Now that the price of cloth has been approved, distribution can be implemented. At the same time, the Commercial Control Committee announced that the free purchase and sale of cloth will not be restored, then the quantity of cloth distribution must be reasonably increased so that the people will not be unable to keep warm. However, sufficient distribution depends on sufficient production. In order to promote the production of cloth, cotton must be supplied to various factories as much as possible for the manufacture of cloth. This is what the factories that manufacture cloth hope for, and especially what the people who receive cloth distribution hope for.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks entered a a consolidation phase, with most gains retreating and prices falling. This was attributed to the tightening of credit and weakened investor confidence. However, the World Book Company continued to surge on positive news, and New Asia Construction showed strong stability.

<p>Regarding the implementation of the 52nd, 53rd, and 54th rice purchase coupons, it is determined that from December 8th to December 20th of this year, retail oil stores shall sell cooking oil upon presentation of the 52nd rice purchase coupon. The store should sell four city ounces of raw oil or soybean oil for seven yuan in national currency, including the two [unclear - unit of measurement] retail tax, upon receiving each coupon marked with the store's number. Furthermore, the retail addresses for this distribution of cooking oil are different from those listed on the previously issued 3rd and 4th oil purchase certificates.

<p>The eleventh-month sugar for this city will be managed by the sugar merchants' cooperative, having obtained approval from the military authorities. The procedure of picking up goods has already begun. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, this period's sugar is expected to begin its universal sale around the 10th.

<p>The Existence of Isolationists</p>
<p>But unless our military force is defeated to the uttermost extreme, there is absolutely a second way to end this war. Only after the enemy's naval power is uprooted will the opportunity for the Americans to initially awaken arrive. The accumulation of vast war results obtained by Solomon now will make it increasingly difficult for the United States, soon reaching a turning point in determining the outcome of the war. Even if there are various weaknesses in the United States, such as internal riots, that merely stimulate and induce the war situation to gradually become more serious, its military force remains solid as before. While the war is proceeding slowly, no weakness should be expected to have an excessive impact on it.</p>
<p>What the United States is doing now is what the Americans call interventionism. Whether it is isolationism or interventionism, its content changes slightly with the times, but today isolationists still exist in the United States in considerable numbers. Even among powerful politicians, there are such isolationists. Although their numbers are small, they were quite influential before the war. After the war began, isolationism was called [unclear - term] and disappeared, but the existence of isolationism is a stark reality.</p>
<p>However, it must be especially noted here that these isolationists, regarding the recent situation in the Pacific, strongly advocate [unclear - extreme view] on matters related to Japan. American trends have always placed special emphasis on the Pacific. Even the isolationist faction has broken its previous silence on this matter, acting like active supporters of the government, speaking tough. We must not overlook this fact either. If isolationists have the power to act as an opposition party, then the current government will add another failure to its failures, which is when Japan's military force pierces the enemy's heart.</p>
<p>Weaknesses—Race and Strikes</p>
<p>The second weakness of the United States is the race problem. For example, although statistics vary, there are approximately five to six million German Americans, four to five million Italian Americans, and roughly the same number of Irish Americans. In addition, there are very many immigrants from Southern and Northern Europe. Black people number twelve to thirteen million. With Anglo-Saxons at the center, these various races are united on the first point of being American, but what if the war goes unfavorably, the war is prolonged, and this race problem combines with other social problems? Compared to Japan, how big and how important is the American weakness?</p>
<p>Speaking of the recent intensified strike problem, my view is this. Within the disputes, there are roughly various political and ideological machinations—but the mainstream is still economic reasons. As for rebelling against the national order, it doesn't seem to reach that point! It is generally believed that [unclear - something] knows nothing about the current situation! In short, prices are gradually rising, reportedly about one percent per month, and have risen by twenty-five percent in the past two years. On the one hand, the government fears inflation and implements methods such as fixed wages and fixed prices, but taxes are rising daily, so prices cannot be suppressed. Fixed wages are in fact becoming impossible. Due to a shortage of supplies, life is becoming more difficult. This is the main reason for the repeated strikes. The organization of the American labor movement is very powerful, and some even say it is a major enemy of the Roosevelt administration. Following the progress of the war, due to the urgent need for industry, the intensification of disputes has expanded its power. According to recent reports, strike incidents often lead to the deployment of troops for suppression. So, it is natural that I said earlier that this has become a major problem in the United States. But even so, setting aside the success of our military force and placing excessive expectations is a matter that requires great caution.</p>
<p>A Country Bound by Public Opinion</p>
<p>The United States is indeed a so-called country of public opinion. Even a president, when faced with things that surprise the nation, tirelessly tries to influence public opinion. On the contrary, for this reason, he has finally become a captive of the public opinion he himself created. He must always consider public opinion and is always bound by public opinion. Whenever I met with the president and the secretary of state, I felt this way. This is different from so-called respect for public opinion. Their minds can no longer leave public opinion, unable to take a step away from it.</p>
<p>That the US-Japan negotiations could not be hopeful no matter what. Newspapers said that the chance of the negotiations ending successfully was less than one in ten. With American public opinion at this point, even if the president was moved by Japan's views during the talks, the president could do nothing. Roosevelt himself may have thought that war was unavoidable and that he had to do this, but I want to say, that's not the case. He could not rely on public opinion no matter what. He could not carefully consider the great hundred-year plan for the US-Japan relationship from a higher place than public opinion. This is the characteristic of the fate of American politicians. After ten months of talks, I wondered why he couldn't take a step forward, but I couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>The Future of the War is Difficult</p>
<p>In short, this is one aspect of the powerful activity of public opinion in the country of public opinion—the United States. On the one hand, it says that the war is progressing smoothly, while on the other hand, it drives the people to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and repeatedly loses battles. This exposes the big talk of America's war aims, but public opinion doesn't know it. Perhaps this is the aforementioned weakness of the United States, which permeates this public opinion and eventually dominates everything. American leaders fear public opinion more than anything else. Even if they have accumulated such powerful military equipment, is it used to travel across the oceans and wage an unreasonable war of world invasion? When the war is unfavorable, do they stubbornly defend themselves and drag the people to the end? At this point, why is the United States still concealing the truth of its defeats from its people? Even though the situation is becoming unfavorable, it still has to forcibly delay things. Americans probably like to gamble, that is, they are a nation of speculative risks. Next year is the presidential election, and the results of the elections in various places are unfavorable to the Democratic Party. Facing this political turning point, they must in some way get the people to agree with this aspect. Launching large fleets to the Solomon Islands one after another, America's war intentions are indeed terrifying, and its strategy is also very dynamic. If they encounter weak enemies, they will surely achieve great success. But confronting a strong enemy like Japan is exactly what we want.</p>
<p>The Beginning of Victory Has Been Created Already. The Japanese people will not become complacent because of these war results, and the enemy, the United States, will probably not be afraid because of this either. The former will become increasingly serious, and after twists and turns, it still lies in the future. (End of full text) (Sho: From the Yomiuri Hochi from November 19th to 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e53">On Liu Haisu's Oil Paintings <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Modern art, since Impressionism, started a revolution of color, and finally buried its future in dazzling mediocrity. The one who rose to the world art scene in its place should be Cezanne, the great artist who advocated the expression of self and inner truth.</p>
<p>He negated the objective reproduction and capture of momentary impressions, pursuing the eternity of art. The shining light of the 20th-century world art scene should really be attributed to Cezanne, the father of this emerging art.</p>
<p>Mr. Haisu, who has a sweeping talent, naturally follows the path that Cezanne took in his efforts in oil painting. In other words, he starts from Cezanne's realism, expressing his own noble and great character, and indomitable personality. "Snow in Luxembourg", "Cockscomb", and "Lingyin Temple" can be used as clear explanations of this aspect. His method is rigorous and full of the fervor and reverence of color.</p>
<p>Mr. Haisu also has a fiery passion, so he also likes to use colors like gold, vermilion, cyan, and sky blue like Van Gogh. "Express Train", "Purple Hydrangea", and "Smoky Haze" have such a feeling, but in Van Gogh's fervor and intensity, there seems to be a tragic cry, with a terrible fate hidden, while he is only magnificent and splendid.</p>
<p>We must also pay attention to Mr. Haisu's continuous exploration of the art of his ancestors and his pursuit of the path of Chinese new art creation. This seems to be felt more strongly in his Chinese paintings, but the grandeur of "Mount Babadayang Volcano", the vigor of "Phoenix Tree" and "Buffalo", the solidity of "White Horse" and "Pagoda", and the simplicity of "Remnant Lotus" and "Cormorant", does this not point out a new style of oil painting? It is the creation after the fusion of Chinese and foreign ancient and modern cultures, and it is precisely Mr. Haisu's unique creation in art.</p>
<p>Originally, the essence of art is not in the object being copied, but in the ability to create one's own inner world, so the purer the art, the more it can express this inner spirit.</p>
<p>(Note) Mr. Liu Haisu's exhibition has been held for several days, and the audience has been very large. It will close on the eleventh of this month.</p>

<p>East Asia Cultural Association Councilors' Meeting</p>
<p>Recently, the most noteworthy development in the cultural world has been the convocation of the eighth general meeting of councilors of the East Asia Cultural Association. This meeting was held on [unclear - date] at the joint office of Peking University in Songgongfu Lane in Laicheng. The general meeting of councilors was held in the morning, and proposals and reports were discussed. On the morning of the 27th, specialized meetings of literature, law, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and other departments were held at the Peking University College of Liberal Arts to study the direction of academic progress. The general meeting was held again at the Peking University President's Office in the afternoon. First, the results of the discussions in the morning were reported by each specialized department. Later, the person in charge of the Cultural Association was elected, and Zhou Zuoren was re-elected as president, with Wang Pintang as honorary president and Chuan Zengxiang and Wang賀Rang as vice presidents. At the same time, new councilors were elected: Toda Seizo, Kusano Shunsuke, Mashima Toshiyuki, Zhang Chunlin, Shen Rong, Wu Xiangqi, Jiang Bingran, Lin Chunxiong, Inagaki Juntai, Matsumoto Manabu, etc. The most important resolution of this conference was to request the government to organize a "National Thought Research Institute," stating that this research institute should be affiliated with Peking University, with professors from the College of Arts and Law of Peking University as the core researchers. Foreigners would be invited to assist, and the research results would be published in Peking University's thesis collection. In addition, research on hygiene and food problems were also topics discussed at this conference. It is now okay to list the list of Chinese representatives to this conference below:</p>

<h3 id="e55">Methods for Preventing Lung Disease <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Sheng</p>
<p>Lung disease is a respiratory system disease. The respiratory system is in constant contact with the outside world and is most susceptible to disease. Therefore, the "Inner Classic" says that the lungs are delicate and cannot withstand evil invasion, which is what it describes. As for the transition from the disease period or from recuperation to social activities, it is a great transformation in the process. In terms of employment, everyone knows that outdoor work such as gardening or forestry is the most suitable. But at this time of food shortage, obtaining a job is not easy. How many can get a job as ideal as desired? It must be known that the relationship between lung disease and occupation is relative rather than absolute. Furthermore, if lung disease is cured by [unclear - medical term] to treat the root cause, then the person's original essence has been restored, and qi and blood have been replenished, and it is no longer the old view of the past. Therefore, the way to choose a career can be broadened.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an even worse habit in Shanghai, which is late sleeping. This bad habit is rarely found in rural areas, although it is partly due to the nature of occupations in the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai. However, there are also many who do not go to bed early for non-essential reasons. It must be known that sleep is the most thorough rest. People work hard all day long and rely on sleep to restore their spirit. [unclear - medical term] is due to insufficient original essence and yin deficiency, and sound sleep can best restore what has been consumed. Washing feet with hot water at night can harmonize the blood vessels and promote sound sleep.</p>
<p>The way to treat the root cause of lung disease lies in nourishing yin and replenishing the lungs. In addition, inhalation therapy can allow the medicine to directly reach the lungs and has a quick effect. However, this must be done after a doctor's examination. If you want to seek self-treatment and get the effect of tonifying the lungs, then Chinese pharmacies have ready-made tonic medicines called Qiong Yu Paste. It is made by decocting codonopsis, rehmannia, poria, and white honey. It can be taken once each morning and evening, one or two spoons each time, and it also has the effect of nourishing.</p>

<p>Taoists Ai Langxuan, Liu Yongxiang, [unclear - name] Hongqing, Zhou Yangzhen, Zhang Weixin, and Wang Qiquan initiated the establishment of the China Taoist General Association. After reporting to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Welfare for record, it is heard that preparations are complete and it will soon be established. Hundreds of people have joined the association. The association, noting that the cold winter has arrived, has specially printed tens of thousands of congee vouchers. Each voucher is worth two yuan for congee. In addition to the association bearing a certain amount, those who are benevolent can also purchase vouchers from the Tongbai Palace General Office on Weihaiwei Road to distribute. It is also heard that some great benefactors have each donated 100 sets of cotton clothing, which will be distributed by the general association at the Bai [unclear - name] Temple on Fangxie Road.</p>
