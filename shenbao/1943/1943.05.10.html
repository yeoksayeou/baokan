<p>社評</p>
<h3>怎樣實踐新政治道德</h3>
<p>「刷新政治」，「修明政治」，是今天人民對於政府迫切的要求，這要求的目的，無疑是建立强有力的政府，担當復興國家的任務。我們爲此，曾屢次申論國家興衰之道，以就正於當局。友邦人士吉田先生對此問題，也曾撰文論列，（載五月七日本報）其結論就中國社會的特質與實際需要，提出建立「新道德」一點。新道德，是指一般國民共應具備者而言，我們認爲一般國民固須建立新道德，而同時政府必先實踐新政治道德，以爲國民實踐新道德之先導。</p>
<p>什麼是「新政治道德」？扼要的說，以解除民生疾苦，復興國家爲目的，確立一種適合現時代政治環境的政治信條，且從政府本身做起。這裏我們提出原則三點，以供研討：</p>
<p>第一，是「天下爲公」國家爲人民所公有，所以，執政者一切政治措施，應完全以人民之利益爲前提。「大道之行也，天下爲公」。目前我們已經是「中華民國」，中華全民公有的國家，絕對不是少數人或是一個政黨所私有的國家。國民黨創始者孫先生，也諄諄以「天下爲公」爲三民主義的最高目標。「以黨治國」者，乃是以主義去爭取民心；亦即「以德服人」，替民衆謀利益。政府要澈底表現天下爲公的精神，首先須做到「用人惟才」，而不能「用人惟私」，「惟親」，「惟同鄉」。譬如蔣介石以國同黑與中國爲其一人所私有、，任用顢頇貪汚的孔祥熙，歷久盤踞要津，而孔之子女輩，稚氣未脫，竟居金融界顯要職位，這一種因「裙帶關係」而用人惟私惟親，視「國」與「黨」爲私有，畢竟演變至政治黑暗，民怨沸騰，侷促於中國之「堪察加」。我們必須引爲炯戒，而極力倡導「用人惟才」。其次，執政者要有大政治家的氣度，不要以爲順我者皆是，逆我者皆非，要以虛心下問的態度，重視民間輿論的批評，必須有接受的雅量。如果不問是非，只以反對者批評者都爲逆我而務去之後快，這是閉塞政洽修明的障礙物。總之，一切爲公，這是新政治道德應行實踐的第一點。</p>
<p>第二，是「重視民意」民意就是人民共同的意思，也就是人民共同的要求。這意思，這要求，常常在民間輿論中反映出來。政府決定政策，推行政令，決不能憑少數人的主觀，閉門造車，而須事前事後，聽取人民意見，博採輿論，爲適時適地的修正，尤其是爲人民大多數利益打算。譬如：囤積投機，抽雅片，賭博，官吏經商等等的肅淸，於大多數人民爲有利，那末，對於貫澈這種政令，就必須雷厲風行，堅持到底。這種大多數人民有利的事情，就是人民共同的意思，共同的要求，政府必須重視之，俯順之。這是新政治道德應行實踐的第二點。</p>
<p>第三，是「賞罰嚴明」這爲促進行政效率的重要因素。有功績，有勞動者，不予適當獎賞，則無以獎勵進步；營私者，凟職者，不予適當懲罰，則無以儆戒刁頑。賞罰不明，政治機構，將變成無是無非之混濁天地，而使有爲者，堙沒而喟嘆消沉；狡黠者，投機而氣燄囂張；頑蠢者，更尸位而志得意滿。人事上才智不肖，紊亂顚倒，結果暮氣萎靡，醜能畢露。孔子說：「名不正則言不順，言不順則事不成，事不成則禮樂不興，禮樂不興則刑罰不中，刑罰不中則民無所措手足。」正因爲今日是非不明，賞罰不分，以致政治無正軌，社會無公論；然而，欲求賞罰嚴明，不在規章訂得周密，令文說得動聽，而要在絕不徇私，破除情面，如果應罰者，愈有背景，就愈應重罰，那末，風行草偃，社會觀感必爲之一新，政治修明，從此發軔。這是新政治道德應行實踐的第三點。</p>
<p>「天下爲公」，「重視民意」，「賞罰嚴明」，是新政治道德的前提。進一步就在乎實踐精神，也就是儒家思想中的所謂「信義」。孟子論政，以足食足兵守信爲三要，不得已而去其三之二，則必須守信，因爲民無信不立。孟子又主張凡大義所在，當不顧一切勇往直前。所以說：「所欲有甚於生者，舍生而取義也」。我們講新政治道德就必須從政者堅持信義。一切有利於人民的政策不定則已，如果定了出來，就必須兌現切實施行，這是對內的「信」。協同日本對英美宣戰，就必須實踐戰時生活，貢獻一切協力作戰，這是對外的「信」。</p>
<p>最後我們要創造一個燦爛莊嚴的中華民國，正像工程師建築大厦一樣，須用新方法去建築。要上層越高，就得地基越深，而所挖出的陳土須丟開得越遠。這陳土就是目前政治上的舊習氣舊派頭，凡事只講場面不顧實際，只知修飾不顧踐行，只愛捧塲，不受忠諫，只講敷衍，不肯認眞；而這地基，眞就是我們上面所說的新政治道德。我們只有將這些陳土拋得遠，才會把地基打得深，而也只有地基打得深，那麼，將來中華民國的大厦也更建築得巍哦燦爛與莊嚴！</p>

<p>仰光九日中央社電緬甸獨立準備委昌會，八日舉行成立典禮，緬甸之獨立乃由是發軔。印度獨立聯盟緬甸支部長區里姆干尼，於八日發表談話如次：緬甸獨立準備委員會成立後，緬甸之前途益見光明，該會之任務，旨在以自己之主權與責任，建立新緬甸，此種成就，全係出於　政府之友誼態度所賜。日本已迅速履行對緬甸允諾，由此足證明緬甸在此後短期間內將發展爲一獨立國家，我等印人目擊緬甸之積極向獨立邁進，曷勝欣快，蓋此事正暗示印度所必趨途徑也。今將建設緬甸之責任，畀與緬人，誠屬賢明之舉。</p>
<p>仰光九日中央社電　八日爲緬甸光輝獨立之準備第一日，仰光各街道充滿緬甸萬歲之歡呼聲浪，全市之歡喜與感激，不亞於日前在無綫電中聆聽東條首相聲明時之愉快情况。觀全市緬人咸喜形於色，行人亦彼此拍肩握手，互道慶賀，蓋緬甸處於英國勢力下未及夢想之獨立，今在日軍進駐後僅經一年餘則吿實行，其愉快自可想像也。民衆均手持孔雀旗，絡續參拜塔寺，祈禱幸福之前途，並宜誓貫澈獨立戰爭之願望。</p>
<p>巴莫委長發表演詞</p>
<p>仰光九日中央社電緬甸獨立準備委員會巴莫委員長，於八日正午緬甸獨立準備委員會成立典禮時，曾發表熱烈演說，茲錄大意如次，吾人爲緬甸之指導人員，在今日之世界秩序中，正努力於創造具有特殊權利與義務之新國家，此實歷史之偉大事業。緬甸於此歷史之轉換時期，吾人所負之責任實至重且大，吾人既逢此艱難機會，必須要共同負起此重大責任，旦應牢記過去所受之苦痛，時至今日，吾人實行之時機業已來臨，若吾人失敗不僅有負後世子孫，目使緬人之現在與將來均將深感失望。目前進行中之世界戰爭，實足以決定吾人之命運，故吾人必須澈底擊滅大東亞之敵人，再吾人所應建設者，爲世界新秩序，尤其東亞新秩序與共榮圈，此等現實情勢，實不應忘却。日本勝利，吾人之獨立即可實現，日本旣尊重予吾人獨立之諾言，且純以先覺之精神，以軍事力與政治的理想拯救緬甸以及東亞，日本爲此始來緬甸，抑東亞新秩序之意義，即如日本之付與吾人爲獨立國而成爲一有主權之國家，是故吾人於相互依賴之理念下，必須努力建設亞洲，爲整個亞洲故需强化東亞各民族之組織，今日東亞各民族業巳完全誓同生共死，事實上除此以外，亦別無他途。</p>
<p>馬尼刺九日中央社電　菲島名記者賈維埃氏，頃就此次日東條首相訪菲島事發表感想謂：東條首相此次訪問菲島，實爲菲人歷史上値得誇耀之劃期偉舉，其大意謂·「菲律濱之黎明巳屆，菲律濱現正以東亞之一環及世界民族之一之立塲，毅然奮起，爭取獨立。回憶吾菲人於過去之長時期內，始終呻吟於歐美帝國主義壓迫之下，爲其奴隸，然時至今日，世界最强之日本，其首相惠然來訪，吾人實巳獲得東亞新秩序同盟國之光榮立塲矣，且被視爲協力建設東亞之一員矣。菲島於過去三世紀間受西班牙統治，近四十年內則爲美國所支配，固然其時吾人亦曾有代表參與政治，但彼等僅知岌岌於私利之獲得，而不惜向美國搖尾乞憐，更不知爲民衆謀取福利，當菲島陷於此等慘境時，幸蒙强力之日本拯余人於水火之中，因此當東條首相蒞臨訪問時，馬尼刺市四十萬羣衆　集魯內達公園舉行盛大之感謝大會，實爲必然之現象。東條首相並於大會中闡明日本對於吾人所採取之政策，並將提高吾人所希望之地位，吾人實深感荷，凍條首相並於閉會後步入興高采烈之菲人羣衆中，向羣衆含笑爲禮，情緖至爲懇摯，民衆對此莫不感謝。過去數世紀間，余人均處於殖民地地位，爲歐美列强視爲奴隸，更感於所謂」及「民主主義」欺騙，吾人於以往對於以最大誠意拯救吾人者，亦會以懷疑之眼光吾人對於任何態度，均必立予酬答，卽對於以友好待我者，吾人必立即衷心以相報。於此世界情勢重大動盪之秋，而許以將儘速承認吾人獨立，徵諸以往西班牙及美國壓，此事實爲吾人想像所未及，吾人對此誓以忠誠信賴相報，吾人始終銘記伐爾加斯長「日本能獲勝利，吾人始得自由，吾人於日本指導之下，以自由獨立民族之立塲，努則吾人之運命定可展開。」</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　國府最高顧問石渡莊太郞氏，前爲視察上海方面最近經濟狀况，特於六日去滬，七日午後曾於旅邸接見記者，並就各記者所提出之金融通貨物價食糧各問題，答覆記者之質問。談話內容大致如下：（一）金融通貨自從停發新軍票後，軍票與儲備券一體元之調整，已能依照預定計劃順利進行，目前最重要之事，厥爲如何穩定幣値，克定物價，一方爲加强當地生產力，對於穩定之手段，亦應有寓全之措置。現計劃者，爲有獎儲蓄獎券，及發行糧食庫券彩蔡等，同時甚希望有力華商銀行，能於各地設置分支行，以期吸收內地之資金。又關於轉換遊資生產方面亦極爲重要，故對於中小型銀行之整理，國府不能不充分考慮。（二）物價問題，於戰時下，任何國家對於處理物價，均爲重大間題。最切要之方法，卽爲能以化强交流物質以抑低物價，尤其食糧價格，影響物資價格之處甚大。本年華中方面小麥收穫甚豐，同時由於日本方面之幹旋，輸入上海之南洋食米，亦爲數不少，亟應乘此機會，將食糧價格仰低。如能一面豐收，又無囤積情事發生，則華中華北之物資交流，必漸呈圓滑，關於供給華北物資，當然亦應考慮及華中之需要。（三）蒐買配給機構，全國商業統制總會籌備以來，亟於內部組織與機構結成，該會之運營，不僅須努力消除過去自由主義之方向，且須實現消除過去自由主義之方向，並努力依照國體完遂戰爭，邁入統制經濟之途，始可因此物價統制，斷然繼續執行，對生產之預算，尤應顧及，不使發生生產能率低下情事始可。至於囤積問題，當然應取斷然處分之措置爲宜，要之一切應以不離開完遂大東亞戰爭，建設共榮圈爲主張，尤其應共同協力以完成國家之目的。</p>

<p>日軍報導部長談話</p>
<p>廣州九日中央社電日華南派遣軍報道部長，於本日下午五時發表談話，大意謂：駐渝美空軍，曾於八日空襲廣州，向市內各處盲目轟炸，此種行爲實至殘暴，經日機邀擊後，即倉皇遁走。敵機此次暴行，輿前次轟炸廣州灣，均足以表示其受渝方責難後之焦慮情形，尤以彼等竟以和平區民衆爲對象，企圖擾亂而攻擊繁華街衢，並以機槍掃射殺傷無辜民衆。如此惡劣舉動，均爲國際法及人道上所不容，此實足爲美人殘酷本性之左證，日方對此定將以果敢勇鬥之精神，以覆滅此等毫無人道之美空軍。中國和平地區民衆，對此亦無不一致憤激，誓將復仇，今後敵方類此舉動，或將繼續發生，中日兩國國民，亦必將益加團結，準備防空以滅暴敵。</p>

<h3>建設經濟上海　完成中日其興</h3>
<p>— 武內文彬</p>
<p>（一）從日本方面的統制移轉到中國方面的統制。</p>
<p>（二）從官廳統制轉變到事業者自治的統制。</p>
<p>（三）取消日本商社的特權，確立中日平等制。</p>
<p>（四）脫離一地的經濟割據制，全中國鏗濟實現爲一個單位，以爲經濟上海的後台。</p>
<p>這是多麽偉大的本質上的變化啊！這新政策的發表，引起中日實業界人士的注目。不過我們應該記住，這中國經濟上日本方面之拋棄其主動性與廢棄日本商社的特權，並不是由於中國方面之積極的收回利權政策的結果，乃是日方從大處着想，「由中國人從事中國經濟的復興建設」，所以自動的加以拋棄。並且中國的經濟是中國本來面目的經濟之復興與發揮，而中日經濟合作目標的完成，又必須是理想的一致，利害的歸一，與能率的發揚始能達到，斷不是行使權力，保持並濫用特權所能成就。這是檢討事實後所得到的實踐的結論。</p>
<p>新經濟轉變的原由與指導理念，大概可以解釋如上。其次引起的問題是實行新經濟政策的成果如何？這現在尙不脫於準備時代，新經濟政策的如何實踐，如何運營，、實爲新政策功罪的分歧點。關於運用方針，我倣「以子之矛，攻子之盾」的故智，我們試研究重慶政權的行政院長孔祥熙在「生產會議」的訓示中所述的經濟進行方針。孔祥熙在民國二十八年的生產會議上强調戰時經濟中生產的重要性，他所說的經濟的進行方針有四：（一）要無廢人，（二）要無廢物，（三）要講經濟，（四）要適時機。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>所謂「要講經濟」，就是要在統制經濟，計劃經濟上運用經濟原理，發揚經濟性之謂。過去六年來的現地經濟，在統制經濟，劃計經濟上，被「政治支配經濟」的形式眩惑，與經濟原理背道而馳，故遭意料之外的失敗。統制經濟，計劃經濟的非經濟性之缺陷，實在祗要充分活用經濟原理，就能補其缺陷的。况値此決戰年頭，活用經濟原理是更有必要的了。</p>
<p>「要適時機」，這就是强調在戰時經濟的「時」的要素，假使不適時機，不能隨機應變，難免有失之交臂之憾。</p>
<p>以上的原則，必須根據全部經濟的綜合性而引導前進，使全部經濟能作有組織的活動。目下現地的經濟狀况，特別需要如此，同時要知道到了這個地步，才會實現轉換外交的眞理。</p>
<p>這裏再補充一句話，我上次和南京政府某部長懇談時，偶然談及物價問題，我當時就這樣說：今日上海的物價問題，在大學裏所學習的經濟原論：（一）物資需給，（二）通貨論，還不够用以說明今日的物價騰貴，也不是還有一部份人所說，（三）爲了世界戰局不安，這實在是：「中國無經濟現狀」所產生的。所以中日兩國政府在閣議或國務會議上，必須確認此事實，正本淸源，以造成復興建設上海生產，支配全中國經濟的「經濟上海」。如不做到這一步，則中國經濟的復與建設，中國經濟的單位化，都沒有希望，轉換外交的眞正目的，也不能達到了。</p>
<p>最後不得不獻一言者，關於「經濟上海」建設，有悲觀論存在。他們說：從來的上海經濟，依靠着貿易。然而現在此項貿易杜絕，而且不容易恢復，所以「經消上海的建設」極不容易。現在祇有上海是否可用存貨來延長經濟壽命的問題。上面這種悲觀論，毌庸詳細駁正。但是，我對於這些悲觀者的謬見，略有須予指摘者：（一）他們不能體會「敵人封鎖我經濟，便是我經濟復興的機會」的妙用，同時（二）祗知從來的上海經濟依靠貿易，誤斷中國沒有自給自足的力量，以爲中國的不能脫却貿易依存之次殖民地性格，是因爲受了協定關稅制及不平等條約的國際桎梏所致。所以中國不得不做列國的投資國，而且是國際的留易市塲，因之而阻碍了開發產業。</p>
<p>這次轉換外交，經濟的目的，就是「經濟上海」的建設，斷不容建設在他處。唯有「經濟上海」的確立，才是中國經濟復興建設與安定中國民生之本，而且是把握民心而維繫中日的永久基礎，更爲完成大東亞戰爭的樞紐，進而爲重慶降服，中國一統的大道，「聰明不如識勢」，唯有此次之大轉換，方爲對於中日同興之啟示，亦即創造一統大勢的良機。願中日軍政人民適應此啟示，勇往直前，建設「經濟上海」，完成「中日同興」。（書於天長佳節之午後）（鵬翔，譯自五月六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>羅馬軍部發表文告　義對戰局意志堅強　爲紀念突尼斯比塞大陷落改帝國日爲在非洲權利日</h3>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　義軍司令部八日就突尼斯及比塞大兩港失守事，發表文告稱：軸心軍之撤退突尼西亞，巳早在國民之預料中，反軸心軍武器與人力，均較軸心軍充足，的爲十與一之比，故其獲勝乃屬當然。但吾人對戰局前途毫無悲觀，意志仍極堅强，義軍過去曾死守該地，重創敵軍，而支待至五月之久，實爲軸心軍在軍事上之莫大成功，反軸心軍猛攻該地，爲時已久，而終未收穫何種可觀之成績。就軸心軍而言，若突尼西亞戰爭繼續進行，則自應以船舶越西西里海峽，運輸大批軍火，但以航運甚艱，損害必板重大，今旣將突尼西亞放棄，則可將其船舶調爲他用，故此次之撤退，洵屬上策。至反軸心軍欲完成其目的，仍須相當時日，彼等在北非登陸時，雖極順利，而其作戰之緩慢，實巳錯過貴重之時機矣</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　五月九日原爲義大利帝國日及海外義僑日，本年則作爲「義大利在非洲之權利」日，以紀念突尼斯及比塞大之陷落，是日之口號爲義相所云之一吾人必回非洲。」義大利報紙本日刊載論文，述義國於戰爭及和平中在殖民地之成就，並刊載圖畫，本日各城鎮皆懸掛國旗，並由敎堂舉行儀式。</p>
<p>突尼西亞沿海區軸心軍繼續抵抗</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　今晚此間接獲消息，軸心軍在突尼西亞之堅强抵抗，尙未解體，若干强大之軸心軍團，現正繼續在沿海區域堅決抵禦，仍能與另一强大軍團取得聯絡，共同利用一處根據地作戰，而與更北地區其他抵抗中心點之交通，亦未被切斷。安德森將軍所指揮之第一軍及美方第五軍，雖在東面佔領土地，惟所付代價之重大，實爲北非戰事爆發以來所未有，現在戰事已發展至短距離接戰之程度，坦克對坦克，大砲對大砲，而步兵對步兵焉，有軸心軍高射砲位一處，會在瑪特爾東部擊毀英美坦克車不下五十四輛之多，又軸心軍遇有因缺乏燃料，致未能將大砲運回後方時，即自行炸毀，俟敵軍迫近，即以白刃相加，敵坦克車七輛又被手榴彈所毀。</p>
<p>瑞士京城伯倫八日中央社電　德·義軍與人力及配備皆大爲優越之敵軍作戰，初時曾自北非戰綫之北段及中段反擊向突尼斯及比塞大進攻之反軸心軍。該兩處根據地爲反軸心軍突破佔領後，軸心軍固受嚴重之打擊，但仍反擊，軸心軍已被截分爲數處孤立之抵抗。據柏林消息，有數部主力部隊，在海岸地區及柴格霍安至恩斐達維爾地區作戰，稍北方面，又有軸心軍一隊與英第八軍相抗，各處地區皆有猛烈烈肉搏戰，英美軍使用大量之坦克車隊及千百之戰鬥機及轟炸機，逐步將軸心軍迫退。在瑪特爾之東，軸心高射砲一隊曾在至少有坦克車一百二十輛之反軸心坦克車隊中擊毀其五十四輛，其後又擊毀七架，各地區之戰鬥中，皆有此種英勇之抵抗，但羅馬及柏林方面並不過於希望軸心軍作長時間之抵抗。據路透社消息，英第一軍係於星期五在聖西普里安平原集中坦克車四百餘輛，向長僅九哩之戰綫進攻，軸心軍即退至第二綫抵抗，反軸心之空軍爲陸地部隊開路進入突尼斯之後，現巳轉向海面活動，冀圖破壞軸心航務。</p>
<h3>突尼西亞今後軍事　已無戰術重要性</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社軍事評論專家色爾托留斯今晚宣稱：突尼西亞仍在繼續劇戰中，但此次戰鬥之結果，巳不復有疑問，在原則上言之，戰鬥之結果如何，實早巳決定。反軸心軍在北非戰塲有大量之資源及物力，故自始即極有克服德·義軍橋頭堡之可能，至英·美軍在地中海區域除其原有之海軍優勢外，又獲得空軍之優勢時，則此項可能性又成爲必然性，故自此以後，敵軍又在阿爾及摩洛哥登　，在北非作戰之軸心軍，遂漸難獲得必要之供應及充分之增援。因此雙方實力比較之懸殊，每月加甚，其後竟至自西西里至突尼西亞之海上及空中交通，由於敵軍在海·空兩方面佔優勢，而低落至無足重要之程度。在此情形之下，軸心軍仍能支持達六個月之久，則軸心軍將士可謂已獲得其最大之成就矣·關於敵人方面，吾人亦承認英軍之步兵及坦克車隊之大部份，（與較爲平庸之美軍相比），會有優良之戰鬥，英軍之將官方面，雖不能有傑出之戰績，但至少在此次戰事開始以後，曾獲得不少關於戰術上之敎訓，如使用大量之坦克車，設置集中之地點及與空軍協力等，但凡此種戰術，如在軸心領袖方面能維持其一對二甚或一對三之實力比例，則敵軍亦甚難得逞。但事實上軸心軍係以一敵十，肉此反軸心在北非方面之成功，應完全歸功於英國之海軍及空軍，突尼斯及比塞大被佔領後，則英·美不必再費心思於作戰問題，可完全佔領北非軸心橋頭堡之其餘部份，但亦不能因此而獲得任何軍國上之光榮。德·義軍巳失去其全部防綫之主要根據地，此外復被分裂爲數處抵抗中心，又因敵軍在海·空兩方面之絕對優越，或完全不能維持其軍火及糧食之供應，自今以後，敵軍之海·空軍將更有效力，此輩抗戰之德·義部隊，現仍勇敢作戰，決心給敵人以最要大之損失，以至最後一刻爲止。彼等必能如願以償，但彼等遲早必爲大量之敵軍壓力所屈服，英·美將如何完成此舉，巳無足注意，此後突境之戰事，巳無戰術上之重要性，此後所能施用之方略，僅爲精神上的，吾人可確保，德軍之作戰精神，必將光芒照耀，以證明其英雄氣概·</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　此間有資格方面，昨日經由斯蒂芬尼社宜布，大爲優越之英·美軍，數月來冀圖結束北非戰事，遭德·義軍奮勇抵抗，在準備階段中及向軸心要塞攻擊時省蒙受極重大之損失，結果卒能進入突尼斯及比塞大，但在比塞大之東及沿戰綫之中段及南段，抗戰仍在繼續中，該處之軸心軍英勇反抗數目上大爲優越之敵軍，凡僅計及北非最近之戰鬥而認定敵軍所獲之結果者，實屬嚴重錯誤。蓋不應遺忘此處地區之戰事係於一九四〇年六月十日開始者也，三年以來，英國雖已動員其全帝國之力量，並於去年十一月以後，又獲得美軍陸軍及空軍</p>
<h3>爭奪地中海霸權　海空軍將有大戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據倫敦消息，英國軍界雖對突境勝利大吿興奮，但深知軸心軍隊已完成一件重要戰略工作，蓋地中海巳成爲無人之地，雙方海空軍隊勢必互爭短長。倫敦方面對軸心軍將來行動猜測頗多，意見紛歧，且抱悲觀者亦大有人在。標準夜報所謂地中海屬於我有之說，巳不復爲大衆所擁戴，英著名海軍專家文生氏指謂，軸心與反軸心海空軍，將在地中海血戰一番，以奪取覇權，彼謂西西里與撤丁旣爲軸心軍所有，反軸心海道航行危險異常，過去許多反軸心護航艦企圖衝至馬爾他島而遭殲滅，可爲殷鑒。之協助，亦未　獲得有決定性之勝利，敵軍以三軍　衆，有精强之空軍充分協助，仍遭英勇之德·義軍嚴重抗戰。軸心軍之抵抗，歷時較之敵方所預期者爲久，故德·義軍指揮部得採必要之對抗方策，因此就整個戰爭而論，比塞大及突尼斯之陷落，對於軸心之軍事局勢並無震動。若對於地中海之戰局加以研究，則可見英·美軍所控制者爲南部，軸心軍所按制者爲北部，後者有長久之時間，以組織其陣地。</p>
<h3>北非軍事變化　並不影響政治</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　自北非戰局急見轉變後，反軸心國對此乃頻行宣傳稱，此後之國際政治情勢將生新變化、　外交當局八日反駁此說，並　明其見解如次，北非之軍事情勢變化，不能引起何種政治影響，突尼斯之局部戰况如何，更不能使軸心國最後勝利發生何等障碍，對此義首相墨索里尼於五日舉行之演說，實極剴切得當。</p>
<h3>東綫氣候恢復正常　陸空激戰再展開　亞速夫海蘇軍登陸未成唐納資中流德奪回陣地</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德廳新聞社東綫訪員漢馬於八日報告東綫現況稱：東綫氣候業巳正常，土地亦吿乾燥，故各地戰鬥以及空戰再吿激烈。蘇軍爲防備來日戰爭之發展，乃屢在庫班地區及唐納資伏爾加中部各地竭力强化陣地，等增强坦克車部隊，七日一日間，蘇軍被德軍擊燬坦克車五十一輛，幷損失飛機一百另六架，故七日可謂蘇軍之最不幸日。蘇軍曾在全綫發動攻勢，企圖德軍戰力减少，但卒未得逞，庫班地區蘇軍亦曾發動攻勢，但巳被德軍擊還，損失坦克車三十輛，被俘七百四十人。德機于空戰中擊落蘇軍突擊戰鬥機六架，又德軍高射砲擊落蘇機十五架，德機於飛往亞速海海岸上空時，發現蘇軍企圖登陸，當即加以轟炸，炸沉其滿載兵員之舟艇十六艘，幷使其二十八艘受重創。唐納資河中流地區之蘇軍，曾於砲隊掩護下渡河，衝至西岸，德軍當即縮短戰綫，集中主力，實行猛攻，將其擊退，奪回原失陣地，是役蘇軍被俘二百六十三人。又蘇軍曾以達格拉斯式轟炸機十七架轟炸德軍陣地，德戰鬥機四架起飛迎戰，當即擊落其十四架。奧萊爾南方，蘇軍曾以有力部隊企圖攻據德軍陣地，但被德軍擊退，是役德軍擊毀蘇軍坦克車九輛，蘇軍被俘數百人，奪獲輕重火器無算，擊落蘇機三十六架，維里基魯基西方，蘇軍亦會採取攻勢，但喪失坦克車十二輛，被俘二百人，等損失曲射砲十一門及大批軍火。伏爾加地區蘇軍，曾乘夜偷陣，但全被德軍殲滅。</p>
<h3>英美軍官更迭</h3>

<p>回顧從前在美國求學的時候，大　的敎授們，也像這樣列坐着，我做學生，從敎授那兒聽到種種的話。那時的塲面正是這樣，但我後來竟成了博士（笑聲），一想起這事，又覺得非常愉快。</p>
<p>山本：我們都是在野的人，儘請隨便說話，我們也是同時我們也什麼都會說。要不如此，話就沒有興趣。請不要拘泥公式，隨便談吧！</p>
<p>使中日兩國臨到這種命運，其理由之一，便是日本批評中國崇拜歐美。然而仔細想來，覺得在當時的情勢上，日本也曾經是不得不追隨歐美的。一切的對華外交，日本是不得不追踪英美之後的。這種歷史，我們很明瞭。所以這時如果日本和中國共同把英美逐出東亞，如果沒有在中間幹着離間兩國之事的妨害者，則諸位所憂慮的那樣狀態，一定會自然解決了。——我們和平同志發見了這樣的結論。</p>
<p>那末怎樣才能把英美逐出東亞呢？這只靠中國來做是不能完成的事。如果由中國來做，則只能在國內發起暴動，或是做着示威運動，例如上海的五卅事件之類而巳。要把英美遂出東亞，無論如何，若非由日本爲主，展開戰爭，則這種願望是不能達到的。這意見，我曾經在二年前，還都之後不久，民國二十九年五月，以答禮大使的資格而來貴國時，於公開演講或個人談話中，屢屢說到，尤其是提到希望有像大東亞戰爭那樣的戰爭。因此我在晋謁天皇陛下時，會經謹把「今日的東亞問題，不單是中日兩國的問題，而是蘇彝十以東的問題，」那樣的意見，上聞。又對當時參謀太部次長澤田中將閣下，也陳述了同樣的意見。對橫須賀的鎮守府　谷川司今長官閣下，我在軍艦上，也曾陳述了「一旦太平洋有事，中華民國覺悟着必欲以一切的物力，人力，貢獻於大東亞戰爭」的話。其他還有種種陳言，在我約答禮紀念冊中，記有種種的文章，但這些言論，則因與軍事有關，並未記載。這些話現在暫且不提，不過我下面所說的話，却希望諸位不要忘記。</p>
<p>那就是在精養軒蒙近衛總理大臣閣下招宴時的話。當時我在席上公開的發表了這樣的意見。即：「大東亞有二個機會，能够眞正合作，第一個機會便是在東亞危機來臨之秋，例如今日有大東亞戰爭，那樣的危機到來時，過去的怨恨便都忘掉，中日兩國打成一片，而相誓同生共死。這是第一個機會：另外一個機會。</p>
<p>今天蒙陳先生在繁忙之中，抽出這個時問給我們，這裏敬向陳先牛深深感謝。</p>
<p>現在就請陳先生來講關於交還租界和參戰前後的上海及中國的狀况。</p>
<p>陳：關於參戰問題，我想把我的意見來作一個率直的具體的陳述。</p>
<p>國民政府爲什麼參戰的呢？先就此點來作具體的說明。</p>
<p>三年前開始和平運動的時候，我、正在重慶，那時在先生發表了這樣的理想：「這回開始和平運動，其理由決不是因爲中國戰敗了，沒有辦法，把這回的事變結束，隨隨便便來解決事變，俾中國在暫時休養之後，再來做些什麼。我決不是以這樣的居心，開始和平運動而脫離重慶的。」諸位知道，兩國臨到戰爭狀態的原因，決不是起於短期間的，而是由於數十年來的不和調而陷於這樣命運的。因此，如果我們先來隨隨使便解決事變，只是一時的轉變，說不定將來還要發生這種事變。例如歐洲，就有每二十年或十年，必要反復戰爭一次的狀態。不消說，歐洲是有着許多國家的，不像東亞那樣簡單，主要的國家只有中國和日本；但這個中國和日本的對立狀態，如果繼續存在，則縱然一時結束事變，每過了二十年或十年，也必定要發生戰爭的。因此我們的工作，就是要使這種事變，永遠不再反復，所以我　硏究着怎樣能够使日本和中國都向着同樣的共通的目的而努力。</p>
<p>當時如果日本和中國決定共同目的，那便是把英美帝國主義驅出東亞，除此以外沒有別的辦法，如果兩國人都有着這樣的懷抱，則兩國便打成一片，可以達到共同目的。這道理並不是凶爲有了事變才想出來的，中華民國的國民黨在民國十三年改組時，早巳有了這種口號。然而其後所以沒有達到這種目的，是因爲蔣介石和英美勾結起來的緣故。</p>
<p>例如日本和中國成立和平之後，在我們東方，必須創立一個東方國際機構——像西洋的國際聯盟那樣，使大東亞成爲一體，否則眞正的合作，將來無從實現。</p>
<p>爲什麽要說這樣的話呢？那是因爲我想到縱令一時成立了糊裏糊塗的和平，如果英美的妨害，挑撥從外加入，則特地成立的和平，就難免被破壞，所以無論如何非把妨害者　和平的毒癌除去不可。這是謀所以永遠和平之道的。今日果然這樣的大東亞戰爭，在貴國指導之下展開了，中國當然非實現我所說過的參戰，而貢齡其一切的人力物力不可，此點，我的宿願，夙望，得以實現，所又我感覺得非常愉快。</p>
<p>前年十二月八日，貴國對英美宣戰，有着堂堂的官戰布吿。此時，一窺日本的懷抱，則見日本方面，表示着由日本來負大東亞戰爭責任，日本能够獨力負担，無須累及中國。國民政府幹部諸人，得到日本這樣親切好意，立刻表示了參戰希望，好容易到了今年一月九日，才實現了參戰。</p>
<p>當時，在大東亞戰爭展開，汪主席立即聲明了和日本同甘共苦。那時爲什麽不說同生共死呢？這是因爲參戰的時機還未到來之故，所以無論如何必須同甘共苦。這次參戰實現，於是便進入了同生共死的境地。日本方面固然是發揮武士道精神，獨當其任，不欲累君，但在中國方面，則以爲在友誼上固不說，從東亞的大局想來，已不能有所愛惜，應把一切貢獻於大東亞戰爭，因爲救東亞，即所以救中國。以上是得答中國爲什麽參戰之問的。</p>
<p>其次來報吿參戰後的實際情况。</p>
<p>第一，就是參戰後民心的一變。在參戰以前，關於物資在種種上不免有消極的情緒。然而由於這次國民政府的參戰，人民的心理爲之一變，咸認大東亞戰爭是我們的事情，參加大東亞戰爭，不但是東亞一員當然任務，也是東西一員的名譽。因此心理上都一變而認爲應該自動的爲自己而拿出物資來。</p>
<p>又國民政府的參戰，決不是只發自國民政府的幹部，而是徵諸全國經濟界，金融界，以及各階級的意見結果的‘當時全國興論沸騰，異口同聲，成欲由大東亞戰爭而排除英美，認爲參加大東亞戰爭是當然的事。現在把迄於目前的民心變化狀態，報吿於下。</p>
<p>參戰後，蒙貴國確立種種偉大的政策的轉換，因此民心更加歸趨於南京政府。特別是前月（三月）十六日物資的統制問題得吿解決·諸位知道，以前物資是零零碎碎流通於甲·乙·丙·丁各地的，所以血液沒有循環，但從這次物資統制的新政策施行以來，各中心地的物資，巳能源源向上海集中了。當然，以前物價是品騰着的，然而現在物價也漸漸低下來了，民衆的生活現出安樂歡欣的狀態。在上海舉例來說，上海的各工廠，在以前生產一點不能着手，爲什麽呢？因爲工廠所製造鐫來的種種物品，由於物資的統制，什麽地方都不能運出去，因此工廠沒有利益可獲，工廠的自身就不能站立。然而自從這次新物資統制政策施行以來，各工廠都恢復了。不但如此，生產的增加也能實現了。最近由中央儲備銀行放出五億元資金，供各工廠的恢復事業和增加生產事棄之用，這樣的最近的好消息，傳給諸位，我想諸位一定都會覺得歡喜的。</p>
<p>關於參戰問題，就只說到這裏爲止，現在來聽諸位關於其次的話。</p>

<h3>剪建午　昨晚廣播　反英美會之請</h3>
<p>中華民族反英美協會於昨日下午九時半至十時，特請中央社會部副部長翦建午氏假本市上海電台廣播演講，題目爲「從反英美工作說到大東亞戰爭」，對反英美工作之意義，及與大東亞戰爭之關係，闡述頗爲詳盡，演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>演詞</p>
<p>諸位同胞：今天我的講題是「從反英美工作說到大東亞戰爭」，因反英美工作與大東亞戰爭有着密切的關係，大東亞戰爭可以說是反英美工作之實踐，而反英美工作，亦必須在大東亞戰爭的勝利保證之下，才可以完成其使命，所以把反英美工作的意義與大東亞戰爭的聯繫性作一簡要的申說。</p>
<p>我們知道反英美工作的意義並非是狹義的排外性質，而是含有被壓迫民族的革命的意義的，英美兩個國家是世界上殖民地最多而侵略歷史也最爲悠久或巧妙的帝國主義者，從菲洲到歐洲從歐洲到亞洲，到處可以看到他們的侵略事蹟，美國的侵略歷史雖較英國爲落伍，但其侵略的方式則是勝過於英國的，中國百年來受帝國主義者侵略，以致淪於次殖民地的地位，我們溯追歷史，罪魁禍首是英國，而變本加厲則是美國，此不特在中國爲然，即在東亞各民族而言，亦無不爲然，所以在近百年來的中國史，可以說是英美帝國主義者的侵略史，二三百年來的東亞史，可以說是英美帝國主義的殖民史，十八世紀以來的世界史，可以說是英美帝國主義者的猖獗史，故反英美工作在中國言是中華民族的革命運勤，在東亞言是東亞民族的反西方侵略運動，在世界言是整個世界被壓迫民族的反壓迫運動，反英美工作非僅中國應做的工作，而是整個東亞民族以至全世界被英美壓迫的民族所應共同努力的工作，這是第一點，各位應當首先明瞭的。</p>
<p>反英美工作旣是反英美侵略的被壓迫民族的革命工作，其非排外性質已很明顯，我們所反的是英美帝國主義者的殖民政策，英美帝國主義者的侵略主義，以及英美帝國主義者所加於我們的壓迫手段，至於英美的同情於我們的人民，我們非特無須反，甚至要携手的，英美的進步的科學，我們出非特無須反，甚至要採取的，英美的優良的文化（除侵略女化外），我們更非特無須反，甚至要接受的，所以我們的反英美，反的是英美的侵略壓迫，而不是排斥英美，這是第二點，各位應當明瞭的。</p>
<p>其次，我們談到大東亞戰爭。大東亞戰爭我們知道是整個東亞民族與英美帝國主　者的戰爭，而反英美工作，亦是整個東亞民族反抗英美帝國主義者的工作，故兩者的意義是一而二，二而一的，大東亞戰爭可以說是反英美工作之實踐，而反英美工作亦是大東亞戰爭的實際工作的一環，大東亞戰爭的最大　目的是建立東亞永久的和平，而破壞這東亞和平的是英美帝國主義者，故大東亞戰爭的對象，是英美帝國主義者，這是確切無疑的，而反英美工作之與大東亞戰爭有共同的目的與意義，也是無可諱言的。</p>
<p>我們旣已明瞭大東亞戰爭是反英美工作之實踐，我們爲貫澈反英美工作之使命，必須與友邦　力，以求取大東亞戰爭之勝利，亦必　在大東亞戰爭的勝利之下，才能　保反英美工作的成就。</p>

<h3>日本改造社長山本過滬　本報茶會歡迎　洽談時勢及紙張問題各抒胸臆賓主極愉快</h3>
<p>日本改造社社長山本實彥先生，此次，由華北來滬，本報爲表示歡迎，並介紹與上海各界晤談，特於昨日下午四時，假康樂酒樓舉行茶會，出席者計有：日高淸磨瑳·吉田東祐·朱永康·吳凱聲·尾坂與市·周化人·周越然·周黎庵·李權時·岩井英一·兒島博·柳雨生·夏劍丞·陳日平·陸高誼·陶亢德·張一鵬·張雪濤·葉穗銘·聞蘭亭·楊迴浪·楊光政·趙正平·趙晋卿·鄭鴻彥·蔣雲章·潘仰堯·潘予且·潘柳黛·及木報記者等數十人。（以姓氏筆劃爲序）。</p>
<p>陳社長詞</p>
<p>首由本報陳社長致簡短歡迎詞，略謂：山本先生爲友邦日本著名之評論家，思想家及出版界碩彥，「改造」月刋尤爲日本雜誌中銷數最多而內容最完善之一種。今年爲改造社二十五周年紀念，山本先生特旅行來華，考察參戰以後之中國情勢，山本先生三十年來爲最關心遠東問題的「中國之友」且促進中日兩國之親善最力，今日介紹與諸君晤談，座中不少爲山本先生之舊友，想彼此必感愉快，我們更慶祝改造社前途發展無量，並祝山本先生健康。</p>
<p>山本致詞</p>
<p>繼由山本（社長）致辭云：本人來華，巳非初次，余對貴國素抱愛慕之心，今日承陳社畏之招待，得興在座諸君暢談，深爲欣幸。中日之團結協力</p>
<p>團結協力</p>
<p>，其必要非始於今日，尤以大東亞戰爭以遝，更有進一步結合之必要。此次本人來到貴國後，目睹各項設施之進展，殊爲愉快，但劉於政治方面，並不以此爲滿足，希望再接再厲，作更進一步之努力，此種希望，諒不止余個人，相信貴國人士，亦必力求進步。我日本發動大東亞戰爭後，無日不在厲精圖治，軍事上之發展，戰局上之有利，固不必論，即政治方面，亦隨戰局之進展而步步改進，貴國參戰以後，分担大局之使命愈重，甚盼不斷努力，繼續前進。况値</p>
<p>歐戰緊張</p>
<p>之際，德蘇戰局方興未艾，上次史太林城一役，尤足使人注目，相信中國人士亦未忽視此點·今後德蘇戰爭之發展，想諸君必茜注意，按德蘇兩國皆爲陸軍國，各具優勢，在勢力均等之國家欲分成敗，必有一番惡戰，我人更不得不密切注視。値此多事之秋，中國應付內外問題匪易，對外應付，必先有健全强力之政治，獲得人民擁護，爲强化政治力之前提，如何獲得人民擁護，則惟有努力修明政治，此點達到後，不特一方之人民悅服，即渝方統治下之人民，亦必欣然來歸，余相信此點有做到之必要，更確信必能做到。最後，願以從業文化界三十年之關係，略述文化事業之根本的</p>
<p>紙張問題</p>
<p>日本之製紙能力，與戰前並無若何相差，然則日本之出版事業報章雜誌等，何以欲緊縮篇幅，蓋因處此長期戰爭，不得不在事先有一準備，俾文化戰之工具（紙）可用之不盡，取之不竭，與長期戰爭併進，粉碎敵人紙上謠言攻勢云。</p>
<p>柳雨生詞</p>
<p>余並非今日初　山本先生，而回憶半年前初瞻丰采之際，亦恍如舊識，因山本先生爲中國之老友，深諳中國各方面情况，嘗恨不得中國爲其故鄕，吾人皆熟知彼爲日本出版界文化界權威，所主持之「改造」爲世界著名之雜誌，其時局評論著述以及旅行見聞錄，壓爲吾國讀者所歡迎。因山本先生爲一眞實瞭解中國，同情中國人民之思想家，故鄙人以爲吾人除飽聆彼高論外，更應開誠布公，披瀝見解，互訴衷腸。以政治觀點言之，日本與中國之前途爲同生共死，方進行聯合世界以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥之戰爭，以文化及思想觀點衡之，則中日兩國協力提携，尙有待於各種合作事業之積極建股，努力邁進。思想爲一切動力之泉源，山本先生不但爲日本思想界之倡導者，又爲時局之銳利觀察者，其見地自然高人一等。鄙人至盼山本先生此次遠來，能多所勾留，俾能儘量觀察體騐中國各方面之情况及動態，則獲益者將不止於中國人民，而整僩東亞及世界大局之前途幸福，實利賴之。</p>

<p>在前次出席東亞文學代表大會時，得識山本先生，今日重逢故交，實深愉快，回憶上次晤山本先生時，余曾言：聞英美爲對渝作空虛示惠起見，將有撤廢治外法權，放棄租界之舉，以圖欺騙渝方人民，果爾，則日本何不率先對國府實行撤廢治外法權，交還租界，英美以空言示惠，日本以事實表現，則中國人民必感日本之誠意平等待我而奮起協力，當時山本先生亦以爲然，且斷定日本政府必有此舉，不過時間問題耳。不數日，日本政府果將此事實現，至是益覺先生之識見遠大，觀察準確，吾人自審使命艱巨，願以萬分誠意接受善意批評，求得中日合作之聚固，更盼先生歸國後，將此行見聞，轉告貴國人民，以促進貴我兩國之團結。末由趙正平等致詞盡歡而散。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>地產與民生</h3>
<p>人民與土地，二者原爲不可分離的。自　個的中國民間經濟而言，中國數千年來，以農立國，大多數的人民生活，全賴土地的耕種；即以農工併論，中國至今仍未能脫離十九世紀的家庭工業制　；一般家庭所恃爲生活者，半由製造，半由耕種，換句話說，終不能脫離士地，以維生活，</p>
<p>可是，本題所指點的，並非農村中恃以爲耕種的地產，而是都市中和居住問題有關的地產，——莫如說房地產。房地產的交易，從理論上說，不可能非芷當投資的一種。觀於最近的上海，自從公認囤積物品，尤其囤積與人民日常生活有關的物品，是投機的，違法的，於是所謂游資的一部份，遂乃改途易轍，羣趨於地產的交易。</p>
<p>上而說過，地產買賣，原爲正當交易；可是，旣爲正當交易，便當切實記住一個正當原則，就是：在地產交易之中，母忘人民生計。因爲，據我們所知道的，有些經營房地產者，大約由於經營技術的高明，遂不惜（一）以拆除房屋爲買進地產的原則，因爲可從變賣磚瓦木料上，大獲其利，（二）以增加房租爲買進地產的動機，因爲地產換了新的主人，地產上的房屋，便可改訂新的租價。結果，前者直可令人無家可歸，後者亦足以令人增加生活負擔；肚外，擁有房地產者，其中甚且有人挾其錢與勢的威力，一方面分化房客中間的結合，一方面進行權勢門前的勾留，以遂其驅逐老房客，坐收新租命的欲念，置一般人的安居樂業問題於不顧。這都是要不得的，都是經營房地產交易與擁有房地產者所務須避免的不正當，不合理的行爲。總之，須要抱着「巳所勿欲，勿施於人，」的一個神聖原則，那麼，經營者自經營，生活者自生活，各不相擾，天下太平責由交行設農業經濟處辦理</p>
<h3>財實兩部爲增加生產　強化農業經濟機構　責由交行設開業經濟處辦理</h3>

<h3>消滅投機的根本對策（一）</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>物價的暴漲，原因雖多，但投機囤積，實居主要地位，尤以此次爲史甚。囤貨者不售，無貨者拚命拽購，遂致巿塲混亂，價格猛升不巳。影響所及，爲害匪淺，國府亦因而有激査之通令。澈査假使不能澈底，非但無利於物價的抑平，且將引起人民的失望，更足助長物價的漲風，是以祈望當局深切注意，公正執行，以達預期之目的。最近雖巳有一二懲罰之事，然不能認謂完成，尙須積極推進，使囤積完全不得逍遙於法網之外，繼續作祟，以達其自肥的私慾。前讀吉田東祜氏的『論物價問題的嚴重性』一文，其中指出投機囤積，具有政治性。他說：『上海仍然是與重慶展開經濟戰爭的最前綫，投機市塲爲其中心戰塲，這問題國府若能獲得勝利，則上海市民將成爲衷心的國府支持者，若失敗，則國府的將來，將有重大的後果，而且簡直是日本完遂大東亞戰爭上的大打擊。』由此可知，投機囤積問題的嚴重，已達極點，不容我人的冉爲忽視，更非速加撲滅不可。並且，投機囤積的撲滅，非但不可虎頭蛇尾，而且也不可一了了之，這就是說，對於投機囤積的撲滅，非但須求目前的澈底，尙須求永久的根本解決，不能僅求其虛，並須求其實際，使其永遠的根絕，因是，對於消滅投機之道，以根本解決爲宜。作者有鑒於斯，謹　一對策於次，以期投機囤積的根本消滅：</p>
<p>（一）明文制定取締囤積的法律。囤楨的取締，在戰時期間，決不是暫時的，而是永久的，對於囤積的取締，倘有法律的制定，以防止投機囤積於未表，前較諸阻止於已然的激査，易於收效。至於吉田東祐氏所提議。『按情節之輕重，分別處以死刑或有期徒刑』，作者完全贊同，因爲在投機囤積猖獗之時，這是必要的措置，否則不足以儆兇頑。</p>
<p>（二）在澈査之後，大規模的投機囤積者分別處以重罰之外，對於其餘囤積的貨物，可由當局發行『商品庫券』，以限價收買之。此於『吸收剩餘購買力的檢討』之一文內，業已詳論，不復贅述。總之，積存大貨的收買，是對囤積者再重的打擊，因爲國積者失去貨物的憑藉，便就難以作祟了。而且，在投機囤積猖獗之際，亦惟有　收買的辦法，方易奏效·否則，貨物仍中囤積者保持，雖有取締的法律，和澈査的舉動，但囤積者仍可利用種種取巧方法以爲規避。</p>
<p>（三）旣有全國商業統制總會，則此後對於存積貨物的收買，亦可以政府爲後盾，而由該會去辦理。在收買完成以後，宜從速確立配給制度，改造華中的經濟機構，使由過去的自由放任狀態改建爲嚴格的統制制度。各種日用品的配給，必須適合戰時的狀態。但由過去的配給之經騐上，尙有數端，官加注意：第一，配給量宜提高，以適合各個人的需要；第二，年齡的大小，對於需要數量絕不相同，所以配給量亦須加以詳細的不同的規定，以示公平；第三，勞力者和勞心者，對於消費的程度和消費的數量亦不相同，因而於配給的物資和數量，亦宜分別加以增减，以示適當。第四，對於出售配給貨品的商店，宜時加檢査，以杜舞弊情事，否則，多缺不能調整，則黑市父將冉起，黑市起，父將爲投機者造機會，且又將减弱配給制度的效力·因爲黑巿的所以產生，即由於人民需要的不能滿足。</p>
<h3>商統會將設武漢支部</h3>
<p>本對華新國策進後，武漢地區之經濟，亦有相當轉換，故派遣軍總司令部小川中佐，大使館梶原武官，福田國府經濟顧問，淸水大使館書記官，河野大藏省書記官等，於五日聯袂乘機赴漢視察金融財政狀况，五六兩日假總領事館與駐漢陸海軍及大東亞省關係者舉行懇談會，結果決定在武漢設立全國商業統制總會支部。</p>
<p>今後向歸日方統制之統制經濟機構，一切將移交於華方，刻正硏究籌備之中。並就將向國府登記之中江實業銀行問題，與華方銀行界懇談，巳於七日公畢飛返南京。（雲鵬：譯自五月九日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>主要商品登記法令在研究中</h3>
<p>根據王要商品囤積治罪條例第九條中明定，在本條例施　前，有本條例第三條情形者，應於本條例實施之日起一個月內向當地主管官署施行登記，於第三條中亦明定，主要商品公會會員違反主管署叩令或公會業規對所存商品匿不登報者，處一年以上五年以下有期徒刑，得併科三萬元以下罰金，聞現以實業部爲中心，對登記法令在研究中，一俟審査終了，即將由國府明令公佈。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>

<p>南市商會事務所，爲維護商界本身利益及充實戰時公會力量計，除已督促各該未加入同業公會之商號迅速入會外，復分函本市各同業公會索取會章，或由各該同業公會指定南市會員一家，用資就近接洽，申請加入各該同業公會。現今浙省春蠶大眠已過即將上簇，繭行開秤約二十左右，蘇省因孵育較遲約月底上市，上海無錫嘉興等處絲廠，業巳修理絲車，候春繭上市後，即行恢復開車繅絲，惟聞今春江浙兩省春繭產額，因桑地改種其他農產物，所以勢必較戰前减少。</p>
<p>新新股份有限公司，於昨日上午十時，在綠寳劇塲舉行股東會，由金宗城君主席，除報吿營業狀况外，復討論是年度盈餘分配案，計派股息八厘，紅利一分一厘決議通過，並定於五月十五日起分派。隨討論增加資本案，決議資本總額由三百五十二萬元，增至一千六百萬元，自本月十五日起開始辦理認繳股款手續。</p>

<h3>顧先生的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>下着雨，是一個陰霾的冬天，天亮了好些時候了，瀉進小屋子裏來的光綫　舊極黯淡；熟睡在屋角裏的孩子們斷斷續續在發出鼾聲，空氣中蘊含有大量的水蒸氣，還混合着脚臭，尿味以及從被褥裏散佈開來的熱氣。</p>
<p>這時候，我們的主人，顧先生剛拿出碗來，用鉛瓢向一個鍋子裏舀了兩下，才恍然發覺，那裏面原來是空空如也，他不禁微微懊惱，於是他輕輕詛咒了一句「倒霉的」！接着，像是按動了靈機，他的腦子裏湧出一些話　：「如果囤五六擔米放在家裏多好……」</p>
<p>早上不煮粥，該不是一兩天的事了，可是他總是不習慣……現在，他躊躇了半響，把一只小鐘捧起來，呈露在微弱的光綫中，已　九點十分了。還是去買點搶餅吃吃吧！</p>
<p>外面，　風正打起莫大的胡哨，人聲可更來得嘈雜，一陣陣的吶喊和了風聲搖撼着小屋子的門窗，這聲音不能不對於他有着親切之感，有着極大的魔力：他漸漸給牠攝住了靈魂，他諦聽着，分辨開，　是爭寫號碼的聲音，……接著一極大的擁擠聲，突　，小屋子的後面敞開了：連串滾進來妻潑　的罵聲。</p>
<p>「菩薩真該……」打開塗滿了紫色手印的米袋，一邊在地板上擦着鞋底「沒有傘，沒有套鞋，淋着雨，……真是前世造孽，會過這種日子！」</p>
<p>丈夫楞然望着她那雨水沾濕了，黏緊在一起的亂發，感到內心的沉重，一時可找不出話來安慰：「甚末？！」</p>
<p>「否則，他還來服侍你」！洶洶地怒火燒到他上了。</p>
<p>「　別向我發火啊！……我問你，對面那個老頭兒在不？給我去買塊搶餅吧!」他摸索着，投過去五角錢，一張破爛的票子。</p>
<p>「嗯！」這反而更扇旺了她的火「架子請不要這末大！我又不是娘姨，擠米，磨粉，煮飯……現在，連買這末一塊搶餅，也得我來，難道你的脚走不動？痛呢？還是發腫！」</p>
<p>「我說的一點不錯！」這囘他發了急，開始喃喃不淸了：「我們家裏永遠不會好，和氣才能發財！可是我們呢！一天到晚吵，一天到晚鬧……」</p>
<p>「和氣！」妻諷刺地，浮上了輕蔑的笑容：「把人家當做娘姨也是和氣！」啐了一口吐沫。</p>
<p>「……」他吱咕了一通，思索不到一句適當的話來報復，心裏卻是七上八下，翻騰着；好比茶壺裏的開水起伏着忿怒的浪濤，然而又是空空的，找不出一樣東西來，終於長嘆了一聲，他跨出了這陰暗的小屋子，——閃動着隆起的背影。</p>
<p>了後門，他又趦趄起不，外面正傾下來大雨，邊上的水溜管大聲地在滴溚。水流是急遽的，使　冲擊着。</p>
<p>「少不了一件大衣的，天這樣冷！」靠在門過上，注視着弄堂外的人行樹——高打起胡哨的西北風使勁折搖牠們，剝脫得精光的幹子，他不自主地戰抖了，並且懷念起大衣來，感慨無限……</p>
<p>那還是四個月以前的事，不知是那兒來的鬼在作崇，一個奇怪的想頭碰了他，發見了牠的知己。於是捉住了他的心，牢牢地，一直不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>「來……你說，大衣藏在箱子裏，會不會生出錢來？」一天晚上，他召喚過妻子來，兩眼裏閃爍出奇異的光來，用手指劃着桌子，問道：</p>
<p>「唔！」茫然叮住他的臉：丈夫怎會問她這末個怪問題，　大衣那會　出鈔票呢？笑話！</p>
<p>「那末，大銅鈿會不會生小銅鈿呢？」他在桌上劃了兩個圈圈，一個小的緊挨着一個大的。</p>
<p>「……」妻給他的問題愕住了。</p>
<p>「吿訴你，囤貨懂　？」於是，他開始闡發最近才編入他人生哲學裏的新理論。在慘黃的燈光下，他的嘴角上第一次掛上了微笑。雖然，這還是枯澀的笑吧，可是，那裏面炫耀着莫大的雄心和希望哩！一識時務都爲俊傑，這個年頭，　霧騰騰是不成功的了……大衣藏在箱子裏生不出錢來，可是把牠換了錢，當做本鈿，——反正銀行裏允許我們做押款——買進了貨色，囤在倉庫裏。過兩天，就生出小銅鈿來了……總之，我決定把大衣賣去！冬天要穿的時候，反正已經賺了錢，可以買一件新的了！」</p>
<p>妻子完全給他的宏論征服了，最初，她靜靜聆聽着，讓他的理論和希望在她的心田裏馳騁；繼之，她的希望也躍躍欲試，跳動起來。終于，跟着馳進了廣闊的原野：「可是，一件大衣有五六百好當，最多了，把那件大毛皮袍子也賣了吧！反正有了錢可以買的！」</p>
<p>「這末子，你得答應我！」她轉過身去，用塗滿了濕煤屑的黑手　擦擦油汗的臉，打算做煤球去，突然想起了，她認正地問：「　了錢，給我買一雙套鞋，下起雨來，那雙破皮鞋總要滲進的！」</p>
<p>「哈……」丈夫撞起桌子來，大笑了：「爲什麼買套鞋呢！拔佳　皮鞋任你　好啦！」</p>
<p>，決定下來，他將　衣和皮袍子賣給了保管科的　主任，得了一千幾百塊錢，千辛萬苦，要求經理答應了，做來二千塊押款！於是，一筒白萬士林搬進了倉庫。</p>
<p>現實是個　　的　　竹家；隨着漲風的騰起，顧先生的心田上怒放。希望的鮮花的時　，　　會爆發起什末太平洋戰爭來。一陣驚人的暴風雨洗刷了整個兒上海，也　　了那怒放著的鮮花。謠言滿街飛起，什麼銀行倉庫給抄夫了多少水銀，那是軍用品，什麼堆　又抄去了幾筒萬士林，那也是軍用品。</p>
<p>「　偏偏我們　手了，會　出這倒霉的事來，人家吃去了肚下白，我們連鴨屁股也撈不着！」顧先生於是長吁短嘆，淪入陰暗的深澗，他使出了全身的解數，擠進向來不接近的人　中，打聽消息，苦心籌劃着……</p>
<p>想到這兒，像抓住了什末有力的根　，他驀地挺直了身子，走向屋子去，後門砰然一聲，關上了，顯示着這個根據是極有力的。</p>
<p>「你是娘姨！你一天到晚喊苦！我可是什末呢？」他仵立在門口，朝着黑暗，哭喪地說：「我一天到晚像牛馬似地耕種，爲的是誰？我賣去了大衣，衹穿着一件薄薄的絲線袍子，又是爲的誰？……」</p>
<p>坐在馬桶上的妻子，欠起身子來，張大眼睛瞧着他——莫名其妙。</p>
<p>「我爲了那一筒萬士林，受了人家多少的氣……」</p>
<p>「你又是那樣了；去照照鏡子　，你的眼　已經深陷下去了，面色顯得可怕的灰敗！爲什末總是折磨自己！應該把心放得寬一點，財與命相連……」妻這囘　然換了一付口氣，提起袴子，拍着他的肩膀安慰了。</p>
<p>「財與命想連現在我們要沒有命了，一千塊向誰去調轉！」聲調轉成嗚咽。</p>
<p>「你別急，天　菩薩不會虧待好心人的，這末我囤戶，難道偏偏會揀中你？船到橋門　會直，將來自有辦法的！」妻柔聲地說，忽又想起了什末事，暼視了小鍾，嚷道：「啊呀！已經九點半啦！一定在寫號碼　，你也得到寫字間去了吧！」</p>
<p>「不……雨下得這末大，我還得等一會兒！」</p>
<p>「我看還是向隔壁阿婆借一頂傘！」妻拉着他們手臂，向外走出「我陪你到電車站，順便買些搶餅，再去擠米吧！」</p>
<p>顧先生拖着鉛重　步子走近了寫字間的門口，他握住了門把，慢慢推　着，似乎那扇門是用鐵鑄造的，需要莫大的力氣才推得開。他沒精打彩地凝視着門，掛在那上面的，「文書科」的牌子，搖幌起來，像是輕蔑地在嬉弄他，嘲笑他那坎坷的命運。</p>
<p>「我當是誰！原來是「賣了大衣的，」怎末，今天簽到簿上挨着末名了！」是范科員沉濁的粗警，他斜靠着身子，坐在寫字桌的角上，那裏聚圍着五六個人，在商談些什末鬼話。</p>
<p>「沒有什末……唔下雨」話聲　沉　像是　　。</p>
<p>「顧先生！肩上　濕了，有沒有滲透？」楊主任問道。</p>
<p>「穿　是絲棉袍子，主任先生，不會滲透的。」顧先生站定了，無論語氣，態度都是恭維的。說完了，他還　　衡着說話的分量。</p>
<p>坐入了自己的坐位，無目的地拉動抽屜，潤濕毛筆，惘然不知所措，……打了個呵欠，他躬起身子，將視綫　向窗外去：上面，灰色的天，疾遽撇落下來的雨點；路上，四五個水潭，幻滅的水泡，——怪無聊的，於是，他又萎頹在坐椅上。</p>
<p>在一　，切切絮語，還夾進了拖長的嗤笑。</p>
<p>「有眉目嗎？袁先生碰着了沒有？」保管科的吳主任　過來，站在背後問。</p>
<p>「唔！吳主任……倒開玩笑了」他囘轉過身子來，輕輕囁嚅道，那件熟悉的大衣炫　着他　眼，　　了他的心。</p>
<p>「火腿大　　了吧？他這樣答　你的。可以講給我們聽聽嗎？」　起小丑式的鬼　，　個並不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>「哈……」點着了哄堂的笑聲，……</p>
<p>人們似乎總喜歡牢記鄰人的資料，那還是兩個禮拜以前，正　傳着就要來檢查倉庫的事，同事們一堆一堆的。</p>
<p>「我有辦法，只要請我們的袁老先生過去講講斤　就行了！」顧先生壓低了嗡嗡的聲音，帶着有把握的口吻說。</p>
<p>「他肯白白給你跑？你倒打算得好。」人家不　視他的意見，吹着鼻子，歪歪嘴。</p>
<p>「送他一只金華火腿不就得啦！」揣摩了一會兒，才冒了大　說。一條金華火腿是　重的禮物了。額上滲出黃汗來。他想着：這禮物，別人會不會以爲太重了，而訕笑他，照价原來的想法，應該是送一籃橘子的。</p>
<p>「哈……爲了一筒萬士林，叫他老先生去跑一趟？把你的血本都給了他，最多也不過討個白眼！一只火腿……」笑聲波浪似地擴大着……傳染給了每一個人。</p>
<p>於今，這笑聲又高揚了！他不禁毛骨悚然！</p>
<p>「惡毒心思！」強烈的嫉憤揉亂了他的心，他又感到內心不可抑止的衝動。那一筒萬士林是他的生命，這不單單衹有幾千塊錢的價值。他無論如何得奪回那筒萬士林來，可是這將怎麼辦呢？人們是那樣的冷淡，殘酷，沒有人會來憐　這弱小的動物。叩頭哀求吧？天地永遠是那末淡淡的，淡淡的……他的世界　始在粉碎了，倒塌下來。他內心的空洞無限止地在擴張……消解了他的全身。</p>
<p>「讓我吿訴你吧！」楊主任像一個審判官屹立在前面了，「倉庫已經開封了！可是，你別激動呀！……」</p>
<p>然而，他已經陡然跳了起來。一陣戰慄！咽喉裏像是要嘔吐似的湧着，心臓要蹦出來了！</p>
<p>「開了封！真的？」</p>
<p>「你慢慢的，幾十筒黃白萬士林都搬出來了！」</p>
<p>「那末，我的呢？現在放在那裏？」</p>
<p>「現在已經撇到不知什麼地方去了，這是軍用品呀！」審判官宣　了他的判決書。</p>
<p>「……」他張圓了充滿着血的眼，瞪住對面的胖臉。他簡直辨不明從那張大嘴裏發出的聲音是什麼意思。</p>
<p>「剛才梁主任叫我通知你：來了以後，立刻就下去一次行裏限定在兩天內　清押款！」實大的手拍拍他的肩膀，又搖搖擺擺遠去了，留下站立不穩的一個……。</p>
<p>夜，雨蕭蕭地。……</p>
<p>水溜管低聲嗚咽着，寂寞的嗚咽……</p>
<p>從西北刮來的寒風馳騁在空間，重重的高樓角擦傷了牠的膀子，激起了憤怒的吼聲。</p>
<p>這些日子原衹有淚，嘆息，……淚，嘆息……</p>
<p>顧先生才從外面回來，呆立在小屋子的中間，　雙垂着鷄冠，　打敗了的公鷄。</p>
<p>「舅公怎樣說？你　什麼一聲不響！」妻停輟了　着苞米的手，問道。</p>
<p>「衹答應　千　。」掛在亂發上的水珠閃爍着，滴了下來，他任着雨水慢慢注入了歪斜的嘴裏。</p>
<p>「利息？」</p>
<p>「三分！」他恨恨吐出了這兩字來:接着他毅然地走向小床去，頓下來，拉出了箱子。翻着……</p>
<p>「怎末，你又預備去……」妻摸撫着兩件夾衣服：戀戀不捨：「不還是挺好的，春天裏我還是要穿呢！」</p>
<p>「你要不要活！」丈夫粗暴地，搶了衣服過來，「經理斬釘截鐵地說，在兩天裏不了清，一定開除！」</p>
<p>他吱唔着，去了！響起動人魂魄的腳步聲！</p>
<p>「　書……」妻暗啞的聲音。</p>
<p>「什末事？」射過來憤怒的，而又是乞求的光：「你哭些什末？」</p>
<p>「我說，我們把以後中上的「飯」也省去吧！都是兩頓和苞米的粥！這種情況……」</p>
<p>「……」默然流下淚來，可是立刻轉過身去，挾緊衣服去了！</p>
<p>妻流着淚，跟了出來；她凝視着他那　弱的，隆起的背影！——遠了！模糊了，給黑暗吞滅了！稠密的雨網遮上了她的眼簾。</p>
<p>風怒吼着，傾下來大雨，從小屋子裏傳出來孩子們的夢囈：「菩薩！菩薩在那裏？媽媽！我不高興……」</p>

<h3>詩的通俗化與方言性</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>讀了胡明揚君「　新詩的　展」篇，論及新詩之不發達，不夠通俗化是重要原因之一，這是無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>要使新詩普遍的發達，必須盡力使它的言語和文字趨於通俗化。詩歌是從大眾語言中學習陶冶得來的。過去每一個偉大的詩人，沒有不在　眾中鍛練和洗滌的。所以，一個偉大的詩人，同時也是大眾的詩人。詩歌根本是大眾的，而並不是少數學者士大夫的。所以應當走回詩的原來道路，就是把詩交給大眾，傳達大眾的「心聲」，使誰都能讀得懂，聽得懂，而終於普遍到每個　眾的角落；散佈到每個民眾的心田。</p>
<p>二十餘年來，中國的新詩曾經做些什麼工作呢？剛脫離了五言七古，就鑽進了十四行詩商籟體的也有：主張了自由詩，而立刻又進入了寫晦澀的難詩的也有。中國新詩的最大的缺點，顯示在缺乏通俗的語言和文字，而變得那末難懂，使人害怕，或者那末壞，使每一個人不歡喜。就是沒有肯大膽的，率直的，坦白的應用通俗的語言。而爲了風雅的習氣猶存，就得到玩弄字　的結果。這是中國新詩的一個最大的毛病。</p>
<p>俄國詩人普希金，對於本國文學的最大貢獻，是在詩中採用俄國人民的粗俗的語言。這最粗俗的語言，經過詩人的選擇錄用之後，變成了更精練的語言，而每一個人民，對於這種語言所寫的詩，感到了深切的趣味和印象。就因爲這一點功績，他成爲俄國的文學之父。文藝復興時代的詩人們也是這樣的，詩人屈原也同樣的用地方語來寫詩。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰曾說：他聽音樂院的演奏總是不能滿意，可是偶然一次聽到農夫唱着民　經過他的窗子，使他感動極了，高爾基亦曾寫過同樣的經騐。每一個藝術部門，都是向民眾取得材料來豐富它自己的，尤其是音樂和詩。音樂取的是樂句，而詩取的是語言。美麗而精練並能作爲詩的語言的唯有方言。字音的響亮，內容的刻劃之深，是地方語所特具有的。往往我們聽見一句地方語的話句，立刻會感到一種立體的透明的力量。但是，許多詩人卻把這輕輕地忽略了。</p>
<p>提倡方言詩可使中國的新詩普遍到每一個角落。詩的朗誦是使詩走上正確的道路的唯一的方法。可是，這朗誦的必須是方言詩，否則就不能使每人聽了都懂。這就失去了朗誦的意義。所以，我們不單不能怕詩寫得通俗，容易懂，而且不怕被譯成俚俗的方言。澈底的展開方言詩，地方語的詩，直到由於交流地產生一個全國性的普通話的時候，這時候，詩人所寫的詩，中國的新詩，便能這更廣大的讀者所接受。</p>
<p>所以，我們先要把國語詩譯成方言詩，譯成上海話，南京話，廣東話，天津話，湖南話，客家話等各地方的　方語詩。不但要把國語詩譯成方言詩，並且要澈底的應用了地方語，混進人中間去記錄地方語，選擇那些精練的語言，寫下來作成一首好詩。我們不希望做一個詩的創造者，但求能夠做一個詩的記錄者。那是說，沒有一個詩人敢說他能創造，他只僅是記錄而已。而從另一方面看來，經過詩人的頭腦選擇下而後記錄的語言的詩，也就是詩人的偉大的創造啊！</p>

<h3>How to Practice the New Political Morality</h3>
<p>"Refreshing politics" and "rectifying politics" are the urgent demands of the people to the government today. The purpose of these demands is undoubtedly to establish a strong government to undertake the task of national rejuvenation. To this end, we have repeatedly elaborated on the way to national prosperity and decline, in order to seek correction from the authorities. Mr. Yoshida, a person from a friendly country, has also written articles on this issue (published in this newspaper on May 7th). His conclusion, based on the characteristics and actual needs of Chinese society, proposes the establishment of "new morality." New morality refers to what the general public should possess in common. We believe that while the general public must establish new morality, the government must first practice the new political morality as a guide for the public to practice the new morality.</p>
<p>What is "new political morality"? In short, with the aim of relieving the people's suffering and reviving the country, establish a political creed suitable for the current political environment, and start with the government itself. Here, we put forward three principles for discussion:</p>
<p>First, is "The world belongs to all." The country is owned by all the people. Therefore, all political measures taken by those in power should be entirely based on the interests of the people. "When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all." Currently, we are already the "Republic of China," a country owned by all Chinese people, and absolutely not a country privately owned by a few people or a political party. Mr. Sun, the founder of the Kuomintang, also earnestly regarded "The world belongs to all" as the highest goal of the Three Principles of the People. "Ruling the country by the party" means using ideology to win people's hearts; that is, "convincing people with virtue" and seeking benefits for the people. To thoroughly demonstrate the spirit of "The world belongs to all," the government must first achieve "appointing people based on talent," and not "appointing people based on personal interests," "family ties," or "hometown connections." For example, Chiang Kai-shek treated the country as his personal property, employing incompetent and corrupt individuals like H.H. Kung, who occupied important positions for a long time. Kung's children, still immature, held prominent positions in the financial world. This kind of appointment based on personal interests and family ties due to "nepotism," regarding the "country" and the "party" as private property, ultimately evolved into political darkness, popular resentment, and confinement to China's "Kamchatka." We must take this as a warning and vigorously advocate "appointing people based on talent." Secondly, those in power should have the demeanor of great statesmen, and should not think that those who agree with me are all right, and those who oppose me are all wrong. They should value criticisms from public opinion with a humble attitude, and must have the tolerance to accept them. If they do not ask right from wrong, but simply regard opponents and critics as enemies and try to get rid of them quickly, this will be an obstacle to blocking political rectitude. In short, everything for the public is the first point that the new political morality should put into practice.</p>
<p>Second, is "Respecting public opinion." Public opinion is the common will of the people, that is, the common demands of the people. This will, this demand, is often reflected in public opinion. The government must not make policies or implement decrees based on the subjective opinions of a few people, closing the door and building a cart, but must listen to the people's opinions and extensively solicit public opinion before and after, in order to make timely and appropriate revisions, especially for the benefit of the majority of the people. For example, the elimination of hoarding and speculation, opium smoking, gambling, and officials engaging in business, etc., is beneficial to the majority of the people. Therefore, in implementing such policies, we must act swiftly and decisively, and persevere to the end. These things that are beneficial to the majority of the people are the common will and common demands of the people, and the government must respect and comply with them. This is the second point that the new political morality should put into practice.</p>
<p>Third, is "Clear rewards and punishments." This is an important factor in promoting administrative efficiency. If those who have merit and labor are not given appropriate rewards, there will be no way to encourage progress; if those who are self-serving and derelict in their duties are not given appropriate punishments, there will be no way to warn the cunning and stubborn. Without clear rewards and punishments, the political apparatus will become a chaotic world without right and wrong, causing the capable to be buried and sighing in depression; the cunning to speculate and become arrogant; and the stubborn and foolish to occupy positions and be complacent. In personnel matters, talent and incompetence will be disordered and reversed, resulting in a decadent atmosphere and the exposure of ugliness. Confucius said: "If the name is not correct, the words will not be smooth; if the words are not smooth, the affairs will not be accomplished; if the affairs are not accomplished, the rituals and music will not flourish; if the rituals and music do not flourish, the punishments will not be appropriate; if the punishments are not appropriate, the people will not know what to do." It is precisely because right and wrong are unclear today, and rewards and punishments are not distinct, that politics has no right path and society has no public opinion; however, to seek clear rewards and punishments, it is not about formulating detailed regulations and making pleasant speeches, but about never being partial and breaking through personal connections. If those who should be punished have even more background, then they should be punished even more severely. In that case, the effect will be like the wind blowing on the grass, and the social perception will be refreshed, and political rectitude will begin from this. This is the third point that the new political morality should put into practice.</p>
<p>"The world belongs to all," "respecting public opinion," and "clear rewards and punishments" are the prerequisites for new political morality. Further, it lies in the spirit of practice, which is the so-called "trustworthiness" in Confucianism. Mencius discussed politics and regarded sufficient food, sufficient military strength, and trustworthiness as the three essentials. If it is necessary to abandon two of the three, then trustworthiness must be maintained, because the people cannot stand without trustworthiness. Mencius also advocated that wherever great righteousness lies, one should move forward bravely regardless of everything. Therefore, it is said: "There are things that are desired more than life, so one gives up life and takes righteousness." When we talk about new political morality, those in power must adhere to trustworthiness. Any policy that benefits the people should not be determined in the first place; but if it is determined, it must be realized and implemented effectively. This is "trustworthiness" internally. Collaborating with Japan to declare war on Britain and the United States requires practicing wartime life and contributing everything to cooperate in the war. This is "trustworthiness" externally.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to create a splendid and solemn Republic of China, just like an engineer building a building, we must use new methods to build it. The higher the upper floors are to be, the deeper the foundation must be, and the more the excavated old soil must be thrown away. This old soil is the current old habits and old airs in politics, where everything is only about appearances and not about reality, only about decoration and not about practice, only about flattery and not about accepting loyal admonishment, only about perfunctory answers and not about being serious. This foundation is precisely the new political morality we mentioned above. Only when we throw away these old soils far away will we be able to make the foundation deep, and only when the foundation is deep will the building of the Republic of China be built more magnificently, splendidly, and solemnly in the future!</p>

<h3>Japan Promptly Fulfils Its Promise: Preparatory Committee for Burmese Independence Established; Philippine Independence to be Recognized as Soon as Possible; Filipino People Express Loyalty and Trust</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee held its establishment ceremony on the 8th, marking the beginning of Burmese independence. The Burmese branch director of the Indian Independence League, District Leader Gan Ni, issued the following statement on the 8th: After the establishment of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee, the future of Burma is even brighter. The task of the committee is to establish a new Burma with its own sovereignty and responsibility. This achievement is entirely due to the friendly attitude of the government. Japan has promptly fulfilled its promises to Burma, which proves that Burma will develop into an independent country in the near future. We Indians are extremely happy to witness Burma's active progress towards independence, as this is precisely the path that India must take. It is wise to entrust the responsibility of building Burma to the Burmese people.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The 8th was the first day of preparation for Burma's glorious independence. The streets of Rangoon were filled with shouts of "Long Live Burma!" The city's joy and gratitude were no less than the pleasant situation when listening to Prime Minister Tojo's statement on the radio a few days ago. Seeing the Burmese people all beaming with joy, pedestrians also patted each other on the shoulders and shook hands, congratulating each other. Burma, which had not even dreamed of independence under British rule, is now being realized only a year after the Japanese army entered. Its joy can be imagined. The masses held peacock flags and continuously visited pagodas and temples, praying for a happy future and vowing to carry out the desire for an independent war.</p>
<p>Bamo, Chairman of the Committee, Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Bamo, Chairman of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee, delivered a passionate speech at noon on the 8th at the establishment ceremony of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee. The following is a summary of the main points: We, as the leaders of Burma, are working hard in today's world order to create a new country with special rights and obligations. This is a great historical undertaking. Burma is at this historical turning point, and the responsibilities we bear are extremely important and great. Since we have encountered this difficult opportunity, we must jointly bear this important responsibility and remember the pain of the past. The time for us to act has come. If we fail, we will not only fail future generations, but also cause the Burmese people to feel deeply disappointed in the present and the future. The ongoing world war is enough to determine our fate. Therefore, we must thoroughly defeat the enemies of the Greater East Asia. Furthermore, what we should build is a new world order, especially a new order and co-prosperity sphere in East Asia. These realistic situations should not be forgotten. If Japan wins, our independence can be realized. Japan respects its promise to grant us independence and uses its military strength and political ideals to save Burma and East Asia in the spirit of a pioneer. Japan came to Burma for this reason. The meaning of the new order in East Asia is that Japan grants us an independent country and becomes a sovereign country. Therefore, under the concept of mutual dependence, we must work hard to build Asia and strengthen the organizations of East Asian nations for the sake of the entire Asia. Today, all East Asian nations have completely vowed to live and die together. In fact, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – A famous Filipino reporter, Mr. Javier, recently expressed his feelings on Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines, saying: Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines is a glorious and epoch-making event in Filipino history. He said in essence: "The dawn of the Philippines has arrived. The Philippines is now resolutely rising up as a link in East Asia and as one of the world's nations to strive for independence. Recalling that we Filipinos have always groaned under the oppression of European and American imperialism for a long time and have been their slaves, but today, Japan, the strongest country in the world, its Prime Minister graciously visits, we have gained the glorious position of an ally in the New Order of East Asia and are regarded as a member of the cooperation and construction of East Asia. The Philippines was ruled by Spain for the past three centuries, and by the United States for the past forty years. Of course, at that time, we also had representatives participating in politics, but they only knew how to desperately seek personal gain and did not hesitate to wag their tails and beg for mercy from the United States, and they did not know how to seek benefits for the people. When the Philippines fell into such a tragic situation, fortunately, the strong Japan rescued the remaining people from the fire and water. Therefore, when Prime Minister Tojo came to visit, 400,000 people in Manila gathered in Luneta Park for a grand thanksgiving meeting, which was a natural phenomenon. Prime Minister Tojo also clarified Japan's policies towards us at the meeting and will raise the position we hope for. We are deeply grateful. Prime Minister Tojo also stepped into the cheerful Filipino crowd after the meeting and smiled and bowed to the crowd, and his emotions were very sincere. The people were all grateful for this. In the past few centuries, we have been in a colonial status and regarded as slaves by European and American powers, and we are even more deceived by the so-called" and "Democracy". In the past, we would look at those who saved us with the greatest sincerity with suspicion. We must respond to any attitude, that is, we must immediately repay those who treat us with friendship. In this autumn of major turmoil in the world situation, we are promised that we will be recognized as independent as soon as possible. Considering the past Spanish and American oppression, this fact is beyond our imagination. We vow to repay this with loyalty and trust. We always remember Vargas's words: "If Japan can win, we can be free. Under the guidance of Japan, we can work hard in the position of a free and independent nation, and our destiny will be unfolded."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Tokyo</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo of Japan and his party, including the Director of the Army Affairs Bureau, Mr. Sato, arrived in the Philippines from Tokyo on the 5th, and carefully inspected the local military and political conditions. He had an intimate conversation with the Chief of Administration of Vargas and gave a cordial direction on the construction of the New Philippine Islands. He set off from Manila on the 6th and stopped briefly in Taiwan. He arrived in Fukuoka on the 8th and stayed overnight in Osaka that night. He set off from Osaka at 10:30 am on the 9th and returned to Tokyo at 0:40 pm. He went to the Prime Minister's official residence to rest. In total, Prime Minister Tojo's trip lasted one week.</p>

I remember serving at the Consulate General ten years ago, when there were only more than 30 Japanese residents in Nanjing. Today, I see the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese people, and I feel as if it is another world. I sincerely hope to take office as soon as possible to fulfill my personal wish to bring Chinese and Japanese people closer together. In the midst of the completion of the Greater East Asia War, we can only further unite sincerely to realize our common ideals.</p>

<h3>The Disaster in Shandong and Henan Provinces is Severe; A Telegram is Sent to Chairman Wang Requesting Urgent Relief; Chairman Wang Replies by Telegram that He has Ordered a Swift Plan for Relief</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Wang Yintai, Supervisor of the General Office of the Ministry of Industry of the North China Political Affairs Committee, received a telegram from Governor Tang of Shandong Province and Governor Tian of Henan Province stating: The disaster in the two provinces is severe, please provide grain for relief. In addition to having tried his best to find ways to provide some emergency relief, he has specially reported the situation to Chairman Wang in a telegram requesting the Ministry to allocate grain to relieve the disaster and alleviate the urgent need. Chairman Wang has replied to Supervisor Wang in a telegram, requesting that the relevant departments quickly plan for relief to alleviate the people's suffering. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below: National Government Chairman Wang Junjian: I have just received a telegram from Governor Tang of Shandong Province stating: Agricultural production in this province has been poor for years, especially last year. Now is the time when the old crops have been exhausted and the new crops have not yet arrived. The grass roots and tree bark have been dug up almost entirely. Cases of people committing suicide by hanging themselves on mountains are often heard. I inspected the Donglindao area yesterday, and the land is like a desert, with no water or grass growing. The tragic situation I witnessed burned my heart. The disaster situation reported by various places is roughly the same. Grain relief is urgently needed. Please allocate 20,000 tons of grain purchased from the south to alleviate the suffering, etc. I have also received a telegram from Governor Tian of Henan Province with the same information. The disaster situation in the north this year is severe, and the people are not living well. Rice bran and wheat bran are all treasures for hungry people to prolong their lives. Your Excellency cares about the people's suffering and has always been concerned about the foundation of the country. I have also reported the situation and pleaded for the people.

I have ordered the relevant departments to quickly plan for relief to alleviate the people's suffering. I am replying to you by telegram first, Wang Zhaoming Qing.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ishiwatari, Emergency Advisor, Speaks in Shanghai on Financial, Food, and Price Issues</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the Supreme Advisor of the National Government, went to Shanghai on the 6th to inspect the recent economic situation in Shanghai. He met with reporters at his residence on the afternoon of the 7th and answered reporters' questions on various issues such as finance, currency, prices, and food. The content of the conversation is roughly as follows: (1) Finance and Currency: Since the suspension of the issuance of new military tickets, the adjustment of the military ticket and reserve voucher at the same price has been proceeding smoothly according to the planned plan. The most important thing at present is how to stabilize the currency value and control prices. On the one hand, we must strengthen local productivity, and on the other hand, we must take comprehensive measures to stabilize prices. What is currently planned is the issuance of prize-linked savings lottery tickets and food storage certificates, etc. At the same time, we hope that powerful Chinese commercial banks can set up branches in various places to absorb funds from the interior. It is also extremely important to convert idle funds into production, so the National Government must fully consider the reorganization of small and medium-sized banks. (2) Price Issues: During wartime, handling prices is a major issue for any country. The most important method is to strengthen the exchange of materials to reduce prices, especially food prices, which have a great impact on material prices. This year's wheat harvest in Central China is very abundant. At the same time, thanks to Japan's efforts, a considerable amount of Southeast Asian rice has been imported into Shanghai. We should take this opportunity to reduce food prices. If there is a good harvest and no hoarding occurs, the exchange of materials between Central China and North China will gradually become smooth. Of course, we should also consider the needs of Central China when supplying materials to North China. (3) Purchasing and Distribution Agencies: Since the preparation of the National Commercial Control General Association, we must work hard to form internal organizations and institutions. The operation of the association must not only strive to eliminate the past direction of liberalism, but also strive to complete the war according to the national system and enter the path of a controlled economy. Only in this way can price controls be resolutely continued, and the budget for production should also be taken into account, so that the situation of low production efficiency does not occur. As for the issue of hoarding, it is of course appropriate to take decisive measures. In short, everything should be based on the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we should especially cooperate to achieve the goals of the country.</p>

<h3>American Air Force Stationed in Chongqing, Indiscriminate Bombing of Guangzhou City, Two Enemy Planes Shot Down by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army announced at 2:00 PM on the 9th that seven bombers from the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Guangzhou around 3:20 PM on the 8th, dropping dozens of bombs and strafing with machine guns on bustling streets in the city, resulting in many civilian casualties. At that time, Japanese aircraft immediately took off to intercept and shot down two enemy planes, after which the enemy planes fled in a panic. This bombing by enemy aircraft targeted innocent civilians, revealing their intention to cause disruption and fully demonstrating their cruel bestiality. Such inhumane behavior is intolerable to both humans and gods. The Japanese army is determined to completely annihilate them.</p>
<p>Statement by the Head of the Japanese Military Reporting Department</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The head of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army's reporting department issued a statement at 5:00 PM today, the gist of which was: The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Guangzhou on the 8th, indiscriminately bombing various parts of the city. This kind of behavior is extremely brutal. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, they fled in a panic. This act of violence by enemy aircraft, like the previous bombing of Guangzhou Bay, fully demonstrates their anxiety after being criticized by Chongqing. In particular, they targeted the people of the peaceful zone, attempting to disrupt and attack bustling streets, and used machine guns to strafe and kill innocent civilians. Such heinous acts are intolerable under international law and humanitarian principles. This is concrete proof of the cruel nature of the Americans. The Japanese side is determined to use a spirit of courage and bravery to annihilate this inhumane American Air Force. The people in the peaceful areas of China are also unanimously indignant about this and vow revenge. Such actions by the enemy may continue to occur in the future. The people of China and Japan must further unite and prepare for air defense to destroy the violent enemy.</p>

<h3>Building an Economic Shanghai, Accomplishing Sino-Japanese Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Takechi Fumihiko</p>
<p>(1) Shifting from Japanese control to Chinese control.</p>
<p>(2) Changing from government control to control by autonomous enterprises.</p>
<p>(3) Abolishing the special rights of Japanese trading companies and establishing a Sino-Japanese equality system.</p>
<p>(4) Breaking away from the economic fragmentation of one area and realizing the economy of all of China as a single unit, to serve as the foundation of an economic Shanghai.</p>
<p>What a great fundamental change this is! The announcement of this new policy has attracted the attention of people in the business communities of China and Japan. However, we should remember that this abandonment of initiative by the Japanese side and the abolition of the special rights of Japanese trading companies in the Chinese economy are not the result of the Chinese side's active policy of recovering rights, but rather the Japanese side's thinking on a grand scale, "to have the Chinese engage in the revitalization and construction of the Chinese economy," and therefore voluntarily abandoning them. Furthermore, the revival and development of the Chinese economy is the economy of China's original appearance, and the completion of the goal of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must be achieved through the alignment of ideals, the unification of interests, and the promotion of efficiency. It cannot be achieved through the exercise of power or the maintenance and abuse of special rights. This is the practical conclusion reached after examining the facts.</p>
<p>The reasons and guiding principles for the new economic transformation can be explained as above. The next question is, what will be the results of implementing the new economic policy? This is still in the preparation stage. How the new economic policy is practiced and how it is operated is the dividing point between the merits and demerits of the new policy. Regarding the operational guidelines, I am imitating the old trick of "using your spear to attack your shield." Let us try to study the economic development guidelines described by Kong Xiangxi, the head of the Executive Yuan of the Chongqing regime, in his instructions at the "Production Conference." At the Production Conference in the 28th year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi emphasized the importance of production in the wartime economy. The economic development guidelines he spoke of were four: (1) No one should be wasted, (2) No materials should be wasted, (3) Be economical, and (4) Be timely.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The so-called "be economical" means to apply economic principles and promote economic efficiency in controlled economy and planned economy. Over the past six years, the local economy has been blinded by the form of "politics dominating the economy" in controlled economy and planned economy, and has gone against economic principles, resulting in unexpected failures. The shortcomings of the non-economic nature of the controlled economy and planned economy can be compensated for by fully utilizing economic principles. Moreover, in this year of decisive battle, it is even more necessary to utilize economic principles.</p>
<p>"Be timely" emphasizes the "time" factor in the wartime economy. If one is not timely and cannot adapt to changing circumstances, it is inevitable that opportunities will be missed.</p>
<p>The above principles must be guided forward based on the comprehensiveness of the entire economy, so that the entire economy can operate in an organized manner. The current local economic situation particularly needs this. At the same time, it must be understood that only at this stage can the truth of transformation diplomacy be realized.</p>
<p>Let me add one more sentence here. When I was talking with a certain minister of the Nanjing government last time, we accidentally talked about the price issue. I said at the time: Today's price issue in Shanghai cannot be explained by the economic principles learned in universities: (1) supply and demand of materials, and (2) monetary theory. Nor is it, as some people say, (3) due to the unrest in the world war situation. It is really caused by the "lack of an economic reality in China." Therefore, the governments of China and Japan must confirm this fact in cabinet meetings or state council meetings, get to the root of the problem, and create an "economic Shanghai" that revives and constructs Shanghai's production and dominates the entire Chinese economy. If this step is not taken, there is no hope for the recovery and construction of the Chinese economy, the unification of the Chinese economy, and the true purpose of transformation diplomacy cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Finally, I must offer one word of advice: There is pessimism regarding the construction of an "economic Shanghai." They say: The Shanghai economy has always relied on trade. However, this trade is now cut off and difficult to restore, so the "construction of a consumer Shanghai" is extremely difficult. Now, the only question is whether Shanghai can use its existing inventory to extend its economic life. The above pessimism does not need to be refuted in detail. However, I have some points to criticize these pessimists' fallacies: (1) They cannot appreciate the subtle use of "the enemy's blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic recovery," and (2) they only know that the Shanghai economy has always relied on trade, mistakenly believing that China has no power of self-sufficiency, believing that China's inability to break away from the sub-colonial character of trade dependence is due to the international shackles of agreed tariff systems and unequal treaties. Therefore, China has to be an investment country for other countries and an international trade market, which hinders the development of industry.</p>
<p>The purpose of this transformation diplomacy, the economy, is the construction of "economic Shanghai," and it must not be built elsewhere. Only the establishment of "economic Shanghai" is the foundation for the revival and construction of the Chinese economy and the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood, and it is also the foundation for grasping popular sentiment and maintaining the permanent relationship between China and Japan. It is even more the key to completing the Greater East Asia War and the great path to the surrender of Chongqing and the unification of China. "Intelligence is not as good as recognizing the trend." Only this great transformation is an enlightenment for the common prosperity of China and Japan, and it is also a good opportunity to create a unified situation. May the Chinese and Japanese military, government, and people adapt to this enlightenment and move forward bravely, build "economic Shanghai," and accomplish "Sino-Japanese common prosperity." (Written in the afternoon of the auspicious day of Tencho) (Peng Xiang, translated from the May 6th Continental News)</p>

<h3>Roman Military Headquarters Issues Statement, Italy's Will to Fight Remains Strong, Empire Day Changed to Day of Rights in Africa to Commemorate Fall of Tunis and Bizerte</h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Italian military headquarters issued a statement on the 8th regarding the loss of Tunis and Bizerte, stating: The retreat of the Axis forces from Tunisia was long anticipated by the nation. The anti-Axis forces have more than adequate weapons and manpower, with a ratio of ten to one compared to the Axis forces, so their victory is only natural. But we are not at all pessimistic about the future of the war, and our will remains very strong. The Italian army has defended the area in the past, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces, and supported it for as long as May. This is a major military success for the Axis forces. The anti-Axis forces have attacked the area fiercely for a long time, but have not achieved any significant results. As far as the Axis forces are concerned, if the Tunisian war continues, large quantities of military supplies should be transported across the Strait of Sicily by ship, but shipping is very difficult and the damage is bound to be significant. Now that Tunisia has been abandoned, the ships can be used for other purposes, so this retreat is a good policy. As for the anti-Axis forces wanting to achieve their goals, it will still take some time. Although they landed in North Africa very smoothly, their slow pace of operations has missed a valuable opportunity.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – May 9th was originally Italian Empire Day and Overseas Italian Day. This year, it will be used as "Italy's Rights in Africa" day to commemorate the fall of Tunis and Bizerte. The slogan of the day is what the Italian Prime Minister said, "We must return to Africa." Italian newspapers today published articles describing Italy's achievements in its colonies during war and peace, and published pictures. Today, all cities and towns are flying national flags, and churches are holding ceremonies.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Continue to Resist in Tunisian Coastal Areas</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – News received here tonight is that the Axis forces' strong resistance in Tunisia has not disintegrated. Several powerful Axis units are currently continuing to resolutely defend in the coastal areas, and are still able to establish contact with another powerful unit to jointly utilize a base for operations, and their traffic with other resistance centers further north has not been cut off. Although General Anderson's First Army and the American Fifth Army have occupied land in the east, the heavy price paid is unprecedented since the outbreak of the North African war. The war has now developed to the level of short-range engagements, tank against tank, artillery against artillery, and infantry against infantry. One Axis anti-aircraft battery has destroyed no less than fifty-four British and American tanks east of Mateur. Also, when the Axis forces were unable to transport artillery back to the rear due to lack of fuel, they destroyed it themselves. When the enemy forces approached, they engaged in close combat. Seven enemy tanks were also destroyed by hand grenades.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – German and Italian forces fought the numerically and materially superior enemy, initially launching counterattacks from the northern and central sections of the North African front against the anti-Axis forces advancing towards Tunis and Bizerte. After the anti-Axis forces broke through and occupied these two bases, the Axis forces suffered a serious blow, but they still counterattacked. The Axis forces have been cut off into several isolated pockets of resistance. According to Berlin news, several main forces are fighting in the coastal areas and the area from Zaghouan to Enfidaville. Slightly further north, another Axis unit is fighting the British Eighth Army. Fierce hand-to-hand combat is taking place in all areas. The British and American forces are gradually forcing back the Axis forces by using large tank formations and hundreds of fighters and bombers. East of Mateur, an Axis anti-aircraft battery destroyed fifty-four of the anti-Axis tank force of at least 120 tanks, and later destroyed seven more. Such heroic resistance is seen in battles in all areas, but Rome and Berlin are not overly hopeful for a long-term Axis resistance. According to Reuters news, the British First Army concentrated more than 400 tanks on the Plains of Saint Cyprien on Friday and attacked a line only nine miles long. The Axis forces then retreated to the second line of resistance. After the anti-Axis air force cleared the way for the ground forces to enter Tunis, they have now turned to naval activities, hoping to disrupt Axis shipping.</p>
<h3>Future Military in Tunisia Lacks Tactical Importance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Hatom News Agency military commentary expert Sertorius declared tonight: Tunisia is still undergoing fierce fighting, but the outcome of this battle is no longer in doubt. In principle, how the battle will turn out has long been determined. The anti-Axis forces have large amounts of resources and materials in the North African theater, so from the beginning it was very possible for them to overcome the German and Italian bridgehead. When the British and American forces gained air superiority in addition to their original naval superiority in the Mediterranean region, this possibility became a certainty. Since then, the enemy forces have landed in Algiers and Morocco, and it has become increasingly difficult for the Axis forces operating in North Africa to obtain the necessary supplies and sufficient reinforcements. Therefore, the disparity in strength between the two sides increased every month, and later the sea and air traffic from Sicily to Tunisia deteriorated to the point of insignificance due to the enemy forces' superiority at sea and in the air. Under these circumstances, the Axis forces were still able to hold out for as long as six months, so it can be said that the Axis forces have achieved their greatest success. Regarding the enemy side, we also acknowledge that a large part of the British infantry and tank forces (compared to the more mediocre American forces) fought well. Although the British generals cannot achieve outstanding results, they have at least gained a lot of tactical lessons since the beginning of this war, such as using large numbers of tanks, setting up centralized locations, and cooperating with the air force. But if the Axis leaders could maintain a strength ratio of one to two or even one to three, it would be difficult for the enemy forces to succeed. But in fact, the Axis forces fought with one against ten, and the anti-Axis success in North Africa should be entirely credited to the British Navy and Air Force. After Tunis and Bizerte are occupied, the British and Americans no longer need to spend their minds on combat issues, and can completely occupy the remaining parts of the North African Axis bridgehead, but they cannot obtain any military glory from this. The German and Italian forces have lost the main base of their entire defensive line, and have also been divided into several centers of resistance. Furthermore, due to the enemy forces' absolute superiority at sea and in the air, they are completely unable to maintain their supply of military supplies and food. From now on, the enemy forces' navy and air force will be even more effective. These German and Italian troops who are fighting are still fighting bravely, determined to inflict the greatest possible losses on the enemy until the very last moment. They will surely get their wish, but sooner or later they will be overwhelmed by the pressure of a large number of enemy troops. How the British and Americans will accomplish this is no longer worth noting. From now on, the war in Tunisia lacks tactical importance. The only strategy that can be used is spiritual. We can ensure that the German army's spirit of fighting will shine brightly, proving its heroism.</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Qualified sources here announced yesterday through the Stefani Agency that the numerically superior British and American forces have been trying to end the North African war for months. They suffered extremely heavy losses during the preparation phase and when attacking the Axis fortresses due to the valiant resistance of the German and Italian forces. As a result, they were finally able to enter Tunis and Bizerte, but the resistance is still continuing east of Bizerte and along the central and southern sections of the front. The Axis forces in this area are bravely resisting the numerically superior enemy. It would be a serious mistake to only consider the results obtained by the enemy forces in the recent battles in North Africa. It should not be forgotten that the war in this area began on June 10, 1940. For three years, although Britain has mobilized the strength of its entire empire, and since November last year has also obtained the assistance of the American army and air force, it has not achieved a decisive victory. The enemy forces, with their large forces in all three services and the full assistance of a powerful air force, still encountered serious resistance from the valiant German and Italian forces. The Axis resistance lasted longer than the enemy had expected, so the German and Italian command was able to adopt the necessary countermeasures. Therefore, in terms of the entire war, the fall of Bizerte and Tunis has not shaken the Axis's military situation. If we study the war situation in the Mediterranean, we can see that the British and American forces control the south, while the Axis forces control the north. The latter has a long time to organize its positions.</p>
<h3>Contending for Mediterranean Hegemony, Major Naval and Air Battles Imminent</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to London news, although the British military is very excited about the victory in Tunisia, it is well aware that the Axis forces have completed an important strategic task, because the Mediterranean Sea has become a no-man's land, and the naval and air forces of both sides are bound to fight each other to the death. There are many speculations in London about the future actions of the Axis forces, with divergent opinions and many pessimists. The Standard Evening News's claim that the Mediterranean belongs to me is no longer supported by the public. Vincent, a famous British naval expert, pointed out that the Axis and anti-Axis naval and air forces will have a bloody battle in the Mediterranean to seize hegemony. He said that since Sicily and Sardinia are owned by the Axis forces, navigation on the anti-Axis sea lane is extremely dangerous. The fate of many anti-Axis escort ships that attempted to break through to Malta and were annihilated can serve as a warning. Assistance has not yet obtained a decisive victory. The enemy forces, with their large forces in all three services and the full assistance of a powerful air force, still encountered serious resistance from the valiant German and Italian forces. The Axis resistance lasted longer than the enemy had expected, so the German and Italian command was able to adopt the necessary countermeasures. Therefore, in terms of the entire war, the fall of Bizerte and Tunis has not shaken the Axis's military situation. If we study the war situation in the Mediterranean, we can see that the British and American forces control the south, while the Axis forces control the north. The latter has a long time to organize its positions.</p>
<h3>Military Changes in North Africa Do Not Affect Politics</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the North African war situation has changed rapidly, the anti-Axis countries have frequently promoted this, claiming that new changes will occur in the international political situation. The diplomatic authorities refuted this claim on the 8th and clarified their views as follows: Changes in the military situation in North Africa cannot cause any political impact. How the local war situation in Tunisia develops cannot create any obstacles to the Axis countries' final victory. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech on the 5th was extremely pertinent.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Weather Returns to Normal; Land and Air Battles Resume; Soviet Landing in the Sea of Azov Unsuccessful; Donets Front Recovered by Germans</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency's Eastern Front correspondent, Hanma, reported on the 8th on the current situation on the Eastern Front, stating: The weather on the Eastern Front has returned to normal, and the land has also dried out, resulting in intensified battles and air combat in various locations. In preparation for future war developments, the Soviet army has been making strenuous efforts to strengthen its positions in the Kuban region and various parts of the Central Donets-Volga region, including increasing its tank forces. On the 7th alone, 51 Soviet tanks were destroyed by the German army, and 106 aircraft were lost. Thus, the 7th can be considered the Soviet army's most unfortunate day. The Soviet army launched offensives across the entire front in an attempt to reduce German combat power, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The Soviet army in the Kuban region also launched an offensive, but was repelled by the German army, losing 30 tanks and 740 prisoners. In air combat, German aircraft shot down six Soviet assault fighters, and German anti-aircraft guns shot down 15 Soviet aircraft. When German aircraft flew over the coast of the Sea of Azov, they discovered a Soviet attempt to land. They immediately bombarded the landing force, sinking 16 fully loaded troop transport boats and heavily damaging 28 others. In the middle reaches of the Donets River, the Soviet army, under the cover of artillery, crossed the river and rushed to the west bank. The German army immediately shortened its lines, concentrated its main forces, and launched a fierce attack, driving them back and retaking the lost ground. In this battle, 263 Soviet soldiers were captured. Furthermore, 17 Soviet Douglas bombers bombed German positions. Four German fighters took off to intercept them and immediately shot down 14. South of Orel, the Soviet army attempted to seize German positions with powerful forces, but was repelled by the German army. In this battle, the German army destroyed nine Soviet tanks, captured hundreds of Soviet soldiers, seized countless light and heavy weapons, and shot down 36 Soviet aircraft. West of Velikiye Luki, the Soviet army also launched an offensive, but lost 12 tanks, 200 prisoners, and 11 mortars, as well as a large amount of ammunition. In the Volga region, the Soviet army attempted a night raid, but was completely annihilated by the German army.</p>

<h3>Symposium on the Current Situation in China During Wartime to be Held at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on April 9th</h3>
<p>Attendees: Chen Gongbo, Ōkawa Shūmei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, Yamamoto Sanematsu</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the Republic of China government, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Mayor of Shanghai, who visited Nanjing in response to Prime Minister Tōjō's visit, despite his busy schedule, discussed various issues concerning Japan and China with Mr. Ōkawa Shūmei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, and Yamamoto Sanematsu at the Imperial Hotel from 2:35 PM to 5:10 PM on April 9th. However, due to time constraints, more time was spent listening to Mr. Chen's opinions, and less time was available for the Japanese side to express their views, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Let me be the chairman today. Now, let me introduce the attendees. Starting from this side, the first is Mr. Ōkawa Shūmei, followed by Mr. Matsumoto Shigeharu, Mr. Tachibana Shiraki, and myself.</p>
<p>Chen: I am very happy to meet everyone today. For this meeting, please give me the topics, and I will answer them.</p>
<p>Looking back when I was studying in the United States, the professors sat in a row like this, and I, as a student, heard various things from the professors. That scene was exactly like this, but I later became a Ph.D. (laughter). Thinking about this makes me very happy.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: We are all private citizens, so please speak freely. We can talk about anything too. Otherwise, the conversation will not be interesting. Please don't be constrained by formalities, just talk casually!</p>
<p>One of the reasons why China and Japan have come to this fate is that Japan criticizes China for worshiping Europe and America. However, upon closer reflection, it seems that under the circumstances at the time, Japan also had no choice but to follow Europe and America. In all its diplomacy with China, Japan had no choice but to follow in the footsteps of Britain and America. We are well aware of this history. Therefore, if Japan and China jointly expel Britain and America from East Asia, and if there are no disruptors in between to sow discord between the two countries, then the situation that you are worried about will definitely be resolved naturally. - We, the peace comrades, have come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>So, how can we expel Britain and America from East Asia? This cannot be accomplished by China alone. If China were to do it, it could only launch riots or demonstrations within the country, such as the May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. To expel Britain and America from East Asia, no matter what, unless Japan takes the lead and launches a war, this wish cannot be achieved. I have repeatedly mentioned this opinion in public speeches and personal conversations when I came to your country two years ago, shortly after returning to the capital, in May of the 29th year of the Republic, as a goodwill ambassador. In particular, I mentioned the hope for a war like the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, when I had the honor of meeting with His Majesty the Emperor, I respectfully informed him that "the current East Asian problem is not just a problem between China and Japan, but a problem east of the Suez Canal." I also conveyed the same opinion to then-Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, Lieutenant General Sawada. To Commander Taniyama of the Yokosuka Naval Base, I also stated on a warship that "once something happens in the Pacific, the Republic of China is resolved to contribute all its material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War." There were also various other statements. In my commemorative album of the courtesy visit, various articles are recorded, but these statements, because they are related to military affairs, were not recorded. I will not mention these things for the time being, but I hope that you will not forget what I am about to say.</p>
<p>That is what was said at the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Konoe at the Seiyoken restaurant. At that time, I publicly expressed this opinion at the banquet: "Greater East Asia has two opportunities to truly cooperate. The first opportunity is when a crisis comes to East Asia, such as the arrival of the Greater East Asia War today. The past grievances will be forgotten, and China and Japan will unite as one and pledge to live and die together. This is the first opportunity: Another opportunity.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Chen has taken time out of his busy schedule to give us this time. We would like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>Now, please let Mr. Chen talk about the return of the concessions and the situation in Shanghai and China before and after the war.</p>
<p>Chen: Regarding the issue of participating in the war, I would like to present my opinion frankly and concretely.</p>
<p>Why did the National Government participate in the war? Let me first explain this point concretely.</p>
<p>When the peace movement started three years ago, I was in Chongqing. At that time, Mr. Wang Jingwei expressed such an ideal: "The reason for starting this peace movement is definitely not because China has been defeated and there is no other way to end this incident. We are not casually resolving the incident so that China can temporarily recuperate and then do something else. I am definitely not starting the peace movement and leaving Chongqing with such intentions." As you know, the reason why the two countries have entered a state of war is definitely not due to a short period, but due to decades of discord. Therefore, if we first casually resolve the incident, it will only be a temporary change, and perhaps such an incident will happen again in the future. For example, in Europe, there is a state of affairs where war is necessary to repeat every twenty or ten years. Needless to say, Europe has many countries, unlike East Asia, which is simple. The main countries are only China and Japan; but if this state of opposition between China and Japan continues to exist, then even if the incident ends temporarily, war will definitely break out every twenty or ten years. Therefore, our work is to prevent this incident from recurring forever, so I am studying how to make both Japan and China strive towards the same common goal.</p>
<p>At that time, if Japan and China decided on a common goal, it would be to drive the British and American imperialists out of East Asia. There is no other way besides this. If both countries have such aspirations, then the two countries will unite as one and can achieve a common goal. This principle was not conceived because of the incident. The Kuomintang of the Republic of China already had this slogan when it was reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic. However, the reason why this goal was not achieved later was because Chiang Kai-shek colluded with Britain and America.</p>
<p>For example, after Japan and China establish peace, we must establish an Eastern international organization in our East - like the League of Nations in the West, so that Greater East Asia becomes one, otherwise, true cooperation will be impossible to achieve in the future.</p>
<p>Why do I say these things? It is because I thought that even if a muddled peace is established temporarily, if the obstruction and instigation of Britain and America join from the outside, then the peace that was specially established will inevitably be destroyed, so no matter what, we must remove the obstructers and the cancer of peace. This is the way to seek eternal peace. Today, such a great Greater East Asia War has been launched under your country's guidance. Of course, China must realize what I have said about participating in the war and contribute all its human and material resources. My long-cherished wish and long-awaited hope can be realized, so I feel very happy.</p>
<p>On December 8th of the year before last, your country declared war on Britain and America, with a grand official declaration of war. At this time, a glimpse into Japan's intentions reveals that Japan has indicated that it will bear the responsibility for the Greater East Asia War, that Japan is capable of shouldering it alone, and that it need not burden China. The cadres of the National Government, upon receiving such kind intentions from Japan, immediately expressed their desire to participate in the war, and it was not until January 9th of this year that participation was realized.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang immediately declared that he would share weal and woe with Japan. Why did he not say live and die together at that time? This is because the time to participate in the war had not yet arrived, so we had to share weal and woe no matter what. With the realization of this participation in the war, we have entered the realm of living and dying together. Japan, of course, is displaying the spirit of Bushido, bearing the burden alone, and not wanting to trouble others, but on the Chinese side, we believe that not only in terms of friendship, but also from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia, we can no longer be stingy and should contribute everything to the Greater East Asia War, because saving East Asia is saving China. The above is the answer to the question of why China is participating in the war.</p>
<p>Next, I will report on the actual situation after participating in the war.</p>
<p>First, it is the change in public sentiment after participating in the war. Before participating in the war, there was inevitably a negative attitude towards various aspects of materials. However, due to the participation of the National Government in this war, the people's psychology has changed, and they all believe that the Greater East Asia War is our business. Participating in the Greater East Asia War is not only the natural task of a member of East Asia, but also the honor of a member of the East. Therefore, psychologically, they have all changed and believe that they should automatically take out materials for themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, the participation of the National Government in the war did not only originate from the cadres of the National Government, but also solicited the opinions of the national economic circles, financial circles, and all classes. At that time, national public opinion was boiling, and everyone unanimously wanted to eliminate Britain and America through the Greater East Asia War, and believed that participating in the Greater East Asia War was a matter of course. Now, I will report on the current state of change in public sentiment.</p>
<p>After participating in the war, thanks to the establishment of various great policy changes in your country, public sentiment has become more inclined towards the Nanjing government. In particular, the problem of material control was resolved on the 16th of last month (March). As you know, in the past, materials were circulating piecemeal in various places, so blood was not circulating, but since the implementation of this new policy of material control, materials from various central locations have been concentrated in Shanghai. Of course, prices were soaring in the past, but now prices are gradually falling, and the lives of the people are showing a state of peace and joy. Taking Shanghai as an example, factories in Shanghai were unable to start production at all in the past. Why? Because the various items manufactured by the factories could not be transported anywhere due to material control, so the factories could not obtain profits, and the factories themselves could not stand. However, since the implementation of this new material control policy, all factories have recovered. Not only that, but an increase in production can also be realized. Recently, the Central Reserve Bank has released 500 million yuan in funds for the restoration and increased production of factories. I think everyone will be happy to hear this good news recently.</p>
<p>I will only talk about the issue of participating in the war up to this point. Now, let's listen to everyone's questions about the next topic.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jinhai Case: Attorney Files Petition in Capital; Peng Shuanglong's Family Requests Transfer to Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>The central government and the city government are extremely concerned about the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Hosiery Factory in the French Concession, who died from torture, and Peng Shuanglong, who was seriously injured. Minister Luo of the Ministry of Justice personally came to Shanghai to investigate the truth. The city government has also made serious representations to the French Concession's Municipal Council. The Western detective, Millet, has already been escorted and will be prosecuted by the French Consular Court. The other defendants have also been summoned by the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. To redress the grievances of the Zhang Jinhai family, they entrusted attorney Shao Bao'san to represent them in a petition and appeal during Minister Luo's visit to Shanghai. It is reported that attorney Shao took the night train last night to travel to the capital and file petitions with various agencies in the capital, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Propaganda, and the Ministry of Social Welfare.</p>
<p>Peng's Family Files Petition to Change Hospital</p>
<p>Peng Shuanglong, a 17-year-old apprentice who suffered serious injuries, has been receiving treatment at Guangci Hospital. His injuries are quite severe. Citizens from all walks of life in the city have visited the hospital to express their sympathy to Peng, but they have been refused by the hospital. Unexpectedly, the family of Peng brought dinner to the hospital the night before last to provide him with food, but they were also strongly refused and not allowed to see him. After the family politely requested, they were ignored. The Peng family then approached the French Concession police for assistance, but to no avail. Fearing that an accident might occur, the Peng family filed a petition with the Special No. 2 Court yesterday, requesting that the injured Peng Shuanglong be transferred to another hospital for treatment and that he be allowed to move to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>French Police Department Corrects News Report</h3>
<p>Since the Zhang case occurred, Justice Minister Luo Junqiang made a special trip from Nanjing to Shanghai, instructing his subordinates to adhere to the judicial position and strive for strict handling from the French authorities, and to urge the punishment of the perpetrators. According to a letter from the French Police Department: The report in various newspapers on the 8th of this month stated that Gu Shuo, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Justice, accompanied by Secretary Lai and Peng Wangshi, a member of the Ministry of Justice, met with Fabre, the Superintendent of the French Concession Police Department, and that Fabre stated that "if any unexpected incidents occur, the police department still has the authority to take necessary measures to maintain security within the concession." However, this topic was not discussed during the meeting on that day. The Superintendent of the French Police only said: "The French police authorities are currently very busy with security issues such as Baojia, public security, food, and air defense. We hope that everyone will assist and guide us at any time. The Zhang case occurred due to individual negligence and violation of instructions. I guarantee that this matter will be handled seriously and impartially according to the law." It did not involve the talks reported in the newspapers. Please correct this.</p>
<p>Background of Madam Li</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) According to the reporter's investigation from various sources, the woman surnamed Li, who falsely accused Zhang and Peng, originally surnamed Li and named Xiuying, is the mistress of the Minle Teahouse at the intersection of Kangti Road and Malang Road in the French Concession. Her husband works at a gambling table in Nanshi and is a follower of Guo Shiyuan, the defendant in the case. Guo usually recruits many followers and has considerable influence in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Donation Method</p>
<p>The family of the deceased is very grateful for the great concern and generous donations from the fellow citizens of the city. The receiving agencies have been completely entrusted to the major newspapers in the city. There is no need to send donations to other agencies and law firms to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p>
<h3>Donations Received</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a total of more than 2,600 yuan in donations from all walks of life to express condolences to the family of Mr. Zhang and to assist Peng Shuanglong with medical and legal expenses.

<h3>Jian Jianwu's Broadcast Last Night: A Plea for the Anti-British and American Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM, the Chinese National Anti-British and American Association specially invited Mr. Jian Jianwu, Deputy Minister of the Central Social Department, to give a radio speech at the Shanghai Radio Station in this city. The topic was "From Anti-British and American Work to the Greater East Asia War." He elaborated in detail on the significance of anti-British and American work and its relationship with the Greater East Asia War. The gist of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Speech</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots: Today, my topic is "From Anti-British and American Work to the Greater East Asia War." This is because anti-British and American work is closely related to the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War can be said to be the practice of anti-British and American work, and anti-British and American work can only fulfill its mission under the guarantee of victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, I will briefly explain the significance of anti-British and American work and its connection to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>We know that the significance of anti-British and American work is not a narrow sense of xenophobia, but contains the revolutionary significance of oppressed nations. Britain and the United States are the two countries with the most colonies and the longest or most ingenious history of aggression in the world. From Africa to Europe, from Europe to Asia, we can see their acts of aggression everywhere. Although the United States' history of aggression is later than that of Britain, its methods of aggression are superior to those of Britain. China has been subjected to imperialist aggression for a century, leading to its decline into a semi-colonial status. Tracing back through history, the main culprit is Britain, and the one that intensified the situation is the United States. This is not only true in China, but also true for all nations in East Asia. Therefore, the history of China in the last hundred years can be said to be a history of aggression by British and American imperialists. The history of East Asia in the last two or three hundred years can be said to be a colonial history of British and American imperialism. The world history since the eighteenth century can be said to be a history of rampant British and American imperialists. Therefore, anti-British and American work is a revolutionary movement of the Chinese nation in China, an anti-Western aggression movement of East Asian nations in East Asia, and an anti-oppression movement of oppressed nations throughout the world. Anti-British and American work is not only work that China should do, but also work that the entire East Asian nations and even all nations oppressed by Britain and the United States should work together on. This is the first point that everyone should understand.</p>
<p>Since anti-British and American work is a revolutionary work of oppressed nations against British and American aggression, its non-xenophobic nature is very obvious. What we oppose are the colonial policies of British and American imperialists, the aggression of British and American imperialists, and the oppressive measures imposed on us by British and American imperialists. As for the British and American people who sympathize with us, we not only do not need to oppose them, but even need to join hands with them. As for the progressive science of Britain and the United States, we not only do not need to oppose it, but even need to adopt it. As for the excellent culture of Britain and the United States (excluding the culture of aggression), we not only do not need to oppose it, but even need to accept it. Therefore, our anti-British and American is anti-British and American aggression and oppression, not rejecting Britain and the United States. This is the second point that everyone should understand.</p>
<p>Secondly, we talk about the Greater East Asia War. We know that the Greater East Asia War is a war between the entire East Asian nation and British and American imperialists, and anti-British and American work is also the work of the entire East Asian nation resisting British and American imperialists. Therefore, the meanings of the two are one and two, and two and one. The Greater East Asia War can be said to be the practice of anti-British and American work, and anti-British and American work is also a part of the actual work of the Greater East Asia War. The biggest purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to establish permanent peace in East Asia, and it is British and American imperialists who are destroying this East Asian peace. Therefore, the target of the Greater East Asia War is British and American imperialists. This is undoubtedly certain, and it is undeniable that anti-British and American work has a common purpose and meaning with the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Since we have already understood that the Greater East Asia War is the practice of anti-British and American work, in order to carry out the mission of anti-British and American work, we must work with friendly nations to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and we must guarantee the success of anti-British and American work under the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai West District Baojia Office</h3>

<h3>The Fourth Installment of Rationed Cigarettes Immediately Available for Sale; Strict District Inspections to Prevent Abuses</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's fourth installment of goods is valued at 2,666.30 yuan for the Ding Card category. The goods allocated to the Bing, Yi, and Jia Card categories will increase proportionally. The allocated goods include products from Zhonghua, Hua, Nanyang, Rendong, Fuxin, and other brands. The goods have been withdrawn with payment since the 5th and are immediately available for sale. However, black market prices are still rampant. In order to effectively implement price limits and prevent reselling for profit, the Inspection Department of the Association has ordered all inspectors to conduct strict district inspections to prevent abuses. However, some cigarette merchants are suspected of refusing to sell and hoarding goods and have been warned separately. If they dare to re-offend, their rationing will be suspended, and the responsible persons will be prosecuted according to law. It is also reported that the registration of cigarette distribution companies has been closed since May 1st, and new applications for goods allocation are being rejected. At the same time, wholesale and retail merchants are strictly ordered to be courteous to cigarette purchasers and to pay special attention to the preservation of tobacco. If there are any dampness, aroma, odor, or easily dispersed powders, they must not be close to the tobacco. The retail prices of cigarettes and the signs issued by the Association should be hung in a place easily visible to cigarette purchasers. In addition, the fifth batch of cigarettes will be distributed after the 15th.</p>
<h3>Lianbao Chief in Nanshi Dismissed for Malpractice</h3>
<p>Wang Zhongheng, the Lianbao Chief of the 14th Lianbao in the First Fang of Nanshi, has habitually abused his power, exploited the citizens, and committed fraud and coercion. Recently, citizens in the area submitted a document to the Municipal Baojia Committee to report and accuse him. After receiving the report, the Committee immediately sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the allegations, and all were found to be true. The Chairman of the Committee, Lu Ying, was extremely angered upon learning of this and immediately dismissed Wang Zhongheng from his post for investigation, as a warning to others, to effectively rectify the Baojia system in the urban area.</p>
<h3>Xu Songyao's Coffin Approved by the Court for Opening; Case of Killing His Brother Concluded; Two Coffins to Be Transported to Their Hometown for Burial</h3>
<p>The case of Xu Daquan, the young owner of the Huachang Pharmacy, who killed his brother Xu Songyao in the early winter of the previous year, caused a sensation in society. The murderer Xu Daquan has been executed, and the entire case has been concluded. However, Xu Songyao's coffin was previously seized by the Special Second Court, which sent personnel to open the coffin for inspection and then sealed it, temporarily storing it in the Shanghai Funeral Parlor. Now that the case has been concluded for three months and Daquan has been executed for one hundred days, the Xu family intends to transport both coffins back to their hometown in Jiading for burial. They specially requested the Special Second Court to open the seal and return the coffins. The court approved the request and sent personnel to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor to open Xu Songyao's coffin, which was then claimed by his family.</p>

<h3>Lianyi Cup Unveils with Exhibition Match: Xu Hui Lian Wins Against Shengyou 7-2, An Unexpected Outcome</h3>
<p>The Lianyi Cup mini-football tournament kicked off yesterday with an exhibition match between Xu Hui Lian and Shengyou. Lin Kanghou performed the opening kick, with He Chunhui as the referee. The silver whistle signaled the start of the intense battle. Xu Hui Lian, boosted by the support of Lianyi players, showed great strength. Less than five minutes into the match, Wang Wenyi swept a goal from the right, but soon after, Xu Lian conceded a penalty, which H. Pantinson converted, making it 1-1. Unexpectedly, Xu Lian's Gao Baozheng was blessed with good fortune and scored three consecutive goals, each shot clear and beautiful, leaving Shengyou helpless. The first half ended with Xu Lian leading 4-1. In the second half, Gao Baozheng scored again with a header within minutes, adding to the excitement. Then, Fei Chunhua's excellent corner kick broke through the net, making it 6-1. A few minutes later, Gao Baozheng, single-handedly dribbling past three defenders, shot and scored, making it 7-1. Finally, Shengyou's H. Pantinson scored a goal to reduce the deficit, and the game ended. In conclusion, Xu Hui Lian defeated Shengyou 7-2, an unexpected outcome. The organizers of the match, Pan Sansheng and others, were present to watch the game. Xu Hui Lian's victory was largely due to Gao Baozheng's five goals. Fei Chunhua also performed well, and defenders Qu Yongfu, Wu Qixiang, and McPherson all fulfilled their duties. Goalkeeper Gao Jingwen's skills were also commendable. Shengyou's play lacked vigor.</p>

<p>President Chen's Speech</p>
<p>First, President Chen of this newspaper delivered a brief welcome speech, stating that Mr. Yamamoto is a renowned commentator, thinker, and publishing leader from our friendly neighbor, Japan. The "Kaizo" monthly magazine is one of the best-selling and most comprehensive magazines in Japan. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Kaizo-sha, and Mr. Yamamoto is traveling to China to observe the situation after China's entry into the war. For the past 30 years, Mr. Yamamoto has been a "friend of China" who is most concerned about Far Eastern issues and has done his best to promote friendship between China and Japan. Today, we are introducing him to everyone present, and many of you are old friends of Mr. Yamamoto. I believe you will all be very happy. We also celebrate the limitless future development of Kaizo-sha and wish Mr. Yamamoto good health.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamamoto's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Yamamoto (President) delivered a speech, saying: This is not my first visit to China. I have always had a deep affection for your country. I am very grateful for the invitation from President Chen of your newspaper to have this opportunity to speak with everyone here. The necessity of unity and cooperation between China and Japan</p>
<p>Unity and Cooperation</p>
<p>is not something that started today, especially with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. There is an even greater need for further cooperation. After arriving in your country this time, I am very pleased to see the progress of various facilities. However, in terms of politics, I am not satisfied with this and hope that further efforts will be made. I believe that this hope is not only mine personally, but also that the people of your country will strive for progress. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, we have been working tirelessly to improve ourselves. Not only have we made progress in military affairs and achieved favorable results in the war, but we have also made progress in politics, step by step, along with the progress of the war. After your country entered the war, its mission to share the burden of the overall situation became heavier. I sincerely hope that you will continue to make unremitting efforts and continue to move forward. Moreover,</p>
<p>European War Tensions</p>
<p>at a time when the European war is tense, the German-Soviet war is in full swing, and the battle of Stalingrad in the last war is particularly noteworthy. I believe that the Chinese people have not ignored this point. The future development of the German-Soviet war is something that everyone must pay close attention to. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are land-based powers, each with its own advantages. In countries with equal strength, it will take a fierce battle to determine victory or defeat, and we must pay close attention to it. In this eventful time, it is not easy for China to deal with domestic and foreign problems. To deal with foreign affairs, we must first have a sound and strong political system and gain the support of the people. To strengthen political power, we must strive to improve politics. Once this point is achieved, not only will the people on one side be pleased, but also the people under the rule of the other side will gladly return. I believe that this point needs to be achieved, and I am even more convinced that it can be achieved. Finally, in my 30 years of experience in the cultural field, I would like to briefly describe the fundamentals of cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>The Paper Issue</p>
<p>Japan's paper-making capacity is not much different from before the war. Why, then, are Japan's publishing businesses, newspapers, and magazines seeking to reduce their size? This is because, in this long-term war, we must make preparations in advance so that the tools of the cultural war (paper) can be used endlessly and inexhaustibly, and advance alongside the long-term war, shattering the enemy's paper-based rumor offensive.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Yusheng's Speech</p>
<p>I am not meeting Mr. Yamamoto for the first time today, and I recall that when I first met him half a year ago, it felt as if we had known each other for a long time. This is because Mr. Yamamoto is an old friend of China and is well-versed in China's various situations. He often regrets that China is not his hometown. We all know that he is an authority in the Japanese publishing and cultural circles, and the "Kaizo" magazine he presides over is a world-renowned magazine. His current affairs commentaries, writings, and travelogues are widely welcomed by readers in our country. Because Mr. Yamamoto is a thinker who truly understands China and sympathizes with the Chinese people, I believe that in addition to listening to his high opinions, we should also be open and honest, express our views frankly, and share our innermost feelings. From a political point of view, the future of Japan and China is one of shared destiny. We are fighting a war together with nations that are united in the world and treat us as equals. From a cultural and ideological point of view, the cooperation between China and Japan still needs the active establishment of various cooperative undertakings and efforts to move forward. Ideology is the source of all driving forces. Mr. Yamamoto is not only a proponent of Japanese thought, but also a keen observer of the current situation, and his views are naturally superior to others. I sincerely hope that Mr. Yamamoto's visit will be a long one so that he can observe and experience as much as possible the situation and trends in various aspects of China. The benefits will not only accrue to the Chinese people, but the happiness of the entire East Asia and the world will depend on it.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Huarin's Speech</p>
<p>I had the honor of meeting Mr. Yamamoto at the previous East Asian Literary Representatives Conference. I am very pleased to meet an old friend again today. I recall that when I last met Mr. Yamamoto, I said that I heard that Britain and the United States, in order to feign goodwill towards the Chongqing government, would abolish extraterritoriality and give up concessions in order to deceive the people of Chongqing. If so, why doesn't Japan take the lead in abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions to the National Government? Britain and the United States show goodwill in words, while Japan shows it in deeds. Then, the Chinese people will definitely feel Japan's sincerity in treating us as equals and rise up to cooperate. At that time, Mr. Yamamoto also agreed and asserted that the Japanese government would definitely do this, but it was only a matter of time. In a few days, the Japanese government did realize this. At this point, I realized that Mr. Yamamoto's vision was far-reaching and his observations were accurate. We are aware that our mission is arduous and we are willing to accept constructive criticism with all sincerity in order to achieve a solid foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation. I also hope that Mr. Yamamoto will convey his observations and experiences from this trip to the people of your country after returning home in order to promote the unity of our two countries. Finally, Zhao Zhengping and others delivered speeches, and the gathering ended happily.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic World</p>
<h3>Real Estate and People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>People and land are inherently inseparable. From the perspective of China's private economy, China has been an agricultural country for thousands of years, and the livelihoods of most people depend entirely on the cultivation of land. Even when discussing agriculture and industry together, China has not yet been able to break away from the 19th-century household industry system. Most families rely on both manufacturing and cultivation for their livelihoods. In other words, they cannot break away from the land to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>However, what this topic refers to is not the land relied upon for cultivation in rural areas, but the land in cities that is related to housing issues - it is better to say real estate. In theory, real estate transactions cannot be anything other than a form of investment. Looking at recent Shanghai, since it has been recognized that hoarding goods, especially goods related to people's daily lives, is speculative and illegal, a portion of so-called floating capital has changed its course and flocked to real estate transactions.</p>
<p>It was said above that real estate transactions are legitimate transactions. However, as they are legitimate transactions, one should firmly remember a legitimate principle, which is: in real estate transactions, do not forget the livelihood of the people. Because, as far as we know, some real estate operators, perhaps due to their high level of business skills, do not hesitate to (1) take the demolition of houses as the principle of buying real estate, because they can make a great profit from selling bricks, tiles, and wood; (2) take increasing rent as the motivation for buying real estate, because when real estate changes hands, the houses on the real estate can have new rents set. As a result, the former can directly leave people homeless, and the latter can also increase the burden of living. In addition, some real estate owners even use the power of their money and influence to, on the one hand, divide the unity among tenants, and on the other hand, ingratiate themselves with the powerful, in order to fulfill their desire to evict old tenants and collect new rent, disregarding the issue of people's peaceful and happy life. All of this is unacceptable and are improper and unreasonable behaviors that must be avoided by those engaged in real estate transactions and those who own real estate. In short, one must adhere to the sacred principle of "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Then, operators will operate, and people will live their lives, each not disturbing the other, and the world will be at peace. The Agricultural Economy Department will be established by Jiaotong Bank</p>

<h3>Fundamental Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Although there are many reasons for the soaring prices, speculation and hoarding are the main factors, especially this time. Hoarders refuse to sell, and those without goods desperately try to buy, leading to market chaos and rapid price increases. The impact is far-reaching and detrimental, and the National Government has therefore issued orders for strict investigation. If the investigation cannot be thorough, it will not only fail to suppress prices but will also lead to public disappointment and further fuel price increases. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention, execute the orders fairly, and achieve the intended purpose. Although there have been one or two cases of punishment recently, this cannot be considered complete. It is still necessary to actively promote the investigation so that hoarding is completely unable to escape the law and continue to harm society and satisfy selfish desires. I recently read Mr. Yoshida Togo's "On the Seriousness of the Price Problem," in which he pointed out that speculation and hoarding have political implications. He said: "Shanghai is still the front line of the economic war with Chongqing, and the speculative market is its central battlefield. If the National Government can win this battle, the citizens of Shanghai will become sincere supporters of the National Government. If it fails, the future of the National Government will have significant consequences, and it will be a major blow to Japan's completion of the Greater East Asia War." From this, it can be seen that the seriousness of the problem of speculation and hoarding has reached an extreme point and cannot be ignored by us, and must be suppressed quickly. Moreover, the suppression of speculation and hoarding must not be half-hearted, nor can it be a one-time effort. That is to say, the suppression of speculation and hoarding must not only be thorough in the present but also seek a permanent and fundamental solution. We must not only seek appearance but also seek reality, so that it can be eradicated forever. Therefore, the way to eliminate speculation should be a fundamental solution. In view of this, the author respectfully offers a few countermeasures below in order to fundamentally eliminate speculation and hoarding:</p>
<p>(1) Clearly formulate laws to ban hoarding. The ban on hoarding is not temporary during wartime but permanent. If there are laws to ban hoarding, it will be easier to prevent speculation and hoarding before it happens than to stop it after it has already occurred. As for Mr. Yoshida Togo's proposal, "Punish offenders with death or imprisonment depending on the severity of the circumstances," the author fully agrees, because this is a necessary measure during rampant speculation and hoarding. Otherwise, it will not be enough to deter criminals.</p>
<p>(2) After the investigation, in addition to severely punishing large-scale speculators and hoarders, the remaining hoarded goods can be purchased by the authorities by issuing "commodity warehouse vouchers" at limited prices. This has been discussed in detail in the article "Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" and will not be repeated. In short, the purchase of large stockpiles of goods is another heavy blow to hoarders, because hoarders lose the means to engage in speculation. Moreover, only the method of purchase is effective during rampant speculation and hoarding. Otherwise, the goods will remain in the hands of hoarders. Although there are laws and investigations to suppress them, hoarders can still use various tricks to evade them.</p>
<p>(3) Since there is a National Commercial Control Association, it can be used to handle the purchase of stockpiled goods with the government as a backing. After the purchase is completed, a distribution system should be established as soon as possible to transform the economic structure of Central China from a past state of free laissez-faire to a strict control system. The distribution of various daily necessities must be suitable for the wartime state. However, based on past distribution experiences, there are still several points that officials should pay attention to: First, the distribution quantity should be increased to meet the needs of each individual. Second, the amount needed varies greatly with age, so the distribution quantity must also be specified in detail and differently to show fairness. Third, laborers and mental workers have different levels of consumption and different quantities needed. Therefore, the materials and quantities distributed should also be increased or decreased separately to show appropriateness. Fourth, the stores selling distributed goods should be inspected from time to time to prevent fraud. Otherwise, if shortages cannot be adjusted, the black market will rise again. When the black market rises, it will create opportunities for speculators and weaken the effectiveness of the distribution system. This is because the black market arises because the needs of the people cannot be met.</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Association to Establish Wuhan Branch</h3>
<p>Following the new policy toward China, the economy of the Wuhan area has also undergone considerable changes. Therefore, Lieutenant Colonel Ogawa of the General Command of the Dispatch Army, Military Attaché Kajiwara of the Embassy, Economic Advisor Fukuda of the National Government, Secretary Kiyo of the Embassy, and Secretary Kono of the Ministry of Finance jointly flew to Wuhan on the 5th to inspect the financial situation. On the 5th and 6th, they held a discussion meeting with those related to the Army, Navy, and the Ministry of Greater East Asia stationed in Wuhan at the Consulate General. As a result, it was decided to establish a branch of the National Commercial Control Association in Wuhan.</p>
<p>In the future, all controlled economic institutions that were previously under Japanese control will be handed over to the Chinese side and are currently under study and preparation. Furthermore, a discussion was held with the Chinese banking community on the issue of the Zhongjiang Industrial Bank, which will be registered with the National Government. The group flew back to Nanjing on the 7th. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 9th issue of the Continental News)</p>
<h3>Regulations on Registration of Major Commodities Under Study</h3>
<p>According to Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities, if there is a situation as described in Article 3 of these regulations before the implementation of these regulations, the parties concerned shall register with the local competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations. Article 3 also stipulates that members of major commodity associations who violate orders from the competent authority or the association's rules by concealing and not reporting the commodities they have in stock shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years, and may also be fined not more than 30,000 yuan. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is currently studying the registration regulations, and once the review is completed, the National Government will issue a decree for public announcement.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales Management Office of the Ministry of Food has recently received an order from the Ministry to investigate the black market prices of various items from January to April for review. The office has distributed orders to the various food industry associations to prepare tables and submit them to the Ministry of Food for review.</p>
<p>The Nanshi Chamber of Commerce is taking measures to protect the interests of the business community and strengthen the power of the wartime associations. In addition to urging businesses that have not yet joined trade associations to quickly join, it has also sent letters to various trade associations in the city to request their articles of association, or to have each trade association designate a member in Nanshi to be contacted for application to join each trade association. Currently, the spring silkworms in Zhejiang Province have passed their major sleep stage and are about to spin cocoons. The cocoon market is expected to open in about twenty days. Due to later hatching in Jiangsu Province, the market will open at the end of the month. Silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, and other places have already repaired their silk reeling machines and will resume reeling silk after the spring cocoons come onto the market. However, it is heard that the output of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this spring will inevitably be less than before the war due to the conversion of mulberry fields to other agricultural products.</p>
<p>The New New Co., Ltd. held a shareholders' meeting at the Green Treasure Theater yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, chaired by Mr. Jin Zongcheng. In addition to reporting on the business situation, the meeting also discussed the distribution of this year's profits, resolving to distribute a dividend of 8% and a bonus of 1.1%, and setting May 15th as the date for distribution. The meeting also discussed the increase in capital, resolving to increase the total capital from 3.52 million yuan to 16 million yuan, and to begin the process of subscribing for shares on the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>Mr. Gu's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>It was raining, a gloomy winter. Although it had been light for quite some time, the light filtering into the small house was still extremely dim. The children, fast asleep in the corner, were intermittently snoring. The air was thick with water vapor, mixed with the odor of feet, the smell of urine, and the heat radiating from the bedding.</p>
<p>At this moment, our protagonist, Mr. Gu, had just taken out a bowl and dipped it twice into a pot with a lead ladle when he suddenly realized it was completely empty. He couldn't help but feel slightly annoyed and muttered a quiet curse, "Damn it!" Then, as if struck by inspiration, thoughts flooded his mind: "If only I had five or six dan of rice stored at home..."</p>
<p>Not cooking porridge in the morning wasn't a one- or two-day occurrence, but he never got used to it... Now, after hesitating for a while, he picked up a small clock, exposing it to the faint light. It was already ten past nine. Maybe he should go buy some baked flatbread to eat!</p>
<p>Outside, the wind was howling fiercely, and the noise of people was even more chaotic. Waves of shouting and the sound of the wind shook the doors and windows of the small house. This sound could not but evoke a sense of intimacy in him, possessing great magic. He was gradually captivated by it. He listened carefully, distinguishing the sounds – it was the clamor of people vying to write down numbers… Then, a burst of intense jostling erupted, and suddenly, the back door of the small house burst open, followed by a string of his wife's scolding.</p>
<p>"The Bodhisattva truly ought to..." Opening the rice bag covered with purple handprints while wiping the soles of her shoes on the floor, "No umbrella, no galoshes, soaked in the rain... I must have committed sins in my past life to live such a life!"</p>
<p>The husband stared blankly at her rain-soaked, tangled hair plastered to her face, feeling a heaviness in his heart. He couldn't find words to comfort her for a moment. "What?!"</p>
<p>"Otherwise, he'd be serving you!" Her fiery anger flared at him.</p>
<p>"Don't take it out on me!... I'm asking you, is that old man across the way in? Go buy me some baked flatbread!" He fumbled, tossing her five jiao, a torn banknote.</p>
<p>"Hmmph!" This only fanned the flames of her anger even more. "Don't put on such airs! I'm not a servant girl. Squeezing rice, grinding flour, cooking meals... Now, even buying a piece of baked flatbread, I have to do it. Can't your feet move? Do they hurt? Are they swollen?"</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, I'm not wrong!" This time he became anxious, beginning to mutter incoherently. "Our family will never get better. Harmony brings wealth! But what about us? Arguing and fighting all day long..."</p>
<p>"Harmony!" his wife said sarcastically, a scornful smile appearing on her face. "Treating people like servants is harmony!" She spat.</p>
<p>"..." He mumbled a string of words, unable to think of a suitable retort. His heart was in turmoil, like boiling water in a teapot surging with angry waves. Yet, it was empty, unable to find anything. Finally, with a long sigh, he stepped out of the dark little house—his hunched back silhouette flickering.</p>
<p>Having reached the back door, he hesitated again. Outside, heavy rain was pouring down, and the water spout on the side was dripping loudly. The water flow was rapid, creating a forceful impact.</p>
<p>"I certainly need a coat; it's so cold!" Leaning against the door frame, he gazed at the trees lining the lane—the howling northwest wind violently shaking them, leaving their trunks bare. He involuntarily shivered and began to yearn for his coat, filled with endless emotion...</p>
<p>It was only four months ago when, by the machinations of some devil, a strange idea struck him and found a confidante. It seized his heart, holding on tightly and refusing to let go.</p>
<p>"Come... tell me, if I hide the coat in a trunk, will it produce money?" One evening, he called his wife over, his eyes gleaming strangely. He traced patterns on the table with his finger and asked:</p>
<p>"Hmm!" She stared blankly at his face. Why would her husband ask her such a strange question? How could a coat produce banknotes? What a joke!</p>
<p>"Then, will large copper coins produce small copper coins?" He drew two circles on the table, a small one close to a big one.</p>
<p>"..." His wife was stunned by his question.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, do you understand hoarding goods?" Thus, he began to elaborate on the new theory recently incorporated into his life philosophy. Under the dim yellow light, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth for the first time. Although it was still a bitter smile, it radiated immense ambition and hope! "Those who understand the times are exceptional individuals. In this day and age, muddleheadedness won't lead to success… A coat hidden in a trunk won't produce money, but if you exchange it for money to use as capital – after all, banks allow us to take out loans – and buy goods to hoard in the warehouse, in a few days, it will produce small copper coins... In short, I've decided to sell the coat! When winter comes and we need to wear it, we'll have already made money and can buy a new one!"</p>
<p>His wife was completely conquered by his grand theory. Initially, she listened quietly, allowing his theory and hope to gallop through her heart. Then, her own hopes began to stir and throb. Finally, she joined the charge into the vast plain: "But a coat can fetch five or six hundred, at most. Let's sell that big fur robe too! Anyway, with money, we can buy a new one!"</p>
<p>"In that case, you have to promise me!" She turned around, wiping the grime of coal dust off her face with a black hand, intending to make coal balls. Suddenly she remembered, she earnestly asked: "After we get the money, buy me a pair of galoshes. When it rains, my broken leather shoes always leak!"</p>
<p>"Ha..." The husband slammed his hand on the table and laughed loudly: "Why buy galoshes? I'll buy you a pair of leather shoes to wear as you please!"</p>
<p>Having made the decision, he sold the coat and fur robe to the director of the storage department, earning a thousand odd dollars. After much hardship, he persuaded the manager to agree to a two-thousand dollar loan! Thus, a consignment of white Vaseline was moved into the warehouse.</p>
<p>Reality is a cunning fox. As speculation soared, Mr. Gu's heart bloomed with flowers of hope. At that time, who would have guessed that the Pacific War would break out? A shocking storm swept through Shanghai, destroying the blooming flowers. Rumors flew through the streets, that the bank's warehouse had confiscated a lot of mercury, claiming it was military supplies, and that several consignments of Vaseline had been seized, also claiming it was military supplies.</p>
<p>"Just when we got our hands on it, such bad luck had to happen. Others eat the white of the belly, we can't even get the duck's ass!" Mr. Gu sighed and lamented, sinking into a dark abyss. He used all his skills, squeezing into circles of people he never approached, trying to gather information, desperately planning...</p>
<p>Thinking of this, as if grasping a strong root, he suddenly straightened his body, heading towards the house. The back door slammed shut, showing that this foundation was extremely solid.</p>
<p>"You're a servant! You complain all day! But what am I?" He stood tall at the doorway, speaking mournfully into the darkness, "I toil like a bull or a horse all day long, and for whose sake? I sold my coat, wearing only a thin silk robe, and for whose sake?..."</p>
<p>His wife, sitting on the chamber pot, leaned forward, staring at him with wide eyes—completely bewildered.</p>
<p>"I suffered so much for that consignment of Vaseline..."</p>
<p>"There you go again; go look in the mirror. Your eyes are already sunken, and your complexion looks terribly pale! Why do you always torture yourself! You should relax; wealth and life are linked..." This time, his wife suddenly changed her tone, pulling up her trousers and patting his shoulder to comfort him.</p>
<p>"Wealth and life are linked. Now we're going to lose our lives! Who can I turn to for a thousand dollars?!" His tone changed to a sob.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, the heavens and the Bodhisattva won't mistreat good-hearted people. So many people are hoarding goods, why would they pick on you? When the boat reaches the bridge, it will naturally straighten. There will be a way in the future!" His wife said softly, suddenly remembering something. She glanced at the small clock and exclaimed, "Oh dear! It's already half past nine! They must be writing down numbers now. You need to go to the office!"</p>
<p>"No... it's raining so hard; I'll wait a while!"</p>
<p>"I think you should borrow an umbrella from Grandma next door!" His wife took his arm, leading him out. "I'll accompany you to the tram stop, and I can buy some baked flatbread and squeeze rice along the way!"</p>
<p>Mr. Gu dragged his heavy steps towards the entrance of the office. He grasped the door handle, slowly pushing it open, as if the door was made of iron and required immense strength to open. He listlessly stared at the door, the "Document Section" sign hanging on it swinging, as if mockingly teasing him, laughing at his difficult fate.</p>
<p>"Who do we have here! It's the 'Coat Seller.' What's this, signing in last on the list today!" It was Section Clerk Fan's deep, coarse voice. He leaned against the corner of the writing desk, surrounded by five or six people, discussing some nonsense.</p>
<p>"Nothing much... it's raining." His voice was low, as if stifled.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gu! Your shoulders are wet; did it soak through?" Director Yang asked.</p>
<p>"I'm wearing a silk robe, Director, it won't soak through." Mr. Gu stood still, his tone and attitude completely deferential. After speaking, he carefully weighed his words.</p>
<p>He sat down at his own seat, aimlessly pulling out drawers, wetting his writing brush, at a loss for what to do... He yawned, bent over, and directed his gaze out the window. Above, a gray sky, and raindrops falling rapidly. On the road, four or five puddles, fleeting bubbles - how boring. Thus, he slumped back into his chair.</p>
<p>A series of whispers, mixed with drawn-out chuckles.</p>
<p>"Any news? Did you get ahold of Mr. Yuan?" Storage Section Chief Wu came over and stood behind him, asking.</p>
<p>"Oh! Chief Wu... you're joking," he turned around, whispering softly. The familiar coat flaunted before his eyes, piercing his heart.</p>
<p>"He gave you a big 'hamski,' didn't he? That's how he answered you. Can you tell us about it?" Someone with a clownish face refused to let him go.</p>
<p>"Ha..." ignited a burst of laughter, echoing through the room...</p>
<p>People always seem to enjoy remembering their neighbors' misfortunes. It was only two weeks ago when rumors were spreading that the warehouse was going to be inspected. Colleagues gathered in groups.</p>
<p>"I have a way; we just need to ask our old Mr. Yuan to go and speak a few words!" Mr. Gu lowered his buzzing voice, speaking with an assured tone.</p>
<p>"Why would he run errands for you for nothing? You've got a good plan." People disregarded his opinion, blowing their noses and twisting their mouths.</p>
<p>"We can send him a Jinhua ham, couldn't we?" After pondering for a moment, he spoke up boldly. A Jinhua ham was a heavy gift. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He wondered: would others think the gift was too heavy and ridicule him? According to his original idea, he should have sent a basket of oranges.</p>
<p>"Ha... You want to ask the old man to make a trip for a consignment of Vaseline? You're giving him your entire fortune. At most, you'll just get a cold shoulder! A ham..." The laughter swelled like a wave... infecting everyone.</p>
<p>Now, the laughter rose again! He couldn't help but shudder!</p>
<p>"Malicious thoughts!" Strong jealousy stirred up his heart, and he felt an irresistible impulse within. That consignment of Vaseline was his life, not just worth a few thousand dollars. He had to get that consignment of Vaseline back no matter what, but how could he do it? People were so indifferent, so cruel; no one would pity this small, weak animal. Should he kowtow and beg? Heaven and earth would always be indifferent, indifferent… His world was beginning to shatter and collapse. The emptiness within him expanded infinitely... dissolving his entire being.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you!" Director Yang stood before him like a judge, "The warehouse has been unsealed! But don't get excited!..."</p>
<p>However, he had already jumped up suddenly. A shudder! Something welled up in his throat as if he was about to vomit, his heart about to burst out!</p>
<p>"Unsealed! Really?"</p>
<p>"Take it easy, dozens of consignments of white Vaseline have been moved out!"</p>
<p>"Then, what about mine? Where is it now?"</p>
<p>"It's been discarded somewhere, this is military supplies!" The judge proclaimed his sentence.</p>
<p>"..." He widened his bloodshot eyes, staring at the fat face opposite him. He simply couldn't understand what the sound coming from that big mouth meant.</p>
<p>"Just now, Director Liang asked me to inform you: after you come in, immediately go down to the bank. You have two days to clear the loan!" A large hand patted his shoulder, then swayed away, leaving behind a staggering figure...</p>
<p>Night, the rain drizzling...</p>
<p>The water spout moaned softly, a lonely moan...</p>
<p>The cold wind blowing from the northwest galloped through the air, the sharp corners of tall buildings scraped its wings, provoking angry roars.</p>
<p>These days were filled only with tears, sighs... tears, sighs...</p>
<p>Mr. Gu had just returned from outside, standing blankly in the middle of the small house, his comb drooping like a defeated rooster.</p>
<p>"What did Uncle say? Why are you so silent?" His wife stopped husking corn, asking.</p>
<p>"Only agreed to one thousand." The water droplets hanging on his tangled hair shimmered and fell, he let the rainwater slowly drip into his crooked mouth.</p>
<p>"Interest?"</p>
<p>"Three percent!" He spat out the two words bitterly. Then he resolutely walked to the small bed, knelt down, and pulled out the trunk. Rifling through it...</p>
<p>"What, you're planning to..." His wife stroked two cotton padded jackets: reluctant to part with them: "Aren't they still pretty good? I still want to wear them in the spring!"</p>
<p>"Do you want to live!" The husband rudely snatched the clothes over, "The manager said firmly that if I don't clear the debt in two days, I'll be fired!"</p>
<p>He mumbled and left! The sound of footsteps, stirring the soul, echoed!</p>
<p>"Clothes..." His wife's hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" A look of angry and pleading shot over: "Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying, let's cut out the 'rice' in the future too! Just two meals of corn porridge! In this situation..."</p>
<p>"..." Silently shedding tears, but immediately turned around, clutching the clothes and left!</p>
<p>His wife followed, crying; she stared at his weak, hunched back! --Farther away! Blurred! Devoured by darkness! The dense rain curtain covered her eyes.</p>
<p>The wind roared, heavy rain pouring down, from the small house the children's sleep talk: "Bodhisattva! Where is the Bodhisattva? Mama! I'm unhappy..."</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>— Lu Yang</p>
<p>Don't allow myself to be in my prime,</p>
<p>Life... ravages my youth,</p>
<p>Facing...</p>
<p>My own... face has weathered.</p>
<p>Exploring... the way forward,</p>
<p>A small boat,</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Not... not...</p>
<p>Work cannot ignite the fire of my life,</p>
<p>Pain corrodes my...</p>
<p>Time drives my life,</p>
<p>Towards the... entrance of death.</p>
<p>Gathering my remaining strength,</p>
<p>Stirring up a mere... of life,</p>
<p>Asking the boatman on the river,</p>
<p>Where is the source of hope?</p>
<h3>The Popularization and Vernacular Nature of Poetry</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Hu Mingyang's "Trends in New Poetry," which discusses the lack of development in new poetry, one of the main reasons being its lack of popularization, this is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>To make new poetry universally developed, its language and writing must be as popular as possible. Poetry is learned and refined from the language of the masses. In the past, every great poet was forged and washed in the public. Therefore, a great poet is also a poet of the masses. Poetry is fundamentally for the masses, not just for a small number of scholars and literati. Therefore, it should return to the original path of poetry, which is to give poetry to the masses, convey the "heartfelt voice" of the masses, so that everyone can read and understand it, and finally spread it to every corner of the public, scattered into the hearts of every citizen.</p>
<p>What has Chinese new poetry done in the past twenty-odd years? Just having broken away from the five- and seven-character ancient poems, some jumped into writing sonnets and sestinas. Some advocated free verse and immediately entered the realm of writing obscure, difficult poetry. The biggest shortcoming of Chinese new poetry is the lack of popular language and writing, making it so difficult to understand, frightening people, or so bad that everyone dislikes it. There is no one willing to boldly, frankly, and candidly use popular language. Because the habit of elegance still persists, they end up playing with words. This is one of the biggest problems of Chinese new poetry.</p>
<p>The greatest contribution of the Russian poet Pushkin to his national literature was the use of the vulgar language of the Russian people in his poetry. This most vulgar language, after being selected and recorded by the poet, became a more refined language, and every person felt a deep interest and impression in the poems written in this language. Because of this one achievement, he became the father of Russian literature. The poets of the Renaissance were the same, and the poet Qu Yuan also used local language to write poetry.</p>
<p>Tolstoy once said that he was never satisfied with the performances of the music academy, but one time he happened to hear a peasant singing a folk song passing by his window, which moved him greatly. Gorky also wrote about the same experience. Every art form obtains materials from the public to enrich itself, especially music and poetry. Music takes phrases, while poetry takes language. The only language that is beautiful, refined, and can be used as poetry is the dialect. The resonance of sounds and the depth of content are unique to local languages. Often, when we hear a sentence in a local language, we immediately feel a three-dimensional, transparent power. However, many poets lightly overlook this.</p>
<p>Advocating dialect poetry can make Chinese new poetry spread to every corner. The recitation of poetry is the only way to put poetry on the right path. However, this recitation must be of dialect poetry, otherwise, everyone will not understand it. This loses the meaning of recitation. Therefore, we should not only not be afraid of writing poetry that is popular and easy to understand, but also not be afraid of it being translated into vulgar dialects. Thoroughly develop dialect poetry, local language poetry, until a national common language is produced due to communication, at which time, the poetry written by poets, Chinese new poetry, will be accepted by a wider audience.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must first translate national language poems into dialect poems, translated into Shanghai dialect, Nanjing dialect, Cantonese, Tianjin dialect, Hunan dialect, Hakka dialect, and other local dialect poems. Not only should we translate national language poems into dialect poems, but we must also thoroughly apply local languages, mix into the people, record local languages, select those refined languages, and write them down to create a good poem. We do not hope to be a creator of poetry, but only to be a recorder of poetry. That is to say, no poet dares to say that he can create, he is only recording. And from another perspective, the poetry of language recorded after being selected by the poet's mind is also the poet's great creation!</p>
