<p>社評</p>
<h3>慶祝國府還都三週紀念　吾人應有之反省與希望</h3>
<p>國府還都，荏苒三載，今日國內各地及盟友　邦，紛至慶賀之忱，回想三年前，汪主席及一部份國民黨同志不避艱危，倡導和運，三年來辛苦奮鬥，締造今日之局面，慶祝之舉，當非偶致。我人感覺值得慶祝者有三：</p>
<p>和平運動在三年以前，大多數人抱懷疑戒懼態度，爲無容諱言之事實。國民政府歷經三年間艱苦奮鬥，始終不懈，而有最近日本對華政策之轉變，如廢除不平等條約，交還租界及移交軍管理之　產，在三年後之今日，已證明和運理論之正確，大多數人已移轉共懷疑戒懼之態度，而爲接受與認識。此爲值得慶祝者一。</p>
<p>國府還都之初，僅爲中日政府間之折衝問題，演變迄今，已爲整個東亞與英美清算問題，中國業已參戰，與友邦站在同一戰綫，擊潰英美，且已奠定勝利之基礎。此爲值得慶祝者二。</p>
<p>三年以來，中日兩國政府間固已作種種協力，而雙方民間之了解程度，亦日趨進步，諸如經濟上之合作，文化上之溝通，由此促進兩國之真正親善，成效漸著。此爲值得慶祝者三。</p>
<p>但吾人環顧當前環境，則國土之內，尚有戰爭，未能消除；和平區內，民生疾苦，未能改善，迫切期待解決之問題，正是千頭萬緒，與其謂之慶祝而自滿，毋寗謂爲紀念而警惕，趁此既欣幸而又惶悚之今日，我人願申反省與希望者數事：</p>
<p>（一）和平區內民生疾苦，依然未除，諸如物價高漲，物資缺少，公務人員以　一般薪水階級所受生活壓迫，非言語文字所能形容，日言，「安居樂業」，而實際上爲國家中堅努力之多數人民，有不能維持其最低限度生活之苦難。故今日惟有了解人民疾苦所在，認真實行改善與保障人民最低限度生活之後，國家力量始能真正集中，始能對內言統一自强，對外言協力互助。</p>
<p>（二）文化教育事業，足以培養人民國家意識，與激發人民愛國思想者，人儘知之。三年以來，文化教育事業，常在停滯狀態中，初無進步可言。雖當局側量全力於政治外交，於此稍有偏忽，惟提高國民文化，普吉國民教育，畢竟爲國強民之基本任務，尤爲今後參戰勝利，建國成功，最有力之保障，自宜致力於此。</p>
<p>（三）三年以來，政治體制之建立，似爲遷就一時環境之權宜措置，參戰後始有刷新體制。政治既爲人民大眾之事，在組織民眾，集中人材之前提下，必須建立人民參政之體制，上自中央，下至地方基層機構，必須使人民有參政之機會，以期成爲一現代國家之政體。</p>
<p>（四）本報一月二十七日社評曾建議：「凡重慶政權對於國家與人民之利益，　不能解決之問題，主要者如糧食問題，物價問題，貪污問題，一切有關改善人民生活之問題，希望南京國民政府必須有力量，有辦法，謀求澈底解決。同時，凡重慶政權所言所行而已經失敗者，國民政府決不再蹈其覆轍。」吾人認爲今日值得重複提出，以供當局之反省與檢討。</p>
<p>最後，吾人飲水思源，對於在國府還都以前，開創和運，不避鋒　之　，　示無限之敬意。</p>
<h3>慶賀國府還都紀念　中日滿今交歡廣播　海部在京舉行觀艦式</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　三十日爲國府還都三週年紀念日，值此大東亞戰爭節節勝利之際，中日滿三國東亞軸心，益臻鞏固、日滿兩國爲對於我還都紀念表示慶賀起見、特定三十日晚十時零五分起至十時三十五分止、舉行中日滿三國交歡廣播、我國爲汪兼行政院長、日本方面爲東條首相、滿洲國方面爲張國務總理、</p>
<p>中央社京訊三十日爲國府還都三週年紀念、國民政府特於本日舉行閱兵典禮、主席親自檢閱、聞此次受檢部隊、有中央軍校學生、警衛第二師、航空教導隊等約數千人、屆時並有飛機戰車參加檢閱、閱兵指揮官由首都警備司令半謳一担仟、</p>
<p>南京廿九日中央社電　海軍部　慶祝國府還都三週年紀念、定於三十日下午在京舉行盛大之觀艦式、全國各地之海軍艦隊、均已奉命駛京參加、此次典禮將爲還都以來最盛大而隆重者、中樞長官以及各友邦使節軍　長官等、均將蒞臨、參加艦艇計有　海與、軍艦、「海祥軍艦、「海綏軍艦、「海清、砲艦、「江綏」炮艦、「江清炮艦等三十餘艘、將全體舉行滿艦飾旗、屆時揚子江上、五色繽紛、威容莊肅、將使充滿熱烈情緒之首都、更添一番盛情況、</p>
<h3>南京通訉　「中聯」「東賓」羣星來京紀實</h3>
<p>— 周澤</p>
<p>東賓劇團一行五十餘人，於國長　澤氏之領導下，　於今日（　十五日）翩然蒞京。同行者有中　影星李　華，固　華，襲秋霞，白光，王丹鳳，暨中聯導演黃天始，黃天佐，吳村，徐欣夫，方沛霖等十餘人，車　東站，東賓團員首先下車，整隊站於紫紅色車　之畔，秩序井然，各人胸佩黃綠色紙花一朵，風姿綽約，　神均極飽滿。時中聯　星李麗華擠脫影迷包圍綫，相繼下車，活躍在人　之中。</p>
<p>遊客漸次稀少，中外新聞記者開始活動，開末拉鎂光燈，銀光四飛。剛出月台，鹄侯着的人潮，又洶湧上來，李少泉爲保護女兒而挨到一拳，幸得放沛霖等趕上解圍，護送步上汽車。東賓團員都是健美的少女，因爲不大熟悉，還是言語不通的緣故，人們並不去打擾，大隊人馬搭乘一「巴士」兩　，衝出人羣，弛進大南京的心臟。</p>
<p>不一會，聞記者跟踪到　昌　店的四樓，這是中聯影星休息之所，據李麗　說外　她，脫離影壇也是　　。她並告訴記者，在她秋海棠护　，後　將以東賓爲班底和中聯　　　天　慶呢。</p>
<p>襲秋霞和白光可能是老南京，她們於不久以前都已來過了。她們說一到南京就感到興奮，可是對一般影迷的愛護，倒有些吃不消。</p>
<p>東賓團員住在離福昌飯店不遠的「福田館」，這裏是日本式旅舍，佈置的非常考究，進門就　　到日本風味。據團員小　美島女士說：爲了發揚藝術，爲了慶祝國府還都三週紀念，遠沒重洋　來此公演，是非常感覺高興。她們一行到達上海已有一星期，行　　中聯公司張總經理邀去看了一次共舞　的宏碧緣，劇　是不甚　，倒傾佩中國戲劇的佈景　當偉大的前任，主角非常賣力，　其他配角却好似點綴品，這是和日本戲劇的不同處。她還告訴我們：東賓團員總共是一百五十餘人，這次來中國的一共三十四位，連領隊樂　導演技　等也不過五十多人，這裏都是最優秀份子，她們的教授除足尖舞蹈師是俄人外，全都是日本籍的，者番來華還是第一次，所以這次的演出，要更加的賣力呢。</p>
<p>東賓劇　上演的場址，定在首都第一流的大華戲院，自二十五日期電影已開始停映，內部人頭　動正　製着　置。據說這次上演耗資本幾達　百萬元，所有佈景，因運輸困難，均於南京繪製，演　又不能運往上海，即此一點，所耗資已屬不少。全景統計十幕，均是由專門技師設　配色繪製，現在大致即將竣工。</p>
<p>該團定二十七，二十八兩晚招待軍政要人，二十九日正式獻演，票價計分五十元，三十五元，二十五元，十五元四種，已開始預售，日籍僑民者尤多。聞有一人一次預購五十張者，演出之期，其盛況就可想而知。久已沉寂的首都，又將因「中聯」「東賓」羣星來京而轟動一時了。（三月二十六日寄自南京）</p>
<h3>接收各地日租界　今日舉行交還儀式</h3>

<h3>國府還都三週年紀念日　汪主席告全國國民</h3>
<p>南京廿九日中央社電　國民政府自還都以來，至於今日，已經整整的三週年了。在這三週年的紀念日，我社說些什麽呢？各種政治，軍事，經濟，文化的報告，都有專件，我用不　重複的說，就目前的大事爲友邦日本於本年一月九日訂明交還租界，撤廢治外法權，友邦義大利等繼之，並於今日將蘇州，杭州，天津，漢口，福州，廈門，沙市重慶等處專管租界，實行交還，這是友邦日本援助中國，俾完成其爲獨立國家所必具之條件，這是我們所永永不能忘的。又如自本月十二日起，物資統制有新的規定，這也是友邦日本的援助，俾我們的改善民生，有所着于，這也是我們永永不能忘的。可是我們必須知道今日自國家命脈以至人民生存，都寄託於大東亞戰爭。以上所說兩件大事，也唯大東亞戰爭勝利，才能得到保障。所以當國民政府還都三週年紀念日，我認爲應當第一提出的，無過於怎樣與友邦日本，協力完遂大東亞戰爭，我們當前的任務，以後的工作，都應該無疑無惑的集中於這一點，這是國民政府同人以及一般民眾所應當一致了解的。</p>
<p>當我們參加大東亞戰爭的時候，未嘗不顧慮到我們現在的國力，民力能夠貢獻於大東亞戰爭的究有幾何？能協助日本的究有幾何？然而我們終於毅然參戰，這些問題，友邦日本未嘗不看到，然而友邦日本，也終於欣然贊成我們參戰，這裏頭有一個極重大的意義，一般同胞不可不深切了解。</p>
<p>我們　說，要以東方道義精神，替代西方功利主義，究竞東方道義精神是什麽呢？西方功利主義又是什麽呢？我的解答：欲知道西方功利主義是什麽，只看殖民地主義，便可了然。殖民地主義最顯著的特色是當人做物，只知物質已經是功利主義了。以只知物質之故，將人也當物看待，這真是功利主義之極。則百餘年來集殖民地主義的大成的是盎格魯撤　遜民族吞併了整個美洲和澳洲及大半個非洲，囊括了亞洲的西半，他對於殖民地榨取原料爲最大目的，人亦被視爲原料之一。他榨取人的血汗與榨取樹膏是用同一方法的，只有比榨取的樹膏更加殘酷。他榨取原料之後，爲要製造大量工業品，因而使用機器，他所需要的，一是煤，二是人，他使用人與使用煤也是用同一方法的。使用煤的熱力完了之後，將剩餘的煤渣排出機器以外。使用人的勞力完了之後，人的剩餘身體被排出和煤渣一樣。總而言之，他對於人與對於物是無所區別的。他對於人只知道榨取其勞力，其他一切都不在眼中。他似乎以爲殖民地的人民是沒有人格，沒有意識的，即使有之，於已無益，視爲沒有，惟有勞力却於已有益，可視爲各種動植物原料之一，這真是物質主義之極則，也是功利主義之極則。這種功利主義，結下英帝國繁榮了百餘年，到了大東亞戰爭，方才趨於崩潰，而大英帝國之崩潰，也就是功利主義之賜，因爲他既當人做物，人也就以物自居。他既不要人的人格，人的意識，於是人的人格，人的意識也就永不爲他所用。孟子說的好：「城非不高也，池非不深也，兵甲非不堅利也，米粟非不多也，委而去之，是地利不如人和也」，「委而去之」四個字，將大英殖民地的人民對於大英帝國的心情，簡單扼要的描寫淨盡。大英帝國過去的繁榮，是功利主義之賜，今日的崩潰，也是功利主義之賜。東方道義精神則不然，其與上述的功利主義相反之點，簡單扼要說來，即是孟子所謂，「人和」，對於人不是當做物，而是當做人，人除了身體之外還有精神，除了勞力之外，還有人格，還有意識，尊重其人格意識，使我之精神與人之精神，團結爲一，是之謂人和，所謂東方道義精神，人和二字，可以說盡。現在我們所用的口號是「自愛其國，互愛其鄰，共愛東亞」，若不能自愛其國還有什麽可說，所以第一句是自愛其國，使其人格意識，有所着落，然而在這國家集團時代，單是自愛其國，還不夠的，所以第二句是互愛其鄰，使以其人格意識與其鄰之人格意識相結合，鄰是山近而遠的，所以第三句是共愛東亞。在東亞的範圍內，爲人格意識之團結，先謀共同保衛，使東亞站得住，然後進一步謀所以貢獻於世界之和平，東亞　　聯盟標舉政治獨立，軍事同盟，經濟提携，文化溝通，爲四大綱領，即是根據於此原理。日本爲什麽援助中國　還租界，澈廢治外法權，俾完成其爲獨立國家所必具之條件呢？因爲要滿足中國人之愛國心，完成其與復中華之志願，中國爲什麽當大東亞戰爭開始之際，即聲明與日本同甘共苦，最近且進一步參加大東亞戰爭與日本同生倂死呢？因爲既知自愛其國，便知互愛其鄰，共愛東亞，所以把與復中華與保衛東亞看做一件事，這種舉動，只有以東方道義精神，繞能解答，決不是西方功利主義所能解答。</p>
<p>日本東條首相說的好：「東亞有十萬萬人，這是任何國家集團所不及的，只要這十萬萬人能團結起來」，十萬萬人以其人格意識相團結，是之謂人和。這種人和，不是西方功利主義所能夢到的，以這種同心同德的力量，來與英美離心離德者祥周旋，其必勝不敗，決然無疑。欲知中國之自動參戰，與日本之贊成中國參戰，應當着眼於這一點，然則資源有無的問題如何解答呢？有了人的團結，則人的資源已經具備了。至於　的問題，以物物交換政策代替榨取政策，有無相通，長短相補，人我兩面倂受其益，人和之後，盡人事以與地利，物的資源之收穫，決非以一人做物者，所能及其萬一，那是斷然無疑的，明白了以上所說，則一般同胞對於參戰之決心，必然堅定不搖。</p>
<p>就我個人來講，我對於中日事變之決心，與對於大東亞戰爭之決心，是完全不同的。</p>
<p>我對於中日事變，自始即不願其發生，即使不幸發生，一有可能，即欲使之消滅而歸於和好，因爲中日兩國是不應有糾紛的，即使有糾紛，而冤　宜解不宜結，必須這樣，東亞　能保衛得住。日本自明治維新以來舉其國力民力，站在保衛東亞的最前綫，英美能席捲了非洲澳洲以及西亞，而不能席捲東亞，就因爲有一個日本將他擋住。中國雖然能發奮自強，對於日本已是後起，就保衛東亞的立場來講，後起的中國，只有與先進的日本互相提携，共同保衛東亞，決沒有倒了先進國後，這個後起國反能獨立之理，這是誰都不能否認的真理。日本固然先進國，但既然站在保衛東亞的最前綫，以與英美戰爭，只有盼望站在後方的中國絡繹趕上，共同奮鬥，決沒有回過頭來，向中國趕盡殺戮消耗自己的力量，驅逐自己的伙伴，投向敵人陣營的，這又是誰都不能否認的真理。我在十餘年以前，認定這點，所以在行政院長任內，有了淞滬之戰，即締結淞滬停戰協定，以結束之。有了熱河冀北之戰，即締結塘沽協定以結束之。其後因爲承認所謂何梅協定的責任，以致爲人狙擊，重傷之後，引起舊病，不復能担當行政院長的重任，以致盧溝橋事變，不復能如前此之舉而挽回，這是我生平最抱憾的，事變既起之後，我的主張，被人詆爲民族失敗主義者，其後更不得了，漢奸賣國賊等等污穢名詞，蝟集於我，我一點沒有顧忌，一點沒有退縮，仍然主張中日事變應該速行了結。其後更主張這次的了結，不可如以前淞滬停戰協定等等只一時彌縫，而應該從根本上予以解決，永絕中日過去及現在的糾紛，重建將來的友好基礎。有些人見我反對焦土戰，游擊戰，以爲我的和平主張，是茍且的，姑息的，這是完全誤解了我的主張，是中日不宜有糾紛，即有冤仇，亦宜解不宜結，中日兩國，不應該將國力用在互相仇殺上面，而應該將國力聯合起來，對付共同的敵人。以上的和平主張，到了大東亞戰爭而面目顯然了。大東亞戰爭是大東亞全民族生死存亡的戰爭，如果失敗的話，所有的東亞民族就只有與非洲澳洲以及西亞的民族同一命運，絕對沒有逃出英美手心的希望。中國既然是東亞一部份的土地，中國的民族既然是東亞一部份的人民，那末，中國只有參加大東亞戰爭，日本站在大東亞戰爭的最前綫，中國就只有從後方絡繹趕上，共同奮鬥，所謂同甘共苦，同生共死，其意義是非共苦無以求同甘，非共死無以求同生，這和中日事變的性質，完全不同。中日事變是自始即不盼望其有，既有之後，只有盼望其復歸於無。大東亞戰爭則不然，百年以來就知道這一場戰爭，是不能免的，中國如果想從英美掌心裏解放出來，不再做　　他的次殖民地，只有大東亞戰爭勝利才可得到。不惟中國，所有的東亞民族如果不想隨非洲澳洲以及西亞諸民族之後，只有求之於大東亞戰爭勝利，百年以來，所知道終有此一日的，果然有此一日，我們除了以共苦求共甘，以共死求同生，實在再沒有第二條路。明白了以上所說，則中國參戰之後應當怎樣，也就可以瞭然了，大東亞戰爭是大東亞全民族的戰爭，所負的東亞民族都應當以其力量加入總力戰。我們知道我們今日的力量是微弱的，但是我們要努力不斷，以微弱的力量加入總力戰裏頭，我們能貢獻得一分是一分，我們如果不能積極的，以我們的力量貢獻於總力戰，以加強總力戰，我們即是消極的削弱總力戰，同時我們知道，我們能不斷的貢獻其力量。就是能不斷的增長其力量，譬如我們加一担於肩上，担的重量能一天天的增加，就是證明我們的力量能一天天的增加，力量不是在我們身外飛來的，而是我們心中發出的，如果我們以勇猛精進刻苦耐勞的精神，從事於總力戰，將見我們團體的組織，因此而益精密，我們團體的紀律因此而益修明，我們個人的聰明智慧，以及技能動作，也因此而深沉益活潑，所謂用進廢退是一切有機體的必然現象，我們絕不可因國力不足而自暴自棄。</p>
<p>說到這裏有一點須詳加闡明，所謂總力戰，其內容不只是軍事力量而是心力物力的一切，軍事力量之外，政治力量，經濟力量，文化力量，都包括在裏頭。我們應該集中全中國的心力物力使之適當分配於政治軍事經濟文化各部門，同時又要集中政治軍事經濟文化各部門的力量以用之於大東亞戰爭。這裏頭，物的資源，暫時不必說，先說人的資源，所謂人的資源，還要將數　與質量，分析來說，論到數量，中國有四萬萬多人，這是可以自負的，可是論到質量，　我們的缺點太多了，百年以來，我們同胞，受英美政治的壓迫，軍事的侵奪，經濟的剝削，這些都是有形的，而文化的麻醉，使我們同胞，在思想方面，不知不覺忘記了自己，這些無形的荼毒較之有形的，厲害何止萬倍，我們要打倒英美的勢力，先要肅清了各人胸中的英美思想，這是我們從事大東亞戰爭的第一要務，也就是總力戰的第一要着。怎樣　能肅清呢？要打倒別人，先要建立自己，新國民運動，便是所以建立自己的，我們必須知道，所謂新，不單是新發生之謂，滌其舊染之污，還其本來面目，也謂之新，國父孫先生的遺教，傳自孔子所叮嚀教誨的，是要我們做成一個中國人，做成一個東亞人，這些都是多年以來被英美思想所蒙蔽了的。即如所謂國際主義，即是從英美思想所孕育而成，他們自詡要做成一個人，做成一個現代的人，這些未嘗不說得好聽，可惜把做成一個中國人，做成一個東亞人忘記了，就粗細來說，英美所辦的學校，表面上是爲中國教育人才，其實是以宗教思想，來消滅國家思想。</p>
<p>要使中國人根本忘了自己是中國人，並且忘了自己是東亞人，在功課方面，連國民應受的訓練，也不要提起，在享受方面，却提倡個人樂利，使人人爲所陶醉，把國家民族的痛苦，一概忘了，其結果爲共匪所　，所以孕成共匪思想者，特別以英美所辦的學校爲多，這是眾所周知的事實。就細微來說，自命爲智識階級的人們，以英美之毀譽爲毀譽，以英美之是非爲是非，英美要中國人忘記了自己，他們却進步要中國人唾棄了自己。例如唾棄儒教，使中國人看不起自己的文化；唾棄祖宗，使中國人看不起自己的血脈，於是小而家庭，大而社會，以至整個國家民族，都在根本上發生了舍己從人的動搖。其結果，遂致重慶方面，甘於做英美的走狗，來反噬東亞的同胞，真是可爲痛哭。新國民運動的建立自己，就是對於以上的荼毒而加以救治，其所急急的，是要做成一個中國人，一個東亞人，至於其爲現代的進步的中國人東亞人，那是不成問題的，決不會疑心到我們　古我們開倒車，因爲凡是一個生物都會吸收滋養料，以謀自己的生存發達，現代的科學，以至一切進步的事物，都是最好的滋養料，我們只要能建立自己，不患不能吸收，不患不能消化，我們能建立自己，做成一個中國人東亞人，我們自然能建立自己做成一個現代的進步的中國人東亞人。反之，我們如果不能建立自己，那麼我們只能算是一塊死肉，不能吸收人，只能被人吸收，我們惟有　力做成一個中國人東亞人，一個現代的進步的中國人，東亞人，才能使中國在大東亞戰爭中，成爲數量質量兼備的人的資源，才能成爲東亞全民族總力戰的一個重要單位。</p>
<p>以上所說是中國參戰以後第一重要工作。也就是根本工作，在思想上，建立自己排除過去英美的一切麻醉作用，這根本工作在最短期間，必須完成，至於其他心力，如組織紀律聰明才力等等，以及一切物的資源，如何生產開發，如何集中使用，那是屬於專門的，今日不及一一詳說了。</p>
<p>最後還有一句話，在大東亞全民族總力戰中，我們不能忘記重慶方面大多數被桎梏的同胞，我們必須把他們解放出來，使之和我們站在一起，但是那些執迷不悟的，我們不復能認之爲同胞，只能認之爲英美的走狗，我們要不姑息不妥協約打倒英美完遂大東亞戰爭之目的，則對於這些英美的走狗，也要不姑息不妥協約予以打倒。</p>
<p>慶祝國府還都，要：</p>
<p>（一）厲行節約消費；</p>
<p>（二）努力增加生產；</p>
<p>（三）完遂大東亞戰爭；</p>
<p>（四）實現大亞洲主義。</p>

<h3>德國的決戰態勢　集中總力於生產</h3>
<p>柏林廿日特電</p>
<p>早春已臨柏林，陽光漸轉暖和，本月一日遭英空軍轟炸之後，街上尚散亂着商店櫥窗的玻璃片，閃爍耀眼，到處正在整理崩坍的家屋及收拾屍骸。冬季以來，局勢大變，在此新情勢中，德國政府迅速頒布了男女勞動令，商店封閉令等，迄今已逾一個月半，現在已到既定期限。名副其實的德國，正舉國家一切所有，集中於戰爭，表現着澈底的總動員姿態。市街的面貌，國民日常的生活，都已一變，首都柏林的大街，改變得更加有趣。</p>
<p>兵隊慰藉力謀萬全</p>
<p>因着商店封閉令，街上首先關閉的酒館等，其招牌正在一塊一塊的卸除下來，街上走着的男子，則所見的只有外國人而已。汽車也完全看不見了，出租汽車已自二月一日起禁止營業，不得已而必須使用時，須向近處警察申請。那天空襲之後，被毀的商店櫥窗，都在裝配新木框，把小塊的玻璃片一塊一塊拼起來，造成應急的「戰時櫥窗了，所謂美觀，體裁，什麽都不管。無論到什麽地方，都以兵力爲第一。歌劇場，戲院，電影院，都設有雙人座，以備兵士們休假回來，得和他們的妻子或愛人同座觀賞。柏林的　奧車站旁邊，新設了一所專供兵士進　的電影院，兵士於上下車之際，如須等待若干時間而覺得無聊時，可以入內觀賞電影消遣。</p>
<p>在弗利德和希街的車站旁邊，也有一所劇場，於每夜十一點鐘到翌晨五點鐘，開演有趣的時事劇，以供上下車的兵士們觀樂。不用說，這些戲院和劇場，都是免費的。像這類的設施，不久將普及於全國的車站。</p>
<p>編成少年防空兵</p>
<p>德國新近動員十四歲至十八歲的少年，編成了少年防空兵。穿着灰色制服的這羣可愛的防空兵，在街上隨處可以見到。他們被採用而作爲防控補助兵，收容於兵舍內，天天受訓練。兵舍裏還有學校的先生也參加着，一星期內對於那羣少年防空兵，要教以半星期學科。</p>
<p>由於頒佈可男女勞動令，德國的勞動力總動員，就此着着進展。尤其是因爲婦女多被動員之故，在凱隆市裏的小菜舖，一星期二次要到軍需工廠裏去擺攤頭，以供在這裏做工而沒有工夫出外買菜的婦女們，購買菜蔬及其他食品。這種辦法成績很好，不久全國似乎都要實施，同時似將發展至　同舉炊的形式。</p>
<p>身上的用品也大大起了變化。洋服的新添置，已完全禁止，先前的定貨也都徹底命令停製，只許修補破舊的。經售織品，襪類，汗衫等的百貨店，也不以販賣百貨爲專業，介紹顧客與修理工傷而從中取點佣錢爲主務了。但是爲減省修理工人的人手起見，主婦等都被招集到一定的講習會，教以雷器，火爐，自來水，傢具，壁紙等的修理法。婦女的染髮，修指甲等，當然是禁止的，至於電燙頭髮，爲節省時間和電力起見，也加禁止了。但因爲柏林有着許多的外國婦女，所以雷燙頭髮還有一部份被許可。在美容院裏化　着許多時間的婦女們，手裏都須做那修補兵士破滅的工作。</p>
<p>電力煤氣的節約</p>
<p>關於電力和煤氣的節約，辦法很爲嚴重，現在規定於本年八月三十一日以前，禁止出售十瓦特及二十伏特以上的電燈泡，不過，像醫院啦，受到轟炸之害的地方啦，當然是有例外的。本年二月十八日，軍需部長休貝亞頒布法令，嚴令實行一般之電力節約，如有超過所定之量者，除從嚴科罰外，且公布其姓名，使世人知其爲擾亂安寧者。（丁：譯自三月二十二日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>澳門通訊　重慶政權之荷捐雜稅（一）　增稅名目繁多結果未達預期數額</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>重慶政權拖戰結果，財政金融上，已至無法支持之地步。但尚圖以增稅方法，作最後掙扎，結果實收稅額，往往未如預期所得，開源仍無辦法。茲將增稅情形，分述如次：</p>
<p>（一）推廣轉口稅稅類</p>
<p>稅域</p>
<p>轉口稅本爲一種內地關稅，其性質爲通過稅，足以阻碍貨物流通，凡民船，鐵路，公路，輪船，航空，郵政，運送之貨，除扣征統稅及烟酒稅者外，凡經海關及分卡時均征轉口稅，又所有在國內運送之土貨，無論由何處起運及到達何處，在設有海關暨海關分卡地點裝卸或經過者，均須轉口稅。稅率仍爲值百抽五至七五、並未提高。據海關統計，轉口稅收廿六年爲二千萬另二十餘萬元，二十七年五千五百八十四萬餘元，增加一倍餘。二十八年四千六百六十六萬餘元，二十九年增至六千三百八十餘萬元，三十年一月至十月份收達已達八千七百六十餘萬元，較二十六年增多三倍有奇。</p>
<p>（二）提高印花稅稅率</p>
<p>二十六年十月十一日公佈非常時期印花稅暫行辦法。要點爲：（一）發貨票銀鈔貨物收據賬單，原定稅率係自三元起貼，現改爲一元起貼，即滿一元貼一分，滿三元者貼二分，滿十元者貼四分，滿百元者貼六分。（二）賬薄，原稅法定每年每冊貼二角，照非常時期暫行辦法應貼四角。（三）原稅法十六條規定每件憑證所貼印花最高不得超道二十元，現此規定　予刪除。（四）呈文，申請書，訴願書，保結等以後典賣不動產契據列入課稅之列，並加重漏稅罰　．</p>
<p>例如二十六年度印花稅預算列一千一百三十萬元，實收僅四百六十九萬五千一百十一元。二十七年度預算五百六十五萬元，實收亦祗二百五十九萬五千六百二十二元。較預算短少百分之五四·〇五。三十八年度預算四百萬元，實收四百五十五萬另四百二十三元，雖較預算增收百分之十三，而比二十六年度收數仍短少百分之一。二十九年度預算仍爲八百另二萬二千四百二十六元。三十年度印花稅收再增至一千另八十四萬元一千四百六十七元，恢復平時收數。</p>
<p>（三）提高煙酒稅率</p>
<p>烟酒二項，在稅收上之地位，僅次於關盥统三穜，爲良好税源。二十六年十月十三日公布「土酒加征與舉辦土烟絲稅辦法」，將土酒稅率提高五成，而土烟絲稅則規定每凈量一百斤，徵國幣二元另七分五厘。二十六年度烟酒稅預算原列二千四百七十六萬七千五百二十四元，實收一千四百四十五萬五千四百三十八元，約合預算之半數。二十七年度預算一千另五十二萬三千三百二十一元，實收八百六十二萬五千六百三十六元。二十八年預算一千七百三十一萬三千三百三十四元，實收一千八百三十四萬五千八百七十三元，超過預算約百分之六，二十九年預算一千六百五十萬元，實收再增至二千四百三十九萬三千四百七十七元。三十年度一至六月份計收八百六十九萬二千另另三元。</p>
<p>（四）擴大統稅區域</p>
<p>除原征統稅區域外，並將雲南，新疆，西康，青海等省一律劃爲統稅區域，惟此數省本非工業發達之區，稅收自屬不多。統稅稅類以前計爲捲於，麥粉，火柴，水泥，棉紗，薰烟，火酒，啤酒共八項。於廿九年七月十二日復先後開征飲料品，糖類統稅兩種，規定應征飲料品統稅之貨品計有汽水類，果子露類，蒸餾水三種，分級征收稅率爲百分之廿，糖類統稅，依照糖統征收暫行條例規定，分（一）紅藕，（二）糖，（三）白糖，（四）冰糖，（五）方糖塊糖，（六）糖精，（七）其他糖類，經過核定者，稅率百分之十五，統稅之稅類遂由八種擴充至十一類。據統計，糖類統稅一項開征後，半年內稅收已達九百三十五萬四千八百二十九元。</p>
<p>各項統稅二十六年統稅預算列一萬七千六百三十一萬三千九百零五元，實收三千零零三萬六千六百九十一萬元，僅及預算百分之十七，二十七年預算八千七百八十萬八千八百二十五元，實收一千五百六十一萬零零五十三元，約合預算百分之十七，七七，短收仍鉅。二十八年預算三千二百四十三萬零一百十四元，實收三千零八十五萬零六百四十八元，約佔預算數百分之九十五·一六。二十九年預算一千八百八十一萬元，實收四千六百三十七萬一千四百六十一元，比二十六年實收數增百分之五十四。三十年實收九千三百餘萬元較二十六年增收二倍有餘，比二十九年增加一倍有餘。</p>

<h3>讀者論壇　人材與人情</h3>
<p>— 徐玉瑋</p>
<p>不論是擇衛國土的武器，造福人羣的工具，供人欣賞的藝術作品，其成功的階段，必須經過創造·改造·製造三個步驟。推動這三個步馬戲的原動力，人力與物力，固是不可缺少的條件，但「人材」的頇要，尤爲當務之急。</p>
<p>我們翻開中外歷史，看到許多先賢哲士，爲了創造或改進一種事業，往往傾家蕩產，刻苦自勛；置生命於度外，視榮利爲醜惡；雖百折而不撓，成功而不驕，失敗不自餒，殫精竭智，寗願齊志以歿，不移初衷，其忘私從業和精神和堅忍不拔的毅力，足爲萬流景仰，永世楷模，給後人失敗者一個敎訓，誰說不可，所以社會進展，建設事業，不但需要「人材」，而須具備「毅力」。</p>
<p>但，事實上，在現社會中，風起雲湧的產生着大量企業機構，（包括銀行，企業，保險……等組織）其錄用大批從業人員，何苦都是「量才器使」，雖其中不乏「人材輩出」，然「才具平庸」，恐也佔有相當的數額。我們天天祇見報紙的封面上鱗次櫛比的登載着各種企業機構「開幕」與「開業」的廣告，却不見「招考」與「甄選」職員的消息，這樣不能不令人懷疑着何來大批從業人員？還不是以「八行書」的「人情」舖成了他們進身之階。</p>
<p>運用「人情」安插私人，原是中國社會史乘中傳統的觀念，不過檢點以往，似乎多少欲蓋彌彰，而透視現狀，竟有以認若干股錄用若干人員爲交換條件者，以及今日交情濃則取之，明日交情淡則去之的種種怪現象滋生在現實的社會上。所以，實際上除了不得已選用蔑個「內行」或「兜得轉」的人員點綴外，其他的可說「兄弟姊妹皆列土」，可置「人材」於不顧，「人情」則不可却。因此各種機構的營業範圍，也祇限於「交情」中施展他的技倆，不想在合理的技七上打算。</p>
<p>雖然，「人情」是賢者多情之雅，就是國家制定的嚴竣法律，有不外「人情」的說法，似乎不可厚非；但，濫用「人情」，不特影響事業本身，且也辜負國家一番苦心孤詣培植「人材」的本旨，同時不免使有「學富五車」兼備毅力的「人材」，感到「懷才不遇」，甚至阻遏有志向學者希圖上進的萌念。何况「人情」有失去的一日，各種機構的石基，大批從業人員之職位，誰能担保「安如磐石」。</p>

<h3>課論　中儲券的今後課題</h3>
<p>日本當局於三月二十四日發表，定於四月一日起停止發行軍　新鈔，除香港海南島之外華中華南所有軍票，預備漸次收回。停止特別圓匯兌換算率。但並不因此項新方針而立即消滅軍票之流通，依然成人軍票的繼續流通及軍票債權，債務，以期順利推進中儲券的行使。此項辦法實施後，預料經過某一個時期，中儲券即能取軍票而代之，成爲華中華南的唯一法定通貨，流通於一般市上。既有此種關係，則今後將由軍票儲券並用時代以達將來儲券一色時代。故中儲券所負的使命確屬重大。</p>
<p>中國事變發生後，昭和十二年十一月起，軍票所創的功績頗大。軍票所做的工作，最顯著的莫過下面三點；爲推進戰爭而作爲軍部之支出貨幣，戰後通貨混亂時代的唯一可　流通貨幣，對抗渝方通貨反攻工作的鬥爭手段。促進敵性通貨舊法幣的崩潰，助成中儲券的發展，這都是軍藥所建的功勞。要使中儲券將來發展到代替軍票的階段，仍惟有軍票支援它，才有成功的可能。</p>
<p>中儲券的一色化一旦實現，中儲券還得要借中國本身的經濟力，政治力，大家努力加強自己。加強中儲券這件工作，僅靠通貨金融工作是不可能的，必須鞏固中國全面的政治力，與經濟力。目下渝方破壞中儲券非常積極，新四軍又發行新券來侵奪中儲券，所以爲了加強中儲券，必須排除這種經濟反攻，更須積極的造成攻擊敵性通貨的力量。中儲券用自力來強化自己，是今後中儲券的重要課題之一。</p>
<p>第二，特別圓制度廢止後，中日貿易，已能由中儲券直接和日圓結成一塊來進行。華北與華中間的交易，向來以日圓爲媒介的辦法，也告廢止，而由中儲券與聯銀券直接結算。代表日圓的軍票沒有了以後，所以通貨價值不同的通貨，當然用直接結算辦法。在某一種場所或某一個時期，在結算上或許有若干困難，應當怎樣來處理呢？這種對外的問題，是今後中儲券的重要課題之二。</p>
<p>要是不能妥善解決這二個內外課題，那就談不上中儲券的實際強化。用怎樣的措置，應該怎樣入手，還望中國經濟當局深思熟慮，毅然推動。（雲鵬：譯自三月二十九日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>全國商業統制總會　辦理紗布存貸登記　限於本月底前辦理完竣</h3>

<p>全國商業統制總會漢口分會，近正在積極籌備成立中，預計離正式成立之期當不爲遠。聞此次籌備工作，係以市商會爲中心進行。</p>
<p>還都紀念　總會休假</p>
<p>今（三十）日爲國府還都三週紀念日，本市各界，均舉行慶祝儀式，海關郵局一律放假，停止辦公一天，故該會事務所，今（三十）日亦隨同休假一天，停止收發申請許可書證。</p>
<h3>保險監理局　擬整飭內地保險業</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　實業部保險監理局，自成立以來，對於滬市保險業之整理，不遺餘力，全市保險公司向該局申請登記，經核准執業者，計有九十七家，其餘未准登記之保險公司，均不得開業，據悉該局將於本月底結束登記事宜，此後新創立之保險公司，均不准登記開設，并聞該局以滬市保險事業，已整理納入正規，擬進一步整理內地保險業，將派員前往蘇州·杭州·等地，督促整飭保險業公會，對於各地保險公司，或分支店代理店，均須依法登記。</p>
<h3>華中煙草組合　執行限價買賣</h3>
<p>華中烟草配給組合實施本埠捲烟配給，其第一批派貨已於本月二十五日分配於各批發商（即大同行），限四月二日以前前往提貨，各零售商（小同行）可憑卡向指定之大同行出貨，隨繳工部二　物品捐。聞首批派貨均爲軍管理之願中烟廠及日商中華烟公司等出品，下期派貨即以國烟居多，辦法仍問，茲悉組合方面規定各捲烟店對配給之貨，不得在短期間內售罄，必須啣接下期配貨，以防各店作弊，故今後市民向大小捲烟店購買捲烟，在數量上將受限制，惟各己領得派貨之經售捲烟商，竟有企圖囤積行爲，若干商店在門市酌予限價發售數小時外，並沒人限購一二小包，並強迫購買搭購其他雜牌捲烟，竟有整天拒絕門售等情，聞該組合得報後，除派昌澈查外，並與當局商妥制裁辦法，以維捲烟公定限價，而免奸商囤積居奇。</p>
<p>又悉，自全國商統會成立，捲烟不列入統制物品以內之後，搬運方面，已不受限制，本埠烟商，且可將捲烟運往外埠，祗須報關，不必再辦其他手續，故近來客銷方面，異常鬆動，但因各店批發，類多停頓，寗波路烟兌公會市場，又告停閉，故欲購貨者，頗感困難，即同業與同業之間，亦多實行物物交換。</p>

<h3>中國商業銀行之今昔觀（四）：</h3>
<p>— 兼之</p>
<p>若再就銀行存款在通貨中所處之地位而論，則中國本與歐美不同。在歐美票據之制服，均大於實幣之支付三四倍，故銀行存款在通貨中所處之地位，至爲重要。至在中國，除通商大埠外，仍以實幣爲最重要之支付工具，銀行存款所產生之票據，僅屬次要。事變以後，銀行存款在通貨中所處之地位，更形減退，中國十一家銀行之存款，自二十五年至三十一年，不過增加一倍，而同時期舊法幣發行額之增加，雖無正確數字公佈；但最少數倍於從前。況日本佔領區內，復有各種新貨幣之流通，故實幣實際之增加，當至足驚人。所以中國通貨之膨脹與收縮，與歐美不同，以實幣爲主要之原動力，而以事變後爲尤甚。</p>
<p>不過此種實施，迄今尚爲一般所忽視，仍依舊傳統之觀念，認爲現在經濟之不安定，由於金融之不安定，而金融之不安定，復由於商業銀行之不自重，自從當局規定銀行存款，交準備房款，有限制咸以爲即可一切安定，殊不知現在經濟恐慌之本質，已有根本之變遷。事變初起，金融之安定，重於一切，及外滙猛縮，經濟之安定，仍以金融爲樞紐；但自儲備券全面實施以後，經濟重心，已非復爲金融，而爲物資之生產與分配。如物資之生產與分配無確實可行之辦法，則不論金融之措置如何，其效果至爲有限。倘辦理欠週，引起社會之恐慌心理，則金融本甚安定，反滋紛擾，影響大局。且前已言之，在目下中國紙幣流通遠較票據爲廣，故現在金融大權可云全在中央儲備銀行之手，爲安定金融之重鎮，商業銀行殘存之實力，幾有無足輕重之情形，自無過分加以統制之必要。當局應從增加生產與物資圓滑分配等大處着手，則庶可納經濟於正軌，爲社會造福利焉。</p>
<p>以上所論，雖對於現在中國商業銀行之分析，爲一結對悲觀論者。不過此種經濟之畸形趨勢，必爲戰時之一時現象。俟經濟安定，大部游資仍將重行集中於銀行，使銀行資力逐漸恢復，地位復趨重要。銀行之機能，雖難免有暫時之變動；但其本質之固定性，固無從動搖之也。（完）</p>

<h3>Reflections and Hopes on the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Three years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital. Today, people from all parts of the country and allied nations are sending their congratulations. Recalling three years ago, Chairman Wang and some Kuomintang comrades, undeterred by difficulties and dangers, advocated peace. Through three years of hard work and struggle, they have created the current situation. This celebration is not accidental. We feel there are three things worth celebrating:</p>
<p>The peace movement, prior to three years ago, was met with skepticism and apprehension by most people, which is an undeniable fact. Through three years of arduous struggle and unwavering commitment by the National Government, the recent shift in Japan's policy towards China, such as the abolition of unequal treaties, the return of concessions, and the transfer of military-administered properties, has proven the correctness of the theory of peace. The skepticism and apprehension of most people have been replaced by acceptance and understanding. This is the first thing worth celebrating.</p>
<p>The National Government's return to the capital initially involved only negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments. It has since evolved into a settlement issue involving the entire East Asia region, including England and the United States. China has joined the war, standing on the same front as its allies to defeat England and the United States, and has laid the foundation for victory. This is the second thing worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, the Chinese and Japanese governments have cooperated in various ways, and the level of understanding between the people of both countries has also been progressing daily. Economic cooperation and cultural exchange have gradually promoted genuine friendship between the two countries, yielding noticeable results. This is the third thing worth celebrating.</p>
<p>However, looking around at the current environment, there is still war within the country that has not been eliminated. The people in the peaceful areas are suffering and their livelihoods have not been improved. The urgent problems awaiting solutions are numerous and complex. Rather than being complacent with celebration, it is better to commemorate with vigilance. On this day of both joy and trepidation, we would like to express several reflections and hopes:</p>
<p>(1) The hardships of the people in the peaceful areas remain unresolved. The soaring prices, shortage of supplies, and the living pressures faced by civil servants and salaried workers are indescribable. Although the phrase "live and work in peace" is often used, the majority of people who work hard for the country, the backbone of the nation, are suffering because they cannot maintain their minimum standard of living. Therefore, only by understanding the people's suffering and earnestly implementing measures to improve and guarantee their minimum standard of living can the strength of the nation be truly concentrated. Only then can we speak of internal unity and self-strengthening, and external cooperation and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>(2) Cultural and educational undertakings are sufficient to cultivate people's national consciousness and inspire patriotism, as everyone knows. Over the past three years, cultural and educational undertakings have often been in a state of stagnation, with no progress to speak of. Although the authorities have devoted all their efforts to political and diplomatic affairs, and may have neglected this aspect, raising national culture and popularizing national education are, after all, fundamental tasks for strengthening the country and its people. They are also the most powerful guarantees for future victory in the war and success in nation-building, and should be committed to.</p>
<p>(3) Over the past three years, the establishment of the political system seems to have been an expedient measure to accommodate the temporary environment. Only after joining the war has the system been refreshed. Since politics is a matter for the general public, a system of popular participation in politics must be established on the premise of organizing the people and concentrating talent. From the central government to the grassroots organizations at the local level, people must have the opportunity to participate in politics in order to become a modern nation-state.</p>
<p>(4) This newspaper's editorial on January 27th suggested: "For the sake of the interests of the country and the people, the Chongqing regime has been unable to solve the major problems such as food, prices, corruption, and all issues related to improving people's lives. We hope that the Nanjing National Government must have the power and means to seek a thorough solution. At the same time, the National Government must never repeat the mistakes that the Chongqing regime has made." We believe that it is worth reiterating this today for the authorities to reflect on and review.</p>
<p>Finally, as we drink the water, we remember its source. We express our infinite respect to those who pioneered peace before the National Government returned to the capital, undeterred by the dangers.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital: Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Goodwill Broadcast; Naval Review Held by Admiral Kaibu in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The 30th marks the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital.

<h3>Nanjing Correspondence: A True Record of the "China United" and "East Wing" Stars Coming to Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ze</p>
<p>The East Wing Theatre Troupe, a group of over 50 people, led by Director Zawa, gracefully arrived in Nanjing today (the 15th). Accompanying them were China United movie stars Li Lihua, Gu Lan, Xi Qiuxia, Bai Guang, Wang Danfeng, and China United directors Huang Tianshi, Huang Tiansuo, Wu Cun, Xu Xinfu, Fang Peilin, and others, totaling more than ten people. At the train station, members of the East Wing troupe got off the train first, standing in formation beside the crimson carriages, in orderly fashion. Each person wore a yellow-green paper flower on their chest, looking elegant and full of energy. Then, China United star Li Lihua broke through the crowd of fans and got off the train, actively mingling with the crowd.</p>
<p>As the number of tourists gradually decreased, Chinese and foreign reporters began to move around, turning on their flashbulbs, sending silver light flying. Just as they exited the platform, a crowd of people surged forward again. Li Shaoquan was punched while protecting his daughter, but fortunately, Fang Peilin and others caught up to help break the siege, escorting them onto the car. The East Wing troupe members were all healthy and beautiful young women. Because they were not very familiar with the language, people did not bother them. The large group boarded one "bus" and two cars, broke through the crowd, and sped into the heart of Nanjing.</p>
<p>Before long, reporters tracked them down to the fourth floor of the Fuchang Hotel, where the China United movie stars were resting. According to Li Lihua, she has also left the film industry. She also told reporters that after the "Qiu Haitang" event, she will use East Wing as the base and China United to...Tian Qing.</p>
<p>Xi Qiuxia and Bai Guang are probably old Nanjing hands, as they have both been here before. They said that they felt excited as soon as they arrived in Nanjing, but they were a little overwhelmed by the love of the fans.</p>
<p>The East Wing troupe members stayed at the "Fukuda Inn," not far from the Fuchang Hotel. This is a Japanese-style inn, decorated very exquisitely. As soon as you enter, you can feel the Japanese flavor. According to Ms. Komishima, a member of the troupe: "In order to promote art and to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we have come here from afar across the ocean and feel very happy." They arrived in Shanghai a week ago. During the journey, General Manager Zhang of the China United Company invited them to see "Hong Bi Yuan," a dance drama. They did not quite understand the drama, but they admired the scenery of Chinese drama as a great predecessor. The protagonist performed very hard, but the other supporting roles seemed to be ornaments, which is different from Japanese drama. She also told us: "The East Wing troupe has a total of over 150 members. This time, 34 people came to China, including the leader, music director, and acting coach, totaling only more than 50 people. These are all the most outstanding members. Their professors are all Japanese, except for the ballet teacher who is Russian. This is their first time coming to China, so they will work even harder in this performance."</p>
<p>The performance venue for the East Wing Theatre Troupe has been set at the Dahua Theatre, the first-class theatre in the capital. Since the 25th, film screenings have been suspended, and people inside are busily preparing the sets. It is said that this performance costs nearly one million yuan. All the scenery was drawn in Nanjing due to transportation difficulties. The performances cannot be transported to Shanghai, so the costs have been quite high. The entire scene is divided into ten acts, all designed, colored, and drawn by specialized technicians. It is now nearing completion.</p>
<p>The troupe has scheduled to host military and political dignitaries on the evenings of the 27th and 28th. The official performance will be on the 29th, with ticket prices ranging from 50 yuan, 35 yuan, 25 yuan, and 15 yuan. Advance sales have already begun, with many Japanese residents buying tickets. It is said that one person bought 50 tickets at once. The grand occasion of the performance can be imagined. The long-silent capital will once again be sensationalized by the arrival of the "China United" and "East Wing" stars. (Sent from Nanjing on March 26th)</p>

<h3>The National Government's Third Anniversary of Returning to the Capital: Chairman Wang Addresses the Nation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today marks the full third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. What should we say on this third anniversary? Reports on various political, military, economic, and cultural matters are available separately, so I will not repeat them. Regarding the major events of the present, Japan, our friendly nation, agreed on January 9th of this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Italy and other friendly nations followed suit, and today, the specialized concessions in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shashi, Chongqing, and other places are being returned. This is Japan, our friendly nation, assisting China in completing the necessary conditions to become an independent country, something we must never forget. Furthermore, starting from the 12th of this month, new regulations for the control of resources have been implemented. This is also assistance from Japan, our friendly nation, aimed at improving our people's livelihoods. This is also something we must never forget. However, we must realize that today, the nation's lifeline and the people's survival are both entrusted to the Greater East Asia War. The two major events mentioned above can only be guaranteed with victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, I believe the most important thing to propose is how to cooperate with Japan, our friendly nation, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Our current task and future work should undoubtedly be focused on this point. This is what the National Government and the general public should unanimously understand.</p>
<p>When we participated in the Greater East Asia War, we could not help but consider how much our current national strength and people's strength could contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and how much we could assist Japan. However, we finally resolutely joined the war. Japan, our friendly nation, has seen these problems, but Japan, our friendly nation, finally gladly approved of our participation in the war. There is a very significant meaning to this, which all compatriots must deeply understand.</p>
<p>We say that we want to replace Western utilitarianism with the Eastern spirit of righteousness. What exactly is the Eastern spirit of righteousness? What is Western utilitarianism? My answer: To know what Western utilitarianism is, just look at colonialism and you will understand. The most prominent feature of colonialism is treating people as objects, only knowing material things. This is already utilitarianism. Because of only knowing material things, people are also treated as objects. This is the extreme of utilitarianism. For over a hundred years, the Anglo-Saxon nations, who have compiled the great achievements of colonialism, have annexed the entire Americas and Australia, as well as most of Africa, and seized the western half of Asia. Their greatest purpose for the colonies is to extract raw materials, and people are also regarded as one of the raw materials. They extract people's blood and sweat in the same way they extract tree sap, only more cruelly. After extracting raw materials, they use machines to produce large quantities of industrial goods. What they need is coal and people. They use people and coal in the same way. After the heat of the coal is used up, the remaining slag is discharged from the machine. After people's labor is used up, the remaining bodies of the people are discharged like coal slag. In short, they make no distinction between people and things. They only know to extract labor from people, and everything else is ignored. They seem to think that the people of the colonies have no personality or consciousness, and even if they do, it is useless to them, so they treat them as if they don't exist. Only labor is useful to them and can be regarded as one of the raw materials from various animals and plants. This is the extreme of materialism and the extreme of utilitarianism. This utilitarianism has resulted in the prosperity of the British Empire for over a hundred years, but with the Greater East Asia War, it is now tending towards collapse. The collapse of the British Empire is also a gift of utilitarianism, because since they treat people as objects, people also regard themselves as objects. Since they do not want people's personality or consciousness, then people's personality and consciousness will never be used by them. Mencius said it well: "The city is not high, nor is the moat not deep, nor are the weapons and armor not strong and sharp, nor is the grain not abundant, but they are abandoned. This is because the advantages of the land are not as good as the harmony of the people." The four words "abandoned and left" simply and concisely describe the feelings of the people of the British colonies towards the British Empire. The past prosperity of the British Empire was a gift of utilitarianism, and its current collapse is also a gift of utilitarianism. The Eastern spirit of righteousness is different. Its point of contrast with the above-mentioned utilitarianism, simply and concisely put, is what Mencius called "harmony of the people." People are not treated as objects, but as people. In addition to the body, people also have a spirit. In addition to labor, they also have personality and consciousness. Respecting their personality and consciousness, uniting my spirit with the spirit of others, this is called harmony of the people. The so-called Eastern spirit of righteousness can be summed up in the two words "harmony of the people." The slogan we use now is "Love your country, love your neighbors, love East Asia together." If you cannot love your own country, what else is there to say? Therefore, the first sentence is to love your country, so that your personality and consciousness have a place to settle. However, in this era of national groups, it is not enough to simply love your own country. Therefore, the second sentence is to love your neighbors mutually, so that their personality and consciousness can be combined with the personality and consciousness of their neighbors. Neighbors are those who are close in the mountains and far away. Therefore, the third sentence is to love East Asia together. Within the scope of East Asia, we must first seek common defense for the unity of personality and consciousness, so that East Asia can stand firm, and then further seek to contribute to world peace. The East Asia League advocates political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication as its four major principles, which are based on this principle. Why does Japan assist China in returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, so that it can complete the necessary conditions to become an independent country? It is because it wants to satisfy the patriotism of the Chinese people and fulfill their desire to restore China. Why did China, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, declare that it would share weal and woe with Japan, and recently even further participate in the Greater East Asia War and live and die with Japan? It is because knowing to love one's own country, one knows to love one's neighbors mutually and to love East Asia together. Therefore, restoring China and defending East Asia are seen as one and the same. This kind of action can only be answered with the Eastern spirit of righteousness, and it is definitely not something that Western utilitarianism can answer.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said it well: "East Asia has one billion people, which no other national group can match. As long as these one billion people can unite." One billion people are united in their personality and consciousness, which is called harmony of the people. This kind of harmony of the people is something that Western utilitarianism cannot even dream of. With this power of unity of purpose and action, to deal with those in England and America who are divided and lack virtue, victory is assured and defeat is impossible. To understand China's automatic participation in the war and Japan's approval of China's participation in the war, one should focus on this point. Then how should the problem of resource availability be answered? With the unity of people, the resources of people are already available. As for the problem of materials, replace the policy of extraction with a policy of barter, sharing what one has with what one lacks, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, so that both sides benefit. After the harmony of the people, do everything possible to cooperate with the advantages of the land. The harvest of material resources will definitely not be what someone who treats people as objects can achieve even one ten-thousandth of. This is absolutely certain. Understanding what has been said above, the determination of all compatriots to participate in the war will definitely be firm and unwavering.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, my determination regarding the Sino-Japanese War and my determination regarding the Greater East Asia War are completely different.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, I did not want it to happen from the beginning. Even if it unfortunately happened, I wanted to eliminate it and return to harmony as soon as possible, because China and Japan should not have disputes. Even if there are disputes, grudges should be resolved rather than fester. It must be like this for East Asia to be able to be defended. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has used its national strength and people's strength to stand on the front line of defending East Asia. England and America were able to sweep through Africa, Australia, and West Asia, but they could not sweep through East Asia, because there was a Japan blocking them. Although China can strive to become strong on its own, it is a latecomer to Japan. From the standpoint of defending East Asia, the latecomer China can only cooperate with the advanced Japan to jointly defend East Asia. There is no reason for this latecomer country to be able to become independent after the advanced country falls. This is a truth that no one can deny. Japan is indeed an advanced country, but since it stands on the front line of defending East Asia, fighting against England and America, it can only hope that China, standing in the rear, will continuously catch up and fight together. There is no reason to turn around, slaughter China to exhaust its own strength, drive away its partners, and throw itself into the enemy's camp. This is another truth that no one can deny. I recognized this point more than ten years ago. Therefore, during my tenure as President of the Executive Yuan, after the Battle of Shanghai, I concluded the Shanghai Truce Agreement to end it. After the Battle of Rehe and Northern Hebei, I concluded the Tanggu Agreement to end it. Afterwards, because of admitting responsibility for the so-called He-Umezu Agreement, I was sniped and seriously injured, which triggered old illnesses. I was no longer able to bear the heavy responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan, which led to the Lugouqiao Incident, and I was no longer able to reverse the situation as before. This is what I regret most in my life. After the incident, my claims were slandered as the national defeatism. Afterwards, it was even worse, with filthy terms such as traitor and sellout converging on me. I did not care at all, I did not retreat at all, and I still insisted that the Sino-Japanese War should be ended quickly. Afterwards, I further insisted that this settlement should not be like the previous Shanghai Truce Agreement and other temporary measures, but should be fundamentally resolved to permanently eliminate the past and present disputes between China and Japan, and rebuild the foundation of future friendship. Some people saw that I opposed the scorched earth strategy and guerrilla warfare, and thought that my peace claims were expedient and appeasing. This is a complete misunderstanding of my claims. It is that China and Japan should not have disputes. Even if there are grudges, they should be resolved rather than fester. China and Japan should not use their national strength to kill each other, but should unite their national strength to deal with the common enemy. The above peace claims became clear with the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a war of life and death for all the peoples of Greater East Asia. If it fails, all the East Asian peoples will have the same fate as the peoples of Africa, Australia, and West Asia, and there is absolutely no hope of escaping from the hands of England and America. Since China is a part of the land of East Asia, and the Chinese people are a part of the people of East Asia, then China can only participate in the Greater East Asia War. Japan stands on the front line of the Greater East Asia War, and China can only continuously catch up from the rear to fight together. The meaning of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together, is that without sharing woe, there is no way to seek sharing weal, and without dying together, there is no way to seek living together. This is completely different from the nature of the Sino-Japanese War. The Sino-Japanese War was not hoped for from the beginning. After it happened, it was only hoped that it would return to nothing. The Greater East Asia War is different. For a hundred years, we have known that this war cannot be avoided. If China wants to liberate itself from the palms of England and America and no longer be their semi-colony, it can only be achieved with victory in the Greater East Asia War. Not only China, but all the East Asian peoples, if they do not want to follow in the footsteps of the peoples of Africa, Australia, and West Asia, can only seek it from victory in the Greater East Asia War. For a hundred years, we have known that this day would come. Now that this day has finally come, we really have no second way except to seek sharing weal through sharing woe, and to seek living together through dying together. Understanding what has been said above, one can understand what China should do after participating in the war. The Greater East Asia War is a war of all the peoples of Greater East Asia, and all the East Asian peoples should add their strength to the total war. We know that our strength today is weak, but we must work hard and continuously add our weak strength to the total war. We can contribute as much as we can. If we cannot actively contribute our strength to the total war to strengthen the total war, then we are passively weakening the total war. At the same time, we know that we can continuously contribute our strength, which means we can continuously increase our strength. For example, if we add a load to our shoulders, the weight of the load can increase day by day, which proves that our strength can increase day by day. Strength does not fly from outside our body, but comes from our heart. If we engage in the total war with a spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and endurance, we will see that our group organization will become more precise, our group discipline will become more refined, and our individual intelligence, wisdom, skills, and actions will also become more profound and lively. The so-called use it or lose it is the inevitable phenomenon of all organisms. We must never abandon ourselves because of insufficient national strength.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, there is one point that needs to be explained in detail. The so-called total war is not just military strength, but everything including mental strength and material strength. In addition to military strength, political strength, economic strength, and cultural strength are all included. We should concentrate all of China's mental and material strength and appropriately distribute it to the political, military, economic, and cultural sectors. At the same time, we must concentrate the strength of the political, military, economic, and cultural sectors to use it in the Greater East Asia War. Here, we do not need to talk about material resources for the time being. First, let's talk about human resources. The so-called human resources must also be analyzed in terms of quantity and quality. When it comes to quantity, China has more than 400 million people, which is something to be proud of. But when it comes to quality, we have too many shortcomings. For a hundred years, our compatriots have suffered from the oppression of Anglo-American politics, the invasion of military forces, and the exploitation of the economy. These are all tangible. The intoxication of culture has made our compatriots forget themselves unknowingly in their thoughts. These intangible poisons are more than ten thousand times more powerful than the tangible ones. To defeat the power of England and America, we must first eliminate the Anglo-American thoughts in everyone's minds. This is our first priority in engaging in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first step in the total war. How can we eliminate it? To defeat others, we must first establish ourselves. The New Citizen Movement is the way to establish ourselves. We must know that the so-called new is not only about something newly created. Washing away the dirt of old habits and restoring the original appearance is also called new. The teachings of the Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, which were passed down from the exhortations and teachings of Confucius, are to make us a Chinese person, to make us an East Asian person. These have been obscured by Anglo-American thoughts for many years. For example, the so-called internationalism is nurtured by Anglo-American thoughts. They boast of making a person, of making a modern person. These may sound nice, but they forget about making a Chinese person, making an East Asian person. To put it bluntly, the schools run by England and America are superficially for educating talents for China, but in reality, they use religious thoughts to eliminate national thoughts.</p>
<p>To make the Chinese people fundamentally forget that they are Chinese, and even forget that they are East Asian, they do not even mention the training that citizens should receive in their courses. In terms of enjoyment, they promote personal pleasure, making everyone intoxicated, and forgetting all the pain of the country and the nation. As a result, the communist bandits took advantage. Therefore, those who nurtured communist bandit thoughts were particularly found in schools run by England and America. This is a well-known fact. To put it subtly, those who consider themselves intellectuals take the praise and criticism of England and America as their own, and take the right and wrong of England and America as their own. England and America want the Chinese people to forget themselves, but they are even more eager for the Chinese people to despise themselves. For example, despising Confucianism makes the Chinese people look down on their own culture; despising ancestors makes the Chinese people look down on their own bloodline. As a result, from small families to large societies, and even the entire country and nation, have undergone fundamental shifts in abandoning oneself to follow others. As a result, Chongqing is willing to be a running dog of England and America, biting back at East Asian compatriots. It is truly worthy of a cry of pain. The New Citizen Movement's establishment of oneself is to treat the above-mentioned poisons. What is urgently needed is to make a Chinese person, an East Asian person. As for being a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person, that is not a problem. We will never doubt that we are admiring the ancients or reversing the car, because every living thing will absorb nutrients to seek its own survival and development. Modern science, and all progressive things, are the best nutrients. As long as we can establish ourselves, we do not have to worry about not being able to absorb them, and we do not have to worry about not being able to digest them. We can establish ourselves, make a Chinese person, an East Asian person, and we can naturally establish ourselves, make a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person. On the contrary, if we cannot establish ourselves, then we can only be considered a piece of dead meat, unable to absorb people, but only able to be absorbed by people. We can only strive to make a Chinese person, an East Asian person, a modern and progressive Chinese or East Asian person, so that China can become a human resource with both quantity and quality in the Greater East Asia War, and become an important unit in the total war of the entire East Asian nation.</p>
<p>What has been said above is the most important work after China's participation in the war, and it is also the fundamental work. Ideologically, establishing oneself and eliminating all the past Anglo-American intoxications. This fundamental work must be completed in the shortest possible time. As for other mental strengths, such as organization, discipline, intelligence, and talent, as well as all material resources, how to produce and develop them, and how to concentrate and use them, those are professional matters, and I will not go into detail today.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more sentence. In the total war of the entire East Asian nation, we cannot forget the majority of compatriots in Chongqing who are in shackles. We must liberate them and make them stand with us. But those who are obsessed and do not wake up, we can no longer recognize them as compatriots, but only recognize them as running dogs of England and America. We must not appease or compromise, and we must achieve the goal of defeating England and America and completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we must also not appease or compromise and defeat these running dogs of England and America.</p>
<p>To celebrate the National Government's return to the capital, we must:</p>
<p>(1) Vigorously practice thrift and reduce consumption;</p>
<p>(2) Strive to increase production;</p>
<p>(3) Complete the Greater East Asia War;</p>
<p>(4) Realize Pan-Asianism.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces in Southern Tunisia: The Strategic Defense Ultimately Failed; Axis Forces Still Plan to Move to New Positions; Italian Division Commander General Bissola Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – There was fighting at various points on the Tunisian front on Sunday. The Allied forces attempted to encircle the Axis forces in southern Tunisia again, but they were met with fierce resistance and counterattacks by the Axis forces, and failed. The Axis forces adopted mobile tactics and moved to new positions according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas) – Berlin reports that although the Allied forces on the southern front in Tunisia were numerous, Rommel's forces were successful in combat, and the enemy forces have been stopped. However, the German forces on the Mareth Line are on the defensive. According to Allied reports, the pressure of the British and American forces on the northern, central, and southern routes of Tunisia is gradually increasing. On the northern route, the British First Army has launched an offensive in the Djebel Abiod area. The German side admits that a part of the British Eighth Army has temporarily broken through the German defense line in the El Hamma area. Another part of the Eighth Army is attacking the Mareth Line from the side. However, the breach was quickly filled by the German forces. According to broadcasts from Algiers, the British Eighth Army has advanced to the suburbs of El Hamma. As for the American forces east of Maknassy, the German side claims that they initially occupied important high ground, but after fierce fighting, they were defeated by the German Blitz Division. The fighting has now come to a standstill. On the central route, the American side announced that they have occupied the town of Fondouk, about ten miles from Pichon. However, the Axis forces claim that the American offensive towards Kairouan has completely failed. On the southern front, the command of the separatist French forces claims that the French forces are fighting in the Chott area and have made slight progress along the southern bank.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Haiyong News Agency) – It was announced here that Italian Division Commander General Bissola has been killed in action in Tunisia.</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Sharpen Their Swords and Prepare for a Large-Scale War; Soviet Forces in the Central Route Form an Arc-Shaped Formation; German Aircraft Bomb Soviet Rear Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow last night, the eastern front, from Orel in the north to the Black Sea in the south, including the salient west of Kursk, has been quiet for five months of intense fighting. The Red Army's winter counteroffensive can be said to have come to an end. The belligerent countries are both preparing for everything behind the front line. As soon as the snow melts and the ground dries, they will launch large-scale military operations. Mechanized units will be dispatched to participate in the future war. The German Air Force has changed its target and is now bombing the Red Army's rear transportation lines.</p>
<p>Soviet border area, 29th (Havas News Agency) – The battle situation in various areas on the eastern front is divided as follows: (1) In the Smolensk province of the central route, according to Moscow news, the Red Army has attacked the main German positions. General Konov's Red Army is still trying to connect the Red Army in the Bely area with the Red Army in the Kolm-Zhigovsky area on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Dnieper River. Therefore, the central front, from forty miles northeast of Smolensk, through the Vyazma-Smolensk railway to the Sukhinichi-Smolensk railway, forms an arc shape. According to foreign news reports, the strategy adopted by the German army in the central route has changed.

<h3>Germany's Decisive Battle Posture: Concentrating All Strength on Production</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Early spring has arrived in Berlin, and the sunlight is gradually becoming warmer. After being bombed by the British Air Force on the first of this month, pieces of glass from store windows are still scattered on the streets, glittering dazzlingly, and collapsed houses are being cleared and corpses are being collected everywhere. Since winter, the situation has changed drastically. In this new situation, the German government quickly issued labor decrees for men and women, shop closure orders, etc., and more than a month and a half has passed since then. The real Germany is now concentrating everything it has on the war, showing a thorough mobilization posture. The face of the city and the daily lives of the people have all changed. The streets of the capital Berlin have changed even more interestingly.</p>
<p>Striving for Perfection in Soldiers' Comfort</p>
<p>Due to the shop closure order, taverns and other establishments were the first to close on the streets, and their signs are being removed one by one. The only men seen walking on the streets are foreigners. Cars are also completely invisible. Taxi services have been prohibited since February 1st. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, you must apply to the nearby police. After the air raid, the destroyed shop windows are being fitted with new wooden frames, piecing together small pieces of glass to create makeshift "wartime windows." Aesthetics and style are ignored. Everywhere, military strength is the priority. The opera house, theaters, and cinemas all have double seats, so that soldiers can enjoy performances with their wives or loved ones when they return on leave. Next to the (unclear character) Au Station in Berlin, a cinema has been newly built specifically for soldiers to enter. Soldiers who have to wait for a certain amount of time when getting on or off the train and feel bored can enter to watch movies for entertainment.</p>
<p>Next to the station on Friederichstrasse, there is also a theater that presents interesting current affairs plays every night from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM for soldiers getting on and off the train to enjoy. Needless to say, these cinemas and theaters are free. Facilities like these will soon be widespread at stations across the country.</p>
<p>Forming Juvenile Anti-Aircraft Troops</p>
<p>Germany has recently mobilized teenagers aged fourteen to eighteen to form juvenile anti-aircraft troops. These lovable anti-aircraft soldiers, wearing gray uniforms, can be seen everywhere on the streets. They are employed as anti-aircraft auxiliary soldiers, housed in barracks, and trained every day. Teachers from schools also participate in the barracks, teaching the teenage anti-aircraft soldiers half a week of academic subjects per week.</p>
<p>Due to the issuance of labor decrees for men and women, the total mobilization of the German labor force has progressed steadily. Especially because many women have been mobilized, the vegetable shops in Cologne must set up stalls twice a week in military factories to provide women who work here and do not have time to go out to buy groceries with vegetables and other food. This method has worked very well, and it seems that it will soon be implemented nationwide. At the same time, it seems that it will develop into a form of joint cooking.</p>
<p>There have also been major changes in personal items. The new addition of Western-style clothing has been completely prohibited, and previous orders have been completely ordered to be stopped. Only repairs of old and broken clothes are allowed. Department stores that sell fabrics, socks, undershirts, etc. no longer specialize in selling department store items. They introduce customers to repair workers and take a commission as their main task. However, in order to reduce the number of repair workers, housewives are gathered at certain lectures to be taught how to repair thunderbolts (electric appliance, possibly a slang term), stoves, tap water, furniture, wallpaper, etc. Of course, women's hair dyeing and manicures are prohibited. As for perming hair, it has also been prohibited to save time and electricity. However, because there are many foreign women in Berlin, some perming is still permitted. Women who spend a lot of time in beauty salons must do the work of repairing soldiers' broken items.</p>
<p>Saving Electricity and Gas</p>
<p>The methods for saving electricity and gas are very strict. It is now stipulated that the sale of light bulbs with more than ten watts and twenty volts is prohibited before August 31 of this year. However, hospitals and places affected by bombings are, of course, exceptions. On February 18 of this year, Minister of Military Affairs Speer issued a decree strictly ordering the implementation of general electricity savings. Those who exceed the prescribed amount will be severely punished and their names will be announced to the world so that people know that they are disturbing the peace. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 22)</p>
<h3>Macau Correspondence: Heavy Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies of the Chongqing Regime (1) – Numerous Tax Items, Results Fail to Meet Expected Amounts</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>As a result of the Chongqing regime dragging out the war, its finances and economy have reached a point where they can no longer be sustained. However, it is still trying to use tax increases as a last resort. As a result, the actual tax revenue often does not meet the expected amount, and there is still no way to increase revenue. The situation of tax increases will be described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting the Expansion of Transit Tax Categories</p>
<p>Tax Area</p>
<p>The transit tax is essentially an inland customs duty, its nature is a passage tax, which is sufficient to hinder the circulation of goods. All goods transported by civil ships, railways, highways, steamers, aviation, and postal services, in addition to deducting consolidated tax and tobacco and alcohol tax, are subject to transit tax when passing through customs and sub-stations. Moreover, all domestic goods transported within the country, regardless of where they originate and where they arrive, are subject to transit tax when loading or unloading or passing through places with customs and customs sub-stations. The tax rate remains at 5 to 7.5 percent of the value and has not been increased. According to customs statistics, transit tax revenue was just over 20 million yuan in 1937, over 55.584 million yuan in 1938, more than doubling. In 1939, it was over 46.66 million yuan. In 1940, it increased to over 63.8 million yuan. From January to October of 1941, revenue reached over 87.76 million yuan, more than tripling compared to 1937.</p>
<p>(2) Increasing Stamp Tax Rates</p>
<p>The Interim Measures for Stamp Tax During the Emergency Period were promulgated on October 11, 1937. The main points are: (1) For invoices, silver notes, goods receipts, and bills, the original tax rate started at three yuan, which is now changed to start at one yuan, that is, one cent is levied for every full yuan, two cents for every three yuan, four cents for every ten yuan, and six cents for every hundred yuan. (2) For account books, the original tax law stipulated that two jiao should be levied per book per year, but according to the interim measures during the emergency period, four jiao should be levied. (3) Article 16 of the original tax law stipulated that the maximum stamp tax affixed to each certificate should not exceed 20 yuan, but this provision is now deleted. (4) Petitions, applications, appeals, guarantees, and other documents, as well as deeds for the sale of real estate, are included in the taxable items, and the penalties for tax evasion are increased.</p>
<p>For example, the stamp tax budget for 1937 was listed as 11.3 million yuan, but the actual revenue was only 4,695,111 yuan. The budget for 1938 was 5.65 million yuan, but the actual revenue was only 2,595,622 yuan, a shortfall of 54.05 percent compared to the budget. The budget for 1939 was 4 million yuan, but the actual revenue was 4,550,423 yuan, an increase of 13 percent compared to the budget, but still 1 percent less than the revenue in 1937. The budget for 1940 remained at 8,022,426 yuan. In 1941, stamp tax revenue increased again to 10,841,467 yuan, restoring the usual revenue level.</p>
<p>(3) Increasing Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Rates</p>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol are second only to customs duties and consolidated taxes in terms of tax revenue, making them a good source of tax revenue. The "Measures for Additional Levy on Local Wine and Implementation of Local Tobacco Tax" were promulgated on October 13, 1937, increasing the local wine tax rate by 50 percent, while the local tobacco tax stipulated that 2 yuan and 7.5 fen should be levied for every 100 jin of net weight. The original budget for tobacco and alcohol tax in 1937 was listed as 24,767,524 yuan, but the actual revenue was 14,455,438 yuan, about half of the budget. The budget for 1938 was 10,523,321 yuan, but the actual revenue was 8,625,636 yuan. The budget for 1939 was 17,313,334 yuan, but the actual revenue was 18,345,873 yuan, exceeding the budget by about 6 percent. The budget for 1940 was 16.5 million yuan, but the actual revenue increased again to 24,393,477 yuan. From January to June of 1941, 8,692,003 yuan was collected.</p>
<p>(4) Expanding the Consolidated Tax Area</p>
<p>In addition to the original consolidated tax area, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai, and other provinces were all designated as consolidated tax areas. However, these provinces are not industrially developed areas, so tax revenue is naturally not high. Previously, the consolidated tax categories included cigarettes, wheat flour, matches, cement, cotton yarn, smoked tobacco, spirits, and beer, totaling eight items. On July 12, 1940, two new consolidated taxes were successively levied on beverages and sugar. The goods subject to the consolidated tax on beverages included soft drinks, fruit syrups, and distilled water, with tax rates levied in tiers at 20 percent. The consolidated tax on sugar, according to the Interim Regulations on the Collection of Consolidated Tax on Sugar, was divided into (1) red lotus root, (2) brown sugar, (3) white sugar, (4) rock sugar, (5) cube sugar, (6) saccharin, (7) other types of sugar. The tax rate, after verification, was 15 percent. The consolidated tax categories were thus expanded from eight to eleven. According to statistics, the tax revenue from the consolidated tax on sugar alone reached 9,354,829 yuan within half a year after its implementation.</p>
<p>The consolidated tax budget for all items in 1937 was listed as 176,313,905 yuan, but the actual revenue was 30,036,691 yuan, only 17 percent of the budget. The budget for 1938 was 87,808,825 yuan, but the actual revenue was 15,610,053 yuan, about 17.77 percent of the budget, with a large shortfall. The budget for 1939 was 32,430,114 yuan, but the actual revenue was 30,850,648 yuan, about 95.16 percent of the budget. The budget for 1940 was 18.81 million yuan, but the actual revenue was 46,371,461 yuan, an increase of 54 percent compared to the actual revenue in 1937. In 1941, the actual revenue was over 93 million yuan, more than doubling compared to 1937 and more than doubling compared to 1940.</p>

<h3>Reader's Forum: Talent and Sentiment</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuwei</p>
<p>Whether it's a weapon to defend the country, a tool to benefit humanity, or a work of art for appreciation, its successful stages must go through three steps: creation, modification, and manufacturing. The driving force behind these three stages – manpower and material resources – are indispensable conditions. However, the need for "talent" is particularly urgent.</p>
<p>When we open the pages of Chinese and foreign history, we see many sages and wise men who, in order to create or improve a career, often emptied their family fortunes and practiced self-discipline; disregarded life and death, viewed fame and gain as ugly; persevered despite setbacks, were not arrogant in success, and not discouraged in failure; exhausted their wisdom, preferring to die with their ambition fulfilled rather than change their original intention. Their selflessness in pursuing their work, their spirit, and their unwavering perseverance are worthy of admiration and serve as eternal role models, giving a lesson to those who fail. Who can say this is not true? Therefore, social progress and construction not only require "talent" but also "perseverance."</p>
<p>However, in reality, the current society sees the rise of a large number of enterprises (including banks, companies, insurance organizations, etc.). When they hire a large number of employees, how many are truly "using talents according to their abilities"? Although there is no shortage of "emerging talents" among them, those with "mediocre talents" probably account for a considerable number. We see advertisements for the "opening" and "establishment" of various enterprises lining the front pages of newspapers every day, but we do not see news of "recruitment" and "selection" of employees. This cannot help but make people wonder where the large number of employees come from? Isn't it that "personal connections" paved the way for their advancement?</p>
<p>Using "personal connections" to place private individuals is a traditional concept in Chinese social history. However, upon closer inspection in the past, it seemed that there was some attempt to cover things up. Looking at the current situation, there are even those who regard the number of people to be hired as a condition for exchange, and various strange phenomena are arising in the real society, such as hiring those with strong connections today and dismissing them when the connections fade tomorrow. Therefore, in practice, apart from having to select a few "insiders" or people who "can make things work" to decorate the organization, it can be said that "brothers and sisters all hold official positions." "Talent" can be disregarded, but "personal connections" cannot be rejected. Therefore, the business scope of various organizations is also limited to "personal connections" to demonstrate their skills, not thinking about relying on reasonable skills.</p>
<p>Although "personal connections" are the elegance of virtuous people with many feelings, and even the strict laws established by the state are said to be inseparable from "personal connections," it seems that it is not too harsh to say so. However, abusing "personal connections" not only affects the enterprise itself but also betrays the original intention of the state's painstaking efforts to cultivate "talent." At the same time, it inevitably makes "talents" with "five carts of books" and perseverance feel "unappreciated," even hindering the budding thoughts of ambitious scholars seeking advancement. Moreover, "personal connections" have a day of loss. Who can guarantee that the foundation of various organizations and the positions of a large number of employees will be "as solid as a rock"?</p>

At the same time, it is learned that the licensing method has been reformed this time, with several points differing from the past: (1) Each person is only allowed to obtain one license; (2) They must bring their own vehicle for processing, and the vehicle must be stamped with a bell mark; (3) They must fill out the application form in detail, stating their name, address, citizen's certificate number, and vehicle style; (4) Taxis are painted in special prescribed colors.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Supply Imminent, Internally Set at Four Ounces Per Person, Price Set at Ten Yuan and Two Jiao Per Jin</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The threat to the city's edible oil supply is still extremely serious. After repeated active adjustments by the edible oil industry wholesale offices, the initial edible oil supply after the beginning of spring is expected to be implemented within this week. The purchase method this time is that the two concessions will rely on housing tax tickets, while the urban area will rely on household registration certificates and residence permits for distribution. The purchase quantity is said to have been internally set to a limit of four ounces per person, and the price will be slightly increased, calculated at ten yuan and two jiao per jin of Central Reserve Bank notes. The distribution type is only soybean oil. The implementation of oil allocation based on population is being reviewed and approved by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Inspectors of the Public Works Department All Carry Identification Cards</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that inspectors sent by the bureau all carry official identification cards with them when conducting investigations. If citizens encounter inspectors from the Bureau of Goods Control or other departments coming to investigate, they should check their identification cards in advance to be cautious. This matter was announced in Bulletin No. 6075 on September 5th of last year. The bulletin also warned citizens that if they encounter someone who cannot produce an identification card, they should not contact them about any matter, and should detain them and report them to the nearest police station. The bulletin also stated that the bureau's inspectors hope that citizens will provide various conveniences and assistance when they are performing their duties, and that the inspectors are not allowed to receive fines or money. However, it has been reported recently that some unscrupulous people have impersonated bureau inspectors and defrauded shops or residents of money, which is not the case. Therefore, it is announced again that if citizens encounter someone who cannot be identified as a person sent by the bureau, they should not contact them, and should report them to the nearest police station or report them to the bureau in writing so that they can be investigated and dealt with. This is very important.</p>

<h3>Economic News</h3>

<h3>Essay: Future Issues of Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>On March 24th, the Japanese authorities announced that they would stop issuing military scrip from April 1st. All military scrip in Central and Southern China, except for Hong Kong and Hainan Island, will be gradually withdrawn. The special yen exchange rate will be abolished. However, this new policy will not immediately eliminate the circulation of military scrip. It will continue to allow the continued circulation of military scrip and military scrip claims and debts, in order to smoothly promote the use of Central Reserve Bank notes. After this measure is implemented, it is expected that after a certain period, Central Reserve Bank notes will be able to replace military scrip and become the only legal currency in Central and Southern China, circulating in the general market. Given this relationship, the era of joint use of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank notes will lead to a future era of Central Reserve Bank notes only. Therefore, the mission of Central Reserve Bank notes is indeed significant.</p>
<p>After the China Incident occurred, the military scrip, from November of the 12th year of the Showa era (1937), made great contributions. The most significant contributions of the military scrip were the following three points: as currency for the military's expenditures to promote the war, as the only circulating currency in the era of currency chaos after the war, and as a means of fighting against the anti-Yuzhou currency offensive. Promoting the collapse of the enemy currency, the old legal tender, and assisting the development of Central Reserve Bank notes are all contributions made by military scrip. To make Central Reserve Bank notes develop to the stage of replacing military scrip in the future, it is still only possible with the support of military scrip.</p>
<p>Once the unification of Central Reserve Bank notes is realized, Central Reserve Bank notes will still have to rely on China's own economic and political strength to strengthen itself. Strengthening Central Reserve Bank notes is impossible relying solely on currency and financial work. It is necessary to consolidate China's overall political and economic strength. At present, the Yuzhou side is actively destroying Central Reserve Bank notes, and the New Fourth Army is issuing new notes to encroach on Central Reserve Bank notes. Therefore, in order to strengthen Central Reserve Bank notes, it is necessary to eliminate this economic counter-offensive and actively create a force to attack enemy currency. Strengthening itself with its own efforts is one of the important tasks for Central Reserve Bank notes in the future.</p>
<p>Second, after the abolition of the special yen system, Sino-Japanese trade can be conducted directly with Central Reserve Bank notes and yen. The method of using yen as a medium for transactions between North China and Central China has also been abolished, and Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes are directly settled. Since there is no military scrip representing yen, currencies with different currency values should naturally use direct settlement methods. In certain places or at certain times, there may be some difficulties in settlement. How should this be handled? This external issue is the second important task for Central Reserve Bank notes in the future.</p>
<p>If these two internal and external tasks cannot be properly resolved, then there is no point in talking about the actual strengthening of Central Reserve Bank notes. What measures should be taken and how should one start? It is hoped that the Chinese economic authorities will carefully consider and resolutely promote it.

<h3>National Commercial Control Association Handles Registration of Yarn and Cloth Inventory Loans, Must Be Completed Before the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has actively handled the registration of various inventories to bring commerce into order. Recently, the association handled the</p>
<p>Registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory in the city.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants are designated to be handled jointly by the Yarn Factory Federation, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cloth Industry Association, and the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and must be registered by the 31st of this month. The closing price of the inventory will be based on the closing figures of the 20th. Those who hold inventory, both inside and outside the industry, should quickly go through the procedures. As for Japanese merchants, the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry is entrusted to handle it on their behalf.</p>
<p>Moved to new location for office work yesterday</p>
<p>The General Assembly moved to the new address at 984 Avenue Edward VII yesterday (29th) for office work. The internal organizational system is divided into the Board of Directors, with a secretary's office, a review office, a counselor's office, a general affairs office, an audit office, a materials office, a finance office, and other professional committees for each industry under the chairman of the board. Once the trade associations or federations and group organizations are organized and completed, the professional committees will be generated by the various industry groups. The above organizational structure is awaiting the decision and announcement of the first meeting of the Control Materials Review Committee.</p>
<p>Hankou Branch to be established soon</p>
<p>The Hankou branch of the National Commercial Control Association is currently actively preparing for its establishment. It is expected that the date of formal establishment is not far away. It is said that the city chamber of commerce is at the center of this preparatory work.</p>
<p>Commemoration of the return to the capital, General Assembly on holiday</p>
<p>Today (30th) is the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. All sectors of the city are holding celebration ceremonies, and the customs and post office are closed for one day. Therefore, the association's office will also be closed for one day today (30th) and will stop receiving and issuing application permits.</p>
<h3>Insurance Supervisory Bureau Plans to Rectify the Inland Insurance Industry</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency: Since its establishment, the Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has spared no effort in rectifying the insurance industry in Shanghai. A total of 97 insurance companies in the city have applied to the bureau for registration and have been approved to operate. Insurance companies that have not been approved for registration are not allowed to open for business. It is learned that the bureau will end the registration matters at the end of this month. In the future, newly established insurance companies will not be allowed to register and open. It is also heard that the bureau believes that the insurance business in Shanghai has been rectified and brought into order. It plans to further rectify the inland insurance industry and will send personnel to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places to supervise the rectification of insurance industry associations. All insurance companies, branches, and agencies in various places must register in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>China Tobacco Association Implements Price-Limited Sales</h3>
<p>The China Tobacco Rationing Association is implementing cigarette rationing in the local area. The first batch of goods was distributed to various wholesalers (ie, Datonghang) on the 25th of this month, and they were required to pick up the goods before April 2nd. Retailers (Xiaotonghang) can present their cards to the designated Datonghang for delivery and pay the Public Works Department's Article Donation. It is said that the first batch of goods are all products of the military-managed Yuanzhong Tobacco Factory and the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company. The next batch of goods will be mostly national cigarettes, and the method is still in question. It is learned that the association stipulates that each cigarette store must not sell out the rationed goods within a short period of time, but must connect to the next batch of goods to prevent stores from cheating. Therefore, in the future, the quantity of cigarettes that citizens purchase from large and small cigarette stores will be limited. However, some cigarette merchants who have already received the distribution of goods have attempted to hoard them. Some stores only sell them at a limited price for a few hours in the store, and no one is allowed to buy more than one or two small packs, and they are forced to buy other miscellaneous brand cigarettes together. There are even situations where they refuse to sell at the door all day long. It is heard that the association, after receiving the report, in addition to sending personnel to investigate, has also negotiated with the authorities to work out a method of sanction to maintain the official price of cigarettes and prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating.</p>
<p>It is also learned that since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and cigarettes are not included in the controlled items, there are no restrictions on transportation. Local cigarette merchants can also transport cigarettes to other places as long as they declare them to customs and do not need to go through other procedures. Therefore, the sales to other places have been unusually loose recently. However, because wholesale in various stores has mostly stopped, and the Ningbo Road Cigarette Exchange Market has also closed down, it is quite difficult for those who want to purchase goods. Even among the same industry, there are many instances of bartering.</p>

<h3>A Look at the Past and Present of the Bank of China (4):</h3>
<p>— Jian Zhi</p>
<p>If we consider the position of bank deposits in currency, then China is different from Europe and the United States. In Europe and the United States, the value of checks is three or four times greater than the payment of physical currency. Therefore, the position of bank deposits in currency is very important. In China, except for the major trading ports, physical currency is still the most important payment tool, and the checks generated by bank deposits are only secondary. After the Incident, the position of bank deposits in currency has further declined. The deposits of the eleven banks in China only doubled from the 25th to the 31st year (1936-1942), while the increase in the amount of old legal tender issued during the same period, although no accurate figures have been announced, is at least several times greater than before. Moreover, in the Japanese-occupied areas, there is the circulation of various new currencies, so the actual increase in physical currency is quite astonishing. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of currency in China is different from Europe and the United States. Physical currency is the main driving force, especially after the Incident.</p>
<p>However, this implementation has been generally overlooked so far. People still follow the traditional concept and believe that the current economic instability is due to financial instability, and financial instability is due to the lack of self-respect of commercial banks. Since the authorities stipulated that bank deposits must be handed over to the reserve fund, limited to Xianyi, they believe that everything can be stabilized. They do not know that the nature of the current economic panic has undergone a fundamental change. At the beginning of the Incident, financial stability was more important than everything. When foreign exchange shrank sharply, economic stability still depended on finance as the hub. However, since the full implementation of reserve certificates, the economic center of gravity is no longer finance, but the production and distribution of materials. If there is no practical way to produce and distribute materials, then no matter how financial measures are taken, their effects are very limited. If they are handled improperly and cause social panic, then even if finance is very stable, it will cause disturbances and affect the overall situation. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, paper currency is now more widely circulated than checks in China, so it can be said that the power of finance is now entirely in the hands of the Central Reserve Bank. As an important town for stabilizing finance, the remaining strength of commercial banks is almost insignificant, and there is no need to over-control them. The authorities should start from increasing production and smoothing the distribution of materials, so that they can bring the economy back on track and create benefits for society.</p>
<p>Although the above discussion is a pessimistic analysis of the current commercial banks in China, this abnormal economic trend must be a temporary phenomenon during the war. When the economy stabilizes, most of the floating capital will still be concentrated in banks again, allowing banks to gradually restore their capital and their position to become important again. Although the functions of banks are inevitably subject to temporary changes, the stability of their nature cannot be shaken. (The End)</p>
