<h3 id="c1">歐洲戰局檢討 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>美蘇英三國德黑蘭會議以來，一般對於國際戰局頗多猜測，對於「第二戰綫」之說，尤為各方所注意意。但就全部戰局加以檢討，我們仍當承認，歐戰之重心，迄在東綫，不問所謂「第二戰綫」究將有何表現，今後歐局之動向，終將惟東綫之趨勢是視。因為東綫迄今吸納着雙方最龐大的兵員與戰力，絕非地中海或西北歐海上之兵力所可比擬，而實際上英美非俟德蘇在東綫演出主力之決戰，雙方蒙受絕大損害後，似乎還抱着決不孤注一擲的原則的。</p>
<p>然則東部戰綫在今日究竟有何特別可注目的現象？從季候言，東部戰綫廣大戰域，已進入第三次冬季作戰。依據德蘇戰爭的經騐，「冬將軍」原是蘇聯最大的友軍，蘇方曾一再利用嚴冬發動大攻勢。在這裏，人們不能不記起去年此時的「史太林格勒之悲劇」。然而，向為蘇軍之友的冬將軍」業巳蒞臨的東綫，却巳發生與去年大不相同的現象。</p>
<p>蘇軍自今年七月間發動不斷的猛攻，企圖乘秋冬之交，藉季候之變化，壓迫德軍退出。然而出於國際觀察家之意外，德軍在不斷地進行其防禦戰及退却戰之後，在一般人所謂將於德軍不利的秋冬之交，竟巳展開猛烈的攻勢，一舉而奪回中路戰略要點之齊托米爾城，使基輔的蘇軍主力感受極大的威脅。從戰略言，蘇軍本擬由中路作楔形推進，在德尼泊爾河西部截德國大軍為兩段，南部包圍德軍於克里米亞，北部壓迫德軍退出烏克蘭乃至白俄羅期國境。然德軍終於極度隱忍之後發動反攻，初步擊破蘇軍的計劃。可見今年冬季戰之序幕，巳與去年情勢大不相同。</p>
<p>夏秋以來，蘇軍在地域方面所佔之某種程度的優勢，當為事實。但另一方面，當知德軍在放棄其某一佔領地域之時，所進行之破壞工作，實為蘇方軍事上乃至政治上最沉重之負担。蘇聯不僅必須在此廣大的廢墟上消耗極大的人力與物資，交通設備與共他支出，還要消耗大量的防術用的兵力，要在今冬進行猛烈的反攻，事實上是不可能的。反之，德軍的戰力則　集中與强化，齊托米爾之反攻，不過小試其端而巳。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯仍舊承認德軍戰力之强大，不能不加倍集中其戰力，而東綫各區的戰事之激烈程度，亦因蘇軍之小敢暫時鬆弛其繼續攻勢，而仍有愈演愈列之勢，今年冬季的東綫，勢將繼續驚人的大消耗戰，現在我們所應注意的，是一向抱着使德蘇二强　斃之陰謀的英美，在德黑蘭會議中允應蘇聯的要求以後，在這東綫戰局轉變之際，是否還能隔岸觀火？無怪邱吉爾要患病而羅斯福要忙於國內工潮及經濟危局之處理了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">轟炸馬加斯附近日海軍機隊戰果　兩次沉毀艦艇四十餘艘 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日大本營二十二日下午四時五分發表：日深入細致　軍航空部隊，二十一日上午隔度空襲馬加斯鄕附近敵運輸船團，獲舉戰果如次：第一次擊沉敵大型運輪船二艘，特型運輸船（或為中型運輸船）四艘或五艘，巡洋艦（或為大型驅逐艦）二艘，登陸船一艘，擊毀敵驅逐艦一艘（重創起火），小型舟艇多艘。是役日機自炸或未歸還者共五架。二次擊沉敵特殊運輸船二艘、魚雷艇二艘，登陸艇約三十艘，擊毀廠驅逐艦一艘（重創起火），驅潛艇一艘（重創）運輸船一艘（重創），登陸艇多艘（重創），擊落敵機四架以上，是役日機自炸或未歸還者共五架。又敵運輸船及登陸艇均滿載水兵員及軍需品。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　新不列顚島馬加斯角及比萊羅，阿羅埃兩島之敵軍登陸部隊，因迭遭日陸海軍機及地上部隊之猛擊，受創極重。但二十一日晨敵復艦艇　衛運輸船進航於馬加斯岬，得報後，即奮然出擊，追踪滿載兵員軍需之敵船團，施以痛擊，獲舉戰果，巳如日大本營所發表。但敵仍不顧犧牲，復於是日下午再以大船國由飛機掩護下迭連登陸作戰、日海軍機即時出動，再於敵未登陸前予以猛擊，綜合此前後兩次戰果，計共擊沉敵艦艇四十三艘乃至四十四艘，擊毀其四艘以上。按敵出擊之艦艇共為六十艘以上，故其損失數目已逹全數七分之五矣</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據新金山來電四南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十二日發表：日軍機隊二十日曾來襲格德納夫島，損害死傷頗重。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據新金山電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十一日發表：日機言曾大舉襲擊弗恩半島　面之反軸心議送船團，擊沉商船一艘。</p>
<h3 id="c3">新不列顚島戰况益激烈　日軍强襲粉碎敵企圖 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　敵軍一部自十五日在新布列顚島馬加斯角一部及比萊羅與阿羅埃兩島登陸以後，戰况日形激烈，謀於登陸地設置橋頭堡之敵軍，利用飛機及舟蜓，日日軍猛烈之砲擊，企圖對共登陸部隊作補給增援。日海軍機隊與陸地部隊及陸軍機緊密協力，反覆强襲敵軍及其舟艇，粉碎其企圖，故敵登陸部隊巳遭遇危機。但敵軍仍在日軍制空權下之海域反覆以運輸船團增援，故敵損失亦日形增大，其情形巳如日大本營於二十二日所發表。按該海域從地理上觀，與中部太平洋海域或波根維　島附近海域不同，該　係處於日軍强力之制空灌下也，敵軍雖在特羅布里安島·格德納夫島·烏德拉克島以及新幾內亞島等地擁有多數之基地，但不能與日軍由於巴爾至馬加斯之距離相比較。敵雖巳在馬加斯角，比萊羅島，阿羅埃島登陸、但若不能在各該地設置空軍根據地時，則敵占領新布列顚島之野心，決難得逞也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日機晝夜出動襲達瑪兩島　予敵猛烈打擊 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電、日海軍機隊為復仇，近曾日夜擊襲吉爾貝特羣島之達拉瓦，瑪金兩島敵機塲與軍事設施，予敵以痛烈打擊。歷日戰况如次：　達拉瓦島方面，十一月二十五日夜，重創敵軍登陸部隊及機場軍事設施。二十六日黎明，重創敵登陸部隊及機塲軍事設施等。十二月四日薄暮，痛炸其飛機塲，使敵各地軍事設施發生大火。六日夜間，重創敵飛機塲。十一日午夜，痛炸敵軍事設施。十三日夜間，重創敵軍事設施，使其一處起火。卞八日夜，轟炸敵機塲滑行路。　瑪金島方面，十二月八日夜，轟炸敵軍事設施及軍需堆積地。十三日夜，轟炸敵軍事設施，有一處起火。十五日黎明，粉碎敵軍事設施，並有二處起火。十九日黎明、攻擊敵機塲及軍事設施，排除敵軍砲火與戰鬥機之抵抗，使全彈擊中目據後，各次轟炸日機均全部歸還。</p>

<p>訓詞內容</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日東條首相兼軍需相，二十二日於日本臨時方長官會議致訓詞，要目如次：今大東亞諸國家諸民族與日本同心協力，相互團結，使大東亞豐富之資源逐日戰力化，於是日本之戰力能飛躍增强，而敵人英美於物心兩方面之苦惱則漸次加深。故彼當政者　　於身逢絕處之先，若不打倒日本，則此次戰爭之結果絕不能如彼等所希望者。預期今後之戰門將愈益熾烈，蓋今恰為攻擊敵人之良機，如於此際，粉碎敵人之反攻，則敵人之戰意必將喪失，吾等為對處以上情勢當前急務，即為增强航空戰力。關於此方面之指導，希各位更進一步積極努力，此次地方長官會議之召開，以增强航空戰力問題為中心。余茲略述現下增加生產之主要者於次：蓋關於軍需生產尤以飛機之增產，如綜合各關聯部門視之，固當保持均衡為基本條件，惟需更深刻認識者，即運輸與勞力兩點乃生產之最重要條件。今者運輸巳成為完遂戰爭之大動脈，茲為確保運輸力並使其加强起見，自須舉國一心，共謀對策，政府方面迄今巳對此盡莫大之努力，同時更與大本營方面緊密聯絡，積極進行方策，至於勞務問題，並非僅指增人一點而言，乃係以提高勞工之生產能率為第一要項，因是當前要務，在使勞務配置正當化，徹底適材適所主義化，以及刷新勞務管理等。又近來國內工廠與事業廠等己激增，新設或擴充者甚夥，政府方面對此將充分使其活用，竭力監督其增產飛機大砲艦船等、以供前找之用。對此深望各位關心及協力。最後　致一言，關於昻揚國民戰意一點，總之今日之戰爭即人與人之戰，意志與意志之戰，蓋日本絕無戰敗之可能，以三年來完整無缺之團體，與夫一億國民盡忠報國之精神，必能保守我傳統之光榮。况大東亞之戰爭乃道義之戰爭，一時之戰局或不免有一進一退之現象、但最後之勝利必屬於其我。是以大東亞各國家各民族，均巳在大束亞共同宣言中所表示之堅固決意下互相緊密協力，向共同目標邁進，以此十億民衆心體合一之力，當可制服英美，故余　信署人必可獲得最後勝利。</p>

<p>謹按主席被剌受傷，係在民國二十四年十一月一日，中國國民黨六中全會開幕式後攝影時。是年正當國際局勢醖釀劇變之際，中日關係雖可有好轉之機，而英美則利於中日構暨，遂有所謂李滋羅斯貨幣計劃。一方面助長抗戰派之氣燄，一方面即藉以搜括我現金，操縱我財政金融，及對外買島之命脈。蘇俄則一面以外交上的妥協，向歐陸進出，一面以共產黨覆面的活動，向東亞爆亂。兩者陰謀，無非欲先在東亞大陸燃起戰火，以延緩歐洲大陸之戰機，以遂其把持操縱之欲。在此危撼動盪之情勢中，東亞大局能否維持安定，以應世變，抑將首當其衝，終且供人犧牲、斯實中國前途及東亞前途禍福安危之界。其時主席任行政院長兼外交部長，內審國情，外察大勢，操心危而慮患深，所定方針，在使中日關係能得好轉，即使不能，亦必不使之運轉。對共產黨覆面的活動，摧破之不遺餘力。對於英美內包毒藥之甘　，尤堅閉固拒。當時主席以行政院長兼外交部長，李　羅斯貨幣協定，主席不簽字不能成立。無如當時除少數人投身英美懷抱，供其利用外，其　唱抗戰高調者，則以為協定一成，財政無憂。對全席此種苦心遠慮，完全忽視，甚且仇視、險者乘之，陰謀百出，主席遂遭毒手。負傷太重，不能不辭職以去，於是危撼動盪之局，終於無可找同。越一年而有西安之變，又七月而蘆溝橋戰火遂起。</p>
<p>主席受傷，身被三槍，一由左臂穿過，一在左　部，碎片碎骨巳於受傷後七日取出。一由背後射入至脊骨第五公節旁，即巳夾住。八年以來，背部不時感覺痺痛。主席奔走國事，未遠顧及。迨本年八月間，背部胸部及兩脇同時發痛，連月以來，往返京滬，東渡日本會議講演，視察淸鄕，治軍勤政，宵衣旰食，辛勞尤甚於平日，而痺痛亦隨而加劇。幹部同志，盟邦當局、咸深以為念、推　專門醫師疹視、認為與背彈關有。旋復商諸盟邦軍醫，於　邦陸軍醫院縝密部查，斷定為背彈影響所致，遂決定施行手術。由後藤部隊長擔任手術，檢騐細密，診斷明確，準備週到，手術敏捷、僅二十分鐘即巳拔出，經過極為良好。盟邦醫術之精進，至堪敬佩。又主席此次在陸軍醫院施行手術，不惟手術高明，且款待週到而懇切，主席深為感佩。幹部同志亦同深感佩，外交部禇部長，當即代表我政府向盟邦致謝。</p>
<p>堀井部隊長之談話</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　汪主席於十十九日晨施行手術，割取八年前受傷時夾留背部之子彈，當即全部拔出，經過極為良好。盟邦堀井部隊長，特就此發有談話如次：汪主席閣下，在陸軍醫院經X光鏡及其他週到準備之後，於十九日上午十時四十分，收後藤部隊長擔任手術，拔取背部留彈，約二十分鐘後，即將留彈完全拔出。手術時，主席閣下並不感任何痛苦，手術之後，經過亦極為順適。手術部分幾無疼痛，睡眠安穩，飲食如常，體溫脈搏均屬正常。此後約一星期間，即可完全復原。經此次手術之後，深信以前身體健康之各種障礙，當可完全除去。今後主席閣下身體健康，當比前更為增過，誠不勝同慶者也</p>
<p>舉國民衆咸感同慶</p>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　自主席施行手術，割取背部留彈，經過良好消息發表後。政府官員、舉國民衆，及友邦人士，成深同慶，歡慰之情莫可言狀？主席此次在陸軍醫院施行手術，不惟軍醫手術高明、背　迅速拔出，且欵待尤為遲到而懇切，舉國上下，對盟邦眞摯之熱情，與醫術之精進、莫不同深感佩。尤以在此中日兩國同生共死，東亞民族精誠團結爭取決戰勝利之際，囘憶八年前主席，為國家，為東亞，艱難擔柱之苦心遠慮，受傷時主席遇變不驚，臨難不亂之精神，輝映於血泊之中，至今尤深印於吾人之心坎，令人萬感交併，由悲而壯，愈增其勇。更迫念八年來中日關係，東亞大局，世界情勢演變之經過，不幸之事變如何發生、和平運動如何披荊斬棘，得以推進，大東亞戰爭如何勝利展開，同盟條約，共同宣言，如何訂立。益使國人加深民對英美侵略前猙獰面目之敵愾，加深其對盟邦友我助我之誠意之認識。加深其對與復中華，保衛東亞之信念，　在主席領導之下，履行盟約，實踐宣言，擊滅英美，完　戰爭，以救中國而保東亞。</p>

<p>如上所述兩公司在鑄措資金方面，殆不能靠股份資本，且將來亦不能不長此收　政府的補助金。名稱雖是股份公司，實際可視為近於營團。是以由於　　情形，可知將來愈將强化營團的性格。因而也有人主張倒不如斷然改組為營團，性格旣明瞭，工作也容易。記者雖未必是應改組為營團的主張者，但如以現在的機　担任運營、則感到實有改組之必要。實質上，改換至營團化之後，始能拋棄對收益的堅持，而貫徹向國　邁進的理念。</p>
<p>華中礦業建設新設備的塲合，因華中振興的放款利率太高，故仰給於產業設備營團。這種事態的所以發生，也就因為華中振興當局堅持股份公司的觀念，不能作低利放款的緣故。隨着上述兩公司之環境和性格的變化，今後的運營，不能不相應於此。假使堅持股份公司的觀念，而不能從事國策的運　。則機構的變化似有必要吧！總而言之，在民間股份上看來，因保證了六分的紅利，故可視為確定利息證券化的東四。</p>
<p>茲報告兩公司的近况如次：</p>
<p>華北開發</p>
<p>首先為適應決戰而改革機構。將總公司從東京移至北京，使貫澈就地重心主義，把以前複雜的機　集中整理為總裁室，管理第一部（掌理交通，通信，電力）。管理第二部（掌理煤鑛，鑛山製鐵，化學工業及其他），計劃局，調查部。</p>
<p>該公司目前正在注力申的事業，有化學工業，製鐵，　　　等。去年和日本　　合辦設立華北窒素肥料（資本金四千萬圓），和日本製鐵合辦設立華北製鐵（資本金一億圓，折半出資），兩公司均巳開始工作。將近設立者有靑島製鐵及華北輕金屬。前者係與日本鋼管合作，利用金　鎭的鐵鑛石以製鐵，資本金似為五千萬圓。一部分業巳竣工，將近開始工作。華北區金屬係興輕金屬統制公司合作，擬用礬土頁岩製成鋁資本金預定三千萬圓。對此等新創事業，該公司不能不作巨額投資。</p>
<p>該公司十七年度的成績良好，雖因物價高漲而經費增加，但因投前年度增益八十一萬六千圓。又政府補助金減少七十四萬八千圓，一面償還金則增加三百十五萬七千圖，故實際成總相當向上。本年度依華北交通的初次分紅巳有八百六十八萬七千圓看來，至少可有這限度內的增益。但因物資高漲，加以投資放欵的增加，其成業究能向上至何種地步，殊難頂測。</p>
<p>華中振興</p>
<p>華中擬興所屬公司的調整，華中蠶絲和華中鹽業巳見實施華中蠶絲方面，把中國方面現物出資的三十一工廠，三倉庫，予以適當的評價而讓渡於原所有者，而暫告解散。短織維絲織，絲毛等加工部門，讓渡於今後將設立的新公司。　業方面，把海州的鹽田及日本方面所有的股份（振興會社二百萬圓，其他日本方面五十萬圓）　渡於華方，成為純粹的中國公司，設立繼承的新公司（資本金約五百萬圓），用中日合作方式，預定經營苦計原料的化學工業。因上述的驟整，該公司的收入乃告減少。靈絲的紅利八分，鹽業的紅利一成，該社的投資各二百萬閱，故雙方共減收卅六萬圓。幸該社最近成績頗佳。前年度政府補給金亦巳償還，但想到今後的物價高漲，投資增加，則上述的減收的確影響很大。不過上述的收益問題，不應當是該社所應顧到的。（完）（翔：導自東洋經濟新報第二〇九九號）</p>

<p>陸上作戰發言人首就在中國陸上對渝共之作戰情形，日軍自在華北展開肅淸蘇北共軍作戰開始以還，巳將共軍根據地澈底殲滅，於本年十一月八日告一段落，在此作戰中，擊沉敵船舶一四三艘，截獲戰利品數量龐大，至對華中渝方洞庭湖週圍發動之冬季進攻，佔領渝第六戰區常德後，渝之第二次援救軍隊第五十八軍第三軍兩軍，關從第九戰區北上援助，業經日陸軍航空部隊予以密集之襲擊，巳展開殲滅戰，此役迄至今日止，殲滅擊滅擊破之渝軍，計有第七十三軍，第一百軍，第九十九軍，第四十四軍，第十九軍，第七十四軍，第七十九軍，第六十六軍，第十八軍，以及其他部隊，綜計有二十八師之衆，陣亡師長不下十一名，是以渝方在此役所受打肇頗為重大，尤以在物質上，精神上，軍事上，經濟上，無蒙不嚴受重打擊。渝第九戰區薛岳司令曾向當地民衆發言，謂駐華日軍兵力雄厚，過去　人估計太低，切勿自揚，蓋日軍當有再度進攻之可能，於此足見渝方對日軍之恐慌，且渝軍最大之缺點，將兵力集中最前綫、而後方佈置欠强之配備，一日前綫精銳兵被日軍擊破，則混亂潰退不堪設想，由此而　，當常德被日軍佔領後，其後方情形，可想而知。</p>
<p>空戰情形</p>
<p>繼述及航空作戰情形，日駐華　　航空部隊直接協助陸上作戰隊，向渝根據地及在渝美空軍根據地不斷襲擊，且連續轟炸，終予以相當損害，本月份自四日起至十二日止，日空軍連日矗炸衡陽，零陵，梧州，韶關，以及其他渝根據地，擊落敵機四十四架，起火焚毀者計四十架，而前「二十一」日淸晨　　時，日最精銳戰門機轟炸機聯合大編隊，又空襲廣西桂林飛機塲·向渝最新設施猛烈轟炸，投彈如雨，該機場當時中彈，狼狽非常，此後獲得頗多戰果，其時適因濃露頗重，詳細戰果未得統計，而該塲受傷顯屬非輕，此外尙有戰鬥機轟炸機聯合大編隊一隊，飛向渝重要門戶長沙，襲擊衡陽機塲及各項設施，受傷頗重，且自常德經日軍佔領後，長沙地區最為惶恐，其狼狽情形，非言語所能形容。</p>
<p>緬甸戰况</p>
<p>次述緬甸戰况，自日軍將企圖　動之渝駐緬遠征軍驅逐怒江以東，並巳準備待命再開始作進攻狀態，而在印緬國境波其頓區域，最近敵方有小規模之蠢動，被日軍隨時擊破，敵空軍在日軍最前綫及後方根據地之游擊或蠢動，本月上旬前後出動計有一百四十次，出動飛機一千五百三十架，平均每日四十四次，而日空軍每次莫不給予奇襲之攻擊，故在該處當地之日空軍部隊，隨時從容邀擊，將敵擊退。且空襲紛碎渝美空軍接濟根據地之丁蘇基河，損失慘重，燬損大量飛機，是乃渝美之致命打擊，故英美進攻緬甸作戰，不能以言無積極階段，但因每次均經日軍之慘重打擊，無法施行作大規模之蠢動。同時印度方而巳有東亞民族聯合軍之出動向河薩瑪孟加拉進軍，未來之如何結果與敵之如何蠢動，是乃可預想而如者。</p>
<p>經濟界評言</p>
<h3 id="c30">撲滅物價狂漲之焰 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>近日本市物價漲風狂熾，巳成燎原之勢，而投機商人，以惑於暴利思想，更不惜火上加油，環顧全市每一角落所標物價，自商店橱窗之內，以至馬路邊階之上，幾於一日數變，每變熟高，誠為世界參戰國家實施物價統制者所絕無僅有之現象。</p>
<p>這樣一個物價狂漲之熖，徒屬人民公衆於水深火熱之中，終於使當局感覺不容坐視不救了。因此，本市物價評議委員會定於今日召集臨時緊急會議，討論緊急有效措置，而出席會議者，則有本市經濟，糧食，警察各局，及商統會，米統會，棉統會，一八兩區經濟處等各機關長官，其形勢殊類大火災中各方面救火車的集中救火一般，足徵本市物價形勢之嚴重了。</p>
<p>前此所謂如何增進物資之來源？如何疏通物資之輸運？如何使商業組合與消費者團體共同協助政府調整消費？雖在抑平物價方面，均為治本之道，可是，以眼前形勢而論，巳覺緩不濟急，則惟有先謀治標，猶如一個病人在熱度癲狂之中，首須壓制其熱，然後徐圖調理。盟邦日本在昭和十四年（民國二十八年）九月十八日有所謂「九一八」價格停止令，四年以來，所有各種物品，必須標明公定價格及品質標準，絲亳不得故違，這便是我們物價評議會今日所當取法的。</p>

<p>醫務部包括內科，肺科，兒科、外科，骨科，泌尿科，胸腔外科，產科、婦科，眼科，耳鼻咽喉以及光綫等科，都由專家負責。醫師方面，除原有內科鄭應時，婦產科鄭錫恩，兒科唐恩民，肺科擲偉如，眼科錢紹基等外，今年夏季又聘內科醫學博士吳朝仁醫師為內科系主任，吳氏為前北平協和醫學院內科敎授兼內科傳染病科主任，並曾為美國哈佛大學內科醫師；又聘顧愷時醫師為外科主任醫師，他是南開大學的理學士，國立上海醫學院醫學博士，曾任中國紅十字會總醫院外科駐院醫師主任及主治醫師等職，此外尙有肺科主任醫師丁鐘秀醫師，他也是國立上海醫學院醫學博士。歷任中國紅十字會總醫院肺科主治醫師，耳鼻咽喉科主任醫師甘智琳醫師。他是耳鼻咽喉科專家，曾任中國紅十字會總醫院耳鼻喉科主任醫師。據說，南洋醫院所有主任及全治醫師，都是專任，這是該院的中心政策，也是賅院一大特點，因此各醫師除了臨床治病以外，就不必碌碌於其他工作，而有充裕的時間來硏究和循循指導實習醫師了。</p>
<p>護士部分兩系，一系是醫院學業牋士，現在共有二十五位，她們都是中華護士學會會員，她們的工作，除為院中病人服務外，還須負責敎導看護生。另一系是護士學校，即是民國二十三年秋季創辦的上海南洋醫院高級護士戰業學校，一向以灌輸醫學常識及護病原理與技術，造就護士人才服務社會為宗旨。從去年開始，由我國護士事業的元動美國　布金醫院護士學校畢樂的伍哲英女士為校長，進一步改善該校行政上一切重要事務、並向中華護士學會立案，使本屆舉業生參加中華護士學會會考，奠定了優越的地位。因此，南洋醫院的護士部，就擔負着服務病人及部養護士人才兩大任務，向燦爛的前途邁進。</p>
<p>除了醫務護士兩部之外，其餘一切事業，就由總務部擔任。這部設有主任一人，以下分會計，人事，社會，事務等科，掌理醫院對內對外一切重要事項。大致和普通大醫院相同，也不去多訪問了。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>靑春（三）</p>
<p>上海町的第二中學校舍，是新建築的，近代式巍曦的三層大樓。鹿兒鳥這個地方，對學較和官廳的建造，特別喜歡耗資鉅景的金錢。眞人和隆夫·都被編入了一年級第二組，同一的敎當。從窗裏可以看到被　樹圍着的廣大的操塲。同級的朋友，和小學不同，有很多是「　　」—就是鄉下來的學生。</p>
<p>他們也同東京的中學生一樣，好喧嘩，好游戲。不過，對教師和上級學生的態度就不然。因為鹿兒島是重視長幼次序的地方，所以對於長上、自然很表示尊敬。同時對於時局間題，感覺也特別靈敏。不像東京的中學生，因為時局的剌激太强了，反變成漢不關心似的。</p>
<p>「上海事變、為什麽緣故而起的呢？」在下課的時間，很有談着那種間　的學生們。</p>
<p>在前年九月，滿洲事變爆發，奉天北大營的槍聲，剌激了靑年們的情感，比大人們還厲害。後來到今年一月，戰火移到上海了。林聯隊長的戰外，和空閑中佐的自殺、深刻地印入了他們的腦海中。並且更使他們興奮的，就是那肉彈三勇士的事嘳。他們巳經把那作江，北川，江下—三個人名時常唸着。三人抱着裝滿了炸藥筒的靑竹而往前的影像，時常映到他們的眼　。</p>
<p>那上海事變，在上月三日雖然一時停止戰鬥了。但是，仍然沒有結束。少年們在報紙上知道英美兩國正在背後　使着。</p>
<p>「像那麽傲慢的家伙、用軍艦和大砲，完全打盡好了。」隆夫好像巳經作了海軍軍官似的說着。眞人只是嬉嬉地笑着，什麽也不說。</p>
<p>不久上課鈴響了。是最初的英語課，圖騐，微胖，　　的緒方先生，逸敎會來了。因為是小地方，學生們在未見面以前，巳經知道緒方先生的一切了。緒方家是很有歷史的城下士族。所以都以為是很嚴厲的先生，但是一見面，好像是受了當時流行的美國漫畫的影響，似「樂　的爸爸」的靑年時代般，明朋的面悠然的臉色和聲音。</p>
<p>「我是英語的級任緒方—」站在講台上的時候，無論那一方敎師都用標準語講話，但緒方先生的聲調却是純粹的　　方言的聲調。「　今天，是頭一次的上課、所以不講書吧！我想講肉彈三勇士的故事給你們聽…」</p>
<p>學生們都嘩然喊叫起來了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">European War Situation Review <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Tehran Conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain, there has been much speculation about the international war situation, especially regarding the so-called "Second Front," which has attracted much attention. However, after reviewing the entire war situation, we must still recognize that the focus of the European war is still on the Eastern Front. Regardless of how the so-called "Second Front" will perform, the future direction of the European situation will ultimately depend on the trend of the Eastern Front. This is because the Eastern Front still absorbs the largest number of troops and combat power from both sides, which cannot be compared with the forces in the Mediterranean or the Northwest European seas. In reality, it seems that Britain and the United States are still adhering to the principle of not making a reckless gamble until Germany and the Soviet Union have staged a decisive battle on the Eastern Front and suffered huge losses on both sides.</p>
<p>So, what particularly noteworthy phenomena are there on the Eastern Front today? From a seasonal perspective, the vast war zone on the Eastern Front has entered its third winter of combat. Based on the experience of the German-Soviet war, "General Winter" was originally the Soviet Union's greatest ally, and the Soviet side repeatedly used the harsh winter to launch major offensives. Here, people cannot help but recall the "Tragedy of Stalingrad" at this time last year. However, "General Winter," who was once a friend of the Soviet army, has now arrived on the Eastern Front, but a phenomenon very different from last year has occurred.</p>
<p>Since launching continuous fierce attacks in July of this year, the Soviet army has attempted to take advantage of the autumn-winter transition and seasonal changes to force the German army to withdraw. However, to the surprise of international observers, after continuously conducting its defensive and retreating battles, the German army, at the time of the autumn-winter transition, which was generally considered unfavorable to them, actually launched a fierce offensive, taking back the strategic key point of Zhytomyr in the central sector in one fell swoop, causing the main Soviet force in Kyiv to feel a great threat. Strategically speaking, the Soviet army originally planned to advance in a wedge shape from the central sector, cutting off the German army in the western part of the Dnieper River into two sections, encircling the German army in Crimea in the south, and forcing the German army to withdraw from Ukraine and even the borders of Belarus in the north. However, after extreme forbearance, the German army finally launched a counter-offensive, initially thwarting the Soviet plan. It can be seen that the prelude to this winter's battle is very different from last year's situation.</p>
<p>Since summer and autumn, the Soviet army's certain degree of advantage in terms of territory is a fact. But on the other hand, it should be noted that the destruction work carried out by the German army when abandoning a certain occupied territory is actually the most serious burden for the Soviet side, both militarily and politically. The Soviet Union must not only expend huge amounts of manpower and materials on this vast ruin, transportation equipment and other expenses, but also consume a large amount of troops for defensive purposes, making it virtually impossible to carry out a fierce counter-offensive this winter. On the contrary, the German army's combat power has been concentrated and strengthened, and the counter-offensive in Zhytomyr is just a small test of its capabilities.</p>
<p>Now, the Soviet Union still admits the strength of the German army and cannot but redouble its concentration of combat power. The intensity of the battles in various sectors of the Eastern Front is also intensifying because the Soviet army dares not temporarily relax its continued offensive. This winter on the Eastern Front is destined to continue a staggering war of attrition. What we should pay attention to now is whether Britain and the United States, which have always harbored the conspiracy of letting Germany and the Soviet Union exhaust each other, can still watch from the sidelines after granting the Soviet Union's demands at the Tehran Conference, at this turning point in the Eastern Front war? It is no wonder that Churchill is ill and Roosevelt is busy dealing with domestic labor unrest and economic crises.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Results of Bombing Japanese Naval Air Force Near Magas: Over Forty Ships Sunk or Damaged in Two Attacks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:05 PM on the 22nd: The Japanese in-depth and meticulous military air force conducted an air raid on enemy transport convoys near Magas Village on the morning of the 21st, achieving the following results: In the first attack, two enemy large transport ships, four or five special transport ships (or medium-sized transport ships), two cruisers (or large destroyers), and one landing ship were sunk; one enemy destroyer was damaged (severely damaged and on fire); and many small boats were damaged. In this operation, a total of five Japanese aircraft self-destructed or did not return. In the second attack, two enemy special transport ships, two torpedo boats, and approximately thirty landing craft were sunk; one factory destroyer was damaged (severely damaged and on fire); one submarine chaser was damaged (severely damaged); one transport ship was damaged (severely damaged); and many landing craft were damaged (severely damaged). Four or more enemy aircraft were shot down. In this operation, a total of five Japanese aircraft self-destructed or did not return. Furthermore, enemy transport ships and landing craft were all fully loaded with naval personnel and military supplies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The enemy landing forces at Cape Magas and the islands of Bileru and Aroe in New Britain suffered extremely heavy damage due to repeated fierce attacks by Japanese army and navy aircraft and ground forces. However, on the morning of the 21st, enemy ships escorted transport ships and sailed to Cape Magas. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese forces bravely launched an attack, tracking and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy convoy loaded with soldiers and military supplies. The results have already been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. However, the enemy, disregarding sacrifices, launched another series of landing operations in the afternoon, with large ships and aircraft providing cover. Japanese naval aircraft immediately dispatched and launched a fierce attack before the enemy could land. Combining the results of these two attacks, a total of 43 to 44 enemy ships were sunk, and more than four were damaged. It is reported that the enemy dispatched more than 60 ships in total, so their losses have reached five-sevenths of the total.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 22nd that Japanese aircraft attacked Goodenough Island on the 20th, causing considerable damage and casualties.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese aircraft had launched a large-scale attack on an Anti-Axis convoy off the coast of the Huon Peninsula, sinking one merchant ship.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since a part of the enemy forces landed on a part of Cape Magas on New Britain Island and the islands of Bileru and Aroe on the 15th, the battle situation has become increasingly fierce. The enemy forces, attempting to establish a beachhead at the landing site, have been using aircraft and boats to carry out fierce shelling of the landing forces daily, attempting to resupply and reinforce them. The Japanese naval air force, in close cooperation with the ground forces and army aircraft, has repeatedly launched strong attacks on the enemy forces and their boats, thwarting their attempts, and the enemy landing forces have encountered a crisis. However, the enemy forces are still repeatedly reinforcing with transport convoys in the sea area under Japanese air supremacy, so the enemy's losses are also increasing daily, as the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 22nd. Geographically speaking, this sea area is different from the central Pacific sea area or the sea area near Bougainville Island. It is under the strong air control of the Japanese forces. Although the enemy has many bases on the Trobriand Islands, Goodenough Island, Woodlark Island, and New Guinea, it cannot compare with the distance from Rabaul to Magas for the Japanese forces. Although the enemy has already landed at Cape Magas, Bileru Island, and Aroe Island, if they cannot establish air force bases in these areas, then the enemy's ambition to occupy New Britain Island will definitely be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Content of the Address</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of Munitions, delivered an address at the Japanese Provisional Local Governors' Conference on the 22nd. The main points are as follows: Today, the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia are cooperating and uniting as one with Japan, making the abundant resources of Greater East Asia into war capabilities day by day. As a result, Japan's war capabilities are increasing dramatically, while the suffering of the enemy, Britain and the United States, in both material and spiritual terms, is gradually deepening. Therefore, their politicians must defeat Japan before they find themselves in a desperate situation, otherwise the outcome of this war will definitely not be what they hope for. It is expected that the fighting in the future will become even more intense, as now is a good opportunity to attack the enemy. If we crush the enemy's counter-offensive at this time, their will to fight will definitely be lost. To deal with the above situation, our urgent task is to enhance our air war capabilities. Regarding guidance in this area, I hope that you will make even greater efforts. The convening of this local governors' conference is centered on the issue of enhancing air war capabilities. I will briefly describe the main points of increasing production at this time: Regarding munitions production, especially the increase in aircraft production, when considering all related departments, it is essential to maintain balance as a basic condition. However, what needs to be recognized more deeply is that the two most important conditions for production are transportation and labor. Today, transportation has become the lifeline for completing the war. In order to ensure and strengthen transportation capacity, the entire nation must work together to devise countermeasures. The government has made great efforts in this regard so far, and is also actively implementing policies in close coordination with the Imperial Headquarters. As for the labor issue, it does not only refer to increasing the number of people, but also to improving the productivity of workers as the top priority. Therefore, the current urgent tasks are to rationalize labor allocation, thoroughly implement the principle of placing the right person in the right job, and improve labor management. Furthermore, the number of domestic factories and establishments has increased sharply in recent years, with many new establishments or expansions. The government will fully utilize these, striving to supervise their increased production of aircraft, artillery, warships, etc., for use on the front lines. I deeply hope for your concern and cooperation in this regard. Finally, I would like to say a word about boosting national morale. In short, today's war is a war between people and people, a war between wills and wills. Japan has absolutely no possibility of defeat. With three years of complete and flawless unity, and the spirit of a hundred million people serving the country with loyalty, we will surely preserve the glory of our tradition. Moreover, the Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness. The war situation at any given time may inevitably experience advances and retreats, but the final victory will surely belong to us. Therefore, all the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia are cooperating closely with each other under the firm determination expressed in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, moving towards a common goal. With the unified strength of the minds and bodies of these one billion people, we can defeat Britain and the United States. Therefore, I firmly believe that we will surely achieve final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Chairman Wang's Removal of a Bullet Fragment from His Back; Publicity Department Announces Positive Results; Chen, Zhou, and Bao to Assume Separate Responsibilities for Political Affairs <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Publicity Department issued the following public announcement at 5:00 PM on December 22nd: "Chairman Wang underwent surgery on the morning of the 19th to remove a bullet fragment lodged in his back from an injury sustained eight years ago. The bullet was completely extracted, and the procedure went extremely well."</p>
<p>During the treatment period, the Supreme National Defense Council and the Military Affairs Commission will be handled by Committee Member Chen Bo. Administrative Yuan meetings and daily political affairs will be overseen by Deputy Director Fo Hai. Daily affairs of the Military Affairs Commission will be handled by Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue, each responsible for their respective areas. Major military, political, and diplomatic strategies will still involve summoning relevant officials for personal instructions as needed.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Chairman Wang was injured in an assassination attempt on November 1st of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), after a group photo following the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. At that time, international affairs were brewing major changes. Although Sino-Japanese relations had a chance to improve, Britain and the United States favored a Sino-Japanese conflict and promoted the so-called "Leith-Ross currency plan." This plan aimed to both fuel the flames of the resistance faction and exploit our cash reserves, control our financial institutions, and dominate our lifeline for overseas purchases. Simultaneously, Soviet Russia, while making diplomatic compromises to advance into Europe, was also stirring up unrest in East Asia through communist activities. The conspiracy of both was nothing more than to ignite the flames of war on the East Asian continent first, to delay the opportunity for war in Europe and to fulfill their desire to control and manipulate. In such a precarious and volatile situation, whether the stability of the overall situation in East Asia could be maintained to cope with global changes, or whether it would be the first to bear the brunt and ultimately be sacrificed, was truly the boundary between fortune, misfortune, safety, and danger for China's future and the future of East Asia. At that time, Chairman Wang, serving as both Premier and Foreign Minister, carefully examined the national situation and observed the broader trends, deeply concerned about the dangers and anticipating potential disasters. The policy he set was to seek an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, and even if that was not possible, to prevent them from deteriorating. He spared no effort in crushing the activities of disguised communists. He firmly rejected the sweetened poison offered by Britain and the United States. As Premier and Foreign Minister, Chairman Wang's signature was required for the Leith-Ross currency agreement to take effect. Unfortunately, apart from a few who embraced Britain and the United States and were used by them, most of those who loudly advocated resistance believed that the agreement's completion would ensure financial security. They completely ignored Chairman Wang's painstaking foresight, even viewing it with hostility. The conspirators seized the opportunity, plotting every scheme imaginable, leading to Chairman Wang being attacked. His injuries were too severe, forcing him to resign, and the precarious and volatile situation ultimately became unmanageable. A year later, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and in July of the following year, the flames of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident were ignited.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang suffered three gunshot wounds. One passed through his left arm, and another was in his left cheek, with fragments and bone splinters removed seven days after the injury. A third bullet entered from behind, lodging next to the fifth lumbar vertebra. For eight years, he periodically experienced numbness and pain in his back. Chairman Wang was preoccupied with national affairs and did not have time to address it. In August of this year, he began experiencing pain in his back, chest, and both sides, traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai for months, crossing to Japan for meetings and lectures, inspecting Qingxiang, managing the military, and diligently administering the government, working even harder than usual. The numbness and pain intensified accordingly. Cadres, comrades, and Allied authorities were deeply concerned and recommended specialized physicians for examination, who believed it was related to the bullet in his back. Subsequently, they consulted with Allied military doctors, who conducted thorough examinations at the Allied Army Hospital, concluding that it was caused by the bullet in his back, and a decision was made to perform surgery. Commander Goto led the surgical team, conducting meticulous examinations, making a clear diagnosis, and preparing thoroughly. The surgery was swift, taking only twenty minutes to extract the bullet completely, and the procedure went extremely well. The Allied medical skills were truly admirable. Moreover, Chairman Wang was not only impressed by the high level of surgical skill at the Army Hospital but also by the thoughtful and sincere treatment he received. Cadres and comrades were equally impressed, and Foreign Minister Chu immediately expressed gratitude to the Allied authorities on behalf of our government.</p>
<p>Talks by Commander Horii</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Chairman Wang underwent surgery on the morning of the 19th to remove a bullet fragment lodged in his back from an injury sustained eight years ago. The bullet was completely extracted, and the procedure went extremely well. Allied Commander Horii made the following statement regarding this: After undergoing X-ray examinations and thorough preparations at the Army Hospital, Chairman Wang was operated on by Commander Goto on the morning of the 19th at 10:40 AM to remove the bullet from his back. Approximately twenty minutes later, the bullet was completely extracted. Chairman Wang did not experience any pain during the surgery, and his recovery has been very smooth. There is minimal pain in the surgical area, his sleep is sound, his appetite is normal, and his temperature and pulse are all within normal ranges. He is expected to make a full recovery in about a week. It is believed that this surgery will completely remove all previous obstacles to his health. In the future, Chairman Wang's health will be even better than before, which is a cause for mutual celebration.</p>
<p>The Entire Nation Feels the Same Joy</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the announcement of the positive results of Chairman Wang's surgery to remove the bullet fragment from his back, government officials, the entire nation, and friends from Allied countries have expressed their deep joy and relief beyond words. During Chairman Wang's surgery at the Army Hospital, not only were the military doctors highly skilled, quickly removing the bullet, but the treatment was also particularly thoughtful and sincere. The entire nation, both high and low, is deeply impressed by the genuine enthusiasm and advanced medical skills of the Allies. Especially at this time when China and Japan are sharing life and death together, and East Asian nations are sincerely united in striving for a decisive victory, recalling Chairman Wang's painstaking foresight eight years ago, bearing the burden for the nation and for East Asia, and his spirit of remaining calm and composed in the face of danger at the time of his injury, shining through the pool of blood, is still deeply imprinted in our hearts, filling us with a mixture of emotions, turning sorrow into strength, and increasing our courage. We are further reminded of the events that have unfolded in Sino-Japanese relations, the overall situation in East Asia, and the global situation over the past eight years, how the unfortunate incidents occurred, how the peace movement overcame obstacles to advance, how the Greater East Asia War victoriously unfolded, and how the alliance treaty and joint declaration were established. This has deepened the nation's understanding of the ferocious face of Anglo-American aggression, deepened its recognition of the Allies' sincerity in befriending and assisting us, and deepened its belief in reviving China and protecting East Asia. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we will fulfill the alliance treaty, implement the declaration, defeat Anglo-America, complete the war, save China, and protect East Asia.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Raids Guilin Airfield, Shooting Down Fifteen Chongqing Planes</p>
<p>Hankou, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese army air units raided Hengyang and Changsha in Hunan Province, and Guilin in Guangxi Province, on the 21st, inflicting severe damage on Chongqing military facilities.

<p>US Air Force in Chongqing Suffers Deadly Blow</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Japanese military base report, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing took advantage of the rainy season in Burma to vigorously strengthen its forces via the air transport route between Tinsukia and Kunming. It placed its main bomber force around Kunming and used Guilin, Lingling, and Suichuan as forward bases, intending to launch a guerrilla counterattack at the opportunity. In response, the Japanese army air force frequently launched attacks on their bases, intercepting their counterattacks, repeatedly inflicting deadly blows. At the same time, they blockaded the air transport route between Tinsukia and Kunming, forcing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing into dire straits. It is reported that since the beginning of this year, the elite Japanese army air force in Burma has shot down approximately 700 enemy planes. Furthermore, since November 17th, they have repeatedly intercepted the China-India air transport route and fiercely attacked the Tinsukia airfield, continuously shooting down or destroying 69 enemy planes. On the 18th, they unexpectedly attacked the Kunming airfield, shooting down or destroying 22 enemy planes.</p>

<p>No Change in Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new Bolivian cabinet was officially formed on the afternoon of the 21st, with Easton Soruco taking office as Prime Minister. After the establishment of the new cabinet, a declaration was issued as follows: The old government squandered national funds, acted improperly, abused its power for personal gain, and failed to uphold national interests. The Bolivian people and young Bolivian soldiers have resolutely risen up and overthrown the regime. In addition, Secretary-General Pinsba Mousse announced the new government's political program as follows: Bolivia's natural resources must be developed as much as possible for the benefit of the majority of Bolivian citizens. In the past, foreign companies have not considered Bolivia's interests in the development of these natural resources. We will closely cooperate with the United States, but we must safeguard Bolivia's interests. Many Bolivian citizens are still backward in economic and educational aspects, so we will strive for the rapid development of the general public in the economic and educational fields in the future.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the German news agency: Bolivia has formally notified South American countries of the change of government.

<h3 id="e18">The Future of the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company (2) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, both companies can hardly rely on share capital for funding and will inevitably have to continue receiving government subsidies in the future. Although nominally joint-stock companies, they can actually be regarded as similar to public corporations. Therefore, based on the current situation, it can be seen that their character as public corporations will be further strengthened in the future. As a result, some people advocate that they should be decisively reorganized into public corporations. With a clearer character, their work would be easier. Although this reporter may not necessarily advocate for reorganization into public corporations, I feel that there is a real need for reorganization if the current institutions are to be responsible for operations. In essence, only after transforming into public corporations can they abandon their insistence on profits and implement the ideal of moving towards the nation.</p>
<p>In the case of new equipment construction for mining in Central China, the Central China Development Company's lending rates are too high, so they rely on the Industrial Equipment Public Corporation. This situation occurred because the Central China Development Company insisted on the concept of a joint-stock company and could not provide low-interest loans. With changes in the environment and character of the aforementioned two companies, future operations must correspond to this. If they insist on the concept of a joint-stock company and cannot engage in national policy operations, then a change in the structure seems necessary! In short, from the perspective of private shares, because a six-percent dividend is guaranteed, it can be regarded as Dongsi, which has securitized fixed interest.</p>
<p>The current situation of the two companies is reported as follows:</p>
<p>North China Development</p>
<p>First, to adapt to the decisive battle, the organization is being reformed. The head office is being moved from Tokyo to Beijing to thoroughly implement the principle of emphasizing on-site operations. The previously complex structures are being consolidated into the President's Office, the First Management Department (responsible for transportation, communication, and electricity), the Second Management Department (responsible for coal mining, mining, iron and steel manufacturing, chemical industry, and others), the Planning Bureau, and the Investigation Department.</p>
<p>The company is currently focusing on the chemical industry, iron and steel manufacturing, and so on. Last year, it jointly established the North China Nitrogen Fertilizer Company (capital of 40 million yen) with a Japanese company, and the North China Iron and Steel Company (capital of 100 million yen, with equal investment) with Nippon Steel. Both companies have already started operations. Companies that are about to be established include Qingdao Iron and Steel and North China Light Metals. The former is in cooperation with Nippon Kokan, using the iron ore in Jinchenzhen to produce iron and steel, with a capital of approximately 50 million yen. Part of the project has been completed and is about to start operations. North China Light Metals is in cooperation with the Light Metals Control Company, planning to use alumina shale to produce aluminum, with a planned capital of 30 million yen. The company must make huge investments in these new ventures.</p>
<p>The company's performance in the seventeenth fiscal year was good. Although expenses increased due to rising prices, the profit increased by 816,000 yen compared to the previous year. In addition, government subsidies decreased by 748,000 yen, while repayments increased by 3.157 million yen, so the overall performance actually improved significantly. Given that North China Transportation's first dividend is expected to be 8.687 million yen this year, it seems that there will be at least that much profit increase. However, due to rising prices and increased investment and lending, it is difficult to predict how much the performance can improve.</p>
<p>Central China Development</p>
<p>Central China plans to adjust the companies under its umbrella. The adjustments have already been implemented for Central China Silk and Central China Salt. In terms of Central China Silk, the 31 factories and 3 warehouses contributed in kind by the Chinese side will be appropriately evaluated and transferred to the original owners, and the company will be temporarily dissolved. The short-fiber silk weaving and wool processing departments will be transferred to a new company to be established in the future. In terms of the salt industry, the Haizhou salt fields and the shares held by the Japanese side (2 million yen for the Development Company and 500,000 yen for other Japanese entities) will be transferred to the Chinese side, becoming a purely Chinese company. A new company will be established to inherit the business (capital of approximately 5 million yen), and it is planned to engage in the chemical industry of salt raw materials in a Sino-Japanese cooperative manner. Due to the aforementioned adjustments, the company's income has decreased. The silk company's dividend is 8 percent, and the salt industry's dividend is 10 percent. The company's investment in each is 2 million yen, so the total reduction is 360,000 yen. Fortunately, the company's recent performance has been quite good. The government subsidy from the previous year has also been repaid, but considering the rising prices and increased investment in the future, the aforementioned reduction in income will indeed have a significant impact. However, the aforementioned income problem should not be the concern of the company. (End) (Xiang: Translated from Toyo Keizai Shinpo, No. 2099)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Regulations for Registering Specially Taxed Imported Goods Established; Tax Bureau Sets Implementation Date for January <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau believes that the Provisional Regulations for Special Temporary Taxes on Tung Oil, Tea, Bristles, and Down apply only to domestically produced goods of those categories. Since there are no tax provisions for goods imported from abroad, they are exempt from taxation. As a result, merchants often mix domestically produced goods with imported goods to evade taxes for profit, which hinders tax revenue. The bureau has established nine Provisional Measures for Registering Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down Subject to Special Temporary Taxes. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval in conjunction with the Customs Administration, instructing all merchants to comply with the measures from January 1, 1944. All those engaged in the import of Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down must register with the bureau or complete procedures for separate transport, transfer, or repackaging.</p>
<p>Measures for Registering Specially Taxed Imported Goods</p>
<p>Article 1: Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down imported from abroad shall be subject to the registration procedures according to these measures, in addition to the exemption from temporary special taxes as stipulated in the Temporary Special Tax Regulations. Article 2: When specially taxed goods arrive from abroad, the original transporting merchant shall fill out an application form, and submit it together with the customs import tax bill to the Tax Bureau for registration. The quantity and quality of the goods shall be verified, and after approval, a "Registration Certificate for Specially Taxed Imported Goods" shall be issued. In addition, a "Inspection Certificate for Specially Taxed Imported Goods" shall be affixed to each package's important sealed portions, with the official stamp and date stamp to serve as proof. Article 3: If registered specially taxed imported goods need to be transported separately, transferred, or repackaged and sold, the merchant shall fill out a separate application form and submit it along with the original certificate to the Tax Bureau for verification and issuance of a separate transport permit, transfer certificate, or repackaging transport permit. If repackaging is involved, the original inspection certificate must be removed, and a new repackaging inspection certificate must be affixed. All permits and certificates must be stamped with the words "Specially Taxed Imported Goods" to facilitate inspection and release. Article 4: If a merchant imports specially taxed goods without registering as required upon arrival and is discovered by the inspection authorities, in addition to completing the registration, a fine of up to 2,000 yuan shall be imposed. Article 5: If registered specially taxed imported goods need to be transported separately, transferred, or repackaged without applying for a separate transport permit, transfer certificate, or repackaging transport permit, and are moved without authorization, a fine of up to 1,000 yuan shall be imposed. Article 6: If a merchant uses old containers of specially taxed imported goods to package domestic specially taxed goods, hoping to fraudulently evade taxes, the goods shall be confiscated and confiscated after confirmation, and a fine of up to ten times the tax amount shall be imposed. Article 7: If a merchant forges registration certificates and inspection certificate stamps for specially taxed imported goods, hoping to simplify the process and avoid registration, they shall be transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation and prosecution once verified. Article 8: These measures may be amended at any time if there are any unaddressed matters. Article 9: These measures shall take effect from the date of approval.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Recent Battle Situation of Japanese Army in China and Burma: Remarks by Japanese Army Spokesman <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The spokesman of the reporting department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, yesterday at 3:00 PM, made a statement on the battle situation of the Japanese Army in China and Burma at the regular reporting session, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding land operations, the spokesman first discussed the situation of the Japanese Army's operations against the Chongqing Communists in China. Since the start of the Japanese Army's operation to clear the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu, the Communist base areas have been thoroughly destroyed, and the operation concluded on November 8th of this year. During this operation, 143 enemy ships were sunk, and a large amount of spoils of war were seized. As for the winter offensive launched by the Chongqing side in central China around Dongting Lake, after the capture of Changde in the sixth war zone of Chongqing, the Chongqing's second reinforcement army, the 58th Army and the 3rd Army, moved north from the ninth war zone to provide assistance. The Japanese Army Air Force launched a dense attack on them and launched an annihilation battle. As of today, the Chongqing troops annihilated, defeated, and destroyed in this battle include the 73rd Army, the 100th Army, the 99th Army, the 44th Army, the 19th Army, the 74th Army, the 79th Army, the 66th Army, the 18th Army, and other units, totaling 28 divisions. No fewer than 11 division commanders were killed in battle. Therefore, Chongqing suffered a significant blow in this battle, especially in terms of material, spiritual, military, and economic aspects. Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Zone in Chongqing, once told the local people that the Japanese troops stationed in China were strong and that past estimates had been too low. He warned them not to be complacent, as the Japanese army might launch another attack. This shows Chongqing's fear of the Japanese army. Moreover, the biggest weakness of the Chongqing army is that it concentrates its forces on the front line, while the rear is weakly deployed. If the elite troops on the front line are defeated by the Japanese army, a chaotic collapse is unimaginable. From this perspective, after Changde was captured by the Japanese army, the situation in its rear can be imagined.</p>
<p>Air War Situation</p>
<p>Continuing to describe the air operations, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China directly assisted the land operations troops, continuously attacking Chongqing's base areas and the US Air Force base areas in Chongqing, and continuously bombing them, ultimately inflicting considerable damage. This month, from the 4th to the 12th, the Japanese Air Force continuously bombed Hengyang, Lingling, Wuzhou, Shaoguan, and other Chongqing base areas, shooting down 44 enemy aircraft and setting 40 on fire. And on the morning of the "21st", a joint large formation of the most elite fighter-bombers of the Japanese army also raided the Guilin Airport in Guangxi, fiercely bombing Chongqing's latest facilities, dropping bombs like rain. The airport was hit at the time, and it was extremely chaotic. Since then, many battle results have been obtained. At that time, due to the heavy fog, detailed battle results could not be counted, but the damage to the airport was obviously not light. In addition, a joint large formation of fighter-bombers flew to Changsha, an important gateway to Chongqing, attacking Hengyang Airport and various facilities, causing considerable damage. Moreover, since Changde was occupied by the Japanese army, the Changsha area was most frightened, and its embarrassment was beyond description.</p>
<p>Burma Battle Situation</p>
<p>Next, the battle situation in Burma was described. Since the Japanese army drove the Chongqing-based expeditionary force stationed in Burma, which attempted to launch an offensive, east of the Nujiang River, and has been preparing to wait for orders to start another offensive, there have been small-scale movements by the enemy in the Pochiton area on the border between India and Burma, which have been defeated by the Japanese army at any time. The enemy air force carried out guerrilla warfare or disturbances in the front line and rear base areas of the Japanese army, totaling 140 sorties around the beginning of this month, with 1,530 aircraft dispatched, averaging 44 sorties per day. The Japanese air force gave surprise attacks every time, so the Japanese air force units stationed there calmly repelled the enemy at any time. The air raids shattered the Chongqing-US Air Force's supply base in Dinsukia, causing heavy losses and destroying a large number of aircraft, which was a fatal blow to Chongqing and the United States. Therefore, the Anglo-American offensive in Burma cannot be said to be without an active stage, but because it has been severely attacked by the Japanese army every time, it has been unable to carry out large-scale disturbances. At the same time, the East Asian National United Army in India has launched an offensive towards Hossama in Bengal. The future outcome and how the enemy will stir are foreseeable.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e30">Extinguishing the Flames of Rampant Price Increases <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price increase trend in this city has been rampant, forming a prairie fire, and speculative merchants, seduced by the idea of ​​profiteering, are not hesitating to add fuel to the fire. Looking around every corner of the city, the prices marked on goods, from inside the shop windows to on the edges of the roads, change several times a day, each change becoming higher, which is a phenomenon rarely seen in countries participating in the war that implement price controls.</p>
<p>Such a rampant flame of price increases only plunges the public into deep water and scorching fire, and finally makes the authorities feel that they cannot sit idly by. Therefore, the city's Price Review Committee is scheduled to convene an emergency meeting today to discuss emergency effective measures. The attendees of the meeting will include the heads of the city's Economic, Food, and Police Bureaus, as well as the Commercial Control Committee, the Rice Control Committee, the Cotton Control Committee, and the Economic Offices of the First and Eighth Districts. The situation is very similar to the concentration of fire trucks from all sides to put out a major fire, which fully shows the seriousness of the price situation in the city.</p>
<p>The so-called how to increase the source of materials? How to smooth the transportation of materials? How to enable commercial associations and consumer groups to jointly assist the government in adjusting consumption? Although these are all fundamental ways to suppress price increases, considering the current situation, it feels like they are slow to take effect. Therefore, we can only seek temporary solutions first, just like a patient in the throes of a fever, we must first suppress the heat before slowly conditioning. The Allied country of Japan had a so-called "September 18" price freeze order on September 18th of Showa 14 (1939), stipulating that for the past four years, all kinds of goods must be marked with officially set prices and quality standards, and no violation is allowed. This is what our Price Review Committee should learn from today.</p>

<p>Recently, the main trade associations in this city have stated that the districts of Fengxian, Nansi, Beiqiao, Chuansha, and Chongming, which they belong to, are too far away from the association's headquarters, making it inevitable that they will be unable to attend to all concerns in terms of control and guidance. Therefore, they have all requested the Commercial Control Committee to allow them to establish branch offices in each district. It is now understood that the Commercial Control Committee has added consideration, that various trade associations may establish offices in various districts when there is a need in their business.</p>

Newly established egg businesses in each district that have obtained approval documents or receipt of submissions from the food authorities of each district, but have not obtained a certificate, shall not be allowed to join the association. The food authorities mentioned in these regulations are the Ministry of Food at the central level, the Food Bureau at the provincial and municipal levels, and the county and municipal governments at the district and municipal levels.</p>

<h3 id="e34">New Products from Cotton Weaving Factories Still Need to be Registered <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: According to reporter inquiries, the amount of reserved goods requested by each cotton weaving factory has been approved by the Commercial Control Committee, and notifications are now being sent separately. If it is within the scope of the reserved amount, work can be started and used. Those who store the outer power can apply to the Cotton Industry Management Office of the association to handle the transfer procedures. However, new products still need to be registered with the association and cannot be disposed of without authorization. The association has sent a letter to the Cotton Weaving Factory Industry Association for reference and notification.</p>
<p>Summary of Market Conditions</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The market became increasingly depressed yesterday, and most issues failed to open. As the end of the year approaches, debt matters are sparse. Why are stocks any different? The news is positive, but credit is tight, making it temporarily impossible to rally. Category C bonds opened steadily, then rebounded. After that, they relapsed into their old ways and gradually declined. The price was the lowest in recent times, and at the end of the morning, it was two and a half yuan lower than the previous day. The trading of other grains was even scarcer. Category A was down one yuan, and there were no transactions at all for the rest. There were price quotations for Category E bonds, but no inquiries for Category B and D bonds.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: Yesterday's interbank lending rate quoted by the Money Industry Association was two cents, which actually rose by two points again. This is because the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the financial sector is recovering loans, causing credit to tighten.</p>
<p>Grain: The market was stable yesterday. In addition, with the announcement of the distribution of household rice, people's hearts gradually became more stable. Demand was relatively balanced. Both ordinary and thin japonica rice were around 2.6 yuan. The trend of oil and grain was first firm and then stable, and in the end, it was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Hua Stocks Inevitably Downstream; Investment Stocks Still Firm Yesterday <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The situation where Hua stocks had been fluctuating for several days has become difficult to maintain. Yesterday, a tragic decline suddenly unfolded. In the morning, amidst the tightening of credit and continuing the weakness of the previous day, they collapsed and did not return. In the afternoon, there were finally buyers who saw low prices, but in the end, they still squeezed out a small amount. However, the market turned firmer after the close of trading in the evening. Department stores, such as Wing On, fell to as low as 200 yuan. Among the textile industry, Zhenfeng was uniquely firm. Wing On, Sino, and other yarn factories were all weak. In the pharmaceutical industry, New Asia and Sino-French were both cleared. In the real estate industry, Yongxing rose to over 40 yuan, but then fell back. Among the investment stocks, New China and Lyra were firm, and Xinghua and Greater China were slightly higher. Trading was not active throughout the day. According to the notice, the stock exchange will be closed from the sixth issue of this period, waiting for the reopening after the New Year holidays.

In addition, there is Dr. Ding Zhongxiu, director of pulmonology, who is also a Doctor of Medicine from the National Shanghai Medical College. He has served as an attending physician in the Department of Pulmonology at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital. Dr. Gan Zhilin is the chief physician of otolaryngology. He is an expert in otolaryngology and has served as the chief physician of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital. It is said that all the directors and full-time physicians of Nanyang Hospital are full-time, which is the hospital's central policy and a major feature of the hospital. Therefore, in addition to clinical treatment, each physician does not have to be busy with other work, and has ample time to conduct research and patiently guide interns.</p>
<p>The nursing department is divided into two systems. One system is hospital academic nurses, and there are currently twenty-five of them. They are all members of the Chinese Nurses Association. In addition to serving the patients in the hospital, they are also responsible for teaching nurses' aides. The other system is the nursing school, namely the Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Advanced Nursing Vocational School, which was founded in the autumn of 1934. It has always been aimed at imparting medical knowledge and nursing principles and techniques, and cultivating nursing talents to serve the society. Since last year, Ms. Wu Zheying, a graduate of the nursing school of Jin Hospital in the United States, the originator of the nursing profession in China, has served as the principal, further improving all important administrative affairs of the school, and has registered with the Chinese Nurses Association, laying an excellent foundation for this year's graduates to participate in the Chinese Nurses Association's examination. Therefore, the nursing department of Nanyang Hospital shoulders the two major tasks of serving patients and nurturing nursing talents, moving towards a bright future.</p>
<p>In addition to the medical and nursing departments, all other business is handled by the general affairs department. This department has one director, and is divided into accounting, personnel, social, and affairs departments, which manage all important internal and external matters of the hospital. It is roughly the same as an ordinary large hospital, and I will not ask about it much.</p>

<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (3)</p>
<p>The Second Middle School in Shanghai-machi is a newly built, modern three-story building. Kagoshima, this place, is particularly fond of spending huge sums of money on the construction of schools and government offices. Both Makoto and Takao were assigned to Class 2 of the first grade, the same classroom. From the window, you can see the vast sports field surrounded by trees. Unlike elementary school, many of the friends in the same grade are "country bumpkins" - that is, students from the countryside.</p>
<p>They, like middle school students in Tokyo, like to make noise and play games. However, their attitude towards teachers and upperclassmen is different. Because Kagoshima values ​​the order of seniority, they naturally show great respect for their elders. At the same time, they are particularly sensitive to current affairs issues. Unlike middle school students in Tokyo, because the stimulation of current events is too strong, they have become indifferent to them.</p>
<p>"What caused the Shanghai Incident?" During recess, students were talking about such questions.</p>
<p>In September of the previous year, the Manchurian Incident broke out, and the sound of gunfire at the Beida Camp in Fengtian stimulated the emotions of young people more than adults. Later, in January of this year, the flames of war shifted to Shanghai. The battles of the Lin Regiment and the suicide of Lieutenant Colonel Kuida deeply imprinted themselves in their minds. And what excited them even more was the story of the three brave soldiers who became human bombs. They have already recited the three names of Sakue, Kitagawa, and Ezaki. The image of the three holding green bamboo filled with explosive cylinders and moving forward constantly appeared in their eyes.</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Incident temporarily ceased fighting on the 3rd of last month, it was still not over. The boys learned from the newspapers that the United Kingdom and the United States were instigating things behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"Those arrogant guys should be completely wiped out with warships and cannons," Takao said, as if he had already become a naval officer. Makoto just smiled happily and said nothing.</p>
<p>Soon the class bell rang. It was the first English class. Mr. Ogata, who was round, slightly fat, and unkempt, came to the classroom. Because it was a small place, the students already knew everything about Mr. Ogata before they met him. The Ogata family is a very historical samurai family. So everyone thought he would be a very strict teacher, but when they met him, he seemed to have been influenced by the popular American comics of the time, with a cheerful face and voice like a young man in "The Happy Hooligan."</p>
<p>"I am Ogata, your English teacher," he said. When standing on the podium, all teachers speak in standard language, but Mr. Ogata's tone was purely the local dialect. "Today is the first class, so I won't talk about the book! I want to tell you the story of the three brave soldiers who became human bombs..."</p>
<p>The students all shouted in uproar.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Wenrui wrote yesterday: "My late mother, Madam Liu, was compassionate and caring in her lifetime. She secretly sent people to help the destitute every year as her responsibility. She was self-denying and benefited others, and was truly an outstanding talent among women. I have not fulfilled my filial piety during her lifetime, nor have I done anything for her after her death. My heart is painful, and there is no time to release it. Recently, the weather is about to become severely cold, which is the time for my mother to give alms. I especially donate 5,000 yuan to purchase winter clothing on her behalf, to fulfill my mother's unfinished aspirations, and perhaps slightly atone for my previous transgressions, and pray that my mother smiles in the afterlife."</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Mingshan wrote yesterday, sending 5,000 yuan saved from banquet expenses, and an additional 2,500 yuan for distribution. According to various items</p>
<p>Gospel for the Mute</p>
<p>Li Yi, a mute overseas Chinese in Xiamen, has rented Santeli in Fuchun Alley, Nanshi, as a preparation office for establishing the Nanshi School for the Mute. He has also appointed Huang Zhenshi and Yue Zhenbao as school directors. The school is scheduled to open in the spring of next year. Celebrities from Shanghai, such as Lu Ying and Li Xiaoxian, are happy to sponsor the school.</p>
<p>Children's Welfare Association's Variety Show: The Chinese Children's Welfare Association's Children's Education Center (No. 639 Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi) said: "We have received the 2,500 yuan for supplementary winter clothing donated by Ms. Yue Lan from the Xinwen Bao, and we will distribute it on your behalf. The Shanghai Children's Education Center will also hold a variety show at 3:00 PM on the 25th of this month. Welcome to participate. Please send gifts from all sectors to the association before 5:00 PM on the 24th."</p>
<p>Establishment of the Taoist Association: The Chinese Taoist Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month at the Baiyun Guan Association Hall on Fangxie Road, Nanshi.</p>
