<h3>擴大拒毒</h3>
<p>一百零三年前（一八四〇年）的鴉片戰爭，是一部中國近代史的發端，是一部中國殖民地化歷史的發端。更切實的說，也是英美侵略東亞各國與東亞民族。抗外族侵略的發端。一百零一年後的今年，我們正在大東亞戰爭的決勝關頭，我們正在結束東亞民族百年屈辱史，我們正在以中日協力　基礎而展開建設新中國與新東亞的歷史。在這時期，我們必須淸除鴉片和「精神上之鴉片」遺留在中國和東亞的　害，因爲只有　大這種拒毒運動，才能保障中國和東亞之獨立自由和健全發展。</p>
<p>鴉片最先輸入中國的確實年份，已不易查考，大概在初期，只是作爲一種興奮劑或其他醫藥之用，其禍害尙未十分顯著。可是，到了十九世紀的初期，卽常英國佔領印度並進而向緬甸，西藏，雲南乃至中國本部伸展其侵略的魔手以後，鴉片在中國以至東亞各地，頓時成爲最嚴重的社會問題乃至政治問題。它在印度強迫栽種鴉片，以中國爲最主要的銷售市塲，除了獲得意外的百利以外，更麻醉中國老百姓，造成便於侵略的條件。當時內閣的條件。當時內閣學士兼禮部侍郞朱　上疏，即曾指出：「鴉片之爲物，使國民腐敗，使國民衰弱，有萬害而無一利。赤髯之英夷，以此輸入中國，實如荷蘭人以手段征服爪哇之所爲。故中國亦將陷入此危難之地位。一朱氏並在疏中痛陳：」今也鴉片之毒，使軍隊沈淪於腐敗墮落之淵，官吏與儒生，亦染期毒，一般人民德義上之標準從此低下。」後來林則徐氏之嚴厲查禁，實可說是中國民族第一次對西方侵略勢力的反抗。鴉片戰爭，雖然因爲淸廷之顯預，戰略攻略之晚節而失敗，但在戰爭中，已經喚起了人民對鴉片之毒害的警惕，已經喚起了人民對英國侵略的反抗決心，在英兵暴行之下，曾激起了廣州，佛山，三元里等地人民「平英國」壯烈的起義，給英軍以嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭的慘敗，南京條約屈辱的結果，中國民族開始了百年黑暗痛苦的恥辱生活。直到前年十二月八日，日本發動大東亞戰爭，驅逐東亞區域英美的侵略勢力，於是鴉片戰爭後百年來所加於中國民挨身上的桎梏，才算予以粉碎，中國民族所受的慘痛毒禍，才算予以消除。然而，就目前的的事實而論，英美的侵略勢力，還未完全肅清，重新恢復鴉片戰爭以來的在中國的特權，還在好夢迷戀。同時，就我們國內的實情說，則鴉片戰爭以來，鴉片及其同類毒物，流佈遐邇，深入民間，雖然迭經當局努力勸論查禁，遺毒倘未澈底肅淸，至今西南西北各省，固然尙不少罌粟之田，運土之途，甚且以鴉片稅捐挹注政費，即在和平區內，亦不能說絕對無此現象。這還祗是鴉片毒品等有形之毒害而已，至如精神上深中偕鴉片以俱來的毒素，如懶怠，如浪費，如愚妄，如萎靡，如自私自利，如無公德心，愛國心，凡此等等，對於國家社會所起的消蝕腐敗的作用，實際上亦不下於鴉片，抑且有過之無不及。這種有形的與無形的鴉片之毒，如果不早一日加以澈底的肅淸，那麽，儘管在太平洋上已無英美軍隊的影踪，我們自己澴是毫無辦法。</p>
<p>不問爲有形的毒特，或爲無形的流毒，絕對的要求一律徹底肅清，依據百年來的經騐，深以爲必須注意到以下幾點：第一，拒毒運動，不能偏重於自上而下的政府的法令與刑罰，也不能偏重於無權無威的民間活支，而必須是政府有嚴刑峻法，社會領袖合力督導，才可收到切實的效果。政府領導者之令出必行，尤居最重要的地位。第二，除了上述治標的辦法之外，同時必須共謀根本肅淸鴉片及無形流毒的辦法，這就是一方面提高國民文化水準，使每一個國民都能自覺地了解鴉片之禍害，了解精神上之鴉片之流毒，並且了解如何不受其毒害的方法，進而共謀澈底肅淸這種毒害。另一方面，就要推進新國民運動，用科學事業，體育運動，正當娛樂等等，使鴉片等毒物再沒有誘惑的機會，在一切人民中間起厭惡之感。我們更應提倡科學，昌明醫學，特別是由政府當局與社會有力份子協力，拯救業已淪入黑海的可憐的同胞，而對於一切虛僞的戒烟藥品，對於變相的戒吸所等，更應嚴厲查禁。</p>
<p>拒毒是一種社會運動，但同時也是一種政治運動與文化運動，它的成敗，和國家民族的前途，有非常密切的關聯，也可說是和東亞民族前途有非常密切的關聯。我們必須在這裏提醒國人，如果不立即痛下決心，澈底肅淸有形無形的鴉片之毒，那麽，縱使擊滅了英美的軍隊，也不能就保證中國之復興與東亞的安定的。</p>

<h3>前司法次長張一鵬氏辦焚土情形並擬禁烟辦法呈文</h3>
<p>（載民國八年三月四日政府公報第一千一百零六號）</p>
<p>爲辦理焚土事竣，謹將經過情形，幷擬將來禁絕辦法，詳悉具陳，仰祈鈞鑒事：民國七年十二月三日，奉大總統令，政府前次收買有土，專售爲製藥之用，原爲體恤商艱起見，顧雖慎加考訂，限制綦嚴，而留此根株，誠恐易滋流弊，轉於禁烟前途，不無影響，著內務財政兩部轉飭查明此項存土，現存確數，除已經領售者不計外，其餘均由部派員督視，一律收回，彙集海關，定期悉數銷燬，幷候特派專員，會同地方官及海關稅務司等，公同監視，以昭愼重。此令。等因。奉此，十二月十九日奉國務院函開：案查內務財政兩部呈，焚燬存土請派專員監視一案，奉指令派張一鵬前往監視。此令。等因。奉此，相應函請查照。等因。准此，一鵬遵即束裝帶同隨員司法部秘書蔣中覺等，前赴上海，十二月二十三日抵埠，當即會同內務部委員邵福瀛，財政部委員汪振家，江海關監督馮國勳，交涉員陳貽範，總稅務司威厚瀾等，一再討論，檢一騐焚燬各辦法，分別次序，妥愼將事，以期仰副鈞座廓淸烟毒之至意。節經先後電呈暨回京面復在案。惟此次焚燬存土，以價値計，約計三千餘萬元之鉅，即政府交付洋藥商行之公債票，亦値一千三百餘萬元。以重量計，則有大土一千零十三箱，小土一百九十四箱之多。國家此舉，犧牲如許金錢，付之一炬，良由鴉片爲害中國最烈，不獨鈞座毅力精心，欲爲全國掃除痼疾，即身居局外者，亦莫不深表同情，熱心贊助。乃一鵬抵滬之初，衆議沸騰，肆爲謠諑，或謂偷漏短少，或謂以假易眞，種種舞弊情形，事同目覩，幾令一涉辦理此案之人，即在可毀之列。幷又鼓吹贈土之說，以期破壞焚土之成議。幸政府持之堅定，得貫澈其主張，而一鵬以前决查辦收買存土之人，親歷交涉，稍敢自信，絕不以事體艱難，人言搖惑，稍懈任事之心。因思焚燬雖易，而辦理一有疏漏，即不免諸弊叢生，若不於焚燬之前，詳細查騐，不足以息疑止謗。故定第一步爲查騐，第二步爲焚燬。查騐手續，最爲繁重，舉其大要，則騐法必取精密，而參觀必取普及是也。在精於鑒別者，用手術目力詳細觀察，眞僞即已顯然，猶恐有所未盡，事必有資於化騐，自非聘請專門人才，詳加鑑別不可。乃由英領事法磊司，推薦化學司芙人寳伯來，專任化騐之事，幷請中國著名之化騐師卻兆鴻，卻兆鹍等，復由一鵬密請華商之老於土行者二人，同行鑬定，隨時令作化騐之報吿，此所謂騐法必取精密也。滬上團體林立，而重要者厥惟省議會，省敎育會，南北商會，靑年會，全國聯合禁烟會，均由國務院指定作爲公同監視機關，此外如建設會二十餘團體，亦自行協議，推定代表，輪流監視，又行政各機關及中外旅滬名人，無不敦請到塲，有簽名簿及證明書可證，此所謂參觀必須普及也。又因浦東新舊兩窰，容積過小，需時頗多，乃與稅務司議定添築二窰，以縮短時期，而杜流弊，每窰一日可焚二百箱，雇用火夫四十名，時時撥翻，每窰的翻至三十餘次，以期餘燼悉成枯炭，不復有烟灰之功用。當守候築窰期間，一鵬日與各國領事及各界人物接洽，切實研討，凡有酬酢，無不極力演說，鼓吹國家焚土禁烟之盛意。復由一鵬手訂監視焚土規則十三條，呈請施行，並製備各種入塲徽章，俾到塲參觀之人，略有秩序，此檢騐焚燬以前之籌備情形也。迨一切布置旣備，當於八年一月八日，開始查騐，所有滬上存土計共兩宗，一存怡和新棧，一存沙遜棧，爰先從怡和查騐，是日美法瑞典領事及中外名人，暨各機關代表，均皆到塲參觀，塲內秩序齊整，共查騐怡和存土計大土四十二箱，小土二箱，每箱劈開時，均由一鵬手自查騐，遞與參觀者輪流觀看，已騐之土，仍裝原箱，四周貫以鉛絲，包以蔴袋，總縫處烙以錫塊，由一鵬及稅務司同蓋圖章，辦理至爲愼密。每箱剖騐，自五個至十餘個不等，有可疑者均由寳伯來當塲化騐，衆目共覩。九日查騐存土八十箱，十日查騐六十四箱，十一日查騐一百箱，十二日查騐一百十二箱，十三日查騐五十三箱，十四日查騐九十五箱，十五日查騐九十四箱，合計怡和存士查騐完竣。其中雖有分量過輕之大士七個，經稅司當衆將全箱逐個稱準剖騐，並無弊混，均經電聞在案，因恐兩棧悉數騐畢，始付焚燬，日期相隔較長，設備或恐不周，爰於十七日起，將已騐之土，運往浦東汽窰焚燬。是日上午八時由副稅司克利亞在怡和棧照料，將大土一百箱運義駁船，用小輪拖帶渡浦，沿途有工部局派捕並暗探等密爲保護，浦中有海關水巡隊，焚燒處有警廳遊巡隊，護軍使之軍士，地方檢察廳之司法警察，並浦東巡警，相互巡邏，防護甚爲周密。迨存土運到，先由一鵬及稅司逐箱檢驗鉛烙錫印，將箱劈開，由一鵬會同稅司將土投入窰內焚燬，十八日焚大土一百二十箱，十九日焚大小土二百箱，二十日焚大小土二百二十二箱，通共怡和存土六百四十二箱，焚燬盡凈。隨將沙遜存土開始檢騐，視務司因沙遜棧房狹小，檢騐監視難容多人，力請移入怡和棧內辦理。因查沙遜所存係待騐之土，先行移動，尙無關係，當有皓電呈明照准。即經運入怡和棧內，二十一日上午剖騐大土七十箱，下午剖騐大土四十一箱，其剖騐手續仍照前决辦理，先將士箱啓蓋，倒入木斗內，以手術檢視，設有疑義，即行剖開，傳觀公衆，時塲中有來賓聲請可吾將箱內倒出之土，任人指剖，當令指剖數個，並無弊混。二十二日查騐一百四十二箱，二十三日查騐一百四十一箱，二十四日查騐一百四十箱，連前三日爲五百六十五箱，連第一次共騐大土一千零十三箱，內　四十四個，小土一百九十四箱，內計一萬九千三百七十斤零十二兩，又煤」箱，大土均與册報相符，小土溢出二百四十六斤十二兩，均無弊混，當將續騐之土，於二十五日運往浦東汽窰焚燬，計至二十七日止，竭三日之力，焚燬完竣，所遺灰燼，連日均經海關化騐師勞勃生，中國化騐師卻兆鴻，卻兆鹍，技師邵仲鼎等，詳加化騐，實騐得此項灰燼，經過烈火土質，效力全失，已成廢物，因爲愼重起見，故飭將兩次燒存餘灰，由窰內起出，沃灌滷汁，裝盛蒲袋，投畀大海，此兩次檢騐焚燒之實施情形也。此次焚土之舉，各國參觀士紳，多能冒雪衝寒，逐日參列，無不交口騰聲，額手稱慶。至有檢取木皮鉛片，以爲保存紀念者，中外報館記者逐日到塲，奮筆記錄，幷有照相技師，將逐日檢騐焚燬各事，印入活動影片，以期傳播各國，而總稅務同　厚瀾君，尤爲始終勤　，凡執重要職務之人，上自員司，下至苦力，均經事前訓練，且多係由天津·漢口·蕪湖各關調來，故與上海土著經無關係，每日服務自晨迨暮，雖星期亦不休息，此實我大總統力除烟害，誠信所孚，示禁絕之決心，爲曠世之盛舉，故能中外一致，得吿成功也。國家爲人民廓淸烟害計，不惜虛糜如許國帑，買收焚燬，固已銷一時之囤積，聳四方之觀聽矣。若不預籌善後辦法，爲杜絕將來之計，特恐事過境遷，潛根猶伏？因籌議辦法兩項：一爲積極辦法，請更定鴉片單行法，以懲治烟犯也。查暫行新刑律第二十一章，鴉片烟罪十條，對於製造，販賣，及吸烟等罪，規定過輕，殊非刑亂用中之道。製造販賣者，其刑期最高度僅至三等，而開設館舍供人吸食及吸食鴉片烟者，其刑期最低度僅至拘役，立法過寬，人民易生泄玩，不得不嚴定加重專條，以救其弊。擬請援照懲治盜匪法，特定一懲治鴉片烟罪法，務使國民懷於重刑，而烟害無復傳播。一爲消極辦法，擬請飭內務部通飭各省地方，多辦良善之醫院也。多立醫院，籌款固屬爲難，使吸烟者果得有効戒烟之所，需款雖鉅，亦不難於一籌，因不吸烟者，甚願吸者之戒除，必樂爲贊助。吸老恨受毒之深，久亦必願解囊，以求其成。進而言之，雖已身不吸之人，必不能保子孫之必不吸食，已吸者亦不願子孫之再吸，苟有良好之方法，及可信任之醫院，想不論已吸未吸之人，必能竭力響助也。以上二條，僅就管見所及，上陳鈞聽，以佛高深之采擇。除化騐師寳伯來具有化騐證書，卻兆鹍烟土分析說明書及化騐原質玻璃管八僩，技術員邵世銘報告書，上海各團體聯合會監視報吿，又簽名簿隨案具陳外，所有此次辦理焚土事竣，將經過情形及籌議禁絕辦法各緣由，理合呈，伏乞大總統鑒核，訓示遵行。謹呈·八年二月十八日，已奉指令。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　日故山本元帥之國葬典禮，在日舉國哀悼中，定六月五日隆重舉行。溯日本自明治十六年岩倉具視公爵以元勳資格首次蒙賜國葬以來，迄今除皇族好臣下蒙賜國葬之榮者，計有公卿二人，藩主三人，政治家三人，軍人三人，於最前綫戰死而蒙賜國葬者，黃以山本元帥爲第一人。在日本所謂「國葬」普通之解釋爲「以國帑爲治喪費」之意，但其眞正精神則爲舉國一致表示衷意之葬儀，亦即國家之葬儀。又日本一般人每認國葬典禮爲臣下所制定者，但實則係以關於業經規定之皇室葬儀爲主，至於臣下之國葬則爲特例。日本國葬制度，在最初並未有一定規定，及至大正十五年（民國十五年）制定國葬令後，始明示其原則，其中並規定分爲當然國葬及經特旨恩賜國葬二種。當然國葬係指合於日本國葬令第一條「大喪儀」之規定及第二條中「在皇族中關於特經指定者之葬儀」而言，故雖爲皇族亦未必行國葬。至於經特旨恩賜之國葬，則係根據國葬令第三條所規定之「凡有偉勳於國家者，當其薨逝時，得以特旨賜予國葬，此項特旨以勅書頒發後，再由內閣總理大臣將其公吿」。所謂「有偉勳於國家者」，必須爲國家之柱石，建有偉大功績，爲全國民衆所一致景仰者，故執行國葬時，實可視爲被授與如憲法第十五條中之「爵位勳章及其他榮典」之榮譽相同。此項榮譽之內容，一爲以國幣爲治喪費，二爲指定國家官吏以辦理喪務，其中經費一項，在議會開會期間，作爲追加預算，提交議會，在議會閉期間，則從第二預備費項中撥付，而要求下屆議會加以承認。又當決定國葬後，同時則由政府任命葬儀正副委員長曁各葬儀委員及職員等，其中委員長一職，任命興薨逝者有親密關係之大員担任，副委員長一職，則向例任命內閣書記官長担任，委員則任命內閣及宮內省其他與薨逝者有關係之官員担任，且因國葬爲國家之儀式，故以神式執行國葬典禮之程序規定爲：當日首由天皇陛下之勅使參拜，繼由皇后陛下並皇太后陛下曁各皇族殿下之勅使致奠後，即由遺族捧呈供神之幣，其後即爲各國駐日大。公使等分別代表其國家禮拜，各大員捧呈供神之幣，至於一般民衆，則於典禮完畢後捧呈。又根據日國葬令第四條在舉行國葬之當日，天皇陛下廢朝，全國並停止娛樂，故國葬典禮實爲異常隆重之特典。日本臣下之得蒙恩賜國葬，實爲無上光榮，此次故山本元帥之國葬，在日本頒發國葬令之勅令後，爲繼東鄉元帥，西園寺公後之第三人。</p>
<h3>山本元帥國葬日　首都下半旗誌哀</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　中國方面爲表示哀悼日故山本元帥，已決定在山本元帥國葬日，各機關，學校，公司等，均下半旗以誌哀悼，並定五日上午十時五十分，全國一致停止娛樂。又國府汪兼行政院院畏亦預定與日東條首相，滿張國務總理，泰國畢本首相等發表廣播講演，以讚揚山本元帥之偉績，闡明大東亞戰爭必勝之決意，俾促我國國民奮起。又南京日僑亦定五日停止一切娛樂，各戶懸掛國旗誌哀，上午十時四十分東條首相奉奠時，齊集第一國民學校舉行遙拜式，默禱山本元帥英名不朽。</p>
<p>南京二日中央社電　南京佛敎聯合會，爲追念日山本元帥生前功績，定四日下午八時，在南京英靈奉安所召開追悼大會，又日本駐華大使館海軍武官前田少將，亦定於三日下午二時半接見記者，發表談話。</p>
<h3>任海長談話</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　任海長頃對山本元帥及山崎部隊長之壯烈殉國精神，發表談話如下：此次山本元帥之戰死及山崎部隊在阿圖島之壯烈犧牲，吾人對之實不勝欽佩感槪，山本元帥及山崎大佐實充分表現吾友邦民族浩然之氣，即吾人平素習聞之大和魂與武士道也。但吾中華民族在古代亦不乏此種偉大壯烈之前例，楚漢相爭時田橫五百壯士之慷槪就義，與夫魯仲連之義不帝秦，寗蹈杭海而死之誓言，皆與今日之山崎部隊相類似，也可見我東亞民族之祖先，實皆具備此偉大精神，凡吾袍澤，皆應取法景仰而接受此種精神，以完遂大東亞戰爭。</p>
<h3>淸鄕事務局長　汪曼雲談話</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　汪曼雲氏自淸鄉委會成立後，即榮任副秘書長之職，此次出任淸鄉事務局局長，中央記者昨往訪，承發表談話略謂；溯自前年五月，國民政府特設淸鄉委員會，七月開始淸鄉，至本年五月，恰値兩週年，在此兩年之間，淸鄉工作，始於江蘇省之第一期，由太倉·常熟·吳縣·崑山·各縣起，沿京滬綫逐漸拓展至太湖東南地區，現在上海·浙江·蘇北·鎮江·浙東·安徽均在相繼舉行，而湖北·廣東·亦在準備與籌辦之中·大東亞戰爭開始，及我國參戰以來，淸鄉工作不但成爲國民政府重要工作之一，亦爲協力大東亞戰爭，安定後方秩序工作之一，現淸鄉區域逐漸擴大，事務日趨繁賾。最高國防會議決議將淸鄉委員會結束，所有淸鄉事務，移歸行政院統率，以收統籌兼顧之效。基此原因，行政院特設置淸鄉事務局，惟本局與過去淸鄉委員會性質不同，過去淸鄉委員會爲一執行機關，現在淸鄉事務局則爲計劃及審議機關，本人承乏局長，深恐菲才，惟有仰承最高領袖之指示，竭盡所能，勉圖貢獻。</p>

<h3>海軍魂　（八）　海軍魂之眞諦</h3>
<p>— 藤田嗣治</p>
<p>武漢三鎭被落日本帝國陸海軍精銳陷的民國二十七年十月二十六日的晚上，我被海軍派遺進漢口。掩蔽着漢口與武昌的一片雨和雲，被市內上昇的無數火熖映照着，眞是一個凄慘的黃昏。旗艦〇〇號的〇〇司令官曾很親熱地歡迎我們。甚至允許參加那個慶祝夜宴。艦長先讓我沐浴。這種感激莫銘的一夜，很安謐地入睡了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，我醒轉來時吃了一驚。我的褲子由水手弟兄的手，板板正正地折壘起來，且用熨斗燙平，手帕給洗得雪白，壘成四方而放在枕頭傍通。把飯裝在兩層的盒子裏準備漢口登陸了。</p>
<p>即在這種激烈作戰中，海軍軍人的日常生活仍然絲毫未變，其用心周到，任何一處都整然不紊。單純勇敢善鬥並非是海軍魂，我在內心裏細味這種意義，而且不勝感激。（濤：譯朝日新聞）</p>

<p>漢口二日中央社電　華中方面日軍展開夏季攻勢時，日陸軍水上部隊會駕駛扣留在宜昌方面之美英船舶五十餘艘，由長江下航參加作戰。當時渝（第六戰區）江防軍會據守宜昌方面峻嶺頑强抵抗，但被日軍節節擊破，故水上部隊終於完全達到下航之目的。日海軍部隊於發動開始岳州沙市間之水路作戰後，日陸軍水上部隊亦於上月某日，耶開始在長江濁浪中從事約百卅公里之下航作戰，終於某日下午安然抵達某地。此次華中方面日軍建立收獲五十餘艘數萬噸之大戰果，非但可增強將來輸送之力量，即影響於各方面者極巨。五十餘艘船舶毫無損害，即可將其使用，而其使用價値亦極大。按此次船舶大部爲英船，間有小部美船。</p>

<h3>各方救濟華北災荒　糧食問題解決有望</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　關於華北食糧救濟問題，政府前以社會福利部實業部糧食部等生管機關爲中心，圓滑進行中。上海方面，亦因財界有力善士，慷慨捐輸，其成數約有數千萬元之多。全華北準備之救災用麵粉，爲數頗巨，聞近將開始向華北遝輸，現正與華北政委會商討輸運方法。此外政府當局並會以相當數量之雜糧，運向華北，第一次業已實行，第二次正籌備中。又本年春季，華北農產綜合收成，亦經調查，小麥總產量約六百九十萬噸，預計可較往年增加一成有餘，其他農產物之收獲，預卜亦可樂觀。華北食糧問題，將因增產與中央救濟而全部解決也。</p>

<h3>第三國際解散　中共緊急會議</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　第三國際解散消息傳至後，中共所受衝動甚大，關於今後應循之途徑，內部意見紛歧，莫衷一是。頃悉中共幹部於五月廿六日召開緊急會議時，全體一致決議，擁護蘇聯所採措置，並召開幹事會議，追認上述決議事項，聞決議內容約爲下列四點：（一）中共全面支持蘇聯此次措置，並解除第三國際之規定及決議之各種義務。（二）第三國際之歷史使命業已完成，中共於一九二四年以來即努力一切，但目下國際情勢複雜，以旣存之組織，達成勞動運動，實不可能，故今後應以結成反法西斯戰綫爲目標，動員廣泛之民衆，爭取最後勝利。（三）由於此次第三國際解散，中共今後益表强化與民衆之連繋以充實實力。按自解散第三國際事實證明後，一般視聽，即注於渝共關係之轉變，，照過去渝共相尅之情形而觀，則斷定此次中共之決議內容，除欲乘機作進一步之謀略，以壓制渝方外，實毫無其他意義可言，因此吾人益信渝共關係前途暗礁之愈益增多，亦必山此而始。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　據福岡電話，菲島軍政監部產業部長山越道之氏，頃歸國商洽要務，業於一日自馬尼拉搭機飛抵福岡，據稱：菲島產業乃置重點於農業，自去年五月佔領科列基多島後，菲鳥即爲確立食糧自給自足之體制，而展開食糧增產運動，呂宋島向有菲島穀倉之稱，本年稻之收獲，巳達預期以上之良好成績，故預想本年中，菲島食糧自給自足之體制即可確立。此外，棉花一項，去年在軍政監部指導下，已收獲相當數量，本年更決定實行大規模之種植。又如砂糖等之生產，亦均順利，而砂糖一項除食用者外，且可充作原料，故對該項之生產，更力謀增强。又一般民衆亦已紛紛展開食糧之自給自足運動，此足見彼等已理解我國眞意，而自願獻身協力故由此以觀，解決菲島食糧問題非難事。</p>
<h3>軸心記者　論印緬局勢</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　英·美方面於本年初，曾迭次高呼奪回緬甸，但今日之事實演變，實與其所夢想者相反，緬印國境之敵軍，屢次敗戰，形勢愈見不利。關於此事，此開德國時報於一日特刋一評論，謂印度之危機日見增加，因之美國對助印度之力，亦須漸形增大，時至今日，日本實有代英而取之勢。最近英印軍司令官華維爾及其僚屬，曾聲言將日軍完全逐出緬甸，然據時事新報特派員之報道，則謂事實與此完全相反，過去五個月間，英軍於印緬國境方面之戰爭，可謂戰無不敗，且因日空軍之猛炸吉大港及其他軍事要地，均受重大損害，且日軍之森林戰術尤爲巧妙，反軸心軍實無策與之相抗。西班牙周報記者，近受英·美方面之招待，曾經歷印度內地，據該記者之報吿，亦謂印度民衆已漸理解日本之眞意及實力，現彼等均認爲日本乃協力印度獨立之唯一友隣，故印度親日情緒日見濃厚。以言印度之現狀，其軍事則悉受日軍之重壓，政治上，民衆已漸醒覺，已了解大東亞共榮圈之眞意，經濟上，則英·美之勢力，正在互相傾軋</p>

<h3>德海軍總司令　竇尼資發表談話</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　據此間朝日新聞社柏林專電稱：德海軍總司令竇尼資元帥所掌職責至爲重大，除相當於日本之軍令部總長及海相外，並直接負責指輝德潛艇隊作戰，實爲德海軍界之第一人。記者於二十一日往訪，承元帥於百忙中抽暇接見，此爲元帥於就任海軍總司令後第一次接見記者，並承發表談話如次：德海軍全體將士，對於山本聯合艦隊司令長官之英勇殉國，至爲欣佩，本屆日本海軍紀念日，曾發表日本海軍於此次戰爭中所獲之偉大綜合戰果，余思此實爲使山本元帥之偉勳永傳不朽之紀念碑，余前向日本海軍所致之祝電，即在將吾人感銘及信賴之心意，傳達於貴國。當德國爲英國所擊而奮起作戰時，乃不得不以重建之小量海軍與之抗戰，其時英法艦隊擁有之實力，僅於北海及大西洋方面者，即達德海軍之十倍，但吾人並不畏懼，自開戰之日起，德海軍即以閃電戰自敵軍方而奪得主動地位，而奇襲英土之斯卡巴夫羅軍港，佔領敵軍之上陸基地挪威海岸，完成自北方威脅英戰土之形勢，繼以大西洋島爲根據地，展開令人最畏懼之潛艇戰，對敵生命之動脈海上交通不斷予以猛烈打撃，德潛艇隊所建之偉勳，已久爲世所共知，於此已無贅言之必要。當德潛艇威脅英本土之際，美國認爲若假此時機威脅日本，必可使其屈服，但此實爲反軸心陣營之根本錯誤，因此美國遂亦參戰。其時德人即相信日本必可以其強力及決心予美國之傲慢態度以重大打撃，當吾人將日本海軍在太平洋上所獲之偉大戰果及德潛艇隊在大西洋上所建之偉勳合而爲一，靜加考慮時，則可知在此次世界大戰中，日·德·義三過海軍決非各自單獨作戰，而係東西相呼應，到處打擊英·美軍艦及商船，使敵方實力日益衰弱，軸心陣營之呼應作戰，終必使敵軍實力歸於消滅。當記者謂軸心國迄今所擊沉之敵船巳達三千已百五＋萬噸，並以之叩詢對潛艇戰之意見時，竇尼資謂：吾人擊沉敵方如此大量船舶，敵方雖盡力研究防禦對策及添造新船，但連不能償其所失，尤爲吾人所深感者，即日本對於此項偉大戰果所建立之功勳，亦至爲偉大，其決定海上戰鬥之勝負者，則將視最後之戰果如何而定也。故德潛艇刻仍在不斷打擊敵人之中，余確信軸心各國在將來之海戰中，實具有絕對不敗之精神與實力，吾人之戰爭目的絕不稍動，任何時俱集中於同一目標，吾人之至上目標，即爲奮戰到底，以爭取最後勝利。氏末復談及阿圖島日守軍全體壯烈殉國一事謂，日軍將士在此次正義戰爭中，所作犧牲，決非偶然，余深爲阿圖島一役所感動，阿圖島日軍勇士於此役中已向世界再度闡明，古代日本之武士道精神，今日依然沸騰於日人血夜之中　　，凡稍知日本歷史者，莫不知此次日軍勇士遠離祖國於阿圖島方面壯烈殉國之事，必使日本舉國民衆益堅其擊滅敵人之鬥志，而日本全軍士氣亦必因此更趨旺盛。</p>

<p>奏爲遵旨在粵銷燬煙土，會督文物大員，公同目拏，巖實稽查，以杜弊混，而昭震襲，現在銷化已將及半，先行恭摺奏祈聖鑒事：竊臣等前奏收繳夷船煙土，請將原箱解京，先於四月十二日奉到硃批，已蒙諭旨允准，謹即欽遵辦理，業經收拾裝載，正在奏報起運間，復於十八日承准軍機處咨開：內閣奉上諭，前據林則徐等馳奏躉船鴉片，盡數呈繳，請解京騐明燒燬，當降旨允行。本日據御史鄧瀛奏稱：廣東距京程途遼遠，所繳煙土爲數較多，恐委員稽察雖周，易啓偷漏抽換之弊，等語。林則徐等經朕委任，此次查辦粵洋煙土，甚屬認眞，朕斷不疑其稍有欺飾，且長途轉運，不無借資民力，著無庸解送來京，即交林則徐，鄧廷楨，怡良，於收繳完峻後，即在該處督率文武員弁，公同查覆，目撃燒燬，俾沿海居民及在粵夷人，共見共聞，咸知震　。該大臣等唯當仰體朕意，　實稽查，斷不准在事員弁人等，稍滋弊混，欽此。仰見我皇上於　實除害之中，寓體恤民力之意。臣等公同跪誦，欽感難名。伏思銷燬煙土，弊竇最多，必須在在嚴防，庶可免於偷漏。緣此物流行已久，利之所在，衆庶爭趨。查道光十七年間，臣鄧廷楨等曾經奏明，奸民向夷船購買鴉片，從前每個價值洋銀三十餘元，近來止須十六十八元不等，今即以錢價覆算，每箱亦須六百餘元，合計二萬餘箱，不下一千數百萬元之值。在守正嫉邪之人，不惟糞上棄之，且以鴆毒視之；而吸食者則竟望而垂涎，興販者更欲居爲奇貨，若防範稍不嚴密，即百弊爲之叢生。臣等自收繳以來，固虎門越在海濱，須防奸民覬覦，即先相度堆貯之地，計每箱長約三尺，高寬半之，大房一問，才能堆至四五百箱之數。該處民房廟宇，均無寬敞可容，不得已合併數所，廟築外牆，添蓋高棚，勻排封貯，內派文職正佐十二員，分棚看守，外派武職十員，帶領弁兵一百名，盡夜巡邏，幸尚不至疎處。至銷燬之方，亦復熟籌屢試，向來用火銷化，并以桐油，其法未嘗不善，第訪聞焚過之後，必有殘膏餘瀝滲入地中，積慣熬煎之人，竟能掘地取土，十得二三，是流毒仍難盡絕。臣等廣諮博採，知鴉片最忌者二物：一曰鹽滷，一曰石灰。凡以煙土煎膏者。投以灰鹽，即成渣沬，必不能收合成膏，是其相剋之性，正可資之以除其害也。然使逐箱煙土，皆用灰煙煮化，則鍋　之設必須累百盈千，誠恐照管不周，轉滋偷漏。如其少設；又非數月不能銷完。茲再四酌商，莫若於海灘高處，挑挖兩池，輪流浸化，其他平鋪石底；縱構各十五丈餘尺，四旁欄樁釘板，不令少有滲漏，前面設一涵洞，後面通一水溝，池岸周圍，廣樹柵欄，中設棚廠數座，爲文武員弁查視之　　所。其浸化之法，先由溝道車水入池，撒鹽成滷，所有箱內煙土，逐箇切成四瓣，投入滷中，泡浸中日，再將整塊燒透，石灰紛紛拋下，頃刻便如湯沸，不爨自燃。復盧人夫多名，各執鐵鋤木爬，立於跳板之上，往來翻裁，務使顆粒悉化，俟至退潮時候，啓放涵洞，隨浪送出大洋，並用淸水刷滌池底，不任涓滴留餘，若甲日第一池，尚未刷淸，乙日便用第二池　其泡浸翻裁，悉如前法，如此輪流替換，每化一池，必淸一池之底，始免套塔牽混，滋生弊端。至嚮晦停工，即將池岸四圍柵欄，全行封鎖，派令文武員弁，周歷巡查。粵東天氣炎熱，所用人夫，僅穿短褲，上身下腳，向俱赤露，又於停工放出時，與執事工役一同搜檢，不許稍有夾帶，試行之初，每日才化三四百箱，迨數日後，手法漸熟，現在日可八九百箱至千箱不等。當其銷鎔之際，濃油上湧，渣涬下沉，臭穢熏騰，不可嚮邇，乃悟此物之能蠱人心志，促人年壽，槁人形骸者，蓋製造時用物取精，別有奇義方術，非僅如內地裁種器粟，刮漿熬製巳也。臣林則徐駐劄虎門，與提臣關天培率同委員候補知府南雄，直隸州知州余保純等，逐加佈置，隨即函商臣鄧廷楨，臣怡良，以欽奉諭旨，公同目撃銷燬，是在省各員理宜輪流到虎，查嚴看視，臣怡良因前次銷燬時，商明留省，此次輪應先到虎門，臣鄧廷楨於臣怡良回省後，亦即乘舟來虎，並令藩司熊常錞，臬司喬用遷，運司陳嘉樹，糧道王篤四員，分班輪往，接替查視。又咨會廣州將軍臣德克金布，左翼副都統臣奕湘，右翼副都統臣英降，亦各輸流到虎，稽杳彈壓。粵海關監書臣豫堃，則以虎門本有稅口，更應常川到彼照料，稽查在事員弁人等，均各派定執司，亙相查覈。該處沿海居民，觀者如堵，只准在柵欄之外，不許混人廠中，以杜偷漏。其上省下澳，夷人經過口門，率皆遠觀，而不敢褻玩。察其情狀，似有羞惡之良。胥賴聖主德威，俾中外咸知震聲。從此洗心革面，庶幾咸與維新矣。至煙土名色，亦有不同，其黑者曰公斑土，聞係上等之煙，白土次之，金花土又次之，此次劈箱銷化，當將各色煙土分別編號登記，大抵公土白土居多，金花土不及百分之一，業已逐箱過秤，並口袋所裝者，亦皆扣除箱袋，覈實凈煙斤兩，計自四月二十二日起，截至五月初三日，已銷過八千三百二十箱，又二千一百一十九袋，其斤兩共合一百十二萬八千七百二十九斤，以全數覈之，所化已將及半，現仍趕緊銷化，不敢草率，亦不敢遷延，恐風聖懷，謹將現辨情形合詞恭摺具奏。伏乞皇上聖鑒。謹奏。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>奏爲虎門銷化煙土，公同覈實稽查，現已一律完竣，恭摺奏祈聖鑒事。竊臣等欽遵諭旨，將夷船繳到煙土二萬餘箱，在粵銷燬，所有覈實杜弊，並會督文武大員，公同目擊情形，已於五月初三日銷化及半之時，先行恭摺會奏在案，嗣是仍照前法劈箱過秤，將煙土切碎，拋入石池，泡以鹽滷，爛以石灰。統俟戳化成渣，於退潮時送出大　。臣等會督文武員弁，遂日到廠看視稽查其間非無人夫乘機圖竊，而執事員弁，多人留神偵察，是以當塲拿獲之犯，前後共有十餘名，均即立予嚴行懲治。並有賊匪於貯煙處所，乘夜爬牆，鑿箱偷土，亦經內外看守各員弁，巡獲破案，現准發司嚴審，尤當按律重辦，其遠近民人來廠觀看者，端節前後，愈見其多，無不肅然懍畏。並有咪喇堅國之夷商　與哵　呅　　等，携帶眷口由澳門乘巫舳板，向沙角守口之水師提標游擊羊英科遞稟，求許入棚瞻視，臣等先因欽奉諭旨，准令在粵夷人共見共聞，咸知震襲，曾經出示曉諭，是以該夷等遵諭前來，且查夷商經等，平素係作正經買賣，不販鴉片，人所共知，因准派員帶赴池旁，使其看明切土搗爛，及撤鹽燃灰諸法，該夷人等咸知一一點頭，且皆時時掩鼻，旋至臣等廠前，摘帽歛手，似以表其畏服之滅，當今通事傳諭該夷等以現在天朝禁絕鴉片，新例極嚴，不但爾等素不販賣之人，永遠不可夾帶，更須傳諭各國夷人，從此專作正經貿易，獲利無窮，萬不可冒禁營私，自投法網。該夷人等傾耳敬聽，俯首輸誠，察其情形，頗知傾心向化。隨即公同賞給事物，歡欣祇領而去。至臣等前奏煙土名色，本有三種，曰公斑，曰白土，曰金化，迨後復經劈出原箱，另有一種小公斑每箱貯八十個，其式樣比行常之公斑較小而個數倍之。故每箱斤兩，不相上下，每個用洋布包裹，製造亦較精緻。訪聞此種在外國係最上之煙，價值極貴，是現在所化煙土，竟有四種，臣等近日於邸鈔中伏讀上諭，煙膏煙具，多有假造，其弊不可勝言等因，鈇此，仰見聖明務求眞實，力戒欺朦之至意。臣等愚昧之見，欲辨其偽，必須先識其眞，未知近時各處所拿獲者，皆係何種煙上，若以外夷原箱之物，互相比較，則眞偽似可立辨，不至混渚，謹將現在四種煙土每種各留兩箱，可否即將此入箱作爲樣土，如蒙准令解京，即委便員搭解，並不費事，倘亦無須解送則此時粵東每月俱有各屬拿獲解省騐燬之煙，也可隨同銷化，現除暫存此八箱外，計已化煙土湊合前奏之數，共有一萬九千一百七十九箱，二千一百一十九袋，其斤兩除去箱袋，實共二百三十七萬六千二百五十四斤，截至五月十五日，業已銷化全完。斯時蕩穢滌瑕，幸免毒流於四海，此後除奸　　拯溺，尤期約立於三章，庶幾仰副我聖主除害保民之至意。所有銷化煙土完竣緣由，臣等謹會同水師提督臣關天培，粵海關監督臣豫堃，合詞恭摺具奏，伏乞皇上聖鑒訓示，再虎門現在無事，臣林則徐亦暫回省城商辨已切。合併聲明。謹奏。</p>

<h3>滬華北急賑會成立　籌賑加緊進行　集中各界領袖力量　按照計劃急速勸募</h3>
<p>本市各界鑒於華北災況嚴重，爲集中力量統籌急賑經費起見，經社會福利部丁部長來滬指示籌賑辦法，並與關係各方接洽就緒後，對組織上海各界華北急賑會，於昨（二）日下午五時，假康樂酒家舉行成立大會，到本市各界領袖二百餘人，陳市（趙秘書長代表）丁部長特躬臨致訓，當塲推選理事·常務理事·及主席團，並通過組織章程，籌募方案等，情形熱烈，預計於最短期間，籌集鉅款。詳情如次：</p>
<p>開會情形</p>
<p>首推舉協助履登爲臨時主席，報告開會宗旨，繼由召集人林康侯報告，即通過組織章程，籌募方案，并推行理事，常務理事，及主席團，旋由主席團袁履登報告重要職員名單，理事會代表張一鵬致詞，後請陳市長代表趙秘書長曁丁部長相繼致詞，嗣主席團李思浩致詞畢，進用茶點，至七時許始散。</p>
<p>首次常會</p>
<p>會後即舉行第一次常務理事會議，陳市長代表趙秘書長及丁部長亦躬親參與，到全體常務理事，全部重要職員亦告列席，由主席團袁履登主席，即席討論決議要案三起，計（一）討論會所，設天后宮橋市商會內，（二）指定代收捐款銀行錢莊，（甲）銀行，計中國·交通·大陸·金城·上海商業·浙江興業·中國工業·四明·中國墾業·五洲·長城·大中·中南等銀行，（乙）錢莊，計福源·同潤·等莊，（三）定每星期四下午四時召開常務理事會議。</p>
<p>代收捐款辦法，除上列各行莊外，常務會議並決定各報代收捐款，照常進行。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>臨時主席袁履首先致詞，略謂「今日大會，在座各位均已明瞭開會意義及目的，故對華北急賑，此舉殊爲義不容辭，上次在國際飯店舉行談話茶會，徵取各方意見，經一度接洽後，始於本日成立組織，承各方熱烈進行，全市各報莫不對華北急賑消息予以刊載，雖本市至今捐款者有數十萬元，但對本市各方之表示同情，已深切透示，除有熱忱慈善家協力相助解囊外，且有無論老幼各界及苦力等紛紛節省靡費捐輸，今旣有長官倡導於先，今後爲健全幹部組織，故有成立上海各界華北急賑會，冀盼各位積極勸募，不斷進行，今日承踴躍參加，深爲感謝。」</p>
<p>林康侯詞</p>
<p>繼由召集人林康侯報行，略謂「賑濟華北災況，賴當地父老熱忱協力，於今日成立，上海各界華北急賑會，最近爲積極組織，曾一度召開籌備會，且經丁部長在首都接洽獲得頭緒，故對華北急賑任務，應急速進行，救災如救火，故我人應急起直追，政府雖已將相當食糧輸送華北賑濟，我人更希望政府再接再厲，不斷將物品糧食從速輸運，冀解危被難災民，然政府旣負此重大責任，我人當應促成政府早已完成，最大之期望，當賴在座各位之熱忱協助政府進行，急起直追，加急組成基幹，各人應盡本位工作，努力踴躍，向各方勸募。」</p>
<p>趙秘書詞</p>
<p>陳市長代表趙秘書長致詞略謂：「關於賑濟華北，上次與丁部長召集各位舉行談話會，徵取意見，決以集中力量進行，計（一）主張加緊組織，時間越速越佳，（二）籌募方法，從速進行，（三）加緊籌糧募款，將食糧早日運送華北，以集合政府力量人民力量，在同一步驟下推展，上海一隅不乏樂善好施善士，故對華北災民被難，莫不深表同情，經短短時間籌，今日成立組織，故在前雖爲計劃，今後乃須根照計劃實行，積極功募，無論勸募款，從事採辦，運輸食糧，擴大宣傳等之機構，即應於明日起分頭工作，一體爲災民着想，於此，對華北急賑方始有效，俾獲得良好成績」。</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>丁部長致詞，略謂「上海各界華北急賑會，經過三星期準備，今日始告成立，今有華北急賑會組織，集各界領袖力量，對於賑濟華北，一定有很多幫助，此乃可以預定及斷言者，關於賑災方面，各方都希望能將食糧多多運輸，最近糧食部方面，已設法購辦一批，立刻就可輸運，不過爲數不多，以後當隨時繼續運送，至華北災情，福利部曾派人前往視察，業已返部，有頗多材料，將來當予公布，最後，希望華北急賑會成立後，能以最速最佳之方法，以底於成」。</p>
<p>張一鵬詞</p>
<p>今日在京外長官提倡指導之下，把這華北數千萬飢民延頸翹企的上海各界急賑籌募的機構，完全成立了，從此上海各界同情的熱心人士，有了一個集中的秩序，良可欣慰。我們聽到華北四省災荒的慘狀，究竟不曾親身見到，但是我們大半多是避難而來的，人民最痛苦的，無過天災人禍，水旱是天災，兵　是人禍，碰到人福，只有逃難，擁到天災，只有逃　，這滋味並不兩樣，可是逃難雖苦，還不至於絕食，逃荒則到處沒有飯吃，逃難而死的人數，究屬有限，逃荒則隨逃隨死，所以逃荒比逃難的慘痛，還要增加十百倍，我們幸而死裏逃生，在這裏有吃有用，兩相比較，自然而然要把華北急賑當作自己的惟一義務了。現在理事會的責任，只有一個速字，至於捐款，我想一定容易推動，能辦得愈快，方是救人救澈，這是我們應當互相督促勉勵的。</p>
<p>華北急賑會組織章程</p>
<p>第一條，本會以籌募華北災荒急賑經費爲宗旨。第二條，本會設理會若干人，常務理事十五人至十九人，常務理事并互推主席團三人，負日常會務推進之責。第三條，本會設書記長一人，副書記長二人由常務理事會選派理事兼任之，秉承常務理事會之命，辦理日常事務。第四條，本會設左列各組：（一）總務組，辦理文書庶務人事及不屬於其他各組事項，（二）財務組，辦理會費及捐款之出納保管事項，（三）宣傳組，辦理一切宣傳事項，（四）交際組，辦理對外交際事項，（五）稽核組，辦理會費及捐款之稽查審核事項。第五條，前條各組各設主行一人副主任一人或二人，各組并設幹事助理各若干人，以向向機關團體調用爲原則，槪不支薪，但得酌給津貼。第六條，本會因籌募經費或辦理各種遊藝事項得設立各委員會。第七條，本會常務理事會每週舉行會議一次，由主席團召集之。第八條，本會會址。第九條，本會於籌募經費結束之日撤銷之。</p>

<p>上海·大連都市對抗競技大會委員會名譽會長陳公博（上海市長，）矢野征記（在上海日本總領事，）會長綱崎勝男，（中支那日本人陸上競技協會名譽會長，）副會長沈嗣良（上海特別市體育會理事長，）渡邊信男（上海居留民團長）青木節（上海日本商工會議所會頭，）顧問馮節（宣傳部駐滬辦事處長，）賑崎春茂（陸軍報導部長，）曼立托（伊太利總領事，）林炯庵（上海特別市體育會常務幹事，）岡崎嘉玉太（大使館總部長，）渡正監（工部局總監，）鐵田正一（海軍報道部長，葉堯公（滿總領事，）矢野正記（日總領事，）飛機爾（德總領事，）甘濃益在郎（民會議長，）趙叔雍（上海特別市體育會幹事長，）廣田洋二（大使館情報部長，）競技委員長井上剛（中日文化協會上海分會體育部主任幹事，）參與岩本清（同盟通信社中南支總局長，）石原虎好（大使館官房長，）小澤成一（工部局總務局長，）奧村勝藏（大使館總務課長，）小山濠一（中支那日本人陸上競技協會，）總務委員岩本清（同盟通信社中南支總局長，）林廣吉（市政研究會，）橋本嚴（大使館報道課，）西野護（中支那日本人陸上競技協會，）林炯庵（上海特別市體育會常務幹事，）小川清一（中支那日本人蹴球協會）。又悉，大連隊選手一行三十五人，約於十五日左右可以抵滬，屆時雙方角逐，盛况定卜空前。</p>

<h3>短評　大家動員捐款</h3>
<p>上海各界華北急賑會，業已正式成立，就公布之章程，募款方案，及理事職員等人選，觀測該會全貌與性能：（一）唯一任務爲籌募華北急賑經費；（二）募款方法，除直接勸導捐錢捐物以外，並提倡「娛樂不忘救災」；（三）人選幾已包羅全市各界中堅分子。憑我們直覺的理想，該會工作必能順利開展，獲得良好成績。我們於期待該會諸君子全體動員，同共努力以外，敬再向全滬市民，尤其是有錢有物者，致其誠摯的熱望。</p>
<p>錢之爲物，及其爲用，我們的觀念，是（一）錢爲死物，調度與運用，在於活的人，在於活的用；（二）錢來自社會，應爲社會用，應用於社會；（三）錢之於人，猶如肥料之於植物，不可過少，也不必過多。過少固無以資生，過多則亦無益於人生。甚且如過分的肥料，足以燒死植物，自身反蒙實害。多積死守，獨自爲焚；廣爲積蓄，以貽子孫，孫子恃此，遂生驕縱。凡此皆人爲錢之奴隸，太不值得。所以有錢者，務必用之得當，得所，得時，今賑濟災苦同胞，可謂得當，得所，得時之用錢了。</p>
<p>我們更進而列舉數例，以盼移可節之資，急難助賑，如節省跳舞及不正當娛樂之耗費一也，節省購置舶來高貴品之消費二也，撙節婚喪喜慶舖張浪費五也，節省互餽禮物之糜費六也。即此六項，如能以災黎爲念，手下留神，移動賑款，其數可觀。其效乃宏。</p>
<p>事急矣！時迫矣！願各界同胞羣起盡力，從速完成此「救災如救火」的重大工作。</p>
<h3>經濟界　民族醬的前進形勢</h3>
<p>民族資本這一個問題，常會引人關心。在國府參戰以後，民族資本在質與量兩方面都將有顯著的前進。第一，全國商業統制總會是個民族資本的組織。中國商業關係的資本，向來特別發達，不過以其並無整個國民經濟組織之作用，所以對於中國經濟的整個發展，並無多大貢獻。這是商業資本的本來性格，而組織與指導的缺乏，也是其理由之一。</p>
<p>中國的商業資本，自從商統會的創立，加以最近中儲銀行的力量增强，益以中小工業的勃興，解除敵產後的具有相當規模企業的復活，都可認爲生產活動之曙光。</p>
<p>第二，國府當局如何重視國家資本，陳公博氏及陳君慧氏的言論中，已經數度闡明。由於中國事變以來的各種情勢，當然不能使國家資本十分發展，國府當局深知此情，故所採取之賢明穩的方式，如採辦配給米穀的機構，又如最近發表之建設計劃，均足認作中國國家資本的光輝發展。</p>
<p>在今日世界情勢之下，後起國家要在經濟上謀得發展，非實行統制經濟下不可，但欲求統制經濟的順利運用，則民間資本與國家資本，必須密切合作。</p>
<p>此外，後起國家欲圖前進，非有先進國的援助與指導不可，這是歷史上數見不鮮的前例。中國的民族資本欲圖前進，當然有賴於日本的協助與指導，然後可以談到中國民族資本的健全發展，以期貢獻於中國經濟的復興。（雲鵬：節譯六月二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>滬囤積案與軍配組合事　日大使館發表調查結果</h3>
<p>關於上海囤積事件，因牽涉軍票交換用物資配給組合方面，日駐華大使館當局聞訊後，鑒於該項問題，不但攸關物價問題，並深恐影響對華協力政策，遂極力進行調查，以期澈底明瞭其眞相，結果判明軍配組合，對於此次囤積事件，並無直接關係，不過係謠傳而已。但日駐華大使館當局，今後決將極力晚上囤積事件之發生，同時並將其調查結果，於二日下午三時發表談話，詳加闡明。又我國政府自成立物資調查委員會以來，現正進行第二次之調查，其結果最近即可發表。此次由於中日雙方共同進行遏止囤積事件工作，預期收獲莫大之效果。茲將日駐華大使館所發表談話之要旨錄後：日本帝國大使館聞悉此次上海囤積事件，牽涉軍票交換用物資配給組合後，即進行調查，經調查結果，判明事實內容如下：軍配組合之任務，乃在自華中方面向華南華北交換軍票以及採辦軍需物件，此次之採辦棉布，適在上海市塲棉布價格高漲，採辦困難，遂以人造絲與銀行擔保中之棉布，實行物物交換，此舉並不影響市面，以爲便於採辦關係，遂委託振華公司韓拱北經辦，但韓其遂將棉布（數量一·三九〇箱）在市塲中用暗市買入，致人被誤認軍配組合發生囤積行爲，因遂使軍配組合成爲謠言之對象，此僅爲軍配組合之關係職員行爲有遺憾之處，當對該組織總務部委員會予以處分。此次上海囤積事件之發生，實至堪遺憾，國府現確立戰事態勢，而爲完遂大東亞戰爭，中日兩國人士，當具自重自肅之精神，向前努力，日本方面，決與國府緊密協力，以徹底芟除囤積事件，茲特說明軍配組織調查結果，至希兩國人士，明瞭眞象，協力政府當局之施策。</p>

<h3>紗布搬運由區公署蓋印　市經濟局昨加否認</h3>
<p>昨載工部局物資統制局發給之紗布搬運證，須由滬西區公署蓋印，方可在兩租界區域外通用一節，中央社記者昨特向本市經濟局探詢眞相，據該局負責人談，在本市市區以內關於棉紗棉布之移動，按照實業部最近規定，各廠自用原料，經各該同業公會之證明，應准予移動，至搬出物資流動統制綫以外者，則須經商業統制總會發給搬運許可證，故昨日消息並非事實云。</p>

<p>工部局公會課，對界內公會管理，頗爲嚴格。規定各業公會，均須塡具月報，對一月內之會務動態，一律須據實塡報，以備審核。上月份之月報，當局已通令迅速塡就呈報，限於本月十日前必須繳呈該課審查。</p>

<h3>幫忙</h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>幫忙是一種美德，但若施之不愼，便會流爲助桀爲虐、或貽害被幫忙者的惡行。</p>
<p>怎樣才能避免這不愼行動的發生呢？</p>
<p>第一，對於所幫之事，應先加以鎭密地考察，這事須以於被幫者有所裨益，而又不損害他人，貽害社會，或更能兼利他人，及造福社會爲標準。否則假使對於所幫之事，不辨是非曲直，一味徇於私誼，即貿然從事，則極容易因我一臂之助，使無率之人，或整個社會蒙受到極大的損害，而自己亦因之成爲萬人唾罵的罪人。</p>
<p>第二，須審視被幫忙者是否在必需要我幫忙的時候，因爲同樣的幫忙，『雪中送炭』和『錦上添花』其價値便有天壤之別，因爲前者在於救人危急，而後者　往往卷成了對方依賴的心理，假使沒有你的助力，他儘可以力求自助，如今旣萬事有人幫助，便阻塞了他的進取之心，所以富家子弟的能力往往有遜於貧寒者，其原因便在於此，這樣豈不是愛之適足以害之了嗎？</p>
<p>所以在實施幫忙之前，假使對於上述二項，能夠審愼考慮，那便能使幫者有功，受者獲益了。</p>
<h3>一個少女的悲哀自述</h3>
<p>— 蔡明</p>
<p>不幸得很，當我在七八歲時，左手和右腿，覺得有些麻木，但卻並不在意；到了十二歲，面部浮腫起來，大家斷定是患了麻瘋病。這風聲傳播出去，村中的紳士們向我爸爸提出警吿，要把我活活處死，或者逐出村外，這使爸爸急得寢食俱廢。他們毫不容情地接二連三來催逼着。爸爸答應他們去找醫生、打聽得在離村不遠有個專治麻瘋的醫生，就領着我去診斷、斷定我所患的是混合性麻瘋，非打針不可，但是必須要二百元醫藥費，因爲我爸爸拿不出這樣一筆大款子，也就沒有結果。</p>
<p>常我們含着眼淚囘到家中的時候，情形不好了，只見村人們聲勢洶洶，拿着些刀和棒，要把我處死，爸爸嚇得發抖，叫我快快去逃生。天已黑下來了，我只有盲目似地走了半個鐘頭。昏黑之中，不由得放聲大哭起來。後來想哭也不是辦法。還是去尋找死神罷！茫茫然走到一條河邊、縱身一躍，在此一剎那問，神志完全喪失了！</p>
<p>過了不知多少時候，想不到隱約地有人在旁邊喚我，說可憐的小姑娘，爲什麼要投河？當我漸漸淸醒了時，把實情吿訴他們，他們一聽見我是麻瘋女，立刻改變了態度，懊悔把我救起，趕快驅逐我出來。我拖着一身濕淋淋的衣服，天氣又冷，想不如再去投河罷！這時天已大亮了，村中人都出來工作，一見了我，就圍攏來許多人，商量怎樣把我處死，正在七張八嘴的當兒，忽然有個老年人，出來勸止他們，說他雖然患了麻瘋，究竟沒有犯什麽罪，還不如叫他爸爸設法送到醫院去，只要我們村上不受傳染就夠了。我便像從死裏得生地同到家中，那個老年人又吿訴我爸爸說：在大衾有個麻瘋院，我便因此得進了這個病院，時間過得眞快，不知不覺已過了兩年，我的病體雖然沒有全愈，卻已覺得漸漸地好轉了，囘想到那時的經過，眞彷彿是一海酸辛的大　！（却酬）</p>
<h3>論個性</h3>
<p>— 陳方中</p>
<p>個性是什麼？它是思想和情感二者交流綜合的結晶，它支配着我們整個的人生。雖然由於先天的遺傳性和後天生活習慣所支配，但它畢竟有改造環境和變遷遺傳性的功能。</p>
<p>生活環境和個性二者問是密切連繫着的。合理的生活便能影響合理個性，相同地合理的個性也會影響合理生活。不過要改造生活必先改造個性着手。</p>
<p>優良個性的表現便是生之樂趣，它是恒久性含眞的趣味，其表顯的面目即是無長不怒，是優性的核心，也是人與人問接觸的滑油、我們要獲得它，那末必須栽養正確思想，欲致思想正確便得認淸公理辨白是非，其後自然思慮澄淸胸懷無掛，即能做到無長地步，熱情可掬便得設身處地原恕他人，而後種種怨天尤人不解自消。</p>
<p>具備了合理的思緒，便會產生合理化的行爲。我們即可視察其合節的動作，其實我們有了美的動態，也能感應及正常的思情——眞的個性，它們鄱是相互關繫着的。</p>
<p>掌握住優美的個性便產生了規律的生活，進至於從事社會的改革，因它是進步社會中的靈魂。生之意義即是加促人類進步——善的範疇，我們要獲致它，則必須努力於優良個性的發展。</p>
<h3>日本海軍異聞錄（八）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>白地的太陽旗，據安政二年七月德川　府所公布的命令稱：「　今日起，日本船不再和別國的船隻混淆不淸了。掛上了白地的太陽旗。』當時尙不算是國旗，不過是掛在船隻上的旗幟。</p>
<p>明治三年一月，制定爲國旗。但無論在陸，在海，在商船上，在軍艦上，都縣掛同樣的太陽旗。之後在明治二十一年十月七日，在太陽上添加了十六道光綫，特別專用於軍艦。</p>
<p>船上招展着軍艦旗的，表示是日本帝國海軍艦船的旗輟。並又表示日本帝國海軍的存在。這旗幟的所在地，不容有一絲一毫別的冒犯。是極神聖的。當升降的時候，由定時的當値將校發令，吹奏『君的代表』樂曲，衛兵隊舉槍，一切人員肅立致敬，海外的同胞，遙望帝國軍艦入港的姿勢，見到迎風　揚的軍艦旗，欣喜地，感激地，自然而然傾瀉着熱淚。平時在停泊中，從朝晨至日落，軍艦旗招展於軍艦後部的旗竿，在航行中，則不分畫夜的揭揚着，一日要交戰了，就略有變動。聽到</p>
<p>『準備戰鬥』的號令，後尾的旗竿早就因要發射大砲的緣故而收起把旗移向在後檣附近的斜　上。等戰機成熱了，戰鬥的喇叭在怒吼了，同時，另一　軍艦旗　升於橋頂。這　頂的旗就爲爲戰鬥旗。一見戰鬥旗揭升時，全體乘員的心胸都緊張感動起次。於是情緒。意志都愈加旺盛起來。</p>
<p>一面經過一次事變或戰役，而曾有非常名譽的，値得紀念的戰鬥的旗幟，總是很謹愼保存着，這保存旗稱爲紀念軍艦旗，平時收藏在艦上的箱中，常舉行觀艦式或其他儀式的時候，便揭揚這一面旗。又假使在另一次的事變或戰役中，重又揭揚昔日有名譽的紀念軍艦旗時，那就是表示非常重要的戰鬥。</p>
<p>陸軍的聯隊旗，太陽周邊也有十六道光綫。看似一樣，但有極大的不同。</p>
<p>聯隊旗是聖上陛下御手頒賜的。</p>
<p>這聯隊旗，曾經幾千幾百的戰役，　幾經砲烟彈雨下的洗體、始終不替換的，而軍艦旗則是海軍自已製成的。在一艘軍艦中，備有大小軍艦旗很多。爲要光明正大地使他人知道這是帝國海軍的軍艦，如其破裂了，就很難識別。所以如有破裂等情，就可以拿出來替換。</p>
<p>在此次戰爭中，大家都知道外國有所謂代將旈者，日本沒有。一艘軍艦如其由大佐代理少將的職務者，那時候所揭的旗就是代將旈，這是把將旗（太陽四周有八道光綫）的一端切成了燕尾形。不稱旗而稱旈者，因其縱描的比率與別的旗不同，近於吹流的形狀。（　：譯自朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>奎寗囤積者可以休矣</h3>
<p>— 朱淵</p>
<p>癮疾在初起時，患者因暫無生命大害，而健康之人，等到熱勢一退，即可行動如常。更兼治藥之昂貴，不免因循，久久不治，遂致躭誤。</p>
<p>奎寗爲治癮疾之主要藥品，在戰前每千粒（指雙桃牌二風奎　）只七八元，每粒不到一分，本是極普邇極便宜之藥品，戰事發生從，運輸漸斷，各藥房亦不肯大量發售，而價格漸操諸存貨充足之藥房，由是漸漸上漲，但上海存貨極足，雖十年亦不致用　。</p>
<p>到三十年下半年，每千粒已續漲至八十餘元舊幣，三十一年春，囤戶大量囤積，奎寗途狂漲特漲，一日之價數變，於是西藥行亦乘機林立，營業似交易所然，於是有貨者狂抬，無貨者代掮，外行及已囤別貨者皆改囤奎寗：現在之價已數百倍，此種上漲實非貨物缺乏，實由囤戶囤貴，現在之奎寗，已非貧窮者所能染指，而已成囤戶之皮球，踢進踢出，獲致鉅利，貧苦者不幸患瘧疾，無力購藥治療。瘧疾因循不治，致瘧原蟲在血液中被壞多量亦血球之結果，呈極嚴重之貧血現象，皮膚蒼白色，並常有頭痛，目眩，噁心等。</p>
<p>我是一家藥房的學徒，見來購奎寗之主顧，大半貧窮人，患病大都已患半年至二年者，而其中經治瘉後復發者尤甚，大槪窮人平日營養不良，抵抗力缺乏，故尤難痊瘉，來購者時因經濟關係，只購一二粒同去，如勸他們多買幾顆，頻頻服用，以防復發。但以價格高昻，均皺眉苦笑而去；如是形成患者無藥吃而成貧血者，囤戶之囤積無異吸血鬼之吸血。</p>
<p>治療用奎寗，一次用足量（一克）於發作前三四小時服之，可制止發作，後於不發日每日服一克分三次服，連服數日，比較容易制止復發，有友人患瘧綿延不絕者已六七年，後因人介紹，注射新六〇六二針後治瘉（前一針爲〇·四五後爲〇·六）如久瘧不瘉者。不妨請醫注射之。</p>
<p>近日張金海案之慘酷，激起社會之共鳴，可見人類本有互助及博愛之天性，今觀此大量之吸血鬼，日日在吸取血液，雖然無形，共害非小，特籲請注意而作有效之措施。</p>
<h3>自動和被動</h3>
<p>— 忍義</p>
<p>自動是出自乎本心，明瞭了事態的眞象，知道了本身須要去做的重要，這樣的做法就稱爲自動。被動是田別人指使，非出自乎本心，　　明瞭事物之重要。根本就談不到眞心和誠意，只是適應指使者的命令而已。現在社會裏不知有多少人在被動着，作些他們不情願做的工作，因爲這些工作對於他們不生興趣，所以亦就是馬虎了事，不務實際，所以很難上進。犯這種病的尤其是富家子弟們的靑年學生爲最多。付了學費到學校裏來求學這是父母們吩咐的事，所讀的書好像亦是給父母們讀的一般，他們不明白讀書的重要簡直就不生興趣，每天的功課亦是被逼迫而讀的。有者甚至於僅在學校裘掛了個名而總是廬山不見眞面目的，借此讀書時間去間盪，逍遙，胡調。</p>
<p>由此我們知道了被動的弊病在無謂的消耗物力和時間，所以做事一定要使執事者明白事物之眞象，知道其重要性，並指明應做之途徑，使其處於自動的地位，眞心誠意的努力前逸，這樣才有希望才有成功，窮苦的學生們多處於此種地位，他們對於讀書發生了興趣，並明瞭了讀書的重要，所以會有始有終沒有一時一刻的怠惰。你看古今名人那個不是由自動地位而做出來的呢？我們需要自動的發展不需要被動的盲從。</p>
<h3>萍踪小語</h3>
<p>— 謙父</p>
<p>人情是不能不有的，但是人情是用來成全道義的，不是用來摧毀道義的。所以，袒護惡劣的同僚。放縱不肯的子弟，容忍犯罪的成友，都是違背道義的，也是違背人情的。</p>
<p>「自私」是一切罪惡的淵藪，「詐偽」是掩蔽罪惡的無上伎倆，所以「自私」與「詐僞」是罪惡的左右手。</p>
<p>人無爪牙而能征服猛獸，甚至能教猛獸演戲，這不是恃力，乃是恃智。所以人應付日常的事物，也當多用智，少用力。若是只憑一時之盛氣，是少有不失敗的。</p>
<p>家人相生相尅之說，我是不相信相命老的預定的。但我却借善惡的對立。一家之中，有善有惡，互相爭鬥，善勝則惡改，如是，則一家以善和，惡勝則善變，如是即一家以惡行，家庭最苦之境况，就是善惡相持不下的時期！（却酬）</p>
<h3>管閒事</h3>
<p>— 可時</p>
<p>在一向「各人自掃門前雪，其管他家瓦上霜。」的傳統作風下，很少有人想到管閒事的，就是有，也不過是說東道西的背後批評他人的私生活而已。</p>
<p>平時在路上，偶而發生了一件事，便有不少人作「壁上觀」，而所拋的態度，又是「他人之事，鄙人槪不負責。」隨便這件事鬧得如何，只不過暫時做一下旁觀者。一旦有人爲了正氣而打抱不平，「壁上觀」者還會說：「算了吧！人家的事，管他呢，少管閒事吧！」好像這種事不僅得管，又好像不該管。</p>
<p>俗語說：「狗捉老鼠——多管閒事。」捉老鼠，本是貓的事，狗捉老鼠豈不是超越本份，多管閒事嗎？然而，假使在沒有貓的時候，狗代爲捉老鼠，那麼人家會如何的高光呢，換句話說，在發生困難時，有人幫助排解，那時是如何的感激呢。</p>
<p>那麼，在他人發生危難時，爲什麼要勸人少管閒事，這是不是算是盡了人類互助的本能，還是人類應盡的義務呢？</p>

<h3>Expanding Anti-Drug Efforts</h3>
<p>The Opium War 103 years ago (1840) marked the beginning of modern Chinese history, and the beginning of China's history of colonization. More precisely, it was also the beginning of the invasion of East Asian countries and East Asian peoples by Britain and the United States. The beginning of resistance to foreign invasion. This year, 101 years later, we are at the decisive moment of the Greater East Asia War, we are ending the century-old history of humiliation of the East Asian people, and we are building a new China and a new East Asia on the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation. During this period, we must eliminate the harm left in China and East Asia by opium and "spiritual opium," because only by greatly expanding this anti-drug movement can we guarantee the independence, freedom, and sound development of China and East Asia.</p>
<p>The exact year when opium was first imported into China is difficult to determine, but it was probably initially used as a stimulant or for other medicinal purposes, and its harm was not yet very obvious. However, in the early 19th century, after Britain occupied India and then extended its aggressive claws to Burma, Tibet, Yunnan, and even mainland China, opium suddenly became the most serious social and even political problem in China and even East Asia. It forced the cultivation of opium in India, with China as its main sales market, not only reaping unexpected profits but also anesthetizing the Chinese people, creating conditions conducive to aggression. Zhu Gui, a cabinet scholar and vice minister of the Ministry of Rites at the time, pointed out in a memorial: "Opium corrupts the people, weakens the people, and has a myriad of harms without a single benefit. The red-bearded British barbarians import it into China, just as the Dutch conquered Java by means. Therefore, China will also fall into this dangerous position." Zhu also lamented in the memorial: "Now the poison of opium has caused the army to sink into the abyss of corruption and depravity, and officials and Confucian scholars are also infected with this poison, and the moral standards of the general people have declined from this point on." Later, Lin Zexu's strict ban can be said to be the first resistance of the Chinese nation against Western aggression. Although the Opium War failed due to the obvious predictions of the Qing court and the late integrity of the strategic plan, it had already aroused the people's vigilance against the harm of opium and the people's determination to resist British aggression. Under the atrocities of the British soldiers, it had aroused the heroic uprisings of the people in Guangzhou, Foshan, Sanyuanli, and other places to "pacify England," giving the British army a serious blow.</p>
<p>The disastrous defeat of the Opium War and the humiliating result of the Treaty of Nanjing marked the beginning of a century of dark and painful humiliation for the Chinese nation. It was not until December 8th of the year before last, when Japan launched the Greater East Asia War and drove out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in the East Asian region, that the shackles imposed on the Chinese people since the Opium War were finally shattered, and the tragic poison suffered by the Chinese nation was finally eliminated. However, judging from the current facts, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, and they are still indulging in the sweet dream of restoring their special privileges in China since the Opium War. At the same time, judging from the actual situation in our country, since the Opium War, opium and its related poisons have spread far and wide and penetrated deep into the people. Although the authorities have repeatedly made efforts to persuade and ban them, the remaining poison has not been completely eliminated. To this day, there are still many poppy fields in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, and opium taxes are even used to supplement government expenses. Even in the peaceful areas, it cannot be said that there is absolutely no such phenomenon. This is only the tangible harm of opium and other drugs. As for the toxins that have been deeply ingrained in the spirit along with opium, such as laziness, waste, foolishness, depression, selfishness, and lack of public morality and patriotism, etc., their corrosive and corrupting effects on the country and society are actually no less than opium, and even more so. If these tangible and intangible poisons of opium are not completely eliminated sooner rather than later, then even if there is no trace of British and American troops in the Pacific, we ourselves will be helpless.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a tangible poison or an intangible toxin, absolute and thorough elimination is required. Based on a century of experience, it is deeply believed that the following points must be noted: First, the anti-drug movement cannot be biased towards top-down government decrees and punishments, nor can it be biased towards powerless and unauthoritative civil life, but must be government with strict laws and severe punishments, and social leaders working together to supervise, in order to achieve practical results. The government leader's ability to carry out orders is especially important. Second, in addition to the above-mentioned symptomatic treatment methods, we must also jointly seek fundamental methods to eliminate opium and intangible toxins. This means, on the one hand, raising the cultural level of the people so that every citizen can consciously understand the harm of opium, understand the toxins of spiritual opium, and understand how to avoid being poisoned by it, and then jointly seek to completely eliminate this poison. On the other hand, we must promote the New Citizen Movement, using scientific undertakings, sports activities, and legitimate entertainment, etc., so that opium and other poisons have no chance of temptation, and arouse a sense of disgust among all people. We should also advocate science, promote medicine, especially with the cooperation of government authorities and powerful social figures, to save the poor compatriots who have already fallen into the black sea, and severely ban all false quit-smoking drugs and disguised quit-smoking places.</p>
<p>Anti-drug efforts are a social movement, but also a political and cultural movement. Its success or failure is closely related to the future of the country and the nation, and can also be said to be closely related to the future of the East Asian people. We must remind the people of the country here that if we do not immediately make up our minds to completely eliminate the tangible and intangible poisons of opium, then even if we defeat the British and American troops, we cannot guarantee the revival of China and the stability of East Asia.</p>
<p>Historical Excerpts</p>
<h3>Former Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Yipeng's Report on the Situation of Burning Opium and Proposed Measures to Prohibit Opium</h3>
<p>(Published in Government Gazette No. 1106 on March 4th, Republic of China Year 8)</p>
<p>This is to report on the completion of the opium burning, and to present in detail the situation and future measures to prohibit opium, requesting your consideration: On December 3rd, Republic of China Year 7, the President ordered that the opium previously purchased by the government was exclusively sold for medicinal purposes. This was originally intended to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants. Although careful investigation and strict restrictions were added, it left a root, and it was feared that it would easily lead to abuses and affect the future of opium prohibition. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance were ordered to investigate the exact amount of opium currently in stock. Except for those already sold, the rest should be recovered under the supervision of officials dispatched by the ministries, collected at the Customs, and destroyed completely on a regular basis. A special commissioner should be appointed to jointly supervise with local officials and Customs Commissioners to show caution. This is the order. Upon receiving this, on December 19th, the State Council issued a letter stating: The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance reported on the case of requesting the dispatch of a special commissioner to supervise the burning of opium in stock. Zhang Yipeng was appointed to supervise. This is the order. Upon receiving this, a corresponding letter was sent for investigation. Upon receiving this, Yipeng immediately packed his bags and took his staff, including Jiang Zhongjue, Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, to Shanghai. He arrived in port on December 23rd and immediately met with Shao Fuying, Commissioner of the Ministry of Interior, Wang Zhenjia, Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, Feng Guoxun, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Chen Yifan, negotiator, Weihoulan, Inspector General of Customs, and others to discuss and examine the various methods of burning and destroying opium, in order, to properly handle the matter, in order to live up to Your Majesty's intention to eliminate opium poisoning. The details have been reported by telegram and in person in Beijing. However, the value of the opium destroyed this time is estimated at more than 30 million yuan, and the government's bonds issued to foreign drug firms are also worth more than 13 million yuan. In terms of weight, there are more than 1,013 boxes of large opium and 194 boxes of small opium. The country's move to sacrifice so much money and set it on fire is because opium is the most harmful to China. Not only is Your Majesty resolute and meticulous in wanting to eliminate the national disease, but also those who are outside the situation express their deep sympathy and enthusiastic support. However, at the beginning of Yipeng's arrival in Shanghai, public opinion was in turmoil, spreading rumors, saying that there was theft and leakage, or that fake was used to replace real, and various forms of corruption were witnessed, almost making anyone involved in handling this case subject to destruction. They also promoted the theory of giving opium as a gift in order to undermine the agreement to burn opium. Fortunately, the government adhered to its firmness and was able to implement its proposition, and Yipeng, having decided to investigate and deal with those who purchased opium in stock, and having personally engaged in negotiations, dared to be confident that he would not slacken his heart in the face of difficulties and rumors. He thought that although burning was easy, if there were any omissions in the handling, various abuses would inevitably arise. If he did not conduct a detailed investigation before burning, it would not be enough to quell doubts and stop slander. Therefore, he decided that the first step was investigation and the second step was burning. The investigation procedure was the most cumbersome. To summarize the main points, the investigation method must be precise, and the observation must be universal. Those who are good at appraisal use surgery and eyesight to observe in detail, and the authenticity is already obvious. Still, fearing that there is something not exhaustive, it is necessary to rely on chemical inspection. It is necessary to hire specialized talents to identify in detail. Therefore, the British Consul Faleisi recommended the chemist Mrs. Baobo to be in charge of the chemical inspection, and invited the famous Chinese chemists Que Zhaohong and Que Zhaokun, etc. Yipeng secretly invited two Chinese merchants who were experienced in the opium trade to work together to determine the quality, and ordered them to report on the chemical inspection at any time. This is what is meant by the investigation method must be precise. There are many groups in Shanghai, and the most important ones are the Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Education Association, the North-South Chamber of Commerce, the Youth Association, and the National Joint Opium Prohibition Association. All of these were designated by the State Council as joint supervision agencies. In addition, more than 20 groups, such as the Construction Association, also agreed to nominate representatives to supervise in rotation. In addition, administrative agencies and famous Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai were all invited to the venue. There are signature books and certificates to prove this. This is what is meant by observation must be universal. Also, because the capacity of the old and new kilns in Pudong was too small and it took a long time, it was agreed with the Tax Commissioner to build two more kilns to shorten the time and prevent abuses. Each kiln can burn 200 boxes a day, and 40 stokers are hired to turn the opium over from time to time. Each kiln is turned over more than 30 times to ensure that the remaining embers become coke and no longer have the effect of smoke ash. During the waiting period for the kiln to be built, Yipeng contacted consuls from various countries and figures from all walks of life every day, and conducted practical discussions. Whenever there was a celebration, he spared no effort to give speeches, advocating the country's great intention to burn opium and prohibit opium. Yipeng also personally drafted 13 articles of rules for supervising the burning of opium and submitted them for implementation, and prepared various entry badges to ensure that people attending the venue were in order. This is the preparatory situation before the inspection and burning. When all the arrangements were ready, the inspection began on January 8th, Year 8. There were a total of two batches of opium in Shanghai, one stored in the Yihe New Warehouse and the other stored in the Sassoon Warehouse. The inspection started from Yihe. On that day, the consuls of the United States, France, and Sweden, as well as famous Chinese and foreign people and representatives of various agencies, all attended the venue. The order inside the venue was orderly. A total of 42 boxes of large opium and 2 boxes of small opium were inspected in Yihe. Each box was split open, and Yipeng personally inspected it and handed it to the observers to watch in turn. The inspected opium was still packed in the original box, and lead wires were threaded around it, wrapped in sacks, and a tin block was branded at the total seam. Yipeng and the Tax Commissioner jointly stamped the seal, and the handling was very cautious. Each box was dissected and inspected from five to more than ten times. Those with doubts were chemically inspected by Baobo on the spot, and everyone witnessed it. On the 9th, 80 boxes of opium were inspected, on the 10th, 64 boxes were inspected, on the 11th, 100 boxes were inspected, on the 12th, 112 boxes were inspected, on the 13th, 53 boxes were inspected, on the 14th, 95 boxes were inspected, and on the 15th, 94 boxes were inspected. In total, the inspection of the opium stored in Yihe was completed. Although there were seven large opium that were underweight, the Tax Commissioner publicly weighed and dissected each box, and there were no abuses. All of this was reported by telegram. Fearing that the date would be too long if all the opium in both warehouses was inspected before being burned, and that the equipment might not be adequate, the opium that had been inspected was transported to the Pudong kiln for burning from the 17th. At 8:00 a.m. on the same day, Deputy Tax Commissioner Kliya took care of the opium at the Yihe Warehouse, and 100 boxes of large opium were transported by barge, towed by a small wheel across the Pu River. The Public Works Bureau sent police and detectives to secretly protect it along the way. There were Customs water patrol teams in Pudong, and police patrol teams, soldiers from the Defense Commissioner, judicial police from the local prosecutor's office, and Pudong police patrolled each other at the burning site. When the opium arrived, Yipeng and the Tax Commissioner inspected the lead branding and tin seals box by box, and split open the boxes. Yipeng, together with the Tax Commissioner, put the opium into the kiln for burning. On the 18th, 120 boxes of large opium were burned, on the 19th, 200 boxes of large and small opium were burned, and on the 20th, 222 boxes of large and small opium were burned. In total, 642 boxes of opium stored in Yihe were burned to ashes. Then the inspection of the opium stored in Sassoon was started. Because the Sassoon warehouse was small and it was difficult for many people to inspect and supervise, the Tax Commissioner strongly requested that it be moved to the Yihe warehouse for handling. Because the opium stored in Sassoon was opium waiting to be inspected, there was no problem in moving it first. A bright telegram was sent to report it for approval. It was then transported to the Yihe warehouse. On the morning of the 21st, 70 boxes of large opium were dissected and inspected, and in the afternoon, 41 boxes of large opium were dissected and inspected. The dissection and inspection procedures were still handled according to the previous decision. First, the boxes were opened and poured into wooden buckets, and examined by surgical inspection. If there was any doubt, they were dissected and inspected for the public to watch. At that time, there were guests at the venue who requested that the opium poured out of the boxes be dissected by anyone. They were allowed to dissect several boxes, and there were no abuses. On the 22nd, 142 boxes were inspected, on the 23rd, 141 boxes were inspected, and on the 24th, 140 boxes were inspected. The first three days were 565 boxes. The first time, a total of 1,013 boxes of large opium were inspected, containing 44, and 194 boxes of small opium, containing a total of 19,370 jin and 12 taels. There were also coal boxes. The large opium all matched the book report, and the small opium exceeded 246 jin and 12 taels. There were no abuses. The continued inspection of opium was transported to the Pudong kiln for burning on the 25th. It took three days to burn it completely by the 27th. The remaining ashes were carefully chemically inspected by Customs chemists Robertsson, Chinese chemists Que Zhaohong and Que Zhaokun, and technician Shao Zhongding for days. It was verified that this ash had lost its effectiveness after being burned by intense fire and had become waste. For the sake of caution, it was ordered that the remaining ashes from the two burnings be removed from the kiln, soaked in brine, loaded into cattail bags, and thrown into the sea. This is the actual implementation of the two inspections and burnings. During this opium burning, many gentry and scholars from various countries were able to brave the snow and cold to attend every day, and they all praised and congratulated each other. Some even collected wood chips and lead sheets as souvenirs. Reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers went to the venue every day and recorded it with enthusiasm. There were also photographers who printed the daily inspection and burning events into active films in order to spread them to various countries. The Director General of Customs, Mr. Weihoulan, was especially diligent from beginning to end. All those who held important positions, from officials to coolies, were trained in advance and were mostly transferred from Tianjin, Hankou, and Wuhu Customs, so they had no relationship with the Shanghai natives. They served from morning to night every day, even on Sundays. This is because our Great President is determined to eliminate opium harm, and his sincerity is believed. He has shown his determination to prohibit opium, which is an unprecedented event, so he can be consistent both at home and abroad and achieve success. The country does not hesitate to spend so much national treasury to buy up opium and burn it for the sake of eliminating opium harm for the people. It has already eliminated the hoarding for a while and alarmed the onlookers from all sides. If we do not plan for future measures to prevent future events, I am afraid that after the event has passed, the hidden roots will still lurk. Therefore, we have discussed two measures: One is a positive measure, please revise the Opium Single Line Law to punish opium offenders. Article 10 of Chapter 21 of the Provisional New Criminal Law on Opium Smoking stipulates that the penalties for crimes such as manufacturing, trafficking, and smoking opium are too light, which is not in line with the way of using punishment in chaos. The maximum sentence for manufacturers and traffickers is only the third degree, while the minimum sentence for those who open pavilions for people to smoke and those who smoke opium is only detention. The legislation is too lenient, and people are prone to negligence. We must strictly set special articles to increase the penalties to remedy its abuses. It is proposed to follow the Law on Punishing Bandits and specifically set a Law on Punishing Opium Smoking, so that the people will be afraid of severe punishment and the harm of opium will no longer spread. One is a passive measure, please order the Ministry of Interior to instruct the provinces to establish more good hospitals. It is difficult to raise funds to establish more hospitals, but if smokers can find an effective place to quit, even if the funds are huge, it will not be difficult to raise them, because non-smokers are very willing to help smokers quit and will be happy to support them. Smokers hate the depth of the poison and will eventually be willing to contribute to achieve it. Furthermore, even those who do not smoke cannot guarantee that their children and grandchildren will not smoke, and those who smoke do not want their children and grandchildren to smoke again. If there are good methods and trustworthy hospitals, I think that no matter who has smoked or not, they will be able to do their best to help. The above two articles are only the views of my humble opinion, and I present them to Your Majesty for consideration and selection. In addition to the fact that the chemist Baobo has a chemical inspection certificate, Que Zhaokun's explanation of opium analysis and eight original quality glass tubes for chemical inspection, the technician Shao Shiming's report, the Shanghai Association of Associations' supervision report, and the signature book are attached to the case. All the reasons for the completion of this opium burning, the situation and the discussion of the reasons for prohibiting opium, should be presented, begging the President to review and instruct to follow. Presented on February 18th, Year 8. The instructions have been received.</p>

<h3>State Funeral of the Late Marshal Yamamoto Held in Tokyo on the Fifth Day with Grand Ceremony Venue Determined to Be Hibiya Park in Tokyo Army and Navy Honor Guard Commanders Appointed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The state funeral ceremony for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan is scheduled to be held at Hibiya Park here on the 5th of this month. The commander-in-chief of the army and navy honor guards has been decided to be General Doihara Kenji, commander of the Eastern Army, and the chief of staff is Major General Tatsumi Eiichi, chief of staff of the Eastern Army. Colonel Takayama Shigeji has been appointed as the commander of the navy honor guard and the appointment order has been issued today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The state funeral ceremony for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan will be held solemnly on June 5th amidst national mourning. Since Duke Iwakura Tomomi was first granted a state funeral with meritorious qualifications in Meiji 16 (1883), up to now, there have been two courtiers, three feudal lords, three politicians, and three soldiers who have been granted the honor of state funeral among the imperial family and good vassals. Marshal Yamamoto is the first to die in the front line and be granted a state funeral. In Japan, the common explanation of "state funeral" is "using national funds for funeral expenses," but its true spirit is a funeral ceremony that expresses heartfelt condolences from the whole country, that is, a state funeral. Also, the Japanese generally recognize that the state funeral ceremony is formulated by vassals, but in fact it is based on the imperial funeral ceremony that has been prescribed. As for the state funeral of vassals, it is a special case. The Japanese state funeral system did not have a certain rule at the beginning. It was not until the enactment of the State Funeral Order in Taisho 15 (1926) that its principles were clearly stated, which also stipulated that it be divided into two types: natural state funeral and specially bestowed state funeral. Natural state funeral refers to the provisions of Article 1 of the Japanese State Funeral Order, "Grand Funeral Ceremony," and Article 2, "Funeral Ceremony for those specially designated among the imperial family." Therefore, even if it is a member of the imperial family, a state funeral may not necessarily be held. As for the state funeral bestowed by special decree, it is based on Article 3 of the State Funeral Order, "Those who have made great contributions to the country may be granted a state funeral by special decree at the time of their death. This special decree will be issued by imperial edict and then announced by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet." The so-called "those who have made great contributions to the country" must be pillars of the country, have made great achievements, and be unanimously admired by the people of the whole country. Therefore, when a state funeral is held, it can actually be regarded as being awarded the same honor as "titles, medals and other honors" in Article 15 of the Constitution. The content of this honor is, first, using national funds for funeral expenses, and second, designating state officials to handle funeral affairs. Among them, the expense item is submitted to the Diet as an additional budget during the Diet session, and is allocated from the second reserve fund item during the Diet recess and requires the next Diet to approve it. Also, when a state funeral is decided, the government appoints the chairman and vice-chairman of the funeral ceremony, as well as the funeral committee members and staff. Among them, the position of chairman is held by a senior official who has a close relationship with the deceased, and the position of vice-chairman is usually held by the Chief Cabinet Secretary. The committee members are appointed by the Cabinet and the Imperial Household Ministry and other officials who have a relationship with the deceased. Because the state funeral is a state ceremony, the procedure for performing the state funeral ceremony in the Shinto style is stipulated as follows: On the day, the Emperor's envoy will first pay homage, followed by the Empress and the Empress Dowager and the envoys of the various princes to pay their respects, and then the bereaved family will present the coins for the gods. After that, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Japan will pay homage on behalf of their countries, and the senior officials will present the coins for the gods. As for the general public, they will present them after the ceremony is completed. Also, according to Article 4 of the Japanese State Funeral Order, on the day of the state funeral, the Emperor will abolish the court, and the whole country will stop entertainment. Therefore, the state funeral ceremony is an unusually grand special treatment. It is an supreme honor for Japanese vassals to be granted a state funeral. The state funeral of the late Marshal Yamamoto this time is the third person after Marshal Togo and Prince Saionji after the promulgation of the imperial edict of the State Funeral Order in Japan.</p>
<h3>On the Day of Marshal Yamamoto's State Funeral The Capital Lowered Its Flag to Show Mourning</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - In order to express mourning for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan, the Chinese side has decided that on the day of Marshal Yamamoto's state funeral, all agencies, schools, companies, etc. will lower their flags to show mourning, and will uniformly stop entertainment at 10:50 a.m. on the 5th. Also, Wang, the head of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, is also scheduled to deliver a radio speech with Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, Manchu Prime Minister Zhang, and Thai Prime Minister Phibun to praise Marshal Yamamoto's great achievements and clarify the determination to win the Greater East Asia War in order to urge our country's people to rise up. In addition, the Japanese residents in Nanjing are also scheduled to stop all entertainment on the 5th, and each household will hang the national flag to show mourning. When Prime Minister Tojo pays tribute at 10:40 a.m., they will gather at the First National School to hold a remote worship ceremony to silently pray for the immortal fame of Marshal Yamamoto.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd - Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nanjing Buddhist Association will hold a memorial service at the Nanjing Heroes' Shrine at 8:00 p.m. on the 4th to commemorate the achievements of the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan during his lifetime.

<h3>Mr. Ren Hai's Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) Regarding the heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto and Commander Yamazaki's troops, Mr. Ren Hai recently made the following remarks: We are filled with admiration for the valiant death of Marshal Yamamoto and the heroic sacrifice of Yamazaki's troops on Attu Island. Marshal Yamamoto and Colonel Yamazaki fully demonstrated the noble spirit of our friendly nation, which we usually hear as the Yamato spirit and Bushido. However, our Chinese nation also has no shortage of such great and heroic precedents in ancient times. The generosity of the five hundred warriors of Tian Heng during the Chu-Han contention, the righteousness of Lu Zhonglian in refusing to be emperor of Qin, and the oath of Ning Dao to die by drowning in the sea are all similar to today's Yamazaki troops. It can also be seen that the ancestors of our East Asian nations all possessed this great spirit. All our comrades should learn from and admire this spirit in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Director of the Pacification Affairs Bureau, Wang Manyun's Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) Since the establishment of the Pacification Committee, Mr. Wang Manyun has honorably served as its Deputy Secretary-General. Now, assuming the post of Director of the Pacification Affairs Bureau, Central News Agency reporters visited him yesterday. He briefly stated the following: The National Government specially established the Pacification Committee in May of the year before last, and pacification began in July. This year in May, it marks the second anniversary. During these two years, the pacification work began in the first phase in Jiangsu Province, starting from Taicang, Changshu, Wuxian, and Kunshan counties, gradually expanding along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line to the southeastern area of Taihu Lake. Now Shanghai, Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, eastern Zhejiang, and Anhui are successively being carried out, while Hubei and Guangdong are also in preparation. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War and our country's participation, the pacification work has not only become one of the important tasks of the National Government, but also one of the tasks to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War and stabilize the rear order. Currently, the pacification area is gradually expanding, and affairs are becoming increasingly complex. The Supreme National Defense Council decided to end the Pacification Committee and transfer all pacification affairs to the Executive Yuan for unified leadership in order to achieve comprehensive consideration. For this reason, the Executive Yuan specially established the Pacification Affairs Bureau. However, this bureau is different in nature from the past Pacification Committee. The past Pacification Committee was an executive agency, while the current Pacification Affairs Bureau is a planning and review agency. I am deeply concerned about my inadequacy as Director, and can only rely on the instructions of the Supreme Leader to do my best and strive to contribute.</p>

<h3>Navy Soul (8) The True Meaning of Navy Soul</h3>
<p>— Tsuguharu Foujita</p>
<p>On the evening of October 26th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, when the elite forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy captured the Three Towns of Wuhan, I was dispatched to Hankou by the Navy. The rain and clouds obscuring Hankou and Wuchang were reflected by the countless flames rising in the city, it was truly a desolate dusk. Commander 〇〇 of the flagship 〇〇 warmly welcomed us. He even allowed us to participate in the celebratory evening banquet. The captain first allowed me to bathe. It was a deeply grateful night, and I fell asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was surprised when I woke up. My pants had been neatly folded and ironed by the sailors, and my handkerchief was washed snow-white, folded into a square, and placed next to my pillow. Rice was packed in a two-layer box, ready for landing in Hankou.</p>
<p>Even in such intense combat, the daily life of naval soldiers remained unchanged, and their meticulousness was orderly in every aspect. Simple bravery and skill in battle are not the only elements of the navy soul. I savored this meaning in my heart and was filled with gratitude. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results of the Japanese Army in Central China</h3>

<p>Hankou, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) When the Japanese army in Central China launched the summer offensive, the Japanese army's waterborne unit drove more than 50 American and British ships detained in the Yichang area down the Yangtze River to participate in the battle. At that time, the Chongqing (Sixth War Zone) Jiangfang Army stubbornly resisted by guarding the steep mountains around Yichang, but was defeated step by step by the Japanese army, so the waterborne unit finally completely achieved its purpose of sailing downstream. After the Japanese naval units launched the waterway operation between Yuezhou and Shashi, the Japanese army's waterborne units also began to engage in a downstream operation of approximately 130 kilometers in the turbulent waves of the Yangtze River on a certain day last month, and finally arrived safely at a certain place in the afternoon of a certain day. The Japanese army in Central China has established a great battle achievement of seizing more than 50 ships with tens of thousands of tons, which can not only strengthen the future transportation force, but also have a huge impact in various aspects. More than 50 ships are undamaged and can be used, and their use value is also extremely high.

<h3>Ministry of Justice Sends Personnel to Xiamen to Take Over the Higher and Local Courts</h3>

<h3>The Dissolution of the Third International; The CCP's Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) The news of the dissolution of the Third International has greatly shocked the CCP. There are divergent opinions within the party regarding the path to be followed in the future, and no consensus has been reached. It is reported that when the CCP cadres convened an emergency meeting on May 26th, the entire group unanimously resolved to support the measures taken by the Soviet Union. A meeting of secretaries was convened to ratify the above-mentioned resolutions. It is reported that the content of the resolutions is approximately the following four points: (1) The CCP fully supports the Soviet Union's measures this time and releases all obligations under the regulations and resolutions of the Third International. (2) The historical mission of the Third International has been completed. The CCP has been working hard since 1924, but the current international situation is complex, and it is impossible to achieve the labor movement with the existing organization. Therefore, the goal in the future should be to form an anti-fascist front, mobilize a wide range of the public, and strive for final victory. (3) Due to the dissolution of the Third International, the CCP will further strengthen its connection with the masses to enhance its strength. After the dissolution of the Third International became a fact, public opinion has focused on the change in the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP. Judging from the past situation of mutual conflict between Chongqing and the CCP, it is determined that the content of the CCP's resolution, in addition to taking the opportunity to make further plans to suppress Chongqing, has no other meaning. Therefore, we are even more convinced that the future of the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP will face more and more hidden reefs, and this will be the beginning.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Announces Impressions of Inspecting Manchuria</h3>

He has now returned to Qingdao. He announced the impressions gained from this trip as follows: I was truly surprised by the rapid progress of construction in the past three years during this visit to Manchuria. Although my inspection of Fengtian, Lushun, and Xinjing lasted less than a week, I felt deeply about the prosperity of the Fengtian industrial zone and the great urban construction of Xinjing, comparing the past with the present. In Lushun, I visited the coal liquefaction situation, and the excellent results were beyond my knowledge. Its future development is especially worth looking forward to. The situation of security, food, and prices in Manchuria are all very good. In particular, the smooth operation of the price policy and material allocation is something we can learn a lot from. The general public also feels no inconvenience about this. Seeing the situation, there is no question that Manchuria will fulfill its mission as a Greater East Asia industrial base, which is extremely important. I also had a sincere conversation with key figures in the Manchurian government on this point, hoping to provide assistance as much as possible. This year's rainfall in North China is favorable, and a good harvest can be celebrated. It is said that Manchuria will also celebrate a good year.</p>

<h3>Minister Yamakoshi Michiyuki Discusses the Industrial Situation in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a phone call from Fukuoka, Mr. Yamakoshi Michiyuki, the Minister of Industry of the Philippine Military Administration Department, recently returned to Japan to discuss important matters. He arrived in Fukuoka by plane from Manila on the 1st. He stated that the Philippines' industry focuses on agriculture. Since the occupation of Corregidor Island in May last year, the Philippines has launched a food production increase movement to establish a self-sufficient food system. Luzon Island, which has always been known as the granary of the Philippines, has achieved good results in rice harvesting this year, exceeding expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the Philippines' self-sufficient food system can be established this year. In addition, for cotton, a considerable amount has been harvested last year under the guidance of the Military Administration Department, and it has been decided to implement large-scale planting this year. Furthermore, the production of sugar, etc., is also progressing smoothly. Sugar can be used not only for consumption but also as raw material, so efforts are being made to increase the production of this item. Furthermore, the general public has also launched a self-sufficient food movement. This shows that they have understood our country's true intentions and are voluntarily dedicating themselves to cooperation. Therefore, it can be seen that it is not difficult to solve the food problem in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Axis Reporter Discusses the Situation in India and Burma</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) At the beginning of this year, the British and American sides repeatedly shouted to retake Burma, but the actual developments today are the opposite of what they dreamed of. The enemy forces on the Burmese-Indian border have repeatedly been defeated, and the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable. Regarding this matter, the German newspaper Deutsche Zeitung published a commentary on the 1st, stating that the crisis in India is increasing day by day. As a result, the United States' assistance to India must also gradually increase. To this day, Japan has the potential to replace Britain. Recently, British Indian Army Commander Wavell and his subordinates stated that they would completely drive the Japanese army out of Burma. However, according to a report by a special correspondent of the Jiji Shimpo, the facts are completely opposite. In the past five months, the British army's war on the Indian-Burmese border can be said to have been defeated in every battle. Moreover, the Japanese air force's fierce bombing of Chittagong and other military key points has caused significant damage, and the Japanese army's forest tactics are particularly clever, and the anti-Axis forces have no countermeasures to confront them. A reporter from the Spanish weekly magazine, who was recently hosted by the British and American sides and experienced the interior of India, also reported that the Indian people have gradually understood Japan's true intentions and strength. They now believe that Japan is the only friendly neighbor cooperating with India's independence. Therefore, pro-Japanese sentiment in India is becoming increasingly strong. Speaking of the current situation in India, its military is under heavy pressure from the Japanese army, politically, the people have gradually awakened and understand the true meaning of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and economically, the forces of Britain and the United States are mutually encroaching.</p>

<h3>Talk by German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Berlin dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun here, the duties of Grand Admiral Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, are extremely important. In addition to being equivalent to the Chief of the Naval General Staff and the Minister of the Navy in Japan, he is also directly responsible for commanding the German submarine fleet in combat, making him the foremost figure in the German naval world. A reporter visited him on the 21st, and the Grand Admiral took time out of his busy schedule to meet with him. This was the first time the Grand Admiral had met with a reporter since taking office as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and he made the following remarks: The entire German Navy admires and respects the heroic sacrifice of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander of the Combined Fleet. On this year's Japanese Navy Day, the great overall war achievements of the Japanese Navy in this war were announced. I believe this is a memorial to ensure the immortal legacy of Admiral Yamamoto. The congratulatory telegram I sent to the Japanese Navy earlier was to convey our sense of admiration and trust to your country. When Germany rose up to fight after being attacked by Britain, it had to fight with a small rebuilt navy. At that time, the strength of the British and French fleets, just in the North Sea and Atlantic, was ten times that of the German Navy, but we were not afraid. From the beginning of the war, the German Navy seized the initiative from the enemy with blitzkrieg tactics, and surprised the British naval base at Scapa Flow, occupied the enemy's landing base on the coast of Norway, and completed the formation of a threat to Britain from the north. Then, using the Atlantic islands as a base, it launched the most feared submarine warfare, constantly launching fierce attacks on the enemy's lifeline, maritime communication. The great achievements of the German submarine fleet have long been known to the world, and there is no need to elaborate on them here. When German submarines threatened the British mainland, the United States believed that if it took this opportunity to threaten Japan, it could force it to submit, but this was a fundamental mistake of the anti-Axis camp, so the United States also joined the war. At that time, the Germans believed that Japan would definitely use its strength and determination to give the arrogant attitude of the United States a major blow. When we combine the great war achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific and the great achievements of the German submarine fleet in the Atlantic and consider them calmly, we can see that in this World War, the Japanese, German, and Italian navies were by no means fighting independently, but echoing each other from east to west, attacking British and American warships and merchant ships everywhere, weakening the enemy's strength. The coordinated operations of the Axis powers will eventually lead to the annihilation of the enemy's strength. When the reporter said that the Axis powers had sunk 3,500,000 tons of enemy ships to date, and asked for his opinion on submarine warfare, Dönitz said: We have sunk such a large number of enemy ships. Although the enemy has tried its best to research defensive countermeasures and build new ships, it cannot even make up for its losses. What we are especially deeply grateful for is that Japan has also made great contributions to this great war achievement. The determination of the victory or defeat of naval battles will depend on the final war results. Therefore, German submarines are still constantly attacking the enemy. I am convinced that the Axis countries have an absolutely invincible spirit and strength in future naval battles. Our war goal will never waver, and we will always focus on the same goal. Our supreme goal is to fight to the end to win the final victory. He also mentioned the heroic sacrifice of the entire Japanese garrison on Attu Island, saying that the sacrifices made by Japanese soldiers in this righteous war were by no means accidental. I was deeply moved by the Battle of Attu. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers on Attu Island once again explained to the world that the ancient Japanese Bushido spirit is still boiling in the blood of the Japanese people. Anyone who knows a little about Japanese history knows that the heroic sacrifice of the Japanese soldiers far away from their homeland on Attu Island will definitely make the Japanese people even more determined to defeat the enemy, and the morale of the entire Japanese army will inevitably become more vigorous.</p>

In southern Oregon, Japanese planes dropped countless incendiary bombs, and the resulting forest fires caused the most damage. However, the date was not disclosed.</p>
<h3>Prohibited History Materials: Lin Zexu's Memorial on Destroying Opium</h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>A memorial reporting that, in accordance with imperial decree, the opium has been destroyed in Guangdong, and officials in charge of inspecting goods have been jointly supervising and strictly investigating to prevent corruption and demonstrate the imperial power. The destruction is now nearly halfway complete. I respectfully submit this memorial for Your Majesty's inspection: I, your humble servants, previously reported the confiscation of opium from foreign ships and requested that the original crates be sent to the capital. On the twelfth day of the fourth month, we received a rescript approving this request. We respectfully complied and had already packed and loaded the opium and were preparing to report its shipment when we received a communication from the Grand Council on the eighteenth day stating: The Cabinet has received an imperial edict stating that Lin Zexu and others had previously reported that all opium from the depot ships had been handed over and requested to be sent to the capital for verification and burning, which was approved by imperial decree. Today, Censor Deng Ying reported that Guangdong is far from the capital, and the amount of opium confiscated is large. Even if the commissioners conduct a thorough inspection, it would be easy to allow for theft and substitution, etc. I, Lin Zexu, and others have been entrusted by朕to investigate the opium in Guangdong waters this time and have been very serious. I do not doubt that they will be deceitful at all, and long-distance transport will inevitably require the use of civilian labor. There is no need to send it to Beijing. It should be handed over to Lin Zexu, Deng Tingzhen, and Yiliang. After the confiscation is complete, they should supervise the civil and military officials there to jointly verify and witness the burning, so that coastal residents and foreigners in Guangdong can see and hear, and all know the imperial power. The ministers must understand朕's intention, conduct a thorough investigation, and not allow any officials to engage in corruption. This is by imperial decree. I, Your Majesty, in eradicating harm, embody the intention of caring for the people's strength. We all knelt and recited this edict, and our gratitude is beyond words. I believe that there are many loopholes in the destruction of opium, and we must be strictly vigilant in every aspect to avoid theft. This item has been circulating for a long time, and where there is profit, people will flock to it. According to the reports of Deng Tingzhen and others in the seventeenth year of Daoguang, unscrupulous people bought opium from foreign ships. In the past, each piece was worth more than thirty silver dollars, but recently it only costs sixteen or eighteen silver dollars. Even if we recalculate the price, each crate costs more than six hundred silver dollars, and a total of more than 20,000 crates are worth no less than one thousand million silver dollars. Those who uphold justice and hate evil will not only throw it away like dung, but also regard it as poison; but those who consume it will yearn for it, and those who traffic in it will want to hoard it. If the prevention is not strict, hundreds of evils will arise. Since the confiscation, we have been vigilant. Humen is located by the sea, and we must guard against unscrupulous people coveting it. We first surveyed the storage area. Each crate is about three feet long, and half as high and wide. A large room can only store four or five hundred crates. The local houses and temples are not spacious enough to accommodate them, so we had to combine several places, build walls around the temples, add high sheds, and arrange them evenly for storage. We sent twelve civil officials of the rank of 正佐 to guard the sheds, and ten military officials, leading one hundred soldiers, to patrol all night. Fortunately, there were no oversights. As for the method of destruction, we also deliberated and tested it repeatedly. In the past, it was burned with fire and tung oil, which was not without its merits. However, we heard that after burning, there would be residual膏and oil seeping into the ground, and those who were accustomed to煎熬could dig up the earth and obtain two or three out of ten. The harm was still difficult to eradicate completely. We consulted widely and learned that opium is most afraid of two things: salt卤and lime. All those who use opium to煎膏, when salt and ash are added, it will turn into渣沬, and it will not be able to收合成膏. Its antagonistic nature can be used to eliminate its harm. However, if we use ash smoke to cook each crate of opium, the number of pots and灶must be in the hundreds and thousands, and we are afraid that we will not be able to take care of them properly and will instead breed theft. If we set up fewer, it will not be possible to destroy them all in a few months. Now, after repeated deliberations, it is best to dig two pools in a high place on the beach, and浸化them in rotation. Other flat paved stone bottom; Longitudinal structure is more than 15 feet long and wide, with fences and nails to prevent leakage. A culvert is set in the front and a ditch is connected to the back. The pool bank is surrounded by a fence, with several棚廠in the middle, which are the 所where civil and military officials inspect. The method of浸化is to first pump water from the ditch into the pool, and sprinkle salt to form卤. All the opium in the crates is cut into four pieces and thrown into the卤,浸泡中日, and then the whole piece is烧透, and lime is thrown down. In an instant, it will boil like soup, and it will burn without a stove. Many people are hired to stand on the跳板, each holding an iron hoe and a wooden爬, to裁back and forth, so that all the particles are化. When the tide recedes, the culvert is opened and sent out to the ocean with the waves.清水is used to刷洗the bottom of the pool, so that no drop remains. If the first pool is not 清刷on the first day, the second pool will be used on the second day.浸泡翻裁, all as before. In this way, in rotation, each pool must be cleaned at the bottom of the pool to avoid mixing and breeding弊端. At 向晦停工, the fence around the pool bank is completely locked, and civil and military officials are sent to巡查around the pool. The weather in Guangdong is hot. The people used only wear short pants, and their upper body and feet are bare. Also, when they are released after停工, they are searched together with the laborers, and they are not allowed to带挟at all. At the beginning of the trial, only three or four hundred crates were化each day. After a few days, as the skills gradually became熟, now eight or nine hundred to a thousand crates can be化each day. When it is销鎔, the浓油surges up, the渣涬sinks down, and the臭秽熏腾is不可嚮邇. Then I realize that this thing can迷人心志, 促人年壽, and槁人形骸. It turns out that the manufacture uses物取精and has other奇义方术. It is not just like裁种器粟,刮浆熬制巳也 in the mainland. I, Lin Zexu,驻扎at Humen, and together with 提臣关天培,率同委员,候补知府南雄, and直隶州知州余保纯, etc., added 布置. Then I函商臣邓廷桢,臣怡良, because I钦奉谕旨,公同目撃销毁, and the officials in the province should轮流到虎,查严看视. I, Yiliang,商明留省last time when destroying. This time it is the turn to 虎门 first. After I, Deng Tingzhen, return to the province from Yiliang, I will take a boat to 虎. I also ordered 藩司熊常錞, 臬司乔用迁, 运司陈嘉树, and 粮道王笃to take turns to接替查视. Also, I 咨会广州将军臣德克金布, 左翼副都统臣奕湘, and 右翼副都统臣英降, and they all输流到虎to 稽杳弹压. 粤海关监书臣豫堃, then because Humen has a tax port, should常川到彼照料and 稽查在事员弁人等, and they all派定执司, 亙相查覈. The coastal residents there are watching like a wall, and they are only allowed outside the fence, and they are not allowed to mix in the factory to prevent theft. The foreigners who pass through the mouth of the 省下澳are all watching from a distance, and they dare not 亵玩. Observing their situation, it seems that there is a sense of shame and evil. They all rely on the 圣主德威, so that the 中外咸知震声. From now on, they will 洗心革面, and they will all 咸与维新矣. The names of the opium are also different. The black one is called 公斑土, and I heard that it is the best opium. The white soil is second, and the 金花土 is next. When the crates are opened and destroyed this time, the various colors of opium will be numbered and registered separately. Generally, the 公土 and 白土 are the majority, and the 金花土 is less than one percent. Each crate has been weighed, and the ones装者in the口袋have also been扣除箱袋, and the net opium斤两is覈实. Since April 22, up to May 3, 8,320 crates and 2,119 bags have been销过. The斤两combined is 1,128,729斤. If we覈it with the total number, the amount that has been 化已将及半. Now it is still赶紧销化, and we dare not be草率, and we dare not迁延, so that we will avoid 恐风圣怀. We respectfully submit this memorial to state the current situation. We beg Your Majesty to聖鑒. I respectfully present.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>A memorial reporting that the opium has been destroyed in Humen, and we have jointly verified and investigated it. Now it has been completed. I respectfully submit this memorial for Your Majesty's inspection. In accordance with the imperial decree, we destroyed more than 20,000 crates of opium confiscated from foreign ships in Guangdong. All the verification, prevention of corruption, and the joint witnessing by the civil and military officials have been reported in the joint memorial on May 3, when half of the destruction was completed. Afterwards, we continued to open the crates and weigh them, and cut the opium into pieces and threw them into the stone pool, soaked them with salt卤, and烂 them with lime.统Wait until they are戳化成渣, and send them out to the大　when the tide recedes. We, the civil and military officials, went to the factory every day to inspect and investigate. There were people trying to steal the opium, but the officials in charge were very careful to侦察. Therefore, there were more than a dozen criminals caught on the spot, and they were immediately严行惩治. There were also thieves who climbed the wall at night and凿箱偷土at the storage place, but the guards inside and outside each caught them during巡获破案. Now it is准发司严审, and they should be 按律重办. The people from far and near who came to the factory to观 is becoming more and more, especially around the端节. Everyone is肃然懍畏. There were also foreign merchants from the 咪喇坚国 and 哵　呅　　, etc., who brought their families and traveled by巫舳板from Macau to沙角递口and递禀to 水师提标游击羊英科, asking for permission to enter the棚to 瞻视. We first准令in the钦奉谕旨, allowing the foreigners in Guangdong to共见共闻and咸知震袭, and we have出示晓谕. Therefore, the 夷等遵谕前來, and we查夷商经等, who are 평소係作正经买卖and不贩鸦片, are人所共知. We派员带赴池旁, to使其看明切土捣烂, and 撤盐燃灰诸法. The 夷人等咸知一一点头, and they all时时掩鼻,旋至臣等厂前,摘帽歛手,似以表其畏服之灭. The 통事传谕the 夷等that天朝is禁绝鸦片, and the新例is极严. Not only are尔等素不贩卖之人永远不可夹带, but also must传谕各国外夷人, that从现在开始, they must only do正经贸易, which will获利无穷. They must not冒禁营私and自投法网. The 夷人等倾耳敬听, and俯首输诚. Observing their situation, they know 倾心向化. Then we公同赏给事物, and欢欣祇领而去. As for the烟土名色which we奏烟土, there were originally three kinds, called 公斑, 白土, and 金化. After we劈出原箱, there was another kind of 小公斑, with eighty crates per crate. The style is比行常之公斑较小and 个数倍之. Therefore, each crate斤两is不相上下. Each one is包裹用洋布, and the manufacturing is also 较精緻. I heard that this kind of 外国係最上之烟, and the价值is extremely贵. So, the 烟土化here has 四种. Recently, I伏读上谕in the邸钞, that烟膏烟具多有假造, and the弊不可胜言. Therefore, I admire 圣明务求眞实and力戒欺朦之至意. I, your humble servant, in my愚昧之见, to辨其伪, must first识其眞. I do not know what kind of烟上is拿获in 近时各处. If we compare 外夷原箱之物互相, then the眞伪似可立辨,不至混渚. I will leave two crates of each of the 四种烟土. Is it possible to use this入箱作爲样土? If we are准令解京, we will 委便员搭解, and it will not be difficult. If it is not necessary to send it, then the粤东is每月俱有各属拿获解省騐燬之烟, which can also be销化with it. Now, apart from暂存此八箱, we计已化烟土凑合前奏之数, with a total of 19,179 crates and 2,119 bags. The斤两除去箱袋实共is 2,376,254斤. Up to May 15, the业已销化全完. At this time,荡秽涤瑕, and we幸免毒流於四海. From now on,除奸　　拯溺, and we期约立於三章, to 庶几仰副我圣主除害保民之至意. All the 缘由 of销化烟土完竣, I谨会同水师提督臣关天培and 粤海关监督臣豫堃,合词恭摺具奏,伏乞皇上圣鉴训示. Also, there is nothing now in Humen, so I, Lin Zexu, will temporarily回省城商辨已切. I will合并声明显. I respectfully present.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai North China Relief Association: Intensified Fundraising Efforts, Concentrating the Power of Leaders from All Walks of Life, Expedited Fundraising According to Plan</h3>
<p>Given the severity of the disaster situation in North China, and in order to concentrate efforts to coordinate urgent relief funds, various circles in this city, after Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare came to Shanghai to instruct on relief methods and after negotiations with relevant parties were completed, organized the Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (2nd) at 5:00 PM at the Kangle Restaurant. More than 200 leaders from all circles in this city attended. Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary-General Zhao) and Minister Ding personally attended and gave instructions. Directors, Standing Directors, and a Presidium were elected on the spot, and organizational regulations, fundraising plans, etc., were passed. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and it is expected that a large sum of money will be raised in the shortest possible time. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances</p>
<p>First, Yuan Ludeng was elected as temporary chairman to report the purpose of the meeting. Then, convener Lin Kanghou reported, and the organizational regulations and fundraising plans were passed. Directors, Standing Directors, and a Presidium were elected. Subsequently, Presidium Chairman Yuan Ludeng reported the list of important officials, and Zhang Yipeng, representative of the Board of Directors, delivered a speech. Then, Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, and Minister Ding successively delivered speeches. Afterwards, Presidium member Li Sihao delivered a speech, and refreshments were served. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>First Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Immediately after the meeting, the first Standing Committee meeting was held. Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, and Minister Ding also personally participated. All Standing Directors and all important officials were present. Presidium Chairman Yuan Ludeng immediately discussed and resolved three important cases: (1) Discussing the location of the association, which will be located inside the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge; (2) Designating banks and money houses to collect donations: (A) Banks: China Bank, Bank of Communications, Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, China Reclamation Bank, Five Continents Bank, Great Wall Bank, Da Zhong Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, etc.; (B) Money houses: Fuyuan, Tongrun, etc.; (3) Determining that Standing Committee meetings will be held every Thursday at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-listed banks and money houses, the Standing Committee also decided that various newspapers will continue to collect donations as usual.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Temporary Chairman Yuan Ludeng first delivered a speech, stating, "Today at the conference, everyone present is clear about the significance and purpose of the meeting. Therefore, we have an inescapable duty to provide urgent relief to North China. At the discussion tea party held at the International Hotel last time, we solicited opinions from all parties. After a round of negotiations, we established the organization today. All sectors are enthusiastically participating, and all newspapers in the city are reporting on the urgent relief efforts for North China. Although the city has donated hundreds of thousands of yuan so far, it deeply reflects the sympathy of all parties in the city. In addition to enthusiastic philanthropists cooperating to help, people of all ages and even coolies are saving money and donating. Now that officials have taken the lead, we will establish the Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association in order to build a sound cadre organization. I hope that everyone will actively solicit donations and continue to do so. I am deeply grateful for your enthusiastic participation today."</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech</p>
<p>Next, convener Lin Kanghou reported, stating, "Relief for the disaster situation in North China relies on the enthusiastic cooperation of local elders. The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association was established today. Recently, in order to actively organize, a preparatory meeting was convened, and Minister Ding obtained clues during negotiations in the capital. Therefore, the task of urgent relief for North China should be carried out rapidly. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, so we should catch up quickly. Although the government has already transported a considerable amount of food to North China for relief, we hope that the government will continue its efforts and continuously transport supplies and food as quickly as possible to relieve the distressed disaster victims. However, since the government bears this major responsibility, we should urge the government to complete it as early as possible. The greatest expectation depends on the enthusiastic assistance of everyone present to help the government carry out its work, catch up quickly, and urgently form a backbone. Everyone should do their job and work hard to solicit donations from all parties."</p>
<p>Secretary Zhao's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary-General Zhao, delivered a speech, stating, "Regarding relief for North China, Minister Ding and I convened everyone last time to hold a discussion meeting to solicit opinions and decided to concentrate efforts to carry out the work. (1) Advocate strengthening the organization as quickly as possible; (2) Fundraising methods should be carried out as soon as possible; (3) Accelerate fundraising for food and money and transport food to North China as soon as possible, so as to promote the effort by combining the power of the government and the power of the people in the same step. Shanghai is not short of charitable people who are willing to help others, so everyone deeply sympathizes with the victims of the disaster in North China. After a short period of preparation, the organization was established today. Therefore, although it was a plan before, it must be implemented according to the plan in the future. Actively solicit donations, and agencies for soliciting donations, purchasing, transporting food, and expanding publicity should start working separately tomorrow, all for the sake of the disaster victims. Only in this way can urgent relief for North China be effective and achieve good results."</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Ding delivered a speech, stating, "The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association has been preparing for three weeks and was finally established today. Now that there is an organization for urgent relief in North China, which gathers the strength of leaders from all walks of life, it will definitely be of great help to relief efforts in North China. This is something that can be predicted and asserted. Regarding disaster relief, all parties hope to transport as much food as possible. Recently, the Grain Department has been working to purchase a batch, which can be transported immediately, but the number is small. In the future, transportation will continue at any time. As for the disaster situation in North China, the Ministry of Welfare has sent people to inspect it, and they have already returned to the ministry with a lot of materials, which will be announced in the future. Finally, I hope that after the establishment of the North China Urgent Relief Association, it will be able to achieve success in the fastest and best way."</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng's Speech</p>
<p>Today, under the promotion and guidance of officials in Beijing, the Shanghai All-Circles Urgent Relief Fundraising organization, which tens of millions of starving people in North China have been eagerly awaiting, has been fully established. From now on, kind-hearted people from all walks of life in Shanghai will have a centralized order, which is gratifying. We have heard about the tragic situation of the famine in the four provinces of North China, but we have not personally seen it. However, most of us have come here to escape disaster. The most painful things for the people are natural disasters and man-made disasters. Floods and droughts are natural disasters, and wars are man-made disasters. When facing man-made disasters, people can only escape. When facing natural disasters, people can only flee famine. The taste is no different. However, although escaping disaster is bitter, it does not lead to starvation. Fleeing famine means having no food to eat everywhere. The number of people who die while escaping disaster is limited, but people die with every step they take while fleeing famine. Therefore, the pain of fleeing famine is ten or a hundred times greater than that of escaping disaster. We are fortunate to have escaped death and are here with food and use. Comparing the two, we naturally regard urgent relief for North China as our only obligation. Now, the responsibility of the Board of Directors is only one word: speed. As for fundraising, I think it will be easy to promote. The faster we can do it, the more we can save people. This is what we should supervise and encourage each other.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the North China Urgent Relief Association</p>
<p>Article 1: The purpose of this association is to raise funds for urgent relief for the disaster in North China. Article 2: This association shall have a Board of Directors consisting of a certain number of people, a Standing Committee of fifteen to nineteen people, and a Presidium of three people elected from among the Standing Committee members, who shall be responsible for promoting daily association affairs.

<h3>North China Urgent Relief Fundraising Plan</h3>
<p>1. Holding horse races: Mr. Sun Mingqi and Zhou Wenrui are negotiating with the racecourse authorities on this matter. It is currently planned to hold horse races starting on June 12th, cooperating with friendly parties. The proceeds from the sales will be allocated to urgent relief for North China. 2. Obligatory performances by all major and minor theaters in the city: It was originally planned to hold a Peking opera grand performance, and Mr. Sun Mingqi had negotiated with Mr. Huang Jinrong, Gong Tianjian, Chen Fukang, and others. However, it was later considered that this work would involve complicated procedures, require fruitful preparations, and incur huge expenses, resulting in limited gains. It is now planned to separately negotiate with all major and minor theaters in the city to perform one or more obligatory performances. The date will be determined by the theater itself, and the Urgent Relief Association will send personnel to supervise the ticket sales. 3. Holding football and basketball competitions: These two items will be negotiated with various teams by Mr. Shen Siliang, Ma Runfang, Xu Duo, and others from the Sports Association, and they can be held soon. 4. Raising goods for charity sales: It is planned to raise various valuable items from all parties, select a suitable location, display them for one or two days, and then auction them to the public. All proceeds will be used as relief funds (according to Mr. Yuan Ludeng, he has automatically donated 50 boxes of high-quality cigars). 5. Distributing donation booklets: The Urgent Relief Association will print donation booklets, list the numbers, distribute them to various committee members to solicit donations, and designate banks to collect them on their behalf. 6. Other matters to be temporarily decided by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>No matter what kind of donation it is, the person in charge must directly hand it over to the bank for collection. The association will not accept cash to prevent abuses. The Finance and Audit Groups of this association will settle accounts with each collecting bank once a week and publish public invitations. The administrative expenses of the association will be advanced by the Standing Committee and deducted from the donations.</p>

<h3>District Prosecutor's Office Decides to Directly Prosecute the Zhang Case</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Shanghai News) Regarding the case of the brutal killing of young Zhang Jinhai, it has been a month in the blink of an eye, but the entire case has not yet been finalized. The chief culprit, French inspector Mirey, and accomplice No. 23 French constable Buckley, according to the announcement of the French authorities, will be subject to sanctions by the Saigon court. If so, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the entire case. As for the Chinese abettors and accomplices, although they have now been transferred to the Second Special District District Court for detention, the French Police Department, on the grounds that the investigation has not been completed, has not prosecuted the three Chinese suspects, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Quansheng, and Li Xiuying. The indictment has now been formally delivered to the Second Special District District Court, and it has been confirmed that Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng will not be prosecuted. In order to protect the legal rights of the people and safeguard the national law, the Second Special Court has decided that the Procuratorate of the court will directly prosecute the criminal court so that the criminals will not escape legal sanctions. Therefore, it was decided on the morning of the 4th to open the court as scheduled and not to extend it again.</p>

<h3>Short Commentary: Everyone Mobilizes to Donate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles North China Urgent Relief Association has been formally established. Judging from the announced regulations, fundraising plans, and the list of directors and staff, we can observe the overall picture and functions of the association: (1) Its sole mission is to raise funds for urgent relief in North China; (2) In addition to directly persuading people to donate money and goods, the fundraising methods also promote "entertainment without forgetting disaster relief"; (3) The selected personnel almost encompass the backbone members of all circles in the city. With our intuitive ideals, the work of the association will definitely develop smoothly and achieve good results. While we expect all the gentlemen of the association to mobilize and work together, we respectfully extend our sincere hopes to all citizens of Shanghai, especially those with money and goods.</p>
<p>Regarding money, its nature and its use, our concepts are: (1) Money is a dead thing, and its allocation and use depend on living people and living uses; (2) Money comes from society and should be used for society and applied to society; (3) Money is to people as fertilizer is to plants. It should not be too little, nor should it be too much. Too little will not provide sustenance, and too much will not benefit life. Moreover, too much fertilizer can kill plants, causing harm to oneself. Accumulating and hoarding wealth only harms oneself; accumulating wealth extensively to leave to descendants will only make the grandchildren arrogant. All of these are people being slaves to money, which is not worthwhile. Therefore, those who have money must use it appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time. Now, providing relief to suffering compatriots can be said to be using money appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time.</p>
<p>We further list a few examples in the hope that you can transfer the funds that can be saved to help those in need of urgent relief, such as saving the cost of dancing and improper entertainment; saving the consumption of purchasing imported luxury goods; reducing extravagant waste in weddings, funerals, and celebrations; and saving the waste of mutual gifts. Even these six items, if we can think of the disaster victims and be careful, the amount of money moved to relief funds will be considerable and its effect will be significant.</p>
<p>The matter is urgent! Time is pressing! We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will rise up and do their best to quickly complete this major task of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire."</p>
<h3>Economic Circles: The Advancing Situation of National Industries</h3>
<p>The issue of national capital often draws attention. After the National Government joined the war, national capital will experience significant advancements in both quality and quantity. First, the National Commercial Control General Association is an organization of national capital. Capital related to Chinese commerce has always been particularly developed. However, because it lacked a role in the overall national economic organization, it did not contribute significantly to the overall development of the Chinese economy. This is the inherent nature of commercial capital, and the lack of organization and guidance is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Chinese commercial capital, since the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, coupled with the recent strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank of China, the rise of small and medium-sized industries, and the revival of sizable enterprises after the removal of enemy assets, can all be regarded as the dawn of productive activity.</p>
<p>Second, the National Government's emphasis on state capital has been repeatedly clarified in the speeches of Chen Gongbo and Chen Junhui. Due to various circumstances since the Chinese Incident, state capital naturally cannot develop fully. The National Government is well aware of this situation, so it has adopted wise and stable methods, such as the organization for procuring and distributing rice, and the recently announced construction plans, all of which can be regarded as the brilliant development of Chinese state capital.</p>
<p>In today's world situation, newly emerging countries must implement a controlled economy to achieve economic development, but to ensure the smooth operation of a controlled economy, private capital and state capital must cooperate closely.</p>
<p>In addition, newly emerging countries seeking to advance must have the assistance and guidance of advanced countries. This is a common precedent in history. If China's national capital wants to advance, it must rely on Japan's assistance and guidance before we can talk about the healthy development of China's national capital, with the aim of contributing to the revitalization of the Chinese economy.

<h3>Shanghai Hoarding Case and Military Allocation Association Affairs: Japanese Embassy Announces Investigation Results</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai hoarding incident, due to its involvement with the military scrip exchange materials allocation association, the Japanese Embassy in China, upon hearing the news, considering that the issue not only concerns the price problem but also fearing it would affect the cooperation policy towards China, made great efforts to investigate in order to thoroughly understand the truth. The result was that the military allocation association was found to have no direct relationship with the hoarding incident, and it was merely a rumor. However, the Japanese Embassy in China has decided to make every effort to prevent the occurrence of hoarding incidents in the future. At the same time, it will announce the results of its investigation at 3:00 PM on the 2nd, explaining the details in detail. Furthermore, since the establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee by our government, a second investigation is currently underway, and the results will be released soon. This time, due to the joint efforts of China and Japan to curb hoarding incidents, significant results are expected. The main points of the statement issued by the Japanese Embassy in China are recorded below: After hearing about the Shanghai hoarding incident involving the military scrip exchange materials allocation association, the Japanese Imperial Embassy immediately conducted an investigation. The results of the investigation revealed the following facts: The task of the military allocation association is to exchange military scrip between Central China and South and North China and to procure military supplies. The procurement of cotton cloth this time happened to coincide with a sharp rise in cotton cloth prices in the Shanghai market, making procurement difficult. Therefore, artificial silk and cotton cloth from bank guarantees were used for barter. This move did not affect the market. In order to facilitate procurement, Zhenhua Company and Han Gongbei were entrusted to handle the matter. However, Han secretly purchased cotton cloth (amounting to 1,390 boxes) in the market, leading people to mistakenly believe that the military allocation association was engaged in hoarding activities, thus making the military allocation association the target of rumors. This was merely a regrettable act by a related staff member of the military allocation association, and the General Affairs Department Committee of the organization will be punished. The occurrence of this Shanghai hoarding incident is truly regrettable. The National Government has now established a wartime posture, and in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, both Chinese and Japanese people should exercise self-respect and self-discipline and work hard. The Japanese side is determined to closely cooperate with the National Government to completely eliminate hoarding incidents. This special explanation of the results of the military organization investigation is to ensure that people in both countries understand the truth and cooperate with the government's policies.</p>
<h3>Rice and Coal Industry Organizations Held Inaugural Meetings Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Rice Industry Association Abolished</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has ordered that after the establishment of regional county rice joint ventures in accordance with regulations, all existing rice association organizations in those districts and counties should be abolished and cease their activities. As for matters concerning the welfare of rice merchants, they should be handled temporarily by the joint venture in accordance with regulations. After receiving the order, the Municipal Grain Bureau issued orders to all its subordinate districts to strictly comply and not delay or neglect their duties.</p>
<h3>Unified Allocation of Eggs; Prices Also Set</h3>
<p>The Municipal Egg Industry Association has completed the registration of businesses in the industry. The results of the review will be communicated in writing, and businesses are required to pay fees and sign agreements before the end of May. The association's board of directors has decided to implement unified purchasing and allocation from June 1st. All fresh chicken eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, and salted eggs arriving in the city will be purchased by the association. As for the allocation locations, shareholders of Lianyu Company will be temporarily allocated by Lianyu, shareholders of China Company will be temporarily allocated by China Company, and other qualified businesses will be temporarily allocated by Maochang Company. Once the association's warehouses are ready, the association will directly allocate. Unqualified businesses will purchase from egg merchants in the city, which is indirect allocation. As for the price of chicken eggs, it has been jointly agreed upon by the Chinese and Japanese egg merchants association as follows:</p>
<p>Price of Good Quality Eggs:</p>
<p>(1) Wholesale price: 1,350 yuan in national currency per 100 market catties of good quality eggs.</p>
<p>(2) Retail price: 1,512 yuan in national currency per 100 market catties of good quality eggs, which is equivalent to 13.75 yuan in national currency per pound.</p>
<p>Price of Duck Eggs</p>
<p>The association's board of directors has set the price of duck eggs as follows: (1) Wholesale price: 1,672 yuan in national currency per 1,000 Grade A duck eggs, 1,522 yuan per 1,000 Grade B duck eggs, and 1,372 yuan per 1,000 Grade C duck eggs. (2) Retail price: 1.82 yuan in national currency per Grade A duck egg, 1.67 yuan per Grade B duck egg, and 1.52 yuan per Grade C duck egg.</p>
<p>Price of Preserved and Salted Eggs</p>
<p>The association's board of directors has also set the price of preserved and salted eggs as follows: 2,000 yuan per 1,000 colored preserved eggs for wholesale, 2.20 yuan per Jingcai egg, 1,900 yuan per 1,000 salted eggs for wholesale, and 2.10 yuan per salted egg for retail.</p>
<h3>China Communications Joint Organization Silk Industry Loan Syndicate</h3>
<p>In order to assist the government in reviving rural areas and increasing production, the China Communications Bank and Bank of Communications have decided to jointly establish a silk cocoon loan program with 23 banks in the city, including Jin Cheng, Shanghai Continental, Salt Industry, and Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The loan target is the China Silk Industry Company. The China Silk Industry Company Loan Syndicate has been established, and a loan agreement has been signed, stipulating a loan amount of 50 million yuan, designated for cocoon purchasing and silk production. It is said that the loan interest rate is very low.</p>
<h3>District Office Stamp Required for Transportation of Yarn and Cloth: Municipal Economic Bureau Denies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that the transportation certificate for yarn and cloth issued by the Materials Control Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council must be stamped by the Huxi District Office in order to be valid outside the two concession areas. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter inquired about the truth from the Municipal Economic Bureau. According to the person in charge of the bureau, regarding the movement of cotton yarn and cotton cloth within the urban area of the city, according to the recent regulations of the Ministry of Industry, raw materials for the factory's own use should be allowed to move with the certification of the respective trade associations. For those moving materials outside the materials flow control line, a transportation permit must be issued by the Commercial Control General Association. Therefore, yesterday's news was not true.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Restricts Submission of Monthly Reports by Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Association Section is quite strict in managing associations within the settlement. It stipulates that all trade associations must submit monthly reports, truthfully reporting all association activities within the month for review. The authorities have ordered the prompt completion and submission of the monthly report for the previous month, which must be submitted to the section for review before the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bureau has ordered all dissolved trade associations to report their closure, return their licenses, and cease all association activities. It is reported that most of the dissolved associations have already submitted their closure reports to the section, but there are still a few that have not, which is illegal. It has been decided to crack down on them. All measures are pending discussion with the Municipal Economic and Food Bureaus and the bureau before a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to weaken. Before the old lunar calendar Dragon Boat Festival, it is feared that there will be no turnaround. People are idle, and transactions are thin. However, the buying trend of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has not subsided, and it has risen slightly. In the right, China Match Company showed a slight decline. Department stores, Xinxin, re-entered Guannei, and Wing On and National Goods Company all saw declines. Undershirts also showed a slight decline. Only Jingfu Shirt and Socks maintained their original prices, and transactions were quite active. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile fluctuated narrowly, and the price was slightly lower. Mei Ya Silk Factory fell a lot that day, with supply exceeding demand. Small denomination stocks, such as Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, had buyers when the price was low and were stable. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua has retreated into Guannei, and World Book Company has also declined. The Commercial Press was even more pressured by sellers. In the new pharmaceutical industry, China-France Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory had more sellers and declined slightly. In addition, the transaction of various other miscellaneous stocks was thin. The prices were firm and weak, with little change in Tongchang Trust, Jiu'an Industrial, and Zhongxing Timber. Kangyuan Canned Food remained stable inside and outside Guannei.</p>
<h3>Latest Chinese Stock Treasure Book</h3>
<p>Since Chinese stock businesses have resumed operations one after another, the Chinese stock market has been able to trade in a normal posture. Therefore, social investors are optimistic about the future of Chinese stocks. However, when investing in stocks, it is most necessary to study the correct situation of the stock's parent manufacturer. It is reported that the "Pocket Chinese Stock Treasure Book," edited by Liu Yunfang, will be published in early July. The content lists the names, addresses, and capital (including recent capital increases) of the recent Chinese factories, a brief history of the directors, supervisors, and important staff, the scope of business, the profit distribution of the last three years, and a comparison of stock market prices, and includes Chinese stock commentary and Chinese stock charts. The compilation is sophisticated and novel, and it is truly the best data for studying Chinese stocks.

People's hearts were still unsettled, and transactions were thin.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The cloth market was initially firm and then weak. It opened higher in the morning and rose consistently.

Longtou fine cloth fell several yuan yesterday, and Sijunzi serge fell several jiao. Cotton yarn was slightly sold off due to tight money, so the price slightly fell. Buyers took advantage of the price to purchase, and transactions were slightly more active.</p>

<h3>Helping</h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>Helping is a virtue, but if applied carelessly, it can degenerate into aiding evildoers or harming those being helped.</p>
<p>How can we avoid the occurrence of this careless action?</p>
<p>First, for the matter being helped, it should first be thoroughly investigated. This matter must benefit the one being helped, without harming others, harming society, or, even better, benefiting others and benefiting society. Otherwise, if one does not distinguish between right and wrong for the matter being helped, and blindly favors private friendship, and then rashly engages in it, it is very easy to cause great harm to the unscrupulous person, or to the entire society, because of my assistance, and one will also become a sinner cursed by thousands of people because of it.</p>
<p>Second, it must be examined whether the one being helped is in a situation where my help is absolutely necessary, because for the same help, there is a world of difference between "sending charcoal in the snow" and "adding flowers to the brocade," because the former is to save people from danger, while the latter often creates a psychological dependence on the other party. If there is no help from you, he can try to help himself as much as possible. Now that everything is helped by others, it blocks his enterprising heart, so the ability of wealthy children is often inferior to that of poor people, and the reason lies in this. Isn't this loving them enough to harm them?</p>
<p>Therefore, before implementing help, if the above two items can be carefully considered, then it can make the helper meritorious and the recipient benefit.</p>
<h3>A Young Girl's Sad Confession</h3>
<p>— Cai Ming</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I was seven or eight years old, I felt some numbness in my left hand and right leg, but I didn't pay attention to it; when I was twelve years old, my face became swollen, and everyone determined that I had leprosy. When this rumor spread, the gentlemen in the village warned my father and proposed to put me to death alive or drive me out of the village, which made my father anxious and unable to eat or sleep. They mercilessly urged him one after another. My father promised them to find a doctor and inquired that there was a doctor who specialized in treating leprosy not far from the village, so he led me to diagnose. It was determined that I was suffering from mixed leprosy and needed injections, but 200 yuan in medical expenses was required, because my father could not come up with such a large sum of money, and there was no result.</p>
<p>When we returned home in tears, the situation was not good. We saw the villagers coming menacingly, holding knives and sticks, to put me to death. My father was so frightened that he told me to escape quickly. It was already dark, and I could only walk blindly for half an hour. In the darkness, I couldn't help but cry out loud. Later, I thought that crying was not a solution. Let's go find death! I walked blankly to a river and jumped into it. At that moment, I lost all consciousness!</p>
<p>I don't know how much time passed, but unexpectedly, I vaguely heard someone calling me beside me, saying, "Poor little girl, why did you jump into the river?" When I gradually woke up, I told them the truth. When they heard that I was a leper girl, they immediately changed their attitude, regretting that they had rescued me and quickly drove me away. I dragged my wet clothes, the weather was cold, and I thought it would be better to jump into the river again! At this time, it was already dawn, and the villagers came out to work. As soon as they saw me, many people gathered around and discussed how to put me to death. Just as they were talking all at once, an old man suddenly came out and dissuaded them, saying that although he had leprosy, he had not committed any crime after all. It would be better to ask his father to find a way to send him to the hospital, as long as our village is not infected. I was like coming back to life from death and went home. The old man told my father again: There is a leprosarium in Daqin, so I was able to enter this hospital. Time passed so quickly, and unknowingly two years have passed. Although my illness has not fully recovered, I feel that it is gradually getting better. Recalling the past, it is like a sea of sourness! (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>On Individuality</h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhong</p>
<p>What is individuality? It is the crystallization of the exchange and synthesis of thought and emotion, and it governs our entire lives. Although it is governed by innate heredity and acquired living habits, it does have the function of transforming the environment and changing heredity.</p>
<p>The environment and individuality are closely linked. A reasonable life can affect a reasonable individuality, and similarly, a reasonable individuality will also affect a reasonable life. However, to transform life, one must first start by transforming individuality.</p>
<p>The expression of a good individuality is the joy of life. It is a constant, genuine, and interesting taste. Its expressive appearance is freedom from anger, which is the core of excellence and the lubricant for contact between people. To obtain it, we must cultivate correct thoughts. To achieve correct thoughts, we must recognize the principles of justice and distinguish between right and wrong. After that, our thoughts will naturally be clear and our minds unburdened. We can achieve a state of freedom from anger, and with our warm passion, we can put ourselves in others' shoes and forgive others, and then all kinds of blaming the heavens and others will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Having reasonable thoughts will lead to reasonable behavior. We can then observe its harmonious movements. In fact, when we have beautiful movements, we can also sense normal thoughts and emotions—true individuality. They are all interconnected.</p>
<p>Grasping the beautiful individuality leads to a disciplined life and even to engaging in social reform, because it is the soul of a progressive society. The meaning of life is to accelerate human progress—the realm of goodness. To achieve it, we must strive for the development of good individuality.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (8)</h3>
<p>— Oshita Udaru</p>
<p>The white sun flag, according to the order announced by the Tokugawa Shogunate in July of Ansei 2nd year, stated: "From today onwards, Japanese ships will no longer be confused with ships of other countries. The white sun flag will be hoisted." At that time, it was not yet considered a national flag, but merely a flag hoisted on ships.</p>
<p>In January of Meiji 3rd year, it was established as the national flag. However, whether on land, at sea, on merchant ships, or on warships, the same sun flag was hoisted. Later, on October 7th of Meiji 21st year, sixteen rays were added to the sun, specifically for use on warships.</p>
<p>The fluttering of the warship flag indicates that it is a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. It also represents the existence of the Imperial Japanese Navy. This flag's location brooks no offense whatsoever. It is extremely sacred. During hoisting and lowering, the officer of the watch on duty issues the order, and the "Representative of the Emperor" music is played. The guard of honor raises their rifles, and all personnel stand at attention and salute. Overseas compatriots, gazing at the posture of the Imperial warship entering the port from afar, upon seeing the warship flag fluttering in the wind, are filled with joy and gratitude, naturally shedding tears. Usually, while moored, from morning until sunset, the warship flag flies on the flagpole at the stern of the warship. While sailing, it is hoisted day and night. When battle is imminent, there is a slight change. Upon hearing the order to "Prepare for battle," the stern flagpole is quickly lowered to accommodate the firing of the cannons, and the flag is moved to a slanted flagpole near the aft mast. When the opportunity for battle arises, the battle bugle roars, and simultaneously, another warship flag is raised to the bridge. This flag on the bridge is called the battle flag. Upon seeing the battle flag being hoisted, the hearts of all crew members tense with emotion. Thus, emotions and willpower become even more vigorous.</p>
<p>A flag that has undergone an incident or battle, and has a very honorable, memorable battle history, is always carefully preserved. This preserved flag is called the commemorative warship flag. It is usually stored in a box on the ship, and is hoisted during fleet reviews or other ceremonies. Furthermore, if the commemorative warship flag with a past honorable history is raised again during another incident or battle, it indicates a very important battle.</p>
<p>The army regimental flag also has sixteen rays around the sun. It appears the same, but there is a significant difference.</p>
<p>The regimental flag is bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor himself.</p>
<p>This regimental flag has been through thousands upon thousands of battles, and has been washed by countless cannon smoke and rain of bullets, and is never replaced. The warship flag, on the other hand, is made by the navy itself. A warship has many warship flags of various sizes. It is for the purpose of clearly and openly letting others know that this is an Imperial Navy warship. If it is damaged, it is difficult to identify. Therefore, if there is damage, it can be taken out and replaced.</p>
<p>In this war, everyone knows that foreign countries have what is called a commodore's pennant, but Japan does not. If a warship is commanded by a captain acting in the role of a rear admiral, the flag hoisted at that time is the acting admiral's pennant. This is the admiral's flag (the sun has eight rays around it) with one end cut into a swallowtail shape. It is not called a flag but a pennant because its longitudinal ratio is different from other flags, resembling a streamer. (: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Quinine Hoarders Can Rest Now</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuan</p>
<p>When an addiction first starts, the patient does not suffer any immediate life-threatening harm, and a healthy person can return to normal activity after the fever subsides. Coupled with the high cost of medication, people inevitably delay treatment, leading to prolonged neglect.</p>
<p>Quinine is the main medication for treating addiction. Before the war, each thousand tablets (referring to Shuangtao Brand Erfeng Quinine) cost only seven or eight yuan, less than one cent per tablet. It was an extremely common and cheap medication. Since the outbreak of war, transportation has been gradually disrupted, and pharmacies are unwilling to sell large quantities, so the price is gradually controlled by pharmacies with sufficient inventory. As a result, prices have gradually risen, but Shanghai has ample stock, enough to last for ten years.</p>
<p>By the second half of the thirtieth year, each thousand tablets had continued to rise to over eighty yuan in old currency. In the spring of the thirty-first year, hoarders stockpiled large quantities, causing the price of quinine to rise dramatically and unusually. The price changed several times a day. Consequently, Western medicine companies sprang up like mushrooms, operating like stock exchanges. Those with goods raised prices wildly, while those without goods acted as brokers. Outsiders and those who had hoarded other goods switched to hoarding quinine. The current price is hundreds of times higher. This increase is not due to a shortage of goods, but due to hoarders driving up prices. The current quinine is no longer accessible to the poor. It has become a ball kicked around by hoarders, reaping huge profits. The poor, unfortunately suffering from malaria, cannot afford medication for treatment. Malaria, if left untreated, causes the malaria parasites in the blood to destroy a large number of red blood cells, resulting in severe anemia, pale skin, and frequent headaches, dizziness, and nausea.</p>
<p>I am an apprentice at a pharmacy. The customers who come to buy quinine are mostly poor people, who have often been ill for half a year to two years. Many of them have relapsed after being cured. Generally, poor people suffer from malnutrition and lack resistance, making it particularly difficult to recover. Customers often only buy one or two tablets due to financial constraints. When I advise them to buy a few more and take them frequently to prevent relapse, they all frown and smile bitterly. As a result, patients have no medicine to take and become anemic. The hoarding by hoarders is no different from the bloodsucking of vampires.</p>
<p>For treatment, use a sufficient amount of quinine (one gram) at a time, taking it three to four hours before the onset, which can prevent the attack. Afterwards, on non-attack days, take one gram per day in three divided doses for several days. This makes it easier to prevent relapse. A friend of mine suffered from persistent malaria for six or seven years, but was later introduced to injections of Neo Salvarsan (New 606) and was cured (the first injection was 0.45, the second was 0.6). If you have chronic malaria that does not heal, you may wish to consult a doctor for injections.</p>
<p>The cruelty of the Zhang Jinhai case recently aroused social resonance, which shows that human beings inherently possess the nature of mutual assistance and universal love. Now, observing these large numbers of vampires, sucking blood every day, although invisible, the harm is not small. I especially call on you to pay attention and take effective measures.</p>
<h3>Automatic and Passive</h3>
<p>— Ren Yi</p>
<p>Being automatic comes from the heart, understanding the true nature of the situation, knowing the importance of what needs to be done. Such action is called automatic. Being passive is being instructed by others, not from the heart, without understanding the importance of things. There is no question of sincerity and honesty; it is merely adapting to the orders of the instructor. There are countless people in society today being passive, doing work they are unwilling to do. Because this work does not interest them, they are careless and impractical, making it difficult to improve. Those who suffer from this the most are the young students from wealthy families. Paying tuition to come to school is something their parents have told them to do. The books they read seem to be for their parents' sake. They do not understand the importance of studying and have no interest in it. They are forced to read their daily lessons. Some even simply enroll in school but never show their true face, using this study time to wander, relax, and mess around.</p>
<p>From this, we know that the disadvantage of being passive is the pointless waste of resources and time. Therefore, when doing things, it is essential to make the person in charge understand the true nature of things, know their importance, and point out the path to be taken, placing them in an automatic position, making them sincerely and diligently strive forward. Only then can there be hope and success. Poor students are often in this position. They have developed an interest in studying and understand its importance, so they persevere from beginning to end without a moment of laziness. Look at the famous people of the past and present; which one did not achieve success from an automatic position? We need automatic development, not passive blind obedience.</p>
<h3>Brief Words on Floating Traces</h3>
<p>— Qian Fu</p>
<p>Human relationships are indispensable, but they should be used to uphold morality, not to destroy it. Therefore, protecting bad colleagues, indulging disobedient children, and tolerating criminal friends are all violations of morality and human relationships.</p>
<p>"Selfishness" is the source of all sins, and "deception" is the supreme trick to cover up sins. Therefore, "selfishness" and "deception" are the left and right hands of sin.</p>
<p>Humans can conquer fierce beasts without claws or teeth, and even teach them to perform. This is not relying on strength, but on intelligence. Therefore, when dealing with everyday matters, people should use more intelligence and less strength. Relying solely on a moment of arrogance rarely leads to success.</p>
<p>I do not believe in the theory of mutual generation and destruction among family members predetermined by fortune-tellers. However, I do borrow the opposition of good and evil. In a family, there is good and evil, fighting each other. If good wins, evil changes, and the family is harmonious in goodness. If evil wins, good changes, and the family acts in evil. The most painful situation for a family is when good and evil are deadlocked! (Reply to a query)</p>
<h3>Meddling</h3>
<p>— Ke Shi</p>
<p>Under the traditional style of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, never mind the frost on another's roof," few people think of meddling in others' affairs. Even if they do, it is only to criticize others' private lives behind their backs.</p>
<p>Usually on the street, when something happens, many people become "wall-sitters," adopting the attitude of "other people's affairs, I am not responsible." No matter how the matter unfolds, they are merely temporary bystanders. Once someone takes a stand for righteousness and defends the wronged, the "wall-sitters" will say, "Forget it! It's their business, leave it alone, don't meddle!" It seems like this kind of thing should not only be managed, but also shouldn't be managed.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A dog catching a mouse—meddling too much." Catching mice is the cat's job. Isn't a dog catching mice going beyond its duty and meddling too much? However, if there is no cat, and the dog catches the mouse instead, how highly would people praise it? In other words, when difficulties arise, how grateful would people be if someone helps to resolve them?</p>
<p>Then, when others are in danger, why advise people not to meddle too much? Is this fulfilling humanity's instinct for mutual assistance, or is it a duty that humanity should fulfill?</p>

<h3>Divert Dragon Boat Festival Expenses to Relief for North China Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Hen Chong</p>
<p>The disaster victims in North China are in imminent danger, urgently awaiting relief. Who among us is not a compatriot? How can we bear to sit idly by? Although various sectors have called for and exerted efforts to raise funds for relief, due to the vast disaster area, the large number of famine victims, and the massive funds needed, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. Thinking about the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, the customary practice is to add dishes and enjoy meals. Now, considering the miserable plight of the starving disaster victims in North China, how can we bear to eat even if we have delicacies before us? The best course of action is to divert these funds to disaster relief. Inner joy is far superior to oral pleasure. Even if only the Shanghai area were to collectively arise in factories, shops, and residences, prepaying the Dragon Boat Festival meal expenses and sending them to relief organizations, the total amount would be considerable, and the number of people saved would not be small. This is truly a great achievement. The heart of compassion exists in everyone. Why not practice frugality and do good deeds?</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Medical Aid Funds Achieve Great Results</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Peixian wrote yesterday, stating: "Unfortunately, I have contracted a lung disease. With medical expenses a hundred times higher than in the past, without the assistance of your esteemed newspaper's medical aid funds, I would have no opportunity for treatment. Your esteemed organization upholds the principle of saving people, and I do not wish to express thanks, but I have received undeserved benefits, and my heart is filled with trepidation, which cannot be expressed in words. I am hereby offering my accumulated savings of ninety-five yuan to be used as medical aid funds. This small amount is not enough to repay even a tenth of the aid I have received, but it represents a sincere heart, to ease my conscience. Furthermore, Dr. Song Guobin's careful treatment has revived me from a serious illness, and his kindness is like being reborn."</p>
<h3>Continued Condolences for Su Yizhi from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, a parent of a student, letters continue to arrive from all sectors expressing indignation. They believe that Liu Wangshi relied on her power to bully others and beat them to death, making her a social outcast. They demand that the authorities conduct a thorough and impartial investigation to redress the injustice and appease public anger. Yesterday, we received donations of one hundred yuan from Mr. Wang Zhengding of China Pharmaceutical Company, thirty yuan from all faculty and staff of the Shanghai Municipal Jiwang Elementary School, and ten yuan from Chengquan Company, which will all be forwarded to the family of the deceased.</p>
<h3>Wuguang Drama Society Performance</h3>
<p>The Wuguang Drama Society, organized by students of Wuguang Girls' High School at 210 Gordon Road, was established three years ago and performed once at the Lapei Theatre the year before last. This time, to raise tuition loans for poor students, they will perform two plays at the Russian Theatre on Foch Road on June 8th. The plays are "Ward No. 5," "Dragon Boat Festival," and "Mother Returns."</p>
<h3>Senior Welfare Forum (4)</h3>
<p>(4) Mr. Zhu Juefo shared his views on the words "emotion" and "reason" from the perspectives of young people and old people. Finally, he said that Zeng Wenzhenggong once said: The first requirement for those in high positions is to know people and be aware of things. Zhang Liang of the Han Dynasty said: Only by knowing people can one accomplish things. Therefore, today's Jiangxue Society specializes in human affairs and the art of mind reading. The loyalty, treachery, goodness, and evil of all people can be identified through techniques. If there are heroes who study and work, it must start today. As you sow, so shall you reap. Today is the day of sowing melons.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Zhu Xianrui, who recently came to Shanghai from North China, reported on the disaster situation in North China, where the lives of the elderly are particularly painful and urgently need relief. Finally, the chairman stood up and made a conclusion, roughly stating:</p>
<p>Today, I am very grateful to all the elderly gentlemen who came to attend this forum despite their busy schedules and shared many profound insights. People in our country have a misconception that once they pass the age of forty or fifty, they are old and useless. In fact, after forty, life is at a time when experience is rich and work efficiency is increasing, making it a great time for doing things, and the golden age for entrepreneurs, politicians, and scientists. Therefore, foreigners have a saying: "Life begins at forty," which means that a career only begins at forty. Our country also has the saying "Old but vigorous." The three elders of Shanghai Lankang Li are all old, but they are leading young people and benefiting society, not diminishing their ambitions because of age, which is commendable and worthy of being a model for the general public. In addition to launching the 100,000 yuan senior aid campaign, this newspaper hopes that there will be an organization for the elders of Shanghai to ensure that the spirit of benefiting the elderly will last forever, and to serve as a driving force for expanding the movement to help and care for the elderly in the future.</p>
<p>After the speech, all those present jointly congratulated the two elders, Shen Xinqing and Gao Fengchi, on their eightieth birthdays, and resolved to initiate the organization of a Senior Association. The mailing address is the Confucius Society, and Zhu Juefo, Sha Pengyuan, Zhao Ximing, and Sun Houzai were elected as preparatory committee members. It was also decided to hold the first preparatory meeting on June 6. (Jia Shui) (The End)</p>
