<p>社評</p>
<h3>現代學生修學救國之途</h3>
<p>最近中央大學發生學生控吿校長事件，據報章記載，政府當局對校長辭職，業已照准，而學風亦應加以整頓。此次事件，電訉所傳，略焉不詳，無從評述。惟發生於中央最高學府，無論責在何方，畢竟是足以遺憾的事。我們感於敎育事業，，爲建設國家，復興國家最基本的任務，以我國敎育的不普及，人民知識水準的落後，貧弱之因，半由於此。我們將如何籌措敎育經費，興辦敎育事業，普及國民敎育，百尺竿頭，急起直追。此種艱巨責任，不僅應由政府負責統籌，領導推進，每個國民，都應瞭解其重要性。所謂敎育事業，並不限於學校敎育，一切社會敎育，民衆敎育，不包括之。而近來政府倡導之新國民運動，亦含寓國民敎育之意義，我自當接受力行。蓋一切施敎與受敎，絕非國民之義務，而爲國民之責任。有敎育之機會，而不知接受，習於酣嬉，不知上進，智能閉塞，甘爲庸愚，期爲現代之國民，其可得乎？期爲現代之國家，其可得乎？</p>
<p>進一步言，今日能在中學大學受敎育之靑年學生，佔國民人數中之極少數。我們一體視爲將來國家的柱石，對之期望特別殷切。我們更盼望此輩靑年學生，亦應不甘自卑的以未來國家柱石自期，而埋頭於學業上之功夫。最緊要者，這個「國家柱石」，幷不是僥倖輕易的榮譽，而自負不凡；將是一副千鈞的擔子，必須挺身肩荷。因此，將來如何得能肩荷這「國家柱石」的擔子，就須在今日磨練成必要的力量。每一個在學靑年，必須把每一種課業收穫最高水準的成績。天賦高者，更加悉心精研，在學理上深窺堂奧，則可靑出於藍。天資低者，尤須孜孜兀兀，不輟不倦，以達篤實致用之境。如此好學勤業，今後國家復興建設，需材正殷，何愁學無用處？惟有眞才實學者，才眞爲國家之柱石；惟有學無所長者，才會到處碰壁。嘗聞畢業即失業者，或因目前社會組織病態下一時之現象，但將來事實，決不如此。所應反躬自問者，畢業之輩，究竟對於所學，是否收穫水準以上之成績？是否已達篤實致用之境？如徒有畢業之名，而無畢業之實，徒有炫人之學歷與文憑，而無實際之學問，此乃靑年自己放棄國家柱石之責任，旣非敎育之過，又非社會之過了。</p>
<p>我們立身處世，每遇橫逆，每遇困厄，不能惟諉命運，徒責環境，允須有罪已精神。處理一切事物，由於自己主宰責任者居十之八。成功固爲應付得當，失敗即是應付失宜。時時反省，時時責己。譬如求職，有某處公開招考機會，所列條件，我所具備，所舉考題，我所已學，但因我往日之懈忽學業，雖學而未透澈，未務實，結果不及同儕而失敗。至此文憑與學歷已不能應騐，惟有眞學，可以取勝。更足證明並非敎育與社會之過。苟我往日能勤精所學，對於所舉考題，從容應付，游刃有餘。其結果必致成功。準此而言，失敗者，絕不能諉過於畢業即失業，必須深切反省，深自罪責，自不努力，與人無允。機會者，隨時隨地而有，惟像駿馬馳騁，不稍立待，但憑我們的能耐如何，苟能頃刻抓住，即可一躍而上，否則眼睜睜蹓躂過去了。得失關鍵，的在乎此。</p>
<p>我們所期望於大中學靑年學生者，旣爲未來的國家柱石，而要做國家柱石者，必須體騐責任重大勤奮力學。况當國家在對外參戰，千鈞一髮之時，能在課室中從容受敎，機會難得，尤須堅苦研求，絕不放鬆。對於課外生活，亦須實踐戰時意義，從刻苦嚴肅中出發。我們應該看作「餓其體膚勞其筋骨」的生活訓練的一部分，與勤修學業同樣重要。這裏略舉數則，以見一斑：</p>
<p>（一）剪除長髮，實行光頭。滿頭長髮，僅在修飾，一無實用，爬梳整理，塌油灑水，旣費時間，又化金錢，掠人而過，一股香氣，何益也？如懶於爬梳者，滿首蓬鬆，更不雅觀。靑年學生，在求學時代，言交際，不需要；言修飾愛美，更不需要。所以，實踐戰時力學生活，應首從剃長髮始。其决，女學生之燙髮，長髮，亦在修飾之列，同樣應予革除之。</p>
<p>（二）不穿西裝，不御華服，以整潔樸實爲主。西裝料貴，又須配以皮鞋；華服貴料，均非所宜。目前各校敎師，因家庭負担之重，均甚淸苦，挺秀衣服，無力購置。同學之中，亦多淸貧儉樸者，如我獨西裝革履，華服盛裝，不但炫耀同學，且對老師示威。故雖家境寬裕者，亦宜摒除西裝華服。一方面學校當局應制定男女學生簡素服裝式樣，以資一律。</p>
<p>（三）不穿皮鞋。穿皮鞋，常須擦油，光可鑒人，似乎過份，而現在皮料來源缺乏，價且高昂，靑年男女應多多步行，皮鞋消耗甚大，宜以橡膠鞋，布鞋代之。</p>
<p>我們姑舉以上三事，希望大中學的靑年學生諸君，不能視爲小節，應從此實踐，以爲刻苦嚴肅生活倡。我們也知現在大中學生中，很多家况淸苦，早已實行了上舉三事，可是，我們更盼望其普遍化。家長也應注意，敎育當局更須注意，蔚成簡素樸實之學風，而產生敦品好學之未來國家柱石，國家復興，庶幾有賴！</p>

<p>主席答詞</p>

<h3>褚外長款待保公使　席間觥籌交錯情緒融洽　保公使昨謁國父靈致敬</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　保公使呈遞國書畢，即於當日十時三十分由外部范幫辦徐科長等，引導駛赴中山陵園，恭謁國父靈寢致敬，並恭獻花圈。正午十二時褚外長又在外部大禮堂設筵歡宴公使，並邀國府各院部長官及外部高級官員作陪。席間褚外長及保公使互懇切致詞，觥籌交錯，情緒融洽，直至二時許保公使始離外部。茲將褚外長致詞及保公使答詞原文錄后：</p>
<h3>褚外長致詞</h3>
<p>公使閣下：貴公使奉貴國大君主陛下命令，爲駐中華民國特命全權公使於今晨覲見主席，呈遞國書，本部長茲代表政府設宴款待，以表歡迎，並藉此機會介紹閣下與政府諸位長官，及本部諸同寅會面，承蒙光臨，無任榮幸。溯自貴國民族於公元五六世紀歐洲各民族大移動時代南遷，七世紀在巴爾幹建立國家。貴國民族係出自東方塞爾柱突厥之一支，强毅沈　，原初聚族於中亞細亞方面，與我國雖甚遙遠，但中保兩國接觸歷史，始自唐代，至元代則兩國之契合，更見進展。貴國立國以農業爲主，牧業尤盛，國內地權分配，極爲平均，大地主無從產生，人民各得其所，對外來民族有吸收融化力量，各種宗敎並立不悖，開信仰自由之先河，在巴爾幹半島堪稱爲一模範之國家。今後之世界各國，必須互相扶助，始克共躋福利。現在威脅人類文明者，莫過於共禍，而助長赤燄者，則爲資本主義國家之國際侵略政策。我國民政府還都以來，對外政策，一秉國父遺敎，力求聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥。去年加入國際防共協定，本年對英美宣戰，此心此志，純基於抗拒公敵，以保衛東亞，冀對世界和平之事業，有所貢獻。貴國自參加軸心陣營，與德義諸友邦不斷努力建設歐洲新秩序，以奠定世界眞正和平之基礎。準此而言，貴我兩國之志趣，正不謀而合。此次貴國政府派閣下爲駐華全權公使，與我國初次樹立外交關係，將使貴我兩國人民心意結合，益形强化，而兩國間之友誼，必將因彼此所具之共同理想，而日益親密。貴公使職務上所需之一切便利，本部自當予以助力，俾能完成閣下崇高之使命。茲舉杯敬祝貴公使健康，並頌貴國政府進展，貴國國運昌隆。</p>
<h3>保公使答詞</h3>
<p>今日本公使承蒙貴部長設宴款待，並介紹貴國政府高級官員，實深榮感。今晨本公使覲見貴國主席，呈遞國書，此事將予本公使一眞切紀念，而永懷敬仰之忱。保加利亞自立國以來，雖距貴國甚遠。但對於接近中國之本國發祥地，則未敢疏忘。本國更可引以自豪者，即本國民族之血統與世界文化發源所之亞洲大陸民族，有親密之關係，此情已在本公使今晨覲見貴國主席時，於頌詞中表明矣。在此情形下，本公使奉本國大君主陛下之命，駐剳貴國，所負之崇高使命，實爲重修貴我兩國舊日之兄弟關係，此關係將因共同參加爲建設世界新秩序之正義義永久和平而作戰之軸心陣營，益形强化。本公使駐剳貴國之任務，頃蒙貴部長表示願以友好協助，快慰良深。本公使宣證，決盡最大努力，促進貴我兩國政府及兩國民族間直接之關係。並盼貴國政府，早日派遣使節，駐剳保京，本國亦將熱誠款待，俾使兩國友好關係，更形親密。本公使深望貴部長賜予可貴協助，得以充成所負之使命爲感。茲舉杯敬祝貴部長健康，貴國主席政躬康泰，貴國國運昌隆。</p>
<h3>保公使　歡宴外部人員</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　保新任駐華公使斐義浦　爲聯絡情感，特於昨日下午七時假國際俱樂部歡宴外交部文官處參軍處等之高級幹部人員。屆時到有部處長以下數十人。一時觥籌交錯，談笑風生，備極歡洽，於九時餘方散。</p>
<h3>茶會招待我各部院長官</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　保駐華公使斐義浦於昨日下午五時，假國際俱樂部，舉行茶會招待我國各部院長官，及各國外交使節。計到有各部院長官溫宗堯·江亢虎·陳春　。褚民誼。徐蘇中·周隆庠等，及日本尹東參事官。池田領事。德國古浦利總領事·義國比林齊尼武官·滿洲國張秘書等數十人。保公使殷勤招待，傾談盡歡情緒至爲熱烈。</p>
<h3>湘鄂方面繼續進行掃蕩戰　日系日谷少佐獲賜獎狀</h3>
<p>漢口七日中央社電　湘鄂方面渝軍此次在日軍之夏季進攻作戰中，又連續慘敗，共後即陷於彷徨失所之情况中。日軍爲澈底予以擊滅起見，即繼續在各地進行掃蕩戰。蓋渝軍第一二三及第一四二兩師之一部，的三千人，近因缺乏糧食，乃潛入宋河附近，欲掠奪該處糧秣。該方面日軍某部隊，即於本月二日夜，加以猛攻。截至七日止，渝軍屍二二二具，日軍截獲步槍五〇〇枝及手槍手溜彈及共他彈藥甚夥。又日軍另一部隊於近三日來，在黄梅附近，攻擊渝軍第五十六師所部的八百人。截至六日止，渝軍遺屍三八具，被俘八人，日軍截獲步槍手溜彈及其他彈藥極多。又中國方面石鼎新所部保安隊，亦在付桃鎭方面協日軍，於六月四日猛攻與渝軍千餘交戰，僅一小時，即在橫堤北方四公里之馬口附近，將渝軍擊潰，並截獲軍械彈藥極多。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日中國派遣軍系日谷步兵部隊及其配屬部隊，前於第二次長沙作戰中會建立偉勳，於去年四月廿七日由軍司令官授予獎狀。茲經上奏後七日下午四時由陸軍省發表該獎狀，大意謂陸軍少佐系日谷留吉所指揮之系日谷步兵部隊及其配屬部隊於第二次長沙作戰中，曾參加大賀部隊實施之第二次錦江作戰，對於達成擊破渝軍八十三師及新綱第十二師之目的，厥功甚偉。即該部隊於十二月廿五日配置於長野部隊左方第一錢進抵祥符觀河右岸一綫之渝軍主要陣地前方時，渝軍隔該河據守尖石岑一帶高地上之四週陣地，猛烈抵抗，故第一綫部隊方面之進攻，極少進展。於是系日谷部隊長於入夜以後，即乘霧雨敢然突入渝軍陣地之問，奪取尖石岑附近渝軍陣地要部。其後並繼續向西北方擴張戰果，以促進該處第一綫部隊之攻擊，因此大賀部隊之攻擊，頓見進展。至廿六日拂曉，率兵破渝軍主要陣地一帶。系日谷部隊繼又深入渝軍後方，廿六日晚復向對面嶺附近之渝軍堅陣敢行圍擊，將共佔領，使長野部隊之攻擊得順利進展，而使渝軍新編第十二師趨于潰減。該部隊繼于十二月卅日急襲渝軍一部隊而包圍之，獲得戰果。翌卅一日又先鋒部隊進抵湖城墟附近，發見渝軍第百八十三師部隊而急追，並再獲莫大戰果，使該師完全陷于混亂，並策應大賀部隊使其順利進展。查該部隊長以卓越果斷之指導，部下將兵咸確信必勝，故勇戰奮鬥，克盡平素訓練之成果，而建拔羣之偉功，用特授與獎狀云。</p>
<h3>榮子恒中將　對記者團談話</h3>
<p>濟南七日中央社電　榮子恒中將，巳於六日通電全國，參加和運，願在汪主席領導之下，以完成保衛中華復興東亞之偉業。茲榮中將特於七日十時在此問山東賓館招待記者團，發表談話，說明此次參加和運之動機。大意謂：余參加和運之動機，一言以蔽之，在擁護孫總理之大亞洲主義，及汪主席之和平反共國策。良以友邦日本，已協助中國解除英美百年來加諸中國之桎梏，使中國民衆獲得解放。本年一月國府又對英美宣戰，即聲明與日本同生共死，余確保東亞必能藉此復興。一方面重慶今仍執迷不悟，高呼抗戰，但此徒利英美與共軍，而益增民衆痛苦。余目睹兩者動向之後，深知惟有和平始能救國，故毅然率部來歸，參加和運，願在在主席領導之下，以謀復興中國。最近英美雖曾與渝方締結供給物資協定，但此僅爲虛文。現渝方物資之不足，影響民衆思想者並深且巨。反觀國府還都三年以來，因獲得友邦日本之莫大援助，故在各方面，均已得驚人之發展。余今後願在在主席領導之下，率領所部，盡我軍人應盡之天職，以完成保衛東亞復興中華之偉業云。</p>
<h3>駐渝美機兩襲宜昌　均遭日軍擊落</h3>

<h3>冀東津海渤海一帶　日軍剿共戰果</h3>
<p>天津七日中央社電　冀東津海渤海一帶日軍，最近會在各地淸剿共軍，展開猛烈攻勢。如五月中旬，在冀東鐵南「京山錢南方」一役，即澈底擊破共軍之政治組織，及其根據地，而收穫莫大戰果。國府武裝團體，亦會協助日軍活動，建立殊勳，同時自國民政府宣布參戰以來，各地鄕村民衆，亦即）致崛起，協助日軍，維持治安。故目下冀東津海渤海三處，治安極爲鞏固。茲誌五月份日軍綜合戰果如次：交戰二十七次，圍剿九四八次，交戰共軍兵力四四〇〇人，擊毀共軍設施十二處，共軍遺屍二九二具，被俘二四七人，日軍奪獲重機槍一挺，子彈一百發，自動步槍一枝，子彈四二六發，步槍一五六枝，子彈四六〇四發，手槍五四枝，子彈六一三發，手溜彈六七〇枚，土砲一〇四門，及其他武器被服糧秣，甚夥。</p>

<h3>中國智識階級的困厄</h3>
<p>— 毋中忠夫</p>
<p>每一個都是這樣說：安定民生，是加强國府，促進和平的一法，我們把這個問題分開階級來看，對於中國智識階級的生活，尤允不得不深切關心。他們是中國民衆的中堅，是中國民衆的指導者，他們在過去相當活躍，其中也有閑階級，可是現在却不同了。</p>
<p>從前是某一門的專家，而有特殊安定地位的人，事變後還留在上海觀望形勢，可是新政府未予錄用，再加生活担子一天一一的加重，所以本來不是抗日的人，爲着生活艱苦，也有許多不辭跋涉，千里迢迢到重慶方面去的人，聽到這種消息的時候，我是不勝浩嘆。</p>
<p>這一次我到了　違已久的首都，見到許多中國的舊友，可是所過的人，都以生活問題爲談座，而且他們不厭繁複地頻頻訴說其本身的生活之苦。尤其因爲他們是和政治，經濟不甚接近的文化人，所以更叫人吃驚。</p>
<p>某一個人他這樣說：南京方面拉人力車的苦力，雖然有五十元一天的收入，可是除了十元車租，這四十元還不够夫婦兩口子的生活。我們身爲簡任階級，但是月入千數百元，那裏能够維持生活，保全體面呢？</p>
<p>還有一個人這樣說：一個印刷所的排字工人，叫他排一千字要四·五十元，可是智識階級絞盡了腦汁所寫的稿子，一千字也不過三十元左右，簡直及不上排字工人的報酬。</p>
<p>生活雖然如此艱苦，可是素重體而的智識階級，要像人力車夫一樣窮兇極惡的討價，這是做不出的。</p>
<p>生活困難，達於極點，服務於政府機關的人，有辦法到財界去的，都已去了。殘留的也在兼營買賣，往來於上海的人非常之多，就是到差，也是心不在意，念頭老是在俸給上打轉。所以一禮拜總要缺到一兩次，服務精神散漫，當然能率减退，而內心的不滿，也漸漸激化了。</p>
<p>中國智識階級的生活，決不是社會經濟問題，乃是戰時下之嚴重的政治問題，我願喚起中日雙方軍政民間，對中國智識階級的關心，適應決戰體制。解決此項問題，就是爲完成大東亞戰爭的一大課題。（雲鵬：譯自六月七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>菲島行政長官　發表告民眾書　務須與友邦作全面協力　向爭取獨立之大道邁進</h3>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　菲島行政長官伐爾加斯及行政府各部長官，曾於五日聯名發表吿菲島民衆書。茲錄其大意如次：「友邦日本已將菲人之運命，委之於吾菲人自己之手，此蓋爲使吾人獲得菲島前所未有之自山新時代中無比之特權，故此實爲罕有之事。因此凡吾菲人如有企圖逃避責任，企圖推却犧牡，則實爲吾全菲之奇恥。日本東條首相閣下前决蒞菲訪問時，曾以最嚴肅而眞摯之態度，於菲人羣衆前三度確認日本將准許菲島獨立之諾言。有謂若菲島民衆對於確立大東亞共榮圈而與日本積極全面協力，則日本將儘速准許菲島獨立云云。日本之以如此誠意與寬大之措置，將准許吾人獨立，此實爲菲島史是空前所未有者。菲島獨立一旦實現，則吾人在菲人之立塲及東亞人立塲上之威信，立即可吿恢復。因此吾人實應舉其全力，爲完遂大東亞戰爭而奮鬥，吾人應以物質精神兩方面之總力貢，獻於復興大業，並應抱高邁之希望，期待光榮之將來，凡吾菲人務須團結一致，向爭取菲島獨立之光榮大道邁進。</p>

<h3>傳馬歇爾將軍在北非　作侵犯歐陸之準備　邱吉爾返英後召開二次閣議　反軸心國神經戰現達於頂點</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央電　海通社息：倫敦各報紙於邱吉爾首相返國後，皆以反軸心進攻歐陸爲標題，紛紛加以討論。「每日導報」謂自軍事方面探來消息，現在阿爾及爾之美參謀總長馬歇爾將軍將自北非方面開始進攻歐陸。衆信反軸心最高指揮即將改組，馬歇爾將在地中海區域內統率全部反軸心軍。此外另一英國將領將準備一切直接淮襲北歐。「每日快報」亦認馬歇爾之在阿爾及爾含有重要性。「泰晤士報」則深信反軸心軍必能會問蘇聯，對歐洲作一決定性的襲擊。同時暗示在遠東方面亦將有所行動以救濟重慶。各報一致公認邱氏之返英，實爲攻歐之前驅，並信渠在下院之宣言，必極簡短而無辯論。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　邱吉爾首相返英後，英內閣於星期日又舉行第二次閣議，英軍高級領袖均列席，艾登外相在會議中，解釋其訪問阿爾及爾之經過，謂邱吉爾首和因將在該處作最重要之決定，故欲渠亦前往云。</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩七日中央社電　海通社訊，據瑞典每日新開報駐倫教訪員今晨電稱：「邱吉爾返抵偷敦後，反軸心國對軸心國之神經戰，已可謂達於頂點。惟反軸心國侵犯歐陸之日期及方向，則尙在不可知之數。英京消息靈通人士咸信英外相艾登曾奉邱吉雨之召，前往北非，因邱氏決定延期返英後，急欲儘早與其戰時內閣接觸也。又據「社會民主報」駐倫教訪員電稱，關於地中海之局勢，英國政界方面信該處之政治與軍事尙未有具體之決定。該方又信邱吉爾在北菲之盤桓，與艾登之訪問北菲，皆與特戈爾與季勞談判事有關，雖然官方則加以否認之。邱吉爾北菲之行，僅決定於華盛頓會議之後，蓋渠認有與北菲軍事領袖直接商談之必要，由此推測，協約國以前所商定之計劃，或有相當之改變。更有人認邱吉爾之訪問北菲，爲對協約國之軍事準備，作最後之視察。總之，倫敦之覜察者信邱吉爾最近在北菲之盤桓，對地中海將來之戰事，已有詳細之決定矣。</p>
<h3>土耳其共和人民黨　定今日舉行大會　伊斯美總統將闡明政策</h3>
<p>安加拉七日中央社電　海通社特派員史密茲宣稱：土耳其共和式民黨定星期二日在此舉行弟六屆全國大會土總統伊斯美將以該黨名譽會長之資格發表演說，此間政界人士咸認土總統之演說，在政治上含有特殊重大之意義，因科其將重申土耳其之中立政策也。按該黨全國大會之歷史，與土耳其共和國實有密切之連繫。故總統凱末爾之努力導使人民參加內政與外交各項事務之處理，實爲該大會曾思想之發源。當一九一九年九月四日在故總統凱末爾之領導下，舉行第一次大會時，曾　重宣言「保障安那托里亞權利聯盟」之成立，土耳其人民黨之誕生即基於此。五年後一九二四年時，該黨正式定名爲土耳其共和人民黨，並決定土耳其共和國改組之各項原則，同時更規定每四年召集大會一次。根據此項決議，第二次大會於一九二七年十月十五日舉行，當時凱末爾曾發表其具有歷史性之重要演說，連演至六個月之久，其演辭旋即印成「國民革命」一書，並已譯成世界各種主要文字。第三次大會係在一九二一年舉行，據土耳其政策史所載。此决會議之重要性，即爲國民革命所持國家政策之完成。以後復於一九三五年與一九三九年分別召集第四屆與第五屆大會。舉行第五屆大會時，因凱未爾業已逝世，故由伊斯美首决主席，蓋每次大會皆邀請各省代表參加，而其中多數並非議正。大會之決議案不得史改，政府即奉爲內政與外交之施政方針。六月八日舉行之第六屆大會，將由伊斯美總統第二次担任主席。</p>

<h3>瑞典總理宣稱　決心維護中立　瑞京熱烈慶祝陸軍節　大批後備兵徵召入伍</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩六日中央社電　瑞典總理韓森及外長古恩達，本日力言瑞典之決心保衛其中立政策。總理在都萊維克演講宣稱，戰爭愈趨猛烈，瑞典之危險亦愈增。渠云，「吾人態度之決定，乃由吾人之希望生存於和平之中，吾人軍事準備之目的，乃欲使吾人之希望被尊重，同時並保持吾人之自由與獨立。」總理又云，「對中立國地位之諒解已略有恢復，雙方交戰國所希冀者，唯　格之中立，因此吾所遵循之獨立政策，可獲眞正之成功」云。外長在斯坦維根演說闡述外交政策。據云，瑞典人民又有責瑞典未能使世界或其他斯堪的那維亞國家出於患難者，其實瑞典之政策，始終以中立爲原則，決不願利用地位以博取利益。瑞典之政策並不與其姊妹國之作戰有碍，且嘗儘量給與幫助。但瑞典雖有對他國之義務，然本身之利益自應首先顧及云。</p>
<p>德哥爾摩七日中央社電　瑞典昨日慶祝陸軍節，各團體在瑞京運動塲舉行大會，瑞典陸軍亦參加，國王及王室貴　多人亦參與。</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩七日中央社電　據海通社訊：此間無綫電昨日宣讀瑞軍總司令之命令，召集瑞典後備軍之大部份入伍。此輩被微召者將受去年冬季聞所決定之訓練課程。據云此舉與國外政局並無關係，數日前亦會有大批後備兵被微入伍</p>

<h3>英美責難西班牙中立</h3>
<p>（沮利希田口特派員一日電）據巴塞爾日報駐倫敦特派員指稱：最近英美對西班牙的態度顯趨惡化，其報吿如次</p>
<p>反軸心國對西班牙的公私論調，在二三週前，極爲友好而懇篤。自北非戰事吿終後，這態度起了急激的變化。例如西班牙提出要求英美空軍停止轟炸歐洲，英外相艾登，美戰時情報局長愛瑪台維斯在英國報紙上對此要求痛加反駁，稱：「西班牙當內亂時及英國受德空軍轟炸時，不是沒有表示過這樣人道的主張麼？到現在而掉弄這種好聽的言詞，不單是僞善者，而且西班牙業已變成軸心的工具了。」</p>
<p>英美錯信西班牙本身所取的方向而從其反面着想，西班牙雖想更進一步探取嚴正的中立態度，但英美的觀測恰巧相反，視西班牙爲軸心的與國，西班牙祇因爲內亂的瘡痍未復，故不參加戰爭。英美以小人之腹，度君子之心，這是轉變對西態度最顯著的一點。英國各報復提起西班牙派遣反蘇義勇軍靑色師團至東戰綫一事，指此爲西班牙不能嚴守中立的證明，其論調比前强硬。以前攻擊西班牙者祗限於左翼報紙，至本月一日，英國的每日雷訊報反西的態度亦見露骨，揭載一文題爲：「僞善動物鳄所視爲不能安心者。」同時，泰晤士報亦揭載關於空襲的記載，並附以耐人尋味的結論說：「反軸心國對西態度的變化，是否即係暗示英美在歐洲登陸地點的意外新事實呢？」和此有聯帶關係而僥有與趣者，盛傳反軸心軍在直布羅陀集結了打破開戰以來之紀錄的大量商船，尤以軍隊運輸船及上陸用舟艇的集結爲數更多。英首相邱吉爾且更在上月二十七二十八日，在直布羅陀與北非傀儡政權主席季勞特，特戈爾派的加托爾，北非反軸心軍司令官埃森霍華，副司令官亞歷山大，英第八軍司令官蒙高茂萊等在北非的反軸心軍首腦部會談的消息，亦甚匱塵上，凡此種種，如與英國對西態度的惡化對照起來，殊堪注目。（翔：譯自六月四日西部朝日新開）</p>
<h3>英美在歐登陸的可能性　德國陸軍機關志的推測</h3>
<p>（柏林特電三日發）　最近一期的德國陸軍機關刋物「陸軍雜誌」，就英美方面侵歐作戰的可能性撰論發表，其一是南歐登陸作戰，另一是挪威上陸作戰。先就第一的可能性而言：「美國視南歐　歐洲大陸之柔弱的腹部，容易攻取。英美今以突尼西亞爲根據地，可對歐洲取攻勢作戰。英美在南部地中海集結軍隊及軍需品，軸心方面所能加以妨害的程度極爲輕微，但北非與歐洲大陸有相當距離，軸心方面從過去　年來已獲得豐富的經騐，　其主要的困難，厥爲如何橫　地中海運輸軍隊及軍需品到達彼岸。軸心軍自埃及，利比亞，及突尼西亞撇退，在運輸上曾感到很大的困難，因同樣理由，英美方面的南歐上陸作戰將冒極大的危險。英美遠征軍或許能在南歐的某地登陸，但用以應付裝備訓練並皆優秀的軸心軍，將難操勝算。有人說，英美在西南歐登陸，牽制軸心方面的有力部隊，或許可削弱別的戰綫上的軸心軍，但軸心軍之整個的戰略地位，不致有很大的影饗」。</p>
<p>其次，關於挪威登陸作戰的可能性，論述如次：</p>
<p>去年八月的狄埃浦登陸戰，反軸心方面　隊因無法不被德方發見，故未能渡比較狹隘的英法海峽，而終吿完全失敗。同樣，反軸心方面艦隊不能迫近挪威。尤以德空軍偵察機，不絕地監視許英國與挪威之間的海面。敵方以爲挪威有極　的海岸綫，故有效的防備或許是不可能的，但挪威的全部海岸已建造了防禦陣地，以防衛挪威，毋須再有駐屯軍隊及裝置海岸砲的必要。挪威的全部港灣，主要　島嶼及主要陣地，防衛極周密，挪威海岸諸戰略地點的防備，與大西洋岸的防備同樣堅固。敵人或許能在挪威海岸的若干地點保衛若十立足點，並保持至相當時期，但將付出極大的代價。而且德國也未嘗不料到有這種事態的發生，正在確立迅速而有效果的對策。（翔譯：自六月四日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日德義協力殲敵　德情報部長談</h3>
<p>柏林特電二日發　德國外交部情報部長施密特，在二日的新聞會見席上，涉及海軍長官　尼資與朝日新聞社守山特派員會見之事，就日德二國之軍事的協力，聲述如次：</p>
<p>如寶尼資元帥與朝日記者會見時所述，德義與日本今後在軍事上愈將積極合作，以求戰勝，直至打倒敵人爲止。最近各方面說歐洲的戰爭進入守勢，而「歐洲要塞」這名詞的被使用，即指取守勢的意義。其實這是錯了。「歐洲要塞」的名詞，使用於此地不甚得當，德義今後並不消極的跼　於歐洲之內，日本也不是個別的在東亞作戰。歐洲是今後打倒敵人的積極的大戰爭之軍事根據地，是偉大的兵器庫，與日木協力，向殲滅共詞的敵人之途邁進。（翔：譯自六月四日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>「日本民族在東洋人當中，是最典型的東洋民族。在其抑制自已方面，靜的內向性如達到某種限度時，則如火山之爆發，脾氣一發作則不顧一切，視自已之生命輕於鴻毛，這就是日本人與其他東洋人不同的最大特徵。深入眞珍珠　，壯烈犧牲與英勇就義的日本大和魂之根源也就在於此」。……這是京大理學部敎授　井卓博士首先强調出來的日本民族性，六日於金　市日本學術振興會創立十週年紀念講演會上發表的「關於日本人遺傳的各種問題」，曾對中國人與日本人作過比較，民族性　遺傳因子影響者居多，更就國土，風土，歷史所形成的日本民族性之發展痕跡加以闡明。！井敎授曾强調戰鬥日本的精神宿於內在，「由遺傳學上所看到的日本民族性」之偉大，其內容如下：</p>
<p>凡生物中的遺傳形質，皆決是於遺傳因子，即遺傳。人類所能看見的全部身體及情神上之形質，不論其爲常態或病態，總是和這種遺傳子具有某種關係。對於人種和民族來說，由左右共命運之形質與遺傳構成者實不居少數。例如對於疾病的先天抵抗性，黑人對於黄　病幾乎沒有，至於結核病，則黑人與黄種人都比白種人抵抗力爲强。</p>
<p>這種差別在決定民族命運的要素上來脫，常然是極有意義的，但我這次所要提出的課題：系人種，民族間的精神素質之差別，由遺傳因子影響者居多，同時這一精神素質的差別而大大關係於民族的盛衰，正如現在的强大民族，在繼續其生死存在此一舉的大戰當中，比平常更可以看得淸楚。只是這種精神素質，氣質，情操等之類的東西，對於一個民族來說就稱作民族性，這受國土，風土，歷史等影響甚大。我們先就日本人與中國人的身體形質以及其國民性來討論一下，</p>
<p>日本人與中國人以前曾以湖南型的名詞來總稱兩方的血液型，在指紋方面的弓狀紋和甲種蹄狀紋，也比歐洲人少，而渦狀紋多，單眼皮者也居多數，身體上的遺傳素質也非常類似。在兩種民族的國民性上也有共同點。在一般的性情方面，都很謹愼而節制，溫和而能忍耐。這就是二者間的共同點。而這正與西洋人的外向性情絕對相反，這些差別和不同。是由於遺傳因子而決定者，且在日本人與中國人間的精神素質，自然也有其相當的不同點。日本人生來就很細心，而有易於衝動的感情，但由於內心的節制而把銜動在强烈地抑壓着。這是因爲我國土地狹小，地勢富於變化，四季有顯著的不同，而養成易於變動的感情，且造成一面忍受天災一面反抗的習性。國土是小而仄的地域，交通範圍受限制，這一點是用不着宣傳和詞費的。文學則像俳句那樣的節省言詞，繪畫則多省筆。技藝又使重作單純化。</p>
<p>與此相反的中國人，因爲是大陸故在地勢方面缺少變化，自然物也衆多，所以在感情上很少激變，動作速度遲緩，半面持續性強烈。建築和背景由於地大而僵成爲大規模的，言語也是如不用大聲叱咤則不生效果，形容也是如果不用誇張和過甚其詞的辦法則往往無用。產生這樣中日兩國民的氣節和文化的巨大差別者，這是因爲日本是島國，數千年來國民性非常單純，在思想感情方面也並不複雜；與此相反。中國的民族盛衰轉移非常大，常常接受思想及習慣不同的統治者，且有時統轄異民族，或有時需要和異民族交易，以致形成中國的國民性。因此日本人的內向性與感激性是把原來者發展而成的；與此相反，中國人的內向性與感激性，是由於必要上的社交訓練而成，且善於宣傳，在文化方面也比日本形式上發達。這樣兩國人的不同，雖然都是同樣的東洋人，但中國比日本容易被西洋人瞭解，也容易被親近，總之，日本人的氣質，感情，習慣，文化，無一不是典型純潔的東洋式，而與此相反的中國，却類似西洋，至少具有易於被西洋人親近的要素。在這一點上，就是我認爲日本人是東洋人中最典型最純潔的東洋人是有力根據。日本人的氣質，如比作暴風雨下爽快散落的櫻花，則中國人的氣質就可以比作踐踏蹂　下生出嫩芽的百合花。</p>
<p>在日本的國土和歷史上自然成長和　　的日本民族之內向性，是强烈抑制着的內氣，如一旦爆發，則成爲恬靜的「視死如歸」的神性。這種內氣和捨身精神，是完全相近的，這一點也就是日本人和其他東洋人區別的最顯明特徵，大東亞戰爭的今天，這種精神就是每日振動着我們心坎勇敢將士之行勳的原動力。與這種捨身精神相通的內氣，即多年住慣日本的西洋人也很少理解，美國指導者由於不理解生成與發展於日本國土，風土，歷史中的日本民族性，以致造成日美戰爭。我很難用適當的字眼來形容前綫上奮鬥的那種勇士之內氣，那種壯烈的精神力，思念及此，我相信這種世界上絕無僅有的日本民族性之　秀性，是由於遺傳來的，這一點但就是我們學界應當硏究的主要課題。在學會上發表的道理也在此。（濤：譯自東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>阿根廷新政府　昨下令解散國會　外交政策似不致有何變更　各國對承認問題力持審愼</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　海通社電：阿根廷新政府已於今日將國會解散。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城日中央社電　阿根廷新政府之外交方針如何，此間五日各夜報均有議論。眞理報載稱，羅遜將軍特任之海軍大臣已向各國外交代表致送正式通牒，闡明阿國此次革命之經過及其動機與目的，此中並曾透露新政府外交方針之一端，即謂新政府將遵守美洲大陸連帶之精神及履行國際條約，以處理外交關係是也。又克里基加報載稱，據軍事會議密切方面人士談，新政府對於阿根廷政府所採維持中立之政策不欲加以變更，並決努力保持與美國及其他美洲各國之友好關係。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城七日中央社電　阿根廷新政府人選旣告完成，羅遜政府之內閣定於今午宣誓就職。衆料閣員就職後，外長馬蒂奈資即將召集外交團開會，俾可以新政府成立之消息正式通知之。阿根廷官塲人士雖皆抱樂觀，認爲新政府將不難發得外國之承認，但各外國政府似將採取一種靜待之政策，以觀察新政府之趨勢。拉丁美洲各國外交代表昨晚曾在智利大使加拉度之私邸中集會，商討應付此次政變之對策，據事後加氏透露，各使節已決定等待新政府之正式通知，然後再談判承認問題。因阿根延新政府已表現其完全控制全國軍民事務，阿國海軍現亦開始駛抵拉普萊泰港內，計已開到者有二七·七二〇噸戰鬥船「摩里諾」及「里伐達維亞」兩號，曁海洋艦隊所屬之全部巡洋艦，彼等均係服從羅遜將軍昨晚所發布之命令，由波爾吐貝爾格萊諾根據地駛至拉普萊泰靜候新政府之後令。目前阿根廷全國秩序均已恢復，據接近革命各領袖之人士談稱，新政府將儘可能範圍維持中立地位。同時警察當局已通吿京城各警署，謂現有共產黨份子準備散發傳單，闡明其在新局勢之立塲，如有發見即予逮捕。阿京自星期五日以來已吿安謐，是日唯一暴動事件，祗有羣衆之焚毀公共汽車。據官方公布，此次政變共計死二十七人傷十七人，大半皆孫在京城郊外作戰時傷亡者。民衆似已承認此次革命爲旣成事實，警察現均照常服務，但當局方面仍注意防範，雖在電力缺乏之今日，各街道及公共房屋均燈火明亮至日出。各報亦均登載此次政變之詳細經過。</p>
<h3>阿境日僑安全無恙</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　據日外務省所接公電稱：日駐阿根廷大使等日僑七千人，均安全無恙。目前在日阿關係上，並無任何變化。日外務省對新政權今後之政策頗爲重視。</p>
<h3>西班牙注意阿政變</h3>
<p>瑪德里六日中央社電　據西班牙首都方面宜稱，西班牙民衆現正密切注意阿根廷之事變，因阿國在歷史上與經濟上，與西班牙有密切之聯繫。但西班牙人仍保持其不捲入戰渦之決心。西班牙各報均以大號標題，發表阿根廷京城內突變之消息，但不加以評論。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊，德國政治報吿稱：邱吉爾回歐後，即前往阿爾及爾參加季勞及特戈爾之談判，結果特戈爾大獲勝利，易言之，即羅斯福失敗。但另一方面，阿根廷係英國之勢力範國，如今由美國操縱而發生政變，可見北非之局面及阿根廷之政變，乃羅邱之交換條件耳。</p>
<h3>東綫德空軍活躍　猛炸高爾基兵工廠　投炸彈千噸燒夷彈無數</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊，消息靈通人士透露之消息稱：德國長程轟炸機數百架，曾於五日夜再往轟炸高爾基城之蘇聯兵工廠，尤以莫洛托夫汽車廠爲主要目標，向之轟炸歷二小時之久。常德機距離該城一百五十公里之處，即望見上夜轟炸後所引起之大火尙在延燒中。德機連續二夜轟炸該城，投下炸彈的一千噸，燒夷彈不計其數，發生大火十五處。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊，德國負責方面宣佈：德機炸毀伏爾科夫河上之重要鐵路橋樑兩座，乃爲切斷列寗格勒前綫之供應綫。德機在伏爾科夫上游活動多日，卒將該兩橋炸毀，是役中被擊落之蘇機達十七架之多。</p>
<p>沮里希七日中央社電　東綫戰局之緊弛，向依氣候而轉移，然現雖値適於實行大作戰之季節，而東綫除庫彭地區及斯摩倫斯克北方之威里休地區有局部戰鬥外，全綫殆成平靜狀態。英標準晚報訊者布朗典曾滯留莫斯科十四閱月，最近　返抵倫敦。據其談稱，蘇軍動員現已達最高限度，蘇聯已計劃使一切有工作能力之男女，均從事軍需工業或服軍務。關於武器方面，據觀測蘇軍大體與德軍相等，然據過去之，經騐，蘇軍於作戰上雖積極學習戰術，然終不及德軍精悍，且空軍勢力亦極爲衰弱，蘇軍之飛機決不克與德施密特型機對抗。最後所應注意者，即蘇軍多少已自德軍方面獲得戰爭經騐，而德軍根據過去之經騐，亦得有幾多敎訓。又德軍當局就戰局之前途緘口不言，對美國方面宣傳德軍將出以防禦戰等亦不加批評，歐洲軍事消息方面對此頗爲注意。就最近英國某軍事評論家會謂，「今後左右東綫戰局之要術，並非某方欲展開攻擊與吾，乃在某方必須開始攻擊，其欲把握戰局之指導性並欲獲得有利地位者，當然開始攻擊也」云云，此亦殊堪注意。</p>
<h3>美眾院通過　取締罷工法案</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據海通社華盛頓消息：美國衆議院已以一八八票對八十七票，通過取締罷工法案。該法案規定罷工者至少在實行罷工之前三十日，將罷工之意通知當局。一般人皆認爲該法案，係對付礦工聯合會主席路易斯者。華盛頓政界指出該法案，係首次給與戰時勞工局以行政權限，該局以前僅遵照總統之訓示而行事。</p>

<h3>購買食油應由　二房東代表　按口分配各附戶</h3>

<h3>大同大學一瞥</h3>
<p>— 中央社</p>
<p>三十餘年來，從未曾發生罷課風潮的大同大學，創立於民國元年，而素以學風儉樸及數理學科所著名，在校訓「明德新民止於至善」下的敎職員學生們，總是努力於本位工作，因此，數十年如一日，維持着學校的尊嚴作風，現在的大同大學，共分四院，是文學院理學院商學院工學院，文學院內分文學系　地政治系竹學系，理學院內分數學系物理學系化學系，商學院內分經濟系銀行茶會計系工商管理系，工學院內分土木工程系，電機工程系化學工程系，共有學生一千三百七十人，儀器設備未受戰事影響，尙稱完善，如物理化學電工等實騐，均照常舉行，圖書以供學生課外參考爲主，以中日文居多數。</p>
<p>胡敦復校長還兼任敎務長，是一位不尙空談的實踐主義者，從他一身樸實的衣服，可以知道其爲人之一斑，記者在敎師節前一天，一個偶然的宴會中，分與他作過半小時的暢談，我們的話題，由女敎師被辱憤死案及十六歲靑年謀殺案談到敎育的失敗，辦敎育者應該警惕一下，胡校長希望今後辦敎育者，切實注重培植靑年後，曾談及敎職員的生活問題，大同大學足以自豪者，是有三十餘年的老敎員，多數敎職員的服務，都有十年以上的歷史，敎職員的待遇，在物價高漲下，當然是勉强度活，但他們的淸苦生活，是爲了敎員，在堅苦中奮鬥，精神是似得欽佩。</p>
<p>最末，講到學生生活，在寸金地的上海，辦敎育者每忽略了體育，這是環境使然，大同大學的體育設備不完善，學生體育當然是不會發達，然而他們却孜孜不倦注重學術的硏究，學生們自己組織了各科學術研究會，每週舉行研究討論會，誠然，他們是爲讀書而讀書呀！</p>
<h3>世界紅卍字會　開始收容流民工作　已收容流民九十二名　組織醫務處檢騐身體</h3>
<p>世界紅卍字會經辦上海流民習勤所執行委員會。於上月通知三市政機關分期收集流民，送所敎養；並積極布置漕河涇所內衛生各種設備，已由紅卍字會派醫師一人，女看護二人，藥劑師一人，前往組織醫務處。茲聞法捕房於上月三十一日送去流民九十二名，內男性八十九名，女性三名，計江蘇籍五十八名，浙江籍二十一名，安徽籍三名，廣東籍二名，湖南籍一名，湖北籍二名，福建籍一名，河北籍三名，山東籍一名，已由該所派醫師檢騐身體，予以收容，分派勞作，並經該所訓育股長張廷棟，規定授課及精神談話時問，實行訓練一切，秩序尙佳。茲將該所收容流民姓名年齡籍貫錄后：</p>
<h3>保甲青年部　舉行敬師運動　下月中旬起至暑假爲止　舉辦演講競賽公開辯論</h3>
<p>公共租界保甲靑年部，以最近女敎員蘇益之被辱憤死，實爲目前學校敎育之一不幸現象。茲該部爲欲改革蔑視師長之學風起見，特定於下月中旬起至各校暑假結束期間，舉行敬師運動。</p>
<p>公開辯論敬師問題</p>
<p>保甲靑年部對於是項運動，業已籌備多日，將於靜安寺路西僑靑年會及呼號XGOI等電台演說，並舉行獲獎競賽；同時或將假大光明戲院，對於敬師問題，加以公開辯諭，並將邀請各校敎師及其他敎育人員參加。</p>
<p>敎員薪金不如僕歐</p>
<p>同時又據泰晤士報記者獲悉，目前敎員薪金，均甚低微，事實上反不及普通僕歐或女招待。查一般敎員，平均每週任敎六十鐘點，而薪金至多不過五百元，殊不足維持個人生活。故一部敎員多兼家庭敎職，聊以糊口云。</p>

<h3>防疫委員會發表　三年以來防疫效果　以傷寒死亡率爲最高　今年應加緊實行預防</h3>
<p>本年度華中區域之防疫運動，因經華中防疫委員會統一注射方法及簽發防疫證書手續，成績較之以往大有進步，而上海向以地狹人稠，時疫易於蔓延，幸經市區及兩租界當局聯合防範，數年來情形屢有改善，今年之注射運動，從速發起，注射霍亂預防針者數已近一百萬人，猶望尙未注射之市民，於最短期內，注射防疫針，防霍亂以外，當局對於傷寒赤痢及天花等病魔，亦將予以澈底之消滅。</p>
<p>防疫三年已收實效</p>
<p>上海防疫委員會頃即根據上述之意義，發表對於防疫工作調查之結果，今年一月至五月間之傳染病患者，共計一〇〇六名，查民國二十九年同時期內爲三一三一名，三十年同時間內爲二二二八名，三十一年同時間內爲二四四一名，故今年較二十九年减少三分之二，較去年减少半數，此爲三年來防疫之實效，而「傳染病之上海」之惡各可從此消除。</p>
<p>傷害預防必須注意</p>
<p>又據上海防疫委員會發表，本年一月至五月，傳染病患者一〇〇六名中，病類如下：（括弧內者爲死亡人數）赤痢一〇五人（六二人），傷寒三七〇人（三〇〇人），腹窒扶斯一四人（二人），天花二四人（六人），痧疹一三一人，（十二人），猩紅熱三〇人（一人），白喉一四一人（四二人），流行性腦膜炎一九一人（六四人），觀於以上統計，可知傷寒之死亡率爲最高，故傷寒之預防注射，自有加緊實行之必要。</p>

<h3>法租界娛樂塲所　設置自警員</h3>
<p>法租界境內之戲院與遊藝塲內，自前日起，新設「自警員」一種，負責注意遊客之動作，與巡視塲內有無危險物品。按法租界保甲系之名稱，係「民警員」，該項新設之「自警員」，據云任務與使命，與民警員並無異樣。惟自警員係戲院與遊藝塲所雇用，並非隸屬於聯保辦事處。故其服務精神，與民警員異途同歸耳。</p>

<h3>張金海慘死案　昨晨開庭續審　承審推事途中被阻受辱　法院方面現正據理交涉　傳問證人米雷到案對質　庭諭改期定十四日再訊</h3>
<p>關於法捕房非刑逼供，致靑年張金海慘斃一案，本市第二特區地方法院對於一干華籍人犯昨晨再度開庭審訊。孰意法租界捕房中央區區長蒲歇戈，中途又發生毆辱推事王藍勝，是否企圖阻止該案審訊之進行，雖未確悉，但渺視中國法官，已屬無庸諱言，遂使開庭時間，爲之延擱達四十分鐘之久，全案審訊至中午十二時許，始吿退庭，下屆庭期指定爲六月十四日淸晨，屆時是否開始辯論，現尙未悉，茲將各情分誌於後：</p>
<p>捕房戒備法庭滿座</p>
<p>昨晨八時許，法租界薛華立路已開始戒備，東至呂班路，西至金神父路，北至馬斯南路辣斐德路口，均有法警駐守，對來往行人，均禁止通行，車輛幷遭阻止，無異實施局部封鎖，戒備綦嚴。時法庭內外旁聽席上，已座爲之滿，足微社會對於該案之關注，始終不懈。張氏家屬均準時到庭，張妻仍衣全身孝服。傳案四證人，均準時報到，在法警室內靜候開庭，法庭空氣，至爲嚴肅。</p>
<p>承審推事途中受辱</p>
<p>第二特區地方法院刑庭推事王藍勝，爲承詢張案法官之一，昨晨由其寓决徒步至法院，擬開庭審理，不意行至辣斐德路馬斯南路口時，突遭法捕房中央區區長蒲歇戈，禁阻通過，王推事當即出示官證，亦置諸不顧，遂生爭執，當塲將王推事之嗶嘰夾杉撕破，王推事爲保持法官尊嚴，遭此凌辱，卒未屈服，仍被通過，當將受辱經過，據實報吿院方，現正由該院向法捕房據理交涉中。查此舉是否爲蓄意企圖阻止張案審訊之進行，雖尙未明白揭露，但渺視中國法官，妨害公務，已屬不庸諱言。</p>
<p>首傳證人供述經過</p>
<p>因王推事被毆辱事件，遂使開庭時間爲之延緩達四十分鐘之久，刑庭庭長錢森首席檢察官沈文傑偕同推事王藍勝及主任書記官李定璠等，於九時四十五分升座公案，各原被兩造律師，斯時均正襟危坐，首由刑庭庭長錢森諭令傳提七被告，當由司法警察將郭士元等押入被吿欄內，次傳李秀英鄰人王錫慶到庭，據供：現年三十二歲，浦東人，業木匠，與李秀英係屬鄰居，二十九日上午李托吾至誠記襪店查詢有無獲得所失之洗衣票，即往該店詢問，店主張月波吾認此事，故即返家，轉吿李秀英，李又邀吾同至藝華洗衣店掛失票，行至中途，遇素識之六五二號巡捕，吾即邀同至洗衣店作保，及抵藝華洗衣店，據夥友云，已經被人領去，詰其何許樣人來領，據店夥云，係被一眼上有毛病形似學徒之人取去，故此請藝華店夥同至誠記襪店指認，該店主仍極力否認，故由李秀英報吿捕房，我即回家云云。又據六五二號巡捕吳福生稱：是日民人奉命出外催繳罰款，行經呂班路辣斐德路口，與王錫慶相遇，伊邀吾同至洗衣店掛失作保，吾因情面難却，故此同去，及至該店，據店員稱，已被形似學徒之人取去，故又與該店夥馮泉生同往誠記襪店指認，謂是彭雙龍前往領取後，但店主否認其事，故李報捕，派探調查，餘事不知。</p>
<p>米雷到案當庭對質</p>
<p>庭訊至此，乃傳元兇法籍巡官米雷到案對質，操法語，由翻譯代述。庭上當吿以傳訊係以證人資格，供述須說實語，米雷乃稱，李失票事，在四月廿九五時半解至偵探處，渠時前並未外出，僅在捕房另一房間內談話，初由一俄籍包探報吿，渠由華探四百十七號在澍訊問，郭士元來時，的六時許，謂係保其職員，過去並不認識，據郭云，曾識渠，至此乃提彭張至前對質，帶往小間，係由四百十七號華探在樹，事前並未注意，彭張曾吾毆打，渠進入小間時，正由四一七號將彭綁在櫈上，水是渠灌，並未打彭，彭放下後，張亦由在樹綁縛，渠與四三六號華探張桂卿再灌水，兩華探騎跨張彭下部，因綁縛未緊，恐其轉側躍起，米雷供會以拳摩擦張之肋部，釋縛後因見神色不好，乃灌以火酒，當施刑時，郭操法語吿以不承認拾取衣票，灌水郭未幫同，庭上詰以郭有云老闆已承認，爾等何以仍抵賴，米雷答，未聽見，供至此，華探汪樹要求發言云：三十日午後三時，騐屍時前米雷囑周翻譯告渠，禁語張金海被打情形，惟張頭部有傷則可云，張自己以頭撞牆所致，不信可請庭上傳周翻譯對證等語。</p>
<p>貝克利彭雙龍對質</p>
<p>繼傳證人貝克利，供三十歲，法人，爲中央捕房巡官員，李案由李鴻達等兩人任翻譯，供認曾施掌頰，吾認用拳脚毆打，後彭供衣在店樓，遂派朱松成去將張金海等帶至捕房，渠未予毆打，李與朱亦未予毆打，因張不承認，即送偵探處。錢庭長乃傳彭雙龍，詰其被誰毆打，供三人均施毆打掌頰拳擊，復將其摔倒地上，受刑不過，遂即屈招謂在店樓上，於是張金海亦被帶入捕房，除將張掌頰外，復有人以木棍擊張屁股，惟何人打張當時因神智不淸，已不能記憶，迨解至偵探處時，貝克利在後一路毆打。至偵探處被打後，郭亦予以掌頰，受形不過，張會答允賠償，但郭答以不能，非供認拾取不可等語云。</p>
<p>張汪兩探要求發言</p>
<p>法捕房華探張桂卿亦求發言，庭上允許後，張供，並未幫同毆打，進入小間，係受張月波囑託進內探視，此可由張證實。汪樹亦否認毆打，五月四日各報業已揭載，法當局命當日在塲人員，均作一報吿，渠據實作就報吿後，米雷會囑翻譯聽，甚表不滿，謂打死人由我負責，渠遂將原報吿撕去，另行換作一報吿等語。</p>
<p>米雷貝克再傳對質</p>
<p>至此，捕房律師許武芳要求米雷與貝克利兩人對質，庭上核准後，再傳米雷及貝克利兩人到案，問彭張兩人解至偵探處有無被毆情形，米雷謂無，僅見張頰紅赤，貝克利亦僅供認掌頰，否認其他非刑。李鴻逵·朱松成供詞與貝克利相同，但在樹供張彭有傷，曾報吿米雷，擬送醫院醫治，但爲米雷拒絕，謂不要緊。詰之米雷云，已記憶不淸，發覺張金海身死者，爲一號頭腦，當時張心口尙熱，遂送至廣慈醫院，孰意不及醫治，傷重而死，庭上再詰以郭士元曾云「老舉」一語，米雷答以未聽見。</p>
<p>傳訊證庭諭改期</p>
<p>未傳記襪衫店夥康萬青，供認李秀英購襪由渠經手，鈔票當面點淸，並無衣票夾入，後被帶至捕房，李鴻逵曾予掌頰及拳擊，當時神經受刺激，模糊不淸，迨郭士元至捕房後，與米雷談話，米雷面色殊不愉，乃將張拖至小間，郭亦跟去等語。協興號店主陳鵬理供認受王錫慶託，曾至誠記店內詢間有無拾獲衣票。李秀英父李銀生亦被傳到案，供認衣服係渠送去，計馬褲呢大衣二件，洗費四十八元，襯絨袍一件，二十元，共計六十八元，衣票耶交大女兒收執，藏於褥底內。庭上詰其失落家內，抑失落在外，何時知衣票失落，則供隔一日始悉衣票失去。據其女云，係購襪時失去云云。至此，已逾中午十二時許，乃宣吿退庭，改期至本月十四日再審。</p>

<h3>父親的話</h3>
<p>— 更生</p>
<p>賭博留給我一番創痛的歷史，囘想起來至今心頭猶隱隱作痛。它使我遭受過生命的危機，它使我走上了毀滅的道路。當我正深陷泥淖之中不克自拔的當兒，父親的突然歸來，救我於水深火熱之中。父親的一席話深深地感動了我，我戒除了賭博的惡嗜。我得救了。我永不會忘記父親的話。我謹迫記如下，以作紀念：</p>
<p>「孩子，兩個月的短短的時間，你是變了，不料變得如此地快，眞呌我難以相信！兩個月前，你是一個很有出息的孩子，我安心出門，把整個的家庭托付給你，我相信你，我愛你。但民孩子，短短的兩個月的辰光，賭把我的孩子毀了，我做夢也想不到啊！由於賭，你渾厚的天性是泯滅了，理智是喪失了，你一手扯破了以往的信譽，施用各種手段，去塡這無底的漏洞。你欺騙，你偷竊，當時你的腦中，只轉念如何弄錢，而不再有理智的存在。賭博使你變成了一隻野獸！孩子，我有五個孩子，最愛的是你，我對你最有厚望，但是，你使我失去了。使我如何地灰心！</p>
<p>爲了一家的生活，我離開了家庭。但是啊，僅僅兩個月的時間，你竟被賭博改變了你整個的人生！這幾年來，我命運多蹇，事業無成，常感覺事事不如人，當我自怨自艾的時候，我常自慰：我有一個好兒子，他已成年，天性忠厚，聰明能幹，心中千萬種不平也就消逝了。但是，囘到家裏，聽到你最近的一切，不但扯破了我對於你的夢想，過去僅有的自慰自解之念亦飛逝了。天下最傷心者，莫若使對之最有厚望者予以失望，現在，我身受了。你摧毀了我心中的憧憬，你使我負了債。</p>
<p>當日晚上，我雖路途勞頓，心身俱疲，但想到你的事，總不能坦然入夢。有一個時間是朦朧入睡了，但是，不久我又突然驚醒，你的事又滲入我的腦中。我茫茫然地想：不會的吧！我的孩子不會變得如此的吧？這或者只是一個可怕的惡夢。當時，腦中　起了一綫希望，希望證明它確是一個夢，於是掙開眼睛，靜靜地想，想日間的一切，但是，這證明了確是事實，是我兒子所做的事，我的心如爲蛇所噬，我感覺痛苦的窒息，我暗暗地哭了。</p>
<p>孩子！你年輕，見識少，閱歷淺。成千成萬被賭博毀滅的人，你所見尙少。幾曾見有嗜賭起家者？而賭塲老班職員却靠賭發財！賭塲榨盡了賭客的精血，害死了有爲的青年千千萬萬！雖然你也贏過，但是，這就好比借的債，明日，後日，或者一月，一年以後，你仍要去加利奉還！而終至一敗塗地，這是一定的道理。孩子，可以改了。用堅定的意志和毅力，從今不再踏入賭塲，你必能得救。</p>
<p>孩子，你還年輕，你還有遠大的前程。你願從今步入正途，戰戰兢兢，作一完人，重建起以往的信譽呢，或者甘心讓賭博害了你的一生？我不能見你走向毀滅之途，我要盡我的力量把你救出火坑！爲了賭，你雖債台高築，只要刻苦勤儉，總有清償時候，不數年後，復可還你自由，重再抬頭！但是，你得切記，不能再萌　本之念，否則，你必重蹈覆轍。你現在是負了一筆數目不小的債，爲了你的債務，我們大家吃苦幾年也是甘心的，只要能夠得囘我的孩子。爲了你，我願犧牲我所有的，只要能使你重歸正途，作一完人。今後，我們將極力刻苦，以期早日清償你的債務。孩子，我們的家將被你毀了，現在，我們應當重新建築起來。你聽話，幾年以後，或者不久的將來，新的家庭將重現在我們的前面，其時的快樂是無可形容的。但是，你若不以我的話爲然，仍以是地爲不足畏，復蹈覆轍，你必終身不救！當你再一失足而不能翻身，陷入深淵苦　之中，不克自拔的時候，你想到我今日的話，這時的悲痛悔恨也是可以想得到的。當時，或者我已經不在，或者你年已長，你雖想發奮改過，却已經遲了，你將抱恨終身。孩子，記住我的話，不要把懊悔再留給將來。</p>
<h3>思想·慾念·情感</h3>
<p>— 孟隼</p>
<p>慾念是想想與情感失去了平衡的一種突變：她可以使你感覺生命的飛　，如也可以敎你的性命不可。</p>
<p>發揮慾念最成功的「藝術」，乃莫過於賭博：她一下子將你帶上天堂——心花怒放，神氣十足；她一下子又將你打落地獄——愁用苦臉。懊悔無及。因此，慾念決不是容易對付的傢伙。她是寄存於「情」「理」之間的質性怪物而已。</p>
<p>情感却有其天賦的作用，它比慾念平靜些而較少爆炸性。它是內心之美的源泉；它更是培養人性底溫室：有了它，這纔使我們感到人與人間的喜悅，而自然發生一種共同進化的要求。</p>
<p>至於她存在兩性間的價值，那就永遠說不詳盡了。</p>
<p>戀愛故事之長新不老，甚之，坊間每年出版了幾千幾萬本書，祇爲在擋述兩性間的情感變化，從而顯示「羅曼司」底某種新型。即此一端，已足證實「情感」原是「無價之寶」了。</p>
<p>然而，問題必須還原於思想。祇有他能夠具有「修正情感」「審判慾念」的無上權威。</p>
<p>諺曰：「當怒火慾水正該沸時，明明知得，又明明犯着：知得是誰？犯着又是誰？此處能猛然轉念，邪寬使爲眞君子矣。」這是譬喻「情」「慾」交戰方酣，　非助於思想，而且讀給思想！所謂「轉念」！勝利；則人必滄爲邪魔的化身無疑。</p>
<p>因此，思想常是站在「情」與「慾」之間的仲裁地位及領導地位。</p>
<p>沒有經過思想訓練的情感，那是一種極原始的情感。正好像未得思想贊成的慾念，那簡直是「獸性行動」的別名一樣。</p>
<p>將思想深入於客觀事物的研究。</p>
<p>將慾念寄存於求科學知識的野心。</p>
<p>將情感連繫於受壓迫人羣的命運。</p>
<p>能如此，人將獲得生命本身的滿足。</p>
<h3>脾氣</h3>
<p>— 燕尾生</p>
<p>一個人脾氣的好壞，是可以直接影響到他與別人相處的關係的，同時也可以決定自己的成就如何。</p>
<p>所謂脾氣似乎只是外部的表現，但仔細一想當然得「有於中」方始能「形於外」，於是便可以明白脾氣暴戾的人，他的心地當然有了不滿意的地方，固然每個人有自己的個性，不過那些專門。是「欠得他多，還得他少」而要在別人身上發洩惡劣脾氣的人，大都是犯了「自私自利」的毛病，只顧到自己的舒服，從不設身處地爲別人着想。在家庭中固然是儼若暴君，無和愛可言。即使在外面他了是一個永遠孤單的人，因爲沒有人會長來受你的氣，你有惡劣的脾氣，別人難道就受得了嗎？</p>
<p>不過一個人如果毫無脾氣則也是無作爲的，因爲脾氣也可以代表一個人的「脾氣」，「忍耐」與「遷就」都是有限度的，如果凡事皆不聞不問，低聲下氣，被打了左耳光，再把右耳光凑過去的人，豈是大丈夫的本色。</p>
<p>所以脾氣當發就發，在平日與人們相處總該要有些「涵養」工夫，要沉得着氣，「已所不欲，勿施於人」，能夠予人方便也就是自己方便，好脾氣是包含「自制」意味泊，管束自己不使放縱是人生最要昆的工作。　　在事業上與人事上得到圓滿的成功的人如在些無謂的事上發脾氣確是得不償失的。</p>
<h3>日就嚴重之上海麻瘋問題</h3>
<p>— 汪怠</p>
<p>說者謂麻瘋蔓延，總在接近熱帶的地方，故在中國則以南方爲特盛。其實不然，即就上海一埠而言，二十年前很少聽到此種病症，據民國二十三年虹口及皮膚病院報告，在就診人中，發覺麻瘋病有二百起，及至最近，自利南路麻瘋療養院中，敢容較重的患者有一百數十人，日就診療所求治的，一天多似一天，據專家估計，至少當在二千人以上，尙有許多隱諱忌醫的，爲數當亦不少；這可以證明其蔓延的情形了！</p>
<p>麻瘋本是一種傳染病，雖不若肺癆病傳染之速，然而亦至可畏。在百雷博士著作中，舉出耐羅島（Island　Naurn）爲例，說當一九二〇年僅有四人，至一九二八年竟增到二百十八人，僅僅八年中間，有五十倍以上的級數增加，春傳染之速，實屬驚人。以此比例核算上海的增加速度，其情形亦至相仿而非常可怕了！</p>
<p>我上海人士，只知道注意肺病的傳染，郤沒有注意到麻瘋，果然，麻瘋不若肺病的顯露，假使我們一加注意的話，則在一般小販，車夫，工人，廚司，僕役中間，郤有不少身患麻瘋而仍舊混跡在人羣中工作著。這些人大都居住於潮濕汚機的貧民窟中，傳染力更加强大；就是普通社會中人，茍與他們發生接觸，亦不無傳染的可能。</p>
<p>上海是一個五方雜處的社會，人口又這樣稠寗，茍不加以防止，則星星之炎，可以燎原，後患將何堪設想！防止之道維何？其惟協助麻瘋救濟會擴充收容範圍，與普遍設立診療所兩大端。惟茲事體大，非羣　羣力不爲功，此次該會正因經費缺乏，舉行募捐運動，凡屬市民，爲社會服務計，以撲滅蔓延之毒燄幸甚！（不受酬）</p>
<h3>理解</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>我們對於任何學識，不論它是文學，或者是自然科學，醫學，—等等，探討和研究它的目的，不外乎是要求自己確切的去「理解」它。</p>
<p>學識上的「理解」，是幫助你創造事業的偉大的原動力，道德修養上的理解，是在使你懂得如何去做人？如何去確立你的人生！和如何去「修身齊家治國平天下？」</p>
<p>所以，一切的「理解，不一定會像你說的那般可貴吧！」那末，我就問你，假使，你病了，而請一個毫不「理解」醫學的人，或者一個毫不「理解」你病情的醫師，來給你治療，那末，你該得有如何的後果呢？</p>
<p>我說得更清楚一些，假使；一家兵工廠裏，招請來了一批木匠，或者石匠，而要叫他們去製造飛機和大砲，那末；他們該造出如何優秀的，的，足以殲滅敵人的武器呢？</p>
<p>當然；「學非所用」，就可以使一個有豐富學識的人，大嘆「英雄無用武之地」，而陷成同一個毫無學識培養的人一樣。</p>
<p>人和人之間，互不理解，那末，容易發生誤會和爭執，國與國之，缺乏理解，就會產生起種種的糾紛。</p>
<p>此外，一個不理解別人，也不理解自己的人，他往往會像盲人騎瞎馬一般的胡闖，結果，他一定會招致沒趣，利受盡一切失意的苦痛的。</p>
<p>人的生存在世界上，須要理解的事情，實在太多了，不過，先決問題，還須先要充分的理解你自己，眞同孫子兵法上說的：「知已知彼，百戰百勝。」一般，然後，盡你的力量，去探求其它一切你所需要理解的事情；或者學識。當然，你就決不會產生起什麼過高的，一時你所難以達到的慾望，那末，你也就永不會去嘗着一各人生的苦杯。</p>
<h3>幽默與譏諷</h3>
<p>— 寒風</p>
<p>在處世藝術中幽默是你所需要的，它並不是天賦的才能，人人都可以養成幽默的特性。每個人都應該把幽默訓練成一種個人的性格，它可以破除你的自負，自傲心，打消你的憂慮，憤慨；增進你的情感，友誼，更是人生健康上的補劑。</p>
<p>卡爾登曾說：「我時常覺得幽默是我們所吸取的空氣中的氧氣那一種東西，它創造而保持人類的歡笑，它固然還能創造出別的東西，但以歡笑爲最先，「人們需要的當然是歡樂的心境，有了愉快的心理，方產生愉快美滿的生活，才能去建立任何偉大的事業。</p>
<p>一句幽默的言語，眞好像密密陰雲中的一綫陽光，他可驅散一切的悲哀與恐懼的暗影：一句幽默的問答；更是消忿息怒的最大要素，可是，並非是辛辣的「譏諷」，榾謔而不虐的溫和之詼諧。</p>
<p>幽默被運用過於尖刻時，就成爲「譏諷」，「譏諷」最容易被運用，但也是最有害的。有時　果運用得適當，也可以增加歡笑，而不損友情，但很多譏諷中，含有惡意的。現在大都大利用幽默的錯處，就是祇以無禮之言語去譏笑他人，而不能使對方發笑。「譏諷」是友情上的大敵你雖則可以獲取勝利，但它決不能增進友誼。另一方面因爲這種失敗足最令人覺得刺骨難受之故，約翰遜博士曾經寫過一首短短的詩：</p>
<p>「一切使人窘困的痛苦，最難堪的冷潮熱譏：命運傷害一顆慷慨的心，不及蠢漢的侮辱更深。」</p>
<p>親愛的朋友們！切不要譏諷人家，也不要摸傲他人的神態，作爲取笑的材料，應該牢牢的記住，你是要保持友誼的。你應該運用眞情的幽默去砥礪你的朋友，利用坦然的幽默去處理一切的事務，使幽默變成一種强大之激勵而爲眞正的處世藝術。</p>

<h3>誰是包圍你的惡魔？</h3>
<p>— 子蕾</p>
<p>「朋友你有敵人嗎？」當我這樣問你的時候，或許你會覺得驚訝吧，「什麼？我有敵人？我的敵人是誰？」你心裏這樣想着，嘴裏凖會囘答我說：「沒有」，你甚至會更懇定的說：「一個也沒有」。</p>
<p>當眞一個也沒有嗎？哈哈，我得告訴你，可是你害怕，你已經被無數的惡魔包圍住了呢！這許多惡魔是誰？你自己猜猜看吧！</p>
<p>不相信我的話嗎？那麼請你靜靜的坐下來問問自己，你平日讀書專心嗎？研究學問有恒心嗎？告訴你，你的不勤不讀，不專心，沒有恒心，這都是你學問上的惡魔，你對待人謙虛嗎？你的態度和善嗎？你常幫助別人嗎？你是常常爲大眾設想的嗎？啊！你的驕傲，暴躁。你的沒有禮貌，自私自利，又是你的敵人，它們是你人格上的惡魔，還有嗎？有，還多着呢！你的不注重衛生，不運動豈不都是你身體上的敵人嗎？總而言之，你的敵人正是你自己，你自己也正便是你的敵人。</p>
<p>你可別小看了這些無形的敵人而滿不在乎的一笑置之，要知道你如果不趕緊去掃除他們，他們可要殺害你了，他們會使你失掉最寶貴的智識，最忠誠的朋友，它們更會使你從光明幸福的圈子裏，走向黑暗痛苦的路途上去，這是多麼可怕的敵人啊！它們有着殺人不見血的手段呢！</p>
<p>現在你的學問，你的人格，你的身體，都被這些惡魔包圍住了，難道你還沒有驚醒嗎？還不趕快爲自己解圍嗎？</p>
<p>醒醒吧！年青的朋友！認請了包圍你的惡魔，把他們驅逐出去，這是爲了你自己，同時也是爲了社會和國家！</p>
<p>我爲你祈禱，虔誠的祈禱，願你走上新生之路！</p>

<h3>小學敎師醫藥助金　知止居士慨捐一千元</h3>
<p>知止居士昨來函稱：「鄙人素來認爲社會間生活之最清苦者，莫如敎育人員與新聞從業員，亟應喚起社會人士之注意，協力籌集固定補助基金，謀澈底之調助，使從事於敎育新聞兩界人士，生活得有確切之保障。昨歲鄙人曾以某社名義，捐贈貴報八千元，撥充助學金，即指定儘先助與敎師及新聞從業員子弟之無力求學者，藉符鄙人蘊蓄於懷之願望，諒執事等當亦具此同感也。茲謹捐奉小學敎師醫藥助金一千元，即希察收。」（按款已開收，謝謝，並望各界奮起捐助。）</p>

<h3>請求各學校　節省一筆「畢業費」</h3>
<p>學期結束在即，又將有一大批的畢業生從學校裏出來，有的繼續升學，有的服務社會。同時又將出版一厚冊的畢業紀念刊舉行一次盛大的聚餐。這種事情，雖然並不是毫無意義，可是以目下物價而論，一期薄薄之紀念刊，非二三千元辨；而聚餐一次，每人亦非一百幾十不行；處此生活程度極度高昂的今日，大多數的家庭，何來此一筆額外支出。籌備經濟不成問題，只要看看華北的災情，　便覺得這種舉動太侈奢點了，況且這種舉動　無多大的意義。所花的代價並不值得，倒不如組織一級友會，日後藉此互相幫助，和　通訊息，而聚餐會也可改成茶話會，晝減少在吃上的花費，着重其內容和意義，故請求各學校當局制止，和學生自動節省這一筆無謂的「畢業費」！（一學生）</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>實物俸給</h3>
<p>我們讀中國經濟史，知鈔票起始於兩宋，即所謂交子。關子。會子者是。兩宋幣制紊亂，紙硬二幣，皆形膨脹，私鑄私印充斥，卒致物價騰踊，民不聊生，宋遂以亡。元代亦盛行交鈔與寶鈔，順帝時以國用匱乏，大發交鈔，亦致物價昂騰，海內大亂，軍需不給，郡縣皆行實物交易，民視鈔若紙，元亦遂亡。明代亦行寳鈔，嘉靖間鈔一貫不及銀三厘，膨脹程度，亦甚可驚，物價騰貴，民用實物交易，盜賊蠭起，明亦遂亡。</p>
<p>看了上列史實，可知當幣制紊亂之際，人民多行實物交易，於是薪給俸祿自亦多行實物制。明洪武九年即定親王歲供之數爲「米五萬石，…錦四十疋，苧絲三百匹，紗羅各百匹，絹五百匹，冬夏布各千匹，綿二千兩，鹽二百引，茶千斤，…馬料草月支五十匹。」可知實物俸給制早行於明初，而且其配給實物竟多至十餘種。</p>
<p>近年來戰亂相乘，紙幣盛行，物價飛漲，人民又多行實物交易，於是公務員及薪水階級之僅有紙鈔可領者苦矣。政府爲救濟其痛苦起見，已有實行實物俸給制之決議，惟共實施時日尙未見明令之公佈，似乎正在等待實業部與糧食部籌備工作之完成。</p>
<p>假使公務員能早日獲得實物俸給，則社會上之其他薪水階級，似亦有起而請求實物薪給之必要。</p>
<h3>各地貨物由當局疏通運滬</h3>
<p>本市各當局爲謀增厚物品有底，藉以穩定物價起見，對於華中華南及蘇浙皖等地貨物，暨土產原料，經積極設法疏通，頗收成效。昨悉，現今上述各地之貨物運滬者頗絡繹於途，大都屬於雜糧及工業上所需之原料，裨益本市工商業之拓展殊屬不尠，預料本市各種物品之供應籌碼益將激增。</p>
<p>嚴格監督買賣</p>
<p>據悉工商界人士咸爲協助當局復蘇商市起見，已决第採取下列各項步驟：計（一）遵照中央意旨，發起組設各該業同業公會。（二）訂定同業買賣業規，飭各會員同業一體遵行。（三籌立评價委員會，按期評訂標準物價，並訂定處罰辦法，同時派員調查，如有逮反情事，一律依章議處。（四）負責配給事宜，藉克杜絕囤積。（五）取締非法交易，規定概以現貨買賣爲限。</p>
<p>禁止流動交易</p>
<p>又訊自當局命令停止各業市塲買賣後，一般投機商人，及鳩形鵠面之掮客，不無受諸嚴重威脅，若輩在當局嚴格監視之下，平日行動深感的束，惟其居心叵測，竟敢流動交易，在各安靜馬路非法經營，茲悉當局對彼輩奸商，決將予以嚴厲之制裁，一經查獲此項交易，即將其拘獲，起訴法院，依法懲究，藉儆效尤，而安商市。</p>
<h3>蘇浙皖小麥豐收　統一收購配給　銀錢業聯合辦理小麥貸款</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖各地小麥業已登塲，因雨水調勻，均吿豐收。其收獲之佳，爲百年來所罕見。頃悉粉麥專業委員會，決定統一收購集中配給，並經中國交通金城上海中孚大陸浙興等銀行錢莊，聯合辦理小麥貸款由該會所屬之日本製粉聯合會及中國麵粉業聯合會與雜糧業聯合會小麥組等機關，分別劃定區域，向各產地，如蘇北徐州無灘浙東以及沿京滬滬杭兩路一帶收買，收得之小麥，配給上海·無鍚·鎭江·杭州等地製粉廠，如福新·阜豐·三興·東福·三菱·三井·廣豐等製粉原料之用。所以各地麵粉廠於小麥登塲後，即設法完全恢復開工。聞第一步先將所有粉車開齊，暫做常工班，然後再行恢復夜班，各廠依照今年小麥產額估計，則所製之粉，除足供華中各地正當需要外，尙有餘額運往華北救濟民食，並聞上海公共租界及法租界，以及市區之戶口麵粉，此後由統制麵粉之機關照以往辦法，撥交工部局糧食管理局等配給，以維民食。其配給之數量，決於可能範圍以內，酌予增多云。</p>
<h3>行莊認購糧券得向　中儲轉請承受　認額已逾一萬萬元</h3>
<p>自銀錢兩業同業公會通吿會員行莊認購民國三十一年甲種糧食庫券後，各行莊鑒於糧食庫券係爲政府購辦糧食之用，以所購儲之糧食爲保證，利息定爲四厘半，事關整個民食甚鉅，同時中央儲備銀行允遇各認購行莊，如有需要現金時，得轉向該行隨時照票面承受，藉裕週轉，並准認購時一次預扣利息，所以業已踴躍認購，將認定數額，分別函報中央金融檢查事務處，聞認購單位至少爲十萬元。或五十萬元一百萬元，及一百萬元以上總共已在一萬萬元以上，以各行莊所繳存款現金準備一部份爲範圍云。</p>
<h3>公共租界警察本部　聘經濟家演講</h3>

<p>大眾生活</p>
<h3>申莊司賬生活</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>「賬房先生」！這漂亮的名詞，在未經親列的人看來，是誰都艷羨而嚮往的。</p>
<p>然而，事實則不然，以下就是我爲申莊司賬的實際生活，你們看了，常爲晞噓而寒心吧！</p>
<p>我在一家中等的申莊裏任司賬，至今還沒有一年，月薪中儲劵六十元，供給膳宿，統計每月支出：洗衣·剃頭·沐浴共用去四十餘元，其他如襪子破碎，鞋子衣着，出外車資，又因我性之所好，晚上補習學費，每月積欠總在薪水加倍以上，那還是個人正正當當的用途，全無一絲一毫閒用在內。</p>
<p>所謂「水漲船高」。物價時時刻刻在上漲，而我們的薪水，老是停留在一定的限度內，　船被爛汚泥陷入深坑中一樣，要浮升也無法浮升。</p>
<p>要求增薪吧？老板總是以『生意淸淡』爲辭，不竟如願。眼看着店中各物自然的飛漲，老板「不費吹灰之力」地幾萬幾萬一次一次的賺進，而對於我們是絕對沒有關係的。</p>
<p>欲另思出路，又沒有較好的地方可去，於是這樣因循茍且的生活，一天一天的踏入愁困之路。家中的祖母病了！未婚妻出走了……一切的一切，我都視若無觀。</p>
<p>大文豪歌德曾說：「每一個靑年，對於他的現實，總是不滿的。」然而我們所要求的祗是生活的安定，目今的社會，對於我們這些許生活的要求，也不能滿足了！何怪社會盜竊和自殺之風，彌浸而日甚一日！</p>
<p>有人說：「世界是一刻不停的在前進着」。這些，還是進步？抑或退化？願賢明的社會人士，有以明白吿我！</p>
<h3>蛋業公會嚴禁　會員私運蛋類</h3>
<p>上海區蛋業同業公會，辦理統一收買配給蛋類，早經訂定章程業規，呈奉糧食部核准，並經通告自六月一日起實行統一收買配給蛋類。同業如有在內地辦成或裝運在途之蛋類，限六月一日起五日止，由該會照原貨成本價收買，逾期概作私進論。不料有會員國泰蛋行用國華廠名義，私運蛋類，計六月五日由蕪湖運來鷄蛋四十八簍，鴨蛋二簍，六日由當塗運來鷄蛋一百三十簍，鴨蛋四十一簍，七日又由當塗遝來鷄鴨蛋六十簍，爲公會得悉：令其將貨交公會，一面由會呈報糧食部駐滬辦事處核辦，聞公會方面尙須詳查事實，並召開理事會，商討此事，決定辦法云。</p>

<p>工商實况</p>
<h3>零頭布店之現況及其危機</h3>
<p>— 柔華</p>
<p>零頭布店在今日滬上布業中，形成一支巨流，頗佔布業中重要之地位，在法租界之「鄭家木橋」「朱家橋」「南洋橋」公共租界之「康腦脫路」「小沙渡路」一帶，零頭布店之開設，滿坑滿谷，眞是繁盛，溯其發軔之歷史，尙屬短暫，的在民九十年問，始有此種布店之出現，最初其營業之範圍與目的，本爲專承銷各染織廠，經整理機整理後之零頭布疋，包括「機頭剪刀口」「撥機油布」垃圾布等在內；故稱之謂零頭在店　其名實亦相符。查此種有店，組織簡單、資金薄弱，營業狹小，本非爲布業中所注意。至其開設，散布之區域，水在閘北之新閘橋大統路，三板廠新橋長安路一帶。嗣後法華民國路，繼之而起，至兩租界零布店眞是寥若晨星耳。惟以此種布店，因其所銷售布疋，係不成整疋之零頭，及揩油布剪刀口布垃圾布等，廠家視之爲副產品，最初向廠方購買，價格頗廉，出售承銷，殊易獲利。惟其能獲利，故此種布店，開　日多。而在自由經濟主義之下，自由競爭之結果，因零布店開設旣多，各零布店羣向廠方爭買零布，零布價格，因之騰貴，至此經營零布商人，得利日益微薄，零布店至此，遂有日暮窮途之勢。</p>
<p>惟自中。不幸事變發生，閘北之工廠區域，淪爲戰區，所有工廠，悉爲砲火所燬，其在滬西一帶，未受戰爭損毀之工廠，亦以種種關係，生產銳减。但是，戰後之上海，商業畸形繁榮。一般零布商人，復於「鄭家水橋」「朱家橋」「南洋橋」一帶，重振其舊業。而此時之零頭布店，且亦變其質，名雖稱爲零布店，其交易額實以疋頭布爲大宗，零布僅佔其决要之地位耳。考其名實，不甚相符，故亦稱之謖棉布號。</p>
<p>零布店三生有幸，値此大戰期問，幣値低落，物價　漲，凡百商業，均能獲利。布疋價値之上漲，倍於其他物價，資金薄弱東湊四搭之零布商，獲得巨利，零布商人，一躍上靑天。今日身世煊赫之零布商人，以是孕育成長，零布商人旣成爲戰時暴發戶之一，一般零布商人，本爲知識淺薄，奸狡取巧之所能獲利，於是得意忘形，任意揮霍，一擲千金，毫無吝色。然細考其內容，其脆弱性危機性頗大，第一：零布店有多數爲合夥組織，其合夥股束，多數即爲店內之職員，資力有限，其所繳股本，多係東移西借而來，自身毫無資力。第二：零布商人之一爲老板，或任經理協理之職，好像一登龍門，身價十倍，店開張後，即可獲巨利，以是任意作無謂之交際與揮霍，支出無度，浪費成習。第三：各零布店之貨物，驟視之，好像均甚充實，但細考其內容，多爲東拖西欠，借款貼票而來，祗須商業金融上，稍有風波，首先倒閉者，說不定即爲零布店，希望該業商人，善自珍重前途，以謀營業之正常發展。</p>

        <h1>1943.06.08</h1>
<h3>The Path of Modern Students to Study and Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Recently, a student accusation against the president occurred at National Central University. According to newspaper reports, the government has approved the president's resignation, and the academic atmosphere should also be rectified. The details of this incident, as transmitted by telegram, are brief and unclear, making it impossible to comment. However, the fact that it occurred at the highest institution of learning in the country is, no matter where the blame lies, ultimately regrettable. We feel that education is the most fundamental task for building and revitalizing the nation. The lack of widespread education and the backwardness of the people's knowledge level in our country are half the reason for our poverty and weakness. How will we raise educational funds, run educational enterprises, and popularize national education, striving to catch up from behind? This arduous responsibility should not only be the responsibility of the government to统籌, lead, and promote, but every citizen should understand its importance. The so-called education is not limited to school education, but includes all social education and mass education. Furthermore, the New Life Movement advocated by the government recently also contains the meaning of national education, which we should accept and implement. Because all teaching and receiving education is not only the obligation of citizens, but also the responsibility of citizens. Having the opportunity to receive education, but not knowing how to accept it, being accustomed to revelry and not knowing how to improve, being mentally blocked, and being willing to be mediocre, can this be the people of modern times? Can this be the country of modern times?</p>
<p>Furthermore, today, young students who can receive education in middle schools and universities account for a very small number of the national population. We view them all as the pillars of the country in the future and have particularly high expectations for them. We also hope that these young students will not resign themselves to mediocrity and aspire to be the pillars of the future country, and immerse themselves in their studies. Most importantly, this "pillar of the country" is not a lucky or easily obtained honor, but a self-assumed extraordinary task; it will be a heavy burden that must be shouldered. Therefore, to be able to shoulder the burden of this "pillar of the country" in the future, it is necessary to cultivate the necessary strength today. Every student in school must achieve the highest level of achievement in every course. Those with high talent should study and research even more carefully, and deeply explore the mysteries of academic theory, so that they can surpass their predecessors. Those with lower talent must work diligently and tirelessly to achieve a solid and practical state. If we study hard and work diligently, the country will need many talents for its future revitalization and construction. Why worry that learning is useless? Only those with real talent and practical learning are truly pillars of the country; only those who have no skills will run into walls everywhere. It has been said that graduates are unemployed, which may be a temporary phenomenon under the current morbid social organization, but the future reality will definitely not be the same. What we should ask ourselves is, have the graduates achieved above-average results in what they have learned? Have they reached a solid and practical state? If they only have the name of graduation, but not the substance of graduation, only dazzling academic qualifications and diplomas, but no practical knowledge, then the youth themselves have abandoned the responsibility of being a pillar of the country, which is neither the fault of education nor the fault of society.</p>
<p>When we live in this world, whenever we encounter adversity or hardship, we cannot blame fate or the environment, but must have a spirit of self-reflection. In handling all matters, our own responsibility accounts for eighty percent. Success is due to proper response, and failure is due to improper response. Reflect at all times, blame yourself at all times. For example, when applying for a job, if there is a public recruitment opportunity, the listed conditions are what I possess, and the exam questions are what I have learned, but because of my past negligence in studies, although I have learned but not thoroughly, and not practically, the result is that I fail compared to my peers. At this point, diplomas and academic qualifications cannot be validated, and only real learning can prevail. This further proves that it is not the fault of education or society. If I could have diligently studied what I have learned in the past, I would be able to answer the questions at ease and with ease. The result would surely be success. In this regard, failures cannot be blamed on graduation leading to unemployment, but must deeply reflect and blame themselves. If they do not work hard, they have nothing to do with others. Opportunities are available at all times and in all places, but like a swift horse galloping, it waits not for a moment, but depends on our ability. If we can seize it in an instant, we can jump on it, otherwise, we will watch it slip away. The key to gain and loss lies in this.</p>
<p>What we expect from young students in universities and middle schools is that they will be the future pillars of the country, and those who want to be pillars of the country must experience the great responsibility of diligent study. Moreover, when the country is at a critical moment of participating in a foreign war, it is a rare opportunity to be able to receive education calmly in the classroom, and we must study hard and never relax. Extracurricular life must also practice the meaning of wartime, starting from hard work and seriousness. We should see it as part of the "starving their bodies and straining their muscles and bones" lifestyle training, which is as important as studying diligently. Here are a few examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>(1) Cut off long hair and practice baldness. A head of long hair is only for decoration and has no practical use. Combing and tidying up, applying oil and water, is both time-consuming and costly. A gust of fragrance, what is the benefit? If you are lazy to comb, a head of disheveled hair is even more unsightly. Young students, in the age of schooling, talking about socializing is not necessary; talking about decorating and loving beauty is even less necessary. Therefore, to practice a wartime study life, one should start with shaving long hair. For female students, perms and long hair are also in the category of decoration and should be eliminated as well.</p>
<p>(2) Do not wear suits, do not wear fancy clothes, focus on neatness and simplicity. Suits are expensive and must be matched with leather shoes; fancy clothes are expensive, and neither is appropriate. Currently, teachers in various schools are very poor due to the heavy burden of their families, and they cannot afford to buy decent clothes. Among the students, there are also many who are poor and frugal. If I alone wear suits and leather shoes and dress in fancy clothes, it will not only show off to my classmates, but also demonstrate to the teachers. Therefore, even those from wealthy families should avoid suits and fancy clothes. On the one hand, the school authorities should formulate simple clothing styles for male and female students to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>(3) Do not wear leather shoes. Wearing leather shoes often requires polishing, making them so shiny that they can be used as mirrors, which seems excessive. Moreover, the source of leather is currently scarce and the price is high. Young men and women should walk more. Leather shoes consume a lot, so rubber shoes and cloth shoes should be used instead.</p>
<p>We will mention the above three things for now, hoping that you young students in universities and middle schools will not regard them as trivial matters, but should practice them to advocate a life of hard work and seriousness. We also know that many of the current university and middle school students are in poor families and have already implemented the above three things, but we hope that it will be universalized. Parents should also pay attention, and the education authorities must pay more attention, to cultivate a simple and practical academic atmosphere, and produce future national pillars who are ethical and studious, so that the country's revitalization can be relied upon!</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Entertains the Bulgarian Envoy, the Atmosphere is Harmonious During the Banquet, the Bulgarian Envoy Paid Respects at the Mausoleum of the Founding Father Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - After presenting his credentials, the Bulgarian Envoy, accompanied by Mr. Fan of the External Affairs Department and Section Chief Xu, drove to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 10:30 AM on the same day to pay respects to the Founding Father's Mausoleum and present a wreath. At 12:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu hosted a banquet for the Envoy in the Great Hall of the External Affairs Department, and invited ministers and senior officials of the various departments of the National Government to accompany him. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Chu and the Bulgarian Envoy exchanged cordial remarks, and the atmosphere was harmonious until the Bulgarian Envoy left the External Affairs Department at around 2:00 PM. The original text of Foreign Minister Chu's remarks and the Bulgarian Envoy's reply is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks</h3>
<p>Your Excellency the Envoy: Your Excellency the Envoy presented his credentials to the Chairman this morning as the Special Envoy Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Great Monarch of your country to the Republic of China. I, as the Minister, am hosting this banquet on behalf of the government to express our welcome, and to take this opportunity to introduce Your Excellency to the various ministers of the government and my colleagues in the Ministry. I am honored by your presence. Since the people of your country migrated south during the Great Migration of European peoples in the 5th and 6th centuries AD, and established a country in the Balkans in the 7th century. The people of your country are a branch of the Seljuk Turks from the East, who are strong and reserved. They originally gathered in the area of Central Asia. Although they are very far from our country, the history of contact between China and Bulgaria began in the Tang Dynasty, and the harmony between the two countries became more evident in the Yuan Dynasty. Your country is based on agriculture, and animal husbandry is particularly prosperous. The distribution of land rights in the country is very equal, and large landowners cannot be produced. The people get what they need, and they have the power to absorb and melt foreign nations. Various religions coexist without contradicting each other, opening up the precedent of freedom of belief. It can be called a model country in the Balkan Peninsula. In the future, all countries in the world must help each other to achieve welfare together. What threatens human civilization now is nothing more than communism, and what fuels the flames is the international aggression policy of capitalist countries. Since the return of our National Government, our foreign policy has been based on the teachings of the Founding Father, striving to unite the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together. Last year, we joined the International Anti-Communist Agreement, and this year we declared war on Britain and the United States. This heart and this will are purely based on resisting the common enemy, to protect East Asia, and to contribute to the cause of world peace. Since joining the Axis camp, your country has continuously worked with its allies, Germany and Italy, to build a new European order to lay the foundation for true world peace. In this regard, the aspirations of our two countries coincide. This time, your government has sent you as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China to establish diplomatic relations with our country for the first time, which will make the hearts and minds of the people of your two countries combine and become stronger, and the friendship between the two countries will become more intimate due to the common ideals that we have. I will do my best to provide all the convenience needed for Your Excellency's duties so that Your Excellency can complete your noble mission. I raise my glass to wish Your Excellency good health, and to praise the progress of your government and the prosperity of your country.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Envoy's Reply</h3>
<p>Today, I am deeply grateful for your Minister's banquet and introduction to the senior officials of your country's government. This morning, I had an audience with the Chairman of your country and presented my credentials. This matter will give me a true memory, and I will always have respect for it. Since the founding of Bulgaria, although it is very far from your country. But it has never dared to forget the birthplace of this country, which is close to China. This country can be proud of is that the blood of this country's nation has a close relationship with the nation of the Asian continent, the source of world culture. This relationship has been stated in this Envoy's eulogy during this morning's audience with the Chairman of your country. Under these circumstances, this Envoy, by the order of His Majesty the Great Monarch of this country, stationed in your country, the noble mission he has taken is to repair the old brotherly relationship between your two countries. This relationship will be strengthened by the common participation in the Axis camp, which is fighting for justice and permanent peace for the construction of a new world order. This Envoy's mission stationed in your country has been expressed by your Minister, and I am delighted to have your friendly assistance. This Envoy declares that he will do his best to promote the direct relationship between the governments and nations of your two countries. I also hope that your government will send envoys to be stationed in Baoshan as soon as possible, and this country will also treat them with enthusiasm so that the friendly relations between the two countries will become more intimate. This Envoy deeply hopes that your Minister will give valuable assistance so that he can fulfill his mission. I raise my glass to wish your Minister good health, the Chairman of your country good health, and your country's national fortune prosperous.</p>

<h3>Sweeping Operations Continue in Hunan and Hubei Provinces, Major General Nitani Received a Certificate of Commendation</h3>
<p>Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Hunan and Hubei provinces has suffered successive defeats in the Japanese army's summer offensive operation. After the defeats, they were in a state of bewilderment and loss. In order to thoroughly destroy them, the Japanese army continued to carry out sweeping operations in various places. It is reported that 3,000 troops from parts of the 123rd and 142nd Divisions of the Chongqing army recently sneaked into the vicinity of Songhe due to lack of food, intending to loot the grain there. A certain unit of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the area on the night of the 2nd of this month. As of the 7th, 222 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, and the Japanese army intercepted 500 rifles, as well as pistols, grenades, and other ammunition. In addition, another unit of the Japanese army attacked 800 troops from the 56th Division of the Chongqing army in the vicinity of Huangmei in the past three days. As of the 6th, 38 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, and eight people were captured. The Japanese army intercepted a large number of rifles, grenades, and other ammunition. In addition, the security force under Shi Dingxin in China also assisted the Japanese army in the Futao Township area and launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army with more than 1,000 troops on June 4. In just one hour, they defeated the Chongqing army near Makou, four kilometers north of Hengdi, and intercepted a large number of military equipment and ammunition.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Nikani Infantry Unit and its assigned units of the Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Army established great achievements in the Second Changsha Operation. On April 27 of last year, they were awarded a certificate of commendation by the commander of the army. After the memorial was submitted, the Ministry of the Army announced the certificate of commendation at 4:00 PM on the 7th. The general idea is that the Nikani Infantry Unit and its assigned units commanded by Lieutenant General Nikani Ryukichi participated in the Second Jinjiang Operation implemented by the Ohga Unit in the Second Changsha Operation. They made great contributions to achieving the goal of defeating the 83rd Division of the Chongqing army and the newly organized 12th Division. That is, when the unit was deployed on December 25 to the first line on the left side of the Nagano Unit and advanced to the front of the main position of the Chongqing army on the right bank of the Xiangfu Guan River, the Chongqing army fiercely resisted the four-week position on the highlands around Jianshi Cen across the river. Therefore, there was little progress in the attack on the first line. Therefore, Lieutenant General Nikani, after nightfall, dared to break into the position of the Chongqing army in the mist and rain and seized the key parts of the Chongqing army's position near Jianshi Cen. After that, it continued to expand the results of the war to the northwest to promote the attack of the first-line unit there, so the attack of the Ohga Unit suddenly made progress. By the dawn of the 26th, the troops broke through the main position of the Chongqing army. The Nikani Unit then penetrated deep into the rear of the Chongqing army, and on the evening of the 26th, it dared to surround and attack the strong position of the Chongqing army near the opposite ridge, and occupied it, making the attack of the Nagano Unit progress smoothly, and causing the newly formed 12th Division of the Chongqing army to tend to collapse. The unit then made a surprise attack on a unit of the Chongqing army on December 30 and surrounded it, achieving results. The next day, the vanguard unit advanced to the vicinity of Huchengxu, discovered the troops of the 183rd Division of the Chongqing army and pursued them urgently, and again achieved great results, causing the division to fall into complete chaos, and supported the Ohga Unit to make it progress smoothly. The unit commander, with outstanding and decisive guidance, and all the officers and soldiers under his command firmly believed that they would win, so they fought bravely and struggled to the best of their usual training, and established a great achievement. Therefore, the certificate of commendation is specially awarded.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng Talks to the Press Corps</h3>
<p>Jinan, 7th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng issued a nationwide telegram on the 6th, participating in the peace movement, willing to complete the great cause of defending China and revitalizing East Asia under the leadership of Chairman Wang. Lieutenant General Rong specially invited the press corps at the Shandong Hotel here at 10:00 AM on the 7th to make a speech, explaining the motivation for participating in the peace movement this time. The general idea is: The motive for my participation in the peace movement, in a nutshell, is to support Premier Sun's Great Asianism and Chairman Wang's national policy of peace and anti-communism. Because the friendly country of Japan has helped China to get rid of the shackles imposed on China by Britain and the United States for hundreds of years, so that the Chinese people can be liberated. In January of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, and stated that it would live and die with Japan. I am confident that East Asia will be able to revitalize through this. On the one hand, Chongqing is still obsessed with its ways, shouting to resist Japan, but this only benefits Britain and the United States and the communist army, and increases the suffering of the people. After witnessing the movements of the two, I deeply knew that only peace could save the country, so I resolutely led my troops to return and participate in the peace movement, willing to revitalize China under the leadership of the Chairman. Recently, although Britain and the United States have concluded an agreement with the Chongqing side to supply materials, this is only a formality. The shortage of materials in the current Chongqing side affects the people's thinking deeply and greatly. Looking back, since the return of the National Government for three years, due to the great assistance of the friendly country of Japan, it has achieved amazing development in all aspects. In the future, I am willing to lead my troops under the leadership of the Chairman and fulfill the duties that our soldiers should fulfill, so as to complete the great cause of defending East Asia and revitalizing China.</p>
<h3>American Planes Stationed in Chongqing Attacked Yichang Twice and Were Shot Down by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Hankou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing frequently sent out troops to carry out guerrilla warfare at the end of the Japanese army's summer offensive, but each time they were shot down by the Japanese army's ground artillery fire or captured.

<p>Tianjin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese forces in the Eastern Hebei, Tianjin-Haihe, and Bohai Bay areas have recently launched fierce offensives in various locations to suppress communist forces. For instance, in mid-May, during the "Jingshan-Qian Nanfang" campaign south of the railway in Eastern Hebei, they thoroughly crushed the communist political organizations and their bases, achieving significant victories. Armed groups of the Nationalist Government also assisted the Japanese forces in their operations, establishing distinguished service. Furthermore, since the National Government's declaration of war, villagers in various regions have risen up to assist the Japanese forces in maintaining public order. Consequently, the security situation in the three areas of Eastern Hebei, Tianjin-Haihe, and Bohai Bay is currently extremely stable. The following is a summary of the Japanese army's combat results for May: 27 engagements, 948 encirclement operations, 4,400 communist troops engaged, 12 communist facilities destroyed, 292 communist bodies recovered, 247 prisoners captured.

<h3>Graduation Ceremony Held by the Central Air Force Training Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The initial training of the first class of students at the Central Air Force Training Corps has been completed. A grand graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held at the school on the afternoon of the 8th. Lieutenant General Yao Xijiu, Director of the Aeronautical Affairs Department of the Military Affairs Commission, will personally preside over the ceremony. Military leaders from various departments of the National Government will also attend to observe the ceremony. This graduation marks the first class since the return of the capital to Nanjing. It is reported that their academic achievements are excellent. Since the return of the capital, our air force's build-up has made significant progress with the assistance of friendly nations. At this crucial juncture of the decisive battle, this group of new pilots serving in the new air force makes the future of our military build-up look even brighter.</p>
<h3>The Plight of China's Intellectual Class</h3>
<p>— By Wu Zhongzhongfu</p>
<p>Everyone says that stabilizing people's livelihoods is a way to strengthen the National Government and promote peace. However, looking at this issue from a class perspective, the lives of China's intellectual class are particularly worthy of deep concern. They are the backbone of the Chinese people and their guides. In the past, they were quite active, and some even belonged to the leisure class. However, things are different now.</p>
<p>In the past, experts in specific fields with a stable position remained in Shanghai to observe the situation after the incident. However, the new government did not employ them, and the burden of life became heavier every day. Therefore, even those who were not originally anti-Japanese had to travel thousands of miles to Chongqing for a living. When I heard this news, I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>This time, I went to the capital, which I had not visited for a long time, and met many old Chinese friends. However, everyone I met was talking about the problem of making a living. They repeatedly complained about their own hardships. It was particularly shocking because they were cultural figures who were not closely involved in politics and economics.</p>
<p>One person said this: "Although rickshaw pullers in Nanjing can earn 50 yuan a day, after deducting the 10 yuan rickshaw rental, the remaining 40 yuan is not enough for a couple to live on. We are senior officials, but with a monthly income of a few hundred yuan, how can we maintain our livelihood and preserve our dignity?"</p>
<p>Another person said this: "A typesetter in a printing shop is paid 40 or 50 yuan to typeset a thousand characters. However, an article written by an intellectual after racking their brains is only worth about 30 yuan per thousand characters, which is simply less than the remuneration of a typesetter."</p>
<p>Although life is so difficult, intellectuals, who value dignity, cannot haggle like rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Life has become so difficult that those who serve in government agencies have gone to the financial world if they have a way to do so. Those who remain are also engaged in side businesses, and many travel back and forth to Shanghai. Even when they are on duty, they are absent-minded and always thinking about their salaries. Therefore, they are absent from work once or twice a week. Their service spirit is lax, their efficiency has declined, and their internal dissatisfaction is gradually intensifying.</p>
<p>The life of China's intellectual class is not just a social and economic issue, but a serious political issue in wartime. I hope to arouse the concern of the military, government, and people of both China and Japan for the Chinese intellectual class and adapt to the decisive battle system. Solving this problem is a major task for completing the Greater East Asia War. (Translated by Yun Peng from the Continental New Report, June 7)</p>

<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Executive Commissioner Vargas and the ministers of the Executive Commission jointly issued a message to the Filipino people on the 5th. The main points are as follows: "The Allied Nation of Japan has entrusted the fate of the Filipinos to the Filipinos themselves. This is to give us unprecedented privileges in the new era of freedom, which is rare. Therefore, any Filipino who tries to evade responsibility or sacrifice is a disgrace to the entire Philippines. When Prime Minister Tojo of Japan visited the Philippines previously, he solemnly and sincerely reaffirmed the promise of Japan to grant independence to the Philippines three times before the Filipino people. It is said that if the Filipino people actively and fully cooperate with Japan to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan will grant independence to the Philippines as soon as possible. Japan's sincerity and generosity in granting us independence is unprecedented in Philippine history. Once Philippine independence is realized, our prestige in the Philippines and as Asians can be restored. Therefore, we must do our best to fight for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. We should contribute our total strength, both material and spiritual, to the reconstruction and look forward to a glorious future with high hopes. All Filipinos must unite and march towards the glorious road to Philippine independence."</p>

<h3>Rumor That General Marshall is Preparing to Invade Europe in North Africa, Churchill Convenes Two Cabinet Meetings After Returning to England, and the Anti-Axis Psychological Warfare Reaches its Peak</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: After Prime Minister Churchill returned to England, London newspapers discussed the anti-Axis offensive in Europe, with headlines. The "Daily Mail" said that according to military sources, General Marshall, the US Chief of Staff, who is now in Algiers, will launch an offensive in Europe from North Africa. It is believed that the highest command of the anti-Axis forces will soon be reorganized, and General Marshall will command all the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region. In addition, another British general will prepare everything for a direct attack on Northern Europe. The "Daily Express" also believes that Marshall's presence in Algiers is important. "The Times" is confident that the anti-Axis forces will meet with the Soviet Union and launch a decisive attack on Europe. At the same time, it implies that there will be action in the Far East to relieve Chongqing. The newspapers unanimously agree that Churchill's return to England is a prelude to the attack on Europe, and believe that his statement in the House of Commons will be very brief and without debate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - After Prime Minister Churchill returned to England, the British Cabinet held its second meeting on Sunday. Senior British military leaders were present. Foreign Secretary Eden explained the course of his visit to Algiers at the meeting, saying that Prime Minister Churchill would make the most important decisions there and wanted him to go.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: According to a telegram from the London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News" this morning, "After Churchill returned to London, the anti-Axis psychological warfare against the Axis powers has reached its peak. However, the date and direction of the anti-Axis invasion of Europe are still unknown. Well-informed sources in London believe that Foreign Secretary Eden went to North Africa at the call of Churchill because Churchill decided to postpone his return to England and urgently wanted to contact his wartime cabinet. According to a telegram from the London correspondent of the "Social Democratic Daily," regarding the situation in the Mediterranean, British political circles believe that there is no concrete decision on politics and military affairs there. They also believe that Churchill's stay in North Africa and Eden's visit to North Africa are related to the talks with Tegor and Giro, although officials deny this. Churchill's trip to North Africa was only decided after the Washington Conference, because he believed that it was necessary to discuss matters directly with the military leaders in North Africa. From this, it can be inferred that the plans previously agreed upon by the Allies may have changed considerably. Others believe that Churchill's visit to North Africa was to make a final inspection of the Allied military preparations. In short, observers in London believe that Churchill's recent stay in North Africa has led to a detailed decision on the future war in the Mediterranean."</p>
<h3>Turkish Republican People's Party Scheduled to Hold Congress Today, President Ismet to Elaborate on Policy</h3>
<p>Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter correspondent Smith stated: The Turkish Republican People's Party is scheduled to hold its sixth national congress here on Tuesday. President Ismet will deliver a speech in his capacity as honorary chairman of the party. Political figures here believe that the President's speech has special and significant political significance because Korqi will reiterate Turkey's policy of neutrality. Historically, the national congress of the party has been closely linked to the Republic of Turkey. Therefore, President Kemal's efforts to guide the people to participate in the handling of domestic and foreign affairs were the source of the congress's ideas. When the first congress was held on September 4, 1919, under the leadership of the late President Kemal, it solemnly declared the establishment of the "Alliance for the Protection of Anatolian Rights," and the birth of the Turkish People's Party was based on this. Five years later, in 1924, the party was officially named the Turkish Republican People's Party, and the principles for the reorganization of the Republic of Turkey were decided. At the same time, it was stipulated that a congress should be convened every four years. According to this resolution, the second congress was held on October 15, 1927. At that time, Kemal delivered his historically important speech, which lasted for six months. His speech was later printed into the book "National Revolution" and has been translated into various major languages ​​of the world. The third congress was held in 1921. According to the history of Turkish politics, the importance of this meeting was the completion of the national policy adopted by the National Revolution. Later, the fourth and fifth congresses were convened in 1935 and 1939, respectively. When the fifth congress was held, President Kemal had already passed away, so the meeting was chaired by President Ismet. Each congress invites representatives from various provinces to participate, and most of them are not parliamentarians. The resolutions of the congress cannot be altered, and the government regards them as the guidelines for domestic and foreign policy. The sixth congress, which will be held on June 8, will be chaired by President Ismet for the second time.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Hosts Italian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Turkish Foreign Minister hosted a luncheon for the Italian Ambassador Callegari on Sunday. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliament, Gogg, and senior officials from the Turkish Foreign Ministry and the Italian Embassy were also present.</p>
<h3>British and American Naval and Air Forces Attack Pantelleria Island, Various Parts of Italy Continue to Be Bombed</h3>
<p>Rome, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters issued a battle report on the 6th, stating that the Anti-Axis naval forces bombarded Pantelleria Island on the 6th and dispatched air forces to bomb it. The Anti-Axis air forces also bombed the Spezia naval port and various parts of the Cagliari province. The damage to the Italian side was slight. The Italian fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft gun units intercepted the Anti-Axis air forces on the 6th, shooting down four of them over Sardinia, four over Pantelleria Island, and two over Spezia. The Anti-Axis air forces also attacked the Italian-held islands in the Aegean Sea, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<h3>Swedish Prime Minister Declares Determination to Uphold Neutrality, Stockholm Celebrates Army Day, and a Large Number of Reservists are Conscripted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - Swedish Prime Minister Hansson and Foreign Minister Guanda reiterated today Sweden's determination to defend its neutral policy. The Prime Minister declared in a speech in Dulavik that as the war intensifies, Sweden's danger also increases. He said, "The determination of our attitude is based on our hope to survive in peace. The purpose of our military preparations is to ensure that our hope is respected and to maintain our freedom and independence at the same time." The Prime Minister also said, "The understanding of the status of neutral countries has been slightly restored. What both warring parties hope for is a strict neutrality. Therefore, the independent policy we are following can achieve true success." In a speech in Stanwegen, the Foreign Minister expounded on foreign policy. According to him, the Swedish people also blame Sweden for failing to help the world or other Scandinavian countries out of their difficulties. In fact, Sweden's policy has always been based on the principle of neutrality and is determined not to use its position to seek benefits. Sweden's policy does not hinder the operations of its sister countries and has tried its best to provide assistance. However, although Sweden has obligations to other countries, it should first consider its own interests.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - Sweden celebrated Army Day yesterday. Various groups held a meeting at the Stockholm sports field, and the Swedish Army also participated. The King and many members of the royal family also participated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuter, the local radio yesterday announced an order from the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, summoning most of the Swedish reserve army to enlist. Those who are summoned will receive the training course decided upon last winter. It is said that this measure has nothing to do with the political situation abroad. A large number of reservists were also conscripted a few days ago.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Criticism of Spanish Neutrality</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Mr. Taguchi in Zurich, 1st) According to the Basel Daily News' correspondent in London: Recently, Anglo-American attitudes toward Spain have shown a clear deterioration, as reported below.</p>
<p>Two or three weeks ago, the public and private rhetoric of the anti-Axis powers toward Spain was extremely friendly and earnest. Since the end of the North African campaign, this attitude has changed dramatically. For example, when Spain requested that Anglo-American air forces cease bombing Europe, British Foreign Secretary Eden and American wartime information chief Elmer Davis strongly refuted this request in British newspapers, saying: "When Spain was in civil war and Britain was being bombed by the German Air Force, did they not express such humanitarian views? Now, to trot out such fine-sounding words is not only hypocritical, but Spain has already become a tool of the Axis."</p>
<p>Anglo-American countries mistakenly trust the direction Spain has taken and think of it in reverse. Although Spain wants to take a more strict neutral stance, Anglo-American observations are exactly the opposite, viewing Spain as an ally of the Axis. Spain only does not participate in the war because the wounds of the civil war have not yet healed. The Anglo-American countries measure the heart of a gentleman with the belly of a petty man. This is the most significant point in the change of attitude towards Spain. British newspapers have repeatedly brought up the matter of Spain sending the Blue Division, a volunteer force against the Soviet Union, to the Eastern Front, pointing this out as proof that Spain cannot strictly adhere to neutrality, and their rhetoric is stronger than before. Previously, only left-wing newspapers attacked Spain, but on the first day of this month, the British Daily Mail's anti-Spanish attitude was also blatant, publishing an article titled: "Hypocritical Animals: What Crocodiles Consider Unsettling." At the same time, The Times also published a record of air raids, with a thought-provoking conclusion: "Does the change in the anti-Axis powers' attitude toward Spain imply an unexpected new reality regarding Anglo-American landing sites in Europe?" Related to this and fortunately interesting, it is rumored that the anti-Axis forces have gathered a large number of merchant ships in Gibraltar, breaking the record since the start of the war, especially the gathering of troop transport ships and landing craft is even more numerous. Furthermore, it is widely rumored that British Prime Minister Churchill, on the 27th and 28th of last month, met in Gibraltar with Jilot, chairman of the North African puppet regime, Gator of the Tegor faction, Eisenhower, commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, Alexander, deputy commander, and Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, at the headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa. All of these things, when contrasted with the deterioration of the British attitude toward Spain, are particularly noteworthy.

<h3>The Possibility of Anglo-American Landings in Europe: Speculation from the German Army Journal</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Berlin, 3rd) The latest issue of the German Army journal "Army Magazine" published an article on the possibility of Anglo-American operations to invade Europe, one being a landing operation in Southern Europe, and the other being a landing operation in Norway. Regarding the first possibility: "The United States views Southern Europe as the weak belly of the European continent, which is easy to capture. Anglo-American countries are now using Tunisia as a base to launch offensive operations against Europe. The Anglo-American countries are gathering troops and supplies in the Southern Mediterranean, and the extent to which the Axis can hinder this is extremely slight, but North Africa is a considerable distance from the European continent. The Axis has gained rich experience in the past year. The main difficulty lies in how to transport troops and supplies across the Mediterranean to the other side. The Axis forces retreated from Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, and experienced great difficulties in transportation. For the same reason, the Anglo-American landing operation in Southern Europe will be extremely dangerous. The Anglo-American expeditionary force may be able to land somewhere in Southern Europe, but it will be difficult to win against the well-equipped and trained Axis forces. Some say that an Anglo-American landing in Southwestern Europe, restraining the powerful Axis forces, may weaken the Axis forces on other fronts, but the overall strategic position of the Axis forces will not be greatly affected."</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the possibility of a landing operation in Norway, the article stated:</p>
<p>"During the Dieppe raid last August, the anti-Axis forces were unable to cross the relatively narrow English Channel without being discovered by the Germans, and ultimately failed completely. Similarly, the anti-Axis fleet cannot approach Norway. In particular, German Air Force reconnaissance planes constantly monitor the sea between Britain and Norway. The enemy thinks that Norway has an extremely long coastline, so effective defense may not be possible, but the entire coast of Norway has been built with defensive positions. To defend Norway, there is no need for garrison troops and coastal artillery. All of Norway's ports, major islands, and major positions are heavily defended. The defense of strategic locations on the Norwegian coast is as strong as the defenses on the Atlantic coast. The enemy may be able to secure a few footholds in some locations on the Norwegian coast, and maintain them for a considerable period of time, but will pay a great price. Moreover, Germany has not failed to anticipate such a situation, and is establishing rapid and effective countermeasures." (Translated by Sho from the June 4th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Japan, Germany, and Italy Cooperate to Annihilate the Enemy: Talk by the German Minister of Information</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Berlin, 2nd German Foreign Ministry Information Minister Schmidt, at a press conference on the 2nd, referring to the meeting between Naval Chief Dönitz and Asahi Shimbun correspondent Moriyama, stated the following regarding military cooperation between Japan and Germany:</p>
<p>As Marshal Dönitz stated at the meeting with the Asahi reporter, Germany, Italy, and Japan will cooperate more actively in military affairs in the future to achieve victory until the enemy is defeated. Recently, various parties have said that the war in Europe has entered a defensive phase, and the use of the term "Fortress Europe" implies a defensive meaning. In fact, this is wrong. The term "Fortress Europe" is not very appropriate for use here. Germany and Italy will not passively cower within Europe in the future, and Japan is not fighting alone in East Asia. Europe is a military base for a large and active war to defeat the enemy in the future. It is a great arsenal, cooperating with Japan to advance toward the path of annihilating the common enemy. (Sho: Translated from the June 4th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>The Voice of Scientific Victory (2): The Strong Japanese National Character: A Genetic View of the Japanese People</h3>
<p>"The Japanese people are the most typical of the Eastern peoples. When their self-restraint and quiet introversion reach a certain limit, they erupt like a volcano, acting recklessly when their temper flares, viewing their own lives as lighter than a feather. This is the greatest characteristic that distinguishes the Japanese from other Eastern peoples. The root of the Great Japanese Spirit of the Japanese, which is characterized by diving deep for pearls, magnificent sacrifice, and heroic martyrdom, lies in this." ... This is the Japanese national character first emphasized by Dr. Takuro Tamai, professor of science at Kyoto University. In his speech "Various Issues Regarding Japanese Heredity" at the 10th-anniversary commemorative lecture of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in Kanazawa City on the 6th, he compared the Chinese and Japanese, arguing that national character is largely influenced by genetic factors, and further elucidated the traces of the development of the Japanese national character formed by the country, climate, and history. Professor Tamai emphasized that the spirit of the fighting Japanese resides within, and the greatness of the "Japanese National Character Seen from a Genetic Perspective," the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>All heritable traits in organisms are determined by genetic factors, that is, heredity. All physical and mental traits that humans can see, whether normal or pathological, are always related to this gene in some way. For races and peoples, the number of traits and heredity that determine common destiny is not small. For example, regarding congenital resistance to diseases, blacks have almost none for yellow fever, and for tuberculosis, blacks and yellows are more resistant than whites.</p>
<p>This difference is naturally very meaningful in determining the elements of national destiny, but the issue I want to raise this time is that the difference in mental qualities between races and peoples is mostly influenced by genetic factors, and at the same time, this difference in mental qualities is greatly related to the rise and fall of nations, just as it can be seen more clearly than usual in the great war that the powerful nation is continuing for its survival. Only this kind of mental quality, temperament, and sentiment is called national character for a nation, which is greatly influenced by the country, climate, and history. Let us first discuss the physical characteristics and national character of the Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>The Japanese and Chinese were previously referred to collectively as the Hunan type in terms of blood type. The number of arch patterns and Class A hoof patterns in fingerprints is also less than that of Europeans, while the number of whorl patterns is greater, and the number of people with single eyelids is also greater. Physical hereditary qualities are also very similar. There are also commonalities in the national character of the two peoples. In terms of general temperament, they are both cautious and restrained, gentle and tolerant. These are the commonalities between the two. And this is absolutely the opposite of the extroverted temperament of Westerners. These differences and dissimilarities are determined by genetic factors, and there are naturally considerable differences in the mental qualities between the Japanese and Chinese. The Japanese are naturally careful and have easily impulsive emotions, but they strongly suppress their excitement due to internal restraint. This is because our country is small, the terrain is rich in changes, and the four seasons have obvious differences, which cultivates easily changing emotions and creates the habit of enduring natural disasters while resisting them. The fact that the country is a small and narrow region with limited transportation does not need to be advertised or exaggerated. Literature is like haiku, saving words; painting is mostly economical with strokes. And technology makes heavy work simpler.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Chinese, because it is a continent, lack changes in terrain and have many natural objects, so they have few emotional upheavals, their movements are slow, and their persistence is strong. Buildings and backgrounds are large-scale due to the large land, and language is ineffective unless used with loud scolding, and descriptions are often useless unless exaggerated or exaggerated. The huge difference in the integrity and culture of these two countries is because Japan is an island country, and the national character has been very simple for thousands of years, and there is no complexity in thoughts and feelings; in contrast, China has experienced very large shifts in the rise and fall of its nation, often accepting rulers with different thoughts and customs, and sometimes ruling different ethnic groups, or sometimes needing to trade with different ethnic groups, which has led to the formation of the Chinese national character. Therefore, the Japanese introversion and gratitude are developed from the original; in contrast, the Chinese introversion and gratitude are formed by necessary social training, and they are good at propaganda, and they are more developed in culture than Japan in form. Although the two countries are both the same Easterners, the Chinese are easier for Westerners to understand than the Japanese, and they are also easier to be close to. In short, the Japanese temperament, emotions, habits, and culture are all typical and pure Eastern-style, while the Chinese, in contrast, are similar to the West, at least with elements that are easy for Westerners to be close to. On this point, I think that the Japanese are the most typical and purest Easterners is a powerful basis. If the Japanese temperament is compared to cherry blossoms scattered briskly in a rainstorm, then the Chinese temperament can be compared to lilies sprouting under trampling and treading.</p>
<p>The introversion of the Japanese nation, which has naturally grown and matured in Japan's country and history, is a strongly suppressed inner energy. Once it erupts, it becomes the quiet divinity of "regarding death as returning home." This inner energy and spirit of self-sacrifice are completely similar, and this is the most obvious characteristic that distinguishes the Japanese from other Easterners. In today's Great East Asia War, this spirit is the driving force that vibrates our hearts every day, the achievements of brave soldiers. The inner energy that is connected with this spirit of self-sacrifice is rarely understood even by Westerners who have lived in Japan for many years. American leaders, because they do not understand the Japanese national character that has been generated and developed in the Japanese country, climate, and history, have caused the Japanese-American War. It is difficult for me to use appropriate words to describe the inner energy of those warriors fighting on the front lines, that kind of magnificent spiritual power. Thinking of this, I believe that the excellence of this unique Japanese national character in the world is due to heredity. This is the main topic that our academic community should study. The reason for publishing at the meeting is also here. (Tao: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Argentine New Government Orders Dissolution of Congress Yesterday; Diplomatic Policy Seems Unlikely to Change; Various Countries Cautious on the Issue of Recognition</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency: A Havas report: The new Argentine government dissolved Congress today.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 5th, Central News Agency: The Buenos Aires evening newspapers of the 5th had discussions on the diplomatic policy of the new Argentine government. The Shinriho (Truth News) reported that the Naval Minister specially appointed by General Rawson has sent formal notes to the diplomatic representatives of various countries, explaining the course of the revolution, its motives, and its objectives. The note reveals that the new government will follow the spirit of solidarity with the American continent and fulfil international treaties in its foreign policy. The Kurikiga News reported, citing sources close to the military council, that the new government does not wish to change the Argentine government's policy of maintaining neutrality, and is determined to maintain friendly relations with the United States and other American countries.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 7th, Central News Agency: Now that the selection of the Argentine new government has been completed, Rawson's cabinet is scheduled to be sworn in this afternoon. It is expected that after the cabinet members take office, Foreign Minister Martinez will convene a meeting of the diplomatic corps to formally notify them of the establishment of the new government. Although Argentine officials are optimistic, believing that the new government will not have difficulty obtaining foreign recognition, foreign governments seem to be adopting a wait-and-see policy to observe the trends of the new government. The diplomatic representatives of Latin American countries gathered at the private residence of Chilean Ambassador Gallardo last night to discuss countermeasures to the coup. After the meeting, Gallardo revealed that the envoys have decided to wait for the formal notification of the new government before negotiating the issue of recognition. Because the Argentine new government has demonstrated its complete control over national military and civilian affairs, the Argentine Navy has also begun to sail into the Port of La Plata. Arriving vessels include the 27,720-ton battleships "Moreno" and "Rivadavia," as well as all the cruisers belonging to the ocean fleet. They are obeying the orders issued by General Rawson last night, sailing from the Puerto Belgrano base to La Plata to await the new government's orders. Currently, order has been restored throughout Argentina. According to people close to the revolutionary leaders, the new government will maintain a neutral position as much as possible. At the same time, the police authorities have notified the police stations in the capital that current communist elements are preparing to distribute leaflets, explaining their position on the new situation. If found, they will be arrested. Since Friday, the Argentine capital has been peaceful. The only riot incident on that day was the burning of public buses by the crowd. According to official announcements, a total of 27 people were killed and 17 were injured in the coup. Most of them were casualties during the fighting in the suburbs of the capital. The people seem to have recognized the revolution as a fait accompli. The police are now serving as usual, but the authorities are still paying attention to prevention. Even today, when there is a lack of electricity, the streets and public buildings are brightly lit until sunrise. All newspapers have also published detailed accounts of the coup.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Argentina Safe</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram received by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the Japanese Ambassador to Argentina and 7,000 Japanese residents are all safe. Currently, there are no changes in Japanese-Argentine relations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry attaches great importance to the future policies of the new regime.</p>
<h3>Spain Pays Attention to Argentine Coup</h3>
<p>Madrid, 6th, Central News Agency: It is said from the Spanish capital that the Spanish people are closely watching the Argentine incident, because Argentina has close historical and economic ties with Spain. But the Spanish still maintain their determination not to get involved in the war. Spanish newspapers published the news of the sudden change in the Argentine capital under large headlines, but did not comment on it.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas report, the German political report said: After Churchill returned to Europe, he went to Algiers to participate in negotiations between Jilot and Tegor. As a result, Tegor won a great victory, in other words, Roosevelt failed. But on the other hand, Argentina is a sphere of influence of Britain, and now a coup has occurred under the manipulation of the United States. It can be seen that the situation in North Africa and the coup in Argentina are exchange conditions between Roosevelt and Churchill.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Active on the Eastern Front: Heavy Bombing of the Gorky Armory; Thousands of Tons of Bombs and Countless Incendiary Bombs Dropped</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to Havas, according to well-informed sources, hundreds of German long-range bombers again bombed the Soviet armory in the city of Gorky on the night of the 5th, with the Molotov automobile factory being the main target. The bombing lasted for two hours. German planes saw the huge fire caused by the bombing the night before from 150 kilometers away from the city, which was still burning. German planes bombed the city for two consecutive nights, dropping a thousand tons of bombs and countless incendiary bombs, causing 15 large fires.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th, Central News Agency: According to Havas, the German responsible party announced: German aircraft destroyed two important railway bridges on the Volkhov River, cutting off the supply line to the Leningrad front. German aircraft have been active in the upper reaches of the Volkhov River for many days, and finally destroyed the two bridges. As many as 17 Soviet aircraft were shot down in the battle.</p>
<p>Zurich, 7th, Central News Agency: The tension of the Eastern Front battle shifts according to the climate. However, although it is now the season suitable for large-scale operations, the entire front is almost calm, except for local battles in the Kupensk region and the Veriushu region north of Smolensk. Brown, a reporter for the British Standard Evening News, stayed in Moscow for fourteen months and recently returned to London. According to his report, Soviet mobilization has now reached its maximum limit, and the Soviet Union has planned to make all men and women with working ability engage in military industry or serve in the military. Regarding weapons, it is observed that the Soviet army is generally equal to the German army. However, according to past experience, although the Soviet army actively learns tactics in combat, it is ultimately not as elite as the German army, and the air force is also extremely weak. Soviet aircraft will never be able to compete with German Schmidt aircraft. Finally, what should be noted is that the Soviet army has gained some war experience from the German army, and the German army has also learned some lessons based on past experience. Furthermore, the German authorities are silent about the future of the war, and do not criticize the American propaganda that the German army will launch a defensive war. European military news is paying close attention to this. Recently, a British military commentator said, "The key to controlling the Eastern Front battle in the future is not which side wants to launch an attack or not, but which side must start an attack. Those who want to grasp the leadership of the battle and want to gain a favorable position will of course start the attack," which is also noteworthy.</p>
<h3>US House Passes Anti-Strike Bill</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency: According to a Havas Washington dispatch: The US House of Representatives has passed an anti-strike bill by a vote of 188 to 87. The bill stipulates that strikers must notify the authorities of their intention to strike at least thirty days before implementing the strike. It is generally believed that the bill is aimed at John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. Washington political circles pointed out that the bill is the first to give administrative authority to the Wartime Labor Bureau, which previously only followed the instructions of the President.</p>

<h3>The Disastrous Situation in North China is Dire: We Hope for Conservation to Aid in Relief Efforts. Our Newspaper Has Collected 700,000 in Donations. A Drop in the Bucket, but We Still Hope for Generous Contributions</h3>
<p>North China has suffered a prolonged drought leading to famine, and the sight of the starving dead along the roads is truly heartbreaking. All sectors of Shanghai society, having heard of the severity of the disaster, have been moved with compassion and cannot bear to see their compatriots in North China simply sit and wait for death. They have initiated a fundraising campaign for disaster relief. Thanks to the efforts of members of society and the advocacy of the press, donations have gradually accumulated to a considerable amount. However, given the vast scale of the natural disaster and the huge number of victims, these funds are but a drop in the bucket and may still be insufficient. We hope that all sectors will continue to contribute generously out of humanitarian compassion, so that the effort to provide relief to the suffering compatriots in North China can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and our newspaper received 70,000 yuan in donations. Among them, Mr. Luo Hongyi, chairman of Tailai Bank, donated 30,000 yuan as a Dragon Boat Festival gift, demonstrating great generosity and setting an example for the business community. Shanghai is not short of large-scale commercial firms, and we hope they will be inspired to rise to the occasion and help these disaster victims.</p>

<p>Glimpses from Letters Received</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association, stating: "In addition to our association's regular charitable activities, we are deeply concerned about the disastrous situation in North China, with starving people lining the roads and disaster victims crying out for food and relief. As fellow compatriots, we have an inescapable responsibility. Therefore, we have joined with our branches both in Shanghai and elsewhere to raise funds for disaster relief. The Wuxi branch has already raised 5,000 yuan, which, together with the 5,000 yuan raised by this association, makes a total of 10,000 yuan. Please accept this sum on behalf of our association and remit it accordingly. We will send further contributions later and request that this letter be published to encourage our members to respond to the call for help and expand our relief efforts. We are extremely anxious." Mr. Chuan Zihou wrote: "Zihou has resided in Shanxi for generations but conducts business in Shanghai. Recently, my father came south for the first time to visit Shanghai and was honored to receive invitations and generous hospitality from friends and fellow townsmen. We are deeply grateful. As my father is about to return home, he initially intended to host a banquet to reciprocate the kindness. However, considering the severity of the drought in North China and the widespread suffering, we have decided to use the funds allocated for the banquet to provide emergency relief. We are specifically presenting 5,000 yuan in national currency and earnestly request that your newspaper remit it to the disaster area for prompt distribution. Although it may be a drop in the bucket, it is still a small contribution. By slightly reducing spending, we can also benefit friends and fellow townsmen. We believe that you, gentlemen, will readily agree with this." Mr. Shen Qingru of Qingru Elementary School wrote: "In view of the severity of the disaster in North China and the urgent need for relief, our school initiated a disaster relief donation campaign on the first of this month. Within a week, teachers and students collectively donated 1,105 yuan. We are now submitting this amount to your newspaper to be used for relief funds. We also hope that schools and institutions throughout Shanghai will rise up in response and jointly participate in this righteous cause so that millions of disaster victims can be rescued from their desperate situation. We cannot express our hopes enough." The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association and the benevolent and righteous actions of Mr. Fu and Mr. Shen are worthy of emulation by all sectors of society.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper Holds a Charity Auction and Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting, Soliciting Generous Donations of Valuables from All Sectors. Mr. Wang Jimei and Others Donate Valuable Calligraphy and Paintings</h3>
<p>In order to increase the funds for urgent disaster relief in North China, this newspaper plans to hold a charity exhibition of valuable calligraphy and paintings. Yesterday afternoon, we invited Mr. Ding Huikang, Mr. Wang Jimei, Mr. Lang Jingshan, Mr. Xu Langxi, Mr. Xia Jiancheng, and Mr. Liu Haisu (in order of stroke count of surnames) to discuss the arrangements. The following points were agreed upon:</p>
<p>(1) The event will be named "North China Urgent Disaster Relief Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wu Hufan and Mr. Zhao Shuru will be additionally appointed as committee members.</p>
<p>(3) We are soliciting donations of valuable items from famous calligraphers and painters and famous collectors in this city to participate in the charity auction. If you are willing to donate, please send them to the Social Services Department of this newspaper immediately. A receipt will be issued, and the deadline for receiving items is the 18th of this month. The items received will be announced daily in this newspaper.</p>
<p>(4) The date of the exhibition and charity auction will be determined and announced separately.</p>
<p>The above is a picture of refugees drawn by Mr. Wang Jimei's father, Mr. Wang Yiting. The late Mr. Wang was a master painter of his generation who devoted his life to charity, and his virtue and kindness were widely admired by those in distress. The refugee picture he created came from a compassionate heart. Now, his son, Mr. Jimei, is willing to part with a famous piece from his family collection for urgent disaster relief and is even donating a picture of refugees for the charity auction. The significance is profound, and we are deeply impressed.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Wu Zemin of Jinjiang yesterday generously donated a hand scroll by Wen Tianxiang, which is quite valuable. Furthermore, Mr. Fang Hangsu has been selling valuable calligraphy and paintings for charity, as reported in a previous issue. Now, he is donating six panels of peony screens by Jin Baotian, six panels of calligraphy screens by He Yunjie, two couplets by Zhang Jianxun, two couplets by Qian Renlong, two couplets by Wu Yuting, two couplets by West Lake Yilan, and a central painting of Zhong Jinshi, totaling twenty-one items, for charity sale to aid North China disaster relief. We deeply admire the enthusiasm for disaster relief shown by these gentlemen.</p>
<h3>Old Zhabei District: Strengthening Self-Defense Work, Public Venues Form Self-Defense Groups</h3>
<p>To strengthen the self-defense work in the Old Zhabei District, special self-defense groups will be organized in various public venues. Each bao is required to complete the organization within three days. The organizational outline is as follows: (1) Public venues: cinemas, theaters, opera houses, hotels, dance halls, ice cream parlors (cafes), teahouses, billiard rooms, ice rinks, department stores, and other public venues. (2) Department stores should be divided into separate units: rooftop amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, dance halls, shopping areas, ice cream parlors, and other separately established sections. (3) Each of the above public venues should form a group for each floor. If the area is large, it should be divided into north-south or front-back groups. (4) The number of people in each group should be based on actual needs, with a minimum of four to eight members in the special self-defense group. (5) Each group should have one leader. (6) The special self-defense group is responsible for surveillance, patrol, and guard duty. (7) Each group's duty time is three hours per shift. (8) After assigning the number of people, each public venue should also specify the patrol order and duty locations of each member. (9) Each member and leader should submit four copies of a detailed resume with a 2.5-inch photo, including their place of origin, age, occupation, and address, to the committee for record keeping and transfer. (10) Each public venue should draw a floor plan for each floor and section, detailing the patrol routes and duty locations of the special self-defense group, and submit four copies to the committee for record keeping and transfer. (11) Each bao should list the names of the public venues with special self-defense groups within their jurisdiction, the type of business, the name of the person in charge, the number of floors, the number of members in the special self-defense group and the leader, and the business address, and submit four copies to the committee for record keeping and transfer to the military and police authorities. (12) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, the committee will revise and supplement them at any time and notify the relevant departments for implementation.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Cooking Oil Should Be Done By Representatives of Landlords, Distributed to Each Sub-Tenant According to Household Size</h3>
<p>The issuance of cooking oil with the third-period house tax receipt began universally on the 5th of this month, and the promotion is progressing smoothly with the assistance of baojia personnel in each district. However, many residents are not familiar with the procedures, and after completing the registration, it is not the landlord who carries a larger container to apply for the oil from the designated retail store. Instead, most of the sub-tenants (third-tier tenants) go to purchase oil individually with their own containers. This not only increases the workload of the personnel at each retail store but also is not in accordance with the regulations, resulting in many citizens being unable to purchase the oil. It is now announced that those who have completed the registration procedures must, on the designated date, go to the original retail store and have the landlord representative purchase the oil on their behalf. Individual visits by each sub-tenant are not necessary. At the same time, when purchasing oil, the landlord should collect all household registration certificates in advance; otherwise, it will delay the oil purchase time. Once the oil is purchased, it must be distributed fairly according to the number of people recorded on the household registration certificate, without other excuses.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Datong University</h3>
<p>— Central News Agency</p>
<p>Datong University, which has never experienced a strike in its more than thirty years of existence, was founded in the first year of the Republic (1912). It is known for its simple academic style and its strength in mathematics and science. Under the school motto of "Illustrating virtue, renovating the people, and resting in the highest excellence," faculty and students always strive in their respective positions, and thus, for decades, they have maintained the dignity and style of the school. Datong University is now divided into four colleges: the College of Arts, the College of Science, the College of Commerce, and the College of Engineering. The College of Arts is divided into the Department of Literature, the Department of Political Geography, and the Department of Bamboo Studies. The College of Science is divided into the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, and the Department of Chemistry. The College of Commerce is divided into the Department of Economics, the Department of Banking, the Department of Accounting, and the Department of Business Administration. The College of Engineering is divided into the Department of Civil Engineering, the Department of Electrical Engineering, and the Department of Chemical Engineering. There are a total of 1,370 students. The equipment has not been affected by the war and is still relatively complete. Experiments in physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering are still being conducted as usual. The library mainly provides extracurricular reading materials for students, mostly in Chinese and Japanese.</p>
<p>President Hu Dunfu also serves as the Dean of Academic Affairs. He is a pragmatist who does not engage in empty talk. One can get a glimpse of his character from his simple attire. The reporter had a half-hour conversation with him at a casual banquet the day before Teachers' Day. Our topic shifted from the case of a female teacher who was insulted and died in indignation and the case of a sixteen-year-old youth who committed murder to the failure of education. Those who run education should be vigilant. President Hu hopes that those who run education in the future will truly focus on cultivating young people. He then talked about the living problems of teachers and staff. Datong University can be proud of having veteran teachers with more than thirty years of service. Most of the teachers and staff have a service history of more than ten years. Under the high cost of living, the salaries of teachers and staff are of course just barely enough to make a living, but their frugal life is for the sake of education. Their spirit of fighting in hardship is admirable.</p>
<p>Finally, talking about student life, those who run education in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, often neglect physical education. This is due to the environment. The physical education facilities at Datong University are not perfect, and student physical education will certainly not develop well. However, they diligently focus on academic research. The students themselves have organized various scientific research associations and hold research discussion meetings every week. Indeed, they are studying for the sake of studying!</p>
<h3>The World Red Swastika Society Begins Accepting Refugees, Having Already Accommodated 92 Refugees, and Establishes a Medical Office to Examine Their Health</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society's Shanghai Refugee Occupational Training Center's Executive Committee notified the three municipal government agencies last month to collect refugees in batches and send them to the center for education and training. It also actively arranged various sanitary facilities within the Caohejing Center. The Red Swastika Society has sent one physician, two female nurses, and one pharmacist to organize a medical office. It has been reported that the French Concession police sent 92 refugees on the 31st of last month, including 89 males and 3 females, with 58 from Jiangsu Province, 21 from Zhejiang Province, 3 from Anhui Province, 2 from Guangdong Province, 1 from Hunan Province, 2 from Hubei Province, 1 from Fujian Province, 3 from Hebei Province, and 1 from Shandong Province. The center has sent physicians to examine their health, accommodate them, and assign them to labor. The head of the Training Section, Zhang Tingdong, has stipulated lecture and spiritual conversation times to carry out all training. The order is still good. The names, ages, and places of origin of the refugees accommodated by the center are listed below:</p>
<h3>The Baojia Youth Department Holds a Respect-for-Teachers Campaign, From Mid-Next Month Until the Summer Vacation, Holding Lectures, Competitions, and Public Debates</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia Youth Department believes that the recent case of female teacher Su Yizhi being insulted and dying in indignation is an unfortunate phenomenon in current school education. To reform the academic atmosphere of contempt for teachers, the department has specifically decided to hold a respect-for-teachers campaign from mid-next month until the end of the summer vacation in each school.</p>
<p>Public Debate on the Respect-for-Teachers Issue</p>
<p>The Baojia Youth Department has been preparing for this campaign for many days. They will give speeches at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road and on radio stations such as Calling Station XGOI, and hold award-winning competitions. They may also hold a public debate on the issue of respect for teachers at the Grand Guangming Theater and invite teachers and other educators from various schools to participate.</p>
<p>Teacher Salaries Lower Than Those of Servants</p>
<p>At the same time, according to a reporter from the Times, current teacher salaries are very low and in fact lower than those of ordinary servants or waitresses. In general, teachers teach an average of 60 hours per week, and their salaries are at most only 500 yuan, which is not enough to maintain a personal life. Therefore, many teachers take on part-time tutoring jobs to barely make ends meet.</p>
<h3>The Third Board of Directors of the Children's Library Is Appointed</h3>
<p>The term of office of the second board of directors of the Shanghai Children's Library has expired. The following eleven people have been appointed as the third board of directors: Lin Buji, Ying Yongyu, Yin Huanzhi, Sha Renyan, Xiao Kaixian, Hu Zuyin, Feng Qiming, Zhang Yunlong, Zhang Yuanfu, Xu Weilin, and Ding Bingnan. The library has recently added 8,964 books. In March and April of this year, the number of children who read and borrowed books totaled 9,098. In May, the total number (including children who read at the library, children who read on the mobile library, children who read at circulation stations, and children who borrowed books individually and in groups) was 10,737. It has also been reported that the library's fundraising campaign ended successfully at the end of May, with donations exceeding the target. The champion was Feng Qiming, the third place was Ying Yongyu, and the second place was Chen Chunhua.</p>
<h3>Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Strictly Supervises the Allocation of Sugar to Various Industries, Special Allocations Cannot Be Resold, Eliminating the Abuse of Sugar Rationed According to Household Size</h3>
<p>After the military allocation authorities approved the adjustment of the prices of specially allocated sugar to various industries by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, in order to strictly manage the allocation and supervise its use, it is stipulated that the allocated sugar may only be used for processing food products and for the industry's own use and may not be resold as raw sugar to any business or individual. If any business uses the guise of manufacturing candy to secretly transform the sugar into granulated sugar form and smuggle it for export, the relevant stores will be permanently suspended from receiving allocations. Depending on the severity of the circumstances, they will be subject to business suspension or other severe penalties.</p>
<p>Allocating Food for Various Industries</p>
<p>The Cooperative Business Office has already determined the allocation quantity for each industry's special allocation needs, based on the adjusted new sugar price of 9 yuan per jin, and has notified them to purchase from the designated retailers. It is reported that all households that have been allocated sugar have complied with the deadline to obtain permits, pay fees, and take delivery of the goods.</p>
<p>Strictly Supervising Sugar Rationed According to Household Size</p>
<p>For the third period of sugar rationed according to household size, the Cooperative Business Office, in order to eliminate abuses by various retailers, stipulates: (1) No exceeding the price limit. (2) No reducing the quantity or adulterating the sugar. (3) No deliberately making things difficult for buyers. (4) No unauthorized moving or concealing of allocated sugar for resale. (5) The store selling the sugar will be fully responsible for any shortages in the sugar inventory. Violators will be punished depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession Self-Defense Corps Increases the Number of Duty Shifts, From 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM</h3>
<p>The duty hours for the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps were originally from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily, with a three-hour shift, totaling five shifts. Now, the baojia authorities, considering that the weather is getting warmer and in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the Self-Defense Corps' work, have specifically stipulated that, starting from the 11th of this month, an additional shift will be added and the time will be changed to run from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM, still with a three-hour shift.</p>
<h3>The Epidemic Prevention Committee Announces the Results of Epidemic Prevention Over the Past Three Years, With the Mortality Rate of Typhoid Fever Being the Highest, Strengthening the Implementation of Prevention This Year</h3>
<p>The epidemic prevention movement in the Central China region this year has made greater progress than in the past due to the unified injection methods and the issuing of epidemic prevention certificates by the Central China Epidemic Prevention Committee. Shanghai, with its small area and dense population, is susceptible to the spread of epidemics. Fortunately, the joint prevention efforts of the municipal government and the two concessions have improved the situation over the years. The injection movement this year was launched promptly, and the number of people injected with cholera vaccines is close to one million. It is hoped that citizens who have not yet been injected will get their vaccinations in the shortest possible time. In addition to preventing cholera, the authorities will also thoroughly eliminate diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, and smallpox.</p>
<p>Effective Results Achieved in Three Years of Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee recently announced the results of its investigation into epidemic prevention work based on the above-mentioned significance. The total number of infectious disease patients from January to May this year was 1,006. The number during the same period in 1940 (Republic Year 29) was 3,131, in 1941 it was 2,228, and in 1942 it was 2,441. Therefore, this year's number decreased by two-thirds compared to 1940 and by half compared to last year. This is the effective result of epidemic prevention over the past three years, and the bad name of "Shanghai, the City of Infectious Diseases" can be eliminated from now on.</p>
<p>Attention Must Be Paid to Injury Prevention</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, among the 1,006 infectious disease patients from January to May this year, the types of diseases were as follows (the numbers in parentheses are the number of deaths): dysentery 105 (62), typhoid fever 370 (300), typhus 14 (2), smallpox 24 (6), measles 131 (12), scarlet fever 30 (1), diphtheria 141 (42), epidemic meningitis 191 (64). From the above statistics, it can be seen that the mortality rate of typhoid fever is the highest, so it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of typhoid fever vaccination.</p>
<h3>Preaching in Ward Road Prison is Changed to Buddhism, Hosted by Dharma Master Fan Cheng</h3>
<p>There has been preaching in the Public Concession Ward Road Prison, mainly by personnel from British and American Christian churches. Now, in order to adapt to the environment, the prison authorities have changed the preaching to be based on Buddhism. They have hired Dharma Master Fan Cheng, president of the Shanghai Buddhist Fellowship at 418 Hart Road, to host the sermons. As an initial trial, several prisoners sentenced to death were targeted. After three days, the prisoners seemed to be moved. This type of edification work will be implemented more effectively in the future.</p>
<h3>French Concession Entertainment Venues Establish Self-Police</h3>
<p>Within the French Concession's theaters and entertainment venues, a new type of "Self-Police" has been established since the other day. They are responsible for observing the actions of visitors and inspecting the premises for dangerous items. According to the naming system of the French Concession's Baojia, it is "Civil Police." It is said that the mission and duties of this newly established "Self-Police" are no different from those of the Civil Police. However, the Self-Police are hired by the theaters and entertainment venues and are not subordinate to the Joint Defense Office. Therefore, their spirit of service leads to the same goal through different paths as the Civil Police.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the first article of the National Forum, "Closing Gambling Venues and Re-weighing on High-Interest Pawns," from "within the ninth line, think carefully about defending these two so-called entertainment venues" to "not a few, they" should be connected after the second article, "Talking about Jai Alai and Dog Racing Venues in the Midst of the Ban on Gambling Venues," after "request the authorities to prohibit" in the [unclear character] line, "before the phrase 'having curiosity'." Therefore, the ending sentence of the eighth line of the first article should be: "the satisfaction of enjoyment, the desire for money, and also taking advantage of the gamblers' luck and the psychology of 'wanting to win more after winning and wanting to recoup losses after losing,' to achieve their..." This error was due to typesetting, and we hereby correct it and apologize to the readers.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jinhai's Tragic Death Case Continued Trial Yesterday Morning The Trial Judge Was Obstructed and Humiliated En Route The Court Is Currently Negotiating Based on Reason Witness Mi Lei Was Summoned to Court for Confrontation The Court Ordered a Reschedule for Further Hearing on the 14th</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the French Concession Police's extortion of a confession through illegal means, resulting in the tragic death of young Zhang Jinhai, the Second Special District Local Court of this city reopened the trial for a group of Chinese criminals yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, Puxiego, the chief of the Central District of the French Concession Police, again assaulted and insulted Judge Wang Lansheng en route. It is not yet certain whether he intended to obstruct the trial of the case, but the disregard for Chinese judges is undeniable. As a result, the opening of the court was delayed by as much as forty minutes. The trial of the entire case was adjourned at around 12:00 noon. The next court session is scheduled for early morning on June 14th. It is currently unknown whether arguments will begin at that time. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Police Guarded the Courtroom, Seats Were Full</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession had already begun to be guarded. French police were stationed from Rue Massenet to the intersection of Rue Lafayette, and all pedestrians were prohibited from passing through. Vehicles were also stopped, essentially implementing a partial lockdown, and the security was extremely tight. At that time, the spectator seats inside and outside the courtroom were already full, indicating that the public's concern for the case remained unwavering. Zhang's family members arrived at the court on time, and Zhang's wife was still dressed in full mourning attire. The four witnesses for the case all reported on time and waited quietly in the police office. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn.</p>
<p>The Trial Judge Was Humiliated En Route</p>
<p>Wang Lansheng, a judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Local Court, and one of the judges hearing the Zhang case, walked from his residence to the court yesterday morning intending to open the trial. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Rue Massenet, he was suddenly blocked from passing through by Puxiego, the chief of the Central District of the French Concession Police. Judge Wang immediately presented his official credentials, but they were ignored, leading to a dispute. Judge Wang's serge jacket was torn on the spot. To maintain the dignity of the judge, Judge Wang did not succumb to this humiliation and was eventually allowed to pass through. He immediately reported the experience of being humiliated to the court, and the court is currently negotiating with the French Concession Police based on reason. Although it is not yet clear whether this action was a deliberate attempt to obstruct the trial of the Zhang case, the disregard for Chinese judges and obstruction of official duties is undeniable.</p>
<p>The First Witness Testified About the Incident</p>
<p>Because of the incident where Judge Wang was assaulted and humiliated, the opening of the court was delayed by as much as forty minutes. At 9:45 AM, Qian Sen, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie, Judge Wang Lansheng, and Chief Clerk Li Dingfan ascended the bench to hear the case. At this time, the lawyers for both the plaintiffs and defendants were sitting upright. First, Qian Sen, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division, ordered the seven defendants to be brought forward. Judicial police then escorted Guo Shiyuan and others into the defendant's box. Next, Li Xiuying's neighbor, Wang Xiqing, was brought to the court. According to his testimony: He is 32 years old, from Pudong, and works as a carpenter. He is a neighbor of Li Xiuying. On the morning of the 29th, Li asked him to go to the Zhi Cheng Ji sock shop to inquire if they had found her lost laundry ticket. He went to the shop and inquired, but the shop owner Zhang Yuebo denied the matter, so he returned home and told Li Xiuying. Li then invited him to go to the Yi Hua laundry shop to report the loss of the ticket. On the way, they met patrol officer No. 652, whom he knew, and he invited the officer to go to the laundry shop as a guarantor. When they arrived at the Yi Hua laundry shop, the employees said that someone had already claimed it. When asked who had claimed it, the shop employee said that it was someone with an eye defect who looked like an apprentice. Therefore, he asked the Yi Hua shop employee to go to the Zhi Cheng Ji sock shop to identify the person, but the shop owner still strongly denied it, so Li Xiuying reported it to the police. He then went home, etc. Patrol officer No. 652, Wu Fusheng, stated: That day, the civilians were ordered to go out and collect fines. He was passing through the intersection of Rue Massenet when he met Wang Xiqing, who invited him to go to the laundry shop to report the loss as a guarantor. Because he could not refuse out of politeness, he went with them. When they arrived at the shop, the clerk said that someone who looked like an apprentice had already claimed it. Therefore, he and the shop employee Feng Quansheng went to the Cheng Ji sock shop to identify the person, saying that Peng Shuanglong had gone to claim it. However, the shop owner denied it. Therefore, Li reported it to the police, and detectives were dispatched to investigate. He did not know anything else.</p>
<p>Mi Lei Was Brought to Court for Confrontation</p>
<p>At this point in the trial, the chief culprit, French Concession officer Mi Lei, was summoned to court for confrontation. He spoke French, and a translator spoke on his behalf. The court informed him that he was being summoned as a witness and that he must tell the truth. Mi Lei then stated that the matter of Li's lost ticket was delivered to the detective office at 5:30 on April 29th. He had not gone out before that time and had only been talking in another room of the police station. First, a Russian private investigator reported it, and then Chinese detective No. 417 questioned him. When Guo Shiyuan came, it was around 6:00 PM, and he claimed to be guaranteeing his employee. He did not know him in the past. According to Guo, he knew him. At this point, Peng and Zhang were brought to the front for confrontation. They were taken to a small room, and detective No. 417 interrogated them in the room. He did not pay attention beforehand. Peng and Zhang had been beaten. When he entered the small room, No. 417 was tying Peng to a stool. He did not pour the water. After Peng was let down, Zhang was also tied up by Zaishu. He and Chinese detective Zhang Guiqing poured water on them again. The two Chinese detectives straddled Zhang and Peng's lower bodies. Because the bindings were not tight, fearing that they would turn and jump up, Mi Lei admitted to rubbing Zhang's ribs with his fist. After releasing the bindings, because he saw that his expression was not good, he poured spirits on him. When the torture was being carried out, Guo told him in French that he did not admit to picking up the laundry ticket. He did not help to pour water on Guo. The court questioned him, asking why he was still denying it when Guo had said that the boss had already admitted it. Mi Lei replied that he had not heard it. At this point, Chinese detective Wang Zaishu requested to speak, saying: At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, before the autopsy, Mi Lei instructed the Zhou translator to tell him to prohibit him from speaking about the circumstances of Zhang Jinhai being beaten, but he could say that Zhang's head injury was caused by Zhang hitting his head against the wall himself. If he did not believe it, he could ask the court to summon the Zhou translator for confrontation.</p>
<p>Beclier and Peng Shuanglong Were Confronted</p>
<p>Next, witness Beclier was summoned. He stated that he was a 30-year-old French national and an officer of the Central Police Station. Li Hongda and two others served as translators for the Li case. He admitted to slapping faces, but denied using fists and kicking. Later, Peng said that the clothes were in the shop upstairs, so he sent Zhu Songcheng to bring Zhang Jinhai and others to the police station. He did not beat them, and Li and Zhu did not beat them either. Because Zhang did not admit it, he was sent to the detective office. Chief Justice Qian then summoned Peng Shuanglong, asking who had beaten him. He stated that all three had beaten him, slapping faces and punching, and then throwing him to the ground. Unable to withstand the torture, he immediately confessed that the clothes were upstairs. Then Zhang Jinhai was also brought to the police station. In addition to slapping Zhang's face, someone also hit Zhang's buttocks with a wooden stick, but he could not remember who hit Zhang at the time because he was not conscious. When he was escorted to the detective office, Beclier beat him all the way in the back. After being beaten at the detective office, Guo also slapped his face. Unable to withstand the torture, Zhang agreed to compensate, but Guo replied that he could not, and he had to admit to picking it up.</p>
<p>Detectives Zhang and Wang Requested to Speak</p>
<p>French Concession Chinese detective Zhang Guiqing also asked to speak. After the court allowed it, Zhang stated that he did not help with the beating. He entered the small room at the request of Zhang Yuebo to inspect the interior. This could be confirmed by Zhang. Wang Zaishu also denied the beating. On May 4th, various newspapers had already revealed that the French authorities ordered the personnel present on that day to make a report. After he made the report truthfully, Mi Lei told the translator to listen to it, and he expressed great dissatisfaction, saying that he was responsible for beating people to death. He then tore up the original report and made another one.</p>
<p>Mi Lei and Beclier Were Summoned Again for Confrontation</p>
<p>At this point, the police lawyer Xu Wufang requested that Mi Lei and Beclier be confronted. After the court approved it, Mi Lei and Beclier were summoned to court again. They were asked whether Peng and Zhang had been beaten after being escorted to the detective office. Mi Lei said no, he only saw Zhang's cheeks were red. Beclier also only admitted to slapping faces, denying other illegal tortures. Li Hongkui and Zhu Songcheng's testimonies were the same as Beclier's, but Wang Zaishu stated that Zhang and Peng had injuries and had reported it to Mi Lei, intending to send them to the hospital for treatment, but Mi Lei refused, saying it was not important. When questioned, Mi Lei said that he could not remember clearly. The person who discovered Zhang Jinhai's death was the number one brain. At that time, Zhang's heart was still warm, so he was sent to Guangci Hospital, but unexpectedly, he was too injured to be treated and died. The court questioned again whether Guo Shiyuan had said the words "old whore." Mi Lei replied that he had not heard it.</p>
<p>Summoning Witnesses, the Court Ordered a Reschedule</p>
<p>Kang Wanqing, an employee of the socks and shirt shop, who was not summoned, testified that he handled Li Xiuying's purchase of socks, and the banknotes were counted clearly in person, and no laundry ticket was inserted. Later, he was taken to the police station. Li Hongkui had slapped his face and punched him. At that time, his nerves were stimulated, and he was unclear. After Guo Shiyuan arrived at the police station and spoke with Mi Lei, Mi Lei's expression was very unhappy, and he dragged Zhang to a small room, and Guo also followed. Chen Pengli, the owner of Xie Xinghao, testified that he had gone to the Cheng Ji shop to inquire about whether they had found the laundry ticket at the request of Wang Xiqing. Li Xiuying's father, Li Yinsheng, was also summoned to the court. He testified that he had sent the clothes, including two pairs of riding breeches and a wool coat, costing 48 yuan for washing, and a velvet robe, costing 20 yuan, for a total of 68 yuan. The laundry ticket was given to his eldest daughter for safekeeping and stored under the bedding. The court questioned whether it was lost at home or lost outside, and when he learned that the laundry ticket was lost, he testified that he only learned about it the day after. According to his daughter, it was lost when buying socks. At this point, it was past 12:00 noon, so the court announced an adjournment and rescheduled the trial to June 14th.</p>

<h3>Father's Words</h3>
<p>— Geng Sheng</p>
<p>Gambling has left me with a painful history. Thinking back, my heart still aches faintly. It caused me to suffer a life-threatening crisis, and it led me down the path of destruction. Just when I was deeply mired in the mud and unable to extricate myself, my father's sudden return saved me from the depths of misery. My father's words deeply moved me, and I gave up my gambling addiction. I was saved. I will never forget my father's words. I respectfully record them below as a memorial:</p>
<p>"Child, in the short span of two months, you have changed. I never expected you to change so quickly, it is truly hard for me to believe! Two months ago, you were a very promising child. I left home with peace of mind, entrusting the entire family to you. I believed in you, I loved you. But child, in just two months, gambling has destroyed my child. I never dreamed of it! Because of gambling, your generous nature has been extinguished, your reason has been lost, and you have torn up your past reputation with your own hands, using various means to fill this bottomless hole. You cheat, you steal, and at that time, your mind was only focused on how to get money, and reason no longer existed. Gambling has turned you into a beast! Child, I have five children, and you are the one I love the most. I have the highest hopes for you, but you have lost me. How discouraged I am!</p>
<p>For the sake of the family's livelihood, I left home. But ah, in just two months, gambling has changed your entire life! In recent years, my fate has been full of setbacks, and my career has been unsuccessful. I often feel that everything is not as good as others. When I am self-pitying, I often comfort myself: I have a good son, he is already an adult, honest and kind by nature, and smart and capable. The thousands of injustices in my heart disappear. But when I came home and heard everything about you recently, not only did it tear up my dreams for you, but also the only thoughts of self-comfort and self-relief in the past vanished. The most heartbreaking thing in the world is to disappoint those who have the highest hopes for you. Now, I have suffered this. You have destroyed the hope in my heart, and you have burdened me with debt.</p>
<p>That night, although I was tired from the journey, both my body and mind were exhausted, but thinking about your affairs, I could not sleep peacefully. There was a time when I was drowsy and fell asleep, but soon I suddenly woke up, and your affairs seeped into my mind again. I thought vaguely: No, it can't be! My child wouldn't become like this, right? This is perhaps just a terrible nightmare. At that time, a glimmer of hope arose in my mind, hoping to prove that it was indeed a dream. So I opened my eyes, and thought quietly, thinking about everything during the day, but this proved that it was indeed a fact, something that my son had done. My heart felt like it was being devoured by a snake, I felt a suffocating pain, and I cried secretly.</p>
<p>Child! You are young, inexperienced, and have little experience. You have seen too few of the thousands upon thousands of people destroyed by gambling. How often have you seen gamblers start a business? But the old staff of the gambling venues get rich by gambling! The gambling venues squeeze the essence and blood of the gamblers and kill tens of thousands of promising young people! Although you have also won, it is like a borrowed debt. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or a month, a year later, you still have to pay it back with interest! And eventually end up in complete ruin, this is a certain truth. Child, you can change. With firm will and perseverance, never step into the gambling venues again, and you will surely be saved.</p>
<p>Child, you are still young, and you still have a bright future. Are you willing to embark on the right path from now on, cautiously, to become a complete person, and rebuild your past reputation? Or are you willing to let gambling ruin your life? I cannot see you heading down the path of destruction, I want to do my best to save you from the pit of fire! Although you are heavily in debt because of gambling, as long as you are hardworking and thrifty, there will always be a time to repay it. In a few years, you can regain your freedom and raise your head again! But you must remember, you must not have the thought of recouping your losses, otherwise, you will surely repeat the same mistakes. You are now burdened with a not small amount of debt. For the sake of your debts, we are all willing to suffer for a few years, as long as we can get my child back. For your sake, I am willing to sacrifice everything I have, as long as it can bring you back to the right path and make you a complete person. In the future, we will try our best to be hardworking and thrifty in order to repay your debts as soon as possible. Child, our family is about to be destroyed by you, now, we should rebuild it. If you listen to me, a new family will reappear in front of us in a few years, or in the near future, and the happiness at that time will be indescribable. But if you don't take my words seriously, and still think that it is not to be feared, and repeat the same mistakes, you will be beyond saving for the rest of your life! When you stumble again and cannot recover, and fall into the abyss of suffering, unable to extricate yourself, when you think of my words today, the sadness and regret at this time can also be imagined. At that time, perhaps I will no longer be here, or you will be older, and although you want to work hard to change your ways, it will be too late, and you will regret it for the rest of your life. Child, remember my words, don't leave the regrets for the future."</p>
<h3>Thought, Desire, Emotion</h3>
<p>— Meng Xun</p>
<p>Desire is a mutation in which thought and emotion lose their balance: it can make you feel the flight of life, and it can also teach your life to be impossible.</p>
<p>The most successful "art" of exerting desire is none other than gambling: it suddenly takes you to heaven - full of joy and full of spirit; it suddenly throws you into hell - with a sad and bitter face, and irredeemable regret. Therefore, desire is by no means an easy fellow to deal with. It is only a qualitative monster residing between "emotion" and "reason."</p>
<p>Emotion, however, has its innate function. It is calmer and less explosive than desire. It is the source of inner beauty; it is even more the greenhouse for cultivating humanity: with it, this is what makes us feel the joy between people, and a kind of common evolutionary demand naturally arises.</p>
<p>As for her value in existence between the sexes, it will never be fully explained.</p>
<p>Love stories are forever new and eternal. In fact, thousands and tens of thousands of books are published every year, just to tell the emotional changes between the sexes, thereby showing some new type of "Romance." This one end alone is enough to prove that "emotion" is originally a "priceless treasure."</p>
<p>However, the problem must be returned to thought. Only he can have the supreme authority to "correct emotion" and "judge desire."</p>
<p>As the proverb says, "When the flames of anger and the waters of desire are about to boil, knowing it clearly, and committing it clearly: who knows it? Who commits it? Turning one's thoughts suddenly at this point, turning evil into good is truly a gentleman." This is a metaphor for the fierce battle between "emotion" and "desire," which is not conducive to thought, but instead reads to thought! The so-called "turning of thoughts"! Victory; then man must inevitably be transformed into an incarnation of demons.</p>
<p>Therefore, thought is often in the position of arbitration and leadership between "emotion" and "desire."</p>
<p>Emotion that has not undergone thought training is a very primitive emotion. Just like desire that has not been approved by thought, it is simply another name for "bestial action."</p>
<p>Immerse thought in the study of objective things.</p>
<p>Entrust desire to the ambition of seeking scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Connect emotion to the fate of oppressed people.</p>
<p>If you can do this, you will gain satisfaction in life itself.</p>
<h3>Temper</h3>
<p>— Yan Weisheng</p>
<p>A person's temper can directly affect his relationship with others, and at the same time, it can determine his own achievements.</p>
<p>The so-called temper seems to be just an external manifestation, but upon careful thought, it must "exist within" before it can "take shape outside." Therefore, it can be understood that people with violent tempers certainly have dissatisfied places in their hearts. Of course, everyone has their own personality, but those who specialize in "owing him a lot and returning him a little" and want to vent their bad temper on others are mostly committing the problem of "selfishness," only caring about their own comfort and never putting themselves in other people's shoes. In the family, it is certainly like a tyrant, with no harmony or love to speak of. Even outside, he is a forever lonely person, because no one will come to suffer your anger for a long time. You have a bad temper, how can others endure it?</p>
<p>However, a person who has no temper at all is also useless, because temper can also represent a person's "spirit." "Tolerance" and "accommodation" are limited. If everything is ignored, lowering one's voice and tone, and turning the right cheek after being slapped on the left, how can it be the true color of a great man.</p>
<p>Therefore, temper should be expressed when it should be expressed. In daily interactions with people, there should always be some "cultivation" skills, to be calm, "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Being able to provide convenience to others is also convenience for yourself. A good temper contains the meaning of "self-control." Disciplining oneself to not be indulgent is the most important work in life. People who achieve complete success in their careers and in human affairs do suffer a loss if they lose their temper on some unnecessary things.</p>
<h3>The Increasingly Serious Leprosy Problem in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wang Dai</p>
<p>It is said that leprosy spreads mostly in places close to the tropics, so in China, the South is particularly prevalent. But that is not the case. Just taking Shanghai as an example, twenty years ago, this kind of disease was rarely heard of. According to reports from Hongkou and Skin Hospital in 1934, 200 cases of leprosy were discovered among those seeking treatment. And recently, in the Zilin Road Leprosy Sanatorium, there are more than one hundred patients with severe cases. The number of people seeking treatment at the daily clinic is increasing day by day. According to experts, there are at least 2,000 people, and there are many who hide their illness and avoid doctors, so the number should also be quite a lot. This can prove the spread of the situation!</p>
<p>Leprosy is a contagious disease. Although it does not spread as quickly as tuberculosis, it is still very terrible. In the writings of Dr. Bailey, the island of Nauru is cited as an example, saying that in 1920 there were only four people, but by 1928 it had increased to 218 people. In just eight years, there was an increase of more than 50 times, and the speed of spring infection was truly alarming. If we calculate the increase rate in Shanghai using this ratio, the situation is also very similar and very scary!</p>
<p>People in Shanghai only know to pay attention to the spread of lung disease, but they have not paid attention to leprosy. Sure enough, leprosy is not as obvious as lung disease. If we pay attention to it, we will find that among the general vendors, rickshaw pullers, workers, cooks, and servants, there are quite a few who suffer from leprosy but still work among the crowd. These people mostly live in humid and dirty slums, making the spread of infection even stronger. Even ordinary people in society may be infected if they come into contact with them.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a society where people from all over the world live together, and the population is so dense. If we do not prevent it, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, and the consequences will be unimaginable! What is the way to prevent it? There are two major points: assisting the Leprosy Relief Association in expanding the scope of accommodation and establishing general clinics everywhere. However, this matter is huge, and it cannot be accomplished without the strength of the group. The association is currently holding a fundraising campaign due to a lack of funds. All citizens, for the sake of social service, should extinguish the poisonous flames of the spread of the disease. (No remuneration accepted)</p>
<h3>Understanding</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>When it comes to any field of knowledge, be it literature, natural science, medicine, etc., the purpose of exploring and researching it is nothing more than to demand that we ourselves truly "understand" it.</p>
<p>"Understanding" in knowledge is a great driving force that helps you create a career; understanding in moral cultivation is to make you understand how to be a person, how to establish your life, and how to "cultivate yourself, regulate your family, govern your state, and bring peace to the world?"</p>
<p>So, all "understanding is not necessarily as precious as you say!" Then, let me ask you, suppose you are sick, and you ask someone who does not "understand" medicine at all, or a doctor who does not "understand" your condition at all, to treat you, then what kind of consequences should you have?</p>
<p>Let me be clearer; suppose, a military factory hires a group of carpenters or stonemasons and asks them to manufacture airplanes and cannons, then what kind of excellent weapons will they produce, enough to destroy the enemy?</p>
<p>Of course, "learning is not applied," which can make a person with rich knowledge sigh "a hero has no place to use his talents" and fall into the same situation as a person with no knowledge cultivation.</p>
<p>If people do not understand each other, then misunderstandings and disputes are likely to occur. If countries lack understanding, all kinds of disputes will arise.</p>
<p>In addition, a person who does not understand others or himself often acts recklessly like a blind man riding a blind horse. As a result, he will surely incur boredom and suffer all the pain of disappointment.</p>
<p>Human existence in the world requires too many things to understand, but the prerequisite is to fully understand yourself first, just as Sun Tzu's Art of War says: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Then, do your best to explore everything else you need to understand; or knowledge. Of course, you will never have any overly high desires that are difficult for you to achieve at the moment, and then you will never taste the bitter cup of life.</p>
<h3>Humor and Irony</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>In the art of dealing with the world, humor is what you need. It is not a talent, and everyone can develop a sense of humor. Everyone should cultivate humor as a personal trait, which can break your conceit and arrogance, dispel your worries and indignation; enhance your emotions and friendship, and is also a tonic for your health.</p>
<p>Carlton once said: "I often feel that humor is like the oxygen in the air we breathe. It creates and maintains human laughter. It can certainly create other things, but laughter comes first. "What people need is certainly a happy mood. With a happy mind, they can create a happy and fulfilling life and establish any great career.</p>
<p>A humorous word is like a ray of sunshine in dense dark clouds, which can dispel all the shadows of sorrow and fear: a humorous question and answer is the greatest element to eliminate anger and resentment, but it is not a spicy "irony," but a gentle humor that is jesting but not abusive.</p>
<p>When humor is used too sharply, it becomes "irony." "Irony" is the easiest to use, but it is also the most harmful. Sometimes, if used properly, it can increase laughter without hurting friendship, but many ironies contain malice. Now, most people make the mistake of using humor by ridiculing others with rude words without making them laugh. "Irony" is a great enemy of friendship. Although you can win, it can never enhance friendship. On the other hand, because this kind of failure is the most painful, Dr. Johnson once wrote a short poem:</p>
<p>"All the pain that makes people embarrassed, the most unbearable cold ridicule: fate hurts a generous heart, not as deep as the insult of a fool."</p>
<p>Dear friends! Never ridicule others, and don't imitate the appearance of others as a material for ridicule. You should firmly remember that you want to maintain friendship. You should use sincere humor to encourage your friends and use frank humor to handle all affairs, so that humor becomes a powerful motivation and a true art of dealing with the world.</p>

<h3>Who are the Demons Surrounding You?</h3>
<p>— Zi Lei</p>
<p>"My friend, do you have enemies?" When I ask you this, you may be surprised. "What? Do I have enemies? Who are my enemies?" You are thinking this in your heart, and you will probably answer me, "No," you may even say more affirmatively, "Not one."</p>
<p>Really not one? Haha, I have to tell you, but you are afraid, you are already surrounded by countless demons! Who are these demons? Guess for yourself!</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Then please sit down quietly and ask yourself, do you concentrate on your studies on weekdays? Do you have perseverance in studying knowledge? Tell you, your lack of diligence, lack of study, lack of concentration, and lack of perseverance are all demons in your learning. Are you humble to others? Is your attitude kind? Do you often help others? Do you often think about the public? Ah! Your pride, irritability. Your lack of politeness, selfishness, and self-interest are also your enemies. They are the demons in your personality. Are there more? Yes, there are many more! Aren't your lack of attention to hygiene and lack of exercise all enemies of your body? In short, your enemy is yourself, and you yourself are your enemy.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate these invisible enemies and laugh them off. You must know that if you don't hurry to eliminate them, they will kill you. They will make you lose the most precious knowledge and the most loyal friends. They will also lead you from the circle of light and happiness to the path of darkness and pain. What terrible enemies they are! They have the means to kill without shedding blood!</p>
<p>Now your knowledge, your personality, and your body are all surrounded by these demons. Haven't you awakened yet? Aren't you going to break free for yourself?</p>
<p>Wake up! Young friends! Recognize the demons surrounding you and drive them out. This is for yourself, and also for society and the country!</p>
<p>I pray for you, sincerely pray, may you embark on the road of rebirth!</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Primary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund, Mr. Zhizhi Generously Donates 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhizhi sent a letter yesterday, saying: "I have always believed that the most difficult people in society are educators and journalists. We should arouse the attention of people in society and work together to raise a fixed subsidy fund to seek thorough assistance so that people engaged in education and journalism can have a reliable guarantee of life. Last year, I donated 8,000 yuan to your newspaper in the name of a certain society to be used as a scholarship, specifically designated to help the children of teachers and journalists who are unable to study, in order to fulfill my long-held wish. I believe that you also have the same feeling. Now, I respectfully donate 1,000 yuan for the medical aid fund for primary school teachers, and I hope you will check and receive it." (Note: The money has been received, thank you, and we hope that all sectors of society will rise up to donate.)</p>
<h3>Ding Fu's Healthy Longevity Method</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao sent a letter saying: Your newspaper is doing its best to help primary school teachers with free medical treatment, and I admire it very much. Forty years ago, Fubao was a mathematics teacher for six years, and he was also weak and often sick. Later, he used various natural therapies. At the age of forty, he was stronger than at thirty, at the age of fifty, he was stronger than at forty, and at the age of sixty, he was stronger than at fifty. Now he is seventy, and his physical strength and spirit are stronger than at sixty. I know a little about conditioning myself. Now, for the sake of serving society, if primary school teachers suffer from malnutrition, anemia, qi deficiency, neurasthenia, or internal organ diseases, or if injections and medicines are not effective, please go to the Shen Bao office to obtain a medical certificate and come to my residence for medical treatment, which may be cured without medicine. If you can make up your mind to use the healthy longevity method, you will be able to achieve the goal of knowing the disease and being healthy, without being virtuous.</p>
<h3>Requesting Various Schools to Save a Sum of "Graduation Fee"</h3>
<p>The semester is coming to an end, and another large group of graduates will be leaving school, some continuing their studies and some serving society. At the same time, a thick volume of graduation commemorative publications will be published and a grand dinner will be held. Although this is not without meaning, in terms of the current prices, a thin commemorative publication costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; and a dinner costs 100 to several hundred yuan per person; in today's extremely high cost of living, where does most families get this extra expense? Raising money is not a problem, just look at the disaster in North China, and you will feel that this kind of action is too extravagant, and this kind of action does not have much meaning. The price paid is not worth it. It is better to organize a class association to help each other in the future and communicate information. The dinner party can also be changed into a tea party, reducing the cost of eating and focusing on its content and meaning. Therefore, I request the school authorities to stop it and the students to automatically save this unnecessary "graduation fee"! (A student)</p>

<p>Economic Circle Small Comments</p>
<h3>In-Kind Salary</h3>
<p>When we read Chinese economic history, we know that banknotes originated in the two Song dynasties, which are called jiaozi, guanzi, and huizi. The currency system of the two Song dynasties was chaotic, and both paper and hard currencies were inflated. Private minting and printing were rampant, which eventually led to soaring prices and the people were unable to make a living. The Song Dynasty perished. The Yuan Dynasty also widely used jiao鈔 and bao鈔. During the reign of Emperor Shun, due to the lack of national funds, jiao鈔 were issued in large quantities, which also led to soaring prices and great chaos in the country. Military supplies were not enough, and counties and counties all used in-kind transactions. The people regarded鈔 as paper, and the Yuan Dynasty also perished. The Ming Dynasty also used bao鈔. During the Jiajing period, one guan of鈔 was less than three li of silver. The degree of inflation was also very alarming. Prices soared, the people used in-kind transactions, and thieves rose up. The Ming Dynasty also perished.</p>
<p>Looking at the above historical facts, we can see that when the currency system is chaotic, people mostly engage in in-kind transactions. Therefore, salaries and emoluments are also mostly in-kind. In the ninth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, the annual supply of princes was determined to be "50,000 shi of rice, ... 40 pieces of brocade, 300 pieces of ramie silk, 100 pieces of gauze and silk, 500 pieces of silk, 1,000 pieces of winter and summer cloth, 2,000 taels of cotton, 200 yin of salt, 1,000 catties of tea, ... Monthly horse feed of 50 pieces." It can be seen that the in-kind salary system was implemented as early as the early Ming Dynasty, and the in-kind distribution was as many as ten or more kinds.</p>
<p>In recent years, wars have been multiplying, paper money is prevalent, and prices are soaring. People mostly engage in in-kind transactions again. Therefore, civil servants and salary earners who only have paper money to receive are miserable. In order to relieve their pain, the government has already made a decision to implement the in-kind salary system, but the date of implementation has not yet been announced by official order. It seems that it is waiting for the completion of the preparatory work of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>If civil servants can get in-kind salaries as soon as possible, it seems that other salary earners in society also need to rise up and request in-kind salaries.</p>
<h3>Local Goods are Dredged and Transported to Shanghai by the Authorities</h3>
<p>In order to increase the stock of goods and stabilize prices, the local authorities in this city have actively tried to dredge goods, local products, and raw materials from Central China, South China, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and have achieved considerable results. Yesterday, I learned that the goods being transported to Shanghai from the above-mentioned places are quite continuous on the way, mostly belonging to miscellaneous grains and raw materials required by industry, which is not a small benefit to the development of industry and commerce in this city. It is expected that the supply of various goods in this city will increase sharply.</p>
<p>Strict Supervision of Buying and Selling</p>
<p>It is reported that people in the industrial and commercial circles are willing to take the following steps to assist the authorities in reviving the commercial market: (1) Follow the central government's intention to initiate the establishment of trade associations in each industry. (2) Formulate trade rules for industry buying and selling, and order all members of the industry to comply. (3) Establish an evaluation committee to evaluate and set standard prices on a regular basis, and formulate punishment methods. At the same time, personnel will be dispatched to investigate. If any violations are found, they will be dealt with according to the regulations. (4) Be responsible for distribution matters to prevent hoarding. (5) Ban illegal transactions and stipulate that all transactions must be limited to spot transactions.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Floating Transactions</p>
<p>Also, since the authorities ordered the suspension of trading in all industries, general speculators and hawkers have been severely threatened. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, these people usually feel very restricted in their actions, but their intentions are unpredictable. They dare to conduct floating transactions and engage in illegal operations on various quiet roads. It is now learned that the authorities will severely punish these unscrupulous merchants. Once such transactions are found, they will be arrested, prosecuted in court, and punished according to law to deter others and maintain the stability of the commercial market.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest of Wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Purchase and Distribution Banking and Money Industries Jointly Handle Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>The wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has already been harvested. Due to the even distribution of rainfall, all have reported a bumper harvest. The good harvest is rare in a century. It is learned that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has decided to unify the purchase and centralized distribution, and the China Communications Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Shanghai Zhongfu Bank, the Dalu Bank, and the Zhejiang Xing Bank have jointly handled wheat loans. The Japan Flour Industry Federation and the China Flour Industry Federation and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Federation Wheat Group and other institutions have divided the regions and purchased from various producing areas, such as Xuzhou, Wutan in northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The purchased wheat is distributed to flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and other places, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Sanxing, Dongfu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Guangfeng and other flour milling raw materials. Therefore, flour mills in various places have tried to fully resume work after the wheat harvest. It is heard that the first step is to open all the flour trucks and do regular shifts temporarily, and then resume the night shift. According to the estimated wheat production this year, the flour produced will not only be sufficient to meet the legitimate needs of Central China, but also have a surplus to be transported to North China to relieve the people. It is also heard that the household flour in the Shanghai Public Concession, the French Concession, and the urban area will be allocated by the unified flour agency to the Public Works Bureau Grain Administration and other agencies in accordance with the previous methods to maintain the people's food. The amount of allocation will be increased as much as possible within the possible range.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Houses that Subscribe to Grain Bonds can Request to be Underwritten by the Central Bank The Subscription Amount has Exceeded 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the Bankers Association and the Money Industry Association announced to its members to subscribe to the Class A Food Treasury Bonds of the Republic of China in 1942, the banks and money houses have learned that the food treasury bonds are for the government to purchase food, and the purchased and stored food is guaranteed, and the interest rate is set at 4.5%. It is of great importance to the entire people's food. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank promised that if each subscribing bank and money house needs cash, it can transfer it to the bank at any time according to the face value, so as to provide a wide range of funds, and it is allowed to deduct interest in advance at the time of subscription, so it has already subscribed enthusiastically, and the subscribed amount has been reported to the Central Financial Inspection Office. It is heard that the subscription unit is at least 100,000 yuan. Or 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and more than 1 million yuan, totaling more than 100 million yuan, with a part of the deposit cash reserves of each bank and money house as the scope.</p>

<h3>Shen Zhuang's Accountant's Life</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>"Accountant"! This beautiful noun, in the eyes of those who have not personally experienced it, is envied and yearned for by everyone.</p>
<p>However, the reality is not so. The following is my actual life as an accountant for Shen Zhuang. After reading it, you will often sigh and feel chills!</p>
<p>I have been working as an accountant in a medium-sized Shen Zhuang for less than a year. My monthly salary is 60 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons, and I am provided with board and lodging. According to statistics, my monthly expenses are: Laundry, haircut, and bathing cost more than 40 yuan in total. Other expenses, such as broken socks, shoes, clothing, and transportation costs, and because of my hobby, tuition fees for evening classes, the monthly accumulation is always more than double my salary. That is still a personal and proper use, without any slightest leisure use.</p>
<p>The so-called "a rising tide lifts all boats". Prices are rising all the time, and our salaries are always stuck within a certain limit, just like a boat being stuck in a deep pit of rotten mud, unable to float.</p>
<p>Ask for a salary increase? The boss always uses "business is slack" as an excuse, and it is not as desired. Watching the prices of various items in the store rise naturally, the boss earns tens of thousands at a time "without any effort", but it has absolutely nothing to do with us.</p>
<p>If you want to find another way out, there is no better place to go. So, this kind of life of following the old ways is stepping into the path of sorrow and poverty day by day. My grandmother at home is sick! My fiancée ran away... I regard everything as invisible.</p>
<p>The great writer Goethe once said: "Every young person is always dissatisfied with his reality." However, what we ask for is only a stable life. Today's society cannot satisfy even these demands of our lives! No wonder the trend of theft and suicide in society is spreading and becoming more and more serious!</p>
<p>Some people say: "The world is constantly moving forward." Are these progress? Or regression? May wise people in society tell me clearly!</p>
<h3>Egg Industry Association Strictly Prohibits Members from Privately Transporting Eggs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association has long formulated regulations and rules for the unified purchase and distribution of eggs, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Food for approval, and announced that the unified purchase and distribution of eggs will be implemented from June 1. If any members have processed or transported eggs in the interior, the association will purchase them at the original cost price from June 1 to 5, and any overdue will be regarded as private import. Unexpectedly, member Guotai Egg Bank used the name of Guohua Factory to privately transport eggs. On June 5, 48 baskets of eggs and 2 baskets of duck eggs were transported from Wuhu, and on June 6, 130 baskets of eggs and 41 baskets of duck eggs were transported from Dangtu. On the 7th, 60 baskets of chicken and duck eggs were transported from Dangtu, which was learned by the association: it ordered them to hand over the goods to the association, and the association reported it to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Food for verification. It is heard that the association still needs to investigate the facts in detail, and convene a board meeting to discuss the matter and decide on a solution.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Cloth Factory Industry After the Shanghai Special Municipality Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association was reorganized into the Shanghai Special Municipality Cloth Factory Industry Association by the authorities, it has begun to adjust its organizational structure.

<p>Industrial and Commercial Reality</p>
<h3>The Current Situation and Crisis of Fabric Remnant Shops</h3>
<p>— Rou Hua</p>
<p>Fabric remnant shops have formed a major force in the Shanghai fabric industry today, occupying a rather important position. In the French Concession's "Zhengjia Muqiao," "Zhujiaqiao," and "Nanyangqiao" areas, and the Public Concession's "Connaught Road" and "Xiaoshadu Road" areas, the opening of remnant fabric shops is ubiquitous and truly thriving. Tracing back their history, it is still quite short. These types of fabric shops only began to appear around 1920. Initially, their business scope and purpose were specifically to sell fabric remnants from various dyeing and weaving factories after processing and sorting, including "loom-end cuts," "machine oil cloths," and waste fabrics; hence the name "remnant shops," which was consistent with their actual business. These shops were simply organized, financially weak, and operated on a small scale, so they were not initially noticed by the fabric industry. Their initial locations were scattered in areas like Xinzha Bridge, Datong Road, and Sanbanchang Xinqiao Changan Road in Zhabei. Later, Route Foch and Route Republic followed, but at that time, remnant fabric shops in the two concessions were as rare as morning stars. However, because the fabrics they sold were incomplete remnants, as well as wiping cloths, scissor-cut fabrics, and waste fabrics, which factories considered by-products, the purchase prices from the factories were quite low initially, making sales and distribution very profitable. Because of their profitability, more and more of these shops opened. Under the principles of free-market economics, free competition led to a large number of remnant shops competing to buy remnants from the factories. As a result, the prices of remnants rose, and the profits of remnant fabric merchants gradually dwindled. The future of remnant shops, as a result, looked bleak.</p>
<p>However, since the unfortunate incident occurred, the factory areas of Zhabei became war zones, and all the factories were destroyed by artillery fire. Factories in the western part of Shanghai that were not damaged by the war also experienced a sharp decline in production due to various reasons. However, postwar Shanghai experienced a distorted commercial boom. General remnant fabric merchants revived their old businesses in areas like "Zhengjia Muqiao," "Zhujiaqiao," and "Nanyangqiao." Moreover, the remnant fabric shops at this time changed their nature; although named remnant shops, their transaction volume was actually dominated by whole bolts of fabric, with remnants only occupying a secondary position. Examining the name and the reality, they were not very consistent, so they were also called cotton cloth stores.</p>
<p>Remnant fabric shops were fortunate to have benefited from the war period. The value of currency depreciated and prices soared, and every business was able to profit. The price increase of fabrics was greater than other commodities, and remnant fabric merchants with limited capital and relying on patchwork financing made huge profits. Remnant fabric merchants leaped into prominence. Today's prominent remnant fabric merchants were conceived and grew during this period. Remnant fabric merchants became one of the wartime nouveau riche. Most remnant fabric merchants had limited knowledge, and their ability to profit came from being cunning and opportunistic. As a result, they became complacent and squandered money recklessly, spending lavishly without any restraint. However, upon closer examination, their internal situation reveals great fragility and risks. First: Many remnant fabric shops are partnerships, and the partners are often employees of the shop with limited capital. The capital they contribute is often borrowed from various sources, and they have no personal wealth. Second: One of the remnant fabric merchants, as the boss, or holding the position of manager or assistant manager, seems to have transformed, increasing their worth tenfold. After the shop opens, they can immediately reap huge profits, so they arbitrarily engage in unnecessary social activities and spend extravagantly, becoming accustomed to excessive spending and waste. Third: The goods in the remnant fabric shops seem very well-stocked at first glance, but upon closer examination, much of it is obtained through delaying payments, borrowing, and discounting bills. If there is even a slight disturbance in commerce or finance, the first to go bankrupt will probably be the remnant fabric shops. It is hoped that merchants in this industry will cherish their future and seek the normal development of their business.</p>
