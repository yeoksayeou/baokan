<h3 id="c1">日本對華新政策感言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月一日日本衆議院決算委員會席上鶴見佑輔氏提出關於對華新政策的質詢，這些問題，不僅爲日本人民甚爲關懷，而且也正是我國人民所急欲瞭解其眞　的。關於日本當局的意見，已有佐籐軍務局長的詳細答覆（参閱今日本報特譯稿）。我們站在中國人民的立塲，也應縷陳所見，以吿友邦人士，並期待於中日當局的。</p>
<p>第一，我們對於新春以來，日本對華新政策之劃時代的轉變，諸如治外法權之凖備撤廢，租界之準備交還等，都是恢復中日兩國本來能勢而增進兩國民間了解與協力的有力表示。誠如佐籐局長所說：是從中國之奴隸化中加以援手」，這種新政策可能發生的結果，一爲改善中國老百姓對於日本對華政策的舊觀念；二爲對於南京國民政府開始更進一步的信任。因此兩者更可能使中日兩國在戰時的協力更加緊密，並且奠定戰後合作與　榮的基礎。何况重慶政權統治下的人民之「抗戰」的最大理想，也不過是國家之獨立，民族之自由，領土主權之完整，現在「抗戰」五年餘所不克實現的，已在和平區見之，則西南西北各省人民心理上所受的影響，當有不可估計的远大結果。不過，新政策的宣佈，不就是新政策的成功，由宣佈到成功，有着一段相當悠長的過程。在這渦程上還可能遭遇到若干險阻，不問這險阻是屬於日本方面抑爲中國方面，而敵人——英美帝國主義者又是始終在乘隙以圖離間的。所以我們摯誠期待中日當局都抱着堅强的決心和實踐的精神，排除萬難，以期儘速和完全的實現，同時，也必需中日兩國人民之協力與督促。</p>
<p>第二，南京國民政府之强化，這是日本對華新政策實施中必然的結果之一。誠如佐籐局長所說？「從来重慶方面視汪氏一派爲出賣中國者，然因此次日本所取措置，使人明瞭汪氏實爲救中國之人，後世史家，將大　在精衛氏使孫文革命得以結實」。所以，我們可以說，國府强化的前提是已經存在了。佐籐局長所舉中國智識階級逐漸趨向協力，確是事實；但是在　裏我們願意指出一點，就是强化，是在事實上的，而不是在人物上的，更具體的說，是要在力量集中，以期一切良善的政策，都　付之實施而有效果。若只是人的集中，而這些人又不一定具有實際力量，或不一定能發揮力量，那麽，儘管表面上有多少名流要人放棄以往態度，而參加國府，也不一定就會給國府以多大的助力。所以我們期待兩國當局不要爲偶像主義所誤，抱定重事不重人的方針，不問已否參加國府，也不問資格，地位和派系，只要有實際力量，而且能眞正盡力於政策之推行的，就應採取鄭重的態度，而羅致之，並使盡展其所長，才有强化國府的實際效果。</p>
<p>鶴見氏所提幾個問題，固然都有賴於日本政府之更進一步的實踐精神，但同時，却不能不期待中國政府本身的强化，只有一個本身鞏固而强化的政府，才能與日本分任新時代的歷史使命。否則日本單方面的新政策儘管棘變或改善，也不一定會發生理想的效果。而中國政府之强化，則不僅依靠其政策之正確與萬全，特別還要依靠善於執行這些政策的人。日本方面新政策的實際執行者，似乎有一種特別的感觸，即是雖然有着扶助中國的熱誠，與堅决的抱負，而實際所遇到的却是消極與冷淡。我們不是中國政界中人，這種「消極」和「冷淡」，是否爲事實，或只是偶然的現象，不得而知：但在理論上，縱使有這種現象，也不一定很嚴重，而問題的癥結，是在「人材」的問題。中國政府今後如果能中進一步集中各方面眞正的人才，修明政治，革新政風；同時日本對華新政策能切實施行，則縱有少數消極與冷淡者也會改爲積極與熱烈了。另一方面，我們不能不承認在政府以外，還有不少人材，當然主要的是智識份子，有些人似乎消失本能了，實際上不完全有實力，或未能發揮其力量：，有些人是以愛國自居的，在旁邊淸談，指摘政府人選不好，及其施政如何如何，而自己是以洗刷羽毛不入宦海爲「淸高」的。另外眞正的人材，有意避世者固然不乏其人，委曲於不適當的環境中，未克盡其所長者，也所在皆是。我們對於這輩人士，希望都能體認新時代的環境，重新考慮其對於國家社會應擔負的使命，積極盡國民的天職，使在野專才，不致閒散埋沒。</p>

<p>（一）過去百數十年之東洋史，實即爲英美之中國侵略史。茲由日本之協助，中國乃得以取消不平等條約，恢復關稅自主權，治外法權，及收回租界。從中國之奴隸化中加以援手者實爲日本。事變勃發以來，論者多以爲日本侵略中國，美國爲中國而防衛，實際上美國除給與中國若干軍需品與借款之外，其他空無所有。雖亦曾聲明交還治外法權及租界，但僅爲拋棄其已失之權利而已。反之，日本現在不僅不侵害中國之中權與領土權，且進而保障之，協助中國收復失去業已百數十年之領土及主權。中國藉日本之力而成爲獨立國。關于交還租界與撤廢治外法權，業已任命委員具體進行。租界原在外人保護之下，中國人亦安居於此，交還之後，種種攪亂中國內政，革命陰謀等，悉將消滅，國民政府負有維持治安之貴，確信其絕不致於課　稅以困擾人民。</p>
<p>（二）華北如朱深等實際家之當政，即為華北行政趨於堅實之佐證。中國之行政獨立於以完成。新民會中原有日本人千五白人，茲亦加以整理，而代以中國人。使組織簡易化。又原來配置於道縣之日本人連絡官，亦予廢正。中央地方之內政，完全由中國人自行主持。治安向由日本軍隊維持，頗稱良好，茲亦將移交於中國，由現在國民政府治下约三十萬之軍隊與警察同任維持治安之責。固今後政策之轉變，雖在目前戰事方酣中，中國之國防，亦將移於中國人之手，此一事實，深盼特加注意。</p>
<p>（三）特務機關者，原來駐屯各地之日本軍隊，在種種事情上，與中國行政機關交涉之處甚多，如由軍隊各自直接進行，非常困難，乃有此特務機關之設置，處理中國行政機關與日本駐屯軍隊間之交涉事項。因治安及其他諸關係，特務機關除涉外事項外，並亦揷足行政事項，因此產生干涉中國地方行政之弊。此次政策轉變之後，有干涉行政之嫌的事項，悉將由特務機關移交於中國機關，至有必要者亦將先經由大東亞省之手進行。</p>
<p>（四）國民政府參戰之後，日本對華政策轉變之反響，漸次顯現，其第一顯現者爲對於國民政府之反響。從來重慶方面視汪氏一派爲出賣中國者，然因此次日本所取措置，使人明瞭汪氏實爲救中國之人，後世史家，將大書汪精衛氏使孫文革命得以結實。反之，蔣介石政權，自李滋羅斯幣制改革之後，中國完全陷於英國之金融支配下，更因西安事件而變節於共黨，造成中國事變之眞因。今尙依戀於英美之共同戰綫，使中國完全化爲日美之戰場。更據最近情報，中國軍隊在緬甸作戰中受非常虐待，但尙不省悟，爲英國奪回緬甸之甘言所誘，源源驅入中國軍隊於緬甸戰綫。由此事實看來，汪氏之反共和平還　及國民政府之努力，業已獲異常偉大之成果。現在重慶方面之要人及在重慶之外國記者羣，對日本此次所取措置—即因國府參戰轉變其政策之事稱爲「日本之好意的舉措」，而發生非常好感。但日本決不　是好意而已，實即爲日本之眞摯的對華政策本義之實現。結果此等舉措，漸爲一般人所理解，而在中國智識階級之　引起衝動，彼等與日本誠意合作之運動，逐漸抬頭。以前不甚協調之金融界巨頭周作民，唐壽民，吳震修三氏，此次允諾擔任爲經濟委員會之委員，採取支持國民政府之態度。其他與重慶絕緣而歸於國民政府治下之智識階級亦見激增，至不能輕易脫出重慶樊籠之智識階級，亦已漸次引起極大衝動。（翔：譯自三月三日西部每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c23">日本戰時生產陣容　光學工業製造所一瞥　技術工作悉由青年男女擔任 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>從來，像製造光學器械那樣的精細工業，非成人的熟練工人是不能勝任的，然而因着該所所長冲田梅助氏的熱心和少年工人的奮勵，竟使這個不可能的事變成了可能；那兒眞的全由少年少女的手，堂堂地製造出精銳無比的亦可說是日本「陸海軍之眼」的各種光學器械。不用說，在該所裏面也有着〇分之〇的成人職工，然而因爲他們裏面有着好多的雜務工人，所以關於製造的事，不妨說是全由未達徵兵年齡的少年和年輕的姑娘們來擔任的。現在雖然把那許多的壯丁送到戰塲裏去了，但是重要的軍事生產，仍得毫無阻碍地進行着，所以我們是可以安安心心從　戰爭的。又在該所工塲裏受過訓練的少年們，也可說是已成爲一支像他們所製造的器械那樣精銳的兵隊了。</p>
<p>已經是十年以前的話了，當時在柏林旅館裏，曾聽到海軍界裏的人這樣力說：「今後海戰的勝敗，不妨說是將由眼來決定的。」有着那樣重要性的光學兵器，竟由所長先生呼爲孩子的工人來製造，在太平洋裏造成赫赫的戰果，這不能不使人驚異的。</p>
<p>在充滿着酒精和依脫（Ether)氣味好像走進了藥室一樣之感的調整塲裏，姑娘們都在默默地轉動着望遠鏡和潛望鏡。記者也借一架來窺看，只見透過玻璃窗，遠處的工廠以及民家櫛比的屋頂，都現於眼前，那邊照着陽炎的丘陵上的麥田裏，正有人在種麥。抬起頭來再用肉眼看時，則連人影都看不見了。因此這些光學兵器，就被當作眼睛來用，現在天天在華中在華南，去打擊冥頑的蔣軍，在南北太平洋，把暴戾的英美海軍，化爲海底艦隊。如果這眼睛上有了　　，有了溷濁，則勝敗就有猝變之慮。</p>
<p>被稱爲科學與技術之精的透鏡（Leus）以及其他的光學器械，其製造是不能有絲毫的錯誤，絲毫的參差，絲毫的模糊的。製造者非始終有着仔細的注意和不懈的緊張不可。平時最喜歡遊樂的少年們，現在竟肯用其柔軟的神羅知純潔的心情，來發揮其凌駕大人的成績。這種使人驚異的奇蹟，到底是怎樣造成的呢？</p>
<p>那不用說，當然是多靠所長先生的卓見來訓練成功的。所長先生對於那輩孩子，並不敎以廣泛的種種事情，只敎以單純而深刻的技術，訓練的根本，則爲徹底的使知做人的禮儀。動作沒有規矩，就不能製作精巧的東西，然而動作也必須徹底的出諸於心方可，如其只有着形式上的禮儀，則是沒有什麽用的。所長先生以那樣的前提，而把少年們先嚴格地訓練成誠心致禮的規矩。在這種規矩未養成以前，不管幾次，必得一再訓練。所以該所的少年職工，不但是個個有體貌，而且動作不管在那裏，都是從容而有規矩的。</p>
<p>欲使禮儀眞的出諸於心，則非養成敬虔之念不可，故在寄宿裏，都掛著各人雙親的照相，使得保持着父母膝下的溫情。同時每日的生活，必令先對父母致敬而後始。工塲裏除設有神龕外，更於進鬥處掛着安全須知，吉利繩，以及神幣等。該所雖是個製作近代兵器的工廠，然仍使職工等不忘有製作「正宗名刀」的精神。又該所的工塲體操，曾受到厚生大臣的表彰，然而所長先生的目的，不祗在身體的鍛鍊，更在於精神的訓練。故平時不獨注重於體操，更注重於集合，散開等的敏捷與整齊。無論在朝禮後，在下午體操後，一奔到各人自己的的工作位置時，必須先默禱一分鐘，使心神安定，同時對於機具表示感謝之心，然後開始工作。</p>
<p>生活若不良好，便不能製出優良的製品。所長先生以那樣的信念，對於寄宿者給與另用錢的方法，亦經細心考慮，對於日日來回者，則必將發給工資的日期及進退的時刻等，與其家庭取得連絡，以防其發生惡劣的性情。</p>
<p>所長先生關於勸人積蓄一事，是他的拿手好戲。因此，雖然是一個濫用金錢的孩子，一經他的勸勉之後，在三偭月之內，　積儲到一百圓光景。有錢積蓄便會髙興，這是人情之常，但是要積蓄金錢，非勤勞不可，故必須儘力勤勞；儘力勤勞，生活便好。生活一好，金錢便可積蓄。這是所長先生的得意的循環論法。更貼以八厘的複利，益發促進職工積蓄金錢的熱心。</p>
<p>所長先生設法的周到，不只是勸勉職工積蓄一事，更在於燃料啦，電力啦，資材啦等的供給减省而生產並不低落。他在各方面獎勵職工多多硏究，研究出好的辦法，個個表彰，結果就堂堂地成功了把八分的資材作十分的使用之辦法。所長先生自己在去年十二月以來，住入工塲裏之後，就是對於區區一盞電燈，也要拼命努力不使浪費。那樣，照例一到正月，是一個能率低落的月，但是今年的正月，其能率却一舉而提髙了。這是他的敢鬥的成續。</p>
<p>正午過後，記者便想吿辭，忽然有姑娘的亮快的獨唱，從擴聲機裏傳了過來。「這是孩子們午間休息中的業餘演藝哩，」所長先生瞇着眼睛笑嘻嘻地對我說。接着便是口琴聲，再接着便是好像一個少年哼着歌聲走到別處去了，我於是也就含着微笑跟着走出來了。</p>

<h3 id="c24">侵歐計畫失敗 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>（斯德哥爾摩四日特電向後特派員發）綜觀滙集於斯德哥爾摩之各種報道，受着北非軸心軍最近積極的動作所刺激之倫敦，近日盛傳着軸心軍即將進駐西班牙的謠言，疑人疑鬼，喧嚷着必須急速成立歐洲第二戰綫。封鎖地中海而由西班牙所屬摩洛哥攻擊反軸心軍隊，不用說，這對於軸心軍當然有着相當的和益，然而對於軸心軍的那種行動，西班牙果將出以如何的態度呢？關於這點，意見紛紛，莫衷一是。</p>
<p>抱着上述見解的英美，當然就會得出一個必須急速在歐洲成立第二戰綫的結論，這雖是一件談何容易的事業，然而除此以外，要想打倒德國，結束歐戰，在他們是別無良策的。加薩勃朗加會談中最重要的決定事項，究竟是什麽？有關於第二戰綫究有怎樣的最後決定，雖尙不得而知，可是下面的事實，倒是可以明瞭的。即英美無論有何作爲，所望唯在使蘇聯始於單獨對德抗戰，在英美自己對德採取直接攻勢以前，由此儘可能以消耗德國的戰鬭力。不過英美雖希望德蘇雙方同在東綫死鬥，因而把其戰力消耗掙盡，然謂英美把打倒德國的一切任務悉委諸蘇聯，而自己並無任何進擊歐洲之積極企圖，這種結論，則極危險。在英美無寗是只要可能，侵歐之事是勢所必行的，祇因爲欲使其犧牲儘可能减革最小限度，故正在窺伺着機會，這大概是他們的眞情吧。然而至少在目前他們的所謂「侵歐計畫」，由於北非戰局的逆轉而遭遇阻遏，其結果乃有這次關於德國攻勢企圖的種種推測。（丁：譯自三月六日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c42">保健卒譚 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>健康是人人所需要的，沒有健康，什麽事情都不能幹，這一點，上自日理萬幾的國家領袖，下至自食其力的販夫走卒，定有同樣的感覺，所以健康問題，實在是人生切身的一個最重要問題：從狹義方面來說，個人的健康，固然是解決個人以及家庭生活的出發點，但從廣義方面來說，由個人的健康，構成公共的健康，那便蔚成促使社會國家一切進展的總力；因此我們敢大胆地說，人生的健康，是解決一切生活方式和促使社曾國家一切進展的原動力，這大概並不是一局過甚的話。</p>
<p>營養不足的威脅</p>
<p>我們認定健康是人生一個最重要的問題，那麽怎樣來保持健康，進一步怎樣來增進健康，這當然又是一個接踵而來的重要問題，當此生活髙漲，一切營養和衛生，都降落到水準以下，同時一切疾病的增加，却好像酷暑時期寒暑表上水銀柱那樣的劇升，市民的健康，實在已感受到嚴重的威脅，使社會各方面所受的影響，定不在少；同時醫藥的昂貴，也實在使人感到生不得病，所以對於公衆的保健工作，我們不能不認爲當務之急。</p>
<p>保健公司關懷</p>
<p>本市各界領袖及熱心社會人士，關懷及此，本月六日下午四時，特在最近成立的中國保健公司，舉行保健座譚，以期集思廣益，在推進公共健康上，多所貢獻；出席參加的，計有林康侯，顏福慶，丁福保，潘仰堯，黄警頑，劉雲舫，顧炳元，丁伯雄，袁森齋，江一秋，丁惠康，葉善定諸氏，席間彼此就增進市民健康一點，盡量交換意見，情緒很是熱烈，而在各位談話的資料中間，參雜着各人自身健康的經騐之談，也很够社會人士效法，而獲益無窮的。</p>
<p>樂觀養生</p>
<p>這次的座談會，公推林康侯先生爲主席，林氏是六十開外的人，他那堅强的體格，飽滿的精神，堪稱十足的健康典型，在海上諸老中，是不可多得的，在他的談話中間，我們可以概括爲下列幾點：（一）氏從來不生病，可說是一個和醫藥無緣的人，平常也不吃什麽補品，他的健康完全從「飲食小心」而來。（二）氏在六十以後，戒吸捲烟，在應酬塲中，酒也喝得很少。（三）氏有男女公子九位，華封三多，人人艷羨；這回他自己打趣着自己說，本人在五十以後，本廠即停止製造國民工作，引起閻座大笑，同時大家都佩服他五十而斷慾，却是一件不容易的事。（四）氏致力社會事業，一天到晚，非常忙碌，但每日之事每日了，一切都抱抱樂觀主義；以上各點，都是林氏隨便談談的，但我們覺得都合乎衛生至理，是構成他健康的因素，很可給社會人士效法的；林氏談話完畢後，即在中國保健公司檢騐身體，體高計得一六〇生的米突，認爲是很合乎標準的，而他的體重，連衣鞋在內是一二八磅，和一二二磅的標準體重，也祇超過六磅，這二點，可說是林氏體健的標準點。</p>
<p>飲食小心</p>
<p>在座各位中，年齒最髙的，當推丁福保光生，他今年正是七十歲，「人生七十古來稀」，何况他的體格十分强健，鶴髪童顏，精神矍鑠，這是更加値得大家歆羨的，他對於林氏所說的飲食小心，認爲的確是養生致健的要諦，同時還加以申說，認爲一切慢性疾病，也都可從飲食調整上趨向自愈，這是他一向把食物療病的經騐之談，聽說了氏從下星期起，將在每星期日的上午，抽出一些時間，爲保健公司舉辦的健　講座，主講健壽法則，特別注重食養指導，這對於公衆健康，一定是有很大的貢獻的。</p>
<p>瘴氣致疾</p>
<p>丙康藥廠葉君善定，曾在華北華南各大公路旅行，他在席間報吿，南北公路，尤其在華南方面，瘴氣極盛，民衆患病的很多，但自從改善公路的公共衛生和醫藥設備之後，人民疾病，便大見减少，於此可見一切疾病的撲滅，祗要有嚴密的醫藥組織，和公共衛生的增進，都可確收成效。</p>
<p>貧病相連</p>
<p>黃君警頑是一個熱心社會事業的人，領導着許多社會救濟工作，他這次出席座談會，帶來了一個驚人消息，他說因爲在本報辦理小學敎師醫藥助金事宜，確切知道一般小學敎師的身體，十個倒有九個不健全的，因此感到與其救濟疾病於事後的工作繁重，何如防範疾病於事前的事半功倍，所以他希望一般小學敎師們，利用星期餘暇，多到健壽講座去坐坐，多得些衛生知識，來改造改造自己身體，免得人家替他担憂；同時對於保健工作，基於上述觀點，也感覺非常興趣，主張先從宣傳入手，盡量灌輸衛生常識，方法是（一）由醫界熱心人士，分區到各　校作巡廻演講，（二）報紙盡量刊布衛生文字，（三）電台廣播，以期大衆領會，又認爲兒童是國家未來的主人翁，兒童的健康關係國家未來的命運，他有二個獻議：（一）提倡嬰孩健康比賽，喚起一般父母對於兒童健康的注意，（二）四四兒童節，不久就要到了，希望聯絡各大翳院，準備爲全市兒童施行大規模的健康檢查。</p>
<p>學校衛生</p>
<p>潘仰堯君從白忙中抽身而來，接着　言，他對於學生健康，十分關懷，提出三點意見：（一）希望各學校當局於注意學生課業之外，尤須注意學生的健康，（二）營養對於健康，有密切關係，希望學校當局將有關營養文字，列入課本，聯絡學生家長，指導實行，（三）希望學校當局延請醫師，爲學生施行健康檢查，藉以預防疾病，遏止傳染，增進團體健康，鼓起學生在學業上的進取精神，在學校所費無幾，而學生受益無窮。</p>
<p>營養著作</p>
<p>顧炳元博士是研究工廠管理的專家，他新近完成一部著作，是專供一般工廠來做指導工人改進營養的參考，同時，他對於社會全般的營養問題，也正在搜集材料，從事著作，在不久的將來，當可供獻於社會，顧氏對於社會保健工作，認爲必須有雄厚的經濟力量來做後盾，才能普遍推行，他舉出美國人壽保險公司兼辦保健工作的一例，希望引起海上各大大壽公司的效法。非特可以協力推進保健工作，同時對於人壽公司的本身，也是很有利益。</p>
<p>經濟關係</p>
<p>經濟界劉雲舫君就經濟界的立塲，極言保健問題，並非單純的醫學問題，實在是很重嬰的經濟問題，同時也是攸得大家注意的社會問題，因爲社會公衆的健康，是促成經濟繁榮的主因，經濟的繁榮，是社會一切事業進展的根源，其間是互爲因果的，這幾句精警的話，可說是鞭辟入裏，在結束他談話之前，還提出很緊要的兩點：（一）是希望各界領袖組織一個保健協會，來推動一切力量，（二）是由保健機關來執行一切保健工作，這樣的相輔而行，定可收很大的效果。</p>
<p>醫藥負担</p>
<p>顏福慶博士在這次座談會中，有很切實的幾句話，給我們的印象是很深的，他說保健工作，需要大衆的力量來共同推動，他的成效，決非一蹴而幾，現在祇有就我們的力量，做我們能够做到的工作，做一分是一分，不必計行麽功利；同時，在這生活髙漲，醫學昂貴的時候，預防和治療，也應當兼籌並顧，希望醫藥兩界的熱心人士，本服務社會，人類互助的精神，共同努力，設法减輕民衆的醫藥負担。</p>
<p>公醫制度</p>
<p>最後由丁惠康博士，發表意見，丁氏說何為保健制度，就是公醫制度，目的在使一般民衆都能得到醫藥的享受，可是就我國現時社會情形而論，要達到這一點，很覺言之匪艱，行之維艱，所以只有照方才顏博士所說，先　能做到的去做，現在施行的健康檢查，就是我們力量能做到初步保健工作，雖然這是一切保健工作的發軔，但是關係也很大，因爲許多潛伏的疾病，尤其是有傳染性的疾病，都可因檢查而早期發現，因早期發現而早期治療，早復健康，這其間正不知省却社會上多少醫藥費用；同時對於一切傳染病的早期發現，杜絕傳染的途徑，在無形中直接和間接的，也不知省却社會幾多醫藥費用，和其他一切損失；再進一步說，一般工作的人們，因早復健康而早早恢復工作，非但自身受益，阿時還得增進生產能力，也不知爲社會增加了多少的經濟力量，爲國家增厚了多少元氣，此中得失，想社會人士都可澈底明瞭，而共同予以提倡。</p>
<p>末了，筆者懷着熱烈的希望，深盼這種有關公衆健康的座談會，每隔一二星期舉行一次，使社會得到更多的益處。</p>

<h3 id="c51">改善北站進口秩序後之新希望 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 春曉</p>
<p>自本論壇發表改善北站進口秩序專文及社論，和召集社會聞人舉行座談會交換意見後，北站即於上月二十一日起，確切改善進口秩序。凡空身旅客，皆可從正門進入，不復擠在携有行李者之行列，使眞正旅客便利非凡，與先前之情形，大不相同。</p>
<p>本來旅客行列，須排至寳山路上，今則祗排滿半個木棚，較前减少三分之二，使大多旅客能及時乘上火車，早達目的地，不枉費金錢往來：跋涉之苦，恩此此　，誠匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>人類之慾望，本無止境，北站進口秩序旣經改善，便利不少，然尙有欲改善之處頗多：惟此種要求，並非過份之希望，乃確屬實情者，祇需北站當局一舉手之勞，即可辦到，告人當亦諒鑒北站當局管理交通之苦衷，而事實上不得不再來一次要求。</p>
<p>（一）上海爲一大都市，往來旅客，有探親訪友者：謀生就業者：接洽交易者；商量要務者；而旅客出門，多少總有行李，自當排列在木棚之內等候檢查；然檢查時間據筆者所知，仍時檢時停，如上午檢查至十時停止，須至十一時半始再檢查，至正十二時復停止，此後又須至下午二時檢查。由此可知携有行李者，仍如前一樣，得不到一點便利，若運氣不佳者，適欲輪到檢查，因停止檢查時間已到，即不能受檢進站，及時乘上火車，反欲在木棚內携着行李直立數小時之久。故特請求北站當局，希予一直檢查至末班車止，予以携帶行李之旅客，開一方便之門，故且立在木棚內之旅客，大多皆係貧窮之輩，富有者早叫紅帽子，代爲携去檢查送進站內，自己空身進正門，多少便利，若北站能改爲一直檢查，誠如座話會發表之一語：「旅客無分貧富，而叫化子來乘火車，亦爲旅客。」至檢查人員確甚辛苦費力，自不待言，乃祗有多調班而已。</p>
<p>（二）滬杭兩路旅客之進口須應分開，因爲檢查行李之時間，是以將開出之火車時刻而定。譬如十二點正有一班南京車開出，檢查當於十一時半開始，而兩路旅客混在一起，經檢查進站者，當非完全乘南京車之旅客，亦有乘杭州車之旅客；而南京旅客，因排在後面，未能受檢進站，及時乘上火車；杭州旅客到反而受檢進站，惟杭州旅客雖得早進站，然離開登車時間甚遠，各非得宜。若將兩路之進口分開，當可避免此種情形，使兩路旅客均能及時乘上火車，不致脫班，减少擁擠之苦。</p>
<p>（三）行李由紅帽子代携進站檢查，實不妥當。因爲像現在之情形，行李交給紅帽子代携進站，而旅客只能空身從正門進姑等候行李，在此過程中間，難免發生不良現象，雖然紅帽子由北站僱用，當亦經過調查身份，或有相當保證，以防其日後發生不良行爲，但其中難免有不良份子，若私下取出數樣物件，旅客在忽忙中，如行發覺得出，設若發覺，尙以爲被檢查去；而且旅客之心理，往往失物事小，乘車事大，祗要乘得上火車，缺少點物件，尙有何人來作計較。若向其追查，總必有所藉口，若去問檢查憲兵，因行李衆多，如何記得如數，且言語隔膜，亦成問題。請求北站當局准予隨同行李進站，爲防止共弊端起見，在旅客身上可由憲兵親自作一番嚴密之搜查，好在進正門，亦須同樣檢查，而憲兵對於行李中之某物若有疑義時，可隨問隨答，若有違禁品被檢去，旅客亦可親眼看見，確是兩全兩美。否則，北站當局認爲此法不行，請改爲於檢查行李時，准旅客在旁觀看，待檢查完畢，若箱子由旅客將鎖鎖上；，若舖蓋可即打就；然後交給紅帽子携進站去，旅客可再由正門空身進站。</p>
<p>（四）紅帽子代携行李之費用，應略有規定，可分大件與小件，另星不計（如鞋盒等），使旅客有所遵循，或用買票之方法，不致有額外需索。</p>
<p>（五）行李房處應揭示裝運行李價目表，表明在某種重量內可免費，超出重量時應納價若干，使旅容一看明白，不致多費金錢，對車站並無損害。</p>

<h3 id="c53">法屬越南全貌（二） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 越人</p>
<p>（二）從象羣到　法屬越南</p>
<p>遠在西曆紀元前二百十四年，即秦始皇三十三年，安南已見於中國的版圖，稱「象郡」，爲我國著名郡縣之一。至漢初，封秦國遺臣趙佗爲南越王。趙佗於漢呂后五年（紀元前一八三年）稱帝。那時漢人到「南越」的一天增加一天，凡硏究安南文獻者，就不難證實今日安南土人中，絕大部份還是秦漢之際自中國南部移居南越的華族後裔。至於安南人的文化，言語，文字，姓氏，政敎，風俗，都還保留着秦漢的風制，比我國內地保存的還要多些！這是在安南稍久的人所不能不承認的。</p>
<p>南越自漢以後，世爲中國南藩，唐時有一部份地區叛變，懿宗咸通七年（公元八六六年）高駢大破「南蠻」後取交趾。到了宋太祖開寳元年（公元九六八年）安南丁部頷稱帝，國「瞿越」，至開寳六年（公元九七三年）即封丁璉爲交趾王，以交州永爲「外藩」。以後歷經元明淸三朝，雖然時叛時附，但總是叛離的日子很短內附的日子很長，而中國的當局除了接受朝貢以外，並不干涉內政，所以名爲「外藩」，實際和獨立無異。安南的統治者，雖然以漢人的後裔爲多，但所代表的，並不是中國皇帝的利益了。當宋室勢力日衰之際，印度的封建小王國曾一再侵入安南，西南，南部和東南一帶，即中國宋·元·明·史書所稱眞臘，占城，及東埔寨等，都曾一度淪陷。到了十七世紀初葉，明嘉靖六年（一五二七年）莫登庸纂國。原來安南的統治者黎維譓退保東京一區。嘉靖十六年（一五三七）明朝詔討莫登庸，至二十年（一五四一）莫氏降服，置安南都統使司。二十二年（一五四三）阮淦氏奉舊王裔黎寗，重建大越國」。後來復國的功臣阮鄭二氏，聲勢日大，鄭氏據順化，「挾天子以令諸侯，」阮氏據廣南，稱廣南王，實行富國强兵政策，從印度土王之手，收復了南圻，東埔寨等地。到了淸高宗乾隆五十二年（一七八七）年，阮文惠逐走廣南王幼子阮福映自立，同時進兵順化滅鄭氏，逐走大越國王黎維祈，進占東京，統一安南。第二年（一七八八）兩廣總督孫士毅討伐安南，復立黎氏，但不久阮文惠聲勢甚大，到了乾隆五十四年（一七八九）淸廷即封阮爲安南王。嘉慶七年，阮福映東山再起，統一安南，次年（一八〇三）受封爲「越南王」。</p>
<p>內亂方平，而外患荐至。西方人爭奪殖民地的戰鬭，巳在東亞各地演出。法國在印度失敗之後，繼有國內革命和拿破崙的遠征擾攘數十年，不暇東顧，但到了十九世紀的四十年代，又開始其對外經營，十年之後，即在地中海北岸及北非一帶獲得了廣大的殖民地，建立了歐亞交通根據地之後，便積極向東方活動，後印度便成了新的戰塲。而安南呢，因爲本國封建主的連年內戰，把國民經濟和國防實力都自己消耗了，同時，宗主國的淸政府則又在英帝國主義的壓迫和內部叛亂之中，自顧不暇，這樣便給法國以向安南活動的極好機會了。</p>
<p>十九世紀六十年代，法國開始向安南伸展其殖民勢力，到了一八六三年，以武力爲後盾，與安南王朝締結協定，割取南圻六州爲「法屬交趾支那殖民地」，接着又向柬埔寨，東京，安南，老撾各地伸展勢力，一八六四年與柬埔寨王訂約，使柬埔寨變成法國的保護國。一八七三年出兵河內，翌年與安南王朝續締西貢條約，也幾乎化安南及東京爲保護國，雖然因爲中國在安南的革命軍反抗勝利，該約未曾實踐，但一八八二年法國出動大規模的遠征軍，大舉進攻，即於是年八月攻陷順化，迫訂條約，安南本部和東京（即北圻）都變爲法國的保護國。到了十九世紀的最後幾年內，又把地域最廣大的老撾也正式接受法國殖民地當局的保護了。</p>
<p>中國對越南原是宗主國，怎能坐視其投人蠶食。可是，那時正是淸朝勢力，日趨衰微之時，外受列强侵凌，內則自太平軍革命之後，繼以捻回之故，左宗棠方有事於新疆，自顧不暇，遑論邊速外疆？當西貢條約成立之時，不過以一紙抗議，保持「大淸帝國」的一點面子而已。可是，中央雖是昏庸孱弱，地方當局，尤其是邊疆將校中，却着實有幾個賢能熱心的志士，自願請纓。所以當順化城下締盟之後，兩廣雲貴之兵，卽奉召問罪入越。光緒九年底；（一八八三年）法軍由勃里埃勒（Briere）與奈格里盎（Negrien)率領，進逼東京，翌年春，佔領紅河下游，猛犯北寗。六月間，法軍進攻諒山，却被粤桂黔滇聯軍擊敗，華軍士氣大盛。八月二十六日，淸廷突對戰局樂觀，向法宣戰。法軍分海陸兩途進攻，陸軍於一八八五年二月十二日攻陷諒山而馮子材黄孝祺諸將攘臂奮戰，法軍一敗塗地，有在全越總退却之勢，但海軍則進攻台灣，頗佔優勝。但在戰略說，當時法海軍祇在威脅淸廷，初望其作戰到底的决心，實無佔台灣進逼京師的實力。重心還在越南戰事，那時馮子材大捷於諒山，克復越南一省一府一州，法提督奈格里埃（Negrien）重傷，精銳盡失，法國的茹勒（Jules）和弗萊（Ferry）內閣，因此倒台，但淸廷昏憤，竟於光緒十一年四月廿七日（一八八五年六月九日）簽訂中法媾和條約，正式承認安南爲法國的保護國。</p>
<p>法國得到了這擴大的殖民地之後，更蠶食老撾，於一八九三年十月三日訂法暹條約，取得老撾。於是合南圻，北圻柬埔寨，安南，老撾而稱「法屬越南」。成爲法國的殖民地。</p>

<h3 id="c59">經濟譯論　緩和物資移動限制的意義 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>決定在本月十六日起緩和華中的物資移動限制，這是日本對華施策的前進表示，也就是符合撤廢治外法權，交還租界等種種政治上言行的明證。日本的所謂實踐道義政策，就是承認中國的獨立自主，要助長國府的發展，使中國積極地貢獻於完成大東亞戰爭，來擔負參戰的義務。所以日本進一步的放棄了政治上的在華旣得權益，同時在經濟上，也始終抱定尊重中國自主和創意的方針，促進物資的交流，進而再謀上海和內地的經濟聯繫，由於上述的多種見解，才有了這次的決定。緩和物資移動限制，旣是日本施策的前　明徵，它的意義是値得贊揚的了。</p>
<p>昭和十六年十月裏起，在長江下游日軍佔領區內實施的物資移動限制，是要適應因這次事變而產生的特殊事態所施行的措置，當然不應無限期的堅持這種變則狀態。況且中國參戰後所要做的最大貢獻，就是替日本來保衛大後方，供給推行戰爭上所必需的物資，這一種任務，日本很希望能由中國本身來完成，故而不久就要創立全國商業　制協會，網羅上海等地的經濟界巨擘來組織，負責統制中要物資的收集和配給，得爲中國方面貢獻於安定民生，復興經濟，再爲日本方面確保推行戰爭上所必需的物資，設非此舉，實不足以解消因過去之特殊事態而施行的特殊方法。本來大部份的經濟機構，都把日本方面的資　使用於收買內地物資上，這一次的措置施行後，可以打破這種狀態，所以今後在日本的正常經濟活動上，也有不少裨益。</p>
<p>就目前的情形來說，這次的決定，對於日本人的經濟活動上，是不惜重，影響的舉動。像從前一部份日商享受的獨占，排他特權，勢必喪失，不過給予一個和華方同一條件而活動機會。但是這一點犧牲，爲了完成大東亞戰爭和中日全面提携協力的必要，是不可避免的，而且沒有避免的道理。據聞當局抱有推進新政的決心，對於違反這次措置的，決定嚴懲不貸，我希望日商一切謹愼自戒，要懷抱適應新情勢一的理想，弗使當局的苦心付於一流水。（雲鵬：譯自三月十二日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c60">金融業應化競爭為合作 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>據最近保險監理局之通吿，爲阻止保險公司之濫事招徠計，特限制保險代理處之設置。凡在保險公司總分支店所在地不准有代理處之設置，除總分支店所在地外，每處亦只准有一什理處之設置，免致營業競爭，濫受保額，用意可謂深長。</p>
<p>查現在保險公司最大之問題，爲如何集中華商保險公司之資力，成立一分保之中樞。蓋每一保險公司若承保財產，不加分散，則危險過於集中，其患不堪設想！故全賴分保以平均其負擔。現在雖有太平分保集團，大上海令保集團，久聯分保集團之組織，以應分保之需要，然此不過爲合作之開端，更望集合整個之資力，再求密切之合作，庶可負保險業將來之重任，非專事爭攬生意，各自爲政者所能成功。</p>
<p>由是而連想及於銀行之營業。銀行如僅多設幾處分支行辦事處，以爭收多量之存款，謀一時之厚利，而不於正當之營業，求一共同之合作，則猶如飲酖止渴，決不能成銀行之大業。譬如現在提倡滙票之承兌貼現，必須銀錢業一致推行，方克奏效，即其一例。今日經濟社會，正在飄搖不定之中，孤帆庸能漂泊於大海？必有合羣之力，始克有濟，金融業之切要問題爲合作，而合作首貴開誠，開誠首貴免除無謂之競爭。故必化競爭爲合作，方能建立我金融業永久之基礎。</p>

<p>再觀日本內地之金融界動態，在關東方面，三井與第一，三菱與第百四銀行，分別訂有合同，此外安田銀行，吸收合併日本日夜銀行，並擬合併第三銀行。在關西，住友，三和，野村，大阪儲蓄，日本信託，均有訂立合同之意，並擬由銀行吸收生命保險業（即　險業，）俾財界機構得以統一，而經濟統制可合理推進，集全部資金以增强生產，業已成立南方開發金庫，並在大藏省成立金融金庫，正金，台灣，興業，勤業，朝鮮銀行等，必然循此方向而改組。</p>
<p>再觀在華正金銀行之金融動態，在凍結資金之前，賴外匯買賣等項業務而維持日圓滙免市塲，同時供應貿易商之外滙需求，其成績斐然，對於日本貿易界之推廣至世界市塲，貢獻良多，但大東亞戰爭發生後，貿易杜絕，故將業務方針由貿易金融而轉至東亞經濟圈之再組織上，促進大東亞共榮圈之物資暢通，衆認其將在嶄新之理想下以匯兌銀行地位而再出發，故該行之今後經營方針，當循此綫而採取各項政策云。（譯三月十日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c67">當前的上海工業 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 雲痕</p>
<p>過去的一年，上海經濟生活有着顯著的變化，自由放任的經濟是吿終了，代之者是有計劃的統制經濟。這種重大的變化反映於經濟的各個部門中，担任生產部門的工業界，無疑地，是最受劇烈影響的。</p>
<p>當前的上海工業界最感困難的莫過於原料的來源發生嚴重問題。上海一般工業所需要的原料，在戰前雖然大部份是靠國內供給，而一部份尙須依賴國外的輸入，在中日事變發生以後，因爲國內交通的阻隔，運輸的困難，上海工業界所需要的原料，幾乎大部份仰賴國外的供給。太平洋戰事發生以後，外國物資的輸入杜絕，加以仰求於日本的物資，因爲船隻關係頗受限制，原料問題遂日趨嚴重。各工廠因爲原料的缺乏，動力的限制，遂不得不紛紛停工或减工以限制生產。據估計非軍需產業的工廠，僅能維持正常開工率的百分之三十左右。同時工廠的家數和勞工人數，亦激劇减少。據去年底調查，本市工廠計爲一一四五家與事變前之三四八五家比較，計减少三分之二；勞工人數計十二萬人，與事變前之二十五萬人比較，計减少二分之一。</p>
<p>工業生產萎縮的另一原因是產品通常都有限價，而原料則任其自然，因此形成原料貴而製成品賤的反常現象，這促使廠方樂於囤積原料，而不願加工製造。因爲原料的脫售便易，利潤優厚，倘然製成產品後有時反而不能獲得如此優厚的利潤，所以自不得不出於限制生產的一途了。此外上海與內地間經濟上連繫性的日見稀薄，內地農村的漸趨自給自足，也是工業不振的一大原因。</p>
<p>不過，工業生產雖然减少，在戰時景氣的高潮中，物價繼續的上漲，工業調整的比較遲綏，都使工業界在財富再分配過程中，獲得空前的利潤，以數萬元資本而獲得數十萬元利潤者比比皆是。這在表面上好像資本的流入生產事業，以扶助工業的發展；實際上工業界於獲得資金後，是否積極從事生產，似乎還是一個問題。</p>
<p>其次，在原料來源不獲解決的時候，製造廠家往往爲節省物料起見，難以顧到技術上的精良，致品質遜色；而消費者也因購買的困難，祇求有貨，不講品質的優劣，因此工業產品的品質日見退化。</p>
<p>當前的上海工業，不問在量的方面和質的方面，都難使人滿意。就量的方面，工廠家數的銳减，工人在全市人口中所佔的比例很低，工業產品數量的不足供應消費，都是明顯的專實。就質的方面而言，則生產效率的一般低下，產品質素的日見退化，工業家僥倖心理的養成，都足以阻礙民族工業向前的發展。</p>
<p>上海工業當前的病態旣如上述，爲戰時經濟力量的增加，戰後產業的重建，賢明的工業家似乎應該放棄祇求近利的心理，放遠眼光，以提高生產能率，完成生產目標爲他們的前提。</p>
<p>當茲物資移動取締條例公佈與全國商業統制總會設置的時候，我特地把當前的上海工業，簡單地申說一下，藉以喚起民間經濟界的注意。</p>

<h3 id="c72">食糧增產的可能性 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>中國的農業，是集約農業（譯者按：集約農業，即爲以較多的資本與勞力投於較狹的土地以經營農業，目的在增高生產額）。現在的耕作方法，收獲似已達到最高限度。耕地面積，幾乎沒有再使其擴大的餘地。可以耕種的大部份面積，都已在耕種了。縱使有了未經耕種的地面，而加以耕種的話，收穫也很渺少，所以就成了被棄的土地。雖然有着增產這句話，而實際上是一個很困難的問題，一般研究中國農業的人士，老是抱着這種意見。在大體上這些意見當然不錯，可是因爲這一點而立刻發出悲觀論調，似乎估計太甚吧！</p>
<p>我們所見到的地方，還有很多改良農業的餘地，所以增產的可能性，還是存在未動。譬如拿稻作來舉一個例吧！改良秧田這件事，减少種子，延長秧田期間，多揷强靱優良的秧，或者改良肥料，指導施肥的方法，硫黄和豆餅須要正確的指導，弗使偏在不衡，全造很重要的工作。驅除害蟲，設法根絕害蟲，不也是很好的方法嗎？</p>
<p>一說到增產，就提出經營面積問題和化學肥料等等，這雖然是日本人的常識，但是這樣一說問題可以比較容易了解。每一畝的收成，就是江南一帶的沃肥地方，也祗有二石五斗左右。平均的收穫，在一石五斗以下，增產的餘地，正還多着哩。</p>
<p>至於說害蟲問題，我曾經聽見某一個技術者說絕對沒有辦法驅除蟲害。但我以爲未免言之過甚，祗要存心去幹，當心自己的田地不要遭害蟲侵及，同時注意到隣接的地土和近傍的田畝，共同來設法根絕害蟲，也是容易解決的問題。這麽說起來，或許有人要以爲就是因爲華中農村的害蟲而喪失了農村的共同性，然而這是應該認爲對於害蟲沒有關心才發生的現象。</p>
<p>如果能够積極改良種子，供給肥料，建設水利等等的事業，那末華中的農業業生產，一定可以面目一新。但是瑪爾薩斯主義的壓迫，依然存在其間，所以還有一種悲觀論調認爲隨着食糧的增產，人口不免增產，但這是將來的問題，在目前我們所要强調的，就是希望增產。（任：譯自三月十二日大陸新報廣瀨庫太郞原著）</p>
<h3 id="c73">華中的棉花生產 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>自大東亞戰爭爆發後，努力於生棉出產的這種需要非常迫切，因努力加增生產的結果，東亞共榮圈紡織業方面的原料生產是漸漸地達到了自給自足的狀况，在各地區的棉花產額其近似的數字大槪如下：</p>
<p>東亞的棉花生產額</p>
<p>地帶　產額</p>
<p>華北　四〇八九〇〇擔</p>
<p>華中　二二四八〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>高麗　七七六〇五〇擔</p>
<p>洲　二〇〇〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>斐列濱　八〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>印度支那　二〇〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>泰國　五〇〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>荷屬東印度　一〇〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>緬甸　三二〇〇〇擔</p>
<p>總計　八七二一〇五〇擔</p>
<p>按估計，共榮圈內所需要的棉花原料在正常的狀態之下是一五〇〇〇〇〇〇担最低的需要則不過八〇〇〇〇〇〇擔而已。</p>
<p>因此照上表所載東亞各地區的正常的產量是擴大了，這一種擴大而且還是合乎需要的，也正因爲如此，當局更在想法增加日本四〇〇〇〇〇〇擔的滿洲二〇〇〇〇〇擔的中國四五〇〇〇〇〇〇擔的以及南方地區一——四〇〇〇〇〇〇擔的生棉出產。</p>
<p>說到中國的生棉出產，一三九三五三一一擔這個最高紀錄還是在一九三四年達利的，從那個時候起，中國的出產已經漸漸地衰落了，　這祇要看一看下面這個比較的表就可以明白了。</p>
<p>中國的生棉出產額</p>
<p>這　出產的暴落是有各種理由的，地方情形和天然勢力的作祟，也是其中之一。</p>
<p>但是要增加自用棉花生產的基本問題，正在擴大耕種的地域，改良種植的方法以及取消用過度的收買來作爲棉花種植的刺激。</p>
<p>在華中一帶用的棉種主要地分爲兩類：亞洲秤和大陸種。據一九四〇年的考察所得，中國白分之六十的棉田是用亞洲種種植的。用大陸種播植的祇有百分之四，還有一點，我們史須明白，大陸種成熟時期較長，因此，中國的農民，大多不歡喜牠。</p>
<p>華中棉花統制會成立以來，已經竭盡所能地改良了中國的棉質，擴展了種棉的地區，五年的生產計劃也已經訂了出來，在這個計劃之下華中的棉產可能希望達到每年五〇〇〇〇〇〇擔，之數——這也就是這個地區在戰前的正常產量。</p>
<p>和增進棉產，改良棉產的計劃相關的是把揚子江以北的江北發展爲植棉地區。這一計劃是非常値得重視的，因爲這個地帶的土地和氣候是最適宜於植棉的，招引銀行家廠主，和本地的地主投資到江北棉業里去的計劃已在進行了，這個地區是一定會變成華中最重要的產棉中心的，爲着鼓勵投資者起見，負責當局可以自動地來保　投資和合理的利息。</p>
<p>現在實業部正在硏究着，制定着各種計劃來推進和增加中國的棉花產量，在這個工作中，華中棉產改進會所提供的幫助，是有很大價値的，他們正在特別地注意着改進棉花種植的技術問題了。（英英節譯二月六日中華導報）</p>

<h3 id="c77">在艱苦中生活 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 杜鐵</p>
<p>在艱苦中生活，是極不容易的。不如意事十常八九，心理上當然痛苦：因爲經濟窘迫，生理上也陷於營養不足。心理和生理，兩感壓迫；有些人以觀望，企待來安慰；或藉嘆息，怨恨來發洩。這是人之常情，並非少數人的變態。</p>
<p>觀望和企待，對於艱苦是一種安慰，不過這種安慰跟頭痛時塗些止痛油一樣。塗的時候，似乎輕鬆些；過了一會，郤頭痛依舊。</p>
<p>嘆息和怨恨，對於痛苦是一種發洩，不過這種發洩跟傷風時打噴嚏一樣。打噴嚏的時候，似乎爽快些；過了一會，郤傷風依舊。</p>
<p>觀望，企待也罷，嘆息，怨恨也罷，艱苦依舊是艱苦，絕不减少一絲一毫；而事實上因爲觀望。企待。嘆息怨恨，郤躭誤了不少時間，損耗了許多精神；結果，心理上更覺痛苦，生理上更加虛弱；往往一事無成，貧病交迫，以至「抑鬱不得志」而「齊恨以歿」。</p>
<p>孟子說：「天之將降大任於斯人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身，行拂亂其所爲，所以動心忍性，曾益其所不能。」這話並不全是勉勵人做舜傳說等大人物的，對於一般人都適用。明顯地說，除非我們不想做人罷了，否則，就非有應付並克服艱苦的耐性和能力不可。</p>
<p>就生物的立塲來說，不論那種生物，爲了生活，常須忙忙碌碌，盡其最大之努力；何况我們是生活極複雜的人類呢？何況處此空前未有的大時代呢？</p>
<p>不論處境怎樣艱苦，我們必須立定脚跟，擬定計劃，從遠處着眼，從近處下手。一點一滴，實事求是做去。盡量利用空閒時間，訓練自己的能力，培養自己的學識，爲社會爲人羣服務。</p>
<p>孟子說：「生於憂患，死於安樂」。如果我們在艱苦之中，只是觀望。企待，或嘆息。怨恨，就是能倖而度過憂息，也不過是「廢物而已！「贅疣」而已！</p>

<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>—世界著名藝術家的書翰之一</p>
<p>文　送這本書給你的時候，我將我的秘密放在你和尊夫人的手裏，很相信你們一定會將牠當作自己的秘密。這本書是我寫的；在這本書裏，我宣示了和對於人與事物的最內心的見解，並且第一次將我的全部思想槪述了一下。這本書在一個充滿着擾亂與困苦的時期，對於我是一個巨大的安慰，因爲其他一切都已經不能安慰我。我簡直要這樣想：我的所以還活着，就因爲我還能够寫這樣一本書。</p>
<p>我不能不用隱名出版的緣故，有好幾種：第个，因爲我不要妨害我初期著作的效果；第二，因爲這是我唯一的手段，來防止公衆和私人汚辱我個人的尊嚴（爲了我的健康狀况，我再不能忍受這種汚辱）；最後，也是最重要，因爲我希望成功一種科學的討論，凡是容智的朋友們，都可以來參加，參加時更可以不用有什麽顧慮，不會再像我以前有所出版時那樣。誰也不會用言語式文字來攻擊我的名字。</p>
<p>我知道，凡是懷著這本書中所發表出來的觀念的，對於這本書所將引起的反駁，是誰也不會有什麽大驚小怪的。</p>
<p>我的感情正像一個軍官，他不管他們受的重創，已經攻破了一座壁壘；他已經到了城上，展開了他的國旗，即使他放眼四顧，他還是處於重圍之中，而他所經騐到的却快樂多於憂傷。</p>
<p>雖然我知道，有如我所說的那樣，誰也不會和我有同樣的見解，我却還要很自負地想，我思想的時候不是單獨的，却是善與人同的。我有着最奇怪的孤寂之感與羣居之感；也有着一個先驅者之感，這先驅者，只知道拚命向前，並不知道那成羣的武士，有沒有在後面跟上來——實際上，還不知他們究竟生存着否。</p>
<p>後果　這封信並沒有眞的送給瓦格湼。至於那本書，因爲按照出版者的意見，只有作者的名字印在封面上的書才能够賣出，尼采就不肯用隱名來出版牠。因此，尼采又將原稿審愼地看了一遍，將那些要使瓦格湼受到痛苦的話須都取消了。原來寫好的信不送，就送了一本「有人性，一切太有人性，」上面寫着這樣的話：「朋友——現在沒有什麽束縛我們了。我們的觀念甚至是天南地北，絕不相容的，可是我們在此起彼落的觀念競賽上，却曾感到過愉快。』不過對於瓦格涅的觀念，却不能說是客觀的。他要求着禮拜，阿諛，和無條件的忠實。據尼采的姊姊說，瓦格湼在「有人性，一切太有人性」中所看見的，不是別的，乃是「他從前的門徒的離經畔道——更甚的是那個愛徒與天才者的離經畔道……因此這事的影響就等於打擊與侮辱。絕交是長此終古的了。……』尼采是一九〇〇年去世的，在他就要咽氣的一剎那，他精神錯亂起來，看見了他從前所崇拜的人的形像，他輕輕地說：「我很愛他。」</p>

<p>廣義一點說：抽大烟吸毒品也是習慣，賭博冶遊成性也是習慣，而直到現在一般太太小姐們仍在焚香祝禱，拜佛求神也何嘗不是習慣。</p>
<p>惡習慣是慢性犯罪行爲的誘導，牠矇蔽了我們，使之步入錯誤的歧路而不自警覺。</p>

<p>腎　是專司排洩的，在接到一堆廢物後還先把廢物整理一番，假使發現有什麼還可應用的東西（如葡萄糖蛋白質及水分），它就把它們留住送回血中再燒一下。以免暴殄天物，把眞正無用的東西却儘量送到輸尿管膀胱尿道而排出。至於說到熱力，架機器的鍋爐裏燒得太熱難免爆裂，體內旣有大量熱力生出，爲了調節起見，多餘的熱力就化成水蒸汽而從皮孔中發散出汗，同時肺中呼出的氣內亦含很多水汽以幫助調節，</p>
<p>一架機器的工作必須受到適宜的管理，才能發揮優越的工作；人體機器的管理者是『　經』，上述種種現象以及一　　其他生理機能都受神經管理神經在其地位及性質上可分中柩神經和末梢神經，在功能上可分知覺·運動·混合神經，粗淺地說，中樞神經包括覰內的腦子，頸部的延髓及背脊骨裏的脊髓，末梢神經是由中樞神經分出來的一根根的東西，分佈全身而管理知覺或運動；脊髓的主要功能是使軀幹四肢的知覺運動與腦子聯絡，延髓的功能以管理心跳和呼吸爲主，所以對生命特別重要，腦子的功能很是複雜，有許多到現在還未完全明白，但無疑義的它是綜理一切的總主宰，不但全身的動作知覺都受它節制，而我們的意志·思想·情感·智慧等張魂上的現象亦由它統治。</p>
<p>身體和機器不同的地方除了靈魂現象之外，還有『感覺器』和『運動』。機器所需的煤都有人替它照料，但人體却沒有這種福氣，我們必須自己去找尋求取，爲了這目的，我們有眼耳鼻舌等感覺器，用以認識體外一切情形，報吿給神經而再發出命令去作必要的動作以求取生存。求取生存的方法或是積極的尋求食物，或是消極的防衛被害，我們身體的運動就是解決這問題的方法。運動的器官是骨骼和肌肉，骨骼形成身體的架子，肌肉又把它包圍而成飛體；當神經發出命令時肌肉就起收縮，使骨骼跟着移動，於是我們就可利用動作而取得生存了。</p>
<p>可是光是自身生存亦還不够，我們總有死的一天，老機器一天天少下去，須得有新機器一批批來補充，因此我們又有『生殖』的機能。由於兩性的結合，雄性與雌性的生殖細胞在女子體內相合而搆成新個體，再在女子體內發育成胎兒，但這僅是一架略具雛形的小機器，足月生出後還須經『發育『才可逐漸變成一架完全的機器。</p>
<p>最後說到若要强化機器工作的効果，必須時常加油和校察。人體可由外來食物中得到『維他命』，同時體內本有各種『內分泌腺素』（即荷爾蒙），這兩類東西的發現尙還不久。到現在尙在日新月異之中。總括地說，這兩類東西種類很多，有的可促進身體發育，有的調節各種生理機能，有的增强體內工作効果，一言以蔽之都担任着人體機器的加油校準的責任，才能使身體不致常出毛病</p>
<p>上天賦給了我們這樣一架結構複雜功能玄妙的機器，我們都該充分發揮它的工作，而况我們更有着一般機器所沒有的東西——靈魂，我們更應珍惜愛護，用靈魂來駕馭機器，做出一般機器所不能做的工作，決不能把自己養成一架沒靈魂的機器！所以若問『我們怎樣活着？』最好的答案是：『我們以一架有靈魂的機器而活着。』（完）</p>

<p>個人的決心種下了成功的因素。牠在發展事業的進程中不時刺激着人的精神，給他勇氣，使事業永遠地推進着，達到他的最後目標。</p>
<p>有人希望完成一件事情。他雖然刻苦勤奮的工作着，然而還不免要失敗，那就是他還缺少決心。或許他在事粱的半途上遭到了挫折。環境壓服了他的意志。他的勇氣給吹散了，他的精神方面受到了摧殘，於是他以爲前途一定更艱難，成功是無望了。於是他放棄了他一半的成就，頽然放下了他的工作；他是失敗了。</p>
<p>一樁事情永不會順利進行的，常常會有許多逆境在阻撓你。決心克服了這些障礙。牠會加倍的努力，鼓勵人們前進，無異病人在神志昏迷的時候注射了强心劑。失敗是苦痛的。但，在他痛苦的情緒中他會獲得啓示，於是他更加望刻苦，更加勤奮的工作，終於他會完成了他的事業。所以我說，在數次失敗後得到的成功，豈不是由於一個堅强的決心在激動他，使他的事業不致放棄嗎？</p>
<p>所以說只有決心才會成功。</p>

<p>她就不再說甚麽，忽忽地走了出去。</p>
<p>薛鳳春依然坐上賬桌，抽出香烟來吸，面上都是笑容，顯出了他有某種得意。　「崇翁，三小姐今年多少芳齡了？可曾對親沒有？……」楊子傑在問。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reflections on Japan's New Policy Towards China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the first of this month, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi raised questions regarding the new policy towards China at a session of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives in Japan. These questions are not only of great concern to the Japanese people but are also what our people urgently want to understand. The opinions of the Japanese authorities have been detailed by Director-General Satō of the Military Affairs Bureau in his reply (refer to the special translated manuscript in today's newspaper). From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we should also present our views to our friendly nation and express our expectations to the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>First, regarding the epoch-making shift in Japan's new policy towards China since the New Year, such as the preparation to abolish extraterritoriality and the preparation to return concessions, these are powerful expressions of restoring the original potential of China and Japan and enhancing understanding and cooperation between the peoples of the two countries. As Director-General Satō said, it is to "lend a helping hand from the enslavement of China." The possible outcomes of this new policy are: firstly, to improve the old perceptions of the Chinese people regarding Japan's policy towards China; secondly, to begin further trust in the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, both are more likely to make the wartime cooperation between China and Japan closer and lay the foundation for post-war cooperation and prosperity. Moreover, the greatest ideal of the people under the rule of the Chongqing regime's "resistance war" is nothing more than national independence, ethnic freedom, and the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Now that what could not be achieved in more than five years of "resistance war" has been seen in the peaceful areas, the psychological impact on the people of the Southwest and Northwest provinces will have incalculable and far-reaching results. However, the announcement of a new policy is not the success of a new policy. There is a long process from announcement to success. In this process, some obstacles may still be encountered, regardless of whether these obstacles belong to the Japanese or Chinese side, and the enemy—the Anglo-American imperialists—is always taking the opportunity to sow discord. Therefore, we sincerely expect both the Chinese and Japanese authorities to hold firm resolve and a spirit of practice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for speedy and complete realization. At the same time, the cooperation and supervision of the people of China and Japan are also necessary.</p>
<p>Second, the strengthening of the Nanjing National Government is one of the inevitable results of the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. As Director-General Satō said, "In the past, the Chongqing side regarded the Wang faction as betraying China, but because of the measures taken by Japan this time, it makes people understand that Wang is actually saving China. Later historians will greatly value Mr. Jingwei's making Sun Wen's revolution fruitful." Therefore, we can say that the premise of the strengthening of the National Government already exists. Director-General Satō's example of the gradual trend of the Chinese intellectual class towards cooperation is indeed a fact; however, here we would like to point out that strengthening is factual, not on people, more specifically, it is to concentrate power so that all good policies can be implemented and effective. If it is only the concentration of people, and these people do not necessarily have actual power, or may not be able to exert their power, then, despite how many celebrities and dignitaries give up their past attitudes and join the National Government on the surface, it will not necessarily give the National Government much help. Therefore, we expect the authorities of both countries not to be misled by idolatry, and to adhere to the principle of valuing things over people. Regardless of whether they have joined the National Government, and regardless of qualifications, status, and factions, as long as they have actual power and can truly devote themselves to the promotion of policies, they should be adopted with a serious attitude, recruited, and made to fully utilize their strengths, so that the actual effect of strengthening the National Government can be achieved.</p>
<p>The several questions raised by Mr. Tsurumi certainly depend on the further practical spirit of the Japanese government, but at the same time, one cannot but expect the strengthening of the Chinese government itself. Only a government that is solid and strengthened in itself can share the historical mission of the new era with Japan. Otherwise, Japan's unilateral new policy, no matter how drastic or improved, will not necessarily have the desired effect. The strengthening of the Chinese government depends not only on the correctness and perfection of its policies but also, in particular, on people who are good at implementing these policies. The actual implementers of the new policy on the Japanese side seem to have a special feeling, that is, although they have the enthusiasm to help China and a firm ambition, what they actually encounter is passivity and indifference. We are not in the Chinese political circles, and we do not know whether this "passivity" and "indifference" is a fact or just an occasional phenomenon. However, in theory, even if there is such a phenomenon, it is not necessarily very serious, and the crux of the problem lies in the "talent" problem. If the Chinese government can further concentrate the real talents from all aspects, cultivate politics, and reform political customs, and at the same time, Japan's new policy towards China can be effectively implemented, then even a few passive and indifferent people will change to be active and enthusiastic. On the other hand, we must admit that there are still many talents outside the government, mainly intellectuals. Some people seem to have lost their instincts, but in fact they do not have complete strength, or have not been able to exert their strength. Some people consider themselves patriotic, talking idly by the side, criticizing the government for its poor choice of people, and how its administration is, while they themselves are "noble" by washing their feathers and not entering the officialdom. In addition, there are certainly not a few real talents who intend to avoid the world, and there are also many who are wronged in inappropriate environments and have not been able to fully utilize their strengths. We hope that these people can recognize the environment of the new era, reconsider the mission they should shoulder for the country and society, actively fulfill the duties of citizens, so that the talents in the opposition will not be idle and buried.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) Today, the 12th, is the 18th anniversary of the passing of the Founding Father and the National Arbor Day. Throughout the country, in addition to lowering the flag at half-mast uniformly, all agencies and schools are closed for one day, and entertainment is suspended to express condolences. The central government specially held a grand commemoration ceremony at 9:00 a.m. today in the spirit hall of the Founding Father's Mausoleum to commemorate the Founding Father's great spirit of devoting himself to revolutionary theory and the hardships of creating the Republic of China. Civil officials wore national uniforms or blue robes and black mandarin jackets, and military officers wore military uniforms and sabers. After the Founding Father's memorial ceremony, at 10:00 a.m., sacrifices were made in the Hall of Righteousness in the Beamless Hall to the martyrs who sacrificed for the National Revolution. At 10:30 a.m., sacrifices were made in the Guangming Hall of Linggu Temple to the deceased Japanese comrades who aided the Chinese Revolution. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. The details are as follows: At about 8:00 a.m., the Chairman of the National Government led the heads of the various ministries and departments and senior officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment, as well as more than 200 members of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, to the mausoleum. They ascended the steps in an orderly manner. At that time, the morning light was faint, fully expressing the bright future of the Republic of China. The national flags and party flags fluttered in the wind on both sides of the mausoleum, further increasing the infinite vigor. At 9:00 a.m., the grand commemoration ceremony began in the magnificent sound of military music: (1) The Chairman took his seat; (2) All stood in solemn silence; (3) The national anthem was sung; (4) The most respectful three bows were performed to the Founding Father's portrait; (5) The Chairman respectfully read the Founding Father's will; (6) Silent mourning; (7) The Chairman led the members of the Central Committee and the heads of the various ministries and departments to circle the coffin once and look at the remains; (8) The Chairman delivered a speech; (9) The Founding Father's Commemoration Song was played; (10) Wreaths were respectfully presented; (11) The ceremony concluded. In his speech, the Chairman exhorted all subordinates to carry out the Founding Father's will and complete the important task of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. The whole body listened respectfully, and were extremely inspired. The commemoration ceremony lasted about twenty minutes and was completed. Under the leadership of the Chairman, all officials then went to the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine and sacrificed to the National Revolutionary Martyrs in the Hall of Righteousness in the Beamless Hall. After a short rest, the Chairman presided over the sacrifice in person: (1) The Chairman took his seat; (2) All stood in solemn silence; (3) The national anthem was sung; (4) The Chairman respectfully read the Founding Father's will; (5) A bow was performed to the spiritual tablets of the National Revolutionary Martyrs; (6) The Central Government presented wreaths; (7) The ceremony concluded. After the sacrifice, they went to the Guangming Hall of Linggu Temple to sacrifice to the Japanese comrades who aided the Chinese Revolution. The Chairman led the sacrifice. The atmosphere was solemn and solemn. It was completed at more than ten o'clock.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) On the anniversary of the passing of the Founding Father, all circles in the capital held a grand and solemn tree planting ceremony in the Bōluó Mountain area near Qīngliáng Mountain in the morning to commemorate the Founding Father's great achievements in creating the Republic of China and his great spirit. Vice Minister Yuán of the Ministry of Industry, Vice Minister Liào of the Ministry of Construction, President Lín of the Administrative Court, Vice Minister Wáng of the Audit Department, and representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as more than 20,000 students from major middle schools and high schools throughout the city, as well as shop residents, were enthusiastic and the grand occasion was unprecedented. At 10:30 a.m., the ceremony began, and Yuán Yùquán (Ministry of Industry), Xú Shìqīng (Ministry of Interior), Zhào Rúhéng (Ministry of Education), Xǔ Xīqìng (Ministry of Propaganda), Pān Shòuhéng (Ministry of Social Welfare), Chén Déwén (Lingyuan Management Committee), and Lù Shànchì (Beijing Municipal Government) served as the presidium. After performing the salute, Chairman Yuán Yùquán delivered a training speech, which roughly stated that holding a tree planting ceremony here today has two meanings: one is to commemorate the passing of the Founding Father, and the other is to encourage afforestation. He then summarized the afforestation work promoted by the ministry in the past year and the tree planting plan for this year. Then, Lín Biāo and Wáng Xiū delivered speeches in succession. Then, everyone took a photo to commemorate the occasion. The presidium also led everyone to plant trees until the meeting was dismissed at about one o'clock.</p>

<p>Hankou, 12th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese troops occupied Huarong on the 10th, they pursued the defeated Chongqing troops with the cooperation of the air force. At dawn on the 11th, they occupied Sòngjiāpō (12 kilometers south of Lǐyúxū), 16 kilometers southwest of Huarong.</p>
<p>Hankou, 12th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese troops occupied Huarong, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops in northern Hunan, in the morning of the 1st, they pursued the defeated Chongqing troops with powerful units. At dawn on the 11th, they had advanced to Lǐyúxū, the river crossing point of Wángjiāhé, 72 kilometers west of Huarong. They are now fiercely attacking the Chongqing troops who are collapsing towards Wángjiāhé.</p>
<p>Hankou, 12th (Central News Agency) The Japanese air force and the Japanese ground troops who broke into Huarong cooperated closely to bomb the defeated and remnant Chongqing troops everywhere. On the 10th and 11th, they fiercely bombed about 300 men of the 149th Division of the Chongqing troops who had sneaked into Nánshān, 22 kilometers southwest of Huarong, and had destroyed them. According to reports, Nánshān is about 215 meters high and is located on the west bank of Dongting Lake and the Dongshan Mountain Range east of Huarong. It is also a strategic point for defending Huarong.</p>

<h3 id="e5">One Week of Battle Situation of the Japanese Troops Stationed in China <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) According to the announcement of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China on March 12, the battle situation in the past week is as follows: The Japanese Central China Dispatch Army, after suppressing the triangle area of Hubei Province between Yuezhou and Shashi, launched a bold operation to cross the Yangtze River again on the 8th in an area of 300 kilometers. With the close cooperation of the air force, they broke into Ouchikou, 50 kilometers west of Jianli, and Shishou City, 8 kilometers southeast of Ouchikou, on the 9th, and completely occupied Huarong, a stronghold of the Chongqing troops, on the 10th.

Great battle results have been achieved in the vast areas of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces. Moreover, recently, the security forces of the National Government and various armed groups have also actively cooperated with the Japanese troops, and the results have been even greater. In addition, since the 11th, the "Qingxiang" work has been started in the Zhenjiang area.

<h3 id="e6">Loss of Chongqing Troops in Last Spring's Operations in Burma: Report by Du Yuming, Commander of the 5th Army <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) It has been nearly a year since the Japanese troops pacified Burma last year. Currently, the area is actively moving towards the construction of Greater East Asia. Regarding the situation of the Chongqing troops' disastrous defeat in northern Burma last spring due to the fierce attack by the Japanese troops, two reports from the Chongqing side have recently been obtained, one of which describes the situation at that time. One is the operational report of Du Yuming, commander of the 5th Army of Chongqing. What is described is the situation in which Chiang Kai-shek attempted to defend the Yunnan-Burma blood transfusion route to the death, so he specially dispatched his trusted elite mechanized troops as the expeditionary force to Burma, but was crushed by the fierce attack of the elite Japanese troops. The other is related to the situation of the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma, who were forced to flee to India in a mess after their retreat route was cut off after the defeat. The details are as follows: (1) Du Yuming's Defeat Report - On the anniversary of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War last year, the remnants of the 5th Army of Chongqing held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Burma expeditionary force at the Tuodong Sports Field in Kunming. At that time, the defeated general Du Yuming explained the operational process of the army in front of the spirits of the fallen soldiers such as Dai Anlan, commander of the division, and Hu Yibin, deputy commander of the division. "The 5th Army" first clashed with the Japanese troops for about two weeks. After our army held its position for ten days, it finally retreated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese troops. In this battle, Dai Anlan's troops suffered more than 2,000 casualties. The second operation was near Sagaing. Our army used Liao's division to block the Japanese troops' advance in order to complete the preparations for the operation in Pingman. In this battle, our side suffered 2,100 casualties below the battalion commander. The third time was the defense battle in Pingman. This battle was mainly fought by the British army. The Ouna Qiong defended by the British army was captured by the Japanese troops, and the Japanese troops had detoured to the rear of our army by 200 kilometers. Therefore, the defense operation actually failed. The British army and our friendly forces retreated to India or Yunnan under the cover of our army. This operation lasted for more than ten days, and our army suffered 3,000 casualties. The fourth operation was due to the emergency in Daji, and our army's right wing was attacked by Weiluo, so Dai was sent to support Daji. In this battle, our side also lost more than 80 people. The fifth operation was when Lashio was on the verge of danger, and our army was forced to start retreating. At that time, Dai's division had to pass through four highways when retreating, which led to frequent encounters with the Japanese troops. When retreating to the fourth highway, Division Commander Dai was seriously injured. Because he was retreating in a hurry at that time, there was a lack of medicine, and it was the rainy season, so Division Commander Dai died of his injuries a week later. As for the troops of Yu (Du claimed himself) and Liao's division, they retreated to the west bank of the Irrawaddy River, and were also frequently attacked by the Japanese troops on the way, which led to the death of Deputy Division Commander Hu Yibin. In total, our army suffered 9,300 casualties in the five major battles. At the same time, when retreating, it was the rainy season. During the two months of walking retreat, more than 6,000 people died due to epidemics and lack of food. Therefore, the total loss of our army actually reached more than 15,000 people." According to the above-mentioned number of casualties of the Chongqing troops, it is only the loss of the troops under Du Yuming of the 5th Army of Chongqing, and it was made by him to make it public. However, in addition to Du's troops, the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma also included the 6th Army and special forces, so this number is far from the accurate number of losses of the Chongqing troops in that area. (2) "Visit to the Chongqing Troops Stationed in India" A certain military reporter of Chongqing, who escaped to India with the defeated and remnant troops of Chongqing during the operations in Burma, recently returned to Chongqing from India. He once visited the Chongqing troops stationed in India at Xingmen. The following is the latest situation of the Chongqing troops in India published by him. When the Chongqing troops who went on an expedition to Burma retreated in battle, they had to climb mountains and cross rivers to escape because their return route had been cut off. At the end of April last year, when the Axis forces completely retreated from Burma, the reporter was lucky enough to reach India earlier than them because the route taken by the expeditionary force was different from his. Before returning to Chongqing this time, he wanted to bid farewell to a certain unit that Yu had followed in the past, and in order to understand their latest situation, he visited their station in a certain place in eastern India. When Yu arrived there, the soldiers were repairing the roads near the barracks or tidying up the grasslands in several shifts. For daily life, they could get a small bag of biscuits, and the generals also had half a cup of milk and a pack of cigarettes. Now, in order to prepare to recapture Burma, they are actively training, but the training is conducted in the American style, and all the weapons used are made in the United States. The instructor who is currently training the infantry is Colonel Ukabe, and the instructor who is training the artillery is Colonel Yulini. Among the weapons, there is the latest American 75mm howitzer. In addition to the American army, the Chongqing troops stationed in India were the first to use this weapon. However, the Chongqing troops have always suffered from the difficulty of adopting American weapons because the types of weapons are too large. Currently, the Chongqing troops there are under the command of Generals Stevie and both, but they are directly commanded by Liao Shiwei. When they withdrew from Burma, their clothes were untidy, and many were sick, and many died. Although the health of the army has mostly recovered now, there are still about 600 patients, most of whom suffer from tropical malaria, lung disease, and malnutrition. Currently, the chief medical officer is Major Walling Brook of the United States. He is very amazed at the Chinese people's ability to endure hardship and physical strength.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Authoritative Views of Japanese Economic Circles After the Implementation of Restrictions on the Transport and Sale of Materials: China's Economic Revival and Construction Can Proceed More Smoothly <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government promulgated and implemented measures to restrict the transport of materials and established the National General Association for the Control of Commerce, Japan expressed deep anticipation that the economic revival and construction of the New China could be promoted more smoothly. According to an authoritative figure in local economic circles, China's increase in production will continue to progress. In the future, Chinese and Japanese commercial firms will be placed on the same footing regarding the transport and purchase of materials. Therefore, the Chinese side has grasped the management of the purchasing and distribution mechanism for materials within the peaceful areas, which will further ensure public security and stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the National Government's political power will also be strengthened as a result. The Japanese side will also fully cooperate to ensure that China can complete a truly independent and autonomous nation and establish a system of coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan. The Chinese people already deeply understand the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and have been cooperating unanimously. The participation of representatives from various sectors, such as Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxiu, giants in Shanghai's financial circles, in the economic construction of the New China as initiators of the National General Association for the Control of Commerce, is solid evidence of Shanghai's financial circles cooperating with the National Government. The future of the New China is truly worthy of anticipation. Although the transport of some local products and materials is still restricted, this is only because of the special circumstances in large consumer cities such as Shanghai, and this measure must still be taken. In short, due to the relaxation of transport restrictions and the cooperation of China from top to bottom, the prices and currency in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River can be ensured to be stable. This will make a great contribution to the stability of the people's livelihood and the increase in the production of materials in China.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Between the Donets and Dnieper Rivers, German Troops Launch a Fan-Shaped Attack. Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Kharkov. Central German Forces Withdraw from Vyazma. <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 12th (Havas) - Today's German war bulletin stated that German troops broke through enemy lines and stormed into the city of Kharkov, where fierce street battles are now underway. German troops counterattacked in the Orel region, annihilating two Soviet regiments. The enemy forces north and northwest of Kharkov are being pursued by our troops and are now retreating eastward. To shorten the front lines, our troops withdrew from the city of Vyazma last night. The munitions and supplies stored in the city were moved out weeks ago, and important military equipment was completely destroyed before the retreat. In other sections of the Eastern Front, the melting ice and snow resulted in only localized battles.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Soviet Territory, 12th (Havas) - According to reports from the German front lines, fighting has reached the outskirts of Kharkov. After advancing between the Donets and Dnieper rivers, German troops launched a fan-shaped attack on three fronts. Moscow admits that German tanks and infantry forces in the Kharkov area are larger in number, and the situation is urgent. The German offensive uses "circular" tactics, attacking relentlessly wave after wave, exhausting the defending forces. South of Rostov, German forces have also repeatedly counterattacked. However, Moscow claims that these offensives have been repelled by Red Army artillery fire and automatic weapons. In the central sector, Berlin officially announced that German troops had withdrawn from Vyazma, and the center of the fighting had shifted to the Bely region, 75 miles northwest of Smolensk. According to reports from Moscow, fresh German reinforcements have arrived to reinforce the area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas) - In order to shorten the defensive lines, German troops withdrew from Vyazma according to plan. Before the retreat, they destroyed railway facilities, airfields, vehicles, roads, and water supply projects. However, the administrative offices and two hospitals were preserved, and even some medicine, fuel, and food were left behind, enough to meet local needs.</p>
<p>The Battle for Kharkov Reaches Extreme Intensity</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (Domei) - The battle for the major Ukrainian city of Kharkov has now entered its sixth day, and the fighting has become even more intense. According to an official announcement here today, German forces have deployed 900 tanks and numerous infantry troops to fight, with air support, in a fierce attack. The Red Army was forced to retreat west of Kharkov. The fighting south of Kharkov is equally fierce, but official reports say that Soviet troops in this area are holding firm. The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" said today that German forces are now increasing their pressure, and the intensity of the fighting is reminiscent of the initial defensive battles for Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Domei) - The battle for Kharkov has now reached its fifth day. Yesterday, the German side transferred fresh troops from Storo to this area to fight, and the intensity of the fighting has reached its peak. The main focus of the German offensive was originally on the Donets River line, where they repelled the Soviet forces under General Golikov last week. Now, the German forces have transferred their main forces south of Kharkov. Moscow reports admit that the situation is now very tense. According to reports from Moscow, in the fierce battles west and south of Kharkov, German forces are using superior numbers to break through Soviet defenses. German forces are launching large-scale offensives in the Donets Basin and the Great Dnieper region in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The fighting is becoming increasingly intense. German forces launched a counterattack on the Eastern Front, advanced to the central sector of the Donets River, and then moved north and south towards the key city of Kharkov, held by Soviet troops, gradually conducting attrition warfare. German mechanized units and infantry, outnumbering Soviet forces, are disregarding all sacrifices in an attempt to break Soviet resistance. Fierce battles are taking place everywhere. It has also been revealed that German forces are now re-applying the "rolling attack" tactic that was successful in the advance on Stalingrad last fall, using superior numbers of tanks and infantry units to attack in turns, while constantly maintaining large fresh forces on the front lines. Although Soviet General Shukhov concentrated all his reserve forces to defend the area north of Kharkov, these reserve troops had become isolated small units by the time they reached the front lines, rendering the defensive battle ineffective. In order to defend Kharkov, the Soviet side has almost withdrawn a large force from the area southwest of Kursk, leaving a gap in that area. German forces took the opportunity to launch a counterattack eastward in that area. At the same time, German forces in the Orel region are still maintaining their defensive positions. Although Soviet forces are constantly attacking, they are suffering heavy losses. The Soviet command obviously cannot systematically reorganize its troops to participate in the Battle of Kharkov, and can only make futile attacks in this area. This is evident from the fact that the Soviet side concentrated a large artillery force on the northern edge of the Orel region, seeking to immediately move it to a more important area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - According to a report this morning from the Moscow correspondent of the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, the Battle of Kharkov has gradually taken on the nature of the Battle of Stalingrad. The Soviet Supreme Command has decided to defend the city at any cost and is constantly drawing fresh troops to join the battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas) - Last night, officials here stated that a team of elite German soldiers, carrying grenades, charged into the Soviet positions inside Kharkov in vehicles, penetrating 35 kilometers. Mechanized units seized the opportunity to enter, and finally destroyed the entire line of Soviet defense in that section. In another area, a German scout team crossed the river on ice, risking cutting off the Soviet supply line.</p>

The "Daily Express" believes that the German offensive in the Kharkov area has proven that German military strength remains substantial. British experts believe that a second front should be opened immediately.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - Newspapers here reveal that, although there is no official statement, the UK and the US seem to be in contact, preparing for US-Soviet negotiations. The US and the Soviet Union intend to exchange views on current and post-war foreign policies and important issues. The British believe that after the UK, US and Soviet Union exchange opinions, an agreement can be reached among the Allies on various issues related to the future reconstruction of Europe.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - According to a report from a Swedish newspaper correspondent in London, the Allies will hold a conference, the agenda of which, as proposed by US Undersecretary of State Welles and Vice President Wallace, is the post-war policy of the Allies, with particular attention to the reorganization of Europe after the war. Washington and London have exchanged views on this and can reach a common understanding, and then invite the Soviet Union to participate in the negotiations. It is rumored that the US is currently working to arrange a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin. Swedish correspondents unanimously believe that the development of this matter is still very chaotic, and the situation is expected to clarify soon.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - This paper carries a report from a visitor, Buskhard, stationed in Washington, claiming that people in the US capital advocate that Roosevelt and Stalin should meet immediately to discuss major international issues. A meeting between important figures from the two countries will surely promote understanding and be beneficial to both sides.</p>
<p>Stanley Meets Molotov</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Havas) - According to reports from Washington, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, in a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, suggested adjusting the propaganda methods of the US and the Soviet Union in order to prevent a recurrence of the same incidents as the recent publication of his remarks. It is claimed that Molotov expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of American politicians and newspapers towards his visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Havas) - Rumors circulated that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, was being recalled by the US government because of his recent public statements condemning the Soviet Union for concealing American aid. According to reports from Washington, US Undersecretary of State Welles, when hosting reporters today, neither denied nor confirmed this claim, only stating that Ambassador Stanley was responsible for the remarks he made. He had received the full text of the speech, the main points of which were not much different from what was published in American newspapers.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Havas) - According to reports from Moscow, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley recently made a statement criticizing the Soviet government for failing to inform its people about American aid to the Soviet Union. This statement has caused a reaction in the UK and the US. Soviet newspapers today broke their silence and published detailed accounts. Someone asked Ambassador Stanley for his opinion on this, but he refused to answer.</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (Central News Agency) - After US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 10th, he refused to explain the content of the meeting when meeting with a group of reporters, only stating that he wanted to express his views from a constructive standpoint. Furthermore, although Soviet newspapers did not publish a single word about Stanley's misstatement until the 10th, on the 11th, each newspaper uniformly published Stanley's explanation and US Undersecretary of State Welles' statement to the reporters, as well as criticisms from members of the US Senate and House of Representatives. In addition, they widely published dispatches from TASS in New York, Washington, and London, pointing out that government officials in the UK and the US believed that Stanley's statement had created a major obstacle to current and future relations between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Talk by Japanese Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato: The National Government is Gradually Strengthening; Intellectuals are Increasingly Tending Towards Cooperation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>At this critical juncture of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government, in order to adapt to the new situation arising after the National Government's entry into the war, and based on the fundamental policy towards China of strengthening the National Government and promoting China's independence, resolutely adopted measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality, returning concessions, and transferring enemy property of the United Kingdom and the United States. The people are very concerned about the impact on China of the realization of this new policy towards China. On the first of this month, in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi asked the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What is the significance of the new policy towards China? (2) What are the actual measures for abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions? (3) What is the state of public order after the return of concessions? (4) What are the specific measures regarding non-interference in China's internal affairs? (5) What measures are being taken regarding military and special service agencies? (6) What impact will the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions have on the Chinese intellectual class?</p>
<p>Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, replied in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The history of East Asia for the past century or more has been, in fact, a history of British and American aggression against China. Now, with Japan's assistance, China will be able to abolish unequal treaties, restore tariff autonomy, extraterritoriality, and recover concessions. Japan is the one that is helping China escape from enslavement. Since the outbreak of the Incident, many have argued that Japan is invading China and the United States is defending China, but in reality, the United States has provided China with some military supplies and loans, but nothing else. Although it has declared the return of extraterritoriality and concessions, it is merely abandoning rights it has already lost. On the contrary, Japan is now not only not infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial rights, but is further guaranteeing them, assisting China in recovering territories and sovereignty lost for more than a century. China is becoming an independent nation with Japan's help. Committees have already been appointed to specifically implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Concessions were originally under the protection of foreigners, and Chinese people also lived there peacefully. After their return, all kinds of disturbances in China's internal affairs and revolutionary conspiracies will be eliminated. The National Government bears the responsibility for maintaining public order, and it is confident that it will not impose taxes to distress the people.</p>
<p>(2) The fact that practical figures such as Zhu Shen are in power in North China is proof that the administration in North China is becoming more solid. China's administrative independence is about to be completed. The New People's Society originally had 1,500 Japanese members, which has now also been reorganized and replaced by Chinese people, simplifying the organization. Furthermore, the Japanese liaison officers originally stationed in the provinces and counties have also been abolished. The internal affairs of the central and local governments are entirely managed by the Chinese themselves. Public order was previously maintained by Japanese troops and was quite good, but this will also be handed over to China, with the approximately 300,000 troops and police under the current National Government jointly responsible for maintaining public order. It is hoped that special attention will be paid to the fact that, although the war is currently raging, China's national defense will also be transferred to the hands of the Chinese.</p>
<p>(3) Special service agencies were originally set up because the Japanese troops stationed in various places had many dealings with Chinese administrative organs in various matters, and it was very difficult for the troops to deal with them directly. These agencies were established to handle the interactions between Chinese administrative organs and the Japanese troops stationed there. Due to public order and other factors, the special service agencies also intervened in administrative matters in addition to foreign affairs, which led to the abuse of interfering in China's local administration. After this policy change, matters that are suspected of interfering in administration will be transferred from the special service agencies to Chinese organs. Matters that are necessary will also be carried out through the Greater East Asia Ministry.</p>
<p>(4) After the National Government's entry into the war, the reaction to Japan's policy change towards China has gradually become apparent. The first manifestation is the reaction to the National Government. In the past, the Chongqing side viewed the Wang Jingwei faction as betraying China, but the measures taken by Japan this time have made it clear that Wang Jingwei is actually saving China, and later historians will write about how Wang Jingwei enabled Sun Yat-sen's revolution to bear fruit. On the contrary, after the currency reform under Li Zisluosi, China was completely under the financial control of Britain, and the Xi'an Incident led to a change of allegiance to the Communist Party, creating the root cause of the China Incident. Now it is still clinging to the common front of Britain and the United States, turning China completely into a battlefield for the war between Japan and the United States. According to recent information, Chinese troops are being severely mistreated in the fighting in Burma, but they are still not aware of it, and are being induced by the sweet words of Britain to recapture Burma, pouring Chinese troops into the Burmese front. From this fact, it can be seen that Wang Jingwei's anti-Communist peace movement and the efforts of the National Government have already achieved extraordinarily great results. Currently, key figures in Chongqing and foreign journalists in Chongqing have called the measures taken by Japan this time—that is, changing its policy due to the National Government's entry into the war—a "well-intentioned move by Japan" and have developed a very good impression. However, Japan is by no means merely well-intentioned, but is actually realizing the true meaning of Japan's sincere policy towards China. As a result, these measures are gradually being understood by the general public, and an upsurge of cooperation between the intellectual class in China and Japan is gradually emerging. Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxiu, the financial giants who were not very coordinated in the past, have now agreed to serve as members of the Economic Committee and have adopted an attitude of supporting the National Government. The number of intellectuals who have broken away from Chongqing and returned to the rule of the National Government has also increased sharply. Even the intellectual class who cannot easily escape the shackles of Chongqing have gradually been greatly impacted. (翔: Translated from the March 3rd Western Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Glimpse of Japan's Wartime Production Lineup: Optical Industry Manufacturing Plant Where Technical Work is Entirely Performed by Young Men and Women <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In the past, such fine industries as the manufacture of optical instruments could not be competently performed by adult skilled workers. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of Director Umetaro Okita and the efforts of the young workers, this impossible change has become possible. There, the hands of young boys and girls are proudly manufacturing various optical instruments, which can be described as the "eyes of the Army and Navy" of Japan. Needless to say, there are also 0% adult employees in the plant. However, because many of them are miscellaneous workers, it can be said that the manufacturing is entirely done by young men and young women who have not reached conscription age. Although many strong men have now been sent to the battlefield, it is still possible for important military production to proceed smoothly without hindrance, so we can rest assured from the war. The young men who have been trained in the plant can also be said to have become a crack troop like the instruments they make.</p>
<p>It was already ten years ago when I heard someone in the naval world forcefully say in a Berlin hotel: "In the future, the outcome of naval battles can be said to be determined by the eyes." It is astonishing that such important optical weapons are being manufactured by workers whom the director calls children and are creating great war results in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In the adjustment area, which is filled with the smell of alcohol and ether, like walking into a pharmacy, the girls are silently turning telescopes and periscopes. The reporter also borrowed one to peep through. Through the glass window, the distant factories and the roofs of houses lined up are visible. In the wheat field on the hill illuminated by the haze, people are planting wheat. When I raised my head and looked with my naked eyes, I couldn't even see the shadows of the people. Therefore, these optical weapons are used as eyes and are now being used every day in central and southern China to attack the stubborn Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and in the North and South Pacific, they are turning the violent British and American navies into underwater fleets. If there is dirt or turbidity on these eyes, there is a danger of sudden changes in victory or defeat.</p>
<p>The manufacture of lenses and other optical instruments, which are called the essence of science and technology, cannot have the slightest error, the slightest difference, or the slightest blur. Manufacturers must always have careful attention and unremitting tension. The young men who usually love to play the most are now willing to use their soft, unadulterated, and pure feelings to achieve results that surpass those of adults. How is this astonishing miracle created?</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is thanks to the director's vision that the training was successful. The director does not teach the children a wide range of things, but only teaches them simple and profound techniques. The basis of the training is to thoroughly instill the etiquette of being a person. Without disciplined movements, it is impossible to make exquisite things. However, movements must be thoroughly from the heart. If there is only formal etiquette, it is useless. Based on that premise, the director first strictly trains the young men to be sincere and respectful. Before this etiquette is cultivated, it must be trained again and again, no matter how many times. Therefore, the young employees of the plant not only have good appearances, but also have calm and disciplined movements wherever they are.</p>
<p>If you want the etiquette to truly come from the heart, you must cultivate a sense of reverence. Therefore, in the dormitory, photos of each person's parents are hung to maintain the warmth of being with their parents. At the same time, every day, they must first pay respect to their parents before they can start their lives. In addition to the Shinto shrine in the plant, safety notices, auspicious ropes, and Shinto coins are hung at the entrance. Although the plant is a factory that manufactures modern weapons, it still makes the employees not forget the spirit of making "authentic famous swords." Furthermore, the factory gymnastics of the plant have been commended by the Minister of Health and Welfare, but the director's purpose is not only to train the body, but also to train the spirit. Therefore, he usually focuses not only on gymnastics, but also on the agility and neatness of gathering and dispersing. Whether it is after the morning assembly or after the afternoon gymnastics, when rushing to their own work positions, they must first pray silently for one minute to calm their minds and express their gratitude to the machines before starting work.</p>
<p>If life is not good, you cannot make good products. With that belief, the director carefully considers the method of giving pocket money to the residents, and for those who come and go every day, he must contact their families to inform them of the date of payment of wages and the time of entry and exit to prevent them from developing bad habits.</p>
<p>The director's specialty is persuading people to save money. Therefore, even a child who abuses money can save about one hundred yuan within three months after his persuasion. It is human nature to be happy to save money, but in order to save money, one must be diligent. Therefore, one must work hard to the best of one's ability. If life is good, money can be saved. This is the director's favorite circular logic. He also promotes the employees' enthusiasm for saving money by adding compound interest of eight percent.</p>
<p>The director's thoroughness is not only in persuading employees to save money, but also in supplying and saving fuel, electricity, and materials without reducing production. He encourages employees to conduct more research in various aspects and praises each good idea. As a result, he has successfully developed a method of using eight parts of materials as ten parts. The director himself has been living in the plant since last December, and he has been working hard to avoid wasting even a single light bulb. In that way, as usual, January is a month of low efficiency, but this year, the efficiency was raised at once. This is his fighting achievement.</p>
<p>After noon, the reporter wanted to say goodbye. Suddenly, a girl's bright solo singing came from the loudspeaker. "This is the children's amateur performance during their lunch break," the director said to me with a smile. Then there was the sound of a harmonica, and then it seemed that a young man was humming a song and walking away, so I also walked out with a smile.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Failure of the Invasion of Europe Plan <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Stockholm on the 4th) Looking at the various reports gathered in Stockholm, London, stimulated by the recent active movements of the Axis forces in North Africa, has recently been rumored to be spreading the rumor that the Axis forces will soon enter Spain, suspecting people and clamoring that the second European front must be established quickly. It goes without saying that blocking the Mediterranean and attacking the anti-Axis forces from Spanish Morocco would be of considerable benefit to the Axis forces. However, what attitude will Spain take toward such actions by the Axis forces? Opinions vary on this point, and there is no consensus.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States, holding the above views, will of course come to the conclusion that a second front must be established in Europe quickly. Although this is an easy task to talk about, there is no other good strategy for them to defeat Germany and end the European war. What was the most important decision made at the Casablanca Conference? Although it is not yet known what the final decision was on the second front, the following facts are clear. That is, no matter what the United Kingdom and the United States do, all they hope is that the Soviet Union will begin fighting against Germany alone, and that they will consume Germany's combat power as much as possible before the United Kingdom and the United States take direct offensive against Germany. However, although the United Kingdom and the United States hope that both Germany and the Soviet Union will fight to the death on the Eastern Front, thereby consuming their war power, it is extremely dangerous to conclude that the United Kingdom and the United States have entrusted all the tasks of defeating Germany to the Soviet Union and have no active intention of attacking Europe themselves. If possible, the invasion of Europe is inevitable for the United Kingdom and the United States. They are just watching for opportunities in order to minimize the sacrifices as much as possible. This is probably their true intention. However, at least for the time being, their so-called "invasion of Europe plan" has been hindered by the reversal of the North African war situation, and as a result, there are various speculations about the German offensive intentions.

<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. Sir Sinclair, the British Air Force Minister, declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the British Air Force had established a Transportation Department and an Assault Tank Commander. Sinclair also said that it would be a big mistake to estimate the strength of the German Air Force in Western Europe based on the recent German aircraft's performance in air raids on the United Kingdom. There are still many German aircraft stationed in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Responsible parties said last night that British aircraft attacked Munich, and the Baweilioge Public Library was hit and caught fire. It is still burning. The library has 2 million books, and about 25,000 have been burned. A large part of the 50,000 precious manuscripts have also been destroyed. Several ancient churches in Munich and the German Theater have also been destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Yesterday, a British bomber was shot down near the west side of the Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 11th. British aircraft bombed a small city in western France earlier this week, killing 33 residents. Seventeen of them were buried yesterday morning. Archbishop Dubac of Finstin gave a speech, recounting the suffering of the French people from the war.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Bombs British Seaports</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Yesterday afternoon, groups of German fighter-bombers attacked and bombed the port of Hastings on the southern coast of England, dropping many heavy bombs and destroying many supplies and military facilities in the city. All German aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. British news agencies reported that German aircraft bombed London this morning, dropping many bombs and strafing with machine guns. German aircraft were also found off the southwest coast of Britain.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Military authorities announced this morning that German aircraft bombed the Newcastle mining area last night, and a large fire broke out immediately, causing heavy damage.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. It was learned here this afternoon that an air raid alarm was issued in London this morning, but at that time, only one plane flew over the West End of the British capital, and anti-aircraft guns fired. The details are unknown.</p>
<p>German Eight-Year-Old Child Extinguishes Incendiary Bomb</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th. A Haitong News Agency interviewer learned today that a child, only eight years old, lived in the southwestern suburbs of Berlin. When the air raid alarm sounded, his mother was out and his father was at work. He and his sister, who was only three years old, were lying in bed. After hearing the alarm, he immediately carried his younger sister to the air-raid shelter. At that time, an incendiary bomb fell outside, and the fire was bright. His younger sister cried loudly when she saw it, but he was very calm. He took water from the bathtub and poured it on the incendiary bomb, and only stopped after the fire was extinguished, thus preventing a disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e28">The U.S. Seeks Complete Control of the Caribbean Sea <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, 11th. Political observers here say that the recent pressure exerted by the U.S. authorities on Vice Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of the French territories in the Caribbean Sea, is part of the U.S.'s policy of seeking complete control of the "American Mediterranean." The U.S.'s intrusion into the rich Caribbean Sea region began with the Spanish-American War. The first step was to dig the Panama Canal. Since the U.S. regards itself as the owner of the Panama Canal Zone, it must find a way to obtain full protection for its so-called lifeline. The U.S.'s bases are located in Puerto Rico and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. During the last World War, the U.S. took the opportunity to continue south. In 1915, U.S. Marines landed in the two republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo, and purchased a fortress in the Virgin Islands for $25 million (the Virgin Islands belonged to Denmark before 1917). The U.S.'s position has been strengthened. In the past two years, the U.S. government has also tried to expand its influence to Nicaragua and plans to dig a second canal across Central America in that country. However, Central America is mountainous and prone to earthquakes, which has prevented this plan from being realized. In 1933, President Roosevelt came to power and implemented his so-called "New Deal" policy. As a result, the U.S.'s approach in the Caribbean Sea was completely changed. The Marines, who had been stationed in Haiti for ten years, were ordered to withdraw to the country, and the Virgin Islands were transferred from the Navy Department to the administrative authorities. However, with the outbreak of the Second World War, the U.S. again developed towards the Caribbean Sea. Initially, the U.S. exchanged 50 old-fashioned destroyers with the United Kingdom for the use of all British military bases in the West Indies, especially Trinidad, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua. Later, when the Netherlands surrendered, U.S. troops landed on the Dutch islands of Aruba, Curaçao, and Saint Martin and took them for themselves. Thus, the Caribbean Sea, with the exception of the French territories, has become virtually a U.S. inland sea. However, in order to protect the Panama Canal from external attacks, the U.S. government also signed agreements with countries along the Pacific coast of the Americas to obtain some bases in Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. In the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, "stubborn" members still felt that the U.S.'s southward expansion was not enough and repeatedly proposed plans for the U.S. to purchase the territories of European countries in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 11th. "The Daily News" published an article today, criticizing the U.S.'s policy towards the French West Indies Martinique. The article stated that Vice Admiral Robert, the Governor of Martinique, recently refused to receive an envoy sent by Giraud, a French defector from North Africa, and refused to hand over the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" and other French West Indian war equipment. We now know about this matter. It has been found that Guadeloupe and Martinique have virtually no other means of communication with mainland France except for radio transmissions. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the actual situation of France's territories. The French West Indian colonies cannot hope to obtain any assistance from their motherland and are suffering from the great pressure of the American continent. However, at this time when several army and navy generals are willing to join the rebels, Vice Admiral Robert, even though he is separated from his motherland, is still determined to defend France's sovereignty in the West Indies and refuses to receive envoys sent by the rebel generals. His righteousness is so powerful that it will shine through the ages. When the history of French colonialism is drafted in the future, it will surely reveal to future generations the shameless behavior of the U.S. using aid as an excuse to invade and oppress weak neighbors.</p>

<p>Bern, December 12th, Allied News Agency – Axis forces resumed the offensive in northern Tunisia on Wednesday, fiercely attacking the British First Army's defenses in the coastal area west of Settnan. According to reports from the North African Allied Headquarters, the attacking German forces consisted of four battalions, supported by artillery and dive bombers, forcing the British to retreat to three miles northeast of Tamera. In southern and central Tunisia, only intermittent ground warfare occurred. In the central sector, reconnaissance patrols from both sides were active, with several localized engagements.

Pilots reported that bombs exploded among the artillery positions, damaging several guns. Twelve Allied aircraft were shot down that day. The Allied air force also retaliated, attacking Axis airbases near Gafsa and El Aouina in Tunisia, and conducting offensive flights in the northern and central sectors of the front.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, November 11th, Havas News Agency – According to both Axis and Allied sources, only localized activity occurred on the various fronts in Tunisia, North Africa. German and Italian communiqués only mentioned patrols and reconnaissance activities.

<h3 id="e32">Smooth Material Exchange After Independent Control by Merchants; National Commercial Control Association to Be Established Soon; Articles of Association Drafted Based on Regulations; Preparatory Committee Member Lin Kanghou Gave a Talk Yesterday <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The National Government is implementing wartime economic policies, adjusting the purchasing and distribution mechanisms in Central China. This was passed at the 8th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council. It was decided to establish a National Commercial Control Association in Shanghai, and the provisional regulations for organizing the association and the temporary regulations for restricting wartime material transfers were also passed. The government appointed Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xian Lantin, and twenty others as initiators of the National Commercial Control Association. The first preparatory meeting was held on the 11th at the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Jiang Shangda, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, and five others were elected as members of the articles of association drafting committee. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is said that Tang and others convened a meeting yesterday (the 12th) to study and draft the articles of association, which were largely based on the regulations. A second preparatory meeting is scheduled for today (the 13th) to revise and pass them. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, a member of the association's preparatory committee, who, despite being very busy, gave a brief statement, saying, "The National Commercial Control Association is currently in the process of preparation and can be completed and formally established before the 15th of this month. The provisional regulations of the National Commercial Control Association have been promulgated by the authorities, and all merchants nationwide should have a good feeling about them. After the National Government declared its participation in the war this time, it implemented wartime economic policies and, with the cooperation of friendly countries' authorities, adjusted the purchasing and distribution mechanisms in Central China, resolutely handing over material control matters to merchants for automatic handling, which is a reasonable control method and what merchants generally desire. The commercial group leaders designated by the government as initiators of the association, apart from myself being merely a figurehead, are all first-class figures with reputations and real knowledge and experience. The government authorities have deeply pinned their hopes on this for the heavy responsibility of economic recovery, and merchants generally express enthusiastic sympathy. I and all the preparatory committee members will abide by the government's national policy and the people's aspirations, and, based on the regulations and methods, earnestly cooperate and strive to promote and assist in completing reasonable independent control. Under the equal treatment and close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese industrialists and merchants, we hope to achieve stability in people's livelihoods, increased production, and smooth material exchange, contribute materials to the government, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Then, the future of economic revival for both China and Japan and the entire Greater East Asia will be greatly glorious," he said.</p>

However, with the increase in household rations, it is a commonly recognized fact that they will be welcomed by the citizens. In addition, since the 11th, when rice shops started selling household rice, it has been confirmed that there is indeed more white rice than brown rice.</p>

<p>According to a telephone report from Fukuoka, the Fukuoka Prefectural Poultry Federation Hatchery in Dazaifu Town, Fukuoka City, believes that the current average annual egg production of hens in China is only 50, which is very low and difficult to meet general needs. Therefore, they have specially selected white Leghorn hens with an annual egg production of 300 to 360 eggs to donate to China to increase egg production in China. At 9:30 AM yesterday (the 12th), 600 white Leghorn chicks, freshly hatched on the 11th, were transported to Shanghai by plane.</p>

<p>Recently, on busy streets and in neighborhoods, there are often unreasonable groups of young people kicking balls indiscriminately, disregarding pedestrians, vehicles, glass windows, advertising signs, and store signs. Streetlights and power lines are also often damaged by the balls, and children watching often suffer unwarranted disasters. Now, the two authorities, in view of the danger of this kind of activity without a designated field, have decided that if it is discovered again, Paojia personnel can step forward to stop it. If they do not obey, they can be sent to the police station for legal action. Do not show favoritism.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Japanese Ambassador Arita Returns to Post Via Shanghai; Talks in Detail About the Current Situation in Vietnam; Japanese Troops Maintain Defense on the Vietnamese Border; Strength of Overseas Chinese in the South is Very Strong <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Local Report: Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Arita, passed through Shanghai on his way back to Saigon. He is expected to stay in Shanghai for several days and visit Nanjing for inspection. Ambassador Arita met with the press at the Broadway Mansion yesterday and said that during his visit to Nanjing, he may discuss matters with Chairman Wang, General Hata, Ambassador Mitsunobu, and other military and political figures. After the National Government's participation in the war, Chongqing and the Vichy government have effectively severed relations. The presence of Chongqing troops on the Vietnamese border is not a cause for concern, as Japanese troops have maintained a strong defense in the area based on the Japanese-French joint defense treaty.</p>
<p>Economic Relations Deserve Attention</p>
<p>Vietnam's economic and strategic cooperation with Japan is constantly increasing, much closer than when he first arrived in Vietnam at the beginning of last year. This can be demonstrated by the exchange of goods and joint development of resources. The newly established research department of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam will help accelerate the development of resources and facilitate the smooth exchange of goods between the two countries. The overseas Chinese in the South have great economic strength. Although there are fewer overseas Chinese in Vietnam, their economic power in Vietnam is particularly noteworthy. With Japan's vast resources in the South and the productivity of the overseas Chinese there, we will be able to take a big step towards the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the enhancement of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The entry of Japanese troops into Guangzhou's French Concession to curb the anti-Japanese activities of the Chongqing government proves that close relations exist between China and Vietnam in military, political, and economic aspects. Ambassador Arita concluded by saying that during his two-month stay in Tokyo, he had detailed discussions with Aomiki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, and other government officials about issues related to Vietnam, and participated in the deliberations of the House of Peers as a member.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Public Concession Library Report <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In February, the Public Concession Library loaned a total of 16,395 books, including 4,069 Chinese books, 11,724 foreign books, 587 magazines, and 15 music books. The library reading room was used by 7,976 people. Last month, 99 new Chinese books and 112 foreign books were added. The library currently has 2,318 paying borrowing members.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Extra Charges for Hair Oil and Shampoo at Barbershops; Oil is 1.5 Yuan, Shampoo is 0.6 Yuan Extra <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Barbers Association and its members, in view of the increasing cost of cosmetics and soap, have specially formulated remedial measures to offset losses. The following is a transcript of their announcement: "In the past, our industry has provided hair oil (including hair tonic, perfume, and Vaseline) as a complimentary service to customers, without additional charge. However, due to the rising prices of cosmetics and the occasional shortage of goods, members feel that this sacrifice is too great and have suggested remedies to the association. Therefore, it has been decided that starting from today, we will no longer provide complimentary hair oil. If customers specify that they want to use oil, a cost will be charged. In addition, customers who wash their hair must supplement the cost based on the percentage increase in the price of lotion, soap, and detergent to offset the costs. This is a last resort, and we hope for your understanding." This announcement has been posted in barbershops within the concession. According to reporters, under the current price index, barbershops generally charge 1.5 yuan for hair oil for both male and female customers, and 0.6 yuan for shampoo for both male and female customers. However, a few luxurious beauty salons are exceptions, due to their sophisticated equipment and high expenses.</p>

<p>Public Concession trams have been extremely crowded recently. At each stop, those waiting for the tram are packed, and inside, there is no room to stand. To guide passengers, tram drivers, and ticket collectors towards good order and safety, the company has appointed route supervisors.</p>
<p>Number of Personnel</p>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, there are no new facilities in the appointment of route supervisors for the Shanghai Tram Company. The total number of personnel is 50, with numbers 1 to 10 being Japanese and numbers 11 to 50 being Chinese.</p>
<p>Armbands</p>
<p>These Chinese route supervisors are selected from among the young and outstanding personnel serving in the tram company. Each supervisor is issued an armband made of black cloth with white characters for identification. Their service locations are mostly at the various stops.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Since the appointment of the above-mentioned route supervisors, not only can passenger safety be greatly guaranteed, but also the instruction of good order and the cultivation of encroaching habits are particularly important.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Verification of Shanghai Residence Certificates Tightened; Fingerprinting Simplified; Those Without Certificates Must Show Receipt <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau and the Shanghai West District Police Bureau, in order to expedite the processing of residence certificates, have changed the previously stipulated procedure of fingerprinting at the main bureau to direct processing by the various branch bureaus, starting on the 22nd of last month. All residents who do not have a residence certificate or have not yet completed the procedure should quickly apply to their respective branch bureaus. It is reported that the Shanghai West District has already begun checking residence certificates, and those who do not carry a residence certificate will be severely questioned. Residents who have completed the procedure but have not yet received their residence certificate must carry their receipt, and those who have not completed the procedure must carry their household registration certificate.</p>
<p>Iron Gate</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Headquarters has decided to extend the deadline for the municipal police branch bureaus to issue residence certificates to the end of this month, and the district police bureaus to the end of June. This has been announced separately. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the various police branch bureaus in the Nanshi district were ordered yesterday to check residence certificates at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions. Citizens without certificates are prohibited from entering or leaving the Nanshi district, in order to urge citizens in the area to apply for and obtain their certificates quickly and stop waiting.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<p>In the French Concession, in order to make household registration detailed and clear for verification purposes, it is proposed that residents within the concession fill in their citizen certificate numbers on the household survey form, so that they can be checked at any time when needed, and to prevent the traces of spies. This will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3 id="e44">保健卒譚 <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Health is something everyone needs. Without health, nothing can be done. This is something that everyone from national leaders who manage tens of thousands of affairs daily to self-reliant laborers would agree on. Therefore, health is indeed the most important issue in life. In a narrow sense, personal health is the starting point for solving personal and family life. But in a broad sense, personal health constitutes public health, which in turn forms the total force driving all progress in society and the nation. Therefore, we dare to boldly say that human health is the driving force for solving all lifestyles and promoting all progress in society and the nation. This is probably not an overstatement.</p>
<p>The Threat of Malnutrition</p>
<p>We recognize that health is the most important issue in life, so how to maintain health and further improve health is of course another important issue that follows. At a time when the cost of living is soaring, and all nutrition and hygiene have fallen below standard, while the increase in all diseases is like the dramatic rise of the mercury column on a thermometer during the hot summer, the health of citizens is indeed facing a serious threat. The impact on all aspects of society must be significant. At the same time, the high cost of medicine is making people feel that they cannot afford to get sick. Therefore, we cannot but consider public health work as a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>Concern from the Health Company</p>
<p>Leaders from all walks of life in this city and enthusiastic members of society are concerned about this. At 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month, a health discussion was held at the recently established China Health Company, hoping to gather ideas and contribute more to the promotion of public health. Those attending included Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, Ding Fubao, Pan Yangyao, Huang Jingwan, Liu Yunfang, Gu Bingyuan, Ding Boxiong, Yuan Senzhai, Jiang Yiqiu, Ding Huikang, Ye Shanding, and others. During the meeting, they exchanged ideas as much as possible on improving the health of citizens, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. In the information shared by everyone, there were personal experiences of maintaining health, which are also worthy of emulation by members of society and can be of immense benefit.</p>
<p>Optimistic Health Preservation</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as chairman of this symposium. Mr. Lin is in his sixties, and his strong physique and full spirit can be called a perfect example of health. He is a rare find among the elders in Shanghai. In his speech, we can summarize the following points: (1) He has never been sick and can be said to be a person who has nothing to do with medicine. He usually does not eat any supplements. His health comes entirely from "careful diet." (2) After the age of sixty, he quit smoking cigarettes and drinks very little alcohol in social situations. (3) He has nine sons and daughters, and everyone envies his abundant blessings. This time, he joked about himself, saying that he stopped manufacturing national works after the age of fifty, causing laughter among those present. At the same time, everyone admired his abstinence from sexual desire at the age of fifty, which is not an easy thing to do. (4) He is dedicated to social undertakings and is very busy all day long, but he finishes everything every day and embraces optimism. All the above points were casually mentioned by Mr. Lin, but we feel that they all conform to the principles of hygiene and are the factors that constitute his health, which can be emulated by members of society. After Mr. Lin finished speaking, he had a physical examination at the China Health Company. His height was measured at 1.60 meters, which is considered very standard. His weight, including clothes and shoes, was 128 pounds, which is only 6 pounds more than the standard weight of 122 pounds. These two points can be said to be the standard points of Mr. Lin's health.</p>
<p>Careful Diet</p>
<p>Among those present, the oldest was Mr. Ding Fubao, who is exactly seventy years old this year. "It is rare for a person to live to seventy years old," let alone that he is very strong, with white hair and a youthful face, and full of energy. This is even more worthy of everyone's admiration. He believes that Mr. Lin's statement about a careful diet is indeed the key to maintaining health, and he further explained that all chronic diseases can also be cured by adjusting the diet. This is his consistent experience in using food to treat diseases. It is said that starting next week, he will take some time every Sunday morning to give a health lecture organized by the Health Company, focusing on health and longevity rules, especially emphasizing dietary guidance, which will definitely make a great contribution to public health.</p>
<p>Disease Caused by Miasma</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Shanding of Bingkang Pharmaceutical Factory has traveled on major highways in North and South China. He reported during the meeting that miasma is very prevalent on the north and south highways, especially in South China, and many people are sick. However, since improving public health and medical facilities on the highways, the incidence of disease has greatly decreased. From this, it can be seen that the eradication of all diseases can be achieved as long as there is a strict medical organization and the promotion of public health.</p>
<p>Poverty and Sickness are Linked</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jingwan is a person who is enthusiastic about social undertakings and leads many social relief efforts. He brought some startling news to this symposium. He said that because he is handling the medical aid fund for primary school teachers in this newspaper, he knows for sure that the bodies of general primary school teachers, nine out of ten are unhealthy. Therefore, he feels that it is better to prevent diseases than to provide relief after the fact. So he hopes that general primary school teachers will use their spare time on Sundays to go to health lectures more often, gain more hygiene knowledge, and transform their bodies, so that people will not worry about them. At the same time, based on the above point of view, he also feels very interested in health work and advocates starting with publicity and conveying hygiene knowledge as much as possible. The methods are: (1) Enthusiastic people from the medical community should go to various schools in districts to give roving lectures. (2) Newspapers should publish hygiene articles as much as possible. (3) Radio broadcasts should be used to make the public understand. He also believes that children are the future masters of the country, and the health of children is related to the future destiny of the country. He has two suggestions: (1) Promote infant health competitions to awaken parents' attention to children's health. (2) The Fourth Fourth Children's Day is coming soon, and he hopes to contact major hospitals to prepare for a large-scale health check for children in the city.</p>
<p>School Hygiene</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yangyao took time out of his busy schedule to speak. He is very concerned about the health of students and put forward three points: (1) He hopes that school authorities will pay attention to the health of students in addition to paying attention to their studies. (2) Nutrition is closely related to health. He hopes that school authorities will include nutrition-related texts in textbooks, contact students' parents, and guide them to implement them. (3) He hopes that school authorities will hire doctors to conduct health checks for students to prevent diseases, curb infections, enhance group health, and encourage students to be enterprising in their studies. The cost in schools is minimal, but the students benefit immensely.</p>
<p>Nutritional Works</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Bingyuan is an expert in the study of factory management. He has recently completed a work specifically designed to guide general factories in improving the nutrition of workers. At the same time, he is also collecting materials and working on a book on the overall nutritional problems of society. In the near future, it can be offered to society. Mr. Gu believes that social health work must have a strong economic strength as a backing to be widely promoted. He cited the example of the American life insurance company that also handles health work, hoping to arouse the emulation of major life insurance companies in Shanghai. Not only can they help promote health work, but it is also very beneficial to the life insurance companies themselves.</p>
<p>Economic Relations</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Yunfang from the economic circle, from the standpoint of the economic circle, said that the health problem is not a simple medical problem, but a very important economic problem, and also a social problem that deserves everyone's attention. Because the health of the public is the main reason for promoting economic prosperity, and economic prosperity is the root of all progress in society. The relationship between them is mutually causal. These few insightful words can be said to be incisive. Before ending his speech, he also put forward two very important points: (1) It is hoped that leaders from all walks of life will organize a health association to promote all forces. (2) Health agencies should carry out all health work. Such mutual assistance will definitely achieve great results.</p>
<p>Medical Burden</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Fuqing had a few very practical words in this symposium that left a deep impression on us. He said that health work requires the joint promotion of the power of the public. Its effectiveness will definitely not be achieved overnight. Now we can only do what we can do with our power, do as much as we can, and do not have to worry about what kind of benefits; at the same time, in this time of high cost of living and expensive medicine, prevention and treatment should also be considered together. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from both the medical and pharmaceutical communities will work together to reduce the medical burden on the people in the spirit of serving society and human mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Public Medical System</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Ding Huikang expressed his opinion. Mr. Ding said that the health system is the public medical system, and the purpose is to enable the general public to enjoy medical care. However, in terms of the current social situation in our country, it is very difficult to achieve this. Therefore, we can only do what we can do first, as Dr. Yan said. The health check that is now being implemented is the preliminary health work that we can do. Although this is the beginning of all health work, it is also very important. Because many latent diseases, especially infectious diseases, can be detected early by examination, and treated early by early detection, and recovered early. This does not know how much medical expenses are saved on society; at the same time, for the early detection of all infectious diseases, the prevention of the spread of infection, directly and indirectly, I do not know how much medical expenses and other losses are saved on society; to go a step further, the general working people, because of early recovery and early return to work, not only benefit themselves, but also increase productivity, I do not know how much economic power is added to society, and how much vitality is increased to the country. The gains and losses in this, I think the social people can thoroughly understand and jointly promote.</p>
<p>Finally, with ardent hope, the author deeply hopes that this kind of symposium on public health will be held once every one or two weeks, so that society can get more benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Yesterday, All Sectors Solemnly Held a Memorial Ceremony for the Death of the National Father; Comply with the Bequests and Devote to the Duty; the Baojia Youth Department Paraded <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the 18th anniversary of the death of the National Father. All institutions and organizations in this city, in order to commemorate the revolutionary spirit of the National Father and the great achievements of creating the Republic of China, were all closed for one day to forever admire him and held memorial ceremonies. All shops and households also flew flags at half-mast for commemoration. In addition to holding memorial ceremonies, all levels of schools had the principals recount the great achievements of the National Father and the situation of his death at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. They also gathered all the teachers and students to hold tree planting ceremonies in accordance with the regulations of the National Government. The municipal government and its affiliated bureaus and offices, as well as the Qingxiang Branch of the Security Command, jointly held a memorial ceremony and then held a tree planting ceremony. The Municipal Police Bureau and the police authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent villains and traitors from taking the opportunity to become active and hindering public security, stepped up security and increased patrols at the road crossings and key roads of the concessions. Patrol teams and garrison teams were all dispatched to patrol public places to ensure public security. The details of each situation are recorded as follows,</p>
<p>Municipal Government Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>The municipal government held a memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium. Those who attended included Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, all councilors, bureau chiefs, and more than 300 staff members from the Qingxiang Branch of the Security Command and various bureaus and offices of the municipal government. The four sides of the municipal government were full of commemorative slogans, and two national flags were hung at the big entrance. A cross-street banner on the side of Zhaofeng Park Bailinan Road read "National Father's Death Anniversary Tree Planting Ceremony" in black characters on white cloth. The ceremony was held on time, presided over by Secretary-General Zhao, who led the participants to perform the ceremony according to the rituals. He then gave a speech, which lasted half an hour before the meeting was dismissed. After the meeting, a tree planting ceremony was held in the square behind the municipal government. All officials personally planted a tree, and after the ceremony, they took photos and the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>Youth Department Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>In order to express commemoration and continue the spirit of the National Father's great fearlessness, the Public Concession Baojia Youth Department held morning exercises at 7:30 AM, full of energy. At 8:00 AM, a memorial ceremony was held, accompanied by the Shanghai Municipal Council band. (1) Raising the national flag. (2) Raising the regimental flag. (3) Bowing three times to the portrait of the National Father. (4) Singing the national anthem. (5) Silence. (6) Admonition. (7) Ceremony completed. The ceremony was quite solemn. Peng Zhijian, the minister of the department, gave an admonition, roughly saying, "Today is the anniversary of the death of the National Father. Holding a memorial ceremony and starting to serve the community is of very profound and solemn significance. Regarding the issue of service, we young people are a young group and have been trained. We should serve the community. We should recognize how to be a human being. We should know that the National Father has struggled for more than 40 years for the revolutionary movement, the spirit of great fearlessness, and the spirit of selfless devotion, which have given us a deep impression. We should continue to struggle, holding the National Father's great spirit, and do something meaningful for the country and society. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of our compatriots? We must move forward bravely towards a bright future," he said.</p>
<p>Departure for Parade after the Ceremony</p>
<p>Immediately after the ceremony, the parade began. A total of 1,230 members participated, led by the police station's motorbikes, followed by a parade flag with the words "Commemorate the National Father's Death Anniversary and Start Serving the Community" written on it. Behind it were the bicycle team, the Shanghai Municipal Council band, the department's national flag, the head and deputy heads, the commander-in-chief, section chiefs, and staff. Next were the Central District, Laozha District, Chengdu District, Xinzha District, Jing'an District, Gordon District, and Pudu District. Each district was arranged in order of class. The parade route was from the racecourse, out of the Ma Road Gate, through the racecourse road, turning into Chaqing Road, Fuzhou Road, the Bund, turning into Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and the same racecourse. Along the way, they sang the regimental song loudly, and the line was quite orderly. The traffic was maintained by the self-police corps and police officers from each district, so the order was quite good. After returning to the racecourse, they gathered again, and each district dispersed in order.</p>

<p>Regarding the fuel problem in this city, after the authorities have actively tried to dredge the source, it has now entered the right track. The registration of coal stock by Da Zhonglian Coal Company ended as scheduled on the 10th of this month. The amount of registration will be announced to the public by the company within days. It is now rushing to prepare statistics and plans to fill in the Shanghai Coal Association for record on the date. However, if the coal merchants holding the goods have not registered in accordance with the regulations, the coal shall not be moved. And the authorities will discuss the method and give appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Coal is Sold According to Regulations</p>
<p>Shanghai press reporter learned from the coal industry yesterday that after the authorities successively adopted strict measures and effectively managed the coal merchants' sales, various illegal situations seem to have disappeared. At present, the smoke and white coal have been sold according to regulations. However, the Shanghai Coal Association is determined to adhere to its original intention and unite various coal industry associations to strictly supervise and manage, in order to make the entire fuel market in this city more stable.</p>
<p>Charcoal Stagnant Sales and Stable Market</p>
<p>The reporter also learned from the charcoal industry that the daily needs of residents and various industries for charcoal have also been quite strong in recent years. At the same time, because the market price is higher than in the past, citizens have saved the use, so sales have turned sluggish. Under the situation of stagnant sales, the market is very stable, and the inventory has increased. Moreover, the delivery of goods has never been interrupted, so the spot goods on the market recently are very abundant.</p>

<p>Huang Ronghui, the Cantonese director of Hui Guang Real Estate Company, is a wealthy Guangdong merchant. His family lives in the Huang Mansion at a certain number on Da Xi Road. He loves hygiene and sports, exercises his body, and has a good horse. Every morning at six o'clock, he gets up, has some snacks, milk, and bread, and then orders a groom to lead the horse out for him to ride in the fresh air of Da Xi Road, Yiding Pan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and other places for two hours before returning to the mansion. However, on the morning of June 22nd of the 29th year of the Republic of China, while riding his horse, he was confronted by several bandits along the way who brandished handguns, threatened Huang, and dragged him off the horse.</p>
<p>Implementation of Kidnapping</p>
<p>He was hidden in a pre-rented bungalow in Shanghai's West district, which served as the hideout of the bandit leader and was imprisoned. They sent a letter to his family, demanding a huge ransom of one million yuan. They sent bandits several times to negotiate, and the lowest ransom was 500,000 yuan. However, Huang's family could not afford it and delayed the negotiations, angering the bandit leader, who strangled Huang with a cloth belt and threw his body into the wilderness. At this time, the weather was hot and easy to corrupt. Later, the family got the news, posted a reward in the newspaper, offered 50,000 yuan, and reported to the police station. The police arrested four accomplices in the case, Sun Zhirong, Cao Guilin, Rui Jinbiao, and Wang Zhong, all from Jiangbei. As a result, these people confessed that there was also a wealthy merchant, Fang Yixian, the director of the Samsung toothpaste company from Changzhou, who was kidnapped on Columbia Road a few days later.</p>
<p>Hideout in Shanghai's West district</p>
<p>Because the ransom was too large and they could not afford to pay it, they were also killed and their bodies could not be found by their families. Sun Zhirong and Cao Guilin were sentenced to death, and Rui Jinbiao and Wang Zhong were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were serving their sentences in the Huade Road Prison. Sun and Cao had not yet been executed, but Sun suddenly said in prison that a fellow bandit, Chen Si, knew where Huang Ronghui's body was. The detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, who were handling the case, re-extracted the four criminals, Sun, etc., from the court. However, Rui Jinbiao suddenly fell ill and died. Chen Si, the bandit, was questioned in court and also did not know the location of Huang Ronghui's body.</p>
<p>Where Exactly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sun and Cao were supposed to be sent to the Dilie Court execution ground for hanging. However, because the most important thing in the case, the bodies of the two hostages, Huang and Fang, could not be found, the judge came to the court and announced that the case would be postponed and reopened for debate. He also ordered these criminals to truthfully explain the kidnapping of Huang and Fang and the whereabouts of the two bodies, but still no clues were found.</p>

<p>The rubber manufacturing industry and sales companies in this city, because of the relationship between raw materials and supply, have long implemented a method of purchasing galoshes with certificates on rainy days. Purchasing sneakers and running shoes on sunny days was temporarily suspended. Later, a method of exchanging old shoes for galoshes was implemented. Recently, according to reports from the Shenwen News Agency, these manufacturers are now implementing a method of selling sneakers and running shoes with citizen certificates on sunny days, exchanging old shoes for new ones. For example, the Dahua Rubber Factory's retail department has recently issued a notice and method: A) Notice: "From now on, if you need to buy Shuangqian brand shoes, you must hand in your old rubber shoes that are no longer usable before you can exchange them for new shoes. Please pay attention." B) Method: "1. You must have a housing tax ticket for the summer of the Public Concession, the March-April period of the French Concession, or the spring of the municipal area in the 31st year of the Republic of China, and a corresponding citizen certificate before you can buy galoshes. However, those who buy sneakers and running shoes do not need to bring a housing tax ticket. 2. You must wear them on the spot. 3. You must return the old shoes before you can exchange them for new shoes. 4. Galoshes are only sold on rainy days, and cloth-faced rubber shoes are only sold on sunny days. If the procedures are incomplete, or if the housing tax ticket already has your name on it, you will be refused to purchase." At the same time, it also sent a letter to the Municipal Rubber Industry Association to announce to the retail stores, roughly saying that due to the current lack of raw materials, the number of goods dispatched has been limited. In order to prevent trafficking, they are sold with citizen certificates and tried to add old shoes before new shoes can be exchanged. We hope that you will comply.</p>

<h3 id="e53">New Hope for Improving Order at the North Station Entrance <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Xiao</p>
<p>Since this forum published a special article and editorial on improving the order at the North Station entrance, and convened a symposium of prominent figures to exchange ideas, the North Station has indeed improved the entrance order since the 21st of last month. All passengers without luggage can now enter through the main entrance, no longer crowded in the line with those carrying luggage, which is extremely convenient for genuine passengers, a great difference from the previous situation.</p>
<p>Originally, the passenger queue had to extend to Baoshan Road, but now it only fills half of the wooden shed, a reduction of two-thirds compared to before, allowing most passengers to catch their trains in time, reach their destinations early, and not waste money on travel. This is truly a great benefit.</p>
<p>Human desires are inherently endless. Now that the entrance order at the North Station has been improved and is much more convenient, there are still many areas that need improvement. However, these requests are not excessive hopes, but rather realistic situations. Only a simple effort from the North Station authorities is needed to accomplish them. People should also understand the difficulties the North Station authorities have in managing traffic, but in reality, another request must be made.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai is a large metropolis with passengers traveling to visit relatives and friends, seek employment, negotiate transactions, and discuss important matters. Passengers always have some luggage when they travel, so they should wait in the wooden shed for inspection. However, according to the author's knowledge, the inspection time is still intermittent. For example, inspection stops at 10:00 AM and does not resume until 11:30 AM, then stops again at 12:00 noon, and then resumes at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. From this, it can be seen that those carrying luggage still do not receive any convenience, just like before. If someone is unlucky and happens to be next in line for inspection when the inspection time is over, they cannot be inspected and enter the station to catch their train in time, and instead have to stand in the wooden shed with their luggage for several hours. Therefore, a special request is made to the North Station authorities to continue the inspection until the last train, opening a door of convenience for passengers with luggage. Furthermore, most of the passengers standing in the wooden shed are poor. The wealthy hire redcaps to carry their luggage for inspection and send it into the station, while they themselves enter through the main entrance without luggage, which is much more convenient. If the North Station can change to continuous inspection, as stated in the symposium, "Passengers should not be divided by wealth, and even beggars riding the train are passengers." It goes without saying that the inspectors are very hardworking and strenuous, but only more shifts need to be added.</p>
<p>(2) The entrances for passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines should be separated because the time for inspecting luggage is determined by the departure time of the trains. For example, if there is a Nanjing train departing at 12:00 noon, the inspection should start at 11:30 AM. However, passengers from both lines are mixed together. Those who pass the inspection and enter the station are not necessarily all passengers taking the Nanjing train, but also passengers taking the Hangzhou train. Nanjing passengers, because they are at the back of the line, cannot be inspected and enter the station in time to catch their train. On the other hand, Hangzhou passengers are inspected and enter the station, but the time before their train departs is very long, which is not ideal for either party. If the entrances for the two lines are separated, this situation can be avoided, allowing passengers on both lines to catch their trains in time, avoid missing their trains, and reduce crowding.</p>
<p>(3) It is inappropriate for redcaps to carry luggage into the station for inspection. Because in the current situation, luggage is handed over to the redcaps to carry into the station, while passengers can only enter empty-handed from the main entrance and wait for their luggage. During this process, undesirable phenomena are bound to occur. Although the redcaps are employed by the North Station and have been investigated and have some sort of guarantee to prevent future misconduct, there are bound to be some unscrupulous individuals among them. If they secretly take out a few items, passengers may not notice in their haste, and if they do notice, they may think it was taken during inspection. Moreover, passengers often think that losing items is a minor matter, and catching the train is a major matter. As long as they can catch the train, who would bother to argue over a few missing items? If they try to investigate, the redcaps will always find an excuse. If they ask the inspecting military police, how can they remember everything in the numerous luggage, and language barriers also become a problem. It is requested that the North Station authorities allow passengers to accompany their luggage into the station. To prevent corruption, the military police can personally conduct a thorough search of the passengers. After all, the same inspection is required at the main entrance. If the military police have any doubts about a certain item in the luggage, they can ask and answer immediately. If any contraband is confiscated, passengers can also see it with their own eyes, which is a win-win situation. Otherwise, if the North Station authorities believe this method is not feasible, please allow passengers to watch the inspection of their luggage. After the inspection is completed, the passenger can lock the suitcase or pack the bedding and then hand it over to the redcap to carry into the station. The passenger can then enter the station empty-handed through the main entrance.</p>
<p>(4) The fees for redcaps to carry luggage should be regulated, with separate prices for large and small items, excluding small items (such as shoe boxes), so that passengers have something to follow, or a ticket purchase method can be used to avoid extra charges.</p>
<p>(5) A price list for baggage handling should be posted in the baggage room, stating the weight limit for free handling and the price for exceeding the weight, so that passengers can understand it at a glance and avoid paying extra money, which would not harm the station.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Sanitation Authorities of the Two Concessions Plan Summer Epidemic Prevention; Widespread Injections May Be Implemented Starting Next Month <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In view of the prevalence of cholera last summer, the sanitation departments of the two concessions believe that the reason was the lack of thorough prevention in advance, which made it impossible to completely eradicate the epidemic at the time. Therefore, in order to protect residents and ensure safety this summer, they have decided to take the most thorough preventive measures. The most important measure is to ensure food hygiene.</p>
<p>The way to inspect food hygiene is to strictly check the source of food in the vegetable markets or on the roads. In order to prevent the entry of food carrying infectious bacteria, the authorities will implement the distribution of fresh food. These distributed foods will be inspected by health inspectors. Vendors who sell fresh food without inspection will be punished.</p>
<p>Injections</p>
<p>Although the fundamental method of epidemic prevention lies in inspection, injections are also an important method to prevent the spread of cholera. This reporter recently received news that the authorities will not implement mandatory injections this month, but may order all residents to have an epidemic prevention certificate when walking on the streets within a certain period of time starting on April 1.</p>
<p>Fly Elimination</p>
<p>As for other important epidemic prevention plans, they are still being drafted. However, various measures implemented last summer, such as banning the sale of cut fruits and open bottled drinks along the roads and setting up temporary epidemic hospitals, will still be implemented. It is also heard that the sanitation department may launch a large-scale fly elimination campaign to urge residents to work hard to eliminate this type of pest that spreads infectious bacteria. In February, the Shanghai Municipal Council filed 5,377 public prosecution cases in the Special District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, including 4,497 violation cases and 980 criminal cases. In the violation cases, 2,861 defendants did not appear in court, and their bail was confiscated. 1,523 violation cases were concluded, 13 were dismissed, 1,522 defendants were punished, and 1 was declared not guilty. 987 criminal cases were judged, 2 were dismissed, 920 defendants were convicted, and 58 were acquitted. In addition, there were 14 criminal private prosecution cases.</p>
<p>In February, the Shanghai Municipal Council did not file any appeals. 1 old case was concluded. As of the end of the month, there were only 2 pending appeals. 49 appeals were filed by the defendants. 41 of these appeals were concluded, resulting in 1 case being remanded for retrial, 22 appeals being rejected, 1 appeal being withdrawn, 13 sentences being reduced, 1 sentence being increased, and 3 defendants being acquitted. As of the end of the month, there were a total of 212 pending appeals filed by the defendants.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Full Picture of French Indochina (2) <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Vietnamese</p>
<p>(2) From Elephant Herds to French Indochina</p>
<p>As early as 214 BC, the 33rd year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Annam appeared in China's territory, called "Xiang County," one of our country's famous counties. In the early Han Dynasty, Zhao Tuo, a former official of the Qin Dynasty, was enfeoffed as the King of Nanyue. Zhao Tuo declared himself emperor in 183 BC, the fifth year of Empress Lü Zhi of the Han Dynasty. At that time, the number of Han people going to "Nanyue" increased day by day. Anyone who studies Annam's literature will easily confirm that the vast majority of today's native Annamese are still descendants of the Chinese who migrated from southern China to Nanyue during the Qin and Han Dynasties. As for the culture, language, writing, surnames, politics, education, and customs of the Annamese, they still retain the styles of the Qin and Han Dynasties, even more so than those preserved in our mainland! This is something that anyone who has stayed in Annam for a while cannot deny.</p>
<p>After the Han Dynasty, Nanyue was a vassal state of China for generations. During the Tang Dynasty, a part of the region rebelled. In 866 AD, the seventh year of Emperor Yizong's Xiantong era, Gao Pian greatly defeated the "Southern Barbarians" and took Jiaozhi. In 968 AD, the first year of Emperor Taizu's Kaibao era in the Song Dynasty, Ding Bu Ling of Annam declared himself emperor and named the country "Qu Yue." In 973 AD, the sixth year of the Kaibao era, Ding Lian was enfeoffed as the King of Jiaozhi, and Jiaozhou was permanently designated as a "foreign vassal." After that, through the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, although there were times of rebellion and times of submission, the days of rebellion were always short and the days of submission were long. The Chinese authorities, in addition to accepting tributes, did not interfere in internal affairs, so it was called a "foreign vassal," but it was actually no different from being independent. Although the rulers of Annam were mostly descendants of Han people, what they represented was not the interests of the Chinese emperor. When the Song Dynasty's power declined, the feudal kingdoms of India repeatedly invaded Annam. The southwest, south, and southeast regions, namely Zhenla, Champa, and Dongpusai, which were called in the Song, Yuan, and Ming historical records of China, were once occupied. In the early 17th century, in 1527 AD, the sixth year of Emperor Jiajing of the Ming Dynasty, Mo Dengyong usurped the country. The original ruler of Annam, Li Weixuan, retreated to the Tokyo area. In 1537, the 16th year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, the Ming Dynasty issued an edict to punish Mo Dengyong. In 1541, the 20th year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, the Mo clan surrendered and established the Annam Metropolitan Command. In 1543, the 22nd year of Emperor Jiajing's reign, Ruan Gan served Li Ning, a descendant of the old king, and rebuilt the Greater Viet State. Later, the meritorious officials Ruan and Zheng, who restored the country, became increasingly powerful. The Zheng clan occupied Shunhua, "holding the emperor to command the princes," while the Ruan clan occupied Guangnan, calling themselves the Kings of Guangnan, and implemented a policy of enriching the country and strengthening the military. They recovered the southern part of the country and Dongpusai from the hands of the Indian local kings. In 1787, the 52nd year of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, Ruan Wenhui drove away Ruan Fuying, the youngest son of the King of Guangnan, and established himself. At the same time, he advanced his troops to Shunhua, destroyed the Zheng clan, drove away Li Weiqi, the King of Greater Viet, and occupied Tokyo, unifying Annam. In the following year (1788), Sun Shiyi, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, attacked Annam and restored the Li clan. However, Ruan Wenhui's power was very strong. In 1789, the 54th year of Emperor Qianlong's reign, the Qing court enfeoffed Ruan as the King of Annam. In 1803, the seventh year of Emperor Jiaqing's reign, Ruan Fuying rose again and unified Annam. In the following year (1803), he was enfeoffed as the "King of Vietnam."</p>
<p>While internal strife was subsiding, external troubles kept coming. The Westerners' struggle for colonies was being staged in various parts of East Asia. After France failed in India, it was followed by decades of domestic revolution and Napoleon's expeditions, and it had no time to look eastward. However, in the 1840s of the 19th century, it began its foreign operations again. Ten years later, it acquired vast colonies in the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, and after establishing a transportation base between Europe and Asia, it actively moved eastward, and India became a new battlefield. As for Annam, because the local feudal lords' years of internal warfare had consumed its national economy and defense capabilities, and at the same time, the suzerain Qing government was overwhelmed by the oppression of British imperialism and internal rebellions, it had no time to take care of itself. This provided France with an excellent opportunity to operate in Annam.</p>
<p>In the 1860s of the 19th century, France began to extend its colonial power to Annam. In 1863, backed by force, it concluded an agreement with the Annam dynasty, ceding the six southern provinces as the "French Cochinchina colony." Then, it extended its power to Cambodia, Tokyo, Annam, and Laos. In 1864, it signed a treaty with the King of Cambodia, making Cambodia a French protectorate. In 1873, it sent troops to Hanoi. In the following year, it continued to conclude the Saigon Treaty with the Annam dynasty, almost turning Annam and Tokyo into protectorates. Although the treaty was not implemented due to the victory of the Chinese revolutionary army in Annam, in 1882, France sent a large-scale expeditionary force and launched a large-scale offensive. In August of the same year, it captured Shunhua and forced the signing of a treaty, turning Annam proper and Tokyo (i.e., Tonkin) into French protectorates. In the last few years of the 19th century, it officially accepted Laos, the largest region, under the protection of the French colonial authorities.</p>
<p>China was originally the suzerain state of Vietnam, so how could it sit idly by and watch it being devoured? However, at that time, the Qing Dynasty's power was declining day by day. It was invaded by foreign powers from the outside, and after the Taiping Rebellion from the inside, it was followed by the Nian Rebellion. Zuo Zongtang was busy with affairs in Xinjiang and had no time to care about the border and foreign regions. When the Saigon Treaty was concluded, it only maintained a bit of face for the "Great Qing Empire" with a protest on paper. However, although the central government was昏庸孱弱, some virtuous and enthusiastic patriots were among the local authorities, especially the border generals, who volunteered to take on the task. Therefore, after the alliance was concluded under the city of Shunhua, the troops of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou were summoned to punish the invasion of Vietnam. At the end of the ninth year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1883), the French army, led by Briere and Negrien, advanced on Tokyo. In the spring of the following year, they occupied the lower reaches of the Red River and fiercely attacked Beining. In June, the French army attacked Liangshan but was defeated by the allied forces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. The morale of the Chinese army was greatly boosted. On August 26, the Qing court suddenly became optimistic about the war and declared war on France. The French army attacked by land and sea. The land army captured Liangshan on February 12, 1885, but the generals Feng Zicai and Huang Xiaoqi fought bravely, and the French army was defeated and routed, with a tendency to retreat completely from Vietnam. However, the navy attacked Taiwan and gained some advantages. But in terms of strategy, the French navy was only threatening the Qing court at that time, hoping to shake its determination to fight to the end. It had no real power to occupy Taiwan and force its way into the capital. The center of gravity was still on the war in Vietnam. At that time, Feng Zicai won a great victory in Liangshan, recovering one province, one prefecture, and one state of Vietnam. The French Admiral Negrien was seriously injured, and his elite troops were completely lost. The Jules Ferry cabinet of France therefore collapsed. However, the昏憤 Qing court signed the Sino-French Peace Treaty on April 27, 1885 (June 9, 1885), officially recognizing Annam as a French protectorate.</p>
<p>After France obtained this expanded colony, it further蚕食 Laos. On October 3, 1893, it signed the Franco-Siamese Treaty and acquired Laos. Thus, Cochinchina, Tonkin, Cambodia, Annam, and Laos were combined and called "French Indochina," becoming a French colony.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Economic Translations and Discussions: The Significance of Easing Restrictions on the Movement of Goods <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The decision to ease restrictions on the movement of goods in Central China, effective from the 16th of this month, is a sign of Japan's progress in its policies towards China, and is evidence that it is complying with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, and other political statements. Japan's so-called "practical morality policy" is to recognize China's independence and autonomy, to promote the development of the National Government, to enable China to actively contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and to assume the obligation to participate in the war. Therefore, Japan has further abandoned its vested political interests in China, and at the same time, in economic terms, has always adhered to the policy of respecting China's autonomy and creativity, promoting the exchange of goods, and further seeking economic ties between Shanghai and the interior. It is because of the above-mentioned views that this decision has been made. The easing of restrictions on the movement of goods is a clear sign of Japan's policy progress, and its significance is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The restrictions on the movement of goods implemented in the Japanese-occupied areas of the lower Yangtze River since October of the 16th year of Showa [1941] were measures taken to adapt to the special circumstances arising from the current incident [Second Sino-Japanese War], and of course, such abnormal conditions should not be maintained indefinitely. Moreover, the greatest contribution that China should make after participating in the war is to protect Japan's rear area and provide the materials necessary for the prosecution of the war. Japan hopes that China can complete this task itself. Therefore, a national commercial control association will soon be established, gathering economic giants from Shanghai and other places to organize and be responsible for controlling the collection and distribution of important materials, so as to contribute to stabilizing people's livelihoods and reviving the economy on the Chinese side, and to ensure the materials necessary for the prosecution of the war on the Japanese side. Without this measure, it would be insufficient to eliminate the special methods implemented due to the special circumstances of the past. Originally, most economic institutions used Japanese funds to purchase goods in the interior. After the implementation of this measure, this situation can be broken, so in the future, there will also be considerable benefits for Japan's normal economic activities.</p>
<p>In the current situation, this decision is a move that Japan is taking without sparing any resources, a move that will have a major impact. The monopolistic and exclusive privileges enjoyed by some Japanese merchants in the past will inevitably be lost, but they will be given the opportunity to operate on the same conditions as the Chinese side. However, this sacrifice is unavoidable and there is no reason to avoid it, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and the comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. It is said that the authorities are determined to promote the new policy, and have decided to severely punish those who violate this measure. I hope that all Japanese merchants will be cautious and self-disciplined, and embrace the ideal of adapting to the new situation, so as not to let the authorities' painstaking efforts be in vain.

<h3 id="e62">The Financial Industry Should Transform Competition into Cooperation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>According to a recent notice from the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, in order to prevent insurance companies from indiscriminately soliciting business, the establishment of insurance agencies is specifically restricted. The establishment of agencies is not allowed in the location of the head office, branch offices, or sub-branch offices of insurance companies, and only one agency is allowed in each location other than the location of the head office, branch offices, or sub-branch offices, in order to avoid business competition and indiscriminately accepting insurance amounts. The intention can be said to be profound.</p>
<p>The biggest problem currently facing insurance companies is how to concentrate the resources of Chinese insurance companies to establish a reinsurance center. If each insurance company underwrites property without distributing the risk, the risk is too concentrated, and the consequences are unimaginable! Therefore, it is entirely dependent on reinsurance to average the burden. Although there are now organizations such as the Taiping Reinsurance Group, the Great Shanghai Reinsurance Group, and the Jiulian Reinsurance Group to meet the needs of reinsurance, this is only the beginning of cooperation. It is hoped that the entire resources will be gathered and closer cooperation will be sought, so that the heavy responsibility of the insurance industry in the future can be shouldered. It cannot be achieved by those who only engage in competing for business and acting independently.</p>
<p>From this, we are reminded of the business of banks. If banks only set up a few more branches and sub-branches to collect a large amount of deposits and seek temporary profits, and do not seek common cooperation in legitimate business, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it will never be possible to achieve the great cause of banking. For example, the current promotion of acceptance and discounting of bills of exchange must be promoted by the banking industry in unison in order to be effective, which is one example. Today's economic society is in a state of uncertainty. How can a lone sail drift in the ocean? It must have the strength of the community to be successful. The key issue for the financial industry is cooperation, and the most valuable thing for cooperation is openness and honesty. Openness and honesty are most valuable to eliminate unnecessary competition. Therefore, it is necessary to transform competition into cooperation in order to establish the permanent foundation of our financial industry.</p>

<p>The Yokohama Specie Bank is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting at its Tokyo branch on the 13th. Before attending this shareholders' meeting, Mr. Kawamura Nijuro, the manager of the bank's Shanghai branch, gave a speech, hinting at the future direction of the Specie Bank, roughly saying: "Based on the reorganization ideal of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the reorganization of the Specie Bank is a safe measure. Its goal is to facilitate the smooth exchange of goods in East Asia. The content should seek a more substantial organization than the present." Regarding this matter, according to the observation of a powerful person in this city, "The Specie Bank mainly deals in foreign exchange business. Since its establishment in February of the 13th year of Meiji [1880] until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has always taken consistent steps with the cultivation of Japanese economic power, and has been able to improve Japan's economic position and reach the level of a world-class bank. However, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the cessation of world trade, the bank, which mainly dealt in trade foreign exchange, had to limit its scope to Japan's business with China and the South. However, for the sake of reorganizing the entire economic structure of Greater East Asia, it is expected that the bank's character will be reformed based on the reorganization ideal of the East Asian economy. This direction will be clarified at the shareholders' meeting. At the same time, the persons in charge of Manchuria, North China, Shanghai, and Shonan [Singapore] will report on the situation in various places. Regarding the decision on future policies, there will be various opinions expressed, and the results are quite noteworthy."</p>
<p>Looking at the financial dynamics in Japan's mainland, in the Kanto area, Mitsui and Dai-ichi, Mitsubishi and Dai-Hyaku Bank have respectively signed contracts. In addition, Yasuda Bank has absorbed and merged Japan Nichiya Bank and intends to merge with the Third Bank. In Kansai, Sumitomo, Sanwa, Nomura, Osaka Savings, and Japan Trust all intend to sign contracts, and they also intend to have banks absorb the life insurance industry (i.e., life insurance industry) so that the financial structure can be unified and economic control can be rationally promoted. The Southern Development Gold Treasury has already been established to pool all funds to increase production, and the Financial Gold Treasury has been established in the Ministry of Finance. Specie Bank, Taiwan Bank, Industrial Bank, Kin-Roh Bank, Chosen Bank, etc., will inevitably be reorganized in this direction.</p>
<p>Looking at the financial dynamics of the Specie Bank in China, before the freezing of funds, it relied on foreign exchange trading and other businesses to maintain the yen exchange market, and at the same time, it supplied the foreign exchange needs of traders. Its achievements were remarkable, and it made great contributions to the promotion of Japanese trade to the world market. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, trade was cut off, so it shifted its business policy from trade finance to the reorganization of the East Asian economic sphere, promoting the smooth flow of goods in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is generally believed that it will re-emerge as an exchange bank under a brand-new ideal. Therefore, the bank's future management policy will follow this line and adopt various policies.

<p>In order to adapt to the new situation after Japan's domestic financial control and the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China, the local Japanese banks will change their past business status. 1. In the past, the businesses of the various banks were generally the same. In the future, each bank will have its own business focus. However, how to divide the focus must await the instructions of the controlling authorities. 2. In the past, the businesses of the various banks were biased towards business aspects. In the future, they will further adopt an attitude of cooperating with China.</p>

<p>Although overseas transportation in this city is hindered and various types of trade have come to a standstill, trade between China, Japan, and Manchukuo seems to have made considerable progress. At the same time, after the financial authorities have made adjustments to the customs offices in various places, tax revenue has gradually increased. Yesterday, the reporter inquired from the Jianghai Customs and learned that the customs' import, export, and transit tax revenue in recent months has significantly increased several times compared to the past, and the gradual restoration of the customs organs in Nanjing and various parts of South China, the promotion of tax revenue, and the results have become even better. If South Seas trade is restored, the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the South Seas territories will inevitably become smoother, and the customs tax revenue will increase even more, which will benefit the national finances quite a bit.</p>

In the middle of February, the deposit interest rate was 1.2% per month, and the loan interest rate was 3.6%. There was only one newly established money shop in the middle of February, the Dalai Silver Company, with a capital of 500,000 yuan. There are two money shops in preparation, Jingda and Yongkang, with a capital of about 500,000 yuan each. In the middle of February, the total amount of remittances from money shops was 38 million yuan to other places and 26 million yuan to Nanjing, for a total of 64 million yuan. The total amount of current deposits was 12 million yuan, and the loans were more than 33 million yuan. As for prices, they rose slightly in February compared to January, but it is hoped that they will be stabilized after the establishment of the Economic Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e69">The Current State of Shanghai's Industry <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yunhen</p>
<p>In the past year, Shanghai's economic life has undergone significant changes. The era of laissez-faire economics has come to an end, replaced by a planned and controlled economy. This major change is reflected in all sectors of the economy. The industrial sector, which is responsible for production, is undoubtedly the most severely affected.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing for the current industrial sector in Shanghai is the serious problem of the source of raw materials. Before the war, although most of the raw materials needed by Shanghai's general industry were supplied domestically, a portion still had to rely on foreign imports. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, due to the obstruction of domestic transportation and the difficulty of transportation, the raw materials needed by Shanghai's industrial sector almost entirely relied on foreign supplies. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the import of foreign goods was cut off. In addition, the materials requested from Japan were quite limited due to shipping. The raw material problem became increasingly serious. Due to the lack of raw materials and the limitation of power, factories had to suspend or reduce production in order to limit production. It is estimated that factories in non-military industries can only maintain about 30% of their normal operating rate. At the same time, the number of factories and the number of workers have also decreased dramatically. According to a survey at the end of last year, there were 1,145 factories in the city, a decrease of two-thirds compared to the 3,485 factories before the incident. The number of workers was 120,000, a decrease of one-half compared to the 250,000 before the incident.</p>
<p>Another reason for the shrinking of industrial production is that products usually have price limits, while raw materials are left to their own devices, thus forming an abnormal phenomenon of expensive raw materials and cheap finished products. This prompted factories to be happy to hoard raw materials rather than process and manufacture them. Because the sale of raw materials is easy and the profit is high, it is sometimes impossible to obtain such a high profit after the products are manufactured. Therefore, it is inevitable to restrict production. In addition, the increasingly thinning economic connection between Shanghai and the interior, and the gradual self-sufficiency of the rural areas in the interior, are also a major reason for the depression of industry.</p>
<p>However, although industrial production has decreased, in the high tide of the wartime economy, the continued rise in prices and the relatively slow adjustment of industry have enabled the industrial sector to obtain unprecedented profits in the process of wealth redistribution. It is common for those with tens of thousands of yuan of capital to obtain hundreds of thousands of yuan of profit. On the surface, it seems that capital is flowing into production enterprises to support the development of industry; in reality, it seems that it is still a question of whether the industrial sector actively engages in production after obtaining funds.</p>
<p>Secondly, when the source of raw materials is not resolved, manufacturers often find it difficult to take into account technical excellence in order to save materials, resulting in inferior quality. Consumers also only seek to have goods and do not care about the quality due to the difficulty of purchasing. Therefore, the quality of industrial products is deteriorating.</p>
<p>The current Shanghai industry is difficult to satisfy people in terms of both quantity and quality. In terms of quantity, the sharp decrease in the number of factories, the very low proportion of workers in the city's population, and the insufficient supply of industrial products are all obvious facts. In terms of quality, the general low production efficiency, the deterioration of product quality, and the development of the industrialists' fluke mentality are all sufficient to hinder the forward development of national industry.</p>
<p>Since the current ills of Shanghai's industry are as described above, for the sake of increasing wartime economic strength and rebuilding post-war industry, it seems that wise industrialists should abandon the mentality of seeking only short-term profits, broaden their horizons, and take improving production efficiency and completing production targets as their prerequisites.</p>
<p>At the time when the regulations on the control of the movement of goods are announced and the National Association for Commercial Control is established, I specifically briefly explained the current state of Shanghai's industry, in order to arouse the attention of the private economic sector.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of Manchuria implemented a full reorganization on October 26th of last year. On the 18th of last month, it held the first business report meeting after the reorganization, and the bank's authorities reported on the results of the second half of last year as follows: 1. The average amount of currency issued during the period (referring to the second half of last year) was 1,243,123,000 yuan, an increase of 296,806,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. 2. Government deposits during the period increased by 67,299,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to increased tax revenue and increased postage. 3. General deposits during the period increased by 41,354,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to the authorities' encouragement of savings. 4. General loans during the period decreased by 133,712,000 yuan compared to the same period last year due to the adoption of a restrictive policy. 5. Discounted bills during the period increased by 29,646,000 yuan compared to the previous year due to increased loans for the purchase of goods. 6. The average holding amount of national debt and other securities during the period was 1,217,360,000 yuan, an increase of 296,900,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>Hong Kong started to handle the repatriation of Chinese people from March 5th. All those who have applied for registration to return home will gather in free dormitories from the 5th and depart by ship on the 6th. The authorities will also give each person a travel allowance of 20 yuan and the food they need along the way.</p>
<p>This time, the Hong Kong authorities abolished the restrictions on the business of Chinese banks, and Kin Cheng Banking Corporation decided to take the opportunity to close its Hong Kong branch. The cancellation of the system of restricting the business of Chinese banks is an important measure for the revival of Hong Kong's financial sector and can promote the financial economy to move towards normality. After the incident, funds from Shanghai flowed into Hong Kong, and there was also speculative business in managing legal tender exchange, so many Shanghai banks set up branches in Hong Kong. However, the current environment has changed, and there is no need for Shanghai banks to remain in Hong Kong. Kin Cheng Banking Corporation's measure is the most appropriate. The Financial Department of the Hong Kong Governor's Office hosted representatives of the Hong Kong banking community on the 5th. During the meeting, the Governor's Office explained the current financial policy and exchanged various opinions. Chinese and Japanese banks decided to jointly form a financial committee in a short period of time to enhance the liaison between the Hong Kong banking community so that they could accomplish their original mission.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Fertilizer Allocation Association held its establishment meeting on the 4th, aiming to benefit agriculture and solve all difficulties.

<h3 id="e74">The Possibility of Increasing Food Production <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Chinese agriculture is intensive agriculture (Translator's note: Intensive agriculture refers to investing more capital and labor in narrower land to operate agriculture, with the aim of increasing production). With the current farming methods, it seems that the harvest has reached its maximum limit. There is almost no room to expand the cultivated area. Most of the area that can be cultivated has already been cultivated. Even if there is uncultivated land, and it is cultivated, the harvest is very small, so it has become abandoned land. Although there is the word "increase production," it is actually a very difficult problem. Generally, those who study Chinese agriculture always hold this view. In general, these opinions are of course correct, but because of this point, to immediately issue pessimistic remarks seems to be too much of an estimate!</p>
<p>In the places we have seen, there is still a lot of room for improving agriculture, so the possibility of increasing production still exists and has not been exploited. For example, let's take rice cultivation as an example! Improving rice seedlings, reducing seeds, extending the seedling period, inserting strong and high-quality seedlings, or improving fertilizers, guiding the method of fertilization, sulfur, and soybean cake must be accurately guided, so that they are not biased and unbalanced. The whole creation is a very important task. Is it not also a good method to eliminate pests and find ways to eradicate them?</p>
<p>Speaking of increasing production, the issue of operating area and chemical fertilizers, etc., is raised. Although this is common sense for the Japanese, saying so makes the problem easier to understand. The harvest per acre is only about 2.5 shi even in the fertile area of Jiangnan. The average harvest is below 1.5 shi, and there is still much room for increasing production.</p>
<p>As for the problem of pests, I once heard a certain technician say that there is absolutely no way to eliminate pests. But I think it is too much to say. As long as you are determined to do it, be careful that your own fields are not harmed by pests, and at the same time pay attention to the adjacent land and nearby fields, and jointly find ways to eradicate pests. It is also an easy problem to solve. Speaking of this, some people may think that it is because of the pests in the rural areas of Central China that the commonality of the rural areas has been lost. However, this should be regarded as a phenomenon that occurs because they are not concerned about pests.</p>
<p>If we can actively improve seeds, supply fertilizers, and build water conservancy projects, then the agricultural production in Central China will definitely be renewed. However, the oppression of Malthusianism still exists in the meantime, so there is still a pessimistic view that as food production increases, the population will inevitably increase. However, this is a future problem. What we want to emphasize at present is to hope for increased production.

<h3 id="e75">Cotton Production in Central China <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the need to strive for cotton production has become extremely urgent. As a result of efforts to increase production, the raw material production of the textile industry in the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is gradually achieving self-sufficiency. The approximate figures for cotton production in various regions are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Production in East Asia</p>
<p>Region 　Production (in "dan," a unit of weight)</p>
<p>North China 　408,900 dan</p>
<p>Central China 　2,248,000 dan</p>
<p>Korea 　776,050 dan</p>
<p>Continent 　200,000 dan</p>
<p>Philippines 　8,000 dan</p>
<p>Indochina 　20,000 dan</p>
<p>Thailand 　50,000 dan</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 　10,000 dan</p>
<p>Burma 　32,000 dan</p>
<p>Total 　8,721,050 dan</p>
<p>It is estimated that the cotton raw materials needed within the Co-prosperity Sphere are at least 15,000,000 dan under normal conditions, but the minimum requirement is only 8,000,000 dan.</p>
<p>Therefore, the normal production of various regions in East Asia, as shown in the table above, has been expanded. This expansion is also in line with needs. Precisely because of this, the authorities are further considering increasing the production of raw cotton in Japan by 4,000,000 dan, Manchuria by 200,000 dan, China by 45,000,000 dan, and the southern regions by 1,000,000 to 4,000,000 dan.</p>
<p>Speaking of China's raw cotton production, the highest record of 13,935,311 dan was achieved in 1934. Since then, China's production has gradually declined. This can be clearly seen in the following comparative table.</p>
<p>China's Raw Cotton Production</p>
<p>The sharp drop in production is due to various reasons, including local conditions and the influence of natural forces.</p>
<p>However, the fundamental issue for increasing domestic cotton production lies in expanding the cultivated area, improving planting methods, and eliminating excessive purchasing as a stimulus for cotton planting.</p>
<p>In Central China, the cotton seeds used are mainly divided into two categories: Asian varieties and Upland varieties. According to a survey conducted in 1940, 60% of China's cotton fields were planted with Asian varieties. Only 4% were planted with Upland varieties. Furthermore, it is important to understand that Upland varieties have a longer maturity period, therefore, most Chinese farmers do not like them.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Central China Cotton Control Association has been doing its utmost to improve the quality of cotton in China and expand cotton-growing areas. A five-year production plan has also been formulated. Under this plan, it is hoped that Central China's cotton production can reach 5,000,000 dan per year—which is also the region's normal pre-war production volume.</p>
<p>Related to the plans for increasing and improving cotton production is the development of Jiangbei, north of the Yangtze River, into a cotton-growing area. This plan is very worthy of attention because the land and climate in this area are most suitable for cotton planting. Plans are underway to attract bankers, factory owners, and local landlords to invest in the cotton industry in Jiangbei. This area will definitely become the most important cotton-producing center in Central China. To encourage investors, the responsible authorities can automatically guarantee investments and reasonable interest.</p>
<p>Currently, the Ministry of Industry is studying and formulating various plans to promote and increase China's cotton production. In this work, the assistance provided by the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association is of great value. They are paying special attention to improving the technical issues of cotton planting. (Translated by Yingying, February 6th, China Herald)</p>

<p>Manchukuo's Four Major Coal Mining Companies to be Operated Independently and Capital Reduced</p>
<p>Dalian, 10th (Havas)—According to the Manchuria Daily News, the Fuxin, Beipiao, and Xi'an coal mines, belonging to the Manchuria Coal Mining Company, will be reorganized in the future and operated independently. In the past, in order to promote production efficiency, the government entrusted the operation of these coal mines to the Manchuria Coal Mining Company. Now, because the work of the above-mentioned mines has entered a stable phase, in order to enable the Manchuria Coal Mining Company to actively develop other coal mines, it has been decided to change these coal mines to independent operation. At the same time, the capital of the Manchuria Coal Mining Company will also be reduced from 300 million yuan to 100 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Living in Hardship <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Du Tie</p>
<p>Living in hardship is extremely difficult. Things don't go as planned eight or nine times out of ten, so the psychological pain is inevitable. Because of economic difficulties, the physical body also suffers from malnutrition. Both the psychological and physical aspects feel oppressed. Some people comfort themselves with waiting and expecting, or vent their feelings through sighs and resentment. This is human nature, not an abnormality of a few people.</p>
<p>Waiting and expecting are a kind of comfort for hardship, but this kind of comfort is like applying pain-relieving oil to a headache. It seems easier when you apply it, but after a while, the headache remains.</p>
<p>Sighing and resenting are a kind of venting for pain, but this kind of venting is like sneezing when you have a cold. It seems refreshing when you sneeze, but after a while, the cold remains.</p>
<p>Whether you wait and expect or sigh and resent, hardship remains hardship and does not decrease by even a tiny bit. In fact, because of waiting, expecting, sighing, and resenting, a lot of time is wasted and a lot of energy is consumed. As a result, the psychological pain is felt even more, and the physical body becomes even weaker. Often, nothing is accomplished, poverty and illness come together, and one ends up "dying with depression and without fulfilling one's ambitions" and "hating everything together."</p>
<p>Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it must first afflict their mind, exhaust their muscles and bones, starve their body, empty their possessions, and disrupt what they do, so as to stir their heart, strengthen their nature, and increase what they cannot do." This is not entirely to encourage people to become great figures like the legends of Shun; it applies to everyone. Clearly, unless we don't want to be human, we must have the patience and ability to cope with and overcome hardship.</p>
<p>From a biological point of view, every living thing, in order to live, must be busy and make the greatest effort. How much more so should we, who are extremely complex human beings? How much more so in this unprecedented era?</p>
<p>No matter how difficult the situation is, we must stand firm, make plans, look at the big picture, and start with what is close at hand. Do things little by little, realistically and pragmatically. Make the most of our free time, train our abilities, cultivate our knowledge, and serve society and the people.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Born in sorrow, dies in comfort." If we are in hardship and just wait and expect, or sigh and resent, even if we are lucky enough to get through the sorrow, we are nothing more than "waste!" "Warts!"</p>
<h3 id="e80">Nietzsche's Gift of a Book to Wagner (Part 2) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>— One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists</p>
<p>Text: When I send this book to you, I am placing my secret in your and your wife's hands, confident that you will treat it as your own. I wrote this book; in it, I declare my innermost views on people and things, and for the first time, I have summarized all my thoughts. This book has been a great comfort to me in a period full of disturbances and hardships, because nothing else can comfort me. I almost think that the reason I am still alive is because I can still write such a book.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why I must publish it anonymously: first, because I do not want to interfere with the effect of my early works; second, because this is my only means to prevent the public and private from insulting my personal dignity (because of my health, I can no longer tolerate this insult); and finally, and most importantly, because I hope to succeed in a scientific discussion, in which all friends of intelligence can participate, without any concerns, unlike when I published before. No one will use words or text to attack my name.</p>
<p>I know that anyone who harbors the ideas expressed in this book will not be surprised by the refutations it will cause.</p>
<p>My feelings are like those of an officer who has broken through a fortress, regardless of the heavy wounds they have suffered; he has reached the city and unfurled his national flag, even if he looks around and is still surrounded, he experiences more joy than sorrow.</p>
<p>Although I know, as I said, that no one will have the same views as me, I still want to be very self-satisfied in thinking that I am not alone in my thoughts, but that I am sharing them with others. I have the strangest sense of solitude and sociability; I also have the feeling of a pioneer, who only knows how to move forward desperately and does not know whether the crowds of warriors are following behind—in fact, he does not even know if they exist.</p>
<p>Aftermath: This letter was not actually sent to Wagner. As for the book, because, in the opinion of the publisher, only books with the author's name printed on the cover could be sold, Nietzsche was unwilling to publish it anonymously. Therefore, Nietzsche carefully reviewed the original manuscript again and removed all the words that would cause pain to Wagner. Instead of sending the originally written letter, he sent a copy of "Human, All Too Human," with the following words written on it: "Friend—now there is nothing binding us. Our views are even poles apart, completely incompatible, but we have enjoyed the competition of our alternating views." However, he could not be said to be objective about Wagner's views. He demanded worship, flattery, and unconditional loyalty. According to Nietzsche's sister, what Wagner saw in "Human, All Too Human" was nothing but "the heresy of his former disciple—even worse, the heresy of that beloved disciple and genius... Therefore, the impact of this matter was equivalent to a blow and an insult. The break was forever..." Nietzsche died in 1900. At the moment of his death, he went insane and saw the image of the person he had once worshiped, and he said softly, "I loved him very much."</p>
<h3 id="e81">Habit <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Han</p>
<p>Entering a room filled with orchids or a shop filled with salted fish, one does not notice the fragrance or stench after a long time. This is because of habit. Hearing vendors on the street shout "White fruit as big as goose eggs" without noticing the absurdity, this is habit. Seeing train ticket sellers taking bribes without thinking it is a crime, this is also habit...</p>
<p>In a broader sense: smoking opium and taking drugs is also a habit, being addicted to gambling and pleasure is also a habit, and even now, the general ladies and young misses are still burning incense and praying, worshiping Buddha and seeking gods, which is also a habit.</p>
<p>Bad habits are the inducement to chronic criminal behavior. They blind us and lead us into the wrong path without self-awareness.</p>
<p>Old habits are the product of conservatism. They delay the evolution of the world and burden the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Friends! Let's remove the lice of old habits from our bodies! Otherwise, they will harm our bodies and minds. We need to be "unaccustomed," because "unaccustomed" is the driving force for the development and innovation of everything.</p>

<p>Kidneys: Specializing in excretion, after receiving a pile of waste, they first sort it out. If they find anything that can still be used (such as glucose, protein, and water), they keep it and send it back into the blood to be burned again, so as not to waste resources. The truly useless things are sent to the ureter, bladder, and urethra to be excreted as much as possible. As for heat, if the boiler of a machine burns too hot, it is bound to explode. Since a large amount of heat is generated in the body, in order to regulate it, the excess heat is turned into water vapor and dissipated from the pores of the skin as sweat. At the same time, the air exhaled from the lungs also contains a lot of water vapor to help regulate it.</p>

At the same time, the air exhaled from the lungs also contains a lot of water vapor to help regulate it.</p>
<p>The work of a machine must be properly managed in order to exert excellent performance; the manager of the human body machine is the "nerve." The above-mentioned phenomena and all other physiological functions are managed by nerves. Nerves can be divided into central nerves and peripheral nerves in terms of their position and nature, and into sensory, motor, and mixed nerves in terms of function. Roughly speaking, the central nervous system includes the brain in the skull, the medulla oblongata in the neck, and the spinal cord in the spine. Peripheral nerves are the branches that come out of the central nervous system, distributed throughout the body and managing sensation or movement. The main function of the spinal cord is to connect the sensation and movement of the trunk and limbs with the brain. The function of the medulla oblongata is mainly to manage heartbeat and breathing, so it is particularly important for life. The function of the brain is very complex, and much is still not fully understood, but undoubtedly it is the overall master of everything. Not only are all the movements and sensations of the body subject to its control, but also our will, thoughts, emotions, wisdom, and other spiritual phenomena are ruled by it.</p>
<p>The difference between the body and a machine, apart from spiritual phenomena, is that it has "sensory organs" and "movement." The coal needed for a machine is taken care of by someone, but the human body does not have this kind of luck. We must find and obtain it ourselves. For this purpose, we have sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, and tongue to recognize all external situations, report them to the nerves, and then issue orders to make the necessary movements to seek survival. The method of seeking survival is either actively seeking food or passively defending against harm. The movement of our body is the method of solving this problem. The organs of movement are bones and muscles. Bones form the frame of the body, and muscles surround it to form a flying body. When the nerves issue an order, the muscles contract, causing the bones to move, so we can use movement to obtain survival.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to just survive ourselves. We will all die one day. Old machines are decreasing day by day, and new machines must come in batches to replenish them. Therefore, we also have the function of "reproduction." Due to the union of the two sexes, the male and female reproductive cells combine in the female body to form a new individual, which then develops into a fetus in the female body. However, this is only a small machine with a rough outline. It must undergo "development" after being born at full term before it can gradually become a complete machine.</p>
<p>Finally, to strengthen the effectiveness of machine work, it must be oiled and checked frequently. The human body can obtain "vitamins" from external food. At the same time, there are various "endocrine hormones" (i.e., hormones) in the body. The discovery of these two types of things is still relatively recent. They are still changing day by day. Generally speaking, there are many types of these two types of things. Some can promote physical development, some can regulate various physiological functions, and some can enhance the effectiveness of work in the body. In a word, they all undertake the responsibility of oiling and calibrating the human body machine, so that the body does not often malfunction.</p>
<p>Heaven has given us such a structurally complex and functionally mysterious machine. We should all give full play to its work. Moreover, we have something that ordinary machines do not have—a soul. We should cherish and protect it even more, use the soul to drive the machine, and do work that ordinary machines cannot do. We must never develop ourselves into a soulless machine! So if you ask, "How do we live?" the best answer is: "We live as a machine with a soul." (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Determination <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yang</p>
<p>Personal determination plants the seeds of success. It constantly stimulates a person's spirit in the course of developing a career, gives him courage, and makes the career advance forever, reaching his final goal.</p>
<p>Someone hopes to accomplish something. Although he works hard and diligently, he still inevitably fails, which is that he still lacks determination. Perhaps he encountered setbacks halfway through the event. The environment suppressed his will. His courage was blown away, and his spirit was devastated. So he thought that the future must be more difficult and success was hopeless. So he gave up half of his achievements and dropped his work in frustration; he failed.</p>
<p>An event will never go smoothly. There will often be many adversities hindering you. Determination overcomes these obstacles. It will redouble its efforts, encourage people to move forward, no different from a strong heart agent being injected into a patient when his mind is dizzy. Failure is painful. But, in his painful emotions, he will gain inspiration, so he will work harder and more diligently, and finally he will complete his career. So I say, isn't the success gained after several failures due to a strong determination that is agitating him, so that his career will not be abandoned?</p>
<p>So it is said that only determination will lead to success.</p>

<p>She was about to continue, when Xue Fengchun walked in, came behind her, and said to her: "Sister, today we are all relying on you, otherwise, I don't know when the quarrel will end." As she turned around, he shook his head at her, stuck out his tongue, and made a face.</p>
<p>She stopped talking and hurried out.</p>
<p>Xue Fengchun still sat at the counter, took out a cigarette and smoked, with a smile on his face, showing that he had some kind of triumph. "Chongweng, how old is the Third Miss this year? Is she engaged?" Yang Zijie asked.</p>
<p>"She seems to be twenty years old this year and is not yet engaged..."</p>
<p>"Then let me act as a matchmaker, shall I?" He stroked his beard again. "It's the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge..."</p>
<p>Genming listened intently to the conversation on the kang bed, temporarily forgetting the anxiety in his heart. He also knew about the Zhou family of Qiantang Bridge, who were wealthy households with thousands of acres of land. He felt that if Mei married into the Zhou family, it would be a perfect match.</p>
<p>"Zi Weng, then please, please." Huang Chong'an could not help but cup his hands in thanks for his daughter's marriage.</p>
<p>Yu Duzhou and Xue Fengchun also joined the discussion about the Zhou family and You Mei's engagement. Genming couldn't interject and only listened from the side.</p>
<p>"But I'm afraid the Third Sister won't agree," Xue Fengchun said.</p>
<p>"The order of parents, the words of a matchmaker, the Third Miss is knowledgeable and courteous and will definitely agree," Yu Duzhou opined.</p>
<p>Xue Fengchun smiled, raised his face high, looked at the ceiling, and puffed smoke, temporarily ceasing to speak.</p>
<p>"Mr. Duzhou is right," Yang Zijie continued, "Miss will definitely agree. I just can't stand the current young students, both male and female, who talk about love at every turn..." He scolded the love of young men and women students severely, and Huang Chong'an and Yu Duzhou nodded in praise, echoing him repeatedly.</p>
<p>But Xue Fengchun still maintained that leisurely attitude, not saying a word. Genming listened with squinted eyes, and gradually, there were some words that he didn't understand. But he knew that this was because he hadn't gone to school, and he didn't think that there was anything wrong with what they were saying. (10)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Sleep Time <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Bin</p>
<p>Sleep is a physiological function for human beings to restore brain fatigue. The amount of sleep time varies greatly depending on age: on average, a four-year-old child needs twelve hours of sleep, a seven-year-old eleven hours, an eight- to nine-year-old ten and a half hours, a ten- to eleven-year-old ten hours, and a twelve-year-old only needs nine hours. In short, children need more sleep time than adults, and the weak need more than the strong.</p>
<p>Infants from one month to about one year old after birth also need to sleep fifteen to twenty hours a day. This is the general average standard. Of course, people with high ability can sleep very well. From a survey of school children, it can also be seen that children with good grades and healthy children get enough sleep. However, whether sleep is good or not cannot be determined by the amount, because those who do not sleep soundly or who have dream sleep can make the mind tired. Social Services</p>
<h3 id="e87">Proceeds from the Charity Sale of Paper Flowers Donated to the Midwifery Fund for Elementary School Female Teachers <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Fuyou Orphanage and Soup Kitchen Share the Benefits</p>
<p>Ms. Qu Zhonglun, Chairwoman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association, sent a letter yesterday: "Our Association held a charity flower sale on Women's Day, raising a total of 12,256.97 yuan. After deducting 5,248.25 yuan in expenses, there is a remaining balance of 7,008.72 yuan. Yesterday, seeing your newspaper's appeal for the Fuyou Orphanage, we are specifically donating 1,008.72 yuan. We are also donating 1,000 yuan to the Shanghai South Charity Association Soup Kitchen. The remaining 5,000 yuan has been decided by our Association to be allocated as a midwifery fund for elementary school female teachers. All application, registration, and investigation procedures are proposed to be handled by your newspaper. Applicants should bring the document approved by your newspaper to our Association to receive the midwifery fund. (Editor's note: The two donations have been received and will be distributed on your behalf. Thank you in advance.)</p>
