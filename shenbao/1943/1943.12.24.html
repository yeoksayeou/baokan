<p>社評</p>
<h3>希望於米統會當局</h3>
<p>年關將屆，商業方面循例結帳，銀根周轉趨緊，論理脫貨求現，物價應向下游，可是，最近期內，物價反形上漲，且漲風犀利，與過去歷次波動的情形相仿。推究原因，我們認為這次物價的上漲，是受了米與煤上漲的刺激，因為米與煤兩項，是民生必需品中最主要者，我們生活一天，就一天少不了米與煤。米與煤漲價，於是一切物價工價都跟者上漲，自非無因了。</p>
<p>我們卽以上述物價上漲的原因，作為立論之根據，對於抑平物價的重點，應側注於米與煤兩項。本市物價評議會已於昨日召開會議，以籌緊急對策，我們將提供意見，貢獻執行時的參攷。今天先就米的問題，再申所見，以期喚起當局責任之心。</p>
<p>上海是都市，本身不產米糧，五百萬人口，完全仰給四郊農村及產米地域。無論米糧配給如何不足，無論運輸如何困難，而五百萬人口中因之為餓殍者究不多見，論者每謂受惠於走私的黑市米之源源供給。我們主張取締走私，消滅黑市，則來源不繼，豈非上海市民將成為餓殍？其實不然，我們主張取締走私，是以公運代之；我們主張消滅黑市，是以官價代之。減少走私與黑市之剝前，使生產者與消費者交受其惠。這個任務，是應由米糧統制委員會完全擔負的。</p>
<p>米統會規定的職務，是採辦，備運，配給，在客觀上業非有此三項職務，不足以言整個「統制」的意義，不足以完成「統制」的使命。老實說，米糧統制是動輒關係民衆共同利益的大事，決不是普通的政務機關，做官畫行了事的。是政府責成人民辦理的自治機構，辦理失敗，不但無以對政府，無以對大衆，更無以對人民自治前途的地位。所以，一經接受辦理，卽須負絕對責任。</p>
<p>現在，上海五百萬巿民，事實上都能取得米糧，這巳充分證明間題不在米糧供給與遝輸上的困難，進一步說，上海的戶口米是可以取得充分配給，目前所以配給不足，黑市猖獗，是米統會未能盡其責任。來自走私與黑市的米，經過米統會而變成公運與官價的米之後，豈不是就足够配給呢？</p>
<p>我們近來接到各方面的報吿，對於米統會簽發採辦證有作弊情事，對於正當採辦商人的墊款有故意延付情事，噴有煩言。而衡之過去糧政弊　，以及目前利用官價與黑市之懸殊差額，企圖非法利得。我們對此不能不以保留態度，促起米統會當局主義澈查，秉公處理。</p>
<p>全國商業統治會棉業管理處，最近會查察屬員舞弊情事，予以懲處，我們要求將懲處事實吿之社會，俾使目無法紀者知所炯戒。同時，我們希望米統會懍於責任艱鉅，嚴誡屬員，奉公守法，對於凟職分子，不稍寬假，懲一儆百，為人民自治機構保留顏面。我們早在米統會成立之初，對於袁主任委員過去歷史，表示信任，而於幹部人事問題，即再四提供嚴肅守法，以促注意，今不幸而外界噴有煩曾，則當局應絕不存祖護之心，秉公處理，如知而庇際，或秘而不宜，則不但獎勵舞弊，抑且責在當局。同時，我們認為米統會各委員都應共同負責。一方面該會必須克盡採辦儲運配給的最高能率，使走私絕跡，黑市消滅，而每僩人都有最低限度的足食。</p>
<h3>日八十四屆議會決定今日起舉行　政府方面將提出增稅等案</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日本第八十四屆通常議會，二十四日舉行，日政府方面巳決定於茲議會中提出增稅法案等二十六件法案，該會方面亦積極協力政府努力完遂戰爭，故此此議會實為官民一體之必勝議曾。貴族院方面二十二日起已事先審查各議案，衆議院方面亦同時開始審查預備議案，復於二十一日舉行議院協議會，決定議會之　營方策答繼。二十三日舉行議員總會，由阿部總裁指定議員及出席此次通常議會之地度及方針。按此次日本之通常議會，對於增產軍需尤其對於飛機之增產對策等及確保食糧等，乃官民一體集思廣意之絕好議會，首相於議會中之施政方針演說及預算總會或其他質問等，均將本此基本方針而行，故第八四屆議會時，戰時施政之强力推進定有莫大貢獻。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日大政　贊會　阿部總裁，二十二日下午二時在　贊會代會議席上發表演說，理言此次日本第八十四皆通常議會乃確實處理百政及整備大東亞決戰體制之重大議會，茲錄其大意如次：此次議會所負之使命，在從速整備大東亞決戰體制，增強日本戰力，以粉碎敵人之反攻，開始必勝之途徑，而完成建設大東亞共樂團之偉業。在戰局現階段中，增强戰力實為當前之急務，就軍需而言，當以增產飛機為最，他如確保國民生活力，當以確保食糧為重要，現代戰爭中，空軍巳居最重要之地位，此一觀波島及吉島各戰役我軍所收獲之戰果，即可明瞭，是故吾人必須舉其全力，增產飛機及培費其技術人材。又對於民食問題，自當確保自給自足，故今後吾人自應協力政府，推進各種努力，求其充實，政府自開戰以來，已將第一年首先奠定戰略必勝之基礎，第二年則完成大東亞全域必勝之政治協助地，同以往數次通常議會，臨時議會切實實現此等施　措置，使某收獲效果。今日我國之戰時體態，在其規模上巳略予整備，總之，今後政府及國民更應發揮其全能，俾收獲圓滿之成果，政府行將向議會提出之諸法案，均為現戰局下所必當有者，故吾人於議會中審議各該案時，若思及其對戰局之利益，則不業深感吾人責任之重大，惟在當前之情勢下，百政之從速實行，乃屬必要，故在議會中之審議亦然。政府宜將當前時局之情勢切實闡明，率直披瀝其抱負，以求議會之衷心協贊，而議會亦當洞察當前緊迫之情勢，迅速審議，以促進政府決戰措置之實行</p>
<h3>日政府增強軍力　應付大東亞決戰　內地人徵兵年齡降低一年</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日情報局二十三日下午三時三十分發表稱：日政府此次為適應當前各種決定，于昭和十九年度對內地人徵兵年。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日政府為積極充實日軍戰力，以應付大東亞戰爭最後之決戰，決定將內地人之征兵年齡降低一年，凡于十九年滿二十歲之壯丁，同時學征兵檢查，關於此事之勅令「征兵年齡臨時特例」陸軍省法令「關於昭和十九年度征兵事務特例」，決定於二十四日以官報頒布，即日付之施行。現在世界各國之征兵年齡，皆早于日本，如英美自十八歲起，蘇聯將巳召集十六歲之少年使用於第一綫，現僅有日本在本年九月三十日始取消　居外國者之征兵檢查延期制，十月二日停止學生延期征服制，十一月一日將兵役年齡延長至四十五歲。日本自建軍以來，始終堅持傳統的　兵年齡為二十就，此次採取此種措置，大足證明日本人力有餘裕，同時亦為應付將來戰局之需者。最近日本壯丁未滿徵兵年齡，而自頭為現役兵者，較中日事變以前增加三倍，是以此次之年齡降低措置，實乃適應戰時下之靑少年盡忠報國之熱誠。至於此次之改正，雖發於戰爭局勢之推移，而以增張日眾戰力為目的，然對於典綜合戰向有重大關係之生產戰，及國民生活，亦曾加以深切之考慮，盗此次之徵兵檢查，較例年提早半月，於全國各地一齊實施，因十九歲與二十歲者，同時受槍入管也，此對於重娑生產部門另其他方面之影響甚大，故關於此事曾加以愼重之考慮，大體二十歲者較例年提早入營兩三月·彼等入營受訓完畢後，則使十九歲名入營，故在實質上，雖謂徵兵年齡降低一年，然壯丁入營年，則提前數月。又對於完成戰爭有直接重大關係之生產部門從業者，現在考慮一種特別措置，擬花對於軍事上不發生坊碍之範圍內，使共一般入營者延遲若干時日入營。</p>
<h3>日飛機生產量　明年將大增　遠藤中將述計劃大要</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日軍需省航空兵器總局長官遠藤中將，二十二日於地方長官會議席上，說明來年度生產計劃之大要稱：大東亞戰局今已遜入決戰階段，敵方之執拗反攻，愈形織烈，刻正展開一大情耗戰。自現代戰之特質而言，無論敵我均以飛機為決戰之主體，今我舉國上下從事飛機化產，斷不容絲毫之偷安茍且，於最短期間內，大量製造飛機、乃我國推行戰爭之至上要求。明年度生產計劃，基於國家之般切要求，乃以充分發揮航空戰力為目標，故其生產量一須較本年度增產數倍。</p>
<h3>臨時地方長官　會議圓滿終了</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日本臨時地方長官會議，二十二日於緊張空氣中舉行竣事，會期雖僅一日，而巳獲得成果，長日上午為東條首相之訓示及軍需生產關係長官之說明。下午一時半起繼續舉行，由地方長官表明意見，並提出質疑。由東條首相及各省大臣關係長官等解答，尤對增强戰力，洪出木材，增進能率，調整勞務，利用女子勞務供出及生產食糧各種生產設施及福利設施，動員休關機械總工廠與區力工廠之關係，調頓製造各機關與官　之連絡，徵用勞務等問題，開誠實　解答，迄四時暫時休息。四時十分繼續舉行，由陸軍省佐藤軍務局長就國民動員與軍動員之關係及各國之實况詳細加以說明，繼由小泉厚相就人力開題說明日本較外國占極大優位，旋再由東條首相闡述所感，激勵各長官，最後由大達東京都長官代表全國地方長官致詞，今後暫更進一步努力，迄六時二十分會議圓滿終了。</p>

<h3>欲抑平物價須先促進物資交流　中行顧問木村博士談話</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　安定民生與振興經濟，首在物資　之合理的抑制，為解決此戰時下這重要問題，應分從物資　通貨兩方面實施强力對策，據中央儲備銀行顧問木村增太郎博士意見，認目前中國抑制物價之第一要點，在於促進物資交流，同時尤望民間方面認識時局，積極協力，茲誌木村博士談話大意如次：所謂通貨膨帳為在戰時下困生產力擴充之信用膨脹與物資補給不均衡所造成之現象，然以華中之實情言，不能認為通貨過剩，是故物價高漲之原因，並非如一般人所謂係由於通貨膨脹之影響，實由於物資關係與心理影響。蓋物資偏於一方不能圓滑交流，當然造成物價的賤貴，同時通貨亦因而膨脹，此種原因與結果之逆行，可謂為華中物價之特徴，現在中儲券流通之區域，事變前所流通之通貨量約有七億元，與此時比較，雖現在物價極度上漲，但儲備劵之發行額，尙屬少數，由此而觀，華中物價之構成，亦不能謂由於通貨膨脹。至於如何解決目下之物價問題，實為吾人之重大使命，故保持物資與通貨相互之關聯與運用强力之政策，誠為根本要策。自通貨方面而觀，收回通貨與統制金融，以限制放款辦法，此屬於物價對策中之　極方面者，如日本政經力量合為一體，强力推行收囘資金，則發行國債公債，增强貯蓄，即可期成功。但中國之情形並不如此。再由物資關係觀之，當此有外部輸入日趨困難之時，首當促進物資交流之圓滑化，同時刺激生產，如生產振與後通貨當然增大，而收囘資金方面可不用金塊，而以物資推行，由此可使經濟安定並促進收買，一方能收囘通貨，促進收買即可推行生產、此種物價問題係在此一貫之連　中構成者，須綜合的普　推行。其成果實可期待，但關於此點，除國家之政治力外，若無民間方面之有力協力，亦不能完成。中央儲備銀行前為協力商統會之收買物資，辦理票據貼現，以流通資金，其效果有三：第一為確定資金用途，防止囤積投機等不正當行為，第二促進收囘資金，第三促進資金囘轉，但此等工作在物價對策之　點上，尙僅分擔其一部份，要言之，為圖促進物資交流，運用通貨對策，實為物價對策之要締。又儲備銀行之業務方針，今後亦將於此方向上實施。</p>
<h3>「世界現勢與大東亞戰爭」日天羽總裁發表演說</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日本靑少年團月例總崛起常會，二十二日全國一齊舉行，東京區域則假半島區公會堂舉行戰時靑年常會，日天羽情報局總裁在該常令中演講，　為「世界現勢與大東亞戰爭」，茲節其要旨如次：</p>

<p>美之侵略</p>
<p>榨取屍手中解放，各得取所，乃期完成新世界秩序。英·美之政策欲獨個別天下，以支配世界，為抑制日本及德　之抬產學研，而進用一切　謀，並為備萬一起見，而準備戰爭，美國於前年日·美交涉時，企圖施行經濟壓迫，以使日本屈服，但巳洞悉日本必不受範，戰爭通牒，其後三日即二十九日，美國務卿　　向英大使哈里法克斯表明稱：「美國與日本之關係，在外交方面巳經結束，現事態巳委之陸海軍當局手中」，美政府將此通牒送與日本後，同時幷　令各軍當局作</p>
<p>戰鬥準備</p>
<p>眞珠海之役，決非日本之偷襲，全屬於防衛夏威夷責任者之疏忽職務。此次歐洲戰爭勃發之際，德國連戰連捷，蓆捲歐陸及北非，最近反軸心方面巳發動反攻，同時英美又大肆宣傳，謂德國即將崩潰，但德國在東部戰綫迄今並無重大變化，在義大利戰綫，英美軍當初雖　得勢，但其後即遲遲不能進展。又巴爾幹方面德國先發制人佔領　羅　摩斯羣島，以備英·美由東地中海方面進擊？又將大西洋迄　威北岸一帶要塞化，故敵縱企圖建立第二戰綫，法局亦將重入在鄧扣克之覆撤而巳。因此，英首相邱吉爾於十一月十日演說稱：英·美於一九四四年將有更大之犧牲。又東亞　面英美亦</p>
<p>一再呼號</p>
<p>將自西南太平洋·南太乎洋·緬甸及中國大陸方面，實行反攻或進攻日本土，並巳首自所羅門，吉爾貝特方面開始反攻，但經六次之波根維爾島海面空戰與四次之吉爾貝特羣島海空戰後，敵人巳遭受深痛之打擊，致使羅斯福與諾克斯等對波根維爾島作戰前發表之自借言詞朱能實現。今者英·美兩國國內巳充滿反對現政當局之聲氣，羅斯福為明年度大總統改選時再得獲選，乃力　獲取戰果，藉以造其鞏固之地位：邱吉爾亦然，藉戰果以奠定共政治之立塲，惟英屬　度之獨立鬥爭，與美國內黑人之人種問題，巳遂漸表面化，加之英美於此次戰爭中，人力損失過重，僅亡於日軍之手者，巳約達四十萬，英美當局對此雖竭力加以掩飾，但人民不安興動搖之心情，仍日為增高，再加經濟上與社會上之一般不良現象，故兩國國民</p>
<p>厭戰心情</p>
<p>巳日趨　著。此外，更因美國加强對英國殖民地之干涉，致使英·美間之摩擦日深，而英·美之對蘇關係，亦日見複雜微妙，再觀大東亞各民族之團結日堅，大東亞之建設亦逐步進展，是以英美頗為憂慮，極思在此大東亞建設基礎尙未鞏固之前，　其野心，故乃戰鬥與宣傳倂施。如開羅及德黑蘭等會談，即其一例，但此舉終歸失敗，即英·美國內一般與論，亦對此大加指摘。再觀北非與義本土方面，於北非英·美會變動法維希政府副全席達期使其謀反，藉以搖撼法軍，但事成後猶將　　暗殺，再如巴特里爽今日巳不被英美視為對手，僅為一賣國奴而巳、刻巳步入其應有之運命，英·美為達到目的而不擇手段，不惜蹂躪人道，如利用空襲，破壞都市，殺傷無辜平民，欲使其敵國人昭於恐怖而降伏，即其一例。又如日醫院船為英·美所擊沉者，巳達十二艘，此全為英·美蔑視國際法與</p>
<p>正義人道</p>
<p>之暴行，實神人所不容，我人實不能不予以澈底　懲之，美國方面現因戰爭延長，其國民對戰爭前途　念益深，　英·美實不知為何而戰也。此次戰爭實乃英·美為征服世界所　動之反乎正義之戰爭，故羅斯福亦無正當之戰爭名目·彼似曾考慮「為生存而戰」之名目、但因此次戰爭幷非名正言順之戰爭，故實難便名實一致。當英國對德作戰之初，當謂此次戰爭乃為擁護波蘭·捷克斯拉失暨東歐各小國之存在而戰，但時至今日，其對各小國之態度實曖昧不明。又英·美過去曾以大西洋憲零倡言領土不擴大主義，民族自決主義，但時至今日·英·美竟蔑視歐洲各小國之權利，且企圖擴大領土，而完全反乎其最初之主張·英·美於</p>
<p>戰爭初起</p>
<p>時，曾亟謀呈其野心為時旣久，其野心乃畢露，開羅會談時，英·美言表明奪取日本領土，降日本為三等國及奴化果亞民族之意圖。猶億三十年　北京·天津之稅關俱樂部及上海公園入口處，曾書有「華人與狗不得入內」標誌，英·美以如此態度加諸日本與中國，而謀東亞論為奴隸之境地，反之，日本戰爭目的，則為防止英·美侵略大東亞各國，確保大東亞之安定，進而維持世界之和平。換言之，即為使大東亞民族脫却英·美之桎梏，共國建設正義之世界，故大東亞各國家各民族乃一致奮起，決心與日本共同完遂戰爭，努力從事大東亞共　　之建設。前此大東亞會議及大東亞共同宜言，即此種精神之表現，大東亞宣言及建設大東亞之大憲章，重建世界之金字塔，我大東亞民族　為實現此</p>
<p>偉大宣言</p>
<p>而點，必須努力獲得此次戰爭之勝利，此次諸君參加大東亞靑少年總電起運動，與中國及滿洲携手向戰爭目的邁進，期建設基於道義之大東亞，實可謂崇高之使命，希緒君益努力奮門，以達成此大使命也。</p>
<h3>東綫南部德軍分三路進攻中部方面亦有劇戰</h3>
<p>瑞與京城二十三日中央社電　昨夜莫斯科情報局最後公吿，承認德軍在東綫三路進攻，　透露德軍昨在基洛伏格勒四南柯爾斯頓區內之齊洛平西南地區，以步兵及坦克進攻，紅軍竭力應戰。昨夜一英通信員自莫斯科報告，內容與蘇情報相同，謂德軍在基洛伏格勒與克里伏伊羅格之間，企圖以　形部隊衛入紅軍防綫，於聶伯河套之基洛伕格勒東南猛烈進攻，德軍井由其他區城調來大批坦克及步兵，以事增援。又稱：白俄羅斯綫之南端，德軍在齊洛平之西　推進，以增其反攻壓力，以德軍指抑之　較南地區以事進攻一點推之，其計劃似希望歷迫分布於　　陣綫上之紅軍，向聶伯河方面後退</p>
<p>柏林二十三中央社電　海運社軍事訪員　托留斯稱：數週來東綫南部戰局，除德軍增加壓力外，實際上並無變化，東綫中部，蘇軍向納伏爾維特勃斯克方面增派生力軍助戰，蘇軍攻勢巳進入新階段，自十月杪至十二月中旬，該處戰况沉寂，於謹愼之準備後，目前巳進行大規　之進攻，此項運用精銳部隊之進攻，或係蘇軍冬季大攻勢之先聲，蘇軍將在該處進攻，殆無疑義。目前蘇軍壓力集中於維特勃斯克方面，蘇軍自東面對德軍陣地作正面進攻，並自北面進行側　包抄，刻在劇戰中，蘇軍於前日以優勢之兵力深人德軍陣地，德軍反攻奪囘失地之一部份，蘇軍未能　破德軍防綫，東綫也處總軍頗為得手，德軍在　各平與萊契薩間進攻，　　蘇軍一師，德軍陣綫缺口一處巳塡平。蒂托黑夫方面，德軍先鋒頗有進　，蘇軍猛烈反攻巳被擊退，聶伯河套之德軍，在基洛伏格勒東南進攻，頗有進展，聶伯河下流戰况無雙化，蘇軍進攻尼柯波爾德軍橋頭堡，迄未獲逞。寇爾森方面戰况沉寂，但蘇軍精銳集中該處，殆將在冰上過河。</p>

<h3>日機大舉襲昆明機塲　擊毀渝機四十架</h3>
<p>東京廿三日中央社電　日大本營廿三日下午三時卅分發表，帝國陸軍航空部隊，曾於十二月廿二日下午以戰門轟炸機聯合編隊，火舉急襲昆明機塲，掃除渝戰鬥機約四十架之執拗阻碍，轟炸地上果結中之渝機，迄現在止，判明戰果如次：擊落戰鬥機二十六架，（內八架未證實）炸毀大型機六架，小型機八架，計四十架，我機自炸及未返基地考計四架。</p>
<p>中國　綫某基地廿三日中央社電　據日陸軍機隊會於十八日十九日兩日　襲昆明雲南，渝軍基地，復於廿二日下午三度强襲渝軍西南地區最大據點昆明之機塲，渝方似早巳察知日機之來襲，故當日機飛抵昆明上空時，巳有渝方P49型P150製P38型機等戰鬥機約四十架應戰，日機當即與之展開空戰。結果擊落其廿六架，復猛炸停放地上之渝機計有大型者六架，小型者八架，被炸起火，是役共計擊落擊毀敵機四十架，美駐渝空軍前巳將渝空軍收為自有，故此次擊落者約半數為渝空軍之舊式機。按渝機於第一綫者約三百架乃至四百架，但在常德之役巳喪失八十四架。於十八日十九日兩日日機襲昆明雲南時又被日機擊落擊毀三十二架、今復被日機殲滅其四十架、是故自十一月初旬以來之短期間內，渝方第一綫飛機巳喪失其大半矣。又如廿二日之役，渝方於日機飛抵昆明上空前二十分鐘即以戰鬥機於空中戒備，以待邀　日機來襲，但日機終將其戒備綫突破、敢然施行强襲，而收獲莫大戰果，足　日機戰鬥精神及戰門技術之超越矣。</p>

<h3>沅江戰綫日軍威力</h3>
<p>漢口二十十三日中央社電　據華中前綫某基地電，此次作戰中日陸軍航空部隊之活躍，極為顯著，所有前綫各處均於日軍制空　下，當沅江防綫攻略戰漸形激烈之際，美空軍曾為協力渝軍漸入日軍醫備網展開游擊式之活動，但經日機數次猛炸其基地，並於戰塲上空展開空戰，巳足使美空軍膽戰心驚，故日軍部隊因有日航空部隊協力，戰無不克。目前敵軍對日軍之進攻，極形恐怖，日機一日出現於戰塲，敵機旋即望風　逃，尤其沅江要塞綫之攻略戰及對第一次之常德附近　滅戰，實已發揮陸空一體之威力，其後并於西部戰綫舟　上部隊，協力制壓巴山山系上空猛炸被日軍包圍之敵軍，將其擊來。</p>

<h3>廣田情報部長　分析歐美情勢　剖解英美卑鄙思想</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於南非聯邦史末資首相，在英帝國議會協會英國支部席上，所發表之「新歐洲論」演說，主張戰後英美蘇造成三位一體之形式，日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，特於昨（廿三）日下午三時在定例報道常會席上發表談話，並分析歐美情勢，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>英美卑鄙思想</p>
<p>廣田部長首謂：關於史宋資之新歐洲論內容，足見央美思想卑鄙。廣田氏旋又根據史末資之新歐洲論予以剖析，如反軸心打倒軸心後，助世界勢力範圍，可分為以蘇聯中心之共產主義，及英美之資本主義，是以世界大勢，即為此兩個主義作為範圍，於是正義之國家消　，更無獨立國家。是項思想，不但在於英一國，而在全世界反軸心方面，抱有此項思想者亦頗多。美沃特里波亦曾發表同樣之語訓，而美華　萊斯副總統，亦對此有相同之思想，謂此兩個實力階段，於第二次世界大戰結束後，將來　必更發生第三次世界戰爭，其目標即以蘇為中心之共產主義，及英美之資本主義發生磨擦後之衝突。我人觀測華萊斯副總統之言論，即已無民主主義，更否認小國之存在，而史末資之新歐洲論，則在第二次世界戰爭後，情形當同，無意承認小國之存在外，更無意希望任何國家之獨立，斯即為英美思想之企求，是以諸君當特別注意者，維指出史未資發表之新歐洲論所言之三位一體主張，即英美蘇三國也。我人就世界戰局上以觀英在第二次世界戰爭中，戰敗當全體消滅，縱告勝利，亦為美國所吸收，故英國之命運如此，按史本為英國籍，在眩論文中，特別强調英國之癥結，所謂三位一戕之國家，在此次世界戰爭後，英國將不能存在，即如有成立之可能，則亦為二位一體，為美蘇二國之存在。廣田氏乃對戰後之美國存在，及其動向，作詳切之剖解。</p>
<p>排美經濟榨取</p>
<p>謂關於美戰後之動向，我人可觀測具體事實，本月二十日南美玻利維亞發生改變，巳足可證明美國情形。玻國民。軍部·及前進份子·對政府表示不滿外，且用武力揩毀政府，從新建立新政府。根據所發表之總網，為喚起世界民衆注意，應擴充玻國內之資源，及充裕玻之民生利用之，是以此點我人應特別注意者，按照玻國內經濟力量以觀，故在玻所發表之總綱上，巳題見決意為排除美國之經濟榨取。原來現之產業為錫·銅。鎢。礦產·以鑛產為主立國，惟玻國之礦產，向為美資本所開發，尤以自大東亞戰爭發生後，美喪失馬來錫礦市塲，乃僅賴玻之錫礦，為美經濟榨取更厲。第二所需注意者。玻新政府所發表之政策，聲明外交政策並無變更，尤其對美國關係未為變動，在此情形下，不無矛盾。查美國輿南美關係，在政治經濟上，向為美覇制優勢地位，並誇示南美與各國不能脫離美國及反對美國，但在實際上而觀，南美各國，實不願為美國榨取及壓道，南美民衆思想反美頗衆，時有企圖作脫離美國，及謀取獨立，此項思想連動之熾烈，最近返為展開。</p>
<p>反美情勢熾烈</p>
<p>旋將南美民衆反美事實舉例如下：謂本年夏季，美華萊斯副總理赴南美旅行，在各地公關舉行演講，遭遇意外不滿情形頗多。時有南美民衆羣呼打倒金元外交口號，華迫不得巳，不樂而歸，是以南美民衆反美情勢，足見蔥趨熾烈。在南美反美國家著稱者，首以阿根廷，次為玻利維亞，哥崙比亞，巴拉圭，智利等國。阿至今維持中立，其次在表面，雖為置身於反軸心方面，但內心則排美思想，頗為激烈，其他南美各國，莫不大同小異。目前戰局，既屬長期，故美國對南美之經濟榨取，日益强厲，而美對南美之援助，日漸縮小，是南美各國，求脫離美國　　者，日益加强，此余當可斷言者，此種事實，不但在中南美各國，反美帝國主義熾烈而在伊期，伊拉克，印度等，亦當發生，故史末資之發表新歐洲論之主張消減小國，美國制　世界夢想、當遭受世界各國之反對，以歸失敗。此項事實、我人當可觀及者，此外美國之輕視大東亞各國，及英美制　大東亞之慾望，日本當用武力打破彼　之夢想，直至歸於失敗而後巳云云。</p>
<h3>共舞臺案殉職官警羅君強贈賻十萬元　張善琨贈賻三十一萬元</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本月十九日第八區共舞畫附近官警殉職事件，茲悉中央我警學校兼敎育長羅君强氏，以此次衝突事件，無論安任誰屬，念在同舟一體之誼，不勝哀悼，出事之後，偕稅警總團副總團長能劍東，一苒與陳市長及第一警察局蘇副局長接洽，開誠佈公，暢談一切，並於昨日以稅警總團全體官兵名義，賻贈死塲官警國幣十萬元，並聞羅敎育長曾於昨日上午，偕同蘇副局長，分赴廣慈醫院及仁濟醫院慰問受塲者，又共舞臺主人張善琨氏，以此次事件，肇因於該臺，表示十分悼惜，賻贈殉職官警家屬國幣三十一萬元，函送治喪委員會收轉。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>煤球新限價以後</h3>
<p>近來本市百物得價狂漲之中，又以燃料的形勢為最嚴重，致令全市居民，大有遠　不可終日之慨，現在本市經濟當局已將煤球限價，酌予調整，其送到用戶者，每噸國幣一千二百六十元，所有煤　成份，一律以煤層百分之五十為標準。如此一來，今後煤球算是重新有了公定價格及品質標準了，祇是歷來事實告訴我們，公定價格為一事，購買有無困難，又為一事，品質是否合於標準，又為一事；由於第二點及第三點，尤其是第二貼，發生問題，遂使限價等於具文，而黑市隨以猖獗了；黑市既成為日用燃料惟一仰給的泉源，乃更加以有料不製，有貨不售的居奇行為，無怪其結果遂至不堪設想了。</p>
<p>我們所渴望於煤球新限價以後者為：　在實施配給方面，必須責令全市各煤球商，袛可按照新限價出售，不准同時進行一切非法交易，那宋，煤球價格，自可自然地歸納於公定價格的範園了，　在疏通來源方面，必須同時積極從事於各地區煤鑛之增產，有如實業部最近招待中外記者所稱饅頭山煤礦公司。明年一月後，每日可出煤一百噸至一百五十噸，安徽烈山煤礦公司，新江長興煤礦公司蘊藏均富，現巳擬具開發方案，籌備進行。這方是解決燃料恐慌之基層工作。</p>
<h3>加強蔴類統治　制定移動辦法</h3>
<p>政府以蔴類及其製品為重要物資之一，關係軍需及民生至為密切，為加强統制起見，巳成立蔴業同業聯合會，並依據戰時物資移動取締暫行條例第四條之規定，對蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩市蔴類及蔴製品之移動，巳制定移動取締臨時辦法云。</p>
<h3>五年來新創銀行　一百十八家</h3>
<p>滬市金融事業，近數牛來，殊稱畸形繁榮，新創金融機關如雨後春筍，國府當局為安定金融防杜不法奸商擾亂金融起見，目財政部頃布辦法，實施管理後，本市各金融機關組織巳日臻健全，據記者調查所悉，上海特別市銀仃業同業公會，現有會員銀行共達一百七十家，其中商業儲蓄銀行五十二家，各業自設之銀行三十四家，收受存款及放款之普通銀行八十四家，自事變前至二十七年止，舊有銀行為五卞二家，近五年夾新開設者達一百十八家。</p>
<h3>八區營業證書　辦理申請</h3>

<h3>洛陽路上一醫院　上海南洋醫院參觀</h3>
<p>仁心仁術和善行</p>
<p>醫療業務是社會事業，以救人為最高目標，雖然在現在社會尙不能盡如理想，但是每一個眞正的醫師護士及醫療事業家，都必須本仁心，施仁術以救大衆為其最祟高的理想，決不能計較金錢的報酬或營業性的利潤。在這裏顧醫師談起該院最近的一件新聞。他有，前一個月的某天深夜，送來一位急性的病人張龍文君，經駐院主任醫師的診斷，是TB性腸，阻塞症，同時，還有肺病，及結核性腹膜炎，實在因為病人太窮，一挨再挨，至陷於如此嚴重狀態，纔湊了些錢送院求治的。病雖未至完全絕望，但醫療却很不容易，當然必須住院，可是病人沒有足夠的能力，救濟　？在這時代那裏有這筆經費，因為一住院療養，像這種病，醫藥費上萬乃至數萬是毫不足奇的哪！，可是，如果拒絕了，那豈非和拒絕其最後一綫生機一樣？何况，經過查詢，這位張君，曾有其光輝的歷史，為了國族和社會，他才由高等階層陷於今日這樣窮迫的！而且現在還只是三十多歲的壯年，他還有遠大的前途，從公理人情言，這樣為民族與社會而貧窮的人，怎麽可以坐視其死亡而不一援手？從國家社會言，更必須予以全力救助才是。因此，南洋醫院當局決定先行救其危險，不問其有無繳費能力，三等病房客滿就送二等，二等也無床位，就送頭等。施行大小手術，　去病腸、同時診治其他附屬諸病，經過一個多月，總算奪回性命而且可以自由行動了，醫療，手術，病房，膳食等費不計，單只特殊藥品所費，已達一萬數千元！然而，病者既然確實無力繳費，連什麽保證也不需要，讓他抱着滿腔愉快囘去，等待將來為國家社會做更多有益的事業。</p>
<p>關於貧病的救助，當然是醫院及醫師們應有的道德。不過，由於私營醫院，力量有限，在救助之間，當然也不能不稍加考慮。顧醫師談起他們對於貧苦病者的態度，第一，凡貧病者來院診治病患，一切診斷及用藥，及一切診治上必要的手續，概與貧病以外之病者一視同仁。但如用藥過於貴重者，仍須酌量收囘一部份成本</p>

        <h1>1943.12.24</h1>
<h3>Expectations of the Rice Control Committee</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, businesses are, as usual, settling accounts, and the circulation of money becomes tight. Logically, goods should be sold off to raise cash, and prices should fall. However, recently, prices have instead risen, and the rising trend is sharp, similar to previous fluctuations. Upon investigation, we believe that this price increase is stimulated by the rise in rice and coal prices, because rice and coal are the most essential of basic necessities. We cannot live a day without rice and coal. The price of rice and coal increases, and then all prices and wages follow suit, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>We base our argument on the aforementioned reasons for the rise in prices, and believe that the focus of suppressing prices should be on rice and coal. The Municipal Price Review Committee held a meeting yesterday to plan emergency countermeasures, and we will provide our opinions and contribute our reference for implementation. Today, we will first discuss the issue of rice, and then express our views again, in order to arouse the sense of responsibility of the authorities.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a metropolis that does not produce rice itself. Its five million people rely entirely on the surrounding rural areas and rice-producing regions. No matter how insufficient the rice ration is, no matter how difficult the transportation is, it is rare to see people starving to death among the five million population. Observers often say that this is thanks to the continuous supply of smuggled black market rice. We advocate eliminating smuggling and eradicating the black market. If the source is cut off, wouldn't the citizens of Shanghai starve to death? Actually, that is not the case. We advocate eliminating smuggling and replacing it with public transportation; we advocate eradicating the black market and replacing it with official prices. By reducing the exploitation of smuggling and the black market, both producers and consumers can benefit. This task should be fully undertaken by the Rice Control Committee.</p>
<p>The duties prescribed for the Rice Control Committee are procurement, preparation for transportation, and distribution. Objectively speaking, it is insufficient to talk about the entire meaning of "control" and to complete the mission of "control" without these three duties. To be honest, rice control is a major event that affects the common interests of the people. It is definitely not an ordinary government agency that goes through the motions. It is an autonomous organization entrusted by the government to the people to handle. If it fails, it will not only fail to answer to the government and the public, but also fail to address the future of the people's autonomy. Therefore, once it accepts the task, it must assume absolute responsibility.</p>
<p>Currently, all five million citizens of Shanghai can obtain rice, which fully proves that the problem does not lie in the difficulty of rice supply and transportation. Furthermore, the household rice in Shanghai can be fully rationed. The current insufficient rationing and rampant black market are due to the failure of the Rice Control Committee to fulfill its responsibilities. After the rice from smuggling and the black market is passed through the Rice Control Committee and becomes publicly transported and officially priced rice, wouldn't it be enough for rationing?</p>
<p>Recently, we have received reports from various sources that there have been instances of fraud in the issuance of procurement certificates by the Rice Control Committee, and intentional delays in payments to legitimate procurement merchants, which has caused complaints. Considering the past malpractices in grain administration and the current attempt to illegally profit from the disparity between official and black market prices, we cannot help but take a reserved attitude and urge the authorities of the Rice Control Committee to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter impartially.</p>
<p>The Cotton Management Office of the National Commercial Control Committee recently investigated and punished its staff for malpractice. We request that the facts of the punishment be announced to the public, so that those who disregard the law will know what to fear. At the same time, we hope that the Rice Control Committee will be awed by the arduousness of its responsibility, strictly admonish its staff, and abide by the law. For those who neglect their duties, there should be no leniency. Punish one as a warning to a hundred, and preserve the face of the people's autonomous organization. We expressed our trust in Director Yuan's past history when the Rice Control Committee was first established, and repeatedly offered serious and law-abiding suggestions on personnel issues in order to promote attention. Now, unfortunately, there have been complaints from the outside world, so the authorities should not have any intentions of shielding them and should handle the matter impartially. If they know about it and protect them, or keep it secret and do not publicize it, then they will not only be encouraging malpractice, but also be responsible for it. At the same time, we believe that all members of the Rice Control Committee should be jointly responsible. On the one hand, the committee must do its utmost to procure, store, transport, and distribute rice at the highest efficiency, so that smuggling disappears, the black market is eliminated, and everyone has at least enough food.</p>
<h3>The 84th Session of the Japanese Diet Decides to Convene Today; The Government Will Submit Bills Such as Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The 84th ordinary session of the Japanese Diet will be held on the 24th. The Japanese government has decided to submit 26 bills, including a tax increase bill, to this session of the Diet. The Diet is also actively cooperating with the government to strive for the completion of the war. Therefore, this session of the Diet is a session of certain victory for the government and the people as one. The House of Peers has begun preliminary review of the bills from the 22nd, and the House of Representatives has also begun preliminary review of the preparatory bills at the same time. A Diet consultation was held on the 21st to determine the operating policies of the Diet. On the 23rd, a general meeting of Diet members was held, and President Abe designated the members and the degree and direction of attendance at this ordinary session of the Diet. According to this ordinary session of the Japanese Diet, it is an excellent meeting for the government and the people to gather ideas and opinions on measures such as increasing the production of military supplies, especially aircraft, and ensuring food supply. The Prime Minister's policy speech in the Diet and the budget general meeting or other questions will be conducted based on this basic policy. Therefore, the 84th session of the Diet will definitely make a great contribution to the strong promotion of wartime administration.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - President Abe of the Great Japan Assistance Association delivered a speech at the Assistance Association representative meeting hall at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, stating that this 84th session of the Japanese Diet is a major meeting to effectively handle the administration and prepare for the Greater East Asia decisive battle system. The gist of his speech is as follows: The mission of this session of the Diet is to quickly prepare the Greater East Asia decisive battle system, enhance Japan's war power to crush the enemy's counterattacks, start the path to certain victory, and complete the great task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the current stage of the war, enhancing war power is the most urgent task. In terms of military supplies, increasing the production of aircraft is the most important. Ensuring the vitality of the people's lives is important. In modern warfare, the air force has occupied the most important position. This can be clearly understood from the battle results achieved by our army in the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. Therefore, we must do our utmost to increase the production of aircraft and cultivate technical personnel. Also, for the people's food problem, we must ensure self-sufficiency. Therefore, we should cooperate with the government to promote various efforts to enrich it. Since the beginning of the war, the government has first laid the foundation for a strategically certain victory in the first year, and in the second year, it has completed the political assistance ground for certain victory in the entire Greater East Asia region. The previous ordinary sessions and temporary sessions have effectively implemented these measures, so that they have achieved results. Today, our country's wartime system has been slightly prepared in terms of its scale. In short, the government and the people should exert their full power to achieve satisfactory results. The bills that the government will submit to the Diet are all necessary under the current war situation. Therefore, when we deliberate on these bills in the Diet, if we think about their benefits to the war situation, we cannot but deeply feel the importance of our responsibility. However, under the current situation, the speedy implementation of the administration is necessary. Therefore, the deliberation in the Diet is also the same. The government should truly clarify the situation of the current situation and frankly express its aspirations to seek the heartfelt cooperation of the Diet, and the Diet should also understand the current urgent situation and quickly deliberate to promote the implementation of the government's decisive battle measures.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Strengthens Military Power to Cope with the Decisive Battle in Greater East Asia; The Conscription Age for Mainland Residents is Lowered by One Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd that the Japanese government will lower the conscription age for mainland residents in 1944 in order to adapt to various current decisions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - In order to actively enrich the war power of the Japanese army and cope with the final decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government decided to lower the conscription age for mainland residents by one year. All able-bodied men who turn 20 in 1944 will also undergo conscription medical examinations. The imperial order "Temporary Special Cases for Conscription Age" and the Army Ministry ordinance "Special Cases for Conscription Affairs in 1944" will be promulgated in the official gazette on the 24th and will be implemented on the same date. The conscription age in various countries around the world is earlier than Japan. For example, in Britain and the United States, it starts at the age of 18, and the Soviet Union has already called up 16-year-old teenagers for use on the front line. Only Japan canceled the postponement of conscription medical examinations for those residing abroad on September 30 this year, stopped the postponement of student conscription on October 2, and extended the military service age to 45 on November 1. Since the establishment of the Japanese army, it has always adhered to the traditional conscription age of 20. This measure proves that Japan has sufficient manpower and is also to meet the needs of the future war situation. Recently, the number of Japanese able-bodied men who have not reached the conscription age but voluntarily become active soldiers has increased three times compared to before the Sino-Japanese Incident. Therefore, this age reduction measure is actually to adapt to the patriotic enthusiasm of young people during wartime. As for this amendment, although it is based on the changes in the war situation and aims to increase the war power of the Japanese army, it has also been deeply considered in relation to production warfare, which has a significant relationship to comprehensive warfare, and the people's lives. The conscription medical examination this time will be carried out simultaneously in various parts of the country half a month earlier than usual, because those who are 19 and 20 years old will be subject to gun entry management at the same time. This will have a great impact on the important production sector and other aspects. Therefore, careful consideration has been given to this matter. Generally, those who are 20 years old will enter the camp two or three months earlier than usual. After they complete their training in the camp, those who are 19 years old will be allowed to enter the camp. Therefore, in essence, although it is said that the conscription age has been lowered by one year, the age of able-bodied men entering the camp will be advanced by several months. In addition, for workers in the production sector who have a direct and significant relationship with the completion of the war, a special measure is currently being considered, and it is planned to delay the entry of general entrants for a certain period of time within the scope that does not hinder military affairs.</p>
<h3>Japan's Aircraft Production Will Increase Greatly Next Year; Lieutenant General Endo Describes the Outline of the Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Endo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, explained the outline of the production plan for the coming year at the local governor's meeting on the 22nd, saying: The Greater East Asia war situation has now entered the decisive battle stage, and the enemy's stubborn counterattacks are becoming increasingly fierce, and a major attrition war is currently unfolding. In terms of the characteristics of modern warfare, both the enemy and ourselves use aircraft as the main body of the decisive battle. Now, our entire country is engaged in aircraft production, and we must not be complacent in the slightest. Mass production of aircraft in the shortest possible time is the supreme requirement for our country to carry out the war. The production plan for the coming year is based on the country's general requirements and aims to fully exert air power. Therefore, its production volume must be several times higher than this year.</p>
<h3>The Temporary Local Governor's Meeting Ends Successfully</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Temporary Local Governor's Meeting was held in a tense atmosphere on the 22nd and was completed. Although the meeting period was only one day, it has achieved results. In the morning, Prime Minister Tojo gave instructions and the ministers related to military production gave explanations. The meeting continued from 1:30 PM, with local governors expressing their opinions and raising questions. Prime Minister Tojo and the ministers related to various ministries answered questions frankly on issues such as enhancing war power, producing wood, increasing efficiency, adjusting labor, utilizing female labor supply and production of food, various production facilities and welfare facilities, the relationship between mobilized idle machinery general factories and district power factories, coordinating the connections between various manufacturing agencies and official offices, and requisitioning labor. The meeting took a temporary break at 4:00 PM. It continued at 4:10 PM, with Major General Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, explaining in detail the relationship between national mobilization and military mobilization and the actual situation in various countries. Then, Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi explained the manpower problem, stating that Japan has a great advantage over foreign countries. Then, Prime Minister Tojo elaborated on his feelings and encouraged the governors. Finally, Governor of Tokyo Odate gave a speech on behalf of the national local governors, stating that they would make further efforts in the future. The meeting ended successfully at 6:20 PM.</p>

<p>Hanoi, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the 17th, seven American planes from the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Lao Cai on the northern border of Vietnam.

He criticized Roosevelt and Churchill's advocacy of "unconditional surrender", believing that the attempt to conquer Germany and Japan is too costly and not worth the loss.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attacked Madagascar, Heavily Damaging Enemy Strongholds; At the Same Time, They Night-Attacked American Positions on Bougainville</h3>

(B) Canceled the sinking of two enemy anti-submarine boats and the heavy damage to one submarine.</p>

<h3>To Suppress Prices, It is Necessary to First Promote the Exchange of Goods; A Conversation with Dr. Kimura, Consultant of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Stabilizing people's livelihood and revitalizing the economy require the reasonable suppression of goods. To solve this important wartime problem, strong countermeasures should be implemented from both goods and currency aspects. According to the opinion of Dr. Kimura Masutaro, Consultant of the Central Reserve Bank, the first key point for China to suppress prices at present is to promote the exchange of goods. At the same time, it is hoped that the private sector will recognize the situation and actively cooperate. The main points of Dr. Kimura's conversation are recorded as follows: The so-called currency inflation is a phenomenon caused by the expansion of credit and the imbalance of goods supply during wartime, which hinders the expansion of productivity. However, judging from the actual situation in Central China, it cannot be considered that there is an excess of currency. Therefore, the reason for the high prices is not, as generally said, due to the impact of currency inflation, but due to goods relations and psychological effects. The fact that goods are biased towards one side and cannot be smoothly exchanged naturally creates expensive and cheap prices. At the same time, the currency also expands accordingly. This reversal of cause and effect can be said to be a characteristic of Central China's prices. In the area where the Central Reserve Bank notes are currently circulating, the amount of currency circulating before the incident was about 700 million yuan. Compared with this time, although the current prices have risen sharply, the amount of issuance of reserve notes is still small. From this point of view, the composition of prices in Central China cannot be said to be due to currency inflation. As for how to solve the current price problem, it is our important mission. Therefore, maintaining the mutual connection between goods and currency and implementing strong policies are fundamental strategies. From the currency aspect, recovering currency and controlling finance to restrict lending methods belong to the extreme aspects of price countermeasures. If Japan combines political and economic forces into one and strongly promotes the recovery of funds, then the issuance of national bonds and public bonds and the increase in savings can be expected to succeed. But the situation in China is not like this. From the perspective of goods relations, when external input is becoming increasingly difficult, the first thing to do is to promote the smooth exchange of goods, while stimulating production. If production is revitalized, the currency will naturally increase, and the recovery of funds can be promoted with goods instead of gold. This can stabilize the economy and promote procurement. On the one hand, it can recover currency, and promoting procurement can promote production. This price problem is constructed in this consistent connection and must be comprehensively promoted. Its results can be expected, but regarding this point, in addition to the political power of the country, it cannot be completed without the strong cooperation of the private sector. The Central Reserve Bank previously handled bill discounting to circulate funds in order to cooperate with the commercial association's procurement of goods. The effect has three points: the first is to determine the use of funds and prevent improper behaviors such as hoarding and speculation; the second is to promote the recovery of funds; and the third is to promote the turnover of funds. However, this kind of work only undertakes a part of the price countermeasures. In short, to promote the exchange of goods and use currency countermeasures is the key to price countermeasures. The business policy of the Reserve Bank will also be implemented in this direction in the future.</p>
<h3>"World Situation and the Greater East Asia War" Speech by President Amano of the Japan Information Bureau</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The monthly general mobilization meeting of the Japan Youth Corps was held simultaneously nationwide on the 22nd. In the Tokyo area, the wartime youth meeting was held at the Public Hall in the Peninsula District. President Amano of the Japan Information Bureau gave a speech at the meeting titled "World Situation and the Greater East Asia War." The following is a summary of his main points:</p>
<p>On December 7, Showa 16 (1941), the world faced a critical juncture. Japan, Germany, and Italy aimed to liberate the various ethnic groups of the world from the aggression and</p>
<p>exploitation of the United States and Great Britain</p>
<p>and enable them to obtain what they deserve, thereby completing a new world order. The policies of Great Britain and the United States sought to monopolize the world and dominate it. To suppress the rise of Japan and Germany in academia and research, they used all sorts of</p>
<p>schemes, and they prepared for war in anticipation of any eventuality. During the negotiations between Japan and the United States the year before, the United States attempted to exert economic pressure to force Japan to submit, but it was clear that Japan would not be restrained. The war ultimatum was issued three days later, on the 29th, when the U.S. Secretary of State</p>
<p>informed the British Ambassador Halifax, stating, "The relationship between the United States and Japan has ended in diplomatic terms, and the current situation has been entrusted to the army and navy authorities." After sending this ultimatum to Japan, the U.S. government simultaneously</p>
<p>ordered its military authorities to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>The attack on Pearl Harbor was by no means a Japanese sneak attack but entirely due to the negligence of those responsible for defending Hawaii. When the European war broke out, Germany won successive victories, sweeping across Europe and North Africa. Recently, the anti-Axis powers have launched a counteroffensive, and Great Britain and the United States have loudly proclaimed that Germany is about to collapse. However, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front in Germany. On the Italian front, although the Anglo-American forces initially gained some momentum, they have since been unable to make further progress. Furthermore, in the Balkans, Germany preemptively occupied the islands of</p>
<p>Leros and Samos to prepare for an Anglo-American attack from the eastern Mediterranean. Germany has also fortified the Atlantic coast up to the northern coast of Norway, so even if the enemy attempts to establish a second front, they will repeat the retreat at Dunkirk. Therefore, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech on November 10 that Great Britain and the United States will have to make even greater sacrifices in 1944. In the East Asian</p>
<p>theater, Great Britain and the United States have repeatedly called out that</p>
<p>they will launch a counteroffensive or offensive against the Japanese mainland from the southwestern Pacific, the South Pacific, Burma, and mainland China. They have already begun their counteroffensive from the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands. However, after six naval and air battles off Bougainville Island and four naval and air battles in the Gilbert Islands, the enemy has suffered a severe blow, causing Roosevelt and Knox to be unable to realize the boastful words they had made before the Bougainville Island operation. Currently, the domestic atmosphere in both Great Britain and the United States is filled with voices opposing the current authorities. Roosevelt is striving to win another election as president next year, so he is trying hard to secure war achievements to consolidate his position. Churchill is doing the same, using war achievements to establish his political standing. However, the independence struggle in British</p>
<p>India and the racial problems of blacks in the United States have gradually surfaced. In addition, Great Britain and the United States have suffered excessive manpower losses in this war. Those killed by the Japanese army alone have reached approximately 400,000. Although the British and American authorities have tried their best to cover this up, the people's anxiety and wavering sentiment is increasing daily. Coupled with general unfavorable economic and social phenomena, the people of both countries feel an increasing</p>
<p>weariness of war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increasing interference of the United States in British colonies has deepened the friction between Great Britain and the United States, and the relationship between Great Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly complex and subtle. Observing the increasingly firm unity of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and the gradual progress of the construction of Greater East Asia, Great Britain and the United States are quite worried and are eager to realize their ambitions before the foundation of this Greater East Asia construction is consolidated. Therefore, they are waging both war and propaganda. The Cairo and Tehran talks are one example of this, but this action will ultimately fail. Even the general opinions within Great Britain and the United States are greatly criticizing this. Looking at North Africa and the Italian mainland, in North Africa, Great Britain and the United States variably changed the Lavish government's vice-chairman, Daqi, to make him rebel, and used this to shake the French army. However, after it was done, they still</p>
<p>assassinated him. Furthermore, Patrie is no longer regarded as an opponent by Great Britain and the United States, only as a traitor. He has already stepped into his destined fate. Great Britain and the United States are willing to resort to any means to achieve their goals, not hesitating to trample on humanity, such as using air raids to destroy cities and kill innocent civilians, trying to make their enemy people succumb to terror and surrender. This is one example. Also, the number of Japanese hospital ships sunk by Great Britain and the United States has reached twelve. This is all due to Great Britain and the United States disregarding international law and</p>
<p>justice and humanity.</p>
<p>Such atrocities cannot be tolerated by God or man, and we must thoroughly punish them. In the United States, due to the prolonged war, the nation's anxiety about the future of the war is deepening, and Great Britain and the United States really do not know why they are fighting. This war is actually an unjust war</p>
<p>launched by Great Britain and the United States to conquer the world. Therefore, Roosevelt has no just cause for the war. He seems to have considered the name "war for survival," but because this war is not a legitimate war, it is difficult to reconcile name and reality. When Britain began its war against Germany, it claimed that this war was fought to uphold the existence of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other small countries in Eastern Europe. However, to this day, its attitude towards these small countries is ambiguous. In the past, Great Britain and the United States used the Atlantic Charter to advocate the principle of not expanding territory and the principle of national self-determination. However, to this day, Great Britain and the United States have disregarded the rights of the small countries in Europe and attempted to expand their territory, completely contradicting their initial claims. Great Britain and the United States</p>
<p>at the beginning of the war</p>
<p>had eagerly tried to conceal their ambitions for a long time, but their ambitions were finally exposed. At the Cairo Conference, Great Britain and the United States expressed their intention to seize Japanese territory, reduce Japan to a third-rate country, and enslave the Aryan nations. I still remember that thirty years ago, signs reading "Chinese and dogs not allowed" were written at the entrances of the customs clubs in Beijing and Tianjin and Shanghai parks. Great Britain and the United States are imposing such attitudes on Japan and China and trying to turn East Asia into a land of slaves. On the contrary, Japan's war aim is to prevent Great Britain and the United States from invading the countries of Greater East Asia, ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and further maintain world peace. In other words, it is to liberate the nations of Greater East Asia from the shackles of Great Britain and the United States and jointly build a just world. Therefore, the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia have unanimously risen up, determined to complete the war together with Japan and strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. The previous Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are expressions of this spirit. The Greater East Asia Declaration and the great charter for the construction of Greater East Asia are rebuilding the pyramid of the world. Our Greater East Asian nations, in order to realize this</p>
<p>great declaration,</p>
<p>must strive to win this war. Your participation in the Greater East Asia Youth Corps general mobilization movement, working hand in hand with China and Manchuria towards the goals of the war, and aiming to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, can be said to be a noble mission. I hope that you will work harder to achieve this great mission.</p>
<h3>German Forces on Eastern Front Attack in Three Routes in the South, Fierce Battles Also Occurring in Central Area</h3>
<p>Switzerland and Keijo (Seoul), 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Last night, the Moscow Information Bureau's final announcement acknowledged that German forces were attacking along three routes on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>It revealed that yesterday, in the Chiroping southwestern area within the Kirovograd southern Korsten district, German forces attacked with infantry and tanks, and the Red Army fought hard to respond. Last night, a British correspondent reported from Moscow, with content similar to Soviet intelligence, saying that between Kirovograd and Krivoy Rog, German forces were attempting to wedge-shaped troops to defend the Red Army's defensive lines. The intense attack from the southeast of Kirovograd, in the bend of the Dnieper River, with German forces diverting large numbers of tanks and infantry from other areas to reinforce. It also claimed that on the southern end of the Belarusian line, German forces</p>
<p>advanced west of Chiroping to increase their counter-offensive pressure. By the German military's targeting of attacks in the more southern areas, it appears that their plan is to force the Red Army, distributed along the entire front line, to retreat towards the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The naval reporter Torus stated: For weeks, there have been no practical changes in the southern war situation on the Eastern Front, other than the increased pressure from the German forces. In the central part of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces have dispatched reinforcements to the Navol Vitebsk area to assist in the battle, and the Soviet offensive has entered a new stage. From the end of October to the middle of December, the situation there was quiet. After careful preparation, a large-scale offensive is now underway. This offensive, using elite troops, may be a prelude to the Soviet's winter offensive. There is little doubt that the Soviet forces will attack in that area. Currently, the Soviet pressure is concentrated on the Vitebsk area. The Soviet forces are launching a frontal attack on the German positions from the east and are conducting a flanking maneuver from the north, and fierce battles are currently underway. The Soviet forces deeply penetrated the German positions with superior forces the day before yesterday. The German counteroffensive recaptured part of the lost territory. The Soviet forces failed to break through the German defenses. The total army on the Eastern Front has been quite successful. German forces attacked between</p>
<p>Kirov and Raichisa, destroying a Soviet division, and a gap in the German lines has been filled. In the Tito-Khei area, the German vanguard has made some progress, but the fierce Soviet counterattack has been repelled. German forces in the Dnieper River bend are attacking southeast of Kirovograd and have made some progress. The war situation in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River is unchanged. The Soviet offensive against the German bridgehead in Nikopol has not yet succeeded. The situation in Korsun is quiet, but the Soviet elite forces are concentrated there, and they are likely to cross the river on the ice.</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 22nd that Soviet forces had completely occupied the Kherson bridgehead.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Launch Large-Scale Attack on Kunming Airfield, Destroying 40 Chongqing Planes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd that the Imperial Army Air Force, with a combined formation of fighter-bombers, launched a fierce surprise attack on the Kunming Airfield on the afternoon of December 22, sweeping away the stubborn obstruction of about 40 Chongqing fighters. Bombing Chongqing planes on the ground resulted in the following confirmed results: 26 fighters shot down (8 unconfirmed), 6 large planes destroyed, and 8 small planes destroyed, totaling 40 planes. Four of our planes were self-destroyed or did not return to base.</p>
<p>A certain base on the China front, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Japanese Army Air Corps, they attacked Kunming, Yunnan, the Chongqing military base, on the 18th and 19th, and then launched a third strong attack on the Kunming airfield, the largest stronghold in the southwestern region of Chongqing, on the afternoon of the 22nd. It seemed that the Chongqing side had already detected the Japanese planes' attack, so when the planes arrived over Kunming that day, about 40 fighters, such as Chongqing's P49, P150, and P38 types, were already engaged in combat. The Japanese planes immediately engaged them in aerial combat. As a result, 26 of them were shot down, and the Chongqing planes parked on the ground were fiercely bombed, including six large ones and eight small ones, which were set on fire. In this battle, a total of 40 enemy planes were shot down and destroyed. The American air force stationed in Chongqing had previously incorporated the Chongqing air force into its own, so about half of those shot down this time were old-fashioned planes of the Chongqing air force. According to reports, Chongqing has about 300 to 400 aircraft on the front line, but 84 were lost in the Changde campaign. When Japanese planes attacked Kunming, Yunnan, on the 18th and 19th, another 32 were shot down and destroyed by Japanese planes. Now another 40 have been destroyed by Japanese planes. Therefore, in the short period since the beginning of November, Chongqing has lost most of its front-line aircraft. Furthermore, in the battle on the 22nd, the Chongqing side had fighters in the air on alert 20 minutes before the Japanese planes arrived over Kunming, waiting to intercept the Japanese planes, but the Japanese planes finally broke through their alert line and dared to launch a strong attack, achieving great results, which proves the superiority of the Japanese planes' combat spirit and combat technology.</p>
<h3>War Results of Japanese Army in Hunan-Hubei Operations</h3>
<p>Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Central China front, the Japanese army has captured a large amount of war booty in the Hunan-Hubei operations. It is said that in the battle to capture Changde, 10,000 several thousand people, including the commander of Chongqing's 57th Division, were annihilated. In this battle, countless mountain artillery pieces, mortars, and light and heavy machine guns were captured. In addition, in an attack south of Changde, the Japanese army crushed the Chongqing army's 3rd Far Expeditionary Army, which was reinforcing Changde, and again captured a large amount of war booty. A portion of this, totaling dozens of ships, arrived in a certain place on the 21st. After being unloaded, it piled up like a mountain, causing the local residents to be stunned, which proves the greatness of the war results obtained by the Japanese army this time.</p>
<h3>Power of Japanese Army on Yuan River Front</h3>
<p>Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base on the Central China front, the activities of the Japanese Army Air Force were extremely significant in this operation. All fronts were under the Japanese air superiority. When the battle to capture the Yuan River defense line gradually intensified, the US Air Force cooperated with the Chongqing army and gradually entered the Japanese medical preparation network, launching guerrilla-style activities. However, after the Japanese planes repeatedly bombed their bases and launched air battles over the battlefield, the US Air Force was frightened, so the Japanese army units were invincible with the cooperation of the Japanese Air Force. Currently, the enemy army is extremely afraid of the Japanese army's attacks. When Japanese planes appear over the battlefield, enemy planes immediately flee at the sight of them. In particular, the battle to capture the Yuan River Fortress Line and the annihilation battle near Changde for the first time demonstrated the power of the integration of land and air forces. Later, on the western front, the airborne troops cooperated to suppress the enemy forces surrounded by the Japanese army in the Basha Mountain range, bombing and defeating them.</p>
<h3>Youth Corps Launches Anti-Drug Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - This time, the students of universities and middle schools in the capital, in light of the fact that some unrepentant people in the country are still indulging in sensual pleasures and drug dens under this total war system, spurred by a sense of justice, have automatically launched an anti-drug movement, carrying out righteous appeals with disciplined actions. Since the launch of this movement, it has won the unanimous sympathy of all sectors of the public. At the same time, students from all over the country have also risen up in response, launching anti-smoking, gambling, and dancing propaganda, with an exciting and enthusiastic atmosphere. The General Headquarters of the China Youth Corps and the local provincial and municipal corps headquarters believe that this student-initiated persuasion movement is very meaningful and are actively guiding it, ensuring that this movement unfolds concrete anti-drug work in compliance with government laws and regulations and in obedience to group discipline.</p>

<h3>Price Assessment Council Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday, All Industries Must Sell at Originally Set Price Limits</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The Shanghai Special Municipal Government recently found that commodity prices in the city were soaring. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the retail prices of various businesses and shops had long been legally restricted. Unexpectedly, recently, the general merchants and people have disobeyed the law and secretly raised the price limits without authorization. If this situation is not promptly curbed, it will have a significant impact on people's livelihoods and public security. To suppress and stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government specially ordered the Shanghai Special Municipal Price Assessment Committee to convene a temporary emergency committee meeting in the Municipal Economic Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 23rd) to discuss overall countermeasures to suppress and stabilize prices. The members attending the meeting included Municipal Government Representative Pan Da, First Police Bureau Deputy Director Su Chengde (represented by Section Chief Zhang), First District Economic Section Chief Feng You, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Business Unification Association Representative Yu Langxi, Municipal Food Bureau Director Ji Hua (represented by Section Chief Wang), Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Mai Jingming, and Central Market Director Tao Wenzhai. The meeting was chaired by the Municipal Economic Bureau Director Xu Tianshen, who reported on the recent rise in prices. Various committee representatives exchanged discussions on countermeasures to suppress and stabilize prices. The result was a decision to emphasize enforcement action in this effort to suppress and stabilize prices. The retail prices of various businesses and shops must comply with the originally set price limits. If there are any violations of the law or exceed the price limits, they will be severely punished once discovered. At the same time, it was decided to continue to convene a small group meeting this afternoon (the 24th) to discuss and study detailed rules for suppressing and stabilizing prices. As soon as the steps are determined, strict measures to suppress and stabilize prices will be implemented. It is reported that the small group meeting designated the Business Unification Association, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and representatives from the Central Market to be responsible for holding it.</p>
<h3>Winter Vacation Approaches, Fundraising for Scholarships, Sixth Session Begins Preparation, Hoping Readers Will Donate and Give Guidance</h3>
<p>Ms. Gu Ying Suggests a Christmas Charity Dance</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship has been held for five sessions, and thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of old friends, many impoverished students have been able to continue their studies. The staff of this newspaper are deeply pleased to be able to participate in this meaningful work. Now that winter vacation is approaching again, preparations for the sixth scholarship session will begin immediately. The staff are very willing to continue their efforts to enhance this communication work, deeply hoping that readers will continue to display the highest compassion and donate generously. However, as prices are currently rising, the expenses for this session will be even greater than the previous session. The staff hopes that all old students who received assistance in the previous session will continue to receive assistance and that new students will be added. Therefore, the burden on readers will inevitably increase, and expectations of readers' enthusiasm are even more profound. At the beginning of this preparation and launch, we happened to receive a letter from Ms. Gu Ying, advocating a "Christmas Charity Dance to Help Scholarships." Ms. Gu Ying is now a Shen Bao reader, but in the past, she was a student who received a scholarship. It is commendable to remember the source of the water. There are no boundaries to professions, but sobriety in drunkenness is most valued. We hope that the dancers will respond enthusiastically and promote this extremely meaningful work. The following is a transcript of Ms. Gu Ying's letter: "I am a dancer who is looked down upon by society. I am forced by life to support a family of eight, so I use my waist and feet to earn a living. I used to be a student who received a scholarship and worked as a Girl Scout. Time flies, and another Christmas season has arrived. I want to launch an individual "Christmas Charity Dance." I will hold a tea dance at the Great Eastern Dance Hall from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Christmas Eve. Half of the dance money earned during the day and night will be used for the Shen Bao Scholarship. I want to throw a brick to attract jade, hoping that all the red sisters in the dance world will sympathize with me and participate in this extremely meaningful and valuable event. Please do your best to help me, so that my small good intentions can create a big good deed. Respectfully, Gu Ying, a dancer."</p>

<h3>Guangtian, Head of Intelligence, Analyzes European and American Situation, Dissects Base Thoughts of Britain and America</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Regarding South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts' speech on "New Europe Theory" delivered at the British branch of the British Empire Parliamentary Association, advocating that a trinity of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union be formed after the war, Guangtian, head of the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy's intelligence department, gave a speech at the regular press conference yesterday (23rd) afternoon at 3 p.m., analyzing the European and American situation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Base Thoughts of Britain and America</p>
<p>Head Guangtian first said: Regarding the content of Smuts' New Europe Theory, it is enough to see the base thoughts of Britain and America. Guangtian then analyzed Smuts' New Europe Theory, stating that after the anti-Axis powers defeat the Axis, the world's sphere of influence can be divided into communism centered on the Soviet Union and capitalism centered on Britain and America. Thus, the world situation will be based on these two ideologies as the scope, and righteous countries will disappear, and there will be no independent countries. This idea is not only present in Britain alone, but also in many anti-Axis countries around the world. American Walter Lippmann has also made similar remarks, and US Vice President Wallace also has the same idea, saying that after the end of World War II, a third world war will inevitably occur, its target being the conflict arising from friction between communism centered on the Soviet Union and capitalism centered on Britain and America. Observing Vice President Wallace's remarks, there is no democracy, and the existence of small countries is denied. Smuts' New Europe Theory states that after World War II, the situation will be the same, with no intention of recognizing the existence of small countries, and no intention of hoping for the independence of any country. This is what Britain and America seek. Therefore, everyone should pay special attention to the trinity claim made by Smuts in his New Europe Theory, namely Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. From the perspective of the world war situation, if Britain loses in World War II, it will be completely destroyed. Even if it wins, it will be absorbed by the United States. Thus is Britain's fate. According to Smuts, who is British, the crux of Britain is specifically emphasized in the essay. The so-called trinity of nations means that after this world war, Britain will not be able to exist. Even if it is possible to establish, it will be a binary, the existence of the United States and the Soviet Union. Guangtian then made a detailed analysis of the existence and trends of the United States after the war.</p>
<p>American Economic Exploitation</p>
<p>Regarding the post-war trends of the United States, we can observe specific facts. The change that occurred in Bolivia, South America, on the 20th of this month is enough to prove the situation in the United States. The Bolivian National Military and progressive elements expressed dissatisfaction with the government and used force to overthrow the government and establish a new government. According to the published platform, in order to awaken the attention of the world's people, Bolivia's domestic resources should be expanded, and Bolivia's people's livelihood should be enriched and utilized. Therefore, what we should pay special attention to is that according to Bolivia's domestic economic strength, the platform published in Bolivia has already declared its determination to eliminate American economic exploitation. Originally, the current industries are tin, copper, and tungsten minerals, and the country is based on mineral production. However, Bolivia's mineral production has always been developed by American capital, especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the United States lost the Malayan tin market and could only rely on Bolivia's tin mines, American economic exploitation became even more severe. The second point to note is that the policy announced by the new Bolivian government declared that its foreign policy had not changed, especially its relationship with the United States. In this situation, there is no lack of contradiction. An examination of the relationship between the United States and South America shows that the United States has always held a hegemonic advantage in political and economic terms, and boasted that South America and other countries cannot separate from the United States or oppose the United States. However, in reality, South American countries do not want to be exploited and oppressed by the United States. Anti-American sentiment is quite prevalent among the people of South America, and they often attempt to break away from the United States and seek independence. The intensity of this ideological movement has recently begun to unfold.</p>
<p>Intense Anti-American Sentiment</p>
<p>Then, examples of anti-American facts among the people of South America were given as follows: During the summer of this year, US Vice President Wallace traveled to South America and encountered many unexpected instances of dissatisfaction while giving speeches in various public relations events. At that time, South American people shouted slogans such as "Down with Dollar Diplomacy," and Wallace had no choice but to return unhappily. Thus, the anti-American sentiment of the South American people can be seen to be increasingly intense. The South American countries known for being anti-American are Argentina first, followed by Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Chile. Argentina has maintained neutrality until now. Secondly, although on the surface it is involved in the anti-Axis side, its anti-American sentiment is quite intense. The other South American countries are largely the same. Currently, the war situation is protracted, so American economic exploitation of South America is becoming increasingly severe, and American aid to South America is gradually shrinking. Therefore, the desire of South American countries to break away from the United States is increasing day by day. This is what I can assert. This kind of fact is not only prevalent in Central and South American countries, but anti-imperialism is also intense in countries such as Iraq and India. Therefore, Smuts' New Europe Theory, which advocates reducing small countries, and the American dream of controlling the world will be opposed by countries around the world and will ultimately fail. This fact is something we can observe. In addition, the United States' contempt for the countries of Greater East Asia and the desire of Britain and America to control Greater East Asia will be shattered by Japan's use of force, until their dreams fail.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>After the New Price Limit on Coal Balls</h3>
<p>Recently, prices of all goods in this city have been soaring, with the situation for fuel being the most serious, causing residents throughout the city to feel that the future is bleak. Now, the economic authorities in this city have adjusted the price limit for coal balls, with the price delivered to users being 1,260 national currency per ton. All coal ball compositions must use a coal seam of 50% as the standard. In this way, coal balls will now have an officially set price and quality standard. However, historical facts tell us that setting an official price is one thing, whether or not it is difficult to purchase is another, and whether or not the quality meets the standard is another. Due to the second and third points, especially the second point, problems arise, making the price limit equivalent to a mere formality, and the black market becomes rampant as a result. Since the black market has become the only source of daily fuel, there is even more hoarding behavior of having materials but not producing, having goods but not selling, so it is no wonder that the result is so dire.</p>
<p>What we hope for after the new price limit on coal balls is: In terms of implementing rationing, all coal ball merchants throughout the city must be ordered to only sell at the new price limit and are not allowed to engage in any illegal transactions at the same time. In that case, coal ball prices can naturally be included in the scope of the official price. In terms of unblocking sources, it is necessary to actively engage in increasing the production of coal mines in various regions at the same time, such as the Mantou Mountain Coal Mine Company recently mentioned by the Ministry of Industry when receiving Chinese and foreign reporters. After January of next year, 100 to 150 tons of coal can be produced daily. The Anhui Lieshan Coal Mine Company and the Xinjiang Changxing Coal Mine Company have rich reserves and have now prepared development plans to prepare for implementation. This is the basic work to solve the fuel panic.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Control of Hemp, Formulate Movement Measures</h3>
<p>The government considers hemp and its products to be important materials that are closely related to military needs and people's livelihood. In order to strengthen control, it has established a Joint Association of the Hemp Industry and, in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement, it has formulated temporary measures to prohibit the movement of hemp and hemp products in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>118 New Banks in Five Years</h3>
<p>The financial industry in Shanghai has been abnormally prosperous in recent years, with new financial institutions springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. In order to stabilize finance and prevent illegal merchants from disrupting finance, the National Government's Ministry of Finance recently announced measures to implement management. Since then, the organizations of financial institutions in this city have become increasingly sound. According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai Special City Banking Association currently has a total of 170 member banks, including 52 commercial savings banks, 34 banks self-established by various industries, and 84 ordinary banks that accept deposits and make loans. From before the incident to 1938, there were 52 old banks, and 118 new ones have been established in the past five years.</p>
<h3>Business Certificates in the Eighth District, Apply for Processing</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the Eighth District Public Office has been implementing registration of various industries and commerce and issuing business certificates since January 1, 1944. At the same time, the classification business license method stipulated by the former French Concession Public Works Bureau was abolished. It is now known that the application form is issued separately by the Economic Office, which sends staff to each household to verify the number. After receiving the application form, the applicant must fill it out clearly within the specified date (the deadline is printed on the application form), and bring the old certificate to the Economic Office of the Eighth District Public Office at No. 80 Madang Road to cancel the old certificate and process the application, so as to avoid crowding.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fluff Industry Association, Discussing Raw Material Issues</h3>
<p>There are approximately 350 cotton fluff businesses in the city. The new price limit has been approved by the Economic Office of the First District Public Office and has been implemented since the 15th of this month. Yesterday it was learned that the raw materials required by the industry every day cannot be allocated and are purchased on the black market, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. The industry association, in view of the fact that the severe winter has arrived and the citizens need goods frequently, and that if operations are suspended due to the lack of raw materials, it will inevitably cause unrest among the citizens, has decided to convene an emergency meeting of the standing directors at the club on Gekelu Road at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the bankers' association's call loan rate was 2.2 fen, an increase of 2 fen. The money supply continues to tighten.</p>
<p>Grain: Yesterday was slightly stable, probably because prices were high, and buyers have gradually declined. It is also reported that the relevant authorities will try their best to prevent excessive price increases, so sellers were more willing to sell. The price of early japonica rice all fell slightly, and oil grains also decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Rayon: Yesterday, the upward trend stopped, and the market turned negative, mainly due to the tightening money supply, and some small investors sold. The price gradually declined. The last price of 120-count rayon at Tianqiao was 69.5, a slight decrease compared to before.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: Yesterday, there was still hope for price increases, but trading was not active. The selling price of white wax was 21,000, and vaseline was 13,000. The prices of pine resin and spindle oil were similar to before, both around 40,000.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Tianfeng Real Estate Co., Ltd. recently increased its capital to 50 million Central Reserve Certificates. After the capital increase, the company immediately purchased 32 three-story garden houses near Avenyue Road on Suzhou Road. The buildings were sturdy, the style was elegant, and each house had sanitary facilities. The purchase price was quite low.</p>
<p>Limin Bank has completed its second capital increase of 7 million yuan, bringing the total capital to 10 million yuan. A temporary meeting of new and old shareholders was held at the Bankers Association yesterday to amend the articles of association and re-elect Zhang De, Chu, and others as directors, and Yang Shouzhang and others as supervisors.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Closed in the Afternoon, Chinese Stocks Hovered</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks first fell and then stabilized. At first, they were pressured by sellers seeking cash, but in reality, they were affected by the tightening money supply. By around 11:00, the selling pressure eased, and prices became more stable. The market paused for a few minutes at 11:50. A temporary meeting was held, and it was decided that because tomorrow is a holiday for money changers, the market would be closed in the afternoon to facilitate trading. The market will be closed for a total of three and a half days, including Sunday, and will reopen next Monday. Those who need to cover their short positions will also do so on Monday.

<h3>A Hospital on Luoyang Road, Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Visit</h3>
<p>Benevolence, Skill, and Good Deeds</p>
<p>The medical business is a social undertaking, with saving lives as the highest goal. Although it is not as ideal as it could be in today's society, every true doctor, nurse, and medical entrepreneur must use benevolence and skill to save the public as their most sublime ideal, and must not haggle over monetary rewards or business profits. Here, Doctor Gu mentioned a recent news story about the hospital. He said that one month ago, one night, an emergency patient named Zhang Longwen was sent in. After diagnosis by the resident chief physician, it was determined that he had TB-related enteritis, an obstruction, as well as lung disease and tuberculous peritonitis. In reality, the patient was too poor and kept delaying treatment, which caused him to fall into such a serious state. Only then did he scrape together some money and come to the hospital for treatment. Although the disease was not completely hopeless, treatment was very difficult and he would definitely need to be hospitalized. However, the patient did not have sufficient means. What about relief? Where is this kind of funding in this era? Hospitalization and treatment for this kind of disease would easily cost ten thousand or even tens of thousands of yuan! However, if he was rejected, wouldn't that be the same as rejecting his last chance of survival? Moreover, after investigation, this Mr. Zhang had a glorious history. He had fallen from the upper class to his present poverty for the sake of the nation and society! Moreover, he was only in his thirties and had a great future. From the perspective of justice and human sentiment, how could we sit idly by and watch such a person who was poor for the nation and society die without lending a hand? From the perspective of the country and society, we must give him full assistance. Therefore, the authorities of Nanyang Hospital decided to first save him from danger, regardless of his ability to pay. If the third-class ward was full, he would be sent to the second-class ward. If the second-class ward was also full, he would be sent to the first-class ward. Major and minor surgeries were performed to remove the diseased intestine and treat the other attached illnesses. After more than a month, his life was finally saved, and he could move freely. Medical, surgical, ward, and food expenses were not counted, and the cost of special drugs alone was more than ten thousand yuan! However, since the patient was indeed unable to pay, no guarantee was required, and he was allowed to return with joy, waiting to do more beneficial things for the country and society in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, helping the poor and sick is the duty of hospitals and doctors. However, due to the limited resources of private hospitals, some consideration must be given to the scope of assistance. Doctor Gu talked about their attitude towards poor patients. First, all patients who come to the hospital for treatment, regardless of their poverty or not, are treated equally in terms of diagnosis, medication, and all necessary treatment procedures. However, if the medication is too expensive, some of the cost must still be recovered.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (4)</p>
<p>Mr. Fang's story of the three brave human bombs was not about the Shanghai Incident.</p>
<p>"What I want to talk about are the three brave human bombs from 334 years ago. That is, the events of October of the third year of the Keicho era..."</p>
<p>The students' mouths, which had already been opened, were stunned and could not be closed for a moment. It was as if they thought they were going to have candy, but instead they got some dry snacks.</p>
<p>"You all know about Toyotomi Hideyoshi's expedition to Korea, right? Such a large-scale expedition to the continent was the first time before the Meiji era—130,000 troops. The magnificence of the Taiko can be imagined. This war, although said to be an expedition to Korea, was actually against the Ming Dynasty. Since ancient times, wars have always had people working behind the scenes. The current incident is also like this. What is most hateful are these things that are supporting them from behind..."</p>
<p>Although he was an English teacher, Mr. Ogata was a true local, a very generous person. However, he was an amateur when it came to debate, and the more intense his emotions, the more unsystematic his remarks became...</p>
<p>"The 130,000 Japanese troops soon swept through the eight provinces of Gyeongsang-do. In this battle, the soldiers of our Saga Domain also participated. The 17th lord of the domain, Yoshihiro, stood independently at the front and engaged in battles like a god of war. It seems the world only says that Kato Kiyomasa was the one fighting, but that's just what storytellers and opera singers have created. How brave our Nabeshima troops were is clearly recorded in the enemy's documents. If there wasn't one Ishizaki, none of the pirates could have survived, the Ming people recorded. Ishizaki was Lord Utatsu's nickname.</p>
<p>Yoshihiro trampled over the Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces and formed a base in Sacheon. The Taiko ordered the construction of a castle there to be used as an advance base. This is the so-called Sacheon Castle. The Ming Dynasty's 200,000 troops attacked there. At that time, Yoshihiro only had 5,000 loyal subordinates—one-fortieth of the strength—to resist the Ming army alone. This alone shows how incomparably brave the Saga soldiers were."</p>
<p>Local pride had already become commonplace in Saga, so the teacher who spoke and the students who listened did not find it strange.</p>
<p>"The Ming army, advancing like clouds, saw that the Shimazu line of defense was tight, and loaded gunpowder under the castle, thinking of burning the castle in one fell swoop. Gunpowder was already being used at that time. Not only that, but in the Tenbun era, wars using guns had already begun in Tanegashima.</p>
<p>As a result, our army really had no way to go. If it was a charging battle, we would still have confidence, but in front of gunpowder, swordsmanship was useless. While all the soldiers were gritting their teeth in hatred, a loud explosion suddenly came from behind the enemy camp's fortifications. For some reason, the gunpowder magazine, which the enemy relied on for their lives, caught fire. This time, it was the opposite, the enemy was being burned by the fire and was in chaos. Yoshihiro then announced the occurrence of the incident. The army, pouring out from the castle gates like a tide, killed every enemy they saw. The defeat suddenly turned into a victory!"</p>

Moral education training is emphasized on weekdays. Yesterday, Huang Haoyou was invited to talk about the virtues that young people should have, such as responsibility, courtesy, diligence, thrift, honesty, cleanliness, simplicity, perseverance, and progress, encouraging the students in this great period to not miss the opportunity to study, understand the times, contribute their intelligence, work hard and practice thrift, be determined to eradicate selfish and self-interested thoughts, overcome obstacles, and become self-reliant.</p>
<h3>New Year's Card Money, Change to Help Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>The New Year is coming soon, and everyone is busy sending New Year's cards. The children in our class were also preparing to buy New Year's cards to send to our teachers. However, after the teacher explained to us the true meaning and waste of sending New Year's cards, and said that many compatriots are suffering from not having clothes to wear because of the cold weather, we were moved. Now, we are willing to donate this 140 yuan of money for buying New Year's cards to those poor children who have no left clothes to wear, in order to do our little bit of sympathy. All students of Grade 4, Minzhi Elementary School.</p>
