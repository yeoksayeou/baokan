<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時社會問題——勉社會福利部成立</h3>
<p>社會問題，正確的說，也就是一個政治問題，社會行政應該是一國行政最主要的部門。在平時，國家政治上　道，社會安定，繁榮而進步，則「人盡其力，地盡其利」的最髙理想，就可以實現，所以現代前進各國，莫不重視社會行政，以謀社會人羣的福利。至於戰時，舉凡軍事政治經濟一切政策之推行，作戰國策之貫澈，尤賴社會秩序之安定化，人長生活之合理化，然後動員綱領可以實現，總力作戰成爲事實，最後勝利乃可期待。</p>
<p>國府參戰以來，努力於戰時體制之確立，政治，經濟，軍事諸端，積械推進，而據本月十一日南京電稱：「自　高國防會議議決設立社會福利部後，該部即按照組織法所訂，業已成立。現該部爲掌理社會福利，籌振慈善及民衆指導事宜起見，特設民衆政治指導署，公益署，振務局，社會簡易保險局，總務局，體力局，勞動司，職業司等部門，並於事務上有必要時，經行政院會識及立法會議議決，得增置裁併所屬各署局司各委員會及其他各機關」云云。可界當局對於戰時社會行政與社會福利，已加密切的注意和進行適切的處理了。除了熱烈期待該部確實擔負起戰時社會福利及民衆政治指導的責任以後，我們站在人民立塲，貢獻一點意見，並喚起社會各界的注意。</p>
<p>國府社會福利部的組織法，我們還沒有看到，不過從上引電訊中已可看到，他的主要任務：第一，是「掌理社會福利，壽振慈善」事宜，似平爲積極的解決社會問題，則其性質似乎有　於歐美國家的勞工部，因爲丁業發達的國家，最大的社會問題，就是勞工問題。不過，就我國實際的社會情形說，工業旣不發達，勞工也只佔全國人口中極小的比率，還不是社會問題中最主要的問題，自然沒有仿效歐美國家特設勞工部的必要。所以中國所謂社會行政，竹通多指消極的救濟而言。如日本戰時新設的「厚生省」，似乎和我國社會福利部的宗旨相侔。不過我國還是以農業爲主的國家，和日本之工業及金融資本發展到最髙階段的國家，其社會問題，也有根本不同的內容。日最大的社會問題：一是戰時救濟工作，這種又包括兩種不同的任務：一爲全國難民，赤貧同胞的救濟，做到少有所學，荘有所事，老有所養的地步。二爲各地隱貧同胞的救助，主要的是廣大薪水階級之救濟，自學校敎職員起，以至政府各機關團體的中下級公務員止。目前正當薪水所入，多有　於不足維持最低生活的困難境地，必須進行有計劃而普遍和切實的救濟。第二，是優待軍警及其家屬，優待與作戰有關的農，工，交通，文化名部門的勞作者，等等，規定適當的方策，而普遍切實的付諸實施。第三，確定合理的土地政策和農民問題對策，尤其是對自耕農和佃農的保護，土地嚝置，不事耕作之懲處，和游資土地投機及土地兼併之限制等，都與增進戰時生產，推進和平建設有重大關係，自應早爲注意。第四，規定戰時工業與勞資問題的條文，一方面獎勵有關戰時必須的產業，一方面限制戰時過分暴利，改善勞工待遇。此外，如戰時社會保險的舉辦，合作運動的推進，人才登記與職業介紹之實施，社會服務人事指導之提倡，育嬰堂，托兒所，養老院，殘廢院，公立國立平價藥房與醫院之普遍設立等，都應該是今日掌管社會福利事業者所急須着手推行的。</p>
<p>據上引電訊，又知新成立的社會福利部，除了社會福利籌振慈善事宜之外，還掌理「民衆政治指導事」，所以還特設「民衆政治指導署」，社會兼理人民組織訓練事宜，本有不少先例，特別在戰時，這種「民衆政治指導」，自然更是協力推進政府動員全國人力最重要的工作。即從社會行政本身而言，下列各項工作，也是必須努力策進的：首先是民衆政治指導與組訓綱領之確定及實施，切實爲人民解決各種困難與糾紛，指導戰時國民生活的正軌。其次是人口政策的樹立，調整人口分佈，勞工與農民分佈，例如都市人口的疏散，難民流亡者之移植墾荒，工礦生產勞動力之有計劃的分配與調整等，也可加强，「總力參戰」，而且爲戰後和平建設所不能不先事準備的工作。其三，是提倡戰時國民生活，轉移社會風氣，特別是協助有關機關，合力肅淸投機事業，烟賭娼妓，剷除土豪劣紳的惡勢力，消滅大都市的奢侈淫靡之風，振奮中國民族固有的禮，義，廉，恥，勤，儉，樸，忠等美德。以上瑣瑣諸事，似乎正是社會福利部「指導民衆政治」最應先辦的事業。</p>
<p>最後，我們不能不鄭重指出，有如我們一向所主張，社會問題的解決，決不能單靠一些原則，一些法令，最主要的是要靠社會人士來辦，要從民間推舉出適當的人物來辦，而政府則站在指導和監瞥的地位。因此，社會行政的機構，和人事本身，就不必過於繁複，而民間的地方的社會事業，公益社團，也應該由政府給予最大的扶助，務使社會各界共同來協力討論和解決社會問題。更不能忽視的是，社會問題的產生，最主要的是在戰時，投機之存在，暴利不禁，更將劃分貧富的鴻溝，增加社會的不安。故社會行政之要旨，首在使戰時福利平分，老幼有託，養生送死無憾：進而使人盡其才，地盡其利，然後政府的社會行政，可吿成功。願社會福利部與社會各界共勉之</p>
<h3>蕭叔宣接見記者　談軍事會議經過　提案百六十餘件均通過　由軍委會逐一付之實行</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　第二次全國車事會議、自十五日在京隆重揭幕後、業於十七日圓滿閉幕、會後軍委會蕭代總參謀長叔宣、特於十八日下午四時在宣傳部接見中外記者、報吿此次會議經過、據談、「此次會議目的、在使各地將領深切瞭解國府與友邦協力大東亞戰爭、向英美正式宣戰之意義、會議共計三天、委昌長始終親自出席主持、並一再剴切訓示、各出席將領對委員長之勞苦卓絕、至爲感奮、全部提案、共計一百六十餘件、均有關於確立後方治安、及擴大警備區域、暨敎育訓練服裝給養等等、均經縝密討論、全部通過、將由軍委會逐一付之實行、會議中並承寺岡顧問岩崎報道部長等講演時事戰局、及河邊總參謀長重光大使等招宴懇談、各出席將領得與友邦各長官交換意見、倍覺興奮、故大會空氣、始終融洽、而吿圓滿結束、收獲殊多」云云、</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　此次全國軍事會議現已圓滿閉幕、各地將領、雲集首都、尙朱返防、昨日（十八）下午七時、由簫代參謀總長叔宣、及黃秘書長自强、葉訓練總監蓬三氏、特聯合歡娑各地、來京出席將領、計到有齊燮元氏等多人、九時餘始興盡而散、</p>
<p>二次全軍會議席上　總參謀長之報告詞</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　第二次全國軍事會議席上軍委會總參謀長報吿詞、探錄如下「自前歲第一次軍事事會議、以迄現在、大東亞情勢旣有了很大變動與進展、我國軍事亦經過若干改革、爲檢討過去、策動將來、提出報吿關於中央軍事機構之調整、將校之集訓、部隊之編練、後方治安之維持數項、要點如左、</p>
<p>（一）中央軍事機構改組之意義及改組後之情形本會爲强化委員長之統率權起見、於去年十月特將中央軍事機構加以調整、將參謀本部、軍事訓練部、政事訓練部、及軍政部各部之職掌、合併爲陸軍部、除人事與統率有關由軍委會直接掌管、經理仍按軍需獨立本旨、歸經理總監署掌理外、餘悉納入陸軍部內、使軍令軍政軍訓及政訓、成爲一元化、又應現實之需要、增設編練總監公署、擔任國軍之整編訓練工作、於國軍之整頓改善、負有重大責任、並爲實現幕僚制度、特設總參謀長、輔佐委員長襄理一切、兼負調整指導各部署之貢、以謀軍務處理之圓滑、及建軍效率之增進、施行以來、尙稱順利、惟政訓機構不甚完備、以後當思有所改革、關於海軍、歷經友邦之援助、漸次充實、海軍基地亦有增設、敎育訓練、尤不斷努力、頗有進步、空軍經友邦之援助、機數有所增加、敎育訓練仍舊進行、內部亦在調整中、</p>
<p>（二）敎育訓練狀况，關於軍官學生之敎育、自去歲由中央陸軍軍官學校、實行分科敎育後、循序進行、敎育第一期學生、即將畢業、又前由軍事敎導團、改爲初級軍官敎導大隊、在軍校同一系統敎育之下、已於最近畢業分配於部隊任用、國軍初級等部漸巳刷新、此外爲劃一各部隊敎育統一精神思想起見、由中央陸軍將校訓練團、抽調各部隊官長、分期來京受訓、已畢業四期、尤以第四期學員、正在參戰期中、入團精神、愈加煥發、較前三期、更有進步、各部官長、平時散處各地、未易晤面、藉此機會同聚一堂、彼此感情意志、旣可融通、復與巾央各部署長官接近、時聆訓言、尤以親承委員長偉大人格之感召、於精誠團結思想規正、獲得莫大效果、歸隊以後、各部隊間連繫愈覺親密，確信於平戰兩時能爲有效之助力、與團結之精進、今後更進而增設高等軍與硏究班、以補參謀官敎育之不足、與將校集訓、同時進行、以圖國軍幹部敎育之强化、軍隊素質之提高、</p>
<p>（三）各部隊整編情形關於各部隊整編一節、各部隊長官、均出於自動整編之精神、非上級長官强令執行、至實行整編後、對於官兵處置、亦極合理、所以並無怨言、以編練進行上、頗爲圓滿、最近警衛師及獨立第十四旅併編爲警衛第二師、業經編練完成、屬有之師長及旅長、均能深悉過去軍隊擁有私兵觀念之錯誤、故十分願意遵行，深堪嘉許、</p>
<p>（四）參戰後關於後方治安維持意義之重要本總參謀長在就任之始、適値參戰宣佈之時、於訪問友軍髙級長官之際、均表示希望我國訓練國軍、以確保後方治安、蓋我軍若能確實做到後方治安之確保、與警備區域之擴大、則友軍可轉用其兵力於前綫、而我方亦可因此而擴大和平區域、以促渝方之覺悟、使全國人民、更加一層之認識、友邦無領土野心、及不侵害主權之事實證明、是友邦所期待於我國軍者、槪可瞭然、故今後關於國軍整編事宜以邁進的合理的逐次進行、以增强國軍實力、俾對於地方防衛、及作戰上、能與友軍作同盟一體之活動、以達成確保治安之任務、</p>

<h3>重慶銀錢業的風波</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>歷來重慶銀錢業風潮的發生，均由於資金短少，與投機失敗，乃至牽連同業。例如民國十七年因半元劣幣而引起的倒閉風潮，民國十九年的風潮，民二十一年的「湯字號」風潮，均與商業投機有關，那怕是做貨幣交換的投機，與做申匯的投機。去年江寗錢莊的波折的發生，據熟習重慶金融市塲者談，其經過如下：比期，重慶銀錢業頭寸不敷的達十餘家，嗣經渝中央銀行票據交換課數次提不，尙餘八家，再經軋算，結果只有江慶錢莊，集議再四，終以無法塡補，而暫吿停業，並由重慶錢業公會派員檢查該錢莊帳目。查明該錢莊在重慶方面外債共達二百八十餘萬元，內江分莊外債亦在五十萬元以上。嗣後在查其資產科目內，有一百六十餘萬元，用途不明。「財部」爲保障存戶與安定金融計，一面囑錢業公會封存該錢莊對外書鑑，一面電重慶市社會局，令該錢莊停業十五日，以資整理。</p>
<p>根據上述事實，這次銀錢業的風波，値得注意的有二點，第一，因銀根吃緊而感頭寸不敷的，顯然不僅江慶錢莊一家，雖則這種現象還不是一般的現象，但爲數達十餘家錢莊之多，在重慶市說來，佔四分之一，可說不是少數；第二，江慶錢莊宣吿淸理，是否因經理揮霍豪賭，負債日深所致？這到現在還是一個謎，同時，外間由揣測而來的傳說，也不一樣，或云投機失敗，或云資金呆滯，或云部份資金外移，一時無法調劑。這許多不同的傳說，當事者旣未宣佈，我以爲都是可能的，按江慶錢莊的股東，十之七八是內江的糖商。現在四川利率最高的地方，當首推內江與自流井兩地，比期利率上升到月息八分，已不是今天的事，數月前，即在八分的左右擺動。初秋穀黄，鄕間囤穀之風又起，同時，糖價上升，更刺激起一般糖商囤積投機的慾望，因此，有人說資金外移，呆滯，都不是沒有根據的。自然，經理的小善於經營，乃至以錢莊的資金作爲賭注等原因，我們也無從否認，不過，似難認爲此次風波的決定因素。總之，不管江慶錢莊風波的肇因在什麼地方，該錢莊以存戶的款項，移作不正當的用途，（無論是賭博也好，投機囤積也好。）這是一般人對此次風波認識的一個共同點，同時，三百幾十萬元的債務，不能一時償淸，致使若干同業，受到影饗，這也是不可否認的事實。我們固然不能根據這兩點就誇大說，重慶金融市塲或將以江慶錢莊爲起點逐漸釀成更大的風潮，不過，我們說他是重慶市銀錢業破綻暴露之開始，實無絲毫過分之處，究竟這一個破綻將　變到何種程度？將採取什麽形式收塲或發展？這都是難以預言的。我們可以說好，也可以說壞，總之，無論好與壞，均得看把握金融管制之樞紐如何而定，這是可以斷言。重慶市銀錢業基礎之薄弱，凡稍知重慶金融市塲之底蘊的，咸有同感，今我僅就錢莊略爲申論。</p>
<p>重慶錢莊產半的形式，不外下列三種：一種是先集資創設錢莊，利用錢莊來吸收外資，或通融同業間的資金，作爲經營附業的張本；一種是先由幾個不同的公司行號作基礎，大家在一共同目標——充裕本身行業資金下，集股組織者；一種是同一行業（如棉紗商，如布頭商，如紙商……等）的字號，爲使本行業的資金活動，經此集資而組緘者。前一種興後一種形式，在戰前比較流行，第二種形式在戰時流行最廣，間或也有利用第一種形式作爲吸收外資的。不管產生的形式採取那一種，一般錢莊組織的目的，均不在調劑金融，解決銀行所未解決的問題，而在利用錢莊作爲經營附業的樞紐。有人說，附業是錢莊經營者的機器，錢莊即爲這一部機器的潤滑油，如果有錢莊存在的活，那末這一部機器經過潤滑油的塗抹，就能生產更多的東西，而資本的流轉也就更多，這種譬喻，我覺得用來形容錢莊與其附業的關係，是最洽當的了。</p>
<p>一般錢莊，多以短期存放爲其業務中心，正因爲是短期存放的關係，作錢莊經營的人，他就不能以之經營比較長期性的附業（如工鑛業）十之七八都投向商業，特是帶有投機性的。因之錢莊的基礎，大都建立在商業經營上，在戰時，以帶有投機性的商業作爲投資的主要對象，比較平時更爲普遍，我們一考近年重慶錢莊發展的過程，就知道促進錢莊突然興起的原因在甚麽地方。</p>
<p>根據康永仁的統計，重慶五十三家錢莊中，於二十九半與三十年創設的要佔三十七家，其中又以三十年開始創設的爲最多，（三十年創設的佔二十四家）。何以這兩年重慶錢莊如是其發展！徴諸當時情形，戰時暴利的刺激，或爲突然興起的原因。（略）因爲數年來物價奇異的繼續上升，給了攫取戰時暴利者以最好機會，所以，是時社會上作投機事業的，比比皆是。隨着投機事業而興起的，就是銀錢業。我曾在上面提到過，錢莊是以投機事業作基礎的，這兩年投機事業發達，錢莊由是增多，這可以說是經濟現象畸形發展之必然歸趨。第二，比期利息與糧食價格的增高，使游資咸向都市集中，這也是使錢莊突然興起的一個原因。比期利息，從二十九年起，一直是向上增長着，小稍同跌。二十九年比期利息的平均數，不過八元五角四分，到三十年十月的下半月，比期利息即增高到十二元，十一月上半月爲十四元，十一月下半月爲十五元，十二月的上下期各爲十七元。這種繼漲增高的趨勢，直到政府限定比期利率，才稍稍穩定，正因爲比期利息增高，游資更顯得活躍。游資的來源，大都出自下面三途：一是內移的資金，一是半官性質的臨時費，一時地全的存款。內中當以地主資金與內移資金是構成新興錢莊資本的主要因素。他們第一步是投放比期，第二步是合夥經營投機事業，第三步則組織錢莊或銀號。近年來，據熟習商情者談，鄉村地主挾資到城市做投機事業或錢荘的，賓在不少數。因第一個地主只要售二百石穀，即可單獨經營一家錢莊，與穀價低落時比較，未可同日而語。第三，銀行以錢莊爲尾閭及政府對錢莊的限制不嚴，也是錢莊蔚然興起的原因。當然，最主要的原因，還是戰時暴利的刺激，與游資的作祟。</p>
<p>錢莊旣然是以帶投機性的商業爲其基礎，那末，可能發生的現象，將有以下二種：第一是因資金呆滯而引起風波。像這樣的錢莊，他作業的主要對象，決不在調劑金融，而在吸收存款，用來經營自己的附業。茲以二十九年與三十年重慶錢莊比期存放的情形作例，二十九年六月底，重慶市三十九家錢莊的比期存款總額是一九·七〇四·〇〇〇元，放款是一九·〇一六·〇〇〇元，九月底的存款總額是二五，七九〇·〇〇〇元，放款是二四·五一六·〇〇〇元，十二月底的存款總額是三六·九二一·〇〇〇元，放軟總額是三六·八六三·〇〇〇元，三十年的一月底存款總額是四四，三二八·〇〇〇元，放款是三八，八七七·〇〇〇元，三月底的存款總額是六一·一七〇·〇〇〇元，放款是五八·三三三·〇〇〇元。再以放款之類別來說，重慶二十四家錢莊銀號於是時投放總額爲三五·〇六五·三一九·一四元，內中商業放款佔總數百分之九八，八八，實數爲三四·六七五·八八七·三七元，至於對工礦業的放款，僅佔全部放款額的百分之〇·〇一，實數爲一六五·〇〇〇元。兩相比較，工礦業也就顯得可憐透了。假使，再以投資的類別看，投資總額爲三·三九四·〇七七·六〇元，商業投資即佔百分之四二·一九八實數爲一·四三二·〇六一，九七元，工礦事業投資僅佔百分之一·四〇，實數爲五〇·〇〇〇元，二十四家錢莊以五萬元投資工礦業，足見其權衡投放之輕重爲何如耳。所謂投放，在事實上並不是在錢莊經營之附業以外去投放，而是以自身經營之附業爲主，然後才以其餘額推及其他，這可以說是公開的秘密。由此，我們可以得到這樣一個結論：一般錢莊吸收存款的目的，不是在調劑市塲金融，而是在充裕自己所經營之附業，此其一，構成經營附業的資本，因活期或短比存款限制的原故，同時，再因戰時暴利的刺激，所經營的附業，大都走上投機一途，此其二：經營者旣是以一部份存軟投在自己經營的事業上，一部份作爲信用放款，投放在其他公司行號上，但，這些都有可能使資金滯呆，那怕是投機事業或短比放款，此其三。資　滯呆本爲經營商業者　爲詬病的。當銀風鬆弛，存款來源豐裕的時候，資金呆滯，尙不覺其可應，如果銀風轉堅，存款稀少，同時又在錢莊準備金額不如何充裕的時候，由資金呆滯可能引起的波動，凡從事錢莊經營的人，立時就能感覺到它的威脅，而且這種威脅，也可能發展成爲金融風潮的開端。假使江慶錢莊是因資令滯呆而引起今天的後果的話，那末，就可以把歸入到道一類。第二是由於投機失敗而引起的市塲波折。本來，事業成爲一種投機的行爲，在他的本身就帶有若干冒險性，例如三十年底與三十一年上季，許多在香港，緬甸，金華等地做進口貨業的人，他們確實獲到了令人驚異的暴利，但因戰爭的風險而遭失敗者，亦大有人在。當臘戍和金華渝陷的時候，不是曾聽到這樣的話：某銀行損失了若干萬元，某公司損失了若干萬元嗎？如此巨額損失，假使爲錢莊的附業所遭遇的話，常銀風吃緊的時候，是無法塡補的。與此類似的例子，在重慶金融史上，可能我到十件以上，此次江慶錢莊之發生風波，也有人這樣議論過，認爲他在金融上或許吃過若干晤虧，以致弱點暴露，挽救無方。自然，推測自推測，可是，此種推測也不無理由。</p>
<p>所以，今日不言整理錢莊則已，若言整理，則當　根究底，找出銀錢　風險發　的　源，所謂病源，當歸之於信用放款，尤當歸之於短比存放，蓋短比存放，是招致　囤積投機的主要因素，雖然，市商會於本年春季力陳比　存放款管制辦法施行的若干困難，但害多而利少，這是今天社會人士一致的見解·雖然不一定主張立即廢除短比存放，如能採取更有効的辦法，短比存放的廢止，也是必要的·（嚴格說，短比存放純屬高利貸性質）。不然，以目前票據交換制度爲樞紐逐漸改變比期存放的舊習，與轉移信用投放的　務，未嘗不是一種方法。此次，爲了便於管理起見，對執行短比存放業務的錢荘，應加以有限制的登記，並須向國家銀行繳存相當於比期存款的若干百分比，作爲短比存放的保證金，這樣，才不致使存戶因風險而遭受損失。第三，除了執行經常的檢查制度外，並須在檢查行荘資產額的情形下，酌量合併若干資金缺乏的錢荘或銀號，藉使金融市塲的安全，得到更多的保障。第四，國家銀行應使正當放款之限制放寬，如此，才能减低短比存放的活躍程度，因爲今天短比存放在市塲上的異常活躍，無論明的或暗的，正說明社會上需要資金周轉，吾則，投放於短比的資金，絕無出路。許多公司或工廠，因爲向當局貸款感釗若干困難，常忍痛挪借此期放款，藉以調劑其資金。挖肉補瘡，決非根本的辦法啊！（三十二年一月十五日寄）</p>

<h3>法租界　人口移動問題</h3>
<p>— 民治</p>
<p>自從租界中實施保甲制度以來，成績很覺得不壞，尤其是在治安這方面更使人可高枕無憂。不過事情決不盡如理想，例如法租界方面最近發出通吿，謂人口移動問題不由聯保從中聯絡。由　自行負責，所以一切包括「索取移動證」「遞呈移動證」「申請身份證」「領身份證」等等，郡要集中舉行。在理想到這一點的人，一定以爲集中一切，减少困難，不過這一來却苦了老百姓。就以中央區來講，差不多有五六十聯保，以每聯保有五六十人一天移動，那來中央區每天就有二三千人等待辦理此事，每天辦公時間不過八小時，每小時以辦舉六十人，一天僅有五百人能完成，尙有一二千人只是呆站一天，所以弱一點的，數犬不能人其門，過了三天要　洋五十元，豈不寃哉。</p>
<p>依愚見不若仍余聯保從中聯絡，以期不失分工合作之眞義，移動證醫如恐人民浪費，可由聯保經售，則可免擁擠，及浪費時間，如以爲聯保辦事欠認眞，仍非區負責不可，則憑意以爲可分項目排隊進行，如「遞呈侈動證」「索收移動證」「申請身份證」等等各分一羣，各有所司，一方面加快工作，加多工作人員，使人民無留滯及荒却工作之虞。</p>

<h3>菲律賓的今昔</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>歷史的回顧</p>
<p>一五一九年九月二十日向從大西洋至太平洋新發現的海道出發的麥哲倫探險隊，完成了第一次的周遊世界。西班牙人在中國海（即南海）的海岸，獲得了羣島，那就是菲律賓羣島，那是四百多年以前的往事了。在這以前，菲律賓羣島已和中國人發生親密的連絡，因爲它不僅位居在南中國海上，而且，距離我國很近，從菲律賓之心臟的馬尼拉，到我們的香港，不過六百四十浬，如果從菲律賓最北端到台灣，就用古代的帆船，也只消三五天可到的。那時，菲律賓完全過着恬靜優美的生活，文化程度也已相常進步。可是，當西方人來到東土之後，菲律賓開始了被壓迫的命運。</p>
<p>麥哲倫於一五一九年九月二十日受西班牙王命出發，繞過南美洲而至太平洋，再横渡太平洋而至菲律賓，麥氏稱這羣島名爲聖拉撒路羣島，（San　Lazrus　Archipelago）西班牙人多呼爲西羣島，（Isles　de　Poniente）後來麥氏爲菲島居民所殺，殘部被逼退出。所以，那時西班牙雖然宣稱該島爲其領地，實則並未正式佔領，而葡萄牙人却已佔領菲島以南的摩鹿加有十多年了，那時葡人稱菲島爲東方羣島（Isles　de　Oriente，）禁止西班牙人侵入。後來西班牙人曾兩度遠征菲律賓，都沒有成功，（一五二五及一九二七）到了一五二九年，西葡兩國締結撒拉果撒條约，規定摩鹿加以東二百零七里的經綫爲界，西區屬葡，東區屬西，而菲律賓位在界綫以西。到了一五四二年，西班牙決意佔領，又派隊遠征，爲了紀念西班牙太子菲律二世，廢聖拉撒路之名而改稱菲律賓，不過那時菲島居民不斷反抗外國侵入者，西班牙遠征隊被逼逃遁。到了菲律二世登位，又於一五六四年大舉遠征，一面針對當時菲島居民尙無國家組織，內部各部落間利害衝突，進行縱横捭圔工作，到了一五七〇-七一年，又不斷增援，終於佔領全島，一方面修街道，築砲台，建營寨，一方面開始在葡人所從事的壟斷貿易之外，在那裏實行殖民地政治，並帶來了本國的封　關係，利用奴隸的勞動，進行種植和開礦的事業。</p>
<p>然而，西班牙人移殖菲島的，只是少數海盜，鉅商，敎徒和政客，他們是爲着自私自利而來的，只知奴役居民，從事勞力，寳藏等等的剝削掠奪，旣不知提高土人文化和政治水準，幫助他們建立新國家，更不知爲居民開闢人的生活」之途。西班牙統治菲島三百年間，菲島的土地，都給西班牙的軍人和敎士所有，菲人都成爲農奴。這些奴隸除了被壓榨至死以外，沒有前途可言，於是三百年間，不斷發生民族的反抗運動。結果爲新興的美帝國主義所乘，於一八九八年併夏威夷之後，立即進行奪取菲律賓的美西戰爭，結果西班牙祇得退出他蹂躪了三百年的東方最大殖民地，美國開始他對菲殖民的經營。</p>
<p>美國於一八九八年（淸光緒二十四年）美西戰爭中代西班牙而成爲菲島的支配者。當時美國經略菲島的最大目的，就是把它作爲美國對亞細亞通商貿易的根據地。美國經濟發達史證明，美國資本主義在二十世紀前夜，已經完成了國內的開發工作，那時體騐到生產過剩的恐慌，而其經濟機構，也因達到了高度資本主義階段而日漸加增其向海外膨脹的衝動。美國在對華貿易中雖然已經獲得小少利益，可是，在這個新興的帝國主義眼中，並不滿足，她還希望以全東亞廣大市塲之獲得爲對象而活動。在一九〇〇年前後，美國曾沿加利浦海沿岸向中美活動，接着便進一步推展其勢力到夏威夷，關島和菲律賓，在以武力爲經濟後盾的原則下，菲律賓成爲美帝國主義侵略束亞唯一的軍事和經濟的根據地。</p>
<p>美國在菲島的統治者曾說：「如果失去了菲律賓根據地，那麼太平洋上美國的發言權就不能不受到限制，那時美國的戰略根據地不能不退到夏威夷去了。菲律賓羣島使美國與日本和中國成爲直接隣接的東亞國家，也就是維護美國在亞洲貿易權利的前衛。」這些話說明了美國對菲的帝國主義的心肝。</p>
<p>地利的形勢</p>
<p>菲律賓居南洋羣島的東北部，约當北緯四度四十分至二十一度十分，東經一百十六度四十分至一百二十六度三十四分，東濱太平洋，西濱南中國海，南望西里伯斯島和婆羅洲，北對台灣島。全部島嶼，全數約七千零八十三座，呂宋（Luzcn）民答那峨（或稱棉蘭老Mindanao兩大島的佔全菲面積的三分之二，在三方公里以上的島嶼有四百多個，此外都是幾乎沒有居民的小島嶼。面積共約二十九萬六千二百九十四平方公里。</p>
<p>主要島嶼的面積如下：</p>
<p>島名　面積（單位一平方公里）</p>
<p>呂宋　一〇五·七〇八</p>
<p>民答那峨　九五·五八七</p>
<p>撒馬　一三·二七一</p>
<p>尼格羅　一二·六九九</p>
<p>巴撈溫　一一·六五五</p>
<p>班乃　一一·五二〇</p>
<p>民都洛　九·八二六</p>
<p>雷伊泰（李娣）　七·二四九</p>
<p>宿務　四·三九〇</p>
<p>保和　三·九七三</p>
<p>馬斯貝特　三·二五〇</p>
<p>其他　一七·一六六</p>
<p>計　二九六·二九四</p>
<p>從地形上看菲律濱是太平洋沿岸一羣火山島，山脈縱貫南北，島形參差，地面崎嶇。全菲著名火山的三十座，山坡有肥沃的火山土壤，島民築隄成梯田，河流多短促，利於灌溉而不利於舟楫交通。平原旣不多，而且僅有的也都狹小。</p>
<p>菲律濱位居亞洲東南海上，完全屬於熱帶區域，幸有海風調劑，還稱溫和，雨量充足。六月十一月間，西南風吹來，幾乎無日不雨，十二月至五月，則爲乾季，較爲乾燥。秋季常有颶風經過，捲着暴雨往往帶來了驚人災害，而且，氣候雖好，但人民與牲畜常受種種熱帶疾病的侵害。天花，　亂，映核疫，痳瘋，肺癆，瘧疾，與痢疾等，都成爲菲島居民應時時抵抗的大仇敵。此外家畜中也常常發生牛羊疫病。</p>
<p>菲律濱居民據最近一九三九年一月一日的調查，共計一千五百九十八萬四千二百四十七人，人口度約每一平方公里五三·九五人。較之一八九八年美國獲得菲島主權時，人口共增約九百萬。現在人口中，包含住在山島內文化水準尙低的「異敎徒」六十萬人，與住在民答那峨與蘇祿的回敎徒的四五十萬，此外大多數土人爲馬來族人，而華僑和中國與西班牙人的混血種人佔次多數，的有百分之八至十，共餘爲日本及歐美人。馬來族久受西方人的文化薰陶，特別是美國人的宗敎和文化的薰陶，知識漸開，文化程度已較別地的馬來人爲高，已有和華僑合設的民主，社會，和共產黨等組織，近數十年來，不斷和美國帝國主義進行爭取獨立的鬥爭。華僑人數，據一九三四年橋務委員會發表，計福建人八八、四〇〇人，廣東人二二、一〇〇人，共計十一萬一千零五百人，而久居菲島早已菲化及與西菲混血的中國人，尙未統計在內華僑在菲島，至少早於葡人麥哲倫至菲的那年，那麽應該有四百年以上的歷史了，慘淡經營，已成第二故鄕，他們與本地各族，相處怡然，而且由於安分守已，克勤克儉的特性，在經濟上早已確立不可動搖的根據。</p>
<h3>「五日熱」　已有特效藥</h3>
<p>「五日熱」，又稱「窩呂尼」「WOLHYNI」熱，可用阿的平及百司母困治愈，「窩呂尼」熱係一種由衣蝨傳染之寒熱病，病原認係「立克次」小體，發熱時間約一日至數日，熱退後又發，可以續發多次，共病情頗與瘧疾及流行性感冒類似，一九四三年二月八日柏林電稱，最近德軍某地軍醫院主任「美倫多」氏在東線治療「窩呂尼」熱之經過，原文已載德國醫學週刊，茲擇要摘錄於下。此症初起不易診斷，因類似症頗多，迨長期方有明顯判別，寒熱在初起時較爲劇烈，每可延至數日之久，退熱極速，立刻退淸，其特別症狀爲脛骨作痛，亦有頭痛關節痛薦骨痛等，此外尙有眼結膜炎及在初起時發生特殊紅疹之現象，在寒熱期痛楚最甚。</p>
<p>發作之距離的五日，以後之發作時間均漸較以往爲短，如此漸發漸輕，終於全愈，此症雖然來勢猛烈，但病人之一般狀態幷不十分萎頓，初起時每發紅疹故易與斑疹傷寒混淆，隨後方能分淸。</p>
<p>美氏因此症之病所謂一立克氏」小體，故用「阿的平」與「百司母困」治療，此兩藥原係瘧症專藥，美氏共用治六十症例，結果有不可吾認之優良功效，在大多數症例，經此等藥後（服七日）即已全愈，不再復發，此外一切痛楚，一經治療，亦無不即見大減。</p>
<p>美氏對於此項用「阿的平』與「百司母困」治療「窩呂尼」熱，有特別功效一點，極表滿意，並稱此項發現，堪與上次世界大戰時之發明人工瘧疾藥「百司母困」相媲美焉。（廣）</p>

<h3>經濟評言　有獎儲蓄與發行彩票</h3>
<p>最近國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郞氏對滬記者團發表談話，其中關於金融通貨問題部份有一段云：「目下在研究中，儲備券價値之提高，生產力之增强，物價之對策，民生之安定，此四者實爲培養戰力之基幹，其對策有下列方法：一方發行糧食庫券，作爲購買農村糧食之用，以抑制儲備券之放出；一方爲獎勵儲蓄起見，對儲蓄一定金額者予以獎金，日本雖無此種制度，但中國已實行，成績頗佳，將由中央儲備銀行積極實行之；彩票之發行雖尙未決定，但在滿洲及華北已實行，故此項辦法，當可推行。」</p>
<p>記者所欲評論者爲有獎儲蓄及彩票之發行二點。有獎儲蓄之在中國已有三十年歷史，最初（民三）由新華銀行試辦於北平，旋滬上萬國儲蓄會中法儲蓄會及中國實業銀行等繼起採行，最後乃由中央儲蓄會統籌全局。此法雖不免有鼓勵人民若干僥倖心之嫌，然處此非常時代，由中央儲備銀行積極推行，或足爲戰時財政金融一臂之助耳。至國家彩票之發行。在民國史上亦屢見不鮮，如民十之農商部發行有獎債券及民二十二年以還之發行航空公路建設獎券是也。就尋常倫理觀點言之，彩票券之爲物，賭博性色彩甚爲濃厚，國家將禁絕之不暇，尙何能推波助瀾，逕自經營乎？然就戰時人民之變態心理觀點言之，則投機也，居奇也，跑茶室也，入俱樂部也，瘋在地買賣烚赤花紗及證券也，何一而非賭博呢？雖云世風不古，然惡劣環境實階之厲，設政府能因勢利導，復行從事大規模戰時獎券之發行，以吸收一部份市上流浪無歸宿之游資，或不失爲非常時期內差强人意之善政歟。若政府能更進一步而切實禁賭，使因賭而起之殺人越貨侵呑公款等案件得絕跡塵寰，則尤阿彌陀佛，功德無量焉。</p>
<h3>中央儲蓄會將實行改組　即將發行彩票</h3>
<p>據支那情報載，參戰以後，當局曾草擬種種方案，以謀吸收遊資，並進而提高中儲券價値。其中之一即爲發行彩票。至於發行彩票之機關，關係當局有意利用中央儲蓄會。該會原爲中央銀行之外圍機關，辦理有獎儲蓄經已多年。十二·八後，該會被置於軍管理之下，惟以前辦理之有獎儲蓄，仍照常進行，目前參加此項儲蓄者，尙有數十萬戶左右，共中之大半係集中上海。最近關係當局均擬於最短期內，將該會解除軍管理，並實施改組，聘請上海財界有力人士爲董事，俟改組完竣後，卽將發行彩票事宜，交其辦理云。</p>
<h3>租界當局決將貫澈物價統制</h3>
<p>據支那情報載，租界當局鑒於一般物價自去年底以來一直昂騰，影饗市民生活極巨，決欲貫澈統制物價之現定方針，其所取辦法約如次：（一）抑制物價當以取締投機爲第一要務。今後對於黑市交易，決嚴厲取締，使奸商根本無跳躍之餘地。（二）對於生產。批發。零售之各種旣定公價，決强力維持，不使其稍有變通。（三）配給券制度，將儘速擴充及於各種生活必需品，以期安定民生云云。</p>
<h3>必需用品計口授給制</h3>
<p>漢口商界之改革經濟機構意見：</p>
<p>二月十八日大陸新報載稱一漢口日本商工會議所，對於申請加入零售配給組合之日商行號，一律令其解答日商經濟機構之原理，茲將各代表繕具之意見摘綠如下：</p>
<p>希望以商工會議所爲中心，設立一適應中日經濟提携之機構。希望設立中心機關，以便統一經濟機構，希望改善收購物資部份，其辦法：規定每一地區設一商行，負責進出口之調查。限制前綫商人之濫施經營，希望採用大規模商行主義。希望獎勵生產事業所需之各種機械，資材，原料進口。確立對中日人士之配給機構，全部必需品用計口授給制，一律遵守公定價値，俾可安定民生。希望華商明澈同生共死之觀念，拋棄過去之利己主義經營法。不問中日國籍，凡屬違反經濟法令者，希望從嚴處辦。以上之意見，均爲各日商之善意見解，如何採納，又常別論，但足見日商之關心物價一斑。</p>
<h3>上海銀行界力謀確立金融體制</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會委員中，上海經濟界，佔有十名，各方對於本市經濟界如何協力國府之施策，咸表注目，頃聞華方各銀行，已遵循國府之統制經濟辦法，自動準備協力，積極襄贊國府增强生產，維持幣値，抑平物價，按國府參戰之後，各方均在整頓確立戰時經濟體制，金融界亦均根據國府之國是，改換目標，對於成長於自由主義經濟中之金融機構，業務方針，投資關係等項，再加檢討，其目標爲以次數點，</p>
<p>（一）準備擴充地方金融網。</p>
<p>（二）檢討對投機用途之放款。</p>
<p>（三）整理投資於不生產部門之資金。</p>
<p>（四）動員資金運用於擴充生產方面。</p>
<p>已由有力銀行根據此項目標，草擬金融新體制方案，預定經銀行公會，產業公會兩機關協商之後向國府提出。</p>
<h3>各行莊設儲蓄部　吸收游資入於生產正途</h3>
<p>二月十八日大陸新報載稱，上海之銀錢業各行莊，根據戰時經濟政策綱領，分別設立儲蓄部，吸引民衆之儲蓄，原則上以普通存款爲主，但定期存款亦收，俾可吸收游資至生產方面，而避免游資被人利用充作投機或囤貨之用，其利息規定普通存款一厘至四厘，定期存款五厘至一分。</p>
<h3>市塲絢爛之餘　華股昨稍軟化</h3>
<p>昨華商投股市况，止漲回跌，實因近來升騰過巨，握有股券者心思轉動，紛起求脫，且爲傳說，情况頓趨軟化。但有數種股票買勢迄未稍减，仍在向上進展中，如文化業中之商務股票，缺少售出，買戶已喊高至九百元，正午八百八十元，又升三十元之巨。查自一月十二日發動漲勢來，上升適達一倍，共升四百三十五元，中華最高見三百十五元，但不久回退至三百〇二元半，又升二元半，亦於是日上升以來共漲一百四五十元，世界書局較爲軟弱，由一百八十七元半步降至一百七十八元，午刻稍回升爲八十元，獨低十元，新藥業中，新亞藥廠在新老投資買勢中，哄見三十一元五角高價，後亦隨之回下爲三十元，尙升一元七角半之巨。中法已回入四十元關內，一度由四十一元步降見三十七元七五，午刻被提上至三十九元，軋小七角半，民誼小挫至六十三四元，信誼平疲爲三百十五元，大中華火柴又升五元，盤於四百四十元左右，南洋烟公司變動亦巨，一見二百三十七元半，回瀉爲二百二十元，至午刻二十五元，公用業下跌頗巨，閘北水電由一百三十七元半做小至一百二十五元，午刻二十七元，軋小十元，尙屬連升七十元〇五角後之小回風也。華商電氣盤於九十元關左右，小二元。百貨業恍惚下挫，永安公司一百九十元關衝出後重見回入，由一百九十二元一度傾瀉至一百八十一元半，午刻復升至一百八十六元，回小二元。新新公司二百〇七元半降至一百九十六元，後回升至二百元左右。國貨公司在九十二四元左右，亦小五元至三元。紡織業永安紗廠一見四百八十二元半，即狂退至四百五十元，午刻六十二元半，大生一廠七百元，三廠五百六十元，仍少售出。小票面穩定，美綸毛絨昂近二十元，同豐印染升至十三元，公和五十八元，中興木業再升至十三元半，市勢均佳，交易不旺。</p>
<h3>丙種公債出八十元</h3>
<p>公債行市，昨又回高，竟衝出八十元大關。交易雖不多，行市上落甚鉅。丙種由七十七元九角，升至八十二元五角，最後為零一二角，甲種做七十八元。乙種七元至七元三角，丁種七十六元，戊種七十六元八角，大約為賣方補回之故。</p>
<h3>日用品交易雖稀　還是有漲無跌</h3>
<p>日用品市面，交易淸稀聲中，依然堅挺。鳳風牌火柴五千二百元，美麗牌五千三百元，比上日復昂二百元。金鼎牌四千三百元，什牌二千九百元，未更動。固本皂九百八十元，白祥茂九百念元，黄祥茂八百三十元，剪刀皂九百五十元。白禮氏洋燭五百八十元，僧帽牌五百三十元，什牌三百八十元，趨勢繼見有漲無跌。</p>

<p>近年來上海新公司之設立，風起雲湧，盛極一時，其中尤以新創立之銀行，錢莊，保險公司，企業公司，實業公司爲更多。考其組織，大寧爲股份有限公司。爲便利創業人之進行起見，特就設立股份有限公司應知之法定手續，蒐集資料，彙編成篇，以供參考。</p>
<p>（甲）法律規定之要點：</p>
<p>一、發起人認足股份與公開募足股份公司法第八十七條：「股份有限公司應有七人以上爲發起人。」第九〇條：發起人認足股份總數時，應即按股繳足第一次股款，並選任董事監察人。」第九十三條：「發起人不認足股份者，應募足股份總數。」公司法施行法第二十六條：「股份有限公司發起人所認股份總數，不得少於股本總額二十分之一；其股本總額在百萬元以下者，不得少於十分之一。」是公司之設立，有由發起人認足股份者，亦有由發起人認繳股份之一部份，另向外界公開招募一部份者。惟發起人所認股份，不得少於總額二十分之一：股本總額在百萬元以下者，不得少於十分之一。又公司法施行法第二十三條規定：「凡設立股份有限公司，應先備具營業計劃書，發起人姓名經歷及認股數目，連同招股章程，由全體發起人具名，呈由主管官署備案後，方得開始招股；但發起人認足股份總額時，得不備具招股章程。」公司法第九十九條規定：「第一次股款繳足後，發起人應於三個月內召集創立會。」第一〇二條規定：「創立會應選任董事監察人。」是發起人認足股份總數者，得免開創立會，可逕由發起人選任董事監察人；而公開招募一部份股額者，則於第一次股款繳足後，應於三個月內召開創立會，由創立會中選舉董事監察人。惟發起人之股份，依公司法第一一六條，在公司開始營業後一年內，不得轉議。（待續）</p>
<h3>股市塲外</h3>
<p>漢冶萍煤鐵礦股票不久前尙僅十八，九元，至本週內忽自二十一元一躍而至五十元外，此種特殊漲勢，察其原因，恐不外：一，該股票去歲昇漲無幾，市價不及票面一半。二，市上籌碼奇緊，致冷僻如礦業股票，竟亦爲購戶所重視。</p>
<p>新春以來，初上市之新股，又有多種，如聯華地產，同濟染織，中興木業，開拍後亦均搜購有人，交易不寂。華股籌碼本患不足，當茲老股籌碼供不敷求之際，新股如能源源登塲，自足恰合市塲實際需要。查自有新股上市以來，各方不乏愼重將事者，蓋誠恐陷入以往之覆轍也。</p>
<p>康元製罐廠股票脚地素稱堅穩，最近數日，因有發息優厚消息，及鐵皮漲勢銳厲等關係，人心一致向上，價格上漲甚速。默察最近趨勢，或尙有續漲可能。</p>
<h3>聯鈔又小三分</h3>
<p>昨晨錢業公會拆息未更，仍一角八分。</p>
<p>日軍票平定，同業互做價五元五角五分三五厘，小錢莊與銀號門市出入價仍五元五角六分及四分半。聯銀券又小三分，經營者售出三元九角半，收進三元九角。</p>
<h3>香煙本客　銷塲俱寂</h3>
<p>香烟市面，續呈軟勢，蓋本客銷塲薄弱，價乃一致向下。計大英牌一寓三千四百元，老刀牌一萬零五百五十元，品海牌八千五百五十元，仙女牌八千一百五十元，五華牌七千二百五十元。日烟金槍牌三千三百元，金大樓四千二百五十元紅玫瑰二千八百五十元，全祿牌三千九百五十元，念枝三千四百五十元，指南牌三千三百元。國烟金字塔七千八百元，美麗牌七千三百五十元，金鼠牌四千四百元，白金龍四千八百元，均較上日回降五十元至一百元不等。</p>
<h3>家庭藥品欲跌又止</h3>
<p>家庭藥品市面，一度疲軟昨市做開價仍見挺秀。計頭痛粉四十七元，萬金油五十九元，八卦丹五十元，鷓鴣菜八十二元，龍虎人丹五十元，較上日價格回昇甚勁。</p>
<h3>棉布續見下降</h3>
<p>昨晨布市，續見下沉成交仍稀。細布低落五六元，四君子嗶嘰自十三元二角作開，逐步趨低，午時降至十二元九角較上日軋降四角，色布桃花女士林五二五元。</p>

<h3>竹節鋼條價仍高昂</h3>
<p>昨市竹節鋼條交易，依然難見熱鬧。最大原因，當係本埠建築事業衰落，客銷停頓所致。然其行情，却因存底薄弱之故，反見高昂。刻市如三四分花色每噸售一萬五千元，五分至一寸每噸沽一萬四千五百元，統花色每噸標準價一萬四千元。此外路皮頭每噸一萬五千元，三角鐵頭每噸一萬二千元，洋元方板頭每噸一萬一千元，黑鐵皮頭每噸二萬八千元，烟皮頭每噸沾三萬元。（以上花色酌加）。</p>
<h3>南北貨市况一斑</h3>
<p>蘇杭幫辦紅黑棗　近因蘇杭幫蠢動，加以產價吿漲，市突趨高。刻市黑棗統手售七百元至七百二十元，博平頭高莊售九百元至一千元，廣府黑棗頭售一千一二百元。樂陵紅棗頭戶開六百八十元，紅棗王售七百五十元，特王棗售八百元。一元。</p>
<p>桂圓途貨裝出　大式什路桂圓，因鼓嶼輪隻軋缺，已有月餘無到貨。昨據客方電訊已有一批裝出，但數額不多，後期輸尚未悉，故此間業外手貨既不多出，暫乏鬆象。</p>
<p>金山元枝價微升　近雖乏到，但申市存數尙多，實以執貨者堅持，故價格轉緊，昨市又開出數百箱，貨品尙佳，比前又升二十元，有轉定之象</p>
<h3>工商行名録出版</h3>
<p>許晚成主編之本年度工商行名錄，業已出版。關於本外埠工廠公司商號等營業概况，董事經理姓名查載明確，洋裝一厚册，特價一百廿元，由北京路鹽業大樓龍文書店發行。</p>
<h3>「食少事繁」的美國　食品减少——工作加多</h3>
<p>據二月十七日巴西京城電稱：美國農業部宣佈，本年美國農產百分之二十五，將以供應美國軍隊與享受租借法權利之國家，以是本年美國境內准予售賣之各項食品，將較去年之數量，大爲减低。同時，據二月十七日里斯本電稱：美國全國職工工作時間，前已由每星期四十小時延長爲四十八小時，惟最近鑒於中要戰時工業仍有增加工作時間之必要，結果恐須延長爲每星期五十二小時云。</p>
<h3>華中通貨工作底發展（一）</h3>
<p>一·軍票在華底地位：</p>
<p>使用軍票，決不是由中國事變及大東亞戰爭時開端的，同時也更不是單單日本底專利品。然而，使用軍票範圍之廣大，期間之悠久，同其周圍關係之複雜，這實在可以說，是中國事變及大東亞戰爭所造成。在目前，菲律賓，香港，馬萊亞等地，雖然也都普遍地使用軍票，但其能出人頭地者，無論在發行額方面，也無論在當地經濟所佔的地位方面，不能不說是華中華南底軍票。</p>
<p>此次中國事變期間，軍票並沒通用到全中國。在華北，一直到今天尙未通用，最初以朝鮮銀行鈔票，河北銀行鈔票發軍隊底餉錫，後來聯合準備銀行成立，就由聯鈔取而代之。在業中，最初曾以日本銀行鈔票支付當地軍費，從民國二十六年十一月起改用軍票，這是爲防止由日鈔發行額增高而生日金低落底應有方法。但華南，在民國十七年七月，帝國軍隊在北海登陸以來，就通用軍票。這種華中華南軍票，同現在所謂南方圈各地方通用的軍票，並不相同，後者主要地是充作當地通貨底煤介物。</p>
<p>華中軍票底一般輪廓，雖然像上而所說，但我們沿着這一軍票發展底行跡着，決不是完全走的平坦大道。因爲當地存在着根深蒂固，且擁有中國民衆信賴的舊法幣，於是必然遭受其正面襲擊。前年六月，軍票與儲備劵成爲十八比一百，儲備券與舊法幣成爲一比二底兌換率；但在三四年前，民國二十九年初，法幣百元，按上海兌換率爲軍票七十八元，該年十月成爲六十元，民國三十年一二月爲五十八元，三月末爲五十元，從九月末至十月初降爲三十元，該月二十二日又喊出二十七元價，一入十一月則一落千丈，該月十一日竟降爲二十二元又四分之一，月底曾少微轉高，大東亞戰爭爆發底那一天，雖回至三十元以上，但這比起民國二十九年初，還降落了二倍半，眞有不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發後，軍票對法幣底比價，從十五日後官價定爲二十五元起，這一比價曾繼續了一個時期，但一入三月，則成爲十三元，在該月底，取消新舊法幣等價交換，聲明以軍票支持儲鈔，五月以後舊法幣落爲九元，六月八日以後，新舊法幣底比價爲一比二，軍票與儲鈔規定爲十八對一百。（季譯自一月二十七日東京經濟學者堀新一原著）</p>

<h3>只當</h3>
<p>— 茹靈</p>
<p>一個人不論做什麽事，必須有疑，疑則進步。譬如做一件事或讀一本書，做的事是不循正途的，讀的書是不切實用的。旁人指正你，你不聽，自作主張，旁人勸吿你，你不納，自以爲是，一旦眞相暴露，懊悔已經不及，於是替自己解嘲：「我只當如此而己」。「只當」就是不肯研究，不肯懷疑。古往今來，這二字不知葬送了多少人才的前途，摧殘了多少英雄的大業。</p>
<p>淸代大學問家崔東璧（述）先生，生平最恨以「只當」爲口頭禪的敷衍人物，他用「打破沙鍋問（紋）到底」的實事求是精神來治史治學，「考信錄」這部巨著就是用這種苦幹精神換來的。他有一首「只當行」，痛斥「只當」之非，有云：</p>
<p>「不視所以觀所行，只當兩字胸中橫，儀秦辨口如縣河，技窮其如只當何，前者只當己知誤，後者只當己不悟，世間大病皆可醫，惟有只當無法施」。</p>
<p>「只當」是一切事業的大阻礙，蘋果墜地，旁人只當是平常事，牛頓却發明了萬有引力定律。八十年前，安迪生的母親假使也同旁人一般，只當自己兒子是個頑童痴子，今日地球上，怕還沒有電燈這玩意兒吧。</p>
<p>打倒「只當」，這誤盡芸芸衆生的二個字眼！</p>
<h3>一月份徵文録取第三名　我的教員生活（上）</h3>
<p>— 斯亦爲</p>
<p>幾近二十年的敎員生活，雖然已將我拖累了有着半頭白發，可是每一玩味，却覺得正似咬菜根，嚼橄欖，於淸淡酸澀之餘，却亦自有其幽香甜潤之處。</p>
<p>我的敎員生活的開始，是在大學獲任助敎，前後約有七八年之久。這幾年因爲厠身於博碩之林，所得的學議經騐，着實比在中學時代多幾倍。當時因為初作人師，什麼盡格外努力，預備惟恐不達。我學的是生物學一科，暮憶為學生預備實騐材料。總要到午夜回宿舍就寢，日裏改卷上課，實無空暇，當然一方面須得防被學生問倒，因而看不起助敎，但多半是爲了求知心的驅使，與在課室裏應回答學生疑問時所得到的愉快的鼓動，是以忘其疲勞！在實騐室裏，當學生有些觀察不淸楚時，我總覺得比自己不能觀察淸楚還難過！極力自耐反覆誘導，務使其得有滿足的觀感，因爲我在求學的時代，最恨的是先生一副神氣活現的面孔，怕得使學生不敢親近，有問就隨便敷衍作答了事，所以我自己常常勉勵着决不染上這習慣。不過在幾十個學生中間，接連着幾個鐘點的實騐，到後來精神總不免於疲乏，這時如果學生還是一問再問，顯微鏡募替他尋檢出來的東西，不見了又來請求重尋的時候，就不能自制，說出氣憤的話來，於是理會敎誨不倦，循循善誘，這兩句話實行的困難了！在這幾年裏我所得到的最大敎訓，就是敎即是學！學，負責任在我一人，敎，却須替多人負責，悞我自己事小，悞人子弟事大。</p>
<p>厥後因爲身心的過於勞乏，我終於病倒了，病得我不許再敎書！可是爲了環境，爲了生活，又不得不敎書，後來又到內地的一個中學裏去任生物敎師，這裏因爲地方環境的良好，沒有像在大學裏時的忙苦，更其是學校當局的信任有加，讓我對於生物一課，自由的發展，靑年兒童天眞爛漫對於向學的熱情，使我的身體一天天的好了起來。這時我就因爲課本不合時地之宜，就偷閒自編動植物混合敎材，自發實騐指導，創設住物硏究會，調查當地生物環境頗能給學生留下些實騐態度以及認眞實行的精神，這中學在該鎮算是一個唯一的最高學府，所以敎師難受一般社會人士的尊敬，敎育局更指定在小學敎育會裏爲當然的顧問，因此頗有幾位小學裏的自然敎師不時將路旁拿些花草蟲豸來問名稱類別，這些東西我從未在學校念書的時候念過見過，所以自己覺得很窘，於是不得不自己下些工夫，買了幾本參考書，自己硏究，在三年間，我認識了許多的野花野草，使我在課室裏的講授，增加許多材料。</p>
<p>記得我辭却那邊敎職臨行的一天，正是大雪紛飛，同學們却冒着大雪來攝影送行當晨二點鐘啟輪，船艙上又有好幾位男女同學，在殘月寒光之下，踏着雪在等候，他們將我的行李，都親自送上艙中，替我安頓好了，始於最後的氣笛聲中揮手道別，這一幕依依話別的情形，使我在三年裏所受一切的辛勞都忘個亁淨。</p>
<p>事變後一切情形突變，首蒙其苦的爲我們做敎師的人。四五年來，總算還沒有將這敎鞭丢棄，依舊站在自己的本位上，現將這幾年的生活，分幾方面來說一說。</p>
<h3>辛勞的發掘者</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>科學家吿訴我們：人是由猿人進化而來。</p>
<p>但是科學家們不能空口說白話，他必須要提拱確鑿的證據—猿人的遺骨出來，否則將無從證明他們的主張。</p>
<p>於是，我們的發掘者葉夫根·裘布阿博士，在十九世紀末，拋棄安靜的荷京亞摩斯德爾登大學解剖學敎授的職務，而投軍做荷蘭殖民地軍隊的軍醫，毅然出發到遙遠的蘇門答臘島去。</p>
<p>裘布阿到了蘇門答臘之後，立刻便很熱心的從事搜尋，發掘。過了一個月，又是一個月，甚至於第三個月，所挖掘的泥土堆積成山，但是猿人的骨頭却仍無絲毫影踪。</p>
<p>假使別人在裘布阿的地位，也許早就放棄這毫無結果的發掘了，因爲猿人的骨頭旣不一定在這地方，而所應該發掘的地方却又是這樣遼闊呵！</p>
<p>但是我們的裘布阿仍不折不撓的發掘下去，一年，二年……。</p>
<p>裘布阿的悲哀不祇一次，而他也不祗一次的咬著牙幹下去。他始終不放棄他的信仰。</p>
<p>在蘇門答臘沒有找到猿人，他決定到爪哇島上去碰碰運氣。</p>
<p>在這裏，他終於碰到運氣了。</p>
<p>在克登山脚下的賓格望河的河床裏，他找到猿人的兩顆牙齒，一隻大腿骨，一個腦蓋</p>
<p>辛勞的發掘者畢竟發現了他的寳藏，他的不折不撓的精神使他成功了。</p>
<p>信仰便是力量，—前人的敎訓告訴我們。</p>
<p>還在自己田園裏發掘寳藏的人們，當你感到失望的時候，你可別忘記你還得咬着牙發掘下去。因爲在你的田園裏並不是沒有寳藏，而是你的努力還未達到最高的階段。</p>
<p>培養你的勇氣，忍耐和力量，去做一夕辛勞的發掘者，在未來，你的努力將得到酬報。</p>
<h3>決斷力</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>多麽可惜啊！世界上多少偉大的事業全被「躊躇不決」四個字所敗壞了。多少聰明與才能被它埋沒了。</p>
<p>伏爾太說：「躊躇是品性上極明顯的缺點。」沒有堅强的品格，那麽他一生是沒有目的的，旁人和他自己都不知道他下一節點要去做什麽，好像一隻沒有風帆和舵的船，永遠隨着風浪東飄西蕩，直到觸到了暗礁或是大風浪時立刻撞得粉碎。</p>
<p>成功的機會往往是突然而來的，你一定要用決斷力去抓住它，不要一會兒想到這種，一刻兒又想到那邊，你寗願決斷之後做不成功，却不可養成遷延的習慣，因爲做總比不做的成功機會要多。</p>
<p>所謂決斷是智慧的決斷，因爲愚笨的人也會下決斷，但那只是執拗的決斷，智慧的決斷是靠了理智和自信力的仔細考慮的，而執拗的決斷只是憑着個人的成見不加思考而頑固堅持的決斷，所以兩者是絕對不相同的。</p>
<p>莎士比亞說：「我要牢記，當凱撒說做這個時候，就給他做成了。」這句話大家應該牢記。</p>
<h3>生活高壓下的健康問題</h3>
<p>— 肇文</p>
<p>生活的威脅，增加了健康問題的重要，這在社會上大多數依靠工作而生活的人們，是最深切感覺得到的，因爲在身體健康的時候，憑個人在工作上的努力，總還可以維持最低的生活，可是一旦失去健康，在一般平時毫無積蓄的人，非但感到無法解決生活問題，同時醫藥負擔，跟蹤而來，那就不免陷於萬分痛苦的境地了。</p>
<p>所以在這生活高壓之下，每個工作的人們，都應當十二分注重自己的健康，應當把健康看做生活的資本，小心翼翼地來保持這個生活的資本，不短少，不喪失，因爲這是在生活高壓下而生活的最重要的一個先决問題。</p>
<p>作者對於保待生活的資本，—健康—提出下列三點，促使大家注意。</p>
<p>（一）防病於無病（二）知病於未着（三）治病於初病</p>
<p>關於第一點，須平時注意一切衛生，第二·三點，應每年施行健康檢查，因爲有許多潛伏的疾病，自己毫不知覺，一經檢查，立時可以發現，因發現得早，而早期治療，旣易恢復健康，又可節省醫藥費用，同時早早恢復工作，封於生活問題，也不致發生重大影響。</p>
<p>本市最近成立了一個中國保健公司，它的工作，是着重於健康檢查，而達到保持健康。顧名思義，該公司對於增進市民的健康一點，今後應有相當的貢獻，我們於此實寄予無限的希望。</p>

<h3>Wartime Social Problems - Encouraging the Establishment of the Ministry of Social Welfare</h3>
<p>Social problems, to put it correctly, are actually political problems. Social administration should be the most important department in a nation's administration. In peacetime, when the nation's politics are on the right track, society is stable, prosperous, and progressive, then the highest ideal of "everyone doing their best, the land yielding its full potential" can be realized. Therefore, all modern and advanced countries attach great importance to social administration to seek the welfare of the social populace. As for wartime, the implementation of all policies, including military, political, and economic ones, and the thorough implementation of national wartime strategies, rely even more on the stability of social order and the rationalization of people's lives. Only then can the mobilization program be realized, total war become a reality, and ultimate victory be expected.</p>
<p>Since the National Government entered the war, it has been working hard to establish a wartime system, and it has been advancing in various aspects of politics, economy, and military affairs. According to a Nanjing dispatch on the 11th of this month, "Since the Supreme National Defense Council resolved to establish the Ministry of Social Welfare, the ministry has been established in accordance with the provisions of the organizational law. Now, in order to manage social welfare, promote charity, and guide the people, the ministry has specially established the People's Political Guidance Department, the Public Welfare Department, the Disaster Relief Bureau, the Social Simple Insurance Bureau, the General Affairs Bureau, the Physical Fitness Bureau, the Labor Department, and the Vocational Department. When necessary in matters, the administrative departments can increase or reduce the various departments, bureaus, divisions, committees, and other agencies under its jurisdiction with the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan." It can be seen that the authorities are paying close attention to and appropriately handling wartime social administration and social welfare. In addition to eagerly expecting the ministry to truly shoulder the responsibilities of wartime social welfare and people's political guidance, we, standing from the people's perspective, contribute some opinions and call for the attention of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>We have not yet seen the organizational law of the National Government's Ministry of Social Welfare, but from the above-mentioned telegram, we can already see its main tasks: First, it is to "manage social welfare and promote charity," which seems to actively solve social problems, so its nature seems to be similar to the labor departments of European and American countries, because in countries with developed industries, the biggest social problem is the labor problem. However, based on the actual social situation in our country, industry is not developed, and laborers only account for a very small percentage of the national population, and they are not the most important problem in social problems. Naturally, there is no need to imitate European and American countries by establishing a special labor department. Therefore, social administration in China generally refers to passive relief. For example, the "Ministry of Health and Welfare" newly established in Japan during the war seems to have a similar purpose to our Ministry of Social Welfare. However, our country is still an agricultural country, and Japan is a country where industry and financial capital have developed to the highest stage. Their social problems also have fundamentally different content. Japan's biggest social problems are: First, wartime relief work, which includes two different tasks: one is to provide relief to national refugees and impoverished compatriots, to achieve the state where the young are educated, the adults have jobs, and the elderly are cared for. The second is to help the impoverished compatriots in various places, mainly to provide relief to the vast salary class, from school teachers and staff to middle and lower-level civil servants in government agencies and groups. Currently, many people's salary income is insufficient to maintain the minimum living standards, and planned, universal, and practical relief must be carried out. Second, preferential treatment should be given to military police and their families, and preferential treatment should be given to workers in agriculture, industry, transportation, culture, and other departments related to combat, and appropriate policies should be formulated and universally and practically implemented. Third, the determination of reasonable land policies and countermeasures for peasant problems, especially the protection of owner-cultivators and tenant farmers, the punishment of land waste and non-cultivation, and the restriction of floating capital land speculation and land consolidation, are all of great importance to increasing wartime production and promoting peaceful construction, and should be given attention early on. Fourth, regulations should be made on wartime industry and labor-capital issues. On the one hand, industries that are necessary for wartime should be encouraged, and on the other hand, excessive wartime profiteering should be restricted, and the treatment of workers should be improved. In addition, the implementation of wartime social insurance, the promotion of cooperative movements, the implementation of talent registration and job placement, the promotion of social service personnel guidance, and the universal establishment of nurseries, kindergartens, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and public national affordable pharmacies and hospitals should all be urgently promoted by those in charge of social welfare today.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned telegram, it is also known that the newly established Ministry of Social Welfare, in addition to social welfare and charitable affairs, also manages "people's political guidance." Therefore, a "People's Political Guidance Department" has also been specially established. It is not uncommon for society to concurrently manage people's organization and training affairs. Especially in wartime, this kind of "people's political guidance" is naturally the most important work to cooperate in promoting the government's mobilization of national manpower. Even from the perspective of social administration itself, the following tasks must also be promoted with effort: First, the determination and implementation of the people's political guidance and organization and training program, earnestly solving various difficulties and disputes for the people, and guiding the people's wartime life onto the right track. Second, the establishment of population policies, adjusting the distribution of the population, the distribution of laborers and peasants, such as the dispersal of urban populations, the transplantation and reclamation of refugees and exiles, and the planned distribution and adjustment of labor for industrial and mining production, can also be strengthened. "Total war participation" is also a work that must be prepared in advance for post-war peaceful construction. Third, promoting wartime national life, transforming social customs, especially assisting relevant agencies, jointly eliminating speculative businesses, opium gambling prostitution, eradicating the evil forces of local tyrants and evil gentry, eliminating the extravagant and lewd atmosphere of large cities, and revitalizing the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, diligence, frugality, simplicity, and loyalty. The above trivial matters seem to be the most important things that the Ministry of Social Welfare should do first in "guiding the people's politics."</p>
<p>Finally, we cannot but solemnly point out that, as we have always advocated, the solution of social problems cannot rely solely on some principles and some laws. The most important thing is to rely on social figures to handle it, to elect appropriate figures from the private sector to handle it, and the government should stand in a position of guidance and supervision. Therefore, the structure of social administrative agencies and the personnel themselves do not need to be too complicated, and the local social undertakings and public welfare organizations in the private sector should also be given the greatest assistance by the government, so that all sectors of society can jointly discuss and solve social problems. What cannot be ignored is that the emergence of social problems is mainly during wartime. The existence of speculation and the failure to prohibit exorbitant profits will further widen the gap between the rich and the poor and increase social unrest. Therefore, the essence of social administration lies first in ensuring that wartime welfare is evenly distributed, the old and young have support, and there are no regrets in life and death; and then in ensuring that everyone gives full play to their talents and the land yields its full potential, so that the government's social administration can be considered successful. May the Ministry of Social Welfare and all sectors of society encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Xiao Shuxuan Meets with Reporters to Discuss the Military Conference - More Than 160 Proposals Were Passed and Will Be Implemented One by One by the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Second National Military Conference, which grandly opened in Nanjing on the 15th, successfully concluded on the 17th. After the meeting, Xiao Shuxuan, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the Propaganda Department at 4:00 p.m. on the 18th to report on the progress of the conference. According to him, "The purpose of this conference was to enable generals from all over the country to deeply understand the significance of the National Government and friendly countries cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and formally declaring war on Britain and the United States. The conference lasted for three days, and Chairman Chiang personally attended and presided over it throughout, and repeatedly gave earnest instructions. The generals attending were extremely moved by the Chairman's hard work and dedication. A total of more than 160 proposals, all related to establishing security in the rear, expanding the garrison area, education, training, clothing, and supplies, were thoroughly discussed and all passed. They will be implemented one by one by the Military Affairs Commission. During the conference, Advisor Teraoka, Information Minister Iwasaki, and others gave speeches on current affairs and the war situation, and Chief of the General Staff Kawabe and Ambassador Shigemitsu held banquets and discussions. The generals attending were very excited to be able to exchange views with the officials of friendly countries. Therefore, the atmosphere of the conference was always harmonious, and it came to a successful conclusion with many gains," and so on.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The National Military Conference has now successfully concluded. Generals from all over the country gathered in the capital and have not yet returned to their defense areas. Yesterday (18th) at 7:00 p.m., Xiao Shuxuan, Acting Chief of the General Staff, Secretary-General Huang Ziqiang, and General Superintendent of Training Ye Pengsan, specially held a joint celebration for the generals who came to Nanjing from various places. Many people, including Qi Xieyuan, attended, and the gathering ended with satisfaction after 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The Chief of the General Staff's Report at the Second National Military Conference</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Excerpts from the report of the Chief of the General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission at the Second National Military Conference are as follows: "Since the First National Military Conference the year before last, the situation in Greater East Asia has undergone great changes and progress, and our country's military has also undergone some reforms. In order to review the past and plan for the future, I would like to submit a report on the adjustment of the central military organization, the collective training of officers, the reorganization of troops, and the maintenance of security in the rear. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The significance of the reorganization of the central military organization and the situation after the reorganization. In order to strengthen the Chairman's command authority, the commission specially adjusted the central military organization in October last year, merging the responsibilities of the General Staff Headquarters, the Military Training Department, the Political Training Department, and the various departments of the Ministry of Military Affairs into the Ministry of the Army. Except for personnel and command-related matters that are directly managed by the Military Affairs Commission, and financial affairs that are still managed by the Financial Superintendent's Office in accordance with the independent nature of military needs, all the rest are incorporated into the Ministry of the Army, so that military orders, military administration, military training, and political training become unified. Also, in response to the needs of reality, the General Office of the Compilation and Training Superintendent was established to undertake the work of reorganizing and training the national army, and it bears a major responsibility for the consolidation and improvement of the national army. In order to realize the staff system, a Chief of the General Staff was specially established to assist the Chairman in managing everything and to be responsible for coordinating and guiding the contributions of various departments in order to achieve smooth handling of military affairs and improve the efficiency of army building. Since its implementation, it has been going smoothly. However, the political training organization is not very complete, and there should be some reforms in the future. Regarding the navy, it has gradually been enriched with the assistance of friendly countries, and naval bases have also been added. Education and training have been continuously strengthened and have made considerable progress. The air force has increased the number of aircraft with the assistance of friendly countries. Education and training are still in progress, and internal adjustments are also underway.</p>
<p>(2) Education and training situation. Regarding the education of military officers and students, since the Central Army Military Academy implemented specialized education last year, it has been proceeding in an orderly manner. The first class of students will soon graduate. In addition, the Military Training Corps was changed to the Junior Officer Training Brigade, and under the same education system as the military academy, it recently graduated and was assigned to the troops for appointment. The junior levels of the national army have gradually been refreshed. In addition, in order to standardize the education of various troops and unify the spirit and ideology, the Central Army General School Training Corps has selected officers from various troops to come to Beijing for training in batches. Four terms have already graduated, especially the fourth term students, who are in the midst of participating in the war, and their enthusiasm for joining the corps is even more radiant. Compared with the previous three terms, they have made even greater progress. Officers from various departments are usually scattered in various places and cannot easily meet. By taking this opportunity to gather together, their feelings and will can be communicated with each other, and they can also get close to the chiefs of the various departments in the central government, and listen to their instructions from time to time, especially by personally receiving the inspiration of the great personality of the Chairman, and they have gained great effects in sincere unity and ideological correction. After returning to their units, the connections between the various troops are more intimate. It is believed that they can be effective in both peacetime and wartime and can improve unity. In the future, higher-level military and research classes will be added to make up for the lack of staff officer education and to conduct collective training of officers at the same time, in order to strengthen the education of the national army's cadres and improve the quality of the army.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganization of various troops. Regarding the reorganization of various troops, the commanders of various troops have shown a spirit of voluntary reorganization, rather than being forced to implement it by senior officers. After the reorganization, the treatment of officers and soldiers is also very reasonable, so there are no complaints. The progress of the compilation and training is quite satisfactory. Recently, the Garrison Division and the Independent 14th Brigade were merged into the 2nd Garrison Division. The commander of the former division and the commander of the brigade were able to deeply understand the errors of the past concept of private soldiers in the army, so they were very willing to comply, which is highly commendable.</p>
<p>(4) The importance of maintaining security in the rear after participating in the war. When I took office as Chief of the General Staff, it happened to be the time when the participation in the war was announced. When I visited senior officers of friendly forces, they all expressed the hope that our country would train the national army to ensure security in the rear, because if our army can truly ensure security in the rear and expand the garrison area, friendly forces can transfer their troops to the front line, and we can also expand the peaceful area as a result, so as to promote the awareness of the Chongqing side and make the people of the whole country have a deeper understanding of the fact that friendly countries have no territorial ambitions and do not infringe on sovereignty. What friendly countries expect from our army is clear, so in the future, the reorganization of the national army will be carried out gradually in a progressive and rational manner, so as to enhance the strength of the national army, so that it can carry out joint activities with friendly forces in local defense and operations, so as to achieve the task of ensuring security.</p>
<h3>General Hata Issues a Statement After Inspecting the Jinhua Area</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, returned here on the 17th after inspecting the front-line troops and general military situation in the vicinity of Jinhua and Lanxi on the 16th. When meeting with reporters today, he said that the Chongqing army on both sides of Jinhua and Lanxi initially came to counterattack, but they were all repelled by the Japanese army. Now the Chongqing army sees that the recovery of that area has been declared hopeless, so its strength has been greatly reduced, and its morale is also extremely negative. The number of residents returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day, and once the road is fully open, it will be more prosperous than in the past. The electricity facilities in Jinhua have been restored, and the population has increased to more than 30,000. Most of the shops have resumed business, and there are theaters and radio stations. The people's lives are very stable. In addition, various facilities in China have become increasingly active. Township joint associations have been organized in various county towns to cooperate in maintaining security, which is deeply commendable. The Jinlan area is rich in national defense resources, such as fluorite, tung oil, and butter production, which are also very abundant. Since the Japanese army occupied that area, it has not only cut off the Chongqing side's secret transportation route and destroyed its strategic strongholds on the Shanghai side, but also because that area is a national defense resource area, it will also make a great contribution to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and so on.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Central China Occupies Jianli County - Japanese Army in Jiangxi Approaches Quantang</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army front line in Hubei, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army began operations in various parts of Central China in the middle of this month, it has made considerable progress. On the 14th, it even broke into the area south of Hubei Province and north of Yuezhou with powerful troops. For several days, it continued to attack Chen Cheng's vanguard army and the 149th Division, 445th Regiment, and other troops, totaling about 30,000 men. On the 15th, with the cooperation of the army and air force, it shattered the defensive position of the Chongqing 445th Regiment. On the 16th, at dawn, it broke into Jianli County (40 kilometers north of Yuezhou) and immediately occupied it completely. Another elite Japanese army that went south from a certain place occupied Zhangjinhe City, 40 kilometers east of Shashi, at 3:00 a.m. on the 16th. In addition, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing's ships on the river for several days. As a result, the Chongqing army was in extreme chaos due to the retreat being cut off. Moreover, a certain Japanese naval mobile unit ventured to attack directly behind the Chongqing army and landed secretly along the Yangtze River after the Chongqing 81st Division's position, giving it a great blow and occupying its command headquarters, Xinchang (63 kilometers south of Shashi). As for the four strongholds of Jianli, Xinchang, Zhangjinhe City, and Hao Xue, which have been occupied by the Japanese army, a complete encirclement has been formed, and a heroic annihilation battle is currently being waged in the swampy area south of Bailu Lake, overcoming heavy rain and muddy roads, and so on.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Front, 18th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army arrived outside the key areas of Zhoujiashan and Laohushan northwest of Gao'an on the 16th. They continued to advance and approached Quantang Chuanjia in the morning of the 17th, and are currently attacking fiercely.

<h3>Japanese Army Achieves Victory in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Su-Huai Front, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese rapid unit that advanced to the Dangshan area (80 kilometers west of Xuzhou) in northwestern Jiangsu Province began attacking the Chongqing 92nd Army, which was heading north, on the 13th. On the 14th, in the southeastern area of Maliangran (approximately 800 kilometers northwest of Dangshan), it surrounded the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 56th Division of the army and gave it a thorough blow. The battle results are as follows: 485 Chongqing soldiers were killed, and the Japanese army intercepted one mortar, six rapid-firing machine guns, thirteen Czech light machine guns, six grenade launchers, two hundred and one rifles, eighty-five hundred and fifty rounds of rifle ammunition, five hundred and fifty hand grenades, and three pistols.</p>
<p>Su-Huai Front, 18th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese troops who occupied Fenggu Village, Junqiao Town, Caodian, and other places tightened the encirclement and urgently pursued the remnants of the Chongqing 89th Army to the vicinity of Jingkou Town (8 kilometers east of Cheqiao Town) at dawn on the 18th, completely annihilating them. Moreover, after fiercely attacking the Cheqiao Town area, the main force of the Japanese army has already turned its spearhead and started new actions towards the ×× area.</p>

<h3>Southern Tunisia: Axis Forces Advance Victoriously, Striving to Control the Gulf of Gabès; Rommel's Troops Join Forces with the Main Force</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Allied Press: The Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa announced today that the Allied Forces have withdrawn from Fériana and Sbeitla, and German forces have occupied Kasserine in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Allied Press: According to news from the front lines in North Africa, Axis forces in the central Tunisian region have gradually advanced towards the Sbeitla and Gafsa border areas in recent days. It is reported that American troops in that area have been forced to retreat towards the Tunisian and Algerian border. Furthermore, American mechanized units near Sbeitla launched a fierce counterattack on the 15th after reinforcements arrived, briefly halting the Axis advance. However, due to repeated fierce attacks by Axis mechanized forces, they were completely defeated on the 16th. American troops attempting to defend the high ground north of Sidi Bou Zid also retreated on the morning of the 17th. Moreover, the anti-Axis forces headquarters announced the battle situation on the night of the 17th, stating that the American 12th Air Force had withdrawn from Sbeitla and the airfield approximately 30 kilometers southwest of the area. Currently, Axis forces are advancing in a fan-shaped formation along the Gafsa region. Axis forces advancing southwest along Gafsa have occupied numerous villages and oasis areas in the western end of the Chott el Djerid wetland area in the Neda area. On the 16th, American forces launched a counterattack against the right wing of the Axis forces in the area, but were ultimately repelled. In this battle, 35 American tanks were destroyed, and many were captured or killed. Furthermore, in southeastern Tunisia, the rearguard units of the battle of Zemel retreated skillfully, successfully joining forces with the main force of the army on the Mareth Line.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Huitong News Agency reported last night that the German and Italian forces advancing southwest from Gafsa in southern Tunisia have reached the western border of Tozeur, occupying several villages and oases from American forces. The American attack on the northern flank of the Axis forces has been repelled, with heavy American casualties and 33 tanks destroyed. Axis reconnaissance units advancing west and northwest in the area discovered an area not occupied by enemy forces and promptly occupied it.</p>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 17th, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, both sides on the Tunisian front were busy concentrating troops and improving positions. General Rommel's troops have established a strong position on the Mareth Line. British forces appear to have lost contact with the Axis forces. British forces from Libya are currently concentrating on the Ben Gardane border. General Rommel has apparently established a second strong base in Tunisia, the first being in the northern Bizerte to Tunis area. The Axis occupation of Gafsa allows them to control the area around the Gulf of Gabès. Furthermore, according to the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa, the German offensive near Faïd Pass has been repelled, but fierce fighting continues near Sbeitla. The German forces have received a large number of aircraft reinforcements, and airstrikes are more convenient since the Axis forces occupied the Gafsa airfield. German and Italian communiqués also announced that there was reconnaissance activity on the front lines, and Axis aircraft continue to bomb enemy concentration points and transport lines. American forces suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials in the battle of Gafsa, with 10,000 killed, wounded, and captured, mostly belonging to the 2nd Armored Division defending the western positions of the Faïd Pass.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Maintain Initiative, Launch Offensive in Fan-Shaped Formation</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: The initiative in the North African war currently remains in the hands of the Axis powers. The German-Italian allied forces launched operations in central Tunisia on the 14th, with two main directions of attack: one northward, advancing through Sidi Bou Zid towards Sbeitla and Kasserine; and the other southward, advancing along the border of Tozeur, threatening the city of El Guettar and the strategically important Métlaoui. Sidi Bou Zid and El Guettar have now been occupied by Axis forces. In this campaign, American forces suffered heavy losses in military supplies and prisoners, and have been forced to abandon important strategic positions. The main objectives of the Axis advance have now been achieved, and the enemy's position has been shaken, with morale among the American Fifth Army in disarray. This is the situation in western Tunisia. The British Eighth Army is currently stationed in southern Tunisia. Since suffering heavy losses in attacks on German-Italian positions along the border on February 7th and 8th, they have remained inactive, engaging only in reconnaissance. However, in order to relieve the American forces in central Tunisia, Montgomery may take action, as mere reconnaissance will not suffice.</p>
<p>General Wilson Departs for North Africa to Assume Command of the British Eighth Army</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency, London: General Wilson, who commanded the British Ninth and Tenth Armies in the Middle East, has departed from Baghdad to take up his new post in North Africa. The British government has appointed Wilson as Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army. Istanbul, 18th, Huitong News Agency: According to news from Baghdad, General Wilson issued a message to the British soldiers, anticipating a fierce battle.</p>
<h3>South of Kharkiv: German Forces Launch Counteroffensive; Soviet Reinforcements Engage in Fierce Fighting from the Sea of Azov to Orel</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Führer, 18th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that Soviet forces in western Caucasus and the mountains of Krasnodar attacked several times yesterday without success. Our troops attacked the Soviet forces southeast of Novorossiysk, forcing the enemy to retreat to the coast. Fierce fighting continued yesterday in the areas between the Sea of Azov and southeast of Oryol. German forces in the city of Kharkiv, following a pre-determined plan, destroyed important facilities and then withdrew from the area. A German armored counterattack routed a Soviet regiment south of the city. German aircraft conducted multiple bombing raids on enemy forces in the Kharkiv area. Soviet forces north of Kursk launched multiple attacks, suffering heavy losses and retreating. German forces south of Lake Ladoga repelled a strong Soviet force attacking our positions, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and destroying 38 tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Military sources here say that fierce fighting continues near Kharkiv. The temperature has risen to ten degrees Celsius, and vehicles and boots are sinking in the mud as the ground thaws. Aircraft operations are also hindered by rain and fog. Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties when attacking Kharkiv, despite dense German artillery fire. Soviet forces have redeployed troops to the Kharkiv area, and fierce fighting is also taking place between the Sea of Azov and Orel.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 18th, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, fierce fighting continued along the Eastern Front from the Caucasus to the vicinity of Orel. The battle situation in various areas is summarized as follows: (1) South of Novorossiysk, the Red Army has again increased its pressure, attempting to occupy the bridgehead on the Kuban River. Fierce fighting is ongoing. The German Air Force is actively participating, bombing enemy positions and conducting reconnaissance. (2) On the south bank of the Donets River, after abandoning Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, German forces also withdrew from the area according to a pre-determined plan. However, the Red Army had to proceed cautiously due to landmines planted by the Germans. At the same time, German rear guard forces covered the retreat of their main forces to new positions, preventing the Red Army from advancing rapidly. According to the Red Army General Staff, after occupying Slavyansk, the Red Army continues to advance towards Taganrog along the coast of the Sea of Azov. However, the Red Army General Staff has abandoned its hopes of launching a large-scale offensive. Two Red Army groups were originally dispatched to set a trap for the German forces in the Donets River basin, hoping to encircle and destroy them. One group, commanded by General Fandudin, attempted to advance from Krasnoarmeysk towards Stalino. The other group, led by General Maminovsky, attempted to advance from Lozovaya towards an important railway center southwest of the city. However, the Soviet side has admitted that these two armies will encounter "very determined resistance" in their attempt to link up in the area, suffering heavy losses in both manpower and materials with each attack. (3) The Kharkiv city area is still engulfed in flames, and the battle situation is chaotic. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has occupied Chuguev, southeast of the city, but progress along the Kharkiv-Poltava railway line is slow. (4) The area between Lower Kharkiv and Kursk is quiet. The Red Army is increasing pressure north of Kharkiv, but General Golikov's attempt to reach the Bryansk-Kursk railway has also failed. (5) There is frequent Red Army movement in the Velikiye Luki area, but no major battles have taken place. (6) Near Lake Ilmen and the vicinity of Leningrad, the Red Army has again launched an offensive, but it was repelled by German artillery fire.</p>

<h3>Portugal: Wartime Preparations; Promulgation of Industrial Mobilization Order</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Central News Agency: The President of Portugal, in view of the increasingly dangerous international situation, promulgated an emergency industrial mobilization order on the 17th as a precaution.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency: The Portuguese government, in order to determine its wartime preparedness, yesterday ordered that all national agencies, private enterprises, and public utilities be placed under military organization. All factories in wartime industries, postal services, telegraphs, wireless communications, transportation, mining, power plants, liquid fuel depots, overseas and inland navigation, port facilities, chemical industries, and food supply are all included in the "military organization". Those engaged in the work of the "military organization," regardless of their age or gender, are also within the "military organization". The Portuguese government will also employ its own nationals to replace foreign workers. All transport operations will prioritize government transport. Once there is a danger of war breaking out, the government will conduct a strict inspection of the national postal and telecommunications services. This work will be jointly carried out by military authorities or the police department together with the state department.</p>

<h3>United States Requests Expansion of "Protective Boundaries" in the Atlantic; From Iceland to the Coast of West Africa; Pucheu and British Ambassador Hold Talks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Huitong News Agency: According to British radio reporter Barkway, Washington political and press circles, in response to US Secretary of the Navy Knox's demands for bases in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, advocate that the United States establish a "protective boundary" in the Atlantic for military strategy. Some US senators believe that the United States needs to expand its "protective boundary", ranging from Iceland through the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal to the coast of West Africa. Barkway did not elaborate on other details of the "protective boundary", only stating that some politicians in Washington advocate that the bases leased by the United Kingdom to the United States should permanently belong to the United States.</p>

<h3>British Convoy Commander Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th, Havas News Agency, London: British convoy commander General Brownrigg has been killed in action at the age of sixty-two. He was the captain of a ship in the Battle of Jutland during the last European War and retired in 1938. After the outbreak of this war, he was recalled to serve as a convoy commander.</p>
<h3>Archbishop of New York Visits Rome; Entrusted with Special Mission</h3>
<p>Rome, 18th, Huitong News Agency: Vatican sources solemnly stated yesterday that the visit of Archbishop Spellman of New York to Rome has nothing to do with religious matters. Before the war, bishops and archbishops from various regions often came to Rome to report on their duties, but this custom has been abolished since the outbreak of the war. Spellman's trip has a special mission, as he is visiting American troops in North Africa and England in his capacity as the highest military chaplain of the United States. Spellman is taking this opportunity to visit Rome for a meeting with the Pope. However, Spellman has extremely close ties with Roosevelt and is very familiar with the Pope, so people generally attach great importance to Spellman's trip. It is unknown whether he is carrying a letter from Roosevelt to the Pope.</p>
<h3>Japanese Major Tominaga Delivers Broadcast: Prospects for Commerce Raiding Warfare</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: Navy Major Tominaga, a member of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters Navy Press Corps, delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, entitled "Prospects for Commerce Raiding Warfare," explaining the Axis submarine warfare and the countermeasures taken by the anti-Axis forces. The gist of the speech was that the recent activities of Axis submarines have dealt a major blow to the British government and public, and the US government is also deeply disturbed by this. The US naval authorities have frankly admitted that the US is currently at a disadvantage in the naval war. As for the attacking power of Axis submarines, their surface speed has reached as high as 20 knots. The development of high-performance special torpedoes, the advancement of torpedo launchers and precision, the emergence of sophisticated observation equipment, special performance, and new tactics such as group attacks are all sufficient to deal a death blow to enemy convoys. Therefore, the power of Axis submarines has truly shaken the enemy. By the end of last year, they had sunk 29 million tons of enemy ships. US military commentators have stated that the number of submarines built by the Axis powers actually exceeds the number they have lost. However, the current shipbuilding tonnage of the United Kingdom and the United States is less than half of the number lost. If this continues, it will be difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to maintain their offensive power. Furthermore, the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific are not only sufficient to determine the Pacific war situation, but also sufficient to prevent the US Navy from moving to the Atlantic, which contributes greatly to the activities of the Axis forces. It is now heard that the British government is expanding the Submarine Countermeasures Committee, and it is also reported that the United States and the United Kingdom seem to be discussing the establishment of a joint Submarine Countermeasures Command. However, judging from the current situation, the enemy navy in the Atlantic is finding it insufficient even to defend its sea supply routes. Although the United States and the United Kingdom are actively strengthening their escort fleets for defense, the number of their destroyers is only about 200, so it is not easy to implement a strong escort system. Compared with the Axis submarine power increasing day by day, the pain of the United States and the United Kingdom is becoming more and more profound, which is self-evident at present.</p>

<h3>The Storm in Chongqing's Banking Industry</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>Historically, the financial crises in Chongqing's banking industry have all been due to a shortage of funds, failed speculation, and even the involvement of fellow businesses. For example, the bank failures triggered by the debased half-dollar coins in 1928, the crisis of 1930, and the "Tang" branded note crisis of 1932 were all related to commercial speculation, whether it was currency exchange speculation or remittance speculation. According to those familiar with the Chongqing financial market, the recent troubles of Jiangning Bank unfolded as follows: At the time, more than ten banks in Chongqing were facing a capital shortage. After repeated clearing failures by the Chongqing Central Bank's bill exchange department, eight remained. After further settlement, only Jiangqing Bank was left, and after repeated discussions, it was ultimately unable to fill the gap and temporarily suspended operations. The Chongqing Banking Association then sent personnel to inspect the bank's accounts. It was found that the bank had external debts in Chongqing totaling more than 2.8 million yuan, and its Neijiang branch also had external debts exceeding 500,000 yuan. Subsequently, during the examination of its asset accounts, more than 1.6 million yuan was found with unclear usage. To protect depositors and stabilize finance, the "Ministry of Finance" instructed the Banking Association to seal the bank's external documents and telegraphed the Chongqing Municipal Social Bureau, ordering the bank to suspend operations for fifteen days for reorganization.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, there are two noteworthy points about this financial crisis. First, it is clear that Jiangqing Bank was not the only one experiencing a capital shortage due to tight credit. Although this phenomenon was not yet widespread, the fact that more than ten banks were affected, accounting for a quarter of the total in Chongqing, is not a small number. Second, was Jiangqing Bank's declaration of liquidation due to the manager's extravagance and gambling, leading to deepening debt? This remains a mystery. At the same time, rumors from outside, based on speculation, vary. Some say it was failed speculation, others say it was frozen capital, and still others say that some funds were moved out, making it impossible to adjust temporarily. Since those involved have not announced anything, I believe all of these are possible. About 70-80% of Jiangqing Bank's shareholders are sugar merchants from Neijiang. Currently, the highest interest rates in Sichuan are in Neijiang and Zigong. The interest rate had risen to 8% per month some time ago, and it has been fluctuating around 8% for months. With the autumn harvest, the practice of hoarding grain in the countryside has resurfaced. At the same time, rising sugar prices have further stimulated the desire of sugar merchants to hoard and speculate. Therefore, it is not unfounded to say that funds have been moved out or frozen. Naturally, we cannot deny the manager's poor management skills or even the use of the bank's funds as gambling stakes, but it is difficult to regard them as the decisive factor in this crisis. In short, regardless of the root cause of the Jiangqing Bank crisis, the fact that the bank diverted depositors' funds for improper purposes (whether it was gambling or speculative hoarding) is a common understanding of this crisis. At the same time, the inability to repay the debts of over 3 million yuan in a timely manner, causing some fellow businesses to be affected, is also an undeniable fact. We certainly cannot exaggerate based on these two points and say that Chongqing's financial market will gradually develop into a larger crisis starting with Jiangqing Bank. However, we can say that it is the beginning of the exposure of vulnerabilities in Chongqing's banking industry without the slightest exaggeration. To what extent will this vulnerability develop? What form will it take to end or evolve? These are all difficult to predict. We can say it will be good, or we can say it will be bad. In short, whether it is good or bad depends on how the key to financial control is grasped, which can be asserted. The weakness of Chongqing's banking industry is a common sentiment among those who know the bottom line of Chongqing's financial market. Now, I will briefly discuss the banks.</p>
<p>The formation of Chongqing banks generally takes one of the following three forms: One is to raise funds first to establish a bank, using the bank to absorb foreign capital or facilitate funds between fellow businesses, as a basis for operating secondary businesses; another is to start with several different companies as a foundation, and everyone organizes by pooling shares under a common goal—to enrich the funds of their own industry; and the third is that companies in the same industry (such as cotton yarn merchants, cloth merchants, paper merchants, etc.) organize by pooling funds to facilitate the financial activities of their industry. The first and last forms were more popular before the war, while the second form was the most popular during the war. Occasionally, the first form was also used to absorb foreign capital. Regardless of which form of formation is adopted, the purpose of general bank organization is not to regulate finance and solve problems that banks have not solved, but to use banks as the hub for operating secondary businesses. Some say that secondary businesses are the machines of bank operators, and banks are the lubricating oil for these machines. If banks exist, then these machines, after being lubricated, can produce more things, and the circulation of capital will be greater. I think this analogy is the most appropriate to describe the relationship between banks and their secondary businesses.</p>
<p>Most banks focus on short-term deposits and loans as their business center. Precisely because they are short-term deposits and loans, those who operate banks cannot use them to operate relatively long-term secondary businesses (such as industry and mining). 70-80% of them invest in commerce, especially speculative commerce. Therefore, the foundation of banks is mostly based on commercial operations. During the war, using speculative commerce as the main investment target was more common than in peacetime. If we examine the development process of Chongqing banks in recent years, we will know the reason for the sudden rise of banks.</p>
<p>According to Kang Yongren's statistics, among the 53 banks in Chongqing, 37 were established in 1940 and 1941, with the most starting in 1941 (24 were established in 1941). Why did Chongqing banks develop so much in these two years! Judging from the situation at the time, the stimulation of war profiteering may be the reason for the sudden rise. (Omitted) Because the strange continuous rise in prices over the years has given those who seek war profiteering the best opportunity, speculative activities in society were everywhere at that time. Along with the rise of speculative activities, the banking industry also rose. I mentioned above that banks are based on speculative activities. The development of speculative activities in these two years has led to an increase in banks, which can be said to be the inevitable trend of the abnormal development of the economy. Second, the increase in interest rates and grain prices during this period caused floating capital to concentrate in cities, which is also a reason for the sudden rise of banks. During this period, interest rates have been increasing since 1940, with slight fluctuations. The average interest rate in 1940 was only 8 yuan and 54 cents, but by the second half of October 1941, the interest rate had increased to 12 yuan, 14 yuan in the first half of November, 15 yuan in the second half of November, and 17 yuan in the upper and lower periods of December. This trend of continuous increase stabilized slightly until the government limited interest rates. Precisely because interest rates increased, floating capital became more active. The sources of floating capital mainly come from the following three channels: one is the funds transferred internally, one is the temporary expenses of a semi-official nature, and the other is the deposits of local tyrants. Among them, the funds of landlords and the funds transferred internally are the main factors constituting the capital of emerging banks. Their first step is to invest in interest rates, the second step is to jointly operate speculative businesses, and the third step is to organize banks or silver firms. In recent years, according to those familiar with business conditions, there are quite a few landlords in the countryside who take capital to cities to do speculative businesses or banks. Because the first landlord only needs to sell 200 shi of grain to operate a bank alone, which is incomparable to when grain prices were low. Third, the fact that banks regard banks as the tail end and the government's lax restrictions on banks are also reasons for the flourishing of banks. Of course, the most important reasons are still the stimulation of war profiteering and the mischief of floating capital.</p>
<p>Since banks are based on speculative commerce, the possible phenomena will be the following two: The first is a crisis caused by frozen funds. Banks like this are determined to not focus their main operations on regulating finance, but on absorbing deposits to operate their own secondary businesses. Taking the situation of Chongqing banks' interest rates and deposits in 1940 and 1941 as an example, at the end of June 1940, the total amount of interest rate deposits in 39 banks in Chongqing was 19,704,000 yuan, and the loans were 19,016,000 yuan. At the end of September, the total amount of deposits was 25,790,000 yuan, and the loans were 24,516,000 yuan. At the end of December, the total amount of deposits was 36,921,000 yuan, and the total amount of loans was 36,863,000 yuan. At the end of January 1941, the total amount of deposits was 44,328,000 yuan, and the loans were 38,877,000 yuan. At the end of March, the total amount of deposits was 61,170,000 yuan, and the loans were 58,333,000 yuan. In terms of the category of loans, the total amount invested by 24 banks and silver firms in Chongqing at that time was 35,065,319.14 yuan, of which commercial loans accounted for 98.88% of the total, with a real number of 34,675,887.37 yuan. As for loans to industry and mining, it only accounted for 0.01% of the total loan amount, with a real number of 165,000 yuan. In comparison, industry and mining are pitifully inadequate. If we look at the category of investment, the total investment amount is 3,394,077.60 yuan, of which commercial investment accounts for 42.198%, with a real number of 1,432,061.97 yuan, and industry and mining investment only accounts for 1.40%, with a real number of 50,000 yuan. 24 banks invested 50,000 yuan in industry and mining, which shows how they weigh the importance of investment. The so-called investment is not actually investing outside the secondary businesses operated by the bank, but mainly in the secondary businesses operated by itself, and then extending the balance to others. This can be said to be an open secret. From this, we can draw the following conclusion: The purpose of general banks absorbing deposits is not to regulate the financial market, but to enrich the secondary businesses they operate. This is the first point. The capital constituting the secondary businesses, due to the restrictions of current or short-term deposit restrictions, and at the same time, due to the stimulation of war profiteering, the secondary businesses operated mostly embark on a speculative path. This is the second point. Operators invest a part of the deposits in their own businesses, and a part is used as credit loans and invested in other companies. However, these can all cause the funds to stagnate, even if it is a speculative business or a short-term loan. This is the third point. Capital stagnation has always been criticized by business operators. When the financial environment is relaxed and the source of deposits is abundant, the stagnation of funds is not noticeable. If the financial environment becomes tight, deposits are scarce, and at the same time, when the bank's reserve funds are not sufficient, the fluctuations that may be caused by the stagnation of funds, anyone engaged in bank operations can immediately feel its threat, and this threat may also develop into the beginning of a financial crisis. If Jiangqing Bank's current consequences were caused by frozen capital, then it can be classified into the same category. The second is market fluctuations caused by failed speculation. Originally, a business becoming a speculative act has some risk in itself. For example, at the end of 1941 and the first quarter of 1942, many people who did import trade in Hong Kong, Burma, Jinhua and other places did indeed obtain amazing war profiteering, but there were also many who failed due to the risk of war. When Lashio and Jinhua fell, didn't we hear such words: a certain bank lost several million yuan, and a certain company lost several million yuan? If such huge losses were encountered by the bank's secondary businesses, it would be impossible to fill the gap when the financial environment is tight. Similar examples may be found more than ten times in Chongqing's financial history. Some people have also discussed the Jiangqing Bank crisis in this way, believing that it may have suffered some losses in finance, resulting in the exposure of weaknesses and the inability to recover. Naturally, speculation is speculation, but this kind of speculation is not without reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, if we don't talk about reorganizing banks, then so be it. If we talk about reorganization, then we should get to the bottom of it, find out the source of the bank's risks. The so-called source of the disease should be attributed to credit loans, and especially to short-term deposits and loans. Short-term deposits and loans are the main factors that lead to hoarding and speculation. Although the Municipal Chamber of Commerce vigorously argued for some difficulties in the implementation of the short-term deposit and loan control measures this spring, harm outweighs the benefits, which is the unanimous view of today's society. Although it does not necessarily advocate the immediate abolition of short-term deposits and loans, if more effective measures can be taken, the abolition of short-term deposits and loans is also necessary. (Strictly speaking, short-term deposits and loans are purely usurious in nature.) Otherwise, gradually changing the old habits of interest rate deposits and loans and transferring the business of credit investment, with the current bill exchange system as the hub, may not be a method. This time, for the convenience of management, banks that implement short-term deposit and loan businesses should be subject to limited registration, and a certain percentage of interest rate deposits should be deposited with the national bank as a guarantee for short-term deposits and loans, so that depositors will not suffer losses due to risks. Third, in addition to implementing regular inspection systems, it is also necessary to consider merging some banks or silver firms that lack funds under the circumstances of checking the asset amount of the banks, so that the security of the financial market can be more guaranteed. Fourth, national banks should relax the restrictions on legitimate loans, so as to reduce the activity of short-term deposits and loans, because today's abnormal activity of short-term deposits and loans in the market, whether overt or covert, precisely illustrates the need for capital turnover in society. Otherwise, there is no way out for funds invested in short-term rates. Many companies or factories often reluctantly borrow this interest rate loan to regulate their funds because they feel some difficulties in borrowing from the authorities. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is by no means a fundamental solution! (Sent on January 15, 1943)</p>

<h3>Illegal Price Hikes Trigger a Price Increase Trend - Authorities Determined to Investigate and Punish Cautiously - Merchants of All Industries Should Exercise Self-Restraint - The Policy of Suppression Remains Unchanged - Banking Industry Should Immediately Stop Lending to Non-Productive Businesses</h3>
<p>Reward Whistleblowing, Investigate Transactions</p>
<p>The authorities, considering that the price increase trend of all goods has become increasingly fierce recently, and if this continues, the future is deeply worrying. Therefore, in addition to strictly implementing various established regulations, they have also formulated a reward method to encourage whistleblowing from all sectors and continue to send personnel to investigate the sales situation of various companies and commercial firms. If any of the following situations are discovered: (1) Failure to clearly mark the prices of goods, (2) Refusal to sell despite having a large inventory, (3) Adding mixed goods to reduce quality, (4) Refusal to use invoices, etc., they will be dealt with according to law to prevent goods from continuing to rise in price.</p>
<p>Sufficient Inventory, Warning Against Refusal to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries with various industry associations revealed that the inventory of various goods is still sufficient. In addition to being allocated to each cargo by the relevant authorities on a regular basis, each company and commercial firm still has an existing amount of inventory purchased automatically in the past. The authorities have a concrete grasp of the supply of goods and have ordered each industry association to establish an allocation team to plan fair allocation. Therefore, each industry association expressed regret for the limitation of sales goods by its peers and will try to stop it. Those who do not complete each cargo in accordance with the established regulations are allowed to be directly dealt with by each industry association. However, the process of violation and punishment methods must be submitted to the authorities. ) The reporter recently obtained news from various industries that recently, various companies and commercial firms have been refusing to sell goods on the pretext of not having goods on the market. For example, a certain shoe and hat store on North Henan Road posted a note on the glass window, stating "The samples in the window are not for sale, only displayed in the window. These goods are not intended to be sold at the current price." Some also marked the goods as "Purchased by Mr. So-and-so." At the same time, various companies and commercial firms have not adjusted their daily business hours. Some are open for half a day in the morning, and some only open their doors to the market after noon but close at 6 pm. The continued occurrence of this kind of situation inevitably causes anxiety. The authorities have given strict warnings and will soon correct the buying and selling time of each industry.</p>
<p>Jewelry Stores Reopen, Transactions Halt</p>
<p>Four jewelry stores in this city, including Xinfengxiang, Laofengxiang Fang Jiuxia, and Qiu Tianbao, were sealed by the Industry Bureau's Material Control Department the day before yesterday for exceeding the price limit for gold jewelry. All jewelry stores of all sizes in the city also voluntarily closed the day before yesterday. The Jewelry Industry Association sent representatives to petition the authorities, requesting a relaxation of the price limit for gold jewelry sales to maintain business operations. However, the authorities decided to strictly enforce the limit of 3,000 yuan. The four sealed jewelry stores were unsealed after paying a fine. All jewelry stores in the city complied with the order to resume business and resume listing prices, but actual transactions have completely halted.</p>
<p>Jewelry Store Association Submits Document to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Jewelry Store Association yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which reads in part, "Submitting a request for reasoned negotiation to maintain business operations. According to reports from member stores Qiu Tianbao, Fang Jiuxia, Lao Fengxiang, and Xinfengxiang Jewelry Stores, on the 16th of this month, the Industry Bureau suddenly sent personnel to seal the above four member jewelry stores and ordered them to suspend business, asking the reason for this emergency measure due to gold jewelry exceeding the price limit. The price of gold and silver has always been determined by the legal supply and demand of the market, which cannot be monopolized by member jewelry stores alone, nor can it be arbitrarily manipulated by price listings. This has been the case for over a hundred years, and there are not only commercial customs that can be investigated, but also daily newspaper records that can be verified. Since being ordered to suspend business, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers have been thrown into panic, with a profound and significant impact on society. This matter concerns the future of this industry and the welfare of workers, and it is reasonable to truthfully submit a request for prompt negotiation and legal efforts to benefit business operations and maintain commercial hardship. Sincerely, public friendship." According to the Central News Agency, the jewelry industry sent representatives again yesterday afternoon to pay respects to the authorities, requesting a change in the price limit to provide legitimate profits. The authorities stated that they need to consider this at length, but for the time being, they will still maintain the original price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. The industry also appealed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance, and Secretary-General Hu received them, expressing willingness to stand on a fair position and find a way to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Exceeding the Price Limit is Said to be Involuntary</p>
<p>According to a key member of a certain jewelry store who told a Datong News Agency reporter, the current price limit for plain gold was set on January 11, when Mr. Sheng Yudu, the general manager of the Industry Bureau, summoned representatives of the industry association and specified it in person. At that time, the price of gold bars was 27,500 yuan (per ten taels), so in terms of the price of gold at that time, the price limit for gold jewelry of 3,000 yuan per tael was very fair and reasonable. However, in less than two weeks, the off-market price of gold rose sharply. By the end of January, it had jumped to 35,000-36,000 yuan. Although the jewelry industry tried to maintain the price limit, it was difficult to endure such huge losses due to the capital involved. Therefore, on February 2, the industry association sent representatives to the Industry Bureau to request that an increase in the price limit for gold jewelry be filed for record, but this was not approved.</p>
<p>Huge Fines Have Been Submitted</p>
<p>Afterwards, some peers, due to maintaining capital, moderately raised prices. The Industry Bureau authorities believed that since the bureau had not approved the request for filing for record, the industry's unauthorized increase in prices was naturally inappropriate, and therefore imposed a severe penalty of sealing. Afterwards, after the association sent representatives to request the Industry Bureau, they were granted permission to change to paying a fine of 408,200 yuan and were allowed to unseal. This huge fine was jointly paid by the four sealed jewelry stores on the 17th.</p>
<p>Increasing the Price Limit Has Not Been Considered</p>
<p>As for whether the Industry Bureau authorities will consider the Jewelry Industry Association's request to increase the price limit for gold jewelry, as of now, nothing is known. Therefore, whether the jewelry industry can obtain results is still a question. According to investigations, in addition to the twelve stores in the Greater Business Association and the eleven stores in the New Business Association in the two concessions, there are also about sixty or seventy stores in the Small Business Association. The store numbers of the Greater Business Association and the New Business Association are listed below (Greater Business Association): Xinfengxiang, Qingyun, Laofengxiang, Qingyun Shengji, Jingfu, Qiu Tianbao Liji, Qiu Tianbao Deji, Bao Cheng Gongji, Fang Jiuxia, Fei Wenyuan, Yang Qinghe Faji, Fengxiang Heji, (New Business Association) Lao Bao Cheng, Qinghua, Lao Feng Bao, Lao Xiang He, Yu Yongfu, Baoqing, Juxing, Zhen He Yuan Kang, Lao Bao Xing, Wuhua.</p>
<h3>General Manager of the Industry Bureau Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, the general manager of the Industry Bureau, issued a statement yesterday on the issue of suppressing the rising price trend, saying, "To suppress the sharp rise in prices, we should investigate the causes and consider both the material and currency aspects. However, the merchants' self-restraint and the public's cooperation with the authorities are extremely important to the solution of this problem. Based on the above reasons, the authorities have been cautious in implementing oppressive suppression measures, hoping that merchants can exercise self-restraint and self-examination. However, the authorities' tolerant attitude has given some unscrupulous merchants and those who dare to violate the regulations the opportunity to illegally profit, which is truly regrettable. The number of such unscrupulous merchants is increasing, and therefore, the authorities have to implement severe penalties for those who violate the regulations. The recent imposition of huge fines on large jewelry stores is one example. This measure will also be extended to those who violate the Bureau's regulations on gauze and other controlled goods.</p>
<p>The above measures show the authorities' determination to severely punish those who violate the regulations and do not change the original suppression policy. As for banks, they should immediately stop lending to non-productive businesses. This lending should be limited to productive businesses, which is also what we hope for.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Stores and Gauze Shops Violating Price Limits are Fined</h3>
<p>The Industry Bureau's Information Office announced, "Regarding the suppression of the rising price trend, the Bureau's General Manager Association has issued a statement, which is detailed in today's newspapers. The four jewelry stores that have been fined for violating the regulations are listed below:</p>
<h3>Stock Brokers</h3>
<p>In addition, there are two stock companies suspected of violating the provisions of Announcement No. 9965 issued by the Bureau on June 25 of last year. They have been sealed for investigation. The company names and locations are listed below:</p>
<p>1. China Stock Company, No. 316 Jiangxi Road</p>
<p>2. Yongchang, Room 245, Securities Exchange No. 429 Jiangxi Road</p>
<h3>North Railway Station Improves Entrance Order</h3>
<p>The authorities have restricted the passage through the main entrance of the North Station in this city, causing general passengers to be quite mixed up when boarding the train. To alleviate this congestion, it is decided that starting from the 20th, in addition to the soldiers, military dependents, Chinese and Japanese dignitaries, and foreign envoys who are allowed to pass through the main entrance, Japanese people and Chinese and foreigners holding second-class or higher tickets will also be allowed to pass through. That is, Chinese and foreigners holding third-class tickets may also enter through the main entrance if they do not carry luggage. The only people who need to pass through the side entrance are Chinese and foreigners carrying luggage. In addition, regarding the purchase of second-class or higher tickets, it is hoped that they will be purchased from the East Asia Travel Agency before boarding the train.</p>
<p>Reader's Forum</p>
<h3>French Concession Population Movement Problem</h3>
<p>— Min Zhi</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Baojia system in the concessions, the results have been quite good, especially in terms of public security, which makes people feel at ease. However, things are never as ideal as one might hope. For example, the French Concession recently issued a notice stating that the population movement issue will no longer be handled through Baojia coordination, but will be the individual's own responsibility. Therefore, all procedures, including "obtaining movement permits," "submitting movement permits," "applying for identification cards," and "receiving identification cards," will be conducted centrally. Those who understand the ideals behind this will think that centralizing everything reduces difficulties, but this actually makes life harder for the common people. Taking the central district as an example, there are almost fifty or sixty Baojia. If each Baojia has fifty or sixty people moving each day, then the central district will have two or three thousand people waiting to handle these matters every day. The daily office hours are only eight hours, and if each hour handles sixty people, then only five hundred people can complete the process each day. There are still one or two thousand people just standing idly for a whole day. Therefore, those who are weaker may not even be able to enter the building for several days. After three days, a fine of fifty yuan will be imposed. Wouldn't that be unjust?</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, it would be better to continue to have the Baojia coordinate matters, in order to maintain the true meaning of division of labor and cooperation. If there is concern that people will waste movement permits, the Baojia can sell them, which would avoid crowding and wasted time. If it is believed that the Baojia are not diligent enough in handling matters and that the district office must still be responsible, then I think the process could be divided into different queues for different items, such as "submitting movement permits," "collecting movement permits," and "applying for identification cards," each with its own staff. This would both speed up the work and increase the number of staff, so that people would not be delayed or neglect their work.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Consular Police Chiefs Conference, Odd Discussions Regarding the Abolition of Extraterritoriality and the Return of Concessions, Future Police Administration to Undergo Review and Adjustment</h3>
<p>The Japanese Embassy in Shanghai held a consular conference in late January, followed by a conference of administrative officers in early February. At 9:00 AM on the 18th, another conference of consular police chiefs from Central and Southern China was held at the YMCA on North Sichuan Road in the city. Those in attendance included the Director of the Administrative Affairs Section of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Minister Tajiri of the Embassy, Director Yano of the Administrative Affairs Department, Director Watanabe of the Police Affairs Department, and forty-two chiefs of various bureaus and offices. After formal greetings, the instructions of Greater East Asia Minister Aoki were read, followed by a speech by Minister Tajiri, who encouraged all police officers to work diligently and cooperate in building the new China. Director Yano of the Administrative Affairs Department then spoke on the significance of the reform of local police administrative organs after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry. Afterwards, Director Shiragami of the Shanghai Office gave a reply on behalf of the bureau chiefs from various locations. Finally, opinions were exchanged on the operational policy of police administration, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. The first day of the conference thus concluded. The conference will continue today (the 19th) to examine in detail the adjustment of police administration arising from the future abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Soybeans Arrived in Shanghai, Distribution Begins</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of Miscellaneous Grain Trade Associations was ordered to distribute soybeans. Several thousand bags of soybeans transported from Xuzhou have now arrived in Shanghai, and distribution procedures will begin immediately. The association stipulates that miscellaneous grain and raw goods retailers, sauce gardens, distilleries, tofu shops, roasted goods shops, soy product shops, soy milk stalls, and bean sprout and vegetable businesses can all apply to the office for registration to receive soybeans. The price is set at 48.50 military yuan per city dan (equivalent to 100 city catties). However, miscellaneous grain and raw goods retailers are only allowed to sell raw goods to the public. In addition to the officially stipulated price, retail stores are allowed to increase the price by one military yuan per city dan. Other designated stores, such as sauce gardens and distilleries, purchase the goods separately and then sell them to the public as cooked goods, but are not allowed to enjoy the right to increase the official price by one military yuan per city dan.</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Noodle Industry Resolves to Petition for Three Points, Requesting Two Ounces of Flour per Flour Ration Card for Noodle Use</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Trade Association held a general membership meeting at its headquarters on Wuyuan Street in the Nanshi yesterday. More than two hundred members attended. Chairman Wang Fuxin reported on the details of the previous dispatch of representatives to the authorities to request the resumption of flour allocation, and stated that the authorities had already agreed to allow the cooked noodle group to use flour and distribute it to the noodle industry for trading. A contract has already been signed. Next, all members resolved to continue to petition the Bureau of Industry, with the following three requests: (1) Request that two ounces of flour per ration card be allocated for noodle use for the more than 2.1 million households, with noodle shops issuing the noodles upon presentation of the ration cards. (2) Some members had already used a portion of the flour allocated to the noodle shops at the end of last year for their own food due to business closures. The amount is about one or two bags. They requested that the authorities lift the ban on using this flour in order to maintain their livelihoods. (3) Continue to send representatives to the public association to request an early resolution.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Collection Results</h3>
<p>Under the supervision of Qiu Fangmo, Director of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, the collection of various types of income tax in the first, second, and third categories has been actively promoted and resumed. In addition to establishing collection bureaus in various counties and cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Nantong, and Jiaxing, the number of collection offices was also increased in the spring of last year after considering the actual conditions of each district bureau, and tax administration was vigorously promoted. Therefore, tax revenue has increased sharply in recent years. According to statistics, from May to the end of December last year, the collection bureaus in eleven districts, including the Shanghai district, collected a total of 16,734,670 national yuan in various income taxes. The first category of income tax from profit-making enterprises declared and paid by Sino-Japanese joint ventures amounted to 251,268 Japanese gold yen. Among the eleven districts, the Nanjing district collection bureau had the highest tax revenue, accounting for 8,836,178 yuan.</p>
<h3>Operating Rates of Various Industries in the City, Flour Milling, Tobacco, and Brewing All at 100%</h3>
<p>According to a survey by a Shanghai News Agency reporter, the current operating rates of various industries in the city are not significantly different from last month. The details are as follows: Dyeing industry 30%, textile industry 60-70%, machinery industry 30% (miscellaneous work 50%), metal industry shrinking, chemical industry below 80%, kiln industry 50%, electrical machinery industry around 60%, printing industry 80%, brewing industry 100%, flour milling industry 100%, oil industry 50%, rubber industry varying from 50-60%, tobacco industry 100%, leather industry 40-50%, miscellaneous industries 50%.</p>
<h3>Assist in Anti-Spitting Campaign, Form Drama Propaganda Team</h3>
<p>In order to assist the Public Concession Health Department in promoting the second anti-spitting campaign, the China Animated Film Association has been sending out performance teams to various locations to perform animated films, in order to promote public awareness. It is reported that the names of the films include "Lung Disease" and "Superstition."</p>
<h3>Various Banks in the City Open Branches Inland, Jin Cheng Suzhou Branch Changed to Sub-Branch, Li Min Opens Branch in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Recently, various banks have noted that industry and commerce in the interior are on the path to recovery and prosperity. In order to regulate finance and support the development of industry and commerce, they have been actively restoring branch offices in the interior. In addition to the gradual resumption of business by the domestic branch offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank has changed its Suzhou office to a sub-branch, scheduled to reopen on May 1. In addition to establishing a branch in Suzhou, the Li Min Bank is also establishing a branch in Changzhou, which opened on the 17th of this month. At the same time, various banks and money shops in the city have decided to grant loans to agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises in the provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as appropriate and to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Transportation Authorities Adopt Public Opinion - Improve Order at North Station Entrance -</h3>
<p>In the past month, this newspaper has frequently received letters from readers reporting that the order at the entrance of the North Station is chaotic, causing suffering for travelers. We have selectively disclosed this. At the same time, we have presented a special article, proposing that transportation should prioritize "convenience first" and serve travelers. We earnestly request the transportation authorities to consider improvements. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency today, the authorities have decided that starting from the 20th, all passengers holding second-class and third-class tickets who are not carrying luggage will be allowed to enter from the main entrance. The crowded conditions at the entrance and the various inappropriate incidents caused by the crowding should gradually decrease. This move by the transportation authorities to seek convenience for travelers is admirable. Furthermore, the ability to value public opinion and adopt the will of the people is even more commendable. However, we still have further expectations. The North Station is the first station on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou main lines. In the past, the excellent traffic management was the best of all stations in the country. In Japan, traffic management is known worldwide for its "scientific" nature. Now that the station is under the management of the Japanese-run China Railway Company, its progress should, in theory, be even better than before. Although the facilities may be slightly simpler due to wartime damage, continuous improvement is necessary to maintain the reputation of "scientific" traffic management in Japan. This is presumably under the attention of the authorities. We sincerely hope that travelers' expectations will be met as soon as possible. At the same time, we hope that travelers will continue to report on the situation after improvements and make practical suggestions to assist the authorities in making further improvements, so as to achieve the most ideal state of "orderly."</p>
<h3>Urban Area Strengthens Public Grain Sales, Huxi Sold Flour Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen grain distribution in each district based on population and to effectively promote grain administration, the Municipal Grain Administration specially convened the Joint Office of Public Grain Sales in Nanshi and the Public Grain Sales Joint Offices of the district governments of Pudong, Zhabei, and Huxi, in the conference room of the Bureau yesterday. They discussed strengthening the direction of public grain sales in order to quickly resolve the serious threat to the food supply in the urban area.</p>
<h3>Abundant Coal Supply, No Possibility of Coal Price Increase, Illegal Merchants' Ideal of Hoarding Destroyed, Coal Catty Different from Other Goods, Should Not Increase in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chairman of the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee and Vice Chairman of the Japanese Coal Merchants Association told a reporter from the Times that the supply of coal catties in Shanghai this year will become more abundant. Illegal merchants everywhere who attempt to hoard coal by various methods to realize their ideal of increasing prices will be thoroughly destroyed by the Seacoal Merchants Association with the assistance of the authorities.</p>
<p>Prevent Coal Merchants' Illegal Transactions</p>
<p>According to him, the transaction of coal catties in Shanghai has undergone a clear change in 1942. However, in the past three weeks, a small number of merchants still wanted to include coal in other goods with increased prices. The authorities have been closely monitoring these attempts. As a result, a very small number of illegal coal merchants who sell goods at black market prices have been prevented.</p>
<p>Authorities Supervise Coal Affairs</p>
<p>Investigators from the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee are now implementing a large-scale investigation, and all affairs related to coal in the city are being supervised. General illegal transactions are being eliminated. Furthermore, due to the cooperation between the two committees and the authorities, coal catties have obviously become different from other goods.</p>
<p>No Need to Fear, Coal Prices Will Not Rise</p>
<p>He revealed that the current coal inventory is extremely sufficient and can meet long-term needs. The policies of the Coal Merchants Association will definitely not cause the inventory to decrease. He said that the Shanghai public does not need to fear that coal prices will also rise along with other goods. The Japanese coal importers association, the Bureau of Industry Coal Control Committee, and other authorities have close cooperation to prevent any possibility of coal price increases. Although we cannot predict changes in the environment, according to the opinions of the two cooperating committees and other authorities, there is no reason for coal prices to rise.</p>
<p>The Huxi District began selling household flour yesterday (the 18th). The amount of flour this time increased by four ounces compared to the previous time, to one and a half catties per person. The price is 3.3 yuan. It is reported that this sale is limited to one day, because grain will be distributed based on population within the day.</p>
<h3>Oil and Sugar Rationing Based on Population is Nearing Reality, Reportedly Handled by the Control Office</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of oil and sugar rationing based on population, it has been learned from informal sources that the Bureau of Industry Materials Control Office will open a separate department to be responsible for handling the matter in order to ensure the smooth progress of this system. The rationing procedures will be roughly the same as those for household rice flour. At the same time, it is also reported that the Ministry of Control will recruit 28 staff members to handle this matter. The date of implementation is roughly next month.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Market Prices Soar, Authorities Have Paid Attention</h3>
<p>Since the prices of goods in the city's vegetable markets began to rise one after another at the end of the old lunar year, they have not stopped to this day. According to reporters, the prices of vegetables, meat, fresh eggs, fish, etc. in various vegetable markets have all risen to the highest peak. Among them, fresh meat has increased the most. Although the authorities have set price limits, due to the manipulation of brokers, retailers are still unable to suppress prices. Moreover, due to the authorities' implementation of investigations, there has been a shortage of goods in the vegetable markets. It is learned that the authorities have paid close attention to transportation merchants and brokers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ship Loaded with Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Fulfilling Food Needs of Shanghai Citizens, Another Ship Loaded with Rice Transported North</h3>
<p>The transportation of Vietnamese rice to Shanghai has recently been quite smooth. Some time ago, the East Asia Shipping Company's ×× Maru transported Vietnamese rice to Shanghai to meet the food needs of Shanghai citizens. On the 18th, two more ships, the ×× Maru and ×× Maru, also from the East Asia Shipping Company, arrived in port with Vietnamese rice. The rice loaded on one of the ships will be unloaded in Shanghai and then transported to North China by land. The rice loaded on the other ship will all be used to meet the food needs of Shanghai citizens. The import of Vietnamese rice is now on the right track, and it is expected to continue to be imported smoothly in the future. Therefore, the food panic in Shanghai has now completely disappeared.</p>
<h3>Price Changes in the Cleared Area in January, Announced by the Political Work Group of the Clearing Branch</h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities in January of this year showed drastic changes compared to December of last year. For example, the price of rice in the Huxi District was 882 yuan per dan in December and 1135 yuan in January, a sudden increase of more than 250 yuan, 2.7 times higher than when clearing began. Flour was also 1.4 times higher, and other supplies also increased. In the sealed area, in addition to goods transported from Shanghai also increasing by 10% to 30%, local food products actually fell compared to last month. This situation is presumably related to the authorities' prohibition of food movement and the fact that it was around the lunar New Year. The investigation and statistics compiled by the Political Work Group of the Shanghai Clearing Branch are recorded below:</p>
<p>Huxi</p>
<p>White japonica rice 1135 yuan per stone, white glutinous rice 1140 yuan, flour 6.5 yuan per catty, Chinese cabbage 1.45 yuan, pork 16 yuan, goose eggs 2 yuan each, soybean oil 20 yuan per catty, soy sauce 3 yuan, salt 1.9 yuan, sugar 11.25 yuan, rice straw 25 yuan per dan, Front Door cigarettes 2.8 yuan per box, cotton 17.5 yuan per catty, local cloth 4.4 yuan per foot, foreign candles 18 yuan per pack.</p>
<p>Zhoupu</p>

<h3>Affaire of Passion Murder at the Great New Amusement Park, Police Cooperate to Solve the Case, Perpetrator Jiang Shiming Apprehended, Mistress Finds New Love and Suffers Tragic Death, Fugitive Tracked Down in Guerrilla Area and Finally Arrested</h3>
<p>A bizarre murder case occurred in the Great New Company Amusement Park on Nanjing Road at 8:00 PM on the 8th of this month. The victim was Lin Di, a former waitress in the park, aged 23. She had been stabbed in the neck, shoulder, and back. Although the surrounding area was immediately sealed off after the incident, the murderer had already escaped without a trace. After the incident became known to the Police Headquarters, it ordered its subordinates to cooperate and solve the case as soon as possible. Over the past ten days, detectives have been dispatched everywhere. Under the supervision of Sergeant of the Old Gate Police Station, Detective Tang Jian, and Japanese Detective Ito, it was finally discovered that the murderer's name was Jiang Shiming and that he was hiding in the Chuansha Township area of Pudong. Thereupon, detectives Tang and Ito, together with many other Chinese detectives, obtained the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police and went to the address to make the arrest. Unexpectedly, the perpetrator had already moved to Beihang Town in the guerrilla area. The detectives continued to Beihang despite the danger and finally arrested the principal offender and returned him to Shanghai for trial. It was found that Jiang Shiming was 32 years old, a native of Pudong, and had been a Tanhuang actor. He met Lin Di, but because Lin Di had found another lover, he was consumed by jealousy and committed murder. After being arrested, he confessed to the murder without hesitation. He is scheduled to be handed over to the court for interrogation this morning. From the occurrence of this case to today, ten days, the police authorities have been able to capture the murderer at such speed, which shows that General Inspector Watanabe, Deputy General Inspector Gojima, and Chief of the Criminal Division Kobayashi are effectively in command, and the loyalty and dedication of all the detectives are especially commendable.</p>
<h3>Sublet Housing Management Office Urges Sublessors to Obtain Licenses</h3>
<p>The Sublet Housing Management Office has begun issuing sublet licenses for the first half of this year. Many sublessors in the Public Concession and the French Concession have already gone to claim them. However, according to reporters, the total number of licenses issued this year has not only not increased, but is also less than last year. This clearly indicates that there are those who are evading the Sublet Housing Regulations. Therefore, investigations have been launched. The investigations include the following points: (1) Based on the Baojia household registration book, investigate whether there are any attached households. (2) Send personnel to various districts for on-site investigations. (3) Compare with the sublet housing registration book from last year to verify whether there is any evasion by sublessors.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper, on Behalf of All Sectors of Society, Thanks the Proctors for Their Enthusiasm; Confucian Statue and Pottery Vases Are Commissioned as Gifts; Expenses Are Borne by This Newspaper and Do Not Draw on the Subsidy Fund</h3>
<p>The student aid for over 1,600 students approved by the Fourth Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund has already been distributed in installments, and the re-approved list of students has also been finalized and announced. To thank the men and women from the Youth Association for their hard work in overseeing this year's examination affairs, this newspaper has specifically commissioned dozens of Confucian statues and pottery vases to be presented to the proctors, as a token of our appreciation. These expenses are borne by this newspaper and will not draw on any of the student aid funds.</p>
<p>Letters of Accusation – Please Provide Names</p>
<p>We recently received anonymous letters reporting on three students among those who received student aid, stating that their family circumstances are not deserving. This newspaper is conducting a confidential investigation into the circumstances of these three students, to ensure that the student aid funds are not wasted. As our colleagues' eyes and ears are not everywhere, we rely on the assistance of all sectors of society. However, the letters are mostly anonymous and without addresses, which is regrettable. This newspaper can investigate the students who received aid at any time, but will only ask about the facts and will not announce the names of the accusers. We ask that the writers of these letters pay special attention to this point.</p>
<p>Collected Works of Shi Qing – Sold for 600 Yuan</p>
<p>In addition to generously donating 500 yuan the other day, Mr. Qian Wenxuan Shiqing of Guangde also entrusted us to sell ten copies of the Complete Works of Shiqing on his behalf to aid students. After it was announced in yesterday's newspaper, people from all walks of life, who have long admired Mr. Qian's articles and virtues, bought out all the copies that day, raising 600 yuan, which has been deposited into the aid fund. This shows the value of famous works, which move society. It is admirable that people from all walks of life who bought this great work also fulfilled their wish to help students. We are deeply sorry to those who came later and were disappointed.</p>
<h3>Aid Money Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Mingde donated 1,000 yuan, Mr. Zhou (anonymous) donated 1,000 yuan, including 200 yuan from the New Year's gift money of his son, and 300 yuan from the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends for his daughter's first month.

<h3>Interest Rates on Deposits in the Banking Industry Will Be Increased to the Highest Limit; Fixed Deposits Will Range from 5% to 10%; Loans Will Be Investigated to Stabilize Finance</h3>
<p>The financial situation in this port has exhibited an abnormal development since the outbreak of the war, especially in the past year. There is an overabundance of idle capital and stagnant production. In general, those with capital are either directly hoarding daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, oil, sugar, and grains, or indirectly engaging in mortgage lending, which exacerbates the evil practice of hoarding for speculation. As a result, prices are soaring, and the people's livelihood is in dire straits. According to a reporter's investigation from relevant sources, the relevant authorities, both Chinese and Japanese, are seeking to reform and adjust the economic structure of this port to suppress prices, maintain savings certificates, increase production, and resolve people's livelihood issues. They have decided to increase deposit interest rates as much as possible to provide a reasonable outlet for idle capital. It is reported that the first steps will be: (1) to withdraw investments in unproductive areas; (2) to investigate whether the funds loaned out by banks and money shops are being used for hoarding; (3) to expand the local financial network and develop production. The above first step will be promoted by the authorities through persuasion. If it is still ineffective, the strictest countermeasures will be taken. As for raising deposit interest rates, the authorities will stipulate that the deposit interest rates of banks and money shops will be raised to the following maximum limits: (1) Ordinary deposits: 1% to 5%; (2) Fixed deposits: 5% to 10%.</p>
<p>Special Compilation on Various Places in Nanyang - Part 3 (Part 1)</p>
<h3>The Philippines: Past and Present</h3>
<p>— By A Voter</p>
<p>Historical Review</p>
<p>On September 20, 1519, Magellan's expedition, setting out from the Atlantic to the newly discovered Pacific sea route, completed the first circumnavigation of the world. The Spaniards obtained archipelagoes on the coast of the Chinese Sea (i.e., the South China Sea), which are the Philippine Islands. This was more than 400 years ago. Before this, the Philippine Islands had already had close contact with the Chinese, because they were not only located in the South China Sea, but also very close to our country. From Manila, the heart of the Philippines, to our Hong Kong, it is only 640 nautical miles. If you travel from the northernmost point of the Philippines to Taiwan, it would only take three to five days, even in ancient sailing ships. At that time, the Philippines lived a peaceful and beautiful life, and its cultural level was quite advanced. However, after the Westerners came to the East, the Philippines began its fate of oppression.</p>
<p>Magellan set off on September 20, 1519, under the order of the Spanish King, passed around South America to the Pacific Ocean, then crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Philippines. Magellan named these islands the San Lazrus Archipelago. The Spanish often called them the Isles de Poniente. Later, Magellan was killed by the residents of the Philippine Islands, and the remaining members were forced to withdraw. Therefore, although Spain declared the island as its territory at that time, it did not officially occupy it. The Portuguese, however, had already occupied the Moluccas, south of the Philippine Islands, for more than ten years. At that time, the Portuguese called the Philippine Islands the Isles de Oriente and prohibited the Spanish from invading. Later, the Spanish launched two expeditions to the Philippines, but neither succeeded (1525 and 1927). In 1529, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of Saragossa, which stipulated that the meridian 207 miles east of the Moluccas was the boundary. The western area belonged to Portugal, and the eastern area belonged to Spain, and the Philippines was located west of the boundary. In 1542, Spain decided to occupy the Philippines and sent another expedition. To commemorate the Spanish prince Philip II, it abolished the name San Lazrus and renamed it the Philippines. However, at that time, the residents of the Philippine Islands constantly resisted foreign invaders, and the Spanish expedition was forced to flee. When Philip II ascended the throne, he launched another large-scale expedition in 1564. On the one hand, he carried out diplomatic work targeting the fact that the residents of the Philippine Islands had no national organization and there were internal conflicts of interest between various tribes. From 1570 to 1571, he continued to send reinforcements and finally occupied the entire island. On the one hand, he repaired streets, built forts, and built barracks. On the other hand, he began to implement colonial politics there, in addition to the monopoly trade engaged in by the Portuguese, and brought the feudal relationship of his own country, using slave labor to carry out planting and mining.</p>
<p>However, the Spanish who moved to the Philippine Islands were only a few pirates, merchants, priests, and politicians. They came for their own selfish interests, only knowing how to enslave the residents and engage in the exploitation and plunder of labor, treasures, etc. They neither knew how to improve the culture and political standards of the natives, nor how to help them establish a new country, let alone open up a path to "human life" for the residents. During the 300 years of Spanish rule in the Philippine Islands, all the land in the Philippine Islands belonged to Spanish soldiers and priests, and the Filipinos became serfs. These slaves had no future except to be exploited to death. Therefore, for 300 years, there were constant national resistance movements. As a result, the emerging American imperialism took advantage of this and, after annexing Hawaii in 1898, immediately launched the Spanish-American War to seize the Philippines. As a result, Spain had to withdraw from the largest colony in the East, which it had ravaged for 300 years, and the United States began its colonial management of the Philippines.</p>
<p>In 1898 (the 24th year of the Qing Dynasty), the United States replaced Spain as the ruler of the Philippine Islands during the Spanish-American War. At that time, the United States' biggest goal in managing the Philippine Islands was to use it as a base for American trade with Asia. The history of the economic development of the United States proves that American capitalism had completed its domestic development work on the eve of the 20th century. At that time, it experienced the panic of overproduction, and its economic structure gradually increased its impulse to expand overseas due to reaching the advanced stage of capitalism. Although the United States had already obtained a small amount of profit in trade with China, this new imperialism was not satisfied. It also hoped to take the acquisition of the vast market of the entire East Asia as its target. Around 1900, the United States moved along the coast of the Gulf of California to Central America, and then further expanded its power to Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. Under the principle of using military force as its economic backing, the Philippines became the only military and economic base for American imperialism's invasion of East Asia.</p>
<p>The rulers of the United States in the Philippine Islands once said: "If we lose the Philippine base, then the United States' right to speak in the Pacific will inevitably be restricted. At that time, the United States' strategic base will have to retreat to Hawaii. The Philippine Islands make the United States and Japan and China directly adjacent East Asian countries, which is also the vanguard of maintaining the United States' trade rights in Asia." These words illustrate the imperialist heart of the United States towards the Philippines.</p>
<p>Geographical Situation</p>
<p>The Philippines is located in the northeastern part of the Nanyang Islands, approximately between 4 degrees 40 minutes and 21 degrees 10 minutes north latitude, and 116 degrees 40 minutes and 126 degrees 34 minutes east longitude. It faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, the South China Sea to the west, the Celebes Island and Borneo to the south, and the island of Taiwan to the north. The total number of islands is about 7,083. Luzon and Mindanao (or Mindanao) account for two-thirds of the total area of the Philippines. There are more than 400 islands with an area of more than three square kilometers, and the rest are small islands with almost no residents. The total area is about 296,294 square kilometers.</p>
<p>The area of the main islands is as follows:</p>
<p>Island Name Area (unit: one square kilometer)</p>
<p>Luzon 105.708</p>
<p>Mindanao 95.587</p>
<p>Samar 13.271</p>
<p>Negros 12.699</p>
<p>Palawan 11.655</p>
<p>Panay 11.520</p>
<p>Mindoro 9.826</p>
<p>Leyte 7.249</p>
<p>Cebu 4.390</p>
<p>Bohol 3.973</p>
<p>Masbate 3.250</p>
<p>Others 17.166</p>
<p>Total 296.294</p>
<p>Topographically, the Philippines is a group of volcanic islands along the Pacific coast. Mountain ranges run from north to south, the islands are irregularly shaped, and the terrain is rugged. There are 30 famous volcanoes in the Philippines. The hillsides have fertile volcanic soil. The islanders build dikes to form rice terraces. The rivers are short and rapid, which is conducive to irrigation but not to navigation. There are not many plains, and those that exist are small.</p>
<p>The Philippines is located in the southeastern sea of Asia and entirely belongs to the tropical zone. Fortunately, the sea breeze regulates the climate, which is still considered mild, and there is abundant rainfall. From June to November, the southwest wind blows, and it rains almost every day. December to May is the dry season, which is relatively dry. Typhoons often pass through in autumn, carrying heavy rains that often bring alarming disasters. Moreover, although the climate is good, people and livestock are often harmed by various tropical diseases. Smallpox, plague, cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria, and dysentery have all become the great enemies that the residents of the Philippine Islands must resist at all times. In addition, livestock often suffer from cattle and sheep diseases.</p>
<p>According to the latest survey on January 1, 1939, the population of the Philippine Islands was 15,984,247, with a population density of approximately 53.95 people per square kilometer. Compared to 1898, when the United States acquired sovereignty over the Philippine Islands, the population has increased by approximately 9 million. The current population includes 600,000 "pagans" with low cultural levels living in the mountain islands, and 400,000 to 500,000 Muslims living in Mindanao and Sulu. Most of the other natives are Malays, while overseas Chinese and people of mixed Chinese and Spanish descent account for the next largest number, accounting for 8% to 10%. The rest are Japanese and Europeans and Americans. The Malays have long been influenced by Western culture, especially by American religion and culture. Their knowledge has gradually increased, and their cultural level is higher than that of Malays in other places. They have democratic, social, and communist organizations established jointly with overseas Chinese. In recent decades, they have been constantly fighting with American imperialism for independence. According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in 1934, the number of overseas Chinese was 88,400 from Fujian and 22,100 from Guangdong, totaling 111,000. The Chinese who have lived in the Philippine Islands for a long time and have been Filipinized and mixed with the Spanish have not been included in the statistics. Overseas Chinese have at least a history of more than 400 years in the Philippine Islands, dating back to the year when Magellan arrived in the Philippines. They have worked hard and have become their second hometown. They get along well with the local ethnic groups. Moreover, due to their characteristics of being law-abiding, diligent, and thrifty, they have long established an unshakable foundation in the economy.</p>
<h3>"Five-Day Fever" Already Has a Specific Drug</h3>
<p>"Five-day fever," also known as "Volhynia fever," can be cured with Atabrine and Piasmosin. "Volhynia fever" is a relapsing fever transmitted by body lice. The causative agent is believed to be "Rickettsia." The fever lasts for about one to several days, and recurs after the fever subsides, and can continue to recur many times. The condition is quite similar to malaria and influenza. A Berlin dispatch on February 8, 1943, stated that the head of a German military hospital in a certain area on the Eastern Front, "Mellendo," recently treated "Volhynia fever." The original text has been published in the German Medical Weekly. The main points are excerpted below. This disease is not easy to diagnose in the early stages, because there are many similar symptoms. It can only be clearly distinguished after a long period of time. The chills and fever are more severe in the early stages and can last for several days. The fever subsides very quickly and completely. The special symptoms are pain in the tibia, as well as headache, joint pain, sacral pain, etc. In addition, there are conjunctivitis and a special rash that occurs in the early stages. The pain is most severe during the chills and fever.</p>
<p>The interval between attacks is five days, and the duration of subsequent attacks gradually becomes shorter than before. In this way, the attacks gradually become lighter and lighter, and eventually the patient recovers completely. Although this disease is severe, the patient's general condition is not very weak. Red rashes often appear in the early stages, so it is easy to confuse with typhus, and can only be distinguished later.</p>
<p>Because the causative agent of this disease is "Rickettsia," Mellendo used "Atabrine" and "Piasmosin" to treat it. These two drugs were originally specific for malaria. Mellendo used them to treat a total of 60 cases, and the results were undeniably excellent. In most cases, after taking these drugs (for seven days), the patient recovered completely and did not relapse. In addition, all pain disappeared immediately after treatment.</p>
<p>Mellendo expressed great satisfaction with the special effectiveness of using "Atabrine" and "Piasmosin" to treat "Volhynia fever," and said that this discovery is comparable to the invention of the artificial malaria drug "Piasmosin" during the last World War. (Guang)</p>

<h3>Economic Commentary: Premium Savings and Lottery Issuance</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, made a statement to the Shanghai press corps, in which he said the following regarding financial and monetary issues: "We are currently studying ways to improve the value of savings certificates, increase productivity, counter price increases, and stabilize people's livelihood. These four are the foundation for cultivating combat power, and the countermeasures are as follows: On the one hand, issue food warehouse certificates to purchase food from rural areas to curb the release of savings certificates; on the other hand, in order to encourage savings, provide bonuses to those who save a certain amount of money. Although Japan does not have this system, China has implemented it with good results and will be actively implemented by the Central Reserve Bank; although the issuance of lottery tickets has not yet been decided, it has been implemented in Manchuria and North China, so this method can be promoted."</p>
<p>The two points that the reporter wants to comment on are premium savings and the issuance of lottery tickets. Premium savings have been in China for 30 years. It was first piloted by Xinhua Bank in Beijing (in 1914). Subsequently, the Shanghai International Savings Society, the Sino-French Savings Society, and the Industrial Bank of China followed suit. Finally, the Central Savings Society took charge of the overall situation. Although this method inevitably has the disadvantage of encouraging some people's gambling mentality, in this extraordinary era, active implementation by the Central Reserve Bank may be of assistance to wartime finance. As for the issuance of national lottery tickets, it has also been seen frequently in the history of the Republic of China, such as the issuance of prize bonds by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in 1921 and the issuance of aviation and highway construction lottery tickets since 1933. From the perspective of ordinary ethics, lottery tickets have a very strong gambling nature. The state should be trying to eliminate them, so how can it promote them and directly manage them? However, from the perspective of the abnormal psychology of people during wartime, speculation, hoarding, going to teahouses, going to clubs, and crazily trading in local cotton yarn and securities are all gambling. Although the world is not as it used to be, the poor environment is actually the cause. If the government can take advantage of the situation and re-engage in the issuance of large-scale wartime lottery tickets to absorb some of the floating capital in the market that has no place to go, it may not be a good policy that is just barely acceptable during extraordinary times. If the government can go further and effectively prohibit gambling, so that cases of murder, robbery, and embezzlement of public funds caused by gambling can be eradicated from the world, then it would be especially admirable and have immeasurable merit.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Society to Be Reorganized; Lottery Tickets to Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>According to Chinese intelligence, since the war, the authorities have drafted various plans to absorb idle capital and further increase the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. One of these is the issuance of lottery tickets. As for the agency for issuing lottery tickets, the authorities intend to use the Central Savings Society. The society was originally an external agency of the Central Bank and has been handling premium savings for many years. After the January 28th Incident, the society was placed under military control. However, the premium savings that were handled before were still carried out as usual. Currently, there are still hundreds of thousands of households participating in this savings program, most of which are concentrated in Shanghai. Recently, relevant authorities plan to remove the military control of the society in the shortest possible time and implement reorganization, and invite influential people from Shanghai's financial circles to serve as directors. After the reorganization is completed, the issuance of lottery tickets will be entrusted to it for handling.</p>
<h3>The Concession Authorities Determine to Implement Price Controls</h3>
<p>According to Chinese intelligence, the Concession authorities, in view of the general price increases since the end of last year, which have greatly affected the lives of citizens, have decided to implement the current policy of price controls. The measures taken are approximately as follows: (1) Suppressing prices should take the elimination of speculation as the primary task. In the future, black market transactions will be severely cracked down on, so that unscrupulous merchants have no room for maneuvering. (2) The established public prices for production, wholesale, and retail will be strongly maintained, and no changes will be allowed. (3) The rationing system will be expanded as soon as possible to various daily necessities in order to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Essential Goods Based on Population</h3>
<p>Opinions from the Hankou business community on reforming economic institutions:</p>
<p>The Continental News on February 18 reported that the Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry required all Japanese businesses applying to join the retail distribution association to answer the principles of Japanese economic institutions. The following is an excerpt of the opinions drafted by the representatives:</p>
<p>It is hoped that an institution will be established with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the center to adapt to the economic cooperation between China and Japan. It is hoped that a central agency will be established to unify economic institutions. It is hoped that the procurement of materials will be improved. The method is to designate a business firm in each area to be responsible for import and export surveys. Limit the excessive operation of front-line merchants. It is hoped that large-scale business firm principles will be adopted. It is hoped that the import of various machinery, materials, and raw materials required for production enterprises will be encouraged. Establish a distribution mechanism for Chinese and Japanese people. All essential goods will be rationed based on population, and public prices will be strictly observed in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. It is hoped that Chinese businessmen will understand the concept of shared survival and abandon the past self-serving business methods. Regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, those who violate economic laws and regulations will be severely punished. The above opinions are all good suggestions from Japanese businessmen. How to adopt them is another matter, but it is enough to show the concern of Japanese businessmen about prices.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Sector Strives to Establish a Financial System</h3>
<p>Among the members of the National Economic Commission, the Shanghai economic community accounts for ten members. All parties are paying attention to how the economic community of this city will cooperate with the national government's policies. It is recently heard that various Chinese banks have followed the national government's economic control measures and are voluntarily preparing to cooperate and actively assist the national government in increasing production, maintaining currency value, and suppressing prices. Since the national government's entry into the war, all parties have been rectifying and establishing a wartime economic system. The financial community is also changing its goals based on the national policies of the national government, and re-examining the business policies, investment relationships, and other aspects of financial institutions that have grown in a free market economy. The goals are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Prepare to expand the local financial network.</p>
<p>(2) Review loans for speculative purposes.</p>
<p>(3) Consolidate funds invested in non-productive sectors.</p>
<p>(4) Mobilize funds for expanding production.</p>
<p>Powerful banks have drafted a new financial system plan based on these goals, which is expected to be submitted to the national government after consultation between the Banking Association and the Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Various Banks and Firms Establish Savings Departments to Absorb Idle Capital into Productive Channels</h3>
<p>The Continental News on February 18 reported that Shanghai's banks and money houses, based on the outline of wartime economic policies, have established savings departments to attract public savings. In principle, ordinary deposits are the main focus, but fixed deposits are also accepted, so as to absorb idle capital into production and avoid idle capital being used for speculation or hoarding. The interest rates are set at 1 to 4% for ordinary deposits and 5 to 10% for fixed deposits.</p>
<h3>After the Market's Brilliance, Chinese Stocks Weakened Slightly Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market stopped rising and fell back. This was mainly because the recent surge had been too great, and those holding stock certificates were changing their minds and selling off, and rumors were spreading, causing the situation to soften. However, the buying momentum of several stocks has not diminished, and they are still progressing upward. For example, the Commercial Press stock in the cultural industry is in short supply, and buyers have bid up to 900 yuan, 880 yuan at noon, a huge increase of 30 yuan. Since the start of the rally on January 12, it has risen by a full double, a total increase of 435 yuan. The highest price of China was 315 yuan, but it soon retreated to 302.5 yuan, and then rose another 2.5 yuan, also a total increase of 145 yuan since the rise that day. The World Book Company was weaker, falling from 187.5 yuan to 178 yuan, and slightly rebounded to 80 yuan at noon, a decrease of 10 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw a high price of 31.5 yuan amid buying from new and old investors, but then fell back to 30 yuan, still a huge increase of 1.75 yuan. The Sino-French has returned to the 40 yuan mark, once falling from 41 yuan to 37.75 yuan, and was pulled up to 39 yuan at noon, a small increase of 7.5 cents. Minyi fell slightly to 63-4 yuan, Xinyi was flat and tired at 315 yuan, Dachina Match rose another 5 yuan, hovering around 440 yuan, and the Nanyang Tobacco Company also had huge fluctuations, once seeing 237.5 yuan, falling back to 220 yuan, and 25 yuan at noon. Public utilities fell sharply, with Zhabei Water and Electricity falling slightly from 137.5 yuan to 125 yuan, and 27 yuan at noon, a small decrease of 10 yuan, which is still a small rebound after a continuous increase of 70 yuan and 5 cents. China Electric was hovering around the 90 yuan mark, a small decrease of 2 yuan. The department store industry seemed to be falling, with Wing On Company falling back after breaking through the 190 yuan mark, once plunging from 192 yuan to 181.5 yuan, and rebounding to 186 yuan at noon, a small decrease of 2 yuan. Sincere Company fell from 207.5 yuan to 196 yuan, and then rebounded to around 200 yuan. National Goods Company was also down 5 to 3 yuan at around 92-4 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Yarn Factory saw 482.5 yuan and then fell sharply to 450 yuan, 62.5 yuan at noon. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was 700 yuan, and No. 3 Factory was 560 yuan, with few sales. Small denominations were stable, with American wool close to 20 yuan, Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing rising to 13 yuan, Gonghe 58 yuan, and Zhongxing Wood Industry rising again to 13.5 yuan. The market situation is good, but trading is not active.</p>
<h3>Category C Bonds Reach 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>The public bond market rebounded again yesterday, breaking through the 80 yuan mark. Although there were not many transactions, the market fluctuated greatly. Category C rose from 77.9 yuan to 82.5 yuan, and the final price was 0.12 yuan. Category A traded at 78 yuan. Category B traded at 7 to 7.3 yuan, Category D at 76 yuan, and Category E at 76.8 yuan, probably due to the sellers covering their positions.</p>
<h3>Although Transactions of Daily Necessities are Scarce, Prices Still Rise Without Falling</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities remains firm despite the quiet trading. Phoenix brand matches were 5,200 yuan, and Beauty brand were 5,300 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous day. Golden Tripod brand were 4,300 yuan, and Miscellaneous brand were 2,900 yuan, unchanged. Solid Soap was 980 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 980 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 830 yuan, and Scissors Soap was 950 yuan. Price's Candles were 580 yuan, Monk's Hat brand were 530 yuan, and Miscellaneous brand were 380 yuan. The trend continues to rise without falling.</p>
<p>Economic Knowledge</p>
<h3>Notes on the Establishment of a Limited Liability Company (1)</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Bank is a member bank of the Shanghai Banking Association. Since its establishment, it has enjoyed a remarkable reputation. In order to serve the society, it has compiled all the statutory procedures and preparatory practices that should be followed when starting a business, and explained them in detail. It has produced a separate booklet called "Notes on the Establishment of a Limited Liability Company." Entrepreneurs only need to read the content to handle all preparatory and registration procedures themselves. The attached official documents and forms are especially practical. In addition to discussing various issues in the economic community and reporting various news in the economic community, this newspaper's "Economic Circle" also pays attention to the dissemination of economic knowledge, in line with the newspaper's consistent policy and spirit of serving society. With the consent of the China Industrial Bank, the contents of "Notes on the Establishment of a Limited Liability Company" are published here for wide circulation. —Editor</p>
<p>In recent years, the establishment of new companies in Shanghai has been booming, especially new banks, money houses, insurance companies, enterprise companies, and industrial companies. Examining their organization, most are limited liability companies. To facilitate the progress of entrepreneurs, the statutory procedures that should be known for establishing a limited liability company have been collected and compiled into a chapter for reference.</p>
<p>(A) Key points of legal provisions:</p>
<p>1. Founders subscribe to sufficient shares and publicly raise sufficient shares Company Law Article 87: "A limited liability company shall have seven or more founders." Article 90: "When the founders have subscribed to the total number of shares, they shall immediately pay the first installment of shares according to their shares and elect directors and supervisors." Article 93: "If the founders do not subscribe to sufficient shares, the total number of shares shall be raised." Article 26 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law: "The total number of shares subscribed by the founders of a limited liability company shall not be less than one-twentieth of the total share capital; if the total share capital is less than one million yuan, it shall not be less than one-tenth." The establishment of a company may be by the founders subscribing to sufficient shares, or by the founders subscribing to part of the shares and publicly soliciting part from the outside world. However, the shares subscribed by the founders shall not be less than one-twentieth of the total amount: if the total share capital is less than one million yuan, it shall not be less than one-tenth. Article 23 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law stipulates: "When establishing a limited liability company, a business plan, the names and experience of the founders, and the number of shares subscribed shall be prepared first, and the prospectus shall be submitted to the competent authority for record by all the founders before stock can be solicited; but when the founders subscribe to the total amount of shares, the prospectus may not be prepared." Article 99 of the Company Law stipulates: "After the first installment of shares is paid, the founders shall convene the founding meeting within three months." Article 102 stipulates: "The founding meeting shall elect directors and supervisors." Therefore, the founders who subscribe to the total number of shares may be exempted from holding a founding meeting and may directly elect directors and supervisors; while those who publicly solicit part of the shares shall convene a founding meeting within three months after the first installment of shares is paid, and elect directors and supervisors from the founding meeting. However, according to Article 116 of the Company Law, the shares of the founders shall not be transferred within one year after the company starts business. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Stock Market Outside the Market</h3>
<p>The Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mine stock was only 18 or 9 yuan not long ago, but this week it suddenly jumped from 21 yuan to over 50 yuan. The reason for this special rise is probably: 1. The stock did not rise much last year, and the market price was less than half of the face value. 2. The chips on the market are extremely tight, so even unpopular mining stocks are valued by buyers.</p>
<p>Since the New Year, there have been several new stocks listed, such as Luen Wha Real Estate, Tongji Dyeing and Weaving, and Zhongxing Wood Industry. After the opening, they have also been purchased and the transactions are not quiet. The Chinese stock market is inherently short of chips. When the supply of old stock chips cannot meet the demand, new stocks can be launched as a source of energy, which is sufficient to meet the actual needs of the market. Since the listing of new stocks, there have been many parties who are cautious about this matter, fearing that they will fall into the past mistakes.</p>
<p>The Kangyuan Canning Factory stock has always been stable. In recent days, due to the news of generous dividends and the sharp rise in tinplate prices, the market has been unanimously upward and the price has risen rapidly. According to recent trends, there may be a possibility of continued rise.</p>
<h3>Allied Currency Down Another Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association did not change and remained at 18%.</p>
<p>Japanese military tickets are stable, with inter-dealer prices at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, 5 hao. The difference between small money houses and bank door prices is still 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 4 and a half fen. Allied bank notes are down another three cents, with operators selling at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen and buying in at 3 yuan, 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Wholesale, Sales Market are Quiet</h3>
<p>The cigarette market continues to show a soft trend, mainly because the wholesale and sales markets are weak, and prices are uniformly downward. British brand cigarettes are 3,400 yuan per case, Old Knife brand are 10,550 yuan, Pin Hai brand are 8,550 yuan, Fairy brand are 8,150 yuan, and Five Flowers brand are 7,250 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand are 3,300 yuan, Golden Building are 4,250 yuan, Red Rose are 2,850 yuan, Quanlu brand are 3,950 yuan, Nian Zhi are 3,450 yuan, and Guide brand are 3,300 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid are 7,800 yuan, Beauty brand are 7,350 yuan, Golden Mouse are 4,400 yuan, and White Golden Dragon are 4,800 yuan, all down 50 to 100 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Household Medicines Want to Fall But Stop</h3>
<p>The market for household medicines was once weak, but yesterday the opening prices were still strong. Headache powder was 47 yuan, Balm was 59 yuan, Bagua Dan was 50 yuan, Partridge Vegetables were 82 yuan, and Dragon and Tiger Rendan was 50 yuan, a much stronger rebound than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Continues to Decline</h3>

<h3>Bamboo Steel Bars Still Highly Priced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for bamboo steel bars was still not lively. The biggest reason is probably the decline in the local construction industry and the stagnation of customer sales. However, the market price is high due to the weak inventory. Currently, the market price for three-four-point patterns is 15,000 yuan per ton, five-point to one-inch is 14,500 yuan per ton, and the standard price for unified patterns is 14,000 yuan per ton. In addition, road skin heads are 15,000 yuan per ton, angle iron heads are 12,000 yuan per ton, foreign square plate heads are 11,000 yuan per ton, black iron skin heads are 28,000 yuan per ton, and chimney skin heads are 30,000 yuan per ton. (The above patterns are subject to additional charges).</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the North-South Goods Market</h3>
<p>Suzhou-Hangzhou Native Products Red and Black Dates: Recently, due to the stirring of Suzhou and Hangzhou and rising production prices, the market has suddenly trended higher. Currently, the market price for unified raw black dates is 700 to 720 yuan, Boping high-grade dates are 900 to 1,000 yuan, and Guangzhou high-grade black dates are 1,100 to 1,200 yuan. Leling high-grade red dates open at 680 yuan, Red Date King is 750 yuan, and Special King Dates are 800 yuan. One yuan.</p>
<p>Longan on the Way: Due to the lack of Gulangyu ships, there has been no delivery of large quantities of miscellaneous longan for more than a month. According to a telegram from the customer, a batch has been shipped, but the amount is small, and the subsequent transportation is unknown, so there are not many raw goods in the market, and there is no temporary loosening.</p>
<p>Jinshan Round Branch Price Slightly Increases: Although there have been few arrivals recently, there are still many stocks in Shanghai, and the holders are insisting, so prices are tightening. Yesterday, several hundred boxes were opened on the market, the goods are still good, and the price has risen by 20 yuan compared to before, with a sign of stabilization.</p>
<h3>Publication of the Industry and Commerce Directory</h3>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Directory for this year, edited by Xu Wancheng, has been published.

A thick volume in Western-style binding is priced at 120 yuan and is distributed by Longwen Bookstore in the Salt Industry Building on Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>"Little Food, Much Work" in the United States: Food Reduced - Work Increased</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the capital of Brazil on February 17: The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that 25% of U.S. agricultural products this year will be supplied to the U.S. military and countries enjoying Lend-Lease rights, so the amount of various foods allowed to be sold within the United States this year will be greatly reduced compared to last year. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Lisbon on February 17: The working hours of U.S. national workers have previously been extended from 40 hours per week to 48 hours, but recently, in view of the need to increase working hours in major wartime industries, the result may be extended to 52 hours per week.</p>
<h3>Development of Central China Currency Operations (1)</h3>
<p>1. The Status of Military Tickets in China:</p>
<p>The use of military tickets did not begin with the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War, nor is it solely a Japanese patent. However, the wide range of use, the long period, and the complexity of its surrounding relationships can be said to have been caused by the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War. At present, although military tickets are also widely used in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, and other places, those that can stand out, whether in terms of the amount issued or the position they occupy in the local economy, must be the military tickets in Central and South China.</p>
<p>During the China Incident, military tickets were not commonly used throughout China. In North China, they have not been commonly used to this day. Initially, Korean Bank notes and Hebei Bank notes were used to pay the military's salaries, and later the United Reserve Bank was established, which replaced them with Allied notes. In the industry, Japanese bank notes were initially used to pay local military expenses, and military tickets were used from November 26th of the Republic of China. This was a necessary method to prevent the decline of the Japanese currency due to the increase in the amount of Japanese currency issued. However, in South China, military tickets have been commonly used since the Imperial Army landed in Beihai in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China. These military tickets in Central and South China are not the same as the military tickets commonly used in the so-called Southern Circle. The latter mainly serve as a medium of exchange for local currency.</p>
<p>Although the general outline of Central China military tickets is as described above, the path of development of these military tickets is not entirely smooth. Because the old legal currency, which is deeply rooted and trusted by the Chinese people, exists locally, it is bound to suffer its frontal attack. In June of the previous year, the exchange rate between military tickets and reserve notes was 18 to 100, and the exchange rate between reserve notes and the old legal currency was 1 to 2; but three or four years ago, at the beginning of the 29th year of the Republic of China, 100 yuan of legal currency was equivalent to 78 yuan of military tickets according to the Shanghai exchange rate, which became 60 yuan in October of that year, 58 yuan in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China, 50 yuan at the end of March, and dropped to 30 yuan from the end of September to the beginning of October. On the 22nd of that month, the price of 27 yuan was shouted out. In November, it plummeted. On the 11th of that month, it dropped to 22 yuan and a quarter. It had risen slightly at the end of the month. The day the Greater East Asia War broke out, it returned to more than 30 yuan, but this was two and a half times lower than at the beginning of the 29th year of the Republic of China, and one could not help but feel the changes of the past and present.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the official price of military tickets against the legal currency was set at 25 yuan from the 15th, and this exchange rate continued for a period of time, but in March, it became 13 yuan. At the end of that month, the equal exchange of new and old legal currency was cancelled, and it was declared that reserve notes would be supported by military tickets. After May, the old legal currency fell to 9 yuan. After June 8, the exchange rate between the new and old legal currency was 1 to 2, and military tickets and reserve notes were stipulated to be 18 to 100.

<h3>Just Think</h3>
<p>— Ru Ling</p>
<p>A person must have doubts in whatever he does, and doubt leads to progress. For example, when doing something or reading a book, if the thing you are doing is not on the right path, or the book you are reading is not practical, and others point it out to you, you don't listen and do your own thing; if others advise you, you don't accept it and think you are right. Once the truth is revealed, it is too late to regret, so you comfort yourself: "I just thought it was like this." "Just think" means not being willing to study, not being willing to doubt. Throughout history, these two words have buried the future of countless talents and destroyed the great cause of countless heroes.</p>
<p>Cui Dongbi (Shu), a great scholar of the Qing Dynasty, hated the perfunctory people who used "just think" as their catchphrase. He used the pragmatic spirit of "breaking the casserole and asking to the end" to study history and scholarship. The magnum opus "Record of Examination and Belief" was obtained through this kind of hard work. He has a poem "Just Think Line", denouncing the wrongs of "just think", saying:</p>
<p>"Not seeing the reason for observing the action, the two words 'just think' lie across the chest, Yi Qin's eloquent mouth is like a hanging river, how can his skills be exhausted by just thinking? The former only thought he knew it was wrong, the latter only thought he didn't realize it, all the great diseases in the world can be cured, but only 'just think' cannot be implemented".</p>
<p>"Just think" is a major obstacle to all undertakings. When an apple falls to the ground, others just think it is a normal thing, but Newton invented the law of universal gravitation. Eighty years ago, if Edison's mother had just thought that her son was a naughty and foolish child, I'm afraid there would be no electric lights on earth today.</p>
<p>Overthrow "just think", these two words that have misled all living beings!</p>
<h3>Third Place Winner of the January Submission Contest - My Life as a Teacher (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Si Yiwei</p>
<p>My nearly twenty years of teaching have already left me with streaks of grey hair. Yet, upon reflection, it feels like chewing on vegetable roots or olives. Beyond the bland, sour, and astringent taste, there's a unique fragrance and sweetness.</p>
<p>My teaching career began as a teaching assistant at the university, lasting about seven or eight years. These years, spent among accomplished scholars, provided me with experiences and knowledge several times greater than in my secondary school days. As a novice teacher, I put in extra effort, always preparing thoroughly, fearing inadequacy. I studied biology and would prepare experimental materials for students until midnight before returning to my dormitory. During the day, I corrected papers and taught classes, leaving no spare time. Of course, I had to avoid being stumped by students, which would make them look down on the assistant. But mostly, it was driven by the pursuit of knowledge and the joyful stimulation I received when answering students' questions in the classroom, that I forgot my fatigue! In the lab, when students had difficulty observing something clearly, I felt even worse than if I myself couldn't observe it clearly! I tried my best to patiently guide them repeatedly, ensuring they had a satisfying experience. Because, during my own student days, I hated the pretentious attitude of teachers who made students afraid to approach them, answering questions casually just to get it over with. Therefore, I often encouraged myself not to develop such a habit. However, with dozens of students continuously asking questions for several hours, my energy would inevitably flag. If students kept asking and asking, unable to find what I had helped them find under the microscope, and repeatedly asked me to find it again, I couldn't control myself and would speak angrily. Then, the difficulty of practicing the saying "tireless in teaching and patient in guidance" became evident! The biggest lesson I learned during these years was that teaching is learning! Learning means responsibility rests solely on me. Teaching, however, means I am responsible for many. Making a mistake for myself is a small matter; misleading other people’s children is a great matter.</p>
<p>Later, due to excessive physical and mental exhaustion, I finally fell ill, so ill that I was forbidden from teaching again! But because of my circumstances, for the sake of livelihood, I had to teach again. Later, I went to a secondary school in the inland to be a biology teacher. Here, because the local environment was good, I wasn't as busy and stressed as I had been at the university. Moreover, the school authorities placed great trust in me, allowing me to develop the biology course freely. The youthful innocence and passion for learning in the children made my health improve day by day. At this time, because the textbooks were not suitable for the local area, I took the time to compile my own mixed teaching materials on animals and plants, initiated experimental guidance, and established a Biological Research Society. Investigating the local biological environment helped instill in students an experimental attitude and a spirit of earnest practice. This secondary school was considered the only higher education institution in the town, so teachers received respect from the general public. The Education Bureau even designated me as a consultant in the elementary education association. Consequently, several elementary school natural science teachers would often bring flowers, plants, and insects found by the roadside to ask about their names and classifications. I had never studied or seen these things when I was in school, so I felt quite embarrassed. Therefore, I had to put in some effort myself, buy a few reference books, and study on my own. Over three years, I learned to recognize many wildflowers and weeds, which allowed me to add more material to my classroom lectures.</p>
<p>I remember the day I resigned from my teaching position there and left, it was snowing heavily. The students braved the snow to take photos and see me off. At two o'clock that morning, the ship set sail, and several male and female students were waiting in the cold moonlight, stepping on the snow. They personally carried my luggage onto the cabin and settled me in before waving goodbye at the final whistle. This scene of reluctant farewell made me forget all the hardships I had endured in those three years.</p>
<p>After the incident, everything changed drastically, and we teachers were the first to suffer. For the past four or five years, I have managed not to give up this teaching pointer and still stand in my own position. Now, I will talk about these years of life from several aspects.</p>
<h3>Laborious Excavators</h3>
<p>— By Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>Scientists tell us: that humans evolved from apes.</p>
<p>However, scientists cannot make empty claims; they must provide concrete evidence—the remains of ape-men—otherwise, they cannot prove their claims.</p>
<p>Thus, our excavator, Dr. Eugène Dubois, at the end of the 19th century, abandoned his quiet position as a professor of anatomy at the Amsterdam University in the Netherlands, and joined the army as a medical officer in the Dutch colonial forces, resolutely departing for the distant island of Sumatra.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Sumatra, Dubois immediately and enthusiastically engaged in searching and excavating. One month passed, then another, and even a third. The excavated soil piled up like mountains, but there was still no trace of ape-man bones.</p>
<p>If someone else were in Dubois's position, they might have abandoned this fruitless excavation long ago, because ape-man bones were not necessarily in this place, and the area that should be excavated was so vast!</p>
<p>But our Dubois continued to excavate relentlessly, year after year...</p>
<p>Dubois's sorrows were not just once, and he did not just grit his teeth and carry on just once. He never abandoned his belief.</p>
<p>Having failed to find ape-men in Sumatra, he decided to try his luck in Java.</p>
<p>Here, he finally had luck.</p>
<p>In the riverbed of the Bengawan Solo River at the foot of Mount Kendeng, he found two teeth, a femur, and a skullcap of ape-men.</p>
<p>The laborious excavator finally discovered his treasure, and his relentless spirit made him succeed.</p>
<p>Belief is power—the lessons of our predecessors tell us.</p>
<p>To those who are still excavating treasures in their own fields, when you feel disappointed, don't forget that you still have to grit your teeth and excavate. Because there are treasures in your fields, but your efforts have not yet reached the highest stage.</p>
<p>Cultivate your courage, patience, and strength, to be a laborious excavator, and in the future, your efforts will be rewarded.</p>
<h3>Decisiveness</h3>
<p>— By Xiaolin</p>
<p>What a pity! How many great undertakings in the world have been ruined by the words "hesitation and indecision." How many intelligences and talents have been buried by it.</p>
<p>Voltaire said: "Hesitation is a very obvious defect in character." Without a strong character, one has no purpose in life. Others and oneself do not know what one will do next, like a ship without sails or a rudder, drifting east and west with the wind and waves until it hits a reef or is shattered by a big storm.</p>
<p>Opportunities for success often come suddenly; you must seize them with decisiveness. Don't think of this one moment and that the next. You would rather make a decision and fail than develop a habit of procrastination, because doing always has a greater chance of success than not doing.</p>
<p>So-called decisiveness is wise decisiveness, because foolish people can also make decisions, but those are just stubborn decisions. Wise decisiveness relies on careful consideration of reason and self-confidence, while stubborn decisions are simply based on personal prejudices without thinking and stubbornly insisting on a decision. Therefore, the two are absolutely different.</p>
<p>Shakespeare said: "I will remember that when Caesar says to do this, it is done for him." Everyone should remember this sentence.</p>
<h3>Health Problems Under High Pressure of Life</h3>
<p>— By Zhaowen</p>
<p>The threat of life has increased the importance of health problems. This is most deeply felt by the majority of people in society who rely on work for a living. Because when one is healthy, one can still maintain a minimal life with personal effort in work. But once health is lost, for the average person with no savings, not only do they feel unable to solve the problem of livelihood, but the burden of medical expenses follows, which inevitably puts them in a state of extreme suffering.</p>
<p>Therefore, under this high pressure of life, every working person should pay twelve points of attention to their health, and should regard health as the capital of life, carefully maintaining this capital of life, without shortage or loss, because this is the most important prerequisite for living under the high pressure of life.</p>
<p>The author puts forward the following three points regarding maintaining the capital of life—health—to urge everyone to pay attention:</p>
<p>(1) Prevent disease when there is no disease (2) Know disease before it manifests (3) Treat disease in its early stages</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, one must pay attention to all hygiene at ordinary times. Regarding the second and third points, one should undergo a health check every year, because there are many latent diseases that one is unaware of. Once examined, they can be detected immediately. Because they are detected early, early treatment is easier to restore health, and it also saves medical expenses. At the same time, early return to work has no significant impact on the problem of livelihood.</p>
<p>A Chinese health company has recently been established in this city. Its work focuses on health checks to achieve health maintenance. As the name suggests, the company should make considerable contributions to improving the health of citizens in the future. We hereby express our infinite hopes.</p>
<h3>Those Heavily Burdened by Life</h3>
<p>— By Bao Jingke</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Generations</h3>
<p>— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>"Very good. Turn to page forty, starting from the last line."</p>
<p>The sound of explosions was still deafening, and the whole house shook as if it were being uprooted from its foundation. Maynard found the page, which was in the front of the book, and then read in a high-pitched voice:</p>
<p>"Genus hoc erat pugnae—This was the kind of fighting… Quo se germani exercuerant—The Germans practiced themselves in this. Oh, sir, this is very good—this is really interesting, sir, one of your best things—"</p>
<p>The laughter began, and Chips went on: "Um-hum—you can see—now—that these dead languages—um-hum—can sometimes—come alive again—can't they? Eh?"</p>
<p>Later they learned that five bombs had fallen within and around Brookfield, one of the closest being outside the school grounds. Nine people were killed.</p>
<p>The story was told and exaggerated again and again: "That dear old boy didn't even have a hair out of place. Even found the old passage to explain the situation at the time. Something about the way the Germans fought in Caesar’s writings. You wouldn't think there'd be anything like that in Caesar’s writings, would you? And the way Chips laughed: you know the way he really laughs... tears just streaming down his face... never saw him laugh so much..."</p>
<p>He was a historical footnote.</p>
<p>Wearing old and worn clothes, his steps beginning to falter, his gentle eyes peering out from behind steel-rimmed glasses, his clever and humorous speech—Brookfield did not want him to change in the slightest.</p>
<p>November 11, 1918.</p>
<p>The news came in the morning: school was let out for the day, and everyone demanded that the kitchen staff find a way to make as lavish a feast as possible, usually made over several days. There were many cheers and songs, and a bread fight broke out in the dining hall. (40)</p>
