<p>社評</p>
<h3>「高調」與「低調」都要不得</h3>
<p>「竭誠擁護」府決定改善民生的政策，衷心督促政府執行改善民生的政策，」這是輿論界的天職，也就是不能放棄的責任。所以。凡與民生有關的問題，我們就不避大聲疾呼，重複申論。我們的心裏坦白，我們的態度誠摯，更爲責任心的驅使，說出大衆要說的話，就不辭忌諱，不惜開罪，率直陳詞。因此，難免觸犯少數人的「尊嚴」，說我們在「濫唱高調」。本來，「事實勝於雄辯」，我們不屑作多餘的辯論。不過，我們願意乘便略爲申引，以糾正少數人的誤解與曲解。</p>
<p>什麼是「高調」？凡是事實上沒有能力做到，或不可能做到的，而偏偏喊着一定要做到，結果做不到的，就是「高調」。一味「誇大」，「吹牛」，不顧實際，言而無信的，也是「高調」。</p>
<p>什麼是「低調」？凡是有能力，或可能做到，而自暴自棄，諉過托詞的，就是「低調」。無自信心，無自尊心，振不起精神的，也是「低調」。</p>
<p>凡關於政治上，經濟上的主張，與國計民生絕對有利益，而只要用決心毅力，必定可以做到者，這種主張，決非「高調」。譬如國民政府最近主張的「澈底澈查投機囤積」，「嚴厲禁止賭博」；譬如本報主張的「官商分野」，「設立人民參政體制」等等，都與國計民生絕對有利益，而只要有決心毅力都可以做到的，這種主張，決非「高調」。</p>
<p>更舉一個近例，如年高德劭的在主席，五月四日恭逢誕辰，各方紛紛奉伸慶祝，但主席爲矯正習俗，謝絕祝壽，而上海某銀行一高級職員，年齒尙稚，聞爲了慶壽，竟專派飛機往北京携名伶來滬堂會，這兩件事相形之下，也許有人說前者是「高調」。可是我們看　在主席廿四日的手論，謝絕一切；廿七日更以國府命令，嚴禁以祝壽名義獻金，且引西安事變前之醜熊爲戒。像這樣用決心說到做到的事實，我們萬萬不能認爲「高調」。値此非常時期，一國領袖，以身作則，自更能收人民視聽一新之效。政府能將這種意義，推而廣之，則「高調」之說，必從此絕響。</p>
<p>進一步說，對於某種主張，要完成理想，達到目的，雖則爲目前的力量和環境所不及實現的，但這種主張，不算「高調」。譬如：國民政府主張的中日和平運動，其理想與目的，無疑是「全面和平」，雖爲目前力量所不及實現，我們決不能因而誤解它是「高調」。同樣理由的，本報主張「澈底澈查投機囤積」，「嚴厲禁止賭博」。「官商分野」，「設立人民參政體制」，其理想與目的正與政府主張同一旨趣，這其間旣無「高調」與「低調」之分，更不能誤解之爲「高調」。</p>
<p>於此，我們可以下一個定義：「凡可能完成理想，達到目的的主張，雖爲一時力量所不及實現，不算高調」。可是，這定義還有一個前提條件的，就是「要以決心毅力去做」，而不能袖手等待理想與目的的實現。所以政治上，經濟上，縱使有很好理想的主張，如「全面和運」如「澈查囤積」等等，如果不以決心毅力去做，那末原來不是「高調」的，也很容易變成「高調」了。又如政府已下令禁賭，而上海仍有賭塲，政府並未做到自己的主張，就是原來不是「高調」而將變成「高調」的事例。</p>
<p>我們旣須愼防我們的主張，本來不是「高調」，而因不用決心毅力去做。就將變成眞的「高調」。同時，我們更須特別注意，凡是應當做的事而不去做；也就是有能力做到，而自暴自棄，文過托非的不去做，這更將由「低調」，而變做「無調」，那才是最危險的現象。</p>
<p>我們翻開古今中外的歷史，一個國家，一個執政的政府，在政治失常的時候，往往在朝者有時喜唱「低調」，甚至於「無調」。而對人民的呼聲往往誤認爲「高調」。可是，現在我們在什麼時代，必須睜開眼來，我們的國家，今天是在爭取生存千鈞一髮的時候，必需上下一致，脚踏實地，以決心毅力，完成我們的理想，達到我們的目的，絕對不容許有「高調」「低調」之分了。</p>
<p>所以，我們認爲政府與人民，亟須打成一片，人民絕對不能批評政府的主張與表現爲「高調」，或「低調」；惟有以竭誠來擁護政府，支援政府，督促政府，貫澈主張，實施政令，完成政治的理想。如果政府願意人民啞口無言，或願聽阿諛之詞，則政府將何所根據而眞正與民更始呢？「忠言逆耳」，原指「常」人所不可受者而言，在此非常時期，我們期望有「非常」之領導人物，接受「常人」所不能受之「忠言」。其他雖居領導地位，而無「非常」之氣度，以受忠言者，我們更無所期待了。</p>
<p>最後，凡與國家和人民有利益者，政府須不加顧慮，放手做去；反之。有弊害者，即須澈底肅淸之，此即政府與人民打成一片的惟一途徑。</p>

<h3>日本政府正式發表　谷正之任駐華大使　大使對華有深切理解與同情　到任後兩國關係必更臻親密</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日天皇陛下於今日下午三時，在宮中鳳凰閣，於東條首相侍立下，舉行新任駐華大使谷正之親任式，向新大使賜親任勅語後，即由東條首相傳達官印職印，同時並正式發表任從三位動　等谷正之爲駐中華民國特命全權大使。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　前仟日駐中國大使重光自榮任外務大臣後，日政府對駐中國大使後任人選，曾愼重銓衡；又爲適應世界戰局，並根據雄渾之理想，以完成對華新政策起見，認前任外相谷正之最爲適任。日政府自得谷正之氏之應諾後，即以外交上所定之手續，徵求中華民國國民政府之同意，本月二十六日國府之正式同意書，即已送達日政府，遂於本日十五時在宮內正式舉行駐華大使親任式。</p>
<p>東京廿八中央社電　日新任駐華大使谷正之　於今日親任式完畢後，即在大東亞省接見記者團，對强化中日提携，暢談抱負。大意謂大東亞戰爭爆發後，中國方面對東亞共同敵人之自覺，亦日漸高昂，結果國府乃於一月九日毅然參戰，與我國結成共同戰綫，努力於擊英美，解放東亞，建設共榮圈。帝國政府爲滴應此新事態，亦以協助國府强化政治力爲目的，斷然實行撤廢在華治外法權，交還租界，中國百年夙顧願之主權完整，已得以完成。中日兩國之共存共榮，亦因此而走上其本然之軌道。今後我國之必澈底實行此新政策，實已固母待　言，此在建設大東亞新秩序上，實有極大意義，故其結果，影響於大東亞各民族，以至全世界者，誠難估計。余此次拜受大命，必以前綫將士之專爲志，深處政府方針，挺身於中日提携之强化，且於目下中日關係之重要，當儘早啟程，的定於五月中旬，可抵南京履任。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日前外相谷正之於前次內閣改組辭去外相戰務後，尙未及月，卽被任爲駐華大使。當此中日兩國關係業已進入新階段時，穀前外相之繼任駐華大使，實足使中日關係將益形緊密，同時亦於此可見日本與中國協力提携之決意。蓋中日兩國之傳統友好關係，自中日事變發生後，卽益趨複雜；其後國府還都南京，中日關係乃再趨明朗。大東嚴戰爭爆發後，自本年年初國府即向英美宣戰，日政府亦實施推進中日關係之新政策，協助中國恢復國權，於是中日關係乃更進入新階段。而今後日本之實施推進中日關係政策，亦將益趨重大。谷大使過去任外相兼情報局總裁時，即與靑木大東亞相在中樞共同策劃推進中日關係之要，此决出任駐華大使實最適當。抑此次異動，重光與谷適互相對調，亦可見日政府推進中日新關係之決意。如此，可更加强中國之協力，以粉碎外方，協助中國建設，以期完成大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　中國參戰後，中日關係已進入一新階段，日本益積極努力於對華政策之實踐，重光前大使任內，曾完成首先交還租界以及撤廢治外法權等之善意友好外交措施，吾國朝野對此成爲感謝。茲者重光大使已轉任日外務大臣，日本政府頃已日前外相谷正之繼重光之後使華我政府對谷新大使之歡迎期待，已見於林宣傳部長，周外交次長等之談話。吾國朝野均渴望任　之谷大使早日履新；然吾人特應注意者，谷大使乃當此中日關係愈加緊密之際而榮任此職者，亦即靑木大東亞大臣之直接食責人，視其經歷，可知係一對華最有認識，對中日兩國關係，兩民族同生共死精神，必具有理解與熱忱之士。重光前大使雖於其任內完成撤廢治外法權，交還專營租界等偉舉，然正因此中日關係更進一層，今後諸施策，亦愈値期待。吾人更可預斷谷新大使到任後，中日關係必更加密切，兩國協力得再進一層展開，並早日完成交還專營租界，撤廢治外法權等以後應有之各項施策。</p>
<h3>國府當局歡迎辭</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　日政府發表谷正之繼任駐華大使後，宣傳部長林柏生特應記者問，發表歡迎談話如左：「重光大使榮調外相之後，外間對於繼任人選，寄予甚深之注意。溯自我國參戰以來，中日關係益增敦睦，以適應戰時需；而奠定東亞共榮圈建設之基礎，繼任大使必爲强化邦交能員，而與東條總理大臣以次重光外相，靑木大東亞相，根本政策相切合，自屬無煩揣測。今重光大使轉任外相，谷外相轉任大使，其爲使兩國邦交繼承過去之發展，而益趨强化，瞭然可見。此不僅國民政府同人極表歡迎，即一般政論家亦均慶得人也。去年秋間，本人赴友邦考察靑少年組織訓練，其時谷大使正新任外相，款待殷勤，且予以種種援助，本人旣獲承敎益，又能達成使命，感荷之忱，無時或忘。憶當時本人曾談及中日兩國之間，雖有太平洋一水之隔，但站在整個東亞之立塲上，兩國間本然之　係，非大海所能阻斷，爲使兩國國民在汰平洋上造起一座鐵橋，本人深願以其餘生與中國靑年，共同追隨先進國之後，從事此鐵橋之建築。重光大使及谷外相，對此偉大工程，會克盡其史大之努力，現在重光大使轉任外相，谷犬使轉任大使，益見此鐵橋之建築工作正在加緊，而成功之期不遠矣」。</p>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　日政府現已發表前外相谷正之繼任駐華大使，我國外交部次長周隆庠特就此發表談話如下：「此次友邦日本政府仟命谷前外相爲駐華大使，本人聞悉之餘，母任欣慰，敬表竭誠歡迎之忱。谷大使資深望重，服務日本外交界垂三十年，經騐宏富，還宇馳名，歷任駐歐美各國使館要職，長外務省亞細亞局有年，會一度以公使資格駐滬，對於中日提携，夙具理解與熱忱。去年本人隨從訪日，在東京親聆谷大使關於大局之高論與偉抱，允深感動，　憶過去谷大使在外務大臣任內負荷擘劃日本戰時外交之重責，時値我國宜佈參加大東亞戰爭，其間對於中日邦交，貢獻尤多，如關於交還租界，撤廢治外法權等，無不竭誠援助。此次奉命使華，足證日本對華外交政策，不特無絲毫變更，且更能本於谷大使之努力予以貫澈，而使中日邦交益臻敦睦化，國府之政策，益見具體實現。現大東亞戰爭着着勝利，已將百年來英美在東亞之殖民地主義消滅盡凈，東亞民族之解放與東亞新秩序之建設，已奠定堅强不拔之基礎。今後確保此勝利與鞏固此建設之基礎，實有賴於東亞各民族之精誠團結。　憶去年隨從訪日時，谷大使歡迎詞中，曾謂今日中日兩國間之提携，已達完璧之域，誠堪同慶。顧兩國間之提携，非僅爲一時之利害關係，而爲中日基本關係。條約中所載，實以建設新秩序之共同理想爲基礎，具有精神團結之特色。吾人深信谷大使使華，必能使中日兩大民族作更進一步之精誠團結，以貢獻於大東亞戰爭，俾最後勝利之獲得，及新秩序之建設，得以早日完成也」。</p>

<h3>晉南晶軍　擴大戰果</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　日軍精銳各部隊自佔領渝軍「第廿四集團軍」根據地臨淇後，即繼續掃蕩盤據西方山岳地帶之渝「新編第五軍」及「第四十軍」約二萬名之殘餘部隊，現已大部被殲。至廿七日日軍乃轉鋒實施對盤據陵川南方奪火鎭橫水村附近劉進部下蔣嫡系軍「第廿七軍」主力開始包圍戰，日軍各部隊保持緊密之連絡，對敵猛烈攻擊，逐决縮小包圍圈。此外並捕捉盤據臨淇東南方東姚集之渝「第四十軍」所部「第一百零六師帥長」李振靑，的二千餘之日軍部隊亦於廿七日開始猛攻，目前戰時已至最後階段，日軍對渝「第廿四集團軍」之掃蕩戰，已漸吿完成，因此渝軍於華北唯一之殘存勢力亦已殆盡。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　據晉南太行山前綫，渝第二十四集團軍主力因日軍突入臨淇，已頓趨潰亂，其殘餘部隊乃被迫向太行山峻嶮山岳地帶臨淇盆地西方潰竄，日軍偵知該集團軍總司令龐炳動，第二十七軍軍長劉進，及第四十軍軍長馬步吾等已牽少數衛兵逃出重團，向太行山中逃遁，乃於二十五日起開始向山中搜索，克服困難山路，奮勇進擊。截至二十七日止，日軍各部隊所獲之戰果如次：（一）自二十五日起，猛攻龐炳勳及第四十軍第二十九師師長李運通部之日軍各部隊，於二十七日在田家井西南三十公里處圍殲渝殘軍的六百人，結果俘虜二百人，並截獲輕機槍四十挺，步槍五十枚，現仍追擊中。（一）日軍各部隊於二十七日晨在南嶺臨洪西方二十三公里附近，痛擊向臨淇盆地西方潰退之渝新編第五軍，將其澈底擊潰，是役渝軍遺屍三一具，被俘一一〇人，日軍截獲重機槍一挺，輕機槍三十挺，步槍五十枝，彈藥一五〇〇〇發，軍用馬二〇匹。又其他日軍郁隊則在并郤村臨淇西方三十五公里附近猛攻渝第四十軍，俘虜渝軍一四五人，截獲步槍三百三十枝，彈藥一七〇〇〇發。（一）日軍各部隊在則界村合溪鎭周團，擊毀渝軍各軍事施設後，復於二十七日截獲渝軍山砲二門，重機槍二挺，步槍一〇一枝，機關砲彈二一二四發。目前已突破省境至峽關臨洪西南二十公里轉向晋省內猛攻渝軍殘部中。</p>
<p>北京二十八日中央社電　駐華派遣軍岡村最高指揮官親察此次擊滅渝第二十四集團軍之作戰狀况，曾於二十六日搭機飛赴某地，聽取日軍某部隊長之戰况報吿，二十七日復在機上巡視陵川方面作戰狀况，於當日傍晚始飛返此間。</p>
<h3>孫殿英談話</h3>

<h3>協約國對太平洋戰略　各自爲謀意見紛歧　英國高戰歐洲重點主義　對澳呼籲援助置諸不問</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　自反軸心軍，在西南太平洋屢戰屢敗後，澳洲政府，即曾迭决要請增派援軍，同時渝方亦因英軍在阿拉坎之敗退，即動員大公報及其他機關報等，屢决呼籲，力言東亞反攻之必要，故謂歐洲重點主義之加薩白朗加方式，現已成爲反軸心陣營爭論之焦點。駐倫敦澳洲高等事務官布魯斯，近於新西蘭軍紀念日出席澳洲記者團主辦之午餐會時，曾就此問題，表明澳洲之立塲，而倫敦泰晤士報，亦即於翌日之社論中，針對布魯斯演說，高唱歐洲重點主義。故反軸心陣營之對立，於此可見一斑，布魯斯之演詞，大意謂，新嘉坡陷落後之澳洲處境與與法國陷落後之英國處境相同，一九四二年初，澳洲及西蘭太平洋反軸心國之平等立塲，遭遇知何迫切之危機，實未爲英國所能充分明瞭。日本參戰後，迄今一年有餘，澳洲因困於人力不足，如東亞地方戰局已極不利。然澳洲政府因未會撤退留於中東戰綫之澳軍，一九四〇年，澳政府亦曾派遣一師團兵力，開赴馬來半島，大東亞戰爭開始時，澳洲所有之空軍實丈，至爲薄弱，目無一架爲近代軍用機，前决大戰時澳洲之空軍人員，不過六百人，今則已達十萬人，澳洲可用之商船噸數之中百分之二十五，已不得不爲應英本國之絕對需要，而從事運鋼鐵赴美，二十四歲至六十五歲之澳洲男子二百五十萬人內，其五十萬人，已均爲軍務而勳員，倘以同一比率計逄，則足當英本國徵用四百五十萬人，美國徵用四百萬人。一九三九年之澳洲軍需生產，固不足道，是則戰車裝甲車以及作戰用之軍用機等主要武器，更無不生產。關於馬來半島及新嘉坡英政府，曾於以安心保證，然結果適得其反，澳政府鑒於該方面英海軍要能充分增援，亦曾指出有增强空軍之必要，但此項意見，並未見容於英政府，徵諸其後之經過，當時吾人之犧牲縱大，亦　阻止日軍佔領其現在國領之地帶，在此日軍佔領地帶，其主要生產有橡皮，有煤油，有錫，且有更重要之金鷄納霜，而今日此等資源，必被日軍所充分享用，反軸心軍之不能染指，已爲確定之事實云云。以上布魯斯之演說，已明白抨擊英國之自私，而英國泰晤士報則亦於社論中，發表其自私之見解，指出不能向太平洋派遣援軍之理由，尤其對於渝方更拋棄向來之口頭援助，公然宣稱無力援助，大意謂，北非戰綫遠征軍，於登陸之時，需用二萬噸護衛完善之商船隊，且爲維持接濟登陸作戰之部隊，允需十萬噸之船舶，故即使反軸心軍能允許派遣　　同等兵力赴太平洋，然就現狀而言，此項軍隊，欲由海上運輸，事實之不可能，實至顯然。英國除男女補助部隊外，所動員之兵力已，達九百萬人，美國則達一千萬或一千一百萬人，如歐洲戰局吿一段落，則英美兩國之軍隊，至少亦將達二千萬人口，反軸心雖有如此龐大兵力，然實際上，即向太平洋派遺五百萬人口，尙不可能，况對日軍作戰全要者爲空戰及海戰，故以增强空軍部隊爲最感必要，似無須更向太平洋派遣如上所述之大軍。又渝方自一九三七年三月起，即與日軍開始戰事，故認當盎格路撒克遞各國參戰之時，必將得到英美援助，然太平洋戰爭勃發以來，已將年半猶仍飽嘗失政及幻想之悲哀。然目擊英美兩國之困難立塲，即可完全明瞭此項困難，並非無理，但反軸心軍於困苦經歷中，所得之結果，亦深悟除集中全力於最重要戰塲之外，更難獲得其他較好之戰略。英國爲完成遠難本國八千里處之大規模作戰，其人力確不充足，况德國於距多維爾二十哩之地上，仍在虎視耽耽中，故於繞過地球攻擊日本之前，首應打倒德軍者，自屬必然。</p>

<h3>怎樣加強中滿團結　—周佛海在新京廣播演詞</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　我國訪滿特使周佛海於四月十二日曾在新京發表廣播演說，題爲「怎樣加强中滿團結」？茲誌原詞如下：「滿洲國國民諸君：我有機會得向諸君發表一點個人的觀感和意見，心中非常快慰，非常興奮，在沒有來到貴國以前，已經聽說滿洲國近年來的建設，突飛猛進，無論政治，經濟，軍事，文化各方面，都有飛躍的進步，良好的成績。及至踏進貴國的國境，看到社會的安定，治安的確立，生產的進步，敎育的擴展，使我對於當政諸公的卓見和毅力，國民諸君的堅苦和協力，發生無限的欽佩。同時使我十分高興的就是在東亞軸心中已有滿洲國一個强有力的伙伴。滿洲國的富强，就是東亞軸心的富强，，東亞軸心的强大，就可以決定大爽亞戰爭的勝利，就可以象徵大東亞前途的光明。亞洲大陸上的中滿兩國能够日益强大，就足以協助友邦日本很快的完成大東亞戰爭的勝利，很快的進行東亞共榮的建設。我這一次來訪問貴國，一在考察貴國十年以來經濟建設的實况，一在增進中滿兩國的友好，加强中滿兩國的團結。中滿兩國在地理上歷史上經濟上文化上，甚至於兩國國民的日常生活上，都有不可分離的密切關係；因爲中滿兩國的國情旣然這樣相同，所以貴國在經濟建設上所用的方法，所使的技術，自然可以給中國作參考，作模範。本人這一决來訪貴國，是想盡可能的考察貴國旣有的建設成績，並與貴國各界賢達開誠談商，以作中國經濟建設的借鏡；因爲中國無論就完遂大東亞戰爭勝利談，或就戰後的建設談，都非勵行經濟建設不可。中國的國力如果不富，民力如果不强，就是東亞軸心缺少有力的一環，這樣對於東亞軸心的確立，東亞建設的進行，都有不利的影響。我們認定中國的需要，同時也是東亞的需要，故舉全國之力量，進行經濟建設。在這一點上，我們熱力的希望貴國及友邦日本能盡可能的給我們以較大較多的援助。</p>
<p>其决要說的是怎樣增進中滿兩國的友好，加强中滿兩國的團結。中滿兩國自從中日滿三國共同宣言發表後，中滿兩國即恢復本然的友好，確立中滿兩國的親善關係。自從前年十二月八日友邦日本發動大東亞戰爭，揭起建設東亞共榮圈的大旗，同是東亞軸心中一份子的中國和滿洲國的責任，都因着大東亞戰爭發生而加大加重。今年一月九日，中華民國毅然參戰，與友邦日本同生共死，中國對東亞應負的責任，應袒的工作，較前更重更多。滿洲國是東亞軸心的一環，在東亞所負的責任與工作，同中日兩國沒有兩樣，尤其是這一次大東亞戰爭，不僅是以戰爭驅逐英美在亞的惡勢力，更要經過這一次戰爭之後，作東亞建設成東亞人共享的樂土。所以我常說大東亞戰爭不只是戰爭，我們要一面戰爭，一面建設；沒有戰爭不能掃除建設的障碍，沒有建設，不足以進行持久的大東亞戰爭，更不足以確保大東亞戰爭的勝利，我們需要積極的建設，不斷的建設，才能使東亞成爲東亞人共榮的樂土，共存的新天地，至於獲得戰爭　勝利，進行持久的建設，都需要力量，力量從什麽地方產生，就產生於中日滿的堅固團結，我來訪問貴國的任務之一，就是怎樣使已有的友好增進，使旣有的團結加强。中滿的團結加强，即是共同的力量增大，然後才可以有效的協助友邦日本獲得大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>加强團結可以說是我們的共同要求，用什麽方法才能達到加强團結的目的呢？我覺得第一要精神團結。精神團結的基礎，也可以說是原則，就是自愛其國，互愛其隣，共愛東亞，中滿兩國民必需有自愛愛人的決心，才能達到眞正的精神團結。這個團結是以道義爲基礎，以大家自由平等爲目的，正如中日滿共同宣言所說：「希望三國互相尊重其本然之特質，於東亞建設以道義爲基礎之新秩序之共同理想下，互爲善隣緊密之提携，俾形成東亞永久和平之軸心，並希望以此爲核心而貢獻於世界全體之和平」。這樣以道義爲基礎的精神團結，是實現東亞共榮，建設東亞共榮圈不可缺少的原則和方法；這正與英美以功利爲基礎而實行的利害結合相反，譬如從前英美以帝國主義的勢力壓迫東亞人，榨取東亞人，那時他們也是以假仁假義的言詞，向東亞人講人道與和平，其實他們是想在人道與和平的假面具下，减除榨取東亞的反抗，消滅東亞人因反抗壓迫而發生的鬥爭。現在大多數的東亞人都覺悟了，都感覺到與惟利是圖的英美人講人道說和平，無異東手就擒，坐以待斃。所以都起來追隨友邦日本之後，參加打倒英美的鬥爭，或希望中滿兩國要實行的精神團結，便是以道義爲基礎的團結，以自愛其國，互愛其隣爲團結的起點，以此團結的方法，達共愛東亞共同團結的目的。只有這種精神上的結合，才是眞正的永久的結合，才能發揮共同的力量，才能維持永久的友好關係。</p>
<p>精神團結之外，第二就是經濟團結。中滿兩國國土相連。很久以來，經濟上就是有無相通，現在同是東亞軸心的一員，同是建設東亞共榮圈的伙伴，當然要使有無相通，長短相補的經濟關係，更加密切，更加圓滑。今後中國要以多餘物產供給滿洲國的不足，同時希望滿洲國也是如此。兩國不僅在物產上要以有易無，以長補短，並要能更進一些玲生產上，貿易上形成澈底的合作，達到經濟團結的目的。果能如此，受到利益的不僅是中滿及友邦日本，在東亞的各國家，各民族及歐洲各友邦都可因中滿兩國的經濟團結而獲得很大的利益。這種經濟團結的工作，自然是複雜困難，不可一蹴而致，希望中滿以及友邦日本的才智之士，能多貢獻意見，多研究方法，使中滿兩國的關係，因經濟團結實行而益强其密切。如果如此，東亞軸心也可隨着强大，我們貢獻給大東亞戰爭亦必較現在爲多。除精神團結經濟團結的方法以外，就是文化團結。一個國家有一個國家的特殊風俗習慣，文物制度，也就是一國有一國的文化。所以在國與國之間，實行文化團結，文化融合，比較困難，但是這個困難在中滿兩國都是沒有的，因爲中滿兩國已有悠久的歷史關係及長期的種族混合，造成兩國的共同文化，如果能由這一點加以發揮，加以光大，則中滿兩國不僅是相互的溝通文化，將是共同的發揮文化，而且是共同發揮同一文化。同文同種已足促成國家間的緊密團結，相同的文化更容易融合兩國國民的關係和情感，使團結越鞏固，友好越增進。</p>
<p>以上所談的不外是增淮團結的方法，我這一次訪問貴國的目的，就是希望實行這些方法，來增進親善，加强團結；而現時正在進行的大東亞戰爭，關係東亞各民族各國家的生死存亡，不容我們不加强團結；而且未來更有建設東亞共榮圈的偉大工作，更需要加强團結，而且要造成永久的團結。團結愈堅固，建設東亞的力量愈强大，建設東亞的力量愈强大，大東亞的共存共榮實現的日期就愈快，中滿及東亞各國家的國民爲復與自己的國家，固然需要團結鄰國；爲保衛東亞繁榮東亞，更需要加强彼此的團結。只要東亞各國家各民族能成爲鐵一般堅固的團結，就可產生火一樣熱的力，惟有這種力量，才可以毀滅英美支配的舊勢力，創造各國家各民族各得其所的東亞新秩序」。</p>

<h3>反軸心陣綫遭遇重大裂痕　英波首要協謀對策　傳英贊同蘇立塲要求波內閣改組　蘇或將以在蘇波人組織自由波軍</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　蘇聯政府於宜佈與波蘭亡命政府絕交時，因事前並未照會英美等國，故莫斯科廣播該事時，反軸心各國均甚表驚異。英政府亦即與美政政府局協議，決定從中調停。又波蘭亡命政府於二十七日上午，召開緊急閣議，協議對策，閣議後並未發表任何聲明，僅謂「巳發生新事態」云。又二十七日下午波蘭總理薛柯斯基，及外長拉英斯基，分別訪問英首相邱吉爾，及外相艾登，四人繼又在首相官邸協議。同時美駐英大使章南特，亦會與邱吉爾會談，頃據可靠方面消息，邱吉爾在英波首腦會談席上，會指出反軸心國間已遭重大危機，並竭力主張統一戰綫，要求波蘭亡命政府自重。邱吉爾於會談完畢後，復將該會談之決定事項，報吿蘇駐英大使邁斯基。衆認邱吉爾此後，似將採取第二步之措置，並認英波兩政府，或將在本日發表聲明。父路透社亦跟力宣傳英政府從中之調停，蘇波關係已稍見緩和。據路透社電稱，二十六日莫斯科之德語新聞報吿，會謂蘇波兩國斷絕國交，然至二十七日夜，則已將「斷絕」兩宇，改爲「停止」，並謂波蘭現尙未正式決定撤退駐蘇大使云。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據傳波蘭亡命政府於二十七日上午，會召開閣議，議決聲明書，並由波外部提交英外相，衆認英政府爲緩和反軸心陣營之危機，將要求再組波蘭亡命政府之內閣，並罷免反蘇之國家主義者。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，據瑞典報紙接獲英京消息，英國有資格方面，自蘇波絕交後，並未會作左右袒護，波蘭方面似無其他辦法，唯有組織新政府，冀與莫斯科復交，並作相當讓步，以冀對於兩國間懸而未決之各項土地問題，獲致協定，英國方面，雖顯然不欲左袒任何一方，免使業已嚴重之局勢，更加嚴重，但倫敦政府似欲依照「强者常有理」之原則，贊同莫斯科之立塲。更有値得注意者，蘇波絕交前一日，捷克總統貝奈斯，尙在無綫電廣播稱「捷克信賴英蘇關係之團結。」</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據莫期科美聯社電訊，蘇聨與倫敦波蘭亡命政權斷絕外交關係之後，所有波蘭在蘇境之利益，將由何國代爲保管，蘇方尙未獲有任何消息云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　美聯社駐華盛頓訪員聲稱，昨日美京政界人十發表意見，認爲莫斯科方面之決定與倫敦波蘭亡命政權斷絕關係，可暗示史太林希望英美正式承認反軸心勝利之日，蘇聯有割據西部邊境若干領土之權利，且蘇聯現正企圖壓迫英美，使其在歐陸開闢弟二戰綫云。美京若干人士甚有謂蘇波之絕交，爲英相邱吉爾之外交上失敗者，謂邱氏對波蘭亡命政權，應採取一種更現實之態度，該訪員相信蘇聯或將以蘇境之波蘭人，組織「自由波軍」，並宜布祇有願加入紅軍作解放波蘭戰爭之波人，有重返波蘭之權利云。</p>
<h3>蘇波決裂事美感不安　赫爾對該案尙無表示</h3>
<p>阿京二十八日中央社電　華盛頓外交界對蘇波斷絕國交，深感不安，因兩國均爲所謂協約國之會員國國務院對比表示惋惜，惟因眯於該案實情，故對蘇波齟齬之性質，絕不提及。昨在新聞訊者席上，有人以倫敦方面傳來英美將出仟調停之說，詢諸國務卿赫爾，渠答謂，該案未會確切發展前，不使多所論列，但一俟情勢發展，國務院即當有所聲明。波蘭大使喜詹諾伏斯基，與副國務卿威爾斯會談後，吿新聞記者謂，渠尙未接獲蘇聯行動之官塲證實消息，是以不能有所評論。據有資格政治觀察家之揣測，則該案之第二步驟，將爲美國採取彼時美蘇兩國之基本異見，將益趨月朗，觀察家謂英首相艾登之態度，在此時此景，頗屬耐人尋味，蓋艾氏如袒護蘇聯，則許多被軸心國佔據之國家的政府，勢將振臂一呼，起而與反軸心連營奮鬥，艾氏將感應付不了。觀察家續謂，蘇皮協定，事實上旣吿無效，則英蘇協定，是否亦將步其後塵，自屬疑問。按蘇波決裂，早於二月間開始醞釀，蓋彼時莫斯科當局，曾吿外籍記者謂，一九三九至四〇年併入蘇俄版圖之東歐某數地區，決無交還之可能。及二月底，波蘭流亡政府官謂波蘭之邊界，當以在一九三九年九月間波軍獨當德方攻勢之地區爲標準。然蘇波齟齬之近因，當爲波政府請求國際紅十字會，調查德方所傳蘇軍在斯摩倫克附近謀害波方俘虜之重大案件，蘇方則答謂該項謠言，顯爲希特勒派所揑造，蓋殺波方軍官者，均爲納粹黨人，德方正從事宣傳，冀蘇聯與其同盟國間發生異見，波政府不察，已墮其術中云。同時美國各界，深懼關於居住蘇聯國土之波僑數千名的法律地位，將發生嚴重糾紛云。</p>
<h3>德外部評論蘇波事件　係整個反軸心間羞恥</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德外交部昨日謂蘇聯政府與倫敦波蘭流亡政府間之最近事件，乃整個反軸心陣綫間之羞恥。此事足以表明英國絕無機會可運用其勢力，以阻遏蘇聯之土地要求。英方對蘇波絕交事之評論，已可認爲英政府之無能力對於蘇聯之政策，實行其意旨云。德外交部國際政治發言人，昨日招待報界時，首先宣讀蘇外長莫洛托夫之絕交牒文，發言人綜合德方對此項發展之評論稱，「史太林巳與波蘭絕交，因渠不欲波蘭駐蘇大使留駐而提出不愉快之問題，波大使曾提出關於培坦森林謀殺案，及關於被蘇聯移去之波人一百五十萬人之踪跡等使蘇聯極不愉快之問題」。發言人又稱，在德軍手中之波蘭戰俘六十九萬四千人，現仍生存，但在蘇聯手中之一百五十萬波人之命運，則無人能確知之。德方之意見，以爲史太林之與波蘭絕交，實並欲使英美得知其不欲與聞英美對於土地問題之討論，史太林仍視波蘭爲位於蘇聯軍事邊界內之國家，史太林對蘇柯爾斯基將軍之態度，已表明其不欲參與足以改變此種情形之任何協定，發言人提及蘇聯方面所稱，德國與蘇柯爾斯基將軍合作時，謂余實無適當之字句以否認此種在妄之言，歐洲之許多國家及民族曁有些中立國等，皆當以波蘭爲鑑，並應明瞭，唯有德國及其盟國之武器戰鬥勝利，方能保歐洲各國家及各民族免於在蘇聯之手中遭遇與波蘭同樣之命運。英國對於聲望之問題，尙不能爲力，則謂其能制止蘇聯之過份進入歐洲境內，又烏足信。</p>
<h3>巴拉特角以東　猛烈戰繼續進行　英軍向突尼斯作突破企圖</h3>
<p>柏林廿八日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派昌訊，突尼西亞橋頭堡之爭奪戰，現仍繼續，其劇烈之程度，時有漲落，此因大戰之特微。星期一晨西綫全部皆有猛烈之戰鬥，但自下午至晚間，則戰鬥顯然稍爲和緩，星期二戰鬥又呈活躍，數决地區之戰鬥漸趨猛烈，尤其是在巴拉特角以東之海岸地帶，該處之安特森將軍，以法軍之混合部隊作戰，美軍在賽特傑南及具加通向東面及北面之各公路上攻擊，反軸心方面所傳美軍砲隊業已向瑪特爾之德軍陣地開火一說，尙屬言之稍早。星期一美軍尙未抵達西迪西爾之車站。美第二軍之作戰計劃，或係除對西迪西爾作正面攻擊外，並將轉斾南向梅傑茲挨爾巳勃至德包爾巴之公路或向該路之山脈攻擊。在過去數日間，英軍部隊亦自南方及東南方向此項山嶺陣地作多决攻擊，獲有多少進展，現尙未知，該山脈必尙有一重要部份，仍在德軍手中，否則英軍必向德包爾巴方面獲有更大之進展，稍進而南，英軍之坦克車隊於星期六推進幾達彭杜法斯，但於星期日遭德軍擊退，並蒙重大之損失，其殘部巳在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃南之地區及古貝拉特之雨面，重行編配，並有重要之步兵隊補充增加。在傑具爾安格及傑貝爾曼蘇爾之間，作戰之安特森將軍所部中路，在復活節假期中，雖受有重大損失，但仍擁有巨大之打擊力及優越之數目，此項準備，大部爲英軍之精銳部隊，單就英弟一軍之中路而言，已有軍隊的九師之衆，英軍或將再向彭杜法斯傑貝爾柴格霍安，或直接經中德巴爾巴，而向突尼斯作突破之冀圖，此項冀圖，將與軸心軍在星期日所擊退者同等猛烈，德軍於復活節假期中，雖能順利防守，但尙未能謂戰局之繁張，業已緩弛英第八軍在節期中，雖頗爲沉靜，但必係利用此時問，以在各方面增强其戰鬥力，在未來之作戰中，仍將佔重要之地位。蒙高茂萊將軍於星期日，僅在恩斐達維爾及達加魯納間之地區作局部攻擊，其目的係在軸心軍所固守之山脈中，奪取數處山峯，在過去數日間，蒙高茂萊將軍，巳重編其部隊，並或將以其主力偏重於左面側翼。軸心斥堠隊報吿謂，强大之英美坦克車隊，大量集中於傑比比納地區，此或即表明蒙高茂萊將軍，或將冀圖向西北面望彭杜法斯突破，以與第一軍之中路合作。</p>

<p>瑞典京二十八日中央社電　東綫庫班河口地區之戰事，德羅軍巳確立勝利態勢，蘇軍蒙創頗鉅，有不能復起之勢。近數日中陸上巳無大規模戰鬥，僅有小規模之空戰。但列寗格勒地區之德軍，突於二十六日下午在某地開始反攻，深入蘇軍陣地，使蘇軍不得巳而撤退，蘇軍爲奪回此陣地，曾於二十七日兩度反攻，但均爲德猛烈砲火所擊退。又列寗格勒周圍之德軍，曾於二十七砌擊市內之重要軍事設施，收獲重大效果。此外德空軍以庫彭河地區爲中心，展開之攻勢，已日益熾烈，二十七日，蘇新聞報亦曾稱，德空軍曾自刻赤半及達曼半島，反覆轟炸。克拉斯諾達市之蘇軍，刻正急請調派大批戰鬥機增援。</p>

<h3>歐洲「第二戰線」概觀</h3>
<p>（里斯本十六日茂本特派員發）隨着突尼西亞戰事的緊急，歐洲戰局終於進入了重大時期。最近希特勒和墨索里尼兩巨頭會談，可視爲是商量如何適處關於突尼西亞戰綫所能發生的一切情勢之準備的。英美方面也以爲向歐洲大陸登陸的機會，終於成熟，而虎視眈眈。英美的歐洲大陸攻勢，可視爲有向意大利，即西西里或撤丁島展開的模樣，也可預想如有向克里特，希臘，或黑海沿岸展開的模樣。然而無論如何，必將到來的歐洲戰局的新階段，其中心在於東部戰綫，及於此相關之英美第二戰綫問題的如何：因之，軸心方面的對策，其主要的努力，也是緊對着這二者的。前者暫置不論，後者如英美所豪語，假定是在最近的將來可以發生的，然則可視爲第二戰綫的候補地之各國，具備着怎樣的情勢呢？現在作一槪觀於下：</p>
<p>（一）巴爾幹方面</p>
<p>軸心方面的情報，頻頻傳着塞普羅期島上英美軍的攻勢準備。一方面來自安哥拉的情報，亦稱軸心方面最所重視的是巴爾幹，最近以德軍，匈牙利軍，羅馬尼亞軍，編成特別空軍部隊，預定從新以的○師配置於巴爾幹，正謀强化對付　美軍登　的對策；但未認德國　　　　回巴爾幹方面移動的事實，僅謂空軍被送往保加利亞，砲兵隊正在向黑海並愛琴海沿岸集中而巳。英國方面則認爲克里特島集有○師，此外在希臘沿岸各港，保加利亞的黑海　岸等處，亦有相當强力的防備。</p>
<p>自前决希特勒元首和保加利亞國王波利期三世會談以來，保加利亞的動向，極被注目，然該國依然爲了防衛巴爾幹，並未變更其協力於軸心的方針。</p>
<p>德蘇開戰以後，德國把希臘的支配，委諸意國，自己則專致力於東部戰綫，然而最近數月以來，德國已担當着海岸防衛，意軍則大體担當着希臘內部。又關於反軸心的希臘游擊軍，其在馬凱得尼亞方面爲德烏拉斯少校所指揮者，最爲有力，屢屢向保加利亞軍挑戰，據說他們和南斯拉夫的反軸心游擊軍米海洛維契軍之間，甚至設有連絡將校。此外尙有希臘軍，散布於品特斯，奧利姆普斯，斯巴爾脫北部，以及、克里特島等處，總計約有三萬的武裝兵，據說還有設立統一的參謀部之計畫。</p>
<p>舊南斯拉夫方面，爲米海洛維契軍，游擊軍，共產黨游擊隊等的巢穴，情勞最爲錯綜複雜。</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞亦有相當的反軸心遊擊隊暗中活躍，最近亦傳有襲擊意軍的事件。又傳意國最近已更迭總督，樹立了號稱「大阿雨巴尼亞防衛團」的新黨，一方面更編成阿爾巴尼亞人的自衛軍，正在鞏固阿爾巴尼亞的防衛新體制。</p>
<p>隨着北非戰局的進展，意國沿岸的防衛，特被强化，英美雖嚷着要乘機對意作戰，然而作戰上的困難，他們也充分知道着。</p>
<p>（二）意大利沿岸及法蘭西海岸　由於突尼西亞戰局的緊急，被祝爲最重要的，爲意大利沿岸及撤丁和西西里兩島的防備。最近希特勒和墨索里尼兩巨頭的會談，可視爲將以强化意大利的防衛爲中心論題的。一方面，英美力謀攪亂意大利的人心，加緊離間德意，然而他們畢竟感嗼着意大利國內沒有可乘的反法西斯的勢力。</p>
<p>法蘭西的防衛，以隆特休鐵特將軍爲最高司令官，至於羅命的國境地帶，則屬於比利時佔領軍當局管轄。降特休鐵特將軍，以担當英法海峽並希斯凱灣沿岸，地中海沿岸的防備爲主。行政方面，全國在德官憲監督之下，形式上則由法國官吏施行。然自　軍運駐以來，佔領和非佔領地帶的區別已消滅，不過政治的差異，依然留存，德軍亦尊重之。現在進駐南法的德意軍，稱爲作戰軍，不稱爲佔領軍。</p>
<p>和第二戰綫相關，在北法海岸最重要的，是鄧寇克至聖那才爾一帶之英法海峽沿岸，德國現在正舉全力，鞏固防備登陸的堡壘，據說其防備自海岸至內地，深達一百二十乃至一百五十英里，整備着在英美軍登陸時，可以立即出動邀擊的態勢。</p>
<p>在地中海沿岸，自納爾本奴至蒙貝利埃間的五十哩的海岸，被認爲是最危險的，這個地方的居民，據說已全部被命令撤離，並傳馬賽，都隆兩港的防備，特被强化。關於國內情形，英國方面難加以任意的臆測，可是反德勢力，全然沒有組織。</p>
<p>例如英國報紙也這樣承認：「因爲他們嫌惡德國人，便說他們歡喜英美人，那是不對的，因此縱令英美軍登陸，法蘭西人也不會自動地來做英美之友的」。這話爲去年狄埃浦登陸所證明。又在叙利亞，馬達加斯加，北非等處之法人對英美軍的抵抗，都險法海軍的自炸，亞力山大利西法艦除的拒絕與反軸心合併等，都是明白的觀念。</p>
<p>（三）荷蘭，比利時</p>
<p>德意志日報，關於德軍在荷蘭，比利時的防綫設施，報道如次：「德軍爲設置保堡壘，地雷原，戰車壕等，巳拆除了海岸一帶的民房，故縱令英美軍登陸，也不能利用任何遮蔽物」。據說海牙海岸一帶的居民，已奉令撤離，民房，道路，都差不多不留片跡。自北荷至夫爾新之來因，馬斯　斯刻爾特三河的三角洲地方，據說防備最爲嚴密。駐在荷蘭之德國方面的民政長官，爲蔡斯殷嘉特氏，最初係採取軍事佔領的形式，但最近巳把行政上的全權，集中於該氏一手。</p>
<p>比利時海岸的德軍防備，亦不下於荷蘭，遂漸被强化着。海岸的居民，均被禁止外出至三哩以上，防備綫的縱深，愈益延長，禁止區域已擴大自海岸二十哩至塞爾柴鐵。又據說納米由爾，里埃求等的舊要塞，已完全恢復，薩姆布爾，。德軍佔領地行政，與荷蘭不同，由隆特休鐵特元帥麾下之哈爾根霍森將軍直接司理軍政。</p>
<p>（四）挪威，丹麥</p>
<p>前年美軍進駐冰島，英美的目光，早已集注於挪戚，因之，德國强化該國的防備，也較之其他佔領地，更早着手。奧斯洛，斯達完格，卑爾根，納爾維克等諸都市的海岸地帶，特別嚴重。尤其是至內地，據說已自馬奇諾防綫移來大砲及其他武器，築成了與齊格菲爾特防綫相匹敵的堅壘。民政長官爲道地的納粹黨員的瑟夫，鐵爾波夫思氏，而由著名的基斯林少校爲首領之國家聯合黨協助之，該黨有黨員的四萬，擁有稱爲希爾德黨的軍隊數千。</p>
<p>丹麥除本土求特蘭之外，在其五百餘的島嶼中，最重要的爲西蘭及芬寧兩島。德軍在求特蘭的，的有○萬，在西蘭島的的有〇萬，在芬寧島的的有○萬。德軍的最高司令官爲去年十月任命之哈耐根將軍。民政方面，則由駐哥本哈根的公使威爾那，貝斯特氏，以丹麥政府的顧問資格，担任指導。</p>
<p>德國對於丹麥的方針。在於使該國成爲新秩序的模範，故與其他佔領地異，務使實現丹麥人的自治而努力着。丹麥的親德派代表，爲現任首相挨利克。斯加威紐斯氏。（丁：譯自四月十九日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>市民福利正解</h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>申報日前載楊君郁生所撰「保富法應用的商榷」一文，當因聶雲台先先所撰之保富法，而推闈補充其意義，惟文中兩引鄙人演講市民福利之大意，並多溢美之詞，實非所敢承，鄙人演詞，無非從正當之福利，促市民之認識，故有「無禍即福無害即利」之結論，此皆老生常談而已。就福字言之，四書除孟子引詩「自求多福一外，絕無此字，最顯明者惟尙書九五福一語，所謂五福者，一曰壽，人之年齡，究至何時，始可稱壽，依俗例，非六十花甲，不應爲壽。且生命之壽，與名譽之壽，並無分別，是以顏回之三十二亦壽，盜跖之大年亦非壽，今有三十四十做壽者，豈非以三十四十爲滿足，而就此而止耶？二曰富，富不獨指金錢而言，讀書多則學問富，朋友善則情感富，圖書足則收藏富，子孫賢則人口富，若但知爲守財奴，世之公卿降爲皂隸，巨室鞠爲茂草者，亦得謂之福乎！三曰康寗固以無災無病爲極樂，然手足健而懶於動作，體骨强而習於鬥狠，必至禍息叢生，有同廢物。四曰攸好德，好德何以列入五福，實有妙理存焉。譬如救濟貧病，我有力爲之，即我之有福，反之即我之無福，世之力足以助人，而棄之不顧者，是不啻自絕於福也。五曰老終命，人之不得善終者，厥有二端，其一遭禍，含寃受屈而死是。其二闖禍，爲非作歹而死是，皆不得稱之爲福，固矣；然如文天祥史可法，一則被殺，一則自殺，因其出於自願，且身雖死而流芳千古，其名不朽，較諸考終命者，其福爲尤大允久。更就利字言之，孔子罕言利，孟子曰：「何必曰利，亦有仁義而已矣」！孔孟何以蔑視利，則以利有廣狹二錢：狹義之利，謂之利已，廣義之利，人已兩利；况利之本質，隨人之立塲而異，士以修業爲利，農以豐收爲利，工以製造爲利，商以貿遷爲利，故孔子日：「因民之所利而利之』。譬如乞丐一日而得十金，其他不及十金之乞丐，必以彼爲大利，然使巨商日獲多金者視之，則十金不値其一盼耳。世人不自量力，忘其本分，而食得無厭，其亦知所返矣。以上摘錄鄙人演詞之一節，藉以質諸讀者。</p>

<h3>米糧燃料採取配給制後　滬市生活漸趨平穏狀態　整個情形已無動盪不安之象</h3>
<p>消息靈通方面，以爲本市食糧及燃料兩者，自經各當局採取配給制度後，整個情形，已由動盪而歸安定，其供給量迄無任何匱乏之跡象，非特來源蟬聯，存底充沛，抑且售價頻頻下落，刻已呈現平穩狀態。</p>
<p>每月耗米十一萬包</p>
<p>上海社記者昨自關係方面探悉，兩租界當局辦理計口授糧，刻已屆第三十三期，總計售出整米碎米，約達一百十七萬餘包之語。惟自昨年九月廿一日起，戶口米發售，則改爲每十日一次，若以每人每期授米二升計算，兩租界每月食米消耗量的計十四萬石，合十一萬餘包。近今米糧已可自由搬運，額外供應量激增，市况已極度安定，且市民因慣於攙食雜糧，對添購食米，已無過去殷繁。</p>
<p>燃料供應當可持久</p>
<p>關於居民等　每日炊煮所需之燃料，如煤觔·柴炭等，及各業工廠之所需烟煤，早經當局按期充分配給，故買賣情形，顯然逈異往者。現當局除積極疏通來源，設法增加存底，並充分配給各用戶，今後燃料供應，無虞匱乏。今燃料圈體組織機構已有調整，預料此後市况，當可持久安定。</p>
<h3>廣田情報部長　發表談話　軸心國今後作戰之進展</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，於昨（二十八）日下午三時，在華懋飯店八樓招待本市中國新聞記者團常奮席上，發表觀測世界情勢，及今後軸心之活潑進展。</p>
<p>敗績原因</p>
<p>廣田情報部長首述世界戰勢，特別注意北非突尼斯，「當德蘇正在酣戰中，最近突發生蘇聯與波蘭斷絕國交，在世界戰勢全體上說，雖吿發展，而太平洋戰果及將來之發展，允須特別注意，就最近大東亞作戰情勢之觀測，緬甸及印度之戰况已吿發展，日軍由印緬進迫英軍，而南方之新幾內亞及所羅門各島嶼，早爲日空軍听控制，予美海軍以重大威脅。旋廣田部長論敵國情勢稱，英在印緬之戰敗，英美渝聯合軍總司令華維爾將軍曾說明敗績原因，由於天氣之不良，及英軍患疲疾者衆多。而在南太平洋之作戰，日軍迭獲戰果，予澳洲以重大威脅，澳英美聯合軍總司令麥克沃賽將軍及布烈米將軍，澳總理寇丁，愛勃脫外交部長四人，曾聯合呼籲要求美積極予以援助，保衛澳洲，否則將受日重大襲擊。</p>
<p>謬訓見解</p>
<p>繼謂我人以英美目前形勢而觀，英美在太平洋之防禦地位，非但未見加强，抑且情勢愈呈惡劣，吾人可在反軸心國作戰指迫部之標榜所謂全球作戰之方針，暴露無意强化太平洋防禦，謂全球作戰俟歐洲戰事先行解決後，始解決太平洋戰事，企圖以全力作戰獲取勝利，此點殊爲最大之謬誤，因協約國之未能認淸作戰之現實，而輕視軸心，但在吾人之觀測，殊不以爲然，如英美能以全力作戰，實爲予軸心國以良好之機會，以逸待勞，予以迎頭痛擊，屆時協約陣綫全部崩潰，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>控制弱點</p>
<p>反軸心之最大錯誤，即在以紙上談兵自豪，目相互顧忌，然在軸心陣綫則不然，如果右翼歐洲戰略遭受控制時，左冀日本當起立援助，排除萬難，此乃兵法之常道，免遭協約國各個擊破之危機，以是協約之陣容，瀕爲分裂狀態。此外在軍備上。弊病百出，弱點暴露無遺，先以在南太平洋明白表現，如印度澳洲渝方三處，吾人爲按照兵法之常道及日德義同盟之義務，一致爲控制協約弱點，紛起作戰，故在春夏之期間中，當有活潑之發展，此點乃可斷言者」云。</p>
<h3>體育　華人混合足球隊　今戰聖友隊　下午五時在徐滙</h3>
<p>上海華人混合足球隊，爲遠征華北，特的西人勁旅聖友隊作練習賽，原定日前舉行，，因雨展期至今日下午五時在徐家滙徐匯中學球塲交鋒，裁判何春照巡邏員張樂陳吉祥，華人混合集東華聯誼之精華，擁有世運代表李天生·賈幼良，以及港滬首流名將劉顯漢·李寗·莊胡仁·張林根·宋靈聖·瞿永福·戴麟經·李義臣·韓龍海·吳祺祥等，人材濟濟，陣容整齊，不啻爲變相之華聯隊，而聖友亦非弱者可比，麾下頗多驍勇善鬥之士，如福恩·卡洛列區·許而茲等，均馳興球壇，雙雄難遇，定有一塲血戰，門票五元，前日售出之門票，今日通用，</p>
<p>昨日本報發報時間七點四十分</p>
<h3>經濟辦　評言　華股業商復業問題</h3>
<p>華股業商的復業問題，自聞市經濟局辦理各華股行號登記手續，並經頒給一部份股票公司的營業執照以來，大家都以爲這一個懸案的解決，總是指日可期了。可是，消息所傳，日復一日，終於使人望穿秋水，而華商股票市塲迄無正式恢復的確訊。</p>
<p>原來，當局鑒於投機份子的活動，暫時取締華股買賣，以制止不正當的經營，這是一個賢明的措施，而在取締以後，即積極從事於華股行號的審查與登記，藉以促成正當輩股業商的恢業，與正式華商股票市塲的實現，這也是一個賢明的措施。因爲，前者是要防止社會上不正當的投機行爲，後者是要維護社會上正當的投資運動。從事實上說，股票市塲差不多是世界任何一個工商業發達的國家所具備的市塲；從理論上說，現代經濟進化的階段，已經由實物主義時代和貨幣資本主義時代而入於瞭券資本主義時代，因爲證券的持有，即不啻資本或財產的持有。可惜，因爲中國戰前的生產落後以及經濟機構的半殖民地化，以致民族企業和支持民族企業的華商股票，始終未能露其頭角。自大東亞戰爭以來，中國企業界喧濱奪主的局面，爲之一變，於是中國民族企業，方始抬頭，無論銀行，新藥，公用，文化，紗廠，百貨，以及其他實業股票，無不欣欣向榮，幾與戰時的東京股票市塲同其鼎盛。這是民挨企業發達的一個表現，同時也是都市繁榮的一個重要因素。</p>
<p>所以說，當局進行華股行號的審查與登記，以期正式與正當華商股票市塲的成立，期毋因噎而廢食，確爲又一賢明的措施。我們所期望的是一切賢明措施的貫澈，不因一個執行機構中任何一層的阻力，以致不能貫澈其賢明的初衷。</p>
<h3>當局杜絕投機囤麗　監督信託公司業務</h3>
<p>財政部爲杜絕投機囤積起見，自嚴格管理各銀行錢莊業務後，對於各信託公司，決依照信託公司暫行條例予以監督，規定經營業務以下列爲限。（一）財產省理，（二）遺囑執行及遺產管理，（三）信託金之收受及運用，（四）公債公司債股票及其他有價證券之承募或承受，（五）管理公司債及其他股票債劵之擔保品及基金，（六）代理股票債券之登記事項，（七）代理買賣有價證券，（八）代人保管證券票據契約及其他貴重物品，（九）代理房地產經租並介紹房地產之貿賣及抵押，（十）代理房地產過戶登記及納稅，（十一）代理保險，（十二）出出租保管箱及辦理露封原封保管，（十三）辦理淸算及整理事項，（十四）辦理信用保證，（十五）代理收付款項，（十六）其他經財政部核准之信託事項。惟經部特准者得兼營下列附風業務，（一）收受存款，（二）辦理放款，（三）票據貼現，（四）匯兌或押匯，（五）買賣有價證券及不動產，（六）倉庫業。同時規定信託公司不得爲商店或銀行或其他公司之股東，銀行兼營信託業務時，應將信託部與銀行部之資產負債劉分獨立，信託部或銀行部之資產不得因一方之破產而受影響。</p>
<h3>各銀行籌組銀團　辦理農村貸款</h3>
<p>財部當局爲謀農村之復興及物資之增產，決網羅中國，交通，金城，鹽業及其他有力銀行十餘家，以中央儲備銀行爲中心，組織復興農村放款銀團，集中巨款，從事於農村低利貸放，具體方案，正由財部當局擬訂中。茲悉農村貸款，聞規定爲農具，耕牛，靑苗，農倉，以及農村典當等，並以農村合作社爲貸款對象，凡農民收得之農產品如米穀雜糧豆類等，均得向各地農倉堆存，及各行莊申請抵押，農村典當允予接受承質，旨在調劑農業金融，復興整理農村。</p>
<h3>活存準備金　銀錢業請暫緩繳解</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊依照管理金融機關暫行辦法曁施行細則，爲保障存款人利益起見，依法繳解準備金於中央儲備銀行，（一）定期存款及特種活期存款爲百分之五以上，（二）活期存款爲百分之十以上，關於定期存款及特種活期存款雀備金早已繳足，惟活期存款準備金經商妥先解百分之五，其餘之百分之五限四月底繳淸。頃悉銀錢兩業經聯席會議議決，對四底應繳解之百分之五活期存款準備金，鏗會員行莊之要求，際此銀根緊急之時，請予通融暫緩繳解。聞銀錢兩業除派員與中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處接洽外，並聯名呈請財政部准予暫緩繳解。</p>

<p>上海特別市經濟局，爲調整本市不適合戰時經濟機構之舊有各業同業公會，特指定棉花業等十業同業公會發起人，限期召集組織成立，並限令各業公司行號，一律須向各陔業同業公會登記加入爲會員，否則自五月一日起停止營業。</p>

<h3>糧食部撤回　聯營社組織通則</h3>
<p>糧食部爲積極統制全國糧食適合戰時糧食政策起見，曾有糧食聯營社組織通則之頒布，本市米業界人現正着手籌組中，茲悉糧食部以前頒統制糧食聯營社組織通則未見週密，殊不適用。爰特具呈行政院准予撤回外，所有市縣聯營社組織章則，亦重行修改後再行公布，市糧食局業已接奉部方指令，當即轉飭滬市米業公會知照云。</p>
<h3>糧部通令調查　糧食同業公會</h3>
<p>糧食部爲實施戰時糧食政策起見，特通令所團各地糧食局分別調查各該地區經營糧食業之各種同業公會，及其原有各科曁所營糧食種類，詳密具報，以憑核辦，促使各地糧食機構益臻充實及民食憐應得以日趨穩定。</p>
<h3>各業公會近訊</h3>
<p>捲烟火柴皂燭業　本市捲烟火柴皂燭業同業公會，業已籌備就緒，特於昨（二十八）日下午四時半，假市商會大禮堂舉行成立大會，到有王經濟局長等以及同業會員不下五百人，通過會章選舉理監事後，宜告散會。</p>
<p>食油業　上海區食用油業同業公會籌備主任陳子彝等，自奉令辦理籌備同業公會以來積極進行，於昨日（二十八）上午二時在愛多亞路十五號開成立會，到有糧食部紀處長等，當將該公會章程研究修正通過，並選舉陳子彝等十五人爲理事，盧興森等七人爲監事，於四時許散會。</p>

<h3>譯論　當前的金融統制問題</h3>
<p>爲求確立中國的統制經濟，不得不先確立其根本問題的金融統制。現在華中各種經濟問題的癥結。一半都應歸根於金融統制的不澈底，衆皆以爲金融統制如能完成，　當前所成爲問題的各種病症，大半可以解除？</p>
<p>金融統制的三點要務：（一）整理合併小銀行（二）整理銀號及錢莊（三）加强中央儲備銀行的統制力。上開問題，如能合理解決，則今日的囤積居奇，物價高漲，生產不振等等的現象，可减少一半，華中的經濟，比較可當以正常，假如不欲治標而要治本的話，那末國府局應該注重在完成金融統制上。</p>
<p>不過要知道，上面這些問題，初看似乎簡單，其實是言之匪艱，行之維艱的問題。例如小銀行的存在，實在都是憑藉可能使其存在的各種社會上條件所造成，即使用機械式的手段將共合併，亦不能得到合併的實效。因爲問題這樣多難，所以當局實施整理合併金融機關，必須調用能幹人才，方能應付裕如。</p>
<p>整理錢莊銀號，現　有絕對的必要，而且是大衆希望的問題。大東亞戰爭以來，一般錢莊業務，殆已失去正當範圍，尤以軍蔡停止發行新鈔後，已完全喪失其存在理由。是以彼等均在囤積居奇上找尋出路，與銀號同爲華中經濟之癌，故整理錢莊銀號，任何人不會發生異議。但是關於此點，還應該老慮到改業及其他問題。總之，此癌一日不除，一日爲害，願常局深思之。</p>
<p>金融統制的根本問題，我們所萬分切盼於國府當局者；就是加强中央儲備銀行的統制力。設儲備銀行果能在其職權內完成當然任務，則今日之金融界，必得面目一新。希望國府當局與中儲負責人對於此事，多加考慮，庶期金融統制的完璧。（雲鵬：譯自四月二十八日大陸新報）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我們怎樣去認識人</h3>
<p>— 何許</p>
<p>俗語：「不怕不識字，只怕不識人。」這句話着實有幾分道理的。</p>
<p>我們平當看或聽了「文章家」的一篇救國論文，演說家的一席激昂慷慨的演說，簡直崇拜得「五體投地」，高呼萬歲的也有。看了一本動情的小說，每會使少女暗自對這作者發生單戀的情形，也是常有的事。但一見了他們或接觸了幾時，就也以爲是平平常常的人，所謂「英雄日見也常人」。這樣就認爲楚「人心不可測」了。</p>
<p>難道眞的「人心不可測」了嗎？不，所以說這句話的人，就是對「人」的認識上出了毛病或者有些地方還不够。</p>
<p>我們認爲人是宇宙的一份子，生物的一員，雖說人爲「萬物之靈」，但他始終是帶着動物的習氣和性質的。所以當你在分析一個人的生活時，決不要忘了他是個「人一，（「聖賢」當然也如此）那就好辦了。</p>
<p>再者，人是生長在社會中的，他的思想，習慣，行爲，嗜好等等，都必須受他所處的社會的制度和意識所規定，限制。所以我們要認識一個人，不能從他的身上，從頭直到脚，看長看短的評定他的好處和錯處，這樣把他當作孤立的東西去權衡他的輕重，是極不確切的。我們必須把他赤裸裸的按放着，看他在今日的社會中如何？</p>
<p>有些人平常所認爲舉世的豪傑，一且聽見了他的太太，秘書或者茶房說他是個吃的大王，懶的混君，就不免吐出了舌頭，大爲驚奇。而平日對他不快意的人，就作爲攻擊他的利器，加油加醬地宣佈他十大罪狀，這一切在今日「人」的權衡中，常作爲天平的砝碼。道是公正的嗎？不，這樣平日抽象地指他爲「超人」，現今把他的私生活加以强調，擴大，而忽略了他也是具有「人」性的，更沒把他對社會的貢獻和功勳作爲砝碼，是極錯誤的。不是嗎，他也是個而肉之軀，「人」一切物質的慾求，難道他竟不能有嗎？</p>
<p>譬如，節儉和耐苦，是我們私生活中峯爲「余科玉律」的。時常同情，佩服某人的布衣素食，剃光頭，日必步行二十里，（不坐黃包車）讀書六小時，不看荀慧生。但忽略了這些對社會的意義，他的節衣縮食等等的「懿行」，原是爲了好治私產，却是個十足迫地的守財奴。世人常拿節儉，耐苦來沽名釣譽的多得很。他們常拿這些小節來博得大家同情，要別人忘了他在社會上所作的罪惡。本來很好的這些「懿行」，反而作了惡人的工具，欺騙的幌子。我們時常可看見，自己刮了五六千萬的鈔票，殺了不知好多老百姓，（如孫傳芳之流）於是身上換了老布大衫，手拿念佛珠，滿口阿彌陀佛，巡難道可作爲權衡的砝碼麼？</p>
<p>也有些政治上文學上有極大功績的，他處處都爲公衆，雖在私生活上並不多大嚴肅，多交幾個女朋友，多跑幾决電影院，這難道能一筆抹殺他說他是個十惡不赦的淫棍，壞蛋？</p>
<p>雖然，我們並不否認私生活會影響公生活的，尤其在個人的發展上，要看重私生活。奢侈容易引起貪汚，懶散容易變爲消沉，……。但我們始終把公生活的估價，要超過私生活，——認爲公生活是權衡人的價値的第一顆砝碼。</p>
<h3>關於「忘我」</h3>
<p>— 靑君</p>
<p>「欲除煩惱須無我」，這是一個明友書齋裏看到的兪曲園先生的一副對聯中的上聯。最近，又偶然在本刋上讀到一篇小小的「花邊文學」——「忘我」，覺得有動於中，頗想說一說。</p>
<p>「欲除煩惱須無我」與「忘我」是異曲同工的東西，當然，只有字面上的不同。雖然，它有着大無畏的精神，把小我給遺忘掉，而去爲大我效勞，但它也多少帶有點消極，退守的成分和頹廢的意味在內的；有時，照這樣地發展下去，是很可能地有「看破紅塵」而「入了空門」的氣概。</p>
<p>當然，世界上多少偉大人物的成就，得力於「忘我」的一定不在少數，但是，這裏就忽略了另一面——偉大人物的爲公而忘私固然是一個好榜樣，但這個模範的造成者，到底還是那個「小我」在起着最基本的作用，要是，沒有了這個「我」字，世界上的「自私自利」或許會大大地减少，可是，脚踏實地幹的「我」，却是不能忘掉的一切事物創造的原動力。</p>
<p>因此，「無我」與「忘我」雖然是人類需要的一種精神，但「欲除煩惱」而「無我」，究竟是太過份的意戰。然而，這「無我」中的大公無私的精神的內容，卻是可以保留下來的優越的地方，可是，必不可少的還是從「我」字着手做起的基本精神。</p>
<p>同時，這裏再說明一點，這「有我」的積極性與「無我」中的偉大精神，却是兩者必需兼備的創造事業的基本要素。而兩者間，也沒有衝突的地方，雖然，看上去是矛盾的東西，但還必須統一了才會有成功的指望的。</p>
<p>「忘我」中的消極成分，我們要把它淸除出去，而讓從我做起的積極性來塡充它的缺陷。</p>
<h3>可貴的經騐</h3>
<p>— 嘉雪</p>
<p>一個人在出學校的大門以前，往往自以爲巳經知這得很多，可以去應付任何困難的事情：或者自以爲憑着勇氣和熱忱，可以解決難題而不必費多大精力。等到和實際的社會接觸以後，整個情形和從前所想像所描繪的大不相同，於是收拾起自己的悔恨，用另一種新的方法去應付社會，用另一種新的學識去解决難題。這樣經過了許多年，纔熟悉了社會的實况，感覺到經騐的可貴，並且從前在書本上所學得的知識，也重新有用起來，不像當初那樣完全失掉自信，而恍悟到知識和經騐的終能得到連繫。</p>
<p>一個人從小就生活在社會的實陰情况中，他對於書本上的知識當然接受得很少，他所學習的却是切實有用的技能。這樣經過了許多年，他巳經很熟練於他自己的行業　他的經騐潛藏在適當的應付事物和沉着的處理問題之中，但是他却無庸反省，也不易思慮到經騐是怎樣得來的，這由於他得米是很目然的，因爲他的經騐便是知識。</p>
<p>這兩種人，他們都得釗經騐的益處，但是前者是自覺的，後者是不自覺的，而經騐的可貴，却是不可否認的事實。講到獲得經騐以後怎樣發展，那末後者比較易於守成，趨於頑固，而進一步的精進創造，常屬於前者了。</p>
<h3>漁翁談魚綱</h3>
<p>— 文中</p>
<p>在一條小溪旁我遇到了熟悉的漁翁　一位慈祥的老者，兩目閃閃有光，鼻尖兒紅紅地，下巴上飄着幾絲銀鬚，褪色的藍布衣褲，包裹着結實的身子。</p>
<p>我和他並肩坐在一塊靑石上，我見他粗壯的手熟練地拋下了魚網，水面上起了一圈圈的波波紋。</p>
<p>「你的的網，」我說：「似乎很密，繩索很堅固的吧？」我覺得自己問的太幼稚，太無聊。</p>
<p>「是呀！」漁翁懇切地回答着，臉上浮起一絲笑意，「魚網必須要如此才行！網密了小魚才不會漏去。」他停了一下，接着說：「但單密而不堅，網到了大魚，因爲魚大力强，一陣掙扎之後，也許會破網而出，那些小魚，不用說，也跟在後面溜之大吉……」</p>
<p>「不錯，對極……」</p>
<p>「年靑的朋友啊！」漁翁用溫和面沈毅的語調對我說，態度顯得非常誠懇，「你不要勿視我所說的關於魚網的話，以爲太平凡無奇，要知道我們處理仟何大小的事件，必須精密而堅決，你還年靑……」</p>
<p>我注神傾聽着，會意地點着頭。</p>

<p>爲了要賺錢，於是劇本的內容儘在狹小的戀情圈子裏轉，以迎合一輩觀衆的趣味，「寓敎育於娛樂」的口號儘喊得震天價響，而事實呢？中聯一年來的影片數量不算少吧！而所謂敎育片，據我所知，僅僅三部：「博愛」，「母親」，和最近的「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙」。</p>
<p>中聯當局到底是聰明的，明知道敎育片是不賣錢的，於是在這一張敎育片「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙」中也要硬插一些「噱頭」進去，加了幾段白光唱大鼓的塲面。</p>
<p>値得商榷之處是有的，醫如：梅熹感於白光的魅力，相與繾綣，數天不上公司辦公，但總不致於甚而會把自己的朝夕相處的兒子（年紀不過十歲充右）忘得一乾二爭，置於兒子的生活不顧。再說梅熹這樣一個正人君子，會變得這樣快，也太不顧情理了。諸如梅熹到白光家去碰見經理徐莘園，太巧，當時白光頓變對梅熹以往愛慕的態度，頗出人意外。</p>
<p>導演對於小地方也計不很注意，響如：梅熹扮演的達川不過三四十歲的光景，而他的妻子的遺像，看起來郤有五六十歲的光景了。又如，繼川—達川的兒子—被大雨淋了一身，面部當然都是雨水了，但梅熹見到了他問道：「你在哭嗎？」他怎能分辨得出面上除了雨水外還有淚水呢？</p>
<p>爲了要强調悲哀的氣氛，使繼川放學回來，遇到了大雷雨，不急速歸家，而在大雨滂沱下立着痴想，再讓達川等得不耐煩了，出門撑了一把傘冒雨去找兒子，兩人碰見了，繼川還要向父親說什麼不願讀書要找工做的話，連雨淋都不顧，似乎太勉强了一點。</p>
<p>但不管導演是失敗或成功，這一張片子，可說是「敎育片」，可以一看，尤其是爲子女者，看了之後總很感動吧！</p>
<h3>想一想</h3>
<p>— 一葦</p>
<p>如果在做一樁事以前，或在做一樁事的當兒，以及做過了一樁事之後，都能够仔細想一想，那末，就可使經騐豐富，觀察力週到，思想合理敏捷有系統；逢到以後第二决發生這種事情的時候，就可增加許多的順利和便宜。</p>
<p>許多人在做一件事之前，做這事的時候，和做過了這事以後，從不肯費一些腦筋去想一想；因而所做的很多可以作爲歎息的資料。</p>
<p>有些人很肯動腦筋，每做一樁事，先要想一想我是否應當做，我是否有這能力去做，做了有什麼效果，對於名譽上人格上身體上各方面有什麼影響；如果考慮下來，的確是有益或應當做的就下一個決心去實行，決不猶豫。如果是利害參半，可以做，可以不做的，那末還是不做；因爲同樣做這事的時間，很可以移到別種更有益的工作上面去。如果是沒有益處的，當然尅制自己，決計不做，那怕巨大的威脅也不苟且。</p>
<p>當研究結果是覺得有做的必要的話去實行的時候，又要加一番考慮，把許多方法擺在一起，比較　，思量着，要採取那一種步驟，才得事半功倍而沒有失敗的危險。</p>
<p>人類的歷史，充滿了那些不曾養成想一想的習慣的人的粗莽和不小心所造成的悲劇。假使人人都有想一想的習慣，我敢相信：不但人命之喪失，事業之失敗，可以大大的减少：而且人們的品格和道德，也可以大大的提高了。</p>
<p>所以要努力義成「想一想」的習慣，使每一件事都經過考慮，這是我們當前的急務。</p>

<h3>"High Profile" and "Low Profile" Are Both Undesirable</h3>
<p>"Wholeheartedly supporting" the government's decision to improve people's livelihood policies, and "sincerely urging" the government to implement policies to improve people's livelihood – this is the natural duty of public opinion, a responsibility that cannot be abandoned. Therefore, we will not shy away from loudly advocating for and repeatedly discussing issues related to people's livelihood. Our hearts are open, our attitude is sincere, and driven by a sense of responsibility, we will speak the words the masses want to say, without fear of taboo, and without hesitating to offend, we will express our views directly. Thus, it is unavoidable to offend the "dignity" of a few, who say we are "abusively singing a high profile." Originally, "facts speak louder than words," and we disdain making unnecessary arguments. However, we are willing to take this opportunity to elaborate slightly, in order to correct the misunderstandings and distortions of a few.</p>
<p>What is a "high profile"? Anything that is actually not capable of being done, or impossible to do, but is insisted upon being done, resulting in it not being done, is a "high profile." To simply "exaggerate," to "brag," to disregard reality, and to break promises, is also a "high profile."</p>
<p>What is a "low profile"? Anything that is capable of being done, or possible to do, but is abandoned, with excuses made, is a "low profile." Lacking self-confidence, lacking self-respect, and unable to muster spirit, is also a "low profile."</p>
<p>Any political or economic proposition that is absolutely beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and that can surely be achieved as long as there is determination and perseverance, is definitely not a "high profile." For example, the National Government's recent advocacy of "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding" and "strictly prohibiting gambling"; for example, this newspaper's advocacy of "separation of officials and merchants" and "establishment of a people's participation system," etc., are all absolutely beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and can surely be achieved as long as there is determination and perseverance. Such propositions are definitely not a "high profile."</p>
<p>To give a more recent example, such as Chairman Lin Sen, who is old and of high virtue, whose birthday on May 4th was celebrated by various parties, but the Chairman, in order to correct customs, declined birthday celebrations, while a senior employee of a certain bank in Shanghai, who is still young, reportedly sent a special plane to Beijing to bring famous actors to Shanghai for a private performance to celebrate his birthday. Comparing these two events, some people may say that the former is a "high profile." However, we see that Chairman Lin Sen, in his own writing on the 24th, declined everything; and on the 27th, he further used a National Government order to strictly prohibit offering money in the name of birthday celebrations, and cited the shameful example of the bear before the Xi'an Incident as a warning. Facts like this, where words are followed by actions with determination, we absolutely cannot consider a "high profile." In this extraordinary period, the leader of a country, leading by example, can all the more have the effect of refreshing the people's views. If the government can extend this meaning and expand upon it, then the talk of "high profile" will surely disappear from now on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for a certain proposition, even though completing the ideal and achieving the goal is beyond the current strength and environment, such a proposition does not count as a "high profile." For example, the National Government's advocacy of the Sino-Japanese peace movement, whose ideal and goal is undoubtedly "comprehensive peace," even though it is beyond the current strength to achieve, we absolutely cannot misunderstand it as a "high profile." For the same reason, this newspaper's advocacy of "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding," "strictly prohibiting gambling," "separation of officials and merchants," and "establishment of a people's participation system," its ideal and goal are the same as the government's advocacy. There is no distinction between "high profile" and "low profile" in this, and it cannot be misunderstood as a "high profile."</p>
<p>Here, we can give a definition: "Any proposition that can possibly complete the ideal and achieve the goal, even though it is beyond the strength to achieve for the time being, does not count as a high profile." However, this definition still has a prerequisite, which is "to do it with determination and perseverance," and not to stand idly by waiting for the realization of the ideal and the achievement of the goal. Therefore, even if there are very good ideal propositions in politics and economics, such as "comprehensive peace movement" and "thorough investigation of hoarding," etc., if they are not done with determination and perseverance, then what was originally not a "high profile" can easily become a "high profile." Another example is that the government has already issued an order prohibiting gambling, but there are still gambling dens in Shanghai. The government has not achieved its own proposition, which is an example of something that was originally not a "high profile" but will become a "high profile."</p>
<p>We must cautiously prevent our propositions, which were originally not a "high profile," from becoming a true "high profile" because we do not use determination and perseverance to do them. At the same time, we must pay special attention to the fact that anything that should be done is not done; that is, anything that is capable of being done, but is abandoned, and excuses are made not to do it, this will even turn from a "low profile" into "no profile," which is the most dangerous phenomenon.</p>
<p>When we open the history of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, a country, a ruling government, in times of political abnormality, those in power often like to sing a "low profile," or even "no profile." And the voices of the people are often misunderstood as a "high profile." But, what era are we in now? We must open our eyes. Our country today is at a critical moment of striving for survival. We must be united from top to bottom, be down-to-earth, and with determination and perseverance, complete our ideals and achieve our goals. Absolutely no "high profile" or "low profile" is allowed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the government and the people urgently need to become one. The people absolutely cannot criticize the government's propositions and performances as a "high profile" or "low profile"; only by wholeheartedly supporting the government, supporting the government, urging the government, implementing propositions, implementing policies, and completing political ideals. If the government wants the people to be silent, or wants to hear flattering words, then what basis will the government have to truly make a fresh start with the people? "Honest advice jars on the ear," originally referred to what "ordinary" people cannot accept. In this extraordinary period, we expect "extraordinary" leaders to accept "honest advice" that "ordinary people" cannot accept. As for others who are in a leading position but do not have the "extraordinary" spirit to accept honest advice, we have no expectations of them.</p>
<p>Finally, anything that benefits the country and the people, the government must do it without hesitation; conversely, anything that is harmful, must be thoroughly eliminated. This is the only way for the government and the people to become one.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Officially Announces Tani Masayuki Appointed Ambassador to China The Ambassador Has a Deep Understanding and Sympathy for China Relations Between the Two Countries Will Surely Become Closer After Arrival</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, at 3 p.m. today, in the Phoenix Pavilion of the Imperial Palace, with Prime Minister Tojo attending, held the ceremony of personally appointing the new Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki. After bestowing the imperial rescript of personal appointment to the new ambassador, Prime Minister Tojo conveyed the official seal and official stamp. At the same time, it was officially announced that Tani Masayuki, with the rank of Jusanmi, would be appointed as the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After former Ambassador to China Shigemitsu was honorably appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government carefully weighed the candidates for the post of Ambassador to China. In order to adapt to the world war situation, and based on a grand ideal, in order to complete a new policy towards China, the Japanese government considered former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki to be the most suitable. After obtaining Mr. Tani Masayuki's agreement, the Japanese government followed the procedures stipulated in diplomacy and sought the consent of the National Government of the Republic of China. The official letter of consent from the National Government was sent to the Japanese government on the 26th of this month, and the ceremony of personally appointing the Ambassador to China was formally held in the Imperial Palace at 15:00 today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: The new Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, after completing the personal appointment ceremony today, met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Ministry and spoke at length about his aspirations for strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation. The gist of his speech was that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese side's awareness of the common enemy of East Asia has also been increasing day by day. As a result, the National Government resolutely joined the war on January 9, formed a common front with our country, and worked hard to defeat Britain and the United States, liberate East Asia, and build a co-prosperity sphere. The Imperial Government, in order to adapt to this new situation, and with the aim of assisting the National Government to strengthen its political power, resolutely implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. China's long-cherished wish for sovereignty and integrity has been fulfilled. The co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan has also embarked on its natural track. In the future, our country will thoroughly implement this new policy, which is already firm and needless to say. This is of great significance in building a new order in Greater East Asia. Therefore, its results, which will affect the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and even the world, are difficult to estimate. I have been entrusted with this great mission, and I will be dedicated like a front-line soldier, deeply understand the government's policy, stand up to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation, and be aware of the importance of the current Sino-Japanese relations. I plan to depart as soon as possible and arrive in Nanjing in mid-May to take office.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki was appointed Ambassador to China less than a month after resigning from the post of Foreign Minister in the previous cabinet reshuffle. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage, the appointment of former Foreign Minister Tani as Ambassador to China will undoubtedly further strengthen Sino-Japanese relations. At the same time, it can also be seen that Japan is determined to cooperate and cooperate with China. The traditional friendly relations between China and Japan have become increasingly complicated since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Later, the National Government returned to Nanjing, and Sino-Japanese relations became clearer again. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year, and the Japanese government also implemented a new policy to promote Sino-Japanese relations, assisting China in restoring its national rights. Thus, Sino-Japanese relations entered a new stage. In the future, Japan's implementation of policies to promote Sino-Japanese relations will become even more important. When Ambassador Tani served as Foreign Minister and President of the Information Bureau in the past, he and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia jointly planned and promoted the essentials of Sino-Japanese relations in the central government. It is most appropriate to appoint him as Ambassador to China. It can also be seen that the Japanese government is determined to promote new Sino-Japanese relations through this change of personnel, with Shigemitsu and Tani switching posts. In this way, China's cooperation can be further strengthened to crush foreign forces and assist China in construction, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After China joined the war, Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage. Japan is making more active efforts to implement its policy towards China. During his tenure, former Ambassador Shigemitsu completed goodwill and friendly diplomatic measures such as the first return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Our country, both the government and the public, are grateful for this. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Japanese Foreign Minister, the Japanese government has recently appointed former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki to succeed Shigemitsu as Ambassador to China. The welcome and expectations of our government for the new Ambassador Tani have been seen in the speeches of Minister of Propaganda Lin and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou. The government and the public are eager for Ambassador Tani, who is shouldering responsibility, to take office as soon as possible. However, we should pay special attention to the fact that Ambassador Tani is taking on this important position at a time when Sino-Japanese relations are becoming increasingly close. He is also the direct supervisor of Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. Based on his experience, it can be seen that he is a person who has the most knowledge of China, and who must have understanding and enthusiasm for the relationship between the two countries, and the spirit of the two peoples sharing life and death. Although former Ambassador Shigemitsu completed great deeds such as the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions during his tenure, it is precisely because of this that Sino-Japanese relations have advanced to a higher level, and future policies are even more worthy of expectation. We can further predict that after the arrival of the new Ambassador Tani, Sino-Japanese relations will become closer, and the cooperation between the two countries will be further expanded, and the various policies that should be implemented after the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights will be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Statement of Welcome from the National Government Authorities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After the Japanese government announced the appointment of Tani Masayuki as the successor to the Ambassador to China, Minister of Propaganda Lin Bosheng specially responded to reporters' questions and issued a welcome statement as follows: "After Ambassador Shigemitsu was honorably transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, the outside world paid close attention to the candidates for the successor. Since our country joined the war, Sino-Japanese relations have become more harmonious in order to adapt to the needs of wartime; and to lay the foundation for the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the successor must be a capable person who can strengthen diplomatic relations, and who is in line with the fundamental policies of Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. This is no need to speculate. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, and Foreign Minister Tani has been transferred to the post of Ambassador, it can be clearly seen that the diplomatic relations between the two countries will continue the development of the past and become more strengthened. Not only are the colleagues of the National Government extremely welcome, but also the general political commentators are happy to have found the right person. Last autumn, I went to friendly countries to study the training of youth organizations. At that time, Ambassador Tani had just taken office as Foreign Minister. He treated me kindly and gave me various kinds of assistance. I was able to receive instruction and accomplish my mission. I am grateful and will never forget it. I remember that I once mentioned that although there is a body of water, the Pacific Ocean, between China and Japan, standing on the position of the entire East Asia, the natural relationship between the two countries cannot be blocked by the ocean. In order to build an iron bridge across the Pacific Ocean between the two countries, I am deeply willing to spend the rest of my life with the Chinese youth to follow the advanced countries and engage in the construction of this iron bridge. Ambassador Shigemitsu and Foreign Minister Tani will do their best to work hard for this great project. Now that Ambassador Shigemitsu has been transferred to the post of Foreign Minister, and Ambassador Tani has been transferred to the post of Ambassador, it can be seen that the construction of this iron bridge is being stepped up, and the date of success is not far away."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: The Japanese government has now announced the appointment of former Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki as the successor to the Ambassador to China. Zhou Longxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, specially issued a statement on this matter as follows: "This time, the friendly country of Japan appointed former Foreign Minister Tani as the Ambassador to China. I am very pleased to hear about it, and I express my sincere welcome. Ambassador Tani is senior and highly respected, serving in the Japanese diplomatic community for nearly thirty years. He has extensive experience and is famous at home and abroad. He has served in important positions in embassies in various European and American countries. He has been the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. He once resided in Shanghai as a Minister. He has always had understanding and enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Last year, I accompanied the delegation to visit Japan. I personally heard Ambassador Tani's high-level discussions and great aspirations regarding the overall situation in Tokyo, and I was deeply moved. I remember that in the past, Ambassador Tani, during his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, shouldered the heavy responsibility of planning Japan's wartime diplomacy. At that time, our country declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War. During this period, he made many contributions to Sino-Japanese relations, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. He sincerely assisted in everything. This time, he was ordered to be the Ambassador to China, which proves that Japan's diplomatic policy towards China has not changed in the slightest, and will be further implemented based on Ambassador Tani's efforts, so that Sino-Japanese relations will become more harmonious, and the policies of the National Government will be more concretely realized. The Greater East Asia War is now winning victory after victory, and has completely eliminated the colonialism of Britain and the United States in East Asia for a hundred years. The liberation of the East Asian nations and the construction of a new order in East Asia have laid a solid foundation. In the future, ensuring this victory and consolidating the foundation of this construction will depend on the sincere unity of the East Asian nations. I remember that when I accompanied the delegation to visit Japan last year, Ambassador Tani said in his welcome speech that the cooperation between China and Japan has reached a perfect realm, which is truly gratifying. However, the cooperation between the two countries is not only a matter of temporary interests, but also a matter of basic Sino-Japanese relations. The provisions of the treaty are based on the common ideal of building a new order, and have the characteristics of spiritual unity. We firmly believe that Ambassador Tani's mission to China will enable the two great nations of China and Japan to make further progress in sincere unity, so as to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, so that the final victory can be achieved and the construction of the new order can be completed as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>Takase Shinichi Succeeds as Counselor of the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: After Toyokazu Nakamura, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing, was transferred to the post of Minister to Finland this time, the vacancy was filled today by Shinichi Takase, the Consul-General, who was appointed by the Greater East Asia Ministry.</p>
<h3>The Jingnan Japanese Army Expands its War Gains</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Since the elite units of the Japanese army occupied Linqi, the base of the Chongqing army's "24th Army Group," they continued to mop up the remnants of the Chongqing "New 5th Army" and "40th Army," about 20,000 men, entrenched in the western mountainous area, and most of them have now been wiped out. On the 27th, the Japanese army turned its offensive and began to encircle the main force of the Chongqing "27th Army," a direct descendant of Chiang Kai-shek, under Liu Jin, near the Huogzhen Hengshui Village south of Lingchuan. The Japanese army units maintained close contact and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, gradually shrinking the encirclement. In addition, the "106th Division Commander" Li Zhenqing, who was entrenched in Dongyaoji, southeast of Linqi, was captured. More than 2,000 Japanese troops also began to attack fiercely on the 27th. The war is now in its final stage. The mopping-up operation of the Japanese army against the Chongqing "24th Army Group" has gradually come to an end. Therefore, the only surviving force of the Chongqing army in North China has been almost completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: According to the front line of the Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi, the main force of the Chongqing 24th Army Group was suddenly plunged into chaos due to the Japanese army's intrusion into Linqi. Its remnants were forced to flee to the western area of the Linqi Basin, a steep mountainous area of the Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army detected that the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Pang Bingxun, the Commander of the 27th Army, Liu Jin, and the Commander of the 40th Army, Ma Buwu, had escaped with a small number of guards and fled into the Taihang Mountains. They began searching in the mountains on the 25th, overcoming difficult mountain roads and bravely attacking. As of the 27th, the war gains of the Japanese army units were as follows: (1) From the 25th, the Japanese army units that attacked Pang Bingxun and Li Yuntong's Department of the 29th Division of the 40th Army, wiped out more than 600 remnants of the Chongqing army 30 kilometers southwest of Tianjiajing on the 27th. As a result, 200 people were captured, and 40 light machine guns and 50 rifles were intercepted. They are still pursuing them. (2) On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese army units severely attacked the Chongqing New Fifth Army, which was retreating to the west of the Linqi Basin, near Nanling, 23 kilometers west of Linhong, and completely defeated it. In this battle, the Chongqing army left 31 bodies, and 110 people were captured. The Japanese army intercepted 1 heavy machine gun, 30 light machine guns, 50 rifles, 15,000 rounds of ammunition, and 20 military horses. In addition, other Japanese army units attacked the Chongqing 40th Army near Bingxicun, 35 kilometers west of Linqi, captured 145 Chongqing troops, and intercepted 330 rifles and 17,000 rounds of ammunition. (3) After destroying the military facilities of the Chongqing army in Zejiecun Hexizhen, the Japanese army intercepted 2 mountain guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 101 rifles, and 2124 rounds of machine gun shells on the 27th. They have now broken through the provincial border to Xiaguan Linhong, 20 kilometers southwest, and turned to attack the remnants of the Chongqing army in Jin Province.</p>
<p>Beijing, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: Okamura, the Supreme Commander of the Dispatch Army to China, personally inspected the battle situation in which the Chongqing 24th Army Group was wiped out this time. He flew to a certain place by plane on the 26th to listen to the battle report from a certain unit commander of the Japanese army.

<p>Taiyuan, 28th, Central News Agency telegram: According to the front line of the Shanxi-Hebei provincial border, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Chongqing New Fifth Army, led all his troops to surrender. The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Sun in a certain place on the night of the 27th. The reporter's questions and answers with Mr. Sun are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your thoughts on this war? (Answer) At present, the combat strength of the Chongqing army is several times weaker than when the incident occurred. This is because the people's thoughts and will to resist Japan have disappeared. (Question) What is the internal trend of Chongqing after the National Government joined the war? (Answer) The opposition between the opinions of resistance and peace within Chongqing is very obvious, especially the relationship between Chongqing and the Chongqing Party is even worse. This can be fully evident in the First War Zone. There are often internal conflicts within the 20th West Army Group. (Question) What is the friction between the Chongqing and Communist armies? (Answer) The Chongqing army is actively on guard against the Communist army. Moreover, due to the poor harvest last year, there is a great shortage of food. Therefore, it sent guerrillas to sneak into the base of the 24th Army Group to seize food, so conflicts often break out between the two sides.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Occurs in Yu Xuezhong's Department</h3>
<p>Beijing, 27th, Central News Agency telegram: Since General Wu Huawen joined the peace camp in January of this year, there have been internal strife incidents in the department of Yu Xuezhong, the Commander of Chongqing. Recently, it was reported that Zhang Buyun, the commander of the Second Security Division directly under Yu Xuezhong, led his troops, a battalion of 4,000 men, to attack the position of Sun Huancai, the commander of the 111th Division, at Xujiagou on April 15. As a result, they failed, and one regimental commander and 600 soldiers were captured, and many were killed in battle. It is said that Yu Xuezhong has ordered Sun Huancai to pursue Zhang Buyun's department. Han Deqin, the Deputy Commander of the War Zone, was released after agreeing to wipe out the New Fourth Army. He was deeply afraid that his department would waver. On March 6, two brigades of his department were surrounded and wiped out by the New Fourth Army in the Siyang area (Jiangsu Province), suffering a great loss. On April 1, a small team under his direct command, the 89th Army, fled with light machine guns, rifles, etc. On the same day, the soldiers of the Kuku service stole many rifles, and the supervising officers fled with a large number of military salaries and confidential documents, etc.</p>

<h3>Allied Powers' Pacific Strategy - Each Seeks Its Own Interest, Opinions Diverge - Britain's European Focus Neglects Australia's Plea for Help</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly been defeated in the Southwest Pacific, the Australian government has repeatedly requested reinforcements. At the same time, the Chongqing side also, due to the retreat of British troops in Arakan, mobilized the Ta Kung Pao and other official newspapers to repeatedly appeal, strongly advocating the necessity of a counter-offensive in East Asia. Therefore, the "Europe first" strategy of the Casablanca type has become the focus of debate in the anti-Axis camp. Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner in London, recently addressed the issue when attending a luncheon hosted by the Australian Journalists' Association on New Zealand Army Memorial Day, stating Australia's position. The London Times responded in an editorial the following day, strongly advocating the "Europe first" strategy. The antagonism within the anti-Axis camp is thus evident. Bruce's speech, in essence, stated that Australia's situation after the fall of Singapore was similar to that of Britain after the fall of France. In early 1942, the urgent crisis facing Australia and New Zealand's equal position in the Pacific anti-Axis alliance was not fully understood by Britain. More than a year after Japan's entry into the war, Australia has been hampered by insufficient manpower, and the situation in the East Asian war has been extremely unfavorable. However, the Australian government has not withdrawn the Australian troops remaining on the Middle East front. In 1940, the Australian government also sent a division to the Malay Peninsula. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Australia's air force strength was extremely weak, with not a single modern military aircraft. In the previous Great War, Australia's air force personnel numbered only 600, but now it has reached 100,000. 25% of Australia's available merchant tonnage has been used to transport steel to the United States to meet the absolute needs of Britain. Out of 2.5 million Australian men aged 24 to 65, 500,000 have been enlisted for military service. If calculated at the same ratio, it would be equivalent to Britain conscripting 4.5 million people and the United States conscripting 4 million people. Australia's military production in 1939 was insignificant, and major weapons such as tanks, armored vehicles, and military aircraft for combat were not produced at all. Regarding the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, the British government had made reassuring guarantees, but the result was the opposite. The Australian government, considering that the British navy should fully reinforce the area, also pointed out the need to strengthen the air force, but this suggestion was not accepted by the British government. Judging from what happened afterward, even if our sacrifices had been great, we could not have prevented the Japanese army from occupying the territory they now control. In this area occupied by the Japanese army, the main products are rubber, oil, and tin, and more importantly, quinine. Today, these resources will be fully utilized by the Japanese army, and it is a confirmed fact that the anti-Axis forces cannot get their hands on them, and so on. Bruce's speech clearly criticized Britain's selfishness, and the British Times also expressed its selfish views in an editorial, pointing out the reasons why it could not send reinforcements to the Pacific. In particular, it abandoned its usual verbal aid to Chongqing and openly declared its inability to help, saying that the expeditionary force on the North African front requires a well-protected merchant fleet of 20,000 tons, and 100,000 tons of ships are needed to maintain the supply of the landing forces. Therefore, even if the anti-Axis forces could allow the dispatch of the same force to the Pacific, as far as the current situation is concerned, it is obvious that it is impossible to transport this army by sea. Britain has mobilized 9 million troops, including men and women's auxiliary forces, and the United States has reached 10 million or 11 million. If the European war comes to an end, the troops of Britain and the United States will reach at least 20 million people. Although the anti-Axis forces have such a huge force, it is actually impossible to send 5 million people to the Pacific. Moreover, the most important thing for fighting the Japanese army is air and sea battles, so it seems that there is no need to send such a large army to the Pacific, but to strengthen the air force. Furthermore, Chongqing has been at war with the Japanese army since March 1937, so it believed that it would receive British and American aid when the Anglo-Saxon countries joined the war. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, it has been a year and a half, and it is still suffering the tragedy of misgovernment and fantasy. However, witnessing the difficult situation of Britain and the United States, it can be fully understood that this difficulty is not unreasonable, but the anti-Axis forces have also deeply realized from their difficult experiences that it is difficult to obtain other better strategies except to concentrate all their efforts on the most important battlefields. Britain's manpower is indeed insufficient to complete a large-scale operation 8,000 miles away from its own country. Moreover, Germany is still watching covetously 20 miles away from Dover. Therefore, it is inevitable that the German army should be defeated before attacking Japan around the globe.</p>
<h3>National Government Presents Medal to Japanese Emperor - Japanese Emperor Sends Telegram of Thanks to Chairman Wang</h3>

It is now known that His Majesty the Japanese Emperor immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government to express his thanks and wish China prosperity and the close cooperation between the two countries to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>How to Strengthen Sino-Manchu Solidarity - Zhou Fohai's Radio Address in Xinjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Zhou Fohai, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, delivered a radio speech in Xinjing on April 12, entitled "How to Strengthen Sino-Manchu Solidarity"? The original text is recorded as follows: "Citizens of Manchukuo: I am very happy and excited to have the opportunity to express some personal observations and opinions to you. Before coming to your country, I had already heard that Manchukuo's construction in recent years has made rapid progress. Whether in politics, economy, military affairs, or culture, there has been a leap forward and good results. When I stepped into your country's territory, I saw the stability of society, the establishment of public security, the progress of production, and the expansion of education, which made me have unlimited admiration for the vision and perseverance of the ruling officials and the hard work and cooperation of the citizens. At the same time, I am very happy that Manchukuo is already a strong partner in the East Asian Axis. Manchukuo's prosperity is the prosperity of the East Asian Axis, and the strength of the East Asian Axis can determine the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which can symbolize the bright future of Greater East Asia. The increasing strength of China and Manchukuo on the Asian continent is enough to help our friendly country Japan quickly complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War and quickly carry out the construction of East Asian co-prosperity. This time I came to visit your country, first to investigate the actual situation of your country's economic construction in the past ten years, and second to enhance the friendship between China and Manchukuo and strengthen the unity between China and Manchukuo. China and Manchukuo have inseparable close relations in geography, history, economy, culture, and even the daily life of the two countries' citizens. Because the national conditions of China and Manchukuo are so similar, the methods and techniques used by your country in economic construction can naturally be used as a reference and model for China. I have decided to visit your country this time to try my best to investigate your country's existing construction achievements and have frank discussions with all walks of life in your country to serve as a mirror for China's economic construction. Because China must vigorously carry out economic construction, whether it is to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War or to carry out post-war construction. If China's national strength is not strong and the people's strength is not strong, it is a lack of a strong link in the East Asian Axis, which has an adverse impact on the establishment of the East Asian Axis and the progress of East Asian construction. We believe that China's needs are also East Asia's needs, so we are carrying out economic construction with the strength of the whole country. On this point, we fervently hope that your country and our friendly country Japan can give us as much and more assistance as possible.</p>
<p>The second thing to say is how to enhance the friendship between China and Manchukuo and strengthen the unity between China and Manchukuo. Since the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued, China and Manchukuo have restored their inherent friendship and established the friendly relations between China and Manchukuo. Since our friendly country Japan launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8 of the year before last and raised the banner of building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the responsibilities of China and Manchukuo, which are also members of the East Asian Axis, have been increased and heavier due to the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War. On January 9 this year, the Republic of China resolutely joined the war and shared life and death with our friendly country Japan. China's responsibilities and tasks in East Asia are heavier and more numerous than before. Manchukuo is a link in the East Asian Axis, and its responsibilities and tasks in East Asia are no different from those of China and Japan. Especially this Greater East Asia War is not only to drive out the evil forces of Britain and the United States in Asia by war, but also to build East Asia into a paradise shared by East Asians after this war. Therefore, I often say that the Greater East Asia War is not just a war. We must fight and build at the same time. Without war, we cannot eliminate the obstacles to construction. Without construction, it is not enough to carry out a long-term Greater East Asia War, and it is not enough to ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We need active construction and continuous construction to make East Asia a paradise of co-prosperity for East Asians and a new world of co-existence. As for winning the war and carrying out long-term construction, both require strength. Where does strength come from? It comes from the solid unity of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. One of my tasks in visiting your country is how to enhance the existing friendship and strengthen the existing unity. Strengthening the unity between China and Manchukuo means increasing our common strength, and then we can effectively assist our friendly country Japan in winning the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Strengthening unity can be said to be our common requirement. What methods can be used to achieve the goal of strengthening unity? I think the first is spiritual unity. The foundation of spiritual unity can also be said to be the principle, which is to love one's own country, love one's neighbors, and love East Asia together. The citizens of China and Manchukuo must have the determination to love themselves and love others in order to achieve true spiritual unity. This unity is based on morality and aims at everyone's freedom and equality, just as the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo said: "It is hoped that the three countries will respect each other's inherent characteristics and closely cooperate as good neighbors under the common ideal of building a new order based on morality in East Asia, so as to form the axis of permanent peace in East Asia and hope to contribute to the peace of the whole world with this as the core." This kind of spiritual unity based on morality is an indispensable principle and method for realizing East Asian co-prosperity and building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is the opposite of the combination of interests based on utilitarianism by Britain and the United States. For example, in the past, Britain and the United States used imperialist forces to oppress East Asians and exploit East Asians. At that time, they also used hypocritical words to talk about humanity and peace to East Asians. In fact, they wanted to eliminate the resistance to exploitation and eliminate the struggles caused by East Asians' resistance to oppression under the guise of humanity and peace. Now, most East Asians have become aware that it is no different from surrendering and waiting for death to talk about humanity and peace with the profit-only British and Americans. Therefore, they have all risen up to follow our friendly country Japan in the struggle to defeat Britain and the United States, or hope that the spiritual unity that China and Manchukuo will implement is a unity based on morality, with loving one's own country and loving one's neighbors as the starting point of unity. Use this method of unity to achieve the goal of loving East Asia together and uniting together. Only this kind of spiritual unity is a true and permanent unity, can exert common strength, and can maintain permanent friendly relations.</p>
<p>In addition to spiritual unity, the second is economic unity. China and Manchukuo are connected by land. For a long time, the economy has been intercommunication. Now, as members of the East Asian Axis and partners in building the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, we must, of course, make the economic relations of intercommunication and complementary strengths and weaknesses more close and smoother. In the future, China should supply the shortage of Manchukuo with surplus products, and at the same time, it is hoped that Manchukuo will do the same. The two countries should not only exchange what they have and make up for each other's shortcomings in terms of products, but also be able to further form thorough cooperation in production and trade to achieve the goal of economic unity. If this can be done, not only China, Manchukuo, and our friendly country Japan will benefit, but all countries and nations in East Asia and European friendly countries can benefit greatly from the economic unity of China and Manchukuo. The work of this kind of economic unity is naturally complex and difficult, and cannot be achieved overnight. It is hoped that the talented people of China, Manchukuo, and our friendly country Japan can contribute more opinions and study more methods to make the relationship between China and Manchukuo stronger and closer due to the implementation of economic unity. If this is the case, the East Asian Axis can also become stronger, and our contribution to the Greater East Asia War will certainly be more than it is now. In addition to the method of spiritual unity and economic unity, there is cultural unity. A country has a country's special customs, habits, cultural relics, and systems, which is to say that a country has a country's culture. Therefore, it is more difficult to implement cultural unity and cultural integration between countries, but this difficulty does not exist in China and Manchukuo, because China and Manchukuo have a long history of relations and a long-term racial mixture, which has created a common culture between the two countries. If we can develop this point and promote it, then China and Manchukuo will not only be mutually communicating cultures, but also jointly developing culture, and jointly developing the same culture. Being of the same culture and the same race is enough to promote close unity between countries, and the same culture is more likely to integrate the relations and feelings of the two countries' citizens, making unity more consolidated and friendship more enhanced.</p>
<p>What I have talked about above is nothing more than methods to increase unity. The purpose of my visit to your country this time is to hope to implement these methods to enhance friendship and strengthen unity. The Greater East Asia War that is currently underway is related to the life and death of all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia, and we cannot but strengthen unity. Moreover, there is even greater work to be done in the future to build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, which requires even greater unity, and to create permanent unity. The more solid the unity, the stronger the power to build East Asia. The stronger the power to build East Asia, the sooner the date of realizing the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia will be. The citizens of China, Manchukuo, and other countries in East Asia naturally need to unite with neighboring countries in order to restore their own countries; in order to protect East Asia and prosper East Asia, it is even more necessary to strengthen mutual unity. As long as all ethnic groups and countries in East Asia can become a unity as solid as iron, they can generate a force as hot as fire. Only this kind of force can destroy the old forces dominated by Britain and the United States and create a new East Asian order in which all countries and ethnic groups get what they deserve."</p>

<h3>Allied Front Encounters Major Rift - Britain and Poland Primed to Collude for Countermeasures - Rumor has it that Britain Agrees to Soviet Stand and Requires Polish Cabinet to Reorganize - Soviets May Organize Free Polish Army with Poles in Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - When the Soviet government declared its severance of relations with the Polish government-in-exile, it did not notify Britain, the United States and other countries in advance. Therefore, when Moscow broadcast the matter, the anti-Axis countries were very surprised. The British government also consulted with the US government and decided to mediate. The Polish government-in-exile convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th to discuss countermeasures, but did not issue any statement after the cabinet meeting, only saying "a new situation has occurred." On the afternoon of the 27th, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and Foreign Minister Raczynski visited British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden, respectively, and the four of them continued to negotiate at the Prime Minister's residence. At the same time, US Ambassador to the UK Winant also met with Churchill. According to reliable sources, Churchill pointed out at the meeting of British and Polish leaders that a major crisis had occurred between the anti-Axis countries, and strongly advocated a united front, requesting the Polish government-in-exile to exercise self-restraint. After the meeting, Churchill reported the decisions of the meeting to Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky. It is generally believed that Churchill will take a second step, and it is believed that the British and Polish governments may issue a statement today. Reuters has also been vigorously promoting the British government's mediation, and Soviet-Polish relations have eased slightly. According to a Reuters report, the German-language newspaper in Moscow reported on the 26th that the Soviet Union and Poland had severed diplomatic relations, but by the night of the 27th, the words "severed" had been changed to "suspended," and it was said that Poland had not yet formally decided to withdraw its ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - It is rumored that the Polish government-in-exile convened a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th and resolved to issue a statement, which was submitted to the British Foreign Secretary by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is generally believed that in order to ease the crisis in the anti-Axis camp, the British government will require the reorganization of the cabinet of the Polish government-in-exile and the dismissal of anti-Soviet nationalists.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Stephani News Agency reported that, according to Swedish newspapers' receipt of news from London, qualified British sources have not shown partiality since the Soviet-Polish severance of relations. It seems that the Polish side has no other way but to organize a new government, hoping to restore relations with Moscow and make considerable concessions in order to reach an agreement on the various outstanding territorial issues between the two countries. Although the British side obviously does not want to favor any party in order to avoid aggravating the already serious situation, the London government seems to want to agree with Moscow's position in accordance with the principle that "might makes right." What is even more noteworthy is that on the day before the Soviet-Polish severance of relations, Czech President Benes was still broadcasting on the radio that "the Czech Republic trusts in the unity of British-Soviet relations."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, the Soviet Union has not received any news about which country will take care of all Polish interests in the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with the London Polish government-in-exile.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press reporter in Washington claimed that political figures in Washington yesterday expressed the opinion that Moscow's decision to sever relations with the London Polish government-in-exile may imply that Stalin hopes that Britain and the United States will officially recognize the Soviet Union's right to seize some territories on its western border on the day of the anti-Axis victory, and that the Soviet Union is now attempting to pressure Britain and the United States to open a second front in Europe. Some people in Washington even said that the Soviet-Polish severance of relations was a diplomatic failure for British Prime Minister Churchill, saying that Churchill should have taken a more realistic attitude towards the Polish government-in-exile. The reporter believes that the Soviet Union may organize a "Free Polish Army" with Poles in the Soviet Union and declare that only Poles who are willing to join the Red Army to fight for the liberation of Poland have the right to return to Poland.</p>
<h3>America Feels Unease Over Soviet-Polish Rupture; Hull Has No Comment Yet</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Washington, April 28th - Diplomatic circles in Washington are deeply concerned about the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, as both countries are members of the so-called Allied nations. The State Department expressed regret, but due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation, it did not mention the nature of the Soviet-Polish discord. Yesterday, at a press briefing, when asked about reports from London that Britain and the United States would mediate, Secretary of State Hull replied that he would not comment extensively before the matter had developed definitively, but that the State Department would make a statement once the situation evolved. After meeting with Under Secretary of State Welles, Polish Ambassador Ciechanowski told reporters that he had not received official confirmation of the Soviet action and could not comment. Qualified political observers speculate that the next step will be action taken by the United States. At that time, the fundamental differences between the United States and the Soviet Union will become clearer. Observers said that Prime Minister Eden's attitude is particularly intriguing at this time, because if Eden sides with the Soviet Union, the governments of many countries occupied by the Axis powers will likely rise up and fight in alliance against the Axis, and Eden will be unable to cope. Observers continued that since the Soviet-Polish agreement is effectively invalid, it is questionable whether the Anglo-Soviet agreement will follow suit. It is reported that the Soviet-Polish rift began brewing as early as February, when Moscow authorities told foreign reporters that certain Eastern European regions incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939-40 would never be returned. By the end of February, Polish government-in-exile officials said that Poland's borders should be based on the regions where Polish forces alone withstood the German offensive in September 1939. However, the immediate cause of the Soviet-Polish discord was the Polish government's request for the International Red Cross to investigate the serious case reported by the Germans of Soviet forces murdering Polish prisoners of war near Smolensk. The Soviet side replied that the rumors were clearly fabricated by the Hitler faction, and that the Nazis were responsible for killing the Polish officers, and that the Germans were engaged in propaganda to create discord between the Soviet Union and its allies, into whose trap the Polish government had fallen. At the same time, various circles in the United States are deeply concerned about the legal status of thousands of Polish nationals residing in Soviet territory, which may lead to serious disputes.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Ministry Comments on Soviet-Polish Incident: A Disgrace Among the Entire Anti-Axis Alliance</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the recent incident between the Soviet government and the Polish government-in-exile in London is a disgrace among the entire anti-Axis front. This matter is sufficient to show that Britain has no chance to use its power to curb Soviet territorial demands. The British comments on the Soviet-Polish break can already be regarded as the British government's inability to implement its will on Soviet policy. The international political spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry, when meeting with the press yesterday, first read out Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's note of severance. The spokesman summarized the German comments on this development, saying, "Stalin has severed relations with Poland because he does not want the Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union to stay and raise unpleasant questions. The Polish ambassador has raised extremely unpleasant questions for the Soviet Union regarding the Katyn Forest massacre and the whereabouts of 1.5 million Poles deported by the Soviet Union." The spokesman added that 694,000 Polish prisoners of war in German hands are still alive, but the fate of 1.5 million Poles in Soviet hands is unknown. The German view is that Stalin's severance of relations with Poland is actually intended to let Britain and the United States know that he does not want to participate in British and American discussions on territorial issues. Stalin still regards Poland as a country within the Soviet military border. Stalin's attitude towards General Sikorski has shown that he does not want to participate in any agreement that would change this situation. The spokesman mentioned the Soviet claim that Germany was cooperating with General Sikorski, saying that he had no suitable words to deny this preposterous statement. Many countries and nationalities in Europe, as well as some neutral countries, should take Poland as a lesson and understand that only the victory of German and its allies' weapons can protect European countries and nationalities from suffering the same fate as Poland in the hands of the Soviet Union. If Britain cannot do anything about its reputation, then it is unbelievable that it can stop the Soviet Union from excessively entering Europe.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues East of Cape Bon; British Forces Attempt Breakthrough Towards Tunis</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - According to a special military correspondent from the Overseas Chinese News Agency, the battle for the Tunisian bridgehead continues, its intensity fluctuating, which is a characteristic of the war. On Monday morning, there was fierce fighting on the entire western front, but from afternoon to evening, the fighting clearly eased slightly. On Tuesday, the fighting became active again, and the fighting in several decisive areas gradually intensified, especially in the coastal area east of Cape Bon, where General Anderson is fighting with mixed French forces. The American forces are attacking eastward and northward on the roads from Sejnane and Djebel to the Gafsa region. Reports from the anti-Axis side that American artillery has already opened fire on German positions in Mateur are still premature. On Monday, the American forces had not yet reached the Sidi Nsir station. The operational plan of the American Second Corps may be to not only launch a frontal attack on Sidi Nsir but also to turn south towards the Medjez el Bab-Tebourba road or attack the mountains on that road. In the past few days, British forces have also launched multiple attacks on this mountain range from the south and southeast, but it is not yet known how much progress they have made. An important part of the mountain range must still be in German hands, otherwise the British forces would have made greater progress towards Tebourba. Further south, a British tank column advanced almost to Pont du Fahs on Saturday, but was repulsed by German forces on Sunday and suffered heavy losses. Its remnants have been reorganized in the area south of Medjez el Bab and around Goubellat, with significant reinforcements of infantry. Between Djebel Ang and Djebel Mansour, the central division of General Anderson's forces, although suffering heavy losses during the Easter holidays, still possesses significant striking power and numerical superiority. This preparation is largely composed of elite British troops. The central division of the British First Army alone has nine divisions. The British forces may attempt another breakthrough towards Tunis, either towards Pont du Fahs, Djebel Zaghouan, or directly through Tebourba. This attempt will be as fierce as the one repulsed by the Axis forces on Sunday. Although the German forces were able to defend successfully during the Easter holidays, it cannot yet be said that the tension of the battle has eased. Although the British Eighth Army was quite quiet during the holiday, it must be using this time to strengthen its combat power in all aspects and will still play an important role in future operations. On Sunday, General Montgomery only launched local attacks in the area between Enfidaville and Takrouna, with the aim of seizing several peaks in the mountains held by the Axis forces. In the past few days, General Montgomery has reorganized his troops and may shift his main force to the left flank. Axis reconnaissance teams report that a large number of powerful British and American tanks are concentrated in the Djedeida area, which may indicate that General Montgomery will attempt to break through northwest towards Pont du Fahs in cooperation with the central division of the First Army.</p>
<h3>Only Minor Land Contact on Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, April 28th - On the Eastern Front, in the Kuban River estuary region, German-Romanian forces have established a victorious position, and Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses, making it impossible for them to recover. There has been no large-scale land combat in recent days, only small-scale air combat. However, German forces in the Leningrad region suddenly launched a counter-offensive in a certain area on the afternoon of the 26th, penetrating deep into Soviet lines, forcing the Soviet forces to retreat. To recapture this position, Soviet forces counter-attacked twice on the 27th, but were repulsed by heavy German artillery fire. In addition, German forces around Leningrad shelled important military facilities in the city on the 27th, achieving significant results. In addition, the offensive launched by the German air force, centered on the Kuban River region, has become increasingly fierce. On the 27th, the Soviet newspaper also stated that the German air force repeatedly bombed from the Kerch Peninsula and the Taman Peninsula. Soviet forces in Krasnodar are urgently requesting the deployment of a large number of fighter aircraft for reinforcement.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, April 28th - It is reported that German forces shot down 17 Soviet aircraft on the Eastern Front on the 26th, 12 of which were shot down by the air force and 5 by anti-aircraft artillery. All German aircraft returned to base.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Helsinki, April 28th - Stefani News Agency reports that Finnish military communique says that on the land front, for the last twenty-four hours, there has been reconnaissance activity and occasional shelling. In the evening, one Soviet bomber attempted to fly over the Finnish capital, but was repelled by Finnish anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Aviation Bombards South Pacific Islands; Japanese Aircraft Fully Utilize Superior Tactics, Shooting Down Six American New-Type Fighters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - Since the beginning of this month, Japanese naval aviation units have been fiercely attacking American air bases in Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Oro Bay, and Milne Bay, crushing enemy attempts to counterattack. On the night of the 23rd of this month, naval aviation units launched a long-range bombing raid on Funafuti Island, the main island of the British Ellice Islands, for the first time, dropping heavy bombs on American airfields, warehouses, and various military facilities, causing nine fires that burned fiercely. All Japanese aircraft returned safely after completing their mission. The US Navy also admitted that the area was heavily damaged. This Japanese bombing of Funafuti Island is of great significance for threatening communications between the United States and Australia. On the 25th, Japanese aircraft encountered new-type American fighters over Kukuru Island, south of New Georgia Island, and shot down six of them. In this battle, Japanese aircraft fully utilized their superior tactics.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 today: 1. Japanese naval aviation units attacked enemy military facilities on Funafuti Island in the Ellice Islands on the 23rd of this month, inflicting heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. 2. On the 25th of this month, during an air battle over Kakugai Island in the Solomon Islands, Japanese naval aviation units shot down six enemy aircraft. There were no Japanese aircraft losses.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, April 28th - According to a Washington report by the Stefani News Agency, the US Navy announced on the 26th that Japanese aviation units bombed American positions on Funafuti Island in the British Ellice Islands on the 22nd of this month. American troops and military facilities were damaged. It is reported that the British Ellice Islands are located 800 nautical miles southeast of the Marshall Islands, between 5 and 10.5 degrees south latitude and 176 and 180 degrees east longitude. The total area of the islands is 14 square miles. According to a 1936 survey, the population of the islands was 4,113. The archipelago is composed of nine small islands with a very low elevation, only a few meters above sea level. The archipelago was discovered by the Spaniard Maurelle in 1781, and the southern part of the islands was discovered by British Captain Peter in 1819. It became British territory in 1892. In Funafuti Island, which was bombed by Japanese aircraft this time, there are British colonial government and American military bases.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, April 28th - The US Navy announced that Japanese naval aviation units bombed Funafuti Island. At the same time, a US Navy spokesman also stated that American forces had occupied the Ellice Islands without bloodshed. The US Naval Headquarters in the South Pacific announced that a strong fleet of American naval cruisers and destroyers had sailed into the Ellice Islands and that the British islands southwest of the Kandavu Island, north of Fiji, were under American control. However, the US Navy did not notify Britain or obtain the British government's consent for this action, so the British Navy was deeply surprised after learning about this matter.</p>
<h3>Announcement to the Italian People by Hidaka</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, April 28th - The new Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiro Hidaka, upon arriving here yesterday to take up his post, issued a message to the Italian people, stating in brief that although Japan and Italy are far apart, he comes to Italy with the sincere hope of further strengthening the close ties between the two countries. Our two countries are now fighting shoulder to shoulder with unwavering determination to defeat the common enemy and achieve victory, and to promote a just and prosperous peace. Japan, Italy, Germany, and other countries participating in the Tripartite Pact will forever form an unbreakable union to strike at those with ambitious plans. We are confident that with our joint efforts, we will achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Enemy Submarine Attacks Japanese Red Cross Ship</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th - According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base, a Japanese Red Cross ship was attacked by an enemy submarine with torpedoes at 3:35 PM on the 25th of this month while sailing in the South China Sea. Fortunately, the captain and crew responded calmly and escaped the danger. The ship returned to a certain location that night. The Red Cross ship was clearly marked with the Red Cross symbol and it was daylight, so the enemy's illegal attack can be said to be the height of brutality. Previously, Japanese Red Cross ships had been bombed by enemy aircraft and attacked by enemy submarines one after another. Recently, there have been enemy aircraft bombings. This attack is the sixth one. Such barbarity of the enemy is truly an abomination to both gods and men.</p>
<h3>Medan Muslims Hold Prayer Meeting to Destroy Britain and America</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Medan, April 28th - The million Muslims of all of Sumatra deeply understand the liberation of them from Dutch shackles by the Japanese army and are especially grateful for the moderate policies of the military government, which has allowed Islam to restore its original position. To express this gratitude and to pray for the completion of the war, a prayer meeting of Sumatran Muslims to destroy Britain and America will be held in the square in front of the Medan government. It is also scheduled to invite Governor-General Nakajima Tokaishu and other relevant officials to attend for guidance. Tens of thousands of Muslims, including leaders and representatives from various provinces, will participate. The agenda of the meeting will begin with a congratulatory speech by Governor-General Nakajima, followed by a resolution to be presented to the Japanese government and the headquarters of the Muslim League. Finally, there will be a prayer for the complete destruction of Britain and America and the completion of the Greater East Asia War, emphasizing the mission that Muslims should bear.</p>
<h3>Serious Food Shortages in the United States</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, April 28th - The Stefani News Agency quoted Washington reports that although the US government has taken restrictive measures, the food problem throughout the United States is becoming more serious. A lack of essential goods is now felt in all aspects. Competent government officials declare that the lack of essential products has increased by 30% in the past nine months.</p>
<h3>Overview of Europe's "Second Front"</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Reuters Correspondent in Lisbon, 16th) As the Tunisian campaign intensifies, the European war situation has finally entered a critical period. The recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini can be seen as a preparation to discuss how to properly handle any situation that may arise regarding the Tunisian front. The British and Americans also believe that the opportunity to land on the European continent has finally matured and are eyeing it intently. The Anglo-American offensive on the European continent can be seen as potentially unfolding towards Italy, namely Sicily or Sardinia, and it can also be anticipated that it may unfold towards Crete, Greece, or the Black Sea coast. However, in any case, the new phase of the European war, which is sure to come, will center on the Eastern Front and how the Anglo-American Second Front issue is related to it. Therefore, the Axis's countermeasures, and their primary efforts, are also closely aligned with these two. Putting the former aside for the moment, if the latter, as boasted by the British and Americans, can occur in the near future, then what kind of situation do the various countries that are candidates for the Second Front have? A general overview is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) The Balkans</p>
<p>Axis intelligence frequently reports Anglo-American military offensive preparations on Cyprus. On the one hand, intelligence from Ankara also states that what the Axis is most concerned about is the Balkans. Recently, special air force units composed of German, Hungarian, and Romanian troops have been formed, and it is planned to deploy a new division of ○ troops in the Balkans to strengthen countermeasures against an American landing. However, there is no acknowledgment of the fact that German troops are moving back to the Balkans. It is only said that air forces are being sent to Bulgaria, and artillery units are concentrating along the Black Sea and Aegean coasts. The British, on the other hand, believe that there are ○ divisions stationed on Crete. In addition, there are also considerable strong defenses in various ports along the Greek coast and the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.</p>
<p>Since the meeting between Head of State Hitler and King Boris III of Bulgaria, Bulgaria's movements have been closely watched. However, the country has not changed its policy of cooperating with the Axis to defend the Balkans.</p>
<p>After the start of the German-Soviet war, Germany entrusted the control of Greece to Italy, focusing its own efforts on the Eastern Front. However, in recent months, Germany has been responsible for coastal defense, while the Italian army has generally been responsible for the interior of Greece. Furthermore, regarding the anti-Axis Greek guerrillas, the ones commanded by Major Deoulas in the Macedonia area are the most powerful, repeatedly challenging the Bulgarian army. It is said that they even have liaison officers with the anti-Axis Yugoslav guerrillas of Mihailović. In addition, there are also Greek troops scattered in the Pindus, Olympus, northern Sparta, and Crete, totaling about 30,000 armed soldiers. It is said that there is also a plan to establish a unified general staff.</p>
<p>The former Yugoslavia is a nest for Mihailović's army, guerrillas, communist guerrillas, etc., and the situation is extremely complex.</p>
<p>In Albania, there are also considerable anti-Axis guerrillas secretly active, and there have recently been reports of attacks on Italian troops. It is also reported that Italy has recently replaced its governor, established a new party called the "Greater Albania Defense Corps," and is forming an Albanian self-defense force, consolidating Albania's new defense system.</p>
<p>With the progress of the North African campaign, the defense of the Italian coast has been particularly strengthened. Although the British and Americans are clamoring to seize the opportunity to wage war against Italy, they are fully aware of the operational difficulties.</p>
<p>(2) The Italian Coast and the French Coast. Due to the urgency of the Tunisian war situation, the defense of the Italian coast and the two islands of Sardinia and Sicily is considered the most important. The recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini can be seen as focusing on strengthening Italy's defense. On the one hand, the British and Americans are trying to stir up the hearts of the Italian people and intensify the alienation between Germany and Italy. However, they ultimately feel that there is no anti-fascist force within Italy that can be exploited.</p>
<p>The defense of France is under the command of General Rundstedt as the supreme commander. As for the border area of Romagna, it is under the jurisdiction of the Belgian occupation authorities. General Rundstedt is mainly responsible for the defense of the English Channel, the Bay of Biscay coast, and the Mediterranean coast. In administrative terms, the whole country is under the supervision of German officials, while formally, French officials implement it. However, since the deployment of German troops, the distinction between occupied and unoccupied zones has disappeared, but the political difference remains, and the German army respects it. The German and Italian troops stationed in southern France are called the "operational army," not the "occupation army."</p>
<p>In relation to the Second Front, the most important area on the northern French coast is the English Channel coast from Dunkirk to Saint-Nazaire. Germany is now making every effort to consolidate the fortifications for defense against landing. It is said that the defenses extend from the coast to the interior, reaching a depth of 120 to 150 miles, preparing for an immediate counterattack when Anglo-American forces land.</p>
<p>On the Mediterranean coast, the fifty miles of coastline between Narbonne and Montpellier is considered the most dangerous. It is said that the residents of this area have all been ordered to evacuate, and it is reported that the defenses of the ports of Marseille and Toulon have been particularly strengthened. Regarding the domestic situation, the British are difficult to make arbitrary speculations. However, there is no organization whatsoever for anti-German forces.</p>
<p>For example, British newspapers also admit: "It is wrong to say that they like the British and Americans because they dislike the Germans. Therefore, even if the Anglo-American forces land, the French will not automatically become friends of the Anglo-Americans." This was proven by the Dieppe raid last year. Furthermore, the resistance of the French to the Anglo-American forces in Syria, Madagascar, and North Africa, the self-destruction of the French Navy, and the refusal of the French fleet in Alexandria to merge with the anti-Axis forces are all clear ideas.</p>
<p>(3) The Netherlands and Belgium</p>
<p>The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported on the German defense installations in the Netherlands and Belgium as follows: "In order to set up strongholds, minefields, tank ditches, etc., the German army has demolished civilian houses along the coast. Therefore, even if the Anglo-American forces land, they will not be able to use any cover." It is said that the residents of The Hague coastline have been ordered to evacuate, and civilian houses and roads have been almost completely obliterated. It is said that the delta area of the three rivers Rhine, Maas, and Scheldt, from North Holland to Vlissingen, is the most heavily defended. The German civil affairs officer stationed in the Netherlands is Mr. Seyss-Inquart. Initially, he adopted a form of military occupation, but recently he has concentrated all administrative powers in his hands.</p>
<p>The German military defense on the Belgian coast is no less than that of the Netherlands, and it is being gradually strengthened. Residents on the coast are prohibited from going more than three miles out to sea, the depth of the defense line is being extended, and the restricted area has been expanded from the coast twenty miles to Zaltbommel. Furthermore, it is said that the old fortresses of Namur, Liège, etc., have been completely restored. German administration in the occupied territory, unlike in the Netherlands, is directly managed by General Halgensen under Marshal Rundstedt.</p>
<p>(4) Norway and Denmark</p>
<p>The American forces entered Iceland the year before last, and the Anglo-American gaze has long been focused on Norway. Therefore, Germany strengthened the defense of this country earlier than other occupied territories. The coastal areas of cities such as Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, and Narvik are particularly heavily fortified. In particular, it is said that large cannons and other weapons have been moved from the Maginot Line to the interior, forming a strong fortress comparable to the Siegfried Line. The civil affairs officer is the thorough Nazi Party member, Terboven, and is assisted by the National Union Party, headed by the famous Major Quisling. The party has 40,000 members and an army of several thousand called the Hird Party.</p>
<p>In Denmark, in addition to the mainland of Jutland, the most important of its 500 islands are Zealand and Funen. The German army has ○0,000 in Jutland, ○0,000 in Zealand, and ○0,000 in Funen. The supreme commander of the German army is General Hanneken, who was appointed last October. In civil affairs, the minister stationed in Copenhagen, Werner Best, acts as a consultant to the Danish government.</p>
<p>Germany's policy towards Denmark is to make the country a model for the new order. Therefore, unlike other occupied territories, it strives to realize Danish autonomy. The representative of the pro-German faction in Denmark is the current Prime Minister Erik Scavenius. (Ding: Translated from the April 19th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Investigate Speculation and Hoarding in Shanghai; Original Text of Investigation Report; Han Gongbei's Purchase of Materials Disrupts the Market; Management Methods and Bank Accounts Are All Verified</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) In the past, in order to thoroughly investigate general speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, the National Government specifically ordered Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo, Minister of Industry Yuan Yuquan, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Zhao Shuyong, and Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association Chen Yunwen, etc., to jointly investigate impartially. Regarding major officials of financial institutions who engaged in speculative transactions, if they were government-run, they were to be temporarily suspended from business and immediately reorganized. If they were privately run, they were to be closed down immediately. Regarding those who engaged in speculative transactions, manipulated market prices, and disrupted the market, regardless of who they were, they were to be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for a special sentence, and the seized materials were to be confiscated in full. After receiving the order, Chen and others went to Shanghai to conduct a strict investigation and reported the results of the investigation truthfully on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. After the Chairman received the report, he immediately ordered a punishment. Han Gongbei was severely punished by the court for hoarding a large amount of important materials, manipulating prices, and disrupting the market through an unregistered company. Futong Bank was suspected of major involvement and was temporarily suspended from business and personnel were sent to investigate. Other matters that have not been investigated will continue to be carried out by the competent departments, so that unscrupulous merchants will know how to restrain themselves and prices can tend to be stable. Details have been seen in previous reports.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Report</p>
<p>The original text of the investigation report is extracted below: "Regarding the confidential report, Zhishuo and others were dispatched to thoroughly investigate the case of hoarding important materials for speculation in Shanghai. We have followed the instructions and gone to Shanghai for on-site investigations and listened to opinions from all parties. The results of the investigation are presented in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the case of Han Gongbei, general manager of Zhenhua Company, hoarding a large amount of cotton yarn, according to the accounts of the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Local Bank, there are three accounts listed under the names of Hua Ji, Zhenhua Company, and Kejia Gongbei. From March 15th to April 1st, a total of 26.71 million yuan was paid out. An investigation of the accounts of Jianghai Bank also revealed two accounts under the names of Hua Ji and Han Gongbei. During the above-mentioned period, a total of 21.73 million yuan was paid out. According to Han Gongbei, the company is still in the process of being established and is planning to engage in the silk and cloth business after it is established. Therefore, from March 19th to 25th, he successively purchased 870 pieces of cotton yarn and 515 pieces of cotton cloth on the black market, worth approximately 28 million yuan. He still plans to continue buying in order to use them for the operation of the company after it is established.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the case of Futong Bank, an investigation of the bank revealed a temporary overdraft account, which listed 12 million yuan under the name of Zhenhua. In addition, there was a 2.2 million yuan remittance of artificial silk mortgage from Zhenhua to Qingfeng in the mortgage account. Regardless of whether it involves Han Gongbei's speculation, the responsibility for violating the bank's business regulations cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the case of Limin Bank, an investigation of the bank revealed that its capital was 3 million yuan. From March 25th to April 1st, payments of more than 86.4 million yuan were made, which seemed to be suspected of fueling speculation.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned completed investigations, Han Gongbei purchased important materials through Zhenhua Company, which is still in preparation and has not been registered, disrupting the market, and there is solid evidence that he should be punished according to the law. Futong Bank accepted mortgages and accommodated temporary overdrafts, all of which are related to Han Gongbei and are suspected of major involvement, so it seems that it should be temporarily suspended from business for investigation. Limin Bank has a capital of 3 million yuan, and more than 80 million yuan has been paid out in 16 days since March 15th. After inquiring, most of them were payments for withdrawals by depositors. Whether there is any suspicion will be further investigated. Regarding the other cases that should be investigated, a plan for thoroughly investigating and handling speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai has been drawn up and submitted to you for review. We are now proceeding with the investigation, but the scope is large and it will take a long time to complete it in a short period of time. The spreading rumors have caused panic in the financial and industrial circles. The trend of withdrawing cash has increased, and the funds have become shorter day by day. The banks are already feeling the difficulty, and the impact is even more worrying. It is proposed that the above-mentioned clearly investigated cases be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for separate discussion and punishment, and announced to the public immediately to maintain law and order and warn the cunning. This is our duty and we should submit it for your review and implementation.</p>
<p>Temporary Conclusion</p>
<p>The investigation progress of Zhishuo and others has come to a temporary conclusion. Regarding the remaining cases that should be investigated, we will continue to handle them or hand them over to the competent authorities for separate action in accordance with the plan for thoroughly investigating and handling speculation and hoarding of important materials in Shanghai. Please merge and submit them for your guidance. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman. Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo, Deputy Minister of Industry Yuan Yuquan, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Zhao Shuyong, and Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association Chen Yunwen, April 13th, 32nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Closed Today</h3>
<p>Today (29th) is the Spring Festival, and the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and the member banks and shops of the Shanghai Bankers Association, as well as the trust companies, are closed for one day as usual. Business will resume as usual from tomorrow (30th).</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Civic Welfare</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>Shen Bao recently published an article "A Discussion on the Application of the Wealth Preservation Method" written by Mr. Yang Yusheng. It should be based on the Wealth Preservation Method written by Mr. Nie Yuntai, and it aims to promote and supplement its meaning. However, the article quotes my lecture on civic welfare twice, and contains a lot of excessive praise, which I dare not accept. My lecture is nothing more than promoting the understanding of citizens from the perspective of legitimate welfare. Therefore, there is a conclusion of "no disaster is happiness, no harm is benefit." These are all old clichés. In terms of the word "happiness," the Four Books, except for Mencius's quotation of the poem "Seek more happiness for yourself," have no such word. The most obvious one is the saying in the Book of Documents "Five Blessings." The so-called five blessings are: First, longevity. How long does a person have to live to be called longevity? According to custom, it should not be called longevity until the age of sixty. Moreover, there is no difference between the longevity of life and the longevity of reputation. Therefore, Yan Hui's thirty-two years is also longevity, and the great age of Robber Zhi is not longevity. Aren't those who celebrate their thirtieth or fortieth birthdays now taking their thirtieth or fortieth years as satisfaction and stopping there? Second, wealth. Wealth does not only refer to money. More reading means rich knowledge, good friends mean rich emotions, sufficient books mean rich collections, and virtuous descendants mean rich population. If you only know how to be a miser, can those who have fallen from ministers to servants and those whose mansions have become overgrown with weeds be called happiness? Third, health. Health is certainly the ultimate joy of being free from disaster and illness. However, if hands and feet are healthy but lazy to move, and the body is strong but accustomed to fighting, disasters will inevitably arise and become useless. Fourth, love of virtue. Why is the love of virtue included in the five blessings? There is indeed a wonderful reason for this. For example, if I have the ability to help the poor and sick, then I am blessed. Conversely, I am not blessed. Those in the world who have the ability to help others but abandon it are no different from cutting themselves off from happiness. Fifth, a good end. There are two reasons why people cannot die well. One is encountering disaster, dying with grievances. The other is causing disaster, dying from wrongdoing. Neither can be called happiness. However, people like Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa, one was killed and the other committed suicide, because they were voluntary, and although their bodies died, their names will last forever. Their names are immortal, and their happiness is greater and longer than those who die of old age. Furthermore, in terms of the word "benefit," Confucius rarely speaks of benefit. Mencius said: "Why must you say benefit? There is also benevolence and righteousness!" Why did Confucius and Mencius despise benefit? Because benefit has two meanings: narrow and broad. The narrow sense of benefit is called self-interest, and the broad sense of benefit is beneficial to both others and oneself. Moreover, the essence of benefit varies with people's positions. Scholars take cultivation as benefit, farmers take harvest as benefit, workers take manufacturing as benefit, and merchants take trade as benefit. Therefore, Confucius said: "Benefit them by what they consider beneficial." For example, if a beggar earns ten gold coins in a day, other beggars who do not earn ten gold coins will definitely consider him to have great benefit. However, if a rich merchant who earns more gold coins every day sees it, ten gold coins are not worth his glance. People in the world do not measure their own abilities, forget their duties, and eat greedily. Do they know how to return? The above is an excerpt from a section of my lecture, which I would like to share with readers.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Tencho-setsu (The Emperor's Birthday)</h3>
<p>Today is Tencho-setsu, a day of national celebration in the friendly country of Japan.</p>
<p>Tencho-setsu is the anniversary of the birth of the Emperor of Japan, so the date of Tencho-setsu is determined by the birth date of each successive emperor. April 29th is the birthday of the current Emperor Showa, so this day is designated as Tencho-setsu. This holiday is equivalent to the Wanshou Festival (Emperor's Birthday) in our history.</p>
<p>On this day, all parts of the country, all agencies, organizations, schools, etc., take a holiday to celebrate the Emperor's birthday.</p>
<h3>Programs for Shanghai Japanese Residents to Celebrate</h3>

<h3>Promotion of Naval Captain Oya, of the Japanese Embassy Office</h3>
<p>Naval Captain Goichi Oya of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office has been ordered to be promoted. During his tenure, he has made many contributions. He first served in the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, and then served in the reorganized Embassy Office. He has worked diligently in politics. It is said that he will soon go to take up his new post.</p>
<p>It is reported that he arrived in October of the 15th year of Showa (1940), and successively assisted Chief Tsuda, Chief Ota, Minister Tajiri, and Vice-Ministers Oyama and Ochiai, sparing no effort in promoting the construction and administration of Central China. Mr. Oya is of a quiet nature, not good at socializing, and full of work spirit. Even when he was ill, he would definitely force himself to work. His colleagues were amazed by this.</p>
<p>Mr. Oya also often handled official business on weekends and holidays, and was very enthusiastic about the construction of Central China. On the 26th, before receiving the order, Mr. Oya gave a short speech at the Embassy Office, saying:</p>
<p>"I am diligent by nature, but I have made no special contributions during my service. In general, the advocacy movement and cultural administration here are on the right track, so I hope that everyone will be able to fully promote this work after I leave in the future."</p>
<h3>Establishment of the West District Banking Association</h3>
<p>After the branches of the Central Reserve, Shanghai, Jiaotong, Jincheng, and Zhongnan banks initiated the establishment of the Shanghai West District Banking Association, after careful organization, it has been completed. Thirty banks, including Zhejiang Xingye, China, Continental, and Xinhua, participated. A first luncheon was held at the liaison office of the Yuhua Salt Company on Tonglu Road the other day.

<h3>Shanghai Clearing Association Announcement: Encouraging the Public to Report Crimes Confidentially; Procedures for Confidential Reports Established and Handled by Political Work Groups</h3>
<p>To make it easier for the public to report crimes, the Shanghai Clearing Association has instructed political work groups to produce confidential report boxes, place them in various towns and cities, and establish procedures for submitting confidential reports to encourage public reporting. The original text of the announcement and the procedures for confidential reporting are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Original Announcement</p>

A set of procedures for the public to submit confidential reports has also been established and is being distributed along with this announcement. We hope that the public in all areas will assist the government wholeheartedly, abide by the provisions of these procedures, report truthfully, and not conceal anything. This is the announcement."</p>
<p>Procedures for Confidential Reporting</p>

<h3>After the Adoption of a Rationing System for Rice and Fuel, Life in Shanghai Gradually Returns to a State of Stability; the Overall Situation No Longer Shows Signs of Turmoil</h3>
<p>Well-informed sources believe that since the authorities adopted a rationing system for food and fuel in this city, the overall situation has transitioned from turmoil to stability. There have been no signs of any shortages in supply. Not only is the source continuously replenished and the reserves abundant, but the selling prices are also frequently declining, now presenting a stable state.</p>
<p>110,000 Bags of Rice Consumed Monthly</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from relevant sources that the two concession authorities have already completed the thirty-third phase of the grain rationing program, with a total of over 1.17 million bags of whole and broken rice sold. However, since September 21st of last year, household rice distribution has been changed to once every ten days. If calculated at two sheng of rice per person per period, the monthly rice consumption of the two concessions is 140,000 dan, equivalent to over 110,000 bags. Recently, the free transportation of rice and grain has been permitted, and the extra supply has increased sharply. The market situation has become extremely stable, and because citizens are accustomed to mixing grains, there is no longer the same intense demand for purchasing rice.</p>
<p>Fuel Supply Should Be Sustainable</p>
<p>Regarding the fuel needed for daily cooking by residents, such as coal, firewood, and charcoal, as well as the bituminous coal needed by various factories, the authorities have long been providing sufficient rations on a regular basis. Therefore, the trading situation is significantly different from the past. Currently, the authorities are actively clearing channels and finding ways to increase reserves, as well as fully rationing to various users. There is no fear of fuel shortages in the future. The fuel industry's organizational structure has now been adjusted, and it is expected that the market situation can be sustained and stable thereafter.</p>
<h3>Information Minister Hirota Delivers a Speech on the Future Progress of the Axis Powers in Warfare</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 28th) at 3:00 PM, Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office held a regular meeting with the Shanghai Chinese Press Corps on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, where he presented his observations on the global situation and the vigorous progress of the Axis powers in the future.</p>
<p>Reasons for Defeat</p>
<p>Information Minister Hirota first discussed the global war situation, paying particular attention to Tunisia in North Africa. "While the German and Soviet forces are engaged in fierce fighting, the recent severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland has suddenly occurred. Although this represents a development in the overall global war situation, the results of the Pacific war and its future development require special attention. Regarding the recent observations of the situation in the Greater East Asia War, the war in Burma and India has developed. Japanese troops are pressing the British forces from Burma and India, while the Japanese air force has long controlled the islands of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the south, posing a major threat to the US Navy." Minister Hirota then discussed the situation of the enemy countries, stating that General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British, American, and Chongqing allied forces, had explained the reasons for the British defeat in Burma and India as being due to unfavorable weather and a large number of British soldiers suffering from fatigue and illness. In the South Pacific operations, the Japanese forces have repeatedly achieved victories, posing a major threat to Australia. General Macarthur, the commander-in-chief of the Australian, British, and American allied forces, and General Blamey, along with Australian Prime Minister Curtin and Foreign Minister Evatt, jointly appealed to the United States to provide active assistance to defend Australia, otherwise it would be subject to major attacks by Japan.</p>
<p>Erroneous Views</p>
<p>He continued, "If we look at the current situation of Britain and the United States, their defensive position in the Pacific has not only not been strengthened, but the situation is becoming increasingly dire. We can see from the so-called global war strategy flaunted by the anti-Axis war command that they have no intention of strengthening the Pacific defense. They claim that the global war will be resolved after the European war is resolved first, attempting to win victory with full force. This point is a major error. Because the Allied countries have failed to recognize the reality of the war and underestimate the Axis powers, but in our view, this is not the case. If Britain and the United States can fight with full force, it will actually provide the Axis powers with a good opportunity to wait for work at leisure and deal them a head-on blow. At that time, the entire Allied front will collapse, without a doubt."</p>
<p>Controlling Weaknesses</p>
<p>"The biggest mistake of the anti-Axis powers is that they pride themselves on armchair strategy and are mutually wary. However, this is not the case on the Axis front. If the strategic right wing in Europe is under control, the left wing, Japan, will stand up to provide assistance and overcome all difficulties. This is a common practice in warfare to avoid being individually defeated by the Allied countries. Therefore, the Allied lineup is on the verge of splitting. In addition, there are countless problems in military equipment, and weaknesses are exposed without reservation, as clearly demonstrated in the South Pacific. In places such as India, Australia, and Chongqing, we will, in accordance with the common practices of warfare and the obligations of the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance, unanimously control the weaknesses of the Allied forces and rise up to fight. Therefore, there will be vigorous developments in the spring and summer. This point can be asserted."</p>
<h3>Sports: Chinese Mixed Football Team to Play St. Friends Team Today at 5 PM in Xuhui</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Mixed Football Team, in preparation for its expedition to North China, will hold a practice match with the strong Western team, St. Friends. Originally scheduled for a few days ago, it was postponed due to rain until today at 5 PM at the Xuhui Middle School field in Xujiahui.

With such talent and a well-organized lineup, it is no less than a transformed Hualian team. St. Friends is also not to be underestimated, with many brave and skilled players such as Fuen, Carroll, and Schultz, all well-known in the football world. With such evenly matched opponents, there is sure to be a hard-fought battle. Tickets are five yuan, and tickets sold previously are valid today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper was published at 7:40 PM</p>
<h3>Economic Affairs: Commentary on the Resumption of Business by Chinese Stock Firms</h3>
<p>The issue of the resumption of business by Chinese stock firms has been a matter of much anticipation since the Municipal Economic Bureau announced the handling of registration procedures for various Chinese stock firms and the issuance of business licenses to some stock companies. Everyone thought that the resolution of this long-pending issue was just around the corner. However, as news spread day after day, it eventually left people waiting in vain, and there has been no definite news of the formal resumption of the Chinese stock market.</p>
<p>Originally, the authorities, in view of the activities of speculators, temporarily banned the trading of Chinese stocks in order to prevent improper operations. This was a wise measure. After the ban, they actively engaged in the examination and registration of Chinese stock firms in order to promote the recovery of legitimate stock firms and the realization of a formal Chinese stock market. This was also a wise measure. Because the former was to prevent improper speculative behavior in society, and the latter was to safeguard legitimate investment activities in society. In fact, a stock market is almost a market possessed by any industrialized country in the world. In theory, the stage of modern economic evolution has already progressed from the era of materialism and monetary capitalism to the era of securities capitalism, because holding securities is tantamount to holding capital or property. Unfortunately, due to China's backward pre-war production and the semi-colonial nature of its economic structure, national enterprises and the Chinese stocks that supported them never really emerged. Since the Greater East Asia War, the situation of Chinese enterprises usurping the limelight has changed dramatically. Thus, Chinese national enterprises have begun to rise, and stocks of banks, pharmaceuticals, public utilities, culture, textile mills, department stores, and other industries have all flourished, almost as prosperous as the Tokyo stock market during the war. This is a manifestation of the development of national enterprises and an important factor in urban prosperity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities' efforts to examine and register Chinese stock firms in order to establish a formal and legitimate Chinese stock market, and not to give up eating for fear of choking, is indeed another wise measure. What we hope for is the thorough implementation of all wise measures, and not to allow any obstruction in any level of the executive agencies to prevent the thorough implementation of their wise intentions.</p>
<h3>Authorities Prevent Speculation and Hoarding by Supervising the Business of Trust Companies</h3>
<p>In order to prevent speculation and hoarding, the Ministry of Finance, after strictly managing the business of various banks and money shops, has decided to supervise trust companies in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies, stipulating that their business operations are limited to the following: (1) Property management, (2) Execution of wills and estate management, (3) Receipt and use of trust funds, (4) Underwriting or acquisition of government bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities, (5) Management of collateral and funds for corporate bonds and other stocks and bonds, (6) Acting as agent for registration of stocks and bonds, (7) Acting as agent for the sale and purchase of securities, (8) Acting as agent for safekeeping of securities, notes, contracts, and other valuables, (9) Acting as agent for real estate leasing and introducing real estate sales and mortgages, (10) Acting as agent for real estate transfer registration and tax payment, (11) Acting as agent for insurance, (12) Leasing safe deposit boxes and handling open and sealed safekeeping, (13) Handling liquidation and reorganization matters, (14) Handling credit guarantees, (15) Acting as agent for receiving and paying funds, (16) Other trust matters approved by the Ministry of Finance. However, with special approval from the Ministry, they may also engage in the following ancillary businesses: (1) Receiving deposits, (2) Providing loans, (3) Discounting bills, (4) Remittances or export financing, (5) Buying and selling securities and real estate, (6) Warehousing. At the same time, it is stipulated that trust companies shall not be shareholders of stores, banks, or other companies. When banks concurrently engage in trust business, the assets and liabilities of the trust department and the banking department shall be separately independent, and the assets of the trust department or the banking department shall not be affected by the bankruptcy of one party.</p>
<h3>Various Banks Organize a Syndicate to Provide Rural Loans</h3>
<p>In order to promote rural revival and increase the production of materials, the Ministry of Finance has decided to gather more than ten powerful banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Y盐业 Bank, and others, with the Central Reserve Bank as the center, to organize a rural revival lending syndicate to concentrate large sums of money for low-interest lending to rural areas. The specific plan is being drafted by the Ministry of Finance. It is understood that rural loans are intended for agricultural tools, plowing cattle, seedlings, farm warehouses, and rural pawnshops, and rural cooperatives are the target of the loans. Farmers' agricultural products such as rice, grains, beans, etc., may be stored in farm warehouses in various places and apply for mortgages from various banks and shops. Rural pawnshops are allowed to accept pledges, with the aim of regulating agricultural finance and reviving and reorganizing rural areas.</p>
<h3>Demand for Temporary Suspension of Active Deposit Reserve from Banking Industry</h3>
<p>In accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various banks and money shops shall, in order to protect the interests of depositors, legally deposit reserve funds with the Central Reserve Bank: (1) Term deposits and special current deposits shall be 5% or more, (2) Current deposits shall be 10% or more. The reserve funds for term deposits and special current deposits have already been fully paid, but it was agreed that 5% of the current deposit reserve would be paid first, and the remaining 5% would be paid by the end of April. It is now learned that the banking and money industries, after a joint meeting, at the request of the member banks and shops, given the current emergency in the money market, have requested that the payment of the 5% current deposit reserve due at the end of April be temporarily suspended for accommodation. It is reported that the banking and money industries have not only sent representatives to contact the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, but have also jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to approve the temporary suspension of payment.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Ten Industry Associations; Businesses Not Joining Associations to be Shut Down from May 1st; Coal Briquette and Cotton Weaving Factory Associations to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>In order to adjust the old industry associations in this city that are not suitable for wartime economic institutions, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau has designated the initiators of ten industry associations, including the Cotton Industry Association, to convene and organize their establishment within a specified period, and ordered all companies and businesses in various industries to register and join as members of the respective industry associations, otherwise they will be shut down from May 1st.</p>
<p>It is learned that the associations that have already complied with the order to reorganize and establish include the Industrial Association, the Oil and Fat Industry Association, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Cloth Shop Association, the Textile Mill Association, the Cotton Industry Association, the Cigarette, Match, Soap and Candle Industry Association, and the Tobacco Industry Association, a total of seven industry associations, which have successively convened founding congresses and processed the registration of members of the industry associations. The Coal Shop Industry Association is scheduled to convene its founding congress on May 1st. The Coal Briquette Industry Association and the Cotton Weaving Factory Industry Association will convene their founding congresses in the near future. It is reported that companies and businesses in the above ten industry associations that are found not to have joined the association as members after the following day (May 1st) will be ordered to shut down.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Withdraws the General Rules for the Organization of Joint Operating Societies</h3>
<p>In order to actively control food throughout the country to suit wartime food policies, the Ministry of Food had promulgated the General Rules for the Organization of Food Joint Operating Societies. The rice industry in this city is currently preparing to organize one. It is now learned that the Ministry of Food believes that the previously promulgated General Rules for the Organization of Food Joint Operating Societies were not thorough and are not applicable. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to withdraw them. In addition, the organizational rules for city and county joint operating societies will also be revised and then announced again. The Municipal Food Bureau has already received instructions from the Ministry and immediately informed the Shanghai Rice Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Issues a Circular to Investigate Food Industry Associations</h3>
<p>In order to implement wartime food policies, the Ministry of Food has issued a circular to food bureaus in various regions, ordering them to investigate the various industry associations engaged in the food industry in their respective regions, as well as their original departments and the types of food they operate in, and to report in detail for verification, so as to make the food institutions in various regions more substantial and the supply of food for the people more stable.</p>

<h3>Special Silk Donations Showing Improvement</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control, our country's control institutions have been unified. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement promulgated by the government, materials in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing that are outside the scope of the prohibition can be freely moved! Due to the convenience and smoothness of material transportation, the tax revenues of various tax authorities have increased compared to the past. It is reported that silk is not included in the controlled materials, and raw silk and silkworm cocoons in the interior can also be freely traded. Therefore, the tax revenue of the Silk Construction Special Donation Office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area, which is under the Ministry of Finance, is showing improvement.</p>

<h3>Translated Commentary: The Current Problems of Financial Control</h3>
<p>In order to establish China's controlled economy, it is necessary to first establish the fundamental problem of financial control. The crux of various economic problems in Central China can be traced back to the incomplete implementation of financial control. Everyone believes that if financial control can be completed, most of the various problems currently faced can be resolved.</p>
<p>The three key tasks of financial control are: (1) Reorganizing and merging small banks (2) Reorganizing silver houses and money shops (3) Strengthening the control power of the Central Reserve Bank. If the above problems can be resolved reasonably, then the current phenomena of hoarding, high prices, and sluggish production can be reduced by half, and the economy of Central China can be more normal. If we want to treat the root cause rather than the symptoms, then the National Government should focus on completing financial control.</p>
<p>However, it must be known that these problems, at first glance, seem simple, but are actually difficult to say and even more difficult to do. For example, the existence of small banks is actually due to the various social conditions that allow them to exist. Even if they are merged using mechanical means, the actual effect of the merger cannot be achieved. Because the problem is so difficult, the authorities must deploy capable personnel to deal with it effectively when implementing the reorganization and merger of financial institutions.</p>
<p>Reorganizing silver houses and money shops is now absolutely necessary and is a problem that the public hopes to resolve. Since the Greater East Asia War, the business of general money shops has almost lost its proper scope. Especially after the military halted the issuance of new banknotes, they have completely lost their reason for existence. Therefore, they are all looking for a way out in hoarding, and together with the silver houses, they are the cancer of the Central China economy. Therefore, no one will object to the reorganization of silver houses and money shops. However, in this regard, consideration should also be given to changing industries and other issues. In short, this cancer will harm one day if it is not removed one day. I hope that the authorities will think deeply about it.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of financial control is that we earnestly hope that the National Government authorities will strengthen the control power of the Central Reserve Bank. If the Reserve Bank can complete its natural tasks within its authority, then the financial world of today will be completely renewed. It is hoped that the National Government authorities and the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank will give more consideration to this matter, so as to achieve the perfect completion of financial control.

<h3>How We Can Know People</h3>
<p>— He Xu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It's not so scary to be illiterate, but it's terrifying not to know people." This saying indeed holds some truth.</p>
<p>Often, after reading or hearing a "writer's" patriotic essay or an orator's impassioned speech, we almost worship them, falling to our knees in admiration, even shouting "Long live!" After reading a touching novel, it's also common for young women to secretly develop a one-sided infatuation with the author. However, once we meet them or spend some time with them, we realize they are ordinary people, as the saying goes, "A hero becomes an ordinary person upon seeing him daily." This leads us to believe that "the human heart is unfathomable."</p>
<p>Is it really true that "the human heart is unfathomable?" No. The reason people say this is because they have a problem with their understanding of "people," or they lack some understanding in certain areas.</p>
<p>We believe that humans are part of the universe and members of the animal kingdom. Although humans are said to be "the most intelligent of all creatures," they still retain the habits and nature of animals. Therefore, when you analyze a person's life, never forget that they are a "person" (even "sages" are). Then it becomes easier to understand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people grow up in society, and their thoughts, habits, behaviors, and preferences are all subject to the rules and consciousness of the society in which they live. Therefore, to understand a person, we cannot simply assess their strengths and weaknesses from head to toe, treating them as an isolated entity. It is extremely inaccurate to weigh their importance in this way. We must strip them bare and observe how they exist in today's society.</p>
<p>Some people who usually consider someone a world-class hero are surprised to hear their wife, secretary, or tea boy say that he is a gluttonous king or a lazy idler. Those who are usually displeased with him then use this as a weapon to attack him, adding fuel to the fire by announcing his ten major crimes. All of this is often used as a weight on the scale when evaluating "people" today. Is this fair? No. It is extremely wrong to abstractly refer to him as a "superman" on ordinary days and then emphasize and exaggerate his private life, ignoring the fact that he also possesses "human" nature and failing to weigh his contributions and merits to society. Isn't it true that he is also made of flesh and blood? Shouldn't he be allowed to have all the material desires of a "person"?</p>
<p>For example, thrift and endurance are our "golden rules" in private life. We often sympathize with and admire someone's plain clothes, simple food, shaved head, walking twenty miles every day (without taking a rickshaw), and reading for six hours without watching Xun Huisheng's performances. However, we overlook the social implications of these actions. His "praiseworthy actions" of frugality are actually for the purpose of accumulating private wealth, making him a complete miser. There are many people in the world who use thrift and endurance to seek fame and reputation. They often use these minor details to gain sympathy from others, wanting people to forget the crimes they have committed in society. These originally good "praiseworthy actions" have instead become tools for evildoers and a disguise for deception. We often see people who have amassed tens of millions of dollars and killed countless civilians (like Sun Chuanfang) then put on old cloth robes, hold prayer beads, chant "Amitabha," and pretend to be devout Buddhists. Can this be used as a weight on the scale?</p>
<p>There are also some people who have made great contributions in politics or literature, and they always act for the public good. Although they may not be very strict in their private lives, having several girlfriends or going to the movies often, can this completely negate their contributions and label them as unpardonable lecherous villains?</p>
<p>Although we do not deny that private life can affect public life, especially in terms of personal development, we should value private life. Extravagance easily leads to corruption, and laziness easily leads to decadence… However, we always value the evaluation of public life more than private life—considering public life as the primary weight in evaluating a person's worth.</p>
<h3>About "Selflessness"</h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>"To eliminate troubles, one must be without self," this is the first line of a couplet by Mr. Yu Quyuan that I saw in a friend's study. Recently, I also happened to read a short "filler" article—"Selflessness"—in this publication, which stirred something within me and made me want to say a few words.</p>
<p>"To eliminate troubles, one must be without self" and "selflessness" are essentially the same, only differing in wording. While it embodies a spirit of great courage, forgetting the small self to serve the greater good, it also carries a certain degree of negativity, defensiveness, and decadence. Sometimes, if it continues to develop in this way, it is very possible to "see through the world" and "enter the Buddhist gate."</p>
<p>Of course, the achievements of many great figures in the world are undoubtedly due to "selflessness," but here we overlook another aspect—while the great figures' selflessness for the public good is a good example, the creator of this model is ultimately the "small self" that plays the most fundamental role. Without this "self," the world's "selfishness and self-interest" might be greatly reduced, but the "self" that works diligently is the original driving force for creating everything that cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p>Therefore, while "selflessness" and "forgetting oneself" are a spirit that humanity needs, "being without self" in order to "eliminate troubles" is ultimately too extreme. However, the content of the spirit of great impartiality and selflessness in "selflessness" is a superior aspect that can be retained, but the essential basic spirit is still to start with the "self."</p>
<p>At the same time, let me further clarify that the proactiveness of "having self" and the great spirit of "selflessness" are the essential basic elements for both to be possessed in a creative career. And there is no conflict between the two, although they appear to be contradictory, they must be unified to have hope of success.</p>
<p>We must eliminate the negative elements in "selflessness" and allow the proactiveness that starts with the self to fill its deficiencies.</p>
<h3>Valuable Experience</h3>
<p>— Jia Xue</p>
<p>Before leaving the school gates, a person often believes that he already knows a lot and can cope with any difficult situation: or he believes that he can solve problems with courage and enthusiasm without much effort. When he comes into contact with the real society, the whole situation is very different from what he had imagined and described. So he collects his regrets, uses another new method to deal with society, and uses another new knowledge to solve the problems. After many years of this, he becomes familiar with the reality of society, feels the value of experience, and the knowledge he learned in books in the past also becomes useful again. He does not completely lose confidence as he did at the beginning, and he realizes that knowledge and experience can eventually be connected.</p>
<p>A person who has lived in the real situation of society since childhood, of course, accepts very little knowledge from books, but what he learns is practical and useful skills. After many years of this, he is already very skilled in his own industry, his experience is hidden in properly dealing with things and calmly dealing with problems, but he does not need to reflect, and it is not easy to think about how the experience came about, because his experience is knowledge.</p>
<p>Both of these two types of people benefit from experience, but the former is conscious and the latter is unconscious, and the value of experience is an undeniable fact. When it comes to how to develop after gaining experience, the latter is more likely to maintain the status quo and become stubborn, while further progress and creation often belong to the former.</p>
<h3>An Old Fisherman Talks About Fish Nets</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhong</p>
<p>I met a familiar fisherman by a small stream—a kind old man with twinkling eyes, a red nose, and a few silver strands of beard fluttering on his chin, with faded blue cloth clothes wrapping his solid body.</p>
<p>I sat next to him on a blue stone. I saw him skillfully casting the fishing net with his strong hands, causing ripples on the water's surface.</p>
<p>"Your net," I said, "seems to be very dense, and the ropes are very strong, right?" I felt that my question was too naive and too boring.</p>
<p>"Yes!" the fisherman replied earnestly, a smile appearing on his face. "The fishing net must be like this! If the net is dense, small fish won't leak out." He paused for a moment and continued, "But if it's only dense and not strong, when a big fish gets caught, because the fish is strong and powerful, after struggling for a while, it may break out of the net, and those small fish, needless to say, will also slip away behind it…"</p>
<p>"That's right, absolutely…"</p>
<p>"Young friend!" the fisherman said to me in a gentle and deep tone, his attitude appearing very sincere, "Don't dismiss what I said about the fishing net, thinking it's too ordinary and unremarkable. You must know that when we handle any events, big or small, we must be precise and decisive. You are still young…"</p>
<p>I listened intently, nodding in understanding.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Watching "'For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?'"</h3>
<p>— Kui Yi</p>
<p>In order to make money, the content of the scripts is confined to a narrow circle of love affairs to cater to the tastes of the audience. The slogan "Educate through entertainment" is shouted loudly, but what about the reality? The number of films produced by China Film Union in the past year is not small, right? But as far as I know, there are only three so-called educational films: "Universal Love," "Mother," and the recent "For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?"</p>
<p>The China Film Union authorities are indeed clever. Knowing that educational films do not sell well, they have to insert some "gimmicks" into this educational film "For Whom Are You Toiling and Laboring?" They added a few scenes of Bai Guang singing big drum ballads.</p>
<p>There are some things worth discussing, such as: Mei Xi, feeling Bai Guang's charm, gets entangled with her and does not go to the company to work for several days, but he would not be so extreme as to forget his own son (who is only about ten years old), whom he lives with day and night, and disregard his son's life. Furthermore, it is too unreasonable for Mei Xi, such a righteous gentleman, to change so quickly. For example, it is too coincidental that Mei Xi met the manager Xu Xinyuan at Bai Guang's house. At that time, Bai Guang's sudden change of attitude towards Mei Xi, which had been admired in the past, was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>The director also does not pay much attention to small details, such as: Da Chuan, played by Mei Xi, is only in his thirties or forties, while the遺像 of his wife looks like she is in her fifties or sixties. Also, Ji Chuan—Da Chuan's son—was drenched in the rain, and of course his face was covered with rainwater, but when Mei Xi saw him, he asked, "Are you crying?" How could he tell that there were tears in addition to the rainwater on his face?</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the atmosphere of sorrow, Ji Chuan was made to encounter a heavy thunderstorm after school. Instead of hurrying home, he stood there in the torrential rain, lost in thought, and then Da Chuan waited impatiently and went out with an umbrella to find his son in the rain. When the two met, Ji Chuan had to tell his father that he did not want to study and wanted to find a job, regardless of being drenched in the rain, which seems a bit forced.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether the director is successful or not, this film can be said to be an "educational film" and is worth watching, especially for those who are children. After watching it, they will be very moved!</p>
<h3>Think About It</h3>
<p>— Yi Wei</p>
<p>If one can think carefully before doing something, while doing something, and after doing something, then one can enrich experience, be thorough in observation, and have reasonable, quick, and systematic thoughts. When encountering such a thing for the second time in the future, one can increase much smoothness and convenience.</p>
<p>Many people never bother to think about something before doing it, while doing it, or after doing it; therefore, many of the things they do can be used as material for sighing.</p>
<p>Some people are very willing to use their brains. Every time they do something, they first think about whether I should do it, whether I have the ability to do it, what effect it will have, and what impact it will have on various aspects of reputation, personality, and body. If, after considering it, it is indeed beneficial or should be done, then they make a decision to implement it and never hesitate. If the advantages and disadvantages are half and half, and it can be done or not, then they still do not do it; because the same time spent doing this thing can be transferred to other more beneficial work. If it is not beneficial, of course, they restrain themselves and decide not to do it, no matter how great the threat is.</p>
<p>When the research result is that it is necessary to do it, when implementing it, they must add another consideration, putting many methods together, comparing them, and thinking about which step to take to get twice the result with half the effort and have no risk of failure.</p>
<p>Human history is full of the tragedies caused by the recklessness and carelessness of those who have not developed the habit of thinking. If everyone had the habit of thinking, I dare to believe that not only the loss of life and the failure of careers can be greatly reduced, but also people's character and morality can be greatly improved.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must strive to develop the habit of "thinking," so that every thing is considered. This is our urgent task at present.</p>

<h3>Orphan Education Should Have a Comprehensive Plan</h3>
<p>— Lin Chongzhi</p>
<p>There should be various improvements in the education, production, and future prospects of children to solve the difficulties in the work of relief organizations. The methods are: (1) Overall planning, that is, completely changing the mixed education method of orphans to various different education methods that are comprehensive or separate according to the children's age, gender, and intelligence. If the children are of excellent temperament, they should be sent to public or private middle schools or universities, and the required expenses will be allocated by the fund on a regular basis. At the same time, the schools will be requested to provide free education so that they can receive a complete education. If the children are of rough temperament and are indeed incapable of further education, then experimental factories or farms should be set up to provide them with technical training so that they can become independent after mastering a skill. (2) Thorough investigation. A thorough investigation should be conducted on the existing orphans, such as the economic conditions, environmental equipment, and management of the organization, which must be completely clear to serve as the basis for adjustment. If the environmental equipment of a certain organization really does not meet the educational conditions, it will only be asked to stop operating and merge its financial and human resources with a better organization. On the contrary, if the environmental equipment of a certain organization is indeed suitable for the education of a certain type of children, even if the economy or equipment is insufficient, then the expenses for enriching it will be provided, and then its responsibility will be increased. If there is no suitable organization to place a certain type of children, an independent hospital should be set up separately to meet certain needs. At the same time, a "Orphan Fund" should be established in the society to be responsible for raising funds for various organizations and allocating or assisting them according to the budget of each organization. (3) The implementation method should be simple and effective. You may wish to ask the Shen Bao authorities to be responsible for launching and organizing the "Orphan Welfare Committee," hiring seven to nine members, who are subordinate to the Social Service Department of the newspaper, to be responsible for all progress matters. At the same time, organize the "Orphan Fund" to be responsible for the fundraising, distribution, and management of the educational nature of orphans. At the same time, a special request is made to the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau to provide necessary assistance for future adjustment work, so as to reduce the difficult work of orphan education at present.</p>
<h3>Song of a Poor Scholar</h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>In old age, I encountered war and chaos, and returned to live in seclusion, hiding my shadow. The vicissitudes of life are like dust dreams, and my life is like the ashes of a calamity. I have no share of the land outside the city, and my skills of hoarding are even more lacking. I cry with my wife in a cowhide coat, and the flies profit is cut off from my children's clothes. I patch up the broken house with vines, and bask the worn-out fur coat in the sun. My destiny is trapped in Capricorn, and I am like a dried-up fish in a dry rut. I can enjoy poverty in a humble alley, and I can still be relaxed on a poor road. I read by the fire of the screen window at the third watch, and I have hundreds of cities' worth of books in my horse tent. The mansions have become solid fortresses, and the high-rise buildings are all ruins. I listen to the Tartar flute all night long, and I look at the war chariots in military uniform. My proud bones are still as before, and my heroic ambitions have lost their beginnings. I am moved by the tears of the flowers and birds, and I am bitter to part with the emptiness of friends. I have experienced the hardships of the world, and I have eliminated the illusion of Zen. I indulge in tea leaves with a broad mind, and I fill my stomach with the joy of garden vegetables. It is difficult to harmonize with the customs in my old age, and the millet dream has already matured. I spend my years in leisure吟, and what else can I do but this?</p>
<p>(Note) Life in Shanghai is extremely difficult. If one cannot engage in commerce and hoarding, or if one's family is not wealthy, it is simply difficult to support oneself. Therefore, most poor scholars are forced to return to their hometowns. The above poem reflects the recent situation of poor scholars. If domestic scholars are willing to bestow harmonious chapters, it would be even more fortunate. Also, poor scholars often suffer from lung diseases due to malnutrition. If you have any doubts or questions about prolonged coughs and bloody sputum, please send a sincere letter for a reply, and I will do my duty. Contact address: Mr. Yang, Youzhu Medical Society, Shanghai Sacred Heart Hospital Road (at the intersection of Route Pu Shi).</p>
<h3>Dr. Liu Offers Preferential Treatment to Teachers</h3>
<p>Dr. Liu Yongjun is enthusiastic about serving the society. Yesterday, he sent 50 free treatment certificates and 100 half-price preferential certificates to our publication, to be used by poor teachers, students, and the sick. In view of the fact that nine out of ten people suffer from red eye, the doctor has sincerely prepared a special medicine for red eye, charging only the cost price and giving it away to the poor and sick. However, the distribution is limited to the second clinic, located on the second floor of Zhengwei Pharmacy at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Route Cardinal Mercier, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm.</p>
<p>Calligraphy to Help the Poor The famous calligrapher and painter Mr. Zeng Gongye, an old man of seventy-five, is happy to do good. He is now scheduled to offer a 40% discount on calligraphy and painting commissions in May, and donate half of the proceeds to the newspaper's fund for helping the poor. It will end after a full month. Contact Mr. Ling of the business department of this publication.</p>
