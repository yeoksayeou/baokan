<h3 id="c1">圖書出版問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>圖書出版問題，爲一國文化事業中的重要問題，現代强國，文化都極發達，圖書出版，雖在戰時，縱有减少，但坊間新出圖書，決不致全部停滯。可是自前年年底大東亞戰爭爆發以還，和平區內的圖書出版事業，幾乎陷於全部停滯的狀態。所以，一年來小學，中學，大學以至專科的課本，都是鬧恐慌。「讀書無書」，幾乎是和平區內最普遍的現象，至於學校補充讀物，國民一般讀物，所謂人民精神食糧，同樣的有饑餓之嘆。</p>
<p>一般無力入學而有志於自修的靑年，得不到良好的圖書。更嚴重的是專門性的論著，科學圖書和參考書，工具書如年鑑，字典，辭書，地圖，調查統計刊物等，更已完全絕跡於出版界，使有志於爲國盡瘁的專家學者，有英雄無用武之地的感嘆。圖書出版問題之影響於國家前途爲如何嚴重，已不言而喻了。</p>
<p>年來圖書出版之停滯，據我們粗淺的覜察：第一由於政洽方面者，國府還都以來，政府忙於黨政外交諸端，對於文化出版，尙未　出其全力；民營各書局以政府對於圖書出版，尙無確定方針，於是雖知文化之重要，亦只有束手觀變。第二由於經濟方面者，紙張，印刷工具及一切開支，飛躍騰漲，而圖書定價非同一般日用品，可以日增夜漲，於是出版家更不敢冒險從事。而流行於市上者，除極少數眞誠爲文化奮鬥者外，大都是些神怪色情，和一切粗製濫造，徒足以降低國民文化的出版物。此外如運銷上的困難，著作上的諱忌，當然也是重要的原因。然而無論如何，我們檢討過去一年來圖書出版停滯的不良現象，深覺政府當局不能不負資任。</p>
<p>可是，我們絕對同情當局的苦衷，問題只在今後如何？在這裏我們却不能不希望當局鑒於圖書出版問題的嚴重，從速改善一切出版條件，明定圖書雜誌編輯與檢查方針，切實保障與扶助正當的出版事業。同時我們希望出版界方面，尤其是各大書局認淸本身對於國家民族的重大責任，繼續努力於出版事業，消減精神食糧恐慌的現象。我們敢於在今日大聲疾呼：圖書出版問題，若不迅謀合理解決，對內則國民無書可讀，爲國家民族莫大的損失；對外則一國文化事業停滯，甚至停止出版，尤爲國家莫大的恥辱。這是政府當局和出版界同應深切反省的。</p>

<h3 id="c2">所望於內閣顧問制者 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>根據現實，使戰時經濟的運營富有彈力性，故採取民間最高首腦的意見，以期政府與民間的積極合作，這確是很正當的。東條首相把日本一億民衆的旺盛的總力，這樣地結集起來了。</p>
<p>廢止現在事實上已不運用的內閣參議制度，而創設內閣顧問制度，在政治上說來，具有加强內閣的意義。同時，戰時行政特例法，戰時行政職權特例等的企劃運營，「擢拔產業經濟界的名流重鎭，使爲總理大臣的顧問」，一切政務的施行，將以事業界的實情爲依據。</p>
<p>政治是人造成的，而人的價値決定於行動。被舉爲內閣顧問的諸君，都是不愧爲名流重鎮之士。內閣顧問的人選，與其事業及職務無關係，而唯其個人的才能是視。目前的戰局，愈加顯呈其深刻的態勢，昨日之比今日，今日之比明日，戰力必須有日新月異的增加。吾人對於內閣制度運用之圓滑及前進，不禁翹首以盼。</p>
<p>以內閣顧問與有關係的國務大臣爲會員，設置戰時經濟協議會，使爲總理大臣的詻詢機關，當然使兩者有更密切的聯繫，戰時行政特例法等法案的主旨，希望使政府機構能够充分發揮其能率，戰時經濟協議會向這一卞向的努力，吾人實寄與很大的期待。</p>
<p>此次議會所主張的一要點，企圖振肅經濟統制關係官吏的紀綱。爲適應這一要求，乃有行政查察制的實施，所以這制度之圓滑的活用，將不僅止於查察，被查察的關係，並將使政府與民間產業，卽在最細小的處所，亦有密切的聯繫。</p>
<p>以上幾種新制度，使官民一體的態勢更加强化，民間對政府將有更深的信賴。立在這基礎之上，使決戰階段下最切要的軍需物資的生產，克服橫亘於其過程上的許多困難，而有飛躍的增產，這是否人最所切望的。（翔：譯自三月十九日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎原著</p>
<p>（一）美國招牌</p>
<p>「枯萎的芒花、像鬼怪的本相」。我們對於盎格魯撒克遜人是抱着这种心情的。盎格魯撒克遜人，百餘年來，成爲日本國民—雖不能說是全體，也可說是大多數，無論貧富，貴賤，智愚，賢不肖所崇拜的對象。所以要擊滅盎格魯撒克遜，非先從日本國內，各人心上根深蒂固的盎格魯撒克遜優越觀的崇拜陋習，掃除凈盡不可。</p>
<p>美國人對於日本人，是抱着友誼的態度也好，抱着敵對的態度也好，總之，在昭和十六年（一九四一年）十二月八日大詔頒發以前，日本國民中大半對於美國表示着好意的，而且認定美國也應該是對日表示着好意的。如果認爲美國對於日本人有所誤解時，那末其誤解也都是善意的誤解。貝利（Perry，Matthew　Calleraith）來威嚇日本，不得已而用大砲來强迫日本，且在日本近海的小笠原島，台灣等處，設立儲煤塲，根據地，攻擊日本。又進而甚至在日本臥榻之旁，計劃設置殖民地。那知日本竟把這個貝利當做開國恩人，特地在久里濱建立貝利登陸紀念的大石碑，而在那個碑面上，不是還刻着日本明治元勳第一政治家伊藤博文公親筆的銘辭嗎？</p>
<p>講到醫生，便是哈蓬博士；講到學者，便是富爾別基先生；講到理想的人物，便是華盛頓，林肯；講到賢者，便是富蘭克林。日本人之這種崇拜美國及美國人的習慣，從明治新知識之士森有禮，金之丞，一直到最近銀座街上沉迷於爵士樂的哥兒們，無不如此的。</p>
<p>美國人當初對於日本，頗表不平。那就是，他們雖然把日本的主要物產像生絲啦，茶葉啦，只管陸續運去，而日本從美國那裏則沒有什麽可觀的購買。像這樣的單面貿易，日本對於美國，不是太對不起嗎？美國公使哈巴特，在陸奧宗光伯出任駐美公使的送別會席上，曾作過那樣的演說。</p>
<p>然而在日本方面，却作了這樣多餘的分辯：不錯，日本向着美國，固然是多賣而少購，可是向着英國，却是少賣而多購；不過美國向着英國，也是多賣而少購的，所以把日美英三國的貿易來作通算，那末不是可以說美國所失於日本的，可以得之於英國，而日本所失於英國的，可以得之於美國嗎？</p>
<p>可是後來形勢一變，凡是日本所必需的物資，差不多一切都要仰給於美國，因此，美國便以爲只要扣留他們的物資，日本就不問可否，完全聽從美國意思；這種想法，在美國那樣以物資爲萬能的國家，更不足奇。而且事實是如此的，美國只要扣留棉花，扣留煤汕，甚至扣留廢鐵，取消通商條約，凍結黃金則日本就要感到爲難；然而因爲感到爲難，就會屈身低頭，這個結論則是錯誤了。日本正因爲感到爲難，所以反抗了；因爲感到爲難，所以蹶然而起了；因爲感到爲難，所以終於爲自衛而頒發了宣戰的大詔。</p>
<p>日本曾經是怎樣醉心於盎格魯撒克雙組元推進劑文明的呢？這在今日想來，到底有點難以置信。像那個後來做了日本的文部大臣而成爲日本主義敎育之先輩的森有禮子爵，他在明治初期，也說日本的文詞不合文法，畢竟不能用以陳述完全正確的意義，因此把其所著的「日本敎育論」一書，用英文來寫成。馬塲辰猪氏對肚大爲憤慨，故而作了一本「日本文法論」，而證明日本也有完美的文法，並闡明用日本文，無論什么事情，沒有不能表明的。可是出乎意料的，那本馬塲氏的「日本文法論」，原來也是用英文寫成的。筆者還記得明治十五年之夏，會見馬塲氏時，由馬塲氏親自送了那本小册給我。</p>
<p>然而抱着和森子爵同樣之感的，在明治初期以後的知識階級中，實在不在少數。明治十八九年至二十四五年間，日本之歐化熱，達到了它的極度。不過雖說是歐化熱，實在乃是所娛樂英美化熱，所以像重要的文書等，一定先要用英文起稿，再來譯成日本文。這類事情，筆者屢屢目擊，而且還可以舉出一個實例來。那就是，明治三十三年，伊藤公創立政友會時，據說其綱領是出自朝比奈知良氏手筆的，然而於府縣會選舉議員之際，亦可稱爲政友會第二鋼領的那篇伊藤公吿黨員書，則是先使都　馨六男爵由英文起草，而後囑筆者把其譯成日本文的。所以這不能說是輕視日本文嗎？不能說是尊重英文嗎？總之，其重視英文有如此者。</p>
<p>那種狀態，和昔之漢學者一到品川就以爲已一脚踏近了中國而喜者，完全一樣，所以不管是什么，只要是英美的，貓也好，狗也好，無不歡迎。</p>
<p>因此，甚至把美國向着日本表示惡意的事，也完全諒解爲好意。例如美國對於日本僑民的學童，以差別待遇而排斥之。又如對於日本的移民，不但拒絕其入國，而且對於已入其國者，定出種種苛刻而不公平的法律，雖未至於驅逐，而虐待備至。諸如此類的惡意表示，日本人之中爲之憤慨者，固屬不鮮，然而還說中國人比日本人更受虐待，或是說日本人所以受到這種虐待，是因爲太不知順應環境之故，實是自招之禍。像這種連美國人也恥於說出口來的話，日本人之中只是恬然而作如想的，已不必說，而恬然說出口來的，也不在少數。</p>
<p>所以當哈利曼提議要包辦那條在日俄戰爭中，差不多是最重要的亦可說是唯一的效果之南滿鐵道時，有着精通內外時務之稱的元老，固不必說，就是像當時的首相桂公，也不加考慮而答應下來，等到小村外相從樸資茅斯歸京後，那件事情已成熟到九分九厘，好容易把它阻止。</p>
<p>日本朝野曾經是怎樣向着美國，不因他們的特地要求，而自動地傾其好意，由上所述，當可知道。所以美國以其大艦隊來向日本威嚇時，日本竟視爲貴客而歡迎之。所謂「嗔拳不打笑面」，難怪羅斯福—不是今日的羅斯福—也覺得爲難，興趣的拳頭無法打下來，這倒不妨說是一件痛快的事。</p>
<p>總之，依照一般日美交涉的歷史，從一方看來，日本對於保持兩車間的和平，曾經是如何忠實而且熱心，其可資證明的資料，足而有餘；然而從他方面看來，日本向着美國做幻夢，以爲自己表示好意，對造亦必同樣向我表示好意，其過早之計，和出於臆斷的痴情，也不能不說是無限的。</p>
<p>在某次的晚餐會席上，筆者會和法國大便克羅迪爾隣座。談次，克氏對我說：</p>
<p>「君作怎樣的感想呢？現在貴國不是舉其善風美俗而拋諸九霄，幾乎完全美國化了嗎？」</p>
<p>這話是多少帶着厭惡的情緒而對我說的。不過克氏的話，恐怕還是一個有趣的問題，察其語意，似乎那溢露於銀座街頭的惡趣味等，使他特別受了刺激。然而睜開眼睛仔細觀察，則日本的美國化，毌寗是日本精神的遺失，和享樂主義的蔓延。即日本的某階級之流，幾乎沒有不掛美國招牌的。</p>
<p>（二）日本是東亞的英國嗎？</p>
<p>抒日本稱爲東亞的英國，這雖然不知是誰稱呼出來的，然而在勻少壯時代，已是一句流行話了。並且那時代的人們，還一定要使日本成爲東亞的英國，因此羨望，奮進，而且努力。換句話說，英國曾經是那樣地給日本當做和一個理想車，當做一個標準國。</p>
<p>如果要舉出日本和英國的類似點來，那末，第一，兩國都是島國，而且其主島的面積，也大同小異，並且都是接近大陸。又，英國是以盎格魯撒克遜人爲主幹而成的混合人種，日本也並非不可稱爲以大和民族爲中樞的混合人種。不過類似之點也只有這幾點而已。在地理上，兩者固然都是島國，但日本是所謂蜻蜓洲，細而長，自西南延至東北；英國則東西南北自成平衡。日本在九州隔平戶，壹岐，對馬的飛石，而與朝鮮半島相接，本島則隔渺茫的日本海而與滿洲—甞爲中國稱爲化外之地者—相接，隔琉球，台灣，而與華南相接，而且便於遣送大兵之處很少。然而英國則隔多維海峽之一衣帶水而與大陸相接，且爲一望平野，並可稱爲英國之中心地帶的倫敦，亦距海岸不遠，若荷蘭海軍攻入英國，則其艦隊可溯泰晤士河至倫敦，以行肉搏。在日本，與大陸直接相摩擦的地方，只有九州或東北之一角，日本本島的要部，則不在於容易受外敵侵襲的位置。</p>
<p>更就人種來說，日本在昔雖有皇別，神別，蕃別的區別，然而到了今日，一切的日本人，都像從同一模型似的了。凡是生物學的，科學的，精神的，心靈的，各種性質都已融合着，不管是九州人，是東北人，只要是居住於大八州的，都是道地的日本國民。</p>
<p>然而在英國，雖同樣稱爲是英國，而蘇格蘭則民情，風俗，習慣，宗敎，都維持其特色。又如佔據本島一角之渺小的威爾士，其人種亦是凱爾脫種，言語也還是通用着威爾士語。像那個魯意佐治（Lloyd　　George），還以威爾士人自誇哩。至於隔着愛爾蘭海峽的愛爾蘭，除了極少數的新敎徒及由英本車移來居住的遙領地主外，人種槪屬於凱爾特人，宗敎不必說，就是在思想上，也完全是獨立的，今日甚至連國號也改爲愛爾（Eire）了。英國雖然硬要反愛爾蘭人則不悄與共，故雖在英國與德意日開戰的現在，他們還是標榜獨立，全然取着毫無關係的立塲。愛爾蘭在英國的位置，比諸九州在日本的位置，猶在其上，然而尚且如此，由此觀之，則雖說同樣是混合人種，英國不過把不同的人種使爲同一，或使其居住於接近之地而已。而且愛爾蘭人，十之八九，是對英國懷着敵意的。</p>
<p>以那樣的狀態，而稱日本爲東亞的英國，毌寗是意外的奉承，使吾人之無從感謝，也於此爲極，至於像那竟自稱爲東亞的英國，希望成爲東亞的英國者，在今日看來，完全是精神失常。</p>

<p>華中棉產改進會，爲改革運營以謀推進業務起見，已決將該會會則加以修正，並取消總裁副總裁制，改爲會長制。這一個改組方案吿訴我們，爲適應當前環境的需要，華中棉花的生產，必須推廣，華中棉產的標準，必須提高</p>
<p>說到棉花生產量與消費量的比較，我們回想到不久以前，華中棉花統制會理事長堤孝氏所說的一句話：「東亞各地每年的棉花消費量，至少爲一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇擔，而華中華北兩個區域的出產量，僅爲六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇擔，即加上朝鮮，台灣，越南，泰國，締甸，的綜合產量一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇擔，亦僅爲七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇。所以生產量尙不及消費量的一半」。</p>
<p>由此看來，棉花的增產，是積極需要的，而華中棉花的增產，尤其是積極需要的，因爲華中，在氣候與地理上，對於改進棉產，特別可以供給更多的機會，更好的環境。其次，華中人烟比較稠密，需要比較殷繁；即以消費而論，亦常做到供應相求，方爲合理。此外，華中以上海爲其輪軸，已成爲當前物資交流的總滙，得以其剩餘的棉產，供給大東亞共榮圈以內的各區域，藉以調劑其盈虛，亦爲華中棉產應常積極推廣與改進的一個重要理由。</p>
<p>憶自民初以至最近的過去，我國對於植棉改進事業，亦曾有過好幾種的組織，好幾决的推進；可惜因爲種種闢係，都不過成爲中國植棉事業史上的一亘陳跡。此次華中棉產改進會的改組，與共會則的修正，一些可以把已往的種種陳跡，變爲未來的種種成績。</p>
<h3 id="c39">滬財政界人士談　現階段中國財政狀況 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊　據滬市財政界人士談稱：中國政府財政狀况，現不僅以平衡收支爲目標，而以增加生產撙節消耗與改進民生爲唯一要務。同時對於稅收機關，亦須調整，全國各種稅則均將使其簡單化統一化，幣制之改善，刻正順利進行，民生得吿穩定，工商業得吿恢復，國庫收入，然後可以增加，而預算表亦得平衡。各地及本埠當局之收稅，巳均有相當之自主與獨立，俾各地當局之支出不致完全仰賴於中央政府，按當地當局，對於公家支出，已根據通常收入，採取審愼之政策，以平衡預算，此後國庫，當有餘裕，而間接使國稅减少，人民負担减輕，政府收入，以關稅鹽稅及統稅爲主要。關稅自上年一月以來，已稍有增高，其附加稅爲百分之一百，華南華中各關署，均已决第恢復。查國府還都前，關稅總收入爲二千至三千萬萬元，以後外商運輸停頓，關稅驟减，去年二月减至六百萬元，其附加稅則亦爲六百萬元，迄同年三月進出口稅，始達九百萬元。附加稅七百萬元，較之大東亞戰前，進出口稅减去三分之二，附加稅則有增加，迄去年年底，關稅因辦理完善而得劇增。關稅之外，其次爲鹽稅，國府還都後，即着手計劃恢復戰區內之鹽斤產量，結果自二·八〇〇·〇〇〇担（一九四〇年以海州區爲限）增至四·九〇〇·〇〇〇担以上，（一九四一年）及四·七一〇·〇〇〇担以上，（一九四二年一月至八月）。由是以後，鑒塲有多數已經相繼恢復，在山東及江蘇兩省者，恢復最速，於是鹽稅驟增許多。在一九四二年一月至八月期間，鹽稅突自一二·八〇〇〇元（一九四〇年）飛增至四五·〇〇）〇·〇〇〇元以上、統稅雖位居第三，然亦爲國稅收入之个大來源，政府已盡最大努力，改善各統稅局之行政，使收稅手續，漸趨簡單化而合理化。一九四一年十月公布棉花及棉紗微收統稅章則，翌年四月，實行捲烟統稅率，同年六月公布麵粉統稅率，其時物價繼長增高，統稅屢經修訂，以期適合現實，其主要對象，爲奢侈品，蓋其宗旨爲减輕民衆負擔。同時增裕稅收，自一九四二年四月起，捲烟特我，改爲按値抽微，棉花棉紗及疋頭，亦按値徵百分之五，最近關務署之移交國府，蘇浙皖統稅局之改組，與其他措置，足使稅收機構，更臻健全，且自中國　　以還，整個民族經濟機構，　逐漸立於戰時基礎。此次全國商業統制總會之成立，及中國著名銀行及財政家之參加，足使全國繁榮，頓復舊規，此外自四月一日起，停發軍用票，亦爲　　穩定中儲券之積極方法，而爲一般經濟狀况進一步改善之先驅云云。</p>

<p>— 兼之</p>
<p>但事實尙不若此之簡單，如以銀行存款之性質加以分析，則其情形之悲觀，更有非意想所及者。查銀行定期存款，乃民間眞正之儲蓄，爲銀行資力命脈之結晶，至活期存款，不過爲一種流動通貨，其性質與紙幣實無大異。十一家商業銀行在上海之定期存款，在事變前占總存款百分之六十，活期存款占百分之四十。今則定期存款僅占百分之二十，活期存款竟占百分之八十。換言之，商業銀行已不復爲民間儲蓄之信託人，而僅爲社會通貨之代管者。再進而言之，則人民已將大部儲蓄，自行運用，直接參加投資或投機：如近年來商品及證券市塲活躍之份子，包括老少婦女，三敎九流，即爲明證。銀行不復爲現代社會投資之機構，其影響經濟能力之低薄，於此可見。</p>
<p>商業銀行在此情况下，對於代管之流動通貨——活期存款，——以其增减之無定，迅速如閃電，亦至感運用之困難，更不得不厚集準備，以防萬一，致信用收縮。上海十一家商業銀行準備，二十五年占存款百分之三十一，二十六年僅占百分之二十六，逐漸增至百分之四十六七，至三十一年始稍减。此種銀行之自衛政策，自使利率高翔，足以减少國積，有利於抑低物價政策之推進</p>

<h3 id="e1">Book Publishing Problems <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The issue of book publishing is a crucial aspect of a nation's cultural undertaking. Modern, powerful nations all boast highly developed cultures, and even during wartime, while book publishing may decline, new books do not come to a complete standstill. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War at the end of the year before last, book publishing within the peace zones has almost ground to a complete halt. As a result, textbooks for elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as vocational colleges, have been in short supply for the past year. "No books to read" has become a pervasive problem in the peace zones. Supplementary reading materials for schools and general reading materials for the public, the so-called "spiritual food" for the people, are similarly lacking.</p>
<p>Young people without the means to attend school but with a desire to study on their own cannot access good books. More seriously, specialized treatises, scientific books, reference books, and tools such as yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, and survey statistics are completely absent from the publishing scene. This leaves experts and scholars eager to serve the nation feeling that they have nowhere to apply their talents. It goes without saying how severely the problem of book publishing impacts the nation's future.</p>
<p>According to our superficial observations, the stagnation in book publishing over the past year is due to the following reasons: First, politically, since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been occupied with Party affairs, political diplomacy, and has not yet devoted its full effort to cultural publishing. Private bookstores, seeing that the government lacks a clear direction for book publishing, know the importance of culture but can only stand by and wait. Second, economically, the prices of paper, printing tools, and all expenses have skyrocketed. However, book prices cannot be raised daily like everyday goods, so publishers are hesitant to take risks. The books circulating on the market, with the exception of a small number from those sincerely striving for culture, are mostly supernatural, erotic, and poorly made publications that only serve to degrade national culture. In addition, difficulties in distribution and taboos in writing are certainly important reasons. However, regardless of the reasons, reviewing the negative phenomenon of stagnant book publishing over the past year, we deeply believe that the government cannot escape responsibility.</p>
<p>However, we absolutely sympathize with the difficulties of the authorities. The question is what to do in the future? Here, we cannot help but hope that the authorities, recognizing the severity of the book publishing problem, will quickly improve all publishing conditions, clearly define the editing and inspection guidelines for books and magazines, and effectively protect and support legitimate publishing enterprises. At the same time, we hope that the publishing industry, especially the major bookstores, will recognize their significant responsibility to the nation and the people, and continue to work hard on publishing, to alleviate the phenomenon of the spiritual food shortage. We dare to loudly appeal today: If the problem of book publishing is not resolved reasonably and quickly, internally, the people will have no books to read, which is a great loss to the nation; externally, a country's cultural undertaking will stagnate, or even cease publishing, which is a great disgrace to the nation. This is something that the government and the publishing industry should deeply reflect upon together.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e2">What is Expected of the Cabinet Advisor System <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>It is indeed appropriate to adopt the opinions of top private-sector leaders to make the wartime economy more flexible based on reality, in order to achieve active cooperation between the government and the private sector. Prime Minister Tojo has thus gathered the vigorous overall strength of Japan's 100 million people.</p>
<p>Abolishing the current Cabinet Councillor system, which is de facto no longer in use, and establishing a Cabinet Advisor system has the political significance of strengthening the Cabinet. At the same time, the planning and operation of the Wartime Administrative Exceptions Law, the Wartime Administrative Authority Exceptions Law, etc., involve "recruiting leading figures from the industrial and economic sectors to serve as advisors to the Prime Minister," and the implementation of all government affairs will be based on the actual situation in the business world.</p>
<p>Politics are made by people, and the value of people is determined by action. The gentlemen who have been selected as Cabinet Advisors are all worthy of being called leading figures. The selection of Cabinet Advisors is unrelated to their businesses and positions, and only their personal talents are considered. The current war situation is becoming increasingly profound. Compared to yesterday, today, and compared to today, tomorrow, combat power must increase day by day. We cannot help but look forward to the smooth and forward-looking operation of the Cabinet system.</p>
<p>Establishing a Wartime Economic Council with Cabinet Advisors and relevant state ministers as members to serve as an advisory body to the Prime Minister will naturally create closer ties between the two. The aim of the Wartime Administrative Exceptions Law and other laws is to enable government agencies to fully demonstrate their efficiency. We place great expectations on the efforts of the Wartime Economic Council in this direction.</p>
<p>One of the key points advocated by this parliament is to revitalize the discipline of officials related to economic controls. In order to meet this requirement, an administrative inspection system has been implemented. Therefore, the smooth use of this system will not only be limited to inspection, and the inspected relationship will also create close ties between the government and private industry, even in the smallest places.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned new systems further strengthen the unified state of the government and the people, and the people will have deeper trust in the government. Based on this foundation, making the production of military supplies, which is most essential in the decisive stage of the war, overcome the many difficulties in the process, and achieve a leap in production, is what people most desire.

<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - The implementation terms for the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement were officially signed in Nanjing on the 27th by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. After the signing ceremony, Ambassador Shigemitsu of Japan first delivered a speech, saying: "The terms for your government's implementation of the recovery of the Kulangsu International Settlement have now been signed, which is something that this Ambassador is most pleased about. Based on these terms, the aforementioned settlement, within the scope of Japan's involvement, will be returned to your country on March 30th. This public settlement is also related to several countries besides Japan. I am confident that the other concerned countries will follow Japan's example and take the same steps, so that your government can fully recover the aforementioned settlement in the near future. Since the agreement was concluded on January 9th of this year, the terms for the implementation of the return of Japanese exclusive concessions in seven cities, including Tianjin, were signed on March 14th. On March 22nd, the terms for the recovery of the legation quarters were completed. Today, the terms for the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement have been signed. Japan will return these rights on the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, namely March 30th. The items of the agreement signed on January 9th are being implemented step by step. This is nothing more than an expression of the Japanese government's spirit of overcoming all difficulties and striving to realize its public commitments. At the same time, it is also due to the Japanese government's deep concern for the reconstruction of East Asia and the construction of East Asia, and its heartfelt hope for the independent development of China. I am confident that your country will fully understand this intention."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Reply</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu replied, "Since the agreement was signed on January 9th of this year, your country, with sincere enthusiasm and strong determination, has overcome all difficulties and spared no great sacrifices to implement each and every item of the agreement in a short period of time, striving to carry them out. The terms for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions and the recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters were signed in the middle of this month. Today, we have signed the terms for the recognition of our country's recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement, and all of them are scheduled to be implemented on the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, namely the 30th of this month, which is deeply appreciated by our entire nation. The Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement has been established for 40 years. It is a major economic stronghold for various countries on the southern coast of our country. Our country has wanted to recover it for more than a day, but due to the relatively complex international relations, this long-cherished wish could not be realized. Now, your government has resolutely taken the lead and set an example, promising our country's recovery, so that our many years of wish have been fulfilled at once, which is deeply appreciated. The Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement is also related to several countries besides your country. However, since your country has already taken the lead in returning it, this model will certainly be followed by other related countries. Now that our country has decided to recover the aforementioned settlement, we are confident that other related countries will be able to understand and assist our country's claim in the spirit of friendship, so that our country can fully recover it in the shortest possible time. Your country's return of exclusive concessions and recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters and the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement, its consistent spirit, as you said, expresses the determination to fulfill its promises on the one hand, and assists in our country's independent development on the other. We are not only grateful for this kind of enthusiastic assistance, but we will also strive to strengthen ourselves and promote the spirit of mutual cooperation, and advance towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, it should also be mentioned that since Ambassador Shigemitsu took office, he has made his greatest efforts to assist in the development of our country. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are necessary conditions for our country to complete its independence and autonomy. Now, thanks to your efforts, it is about to be completed, which is a great achievement in the history of our country's revival, and this cannot but be respected."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Talk</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) After the implementation terms for the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement were officially signed by the Chinese and Japanese authorities on the 27th, Foreign Minister Chu of our country made a special statement as follows: "On January 9th of this year, Japan and our country signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Since then, after more than two months, the terms for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions and the recognition of our country's recovery of the legation quarters were signed successively in the middle of this month. Today, the terms for the implementation of the recovery of the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement have been signed. We cannot help but admire the determination and sincerity of the Japanese side in fulfilling its promises. In the past, countries such as Britain and the United States had given lip service to this kind of request from our country, as if expressing deep sympathy. As a result, none of their promises could be completely fulfilled. Therefore, some people could not help but have doubts about the good intentions of the Japanese side. Now, because the Japanese side has actively fulfilled its commitments, this kind of doubt has completely disappeared, and it can prove that the moral spirit of the Japanese side is completely different from the cunning tricks of Britain and the United States. If our country wants to complete its independence and autonomy, it must first eliminate the obstacles to the exercise of territorial rights. Therefore, the recovery of concessions is an urgent task. Since our country has this determination, the Japanese side is willing to do its utmost to assist, so that what has not been realized for several decades has been smoothly progressed today. Now, all the Japanese exclusive concessions have been decided to be returned on the anniversary of the return to the capital. The exclusive concessions of other friendly countries will also be taken over by our country in the near future. What remains are the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement and the Shanghai International Settlement. Regarding the Kulangsu International Settlement, terms have been signed with the Japanese side today. Within the scope of the Japanese side, it will be returned on March 30th. However, in addition to the Japanese side, this settlement is also related to several other countries. Now that Japan has taken the lead in setting an example and has generously returned it, it is firmly believed that other related countries will also be able to understand our determination to recover it and follow Japan's example, so that our country can fully recover it in the shortest possible time. Our country has long cherished the desire to recover concessions, but it has not been realized until now due to the obstruction of Britain and the United States. Now, thanks to the determined assistance of the friendly nation Japan, our country's long-cherished wish has finally been fulfilled. In addition to expressing gratitude, our country should also strive to strengthen and develop itself, so that it has sufficient strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia and completing the Greater East Asia War. This is what all the people of the country should strive for together."</p>
<p>The History of the Establishment of the Settlement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) Kulangsu is a small island in front of Xiamen. Before the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, foreigners already lived there. After the opening of the port, even more foreigners came to live there. In 1901, the British and American consuls submitted a request to the Qing government officials to establish a settlement. The following year (1902), on January 10th, the Qing court and the Xiamen Foreign Consular Corps (consuls from Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) concluded the Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement Regulations, officially recognizing the establishment of the Kulangsu International Settlement. The settlement area was one and a half square miles, and the surrounding waters were white feet at low tide. The administrative organization of the settlement included a council, initially composed of five or six foreigners and one Chinese. Later, at China's request, and with the approval of the Beijing Diplomatic Corps and the Chairman of the Xiamen Consular Corps, the number of Chinese councillors was increased to three in 1926, and to four in 1930.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) After the various units of the Japanese Army in Central China began their spring offensive in the southwest of Wuhan in early February, they continued to attack. By the 18th, they had annihilated the 1233rd Column and the 160th Division of the Chongqing Army's advancing forces, which were entrenched around Bailu Lake. By February 27th, they had further annihilated the Wang Jincai Army. Afterwards, they continued to mop up the triangle area of Hubei. Due to the bravery of the Japanese army and the waning will to resist of the Chongqing Army, the number of surrenders greatly increased. After the Japanese army launched an offensive on February 14th and annihilated three divisions of the Chongqing advancing army in the Bailu Lake area, the war ended on the 18th. Commander Peng Shan had already fled. At the same time, Jin Yiwu, commander of the Third Column of the advancing army and acting commander of the Second War Zone's advancing army, also led his remaining forces north, hiding in the Tianmen and Qianjiang area. Since March 7th, they have dared to repent and surrendered. The Second and Third Columns of the advancing army also surrendered on the 10th and 15th respectively. The encirclement and annihilation of Wang Jincai's forces was also completed by February 27th. Army Commander Wang Jincai and Chief of Staff Li Dexin surrendered on February 25th and March 2nd respectively. By this point, the army had been completely defeated. The only remaining heads of the army are Wang Quanwu, commander of the Independent 4th Brigade, and Xue Zhixuan, commander of the 383rd Brigade, whose whereabouts are unknown. The list of generals under Wang Jincai who surrendered is as follows: Lieutenant General Wang Jincai, Major General Li Dexin, Chief of Staff and Commander of the Independent 6th Brigade, Major General Pan Shangwu, Commander of the Independent 1st Brigade, Major General Su Jinghua, Commander of the Independent 2nd Brigade, Major General Zhang Pinghai, Commander of the Independent 3rd Brigade, Major General Su Zhendong, Commander of the Independent 5th Brigade, Major General Qian Lanpu, Commander of the 382nd Brigade, Major General Zhao Wenshi, Commander of the 384th Brigade.

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Information Spokesperson Condemns Britain and America <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Information Department Spokesperson Horiuchi today strongly condemned the insatiable greed and selfishness of Britain and the United States. He recalled that ten years ago today, Japan resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations, at which time Britain and the United States strongly advocated maintaining the "status quo" in order to maintain their exclusive, comfortable lives. Horiuchi continued that the League of Nations was merely a machine for implementing extractive policies, and Japan was right to be the first to publicly oppose it. Over the past ten years, the world order has moved towards greater justice and equality, which is gratifying. However, the blind and selfish policies of Britain and the United States have plunged the whole world into turmoil, and they have suffered setbacks themselves, but they are still unwilling to wake up. Their stupidity is indeed unparalleled. He also discussed the ambitions of Britain and the United States to expand their control and the infighting between the two sides. The so-called post-war problems are also based on selfishness and self-interest. On the contrary, Japan is working hard to cooperate, restore China's autonomy, and allow Burma's independence, all of which show its sincere heart. Finally, he said that Premier [of Japan]'s prediction of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been realized, and its purpose is lofty and its methods are realistic, which is beyond the Premier's expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Large-Scale Air Battle Over Leningrad; Germans Complete Donets River Sweep <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Eastern Front news, Soviet forces have launched offensives in the area around Leningrad and south of Lake Ladoga in recent days, but they have suffered repeated defeats and their strength has been greatly reduced. On the 26th, there were only small-scale local battles. German fighter-bomber formations remained unusually active and bombed military factories in Leningrad six times on the 26th. The military facilities there were hit and large fires broke out. The Soviet Information Bureau also admitted that the German Air Force had launched a large-scale offensive and engaged in a large-scale air battle with Soviet aircraft. According to German front-line news, the Soviet Air Force's resistance has gradually weakened and seems to have been completely overwhelmed by the German Air Force. In addition, German long-range artillery continued to bombard on the 26th, putting the Soviet army in extremely difficult conditions. The newly built iron bridge on the Dnieper River was completely destroyed, which greatly hindered the Soviet army's transportation lines.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong Press) - The Eastern Front weather has improved and the temperature has risen, but the rivers in the central and northern sectors have not yet thawed. Heavy frost still occurs at night, so Soviet forces attack at night and at dawn. The fighting west of Vyazma is particularly fierce. Fighting continues in the Leningrad and Lake Ladoga areas. The German sweep on the west bank of the Donets River in its upper reaches is almost complete. The Soviet army is still trying to use the bridgehead as a base for attacking Kharkov, but due to insufficient troops, it has failed to stabilize its position. There is no large-scale fighting in the Kuban area, and the Soviet reports are not accurate. Berlin, 27th (Haitong Press) - It was learned today that German forces southeast of Kharkov yesterday swept away the remnants of the Soviet army, driving them back to the Donets River, destroying or capturing 25 Soviet tanks, 40 artillery pieces, and countless light and heavy weapons. German forces northeast of Kursk have made progress in recent days, destroying 21 Soviet tanks. In the Leningrad area, our artillery fiercely bombarded enemy communication lines, inflicting heavy damage.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The True Nature of the Anglo-Saxons (1) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Original Work by Tokutomi Iichirō</p>
<p>(1) The American Signboard</p>
<p>"Withered miscanthus reeds, the true form of a ghost." This is the feeling we have towards the Anglo-Saxons. For over a hundred years, the Anglo-Saxons have become the object of worship for the Japanese people—if not the entire population, then at least the majority, regardless of wealth, status, intelligence, or character. Therefore, to defeat the Anglo-Saxons, we must first completely eradicate the deep-rooted worship of Anglo-Saxon superiority from the hearts of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Whether Americans hold a friendly or hostile attitude towards the Japanese, the majority of Japanese people held goodwill towards the United States before the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript on December 8, 1941 (Showa 16), and believed that the United States should also have goodwill towards Japan. If they thought the United States misunderstood the Japanese, then that misunderstanding was a well-intentioned one. Perry (Matthew Calbraith) came to intimidate Japan, forced Japan with cannons, and established coal storage yards and bases in the Ogasawara Islands and Taiwan near Japan, attacking Japan. Furthermore, they even planned to establish colonies near Japan. Yet, Japan regarded this Perry as the savior who opened the country, and erected a large stone monument commemorating Perry's landing in Kurihama, on which was engraved a inscription personally written by Itō Hirobumi, the first statesman of the Meiji Restoration, wasn't it?</p>
<p>When it came to doctors, it was Dr. Hepburn; when it came to scholars, it was Mr. Verbeck; when it came to ideal figures, it was Washington and Lincoln; when it came to sages, it was Franklin. This habit of the Japanese worshiping the United States and Americans, from the enlightened scholars of the Meiji era like Mori Arinori and Kane Masaakira, to the young men on Ginza Street obsessed with jazz, was universal.</p>
<p>Initially, Americans expressed considerable dissatisfaction with Japan. That was, while they steadily imported Japan's main products like raw silk and tea, Japan did not purchase much from the United States. Wasn't this one-sided trade unfair to the United States? American Minister Hubbard made such a speech at the farewell party for Mutsu Munemitsu when he was appointed as the Japanese Minister to the United States.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side made this superfluous defense: It is true that Japan sells more to the United States than it buys, but it buys more from England than it sells; however, the United States also sells more to England than it buys, so if we consider the trade between Japan, the United States, and England as a whole, can't we say that what the United States loses to Japan can be gained from England, and what Japan loses to England can be gained from the United States?</p>
<p>However, the situation later changed, and Japan had to rely on the United States for almost all of its necessary resources. Therefore, the United States believed that as long as they withheld their resources, Japan would have no choice but to completely obey the United States. This way of thinking is not surprising in a country like the United States, where material resources are considered all-powerful. And the fact is that if the United States withholds cotton, coal, and even scrap iron, cancels trade treaties, and freezes gold, Japan will be in trouble; however, it is wrong to conclude that because Japan is in trouble, it will submit. It was precisely because Japan was in trouble that it resisted; it was because it was in trouble that it rose up; it was because it was in trouble that it finally issued a declaration of war for self-defense.</p>
<p>How infatuated was Japan with Anglo-Saxon civilization? Thinking about it today, it is hard to believe. Viscount Mori Arinori, who later became the Minister of Education and a pioneer of Japanese-ism education, said in the early Meiji era that Japanese writing was grammatically incorrect and could not be used to express completely accurate meanings. Therefore, he wrote his book "On Japanese Education" in English. Mr. Baba Tatsui was greatly indignant and wrote "On Japanese Grammar" to prove that Japanese also has perfect grammar and to explain that anything can be expressed in Japanese. However, unexpectedly, Baba's "On Japanese Grammar" was also written in English. The author remembers meeting Mr. Baba in the summer of Meiji 15 and being personally given that booklet by Mr. Baba.</p>
<p>However, there were many among the intellectual class of the early Meiji era who felt the same as Viscount Mori. From Meiji 18 or 19 to 24 or 25, Japan's craze for Westernization reached its peak. However, although it was called Westernization, it was actually a craze for Anglo-Americanization. Therefore, important documents were always drafted in English first and then translated into Japanese. The author has witnessed this many times and can give a specific example. That is, when Prince Itō founded the Seiyūkai party in Meiji 33, it is said that its platform was written by Asabina Chiryō, but the document issued by Prince Itō to party members during the election of prefectural assembly members, which could also be called the Seiyūkai's second platform, was first drafted in English by Baron Todō Takejirō and then translated into Japanese by the author. Can this not be said to be a contempt for Japanese? Can this not be said to be a respect for English? In short, their emphasis on English was such.</p>
<p>That state was exactly the same as the old Chinese scholars who thought they had set foot in China as soon as they arrived in Shinagawa and rejoiced. Therefore, anything that was Anglo-American, whether it was a cat or a dog, was welcomed.</p>
<p>Therefore, even acts of malice shown by the United States towards Japan were completely understood as acts of goodwill. For example, the United States discriminated against Japanese children in schools. Also, the United States not only refused to allow Japanese immigrants to enter the country, but also enacted various harsh and unfair laws against those who had already entered, not quite to the point of expulsion, but with extreme mistreatment. Although there were not a few Japanese who were indignant at such expressions of malice, there were still those who said that the Chinese were even more mistreated than the Japanese, or that the reason why the Japanese were treated this way was because they were too ignorant of how to adapt to the environment and were actually inviting disaster upon themselves. There were not a few Japanese who not only thought this way without embarrassment, but also said it without embarrassment, words that even Americans would be ashamed to say.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Harriman proposed to take over the South Manchurian Railway, which was almost the most important or even the only effective thing in the Russo-Japanese War, the elder statesmen, who were known to be well-versed in both domestic and foreign affairs, not to mention Prime Minister Katsura, agreed without hesitation. By the time Foreign Minister Komura returned to Tokyo from Portsmouth, the matter had matured to 99%, and it was barely stopped.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen how Japan, both in government and among the people, automatically showed goodwill towards the United States without being specifically asked to do so. Therefore, when the United States used its Great White Fleet to intimidate Japan, Japan actually welcomed them as honored guests. As the saying goes, "One doesn't strike a smiling face." It is no wonder that Roosevelt—not the Roosevelt of today—found it difficult, and the fist of interest could not be brought down. This can be said to be a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>In short, according to the general history of Japanese-American negotiations, from one perspective, there is more than enough verifiable evidence to show how faithfully and enthusiastically Japan has been in maintaining peace between the two countries; however, from another perspective, it cannot be denied that Japan's daydreaming towards the United States, believing that if they show goodwill, the other side will surely show goodwill in return, its premature calculation, and its infatuation based on conjecture, were boundless.</p>
<p>At a certain dinner party, the author was seated next to the French Ambassador Claudel. During the conversation, Mr. Claudel said to me:</p>
<p>"What do you think? Isn't your country abandoning its good customs and traditions and becoming almost completely Americanized?"</p>
<p>He said this to me with a somewhat disgusted tone. However, Mr. Claudel's words are probably an interesting question. Judging from his words, it seems that the vulgar tastes overflowing on Ginza Street particularly stimulated him. However, upon opening one's eyes and observing carefully, Japan's Americanization is nothing but the loss of the Japanese spirit and the spread of hedonism. Namely, a certain class of Japanese people almost all hang up American signboards.</p>
<p>(2) Is Japan the England of East Asia?</p>
<p>To call Japan the England of East Asia, although it is not known who came up with this, it was a popular saying in my youth. And the people of that era were determined to make Japan the England of East Asia, so they envied, strived, and worked hard. In other words, England was once regarded by Japan as an ideal model and a standard country.</p>
<p>If we were to point out the similarities between Japan and England, then, first, both countries are island nations, and the area of their main islands is roughly the same, and both are close to the continent. Also, England is a mixed race composed mainly of Anglo-Saxons, and Japan can also be called a mixed race centered on the Yamato people. However, these are the only similarities. Geographically, both are island nations, but Japan is a so-called dragonfly island, thin and long, extending from southwest to northeast; England is balanced in all directions, east, west, north, and south. Japan is connected to the Korean Peninsula by the stepping stones of Hirado, Iki, and Tsushima in Kyushu, while the main island is connected to Manchuria—once called a land beyond civilization by China—across the vast Sea of Japan, and connected to southern China across the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, and there are few places convenient for sending large armies. However, England is connected to the continent by the narrow Strait of Dover, and London, which can be called the central area of England and is a vast plain, is also not far from the coast. If the Dutch navy were to attack England, their fleet could sail up the Thames to London to engage in hand-to-hand combat. In Japan, the places that directly rub against the continent are only a corner of Kyushu or the northeast. The important parts of the Japanese mainland are not in a position easily subjected to foreign invasion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of race, although there were distinctions between imperial, divine, and feudal lineages in the past, today, all Japanese people seem to be from the same mold. All biological, scientific, spiritual, and mental qualities have been fused together. Whether they are from Kyushu or the northeast, as long as they live in the eight main islands, they are genuine Japanese citizens.</p>
<p>However, in England, although it is also called England, Scotland maintains its distinct customs, habits, religions, and customs. Also, Wales, which occupies a small corner of the main island, is also of Celtic origin, and the Welsh language is still commonly used. Even Lloyd George prided himself on being Welsh. As for Ireland, separated by the Irish Sea, except for a very small number of Protestants and landlords who moved from mainland England, the race is almost entirely Celtic, and the religion is self-evident. Even in thought, it is completely independent. Today, even the country's name has been changed to Éire. Although England insists on opposing them, the Irish do not want to share anything with them. Therefore, even now that England is at war with Germany, Italy, and Japan, they still advocate independence and take a completely irrelevant position. Ireland's position in England is even more important than Kyushu's position in Japan, yet it is still like this. From this point of view, although it is said that both are mixed races, England is merely making different races the same or making them live in close proximity to each other. And eight or nine out of ten Irish people harbor hostility towards England.</p>
<p>With such a state of affairs, to call Japan the England of East Asia is nothing but an unexpected flattery, for which we cannot be grateful enough. As for those who actually call themselves the England of East Asia and hope to become the England of East Asia, from today's perspective, they are completely mentally deranged.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Cooked Noodle Industry Requests Flour Allocation; Authorities Promise to Consider <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities stopped allocating flour to the city's cooked noodle industry, it has been at a standstill. The industry has repeatedly petitioned the authorities to restore the allocation in order to maintain operations and the livelihoods of workers. The reasons for the industry's petition are roughly as follows: (1) Cooked noodle shops are equipped with noodle-making machines, and since the cessation of flour allocation, the staff have been unemployed, and the number is very large; (2) Cooked noodle shops have stopped supplying flour, and household flour is also not easy to buy, resulting in most shops suspending operations; (3) There are hundreds of cooked noodle shops in the city. If this continues, all of them will inevitably close down, and both shop owners and workers will be unemployed, which is closely related to social stability. The authorities' original intention in wearing these boots has not been realized; (4) The opening of cooked noodle shops is exclusively for passing merchants and general coolies to fill their stomachs. If there are no noodle shops, there will also be problems in serving society. It is heard that the authorities have expressed their willingness to consider the industry's request.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been many cases of missing children and infants in the two concessions of this city. At the same time, the authorities of the two concessions find lost children crying along the roads every day by patrolmen. After the patrolmen take them back to the police station, they are sent to charitable organizations for adoption. However, all the clothes on the lost infants are extremely thin. Generally, the woolen shirts and trousers worn on the body are tricked by criminals to remote locations. With cunning means, the woolen shirts and trousers on the children are stripped off, and then they leave, ignoring the children. The parents of the missing children search everywhere but cannot find them. It is said that this kind of disguised kidnapper appears to be organized, with two people, a man and a woman, as a group, and they bring children to deceive people. First, the children brought by the kidnappers, who have received considerable training, play together, and then they are tricked away. The two Changju have sent officers, scattered like stars, to pay attention to the kidnappers' tricks, so as to catch them all in one net.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Taking Shanghai as a Model for Japanese Cooperation in Completing the Greater East Asia War: Mr. Chen Gongbo Expresses His Views to Japanese Reporters <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram): According to the Asahi Shimbun here, Shanghai Special Telegram: Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan and Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government, is an important figure in the National Government. At a time when the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession are about to be recovered, as he also serves as the Mayor of Shanghai, his words and deeds have long been noted by all parties. Asahi Shimbun reporters specially went to the Municipal Government to pay their respects and were granted an audience, and he expressed his views, saying in essence, "I (Chen said himself) believe that the war on the Chinese mainland is a part of the Greater East Asia War, and it may continue for</p>
<p>Fifty years. I am deeply gratified that our country can participate in this great war of the century and fulfill its responsibility as a member of East Asia. The call for Sino-Japanese cooperation has now become the national policy of China's peaceful reconstruction. When the National Government first returned to Nanjing, those who felt the need to work hard were only the upper classes, but since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has promoted Sino-Japanese cooperation to the general public in writing and orally, and has achieved considerable success. Today, Japan has returned the concessions in China, and the intention of Sino-Japanese cooperation to complete the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of shared life and death has been realized and concretized. The general public can also see Japan's true intentions from this, which is something we can all deeply celebrate. Some people in China hope that the Japanese side will return all rights when returning the concessions, abolishing extraterritoriality, and returning enemy property. This is because they have lived in the Shanghai concessions for a long time, not subject to Chinese rule, and live by relying on Britain and the United States, so they have this kind of hope. This is a sea under the Greater East Asia War, which is</p>
<p>Heartbreaking. Therefore, we should continue to strive to eliminate the enemy in both material and psychological aspects of the Shanghai concessions. As for China, it should be based on political and global views, and completely liquidate the political form of only following Britain and the United States, and establish new Sino-Japanese relations with automatic action. The work of stirring up the people's hearts is the most urgent task of the National Government, and it can only be completed with the spontaneous movement of China and Japan. Therefore, I deeply believe that Japan's return of the concessions has a huge impact on the people of China and Japan in this sense. We deeply feel that it is the responsibility of the people of China and Japan to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. The task of the Chinese side is, as the Chairman said, there are many people who are now serving in the rear. We should know that in the future, we will share life and death with Japan, and will take on</p>
<p>Part of the front line. At that time, Greater Shanghai should become the center of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and the qualification of liaison money, and become the axis of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Shanghai is developing into an international city, and its remains still exist. However, Shanghai in the future should develop into the axis of Sino-Japanese cooperation and an international city in East Asia. I am eager to make Shanghai a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation in this sense and cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<h3 id="e38">Commentary: On the Reorganization of the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association has decided to amend the association's articles of association and abolish the president and vice president system and change it to a chairman system in order to reform operations to promote business. This reorganization plan tells us that in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment, the production of cotton in Central China must be promoted, and the standards of cotton production in Central China must be improved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the comparison between cotton production and consumption, we recall a sentence said by Mr. Di Xiao, chairman of the Central China Cotton Control Association, not long ago: "The annual cotton consumption in East Asia is at least 15,000,000 dans, while the output of the two regions of Central China and North China is only 6,000,000 dans. Even if we add the combined output of Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, which is 1,000,000 dans, it is only 7,000,000 dans. So the production is less than half of the consumption."</p>
<p>From this point of view, increasing cotton production is actively needed, and increasing cotton production in Central China is especially actively needed, because Central China, in terms of climate and geography, can provide more opportunities and a better environment for improving cotton production. Secondly, Central China has a relatively dense population and requires relatively large demand; even in terms of consumption, it is reasonable to meet the demand with supply. In addition, Central China takes Shanghai as its hub and has become the general hub for current material exchanges. It can supply the surplus cotton production to various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to regulate its surpluses and deficits. This is also an important reason why cotton production in Central China should be actively promoted and improved.</p>
<p>Recalling from the early years of the Republic of China to the recent past, our country has also had several organizations and several resolutions to promote cotton planting and improvement; unfortunately, due to various reasons, they have all become a historical relic in the history of China's cotton planting industry. This reorganization of the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association and the amendment of the articles of association can turn the various past relics into various future achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Shanghai Financial Figures Discuss the Current Financial Situation of China <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: According to Shanghai financial figures, the goal of the Chinese government's financial situation is not only to balance income and expenditure, but also to increase production, economize consumption, and improve people's livelihood. At the same time, tax authorities must also be adjusted, and various tax rules across the country will be simplified and unified. The improvement of the currency system is proceeding smoothly, people's livelihood is stabilized, industry and commerce are restored, and then the national treasury income can be increased and the budget balanced. The tax collection of local authorities and local authorities in this port has considerable autonomy and independence, so that the expenditure of local authorities will not completely rely on the central government. Local authorities have adopted prudent policies to balance the budget based on normal income for public expenditure. After this, the national treasury should have a surplus, which will indirectly reduce national taxes and reduce the burden on the people. Government revenue is mainly based on customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. Customs duties have increased slightly since January of last year, and the surtax is 100%. The customs offices in South China and Central China have all decided to restore them. Before the National Government returned to the capital, the total customs revenue was 20 million to 30 million yuan. After the suspension of foreign trade, customs duties decreased sharply, falling to 6 million yuan in February last year, and the surtax was also 6 million yuan. It was not until March of the same year that import and export taxes reached 9 million yuan, and the surtax was 7 million yuan, a decrease of two-thirds in import and export taxes compared to before the Greater East Asia War, while the surtax increased. By the end of last year, customs duties had increased dramatically due to improved management. In addition to customs duties, the second largest source of revenue is the salt tax. After the National Government returned to the capital, it began to plan to restore the production of salt in the war zone, and as a result, it increased from 2,800,000 dans (limited to the Haizhou district in 1940) to more than 4,900,000 dans (1941) and more than 4,710,000 dans (January to August 1942). From then on, most of the salt fields have been restored one after another, with the fastest recovery in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, and the salt tax has increased dramatically. During the period from January to August 1942, the salt tax suddenly increased from 12,8000 yuan (1940) to more than 45,000,000 yuan. Although the consolidated tax ranks third, it is also a major source of national tax revenue. The government has made its best efforts to improve the administration of the various consolidated tax bureaus and gradually simplify and rationalize tax collection procedures. In October 1941, the regulations for the collection of consolidated tax on cotton and cotton yarn were promulgated, and in April of the following year, the consolidated tax rate on cigarettes was implemented. In June of the same year, the consolidated tax rate on flour was promulgated. At that time, prices continued to rise, and the consolidated tax was revised repeatedly to suit reality. The main target was luxury goods, and the purpose was to reduce the burden on the people. At the same time, tax revenue was increased. Since April 1942, the special tax on cigarettes has been changed to a value-added tax, and cotton, cotton yarn, and cloth have also been subject to a 5% value-added tax. Recently, the transfer of the Customs Administration to the National Government, the reorganization of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau, and other measures have made the tax collection mechanism even more sound, and since China, the entire national economic mechanism has gradually been established on a wartime basis. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the participation of well-known Chinese banks and financiers have enabled national prosperity to be restored to its former state. In addition, since April 1, the suspension of the issuance of military tickets is also a positive way to stabilize the Central Reserve Bank notes and a precursor to further improvement of the general economic situation.</p>

<p>— Jian Zhi</p>
<p>But the fact is not so simple. If we analyze the nature of bank deposits, the pessimism of the situation is beyond imagination. It is found that bank time deposits are the true savings of the people and the crystallization of the lifeline of the bank's capital. As for current deposits, they are just a kind of circulating currency, and their nature is no different from banknotes. Before the incident, time deposits of the eleven commercial banks in Shanghai accounted for 60% of the total deposits, and current deposits accounted for 40%. Now, time deposits only account for 20%, and current deposits account for 80%. In other words, commercial banks are no longer the trustees of people's savings, but only the custodians of social currency. Furthermore, the people have used most of their savings by themselves and directly participated in investment or speculation. The active elements in the commodity and securities markets in recent years, including old and young women, three religions and nine streams, are proof of this. Banks are no longer investment institutions in modern society, and their low impact on economic capacity can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Under this situation, commercial banks feel the difficulty of using the managed circulating currency - current deposits - because of its indefinite increase and decrease, which is as fast as lightning. They have to accumulate preparations to prevent emergencies, resulting in credit contraction. The preparation of the eleven commercial banks in Shanghai accounted for 31% of the deposits in the 25th year, only 26% in the 26th year, and gradually increased to 46 or 7%, and only slightly decreased in the 31st year. This self-defense policy of banks naturally makes interest rates soar, which is enough to reduce national accumulation and is conducive to the promotion of policies to suppress prices.</p>
