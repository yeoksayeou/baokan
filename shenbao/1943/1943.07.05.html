<p>社評</p>
<h3>銀行公會之使命與任務</h3>
<p>最近上海市銀行業同業公會，召開會員大會，宜吿依法改組：同時修改會章，並產生理監事。據聞不久即將續開理事會，互選理事長，常務理事，主持會務，推進一切工作。銀行公會是上海市內一個堅强有力的社會團體。以往對國家，對社會，都有過相當的貢獻。值茲國家属　戰時經濟政策，實施物資統制，正需要金融團體恊助推動之際，而銀行公會恰於此時改組成立，這常然是一椿極堪重視的事件。</p>
<p>過去，銀行公會雖然不過是上海市內各種同業公會中的一個單位，但以金融爲凡百事業之母，同時，上海金融又爲全國金融之重心。因此，銀行公會之地位，遠在一般同業公會之上，有時並參與國家種種經濟金融大計，如廢兩改元，如施行新法幣政策，將以銀行公會之恊力合作始吿成功。遂格外引起政府及社會對於該會之重視。</p>
<p>中日事變以還，銀行公會工作即陷於半停頓狀態之中，六年之間，僅召開臨時會員大會一次，中間雖爲　應時局之演變，與錢業公會連撃組織而成爲銀　業臨時聯合會，但具本質，已大非以往之銀行公會可比。本年春間，復　聯合會之組織，不合戰時經濟機構體制，宣吿結果，於是金融界同人，愈　感覺有迅速　法改組銀行公會之必要。</p>
<p>溯銀行公會之成立，遠在民國四年，最初加入者，祇有中國，交通，浙江興業，浙江實業，上海商業儲蓄，　業，中孚等七家。其作用僅任聯絡情感，互通消息，故並無規模可言。民七以後，會所落成，同業　續加入者二十餘家，規模觕　，於是方有會長副會長之設置。民十六以後，復改會　制爲委員制。是時同業陸續加入者，亦達二十八家之多。但銀行公會之取得法人地位，則尙在二十年六月，該會依據當時頒佈之同業公會法改組成立之後。</p>
<p>由於銀行公會以往對於社會之貢獻，及當時各種經濟金融問題之有待解决，社會上對於該會未來之工作，愈加重視。爲保持該會以往這信譽，及增進未來之地位計，相信該會負責者，必能認淸時代，加倍努力，推利已之精神，以造福於人　社會。</p>
<p>銀行公會今昔組織不同之點，爲以往會員人會，必須有開業兩年以上之歷史，經會員兩家以上之介紹，得會員大會之通過，然後方得加入　今後則凡已領有營業執照，准許開　之銀行，均得申請入會。前者爲局部的，有　制的：後者爲普通的，無限制的。前者之優點，爲加入公會，對銀行本身是一種榮譽，因此可以增加共自尊心。後者之優點，爲旣屬開業銀行，即有加入公會之義務；換言之，亦即對於公會一切規章及任何決議案，均有遵守之義務。爲恊助政府推行國策起見，後者之普遍加入辦法，實爲時代所需要。</p>
<p>此次加入公會之會員，爲數凡一百五十三家，代表人數這福五百六十三人，較之事變以前，會員增加一百零七家，代表增加三百八十七人。誠如該會會務報吿所云：爲吾　银行史上所創見，所望該會全體會員，悉以會務之發揚光大爲前提，以恊助政府推行國策爲職志以福利社會人民爲目的，勿以加入先後，　分新舊畛域；勿因意見紛淇，致破環以往團結精神，是誠關心該會人士，所馨香禱祝者也。</p>
<p>銀行公會過去工作之表現，雖已爲社會所公認，但今日之時代環境，已與事變以前逈不相同，決非遵循舊規，即可完成使命。唯有以堅强之精神，無畏之毅力，不計利害，不問毀譽，方　　破難關，克服一切。社會之所以期待於銀行公會者如此；銀行公會負責人員之所以對社會表示者，亦應如此。</p>
<p>值茲銀行公會工作開始之際，吾人願以最大熱誠，擁護該會成功，同時對於該會之組織與工作，亦有如下之建議：</p>
<p>（一）關於組織者　爲適應工作之需要起見，應於秘書長之下，分設左列各組：</p>
<p>（甲）總務組　掌文書·交際·　務·會員登記·會務商吿等事项。</p>
<p>（乙）法制組　掌金融，　濟法令之研究，解答等事項。</p>
<p>（丙）業務組　掌金融業務之研究事項。</p>
<p>（丁）檢查組　掌同業業務之檢查報吿事項。</p>
<p>（戊）統計組　掌調查統計事項。</p>
<p>（二）關於工作者</p>
<p>（甲）督察同　厲行自肅　銀行業務及其附屬業務，在銀行法第一條及第九條中，均已列舉規定，銀行法第九條中並明白規定，除該條列舉之各項附屬業務以外，不得兼營他業，但外間所傳上海各銀行中，儘多兼營他業者，公會亟應採　同業自肅方法，　成檢查組不斷嚴密檢查。如有發現兼營他業，或故意違反政府一切戰時經濟金融法令危害民生者，應立即破除情面，報吿金融檢查處，施以制裁。</p>
<p>（乙）提倡承兌票據　承兌票據之流通，直接可以促進工商業繁榮，間接即所以促進生產，同時並可減少通貨之膨漲，故各國銀行皆積極推行。吾國承兌票據，事　前雖曾由交通銀行發起推動，終以商人忸於習慣，同業亦少　應，事竟中輟。銀行公會亟應以金融業領導之地位，出而提倡，一方可使一般銀行獲得正常合法之業務；一方亦可減少工商業資金週轉之困難。惟同時對於票據產生之原則，尤應格外注意以免發生流　。</p>
<p>（丙）提倡聯合放款　吾國銀行除少數外，大都資本薄弱尤其在存款日見減少之今日，更多是捉襟見肘之現象。故放出款項，一有擱滯，銀行本身，立見動搖。銀行公會應即提倡同業　合放款，旣可獲得資金充實，風險分散之利益；亦可避免因消息不通，彼此競做，致被利用之可能。</p>
<p>（丁）嚴禁暗息　暗息辦法，施之存款，爲幫助他人舞弊；用於放款，爲敗壞本身紀律。均非正當銀行所應有之現象。銀行公會應即通吿同业，大嚴行禁止，並現成互相檢舉，以期根本剷除，勿使永爲金融界之玷。</p>
<p>（戊）樹立良好風氣　過去上海　奢淫佚風氣之養成，論者多歸咎金融界，平心而論，銀行家平日之生活起居，不無養成此種風氣之傾向。目前節約運動，已經多方面出而提倡，所望銀行公會全體會員，尤其負責之諸理監事，身體力行，用作表率。</p>
<p>最後，吾人尙有提供銀行公會參考者，上海方面除銀行外，尙有錢荘·信託公司·及企業公司，都經營與金融有關之業務，假使他們沒有團體組織並與銀行公會取得密切連緊，對於上海金融計劃與方針，還談不到統一。銀行公會在金融界是居於領導地位的，似乎也應該幫同來解決這個問題，進一步說，也就是幫助自己。</p>

<p>朱深功績</p>
<p>北京西日中央社電　已故華北政務委員會委員長朱深氏，於繼任王揖唐前委員長　來，雖僅及　載，而其建樹至大，略述數點如次，（一）爲適　戰　情勢，故對於地方人事加以强調，在四省　三特別</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電　日東條首相致昭南印度獨立聯盟代表大會祝辭，大意謂　貴聯盟今藉歡迎領袖江特拉鮑斯氏之機會，於新生昭南召開代表大會，一新完成祖國獨立之決意，展開邁進實踐之巨步，此爲印度爲大東亞，均良堪慶賀。溯自大東亞戰爭爆發後，日軍所向無敵，未幾即，繼覆滅英美在東並之據　與要衝，同時中日滿泰各國之團結亦日益堅强相共相携手，恊力於推進大東亞共榮圈之確立，且同於必勝之信念下，爲正義而戰，今英國積年之罪惡，將悉被淸算，大東亞之黎明已至，際此時機，正印度獨立之秋，良機一失不可復得。印度志士於大東亞戰爭爆發時，即同時崛　，故　精神方面，印度已完成獨立，　氣力將竭之英國爲保其餘生，乃不擇手段，寬以武器加强其壓迫，美國亦乘機伸其　手於印度。當此之時，欲圖印度之完全獨立實非易事，故四億　印人自必須團結一致，以自己之血與奮門，以急取自身之自由與獨立。日本之希望印人迅速得償「印度人之印度」之宿願者，已在日本屢次聲明中昭示，蓋日本爲熱望完成印度之獨立已有決心，盡其全力之堅强決意，日本深祈印度內外互相呼應爲完遂印度獨立之運動益行進展，俾早日驅逐英美勢力於印度之外。目前世界情勢日趨複雜，而此時英美之陰謀策略亦益活潑，日本過去　爲信義之邦，對友以信之國，而印度亦然，故余益信印度人民於此天賜良機之時，決不被英美之謀略所惑，相信日德義三國之必勝而携手共進，爲正義而戰，確信此亦即爲爭取印度光榮之唯一大道。</p>

<h3>英國悲劇的餘論</h3>
<p>— 德富豬郎</p>
<p>（一）猶太禍</p>
<p>世界上沒有再像猶太人那樣不可思議的人種了。他們是二千年來沒有祖國的民族。散布於世界各國的一切塲　－－或稀或密，遭全世界各地的壓迫，爲二千年來世界人類的贅疣，迄今　止，其可憎的末代，尙維持着揣測的狀態。他們的人數大約有一千二·三百萬，無論怎樣的算，　不　二千萬。約占世界人口百三十分之一，然而　爲數微渺的猶太人，在任何時代，任何國家，任何塲所，皆占相　的地位，具相當的勢力，尤其在現代，猶太人深深地侵入了盎格魯撒克　民族中，盎格魯撒克　人典猶太人的關係，恰如冶遊者之典花柳病一樣密切。並確是事實，然而任何人却不以爲奇，因而猶太勢力遂漸增加起來。</p>
<p>無論有英國，有美國，猶太勢力竟　食了其國家的根本。恰如白蟻，又如蛀蝕其寄生樹的害蟲，如欲根本別除其害蟲，勢必連其樹的木身也一同砍去。現在猶太人典盎格魯撒克　人互相依懶，完全成爲彼此互恃態，更詳細地說來，盎格魯撒克　人是表，猶太人是裏。英美二國的大政治家，總之不過是猶太人的黑　巾內所鼓　人形。現在我們在這裏專就英國人來說明其一端。</p>
<p>猶太人和英國的關係，如伊利　　時代莎氏戲曲　威尼商人」中所描寫的歇洛克其人，即可想像得之，由來甚久。任何國家都曾　迫猶太人，但祇有英國是被壓迫的猶太人的逋逃之戲，因爲　遇他們，寬容他們，因而他們頓以　得了不少的財富。這歷史上的事情　暫不論，我們　來說維多利亞朝的一大猶太人　　塔　　他爲　　　政治上的立足點，表面上不以猶太人自居，竭力裝成英國的總士風度。然而他的骨子裏終究是猶太的。而他的野心也終究是猶太的，讀他所著的小說，隨便怎樣遲鈍的人　可以看　。</p>
<p>他實是猶太族的代表者，崇仰者，且爲其宣傳者。及此種宣傳的實行者。他有學部，有才藝，有　智，而他擒住了英國的第一女　，終多利亞女皇。他在獲得　性的心理上，具有非常的手腕。他到保守黨首領的地位，自然是他力能勝任而因他能充分發揮　自身的力量，故獲　英國上流社會的貴婦人的同情。而貴婦人中的貴婦人，自然瞧　數維多利亞女皇爲第一人了。　的政敵格拉特史　，有狄斯瑞利獲得女皇的寵信以　，曾受相當的待遇。然自女皇專寵狄斯瑞　以後，格拉特　　受到了難於忍受的薄待　處遇。格拉特史東　後曾謁見女皇，奉還內閣首相的印綬，女皇　這四任首相，爲國家服務至半世紀以上的老政治家，並　　言以　　歷年來的勞結，難忘對格拉特史東在其日記中，　露着飛鳥盡，良弓藏，孤免死，臘鉻烹的感慨之情。</p>
<p>沒有人像格拉特史東　女皇及皇室那樣忠誠的人了。議會雖曾屢次提出削减皇室經　案，但格拉特史東則　力加以制止。又　國庫中支出一定的金額以扶　諸皇子，皇女的成立，亦爲格特史東介　，微格拉特史東，改革君主政　而爲其和政治的提案，即在共未成立家前，有議會中或許會有若贊成者。然而對女皇及皇家效忠到如此地步，尙從女皇那裏得至了逆賊的待遇。格拉特史東之子格拉特史東子　，曾明言狄斯瑞利　塞聖　，當然這話因爲女皇反對格拉特　東的革新政策而打了折扣。　論如何，女皇最初則寵信美爾蒲倫卿，次爲皇婿亞爾培，最後　寵信狄斯瑞利，　以狄斯瑞利，在他死後，他的幽靈尙抓從頭再來女皇的心。如此，猶太的勢力，占欲了英國宮庭之最深最高的處所。</p>
<p>那麼，狄斯瑞利給了些什麼與英國呢？他從埃及王那裏敢買了蘇　士運河的股票，並立即獲得了蘇　　運河的支醒權，而聞　了到印度最近最　的通路。其次，把印度皇帝的稱號加上了英國女皇，企圖把英國在東洋的勢力在名實上俱永久不變。再次，　得了地中海要衝之一的塞浦魯斯島。繼又與俄國戰爭，努力向遠東擴充英國的勢力。造成英國帝國主義的作用者雖是張伯倫，但其閒由祖師實是狄斯瑞利。猶太人是東方人。所以猶太人談起東方的事情更來得熟悉，英國人在東洋的一切虞政，一切貪欲，一切榨取，均由此動機而來。其動機完全出於猶太的推進力，毫無疑問。</p>
<p>但鍬斯瑞利雖是一個猶太人，在私利的獲得上則比較的甚爲淡泊。他如以猶太人的貪得來幹，靠其政治的地位，何愁不立致鉅富，可是他一生雖未背債，但生計却頗爲辛勞，自罷免首相之職後，僅　北著作的版稅以度日。然而在講到公事，像他那樣不懂　，那樣放誕，那樣不依規矩而姿其機詐的人，還沒有見過。所謂「暗中飛　」這熟語，實是他開始的。（　：　自六月二十三日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>採購食米　商妥加速搬運　顧部長稱滬市供應已凖備　糧食部存米有六十餘萬担</h3>
<p>負責當局談話　近日滬市內糧食機構調整交替，兩租界戶口米之發給，不及如期分撥，延緩五天，及暫减配給數量後，四鄉非正式販米商，頓將黑市米價提高，引起一般市民恐慌，而百物亦隨之猛漲，中央社記者因糧食部部長顧實衡公幹蒞滬之，特專誠往謁，叩詢意見，承顧部長發表談話，闡明糧食行政之因素，與更迭機構之現狀，及滬市民食足以無憂，希望官民合作，茲錄其談話大要如次：查上海配給米來源，過去約有三種，一爲洋米，二爲友軍所撥之米，三爲糧食部來糧採銷總管理處所撥之米。職司當地配給之機關中，其決定方針者爲上海糧食本給調整委員會，執行配給行政者爲　食局及工部局等，担任運輸及販售者爲中支米榖組合。最近　軍停止直接辦米，故亦停止撥米，其原任撥米之責任，併歸糧食部負担。至於調整委員會，新近由上海糧食局長充任委員長。運輸各事，則改由上海區米糧聯營社担任，此皆基於新政策而起之新調整也。糧食部對於供給一層，早經凖備妥當，目前手頭存貨，積有六十餘萬担，且在各產區亦正由各地聯營社積極採辦，洋米亦由友邦協助，陸續進口，故就來源而言，已有充分把握，惟因行政及搬運機搆之變更，手續遲緩，在所難免，茲經與有關各方面協商之後，已獲加速搬運之方法，三五日內，即可陸续運到，且有關方面在上海亦存有大量存貨，必要時亦可商借移用，故根本上並無足以憂慮之處。甚盼上海市民能信任當局之措置，蓋民食問題，關係重大，欲求其順利，必須官民各方之通力合作。幸希善體販旨」</p>
<p>揚州所購一部起運　據大通社記者向米榖聯營社負責人方面探息，蘇州揚州湖州三地撥運來滬之食米十五萬包，已在啓運之中，該社爲便於向就地採辦機構接觸及啓運　料　見，故續又派員赴松江·，　江·嘉興·嘉善·崑山·平湖·靑浦一帶若干地區，因需河道裝運，故由滬雇就大批船隻駛赴當地　運。揚州米糧聯營社撥運之食米二萬包，已有七千包電吿即可裝滬，蘇州因距滬甚近，運輸方面更必迅速，上項大批食米到滬後，戶口米之配給數量，不但即可補足，且視實際狀況，隨時增加配給數量，目前可以斷言者，戶口米之配給期限，即可恢復爲每月三期。今日起，各米店並如期出售第四十期戶口米，數量暫减爲一升，售儲幣四元五角，發售期自五日起，展放至十五日止。</p>
<p>下期麵粉賣單已發　中支食米配給所，雖已將採力權轉移華方，惟該所前所採辦存棧食米尙豐，必要時經關係當道之商洽，非不可以撥借，以濟民食，至第四十一期戶口麵粉賣單，業已分發，其出售期仍爲每期十天，數量與四十期完全相同。</p>
<p>食米配給應復原狀　本市食米問題，配給機構業經調整，於本月份起，歸上海區米糧聯運社負責採購運輸事宜，該社已正式開始辦公。中央社記者昨特走訪該社負責人，詢及口　問題，據談「本社奉命成立，業已開始辦公，對採購問題，呈得糧食部核准，第一批食米二十萬石，已向蘇湖揚各地米榖聯運社接洽妥當，同時對以後採購運銷，均已有相當步驟，故以後之口糧，已有把握，無　杞憂，即下期口米，當可凖期普售。戶口米之遲緩配給及核减，實因配給機構改組所致，現各項措置已有相當凖備及完就，故嗣後口糧當可恢復蕉規，外傳謠言全屬無稽，無非乘機抬高售價，非法牟利而已，當局已加澈底查　。</p>

<p>本市各業同業公會，爲適應經濟統制之機構，力謀物資配給之平衡，及維護同業公共之利益起見，根據各該公會章程，及工商同業公會法第二條之規定，均經分別籌設各該公會物品配給組，直受該業公會之指導。凡屬會員同業，均可申請加入，享受經營物資配給之權利</p>
<p>組設宗旨　各業之分別　設物資配給組，旨在平衡各種主要或非主要物資之供應，俾杜絕非法囤積及操縱壟斷等不法情事之　續蔓延。故凡嗣後配給，將逐漸推廣，惟此項物資，並不直接配給與消費者，即非同業（非經營此項物品之公司商號）亦不克享受，換言之，乃以該公會同業會員爲限</p>
<p>限價發售　同時會員方面，一俟獲得此項物資，即須按照公會評定之限價，並經當局正式核准者，在門市發售，絕對不得私自抬價，或故意藉口拒絕發售。倘有此等情事之發生，非特停止物資　配給。取銷會員資格，且將受諸法律制裁。一面各同業於配得是項物資後。務段放置店內，任憑顧客選購，不得搬至他處堆藏，或整批售給販商。</p>
<p>入組資格　至於會員同業入組資格：（一）加入公會一年以上者。（二）能負無限現任者。（三）過去對於本外埠並無不正當營業者。（四）得本組幹事會議之認可，及經全體組員之通過，認爲合格，及徵得有關當局之許可者。（五）不兼營非法營業。而未經關係當局之處罰者。（六）能遵守本組所訂之一切章程着。（七）願担任本組指派之職務者。</p>
<p>分配辦法　惟各　物資之配給辦法，即視各該支員同業資本多寡，及營業範圍大小而定。大致分甲乙丙丁四級，少數公會乃係按照共個別認定數額而配給。顧是項物資，由公會負責向當局中請，或請當局協助，向產地採辦運滬。但各公會爲欲明悉會員同業目前存貨數額起見，故於事前通吿辦理存貨登記，此項手續刻已次第竣事，其存貨之處置辦法，尙待請示當局後決定。</p>
<h3>公共租界路名　將慎重更改　掃淸敵性色彩</h3>
<p>據日文大陸新報云：自反英美協會提倡將公共租界含有敵國意味之路名更改及毀　敵性銅像後，早由該會向工部局當局建設　在案。茲公共租界已將在日本協力之下由國民政府收囘，此種掃淸本市英美色彩之舉，何日實現，自在各方縣念之中。記者曾往記市政府公用局局長業雪松·據談稱：「淸掃敵國色彩一事，當局方面，正在充分考慮中。關於更改路名及撤毀銅像，數日前，曾與越秘書長談及，撤毀銅像一事，似較簡單，而更換路名，則須多加考慮，並出諸　重云」。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>米價的抑制與調整</h3>
<p>前天工部局發表公吿，四十期戶口米繼續配給，祇因運米遲到，不得已暫緩數日，致外間謠傳行將停止計口授　之說，全　　稽，這次米價猛漲的原因，如果與上面的謠言有相當關係，那末，旣經工部局公吿不確以後，就應該平靜下來。</p>
<p>大家都知道，米價爲一切物價的中心，米價猛漲，一切物價隨之勝踊，這種　不合理而又　自然的現象，實在不容忽視。一般市民誰有相對欷　，徒喚奈何！而負有管理糧食與物價資任的各有關當局，必須運用職權，排除萬難，作合理的抑制與調整。</p>
<p>我們始終認爲國民政府要强化地位，取得人民愛戴，最重要的工作。還在安定民生。同時，　是政府當局所歷次鄭重聲言的，那末，最關民生的米價與一切物價的高漲，政府千萬要明快果決迅　有效對策。</p>
<p>交還租界，是近日　可慶幸欣喜的事，而物價猛漲，　又合人引爲深憂。切盼當局處理有方，以　人　喁　！</p>

<p>申請擁擠原因有三　本屆申請學生　以數倍於歷屆者，其　因不外：（一）白物飛漲，生活維艱，使一般家長無力顧及子女之敎育費用、（二）類似本報之助學機構，本期或停辦或限制，致使淸　學生惟有希冀於本報資助。（三）各校學費驟增。</p>
<p>不敷支配差額必鉅　惟環顧本報現有助生，其　字　已倍於歷屆，然以學費比例，資助學金之人數，僅二知人猶感不敷。此申請之近萬學生，雖問有成績較差，或家境尙堪應付者，經甄試或調查後剔除，但不敷支配之差額必鉅，可斷言也</p>
<p>踴躍捐輸嘉惠淸寒　彼淸寒優秀學子　助之殷切，本報旣予資助於前，豈忍弗顧於後，然不敷支配之憂慮，常使辦事同人惶惶不安，深信各界人士同具此感，尙　踴躍捐輸，俾淸寒優秀學生學業不致中輟；而本報同人當秉以往精神，慎重處理，庶毋負讀者付託之重也。</p>

<h3>靜安保甲足球盛大演出　東聯三比四幾於聖葡　前半時東聯二對零佔先　小型球三省隊壓倒影星潘三省楊性華分別購義球</h3>
<p>安保甲區足球義賽，昨日下午四時　分在跑馬廳球塲盛大演出。觀衆達萬人左右。賽至中途，舉行拍　義球，小型球競拍，潘三省氏以二萬元成交，大足球一雙，各方競購劇烈，楊性華氏以四萬五千元購得，打破滬上歷來義球拍賣之最高紀錄，殊爲難得。時間旣　，首由王伯元致開會詞，　即開始小型球賽三省　影星之戰，由中村代表警務總監渡正監　球，在裁判費仁彝銀角　中展開劇　　上半時三省以三對一佔先，結果三省以七比三勝影星。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>脫離黃金的貨幣</h3>
<p>黃金爲世界貨幣的本位，已經百年了。中國昔日用銀，但因銀與金的比價，時有變動，故與金始終不能發生固定的連繋；迨我國改用法幣而後，在最初期間，雖曾以英美外匯爲貨幣的連繋，遂乃間接連屬於金，可是以後亦即脫離英美外匯連繋，一直到了新清臺幣流通以來，我國貨幣乃與黃金脫離關係了。</p>
<p>即以新法幣與日金連繋而言，在名義上雖或有其固定的連繋，可是，日本已經完全停止金本位，故上　與東京間貨幣的比例，以其購買力相對比，亦不復　黃金爲其媒介了。今日用金國家（如美國）的貨物，旣不能再到上海，則黃金已成古玩珠寶之流，不復更具有通貨的原索。人們多未明瞭法幣的性格，更未能留意中日間經濟上的實際關係，故爲之解釋如上。</p>
<p>根據如上的解釋，則今日上混的股市，紗市，以及其他各種物品的市塲，仍惟金市的驪首是瞻，非但是不合理，並且是一種錯誤的觀念。這種錯誤，誠有其複雜的理由，但即就英美而言，英國在戰後斷不能用金，而美國因存金太多，在事實上恐亦不能對他國用金，故黃金不但現在已經失去其權衡世界萬物的地位，即在將來，恐亦不能在任何方面，有什麼特殊的地位可言。</p>
<p>在今日民不聊生的一個情勢之下，假定一任金價影響物價的惡劣現象，繼續存在，造成物價直綫上昇，沒無止境的局面，其後果的嚴重，真有不堪設想者。切望當局對於此種喪心病狂的舉動，－暗抬烚赤售價，並變相增加手續費，－予以迅速嚴厲的取締。以維市面，以安民生。</p>
<h3>銀聯會籌集基金　辦理同業拆放</h3>
<p>銀行聯合凖備委員會，白將交換銀行交換差額轉賬事宜，以及同業會員對外商銀行收付專宜，移交歸中央　備銀行接辦之後，關於爲調劑同業金融所辦之邀請放，決籌的款以作基金，繼續辦理以資調劑而安金融。業經該會與中央儲備銀行接洽，以前各同業邀請放限度，規定不得超過各該得荘之實收資本及公積金之合計數，惟此後須重行訂定，在新拆放限度未頒佈之前，各同業不論資本總額有無增加，其向該會申請拆放，暫時以現在原訂契約數額爲限。凡新設同業商請訂約拆借者，暫以五十萬元爲限。至於辦法則規定，凡會員行荘如業務上正當　要頭寸，得提供財產爲担保品申請拆借，（一）政府證券，（二）華商股票及債票，（三）上海市市區內有收益之房地產，（四）凖備會公單公庫證，（五）立　可變音之貨物。拆放担保品之審擇及評價，由該會審　先擇評定之，拆放折扣倍受照規定辦　，期間定爲十日，但得提前歸還，利率內該會　時訂定之，每月底由會結　一　。</p>

<h3>集中地麥行　准許兼營販賣</h3>

<h3>上週金融工商　黑市起劇烈波動</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商市况，實質穩定如恒，公定市價仍無變更，惟工部局配給之麵粉每斤售價改爲六元二角，該週內適逢銀錢業行荘辦理六底結賬比期銀根稍緊，在中儲調劑頭寸之下，金融依然穩定。至於各種黑市情勢，因受無稽流言刺激，曾發生劇烈動盪，黑市烚赤股票紗布米糧及其他日用品市價均一致騰漲，直至週末當局嚴峻執行取締後，漲風始稍平戰云。</p>
<h3>各業公會動熊　釀造公會評定酒價</h3>
<p>上海區釀造業同業公會，鑒於目前各種酒類黑市飛漲不已，而各商號對於零售價格，亦無確定標凖，該公會爲抑平市價　求　一，於昨（三日）下午召開評價委員會，即席擬訂各種酒類之批發零售價格，呈請市糧食局審核　底取締黑市交易，並聞將來凡經營酒業不論製造採銷及零售商人，非具領該公會印發價目表，及不　實遵行出售，即須受當局之嚴厲處分。</p>
<p>珠鑽玉業將開成立會　本市珠鑽玉業同業公會，自經當局指定徐文謙馬受百程馥　等　備以來，連日經營珠鑽玉業之同業辦理登記入會手續者，異常踴躍，該支定本月十二且截止登記後，即將召開成立大會。云</p>
<p>泰各業公會開始籌備　泰縣五金業同業公會遵照新頒辦法籌備　來　曾員登記等事項告辦竣。特於本月二日上午九時假泰縣商會內舉行成立大會　推選理監事，又捲烟火　皂燭業公會業經呈奉，核准開始籌備，本月一日舉行第一次籌備會議。</p>

<h3>物價狂漲急需抑平</h3>
<p>衆認物資調查委員會之第二次會議，日內即將舉行。查六月底起，上海物價之再度狂漲，尤以食米，棉紗棉布等，漲風更厲，對於此種漲風，日前商統會唐　民氏，丁部局稻垣登氏等，均有談話發表，不久將舉行物資調查委員會，究將採取　種　策，深爲中日各方所矚目，</p>
<p>最近農產品激漲，當爲物價　貴原因之一，然主要原因，却爲投機囤積份子對最近政治情勢有　散佈有計劃之謠言，希圖鼓動全面漲風，此爲極明顯之專實。六月三十日李權　氏發表關於交還租界之談話中，曾涉及此點，七月二日　部局總務局之發表，亦力言今後對於擾亂租界經濟，威脅治安者，將不　取傳問之手續，立予嚴懲。</p>
<p>上述之非　抬價，不僅爲批發商，即另售商亦如此，最近華方另售業，紛紛忙於調換價目表，此種傾向實施斷然物價　策，乃爲中日兩國人民　首所企之願　，市經濟局曾開物價評　委員會第一次會議，規定以四月三十日，物價基凖爲最高價格　變更物價之時，非得經濟局及物價評議委員會之許可，各同業公會或會員，一種不得擅自抬價，曾以此旨通知市商會轉飭工商界，一體遵照　理，雖曾組織各業評價委員會等，實　各項　　，然批發另售商，並未遵行，　即盼物資調查委員會，迅即實施聚急　策，加以制止。</p>
<p>值此　訂交還租界條約時，而阻碍民生之物價狂　，俞演愈烈，誠不勝遺憾。值此時期，關於經濟，民生問題，　應自　　熏，集中全力以赴，此種逆時行爲不斷產生，實堪　處，此種現象之存在，　何從言報效日方之道義　置。刻下尙有一部份人以爲囤積懲處令，不過爲一時　嚇手段，無足顯忌，對於此種不法份子，必須處以極刑，方爲中國之華，大東亞戰爭之幸。（雲鵬：譯自七月四日　　新報）</p>

<h3>文藝的新價值</h3>
<p>— 鄭定文</p>
<p>人心在衰疲下去，……我們見到浮動的脆弱的現象。</p>
<p>文藝是人生的鏡子，它應該明明白白地把這種現象反映出來，至少也使大家見了覺得不安。文藝是利刃，它應該殘酷地把社會的腐肉開刀，膿血是要流的，不能怕痛怕癢，文藝是火，它要燃燒人們的心，而給人們以熱和光，力量和希望，　逐掉一切：消沈，空處……。「柔情如水」呀，「美麗芬芳」呀，漂亮是漂亮的，可是，點綴太平盛世去　，我們不要！爲什麼？因爲這些太不真實了，不真實就是虛僞，就是　惡。</p>
<p>捉牢個小　目，彎彎繞繞地說上許多話，玄妙是玄妙的？可是我們看了不懂，不懂，還能有什麼益處嗎？因此，我們也不要。</p>
<p>我們所要的乃是真實明確的文藝作品。</p>
<p>現實如果是血，我們不能說是紅　，現實如果是白骨，我們不能說是玉、我們不要掩飾現實，反之；却要把在現實深處隱伏着的醜惡掘發出來。予讀者以真的情感：這是文藝作者的任務，是的，一個文藝作者應該比一般人敏感，在　衆笑的時候，他却會感到悲哀，在　衆歡樂的時候，他却會感到憤怒……所以要悲哀憤怒者是因爲可悲哀可憤怒，但不能像林黛玉一樣的春到　秋到冬，老是淌眼抺淚，長吁短歎。</p>
<p>衆是盲目的，當它走向歧異的路時，身負　導之貴的文藝作者應當大聲疾呼地叫住它，並且給指出一個正確的方向。這裏，我們用不着打啞謎，發暗示，鼻孔裏笑，和彎來繞去的說話。應當明明白白地說「這邊走是錯了，往那邊走！」</p>
<p>文藝的價值是在乎真實，文藝的力量是在乎明確。</p>
<h3>誰的錯</h3>
<p>— 雨言</p>
<p>「瑛！幫幫忙，她又不肯量體溫了，那個尼姑！」</p>
<p>自從那尼姑進了我們醫院之後，雖增加了我們不少熱鬧，茶餘飯後，總是以他爲談話中心，但也給了我們許多麻煩，時時不肯這樣，不肯那樣，弄得大家走頭無路。</p>
<p>芳給我的差使：雖不是我願爲的，但看了他那幾可憐的臉兒，只有應允了。</p>
<p>「怎麼？又有誰開你玩笑是嗎，好師太，不要哭，誰欺侮了你？告訴我！」</p>
<p>「小姐，謝謝你，給我些毒藥，讓我死。」</p>
<p>「師太，你又在發瘋了嗎，怎麼又想不開了」對於他的時時要求毒藥，是我們刻刻在討論的啞謎，今天輪到我休息，因天下雨，沒有出去，很想把這謎打破，於是，我就開始和他攀談了。</p>
<p>原來他是一個大戶人家的女兒，你親早喪，沒有姊妹兄弟，母親因爲太愛他，所以不送他到學校讀書，只請了一位老頭兒在家中古文。他的母親，是一個虔誠的佛敎信徒，臨終時，把所有的財產，完全捐給尼菴，連女兒也送了進去，那時她才十四歲，她很聰明，又伶俐，加之讀了幾年書，所以不上兩年，就受了戒，這不覺　了那尼菴的新記錄哩！</p>
<p>我們終於談到本題上去了。</p>
<p>「我太對不起在天的母親了，」他開始訴說，　天吧！我們到本城首寫何家去做佛事，因時　尙早，就在院中納凉，他家有個兒子，在大家裏讀書，暑假在家休息，不知怎的，我們談論起來了，而且談得似乎很投機，後來，他探知我的歷史之後，就寫了一對信來，部我是否如此，當時，我囘了一封信去，把我來菴的詳細情形，自訴了他，就這樣的我們　起信來了。……非　通訊，他還介紹了許多新思想的書籍給我，這些，激起了我生命上的漩渦，我開始厭惡憎恨四周的一切，我要找夢新的生路，他也爲我悲哀，時時想營救我，一天，終於向他父母提議，要送我入學讀書，全部費用，要求他父親負担，可是，這對老頭兒却誤解了他的意思，說：「這孩兒再不定婚，要走歪路了」於是，即刻替他定了一門婚事，也是巨富的，所以重商不重學，男孩兒只認得幾個記賬的字，那位李小姐當然是目不識了，而且脾氣古怪，小姐，要一個有思想的大學生跟一個不識字的人共處一堂，一同生活，確是難事，所以他竭力反對，但無效，在這種反撃情形下，他竟向我求愛了。</p>
<p>「那不能，我是出家人。」我這樣囘答他。</p>
<p>「這敎自由，你忘了嗎，你又不是樂於出家的。」他對我說。</p>
<p>唉！他實在太好了，確是一個罕見的男子，老實說吧，我也是十分愛他的，……後來，事情發覺之後，我了良心的現備，就想到自殺，可是，天不讓我死，當我正在投　自盡的當兒，被師弟看見了，就把我解下來，不知又是誰的主意，送我在這兒－－產科醫院，聲音由悲哀而壯烈，又由壯烈而悽慘。</p>
<p>「那末，那位何先生，他現在怎樣了？」</p>
<p>「他嗎？因家中要强迫他結婚，所以他也逃在這裏一個朋友家中，昨天來看我的那個高個兒就是他。」</p>
<p>「那不是很好嗎？」</p>
<p>「但以後，……小姐，求你發些慈悲，　我閉目了嗎，怎麼，你也在哭，小姐，那太不值得了吧！」我低頭見了襟上的淚痕才知自己正在流淚。</p>
<p>「這倒底是誰的錯？小姐，你說！」</p>
<p>「這倒底是誰的錯？」我沒有能力囘答他，只得拖了沉重的脚步，離開了病房，耳邊還在響着：「這倒底是誰的錯？」</p>
<h3>生根</h3>
<p>— 祖樊</p>
<p>「孤……王，酒醉桃花宮……韓……」</p>
<p>深夜。根生才囘家，而孔喝得紅紅地；走起路來，東　西歪；　着不成調的京腔；陣陣的酒腥氣，隨着嘴巴的翁張，送入老遠的根生嫂鼻孔裏。</p>
<p>根生嫂縐眉；但心上却覺得老大的奇怪：根生生意歇了三個月，這幾天悉着買戶口米多沒錢，那兒來的閒錢去喝酒？</p>
<p>「小根爸，那兒去的？這末晚才囘來？」根生嫂問道。</p>
<p>「　！三姐，孤……打仙宮　囘來的呵！」根生還是打着京腔，拍了拍根生嫂的肩膀，走起台步來，但可走得不大像，一顛一顛地反而成了個怪模樣。</p>
<p>「得啦！得啦！對你說，咱們娘兒倆肚子餓了一天；你倒寫意，去喝酒？」根生嫂的說話語氣充滿着不平：「而且房東太也來催過了，再不付租，明兒一定呌巡捕來趕哩！」</p>
<p>根生打了個一哈哈」；接着說：「小娘兒，你凖知大爺沒錢！」才說畢，立刻打裘裏拿去捲鈔票來；向桌上一擲。花花綠綠的散滿了桌。有幾張飄到了地上。</p>
<p>根生嫂悄悄地問：「小根爸，這許錢，打那兒來的？」</p>
<p>根生這才正了正臉「小根娘，這幾天我正悉着活不下去了！今朝走在馬路上在盤算着有沒有方法可以再活下去，可巧碰着了阿六哥，他現在做了茶室裏的稽核，領我到茶室裏，借給我一百塊錢叫我試試；我把鈔票瞎甩甩，運道可真好，甩個正着這樣花花綠綠的鈔票，儘往我袋裏跑！我一樂，就拉了阿六哥喝酒去啦！」</p>
<p>接連好多天，根生多是一早就出去；深夜才囘來。而色鐵靑地不大好看；話也不說了。根生嫂一問他，就要發脾氣。</p>
<p>這夜，根生囘來得還算早。久不聽聞的京腔，又掛上了嘴；但語氣却不大有勁；而且音調有點兒慘然。</p>
<p>根生這囘帶來了三個　飯團！一人一個。</p>
<p>小根一見　飯就樂了！跳起來，狼吞虎嚥地：衹一會全下了肚！</p>
<p>根生嫂也將　飯嚼起來。</p>
<p>根生自己吃得不大快；一口一口地好像很費力。目光在根生嫂小根的身上往來盤旋：面色鐵靑着，毫無表情！</p>
<p>突然，小根嚷起來：「媽！我……我肚子痛！」</p>
<p>根生立刻發出一陣笑聲來，尖銳的，冷酷的：使聽的人毛髮聳然，怪陰森地可怕！</p>
<p>「你……你……」根生嫂覺得情勢不大對：而且自己也好像在肚痛。</p>
<p>「我……我下了毒！哈……哈……」根生又是一陣獰笑。</p>
<h3>夜工</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>被生活的鞭子　迫得喘不過氣，無血色的臉簡直像垂死的病人。在暗淡的燈光下舞動着慘白的手指。</p>
<p>不停要將棉花塞進到機器裏；</p>
<p>白色的花絮像蛇一般的海，在吞食着他的生命。</p>
<p>爲着全家老幼的生活，他是斷送了他的靑春。血·汗·靑春·生命，都被交織在棉織品裏！</p>
<p>光明！幸福！快樂！</p>
<p>他永遠是沒有份；</p>
<p>有的是無血色的臉，慘白的手指；</p>
<p>更有一顆棉絮蒙塞了的心！</p>

<h3>The Mission and Tasks of the Bankers Association</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Bankers Association convened a members' meeting and announced its reorganization in accordance with the law. At the same time, it revised its charter and elected directors and supervisors. It is reported that the board of directors will soon hold another meeting to elect a chairman and managing directors to preside over the association's affairs and promote all its work. The Bankers Association is a strong and influential social organization in Shanghai. In the past, it has made considerable contributions to the country and society. At a time when the country is implementing wartime economic policies and implementing material controls, and financial organizations are needed to help promote them, the reorganization and establishment of the Bankers Association at this time is naturally a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>In the past, although the Bankers Association was only one unit among various trade associations in Shanghai, finance is the mother of all undertakings, and Shanghai's finance is the center of the country's finance. Therefore, the position of the Bankers Association is far above that of general trade associations, and it sometimes participates in various national economic and financial plans, such as the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan, and the implementation of the new legal tender policy, which were successful only with the cooperation of the Bankers Association. This has particularly aroused the attention of the government and society to the association.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the work of the Bankers Association has been in a state of semi-paralysis. In the six years, only one temporary members' meeting has been held. In the meantime, in order to respond to the evolution of the situation, it jointly organized the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Temporary Joint Association with the Shanghai Money Trade Association, but in essence, it was very different from the previous Bankers Association. In the spring of this year, the organization of the Joint Association was restored, but it did not conform to the wartime economic structure, and the result was announced. Therefore, people in the financial community felt the need to quickly reorganize the Bankers Association in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Bankers Association dates back to the fourth year of the Republic of China. Initially, only seven companies joined: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, and Chung Foo Union Bank. Its role was only to connect emotions and exchange information, so there was no scale to speak of. After the completion of the clubhouse in the seventh year of the Republic of China, more than 20 companies continued to join, and the scale was initially established. Then, the positions of chairman and vice chairman were set up. After the 16th year of the Republic of China, the chairman system was changed to a committee system. At that time, more than 28 companies successively joined. However, the Bankers Association did not obtain legal person status until June of the 20th year. The association was reorganized and established in accordance with the Trade Association Law promulgated at that time.</p>
<p>Due to the Bankers Association's past contributions to society and the various economic and financial problems that need to be resolved at that time, society has paid more and more attention to the association's future work. In order to maintain the association's past reputation and enhance its future status, it is believed that those responsible for the association will be able to recognize the times, double their efforts, and promote the spirit of benefiting themselves to benefit others and society.</p>
<p>The difference between the current and past organizations of the Bankers Association is that in the past, members had to have a history of more than two years of operation, be introduced by more than two members, and be approved by the members' meeting before they could join. From now on, all banks that have obtained a business license and are allowed to open can apply for membership. The former is partial and restrictive; the latter is ordinary and unrestricted. The advantage of the former is that joining the association is an honor for the bank itself, so it can increase its self-esteem. The advantage of the latter is that since it is an operating bank, it has the obligation to join the association; in other words, it also has the obligation to abide by all the association's rules and any resolutions. In order to help the government promote national policies, the latter's general membership method is indeed required by the times.</p>
<p>There are 153 members who have joined the association this time, with a total of 563 representatives. Compared with before the incident, the number of members has increased by 107 and the number of representatives has increased by 387. As the association's affairs report said: This is unprecedented in the history of our banks. It is hoped that all members of the association will take the promotion of the association's affairs as a prerequisite, assist the government in promoting national policies as their mission, and benefit the society and the people as their purpose. Do not divide new and old boundaries based on the order of joining; do not break the spirit of unity in the past due to differences of opinion. This is what those who care about the association sincerely pray for.</p>
<p>Although the past performance of the Bankers Association has been recognized by the society, today's era environment is very different from that before the incident. It is impossible to complete the mission simply by following the old rules. Only with a strong spirit, fearless perseverance, regardless of gains and losses, and regardless of praise or criticism, can we break through difficulties and overcome everything. This is what society expects from the Bankers Association; this is also what the responsible personnel of the Bankers Association should express to society.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the work of the Bankers Association, we are willing to support the success of the association with the greatest enthusiasm. At the same time, we also have the following suggestions for the organization and work of the association:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the organization, in order to meet the needs of the work, the following groups should be set up under the Secretary-General:</p>
<p>(A) General Affairs Group: In charge of documents, communication, finance, member registration, and association affairs.</p>
<p>(B) Legal System Group: In charge of research and answers to financial and economic laws and regulations.</p>
<p>(C) Business Group: In charge of research on financial business.</p>
<p>(D) Inspection Group: In charge of inspection and reporting of peer business.</p>
<p>(E) Statistics Group: In charge of investigation and statistics.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the work:</p>
<p>(A) Supervise peers and strictly implement self-discipline. Banking business and its ancillary business have been listed and stipulated in Articles 1 and 9 of the Banking Law. Article 9 of the Banking Law also clearly stipulates that no other business may be concurrently operated other than the ancillary businesses listed in that article. However, it is rumored that many banks in Shanghai concurrently operate other businesses. The association should immediately adopt peer self-discipline methods and form an inspection group to conduct continuous and strict inspections. If it is found that they concurrently operate other businesses, or deliberately violate all wartime economic and financial laws and regulations of the government to harm people's livelihood, they should immediately break through personal relationships, report to the Financial Inspection Office, and impose sanctions.</p>
<p>(B) Promote acceptance bills. The circulation of acceptance bills can directly promote the prosperity of industry and commerce, indirectly promote production, and at the same time reduce currency inflation. Therefore, banks in various countries actively promote it. Although the acceptance bills of our country were initiated and promoted by the Bank of Communications before the incident, they were eventually suspended because merchants were awkward in their habits and few peers responded. The Bankers Association should immediately come forward to promote it with the leading position of the financial industry. On the one hand, it can enable general banks to obtain normal and legal business; on the other hand, it can also reduce the difficulty of capital turnover for industry and commerce. However, at the same time, special attention should be paid to the principle of the generation of bills to avoid liquidity.</p>
<p>(C) Promote joint lending. Except for a few banks in our country, most of them have weak capital, especially today when deposits are decreasing day by day, and the phenomenon of being stretched is even more common. Therefore, once the loans are delayed, the bank itself will be shaken immediately. The Bankers Association should immediately promote joint lending among peers, which can not only obtain the benefits of sufficient funds and diversified risks, but also avoid the possibility of being used due to lack of information and competition with each other.</p>
<p>(D) Strictly prohibit secret interest. The method of secret interest is used for deposits to help others cheat; used for loans to corrupt their own discipline. Neither of them is a phenomenon that should be had by a legitimate bank. The Bankers Association should immediately inform its peers, strictly prohibit it, and report each other to fundamentally eradicate it, so as not to be a stain on the financial industry forever.</p>
<p>(E) Establish a good atmosphere. In the past, the formation of the extravagant and dissolute atmosphere in Shanghai was mostly blamed on the financial industry. To be fair, the daily life of bankers has a tendency to form this kind of atmosphere. At present, the thrift campaign has been promoted in many ways. It is hoped that all members of the Bankers Association, especially the responsible directors and supervisors, will take the lead in setting an example.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have something to provide the Bankers Association for reference. In Shanghai, in addition to banks, there are also money houses, trust companies, and enterprise companies that operate businesses related to finance. If they do not have a group organization and do not have close ties with the Bankers Association, it is impossible to talk about the unification of Shanghai's financial plan and policy. The Bankers Association occupies a leading position in the financial industry, and it seems that it should also help to solve this problem, that is, to help itself.</p>

Wang issued a statement saying that since the League, he originally had no intention of re-entering politics, but at this time when the situation is becoming more and more important, and seeing that our neighboring country Japan is adopting ethical measures towards our country, he thought that he could still benefit the country, which is gratifying. This time he was appointed, but he still did not dare to be old and took on the heavy responsibility. Fortunately, his body is still healthy. At a time when the Great East Asia War is becoming more and more intense and entering the decisive stage, the mission of North China is becoming more and more important. Now that he has taken office as Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission for the second time, he is determined to do his best to be loyal to the country.</p>

In May of this year, he went to Manchuria for inspection in a private capacity with Shao Donghu, a counselor of the North China Political Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>Zhu Shen's Achievements</p>
<p>Beijing, West Day (Central News Agency) Zhu Shen, the late Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, has only been in office for a year since succeeding former Chairman Wang Yitang, but his achievements are great. A few points are briefly described as follows: (1) In order to adapt to the wartime situation, he emphasized local personnel. Among the four provinces and three special city mayors, except for the Governor of Tang Youdong Province, all new personnel were replaced. For the Governors of Hebei and Henan provinces, Du Xijun and Tian Wenbing, lieutenant generals, were promoted from the security army, which greatly reformed Chen Rong. More attention was paid to the rectification of official discipline, with the aim of sweeping away corrupt officials and corrupt officials. (2) In view of the current food problem in North China, efforts were made to solve it, such as the establishment of a Material and Price Handling Committee and a Food Administration Bureau, and various appropriate countermeasures were taken to transport large quantities from Central China, Mongolia, and other places to meet the needs. On June 21st, new food prices were formulated, which had a significant effect, so people's livelihood was stabilized. (3) In order to complete North China's mission as the rear of the Great East Asia War and cooperate with Japan, two hundred million Japanese yen were borrowed from the Bank of Japan and one hundred million yuan were borrowed from the Central Reserve Bank to consolidate the Lien Bank notes and stabilize the economy. In addition, efforts were made to ensure the smooth supply of cotton cloth and other daily necessities. Preparations were made for general price issues, and the development and increased production of food and various important resources were promoted. Therefore, the establishment of the wartime economic situation in North China was also on track. (4) Ensuring security is the fundamental problem of building North China, especially for the Communists who are lurking in North China. Therefore, Zhu reorganized the county police reserve team of the past into a security team to prepare troops, and reorganized the Anti-Communist Committee. On July 1st, the Suppression Committee was established to gather strength to establish a suppression situation, so that the suppression work was materialized, and the Communist army was given a major blow.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Chen to Manchuria Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>Chen Jicheng, our country's ambassador to Manchuria, returned to Beijing on October 27th to report on his work. He met with Chairman Wang and reported on everything. The Chairman inquired in detail about various diplomatic issues between China and Manchuria. Chen then visited Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask for instructions on everything, and separately visited Ambassador Gu of Japan to China and Ambassador Lu of Manchuria to exchange opinions on various issues of the good-neighborly relations between China, Japan, and Manchuria, and sincerely exchanged opinions, and firmly believed that this would make a great contribution to the close cooperation of the axis of the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Chen has now taken a train to Shanghai last night, the 4th, for other important matters.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Directly Operates Coal Mines and Repairs Abandoned Wells Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>Mantaoshan Coal Mine Co., Ltd., directly operated by the Ministry of Industry, in order to actively increase production, began to repair the destroyed No. 5 and No. 7 wells in the spring of this year, and purchased a large number of machines in Shanghai, which were shipped to Huangshan last month and have been generally installed. A small amount of coal has now been produced. The coal mine has transported the produced coal to Beijing for trial use by various agencies, and the heating power is sufficient and the coal quality is good. After the No. 5 and No. 7 wells are fully installed, they will be able to produce a large amount of coal, which can not only supply the needs of various agencies and Beijing, but also transport hundreds of coal per month to the Beijing-Shanghai line, the Suhu area, and other places for burning. Therefore, the repair of the abandoned wells can not only solve the future coal use, but also make a great contribution to the increased production campaign.</p>
<h3>The National Government Orders Praise for the Late Chairman Zhu</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) The National Government orders that on July 4th of the 32nd year, Zhu Chen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, has broad knowledge and outstanding talents. He has long been diligent in justice. Since the incident, he has taken care of the overall situation in the north, and his hard work and perseverance are particularly evident. After the National Government returned to the capital, it gave more support and specially appointed him as the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. Now, he has been working in his current position for several years, assisting the central government and devoting his efforts. Although he was ill from overwork, he was as diligent as usual. Finally, he passed away due to illness. Upon hearing the sad news, he was deeply shocked. It is ordered that 50,000 yuan be allocated for funeral expenses. His life's work is announced to the National History Compilation Committee to commend his martyrs. This order.</p>
<h3>Talk by Commander Okamura of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army Beijing, 4th (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>The Supreme Commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army deeply mourned the death of Zhu Shen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. At the same time, he expressed his expectations for the outstanding political skills of the new Chairman Wang Kemin. He issued a statement at 4:00 pm on the 4th, the general idea of which is as follows: Since taking office, Zhu Shen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, has been constantly working hard on construction projects. Unfortunately, in recent days, his old illness relapsed and his condition worsened. He passed away on the 2nd of this month, which is truly regrettable. In today's North China, his death is a great loss. I will continue to work with the people of North China to continue the legacy of the deceased and strengthen the momentum of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Regarding the successor, the National Government has decided to appoint Wang Kemin, member of the National Government, as the successor. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Wang has been a pioneer in building a new China, overcoming various difficulties, and has made remarkable political achievements in North China. It is truly fortunate for North China that he has taken office as Chairman again. He previously served as the Chairman of the North China Advisory Council and provided strong support to the North China Political Affairs Commission in dealing with the current important situation. I am convinced that Wang's outstanding political power and enthusiasm for building North China will strengthen the North China situation under the participation system and complete the mission of stabilizing the lives of 100 million people in North China.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Issues Short-Term Treasury Bills Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to implement a three-year construction plan, and the financial aspect should have a prerequisite method.

At the same time, Zhou, the Minister of Finance, also inspected Guangdong once and instructed on various measures. The provincial government has now obtained concrete Fangke and is implementing it step by step. It has been decided to issue short-term treasury bills from July 1st of this year, first issuing 5 million yuan in national currency, which will be borne by the Bank of China. As for the use of the funds, they will first be used for increased production and construction, development of coal mines, and construction of ships. In the future, depending on the needs, they will continue to be issued according to the plan. The total amount of these short-term treasury bills is 100 million yuan in national currency, which is entirely allocated for increased production and construction expenses. In addition, the central government will allocate 140 million yuan to be used exclusively for the purchase and storage of food in this province.</p>
<h3>Food Department Distributes a Large Number of Plowing Cattle Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency)</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food believes that plowing cattle are the main productive power of the countryside. Therefore, the General Administration Office for Agricultural Improvement of the Ministry has recently purchased a large number of plowing cattle and distributed them to the agricultural improvement areas under its jurisdiction to assist in production work. It is also learned that the Ministry has specially formulated detailed measures for the protection of plowing cattle and ordered their implementation. At the same time, the transportation of plowing cattle must also be approved before they can be released, in order to prevent trafficking and slaughter and reduce rural productivity.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence League Convenes a Congress Prime Minister Tojo's Congratulatory Message Hopes That 400 Million Indians Will Unite and Shed Their Own Blood to Fight for Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) Prime Minister Tojo of Japan sent a congratulatory message to the Congress of the Indian Independence League in Zhaonan, the general idea of which is: Your League is taking the opportunity of welcoming leader Jiang Tela Bose to convene a Congress in the new Zhaonan, with a new determination to complete the independence of the motherland and start a great step forward in practice. This is a great congratulation for India and for Greater East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has been invincible. Before long, it will continue to destroy the strongholds and strongholds of Britain and the United States in the east. At the same time, the unity of China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand has become increasingly strong. They cooperate with each other and work together to promote the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and fight for justice with the belief in victory. Today, the crimes of Britain over the years will all be liquidated, and the dawn of Greater East Asia has arrived. At this time, it is the autumn of Indian independence. A good opportunity will never come again. Indian patriots rose up at the same time as the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, in terms of spirit, India has completed its independence. The exhausted Britain is using weapons to strengthen its oppression by any means to preserve its remaining life, and the United States is also taking the opportunity to extend its hand to India. At this time, it is not easy to seek the complete independence of India. Therefore, 400 million Indians must unite and fight with their own blood to seize their own freedom and independence. Japan's hope that the Indians will quickly realize their long-cherished wish of "India for Indians" has been shown in Japan's repeated statements, because Japan is determined to complete India's independence and has a firm determination to do its best. Japan sincerely hopes that the internal and external responses to the movement for the complete independence of India will be further developed, so as to drive the British and American forces out of India as soon as possible. The current world situation is becoming more and more complicated, and at this time, the British and American conspiracies are also becoming more active. Japan has always been a country of good faith and treats its friends with faith, and so is India. Therefore, I believe that the Indian people will not be confused by the British and American strategies at this God-given opportunity, and believe in the victory of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy and work together to fight for justice. I am convinced that this is also the only way to strive for the glory of India.</p>

<h3>Further Thoughts on the British Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>(1) The Jewish Calamity</p>
<p>There is no race in the world as incomprehensible as the Jews. They are a people who have been without a homeland for two thousand years. Scattered thinly or densely in every corner of the world, subjected to oppression everywhere, they are like a superfluous growth on humanity for two thousand years. To this day, their detestable end continues to be a subject of conjecture. They number about twelve or thirteen million, but by no means reach twenty million. This accounts for about one in 130 people in the world. Yet, this tiny number of Jews has always occupied a prominent position and wielded considerable power in any era, any country, and any place. Especially in modern times, Jews have deeply infiltrated the Anglo-Saxon race. The relationship between Anglo-Saxons and Jews is as close as that between a philanderer and venereal disease. This is undoubtedly true, yet no one finds it strange, and thus the power of the Jews gradually increases.</p>
<p>Whether in Britain or America, the power of the Jews has gnawed at the very foundation of these countries, like termites or pests that eat away at their host trees. If one wants to eradicate these pests completely, one would have to cut down the tree itself. Now, Jews and Anglo-Saxons are mutually dependent, completely reliant on each other. To put it more precisely, the Anglo-Saxons are the facade, and the Jews are the interior. The great statesmen of Britain and America are ultimately nothing more than puppets manipulated within the black hats of the Jews. Here, we will focus specifically on Britain to illustrate one aspect of this.</p>
<p>The relationship between Jews and England can be imagined from the character of Shylock depicted in Shakespeare's play "The Merchant of Venice" from the Elizabethan era. It has a long history. Every country has persecuted Jews, but only England has become a refuge for persecuted Jews. Because they encountered tolerance there, they suddenly gained considerable wealth. Leaving aside this historical matter for the moment, let us talk about a great Jew of the Victorian era, Disraeli. He used the position to gain a foothold in politics. On the surface, he did not present himself as a Jew, striving to adopt a completely English demeanor. However, in his bones, he was ultimately Jewish. And his ambition was ultimately Jewish. Anyone, no matter how dull, can see this by reading his novels.</p>
<p>He was truly a representative, admirer, and promoter of the Jewish people, and a practitioner of this promotion. He was learned, talented, and wise, and he captured the heart of Britain's foremost woman, Queen Victoria. He possessed extraordinary skill in gaining psychological influence. It was natural that he rose to the position of leader of the Conservative Party, and because he was able to fully exert his own power, he won the sympathy of the ladies of British high society. And the foremost of these ladies was naturally none other than Queen Victoria. His political opponent, Gladstone, had previously enjoyed considerable favor with the Queen, but after Disraeli gained her exclusive affection, Gladstone suffered unbearably cold treatment. Later, Gladstone visited the Queen to return the insignia of the Prime Minister, but the Queen did not utter a single word of gratitude or recollection for the years of labor of this four-time Prime Minister who had served the country for more than half a century. In his diary, Gladstone revealed feelings of "when the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away; when the hare is dead, the hounds are cooked."</p>
<p>No one was as loyal to the Queen and the royal family as Gladstone. Although Parliament had repeatedly proposed reducing the royal family's expenses, Gladstone strongly opposed it. Furthermore, Gladstone also intervened to ensure that a certain amount of money was spent from the national treasury to support the establishment of the princes and princesses. Without Gladstone's reforms and his proposals for harmonizing politics with the monarchy, even before his premiership, there might have been supporters of republicanism in Parliament. Yet, despite being so loyal to the Queen and the royal family, he received the treatment of a traitor from the Queen. Gladstone's son, Gladstone Jr., plainly stated that Disraeli was a "Serpent", although this remark was discounted because the Queen opposed Gladstone's reform policies. In any case, the Queen initially favored Lord Melbourne, then her consort Prince Albert, and finally Disraeli. Even after Disraeli's death, his ghost continued to haunt the Queen's mind. Thus, the power of the Jews occupied the deepest and highest place in the British court.</p>
<p>So, what did Disraeli give to Britain? He boldly bought shares in the Suez Canal from the King of Egypt, and immediately secured control of the Suez Canal, opening up the shortest and most convenient route to India. Secondly, he added the title of Emperor of India to the British Queen, attempting to make Britain's power in the East permanent in both name and reality. Again, he obtained Cyprus, one of the key points in the Mediterranean. He then waged war with Russia, striving to expand Britain's power in the Far East. Although Chamberlain was the creator of British imperialism, its initial founder was actually Disraeli. Jews are Orientals. Therefore, Jews are more familiar with Eastern affairs. All of Britain's greed, exploitation, and oppression in the East stemmed from this motive. There is no doubt that the motive came entirely from Jewish impetus.</p>
<p>However, although Disraeli was a Jew, he was relatively indifferent to personal gain. If he had acted with Jewish greed, relying on his political position, he would have easily become immensely wealthy. However, although he never incurred debt in his life, his livelihood was quite difficult. After being dismissed from the position of Prime Minister, he lived solely on royalties from his writings. However, when it came to public affairs, no one had ever seen someone so ignorant of convention, so unbridled, and so reliant on his cunning. The saying "flying in the dark" actually originated with him. (Note: From the Western Daily News, June 23rd)</p>

<p>Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Indian Independence Movement activist Chandra Bose, representing the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech at 10:30 AM on the 4th at the Greater East Asia Theater here. Bose, in his capacity as chairman, attended and delivered a speech, strongly stating that Indians must fight to win Indian independence, which inspired the audience. Representatives from Malaya, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Burma, and other places, along with thousands of attending members, resolved to respond to Bose's speech, adhering to the creed of "no victory without fighting."</p>
<p>Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Former Chairman of the Indian Independence League, Behari Bose, stated that our movement has only been a preliminary battle. In the future, under the leadership of the passionate Chandra Bose, a large-scale fight will unfold. I am yielding the leadership position this time and am willing to work as a common soldier in the independence movement. It is most appropriate for Chandra Bose, who is unfamiliar with compromise, to take on the leadership of the current independence movement. Therefore, the independence movement from now on will definitely usher in a new era.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence Movement Enters Epoch-Making Stage</h3>
<p>Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Indian Independence League issued a statement yesterday regarding Chandra Bose's assumption of the chairmanship of the league, stating that Chandra Bose has formally assumed the position of Chairman of the Indian Independence League in East Asia today. Representatives of Indians throughout East Asia have resolved to unanimously support him with loyalty, believing deeply that the Indian independence movement, due to the convening of today's conference, has made significant progress in its glorious history. The independence movement we have launched to fight for the freedom of India has entered the stage of deploying practical action due to Mr. Chandra's assumption of the chairmanship of the Indian Independence League today. As Mr. Chandra said, we stand on the path of the final counterattack in order to win freedom and victory. Furthermore, the fact that the former Chairman of the Indian Independence League, Behari Bose, resolutely yielded the position of Chairman this time reflects a spirit of great selflessness, which can be said to be a manifestation of his noble character and revolutionary spirit. We, the representatives from various parts of East Asia, hereby express a warm welcome to the new Chairman and are willing to exert our loyalty and unanimously support the fight for independence. Furthermore, the statement issued by Mr. Chandra at the conference is a declaration of war, also a declaration to fight to save the four hundred million Indians from suffering and to win India's freedom. Our fight today is only the beginning. Our path will traverse fierce battles, but we Indians are confident that we can obtain final victory at any sacrifice. Moreover, our determination and confidence are further enhanced by Prime Minister Tojo's congratulatory message this morning, which reaffirmed Japan's determination to provide full cooperation. Therefore, the Indian independence movement today has truly broken into an epoch-making stage.</p>

<h3>Military Commander of Spanish Morocco Relieved of Duty - Spanish Government Promulgates New Conscription Law</h3>
<p>Madrid, 4th (Central News Agency) Havas News: A military communique from Spain recently announced an order issued by Franco to dismiss Lieutenant General Yague, the military commander of Spanish Morocco, and appoint him as the director of the Geographical Institute in Madrid. Well-informed sources here believe that he will soon return to military duties. Before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Yague was ordered to suppress communist movements in Asturias. He also repeatedly established merits in the Civil War. After the end of the Civil War, he was appointed Minister of Aviation for his merits, until he left office in June 1940. Regarding the question of his future whereabouts, rumors suggest that he will be promoted to General of the Army, and the position of director of the Geographical Institute is merely a stepping stone. According to what is known here, the positions of commander of the Burgos military district and commander of the security forces are still under consideration.</p>
<p>Madrid, 4th (Teletype News Agency): The government gazette has published a temporary regulation on military service, stipulating that Spaniards and foreigners born outside Spain who cannot produce foreign citizenship certificates, or whose parents were born in Spain, must enlist for military service upon reaching the age of twenty, including two years of active duty. The regulations include the 1943 conscription method: new recruits who have received initial military training will have their service period reduced to eighteen or twelve months; university students who are also probationary reserve officers only need to serve one year of military service; clergy can serve in the medical corps or as army chaplains.</p>

<h3>Agreement Reached on Expediting Rice Procurement and Transportation - Minister Gu Claims Shanghai's Supply is Prepared - The Ministry of Food Has Over 600,000 Dan of Rice in Storage</h3>
<p>Responsible Authority's Remarks: Recently, food institutions in Shanghai have been adjusted and replaced, and the distribution of rice to residents of the two concessions has not been carried out as scheduled, delayed by five days, and the allotted quantity has been temporarily reduced. Unofficial rice traders in the four rural districts immediately raised black market rice prices, causing panic among ordinary citizens, and prices of all goods have also surged. Central News Agency reporters, because Minister of Food Gu Shiheng was in Shanghai on official business, made a special visit to inquire about his views. Minister Gu gave a statement clarifying the elements of food administration, the current status of changing institutions, and that there is no need to worry about Shanghai's food supply, hoping that officials and the public will cooperate. The main points of his statement are recorded as follows: The sources of rationed rice in Shanghai in the past were roughly three types: first, foreign rice; second, rice allocated by friendly forces; and third, rice allocated by the Procurement and Sales Management Office of the Ministry of Food. Among the organs responsible for local rationing, the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee decided on the policy, the Food Bureau and the Municipal Council, etc., implemented the rationing administration, and the China Branch Rice and Grain Association was responsible for transportation and sales. Recently, friendly forces have stopped directly handling rice, so they have also stopped allocating rice, and the responsibility for allocating rice originally assumed by them has been transferred to the Ministry of Food. As for the Adjustment Committee, the director of the Shanghai Food Bureau has recently been appointed as chairman. Transportation matters have been changed to be handled by the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society. These are all new adjustments based on new policies. The Ministry of Food has long been prepared for the supply, and currently has more than 600,000 dan of inventory in hand, and the joint operation societies in various production areas are actively procuring rice. Foreign rice is also being imported successively with the assistance of friendly nations. Therefore, in terms of sources, there is already sufficient assurance. However, due to changes in the administrative and transportation organizations, delays in procedures are inevitable. After consultation with all relevant parties, methods to speed up transportation have been obtained and will be delivered successively within three to five days, and relevant parties also have a large amount of inventory in Shanghai, which can be borrowed and used when necessary, so there is fundamentally no cause for concern. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai can trust the measures of the authorities, because the food problem is of great importance, and to ensure its smooth operation, the cooperation of officials and the public is necessary.</p>
<p>The Rice Purchased in Yangzhou Begins to Be Shipped: According to inquiries from reporters of the Datong News Agency to responsible persons of the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society, 150,000 packages of rice transferred from Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Huzhou to Shanghai are already being shipped. In order to facilitate contact with local procurement agencies and initiate the transportation of materials, the society has dispatched personnel to several areas in Songjiang, Jiading, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, Pinghu, and Qingpu. Because river transportation is required, a large number of ships have been hired from Shanghai to go to those areas for transportation. Of the 20,000 packages of rice transferred by the Yangzhou Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society, 7,000 packages have already been wired to be loaded onto ships for Shanghai. Because Suzhou is very close to Shanghai, transportation must be even faster. After the large batch of rice arrives in Shanghai, the rationed quantity of household rice can not only be replenished, but the rationed quantity will also be increased at any time depending on the actual situation. What can be asserted at present is that the rationing period for household rice can be restored to three periods per month. Starting today, all rice stores will sell the 40th period of household rice as scheduled, with the quantity temporarily reduced to one sheng, sold at 4 yuan and 5 jiao per sheng, with the sale period extended from the 5th to the 15th.</p>
<p>Next Period's Flour Sales Permit Already Issued: Although the China Branch Rice Rationing Office has transferred its procurement power to the Chinese side, the office still has abundant stocks of rice in its warehouses procured previously. When necessary, with the consultation of the relevant authorities, it can be allocated to help the food supply. As for the 41st period of household flour sales permits, they have already been distributed. The sales period is still ten days for each period, and the quantity is exactly the same as the 40th period.</p>
<p>Rice Rationing Should Be Restored to Original State: The city's rice problem and rationing agency have been adjusted. Starting this month, the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Transportation Society is responsible for procurement and transportation matters. The society has officially started operations. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the society yesterday to inquire about the food problem. According to reports, "The society was ordered to be established and has already started operations. Regarding the procurement problem, approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Food. The first batch of 200,000 shi of rice has been properly contacted with the rice and grain joint transportation societies in Suzhou, Huzhou, and Yangzhou. At the same time, there are considerable steps for future procurement and sales, so there is already assurance for future rations, so there is no need to worry about it. The delayed rationing and reduction of household rice was actually caused by the reorganization of the rationing agency. Now that various measures have been prepared and completed, the rations can be restored to normal. The rumors circulating outside are completely unfounded and are nothing more than opportunists raising prices and illegally profiting. The authorities have intensified their thorough investigation."</p>
<h3>"July 7th" Anniversary Approaching - Citywide Alert Begins Today</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions and the municipal police have decided to implement a special alert starting today to prevent malicious elements from taking advantage of the approaching "July 7th" Incident anniversary. In addition to ordering subordinates to conduct strict searches, patrol teams will take turns patrolling key streets day and night to ensure alertness.</p>
<h3>Fourth Period Household Sugar Last Day Today</h3>
<p>The fourth period of household sugar began to be sold on the 25th of last month. Each person could purchase half a jin of white sugar with the fourth coupon, priced at 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen. The sale of this period's sugar is scheduled to end at 5 pm today. All those who have not yet purchased their sugar must purchase it at the designated retail stores before 5 pm today, otherwise, it will be considered a voluntary waiver and will not be resold.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Production Increases - Supply Gradually Becomes Common</h3>
<p>Various large and small mechanized coal briquette factories have now successively repaired their machines and restored their past production volume. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes has gradually become stronger in recent days, and ordinary residents have been able to purchase them from nearby retail stores for burning. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the source of coal recently has been quite smooth, so the allocation of raw materials needed by coal briquette factories is expected to gradually increase. However, some small coal briquette stores are deliberately creating trouble and selling coal briquettes beyond the limit. The authorities have paid close attention and welcome residents to report them so that they can send personnel to secretly investigate and punish them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Supply and Demand of Materials - Various Industries Prepare to Establish Rationing Groups - Rationed Materials Must Be Sold at Limited Prices - No Hoarding or Price Gouging, Otherwise, Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the economic control mechanism, strive for a balance in the allocation of materials, and protect the public interests of the same industry, the various industry associations in the city have, according to the articles of association of each association and the provisions of Article 2 of the Law on Industry and Commerce Associations, established material allocation groups under the guidance of the relevant industry association. All member businesses can apply to join and enjoy the right to operate the material allocation.</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment: The separate establishment of material allocation groups by various industries aims to balance the supply of various major or minor materials, so as to eliminate the continued spread of illegal hoarding, manipulation, and monopoly. Therefore, rationing will gradually be promoted in the future, but this material will not be directly rationed to consumers, that is, non-industry (companies or businesses that do not operate this item) will also not be able to enjoy it. In other words, it is limited to the industry members of the association.</p>
<p>Limited Price Sales: At the same time, once members obtain this material, they must sell it at the limited price assessed by the association and formally approved by the authorities at the retail outlets and must absolutely not raise the price privately or deliberately refuse to sell it under pretext. If such incidents occur, not only will the material allocation be stopped and the membership qualifications revoked, but they will also be subject to legal sanctions. On the one hand, after members have been allocated this material, they must place it in the store and allow customers to choose and purchase it and must not move it to other places to hoard it or sell it in bulk to merchants.</p>
<p>Qualifications for Joining the Group: As for the qualifications of member businesses to join the group: (1) Have been a member of the association for more than one year. (2) Be able to bear unlimited present responsibilities. (3) Have not had any improper business operations in the past, whether in this city or other cities. (4) Have been recognized as qualified by the executive committee of the group and approved by all members of the group and have obtained the permission of the relevant authorities. (5) Do not concurrently engage in illegal business operations and have not been punished by the relevant authorities. (6) Be able to abide by all the regulations formulated by the group. (7) Be willing to undertake the duties assigned by the group.</p>
<p>Distribution Method: However, the allocation method for each material depends on the amount of capital of the member businesses and the size of the business scope. It is roughly divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. A small number of associations allocate based on individually recognized amounts. The material is requested from the authorities by the association or the authorities are requested to assist in procuring and transporting it to Shanghai from the place of production. However, in order to fully understand the current inventory of member businesses, each association has issued a notice to register the inventory in advance. This procedure has been gradually completed, and the method of disposing of the inventory remains to be decided after requesting instructions from the authorities.</p>
<h3>Names of Roads in the Public Concession Will Be Changed Carefully to Eliminate Hostile Colors</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News, since the Anti-British and American Association advocated changing the names of roads in the Public Concession that contained hostile country implications and destroying hostile statues, the association had already submitted proposals to the Municipal Council authorities. Now that the Public Concession has been recovered by the National Government with the cooperation of Japan, the realization of this move to eliminate the British and American colors in the city is naturally a matter of concern to all parties. The reporter visited Ye Xuesong, director of the Public Works Bureau of the Municipal Government. According to reports, "The authorities are fully considering the matter of cleaning up hostile country colors. Regarding changing road names and demolishing statues, he spoke with Secretary-General Yue a few days ago. Demolishing statues seems simpler, while changing road names requires more consideration and caution."</p>
<h3>法兵撞斃行人家屬不擬控訴</h3>
<p>The family of the deceased pedestrian who was hit and killed by a French soldier does not intend to sue.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, at 3:00 PM, Mr. Xi She, the president of the Changzhou branch of the World Red Swastika Society, was walking on the sidewalk at the terminus of the Avenue Dubail (now Huaihai Road) and Rue du Consulat (now Jinling Road) tram stop in the French Concession when he was suddenly struck and killed by a French soldier riding a bicycle on the street. After the incident occurred, it attracted considerable attention from all walks of life. Yesterday, according to reporters, the deceased's family, due to the French military authorities' deep apologies, and the French military commander leading a team of officers to the funeral of Mr. Dai, offering condolences, and promising to bear the funeral, medical, and other expenses, the deceased's family, because of widespread grief, requested that the French military donate these expenses to various charitable organizations voluntarily and also released [the intention of] prosecuting.</p>
<h3>胡小寶被害案屍母呈請偵查</h3>
<p>The mother of the deceased, Hu Xiao Bao, submits a petition for investigation of the murder case.</p>
<p>Hu Wangshi, the mother of Hu Xiaobao, an apprentice at the Jingyi Machinery Factory at the Great Bell on West Shanghai, who was murdered in the factory late on the night of the 19th of last month, has engaged a lawyer to discuss the legal course of action in this case and has submitted a petition to the Putuo Road Police Corps requesting an investigation of the suspected perpetrator.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>米價的抑制與調整</h3>
<p>Suppression and Adjustment of Rice Prices</p>
<p>The other day, the Public Works Department issued a public notice stating that the 40th term of household rice would continue to be rationed. However, due to the delayed arrival of rice shipments, the rationing had to be temporarily suspended for a few days, leading to rumors that the rationing was about to be discontinued. All [such rumors] are unfounded. If the recent surge in rice prices is significantly related to the rumors mentioned above, it should calm down now that the Public Works Department has publicly announced that they are untrue.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that rice prices are the center of all commodity prices. When rice prices surge, all commodity prices rise accordingly. This unreasonable and natural phenomenon should not be ignored. The relevant authorities responsible for managing food and commodity prices must exercise their authority, overcome all difficulties, and make reasonable suppressions and adjustments.</p>
<p>We consistently believe that the most important task for the National Government to strengthen its position and gain the people's love is to stabilize people's livelihoods. Simultaneously, this is what the government authorities have solemnly declared repeatedly. Therefore, the government must implement decisive, effective, and swift countermeasures against the high price of rice and all other commodities that are closely related to people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>The return of the concessions is a fortunate and delightful event recently. However, the sharp rise in commodity prices is deeply worrying. We earnestly hope that the authorities will handle things properly to appease the people's grievances!</p>
<h3>申報助學金申請表　今日截止分發　本屆申請學生爲數近萬助金不敷支配差額必鉅</h3>
<p>Shen Bao Scholarship Application Forms: Distribution Ends Today; The Number of Student Applicants This Year Nears Ten Thousand; Scholarships Are Insufficient to Cover Expenses; The Deficit Will Be Significant</p>
<p>Since July 1st, when this newspaper began distributing application forms for the fifth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship to students of all levels, over 7,000 copies have been issued. The distribution will end at 4:00 PM today. Given the crowded conditions in recent days, with students of all levels coming to request application forms, it is expected that the number of student applicants this year will exceed 10,000.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for the crowding of applications. The number of student applicants this year is several times higher than in previous years. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) soaring prices and difficult living conditions, which have made it impossible for most parents to afford their children's education expenses; (2) similar scholarship organizations to this newspaper have either suspended operations or placed restrictions on this period, leaving underprivileged students with only hope for assistance from this newspaper; (3) a sudden increase in tuition fees at various schools.</p>
<p>The deficit in funding will inevitably be huge. However, considering the current recipients of this newspaper's aid, the figure has already doubled compared to previous years. However, based on the proportion of tuition fees, the number of students aided is still considered insufficient by only two out of ten people. Although among the nearly 10,000 students applying, there may be those with poorer grades or whose families can still cope, they will be eliminated after screening or investigation, but it can be asserted that the deficit in funding will be significant.</p>
<p>Enthusiastically Donate to Benefit the Impoverished and Talented. This newspaper is deeply concerned about the eagerness of the impoverished and talented students to receive assistance. Since this newspaper has provided assistance in the past, how can we bear to ignore them in the future? However, the worry about the insufficient amount of funding often makes the staff in charge anxious. We firmly believe that people from all walks of life share this feeling and hope that they will enthusiastically donate so that the studies of the impoverished and talented students will not be interrupted. This newspaper's colleagues will handle the matter carefully, upholding the spirit of the past, so as not to fail the trust of the readers.</p>
<h3>警察本部通令　防空特別警戒　昨日開始九日午夜截止</h3>

(4) When the air defense alarm begins, each bao should send two liaisons to the police corps to await orders. (5) If information is received that enemy aircraft are coming to bomb, each protection group must pay attention to the alert.</p>
<p>Special Alert: (1) From 7:00 AM on July 4 to 12:00 AM on July 9. (2) Each bao's self-defense team should have double posts on duty. (3) Each bao should organize a patrol team of three people each to inspect back and forth within the bao. (4) If there are residents living in each bao of this area who do not have a city citizen certificate for this area, they must report to this group. (5) The bao chief is responsible for supervising the liaison of the special self-defense team within each bao. (6) Investigate leaflets and dangerous goods.</p>

<p>Grand Performance of Jing'an Baojia Football: Donglian 3 to 4 against St. Portuguesa; Donglian Took a 2-0 Lead in the First Half; In the Mini-Football Game, the Three Provinces Team Overwhelmed the Movie Stars; Pan Sansheng and Yang Xinghua Bought Charity Balls Separately</p>
<p>The Jing'an Baojia District Football Charity Match was grandly performed at the racecourse football field at 4:30 PM yesterday. The audience reached about 10,000 people. In the middle of the game, a charity ball auction was held. Mr. Pan Sansheng bought a small football for 20,000 yuan. The bidding for a pair of large footballs was fierce. Mr. Yang Xinghua bought them for 45,000 yuan, breaking the highest record for charity ball auctions in Shanghai's history, which is very rare. When the time came, Wang Boyuan delivered the opening remarks, and then the mini-football game between the Three Provinces team and the movie stars began. Nakamura, representing the Police Superintendent, supervised the kick-off, and the game was played amidst the intense competition. In the first half, the Three Provinces team took a 3-1 lead. In the end, the Three Provinces team won against the movie stars with a score of 7 to 3.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, the main battle began, hosted by Ding Boxiong, with Rui Fukui as the referee. Donglian used Liu Xianhan as the four defenders, Li Tiansheng and Ning Chong as the left and right guards, and Meng Qu as the center back. The forwards were Yi Yichen, with the title of Zhongshi, and Wen Kui and Sun Jin, who served as left and right wingers. You Liang was on the right wing, and Cao Fang was on the left wing, but he was soon replaced by Wu Qixiang. St. Portuguesa's lineup was the same as reported yesterday, except that H. Pan Dasson replaced Braun. After the kick-off, Donglian's five forwards surged forward, and the connection was beautiful. Wu Qixiang hit the net, and the record was first opened. Four minutes later, St. Portuguesa's Xu Erz used his hand to touch the ball in the penalty area and was sentenced to a 12-yard penalty. Sun Jin took the shot, and the enemy's gate was hit again. In the first half, Donglian took a 2-0 lead. After the break, Donglian's Meng Youliang retired, and Zhou Qixiang was transferred to the right guard. Wu Que then supplemented it. St. Portuguesa added Gino Bobock. The offensive was in full swing, and Donglian showed fatigue. Only umbrella Tiansheng supported the defense alone. V Su Ruo passed umbrella Tiansheng, and scored the first goal for St. Portuguesa. Before long, Carlo Liequ shot fiercely again, and Xianhan lost blood and recovered. Carlo added another shot, and the score was tied at two to two. Later, St. Portuguesa Carlo Liequ opened the top and surpassed it to three to two. Donglian Li Yichen rose from the middle, crossed three passes, and sent to Youliang. Xiao Guan shot the red heart at the door, and the score was three to three. And seven minutes at the end of the game. St. Portuguesa's Robert Clark shot from the left corner of the side, and Xian Han slapped his hand, but the momentum did not decrease and slipped into the net, making it four to three. Donglian tried to counterattack, but the time was not waiting for me, the final whistle had already fallen, and then it was three to four for the early St. Portuguesa.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>脫離黃金的貨幣</h3>
<p>Currency Detached from Gold</p>
<p>Gold has been the standard for world currencies for a hundred years. China used silver in the past, but because the ratio between silver and gold varied from time to time, it could not form a fixed connection with gold. After our country changed to using legal tender, it was initially linked to foreign exchange in the United Kingdom and the United States, and then indirectly linked to gold. However, it later detached from the link with foreign exchange in the United Kingdom and the United States. Ever since the new Qing currency came into circulation, China's currency has been detached from its relationship with gold.</p>
<p>Even if the new legal tender is linked to Japanese gold, although it may have a fixed link in name, Japan has completely stopped the gold standard. Therefore, the ratio of currency between Shanghai and Tokyo is based on the relative comparison of their purchasing power, and gold is no longer its medium. Today, goods from gold-using countries (such as the United States) can no longer come to Shanghai, so gold has become a kind of antique jewelry, and it no longer has the original elements of currency. Many people do not understand the nature of legal tender, and even fail to pay attention to the actual economic relationship between China and Japan, so the above explanation is given.</p>
<p>According to the above explanation, today's stock market, yarn market, and various other commodity markets in Shanghai, still only look to the gold market as the leader, which is not only unreasonable, but also a wrong concept. This mistake has complex reasons, but even in terms of the United Kingdom and the United States, the United Kingdom cannot use gold after the war, and the United States may not be able to use gold for other countries due to too much gold in fact. Therefore, gold has not only lost its position in weighing all things in the world now, but also in the future, there may not be any special status in any aspect.</p>
<p>Under the current situation where people are struggling to survive, if the bad phenomenon of gold prices affecting commodity prices is allowed to continue to exist, creating a situation where commodity prices rise in a straight line without end, the seriousness of the consequences is truly unimaginable. We earnestly hope that the authorities will quickly and severely crack down on this kind of unscrupulous behavior -- secretly raising the selling price of gold bars and increasing handling fees in disguise -- in order to maintain the market and ensure the livelihood of the people.</p>
<h3>銀聯會籌集基金　辦理同業拆放</h3>
<p>The Silver Association Raises Funds to Handle Interbank Lending</p>
<p>After the Bank Union Preparation Committee transferred the exchange of bank exchange differences and the collection and payment of foreign banks by interbank members to the Central Reserve Bank for handling, it decided to raise funds to continue handling interbank lending for the purpose of adjusting interbank finance and ensuring financial stability. It has been contacted by the association and the Central Reserve Bank. In the past, the limit for interbank invitation and release was stipulated that it should not exceed the total amount of the actual paid-in capital and public reserve of each bank. However, it must be re-determined in the future. Before the new lending limit is promulgated, regardless of whether the total amount of capital has increased or not, the application for lending to the association is temporarily limited to the current original contract amount. For new interbank traders who request to sign a contract for lending, the limit is temporarily set at 500,000 yuan. As for the method, it is stipulated that if a member bank needs a position due to legitimate business, it may provide property as collateral to apply for lending: (1) government securities, (2) Chinese stocks and bonds, (3) real estate with income in the urban area of Shanghai, (4) public bills and public treasury certificates of the preparation committee, (5) goods that can be changed instantly. The selection and evaluation of lending collateral will be selected and evaluated by the association first. The lending discount will be handled in accordance with the regulations. The period is set at ten days, but it can be returned in advance. The interest rate will be set by the association from time to time. The association will settle the account at the end of each month.</p>

<p>The Joint Association of Grain Traders in Various Regions previously sent a letter to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee inquiring about the matter of "whether centralized wheat traders who have not previously engaged in sales can still be allowed to engage in sales."

It can be operated at the same time, but it must also obtain the qualification of a seller and comply with the seller's regulations."</p>
<h3>上週金融工商　黑市起劇烈波動</h3>
<p>Last Week's Financial and Industrial Situation: The Black Market Experienced Violent Fluctuations</p>
<p>The financial and industrial situation in Shanghai was essentially stable, and the official market prices remained unchanged. However, the selling price of the flour supplied by the Public Works Department was changed to 6.2 yuan per catty. During the week, the silver and money industry banks were handling the end-of-June settlement period, and the money market was slightly tight. With the Central Reserve's adjustment of positions, the financial situation remained stable. As for the black market situation, it was stimulated by unfounded rumors and experienced violent fluctuations. The black market prices of gold bars, stocks, yarn, cloth, rice, and other daily necessities all rose sharply. It was not until the authorities strictly enforced the crackdown at the end of the week that the rising trend slightly subsided.</p>

<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>物價狂漲急需抑平</h3>
<p>The Urgent Need to Suppress Soaring Prices</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the second meeting of the Commodity Investigation Committee will be held in the coming days. Since the end of June, Shanghai's commodity prices have soared again, especially the rising trend in rice, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, and for this rising trend, Mr. Tang Limin and Mr. Inagaki Noboru, etc., from the Commerce and Administration Department, have all issued statements, and it will soon be held commodity investigation committee will adopt what kind of countermeasure, which is deeply focused by both Chinese and Japanese parties.</p>
<p>The recent surge in agricultural product prices is definitely one of the reasons for the high price of commodities, but the main reason is that speculative hoarding elements have planned to spread rumors about the recent political situation, hoping to instigate a full-scale price increase, which is an extremely obvious fact. In a speech on June 30, Li Quanzhong mentioned this point in a speech about the return of the concessions. On July 2, the announcement of the General Affairs Bureau of the Management Department also strongly stated that in the future, those who disrupt the economy and threaten public security in the concession will be severely punished without taking the procedure of interrogation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned non-legal price increases are not only for wholesalers, but also for retailers. Recently, Chinese retailers have been busy replacing price lists. The implementation of resolute price control policies is the common wish of the Chinese and Japanese people. The Municipal Economic Bureau has held the first meeting of the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, stipulating that the commodity price base on April 30 is the highest price. When changing commodity prices, no association or member may raise prices without permission from the Economic Bureau and the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee. Although the notice has been issued to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the industrial and commercial circles to follow the regulations and has organized various industry evaluation committees, the wholesalers and retailers have not complied. Therefore, I hope that the Commodity Investigation Committee will immediately implement urgent countermeasures to stop it.</p>
<p>At this time, when the treaty for the return of the concessions is being signed, the soaring price of commodities that hinder people's livelihoods is becoming more and more intense, which is truly regrettable. At this time, regarding economic and livelihood issues, we should concentrate all our efforts. Such counter-current behaviors continue to occur, which is truly regrettable. How can we talk about repaying Japan's righteousness when such a phenomenon exists? At the moment, there are still some people who think that the hoarding punishment order is just a temporary deterrent and is not worth worrying about. Such lawbreakers must be punished with the death penalty, which is the blessing of China and the Great East Asia War. (Yun Peng: Translated from the July 4 Shin Min Pao)</p>

<h3>New Values in Literature</h3>
<p>— Zheng Dingwen</p>
<p>People's hearts are declining, ... we see the floating, fragile phenomenon.</p>
<p>Literature is a mirror of life; it should clearly reflect this phenomenon, or at least make everyone feel uneasy upon seeing it. Literature is a sharp blade; it should cruelly cut open the festering flesh of society. Pus and blood will flow; one cannot be afraid of pain or itching. Literature is fire; it must ignite people's hearts and give them warmth and light, strength and hope, driving away everything: depression, emptiness... "Gentle tenderness like water," "beautiful fragrance," beautiful it is, but for embellishing a prosperous age, we do not want it! Why? Because these are too untrue, and untruth is hypocrisy, is evil.</p>
<p>Grasping a small detail, speaking many winding words, mysterious it may be, but if we read it and do not understand, what benefit can there be? Therefore, we also do not want it.</p>
<p>What we want are real and clear literary works.</p>
<p>If reality is blood, we cannot say it is rouge. If reality is white bones, we cannot say it is jade. We do not want to cover up reality; on the contrary, we must excavate the ugliness lurking deep within reality, and give readers true emotions: this is the task of a literary author. Yes, a literary author should be more sensitive than ordinary people. When everyone is laughing, he will feel sadness; when everyone is happy, he will feel anger... The reason to be sad and angry is because there is something to be sad and angry about, but one cannot be like Lin Daiyu, always shedding tears and sighing long and short sighs from spring to autumn and winter.</p>
<p>The masses are blind. When they are walking on a divergent path, the literary author, burdened with the duty of guidance, should loudly call them to stop and point out a correct direction. Here, we do not need to play riddles, give hints, laugh in our sleeves, or speak in roundabout ways. We should clearly say, "Going this way is wrong; go that way!"</p>
<p>The value of literature lies in truth; the power of literature lies in clarity.</p>
<h3>Whose Fault?</h3>
<p>— Yu Yan</p>
<p>"Ying! Help me, she refuses to take her temperature again, that nun!"</p>
<p>Since that nun came to our hospital, although she has added a lot of excitement to us, and she is always the center of conversation after tea and meals, she has also given us a lot of trouble, always refusing to do this, refusing to do that, leaving everyone at a dead end.</p>
<p>Fang gave me the errand: although I was not willing to do it, but looking at his pitiful face, I could only agree.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Is someone teasing you again? Good Reverend, don't cry, who bullied you? Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Miss, thank you, give me some poison, let me die."</p>
<p>"Reverend, are you going crazy again? Why can't you think straight?" Her constant demand for poison is a riddle we are constantly discussing. Today it was my day off, because it was raining, I didn't go out, and I really wanted to solve this riddle, so I started chatting with her.</p>
<p>It turned out that she was the daughter of a wealthy family. Her father died early, and she had no siblings. Because her mother loved her too much, she did not send her to school, but only hired an old man to teach her ancient Chinese at home. Her mother was a devout Buddhist, and when she was dying, she donated all her property to the nunnery, even sending her daughter in. At that time, she was only fourteen years old. She was very clever and quick-witted, and had studied for several years, so in less than two years, she was ordained, which was a new record for that nunnery!</p>
<p>We finally got to the topic.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry to my mother in heaven," she began to say, "A few days ago! We went to the He family, the richest family in this city, to do Buddhist services. Because it was still early, we were cooling off in the courtyard. Their family had a son who was studying in the university and was resting at home during the summer vacation. I don't know how, we started talking, and we seemed to get along very well. Later, after he found out about my history, he wrote a letter asking if it was true. At that time, I wrote a letter back, telling him in detail how I came to the nunnery. That's how we started writing letters to each other... Besides communicating, he also introduced me to many new ideas and books. These aroused a whirlpool in my life. I began to hate and detest everything around me. I wanted to find a new way to live. He also felt sad for me and always wanted to rescue me. One day, he finally proposed to his parents that he wanted to send me to school. All the expenses, he asked his father to bear. However, these old people misunderstood his meaning and said, 'This child will go astray if we don't arrange a marriage for him.' So, they immediately arranged a marriage for him, also with a very wealthy family. So they valued business and not learning. The boy only knew a few words for bookkeeping. That Miss Li was certainly illiterate and had a weird temper. Miss, it is difficult for a university student with ideas to live in the same house and live with someone who is illiterate. So he tried his best to object, but it was useless. In this situation of resistance, he actually proposed to me."</p>
<p>"That's impossible, I am a nun." I replied to him like this.</p>
<p>"This is freedom, have you forgotten? You are not happy to be a nun." He said to me.</p>
<p>"Alas! He is really too good, truly a rare man. To be honest, I also love him very much... Later, after the matter was discovered, I was filled with remorse and thought of suicide. But heaven would not let me die. When I was about to throw myself into the well to commit suicide, I was seen by my fellow nuns, who untied me. I don't know whose idea it was, they sent me here--to the maternity hospital." Her voice changed from sorrowful to heroic, and then from heroic to miserable.</p>
<p>"Then, what about that Mr. He, what is he doing now?"</p>
<p>"Him? Because his family wanted to force him to get married, he also escaped to a friend's house here. That tall man who came to see me yesterday was him."</p>
<p>"Isn't that great?"</p>
<p>"But later... Miss, please have some mercy, let me close my eyes, why, are you crying too? Miss, that's not worth it!" I looked down and saw the tear stains on my collar and realized that I was crying.</p>
<p>"Whose fault is this after all? Miss, you tell me!"</p>
<p>"Whose fault is this after all?" I had no ability to answer him, so I dragged my heavy steps and left the ward, and my ears were still ringing with: "Whose fault is this after all?"</p>
<h3>Taking Root</h3>
<p>— Zu Fan</p>
<p>"I... King, drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace... Han..."</p>
<p>Late at night. Gen Sheng just came home, and Kong was drunk and red-faced; walking, stumbling east and west; singing out-of-tune Peking opera; a gust of the smell of alcohol, along with the opening of his mouth, was sent into the nostrils of Gen Sheng's wife from afar.</p>
<p>Gen Sheng's wife frowned; but in her heart, she felt very strange: Gen Sheng's business has been closed for three months, and these days she has been worried about not having money to buy rice. Where did he get the money to drink?</p>
<p>"Xiao Gen's dad, where did you go? Why are you coming back so late?" Gen Sheng's wife asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! Third sister, I... came back from the Immortal Palace!" Gen Sheng was still singing Peking opera, patted Gen Sheng's wife on the shoulder, and started walking in Peking opera steps, but he didn't walk very well, staggering and becoming a strange look.</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! Let me tell you, our mother and daughter have been hungry for a day; you are so carefree, going to drink?" Gen Sheng's wife's tone was full of injustice: "And the landlord has come to urge us too. If we don't pay the rent, the police will definitely come to drive us out tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Gen Sheng yawned, then said: "Little girl, how did you know your grandpa didn't have money!" As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately took a roll of banknotes from his pocket and threw it on the table. Colorful banknotes scattered all over the table. Some floated to the ground.</p>
<p>Gen Sheng's wife quietly asked: "Xiao Gen's dad, where did this much money come from?"</p>
<p>Gen Sheng then straightened his face, "Xiao Gen's mom, these days I've been worried about not being able to survive! Today, while walking on the road, I was calculating if there was any way to survive again. Coincidentally, I ran into Brother A Liu. He is now an auditor in a tea house. He took me to the tea house and lent me a hundred yuan to try. I shook the banknotes randomly, and my luck was really good. I shook them right and these colorful banknotes kept running into my pocket! I was happy, so I pulled Brother A Liu to drink!"</p>
<p>For many days in a row, Gen Sheng went out early in the morning; and only came back late at night. His face was pale and not good-looking; he didn't say anything. If Gen Sheng's wife asked him, he would lose his temper.</p>
<p>This night, Gen Sheng came back relatively early. The Peking opera tone that hadn't been heard for a long time was back on his lips; but his tone was not very energetic; and the tone was a bit miserable.</p>
<p>This time, Gen Sheng brought back three rice balls! One for each person.</p>
<p>Xiao Gen was happy to see the rice balls! He jumped up and ate them ravenously: in just a while, he had eaten them all!</p>
<p>Gen Sheng's wife also chewed on the rice.</p>
<p>Gen Sheng himself didn't eat very quickly; he seemed to have difficulty eating each bite. His eyes roamed back and forth over Gen Sheng's wife and Xiao Gen: his face was pale, without any expression!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Xiao Gen cried out: "Mom! I... I have a stomachache!"</p>
<p>Gen Sheng immediately let out a burst of laughter, sharp and cold: making the hair of those who heard it stand on end, strangely gloomy and terrifying!</p>
<p>"You... you..." Gen Sheng's wife felt that the situation was not right: and she also seemed to be having a stomachache.</p>
<p>"I... I put poison in it! Ha... ha..." Gen Sheng let out another burst of sinister laughter.</p>
