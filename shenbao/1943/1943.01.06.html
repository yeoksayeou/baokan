<p>社評</p>
<h3>世界戰局與世界新形勢</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭已經踏進第二個年頭了。一九四三年新春的世界戰局，是舊世界秩序之主角英美最後掙扎而企圖反攻，和世界新秩序的領導者軸心國的準備最後的殲滅的決戰。</p>
<p>由於這一個特點，目前世界戰局，無論是歐菲，也無論是東亞，都沒有特別惹人注意的新的發展。首先，歐洲的戰局中心，在最近一個時期，又由北菲被牽同東綫了。蘇聯利用着冬季的條件，也利用着北菲和南歐正在醞釀着的機會，從十二月中旬開始，在史大林格勒區，在中部戰區，在北方的列寗格勒區和南方的高加索區，發動了攻勢。這一次攻勢，正像一九四一年冬季的攻勢一樣，而且有着更充分更大規模的準備。推測蘇聯方面的企圖，首先是想從德軍方面，奪回戰爭的主動地位。其次，是置反攻重心於中路，以圖收復頓河地區的戰區要點，切斷德方的交通路綫，衝進烏克蘭區。而同時在南北兩區也進行着猛烈的反攻，企圖牽制兵力，尤其是北部前綫，有着威脅性的企圖。現在戰事還在激烈的進行中，前途的判斷，還缺乏重要的資料；可是，有一點是很明白的，就是蘇聯沒有收到預期的效果。雖然在若干陣綫，曾給衝破，有所進展，可是，不久之後，德軍就展開反攻了。蘇方所以不能取得預期的勝利，有着各種原因：第一，是德國方面有了一九四一年的經騐敎訓，有着冬季預防敵方大舉反攻的準備了。第二，是由於德軍在夏季攻勢之中，已有較前年更深入的推進和對於佔領區更周到的防守部署，這種佔領區的陣綫，常有數公垠的「縱深陣地」和現代化的大小砲壘與地雷設施。第三，是由於北非的戰爭，出乎蘇聯意外的，英美並沒有出其全力以爭取勝利，沒有進一步向義法展開登陸作戰，相反的，突尼斯的戰事變爲持久戰，而達朗事件史反映了英美之間嚴重的衝突，這樣，使德義兩方可以不必以更多的注意集中在西南歐洲，而仍舊悉力以應付東綫的冬季大戰。</p>
<p>大東亞的戰爭，已有了決定的勝利，英美在太平洋上的勢力和根據地，已經逐一地崩潰了。可是，我們絲毫不容忽視以美國爲首的對太平洋進行反攻的企圖，我們更絲毫不容忽視目前世界戰爭之世界性的意義，歐洲菲洲的戰爭，已不能和大東亞戰爭分割起來觀察。英美一方面在北非登陸，企圖把地中海的控制力量，從職心國手中奪回過來，它不僅有着對歐洲的戰略企圖，而且還有着對近東對印度的政略和戰略的企圖；所以同一時期，又曾在西南太平洋進行了一次，二次以至三次的所羅門海洋大戰，企圖建立太平洋上新的反攻據點，建立新的反日陣殺。可是，這種企圖，已經一次，二次以至三次地被日軍加以粉碎了。隨着北非戰爭的持久化，隨着英美內部衝突表面化，英美對太平洋方面的「反攻」暫時已告靖定了，雖然，牠們始終沒有絕念於太平洋上的反攻。</p>
<p>代替軍事上的激戰，在歐洲，在亞洲，都已展開了政治上首先是外交上的激戰。歐洲方面，民主國的政略攻勢是從北非登陸戰以後就開始了，他們這種政治的攻略，首先曾經企圖川威脅和利誘的方法來動搖義大利，一時甚目還傳出墨索里尼臥病的謠言，其次是誘脅軸心國勢力之下的弱小國家，如美國對阿爾巴尼亞和阿比西尼亞的活動宣言，戰後承認這種殖民地和半殖民地國之自由獨立等便是。第三是最努力進行的，對中立國的爭取，表現在對土耳其，對西班牙，對葡萄牙，對瑞士，對瑞典等國的威脅利誘。軸心國對於民主國這種政治的攻略戰是毫不漠視的；所以，首先有德義日强化軸心的工作，堅定了世界新秩序最後勝利的信心，義相　索里尼立刻發出闢謠的演詞，掃淸了一切謠言的暗雲。接着是對西葡兩國的活動，西葡也立刻舉行緊急會議，一面整軍經武，不惜爲衛國而戰，法朗哥更發表了反對民主的担白的演說。繼之是軸心國對土耳其的活動，也急起直追，現在德士間的經濟協定（貸款協定）終於成立了。這樣看來，民主國的政治攻勢又沒有成功，政治和外交的戰爭又陷入了相持狀態了。可是，在這裏我們不能忘記，就是政治和外交戰爭，也在太平洋上演出了，英美一方面威脅重慶政府改組，並督促渝共關係的改善，另一方面還在企圖煽動日本和蘇聯另之間的衝突，而曾經製造不少的謠言蜚語。當然，所有這些沒有奏效，而相反的，日德義三國同盟的關係有了進一步的協力，尤其是日本海軍威力在美國本土的顯揚，和在大西洋上的出現，更增加了德義對日本勝利的信心，同時「同舟共濟，緊密協力」的關係，也在最近有了進一步的表現，例如日本在華使節會議，大東亞省的會方，都可以證明。而日本和越南的談判，也有了重大的成功。所有這樣，都足以給英美對東亞政略攻勢以打擊的。</p>
<p>無論從戰略形勢和政略形勢來觀察，舊世界秩序的掙扎之沒有任何成就，軸心國之加強團結力量，都是很明顯的了。不過，今天還不是我們恣意樂觀一切的時候，我們要提醒每一個東亞的人民，反軸心國始終沒有放棄反攻的企圖，而且他們「反攻」的實力也沒有遭遇致命的殱滅性的打擊，反軸心國的內部固然有着絕大的矛盾，如英美對蘇聯，和英美本身，以及英美蘇渝之間的矛盾等待，這是無法解決的。可是，在他們愈到危岌的時候，他們之間的協同是存在的，北非之戰就是第一步表示。因此，我們說，世界戰局和世界新形勢增加人們對於「新秩序」之勝利的信心；但是，這種勝利需要更高的代價，更大的犧牲和奮鬬。</p>

<h3>西南太平洋上　美國之戰略論　損毀數十倍於日本　加強補給之重要性　·譯自三十一年十二月廿七日讀實報知·</h3>
<p>阿根廷倍諾斯·愛勒二十七日本報特派員古田電　紐約時報著名軍專記者漢　·鮑爾溫，前隨西南太平洋方面作戰之美軍，日擊日美血戰情形，歸後強調該方面戰局之重要性，屢屢發表報告，引起美國朝野重大之關心。渠強調西南太平洋方面之戰關，今已發展至可以決定太平洋全局命運之重大階段。同時，並謂勝敗之決定要素，爲補給戰，而指出該方面作戰之特異性，更大呼非將美海軍所蒙之致命的打擊從遠補充，則對於美軍固不待論；即對於反軸心軍之世界作戰，亦將招致堪以憂慮之危機。茲將其連載於紐約時報上之報告爲中心，綜括論進大要，介紹於下：</p>
<p>美方之距離上的弱點</p>
<p>目前太平洋上的支配力，大體可謂日美各佔五分，西部在日本支配之下，固不待論：東部太平洋及澳洲，新西蘭之周邊海域，則在美國支配之下。美國之新防綫，自諾姆Nome起仲至荷蘭港，夏威夷　島，由此向南伸至薩摩亞，新喀利多尼亞而及於澳洲。其前哨綫則置於連結阿拉斯加之安得利亞諾夫，阿留中，密特威（中途島），瓜達爾克那爾（Gnadaleanan）島等之綫上。和此相對，日本方面之主要防綫，則自千島經太平洋南下而及於印度洋，成一龐大的半圓形。如斯，日美兩軍在廣大的太平洋大海原上，各爲維持其距離約略相等之長大的對峙綫，不得不集中其非常的精力於距離和補給之問題上。而且在與敵軍交戰中，彼此都務使對方不能自由驅使其主力，設法加以距離上之阻礙，使負重大的不利，此點實為日美太平洋戰中最著目之特徽。因此，日美雙方無不致力於使用多數的陸軍爲守備兵，以多數的飛機充兵戰聯絡之用，更以多數的海軍艦艇護送船　。這樣，　得保持兩軍戰力之均衡。故太平洋之戰局，今後將更呈長期對峙戰之形態。</p>
<p>然而，由於今日南太平洋之戰局發展，使此龐大的日美勢力之均衡，漸有破裂的形勢。美軍之太平洋防綫中，其左翼比較脆弱，此即自澳洲至西南太平洋間之海域。美軍爲加強此弱點，以防日本之威脅起見，乃敢於在所羅門海域出擊，而進出於瓜達爾克那爾島。若美軍能在此確保堅固之前哨作戰據點，則太平洋上美軍防綫之左翼，即可望其有某種程度之穩定。是以所羅門之戰鬭，最初雖以防禦的企圖爲主而開始者，其後竞次第變成由多數艦艇及飛機參加之戰鬭，今則該戰鬭已發展到支配太平洋勢力均衡之決戰的大戰鬭了。即在此廣大的太平洋海域中，一島一寨之爭奪，其本身之意義雖不大，然而日美兩軍爲之不惜使其艦艇及飛機受到重大的損毀者，實因其結果對於全太平洋兩軍勢力關係，有極大的影響之故。</p>
<p>決定勝敗之重要因素</p>
<p>所以，所羅門海戰之重要性，在於由此戰鬭，日美雙方具得充分牽制其敵軍之全體的作戰，即有把兩軍之戰力吸住於一點之作用。日美兩軍因　在該水域之戰鬭，互相分擔著作戰上之優勢與不利，此點不可不特加注意。日軍僅就海軍言之，其作戰部隊之交通綫，比美軍爲短，因此面得保持其海軍力之優勢。然而，在補給給路綫上，因在遠離本國之地點，關於船舶，兵員，飛機等之補給，其遭遇之困難，亦與美軍所遭遇者同樣程度。故決定勝敗之重要因素之一，可謂亦　於日美之輸送力，船舶噸數，及兵員動員能力之優劣。此外，對於美軍正在大西，太平兩洋作戰，而日本則有僅在一海中作戰之利益。然而，若美軍不擬由此方向更向北方日軍佔領下之　島出擊，則亦難免不蒙同樣的重大危險，與同樣重大的損害。是爲必然之理。</p>
<p>由此觀之，美軍之在所羅門海域出擊，決不如當初所想像之單純的作戰；又其作戰目標，亦非僅限於爲加強太平洋防綫的左翼之消極意味。縱令根據日美兩當局之發表而判斷，亦可知所羅門之大決戰，正是雙方海空軍全力之大決戰，而今後且將更加大規模化的。美軍還是在這方面更加集中其大兵力呢？還是其受決定的慘敗之痛呢？現在已陷於不得不於此二者之間，擇一而處的地步了。被擲於所羅門之大賭注的，與其說是附近之諸島嶼，無寗謂爲日美兩海軍之艦隊，亦即是太平洋之支配。</p>
<p>由於今夏以來繼續的戰鬭，兩軍所受之損失，誠屬莫大，不管美國當局如何掩蔽事實，而美海軍所受之打擊，當遠在日本數倍以至數十倍之上，是爲顯著之事。美海軍初戰以來，即已受到打擊，更加上該方面之大打擊，如不急爲補充，正是對於美國之一個致命的大威脅。美國現今正是其優越的生產力表現成績的時候了，然而無論如何，所羅門方面之戰鬭結果，實繫於與海軍密切協力作戰之航空兵力及海軍之傷勢，其結果，不僅影響於太平洋全域的作戰，而且世界戰局亦有重大的影響，這是必須銘記的。　　（丁譯）</p>

<h3>東亞經濟懇談會紀實（六）　譯自三十一年十一月下旬「同盟旬報」</h3>
<p>第一部會：鑛工業</p>
<p>井坂圭一氏—朝鮮總督府東京事務所長</p>
<p>從朝鮮作爲大陸兵站基地的使命，及內地與朝鮮體化等上而看來，今後實有加倍利用朝鮮所有豐富的資源及勞働力，以期積極地開發之必要，希望各方面對此加以援助　。</p>
<p>小林采男氏—小林鑛發社長</p>
<p>朝鮮是僅次於中國及緬甸鎢金大生產地，約出產日本產最總數百分之九十。朝鮮鎢金鑛業之急迫開發，在脫出從來對海外市塲的依存　，是一個緊急的課題。</p>
<p>津田秀榮氏鑛山統制會理事長</p>
<p>（一）銅　就刻下的需要而言，大東亞圈內的銅資源決不能說是十分豐富，是非常遺憾的事。滿洲國和中國的出產，並不像期待那樣多。就是斐列濱方面，在萊邦特，拉普拉普等地，開發了新的銅鑛，對增大的需要，仍感不足。結果，除了期待我國內的增產，就別無他法。和這同時，消費之調整，他金屬代用之厲行，也是必要的。</p>
<p>（二）鉛　和銅同樣，今後也希望有飛躍的增產。將來，緬甸方面，倘能如期待那樣地加以開發的話，需要量大槪可以滿足了。</p>
<p>（三）亞鉛　在共榮圈內，安南，緬甸等的出產，倘能像預期的實現，就綽綽而有餘了。</p>
<p>（四）錳　製銅所必不可缺的錳，除日本以外，菲列濱，東印度，馬來，安南等地，都有相當數量的出產。但就現在的需要量而言，仍是不够的。因此，菲列濱錳鑛床之積極開發，乃成爲當前之急務。</p>
<p>（五）銘　作爲特殊鋼原料，近來需要忽然增大了。在共榮圈內，菲列賓，新卡萊東尼亞等地均有出產，菲列賓號稱世界惟一的銘鑛床，年產可以期待有〇〇瓩以上。</p>
<p>（六）鎳　大東亞戰爭勃發後的不久，綏萊培斯烏鎳鑛塲之利用，就成了可能。大量開發，固然是我們必須期待的，但和這同時，多最的低品位鑛，怎樣處理，却是一個問題。因此，頗希望現地能設置製鍊所，以資選別。</p>
<p>（七）錫　共榮圈內的錫生產，以馬來，東印度（彭卡，比利頓）還邏，安南等地合計，約佔世界總產額百分之七十至八十。和橡皮同樣是過剩物資之一。</p>
<p>（八）金　和銅，鉛，亞鉛等增產對策相呼應，日本以及大東亞各地城的產金事業，非加以再編成不可。</p>
<p>（九）氧化鋁鑛石　作為鋁原料的氧化鋁鑛石，在東印度之巴打，兵塘島，馬來之菊化等各地域，均有大量出產，採掘極易，品位也優艮，足供目前的需要而有餘。但將來，作爲銅代用而需要更增大了的話，採掘能力是更有擴張之必要的</p>
<p>（十）燐鑛石　號稱世界之富鑛的克利期馬斯，腦兒，屋杳三島，收歸日本治下之後，百年之大計，可說已經完成了。首先被期待的，就是從克科斯馬斯出產〇〇萬噸燐鑛石出來</p>

<h3>溫暖的友情</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>人生最幸福便是能交着個知己的朋友，溫暖的友情可以激勵出有爲的事業。雖然在左右全是「人」，但在這些人羣中，能有幾個是可算得是自己的知己呢？</p>
<p>所謂朋友便是能够眞正懂得自己的人，是不　有一點勉强存在，有一點利用存在。一味的敷衍和只顧自己都不能培養出純潔的友情。除了這些條件以外還要是個性相投，愛好相同。</p>
<p>孩童的「靑梅竹馬」「兩小無猜」時代，那不過是天眞的結合，打和駡都是遊戲，好和惡都是慣態。</p>
<p>一踏進社會，那知己太多了，也太少了。太多了是因爲左右的人全是笑臉。你如果太誠實，便會誤交許多「知己」而常你失敗和煩悶時，有的笑險變成了惡臉，有的笑臉變成了哭臉，於是知己全成了仇人。那麽太少呢？假使你是比他們聰明，你不會上當，於是你便覺到可以交的朋友太少了。</p>
<p>記得有人說：「小學中的朋友全會天眞地忘去，大學中的朋友已滲入社會客套和利用的毒素，只有中學時代的朋友中，可以有幾個成爲你的知己。」</p>
<p>這句話大槪不錯，在中學時代，根本還不明白社會的眞相，也不受到錢的魔力的毫制，所以很可能有個性所投的朋友，互相硏究學問，在這時旣無客套的習慣，但小學時代的天眞和純潔還是存在而不曾消失，再加上已有相　智識而並不是胡鬧的友情，在這種環境中那可　的友情便培養出來了，有許多事業上互相扶助的知己，大半是中學時代的朋友，這是事實的證明。</p>
<p>當你需要一個可以說說心中的話的知己時，你必須要謹愼的選擇一下，這友情是可以影響人的一生的，假使你要生存在社會中，你必須要有審查左右鄰近人們好壞的本領。</p>
<h3>記上海交響樂團第十一回公演</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>上星期日（一月三日），上海交響樂團，在蘭心大戲院作第十一回公演。節目有符摩的「拔粹曲」，特皮虛的「牧神午後之前奏曲」，「小組曲」，和佛蘭克的「交饗曲」。其中，特皮虛和佛蘭克的作品，都値得一聽。</p>
<p>特皮虛，大家知道，是法國印象派大師。他受了當時繪畫上印象主義，和詩文學上象徵主義的影響，開始把法國音樂從德國浪漫主義以及新浪漫主義的氣氛下解放出來。他一反從來鮮艷强烈的色調，以輕快單純見長。就以「牧神午後之前奏曲」而論，夏日午後那種朦朧欲睡的色調，他表現得多麽令人神往。「小組曲」分四節，每節有每節的特色，歌謠風和古代祭曲的調子，尤其是我所愛好的。</p>
<p>佛蘭克比較地傾向於古典主義。神秘的宗敎色彩，是他的特色之一。據說調是他唯一的交響曲，裏面包含的東西，莊嚴，神聖，兼而有之，聽來也頗動人。</p>
<p>看節目單上的預告，下星期日（一月十日）有裴多芬，萊司皮基，帕岡尼尼，羅茜尼等節目，大槪比上一次還要精彩得多。愛好音樂的朋友，不妨去一試。地點仍在蘭心。</p>
<h3>活動樣品</h3>
<p>— 紅荔</p>
<p>只要在上海走，無論是什麽地　，都可以看到店面玻璃橱窗內的樣品。這種樣品，什麼都　，隨着各家生意的不同，也各各不同。牠們以美觀，奇特的姿態，來招徠顧客，足見其煞費苦心。</p>
<p>尤其這兩天，凡是各大公司，各大商店，都爭妍鬥艷的將各式樣品陳列着，弄得一些貪婪者目眩神搖。的確，這太易吸引人了，那雪白高大的模　兒身上，披上一件最新式最漂亮的大衣，再戴上一副皮手套，亭亭地立在那裏，怎會使人不羨慕呢？，無怪有錢的歡喜摩登的人都來披上一襲萬元的重裘，戴上一副貴重而美觀的手套，這種闊綽的裝束，在他們內心中也沾沾自喜吧！</p>
<p>可是，無錢的人，却可望而不可即，心中雖　飽食暖衣，但少的是錢，這些衣服，除了有錢的人去購買之外，就只有無知的模特兒才有福消受，每每看到橱窗內的「木頭人」，穿得好像「神采奕奕」，而睡在橱窗外衣不蔽體的赤貧者，却凍僵在怒吼的朔風中。</p>
<p>人與模特的不同，是在神經知覺上分別，活的人有神經，所以有知覺，反之，神經麻木的人就是一個呆木鷄！這批穿了重裘，吃了羊羔的富人們，如果他們對於一批凍死的餓死的人而無惻隱之心，豈非神經是麻木了？至少豈不是神經失了效用？豈不也和櫥窗中的模特兒一樣，看他們一副好漂亮的造糞機器，自得其樂的搖晃在路上，而共實祇是一個活動的樣品罷了。</p>
<h3>赫胥黎論人類不死問題　　—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>大約在二十年以前，那時我還是一個兒童，我讀到了哈密爾頓（Hamilton）論到無條件狀態的文章，從那時一直到現在，本體論這棟臆說，在我看來，不過是一種妄談。曼塞爾（Mansel）。在正敎方面繼續了哈密爾頓的話頭，這時我不免要說，他使我記起的不是別的事，乃是荷加次（Hogarth）的圖畫中那個鋸去化所坐的樹枝的人。不過這是順便說起的。</p>
<p>我不能够設想我的人格是和我的生命的現象分離的東西。我要想　樣形成槪念時，我發現，正如柯立志（Coleridge）所說，我不過將一個字眼實體化，如果我和費希德（Fichte）一樣，以爲宇宙不是別的，而只是我的人格的顯示，這也不會有什麽改變。現在我比了從前，旣不更加堅持，也不更加不堅持。</p>
<p>我自己與禽獸之間的無限差別，也不能改變這個情形。我不知道禽獸死了之後，究竟有沒有什麼存在。我更不知道，我們與牠們之間的無限差別，會不會因牠們的繼續存在和我的死後顯然消　，而得不到袖報，正像一年生植物的球莖是活着的，而牠所放的鮮花却已經死去了。</p>
<p>當然，這是很消楚的，智巧的人身模稜兩可的言論，會給他的夢想找到種種類似的束西。如果告訴我說，人類的企求—甚至我自己最高的企求—使我趨向不死的學說，這也於我無用我自始　懷恨道種企求的事實，不過即便這果然是如此了，也不見得有什麽用這只是危詞聳聽？要我相信一件我所喜歡的東西罷了。</p>
<p>科學已經　相反的功課敎會了我。她警告我，我採取那與偏見一同躍起的見解時，要仔細，對於這種信仰，比了　於我以前反　　信仰，要獲得更有力的　據。</p>
<p>我的職務是要敎訓我的企求與事實相合，不要使事實與我的企求相調和。</p>
<p>科學用最高的和最强的態度所敎訓我的，似乎是一種偉人的眞理，這眞理包容在基督敎完全順服上帝意旨的槪念中。像小孩子那樣在事實的面前坐下來吧，準備放棄每一個預存的意念吧，謙卑地跟着大自然走向任何深淵去吧，吾則你就學不到什麽。我已經心甘冒一切危險而從事於此，我現在只開始在學心理上的滿足與和平。</p>
<p>然而有助於人類不死說的其他話頭，還是有的，這些話頭，在我看來不但是惑人的，並且是有害的。　中有一個意念　說，世界上道德的政府，要是沒有來世的獎懲制度，到底是不完全的。是他一意念是：這樣一個制度實除的道德所不　少的，我相信這兩句武斷的敎學，就是很有害的謊言。（未完）</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>也許這是對的。他記得第一次管理預備功課時的非常難堪，一個九月裏的日落時，就好像過了半世紀以上；大課堂裏盡是壯健的蠻人，準備將他黨作合法的獵物，撲到他的身上來。他年紀輕輕，嬌嫩的面貌，高的領，留着側鬚的下頤（那時人們所通行的怪相），完全要受那五百個放肆的惡漢的擺佈，對於他們，侮弄新敎師是他們的拿手好戲，最有興趣的消遣，並且也是傳統的習慣。如果一個一個地看，他們都是還算好的小叫化，可是合成了一羣暴徒，那就殘酷而不能理喻了。他一上講堂，立到寫字桌邊，立刻來了一陣靜默；他要遮掩他的心神不寧，故意蹙起了額頭；長長的掛鐘在他的背後的嗒地響着，墨水和油漆都發出了氣味；血紅的太陽，一片片由染汚的玻璃窗裏斜射進來。有人掉下了桌子上的蓋板。很快，他必須使人吃驚；他必須表示，他並沒有什麼無聊舉動。「你，第五排的—你，紅頭髮的—你叫什麽名字？」「柯萊（Colley），先生。」「很好，柯萊，你抄書一百行。」從此就再也沒有麻煩。他已經得勝了第一仗。</p>
<p>若干年後，柯萊巳是倫敦參事會的會員，從男爵，還兼着其他各種職務，那時他送他的兒子（也是紅頭髮的）到勃洛克菲爾德來，吉普斯要說：「柯萊，你的父親是我在二十五年以前初到這裏來時第一個受我懲罰的人。那時他是應該受的，而現在則你是應該受的了。」他們大家怎樣地大笑呀！里却德（Richard）爵士的兒子在下星期日的家信中講到這事，里却德爵士也怎樣地大笑呀！</p>
<p>這事以後數年，這事以後多年，甚至還有一個　好的笑話。因爲另一個柯萊剛剛來到—第一個柯萊的孫子。吉普斯又會說出下面的話，說時一連串的小小「呃哼—嗯，」好像打着節拍，這時他已經有這個習慣了；「細萊，你是—呃哼—遺傳慣例上—呃哼—最好的的榜樣。我記得你的祖父—呃哼—他永遠弄小懂，客位獨立詞」（Ablative　Absolute）。你的祖父是一個笨虫。你的父親也是的—呃哼—我記得他—他常遠遠地坐在牆邊那個桌子上—他也不見得更好些。不過我的確相信—我親愛的柯萊—你是—呃哼—這一夥裏最大的傻子！一哄堂大笑。（三）</p>

        <h1>1943.01.06</h1>
<h3>World War Situation and the New World Order</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has already entered its second year. The world war situation in the new spring of 1943 is a final struggle by the Allies, led by Britain and the United States, the protagonists of the old world order, attempting a counteroffensive, and the Axis powers, the leaders of the new world order, preparing for a final decisive battle of annihilation.</p>
<p>Due to this characteristic, the current world war situation, whether in Europe or Africa, or in East Asia, does not have any particularly noteworthy new developments. First, the center of the European war situation has recently been shifted from North Africa to the Eastern Front. Taking advantage of the winter conditions, and also taking advantage of the opportunities brewing in North Africa and Southern Europe, the Soviet Union launched offensives from mid-December in the Stalingrad area, in the central war zone, in the Leningrad area in the north, and in the Caucasus area in the south. This offensive, like the offensive in the winter of 1941, has been prepared more fully and on a larger scale. It is speculated that the Soviet side's intention is, first of all, to regain the initiative in the war from the German side. Secondly, it is to place the focus of the counteroffensive on the central route, in order to recover the key points of the war zone in the Don River region, cut off the German transportation lines, and advance into the Ukrainian region. At the same time, fierce counteroffensives are also being carried out in the northern and southern regions, attempting to contain forces, especially on the northern front, with threatening intentions. The war is still going on fiercely, and there is still a lack of important data for judging the future; however, one thing is very clear, and that is that the Soviet Union has not achieved the expected results. Although some fronts have been broken through and some progress has been made, the German army launched a counteroffensive soon after. There are various reasons why the Soviet side failed to achieve the expected victory: First, the German side has learned from the experiences of 1941 and is prepared to prevent a large-scale enemy counteroffensive in winter. Second, due to the German army's deeper advance and more thorough defense deployment in the occupied areas during the summer offensive than in the previous year, the front lines of these occupied areas often have several kilometers of "deep positions" and modern large and small artillery fortresses and mine facilities. Third, due to the war in North Africa, unexpectedly to the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States did not exert their full strength to win, and did not further launch landing operations toward Italy and France. On the contrary, the war in Tunisia became a protracted war, and the Darlan Affair reflected a serious conflict between Britain and the United States. In this way, Germany and Italy can avoid concentrating more attention on Southwestern Europe and still devote all their efforts to dealing with the winter war on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has already had a decisive victory, and the power and bases of Britain and the United States in the Pacific have collapsed one by one. However, we must not in the slightest neglect the attempt of the United States to launch a counteroffensive in the Pacific, and we must not in the slightest neglect the world-wide significance of the current world war. The war in Europe and Africa cannot be separated from the Greater East Asia War for observation. On the one hand, Britain and the United States landed in North Africa, attempting to regain control of the Mediterranean from the Axis powers. It not only has strategic intentions for Europe, but also political and strategic intentions for the Near East and India; therefore, in the same period, it also conducted one, two, or even three major naval battles in the Solomon Islands in the Southwest Pacific, attempting to establish new counteroffensive strongholds in the Pacific and establish new anti-Japanese lines of defense. However, this attempt has been crushed by the Japanese army once, twice, and even three times. With the protracted war in North Africa, and with the surfacing of internal conflicts between Britain and the United States, the British and American "counteroffensive" in the Pacific has temporarily come to a standstill, although they have never given up their counteroffensive in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Instead of fierce military battles, both in Europe and Asia, fierce political and especially diplomatic battles have unfolded. In Europe, the political offensive of the democratic countries began after the North African landing operation. This political strategy first attempted to shake Italy by means of threats and inducements. For a time, there were even rumors of Mussolini being ill. Secondly, it was to lure and threaten the weak countries under the influence of the Axis powers, such as the United States' declaration of activities towards Albania and Abyssinia, and the post-war recognition of the freedom and independence of these colonial and semi-colonial countries. The third and most vigorous effort was the struggle for neutral countries, manifested in threats and inducements to countries such as Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden. The Axis powers did not ignore this political strategy of the democratic countries; therefore, first of all, Germany, Italy, and Japan strengthened the work of the Axis, strengthened the confidence in the final victory of the new world order, and the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini immediately issued a speech to refute the rumors, sweeping away all the dark clouds of rumors. Then there was activity towards Spain and Portugal, and Spain and Portugal immediately held an emergency meeting, strengthening their military and preparing to fight to defend their country, and Franco even made a frank speech against democracy. Following this was the Axis powers' activities towards Turkey, which also caught up quickly, and now the economic agreement (loan agreement) between Germany and Turkey has finally been established. Seen in this way, the political offensive of the democratic countries has not succeeded again, and the war of politics and diplomacy has fallen into a stalemate again. However, we must not forget here that political and diplomatic warfare has also been staged in the Pacific. On the one hand, Britain and the United States threatened the Chongqing government to reorganize and urged the improvement of the relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists. On the other hand, they were still trying to instigate conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, and had created many rumors. Of course, all of these have not worked, and on the contrary, the relationship of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy has had further cooperation, especially the manifestation of the power of the Japanese Navy in the mainland United States and its appearance in the Atlantic Ocean, which has further increased Germany and Italy's confidence in Japan's victory. At the same time, the relationship of "riding in the same boat and cooperating closely" has also had further manifestation recently, such as the Japanese envoys' conference in China and the meeting of the Greater East Asia Ministry, which can all prove this. And the negotiations between Japan and Vietnam have also had a major success. All of these are enough to strike a blow at the British and American political offensive against East Asia.</p>
<p>Whether viewed from the strategic situation or the political situation, it is very obvious that the struggle of the old world order has not achieved anything, and the Axis powers have strengthened their united strength. However, today is not the time for us to be arbitrarily optimistic about everything. We must remind every East Asian people that the anti-Axis powers have not given up their attempt to counterattack, and that their strength for "counterattack" has not suffered a fatal or annihilating blow. There are indeed huge contradictions within the anti-Axis powers, such as the contradictions between Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union, and between Britain and the United States themselves, as well as between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, which cannot be resolved. However, when they are in more danger, there is cooperation between them. The battle in North Africa is the first step in this regard. Therefore, we say that the world war situation and the new world order increase people's confidence in the victory of the "new order"; however, this victory requires a higher price, greater sacrifice, and struggle.</p>
<h3>German Troops on the Eastern Front Take Advantage of Opportunities to Continue Local Offensives, Occupying One Soviet Base</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: Today's German military report stated that the Soviet troops attacking in the Kandalaksha area were defeated yesterday, suffering heavy losses in manpower and material resources. Several besieged Soviet troops have been annihilated, and our troops have seized a large amount of military supplies. A Soviet base in western Caucasus has been occupied. German fighter planes attacked the port facilities of Gelendzhik, dispersing Soviet transport troops on a certain road along the coast. Soviet troops attacking within the Terek region were repelled. Fierce fighting continues in the Don River area. Soviet troops in the central sector lost 14 tanks. Soviet infantry attacks south of Lake Ilmen failed. Soviet troops attacking within the Volkhov and Leningrad areas were repelled.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The Haitong News Agency today received information from military sources stating that the fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front has decreased in intensity due to heavy snow, icy roads, and heavy Soviet losses. German troops are taking advantage of opportunities to continue local offensives. Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. The situation has not changed yesterday. Soviet troops continued to attack at various points on Monday without success. The Rzhev base is still in German hands. Soviet troops attacking in the Terek area failed, losing many tanks. Soviet offensives in the Don River area were also repelled. Soviet troops launched another unsuccessful attack southeast of Lake Ilmen. The climate on the Eastern Front this year is very different from this time last year. Last November and December, the climate on the Eastern Front was already extremely cold. This year, the climate has been warmer, and it has only recently become cold. The entire front has rain and snow, and the temperature is slightly below zero. The muddy roads on the Eastern Front have a huge impact on transportation, especially for the Soviet army, because German positions often have better transportation infrastructure behind the front lines.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: Sources concerned stated yesterday that the Soviet side lost 3,522 tanks in December. Since the Soviet Union launched its winter offensive, it has only achieved localized small victories, which have no impact on the overall situation on the Eastern Front. The fighting in the northern and southern sectors of the Eastern Front is completely different in nature. The northern section starts from Leningrad, passes through Velikiye Luki, Rzhev, and Kaluga, and extends west to south of Volongaqi, with a fixed front line. The Soviet offensive launched near Rzhev-Toropets at the end of November has now completely stalled, and its goals have not been achieved. The number of Soviet tanks destroyed near Toropets between July 30 and December 31 reached as many as 4,367, giving the area the name "Soviet Tank Cemetery."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Capture Tongcheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: According to a dispatch from a certain base, Japanese troops in the area east of the Dabie Mountains pursued the Chongqing army northward and occupied the Chongqing army stronghold of Tongcheng on the 4th.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Downstream Mopping-Up Operation</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The various units of the Japanese Army in the downstream Yangtze River, echoing the consecutive victories in the northern and southern combat areas, launched a mopping-up operation in the Jiangbei area on New Year's Day. Details are as follows: (1) The mixed troops in the Jiangbei Triangle area have recently been completely suppressed by the expanded operations of the Japanese army. In order to completely reduce them, the attack began on New Year's Day. A certain Japanese army unit launched an attack on approximately 10,000 mixed troops of Li Mingyang and Chen Taiyun entrenched in the southwest of Dongtai, adopting an encirclement formation. On the 1st, they broke into Shagang City in the southwest of Dongtai, and on the 2nd, they swept around Zhoujia Canal. On the 3rd, they annihilated the Shao Huang She Security Third Brigade of approximately 400 people in the southwest of Dongtai. Also, Li Changjiang provided great assistance in this battle. As of the 4th, the battle results were as follows: 428 enemy corpses were abandoned, 275 people were captured, 23 mortars, 130 mortar shells, 5 light machine guns, 141 rifles, 8,055 rifle bullets, and 1,263 hand grenades were seized. (2) The main force of the Chongqing 176th Division in the Tongcheng area north of Anqing gradually moved south and stirred near the Japanese military police line. The Japanese army unit began operations to the north on the afternoon of the 1st and arrived at the east and west of Yuantanpu, north of Anqing, on the morning of the 2nd. After receiving the news, the main force of the Chongqing 176th Division fled towards Tongcheng, so the Japanese army changed into several columns to pursue and break them up. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they pursued and attacked Tongcheng from the front, surrounding approximately 2,000 remnants in Tongcheng from the southeast, west, and three sides, and annihilated them in one fell swoop at dawn on the 4th. At the same time, they suddenly began operations from Gaoshapu in the northwest of Anqing on the 3rd, sweeping the remnants in the vicinity of Qingcaogeme Yuantanpu.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Guilin and Shaoguan</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Nanjing, 5th: The press department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced at 12:10 PM today that a squadron of Japanese Army fighter planes and bombers bombed Guilin yesterday, destroying the facilities of the airfield there. Another squadron of Japanese Army planes attacked Shaoguan (north of Guangzhou) and Lechang (an air base 50 kilometers north of Shaoguan) on the same day. The military facilities in both places were destroyed and set on fire. No enemy planes challenged the attacks, and all Japanese planes returned safely to their original defenses. Furthermore, according to supplementary news from the front lines, only one enemy fighter plane appeared over Guilin, and upon seeing the Japanese planes attacking, immediately fled. There were also two fake airplanes in the airfield, but the Japanese did not bomb them, because they did not want to waste bombs needlessly. After Shaoguan and Lechang were bombed, fires broke out in three places. Both places are key points on the supply route for the Chongqing troops stationed in the area.</p>
<h3>Many Italian Armistice Committee Members Arrested in Djibouti</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tangier, 5th: According to news from Djibouti, the new Governor of French Somaliland, Bayettaire, after taking office, first ordered the arrest of 33 members of the Italian Armistice Committee, who will be sent to British prisoner-of-war camps. He also released those detained by the succeeding authorities for sympathizing with General Tegor. Djibouti held a military parade yesterday to welcome General Gentilhomme, Commissioner of French Madagascar. General Platt, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in East Africa, also participated.</p>

<h3>War in Southeastern Tunisia Intensifies; No Changes in Tripoli Positions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 5th: According to news from North Africa, on the southeastern Tunisian front, the Axis forces took advantage of a slight lull in the rain to launch a counterattack against the Free French forces on the 3rd and 4th. First, they launched a fierce aerial bombardment, followed by an armored force of 40 tanks to attack the Free French positions, expanding their gains. In the north, in the Medjez el Bab area, there was only air combat. Large formations of Allied air fortresses and fighter-bombers attacked the port of La Goulette in the Gulf of Tunis on the 4th and were repelled after a heroic air battle with the Axis air force. The Allied headquarters announced on the same day that they acknowledged that seven air fortresses had been shot down in this battle.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 5th: London received a report from the Allied headquarters in North Africa stating that continuous rain and severe sandstorms in Libya have resulted in no large-scale battles recently. The fighting in Tunisia is intensifying. In the southern sector, a fierce attack on Faid is underway. It is reported that several native workers in the American rear have been executed for refusing to transport supplies for the Allied forces due to negligence.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, 4th: According to recent news from the British and American sides, it is confirmed that the Axis forces are very active in North Africa. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa issued a message stating that the German army launched a fierce attack 80 miles south of the port of Tunis and has been repelled by the American army. Up to now, the Axis forces and the French detachment have only fought in the Garro area, while the American army has now penetrated deep into southern Tunisia. This is the first time the American side has issued this message. However, British tank troops launched a fierce attack on the German positions near Medjez el Bab. There have been no changes in the positions of both sides in the Tripoli area. The British side acknowledged that the British army continued to attack the Axis forces extensively in the Béja area and along the Chabi River.</p>
<h3>British Dispatch Lancashire Regiment to Attack Jirik, But Attack Fails; Captain Bentalbreen and Others Captured; Japanese Defenses in Burma Consolidated</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 5th: The British military action in Burma has failed due to the consolidation of Japanese defenses. However, the Allied powers took this opportunity to publicize that this military action was a large-scale offensive launched by the Allied powers in East Asia, in order to reduce the attention of the Allied powers to the military setbacks on the Eastern Front and the Tunisian Front. On the 13th and 28th, San Francisco radio broadcast that the British army had begun operations in Burma, the Japanese army offered no resistance, and the British army bravely attacked and had now reached 45 kilometers north of Akyab. However, there have been no subsequent announcements. On the 30th, it was stated that there was nothing to report on the progress of the British army's attack in Burma. It can be seen that this contradictory propaganda from the British side is purely a fabrication.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Jirik, 4th: The Burmese Expeditionary Force, in view of the enemy's activity along the border, especially in the India-Burma border area, strengthened its combat posture and took certain measures in the border area of Jirik to avoid unnecessary conflicts with the Indian army. The enemy mistakenly believed that the Japanese army had no resistance and repeatedly dispatched British troops to the front line, attempting to advance south towards Jirik. During the five days from December 27 to 31, the enemy attempted to counterattack in the area on both sides of the Mayu River, which flows into the Bay of Bengal north of Jirik, but was completely crushed by the Japanese army. The attacking troops were the 16th Company of the Lancashire Regiment, consisting of Englishmen, led by Captain Bentalbreen and 19 others, who were captured. Over 60 corpses were abandoned, along with numerous light machine guns, rifles, hand grenades, and bayonets. The enemy's attempt to return to Jirik was like a spring dream. The battle situation in the five days is as follows: In the first counterattack operation, the enemy army attacked the mouth of the Mayu River using twelve abandoned civilian boats from the night of December 27 to the morning of the 28th. This was the 10th Battalion of the Lancashire Regiment, with a force of approximately 400 men. The Japanese army units launched a fierce attack the moment the enemy troops landed, sinking all twelve civilian boats, capturing the company commander and five others. After abandoning 20 corpses, the enemy fled north. The Japanese side suffered one casualty each. In the second attack, the enemy army again attempted a counterattack on the 29th with the remaining force of the 16th Company, but were again subjected to a fierce attack by the Japanese army, and 14 more people were captured, and over 30 corpses and countless light machine guns and rifles were abandoned before fleeing. After the second attack, the enemy launched a third counterattack, with approximately 800 British troops attacking along the north-south Youme Mountains between the Mayu River and the Bay of Bengal. The vanguard of approximately 40 or 50 men crossed the river on the 31st and were annihilated by a sudden attack by the Japanese army units. The enemy retreated to the north. The enemy's ambitions to return to Jirik were completely shattered.</p>

<h3>U.S. Strategy in the Southwest Pacific: Damage Several Times That of Japan, Importance of Strengthening Supply - Translated from the December 27, 1942, issue of the "Dokuritsu Hōchi"</h3>
<p>Argentina, Buenos Aires, 27th - Special Correspondent Furuta reports: Han. Baldwin, a renowned military affairs reporter for the New York Times, who accompanied the U.S. forces in the Southwest Pacific for combat, witnessed the bloody battles between Japan and the U.S. After returning, he emphasized the importance of the war situation in that area and repeatedly issued reports, arousing significant concern among the U.S. government and public. He emphasized that the war situation in the Southwest Pacific has now developed to a crucial stage where it can determine the fate of the entire Pacific theater. At the same time, he stated that the decisive factor for victory or defeat is the supply battle, pointing out the unique characteristics of the operations in that area, and loudly called for supplementing the fatal blows suffered by the U.S. Navy from afar, otherwise, it would not only be detrimental to the U.S. military but also bring about a worrisome crisis for the world's war against the Axis powers. The following is a summary of the main points of his report published in the New York Times:</p>
<p>U.S. Weakness in Distance</p>
<p>Currently, the balance of power in the Pacific can be generally described as Japan and the U.S. each occupying five parts. The western part is undoubtedly under Japanese control, while the eastern Pacific and the waters around Australia and New Zealand are under U.S. control. The new U.S. defense line starts from Nome, extends to Dutch Harbor, Hawaii Island, and then south to Samoa, New Caledonia, and Australia. Its forward line is placed on the line connecting the Andreanov Islands of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Midway Island, Guadalcanal Island, etc. In contrast, Japan's main defense line forms a vast semicircle stretching from the Kuril Islands southward through the Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Thus, on the vast Pacific Ocean, both the Japanese and U.S. armies have to concentrate their extraordinary energy on the issues of distance and supply in order to maintain their long confrontation lines of roughly equal distance. Moreover, in engagements with the enemy, both sides are striving to prevent the other from freely maneuvering their main forces, attempting to create obstacles in terms of distance to impose significant disadvantages. This point is indeed the most notable characteristic of the Japan-U.S. Pacific War. Therefore, both Japan and the U.S. are committed to using a large number of ground troops as garrison forces, a large number of aircraft for combat liaison, and even more naval vessels to escort ships. In this way, the balance of power between the two armies can be maintained. Therefore, the war situation in the Pacific will continue to present a long-term stalemate.</p>
<p>However, due to the development of the war situation in the South Pacific today, the balance of power between Japan and the U.S. is gradually showing signs of breaking. The left flank of the U.S. Pacific defense line is relatively weak, which is the sea area from Australia to the Southwest Pacific. In order to strengthen this weakness and prevent the threat from Japan, the U.S. military dared to launch an attack in the Solomon Sea area and advanced into Guadalcanal Island. If the U.S. military can secure a solid forward operating base here, then the left flank of the U.S. defense line in the Pacific can be expected to have some degree of stability. Therefore, the battle of the Solomon Islands, which initially began mainly with a defensive intent, gradually turned into a battle involving a large number of warships and aircraft. Now, the battle has developed into a major decisive battle that dominates the balance of power in the Pacific. Even in this vast Pacific Ocean, the struggle for an island or a village itself has little significance, but the reason why the Japanese and U.S. armies do not hesitate to inflict significant damage on their warships and aircraft is that the result has a huge impact on the power relationship between the two armies throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>Important Factors in Determining Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of the Solomon Sea battle lies in the fact that, through this battle, both Japan and the U.S. can fully contain the overall operations of their enemy, that is, it has the effect of drawing the combat power of both armies to one point. It is important to pay special attention to the fact that the Japanese and U.S. armies share the advantages and disadvantages in combat in that area. In terms of the Navy alone, Japan's lines of communication for its combat units are shorter than those of the U.S., so it can maintain its naval superiority. However, in terms of supply lines, because it is far from its home country, the difficulties it encounters in supplying ships, personnel, aircraft, etc., are the same as those encountered by the U.S. Therefore, one of the important factors in determining victory or defeat can be said to lie in the superiority or inferiority of Japan and the U.S. in terms of transportation capacity, tonnage of ships, and ability to mobilize personnel. In addition, the U.S. has the advantage of fighting in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, while Japan only has the benefit of fighting in one sea. However, if the U.S. does not intend to launch an attack from this direction further north on the occupied islands, it will inevitably suffer the same significant dangers and the same significant damage. This is an inevitable principle.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the U.S. military's attack in the Solomon Sea area is by no means as simple an operation as initially imagined; moreover, its operational goals are not limited to the passive meaning of strengthening the left flank of the Pacific defense line. Even judging from the announcements of the Japanese and U.S. authorities, it can be known that the decisive battle of the Solomon Islands is precisely a major decisive battle of the full force of both sides' naval and air forces, and will become even larger in scale in the future. Will the U.S. military concentrate its forces even more in this area? Or will it suffer the pain of a decisive defeat? It is now in a position where it has no choice but to choose between the two. What is being wagered on the Solomon Islands is not so much the nearby islands as the fleets of the Japanese and U.S. navies, that is, the domination of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous battles since this summer, the losses suffered by both armies have indeed been enormous. Regardless of how the U.S. authorities conceal the facts, the blows suffered by the U.S. Navy are significantly several times to even tens of times greater than those of Japan. Since the initial battles, the U.S. Navy has been hit, and with the major blows in that area, if it is not quickly replenished, it is a fatal threat to the U.S. The U.S. is now at a time when its superior productivity is showing results, but in any case, the outcome of the battle in the Solomon Islands depends on the damage to the air force and the Navy, which cooperate closely with the Navy. The result will not only affect the operations throughout the Pacific, but also have a significant impact on the world war situation. This must be remembered. (Translated by Ding)</p>

<h3>Household Rice: Quantity to Be Increased Soon, Each Rice Coupon Can Redeem Two Sheng of Rice</h3>
<p>The increased allocation of household rice, eagerly awaited by residents of the two concessions, is expected to be initially realized starting from the next period, with an increase of half a sheng. In other words, each rice purchase certificate can be used to purchase two sheng of rice. As for the quantity of flour, after being increased by four ounces this period, there is also hope for a discretionary increase in the next period.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Payment to Claim Purchase Orders</p>
<p>According to a Ta Tung Press reporter's inquiry, the Public Concession rice merchants have already paid the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food and Flour Allocation Office yesterday, and the Allocation Office will issue the purchase orders to the Rice Merchant Association. The Rice Merchant Association can then issue the purchase orders to each rice merchant today.</p>
<p>Next Period's Ration Increased to Two Sheng</p>
<p>The Public Concession rice merchants' orders to the Rice Merchant Association have officially implemented the increase in the quantity allocated, and the rice ration granted to each citizen will also be increased to a total of two sheng, consisting of one sheng of red rice, half a sheng of white rice, and an additional half a catty of broken rice. As for flour, after being increased by four taels this period, there is also hope for a discretionary increase in the next period.</p>
<h3>Advisor Ishiwatari Passes Through Shanghai to Beijing</h3>
<p>Shōtarō Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, previously returned to Japan to liaise with various government departments. Now that his official duties have been completed, he arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and took the train back to Beijing at 9:20 p.m. that evening to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Promoting Sino-Japanese Culture: Departing Words from Section Chief Ito</h3>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch from Domei News Agency: Ito, the newly appointed Cultural Section Chief of the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing, went to Nanjing this morning to assume his post. He issued departing words to Domei News Agency, stating that Japan's cultural professionals in China, previously led by Azabu and the Asia Academy, have now been transferred to the Greater East Asia Ministry. In the future, they will intensify their efforts to complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The method to be adopted is to cooperate between the Japanese Embassy and the National Government in Nanjing, using various cultural undertakings to connect the hearts of the Chinese people. However, there are many difficulties in cultural undertakings. Japan should first dispatch a large number of teachers to schools throughout China, and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association should establish branches in various places to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Commendation for Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama: Imperial Award</h3>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch from Domei News Agency: The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department disclosed this afternoon that, recently, on the recommendation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Italian Emperor has awarded the rank of officer in the Italian Imperial Army to Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the former spokesman of the Army Press Department here, to commend him for his sincere efforts in promoting cooperation and friendship between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Italy.

<h3>Regular Traffic Between Jinhua and Xiaoshan: Qiantang River Bridge to Be Repaired by the End of March</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which connects Jinhua and Hangzhou, was suspended after the Incident. In particular, the Qiantang River Bridge, which cost a huge amount of money, was blown up just as it was completed. At the end of May last year, the Japanese army reorganized the railway line for military purposes. By December 20 last year, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line was officially handed over from the military's management to the Central China Railway Company for business operations. It is now learned that the company has already scheduled the section from Jinhua to the Xiaoshan riverside to be open to traffic from April 1, and the Qiantang River Bridge will also begin to be repaired by the end of March. After that, direct trains will run between Shanghai and Jinhua, and in addition to selling passenger tickets, goods will also be accepted. Trade between Shanghai and various parts of eastern Zhejiang is expected to improve.</p>
<h3>German Chargé d'Affaires Karl Comes: Expresses Feelings, Determined to Strengthen Sino-German Relations, Feels a Great Responsibility, Hopes for Help from Allied Nations</h3>
<p>The newly appointed German Chargé d'Affaires to China, Dr. Karl, arrived at the German Consulate General on the morning of the 5th to assume his post and expressed his feelings as follows: "I served in Japan for two years. During that time, I witnessed the rapid development of the world situation. The Greater East Asia War broke out in Tokyo, and the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy formed an alliance. Although my time in Japan was short, I saw and heard a lot. I am grateful for the sincere friendship given to me by the Japanese people, which allowed my work to proceed smoothly. I am also deeply grateful to see Japan's efforts in the front and rear to carry out the great war."</p>
<p>"This time, my country's government has appointed me as Chargé d'Affaires and sent me to the Republic of China. I feel a great responsibility and hope that friends from allied countries will give me advice and assistance from time to time to make up for my shortcomings. I am very interested in the situation in China. If I can further deepen Sino-German relations this time, I will be very fortunate. Sino-German relations have a long history based on mutual respect. After I take office, I will cooperate with the National Government to work together to achieve the final victory of the great war."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Sub-Committee Political Work Group: Work Situation</h3>
<p>The third group of the Shanghai Qingxiang Sub-Committee Political Work Group is responsible for intelligence reporting. Since the start of the Qingxiang campaign, it has appointed intelligence officers to be distributed in various places to form an intelligence network. At the same time, it has also set up public secret reporting boxes in various towns to facilitate public reporting. In addition, the group often sends specialists to various places to conduct secret investigations and promptly reports various intelligence reports to the Sub-Committee's Director Chen and various relevant agencies for verification and handling. For five months, the work has been quite active.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange for Flour Products: Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the various flour product stores in the two concessions have still been using a currency exchange system and have not implemented the new system of flour exchange for flour products. It is also learned that the prices of various flour products have already risen. For example, the price of a pancake has increased from two cents to three cents, and the price of fried dough sticks has increased from three cents to four cents.</p>
<h3>Cigarette and Daily Necessities Market to Resume Within the Week</h3>
<p>Since its automatic closure, there has been news of preparations to resume the Shanghai Cigarette and Daily Necessities Association market at the end of last year.

A total of 300 fellow traders have been registered in the city, and each must pay a market fee of 200 yuan per month. In the future, after the market opens, traders will be admitted for trading with the admission certificates issued by the Association. Non-industry personnel and speculative merchants are excluded. As of today, most of the registered traders have paid the market fee.</p>
<h3>British and American僑民 Associations: Registration of Women and Children Limited to Those Who Were Not Nationals Before Marriage, Children Under Thirteen Must Also Register</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Association recently issued a notice stating, "Under the order of the Japanese General Administration Office, wives of British people who were not British nationals before marriage must register their names, as well as the names of their children under the age of thirteen, with this Association at No. 243 Jiangxi Road, the British Church, on the specified date and time.

<h3>Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (6) Translated from the "Dōmei Jūnpō" late November, Year 31</h3>
<p>First Section: Mining Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Keiichi Isaka—Director of the Tokyo Office, Government-General of Korea</p>
<p>From the perspective of Korea's mission as a supply base for the continent and the integration of the mainland and Korea, it is now necessary to redouble efforts to utilize Korea's abundant resources and labor to actively develop them. We hope for assistance from all quarters in this regard.</p>
<p>Mr. Tane'o Kobayashi—President of Kobayashi Mining &amp; Development</p>
<p>Korea is the second-largest producer of tungsten and gold after China and Burma, accounting for about 90% of Japan's total production. The urgent development of Korea's tungsten and gold mining industry, to break free from the dependence on overseas markets, is an urgent issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Hideei Tsuda, Chairman of the Mining Control Association</p>
<p>(1) Copper: It is regrettable that the copper resources within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be said to be abundant enough to meet current needs. The production from Manchuria and China is not as high as expected. Even with the development of new copper mines in the Philippines, such as in Leyte and Lapu-Lapu, the increased demand is still not met. As a result, there is no other way but to expect increased production from within our country. At the same time, it is necessary to adjust consumption and rigorously implement the use of substitute metals.</p>
<p>(2) Lead: Similar to copper, we hope for a rapid increase in production in the future. If development in Burma can proceed as expected in the future, the demand can be largely met.</p>
<p>(3) Zinc: Within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, production in Annam, Burma, etc., if realized as expected, will be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>(4) Manganese: Manganese, essential for steelmaking, is produced in considerable quantities in the Philippines, the East Indies, Malaya, Annam, etc., in addition to Japan. However, it is still insufficient for current demand. Therefore, the active development of Philippine manganese deposits has become an urgent priority.</p>
<p>(5) Nickel: As a raw material for special steel, demand has suddenly increased recently. Within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippines, New Caledonia, etc., all have production. The Philippines boasts the world's only nickel deposit, and annual production of over ○○ kilowatts can be expected.</p>
<p>(6) Nickel: Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the use of the Sulawesi nickel mine became possible. While large-scale development is what we must expect, at the same time, how to handle the large quantities of low-grade ore is a problem. Therefore, we strongly hope that a smelter can be established locally for sorting.</p>
<p>(7) Tin: The tin production within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, including Malaya, the East Indies (Bangka, Billiton), and Annam, accounts for approximately 70% to 80% of the world's total production. Like rubber, it is one of the surplus materials.</p>
<p>(8) Gold: In response to measures to increase production of copper, lead, and zinc, gold production projects in Japan and various regions of Greater East Asia must be reorganized.</p>
<p>(9) Bauxite: As a raw material for aluminum, bauxite is produced in large quantities in various regions of the East Indies, such as Bintan Island and the Riau Islands, and in Malaya's Johore. Mining is easy, and the quality is excellent, sufficient to meet current needs with a surplus. However, in the future, if demand increases further as a substitute for copper, it will be necessary to further expand mining capacity.</p>
<p>(10) Phosphate Rock: With the acquisition of Christmas Island, Nauru, and Ocean Island, known as the world's richest phosphate mines, under Japanese rule, it can be said that a century-long plan has been completed. What is expected first and foremost is the production of ○○ million tons of phosphate rock from Christmas Island.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market opened on a positive note, with the situation shifting from firm to weak before stabilizing. This was due to the continued tightness of the money market. Despite various favorable rumors and the activity of new and old investors, they were all offset by sellers seeking cash. Furthermore, stock companies felt their appetite was already satiated, and many were offering stocks for sale. In particular, the two new stocks, New Pharmaceutical Industry and Minyi, which had recently undergone capital increases with premium subscriptions, had both fallen below the premium price. Minyi (premium of 65 yuan) fell to 64 yuan, a significant decrease of 6 yuan compared to the pre-holiday price on the 24th (last Thursday). New Asia (premium of 27.5 yuan) fell to 26 yuan, a decrease of 1.75 yuan. Xinyi was the only one to see an increase of 2.5 yuan. Great China Match was traded at 350 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco was down 1.5 yuan. Public utilities were weak and listless, with Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity falling to 60 yuan and Chinese Electric Power to 41 yuan, both down 2.5 yuan. Cultural stocks showed mixed movements, with Commercial Press seeing buyer activity, up 7.5 yuan. World rose by 1 yuan, while Chung Hwa fell to 165 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On was down 3.5 yuan, National Goods down 0.25 yuan, and Sincere remained unchanged. Wing On Textile's new stock price fell from 380 yuan to 362.5 yuan, a final decrease of 7.5 yuan. Small denomination stock Daguanming Weaving fell to 10.25 yuan, while the rest remained stable. Financial stocks saw few buyers, food stocks were stable, and trading was sparse.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Slightly Active, Market Sentiment Weak</h3>
<p>The government bond market and trading were slightly active in yesterday's unofficial market. However, their prices and volume did not show a sudden surge after the four-day New Year's holiday for banks. On the contrary, prices were weaker than before the holiday, and trading was even scarcer. Furthermore, the four types of bonds, A, B, D, and E, were completely ignored. Later, there were some transactions of 5,000 to 10,000 units of types A, D, and E. Type B suddenly saw no transactions at all. Generally, type A traded at 2.5 yuan, type D at 0.08 yuan, and type E at 1.5 yuan. Only type C saw more trading, but because all were spot transactions, the volume was only several tens of thousands. Prices traded as high as 3.2 yuan and as low as 2.9 yuan, with minimal fluctuations. The final market price was only 3 yuan. Due to the regulatory environment, it is feared that there will be no improvement in the short term.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Raised</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed exchange rate for gold jewelry in the city's silver shops was initially 3,000 yuan per tael. Around 1 p.m., it rose again by 50 yuan to 3,050 yuan, a total increase of 100 yuan compared to before the holiday (31st). (Purchases were reduced by about 300 yuan). Inter-dealer transactions were sparse. Morning quotations rose to 2,760 yuan, up 80 yuan. Later, amid buying pressure, quotations rose to as high as 2,870 yuan, but it was still difficult to obtain. This was a rise of 190 yuan compared to last Thursday (31st), with a difference of 110 yuan on the same day. Transactions were thin, and the market was even tighter at the end. The listed price for first-grade silver ornaments remained at 16 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer prices at 16.79 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 0.17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Military Scrip Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, military scrip weakened. Inter-dealer trading prices had fallen to 5.55 yuan, with sellers offering at 5.52 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money shops and bank counters were also lower, at 5.555 yuan and 5.545 yuan, respectively. The Joint Reserve Bank notes remained unchanged, with operators selling at 3.85 yuan and buying at 3.80 yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>Checking the Balance of Out-of-Town Transactions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Provisional Joint Association, in order to understand the status of balances between member banks and their head offices, branches, and correspondent banks outside the Shanghai area, announced that it had sent circulars to all banks yesterday requesting them to report the balance as of the end of December last year. The scope of the area included North China, Central China, South China, and the interior of Chongqing, to be submitted to the Association by the 10th of this month, it was said.</p>
<h3>At the Height of Winter, Sales of North-South Goods Are Active</h3>
<p>Market Prices Mostly Rising, Few Falling</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year has passed, and the Lunar New Year is approaching. The market prices of various goods in the market have been rising frequently, reaching their peaks. Occasional small rises and falls are due to the extremely tight silver market. However, there is still no hope for a large drop in the underlying market.</p>
<p>(Red and Black Dates): Because market prices had once weakened, they were subsequently affected by the reduction in remittances, and production prices rose again, now returning to their original state. First-grade Tianjin red dates are opening at 650 yuan, top-grade dates at 770 yuan, King red dates at 750 yuan, and extra-large King red dates at 800 yuan. Cangzhou red dates are falling by 20 to 30 yuan per grade. Provincial red dates are between 350 yuan and 360 yuan, and long red dates are 300 yuan.</p>
<p>(Dried Vegetables): Xuzhou dried vegetables are opening at 550 yuan, Suqian dried vegetables at 580 yuan, Daxing dried vegetables at 650 yuan, and Dingzhuang dried vegetables at 700 yuan.</p>
<p>(Melon Seeds): Mingguang seeds are 600 yuan, Raozhou seeds are 600 yuan, Muying seeds are 650 yuan, Jizhong seeds are 720 yuan to 730 yuan, Jikui seeds are 800 yuan, and sunflower seeds are 400 yuan.</p>
<p>(Persimmon Cakes): There is a severe shortage and dramatic price increase, due to the Gregorian New Year, transportation agencies have been closed, and goods are not being replenished.</p>
<p>(Noodles): Winter sales have begun. Qingdao noodles are priced at 950 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and Longkou noodles are 1,150 yuan to 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>(Black Fungus): Mailbag fungus is 3,300 yuan to 3,500 yuan, Chung-fu fungus is 5,200 yuan, and Gao-fu fungus is 5,800 yuan.</p>
<p>(Southern Gorgon Fruit): Due to this year's poor harvest, both arrivals and inventory are lacking, and the market is very tight. Therefore, refrigerated goods without wormholes can be sold as new, and prices have been raised. Yesterday, the market sold at 1,300 yuan, up about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(Longan Pulp): Upper-grade sources have been transported, and trading is tight but easing, with day traders also releasing goods from time to time, making it increasingly difficult to rise. Yesterday, several thousand tins were offered at 1,500 yuan. Taiwan longan pulp is 1,300 yuan, Hainan longan pulp is 1,550 yuan, Guangzhou longan pulp is 1,650 yuan, and Shima sun-dried longan pulp is 1,700 to 1,750 yuan.</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>— Pan Tongyun</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank has been established for two years. These two years have coincided with a period of rapid global change and the spread of war. However, the bank has been able to move forward in an orderly manner during this difficult period. In terms of business, the figures for deposits, loans, remittances, and issuance all show significant achievements. In various regions, it has selectively established branches and offices. Currently, there is one branch, six sub-branches, and seventeen offices.</p>
<p>The development of the bank can be divided into two stages, with the Greater East Asia War serving as a clear dividing line. The first stage was from the establishment of the bank to December 7 of the same year, during which the bank focused on building up its reserves. The second stage is from December 8 of the 30th year to the present, during which the bank implemented its financial policies. The financial measures that have already been implemented are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) Currency Reform: The exchange coupons issued by the bank were originally used at par with the old legal tender. This link was broken on March 31 of last year, and the exchange rate between the new and old legal tender was set at 77 to 100. However, this did not mean that the circulation of the old legal tender was prohibited. Until mid-May, the ratio between the new and old legal tender changed daily. It was changed to 74 on the 20th, 71 on the 21st, 66 on the 22nd, 60 on the 23rd, 53 on the 25th, and 50 on the 26th. At that time, the financial market was unstable. On the 27th, the Ministry of Finance ordered that the bank's exchange coupons be officially designated as the unified currency and that the legal tender status of the old currency in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, be abolished. On June 1, the Ministry of Finance, together with the bank, organized the Old Currency Consolidation Committee. On June 8, the recall of the old currency began, lasting for a month. 1.12 billion yuan of old currency was recalled. On November 1, the final recall of the old currency was carried out again, ending at the end of November. By this point, the bank's work on currency reform had achieved initial success.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office: In order to regulate the economy and stabilize finance, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" on August 20 of last year. 8 articles. The bank was specially entrusted to establish the Financial Affairs Inspection Office, with full authority to handle it. On October 19, the Inspection Office was officially established. On October 30, financial institutions deposited their reserve funds with the bank in accordance with the prescribed methods. (1) More than 5% of time deposits and special current deposits. (2) More than 10% of current deposits. The management of financial institutions was thus realized.</p>
<p>(3) Assisting in the Resumption of Business of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications: The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications officially resumed business on September 1. In addition to providing funds, the bank will also provide assistance to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications when they need funds for their business operations in the future. This will further consolidate the foundation of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications.</p>

<h3>Warm Friendship</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The greatest happiness in life is to have a close friend. Warm friendship can inspire a promising career. Although there are "people" all around, how many of these people can be considered true confidants?</p>
<p>A true friend is someone who can truly understand you, without any element of compulsion or exploitation. Mere perfunctory behavior and self-interest cannot cultivate pure friendship. In addition to these conditions, it is also necessary to have compatible personalities and shared interests.</p>
<p>The "childhood sweethearts" and "innocent playmates" of childhood are nothing more than innocent unions. Fighting and scolding are games, liking and disliking are habitual.</p>
<p>Once you enter society, there are too many and too few confidants. Too many because everyone around you is smiling. If you are too honest, you will mistakenly make many "confidants" and when you fail or are frustrated, some smiling faces turn into ugly faces, some smiling faces turn into crying faces, and all your confidants become enemies. So why too few? If you are smarter than them, you won't be fooled, and you will feel that there are too few friends you can make.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying: "Friends in elementary school will all be forgotten innocently, friends in college have been infiltrated by the social courtesies and toxins of exploitation, only friends from high school can become your confidants."</p>
<p>This statement is probably correct. In high school, you don't understand the truth of society at all, and you are not controlled by the magic of money, so it is very possible to have friends with compatible personalities, studying together. At this time, there is no habit of courtesy, but the innocence and purity of elementary school still exist and have not disappeared, plus there is already a certain amount of knowledge and it is not just a mischievous friendship. In this environment, a true friendship can be cultivated. Many confidants who support each other in their careers are mostly friends from high school. This is a proven fact.</p>
<p>When you need a confidant to whom you can tell your innermost thoughts, you must choose carefully. This friendship can affect a person's life. If you want to survive in society, you must have the ability to examine the good and bad of the people around you.</p>
<h3>A Record of the 11th Performance of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Last Sunday (January 3), the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed its 11th concert at the Lyceum Theatre. The program included Fumoto's "Excerpts," Debussy's "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun," "Petite Suite," and Franck's "Symphony in D minor." Among them, Debussy's and Franck's works are worth listening to.</p>
<p>Debussy, as everyone knows, is a master of French impressionism. Influenced by the impressionism in painting and the symbolism in poetry and literature at the time, he began to liberate French music from the atmosphere of German romanticism and neo-romanticism. He abandoned the bright and intense colors of the past, and excelled in lightness and simplicity. Taking the "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun" as an example, how enchanting is his expression of the hazy, sleepy colors of a summer afternoon. The "Petite Suite" is divided into four movements, each with its own characteristics. The style of the ballads and the tunes of the ancient festival songs are especially what I love.</p>
<p>Franck tends to be more classical. The mysterious religious color is one of his characteristics. It is said that the only symphony he composed contains solemn and sacred elements, and it is quite moving to listen to.</p>
<p>Looking at the preview in the program, next Sunday (January 10) there will be programs by Beethoven, Respighi, Paganini, Rossini, etc., which will probably be even more exciting than the last time. Music lovers may wish to try it. The location is still at the Lyceum.</p>
<h3>A Living Sample</h3>
<p>— Hong Li</p>
<p>As long as you walk around Shanghai, no matter where you go, you can see samples in the glass display windows of the stores. These samples come in all kinds, and vary depending on the business of each store. They attract customers with their beautiful and unique poses, showing their painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>Especially these past two days, all the major companies and major stores have been vying with each other to display all kinds of samples, making some greedy people dizzy. Indeed, it is too easy to attract people. The snow-white and tall model is wearing the latest and most beautiful coat, and wearing a pair of leather gloves, standing there gracefully, how can one not envy it? It is no wonder that rich people who like to be modern come to put on a heavy fur coat worth 10,000 yuan and wear a pair of valuable and beautiful gloves. This extravagant dress makes them secretly pleased in their hearts!</p>
<p>However, those who have no money can only look forward to it but cannot reach it. Although they want to eat their fill and wear warm clothes, what they lack is money. These clothes can only be bought by the rich, or enjoyed by ignorant models. Whenever I see the "wooden man" in the display window, dressed as if "full of vigor," while the naked and destitute people sleeping outside the display window are freezing in the roaring north wind.</p>
<p>The difference between people and models lies in the difference in nerve perception. Living people have nerves, so they have perception. Conversely, people with numb nerves are just stupid wooden chickens! If these rich people who wear heavy fur coats and eat lamb have no compassion for a group of people who are freezing and starving to death, aren't their nerves numb? At least, aren't their nerves malfunctioning? Aren't they just like the models in the display window? Seeing them, a good-looking defecation machine, shaking happily on the road, but in reality, it is just a living sample.</p>
<h3>Huxley on the Problem of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Famous Scientists</h3>
<p>— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, when I was still a child, I read Hamilton's article on unconditional states. From then until now, the speculation of ontology, in my eyes, is just nonsense. Mansel continued Hamilton's words in the Orthodox direction. At this time, I can't help but say that what he reminds me of is nothing else but the person in Hogarth's picture who sawed off the branch of the tree he was sitting on. But this is just by the way.</p>
<p>I cannot conceive of my personality as something separate from the phenomenon of my life. When I want to form a concept, I find that, as Coleridge said, I am only substantiating a word. If I thought, like Fichte, that the universe was nothing but a manifestation of my personality, it would not change anything. Now I am neither more insistent nor more uninsistent than before.</p>
<p>The infinite difference between myself and beasts cannot change this situation. I don't know if there is anything that exists after beasts die. I don't know even more if the infinite difference between us and them will not be rewarded by their continued existence and my apparent extinction after death, just like the bulb of an annual plant is alive, while the flowers it puts forth have already died.</p>
<p>Of course, it is very clear that the ambiguous arguments of a clever person will find all kinds of similar things for his dreams. If you tell me that human aspirations—even my highest aspirations—lead me to the doctrine of immortality, it is useless to me. From the beginning, I have hated the fact of such aspirations. But even if this were indeed the case, it would not be of any use. Is this just alarmist talk? To make me believe something I like?</p>
<p>Science has taught me the opposite lesson. She warns me to be careful when I adopt the views that arise with prejudice, and to obtain more powerful evidence for this belief than for the beliefs I previously opposed.</p>
<p>My duty is to teach my aspirations to conform to the facts, not to make the facts conform to my aspirations.</p>
<p>What science has taught me in the highest and strongest attitude seems to be a great truth, which is contained in the Christian concept of complete submission to God's will. Sit down like a child in the face of facts, be prepared to abandon every preconceived idea, and humbly follow nature to any abyss, otherwise you will learn nothing. I have taken this risk willingly, and I am now only beginning to learn psychological satisfaction and peace.</p>
<p>However, there are other arguments that contribute to the doctrine of human immortality. In my opinion, these arguments are not only seductive but also harmful. One idea says that the moral government of the world would not be complete without a system of rewards and punishments in the afterlife. Another idea is that such a system is indispensable to practical morality. I believe that these two dogmatic teachings are very harmful lies. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Perhaps this is right. He remembers the extreme embarrassment of his first time managing preparatory lessons, a sunset in September, as if it had been more than half a century ago; the large classroom was full of strong barbarians, ready to take him as legitimate prey and pounce on him. He was young, with a delicate face, a high collar, and a side-whiskered chin (the strange appearance that people were familiar with at that time), completely at the mercy of those five hundred wanton villains. For them, insulting new teachers was their specialty, their most interesting pastime, and also a traditional custom. If you look at them one by one, they are all considered good little beggars, but when they become a mob, they are cruel and unreasonable. As soon as he went to the lecture hall and stood by the writing desk, there was a moment of silence; he wanted to hide his nervousness and deliberately frowned; the long grandfather clock ticked behind him, and the ink and paint both gave off a smell; the blood-red sun, in pieces, shone obliquely through the stained glass windows. Someone dropped a cover plate on the table. Soon, he had to surprise people; he had to show that he had no idiotic intentions. "You, in the fifth row—you, with the red hair—what's your name?" "Colley, sir." "Very well, Colley, you will copy one hundred lines." From then on, there was no more trouble. He had won the first battle.</p>
<p>Years later, Colley was a member of the London County Council, a baronet, and held various other positions. At that time, he sent his son (also with red hair) to Brookfield. Chips wanted to say: "Colley, your father was the first person I punished when I first came here twenty-five years ago. He deserved it at the time, and now you deserve it too." How they all laughed! Sir Richard's son talked about this in his letter home on Sunday, and how Sir Richard also laughed!</p>
<p>Many years after this incident, there was even a better joke. Because another Colley had just arrived—the grandson of the first Colley. Chips would say the following words again, saying them with a series of small "uh-hum—um," as if keeping time, which he already had this habit at this time; "Colley, you are—uh-hum—an excellent example—uh-hum—of hereditary example. I remember your grandfather—uh-hum—he never understood Ablative Absolute. Your grandfather was an idiot. Your father was too—uh-hum—I remember him—he often sat far away at that table by the wall—he wasn't any better either. But I really believe—my dear Colley—that you are—uh-hum—the biggest fool of this bunch! Roaring laughter. (3)</p>

<h3>Tongde Middle School - Joint Celebration for Frugality and Scholarship Assistance</h3>
<p>(Above omitted) At that time, when all goods were expensive and life was hard, there were countless ambitious young people in Shanghai who were unable to pursue their studies. Our classmates felt deeply sympathetic, but our abilities were limited. Now, we are donating the entire sum of one hundred national currency units originally intended for the tea and refreshments expenses of the trade association to your newspaper's scholarship fund, in order to provide some relief. We know it is but a drop in the bucket, and of little practical help, but it is merely a small token of our united hearts.</p>
