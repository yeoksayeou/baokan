<p>社評</p>
<h3>參戰·建國與興業</h3>
<p>參戰二個多月，除了精神上以外，對於盟國日本，似乎沒有什麼有力的協助，我們應該感覺慚愧。但是參戰後中日當局所表現的事實，百年來所求之不得的，如中日協定所規定的中國獨立自由的保障，現在可說已開始透露出曙光了。在國民政府日漸踏上健全的過程中，民間事業似乎也有了乘此振興的希望，所以參戰。建國與興業之相互關係，亦漸爲一般人所了解。不過，在這裏也有不能不特別指出的，就是目前的建設，無論是國家的或私人的，都不能不首先顧到參戰的需要，以及對參戰是否有利；反乎此者，自然一切都是徒勞而已。所以在參戰期內的建國與興業，當然有其限制和特點。</p>
<p>我們今日言建國，在事實上雖有賴於盟邦日本的善意協助，如資本，技術和機器的供給。然就一般意義言，則完成建國大業之責任，原由我們自由擔負起來，而且要在今日立即準備起來，不能有絲毫假借，也不許有片刻懈怠。不必諱言的，我國今日工業落後，交通不便，資本缺乏，技術幼稚，以言建國大業，眞是百廢待舉，頭緒萬千；然而正惟如此，我們必須有一個周密的全盤的計劃，分別緩急輕重，預定步驟，切實推進。凡重者急者，全力舉　，限期　成，輕者緩者，暫不置論，徐圖興建。過去的情形，因爲求治心切，往往擬辦之事太多，人財俱感不足，所以有些事業項目，未能如期完成，或因人才不够，中途　遇頓挫。今後便須痛下決心改變作風，沒有充足的經費不辦，沒有　當人材的不　，其必須舉　的，則應以工作競賽之方法，謹嚴不苟之精神，期其達成；尤必期其精確，而一掃務求多辦，彼此爭辦，祇裝門面，不重成續之積習。庶幾各種事業可以確實完成，中央財政可免嚴重壓力，此其一。</p>
<p>我們言建國大業，就字面來看，似乎所有關係國家前途大計之事，完全應由政府舉辦；而民間之所經營，便與建國無干，自亦非民間之力所能期其完成。但實際上，除了若干特殊部門須完全由政府負責規劃之外，有許多事業均賴民問協力推進。我們希望政府設一設計和指導機構，並使企業界可以運用盟邦貸　及經過正式證券市塲，以吸收游資，而協助政府，興辦工業。政府如有了這種設計和指導的機構，現在就可以將應辦可辦之各種事業，分類分地，詳確規定、公吿國民，指導投資，予民間企業以切實之助力。如此有資財者，知所趨向，游資作祟之程度可以相當减輕，民營工業漸次發達，國民經濟上之進步可以立待，此其二。</p>
<p>在經濟範圍以內，建國與興業，實爲一事之兩面，政府興辦事業是建國，人民興辦事業又何嘗不是建國？在參戰中，人人應爲戰士，在建國大業上，人人可爭首功。依據這種觀念，我們認爲有資財者要有遠大的眼光，高超的抱負，不急近功，不圖暴利，規劃企業，福國利民，在目前，除事業上必要運用財力以外，儘量儲蓄，以備戰後之需，在目前减少法幣之流通，固於國家裨益不少，在將來擴展本身的事業，尤爲至善無上之計，此其三。</p>
<p>總之，參戰是爲爭取國家獨立自由，萬分重要，然必須建國成功，始能永保獨立自由，所以建國與興業，也萬分重要。切願上下各自振奮，努力本位工作，實事求是，共竟全功。</p>

<h3>美國對蘇政策的動搖</h3>
<p>由德蘇戰事的過程中，美國見到了蘇聯的實力出於意料之外的强剏。結果，美國方面的對蘇政策，應從新觀點出發的議論，甚囂塵上。於是美國駐蘇大使史丹萊首先發表了非難蘇聯當局「不使民衆獲悉美國對蘇援助的詳情」的聲明。最爲微妙者，因史丹萊的聲明而大爲驚慌者，不是被非難的蘇聯政府，却反而是美國朝野自身。</p>
<p>美國援助蘇聯，這是事實。二月下旬，據美國衆議院外交委員會所發表的審議報告書，美國自一九四一年十一月，對蘇軍備租借法案適用以來，迄去年末爲止，供給蘇聯的物資達十五億三千二百萬美元。其中包括飛機五千六百架，戰車六千二百輛。美國片面發表的上述數字，是否正確，不得而知；縱令屬實，然上述物資，是否能完全到達蘇聯，亦爲疑問。但無論如何，我們總得承認美國確曾供給蘇聯相當數量的軍需品。上述的供給量，與美國的對英　助比較起來，不過三分之一弱，但比美國的對蔣援助，則約有十倍。史丹萊說「蘇聯斷不是僅用自力抗戰」的話，並不是沒有理由的胡說。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯也有蘇聯的說法。蘇聯在對德戰爭上所付的龐大犧牲，以視美國的對蘇援助，實在微乎其微。「英美軍對法屬北菲的侵略戰事，不認爲就是第二戰綫。英美以國運爲賭而與蘇聯結成共同戰綫，假使眞有援助蘇聯的決心，英美尙應覺悟須付出重大的犧牲，毅然在西部歐洲開闢强大的第二戰綫」—蘇聯的看法不是這樣嗎？蘇聯爲了防衛英美，而提供了蘇聯的人的資源，美國在足以保持本國的安全之範圍內，供給蘇聯必要的物資。一旦戰而獲勝，則美國得以確保最强的發言權，羅斯福這一損人利己的企圖，蘇聯不會漠然無知的。</p>
<p>史丹萊之流的故意的聲明，在蘇聯獨自的立塲，很容易引起對美國發生反感態度的危險。此所以美國以至於英國因史丹萊的失言而極見狼狽。蘇聯假使脫離英美陣營，則英美即將遭遇空前的危機，這是鐵一般的事實。史丹萊對蘇聯政府嬉卉攻擊的言辭時，美國副總統華萊斯一面便聲稱「勿與蘇聯內鬨」，今更牽制國內的蘇聯恐怖論者，對蘇表示媚態。可是，蘇聯之强剏的實力之再認識，同時，美國對蘇警戒的氣氛，却顯見濃厚起來。評論家特羅希·湯姆生警吿國民「蘇聯的勝利即世界的赤化之謂。」美國的「蘇聯通」都倫泰指摘斯太林的現實主義，警吿美國的依存蘇聯應有限度。紐約時報稱，蘇聯的要求應予抑制，這不過是幾個例子而已。</p>
<p>蘇聯在戰後的史趨强大，含有赤化歐洲的意義，同時更恐怕在西亞與蘇聯發生直接的利害衡突，這在美國看來，自然是很討厭的事態，然而要渡過目前的危局，則又不能不與蘇聯繼續合作。這柿顧此失彼的情况，使美國以至於英國左右爲難，細於應付。</p>
<p>然而盎格魯撒克遜人究竟是老奸巨猾的民族，因爲斯太林輕易不受英美的誘惑，爲欲和斯太林親自接觸，或許故意授意史丹萊在平地引起波瀾。於是遂有對蘇成立諒解之說的傳聞，而羅斯福訪蘇傳說的由來，或即起因於此，亦未可知。耶使如此，羅斯福的訪蘇和武器的供給，也未見得就能使英美與蘇聯之間的隔閡，有急轉直下的趨勢。蘇聯堅決地要求英美應有巨大的犧牲。英美唯有付出了像蘇聯一樣的巨大犧牲，才表示出眞正是蘇聯的盟邦。這一步辦不到，則蘇聯對英美將保持行動的自由。（翔：譯自三月十四日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>日美空戰座談會（二）　從空襲路綫說到防禦方法種種</h3>
<p>如何應付敵機的空襲？人心動搖甚於物資損失。</p>
<p>記者請講述一些關於應付空襲的事。</p>
<p>本內，現在對於防空方面也大有進步，決不像以前了。</p>
<p>阿部是强得多了。所謂都市空襲，我們暫時不談燃燒彈所引起的火災，一般空襲的結果，最可怕者，與其說是物資損失，莫如說是人心動搖。試看一下倫敦那樣城市，雖然遭受過極嚴重的轟炸，但市民的精神總是鞏固的，鎭靜的，團結一致着。日本的都市雖然有很多地方和倫敦不同，但我們旣具有必勝的信心，如能忍耐得住首次空襲，以後則能很容易對付空襲。上次空襲完全出乎意料之外，將來的空襲雖然將是相當大的規模，如果起初能鎭靜地應付，則後來將司空見慣，比較容易對付了。</p>
<p>松浦我也認爲如此，請看普通火災，如一不加小心，就會擴大，以至於不可收拾；何况空襲的時候，一定更要緊張呢？</p>
<p>阿部因爲空襲多半都是在準備妥當了的期間來，和地震大不相同。</p>
<p>松浦是和地震不一樣的。藤旧因爲地震時，自來水會停止的。</p>
<p>松浦我們雖然是門外漢沒有這類經騐，不敢斷地確定究竟如何，但對於日本這類木材建築物，一定會有相當的不利；同時，正因爲是木材建築物，也就沒有十幾層聳立雲端的摩天樓，以致人口佔地面的比例就小。總之，人口對於地面所佔的比例旣小，那末就決不像外國那樣，人家上面總有人家，層層重疊着，所以在這一點上看，我國防空是比較有利的。</p>
<p>阿部我也這樣想，請看外國人，好多家族都住在一幢房子裏，一遇空襲，人口比損失比例一定很大。從琉散人口方面看，日本差不多都是二層建築，一輩有一個門戶，這一點眞合乎防空的原理，然而只是房子太經不起轟炸了。</p>
<p>松浦，像我們這樣的房子，即或中彈被毀，但房子的價值却比炸彈小得很多，這樣就可以和他們碰碰，究竟誰損失大。（哄堂大笑）</p>
<p>藤田　這眞是拋磚引玉，用蝦釣鱉的一種辦法。</p>
<p>本內　上次我看見發生火災時，幸虧無風，所以很容易撲滅，那末在風勢强烈時如投落燃燒彈，則一經爆發燃燒，恐有不可收拾的燎原，烈火出現吧！</p>
<p>阿部　火災一大，就沒有辦法，所以要在爆發後的一兩分鐘內，馬上動員隣組，（類似保甲組織）積極活動，撲減星星之火；但一遲延，火勢盛旺，則其燃燒的毀滅性，的確是可怕的。因爲燃燒速度是非常快的，所以一不及時撲滅星火，則足成無限的大害。</p>
<p>大西防空設備是按地區而有區別麼？</p>
<p>阿部　防空設備是無窮無盡的，沒有止境的，所以任何時候都不能說準備到何種程度才算十足完備，同時，一準備不到，往往就功虧一簣，前功盡棄。此外，以前無意造成的東西中，也有很多可以代用作防空設施的，這正如在沒有戰壕的前綫上，要拿身邊的石塊作掩護是一樣的道理。若是注意這類代替物，在都市中就會籌劃出有效的防空設施。然而正在進行戰爭的規在，不能不預計到如何可以節省物資和金屬，也應當取消臨時敷衍主義和應急主義，採用亘久主義。我國從事商民防空以來，已經有了十年歷史，現在更特別積極起來，而逐漸取得驚人的進步。正如方才所說，過夫準備的防空設施，我們可以碰到無數極有價值的東西。一言以蔽之，這是重點主義的功績。</p>
<p>松浦　東京因爲是最重要的所在，所以擁巨資而專靠利息維持生活的人，應常從東京疏散出去，只留非在東京不能過活的人，這樣或許對防空有利些。</p>
<p>阿部　這樣很好，如可能，應常帶着全部財產疏散下鄕，否則眞不堪設想。</p>
<p>松浦　如中央，或丸之內區被投燃燒彈，則服務人員雖可以從中野，吉祥寺等地方跑來搶救。</p>
<p>阿部　各地方往往按白天與黑夜之時間，人口稠密程度大有區別，所以防空的方法，也必須按晝夜而有所不同。</p>
<p>本內　雖然是講的關於防火，仍然還是以疏散人口爲上策，但眞是不容易的事。</p>
<p>細菌戰與毒氣戰之可能性？日本建築物的不燃性質漆。</p>
<p>記者：　此外，是否有人在研究防火用的不燃性塗漆呢？　阿部：是正在研究中。然而材料本身即或對於熱是非常有耐性的，但如當作塗漆而塗在東西上面，因爲塗漆膜層很薄，即使膜層本身可以在某程度上忍耐火和熱，但如這種熱一透過膜層傳到內部的燃性物上，鄱馬上就發生危險。在目前，仍然還是以水門汀和石砂作成堅固的灰泥等有用，木材中雖然也有耐火木村，塗漆中雖然也有按地方面當作防火劑用的，但如認爲如此就不會發生火災，那就有點可笑了。</p>
<p>本內：　關於屋頂也有很多爭論的規定，忘記是靜岡還是濱松，當風刮得厲害時，火就可以從瓦縫裏攢進去。如果是這樣，火就可以從屋頂裏燃燒起來。</p>
<p>阿部：現在，雖然有的在屋頂的磚瓦下面舖上一層土，有的在屋頂下面按置下不熱性材料，但因火災而溫度最先漲高的，仍然還是屋頂的裏面。因爲是從這些地方發生大火，所以要特別注意。</p>
<p>本內：滲入瓦縫，熊熊燃燒，發生大火，我眞是第一次看到。</p>
<p>阿部：目前正在進行中的，雖然因爲立刻全部房屋不能用耐火的鋼骨水泥建築，但新建築的房屋，却都按防空建築規則用不燃性材料建造。現在有的房屋都在外壁，或在最容易着火的房　裏面改換上不燃性材料，在窗戶上，或在出入口處，都按置上護板。當上次空襲以及平常發生火災時，這樣建築的房屋，有很多幸免於難的。關於防火，在日本都市裏應當有爲最主要的工作，不怕麻煩，積極準備，務必達到房屋不能燃燒目的爲止。增置水龍，溝通水道，開闢水池等等，需要多方面的準備。</p>
<p>記者：聽說有散佈細菌的一種戰術，請指敎一二。</p>
<p>阿部：在投下彈中有燃燒彈，爆炸彈，毒氣彈，細菌彈，以及傳單彈等等，但關於細菌問題，當然也需要相當麻煩的對策。所謂Beateria，和毒物不同，據說尙比較容易處理。在供給食糧的地方散佈這類東西，其預防法當然是另外一科專門問題，第五縱隊這種散佈方法，要比在天空中投落更爲有害，這都要一併估計到的。</p>
<p>大西：非專門家是有點不甚明瞭的。普通人是不能分辨出Bacteria和毒氣的。這就是需要特別防毒班的理由。對於毒氣也是一樣。</p>
<p>阿部：認識和分辨各種毒物，當然也需要特殊訓練，同時分辨和測騐毒物的器具當然也需要，關於道類設施，關係方面都準備好了。</p>
<p>松浦：對方來空襲，一定會採取各式各樣不同的方法。</p>
<p>岡田：應付對方的一切辦法，大體上都準備就緒了。</p>
<p>大西：我是在世田個谷往的，好多人都認爲在這一帶不至於投彈。若想投當然可能投，但若在軍事價値上來看，或許不至於投。沒有敵人投彈的目標，敵人就不會特意向這種地方亂投。誤投於此地，當然也可能，但……似乎有很多人都抱杞憂的感想。</p>
<p>松浦：然而一來數白架飛機，如一一找尋目標，則將花費許多時間，也許亂炸一通即行飛去。總之，如機羣爲二百架，當然是二百架飛機一同倐然出現，而一同離去，找不到目標者也決不會帶着炸彈再回</p>
<p>大西：從成層圈裏來也將是如此。</p>
<p>松浦：如果這樣，那末您的地方也不就危險了麼？</p>
<p>大西：當然有人認爲在那種情形下就糟糕了。同時也看很多人抱達觀思想，認爲那是倒霉，命運不佳。</p>
<p>松浦：任何事情不怕，這尙與達觀不同。</p>
<p>本內：在東京市裏碰運氣是不妥當的，還是回到鄕間去努力作一點事情的好。在鄉間可以努力訓練。</p>
<p>阿部：無論訓練也好，設施也好，都過於追求形式，因爲不估量當地緊急應付，這總是不大好。</p>
<p>記者：如下町這類人口密集的地方，眞有點不大好應付，我們必須估計到郊外有很多樹木，有很多空地，應當向郊外疏散。</p>
<p>阿部：現在正保持和擴大着這種綠樹蔭蔭的空地。我認爲種植防火樹等也是目前的一個任務。</p>
<p>記者：最有效的防空方法是什麼？</p>
<p>大西：事前知道敵機將來空襲，在未到市空前，即與以迎頭痛擊，全郁擊落海中，葬於魚腹，這大概是最有效的方法。</p>
<p>阿部：總之，旣然是來襲擊軍事目標的，所以最好也就以軍事力量，先發制人地擊潰敵軍。</p>
<p>大西：如果航空母艦來襲，最好是在飛機尙未離艦時，擊沉這隻航空母艦，若是從飛機塲起飛來襲，當然也就是需要把這一根據地粉碎爲上策。</p>
<p>記者：空戰比高射砲底轟擊更收良好的效果，是否這樣？</p>
<p>大西：很對。高射砲很不容易射中，如此說也許不大洽當，但在空戰裏，却很容易擊中目標。所以高射砲這類防空用具，倒沒有多大效力。轟炸海軍去的人們，高射砲眞是無法對付他們。</p>
<p>岡田：我們最擔心的，正如方才阿部先生所說的，是對方空襲的目的爲動搖人心。無論遭受如何的空襲，在戰爭上並不算失敗，請看一下倫敦現狀，馬上就可以曉得，因此我們可以知道，如果我們的精神條件和思想環境非常健全，那末空襲規模不論大小，都不會發生若何效果。恐怕未來空襲的規模相當大一定會發生某種程度的悲慘狀况。於是乎發生某種程度的混亂，當然也是難免的。日本人定會擎得起這種痛苦，忍耐得住成了習慣，就不會混亂了。那末，需要一天，還是兩天，還是一星期才能慣這成了問題。我的朋友從倫敦回來說，倫敦遭受空襲的最初，曾經有過大混亂，我認爲這是沒有辦法的，很容易地渡過那種空襲呢，還是需要三天或一星期的混亂呢，這却是問題，如何防止混亂問題，我認爲這是人民的果斷或猶預問題，如在星期天早晨，正當出門時，發出警報，我們在非出門不可的情形下，我認爲出門也無妨，但應當整理妥當，即或不在家，也要拜托隣人照看，或留下一個人看家，當在外面遇到緊急警報時，身邊總帶着一條手巾，如果能這樣鎭靜果斷，則不至於慌張失措。然而我們首先應當知道，如果認爲預備警報並不是打算叫人心緊張起來，於是自騙自地不作任何準備，而在逍遙自在的當兒，敵機如飛臨市空，那末這就會手忙脚亂慌張失措了。問題統在此。有很多人對於上次警報，曾抱懷疑態度，所以東打聽西打聽是否是眞的，但旣然是關於軍隊當局的統帥問題，決不會毫無根據地亂發警報，若知道軍隊當局的目的，是在使民衆如何有秩序地服從領導，這也就沒有懷疑的道理存在了。眞是有很多人打聽的，如果總是用這種態度對付醫報，那末如果眞是空襲來了，就會發生頂大的危險。因此，問題總是在於對空襲賜以正確認識，如國民眞正認識後，即使發生大規模空襲，也不至精神失常，思想混亂。敵人的任務是在於擾亂思想，動搖精神的，那末找們的井然有序，就會使對方的企圖全歸泡影，即使房屋燒掉十幢或二十幢，這算不了大事。我是這樣想的，不知是否正確？</p>
<p>本內：在上次四月十八日空襲時，即使那樣精神不安，但也沒出什麼事，因爲大家都像傻子般望着天空，並沒有害怕。今後也許如此吧！</p>
<p>岡田：所以呵，再來就不是那　小規模了，如是大規模的空襲，豈不是要更精神不安麼？如不使混亂程度加大，則只有現在需要知道未來空襲一定是大規模的，必須有這種準備，這就是我的意思。因此，我認爲這也就是此次座談會所需要談的。</p>
<p>本內：然而關於來空襲日本，大概都這樣相信的吧！</p>

<h3>經濟界領袖</h3>
<p>自人民方面觀察，一切更進步的社曾經濟狀態，實有賴於經濟界領袖的支持與推進，蓋經濟界領袖，非特爲經濟事業的領袖，抑目爲經濟思想的領袖，其控制人民的權威，却不在政治領袖之下。</p>
<p>經濟界領袖同時旣爲經濟思想的領袖，所以對於人民生活，必須有澈底的認識，對於人民意旨，必須有澈底的瞭解。換一句話說，所籌謀的策略與方法，必須以適合人民生活的環境與人民意旨的要求爲依歸，爲根據。尤其重要的一個條件，爲經價界領袖所必須備具的，就是思想合理化。一切措施，一切處置，祇要是當時當地環境所許可的，祇要是於政府無損，於人民有益的，儘可多多建議，多多貢獻，毋慮政府不會接納，不愁人民不會歡迎。</p>
<p>我們希望於經濟界領袖者，不僅在於參加政府所指定的某一部門工作，而在於運用其合理化的思想，以謀得當前社會與經濟問題的基層解決。所謂基層解決，必須集中思想與力量於（一）協助政府調劑財政，使成爲强化的財政，（二）協助政府增加生產，使成爲有秩序的生產。因爲，有了以上兩個基　的解決，自會得到整個人民生活問題的基層解決。</p>
<p>上海是號稱全國經濟界領袖集中的一個地方，現在巳經踏進經濟改革試騐中的初步階段，相信在不久的將來，上海經濟界領袖的建樹，定會在全國的經濟界中，放一奇的光彩，創一新的紀錄。</p>
<h3>石渡經濟顧問暢談　國府金融通貨政策</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　國府最高經濟顧問石渡氏，於十八日與華北開發公司總裁津島氏同道赴滬，於十九日下午三時在華懋飯店會見記者團，就新情勢下之國府金融通貨政策以及物資，統制等問題，發表談詁，其中如儲備券與日本圓之滙兌，近將按照十八圓比率開始辦理。儲備券對聯銀劵之關係，近亦將決定米之收買繼構，暫不列入全國商業統制總會之下屬機構，而歸糧食部直接管轄等數點，頗爲重要，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>金融通貨問題</p>
<p>儲備券之發行額，去秋曾有相當增加，然自本年以來，收回頗見順利，二三月發行額有若干收縮，此乃因充作收買資金而放出於內地之儲備券，現正逐漸流還所致，因軍票與儲備券一體化之促進，今後儲備券發行額，以需要關係當再予以增加，但此並非為通貨膨脹，而軍票與儲備券實現一體化之同時，儲備券對日本圓之匯兌，將按照十八圓比率開始辦理。至儲備券與聯銀卷之關係，目下正由政府與各方研究中，最近當可有具體決定。邇來上海方面有多數未經國府認可而私自設立之小銀行，此實足以擾亂國府之金融統制，故擬採取斷然措置。</p>
<p>物資統制問題</p>
<p>物資移動統制，此次業經緩和，統制事務，亦決定委由民間自主團體之全國商業統制總會負責辦理。自物資移動限制發表以來，物價均見低落，實屬可喜。惟全國商業統制總會方吿成立，機構尙未充實，是以擬儘速促進其充實，完成其下屬機構，將設置物資統制組織，然米之收買暫不置於統制總會之統轄下，決由國民政府糧食部直接管轄，將來統制總會之組織完善後，將再　置於統制總會之下。</p>
<p>財政問題</p>
<p>治外法權之撤廢，在最近將來當可實行，課稅權之收回問題，亦包括在內。惟國民政府之本年度預算，對於因撤廢治外法權而起之增加稅收，尙未加以考慮。另有爲籌劃米穀收買資金而計劃發行糧食庫券（暫定名）一事，亦在計劃中。至於獎券之發行，亦在考慮中，最近亦或可實現。</p>
<h3>日在華國策公司　變更基本政策</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊據同盟社訊：蘇中開發公司東京支店理事園田，昨日在百老匯大厦接見新聞記者時，透露日本在華國策公司之基本政策，將有重要變更，渠霄此種國策資本物料，及天然資源，此後常逐漸取給於華中方面。此項一九四三年財務年度之新政策，係與過去之政策相反，因過去該公司等之資本及物料，全係仰賴日本云。圜田係最近抵達此閒，與華中開發公司總公司職員，及此間財界領袖，會商日本在華國策公司今後之動向。渠言該公司等在來年之活動，將注重軍用品之生產，及開發戰時工業。自大東亞戰爭發生後，賅公司等之營業方針，雖有各項改革，但在去年中各該公司之活動仍有順利進展。江浙地區之開發程序，亦有順利之進步，華中之重要天然資源，現正依照計劃順利開發。各公司之預算，係根據開發重要天然資源，培養日本作戰力爲主要目的而編算者，經有關當局愼重審查後，已由內閣企劃院通過。</p>
<h3>全國商統會成立後　本市商業趨入正軌　昨日續開理監事會議　新聞集中秘書長辦理</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會自成立以來，對於會務進行極爲緊張，昨日續開理監事臨時聯席會議，除議決各項要案外，並規定嗣後發表新聞，概由秘書長集中辦理，所有稿件均經秘書長核閱蓋章，留底，再行發出，以期正確愼重。</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立後，本埠之商業活動，將由畸形的囤積轉變爲正常的販　。蓋目前由上海還至內地之貨物，除規定必須向商統會領取許可證之各項汽軍零件，石油，各種機械，通訊器具材料，金屬品，藥品，橡皮，棉紗布，臘燭，火柴，肥皂，糖等十一項及搬入品如米，麥，豆類等項外，其餘均許自由搬出運入，故今後上海商業，當可趨入正軌，日來若干商家，已有將香烟等貨裝運至內地銷售，而內地若干非統制貨物，亦已運來上海，故此後內地及上海之物價，將可漸次平復矣。</p>
<h3>工部局物資登記卷宗　即將移交商統會辦理</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　全國商業統制總會，已於本月十五日正式宜吿成立，惟關於物資移動簽發許可證一事，因工部局尙未將物資登記有關案卷移交，致對簽發移動證事宜，尙無從辦理。經該會首次瑯監事會議議決，（一）工部局所有各業存貨登肥全部卷宗，應即移交該會接收。（二）各業儘於廿三日前辦妥存貨登肥。（三）未辦妥登記以前，各業自動一律停止移動。（四）在會員大會未成立前，上項辦法，華商方面由市商會，日商方面由商工會議所，分別轉知各業照辦，當由該會將上項辦法，轉知市商會曁商工會議所，轉知各有關同業公會，一體知照，至於工部局物資移動簽發證之卷宗，即將轉交商統會接收辦理。聞各業同業公會若橡膠業等，均已遵命通吿各該業會員，各貨中　期至各該公會領表登記，並於未辦妥登記前，自動一律停止移動，藉便保持自有權益。否則如抱觀望，自誤延不登記，或擅目移動而發生阻礙，甚至干禁，各業公會概不負責。至於登記品名，各公會均列表另行通知</p>
<h3>兩行票擄代理交換</h3>
<p>本市銀行業聯合準備委員會，昨日通函各交換銀行略云：茲訂定於三十二年三月二十二日起，由本會開始代理通濟中國藥業兩銀行票據交換，並編定通濟銀行在交換所號次爲54-2，中國藥業銀行在交換所號次爲54-3。</p>

<h3>市府布告　戰時物資移動辦法</h3>
<p>戰時物資移動取締實行條例，本月十一日業經國府明令公佈，茲悉本市市政府昨將該項條例內所規定之物資移動辦法，佈吿本市商民一致遵照奉行云。內開：「爲佈吿事：茲遵照中華民國三十二年三月十一日國民政府頒布之戰時物資移動取締暫行條例規定，節錄物資移動辦法布吿如後：（甲）左列各項物資除法定機關許可者外，不得移動：（一）兵器彈藥。（二）火藥及其原料。（三）雅片及麻醉藥品。（乙）左列各項物資由上海地　運至區域內（蘇，浙，皖三省及上海，南京兩特別市）者，應得全國商業統制總會之許可：（一）各種汽車及其另件。（二）汽車用汽油及石油類。（三）各種機械類。（四）通信器具材料。（包括另件及電池）。（五）金屬（包括銀圓原材料，非鐵金屬及其製品）。（六）藥品（指醫療及工業用者國藥除外及染料）。（七）橡皮（包括舊橡皮及製品）。（八）棉紗布及其製品。（九）臘燭（包括原料）。（十）火柴。（十一）肥皂。（十二）　。（丙）左列各項物資由區城內（蘇，浙，皖三省及上海南京兩特別市）還至上海地區者，應得全國商業統制總會之許可：（一）米（糯米除外）麥，小麥粉，豆類，（）二棉花。凡由上海地區運往區域以外之物資應得海關之出品許可。（丁）少數自用之物資，得免除前條之許可，其標凖如次：（一）搬出（由上海地區）：棉布數量三碼（中日衣料一件量）。棉紗二盎斯，火柴五小盒，砂糖一斤，可代用之糖亦同量，臘燭一盒六枝，臘燭原料二〇〇）　蘭姆，肥皂半打六塊，洗衣肥皂亦同量。（二）搬入（往上海地區）：米二公斤，小麥，小麥粉五公斤，豆類五升。（三）棉花概不認爲自用。以上所列各項物資移動，如未經許可，擅自搬運移動或自用品携帶超出數量者，本府概遵照取締法令嚴予處分或沒收，佈吿週知，此佈。」</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>自治經濟統制的實現</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖三省的物資移動統制，移交國府後，國府爲適應時勢起見，將其交與民間自治統制，全國商業統制總會，就是專司其事的民閒組織。經濟統制全面移交與華方的重大意義，吾人應有深切之認識，同時國府能下決心，委諸經濟團體自治統制更不得不贊佩國府之賢明措置。新統制機構，必能使物資暢通，恢復上海的生產性，同時可達到內地的經濟自給。確立中國戰時經濟，它貢獻之大，自無贅述之必要。</p>
<p>全國商業就制總會所司的經濟統制，是自治的統制，我們對於這一點必先加以注意。統制總會的卜層組織，應即加以準備，我們沒有看見它的實際事情之前，可是確信其是代表商業界總意的機關，商業界必能體念政府的苦心，來處理經濟統制事宜，比了任何權勢的統制更爲强靱，更爲有効，前途光明，自可預卜的。况且在中國的商業團體自治統制，不乏先例，故毋須杞憂，統制總會，也不是第一次的新嘗試。中國經濟界在過去重大時期，常常做過這種工作，這是值得注意的。</p>
<p>但是統制總會，在其內容上看起來，另有劃時代的意義存在，即該會的內部，有日方商行參加，完全以平等條件協助經濟活動。民間的合作，最爲重要，這是我們時常揭　的。而目眞正的民閒合作，唯有站於平等條件的友誼協力，而統制總會就能做到這一點，這是引爲欣快的。還有一端值得提出的，就是日方商行關於平等條件能够積極協力來適應新情勢。對於未來的新體　是值得慶幸的。</p>
<p>可是，統制總會的當前問題，非常重大。爲謀打開現在華中經濟的新生命，培養戰力，尙須下最大努力，假使運用方向錯誤，那就等於新中國的自殺行爲，幸而該總會有唐壽民。吳震修氏等多數能幹人材，同時又有財界巨頭協助，自治的統制一定可以順利推進無誤。最後應該注意的，在統制總會的整備過程中，財界方面，不免有所變動，或許隨着流通的暢通，某一種的物價，會一度驣貴。假使因爲道種目前的現象而驚異懷疑這個轉變階段，這可謂係不辨現實，不理解統制原理的誤會。我們對於統制總會，要存着扶育它的心，不應該下輕率的判斷。須要淸晰地認識它，使其成長，唯有它才是維繫中日兩國的根源。（雲鵬：譯自三月十七日大陸新報）</p>

        <h1>1943.03.21</h1>
<p>Two months into the war, apart from the moral support, there seems to be no substantial assistance to our ally, Japan, for which we should feel ashamed. However, the realities manifested by the Chinese and Japanese authorities since entering the war have provided what we have been seeking for a century. The guarantees of China's independence and freedom, as stipulated in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, can now be said to be dawning. As the National Government increasingly embarks on a sound course, private enterprises seem to have hope of taking this opportunity to revitalize themselves, hence entering the war. The interrelationship between participating in the war, nation-building, and industrial development is also gradually understood by the general public. However, it must be particularly pointed out here that the current construction, whether national or private, must first consider the needs of participating in the war and whether it is beneficial to participating in the war; otherwise, everything will be in vain. Therefore, nation-building and industrial development during the period of participation in the war naturally have their limitations and characteristics.</p>
<p>Today, when we talk about nation-building, we indeed rely on the goodwill assistance of our ally, Japan, such as the supply of capital, technology, and machinery. However, in a general sense, the responsibility of completing the great task of nation-building is originally borne by us freely, and we must prepare for it immediately today, without any pretense or slackness. It is undeniable that our country is currently backward in industry, inconvenient in transportation, lacks capital, and has immature technology. Speaking of the great task of nation-building, there are truly numerous things to be done. However, precisely because of this, we must have a comprehensive and detailed plan, distinguish between urgency and importance, predetermine steps, and earnestly promote it. We must devote all our efforts to the important and urgent matters and complete them within a time limit. We will temporarily set aside the less important and less urgent matters and gradually plan their construction. In the past, because of the eagerness to achieve governance, we often planned too many things, and human and financial resources were insufficient. Therefore, some projects could not be completed as scheduled, or they encountered setbacks midway due to insufficient talent. From now on, we must resolutely change our style. We will not undertake projects without sufficient funding or without appropriate talent. For those projects that must be undertaken, we should strive for their completion with a spirit of competition and meticulousness. In particular, we must strive for accuracy and eliminate the long-standing habits of seeking to do too many things, competing with each other, only focusing on appearances, and not valuing achievements. In this way, various undertakings can be completed effectively, and the central government's finances can avoid severe pressure. This is the first point.</p>
<p>When we talk about the great task of nation-building, judging from the literal meaning, it seems that all matters related to the future of the country should be handled by the government. What private individuals operate has nothing to do with nation-building, nor can it be expected to be completed by private individuals' efforts. But in reality, in addition to certain special departments that must be fully planned by the government, many undertakings rely on the cooperation and promotion of the people. We hope that the government will establish a design and guidance institution, and enable the business community to use allied loans and absorb floating capital through formal securities markets to assist the government in developing industries. If the government has such a design and guidance institution, it can now classify and geographically specify various projects that should and can be done, and accurately announce them to the public, guide investment, and provide practical assistance to private enterprises. In this way, those with capital will know where to go, the degree of floating capital mischief can be considerably reduced, private industries will gradually develop, and progress in the national economy can be expected immediately. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Within the economic sphere, nation-building and industrial development are actually two sides of the same coin. The government undertaking projects is nation-building, and the people undertaking projects is also nation-building. In the war, everyone should be a soldier, and in the great task of nation-building, everyone can strive for first merit. Based on this concept, we believe that those with capital should have a broad vision and lofty aspirations, not seek immediate gains or quick profits, plan enterprises to benefit the country and the people, and currently, in addition to the necessary use of financial resources in business, they should save as much as possible in preparation for post-war needs. Reducing the circulation of legal tender at present is not only of great benefit to the country, but also the best plan for expanding their own business in the future. This is the third point.</p>
<p>In short, participating in the war is extremely important for winning national independence and freedom, but national independence and freedom can only be permanently guaranteed if nation-building is successful. Therefore, nation-building and industrial development are also extremely important. We sincerely hope that both the upper and lower levels will invigorate themselves, work hard in their respective positions, be pragmatic and realistic, and jointly achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Shifts in US Policy toward the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>During the course of the German-Soviet war, the United States witnessed the unexpected strength of the Soviet Union. As a result, discussions on the need for a fresh perspective on US policy toward the Soviet Union were rife. Consequently, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley, was the first to issue a statement criticizing the Soviet authorities for "not informing the public of the details of US aid to the Soviet Union." The most subtle aspect was that those greatly alarmed by Standley's statement were not the criticized Soviet government, but rather the American government and public themselves.</p>
<p>US aid to the Soviet Union is a fact. According to the review report released by the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in late February, since the application of the US Lend-Lease Act to the Soviet Union in November 1941, until the end of last year, the materials supplied to the Soviet Union amounted to $1.532 billion. This included 5,600 aircraft and 6,200 tanks. Whether the aforementioned figures unilaterally released by the United States are accurate is unknown; even if they are true, it is also questionable whether the aforementioned materials can completely reach the Soviet Union. But in any case, we must admit that the United States has indeed supplied the Soviet Union with a considerable amount of military supplies. The aforementioned supply volume is only slightly less than one-third of the US aid to the UK, but it is about ten times the US aid to Chiang. Standley's statement that "the Soviet Union is by no means fighting solely on its own" is not an unreasonable fabrication.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union also has its own argument. The enormous sacrifices made by the Soviet Union in the war against Germany are insignificant compared to US aid to the Soviet Union. "The Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa is not considered a second front. If the UK and the US, with their national destinies at stake, are determined to form a common front with the Soviet Union, they should realize that they must make significant sacrifices and resolutely open a strong second front in Western Europe"—is this not the Soviet Union's view? The Soviet Union provides its human resources to defend the UK and the US, while the US supplies the Soviet Union with necessary materials within the range that ensures its own security. Once victory is achieved in the war, the US will be able to secure the strongest voice. The Soviet Union will not be indifferent to Roosevelt's self-serving attempt.</p>
<p>Standley's intentional statement, from the Soviet Union's independent standpoint, easily raises the risk of causing a negative attitude towards the United States. This is why the United States and even the United Kingdom were extremely embarrassed by Standley's gaffe. If the Soviet Union breaks away from the Anglo-American camp, the UK and the US will face an unprecedented crisis. This is an ironclad fact. While Standley made sarcastic attacks on the Soviet government, US Vice President Wallace claimed on the one hand that "do not quarrel with the Soviet Union" and is now restraining domestic Soviet phobias, expressing flattery to the Soviet Union. However, the re-recognition of the Soviet Union's strength, at the same time, the atmosphere of US vigilance against the Soviet Union, is visibly intensifying. Critic Trosh Thompson warned the nation that "the victory of the Soviet Union means the redization of the world." American "Soviet expert" Duranty criticized Stalin's realism and warned that American dependence on the Soviet Union should be limited. The New York Times said that the demands of the Soviet Union should be curbed. These are just a few examples.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's growing strength after the war contains the meaning of the redization of Europe, and at the same time, there is a fear of direct conflicts of interest with the Soviet Union in West Asia. This is naturally a very unpleasant situation for the United States. However, in order to overcome the current crisis, it has no choice but to continue to cooperate with the Soviet Union. This dilemma makes the United States and even the United Kingdom feel caught in a difficult position and need to deal with it carefully.</p>
<p>However, the Anglo-Saxons are ultimately cunning and shrewd people. Because Stalin is not easily tempted by the UK and the US, they may have deliberately instructed Standley to create waves out of nowhere in order to have personal contact with Stalin. As a result, there were rumors of reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union, and the origin of the Roosevelt visit to the Soviet Union may have originated from this, it is not known. Even so, Roosevelt's visit to the Soviet Union and the supply of weapons may not necessarily lead to a sharp reversal of the estrangement between the UK and the US. The Soviet Union firmly demands that the UK and the US should make huge sacrifices. Only by making huge sacrifices like the Soviet Union can the UK and the US show that they are truly allies of the Soviet Union. If this step cannot be achieved, the Soviet Union will maintain freedom of action towards the UK and the US. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on March 14)</p>
<h3>North China Political Affairs Commission Convenes Provincial and Municipal Leaders' Meeting; Wang Yintai Reports on Economic Policies; Leaders Hope for Appropriate Handling</h3>
<p>Beijing, 20th (Central News Agency) The North China Political Affairs Commission held a meeting of North China provincial and municipal leaders at the Beijing Diplomatic Building on the 20th. Zhu Shen, Chairman of the Commission, and other supervisors and directors, as well as the governors of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, and the mayors of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, attended the meeting. After the meeting began, Chairman Zhu first introduced the newly appointed provincial and municipal leaders to all the representatives attending the meeting, and then explained the new mission of North China after the National Government entered the war, the establishment of an independent and autonomous political system, and the true meaning of the two major issues of public security and food supply for stabilizing people's livelihood, and requested the cooperation of the provincial and municipal leaders. Next, the provincial governors and mayors below the Governor of Hebei Province reported on the local situation, and finally discussed food and other important issues. After a brief rest at noon, the informal discussions continued from 3:00 pm. The main points of Chairman Zhu's instructions are recorded as follows: "After China entered the war, the mission of North China has become more important. In the future, the people of the whole country should seek self-reliance and should not completely rely on our ally, Japan. Now, to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China, the most important prerequisites are to ensure public security and food supply. However, in this extraordinary period, it is only natural to feel the difficulty of food supply. The commission is urgently seeking solutions, and this issue has been thoroughly reviewed during the consultation meeting held earlier. Today, we invite all local leaders to make full discussions here based on the current situation in various places to conduct prudent research."</p>
<p>Beijing, 20th (Central News Agency) The North China Provincial and Municipal Leaders' Meeting continued this afternoon.

<h3>Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in China to be Succeeded by Lieutenant General Matsui; Announcement by the Japanese Army Ministry</h3>

<p>Matsui's Talk</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The newly appointed Chief of Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, Lieutenant General Matsui, met with reporters at his residence at 1:30 pm on the 20th and made the following statement: "The mission of the Expeditionary Army will be heavier in both combat and construction aspects in the future. At this important moment, I have been appointed as the Chief of Staff despite my lack of talent. I am treading on thin ice and dare not be negligent. I will abide by the intentions of the Commander-in-Chief in everything, and strive not to be unworthy of my position. Premier and Army Minister Tojo personally visited China a few days ago, and we are also celebrating the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The cooperation between Japan and the National Government is becoming more and more consolidated, and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese armies is becoming closer. At this time, in order to thoroughly achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War, the Expeditionary Army must devote all its efforts to defeating Chongqing and the American and British armies. Fortunately, I have been in Beijing for a long time, and I have many teachers, friends, and acquaintances on both sides of China and Japan who can give me advice. Therefore, I am very willing to do my best and sincerely hope that all officials and people will provide assistance and support."</p>
<p>Matsui's Brief History</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) Today, the Defense Ministry announced that Lieutenant General Matsui has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army to succeed Lieutenant General Kawahara, who has been transferred to another position.

In 1930, he was dispatched to the United States for military investigation. In October of the following year, he was appointed as the staff officer of the Kwantung Army, and then served as the commander of the Osaka district. In 1939, he rejoined the Kwantung Army and served as a military advisor to the State of Manchuria. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, he participated in the Malayan War, leading his soldiers to land in southern Thailand.

<h3>Japanese Army on the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Shells Chongqing Ships, Sinking Seven Large Vessels; Two Warehouses Destroyed</h3>
<p>Hankou, 20th (Central News Agency) The artillery unit of the Japanese army in Hubei Province, having detected an increase in Chongqing ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River near Pingshanba (8 kilometers northwest of Yichang) and Xiling Mountain (5 kilometers north of Yichang), used multiple mountain guns hidden in the Jiangjunshan frontline position to fiercely shell Chongqing ships loaded with military supplies and the Pingshanba and Xiling port facilities from dawn on the 16th. The attacks continued throughout the day. The Chongqing army, suffering this unexpected blow, either fled from the boats or abandoned their positions and fled far away, causing extreme confusion. The Chongqing side's loss of this large number of ships is unimaginable, and since the Yangtze River waterway is controlled by the Japanese army, it will be even more difficult for the Chongqing side to transport supplies to Yichang as replenishment. In this battle, a total of seven large Chongqing ships were sunk (including five ships of 700 to 1,500 tons and two ships of 500 tons), as well as one small vessel and one sailboat were heavily damaged. There were also six large vessels damaged (including two ships of 700 to 1,500 tons and four ships of 500 tons), as well as many small vessels and sailboats. In addition, two military supply warehouses, one mountain gun position, four mortar positions, one weather station, and the port facilities were hit and caught fire, completely destroyed.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Southern District Shipping Company by Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shonan, 20th – To facilitate the exchange of goods among the occupied Southern Territories centered around Malaya's Shonan, etc., the military administration here, in order to improve shipping efficiency, previously ordered the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Southern Sea Transport Company, which operate in Shonan, to establish the Southern Shipping Company. After receiving the order, the three companies immediately began preparations and have now completed them. A founding general meeting was held here on the 20th at the Military Administration Supervision Department. It is reported that the company's head office will be located in Shonan, and branch offices or agencies are planned to be established in important locations in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, such as Penang, Medan, and Palembang. In terms of business, it will not only specialize in coastal shipping between Malaya and Sumatra, but also operate shipping between occupied territories such as Burma and the Philippines. When necessary, it will also be responsible for transportation matters between Thailand and Vietnam. Furthermore, it plans to closely coordinate with local shipping companies to be established soon in Burma,  Island, and other places to fully develop  transportation efficiency. The ships used by the company will be provided by local construction or leased ships. Ships belonging to the Maritime Affairs Bureau, state governments, and the Japanese military will also be lent to the company for use, within the scope that does not hinder operations.

<h3>Burmese Buddhists Celebrate "March Festival"</h3>

<h3>Introduction of Members of the Japanese Cultural Envoy Delegation: Dr. Shioya Presents His Secret Collection, "The Great Unification Song"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Telephone) The Japanese Cultural Envoy Delegation participating in the commemoration of the return of the capital to China, led by Dr. On Shioya, Professor Emeritus of Tokyo University, a leading expert in the study of Chinese literature, departed from Tokyo on the night of the 22nd, traveling by land to Nanking. The doctor  has gifts to present to Chairman Wang, Foreign Minister Chu, and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, namely, "The Great Unification Song" which Dr. Shioya has secretly held. "The Great Unification Song" is the lifelong work of Dr. Shioya's great-grandfather, Waka-in Weng, a Confucian official of the late Edo period. The entire work is written in classical Chinese in four-character lines, recording the historical events of the successive Japanese emperors. It is a national anthem of Japan that elucidates the great righteousness, filial piety, and the origins of the national polity. It was proofread and annotated by Dr. Shioya's father, Kazutaka Hara, and Kiyama Shioya, and printed by the Cabinet Printing Bureau Asahi Company in 1913. It is a rare book written in classical Chinese about Japanese history. Preparing to depart at his residence in Hisakane-cho, Koishikawa, he said in his busy schedule with joy at visiting Nanking:</p>
<p>"Carrying ten books is quite heavy. I will use the presentation of this book to introduce Japan's national polity, which I deeply believe is fortunate. On the way through Seoul, there will be a slight delay. It is scheduled to arrive in Nanking on the 29th. To promote Sino-Japanese friendship through thought and culture is only second to the fundamental problems of the military and economic aspects. In this cultural aspect, the revival of the inherent Eastern virtues of benevolence and righteousness is my private wish. When Mr. Tsai and Mr. Chu Minyi visited Japan at the end of last year, I made an appointment with Mr. Chu to definitely go to Nanking in April. I am deeply moved that I can now fulfill this promise."</p>
<p>Since the capital was established, contact between Dr. Shioya and Mr. Tsai has been maintained in various forms. When Mr. Tsai returned to the capital, he entrusted his own state of mind to a poem by Bian:</p>
<p>Indeed, the sun shines brightly on the South,</p>
<p>Transforming the scenery into  glowing clouds.</p>
<p>Four hundred million people  are all red,</p>
<p>Surely spreading the flowers of freedom everywhere.</p>
<p>Someone showed this poem to the doctor, and the doctor responded with a poem:</p>
<p>Four hundred million people  are all virtuous and radiant,</p>
<p>The sunny sky and white sun reflect the rosy clouds,</p>
<p>Peaceful nation-building brings back the leaves of spring,</p>
<p>Blooming and vying to open the flowers of East Asia.</p>
<p>The doctor gifted the poem, with deep meaning. The doctor solemnly carried a poem he had clipped from the newspaper three years ago:</p>
<p>"I plan to present this for your perusal during our meeting this time."</p>
<p>While saying this, he placed this five-centimeter square piece of old newspaper into his business card holder. With the freshness of a young man and an impatient face, he eagerly hoped to meet with Mr. Tsai and others again. (Sho: Translated from the Continental Daily News, March 21)</p>
<h3>Mr. Tanigawa Reveals His Feelings about Visiting China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Telephone) Mr. Tetsuzo Tanigawa, one of the members of the Cultural Envoy Delegation, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for China on February 26 with Mr. Saneatsu Mushanokoji. At his residence in Higashida-cho, Suginami Ward, he told reporters, "This is my fifth time going to China." The following is what he said to reporters:</p>
<p>When the National Government returned to the capital, I was in Shanghai with Mr. Takeo Kato and Mr. Yoshio Toyoshima, and I was happy to celebrate the return of the capital. It has been three years now, and I think the situation of China's revitalization has greatly progressed. Every time I go to China, I meet with important figures of the National Government and have various discussions about Sino-Japanese relations. What I especially want to see on this trip to China is the activities of the intellectual class in China. Japan's policy towards China has recently made significant progress, and with this opportunity, I should be able to see joyful and lively activities among the Chinese intellectual class. The return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have given the people of the emerging China vitality and light. China has become a truly independent country, and its bright future is set, so I know that I will definitely see their lively activities.</p>
<p>However, in the future, Japan should further strengthen the opportunity for co-prosperity with China. With this in mind, I would like to listen to the opinions of the people there and reveal my own thoughts. When I return, I will view the ancient art of China with Mr. Mushanokoji, and I am scheduled to return to Tokyo around April 20. (Ding: Translated from the Continental Daily News, March 21)</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops in the Kursk Salient Risk Being Cut Off; German Pressure Increases on Chuguev</h3>
<p>Alliance News Agency, Stockholm, 20th – According to news from the German-Soviet battlefront received here last night, the German army intensified its attack on the north side of the southern front of the Soviet army on Thursday. The Soviet troops protruding in the Kursk area are in danger of being cut off. Furthermore, the German army continued to cross the upper reaches of the Donets River northeast of Kharkov. A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that the great battle on the Donets River east of Kharkov has reached a critical stage. Both sides are engaging in fierce battles with large infantry and tanks on the half-frozen river, with uncertain advances and retreats. In some places, the Soviet army was forced to retreat, but the outcome of the battle has not yet been decided. German troops on the Chuguev front east of Kharkov are constantly receiving reinforcements, and the pressure is increasing. The German army has chosen several locations along the 150-mile line of the Donets River to set up pontoon bridges at night, which the Soviet army cannot prevent. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, the Soviet army attempted to infiltrate German positions near Chuguev, about 20 miles southeast of Kharkov. The purpose was clearly to relieve the siege of the Soviet army south of the city, but the Soviet attack was repelled, and the German army made progress. Even if the Soviet reinforcements broke through the German lines, it would be too late, as the Soviet army surrounded south of Kharkov has already been annihilated. As for the area north of Kharkov, after the German army occupied Belgorod, the two armies are currently engaged in fierce battles between the city and Kursk. Although the Soviet army is resisting stubbornly, the German army is gradually advancing northeast. From this, it can be seen that the German commander's purpose is clearly to flank the Soviet army's protruding positions in the Kursk area. This is the last area that the German army must recapture in order to restore the Orel to Kharkov front. In addition, the Red Army continued to launch large-scale attacks in the Orel area, south of Vyazma, and the Yuteraya Lusa area south of Lake Ilmen. It is reported that the Red Army deployed multiple infantry divisions and tank brigades to attack the German lines, disregarding its significant losses, but without any progress. South of Vyazma on the central front, the Soviet army lost 93 tanks, and in the Steraya Lusa area, the Soviet army also lost 18 tanks, with thousands of casualties. The German Air Force continued to launch heavy attacks on the Soviet army on the eastern front and its supply lines. The Soviet side lost 58 aircraft on Thursday.</p>
<h3>Content of the Eden Meeting: Review of Principles Related to the International Situation; Soviet Government Will Remain Silent on China</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Argentinian City, 20th – According to a dispatch from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden, after arriving here, quickly held talks with U.S. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Litvinov. Regarding the content of the talks, Hull announced at a reception for reporters on the 18th that Foreign Secretary Eden and we held talks, which were less about discussing specific cases and more about discussing various principles and policies. The purpose of the talks was to review various principles that the anti-Axis governments can apply to the international political situation now and in the future. The results of the talks were beneficial to each other and very good. Observers here said that, judging from Hull's remarks, there is still little consensus among the anti-Axis countries on various principles and policies. As for the management after the war, it is not easy to resolve. There are still many difficulties regarding everything in the future. Eden's consultation with key figures in the U.S. government was exploratory in nature, but it also proved to be quite difficult.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th – The Soviet government is maintaining a silent attitude towards Eden's meeting in Washington. Soviet newspapers and wireless dispatches have not published any comments on this. However, this silence has been broken by a TASS dispatch from Washington. The news released by the agency was published in newspapers across the Soviet Union. It is said that the scope of Eden's meeting in the United States was quite broad. In addition to discussing the promotion of cooperation between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it also discussed post-war financial and economic issues. The agency also mentioned that Eden refused to discuss the Soviet-Polish border issue, which the Soviet Union considers to be one of the important issues. At a time when the Soviet Union is engaged in a battle for life and death, the United Kingdom and the United States neglected the interests of the Soviet Union and engaged in empty talk about post-war financial issues, which was dissatisfactory to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet government has rarely made any statements on foreign policy in the past three weeks. Stalin will inevitably maintain strict silence on the consultations made by the Allies in Washington. However, at home, there is extensive propaganda to make the Soviet people aware that what the Allies are currently discussing is not a Soviet issue, but a post-war capitalist issue. "Pravda" recently published an article pointing out that the Soviet Union is fighting alone. All of these are consistent with the Soviet government's propaganda policy, making the people aware that capitalism is still the Soviet Union's greatest enemy. Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States is only a wartime expediency.</p>
<h3>German Troops Withdraw from Gafsa City According to Plan; German Troops on the Tunisian Coast Occupy One Important Hilltop</h3>
<p>Alliance News Agency, Lisbon, 20th – According to a dispatch from Berlin, after the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Montgomery, attacked the German Mareth Line and was defeated, the military appearance was chaotic. German troops in the northern coastal area of Tunisia broke into British positions by ten miles on Thursday and occupied a vital hilltop. As a result, all roads in this area are under the control of the Axis forces. German troops in central Tunisia withdrew from Gafsa according to plan. Yesterday's Allied communique stated that U.S. troops operating at El Guettar (a road junction twelve miles southeast of Gafsa) had occupied Gafsa. According to a Reuters dispatch last night, Italian troops are currently holding the mountainside and the Bo Hamran Valley, controlling the secondary road from El Guettar northeast to the coastal town of Mahares. Heavy rain has fallen for the past two days, accumulating to two inches, which is a quarter of the annual rainfall, causing widespread mud. Heavy vehicles are almost impassable. U.S. military operations are also hindered until the land dries out. At the same time, Allied headquarters disclosed that there are currently three U.S. divisions operating on the Tunisian front, namely the 1st Infantry Division, the 34th Division, and the 1st Tank Division. The British Eighth Army in southern Tunisia attempted to break through the defenses of the German army under the command of General Rommel on the Mareth Line and suffered heavy losses on Tuesday night and Wednesday. The Axis forces counterattacked and repelled the British army. Yesterday's British military activity was limited to patrols, as General Montgomery was clearly reorganizing his troops for another attack.</p>

<h3>Roundtable Discussion on US-Japan Air Warfare (Part 2): From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods</h3>
<p>How to Cope with Enemy Air Raids? Public Anxiety is More Damaging Than Material Losses.</p>
<p>Reporter: Please talk about some ways to deal with air raids.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: Nowadays, there has been great progress in air defense, unlike before.</p>
<p>Abe: It is much stronger now. Regarding urban air raids, let's not talk about the fires caused by incendiary bombs for the moment. The most frightening result of a general air raid is not the loss of materials, but the shaking of people's hearts. Look at cities like London. Although they have suffered extremely severe bombing, the spirit of the citizens is always strong, calm, and united. Although there are many differences between Japanese cities and London, we have the confidence to win. If we can endure the first air raid, we can easily deal with air raids later. The last air raid was completely unexpected. Although future air raids will be quite large in scale, if we can deal with them calmly at the beginning, they will later become commonplace and easier to deal with.</p>
<p>Matsuura: I agree. Look at ordinary fires. If you are not careful, they will expand until they cannot be contained. How much more tense will it be during an air raid?</p>
<p>Abe: Air raids mostly come during a period of thorough preparation, which is very different from earthquakes.</p>
<p>Matsuura: It's different from earthquakes. Fujita: Because during earthquakes, the tap water will stop.</p>
<p>Matsuura: Although we are laymen without this kind of experience and dare not say for sure, such wooden buildings in Japan will definitely be at a considerable disadvantage. At the same time, precisely because they are wooden buildings, there are no skyscrapers towering dozens of stories high, so the proportion of the population occupying the ground is small. In short, since the proportion of the population occupying the ground is small, it is definitely not like foreign countries, where people are always on top of people, stacked layer upon layer. So, from this point of view, our country's air defense is more advantageous.</p>
<p>Abe: I think so too. Look at foreigners, many families live in one house. In the event of an air raid, the ratio of population loss will definitely be large. From the perspective of dispersed population, Japanese buildings are almost all two-story buildings, with one household per family. This is really in line with the principles of air defense. However, the houses are too vulnerable to bombing.</p>
<p>Matsuura: Houses like ours, even if they are hit by a bomb and destroyed, the value of the house is much smaller than the bomb. This way, we can compete with them to see who loses more. (Roaring laughter)</p>
<p>Fujita: This is really throwing a brick to get jade, a way to use shrimp to catch turtles.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: Last time I saw a fire, fortunately there was no wind, so it was easy to put out. If incendiary bombs are dropped when the wind is strong, once they explode and burn, I am afraid that an uncontrollable prairie fire will appear!</p>
<p>Abe: Once a fire becomes large, there is no way to deal with it. Therefore, within one or two minutes after the outbreak, we must immediately mobilize the neighborhood groups (similar to the baojia organization) to actively put out the sparks. But if we delay, the fire will become raging, and its destructive power will indeed be terrible. Because the burning speed is very fast, if we fail to put out the sparks in time, it will become an infinite disaster.</p>
<p>Ōnishi: Is air defense equipment different from region to region?</p>
<p>Abe: Air defense equipment is endless, there is no limit. Therefore, we can never say that preparations have reached a degree of complete perfection. At the same time, a slight lack of preparation often leads to failure and all previous efforts are wasted. In addition, many things that were unintentionally created in the past can be used as substitutes for air defense facilities. This is just like being on a front line without trenches, where you have to use the stones around you for cover. If we pay attention to these substitutes, we can plan effective air defense facilities in the city. However, in the current state of war, we must anticipate how to save materials and metals, and we should also eliminate temporary and stopgap measures and adopt a long-term approach. Our country has been engaged in civil air defense for ten years and is now becoming particularly active, gradually making amazing progress. As I said just now, we can find countless valuable things in the over-prepared air defense facilities. In a word, this is the achievement of the principle of prioritizing key points.</p>
<p>Matsuura: Since Tokyo is the most important place, people who rely on huge sums of money and live off interest should often evacuate from Tokyo, leaving only those who cannot live without Tokyo. This may be beneficial to air defense.</p>
<p>Abe: That's great. If possible, they should always evacuate to the countryside with all their property, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Matsuura: If the central area or the Marunouchi district is hit by incendiary bombs, service personnel can run from places like Nakano and Kichijoji to rescue.</p>
<p>Abe: Different places often have very different population densities during the day and at night. Therefore, air defense methods must also vary depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: Although we are talking about fire prevention, evacuating the population is still the best policy, but it is really not easy.</p>
<p>The Possibility of Germ Warfare and Poison Gas Warfare? The Non-Combustible Nature of Japanese Buildings.</p>
<p>Reporter: In addition, is anyone researching non-combustible paint for fire prevention? Abe: Yes, it is being researched. However, even if the material itself is very heat-resistant, if it is used as paint and applied to things, because the paint film is very thin, even if the film itself can withstand fire and heat to some extent, if this heat is transmitted through the film to the flammable material inside, it will immediately become dangerous. At present, sturdy plaster made of cement and sand is still useful. Although there is also fire-resistant wood among wood materials, and there is also paint used as a fire retardant in some areas, it would be a little ridiculous to think that this would prevent fires from occurring.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: There are also many controversial regulations regarding roofs. I forget whether it was Shizuoka or Hamamatsu, but when the wind is strong, fire can get in through the cracks in the tiles. If this is the case, the fire can start burning from inside the roof.</p>
<p>Abe: Now, although some people put a layer of soil under the roof tiles, and some people place non-heat-conducting materials under the roof, the temperature that rises first due to a fire is still inside the roof. Because major fires start from these places, we must pay special attention.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: I've never seen it before, fire seeping into the cracks in the tiles, burning fiercely, and causing a major fire.</p>
<p>Abe: Although it is currently impossible to build all houses with fire-resistant steel and concrete, newly built houses are built with non-combustible materials in accordance with air defense construction regulations. Some houses are replacing the outer walls or the insides of the rooms that are most prone to fire with non-combustible materials, and installing protective boards on windows and entrances. During the last air raid and during ordinary fires, many such buildings were spared. Fire prevention should be the most important task in Japanese cities. We must prepare diligently and strive to achieve the goal of preventing houses from burning. Increasing water dragons, connecting waterways, opening up reservoirs, and so on require many aspects of preparation.</p>
<p>Reporter: I heard that there is a tactic of spreading bacteria. Please give me some guidance.</p>
<p>Abe: Among the bombs dropped are incendiary bombs, explosive bombs, poison gas bombs, germ bombs, and leaflet bombs, etc. But of course, the issue of bacteria also requires considerable and troublesome countermeasures. So-called Bacteria are different from poisons, and it is said that they are relatively easier to deal with. Spreading this kind of thing in places that supply food requires a separate set of specialized preventive measures. This kind of spreading method by the Fifth Column is more harmful than dropping them from the sky, and this must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>Ōnishi: It is a bit unclear to non-experts. Ordinary people cannot distinguish between Bacteria and poison gas. This is the reason why a special anti-gas squad is needed. The same goes for poison gas.</p>
<p>Abe: Of course, special training is also required to recognize and distinguish various poisons, and of course, equipment for distinguishing and testing poisons is also needed. The relevant parties are prepared for these kinds of facilities.</p>
<p>Matsuura: If the enemy comes to attack, they will definitely adopt a variety of different methods.</p>
<p>Okada: On the whole, preparations have been made to deal with all the enemy's methods.</p>
<p>Ōnishi: I live in Setagaya Ward. Many people believe that this area will not be bombed. Of course, it is possible to bomb, but from a military value point of view, it may not be bombed. If there is no target for the enemy to bomb, the enemy will not deliberately bomb such a place randomly. Of course, it is possible to be mistakenly bombed here, but... it seems that many people have a feeling of groundless worry.</p>
<p>Matsuura: However, if hundreds of planes come, it will take a lot of time to find targets one by one, and they may just bomb randomly and fly away. In short, if the fleet is two hundred planes, of course two hundred planes will suddenly appear together and leave together, and those who cannot find a target will definitely not go back with the bombs.</p>
<p>Ōnishi: It will be the same if they come from the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Matsuura: If so, wouldn't your place be in danger?</p>
<p>Ōnishi: Of course, some people think that it will be terrible in that case. At the same time, many people have an optimistic idea, believing that it is bad luck, bad fate.</p>
<p>Matsuura: Not being afraid of anything is different from being optimistic.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: It is not appropriate to gamble in Tokyo. It is better to go back to the countryside and work hard to do something. In the countryside, you can work hard to train.</p>
<p>Abe: Whether it is training or facilities, they are too formalistic. It is not good not to consider the local emergency response.</p>
<p>Reporter: It is really not easy to deal with densely populated areas like Shitamachi. We must consider that there are many trees and many open spaces in the suburbs, and we should evacuate to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Abe: We are now maintaining and expanding these green open spaces. I believe that planting fire-resistant trees is also a current task.</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the most effective air defense method?</p>
<p>Ōnishi: Knowing in advance that enemy planes are coming to attack, and intercepting them before they reach the city, shooting them all down into the sea and burying them in the bellies of fish, is probably the most effective method.</p>
<p>Abe: In short, since they are coming to attack military targets, it is best to use military force to preemptively defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Ōnishi: If an aircraft carrier comes to attack, it is best to sink the aircraft carrier before the planes leave the ship. If they take off from an airfield to attack, of course, it is also best to destroy this base.</p>
<p>Reporter: Is air combat more effective than anti-aircraft artillery bombardment?</p>
<p>Ōnishi: That's right. Anti-aircraft guns are not easy to hit. It may not be appropriate to say so, but in air combat, it is easy to hit the target. Therefore, air defense equipment such as anti-aircraft guns is not very effective. Those who bomb the navy are really unable to deal with them.</p>
<p>Okada: What we are most worried about, as Mr. Abe said just now, is that the purpose of the enemy's air raid is to shake people's hearts. No matter how much air raid we suffer, it is not a failure in the war. Just look at the current situation in London and you will immediately understand. Therefore, we can know that if our spiritual conditions and ideological environment are very sound, then the scale of the air raid, no matter how large or small, will not have any effect. I am afraid that the scale of future air raids will be quite large and there will definitely be some degree of tragic situation. Then, of course, some degree of confusion is inevitable. The Japanese people will definitely be able to endure this pain and get used to it, and then there will be no confusion. Then, the question is whether it will take one day, two days, or a week to get used to it. My friend returned from London and said that there was great confusion at the beginning of the air raids in London. I think this is unavoidable. Is it easy to get through that kind of air raid, or will it take three days or a week of confusion? That is the question. How to prevent confusion is, I think, a question of people's decisiveness or hesitation. If an alarm is issued on Sunday morning when we are about to go out, and we have to go out, I think it is okay to go out, but we should get everything in order, and even if we are not at home, we should ask our neighbors to take care of it, or leave someone to watch the house. When encountering an emergency alarm outside, we should always carry a towel with us. If we can be so calm and decisive, we will not panic. However, we must first know that if we think that the preparatory alarm is not intended to make people nervous, and we deceive ourselves and do not make any preparations, and we are at ease, and then enemy planes fly over the city, then we will be at a loss and panic. The problem is all here. Many people were skeptical about the last alarm, so they inquired everywhere about whether it was real. But since it is a matter of command of the military authorities, they will never issue alarms randomly without any basis. If we know that the purpose of the military authorities is to make the public obey the leadership in an orderly manner, then there is no reason to doubt it. There were really a lot of people asking around. If we always deal with the news in this way, then if there really is an air raid, there will be a great danger. Therefore, the problem is always to give a correct understanding of air raids. If the people really understand, even if there is a large-scale air raid, they will not lose their minds or become confused. The enemy's task is to disrupt thinking and shake the spirit. Then, our orderliness will make the other party's attempt fall into the water. Even if ten or twenty houses are burned down, it is not a big deal. That is what I think. I don't know if it is correct.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: During the last air raid on April 18, even though we were so mentally uneasy, nothing happened, because everyone looked at the sky like fools and were not afraid. Maybe it will be the same in the future!</p>
<p>Okada: So, it won't be on that small scale next time. If it is a large-scale air raid, won't we be even more mentally uneasy? If we don't increase the degree of confusion, then we need to know now that the future air raid will definitely be large-scale. We must have this preparation. That is what I mean. Therefore, I think this is what needs to be discussed at this symposium.</p>
<p>Hon'nai: However, everyone probably believes that Japan will be attacked!</p>

After receiving the orders, Zhan and Bu are currently preparing to set up the offices.</p>
<p>The Application for Residence Certificates in the Urban Area is Becoming More Crowded</p>
<p>In order to ensure the consolidation of public security in the urban area and prevent bad elements from mixing in, the Municipal Police Headquarters was ordered to handle the issuance of residence certificates. The deadline for the urban area has been extended to the end of this month, and the deadline for the district police stations has been extended to the end of June. The news has already been reported in various newspapers. It is learned that the total number of residence certificates issued by various police stations and district police stations in the urban area has exceeded 1.4 million. Recently, the application for residence certificates has become increasingly crowded due to the approaching deadline.</p>
<h3>Registration for Insurance Brokers to be Extended</h3>
<p>Since the Insurance Supervisory Bureau began accepting applications for registration of insurance brokers on January 5 of this year, there has been a great enthusiasm for registration in accordance with the law from various places. In Shanghai alone, more than 500 insurance brokers have applied for registration. The review committee of the bureau has conducted separate reviews and found that some procedures were incomplete or qualifications were not met. The bureau has notified the relevant brokers to come to the bureau for individual talks and provided instructions. It is learned that more than a dozen insurance brokers from various places who have applied to the bureau and passed the review have been transferred to the ministry for approval and issuance of licenses. The bureau originally set the deadline for insurance brokers' application procedures on April 5. Recently, the bureau has decided to extend the deadline by two months in consideration of the incomplete procedures in other places.</p>
<h3>New Building Completion Ceremony of the Japanese Consulate General</h3>
<p>The new building of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, constructed on Huangpu Road, has been completed and is scheduled to hold a completion ceremony at 10:30 a.m. today. It will move in and start operating next month. The building has a very large area and is purely constructed of steel and concrete. It has a total of six floors and the style is particularly beautiful.</p>
<h3>Liang Shaojiu: Cannot be Hoarded in Fact</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous report that the total amount of Liang Shaojiu in Shanghai reached more than 80,000, the Shanghai Liang Shaojiu Association sent a letter stating that each member's wine shop is an agent for customer sales and rarely keeps inventory. In addition, the aroma, taste, and color of Liang Shaojiu are easily lost. In fact, it cannot be hoarded. The information contained in the report is entirely speculation by outsiders. Please correct it.</p>
<h3>Formal Announcement by the Japanese Embassy: Rice Prices Will Be Increased Starting Today. The price will be increased from 250 yuan to 300 yuan per stone.</h3>

<p>In order to effectively rectify public rice sales in the urban area and prevent malpractices, Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the Municipal Grain Management Bureau, posted a notice in various public rice sales offices in the urban area yesterday, which stated, "Since this bureau has been handling public rice sales, there have been reports from citizens accusing rice shops of fraudulent activities. However, when this bureau sends people to investigate, it is often difficult to find evidence of fraud because of the passage of time. In order to protect the interests of citizens, if citizens discover rice shops engaging in fraudulent activities in the future, they will be allowed to bring their documents to the bureau to report at that time. If the investigation by this bureau confirms the facts, they will be severely punished as a warning to others," and so on.</p>
<h3>Increase in Shipping Frequency Between Shanghai and South China</h3>
<p>According to the Commercial News Agency, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipping between Shanghai and Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou has only been able to operate once every month or so due to ship relations, which has caused great inconvenience to passengers. It is learned that the Japanese side recently discussed with the French Merchant Shipping Company to transfer a certain ship moored in Shanghai to a certain Japanese shipping company. Now that the two parties have reached a compromise, the transaction can be completed soon. It is reported that the ship has a tonnage of more than 4,000 tons and can carry both passengers and cargo, specializing in traveling to South China.</p>

<h3>Welcome the Toho Dance Troupe to Visit China</h3>
<p>Japan's most famous Toho Dance Troupe, in order to celebrate the return of the National Government, came to China for a visit. All the members of the group are excellent and highly accomplished individuals. Upon passing through this city, they briefly performed at yesterday's reception. In addition to observing the arts, we deeply feel that there is a deeper meaning in this. At present, under the common goal of striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan need to cooperate in political and economic aspects, and also need to communicate the feelings between the people of both countries. The art form is best suited to move people's emotions and has the most effective results. We have repeatedly pointed out that the true friendship between China and Japan can only be firmly established on the basis of the harmony of people's emotions. Therefore, the visit and performance of the Toho Dance Troupe will surely be able to accomplish this mission. Soon, the Japanese cultural envoys will also come to China. Their purpose and mission should also be here. It is seen that the feelings between the people of both countries will become more harmonious, and the degree of love will become more intimate.</p>

<h3>Investigate the Cost of Papermaking</h3>
<p>In order to understand the prices of products produced by Chinese paper mills in this port, the Price Investigation Section of the Public Works Bureau specifically convened a meeting of members of the Paper Industry Association yesterday and instructed them to report in detail the cost of papermaking and products so that the General Assembly could formulate and submit them to the authorities. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, all 17 Chinese paper mills in the city formally established a joint business office the day before yesterday and passed the draft articles of association, the main ones being: (1) Unifying production and sales matters; (2) Standardizing product prices to avoid speculation and manipulation; (3) Adjusting the supply and demand of the market. According to the person in charge of the industry association, Chinese paper mills have used waste paper as the only raw material since the allocation of paper pulp was stopped. They have now requested Japanese Ataka &amp; Co. to allocate it. The manager of Ataka &amp; Co. has already left for Japan to handle the matter and is expected to obtain a response soon.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Stamps Still Not Eliminated: Easy to Identify with Slight Attention</h3>
<p>The counterfeit stamps of one yuan and two jiao have not yet disappeared. However, with slight attention, they are easy to identify. The tower-side roads in the true stamp pattern are made into an arc, while the roads in the counterfeit stamp are straighter. In addition, the real stamp has burrs on the edges of the punched holes, while the holes in the counterfeit stamp are smoother. In the future, all merchants should pay attention to this at all times. If anyone is found selling counterfeit stamps, they should be immediately sent to the police station for strict handling in accordance with the law.</p>

For the oil received from the authorities this time, it is planned to implement a one-time purchase based on house tax tickets within a few days. It is expected to be a fact in the middle of next week. As for oil rationing per capita, it will be postponed to the next term because the procedures are complicated and difficult to issue at once.</p>

<p>Critical Essay</p>
<h3>Leaders in the Economic World</h3>
<p>From the perspective of the people, more advanced socio-economic conditions depend on the support and promotion of leaders in the economic world. Leaders in the economic world are not only leaders in economic endeavors but also leaders in economic thought. Their authority over the people is no less than that of political leaders.</p>
<p>Since leaders in the economic world are also leaders in economic thought, they must have a thorough understanding of the people's lives and their intentions. In other words, the strategies and methods they devise must be based on and adapted to the people's living environment and the demands of their intentions. One particularly important condition that leaders in the economic world must possess is rationalized thinking. All measures and actions, as long as they are permitted by the current local environment, do not harm the government, and benefit the people, can be suggested and contributed as much as possible, without worrying that the government will not accept them or that the people will not welcome them.</p>
<p>What we hope from leaders in the economic world is not only their participation in a certain department designated by the government but also their use of rationalized thinking to seek fundamental solutions to current social and economic problems. The so-called fundamental solution must concentrate thought and effort on (1) assisting the government in regulating finances to make them stronger, and (2) assisting the government in increasing production to make it orderly. Because with the fundamental solutions to the above two points, a fundamental solution to the entire people's livelihood problem will naturally be obtained.</p>
<p>Shanghai is known as a place where leaders in the economic world from all over the country are concentrated. It has now entered the initial stage of economic reform experimentation. It is believed that in the near future, the achievements of Shanghai's economic leaders will shine brightly in the economic world of the entire country and create a new record.</p>
<h3>Economic Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses National Government's Financial and Currency Policies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, traveled to Shanghai on the 18th with Mr. Tsushima, President of the North China Development Company. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 3:00 PM, he met with a group of reporters at the Cathay Hotel to discuss the National Government's financial and currency policies and commodity controls under the new circumstances. Among the points he made, the following are particularly important: the exchange rate between the reserve certificate and the Japanese yen will soon be implemented at a rate of 18 yen, the relationship between the reserve certificate and the joint bank notes will also be determined soon, and the rice purchasing agency will not be included under the subordinate organizations of the National Commercial Control Association for the time being, but will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Financial and Currency Issues</p>
<p>The issuance of reserve certificates increased significantly last autumn, but since this year, the withdrawal has been progressing smoothly. The amount issued in February and March has decreased somewhat, which is because the reserve certificates issued to the interior as purchasing funds are now gradually flowing back. In order to promote the integration of military notes and reserve certificates, the amount of reserve certificates issued will be increased again according to needs in the future. However, this is not for inflation. At the same time as the military notes and reserve certificates are integrated, the exchange rate between the reserve certificates and the Japanese yen will be implemented at a rate of 18 yen. As for the relationship between the reserve certificates and the joint bank notes, the government and various parties are currently studying it, and a concrete decision should be made soon. Recently, many small banks have been established in Shanghai without the approval of the National Government, which is sufficient to disrupt the National Government's financial control. Therefore, it is planned to take decisive measures.</p>
<p>Commodity Control Issues</p>
<p>The commodity movement control has been eased this time, and the control affairs have also been decided to be entrusted to the National Commercial Control Association, a private autonomous organization. Since the announcement of the commodity movement restrictions, prices have generally fallen, which is gratifying. However, the National Commercial Control Association has just been established, and its organization is not yet complete. Therefore, it is planned to expedite its completion, complete its subordinate organizations, and establish commodity control organizations. However, rice purchases will not be placed under the jurisdiction of the Control Association for the time being, but will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department of the National Government. In the future, after the organization of the Control Association is complete, it will be placed under the Control Association again.</p>
<p>Financial Issues</p>
<p>The abolition of extraterritoriality will be implemented in the near future, and the issue of recovering taxation rights is also included. However, the National Government's budget for this year has not considered the increased tax revenue resulting from the abolition of extraterritoriality. There is also a plan to issue food treasury bonds (tentatively named) to raise funds for rice purchases, which is also being planned. As for the issuance of lottery tickets, it is also being considered and may be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Policy Companies in China Change Basic Policies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to Domei News Agency, Mr. Sonoda, a director of the Tokyo branch of the Central China Development Company, revealed to reporters yesterday at the Broadway Mansion that the basic policies of Japanese policy companies in China will undergo major changes. He said that the capital, materials, and natural resources of these policy companies will henceforth be gradually supplied from the Central China area. This new policy for the 1943 fiscal year is the opposite of the past policy, as in the past, the capital and materials of these companies have all relied on Japan. Mr. Sonoda recently arrived in Shanghai to confer with officials of the Central China Development Company headquarters and financial leaders here regarding the future trends of Japanese policy companies in China. He said that the activities of these companies next year will focus on the production of military supplies and the development of wartime industries. Although the business policies of these companies have undergone various reforms since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the activities of these companies in the middle of last year still progressed smoothly. The development process in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas has also progressed smoothly, and the important natural resources of Central China are now being developed smoothly according to plan. The budgets of the companies are compiled with the main purpose of developing important natural resources and cultivating Japan's war power, and have been approved by the Cabinet Planning Board after careful review by the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Since the Establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the City's Commerce Has Been Moving Towards the Right Track. The Board of Directors and Supervisors Continued to Hold Meetings Yesterday. News is Centralized for Handling by the Secretary-General.</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has been working very hard on its affairs. Yesterday, it continued to hold a joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, and in addition to resolving various important cases, it also stipulated that future news releases will be handled centrally by the Secretary-General. All manuscripts must be reviewed and stamped by the Secretary-General and a copy retained before being issued, in order to ensure accuracy and prudence.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the city's commercial activities will shift from abnormal hoarding to normal trade. Currently, goods returning from Shanghai to the interior, except for the eleven items that require a permit from the Commercial Control Association, such as automotive parts, petroleum, various machinery, communication equipment materials, metal products, medicines, rubber, cotton yarn, candles, matches, and soap, and incoming items such as rice, wheat, and beans, are allowed to be moved out and transported in freely. Therefore, Shanghai's commerce can move towards the right track in the future. In recent days, some merchants have already shipped goods such as cigarettes to the interior for sale, and some non-controlled goods from the interior have also been transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the prices of goods in the interior and Shanghai will gradually stabilize.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Registration Files Will Soon Be Handed Over to the Commercial Control Association for Handling.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The National Commercial Control Association was officially established on the 15th of this month. However, because the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet handed over the relevant files for material registration, it is not possible to handle the issuance of material movement permits. At the first meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, it was resolved that: (1) all files of inventory registration from all industries held by the Shanghai Municipal Council should be handed over to the Association for receipt; (2) all industries should complete inventory registration before the 23rd; (3) before the establishment of the general membership meeting, all industries should automatically suspend movement; (4) before the establishment of the general membership meeting, the above measures should be communicated to all industries by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Chinese merchants and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Japanese merchants, respectively. The Association will notify the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the above measures, and notify all relevant trade associations for joint information. As for the files for issuing material movement permits by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they will soon be transferred to the Commercial Control Association for receipt and handling. It is reported that various trade associations, such as the rubber industry, have complied with the order and notified their members to collect registration forms from their respective associations and register before the deadline, and to automatically suspend movement before completing registration, in order to protect their own rights and interests. Otherwise, if they remain wait-and-see, delay registration, or move without authorization and encounter obstacles, or even prohibition, the trade associations will not be responsible. As for the names of registered products, the associations will notify them separately.</p>
<h3>Agency Exchange of Tickets Between Two Banks</h3>

<p>The China Cotton Industry Bank, which currently has a temporary office at 17 Fuzhou Road, officially opened on the 18th. Chairman of the Board Lu Shou'an, Standing Director Wang Xinzai, and Manager Zhang Danqiu are in charge of operations, and all are cotton merchants from Shanghai and Hankou.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Proclamation: Measures for the Movement of Wartime Materials</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Realization of Autonomous Economic Control</h3>
<p>After the transfer of material movement control in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to the National Government, the National Government, in order to adapt to the times, handed it over to private autonomous control. The National Commercial Control Association is a private organization dedicated to this task. We should have a deep understanding of the great significance of the complete transfer of economic control to the Chinese side. At the same time, we cannot help but admire the National Government's wise measures in being able to make the determination to entrust it to economic organizations for autonomous control. The new control mechanism will surely facilitate the flow of materials, restore Shanghai's productivity, and at the same time achieve economic self-sufficiency in the interior. Its great contribution to establishing China's wartime economy need not be elaborated.</p>
<p>The economic control exercised by the National Commercial Control Association is autonomous control. We must first pay attention to this point. The lower-level organization of the Control Association should be prepared immediately. We have not seen its actual affairs, but we are confident that it is an agency representing the general will of the business community. The business community will surely appreciate the government's hard work and handle economic control affairs, which will be stronger and more effective than any control by force. The future is bright and predictable. Moreover, there is no lack of precedents for autonomous control by commercial organizations in China, so there is no need to worry unnecessarily. The Control Association is not a new attempt for the first time. The Chinese economic community has often done this kind of work during important periods in the past, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>However, the Control Association has another epoch-making significance in its content, that is, Japanese merchants participate in the association's internal affairs and assist in economic activities on completely equal terms. Private cooperation is most important, which we often advocate. And the true private cooperation is only possible with friendly cooperation on equal terms, and the Control Association can do this, which is gratifying. Another point worth mentioning is that Japanese merchants are able to actively cooperate and adapt to the new situation on equal terms. It is fortunate for the new system in the future.</p>
<p>However, the current problems of the Control Association are very serious. In order to open up a new life for the economy of Central China and cultivate war power, we must make the greatest efforts. If the direction of application is wrong, it will be tantamount to suicide for the new China. Fortunately, the Association has many capable talents such as Tang Shoumin and Wu Zhenxi, and also has the assistance of financial giants. Autonomous control can definitely be smoothly promoted without error. Finally, it should be noted that during the process of the Association's preparation, there will inevitably be some changes in the financial world. Perhaps with the smooth flow of circulation, the price of a certain kind of commodity will rise once. If people are surprised and doubt this transition phase because of the current phenomenon, this can be said to be a misunderstanding of not distinguishing reality and not understanding the principle of control. We should have a heart to support the Control Association and should not make hasty judgments. We must clearly recognize it and allow it to grow. Only it is the root of maintaining China and Japan.

<h3>French Concession Restaurants and Vegetable Shops Should Collect Special Donations: Single Receipts Should Be Kept for One Year</h3>

In addition, the owners or managers of merchants should safely preserve various account books, bills, and duplicate copies of invoices issued to customers for at least one year.' Violators of the above provisions will be severely punished without leniency, this proclamation."</p>

I believe that in order for the Chinese and Japanese people to seek thorough and sincere cooperation and defeat the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, they must have a world view of East Asian familism and clear away the individualistic view of selfishness. My purpose is to promote the world view, eliminate the individualistic view, seek a fusion of the thoughts of the people of the two countries, and realize coexistence and co-prosperity."
