<p>社評</p>
<h3>民意上達</h3>
<p>八月一日，是上海市政歸於一元之日，是「租界」永成歷史名詞之日。全國人民，尤其是上海市民，對於大上海市新生建設的動態與前途，抱着無限的關切與期待。因為上海是中國的大都市，國際交通的門戶，全國政治經濟的重心，一舉一動的良窳，足為國際人士觀瞻所繫，而社會風氣對於全國各地發生影響作用。所以，我們在上海市民的立塲，在期望上海前途繁榮與安定的觀點，對於接收租界，抱着銜動的歌頌歡欣，或是消極的冷眼旁，均非應有的態度。我們必須認淸，建設新上海是每一個市民的責任。歌頌歡欣同難成事，冷眼旁也非所宜。惟有以積極的督促的態度，才能促使市政的完善。我們知道，政府原是為人民服務的，政府的措施，當然依照人民的需要與利益為根據。但是，政府難免有時耳目不周，考察未妥，因此有未能盡符人民需要與利益的措施，在此塲合，人民就須用積極的督促的態度，提供改善意見。人民意見既然合理，政府也必俯順輿惰，樂為採納。</p>
<p>我們肯定的抱具上述見解，認為惟有人民與政府衷心的打成一片，才能發揮共同協力的效率，促成理想的上海建設。而如何促成人民與政府打成一片，這一任務，我們輿論界不自卑地願以全力承乏，同時，我們且認為這是無可諉辭的義務。我們想先從溝通官民意見入手，因此，在半個月內，我們連續啓事，為大上海市設施，微求市民意見，啓事中說：「大上海市之新生建設，關係上海前途以及市民福利，至為重大。因此市政之動向，自值市民注意，而設施之良窳，在民意機關未經成立以前，市民亦當以至誠表示意見，木報對此願盡市民喉舌之資，特闢地位披露市民建議，反映民意，自九月份起，以每月一日為發表之期。凡市民對於市政設施各方面之動態，優劣進退，繕成文宇，　選披露，如有守密之必要者，亦常　轉市政當局，以備　考。」自徵集以還，承市民踴躍投書，計得二百餘件，從此更足證明市民關心市政之殷切。我們在分析之前，願將市民諸君之誠意，獻給市政常局。</p>
<p>我們會將收到的市民意見，詳細的考察與比較，第一，凡是有關市政各部門的意見鉅細細靡遺，可見市民對市政認識水凖的向上與普遍。第二，意見集中之點，厥為民生問題，尤以民食問題爲論點中心，足證古人說的「民以食為天」，確是經騐之談，我們始終認為糧食問題是民生問題中最重要的一點，糧食問題是今日最嚴重的問題，並未言之過甚。其次，有關民生問問題者如平抑物價，取締囤積；執行租賃條例，增建平尺住宅，改進交通與公共衛生；厲行節約。有關行政設施者，如厲行廉潔政治與整飭敎育·，減輕與劃一捐稅；改善公務員待遇；强化保甲；興修水利；根絕烟賠復與南市；設立公共文化國體等等。有的是根據事實發爲適合現狀的改善主張；有的是參酌理論擬成的具體計劃；其中不乏頗具價值的優秀見地。我們原期盡量發表，祇以本報篇幅過窄，事實上未能博採，心餘力絀，這應向市民諸君與市政當局同致歉意的。今天是九月一日，是接收租界後第一個週月，除在本報第四版擇尤連載兩天外，並將篇幅較長的移在申報月刊發表。一部分意見，且將彙集送呈當局參考。</p>
<p>我們早已說過，所謂市民意見，是切身體騐的，老老實實的話，所以，不取空論，不重修辭，不嫌煩複。當然，切身問題，頗有人人相同之處，我們更不能視為平淡的老生常談，我們應注視問題的嚴重性與普遍性，愈常見的事，愈為人所忽略，這是我們觀察民意應有的態度。</p>
<p>此外，我們仍將不辭煩厭的提出糧合問題，這一個眾意僉同的問題，無論官方民間，決不能等閑視之。昨天報載消息，糧食的收購配給事宜，將由全國商業統制總會接辦，該會籌備組設專辦機構，人選內定。我們連日對此問題的竭誠呼籲，今能見實施有期，足微政府俯順順輿情，重視民生的至意。古人一糧「前車之覆，後車之鑑」。我們對於今後糧食收購配給之措置，務期一反前愆，澈底革新。因此，我們以同樣的誠意，徵求市民對於糧食問題的意見，諸如收購配給方面種種利弊的比較，尤以列舉過去弊端事實，然後提出適應的改善對策，在下月的今天，彙選發表，提供有關當局參考。我們願意繼續不斷的作此民意上達工作，以待正式民意機構成立而止。深信凡關心上海建設的官民雙方，均所贊同的吧！</p>

<h3>新幾內亞島方面　日軍三月來戰果　敵死傷五千毀機三百餘架</h3>
<p>東京卅一日中央社電　日大本營卅一日下午三時發表：　新幾內亞島薩拉摩亞附近之我軍部隊，在加米達姆·姆保·諾索灣之綫，自六月三日以來，對在優勢空軍援助下，由諾索潛及瓦屋附近前進之敵軍展開邀擊，予以大打學後，現匿於薩拉摩亞附近地點激戰中，在此期間，敵軍之損害死傷約在五千六百人以上。　新幾內亞方面我軍航空部隊與陸上部隊相協力，曾進攻培諾培諾。夥布巴等敵軍航空基地，並邀擊來襲之敵機。現仍繼續激烈作戰中，在此期間共擊落敵機三五八架，內未證實者五十三架，我方損失一百〇三架。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三十一日中央社電　新幾內亞薩拉摩亞地區之戰事，似已日趨猛烈，日軍曾予反軸心軍以極大之損害。據新金山來電，合眾社前綫特派員三十日對該方面之戰况報稱：薩拉摩亞之反軸心軍因遭日軍之猛烈反攻，過去二三日內曾不得不自若干地點後退。</p>
<h3>日軍三都澳登陸　確保海洋治安　並具有甚深之歷史意義</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　日本海軍降戰隊於廿八日在福建省三都澳登陸成功，現正積極掃蕩殘敵中。三都澳為中國海岸綫福建省東海水城內之一最優天然良港，位於三沙灣內之三都島南岸。全島周圍二十餘里，峯巒起伏，竹樹叢茂，頗饒勝景。澳內水深波平，海輸巨艦，停泊其問，安若堂奧。前水為一小村。清光緒廿四年義大利要求租借，遂日闢商埠。廿五年作輸茶出口專用港，惟背面山嶺環繞，貿易殊難發展。然因該地面臨台灣海峽，而成軍事要地。美人曾在光緒廿六年計劃設置海軍貯炭所、後因日方反對而中止。今美方欲圖以之作潛艇基地，即遭日軍迅予粉碎其企謀。此對確保大東亞海洋治安意義，極為重大。同時日軍一鼓作氣，即可登陸閩屬寗德縣，用作進窺福州攻略前之先驅。此對完成中國全面和平及擊滅英美，完遂大東亞戰爭上，更具有甚深之歷史意義，故其戰局發展，頗可期待。</p>

<h3>谷萩報導部長　昨發表談話</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，三十一日發表談話如次：</p>
<p>渝政權根據武器貸與法，已自英國借入龐大款額，即以渝方治下土地資源甚至以國民皆充美國之奴　，亦難償請　方借款，且購入大掛物資，結果徒負莫大之欠債。前於昭和卞一年（民國二十五年）即中日事變勃發前，渝方自美國所借之款，除與武器袋與法有關者外，即已有三千一百九十四萬三千美元，然自大東亞戰爭發生後，（即昭和十七年氏），已達十億四千七百七十四萬三千美元（以舊法幣　算為二百零九億五干四百八十六萬元），井中約五億元係以直接救濟渝方財政爲目的發行之美金公債，共次根據武器貸與法輸渝之物資，據泰晤十報所載稱，自昭和十六年至十八年二月　渝物資已達十餘億美元，惟確實運抵渝方之數量不明，關於武器貸與法規定之償還法，亦有問題，蓋如根據規約所定，係戰後美國大總統認為對於美國或西半球之防　以　　他為美國所視為有用者，以之有償還之代價，此意即凡物資甚至土地鐵路以及其他之利權，由美國方面決定後，皆可充償還代價。現渝方已為英美遭受莫大之犧牲，尤以人員損失爲共，而美國對此毫無同情之意。據八月中旬渝參政會會議決謂，英美在中國放棄治外法權後，外國向中國投資，大有裹足之傾向。然中國因將來及現在必需積極開發，故頗為歡迎外國之投實。因此政府方面已決定予以絕對之保證。並公布有關之辦法，所謂絕對之保證。不外欲將中國之統制權給典外國資本家，亦即渝方為挽救一時之計，竟不惜將中國西億民眾出賣與英美資本家之手，淪方縱能以有利之條約結束戰事，而為償淸於戰事期間所借之價務，恐亦須將全國之土地貫獻與英美。設東亞已無日本存在，則英美以此債務然根據，將不如提出如何無理之難題。彼時渝方雖以戰事期間所蒙極大之犧牲。而企圖賠償，則絕對不可能云。</p>

<h3>奎貝克會議與　英美蘇之間的懸案</h3>
<p>奎貝克英美會談的中心題目，除應付義大利政變後歐洲新戰局以外，尙有其他許多問題，而英美蘇三國的調整問題，似依然成為議論的中心。羅邱可　足當事國的輿論至何程度？卡薩勃朗加會談以來的英蘇　案可調整至何程度？不用說，自是本會談的主要議題。以下試介紹紐約泰晤士報听記英美蘇懸　的經緯及性質。</p>
<p>第二戰綫問題</p>
<p>關於這問題，紐約泰晤士報稱：「蘇聯要求在北法沿岸實施直接且大規模的作戰。」八月五日的蘇聯眞理報轉載「戰爭與勞動階級」雜誌的記載，蘇聯所確定的把第二戰綫的意義告訴英美，文中說：</p>
<p>「在本年一月的卡薩勃朗加會談中，決定了本年九個月問英美聯軍的軍事行動計劃，其中雖也包含着第二戰終，但九個月將近告終，而第二戰終尙未結成。把到今日為止的戰績來看，英美軍尙未與德軍眞正衝突。英美辯護說第二戰綫遷延的理由為　歐洲要塞，　船舶問題未解決，　侵入為冒險之舉。但歐洲要塞是想像的產物，船舶問題，由於美國造船的增加，英美軍北非登陸及西西里之戰的經騐，業已解決。而侵入的　險，在戰爭的第一年可以這樣說，在本年已不通用了。</p>
<p>對此，紐約泰晤士報辯稱：「英美若沒有實行上述作戰的決心，則有何商議的必要？」這第二戰綫問題，在此次英美會談之前，英美蘇之間的隔閡，業已有相當的距離了。</p>
<p>波蘭與巴爾　幹三國</p>
<p>今春的蘇波國境糾紛，英美蘇之問，以大西洋憲章為中必露骨地表示了對小國見解的對立。當時邱吉爾說：「戰後英·美·蘇三國應互相協調，設置與三國之崇高且永久的利害相一致的，由許多國家　，國家聯合所組成的歐洲會議。然則在戰局的現狀下來討論國境綫眞是笨事。」於是這問題就這樣留下來未解決。此次會談中，如其要調整英美蘇的政治，首先將為具有現實性的論題。紐約泰晤士報稱：</p>
<p>「英美常以猜疑的目光向着蘇聯，蘇聯目為英美用這些國家來包圍蘇聯。」</p>
<p>這證明蘇波國境間題依然那樣深刻地對立着。英國綜合性的權威雜誌「十九世紀及其以後」，在其六月號中以此問題向蘇聯大胆攻擊，而招致了蘇聯的憤怒。該誌的論旨謂：</p>
<p>「從波蘭　去了其東部，這在波塵是生死的大事。那就是說波關喪失了領土的一半，人民的三分之一。可是在蘇聯方面，由於合併而所得的實　為微小。蘇波糾紛不是孤立的現象。蘇聯的對南國政策亦用同樣手段，蘇聯把南國的米哈維維區將軍當作薛可斯基的存在。蘇聯占領東部波蘭之後，與捷克的喀爾巴阡，露孫尼亞接壤，該地與　伽里西亞同樣存在着　多烏克關系居民，所　蘇聯合併的主張。頗有根據，而應說解蘇聯的眞意。」</p>
<p>從此看來，波蘭問題對英國包含着重大的利害關係，所以英國輿論露骨地集中猜疑的眼光於蘇聯，更不待紐約，泰晤士報的指摘了。</p>
<p>會談的結果</p>
<p>綜上所述，英美蘇間對立的眞相，在打倒德國的軍事目的上，完全一致，毫無異論。但關於三國間之政治目的，則暴露深刻的對立，於是此次的英美會談，以上述諸問題爲中心，在政治調整上，如其要成就何種發展的方途，至少應為第二戰綫的實現，東歐問題的讓步等以滿足史太林的互相主義外交。沒有蘇聯參加的英美會談，　消問題上，會談的成果不致有明白的表示。與戰局的推移有關的三國間今後的交涉，極堪注目。（翔：譯自八月廿五日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>岡崎部長談稱嚴禁逃避收買</p>
<p>（中央社訊）日本大使館上海事務所岡崎總務部長於日昨招待中國記者席上，對目下中日兩國當局收買棉紗棉布問題，發表重要談話，岡崎部長首謂關於收買棉紗棉布一事，經中日座當局協力推行之下，巳獲良好效果。但亦有一部份商人藐視法令，私托運輸公司秘密運往各地，以期避免收買當局者，關於此種違法情事，一經發覺，不但須受嚴重懲罰，且當局隨時可將收買品域擴展至紗布所能逃避之地區。故商人即使能將紗布遝出上海，在其他各地仍將被當局收買也。他如棉布字號連日有將布匹截斷出售者，當局方面亦將嚴予飭査，至於紗布他日實施配給後　當局方而決儘量分配於華中各地，因此有人顧慮此項紗布是否將流入內地。岡崎部長則稱，對於此點，並不如何重要，因中日兩當局此次收買紗布，旨在促進物資交流，通貨穩定，以期抑平物價，安定民生，故即有一部份流入內地，亦可藉此加　該地人民，同時安定其生活，故並無特別顧慮之必要。</p>

<p>民意上達大上海市建設市民提供意見　改進新上海市政意見  姚芍生　　特輯之一　　上　租界收囘以後，政府應該處處表現出「與　更始一的精神，現在趁中報徵求市民　大上海市政　施意見的機會，特地把我所感到的　點寫將出來，希望當局和市民諸君指教。　　食糧農給　　「民以食爲天」，這已經是一句「天經地義」的話了。過去戶口米的配給和採辦事宜，是由友邦軍配方面負責主持的，辦理情形尙稱美滿。但是一經移轉我國官方手中後，採辦方面，似乎頗見遲緩，因此每期戶口米的配給也顯得迎緩。又因採辦數量有限，口米的配給量也在被减少之中。起初只得一升，這期又是只有半升，在以前，二升尙且不夠，一升又怎樣夠呢？還有一點，戶口米的價格，也常在被提高之中。米是一切主要物品之首，官定米價既被提高，當然結果使黑市米價猖獗起來了。非但米如此，影響所及，其他物品也隨之上漲，政府這種舉措，在政府自身儘可揆爲不得已，豈知這種舉措，產生多穩惡果，這決不是賢明的當局所宜出之吧。假使政府當局對「抑平物價，安定民生」確有決心的話，那末請趕快增加配給戶口米數量，依我觀察，假定一升米每人至省可用二天，最好每十天須配給五升，同時减低售價，如能切實實行，則物價不抑平自抑平，民生也眞的安定了。　　納捐問題　　以前和界時代，市民每月或隨時應納的捐甚多，幾乎無一不要捐，而且捐額又在隨時增加之中，這實在是外人壓榨中國人民脂膏的苛政。現在租界既已收同，那末，應該替中國同胞解除這種萬鈞之的重枷鎖束縳才好。我以爲政府當局應該把以前外人統治租界時代的種種捐稅趕快重新調整，何者當納，何者應廢，何者宜减少捐額。我以爲像「損稅」一項，應該有個分別，不能　樣東四要納捐。凡是日用必需物品，如食油·糖·　·肥皂·火柴……：等，統應取消　售捐，反之如烟·酒以及化妝品等不屬必需品範圍內的東西，則仍當納捐。娛樂如電影·京　和跳　等，不妨加重捐額，一方面亦可限制人民不必要的消費。　　警政方面　　我想地方上用警察，無非爲的要維持治安，使人民安居樂業　　於警察的考勤，應以他們維持治安的程度作爲標準。租界收囘以後，在改革警政之下，這種情形，希望予以考慮。　　公共衛生　　以前外人統治租界行政時代，雖然頗多弊政，但有一點却是不可埋沒的，那就是對於界內公共衛生辦理相當認眞·種痘·打針以及檢査食物不必說，就是馬路里衖的淸潔，也頗注意。但一自租界收囘以後，竟有幾處里衖居民，（尤其是第八區居民）將垃圾糞　任意　倒，這固然是居民的不是，然市衛生當局職掌全市衛生，也是責無旁貸，當然應該繼續的努力，依我的愚見，爲了要鼓勵市民對公共淸潔事宜的注意起見，可由當局規定辦法，在每月的若干時日中舉行里衖和街道淸潔競賽，此事可責成保甲機構協助進行，並由保甲長擔任評判，將每次評定結果呈報當局，分別獎懲。　　淫書問題　　據我的觀察，在各個角落裏的報攤上關於這類的嘗本頗爲充斥，對於善良風俗道德，實在是一種很大的妨害。假使說鴉片賭博足以戕害人的身體，無疑地，這類書就足以毒害人的精神思想，我希望收同租界以後的我國市政當局，應立即從事取締，將已有的許多淫書，一概沒收銷燬，並防止同類惡書的繼續出現，以拯救人們的精神和思想吧。蒭蕘之獻  水兆熊　　　租界的收同，是中國歷史上的一大轉變，也是一個新的局而的開始。許多事情擺在我們而前，亟待我們去做。關於工商業方面，尤其站在同業公會的立塲上，我們有不得不作芻蕘之獻者。用是不揣胃昧，敢貢其一得之愚。　　第一，我們希望當局博採民意，加倍注意民問的獻議。在這百事待舉的今日，一切施政更應以「民視民聽」爲準則，而這可以代表「民視民聽」的所在，固然希望有一個健全的民意機構以爲集思廣益之助。可是像　樣一個「民視民聽」的機構，並非咄嗟可辦。在現階段下，我們以爲勢非暫時利用實際擁有羣衆的不可。同業公會一種機構，牠是業的組合，以各該業的領導份子為主體，　合許多廠商於一體，足爲大部分民意的代表　政府若欲勤求民意，必須處處採擇同業公會的意見。如欲進而求形式上的統一，謀政府與民問更爲接近起見，那末在政府指導之下，以各個主要同業公會爲主體。另外再聘請其他方而的專才，成立一個代表民意以及工商界利益的參政機關，正是刻不容緩之舉。　　第二，我們們得經濟統制政策，不僅在戰時　予提倡，即在平時，亦　繼續推行。現今世界各國，無論其為交戰國或中立國，都一樣採行統制政策，愈是統制得妥善的國家，其國力必越強盛，中國在連年戰爭之中，尤其現在是屬於參戰國之一員·其需要統制經濟更無待煩言了。但統制經濟決不是空口白話所能做得出來的，必定要有正確的根據，要獲得這種根據，惟有從調査統計入手。政府對於調查統計工作，也可算得厲行不懈了，然其成效甚微，此中原因實由於以往對於該項工作，冬偏重於情極方面，如澈查囤積。調査物資等等，對於民生，自屬有益，但　可貴的，還在如何謀生產之開拓，貨銷之暢盛。此則必須就現在　商原料製品之　銷情形，及機器用電之　量，作實地調查統計工作，使工商界整個而目，陳列於當政者之前，俾謀爲改進之參攷。所以調査統計的目的，不僅在尋求工商界的病態而作對症下藥之準備，尤望能調護營養以爲經濟建設之肇端。還有一點，單由政府方面做調查統計工作，雖不缺乏人力物力，然總不免偏重理論不切實際，若由各同業公會中業內人會同來做，再由政府集其大成，定能駕　就熟，可收事半功倍之效。跑馬廳改建公園  王弼臣　　查競馬塲（即跑馬廳），位於市中心區，面積寬敞，空氣淸新，平日用爲競馬，已不符市政原則，今幸租界交還，而政府亦有刷新市政的動向，若將此競馬陽闢改爲公園，使數百萬市民，同沾實益，於衛生方面，得益非淺。同時化無用爲有用，足壯市容的觀瞻。務希常局爲市民健康着想，早日實現，敢貢芻議，佇盼採納。　　一八兩區電車銜接上海小市民上海小市民一八兩區電車銜接　　爲求便利市民交通，本人主張第一區二路電車可與第八區七路電車銜接起來，變成　路路綫，分北行車南行車行駛。　　辦法　　　北行車從善鐘路海格路起　沿海格路向北新舖有軌路軌至靜安寺路，與原有軌這接通。　南行車從靜安寺廟門起折南沿　格路新鋪有軌路軌至善鐘路，與原有軌道接通。　第八區從霞飛路善鐘路口起，至善鐘路底改成來去雙軌　　行駛　　北行車起點　安寺，延原第一區二路電車路綫，至外洋經橋，穿過愛多亞路入　八區外灘，至法大馬路折西，延原第八區七路電車路綫至善鐘路底，折入海格路，囘到靜安寺。南行車起點靜安寺廟門折南，沿海　路拆入善　　延第八區七路電車路綫至外灘，改折北進，入第一區，延二路電車原路錢返靜安寺　　取締「白相人」　　上海社會的白相人，影響社會的法紀民風，是很大的張金海事件，也是白相人作惡的一個例子。希望今後的布政當局先把白相人集散的地方和集　的時間加以正確調査，予以敎化工作。（紀逢村）寶貴的建議（一）　　爲了篇幅關係，未能將各界寶貴的長篇建議，全部刊出，除能分別在日報月報刊佈者外，這裏只能摘錄一部分，我們謹向作者和讀者致其歉意。編者附誌　　陳建夫君上海之都市計　問題約五千言，要點，　建都市鐵這，　建浦江橋，　建綠地及運動塲，　解決排水問題，　建設衛生，　平均發展產業。　　季淵君建設上海三要點　　市的建設分市容市政兩方面，　「生」的解決，分衣食住行四點，　「人」的教育，分敎育文化兩點，叙述周詳，　　黃垂聖君大上海市政之新設施及其應有實勝之工作分　市政統一　市政管理　堅固財政　實行公務人員之甄拔任用制度　重整市塲　加強治安　健全保甲　改良敎育　提高文化　社會工作逐項闡明，意見詳密。　　陸　廷君改良上　敎育的管見　分　改良敎材，從增選敎材編印新　一入手，　改良學校，　校組織檢査師資兩項，　改良待遇，主增加束修，立論精確。　　買觀軍君上海市政的設施主張增口米，减捐稅，禁烟賭，限物價，助善團，改路名等項。李阿毛　衛生信箱投函詢問病症寄白克路二五〇號　　（陸德明問）坐起時眼前發黑，何故（答）貧血也，內府或注射肝精。　　（王德　問）　　　並器何處售（答）理療器械行，但效能不知。　　（高　哲問）頭昏腦脹，記憶薄弱，乏力失眠，宜服何藥（答）三　片　　（兪家駿問）略（答）除寄生蟲之藥均有毒，非經醫師處方，不能配到　　（王國健問）略（答）　不一定狐臭因狐臭不限定在運動後　藥房有售　　（趙培君問）頭暈目眩背痛，用何藥（答）可注射英得蒙及補力多針藥　　（何國棟問）略（答）當繼續服完，每片約五六角，可詢問九福公司。　　（郭頌習問）略（答）　用錏汞軟膏　尿垢宜洗。　　（王玉書問）略（答）仍可哺乳，並無餘毒也。　　（馮山立問）略（答）　未斷根，有傳染毒性可能　是的　有關係，從速請醫診治。　　（崔納海問）患膈氣，肚雖飢，食即吐，如何辦法？（答）宜請醫診治，或注射及內服樂　努食了。　　（談士英問）略（答）速戒惡習，注射補力多針藥。　　（陳海慶問）略（答）遺精服英得蒙，每片約五六角。</p>

        <h1>1943.09.01</h1>
<h3>Reaching the Public</h3>
<p>August 1st marked the day Shanghai's municipal administration was unified, and the day the term "concession" became a historical relic. The people of the entire nation, especially the citizens of Shanghai, hold boundless concern and anticipation for the new construction and future prospects of the Great Shanghai Municipality. This is because Shanghai is China's metropolis, the gateway to international transportation, and the center of national politics and economy. Its every move, good or bad, is observed by international figures, and its social atmosphere has an impact on all parts of the country. Therefore, from the standpoint of Shanghai citizens, and with the perspective of hoping for Shanghai's prosperity and stability, neither celebratory glorification nor passive indifference is the appropriate attitude towards the takeover of the concessions. We must understand that building a new Shanghai is the responsibility of every citizen. Celebratory glorification alone cannot achieve anything, nor is indifference desirable. Only with a proactive and supervisory attitude can we promote the improvement of municipal administration. We know that the government exists to serve the people, and its policies should naturally be based on the needs and interests of the people. However, the government inevitably has blind spots and incomplete investigations. Thus, there may be measures that do not fully meet the needs and interests of the people. In this case, the people must adopt a proactive and supervisory attitude to offer suggestions for improvement. If the people's opinions are reasonable, the government will surely heed public sentiment and be happy to adopt them.</p>
<p>We firmly hold the above view, believing that only through sincere collaboration between the people and the government can we achieve efficient cooperation and facilitate the construction of an ideal Shanghai. As for how to promote a unified front between the people and the government, we in the journalistic field are willing to take on this task with all our strength, without any reservations. At the same time, we believe that this is an undeniable obligation. We want to start by bridging the gap between officials and the public. Therefore, over the past half month, we have continuously published announcements seeking opinions from citizens on the facilities of the Great Shanghai Municipality. The announcement stated: "The new construction of the Great Shanghai Municipality is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the direction of municipal administration deserves the attention of citizens. And, before the establishment of public opinion organs, citizens should express their opinions with utmost sincerity. This newspaper is willing to serve as the voice of the citizens, and has specially opened a space to disclose citizens' suggestions and reflect public opinion, starting from September, with the first day of each month as the publication date. Citizens are invited to draft written opinions on the dynamics, merits, demerits, progress, and regress of all aspects of municipal facilities, which will be selectively published. If there is a need for confidentiality, they will also be confidentially forwarded to the municipal authorities for their consideration." Since the solicitation, we have received enthusiastic submissions from citizens, totaling over two hundred items, which further proves the citizens' eagerness to care about municipal administration. Before the analysis, we would like to present the sincerity of all citizens to the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>We have carefully examined and compared the citizens' opinions received. First, the opinions cover all departments of municipal administration, large and small, which demonstrates the improvement and universality of citizens' understanding of municipal administration. Second, the focal point of the opinions is on livelihood issues, especially the issue of food for the people, which is the central argument, proving that the ancients' saying "food is the paramount necessity of the people" is indeed based on experience. We have always believed that the food issue is the most important aspect of the people's livelihood, and that the food issue is the most serious issue today, which is not an overstatement. Next, regarding issues related to the people's livelihood, such as stabilizing prices, cracking down on hoarding, enforcing leasing regulations, building more affordable housing, improving transportation and public health, and practicing frugality. Regarding administrative facilities, such as enforcing clean governance and rectifying education, reducing and standardizing taxes, improving the treatment of civil servants, strengthening the Baojia system, building water conservancy projects, eradicating opium and gambling in the Nanshi district, and establishing public cultural institutions, and so on. Some are based on facts and propose improvements suitable for the current situation; others are concrete plans based on theoretical considerations. Among them, there are many excellent insights of considerable value. We originally planned to publish as much as possible, but due to the limited space of this newspaper, we were unable to adopt them all, which is a matter of regret. We should apologize to all citizens and the municipal authorities for this. Today is September 1st, the first month after the takeover of the concessions. In addition to selecting and publishing the best articles on page four of this newspaper for two consecutive days, we will also publish the longer articles in the "Shen Bao Monthly." Some of the opinions will also be compiled and submitted to the authorities for reference.</p>
<p>We have said before that the so-called citizens' opinions are based on personal experience and are honest words. Therefore, we do not take empty theories, do not emphasize rhetoric, and do not mind being repetitive. Of course, personal issues often have similarities, and we cannot regard them as bland platitudes. We should pay attention to the seriousness and universality of the problem. The more common things are, the more easily they are overlooked. This is the attitude we should have when observing public opinion.</p>
<p>In addition, we will continue to raise the issue of food, a problem that everyone agrees on, and that neither the government nor the people can ignore. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the procurement and distribution of food will be taken over by the National Commercial Control Association, and that the association's preparatory team has established a special agency, with personnel already designated. We have been sincerely appealing to this issue for days, and now we see that the implementation is imminent, which is a testament to the government's willingness to listen to public opinion and attach importance to the people's livelihood. As the ancients said, "The overturned cart ahead is a warning to the cart behind." Regarding the future measures for the procurement and distribution of food, we must reverse the previous mistakes and thoroughly reform. Therefore, with the same sincerity, we are soliciting citizens' opinions on the food issue, such as comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various aspects of procurement and distribution, especially listing the facts of past abuses, and then proposing appropriate improvement strategies. On this day next month, we will compile and publish selected articles for reference by the relevant authorities. We are willing to continue to work tirelessly on this task of conveying public opinion until the establishment of a formal public opinion organ. We firmly believe that all officials and citizens who care about the construction of Shanghai will agree with this!</p>

<h3>On the New Guinea Island Front: Japanese Army's Achievements in Three Months; Enemy Suffered 5,000 Casualties and Lost Over 300 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 31st: Our troops in the vicinity of Salamaua, New Guinea Island, along the line of Kamidam-Mubo-Noso Bay, have been engaging in counterattacks against enemy forces advancing from Noso and near Wau since June 3rd, under the support of superior air power, inflicting heavy casualties. They are currently engaged in fierce battles near Salamaua. During this period, enemy losses are estimated at over 5,600 casualties. In the New Guinea region, our air force and ground forces cooperated to attack enemy air bases such as PeNo PeNo and Hopubu, and engaged attacking enemy aircraft. Fierce fighting continues, during which a total of 358 enemy aircraft were shot down, with 53 unconfirmed. Our losses were 103 aircraft.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – The fighting in the Salamaua region of New Guinea appears to be intensifying daily, with the Japanese army inflicting significant damage on the Allied forces. According to a dispatch from San Francisco, a frontline correspondent for the Associated Press reported on the 30th regarding the situation in that area: the Allied forces in Salamaua were forced to retreat from several locations in the past two to three days due to the fierce counterattacks by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Land in Sandu Ao, Safeguarding Maritime Security and Holding Profound Historical Significance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese naval landing forces successfully landed in Sandu Ao, Fujian Province, on the 28th and are actively clearing out the remaining enemy forces. Sandu Ao is the finest natural harbor within the eastern sea fortress of Fujian Province on the Chinese coastline, located on the southern shore of Sandu Island in Sandu Bay. The island is over 20 li in circumference, with rolling hills and lush bamboo forests, offering scenic views. The waters within the harbor are deep and calm, allowing giant warships to moor safely. Previously, there was a small village. In the 24th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1898), Italy requested to lease the area, which was then developed into a commercial port. In the 25th year, it became a dedicated port for exporting tea. However, due to the surrounding mountains, trade was difficult to develop. Nevertheless, because the area faces the Taiwan Strait, it has become a military stronghold. Americans planned to establish a naval coaling station there in the 26th year of the Guangxu Emperor, but it was halted due to Japanese opposition. Now, the American attempt to use it as a submarine base has been quickly thwarted by the Japanese army. This is of great significance for ensuring maritime security in the Greater East Asia region. At the same time, the Japanese army can seize the opportunity to land in Ningde County, Fujian, as a precursor to the attack on Fuzhou. This is of even greater historical significance for achieving overall peace in China and defeating the United Kingdom and the United States, thereby completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the development of the war situation is highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Zhang Heng Arrives in Hankou to Inspect National Army</h3>
<p>Hankou, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Zhang Heng, Lieutenant General of the Army and Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters for Army Training, along with Wu Qihong, Director of the Headquarters, and others, are inspecting the quality and training of the National Army in Wuhan to facilitate improvements. Zhang and his party of seven arrived in Hankou a few days ago. A reporter interviewed Zhang at his hotel yesterday, and he made the following remarks: "The military authorities of the National Government, in order to encourage military construction to complete the Qingxiang (clearing the villages) work, establish local order, and then assist in the Greater East Asia War, are striving for excellence and strengthening the quality and training of the National Army. This time, I was ordered to come to Wuhan to inspect the quality and training of the National Army to provide a basis for improvement. After the inspection is completed, the inspection situation will be announced."</p>
<h3>Rong Ziheng Pays Respects to Chairman</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – General Rong Ziheng, commander of the Provisional 10th Army Group, paid respects to the Chairman at 3:00 PM on the 31st. The Chairman inquired in detail about the military and political situation, and gave instructions on all relevant matters. General Rong respectfully took his leave at 3:30 PM, feeling inspired.</p>

<h3>Director of the Hagihagi Reporting Department Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Major General Hagihagi, Director of the Army Reporting Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, made the following remarks on the 31st:</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime, based on the Lend-Lease Act, has borrowed a huge amount of money from the United Kingdom. Even if it uses the land resources under Chongqing's control, or even enslaves its people to the United States, it will be difficult to repay the loans. Furthermore, the regime purchased a large amount of materials, resulting in a huge debt. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in the 25th year of the Showa era (1940), the amount of money Chongqing borrowed from the United States, excluding those related to the Lend-Lease Act, was already $31,943,000. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War (i.e., the 17th year of Showa), it has reached $1,047,743,000 (equivalent to 20,954,860,000 old legal tender). Among them, about 500 million was the US dollar public debt issued for the direct purpose of helping Chongqing's finances. Furthermore, according to the Times, the materials transported to Chongqing based on the Lend-Lease Act, from the 16th year of Showa to February of the 18th year, have reached more than 1 billion US dollars. However, the exact amount that actually arrived in Chongqing is unknown. The repayment method stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act is also problematic. According to the treaty, after the war, the President of the United States will determine what is useful for the defense of the United States or the Western Hemisphere, and use it as the consideration for repayment. This means that all materials, even land, railways, and other rights and interests, can be decided by the United States as compensation. Currently, Chongqing has suffered tremendous sacrifices for the United Kingdom and the United States, especially in terms of personnel losses, but the United States has no sympathy for this. According to a resolution of the Chongqing Senate in mid-August, after the United Kingdom and the United States abandon extraterritoriality in China, foreign investment in China tends to be hesitant. However, because China needs to actively develop in the future and now, it welcomes foreign investment. Therefore, the government has decided to provide absolute guarantees and has announced relevant measures. The so-called absolute guarantee is nothing more than wanting to give the right to control China to foreign capitalists. In other words, Chongqing is sacrificing the interests of the Chinese people to save itself in the short term, and is selling hundreds of millions of Chinese people to British and American capitalists. Even if Chongqing can end the war with favorable treaties, it will have to dedicate the land of the entire country to the United Kingdom and the United States to repay the debts incurred during the war. If Japan no longer exists in East Asia, the United Kingdom and the United States will use this debt as a basis to raise unreasonable demands. At that time, even if Chongqing attempts to compensate for the great sacrifices it suffered during the war, it will be absolutely impossible.</p>

<h3>The Quebec Conference and the Unresolved Issues Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>In addition to addressing the new situation in Europe after the Italian coup, the Anglo-American conference in Quebec had many other issues. It seems that the issue of coordinating between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union remained the central topic of discussion. To what extent can the opinions of the countries concerned be reconciled? To what extent can the disputes between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union since the Casablanca Conference be resolved? Needless to say, these were the main topics of the conference. Below is an introduction to the background and nature of the Anglo-American-Soviet disputes, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>The Second Front Issue</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, the New York Times stated: "The Soviet Union demands the implementation of direct and large-scale operations on the northern coast of France." The Soviet Pravda reprinted an article from the magazine "War and the Working Class" on August 5th, stating that the Soviet Union clearly informed the United Kingdom and the United States of the significance of the Second Front. The article said:</p>
<p>"At the Casablanca Conference in January of this year, a plan for the military actions of the Anglo-American Allied forces for the nine months of this year was decided. Although it also included the Second Front, the nine months are coming to an end, and the Second Front has not yet been formed. Looking at the achievements made to date, the Anglo-American forces have not yet truly clashed with the German army. The Anglo-Americans defend the delay of the Second Front with the reasons of the European Fortress, the unresolved shipping problem, and the risky nature of the invasion. But the European Fortress is a product of imagination, and the shipping problem has been solved due to the increase in American shipbuilding and the experience of the Anglo-American landing in North Africa and the Battle of Sicily. And the risk of invasion could be said in the first year of the war, but it is no longer applicable this year."</p>
<p>In response, the New York Times argued: "If the Anglo-Americans did not have the determination to carry out the above-mentioned operations, then what need was there for discussion?" The Second Front issue had already created a considerable gap between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union before this Anglo-American conference.</p>
<p>Poland and the Three Balkan Countries</p>
<p>During the Soviet-Polish border dispute this spring, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union openly expressed their differing views on small countries, using the Atlantic Charter as a basis. At the time, Churchill said: "After the war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union should coordinate with each other to establish a European conference composed of many countries, a national union that is consistent with the lofty and permanent interests of the three countries. However, it is foolish to discuss borderlines in the current state of the war." Thus, this issue was left unresolved. In this conference, if the aim is to adjust Anglo-American-Soviet politics, the first realistic topic will be this. The New York Times stated:</p>
<p>"The United Kingdom and the United States often look at the Soviet Union with suspicion, and the Soviet Union sees the United Kingdom and the United States using these countries to encircle the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>This proves that the Polish border issue remains profoundly divisive. The authoritative British magazine "Nineteenth Century and After" boldly attacked the Soviet Union on this issue in its June issue, incurring the anger of the Soviet Union. The magazine's argument was:</p>
<p>"The loss of its eastern part is a matter of life and death for Poland. That is to say, Poland has lost half of its territory and one-third of its people. But on the Soviet side, the gains from the merger are minimal. The Soviet-Polish dispute is not an isolated phenomenon. The Soviet Union is using the same methods in its policy towards the southern countries. The Soviet Union regards General Mihailovic of the southern countries as the equivalent of Sikorski. After the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland, it bordered Carpathia-Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia. The residents there have similar relations to the Galician residents, so the Soviet Union's claim of annexation is well-founded, and it should be said that it reveals the true intentions of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Polish issue contains significant interests for the United Kingdom, so British public opinion openly focuses its suspicion on the Soviet Union, even more so than what the New York Times pointed out.</p>
<p>The Result of the Conference</p>
<p>In summary, the truth about the disagreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is that they are completely united and have no differences on the military objective of defeating Germany. However, with regard to the political objectives of the three countries, profound conflicts are exposed. Therefore, this Anglo-American conference, with the above-mentioned issues as the center, in terms of political adjustment, if it is to achieve any development, it should at least be to satisfy Stalin's reciprocity diplomacy with the realization of the Second Front and concessions on Eastern European issues. Without the participation of the Soviet Union in the Anglo-American conference, in terms of resolving problems, the outcome of the conference will not be clearly expressed. The future negotiations between the three countries related to the progress of the war situation are extremely noteworthy. (Xiang: Translated from the August 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Stalin Agrees to Hold Three-Country Conference; Maisky Arrives in the UK</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from London, Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, arrived in London on the night of the 29th. Also, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maisky, has arrived in London and has reportedly held multiple meetings with British Foreign Secretary Eden. The New York Evening Post reported on the 28th in a dispatch from London that Soviet Chairman Stalin has agreed to hold a three-country conference between the Soviet government and the United Kingdom and the United States. It is said that People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov has informed the ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Soviet Union of the above decision. Since the news spread, the Allied propaganda machine has been doing its best to promote the three-country conference. Coupled with the arrival of Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, in London, it is widely speculated that preparations for the Anglo-American-Soviet conference may have already begun.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – New York Daily Mirror writer Pearson said in a radio address yesterday that Soviet leader Stalin has agreed to meet with Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, and predicted that before his resignation last week, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles was sent to the Soviet Union to prepare the groundwork for the conference. Pearson also said that Roosevelt will not participate in the 1944 presidential election.</p>

<p>North China Journalist Delegation Left Shanghai for Hangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>Visited the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank Before Departure</p>
<p>Talked with Consultant Kimura About Shanghai's Economy</p>
<p>Shanghai Central News Agency: On the third day of the North China Journalist Delegation's visit to Shanghai, they continued to visit the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and the Shenxin Textile Factory, accompanied by personnel from the Municipal Propaganda Department. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting the Central Reserve Bank Branch</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the entire delegation went to visit the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. Zhang Jusheng, Deputy Manager of the branch, Wang Liqing, Assistant Manager, and Pan Tongyun, Section Chief of the Investigation Department, greeted them and guided them to visit the various departments of the bank. They introduced them to the bank's economic advisor, Mr. Kimura. During the tea party, Advisor Kimura expressed his thoughts on the financial situation centered on Shanghai and talked freely for more than an hour before they departed. At 10:30 AM, the journalist delegation went to visit the No. 9 Factory of Shenxin Textile Factory on Macau Road, Tokyo Road. Wu Shihui, Chief Engineer of the factory, _ Li Wu Zhongyi, and Guo Zuyi greeted them and invited them to sit down. Wu Shihui delivered a speech, expressing his welcome and informing them of the factory's brief history and everything inside. They were then guided to visit the factory, dormitory, hospital, Shen Jiu Cooperative, and Shuangma _ Club for more than an hour before the visit ended. It is also learned that the journalist delegation went to Hangzhou at 3:00 PM yesterday and will return to Shanghai at 9:00 PM today. It was originally scheduled to return to the north on the morning of the 2nd. However, in order to facilitate the members' free browsing, they were persuaded to stay one more day to show the hospitality of the hosts. It is reported that Zhou, the President of the Central Reserve Bank, has scheduled a banquet for the delegation at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. It is also heard that the Shenxin authorities are very happy about the delegation's visit to the south and will also _ the delegation to stay in Shanghai and will hold a tea party at the Xindu Restaurant at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. In addition, during the delegation's visit to Hangzhou, the Propaganda Department has set up a temporary _ contact office at No. 223, Xinyuan Hotel, and has sent personnel from the department to reside in the office to facilitate contact from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Advisor Kimura's Speech</p>
<p>Advisor Kimura of the Central Reserve Bank gave the following speech at the tea party to welcome the North China Journalist Delegation: Gentlemen, since its establishment the year before last, our bank has issued reserve notes, which are the only currency in Central and Southern China. Since its issuance, it has been very well circulated, and the number _ has also been increasing day by day. Recently, the _ has risen sharply, increasing day by day. The outside world believes that this is due to the increase in the amount of currency _ issued. But the reality is not so. Judging from the current ratio of prices, the amount of currency issued is still insufficient. To give an example, the silver market has been extremely tight recently, and general commercial banks have felt the lack of funds, and the interest rate has even reached two points. This is because the market has a need for currency issuance. Shanghai is a large commercial port. Before the war, all kinds of materials could be imported from abroad. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the import of foreign materials was suddenly cut off, and the lack of materials in Shanghai became more and more serious. At this time, the general public absorbed and hoarded a large amount of materials, which is one of the major reasons for the current shortage of materials in the market. In fact, although the source of materials in Shanghai has been cut off, there is still a large inventory of materials. Among the commodities in the country, cotton cloth and cotton yarn are the largest. Therefore, the authorities should purchase them in order to lower prices and stabilize people's livelihood. In the future, how to allocate the purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth evenly, and the problem of lowering prices and other related difficulties exist. If these difficulties can be resolved, it will not be difficult to stabilize people's livelihood. Currently, all countries in the world are experiencing economic difficulties and are implementing controlled economies. China is no exception. As you all know, controlled economy is not successful without two supports: _ There must be a strong political force as its background, _ The general public needs to fully understand the controlled economy. Although China has political power, the general public has a weak concept. So it is very difficult in China. However, from my personal observation, China's civil autonomous organizations are very strong. It is very easy to implement controlled economy by using civil autonomous power. Looking around at the autonomous power of a country, there are very few countries as strong as China. Now that China has such strong autonomous power, then the general guiding class and government leaders _ can use this power to implement controlled economy. The so-called guiding class does not only refer to general government officials. You are the guiding class of public opinion in North China. I hope you can assist politics and implement controlled politics.</p>
<p>The Press Circles Gave a Banquet Yesterday</p>

<p>August 31, 1943</p>
<p>Acting Director Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Economic Circles</p>
<p>Comment on the Unification of Control</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control _ Association is fully responsible for all matters related to the controlled purchase and distribution of yarn and cloth, and is also fully responsible for all matters related to the controlled purchase and distribution of grain. The former is related to the people's clothing, and the latter is related to the people's food. Therefore, whether managing yarn and cloth or managing grain, the greatest mission and responsibility is to wholeheartedly meet the needs of the people's livelihood in wartime. Therefore, we cannot help but say more about purchase and distribution.</p>
<p>Purchase and distribution are the two main tools for promoting a controlled economy. They must be complementary and work together to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihood. Otherwise, it is impossible. Originally, to take must be to give. What is taken from the people must be used for the people. Only then can the people be sincerely convinced. Otherwise, it is impossible.</p>
<p>The most important thing for people's livelihood is clothing and food. Now, the full power of purchase and distribution of clothing and food is concentrated in one institution. It can be said that the control is unified. What we hope for after the unification of control is that we must do our best to ensure that these two things that people cannot live without - clothing and food - are not in short supply. And the way to ensure this is to distribute them universally. Of course, if we talk about distribution without first talking about purchase, then even if we talk about distribution, we will suffer from not being able to say something substantial. However, if we talk about purchase without considering distribution at the same time, then even if we talk about purchase, we are afraid that we cannot say something reasonable. Therefore, purchase and distribution must be complementary.</p>
<p>All Industries Sell Goods</p>
<p>Limited to Sales to Legitimate Users</p>
<p>Industry Associations Issue Notices for Compliance</p>
<p>The city's industry associations have successively completed their reorganization. However, in order to assist the authorities in stabilizing the commercial market and ensuring that various daily necessities are available in the market for a long time, and to prevent shortages, meetings have been convened separately to discuss effective methods. It has been decided that all members of the industry associations must only sell any goods sold in retail outlets on a daily basis to legitimate users and must not sell them to retailers at high prices. When purchasing goods, they should be asked to present their citizen certificate. The industry associations have now notified all members to comply.</p>
<p>Transactions Must Be Documented</p>
<p>According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, all companies, firms, or manufacturers must limit the sale or addition of any goods of any nature to companies or firms in their respective industries. At the same time, after the goods are delivered, both the buyer and seller must issue a sales receipt. In addition to each party holding a copy, another copy must be sent to the Municipal Market Management Committee or the respective industry association for record and future verification. Failure to comply with this procedure will be considered an illegal transaction, and any disputes that arise in the future will not be mediated.</p>
<p>Brokers Prohibited from Entering the Market</p>
<p>As for various goods previously transacted through brokers who took commissions from them, these people often deliberately fabricate rights and wrongs when people are uneasy, in order to gain outside profits, which is very harmful to commodity prices. It is now learned that the persons in charge of each industry association believe that the brokerage system must be temporarily prohibited. Notices have been posted separately to prohibit brokers from entering the market without permission. If any traces of those who are active in the market are found, they will be expelled from the market. If any member entrusts them to sell spot goods, they will also be subject to appropriate fines.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Association to Purchase New Cotton</p>
<p>The new cotton from various producing areas in the Central China region is about to enter the market, and the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Cotton Industry Association are currently preparing a comprehensive purchase plan. As for the cotton merchants' purchase funds, they may follow the precedent of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and have the Central Reserve Bank release them by rediscounting bills. It is learned that if the cotton production plan for the current year can be fully implemented, the number is expected to be</p>
<p>Four Million Bales</p>
<p>The cotton field of 7200 acres is directly under the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association, and 18,500 acres are lent to designated farmers, while another 100,000 acres are open to general farmers based on special regulations. In addition, the _ cultivated cotton fields _ in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei</p>
<p>A total of 15,356,000 acres are hooked to maintain and distribute excellent seeds and improve technical irrigation work, in order to ensure that the amount of cotton production can reach 4 million bales this year. According to the _ fields cultivated in the six provinces, Jiangsu Province has 7,654,000 acres, Jiangxi Province has 222,000 acres, Zhejiang Province has 943,000 acres, Hunan Province has 542,000 acres, Hubei Province has 5,538,000 acres, and Anhui Province has 456,000 acres, which is about three times more than the production volume of last year.</p>
<p>Corn and Sorghum Can Be Purchased for 600,000 Bales</p>
<p>The estimated purchaseable amount of corn in various regions of Central China this year is estimated as follows: Chongming District, 50,000 to 10,000 bales, Qingpu District, 45,000 bales, Nanjing Zhenjiang District, 10,000 bales, Wuhu District, 150,000 bales, Anqing District, 100,000 bales. Tonghai District, 30,000 bales. The amount of sorghum is estimated as follows: Northern Anhui District, 50,000 bales, Yangzhou Taizhou, 50,000 bales. A total of 490,000 to 450,000 bales of corn and 100,000 bales of sorghum.</p>
<p>Reduced Household Rice</p>
<p>Hope the Grain Department Improves</p>
<p>Since the quantity of rice distributed in this cloth allocation has been reduced since July 1, it has had a serious impact on the people's minds and commodity prices, forming a major economic problem. The Chinese and Japanese parties sincerely hope that it can be resolved quickly. However, from the 29th of August to the 5th of September, the amount of household rice in the 45th issue was changed again from one liter per issue to half a liter. In order to solve the problem of people's livelihood and commodity prices, it is necessary to implement emergency countermeasures. Today's reduction is the most recent since the implementation of the distribution. At this time of year when the old and new crops are not connected, all parties are concerned and hope that the Grain Department will handle it well. All sectors of the Chinese side believe that the only way to establish a private organization is to engage in solving the food rice question. (Congressman Yunpeng, Mainland New Daily, August 31)</p>
<p>Exchange Rates of the Bank of China in Various Places</p>
<p>"Note" A handling fee of at least 3 corners will be charged for each exchange rate. A handling fee of 1 yuan will be added for each mail transfer and a handling fee of 3 yuan will be added for each telegraphic transfer, and an additional telegram fee of 30 yuan, which will be implemented from September 1st.</p>
<p>Activities of Various Industry Associations</p>
<p>Insurance Industry</p>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Municipality Insurance Brokers Association has begun to handle registration matters. All insurance brokers in Shanghai who have obtained a certificate from the Insurance Supervision Bureau or have applied to the Supervision Bureau and have sufficient proof should bring the proof documents to Room 417, 4th Floor, No. 160, Edward Road to handle registration procedures. The deadline is said to be the 4th of this month.</p>

<p>Reserve Fund Discount for Silver Shops</p>
<p>China Reserve Bank Revises Measures</p>
<p>The China Reserve Bank's deposits for silver shops as collateralized discount loans were originally intended to regulate the temporary positions of various banks and shops, and required the Silver Industry Association to issue a letter of certification to show caution. However, it has been found that recently, the bank shops have made this _ present and often applied for extensions repeatedly, and the winter connection has lost the meaning of the China Reserve's temporary relief. It has recently been stipulated by the China Reserve Bank that those who make this discount for the second time should apply seven days after the first discount expires, and the third time should apply half a month after the second discount expires, and the fourth time should be at least one month after the third discount expires, in order to show restrictions. In addition, it has been found that the deposit reserve guarantee discount should be limited to those who pay cash in full. In the future, when the Silver Industry Association issues this certificate of certification, it must comply with the above regulations.</p>

<p>Reaching Public Opinion</p>
<p>Citizens of Shanghai Provide Opinions on Construction</p>
<p>Opinions on Improving the New Shanghai Municipal Administration by Yao Shaosheng</p>
<p>Special Collection 1</p>
<p>Since _ the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai, the government should show a spirit of "starting anew with the people" everywhere. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the China Daily soliciting citizens' _ Shanghai municipal _ implementation opinions, I am writing down the _ points that I feel, hoping for guidance from the authorities and citizens.</p>
<p>Food Supply</p>
<p>"Food is the most important thing for the people." This is already a "divinely ordained" saying. In the past, the distribution and procurement of household rice were the responsibility of the Allied Forces Command. The handling was quite satisfactory. However, once it was transferred to our official hands, the procurement seemed to be quite slow. Therefore, the distribution of household rice in each issue also seemed to be slow. Also, due to the limited quantity purchased, the distribution quantity of household rice is also being reduced. At first, there was only one liter, and this issue there is only half a liter. In the past, two liters were not enough, so how could one liter be enough? Another point is that the price of household rice is also constantly being increased. Rice is the most important of all major commodities. Since the official price of rice has been increased, it will certainly result in rampant black market rice prices. Not only rice, but the impact has also led to price increases in other commodities. The government's move may be considered unavoidable by the government itself. How can they know that this move will produce many stable evils? This is definitely not what a wise authority should do. If the government authorities are determined to "suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood," then please increase the quantity of household rice allocated as soon as possible. According to my observation, assuming that one liter of rice per person is sufficient for two days, it is best to allocate five liters every ten days. At the same time, reduce the selling price. If it can be effectively implemented, then prices will be suppressed naturally, and people's livelihood will be truly stable.</p>
<p>Donation Issues</p>
<p>In the past, during the Concession era, citizens had to pay many donations every month or at any time. Almost everything required donations, and the amount of donations was constantly increasing. This was really a harsh government that squeezed the fat of the Chinese people. Now that the concessions have been recovered, we should relieve our Chinese compatriots of this heavy shackle. I believe that the government authorities should quickly readjust the various taxes levied during the Concession era by foreigners. Which should be paid, which should be abolished, and which should have the amount of donations reduced. I believe that the "loss tax" should be distinguished, and not _ everything should be taxed. All daily necessities, such as cooking oil, sugar, _ soy sauce, soap, matches... etc., should all be canceled. On the other hand, things that are not necessities, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and cosmetics, should still be taxed. Entertainment such as movies, Peking Opera, and dancing can increase the amount of donations, on the one hand, it can also restrict unnecessary consumption by the people.</p>
<p>Police Affairs</p>
<p>I think the purpose of using police in local areas is to maintain law and order so that people can live and work in peace and contentment. For the attendance of police officers, their degree of maintaining law and order should be used as the standard. After the recovery of the concessions, this situation should be considered under the reform of police affairs.</p>
<p>Public Health</p>
<p>In the past, during the administrative era of foreign rule in the concessions, although there were many malpractices, there was one point that could not be buried. That is, they handled public health in the area quite seriously. Vaccinations, injections, and food inspections need not be said, but they also paid attention to the cleanliness of the roads. But</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Returns to Washington; Hull Denies Anti-Soviet Stance</h3>
<p>Lisbon, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Washington news, President Roosevelt returned to Washington yesterday morning and immediately convened military leaders and others regularly with White House Secretary O'Leary. A "post-Quebec Conference meeting" was held. Regarding the purpose of British Prime Minister Churchill's upcoming visit to Washington, there has been no official announcement, but it is believed that his discussions with President Roosevelt and others will focus on wartime and post-war political issues, and may also determine the details of the policies established at the Quebec Conference. A British spokesman in Quebec announced yesterday that Churchill's broadcast today will not contain any special announcements. At the same time, Canadian Prime Minister King traveled from Ottawa to Quebec yesterday afternoon to confer with Churchill.</p>
<p>Lisbon, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Washington news, U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday denied at a reception for the press allegations by New York commentator Bellson that he and other senior State Department officials were anti-Soviet and hoped for a large-scale Soviet bloodshed. He said, "I usually do not pay attention to attacks on the State Department or on me personally, but if this attack concerns our relationship with our allies, then I must pay attention to it."</p>
<h3>British Troops Unsuccessfully Land on the Southern Coast of Italy; Quickly Repelled by Garrison</h3>
<p>Berlin, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: It was announced here today that the British army's attempt to land on a small scale southeast of Reggio on the southern coast of Italy a few days ago was quickly repelled by the garrison. Only 400 British troops were involved, who sailed to the southeast of Reggio and landed there. The garrison immediately discovered the enemy's actions and began to attack, and the enemy's movements were completely thwarted.</p>

<h3>Residents Eagerly Await Household Sugar and Oil</h3>
<p>Residents have been looking forward to the implementation and distribution of the fifth phase of household oil and the sixth phase of household sugar for a long time. However, although the sugar industry has already completed the delivery, and the oil is also being prepared for delivery, the date of sale has not yet been clearly determined. It is understood that sugar and oil are essential daily foods. The authorities' order to implement a per capita distribution method is purely to alleviate the people's difficulties, and should not be delayed, let alone change prices.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office Assessment Committee</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Groups: Cotton Yarn, Grey Cloth, and Processed Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control General Association's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Organizational Outline, has appointed textile technology experts and experienced yarn and cloth merchants as members to form the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Quality and Price Assessment Committee, which held its first inaugural meeting yesterday (31st) at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Assessment Committee Members</p>
<p>The following assessment committee members attended: Bu Boxun, Ying Yuanzai, Xu Xiuxiao, Gong Dingluo, Ping Linbo, Zheng Weizhang, Mi Wenjun, Zhou Rongsun, Wu Shihhuai, Fang Weiping, Chen Shouyi, Zou Lin, Yang Yuelin, Guo Zhongkang, Wu Xinqi, Wu Mingyong, Tao Shanzhong, Ling Jianxin, and 18 others. Absent was committee member Qin Defang. The meeting was led by the head of the office, Nie Lusheng, and the deputy head, Cao Boquan. First, the chairman of the committee, Nie Lusheng, head of the office, reported on the preparation process, and then the proposed resolutions were discussed. Regarding the review and approval of the price standards for purchasing yarn and cloth and the increase or decrease in purchasing prices, it was resolved to divide into three groups: cotton yarn group, grey cotton cloth group, and processed cotton cloth group, which will hold separate group meetings to assess quality and price.</p>
<p>Minister Okazaki Stated That Evasion of Purchases is Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Minister Okazaki, Director-General of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, made important remarks on the issue of cotton yarn and cloth purchases by the Chinese and Japanese authorities at a reception for Chinese reporters yesterday. Minister Okazaki first stated that the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, under the joint promotion of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, has achieved good results. However, some merchants disregard the law and secretly transport goods to various places through transportation companies in order to avoid the purchasing authorities. Once this illegal situation is discovered, not only will they be severely punished, but the authorities can expand the scope of purchases to areas where yarn and cloth can escape. Therefore, even if merchants can transport yarn and cloth out of Shanghai, they will still be purchased by the authorities in other places. In addition, some cotton cloth shops have been cutting and selling cloth in pieces in recent days, and the authorities will strictly investigate this. As for the distribution of yarn and cloth in the future, the authorities have decided to distribute as much as possible to various parts of Central China. Therefore, some people are concerned about whether this yarn and cloth will flow into the interior. Minister Okazaki said that this is not so important, because the purpose of the Chinese and Japanese authorities' purchase of yarn and cloth is to promote the exchange of materials and stabilize currency, in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, even if some of it flows into the interior, it can also benefit the people there and stabilize their lives, so there is no need for special concern.</p>
<p>Commissioner Honda Talks About Purchase Not Being Postponed</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Commercial Control Association Commissioner Honda Daisaku gave a speech: Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as a national policy, it is decided that the deadline is September 6th, and it will not be postponed. Those who wait and see and mislead themselves within the deadline will not only have their goods confiscated, but will also be punished for violating national laws. From September 1st to 6th, deliveries to Lao Bi will be very enthusiastic, so it is decided to have normal office hours on Sunday the 5th. Regarding the speculative retailers in the market recently who are calling for large price reductions, this is a complete violation of national policy. The Commercial Control Association recently summoned such illegal shop owners and warned them not to take advantage of loopholes. If the amount of cotton yarn and cloth sold in August exceeds the average amount from January to August of the 32nd year, they will be severely punished. Allied cotton yarn and cloth businesses are handing over all cotton yarn and cloth to the office. I hope that our country's merchants will handle it as soon as possible and do not mislead themselves. Citizens should not blindly purchase unnecessary amounts of cotton cloth, because after the government purchases and distributes it, the price will definitely be lower than the selling price of other retailers.</p>
<h3>Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools Officially Start Classes Today</h3>
<p>Western Schools Start on the 6th</p>
<p>The Education Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special Municipality has merged the school addresses of all Western schools and scheduled them to start school on the 6th of this month. In addition, municipal Chinese primary and secondary schools will officially start classes at the same time today (1st).</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate General Restricts Liquor Sales Hours</p>
<p>It is learned that the Japanese Consul General's authorities, in view of the increasingly fierce Greater East Asia War, in order to enable Japanese residents to thoroughly implement a life of decisive battle, have decided to decisively implement restrictions on liquor sales hours on the occasion of the return of the Concessions. From September 1st, all food and beverage stores operated by Japanese people must only be allowed to sell alcohol from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. every day; otherwise, they must not supply guests with alcohol.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Immediately Available for General Sale</h3>
<p>Due to the insufficient per capita rice ration for this period in the first and eighth districts, the authorities will issue several types of coarse grains, including naked barley (i.e., hullless barley), sorghum, and red millet, to supplement it. These coarse grains have been milled by Shunfeng, Hengkang, Hengyi, and other rice mills, and are scheduled to be sold generally from today (1st) to the 5th. Citizens can use Purchase Coarse Grains Second Coupon No. 2 to purchase half a catty of barley or naked barley, sorghum or red millet at the designated retail rice shops or district public offices' rice distribution stations for a price of two yuan.</p>
