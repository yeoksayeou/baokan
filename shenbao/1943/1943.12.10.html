<p>代論</p>
<h3>從日本歸來</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭二周紀念委員會及上海新聞聯合會，聯合主辦之講演會，昨為第一日，假座大華戲院舉行，承約彬龢主講，因時間匆促，未及詳述，茲略記如次：</p>
<p>我這次從日本回來以後，對於日本戰時實况的介紹，巳經有幾次了。今天還想從生產航空各方面講述大概。</p>
<p>日本國內有一句口號，叫做「戰生如一」，意思是說作戰與生產是一件事，並不是兩件事。因為作戰的需要，固然提高生產效率，同時，節省一切非直接與作戰有關係的物資，貢默於作戰需要，就是平時的物資，到了目前，必須發生兩倍甚至三倍五倍的效用，更為重要。為了作戰，刺激了生產的效率與物資的效用。所以，謂之「戰生如一」。憑藉了這一力量，不論在海陸空上都有着絕對擊敗英美的信念。</p>
<p>試舉實例說吧！日本對於生產部門調整人力，使男女老幼都使用其所可貢獻的力量，整個的策劃。預定自明年一月中旬開始，政府規定十七種輕易職業，如事務輔助之文書收發，現金出納，商店店員，收帳員，侍役等等，不准男子担任，而完全代以女子。送一種職業界的大變動，驟視之似為多事，可是，細加考察，移出大量男子使之担任比較重要之生產工作，則其貢獻必更大。而女子也可出其勞力服務，稱得上總動員人力。</p>
<p>再有一個工廠，叫做尾崎精工廠，當局要想利用殘廢的人做工作，就雇用了十幾個啞吧，使之硏磨鑽石，試用結果，開始三個月，在敎導學習期間，工作比較常人差劣，就是施敎方面也比較困難。然而，經過四個月以後，逐漸超過普通人而上，例如製品成績，健全工人只有百分之八十五。啞吧却有百分之九十五。得到了這樣好的成績，該廠便又雇用了幾十個啞吧，現有啞工人八十餘人。</p>
<p>上面是說人力的調整與殘廢的利用。可是，不僅如此，每一個人，還儘可能練成多方面的能力，就是一個人能够發生幾個人的效用。</p>
<p>且看日本擊落下的美國飛機，毫不輕忽地仔細硏究，從構造到設備，澈底明白。他們發現美機的描準機與無綫電機，都不及日本的精巧，然而「雷波兵器」，美機却是普遍應用而又精美。於是，日本技術家們發奮努力，陸海軍共同組織「電波硏究所」，以求改善，同時，數量方面，工廠也努力生產，原來一年完成的，現在半月即可。甚至學校學生組織「電波學生報國隊」，幫助工廠與工人一起工作。</p>
<p>日本飛機駕駛員訓練，實際上從中學時代便開始，而且是私塾式的，從起飛降陸到各種戰鬥，由一二個敎官敎導，六種投能完備的。而美國飛行員是一人一技主美，會使用前座機關槍的，即不會使用後　　關槍。其次，日本一架飛械從早晨至正午再至黃昏，飛繞不絕，可抵三四架使用。這樣，一千倘飛行員，一千架飛機，至少等於美國的三千個飛行員，三千架飛機的效用，這並不是隨便的空話，上而已經有了相當的事例了。</p>
<p>節衣縮食四字，在日本也切實地實踐了。吃三碗的改吃兩碗，乃是常事，富貴之家，也是蔬菜淡飯。穿新衣是浚事，御舊服方為光榮。</p>
<p>此外，戰鬥精神，充溢全民，雄壯的可歌泣的事蹟，令人感動。出征的靑年學生，眞是個個懷抱必死之決心，願與敵人周旋於疆塲。他們分說：「後繼的人，踏着找們的血跡，跨過我們的屍首，奮勇邁進，打倒敵人，擊滅敵人。」直是氣吞山河！而留在學校的學生則說：「我們現在要做最好的學生，將來要做最强的兵士」。</p>
<p>最後，我們平心靜氣的想一想。國家要求進步，人民要求進步，則日本的一切好榜樣，都值得我們學習。</p>
<h3>日機襲新幾內亞擊沉魚雷艇三艘　天比飛機塲被炸損害甚大</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某某地電，日海軍機隊曾於五日夜往　芬希哈罕附近敵軍，炸燬陸上陣地兩處，並於附近海上擊沉敵魚雷艇一艘。又是日夜日海軍水上機隊曾於坦比爾海峽攻擊敵魚雷艇羣，擊沉其二艘，日方無損害。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　據太平洋日軍某基地電，陸軍機隊曾於六日下午三時半，七時半及八時十分三次往襲新幾內亞島天比飛機塲，將機塲南側附屬設施，兵營及軍需品堆積所炸毀，有四處被炸起火，火藥庫中彈，更發生五次爆炸，致該機塲完全為黑烟籠罩，損害甚大。又七日下午三時餘，日軍機隊曾往轟炸威瓦克西南約二百三十公里之喀某亞布，該地有八處被炸起火。南太平洋日軍某基地電，日軍“十月二十日至十一月二十日之一個月間，在新幾內亞馬當南方約五公里拉姆河左側歡喜嶺附近地區作戰，　獲綜合戰果如次：　敵軍棄屍三百七十二具，敵軍損害總數千餘名。　鹵獲步槍六十九，輕機槍十一，自動步槍八，各稱子彈約一萬三千，　破逐營幕三，　日方陣亡十四名。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據新金山電稱：西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部八日發表，新幾內亞芬希哈罕戰區戰况稱澳軍現正於瓦底奧地區典日軍酣戰中。日軍於七日繼續反攻澳軍陳地，攻佔有利陣地。</p>
<h3>德外交部長　訪日大使館　兩國團結將益形堅強</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德外長里賓特洛甫，曾於大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，赴日駐德大使館訪問，對日僑談稱：德國國民對日軍於此二年間所獲之輝煌戰果，實衷心祝賀，於獲得最後勝利前，誓與日本國民堅固携手邁進。日駐德大島大使對此亦表明堅强之決意。又日德，德義兩協會，並定於十一日共同主辦慶祝大東亞戰爭二週年紀念典禮，日德兩國今後之團結，將益形堅强。</p>
<p>日大使招待德記者</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　日駐德大使大島中將，於大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，在此間大使館招待德新聞記者席上演說，表示對德日合力建設世界新秩序之信念，並稱：二年前十二月八日日本握刀在手，答覆英·美方面無數次之挑戰，而最後在珍珠灣予敵人一重大打擊，今日吾一念及英勇之盟邦將士在各前綫之可　成就，更致幕於德舉國上下在後方之盡夜勤勞，對此世運所關之掙扎，盡其本位之責任，不因無意識及野蠻之空襲恐怖，而動搖其決心。</p>
<p>日本亦能迥溯若干次之大戰與勝利，運命之神，向分布於五千基羅米突半徑內之日本軍隊微笑，使日本能着手三國盟約原則之實施。</p>
<p>現在東亞及歐洲方面戰爭，均在繼續中，敵人隨時均在企圖予吾人以還擊，但在吾人繼續作戰之不可動搖決心前，此種企圖必將粉碎無疑。吾具此堅決信念，以為日·德兩國之英勇國民，實為運命所牢繫，以合力建立世界新秩序，此信念為吾人最後勝利之最可靠保證。</p>
<p>在招待席上，大島大使與一著名德記者接談，甚為歡洽，並同意於該記者之意見，以為英人在東亞所施政　實犯時代錯誤之病，不僅現在如此，以前亦然。自日本崛起東亞而為一世界大國，此項政策之不能續施，久已為一時間問題，據此而論，則日本之勝利，可稱為一種自然律。</p>
<p>大島大使指出，東亞各民族之承認日本為其領袖，係出於彼等之自由意志，並確悉純為彼等自身利益而發，並致疑於蔣介石統治下之中國人民，是否與其他東亞人民觀感相異，謂音人須確知者，即蔣介石已不能代表中國人民之眞實意志而已，於此大島大使更進而廻溯日本設立新東亞政策之原則謂中，日同盟條約為最理想的現代條約，完全權利平等。</p>
<p>關於開羅會議之公報，大島大使力斥反軸心對日本要求之矛盾，特別關於太平洋方面之實際狀况，彼等毫未顧及，例如二年前美在珍珠灣所遭之巨大損失及過去數周在太平洋上之損失，均屬在戰爭期中無法補償者，而英美宣傳恰得其反，實為可怪。又德外長里賓特洛　亦參加此招待盛會。</p>
<p>德報贊揚日軍戰果</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　值茲大束亞戰爭二週年，德報於七日晨刋及晚刊均紛紛載論，盛贊日軍在南太平洋收獲驚人戰果及邁進建設大束亞新秩序之實力論調。德報論評內有謂，日本政府不僅在軍事上採取攻勢，即在政治與外交上，亦巳採取攻勢，使呻吟於英美兩國壓迫下各國，皆獲得民族自主國家之地位，積極從事於大東亞新秩序之建設，此足證軸心所處立塲之嚴正</p>
<h3>達拉瓦島登陸戰美火燄部隊重創</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城九日中央社電　美國某從軍記者，六日曾報稱：美軍於達拉瓦島登陸時，火燄放射部隊三分之二悉遭潰滅。據謂，美軍於達拉瓦島，開始登　時，當舟艇到達海岸之　，因受日守備軍之猛烈砲擊，陣亡極衆。既達海岸之陸戰隊，雖立即整備陣形，編成隊伍，然為將日軍自據　驅逐，除使用火燄放射器外，殆別無他策，但　　火戰放射部隊之一舟　，於距海岸僅二十英尺之地區，竟因日軍砲火之　　而顛覆，生存者僅五名，登陸之火談放射　隊，曾對日軍持火點正面加以攻擊，然每攻略一特火　，須經三晝夜之猛攻，致火談放射部隊有三分之二因攻擊該島日軍特火點而潰減。</p>

<h3>以新東洋精神建設　東亞新秩序　大川博士在京演講</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日本興亞使節大川周明博士於八日興亞演講大會席上發表演講，茲誌要旨如下：十二月八日不僅爲日本人，實爲東亞各民族，以至全世界萬國永遠可紀念之一日，蓋大東亞戰爭，即於是日開始而出現世界史上新時代，二年以來，大東亞之政治變化，實屬一大奇蹟，此即英美荷勢力之驅出東亞，自由之旗已飛揚於仰光，馬尼刺，　至未來之新德里的上空。最近大東亞會議的舉行，大東亞的宣言的發表，實可謂爲世界史之一大飛進，一大轉變。英美爲再侵東亞，仍企圖反攻，戰局雖日益激烈，但於近世之建設仍着着推進，緬菲之獨立，印度納西亞，馬來之參政，泰國領土之調整，中日同盟條約之締結，已使大東亞圈之政治機構奠定基礎，今後惟有在基礎之上努力，事雖偉大，亦甚困難，故惟有以偉大之精神，指導此偉大之歷史的事業。建設東來新秩序之大業，亦必須以偉大之精神爲基礎，中日事變之本質及意義，現已隨戰局之進展，而日益明瞭，即其中尙有建設東亞新秩序，與確立大東亞共榮圈之戰爭目的與理想</p>
<p>同生共死力行實踐</p>
<p>茲當中日兩國興亡相共之時，吾人應決心以　汪主席閣下同生共死之言，力行實踐。所謂共死，即中日兩國成爲英美奴隸，所謂同生，即以中日兩國爲中心，建設大東亞新秩序。大東亞共同宣言，雖已昭示大東亞新秩序之輪廓，但此種偉大之歷史運動，此種基礎精神，余名之爲新東洋精神。其內容第一爲應知東洋傳統之精神，尤其應準確認識中國·印度·日本之傳統精神。　此等精神，已早在公代創造其固有之物質，且使世界人類重新復活者亦甚多。第二爲理解東料民族之世界觀，即明瞭世界與人生之關係。第三爲發揚各民族精神之差別點，而發揚其特異之文化。第四爲創造新東洋精神，即應以亞洲一般的傳統爲基礎，而加以創造。第五爲將西洋之政治的國民主義與東洋的協同社會之原則。渾然融和於新東洋精神中，如此新東洋精神將成爲一世界之原理。東洋之協同社會的原則。在於全體的互愛，故爲貢獻於世界之高貴的精神財產，除此以外，則新東洋精神應具有極强之政治性，即如爲爭取解放獨立而作戰，固不待言，但尙須不斷作反西洋的與反資本主義的政治鬥爭，故新東洋精神爲由傳統與政治所決定。在今日之情勢下，新東洋精神之內容，第一應爲反西洋的，第二應爲反資本主義的，第三應爲國民主義的，第四應確立泛神論的世界觀，以上述內容組成一思想的體系，即爲新東料精神。東洋思想在今日其優秀的本質，尙有如末琢之寳玉甚多，故吾人於此武力戰爭中·道義戰爭中應更以奮勵之精神，在思想戰爭中，努力於研求探討。琢磨此未　之寳玉，創造光輝燦爛之新東洋精神。</p>
<h3>日大川博士　謁主席致敬</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　此次由日來華之興亞使節大川周明博士，於九日十一時半赴主席官邸恭謁主席致敬，當蒙主席親予賜見，旋即退出。大川氏因在京任務業已完畢，定今十日上午十時赴滬。</p>
<h3>渝對常德陷落　承認損失重大　美空軍襲俘虜收容所</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　日軍攻陷常德，實予渝方以莫大打擊，美聯社重慶八日電，曾就此報道稱，渝軍委會已發表常德失陷，並承認在軍事上經濟上均深受打擊，蓋常德失陷後，不但日軍已打通長江之路，且渝方之榖　亦地亦入於日軍掌握，湖南四川間之補給路亦被切斷，故關係非常重大。又渝軍委會八日發表戰況，並承認損失重大，謂常德戰事已於三日吿終，渝軍消耗甚大，如第五十七師僅殘餘三百人云。</p>
<p>漢口九日中央社電　駐渝美空軍，曾於七日下午一時來襲常德城內俘虜收容所，被炸死傷俘虜若干名，按此俘虜收容所所收容者乃於常德作戰及其後　淸作戰所俘之渝軍，共計數千名，此等俘虜，對於美空軍之盲炸，無不激憤云。</p>
<h3>怒江方面　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　據雲　日軍前綫某地電，十月初旬以來，日陸軍地上部隊於怒江方面所獲戰果如次：渝軍遺屍一二六六具，被俘二八四人，日軍鹵獲迫擊砲四門，擲彈筒十上個，重機槍六撥，輕機槍三十八挺，步槍三六六支，機關槍子彈一萬發，步槍子彈十四萬發，日軍損害陣亡十五人。</p>
<h3>天津舉行　獻機命名禮</h3>
<p>天津九日中央社電　天津之獻機運動，成績極佳，現已達七十架之多，其命名典禮，已於八日十一時在天津日本商業學校校地舉行，中日軍官民各界人士達二千餘名，儀式極爲隆重。</p>
<h3>日情報部長揭破　英美對東亞野心</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日情報局井口第三部長，今午會見記者團，對英美渝代表前於開羅會議事談稱，由於大東亞戰爭二年餘之經騐，已使英美兩國指導者獲得二切實敎訓，一爲日本於太平洋及東亞　有强大之戰力，一爲大東亞各國脫離英美之桎梏後，各民族不受何等强制一致團結之事實。緣此次戰爭。美國民衆於其生存上並無何等緊要關係，故美國戰爭發動者爲使國民參加戰爭，必須講求種種方策。彼等首謂日本國民爲天性好戰之國民，認日本之自衛政策爲侵略行爲，繼則謂日本之經濟及軍事力極爲薄弱，使美國民認對日戰爭易於進行。但由於太平洋上之苦戰與迭次戰敗。乃使美國民抗戰心理發生動搖而陷於極大混亂。然目前大東亞方面如緬甸菲律賓已相繼獨立，中日及日泰亦先後締結盟約，此與過去英美支配時代比較，全爲具有革命性之變化與發展，尤其大東亞會議及東亞共同宣言雖受英美方面種種誹謗，然大東亞會議與其宣言終已對全世界闡明大東亞各國如何相互尊重積極協力防禦大東亞共同之仇敵英美建設大東亞，決非戰爭終了後之空頭支票，且刻正着着實現，此即賦與該宣言以無限之權威者。最近渝行政院副院長孔祥熙及自美國返國未久之中國評論家林語堂等，雖於抗戰現階段，然由於東亞民族之自覺，彼等演說中對英美已有新的批評。開羅會談乃英美因於軍事上既受深刻打擊，復受東亞共同宣言之刺　而舉行者。由於此次會議，英美戰爭目的之眞相及益形暴露，蓋英美曾公然表明以奪取日本領土，使日本永居三等國之地位爲戰爭目的，亦即彼等須先打倒大東亞共同防衛中樞之日本，俾使全東亞民族復歸其蹂躪。英美常痛感最妨害彼等支配獨占東亞省，乃日本之實力，故企圖傾全力以破壞日本之實力。彼等每言打倒日本，對於已被日本解放之大東亞各民族究採如何之措置，則緘口不言，蓋彼等企圖於破壞日本實力後，仍將此等大東亞各民族置於其壓制下也。英美國因感對日作戰極爲困難，且須　於長期化，乃拉致渝方供其犧牲。開盤會議所表現者，唯有英美對大東亞無厭侵略之野心，彼等爲恢復侵略，首須打倒日本，並企圖以東亞民族供其犧牲。吾人既已明瞭英美破壞東亞之野心，故深感大東亞民族更加强共同防衛之必要，同時爲世界人類和平與福祉計，亦必須打破其非望，故吾人擊滅英美之戰亦愈益昂揚。</p>
<h3>開羅會議與　土耳其態度</h3>
<p>伊斯丹埠九日中央社電　據海通社訊：土京人士指陳土總統與美總統及英首相在開羅舉行之談話，不過爲繼續今春阿達那會議，及土外長曼奈門卓格魯與英外相艾登前此在開羅進行之談話而已。阿達那會議後，土耳其武裝中立政策未曾有所變更，則此次開羅會談之後，結果仍當如是。開羅會議公報措辭之誠摯，固未足使人驚異，蓋英土原訂有盟約，蘇土友善條約亦已有多年歷史，而美土之間，雖無正式條約存在，然兩國關係亦素稱友密。此一公報，適足表示土國以本身利益爲前提之武裝中立政策，正與英美蘇之希望相符合也。土總統伊斯美之赴開羅，亦不過爲使業已明白確定之土國外交政策加以擴大而已。</p>
<h3>外交接洽　甚爲忙碌</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦來電稱：反軸心國及土耳其之政治領袖，在開羅舉行之正式會議結束後，與會之政治家及外交家又曾交換意見。英外相艾登曾晤南斯拉夫與希臘流亡政府之首領·及南王彼得·希王喬治。</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹九日中央社電　據開羅消息：英首相邱吉爾行經近東與中東時，曾與英駐叙利亞大臣史比爾少將·伊拉克攝政阿部杜利拉·及義大利顧問議會英會員麥克密倫等會晤，並聞蘇聯駐土大使維諾格拉杜夫在開羅時，亦曾與義大利顧問議會蘇會員維辛斯基有所討論</p>
<h3>日美交涉回憶錄</h3>
<p>崩潰中的美國　野村大使談感想</p>
<p>十一月廿八日，想起兩年前醞　戰端風雲的日美交涉完全決裂了，往返於華盛頓的最後外交折衝，援助我提督大使野村大將的來栖大使，飛渡太平洋直達敵國首都，經過一旬又一旬，都處於進退維谷的地步，到了二十六日交下最後通牒，把戰前沉寂的光景，緊緊地壓在太平洋上，從那以後的兩年，眞比兩世紀還要長遠，這種歲月，轉瞬間已成過支，眞珠灣上的砲聲隆隆，轟動了太平洋的南北兩岸，當時的主脚野村大將，於二十五日早晨在神奈川縣片瀨叮新建的別墅中，使着溫和的雙眼，發出烱烱的光輝，發表當囘時的憶與今日的感想，茲摘錄於左——</p>
<p>美國人的想像</p>
<p>他們認爲攻擊眞珠灣是一種欺騙行爲，直到那時的外交交涉，都是拖延的計畫，捉住開戰的好機，他們批評是日本戰略的先驅，來栖大使的來援，如果是作手勢的玩意兒，那麼派我來做大使也是一種謀略了，美國人有這麼一套的說法，它們這種想像，是任意胡思亂想，不關痛癢的，但這時的我，爲著日本大義各分起見，很想明自說出，那時我直到最後還是傾向在和平的努力呢我僅僅地是個海軍軍人，並不知道外交上的討價還價。</p>
<p>僅僅地做着駐美大使而出國的時候，如果不必戰爭可以了事，還算萬幸，倘甚至開戰，我覺得太對不住國民了，所以徹頭徹尾爲着這事盡了全力，請派來栖君與若杉君都來幫忙，這都是我的希望，假如日美會談得到成功，我們何妨出任調停德英兩國的糾紛以謀解決呢，我們甚至談到了這種地步呀！</p>
<p>美國在兩年以前，還沒有預備戰爭，正在把五五三的優勢比率再要增加二倍的優勢，爲着這事正在忙亂之中，尤其是我有會談的情形，早已想到特別在石井藍辛協定成立的當時，我在美國認爲美國對於兩大正面戰爭準備很不充分，確實有下手的辦法，而敵人雖知道有若干不利的情形，如果決計開戰，這種氣迫是支持着。他接着说——</p>
<p>所謂互讓精神</p>
<p>口裏時當掦言着「Give　And　Take」所謂互讓精神，但是一聲到了眞正互賭利害的關頭，正式談判的時候，却一點點的「Give」（讓與）也不肯放鬆，這是美國式的脾氣，抱著開拓家的精神，從美國東部進至四部，再渡過太平洋的波　，往中國大陸登岸，揭起門戶開放的招牌，從列國權益中分得若干肥肉，然後慢慢地從下面來反對日本的對華政策了，從使權雖少，而一度撮取的權益，決不得離開它的金圈，這便是它們的根本方針—這一切的情形就是大東亞戰爭的胚子，由萌芽而至於滋蔓，由微風細雨而成爲狂風暴雨了。</p>
<p>南洲與海舟的交涉中，所謂大肚皮遇着大肚皮，實在碰着實在，只要對頸不相逢，如果冤家碰在一起，到底也沒有打開的途徑吧。所以美國人常說—「雖不願意戰爭，但方針並不錯，要幹便幹吧，橫直對手是那有限的日本呢！」—這種氣焰便昂揚起來，既然幹起來了，縱令不免許多蹉跌，而敵人美國也不得容易停戰吧。他又接着說—</p>
<p>這事可以看看美國的戰史，在經過七年的獨立戰爭，不知道打了許多敗戰，而它們畢竟戰鬥到底，無論多少敗仗，它們也不至灰心喪氣吧。</p>
<p>在我們只要保持勝利到底，要使敵人喪失戰意，除此以外別無他途，在這兩年間的日本，實際上是一氣跑到了百年的巨步，但只要這次戰勝，才能成立大東亞共榮國，要得到勝利才能完成聖戰，我們的利箭，已經射出於弦外了，離弦的利箭，除了射穿標的以外，再沒有別的辦法，對於元寇時的決心，那安如磐石決無煩惱的大精神，希望都在我們一億民衆的胸底裏沸騰起來一齊向前進取吧。</p>
<p>回憶赫爾覺書</p>
<p>來栖大使談感想</p>
<p>十一月二十六日又到了，在兩年以前的今日，野村，來栖兩大使接到了美國國務卿赫爾交下類似最後通牒的非法對日通吿的日子，兩年前的今日，野村，來栖兩大使，從午後四時四十五分直到六時與赫爾會見，以前在二十五日，赫爾邀集英國駐美大使哈里法克斯，重慶駐美大使胡適，還有澳洲，荷蘭公使等人開了秘密會議，隨後又召集戰時閣議，二十六日向日本提出覺書以前，又由大總統羅斯福本人邀集重慶代表宋千文與荷蘭公使等會談，美國政府對日挑戰的一切準備，至此已吿完成，於是所謂赫爾覺書才交了出來，帝國正正堂堂的主張作日美交涉最後奮鬥的來栖大使，於二十五日先後三時與新聞記者會見，把日美交涉的眞相，加以諄諄的說明，在日美交涉中美國的挑戰態度徹底指摘起來，希望一億國民奮起圖之。</p>
<p>誘導開戰成功</p>
<p>從日美交涉歸來以後，現在遇着第二次的十一月二十六日是，感慨更深，那時與野村大使同時接到那所謂覺書，看過一遍，覺得大失所望，同時認爲「這是一件大事」在日美國交前途上感到莫大的憂慮，—</p>
<p>就從來發表的「戰爭與和平」那白皮書上看來，那時美國對於日美交涉決計破裂，是很明顯的情形，我當時覺得如果這事傳到日本國內，不知發生怎樣的感想，那內容上的中國及安南的撤兵問題，與夫脫離三國聯盟的問題，都要傳達到日本嗎？我覺得這是非切實考慮不可，這麼答覆了一下呢。</p>
<p>第二天又與野村大使同去會晤羅斯福與赫爾，並促其反省，但赫爾的態度却很奇怪，對於我所指　的處所，也不大答辯，只是狂嘯着——「在美國方面鑒於今日的事態，只好把美國政府最初的主張，在這裡反復說明而已。」但後來它們發表的羅巴資委員會報吿的情形，與那照例的「戰爭與和平」及彷佛相等的公文集　，據赫爾本身也認爲交涉完結了，當時對於美國陸海軍幹部，也說明了交涉破裂的情形，第二天又向英國駐美大使表明這種意思，向日本挑戰的情形，於是更爲明暸了。他又接着說—</p>
<p>我接到覺書大爲失望的就是對於十一月二十日我方提案的囘答，我方的提案是　其公正的情形，大家都知道，常時問題中心的將安南南部的駐兵移至北部，護步到了這種程度，所以二十日以後美國當然認爲由香港與馬尼拉方面，月底的日美交涉，可以發見成功的曙光，至少也得成立暫時協定，那時到處傳播着這種消息呢。</p>
<p>國務院的意見</p>
<p>在華盛頓方面，也傳說紛紛，國務院內對於日本的提案是否可以妥協，分出軟硬兩派，連日開會討論着，有這麼個報吿，還在宋子文偕中國駐美大使胡適與羅斯福會見以後，那情形便慢慢地惡化起來，當時有這樣的宣傳。</p>
<p>又於二十二日與野村大使同訪赫爾於其私宅，那時赫爾本身說出一種消息—「無論怎樣也不可不辦的美國國內的意見，這是出於萬不得已的情形。」</p>
<p>但據我的推想，當時瀕瀕地提　强硬的論調可說是英美兩國，爲什麼呢，那時所謂ABCD各國代表，時常召開會議，荷蘭與中國，可由英美加以適當的處理，處於這種情勢之下，尤其是中國代表，在第一次會議之後，招請中國代表去商量的，這話也是由赫爾口中說出來的，至於澳洲公使，更說—「如果把這事就此擱置起來，那可糟了。」它說的是澳洲的立塲，表明它心中的不安，後來又訪英國大使哈里法克斯，　法怎樣打開局面，哭訴了一塲，直切了當地被它鎭壓了，在澳洲當然是反對戰爭的，所以我認爲主張日美開戰的是美國一部分唱高調的人們，於此可以推想而知。在開戰以後，我所得到的情報，據說進到戰爭狀態的時候，羅斯福向它親近的人們揚言說—「這才把日本擱在它自己所要　的位置，把日本擱在非與美國開戰不可的地位，才算辦到了。」這種情形，我想也是應有的事實，最近對於美國政府戰爭指導部說美國戰爭的目的毫不明顯，表示不滿，它們便焦急起來，考慮一種說法—「這次的戰爭是日本開始的，請囘想珍珠港的轟炸吧。」現在我所說的情形，是知道美國國民怎樣受着現在美國戰爭指導部的愚弄呢。</p>
<p>不能忘懷的一月</p>
<p>我對於十一月這個月是不能忘懷的月分，一則十一月五日是我飛往美國的一天，第二是二十六日，這十一月五日是召開大東亞會議，發表歷史上有價值的大東亞宣言，我在那會議旁聽，但比其他任何人感激尤深，會議席上的菲律賓大總統勞勒爾，還有自由印度臨時政府主席昌德拉鮑斯，它們更感激得淚流不止，我出席了許多會議，而那種感激涕零的會議，確是頭一遭，美國隱瞞了玻根維爾島海空戰日本所得的大戰果，同樣又把這大東亞會議的眞相與宣言也都隱瞞起來，至少還得製造反宣傳，徒使美國子弟遠在太平洋　癘多端之區，不知喪失了無數萬人。像海藻一般的傾倒在洪　巨浪之中，如果美國國民知道了這種慘狀，一定成爲國內的大問題吧。</p>
<p>美國國民的一部分，認爲像華盛頓與林肯那樣的人物還存在的時候，一定要發生問題的，因此，美國政府隱瞞　根維爾的敗戰與大東亞的宣言，總之，它們的想像，只要有力量便行了，用力量來鎭壓勝利的手腕，所以我們無論如何不能不在此一戰獲勝，前綫的勇猛奮鬬，得到大戰果，後方國民也要一致團結，各盡職責一齊邁進，實爲必要之　。</p>
<p>來栖大使暫時緘默起來，我們詢問赫爾交下覺書的時候是怎樣的態度，於是它又繼續發表談話。</p>
<p>我們遭了軟禁以後，在正月看見紐約時報華盛頓支局長，即赫爾維　的消息家克羅克寫了一段記事說—「實際上說來赫爾也不想交出那種覺書，赫爾的意思還要稍許把日美交涉遷延下去，以便在這時完成戰備呢。」或許這是眞相吧，美國想打倒德國之後，再來收拾日本，所以這種考慮也在所難免，這是我對於美國人時常是這麼個說法，華盛頓會議也是如此，這會議所　，是東亞的安定，但在運用上，時常給與使日本屈服的印象呢。</p>
<p>對於中國也是這樣的指導辦法，只要依靠美國就能幹得下去，英美本身在一九二七年實行砲轟南京，但在華府會議以後，中國全般排外運動，僅僅地向日本發動，那最有趣的事情，我往美國去的途上，當時馬尼拉的高等外務官塞雅發了一篇議論，據說美國的外務事務官精通東方事情的人們完全與它的見解相同—</p>
<p>「我到華盛頓，十一月十七日與野村大使同道去會晤羅斯福的時候，同席的赫爾說日本政府沒有信用，我說日本對於美國根本也不相信，前次歐戰的時候，日本極力協助美國，不圖在巴黎會議，美國因山東問題對於日本大肆攻擊，如果說沒有信用的，那麼，這次的交涉，美國在交涉成功以後要怎麼樣這也不知道，打倒德國之後，再不來收拾日本，是否有任何保障，這麼說了一大堆，赫爾聽到這話，簡直默默無言呢。」</p>
<p>羅斯福的論調</p>
<p>羅斯福到這時才說對於中日問題肯作居中調停人，但結局後來赫爾及國務院一部分的人們大加反對，這事便變爲畫餅。接到赫爾的覺書第二天，我與野村大使同去會晤羅斯福，那時羅斯福　在赫爾覺書上附帶著說日本軍力有向南方展開的情形吧，我說日本的與論頗形强硬，所以這時美國的立塲應該加以說明，總之，無論任何國家，爲着確保安全起見，縱令寸土，也得進而防備，英國對於星嘉坡豈不時常增强防禦嗎，美國於十一月二十四日占領巴西的舊荷蘭屬地基阿那又是什麼用意呢，雖說日本與論硬化，在我抵美的時候，美國上院外交委員主張把來栖拋棄在大西洋當中，壓碎日本這種種的風說，是美國與論的强硬態度，豈不也大有可觀嗎，在戰前十一月三日美國駐日大使格　的報吿到美，美國政府立時召開會議，爲着昂揚戰爭準備的意識，決定舉行政府當局的露天演說，後來　克斯的演說戰在美國政府的白皮書上所謂「戰爭與和平」，非難日本的美國，試問—「你們到底要怎樣？」此外我們再也不想說了。（　：譯白十一月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>燃料問題</h3>
<p>知道最近上海黑巿煤球賣到什麼價錢一　，柴斤贊到什麽價錢一百斤，電力煤氣的使用量受到什麽程度的縮减，就可以知道本巿的燃料問說，巳到如何嚴重的關頭了！</p>
<p>上次歐洲大戰道了最后一二年，主要交戰國無不感到燃料問題的嚴重性，並不亞於糧念問題，甚或過之，因為」巧婦離為無米之炊」固是眞理，而「巧歸難為無薪之炊」，夏屬千眞萬確，無怪通俗稱勞力酬報為」薪水」，而並不稱為「米水」或『粉水』，其意義或即在此。</p>
<p>燃料發生問題之原因，大致在產地則為生產减少，在產地與銷地之間則為運輸交通之不暢。聞華北謀產减少之原因在於礦工之减少，而礦工减少之原因，則又在於糧食之發生問題。因此，糧極的方法自在努力於礦工之增產與運輸之疏通，而消極的辦法、則為全體民衆之力自撙節燃料消費量，並儘晨採用燃料替代品喝如　紙破本之類，以代煤球。此外，住戶飭省電流、早眠早起，亦不失為廣義的節省燃料，使煤的消耗，减縮至最低限度，藉以維持燃料對於民衆日常之供應。</p>
<h3>各工廠原料問題　商定具體辦法　麵粉廠等調整生產</h3>
<p>本巿大小型工廠，實為維持滬上經濟之一份子，然近月以來，由於原料之不足，大抵在縮小範圍或休業狀態中，此項情形，影響本市繁華非淺，故關係當局，業巳商定且　辦法。據記者探悉，各小型工廠之原料問題，一部分均已獲得解決。茲誌概况如下：</p>
<p>麵粉等家已獲配給麵粉廠方面將以採買所得小麥入百萬袋，由麥粉統配處配給與各麵粉，以便　製麵粉供作民食。</p>
<p>榨油出產每日百擔</p>
<p>同時油糧委會方面巳將蘇浙皖三省收買所得之油糧原料，滴量配給於各榨油工廠，目前每日平均約出產百　左右。</p>

<h3>廣田情報部長評　反軸心會議　日方已以莫大戰國答覆</h3>
<p>中央社訊日本大使館上海事務所，定例招待本市中國新聞記者團報這常會，昨（九）日下午三時假華　飯店舉行，大使館方面計到廣田情報部長，福間副領事等、即席由廣田部長詳論反軸心會議之失收因素·特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>癡人說夢</p>
<p>廣田情報部長首謂本年十一月下句，反軸心方面在開羅及德黑蘭舉行之會談、參加者計有美總統羅斯福，英首相邱吉爾·渝政權蔣介石等三人·根埠彼　所發表之文告而觀，竟大言不慚·謂在東亞戰爭度得勝　　，將　取日本領土之企圖，並壓迫日木降低三等國家地位，我日本對彼發會談之答覆，在東條首相之劉切　講中，　　　明，現，我人已定為決戰年、東條　相所披　之決意，及日木方面發展大規　之攻勢、巳在南方太平洋海空作戰上明白答覆，如波根維爾島，馬紹爾島，吉爾貝特軍島之海空大戰，日本已獲得莫大之戰果，故足以囘答反軸心之開羅會議，再如反軸心方面企圖奪囘緬甸之作戰計劃，我們亦巳報覆，於本月七日，日本學行之大攻勢，在印加爾各答及湘省常得為中心之作戰，亦巳獲得大勝，此巳答覆反軸心之企圖奪回緬如作戰，故我人對此種開羅會議之　語，殊不顧言之，蓋我人所給予證明　　乃為具體之戰果。</p>
<p>洞悉其奸</p>
<p>許　德黑關會談之內容，亦無具體內容，彼輩　發表之文告所言，謂為打敗德國之前，彼此討論一切意見，然此項內容之發表，以往在十月下句，於莫斯科英美蘇之首領會談時，亦有此同樣之內容，以及魁北克會談，華盛頓，卡薩布蘭卡會談會淡，莫不類同，尤其在朱開會之前，我人早巳洞悉其奸，是以德國方面始終未為屈服，且更發揮强大戰　力量，同時我人對此種會誤，彼輩之目的，乃使土耳其之參戰，更利用土之領土，攻擊巴爾幹各　，是以我人觀察彼輩之作戰，如過去對意大利之作戰，九月八日巴特里政權無條件降和，為期至今巳三閱月，在此期內，反軸心所發展之面積，僅百公哩左右，是以尤無特別之進展，故彼單之欲攻擊巴爾幹作戰，我人可斷定不敢進攻，亦不敢作戰，總之德黑　會議，幷無特別注意者，彼輩之召集此種會議，無異在獅子作　時，等於兎子之集會，　難發生效力。</p>

<h3>介紹一個學生食堂　節省金錢和時間</h3>
<p>四川路靑年會學生食堂·該會在樓上十分僻靜的一隅。內有二十多只皚白的臺子，和百來隻登子，椅子，以及潔淨的筷子，碟子等。至於用膳手續，也很簡便，只要在販臺前付丁飯資，就可以自動取食了。雖然化了九元五角的代價，遲到的倒油三晚　豆飯，一碟菜，一碗湯</p>
<p>我覺得學生食堂，除了供給我們經濟，淸潔而富有營養的飯菜外，其一到就吃的方法，使我們無庸等待。過去我在普通飯店就食，至少要等一二刻鐘，有時還不見菜來。細細算來，如果每養業一刻鐘，每日兩餐要浪費半小時，全年竟無形中虛度一百八十二小時半。以每小時讀書三十百計算，若每天在學生食堂用膳·一年可以多看四五十部有益的書籍，這是多　　人的一個統計數字　！明之）</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>眞人·很茁壯地成長看。</p>
<p>孩子們鐘大多不用操心，很順利地成長着·可是像眞人著樣省事的却沒有·四　很溫和，但常息痢疾，使人放心不下·眞人雖然不很特別的肥胖，奇怪的，沒有虫子·也沒有　過吐子·索乳的時候·就的　　來，　飽了便安靜的　覺。着的時候，獨自　着自巳的手兒玩·不過三個月的工夫便開始會　了。</p>
<p>他是一個喜歡第的孩子。白　　、細眼　·眼角下　着。確是他母親的遺傳。鮮紅的嘴　·輕　的閉着，好像他的父親。任何人見着·都要堆下笑容來的·可愛的嬰兒。而且即使見到陌生人。也嘻嘻地笑着，所以時常要使人　認他是一個女孩兒。</p>
<p>「　，可愛的孩子將來給你聖個好媳婦兒。</p>
<p>常滿子負着眞人，在馬路上遊戲　，從身旁經過的婦人也有逗眞人說着這樣的話。</p>
<p>三歲做生日那天，母親抱着暖人參拜了村社的八幡社，這年，若子又生了她第十二個孩子眞彥。愈日得忙碌了，然而十五拜　　沒有缺過。她換上了有紋章的　服，穿進了基幹六　的石牌坊。　重的　了手·漱了口·進到拜股前面，作長時間的祈　。她並不同神求願付麼，只是誠心誠意的　禱着。尤其生了男孩兄的時候。每次都這樣長時間的祈禱着。</p>
<p>荒田八　宮、是很有歷史的　宇，現在的　殿，係島津十五代城，王貴久所建築的，祭祀的由來也很悠久了。九月二十三日的廟會。有遊海的儀式，確是　兒島的勝會之一，而現在巳竟廢棄了。不過，傳說　股下邊的白砂，可以驅除毒蛇的習俗，到現在仍然還流傳着。古書中載着，「本社嚴嫌　蛇，故　田一村絕無其虫」。事實上此地附近蛇類的確很少。鄕民們對於這土地寺的信仰，確相當的　爲，眞人、後來作了海軍軍人，每逢歸省鄕里，總不忘來禮拜的。</p>
<p>眞人，在五截的生日，也穿着棉布製的有　童的禮服，來參拜過，眞彥生後三個月，即天折了，可是在那年八男末雄誕生了。也許是末　的名字，發生了効力，若子長期間生育的生活，到此便停止了。及至眞人七歲　辰的時候，世間的形勞，却有了很大的變化，發生空前的關東大地雲。東京開始有收音機了。又在近之前、　奧和長門兩艦，同時出現於日本海上。</p>
<h3>評「樑上君子」</h3>
<p>在巴黎大　院的　　的池座中，看完了苦　劇團為本報請者助學金長期義演的第二劇目「　上君子」，　得簡直令人氣都透不過來。</p>
<p>這　沒有曲折的情節，却有完美而巧妙的結　，恰如一副精緻的七巧板，以各種不同的形體，湊合在一起。作為全劇的樞　的，紙是一個「命」字。包三的　塲君子，開宗明義，固非人人知道他是　茍　營之輩：而要律師的勾結包三，　名欺世；白秘書和愛蘭的陳倉暗渡，竊玉倫　：大　子巡長和夏大太的密約幽期，乃至馬露西的素　，尸位，無一不吻合一個「倫」字，因而刻劃出一種錯盡錯絕，令人失笑的人生的　畫。「　上君子」的作者是無情的，他以巧妙的手法，對我們這明偷暗竊的社會作了幸辣諷刺，觀衆在　　解　之餘，切不可被他騙過。</p>
<p>苦幹劇團在演出上的成功，怕是誰也不能抹煞的吧、在劃壇上幾位名導演中，　仞之先生是以細膩著名的，而佐臨先生所迫求的，顯然在醒目和明助、色彩的鮮明，節奏的流暢，令人無限愉快。</p>
<p>演員的貢獻更其可觀。女的如林彬，林榛。（她多麼　，然而又多麽甜！）丹尼，男的如白程，史原·王駿·企洛·石揮·眞令人有「棋逢敵手·將遇良子」之感。企洛比在「飄」中的成績，其通一步是很顯然的，雖然比較知下，海略微覺得　一點，而忘駿的演技，這裏似滬更趨向了圖熱。</p>

<h3>Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the first day of the lecture series jointly organized by the Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Committee and the Shanghai News Federation. Mr. Chen Binhe was invited to give a lecture at the Grand China Theater. Due to the limited time, a detailed account was not possible, so a brief summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Since returning from Japan this time, I have given several presentations on the actual conditions in Japan during wartime. Today, I would like to discuss the general situation regarding production and aviation.</p>
<p>There is a slogan in Japan called "War and Production as One," which means that warfare and production are one and the same, not two separate things. Because the needs of warfare naturally increase production efficiency, while at the same time, saving all materials not directly related to warfare and dedicating them to the needs of warfare is of utmost importance. Even peacetime materials must now be used to twice, or even three to five times their original effectiveness. For the sake of warfare, the efficiency of production and the effectiveness of materials have been stimulated. Therefore, it is called "War and Production as One." Relying on this power, they have absolute confidence in defeating the United States and Britain, whether on land, sea, or air.</p>
<p>Let me give a practical example! Japan adjusts manpower in the production sector, so that men, women, old and young, all use their available strength, through comprehensive planning. It is planned that from mid-January of next year, the government will stipulate seventeen types of simple occupations, such as clerical assistance in document receiving and dispatching, cash transactions, shop assistants, bill collectors, attendants, etc., which men will not be allowed to hold, and will be completely replaced by women. This is a major change in the job industry, which may seem unnecessary at first glance. However, upon closer examination, removing a large number of men to take on more important production work will undoubtedly make a greater contribution. And women can also contribute their labor and service, which can be described as a general mobilization of manpower.</p>
<p>There is also a factory called Ozaki Seiko Factory. The authorities wanted to use disabled people for work, so they hired a dozen deaf-mutes to grind diamonds. The results of the trial showed that in the first three months, during the teaching and learning period, the work was inferior to that of ordinary people, and the teaching was also more difficult. However, after four months, they gradually surpassed ordinary people. For example, the product success rate of healthy workers was only 85%, while the deaf-mutes achieved 95%. Having achieved such good results, the factory hired dozens more deaf-mutes, and now has more than eighty deaf-mute workers.</p>
<p>The above is about manpower adjustment and the utilization of the disabled. However, not only that, but each person is also trained as much as possible to have multiple abilities, so that one person can produce the effect of several people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they carefully study the American aircraft shot down by Japan, from the structure to the equipment, to thoroughly understand them. They found that the aiming devices and wireless telegraphs of American aircraft were not as sophisticated as those of Japan. However, "radar weapons" were widely used and exquisite in American aircraft. Therefore, Japanese technicians worked hard and the army and navy jointly organized the "Radio Wave Research Institute" to improve them. At the same time, factories also worked hard to increase the quantity of production. What originally took a year to complete can now be done in half a month. Even school students organized "Radio Wave Student Patriotic Teams" to help the factories and workers work together.</p>
<p>Japanese pilot training actually begins in middle school, and is conducted in a private tutor style. From take-off and landing to various combat techniques, one or two instructors teach six fully functional skills. American pilots, on the other hand, specialize in one skill. Those who can use the front seat machine gun cannot use the rear machine gun. Secondly, a Japanese aircraft flies continuously from morning to noon to dusk, which is equivalent to the use of three or four aircraft. In this way, one thousand pilots and one thousand aircraft are at least equivalent to the effectiveness of three thousand American pilots and three thousand aircraft. This is not just empty talk, and there have already been considerable examples.</p>
<p>The four words "frugality and thrift" are also earnestly practiced in Japan. It is common to eat two bowls instead of three, and even wealthy families eat vegetables and light meals. Wearing new clothes is considered trivial, while wearing old clothes is considered honorable.</p>
<p>In addition, the spirit of fighting fills the entire nation, and the heroic and moving deeds are touching. The young students who go on expeditions truly have a determination to die, and are willing to fight the enemy on the battlefield. They say: "Those who come after us, step on our bloodstains, cross over our corpses, bravely advance, defeat the enemy, destroy the enemy!" Their spirit is truly overwhelming! And the students who remain in school say: "We must now be the best students, and in the future be the strongest soldiers."</p>
<p>Finally, let us calmly think about it. If the country demands progress and the people demand progress, then all the good examples of Japan are worth learning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack New Guinea, Sinking Three Torpedo Boats, Tumbi Airfield Heavily Damaged by Bombing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain location in the South Pacific under Japanese military control reports that Japanese naval aircraft units attacked enemy troops near Finschhafen on the 5th, destroying two land positions and sinking one enemy torpedo boat in nearby waters. Additionally, Japanese naval seaplane units attacked enemy torpedo boat groups in the Tumbier Strait during the same night, sinking two of them, with no losses on the Japanese side.</p>

Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 7th, Japanese aircraft units bombed Kamu Yabu, approximately 230 kilometers southwest of Wewak, setting eight locations on fire. A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in the South Pacific reports that during the month from October 20th to November 20th, Japanese forces operated in the area near Hwanxi Ridge, approximately five kilometers south of Madang, New Guinea, on the left bank of the Ramu River, achieving the following comprehensive results: 372 enemy soldiers were left dead, and the total number of enemy casualties exceeded one thousand.

<h3>German Foreign Minister Visits Japanese Embassy, Unity Between the Two Nations Will Be Further Strengthened</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited the Japanese Embassy in Germany on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, telling Japanese residents that the German people sincerely congratulate the Japanese army on its brilliant achievements over the past two years, and vow to firmly join hands with the Japanese people until final victory is achieved. Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima also expressed his firm determination in this regard. In addition, the Japanese-German and German-Italian associations will jointly host a celebration of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 11th. The unity between Japan and Germany will be further strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Receives German Reporters</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Germany Lieutenant General Oshima gave a speech at the embassy here on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, expressing his belief in German-Japanese cooperation in building a new world order. He stated that two years ago, on December 8, Japan took up arms in response to countless challenges from the British and Americans, and finally dealt a major blow to the enemy at Pearl Harbor. Today, he mentioned the achievements of the brave soldiers of the allied nations on all fronts and praised the diligence of the entire German nation in the rear, fulfilling their responsibilities in this struggle related to world destiny, and not wavering in their determination due to unconscious and barbaric aerial terror attacks.</p>
<p>Japan can also look back on several major battles and victories. The god of fate smiles upon the Japanese army, distributed within a radius of 5,000 kilometers, enabling Japan to begin implementing the principles of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>The wars in East Asia and Europe are continuing, and the enemy is constantly trying to retaliate against us, but these attempts will undoubtedly be crushed in the face of our unwavering determination to continue fighting. I have the firm belief that the heroic peoples of Japan and Germany are bound together by fate to jointly establish a new world order, and this belief is the most reliable guarantee of our final victory.</p>
<p>During the reception, Ambassador Oshima had a very pleasant conversation with a famous German reporter, and agreed with the reporter's opinion that the British administration in East Asia suffers from an anachronistic illness, not only now but also in the past. Since Japan rose in East Asia as a world power, the inability to continue this policy has long been a matter of time. Based on this, Japan's victory can be called a natural law.</p>
<p>Ambassador Oshima pointed out that the recognition of Japan as their leader by the various ethnic groups in East Asia stems from their free will and is certainly for their own benefit. He also questioned whether the Chinese people under Chiang Kai-shek's rule have different views from other East Asian people, saying that people must know that Chiang Kai-shek can no longer represent the true will of the Chinese people. Ambassador Oshima further traced back to the principles of Japan's establishment of the new East Asia policy, saying that the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is the most ideal modern treaty, with complete equality of rights.</p>
<p>Regarding the Cairo Conference communiqué, Ambassador Oshima strongly criticized the anti-Axis demands on Japan as contradictory, especially regarding the actual situation in the Pacific, which they completely ignored. For example, the huge losses suffered by the United States at Pearl Harbor two years ago and the losses in the Pacific in the past few weeks are irreparable during the war. It is strange that British and American propaganda is exactly the opposite. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also attended this grand reception.</p>
<p>German Newspapers Praise Japanese Military Achievements</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, German newspapers published numerous articles on the morning and evening of the 7th, praising the Japanese army's amazing victories in the South Pacific and its strength in advancing the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. One German newspaper commentary stated that the Japanese government has not only taken the offensive militarily, but also politically and diplomatically, enabling countries groaning under the oppression of Britain and the United States to gain national autonomy and actively engage in the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. This is sufficient to prove the seriousness of the Axis's position.</p>
<h3>US Flame Unit Suffers Heavy Losses in Tarawa Landing Battle</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 9th (Central News Agency) – An American war correspondent reported on the 6th that two-thirds of the US flame-throwing unit had been wiped out during the landing on Tarawa Island. It is said that when the US troops began landing on Tarawa Island, the boats were subjected to fierce artillery fire from the Japanese garrison upon reaching the coast, causing heavy casualties. Although the marines who reached the coast immediately organized their formations and formed teams, they had no other way to expel the Japanese troops from their strongholds except by using flame throwers. However, one of the flame-throwing unit's boats capsized within just twenty feet of the coast due to Japanese artillery fire, with only five survivors. The flame-throwing units that landed attacked the Japanese strongholds head-on, but each time they captured one stronghold, it took three days and nights of fierce attacks, resulting in two-thirds of the flame-throwing unit being decimated while attacking the Japanese strongholds on the island.</p>

<h3>Building a New East Asian Order with the New Oriental Spirit, Dr. Okawa Gives a Speech in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Asia Revitalization Envoy Dr. Okawa Shumei delivered a speech at the Asia Revitalization Speech Conference on the 8th. The main points of his speech are as follows: December 8 is not only a day to be commemorated forever by the Japanese people, but also by all ethnic groups in East Asia and even all nations in the world. The Greater East Asia War began on that day and a new era appeared in world history. The political changes in Greater East Asia over the past two years are truly a great miracle. This is the expulsion of British, American, and Dutch forces from East Asia, and the flag of freedom has already flown over Yangon, Manila, and even the future New Delhi. The recent holding of the Greater East Asia Conference and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration can be described as a major advancement and a major transformation in world history. The British and Americans, in order to re-invade East Asia, are still attempting to counterattack. Although the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, construction in the modern era is still advancing steadily. The independence of Burma and the Philippines, the participation in politics of Indonesia and Malaya, the adjustment of Thailand's territory, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty have laid the foundation for the political structure of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, we can only work hard on this foundation. Although the matter is great, it is also very difficult, so we can only guide this great historical undertaking with a great spirit. The great cause of building the New East Asian Order must also be based on a great spirit. The nature and significance of the Sino-Japanese Incident are now becoming increasingly clear with the progress of the war, that is, it still has the war goal and ideal of building a new East Asian order and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Sharing Life and Death, Striving to Practice</p>
<p>Now, at a time when the rise and fall of China and Japan are intertwined, we should resolve to strive to practice what Chairman Wang Jingwei said about sharing life and death. The so-called sharing of death means that China and Japan become slaves of Britain and the United States. The so-called sharing of life means building a new East Asian order with China and Japan as the center. Although the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already shown the outline of the New East Asian Order, this great historical movement, this basic spirit, I call the New Oriental Spirit. Its contents are: First, we should know the spirit of Oriental tradition, and especially should accurately understand the traditional spirit of China, India, and Japan. These spirits created their inherent material culture as early as ancient times, and many also made the world's human beings revive again. Second, we should understand the world view of the East Asian people, that is, to understand the relationship between the world and life. Third, we should promote the differences in the spirit of each nation and promote its unique culture. Fourth, we should create a new Oriental spirit, that is, we should create it on the basis of the general traditions of Asia. Fifth, we should integrate the political nationalism of the West and the principle of the cooperative society of the East into the new Oriental spirit. In this way, the new Oriental spirit will become a principle of the world. The principle of the cooperative society of the East lies in the mutual love of the whole, so it is a noble spiritual property contributed to the world. In addition to this, the new Oriental spirit should have a very strong political nature, that is, as for fighting to win liberation and independence, it goes without saying, but we must also continue to carry out anti-Western and anti-capitalist political struggles, so the new Oriental spirit is determined by tradition and politics. In today's situation, the content of the new Oriental spirit should first be anti-Western, second should be anti-capitalist, third should be nationalistic, and fourth should establish a pantheistic world view. Forming a system of thought with the above content is the new Oriental spirit. In the East Asian thought today, there are still many excellent essences, such as uncut jewels, so in this war of force and war of morality, we should work harder in the spirit of endeavor, and in the war of thought, we should work hard to research and explore. Polishing this unpolished jewel to create a brilliant new Oriental spirit.</p>
<h3>Dr. Okawa of Japan Visits the Chairman to Pay Respects</h3>

<h3>Chongqing Admits Heavy Losses Due to the Fall of Changde, US Air Force Attacks Prisoner of War Camp</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The fall of Changde by the Japanese army has indeed dealt a great blow to Chongqing. A Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 8th reported that the Chongqing Military Commission has announced the fall of Changde and admitted that it has suffered a major blow militarily and economically. After the fall of Changde, not only have the Japanese army opened the road to the Yangtze River, but Chongqing's grain-producing areas have also fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and the supply route between Hunan and Sichuan has also been cut off, so the relationship is very important. The Chongqing Military Commission also issued a war report on the 8th and admitted heavy losses, saying that the battle of Changde ended on the 3rd, and Chongqing's army suffered heavy losses. For example, the 57th Division had only 300 people left.</p>
<p>Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked the prisoner of war camp in Changde City at 1:00 PM on the 7th, killing and wounding several prisoners. The prisoners held in this prisoner of war camp were captured in the battle of Changde and the subsequent cleaning operations, totaling several thousand people. These prisoners are all outraged by the indiscriminate bombing of the US Air Force.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Holds Aircraft Dedication and Naming Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Japanese Information Minister Reveals British and American Ambitions in East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Iguchi, the Third Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with a group of reporters this afternoon. Regarding the Cairo Conference attended by British, American, and Chongqing representatives, he stated that over two years of experience in the Greater East Asia War has provided British and American leaders with two practical lessons: Firstly, Japan possesses strong combat capabilities in the Pacific and East Asia; Secondly, after breaking free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, the nations of Greater East Asia are united without any coercion. The war is not of vital importance to the survival of the American people, so the initiators of the American war must devise various strategies to involve the population. They initially claimed that the Japanese people were inherently warlike and that Japan's self-defense policy was an act of aggression. They then claimed that Japan's economic and military strength was extremely weak, leading Americans to believe that war with Japan would be easy. However, bitter battles and repeated defeats in the Pacific have caused the American public's anti-war sentiment to waver and fall into great confusion. Currently, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and China and Japan, as well as Japan and Thailand, have successively concluded alliances. Compared to the era of British and American domination, this represents a revolutionary change and development. In particular, although the Greater East Asia Conference and the Joint Declaration of East Asia have been subject to various slanders from Britain and the United States, the Greater East Asia Conference and its declaration have ultimately clarified to the world how the nations of Greater East Asia respect each other, actively cooperate to defend against the common enemies of Greater East Asia, Britain and the United States, and build Greater East Asia. This is not an empty promise to be fulfilled after the war, but is currently being realized, which gives the declaration unlimited authority. Recently, Kong Xiangxi, the Deputy President of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, and Lin Yutang, a Chinese critic who recently returned from the United States, have made new criticisms of Britain and the United States in their speeches, despite the current stage of the war against Japan, due to the awakening of East Asian nations. The Cairo Conference was held by Britain and the United States because they had suffered severe military setbacks and were stung by the Joint Declaration of East Asia. The truth about the war aims of Britain and the United States has been further exposed by this conference. Britain and the United States have openly stated that their war aims are to seize Japanese territory and make Japan a third-rate country forever, that is, they must first defeat Japan, the central hub of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that all East Asian nations can return to their oppression. Britain and the United States constantly lament that the greatest obstacle to their domination and monopoly of East Asia is Japan's strength, so they attempt to destroy Japan's strength with all their might. They constantly talk about defeating Japan, but remain silent on what measures they will take for the nations of Greater East Asia that have been liberated by Japan. They intend to place these nations of Greater East Asia under their oppression after destroying Japan's strength. Britain and the United States feel that fighting Japan is extremely difficult and must be prolonged, so they are dragging in the Chongqing side to serve as their sacrifice. The Cairo Conference revealed only the insatiable ambition of Britain and the United States to invade Greater East Asia. In order to restore their invasion, they must first defeat Japan and attempt to use the East Asian nations as their sacrifice. Since we have clearly understood the ambition of Britain and the United States to destroy East Asia, we deeply feel the need for the nations of Greater East Asia to strengthen their common defense. At the same time, for the sake of world peace and human well-being, we must also shatter their unreasonable desires. Therefore, our war to destroy Britain and the United States will become even more vigorous.</p>
<h3>Cairo Conference and Turkey's Attitude</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, people in Ankara pointed out that the talks held in Cairo between the Turkish President, the American President, and the British Prime Minister were merely a continuation of the Adana Conference held this spring, and the talks previously held in Cairo between the Turkish Foreign Minister, Menemencioğlu, and the British Foreign Secretary, Eden. After the Adana Conference, Turkey's policy of armed neutrality has not changed, so the outcome of this Cairo Conference should remain the same. The sincerity of the wording of the Cairo Conference communiqué is not surprising, as Britain and Turkey originally had an alliance, the Soviet-Turkish friendship treaty has a long history, and although there is no formal treaty between the United States and Turkey, the relations between the two countries have always been friendly. This communiqué adequately expresses Turkey's policy of armed neutrality, which is based on its own interests and is in line with the hopes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Turkish President İsmet's trip to Cairo was merely to expand Turkey's foreign policy, which has already been clearly defined.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Contacts Are Very Busy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, a dispatch from London stated that after the formal meeting of the anti-Axis powers and Turkish political leaders in Cairo concluded, the participating politicians and diplomats exchanged views. British Foreign Secretary Eden met with the leaders of the Yugoslav and Greek exiled governments, as well as King Peter of Yugoslavia and King George of Greece.</p>
<p>Amsterdam, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Cairo, British Prime Minister Churchill met with British Minister to Syria Major General Spears, Iraqi Regent Abdul Ilah, and British members of the Italian Advisory Council, such as Macmillan, while traveling through the Near East and the Middle East. It is also reported that Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov also had discussions with Soviet member of the Italian Advisory Council, Vyshinsky, in Cairo.</p>
<h3>Memoirs of Japanese-American Negotiations</h3>
<p>America in Collapse: Ambassador Nomura's Thoughts</p>
<p>November 28th. Recalling how, two years ago, the Japanese-American negotiations, pregnant with the storm of war, completely broke down. Ambassador Nomura, a Naval Admiral, shuttled back and forth in Washington in the final diplomatic wrangling. Ambassador Kurusu flew across the Pacific directly to the enemy's capital. Week after week, they were in a quandary. On the 26th, the final ultimatum was delivered, tightly suppressing the pre-war silence over the Pacific. These past two years seem even longer than two centuries. This kind of time has passed in an instant. The roar of cannons on Pearl Harbor shook the north and south shores of the Pacific. Admiral Nomura, the protagonist of that time, expressed his memories of that time and his thoughts today on the morning of the 25th at his newly built villa in Katase-cho, Kanagawa Prefecture, with gentle eyes and a bright radiance. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>American Imagination</p>
<p>They believe that the attack on Pearl Harbor was an act of deception, and that the diplomatic negotiations up to that point were a delaying tactic to seize the opportunity to start the war. They criticize it as the precursor to Japanese strategy. If Ambassador Kurusu's arrival was a mere gesture, then sending me as ambassador was also a plot. Americans have such a theory. This kind of imagination is arbitrary speculation and does not matter. But at this time, for the sake of Japan's great cause, I want to make it clear that I was still inclined to make peace efforts until the very end. I am merely a naval officer and do not know the diplomatic bargaining.</p>
<p>When I left the country as the ambassador to the United States, it would have been a great fortune if the matter could have been resolved without war. If war even broke out, I felt very sorry for the people. So I did my best to do this from beginning to end. I asked Kurusu and Wakasugi to come and help. These were all my hopes. If the Japanese-American talks had been successful, why shouldn't we have acted as mediators to resolve the disputes between Germany and Britain? We even talked about this!</p>
<p>Two years ago, the United States was not prepared for war. It was busy increasing the already advantageous ratio of 5:5:3 to twice that advantage. Especially since I had been involved in the talks, I had long thought that especially at the time when the Ishii-Lansing Agreement was concluded, I believed in America that the United States was not sufficiently prepared for a two-front war and that there was indeed a way to take action. And although the enemy knew that there were some unfavorable circumstances, if they decided to start a war, this kind of momentum was supporting them. He continued——</p>
<p>The So-called Spirit of Mutual Concession</p>
<p>They constantly shout about "Give and Take," the so-called spirit of mutual concession, but when it comes to the real interests at stake, they are unwilling to let go of even the smallest "Give" (concession). This is the American temperament. With the spirit of pioneers, they advanced from the eastern United States to the four regions, and then crossed the waves of the Pacific to land on the Chinese mainland, raising the banner of the open door policy, dividing some of the spoils from the interests of the nations, and then slowly opposing Japan's policy towards China from below. Although the ambassador's authority is small, the interests once seized must never leave its golden circle. This is their fundamental policy - all of this is the embryo of the Greater East Asia War, from germination to growth, from a gentle breeze to a storm.</p>
<p>In the negotiations between Nanzhou and Kaishu, the so-called "big belly meets big belly," reality meets reality. As long as their necks don't meet, if enemies bump into each other, there is no way to open up the situation. So the Americans often say - "Although we don't want war, the policy is not wrong. If we want to do it, let's do it. Anyway, the opponent is that limited Japan!" - This kind of arrogance has risen. Since it has started, even if there are many setbacks, the enemy America will not easily stop the war. He then continued——</p>
<p>This can be seen in American war history. After a seven-year war of independence, they fought many defeats, but they still fought to the end. No matter how many defeats, they will not be discouraged.</p>
<p>We only need to maintain victory to the end to make the enemy lose the will to fight. There is no other way. In these two years, Japan has actually taken a giant leap of a hundred years. But only by winning this war can we establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Only by achieving victory can we complete the holy war. Our arrow has already been shot from the string. The arrow that has left the string has no other way but to shoot through the target. For the determination of the Yuan Dynasty, that great spirit of peace of mind and no worries, I hope that all of our 100 million people will boil in their hearts and advance together.</p>
<p>Recalling the Hull Note</p>
<p>Ambassador Kurusu's Thoughts</p>
<p>November 26th has arrived again. Today, two years ago, Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu received the illegal notification to Japan, similar to an ultimatum, from US Secretary of State Hull. On this day two years ago, Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu met with Hull from 4:45 PM to 6:00 PM. Previously, on the 25th, Hull invited British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, Chongqing Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih, and the Australian and Dutch Ministers to hold a secret meeting. Then, he convened a wartime cabinet meeting. Before presenting the memorandum to Japan on the 26th, President Roosevelt himself invited Chongqing representative Song Ziwen and the Dutch Minister to meet. The US government's preparations for challenging Japan were now complete, and the so-called Hull Note was handed over. Ambassador Kurusu, who advocated the just and upright position of the Empire and made the final struggle in the Japanese-American negotiations, met with newspaper reporters three times on the 25th to explain the truth of the Japanese-American negotiations and thoroughly criticized the American challenge attitude in the Japanese-American negotiations, hoping that the 100 million people would rise up and work hard.</p>
<p>Successful Guidance to Start the War</p>
<p>Since returning from the Japanese-American negotiations, encountering the second November 26th, the emotion is even deeper. At that time, I received the so-called memorandum together with Ambassador Nomura. After reading it once, I was greatly disappointed and at the same time thought, "This is a big deal." I felt great worry about the future of Japanese-American relations.</p>
<p>Judging from the "War and Peace" White Paper that has been published, it is clear that the United States was determined to break down the Japanese-American negotiations. At that time, I felt that if this matter were to be transmitted to Japan, I don't know what kind of feelings would be generated. The issue of troop withdrawal from China and Annam and the issue of withdrawing from the Tripartite Pact, should they be transmitted to Japan? I felt that this had to be seriously considered, so I answered like that.</p>
<p>The next day, I went with Ambassador Nomura to meet with Roosevelt and Hull and urged them to reflect, but Hull's attitude was very strange. He didn't argue much about the places I pointed out, but just howled - "In view of today's situation, the United States can only repeat the original claims of the US government here." But later, the circumstances of the Robaz Committee report they published, and that routine "War and Peace" and similar collections of official documents, according to Hull himself, considered the negotiations to be over. At that time, he also explained the breakdown of the negotiations to the US Army and Navy officers, and the next day he expressed this intention to the British Ambassador to the United States. The circumstances of the challenge to Japan are now even clearer. He continued——</p>
<p>What disappointed me greatly when I received the memorandum was the reply to our proposal on November 20th. Everyone knows the just nature of our proposal. The central issue at all times was to move the troops stationed in southern Annam to the north, protecting them to this extent. Therefore, after the 20th, the United States naturally believed that the end-of-the-month Japanese-American negotiations could find a dawn of success from the direction of Hong Kong and Manila. At least a temporary agreement had to be established. At that time, this kind of news was spreading everywhere.</p>
<p>The Opinion of the State Department</p>
<p>In Washington, there were also many rumors. Within the State Department, opinions were divided into hardliners and softliners on whether Japan's proposal could be compromised. Meetings were held every day to discuss this. There was such a report that after Song Ziwen met with Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih and Roosevelt, the situation slowly deteriorated. At that time, there was such propaganda.</p>
<p>Also, on the 22nd, I visited Hull at his private residence with Ambassador Nomura. At that time, Hull himself revealed a piece of news - "The opinions of the US domestic, which cannot be avoided no matter what, are due to a situation of extreme necessity."</p>
<p>But according to my speculation, the strong tones that were constantly raised at that time could be said to be from Britain and the United States. Why? At that time, the so-called ABCD representatives often held meetings. Holland and China could be properly handled by Britain and the United States. Under these circumstances, especially the Chinese representatives, after the first meeting, they were invited to discuss the matter. This was also said by Hull. As for the Australian Minister, he even said - "If this matter is left aside, it will be terrible." He was talking about Australia's position, expressing the unease in his heart. Later, he also visited British Ambassador Halifax, crying about how to open up the situation, and was directly suppressed by him. Australia is naturally opposed to war, so I believe that it can be inferred that those who advocate the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States are a part of the American people who are singing high. After the outbreak of war, the information I received said that when the state of war was entered, Roosevelt declared to his close associates - "This is how we put Japan in the position it wanted to be in, putting Japan in a position where it had no choice but to start a war with the United States." I think this is also an expected fact. Recently, the American government's war guidance department has said that the purpose of the American war is not clear, expressing dissatisfaction. They became anxious and considered a statement - "This war was started by Japan. Please recall the bombing of Pearl Harbor." The situation I am talking about now is knowing how the American people are being fooled by the current American war guidance department.</p>
<p>An Unforgettable Month</p>
<p>I cannot forget the month of November. One reason is that November 5th was the day I flew to the United States. The second is the 26th. This November 5th was the day the Greater East Asia Conference was held and the historically valuable Greater East Asia Declaration was issued. I listened in on that conference, but I was more grateful than anyone else. Philippine President Laurel and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, Chandra Bose, were even more grateful to the point of tears. I have attended many meetings, but that kind of tearful meeting was definitely the first time. The United States concealed the great victory obtained by Japan in the Battle of Bougainville Island, and at the same time concealed the truth and declaration of this Greater East Asia Conference, and at least had to create counter-propaganda, merely causing countless tens of thousands of American children to lose their lives in the area of the Pacific that is full of epidemics. Like seaweed, they were poured into the torrents of the great waves. If the American people knew about this tragic situation, it would definitely become a big problem in the country.</p>
<p>A part of the American people believe that when figures like Washington and Lincoln still exist, problems will definitely arise. Therefore, the US government concealed the defeat at Bougainville and the Declaration of Greater East Asia. In short, their imagination is that as long as they have power, they can suppress victory with power. Therefore, we must win this war no matter what. The brave fighting on the front lines has achieved great victories, and the people in the rear must also unite and do their best in their duties to advance together. This is truly necessary.</p>
<p>Ambassador Kurusu was temporarily silent. We asked what Hull's attitude was when he handed over the memorandum. Then he continued his speech.</p>
<p>After we were placed under house arrest, in January, we saw an article written by the Washington branch chief of the New York Times, Crocker, who is a journalist well-versed in Hull's inner workings, saying - "Actually, Hull did not want to hand over that kind of memorandum. Hull's intention was to postpone the Japanese-American negotiations a little longer in order to complete war preparations at this time." Perhaps this is the truth. The United States wanted to defeat Germany and then deal with Japan, so this kind of consideration was inevitable. This is what I often say to Americans. The Washington Conference was the same. What this conference desired was the stability of East Asia, but in practice, it often gave the impression of forcing Japan to submit.</p>
<p>The guidance method for China is also like this. As long as they rely on the United States, they can do it. Britain and the United States themselves carried out the bombing of Nanjing in 1927, but after the Washington Conference, the general anti-foreign movement in China was launched only against Japan. The most interesting thing is that on my way to America, Seya, a high-ranking foreign affairs official in Manila at the time, published an argument, saying that American foreign affairs officials who were well-versed in Eastern affairs completely agreed with his views -</p>
<p>"When I went to Washington, on November 17th, when I went to meet with Roosevelt together with Ambassador Nomura, Hull, who was in the same seat, said that the Japanese government had no credibility. I said that Japan basically did not believe in the United States either. During the previous European war, Japan tried its best to assist the United States. Unexpectedly, at the Paris Conference, the United States launched a large-scale attack on Japan because of the Shandong issue. If you say that there is no credibility, then what will the United States do after this negotiation is successful? Will you deal with Japan after defeating Germany? Is there any guarantee? I said a lot of things like that. Hull was speechless when he heard this."</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Argument</p>
<p>Roosevelt then said that he would be willing to act as a mediator for the Chinese-Japanese problem, but in the end, Hull and some people in the State Department strongly opposed it, and this matter turned into a pie in the sky. The day after receiving Hull's memorandum, I went with Ambassador Nomura to meet with Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt attached to Hull's memorandum that the Japanese military was expanding to the south, right? I said that Japanese public opinion was quite strong, so the US position should be explained at this time. In short, no matter what country, in order to ensure security, even if it is an inch of land, it must advance and prepare for defense. Doesn't Britain constantly strengthen its defenses for Singapore? What is the intention of the United States occupying the former Dutch territory of Guyana in Brazil on November 24th? Although it is said that Japanese public opinion is hardening, when I arrived in the United States, the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee advocated throwing Kurusu into the middle of the Atlantic and crushing Japan. These kinds of rumors are the strong attitude of American public opinion, aren't they also quite impressive? Before the war, on November 3rd, the report of US Ambassador to Japan Grew reached the United States. The US government immediately convened a meeting to decide to hold open-air speeches by government authorities in order to raise awareness of war preparations. Later, the so-called "War and Peace" in the US government's White Paper, which slandered the United States of Japan, asked - "What exactly do you want?" Besides, we don't want to say anything else.

<h3>Cotton Control Association Decides to Purchase Cotton at a Fixed Price; Cotton Merchant Registration Begins Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Report) The Cotton and Cloth Control Committee of the Business Control Association, in order to implement the purchase of cotton at a fixed price, is based on Article 4 of the Outline for the Implementation of Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton: "All members of cotton industry associations in various places affiliated with the Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry Joint Association must register with the Cotton Control Association before they can purchase cotton." Article 5: "Cotton merchants applying for registration should submit their applications to their respective industry associations, which will forward them to the Cotton Industry Joint Association for review and then to the Cotton Control Association for approval and issuance of registration certificates." According to these regulations, the Cotton Control Association began registering cotton merchants yesterday, and notified all cotton merchants (i.e., members of the Sino-Japanese Cotton Industry Joint Association) that they should submit registration applications to their local industry associations, which will forward them to the Cotton Industry Joint Association for review and then to the Cotton Control Association for approval and issuance of registration certificates. Cotton merchants who have not registered are strictly prohibited from purchasing cotton. It is also learned that the Cotton Control Association has discussed and decided on the purchase price of cotton and has submitted it to the Materials Control Review Committee for review and approval, and is now submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval and publication.</p>
<h3>First Police Precinct Vigorously Plans to Improve North Station Order; New Police to be Responsible for Maintaining Traffic</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The First Police Precinct of the city pays close attention to the traffic order problem at the North Station and is vigorously planning to improve it. The precinct has now decided to reform the police officers responsible for maintaining traffic at the North Station. It has been secretly reported that some of the original police officers are undesirable elements who deliberately make things difficult for people in order to extort money. Therefore, it has been decided to adjust the personnel and replace the original police officers with new police officers who have graduated from the police training school, effective from the 20th of this month. These new police officers are all promising young people who have received rigorous training, with in-depth coaching in traffic control. Therefore, they are expected to achieve good results in maintaining traffic. At the same time, the precinct will continue to send personnel to conduct secret investigations. If any cases of extortion are discovered, severe penalties will be imposed. Citizens are also encouraged to cooperate and report any such cases at any time in order to achieve a good improvement in the traffic at the North Station.</p>
<p>Regarding traffic matters in this city, a senior official in charge of traffic affairs for the police authorities made the following four points:</p>
<p>Unified Vehicle License Plates Next Year</p>
<p>Regarding the unification of vehicle license plates, the licenses for various vehicles in this city were inconsistent between the former British and French concessions and the city area. Since the annexation of the concessions, the relevant authorities have been actively working to unify them. After detailed research and with unanimous agreement from all parties, starting next year, the format of vehicle license plates in the city will be completely unified.</p>
<p>Improvement of Traffic Order at North Station</p>
<p>The improvement of traffic order at North Station has long been a concern of all sectors. The reason for the poor order at North Station is that the supply of passenger capacity and vehicles cannot meet the demand, making improvement extremely difficult. Currently, the focus is on making passenger inspections faster and more efficient, providing convenience within the principle of not violating security requirements, and cracking down on a small number of unscrupulous elements and parasitic hooligans who harass legitimate passengers. In this way, the order at the North Station can be gradually improved.</p>
<p>Only Use Human-Powered Vehicles</p>
<p>Currently, the traffic problem in the city is becoming increasingly serious due to the lack of transportation facilities. However, the use of human-powered vehicles is gradually increasing due to demand and can be utilized. Regarding motor vehicles, it is hoped that their use will be minimized under the goal of conserving materials. Regarding the issuance of vehicle licenses, due to the lack of transportation, the authorities have recently been making efforts to give licenses to those using human-powered vehicles. In addition to expecting citizens to refuse illegal demands, they should also report the facts to the relevant departments at any time in order to thoroughly investigate.</p>

<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3>Fuel Problems</h3>
<p>Knowing what price coal briquettes are being sold for on the black market in Shanghai recently, what price firewood is being sold for per hundred catties, and to what extent the use of electricity and gas has been reduced, one can know how serious the fuel problem in this city has become!</p>
<p>During the last year or two of the previous European War, the major belligerent countries all felt the seriousness of the fuel problem, which was no less than the food problem, or even exceeded it, because "even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice" is certainly true, but "even the cleverest cook cannot cook without firewood" is even more true. No wonder people popularly call labor compensation "salary" and not "rice water" or "powder water," the meaning of which may lie here.</p>
<p>The reasons for the fuel problem are generally reduced production in the place of origin and disruptions in transportation between the place of origin and the place of sale. It is said that the reason for the reduced coal production in North China is the reduction in the number of miners, and the reason for the reduction in the number of miners is the food problem. Therefore, the positive method is to work hard to increase the production of miners and to dredge transportation, while the negative method is for all citizens to save fuel consumption and use fuel substitutes as early as possible, such as paper, scrap wood, etc., to replace coal briquettes. In addition, residents should save electricity, go to bed early, and get up early, which is also a broad sense of saving fuel, reducing coal consumption to a minimum, in order to maintain the daily supply of fuel to the people.</p>
<h3>Concrete Measures Agreed Upon for Raw Material Problems in Various Factories; Flour Mills and Others Adjust Production</h3>
<p>Large and small factories in this city are indeed a part of maintaining Shanghai's economy, but in recent months, due to the shortage of raw materials, most of them are in a state of reduced scope or suspension of business. This situation has an impact on the prosperity of this city, so the relevant authorities have already agreed on concrete measures. According to reporter's investigation, the raw material problems of various small factories have been partially resolved. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Flour and Other Factories Have Received Allocations</p>
<p>The flour mills will purchase 1 million bags of wheat, which will be allocated by the Wheat Flour Unified Allocation Office to the flour mills for producing flour for people's food.</p>
<p>Oil Mills Produce 100 Loads Per Day</p>
<p>At the same time, the Oil and Grain Committee has allocated the oil and grain raw materials purchased from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to various oil mills in small quantities. Currently, the average daily output is about 100 loads.</p>
<p>Coal Yards are Allocated 20,000 Tons</p>
<p>Currently, the amount of coal transported from North China is very scarce. The authorities are currently allocating 20,000 tons of coal recently arrived in Shanghai to various coal yards according to the degree of need, for the production of coal briquettes and fuel.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association Strictly Prohibits Private Transactions</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Coal Market, No. 05, had previously been stipulated by the industry association to temporarily prohibit the purchase and sale of spot and futures goods. However, the market remains open as usual, and for several months, it has been relatively stable, and various transactions have been virtually suspended. However, recently, due to the stagnant source of coal, holders have taken the opportunity to hoard and speculate to obtain illicit profits, resulting in private transactions in the market, which are illegal. Now the industry association has decided to strictly prohibit them, not allowing anyone to participate. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished in order to stabilize the market.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Suzhou Agricultural Lending Office</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications, as a bank for developing the national industry, has listed agricultural lending as a major business. Based on the results of the investigation, it is now preparing to establish an Industrial Economic Office in Suzhou, which will begin operations immediately.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Re-Limits Stock Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The stock price fluctuation limits for listed stocks on the Chinese Securities Exchange have been re-adjusted. The regulations are as follows: Stocks below 10 yuan: fluctuation of 1 jiao (0.1 yuan). Stocks below 50 yuan: fluctuation of 2.5 jiao (0.25 yuan). Stocks above 50 yuan but below 100 yuan: fluctuation of 5 jiao (0.5 yuan). Stocks above 100 yuan but below 200 yuan: fluctuation of 1 yuan. Stocks above 200 yuan but below 500 yuan: fluctuation of 2.5 yuan. Stocks above 500 yuan but below 1,000 yuan: fluctuation of 5 yuan. Stocks above 1,000 yuan: fluctuation of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Bidding Frenzy, Chinese Stocks Reach New Highs Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bullish sentiment in Chinese stocks increased unabated. Amidst favorable investment rumors, buyers were willing to pay high prices to make purchases. The "New Pharmaceutical Industry," which had risen the most in this round of gains, also saw a surge in buying. The progress of various "Department Store Industry" stocks was also rapid, especially the Guohuo Company, which had limited supply due to news of increased production. "Textile Industry" stocks, with Xinhuo, Renfeng, Wuhuo, and Meilun performing best, all rose sharply. The gains of Jinglun and Jingfu were unprecedented.

<h3>Minister of Information Hirota Comments on the Anti-Axis Conference; Japan Has Already Replied with a Great Victory</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference for the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Group at the Huamei Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday (9th). From the Embassy side, Minister of Information Hirota, Vice Consul Fukama, etc., attended. Minister Hirota gave a detailed discussion on the factors of failure of the Anti-Axis Conference and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Dreaming Like a Fool</p>
<p>Minister of Information Hirota first stated that the Anti-Axis conference held in Cairo and Tehran in the last ten days of November this year was attended by US President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek of the Chongqing regime. Judging from the statements issued by them, they shamelessly claimed that they would win the East Asia War, attempt to seize Japanese territory, and force Japan to be reduced to a third-rate country. Our Japanese response to their conference was clearly stated in Prime Minister Tojo's passionate speech. Now, we have set the year as the year of decisive battle. Prime Minister Tojo's determination and the large-scale offensives launched by Japan have been clearly answered in the naval and air battles in the South Pacific, such as the naval and air battles on Bougainville Island, the Marshall Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. Japan has achieved great victories, which is sufficient to answer the Cairo Conference of the Anti-Axis powers. Furthermore, regarding the Anti-Axis powers' plan to recapture Burma, we have also responded. On the 7th of this month, Japan's large-scale offensive, centered on Calcutta in India and Changde in Hunan Province, has also achieved a great victory. This has answered the Anti-Axis powers' attempt to recapture Burma. Therefore, we do not care about the rumors of the Cairo Conference, because the proof we have given is the concrete victory.</p>
<p>Seeing Through Their Conspiracy</p>
<p>As for the content of the Tehran Conference, there is also no concrete content. They stated in the statement they issued that they would discuss all opinions before defeating Germany, but the release of this content was the same as the content of the meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in the last ten days of October, as well as the Quebec Conference, Washington Conference, and Casablanca Conference. Especially before the Tehran Conference, we had already seen through their conspiracy, so Germany has never succumbed and has exerted a strong fighting force. At the same time, our purpose for this meeting is to make Turkey participate in the war and use Turkish territory to attack the Balkans. Therefore, observing their operations, such as the past operations against Italy, the Badoglio regime unconditionally surrendered on September 8th. It has been three months since then, and within this period, the area developed by the Anti-Axis powers is only about 100 kilometers, so there is no special progress. Therefore, we can be sure that they dare not attack and dare not fight in the Balkans. In short, there is nothing special to pay attention to in the Tehran Conference. Their convocation of this conference is no different from a rabbit gathering when the lion is fighting, and it is difficult to be effective.</p>

<h3>Introducing a Student Cafeteria - Saving Money and Time</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Road YMCA student cafeteria is located in a very quiet corner upstairs. Inside, there are more than twenty snow-white tables and about a hundred stools, chairs, and clean chopsticks and plates. As for the dining procedure, it is also very simple. Just pay the meal fee at the counter and you can pick up your food yourself. Although it costs 9.5 cents, I got three bowls of rice, a dish of vegetables, and a bowl of soup for being late.</p>
<p>I think the student cafeteria, in addition to providing us with economical, clean and nutritious meals, also allows us to eat as soon as we arrive, without having to wait. In the past, when I ate in ordinary restaurants, I had to wait at least a quarter of an hour or two, and sometimes the food didn't come. Calculating carefully, if I waste a quarter of an hour each time, I will waste half an hour for two meals a day, and I will waste 182 and a half hours a year invisibly. Based on reading thirty hundred words per hour, if you eat in the student cafeteria every day, you can read forty or fifty more useful books in a year. This is a statistical figure from many people! (Mingzhi)</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Seal Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched the Christmas anti-tuberculosis seal sale campaign. Teachers and students from various schools in the city participated enthusiastically. Each "anti-tuberculosis seal" has one hundred stamps, which can be affixed to New Year cards and envelopes. The selling price is twenty yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, and can be purchased from the association at 25 Chizhe Road, Aiqinwenyi Road. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Lung Hospital.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather Clothing Donation Report (December 9th)</h3>
<p>Feng Shizhong, Cheng Zuosheng, 1,000 yuan each, Zhou Ji 200 yuan, Lin Haoxiu 100 yuan, a student from Yucai (left behind) 5 yuan, finder (picked this up) 1 yuan, totaling 2,306 yuan. Adding the previous balance, the total is 78,396 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>The 4th of this month was the 60th birthday of Madam, the mother of Mr. Chu Longyin Longjie Neng. Mr. Chu and others followed her instructions to save 5,000 yuan from the birthday celebration and donate it to the children's library, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a donation of porridge coupons from Manager Ding Yuntai of Shanggu Shufang for the Chinese Education Morality Association. We would like to thank the victims on their behalf.</p>
<p>The Tanzuo Chinese Confucius Society will invite Mr. Feng Mingquan to continue lecturing on the "Analects" and Mr. Sun Xiangzhong to continue lecturing on the "Doctrine of the Mean" at 2 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Makoto grew up very vigorously.</p>
<p>Most children don't need to worry and grow up smoothly, but there are none as easy to care for as Makoto. His fourth brother is very gentle, but he often suffers from dysentery, which makes people worry. Although Makoto is not particularly fat, strangely, he has no worms, nor has he ever vomited. When he wants to suckle, he cries loudly, and when he is full, he sleeps quietly. When he is awake, he plays with his own hands alone. In just three months, he started to smile.</p>
<p>He is a child who likes to laugh. White skin, slender eyes, and a mole under the corner of his eye. It is indeed his mother's inheritance. His bright red lips are lightly closed, like his father's. Anyone who sees him will smile. He is a lovely baby. And even when he sees a stranger, he laughs happily, so people often mistake him for a girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, such a cute child will give you a good daughter-in-law in the future."</p>
<p>Chang Manzi carried Makoto and played on the road. Women passing by would also tease Makoto like this.</p>
<p>On his third birthday, his mother held Makoto and visited the Hachiman Shrine in the village. This year, Wakako gave birth to her twelfth child, Masahiko. She became busier every day, but she never missed the fifteenth visit. She changed into a kimono with a family crest and walked through the stone archway of the base six. She carefully washed her hands, rinsed her mouth, and went to the front of the hall to pray for a long time. She didn't ask the gods for anything, she just prayed sincerely. Especially when she gave birth to a boy, she prayed like this for a long time every time.</p>
<p>Arata Hachimangu Shrine is a very historic shrine. The current hall was built by Shimazu the fifteenth lord, Takaehisa, and the origin of its worship is also very long. The temple fair on September 23rd has a sea parade ceremony, which is indeed one of the grand events of Sakuraejima, but it has now been abandoned. However, the custom that the white sand under the hall can ward off poisonous snakes is still circulating. Ancient books record, "This shrine strictly prohibits snakes, so there are no such insects in Arata Village." In fact, there are indeed very few snakes in the vicinity. The villagers' belief in this local temple is quite strong. Makoto later became a navy officer, and he never forgot to come and worship whenever he returned to his hometown.</p>
<p>Makoto also wore a cotton kimono with a family crest to visit on his fifth birthday. Three months after Masahiko was born, he died young, but in that year, her eighth son, Sueo, was born. Perhaps the name Sueo had an effect, and Wakako's long-term childbearing life came to an end. When Makoto was seven years old, the world had undergone great changes, and the unprecedented Great Kanto Earthquake occurred. Tokyo began to have radios. And not long ago, the battleships Mutsu and Nagato appeared simultaneously on the Japanese Sea.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Gentleman on the Beam"</h3>
<p>After watching the second play "The Gentleman on the Beam" by the Kugantroupe, a long-term charity performance for the scholarship of our newspaper's contributors, in the secluded pool seat of the Paris Grand Theatre, I felt suffocated.</p>
<p>This play does not have a tortuous plot, but it has a perfect and ingenious ending, just like an exquisite tangram, pieced together with various different shapes. The pivot of the whole play is the word "fate." Bao San's gentleman on the beam, from the very beginning, not everyone knows that he is a generation who lives a precarious life; and the lawyer's collusion with Bao San, to gain fame and deceive the world; Bai's secretary and Ai Lan's secret affair, stealing jade and stealing fragrance; the constable of the district and Xia Datata's secret appointment, and even Ma Luxi's vegetarian diet, holding a position without doing anything, all conform to the word "fate," thus portraying a wrong, wrong, and laughable picture of life. The author of "The Gentleman on the Beam" is ruthless. With ingenious techniques, he made a spicy satire on our society of open and secret theft. In addition to understanding the humor, the audience must not be deceived by him.</p>
<p>The success of the Kugantroupe's performance is probably undeniable. Among the several famous directors in the drama world, Mr. Qian Renzhi is famous for his subtlety, while what Mr. Zuo Lin pursues is obviously eye-catching and clear. The vividness of the colors and the fluency of the rhythm are infinitely pleasant.</p>
<p>The actors' contributions are even more remarkable. The women, such as Lin Bin, Lin Zhen (how charming she is, yet how sweet!), Danny, and the men, such as Bai Cheng, Shi Yuan, Wang Jun, Qi Luo, and Shi Hui, truly give people the feeling of "meeting a worthy opponent, meeting a good general." Qi Luo's performance in "Gone with the Wind" is obviously a step further. Although compared to the previous one, it is slightly less eye-catching, but Wang Jun's acting skills here seem to be more inclined towards the style of Tourneur.</p>
