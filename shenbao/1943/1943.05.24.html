<h3 id="c1">決戰階段卽將開始 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>世界戰局的急劇轉變的時期，快要來臨，任何方面，都在準備着決戰階段的開始。</p>
<p>突尼斯和比塞大戰事的結束，是世界戰爭的轉捩點，所謂眞正的戰爭，可能在任何一個最近的明天爆發，這是毫無疑問的了。問題是在於今後的戰爭重心，和它可能發展的趨勢，這正是反軸心國今日發生矛盾的焦點，所謂「戰略之爭執」，就在這裏發生，而其結果，無疑的是給軸心國以莫大的利益。俗諺云：「叫貓不會捕鼠」，決戰前夕羅邱之叫囂和軸心國常局的沉靜，多少可以暗示出未來的前途吧！</p>
<p>從整個戰局來看，當北非戰爭給束之後，據反軸心軍的軍事觀察家的判斷，它們的勝利，是建築在立即向歐洲進攻上面的，因爲不然的話，主動就要操在軸心國之手，不僅倫數，而且紐約，都可能遭遇到突然的攻襲。然而反軸心國家却在這時發生了新的衝突，英國以邱吉爾爲首的統治者，依「本國利益第一」的觀點，堅持所謂「首先打倒希特勒」的自私的戰略方針，他勸誘美國出動最大的兵力到歐洲去，還希圖史太林上他的圈套，在東方替他們從火中取栗，以安羅斯福的心。可是道種戰略，顯然已在美國陸海軍方面引起了絕大的反感，曾經被目爲羅斯福之忠實腹心的美參議員陳德勤最近在國會的演說，充分暴露了美國統治者深刻不安的心理，挃擊邱吉爾的歐洲中心戰略，他向繼斯福警吿：「當英國和蘇聯逐鹿歐洲的時候，美國總統將痛感自己業已喪失對世界的發言權。」因此這種反對「歐洲重心戰略」的運動，已經在美國汎濫了。我們有充分的可能指出，常華府議論未決的時候，世界戰局的新出發點，已在某一地點而若干地點開始了，因軸心國早已不用在戰略方面有什麽折衝，大家利害一致的，這是決戰階段開始前的第一個特徵。</p>
<p>未來決戰將在何處演出，固然無人可加論斷，然而，如我們日前所指出的，地中海戰塲，將首先集中雙方的火力。現在義大利已經宣布全國進入戰時狀態，全國國民都已處身在前綫，緊張起一致力量，以對抗敵人可能的登陸作戰，而驚人的空戰，已經開始了好幾天。從目前形勢來觀察，由於西西里和撒丁尼亞兩島防衛力的鞏固，由於南部義大利德義聯防力量遂日加强，地中海中部的控制權，屹然掌握在軸心國之手。也依靠着這一點，使敵人向土耳其和西班牙進行的陰謀無法發生作用，也使軸心國有充分的時閒，在法國南部，西部，在荷比各國，在斯坎的那半島進行數千里防綫的强化工作，同時也能在巴爾榦半島進行肅淸敵方活動和加强動員工作。相反的，反軸心軍經過北非的巨大消耗之後，要從非洲廣大的地域，西與英倫及東與近東方面集結起攻勢的力量，那是一件最不容易的事情，何况內部還存在着舊的與新的矛盾。</p>
<p>德蘇戰綫有三個月的靜寂，這是雙方拚命進行準備的時間，現在依據雙方所宣布的若干消息，可以說，彼此都承認，對方的準備都已相當完成，決定性的戰爭，已經到了隨時可以爆發的時期，儘管歐洲的局面由於非洲之戰局和去年今日完全不同，但是德蘇戰局在世界戰局中的決定性的地位，却不僅一點沒有減少，反而是更增加了。軸心軍在突尼斯和比塞大，以十餘師的小兵力，抵抗着較諸東綫蘇軍數量不少而且質量也許更優的敵軍，支持了三個多月，可是在東綫，軸心軍並不否認他集中了十倍於北非的兵力，三個月來埋頭準備，未輕動用，軸心軍之絕不否認其主要攻擊對象，是顯而易見的了。因此，我們與其重視華府方面羅邱的爭執，邱吉爾對史大林的幻想，以及羅斯福一派「反攻日本」的夢囈，還不如注意德蘇戰爭之發展更有意義，我們所謂任何一個最近的明天，行將爆發的決戰，也在於此。</p>
<p>決戰階段未臨之前，爲着掩飾自己的眞正企圖，爲着防範英蘇的拔扈，羅期福的一派在太平洋方面製造出若干事件，如對阿留申羣島日軍佔領達一年的阿圖島之冒險登陸，便是最顯明的一例。敵方的宣傳機關，不惜從這此事件中大事鼓吹。但其作用，僅僅暫時欺騙重慶和澳洲也不會成功，事實已使重慶和澳洲對所謂「盟國」由失望而怨恨了。就是英國方面，也絕不相信美國這種把戲，所以，邱吉爾在其對美國會的演說，指出：「美國最大部分兵力在太平洋」，這在美國人面前，是何等幽默的諷剌，因爲，「美國最大部份兵力」所表現的乃是最大的慘敗。</p>

<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美揷足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此閃大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任艱鉅，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧怍。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，摘爲新抄，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尙祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>

<p>日本堵塞旅順口一事，前已屢得電信譯列報端，茲閱日本東京某日報云：東歷二月二十三日（即華歷正月初八日）至二十四日日海軍司令長官東鄉氏，督同艦隊奮力往攻，成效如何，未經報到，然東鄉氏素日膽大心細，此時諒能奏凱而還也。至堵塞旅順之石船，一爲郵船會社之仁川丸，重二千三百三十一噸，船身鐵質，製自西暦一千八百七十七年。一爲兵庫縣人川村佐吉之報國丸，重二千七百六十六噸，船身係鐵質，製自西暦一千八百七十年。一爲商船會社之武陽丸，重五百六十三噸，船身係鋼鐵二質，製自西曆一千八百八十九年。一爲商船會社之武州丸，重一千二百八十九噸，船身係鋼質，製自西曆一千八百八十三年。又聞俄督矮立幾息夫所傳公電云：西暦二月二十四日，（即華暦正月初九日）午前二下鐘越四十五分時，斜月已沉，曉星未起，日人以水雷艇再攻旅順，另用輪船四號，滿載引火之物，擬即鑿沉以堵港口。俄立禿烏伊仁砲臺發砲轟擊，中有二船毀於港口附近，旣而燭以電光遠鐃，遙見四船破瓖，有水雷艇八號駛入日本艦隊，鼓浪而歸，目下港口依舊通行，全無障礙。</p>

<p>日本大阪某日報登駐滬俄總領事所得官報，大略謂西曆二月二十二號（即華曆正月初七日）及二十三號（即初八日）夜半，忽有軍艦來襲旅順，被我擊退，昏黑中未悉其爲何國之船，亦不知爲何等船質，見破壞船舶六艘而已。已由俄國派駐旅順武官電吿曰：西曆二月二十四日（即華曆正月初九日）午前二下鐘時，有日本水雷艇橫駛至旅順口，攻擊砲臺，另用輪船八艘，滿載石塊，意圖堵塞港門，俄帥見之急令立禿烏衣亨艦會合砲臺發砲轟擊，日艇望立禿烏衣亨艦飛駛而進，旋有輪船二艘，一瓖於淺瀨，一在黃金山燈樓附近擊沉。斯時夜色甚明，未幾又見輪船四艘次第沉沒，水雷艇八號，遂退歸艦隊。所沉各輪船中，水手人等一半溺死，一半不知所之。至於日艦隊中有無損傷，岸上望之不甚明晰，祗見其分爲二隊，向地平綫而行。其西暦二月九號（即華暦去年十二月二十四日）所傷諸艦，則迅速修繕，不久又可從事於海天漭瀁中矣。</p>

<p>日本東京某日報云：旅順之戰，頃由海軍統領東鄉氏電告情形，大略謂：我日各軍艦，豫期聯約，定於東歷三月十日，將旅順港口圍攻。九日之夜，報時鐘逾十有一下，先令逐水雷艦隊，赴旅順口外偵察一周，迨十日天明，分爲甲乙二隊，甲隊用特製之機器，將水雷沉諸港外，俄國砲臺守將瞭見，立即發砲遙轟，我各艦毫無損傷，得將水雷沉畢而返。至四下鐘越三十分頃，甲隊六艦，直抵老鐵山之南，與敵之逐水雷艦偪近，　戰三十分許，我「朝潮」「霞」「曉」三艦，殆與敵艦之舷相摩，敵艦三四艘，砲火齋施，非常猛烈。旣而敵艦疊受砲彈，或損壞機器，或艙中火焚，惟聞軍士哀號，不知傷害幾許。泊敵艦敗北而遁，而我「朝潮」「霞」「曉」三艦，亦已飽經敵彈，損害非輕，艦中共斃士卒七名。「霞」傷總司機人南澤安雄，及士卒七名。「曉」汽鍋炸烈，熱水噴薄，立斃士卒四名，蓋至此而三艦皆已不能行駛矣。乙隊於淸晨七下鐘時，將抵口外，纂於海洋中見敵之逐水雷艦二艘，乃直前阻其歸途，發砲攻擊，的戰一分時許，兩軍皆損害甚多。未幾敵艦一艘，如飛遁去。其一名司鐵立唔司氣者，駛抵要塞之下，被我砲彈所傷，隨由漣艦據獲，以巨　曳之而歸。時則海中浪駭濤驚，水從彈穴中汨汨而入，不得已將絙割斷，拘回敵兵四名。至十下鐘越十五分時，敵艦漸漸沉沒，事後查得漣曙二艦，陣亡士卒二名，傷少尉島祐吉及士卒三名，先是敵艦諾烏怡之苦，及拔陽飛駛出口，向我軍乙隊在追，後見我巡洋艦隊與之偪近，遂仍轉舵而返。我海軍正隊及巡洋艦隊，於是日淸晨八下鐘時，同扺旅順海面，爲逐水雷艦隊後援，未幾我正隊諸艦改向老鐵山進發，巡洋艦隊則直抵港門，自午前十下鐘至午後一下鐘越四十分時，正隊發砲向岸上越擊，彈中敵之要隘，敵亦發砲以應，我諸艦一無所傷。另有巡洋艦一隊，至大連灣外三山島，將敵人所建倉庫營壘遙轟，高砂千早二艦，則在旅順半島西岸偵察敵情，見前次擊破之敵艦烏奴希鐵利奴伊沉在鳩灣水淺處，水上微露桅及烟通。</p>

<p>南京二十三日中央社電　渝方各界對於現在華盛頓舉行中之羅邱會談，咸極關心。蔣介石曾迭次召孔祥熙·何應欽·熊式輝等最高幹部舉行會議，根據宋子文·魏道明之報吿，協議應付方策·茲綜合各種消息，可知渝方對於華盛頓會談，依然堅持歐洲作戰第一主義之議論，頗爲不滿。並指出日本刻正利用緬甸泰國越南馬來爲培養戰力之基地，故日本之戰略地位，日形鞏固，以喚起英美注意。目主張歐亞並重主義，其要點爲（一）增强配置，以開通國外路綫爲目的之兵力，尤應積極準備反攻緬甸作戰。（二）增設由美國太平洋沿岸至緬印國境間之空軍基地，及補給連絡機關。（三）積極以飛機軍需資村運往重慶等。但羅邱會議之經過，依然傾向於歐洲重點主義，對於重慶之立塲，僅稍加考慮。渝大公報二十日亦曾對此種情形，表示悲觀云</p>

<p>莫斯科二十三日中央社電　國際共產黨執行委員會，二十二日以世界現勢嚴重爲理由，提出解散國際共產組織方案。該提案係由國際共產黨書記長及各國共黨代表署名，惟英·美代表並未列名。據該委員昨聲明解散理由謂，自一九一九年國際共黨組織成立以來，國際情勢即激變不已，尤以此次大戰發生後，事變更趨嚴重，故上項勞動階級前衛之國際組織早已不適合國際情勢。國際共黨組織實有解散之必要，惟今後各國共黨應盡力支援作戰。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　此間端典日報二十一日載台維斯談話，據稱：余今日上午九時訪晤斯達林，面交羅斯福總統親筆函，至十一時半始辭出，該函內容未能奉吿，至以爲歉，但可能奉吿諸君者，即該函文字極長。斯達林於接受後，即交人以蘇語譯讀，渠則傾耳靜聽。又渠曾謂擬於日內再與余會晤。</p>
<p>羅斯福之要求內容</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　海通社引里斯本美國之與華盛頓參議員有密切接觸者稱：莫斯科昨日所宣吿之解散第三國際，實係出於羅斯福總統所倡議。該美國方面確信：羅斯福總統在交與其專使台維斯轉致斯達林之函中，曾提出關於此事之具體要求，羅斯福之要求，大致如下：（一）羅期福總統極力要求斯達林對於政治上之策略應較以往更爲審愼，蓋因莫斯科將其政治及軍事之目標宣布過早，以致消除芬蘭與蘇聯對敵之計劃未能成功。（二）羅斯福總統要求斯達林特別審愼宣布蘇聯對於其西鄰各國之戰爭目標，尤其是關於波蘭·巴爾幹及土耳其等國。蓋蘇聯之兼併計劃宣示過早，將使此等國家增强其抵抗之決心。（三）羅斯福總統要求斯達林有效協助消除英·美國內之緊張，爲達此項目的，渠提議立即或至少在形式上解散國際共產主義機關，並結束共黨國際。（四）爲酬報斯達林之實踐上述要求，羅斯福總統宣布準備在締結和平時，聽由斯達林對於有關蘇聯利益之歐洲方面絕對任意處置。</p>
<p>建議召集四頭會議</p>
<p>里期本二十三日中央社電　海通社駐此間特派員昨晚談稱：羅斯福總統致斯達林之長函，台維斯專使事前曾閱讀其內容，美方之所以散播台維期不悉內容之宣傳者，係因羅斯福深恐函內重要部份如洩漏過早，將礙及台維斯使命之成功。此事在此間美國僑民中，已成公開之秘密，彼等係因與華盛頓若干參議員有關而知之，但其姓名至今未查明。此項情報之準確性，雖米必盡屬可靠，但關於該函內容消息之來源，及同時洩露之若干其他事實，均可保證上項情報之正確。該函曾提及世界軍略問題。又曾着重於集中更强大軍力以備進攻之需要。</p>
<p>德外交界發表見解</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德外交部二十二日特就蘇聯解散國際共黨事發表見解，大意謂：蘇聯解散國際共黨，顯係故弄虛玄，斯達林已藉此舉而能與反軸心國爲伍。奠定雜斯福，邱吉爾，斯達林會議之基礎，然此舉對美方之反猶太及反共產主義者，則實爲一莫大打擊。斯達林解散第三國際，但同時已建立第四國際。斯達林前曾宣稱，其將劃波蘭·立陶宛·愛沙尼亞·拉脫維亞·芬蘭·挪威·瑞典等東南歐諸國歸其勢力圈之內，今日此舉更堅固此種政策之野心即將在此等國家內分別樹立形式不同之蘇維埃政府。總之，斯達林敢採取此種措置，實係羅斯福使然，蓋羅斯福惟藉此始可維持其親近斯達林政策，並使蘇聯可自由向歐洲發展，然歐洲諸國頃正爲保全歐洲防禦共產主養而戰，其必不能因斯達林此舉而受絲毫上影響，決始終繼續與共產主義挑戰，直至其絕滅而後已。</p>

<p>— 佐藤喜一郎　譯自改造五月號</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，姑置勿論，這次歐洲大戰，指示了無論怎樣强有力的艦隊，倘若沒有空軍協力，是絕對不能達到任務的。艦隊在海上的任務，不必說，是擊滅海上或基地的敵方艦隊，攻擊敵方沿海各種設施，破壞聯絡運輸綫及通商綫，並防護我海上運輸通信聯絡，掩護陸上軍隊等。而艦隊作戰的這些成果，可以說，是爲第一制空權如何，第二作戰中或空海區域上的艦隊行動的自由如何所左右的。不過這第一和第二兩個條件，在本質上決不是可以分開的，沒有第一個條件，第二個條件大半就不能成立。換句話說：制空權是制海權的前驅，所謂『由空中而來之制海權』，就是示明這種關係的。</p>
<p>由空中而來之制海權——換言之，空軍對於海軍的勝利的最好的例子，可以看德軍的挪成作戰。德軍的挪威作戰，在英國之先，立即佔領航空基地，由軍艦和運輸機使軍隊登陸。英國艦隊急遽護衛運輸船團聞往挪威，但因沒有顧慮到航空兵力的跟隨，所以在離海岸一百至二百公里的海上，遭受的一百五十架的德轟炸機隊的邀擊，隨有戰艦及巡洋艦的運輸船團，很簡單地被消滅了。這是含有在陸上獲得了航空基地的德國空軍，在海上二百公里的制空圈內，捕捉或擊滅了敵方艦船的意義的，不外是在制空權的面前，制海權及其他什麼，那歸於烟消雲散的實據。</p>
<p>常德軍實行挪威作戰時，最煞費苦心的，是向散佈於蜿蜓一千公里的狹長的地城上的港灣，同時將軍隊登陸的困難。這種作戰，是沒有前例的。於是，先將漢勃爾格，維爾漢姆斯哈芬，克爾，旭台涇，坦基希，梅爾高丁哈芬等運出軍隊的港灣，以戰鬥機和高射砲嚴密防守。其次在運輸軍隊時，以從前未曾出征過的德國空軍秘藏的雙發複機，每小時速度六百公里的梅塞旭彌特——。加以護衛；同時出動轟炸機往北海方面，盡全力擊沉英艦艇的哨船。而且，於四月三日八日十日這三日間，將六十架飛機編爲七隊，反覆轟炸英國本土的斯加巴甫洛軍港，英國空軍在畫間完全不能從飛機塲飛起來，夜間方可行動，所以能夠探知德軍的動靜的，只是德艦隊向海上活動的漢然的情報。</p>
<p>這樣，四月九日黎明，德戰艦雪魯霍斯特號，巡洋艦希沛爾號以下驅逐艦隊，運輪軍隊向挪威海岸登陸，作戰開始後，只有三日問，向諾爾成克，托倫哈姆，培爾開，斯太彭凱，克里斯瓊桑，阿林達爾，渥斯洛等海港的登陸，成功了。繼而由運輸機實行空運，使之奪取敵人防綫背後的飛機塲。舉示渥斯洛的一個例，由五架戰鬥機掩護的運輸機，九日降落在附近的民用飛機塲，從運輸機裏跳出一百二十名兵土，於十五分鐘內，攻陷飛機塲，使後繼的運輸機安全迅速地降落，三千兵登陸，不到一小時。此外，如斯太彭凱，是由降落傘部隊所佔據的。</p>
<p>一方面，英國海軍接到德艦隊出港的報告，立即派以戰艦里那烏號爲旗艦，配以九雙水雷艇的北部艦隊，開往由托羅姆瑞到諾爾威克的沿岸，担任數設機雷和陸戰隊登陸；又派以戰艦洛達納號，巡洋艦渥羅拉號以下驅逐艦水雷艇九隻而編成的南部艦隊，開往培爾開，阻止德艦隊的北上。然而德艦隊，不但在數小時前已駛進了諾爾威克港，而且南北兩艦隊遭受德森炸機的猛轟，尤其南部艘隊，戰艦洛達納號全彈命中，巡洋艦渥羅拉號受創更重，驅逐艦格爾加號，在四小時半以內沉沒，兩艦隊狼狽地逃囘基地去了。</p>
<p>對於這次敗退，英國海軍期望捲土重來，從新以福斯巴特號爲旗艦，配置巡洋艦及驱逐艦各數隻，及其他許多小艦艇，編成大艦隊，向諾爾威克進攻。四月十三日，給與德國七隻水雷艇以極大的損害，不久爲出動救援友軍的德轟炸機的大集團所發見，數隻受了致命的重創，向諾爾威克登陸的企圖就成泡影，遂又不得不退知了。</p>
<p>那時，英國空軍也出動攻擊克里斯瓊桑，培爾開，斯太彭凱方面的德艦船飛機塲，但德軍於十二日以戰鬥機加强這些飛機塲，攻擊毫無效果。</p>
<p>其後，至六月九日挪威軍降服爲止，德英兩軍不斷地死鬥着，英艦艇被德轟炸機擊敗好幾次，戰艦福斯巴特號，經巡洋艦加爾號，愛非印喀姆號以下許多水雷艇及掃海艇等，都被擊沉了。</p>
<p>挪威作戰，如最初所說的一样，始終是德國空軍積極作戰的勝利。德軍的戰略，是一開始佔據丹麥，挪威的飛機塲，而使航空根據地接近戰綫，趕快把握制空權，而使友軍艦隊易於登陸作戰；同時，遠在海上設定制空圈，擊破英國艦隊。但英國海軍將航空根據地置於離戰綫很遠的地點，所以一面堂堂大艦隊向前航行，一面常爲德轟炸機襲擊而遭敗退。</p>

<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>假使要振興社會，鞏固國勢，我以爲揚棄潛勢力是最重要的基本工作了。何以言之呢？申述理由如下：</p>
<p>我們先瞧潛勢力的利害得失若何？無才無能之流，依憑了他父親伯叔輩的潛勢力，任職高位，拍馬營鑽之功十足，不數年，已大搖大擺，儼然以大人物自命。考其實學，則僅能交際，出入歌台舞榭，作一名酒囊飯袋而已。有眞才實學者，却反久居人下。而社會賴以支持推進者，則爲後者。前者盤踞不去，後者無以抬頭，此爲揚棄潛勢力理由之一。</p>
<p>我們再看現社會的畸形發展。在位者，利用職權，憑籍了職位上的潛勢力，在外耀武揚威，以逞私慾，因而造成了非常可畏的結果。這次張金海的慘死與某方面利用潛勢力有極大的關聯。此爲揚棄潛勢力理由之二。</p>
<p>我們再看上海物價的高昂，其原因係囤積居奇所致，而其初實爲各界囤積者，利用其潛勢力，大量扒進所致。（　如，銀行人員一度曾利用其職權，大做投機。）所以究其根源，生活指數之日高，潛勢力之存在實爲一大原因。此爲揚　潛勢力理由之三。</p>
<p>我們再看現社會上：金錢爲最高權威者，一切惟錢是命，有錢卽有勢，即有潛勢力。有了錢任何事都可以做，而許多貧窮有實學者，却反遭人白眼，爲人鄙視。這爲什麼呢？就是一般人太看重錢，太看重潛勢力的緣故。所以，如果我們要糾正如此不良現象，驅除這種不良觀念，揚棄潛勢力實爲一刻不能容緩的工作。此爲揚棄潛勢力理由之四。</p>
<p>潛勢五旣如上述之不良，所以我們一定要揚棄它，才能使社會朝氣蓬勃，國勢蒸蒸日上。然而如何去揚棄它呢？這個問題非常複雜，我們先得明瞭潛勢力存在的原因，了解它的癥結所在，而後能澈底揚棄它。所以我們先去找尋潛勢力的根源。其起因可分下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）潛勢力的存在是因爲社會人士不着重人材，而專門培植自己的親戚友人爲一派，結成所謂黨派，而各自培養勢力，傾軋異己者，因此造成所謂潛勢力。</p>
<p>（二）般居高位者，因職權之便，就營私舞弊。借用地位的優越，形成潛勢力，而橫行不法，爲所欲爲。</p>
<p>（三）一般位居人下者，爲保全飯碗，不惜替上司做私事，替上司掩飾，愈使居高位者肆無忌憚，愈養成根深蒂固的潛勢力。</p>
<p>由於上述諸點，我們可以知道潛勢力是人爲的。解鈴還需繫鈴人，所以，要揚棄潛勢力還得大衆放出力量來共同完成了。</p>
<p>我們不要拖拉無才無能的友朋親戚來培植一已的勢力；我們不要濫用職權，去營私舞弊，我們不要怕懼不替上司營私要失掉飯碗，我們要秉公無私地去工作。如此則潛勢力方會銷聲匿跡。社會才能欣欣向榮，政治才能步入正軌，國家才能振興！</p>
<h3 id="c38">豫省災荒應如何救濟 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 袁維禮</p>
<p>本年豫省發生早災，關於災區情形，以前申報曾刊載一文，叙述詳盡。茲據新鄉縣來人談，豫省災荒之嚴重，目前有增無减，而尤甚者，當推武陟，沁陽（懷慶府）兩縣，蓋去歲沁水曾一度泛濫，水退後，週地淤有膠泥（點土）尺許，此種土壞，非有十足雨量不能播種，故該地附近之同胞因食糧已罄，近日乃以穀糠，麩皮，樹皮，草根，花生皮等充飢。惟秋後百革枯萎，是時豫省同胞將如何，實不難想像。故豫省災荒如何救濟，實爲當局及一般善士之所宜急切注意，茲就管見所及，略陳救濟之方法於后：</p>
<p>（一）盡速輸送食糧至災區，當局應指定人員辦理救濟事宜。其程序應先估計災區所需食糧數量，然後盡速設法輸送食糧至災區。尤有要者，即食糧抵達災區後，應如何才能使災民得到眞正之救濟，易言之，即應竭力設法免除藉賑災以飽私囊之事宜。</p>
<p>（二）興辦農民借貸，以便從速鑿井，災區於去歲雖未能播種，以致今年夏秋所收獲，此僅限於大小麥，與早熟之高粱，穀子等。他如晚熟之玉蜀黍·綠豆·蕎麥等，雖於一月後再行播種，亦不算遲。故當局急宜於災區興辦農民借貸，以便幫助人民開鑿水井並購置水車，倘能及早實現，則不獨此次之災荒可濟，且後起之災荒，亦可因此减少甚至不復見矣。</p>
<p>上述僅爲當局之急務。至於海上善士之所應爲者，則爲慷慨解囊，以便與當局以莫大之協力。準此，敝意以爲本埠各大報館，應從速成立代收救　濟豫省旱災捐款之組織，一如代收張氏邱金然。此定爲服務社會之報界所樂爲，而海上善士，亦定能熱心捐助也。（移酬充捐）</p>

<h3 id="c39">振興小工業的必要 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>在所議囤積與物價問題使人焦灼時，消息傳來，上海有若干小工業勃興，這是極有意義的一件事。到目前爲止，可以列入這種工業的，就是人力車·三輪車·藥品及肥皂等。憑此點事實而斷定華中經濟已在開始復興。雖不免看得太容易，然而在此事實之中，應該認識一般的是經濟，特殊的是中國經濟的强靱性或環境適應性。</p>
<p>說得過份一點，近來的華中經濟方途，太統制經濟化了。以參戰下之中國地位而論，應該要統制經濟，不過它的統制精神與方式，太公式化了。至少一般人都感覺有這種印象。統制經濟一定要酌量各個國民經濟的特殊性而加以限制，在先進國家所認爲妥善的方式，而在認識不淸者看來，或許以爲這種方式是來壓制中國經濟的，所以對於中國統制經濟，必須先有盡善的理想，再謀其實現。我們並不說是因爲商統會的進行或難行現狀而產生了這種結果，但是在那邊應該反省的實在不少，這是毋庸置疑的。</p>
<p>以這種事態爲背景而小工業勃興，究竟有何意味呢？這就是中國統制經濟沒有達到全面活動之前而自然發生的動態。現在準備中的中國統制經濟，利用物資暢通而增進生產，以期實現中國經濟的復興，小工業的勃興，不能當它是無計劃的，應該認爲它是欲求直接達此目的的努力表現如果在物資充沛之日，這種努力，或許要被統制經濟所阻碍，可是現實的華中經濟，正使其相反，唯有統制經濟可幫助此種努力而進展。</p>
<p>不但是上海，就是其他各地，假使有生產事業正要勃輿的時候，不論其規模大小，都應予以協力援助的。我們亟盼日方商工會議所及華方商會對於小工業，多加扶助，則其效果必大。我們更盼中日政府當局及商統會就大乘的見地助長小工業振興，傾力予以指導則有厚望焉。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3 id="c40">銀錢業貸款　收購春繭小麥　端節將屆辦理結賬 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊爲復興農村經濟，舉行農業貸款後，業已由中國交通等行，籌組農業貸款銀團，暫以蘇浙皖三省爲限，即將劃分區域積極進行。此外對於各業收購農產品，如春繭小麥米穀豆類等，決予貸款，原則已決定由各行荘酌量辦理。探悉如下：</p>
<p>春繭貸款</p>
<p>凡經營絲廠業及絲繭商人，因收買春繭得向各行莊申請，聞已成交之春繭貸款總約一萬萬元，頃浙路繭行均已開秤，因繭行均已開齊，而春繭產額反較往年减少，以致各繭行均難收足預額，價格因競收關係互相提高。海寗等處鮮繭改良種司馬秤，每担平均價格的三千元，較實業部評定之標準繭價爲高，蘇路各地繭行即日將開秤，蠶汛聞較浙路爲好，至於上海無錫嘉興等絲廠，因春繭已上市，即將準備開工。</p>
<p>小麥貸款</p>
<p>蘇浙皖各地小麥，業已開始登塲，因雨水調勻，各地均吿豐收；頃各行莊對於小麥貸款允予儘量承貸，同時日商各銀行亦允貸款收買，聞關於小麥之收購和配給，歸全國商業統制總會所屬粉麥專業委員會統）辦理。該會係中日各麵粉廠商以及經營粉麥同業台作之機關，即將向蘇浙皖三省小麥產區大量收購，收得之麥配給各廠充製粉之用。至於小麥價格由主管當局根據農業成本及市價評定之。</p>
<p>端節決定休假</p>
<p>六月七日爲端節，各業循例辦理結賬，頃因端節轉瞬將屆，所以各工廠公司行魷均已開始準備，對以前貸出之客賬一律分別淸單催收，同時對各行莊端節到期之款，各自調度頭寸歸還。聞銀錢業各行莊頃已決定於端節休假。</p>

<h3 id="c44">新式廠裏的學徒 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 申土</p>
<p>我是一家資本雄厚，被譽爲新式鐵工廠裏的事徒。廠長，主任，及其他職員先生們都是喝過黑墨水的，有的甚至於連金都簽過，得着什麽博士，碩士的頭銜。所以，這廠的管理方法是新穎的，據說也是科學化，合理化的。在這種科學化，合理化的制度下，我們學徒的待遇，當然有異於一般其他舊式的，腐敗，不科學化的小廠了。</p>
<p>誠然，我們不用淘米洗菜，我們用不到替老關娘抱小囡，我們也用不着替賬房先生倒夜壺；但，除此以外，我們得到些什麽呢？請看吧！</p>
<p>我們的學習期間計三年，膳宿由廠方供給。在此非常時期，能够三餐，一宿無憂，巳算徼倖，當然不應再加吹求了，不過，我們所希望的：（一）我們所享受的與廠方所付出的代價相等，不要中飽了少數人，而使我們加倍受苦。（二）品質方面，雖不能考究，淸潔方面則絕對不能忽略的。但是，當我們發現包飯價格與飯菜不相稱，或是飯菜裏有了蒼蠅，事務先生都是幫廚房脫話，並用記過或開除的手段來威脅我們，在究竟是爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>舊式商店或工廠裏的學徒，按月得領有相當的月規錢，我們同樣的有，大抵在十元至二十元之間，視年代久暫及工作勤惰而定，不過名目不同，特定爲「到工津貼」而已。顧名思義，當然是這津貼上工才拿得到的，若是請假必須按照時日扣除，雖說這十念塊錢，不够資本家的一枝烟，一杯酒，但管理先生竟不會忽略過去，可見其精明一斑了。</p>
<p>請假扣津貼，還不足表示其嚴厲，故又規定請一日假必須補兩天工，請三天以上的假，應由保證人領出廠外，這實在使我們對請假二字不敢問津。</p>
<p>三年學習期滿後，照舊式工商業裏規矩，即升任爲店員或工友，但是在我們廠裏又有新花樣，必須服務三年，服務期間的一切待遇都較其他正式工友低，若是未到期自動辭退或是被開除的話，必須將已往在廠享受的膳宿津貼算還廠方，這就叫補償損失。</p>
<p>茲將最近的零用賬，公之如下：理髮每次五元，二月理三次，每月合七元半；洗浴每次五元，一月二次，計需十元：洗衣肥皂每月一塊，需十二元；牙粉，牙刷毛巾每月平均消費五元，就此數項，已近四十元，即到工津貼分文未扣，亦不敷用，何况鞋襪，工服，襯裏杉褲等大宗頭的費用尙未列入呢！</p>

<h3 id="c45">論棉布問題 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>棉布，爲人民衣着所必需。在戰時更須有精確之供求統計。</p>
<p>數月來，當局對於棉布處置原則，大約不外二點：（一）保存現存物資。（限制棉布移動。）（二）壓低物價。（公佈棉布限價。）但檢討各種辦法之執行，似近於消極的制止，故有待於全盤的策劃。</p>
<p>夫棉布價格激烈上漲之原因，約有數端：第一次狂漲，係在去年度新舊幣交換之恐慌，但瞬即逐步回低。本年度之狂漲，一因紗廠生產量减少；二因受今春聯準券與儲鈔二比一交換及軍票收回新幣膨脹等等無稽謠傳之影響；三因業外人乘機混入市塲；更因當局恨制現貨移動，禁止棧單買賣，使商人持有貨物者，恐觸犯法令，俱存觀望，致市上流通貨額减少，供不應求，每一交易，必超過限價，成爲公開的秘密。</p>
<p>但據最近全國商業統制總會所發表之本埠棉紗布，存量極爲充實，足够供給相當年月之消費。故今日對於處置棉布整個問題，應着重存量與消費兩方全面支配計劃，（一）請求當局公佈本埠棉布存量，（存紗預算成布，）貯備幾年需用。（二）調整已定限價。因已定限價。是否適當，應有檢討之必要。但調整後之限價，如從新宣佈後，必須有決定性。已登記之存貨，永遠不使改變，以絕投機囤積之念。（三）由棉製品聯合會或棉布號同業公會，依照當局宣佈之需用時期，按月以比例接受需要方面所請求之品目，數量，（包括本外埠門售商及國外輸出量），向存貨持有人，照限價收買配給之。其收買方法，不妨仍准買賣雙方自由接洽，但其貨款交割，則必須於接洽就績後，先由需方送交棉製品聯合會或棉布號同業公會，然後付與售方，實行交割，以絕超越限價之風。（以實際配給現貨之交割爲限），如持貨人居奇不售時，得由會令收買之。（未完）</p>

<p>黃昏囘家省母親，前天給她的五元已用完了，唉！生活程度天天在飛漲：去年五元還可以支持四五天呢！</p>
<p>絳色的斜照裏，覺得很寒冽，現在不是穿夾衫的時候，但棉袍子已有七八個洞了。今春，老板已彈出了眼睛對我說：「吃綱縀店飯的，第一要穿得漂亮啊！」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我很担心，我不是担心傴僂的媽媽，而是担心着年靑的妹子，她也十六歲了呀！她會爲了環境而墮落嗎？她會受人欺騙嗎？</p>
<p>我又想到祖宗傳下來的幾間破房子，父親在時已把一排樓房賣給金姓，這次媽媽告訴我，金姓預備重價收買外面那幾間了，賣好呢，還是不賣好呢？「當然不賣！」我堅決地想。但母親迭次向金姓借用的錢已有一百多元了，那裏有錢去價還呢？呀，穿人連住幾間破房子，也沒有權利嗎？</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>今天吃飯時，老闆火罵我一頓，說我對顧客不周到，常板着臉，沒有一絲笑容，顧客不是愛看我那一副嘴臉才來的。唉，天呀，我又不是裝顰賣笑，失去靈魂的妓女，爲什麼要裝着笑去迎合人家呢？况且我只發了些呆，少殷勤了些，我是在想我的房子呀，媽呀，妹妹呀！</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>「嘻嘻，價錢是最賤的了，你放心好了。」</p>
<p>「這一匹花式最時髦，而且顏色也很好。嘻嘻」</p>
<p>我總是這樣一連串的強笑着。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻」好像是一隻猛獸的牙，她將要噬　我的靑春。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>小張被伯伯　到上海廠裏去了，他離開了這樣的苦海，我何時能脫離這可憎境地呢？</p>
<p>老板患了很重的傷寒症，我很快活。財多體弱是一定的道理，五千元本錢，而在變了七十萬。</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>今天我趁了老板的　，又到家裏去一次，恰巧妹子要想來找我，要我簽一個絕　房屋的字。唉，天曉得，我一只顫抖的手怎能簽下去呢？祖宗傳下來的房屋，我敢去出賣嗎？我放下了筆，囘絕了　婳的要求。</p>
<p>銀白色的蚯蚓從媽媽的眼角上爬下來，我的臉上也好像有些癢，胸前也有此濕了。</p>
<p>［龍兒……你知道吧！這不是我狠心……一定要賣，以後的生活怎樣……欠金家這許多錢，你舅舅處也常去借……］媽媽還要繼續說：［你爹死時只剩給我們五十塊錢，三間破房子……］</p>
<p>［媽媽我也知道的，賣去了住那裏去呢？］</p>
<p>［鄉下，你舅舅處。］</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>早上，媽媽和妹子一同動身下鄉去了，惟一祖宗傳給我們的產業，衹賣了四百元。唉，四百元扣了陳欠，剩下來的可以用多少時候呢？用完了，又怎辦呢？啊啊，不敢想。</p>
<p>今後，我是一個最孤獨的孩子了，我沒有同情和安慰，只有冷酷和白眼在向我投來。前途又是茫茫恐怕一輩子只有當這學徒，受人呼叱了吧？</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>老板病痊愈了，只病了一個半月。</p>
<p>很重的濕溫傷寒；假使是我媽媽生了，恐怕現在早在土中了。我期望求求天，把福給我媽，不要使她不安和生病。</p>
<p>收到媽一信。更使我　念着她老人家了。</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>淸晨，開店門時，四肢凍得發僵，我不顧什麼的把破棉袍穿上了身。</p>
<p>下午，小老板來看老板，他穿着筆挺的厚絨西裝。我照照鏡子，他也不比我福相，五官也和我差不多。</p>
<p>（十一）</p>
<p>午後，來了兩個年靑顧客，一男一女，老板親自和他們交易，一共買了好幾段毛織物，値五千多，付錢時，有二張十元票子，老板說它是假的，印得比較模糊，那二個卻堅持不肯調換，老板不放心，叫我拿到對面百貨公司去問。</p>
<p>這時候那來假票子呢，老板歡喜吹毛求疵，百貨店裏坐掌櫃的說好用。我囘到店裏，就把夥友的話告訴了老板和顧客，老板就紅了臉，認錯，賠罪。</p>
<p>顧客走後，老板搶起桌上的銅尺劈過來，我忙側身躲過，右腳又一抬，向我肚子上踢來，這時我可發作了，我有自由，我雖是吃他的飯，但也替他做事，究竟不是他的奴隸。</p>
<p>左手一揚，右手握拳，向他當胸打過去，他倒了，跌了一個大跟斗。</p>
<p>（十二）</p>
<p>我走了，我住在小施舍裏，覺得自己就像一只貓，雖決絕了主人，但何處是歸宿，何處去覓食呢？</p>
<p>半夜，老　怪鳴，拉起了我憶絲，媽媽常對我說：龍兒，你要忍耐呀！一個靑年必須要忍耐，忍耐才有飯吃。</p>
<p>然而，我那能再忍耐過去呢？我要自由呀！我生平不會奴隸式的阿附，是最吃虧的事，假使我能阿附，人們也會另眼看待我的了，再也用不着什麼忍耐不忍耐。總之，我是缺少了一個可貴的阿附的心。</p>
<h3 id="c47">夜 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 修經</p>
<p>暮色吞沒了絳紅的夕陽；</p>
<p>黑暗無邊地延展著。</p>
<p>沒有月光，疏星頑皮地眨著眼；</p>
<p>只有靑蛙拉長了舌簧：</p>
<p>閣閣閣……</p>
<p>彷彿藉着那充滿了生命力的聲調，</p>
<p>打破夜的靜寂。</p>
<p>鐵凳似乎不耐這淸夜的孤苦，</p>
<p>想掙脫縛束，去追蹤白天裏年靑的歌唱，</p>
<p>沉重的步伐，偶然落到草地上時，</p>
<p>靑草發出嘰嘰的低訴；</p>
<p>像是哀怨自己的靑春，無端的被人毀了。</p>
<h3 id="c48">微弱生命的沒落 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>—死了幾個人算什麼呢！　活的人多着呀！</p>
<p>「凌先生！我身體不行呢！請你給我幾天的假吧！」</p>
<p>一陣無力而微顫動的聲音，在我的耳際抖動的時候，我習熟的抬起頭來，就見到站立在自己寫字機旁的一個女工，那沒有一絲血色的臉上，兩顆失神的眼珠裏，吐露出一種無力而絕望的光芒，求助般的在注視着我。看見了，真使我有一些兒害怕，它會使我想起一個垂死的人的眼睛。</p>
<p>「好的！你就息息吧！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！」在微微顫抖着的兩片灰白嘴唇的開關裏，迸出了這三個軟弱，乏力，的字音。</p>
<p>隨着，她就拖着那沉重的步子跑開了，我默默的注視着她瘦削的背影，我開始悲哀起這一個可憐的人的命運了。</p>
<p>在幾年裏，有好幾次，有好幾個不幸的人，在這種情形以後，就永遠的消失了。</p>
<p>當一些人，帶來她們「死的消息」時，我的心總是覺得劇烈的震邊的。</p>
<p>「凌先生！我身體不行呢！請你給我幾天的假吧！」</p>
<p>那無力，軟弱，顫抖……的聲調，又在我的耳際重新的浮起了，那沒有血色的臉，失神的眼珠裏的，絕望和求助的光芒，又在我的面前閃動了。</p>
<p>「呵！可憐的人呀！」我覺得我的眼睛裏，有着一種濕濕的液體在滾動。</p>
<p>之後，工塲裏她們遺留下來的空的位置，立刻就很容易的給那些新來的後補者填滿了。</p>
<p>當我經過那些後補者的面前時，往往，我會把我的目光，着重地盤旋在她們的臉上，我看見的，全是一個個充滿着生的活力的臉龐，我有些兒悵惘了，那些可憐的死去者的臉，又在我的面前晃動了，我永不會忘記她們那種絕望和求助的眼光。記得，當她們初進工塲的時候，不是一個個都同這些活力充沛的人一樣嗎？但是，在機械把她們的生的活力吸收盡了以後，她們就一個個的成了死神面前豐盛的祭品。</p>
<p>是嗎？這些新的後補者，誰說得定它不會流入那同樣的幸運裏去呢？</p>
<p>在這勞動圈內的，一些工人死去的消息，是誰都覺得平淡的，那不過是供給一些活着的人們，一種口頭上流動性的談話資料而已，是呀！誰真會來關心一個和自己絕不相干的微弱生命的沒落呢！</p>
<p>那些不幸的死的消息，起先，在活着的人　裏，還會熱烈地談論着，或者批評着這死去者的長短。當然，這些死去者，生前，不過是一個出賣勞力的人，所以，在事實上它不會有什麼立功，立德，立言……等言行或者動業來遺傳給後世，也不會像什麼建立大事業的偉人那般的，可以留給人們以不朽的印象。所以，在不久，就誰也都會把這一件事情談忘了的。</p>
<p>每天，織機，紗　，依舊一息也不停地，沉濁的吼着，每一個工作者，也仍是那般埋下了她們的頭，彎着她們的腰，把她們瘦削的手，去控制那些無知覺的，冰冷的而呆板的機械。誰再會到記憶上去，找間那些過去的陳跡—死的消息呢！</p>
<p>我又記起了，在這勞動圈內的，某一位善於說冷話的高級職員說的一句話來：「死了幾個人算什麼呢！活的人多着呀！」</p>
<p>是的！死去的人，固然已靜靜地死去了，但是，活的人，正還多着呢！不是嗎？每天該有多少活着的人，在死亡綫上掙扎着，把她們的血和肉，在跟著生活據　着，強制地支撐着她們那瘦弱的身體，和僅有的一些殘餘的力氣，在蠕蠕的勞働着，呵！那可憐的多着的，活着的人呀！</p>
<p>「凌先生！我身體不行呢！請你給我幾天的假吧！」</p>
<p>這無力的微微顫動的聲音，隨時的都會在我的耳際重新抖動的！我在想。</p>

<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>早上喝碗稀粥就跟舅舅出去以後，一直沒歇脚的沈小根，下午囘來，背上還憑空加上二斗米，在租界裏兜幾個圈子，才拖着動都不能動的身子囘到家里。</p>
<p>「去睡會吧！」「學堂里不要去了」媽媽提過了米口袋；用着慈愛的口吻向着小根說。</p>
<p>睡確是需要睡一會，可是他想起來，他不能不到學堂里去，史先生上禮拜說過，要在今天舉行作文比賽！———是的！一點也沒錯，今天是星期四！</p>
<p>想起作文比賽，小根就立刻想起自己作文簿上的那些密圖和「甲」字，史先生說過的：</p>
<p>「沈小根項有希望！」</p>
<p>於是他掙扎著從床上爬起來，他得到學堂里去！再說，他是級長，級長是無論如何不作興缺課的！</p>
<p>「叫你睡一會你總不聽！起來做什麼？」尾角裡響起來了媽媽的聲音。</p>
<p>「我——我想到學堂里去！」小根低聲地。</p>
<p>「你作死！」媽媽生了氣：「跑了一天的路，還要到學堂里去？！」</p>
<p>「今天作文比賽」</p>
<p>「作文比賽？——不問什麼比賽都不行，我問你：你要不要命？明兒個我還打算去跟先生說，叫你不要讀了，每天去跟舅舅賺點錢，爹病了十來天……」</p>
<p>「不要讀？」小根大吃一驚：「媽！…那不能！…我才讀了半年多點……」</p>
<p>「這是你舅舅的主意！」媽到底愛兒子的：「我還要跟你爹商量過，…但是今天你總不能去！…跑了幾十里路，……而且，要去來不及了！已經六點多……天又下山，……」</p>
<p>小根絕望地爬上床。</p>
<p>史先生會出什麼題目呢？……現在他們大槪已經做好了吧？……誰先做好呢？……陳美英這囘一定得第一名了！……</p>
<p>「哀——…呀——……」</p>
<p>他不知道，這就是他的爹，看了這灰白的臉和被薄的一床被裏着的蘆柴管似的身子，小根就有一連串的囘憶，自從廠里關門之後，爹就設好好地有過生活做，先是跟着馮五叔在碼頭上做臨時苦工，囘頭就做小生意，擺攤子；再後來，就跟舅舅背杜米，一天跑上兩三囘……</p>
<p>就這麼弄壞了身體，一直咳呀咳的，有時還吐幾口血。……</p>
<p>「你就不能歇幾天？」媽常這麼抱怨。</p>
<p>「歇幾天？」爹總這樣地囘答:「你總是這富　性子，歇幾天，吃什麼？吃牛奶？還是人參燕窩？」</p>
<p>「你的身體不好！」媽嘰咕着。</p>
<p>「我曉得，」爹就低下了頭：「可是，這有什麼法子？……明知道身子不好，也得拚命挨下去！……我…我這一世是完了！小根…可要好好地活下去！…多唸點書！……爭爭氣！…」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>想呀想的，小根的眼淚流了下來。</p>
<p>晚上，舅舅來了。</p>
<p>看見舅舅，小根覺得一半是觀切，一半是厭恨。</p>
<p>「小根爹怎麼樣？」舅舅在桌子邊坐下來；「今天賺下來的總夠打帖藥！」</p>
<p>「藥是吃下去了！」媽低聲地回答：「可是：戶口米還不夠買！……」</p>
<p>「明天早點去，多跑幾次！」</p>
<p>「你明天讓他歇一天吧！」媽媽抬起頭：「他今兒吃力得要命，學堂里也沒去！」</p>
<p>「到底是孩子！沒大用！」舅舅搖著頭：「可是，下囘得練練啊！…吃苦的日子在後頭呢！……不過，我說，姐姐，你要是真靠他接他爹的後路，…就簡直不用再去唸書！…唸了有什麼用？…」</p>
<p>「不！舅舅！」小根叫起來？「我…我要唸書！我才唸了半年多……史先生說……」</p>
<p>可是桌子旁起了響雷：</p>
<p>「你要不要活？你要不要養活你爹你媽？」</p>
<p>小根伏在桌上哭了起來。</p>
<p>「小根！聽媽說！」媽走過來：「你就聽了舅舅的話吧！明兒起不用去讀了！去跟學堂里先生說一聲，……等爹有了錢，再給你去唸：…也不要唸不要錢的夜課了！…去唸好的學堂，唸大學！……」</p>
<p>小根嗚咽着，倔強地搖着頭。</p>
<p>「好！就這麼着！」舅舅站起來：「我說小根好不是糊塗孩子。……他很懂人事，會明白媽：的意思的……明兒就讓你歇一天，我明兒晚上再來！」</p>
<p>舅舅走了。</p>
<p>小根嗚咽着。</p>
<p>媽也嗚咽着。</p>
<p>外面，雨也在嗚咽着。</p>
<p>這天上午，雨一直在下着，淅瀝淅淅瀝地。</p>
<p>下午，雨小些，他到學堂里去。</p>
<p>羅寶康，大頭鬼，施榮德，他們都在校門口玩。</p>
<p>「哦！沈小根來了！——咦！你的書包呢？」</p>
<p>「沈小根！你爲什麼不說話？」</p>
<p>「咦！怎麼一聲不　？搭架子？」</p>
<p>「沈小根！你變了啞子了麼？」</p>
<p>「跟誰吵了架！」</p>
<p>小根低下頭，一聲不響地走進校門，後面跟着一大　同學。</p>
<p>「沈小根—你爲什麼不來？」史先生正在改卷子。</p>
<p>「他去背米！」大頭鬼搶着囘答！「羅實康到他家裡的的！」</p>
<p>「背米？」史先生不相信地！「你家里大人呢？」</p>
<p>「爹生了病，……睡了十幾天……沒吃過一帖藥！……戶口米又沒有錢買……」</p>
<p>「能赚多少一天？」</p>
<p>「昨天……」小根搖搖頭！「昨天……跑了一天，……才夠打一帖藥！……可是，爹……今天，還是那樣！……」</p>
<p>史先生不應了，小根聽見他在輕輕地嘆息。</p>
<p>同學們都屏住呼吸，睜大了眼，一聲不響地。</p>
<p>「史先生！……」小根終於鼓起勇氣；「……媽說的……以後每天要去……背米，所以…我…我…不講了！……」</p>
<p>史先生靜默着，好像早已知道似的。</p>
<p>羅寶康，大頭鬼，施榮德跟許許多多的同學們也靜默着，沒有一點兒聲音。</p>
<p>誰都覺得心上像有塊大石頭壓着……</p>
<p>「嘡嘡！嘡嘡！嘡嘡！……」鍾聲熟悉地響起來。</p>
<p>同學們一個個戀戀不捨地走出辦公室。</p>
<p>「沈小根！你以後常來玩啊！」大頭鬼最後出去。</p>
<p>小根舉起了衣袖，慢慢地擦着眼睛。</p>
<p>「別難過！」史先生的聲音也變了：「……我平常不是跟你們說過多少次嗎？……真正的大人物的幼年時代，都不是進學樣的！……你很聰明，也很用功！……你是很有希望的！……有空，儘管來問我！」</p>
<p>「史先生！你真……」小根抬起流滿淚的臉。</p>
<p>「我知道你的苦處！」史先生點點頭：「可是這是沒有辦法的事，等你爹好了以後，你再來好了！」</p>
<p>「我…走…了！……」他想起媽會叫他早點囘去。</p>
<p>他疑遲的舉起了腳步，隔壁的敎室裏——那間熟悉的敎室裡，何先生正在跟每天一樣地講着算術，同學們，依舊跟每天一樣地靜靜地坐着，聽着，等會，也仍會跟每天一樣地做題目，跟每天一樣地下課……可是，……</p>
<p>走出校門，他的眼淚又流了下來。</p>
<p>他記得，去年秋天，當爹從外面囘來，告訴他在電桿木上看見了一個義務夜校的招生廣告而叫他去報名的時候，他曾是多麼的喜悅，他終於踏進了學校的大門！……就是爹跟媽，也常跟人講起！「小根現在進學堂了！」……</p>
<p>他也記得，同學們曾是怎樣地爲他的成績好而選他做級長，——雖然在這一班里，他是年紀最小的一個！……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>終於，他走到了家里。</p>
<p>「小根爹！…小根爹！…你醒來呀！…你……你……」媽跪在床前急促地叫喚着。</p>
<p>他突然感到一陣莫名的恐怖，他身劇烈地戰悚着，慌張地跑到床前去。</p>
<p>爹依就是那樣，靜靜地　在床上，灰白的臉　　黃豆大個的汗珠，眼閉着，顴骨高高地突起，頭發係一蓬亂草……</p>
<p>「小根爹！……」媽終於器出來。</p>
<p>爹的眼睛睜開了，微弱的眼光慢慢地掃了一下，用了極大的力氣搖搖頭，斷續地：</p>
<p>「…我…是…不…行…了…小…根…可要…好好地…活…下…去！…多…唸……點…書！……」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>卅二。五。十七。深夜。雨聲中。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Decisive Stage Is About To Begin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The period of drastic changes in the world war situation is approaching, and all parties are preparing for the start of the decisive stage.</p>
<p>The end of the battles in Tunis and Bizerte is a turning point in the world war. There is no doubt that the so-called real war may break out on any near tomorrow. The question is the future focus of the war and the trends it may develop, which is precisely the focus of the contradictions among the anti-Axis powers today. The so-called "strategic dispute" arises here, and the result is undoubtedly a great benefit to the Axis powers. As the saying goes, "A cat that shouts cannot catch mice." The clamor of the Allies before the decisive battle and the composure of the Axis powers may somewhat hint at the future!</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire war situation, after the end of the North African war, according to the judgment of the anti-Axis military observers, their victory is built on immediately launching an attack on Europe. Otherwise, the initiative will be in the hands of the Axis powers, and not only London but also New York may encounter a sudden attack. However, the anti-Axis countries have experienced new conflicts at this time. The British rulers, led by Churchill, adhering to the view of "national interests first," insisted on the selfish strategic policy of "defeating Hitler first." He persuaded the United States to send the largest force to Europe and even tried to trick Stalin into taking chestnuts out of the fire for them in the East to appease Roosevelt. However, this kind of strategy has obviously aroused great resentment among the US Army and Navy. Senator Chandler, who was once regarded as Roosevelt's loyal confidant, recently delivered a speech in Congress that fully exposed the deep unease of the US rulers, criticizing Churchill's Europe-centric strategy. He warned Roosevelt: "When Britain and the Soviet Union are vying for Europe, the US President will bitterly feel that he has lost the right to speak in the world." Therefore, this movement against the "Europe-centric strategy" has spread in the United States. We have every reason to point out that while Washington is still debating, the new starting point of the world war situation has already begun in a certain place and in several places. Because the Axis powers no longer need to have any compromises in strategy, their interests are completely aligned, which is the first characteristic before the start of the decisive stage.</p>
<p>It is certainly impossible to judge where the future decisive battle will be staged. However, as we pointed out the other day, the Mediterranean theater will first concentrate the firepower of both sides. Italy has now declared a state of war throughout the country, and all its people are on the front line, uniting their strength to resist a possible enemy landing operation. The amazing air war has already begun for several days. Judging from the current situation, due to the consolidation of the defense capabilities of Sicily and Sardinia, and the daily strengthening of the German-Italian joint defense forces in southern Italy, the control of the central Mediterranean is firmly in the hands of the Axis powers. Relying on this, the enemy's conspiracies against Turkey and Spain cannot take effect, and the Axis powers also have sufficient time to strengthen the defense lines of thousands of miles in southern and western France, in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, and at the same time, they can carry out operations to eliminate enemy activities and strengthen mobilization in the Balkan Peninsula. Conversely, after the huge consumption of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, it is not easy to gather the offensive power from the vast areas of Africa, west to England and east to the Near East, especially since there are still old and new contradictions within.</p>
<p>There has been three months of silence on the German-Soviet front. This is the time for both sides to desperately prepare. Now, according to some information announced by both sides, it can be said that they both admit that each other's preparations have been quite complete, and the decisive war has reached the stage where it can break out at any time. Although the situation in Europe is completely different from the African war situation last year, the decisive position of the German-Soviet war in the world war situation has not only not decreased, but has increased even more. In Tunis and Bizerte, the Axis powers resisted enemy forces with a small force of more than ten divisions, which was not much smaller than the number of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front, and perhaps even better in quality, for more than three months. However, on the Eastern Front, the Axis powers do not deny that they have concentrated ten times the force of North Africa, and have been buried in preparation for three months without lightly using it. It is obvious that the Axis powers never deny their main target of attack. Therefore, it is more meaningful to pay attention to the development of the German-Soviet war than to value the disputes between Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington, Churchill's illusions about Stalin, and the daydreams of Roosevelt's faction about "counterattacking Japan." The decisive battle that we call will break out on any near tomorrow also lies here.</p>
<p>Before the decisive stage arrives, in order to conceal their true intentions and to guard against the tyranny of Britain and the Soviet Union, Roosevelt's faction created some incidents in the Pacific, such as the adventurous landing on Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands, which had been occupied by the Japanese army for a year. The enemy's propaganda machine spared no effort to promote these events. But its effect is only temporary deception, and it will not succeed even in Chongqing and Australia. The facts have made Chongqing and Australia feel disappointed and resentful towards the so-called "allies." Even the British side does not believe in this trick of the United States, so in his speech to the US Congress, Churchill pointed out that "the largest part of the US force is in the Pacific," which is such humorous irony in front of the Americans, because what "the largest part of the US force" has shown is the greatest defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Record of the Russo-Japanese War in This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpt (4) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that in the future, the responsibility for defending the Pacific will entirely lie with the Asians, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States must not be allowed to intervene. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval power. Our ally Japan has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its talent by defeating the many with the few. In this Greater East Asia War, it has exerted its invincible power even more. At present, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our ally, and we deeply regret that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we should emulate the navy of our ally in the future, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the people of our country should jointly strive to catch up with. In order to enhance the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper has excerpted the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago as a new excerpt, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. I hope readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Blocking the Port of Lushun (Recorded in This Newspaper No. 11088, Guangxu 30th Year, January 17th, Western Calendar March 3rd, 1904, Thursday) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese blocking of the port of Lushun has been repeatedly reported in telegraphic dispatches. Now, reading a certain Japanese Tokyo daily newspaper, it says: On February 23rd of the Eastern Calendar (i.e., the eighth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) to the 24th, the naval commander-in-chief Togo personally supervised the fleet to attack with great effort. How effective it was has not been reported. However, Togo is usually bold and careful, and at this time, he is expected to return with victory. As for the stone ships blocking Lushun, one is the Incheon Maru of the Postal Ship Company, weighing 2,331 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1877 AD. One is the Hokoku Maru of Kawamura Sakichi from Hyogo Prefecture, weighing 2,766 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1870 AD. One is the Buyo Maru of the Merchant Ship Company, weighing 563 tons, with a steel and iron hull, manufactured in 1889 AD. One is the Bushu Maru of the Merchant Ship Company, weighing 1,289 tons, with a steel hull, manufactured in 1883 AD. It is also heard that the Russian governor Alekseyev's public telegram said: On February 24th of the Western Calendar (i.e., the ninth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar), at 2:45 AM, when the waning moon had sunk and the morning stars had not yet risen, the Japanese attacked Lushun again with torpedo boats, and also used four ships loaded with flammable materials, intending to sink them to block the port. The Russian Lt. Utyugov Battery fired and bombarded them, and two ships were destroyed near the port. Then, with electric lights illuminating the distance, four ships were seen to be broken. Eight torpedo boats sailed into the Japanese fleet, surged back with waves. At present, the port is still open to traffic and there are no obstacles.</p>

<p>A certain Osaka newspaper in Japan published an official report obtained by the Russian Consul General stationed in Shanghai, roughly saying that on the nights of February 22nd (i.e., the seventh day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) and 23rd (i.e., the eighth day), warships suddenly attacked Lushun and were repelled by us. In the darkness, it was not known which country's ships they were, nor what kind of ships they were. Only six damaged ships were seen. The Russian military attaché stationed in Lushun telegraphed that: On February 24th of the Western Calendar (i.e., the ninth day of the first month of the Chinese Calendar) at 2:00 AM, Japanese torpedo boats crossed to the port of Lushun and attacked the battery, and also used eight ships loaded with rocks, intending to block the port gate. The Russian commander, seeing this, quickly ordered the Lt. Utyugov ship to join the battery and fire, and the Japanese boats, seeing the Lt. Utyugov ship, flew forward. Soon, two ships were stranded on a shoal, and one was sunk near the Golden Hill Lighthouse. At this time, the night was very clear, and soon four more ships were seen sinking one after another, and eight torpedo boats retreated to the fleet. Among the sunken ships, half of the sailors drowned, and half were missing. As for whether there was any damage to the Japanese fleet, it was not very clear from the shore. Only that it was divided into two teams and headed towards the horizon. The ships damaged on February 9th of the Western Calendar (i.e., December 24th of the Chinese Calendar last year) were quickly repaired and will soon be able to engage in battle in the vast sea again.</p>

<p>A certain Japanese Tokyo daily newspaper said: The battle of Lushun was recently telegraphed by the naval commander Togo, roughly saying: Our Japanese warships, as expected, agreed to besiege the port of Lushun on March 10th of the Eastern Calendar. On the night of the 9th, after 11:00 PM, first order the torpedo boat fleet to reconnoiter outside the port of Lushun for a week. By dawn on the 10th, it was divided into two teams, A and B. Team A used a specially made machine to sink mines outside the port. The Russian battery commander saw it and immediately fired remotely. Our ships were undamaged and were able to sink the mines and return. At about 4:30 AM, Team A, with six ships, went straight to the south of Old Iron Mountain and approached the enemy's torpedo boats. After fighting for about 30 minutes, our "Asashio," "Kasumi," and "Akatsuki" ships almost rubbed against the sides of the enemy ships. The enemy ships fired fiercely with three or four ships. Soon, the enemy ships received multiple shells, either damaging the machinery or causing fires in the cabins. Only the wails of the soldiers were heard. It is not known how many were injured. When the enemy ships were defeated and fled, our "Asashio," "Kasumi," and "Akatsuki" ships had also been heavily damaged by enemy shells. A total of seven soldiers were killed on the ships. On "Kasumi," the chief engineer Nanzawa Yasuo and seven soldiers were injured. On "Akatsuki," the boiler exploded, and hot water spewed out, killing four soldiers instantly. By this point, all three ships were unable to sail. Team B, at 7:00 AM, arrived outside the port, and, seeing two enemy torpedo boats in the ocean, went straight ahead to block their return route and opened fire. After about a minute of battle, both sides suffered heavy damage. Soon, one enemy ship fled like an arrow. The one named Si Tieliu Siqi was driven under the fortress and was injured by our shells. The Lian ship seized him and dragged him back with a huge rope. At that time, the sea was turbulent and the water was gurgling in from the shell holes. They had no choice but to cut the rope and detain four enemy soldiers. At 10:15 AM, the enemy ship gradually sank. After the event, it was found that two soldiers were killed and Lieutenant Shima Yuukichi and three soldiers were injured on the Lian and Akebono ships. Previously, the enemy ships Novik and Boyarin flew out of the port and were pursued by Team B of our army. Later, seeing our cruiser fleet approaching, they turned back again. Our main naval force and cruiser fleet arrived at the sea off Lushun at 8:00 AM on that day to support the torpedo boat fleet. Soon, the ships of our main force changed direction and advanced towards Old Iron Mountain, while the cruiser fleet went straight to the port gate. From 10:00 AM to 1:40 PM, the main force fired at the shore, and the shells hit the enemy's key points. The enemy also fired in response, but our ships were undamaged. Another cruiser team went to the sea outside Dalian Bay and bombarded the enemy's warehouses and camps on Sanshan Island from afar. The Takasago and Chihaya ships reconnoitered the enemy's situation on the west coast of the Lushun Peninsula and saw the enemy ship Uknichtliy, which had been broken in the previous attack, sunk in the shallow waters of Pigeon Bay, with only the masts and chimneys slightly exposed above the water.</p>

Although it lasted for two months, the morale has become more and more vigorous, and it is also responsible for security work, in order to prepare for the future war. If the Chongqing and communist armies try to act rashly again, the Japanese army will inevitably attack them anytime and anywhere. Now, the residents of various places in the area fully trust the policies of the Japanese army and the administrative organs of the Chinese side, and are working hard to revive China and protect East Asia, and will not easily believe in the schemes and propaganda of the Chongqing and communist sides in the future.

<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - All circles in Chongqing are extremely concerned about the Luo Qiu talks currently being held in Washington. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly convened meetings with the highest-ranking officials such as Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, and Xiong Shihui, and, based on the reports of Song Ziwen and Wei Daoming, has discussed countermeasures. According to various sources, it is known that the Chongqing side is quite dissatisfied with the argument of the Europe-first operation principle still insisted on in the Washington talks. It also pointed out that Japan is currently using Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam and Malaysia as bases for cultivating combat power, so Japan's strategic position is becoming increasingly consolidated, in order to arouse the attention of Britain and the United States. The main points of its advocacy of the equal emphasis on Europe and Asia principle are (1) to increase the deployment of troops for the purpose of opening up overseas routes, and especially to actively prepare for the counteroffensive operation in Burma; (2) to increase the establishment of air force bases and supply liaison agencies from the US Pacific coast to the border between Burma and India; (3) to actively transport aircraft, military supplies, and resources to Chongqing, etc. However, the progress of the Luo Qiu meeting still tends to focus on Europe, and only gives slight consideration to the position of Chongqing. The Chongqing Dagongbao also expressed pessimism about this situation on the 20th.</p>

<p>Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the International Communist Party, on the 22nd, citing the serious current world situation, proposed a plan to dissolve the International Communist Organization. The proposal was signed by the Secretary-General of the International Communist Party and representatives of communist parties from various countries, but representatives from Britain and the United States were not listed. According to the committee's statement yesterday, the reason for the dissolution was that since the establishment of the International Communist Organization in 1919, the international situation has changed drastically, especially after the outbreak of this war, and the situation has become even more serious. Therefore, the international organization of the vanguard of the working class is no longer suitable for the international situation. The International Communist Organization must be dissolved, but communist parties in various countries should do their best to support the war effort in the future.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources: British Ambassador Lord Halifax met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday, mainly to discuss the dissolution of the Third International.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Swedish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter" published an interview with Davies on the 21st, stating: I visited Stalin at 9:00 AM today and personally handed him a letter from President Roosevelt, and did not leave until 11:30 AM. I regret that I cannot disclose the contents of the letter. However, I can tell you that the letter was very long. After Stalin received it, he had someone translate it into Russian, and he listened attentively. He also said that he planned to meet with me again in the coming days.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Demands</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas reported, citing sources in Lisbon with close ties to US senators in Washington: The dissolution of the Third International announced in Moscow yesterday was actually initiated by President Roosevelt. The US side is confident that President Roosevelt made specific demands regarding this matter in a letter delivered to Stalin by his special envoy, Davies. Roosevelt's demands were roughly as follows: (1) President Roosevelt strongly urged Stalin to be more cautious in his political strategies than in the past, because Moscow announced its political and military goals too early, which led to the failure to eliminate the hostility between Finland and the Soviet Union. (2) President Roosevelt asked Stalin to be particularly careful in announcing the Soviet Union's war aims towards its western neighbors, especially regarding Poland, the Balkans, and Turkey. The premature announcement of the Soviet Union's annexation plans would strengthen the determination of these countries to resist. (3) President Roosevelt asked Stalin to effectively help eliminate tensions within Britain and the United States. To achieve this goal, he proposed the immediate or at least formal dissolution of international communist organizations and the end of the Comintern. (4) In return for Stalin's fulfillment of the above demands, President Roosevelt announced his willingness to allow Stalin to arbitrarily dispose of European affairs related to Soviet interests when peace is concluded.</p>
<p>Suggestion to Convene a Four-Power Conference</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas's special correspondent stationed here stated last night: Special Envoy Davies had read the contents of President Roosevelt's long letter to Stalin beforehand. The reason why the US side spread the propaganda that Davies was unaware of the contents was because Roosevelt feared that premature disclosure of important parts of the letter would hinder the success of Davies' mission. This matter has become an open secret among Americans here, who learned about it through connections with some senators in Washington, but their names have not yet been identified. Although the accuracy of this information cannot be guaranteed to be entirely reliable, the source of the information about the contents of the letter and several other facts disclosed at the same time guarantee the accuracy of the above information. The letter mentioned world military strategies. It also emphasized the need to concentrate greater military strength in preparation for an offensive.</p>
<p>German Diplomatic Circles Express Views</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry issued its views on the Soviet Union's dissolution of the International Communist Party on the 22nd, stating in essence: The Soviet Union's dissolution of the International Communist Party is clearly a deliberate deception. Stalin has taken this step to be able to join the anti-Axis powers, laying the foundation for a meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. However, this move is a major blow to anti-Semitic and anti-communist elements in the United States. Stalin has dissolved the Third International, but at the same time, he has established the Fourth International. Stalin had previously declared that he would bring Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and other Southeastern European countries into his sphere of influence. Today's move further solidifies this policy, and he intends to establish Soviet governments of different forms in these countries. In short, Stalin dared to take this measure because of Roosevelt. Roosevelt can only maintain his pro-Stalin policy through this, and allow the Soviet Union to develop freely towards Europe. However, European countries are currently fighting to preserve Europe from communist ideology, and they will certainly not be affected by Stalin's move. They will continue to challenge communism until it is eradicated.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Axis Pact. Today, German newspapers prominently displayed headlines reiterating the close relationship between Germany and Italy. "Völkischer Beobachter" stated: The alliance established on May 22, 1939, established the basic principles of the two countries' foreign policy, and both sides still adhere to them today. "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated: The enemy's coercion has instead promoted the alliance between Germany and Italy to create a new Europe, mutually building a new order with firm determination.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - This month, the 23rd, marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the German-Italian military agreement. Berlin held a commemorative celebration on this day, presided over by Dr. Clodius, Vice President of the German-Italian Association. German representatives included Deputy Foreign Minister Schnurre and senior officials from military, political, and party circles. Italian representatives included Ambassador to Germany Alfieri and members of various embassies. Ambassador Alfieri delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing Italy's determination to complete the war, stating: From the beginning of Italy's participation in the war, it was deeply aware that the war would inevitably progress to an extremely fierce and difficult situation. It is believed that although the Axis forces are forced to retreat locally, it has no impact on deciding the entire war situation. Prime Minister Mussolini once said: Although Italy's plan to build an African empire on the African continent is temporarily difficult to achieve, it will eventually make efforts again to achieve success. Even if enemy aircraft bombing is fierce, Italian morale will never be shaken. The Italian people are determined to always unite around the King and, under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini, strive for final victory and move forward with unwavering belief. I am confident that the common determination, common interests, and friendly feelings between the heads of state and people of Germany and Italy are the best guarantee for the Axis powers to achieve final victory.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from Virginia Hot Springs, there are extremely divergent opinions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the anti-Axis food conference currently being held there. Therefore, a second conference may be convened. The agenda of this conference is to discuss the allocation of food after the war, not to discuss the urgent issue of immediately transporting food to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet delegation is not satisfied, so it plans to convene a second conference to discuss the Soviet demands in order to appease the Soviet Union. However, this plan has not yet materialized. It is believed that US State Department official Acheson has been ordered to mediate the current disputes. It is expected that the second conference will also be held in Hot Springs and will only be attended by delegations from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Air Supremacy and Naval Warfare (II) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Sato Kiichiro, Translated from Kaizo, May Issue</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Leaving aside the Greater East Asia War, the European war has shown that no matter how powerful a fleet is, it cannot accomplish its mission without the cooperation of the air force. Needless to say, the tasks of the fleet at sea are to destroy enemy fleets at sea or at bases, attack various enemy coastal facilities, destroy communication and transportation lines and trade lines, protect our maritime transportation and communication lines, and cover land troops. However, the results of these fleet operations can be said to be determined by the extent of first, air supremacy, and second, the freedom of fleet actions in the combat or aerial-maritime zones. However, these first and second conditions are not inherently separable. Without the first condition, the second condition can hardly be established. In other words, air supremacy is the precursor to sea control. The so-called "sea control from the air" illustrates this relationship.</p>
<p>Sea control from the air - in other words, the best example of the air force's victory over the navy can be seen in the German army's Norwegian operation. The German army's Norwegian operation occupied the air bases immediately before the British, and landed the army by warships and transport aircraft. The British fleet hurriedly escorted the transport convoys to Norway, but because it did not consider the following of air power, it was attacked by a fleet of 150 German bombers 100 to 200 kilometers off the coast. Soon, the transport convoy of battleships and cruisers was easily eliminated. This contains the significance of the German air force, which gained air bases on land, capturing or destroying enemy ships within the 200-kilometer air supremacy circle at sea. It is nothing more than the fact that in the face of air supremacy, sea control and everything else disappear into smoke.</p>
<p>When the German army carried out the Norwegian operation, the most painstaking thing was the difficulty of landing troops simultaneously in the harbor scattered across the narrow territory of the winding 1,000 kilometers. This operation was unprecedented. Therefore, the harbors of Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, Stettin, Tangier, and Mergaardin Hafen, from which troops were transported, were first strictly defended with fighters and anti-aircraft guns. Secondly, when transporting the troops, they were protected by the Messerchmitt, a twin-engine, reciprocating aircraft with a speed of 600 kilometers per hour, which had never been dispatched by the German air force. At the same time, bombers were dispatched to the North Sea to sink British warships. Moreover, on the 3rd, 8th, and 10th of April, sixty aircraft were formed into seven teams, repeatedly bombing the British mainland's Scapa Flow military port. The British Air Force was completely unable to take off from the airfield during the day and could only move at night. Therefore, the only thing that could detect the German army's movements was the German fleet's sudden information of moving at sea.</p>
<p>In this way, at dawn on April 9, the German battleship Scharnhorst, the cruiser Hippel, and other destroyers landed troops on the Norwegian coast, and the operation began. In just three days, the landing in the seaports of Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Arendal, and Oslo succeeded. Then, airlift was carried out by transport aircraft to seize the enemy's airfield behind the defense line. Taking Oslo as an example, a transport plane protected by five fighters landed at a nearby civil airfield on the 9th. One hundred and twenty soldiers jumped out of the transport plane and captured the airfield within fifteen minutes, allowing subsequent transport planes to land safely and quickly, and 3,000 soldiers landed in less than an hour. In addition, Stavanger was occupied by parachute troops.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the British Navy received a report of the German fleet leaving the port and immediately dispatched the Northern Fleet with the battleship Renown as its flagship, equipped with nine twin mine boats, to the coast from Tromsø to Narvik, to be responsible for setting up mines and landing marines. A Southern Fleet consisting of the battleship Rodnaya, the cruiser Aurora, and nine destroyers and mine boats was dispatched to Bergen to prevent the German fleet from heading north. However, the German fleet had not only entered the port of Narvik hours before, but both the Northern and Southern Fleets were fiercely bombarded by German bombers. Especially the Southern Fleet, the battleship Rodnaya was hit by all bombs, the cruiser Aurora suffered even more severe damage, and the destroyer Gergaga sank within four and a half hours. The two fleets fled back to base in embarrassment.</p>
<p>For this defeat, the British Navy hoped to make a comeback and reorganized a large fleet with the battleship Forthright as its flagship, equipped with several cruisers and destroyers, and many other small warships, and advanced towards Narvik. On April 13, it inflicted great damage on seven German mine boats. Soon, it was discovered by a large group of German bombers dispatched to rescue friendly forces. Several were fatally damaged, and the attempt to land in Narvik became a pipe dream, and they had to retreat again.</p>
<p>At that time, the British Air Force also dispatched attacks on German warships and airfields in the Kristiansand, Bergen, and Stavanger areas, but the German army strengthened these airfields with fighters on the 12th, and the attacks had no effect.</p>
<p>After that, until the Norwegian army surrendered on June 9, the German and British armies continued to fight to the death. British warships were defeated by German bombers several times. The battleship Forthright, the cruiser Carr, HMS Effingham and many other mine boats and minesweepers were sunk.</p>
<p>The Norwegian operation, as mentioned at the beginning, was always a victory for the German Air Force's active operations. The German army's strategy was to occupy the airfields in Denmark and Norway from the beginning, bring the aviation base closer to the front line, quickly seize air supremacy, and make it easier for friendly fleets to land and fight. At the same time, it set up an air supremacy circle far at sea to defeat the British fleet. However, the British Navy placed the aviation base at a location far away from the front line. Therefore, while the imposing fleet sailed forward, it was often attacked by German bombers and suffered defeat.</p>

<p>The problem of repatriating refugees and beggars in the two concessions and the city has been under discussion for a long time. It is now known that this ideal can become a reality. The World Red Cross has been ordered to conduct on-site inspections in Dachang to complete the beggar repatriation plan.</p>
<p>Develop Self-Sufficient Life for Beggars</p>
<p>Repatriating beggars is indeed one of the social problems in this city, so it has long been paid attention to by the authorities. Building beggar residences in Dachang is intended to maintain public health in the bustling city of Shanghai, and it is hoped that infectious diseases in the hot season can be reduced. According to relevant sources, this plan is expected to be realized in the near future.</p>
<p>Chairman Instructs World Red Cross</p>
<p>Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Municipal Council, is also very keen to solve the beggar problem. During the street cleaning campaign at the beginning of this month, he expressed his determination to repatriate street beggars to representatives of various baojia and self-defense groups. Later, the World Red Cross was inspired by Chairman Okazaki and was responsible for handling the repatriation work.</p>
<p>Heads of Various Districts Discuss with Each Other</p>
<p>Last week, the heads of the three municipal districts in this city approached each other to discuss and seek solutions to this problem. It is also reported that the Nanshi authorities have also engaged in the practical solution of this problem, taking the same steps as other authorities. Beggar businesses in Dachang are under construction and are expected to accommodate 5,000 people, although this has not yet fully accommodated all the beggars in the city. The World Red Cross has a very large plan for the management of the beggar camp. The beggars who are taken in, especially the younger ones, will be taught agricultural skills and other commercial knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Eliminating Latent Power <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Wei</p>
<p>If we want to revitalize society and consolidate national power, I believe that abandoning latent power is the most important fundamental task. Why do I say this? The reasons are stated as follows:</p>
<p>First, let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of latent power. People who are untalented and incompetent rely on the latent power of their fathers, uncles, and other relatives to hold high positions. They are full of sycophantic flattery, and in a few years, they strut around, pretending to be important figures. Examining their actual knowledge, they are only capable of socializing, frequenting entertainment venues, and being mere good-for-nothings. On the other hand, those with real talent and learning remain underlings for a long time. And it is the latter who support and advance society. If the former occupy their positions and do not leave, the latter cannot rise. This is one reason for abandoning latent power.</p>
<p>Let's look at the distorted development of current society. Those in power use their authority and rely on the latent power of their positions to flaunt their power and indulge their selfish desires, thus creating extremely terrible consequences. The tragic death of Zhang Jinhai this time is greatly related to the use of latent power by certain parties. This is the second reason for abandoning latent power.</p>
<p>Let's look at the high prices in Shanghai. The reason is hoarding and speculation, and initially, it was hoarders from all walks of life who used their latent power to hoard large quantities of goods. (For example, bank personnel once used their authority to engage in speculation.) Therefore, tracing the root cause, the existence of latent power is a major reason for the increasing cost of living. This is the third reason for abandoning latent power.</p>
<p>Let's look at current society: money is the highest authority, and everything is about money. Having money means having power, which means having latent power. With money, anything can be done, while many poor but knowledgeable people are looked down upon and despised. Why is this? It is because people in general value money too much and value latent power too much. Therefore, if we want to correct such a bad phenomenon and eliminate this bad concept, abandoning latent power is a task that cannot be delayed for a moment. This is the fourth reason for abandoning latent power.</p>
<p>Since the disadvantages of latent power are as described above, we must abandon it in order to make society vigorous and national power prosperous. But how do we abandon it? This question is very complicated. First, we must understand the reasons for the existence of latent power and understand its crux before we can completely abandon it. So, let's first look for the source of latent power. The causes can be divided into the following types:</p>
<p>(1) The existence of latent power is because people in society do not value talent and instead focus on cultivating their own relatives and friends into a faction, forming so-called cliques, and cultivating their own power, suppressing dissidents, thus creating so-called latent power.</p>
<p>(2) Those in high positions engage in embezzlement and corruption due to the convenience of their authority. They use the advantage of their position to form latent power and act recklessly, doing whatever they want.</p>
<p>(3) Those who are in subordinate positions, in order to preserve their jobs, do not hesitate to do private matters for their superiors and cover up for their superiors, which makes those in high positions more unscrupulous and cultivates deeply rooted latent power.</p>
<p>Due to the above points, we can know that latent power is man-made. Whoever tied the bell on the tiger must untie it, so to abandon latent power, the public must release their power to complete it together.</p>
<p>We should not drag our untalented and incompetent friends and relatives to cultivate our own power; we should not abuse our authority to engage in embezzlement and corruption; we should not be afraid of losing our jobs if we do not do private matters for our superiors; we should work impartially and selflessly. Only in this way will latent power disappear, society will flourish, politics will move onto the right track, and the country will be revitalized!</p>
<h3 id="e40">How Should the Famine in Henan Province Be Relieved? <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Weili</p>
<p>This year, a drought occurred in Henan Province. Regarding the situation in the disaster area, the Shen Bao has previously published an article that described it in detail. According to people from Xinxiang County, the severity of the famine in Henan Province is currently increasing, and the worst areas are Wuzhi and Qinyang (Huaiqing Prefecture) counties. Last year, the Qin River once flooded, and after the water receded, the land was covered with a foot of sticky mud (sticky soil). This kind of soil is not suitable for planting without sufficient rainfall, so the compatriots in the vicinity have exhausted their food supply and are now using bran, wheat middlings, tree bark, grass roots, peanut shells, etc. to fill their stomachs. However, after autumn, all the plants will wither, so it is not difficult to imagine what will happen to the people of Henan Province at that time. Therefore, how to relieve the famine in Henan Province is a matter that the authorities and philanthropists in general should pay close attention to. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly state the methods of relief as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Transport food to the disaster area as soon as possible. The authorities should designate personnel to handle relief matters. The procedure should be to first estimate the amount of food needed in the disaster area, and then find ways to transport food to the disaster area as soon as possible. What is even more important is how to ensure that the victims receive real relief after the food arrives in the disaster area. In other words, we should try our best to eliminate the matter of enriching one's own pockets by using disaster relief.</p>
<p>(2) Establish agricultural loans for farmers to facilitate well drilling as soon as possible. Although the disaster area failed to plant last year, which resulted in this year's summer and autumn harvest, this is limited to wheat and early-maturing sorghum and millet. As for late-maturing corn, mung beans, buckwheat, etc., it is not too late to plant them a month later. Therefore, the authorities should urgently establish agricultural loans in the disaster area to help people dig wells and purchase waterwheels. If this can be realized as soon as possible, then not only can the current famine be relieved, but future famines can also be reduced or even disappear.</p>
<p>The above are just the urgent tasks of the authorities. As for what philanthropists in Shanghai should do, it is to generously donate money in order to provide the authorities with great assistance. Accordingly, I believe that major newspapers in this port should quickly establish an organization to collect donations for the relief of the Henan drought, just like collecting donations for Mr. Zhang Qiu Jinnan. This will definitely be welcomed by the press, which serves society, and philanthropists in Shanghai will definitely be enthusiastic in their donations. (Manuscript fees are used for donations)</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Necessity of Revitalizing Small Industries <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>At a time when the issues of hoarding and prices are causing anxiety, news has spread that some small industries are emerging in Shanghai, which is very meaningful. So far, the industries that can be included in this category are rickshaws, tricycles, pharmaceuticals, and soap. It would be too easy to conclude from this fact that the economy of Central China has begun to recover. However, in this fact, we should recognize the resilience or environmental adaptability of the economy in general, and the Chinese economy in particular.</p>
<p>To put it a bit too strongly, the recent economic direction of Central China has become too dominated by a controlled economy. Considering China's status under participation in the war, a controlled economy is necessary, but its control spirit and method are too formulaic. At least most people feel that way. A controlled economy must be limited by considering the particularities of each national economy. What is considered appropriate in developed countries, in the eyes of those who do not understand, may be considered as a way to suppress the Chinese economy. Therefore, for China's controlled economy, we must first have the best possible ideal, and then seek its realization. We are not saying that this result was produced because of the progress or the difficult state of the General Chamber of Commerce, but there is no doubt that there are many things that should be reflected upon there.</p>
<p>What does the rise of small industries mean against this background? This is a natural development that occurs before China's controlled economy reaches full activity. The Chinese controlled economy currently being prepared uses the smooth flow of materials to increase production, with the aim of realizing the revival of the Chinese economy. The rise of small industries cannot be regarded as unplanned, it should be regarded as an effort to directly achieve this goal. If there is an abundance of materials, this effort may be hindered by the controlled economy, but the reality of the Central Chinese economy is just the opposite, only the controlled economy can help this effort to progress.</p>
<p>Not only in Shanghai, but also in other places, if there are production enterprises that are about to emerge, regardless of their size, they should be given assistance. We eagerly hope that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce will provide more assistance to small industries, and the effect will be great. We further hope that the Chinese and Japanese government authorities and the General Chamber of Commerce will promote the revitalization of small industries from a broad perspective and devote their efforts to guidance, which is greatly expected.

<h3 id="e42">Banking Industry Loans for the Purchase of Spring Cocoons and Wheat; Settlement of Accounts Will Be Handled When the Dragon Boat Festival Approaches <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>After the banking industry conducted agricultural loans to revive the rural economy, China Communications and other banks have formed an agricultural loan syndicate, temporarily limited to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which will actively carry out the work by dividing the area. In addition, loans will be granted for the purchase of agricultural products such as spring cocoons, wheat, rice, and beans. The principle has been decided and will be handled by various banks. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Spring Cocoon Loan</p>
<p>Silk factories and silk cocoon merchants can apply to banks for loans to purchase spring cocoons. It is reported that the total amount of spring cocoon loans already concluded is about 10 million yuan. Recently, cocoon shops in Zhejiang have opened scales. However, because the number of cocoon shops has been fully opened, the production of spring cocoons has decreased compared with previous years, resulting in each cocoon shop facing difficulties in purchasing enough pre-set volumes. Due to competitive acquisition, prices have increased mutually. Fresh cocoon improved variety Sima scales in Hai'ning and other places have an average price of 3,000 yuan per load, which is higher than the standard cocoon price evaluated by the Ministry of Industry. Cocoon shops in various places in Jiangsu will open scales soon, and the silkworm season is reportedly better than in Zhejiang. As for silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing and other places, they will soon prepare to start work because spring cocoons have been launched on the market.</p>
<p>Wheat Loan</p>
<p>Wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has begun to enter the market. Due to the even distribution of rain, all places have reported a bumper harvest. Recently, each bank has agreed to provide as much wheat loan as possible. At the same time, Japanese banks have also agreed to provide loans for purchase. It is reported that the purchase and distribution of wheat will be handled by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee under the National Commercial Control Association. The association is an organization that unites Chinese and Japanese flour manufacturers and colleagues in the flour and wheat industry, and will purchase wheat in large quantities from the wheat production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The wheat obtained will be distributed to various factories for the production of flour. As for the price of wheat, it is evaluated by the competent authorities according to the agricultural cost and market price.</p>
<p>Dragon Boat Festival Holiday Decided</p>
<p>June 7 is the Dragon Boat Festival, and each industry will handle the settlement of accounts as usual. Recently, because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching soon, each factory, company, bank, and squid has begun to prepare, and all customer accounts that have been loaned out in the past will be urged for collection after being cleared separately. At the same time, funds due on Dragon Boat Festival for each bank will be transferred and returned by themselves. It is reported that each bank in the banking industry has now decided to take a holiday during the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize prices, eliminate the black market, and stabilize people's livelihood, the Nanjing Municipal Government has implemented the first step of the plan, actively rectifying the major commercial trade associations, and investigating the quantity of inventory stored in the city. Most of the trade associations have been rectified and are ready, and the first step of the plan can be completed as scheduled this month. Under the cooperation of the authorities and the trade associations, various goods have gradually become stable, and black market transactions have also been eliminated. It is expected that in the future, each industry and the price of goods will gradually be brought into the right track, and the lives of citizens can also be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Dynamic Trends of Various Trade Associations <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Brewing Industry: The Brewing Industry Association has been formally established, has started working, and is handling member registration. All stores and businesses operating the brewing industry in this urban area, whether self-made, selling, purchasing, or separately selling merchants, must join the association to maintain their business, with a deadline of the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Match Industry: The United Association of the Match Industry Trade Association, organized by local match factories and the cigarette, match, and soap candle industries in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, has been prepared and scheduled to hold an establishment conference on the 30th of this month at the association's office. At that time, each district association must send representatives to attend.</p>

<p>After the Commercial Control Association was transferred to the Executive Yuan, its autonomous organizational work is expected to accelerate its progress. Regarding the establishment of branch offices in other ports, the two places of Guangdong and Hubei will be ready soon. The establishment of branch offices in North China will be delayed due to special circumstances, but it is recognized that after the material exchange outline of North China and Central China is determined this year, the establishment of branch offices and the establishment of an autonomous control mechanism can also be promoted in parallel.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Commercial Control Association has decided to first set up offices in Nanjing and other major cities. In order to facilitate contact with the Executive Yuan and other relevant departments, the Nanjing office will be established first.</p>
<p>After the progress of this kind of organizational work, the Commercial Control Association can strengthen its guidance and control power over various important places, and at the same time, it can promote the establishment and strengthening of local trade associations.

<h3 id="e46">Apprentices in Modern Factories <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Tu</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a well-funded iron factory that prides itself on being modern. The factory director, supervisors, and other staff are all highly educated, some even holding doctoral or master's degrees. Therefore, the management methods here are innovative, supposedly scientific and rational. Under such a scientific and rational system, our apprentices' treatment is certainly different from that of ordinary old-fashioned, corrupt, and unscientific small factories.</p>
<p>Admittedly, we don't have to wash rice and vegetables, we don't have to hold the boss's baby, and we don't have to empty the accountant's chamber pot. But, besides that, what do we get? Let's take a look!</p>
<p>Our apprenticeship lasts three years, with room and board provided by the factory. In these difficult times, being able to have three meals a day and a place to sleep without worry is already fortunate, and of course, we shouldn't ask for more. However, what we hope for is: (1) that what we receive is equal to the cost the factory pays, so that a few people don't profit in the middle, causing us to suffer even more. (2) Although we can't be too picky about the quality, cleanliness absolutely cannot be neglected. However, when we discover that the price of the meals doesn't match the food, or there are flies in the food, the administrative staff always defends the kitchen and threatens us with demerits or expulsion. Why is this?</p>
<p>Apprentices in old-style shops or factories receive a reasonable monthly allowance. We have the same, generally between ten and twenty yuan, depending on the length of service and diligence, but the name is different; it's specifically called "Attendance Subsidy." As the name suggests, this subsidy is only given for attending work. If you take leave, it must be deducted according to the number of days. Although this ten or so yuan isn't enough for a capitalist's cigarette or a cup of wine, the managers never overlook it, which shows their shrewdness.</p>
<p>Deducting the subsidy for leave is not enough to show their strictness, so it is also stipulated that one day of leave must be made up with two days of work. For leave of three days or more, the guarantor must take the apprentice out of the factory. This really makes us afraid to even think about taking leave.</p>
<p>After the three-year apprenticeship is completed, according to the rules of old-style commerce and industry, you would be promoted to clerk or worker. But in our factory, there's a new twist: you must serve for three years, and all benefits during the service period are lower than those of other regular workers. If you quit voluntarily before the term is up or are dismissed, you must repay the factory for all room, board, and subsidies enjoyed in the past. This is called compensating for losses.</p>
<p>Here are my recent expenses, published as follows: Haircuts cost five yuan each, three haircuts in February, averaging seven and a half yuan per month; bathing costs five yuan each, twice a month, totaling ten yuan; one bar of laundry soap costs twelve yuan per month; toothpaste, toothbrush, and towel average five yuan per month. These items alone cost nearly forty yuan, which is not enough even if the attendance subsidy is not deducted. What about the cost of shoes, socks, work clothes, and inner shirts and trousers, which are major expenses?</p>

<h3 id="e47">On the Cotton Cloth Problem <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is a necessity for people's clothing. In wartime, accurate supply and demand statistics are even more necessary.</p>
<p>For several months, the authorities' principles for dealing with cotton cloth have been roughly two points: (1) Preserve existing resources. (Restrict the movement of cotton cloth.) (2) Lower prices. (Announce price limits for cotton cloth.) But reviewing the implementation of various measures, it seems to be close to passive prevention, so a comprehensive plan is needed.</p>
<p>The reasons for the sharp rise in cotton cloth prices are roughly as follows: The first surge was due to the panic of the New and Old Currency Exchange last year, but it quickly gradually returned to a lower level. This year's surge was due to (1) reduced production by spinning mills; (2) the impact of unfounded rumors of a 2:1 exchange of Joint Reserve Notes and Savings Certificates for new currency this spring, and the recall of military notes; (3) outsiders taking the opportunity to enter the market; and (4) the authorities restricting the movement of spot goods and prohibiting the sale of warehouse receipts, causing merchants holding goods to fear violating the law and to remain on the sidelines, resulting in a reduction in the amount of goods circulating on the market, supply falling short of demand, and every transaction exceeding the price limit, becoming an open secret.</p>
<p>However, according to the recent announcement by the National Commercial Control Federation, the inventory of cotton yarn and cloth in this city is extremely sufficient, enough to supply consumption for a considerable number of months. Therefore, today, for the overall problem of dealing with cotton cloth, emphasis should be placed on a comprehensive plan for the allocation of both inventory and consumption. (1) Request the authorities to announce the inventory of cotton cloth in this city (convert yarn reserves into cloth) and reserve it for several years of needs. (2) Adjust the established price limits. It is necessary to review whether the established price limits are appropriate. However, the price limits after adjustment, such as after a new announcement, must be decisive. The registered inventory should never be changed, in order to eliminate the idea of speculation and hoarding. (3) The Cotton Products Federation or the Cotton Cloth Guild should, according to the needs period announced by the authorities, accept the items and quantities requested by the demand side on a monthly basis in proportion (including retail merchants in this city and other cities, and the amount of foreign exports), and purchase and allocate them from inventory holders at the price limit. The purchase method may still allow free negotiation between buyers and sellers, but the payment of the goods must be made after the negotiation is completed, first by the demand side submitting it to the Cotton Products Federation or the Cotton Cloth Guild, and then paying it to the seller for delivery, in order to eliminate the trend of exceeding the price limit (limited to the actual allocation of spot goods). If the holder of the goods hoards and refuses to sell, the guild may order the purchase. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Long Er</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Three years of apprentice life have passed by emptying chamber pots, sweeping floors, opening and closing shop doors, and carrying bolts of cloth. But the boss has no intention of hiring another apprentice, and still only gives me ten yuan a month for spending money. Now it costs two yuan to get a haircut, what can I do?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Zhang, who came a month earlier than me, went to ask the boss about the salary issue. The boss turned red in the face and said to him: If you don't want to work here, you can go somewhere else.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>I went home to see my mother at dusk. The five yuan I gave her the day before yesterday is already used up. Alas! The cost of living is soaring every day: last year, five yuan could last four or five days!</p>
<p>In the crimson twilight, it feels very cold. It's not the time to wear a lined shirt, but there are already seven or eight holes in my cotton robe. This spring, the boss widened his eyes and said to me: "Those who eat in a silk and satin shop must dress nicely!"</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I am very worried. I am not worried about my hunchbacked mother, but about my young sister, who is also sixteen years old! Will she fall because of the environment? Will she be deceived?</p>
<p>I also thought about the few dilapidated houses passed down from our ancestors. When my father was alive, he had already sold a row of buildings to the Jin family. This time, my mother told me that the Jin family is preparing to buy the remaining few houses outside at a high price. Should we sell them, or not? "Of course not!" I thought firmly. But my mother has repeatedly borrowed more than one hundred yuan from the Jin family. Where can we get the money to pay it back? Ah, don't people even have the right to live in a few dilapidated houses?</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Today, while eating, the boss scolded me fiercely, saying that I was not attentive to customers, that I always had a straight face, and that there was not a trace of a smile, and that customers didn't come to see my face. Alas, God, I am not putting on airs and selling smiles like a prostitute who has lost her soul. Why should I pretend to smile to cater to people? Besides, I was just daydreaming a bit, and was a little less attentive. I was thinking about my house, my mother, my sister!</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>"Hee hee, the price is the cheapest, you can rest assured."</p>
<p>"This pattern is the most fashionable, and the color is also very good. Hee hee"</p>
<p>I am always smiling like this in a series.</p>
<p>"Hee hee" seems like the teeth of a beast, and it is about to devour my youth.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Zhang has been recommended to a factory in Shanghai by his uncle. He has left this sea of suffering. When will I be able to escape this hateful situation?</p>
<p>The boss is suffering from a very serious typhoid fever. I am very happy. It is certain that those with a lot of wealth are weak in body, five thousand yuan of capital, and it has changed to seven hundred thousand.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>Today, taking advantage of the boss's illness, I went home again. Coincidentally, my sister wanted to come and find me, wanting me to sign a deed to sell the house. Alas, Heaven knows, how can my trembling hand sign it? The house passed down from our ancestors, how dare I sell it? I put down the pen and rejected my sister's request.</p>
<p>Silvery-white earthworms crawled down from the corners of my mother's eyes, and my face also seemed to be a little itchy, and my chest was also wet.</p>
<p>[Long Er... You know, right? It's not that I'm heartless... I must sell it. What will life be like in the future... We owe the Jin family so much money, and we often borrow from your uncle's place...] My mother continued to say: [When your father died, he only left us fifty yuan and three dilapidated houses...]</p>
<p>[Mom, I know, too. Where will we live if we sell them?]</p>
<p>[In the countryside, at your uncle's place.]</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>In the morning, my mother and sister set off for the countryside together. The only property passed down from our ancestors was sold for only four hundred yuan. Alas, how long can the four hundred yuan last after deducting the old debts? What will we do when it's used up? Ah, ah, I dare not think about it.</p>
<p>From now on, I am the loneliest child. I have no sympathy or comfort, only coldness and disdain are cast upon me. The future is also vast and I am afraid that I will only be an apprentice for the rest of my life, being yelled at by people.</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>The boss has recovered from his illness, only sick for a month and a half.</p>
<p>Very serious damp-heat typhoid fever; if my mother had it, I am afraid she would be in the ground by now. I hope I can pray to Heaven to give blessings to my mother, so that she will not be uneasy and sick.</p>
<p>Received a letter from my mother, which made me miss her even more.</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>In the early morning, when opening the shop door, my limbs were frozen stiff, and I put on the tattered cotton robe without regard for anything.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the young boss came to see the boss. He was wearing a neat thick velvet suit. I looked in the mirror. He was no more blessed than me, and his features were about the same as mine.</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>In the afternoon, two young customers came, a man and a woman. The boss personally traded with them, and bought several pieces of woolen fabric, worth more than five thousand. When paying, there were two ten-yuan bills, which the boss said were fake, because the printing was relatively blurry. The two insisted on not exchanging them. The boss was uneasy and asked me to take them to the department store across the street to ask.</p>
<p>Where did the fake bills come from at this time? The boss likes to nitpick. The manager sitting in the department store said they were good to use. I returned to the shop and told the boss and customers what the shop assistant said. The boss blushed, admitted his mistake, and apologized.</p>
<p>After the customers left, the boss grabbed the copper ruler on the table and chopped it over. I quickly dodged to the side, raised my right foot again, and kicked towards my stomach. At this time, I could explode. I have freedom. Although I eat his food, I also work for him. After all, I am not his slave.</p>
<p>I raised my left hand, clenched my right fist, and punched him in the chest. He fell and tumbled.</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>I left. I live in a small almshouse, and I feel like a cat. Although I have broken with my master, where is my home, and where can I find food?</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the old cat croaked strangely, pulling up my memories. My mother often said to me: Long Er, you must be patient! A young man must be patient, and only with patience can he have food to eat.</p>
<p>However, how can I endure any longer? I want freedom! I have never been a slavish flatterer in my life, which is the most disadvantageous thing. If I could flatter, people would look at me differently, and there would be no need to be patient or not. In short, I lack a valuable heart to flatter.</p>

<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>—What does it matter if a few people die! There are plenty of living people!</p>
<p>"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"</p>
<p>When a weak and trembling voice vibrated in my ear, I habitually looked up and saw a female worker standing beside my typewriter. On her bloodless face, the two dull eyes revealed a powerless and desperate light, looking at me with a plea for help. Seeing it, I was a little scared, it would remind me of the eyes of a dying person.</p>
<p>"Okay! You can take a rest!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!" These three weak, feeble words burst out from the opening and closing of her slightly trembling grayish-white lips.</p>
<p>Then, she dragged her heavy steps away. I silently watched her thin back, and I began to feel sad for the fate of this poor person.</p>
<p>In the past few years, several times, several unfortunate people, after this situation, have disappeared forever.</p>
<p>When some people bring their "news of death," my heart always feels a violent tremor.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"</p>
<p>That powerless, weak, trembling... voice floated in my ear again, that bloodless face, the desperate and pleading light in the dull eyes, flashed in front of me again.</p>
<p>"Ah! Poor people!" I felt that there was a kind of wet liquid rolling in my eyes.</p>
<p>After that, the empty positions they left behind in the factory were immediately and easily filled by those newly arrived substitutes.</p>
<p>When I passed in front of those substitutes, I often focused my gaze on their faces. What I saw were all faces full of vitality. I was a little lost. The faces of those poor dead people flickered in front of me again. I will never forget their desperate and pleading eyes. I remember, when they first entered the factory, weren't they all the same as these energetic people? But, after the machines have absorbed their vitality, they have become rich sacrifices in front of the god of death.</p>
<p>Is it? Who can say for sure that these new substitutes will not fall into the same fate?</p>
<p>In this labor circle, the news of the death of some workers is something that everyone feels indifferent to. It is nothing more than providing some living people with some oral talking material. Yes! Who would really care about the decline of a weak life that has nothing to do with them!</p>
<p>The unfortunate news of death, at first, among the living, will still be hotly discussed, or criticize the deceased's strengths and weaknesses. Of course, these deceased people, during their lifetime, were just people who sold their labor. Therefore, in fact, they will not have any meritorious deeds, virtues, or words... and other words and deeds or movements to inherit to future generations, nor will they be like the great men who established great careers, who can leave people with an immortal impression. Therefore, soon, everyone will forget about this matter.</p>
<p>Every day, the looms, yarn spindles, still roar dully without stopping, every worker is still burying their heads, bending their waists, and using their thin hands to control those ignorant, cold and rigid machines. Who will ever go back to memory to find out the past traces—the news of death!</p>
<p>I also remembered a sentence said by a senior employee in this labor circle who is good at saying cold words: "What does it matter if a few people die! There are plenty of living people!"</p>
<p>Yes! The dead have certainly died quietly, but there are plenty of living people! Isn't it? Every day, how many living people are struggling on the line of death, using their blood and flesh to contend with life, forcibly supporting their weak bodies, and only a few remaining strength, squirming and toiling, ah! Those poor, many, living people!</p>
<p>"Mr. Ling! My body is not well! Please give me a few days off!"</p>
<p>This powerless, slightly trembling voice will always vibrate in my ear again! I am thinking.</p>

<p>After drinking a bowl of thin congee in the morning and going out with his uncle, Shen Xiaogen didn't rest his feet at all. In the afternoon, he came back with two extra dou of rice on his back. After circling a few times in the concession, he dragged his exhausted body back home.</p>
<p>"Go take a nap!" "Don't go to school today," his mother said as she picked up the rice sack, using a loving tone towards Xiaogen.</p>
<p>He certainly needed to sleep for a while, but he remembered that he had to go to school. Mr. Shi had said last week that there would be a writing competition today! ——— Yes! That's right, it's Thursday!</p>
<p>Thinking of the writing competition, Xiaogen immediately thought of the dense diagrams and "A" grades in his writing book. Mr. Shi had said:</p>
<p>"Shen Xiaogen has hope!"</p>
<p>So he struggled to get out of bed. He had to go to school! Besides, he was the class leader, and class leaders shouldn't be absent from class under any circumstances!</p>
<p>"I told you to take a nap, but you never listen! What are you getting up for?" His mother's voice rang from the corner of the room.</p>
<p>"I—I want to go to school!" Xiaogen said softly.</p>
<p>"You're courting death!" His mother got angry: "You've been running all day, and you still want to go to school?!"</p>
<p>"There's a writing competition today."</p>
<p>"Writing competition? — No matter what competition it is, it's not okay. Let me ask you: Do you want to live? Tomorrow I'm planning to talk to the teacher and tell him not to let you study anymore. Go earn some money with your uncle every day. Your father has been sick for more than ten days..."</p>
<p>"Don't study?" Xiaogen was shocked: "Mom! ...That's not possible! ...I've only been studying for a little over half a year..."</p>
<p>"This is your uncle's idea!" His mother still loved her son: "I still have to discuss it with your father... but you can't go today! ...You've run dozens of miles,... and it's too late to go anyway! It's already past six o'clock... the sun has already set..."</p>
<p>Xiaogen climbed onto the bed in despair.</p>
<p>What kind of topic will Mr. Shi give? ...They've probably already finished writing it, right? ...Who will finish first? ...Chen Meiying will definitely get first place this time! ...</p>
<p>"Ah—...yah—..."</p>
<p>He didn't know that this was his father. Looking at his father's pale face and his thin, reed-like body covered with a thin quilt, Xiaogen had a series of memories. Since the factory closed down, his father had never had a good life. First, he worked as a temporary laborer at the pier with Uncle Feng, then he started doing small business, setting up a stall; later, he carried Du rice with his uncle, running back and forth two or three times a day...</p>
<p>That's how he ruined his health, constantly coughing, sometimes even spitting up blood...</p>
<p>"Can't you rest for a few days?" His mother often complained like this.</p>
<p>"Rest for a few days?" His father always replied like this: "You always have such a pampered nature. Rest for a few days, what will we eat? Eat milk? Or ginseng and bird's nest?"</p>
<p>"Your health is not good!" His mother grumbled.</p>
<p>"I know," his father lowered his head: "But what can I do? ...Knowing that my body is not good, I still have to keep going! ...My... my life is over! Xiaogen... must live well! ...Study more! ...Fight for success! ..."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, Xiaogen's tears flowed down.</p>
<p>In the evening, his uncle came.</p>
<p>Seeing his uncle, Xiaogen felt half gratitude and half resentment.</p>
<p>"How is Xiaogen's father?" His uncle sat down at the table; "What I earned today should be enough for a dose of medicine!"</p>
<p>"The medicine has been taken!" His mother answered softly: "But there's not enough money to buy household rice! ..."</p>
<p>"Go earlier tomorrow and make more trips!"</p>
<p>"Let him rest for a day tomorrow!" His mother raised her head: "He was terribly exhausted today and didn't go to school either!"</p>
<p>"He's still a child after all! Not very useful!" His uncle shook his head: "But, he needs to practice next time! ...Hard days are ahead! ...However, I say, sister, if you really rely on him to take over his father's path,... then there's simply no need to go to school anymore! ...What's the use of studying? ..."</p>
<p>"No! Uncle!" Xiaogen cried out? "I... I want to study! I've only been studying for a little over half a year... Mr. Shi said..."</p>
<p>But thunder rumbled from the side of the table:</p>
<p>"Do you want to live? Do you want to support your father and mother?"</p>
<p>Xiaogen burst into tears on the table.</p>
<p>"Xiaogen! Listen to Mom!" His mother walked over: "Just listen to your uncle! Don't go to school starting tomorrow! Tell the teacher at school,... when Dad has money, we'll let you study again: ...Don't even go to the free night classes! ...Go to a good school, go to university! ..."</p>
<p>Xiaogen sobbed, stubbornly shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Good! That's settled!" His uncle stood up: "I say Xiaogen is not a muddled-headed child. ...He's very sensible and will understand Mom's meaning... I'll let you rest for one day tomorrow, and I'll come again tomorrow night!"</p>
<p>His uncle left.</p>
<p>Xiaogen sobbed.</p>
<p>His mother also sobbed.</p>
<p>Outside, the rain was also sobbing.</p>
<p>That morning, the rain had been falling continuously, drizzling and drizzling.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the rain was lighter, and he went to school.</p>
<p>Luo Baokang, Big Head, Shi Rongde, they were all playing at the school gate.</p>
<p>"Oh! Shen Xiaogen is here! — Hey! Where's your schoolbag?"</p>
<p>"Shen Xiaogen! Why aren't you talking?"</p>
<p>"Hey! Why don't you say a word? Putting on airs?"</p>
<p>"Shen Xiaogen! Have you become mute?"</p>
<p>"Did you quarrel with someone!"</p>
<p>Xiaogen lowered his head and walked into the school gate without saying a word, followed by a large group of classmates.</p>
<p>"Shen Xiaogen—why didn't you come?" Mr. Shi was grading papers.</p>
<p>"He went to carry rice!" Big Head rushed to answer! "Luo Shikang went to his house!"</p>
<p>"Carry rice?" Mr. Shi said in disbelief! "Where are the adults in your family?"</p>
<p>"Dad is sick,... he's been sleeping for more than ten days... he hasn't had a dose of medicine! ...And there's no money to buy household rice..."</p>
<p>"How much can you earn in a day?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday..." Xiaogen shook his head! "Yesterday... I ran all day,... and it was only enough for one dose of medicine! ...But, Dad... is still the same today! ..."</p>
<p>Mr. Shi didn't respond. Xiaogen heard him sighing softly.</p>
<p>The classmates all held their breath, widened their eyes, and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi! ..." Xiaogen finally mustered his courage; "...Mom said... I have to go... carry rice every day from now on, so... I... I... I won't study anymore! ..."</p>
<p>Mr. Shi was silent, as if he had known it for a long time.</p>
<p>Luo Baokang, Big Head, Shi Rongde, and many other classmates were also silent, without a single sound.</p>
<p>Everyone felt like a big stone was pressing on their hearts...</p>
<p>"Dong dong! Dong dong! Dong dong! ..." The bell rang familiarly.</p>
<p>The classmates reluctantly walked out of the office one by one.</p>
<p>"Shen Xiaogen! Come play often in the future!" Big Head was the last to leave.</p>
<p>Xiaogen raised his sleeve and slowly wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't be sad!" Mr. Shi's voice also changed: "...Haven't I told you many times before? ...The childhood of truly great people is not spent in school! ...You are very smart and very hardworking! ...You have a lot of hope! ...Come and ask me whenever you have time!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi! You're so..." Xiaogen raised his tear-stained face.</p>
<p>"I know your difficulties!" Mr. Shi nodded: "But this is something that can't be helped. Come back when your dad gets better!"</p>
<p>"I... I'm leaving! ..." He remembered that his mother would tell him to go back early.</p>
<p>He hesitated and lifted his feet. In the classroom next door—in that familiar classroom, Mr. He was teaching arithmetic as usual, and the classmates were still sitting quietly as usual, listening, and after a while, they would still do problems as usual and get out of class as usual... But,...</p>
<p>Walking out of the school gate, his tears flowed again.</p>
<p>He remembered how happy he was last autumn when his father came back from outside and told him that he had seen an advertisement for a free night school on a utility pole and told him to sign up. He had finally stepped into the gate of the school! ...Even his father and mother often told people! "Xiaogen is in school now!" ...</p>
<p>He also remembered how the classmates had elected him as class leader because of his good grades—even though he was the youngest in the class! ...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Finally, he arrived home.</p>
<p>"Xiaogen's father! ...Xiaogen's father! ...Wake up! ...You... you..." His mother knelt in front of the bed and called out urgently.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt a burst of inexplicable terror. His body trembled violently, and he ran to the bed in a panic.</p>
<p>His father was still like that, lying quietly on the bed, his pale face covered with soybean-sized beads of sweat, his eyes closed, his cheekbones protruding high, and his hair like a tangled pile of weeds...</p>
<p>"Xiaogen's father! ..." His mother finally sobbed.</p>
<p>His father's eyes opened, his weak gaze slowly swept around, and he shook his head with great effort, intermittently:</p>
<p>"...I... I... can't... do... it... anymore... Xiaogen... must... live... well! ...Study... more... ..."</p>
<p>...</p>
