<p>社評</p>
<h3>期待於上海糧食新機構</h3>
<p>昨天我們申論政治責任問題，曾列舉最近辦理糧政的失敗，指出賣任所在。認爲這樣重大的民生政事，絕小能不負責任，視同兒戲，如果今天對甲不究責任，不明賞罰；明天焉能課乙以責任，使之警惕是非而期以辦理完善？目前關於米糧採購配給事宜，改設米糧統制委員會辦理，是則新機構即將成立，開始工作，我們對此次新機構的期待，實校以往歷次尤爲殷切！</p>
<p>我們爲什麼對於糧食問題，不辭厭煩的一再討論呢？理由很簡單的，因爲糧食問題，就是大衆生活的問題；糧價問題，關係一般物價的問題。問題得到了合理解決，大衆生活就得到了大部分的安定；反之，這問題如果畸形發展，大衆生活就越發的挨痛受苦。這些絕非理論，完全事實，相信每個人都懂得的常　。我們輿論界的天職，旣然爲民喉舌，對這最關民生的糧食問題，自然不容放棄批評　議的責任。所以屢次迫切呼籲的意義，就在乎此。</p>
<p>古人云：「前事不忘，後事之師」。又云：「前車之覆，後車之鑑」。我們期待新機構辦理完善，必須檢討舊機構辦理失敗的原因，硏究其　結所在，決定改善方策。我們考察舊機構的失敗原因，旣不在機構本身的不靈敏，不完備；也非法令的不完善，不嚴密。而其　結，厥爲一部分不良份子的爲非作歹，藉公肥私，誠如我們昨天指出令人髮指的情形。所以，我們可以肯定的說，舊機構辦理失敗的　結，不在組織與法令，而全在於人事的不良。</p>
<p>我們旣然明白人事不良，是過去辦理糧政失敗的癥結，就盼望現在新機構對此特別注意。同時，我們願進一步　議如次：</p>
<p>新機構的主持人物，固然需要絕對的公正廉潔，明決果斷。可是，中級幹部與下級幹部，尤其需要忠實奉公，每個職員都須瞭解參加糧政機關辦事，是爲大衆服務，調整民食，幷非營商圖利。當全國商業統制總會成文之初，理事長對職員訓話，特別以「公正廉明」四字　為服務信條。現在管理　　新機構也屬於商統會系統之內，我們更希望澈底的遵守信條。主持人尤須認淸中下級幹部人事的重要，爲糧政前途着眼，登用人員，絕對公開，絕不任用私人，同時，社會各界人士也應認淸糧政機構的嚴肅性與重要性，切勿隨便推　，誤事誤人。最好採用考試甄別制度，嚴格選擇，至低限度也應山高級幹部組織甄選委員會，邀約社會公正人士與專家參加，職員均經過個別口試，共同決定錄用與否，務使不良份子絕無插足機會。我們相信政府內舊機構辦理不善而改組新機構，遴選主持人物，責望之殷，可以想見，而人民久苦糧政之　收，對此新機構新人物，期待夕切，更爲顯明。而受此新機構主持任務者，也常瞭然於各方期待，亟謀一新面目。人事問題，宵爲今後成敗之主要關鍵，新機構應首先反省者一。</p>
<p>人事基礎確定以後，米糧之採購運轉等事，自易走上軌道。配給數量必須逐漸增加，以至最低限度的足額，絕對不應再有減量，致失大衆信仰，重蹈舊機構的覆轍。至於運輸問題，尤當不辭唇舌，不避艱阻，據理交涉，寗以去就力爭，不爲推諉卸責，這是新機構應注意者二。</p>
<p>配給日期之長短，與配給數量有相輔關係，如配給數量勉強維持，而配給日期予以延長，上與配給減量無殊。因此，配給日期能縮短，而不可延長。</p>
<p>配給成分，必須明白規定，嚴格執行，公吿中應切實標明白米多少，紅米多少，碎米多少，而不可引用「或」字。因「或」字含糊模棱，無異予經手者以舞弊之機會。舉例言之，如公告中稱「白米一升或碎米一升」，結果領得者必定完全碎米，決無白米可得。經手者利用「或」字爲口實，對於領米戶口振振有詞，配給碎米。另將白米以黑市出售圖利。一方面窺知所謂「杜米階級」不吃碎米的心理，復以低價收買，更番出售，偷天換日。爲期消滅此種取巧舞弊，切實規定售米種類，不使稍有含混。</p>
<p>對於生產機關之工廠工人，勞動階級，敎育界等，配紛量似應特予增加，或另予特種配給。</p>
<p>最後，我們强調指陳，對於管理機構的一再變更，終是消極的辦法。惟有更新人事，課以責任，嚴明賞罰，才是積極的，克收成效的辦法。民食問題的合理調整，實已至刻不容緩的階段了，願政府當局與上海糧食新機構亟起圖之！</p>

<h3>糧食部當局解答糧食問題公米價可望減低</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　中央社記者於三日往訪糧食部常局，承對訪者所提出當前問題，分別予以答復，其內容大要如下：（問）新穀業已登塲，公　米價能否希望减低？（答）査本部配給米糧，向負統籌之責，無論米價貴　，收購未　一日停頓，配給價格即不能小兼顧成本，而使國庫限制增加負責，市上所售公米，係八月份上旬所撥，因原來進價正在高峯，故改　爲每石七百元。但按照成本計算，每石尙虧耗二百餘元。所有八九月配給公　之米，均係以前所存之陳糧，至新米本部尙未大量　時，亦未加入配給，　新　　經上市，價格尚非正常，如來源　　，收價自能見平，屆時公　價格，當然隨之調整，至配給偶然　期，實因辦理種種手續。或者未能充分圓滑，但己由各有關機關，切實調整，在本部向來按期配撥，並未間斷也。（問、木年北方食糧問題嚴重，故有南方米麥北運，以資調而，惟北運數量有無一定限度？（答）査南方米麥運濟北方民食，均有一定限度，每次先經問定數量，分別起運。</p>

<h3>靑木大臣　昨抵奉天</h3>
<p>奉天三日中央社電日靑木大東亞相於三日下午三時由哈爾濱抵此，當即在滿洲鐵道公司奉天本部召集滿鐵公司職員訓話，晚六時應滿鐵公司小日山總　歡宴。</p>
<h3>日美定下月　再交換僑民</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　華盛頓官方昨宣布：瑞典郵船格里蒲斯霍姆號，昨自咩駛赴印度西海岸葡萄牙殖民地果阿，以與日本換僑船作第一次交換僑民及貨物，預計交換將在十月中舉行，該船載有日俘一，三三〇人，並將停靠里約熱內盧及蒙得維多接載日僑民一七三人，中途並將至雨菲之伊利薩怕港　載燃料及水。日本至印度途程較近，故日本換僑船將於九月十五日出發，沿途停靠中國，菲律賓及越南海港，接戰反軸心國僑民，計約運載美僑約一，二五〇人，其他西僑約二五〇人至果阿。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹成為　歐洲堅強堡壘　反軸心企圖侵犯不可能</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　波爾森報於其論文中，討論侵入巴爾幹之問題，該處已成歐洲堡壘最堅强之據點。而德國工人已使該堡壘成爲不可侵犯之金城，德國與羅馬尼亞·克羅地·斯洛伐克·匈牙利等國合作，故必能堅守。敵軍之侵入該地之門戶有四。其一乃貝　拉比亞之門戶，現已關閉；其一韃靼尼爾爲土耳其所固守，而士國現正處於嚴正之中立；第三路更南方面因有羣島之保護，故欲自薩洛尼加之侵入實不可能；第四路奧蘭吐海峽亦不可通，海岸地帶在德軍堅守之中；故反軸心國實無路可得以進入巴爾幹半島。其自四面之侵入，則非佔領大部份之義大利不可『反軸心國或有軍隊空軍以及船舶，足供侵入東南歐之用，但實現此項侵入，比侵四四里島更爲困難，因距離較大及可資登陸地點者不多，若利用當地居民，但巴爾幹之民衆乃擁護歐洲者，游擊隊之力量已無足重要，聯合一致之力量乃不可敵者。</p>
<h3>反軸心軍渡海峽　在義本土登陸　德軍當局保緘默</h3>

<p>柏林三日中央社電　此問軍事當　對於所傳英軍在義南部登陸事，保持　端沉默。據悉英軍登陸者約有一師團之衆、『至於是否尙有英軍繼續登陸，目前尙方得悉。登陸地點係在加拉布里亞沿岸之勒格俄，義軍曾與登陸部隊激戰，至於德軍是否加入戰事尙未能確定。</p>
<p>畢薩古都三度被炸</p>
<p>羅馬三日中央社電　反軸心軍空軍曾於三十一日三度轟炸義國歷史古都畢薩，該市經三十分鐘轟炸後，繁　街道之建築物殆全被毀滅，市民傷亡頗重，惟總數不詳、按爲一人口六萬餘人之古都，馳名世界之彼斯塔即在市內。</p>

<h3>土政府下週開會　政策將有所決定</h3>
<p>安加拉三日中央社電　海通訊：伊斯美總統昨日返抵此間，較之政界及外交蜀所預期為早。土政府巳定於下星期舉行重要會議，討論主題將爲國　事務，預期土政府對於政策將有所決定。</p>
<p>安加拉三日中央社電　海通社訊：此間英美兩國大使，頃以奎貝克談話內容之涉及土耳其者，咨照土耳其外交部，惟此訊尙未經官方證實。</p>
<p>安加拉三日中央社電　土耳其政府對於英美政府要求勿收容政治逃　客之牒文，業已答覆覆　內容尙未宣布，但相信其係根據國際公法。</p>
<h3>郭培爾論稱　德團結益堅　必可獲致勝利</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾於戰爭爆發紀念日在最近一期「德國週刋」發表一文稱：德國人民及其領袖不能担負此次戰爭之責任，德國乃被迫而出此，吾人之意向皆在和平範圍之內，　之敵人在此次戰爭前絕無內政上之困難，德國今在各方面團結益堅，德國之地位亦較戰爭爆發時爲優，此皆元首之優秀戰略有以致之。吾人今日決不致因缺乏食物或其他物資而陷於死地，吾人今已具備必勝之條件、戰爭變化多端，發展雖有波折，但有利局勢終必屬於吾人。吾人乃代表新時代之理想，敵人乃舊意識之代表，敵人實欲重演凡爾賽之錯誤，甚至欲變本加厲，吾人則欲加以糾正之，職是之故，最近數週英·美人民　戰爭之繼續進行已生懷疑。敵人所施之恐怖空襲，今亦未收成效，敵人已一誤再誤，其一舉一動適足增强吾人作戰之意志，故勝利必屬於吾人。</p>
<h3>丹駐瑞公使　發表聲明</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　丹麥駐瑞典公使館二日發表聲明稱，本公使節鑒於本國情勢已趨緊張，故決定與本國政府脫離，宣告自由。</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾昨竟日會談調整對蘇關係為主題</h3>
<p>里斯木三日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：羅斯福總統昨日與邱吉爾首相在白宮會談幾達終日，據信所談者為英美與蘇聯之關係，尤其是關於蘇聯對反軸心軍事常局在西西里之行動之批評，該消息承認英美與蘇聯之間，曾有政治上齟齬，英美領袖現方設法消弭之。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電　據華盛頓來電：傳邱吉爾抵華盛頓後曾會見美軍參謀總長馬歇爾，邱氏在奎貝克之演說中，曾屢就英美蘇三國之關係加以說明，美英兩國言論一界亦力蘇三國關係有加以調整之必要。美通報曾論三國會談困難之理由，謂三國調整關係，除在歐洲　蘇聯　步外，別無他途，與其提倡永久之和平，或企求集團之安全，莫如探討英美兩國與蘇聯在歐洲及東亞之利益的共同點，三國間如能事前締結協定，則尙能召開會談，否則企圖於會談中調整三國關係實屬錯誤。</p>
<h3>霍浦金觀測戰局　需兩年結束</h3>

<p>蘇聯要求</p>
<h3>以英國為基地　十週內進攻歐陸</h3>
<p>蘇聯的新聞雜誌，最近又熱烈地開始討論第二戰綫問題。反軸心軍的對德第二戰綫，應在何時何地開始，蘇聯方而的見解，漸趨明瞭。最近一期的「戰爭與勞働階級雜誌，明白地聲稱第二戰綫應在本年中開闢成功。二十本日的眞理報稱：「從英國的經濟情勢及戰略的地位來看，英國是進攻歐洲最好的立脚點。以英國爲根據進攻歐洲大陸，祇要突破三十三公里的英法海峽就夠了，」</p>
<p>蘇聯的理由</p>
<p>蘇聯主張必須在本年內開闢第二戰綫的理由，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>因東戰綫蘇軍攻勢的進展及軸心軍的撤退西西里，目前的國際情勢，正是開闢第二戰綫的絕好機會。</p>
<p>蘇軍抵抗德軍的全部壓力，不暇休息地展開着對德大戰，第二戰綫的延期開闢，加重蘇軍的負擔。</p>
<p>第二戰錢的遲延，助成德軍防衛力的强化。</p>
<p>不久秋天就要到來，秋季的氣候不利於登陸戰，使登陸戰極感困難，對登陸戰有利的時期，祇　十星期了。</p>
<p>以英國為基地十週內進攻歐陸</p>
<p>從蘇聯報上所說的判斷起來，對於第二戰綫問題，英美的態度顯有不同。第一，關於開闢第二戰綫的時期，據最近一期的戰爭與勞働階級」稱，一部分英國的政治家，並不以爲那樣迫於眉睫緊急的問題，但蘇聯則以爲這正是極緊急的問題。</p>
<p>第二，關於開闢第二戰綫的地點，從反軸心軍最近的作戰方向來推測，似乎地中海有成爲主要戰塲的可能，但上述的眞理報紀載，則以爲以英本國爲基地進攻四歐，比地中海作戰可獲得更大的效果。該報指出在地中海作戰上，兵員的運輪與不補充，必需二十倍以上的船腹，因而主張進攻西歐。</p>
<p>今後發展可注目</p>
<p>奎貝克會談中，關於應在何時何地開始第二戰綫一事，顯然已展開了種種議論。蘇聯以深切的關心注視會議的前途，而等待其結果如何。可是在這重要的瞬間，蘇聯政府却更迭駐英美兩國大使，故極堪注目。（翔：　自八月二十五日東京　日新聞）</p>

<h3>商統會唐理事長　談收買棉紗布</h3>
<p>在不牴觸統制精神之範圍內為商民謀合法與正當之解決</p>
<p>（中央社　訊）全國商業統　總會奉令辦理收買棉紗棉布事宜，已另組辦事處，續極進行，九月六日爲申請截止之期，逾期須受法律處分，一方面聘請紗布業專家，担任査定貨賀之責，水社爲期明　收買過暨將來配給情形，特派記者趨訪商統會唐理事長　民叩詢一切，承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>收買決不展期切勿遲延自誤</p>
<p>此次本會事政府命令，收買棉紗棉布，已組織辦事處　理、關於查定貨質　，因恐非業外人所能鑑別審定，聘請紗布業中人担負查定之責。本會性質爲商業集體，對於商人合法利益，當　保　之責，並時以此爲宗旨。收買期限，政府命令至九月六日為止。不再寬展，本會認爲逾期未曾申請商民，須受法很處分，故一再通吿，千萬不可再存俸偉之心理，以爲如上次登記之可以一再補辦，則自誤　豫。</p>
<p>以後處理辦法當局早已說明</p>
<p>外間傳說，對於紗布收買後之處理發生懷疑，此事政府當局在滬時早　謂請紗布業領袖當而說明，收買後即將制定配給辦法公布施行，以供民間需要，如有搬出、亦必以物交換為原則。配給辦法、聞正在調查計劃，不日即可公佈施行。至以棉紗棉布爲製造原料之一廠配給，亦早經考景，惟必須先事調查成品存量及估計民間需要量後再行規定，方為妥善，否則成成品充斥、生產過剩，製造廠商必受虧損，本會站在商業集體立塲，固無時不為商　利書着想，但以職掌所在，亦戰能在不抵關統制精神節因內為商民　合法與正常之解決，過此即非木會所能為力，此點應為一股商界領袖所共諒。</p>
<p>價款一次付給其勢絕不可能</p>
<p>再外間又　　到照政府規定收買　出之代價，現已與中儲銀行依據政府命令商討如何使　民便利。至如黃金交付，均由中儲主辦，當然可照政府規定一一照辦，似無顧慮之必要、又有一般議論，以為應付價款，以可一次付給紗布持有人者，此事與防止通貨惡性膨　關係非淺，為民生物價着想，其勞絕不可能。且自收買紗布辦法公布以後，截至現在爲止，亦尙無向本會作正式請求者，足見一般南人亦能深明此義也。</p>
<p>又訊，本市收買棉紗棉布辦事處業經成立，開始辦公，幷限期補行登記，至六日爲止。故水市各太小棉紗布莊號之另售商店，均已於本月一日起，一律停止出售布疋、整理存貨，以便據實　報，而符法令，本巿布廠榮同業公會，昨特發通吿云「凡持有本會會員染　織廠棧單者，應依照商統會收買棉紗布辦事處通告，　限申請收買。其尙未登記者，井應依限前往補行登記，申請收買。　收買辦事處發給之搬遝證連同各該廠發給之棧單，到廠出貨，自行途往指定他庫，并處理申請收買後之一切手續，茲為持單人及工廠　辦事便利起見，應請已登記及補行登記之持單人，就日持單至發出棧單之各廠接洽，免致貽誤。」紗號業同業公會，棉製品業同業聯合會等，亦均發通告，催告各該業會員，依眼申請出賣，以符法令，絕對不得意存觀望，以致愆期受罰，茍有規避等情事，一經行政院另行指定之查緝機關查獲，必當依法處分。</p>
<h3>八區轄境　無變更</h3>

<p>大佐居華亘十餘年，其間留滬時問最多。對於中國情形頗爲熱悉，促進中日報善最爲努力。性情和善，洵為「中國之友」。自擔任艦隊報道部長職務以後，又値大東亞　爭勃發，對於中國文化宣傳工作、竭盡愛護之責，促進中日協力共同作戰意義之指導宣揚，厥功殊　。</p>
<p>此外，就本報立塲，特別値行提出的，大佐是管理本報的指導者，對於本報過去歷史與特性，頗承尊重與雜護，因此得以充分發揮民間與論的性能，以及宣楊大東亞戰爭的意義，這種重視中國民間與論的　大意見，殊堪飮佩。</p>

<h3>日艦隊報道部長鎌田佐介紹松島部長對記者團致辭</h3>
<p>中央社　訊日駐華艦隊報道部長鎌田正一大佐，此次奉命調任，由松島慶三大佐擔任，兩報道部長，昨下午三時在陸　外三當局定例會議席上，招待本市中國各報社記者，除兩報道部長躬親出席外，並到鑒田中尉，坂爪囑托，大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，福間副領事等，席間由鎌田大佐介紹新報道部長松島大佐，網由松島氏致詞，至下午五時許始畢。</p>
<p>新任松島部長致詞</p>
<p>此次事命　駐華艦隊報道部長之重以繼鎌田大佐之後，得在諸位協力下從事決戰下之報道任務，殊覺欣幸。余德　才葬，且深感責任重大，唯決心努力，俾不辱前任官所建樹之赫赫功績。但余對當地情形生疏。又關於報道任務，殊少研究，尙望諸位不吝指敎協力，戰局已顯示愈益熾烈之決戰，太平洋方而戰鬥正益見自　化，我日本忠勇將士，日以繼夜在陸海空三方面擊滅頑敵，同時在大陸方面，對作戰　備及建設更題繁忙，在此期間中日兩國在鞏固團結之下，爲完遂大東亞聖戰繼新東亞民族而舉其總力，向同生共死擊滅英美之途邁巡。但今後更須澈底了解聖戰之大義，以東洋文化之眞價　碎敵軍暴戾之侵略，以求最後的勝利，而吾人負報道重任者，尤應　悟實任日重，不屈不撓，始終不渝，為吾人之信條，余希望與諸君以日本海軍之傳統精神，活躍報道戰綫，完成重任。」</p>
<p>松島大佐略歷</p>
<p>繼長艦隊報道部長之松島慶三大佐、亦爲中國通，才幹不亞於　田大佐。松島氏於昭和六年（民國二十年）畢業於海軍大學。昭和七年夏季至八年歲尾，任上海陸戰隊參謀。昭和十二年八月負宣傳使命，奉派至上海武官府。昭和十四年九月，任出雲艦副長，保衛揚子江，厥功尤偉。今次就任報道部長、已爲第五次蒞滬。松島大佐雖爲武人、亦長翰　，文名藉　，着有擋寫大東亞戰爭爆發後海　第一期作戰之「制海萬畢」等名著，頗博好評，洵爲允文允武之人材。</p>
<p>鎌田部長致離任辭</p>
<p>「命日　命轉任願玫一言，以資惜別，具有十餘年之關係，一日離別中國，實覺無限感情。回　余在任中最不能忘懷者，國民政府負起大東亞新秩序建設戰之一　，以堅定信念及熱忱而布告對英美宣戰。此爲空前的史之壯觀，余對毅然首先參加大東亞戰爭之國民政府，向內外外明其堅強意志及實行力，實爲中國欣幸。此係爲解開亞洲永達之共同運命，即欲加以抑制亦不可能之熱情的表現。而我日本，對亞洲並無何種如敵人所宣傳之野心，由於交琮租界而自明、更毋　辭　，然而英美用盡一切計謀，　動壟斷亞洲，鼓視此大東亞之合　的生存權之要求及發展姿態，在其族使下，　爲曲解大東亞共存共榮之之意的蔣政權，採取抗日政策，實爲　　於東亞間之矛盾。此矛盾不能不般法解決、署人率直希望重慶早日獲得大東亞的自覺。今日大東亞戰，由於歷史上空前之我方戰果，將菲島，東印度羣島，馬來，緬旬及其他太平洋諸島完全置於我制壓下，奠定確立所謂大東亞共榮圈之基礎，吾人　謂決戰將在於今日以後。是以國民政府為掃除英美之殘暴，到　建設束亞之共同目標，不能不覺悟尙有甚多之艱苦，際此離任之日，願促友邦中國　起。」</p>
<p>鎌田大佐略歷</p>
<p>鎌田大佐大正五年卒業於兵學校同年十二月以海軍少尉任用。昭和六年任上海特別陸戰隊副官　參謀，昭和九年任艦長之職，十三年任副長，十四年，任海軍大佐，被命爲駐汕頭武官。十五年十日、以上海在勤海軍武官輔佐官兼中國方面　隊參謀、兼上海海軍航路部部員、而特別盡力於稅關對策、上海港的改修。九月一日、以上海在勤海軍武官輔佐官兼中國方面艦隊參謀而任中國方面艦隊報道以來、擔任對內對外宣傳報道之聯，以至今日。大東亞戰　數日軍進駐租界後、即同時與實施部隊共同開始接收處理　往新聞社用通訊社，一面並擔任　文報紙的　成強化，違禁　音機的處理取締等、及　備中國的通信、指導與論界的　生、努力促成中日提携。</p>
<p>評言</p>
<h3>今後的商統會</h3>
<p>三憫月以前的全國商業統制總會，是在内部機構尙未完成的時代國今日的全國商業統制總會，非但是規模備具，並且是握有統制全權的時代了，—不但是全權辦理棉紗布收買配給的機構。同時也是管理糧食的機構。</p>
<p>以民衣民食國大問題萃於一身的商統食而言。則今後不談紗布與食糧配給問題則已，否則，是責無旁貸的。我們相信商統會必能重視其配給責任，一如數視其妝買責任，換一句話說，必能以處理收買之精神與力量，處理配給。同時，我們相信商統　於政府制定之配給辦法公布旋行後，　能時時以其執行配給的經過，公開於社會民衆。須知民衆之所以歡迎收買，莫非由於歡迎配給。</p>
<p>因此，我們切望今後的商統會，多多與新聞界發生密切之聯繫，以免眞情　於外聞。</p>
<h3>各業公會增設收買配給兩組統計所需量按等配給</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會、自本年四月份起、遵照關係當局命令，先後實行改組，除修正原有會章外，並改逐理監事，迄今主要各業公會已全部改組就緒，次要公會亦已十之七八改組　事，各公會負責人爲適應政府經濟政策起見，對於公會機構，力圖刷新，並與主管官署，取得密切連繫，期官商能充分合作。綜括各公會刷新機構後工作之重點，不外集中收買及配給，爲加强工作效力起見，各公會特設物資收買配給兩專組，　在目前戰時狀態下，物資能圓滑流通，以裕民生。</p>
<p>籲請當局　協助採辦</p>
<p>戰時物資之缺乏，原爲必然現象、但苟不設法補救，則人民日常生活所需之資料，易感不足，如是物優勢必狂漲。民生不　，各公會鑒於會員個別自仃採辦原料、不特困難重重，且運費亦頗浩大，故對於會員按月所需之物資，決予集巾收買，各公會已將共會員每月所用之各項物資，統計成表，擬（逐月按照此項基準，向各地產區大規模收買，爲使收買順利起見，不得不　請關係當局充分協助，各公會業已呈請主管官署，一方面正在調度資金，　派採辦員，及考慮運輸方法等。</p>
<p>蒐得物資　配予會員</p>
<p>原斜一日由公會集中見得後，卽全數按照收買價格，配予會員，但會員商店之規模有大小，每月所需原料亦不同，故公會將全體會員，分爲甲，乙，丙，丁，四級，按照等級比例配給，但會員一經配得物資，須全部充作正當用途，絕對不准私自出　，且該項物資之製成品，應遵照公會評價委員會所訂之限價，全部售予正當用戶，各公會鑒於物資配給實行後，如會員有舞弊情事，其影響市面，自不在小，故先展開信用調査，審核會員商店之歷史，以及其負責人之　望，道德等，然後再行決定其是否能享有配給權利。</p>

<h3>國人與國文</h3>
<p>— 芍生</p>
<p>「國文」，就是本國的文字，凡是有文化的國家，都有着它們的文字。國文既是水國的文字，那末，凡是本國的國民，都應通曉本國的文字，這是不用說的了。</p>
<p>但可惜的，我國的許多靑年，在「一切都是外國的好」這種心理支配下，對於生活上需要的東西，都非外國的貨物不用，因此，對於文字，也非外國的不行了。照他們的意思，以爲懂得了幾句外國文，是非常了不得的，可以拿來誇傲儕　的！而那　不懂外國文的人呢，也同樣有着羡慕崇拜的心理、而以自己不識外國文爲丢臉、爲可惜了！由於此等心理的支配、喝於是國文就被棄之如敝　了。我們並不反對學習外國文，而且爲了可以了解外國事物起見，學習外國文還是很必要的。我們只是反對那種盲目地崇拜外國文字、這簡直是一洋奴思想—、　　上的亡　　」！</p>
<p>另外　有一等人，他們雖然並不和上面所說那一種人同樣心理，但他們對於國文，仍然不曉得注意，尤其是文學校費的靑年。在上國文課時、每每要起厭　之感·常看到他們在這時候·偷　　其它閒　、或效宰予之　　·以圖混過這「討厭的功課」。碰到先生出　作文時。也往往　衍了事，不是亂抄一陣、就是隨使寫上幾字就算了。這種　慶，同樣是不行的。以前高等考試初試，「國文技術之平庸」和「思路不淸」，未始不是這種原因造成的惡果。</p>
<p>我們對於上面第一種人對國文的態度，只覺得「奴性太深」，此外別無話說。要是他們能夠幡然覺悟，未始非一大佳事。都是不了解國文對於他們的重要，所以有些謬誤心理。我們願意對他們貢獻一些意見。</p>
<p>我們就不說一國的國民都應通曉他們的文字吧，要講起國文的效用却是多方面的。不論你是喜歡那種學問，希望　那種人物。比方你是喜歡文學的、　　　　文學作家吧，那末，至少國文必須　得精通，方可寫出一手好作品，自然不用說了。你假使希望做個秘書或文文書也是如此、假使你　望做個翻譯家吧、那宋、除了得把外國文界　精　外、也須把國文　得同樣精熟，方可以翻得出像樣的東西，而做得嚴復　謂「信」，「雅」，「達」的地步，其餘如新聞記者的　述新聞文字，政治家的　述政治主張的文字，大律師的為常事人　造訴狀，科學家的　述　騐報告，醫生的開方子，會計師的　造審査報告，以及商業家的做廣告等等，在在都需要精明的國文程度，</p>
<p>總之，國文是每個國人都須熟習的，決不容忽視。要是以爲國文不屑一學，或以爲國文可以隨便，不必注意，那末，這種人就不配做什麽事業，更不配談什麽學問。其實國文是一切學間，也是一切事業的某礎，是應該加　去努力進取的。我希望現在一般國人，尤其是靑年，都要以不通國文爲可恥，抱着「有則改之，無則加勉一的態度，去認眞從事才好！</p>
<h3>設立民衆敎育館</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>最近有很多的文章建議　淸賭塲，色情小册，並且當局已着手把賭塲對閉的消息也見　於報上，我想這是一個很可喜的一，　象，然而，　渣這些地方確是一件難事，因爲它在上海人的腦中印象太深了。所以要肅淸這些地方，我們必需要有代替這些地方的公益塲所才對。因此，我認爲普遍的設立民衆敎育館。</p>
<p>至於設立民衆敎育館的內容，我個人的意見以爲有下列幾點：</p>
<p>閱報室和閱覽室對於正常的　物應該提倡，所以，閱報室和閱覽室就是提倡正當讀物，肅淸不正當的讀物的好方法。</p>
<p>舉行有益的宣傳使麻　的人們醒來，並且，告訴他們各方面的知識</p>
<p>提倡有益的娛樂　淸有害民衆的娛樂塲，如歌塲等，另一方面，提倡有益於民衆的娛樂·</p>
<p>開　運動塲　偌大的上海却沒有可供市民運動的塲所，因此，我以為有開關運動塲、提倡運動的必要。</p>
<p>九月一日的民意　　，有人建議把跑馬　改建公團，我認爲公園已有七所之多，而運動塲所　無一處——公共運動塲而言——故把跑馬廳改健公園，我以爲改建運動塲來得好。</p>

<h3>Expectations for the New Shanghai Grain Organization</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in our discussion of political responsibility, we listed the recent failures in grain administration and pointed out where the responsibility lies. We believe that such important matters of public welfare must not be treated irresponsibly as child's play. If responsibility is not pursued today for A, and rewards and punishments are not clearly defined, how can we hold B accountable tomorrow, to warn them of right and wrong, and expect them to handle things perfectly? Currently, the procurement and allocation of rice and grain are being handled by a newly established Grain Control Committee. This new organization is about to be established and begin its work. Our expectations for this new organization are even more earnest than for any previous one!</p>
<p>Why do we discuss the grain problem repeatedly without tiring? The reason is simple: the grain problem is the problem of the people's livelihood; the price of grain is related to the general price level. If the problem is solved reasonably, the people's livelihood will be largely stabilized; conversely, if the problem develops abnormally, the people's livelihood will suffer more and more. These are not theories, but complete facts, common sense that everyone understands. Since our duty in the press is to be the voice of the people, we naturally cannot abandon our responsibility to criticize and advise on this most important issue of people's livelihood, the grain problem. Therefore, the meaning of our repeated and urgent appeals lies in this.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Do not forget the past, for it is a teacher for the future." They also said, "The overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind." We expect the new organization to handle things perfectly, and it must review the reasons for the failure of the old organization, study where the crux of the problem lies, and decide on measures for improvement. We have found that the cause of the old organization's failure was neither the organization itself being insensitive or incomplete, nor the laws and regulations being imperfect or not strict enough. The crux of the matter was the wrongdoing of some bad elements, who used their positions for personal gain, as we pointed out yesterday in a way that makes people's hair stand on end. Therefore, we can say with certainty that the crux of the old organization's failure was not in the organization or the laws, but entirely in the poor quality of personnel.</p>
<p>Now that we understand that poor personnel was the crux of past failures in grain administration, we hope that the new organization will pay special attention to this. At the same time, we would like to offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>The leading figures of the new organization certainly need to be absolutely fair, honest, decisive, and resolute. However, middle-level and lower-level cadres especially need to be loyal and devoted to their duties. Every employee must understand that participating in the grain administration is to serve the public and regulate the people's food supply, not to engage in business for profit. When the National General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control was first established, the chairman told the staff to take "fairness and honesty" as their service motto. Now, the new grain management organization also belongs to the Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control system, and we hope that the motto will be thoroughly observed. The leaders must especially recognize the importance of personnel at the middle and lower levels. With the future of grain administration in mind, the employment of personnel must be absolutely open, and no private individuals must be appointed. At the same time, people from all walks of life should also recognize the seriousness and importance of the grain administration and not casually recommend people, which would lead to mistakes and harm others. It is best to adopt a system of examination and screening, with strict selection. At the very least, a selection committee should be organized by senior cadres, inviting fair-minded people and experts from society to participate. All employees should undergo individual oral interviews, and a joint decision should be made on whether or not to employ them, to ensure that bad elements have no chance to get involved. We believe that the government reorganized the old organization and selected leading figures because the old organization was not well-managed. The expectations are high, and it is easy to imagine. The people have long suffered from the problems with grain administration, and their anticipation for this new organization and new people is even more evident. Those who have been entrusted with the task of leading this new organization are also aware of the expectations from all sides and are eager to present a new image. Personnel issues are the main key to future success or failure, and this is something the new organization should reflect on first.</p>
<p>Once the foundation of personnel is established, the procurement and transportation of rice and grain will naturally be easier to get on track. The amount of rations must be gradually increased to at least the minimum adequate amount, and there should absolutely be no more reductions, lest the public lose faith and the mistakes of the old organization be repeated. As for transportation problems, one should not be afraid to speak up, or shy away from hardship, but negotiate reasonably and fight for what is right, rather than shirking responsibility. This is the second thing the new organization should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The length of the ration period is related to the amount of the ration. If the amount of the ration is barely maintained and the ration period is extended, it is no different from reducing the amount of the ration. Therefore, the ration period should be shortened, not extended.</p>
<p>The composition of rations must be clearly stipulated and strictly enforced. The public notice should clearly state how much white rice, how much red rice, and how much broken rice there is, and the word "or" should not be used. The word "or" is ambiguous and gives those who handle the rations an opportunity to cheat. For example, if the notice says "one liter of white rice or one liter of broken rice," the recipients will definitely get all broken rice, and no white rice at all. Those who handle the rations will use the word "or" as an excuse to justify giving broken rice to the ration recipients, while selling the white rice on the black market for profit. On the one hand, they exploit the psychology of the so-called "du mi jie ji" (a class of people who wouldn't eat the lower quality 'du mi' rice) who do not eat broken rice, and on the other hand, they buy it back at a low price and sell it again, switching things around. To eliminate this kind of trickery and fraud, the type of rice sold must be clearly stipulated, with no ambiguity allowed.</p>
<p>The amount of rations for factory workers in production units, the working class, and the education sector should be specially increased, or special rations should be given.</p>
<p>Finally, we emphasize and point out that repeatedly changing the management organization is ultimately a passive solution. Only by renewing personnel, assigning responsibility, and clearly defining rewards and punishments can we take a proactive approach and achieve effective results. The rational adjustment of the people's food supply has reached a stage of utmost urgency. We hope that the government authorities and the new Shanghai grain organization will take immediate action to address it!</p>

On the one hand, they have retreated, and on the other hand, they have repeatedly counterattacked, but each time they have been met by the Japanese army's anti-aircraft defenses and air force, which have repelled them and inflicted heavy damage. On the 2nd, the Japanese air force attacked Jian'ou, Badong, and Sandouping, achieving great victories. The Japanese army will continue to attack in the future, and will definitely defeat the enemy's air force stationed in Chongqing, forcing them to abandon their ambition to attack. In addition, the enemy air force's losses in the past week are as follows: Enemy P/40 fighters attacked the Guangzhou and Hankou areas on August 27th. The Japanese air force flew to meet them, and the fleet fired, shooting down four of them in the Guangzhou area, of which two were not confirmed; and shooting down two in the Hankou area.

Jian'ou is the only base for the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing to attack Japan, and it is currently working hard to prepare for resupply. The Japanese air force launches surprise attacks whenever it discovers that the enemy is about to move, completely thwarting the enemy's plans.</p>
<h3>Food Ministry Authorities Answer Grain Questions; Public Rice Price Expected to Decrease</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A Central News Agency reporter visited the Food Ministry authorities on the 3rd and received answers to the current questions raised by the visitors. The main contents are as follows: (Question) Now that the new grain has been harvested, can the price of public rice be expected to decrease? (Answer) The Ministry is responsible for the overall planning of rice and grain allocation. Regardless of the rice price, the purchase has not stopped for a single day. The allocation price cannot but take into account the cost and limit the increase in the state treasury's responsibilities. The public rice sold on the market was allocated in early August. Because the original purchase price was at its peak, it was changed to 700 yuan per shi. However, according to cost calculations, there is still a loss of more than 200 yuan per shi. All the public rice allocated in August and September is old grain stored previously. The Ministry has not yet shipped large quantities of new rice, nor has it been added to the allocation. As the new grain enters the market, the price is not yet normal. If the source is abundant, the purchase price will naturally be leveled out, and the price of public rice will of course be adjusted accordingly. As for the occasional delay in allocation, it is due to various procedures. Or it may not be fully smooth, but the relevant agencies have made practical adjustments. The Ministry has always allocated on schedule and has not interrupted. (Question) The food problem in the north this year is serious, so southern rice and wheat are transported north to adjust. Is there a certain limit to the amount of northern transport? (Answer) There is a certain limit to the amount of southern rice and wheat transported to help the northern people's food supply. Each time, the quantity is determined first and then shipped separately.</p>

<h3>Japan and the United States Will Exchange Nationals Again Next Month</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Washington officials announced yesterday that the Swedish mail ship Gripsholm sailed from yesterday to Goa, a Portuguese colony on the west coast of India, to exchange nationals and goods with a Japanese repatriation ship for the first time.

It will also stop at Elizabeth Port, the capital of Sierra Leone, to load fuel and water.

<h3>The Balkans Become a Strong Fortress of Europe; Impossible for Anti-Axis Attempts to Invade</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Borsen Zeitung discussed the issue of invading the Balkans in its essay, stating that it has become the strongest stronghold of the European fortress. German workers have made the fortress an impregnable fortress. Germany cooperates with Romania, Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary, and other countries, so it will definitely be able to defend it. There are four gates for enemy troops to invade the area. One is the gate of Bessarabia, which is now closed; the other is defended by Turkey in the Dardanelles, and Turkey is now in strict neutrality; the third way is further south, and it is impossible to invade from Thessaloniki due to the protection of the islands; the fourth way, the Strait of Otranto, is also impassable, and the coastal area is firmly defended by German troops; therefore, there is no way for the anti-Axis powers to enter the Balkan Peninsula. Invading from all four sides requires the occupation of most of Italy. "The anti-Axis powers may have troops, air forces, and ships to invade Southeastern Europe, but realizing this invasion is more difficult than invading Sicily, because the distance is greater and there are fewer places to land. If local residents are used, the Balkan people support Europe, and the power of the guerrillas is no longer important. The power of united strength is invincible.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Military authorities here maintained complete silence regarding the reported British landing in southern Italy.

<h3>Goebbels States: German Unity is Ever Stronger; Victory is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Reuter: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Weekly" on the anniversary of the outbreak of the war, stating that the German people and their leaders cannot bear the responsibility for this war. Germany was forced to do this. Our intentions are all within the scope of peace. Our enemies had no internal difficulties before this war. Germany is now stronger than ever in all aspects, and Germany's position is also better than it was when the war broke out. All of this is due to the excellent strategy of the Führer. Today, we will never be forced to death by a lack of food or other supplies. We now have the conditions for victory. The war is full of changes, and although the development has its twists and turns, the favorable situation will eventually belong to us. We represent the ideals of a new era, and the enemy represents the old consciousness. The enemy actually wants to repeat the mistakes of Versailles, and even wants to intensify them, but we want to correct them. For this reason, in recent weeks, the British and American people have begun to doubt the continued conduct of the war. The terrorist air raids launched by the enemy have not been effective, and the enemy has made one mistake after another. Its every move is enough to strengthen our will to fight, so victory will belong to us.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt and Churchill Hold Day-Long Talks Yesterday; Adjusting Relations with the Soviet Union is the Main Topic</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held talks at the White House for almost the entire day yesterday. It is believed that they discussed relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially regarding the Soviet Union's criticism of the Anti-Axis military situation in Sicily. The news acknowledged that there had been political discord between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the British and American leaders are now trying to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Washington, Churchill met with U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall after arriving in Washington. In his speech in Quebec, Churchill repeatedly explained the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The media circles of the United States and Britain have also been strongly advocating that it is necessary to adjust the relationship between the three countries. American news reports have discussed the reasons for the difficulties in the three-nation talks, saying that there is no other way to adjust the relationship between the three countries except for the Soviet Union to cooperate in Europe. Instead of promoting permanent peace or seeking group security, it is better to explore the common points of interest between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Europe and East Asia. If the three countries can conclude an agreement in advance, then talks can be convened. Otherwise, it is a mistake to attempt to adjust the relationship between the three countries in the talks.</p>
<h3>Hopkins Observes the War Situation; It Will Take Two Years to End</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Recently, the anti-Axis camp has become increasingly optimistic about the development of the war in Europe, especially the United States. Hopkins, who has always styled himself as Roosevelt's strategist, recently wrote an article in an American magazine, discussing that the joint operations of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not be expected to end until 1945.

It is said that when U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with reporters on the 2nd, reporters asked what Hopkins meant by saying that the war would take at least two more years. Hull expressed his difficulty in answering this question, only saying that the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union is cordial, and such small problems will never have any impact on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>German Forces in the Donbas Region Adopt Elastic Tactics; Fierce Fighting Southeast of Smolensk</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Eastern Front, the German forces in the Donbas region are adopting extremely elastic defensive tactics, breaking the Soviet army's encirclement attempts and immediately launching fierce counterattacks to annihilate the Soviet army's remaining combat power, and are now gradually achieving their goals. On the 2nd, the German forces launched a forward defense battle on the 140-kilometer area from Lisichansk through Krasnoluti to Kchanikovo. The counterattack in the Lisichansk area was the fiercest. The Soviet army's operation to break through westward along the northern side of the Donbas has now completely stopped. The Soviet Information Bureau reported that the Soviet army had recaptured Lisichansk on the night of the 2nd, but there is no confirmed news from the German side. Even if the German army withdrew from the city to shorten the front line, it would not have much impact on the overall situation of the Donbas front. Reuters also reported that the Soviet army advancing westward from Taganrog had reached an area 40 kilometers west of Mariupol, but the German army seemed to have built a solid new position there. In addition, the German forces southeast of Smolensk completely stopped the Soviet army's advance, and launched a counterattack on the morning of the 2nd, launching a large-scale mechanized battle. The subsequent battle situation has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 2nd as follows: The situation on the Eastern Front has not changed in essence. Although the Soviet army used a large number of personnel and equipment to break through the German army's positions, every inch of land they gained came at a great sacrifice. In the Isom region, the Soviet army has mobilized strong mechanized units and restarted the attack. The fighting between the two armies is extremely fierce. The Soviet army has carried out breakthrough attacks with tank and infantry units on a narrow front line, but they have been repelled by the German army. The Soviet army west of Kharkov has launched a general offensive on a wide front line, but they have been repelled by the German army with a small number of troops, and one of the Soviet army's breakthroughs has been blocked off, destroying 56 of their tanks. The Soviet army has restarted the attack, but they were defeated with heavy losses before reaching the new German positions. At the Bolhov fortress, after fierce shelling on the 1st, the Soviet army attacked the German army with a regiment, and they were counterattacked by the German army, losing 352 men and retreating.</p>

<p>Soviet Demands</p>
<h3>Launch Attack on Europe Within Ten Weeks, Using Britain as a Base</h3>
<p>Soviet news magazines have recently begun to vigorously discuss the Second Front issue again. The Soviet view on when and where to open the anti-Axis Second Front against Germany is becoming clearer. A recent issue of the "War and the Working Class" magazine explicitly stated that the Second Front should be successfully opened this year. The "Pravda" newspaper of the 20th stated: "Judging from Britain's economic situation and strategic position, Britain is the best foothold for attacking Europe. To attack the European continent from Britain, it is only necessary to break through the 33-kilometer-wide English Channel."</p>
<p>Soviet Reasons</p>
<p>The Soviet Union argues that the Second Front must be opened this year for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Due to the progress of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front and the Axis retreat from Sicily, the current international situation presents an excellent opportunity to open the Second Front.</p>
<p>The Soviet army is resisting the entire pressure of the German army and launching a major war against Germany without rest. The delayed opening of the Second Front increases the burden on the Soviet army.</p>
<p>The delay of the Second Front contributes to the strengthening of the German defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Autumn is coming soon, and the autumn climate is not conducive to landing operations, making them extremely difficult. The favorable period for landing operations is only ten weeks.</p>
<p>Launch Attack on Europe Within Ten Weeks, Using Britain as a Base</p>
<p>Judging from what is said in the Soviet newspapers, the attitudes of Britain and the United States toward the Second Front issue seem to be different. First, regarding the timing of opening the Second Front, according to a recent issue of "War and the Working Class," some British politicians do not consider it such an imminent and urgent issue, but the Soviet Union believes that this is precisely an extremely urgent issue.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the location of opening the Second Front, judging from the recent operations of the anti-Axis forces, it seems that the Mediterranean has the possibility of becoming the main battlefield, but the aforementioned "Pravda" report believes that attacking Western Europe with Britain as a base can achieve greater results than operations in the Mediterranean. The newspaper pointed out that in Mediterranean operations, the transportation and replenishment of troops require more than twenty times the ship tonnage, and therefore advocated attacking Western Europe.</p>
<p>Future Developments Worth Watching</p>
<p>During the Quebec Conference, various discussions were apparently held regarding when and where to open the Second Front. The Soviet Union is watching the future of the conference with deep concern and awaiting its outcome. However, at this important moment, the Soviet government replaced its ambassadors to both Britain and the United States, which is extremely noteworthy. (Xiang: From the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, August 25th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce Discusses Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Seeking Legal and Proper Solutions for Merchants and Citizens Within the Scope of Not Violating the Spirit of Control</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) - The National General Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. A separate office has been established and is continuing to actively carry out this task. September 6th is the deadline for applications, and those who apply after the deadline will be subject to legal penalties. On the one hand, experts in the yarn and cloth industry have been hired to be responsible for assessing the quality of the goods, in order to clarify the purchase process and the future distribution situation. Our reporter was specially dispatched to interview Chairman Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce to inquire about everything. He gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Purchase Will Not Be Extended, Do Not Delay and Mislead Yourself</p>
<p>This time, our association has been ordered by the government to purchase cotton yarn and cloth. An office has been organized to handle this matter. Regarding the assessment of the quality of the goods, because we are afraid that people outside the industry will not be able to identify and assess them properly, we have hired people from the yarn and cloth industry to be responsible for the assessment. The nature of our association is a commercial collective. We have a duty to protect the legitimate interests of merchants, and we always take this as our purpose. The deadline for purchase is September 6th, as ordered by the government. There will be no further extensions. Our association believes that merchants and citizens who have not applied after the deadline will be subject to legal penalties, so we have repeatedly notified everyone that they must not have the same mentality as the previous registration, thinking that it can be supplemented repeatedly, which would be a self-inflicted mistake.</p>
<p>The Authorities Have Already Explained Future Handling Methods</p>
<p>There are rumors outside that there are doubts about the handling of the yarn and cloth after the purchase. The government authorities in Shanghai have already invited yarn and cloth industry leaders to explain that after the purchase, distribution methods will be formulated and announced for implementation to meet the needs of the people. If there is any movement out, it must be on the principle of exchanging goods. The distribution methods are said to be under investigation and planning, and will be announced and implemented soon. The distribution of cotton yarn and cloth to factories that use them as raw materials has also been considered, but it is necessary to first investigate the inventory of finished products and estimate the amount needed by the people before making regulations, so that finished products do not flood the market and cause overproduction, which would cause losses to manufacturing factories. Our association, standing in the position of a commercial collective, is always thinking about the interests of merchants, but because of our responsibilities, we can only seek legal and proper solutions for merchants within the scope of not violating the spirit of control. Beyond this, it is beyond our ability. This point should be understood by all business leaders.</p>
<p>It Is Absolutely Impossible to Pay the Price in One Lump Sum</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has also been mentioned that regarding the price of the purchase in accordance with government regulations, we are currently discussing with the Central Trust of China on how to make it convenient for the people based on government orders. As for the delivery of gold, it is all handled by the Central Trust, and of course it can be done in accordance with government regulations, so there is no need to worry. There is also a general discussion that the price should be paid in one lump sum to the yarn and cloth holders. This matter is closely related to preventing malignant currency inflation and is for the sake of people's livelihood and commodity prices, so it is absolutely impossible. Moreover, since the announcement of the purchase of yarn and cloth, up to now, no one has made a formal request to our association, which shows that the general public can also deeply understand this meaning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in this city has been established and has begun operations, and a deadline has been set for supplementary registration, which ends on the 6th. Therefore, all large and small cotton yarn and cloth shops and stores in this city have uniformly stopped selling cloth from the 1st of this month to sort out their inventory in order to report the facts truthfully and comply with the law. The Shanghai Cloth Industry Association issued a special notice yesterday stating, "Those who hold stack receipts issued by dyeing and weaving factories that are members of this association should apply for purchase within the deadline in accordance with the notice of the General Chamber of Commerce's office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Those who have not yet registered should also go to register and apply for purchase within the deadline. The removal permit issued by the purchase office, together with the stack receipt issued by the factory, should be presented to the factory to pick up the goods and transport them to the designated warehouse, and handle all procedures after applying for purchase. For the convenience of the receipt holders and the factory, receipt holders who have already registered or are supplementing registration should contact the factories that issued the stack receipts to avoid delays." The Yarn Shop Industry Association and the Cotton Products Industry Joint Association have also issued notices urging their members to apply for sale in accordance with the law, and must not have a wait-and-see attitude, so as not to be penalized for delay. If there are any acts of evasion, once discovered by the investigation agencies separately designated by the Executive Yuan, they will be punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>No Changes to the Jurisdiction of the Eighth District</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in order to establish the future prosperity of Greater Shanghai, has re-determined the scope of jurisdiction of the First District Public Office. Recently, there have been rumors that the jurisdiction of the Eighth District will also be changed, and that half of the walled city area of Nanshi will be划入管辖 Eighth District's jurisdiction, etc. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited the authorities concerned yesterday. According to them: The re-determination of the First District's jurisdiction is an established policy of the municipal government, to help promote the vigorous development of various industries. The rumors of changes in the jurisdiction of the Eighth District are purely speculations by the general public and are not reliable. So far, there has been no talk of any changes in the territory of the Nanshi District.</p>

<h3>Bose's Envoy, Mr. Loka, Arrives in Shanghai to Convey a Letter to Overseas Indians</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai News - In order to unite the Indian people scattered in various places, stir up the Indian anti-British independence movement, and achieve the goal of independence, Mr. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the commander-in-chief of the Indian National Army, has specially dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Loka Nayakadan of the Indian National Army as a special envoy.

<h3>Students Selected for Gu's Entrusted Scholarship Fund Determined: Yao Zhaobin and Four Others</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, Cheng Yi, and Zhong Qian specially established a middle school student scholarship fund for impoverished students in memory of their late father, Mr. Gu Ding, with five scholarships. All school fees, miscellaneous fees, and book fees stipulated by the school will be borne. If the academic performance is excellent, the funding will continue until graduation from high school.

After the preliminary examination of the middle school group for the previous scholarship fund, the five students who ranked at the top were Quan Jinkun, Liu Yiquan, Xi Dekai, Wu Bichang, and Zhang Lizhen. After individual investigations of impoverished families, they were recommended to the Gu family for funding. In this session, Quan Jinkun, Pei Dekai, and Zhang Lizhen, who are still performing well in school, will continue to be recommended. The two students, Liu Yiquan and Wu Bichang, gave up learning for business due to the hardships of their family environment. After the Scholarship Fund Committee decided, the two students who ranked at the top in the second group of the junior high school section in this session were selected to fill the vacancies, so that the academic programs would be consistent. After investigating the students' family conditions and confirming that they were truly impoverished, Yao Zhaoxiao and Jin Gan were selected. The Gu family has been notified for review. Other cases entrusted by various circles are also being processed.</p>
<p>Students who submitted letters yesterday requesting to cancel the scholarship that had already been approved include Chen Zhongshi, Wang Shide of the junior high school section, Zhang Guangyin of the university section, and Cui Jintang of the industry and commerce section.

The meeting adjourned at around 8:00 PM. The discussion program is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion Program</p>
<p>The backbone for constructing the new Shanghai is the people of Shanghai. How to make the people of Shanghai enthusiastically participate in this great work was discussed by Chen Binhe of Shen Bao and Seiyo Miyazaki of Asahi Shimbun. His Excellency the Chairman, at the reception on August 2, indicated that the key to establishing the central ideology of the Greater East Asia War is to construct the new Shanghai. How should this concept be further strengthened? Yang Huilang of the Central News Agency and Masataro Miyake of Yomiuri Shimbun expressed their views. Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather. How can residents from all directions work together towards the same goal? Hong Yan of the Xinwen Pao and Masao Kawasaki of Domei News Agency expressed their views. Among the foreign residents in Shanghai, Japanese residents account for the largest number. In all respects, the Chinese and Japanese people should share weal and woe and cooperate sincerely as a solid foundation for building the new Shanghai. How can greater progress be made in this regard through greater efforts? Jin Xiongbai of the Ping Pao and Ichiro Endo of the Japan Industrial Newspaper expressed their views. Sincere love and affection among the people must be achieved through emotional harmony and rational understanding. How can we further promote the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people and eliminate any barriers? Zhu Yongkang of the Guomin Xinwen She and Takaaki Kida of Mainichi Shimbun expressed their views. The press bears the mission of cultural ambassadors, and the exchange of Chinese and Japanese cultures is not only essential for building the new Shanghai, but also necessary for building Greater East Asia. What efforts should the Sino-Japanese press make in this regard? Wu Chengzhi of the Xin Zhongguo Bao and Hiroshi Kojima of the Tairiku Shinpo expressed their views.</p>
<h3>Cheng Deyuan Appointed as Head of the Second District Public Office</h3>
<p>The position of Head of the Second District Public Office in this city has now been filled by the municipal government, which has transferred Commissioner Cheng Deyuan to succeed. It is said that he is scheduled to take office on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Factories Applying to Restore Special Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>After the Rice and Flour Purchasing and Preparation Section of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office reduced the special rice ration for factories to half a liter in order to centralize the rationing of rice for households, the factories are now requesting an increase from the section, as it is not enough for the factory workers to eat.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>To the editor:</p>
<p>I recently saw a news item in your newspaper titled "Fire in Dongxinqiao Street Kills Eight." The article stated that "two barrels of highly flammable paint raw materials were stored in the writing room of the Xinhua Paint Factory on the second floor of No. 20, Yuzang Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, Eighth District. At 5:00 PM on the 29th, the fire suddenly broke out due to excessive weather." After investigation, our factory office moved to No. 50, Kangrong Village, Foch Road in October of last year. There is a registered household there. The second floor is the writing room of the Huasheng Guohuo Department Store. The report does not conform to the facts. I am writing to request that you correct the error.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xinhua Paint Manufacturing Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3>Northern Station Area Included in the Western Hongkou Police Bureau, Station Inspection Taken Over by the Bureau</h3>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the First Police Bureau ordered the Jiaxing Road Sub-bureau to be abolished and the jurisdictions of the Sihongkou Sub-bureau, Decewi Road Sub-bureau, Hongkou Sub-bureau, and Huishan Sub-bureau to be expanded, and a new sub-bureau was established on Xinbu Street (i.e., Jiangwan). It is understood that the jurisdiction of the Western Hongkou Sub-bureau extends to Zhabei West Zexing Road, Zhongshan Road, and Song Park Road, and the North Railway Station is also under the jurisdiction of the bureau. Therefore, the police force has also been increased. The sub-bureau has added more than 50 police officers since the 1st. The duty of inspecting travelers at the North Railway Station has also been changed to be carried out by police officers of the sub-bureau. The sub-bureau chief ordered one Chinese and one Japanese deputy inspector to lead dozens of police officers to patrol the newly expanded area and perform the duty of inspection at the North Station. The gambling dens and pawnshops on Suzhou Road have all been closed.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Reading Commander Kamata's Farewell Speech and Welcoming the New Commander Matsushima</h3>
<p>Commander Kamata, the Public Relations Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, has been ordered to take up an important position in Korea. He will soon leave office and has issued a farewell speech expressing his sorrow at parting. We were deeply moved after reading it.</p>
<p>Commander Kamata has been in China for more than ten years, spending the most time in Shanghai. He is quite familiar with the situation in China and has made the greatest efforts to promote Sino-Japanese relations. He is of a kind disposition and is truly a "friend of China." Since taking up the position of Public Relations Officer of the Fleet, and especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has devoted himself to the responsibility of protecting Chinese cultural propaganda work and guiding and promoting the significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation in joint operations. His contributions have been outstanding.</p>
<p>In addition, from the standpoint of this newspaper, it is particularly worth mentioning that Commander Kamata is the supervisor in charge of this newspaper. He has been very respectful and supportive of the past history and characteristics of this newspaper, so that it has been able to fully play its role as a civil forum and promote the significance of the Greater East Asia War. This great vision of valuing Chinese civil forums is truly admirable.</p>
<p>On the occasion of Commander Kamata's triumphant return to his country, we wish him a bright future and good health.</p>
<p>At the same time, we welcome Commander Matsushima to take over. Commander Matsushima is a well-known writer in the Japanese Navy and is even more concerned about cultural undertakings. We sincerely hope that Commander Matsushima will carry forward the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, assist the development of Chinese cultural undertakings, and work together for the victory of the Greater East Asia War!</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Track and Field Team Officially Established, Gathering All Shanghai Celebrities with Strong Strength</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Sports Association has successively organized football teams, tennis teams, women's basketball teams, etc. Now, in order to further promote sports, it has specially formed the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Track and Field Team, gathering all the Chinese celebrities in Shanghai, and it was officially established yesterday.

<h3>Press Conference by Kamada of the Japanese Fleet Public Relations Department, Mr. Matsushima's Address to the Press Corps</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The Public Relations Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, Colonel Masaichi Kamada, has been ordered to transfer and will be succeeded by Colonel Keizo Matsushima. The two Public Relations Officers, yesterday at 3 p.m. at the regular meeting of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs authorities, hosted reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city. In addition to the personal attendance of the two Public Relations Officers, Lieutenant Tanaka, Trustee Sakazume, Information Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and Vice Consul Fukuma were also present. During the meeting, Colonel Kamada introduced the new Public Relations Officer, Colonel Matsushima, and Mr. Matsushima gave a speech. The meeting concluded at around 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Address by the New Public Relations Officer, Mr. Matsushima</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to be appointed to the important post of Public Relations Officer of the Fleet in China following Colonel Kamada, and to be able to engage in the task of reporting under the decisive battle with the cooperation of all of you. I am of meager virtue and talent, and deeply feel the weight of responsibility, but I am determined to strive to avoid disgracing the illustrious achievements built by my predecessor. However, I am unfamiliar with the local situation. Moreover, I have little experience in reporting and hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and cooperation. The war situation has shown an increasingly fierce decisive battle, and the fighting on the Pacific front is becoming more and more self-evident. Our loyal Japanese soldiers are day and night annihilating stubborn enemies on land, sea, and air. At the same time, on the mainland, they are even busier with operational preparations and construction. During this period, under the consolidation of solidarity between China and Japan, the total strength is exerted for the completion of the Greater East Asia Holy War to continue the cause of the new East Asian nations, and to march toward the path of defeating the Anglo-Americans in a shared destiny of life and death. However, from now on, it is even more necessary to thoroughly understand the great righteousness of the Holy War, to shatter the enemy's violent aggression with the true value of Oriental culture, and to seek the final victory. We, who bear the important responsibility of reporting, should especially realize that our responsibility is becoming increasingly important. Unyielding and unwavering, this is our creed. I hope to work with you, with the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, to invigorate the reporting front and complete the important task."</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Colonel Matsushima</p>
<p>Colonel Keizo Matsushima, who succeeds the outgoing Fleet Public Relations Officer, is also an expert on China, with talent no less than that of Colonel Kamada. Mr. Matsushima graduated from the Naval Academy in Showa 6 (1931). From the summer of Showa 7 to the end of Showa 8, he served as a staff officer in the Shanghai Marine Corps. In August of Showa 12, he was dispatched to the Shanghai Military Attaché Office with a propaganda mission. In September of Showa 14, he served as the Executive Officer of the Izumo warship, protecting the Yangtze River, with outstanding achievements. This appointment as Public Relations Officer marks his fifth visit to Shanghai. Although Colonel Matsushima is a military man, he is also skilled in writing, with a well-known literary reputation. He has written famous works such as "Controlling the Sea, Real Victory," which describes the first phase of naval operations after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has received much praise, truly a man of both literary and military talent.</p>
<p>Farewell Address by Colonel Kamada</p>
<p>"On the occasion of my ordered transfer, I would like to say a few words to bid farewell. Having been involved with China for more than ten years, I feel infinite emotion at leaving China. What I cannot forget most during my tenure is that the National Government has taken up the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia as one of its tasks, and has announced a declaration of war against Britain and the United States with firm belief and enthusiasm. This is an unprecedented historical spectacle, and I am delighted that the National Government has resolutely participated in the Greater East Asia War and has made its strong will and implementation known both internally and externally. This is the expression of an enthusiasm that cannot be suppressed, aiming to unlock the common destiny of Asia for eternity. Japan has no ambition in Asia as the enemy propagates, as is evident from the handover of the concessions, and there is no need for further explanation. However, Britain and the United States have exhausted all their schemes to monopolize Asia and disregard the demands and development posture of this Greater East Asian cooperation for survival. Under their instigation, the Chiang Kai-shek regime, which has misinterpreted the meaning of Greater East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity, has adopted an anti-Japanese policy, truly creating contradictions in East Asia. These contradictions cannot be resolved by ordinary means, and I sincerely hope that Chongqing will soon gain awareness of Greater East Asia. Today's Greater East Asia War, due to the unprecedented results of our war in history, has completely placed the Philippines, the East Indies, Malaya, Burma, and other Pacific islands under our control, laying the foundation for the establishment of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We can say that the decisive battle will be from today onwards. Therefore, in order to eliminate the brutality of Britain and the United States and to achieve the common goal of building East Asia, the National Government must realize that there are still many hardships. On the occasion of my departure, I would like to urge our friendly nation, China, to rise up."</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Colonel Kamada</p>
<p>Colonel Kamada graduated from the Military Academy in Taisho 5 (1916) and was commissioned as a naval ensign in December of the same year. In Showa 6, he served as an adjutant and staff officer in the Shanghai Special Marine Corps. In Showa 9, he served as the captain of a warship. In Showa 13, he served as the executive officer. In Showa 14, he was appointed as a naval colonel and was ordered to be the military attaché in Shantou. On the 15th day of the 10th month of Showa 15, he served as an assistant to the naval attaché in Shanghai and as a staff officer of the China Area Fleet, and as a member of the Shanghai Naval Route Department, and made special efforts in customs countermeasures and the renovation of the Port of Shanghai. On September 1, he served as an assistant to the naval attaché in Shanghai and as a staff officer of the China Area Fleet, and has been in charge of internal and external publicity and reporting for the China Area Fleet since then. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the entry of the Japanese army into the concessions, he immediately began to take over and handle the news agencies used by the news agencies together with the implementing troops. At the same time, he also took on the task of forming and strengthening Japanese newspapers, dealing with and cracking down on prohibited radios, and preparing Chinese communications, guiding the creation of public opinion circles, and striving to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>

<h3>The Future of the Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association three months ago was in an era when its internal structure was not yet complete. Today's National Commercial Control Association is not only fully equipped in scale, but also holds full control. - It is not only the organization that handles the purchase and distribution of cotton yarn, but also the organization that manages food.</p>
<p>Speaking of commercial control which is vested with major problems relating to people's clothing and food, it is already the case that they are not talking about issues regarding the distribution of cotton yarn and food, otherwise, they have an unshirkable responsibility. We believe that the Commercial Control Association will value its distribution responsibilities as much as it values its purchase responsibilities, in other words, it will handle distribution with the same spirit and power as it handles purchasing. At the same time, we believe that after the Commercial Control Bureau promulgates the distribution methods formulated by the government, it will be able to publicly announce to the public the process of its execution of distribution from time to time. It must be known that the reason why the people welcome purchasing is none other than because they welcome distribution.</p>
<p>Therefore, we earnestly hope that the future Commercial Control Association will have close contact with the press to avoid the truth being unknown to the outside world.</p>
<h3>Industry Associations Establish Purchasing and Distribution Groups, Statistical Needs, and Proportional Distribution</h3>
<p>Since April of this year, industry associations in this city have successively implemented reorganization in accordance with the orders of the relevant authorities. In addition to revising the original articles of association, they have also changed the directors and supervisors. To date, the major industry associations have been completely reorganized, and the secondary associations have also completed 70% to 80% of the reorganization work. In order to adapt to the government's economic policies, the persons in charge of the various associations have strived to renovate the association's organization and have established close ties with the competent authorities, hoping that officials and merchants can fully cooperate. Summarizing the key points of the work after the reorganization of the various associations' organizations, it is nothing more than concentrating on purchasing and distribution. In order to strengthen work efficiency, the various associations have specially established two specialized groups for the purchase and distribution of materials, so that materials can circulate smoothly in the current wartime situation to enrich people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Appeal to the Authorities for Assistance in Procurement</p>
<p>The shortage of wartime materials is originally an inevitable phenomenon, but if no measures are taken to remedy it, the materials needed for people's daily life will easily be insufficient, and the price of such materials will inevitably soar. As a result, people's livelihoods will be insecure. In view of the fact that it is extremely difficult for members to purchase raw materials individually, and the transportation costs are also quite large, the various associations have decided to collect the materials needed by their members on a monthly basis. The various associations have compiled the various materials used by their members each month into a table, and plan to purchase them on a large scale from the producing areas on a monthly basis according to this standard. In order to make the purchase smooth, it is necessary to ask the relevant authorities for full assistance. The various associations have already submitted a request to the competent authorities, and on the one hand, they are allocating funds, sending purchasing agents, and considering transportation methods.</p>
<p>Collected Materials Are Distributed to Members</p>
<p>After the original materials are collected by the association in one day, they will be distributed to the members in full according to the purchase price. However, the scale of the members' stores varies, and the raw materials needed each month are also different. Therefore, the association will divide all the members into four levels: A, B, C, and D, and distribute them according to the level ratio. However, once a member obtains materials, they must all be used for legitimate purposes, and they are absolutely not allowed to sell them privately. Moreover, the finished products of the materials should be sold to legitimate users in full compliance with the price limit set by the association's evaluation committee. In view of the fact that if members engage in malpractice after the implementation of material distribution, its impact on the market will be significant, the various associations will first conduct credit investigations, examine the history of the members' stores, as well as the reputation and morality of the persons in charge, and then decide whether they can enjoy the right of distribution.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest Expected for Agricultural Products in Central China</h3>
<p>The Times reports: According to local business circles with access to informed sources, the collection and distribution of important agricultural products in Central China is quite satisfactory. The Wheat Professional Committee has already started collecting 200,000 tons of wheat. Although it is still far from the 800,000 tons projected for this year, it is widely reported that at least 450,000 tons of wheat may be obtained as it was last year. By the end of July, the committee had purchased 146,009 tons of wheat. According to a survey by relevant parties, the output of cotton in the amount of the year has increased greatly, and it is estimated that it will reach about 200,000 dans. This year's corn and other crops can also be harvested in Central China, and it is expected that the authorities can purchase 390,000 dans in various places.</p>
<h3>National Economic Survey Institute to Begin Work</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Dispatch) In order to expand the wartime economic policy system, the National Economic Commission decided to establish the National Economic Survey Institute through the second plenary session of the committee. Mr. Tang Junbo was appointed as the director of the institute (Mr. Tang is a member of the National Economic Commission and the president of Huazhong Hydroelectric Power). After active preparations, the institute will be formally established in the near future and will begin to conduct various economic surveys across the country.</p>
<h3>Industries Handling Year-End Settlements Before the Festival</h3>
<p>The 9th and 14th are the Mid-Autumn Festival, and various industries are following the usual practice of handling year-end settlements. For the goods released in the past, lists will be distributed and personnel will be sent to collect them. During this Mid-Autumn Festival settlement, all transactions are limited to cash. As for the funds for the Mid-Autumn Festival of various silver and money industries, they will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations, and the credit of the borrowers will be considered. In order to support the production industry, legitimate funds needed by various factories and firms will continue to be released, but the examination of the use will be particularly cautious, so as to prevent the use of funds from colluding with speculators.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Transactions by Non-Industry People in the Firewood and Charcoal Industry</h3>
<p>Although the firewood and charcoal market situation has been slightly calmer, the selling price is still high. It is reported that the leaders in the industry, in view of the fact that firewood and charcoal are essential necessities for daily cooking of residents, allowing their prices to remain high will inevitably harm the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, they have adopted a symptomatic and radical approach to the entire firewood and charcoal market situation, striving to balance the supply of firewood and charcoal spot goods. In addition to notifying the industry to comply with the association's regulations for buying and selling, and not to pass on a large number of spot goods to non-industry merchants, so as to prevent the evil practice of illegal hoarding, they also ask the authorities to dredge the sources and assist in transportation in order to increase inventory.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks first reported a rebound, and then, after a long period of decline, there was bound to be an aftermath. However, by noon, all stocks rose in unison. In general, people's hearts have been greatly strengthened. Wing On Company of the Department Store rose strongly, and the news of the second capital increase spread widely. Sellers held on to their shares, and the price moved toward a higher level in the midst of fluctuations, and finally rose significantly. Sincere Company followed suit and rose sharply. National Goods rose less. China Underwear and Sundries Company also saw a slight increase. In the textile industry, Da Sheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories still stood at the original price, and Wing On Textile rose slightly. Mei Ya Weaving rose the most sharply. Small denomination stocks such as Xinyi, Hongsheng, and Dachung Textiles all stopped their decline and turned firm. The new medicine industry rose, and new Asia, Sino-French, Five Continents, and Xinyi all made significant progress. China was flat alone, and New Star, Scientific Chemical, and Star Perfume also stood firm. In the cultural industry, the World Bureau is still striving to improve. Commercial Press and Zhonghua in the buying momentum to return upward. Yongxiang, Qungong, Jin Feng, and other paper products all have buying activities. Shanghai Public Utilities is relatively stable. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Public Utility Appliances, Shanghai and Xiangsheng Third Transportation also opened around the previous day's price. Real estate stocks are still stable, and Xin Yi and Yongxing are also slightly higher. Industrial stocks were more sluggish. Jiu An, Xingye, Dachung Industrial, and New Asia Construction, China and National Investment were all slightly down in a sluggish and flat market. Great China Match pulled a higher stock at noon, and rose sharply. Nanyang Tobacco Company showed a tired attitude. Family Industries still stood at the original price. Fumin Dairy was quite active, with a 30% real increase. Standard MSG was particularly firm, and Guanshengyuan and Mei Lin cans all rose. Sanyou Industrial, Anbao Glass, Zhonghua Film, Zhongxing Timber, Defeng Needle, and Dahua Planting all stopped their decline and turned firm.</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial Situation</h3>
<p>Government bonds first weakened and then strengthened yesterday. The middle was more or less exciting, but the trend still cannot be said to have escaped the fluctuating situation. Class C initial trades once rebounded slightly, and then gradually became firmer. By noon, there were buyers, and the situation seemed to have turned around. Class A, B, E, and D were also quietly firm.</p>
<p>Rice and grains: Very few goods arrived from the South Port Gang, and there were not many scattered transactions. Retailers still made purchases, and the price rose compared with the previous market. Northern japonica rice was also firm, and late rice fluctuated.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains: Because the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has formulated a purchasing and distribution plan, the implementation period is not up to par, so buyers are not active. Both soybeans and green broad beans have scarce arrivals and sales, and prices have fallen. There is no market for the rest.</p>
<p>Medicinal materials: Sales remained stagnant, foreign and Tianjin Huai goods were all sluggish, and Sichuan goods and Hongqiu were both quiet. The market is tending to be flat and tired.</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics: Industry peers are all holding the view of not entering or exiting for the time being. The prices in this city and other places are mostly inverted, so customers also lack needs. The sales of factories and stores and shops are all weak, and the retail prices are all in accordance with the authorities' limited price range. Due to sluggish sales, the money market is obviously loose and secretly tight, and they have all turned flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Deliberation Council Established, Chen Guangzhong Talks About Striving to Complete the Task</h3>
<p>In order to control wartime materials, the National Government has separately established the Materials Control Deliberation Council and the National Commercial Control Association. Our country's wartime material control work is progressing step by step. Since the Deliberation Council belongs to the Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate work, an office was established in Shanghai. After active preparations, it was established on the 1st and started office work. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the office yesterday, and Mr. Chen Guangzhong received him and made the following statement: "The Materials Control Deliberation Council is the highest body for deliberating wartime material control, and the council is located in Nanjing. However, Shanghai is the industrial and economic center of our country. Agricultural products must be transported to be manufactured, and industrial products are transported from Shanghai to various places for manufacturing and sale. This cycle is endless. All of these activities are active in the Shanghai area, which is also the spleen and stomach of the country's destiny. Therefore, the executive body of material control, the National Commercial Control Association, is located in Shanghai, and its intention lies in this. The establishment of this office is to seek close contact with all relevant parties in Shanghai, or to report the opinions of all parties to the General Assembly. Those that can be solved locally due to local conditions can be contacted by this office and the committee members and cadres without missing the opportunity to complete the mission of material control. Since I was ordered to prepare, I was fortunate to have the assistance of all parties, so that I could start working first. The internal organization has also been prepared, and the organizational aspects include a secretariat and two groups, the first and the second, which officially started work on September 1. At the beginning of the opening of this office, in addition to following the order of Chairman Zhou of this council to strive to complete the task of this office, there is nothing else to say. I consider myself to be of meager ability, and I am deeply ashamed. I hope that all parties involved in Sino-Japanese relations will not hesitate to provide guidance and assistance, and I am looking forward to it very much."</p>

<h3>Chinese People and Chinese Language</h3>
<p>— Shaosheng</p>
<p>"Chinese language" is the language of the country. All cultured countries have their own languages. Since Chinese is the language of the country, then all citizens of the country should be proficient in the language of the country, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>But regrettably, many young people in our country, under the control of the mentality that "everything foreign is good," must use foreign goods for things needed in life. Therefore, for language, only foreign languages will do. According to them, understanding a few sentences of foreign language is very remarkable and can be used to boast about peers! And those who do not understand foreign languages also have the same mentality of admiration and worship, and feel ashamed and regrettable for not knowing foreign languages! Due to the control of this mentality, Chinese language is discarded like worn-out shoes. We are not against learning foreign languages, and in order to understand foreign things, learning foreign languages is still very necessary. We are only against that kind of blind worship of foreign languages - this is simply a slave mentality - "spiritual subjugation"!</p>
<p>In addition, there is another group of people who, although they do not have the same mentality as the people mentioned above, still do not pay attention to Chinese language, especially the young people who spend money on writing schools. When attending Chinese language class, they often feel bored and disgusted. They are often seen stealing peeks at other books or imitating Zai Yu napping, in order to muddle through this "annoying homework." When the teacher assigns compositions, they often do it perfunctorily, either randomly copying or writing a few words and that's it. This kind of practice is also not acceptable. In the past, the "mediocrity of Chinese language skills" and "unclear thinking" in the preliminary examination of the higher examination were not necessarily the evil consequences of this reason.</p>
<p>We only feel that the attitude of the first type of people towards Chinese language is "too servile," and there is nothing else to say. If they can suddenly wake up, it may not be a great thing. They all do not understand the importance of Chinese language to them, so they have some erroneous mentality. We are willing to contribute some opinions to them.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about how the citizens of a country should be proficient in their language. The effectiveness of Chinese language is multifaceted. No matter what kind of learning you like or what kind of person you hope to be, for example, if you like literature and hope to be a literary writer, then at least you must be proficient in Chinese language in order to write good works, which goes without saying. It is the same if you hope to be a secretary or clerk. If you hope to be a translator, then in addition to being proficient in foreign languages, you must also be equally proficient in Chinese language in order to translate something decent, and achieve the level of Yan Fu's so-called "faithfulness," "elegance," and "expressiveness." As for the narrative texts of news reporters, the texts of political claims by politicians, the creation of complaints by lawyers for clients, the narrative experiment reports of scientists, the prescriptions of doctors, the creation and review reports of accountants, and the making of advertisements by businessmen, all require a proficient level of Chinese language.</p>
<p>In short, Chinese language is something that every citizen must be familiar with and must not be ignored. If you think that Chinese language is not worth learning or that Chinese language can be casual and does not need attention, then this kind of person is not worthy of doing any career, let alone talking about any learning. In fact, Chinese language is the foundation of all learning and all careers, and it should be worked hard to improve. I hope that the general public, especially young people, will be ashamed of not being proficient in Chinese language, and adopt the attitude of "correcting it if we have it, and encouraging ourselves if we don't," and earnestly engage in it!</p>
<h3>Establish Public Education Halls</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many articles suggesting to clear the gambling dens and pornographic pamphlets, and the news that the authorities have started to close the gambling dens has also been seen in the newspapers. I think this is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, clearing these places is indeed a difficult task, because the impression in the minds of Shanghai people is too deep. Therefore, to clear these places, we must have public welfare places to replace these places. Therefore, I believe that the widespread establishment of public education halls is necessary.</p>
<p>As for the content of establishing public education halls, my personal opinion is that there are the following points:</p>
<p>Reading rooms and reading rooms should promote normal reading materials, so reading rooms and reading rooms are a good way to promote legitimate reading materials and clear up illegitimate reading materials.</p>
<p>Hold beneficial propaganda to wake up numb people and tell them about all aspects of knowledge</p>
<p>Promote beneficial entertainment and clear up entertainment venues that harm the public, such as song halls, etc. On the other hand, promote entertainment that is beneficial to the public.</p>
<p>Open sports grounds. Shanghai is so big, but there are no places for citizens to exercise. Therefore, I think it is necessary to open sports grounds and promote sports.</p>
<p>In the public opinion section of September 1, someone suggested that the racecourse be rebuilt into a public park. I think there are already as many as seven parks, but there are no sports grounds - public sports grounds, that is - so I think it is better to rebuild the racecourse into a sports ground.</p>

<h3>Destitute After the Death of a Poor Teacher, Family Members in Urgent Need of Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Kanru from Jiangdu taught at Nankai, Hujiang Affiliated High School, Old Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou High School, etc. for more than 20 years. The family was originally poor. Unfortunately, he suffered from a serious illness in February and finally died on August 4 after half a year of suffering. He was destitute after his death, leaving behind a wife and four weak daughters who cannot survive and are in urgent need of assistance. Colleagues have limited abilities. Thinking of Mr. teaching for many years, there must be no shortage of outstanding students. I hope that people and students at sea will show sympathy, pity the orphans, and start a righteous act.
