<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">論物資配給 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>生產减少，運輸困難，是戰時物資缺乏，供求不能　劑，物價逐步上漲的原因。在平時物價上漲，足以刺激生產，故供求旋告平衡，物價隨以低落。可是，戰時因為生產運輸種種都受限制，供求根本無法平衡，加以投機者消費者推波助瀾，競華　積收購，於是物資之缺乏愈甚，物價度之日常生活而不可得。實行配給制度，暈要施用政治力量，來消弭這種不平等現家，以維隷整個社會之秩序安寗。配給辦法實行以後，對於少數人之享受固不免加以限制，但是多數人之生活，却以此得有保障。國家是建立於全民眾的基磷之上的，自應以荃民眾之利益為依歸。再為少數之特殊階級着想，人盡飢塞，我獨溫飽，則過飽亦豈能久，結果寗非同歸於盡。故配給辦法之實施，不特政府當取斷然熊度，即各級民眾，亦均應犧牲小我，顧全大我，予以熱誠之擁護。</p>
<p>施行配給辦法之目的，在　節供求，平抑物價，安定民生，戰時世界各國以配給辦理完簪而顧收物價穩定之效果者，如日本即其一例。根據日本銀行所發表之日本批發物價指數，日本國內批發物價，在本年六月底尚不逮事變之一倍。任何人不能不承認道是實行物資配給制度的成功。</p>
<p>我國當局有鑒於年來物價暴漲，已成社會嚴重問題，毅然實行物資統制政策，對於若干種關係民生最重要之物品，並已陸續採用配給辦法，論埋凡購配給物品，價格應即逐漸回跌，然而專踵恰得其反·例如米糧配給實行已逾一年，可是最近黑市米價，竟已超過實行配給時之五倍。為什麼配給辦法行之於各國均可以收到穩定物價的效果，在我國就無效呢？道當然是配給辦法還有未繼完善之處。那末，我們就應該對於這一點，切實檢討，設法改善。</p>
<p>嚴格的說，實行配給辦法以後，第一是全部物資都歸政府統制。第二是人民都已得到生活需要，根本就不應再有黑市的存在。退一步說，縱使仍有黑市，也於社會民生無關重輕。不過要做到這一步，過有一個重要條件，就是配給數量和實際需要數量相差不能過遠，否則人民為維持生存起見，其舉不得不仍仰給於黑市，結果祗有給予黑市以更大之操縱之機會。過去我國的配給，不幸正坐此病。以戶口米而言，配給量平均不足實際需要量三分之一。在這種情形之下，想消滅黑市，平抑米價，於情於法，均不可能。當局果有貫澈配給辦法之決心，必項先將各種物資配給數量重新檢討，合理規定。否則配給自配給，黑市自黑市，如今日之米市情形，其結果祗有自增粉擾，徒傷威信，於政府誠為有貢失面無一得者。</p>
<p>配給數量之能否提高，首視統制收購成績，最後仍決定於生產數最，此三者實有密切聯帶關係。收購之成績不佳，則配給無所施其技。生產之數量不足，則收購無所用其力。今後欲求配給量與實際需要量相稱，第一，必須根據實際需要量，作成生產計劃，集合政府與人民之力量，向此目標，共同邁進，期以必成。第二，必須改善以往的收購方式和收購價格，利用政治力量强制收買，任意壓低價格使農民在成本以下忍痛出售，挑剔尅扣使農民敢怒而不敢曾，不但要影響到收購，還要影響到生產。假使過去這種錯誤不痛自糾正，就是統制機關未能克盡責任，同時，就是貽誤人民生活。</p>
<p>最後還有一個更大的要求，就是無論生產者消費者，都應該認淸時代，了解國家統制物資的意義，人人抱犧牲小我之精神，以公共的利益為前提。那麼配給制度的前途，定可事半功倍。</p>

<p>現在把他的機要說一說，過去的十月二十七日　是美國的海軍紀念日的那一天　晨，敵人一個部隊在渡根　爾島南方的摩　島上陸了。</p>
<p>在遵以前我方的海軍航空部隊在他們的登陸地點的摩　島的東北海面上發現了，配有巡洋艦驅逐艦護衛艦隊的輸送船及大型上陸用艦艇共計有十數隻的數人艦批出現，於是使不避時機的對那一個船開加以果政的猛擊，浚一戰的戰果，是轟沉巡游艦二隻·擊破巡洋艦二隻。聶擊沉輪送船二雙。舉破輸送船一雙·共中有一隻巡洋艦是由我方的自爆機三架中的一架實際用機體擔衡而　沉的。</p>
<p>但是敵人還是固執的繼續着他們的跳石作戰，一面連日的以一百架內外的航空大報隊强行　擊被根繼爾島及拉巴爾方面，二十八日的午前曾　以七十九架的大編隊來擊在波根維爾島東方的巴拉列鳥的我軍陣地，常時我們的守備隊擊落了他二十七架。以後我們海軍就銳意的監視敵方的動靜，在十月三十日的期晨，發現了敵方的有力的輪沒船團，分成數電，由新佐治亞島南方海面北上，這時候所在的帝國海軍航空部隊，及海上部隊，優立刻關始邀擊航空都隊，從三十一日的夜裹到十一月二的早晨之問，在摩諾島東方海面和波根維爾島西方海面，攻擊配有一部份上空直衝的敵方輸送船　海上部隊，在十一月一日的夜裹，在波根維爾島卡塞列灣外和敵方的有力巡凈艦及驅　艦部隊交戰，這一戰的綜合戰果是：轟沉或擊沉破巡洋艦九雙，應迢艦入隻·輪送團四隻。舟艇四十雙以上，擊堅飛機十架，我方的損害僅僅有驅遂艦一隻沉沒，巡洋艦一雙小破，自爆未蘇這的飛機共計十五架。</p>
<p>詫這個中間有敵方的一個部隊在十一月一日的朝展，由波機離爾島時特羅基納角附近上　，二日的朝盛從哈粟南面地區上陸了，但是我方的陳軍部隊立　對他們加以邀擊，那時候海軍航空部隊及海上部隊也曾經協力殘滅敵方的上陸部隊。</p>
<p>在這個中間敵方一面以航空戰支持玻根維爾鳥方面的上陸作戰，一面對我方的拉巴爾募地加以猛攻，十一月二日在拉巴爾我方曾經由海陸空三面協力對來自敵方的二百費十架飛機應戰，結果擊擊他二百零一架，損折他的大部，我方也失去了十五架飛機。</p>
<p>至於這一次航空戰的妻絕情形。我們根據敵方的一側空襲隊員所說的「凄慘不可形容」這句話，也可以推測到了。</p>
<p>又在玻根維爾鳥北方的布加島十一月二日大概有一百三十五架的敵機來襲，那時候我方的地上部隊擊擊了他三十九架。</p>
<p>從十月巾旬以來，敵方在北部所羅門和新不列願方面試行的空襲，非常凄慘，損害比率是十三，四對一，實在是世界的紀錄所沒有的數字。在這一過前後的海空戰裹敵方損失的人員，恐怕不下一萬名，眞是使敵人不能不心胆皆寒。</p>
<p>四日的早晨，敵方以戰爆聯合共一百五十人架的大縱隊來襲玻根維爾鳥的布英，這時候我方擊堅敵體十五架。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c23">迎江特拉·鮑斯氏 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 南孝</p>
<p>自由印度臨時政府領袖江特拉。鮑斯氏。自東京乘機訪問南京。於昨日（二十一日）到達上海。</p>
<p>在我們眼前，見到印度人狂歡的情形。這大約是僑滬的印度人，到現在爲止，第一次這檬欣喜吧！他們自到上法以來，常被英美人所　弄，做他們的走狗。他們幾次要想自己挻起來。但經不起英美的一擊，而又倒下了，以至於今日，然而現在，大東亞的民族解放了，自由印度領袖鮑斯氏來滬。印度人乃欣喜若狂。我們相信今日印度人的這喜悅，將來會永久機攢下去。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏七月上旬出現於昭南，四個月來，奔走於泰國·緬甸。馬來半島之間，日無暇疊。氏的努力獲得了報酬，在大東亞會議中，作爲大東亞民族解放的一領袖而列席。一百七十年來，作爲英殖民地霸王的無上之冠，或作爲英帝國的牝牛，有時作爲英國的勞働者及兵士，印度所貢獻於英國者，不遠一一枚奉。然而英國所報答印度的劣跡，即如英國人自己亦常加指摘，不　一一枚舉。在英國看來，印度實是英殖民帝國的中心。因此，鮑斯氏在昭南島發表獨立宣曾，在英國實是致命的打擊。印度爲了英國的分割政治，陷於空前的飢　中。但英國要人們却袖手旁觀，不加援手。他們如其回想過去一百七十年間所施於印度人者，則今日所發生的事情，自在意料之中。</p>
<p>英國受了兩次打擊</p>
<p>英國自成爲近世殖民運動的　王以來，到今日爲止，受到二次致命的打擊。其一是美國的獨立，其二是此次印度的獨立。兩者的獨立在性宜上雖有不同，但在給與全體人類的巨大影響胡一點上，則是相同的。美國十三州公然對英國獨立，突入決戰狀態，英國在那時候巳經應眩對於人類解放得到了重大教訓，但依然　於殖民地的榨取。美　獨立時，對英國大聲疾呼印度人的自由，然而現在英美變成一邱之貉。聯合對東亞，從事大決戰。被虐者（美）與虐待奢（英）變成奧味相投的同類了，美國的獨立宣言中說：</p>
<p>『一切人類賦有造物主所不能剝奪的權利。這權利就是生命·財產·幸福的追求。（中略）任何政府，苟有破埋此目的之憂者，改革之，廢止之，般新政府，確保爲獲得人民的安全和幸福的原則，在理想的形式上組擻其權利，盖即人民的權利。』</p>
<p>美國是這様獨立的，印度的現狀，比當時美國這要深刻。印度的獨立，從此方面說來是當然的。又印度的獨立，乃是常然的順序。</p>
<p>獨立的理由，巳如上述，但我們此較印度的獨立和美國的獨立時，發見極大的不同。那就是人種。有色人和白種人的不同。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏的熱烈廣播</p>
<p>從『亞洲是一家』的話看來，鮑斯二十日在迎賓館對重慶作四十分鐘的热烈廣播中，也乎以贊囘。</p>
<p>大東亞十億民族中。不完全獨立的是中國和印度，所以我們對鮑斯氏獨立運動上的热烈希望，乃給與中國民眾的絕大感動。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏在涉及亞洲的獨立上，宣稱必須『第一，中國的統一，第二，印度的自由。』而妨害中國統一　是英美。說渝方是中國統一的妨害者之日本，巳在希忽束亞的團結了。</p>
<p>重慶巳沒有抗戰的名目而依然抗戰。爲東亞唯一的異己分子，殘留下千載不磨的悔恨。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏説；賭君究竟和何人作戰呢？諸君愈繼續抗下去，愈中英美的計策，　君的負債愈大。』『爲了英美之利己的本能，結果賭君爲他們作食物』。「假使中國民眾要統一，二十四小時內就可以實現』。「但獲致中國民衆的幸福和繁榮之統一「不是靠英美的援助能夠實現的。』</p>
<p>鮑斯氏用過去半生和英國戰鬥的热淚，大聲疾呼重慶反省！</p>
<p>聽到這話，我們可以知現在的印度，和獨立時的美國，有更深刻的獨立的理由。現階段上印度的獨立，實是發見了作爲亞洲民族解放的一環之印度的立傷。在這意義上，鮑斯對重慶的播送，實有極深的意義。</p>

<p>第二次破根維爾鳥大戰果，是日本海軍在長時期的沉默中、繼珍珠灣一役後，所投的第二個互彈，沉入南太平洋海底的敵艦船，實進二四艘！還大戰果完全是日夜在飛機不艉艇·及補充工作上努力的將士們所造成的。</p>
<p>商船隊出發</p>
<p>〇月〇日　商船隊定於〇時出港。本艦為哨戒港，先行出發，欀頭高揭著信號簱，指揮驅潛枇〇艘，顧流而出港口。還裹是南太平洋〇〇基地，海面有我海軍機來往巡弋着。〇時出港的般團，教成在進攻中的顧次隊形，開始「之字運動J。額衛艦艇的艦橋上，指揮哨上，牆樓上，都端正了海上哨戒的配置·似鐮刀般的月堯，在雲裹探出頭來。因敵方潛水艦不分　夜的　躍，瞭望員自〇〇名增至〇〇名。最近的敵方潛水經情形，正如瞭望員們所說：「月入五分前」，「日出五分前」，乘海面色彩變化的時候出沒。這商船隊裝着很多的南方資源，如其這些束西能夠平安抵達本國，則再滿載戰爭實材出征第一錢。現在是一雙商船也不容沈沒的時候。購衛艦艇的責任，多麼重要啊！</p>
<p>〇月〇日　「準備樹空配置」·第〇天的十一時方過，突然聽得了這傳令聲。敵轟炸機五架前來　擊我船團。那時本艦已用高速力速航。著白色均航跡·動出了迅急的灌曲綫·繼身開始左右動搖。</p>
<p>「右卅度廿，高度〇千、」</p>
<p>指揮哨的號令枕着淸晰。噠噠噠……噠噠噠…一賣向敵機邀擊，同時，敵機也柏拉拍拉的投下炸彈來。敵機的炸彈，都落在船團的前後左右，落人海中，在那水烟申，我船開的船首悠然前進。敵機怕我們體衛艦艇所發出的砲火的威力，不能飛到船　的項上。僅胡　　下了炸彈就飛去了。</p>
<p>「深謝貴艦奮鬥！」</p>
<p>各商船揭出了這信號旗。</p>
<p>擊沈敵潛水艇</p>
<p>〇月〇日　向北通的路程愈見紓曲了，是夜，本艦瞭望員在陣雨中發見浮上水面的敵潛水艇。</p>
<p>「準備對潘配置！」</p>
<p>距離本艦不過〇千米，敵潛水艇在無憲之中浮現，見到我船　，狠狽奐措，慌忙潛航。</p>
<p>「對了！」「面舵！」</p>
<p>「開始投射！」</p>
<p>不久，海中起了破裂的炸聲。</p>
<p>「確實了！」「確實了！」</p>
<p>將校們，艦長，都說着有自信的話。</p>
<p>「船團無恙！」</p>
<p>船團亳未發生變故，默默進航。</p>
<p>暴風雨天氣</p>
<p>〇月〇日　天明時起，波瀋汹湧，艦身震搖，氣兼報告說有颱風的危險。</p>
<p>「準備暴風雨！」的命令下來了。</p>
<p>內火艇掛起了二重三重的繩。甲板上也張了繩，以便往來時攀用。士官室的嘗架和椅子也都用細繩轉起來，不使動搖。午　方過。巨風起來了，浪濤比舷側還要高，遮沒了水平綫。但我船團的耳目仍甚尖銳，據潛水艦來的情報，瞥告離我們船團四十哩，有敵方潛水艇。水艦在入夜之前，　行船團一周，定在船團的教面。波溶愈來愈高，艦猶如在山脈的中腹，千仞的谷度中進行。午前四時起，無壓表的低氣壓綫。開始直角急降下，一小時候，降下七百卅一米里。波浪變成三角波·風速十米，椅的電綫和旗繩噓噓地出聲。船團被濃霧包國、完全不見什麼。三角波咚咚地撞擊艦底。不像是海水，</p>
<p>「剛有潛水艦情報來，要通過危險海面時，颱風來了。那是神風喲！潛水艦絕對不能出來了。」</p>
<p>指揮哨的〇兵薯這樣說。</p>
<p>「天變了！天變了！」</p>
<p>着黑雨衣的瞭報員大叫着。眼上　着望遠鏡，除不下了。</p>
<p>飐風一過魚雷來了</p>
<p>〇月〇日　午前六時左右，卒漁人颶風的中心。海水打上艦擔。流落至旗甲板。實是凄烈的飐風。</p>
<p>「船團將怎樣？」</p>
<p>艦長說：「過午可突破這　風圓。已經指合船團在通颱風後集結於〇〇度的位置。」</p>
<p>本艦發見商給二艘時，已經過了颱風的中心了。但因逆風，浪高，猶加從山脈的項上走下茺海，行近商船。商船是船團的第○號及第〇號。</p>
<p>「別的商船在那裹不明。」</p>
<p>二雙商船用信號旗回答。本緩護衛這二船向○〇度的集結地點前進。颱風遼去了，波浪漸息了。突然從第〇號綫所得咚咚的聲音。</p>
<p>「需擊！」</p>
<p>千鈞一髪的一霎那。本艦的荷葉輪轉變至全速力·急轉向發出聲音的地方。從本艦後尾投下的炸當擊！　！　！在海中破裂。</p>
<p>「這也是囑？」</p>
<p>兵士們在艦內轟然大笑。因為有本艦在內，不能不是雷擊。那場合，像本艦那樣滿載着火藥和重擒·所以比商船更為危險。</p>
<p>任務完畢</p>
<p>〇月〇日　海漸次平靜了。平靜之後，對數潛的　戒，更須緊張。瞭寫員們都目不轉睛地注視着　。就在那時候。又發見了數潛的位置，緊迫着我船　。　　「準備對潛配置！」</p>
<p>本艦一面用信號這知船團數潛的位置，一面向那方向急　。敵潛向團發出扇形般七個魚　。蒼白色的實跡，似數條帶一般，隱約在海面。我商船巧妙地巡避了。其中有二發定時魚需過船團後方才爆發。我們照魚幣發出的地方，向數潛頭上投射炸雷</p>
<p>「敵人潛下了。現在大約外殺破了潛水漫入艦內，深沈海底了吧！或許電氣裝置被破壞，不能動彈了。大　都葬身魚腹了。」　　水電長笑着。如次，從〇〇其地出港，繆〇〇日問，由於護衛艦　之片　不息的活躍，船團安然無事，返　〇〇港·（　：譯自十一月十三日每日新聞）</p>

<p>排除阻難，一路擊滅敵人，戰果漸漸明期的南太平洋的決戰場，使人深深感到「大戰在後面哩」！光榮的波根維爾鳥洋面的空戰詳報，接連傳來，在敵機盲炸和高射砲彈的炸裂聲中，記者握筆疾記。以下便是參加當日攻擊的急降下轟炸隊員所述的攻擊概况。</p>
<p>枕戈待發</p>
<p>急降下轟炸機隊和戰門機隊接到出擊的命令，是在十一月八日淸晨。早就待機攻擊，但總沒有可以攻擊的數船團，正在慨歎英雄無用武之地的當兒，一接到大船團出現於波根維爾島敵軍登陸地點附近的快報時，搭乘員爭先恐後地攀登愛機，準備「炸它一個片甲不留」！　　在這××航空基地，已快入雨季了，酷暴當令，炎熱異常，十餘日以來，連一陣雨也沒有過。夢生於廣大的飛行場上的野草，都被炎陽灼焦。當編隊飛機的引擎一齊開始旋轉時，瞬時捲起了一陣的　埃，連口眼都張不開。就是言重展張着的烟幕，也不過如此吧。在這應烟蔽天之中，購艇緊抱着　公斤炸彈的轟炸機，每　幾秒　　陸一架。</p>
<p>踏上征途</p>
<p>滿佈基地上空的轟炸機隊與掩護的戰門　隊，展開翅翼，整隊出發。每個人的購中都磅礡着雄心。這是戰門聶炸混合大編隊的白蠶强襲呀！二十分，三十分，時間迅遠過去。H大尉統率x　際先行，　　架的急降下聶炸機勝着前進，指向敵船團所在的上空族飛。天氣幸而都是　期的。從飄浮於翼下的斷靈的間隙，可以望到一平無波的靑色大海。高度x　，速力計的針指着　　遠，靜然不動。引擎隆隆，螺漿迅速旋轉。在左方的遠處，從斷雲間已可葱見波根維爾島的巨姿。高達三千餘公尺的巴爾比山，隱約雲間。再過　X分，我們抵達了戰場。　譽環顧四面，一絲不亂的後繼機組成了堂堂的編隊陣　緊緊跟來。戰鬥機隊突將速力減低，銳利的眼光閃閃，警戒邀擊的敵機。又是五分鐘十分鐘過去了，突然從傳聲管中傳來了偵察員的大聲：「在哪，敵船團！」果真，在左翼下，於敵軍上陸鐘點托洛基拿（Torokina）蟬洋面二千公尺附近，有巡徉艦，驅逐艦各　雙嚴密體衛着的運輸船X　隻，用十五浬的速力向北航行。</p>
<p>展開襲擊</p>
<p>護衛的戰門俄隊突然離開編隊全速向東北飛降。隨眼望去，疊成種形的敵方戰們機羣正從靈間向轟炸機隊衝來。「來啦！」一面不覺這樣想着，一面却開始急降下，將敵方戰鬥機交給友方防衛機去對付。轟炸機的一軍，突破雲問，從　　公尺高度將機首對着海面直衡。剎那間，敵方的防禦砲火一齊吐火。敵船團的高角砲和乓乓砲瘋狂般集中射擊。突然、天空墨黑，彈幕包轟着森炸機隊的前後左右。鮮紅的曳光彈穿過了彈　，奪目眩眼。攻擊隊員咬聚了牙，張大了充血的眼球，開始拿手傑作的急降下轟炸。轟炸團，船紛起火。有些左玆仰斜，快將沉沒；有些開足馬力，企圖這定。一瞬間，寧靜的海面化成了鬼哭神號的修羅場。後擅機羣不息聯續强襲。也有投下炸彈後在扳起機首的當兒受到敵方防禦砲火的直擊而自炸的友機。也有躍隊從友方戰鬥機間隙中偷過來的格拉曼F4F戰門機而再行急降下轟炸的　機。這樣，激烈萬分的決死攻學，在五分鐘內即告完畢。敵方驅逐艦三艘，運輸船四隻剎時沉沒；巡洋艦二艘，運輸船一隻受傷；敵機十五架被擊下　。於是戰炸混合攻擊隊高奏凱歌，還師　　基地。</p>
<p>高歌凱旋</p>
<p>初十的月亮，白銀似地照耀靑空。這遠的西南天際，佈滿亂積雲，電聲隆隆，雲光閃閃，祗是不曾降兩。傍晚的斜陽還射出强烈的紅光，大地如火。戰鬥機掩護下的急降下轟炸機隊歸返基地上空時，另一批攻擊隊正在整裝待發、因為據報在波根維爾島西南方四十五浬的海面，正有一支包含戰北航進中。（仁木海軍報道班員發——吉：譯自十一月十七日兩日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c34">防空壕中捷報傳來 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>那天晚上，我們走入防空壕，飛機於層　間的敵方渡音式轟炸機的凄厲機聲，和轟然怒吼的友方高與　地的發射聲·備耳欲聾·簡直連氣也透不出。</p>
<p>危險，危險</p>
<p>「落下來了！」不知誰在低聲喊道。剎那間，突然感到大地的發撼。被探照燈四面八方照住。而高射砲的炮聲又火花似地不斷在其四周炸裂的敵機，大約又和通去一樣在盲投炸彈了。背後的山腰那邊，發出了矗然的爆炸聲一陣爆風　入　　曾間降下用機槍掃射的數機攻羣而送進來的吧。」我這樣想着。不料，他一隻手揮着空的香烟盒，愉快地向士官說：</p>
<p>「波根維爾島洋面的正確戰果，現在明白了，我來報告你們。」</p>
<p>這一句括。剎時使壕中的人全都忘掉頭上的敵機，欣喜激動，心房眼得滿滿的。</p>
<p>七日的薄幕。從偵察機拍來了一個急電，據說已在布根維爾島耗洛基拿岬洋面附近發見以敵艦四艘為中心的大機動部隊，　　某地立即充滿了殺氣。</p>
<p>這樣，第二天八日的被曉，我們立在宿會之外，歡送壯士出發。隆隆地震動若丹田的機擊，在頭上響着，向南飛去。展開堂堂　　的戰鬥機和轟炸機的信號燈，在晨星　　的黎明的天空，閃閃發光，漸漸消减於水平綫的那方我揮着帽，虔誠默　此行成功。</p>
<p>二小時，三小時—時間在焦燥中慢慢過去。在如烯的　射的陽光下，我們立在椰子樹的　　中，　　着遙遼的南方的天空，等待着　　夏威夷　珠　頭以來尙未有過的敵方大艦隊的　　。</p>
<p>大捷聲中</p>
<p>已是　個鐘點了，我們再向蔚藍的天空狂熱地揮着帽子，迎接朝晨出動的大編隊。當編隊的黑點出現於天際時，我們的心便　跳到了喉嚨口。可是，一小時，二小時，又是幾個焦燥的時間過去了，從遼遠的飛行塲那面，仍沒有多少戰訊傳來。走到街上去，碰到的士兵都問道：「報道班員，戰果未明嗎？」其後，擊沈戰艦二艘啦，轟沈四雙啦，傳來了種種情報，但尋不是正確的。不過，誰都相信　局一定是珍珠灣以來僅有的戰果，所以大家都舉杯慶賀大　。</p>
<p>備曹長的消息旣然是要據航人的電報，當然是不會錯的。在這樣的前提下，靜聆他朗朗地報吿道：</p>
<p>「擊沈戰艦三·巡洋艦二（轟沈）·驅逐艦三·運輸船四·鹵菜艦一艘起火大破，大巡洋艦三艘以上大破，巡洋艦又大型驅逐艦三艘起火大破，大型運輸船一艘起火大破，敵機十二架。這是迄今為止所判明的部份，再加上其後來的才可確實。」（吉：譯自十一月十七日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>微求欄中幾個小小的字，「某某時裝公司聘女職員數位」，映久了沁痰的眼　，却有飯碗那宋大，她用了最快的速度換上了她那件頂入時的藍布旗袍，鏡子中她那張太平常的臉兒在閃動着，門砰的一聲，她拿了她那張曾用數年腦汁和心血而得到的大學文憑，懷了僑俸的心，沖出她的灶披間了。</p>
<p>秋風微拂中沁痕終於是擠入了那肥紅瘦綠的姑娘們中了，膩人的粉香直向她的鼻孔中鑽來，好容易換到她進辦公室接洽的時候，一手拿文憑，一手不知該故在甚麼地方才好，臉上的肌肉緊縮着，跨着怪不自然的步子，走到正中寫字檯前，看對面坐着，一位肥頭胖耳的中年男子，室中四週的沙發上還坐着綫位四裝革履的人，都用着說利的目光在她全身掃射着。問　在她耳鼓上震動了，她侷促的答覆，失望漸漸的漫入了沁痕的內心，慢慢的爬上她那張太平常的臉，光亮的地板上，模糊的影子在向門口移動，微微抬頭，看見迎面而進來的是一團刺眼的花團。</p>

<p>本屆四靑籃球，將於今晚（二十二日）展幕。此次參加者：甲組十二隊，乙組遠四十二隊之多，可謂滬上籃球隊出動總動員令，同後白克路畔一番盛况可以預下。茲乘此展　之前，誌述先曾，頣各球隊予以採納，並作甲組各隊實力剖視，亦為球迷之參考焉！凡一籃球隊之要有優良難，要亦為華隊心腹之患一，所不到者，缺乏耐性表演，決非偶然之湊合，歷來歸標得主，自有其條件在焉！要之；為全隊隊員氣力充沛，技術純熱，聲個隊的合作，以及作戰時之隨時更變策略，變前作精密之調整。賽後作勝收集點之研究。此外更貴乎肌從教練，精神始終如一，能如斯，則表演之精彩，決可呈現，而運動之　諦，亦於此中領略得到。然觀乎滬上各球隊，共多至展幕期近，始決定人員，不免有烏合之嫌、且均乏良好教練，以致輙造成功虧一贊之情形，甚以為可　，記者爰不揣納見，略誌數語，顧各隊勿以老生常談，而三復我言，　則收獲不難較優，幸甚！茲略作甲組各隊實力剖視如　：</p>
<p>巨人隊—在試探賽中，功績略著，迭破各隊，雖不能即以此蓋棺定論，然其優點，頗足道者。為全隊勁旅，用人釘人，頗得其所者，場地熱，佔上便宜，其攻後衛用阻擋法進攻，及利用長人浮尼克站於敵籃下以待跟進之機。猶憶當年海賊萊恩，亦以此勝人，實為危險人物，且有凱旋洛夫之從中指揮，全隊進退甚快。勝之殊。</p>
<p>中北隊—採五人聯防法，以隊員之俱屬老將，故尚見精彩，唯其得分鎖鑰之隊學崇及沈奉恭二人，　時隨心所欲，反之則茫無頭緒，所以成收每須視當日之球運。而其唯一之缺憾者，記者總覺共打來不能天衣無縫，藍學崇之慣於作人釘人之術，以此之故，有時有相左表演。總之。該隊好事以為，尚不失為一有希望之隊也。</p>
<p>仁餘隊—唯一之待點，為物神最好，值得一提，其戰術守時特別緊湊，攻時用高速度．惜乎身材短小。吃虧殊多，本屆與冰隊合作，兩鋒起用新人，當有驚人之作為，我人拭目以待！</p>
<p>華聯隊—人材平均，且均結實夠氣，採人釘人戰術，頗見功夫，而全隊負有幾年以上之契默，聯絡純熱，惜乎熱中帶野，犯規易多，如能改過此點。爐火純靑，可以登峯造極，勉之！</p>
<p>蒙納克—為乙組晉升甲組之隊，其戰衛與巨人同，全隊以黑人却利為主題，頗能採人之長補已之短經騐幼稚耳。</p>
<p>華影隊—以電影從業員，以有限之餘暇、活躍球壇，且列為甲組隊伍，實屬繼能可賣。共成績一般人預測，以為必居股軍，然觀其試探賽中上半時覺勝巨人，是則亦未可小視。其特點，絕對服從敎練、其快　，球賽時間，輙輿拍戲時間相同。故精湛五人·未必能每場蒞臨，此不能補足之點。依記者眼光，該隊成绩，可居中中地位。</p>
<p>東方與業餘—俱為百樂門之化身。東方有都本生入伍，包松圓之助陣，益以張少卿，王鏡瑚，及靑島新來名將郭其昌。業餘為祥龍，阿奎，周智及紅隊之陶紹生，何孝光，兩隊均採人釘人戰術。稍以體力不勝為缺點，然溯之已往在四靑之光榮戰續，固不難有良好成績。</p>
<p>華南與同仁—均為弟兄隊，合作上有峽蝶穿花之妙。可稱輕快悅人。尤以華兩為佳，其前鋒胡金桂之地板功夫，與馮念華有異曲同工之妙，故華南之成績，雖不能名列前茅，然有幾場精彩鏡頭，可以歡言，同仁人大矮小為致會傷。旣不測很近，又不得籃下之球，全特地板漲司．實　乎其難，天賦不利，何以　耶？</p>
<p>大華與三輪—大聲為　約　沈繼恩等所組織。有自備球塲在大電路，故以之名，全隊轟絡尙佳，大敵少臨，心慌處亂之表濱甚多。嚴以幾日，可以成器。三輪為前復旦老胳　仁安　祥瑞等集成，以其氣力之不夠，而採用人釘人，吃虧異常，且意志不測統一，其戰而已！（潔）</p>
<p>[P＞足聯甲組强弱已分　東聯警成鼎足　葡商僑聯猶有可為猶太三省棋差一着＜P]</p>
<p>足球聯賽甲組上還備一場，警僑之戰，記者已為文記之。前昨兩日有三塲演出，爰菲記之，已不難按圖索驥！</p>
<p>東華輕取猶太　　過六（二十日）下午三時半戰於膠州公園，雖明知一面倒之局勢，而熱烈之觀眾，仍不避四風之侵人之入骨，可見愛戴東華之一班。</p>
<p>東華本屆自譚福楨孫錦順張林根周紀四將來歸，軍　甚茂有紛主之期·而猶太主將脫輻，故預料共必一面倒也。然「黑馬」猶能奪得兩球洵非易易</p>
<p>東華之攻，仍不脫其小派司之特點，引人入勝。中路戴買孫果有相當之聯絡，而兩翼之活躍，利用有效之翼傳翼及真確之勾中！司謂盡善盡美。老譚之面面俱倒，可與宋靈聖相媲美。林根，龍海，樹棠之老到，一道防城，已臻鞏固。後防莊李自應無懈可擊，周紀尚嫌生疏</p>
<p>所覺不足者；龍海新病初愈，力猶未充。林根有時街出太前，有時却落之過後，好在其刀大斧闊，尚能遮其短處，設能地位站好，未使非一良好前衛也。</p>
<p>兩翼新人值得一論；王錫勝奔跑有餘，機警亦足，勾中又有可觀，此戰供給老孫三記適當之球，使老孫發揮沙空妙射之球。允稱得意　作。其不夠之處，有攻門絕好地位等，乃現猶疑而已！李垚之左翼，在目下滬上缺乏此項人材之際，可說良好之材，其竄之速，其派司之力，已屆相當程度。尤可嚴者，攻門極盡巧妙之能事。球迷有謂其漸現驕態，記者深盼李君有則改之，無則加勉，寄與厚望焉！</p>
<p>猶太之表演，不若理想之漫無頭緒，在艱難情形下，始終振驚以往，獲得兩球。萊這，溫脫之嬌健，更銳利可畏，惟全隊技術較差，不難氣短也，其收也宜矣！</p>
<p>聯誼大勝三省</p>
<p>日昨（二十一日）上午十時半門于逸園，看合面南，陽光十足，看球殊舒適也。</p>
<p>聯誼攻勢如破竹，寬以十對一絕大比數獲勝，初非臆料之中。事前李義臣不出，眾以為聯誼勝固無異議，亦不免吃力之苦，不料三省隊亦以健將不公，而敵不堪一擊。</p>

<p>義臣據云，遵共岳父所囑，不苒馳聘球場，乃以　永編任鋒。　雖活潑，其脚頭不遠義臣達甚，則攻勞減削不少。况左翼獲敬鏡愈振岳俱不足重任。錢老氣樣　，俞經驗倘少，况阿布難免有關閒之時，保正又勇敢過度，失其所在，費春學更喜歡多幷小花巧，故攻勞實有可慮之點甚多。且也中衛綫永福一出，替以蔡聲　。相差不可以道里計。將使天生吃重不少。以是守衛方面，亦大見吃緊。記者　以為不能以大勝而論定，前途類須加意前邊，庶幾有望。</p>
<p>三省原應離風，加入甲組，為切磋而來。且以潘氏及王神你竭力督促注重精神，借他人之球藝，為自己之採納。以精神之美德，為運動　意義發揭，其用意之深長，令人偑服·論人材余隊均屬少壯之輩，徐滙同志，聯絡亦有可觀之處。總以經騐未充，路數不騐，而麥兩森周文奎之表演，頗有大將風度，右翼薛鵬魁能於底角二十碼左右，遙射破日劉關，可以豪矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Allocation of Resources <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Decreased production and transportation difficulties are the reasons for wartime material shortages, the inability of supply and demand to balance, and the gradual increase in prices. In peacetime, price increases are enough to stimulate production, so supply and demand are quickly balanced, and prices then fall. However, during wartime, production and transportation are restricted in every way, supply and demand cannot be balanced at all, and speculators and consumers add fuel to the fire, competing to hoard and purchase goods. As a result, the lack of materials becomes more severe, and prices soar, making daily necessities unattainable. Implementing a rationing system requires the use of political power to eliminate this inequality and maintain the order and tranquility of society as a whole. After the implementation of rationing, the enjoyment of a few people will inevitably be restricted, but the lives of the majority will be guaranteed. The country is built on the foundation of all its people, and it should naturally be based on the interests of the entire population. If we only consider the special class of a few, and people are starving while I am well-fed, how can overeating last long? In the end, wouldn't it be a common ruin? Therefore, the implementation of rationing measures requires not only the government to take decisive action, but also all levels of the people to sacrifice the small self for the sake of the greater self and give it enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>The purpose of implementing rationing is to regulate supply and demand, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. In the world during wartime, Japan is an example of a country that has successfully managed rationing and achieved price stability. According to the Japanese wholesale price index published by the Bank of Japan, domestic wholesale prices in Japan at the end of June this year were still less than double what they were before the incident. No one can deny that this is a success of implementing a resource rationing system.</p>
<p>In view of the soaring prices in recent years, which have become a serious social problem, our authorities have resolutely implemented a resource control policy, and have successively adopted rationing measures for several items that are most important to people's livelihood. It is argued that after the purchase of rationed goods, prices should gradually fall back, but the opposite is happening. For example, rice rationing has been implemented for more than a year, but recently the black market price of rice has actually exceeded five times the price at the time of the implementation of rationing. Why can rationing measures achieve the effect of stabilizing prices in other countries, but not in our country? This is of course because there are still imperfections in the rationing measures. In that case, we should conduct a thorough review of this point and find ways to improve it.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, after the implementation of rationing, first, all materials are under government control; second, the people have already obtained the necessities of life, and there should be no black market at all. As a step back, even if there is still a black market, it is not of great importance to society and people's livelihood. However, to achieve this step, there is an important condition: the amount of rationed goods should not be too far from the actual amount needed; otherwise, in order to maintain their survival, people will have to rely on the black market, which will only give the black market greater opportunities for manipulation. Unfortunately, our country's past rationing has suffered from this problem. Taking household rice as an example, the rationed amount is on average less than one-third of the actual amount needed. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to eliminate the black market and stabilize rice prices, whether in terms of reason or law. If the authorities are determined to implement the rationing method, they must first re-examine and reasonably stipulate the rationing amount of various materials. Otherwise, rationing will be rationing, and the black market will be the black market, as is the case with today's rice market. The result will only be to increase disturbances and damage credibility, which is truly a loss for the government.</p>
<p>Whether the amount of rations can be increased depends first on the results of controlled purchases, and ultimately on the amount of production. These three are closely related. If the results of the purchase are not good, then rationing cannot be used. If the amount of production is insufficient, then the purchase cannot be used. In the future, if we want the amount of rations to be commensurate with the actual amount needed, first, we must formulate a production plan based on the actual amount needed, gather the strength of the government and the people, and move towards this goal together, aiming for success. Second, we must improve the previous purchase methods and purchase prices. Using political power to forcibly buy, arbitrarily lowering prices to force farmers to sell at a loss below cost, and picking faults and deducting payments to make farmers dare to be angry but not dare to speak, will not only affect the purchase, but also affect production. If these past mistakes are not thoroughly corrected, it means that the control agency has failed to fulfill its responsibilities, and at the same time, it is misleading the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an even greater requirement: both producers and consumers should recognize the times, understand the meaning of national resource control, and everyone should embrace the spirit of sacrificing the small self for the sake of the greater good, with the public interest as the premise. Then the future of the rationing system will surely be twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram) Chen Zhishi, Vice Minister of Finance, met with a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday and explained in detail the issue of funds for the Business Control Council to purchase various materials and financial institutions. The details are as follows: Question: "Regarding the huge amount of funds needed by the Business Control Council to purchase various materials, will the financial authorities allocate them, or will the council raise them on its own?" Answer: "The amount of funds needed to purchase materials is relatively large, and the quantity of materials to be purchased must have precise planning and statistics. Therefore, each council should raise its own funds, and the government will guarantee them so that they can proceed according to plan in order to achieve proper distribution." Question: "Recently, there have been a large number of newly established small banks around Beijing and Shanghai. Will this trend affect the financial institutions? Does the Ministry of Finance have any countermeasures to crack down on them?" Answer: "Banks are the hub of financial institutions, and their establishment and closure are naturally related to several financial institutions. The Ministry has issued a statement on December 18 of last year to terminate the registration of newly established financial institutions in Shanghai. All applications submitted to the Ministry after the above deadline will be completely rejected. However, among them, there are those that have been approved for registration by the Ministry before the deadline but opened later, and those that were originally partnership money shops that reorganized into companies in accordance with the Ministry's regulations and continued to operate. The Ministry has made a public announcement in May of this year. As for the newly established financial institutions in Nanjing and other places, the Ministry will also make a statement at the same time, and will handle them separately in consideration of the local situation. If there are too many newly established banks, which are related to the national economy and social finance, the Ministry will investigate the situation at any time and restrict them separately. Those who have established them without approval should be cracked down on in accordance with the law."</p>

<h3 id="e12">German Army Has Air Superiority in the Aegean Sea, British Troops on Samos Island May Not Be Able to Hold Out for Long <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) A dispatch from Huitong News Agency: The recent developments in the Aegean Sea can at least prevent the Allied forces from launching a large-scale landing this year. Almost all the islands in the Aegean Sea are controlled by the German army, with only Samos Island still occupied by the British. The determination of the war in this area should be based on the air superiority of both sides, and the inability of the Axis forces to have a closer air force base is a major disadvantage. In terms of the strength of the garrison on Samos Island, it is about 10,000 people. If the German army wants to land on the island, the environment is far better than that of Rhodes Island, one is a cliff, and the other is mostly flat beaches. Moreover, the garrison on Samos Island also has difficulties in supply, and its supplies rely only on air transport. The British also admit that the German side has air superiority there. In terms of sea transport, since the German army occupied the main islands, the British naval superiority has also been difficult to maintain. For the sake of reputation, the enemy has to defend Samos Island with all its might, and the situation on both sides is so disparate. Therefore, it is a tragedy for the enemy. The surrender of the Badoglio regime is of no benefit to the enemy in the Aegean Sea. The situation in the Adriatic Sea is also the same. Although the Allied forces now have the Strait of Otranto, they may land at the teaching points on the east coast of Italy. However, the enemy troops have already suffered a lot in the war in southern Italy. Whether they intend to create a similar situation in the Balkans is still a major question.</p>

<p>Ankara, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) It was learned here last night that Mr. Gadru, the special envoy of Mr. Goul, declared to reporters yesterday that the Lebanese issue has been basically resolved. He refused to disclose whether he had consulted the opinions of the dismissed Lebanese government. At the same time, he denied that he had signed any announcement confirming the unrestrained independence of Lebanon. It was also reported that Germaine had expressed his opposition to the establishment of an international anti-Axis committee to resolve the matter, saying that this would only increase the difficulty. He also stated that Lebanon could not be made independent before discussing it with the League of Nations, because the matter was not only an issue between France and Lebanon, but also an issue between Britain and France. It was also reported that the arrested officials of the Lebanese government will be released but will not be reinstated.</p>

<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) A communique issued by the German Führer's headquarters on Sunday stated that the enemy in the northeast of Korsch continued to attempt to expand its bridgehead, but was repelled in the fierce drama.

The German army carried out a powerful counterattack in a tenacious and arduous defensive battle, thus making all the enemy's attempts to break through ineffective. In this battle, no less than 247 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The German counterattack west of Kiev continued to progress. Several stubborn resistances were ineffective.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) German News Agency dispatch: West of Gomel, the Soviet army attacked the German line under the cover of a strong tank column, but was repelled. There was a large defensive battle in the Nivil River Bend all day long. The Soviet army broke through several local gaps in the area.

<p>(Yesterday) The battle in the South Pacific is looking fiercer, and the enemy is continuing a desperate counterattack. As a result, our interception operation is making it impossible for the enemy not to carry out a bloody battle. However, the enemy still does not change its ways, and thinking of some successes in the past, they continue their resistance. However, the operational experience of the last half month or so can confirm how meaningless this counterattack of the enemy is.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you the key points. In the past, on October 27th, which was the U.S. Navy Day, in the morning, an enemy unit landed on Mono Island, south of Guadalcanal Island.</p>
<p>Prior to this, our naval aviation unit discovered on the northeast sea of Mono Island, the landing point, a fleet of transport ships and large landing craft with a total of ten ships equipped with cruisers, destroyers, and escort ships. Therefore, without avoiding the opportunity, it launched a decisive attack on that ship, and the battle result was to sink two cruisers, destroy two cruisers, sink two transport ships, and destroy one transport ship. Among them, one cruiser was actually sunk by one of the three self-detonating aircraft of our side using the fuselage.</p>
<p>However, the enemy stubbornly continued their island-hopping operation, and continued to forcibly strike Guadalcanal Island and Rabaul with air force formations of about 100 aircraft every day. On the morning of the 28th, a large formation of 79 aircraft attacked our military position on Balale Island, east of Bougainville Island. At that time, our garrison shot down 27 of them. Afterwards, our navy keenly monitored the enemy's movements, and on the morning of October 30th, it discovered a powerful enemy merchant fleet, divided into several squadrons, heading north from the sea south of New Georgia Island. At this time, the imperial naval aviation unit and maritime unit immediately began to intercept the aviation troops. From the night of the 31st to the morning of November 2nd, they attacked the enemy transport ships and maritime unit equipped with some aerial direct assaults on the sea east of Mono Island and the sea west of Bougainville Island. On the night of November 1st, they engaged in battle with the enemy's powerful cruiser and destroyer fleet outside Kasserine Bay on Bougainville Island. The overall battle result of this battle was: nine cruisers bombed and sunk or sunk, two destroyer ships, four transport fleets, more than forty boats, and ten aircraft destroyed. Our side's losses were only one destroyer sunk, two cruisers slightly damaged, and a total of fifteen aircraft that did not detonate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, an enemy unit landed near Cape Torokina, off Bougainville Island, on the morning of November 1st, and landed from the Haiso area on the morning of the 2nd. However, our army immediately launched an interception against them, and at that time the naval aviation unit and maritime unit also cooperated in annihilating the enemy's landing unit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the enemy supported the landing operation on Bougainville Island with air warfare, and launched a fierce attack on our Rabaul base. On November 2nd, our side cooperated on the sea, land, and air to fight against 210 aircraft from the enemy in Rabaul. As a result, 201 aircraft were shot down, and most of them were damaged. Our side also lost 15 aircraft.</p>
<p>As for the tragic situation of this air battle, we can also infer from the phrase "tragic and indescribable" said by an enemy air raid team member.</p>
<p>Also, on Buka Island, north of Bougainville Island, about 135 enemy aircraft attacked on November 2nd. At that time, our ground troops shot down 39 of them.</p>
<p>Since mid-October, the air raids carried out by the enemy in the northern Solomon Islands and New Britain have been very tragic. The damage ratio is thirteen or four to one, which is really a number that has never been seen in world records. In the naval and air battles before and after this, the enemy's personnel losses are probably no less than 10,000, which is really chilling for the enemy.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, the enemy attacked Buin on Bougainville Island with a large squadron of 150 fighter-bombers. At this time, our side shot down 15 enemy aircraft. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Central News Agency Report: The Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo, Japan, took a trip to China on his way back to his country. First, he went to our national capital to pay his respects to our leader and had a cordial conversation. After staying in Nanjing for several days and receiving a warm welcome from all sectors of our society, he took a special plane from Nanjing to Shanghai at 11 a.m. yesterday (the 21st). Relevant officials from both Chinese and Japanese authorities in this city went to the airport to welcome him. After Chairman Bose disembarked from the plane, he took a short rest in the VIP lounge at the airport. At noon, he arrived at the Cathay Hotel by car. The route was heavily guarded by Chinese and Japanese military and police personnel. Immediately upon arrival, he attended a welcome banquet held by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy at the invitation of Minister Tajiri. The head of the intelligence department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi, and the head of the intelligence department of the Shanghai Office, Mr. Hirota, also attended the banquet. Officials from the municipal government and relevant Japanese army and navy authorities in Shanghai were also present. At 2 p.m., a tea party was held on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to receive reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers. Chairman Bose, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel N. G. Swamy and Secretary Hassan, attended the party. The head of the intelligence department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi, the head of the intelligence department, Mr. Hirota, the head of the army reporting department, Major Izubuchi, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Lieutenant Sakamoto, and Captain Nagashima of the fleet reporting department were also present.

The scene was enthusiastic. All Indian expatriates then went to the Grand Theater for a mass meeting of the Indian community.

During the banquet, the guests conversed cordially and toasted each other until around 9 p.m., when the party ended on a joyful note.</p>
<p>Welcome from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>To welcome the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, to Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city held a grand welcome rally at the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3 p.m. sharp. Mayor Chen Gongbo accompanied Chairman Bose to the venue on time. The entire audience stood up to pay their respects. Also present were Mr. N. G. Swamy and Mr. Hassan, members of Bose’s delegation, as well as our Ambassador Tang Liangli, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue of the Municipal Government, Chief Su Zhou Changde, Director Lin Jiongan, Section Chief, Councilor Pan Lian, and Director of Municipal Affairs Bureau, Mingqi, representatives from industry, commerce, academia, baojia, and youth, totaling more than 30 people. Chairman Yuan Ludeng of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also participated. The scene was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The national flags of China and India were hung high in the center of the venue, creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere. Mayor Chen delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Chairman Bose.</p>
<p>Mayor’s Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "Ladies and gentlemen, today I represent the people of Shanghai in extending a welcome to Chairman Bose. The citizens of Shanghai welcome Chairman Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, with the utmost enthusiasm, and even more welcome Bose, the leader who is fighting for the independence and freedom of India. Although Chairman Bose's visit is short, I firmly believe that it has united our leader and the masses of China into an inseparable friendly entity between China and India. The British policy of oppression in India is a policy of 'divide and rule,' which has caused immeasurable sacrifices to the Indian people. Throughout history, countless Indian people have sacrificed themselves for liberation, with their great achievements clearly documented. However, Britain not only fails to grant India independence but also seeks to divide India, because without division, Britain would have no way to rule. Chairman Bose is leading 300 million people in India to seek the unification of India and to seek India's freedom and independence. The Provisional Government is the vanguard of the official government of free India. The Allied nations of Greater East Asia have recognized the Provisional Government. In the recent Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, all Allied nations pledged to fully support India's independence. The freedom of the Indian people is imminent. Today, we welcome Bose, the Indian revolutionary leader who is a revolutionary comrade. We hope to achieve our common goal as soon as possible, overthrow Anglo-American imperialism, and build a Greater East Asia where we can coexist and prosper together."</p>
<p>Bose's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "Today, I feel very sorry that I cannot speak to you in my national language. Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome from the Mayor, officials, and all of you. I am truly unable to express my gratitude with mere words. I see Shanghai today as a unified Shanghai, and this is something to be celebrated. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen, Shanghai is fully implementing the future of China, and soon it will be completely unified. We revolutionaries take construction as our motto. The necessary war is for construction and revitalization. If anyone asks who hopes for China's unification, I will say decisively that it is Japan. On the contrary, it is Britain and America. We currently have a new task and a common goal, which is to hope that all the nations of Greater East Asia will rise together and unite. If China can achieve unification and liberation, then India can also achieve freedom, independence, and liberation, because the two are interconnected. Every Indian hopes for China's unification. I am a friend of China, and I wish China success in establishing permanent peace and cooperation in the construction of Greater East Asia. On behalf of the Indian government and the Indian people, I extend my gratitude to you."</p>
<p>Indian Community Meeting</p>
<p>The five thousand Indian expatriates in Shanghai, in order to enthusiastically welcome the visit of Chairman Bose of the motherland's government, gathered at the Jinmen Hotel at 4 p.m. yesterday (the 21st) to pay their respects to Chairman Bose. Then, at 4:30 p.m., they gathered at the Grand Theater to hold a welcome rally for the Indian expatriate community. In addition to Chairman Bose himself, Lieutenant Colonel N. G. Swamy, Secretary Hassan, and the head of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League also attended. Mayor Chen and Director of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Hirota, also attended, and the meeting started on time. After the ceremony was conducted, everyone sang the Indian national anthem and observed a moment of silence. First, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches from the head of the director, and the Director of the Daily News. Finally, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India delivered a speech. At the end, representatives of the Indian expatriates presented Chairman Bose with flowers and a military sword, with emotions running high. The meeting concluded with shouts of "Long Live Indian Independence."</p>
<p>Hirota's Speech</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Mr. Hirota, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, stated in his speech at the Grand Theater yesterday afternoon, at the Indian community's welcome rally for Bose, that "the united front organized by the people of East Asia to oppose Britain and America is our guarantee of ultimate victory. The Free Indian Army, with this confidence in victory, can advance towards New Delhi to liberate your motherland from British tyranny." Hirota also congratulated the Indian people on the excellent opportunity they have now, and "forcefully stated that India is about to rise up against Britain, which has long oppressed the Indian people. In the past, Indian people have repeatedly attempted to free hundreds of millions of people from the shackles of the British, resulting in the blood of many loyal patriots. Their grievances can be avenged today. You can get the full assistance of the Japanese army and advance towards New Delhi to obtain the freedom and independence you have long desired. You can absolutely trust Japan and the Japanese people, who are brave and fearless and will never retreat in order to realize their ideals. They will assist you everywhere to overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. Your struggle for freedom is not an isolated battle. Japan and other countries in East Asia are fighting alongside you, and this alone is a guarantee of your absolute victory. Indian patriots, following the wise leadership of Chairman Bose, are marching towards victory. Support the Chairman with your lives and blood, and you will surely receive my sympathy and support, which is also the sympathy and support of the entire Japanese people."</p>
<h3 id="e19">Seventh Phase of Household Oil Rationing; Universal Sale Expected by the End of the Month; Sales Price Still Being Adjusted <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The seventh phase of household oil rationing in the city will continue to be handled by the Oil and Fat Professional Committee. 600 tons of edible oil have been shipped to Shanghai and are expected to be rationed around the end of this month. The rationing method is as follows: residents in districts 1-8 can purchase the oil with oil purchase certificates. Residents in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts will continue to purchase the oil from designated oil stores according to past methods. The quantity remains at four ounces per person, and the price is still being adjusted by the authorities.</p>
<p>Household Oil Rationing Will Not Be Interrupted</p>
<p>According to the Thai Duzhi Bao, the Oil and Grain Committee under the General Commercial Control Association has taken decisive steps to stabilize the edible oil supply and has begun to implement them. The First Public Office can announce the sale of household oil within this week. Every Chinese resident can purchase the oil with the first phase of oil purchase certificates issued by the former Engineering Office in February of this year. According to their explanation, there is no reason for the long-term interruption of household oil rationing, and they guarantee that it will not be interrupted. The implementation period has arrived. At the same time, they believe that the quantity purchased from retailers with the first phase of oil purchase certificates is sufficient to meet the needs of residents. The authorities have decided to continuously implement the household oil rationing system, because the raw materials for oil production are being shipped from abroad in a steady stream.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Chairman Bose Meets with Reporters <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Delivers Speech: East Asians Must Achieve Two Things: China's Unification and India's Liberation</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, Subhas Chandra Bose, met with reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers in the city at 2 p.m. yesterday at the Cathay Hotel, 8th floor. Chairman Bose attended the meeting on time, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel N. G. Swamy and Secretary Hassan. Also present were the head of the intelligence department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi, the director of the intelligence section of the Shanghai Office, Mr. Hirota, the head of the army reporting department, Major Izubuchi, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Lieutenant Sakamoto, Captain Nagashima of the fleet reporting department, Director Liang Xiuyu of the municipal propaganda office, Dai Zhenjiang, the chief secretary of the Xin Kai Joint Association, Ren Yunting, and the head of the information department in Shanghai, Mr. Korth. First, Chairman Bose gave a speech on his participation in the Greater East Asia Conference and his feelings about this trip. He then answered questions raised by the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign reporters in detail, which lasted for half an hour.</p>
<p>Bose's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Bose first expressed his gratitude for the welcome from the political and news circles in Shanghai, saying that he had worked in the Indian news industry for many years, so he was very pleased with the work of the reporters. He then said that he attended the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo as an observer and was deeply impressed. The Greater East Asia Conference symbolized that the work of building Greater East Asia had actually begun. He declared at the Greater East Asia Conference that the principles contained in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration were the only principles for building a new order in East Asia, and the impact would not only affect East Asia, but the whole world would also be affected, as the prelude to building a new world order. The two things that East Asians must achieve in the future are: first, the full unification of China, and second, the liberation of India. Regarding China's unification, we must first seek peace between the Chinese and Japanese people. Although China and Japan have had disagreements from time to time in the past, these things have become the past, and now it is possible. China's unification is not only a blessing for China, but also a blessing for India. Gandhi stated before entering prison that the Sino-Japanese incident could increase the war machine of the East Asian people against Britain and America. He continued: India's liberation war has received the support of the countries of East Asia. From a revolutionary standpoint, the prerequisites for success have been obtained. He predicted that the winter counteroffensive propagated by Britain and America would be difficult to succeed, and there was a possibility of being driven out of India! However, India's liberation war is not easy, and the Indian people must prepare for a long-term war, but at the same time, they must have the determination to win.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Welcoming Jiangtela Bose <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Xiao</p>
<p>The leader of the Provisional Government of Free India, Jiangtela Bose, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st) by plane from Tokyo after visiting Nanjing.</p>
<p>Before our eyes, we see the jubilation of the Indian people. This is probably the first time that the Indians living in Shanghai have been so happy! Since they came to Shanghai, they have often been manipulated by the British and Americans, acting as their running dogs. They have tried to stand up on their own several times. But they could not withstand the blow from Britain and America and fell again, until today. However, now, the nations of Greater East Asia are liberated, and the leader of Free India, Bose, has come to Shanghai. The Indian people are ecstatic. We believe that the joy of the Indian people today will accumulate permanently in the future.</p>
<p>Bose appeared in Zhaonan in early July. In the past four months, he has been traveling between Thailand, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula, without a moment to spare. His efforts have been rewarded, and he attended the Greater East Asia Conference as a leader of the liberation of Greater East Asian nations. For 170 years, whether as the supreme crown of the British colonial overlord or as the milch cow of the British Empire, sometimes as laborers and soldiers for Britain, what India has contributed to Britain is innumerable. However, the evil deeds that Britain has repaid India are often criticized even by the British themselves, and it is impossible to list them all. In Britain's view, India is the center of the British colonial empire. Therefore, Bose's declaration of independence on Zhaonan Island was a fatal blow to Britain. India has been plunged into an unprecedented famine because of Britain's policy of division. But British dignitaries have stood idly by, offering no assistance. If they recall what they have done to the Indian people in the past 170 years, then what is happening today is naturally to be expected.</p>
<p>Britain Has Suffered Two Blows</p>
<p>Since becoming the overlord of the modern colonial movement, Britain has suffered two fatal blows to date. One is the independence of the United States, and the other is the independence of India this time. Although the independence of the two is different in nature, they are the same in terms of the enormous impact on all mankind. The thirteen states of the United States openly declared independence from Britain and entered a state of decisive battle. Britain had already received a major lesson on human liberation at that time, but it still indulged in the exploitation of colonies. At the time of American independence, it loudly called for the freedom of the Indian people to Britain, but now Britain and the United States have become birds of a feather. They have united against East Asia and engaged in a decisive battle. The abused (the US) and the abuser (Britain) have become kindred spirits. The American Declaration of Independence states:</p>
<p>"All men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Omission) That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."</p>
<p>That is how the United States became independent. The current situation in India is even more profound than that of the United States at that time. In this sense, India's independence is natural. Moreover, India's independence is a natural sequence.</p>
<p>The reasons for independence have been stated above, but when we compare the independence of India with the independence of the United States, we find a great difference. That is race. The difference between colored people and white people.</p>
<p>Bose's Passionate Broadcast</p>
<p>Judging from the phrase "Asia is one family," Bose also seemed to agree in his passionate forty-minute broadcast to Chongqing at the guesthouse on the 20th.</p>
<p>Among the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia, China and India are not yet fully independent. Therefore, our fervent hope for Bose's independence movement gives great inspiration to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>When it comes to Asia's independence, Bose declares that "first, China must be unified, and second, India must be free." And the ones hindering China's unification are Britain and America. Japan, which Chongqing says is hindering China's unification, is already hoping for the solidarity of East Asia.</p>
<p>Chongqing is still resisting without the name of resistance. As the only alien element in East Asia, it is leaving behind eternal regrets.</p>
<p>Bose said: "Who are you fighting against?" The more you continue to resist, the more you fall into the trap of Britain and America, and the greater your debt becomes." "For the sake of the selfish instincts of Britain and America, you end up being food for them." "If the Chinese people want unification, it can be achieved within twenty-four hours." "But the unification that brings happiness and prosperity to the Chinese people cannot be achieved with the help of Britain and America."</p>
<p>With the tears of half a lifetime fighting against Britain, Bose passionately called on Chongqing to reflect!</p>
<p>Hearing these words, we can know that India now has even more profound reasons for independence than the United States at the time of its independence. At this stage, India's independence is really discovering India's position as a link in the liberation of the Asian nations. In this sense, Bose's broadcast to Chongqing has a very profound significance.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have read the Central News Agency report in your newspaper on the 17th, which states that the temporary rules for entrusting the district map chiefs in the city area have been approved, and that the map chiefs should act as witnesses for land transactions. This is not in accordance with the facts. The temporary rules are currently being reviewed by the Finance and Land Administration Bureaus of the Municipal Government. Before the incident, the transfer of real estate in this city only required the parties involved to fill out an application form at the bureau.

<p>Since the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange opened on the 8th of this month, the trading of Chinese stocks has been limited to cash transactions with next-day delivery. It is reported that the telephone line has been installed in the market, and in order to promote business, it is planned to resume afternoon trading and implement a new "cash on delivery" system. The "cash on delivery" system means that for the Chinese stocks traded every day, the settlement will be made every Monday, and the previous next-day delivery system will be abolished. For example, customers who buy or sell stocks can temporarily not pay or deliver the goods until the following Monday when the settlement is completed. It is said that it has been internally decided to implement it starting today, and the commission paid by the exchange to the brokers will be temporarily collected at 0.0625, and in the future it will be slightly increased to 0.125. However, the commission charged by the brokers to the customers is 0.5%, and the transaction tax is additionally collected at 0.06%. A reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that all sectors hope that the exchange's so-called "cash on delivery" will be carefully considered and implemented, because the so-called "cash on delivery" is similar to a disguised form of spot futures trading, which can easily be manipulated by speculators or create situations such as buying and selling short. It is reported that the exchange has solemnly stated that the exchange is considering the issue of "cash on delivery". If it is implemented, proper measures must be taken in advance to prevent speculation and manipulation and avoid affecting the stock market.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Escorting a Transport Convoy: One of the South Pacific Naval Battles <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The second major victory near Bougainville Island was the second major blow struck by the Japanese Navy after Pearl Harbor during a long period of silence, sinking as many as twenty-four enemy warships and vessels to the bottom of the South Pacific! This major victory was entirely due to the efforts of the officers and men who worked day and night on aircraft, torpedo boats, and resupply operations.</p>
<p>Departure of the Merchant Convoy</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] The merchant convoy was scheduled to depart at 00:00. Our ship, acting as a patrol vessel, departed first, raising signal flags and directing several anti-submarine patrol boats to leave the harbor. The South Pacific [Location redacted] Base. Our naval aircraft patrolled the sea. At 00:00, the convoy formed into a defensive formation and began a zigzag pattern. On the bridge of the escort vessels, in the command post, and on the conning tower, the watch was set up. A sickle-shaped crescent moon peeked through the clouds. Due to the enemy submarines’ activity both day and night, the number of lookouts was increased from [Number redacted] to [Number redacted]. The recent enemy submarine activity was just as the lookouts had said: “Five minutes before moonrise,” “Five minutes before sunrise,” appearing and disappearing as the color of the sea surface changed. This merchant convoy was carrying many southern resources. If these resources could safely reach our country, they would be fully loaded with war materials for the first line of battle. Now was a time when not a single merchant ship could be allowed to sink. How important was the responsibility of the escort vessels!</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] “Prepare for aerial defense!” Just after 11:00 on the [Number redacted] day, this order was suddenly heard. Five enemy bombers were approaching to attack our convoy. At that time, our ship was already sailing at high speed. A white wake appeared, and the ship moved in a rapid curve, beginning to sway from side to side.</p>
<p>“Bearing right thirty degrees, altitude [Number redacted] thousand!”</p>
<p>The command post’s order was clear. Rat-tat-tat… Rat-tat-tat… the guns fired at the enemy planes, and at the same time, the enemy planes dropped bombs. The enemy’s bombs fell around the convoy, landing in the sea, and our ships’ bows moved forward calmly in the water spray. The enemy planes, fearing the firepower of our escort vessels, could not fly directly over the ships. They only dropped bombs and flew away.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your valiant fight!”</p>
<p>Each merchant ship raised this signal flag.</p>
<p>Sinking an Enemy Submarine</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] The northward route became increasingly winding. That night, our ship’s lookout spotted an enemy submarine surfaced in the rain.</p>
<p>“Prepare for anti-submarine defense!”</p>
<p>The enemy submarine surfaced unexpectedly, no more than [Number redacted] meters from our ship. Seeing our ship, it panicked and hastily submerged.</p>
<p>“Ready!” “Hard a starboard!”</p>
<p>“Begin depth charge attack!”</p>
<p>Soon, the sound of explosions rang out in the sea.</p>
<p>“Confirmed!” “Confirmed!”</p>
<p>The officers and the captain spoke confidently.</p>
<p>“The convoy is safe!”</p>
<p>The convoy continued its voyage silently, unharmed.</p>
<p>Stormy Weather</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] From daybreak, the waves surged, and the ship shook. The weather report indicated a risk of a typhoon.</p>
<p>“Prepare for the storm!” the order came.</p>
<p>Double and triple ropes were hung on the motor launch. Ropes were also stretched across the deck for use when moving around. The shelves and chairs in the officers’ room were also tied down to prevent them from shaking. Just after noon, a strong wind rose, and the waves were higher than the ship’s side, obscuring the horizon. However, our convoy’s ears and eyes remained sharp. According to intelligence from a submarine, an enemy submarine was reported to be forty miles from our convoy. Before nightfall, the submarine circled the convoy once and positioned itself ahead of the convoy. The waves grew higher and higher, and the ship sailed as if in the middle of a mountain range, in a valley thousands of feet deep. From 4:00 AM, the low-pressure line of the barometer began to drop sharply at a right angle, dropping 731 millibars in an hour. The waves became triangular, the wind speed was ten meters per second, and the electric wires and flag ropes whistled. The convoy was shrouded in thick fog, and nothing could be seen. The triangular waves crashed against the bottom of the ship. It didn’t feel like seawater.</p>
<p>“Intelligence came in that there was a submarine, and a typhoon struck just as we were about to pass through dangerous waters. It’s a divine wind! The submarine definitely can’t surface.”</p>
<p>The [Rank redacted] soldier in the command post said this.</p>
<p>“The weather is changing! The weather is changing!”</p>
<p>The lookout in a black raincoat shouted, his eyes glued to his binoculars.</p>
<p>Torpedoes Arrive After the Typhoon</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] Around 6:00 AM, we passed through the center of the typhoon. Seawater hit the ship’s deck and flowed to the flag deck. It was a terrible typhoon.</p>
<p>“What will happen to the convoy?”</p>
<p>The captain said, “We can break through the typhoon circle after noon. We have already instructed the convoy to gather at [Number redacted] degrees after passing through the typhoon.”</p>
<p>Our ship discovered two merchant ships after passing through the center of the typhoon. But because of the headwind and high waves, it was like descending from the top of a mountain to the desolate sea, approaching the merchant ships. The merchant ships were the [Number redacted] and [Number redacted] ships of the convoy.</p>
<p>“The whereabouts of the other merchant ships are unknown.”</p>
<p>The two merchant ships responded with signal flags. Our ship escorted these two ships to the gathering point at [Number redacted] degrees. The typhoon passed, and the waves gradually subsided. Suddenly, a thudding sound was heard from the [Number redacted] ship.</p>
<p>“Torpedo attack!”</p>
<p>In a split second, our ship’s propeller rotated to full speed, and it turned sharply towards the place where the sound came from. Depth charges dropped from the stern of our ship detonated in the sea.</p>
<p>“Is that a torpedo?”</p>
<p>The soldiers laughed loudly inside the ship. Because our ship was there, it couldn’t have been a torpedo attack. In that situation, a ship like ours, fully loaded with gunpowder and heavy artillery, was more dangerous than a merchant ship.</p>
<p>Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>[Month and Day redacted] The sea gradually calmed down. After the calm, the anti-submarine patrol had to be even more vigilant. The lookouts stared intently at the sea. Just then, the position of several submarines was discovered, closing in on our convoy.</p>
<p>“Prepare for anti-submarine defense!”</p>
<p>Our ship used signals to inform the convoy of the position of the submarines and sped towards that direction. The enemy submarines fired seven torpedoes in a fan shape towards the convoy. The pale white trails, like several belts, were faintly visible on the sea surface. Our merchant ships skillfully evaded them. Two timed torpedoes exploded behind the convoy. We dropped depth charges towards the submarines where the torpedoes had been fired.</p>
<p>“The enemy has submerged. The outer hull is probably broken, and seawater is flooding into the ship, sinking it to the bottom of the sea! Or perhaps the electrical equipment is damaged, and it can’t move. Most of them are buried in the fish’s belly,” the electrician laughed. Thus, from departing from [Location redacted] on [Date redacted], for [Number redacted] days, thanks to the tireless activity of the escort ships, the convoy returned safely to [Location redacted] port.

<h3 id="e33">Blitzkrieg Triumph: Destroy Ten Enemy Ships in Five Minutes <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Eliminating obstacles and destroying the enemy along the way, the battlefield of the South Pacific, where the fruits of victory are gradually becoming clear, makes people deeply feel that "the great war is behind us!" Detailed reports of the glorious air battle over the waters of Bougainville Island continue to arrive, and amid the enemy’s blind bombing and the explosion of anti-aircraft shells, the reporter hastily recorded the following account of the attack by a member of the dive bomber squadron who participated in the attack that day.</p>
<p>Ready and Waiting</p>
<p>The dive bomber squadron and the fighter squadron received orders to sortie on the morning of November 8th. They had been waiting for an opportunity to attack, but there were no convoys to attack, and they were lamenting that their heroism was going unused when they received a report that a large convoy had appeared near the enemy’s landing point on Bougainville Island. The crew members rushed to their planes, ready to "blow them to smithereens!" At this [Location redacted] air base, the rainy season was approaching, and the heat was extreme. For more than ten days, there hadn’t even been a drizzle. The weeds growing on the vast airfield were scorched by the sun. When the engines of the formation aircraft started spinning, a cloud of dust was immediately kicked up, making it impossible to open one’s mouth or eyes. It was as if a heavy smoke screen was being spread. Amidst this sky-obscuring smoke, the dive bombers, clutching [Number redacted] kg bombs, took off one every few seconds.</p>
<p>Embarking on the Journey</p>
<p>The bomber squadron and the escorting fighter squadron, filling the sky above the base, spread their wings and set off in formation. Everyone was filled with ambition. It was a powerful surprise attack by a large mixed formation of fighters and bombers! Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, the time passed quickly. Captain H, leading the [Number redacted] squadron, led [Number redacted] dive bombers forward, flying towards the skies where the enemy convoy was located. Fortunately, the weather was clear. Through the gaps in the broken clouds floating under the wings, one could see the calm, blue sea. At an altitude of [Number redacted], the needle on the speedometer pointed to [Number redacted] and remained still. The engine roared, and the propeller spun rapidly. In the distance to the left, the giant form of Bougainville Island could be seen through the broken clouds. Mount Balbi, over three thousand meters high, was faintly visible among the clouds. After another [Number redacted] minutes, we arrived at the battlefield. Looking around, the following planes in formation maintained a magnificent formation. The fighter squadron suddenly reduced speed and flew down to the northeast at full speed, their sharp eyes flashing, on the alert for enemy aircraft. Five, ten minutes passed, and suddenly a loud voice came through the speaking tube from the spotter: “There, enemy convoy!” Indeed, below the left wing, near Torokina off the enemy’s landing point on Bougainville Island, there were patrol boats, destroyers, and X number of transport ships, traveling north at a speed of fifteen knots under strict escort.</p>
<p>Launching the Attack</p>
<p>The escorting fighter squadron suddenly left the formation and flew down to the northeast at full speed. Looking over, enemy fighter planes in various formations were rushing towards the bomber squadron from among the clouds. “Here they come!” While thinking this, they began to dive, leaving the enemy fighters to be dealt with by the friendly defense aircraft. The bombers broke through the clouds and pointed their noses towards the sea from an altitude of [Number redacted] meters. In an instant, the enemy’s defensive fire erupted. The enemy convoy’s high-angle guns and pom-pom guns fired furiously. Suddenly, the sky turned dark, and a barrage of shells surrounded the bomber squadron. Bright red tracer bullets flashed through the barrage, dazzling the eyes. The attacking crew members gritted their teeth, widened their bloodshot eyes, and began their masterpiece of dive bombing. Ships in the bombing squadron caught fire. Some listed to the left and right, about to sink; some were running at full speed, trying to escape. In an instant, the calm sea turned into a hellish scene of wailing ghosts and screaming demons. The following squadrons continued to attack relentlessly. There were also friendly planes that were hit directly by enemy defensive fire while pulling up after dropping their bombs and self-detonated. There were also planes that were dive bombed again after enemy fighters stole through the gaps between the friendly fighters. Thus, the extremely fierce, do-or-die attack was completed in five minutes. Three enemy destroyers and four transport ships sank in an instant; two cruisers and one transport ship were damaged; fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down. Thus, the fighter-bomber mixed attack squadron returned triumphantly to the [Number redacted] base.</p>
<p>Singing Triumphantly</p>
<p>The moon on the tenth day shone like silver in the blue sky. The southwest horizon was filled with cumulus clouds, thunder rumbled, and the clouds flashed, but it didn’t rain. The setting sun still shone with a strong red light, and the earth was like fire. When the dive bomber squadron, escorted by fighters, returned to the skies above the base, another attack squadron was preparing to depart, as a force including combat ships was reported to be sailing northward forty-five nautical miles southwest of Bougainville Island.

<h3 id="e34">News of Victory Comes from the Air Raid Shelter <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>That night, we walked into the air raid shelter, the shrill sound of the enemy twin-engine bombers between the layers of [redacted], and the deafening roar of the friendly high [redacted] and the sound of launching, it was simply impossible to breathe.</p>
<p>Danger, Danger</p>
<p>"It's falling!" Someone whispered. In an instant, suddenly felt the shaking of the earth. Illuminated by searchlights from all directions. And the anti-aircraft guns, like fireworks, continuously exploded around it, the enemy plane was probably blindly dropping bombs again, just like what [redacted] had done. On the hillside behind, there was a sudden explosion, and a blast [redacted] probably the attack group of several planes that had come down to strafe with machine guns." I was thinking this. Unexpectedly, with one hand waving an empty cigarette box, he happily said to the officer:</p>
<p>"The accurate results of the Bougainville Island naval battle are now clear, and I'm here to report them to you."</p>
<p>This sentence. Instantly made everyone in the shelter forget the enemy planes above their heads, filled with joy and excitement, their chests filled to the brim.</p>
<p>In the twilight of the seventh day, a urgent telegram came from a reconnaissance plane, saying that a large mobile unit centered on four enemy warships had been discovered near the Cape Torokina off Bougainville Island, [redacted] was immediately filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>Thus, on the dawn of the eighth day, we stood outside the dormitory to send off the warriors. The roaring engine, shaking like a [redacted], sounded overhead, flying south. The signal lights of the fighter planes and bombers, proudly [redacted], shone in the starry sky of dawn, gradually disappearing towards the horizon. I waved my hat, devoutly silently [redacted] success in this trip.</p>
<p>Two hours, three hours—time passed slowly in anxiety. In the [redacted] sunlight, we stood among the coconut trees, [redacted] the distant southern sky, waiting for [redacted] Hawaii [redacted] [redacted] the enemy's large fleet that had not been there since the head.</p>
<p>In the Sound of Great Victory</p>
<p>It was already [redacted] o'clock, and we waved our hats frantically again at the blue sky, welcoming the large formation that had set out in the morning. When the black dots of the formation appeared on the horizon, our hearts [redacted] jumped to our throats. However, one hour, two hours, several more anxious hours passed, and still not much news of the battle came from the distant airfield. Walking into the street, the soldiers I met all asked, "Reporting team, is the result of the battle still unknown?" Later, news came of two warships sunk, four warships bombed, and all kinds of other information, but it was not accurate. However, everyone believed that [redacted] must be the only result since Pearl Harbor, so everyone raised their glasses to celebrate [redacted].</p>
<p>Since Sergeant Major's news was the telegram that was about to be quoted, of course it would not be wrong. With this premise, quietly listened to him reporting loudly:</p>
<p>"Three battleships sunk, two cruisers (bombed), three destroyers, four transport ships, one herbivorous ship caught fire and was badly damaged, three or more large cruisers were badly damaged, three cruisers and large destroyers were also on fire and badly damaged, and one large transport ship was on fire and badly damaged, and twelve enemy planes. This is the part that has been ascertained so far, plus what will be ascertained later." (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, November 17th)</p>

<p>— Ru Zhijuan</p>
<p>Who says life is hard?</p>
<p>A few small words in the want ad section, "A certain fashion company is hiring several female employees," reflecting in Qinhen’s tired eyes, are as big as a rice bowl. She changed into her most fashionable blue cotton cheongsam as quickly as possible. Her ordinary face in the mirror was flashing. The door slammed. She grabbed her college diploma, which she had obtained with years of brainpower and effort, and, harboring a hopeful heart, rushed out of her kitchen.</p>
<p>In the gentle autumn breeze, Qinhen finally squeezed into the group of gaudily dressed girls. The cloying fragrance of powder drilled straight into her nostrils. She barely managed to get to the office to make contact. One hand held her diploma, and the other didn't know where to put itself. The muscles on her face tightened. Taking unnaturally strange steps, she walked to the desk in the center and saw a middle-aged man with a fat head and big ears sitting opposite her. Several people dressed in Western suits were also sitting on the sofas around the room, their sharp eyes scanning her body. The questions vibrated in her ears. She answered awkwardly. Disappointment gradually permeated Qinhen’s heart, slowly climbing onto her ordinary face. On the bright floor, her blurred shadow was moving towards the door. Raising her head slightly, she saw a dazzling bouquet of flowers coming towards her.</p>
<p>The office door closed gently. In the crack of the door, was the man sitting in the center nodding to the gardener named Cai Daoyun?</p>
<p>Who says life is hard?</p>
<p>A long street stretched out in front of Qinhen. She wandered in the gentle autumn breeze, wandering, wandering…</p>
<p>The kitchen door slammed shut, hitting the wall. The oval-shaped scale hanging on the wall also trembled incessantly. Qinhen’s ordinary face flashed again in the swaying mirror.</p>
<p>The newspaper lying still on the table remained motionless. The small words printed on it, "A certain fashion company is hiring female employees…" Below were even smaller words, "Must have high moral character and refined appearance…" They gradually grew larger in Qinhen’s eyes, growing larger… The diploma for a rice bowl was torn into two pieces. A series of "chi chi chi" sounds. It had become dozens of small white butterflies, flying proudly in the air, as if mocking its mistress.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Opening of the West Tsing Basketball Tournament Tonight - Analysis of the Strengths of Group A Teams - The Giant Team is Ambitious, Hoping the Chinese Teams Will Strive for More Than Just the Championship and Focus on Sportsmanship <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The current Four Tsing Basketball Tournament will open tonight (the 22nd). This time, there are twelve teams participating in Group A and as many as forty-two teams in Group B. It can be said that it is a general mobilization of basketball teams in Shanghai, and one can foresee a grand occasion on the banks of the Rue Brenier. Taking advantage of this pre-opening, this article records past events, hoping that each team will adopt them. It also provides an analysis of the strengths of each team in Group A as a reference for fans! One of the important aspects of a basketball team is excellent difficulty, which is also a hidden worry for the Chinese teams. What is lacking is the patience to perform; it is by no means a random coincidence. Winners of past championships have their own conditions! The main points are: the team members must have abundant energy, pure and skilled techniques, cooperation within each team, and constant changes in strategies during combat, with precise adjustments before changes. After the game, research should be conducted on collecting winning points. In addition, it is more important to obey the coach and maintain the same spirit throughout. If this can be achieved, a wonderful performance can be presented, and the true meaning of sports can be understood. However, observing the teams in Shanghai, many only decide on personnel close to the opening date, which inevitably leads to suspicions of being a hastily assembled group, and they all lack good coaches, often leading to situations where success or failure depends on a single opportunity, which is very regrettable. Therefore, the reporter humbly offers some suggestions, hoping that each team will not regard them as clichés and will repeatedly consider my words, then it will not be difficult to achieve better results, how fortunate! Now, a brief analysis of the strengths of each team in Group A is as follows:</p>
<p>Giant Team – In the trial matches, its achievements were somewhat noticeable, defeating various teams one after another. Although this cannot be used to make a final judgment, its advantages are quite noteworthy. The entire team is strong, and its man-to-man marking is quite effective. Playing at home gives it an advantage. Its offensive guards use blocking tactics to attack, and it utilizes its tall player, Funic, who stands under the opponent's basket to await follow-up opportunities. I still remember how the pirate Ryan also used this to defeat others, making him a dangerous figure. Moreover, with the command of Kevin Love from the middle, the entire team advances and retreats very quickly. A victory.</p>
<p>Central North Team – It adopts a five-man zone defense. Because the team members are all veterans, their performance is still brilliant. However, the team's scoring keys, Lan Xuechong and Shen Fenggong, sometimes act as they please, and when they don't, they are completely clueless. Therefore, success or failure often depends on the team's luck on the day. And its only shortcoming is that the reporter always feels that their play is not seamless. Lan Xuechong is accustomed to using man-to-man marking, which sometimes leads to conflicting performances. In short, the team believes that it is still a promising team.</p>
<p>Ren Yu Team – Its only advantage is that its players have the best physiques, which is worth mentioning. Its tactics are particularly tight in defense and use high speed in attack. Unfortunately, its players are short in stature, which is a significant disadvantage. This year, it is cooperating with the Bing team, and its two forwards are using new players, which should be surprising. We will wait and see!</p>
<p>Hua Lian Team – Its players are average in talent and are all strong enough. It adopts man-to-man tactics and shows considerable skill. The entire team has had several years of silent understanding, and its coordination is pure and skilled. Unfortunately, it is passionate but also reckless, and prone to committing fouls. If it can overcome this point, it can reach the pinnacle of perfection, keep striving!</p>
<p>Monaco – It is a team promoted from Group B. Its tactics are the same as the Giant team. The entire team revolves around the black player Curry, who is good at learning from others' strengths to compensate for his own weaknesses, but lacks experience.</p>
<p>Hua Ying Team – It is composed of film industry employees who are active in the basketball scene in their limited spare time and are listed as a Group A team, which is truly commendable. General opinion predicts that it will be at the bottom of the pack, but watching its trial matches, it seemed to defeat the Giant team in the first half, so it should not be underestimated. Its characteristic is absolute obedience to the coach. Its game time is often the same as filming time. Therefore, its exquisite five players may not be able to attend every game, which is a shortcoming that cannot be compensated for. In the reporter's opinion, the team's performance can be in the middle.</p>
<p>Eastern and Amateur – Both are incarnations of the Paramount Ballroom. Eastern has Du Bensheng joining the team, assisted by Bao Songyuan, plus Zhang Shaoqing, Wang Jinghu, and Guo Qichang, a famous general newly arrived from Qingdao. Amateur has Xiang Long, A Kui, Zhou Zhi, and Tao Shaosheng and He Xiaoguang from the Red Team. Both teams adopt man-to-man tactics. A slight disadvantage is that their physical strength is not sufficient, but looking back at their glorious war record in the Four Tsing Tournaments, it is not difficult to achieve good results.</p>
<p>Hua Nan and Tong Ren – Both are brother teams, and their cooperation has the beauty of butterflies dancing among flowers. It can be described as light, fast, and pleasing. Hua Nan is especially good. Its forward Hu Jinkui's floor skills are similar to Feng Nianhua's, so although Hua Nan's performance cannot be among the best, it has several wonderful highlights that can be enjoyed. Tong Ren's players are short in stature, which causes injuries. They can't measure distances well and can't get the ball under the basket. Everything depends on floor passes, which is really difficult. Nature is unfavorable, what can be done?</p>
<p>Da Hua and San Lun – Da Hua was organized by Shen Ji'en and others. It has its own court on Da Dian Road, hence the name. The team's coordination is still good, but it rarely faces strong enemies, and it often panics and becomes disorganized. With a few days of strict training, it can become a capable team. San Lun is composed of former Fudan veterans Ren An and Xiang Rui. Due to their lack of physical strength, they adopt man-to-man marking, which is extremely disadvantageous. Moreover, their will is not unified. That's all for their battles! (Jie)</p>
<p>[P&gt;Group A Football League Strength Divided, Dong Lian and Police Form a Triumvirate, Portuguese Merchants and Overseas Chinese Still Have Potential, Jewish and Three Provinces a Step Behind&lt;P]</p>
<p>There is still one game left in the Group A Football League, the Police vs. Overseas Chinese match, which the reporter has already written about. There were three performances yesterday and the day before yesterday, and I have recorded them. It is not difficult to follow the clues!</p>
<p>Dong Hua Easily Defeats Jewish – Played at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM on the 20th (yesterday). Although it was known that it would be a one-sided situation, the enthusiastic audience still braved the biting wind, which shows the love for Dong Hua.</p>
<p>This year, Dong Hua's military strength has been greatly strengthened with the return of Tan Fuzhen, Sun Jinshun, Zhang Lin'gen, and Zhou Ji, and there is hope for a championship. Jewish's main general, Tuofu, is absent, so it was predicted that it would be one-sided. However, it was not easy for the "dark horse" Jewish to score two goals.</p>
<p>Dong Hua's attack still retains its characteristic of short passes, which is captivating. Dai Maisun in the middle has considerable coordination, and the activity on both wings utilizes effective wing passes and accurate crosses! It can be said to be perfect. Lao Tan's versatility can be compared to Song Lingsheng. Lin Gen, Long Hai, and Shu Tang's experience has solidified the defense. The defense of Zhuang and Li Zi should be impeccable, but Zhou Ji is still inexperienced.</p>
<p>What I feel is lacking is that Long Hai has just recovered from a new illness and his strength is still insufficient. Lin Gen sometimes pushes too far forward and sometimes falls too far back, but fortunately, his broad physique can still cover his shortcomings. If he can stand his position well, he may become a good midfielder.</p>
<p>The new players on both wings are worth discussing. Wang Xisheng has more than enough running ability, is also alert, and his crosses are impressive. In this battle, he provided Lao Sun with three appropriate balls, allowing Lao Sun to display his wonderful long-range shots. He can be considered a successful masterpiece. What is lacking is that he hesitates in excellent scoring positions! Li Yao on the left wing can be said to be a good talent at a time when Shanghai lacks such talents. His speed and power of passing have reached a considerable level. What is especially commendable is his extremely skillful ability to score goals. Some fans say that he is gradually showing arrogance. The reporter sincerely hopes that Li will correct it if he has it, and encourage himself if he doesn't, and place high hopes on him!</p>
<p>Jewish's performance was not as disorganized as ideal. In difficult circumstances, they always shook in the past and scored two goals. Lai Zhe and Wen Tuo are strong and sharp, but the team's overall technical level is poor and it is not difficult to lose momentum. Their collection is also appropriate!</p>
<p>Lianyi Defeats Three Provinces by a Large Margin</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan, facing south, the sunlight was full, and watching the ball was very comfortable.</p>
<p>Lianyi's offensive was like a hot knife through butter, winning with an overwhelming score of ten to one, which was not expected. Before the game, Li Yichen was absent, and everyone thought that Lianyi would win without dispute, but it would inevitably be a hard fight. Unexpectedly, the Three Provinces team also had strong players absent, and the enemy was vulnerable.</p>
<p>Lianyi's scorers were Yuan Yongfu with three goals, Sun Jiaohao with two goals, Gao Baosheng, Song Louheng, Fei Chun, and Yu Nidai with one goal each, and an own goal from Three Provinces, totaling ten goals. Taking this battle blood as a lesson, Lianyi's difficulty lies in responding to changes at will under the excellent and relaxed conditions, and the performance seems to have no gaps. Therefore, we have to make a plan for it!</p>
<p>Yichen is said to have followed his father-in-law's instructions and will no longer run on the field, so Yong is now assigned to the forward position. Although he is lively, his shooting ability is not as good as Yichen's, so the offensive power is reduced a lot. Moreover, the left wing lacks Jing Jing and Yu Zhengyue are not worthy of important tasks. Qian Lao is arrogant, Yu lacks experience, and A Bu inevitably has moments of leisure. Bao Zheng is too brave and loses his position. Fei Chun also likes to add too much flourish, so there are many worrying points in the offensive power. Moreover, with Yongfu out of the center back line, replaced by Cai Sheng. The difference cannot be measured. The burden on the general will inevitably increase a lot. Therefore, the defense is also greatly strained. The reporter believes that it cannot be determined by a big win, and the future needs to be taken seriously, so there is hope.</p>
<p>The Three Provinces originally came to join Group A to learn from each other. Moreover, with Mr. and Mrs. Pan's vigorous encouragement to pay attention to spirit, borrowing other people's football skills for their own adoption, and using the virtue of spirit to promote the meaning of sports, their deep intentions are admirable. In terms of talent, the rest of the team are all young people. The connection with Xu Hui's comrades is also considerable. The overall lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the routines. Mai Liangsen and Zhou Wenkui's performance has the demeanor of a great general. The right winger Xue Pengkui can shoot from about twenty yards from the baseline, which can be called heroic.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Defeats Portuguese Merchants Yesterday</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants had veteran players such as Costa and Nikola this year and were ambitious. However, they lost to Overseas Chinese by three to five yesterday on the banks of Jiaozhou Road, hurting the spirits of the Portuguese generals!</p>
<p>After Overseas Chinese suffered a major defeat to a police team last week, they decided to reorganize. David Peters played several games, with Victor Tait as the defender and Fafan laughing as the inner forward, and Carol directing the central army. With such a change, the defense and attack are well-balanced, and the team's past style has been restored. Fafan laughed and received someone's guidance, scoring four goals alone. The skills of a general are still extraordinary. Goalkeeper Ivanov's performance was outstanding, saving more than half a dozen dangerous balls. If he were replaced by Boriman, I'm afraid it would be more ominous than auspicious. Looking at the lineup of Portuguese Merchants, it is neat and impressive, and its performance still fully embodies delicate work. Unfortunately, coach Gaines was injured and left the field in the middle of the first half, which was a fatal blow. And Colassa's shots often use high balls, which are suitable for Ivanov's appetite. Great opportunities were lost because of this, which is very regrettable. If he could attack more with low balls, the outcome would not be like this. The entire team is the most ferocious with Oliveira, who advances and defends in an orderly manner. Costa and Schmidt, although experienced, could not stop Fafan from rampaging. How strange!</p>
<p>Looking at the above situation in general, combining the previous battle, the strength of the Group A line is already obvious. Abandoning China, Lianyi, and a surprise, the tripod is set at three. Portuguese Merchants and Overseas Chinese still have some potential, and Jewish and the Three Provinces will inevitably be dwarfed by comparison, competing for the bottom spot. The survival of the fittest is the public law of nature. The emergence of upsets is not due to our inappropriate comments, but to special circumstances (Mei Bixian)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Trivial Records of the Re-Formal Practice of the China Film Women's Basketball Team - Interest Increasing, Skills Improving <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Minzhu said: "The team has considerable time to practice every day, and now it is stipulated that there are two formal practices every week, and Mr. Qian is invited to guide them." Indeed, the interest of the female stars is increasing day by day, which is really a good phenomenon!</p>
<p>The team's second formal practice was on the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The reporter had nothing to do in his spare time, so he was able to appreciate it again. During the practice, Wu Wenchao strictly prohibited outsiders, so the field always appeared quiet. It is said that the special guests on that day were Miss Huang Mingyuan, the captain of the Green Team, and Mr. Xie Yitai, the director of the team, as well as male stars Sun Min, Xi Dui, Nong Liuqiong, Guan Hongzun, and more than ten other people.</p>
<p>The various aspects of the first practice have been mastered within a few days, so this time, the next step is to practice team cooperation. First, try court rotation and passing, rotating like a weaving shuttle, then practice triangular passing, forward dribbling, sudden shot, ground passing, attacking, and other items. This time, the focus is on the attacking aspect. The stars practiced diligently for an hour, and their progress was very rapid. It is said that the next practice is to practice the defensive skills of goalkeepers, and then the team can be divided into competitions. In about a short time, the lively scene of the stars on the court can be seen!</p>
<p>The players who arrived were Wang Danfeng, Wang Xiao, the Hu Feng sisters, Chen Juanjuan, Wu Zengying, Yi Yuejuan, Zhang Min, Feng Feng, and Murong Wan'er, ten red stars in all.</p>
<p>Laughter on the Court</p>
<p>Tong Yuemou came, and everyone called her "Old Mother." During the practice, the old woman, although eating a few pickled radishes, still clenched her teeth and practiced harder and harder. People praised her for having guts! She smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Wang Hu's hat was so big that Sun Min looked a bit like Zhang Fei. Someone nearby said, does Zhang Fei have such rosy lips, white teeth, and a delicate face? Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Juanjuan passed the ball to Hu Feng, slightly heavier. Hu Feng caught it and bounced it on her face. With a sound of "Ouch!" Juanjuan was busy comforting her. Hu endured the pain and forced a smile.</p>
<p>Several photographers took pictures of Wang Danfeng after the practice. One photographer said: Smile a little more. Wang replied, how can I smile if I can't smile? But before she finished speaking, she already had a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Before each practice item, Yue Feng and Tao Ji'ao demonstrated. Yue was short and small, and Tao was slender. From a distance, it was almost impossible to tell the difference between men and women. Everyone laughed (Skinny Rememberer)</p>
