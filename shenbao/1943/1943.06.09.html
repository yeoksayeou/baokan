<h3 id="c1">再論公務員生活問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日趨嚴重的公務員生活問題，對於國家政治與社會風習影響之重大，已不待詳爲申論。而改善公務員生活之必要，及其重要性，似乎也已爲各方面所確認了。目前的問題，是如何改善公務員的生活，是要求具體的辦法，和確切的實施。關於這些問題，我們更作進一步的獻議，亟盼關係當局加以研究，使當前的問題獲得最適當的解決。</p>
<p>第一，根據已往的事實而言，政府有關係當局對於一般公務員生活之困難，可說是相當注意，而且也曾經設法加以改善的，如一再的增加生活津貼的倍數，行政院會議決定物資俸給制度等等。可是，這裏有幾個根本問題必須首先研究改革：（一）是公務員俸給制度的確當與否的問題。一向國家關於公務員俸給的立法，即階級制的俸給制度，一部份繼承了歷朝官吏俸餉的舊例，一部份參照各先進國的制度，但是前者已有時間上的今昔之異，後者則在空間上有國情之別，特別是由於目前世界戰爭之發展，如不就制度上作根本的考慮，那麼，一切「改善」的辦法與措施，就不免與實際懸殊，不能收穫預想的效果。我們所要希望當局作根本考慮者，是要針對戰時的客觀環境（主要是通貨購買力之漸趨低落，物資消耗之增大及其供給量的漸趨减少，物價之必然漸趨高漲），並依據本國及各地區的不同的政治與經濟條件，而定出一種最適時宜的戰時俸給制度。當局決定實施實物俸給制，這不失爲一種好辦法，但必須適時適地而定，求得實際的成效。（二）是公務員加薪的問題。在最適切正確的制度尙未確立以前，爲適應迫急的需要起見，應該先實行增加薪津的臨時辦法。以往所增加的是否實際有裨助於公務人員的生活，頗成問題，這種辦法，自有調整之必要，因爲增加薪津的眞實意義，不是爲了維持當局與部屬之間的情感，而是爲了使公務員不因生活而憂慮，使能專心於奉公服務。如果增加薪津實際上只是有等於無的少數，那不僅不能解決問題，而且在每一個公務員的心理上，投下黑影，反足以降低公務員對政府的威信與對工作的熱忱。因此，我們堅決認爲不言增加薪津則已，旣言增加，就得切實解決公務員生活之實際困難。以上兩點，是改善公務員物質生活的基本原則。</p>
<p>第二，從改善公務員物質生活的方法上說，我們所說的公務人員，是比較的廣義的，即凡是其工作直接或間接是爲着推行國家的政策與法令，及其服務的部門是含有國家性，社會性與公共性的，從政府各種機關，軍隊，警察，文化敎育，以至重要經濟部門的工作人員，依一定的俸給而生活的，都可說是公務人員。由於各種公務人員階級地位的懸殊，由於服務部門及其俸給或薪津的差別，由於各地區及各時期的生活條件之不同，更由於每一公務人員的家庭負擔的不同，改善的辦法，自然不能完全一律。因此，我們所要獻議的，是希望當局採取差別的方法，而其重心則在於眞正的公平的和實際的改善。至於差別的標準，應該是：（一）爲提高行政效率或工作效果計，對於特別重要部門的公務員，對於國家所特別缺乏的專門家及眞正的人材，對於切切實實有工作做而且做得好的，應給予最優越的改善條件，這裏同時含有獎勵專門人材及工作競賽的意義。但其原有物質生活已可維持者，則以給予名譽的優待爲佳，不必增加其薪津。（二）爲了要求改善之切於實際，我們重複的提出依據各地最低生活費指數的辦法。從事實來看，目前各地最低生活費指數，即勞工生活費指數，較諸事變前的民國二十五年，至少已由一〇〇增加至三，三七二以上（依上海工部局去年十一月的指數），實際上在今日當然已有更大的上昇，但是，考諸任何公務員的薪津，幾乎絕無由一〇〇元增加至十倍以上的，我們所說公務員生活之嚴重的焦點，就在這裏，而我們所以主張依物價指數改善公務員生活的方法之理由，也在於此。否則，決不能解決問題！這種增加薪津的比率，也許會增加當局的困難，但是，更切實的說，就使依生活費指數增加薪津，還是不十分澈底的，還永遠是落在生活費的實際數字之後面的，因爲生活費指數之作成已是至少過去一月的實績，而薪津增加率之規定，至少是未來的若干時日甚至一年度！</p>
<p>至於當局增加支出的困難，我們也應有周詳的考慮，但應注意，我們所要求的差別標準，還有以下幾個條件，即（一）舊俸給制及官制原有許多已不合時代及浪費國帑的，在實行普遍的改良公務員待遇之後，這種舊制度當然消滅了，在任何機關及部門內，不准有不辦事而領乾薪的現象，絕對不准有兼職更兼俸或兼職不兼俸而領公費的現象，這樣，就可以撙節一大筆浮費，挹注於增加必要公務員的俸給。（二）增加薪津，主要是對於不能維持最低限度的個人與其家庭生活的公務員而設的，特別是對於中下級公務員，軍人，警察，及敎職員等而設的；至於高級人員，或其家庭擔負較少的，則其增加也應比較的减少。不過，我們可以切實的說，帶了錢來做官的人是沒有的，至少是少有的，而依目前生活指數及中國官塲的實際情形說，高級公務人員的俸給，一樣感覺不足，這種不足，較中下級只有程度上的差別。爲了眞正提高行政效率，整肅政治風氣起見，對於他們的俸給，仍得有必要的增加。</p>

<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營本日下午三時三十分發表：（一）中國方面，帝國陸軍杭空部隊於此次江南作戰中，協力陸上部隊，截至六月六日所予敵機損害如次：擊落十七架，炸燬地上敵機二十二架，於該期間內，我方飛機之損害，計自炸四架，（二）緬甸方面，帝國陸軍航空部隊繼續實施對東部印度之進攻作戰，自五月一日迄六月五日止，所予敵機之損害如决。。擊落六十三架，炸燬地上敵機四十架，於此期間內，我方飛機損害，計自炸及未歸還者九架，負重傷者二十四架。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　最近日精銳航空部隊爲協力日軍在中國及印緬國境方面作戰，續作勇猛果敢之攻擊，擊毀敵方軍事施設飛機場及英美空軍之重要基地等，更曾攻襲昆明·重慶·建甌·印度吉大港等英·美空軍之根據基地，予以澈底打擊。日大本營茲發表新陸軍航空部隊在湘·鄂及緬甸阿拉坎協力日軍陸上部隊所作之偉大戰果，即在湘鄂地區作戰中，截止六月六日止，計共擊落敵機三十九架。在緬甸方面之作戰中，自五月一日迄六月五日止，計共擊落敵機百三十架。其中在中國戰綫陸日軍發動湘·鄂作戰時，日陸軍機在該作戰區附近展開熾烈空戰，截止六月五日止，已擊落渝方飛機×架，由岸上砲火擊落其三架，繼在六日復進襲四川梁山，湖北恩施，日機之奇襲梁山，完全成功，鄂地上渝機二十架，補給車十輛，貨車五輛，均全部中彈起火焚燬。又是役中日機襲恩施時，投彈悉中滑走路，予以澈底破壞，會與渝機七架交戰，擊落其一架。又在印緬國境方面，英印軍因前决阿拉坎作戰失敗，企圖在雨季前再度反攻，故屢决派機展開游擊戰，日空軍乃迎頭痛擊，有時積極進攻，每次均將敵機之蠢動企圖於事先擊破。目下渝方在軍事及財政方面，均已瀕於危局，而自渝第二十四集團軍軍長龐炳勛及第百十二師副師長榮子恒及其他抗戰將領等陸續參加和運後，渝方抗戰陣營之戰力，顯已極度低落。據最近消息，渝方鑒於今冬將遭史大危機，故亟盼英·美從速援助，企圖續作無益之抗戰，但此種甘爲東亞叛逆之行爲，日軍決斷然將其澈底擊滅。</p>

<h3 id="c5">華北日軍　發表一份戰況 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>北京八日中央社電　日華北派遣軍於八日下午五時，發表五月份主要戰况如次，華北日軍因日本對華協力政策愈密，戰力尤爲增强，至五月份後，已發揮野戰軍之眞精神，在華北全域，澈底猛擊渝軍，而將渝方所作二年戰勝論，及日軍由華北撤退等虛僞宣傳，一舉粉碎，尤以本年春間日軍之太行山作戰，在物質精神兩方面，均予渝共軍以極大打擊，渝方所宣傳之對日總攻擊，至是乃全歸泡影，現在之渝軍僅屬避免與日軍交綏，而在僻地保其餘喘。至五月份之主要作戰可分述如下，（一）河北省方面日軍爲覆滅太行山北部共軍根據地起見，於四月中旬開始猛攻，在冀西作戰中朔猛攻，遁入太行山滯留之渝軍，於五月布成包圍，擊破共軍戰力，分別圍殲，並粉碎其遊擊根據地之各種設施，及秘密組織等。又日軍向「津渤特別行政區」殘餘共軍，展開之掃蕩戰，自五月中旬以來即與國府方面軍警協力，進行巧妙之圍攻，逐漸推進中日協力之勦共工作，冀東及平北地區共軍，因屢遭日軍猛攻，已瀕潰滅，蓋在日軍壓力之前，已喪失戰意，而陷於四散潛伏之狀態。（二）山東省方面日軍對於盤據魯省中部沂水西北之于學忠所屬渝魯蘇戰區司令部及第五十一軍軍部第百零四師等，會與投順和運之吳化文將軍指揮之山東方面軍，密切協力，於五月中旬在空陸聯合之下，展開猛攻，渝軍遺屍被俘共約四千有餘，予以致命之重創。（三）山西省方面日軍爲擊滅盤據晋冀豫省境一帶之渝共兩軍起見，於四月下旬開始太行山作戰；旬日間即制渝第廿四集團軍主力於死命，第十四集團軍總司令龐炳勛及新編第五軍軍長孫殿英兩將軍，乃相率參加和運，於是華北之渝軍最後據點完全覆滅，日軍在本作戰後期，更轉鋒北向，痛擊渝共軍指揮中樞之第十八集團軍司令部摧及劉伯承部集團軍，推破其集團兵力，澈底覆減其各根據地之施設。</p>
<p>濟南八日中央社電　據日軍息：渝魯省「第六區保安隊司令齊子修」，前會率部下三萬人在魯省東臨道地區企圖蠢動，並强制徵發壯丁及糧秣等，日軍各部爲將其擊滅計，遂於五月三十一拂曉，開始行動，加以急襲，當包圍共所謂司令部所在地之蒿莊，及共他各據點，予以致命之打擊，迄三日晚止，判明之戰果，爲俘虜二九六七人，敵遺棄屍體二三八具，並奪得勝利品甚夥。</p>
<p>開封八日中央社電　豫省日軍精銳於上月中所獲綜合戰果如次：作戰次數一一一，渝軍兵力四五七五，渝軍棄屍六五三，俘虜三八三，鹵獲重機槍五，輕機槍九，步槍二五八，子彈九三九九，及其他軍用品無數。</p>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　據重慶電：渝軍政部長何應欽，於七日在渝第二次生產會議席上，報吿最近大陸戰况時，會言及龐炳勛孫殿英兩將軍率部七萬參加和平事，當時猶竭力掩飾事實，謂此僅爲日方揑造之宣傳，龐總司令孫軍長乃因一時個人之關係，而被日軍俘虜云云，觀此，足證渝方之狼狽，已如何深刻。何繼又說明此次日軍在湘鄂方面之夏季攻勢，謂日軍之攻勢，當初極爲猛烈，故渝軍受相當打擊，但後因指揮得宜，及美機出動作戰，故得重創日軍，而恢復原來態勢云云，此後不外以日軍之恢復原來態勢，指爲渝軍之勝利，用以掩飾渝軍之挫敗。渝方此種虛僞宣傳，旋即不攻自破，盖據七日重慶電，谓渝方軍事當局因此次長江流域之役，渝軍戰力素質，顯見低下，故決定對整編軍隊上，改變方針，即由着重數量而改重素質云。</p>

<p>「以前認爲飛機只要能飛就可以的時代，如在飛機上利用電波，耶該認爲是一種奢侈，或者是麻煩事。然而在今天飛機上則非有無綫電裝置不可。尤其是在現代戰爭中，飛機和電波眞可說是兩大明花。放射電波可以探知敵人，同時因爲何放射電波，你也就會被敵人探知。或者目前在使用着不使敵人感知的無綫電通信方法，或者爲了妨害和擾亂敵入的電波而放射電波，或者使用辨職敵國飛機的電波，——飛機輿電波是如此縱横錯綜地進行有立體活動」。</p>
<p>一製造出新的兵器，則馬上作出對抗牠的新防禦武器。爲了制勝和凌駕牠，而又造出新的武器。其新武器中的新武器，則是無綫電方向探知器——電波標程器。舉一個外國實例來看。三年前德國空軍非常殘酷地轟炸倫敦，改爲夜間空襲，可是未幾便完全停止。以後經過二年，又用絕對龐大機羣開始轟炸了。這究竟爲了什麽？正如前英國飛機生產部大臣皮佛布魯克所聲明的一樣，是因爲「在英國發明無綫電探知器（Radio　Locater），這是在第一棧上可以豫知德國空軍來轟炸的對抗方法，」目前田娘子軍來管理着。英國立刻徴求美國無綫電技師義勇隊。在其前後美國也發明這種器具而曾配備在菲律賓前綫上，後被我方軍隊所鹵獲者不少。星合博士解釋說：「按發射電波後到敵機或敵船再反射囘來的電波之時間，可以判斷其距離，如果這再和方向探知方法同時使用，可以正確地求出其位置。用這種器具，在二百公里的距離內很容易探知敵機的來襲，同時還能夠向雲中或成層圈上的筆機描凖射擊」。</p>
<p>即在暗夜和降雨期間，也同樣可以準確地射擊着不見的敵機，這就是新兵器的威力。這種電波果用的超短波。這是當硏究電離層時偶然發見的。對向一百至三百公里的電離層拍發電波後，而會反射囘來。當計算其時間以測量電離層的高度時，電波會碰到天空巾正飛的飛機而反射囘來。另外一個實例，正當廣播無綫電傳影（Televison）時，在其收發裝置上飛機一飛，則無綫電傳影電波反射囘來，在其收影機的畫面上，現出兩層影像。用於無綫電傳影的超短波對向飛機，以測量其反射囘來的時間。於是便產生電波標程器．電波的速度每秒鐘三十萬公里，所以在十五公里地點的敵機，其電波將在一萬分之一秒反射囘來．能夠精巧準確測量這種短暫時間者，即是電波標程器。「反過來說也同樣是眞理，」於是又可藉飛機發出的電波被大地反射囘來，測量其「極短」時間而可知飛機本身之高度。以前用氣壓高度表不能表現出從直接地面之距離。即「對地高度」。用音波測量也很困難。於是反用「電波標程器」，即是「電波高度表」。這種表實際上聽說各國還沒有使用，至於我國，則星合敎授說：</p>
<p>「東京帝國大舉故鯨井博士，很久以前就曾注意到電波標程器。他從外國囘來時，即民國二十二年大家仍然拚命硏究使用音波探知方向的方法時，而他已經留心到使用電波的方法，但非常可惜，未等着手而就去世了。」</p>
<p>在中國事變當初，學術振興會的研究並不劣於英美，而集中於這一問題上，現在究竟是否已經取得成功，我們只好看一下四月十四”陸軍省佐藤軍務局長以下的話。</p>
<p>「發明了藉超音波預知敵國潛水艇與飛機迫近的警戒器，於是潛水艇的活動範圍大受限制，而飛機在未達到目的之數百公里前，則可以被預知。這樣就可以使奇龔無效。同時更進一步而能測量出飛機的方向距離，指示高射砲，不論雲霧興夜間，可能擊中看不見的飛機。敵國方面，英國首先使用，而美國得到這種製造特許權後便在去年已經配備於前綫了。我國最近已經完成比英美更爲進步者，逐漸向重要的兵站處配備。」</p>
<p>但在這背後，學術振興會之硏究所賜與的供獻一定不少。</p>

<p>— 木村增太郎</p>
<p>這次日本推進對華新政策，不但國府表示好感，就是一般財政界人士，也有十分好感。但觀財界之動向，即可證明確已表示好感。</p>
<p>過去日本的居留地和公共租界，今後如何處置，雖然未定，可是一貫的原則，總是加強財界人士的自治機構，華方財界人士，也有此同感。所以他們不但歡迎日本的對華新政策，同時對於日本的撤廢治外法權，交還租界，也認爲日本有萬分的誠意，一致交口讚許。過去雖然有近衛三原則揭示。可是，一般中國人對於日本總還懷着一顆疑惑的心，自從日本推進新民政策之後，才根本消除了懷疑戒懼，他們認爲日本對中國已經誠心誠意的採取新政策，這一點對於財界人士有極大的效果。</p>
<p>何以能夠有這樣大的好感給予中國人呢？就是因爲華中方面已把物資統制權全部移交華方自理，而日由民間人士自己來辦這件事。</p>
<p>經濟運用上的創意性</p>
<p>事變以還，中國財界人感到最痛苦的，就是物資移動受到極度限制，使中國財界人不能根據自己創意而發揮，而且他們多年經營的事業，一旦也受了限制，這種現狀，自從緩和物資移動限制，創設全國商統制總會之後，已經緩和了不少，而且今後可以循着這條計劃做去，這樣的賢明措置，那得他們不額手稱慶來歡迎呢？</p>
<p>不過這裏還有個問題，他們沒有統制物資的經騐，心裏也沒有什麼準備，可是今後不得不負起責任來幹，所以中國財界人士對於這一點，恐怕心裏有點着急，至於這一點，日本方面也得要以寬大的心理，等待若干時日，那末一定有成績可觀了。</p>
<p>本來中國的國民經濟生活與政治從前就是不相關連的，像現在各國所施行的由國家權利所辦的統制經濟，在中國看來是極不方便的，中國方面，所謂政府者，並不能像日本一樣支配着國民生活，所以這樣子的國家要用政治力量來統制國民經濟是絕對不可能的，可是，政治力雖沒有深入民間，然而民眾的經濟自治，倒很發達，這是因爲他們在經濟生活中，自己確立了社會的統制雖無政治的統制，可是社會的統制，要算是世界各國中最發達的了。</p>
<p>商統會的使命</p>
<p>所以今後的經濟統制由商統會爲中心，分別組織同業公會，以此項所謂同業公會的自治組織作基礎，「在中國方面除了以此種自治組織來統制以外，相信其再也找不出第二條統制經濟的方法，此項組織，刻正準備之中，不過須要相當時日，同時本來的同業公會，單是謀本身保障，可是今後要賦以公益性，所以處於中心地位的商統會，尙須予以種種指導。</p>
<p>職是之故，急切欲求中國方面的物資統制，這可以說是無理強求，在去年之前，憑你怎樣勸他們組織同業公會，可是能集起來進行的，都不是殷實商人，不過想謀一時之利的掮客而已。</p>
<p>理解日本的政策</p>
<p>這一次却不同了，熱心起來從事組織公會的，都是經營有年的殷實商界，即此一端，可見得他們對於日本的政策如何理解，對於自己的責任如何明白願和日本協力再建設華中經濟，所以，再過一些日子，一面日方也極力扶助相信其不難達到目的。（雲鵬：譯自每日新聞）</p>

<p>張金海慘案後援會，於昨再度發告本市眾書，爲張案主持公道，茲摘錄原意如下：「張案的本質，是人類正義公道維護的問題。國家的法律不能對這樣任意殺人的嚴重案件，予以澈底的制裁，則今後在法租界數百萬市民，還有什麼保障？前天是張金海慘案第二次公開審理。承審推事王藍勝，於赴院途中，遭到法捕房中央區區長之阻止通行，雖經王推事出示身份證，亦告無效，並有因攔住扯破夾衫情事，此種行爲，殊令人可笑復可恨。來雷是本案的兇犯，法當局亦認爲事實。　　諱言，由法領事擬提起公訴，並予監禁。可是前日法捕房將主犯提到特二法院審問的時候，簡直使我們說不出他是一個殺人的犯人，那種神氣活現，若無其事的態度，已可顯示對懲辦兇犯的無誠意。郭士元，是洗衣店主，兼電車公司翻譯，平時在界內無惡不作，凡久居上海者，盡人皆知。張案發生，其爲案中之主要兇犯，事實早已明顯，固無庸再置辯，然郭犯等將罪責卸在米雷身上，使本案無期遷延，期達到不了了之的目的。</p>

<h3 id="c56">財場的特性 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 名士</p>
<p>上海之賭，花樣繁多。譬如在租界之內，每春秋二季，必有馬塲的競賭：一每半月必有一次慈善獎券，每這必有三天跑狗；每晚必有同力球塲。不過其爲禍之烈，不如南市賭塲遠甚。</p>
<p>我自己曾到南市參觀過四五個賭塲。綜括參觀後所得印象，的有兩點最爲觸目：即賭塲之豪華性與普遍性。何以說『豪華』呢？我看見某飯店的賭檯近壁，懸有大字標語，說明賭客下注每次限二十萬元，又看見西服少年，盛裝小姐，把每個五千元的籌碼，像竹頭木屑似的拋在賭檯上。在物資缺乏的今日，我們在賭塲只見紙烟像流水似地擲到各個賭客面前，又見食堂和大烟間裏，侍者像穿梭般地把豐盛的食物和毒物分送給滿坑滿谷的人羣。在這種塲面裏，『千』字和『萬』字都成了很小的數目。</p>
<p>何以說，『普遍』呢？這裏有白髮老者，有綠　少女，還有被母親帶來吃奶的孩子。這裏有一擲二十萬元的財閥，也有一擲一月薪金的小職員，也有押簪珥作賭資的家庭主婦。也有穿綠色制服的郵差，黑色制服的警察，又竟有把一疊角票押在賭檯上的苦工。</p>
<p>思之又思之，我覺得我們可以容忍這『　華』，却絕對不能容忍這「普遍』。因此，我希望當局能夠眞的禁賭最好：如其不能，至少應該暫時保留其『豪華』，而嚴禁其『普遍』。</p>
<p>好在各賭塲內都有一種特別間，規定衣冠不整潔的不准入內，又規定一百元或五十元以下的賭注，一槪拒絕；所以在這裏面的，差不多都是有資產的有閒階級。這有點近似文明各國俱樂部的塲面，我們即然保存這種特別問，也無損於文明國的體面。再則這些賭徒們即然在賭塲禁止之後，也必到馬塲，跑狗塲，同力球場去浪擲金錢。我們又何必厚於租界的變相賭塲，而薄於南市的正式賭塲呢？</p>
<p>至於特別間以外的賭塲，有立時禁止的必要。因爲這裏吸收了社會的整個的斷面的各層階級，他們是支持社會的柱石，毀滅了他們無異整個社會的集團自殺。我們看見報紙上尋人的廣吿，殺人的新聞，父子的反目，夫妻的離散，職員的潛逃，工人的失業，總之，一個不安定的社會的加倍不安，差不多都歸功於這種賭塲的存在。設若沒有賭塲，他們都是艱苦努力，殷勤上進的份子。狗馬，同力球等等貴族化專門化的賭博並無吸引他們的力量，惟有賭塲的平民化和簡易化才造成他們的墮落。</p>
<p>賭塲的後台老板所希冀的無非是金錢。他們旣有一擲二十萬的賭客，又何苦要陷害多數的站在肌餓綫上的人羣，吸收他們生命的血液，使他們不得不挺而走險或束手待斃呢？</p>
<p>我曾聽見最高當局說要爲東亞保存『人的資源』，賭塲分明是銷磨『人的資源』的魔窟，多少人的生命銷燬在這裏。多少生產的戰士的光陰消磨在這裏。</p>
<p>我們於督促政府之外，還望社會的領袖們自動地抵制賭塲，設若各公司的經理規定其職員有上賭塲者，革戰勿赦，如此不惟公司救了一些可以不墮落的職員，而推款潛逃的事也必大爲减少，設若學校有上賭塲使彌迫退學的規章，則魔窟裏也可减少可愛的靑年的踪跡。</p>
<h3 id="c57">創造興趣 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 百廖</p>
<p>「興趣能夠增加工作的效率，」這是大家都明瞭的。</p>
<p>理由很簡單：</p>
<p>第一，由於喜好而能澈底自動；第二，由於喜好而能專心一意。但是一個人不能對任何事物都產生興趣，這是遺憾的事；因此，許多人往往托詞於沒有興趣而减去了多量訓練的機會。</p>
<p>朋友們，捫心自問，有沒有這樣想過？有沒有這樣托詞過？</p>
<p>你們會說：「興趣的產生白然的，怎麽可以勉强呢？」</p>
<p>是的，興趣是不能勉强的，它完全在於一個人內心的希求，它完全是一個人心胸裏的熱量；但是，朋友們，請別忘了：</p>
<p>—興趣是可以創造的。</p>
<p>在你做一件你認爲是應該的事時，偏偏發覺了自己沒有興趣，這時你很容易會惱恨，而不得不令你相信興趣是一個難征服的敵人。然而僅祇爲了沒有興趣就丢去了幹應當幹的事的機會，終是可惜的；加之，沒有興趣就沒有辦法，更是可恥的、爲要避免辱恥，爲要攫取機會，我們該想出一種方法，使我們從無興趣的　淵中得救，達到增高工作效率和樂於幹事的目的，這便是創造興趣。</p>
<p>創造之初。是痛苦的爲了做不喜歡做的事，終是痛苦的：然而，朋友們，眼光放得遠大點，常興趣一旦被你創造成功了，那時勝利的快樂，比起現在這點輕微的痛苦，又算得什麽呢？</p>
<p>偉人的成就，那一個不是吃苦的，而那一個是怕苦的呢？他們戰勝了苦，終於他們創造了興趣，因此他們的事業才有成就的一天。</p>
<p>要曉得，事業的成功是多方面的，因此就要有多方面的興趣，假使爲了一點須要的事缺少了興趣，結果累及到全個事業，不是可惜嗎？</p>
<p>朋友們，這是無疑的，興趣的創造是成功的必要條件。</p>
<p>再有，如果你眞能創造出而產生了濃厚的興趣，這滋味是優而美的，甚過你本來興趣所給予你的滋味。你願意嘗一嘗嗎？</p>
<p>努力創造你自己的興趣！</p>
<h3 id="c58">學而思·思而學 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>要維持肉體的生存。便需吃飯，但一個人僅有肉體而沒有精神，也祇是一具行屍走肉而已；如欲維持精神的生存。便需讀書。</p>
<p>但是讀書首重於思考，不曾思考或不去思考的人，即使讀遍千卷萬册，其價値至冬相等於一架活動的書櫃罷了。</p>
<p>讀書祇是將別人的思想和意見斷片地，零星地收集起來，而且這些思想和意見並不是對於我們一律有益的，相反地，有很多內部包含着濃烈的毒素，我們必須利用思考的力量去比較它，批評它，整理它，濾除毒素，去蕪存菁。這樣然後才能變成有用的自己的知識。博學者和書獃子的區別便在這裏：前者讀書後下過一番思考的工夫。而後者則否。</p>
<p>人類文化的所以有進步，便是人類用讀書的方法收集了別人的思想和意見，能加以細細地咀嚼，慢慢地思考，再合以深邃的觀察，和水身的經騐，這樣胚育了相當的時期，才能發見某種眞理，或創行新的學說，使人類的文化又邁進了一步。所以欲求取知識，或闡發學術，讀書和思考二者缺一不可。打譬喻說：讀書是收集原料，思考是加以人工，原料經過人工的琢磨，才能成爲優良的出品。所以假使有原料而缺乏人工，則相等於有人工而缺乏原料，結果都是一無所成。</p>
<p>所以我們必需讀書，同樣也必需思考。</p>
<h3 id="c59">儲財與儲學 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 梅放</p>
<p>財　學爲人生不可缺之要素，二者之中，尤　學爲重，蓋儲學爲儲財之本，茍無學，財則何以儲財，是故儲財必先儲學也。</p>
<p>儲學　應以修身爲本，由學識中探求道德之眞諦，如勤儉之能養廉等，然後傳之於家、　之以國，則可達修身，齊家，治國，平天下之大道，且更須探求宇宙間之眞理，及努力於科學之知識，以達救世利羣之目的，則不負儲學之眞實意義矣。</p>
<p>儲財，應以勤勞，儉樸爲本，苟人皆以勤勞儉樸處事，則儲財當不難也，而此實爲儲財之捷徑。人之於中年，當以儲財爲要，然當暮齒之時，應以散財爲要，蓋我國舊習，多以此財，傳與子孫，子孫不保祖業，憎多敗去，是故，當暮齒之時，須施散此財，以造福社會也。</p>
<p>綜合論之，儲財與儲學，實同於健身與健心，蓋健身必先有健心，有健全之心，而求健全之身易，茍有健全之身，而無健全之心，實等於有財而無學，是故，人當先儲學，以已之學識而儲財，再以己之學識散財，則不負已之儲財與儲學矣。</p>

<p>— 文中</p>
<p>當一個人站在車站上等候電車的時候，總希望乘客擁擠得像沙丁魚般的車輛停下來，讓自己軋進去，即使半身在門內；半身在門外，用「騰雲」的法術吊過去，也似乎滿不在乎的！</p>
<p>旣進得車廂，却希望遇到中途的站頭不要停車開門，高喊：「軋死了！…沒有人下去…」</p>
<p>待到了自己的目的站，却又「改變作風」提高了嗓子呼喊：「噲！賣票的！有人下去，把門開開……唉！朋友！對不起！鬆鬆…」車子如果不停的話，於是乎口出怨言：「他媽的！阿啦出仔銅鈿仍要走寃枉路，勞苦了兩條腿。</p>
<p>從這平凡的事情上，短促的時間中人類自私的心理，暴露無遺。</p>
<p>有些人看見他人因投機而腰包膨脹了　很嚴止地諷刺他們發國難財，良心黑得像煤球，待自已一旦投機發了財，却漂亮地說：「小做做，算不得什麼的，」自己心裏明白：乘這個機會不撈一票，等甚麼好時屍？</p>

<p>發起社會公益事業、舉辦慈善機關，犧牲一已的精神，謀社會的福利，國家的利益；這是『公衆之利』是高尙的，是神聖的。</p>
<p>但在目前的社會上，滿目都是第一種人；而第二種人呢？簡直是沒有。同樣爲了一個『利』字，爲第一種『利』的人就像糞坑中的組。而爲第二種『利』的人就像鳳毛麟角。這樣下去，社會怎麼能安寗，國家怎麼能興盛</p>
<p>假使前面兩種人的數目能互相掉一下子的話，或者，即使第一種人的百分之一或千分之一能變爲第二種人也就好了。然而人的心理，水來只向『利己』一方面的。况且第一秤人已被『私人之利』迷失了人性，迷失了理智、有了自己，誰還顧到別人，顯到社會呢！</p>

<p>— 溫應時</p>
<p>潮汕位廣東東部韓江下游，原非磽瘠之區，果樹種植尤夥，蜜柑，甘蔗，龍眼，荔支均其著者。惟因地多山嶺，耕地較狹，且人口繁密，故每年出產糧食，的僅及消費量二分之一，不足之數，以往仰給於西貢，盤谷，仰光及蕪湖。事變以來，航運困難，然尙不時有糧船接濟，雖不能供足所缺，然中上之家，尙可安度。惟貧民因糧價高漲，餓斃者已常見不鮮矣。</p>
<p>潮汕稻米，每年二熟。首期春初播種，夏末可收。今春以來，糧船至者極稀，所望者惟夏末收成，孰料旱魃爲虐，數月無雨，田禾枯死，收獲無望。外來接濟，旣不可恃，本地生產，又成泡影，存糧將罄，糧價飛騰，每石價達儲券六千元左右。人民餓斃，日必逾百。易兒而食，雖尙少聞，賣女棄嬰，則已多見。現若不迅行救濟，則再過三月二月之後，存糧全盡，屬和平區之汕頭一市，潮安，潮陽，澄海三縣，近二百萬居民，勢將盡成餓莩，現除廣東同鄉會已泣電當局救濟外，望社會人士，急起賑濟，而潮州旅滬人士，不乏巨商，允望迅起救鄉。茲陳賑濟辦法數條：</p>

<h3 id="c67">「福利獎券」 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>國民政府爲吸收游資，增進人民福利起見，最近會經公布「福利獎券暫行條例」；我們還記得在本年二月十五日，國民政府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郞氏招待新聞記者暢談參戰後中國財政經濟諸問題時，即經透露，國民政府此後或有以發行彩票和獎勵有獎儲蓄爲收回通貨方策之一的考慮。</p>
<p>「福利獎券」係由財政部委託中央儲備銀行與中央儲蓄會發行，故爲國家彩票，共號召的力量，自然不同凡響；至其可以號召的理由，猶不在於未來的福利問題，而在於當前的巨額獎金；其可以號召的對象，猶不在於少數的有錢階級，而在於多數的中下層人民，因爲中下層人民致富的方法與途徑，到底是枯乏而狹小的。</p>
<p>因爲如此，我們遂不禁顧名思義，要把「福利獎券」的福利問題，加以說明一下。「福利獎券暫行條例」第九條載稱：「福利獎券，所收款項除應提獎金及一切問支所有剩餘之凈利，應撥交中央儲備銀行專款存儲，以備增進人民福利之用」。由於這樣一個明白的規定，購買「福利獎券」者羣宜放大眼光，不宜以「一等獎獨得獎金一百萬元」爲其惟一無二的目標，而却當以同胞民衆未來的共同幸福爲其今日投資的對象。如此，則明日之獎雖非我得，而最後之福利，終爲我有，因爲社會是集小我而成的，社會福利，就是我的福利。</p>
<p>那末，「人民福利」這幾個字，又怎樣去解釋呢？社會上老弱殘廢，窮無所歸，以至中年失業，靑年失學者，比比皆是，何可勝數？如何去救濟他們？如何去安置他們？如何去培植他們？那一件不是人民福利問題？又那一件不是國民經濟問題？</p>
<p>我們虔誠希望人民福利問題，得由於「福利獎券」的發行，而獲到一個眞實的解決，那末，「福利獎券」眞是功德无量了。我們並且希望有錢階級多買「福利獎券」，因爲我們並不以少數的中下層階級得到獎金爲可喜，而以多數的中下層階級得到福利爲可貴。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Discussion on the Living Problems of Civil Servants <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The increasingly serious living problems of civil servants, and their significant impact on national politics and social customs, need no further elaboration. The necessity of improving the lives of civil servants, and its importance, seems to have been recognized by all parties. The current problem is how to improve the lives of civil servants, demanding concrete measures and effective implementation. Regarding these issues, we offer further suggestions, earnestly hoping that the relevant authorities will study them and find the most appropriate solution to the current problems.</p>
<p>First, based on past facts, the relevant government authorities have paid considerable attention to the difficulties in the lives of ordinary civil servants, and have tried to improve them, such as repeatedly increasing the multiplier of living allowances and the Executive Yuan's decision on a system of material remuneration. However, there are several fundamental issues that must be studied and reformed first: (1) Is the civil servant salary system appropriate? The national legislation on civil servant salaries has always been a hierarchical system, partly inheriting the old practices of official salaries of past dynasties and partly referring to the systems of advanced countries. However, the former has time differences between the past and the present, and the latter has different national conditions in space. Especially due to the development of the current world war, if fundamental considerations are not made on the system, then all "improvement" measures will inevitably be far from reality and will not achieve the expected results. What we want the authorities to consider fundamentally is to address the objective wartime environment (mainly the gradual decline in currency purchasing power, the increase in material consumption and the gradual reduction in its supply, and the inevitable gradual rise in prices), and to formulate a wartime salary system that is most appropriate for the times, based on the different political and economic conditions of the country and various regions. The authorities' decision to implement a payment-in-kind system is a good method, but it must be determined appropriately in time and place to achieve practical results. (2) Is the problem of civil servant salary increases. Before the most appropriate and accurate system is established, to meet the urgent needs, a temporary measure of increasing salaries should be implemented first. Whether the previous increases have actually benefited the lives of civil servants is questionable, and this method needs to be adjusted. The real meaning of increasing salaries is not to maintain the relationship between the authorities and their subordinates, but to enable civil servants to concentrate on public service without worrying about their livelihood. If increasing salaries is only a negligible amount in practice, it will not only fail to solve the problem, but also cast a shadow on the psychology of every civil servant, and it will only reduce the civil servant's prestige for the government and enthusiasm for work. Therefore, we firmly believe that if we do not mention increasing salaries, then so be it; once we mention increasing, we must effectively solve the actual difficulties in the lives of civil servants. The above two points are the basic principles for improving the material lives of civil servants.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of improving the material lives of civil servants, the civil servants we are talking about are relatively broad, that is, all those whose work directly or indirectly promotes national policies and laws, and whose service departments have national, social, and public characteristics. From government agencies, the military, the police, culture and education, to the staff of important economic sectors, who live on fixed salaries, can be said to be civil servants. Due to the disparity in the ranks and status of various civil servants, due to the differences in service departments and their salaries, due to the different living conditions in different regions and periods, and even more due to the different family burdens of each civil servant, the improvement methods cannot be completely uniform. Therefore, what we want to suggest is that the authorities adopt differential methods, and the focus should be on genuine fairness and practical improvement. As for the standards of differentiation, they should be: (1) In order to improve administrative efficiency or work effectiveness, for civil servants in particularly important departments, for specialists and genuine talents that the country particularly lacks, and for those who actually have work to do and do it well, the most superior improvement conditions should be given, which also includes the meaning of encouraging specialized talents and work competition. However, those whose original material lives can be maintained are better given honorary treatment, and there is no need to increase their salaries. (2) In order to demand that improvements are practical, we repeatedly propose the method of basing on the minimum cost of living index in various regions. From the facts, the current minimum cost of living index in various regions, that is, the labor cost of living index, has increased from at least 100 to 3,372 or more compared to the pre-incident year of the 25th year of the Republic (according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's index in November last year). In fact, there is of course a greater increase today, but considering the salaries of any civil servant, almost none have increased from 100 yuan to more than ten times. The serious focus of the civil servant's life we are talking about lies here, and the reason why we advocate the method of improving the lives of civil servants based on the price index also lies here. Otherwise, the problem will never be solved! This rate of salary increase may increase the difficulties for the authorities, but, more practically speaking, even if salaries are increased based on the cost of living index, it is still not very thorough, and it is always behind the actual figure of the cost of living, because the cost of living index is already the actual performance of at least the past month, and the rate of salary increase is at least for a number of days or even a year in the future!</p>
<p>As for the authorities' difficulty in increasing expenditures, we should also have thorough consideration, but it should be noted that the differential standards we require also have the following conditions, namely (1) the old salary system and official system originally had many that were not in line with the times and wasted national funds. After the implementation of universal improvement of civil servant treatment, this old system will of course be eliminated. In any agency and department, it is not allowed to have the phenomenon of receiving dry salary without doing anything, and it is absolutely not allowed to have the phenomenon of holding concurrent positions and receiving concurrent salaries or holding concurrent positions without receiving concurrent salaries but receiving public funds. In this way, a large amount of floating expenses can be saved and used to increase the salaries of necessary civil servants. (2) Increasing salaries is mainly for civil servants who cannot maintain the minimum living standards for themselves and their families, especially for middle and lower-level civil servants, soldiers, police, and teachers; as for senior personnel, or those with fewer family burdens, their increase should also be relatively reduced. However, we can say truthfully that there are no people who bring money to become officials, at least there are few, and according to the current cost of living index and the actual situation in the Chinese officialdom, the salaries of senior civil servants also feel insufficient. This insufficiency only has a difference in degree compared to middle and lower levels. In order to truly improve administrative efficiency and rectify the political atmosphere, their salaries must still have necessary increases.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday The War Results of the Army Air Force Assisting Ground Troops in Combat in Jiangnan Shot Down More Than 100 Enemy Aircraft in Eastern India <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. today: (1) In China, the Imperial Army's Air Force cooperated with the ground troops in the Jiangnan campaign, and the damage inflicted on enemy aircraft as of June 6 was as follows: 17 shot down, 22 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground. During this period, the damage to our aircraft was a total of four self-explosions. (2) In Burma, the Imperial Army Air Force continued to carry out offensive operations against eastern India. From May 1 to June 5, the damage inflicted on enemy aircraft was as follows: 63 shot down, 40 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground. During this period, the damage to our aircraft was a total of nine self-explosions and non-returns, and 24 seriously injured.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the elite Japanese air force has continued to launch courageous and decisive attacks to cooperate with the Japanese army in the operations in China and the Indo-Burmese border, destroying enemy military facilities, airfields, and important bases of the British and American air forces. It has also attacked Kunming, Chongqing, Jian'ou, Chittagong, India, and other base bases of the British and American air forces, giving them thorough blows. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters now announced the great war results of the new army air force cooperating with the Japanese army ground troops in Hunan, Hubei, and Arakan, Burma. In the operations in the Hunan and Hubei areas, a total of 39 enemy aircraft were shot down as of June 6. In the operations in Burma, a total of 130 enemy aircraft were shot down from May 1 to June 5. Among them, when the Japanese army launched the Hunan and Hubei operations on the Chinese front, the Japanese army aircraft launched fierce air battles near the combat area. As of June 5, × Chongqing aircraft had been shot down, and three were shot down by shore-based artillery fire. Then, on the 6th, it attacked Liangshan, Sichuan, and Enshi, Hubei. The Japanese aircraft's surprise attack on Liangshan was completely successful. Twenty Chongqing aircraft, ten supply vehicles, and five freight vehicles on the ground in Hubei were all hit and burned. Also, when the Japanese aircraft attacked Enshi in this battle, the bombs hit the runway and thoroughly destroyed it. They fought with seven Chongqing aircraft and shot down one of them. Also, in the Indo-Burmese border area, the British and Indian troops attempted to launch a counter-offensive again before the rainy season due to the failure of the previous Arakan operation, so they repeatedly sent aircraft to launch guerrilla warfare. The Japanese air force met them head-on and dealt them heavy blows, sometimes actively attacking, and breaking the enemy aircraft's attempt to move in advance each time. At present, Chongqing is on the verge of crisis in terms of military and financial affairs, and since Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, Rong Ziheng, deputy commander of the 112th Division, and other anti-Japanese generals have successively participated in the peace movement, the combat power of the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing has been greatly reduced. According to recent news, Chongqing is aware that it will face a major crisis this winter, so it urgently hopes that Britain and the United States will provide assistance as soon as possible, in an attempt to continue the futile anti-Japanese war, but the Japanese army will resolutely and thoroughly destroy this act of being a traitor in East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Chairman Wang's Speech <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The original text of Chairman Wang's speech read by Chen Changzu is as follows: Today, the first class of aviation students of the Air Force Training Corps held a graduation ceremony. I, the Chairman, am deeply gratified, and I would like to say a few words to encourage all the graduates. All military personnel should be loyal and trustworthy, and contribute everything to the country in order to complete the great cause of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia. This should be consistently followed by military personnel of the army, navy, and air force. Speaking of the air force, the responsibility of our comrades is even greater. Recalling that in the tenth year of the Republic, the father of the nation repeatedly instructed the air force to save the country, and it has been more than twenty years since then, and the Chinese air force is still in its infancy. Every time I think about it, I feel frightened. Since returning to the capital, thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of friendly countries, we can see the lineup of today's new air force. Now, the first class of aviation students has completed their preliminary studies in a short period of two years, forming the strongest foundation of the air force. There is hope in sight, and I am deeply happy. The current task of the military is, first, to be able to recognize the mission of the times, and it must be known how to work hard in their respective positions. The above-mentioned great cause and mission have become more and more significant since the start of the Greater East Asia War and our country's official participation in the war. All our military personnel should firmly believe that we should combine the three mentalities of loving our country, loving friendly countries, and loving East Asia into one, so that we can complete the task of the present era. Be worthy of being a military man of the present era. In terms of the air force, the most important thing is to strengthen the awareness of building a new air force. We must know that it is extremely urgent to restore the material equipment of the air force, and the spiritual training is even more important. We must first have the spirit of diamond and a hundred refinements, and then we can create the great cause of diamond and a hundred refinements. There are three points that should be noted in this regard: (1) We should constantly train, and every military man must be able to implement every word of the training regulations for military men of the army, navy, and air force. (2) We should eliminate the past individualistic and factional wrong ideas of the air force, and take one doctrine as the center and wholeheartedly serve the country. (3) We should cultivate the spirit of bravery, diligence, hard work, and endurance, and be able to undertake the most difficult and greatest work, and be competent and happy. The above three points are the essential elements for creating a cadre of the new air force. The graduation of the students today is only the completion of one stage of the school year. Time is limited and knowledge is endless. Especially at the time when the Greater East Asia War is progressing, the knowledge and skills that all military personnel should use are hundreds of times more than in the past, so we should be new every day and keep pace with the times. I deeply hope that the students will be awed by the severity of the situation, feel the greatness of the burden, and strive for progress with their sincerity. Every morning and evening, we will not forget it in every meal, so that we can lay the foundation for the construction of the new air force and fulfill the responsibilities that should be fulfilled in the Greater East Asia War. I have deep hopes.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Japanese Army in North China Announced a War Situation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese North China Dispatch Army announced at 5 p.m. on the 8th the main war situation in May as follows. The Japanese army in North China has become more and more closely connected with Japan's policy of cooperating with China, and its combat power has been further enhanced. After May, it has exerted the true spirit of the field army, thoroughly and fiercely attacking the Chongqing army in the entire North China, and smashing the false propaganda made by Chongqing that it would win in two years and that the Japanese army would withdraw from North China. In particular, the Japanese army's Taihang Mountain operation this spring gave the Chongqing communist army a great blow in both material and spiritual terms. The total offensive against Japan that Chongqing had advertised to this point was completely in vain, and now the Chongqing army is only avoiding clashes with the Japanese army and preserving its remaining strength in remote areas. The main operations in May can be described as follows. (1) In Hebei Province, the Japanese army began a fierce offensive in mid-April in order to destroy the communist army base in the northern Taihang Mountains. In the Jixi operation, it fiercely attacked the Chongqing army that had fled into the Taihang Mountains. In May, it formed an encirclement, defeated the combat power of the communist army, and separately encircled and annihilated them, and crushed various facilities and secret organizations of its guerrilla base. In addition, the Japanese army launched a sweeping battle against the remaining communist army in the "Tianjin-Bohai Special Administrative Region." Since mid-May, it has cooperated with the government's army and police to carry out skillful encirclement and suppression, and gradually promote the work of cooperation between China and Japan to suppress the communists. The communist army in eastern Hebei and northern Pingbei has been on the verge of collapse due to repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. It has lost its will to fight before the pressure of the Japanese army and has fallen into a state of scattering and lurking. (2) In Shandong Province, the Japanese army closely cooperated with the Shandong Army commanded by General Wu Huawen, who had surrendered and was in the peace movement, against the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone Headquarters and the 51st Army Headquarters, the 104th Division, etc., which were based in the northwest of Yishui in central Shandong Province. In mid-May, they launched a fierce offensive under the joint air and land forces. The Chongqing army left about 4,000 corpses and prisoners, and was given a fatal blow. (3) In Shanxi Province, the Japanese army began the Taihang Mountain operation in late April in order to destroy the Chongqing-Communist armies that were based in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces. In ten days, it brought the main force of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing to its death. Generals Pang Bingxun, Commander of the 14th Army Group, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the Newly Organized 5th Army, then took the lead in participating in the peace movement. As a result, the last stronghold of the Chongqing army in North China was completely destroyed. In the later stage of this operation, the Japanese army turned north and fiercely attacked the headquarters of the 18th Army Group, the command center of the Chongqing-Communist army, and the army group of Liu Bocheng's troops, pushing and breaking through their group strength and thoroughly reducing the facilities of their bases.</p>
<p>Jinan, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Japanese army information: "Qi Zixiu, commander of the 6th District Security Team" of Chongqing-Lu Province, previously led 30,000 of his subordinates in an attempt to move in the Donglin Road area of Shandong Province, and forcibly conscripted able-bodied men and grain, etc. Each unit of the Japanese army began to take action at dawn on May 31 in order to destroy them, and launched a surprise attack. When they surrounded the so-called headquarters of the Communist Party in Gaozhuang, and other strongholds, they dealt a fatal blow to them. By the evening of the 3rd, the confirmed war results were 2,967 prisoners, 238 enemy corpses abandoned, and a large number of spoils of victory were seized.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 8th (Central News Agency) - The comprehensive war results obtained by the elite troops of the Japanese army in Henan Province last month are as follows: 111 operations, 4,575 Chongqing army troops, 653 Chongqing army corpses abandoned, 383 prisoners, 5 heavy machine guns seized, 9 light machine guns, 258 rifles, 9,399 bullets, and countless other military supplies.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch: He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs of the Chongqing government, reported on the recent war situation on the mainland at the Second Production Conference in Chongqing on the 7th. At the time, he tried his best to cover up the facts, saying that this was only a fabrication of propaganda by the Japanese side, and that Commander Pang and Army Commander Sun were captured by the Japanese army due to a temporary personal relationship. From this, it can be seen how deeply embarrassed Chongqing is. He went on to explain the summer offensive launched by the Japanese army in the Hunan and Hubei areas, saying that the offensive of the Japanese army was extremely fierce at the beginning, so the Chongqing army suffered considerable blows, but later, due to proper command and the deployment of American aircraft, the Japanese army was severely damaged and the original situation was restored. After that, the victory of the Chongqing army was used to cover up the defeat of the Chongqing army by referring to the restoration of the original situation of the Japanese army. This kind of false propaganda by the Chongqing side was immediately self-defeating. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 7th, the military authorities in Chongqing said that the combat effectiveness and quality of the Chongqing army in this battle in the Yangtze River basin were obviously low, so it was decided to change the policy on reorganizing the troops, that is, to change from emphasizing quantity to emphasizing quality.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discussed the Current Status of Various Tax Revenues <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held a regular meeting with newspaper reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (8th). Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance personally met with Chinese and Japanese reporters and answered questions from the reporters on the spot. Various issues related to the tax revenue situation in our country were released. The summary is recorded below: "The main income of the Ministry of Finance now is (1) salt tax, (2) customs duty, (3) unified tax, (4) special tax, of which the unified tax revenue is the most. We are currently trying to promote the increase in customs tax revenue, because most of the current customs tax regulations are ad valorem taxes. It seems unreasonable to still do so when prices are high, so we are now planning to change to ad valorem tax collection. Regarding the salt tax, the previous monthly income was 7 million yuan, but after the efforts of the authorities to rectify the salt-producing areas such as Su, Huai, and eastern Zhejiang, the total tax revenue for the next month is expected to increase to more than 10 million yuan. As for the income tax, it was only more than 1.5 million yuan per month when it was first levied, and now it has reached more than 5 million yuan per month, which has made significant progress. The results of other transit tax revenues are very good. Since the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Industry, and the General Association for Commercial Control have actively worked to deal with the price policy, prices have become more stable. However, the recent rise in prices in the market is due to the Dragon Boat Festival. It is expected that it will be restored within a day. Regarding the current status of industry, the Ministry of Finance has discussed with various banks in Shanghai to handle loans, so that the banks can provide appropriate loans to various legitimate businesses under the assistance and guidance of the Ministry of Finance. However, in terms of the current situation, there seems to be no problem with the capital for revitalizing various light industries and handicrafts. Also, the lack and inconvenience of materials and transportation capacity are currently being worked hard to improve, and the Bank of Communications has now launched loans in the interior, which will greatly benefit the encouragement of handicrafts and light industries in the interior.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Ramirez declared: Argentina will not tolerate foreign interference and will maintain its neutral policy towards foreign countries. The new government's message is as follows: "The Argentine Republic will fulfill its traditional friendship and faithful cooperation with other American countries in accordance with all existing agreements. As for the rest of the world, it will temporarily maintain a neutral policy. The interim government believes that in the current situation, it is particularly important to uphold the principle of its absolute autonomy and to allow the provinces to organize autonomous governments in any way. Since the Argentine people have decided to maintain their republican system in accordance with their constitution, foreign interference cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Rawson, after assuming the presidency on the 4th through a military revolution, stepped down only 28 hours later on the dawn of the 7th and was succeeded by General Ramirez. It is rumored that Rawson stepped down due to conflicts with various parties regarding foreign policy opinions. According to well-informed sources, the leadership of the revolutionary regime discussed foreign policy all night on the 6th. General Rawson advocated practicing Americanism and supporting the anti-Axis side, but other cabinet members unanimously opposed it. Therefore, it was decided that General Ramirez would succeed as president, as he advocates a neutral and Argentine autonomous policy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: According to a telegram from Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Argentine interim government issued the following announcement on the morning of the 7th: 1. General Rawson resigned as president, and General Ramirez succeeded as president. 2. The swearing-in ceremony of the new government, scheduled for the 7th, has been postponed. The domestic situation in Argentina has taken a sharp turn due to this revolution, so rumors about the new government are rampant. Although the surface is extremely calm, the inside seems very shaken. It is rumored that a unit of General Rawson's troops is advancing towards the capital from La Plata, 35 miles from Buenos Aires, due to conflicts in opinions between Ramirez and Rawson. Although the Argentine government has denied these rumors, public sentiment has not yet stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Full List of the New Government <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>

According to Reuters, the cabinet reshuffle of the Argentine new government was due to differences in opinion on foreign policy between General Rawson and some cabinet members, as some cabinet members did not agree with his pro-anti-Axis and Pan-American attitude. According to well-informed sources in Uruguay's capital, Ramirez is in favor of a neutral policy. Furthermore, the Argentine radio station announced last night that President Ramirez has no intention of resigning and that the troops have expressed their support in maintaining order.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: General Ramirez declared to cabinet members and representatives of the navy and army today: "May God help me perform my duties, and I hope for national cooperation in order to implement my peaceful construction work."

General Rawson's sudden resignation was for the sake of facilitating the formation of a satisfactory cabinet. The President then gave a speech to the public in the May Market outside the government building. The crowd applauded and was extremely enthusiastic.</p>

At present, fierce battles are taking place between the German and Soviet forces along the Donets River front. It is noteworthy that the offensives are often launched by the German army. At the same time, the German air force in the northern front echoed the units that bombed Gorky, fiercely bombing Leningrad, causing great damage to its tank and aircraft factories. They also bombed the Moscow-Arkhangelsk railway, the key transportation hubs of Lovacki, east of Kharkov, and northwest of Sc, causing great damage to the Soviet army's corps, fuel depots, ammunition depots, and transport trains.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: The Haithong News Agency reports that the British press continued to wage psychological warfare against the Axis powers yesterday, exaggerating Roosevelt and Churchill's decision at the Washington conference to launch a large-scale attack on Europe. One news item stated: "The unprecedentedly largest anti-Axis combat organization, assisted by aircraft, warships, transport ships, and assault boats, can launch an attack on Europe with three million troops in a matter of days or even hours." From the broadcasts of American radio stations, it can also be seen that the United States is equally nervous. Many American radio commentators have hinted at an imminent attack on Europe, with one even saying: "The time has come." According to the London Times, "Churchill's main purpose in visiting North Africa was to conduct a final inspection of preparations for launching an attack on the Axis fortress. The attack on Europe can only be seen as the greatest undertaking in military history." The News Chronicle reported: "The most important result of Churchill's discussions will soon be the implementation of a vast land, sea, and air war." However, there are also warnings, saying that the defense of Europe will be undertaken with great suffering by an unyielding enemy, so easy victory cannot be expected. Even The Times stated: "Since the Battle of Dunkirk, Britain has faced the most dangerous stage of the war, but the coming war may be the longest, most difficult, and require the greatest sacrifices."</p>

<h3 id="e24">Current Status of Malayan Industries <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Shonan, Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th: It has been a year and a half since the implementation of military administration in Malaya. During this time, thanks to the efforts of the military administration authorities, there has been rapid development in all aspects. Malayan rubber production accounts for seven-tenths of the world's total rubber production, so it is not an exaggeration to say that Malaya is completely located in a rubber forest. Because trade with various countries in the world has been cut off, digesting this large amount of rubber has become an important issue for Malaya. For this purpose, the Japanese military administration established a rubber liquefaction plant in Lanka. The liquefaction work of the plant is still small in scale, mainly because everything is still difficult at the beginning of its establishment. It can be asserted that it will develop into a large-scale industry in the future. Therefore, the digestion of this rubber is a major turning point in the field of oil production. Regarding the issue of increasing food production, Malaya's food production is not very abundant due to the scarcity of paddy fields, insufficient farmers, and the immaturity of cultivation methods. Therefore, the main source of food, rice, has relied on imports from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. After the Japanese implemented military administration, they made the greatest efforts to establish a self-sufficient food base, encouraging residents to reclaim forests and idle land that has been turned into open space due to the war. At the same time, they also established farmer training schools and farmer training centers to train farmers and actively increase production. Thanks to the efforts of the indigenous people, the increased production of alternative foods such as sweet potatoes has now yielded significant results. Other handicrafts, paper, textiles, soap, and other daily necessities have also been revitalized since the Japanese military administration, aiming at self-sufficiency in daily necessities. Since the implementation, the results have been quite good.</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Sound of Scientific Victory (3): Capturing Enemy Aircraft in the Stratosphere: The All-Consuming "Fighting Radio Waves" <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The aviation radio and anti-aircraft radio researched by the Academic Promotion Association is a kind of "secret matter." To what extent has the research progressed? What kind of items are being researched? Even whether a certain item has already been successful? We cannot elaborate on these questions, lest the enemy know. Therefore, Dr. Masaji Hoshiai (Professor of Engineering at Tokyo University) can "only talk about a little bit of the theory of radio waves applied to aviation." Let's take a look at the main points of Dr. Hoshiai's lecture.</p>
<p>"In the past, it was thought that as long as an airplane could fly, using radio waves on the plane was a luxury or a nuisance. However, today, airplanes must have radio equipment. Especially in modern warfare, airplanes and radio waves can truly be called the two bright flowers. Radiating radio waves can detect the enemy, and at the same time, because you are radiating radio waves, you will also be detected by the enemy. Or, we are currently using radio communication methods that do not make the enemy aware, or radiating radio waves to interfere with and disrupt the enemy's radio waves, or using radio waves to identify enemy aircraft—airplanes and radio waves are so intricately intertwined and carrying out立体 activities."</p>
<p>As soon as a new weapon is created, a new defensive weapon is immediately created to counter it. In order to overcome and surpass it, new weapons are created again. The newest of the new weapons is the radio direction finder—the radio wave locator. Let's look at a foreign example. Three years ago, the German air force brutally bombed London, switching to night air raids, but soon stopped completely. Two years later, they began bombing again with absolutely massive formations. Why is this? As former British Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, declared, it was because "Britain invented the radio locator, which is a countermeasure that can predict the German air force's bombing on the first ship." Currently, the Women's Auxiliary Air Force manages it. Britain immediately recruited a volunteer corps of American radio technicians. Before and after that, the United States also invented this equipment and equipped it on the front lines in the Philippines. Many of these were seized by our army. Dr. Hoshiai explained: "By the time it takes for the radio waves to be emitted and reflected back from the enemy aircraft or ship, the distance can be determined. If this is used in conjunction with direction finding methods, the position can be accurately determined. With this equipment, it is easy to detect enemy aircraft approaching within a distance of 200 kilometers, and it can also aim and fire at enemy aircraft in the clouds or stratosphere."</p>
<p>Even in the dark night and during rainfall, you can accurately shoot invisible enemy aircraft; this is the power of the new weapon. This radio wave uses ultra-short waves. This was accidentally discovered when studying the ionosphere. After sending radio waves towards the ionosphere, which is 100 to 300 kilometers away, they are reflected back. When calculating the time to measure the height of the ionosphere, the radio waves hit an airplane flying in the sky and are reflected back. In another example, when broadcasting television, if an airplane flies over the transmitting and receiving equipment, the television radio waves are reflected back, and two layers of images appear on the screen of the receiver. Ultra-short waves used for television are aimed at the aircraft to measure the time it takes for them to be reflected back. Thus, the radio wave locator is produced. The speed of radio waves is 300,000 kilometers per second, so for an enemy aircraft at a location 15 kilometers away, the radio waves will be reflected back in one ten-thousandth of a second. The device that can accurately measure this short period of time is the radio wave locator. "The reverse is also true," so the radio waves emitted by the aircraft can be reflected back by the earth, and the "extremely short" time can be measured to determine the height of the aircraft itself. In the past, barometric altimeters could not show the distance from the direct ground. That is, the "ground height." Measuring with sound waves is also difficult. Therefore, the "radio wave locator" is used in reverse, which is the "radio wave altimeter." It is said that no country is actually using this type of altimeter yet. As for our country, Professor Hoshiai said:</p>
<p>"Dr. Kujirai of Tokyo Imperial University noticed the radio wave locator a long time ago. When he returned from abroad, in 1933, when everyone was still desperately researching methods of using sound waves to detect direction, he was already paying attention to the method of using radio waves, but unfortunately, he passed away before he could begin."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the China Incident, the research of the Academic Promotion Association was not inferior to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and it was concentrated on this issue. Whether it has now been successful, we can only look at the words of Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato on April 14.</p>
<p>"We have invented a warning device that uses ultrasonic waves to predict the approach of enemy submarines and aircraft, thus greatly limiting the scope of submarine activities, and aircraft can be predicted hundreds of kilometers before they reach their destination. This makes surprise attacks ineffective. At the same time, it is possible to further measure the direction and distance of the aircraft and direct anti-aircraft guns to hit invisible aircraft regardless of clouds or nighttime. On the enemy side, the United Kingdom used it first, and the United States obtained the manufacturing license and has already deployed it on the front lines last year. Our country has recently completed something more advanced than those of the United Kingdom and the United States, and is gradually deploying it to important supply stations."</p>
<p>But behind this, the contribution given by the research of the Academic Promotion Association must be significant.</p>

The Chinese Side Will Organize Consumer Cooperatives. <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the rationing of cotton products will begin with Japanese residents. After implementing rationing for white rice, charcoal, sugar, bread, butter, milk, and laundry soap, the threat to the livelihood of Japanese residents in Shanghai in terms of these goods has been eliminated. Starting in July of this year, cotton products will also be rationed, because the prices of cotton products have recently skyrocketed, and even things like absorbent cotton and khaki cloth have almost disappeared from the market. In order to alleviate these difficulties, the Chinese side will form consumer cooperatives, and the Chinese authorities have also announced that they will implement cotton product rationing for Japanese residents. The Japanese residents have high expectations for this.</p>
<p>Eleven Types of Cotton Products to be Rationed</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General and the Residents' Group are considering rationing daily necessities at low prices in response to public opinion, and implementing a coupon rationing system to bring consumption savings into normalcy. Daily necessities such as cotton products will also be rationed at low prices, which will eliminate hoarding. The cotton products that will be rationed include towels, absorbent cotton, cloth socks, yarn socks, undershirts, shirts, and a total of eleven types. In addition to cotton products, coupon rationing systems for other items such as cosmetics, soap, and cooking oil are also being considered for implementation.</p>

According to the Datong News Agency, the postal authorities will issue nine-cent stamps in order to complement the previously issued sixteen-cent stamps, so that they can be combined to make twenty-five cents, which will facilitate delivery.</p>

<p>— Masutaro Kimura</p>
<p>This time, Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China has been met with goodwill not only from the National Government but also from people in financial circles in general. Observing the trends in the financial world proves that goodwill has indeed been expressed.</p>
<p>Although it has not been determined how Japan's settlements and public concessions will be handled in the future, the consistent principle is to strengthen the autonomous organizations of people in financial circles. People in Chinese financial circles also feel the same way. Therefore, they not only welcome Japan's new policy towards China, but also believe that Japan has great sincerity in abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, and they all praise it. Although the Three Principles of Konoe were revealed in the past, the average Chinese still harbored a heart of doubt towards Japan. Since Japan promoted the new people's policy, suspicion and fear have been fundamentally eliminated. They believe that Japan has sincerely adopted a new policy towards China, which has a huge effect on people in financial circles.</p>
<p>Why is it able to give such great goodwill to the Chinese? This is because the rights to control supplies in Central China have been completely transferred to the Chinese side for self-management, while the Japanese side handles this matter by private individuals themselves.</p>
<p>Creativity in Economic Operation</p>
<p>Since the incident, what Chinese financial people have felt most painfully is that the movement of materials has been extremely restricted, preventing Chinese financial people from developing based on their own creativity, and the businesses that they have been operating for many years have also been restricted. This situation has been alleviated a lot since the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials and the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association, and in the future, we can follow this plan. How can they not applaud and welcome such wise measures?</p>
<p>However, there is still a problem here. They have no experience in controlling materials, and they have no preparation in their hearts, but they have no choice but to take responsibility and do it in the future, so Chinese financial people are probably a little anxious about this. As for this point, the Japanese side must also wait for some time with a magnanimous mentality, and then there will definitely be considerable achievements.</p>
<p>Originally, China's national economic life and politics were not related in the past. The controlled economy implemented by state rights, as practiced in various countries today, is extremely inconvenient in China's view. In China, the so-called government cannot control the lives of the people like Japan. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for such a country to use political power to control the national economy. However, although political power has not penetrated the people, the economic autonomy of the people is very developed. This is because they have established social control in their economic life. Although there is no political control, social control can be regarded as the most developed in the world.</p>
<p>The Mission of the General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Therefore, the economic control in the future will be centered on the General Chamber of Commerce, and trade associations will be organized separately. Using this so-called autonomous organization of trade associations as a foundation, "in China, other than using this kind of autonomous organization to control, I believe that there is no second way to control the economy. This organization is currently being prepared, but it will take a considerable amount of time. At the same time, the original trade associations only sought to protect themselves, but in the future, they must be given a public service nature, so the General Chamber of Commerce, which is in the central position, must be given various kinds of guidance.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is unreasonable to demand the control of materials from the Chinese side. Before last year, no matter how you persuade them to organize trade associations, those who could gather together to proceed were not established merchants, but only brokers who wanted to seek temporary profit.</p>
<p>Understanding Japan's Policy</p>
<p>This time is different. Those who are enthusiastically engaged in organizing associations are established merchants who have been in business for many years. From this point alone, it can be seen how they understand Japan's policies and how clearly they understand their responsibilities. They are willing to cooperate with Japan to rebuild the economy of Central China. Therefore, after some time, the Japanese side will also do its best to assist, and I believe that it will not be difficult to achieve the goal. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

Students at all levels from Yangzheng, Qunying, and Shulan primary schools and Aurora University either saved candy expenses, saved pocket money, or held recreational activities to collect relief funds. All of this shows the importance that all sectors of society attach to North China disaster relief and the enthusiasm of their sympathy. We deeply hope that everyone will follow suit, so that we can gather the strength of the masses and work together to support this righteous cause.

<p>In order to raise funds for disaster relief in North China, the municipal government specially held a charity basketball and football match for disaster relief in North China. The Capital Military Team, led by Mr. Wang Mengjin, the son of the chairman, came to Shanghai from Beijing specifically to compete. The basketball game has been held for three consecutive days since the 5th and has already ended. Yesterday (the 8th), a small-scale charity football match was held. The Military Team won 4 to 2 in the first half. In the second half, the film stars temporarily pulled in strongmen, and invited football masters Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Zhang Lingen, and Jin Jiabiao to come down to earth to boost their strength. As a result, the score was tied 5 to 5. Although the weather was cloudy and the ground was muddy yesterday, the game was held as usual in the rain. An unusually large number of people went to watch the game. Many female stars came to the scene to cheer, so the atmosphere was lively, no less than the grandeur of a major game held on a normal day. Referee Shen Huichun and side judge Zhang Le, Lin Jiongan, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, sounded a silver whistle to open the ball.</p>
<p>First Game</p>
<p>The film stars were overwhelmed and showed a one-sided slump. Zhao Shouting of the Military Team scored the first goal, and then lost two more goals, scored by Zhao Guanghua, Zhan Daozhi, etc. Then, the film stars transferred personnel, and Wang Naidong, Wang Chunquan, and Li Pingqian were sent down to the field to save the situation, and Shu Shi knocked on the door to pull back a goal, forming a 3 to 1 situation. After Chen Yiqing's pass, he attacked the goal and created a 3 to 2 situation. The Military Team launched a counterattack, and Zhan Daozhi's deep breakthrough scored another goal, and the Military Team took the lead 4 to 2 in the first half.</p>
<p>Charity Ball</p>
<p>Lemon was auctioned off the charity ball, reported by side judge Zhang Le, and the price rose sharply in a straight line. As a result, Mr. Pan Sansheng bought the charity ball for 20,000 yuan on behalf. At this point, the film stars transferred personnel again, and invited four famous generals, Dai Lin, Jia Youliang, Zhang Lingen, and Jin Jiabiao, to come down to the field. Goalkeeper Yue Feng was transferred back, and Wang Chunquan took over. The Military Team remained the original team.</p>
<p>Draw</p>
<p>Re-battle, the Military Team was still unwilling to show weakness, and soon Zhan Daozhi made another contribution and scored another goal, making it 5 to 2. Then the film stars launched a counterattack one after another and built three goals in ten minutes, tying the game at 5 to 5. Negotiate. The Military Team's challenge in Shanghai this time has been successfully completed after four consecutive days of battle, and it is said that it is scheduled to return to Beijing by car within days.</p>
<p>Confucius Society Appeals for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese Confucius Society appealed to members to provide relief for the drought in North China. Its announcement stated, "The disaster situation in North China is serious. How can we, who are warmly clothed and well-fed, bear to see it? Members of this association should quickly contribute money if they have money, and contribute efforts if they have strength. We should use the strength of the group, and it is easy to raise the strength of the masses to rescue the dying and starving North China victims. Mencius said, 'The heart of compassion is possessed by all men.' Yu thought of the world as if he were drowning, and he was still hungry. As the saying goes, 'Plant one seed in spring and reap ten thousand seeds in autumn.' Contributing money and effort, even if the cause is small, has its own fruit of happiness. This is an opportunity for members of the Confucius Society to practice the 'benevolence' of the sages. From the perspective of conscience, disaster relief is like fire fighting, and righteousness does not allow sitting idly by. From the perspective of karma, rewards and punishments are never wrong. The Buddha said, 'Firm wealth' means that the money and wealth in the world are all things that come by chance, they come quickly and go quickly. It is better to do good deeds and give alms to plant blessings widely, which will benefit descendants. We hope that all members of the Confucius Society will open their benevolent pockets, the more the better, and the less the better. Be sure to contribute money if you have money, contribute effort if you have strength, or widely publicize it to save our victims. The merit is immeasurable." (Donations can be sent directly to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for collection and transfer to the Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association, or to No. 954 Aidoa Road for collection and transfer.)</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that recently, on the Pacific front, the decisive battle between Japanese and American forces has become increasingly fierce. In particular, the heroic death of Marshal Yamamoto at the head of his command and the complete annihilation of the Sakibe unit on Attu Island have further strengthened the resolve of 100 million Japanese people to consolidate their resolve to destroy Britain and America. The Japanese people have recently launched a fervent campaign to donate military aircraft and a campaign to increase air power a hundredfold. The 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai are also responding to their country's donation campaign, launching an even more enthusiastic campaign to donate funds for military aircraft. According to the Shanghai Japanese Naval Authority, from May 8th to the 8th of this month, the Shanghai Japanese Naval Attaché's Office has received a total of approximately 4,976,907 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes for naval aircraft donations from Japanese residents, and approximately 321,591 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes for national defense donations. The total amount is more than 5,298,498 yuan, a truly staggering figure. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great victories and has established an absolutely invincible strategic posture in the Pacific. Today, the Japanese people vow to follow in the footsteps of Marshal Yamamoto and strive to complete the war. If one aircraft is lost, two more will be built. If one warship is lost, two more will be built, so that they can strive to thoroughly destroy Britain and America.</p>

<h3 id="e43">French Concession Actively Trains People in Air Defense; Previous Exercises Have Been Unsatisfactory; 100 Yuan Fine for Light Leakage <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In order to familiarize the public with air defense measures, the French Concession authorities began air defense training on the first of this month. Each district and Lian Bao is holding sessions at various times. The reporting method is that the district police stations issue orders, notifying the relevant Lian Bao by telephone in advance to prepare, and then issuing orders by telephone at the time. When the alarm begins, each Lian Bao relays the order to each Bao, and the reporters ring bells to inform residents to take air defense measures. The method of canceling the alarm is the same. During the exercises, the heads of the police stations in each district personally inspect. In the past few days, each district and Lian Bao has held separate sessions one after another. The authorities believe that the results have been unsatisfactory, especially on the night before last, because of the Dragon Boat Festival, 19 out of 10 households were still celebrating, with light leaking out, which was clearly visible from a high place. The authorities expressed great regret and have ordered each Lian Bao to inform the Baojia chiefs to pay close attention and strive to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Many Fines in the Route Mailand Area</p>
<p>Also, the Lian Bao in the Route Mailand area has held exercises several times, but the results have also been very poor, and many residents have been fined. The method of punishment is that during the exercise that night, the police stations send personnel to inspect. If any light leakage is found, the house number will be recorded. The next morning, the police station will issue a summons. After receiving the summons, the resident must go to the police station to pay the fine and receive a penalty slip. The fine is 100 yuan per household, but the Baojia chief will also be held jointly liable and punished for dereliction of duty with a fine of 100 yuan as a warning.</p>
<p>Route Joffre District Opens Bao Chief Meeting</p>
<p>It is also learned that the exercises on Route Joffre have not been satisfactory. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a meeting of Bao chiefs was held at the Route Joffre Police Station. The head of the detectives instructed on the shortcomings and the air defense measures that should be taken, and cautioned the Bao chiefs to inform each household that if there are any "light leaks" or unsatisfactory measures in the future, once verified, a fine will be imposed.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association Issues Another Public Announcement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association yesterday issued another public announcement to the residents of this city to uphold justice for the Zhang case. The following is an excerpt of the original meaning: "The essence of the Zhang case is the issue of upholding human justice and fairness. If the national law cannot thoroughly punish such a serious case of arbitrary killing, what guarantee will the millions of citizens in the French Concession have in the future? The day before yesterday was the second public hearing of the Zhang Jinhai case. Judge Wang Lansheng was prevented from passing by the chief of the central district of the French police force on his way to the court. Although Judge Wang showed his identification, it was ineffective, and there was even an incident of the jacket being torn due to obstruction. This kind of behavior is both ridiculous and hateful. Leilei is the perpetrator of this case, which the French authorities also acknowledge as a fact. There is no need to avoid mentioning that the French consul intends to file a public prosecution and imprison him. However, when the French police brought the main perpetrator to the Special No. 2 Court for questioning the day before yesterday, he simply made us unable to say that he was a murderer. That kind of smug and nonchalant attitude already shows a lack of sincerity in punishing the perpetrator. Guo Shiyuan is a laundry owner and translator for the tram company who has been doing evil in the concession for a long time. Everyone who has lived in Shanghai for a long time knows this. After the Zhang case occurred, it was already obvious that he was the main perpetrator in the case, so there is no need to argue about it further. However, Guo and the others are shifting the blame to Miele, so that the case is indefinitely delayed, in order to achieve the purpose of not resolving it.</p>
<p>Today, we should seek a reasonable solution for this case under the principles of upholding justice and humanity and safeguarding national sovereignty."</p>

<h3 id="e56">Characteristics of the Gambling Scene <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— A Famous Scholar</p>
<p>Gambling in Shanghai takes many forms. For example, within the concessions, there are horse racing gambling events every spring and autumn; there is a charity lottery roughly every two weeks; and there are dog races lasting three days each time; and there is the T'ung-li [betting on] ball game every night. However, the harm these cause is far less severe than that of the gambling dens in the Nanshi [Chinese City].</p>
<p>I myself have visited four or five gambling dens in Nanshi. Summarizing the impressions I gained after these visits, two points were most striking: the luxuriousness and the pervasiveness of the gambling dens. Why do I say "luxurious"? I saw large-character slogans hanging near the gambling tables in a certain hotel, stating that each bet by a gambler was limited to 200,000 yuan. I also saw young men in Western suits and elegantly dressed young ladies throwing chips worth 5,000 yuan each onto the gambling tables as if they were bamboo scraps or wood shavings. In today's era of material scarcity, we saw cigarettes being tossed in front of the gamblers like flowing water in the gambling dens, and we saw waiters in the dining halls and opium dens distributing sumptuous food and addictive substances to the densely packed crowds like shuttles weaving through a loom. In such a scene, the words "thousand" and "ten thousand" became very small numbers.</p>
<p>Why do I say "pervasive"? Here, there are white-haired old men, young girls, and even children brought by their mothers to be breastfed. Here, there are tycoons who throw away 200,000 yuan in one go, as well as petty clerks who wager a month's salary, and housewives who pawn their hairpins as gambling funds. There are also mailmen in green uniforms and policemen in black uniforms, and even coolies who place a stack of fractional notes on the gambling tables.</p>
<p>Thinking about it again and again, I feel that we can tolerate the "luxuriousness," but we absolutely cannot tolerate the "pervasiveness." Therefore, I hope that the authorities can truly ban gambling altogether. If they cannot, they should at least temporarily preserve its "luxuriousness" and strictly prohibit its "pervasiveness."</p>
<p>Fortunately, each gambling den has a special room with regulations that those who are not neatly dressed are not allowed to enter, and bets below 100 or 50 yuan are generally rejected. Therefore, those inside are almost all members of the propertied and leisurely classes. This is somewhat similar to the scene in clubs in civilized countries. Since we preserve these special rooms, it does not detract from the dignity of civilized countries. Moreover, these gamblers, even after the gambling dens are banned, will inevitably go to the horse racing tracks, dog racing tracks, and T'ung-li ball game venues to squander their money. Why should we be more lenient towards the disguised gambling dens in the concessions and more harsh towards the official gambling dens in Nanshi?</p>
<p>As for the gambling dens outside the special rooms, there is an immediate need to ban them. This is because they absorb all classes of society, and these people are the pillars supporting society. Destroying them is tantamount to the collective suicide of the entire society. We see missing person advertisements in the newspapers, news of murders, fathers and sons turning against each other, husbands and wives separating, clerks absconding, and workers losing their jobs. In short, the increased instability of an already unstable society is almost entirely due to the existence of these gambling dens. If there were no gambling dens, they would all be hardworking and diligent individuals striving for progress. Dog racing, T'ung-li ball, and other aristocratic and specialized forms of gambling do not attract them. Only the popularization and simplification of gambling dens lead to their downfall.</p>
<p>What the backstage bosses of the gambling dens hope for is nothing more than money. Since they already have gamblers who bet 200,000 yuan in one go, why should they harm the majority of people standing on the brink of starvation, sucking the blood from their lives, forcing them to take risks or wait for death?</p>
<p>I have heard the highest authorities say that they want to preserve "human resources" for East Asia. Gambling dens are clearly dens of demons that consume "human resources," where the lives of countless people are destroyed, and the time of countless productive soldiers is wasted.</p>
<p>In addition to urging the government, we also hope that social leaders will automatically boycott gambling dens. If the managers of various companies stipulate that any employee who goes to a gambling den will be dismissed without pardon, this will not only save some employees from falling into depravity, but also greatly reduce cases of embezzlement and flight. If schools have regulations to expel students who go to gambling dens, then the traces of lovable young people in the dens of demons can also be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Creating Interest <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Liao</p>
<p>"Interest can increase work efficiency." This is something everyone understands.</p>
<p>The reason is simple:</p>
<p>First, because of liking, one can be thoroughly automatic; second, because of liking, one can be single-minded. However, it is a pity that a person cannot be interested in everything. Therefore, many people often use the excuse of not being interested to reduce the opportunity for a lot of training.</p>
<p>Friends, ask yourselves, have you ever thought this way? Have you ever used this excuse?</p>
<p>You might say, "The generation of interest is natural, how can it be forced?"</p>
<p>Yes, interest cannot be forced. It completely lies in a person's inner desires; it is completely the heat in a person's heart. But, friends, please don't forget:</p>
<p>—Interest can be created.</p>
<p>When you are doing something you think you should do, but suddenly find that you are not interested, you can easily become annoyed and have to believe that interest is a difficult enemy to conquer. However, it is a pity to give up the opportunity to do what you should do just because you are not interested. Moreover, not being interested means there is no way, which is even more shameful. To avoid shame, to seize opportunities, we should think of a way to save ourselves from the abyss of disinterest, to achieve the goal of increasing work efficiency and enjoying work, which is to create interest.</p>
<p>The beginning of creation is painful, because it is always painful to do things you don't like to do. However, friends, look at the bigger picture. Once you have successfully created interest, what is the joy of victory compared to the slight pain you are experiencing now?</p>
<p>Which achievement of great people was not achieved through suffering, and which one was afraid of suffering? They conquered suffering, and finally they created interest, so their careers had a day of success.</p>
<p>You have to know that the success of a career is multifaceted, so you have to have multifaceted interests. If you lack interest in a required thing, and it affects the entire career, isn't it a pity?</p>
<p>Friends, this is undoubtedly true, creating interest is a necessary condition for success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you can truly create and generate a strong interest, the taste is excellent and beautiful, even better than the taste your original interest gave you. Would you like to taste it?</p>
<p>Work hard to create your own interest!</p>

<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>To maintain physical survival, one needs to eat. But a person who only has a physical body and no spirit is just a walking corpse. To maintain spiritual survival, one needs to read.</p>
<p>However, reading is primarily about thinking. A person who has never thought or does not think, even if they have read thousands of volumes, their value is at most equivalent to a mobile bookcase.</p>
<p>Reading is just fragmentarily and sporadically collecting the thoughts and opinions of others. Moreover, these thoughts and opinions are not all beneficial to us. On the contrary, many contain strong toxins. We must use the power of thought to compare them, criticize them, organize them, filter out the toxins, and remove the dross to retain the essence. Only then can they become useful knowledge of our own. The difference between a polymath and a bookworm lies here: the former has put in some effort of thinking after reading, while the latter has not.</p>
<p>The reason why human culture has progressed is that humans have used the method of reading to collect the thoughts and opinions of others, able to chew them carefully, think slowly, and then combine them with profound observation and personal experience. Only after cultivating them for a considerable period of time can some truth be discovered, or new theories be created, so that human culture can take another step forward. Therefore, to acquire knowledge or elaborate on academics, reading and thinking are indispensable. To use an analogy: reading is collecting raw materials, and thinking is processing them artificially. Raw materials can only become excellent products after being polished by artificial work. So, if there are raw materials but a lack of artificial work, it is equivalent to having artificial work but a lack of raw materials. The result is nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must read, and we must also think.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Saving Wealth and Saving Knowledge <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Fang</p>
<p>Wealth and knowledge are indispensable elements of life. Among the two, knowledge is especially important, because saving knowledge is the basis for saving wealth. If there is no knowledge, how can wealth be saved? Therefore, saving wealth must first start with saving knowledge.</p>
<p>Saving knowledge should be based on self-cultivation, exploring the true meaning of morality from knowledge, such as the ability of diligence and frugality to nurture integrity, and then passing it on to the family, applying it to the country, so as to achieve the great path of cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. Moreover, it is necessary to explore the truth of the universe and strive for scientific knowledge, in order to achieve the purpose of saving the world and benefiting the group, then the true meaning of saving knowledge will not be betrayed.</p>
<p>Saving wealth should be based on diligence and thrift. If everyone handles matters with diligence and thrift, then saving wealth should not be difficult, and this is indeed a shortcut to saving wealth. People in middle age should focus on saving wealth, but when they are old, they should focus on distributing wealth. In our country, it is customary to pass this wealth on to descendants, but descendants cannot protect the ancestral property, and hate to see it squandered away. Therefore, when one is old, one must distribute this wealth to benefit society.</p>
<p>In summary, saving wealth and saving knowledge are the same as physical fitness and mental fitness. Physical fitness must first have mental fitness. With a healthy mind, it is easy to seek a healthy body. If there is a healthy body but no healthy mind, it is equivalent to having wealth but no knowledge. Therefore, people should first save knowledge, and then use their knowledge to save wealth, and then use their knowledge to distribute wealth, so they will not betray their saving of wealth and knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Evolution of Selfishness <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Wenzhong</p>
<p>When a person is standing at a station waiting for a tram, they always hope that the vehicles, crowded with passengers like sardines, will stop to let them squeeze in. Even if half of their body is inside the door and half is outside, using the "cloud riding" technique to hang on, they seem to be completely unconcerned!</p>
<p>Once inside the carriage, they hope that the tram will not stop and open its doors at stations along the way, shouting: "Crushed to death!... No one is getting off..."</p>
<p>But when they reach their destination station, they "change their style," raise their voice, and shout: "Hey! Ticket seller! Someone is getting off, open the door... Ah! Friend! Sorry! Move over..." If the tram does not stop, they utter complaints: "Damn it! I'm paying money but still have to take a detour, exhausting my legs."</p>
<p>From this ordinary event, in a short period of time, the selfish psychology of human beings is exposed without reservation.</p>
<p>Some people, seeing others' wallets swell because of speculation, very sternly satirize them for making a fortune from the country's misfortune, their conscience as black as coal. But once they themselves make a fortune through speculation, they say elegantly: "A small amount, it doesn't count for much." They know in their hearts: if I don't grab a slice of the pie now, when will I get such a good opportunity?</p>
<p>Alas! The heart of selfishness, where does it end?</p>

<p>I would rather I accommodate others than others accommodate me.</p>
<p>Temper should be restrained, and heart should be kind; body should be labored, and heart should be eased.</p>
<p>If it can be said but not done, do not say it. If it can be done but not said, do not do it. Conquer the strong with the soft, move people with sincerity, and subdue anger with reason. It is not difficult to deal with affairs. (In response to poverty relief)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Public Interest and Private Interest <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Leifeng</p>
<p>The so-called "interest" can be divided into two types: one is "private interest," and the other is "public interest."</p>
<p>Hoarding and speculating, raising prices, focusing only on making money for oneself, regardless of the life and death of others: this is "private interest," which is despicable and sordid.</p>
<p>Initiating social welfare undertakings, running charitable organizations, sacrificing one's own spirit, seeking the welfare of society and the interests of the country: this is "public interest," which is noble and sacred.</p>
<p>But in today's society, everywhere you look, there are people of the first kind; and people of the second kind? They simply do not exist. For the same word "interest," people who work for the first kind of "interest" are like maggots in a latrine, while people who work for the second kind of "interest" are like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. If things continue like this, how can society be peaceful, and how can the country prosper?</p>
<p>If the numbers of the first two kinds of people could be swapped, or even if one percent or one-thousandth of the first kind of people could become the second kind of people, that would be great. However, people's psychology always tends toward "self-interest." Moreover, the first type of people have been blinded by "private interest," lost their humanity, lost their reason. With themselves, who cares about others, who cares about society!</p>

<p>Life is essentially a long dream, a mystery. By the time the dream is awakened and the mystery is solved, it may be too late to deal with everything.</p>
<p>A person who speaks but does not act is the most useless. They deceive others, and they themselves are buried by their boasting. Conversely, a person who does not often open their mouth, who is taciturn, will instead do agile, amazing, and great things!</p>
<p>Before all things, the initiator is always driven by humanity, and it must not be created by being driven by others.</p>
<p>The light and charming singing voice: makes you listen and become intoxicated, numb, and it softens you, making you feel weak and unable to lift your limbs, sinking down. And the majestic and passionate singing voice: can make you rise to boundless heights and boundless enthusiasm; igniting your passionate ambition!</p>
<p>A positive person cannot avoid having a shadow side.</p>
<p>Often there are people who advance but then retreat again, even shrinking into the abyss. This is too terrible. Friends! You should affirm your firm will, exert your mind and body! Invigorate yourselves and continue to work hard: you cannot relax for a moment. Wipe your eyes clean and correctly examine everything, and move forward regardless of all gains and losses!

<h3 id="e66">Appeal for Disaster Relief in Chaoshan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yingshi</p>
<p>Chaoshan is located in the lower reaches of the Han River in eastern Guangdong. It was originally not a barren area, and fruit tree cultivation is especially abundant. Mandarins, sugarcane, longans, and lychees are its most notable products. However, because the land is mostly mountainous, the cultivated land is relatively narrow, and the population is dense, the annual grain production only accounts for one-half of the consumption. In the past, the deficit was supplied by Saigon, Bangkok, Yangon, and Wuhu. Since the Incident, shipping has been difficult, but grain ships still occasionally arrive. Although they cannot fully supply the shortage, middle and upper-class families can still live in peace. However, the poor are already commonly starving to death due to high grain prices.</p>
<p>Chaoshan rice is harvested twice a year. The first crop is sown in early spring and can be harvested in late summer. Since this spring, very few grain ships have arrived. The only hope is the late summer harvest. Unexpectedly, drought has been rampant, with no rain for several months, and the crops have withered and died, making the harvest hopeless. External assistance cannot be relied upon, and local production has become a pipe dream. Grain reserves are running out, and grain prices are soaring, with each stone reaching a price of about 6,000 storage certificates. People are starving to death, and the number must exceed a hundred every day. Eating children is still rarely heard of, but selling daughters and abandoning infants is already common. If relief is not provided quickly now, then in another three or two months, the grain reserves will be completely exhausted. The nearly two million residents of Shantou City, Chaoan, Chaoyang, and Chenghai counties in the peaceful area will all become starving corpses. Currently, in addition to the Guangdong Fellow Association having tearfully telegraphed the authorities for relief, it is hoped that people in society will urgently launch a relief effort. The Chaozhou people in Shanghai are not lacking in wealthy merchants, and it is hoped that they will quickly start saving their hometown. The following are several relief methods:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately organize a small relief organization to take charge of all relief matters.</p>
<p>(2) Collect large sums of money to purchase [grain] in the Changjiang River basin or Saigon, and then transport it to Shantou via special ship for relief. It is hoped that the Japanese authorities will provide convenience in grain procurement and allocate ships for transportation.</p>
<p>(3) For Chaozhou people in Shanghai who privately remit funds to Chaoshan to help their families, it is hoped that the authorities of the Central Storage Bank will provide convenience so that their families can survive while the grain reserves in Chaozhou have not run out and the relief grain has not arrived. (According to recent reports, readers have requested that the newspaper collect Chaoshan relief funds on their behalf. It is our duty to serve. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Xuliang of the Nanyang Enterprise Company donated 100 yuan first. Thank you.)</p>

<h3 id="e67">"Welfare Lottery" <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>In order to absorb idle funds and improve people's welfare, the National Government recently announced the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery." We still remember that on February 15 of this year, when Mr. Shiwadu Zhuangtailang, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, entertained news reporters to discuss the financial and economic issues of China after the war, he revealed that the National Government might consider issuing lottery tickets and rewarding prize-linked savings as one of the ways to recover currency in the future.</p>
<p>The "Welfare Lottery" is issued by the Central Reserve Bank and the Central Savings Association entrusted by the Ministry of Finance, so it is a national lottery. The power of its appeal is naturally extraordinary. The reason why it can appeal lies not in the future welfare issues, but in the current huge bonus. The target of its appeal lies not in the small number of wealthy classes, but in the majority of the middle and lower classes, because the methods and ways for the middle and lower classes to get rich are ultimately scarce and narrow.</p>
<p>Because of this, we cannot help but interpret its name and explain the welfare issue of the "Welfare Lottery." Article 9 of the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery" states: "The funds received from the Welfare Lottery, after deducting the bonus and all expenses, the remaining net profit shall be allocated to the Central Reserve Bank for special deposit and storage, for the purpose of improving people's welfare." Due to such a clear regulation, those who purchase "Welfare Lottery" should broaden their horizons, and should not take "the first prize winning a bonus of one million yuan" as their one and only goal, but should take the future common happiness of compatriots and the people as the object of their investment today. In this way, even if I do not get the prize tomorrow, the final welfare will ultimately be mine, because society is made up of small selves, and social welfare is my welfare.</p>
<p>Then, how should the words "People's Welfare" be interpreted? The elderly, weak, disabled, and poor in society have nowhere to turn, and there are countless cases of middle-aged unemployment and youth losing their studies. How to help them? How to resettle them? How to cultivate them? Which one is not a people's welfare issue? And which one is not a national economic issue?</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the people's welfare problem will be truly resolved due to the issuance of the "Welfare Lottery," then the "Welfare Lottery" will truly be immeasurable merit. We also hope that the wealthy classes will buy more "Welfare Lottery," because we do not rejoice in the small number of middle and lower classes getting the bonus, but cherish the large number of middle and lower classes getting the welfare.</p>

<p>In order to unify the procurement of rice and grains and centralize distribution, the Food Department, in addition to establishing the "General Administration for Public Grain Procurement and Sales," ordered various localities to organize joint rice and grain cooperatives and promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration, stating: "The Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration have been promulgated and implemented by the Executive Yuan on March 17th. The rice and grain merchants referred to in Article 3 of the above regulations also include miscellaneous grains. According to the categories of food materials under the jurisdiction of the Ministry as approved by the Executive Yuan, miscellaneous grains such as wheat, barley, naked barley, etc.; beans such as soybeans, peanuts, broad beans, red beans, etc.; sorghum, sesame, millet, corn, etc. Anyone engaged in the procurement, transportation, and sale of the above-mentioned miscellaneous grains, as well as intermediary trading or distribution and retail business, shall be considered a miscellaneous grain merchant and shall immediately comply with the Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration and apply for registration with the competent authorities. In addition to distributing this notice separately, we hereby enclose the Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration for your review and instruction to your subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Registration Required for Sales and Distribution Merchants</p>
<p>Provisional Regulations for Rice Merchant Registration. Article 1: Rice merchant registration shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. Article 2: Rice merchants shall not engage in business or join any rice and grain management organization without being approved and registered by the Ministry of Food in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.

<p>Issuance of Certificates and Strict Management</p>
<p>Article 8: After a rice merchant applies for registration in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article and is approved, the Ministry of Food shall issue a registration certificate without additional fees. Article 9: After rice registration, if there is a change of store owner or an increase or decrease in capital, it shall be submitted to the competent food authority for submission to the Ministry of Food for approval and registration, and a new certificate shall be issued, and the original registration certificate shall be returned to the Ministry of Food for cancellation. Article 10: When a rice merchant increases capital and applies for registration, he shall pay the registration fee according to the capital amount after the increase in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, and the registration fee previously paid may be deducted. Article 11: If the registration certificate is lost, it shall be immediately declared invalid in the newspaper, and an application for reissuance shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, and a handling fee of 50 yuan shall be paid. Article 12: If a rice merchant has any of the following circumstances, the registration shall be cancelled, and the registration certificate shall be recovered. The rice merchant shall not be allowed to apply for registration again. If there are other penalty provisions, the rice merchant shall still be subject to those provisions: (1) Intentionally making false reports regarding the items stated on the registration certificate. (2) Lending the registration certificate to others for use. (3) Committing fraud in the use of procurement certificates or transportation permits. (4) Engaging in manipulation or monopoly or other improper conduct. (5) Violating relevant food regulations or orders. When a rice merchant is subject to the foregoing penalties, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable. Article 13: Anyone who violates the provisions of Article 2 and operates privately shall be ordered to suspend business and shall be fined up to 1,000 yuan. Article 14: Anyone who violates the provisions of Article 9 and fails to apply for registration shall be ordered to suspend business and shall be fined up to 500 yuan.

<h3 id="e69">Current Reserve Funds Have Been Paid Up; Banks and Firms Are Allowed to Discount Bills with a Term of Seven Days <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In order to protect the interests of depositors, the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, requires all banks and firms to deposit their deposit reserve funds into the reserve account opened with the Central Reserve Bank. (1) No less than 5% of time deposits and special current deposits. (2) No less than 10% of current deposits. The amount of deposit reserve funds to be paid shall be determined according to the closing balance of each of the above-mentioned deposits at the end of each month, and shall be done before the end of each month. In order to comply with government laws and regulations, various banks and firms have paid up their deposit reserves for time deposits and special current deposits. However, the deposit reserves for current deposits were previously extended by the Ministry of Finance due to the tight money supply. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance approved the request of the silver and money industry and allowed them to borrow cash from the Central Reserve Bank with their deposit reserve passbooks in order to regulate finance. It was stipulated that banks and firms paying deposit reserve funds should issue promissory notes at 80% of their face value, which would be discounted by the Central Reserve Bank with a term of seven days and a particularly low interest rate. However, it was required that the industry association guarantee that the discounted funds were for legitimate business turnover needs. It is reported that various banks and firms have already reached a compromise for regulating finance, and there will be no difficulties in business turnover in the future. Therefore, the deposit reserves for current deposits have been paid up in accordance with legal regulations starting from June.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Company Re-registration Extended to the End of August <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The deadline for company re-registration, which had been extended to the end of May of this year, has expired again. Merchants and the public in various places have been unable to convene shareholder meetings due to an insufficient number of directors and supervisors, and relevant documents have been stored elsewhere, making it impossible to complete the application procedures in time. They have requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to extend the deadline for another ten times. After reviewing the situation, the Ministry deemed it to be true and, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of merchants and the public and assist industry and commerce in increasing production, approved another extension of three months for the re-registration, from June 1st to August 31st of this year, so that the companies concerned can register with the Ministry within the extended deadline. A public announcement was made yesterday, and a report was submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record, requesting the provincial and municipal governments to take note of this.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly fell sharply amid a generally stable trend. Although the Dragon Boat Festival has passed, the money supply remains tight, and the optimism of various parties after the holiday has begun to waver. New and old investors holding positions have turned cautious, and those seeking to sell have increased their supply due to the poor market sentiment. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy saw an unprecedented new high price in the morning, but it was difficult to maintain, and there were reports of a sharp decline in gold prices, so it saw a retreat, eventually closing slightly more than a yuan lower than last Saturday. New Asia Pharmaceutical also saw a slight consolidation; Minyi saw some trading at the support level; Sino-Western Pharmacy was slightly boosted. Among department stores, Sincere Company remained flat, while Wing On and National Goods Company both reversed from gains to losses; Underwear fell by several cents, while Jingfu Cedar Socks alone rose by nearly a yuan due to a certain buyer's massive purchases. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile's major support level was difficult to maintain for long, and both it and Mayar Silk Factory saw declines; Defeng Knitting Factory's new shares opened at 30% above par value. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and World Book Co. remained stable, while China Book Co. saw another sharp decline. Among public utilities, Chapei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison were the most stagnant, with the former's price slightly weak. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Great China Match Co. also saw little change. Transactions of Tung Yih Trust, Jiu An Industrial, and Chung Hsing Timber were similar to those before the holiday. New Yi Land saw stable buying interest at low prices, while most other stocks showed a flat or weak trend.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday morning, in the gray market for unified government bonds, Series C was slightly higher by a yuan, Series D remained the same, and the rest all increased slightly.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: In this city, large jewelry stores of the Great New Association are still exchanging ornaments at the limited price of 200 yuan per tael for handling fees. Prices in the market inside and outside the industry rose first and then fell back, but the increase was minimal, and transactions were not active. The market for fine silver remained the same.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: In the yarn market, demand seemed genuine after the Dragon Boat Festival, but sellers were holding firm, so yarn prices all rose sharply, but transactions remained sparse. In the cotton cloth market, sentiment was optimistic, and demand for Longtou fine cloth remained strong after the market opened in the morning, and the trend remained firm. However, Four Gentlemen Serge saw many people competing to sell, and the trend turned weak. As a result, Longtou fine cloth closed several yuan higher than before the holiday, while Four Gentlemen Serge closed several cents lower. Miscellaneous Grains: The supply of miscellaneous grains in the market was limited, and the sales floor was lively, so prices were slightly higher than before the holiday. There were futures transactions in bean cake.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Letter <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: In your newspaper on the 8th of this month, you published a news item about the Egg Industry Association strictly prohibiting members from smuggling eggs, which is not in accordance with the facts. Guotai Egg Company delivered 41 cases of chicken eggs and 9 cases of duck eggs to the Association on the 2nd of the month, as evidenced by the receipt. The shipment that arrived at Guohua Egg Factory on June 5th was not related to Guotai. In addition to inquiring with the Association, we are afraid that the public may not understand the facts, so we hereby write this letter requesting a correction. Sincerely, Guotai Egg Company.</p>
