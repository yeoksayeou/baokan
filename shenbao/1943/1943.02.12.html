<h3 id="c1">敬告日本的「中國通」與中國的「日本通」 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一個國家爲了適應複雜的國際關係，在平時，必須培養研究各國問題的專家，作爲政府當局決定國際政策的智囊與諮詢，實際上一國的國際政策都付託在他們手裏。數十年來，日本培養「中國通」的人才是十分努力的，至於中國的「日本通」人才比之日本，那眞是望塵莫及。過去中日關係的演化，這輩「日本通」和「中國通」直接或間接都有相當的貢獻。特別在這輩日本的「中國通」中間，當然有不少是可當「通」的名義而無愧的，他們對於中國的國情和民意，都有深知，有灼見，有熱烈的同情，有「光風霽月」「民胞物與」的大政治家的風度。</p>
<p>可是，最近十餘年來中日關係的漸漸惡化，固然主要的原因，在於英美的挑撥離間，而日本的「中國通」及中國的「日本通」，也都應該負起相當的責任。</p>
<p>就過去的事實來說，在「中國事變」之際，關於日本的國情，據說蔣介石曾徵詢當時駐日大使館的意見。而大使館的結論，是斷定日本國力決不能支持長期抗戰，斷定只要英美出而干涉，日本必能知難而退。當然大使館不能負起事變的責任，但是當時諸如此類的「日本通」，對於日本以一知半解而作爲政府的諮詢，直接間接使政府的對日政策走上錯誤的道路，却是不容否認的事實。</p>
<p>四五年來，重慶政權裏還有不少靠幾本日本書，或是幾份日文報，或是英美的日本宣傳品，而自命為日本通，參預機密，那會有什麼好政策參預出來。所以重慶政權在一年半前，估計ABC陣綫必能使日本軟化，估計日本決不對英美採取行動，這些都是重慶對日本認識不足，估計錯誤的結果。</p>
<p>同樣的情形，我們不能說在東京，在南京絕對沒有。</p>
<p>我們希望中日兩國不僅在目前而且永遠的提携合作，所以對於東京與南京政府，對於有志研究兩國國情而成為日本的「中國眞通」成為中國的「日本眞通」的諸位提供幾點意見：</p>
<p>今後兩國政府萬不可重用對於對方的國情民意僅有一知半解者。若是只憑一知半解，其弊害必有甚於根本不懂者，因為根本不懂，還不至於作出似是而非的決定，來陷中日雙方於痛苦，而一知半解者就會深陷於錯誤而不自覺。而必須培養與信賴要有眞知遠見的，要有「光風霽月」「民胞物與」的政治家風度與熱情的「眞通」。</p>
<p>如何可以做到「眞通」？</p>
<p>開宗明義第一章，就要對於中日兩大民族的永遠合作而奮鬥，有正確的認識，信念和決心，要對於對方的民族和人民有充分的愛慕，熱情和同情，有不惜犧牲一己而求兩大民族和民間增進了解與合作的熱誠與毅力。</p>
<p>其次，對於對方的歷史，地理，民族性，風俗，習慣，經濟，政治，及文化都有澈底的全面的調查和研究，特別要充分了解目前什麼為人民所仇惡，什麼為人民所喜愛，把握住中日民族永遠合作途徑的中心，求得兩大民族永遠和好的基本原則和方法，那麼才可無愧於「眞通」了。</p>
<p>再次，更應該全面的和從活動的方面去認識對方，去了解對方，要認識兩國都是在進步中，在跟着時代進步，都要從各方面在這種進步中去觀察，去認識，去了解，而尤其必要與大多數老百姓接觸。我們要知道明治維新和大東亞戰爭中的日本有了時間的進展，我們也應知道從義和團，三合會以來的中國民族運動民間組織，民間力量和目前的民族意識，已有了極大的進展，如果還死板地去尋求義和團三合會的殭屍，去連絡時代落伍的少數的官僚，政客，那麼，結果只會鑚入牛角尖裏去。</p>
<p>我們爲了增進中日兩國和兩大民族不僅在目前，而且永遠的提携合作，我們迫切地需求一切「日本通」和「中國通」的努力，增進兩國前途的幸福。</p>

<p>漢口十日中央社電　林宣傳　長蒞臨武漢後、於昨（十）日下午五時、假座本市五花賓館、招待中外記者團發表談話、計到中日各報社各電訊社、以及德國海通社、義國斯蒂芬尼社等新聞記者三十餘人、茲將問答各項問題記錄於后、</p>
<p>問、林部長此次蒞臨武漢感想如何、</p>
<p>答、此次本人來武漢、看到各方面情形、均有長足進步、昨天在武昌參加民衆大會、印象甚佳、尤其是今天在漢口參加大會、民衆六萬餘人、爲武漢事變以來所僅見、於此即可見中國前途光明、實堪期待、武漢爲革命策源地、民衆愛國思想甚爲濃厚、今後對於擔負興復中華保衛東亞之責任勢必更能勇往邁進、</p>
<p>問、中國對於收回租界撤廢治外法權、今後在行政措置上、作如何準備、</p>
<p>答、中國現正在研究改良司法制度、加强警察訓練、務於治外法權撤銷後、對友邦居留民之一切安全、更有確實相當之保障、</p>
<p>問、國府對於接收敵產、今後將作如何管理處置、</p>
<p>答、關於敵產接收問題、國府已組織敵產管理委員會、以財政部長兼委員長、其下或另設局處機關、大體機構如此、至於敵產處置辦法、約可分二大部門、（一）在工業方面、將所接收工廠、由實業部計劃運用、在可能範圍內、使其盡量發展、以資增加生產、（二）在文化方面、將從前英美文化侵略之工具、將從新整理、以發揮東方文化、中國文化、</p>
<p>問、今後對靑年運動、如何推進與發展、</p>
<p>答、今後新國民運動及靑少年團工作的推進、在參戰以後、更覺有加緊訓練的必要、我們原定計劃對於靑年運動的推進、以學生爲主體現爲適應戰時體制、在靑年學生以外、對於勤勞靑年、也有統一的必要、故於最近期內、即將兩系統合而爲一、即組織中國靑少年團、以下再分靑年與童子軍隊、</p>
<p>問、關於最近華北政務委員會改組經過原因、及今後之改進計劃如何、</p>
<p>答、華北政務委員會改組與各地方省市政府機構之改組相同、其原因完全爲實施戰時體制加强其行政機構、又因王揖唐委員長早有告退之意、此次呈請辭職、意甚堅決、因此國府乃另派朱深先生繼任華北政務委員長、</p>
<p>問、關於新國民運動國民黨及東亞聯盟各組織之使命如何、</p>
<p>答、新國民運動國民黨及東亞聯盟、在表面上看是幾個團體、各有各的性質、此實誤解、茲以簡單說明、先說新國民運動與東亞聯盟即如友邦日本大政翼贊會與興亞同盟一樣、一爲對內、一爲對外、目標不同、實質一樣、再關於黨的問題、一般國民仍以蔣介石時代把黨弄成衙門機關看法、現在也有人以爲如此、須知國民黨乃領導民衆、使每一黨員、在民衆的內層、作領導民衆的工作、不是以黨部來干涉行政、故汪主席領導的黨員須深入民間、對黨的主義、蔚爲中心思想、造成共同的信仰、國民先能發展、新國民運動也能發展、同時黨以外、還有其他各黨派無黨無派的民衆、爲使他們能體會東亞聯盟的精神、受新國民運動的訓練、國民黨是負有重大的責任的、</p>

<p>（朝日新聞松平特派員南京專電）記者承報道部之介紹，與大阪陸軍記者團一行，同赴汪主席公館，得有瞻仰在氏之機會。承汪主席在政務鞅掌中，親自接見，暢談參戰後之國府施政方策，增加生產，建軍等項問題。以下爲記者與汪主席之問答：</p>
<p>問：關於參戰後之國府根本方針？</p>
<p>答：最重要者，即須認淸誰爲東亞之同志，與誰爲東亞之叛徒？大東亞戰爭當初，國府猶冀渝方乘此反省，來歸和平中國之陣營。然彼等甘冒不韙，自趨東亞叛徒之道。其故態不改，仍與英美共同作戰，或締結不單獨媾和之條約，使吾人大感失望。但吾人猶存姑息，在去年一年中，力促渝方反省，無如其執迷不悟，辜負此上片好心，吾人之努力，遂成泡影。</p>
<p>國府爲明確昭示立塲，並團結束亞同志起見，故決心參戰，力量雖微，但願竭盡全力站於參戰之立塲。今後之施政，旨在中國民衆之大同團結，完遂大東亞戰爭，淸楚認識此即救中國之道。指導人民同爭大東亞戰爭之勝利。以上爲國府施政之根本方針。相信除此以外，別無解放中國之道。幸賴日本帝國政府接受吾人之至誠，多方援助，至使吾人得以自動奮起參戰。</p>
<p>日本帝國政府爲使中國成爲近代國家，不惜予以更有力之協助，先交還租界，撤廢治外法權，國府對此深表感謝。促進新運，爲根本方策之一，俾能先從精神上指導民衆。</p>
<p>問：關於增加生產及改革政治機構，如何實施？</p>
<p>答：此事即從以上之根本方針出發，與加强治安同爲重要問題。開發重要資源，協助大東亞戰爭，實爲當務之急。不特爲時局所需求，且能確立東亞之自給經濟，而解決中日相同之經濟問題，由此觀之，極應重視，今日上午之第三次國防會議席上，準備議定具體之經濟政策，刻因尚在擬議之中，故未能詳述。</p>
<p>關於改革政治機構，誠如上次之發表，先行加强中央政治機構之一元化，繼再加强地方政治機構之一元化，將省委制改爲省長制。</p>
<p>問：關於參戰後之建軍目標？</p>
<p>答：以興復中華，保衛東亞爲建軍之根本方針，關於其具體要點，姑舉數點說明：</p>
<p>第一，現在國府軍隊之素質，國軍中有十分之八九爲渝軍或渝方游擊隊中所抽出，是以此項軍隊，因過去之關係，環境各異，今後建軍，注重於如何整理此項軍隊而組織，力求貫澈精兵主義，去年一年中，抽調全國將校至中央陸軍將校訓練團，灌輸「國家意義」，建「設大東亞意義」，祗有一月，全部將校即可訓練完畢。本年度將更進一步，整理軍隊，加以訓練，如將整理兩字之意義認爲淘汰主義，實爲極大錯誤。凡來參加和平軍者，雖一兵一卒，決不使其失望，否則抱有參加和運希望之渝軍，勢必裏足。所謂整理者，規定三種標準實施，挑選兵士中之最優秀份子，加以整理，編爲正規軍，給予優越待遇。其次者，予以稍輕之任務、編入保安隊。第三，對於毫無兵士素質者，保證其生活令其安居民衆生活，短期內即將根據此三種標準整理軍隊，一時雖不能獲得多數精兵，但相信將來必能獲得一部份精兵。暫時須先致力於訓育精兵。</p>
<p>在未達到此項理想前之第二目標，至少國府軍隊須確保和平區域。藉以减輕日軍之後方負擔，第三，和平軍能完全確保和平區時，渝方之軍士等，或許樂願來歸，此即第三目標。</p>
<p>以上所論，均爲連帶性之問題，決不能單獨着想，例如增加生產，開發資源而加强經濟力量？即能使建軍順利，　此一例，即知政治，軍事，經濟之推動，完全循此軌道而進，切不可誤解此點。（任：譯自二月六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>關於統制會，營團，國策會　的下級幹部，應有必要以上的報酬的問題，西尾末廣氏在五日的衆議院預算總會要求在目下的時期「財政界上，現在不是討論酬報的均衡與否的時期。」在苛烈的決戰體下，促使全部國民的思想應集中於爭取勝利的覺悟，這是値得注意的見解。向勝利之途邁進的過程，有賴於國民生活的愈趨緊張，在這時代，應毫無躊躇地覺悟到「有能力的人不計報酬」，這才是全部國民所應力行的問題，爲爭取勝利，全體國民應該坦白無私，潔身奉公。</p>

<p>池畸氏並不贊同保存上海的國際性的方法，倒並不是因問題的過於細小而不注意，池崎氏的意見，乃是應否附有條件的交還租界。與靑木大東亞相交換意見的結果，所謂國際性這一名詞的解釋，這國際性的內蘊，應完全芟除英美侵略東亞的殘滓，由我們來建設。（翔　譯自二月六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>鹽爲日常必需品，除糧食外，其重要性可居於第二位，且爲工業的重要原料，可以左右工業之發展，所以其量雖多，其來雖易，而其重要性實不容忽視。我國食鹽最大來源當推海鹽。福建本爲產鹽區域之一，戰前之鹽產，不但足以自給，其厘鹽之一部份，且可運銷於潮汕一帶，戰事發生之後，因而更增加　對於隣省的擔負。於是福建之鹽務，不但關係於本省，而且兼及於贛湘各省，成爲重要經濟問題之一。</p>
<p>閩省之鹽塲，在淸末爲十三塲，至現在共有十塲，爲莆田縣之前下塲，莆田塲，惠安縣之山腰塲，晉江縣之潯善塲，同安縣之蓮河塲，東山縣之詔浦塲，福淸縣之福淸塲，以及年來設立的南　塲，溫江塲，詔浦塲。在這十塲內，就地區上，我們可以很明顯的看出產地，均偏於閩省之南部，這自以氣候較便於晒鹽之故。就過去一年的統計，全部鹽塲，計有鹽戶五千四百九十一戶，鹽塲數爲二十二萬九千九百二十四處，從事晒鹽工作之人數約有五萬人，而合運輸食鹽之人工計算，則在二十萬人以上。就官方統計，本省產鹽之最高額爲民國十八年的年產量三百多萬市擔，而抗戰後三年之統計，二十六年爲一百二十七萬市擔，二十七年二百萬零四萬市擔，二十八年爲二百三十一萬市擔，而三十年之產量更降至一百四十萬市擔。這數字似表示鹽產量的降低，然而鹽爲日常必用品，食鹽若不足，一定將引起不可避免的紛亂。而吾人只見鹽產數的下降，而未曾聞有食鹽不足之現象，則鹽產量下降，可有二種眞確的解釋：</p>
<p>其一，運輸不便，鹽務局不能充足供給食鹽之故，私鹽日見擴大其用途，就現狀說，官鹽每斤的價格爲二元四角，而私鹽　在八元以上，因需要而提高之私鹽的價格，更增加了鹽梟的利慾，於是在官方報告上我們看到了鹽產量的降低，自從實行計口授鹽以後，本省以前的引岸制度，已自取銷，省內的食鹽，均由本省各水陸運輸路綫運送，由縣鹽務所轉賣於各鄉鎭之鹽子店，而後按照戶口而賣給民衆。惟以運輸困難之故，閩南之價格旣不同於閩北，而分配額在表面上雖相同，實際則相差甚巨，因每人半斤的食鹽，在城市間有醬油，蝦油可以代用，自不感困難，而鄉間專靠此半斤之鹽來維持，其不足之數量定甚可觀。閩南一帶接近鹽塲，所以私鹽之價亦較低，若閩北各地，么鹽之價常在十元以上，民衆欲維持不淡食，自覺困難萬狀，目前省鹽務當局有鑒及此，已計劃先就永安至南平一綫，月銷鹽增加至每口一斤。這當然是民衆所希望的，而全省民衆更希望其能遍於本省每一角落。內銷的情形，因交通而發生了嚴重的問題。至於外銷亦由於同一原因而常陷於困頓。民國三十年的統計，外銷鹽每月六萬多担，供給江西，湖南兩省，運輸的路綫有三條，均由閩省運至江西，而後自江西轉運於湖南，其路綫爲自閩南雲霄經廣東往江西，自閩西長汀入江西的瑞金，和由閩北的邵武運往江西的光澤，這三條幹路，有半數以上的路程均得依靠陸上的運輸，這情形不但增加了鹽的價格，而且减少了鹽的　量。驛運代替汽車運輸之後，雖不至受汽油壓車　的限制，而運輸之時間與效力更加困難，而　鹽之出，有旺季與淡　之分，這樣更使食鹽有靑黃不接之情形，這些，都値得注意和研究。由於環境上的需要，閩省鹽政當局於九月間在閩南召開增產會議，　論增加鹽產量的各種問題。預定明年度產量增加至六百萬市担，以半數以上供給隣省。在增產會議之後，並於泉州召開會議，討論運輸及緝私等問題，各議決案已次第在進行中。爲着便於管理及監督起見，省鹽務總局及稽核所已由永安的貢川搬在福州，這些，都表示省鹽務當局已着手整頓，這是値得人們的注視的。我們當然不能諱言今日鹽政之尚有亟待改進的地方，鹽質之雜，稽核人員當負其全責，就城市與鄉村而　，二者之間需鹽程度大有不同，則其分配量亦値吾人之注意。至若因交通問題而减少對於隣省的供給，則鹽晶之提煉而减少重量，似亦値研究和注意。福建爲產鹽省份，人民雖不至有淡食之虞，而鹽分不足所引起之恐慌，已普遍於鄉村間，這實値得管理鹽務者的注意。（三十一年十二月廿日寄）</p>

<p>— 蔭良</p>
<p>新春團拜會座談稿</p>
<p>綱要　（一）量大福大。（二）小我與大我。（三）保富不如不富：富　方能富已。（四）細水長流，有餘不盡。</p>
<p>我因為反對習俗的　費，所以家裏十幾年來過年過節，都同平時一樣，不添菜，不請客。我不到人家去拜年拜節，人家也不到我家裏來回拜。我常常說，我天天過年卅，同時也大天過年初一；因為我天大戰戰兢兢地結算精神上物質上的收　賬，同時也天大快快活活地和朋友談談笑笑。起先實行這個主張的時候，親友們還有「未　免俗」的，我抱定宗旨，來而不往，後來大家索性也不來了。我很明白「來而不　」是「非禮也」.可是因為我的沒有禮物，却省下了不少親友們的浪費，我自己也減少了許多金錢上時間上的支出。今年親友們發　團拜會，趁休假的機會，歡聚一堂，喝一杯清茶，談談各人的心得，我十二分的贊成　這個辦法是值得提倡的，所以叫我來說幾句話，更　得非常的高興。</p>
<p>今天的題目是母親出的。母親因為我這幾年來很　了些人生誓　　以為我一定有些心　。可是說來團體，　於人生誓　研究，我還是一　小學生，要有什麽　得，如何容易。今天在諸位親友面　　　把我所有到的，聽到的和　　　　一個報導，聽到的和　　　大家來指正。</p>
<p>（一）量大福大</p>
<p>新年裏應　說吉利語，我恭祝諸位新　多福。可是，我　奉告諸位一個多福的法門，你要福人，　得量大。</p>
<p>福字的解釋很抽象，很籠統·禮記祭統說，福者　也，備者　　之名也，無所不順者　謂　。可是事實上天下那里有百順而無一逆的境遇，人間那里有　所不順的身　。所以福的解釋，據我想來，　重於精神方面的多，着　於物質方面的少。福大的人，處順　精神自然非常愉快，處逆境精神也是一樣的愉快。換句話說，精神愉快。是福，福就是精神愉快。</p>
<p>量人的意義很明白，俗語說：宰相肚裏好撐船」.又說：「能容乃人」.把這個　容　字去說明　大　字，是　好沒有的。。文　　　　就是房子，谷所是由谷。房子可以容納　是大。氣　　　容納一切的就是大量。俗語說：　　　度句容，也　這個　　。</p>
<p>為往　　的人能夠　大。因為　　的人能夠容納一切，　對於順　的　　　　　　　　　聖人心如止水」，俗語說：沈得　氣」.　有「心如止水」的人，方才能夠沈得着氣」；惟有「沈得着氣」的人，方才能夠得　永久的精神愉快。沈不着氣的人遇到逆境，一定怨天尤人　怨天尤人的人，精神上一定得不愉快。所以量人才能福大。</p>
<p>一個人的氣量並不是生下來的大的，大氣量不是一朝夕能夠成功的，他是經過許多的經騐，許多的體會，日積月累而成功的。所以賢如管仲，孔子尙　說：「管仲之器小哉」.不過有　個要點，可以一化小量為大量　，我要特　提出來談談。</p>
<p>，要開放　界。我們都知道三家村學穷，識見淺薄，胸襟狹隘。他是自　不凡，　可　　；遇到不順的時候，就要打孩子罵人。爲什麽呢？　　限於他的三家村，他　一隅，不懂得村之外還　鄉，鄉之外還有鎮，鎮之外還有市，以至國家·世界·整個宇宙。假如他的眼界能夠推　同宇宙一樣的大，他就知道自己多渺小，他對於一切自然只有　量　容納；他對於拂逆，自然就能不介於懷；他的識見自然　明，他的胸懷自然灑落。</p>
<p>第二，要注重客觀。孟子說：「矢人惟恐不傷人，函人惟恐傷人」；又說；「富歲子弟多賴，凶歲自弟多暴」.矢人和函人同樣是忍，但是各人的目的不同；富歲子弟和凶歲子弟同樣是子弟，但是各人的品性不同。爲什麽呢。完全是客觀環境的關係。原來世界上的人事都是受客觀環境的影響，所以我們不必喜愛，亦不必怨恨，我們要寬容。老子說：「聖人常善救人，故無棄人；常善救物，故無棄物」。真是至理名言。</p>
<p>三，要　個了解事物。古往今來，上下四方，無數的人，無數的事，表面上好像紛紜錯綜，其實都有一　一定的循環規律。這個規律就是科學家和哲學家所要研究的。研究無綫電的人，懂　電　　的關係；研究有聲電影的人，懂　光和聲的關係；研究物理的人，懂得　　　光的關係；研究人生的人，懂得人事循環變化的道理。佛家說：生住異滅。　如草木，逢春　芽　之生，花　葉出　之住，逢秋枯落　　個規律，就能夠知道整個事　的變化，都是「勢所必然，　有必至」，值不得　怒愛惡的。老子說：「君子坦蕩蕩，小人常戚戚」.惟有知常的人方才能　容，亦惟有坦蕩蕩的人方才　　稱為君子。</p>
<p>（二）小我與大我</p>
<p>研究人生哲學的人，大都反對這個「我」。儒家講克已，道家講無我，佛家講去我　，基督講博愛，基本的觀念都要消滅這　私「我」。</p>
<p>爲什麽要反對「我」？爲什麽要消滅這個私「我」？因為「我」根本是罪惡，而從這個罪惡所滋生出來的禍害可以影響於整個世界，整個人類。讀歐洲歷史的人都知道十八世紀是近代思想的七點，近　思想的出發點在乎「我」的自覺。從這時起個人主義抬了頭，政治上慢慢地轉變到民主，經濟上更用這民主政治的招牌，轉變到自由資本主義。但是結果什麽樣？一二百年來我們只見「我」「你」的爭奪，「我」「你」的壓迫，「我」「你」的剝削。</p>
<p>要知道一個人呱呱墜地的時候，是不知道有我的。等到知道有我的時候，已經有許多的「你」，許多的「他」抚養着，保護着，教育着。並且知道有我，同時也知道有你有他。假使把一個人拘禁在四無人跡的孤島上，沒有你，沒有他，我就是根本不能夠存在。這個一己的「我」，我叫做「小我」,；這　我以外的「你」「他」，我叫做「大我」.大我和小我的一部份。大我然後有小我，沒有　我，大我也就根　消</p>
<p>大我的範圍有　有狹。就一個家　論，個　是，我，家庭最大我。　　一個民　論，個人是小我，民　是大我，就一個國家論，　末民族和家庭都是小我，國家是大我，就世界論，　　國家是小我，　　是大我。一個人的知識越高，大我的範圍越大，一個人的眼光越遠，大我的範圍亦越　。</p>
<p>從大我小我的關係裏，我們可以發見一個道德的最高標準。我們可以說，凡是有利於大我的行為，都是好的，，道德的；凡是有害於大我的，都是不好的，不道德的。有些事，對於大我有利的，對於小我也有利的，當然應該就做。有些事，對於大我有利的，對於小我有害的，依照大我的立塲也應該就做。同時，大我的範圍愈廣，道德的程度愈高。所以佛家的普度眾生，耶穌的博愛，儒家的四海一家，世界大同，日本「掩八　為一宇」都是道德上的最高標準，任何人都應該有的理想。</p>
<p>我方才，有些事，對於大我有利而對於小我有害的，也　該就做。話雖如此說，事實並不如此。因為有利於大我的事，決沒有有害於小我的道理。原來大我就是小我，大我的利害就是小我的利害，所以表面上雖然就像有害於小我，實際裏假如大我有利，小我　不會有害的。老子說：「既以為人已愈有，既以與人已愈多」，俗語；「予人方便，自己方便」，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>（三）保富不如不富，富羣方能富已</p>
<p>最近　了聶雲　先生的保富法，心里很有多感。聶　　人不富，並且更進一步勸人把富　　的心思，移　富大眾方面去，我　　聶先生真意，只有兩點：第一，保富　如不富：第二，富羣方能富已。</p>
<p>財富是沒有子保守的。老子說：「金玉滿，　之能守」：又說：「多藏必厚亡」.這是理論，說的明明白白。至於事實　聶先生說得更清楚，最後結論是：「數十年所見富人，後代全已衰落；六十年來文武大官世家，都已衰落，後人不興」.因為私人財富是一種罪惡。聶先生說：「貪財不貪財，關係一人的利益幸福甚大，發財便能造罪不貪財方能造福」，所以富家的必貧，等於最煩之難逃法網。財富沒有絕對的標準，替財富下定義很困難；不過財富至少含有兩種意義，一·有；二·有餘。可是因為你的有，就發生人家的無３；因為你的有餘，就發生人家的不是。並且，因為少數人的有」，就有多數人的「無」,；少數人的「有　」就有多數人的「不足」.這是明白的事實，所以天道要有餘以補不足，使世界上無形中有一個制裁。惟有不富的人也不受這個制裁。所以聶先生說：「惟有不肯發財上進。林文忠公的禁烟，就是一個最好的例。他不願因為個人的發財，遺害全國的國民，死　家無　蓄，死後死孫代代書香不絕，可見保富不如不富。</p>
<p>但　人生來就有慾望的，任何人都是，望永久地吃飽着暖，住好房子，有好娛樂。怎麼能　到這個目的呢？我說，很簡單。　有大家能夠吃飽着暖的時候，你方才能夠永久地吃飽着暖；只有大家能夠住好房子，有好娛樂的時候，你方才能夠永久地住好房子，有好娛樂。只有大我的利益是小我的永久利益，小我單獨的利益是不嫩夠永久的。華嚴經　；若令眾生生歡喜者，則令一切如來歡喜」.聶先生說：「欲求得福，須多造福於人」.又說：「有官極大，發財的機會幾多，而不肯發財，念念在救濟眾人的，子孫發達最昌盛，最長久」.范文正公不願意把蘇州南園做私人的家園，而捐做蘇州的學宮，使蘇州子弟都能夠念書，同時他的子弟也就永久能夠念書。這就是儒家所說，獨樂不如眾樂，百姓足，君孰與不足」的道理，在現在這個環境下看來，更覺得親切有味。可見得先要使大家發財，個人方才能偶享受財富的樂趣，所以說：「富羣方能富已」。</p>
<p>（四）最後我想貢獻諸位一個做人之道。曾文正公說：「處此亂世，雖大富大貴，亦　不住，惟勤儉兩字，可以持久」.我說的細水長流，就是勤；有餘不盡，就是儉。</p>
<p>到過天台雁蕩，看過瀑布的人，都能夠欣賞他的偉大。　過海寗，看過秋潮的，都能夠欣賞他的雄壯。到過杭州，　過　　十八溪的人，都能夠欣賞他的消趣，可是，瀑布的　有時要竭，水竭了，瀑布也就不能未偉大了；海寗的秋潮，舊曆八月十八日最大，其餘的時候也就不雄壯了；只有九溪十八　的細流，不舍晝夜地永久不失掉他的清趣。</p>
<p>小時候時，　到山重水複疑無路，柳暗花明又一　」，這兩句，想不出什麽樣的樂趣。後來每逢　山的時候，常常遇到這樣的境界，心中有說不出的愉快，方才體味出這個詩意。因此，對於一目了然的山景，毫不留戀；對於若隱若現的峯嵐起伏，徘徊而不忍去。爲什麽呢？因為一個是看得盡的，一個是看不盡的。</p>
<p>細水的可愛，在於他的長流；他的所以能夠長流，因為他的水細。大家曉得做人要勤，不是一下子的勤，而是永久的勤。譬如登山，一下子走得很快，那末走到半山，一定要「五　　　」，不能行動；會上山的人，總是一步一步地，慢慢走上去，到得山頂，毫不覺累。等山如此，讀書亦然，做人亦然。諸葛亮說：「寗靜以致遠」，　有寗靜的人方才能夠致遠，所以勤字的工夫，就在細水長流。</p>
<p>大家都曉得做人要儉，並且大多數指的是金錢方面，其實無論精神上面，身體方面，金錢方面都要儉。譬如踢球，不會的人，上得塲來，東奔西走，等不到上半時終了，先已「氣喘如牛」，難乎為繼」.會踢球的人，從不肯把他的氣力用得太過，他只是女安靜靜，守着腳根，踢到終塲，還是神色自若，餘男可買。譬如唱戲，　鑫培的可貴，並不是一出塲就是音「入雲」，他只是愛惜他的嗓子，慢慢地愈唱愈有勁道，叫聽戲的人們，直到散塲，「餘音　　」還留下一個有餘不盡」印象。道家說神太勞則竭，形太勞　敝」。其實。何事情，太勞的結果，總是不能長久回；惟有有餘不盡　，方才能夠不竭不敝，方才能夠長久，所以儉字的工夫，就在有餘不盡。</p>
<p>說了許多拉雜話，就此打住，希望大家指教，恭賀大家新春快樂！</p>

<p>英文泰唔十報云、公共租界及法租界兩衛生處處長田代良顯與波爾達、昨晨在工部局衛生處共同商討關於防止居民因食河豚而中毒事件之發生、</p>
<p>嚴密注意魚類來路</p>
<p>本年內公共租界因食河豚而致死者、已有五十人、工部局衛生處長田代良顯昨復向記者表示、要求公眾勿向攤販購買河豚、據云前次大批居民中毒、其原因乃由於小販稱新年假期內將河豚偷運之故、據田代指稱、河豚係由吳淞經浦東運入楊樹浦區　以致大批工人有所購　、工部局衛生處與中央魚塲當局、現正合作嚴密注意所有魚類之來路、</p>
<p>秘密供售決　嚴懲</p>
<p>據云、衛生處稽查晨現每日向各區可能私售河豚處、實行調查常有大批河豚由攤販及負販予以充公及破壞、自工部局衛生處禁止河豚出售於公共租界　、一般小販、其販售河豚之路、因被截斷、乃向他處販售運滬、惟當局業已決定予此等違法者以嚴懲、至於其秘密供售地點、則當局已可向醫院內之中毒者探悉</p>
<p>租界當局合作查禁</p>
<p>田代良顯又　露、謂蘇州河以內、並未發生不幸事件、且公共租界業與法租界衛生處合作、進行查禁出售河豚情事、又據其指出、河豚於煮食之前、必須完全洗淨其血同時又據楊樹浦醫院方面透露、於舊曆新年中、以河豚佐餐而中毒之一〇七名工人、自於前日以前有二十人不治身死外、其餘八十七人經過尙為良好、雖有若干名在危險狀態中、　生命或可無礙、又法公董局衛生處波爾達、於昨日下午接見大美晚報記者稱、法當局將協同公共租界衛生處當局禁止河豚之私售、法租界於過去　曾禁止出售河豚、故並未發現河豚中毒案件、且事實上法租界菜塲魚類、係由華中魚塲運來、故該魚塲禁止河豚販售後、法租界菜塲、遂亦無出售河豚可能、</p>

<p>— 雲間白蕉</p>
<p>他的北碑南帖論裏說：</p>
<p>「古石刻紀帝王功德，或為卿十銘德位，以佐史學，是以古人書法，未有不託金石以傳者。秦石刻曰金石刻明白是也。前後漢　碑盛興、書家輩出。東漢山川廟墓，無不刊石勒銘，最有矩法。降及西晉北朝，中原漢碑材立，學者慕之，轉相摩習。唐修晉書南北史傳，于名家書法，或曰善　書，或曰善　草，或曰善正書，善楷書，善行草，而皆以善　書者為尊。當年風尚，若曰不善　，是不成書家矣。一</p>
<p>帖者始終卷帛之署　，（見說文）後世凡一　半紙，珍藏墨蹟，皆歸之帖。今閣帖也，非碑也。目以南朝　禁刻碑之事，是以碑　極少，（見昭朝文選）　帖是尙，全變為真行草書，無復　古遺意。……東晉民間摹　，多出　匠之手，而字跡尙與　相近，與蘭亭　殊，非持風流者所能變也。</p>
<p>同時他又說：</p>
<p>「北朝碑字，破體太多，特因字雜分　，兵戈之間，無人講習，遂致六書混淆，鄉　虛造。」——北碑南帖論中語。</p>
<p>「北朝族望質朴，不尙風流，拘守舊法，罕肯通變，惟遭時離，體格猥　，……破體太多，官為顏之　，江式等所糾止。　　南北書　　中　。</p>
<p>他又承認：</p>
<p>（短　長卷，意能揮灑，則帖擅其長；</p>
<p>（二）界格方嚴，法書深刻，則碑據其勝。—皆北碑南帖論中語。</p>
<p>可見他的碑帖長短論，說得非常開明。不過我人從這兩篇文字中看來，他的南北分派的立論，不論從地域上，或就人的單位來說，他作的系統的說法，不能圓滿，恐怕事實上也無從圓滿，而且會越弄越糊塗的。—因為地域與人的分　，與各家書品的分　要南北劃分得清清楚楚，其困難或不可能正和其他學術方面的劃分南北派或某派某派差不多。我忍試就碑帖的本題而說，比方拿顏魯公的作品來講，家廟碑、麻姑仙壇記、顏勤禮等等是碑：裴將軍爭座位祭　稿、三表等等是帖。就人說，他是山東人，　北派。就字體說，他的字近　鶴銘，　屬南派。現在姑目不　魯公，便就在阮氏兩文中的鐘、王、歐、褚諸人，他的分　不是已頗費安排而難於妥帖嗎？至於他說到帖的統一天下，歸功於帝王的愛好，這也　是見得一方之說。—此一理由，下面再詳。—阮說開了風氣後，到了包，康兩人，索性　立起「尊碑　帖」一尊魏　唐的旗幟來了。他們雖然　　阮氏，　是已經走了樣！他們的人的學術，既然　疏，態度又很偏激，修辭又不能立誠，好以已意逞為　說，很多好人之所惡，惡人之所好。終欲以石工陶匠之字，方駕鐘、王、如慎伯論說，好作某出自某的源流論，說得似乎推本窮源，實則疏於史學，鑒空荒謬：長素把、像中最惡名者像齊碑隽修羅、隋碑阿史那都贊為妙絕，龍門二十品中又深貶優填王一種，都是偏僻之論！</p>
<p>為甚麼說　、康　人抑帖的醉最大論據是祖述阮是呢？阮氏怎樣呢？在他的南北書派論中有一段：</p>
<p>「宋帖輾轉　勒，不可究詰，漢帝秦臣之　，並由虛造，鐘王　謝，豈能如今所存　朝諸碑　書丹原石哉！」</p>
<p>本來世人厭舊喜新的心理是古今人未必不相及的：以耳代目的輕信態度，也是古今不肯用心眼腦子的人所相同的。所以是實是屬於一種研究性的文字，人們便認為鐵案。阮氏的兩篇大文，大概　伯，長素只讀了以上幾句，一時觸動了靈機，便好奇逞私大事鼓吹，誓言阿好；而後人又目為定論。其實關於閣帖的謬誤，洽帖的如宋黃伯思便有閣帖刊　，清梁山舟有淳化秘　　帖考正，都在阮氏以前，阮氏當然已經讀過了的。至於碑的作為　　　，本來就相帖一　情形。而　本的好壞，那是洽帖的人和治碑的人同樣注意考究的。</p>
<p>為甚麼說包康兩人說辭不　立其誠？因為很希望的　們叫人家都　學碑學魂，而自述得力所在，津津樂道的却正是帖！—見述書篇（慎伯）述學片（長素）—那不是正合着俗語所謂自打嘴吧麼？</p>
<p>我往年讀慎伯，長素　論著，頗欲作文糾　，後見朱大可君有論書斥包慎伯康長素一文，（東方雜誌二十七卷　二號中國美術專號）真可謂先得我心。那篇文章實在是有功於書學，他的論證，非常切實。原文相當長，這裏不去引述。諸位研究到這個問題？正是一片很　的參考資料。</p>
<p>我對於碑帖的本身，大體很同意於阮氏的見解。因為我忍學帖，應知道帖的短處；學碑，也應明白碑的短處。取碑的長處，補帖的短處：取帖的長處，補碑的短處，這正是學者應有的精神！對於兩者比較的說法，我是以為：</p>
<p>A碑帖的本身價值，並不能以直接書石與否而有所軒輊。原刻初榻，不論碑與帖，同樣是可貴的。</p>
<p>B碑刻書丹於石，經過石工的大刀闊斧椎鑒全不失原書毫釐，也難以相信。</p>
<p>C翻刻的帖佳者，尚存　型，　朝碑的原刻，書法儘多，出書家之手，或者見多出於不甚識字的石　之手。</p>

<h3 id="c96">我們需要熱情！ <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 遠濤</p>
<p>近來為了節省煤　，常常用冷水洗臉，但在天氣過冷時候，也偶爾用些熱水——這在我個人，差不多已成了習慣了，不過習慣　已養成，而我臉神經分辨「冷」「熱」的感覺却依然存在，絲毫不曾麻木。所以，每　晨起之後，以一張　從被裏鑽出來的熱烘烘的臉，突然同那幾乎接近　　的冷水去　，其不受臉部神經之歡迎，乃是　當然　事。</p>
<p>反過來說，如果我洗臉的水是熱氣蒸　的，　然分量極少，同我的熱臉接觸起來，也往往「相得益彰」之感。但俏便這水的熱度是溫吞吞的，比周圍的空氣固然要熱一些而比自己的臉的熱度，遠不如，——那時的洗臉，在我也是覺得怪無趣的。</p>
<p>人　世故而，以熱面去磁冷臉，這是一件多麼使人熱烘烘的乘興而來，而我則冷冰冰的便他敗興而去，這非但是不厚道，而且近於殘忍。所以，凡是宅心忠厚，而又善於應變的人，對於人之來者，雖不能每次都是「有求必應」，使人人稱心滿意而去，但最低限度，他必然能從自己的　顆熱烘烘的心裏，發射出一些為對方所極其需要的熱情來，使對方的那顆殷切期待着的心至少能得着一些熱情的意問，和指示，不致於　　冰回去。</p>
<p>人與人相交，最不能缺少的一種要素是熱情。熱情仿佛是一團暖氣，如同冬日之可愛，有了它，人類間　不致於感覺冷酷，而有和　如春之感。</p>
<p>記得外國的影片，有一張名叫「冷面人」的。幸而它是一張滑稽片，使人看了不過哄然一笑而已，如果世界上真有這樣的人，那該是一件多麼使人掃興的事！因為人世間的冷面人仿佛是一個不需要的冷氣管，不絕地把它的冷氣傳佈於人世，使人類社會間起了可怕的凍化作用。相反的，我們需要的是熱情奮發的人，一團和氣的人，和笑口常開的人，因為唯有他們才能使冷酷的社會變為熱烘烘的社會。</p>
<h3 id="c97">米開蘭基羅的工程　世界著名藝術家的書翰之一 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 古心譯</p>
<p>前因　米開蘭基羅·　奧　洛提（Aliehelmmgolo　Buonarroli）生於一四七五年，他的繪畫和　　，有着大胆的　作性和没有瑕疵的技巧，因此在二十一盏的时候，就享到了　名。教皇朱理第二（）召他到羅馬去的時候，他是一個冷酷而在政治上抱有野心的人，對於藝術還沒有多大的了解，不過他知道他要求些什麽。這時他被召去建築一個墳墓，一個與他身份相稱的墳墓。　所提出來的計劃，造成了「墳墓的悲劇，」延長至四十年之久。他的一切設計，都是大規模的，主要的建築均有三層樓　樣高，還有四十尊青銅的浮雕像和大理石的塑像。</p>
<p>據說，教皇會將聖彼得堂的會議廳拆毀了以便容納這個巨大的建築　。然而事情的　行，却並不順利。教皇的領袖建築師勃　曼底（），却要將他自己的外甥拉斐爾（）來替代米開蘭基羅，因此就向教皇進護，與這　佛羅棱　人米開蘭基羅以不利。米開蘭基羅的尊嚴和驕傲，正不下於教皇，於是在一怒之下，就逃回了佛羅棱　。下列的信是他寫給教皇的另一個建築師朱理亞諾（）的，對於教皇要他回去完成綁個墳墓的召喚，作了一個答覆。</p>
<p>「…牠將是　世無比的工程…」</p>
<p>本文　朱理亞諾大名家，教皇的建築</p>
<p>朱理亞諾，我從你的來信上，知道教皇為了我的離開在發怒，　　意議我自由用錢，來完成我們所約定的工程；也知道我可以回來，不必怕什麽。</p>
<p>關於我離開的事情，我可以將下面的事實告訴你；在復活節前的神聖禮拜六日，他在菓子上和一個珠寶商人　掌禮官談話，我聽見他說，他不願意再費一文　在石頭上，這話很使我吃驚。然而在我走開之前，我還是向他要求一些錢，以便繼續工作。他回答我，呌我到禮拜一再去：我在禮拜一、二、禮拜三、禮拜四，一連去了四天—他都見了我。最後，在禮拜五的早上，我就被請出來了，那就是說，被逐出來了！那個請我出來的人說，他認得我是誰，但這是他的命令。因此，在禮拜六我聽見了那些話，在以後數天之內受到了這些待　，我喪失了所有的希望。不過單單這件事，還不是我離開的全部原因。另外還有一個原因，但是我不願意在這裏寫出；這就夠使我想到，如果我還留在羅馬，我自己的墳墓也許要比教皇的墳墓先準備好。這就是我突然離開的原因。</p>
<p>現在你代表教皇寫信給我，當然你也會將這封信讀教皇聽。請你給教皇陛下知道……如果他的　要他的墳墓完工，最好他不要再激怒我，來問我的工作做到什麽地步，我總遵照約言，五年之內，在他的揀定的墓地上，就是聖彼得堂內，將這工程與以完成，而且一定如我所答應的那樣，使牠成為美麗的工程：因為我確信，如果這工程完成了，牠將是曠世無比的工程。</p>
<p>假使教皇陛下要繼續進行，請他將所說定的錢，交給此地佛羅棱　的一個人保管，此人的姓名我就會告訴你。……關於前面說到的錢和工程，我願意聽從陛下的任何指導，我也可以在佛羅棱薩供給他所要求的任何保證。最好事情　　　該辦的辦，我可以給他完全的保管，甚至這保證是整個的佛羅棱薩也不妨。不過另外還有一件事情我要　提一提，那所說的工程，也許在羅馬幹起來，不會成功，而在此地却可以成功，因為此地有誓言　利，　是羅馬所沒有的。……我請你早些給我一個回信。此外並無他言。</p>
<p>你的米開蘭基羅</p>
<p>雕刻家，在　羅棱薩</p>
<p>一五〇六年五月二日</p>
<p>後果　教皇發出了三次詔書，又以對佛羅棱薩共和國開戰相威脅，才使米　蘭基羅回到羅馬來。然而他一回來，却不許再去從事墳墓的工作。在一些瑣碎的工作之後，他奉命去裝飾西斯丁（）教堂的天花板。四年以來，他實際上成了囚犯，英勇地幹着那艱巨的勞作，在高高的　　傷，朝天躺着，於「人類的擾壞」中，盡出宇宙的創造和人的墮落。</p>
<p>一年之後，朱理第二去世。他的不足取的嗣子們和繼任的教皇們，對米開蘭基羅也是橫加干涉，逼得他將墳墓的計劃改變了五次。四十年努力履行契約的惟一結果，就只有摩西（）的英邁的雕像；克拉文曾說過，在這件作品裏面，有着「四十年來破產縮　的憤怒，在這憤怒裏面，這位藝術家的眼光，和事實的　界　突着，調和着。」最後，契約的本身被教皇保羅第三（）所毀掉，他命令開蘭基羅在西斯丁教堂的牆壁上，繪畫「最後的審判」—許多批評家，都經這畫為「人類破天荒以來隻手完成的最大工程。」</p>
<h3 id="c98">讀書與修養 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 承福</p>
<p>我們知道讀書不但可以增長知識，並且可以涵養德性。修養身心和做事，本來要從實際上磨練出來的，並非要靠讀書，但是書本上所見的　言往行，至少可以給我們很好的刺激，啟發，和印證，這種幫助實在是有益的，而且也是不可少的。</p>
<p>現代一般青年所應該特別注意的是：</p>
<p>（一）我們生在這混濁的社會中，外界的誘惑，如此厲害，我們怎樣才能保持我們不致墮落呢</p>
<p>（二）人生在世總不免有憂患痛苦的時候，這種境遇輪到頭上，我們怎樣才能得到精神上的安慰，不致　喪？</p>
<p>（三）我們要完成一種事業貨學問，中間一定要經過許多曲折困難。我們怎樣才能便得神志清明，精力繼續呢？</p>
<p>這三項我認為是修養最要關頭。這種修養陰要靠實際磨練外，假使平日沒有一點預備功夫，那麼事到臨頭，又從那裏　用起呢？平日預備工夫不外二種：一是良師益友的提　督責，二是前言往行的　　侵　。良師益友多可　而不可求，前言往行存在書本上商情拾便是。讀書的　修養上最大功用最大利益　在這裏。</p>
<p>修養的最好資料，就是讀名人傳記和信札。讀名人傳記的時候，不必要做歷史讀，可以專把牠當做修養書讀，看他們怎樣的做人，怎樣的做事，怎樣的從事學問，設　假使我處在他的地位，我便怎樣。碰着困難事情，我便怎樣？我們常用這種功夫，不但可以磨練德行，並且還可以　發才智，先輩論讀史益處，大抵最注重這點。</p>
<p>名人信札，最好讀他和　友平時的論事論學，讀之最可益人神智。假使我們能集中專取信札一門去讀，極有益　有趣</p>
<p>上面所舉的讀法，都拿幫助身心和做事做目的。孔子說：一古之學者為已，讀這類書專以自己直接能得益處為主，把自己這個人訓練好了，那才堅有益於社會。</p>

<p>— JamesHliton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十二）</p>
<p>「不　我的　得你—正像現在的你一樣。這就是重要的一點。在我的心目之中，你是永遠不會長大的。永遠不會的。例如，有人對我談到我們那位受人尊敬的校董會會長，我就會對自己想着，啊，對了，一個興高采烈的小小子，頭髮一根一根地直　　—絕對弄不懂　名詞和動形容詞有什麽分別。」（高聲大笑）唔，唔，我一定不可以再多說—　哼，說上一夜，請你們有時想著我，我是一定會想著你們的。Hsec　olim　meminisse　juvabit我還是不必　　。」許多大笑，喊叫，與延長的歡呼。</p>
<p>一九一三年八月。吉普斯到威斯巴登（Wiesaden）去治病，住在一個德國教師斯坦菲（Staefel）的室裏，斯坦菲比他小三十歲，可是兩個人相處得非常好。九月裏，學期開始時，吉普斯回來，住在威葛特夫人的屋子裏。他覺得在休假之後，強健了許多，有用了許多，差不多有些懊悔他的辭職。不過他要做的事情還是不少，他請所有的　　生來喝茶。他注意勃洛克菲爾德運動塲上所有重要的比賽。每學期一次，他和校長同吃飯，也一次和教師同吃飯。他負起了新「勃洛克菲爾德一覽」的準備於編　工作。他接受「老孩子俱　部」的會長之職，常　倫敦去吃飯。他偶然也為勃洛克菲爾德的定期雜誌寫寫文章，裏面充滿了笑話與拉丁文成語。他　天早上閱讀「太　士」報—很澈底地閱讀着，他也開始閱讀偵探小說—自從歇洛克福爾摩斯初次出現震動一時以來，他一直就嗜好着。是時，他很忙，也很快樂。</p>
<p>一年之後，一九一四年，他又參加學期結束的宴會。這時有許多談到戰爭的說話—　爾斯得（Ulster）的內戰，奧大利與塞爾比亞之間的糾紛。斯坦菲明天就要動身回到德國去，對吉普斯說，他想巴爾幹事件　是不會有什麽結果的。（三十三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Respectful Admonition to Japan's "China Hands" and China's "Japan Hands" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>To navigate complex international relations, a nation must, in times of peace, cultivate experts in the affairs of other countries to serve as the brains trust and advisors for governmental authorities in deciding international policy; in reality, a nation's international policy is entrusted to their hands. For decades, Japan has diligently cultivated "China Hands." As for China's "Japan Hands," they are truly far behind Japan in comparison. The evolution of Sino-Japanese relations in the past has been significantly influenced, directly or indirectly, by these "Japan Hands" and "China Hands." In particular, among these Japanese "China Hands," there are, of course, many who are worthy of the title, possessing a deep understanding and insightful views on China's national conditions and popular sentiment, along with fervent sympathy and the magnanimity of great statesmen embodying "bright breeze and clear moon" and "treating all people as their own."</p>
<p>However, the gradual deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations in the past decade or so, while primarily due to the instigation of discord by Britain and the United States, should also be attributed in considerable measure to both Japan's "China Hands" and China's "Japan Hands."</p>
<p>Looking back at past events, it is said that during the "China Incident," Chiang Kai-shek sought the opinion of the then-ambassador to Japan regarding Japan's national conditions. The embassy's conclusion was that Japan's national strength could not sustain a protracted war, and that as long as Britain and the United States intervened, Japan would surely retreat in the face of difficulties. Of course, the embassy cannot bear the responsibility for the incident, but the fact remains that "Japan Hands" of this kind, with a superficial understanding of Japan, served as consultants to the government, directly or indirectly leading the government's policy toward Japan down a wrong path.</p>
<p>In the past four or five years, there have been many in the Chongqing regime who, relying on a few Japanese books, or a few Japanese newspapers, or Anglo-American propaganda about Japan, have styled themselves as experts on Japan and participated in confidential matters. What good policies could possibly come out of this? Therefore, a year and a half ago, the Chongqing regime estimated that the ABC powers would be able to soften Japan, and estimated that Japan would never take action against Britain and the United States. These were all the results of Chongqing's insufficient understanding and erroneous assessment of Japan.</p>
<p>We cannot say that the same situation absolutely does not exist in Tokyo or Nanjing.</p>
<p>We hope that China and Japan will not only cooperate at present but also forever, so we offer the following suggestions to the governments in Tokyo and Nanjing, and to all those who aspire to study the national conditions of both countries and become true "China Hands" in Japan and true "Japan Hands" in China:</p>
<p>In the future, neither government should heavily rely on those who have only a superficial understanding of the other country's national conditions and popular sentiment. Relying on only a superficial understanding will be more harmful than not understanding at all, because those who do not understand at all will not make seemingly correct but actually wrong decisions that plunge both China and Japan into suffering, while those with a superficial understanding will be deeply mired in error without realizing it. Instead, they must cultivate and trust those with true knowledge and foresight, and those "true Hands" with the political magnanimity of "bright breeze and clear moon" and "treating all people as their own," as well as passionate commitment.</p>
<p>How can one become a "true Hand?"</p>
<p>The first principle is to have a correct understanding, belief, and determination to strive for the eternal cooperation of the two great nations of China and Japan. One must have ample love, enthusiasm, and sympathy for the other's nation and people, and have the sincerity and perseverance to sacrifice oneself for the sake of increasing understanding and cooperation between the two great nations and their peoples.</p>
<p>Secondly, one must conduct thorough and comprehensive investigations and research into the other's history, geography, national character, customs, habits, economy, politics, and culture. In particular, one must fully understand what is currently hated by the people and what is loved by the people, grasp the core of the path to eternal cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations, and find the fundamental principles and methods for eternal harmony between the two great nations. Only then can one be worthy of the title of "true Hand."</p>
<p>Furthermore, one should also recognize the other comprehensively and from an active perspective, and understand the other. One must recognize that both countries are progressing and keeping up with the times, and one must observe, recognize, and understand this progress from all aspects. It is especially necessary to be in contact with the majority of ordinary people. We must know that Japan in the Meiji Restoration and the Greater East Asia War has made progress with the passage of time. We should also know that the Chinese national movement, folk organizations, folk power, and current national consciousness since the Boxer Rebellion and the Triads have made great progress. If one still rigidly seeks the corpse of the Boxer Rebellion and the Triads, and tries to contact the outdated minority of bureaucrats and politicians, then the result will only be to get stuck in a dead end.</p>
<p>For the sake of promoting the cooperation of China and Japan and the two great nations, not only at present but also forever, we urgently need the efforts of all "Japan Hands" and "China Hands" to enhance the future happiness of both countries.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army Stationed in China Announces Comprehensive War Results for the Past Year; Interacting Forces of the Chongqing Army Decreased; Sophisticated Weapons Have Seen a Reduction <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The press department of the Japanese Army stationed in China yesterday (11th) announced a summary of the comprehensive war results of the Japanese Army stationed in China for the Greater East Asia War, Showa 17th year (Republic of China 31st year), as follows: 3,867,000 personnel of the Chongqing side engaged in combat; 260,805 bodies of Chongqing soldiers left behind; 124,408 prisoners captured; 109 Chongqing aircraft shot down or destroyed, of which 16 have not yet been confirmed; captured items include 28 field mountain guns, 7,599 boxes of ammunition, 535 heavy machine guns, 753,206 rounds of ammunition, 2,776 light machine guns, 513,571 rounds of ammunition, 810 mortars, 42,207 rounds of ammunition, 126,357 rifles, 109,630,116 rounds of ammunition, 22,201 pistols, 139,208 rounds of ammunition, 712,674 hand grenades. Japanese army losses include 8,400 killed in action.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The comprehensive war results on the China front for the past year, announced by the press department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army on the 11th, provide a detailed explanation of the decline in the combat power of the Chongqing army and serve as an excellent resource for estimating the combat power of the Chongqing army this year. According to this, the number of major operations by the Japanese army on the China front last year was approximately 50, and the number of engagements was approximately 2,500. Compared with the war results of the previous year, the interacting forces of the Chongqing army have decreased by 1,343,300, and the number of bodies left behind has also decreased by 84,000. However, the increase of 20,210 in the number of prisoners indicates that the Chongqing army has largely lost its will to fight. Furthermore, regarding the items captured, sophisticated weapons such as field mountain guns, heavy machine guns, and light machine guns have seen a reduction, while relatively simple weapons such as mortars, rifles, pistols, and hand grenades have seen a considerable increase. This proves that, due to the Japanese army cutting off the Chongqing side's transportation routes, foreign aid weapons have become extremely difficult to obtain, and they have had to rely solely on self-made weapons. Conversely, the Japanese army's losses have seen a sharp decrease compared to the previous year, which can be said to show that the Japanese army's morale is becoming increasingly high and is in stark contrast to the Chongqing army's loss of will to fight. The average daily interacting forces of the Chongqing army was 10,595, among whom 715 were killed in action and 341 were captured. Even excluding the loss of sick soldiers last year, the daily loss of troops reached as many as 1,056. The total number of bodies left behind and prisoners captured by the Chongqing army during this year is approximately 43 divisions, rifles approximately equivalent to 53 divisions, light machine guns approximately equivalent to 185 divisions, and heavy machine guns approximately equivalent to 11 divisions. Considering the Chongqing army's large losses in personnel and weapons, one should also know how distressed they are. The comprehensive war results for last year and the previous year are compared as follows: (1) Interacting forces decreased by 1,343,300; (1) Bodies left behind decreased by 84,000; (1) Prisoners increased by 20,210; (1) Captured items: field mountain guns decreased by 29, ammunition decreased by 6,850, heavy machine guns decreased by 435, ammunition decreased by 19,000, light machine guns decreased by 780, mortars increased by 260, rifles increased by 6,881, pistols increased by 8,858, hand grenades increased by 94,000.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Supreme National Defense Council Holds Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The Supreme National Defense Council held its fifth meeting yesterday (11th). In addition to ratifying the selection of personnel for the reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Committee and the establishment of the Enemy Property Management Committee, Huang Xianggu was specially appointed as a member of the National Economic Committee, and Hu Dunfu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhou Chaoran, and Shen Siliang were appointed as members of the New National Movement Promotion Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Minister Aoki Clarifies Policies on Various Issues Concerning China <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, in the first subcommittee of the House of Representatives' budget committee on the 10th, responded to questions raised by Diet members Takataro Sakuda, Michio Sakuma, and Yatatsugu Nakajima, and clarified Japan's policies on various issues concerning China. The main points are: (1) Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, it will be decided through consultations between specialized committees of both countries. The first step in the implementation method will be to start with extraterritoriality regarding taxation rights. The timeframe cannot yet be determined. The specialized committee will solicit opinions from the public, but the system of civilian participation is not yet under consideration. (2) Regarding the transfer of enemy property in China, from the perspective of completing the Greater East Asia War, there are also cases where it is more appropriate for us to handle it. It is planned to transfer it to the management of the National Government. (3) Regarding economic cooperation, it is natural to purchase Chinese goods and fully utilize the National Government's institutions for mutual cooperation. In particular, the food issue is of utmost importance to people's livelihoods, so this intention should be fully understood before proceeding. As for the production, distribution, and consumption of cotton, etc., which are closely related, the opinions of officials and civilians on the Chinese side should be respected in order to realize cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Tokyo Celebrates the Founding Day with Enthusiasm <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) The 11th is Japan's Founding Day. The Emperor specially held rituals for the Imperial Ancestors in the Imperial Palace, and the Imperial Household dispatched envoys to offer sacrifices at the Tsubaru Shrine, the sacred site of the founding of the nation.

<h3 id="e7">Minister Lin Returned to the Capital Yesterday and Gave a Speech to Reporters in Hankou <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) After Minister of Propaganda Lin arrived in Wuhan, he attended the mass demonstrations held by the provincial and municipal governments to support the war and destroy the British and Americans. He was also invited to give speeches to cadres of various organizations and Japanese residents in Wuhan. Minister Lin explained in detail the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and the responsibilities that the people should bear in wartime. This (11th) morning at 8:00 AM, he again flew to Ying'an County in Hubei Province to attend a mass meeting of the county's people and delivered a speech. He did not complete his public duties until 12:10 PM, and immediately boarded a plane at 12:25 PM to return to Nanjing. Provincial and municipal government officials and heads of various organizations all went to the airport to see him off.</p>
<p>Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) After Minister of Propaganda Lin arrived in Wuhan, he hosted a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Wuhua Hotel in the city yesterday (10th) at 5:00 PM. More than 30 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, telegraph agencies, as well as the German Huitong News Agency and the Italian Stefani Agency attended. A record of the various questions and answers is as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Minister Lin, what are your impressions of this visit to Wuhan?</p>
<p>A: This time I came to Wuhan and saw that there has been significant progress in all aspects. I attended the mass meeting in Wuchang yesterday and was very impressed. Especially today, I attended the mass meeting in Hankou, which had more than 60,000 people, the most seen since the Wuhan Incident. From this, it can be seen that China's future is bright and worthy of expectation. Wuhan is the cradle of the revolution, and the people's patriotic ideas are very strong. In the future, they will be able to advance more bravely in shouldering the responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia.</p>
<p>Q: What preparations will China make in terms of administrative measures for the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality in the future?</p>
<p>A: China is currently studying the improvement of the judicial system and strengthening police training, so that after the abolition of extraterritoriality, the safety of all friendly residents will be more reliably guaranteed.</p>
<p>Q: How will the National Government manage and dispose of enemy property in the future?</p>
<p>A: Regarding the issue of enemy property reception, the National Government has organized an Enemy Property Management Committee, with the Minister of Finance concurrently serving as the Chairman. A bureau or office may be established under it. The general structure is like this. As for the disposal of enemy property, it can be divided into two major departments: (1) In the industrial field, the factories received will be planned and utilized by the Ministry of Industry, and developed as much as possible within the scope of possibility, so as to increase production. (2) In the cultural field, the tools of Anglo-American cultural aggression in the past will be reorganized to promote Eastern culture and Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Q: How will the youth movement be promoted and developed in the future?</p>
<p>A: The promotion of the New National Movement and the work of the Youth League after the war has made the need for more intensive training even more apparent. Our original plan for promoting the youth movement, which was mainly based on students, now needs to be adapted to the wartime system. In addition to young students, there is also a need for unification for working youth. Therefore, in the near future, we will merge the two systems into one, that is, organize the Chinese Youth League, which will be further divided into youth and scout troops.</p>
<p>Q: What are the reasons for the recent reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Committee and how will it be improved in the future?</p>
<p>A: The reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Committee is the same as the reorganization of the provincial and municipal government agencies in various places. The reason is entirely to implement the wartime system and strengthen its administrative agencies. Furthermore, because Chairman Wang Yitang had long intended to resign, he submitted a request to resign this time, and his intention was very firm. Therefore, the National Government appointed Mr. Zhu Shen to succeed him as the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Q: What are the missions of the New National Movement, the Kuomintang, and the East Asia League?</p>
<p>A: On the surface, the New National Movement, the Kuomintang, and the East Asia League are several organizations, each with its own nature. This is actually a misunderstanding. Let me explain it simply. First of all, the New National Movement and the East Asia League are like the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Asia Development League, one is internal and the other is external, with different goals but the same substance. Furthermore, regarding the issue of the party, the general public still views the party as an administrative agency as it was during Chiang Kai-shek's era, and some people still think so now. It must be known that the Kuomintang leads the people, so that every party member is in the inner layer of the people, doing the work of leading the people, not using the party headquarters to interfere in administration. Therefore, the party members led by Chairman Wang must go deep among the people, use the party's doctrine as the central idea, create a common belief, and the nation can develop first, and the New National Movement can also develop. At the same time, in addition to the party, there are other parties and non-partisan people. In order to enable them to understand the spirit of the East Asia League and receive the training of the New National Movement, the Kuomintang has a major responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Ministry of Social Welfare Organized and Established <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Since the Supreme National Defense Council resolved to establish the Ministry of Social Welfare, the ministry has been organized and established in accordance with the organizational law. Now, in order to manage social welfare, promote charity, and provide political guidance to the people, the ministry has specially established the People's Political Guidance Department, Public Welfare Department, Disaster Relief Bureau, Social Simple Insurance Bureau, General Affairs Department, Physical Fitness Department, Labor Department, and Vocational Department. When necessary in terms of affairs, with the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, it may increase, merge, or abolish its subordinate departments, bureaus, divisions, member associations, and other agencies. As for personnel selection, it is currently under careful consideration and will be finalized within days.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The New National Movement Promotion Committee recently determined that the organization and training of youth and children in various places, which is divided into two systems, the Chinese Youth League and the Chinese Boy Scouts, is inappropriate. In order to adapt to the unified command of youth and children nationwide after the National Government's participation in the war, it was decided on February 9th to merge the two systems of the Chinese Youth League and the Chinese Boy Scouts into one, renamed the Chinese Youth and Children's League, which is divided into youth teams and children's teams. Schools with only youth teams or only children's teams still establish the Chinese Youth and Children's League's school branch. The previously promulgated General Regulations of the Youth League and the General Regulations of the Boy Scouts are being merged and revised into the General Regulations of the Chinese Youth and Children's League, which will be promulgated soon.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) According to authoritative sources in London political circles, the so-called Stabilization Fund measures taken by Britain and the United States towards Chongqing in the past now exist only in name.

<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency) According to reports from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities recently decided to limit the number of rickshaw pullers and sedan chair carriers in the city in March, and to compulsorily recruit the remaining sedan chair carriers, about 10,000, into the army, or send them to work in mines and agriculture. In addition, they will also compulsorily transfer traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and servants in hotels and inns to other occupations. It is said that this compulsory recruitment method will be gradually implemented in various places under the rule of the Chongqing side.</p>

<p>Zhao Nan Island, 11th (Central News Agency) As Singapore's fall approaches its first anniversary, the head of the military administration of Zhao Nan Island met with a group of reporters on the eve of the anniversary and made a statement on the future policies of the military administration of Malaya and Sumatra, as follows: The residents here are living happily under our military administration, and the local situation is excellent. Various administrative measures have been extended to remote villages, and the people's main livelihoods have gradually become stable. Residents are actively working hard to increase food production. In the future, the military administration will not only ensure that residents fully understand the purpose of the holy war, but will also ensure the minimum necessary living necessities to seek stability in the lives of residents. In order to promote the exchange of materials and develop the region's light industry, it is planned to import necessary materials from Japan and seek various necessary measures. Therefore, it is believed that Malaya's people's livelihood and public security can be further improved.</p>

<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines has decided to announce a military sentence reduction order on the 11th, the Japanese Empire Day, to reduce or commute the sentences of those convicted by Japanese military tribunals. The authorities issued a statement on the 10th, stating that the Japanese commander, with deep benevolence and leniency, has reduced or commuted military sentences because many rebellious elements in the Philippines have been sentenced by military tribunals in the past year. According to the amnesty order, those sentenced to death will be commuted to 15 years of imprisonment, long-term imprisonment will be commuted to 10 years of imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment will be reduced by two-thirds. Moreover, elderly offenders, those deemed pitiful, and those willing to reform will be released. This sentence reduction order is promulgated on the first anniversary of the fall of the Philippines, which further demonstrates the significance of the Greater East Asia War. It is truly worthy of celebration. Those who are pardoned will surely be deeply grateful for the warmth of the Japanese army. We sincerely hope that the general public will deeply understand the intention of the Japanese commander, recognize the current new situation, and strive to build a new Philippines.</p>

<p>Headquarters of the Führer, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to today's announcement by the German military, fierce battles continue on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The German defensive battles have been very effective. The German forces in the Caucasus are making progress in their counter-offensive against the newly landed Soviet forces southwest of Novorossiysk. Soviet attacks upstream of the Donets River have been repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - German authorities explained the situation on the Eastern Front on the 10th, saying that the most intense fighting is currently taking place in the central region of the Donets Basin. The Soviet offensive in that area is even larger in scale than last winter's counter-offensive. The German forces are engaging the Soviet forces along the front line, preventing their advance, and using mobility to penetrate deep into the Soviet positions, achieving great results. Soviet reinforcements landed northwest of Novorossiysk on the 9th and are already engaged in fierce fighting with the German forces in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Heavy snow continues to fall in the area between the Donets Basin and the Kursk-Orel line, making it difficult to detect the movements of enemy forces. The German side does not have a straight defensive line in that area, only uneven, jagged strongholds. The Soviet army uses the heavy snow to occasionally break into the German front lines, but the German positions have not moved as a result. Often, just as the enemy is preparing to encircle a certain place, the German forces launch a sudden counter-offensive and inflict heavy damage. A column of Soviet mechanized units several kilometers long was trapped in the heavy snow between the Donets and Oskol rivers. It was completely defeated by a sudden German attack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The situation on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has generally not changed. However, the pressure exerted by the enemy on Kharkov has increased. The German army is using flexible tactics to prevent the Soviet army from encircling the city. When the German front lines are occasionally breached, they carry out counter-offensives. They once advanced to Belgorod and are still engaged in fierce fighting there. The area around Izium and Slavyansk is relatively quiet. The German forces have counter-attacked and recaptured several villages to prevent the enemy from advancing from north to south. However, the Soviet army has concentrated heavy troops in that area, and fierce battles are expected to break out soon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military figures in Berlin recently declared that the situation on the Eastern Front is gradually improving, and the German resistance has been strengthened, especially on the southern sector. Therefore, the Soviet army made no progress yesterday. The German army has launched a counter-offensive along the entire front, with strong forces. Although the Soviet army broke through our main front line, they were immediately repelled by the defending forces. The German defensive battles in the areas northwest of the lower Don River and the Donets Bay have been most effective. The Soviet army has launched several attacks, suffering heavy losses in manpower and materials. The German defense of Novorossiysk and the Kupiansk area is also proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>German Heavy Artillery Bombards Leningrad</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - German artillery heavily bombarded military facilities in Leningrad yesterday, hitting ammunition factories, shipyards, warehouses, etc. A telegraph office and a Baltic shipyard caught fire. Several enemy artillery positions were also destroyed. Soviet aircraft took off to try to prevent the German forces from continuing to fire, but were driven back by anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 9th that German heavy artillery units had heavily bombarded Leningrad's military facilities and harbor area, achieving great results. It is now learned that as a result of the bombardment, in addition to the destruction of various ammunition factories, warehouses, and transportation facilities, electrical wire factories and shipyards also caught fire. Furthermore, the Soviet artillery positions were silenced by the German attack. Soviet air force dispatched a large number of aircraft to prevent the artillery from continuing their operations but were driven back by anti-aircraft artillery units and infantry units.</p>
<p>Fate of German Soldiers Encircled in Stalingrad</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Authoritative authorities here revealed today that there are currently no official reports regarding the fate and whereabouts of every soldier fighting in Stalingrad. Regarding this matter, German newspapers reported that the army and air force in each military district have been ordered to investigate and collect information about the whereabouts of the soldiers besieged in Stalingrad. The information obtained from the wounded soldiers who withdrew from Stalingrad is currently being reviewed, which will take some time. Therefore, no information can currently be released about the fate of each soldier.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to the latest news from both the Axis and Allied sides, the situation in North Africa remains stalled. The fighting in Tunisia is limited to reconnaissance activities and mutual artillery bombardment. According to a Rome communique, reconnaissance units are very active at the border between Tunisia and Tripolitania. However, according to London news, General Rommel has completed the withdrawal of his troops from Tripolitania into Tunisia and has concentrated German and Italian forces under his command. The front lines are currently quiet, but both sides' air forces are very active. Anglo-American squadrons attacked Kairouan, causing many civilian casualties. Later, they bombed Calabria and Trapani, suffering minor damage. Several civilians were killed or wounded. Four enemy aircraft were shot down over Trapani. In Algiers, German aircraft bombed the port of Bona, hitting a merchant ship, and the port facilities were also bombed. British aircraft again attacked the port of Palermo in Sicily and Axis bases in Crete today, including the port of Heraklion. In the past forty-eight hours, the Anglo-Americans lost forty-four aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - This week, enemy forces in North Africa have become active again. The British Eighth Army first engaged in reconnaissance with motorcycle units on February 7, but were defeated as soon as they crossed the Tunisian-Libyan border. The next day, a larger number of British troops attacked again and were also repelled. The German army launched a counter-offensive and drove the British back to Tripoli. General Montgomery has not yet deployed his entire force. It is believed that he will launch a major offensive after receiving a large number of reinforcements, or he may launch an offensive simultaneously with the British First Army in western Tunisia, it is unknown. American forces in the area north of Gafsa and Mateur are still continuing to concentrate. American forces in the area of Kasserine and Sbeitla are also engaged in similar activities. On February 9, the American forces in that area attempted to recapture the Faïd Pass but failed. Whether this action is a prelude to a major offensive by the American Fifth Army remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Responsible sources say that a fierce air battle occurred over Kairouan, Tunisia on Tuesday. As six German bombers were patrolling the German front lines, they suddenly encountered a large formation of British bombers and fighters, about fifty in number. The German aircraft disregarded everything and immediately charged at them. After a fierce battle lasting fifty minutes, fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down. All of the German aircraft safely returned to base afterward. It is also reported that from the time the enemy invaded French North Africa on November 6, 1942, until February 9 of this year, the Anglo-American air forces have lost 703 aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e22">President Wang Answers Questions from Japanese Reporters on the Government's Policies After Entering the War <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Asahi Shimbun special correspondent Matsudaira, Nanjing dispatch) - I, the reporter, with the introduction of the News Department, along with a group of Osaka Army reporters, went to President Wang's residence and had the opportunity to pay our respects to him. President Wang, in the midst of his busy political affairs, personally received us and spoke freely about the government's policies after entering the war, including increasing production and building the army. The following is the question and answer session between the reporter and President Wang:</p>
<p>Q: What are the fundamental policies of the government after entering the war?</p>
<p>A: The most important thing is to clearly identify who are the comrades of East Asia and who are the traitors of East Asia. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the government still hoped that the Chongqing side would take this opportunity to reflect and return to the camp of peaceful China. However, they brazenly risked infamy and followed the path of traitors of East Asia. Their old habits remained unchanged, and they continued to fight alongside Britain and the United States, or concluded treaties of non-separate peace, which greatly disappointed us. But we still harbored appeasement and, for the past year, have been vigorously urging the Chongqing side to reflect. However, they were stubborn and unrepentant, and betrayed this good intention, and our efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>In order to clearly demonstrate our position and unite East Asian comrades, the government decided to enter the war. Although our strength is small, we are willing to do our utmost to stand on the side of participating in the war. The aim of future governance is to achieve the great unity of the Chinese people, to complete the Greater East Asia War, and to clearly recognize that this is the way to save China. Guide the people to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. The above is the fundamental policy of the government. I believe that there is no other way to liberate China. Fortunately, the Government of the Japanese Empire has accepted our sincerity and provided various assistance, enabling us to automatically rise up and participate in the war.</p>
<p>The Government of the Japanese Empire, in order to make China a modern nation, is willing to provide even more powerful assistance by returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. The government expresses its deep gratitude for this. Promoting the New Movement is one of the fundamental policies, so that we can first guide the people spiritually.</p>
<p>Q: How will the increase in production and the reform of political institutions be implemented?</p>
<p>A: This matter stems from the above fundamental policy and is as important as strengthening public security. Developing important resources and assisting the Greater East Asia War is a matter of utmost urgency. It is not only required by the current situation, but also can establish East Asia's self-sufficient economy and solve the common economic problems of China and Japan. From this point of view, it should be highly valued. At the third National Defense Conference this morning, we prepared to discuss specific economic policies. However, because they are still under discussion, I cannot describe them in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding the reform of political institutions, as announced last time, we will first strengthen the centralization of central political institutions, and then strengthen the centralization of local political institutions, changing the provincial committee system to the provincial governor system.</p>
<p>Q: What are the goals for building the army after entering the war?</p>
<p>A: To revive China and defend East Asia are the fundamental policies for building the army. Regarding its specific points, I will explain a few points:</p>
<p>First, the current quality of the government's army. Eight or nine out of ten of the government's troops were drawn from the Chongqing army or Chongqing guerrilla forces. Therefore, because of past relationships, the environment of these troops is different. Future army building will focus on how to reorganize and organize these troops, striving to implement elite soldierism. Last year, we transferred officers and soldiers from all over the country to the Central Army Officers Training Corps to instill the "meaning of the nation" and build the "meaning of the Greater East Asia Construction". In just one month, all officers and soldiers will be trained. This year, we will further reorganize the army and train it. It would be a great mistake to think that the meaning of reorganization is eliminationism. We will never disappoint anyone who comes to join the Peace Army, not even a single soldier. Otherwise, the Chongqing army, which hopes to participate in the peace movement, will be held back. The so-called reorganization is implemented according to three standards. We select the best soldiers among the soldiers, reorganize them, and organize them into regular troops, giving them preferential treatment. The second group is given a lighter task and incorporated into the security team. Third, those who have no soldier qualities are guaranteed their livelihood so that they can live a peaceful civilian life. In the short term, we will reorganize the army according to these three standards. Although we cannot obtain a large number of elite soldiers for the time being, we believe that we will be able to obtain a portion of elite soldiers in the future. For the time being, we must first devote ourselves to training elite soldiers.</p>
<p>The second goal before achieving this ideal is that at least the government's army must secure the peaceful areas in order to reduce the burden on the rear of the Japanese army. Third, when the Peace Army can completely secure the peaceful areas, the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing side may be willing to return. This is the third goal.</p>
<p>The above are all interrelated issues and cannot be considered separately. For example, increasing production, developing resources, and strengthening economic strength will enable the army to be built smoothly. From this example, we can see that the promotion of politics, military affairs, and economy follows this path completely. Do not misunderstand this point.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - British Prime Minister Churchill declared in the House of Commons today that the theme of the Casablanca Conference was to discuss military issues. The war plan discussed by me and Roosevelt was to fight the enemy simultaneously on land, sea, and air as much as time and material resources allowed. The greatest threat we currently face is from submarines. Churchill continued that I have repeatedly provided Roosevelt with solemn assurances that Britain will do its utmost to conduct operations against Japan and is willing to establish a special treaty with the United States on this matter, but Roosevelt has expressed satisfaction with this verbal assurance. The Allied countries should do their utmost to provide assistance to the Soviet Union in the future, but I still regret that Stalin was unable to attend the Casablanca Conference.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from Washington, German long-range guns across the Strait of Dover suddenly began firing on the southern coast of England at the same time at noon on the 10th. The bombardment was quite fierce. It seemed that there were six giant cannons participating in the bombardment, firing more than a hundred shells. This was one of the most intense bombardments since the start of the war. For example, department stores and restaurants in a certain city were hit, and the casualties were quite high because it was lunchtime.

<p>Helsinki, Finland, 10th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Finnish General Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating that in the past twenty-four hours, our army engaged in fierce battles with enemy forces in certain areas of eastern Karelia, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. There were only reconnaissance activities on other lines. The well-known American commentator Walter Lippmann published a commentary advocating that Finland should conclude a separate peace with the Soviet Union for its own needs. Finnish newspapers have all written articles to refute it. One major newspaper stated that Finland will fight as long as it holds weapons. We Finns would rather die in battle than submit to the Communist Party. We will never allow our country to be reduced to a Soviet province.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of excessively high compensation for lower-level executives of control associations, corporations, and national policy associations, Mr. Suehiro Nishio, at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 5th, requested that, in the current situation, "it is not the time to discuss the balance of compensation from a financial perspective." It is a noteworthy viewpoint that, under the harsh wartime system, the thoughts of all citizens should be focused on striving for victory. The process of advancing towards victory relies on the increasing tension in the lives of the people. In this era, we should unreservedly realize that "capable people should not consider compensation," which is what all citizens should strive to practice. To strive for victory, all citizens should be frank and selfless, and serve the public with integrity.</p>
<p>Of course, the current urgent task is to fully understand the importance of the current situation, so as to guide the people to practice the above-mentioned way of life, and promote the proper integration of their strengths.</p>
<p>At the House of Representatives' Special Wartime Administrative Law Bill Committee, Prime Minister Tojo thanked the parliament for its trust, explained his position of bearing heavy responsibility, and explained the difference from Western-style dictatorship. He and President Suzuki of the Planning Board solemnly emphasized the purpose of utilizing the current forms in industrial management, which is of course necessary for the expansion of current military strength. As President Suzuki supplemented: "Due to the urgency of the war and other circumstances, when the environment changes, it cannot but be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>At the budget general meeting, Mr. Tadataka Ikezaki's opinion of "grasping the idea of unifying China in thought" is noteworthy. Mr. Ikezaki said: "The lack of grasping this idea is one of the reasons for the delay in resolving the China Incident." Not to mention the past, even considering the future of the Greater East Asia construction, it cannot be ignored. We advocate the spirit of Hakkō ichiu for the ideal of Greater East Asia construction. This ideal of Hakkō ichiu is by no means like the propaganda of the United Kingdom and the United States, but an absolute ideal that is inseparable from our reality. After fully grasping the thought of China, and restoring it to its original Oriental spirit, and feeling empathy for this great ideal, then can we jointly move towards the construction of East Asia.</p>
<p>Mr. Ikezaki does not agree with the method of preserving the international nature of Shanghai, not because the problem is too small to pay attention to. Mr. Ikezaki's opinion is whether or not the concession should be returned with conditions. As a result of exchanging opinions with Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the interpretation of the so-called internationality is that the inner meaning of this internationality should completely eliminate the remnants of British and American aggression in East Asia, and be built by us.

<h3 id="e39">Gandhi Starts Fasting - Nationwide Strike for One Day <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - Mahatma Gandhi began fasting yesterday morning. It will continue for a certain period of time, which will be determined by the actions of the Indian government. Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, stating that he did not hope to fast to death, but only to allow the "judgment of God" to continue to exist. If God wills, this fast can be ended by the Indian government providing the necessary relief. Gandhi's fast is a protest against the Indian National Congress Party not being responsible for the Indian riots and his continued detention by the British as inappropriate. After the news of Gandhi's fast spread, there was a one-day strike in India. At the same time, the Indian government is unwilling to study the Congress's "demand to expel India," and Gandhi is not responsible. Gandhi will not eat unless he is unconditionally released.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 10th (Havas News Agency) - After Indian Mahatma Gandhi started fasting today, all city markets went on strike to express sympathy, but no unexpected incidents occurred. Gandhi is confined in the Aga Khan Palace, and the authorities have dispatched additional police protection. In addition, according to the British authorities, Gandhi will be allowed to meet with foreigners and freely choose doctors for treatment. Gandhi's party members are extremely worried about his fasting, as he is old and ill. However, Gandhi himself said, "I do not want to die, and I hope I can survive so that I can continue to fight."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since India launched another anti-British movement last August demanding independence, the elder Gandhi of the National Congress Party was arrested by British officials. After half a year of silence, he suddenly demanded unconditional release from the authorities on the 10th and began fasting. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the news of Gandhi's fast has spread throughout India, and all Indian people are deeply moved. However, because Gandhi is 75 years old, they are quite worried about his health. It is said that when Gandhi started fasting, he said that he had considered his physical strength and would only drink thin fruit juice.</p>

<p>Perhaps some people think, "It is already clear that Britain is not good to China. Isn't the United States better?" It is true that the United States has established schools and hospitals in China, which seems to be good to us on the surface, but it is actually a conspiracy of cultural aggression. Not to mention anything else, the United States has recently made two statements. The first sentence is "Blood is thicker than water. Britain and the United States are of the same blood. Although there is the Atlantic Ocean between them, the blood is fused." This is the so-called "blood is thicker than water." They themselves are like this, but for East Asia, they will never allow China and Japan to be together. China and Japan are also of the same blood. If their blood is the same, they will cooperate. Why can't we, China and Japan, who have the same writing system and the same race, get along well? Everyone, think about it, what is the reason for this? The second sentence is "Strength is more important than land." That is to say, strength is more important than land. This is what Roosevelt said to Chiang Kai-shek. Between the lines, he hopes that as long as strength is preserved, the loss of land does not matter. Last time, the "Third War Zone" in Zhejiang claimed to have 200,000 troops, but they were vulnerable to a single blow. They lost the land, lost the people, and fled. Some people said that Gu Zhutong should be shot because he was derelict in his duty. However, Chiang Kai-shek said that this was his policy, to maintain strength, and he was willing to give up land. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Chongqing has been defeated in every battle, without exception. They lost the land, lost their compatriots, and saw these as not Chinese land, and everyone as not Chinese compatriots. This is also this policy. Fellow compatriots, aren't you all compatriots abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek? This is so heartbreaking. Therefore, the cunning of Britain and the United States is the same. Britain and the United States are all schemers who harbor the ambition to invade China. Following Britain and the United States will only lead to national extinction. To save the country, we must live and die together with our friendly neighbor Japan and defend East Asia. If East Asia can be defended, China can be saved. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been three years. During this period, it has gone through countless hardships. Naturally, many things have not been done. However, during this period, we have already seen progress bit by bit. The year before last, after the National Government returned to the capital, it signed the Basic Relations Treaty with our friendly neighbor Japan. Not to mention anything else, just take Article 7, which concerns the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. At that time, some people inevitably thought that this was an empty promise. But now, it has progressed from the agreement in the articles to the stage of realization. What was suspected three years ago has now been proven to be true. Some people say that after Japan returns the concessions, doesn't Britain and the United States also sing loudly about returning the concessions to Chongqing? I will not talk about whether Britain and the United States are sincere for the time being. Just looking at the facts, where are the British and American concessions? Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hankou's concessions, is there any place in the hands of Britain and the United States? What are they going to return? Some people say that it is best to return Hong Kong, but Hong Kong has been snatched from under the hooves of Britain and the United States by Japan. What are they going to return? It is better to generously say that they will also return Nanyang than to return other people's land. Fortunately, it is not their own East Asia. Britain and the United States are using Chongqing as a tool to... to plunder China's territory and sacrifice the Chinese people, single-mindedly seeking benefits for themselves. Japan is strengthening the National Government's strength with a warm heart, returning concessions, abolishing extraterritorial rights, and sincerely returning all... properties and factories in China to us. These are all facts, and they are all... obtained through many difficulties and hardships, and through the sincere cooperation of the two countries. Finally, there are still many compatriots who say, "I already understand that I should participate in the war, but how do I participate in the war?" It is useless to have the will but not the ability. Fellow compatriots, do not think like this. We have strength. Everyone must know that modern warfare is total warfare. In total warfare, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. The front defends East Asia and resists the enemy in the midst of gunfire, while the rear works diligently day and night, engaging in labor, increasing production, and ensuring security. They are all using their strength to contribute to the war and support the victory of the war. As long as we are determined and willing to work hard, we can exert our strength to assist Japan in politics, economics, and even culture. We have material resources, we have manpower, and we have the conscience of 40,000 compatriots who have not died, the conscience to revive China and defend East Asia. We have strength. We should not boast or give up on ourselves. A grain of rice on the ground, our hands and feet, and the blood in our hearts are all the strength to participate in the war. I hope that all compatriots will contribute their blood, their conscience, and their strength to the country, to East Asia. Under the guidance of our highest leader, we will vigorously implement the New National Movement, participate in the war with all our strength, and... rise up to revive China and defend East Asia, this great mission.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Production and Sales of Salt in Fujian - Nanping Correspondence - Transshipped from Macau - Difficult Transportation and Poor Sales <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Salt is a daily necessity, second in importance only to grain, and is an important raw material for industry, which can influence the development of industry. Therefore, although its quantity is large and its acquisition is easy, its importance cannot be ignored. The largest source of salt in our country is sea salt. Fujian was originally a salt-producing area. Before the war, the salt production was not only sufficient for self-sufficiency, but a portion of its tax salt could also be transported and sold to the Chaoshan area. After the outbreak of the war, it further increased the burden on neighboring provinces. Therefore, the salt affairs of Fujian are not only related to the province, but also to Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, becoming an important economic issue.</p>
<p>In Fujian Province, there were 13 salt fields at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and there are now 10 salt fields, namely the Qianxia salt field in Putian County, the Putian salt field, the Shanyao salt field in Hui'an County, the Xunshan salt field in Jinjiang County, the Lianhe salt field in Tong'an County, the Zhaopu salt field in Dongshan County, the Fuqing salt field in Fuqing County, as well as the Nanjin salt field, Wenjiang salt field, and Zhaopu salt field established in recent years. Among these 10 salt fields, we can clearly see that the production areas are all located in the southern part of Fujian Province, which is due to the climate being more conducive to salt drying. According to the statistics of the past year, all the salt fields have a total of 5,491 salt households and 229,924 salt drying sites. The number of people engaged in salt drying is about 50,000, and the number of people involved in transporting salt is more than 200,000. According to official statistics, the highest salt production in the province was more than 3 million piculs in 1929, and the statistics for the three years after the War of Resistance Against Japan were 1.27 million piculs in 1937, 2.04 million piculs in 1938, and 2.31 million piculs in 1939. The production in 1941 fell to 1.4 million piculs. These figures seem to indicate a decrease in salt production. However, salt is a daily necessity. If there is not enough salt, it will inevitably cause turmoil. And we only see the decline in salt production, but we have not heard of the phenomenon of insufficient salt. Therefore, there are two true explanations for the decline in salt production:</p>
<p>First, due to inconvenient transportation and the inability of the Salt Affairs Bureau to provide sufficient salt, the use of private salt has expanded daily. As it stands, the price of official salt is 2.4 yuan per catty, while private salt is more than 8 yuan. The increased price of private salt due to demand has further increased the profits of salt smugglers. Therefore, in official reports, we see a decrease in salt production. Since the implementation of salt distribution based on population, the former quota system in the province has been abolished. The salt in the province is transported by various land and water transportation routes in the province, and sold by the county salt affairs offices to the salt shops in various townships and towns, and then sold to the people according to the population. However, due to transportation difficulties, the price in southern Fujian is different from that in northern Fujian. Although the allocation is the same on the surface, the actual difference is very large. Because half a catty of salt per person can be replaced by soy sauce and shrimp paste in cities, it is not difficult. However, in rural areas, it relies solely on this half a catty of salt to maintain, and the amount of shortage must be considerable. The price of private salt is lower in the southern Fujian area, which is close to the salt fields. In northern Fujian, the price of salt is often more than 10 yuan. The people feel very difficult to maintain a non-bland diet. Currently, the provincial salt affairs authorities are aware of this and plan to increase the monthly salt sales to one catty per person on the Yong'an to Nanping line first. This is of course what the people hope for, and the people of the whole province hope that it can be spread to every corner of the province. Serious problems have arisen in domestic sales due to transportation. As for foreign sales, they are also often trapped in difficulties for the same reason. According to the statistics of 1941, more than 60,000 piculs of salt were sold abroad every month, supplying Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. There are three transportation routes, all of which are transported from Fujian Province to Jiangxi, and then transferred from Jiangxi to Hunan. The routes are from Yunxiao in southern Fujian via Guangdong to Jiangxi, from Changting in western Fujian to Ruijin in Jiangxi, and from Shaowu in northern Fujian to Guangze in Jiangxi. More than half of the route depends on land transportation. This situation not only increases the price of salt, but also reduces the amount of salt. After replacing automobile transportation with post transportation, although it is not subject to the restrictions of gasoline pressure cars, the time and effectiveness of transportation are more difficult. The production of salt has peak and off seasons, which makes the salt have a situation of not connecting the new with the old. These are all worth noting and studying. Due to environmental needs, the Fujian Provincial Salt Administration convened a production increase meeting in southern Fujian in September to discuss various issues related to increasing salt production. It is planned to increase the production to 6 million piculs next year, with more than half of it supplied to neighboring provinces. After the production increase meeting, a meeting was also held in Quanzhou to discuss issues such as transportation and smuggling prevention. The resolutions have been carried out in order. For the convenience of management and supervision, the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau and the Audit Office have been moved from Gongchuan in Yong'an to Fuzhou. These all indicate that the provincial salt affairs authorities have started to rectify, which is worth the attention of the people. Of course, we cannot deny that there are still places in today's salt administration that need to be improved urgently. The salt quality is impure, and the auditors should bear the full responsibility. In terms of cities and villages, the need for salt between the two is very different, and its allocation should also be noted by us. As for the reduction of supply to neighboring provinces due to traffic problems, it seems that the refining of salt crystals to reduce weight is also worth studying and paying attention to. Fujian is a salt-producing province, and the people will not have to worry about eating bland food. However, the panic caused by insufficient salt has been widespread in rural areas. This is really worthy of the attention of those who manage salt affairs. (Sent on December 20, 1942)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - London News, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons yesterday when asked to report on the situation in North Africa that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently working with the Intelligence Department to consider appropriate ways to inform the people of the political, economic, and social situation in North Africa. After the release of this information, the people can be given a clear understanding of the situation in North Africa.</p>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) - The French official news agency recently issued a message stating that the military and political situation in French North Africa has aroused serious concern in British and American public opinion circles. The United States representative to North Africa, Murphy, and the United Kingdom representative to North Africa, Macmillan, recently held talks, resulting in the appointment of Peruton as the Governor-General of the separatist faction of French Algeria. Regarding this matter, according to various American newspapers, the United States State Department and the United Kingdom Foreign Office did not recommend it. The New York Forum Daily recounted that Secretary of State Hull had acknowledged that the State Department initially opposed Peruton's appointment to this position, but this proposal received strong support from Roosevelt, and thus became a reality. As for the situation in Tunisia, the number of Axis troops is large, and they also have the convenience of shortened transportation lines. The situation of the Allied forces is naturally difficult. The London newspapers commented on the intricate news of the new government's political steps from Morocco and Algiers, saying, "The measures taken in Morocco to oppose the French national revival movement seem to be much looser than the measures taken by the new government in Algiers." The London Observer published an editorial saying that since Churchill and Roosevelt met in Casablanca, and Tegor and Gilow shook hands, there have been no changes in the political situation in North Africa. Some political prisoners in North Africa have been released, but the number is less than a quarter of the political prisoners who are still in concentration camps. The United Kingdom's policy towards French North Africa follows the following four principles: (1) Military affairs take precedence over politics, (2) The United Kingdom does not want to interfere in any country's internal affairs, (3) It is necessary to cooperate with local officials anytime, anywhere, (4) Maintain the spirit of Anglo-American unity. These four points are just four of the most reasonable points, but even for this point, there is not much achievement, which is regrettable.</p>

<p>Mobilizing 800,000 Workers to Dredge Waterways Along the Yellow River Bank</p>
<p>"Special Telegram from Tianjin" Due to the breach of the Yellow River during the Chongqing Army Incident, a new Yellow River emerged. In the North China region, especially the old Yellow River basin area, the reduction of underground water sources is gradually leading to desertification, making it necessary to divert the river northward. As an emergency measure in the North China agricultural production increase plan for the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), a waterway will be dredged from the Yellow River railway bridge on the old Beijing-Hankou Railway line to Xinxiang in the lower reaches, merging into the Wei River. This waterway will pass through the Nanyun Canal and be introduced into the Tianjin area, utilizing it for irrigation water for the downstream rice paddies of Tianjin. The outline has already been decided and is part of the recently announced agricultural production increase plan. The waterway should reach the Tianjin area no later than the beginning of June to provide irrigation for the downstream areas of Tianjin. Therefore, it is scheduled to start construction quickly in early February. The project extends 50 kilometers from the Yellow River bank to Xinxiang, is 17 meters wide and 1.80 meters deep. It will mobilize 10,000 workers daily, totaling 800,000 people. Currently, it is temporarily used for irrigation water for the rice paddies in the Tianjin area. A larger-scale water diversion project is under study, aiming to expand the water diversion route from the Yellow River in the future to provide irrigation for areas along the route.

<p>A letter from the Coal Association to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association states: "Regarding the control of non-controlled coal and the eradication of the black market, with the gradual completion of the control mechanism, and your cooperation in various aspects, the coordination of coal is gradually becoming smoother, and a clear and bright future is in sight.

The authorities specifically value this and have repeatedly discussed it with our association, seeking effective measures to achieve real improvement. However, the so-called non-controlled coal and the emergence of the black market each have their backers, and relying solely on the power of our association to eradicate them thoroughly is truly difficult. It is essential to mobilize the full power of your association and your fellow traders to make an all-out effort. The only simple and easy method is that your association and your fellow traders, regardless of the circumstances,</p>

<p>In non-controlled coal, or stop operating immediately. In short, (1) those belonging to the allocation mechanism who lack a sense of morality will not be allowed. (2) Those who lack a sense of morality will not be treated with leniency or care, and their allocation will be stopped immediately. Despite repeated orders, our association will contact the Shanghai Municipal Council police and other relevant parties to meet the authorities' expectations. We hope you will strictly supervise all your fellow traders and promptly stop operating non-controlled coal and all illegal transactions (except those specially permitted by the authorities).

<p>The Joint Office of the Miscellaneous Grains Group in this city has been ordered to handle the allocation of soybeans. The changes to the soybean allocation regulations have now been submitted to the authorities for approval as follows: Grocery stores and small retailers can only sell raw soybeans to the public and cannot process raw soybeans into cooked products for direct sale. In addition to the officially prescribed price in military scrip, 48 yuan and 50 cents per dan (unit of weight), retailers with storefronts are allowed to add one yuan of soybean price in military scrip per dan to compensate for the cost of returning empty bags. (2) Cooked food retailers, including soy sauce shops, distilleries, tofu shops, roasted goods shops, soy product shops, soy milk stalls, and bean sprout businesses, are processed foods that already have a profit margin and should not be treated the same as raw food merchants. They are not entitled to the one-yuan subsidy on the official price. They can only process raw soybeans into cooked food to sell to the public and cannot sell raw soybeans directly. If violations are found upon investigation, their allocation will be suspended and they will be appropriately punished. In addition to the gunny sacks made by the designated manufacturer, they are all printed with the designated logo, which has been requisitioned by the authorities. All sacks sold must be returned to the designated location unconditionally within one week for submission to the authorities for cancellation.</p>

<p>— Yin Liang</p>
<p>Draft of a New Year's Group Gathering Discussion</p>
<p>Outline: (1) Great Capacity, Great Fortune. (2) The Lesser Self and the Greater Self. (3) Preserving Wealth is Not as Good as Not Being Wealthy: Enriching the Masses is the Only Way to Enrich Oneself. (4) A Steady Stream of Water Flows Forever; Abundance is Never Exhausted.</p>
<p>Because I oppose extravagant customs, my family has been celebrating New Year's and other festivals for over a decade just like any other day, without adding dishes or hosting guests. I don't visit people to offer New Year's greetings, and they don't come to my house to return the visits. I often say that every day is New Year's Eve for me, and also New Year's Day; because every day I cautiously settle the accounts of my spiritual and material gains and losses, and also happily chat and laugh with friends. When I first implemented this idea, some relatives and friends still found it "hard to avoid convention," but I stuck to my principle of no reciprocation, and eventually they stopped coming altogether. I understand that "not reciprocating" is "impolite." However, because I don't have gifts, I've saved my relatives and friends a lot of waste, and I myself have reduced a lot of financial and time expenses. This year, relatives and friends initiated a group gathering, taking advantage of the holiday to get together, drink a cup of tea, and talk about each other's insights. I wholeheartedly approve of this approach and think it's worth promoting, so I'm very happy to be asked to say a few words.</p>
<p>Today's topic was suggested by my mother. She thought that I have been considering the meaning of life a lot in recent years, and she believed that I must have some insights. However, to be honest, regarding research on the meaning of life, I am still just a primary school student. How easy it is for me to have any insights. Today, in front of all of you relatives and friends, I will simply report what I have learned, heard, and experienced, and I hope everyone will correct me.</p>
<p>(1) Great Capacity, Great Fortune</p>
<p>During the New Year, one should say auspicious words. I wish you all more fortune in the New Year. However, I would like to tell you a secret to having more fortune: If you want fortune, you must have great capacity.</p>
<p>The explanation of the word "fortune" is very abstract and general. The "Book of Rites: Sacrificial Rituals" says, "Fortune is completeness, and completeness is the name for preparedness. Being unimpeded in everything is called fortune." But in reality, where in the world is there a situation where everything goes smoothly without a single setback, and where in human society is there a life where everything goes as desired? Therefore, according to my understanding, the explanation of fortune is more focused on the spiritual aspect and less focused on the material aspect. People with great fortune naturally feel very happy in favorable circumstances, and they feel just as happy in adverse circumstances. In other words, spiritual joy is fortune, and fortune is spiritual joy.</p>
<p>The meaning of "capacity" is very clear. As the saying goes, "A prime minister's belly can hold a boat." It also says, "To be tolerant is to be human." It would be very good to use the word "tolerance" to explain the word "capacity". The character "容" (rong) means "to contain," and the character "量" (liang) means "quantity." A house can contain things, which is great. Air can contain everything, which is a large amount. As the saying goes, "A pot of water can hold a liter," which is the same idea.</p>
<p>Why can tolerant people have great fortune? Because tolerant people can contain everything, they can remain calm in both favorable and adverse circumstances. As the saying goes, "The sage's heart is like still water," and "One must be able to hold one's breath." Only those with "a heart like still water" can "hold their breath"; only those who "hold their breath" can obtain lasting spiritual joy. Those who cannot hold their breath will definitely blame heaven and others when faced with adversity, and those who blame heaven and others will definitely not feel happy spiritually. Therefore, capacity is the basis for great fortune.</p>
<p>A person's capacity is not something they are born with, and great capacity cannot be achieved overnight. It is achieved through many experiences, many insights, and accumulated over time. Therefore, even a wise man like Guan Zhong, Confucius still said, "Guan Zhong's capacity is small." However, there are two key points that can transform small capacity into great capacity, which I want to specifically discuss.</p>
<p>First, open up your horizons. We all know that those who are trapped in a small village are ignorant, have shallow knowledge, and have narrow minds. They consider themselves extraordinary and cannot be offended; when they encounter setbacks, they will beat their children and scold others. Why? Because their vision is limited to their small village. They are frogs in a well and do not know that outside the village there are towns, outside the towns there are cities, and beyond that there are countries, the world, and the entire universe. If their horizons could be expanded to be as large as the universe, they would know how insignificant they are, and they would naturally have the capacity to tolerate everything; they would naturally not take offense at anything that goes against their wishes; their knowledge would naturally be enlightened, and their minds would naturally be broad.</p>
<p>Second, focus on objectivity. Mencius said, "Arrow makers fear they will not injure people, while armor makers fear injuring people." He also said, "In years of plenty, the children of the rich are often lazy; in years of famine, the children of the poor are often violent." Both arrow makers and armor makers are artisans, but their purposes are different. The children of the rich and the children of the poor are both children, but their characters are different. Why? It is entirely due to the relationship with the objective environment. It turns out that human affairs in the world are all influenced by the objective environment, so we don't need to be happy or resentful; we should be tolerant. Lao Tzu said, "The sage is always good at saving people, so there are no abandoned people; he is always good at saving things, so there are no abandoned things." These are truly insightful words.</p>
<p>Third, understand the nature of things. Throughout history, from top to bottom and in all directions, countless people and countless things, on the surface, seem chaotic and complicated, but in fact, they all have a certain cyclical pattern. This pattern is what scientists and philosophers want to study. Those who study wireless electricity understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism; those who study sound films understand the relationship between light and sound; those who study physics understand the relationship between light and electricity; those who study life understand the principles of the cycle of change in human affairs. Buddhists say: birth, dwelling, change, and extinction. Just like plants, they sprout in spring, blossom and leaf in summer, and wither in autumn. If we understand this law, we can know that the changes in the whole world are all "inevitable and certain." There is no need to be angry, joyful, or hateful. Lao Tzu said, "The superior man is calm and at ease; the inferior man is always anxious." Only those who know the constant can be tolerant, and only those who are calm and at ease can be called superior men.</p>
<p>(2) The Lesser Self and the Greater Self</p>
<p>Those who study the philosophy of life mostly oppose this "self." Confucianism emphasizes self-restraint, Taoism emphasizes the absence of self, Buddhism emphasizes the removal of self, and Christianity emphasizes universal love. The basic concept is to eliminate this private "self."</p>
<p>Why oppose "self"? Why eliminate this private "self"? Because "self" is fundamentally sinful, and the disasters that arise from this sin can affect the entire world and all of humanity. Those who read European history know that the 18th century was the pivotal point of modern thought. The starting point of modern thought lies in the self-awareness of "self." From this time on, individualism raised its head, politics slowly transitioned to democracy, and economics used the banner of this democratic politics to transition to free capitalism. But what was the result? For one or two hundred years, we have only seen the struggle between "me" and "you," the oppression of "me" and "you," and the exploitation of "me" and "you."</p>
<p>You must know that when a person is born into this world, they do not know they have a self. By the time they know they have a self, there are already many "yous" and many "others" nurturing, protecting, and educating them. And they know they have a self, and at the same time, they know there is you and him. If a person is confined to a desolate island with no one else, no you, no him, then "I" cannot exist at all. I call this individual "self" the "lesser self"; I call the "you" and "him" outside of this "self" the "greater self." The greater self is part of the lesser self. There is the greater self first, then there is the lesser self. Without the greater self, the lesser self will also be fundamentally eliminated.</p>
<p>The scope of the greater self can be broad or narrow. In terms of a family, an individual is the lesser self, and the family is the greater self. In terms of a people, an individual is the lesser self, and the people are the greater self. In terms of a country, the ethnic groups and families are the lesser self, and the country is the greater self. In terms of the world, countries are the lesser self, and the world is the greater self. The more knowledgeable a person is, the larger the scope of the greater self. The farther a person's vision extends, the wider the scope of the greater self.</p>
<p>From the relationship between the greater self and the lesser self, we can discover the highest standard of morality. We can say that all behaviors that benefit the greater self are good and moral; all behaviors that harm the greater self are bad and immoral. Some things are beneficial to the greater self and also beneficial to the lesser self; of course, we should do them. Some things are beneficial to the greater self but harmful to the lesser self; we should also do them based on the standpoint of the greater self. At the same time, the wider the scope of the greater self, the higher the level of morality. Therefore, Buddhism's universal salvation of all living beings, Jesus's universal love, Confucianism's all under heaven are one family, the great harmony of the world, and Japan's "covering the eight corners and making them one roof" are all the highest standards of morality and ideals that everyone should have.</p>
<p>I just said that some things are beneficial to the greater self but harmful to the lesser self, and we should do them. Although that's what I said, the reality is not like that. Because things that are beneficial to the greater self will never harm the lesser self. Originally, the greater self is the lesser self, and the interests of the greater self are the interests of the lesser self. So, although on the surface it may seem harmful to the lesser self, in reality, if the greater self benefits, the lesser self will not be harmed. Lao Tzu said, "The more he does for others, the more he has; the more he gives to others, the more he possesses." As the saying goes, "Give others convenience, and you will have convenience yourself," which is the same idea.</p>
<p>(3) Preserving Wealth is Not as Good as Not Being Wealthy; Enriching the Masses is the Only Way to Enrich Oneself</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Nie Yuntai's method of preserving wealth, and I felt a lot. Mr. Nie advised people not to be wealthy, and even further advised people to shift their thoughts from preserving wealth to enriching the masses. I think there are only two points to Mr. Nie's true meaning: first, preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy; second, enriching the masses is the only way to enrich oneself.</p>
<p>Wealth cannot be guarded forever. Lao Tzu said, "When gold and jade fill the hall, none can protect them." He also said, "Great hoards invite great loss." This is the theory, stated clearly and plainly. As for the facts, Mr. Nie said it even more clearly. The final conclusion is: "The wealthy people I have seen in recent decades have all declined in later generations; the prominent families of civil and military officials for the past sixty years have all declined, and their descendants have not prospered." Because private wealth is a kind of sin. Mr. Nie said, "Whether you are greedy for money or not is greatly related to a person's interests and happiness. Getting rich can create sin, while not being greedy for money can create blessings." Therefore, wealthy families are bound to become poor, just as the most wicked criminals cannot escape the law. Wealth does not have an absolute standard, and it is difficult to define wealth; however, wealth at least contains two meanings: first, having; and second, having more than enough. However, because you have, others will not have; because you have more than enough, others will not have enough. Furthermore, because a few people "have," many people "do not have"; because a few people "have more than enough," many people "do not have enough." This is a clear fact, so heaven must use the excess to make up for the deficiencies, so that there is a kind of invisible restriction in the world. Only those who are not wealthy will not be subject to this restriction. Therefore, Mr. Nie said, "Only those who are unwilling to get rich and advance can avoid disaster." Lin Zexu's ban on opium is the best example. He did not want to harm the people of the whole country for the sake of his personal wealth. After his death, his family had no savings, but his descendants continued to be scholars for generations, which shows that preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy.</p>
<p>But everyone is born with desires. Everyone wants to be permanently fed and clothed, live in a good house, and have good entertainment. How can we achieve this goal? I say, it's very simple. Only when everyone can be fed and clothed will you be able to be permanently fed and clothed; only when everyone can live in a good house and have good entertainment will you be able to permanently live in a good house and have good entertainment. Only the interests of the greater self are the permanent interests of the lesser self; the individual interests of the lesser self are not permanent. The Huayan Sutra says: "If you make all beings happy, you will make all Tathagatas happy." Mr. Nie said, "If you want to gain blessings, you must create more blessings for others." He also said, "Those who have extremely high positions and many opportunities to get rich, but are unwilling to get rich and are always thinking of helping others, will have the most prosperous and long-lasting descendants." Fan Zhongyan was unwilling to use the Southern Garden of Suzhou as his private garden, but donated it to become the school of Suzhou, so that the children of Suzhou could all study, and at the same time, his children could also study forever. This is the principle that Confucianism says, "It is better to enjoy happiness with others than to enjoy it alone. If the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient?" Looking at it in the current environment, it feels even more intimate and meaningful. It can be seen that we must first make everyone rich, so that individuals can enjoy the pleasure of wealth, so it is said: "Enriching the masses is the only way to enrich oneself."</p>
<p>(4) Finally, I would like to offer everyone a way to be a person. Zeng Guofan said, "In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status cannot be maintained. Only diligence and frugality can last." What I mean by a steady stream of water is diligence; what I mean by abundance is never exhausted is frugality.</p>
<p>Those who have been to Tiantai and Yandang and seen the waterfalls can appreciate their greatness. Those who have been to Haining and seen the autumn tides can appreciate their magnificence. Those who have been to Hangzhou and seen the Eighteen Streams of Nine Creeks can appreciate their charm. However, the water of the waterfalls sometimes dries up. When the water dries up, the waterfalls can no longer be great; the autumn tides of Haining are the largest on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, and are not magnificent at other times; only the small streams of the Eighteen Streams of Nine Creeks permanently retain their charm, day and night.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I recited the two lines, "When the mountains and rivers are heavy, one doubts there is no road; the willows are dark, and the flowers are bright, and another village appears," but I couldn't imagine what kind of joy it would bring. Later, whenever I climbed mountains, I often encountered such a scene, and I felt an indescribable joy in my heart, and I finally understood the meaning of the poem. Therefore, I don't linger over the mountain scenery that is clear at a glance; I wander back and forth among the looming mountain peaks, unable to leave. Why? Because one is exhaustible, and one is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>The loveliness of a steady stream of water lies in its long flow; the reason why it can flow long is because its water is fine. Everyone knows that being a person requires diligence, not just a burst of diligence, but permanent diligence. For example, when climbing a mountain, if you walk very fast at once, then you will definitely be exhausted halfway up the mountain and unable to move; those who know how to climb a mountain always walk up step by step, slowly, and they will not feel tired when they reach the top of the mountain. The same is true for climbing a mountain, the same is true for reading, and the same is true for being a person. Zhuge Liang said, "Tranquility leads to far," only those who are tranquil can reach far, so the effort of the word diligence lies in the steady stream of water.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that being a person requires frugality, and most people refer to money, but in fact, we must be frugal in spirit, body, and money. For example, when playing football, those who don't know how will run around on the field, and before the first half is over, they will be panting like a cow and unable to continue. Those who know how to play football will never overexert themselves. They will just quietly guard their feet and kick until the end of the game, still looking calm and collected, with energy to spare. For example, when singing opera, the preciousness of Tan Xinpei is not that he sings "into the clouds" as soon as he comes on stage. He just cherishes his voice and sings slowly and with more energy, so that the audience, until the end of the performance, still has the impression of "lingering sound lingering" and leaving an impression of "abundance is never exhausted." Taoists say "If the spirit is too tired, it will be exhausted, and if the body is too tired, it will be exhausted." In fact. No matter what the matter is, the result of being too tired is always not lasting; only those who have "abundance is never exhausted" can avoid being exhausted and can last for a long time, so the effort of the word frugality lies in "abundance is never exhausted."</p>
<p>I have said many rambling words, so I will stop here. I hope everyone will give me advice and wish everyone a happy New Year!</p>

<h3 id="e75">Smuggling Suppression Work Effective; Smuggling Gradually Declines; Two Cases Seized in the Tenth Batch <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>In order to resolutely prevent the evil trend of smuggling and increase tax revenue, the Jianghai Customs has been working hard to suppress smuggling. In addition to ordering all of its tax police to strictly suppress smuggling, it is also rewarding all circles for reporting tips and dividing the proceeds from punishments as rewards. The progress has been very smooth. Yesterday, it was learned from the General Affairs Section of the Customs that since the Customs has been cracking down on smuggling, unscrupulous merchants have become wary and have no intention of continuing to smuggle goods. This situation is related to national tax revenue and is truly commendable. Here are the details of the tenth batch of smuggled goods seized and punished by the Customs: (1) 21 pieces of peanuts belonging to Fu Tingxiang, 11 bicycles. The goods were fined 5,976 yuan, and the transit tax was paid. The bicycles were confiscated. (2) 5 rolls of cotton cloth belonging to Tang Sanhe, all of which were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e76">New Regulations for Bicycle Licenses in the Two Concessions <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Starting today, the two concessions will implement new regulations for bicycle licenses. Henceforth, residents of both concessions who own bicycles must adhere to the newly established procedures when obtaining their licenses for this quarter.</p>
<p>Police to Handle Licensing Matters</p>
<p>To reduce bicycle theft, the authorities have transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council's tax offices to the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Department. Reportedly, the main reason for this measure is to make it easier for the police to investigate the activities of bicycle thieves.</p>
<p>Licensing Fee: 31 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting today, the police in both concessions have officially begun handling license issuance. Anyone who owns a bicycle and is unclear about the new regulations can directly inquire at the licensing offices at Fuzhou Road (International Settlement) and Avenue Dubail (French Concession) Central Police Station. The total licensing fee is 31 yuan, which includes all donation fees, license plate fees, and registration fees.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Bicycle Owners Urged to Obtain Application Forms Soon to Avoid Problems <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from the Public Works Department's Traffic Section, bicycle owners should obtain application forms between the 8th and 13th of this month. However, few people have visited the offices on Fourth Avenue, Gordon Road, and Rue Massenet to obtain these forms. As a result, obtaining a license may become problematic later on. All bicycle owners must quickly obtain the application forms within these few days to have their bicycles inspected, stamped, and licensed on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Bicycle Registration Procedures in the City Area <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>To coordinate with the two concessions and prevent bicycle theft, the Public Utilities Bureau has issued the following regulations for bicycle registration: (1) Bicycle registration should be based on the bicycle owner's evening parking address when applying for registration with the relevant authorities. (2) When applying for registration, bicycle owners should present their citizen ID card or residence permit for verification to ensure they are residents of the district before registration is approved. (3) A steel stamp number should be imprinted on the bicycle frame, seat, and sturdy area below the handlebars. The number should match the magnetic plate for easy verification. (4) A registration fee of five yuan and a magnetic plate fee of two yuan will be charged. The half-year bicycle tax remains at twenty-four yuan. If the bicycle ownership is transferred, a transfer fee of five yuan will be charged. The bureau has reportedly informed all offices and vehicle registration points to comply with these regulations, which will be implemented on February 15th. It has also been announced that residents living in the city area who mistakenly obtain licenses from the Special District will be severely punished. All bicycle owners are urged to pay close attention.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Cooperation Between the Two Concessions to Ban Pufferfish <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language *North-China Daily News*, the heads of the health departments of the International Settlement and the French Concession, Yoshiaki Tashiro and Borde, jointly discussed preventing residents from being poisoned by eating pufferfish at the Public Works Department Health Office yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Close Attention to Fish Sources</p>
<p>This year, 50 people have died in the International Settlement from eating pufferfish. Yoshiaki Tashiro, head of the Public Works Department Health Office, reiterated to reporters yesterday, urging the public not to buy pufferfish from street vendors. Reportedly, the previous large-scale poisoning was due to vendors smuggling pufferfish during the New Year holiday. Tashiro stated that the pufferfish was transported from Wusong via Pudong to the Yangshupu district, leading to large numbers of workers purchasing it. The Public Works Department Health Office and the Central Fish Market authorities are now cooperating to closely monitor the sources of all fish.</p>
<p>Secret Sales Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Reportedly, Health Office inspectors are conducting daily investigations in all areas where pufferfish might be secretly sold. Large quantities of pufferfish are often confiscated and destroyed from vendors and carriers. Since the Public Works Department Health Office banned the sale of pufferfish in the International Settlement, the routes for selling pufferfish have been cut off, so vendors are selling it elsewhere, transporting it to Shanghai. However, the authorities have decided to severely punish such violators. As for the secret sales locations, the authorities have learned about them from poisoned patients in hospitals.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Cooperate to Ban</p>
<p>Yoshiaki Tashiro also revealed that no unfortunate incidents have occurred within the Suzhou Creek. The International Settlement Health Office is cooperating with the French Concession Health Office to ban the sale of pufferfish. He also pointed out that pufferfish must be thoroughly cleaned of its blood before cooking. Furthermore, according to Yangshupu Hospital, of the 107 workers poisoned by eating pufferfish during the Lunar New Year, 20 have died as of the day before yesterday, while the remaining 87 are in good condition. Although some are in critical condition, their lives may be spared. Borde of the French Municipal Council Health Office told a *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reporter yesterday afternoon that the French authorities will cooperate with the Public Health Department of the International Settlement to prohibit the private sale of pufferfish. The French Concession has banned the sale of pufferfish in the past, so no cases of pufferfish poisoning have been found. In fact, the fish in the French Concession markets are transported from the Central China Fish Market. Therefore, after the fish market banned the sale of pufferfish, it became impossible to sell pufferfish in the French Concession markets.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Uniform Standard of Hot Water Buckets in the City Area Must Be Completed Before Mid-Month; Non-Compliance Will Be Punished According to Law <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Hot Water Shop Guild of this city, in order to comply with the order to standardize the hot water buckets used by all businesses in the city area to a standard capacity of 1000 CC, has made arrangements to produce new hot water buckets. Starting in the latter part of last month, distribution to the relevant businesses in the four districts began. Many have gone to exchange their buckets in recent days, while others are still waiting to see. Yesterday, the guild announced that all new water buckets must be exchanged by the 15th of this month. If they are not exchanged within the stipulated time, the guild will report to the authorities, who will impose penalties in accordance with the law, including suspending operations for a few days as a warning. It is also understood that the guild is rushing to produce standard hot water buckets for the hot water shops in the two Special Districts. As soon as they are ready, a notice will be issued.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Steles and Calligraphy (II) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— By Yun Jian Bai Jiao</p>
<p>In his essay "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy," he says:</p>
<p>"Ancient stone inscriptions record the merits of emperors or inscribe the virtues and positions of ministers to assist historical studies. Therefore, ancient calligraphers invariably entrusted their works to metal and stone to pass them on. The Qin inscriptions are clearly called 'metal and stone inscriptions.' The flourishing of stele inscriptions in the Former and Later Han Dynasties produced a plethora of calligraphers. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, mountains, rivers, temples, and tombs all had inscriptions carved in stone, which were most rule-abiding. Descending to the Western Jin and Northern Dynasties, the Han stele inscriptions in the Central Plains were well-established. Scholars admired them, imitating and studying them. When compiling the Books of Jin and the Southern and Northern Dynasties, they described famous calligraphers as being good at [Zhuanshu] seal script, cursive script, regular script, or semi-cursive script, but those who excelled in inscription calligraphy were the most respected. In those days, if one was not good at inscription calligraphy, one could not become a calligrapher.</p>
<p>Calligraphy began as signatures on silk scrolls (as seen in the *Shuowen Jiezi*). Later generations classified any small piece of paper that treasured calligraphy as calligraphy. The modelbooks in the imperial collection today are not stele inscriptions. This is because the Southern Dynasties prohibited carving inscriptions on stele inscriptions, resulting in very few stele inscriptions (as seen in the *Zhaoming Wenxuan*). Calligraphy was valued, completely transforming into regular, semi-cursive, and cursive scripts, without any remnants of ancient ideas. ...During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, folk reproductions of calligraphy were mostly done by artisans, and the writing style was still close to that of the inscription. This is quite different from the *Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection*, which could not be transformed by ordinary literati."</p>
<p>At the same time, he also said:</p>
<p>"Northern Dynasty stele characters have too many broken forms, especially because the characters are mixed with [Fenli] official script. During times of war, no one taught or studied, leading to confusion of the six scripts and local ignorance creating characters." - From "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy."</p>
<p>"The Northern Dynasty clans were simple and unadorned, not valuing elegance and sticking to old methods, rarely willing to be flexible. Only during times of chaos were their styles vulgar and lowly, ...with too many broken forms, which officials like Yan Zhitui and Jiang Shi corrected." - From "Categorization of Southern and Northern Calligraphy."</p>
<p>He also admits:</p>
<p>(Short scrolls allow for free expression, so calligraphy excels in this;</p>
<p>(2) Stele inscriptions have strict boundaries and profound calligraphy, so stele inscriptions have the advantage." - Both from "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy."</p>
<p>It can be seen that his discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of steles and calligraphy is very open-minded. However, looking at these two articles, his theory of dividing into southern and northern schools, whether from a geographical perspective or from the perspective of individual people, his systematic explanation is not satisfactory, and in fact, it is impossible to make it satisfactory, and it will only become more and more confusing. Because the division of regions and people, and the division of the calligraphy styles of various families, to be able to clearly divide north and south, the difficulty or impossibility is just about the same as the division of north and south schools or a certain school or a certain school in other academic aspects. I can't help but try to talk about the topic of stele inscriptions and calligraphy itself. For example, taking Yan Lugong's works, Family Temple Stele, Magu Xiantan Ji, Yan Qinli, etc. are stele inscriptions; General Pei's Stele of Contending for Seats, Sacrificial Stele Draft, Three Memorials, etc. are calligraphy. In terms of people, he is from Shandong and belongs to the Northern School. In terms of writing style, his characters are close to He Ming, which belongs to the Southern School. Now, let's ignore Lugong for the moment, and just look at Zhong, Wang, Ou, and Chu in Ruan's two articles. Isn't his division already quite difficult to arrange properly? As for him saying that the unification of calligraphy is due to the emperors' love for it, that is only one side of the story. - This reason will be discussed in detail below. - After Ruan started the trend, Bao and Kang simply erected the banner of "Respecting Steles and Disdaining Calligraphy," honoring Wei and Tang dynasties. Although they respected Ruan, they had already changed their tune! Their scholarship was mediocre, their attitude was very extreme, and their rhetoric could not be established with sincerity. They liked to use their own ideas to make claims, and many of those they liked were hated by good people, and those they hated were liked by bad people. They ultimately wanted to compare the characters of stonemasons and potters to Zhong and Wang, just as Shen Bo's discussion liked to make source theories of who came from whom, which seemed to trace back to the source, but was actually lacking in historical knowledge and absurd in judgment: Changsu praised even the most infamous images, such as the stele of Qi Bei Junxiu Luo and the stele of the Sui Dynasty Ashina Duzan, as wonderful, while also deeply criticizing the Yutian Wang type in the Longmen Twenty Items, all of which are biased arguments!</p>
<p>Why is it said that Bao and Kang's greatest argument for suppressing calligraphy is to follow Ruan? What did Ruan say? In his theory of Southern and Northern Calligraphy, there is a passage:</p>
<p>"The Song calligraphy has been re-engraved many times and cannot be traced back. The seals of Han emperors and Qin ministers are all falsely created. How can the calligraphy of Zhong, Wang, and Xie be like the original stone inscriptions of the various stele inscriptions of the present dynasty!"</p>
<p>Originally, the human psychology of disliking the old and liking the new is something that people of ancient and modern times may not be immune to: the attitude of trusting hearsay instead of seeing for oneself is also the same for people of ancient and modern times who are unwilling to use their eyes and brains. Therefore, if something is indeed a research-based text, people will regard it as an ironclad case. Ruan's two major articles, presumably, Shen Bo and Changsu only read the above few sentences, and were suddenly struck by inspiration, and then became curious and used their own minds to vigorously promote and swear to like it; and later generations regarded it as a conclusion. In fact, regarding the fallacies of the imperial calligraphy, Qia Tie, such as Song Huang Bosi, had a Stele Engraving of the Imperial Calligraphy, and Qing Liang Shanzhou had a Chunhua Secret Stele Examination and Correction, all of which were before Ruan, and Ruan had certainly already read them. As for the stele inscriptions being used to collect materials, it was originally the same situation as the calligraphy. And the good or bad of the collection is something that both those who collect calligraphy and those who study stele inscriptions pay attention to.</p>
<p>Why is it said that Bao and Kang's rhetoric is not based on sincerity? Because they very much hope that you call people to learn stele inscriptions and learn souls, but when they describe where they have gained their strength, they are actually talking about calligraphy with great interest! - See the article on describing calligraphy (Shen Bo) and the article on describing learning (Chang Su) - Isn't that exactly what the saying goes, "slapping yourself in the face"?</p>
<p>In the past, when I read Shen Bo and Chang Su's writings, I wanted to write an article to correct them. Later, I saw that Zhu Dake had an article criticizing Bao Shenbo and Kang Changsu on calligraphy (Oriental Magazine, Volume 27, No. 2, Special Issue on Chinese Art), which can truly be said to have preempted my thoughts. That article really contributed to the study of calligraphy, and his arguments are very pertinent. The original text is quite long, so I won't quote it here. If you are studying this issue, it is a very good reference material.</p>
<p>I generally agree with Ruan's views on the stele inscriptions and calligraphy themselves. Because I can't help but think that when learning calligraphy, we should know the shortcomings of calligraphy; when learning stele inscriptions, we should also understand the shortcomings of stele inscriptions. Take the strengths of stele inscriptions to make up for the shortcomings of calligraphy; take the strengths of calligraphy to make up for the shortcomings of stele inscriptions, that is exactly the spirit that scholars should have! Regarding the comparison between the two, I think that:</p>
<p>A. The intrinsic value of stele inscriptions and calligraphy cannot be judged solely on whether they are directly inscribed on stone or not. Original carvings and early rubbings, whether stele inscriptions or calligraphy, are equally valuable.</p>
<p>B. It is hard to believe that stele inscriptions, carved on stone, can be hammered and chiseled by stonemasons without losing any of the original calligraphy.</p>
<p>C. The better re-engraved copies of calligraphy still retain their original form, but many of the original carvings of steles in the imperial court, whether the calligraphy is by a calligrapher or by a stonemason who is not very literate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese merchant stock market initially declined, but around 11:30 AM, it suddenly rebounded. The main reason for this was that the public utility stocks and cultural industry stocks not only did not decline, but instead prospered independently, and Yong'an Company in the department store industry was also acquired by investors with real power. This greatly motivated people from all sides. At noon, all stocks were covered by a buying spree. The 90-yuan mark for Zhabei Water and Electricity was broken, and then it rebounded sharply. It initially fell to 87.5 yuan, and then soared to 94.3 yuan, an increase of another two yuan. China General Edison fell from 65 yuan to 60 yuan at one point, and finally rebounded to 64 yuan, a slight decrease of one yuan. The Commercial Press hovered around 650 yuan. There were transactions of 250 yuan for China, and the final entry and exit prices for World were 140 yuan and 45 yuan, respectively, all stable. Yong'an Company was pushed up to 173 yuan by large investors from 165 yuan, a single increase of one yuan. Sincere was stable, around 172.5 yuan. National Goods Corporation was down slightly at 85.7 yuan. Innerwear (New) was as low as 50 cents to 22 yuan. Great China Match fell below 400 yuan, down 15 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco also fell 13 yuan to around 165 yuan. In the textile industry, Yong'an Cotton Mill fell to 390 yuan, rebounding to 410 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was at 600 yuan, and No. 3 Factory was at 500 yuan. There was little supply and high demand. The weaving factories, Daguangming and Hongyu, each fell by 2.5 cents. Xinfeng Printing fell below 20 yuan, rebounding to around 21 yuan at noon. Xinfa's selling price was 19.5 yuan. There were buyers for Guoguang at 14 yuan and Yousheng at 12.5 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinya was at 26.5 yuan and Zhongfa at 32 yuan, both stable. Minyi fell to 65 yuan, Central China was traded at 480 yuan, Xinyi was at 300 yuan, and Zhongfu Pharmaceutical rose to 550 yuan. Zhongxing Wood Industry debuted at 11 yuan, and trading was quite active. In the future, the business hours for Chinese stocks will be from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and business will continue as usual on Saturdays.</p>

<p>The market for government bonds suddenly changed very quickly and significantly yesterday. Initially, the decline was very sharp, with Type C breaking the 70-yuan mark, seeing a minimum price of 68 yuan. After entering this level, after 11:30 AM, a rebound suddenly occurred, and all bonds rose in a straight line. Type C broke through the 70-yuan mark again, seeing a high price of 50 cents, and it was not easy to buy in. Since the market price has turned red, it has fallen for three consecutive days, with a difference of seven or eight yuan between the high and low prices. The rebound was expected, as the floating supply had been exhausted, and the selling pressure had fallen sharply. Finally, several capitalists absorbed a large amount, and the price soared extremely sharply. After one rise and one fall, the buying side was ultimately strong. If the sellers replenish again today, we will see new market prices again. For other types, the small price for Type B was 5.5 yuan, and the final price was 7 yuan. Type D had the clearest trading, with a price of only 65.5 yuan, making it the lowest-priced and most cost-effective type in the entire bond market. The lowest for [illegible] was 6 yuan, and the final price was [illegible] yuan. The differences between the various competitions were significant, and today they should level out. The trend is due to the rise in popularity, and should continue to rise.</p>

<h3 id="e96">We Need Enthusiasm! <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Tao</p>
<p>Recently, to save coal, I often wash my face with cold water. But when the weather is too cold, I occasionally use some hot water—this has almost become a habit for me. However, even though the habit has been formed, my facial nerves' ability to distinguish between "cold" and "hot" remains, not numbed in the slightest. So, every morning, taking a hot face that's just emerged from the warm quilt and suddenly putting it up against cold water that's almost freezing—its unwelcome reception by the facial nerves is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the water I use to wash my face is steaming hot, though it's only a small amount, it often creates a feeling of "mutual enhancement" when it comes into contact with my hot face. But if the water's heat is lukewarm, warmer than the surrounding air but far less warm than my own face—washing my face at that time also feels quite uninteresting to me.</p>
<p>When people become worldly, facing a cold face with a hot face is such a thing that makes one come full of enthusiasm, but I make them leave disappointed and cold. This is not only unkind but also borders on cruel. Therefore, all those who are kind and good at adapting, even if they cannot always be "responsive to every request" and make everyone leave satisfied, at the very least, they can surely emit some enthusiasm, which is extremely needed by the other party, from their warm heart, so that the other party's eagerly expecting heart can at least receive some warm comfort and guidance, and not return frozen.</p>
<p>Interpersonal relationships cannot lack a certain element: enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is like a warm air, as lovely as winter sunshine. With it, humans will not feel coldness, but a feeling of harmony like spring.</p>
<p>I remember a foreign film called "The Cold-Faced Man." Fortunately, it was a comedy, making people laugh it off. If there really were such people in the world, it would be such a disappointing thing! Because cold-faced people in the world are like unnecessary cold air ducts, constantly spreading their cold air to the world, causing a terrible freezing effect in human society. On the contrary, what we need are enthusiastic and striving people, harmonious people, and people who always smile, because only they can turn a cold society into a warm one.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Michelangelo's Project One of the Letters of the World-Renowned Artist <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>Because Michelangelo Buonarroti (Aliehelmmgolo Buonarroli) was born in 1475. His paintings and sculptures possessed bold creativity and flawless technique, so he enjoyed fame at the age of twenty-one. When Pope Julius II summoned him to Rome, he was a ruthless and politically ambitious man who did not yet have a great understanding of art, but he knew what he wanted. At this time, he was summoned to build a tomb, a tomb befitting his status. The proposed plan resulted in "the tragedy of the tomb," which lasted for forty years. All his designs were large-scale, with the main building being three stories high, and there were forty bronze reliefs and marble statues.</p>
<p>It is said that the Pope would have demolished the meeting hall of St. Peter's Basilica to accommodate this huge building. However, things did not go smoothly. The Pope's leading architect, Bramante, wanted to replace Michelangelo with his own nephew Raphael, so he slandered the Florentine Michelangelo to the Pope. Michelangelo's dignity and pride were no less than the Pope's, so in a fit of anger, he fled back to Florence. The following letter is one he wrote to Giuliano (Pope’s other architect), in response to the Pope's summons for him to return and complete the tomb.</p>
<p>"...It will be a peerless project..."</p>
<p>Text Giuliano, a great master, the Pope's architect</p>
<p>Giuliano, I know from your letter that the Pope is angry about my departure and is willing for me to freely use money to complete the project we agreed upon; I also know that I can come back without fear of anything.</p>
<p>Regarding my departure, I can tell you the following facts: on Holy Saturday before Easter, I heard him talking to a jeweler about a court official, saying that he was unwilling to spend another penny on stone. This shocked me greatly. However, before I left, I still asked him for some money to continue working. He replied, telling me to go again on Monday: I went for four consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday—but he didn't see me. Finally, on Friday morning, I was asked to leave, that is, I was expelled! The person who asked me to leave said that he recognized who I was, but these were his orders. Therefore, having heard those words on Saturday and receiving such treatment in the following days, I lost all hope. However, this alone is not the entire reason for my departure. There is another reason, but I am unwilling to write it here; it is enough to make me think that if I had stayed in Rome, my own tomb might have been prepared before the Pope's tomb. That is the reason for my sudden departure.</p>
<p>Now you are writing to me on behalf of the Pope, and of course you will read this letter to the Pope. Please let His Holiness know... If he wants his tomb completed, it is best that he does not continue to anger me or ask me how far my work has progressed. I will always abide by my promise and complete this project within five years, on the burial site he has chosen, which is inside St. Peter's Basilica, and it will definitely become a beautiful project as I promised. Because I am certain that if this project is completed, it will be a peerless project.</p>
<p>If His Holiness wants to continue, please have the agreed-upon money handed over to a person in Florence, whose name I will tell you. ...Regarding the money and the project mentioned earlier, I am willing to follow His Holiness's guidance, and I can also provide him with any guarantees he requires in Florence. It is best that things are done the way they should be, and I can give him complete guarantees, even if the guarantee is the entirety of Florence. However, there is one more thing I must mention: the project may not succeed if it is carried out in Rome, but it can succeed here, because there are oaths and advantages here that Rome does not have. ...I ask you to give me a reply as soon as possible. Besides, there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Your Michelangelo</p>
<p>Sculptor, in Florence</p>
<p>May 2, 1506</p>
<p>Aftermath: The Pope issued three edicts and threatened to wage war against the Republic of Florence, only then did Michelangelo return to Rome. However, upon his return, he was not allowed to continue working on the tomb. After some trivial work, he was ordered to decorate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. For four years, he was virtually a prisoner, bravely carrying out that arduous labor, lying on his back high up, amid "the disturbances of mankind," exhausting the creation of the universe and the fall of man.</p>
<p>A year later, Julius II passed away. His inadequate successors and the succeeding Popes also interfered with Michelangelo, forcing him to change the plan of the tomb five times. The only result of forty years of efforts to fulfill the contract was the heroic statue of Moses; Craven once said that in this work, there was "the anger of forty years of bankruptcy and contraction, in which the artist's vision and the boundaries of reality collided and harmonized." Finally, the contract itself was destroyed by Pope Paul III, who ordered Michelangelo to paint "The Last Judgment" on the walls of the Sistine Chapel—many critics consider this painting "the greatest project completed by a single hand since the dawn of humanity."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Reading and Self-Cultivation <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Fu</p>
<p>We know that reading can not only increase knowledge but also cultivate virtue. Self-cultivation and doing things originally need to be honed in practice, not by relying on reading, but the words and deeds of the past seen in books can at least give us good stimulation, inspiration, and confirmation. This kind of help is really beneficial and indispensable.</p>
<p>What modern young people should pay special attention to is:</p>
<p>(1) We are born in this turbid society, and the temptations from the outside world are so strong. How can we keep ourselves from falling?</p>
<p>(2) Life in the world is always inevitable to have worries and suffering. When this kind of situation comes to us, how can we get spiritual comfort and avoid depression?</p>
<p>(3) If we want to accomplish a career or learning, we must go through many twists and turns. How can we keep our minds clear and continue our energy?</p>
<p>I think these three items are the most important turning points for self-cultivation. This kind of self-cultivation needs to rely on actual practice. If there is no preparation beforehand, then where can we start when things come to a head? There are only two kinds of preparations: one is the reminders and supervision of good teachers and helpful friends, and the other is the long-term immersion in the words and deeds of the past. Good teachers and helpful friends are more desirable than attainable, and the words and deeds of the past exist in books for us to pick up at any time. The greatest function and greatest benefit of reading on self-cultivation lies here.</p>
<p>The best materials for self-cultivation are reading biographies and letters of famous people. When reading biographies of famous people, it is not necessary to read them as history. You can specialize in reading them as self-cultivation books, see how they behave, how they do things, and how they pursue learning, and imagine what I would do if I were in his position. What would I do when faced with difficult things? We often use this kind of effort, which can not only hone virtue but also develop talent and wisdom. The predecessors' discussions on the benefits of reading history mostly focus on this point.</p>
<p>It is best to read the letters of famous people and their discussions with friends on daily matters and learning. Reading them is most beneficial to people's minds. If we can concentrate on reading letters exclusively, it will be very beneficial and interesting.</p>
<p>The reading methods mentioned above all take helping self-cultivation and doing things as their purpose. Confucius said: "Ancient scholars studied for themselves." Reading this kind of book is mainly for the purpose of directly benefiting themselves. Only by training oneself well can one truly be beneficial to society.</p>

<p>The Yi Guang Theater Troupe, which performs at the Lyceum Theatre, has been established for a short time, but its performance is getting better day by day. Recently, there have been rumors that the troupe will cooperate with the Zhong Zhong Theater Troupe, but the troupe authorities have strictly denied this. Cooperation is often a rumor.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music serves the community solely by performing authentic Western music.

<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>

<p>"Not the you I know—just like the you now. That's the important thing. In my mind, you will never grow up. Never. For example, when someone talks to me about our respected chairman of the board, I will think to myself, oh yes, a cheerful little boy, with his hair sticking straight up—absolutely unable to understand what the difference is between a noun and an adjective." (Loud laughter) "Uh, uh, I definitely can't say any more— humph, I could talk all night. Please think of me sometimes, I will definitely be thinking of you. Hsec olim meminisse juvabit. I still don't need to say any more." Much laughter, shouting, and prolonged cheers.</p>
<p>August 1913. Chips went to Wiesbaden to seek treatment, living in the room of a German teacher named Staefel, who was thirty years younger than him, but the two got along very well. In September, when the semester began, Chips returned and lived in Mrs. Wickett's house. He felt much stronger and more useful after the vacation, and he almost regretted his resignation. However, there were still many things he wanted to do. He invited all the former students to have tea. He paid attention to all the important matches on the Brookfield sports field. Once a semester, he dined with the principal and once with the teachers. He took on the preparation and editing work for the new "Brookfield Outlook." He accepted the position of chairman of the "Old Boys' Club" and often went to London to dine. He also occasionally wrote articles for Brookfield's regular magazine, which was full of jokes and Latin idioms. He read the "Times" newspaper every morning—reading it very thoroughly, and he also began to read detective novels—he had been addicted to them ever since Sherlock Holmes first appeared and caused a sensation. At that time, he was busy and happy.</p>
<p>A year later, in 1914, he attended the end-of-semester banquet again. This time, there was a lot of talk about war—the civil war in Ulster, and the dispute between Austria and Serbia. Staefel was leaving for Germany tomorrow and told Chips that he thought the Balkan events would not lead to anything. (33)</p>
