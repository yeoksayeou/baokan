<h3 id="c1">星期評論　論渝共內鬨 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 松軒</p>
<p>最近報章喧傳，渝共磨擦，又已進入火拚階段，我們對於這種消息，本來不加重視，因為渝共雙方的關係，正如英美與蘇聯的關係一樣，矛盾衛突，是其自然的現象，並不足奇，我們不要因為過分的注意渝共衝突，甚至誇張其事，而忽略了自已當前的事業。不過，當此世界戰局日趨嚴重，東亞各國之動向在決戰中的比重日益增加的時候，我們從各司靠方面所得消息，竟完全證明渝共之磨擦衝突，業已達到內戰的關頭，那麼，這一事件演變的結果，已不容續取保留熊度而應該嚴密注視了。</p>
<p>渝共再戰，早為一般識者意料所及。主要的原因，還是因為渝共雙方，雖在「抗戰建國」及「統一戰錢」口號下暫時停戰，但彼此都很明白，無非利用這些漂亮的口號，以維持及擴展其政權而已。因此，雙方上自領導人物，下至幹部，莫不互相戒備，雖曰停戰，但迄未合作，不僅迄未合作，而且停戰也是表面的，一一十九年的平江慘案，新舊軍戰爭，三十年的皖南事變等等，巳充分顯露渝共再戰的危機。所以未由局部而至全面化，一由於英美蘇聯的國際勢力之牽制，二由於渝共間中立黨派政團之居間調停，三由於中共之陰謀，不斷表示忍辱退讓，（雖然是表面上的），四由於渝方舉備尙未齊整。但是，自後大東亞戰爭以來，情勢大變，於是渝共衝突乃逐漸趨向於全面作戰階段。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭一年八個月以來的事態，為什麼促進了渝共的矛盾呢？　從國際方面說，英美在東亞的勢力開始總崩潰，因此對渝共特別是對重慶反共派的發言權受了相當的限制，英美為着誘取重慶對緬印作戰的協力及加强英美在西南的駐兵權，對西北問題，表示相當的讓步，其次荊是蘇聯為着全力對抗德國，也無力東顧，這是重慶反共派抬頭的國際因素。　從國內形勢言，由於東南走私路錢之斷絕，浙贛路之破壞，緬甸之失陷，滇南之崩潰，重慶政權的地盤開始動搖了。為圖最後掙扎計，重慶政權就積極採用强化「中央集權」政治和西北「中央化」政策。新疆之表面的屈服，更鼓勵了渝蔣對共用武的決心。　從和平區的發展來看，大東亞戰爭以來日本對華新政策的實　，和平區一切現象的改變，開始使重慶政權內部及其轄下人民對「抗戰」前途喪失信心，因此重慶政權有分崩離析的新危機，於是渝蔣乃有計劃的反共，一面把「抗戰」慘敗的完全推在中共破壞陰謀身上，一面以反共戰爭來挽回及振作人心。</p>
<p>為什麽到現在緯開始準備全面反共呢？其近因有三，第一，由於宋美齡宋子文對美外交活動的完全失敗。原來羅邱華盛頓會談時，二宋原企圖作為「四强之一國」的代表而參加，企圖改變邱吉爾先攻希特勒的戰略，實現先反攻太平洋，那時渝澳雙方，都很活躍。然而結果渝澳的夢想完全失敗，宋子文快快赴英，朱美齡狼狽返渝，而反共運動也就表面化了。第二，由於渝方各將領的動搖，大束亞戰爭以來，渝方將領，鑒於時勢趨勢，紛紛動搖，放棄抗戰，投降和運，為參加大東亞戰爭而獻身，影響所及，渝軍將領，有大部份動搖之虞，於是乃不得不發動反共戰爭，以圖挽救其末運。第三，是由於第三國際之解散，張滌非乃乘機主張解散中國共產黨，取消陝甘寧邊區，解除十八集國軍武裝。</p>
<p>全目前為止，渝共戰爭還只是些局部性的戰役，因此，在今天要作推論或結論，尙非其時。現在渝方以蔣介石的「中國之命運」一書為南針，一面企圖收拾人心，一面從思想上理論上展開反共運動，而渝方主持下的一切御用機關及文化團體，學術團體等，巳經紛紛致電毛澤東促其立即解散共產黨，取消邊區並解除十八集團軍武裝。所有渝方這種佈置，自然是大規模反共戰爭的前奏，和渝蔣過去歷次對付共反對派的手段如出一轍。至於中共方面，雖然在邊區等地，也是磨拳擦掌，有箭在弦上之勢，不過實際上中共軍力，已在華北遭遇日軍痛殲，傷亡慘重，，外强中乾，所以中共領導人物，還在力竭聲嘶於「政治解決」「反對內戰」。關於渝共戰爭，和平區人士，或有作過早的樂觀論者，我們認為是不應當的。因為，第一，中共在政治上的陰謀仍積極活動，這種活動，且深入渝方部隊。老實說，渝軍今日軍力，與西安事變時的東北軍相差無幾，其戰鬥力不能作過高的估計。第二，渝方反共，其實與中共之「反戰」一樣，無非一種維持政權的口號而已，「抗戰」都是虛偽的，今日之「反共」及「反戰」也是虛偽的。渝方反共而不與日本合作，決無成功可言。我們站在中國人民的立塲，自然不忍西北的同胞，在渝共的內亂中再受蹂躪與屠殺，因此，我們一而希望渝共中有識有志之士，下大決心，到和平區來：一而希望國府及友邦日本展開政治攻勢，迅速顚覆渝共政權，實現全面和平與國家眞正的統一。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日谷萩報道部長演講　大東亞戰爭目的　日本旨在解放東亞各邦　使其各得其所共存共榮 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，於七日下午五時，在神戶市立第一高等女學校，以大東亞戰爭之性格與發展為題，發表演講，茲録共大意如次：大東亞戰爭，為日本完遂皇國傳統使命之道義戰爭，茲就大東亞之防衛戰及建設戰之性格與其發展，略述所見，第一所謂防衛戰，此觀大束亞戰前日美進行交涉之經過，即為最明白表現。中國國父孫中山先生，曾謂「無日本即無束亞」，但英美竟企圖壓制日本，以逞其制覇束亞之野心，彼等此種野心，始於日俄戰後，至第一次世界大戰後，即更露骨，九一入事變後，又頓趨激化，及至中日事變，更公然　蔣，助長束亞禍亂，且勾引英國結成所謂對日包　陣，以經濟絕交加强咸脅日本之生存，幾經和平折衝，終告無效。日本為自存自衛，乃奮然而起，以現在情勢而觀，敵正面包圍日木，伺隙採取大規模而有統制之軍事行動，以迫日本本土，日木對此、可謂正於靜的期間中，準備次期之大反攻，共次，就建設戰之性格而言　　日本根本思想</p>
<p>日本建新東亞之　水思想，旨在根據八絃一宇之大理想，即使　邦各得其所，兆民各安其業，此種大理想，刻正在大東亞着着實現，例如南方之被壓民族，均已認識此次戰爭之意義，而熱烈協力，此即思想建設進展之明微。再觀經濟建設，則此次戰爭，顯為消耗戰，戰力之關於後方經濟，特別與生產力之關係，至大且互。而生產力結局，惟為人與物之相互積，如能總動員人與物之相乘積，如能總動員東亞十億民衆，歲量利用東亞所有資源，則共力量，極為偉大。中華民國，滿洲國，泰國，緬句國等，均負有後力兵站基地之任務。南方各地資源，刻正順利開發，以增强戰力，此種狀况，極可慶幸，至於政治建設，更有飛躍發展，即中華民國已於本年一月九日參戰，八月一日收囘上海租界，同時中國巳脫却次殖民地之地位，同時緬甸巳實行獨立，且對英美布吿參戰。印度納西亞民族，巳許其參輿政治。中日條約即將根據道義精神於最近改訂。非島　望之獨立，亦可於本年內實現。</p>
<p>英美徒屬空言</p>
<p>英美因受日本交還在華影響，乃不得不在形式，作毫無意義中的交還渝蔣，並通知撤廢治外法權，此種事實，足以證明英美巳屈服於我日本實力輿道義之前，然此舉亦僅為彼等權宜之措置，亦空頭支票而巳。東亞一叛徒之渝方，今後對常前之態勢，若不明暸，則其動搖，定必意趨深刻。今日中國革命之偉大事業，即取消不平等條約，行將完成，此係汪主席領導之國民政府所完成者，蔣介石領導之渝方，實不能得此。益以國民政府，已對我日本推進互助敦睦之經濟合作，共同防衛，溝通文化等政策，渝方則甘心以中國本土，供英美作對日作戰之戰塲，借英美之武器彈丸，使四億國胞流血，欲永淪束亞為英美之殖民地，使東亞民族，永為英美之奴隸，此為中國國民尤應認識者，應理解孰為忠實於東亞，並為中國之愛國者，猶憶孫中山先生曾在此間演講大亞細亞主義，現眞正續承孫先生遺敎之中國革命後輩，果為何人，此為中國國民所應覺悟者。蓋我日本自主之發展，旨在從英美壓迫榨取中解放大東亞，使萬邦各得其所，以謀大東亞之共存共榮，其共同建設，在謀大東亞之興隆，亦惟有完成此兩者，始為貫澈大東亞戰爭之眞正姿態。</p>
<h3 id="c3">倫敦太平洋會議　日方毫不重視 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>認其不能收獲實際效果</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電據此間權威人士觀察，本月四日，在倫敦召開之所謂太平洋會議，觀其出席人員，如英陸海空三軍代表，荷蘭亡命政府首相一，荷蘭艦隊司令及淪外長一宋子文等，可如其會議之目的，當為以對日總反攻為中心之太平洋作戰方　。另一方面，英方所有羅斯福邱吉爾史丹林或亦參加，舉行會談，協議對軸心作戰方策之流言，倘係事實，則此當為彼等對義大利政　及歐洲與太平洋戰局等問題演變，作過大估計而生之樂觀產物，當此戰局似稍有補於開戰當初慘敗之時，反軸心方面，即誇大事實，宣傳對軸心反攻，實亦不禁令人失笑。蓋英美與蘇聯，甚至英美之間，其戰爭目的，即各不相同，故以彼等之同床　夢，絕無合作可能，目鑒於歐洲方面，德國已　成共歐洲要塞，太平洋方而，日本已確立大東亞共榮　之基礎，以及繼緬甸之後，非律賓亦即將獨立、由此而築成之堅强陣容，縱戰局稍有波瀾軸心之最後勝利，固仍毫無問題，故此際反軸心方而無論主張歐洲太平洋同時作戰主義，或歐洲第一主　，或太平洋第一主義，其不能獲得實效，亦皆相同，現軸心方而，巳完成共一切防備，所謂攻勞的防衛，巳堅如磐石，無論東亞與歐洲，決稍無動搖之虞，故一都市一島嶼之得失，實無碍於大局，所謂太平洋會議，或三互的會議等，僅為虛張聲勢之會談，其後果將仍以亡命政府之陳情或泣訢而終結。</p>
<h3 id="c4">緬國防軍司令希孟　暢談今後建軍抱負　南斯拉夫承認緬甸獨立 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電一新任緬甸國防軍司令官希孟上校，於六日首次會見日記者團，暢談今後之拖負，披瀝以身計國之決意。據稱緬甸之獨立，唯有大東亞戰爭勝利始得確保，是以吾人唯一之目的，厥為協力日軍爭取戰爭之勝利，但增强國軍之數量，亦為常前急務，而培植富有愛圖心之精兵强将，更為急務中之急務，因此余計劃實施者第一為養成具有建國理想與富有畫忠報國堅志之軍隊，第二為傾全力教育訓練以不計地位盡俸而有刻苦耐勞精神之軍隊，共次緬甸將來將採取微兵制度，以達成國民皆兵之理想，但就目面之情勢以觀，尙缺乏幹部人才，且軍隊裝爾亦朱臻美善，故余認為在目前，仍以採取志願兵制度為宜。此外關於增强兵備，擴充空軍，及其他各種近代化軍隊事宜，乃將來重要之課　云。接希孟司令官，亦係輿溫桑少將同於大東亞戰爭將勃發時三十名血盟渡日團體中之一人，本年三十三歲。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電據怕爾格來德電，　何外長達金奴，前會將緬甸國獨立事，通知南期拉夫首相，頃南斯拉夫首相已於六日覆電，謂承認緬甸獨立，並撰輿緬甸正式開始國交。</p>
<p>泰外相　覲見日皇</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電泰國外相華德楊，本日十時，偕同外交部政務局長尼拉　汗，通商局長彼尼瓦特　克遜兩氏進宮，於鳳凰　，晋謁日天皇陛下致敬，日天皇陛下當對外相等，　與懇談。外相常即致謝，並拜聆天皇陛下慰　之詞，旋即自宮中退出。日舉行援印大會</p>
<p>日舉行　援印大會</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電印度獨立運動，自於聖雄甘地指導下，高呼建設印度人之印度而毅然蹶起以來，迄今已　一年，現印度國民軍已在江特拉鮑斯之統率下組成，準備開始行動，日本國民運動　體，目睹印度民衆如此鬥爭，決定發動一大援助運動。日大政　贊會，於七日特召開準備會，決定聯合興亞總本部，於九日下午一時半，假大東亞會　，召開援助印度獨立國民運動團體代表大會，聞屆時出席者有各國民述動團體代表等三百餘人。又該會價定今後將利用一切機會分在全國各地，展開此種運動，以援助印度獨立連動。</p>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　印度獨立聯盟緬甸地方委員會，除對汀特拉鮑斯氏抵緬表示熱烈歡迎外，並將以此為契機，集結在緬印人之總力，昻揚達成完全獨立之決意，以打倒英美起見，特於七月　日十九時，在此問舉行完成獨立印人民衆大會，誓以血肉獲得獨立　　日此問印人，及緬旬全國各地印度獨立聯盟支部代表三千餘人，均陸續於開會　到塲，開會後，於呼　印度國民歌中昇三色國旗。同時，全並並高呼「革命」「萬歲」等口號，一時歡呼之聲震撼天地，充分表現獨立之決意，為獨立聯盟緬甸地方委員會委員長蓋尼氏致開會　，繼之鮑斯氏於掌聲需動中登台講演表明狦立之決意，約歷一小時半，詞意怒擊，聆者莫不動容，迄十入時半始行散會。</p>
<p>印反英運動　益趨熾烈</p>
<p>伊斯坦布七日中央社電印度甘地翁尼赫魯及其他國民會議派各領袖，於去年入月九日晨，在孟買舉行大會時，均被捕入獄，同時各派系組織之指　者，亦相繼被檢舉，迄今一年於茲，彼等刻雖仍監禁於獄中，然其指導精神，則仍貫澈於印度民衆之間，於過去之一年問，曾迭次展間釋放指導者之運動及反英不服從運動，此外更因英國微收食糧，加重印人之武力彈壓，故使印人之反英悄緒日高，今印度民族運動益　熾烈，其範圍亦隨之擴大。英當局對印度之政情，雖有積　講求種種對策，然終無根本解決卞法，本年二月問，甘地翁之絕食抗爭，更引起世界人士之益大衝動，蓋此即為甘地欲求英國最後反省　採之手段。然英國毫　反省之意，英印事務相阿姆里甚更希望甘地病死　中，然彼則不知若甘地　果死於獄中，印度民衆果否仍能如是沉默耶。甘地翁及其他各領袖者迄現　仍不得釋放者，並非彼等於暴力前之失收，乃係英國之暴力將在印度不屈不　之意志　屈服，蓋英國今已陷於不知所措之狀態，現印度國內各派已均一致要求釋放甘地，此後各派如能眞　合作，結成反英統一戰綫，其目的並非絕對不可達成。最近江特拉鮑氏，於昭南創設自由印度國民軍，又新緬甸之與英國宣戰，凡此足證東亞各國均結成一體，支援印度獨立之實現云。</p>

<p>高田：刻苦生活的必要，這裏大體已經說得很多了。不過我還想補充幾句。我認為國家文化例如生產技術，或敎育，與衛生施設等項，也非竭力提高不可。因為刻苦之成為問題，完全在國民生活的衣食住方面，究竟要把國民生活減低到什麼程度呢？以前我們國民個人所負担的，如衛生醫藥或興趣敎養等等問題，如能都歸國家負担，那麽，所剩下的衣食住，我覺得很以减至現在的農民農生活水準。可是提高的農民生活，也不一定增加耕地。或提高生生產物的價格，使他們的收入豐富。如有必要國家得限制都會生活者的收入，並使他們負扣農民的全部敎育經費，或减免課稅。</p>
<p>戶田：據一般的觀察，農民吃的東西，非常粗糙，似乎榮養不起，然而實際上則不然，就在生理學上看來，食品粗糙，身體反可健康。靠近愛媛縣和高知縣縣境的海岸地方都是駿嶺深谷，那山谷上，除了白薯和　裏的沙丁魚以外，沒有其他的生產，但是這全地方却有一個稱為日本第一的兵隊吋」。</p>
<p>高田：九州地方也有同樣的本例。久留米的駐軍，多產精兵，其中長崎縣的島嶼所出的兵丁身體最健壯，這也是以白薯，沙了魚，栗類等等作為主要的食品。遼有岩手縣的深山裏，只有白薯，粟，稗，等等的生產，人們都用來當作全要食品，那裏的忖莊人，百分之百檢騐體格都是合格的。</p>
<p>戶田：歸納紀來這些粗糙食品都是榮養最良的證據，在都會　優游過活的人們，認為部會的菜飯，克分含着榮養，結局是一種談解罷了。</p>
<p>高田：市井蕭條的昧候，醫生與和尙，便要過着門可羅省特別寂寞的生活，這話雖是俗語，却含有深意，因為市井蕭條引起生活困難，於是死亡率因此增加，通常都是這麽推想吧，實際上完全相反，應該解釋為因市上不景氣，人們的收入因此減少，所以即使生病也沒有延醫的能力。但是還不能說明和尙寂寞的原由。不過我相信小景氣是對於人身的健康上並無妨害。現在不是不景氣的時候，却是為了戰爭時期各種物資不能自由，那情形到處皆同，不獨日本為然。但這種現實不是個良好的現象嗎？</p>
<p>戶田：明治世四年的时候從日本最初完成的統　，加以調查，每逢　年的第二年，死亡率減少，而出產率增加，豐年的第二年，恰是相反死亡率增加，而出產率也不見依比例增加。這大概在任何國家都有同樣的現象。……至於遺次的戰爭，如果成為長期戰鬥，那麽對於食品。恐怕也不能予取予求，萬事如意吧。要忍受持久的戰鬥，便應減少，食品的絕對需要分量，但絕對分量，不僅對於白米而言，無論著，稗，麥類，什麼都可以果腹。這是最關緊要的辦法。所以在凶年吃的都是組糧，身體因而得到榮養和健康，假如僅僅地吃白米和鹹菜，縱令每　吃了一升米的飯還是榮養不良。</p>
<p>高田：現在說到衣服方而，我認為很有減低的餘地。所謂刻苦生活者，是從我們的生活當中消滅，虛　的一種生活，但是衣服方面，我以為大部分是裝飾外表的東四。</p>
<p>戶田：您所說的「外表裝飾」究竟是什麽？</p>
<p>高田：例如要公司的總經理們、穿着開領觀衫和短褲，他們便說在體面上太不雅觀，委實難於照辦。他們所說的體而，就是我所說的「外表裝飾一了，又如木屐等足上穿着的東西。也毋須像現在這樣有幾百種之多。可是他們結要想出種種的花樣，定要翻新門巧，與衆不同的玩意兒，使別人來質識，所以就是本展一項，種類越出越多。至於衣服，也是裝飾外表的一部分，但其種類也多得可驚，參看生計調查的統計，例如月入一百元的生括，和月入二百的比較起來，膳食費都不相上下，不同的地方，就是衣服費和房租，那是因為交際和　究體面的緣故，至於吃飯問題，普通家庭大概用不着裝飾外表吧。</p>
<p>戶田：果然，說得很對，　在這四五年來，正在從事衣服的國勢調查，現在已經得到了五卞萬份的答案，正在開始調查。我覺得日本人身邊的衣服和坐墊等類部加算起來大致可値時價三百萬萬元，比歐洲人大概不足十分之一，但和中國人或滿洲人比較之下，當然是很多了。這第一是日本人沒有床，所以有墊隊的必要。還有大家庭　必用客坐的　　，客用的擊褥裏所用的棉花、算來要將近達到三萬萬貫（一　等於六·二五斤），這種數目實在可　，還有嫁裝的衣服，也是日木獨有的情形，這都是日本人身邊帶着衣物最多的理由之一。所以日本今後在十年開對衣物可說毫不着急了。</p>
<p>高田：住的方面，也有　多問題，很感困難，您覺得如何？</p>
<p>戶田：我認為在戰爭期問說到設築房屋，其根本觀念就鍇誤了。在和平的時候，建築一座結實的房子，是有必要的，但在戰爭期間，人們都集中到都會來，所以總得設法有居住的地方，這原是出於不得已，可是對於窗戶被璃，如値得仔細考慮。日本人覺得用玻璃窗戶，對面的人可以看見屋裏，還有不通空氣的缺點，成為增加肺　的原因之一，所以都主張仍舊使用紙格窗戶。或是外面再加一層木板的避雨窗。這樣，白天如果覺得黑暗，可以打聞，空襲的時候也很方便，那避雨窗就是關　，也可以流通空氣呢。</p>
<p>高田：我對於住的問題，也很考慮過一番。日本的家屋，因風土關係，濕氣很重的綵故，並且被空襲所破壞的時候，立刻便可重建，容易恢復的緣故，所以我以為木料建築的住宅，是最適宜了。</p>
<p>戶田：不，最好的房屋還是以磚砌的為合理、像日本這樣濕氣重的地方‘裏而還是要用木料裝飾。至於都會的住宅。無論從防空的　地出發，或　預防　衣服起見，都有淘汰的必要。（完）（新：譯白二十四日二十五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>報載　汪主席因公再度蒞滬，昨天下午特於百忙中偕同政府高級官吏招待本市各界人士茶會，席間隨意談話，始終充滿歡洽情緒。</p>
<p>據我們的歡測，這次茶會與其說「招待各界」，不如說「官民聯歡」，來得切當。官民聯歡，足以增進政府與人氏間的情感，隨意談話，足以演　　　與人民間的意見。更可從茶會席門來　對主席發生景仰與　戴之忱而證　。所以，這種聚會，是包含着政府與人民打成一片的意義。我們盼望從臨時的聯歡，進而擴以為一完善的民問襲贊機關。換旬話說，就是我們一向主張的民意機構。</p>
<p>說到民意機構，當世各國莫不具備並予重視，民意機　愈健全，人民與政府愈團結，也就是國家愈强盛。各先進國不必說，就是新獨立的緬旬，也先成立代表民意的建國議會；爪哇原住民也設置中央及地方參議院，傳達民意。我們國府還都三年餘了，目前地位已是建設大東亞共榮圈重要的一員，為了官民協力復興建國完成勝利，更需要上自中央下至地方報織健全的民意機構。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Weekly Commentary: On the Internal Discord Between Chongqing and the Communists <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Song Xuan</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have been abuzz with news of friction between Chongqing and the Communists, even reaching the stage of open conflict. We have not paid much attention to this kind of news, because the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists is just like the relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union—contradictions and conflicts are natural phenomena and nothing to be surprised about. We should not pay excessive attention to the Chongqing-Communist conflict, even exaggerating the matter, and neglect our own current endeavors. However, as the world war situation becomes increasingly severe, and the movements of East Asian countries become increasingly important in the decisive battle, the news we have received from various sources completely proves that the friction and conflict between Chongqing and the Communists has reached the point of civil war. Therefore, the consequences of this event's evolution should no longer be treated with a reserved attitude and should be closely watched.</p>
<p>The renewed war between Chongqing and the Communists was long anticipated by those in the know. The main reason is that although both sides temporarily ceased fighting under the slogans of "Resistance and National Construction" and "United Front," they both understood that these were merely beautiful slogans used to maintain and expand their power. Therefore, from leaders to cadres, both sides were on guard against each other. Although they said they had ceased fighting, they had not cooperated. Not only had they not cooperated, but the cessation of fighting was also superficial. The Pingjiang Massacre of the 19th year, the wars between new and old armies, and the Southern Anhui Incident of the 30th year, etc., have fully revealed the crisis of renewed war between Chongqing and the Communists. The reason why it did not escalate from local to full-scale was due to: first, the restraint of the international forces of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union; second, the mediation of neutral parties and political groups between Chongqing and the Communists; third, the conspiracy of the Chinese Communists, who constantly expressed forbearance and concession (although only superficially); and fourth, the Chongqing side's preparations were not yet complete. However, since the Greater East Asia War, the situation has changed greatly, and the conflict between Chongqing and the Communists has gradually moved towards a full-scale war stage.</p>
<p>Why have the events of the past one year and eight months of the Greater East Asia War promoted the contradiction between Chongqing and the Communists? From the international perspective, the power of Britain and America in East Asia began to collapse, so their voice towards Chongqing and especially towards the anti-communist faction of Chongqing was considerably limited. In order to induce Chongqing to cooperate in the war against Burma and India and to strengthen the British and American right to station troops in the Southwest, Britain and America showed considerable concessions on the Northwest issue. Secondly, the Soviet Union, in order to fully resist Germany, was also unable to look eastward. These are the international factors for the rise of the anti-communist faction in Chongqing. From the perspective of the domestic situation, due to the interruption of the Southeast smuggling routes, the destruction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the loss of Burma, and the collapse of southern Yunnan, the Chongqing regime's territory began to shake. In order to make a final struggle, the Chongqing regime actively adopted a policy of strengthening "central centralization" and "centralizing" the Northwest. The superficial submission of Xinjiang further encouraged Chongqing and Chiang Kai-shek's determination to use force against the Communists. From the perspective of the development of the peace zone, since the Greater East Asia War, the implementation of Japan's new policy toward China and the changes in all phenomena in the peace zone have begun to make the Chongqing regime and the people under its jurisdiction lose confidence in the future of the "War of Resistance." Therefore, the Chongqing regime has a new crisis of disintegration. As a result, Chongqing and Chiang planned to oppose the Communists. On the one hand, they completely blamed the complete failure of the "War of Resistance" on the Chinese Communist Party's sabotage conspiracy, and on the other hand, they used the anti-communist war to save and boost morale.</p>
<p>Why did Wei begin preparing for a full-scale anti-communist campaign now? There are three immediate reasons. First, due to the complete failure of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen's diplomatic activities in the United States. Originally, during the Luo-Qiu Washington talks, the two Soongs attempted to participate as representatives of "one of the four powers," attempting to change Churchill's strategy of attacking Hitler first and realizing a counterattack in the Pacific first. At that time, both Chongqing and Australia were very active. However, as a result, Chongqing and Australia's dreams completely failed. Soong Tzu-wen quickly went to England, Soong Mei-ling returned to Chongqing in embarrassment, and the anti-communist movement was made public. Second, due to the wavering of the Chongqing generals. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing generals, in view of the trend of the times, have wavered, abandoned the War of Resistance, surrendered to He Yun, and dedicated themselves to participating in the Greater East Asia War. Affected by this, most of the Chongqing military generals are in danger of wavering. Therefore, they had to launch an anti-communist war in an attempt to save their final fate. Third, it was due to the dissolution of the Third International. Zhang Difei took the opportunity to advocate dissolving the Chinese Communist Party, abolishing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and disarming the Eighteenth Group Army.</p>
<p>At present, the Chongqing-Communist war is only a series of local battles. Therefore, it is not yet time to make inferences or conclusions today. At present, the Chongqing side is using Chiang Kai-shek's book "China's Destiny" as a guide, attempting to win over people's hearts on the one hand, and launching an anti-communist movement ideologically and theoretically on the other hand. All the Chongqing-controlled puppet organizations and cultural groups, academic groups, etc., have sent telegrams to Mao Zedong, urging him to immediately dissolve the Communist Party, abolish the border area and disarm the Eighteenth Group Army. All these arrangements by the Chongqing side are naturally the prelude to a large-scale anti-communist war, and are exactly the same as the methods used by Chongqing and Chiang in the past to deal with the communist opposition. As for the Communist side, although in the border area and other places, they are also gearing up for action and are ready to launch, in reality, the Chinese Communist military has encountered a severe defeat by the Japanese army in North China, with heavy casualties, outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are still desperately shouting for "political solution" and "opposing civil war." Regarding the Chongqing-Communist war, some people in the peace zone have made premature optimistic remarks, which we believe should not be the case. Because, first, the CCP's political conspiracy is still actively moving, and this activity has penetrated deeply into the Chongqing army. Frankly speaking, the Chongqing army's military strength today is not much different from the Northeast Army during the Xi'an Incident, and its combat effectiveness cannot be overestimated. Second, the Chongqing side's anti-communism, in fact, is just like the Chinese Communist Party's "anti-war," just a slogan to maintain its regime. "Resistance" is all hypocrisy, and today's "anti-communism" and "anti-war" are also hypocrisy. The Chongqing side's anti-communism without cooperating with Japan will never succeed. Standing on the position of the Chinese people, we naturally cannot bear to see the compatriots in the Northwest being ravaged and slaughtered again in the Chongqing-Communist internal strife. Therefore, we hope that people with knowledge and ambition in Chongqing and the Communist Party will make a major decision and come to the peace zone. At the same time, we hope that the national government and friendly Japan will launch a political offensive to quickly subvert the Chongqing-Communist regime and realize comprehensive peace and the true unity of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Minister Hagiya of the Japanese Press Department's Speech: The Purpose of the Greater East Asia War is for Japan to Liberate Each Nation of East Asia and Enable Each to Attain Its Place and Achieve Co-existence and Co-prosperity <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Major General Hagiya, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army, delivered a speech at 5:00 PM on the 7th at the Kobe Municipal First Higher Girls' School, entitled "The Character and Development of the Greater East Asia War." The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: The Greater East Asia War is a righteous war for Japan to complete the traditional mission of the Imperial Country. I will briefly describe my views on the defensive and constructive nature of the Greater East Asia War and its development. First, the so-called defensive war is best expressed by the process of negotiations between Japan and the United States before the Greater East Asia War. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, once said, "Without Japan, there would be no East Asia," but Britain and the United States attempted to suppress Japan to achieve their ambition of dominating East Asia. Their ambition began after the Russo-Japanese War, and became even more blatant after the First World War. After the September 18th Incident, it became even more radical, and during the Sino-Japanese War, they openly supported Chiang Kai-shek, fueling the chaos in East Asia, and colluded with Britain to form a so-called anti-Japanese encirclement, using economic sanctions to strengthen the threat to Japan's survival. After several peaceful negotiations, they ultimately failed. Japan rose up in self-defense. Looking at the current situation, the enemy is encircling Japan from the front, waiting for an opportunity to take large-scale and controlled military actions to force the Japanese mainland. Japan can be said to be preparing for the next major counterattack during a period of quiet. Second, in terms of the nature of the construction war, the fundamental thought of Japan is that:</p>
<p>The guiding ideology of Japan's construction of a new East Asia is to realize the great ideal of "Hakko Ichiu" (all the world under one roof), so that each nation can attain its place and all people can live in peace and prosperity. This great ideal is currently being realized step by step in Greater East Asia. For example, the oppressed people in the South have recognized the meaning of this war and are enthusiastically cooperating. This is a clear sign of the progress of ideological construction. Looking at economic construction, this war is clearly a war of attrition. The relationship between war power and the rear economy, especially the relationship with productivity, is extremely important and interdependent. The ultimate goal of productivity is the mutual accumulation of people and things. If we can fully mobilize the 1 billion people of East Asia and make full use of all the resources of East Asia, then its power will be extremely great. The Republic of China, Manchuria, Thailand, and Burma all have the task of being rear-force supply base. The resources of various places in the South are being successfully developed to enhance war power, and this situation is extremely gratifying. As for political construction, there has been even more rapid development. The Republic of China has already joined the war on January 9 this year, and recovered the Shanghai concessions on August 1. At the same time, China has shaken off its status as a semi-colony. At the same time, Burma has implemented independence and announced its participation in the war against Britain and the United States. The people of Indonesia have been allowed to participate in politics. The Sino-Japanese Treaty will be revised soon based on the spirit of morality. The independence of the Philippines is also expected to be realized this year.</p>
<p>Empty Promises from Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Britain and the United States, influenced by Japan's return of rights in China, had no choice but to formally and meaninglessly return them to Chongqing and notify them of the abolition of extraterritorial rights. This fact is enough to prove that Britain and the United States have succumbed to Japan's strength and morality. However, this move is only an expedient measure for them, and is also an empty promise. If the Chongqing side, a traitor of East Asia, does not understand the current situation, its wavering will definitely become more profound. The great cause of the Chinese revolution today is to abolish unequal treaties, which is about to be completed. This was completed by the National Government led by President Wang Jingwei. The Chongqing side led by Chiang Kai-shek cannot obtain this. Furthermore, the National Government has been promoting mutually beneficial economic cooperation, joint defense, and cultural exchange policies with Japan. The Chongqing side is willing to provide Chinese territory to Britain and the United States as a battlefield for war against Japan, and use British and American weapons and ammunition to shed the blood of 400 million compatriots, wanting to permanently turn East Asia into a colony of Britain and the United States, and make the East Asian people slaves of Britain and the United States forever. This is what the Chinese people should recognize, and should understand who is loyal to East Asia and is a patriot of China. I still remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen giving a speech here on Pan-Asianism. Now, who are the true successors of Dr. Sun's teachings and the younger generations of the Chinese revolution? This is what the Chinese people should be aware of. Japan's independent development aims to liberate Greater East Asia from the oppression and exploitation of Britain and the United States, so that all nations can attain their place and seek co-existence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. Their joint construction is to seek the prosperity of Greater East Asia. Only by completing these two can the true posture of the Greater East Asia War be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Side Does Not Value the London Pacific Conference At All <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Believing That It Cannot Achieve Practical Results</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to observations by authoritative sources here, the purpose of the so-called Pacific Conference held in London on the 4th of this month, judging from the attendees such as representatives of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Prime Minister of the Dutch government in exile, the Commander of the Dutch Fleet, and Foreign Minister Soong Tzu-wen, should be to focus on a total counteroffensive against Japan in the Pacific War. On the other hand, there are rumors that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin from the British side may also participate and hold talks to discuss strategies for the war against the Axis powers. If this is true, it is the result of an overestimation of the evolution of the Italian political situation and the European and Pacific war situations, which is an optimistic product. Now that the war situation seems to be slightly better than the initial disastrous defeat, the anti-Axis side is exaggerating the facts and publicizing the counteroffensive against the Axis powers, which is really laughable. Because the war aims of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, and even between Britain and the United States, are different. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of cooperation with their shared bed and separate dreams. Seeing that Germany has built a strong European fortress in Europe, and Japan has established the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the Pacific, and that the Philippines will soon become independent after Burma, the firm lineup built by this will ensure that the final victory of the Axis powers remains unquestionable, even if the war situation has some ups and downs. Therefore, at this time, it is the same for the anti-Axis side to advocate simultaneous European-Pacific war doctrine, or European-first doctrine, or Pacific-first doctrine, and they cannot achieve practical results. At present, the Axis side has completed all its defenses, and the so-called offensive defense is as solid as a rock. Whether it is in East Asia or Europe, there is no need to worry about any wavering. Therefore, the gain or loss of a city or an island does not hinder the overall situation. The so-called Pacific Conference or tripartite conference, etc., are just conferences to create an impression, and their consequences will still end with the petitions or pleas of the government in exile.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Burmese Defense Army Commander Hsi Meng Speaks Freely About His Ambitions for Building the Army in the Future. Yugoslavia Recognizes Burmese Independence <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Yangon, 7th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Commander of the Burmese Defense Army, Colonel Hsi Meng, met with a group of Japanese reporters for the first time on the 6th and spoke freely about his burdens in the future, expressing his determination to serve the country with his life. It is said that the independence of Burma can only be ensured with the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our only goal is to cooperate with the Japanese army to win the victory of the war. However, increasing the number of the national army is also an urgent task at hand, and cultivating elite soldiers and strong generals with patriotic hearts is even more urgent. Therefore, what I plan to implement is: first, to cultivate an army with national ideals and a firm determination to serve the country loyally; second, to devote all our efforts to education and training, so that the army is not concerned with position, does its duty, and has the spirit of enduring hardship and hard work. Furthermore, Burma will adopt a conscription system in the future to achieve the ideal of all people being soldiers. However, judging from the current situation, there is a lack of cadre talents, and the equipment of the army is not yet complete. Therefore, I believe that at present, it is still appropriate to adopt a volunteer system. In addition, increasing military preparations, expanding the air force, and other various modern army matters will be important tasks in the future. Commander Hsi Meng is also one of the thirty members of the blood oath group who went to Japan with General Win San when the Greater East Asia War was about to break out. He is 33 years old this year.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Belgrade, Foreign Minister Dacinović previously notified the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia about the independence of Burma. The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia replied by telegram on the 6th, stating that he recognized the independence of Burma and would formally begin diplomatic relations with Burma.</p>
<p>Thai Foreign Minister Pays Homage to the Japanese Emperor</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Thai Foreign Minister Watthayakorn, accompanied by Nilarat Khan, Director-General of the Political Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Phinitwatthana Ketson, Director-General of the Department of Commerce, entered the palace at 10:00 today to pay homage to the Japanese Emperor at the Phoenix Hall. The Japanese Emperor had cordial talks with the Foreign Minister and others. The Foreign Minister immediately expressed his gratitude and listened to the words of comfort from the Emperor, and then withdrew from the palace. Japan Holds Rally to Support India</p>
<p>Japan Holds Rally to Support India</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the Indian independence movement, under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi, resolutely rose up, calling for the construction of an India for Indians, it has been a year now. The Indian National Army has been formed under the leadership of Jiang Tela Bose and is preparing to take action. The Japanese National Movement Organization, seeing the struggle of the Indian people, decided to launch a major aid movement. The Japanese Taisei Yokusankai specially convened a preparatory meeting on the 7th and decided to jointly convene the General Headquarters of the Rising Asia at the Greater East Asia Hall at 1:30 pm on the 9th to hold a rally of representatives of national movements to aid Indian independence. It is heard that more than 300 people, including representatives of various national narrative groups, will attend at that time. The association has also priced to use all opportunities in the future to launch this movement in various parts of the country to aid the Indian independent movement.</p>
<p>Yangon, 7th (Central News Agency) - In addition to expressing a warm welcome to Ting Tella Bose's arrival in Burma, the Burma Regional Committee of the Indian Independence League will take this opportunity to gather the total power of the Indians in Burma and raise the determination to achieve complete independence. In order to defeat Britain and the United States, a mass rally of the Indian people to achieve independence was specially held here at 19:00 on July 7th. At this question, there were more than 3,000 people, including Indian people, and representatives of the Indian Independence League branches in Burma, who arrived at the meeting in succession. After the meeting, the three-color national flag was raised in the Indian national song. At the same time, the whole also shouted slogans such as "Revolution" and "Long Live," and the cheers shook the world, fully expressing the determination to be independent. Ganee, Chairman of the Burma Regional Committee of the Independence League, made an opening statement, followed by Bose, who took the stage in the midst of applause to express his determination to stand up for the sake of revolution for about an hour and a half. Those who listened were deeply moved, and the meeting was dismissed until 10:30.</p>
<p>The Indian Anti-British Movement is Becoming More Fierce</p>
<p>Istanbul, 7th (Central News Agency) - Gandhi Ong Nehru and other leaders of the National Congress Party were arrested and imprisoned on the morning of September 9 last year when they held a conference in Mumbai. At the same time, the fingers of various faction organizations were also successively reported. One year has passed since then, and although they are still imprisoned, their guiding spirit still permeates the Indian people. In the past year, there have been repeated movements to release the leaders and anti-British disobedience movements. In addition, the British have taken food and intensified the military suppression of the Indians, which has made the anti-British sentiments of the Indians increasingly high. Now the Indian national movement is becoming more and more fierce, and its scope is also expanding. Although the British authorities have been actively seeking various countermeasures for the political situation in India, there is still no fundamental solution. In February this year, Gandhi Ong's hunger strike aroused even greater impulse among people around the world. This is the means by which Gandhi sought the last reflection of Britain. However, Britain did not reflect at all, and the British Indian Affairs Minister Amrish even hoped that Gandhi would die of illness in prison. However, he did not know whether the Indian people could still remain silent if Gandhi did die in prison. The fact that Gandhi Ong and other leaders have not been released to this day is not because they have lost to violence, but because British violence is about to subjugate the unyielding will in India. Britain is now in a state of confusion. The various factions in India have now unanimously demanded the release of Gandhi. If the various factions can truly cooperate in the future and form a united anti-British front, their goal is not absolutely unattainable. Recently, Jiang Tela Bose established the Free Indian National Army in Zhao Nan, and New Burma declared war with Britain. All this proves that the countries of East Asia have formed a united body to support the realization of Indian independence.</p>

<p>Goebbels' Speech Encourages the Germans to Endure</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a report from the News Agency, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a recent article discussing the current situation, stated that the progress of the air war has undergone a fundamental change. The current air raid experienced by the Germans is a powerful test, the same as the one the British experienced in 1940. The British government at that time decided to work hard to develop its weapons in order to change the situation of the air war, and now we are also making the same effort. However, the nature of this preparation and the date of its implementation cannot be disclosed in advance, but retaliation measures have already been prepared. Minister Guo specially emphasized that the battles of the past few weeks have reached a decisive form. In the last war, German women and children surrendered due to the pressure of hunger. The current airborne terror action also wants to achieve the same goal. The German Air Force's air raid in 1940 was limited to military targets, but today the enemy's air raid is concentrated on the German people. The British do not deny this. Although we cannot now make a group air raid as a powerful retaliation, the method of defense has achieved its purpose. Because the air defense facilities have now been strengthened, the losses suffered by the enemy are also increasing. Guo Zhixian had a theory on the issue of civilian defense, saying that complete evacuation is impossible, but useless women and children can be evacuated from Berlin, because they will become the target of air raids. The British claim that continuing to carry out this kind of action will cause a crisis in Germany. This kind of fantasy has no possibility of realization. The people should give active cooperation to the government's plan, and all the difficulties caused are transitional in nature. The anti-Axis countries' attacks on the Southeast and South Lines will have a certain time limit and cannot be maintained for a long time. Guo declared in his conclusion that the decision of the current war should be to invigorate the people's sentiments. The British often praise the endurance of their people. Today, the enemy will feel the resolute will to fight to protect our freedom and life.</p>

The Italian side hoped for Germany's full support in continuing the war, and Germany also stated that it would not borrow any difficulties and would give Italy the greatest assistance. As a result, Italy's policy of continuing the war has become more firm, and all agreements are proceeding in an extremely satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Berlin, July 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the German News Agency's frontline correspondent, Mr. Xiaoleigna, the situation on Sicily is as follows: The anti-Axis forces on the central Sicilian front launched a new offensive on the 5th in the Nicosia area, mainly composed of Canadian troops with a small detachment of South American forces, to attack the Axis positions in the area. The Axis forces counterattacked and pushed them back. American tanks also participated in the battle, but their performance was poor, indicating that the enemy had suffered heavy losses in the fierce fighting over the past three days. German buffer units in the areas of Jaddabott and Paterno are continuing to inflict considerable damage on the anti-Axis forces. The German mountain troops are putting up particularly fierce resistance. The British Eighth Army in the Catania area remains inactive and has not yet advanced north of Catania.</p>

<p>Berlin, July 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency, the main objective of the Soviet offensive has shifted to the Belgorod area, where fierce fighting is currently underway. The eastern front area has expanded dramatically. The shift in the center of operations, resulting in initial small victories for the Soviet army, was expected and has no impact on the overall situation. The Soviet army has now entered Belgorod and is still engaged in street fighting. German reserve troops have arrived to assist in the battle. The Soviet army is focused on Kharkov and has been concentrating forces southeast of Kharkov in recent days, seemingly preparing for a major offensive. The elite enemy forces attacking southeast of Orel have suffered heavy losses and have not succeeded. The Eastern Front summer campaign has lasted for a month. Considering the enemy's losses in manpower and material resources compared to the rapid advance of the German army last summer, there has been no significant victory. Last year, the German daredevils reached Voronezh in seven days and stormed into Rostov in three weeks. This year, the Soviet counteroffensive has lasted for a month and has only achieved small victories in Orel and Belgorod. In Orel, the Soviet gains are only twelve kilometers, and in Belgorod, the Soviet gains are only thirty-four square li. However, we must not overlook the fact that the Soviet large-scale counteroffensive is still underway. It is difficult to predict when the German army will be able to stop it, but after the great victory of the German counteroffensive on July 5th, the Soviet advance has slowed down significantly, due to heavy losses in manpower and material resources.</p>

<p>Takada: We've discussed the necessity of a frugal life quite a bit. However, I'd like to add a few more points. I believe that national culture, such as production technology, education, and sanitation facilities, must also be vigorously improved. Because frugality as an issue is entirely about the people's food, clothing, and housing, to what extent should we reduce the people's living standards? In the past, issues that individuals shouldered, such as healthcare, medicine, or hobbies and education, could all be borne by the state. Then, for the remaining food, clothing, and housing, I think it could be reduced to the living standards of farmers today. However, improving farmers' lives doesn't necessarily mean increasing arable land or raising the prices of agricultural products to enrich their income. If necessary, the state should limit the income of urban residents and make them bear the full educational expenses of farmers or reduce or exempt taxes.</p>
<p>Toda: From a general observation, the food that farmers eat is very coarse and doesn't seem nutritious, but in reality, that's not the case. From a physiological point of view, coarse food can actually be healthier for the body. The coastal areas near the border between Ehime and Kochi prefectures are all steep mountains and deep valleys. Besides sweet potatoes and sardines from the valley, there is no other production, but this whole area has what is called the "best soldiers in Japan."</p>
<p>Takada: There are similar examples in the Kyushu region. The garrison in Kurume produces many elite soldiers, and the soldiers from the islands of Nagasaki Prefecture are the strongest. They also mainly eat sweet potatoes, sardines, chestnuts, and so on. In the deep mountains of Iwate Prefecture, there are only sweet potatoes, millet, barnyard millet, and so on, which people use as their main food. The villagers there all pass the physical examination at a 100% rate.</p>
<p>Toda: In summary, these coarse foods are evidence of the best nutrition. People who live comfortably in the cities think that the food in the urban areas contains nutrition, but that's just nonsense.</p>
<p>Takada: In times of economic recession, doctors and monks have to live a particularly lonely life, as the saying goes. This is a deep meaning, because people usually assume that economic recession leads to living difficulties, thus increasing the mortality rate. In reality, it's the opposite. It should be explained as that because of the economic downturn, people's income decreases, so they don't have the ability to seek medical attention even when they are sick. However, this still cannot explain why monks are lonely. But I believe that a small recession is not harmful to human health. Now is not a time of recession, but a time when various supplies cannot be freely obtained due to the war. This situation is the same everywhere, not only in Japan. But isn't this reality a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>Toda: When Japan first completed the statistics in 1874, the mortality rate decreased and the birth rate increased in the second year after a good harvest. The second year after a bountiful year was exactly the opposite: the mortality rate increased and the birth rate did not increase proportionally. This probably happens in any country... As for this war, if it becomes a long-term battle, then we probably won't be able to get all the food we want. To endure a prolonged battle, we should reduce the absolute required amount of food, but the absolute amount doesn't only refer to rice. Millet, wheat, anything can fill the stomach. This is the most important thing to do. So in famine years, people eat coarse grains, and their bodies get nutrition and health. If you only eat white rice and pickles, even if you eat a bowl of rice every day, you will still be malnourished.</p>
<p>Takada: Now, talking about clothing, I think there is a lot of room for reduction. People who live frugally eliminate a kind of false life from our lives, but in terms of clothing, I think most of it is about decorating the appearance.</p>
<p>Toda: What exactly is "decorating the appearance" that you're talking about?</p>
<p>Takada: For example, if you ask company managers to wear open-collar shirts and shorts, they would say that it's too unsightly and difficult to do. The "decency" they're talking about is what I call "decorating the appearance." Also, things worn on the feet, like clogs, don't need to have hundreds of varieties like they do now. But they keep thinking of all kinds of patterns, and they have to come up with new and different tricks to make others recognize them. So even with just one item, the number of varieties increases. As for clothing, it's also part of decorating the appearance, but the number of varieties is also surprisingly large. Looking at the statistics of the living expense surveys, for example, when comparing a monthly income of 100 yuan and a monthly income of 200 yuan, the food expenses are about the same. The differences are in clothing expenses and rent, which is because of social interaction and pursuing decency. As for eating, ordinary families probably don't need to decorate their appearance.</p>
<p>Toda: Indeed, that's very true. For the past four or five years, I have been conducting a national survey of clothing. I have already received 50,000 responses and am starting to investigate. I think the total value of the clothes and cushions around Japanese people is about 3 million yuan at current prices, which is probably less than one-tenth of what Europeans have, but of course, it's a lot more compared to Chinese or Manchurians. The first reason is that Japanese people don't have beds, so they need cushions. Also, large families must have guest seats, and the cotton used in guest mattresses is close to 300 million guan (one guan is equal to 6.25 kilograms). This number is really frightening. Also, the clothes for the dowry are a unique situation in Japan. These are all reasons why Japanese people have the most clothing around them. So Japan doesn't have to worry about clothing for the next decade.</p>
<p>Takada: There are also many problems with housing, which I find very difficult. What do you think?</p>
<p>Toda: I think the fundamental concept is wrong when talking about building houses during wartime. In peacetime, it is necessary to build a strong house, but during wartime, people are concentrated in cities, so we have to find a place to live. This is originally out of necessity, but the glass for the windows is worth considering carefully. Japanese people feel that if they use glass windows, people on the other side can see inside the house, and the lack of ventilation is one of the reasons for increasing lung disease, so they all advocate still using paper windows or adding another layer of wooden rain-proof windows on the outside. This way, if it feels dark during the day, you can open them, and it's also convenient during air raids. The rain-proof window can also be used to close and circulate the air.</p>
<p>Takada: I've also considered the housing problem a lot. Because of the climate in Japan, the humidity is very heavy, and the houses can be rebuilt quickly and easily restored after being destroyed by air raids, so I think wooden houses are the most suitable.</p>
<p>Toda: No, the best houses are still those made of brick. In humid places like Japan, the inside still needs to be decorated with wood. As for urban housing, whether from the perspective of air defense or to prevent clothes from getting damaged, there is a need to eliminate them.

<p>The rice flour distribution offices originally planned to issue manifests on the 5th of this month, designating more than 660 rice shops in the First and Eighth Districts to pick up the rice from the Xingye Warehouse. However, because the United Cooperative failed to submit the warehouse manifests, the rice shops were unable to pick up the rice.

The shortage was borrowed from other related parties by the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee. Therefore, judging from the amount of rice supplied by the United Cooperative last month, it is still considered insufficient.

<p>Judicial Inspectors Dispatched to Local Court to Take on Night Duty</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the former Second Special District Court into the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, due to the expansion of its jurisdiction, the number of judicial police officers maintaining order in the court also needs to be increased. Therefore, the judicial police officers escorting prisoners have been organized into the "Judicial Administration Department Shanghai Judicial Police Team." The Chief Prosecutor, Mr. Chen Bingjun, serves as the team leader, with Mr. Weng Jian as the deputy team leader. The entire team has nearly one hundred members. The court clerks and security guards of the former Third and Second Special Courts have all been organized into judicial police team members, and the judicial police officers of the former Law Enforcement Room have also been merged in. It is reported that the shortfall will be publicly recruited from outside. The corpse inspection office at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall on Jiaozhou Road has also been dispatched by the Prosecutor's Office to send prosecutors to conduct corpse inspections. The Judicial Police Office of the former First Special Court has been abolished. Currently, two judicial inspectors are dispatched by the District Prosecutor's Office, leading ten judicial police officers, stationed in the First Local Court, to take on night duty and various duties that should be performed by the judicial police.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Concrete Measures to Prevent Salt Merchants from Raising Prices <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent merchants from hoarding, raising prices, or refusing to sell salt, the local salt administration authorities have formulated concrete measures, a few of which are excerpted below: Retail sales at storefronts are limited to those holding municipal residence permits or citizen identification cards. Salt shops and distilleries must bring their business licenses for salt shops when claiming salt. Those with an authorized sales quota of less than 20 *dan* will be temporarily allocated 1 *dan* each time; those with 21 to 50 *dan* will be allocated 2 *dan*; and those with more than 51 *dan* will be allocated 3 *dan*. After the salt is sold, they can continue to claim sales based on their account books (the intention is to prevent wholesale sales and eliminate hoarding). The salt administration authorities will consider increasing quotas for the usual supply. Salt shops and distilleries that retail salt must set up separate sales ledgers for inspection. In addition to informing the police for joint enforcement against illegal business practices that disrupt the people's food supply, the salt administration authorities also hope that all sectors of society will report such activities as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Building Shanghai <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Last night, Director of Works Zhang Enguan broadcasted a talk on "Shanghai Construction After Recovering the Concessions." Excerpts: Speaking of Shanghai's construction projects, there are countless things to do. Shanghai is China's leading commercial port, and trade with foreign countries is increasing daily. Larger tonnage ships cannot directly enter the Huangpu River and must berth outside the Wusongkou. The Hongjiang Wharf, which was planned and built by the former municipal authorities, has not been completed and was suspended due to [various] reasons. The uncompleted project should be considered for continued construction. Planned projects, such as dredging the Huangpu River to facilitate navigation, should proceed. Regarding the construction of the city center, we should continue to follow the wishes of the authorities and continue to proceed with the relocation of some citizens to achieve balanced development. As for Shanghai's roads and ditches, they are often flooded during storms or high tides, and the water does not recede. Therefore, the system of roads and ditches must be gradually rectified and reorganized.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Insurance Bureau Regulations: Types of Labor Insurance <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since the Social Simple Insurance Bureau implemented mandatory labor insurance, more than half of the major factories in the city have participated. However, some small factories have been using the excuse that they have fewer than thirty workers to apply for exemption, which is inconsistent with the original intention of promoting mandatory labor insurance. The outline of social simple insurance promulgated by the bureau stipulates that, in addition to factories subject to the Factory Law, employers engaged in hazardous or unsanitary work should apply for insurance for their employees. The bureau's medical committee has determined that all relevant factories or workshops, regardless of the number of employees, are subject to mandatory insurance. The types are as follows: Various workers at risk of occupational diseases and industrial poisoning: 1. Soap factory workers, 2. Oil factory workers, 3. Soap making workers, 4.

<p>Chairman Wang hosted a tea party for people from all walks of life in the city at the Caihui restaurant on the fourth floor of the International Hotel yesterday (the 7th) at 4 p.m. Chairman Wang, wearing a new National Etiquette uniform, looked radiant. Mayor Chen and others accompanied him to greet the guests. After Chairman Wang arrived, the attendees stepped forward to pay their respects. Chairman Wang greeted them one by one in a very pleasant manner. Those present included government officials President Wen Zongyao, President Liang Hongzhi, Vice President Zhou Fohai, Secretary-General Chen Chuntuan, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Lin Baisheng, Minister Ding Mocun, Minister Luo Junqiang, Minister Chen Junhui, National Government Commissioners Cen Ju’guang, Military Affairs Commissioner Chen Changshe, Ambassador to Manchukuo Chen Jicheng, Ambassador Wu Song, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, and Zhou Longxiang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Secretary-General Zhao Yue of the Municipal Government, heads of various bureaus and departments, and guests Wen Lantao, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, Ye Fuxiao, Tang Shoumin, Li Sihao, Xu Yusheng, Xu Xiaochu, Guo Shun, Zhao Jinqing, Jin Zongcheng, Zhu Rutang, Zhou Bangjun, Xiang Kangyi, Zhi Haibo, Chen Shuilu, Li Quanshi, Bao Guochang, Tang Xinghai, Wang Shuchang, Gu Nanqun, Li Zufan, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Bin’yu, Feng Jie, Zhou Huarong, Liu Haisu, Yang Guangzheng, Zhao Zhengping, Shen Siliang, and Zhou Yueran, Qiu Yunduo, Tao Kangde, Lu Feng, Liu Yusheng, Guan Lu, and others, more than two hundred people in total, who were about to go to Japan to attend the Conference of Scholars. They gathered together in a lively atmosphere. Chairman Wang and Mr. Zhang Yipeng were classmates at Tokyo in Japan more than thirty years ago.

<h3 id="e37">Visiting the Summer Training Camp to Explain the Outline of the New National Movement <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang is extremely concerned about this year’s summer training camp for civil servants and young people. Yesterday (the 7th) at 9 a.m., accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu, Central Committee Member Chen, and others, he personally visited the summer training camp for civil servants and young people again. The two camp commanders, Chen and Lin, and the heads of various departments and instructors led all the trainees to line up at the gate to welcome him. The Chairman, wearing his Grand Marshal uniform, slowly stepped out of the car amidst the melodious music of the city police band and walked into the Chairman's office, where he met with the two camp commanders. After inquiring about camp affairs, he was escorted by the two camp commanders, Chen and Lin, to the auditorium, where he took the stage to give a speech. He explained the "Outline of the New National Movement" in great detail, which deeply moved all the trainees. The speech lasted for more than an hour, after which the trainees shouted "Long live the leader!"</p>
<h3 id="e38">Brief Commentary: Official-Civilian Interaction and Communication of Public Opinion <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, Chairman Wang visited Shanghai again on official business. Yesterday afternoon, despite his busy schedule, he and senior government officials hosted a tea party for people from all walks of life in the city. The atmosphere was filled with joy and harmony throughout.</p>
<p>In our humble opinion, this tea party was more accurately described as an "official-civilian interaction" rather than simply "hosting various circles." Official-civilian interaction can enhance the relationship between the government and the people. Informal conversations can facilitate the exchange of opinions between officials and the public. The admiration and support expressed by the attendees towards Chairman Wang at the tea party further demonstrate this point. Therefore, such gatherings embody the significance of the government and the people coming together as one. We hope that temporary interactions can evolve into a comprehensive mechanism for gathering public input. In other words, we are advocating for the establishment of a formal public opinion institution.</p>
<p>Speaking of public opinion institutions, almost all countries in the world today have them and attach great importance to them. The more健全 the public opinion mechanism, the more united the people and the government, and the stronger the nation. Not to mention the developed countries, even the newly independent Burma has established a nation-building assembly representing public opinion; the indigenous people of Java have also set up central and local senates to convey public opinion. Our National Government has returned to the capital for more than three years, and its current position is that it is an important member of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to achieve national reconstruction and complete victory through the joint efforts of officials and the people, it is even more necessary to establish a sound public opinion mechanism from the central government to the local level.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Cultivating Talents and Caring for Youth <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Bearing the spirit of contributing to education and providing scholarships. Hoping all sectors will continue to uphold their consistent spirit.</p>
<p>Since the start of this year's scholarship program on June 16th, the number of applicants has exceeded previous years. The increase in tuition fees at various schools is also several times higher than in the past. Although this newspaper is very willing to provide services to the community, it is deeply concerned that its limited resources may not be able to meet the eager expectations of the students applying. It is planned to set a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan for this year's scholarship fund. Although this amount cannot universally assist all impoverished students, outstanding young people may not lose all hope. In more than a month, thanks to the generosity and strong support of leaders from all walks of life and social leaders, as of today, including the remaining scholarship funds of more than 300,000 yuan from the previous year, the goal of this year's scholarship fund has been basically achieved. This is to solemnly thank all donors and to reassure the students who have applied. After this examination, the primary school grades have been mostly approved. After reviewing the students' academic performance and conduct, as well as the attached essays, the colleagues were deeply moved. The difficult circumstances and excellent academic performance of the students are commendable. However, after carefully reviewing the increase in tuition fees at various schools, some have exceeded the budget when this newspaper began to handle this year's scholarship program. In order to fulfill the students' aspirations to study, this newspaper will appropriately increase the amount of scholarships. It is hoped that all sectors will appreciate this situation and continue to donate to ensure that the scholarship payments are not strained.</p>
<p>Planning ahead for the next term</p>
<p>Before living standards become stable, this newspaper, while having raised a substantial amount for this year's scholarship fund, anticipates that when the next term's scholarship program is held in the winter, it will be at the end of the year and there will be a long holiday. The increase in general tuition fees is unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to hope that during the period between the end of this term and the start of the next term, it will be possible to continuously receive donations from all sectors, which will accumulate and make the next term's scholarship fund more successful. This desire to plan ahead should be understood and supported by people from all walks of life who cultivate talents and care for young people.</p>

<p>This newspaper received over 24,000 yuan from Mrs. Qian Xinfu's 30th birthday celebrations transferred as scholarship donation and 15,000 yuan from Mr. Xia Shikui's fundraising for the scholarship fund.

<p>Criminal cases since August have not been tried due to procedural reasons.</p>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions, the judicial institutions of the city have been adjusted and completed. The cases filed by the former Municipal Council that have not yet been concluded have been heard by the Shanghai District Court. At the hearing, the District Court notified the Procuratorate to send a prosecutor to the court to handle the litigation. As for criminal cases obtained by the police stations since August 1, according to Chinese law, they must first be sent to the Procuratorate for investigation. If the evidence is deemed solid, the prosecutor will prepare an indictment and send it to the District Court, which will then notify the date of the trial. Therefore, due to procedural reasons, the District Court has not yet tried any new cases.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Commentary: Another Act of Commodity Investigation <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The first step in the commodity investigation by the Commodity Investigation Committee, investigating the commodities stored in public warehouses and military depots in the first and eighth districts, has been completed. Now, it has begun to investigate the commodities hoarded in private warehouses. This is another act of commodity investigation. The next act may be extended to private residences. The performance of commodity investigation is becoming more intense, and each act is more nerve-wracking than the last. Those who usually engage in commodity hoarding, even if they feel like cunning rabbits with three burrows, will eventually have nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Such a commodity investigation procedure is what we have been advocating from the beginning. What we especially hope for is that the results of the investigation at each stage can be disclosed nakedly in the future, so that hoarders and speculators will not only be punished legally but also suffer damage to their reputation. In this way, everyone will regard hoarding as a dangerous path, and the practice of hoarding can be eradicated.</p>

<p>The Bankers and Money Changers Association, in view of the urgent need to promote savings and thrift, has resolved at a joint meeting of the banking industry to implement the acceptance of savings and thrift deposits by its members starting from August 8. The agreed measures are recorded below: Extend business hours by one hour. Extend business hours by one hour every month, starting from the 8th of the month, for one week, called "Savings and Thrift Week." If it falls on a Sunday, it will be extended from the next day to complete one week. Display public notices with the words "Promote Savings and Thrift" at the doors of business premises. Each bank will set up a savings and thrift group in the savings department, indicating the extended business hours each week. The extended hours are specifically for accepting savings and thrift deposits. Other business will still be handled according to the original schedule. Banks and money changers that do not handle savings will also extend business hours by one hour each week to accept savings and thrift deposits.

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Fuxing Bank plans to establish a branch at No. 82 Marang Road in the eighth district of the city and has appointed Tang Jiaxian as the branch manager. Preparations are underway, and it is scheduled to open for business around the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Authorities Plan to Adjust Small Flour Mills <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>There are many flour mills in the city, especially small flour mills, totaling no less than dozens. The daily flour output of these small flour mills is inconsistent. The authorities concerned are considering adjusting the various small flour mills to save production costs and increase efficiency. Concrete measures are currently under consideration.</p>
<p>Flour Centralized Distribution</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Centralized Association has formulated sixteen articles on the implementation of centralized distribution of flour for the purpose of distributing flour. It stipulates that all flour produced by flour mills registered with the association will be purchased by the association and then distributed. Businesses that need flour, such as tea food businesses, bakeries, bread shops, and machine-made noodle shops, will be allocated flour by the Commercial Control Association to their respective trade associations, which will then distribute it to member stores.</p>
<p>Actively Purchasing Wheat from Various Regions</p>
<p>This year, the wheat harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has been abundant. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has established branch offices in various regions to implement centralized purchases. The major banks in the city have also provided loans of 100 million yuan for wheat. It is learned that the wheat harvest in various regions has been mostly completed. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has received several batches of wheat in Shanghai and is still actively purchasing wheat in various regions. It is estimated that a maximum of 8 million bags can be collected this year.</p>
<p>Factories in Various Regions Increase Flour Production</p>
<p>Flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and other regions have fully resumed operations since the wheat harvest. Recently, due to the increase in wheat distribution, they have increased night shifts to step up production. The factories have been working at a hectic pace. A small number of factories that have been closed since the incident are also reorganizing their internal affairs, repairing machinery, and preparing to resume operations.</p>

<p>The Eighth District Office has established an economic office, attached to the secretariat, to crack down on hoarding and speculation and curb rising prices. The task of strict pricing is delegated to that office. The chief of the office is the secretary, Zhang Jianchu. The office will start to work within days.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Municipal Police Bureau Cracks Down on Smuggling of Cotton into the City <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural cotton has always been one of the controlled commodities. However, a large amount of cotton has been secretly smuggled into the suburbs of Shanghai. A small number of merchants have been vying to purchase it for profit, which has affected the market and triggered price increases. This is a serious violation of the control policy and is deeply hated. In order to curb price increases and crack down on smuggling, the Second Class Police Bureau has ordered all subordinate sub-bureaus and district police bureaus to strictly prohibit and crack down on smuggling.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Spring Cocoon Purchase Volume Reaches 8 Million Bundles <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>This year's spring cocoon price, after being assessed by the Ministry of Industry, was subject to unified purchase by the joint purchasing offices set up by the China Silk Corporation, the China Silk Industry Corporation, and small silk factories in the interior. As of now, all purchasing work has been completed. According to statistics from the China Silk Corporation, this year's spring cocoon purchase volume reached a record of 8 million bundles. The China Silk Corporation's independent purchase volume also reached a substantial 40,000 bundles. Its success is better than that of cotton, grains, oils, and fats.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Consumer Cooperative Distributes Goods in Nanshi and Huxi <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative, for the first batch of goods allocated to its members, has already distributed them in the central urban area (i.e., the former two concessions). For the Nanshi and Huxi areas, the goods have been sent to the Nanshi Office and the Huxi Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for distribution. However, due to the large number of members and the wide area, delivery is inevitably delayed. The cooperative hopes that members in Nanshi and Huxi will bring their collection receipts from the cooperative and collect the goods themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Japanese-Owned Food Industry Company to Produce Glucose <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Glucose, used in medicine and daily necessities, has considerable nutritional value. Therefore, annual sales in Shanghai and throughout the country are significant. However, due to the backwardness of our domestic chemical industry, the glucose sold on the market is mostly imported. Although some is manufactured in Shanghai, the quantity is very small. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of imported goods was cut off. Thus, glucose, like other pharmaceuticals, became the target of hoarders driving up prices. Moreover, as inventories gradually dwindled, market prices soared continuously. Recently, some pharmacies have even run out of stock. It is learned that the Japanese side, seeing the potential for profit in manufacturing glucose in Shanghai, has established a factory on Xiaoshadu Road by the Shanghai Food Industry Co., Ltd. specifically for the production of glucose. All preparations have now been completed, and the start of production should be imminent.</p>

Chongming Sand Yellow was weak in both arrival and sales. Wheat was scarce, but with flour mills buying, prices trended upward, already above the six-dollar mark.</p>
<p>Tea Market: Tea transactions remained sluggish, mainly because shops on this street were still extremely cautious. Market sentiment was calm with few changes.

In addition, Dingxin Tea Stack sold twelve dan of stir-fried green tea to the Shanghai Tea Company.

As for the red tea tips favored by the New Asia Pharmaceutical Chemical Plant, the goods purchased by the old buyers on the market in recent days were all used in Guan Gong for tea essence, so they had no time to inquire, while the new buyers repeatedly inspected, resulting in a low price, and because it could not be approached, there were no transactions.</p>
