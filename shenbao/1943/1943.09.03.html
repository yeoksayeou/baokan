<p>社評</p>
<h3>重視政治責任</h3>
<p>當這次歐戰中，德法媾和以後，法國政府當局，下令逮捕前任閣僚如總理雷諾，國防部長達拉第，法軍司令甘茂林等，追究發動戰事及失敗之資任。我們並非對這件事的木身，辨解其是非。而是指出他們對於「責任」的重視</p>
<p>昔三國時代，蜀有馬謖，好論軍計，諸葛亮深重之，引爲參軍，後出軍祁山，以謖爲先鋒，因違亮節度而大敗，遂下獄以死。近年，雖如重慶政權，也有數事可記：如長沙大火事件，警備司令鄷悌，執行槍決。滇緬路私運商貨事件，林世良死罪，許性初下獄。成都囤積糧食操縱抬價事件，縣長楊全宇死刑。凡此所舉，也可以指出對於「實任」的重視，古今中外，莫不盡然。</p>
<p>自從國府還都以來，政治上最大的缺點，不必諱言的，是在賞罰不明。無賞罰，遂致無紀律，無是非，於是政治效率，幾等於零。寖假而狡黠者扶植爪牙，權詐百出，席懦者隨波逐流，敷衍搪塞。人民大衆，敢怒而不敢言。稍有識見者，以噤若寒蟬，視爲明哲保身。於是日路愈塞，曙光益滅。此種現象，在承平時代，已爲國勢衰頹之微，况當千鈞一髮的決戰時代，豈能任令此政治修明的大敵，無賞罰現象的存在。我們激於愛進政府，愛護民生的情緒，不辭聲色夕厲，而爲迫切的呼籲曰：「中國國家復興，人民生活安定，端賴政治修明；而政治修明，必自以賞罰嚴明始。」</p>
<p>一般的　，政府對於某一公務員有了失職行爲，充其量予以一免聯「了事，而於失職的責任範圍，並不追究自然更未見論罪與定刑的事了。如果說這是政治上弊絕風淸的證明，我們實在不敢作此自欺欺人的誑語。</p>
<p>目前和以往政治上無賞罰的事例，我們不願如　家珍的列舉，只想舉出兩點以說明：</p>
<p>以小者而言，據傳上海自租界接收以後，有兩個警察分局的負責者，到任不及旬日、即舞弊受賄達數十萬元之鉅，東窗事發，僅予免職，免職以後如何處置，就未聞下落。空穴來風，其來有自。在大上海市行政歸於一元的序幕甫經揭展，即有此種敗類挿足，我們認爲未能僅以免職了事，必須追尋資任，依法處治，以爲後來者炯戒，以振大衆的視聽。</p>
<p>以大者而言，最近的糧食問題，弄得一團槽糕。自從七月初，由友邦日本主持的中支米穀配給組合，移轉職權與國人主持的米糧聯營社，當時，人民大衆對於該社期待的殷切，可以說發自衷心的，大家對之期待的理由，似乎國人辦後，一切可得合理的調整，自己人總更能爲自已人打算了。可是，兩個月來的事實，與期待極端相反，配給戶口米的數量，原來已感不敷，而這兩月中，不是延期，就是减量，什麼解釋，什麼聲明，掩不住事實的粉碎，欲蓋則彌彰，「理由」恰成爲過失。現在雖因聯營社辦理不善而裁撤，另有新機構接辦，如何更張改善，這是以後的事，暫且不談。但是聯營社與主管糧政的糧食部糧食局等，絕對不便輕描淡寫的　却責任，如果把這樣重大的民生政事，不負責任，視同兒戲，今天交給甲辦，辦糟了，莫問是非，明天換交乙辦；如果乙也辦糟了，那末，還不是莫問是非，後天換交丙辦呢？政府不嚴，辦者逍遙，人民受苦，層層相因，伊於胡底。如果今天對甲不究責任，不明賞罰，那末，明天怎樣課乙以責任，使之警惕是非而期以辦理完善呢？</p>
<p>因此，我們要責望後來者一反前人之非，懷於責任，期以改善，那末，就非先判明前者的責任，而依法的處置不可。米糧聯營社之辦理不善，顯有少數不良份子利令智昏，從中舞弊。盛傳若輩以日本軍隊需要軍米爲藉口，往產米區域以低價向農民收買，如有緩，威脅隨之。實際上日軍需要重米，向有一定限度，在鄕民或常地鄕區公署，受「軍米」口實的威脅，無法抗拒，忍痛出貨。因此，鄕民的怨　，完全集嫁於日軍，印象深刻。若輩這種行爲，不僅利己害公，危及民生，抑且挑撥中日情感惡化，簡直破壞政府和平運動的方策，這是不可恕者一。其次，若輩旣以低價脅購糧食以後，以之囤積，故意不即運滬配給，一方面則私運一部分，利用肩販以黑市價銷售，同時，抬高黑市價格，以遂暴利。用心之毒，手段之辣，令人髮指。這種行爲是破壞戰時經濟之基礎，破壞社會秩序之安寧，這是不可恕者二。至於推諉運輸阻滯者，主管當局也應視爲職務內的責任，向各方面交涉，據理力爭，我們相信友邦方面基於中日協力的前提，不會拒絕留難的。所以，運輸阻滯一點，幷不能糟詞推諉。縱是事買，也屬未能善盡職責。</p>
<p>如果所傳盡實，若輩不良分子，直是危害國家，蠢及社會，侵蝕民生之尤者，主管機關已不能辭失察之責，豈能僅以解散免職了事，國家紀綱與刑律又豈能視爲具文呢？</p>
<p>我們蜴誠的主張，政府應以重視政治責任爲修明政治，改善民生的唯一要綱，而以嚴明賞罰，整飭紀律爲入手方法，一般的今後的政治設施，固應如此；而目前的上述的案件，更不能輕忽。爲了國家社會與民生前途，不勝迫切期待！</p>

<p>里斯本二日中央社電　倫敦消息：反軸心國航空員於星期二日空襲柏林囘歸後，以大量德戰　機之迎擊而感覺驚奇。某航空員稱，此次之空襲，乃爲一緊張而驚險之空戰，自渡海起以至囘來止，全程中均遭德機之攔擊。某轟炸機被擊三次，第一次爲蓉克八十八式所襲，其餘兩次係被一單引擎飛機所攻擊，德機突然進攻敵機，此次並不利用探照燈以搜尋敵蹤，而由飛機放照明彈。某航空員稱，該項照明彈之光度，於飛至柏林之路上成一片之光明。</p>
<h3>南路德突圍成功　正待機反攻　德機千架炸蘇供應綫</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電</p>
<p>德軍當局　日發表德軍在泰幹洛格突破重國之詳悄稱，蘇軍機械部隊雖曾企圖以騎兵爲先鋒，突入包圍下之德軍中央部，但德坦克部隊及對戰車砲隊突於三十日晚間擊毀蘇軍超重坦克二十五輛，當突破包圍　立即轉作猛烈反政，除俘虜蘇軍千餘名外，更將其一個坦克旅團完全殲滅，於昨與德軍之主力會合，目下德軍已以地雷陣完全阻止蘇軍進擊，且正待機反攻。</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊東綫卡科夫區西夫斯克附近與吉倫佳區等處，繼續進行激烈之防禦戰，蘇軍由中路與北路調得生力軍加入作戰，中部唐納資前綫蘇軍亦重起活動，集中槍兵數師團，坦克車數隊，與砲　一大隊，蘇軍顯然巳放棄其由南北二而包圍德軍師團之意，而決定再作正面之進攻。伏羅希洛夫格勒區之陣綫，據最近之電訊，巳照原定計劃加以縮短。同時德轟炸機一千架以上，向蘇軍供應交通集中攻擊，在此破壞力極大之空襲中，蘇軍損失重大，德主力機數百架以尖片炸彈與機關槍火轟炸蘇軍之攻勢行動，結果各據點敵軍之行動處於停頓之狀態。</p>
<h3>奎貝克會談中　反攻緬甸舊事重提</h3>
<p>第六次英美奎貝克會談，關於反軸心方面應付今後世界戰局的政略戰略大綱，據傳業巳檢討完畢。詳細硏究當地所得的諸情雜，准此次會談中，美國反對英國所全張的歐洲第一主義，而力主進行太平洋戰爭。</p>
<p>英美意見分歧</p>
<p>英國各報强調李貝克會談具有劃時期重要性，此次會談對强襲歐洲大陸要塞應加以最後的決定。至於美國方面，於會談達最高潮的二十日，美國陸軍部次長彼得生在火奴魯魯作豪語稱：「爲要給與日本以潰滅的打擊，故目前正在積極準備，以大量裝備及補充品運輸至東亞。」美岡對日本在東亞全培的防禦日見强化一事。深感焦慮。英美之間關於東西二戰塲戰力的分配，意見依然未能一致。</p>
<p>屢據報告，在美國國內，最近「太平洋戰局視同等閑的結果，日本的防禦，幾巳堅不可拔，今後的對日戰爭，恐將有極大的犧牲。」這種見解，漸趨有力。又開戰之初，國內一般人士的見解均認爲「日本自己知道長期戰的不利，而希望短期決戰。」這新見解，今日巳潛形滅跡。即使在美國的軍事專門家之間，一般的意見均認爲「時間現在對日本軍方商有利地起着作用。日本目前正在善用最貴重的時間。」祇因國事被與論所支配，所以美國當局以國內焦慮的增大爲背景，在此次會談中，强要英國方而關於太平洋反攻的詳細準備，並其時日與塲所，迅作決定。英國情報部長普萊登普賴　氏最近作宣誓式的整明稱：「德國打倒後，英國誓必全面的協力日木。」以安慰美國的太平洋　一主義，但這也無非想　量集中美國戰力以實施歐洲第一主義而巳。</p>
<p>一味拖延時日</p>
<p>據奎貝克來電，關於政洲戰事中展開第二戰綫之時日，有於本年夏未開始攻擊之設。另一說則主張本年冬季集中對德轟炸，着手明春的攻擊。後者的主張，根本把登陸戰延期至明年春季，犧牲少而成功大。假使這主張實現，則可能引起要求目前立即展開第二戰綫的蘇聯的猛烈反對，結果，奎貝克會談中，關於加緊轟炸德國，儘量提早强　歐洲大陸的機會的時機問題，並沒有達到明白的結論。至於登陸地點，預定爲義大利，法國北部南部海岸。但傳說美國當局自第五次會談以來即巳主張直接在北法海岸登陸決戰。這是想早日結束歐戰而集中戰力以向太平洋方面。在這一點上，也可以窺知美國怎樣地焦慮太平洋方面。</p>
<p>美國雖這樣深切地關心，但歐戰第一義的形態，尙　放棄。實際上說來，把世界戰略像這樣一分爲二來加以考察及處理，豪無必要。視歐洲戰的規模如何而對太平洋方面傾注全力。例如第五次會談後所表現的地中海攻勢與南太平洋攻勢同時推進的的戰法，未必不可能。那就是說以奎貝克會議爲轉捩的緬甸反攻論，被注意的緣故卽在於此。奎貝克會談中，與西南太平洋方面有深切關係的澳洲，未有代表出席，而重慶代表宋子文却頗活躍，從援助重慶及收復緬甸的不可分性推究起來，緬甸作戰顯然是此次會談的中心問題。美聯社奎貝克來電所傅，緬甸戰役在反軸心東亞戰略中佔最重要的地位。</p>
<p>反攻緬甸計劃</p>
<p>該次作戰的司令官，英第八軍蒙高美萊將軍的呼聲頗高。每日郵報的奎貝克電、亦有任命美將史蒂威爾之說。從這一切情報看來，不難想像在奎貝克會談中業巳樹立緬甸作戰的一般計劃。但其實行的時間，則尙傳說紛紜，而以十月以降的雨季爲期，似巳成爲定論。英美採用何種戰法以實施此次反攻戰呢？殊難預料，唯大要如次：</p>
<p>因阿拉　的險峻，阻止重火器機甲部隊的大量移動，故大規模的反攻，先奪取孟加拉灣的制海制空權，用艦船登陸。在這塲合，海軍方面預期以英海軍爲主體，抽調有力艦隊至東亞，以航空母艦爲主的美國海軍，也將參加。</p>
<p>空軍方面，前述彼得生曾　稱，儘量援助中國，故美國飛機將担任重大的任務。</p>
<p>陸軍方面，英國從西亞抽調一部份來此，以英印軍爲主體，大部份由美國的印度派遣軍組成。美國須遣送二十萬至三十萬的新軍以供此項用途。</p>
<p>以上是奎貝克會談中所定的「計劃」，至共「成否」，不用說自是另一個問題。（翔：躍自八月二十五日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>中日共同組織　查定委會成立</h3>
<p>審查收買紗布品質價格昨開成立會分三部審查</p>
<p>中央社訊　全國商業統制總會收買棉紗棉布辦事處，對於收買紗布品質價格之確定，特依據組織大綱第五條之規定，聘請素有紡織技術專家，及富有紗市經騐者爲委員，成立收買棉紗棉布品質價格査定委員會，分爲棉紗，白坏棉布，加工棉布三組，分別查定價格？茲該處爲統一決定價格，及品質檢査之步驟，雙方交換意見研究起見，特與中華日平貿易聯合會臨時棉紗棉布管理事務局組織之查定委員會，聯合組織中日共同妝買棉紗棉布品質價格查定委員會，於昨日下午三時，在跑　　三〇四號，召開聯席成立會議。茲將會議情形分誌如下：</p>

<p>投保火險</p>
<p>商統會奉令收買本市地區內棉紗棉布後，聞太平保險公司曾函該會當局，建議收買之紗布，似有投保火險　要，本布華商保險公司多　九十餘家，曾組有四個集理，　請由各該集團代表公司承辦，同時又據中央信託股份有限公司函，以該公司係國營組織，亦請予　保，茲悉商統會爲此項收買之紗布數量極巨，曾約美太平，中央信　局等常經酌爲核定負責成分如下；　太平保險公司百分之四十，（代表太平分保集團）　寳豐保險公司百分之二十，（代表久聯分保集團）　中國　　保險公司　分之二十，（代　　上海分保集團）　中央信託公司百分之二十。（共中百分之十五由巾央分給華商聯合保險公司轉分與其屬下各公司）。</p>
<p>收買棉紗棉布辦事處，以日來本市各商號及各工廠前往領取及　送出賣申請書表等，以限期急道，人數更形擁擠，茲悉該處爲體恤商民並加緊工作起見，自本月三日起至本月六日止，每日辦公時間特別提早並延長，改爲上午八時起至下午五時止，中間分組辦公並不休息。五日（星期日）亦照常辦公，至該項出賣申請手續，仍限本月六日截止，決不予以展期。</p>
<p>袁愈佺氏解釋各點</p>
<p>中央社滬訉國府爲調節物價安定民生起見，對於現存之棉紗棉布，令飭全國商業統制總會，依照公布之收買暫行條例，實施收買。但上海市區內商號工廠，於該收買辦事處辦理補行登記及申請出賣期問，對該條例第三條第三項（零售商）第四項（製造廠）但書之規定，頗多誤解，竟敢不法傾銷，或不法使用，實業部袁次長愈佺，昨特以此事，在滬接見中日記者，發表談話解釋如下：「在政府實施收買棉紗棉布條例，其立　旨趣，固不論零售商製造商之棉紗棉布，自予澈底收買，紗布兩業廠商，勢將悉行停業，惟政府當局極爲關懷民瘼，顧念人民之實際需要小安定民生，故在該條例第三條第三第四項而有但書，惜商人對該條文不獨未淸滯瞭解，而致不法。査該第三條第三項對零售商收買之棉紗布，原留有餘地，第四項對加工製造工廠，亦可照常製造，唯不　規定零售製造　　，以不超過三十二年上半年平均之一個月零停及需用數量一者，認爲合法，否則卽為違法，　　之，零售商如從他人手中買來而零售，或製造商從他人手中買來而製造，亦是違法。如零售及製造商，　爲自巳存貨。但其零售及製造數量。仍超出上半年平均之一月數量，仍是違法。最近據聞自收買條例公布，及實施收買進行期中，一般商號以低價傾銷，一般工廠，以非正常消費量使用，更是不法行爲，彼等之超過平均數量，當局決依法處置，現政府決令地方政府及有關機關，進行調査，尤希人民共同協助政府既　政策，　制此種不法舉動。還有一點重大問題，就是在公布出賣申請期間，同時汪主席巳發表聲明中，商人對己登記之棉紗布，在法定期間內而不申請出買。即是反抗　府政策，政府亦決分別嚴予處置，至　行登　之紗布，亦須在法定期內申請出賣，否則政府決予沒收其貨，毋勿自誤而違法。政府公布收買條例與懲治囤積條例，完全符合，並不接觸，最後尚有兩點値得說明：　政盼當局對配給辦法及收買價格，於　內即由物資審議會通過公布，　棉紗布廠商保險　約（　當時保價及現莽法定收買價）被保保方之縱利問題，政府正在考慮滴當辦法中云云。末　中　記者歷舉　項重要問題相　　為由袁次長逐一解答。</p>

<p>統一警政年底完成　　據渡氏解釋　給果將使各警局工作之消飛減輕，第一·三兩區警力之混合，其第一步驟乃在先完成乎西特區及第一區之合倂，該兩區捐稅執照費及其他行施措施，日前暫時仍歸各自執行，但當於本年底　前實現。　　滬西警員薪金提增　　滬西警局人員之薪金，將提增至與第一警局相等之問題，據渡氏透露刻在研討中，鑒於兩區城組織及制度上之不同，渡氏稱：將逐漸使其改革。第一區警力，經此擴大與合併後，效率將大爲增進。但一標準化之工作制度之實現則尙需時日。</p>
<p>八區警局亦將合倂</p>
<p>關於舊法和界之警制，渡氏　與第一區警局各方面皆爲不同，於三個月內，亦將予以合併。至於閘北及市中心區之警制。則屬村野之組織，故無須將其改變，因其與都市警察之制度，完全不同也。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點二十分</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>戶口米</h3>
<p>這兩月來，戶口米配給，不是延期，就是減量，使關係民生困　的糧　問題，益發增加其嚴重性了。對這問題，我們在每個角落　聽到大衆的呼聲，不是失望，就是怨尤。甚者　連到租界接收後的不幸。於此，我們敬告布民同胞，不必消極的失望與怨尤。應該奮起職能，積極的督促當局爲大衆利益而改善調整。</p>
<p>現在管　糧倉的機構，將次更新組織了，我們深切期待新機構的一新面目，眞為大衆解決問題，主持人選方面，聞有社會公正人士參加，這是更値引為慶幸的事。</p>
<p>但是，據市上傅說，戶口米有增加售價以及收買水市存米的消息，我們認爲這是不妥常的。因爲，第一，戶口米官價，很有領導各種物價的作用，如果米官價一漲，別的物價很可能隨之上漲，這與抑平物價方策顯然衝突與矛盾的。第二，目前沐市工廠的存米，巳非囤積居奇可比，大多數爲　充工人戶口米的不足而購存的，如果予以收買，除非今後的配給量增加至最低足額，否則反易引起恐慌，召致不　心理。</p>
<p>我們期望當局應從積極方面着想，在產米區以合理價格收買，疏通運輸，暢流於途，絕對準期，逐漸增量，這才是釜底抽薪的辦法。</p>
<p>評言</p>
<h3>觀望</h3>
<p>從好的方　解釋，「觀望」是虛心的表現；從不好的方面解釋，「觀望」是心虛的表現；虛心不失爲謹慎，心虛則斷然爲懦怯。今日的上海金融商品市塲，人心一致虛怯，懷存觀望態度，以致市氣奄然，是爲心虛的病態；心虛則意志游移薄弱，而其行爲的表現則爲：　空作妄想，　輕信謠言，　諮更不前其原因由於事理認識之不足，其結果則爲自誤。</p>
<p>何謂自誤？收買棉紗布決不延期了，其「仍有心存觀望，希求一再延期者，結果必至遭受懲罰，日用品價格，既因政府定價收買棉紗布而日趨跌落了，共有國積日用物品猶待善價而沽者，結果必至求售不得；金融機關及有資者巳經得到嚴重的敎訓了，其仍有不能忘情於從前的貸款利潤以及投機利益者，結果必至一無所成。凡此種種，豈不都是自誤　？</p>
<p>避免自誤，在於改正今日之觀望態度，積極從事於正當的打算，合理的經　；以前種種，「譬如昨日死」，以後種種，須轉而移於生產事業，或爲投資，或爲儲蓄，以充實生產事業之資金。這纔是正常合理的辦法。</p>

<h3>母佑會女修院訪問記二苦難女子的學府中國母佑會的故事</h3>
<p>東方國家、在最近數十年來，工業也有長足的發展，工廠制度不幸的副產品，貧苦的流浪兒，也充斥於各大城市。而在東方封建制度和天災匪患所造成的苦難的流浪兒，其急待救濟敎養，較歐美各國，更爲迫急而有意義。於是在最近半世紀以來，母佑會先後在印度，在澳州，在南洋各地創辦起來，對於遙遠的中國，她們久有前來敎助之心，可惜向沒有機會，直到民國十二年（一九二三）隨着鮑斯高慈幼會的發展，迫切感到創辦母佑會以敎養中國流浪女兒的必要，於是，首先在廣　內地　關（曲江）　辦，以筏更發展到樂局等地。滴應中國各地特殊的襲培與需要，她們除了舉辦孤兒院，小學校，中學校、師範學校，工藝院之外，還設立養老院，殘廢院等。近來都在中華區會長和多理大姆姆主持之下，獲得當地各界熱烈的讚佩。二十年來，敎養成功的貧苦女兒，數以千計；對於社會的貢獻。眞是無法估計的。此外一般慈善事業，如救濟殘廢孤老以及施診給藥等，可以借一句中國的成話來形容，就是一萬家生佛。」</p>
<p>上海母佑會婦修院創辦於民國二十三年（九三四）初在閑北寳興路，借新華儲落銀行地產部的一幢小洋房爲會址。抓時在上海熱心推行慈善事業的陸伯鴻先生在八字橋（今改稱廣中路）辦有「母心醫院，」就由母佑會的修女姆姆們主持，在事面附設孤兒院。堂　莊嚴的院舍，芳草如茵的廣塲，滿以爲是萬年不動的其業了。不意戰事爆發，母心醫院變成中日軍隊爭奪的電要據點，爲砲火所集中，修女醫師病人與孤兒們在砲火中倉皇他避，四年來河山未殊，而故址巳成一片瓦礫堆了。</p>
<p>當時母佑會的基業全被燬滅，修女姆姆們避　新閘路難民救濟處及呂班路傷兵醫院，完全以天主愛人的敎義，盡宗敎家救闲扶危的責任，爲難民及傷兵服務。約有六個月之久。但是敎養孤苦女童事業，仍一日未忘。至民國二十七年，始在楊樹浦路福蘭路租賃民房，收容刧後孤兒。其後又有華盛路顧宅自願惜用。但在非常時期，社會秩序尙未恢復，修女們在意想以外的困難和危險之中，支持扶孤救難的事業。今天梁　華姆姆講談起來，不能不令人肅然然起敬。</p>
<p>上海母佑會的事業與人物</p>
<p>民國二十八年（一九三九）上海社會漸趨安定。然而苦難的子女們，日增無已，街頭巷尾。充滿着無依無敎的流浪兒童。急待收容敎養。而每天扣門求救及棄置在門口的病孩與嬰兒，更是不忍不顧。實際上所有院所，不足收容，於是在楊樹浦　武路電車站對面，　地八畝餘，先建洋樓一　，至去年添建洋房一所，積極推進敎養流浪孤苦女兒的事　　的意義。</p>
<p>母佑會的工作，依照該會　照母的遺訓，在於敎育訓導一般流浪無告的苦難女童，並辦理各種社會　舉，主要的事業爲孤兒院，幼稚園，小學校，中學校，女工寄宿合，女工補習夜校，假期學校，　　院，家庭工　實　學校等。對於一般孤苦兒童，使得一般良好國民的基礎知識，並習得與性悄及天資　相宜的工藝使將來各食自力。安家立業，爲社會掃除寄生蟲，爲國家培育新人材。對於一般女工及苦難婦女，亦盡力使有求學進步機會，認識人生眞正的意義與正當的樂趣。</p>
<p>現在上海主持母佑會女修院的是義大利人和多理大姆姆，她同時還主持着華南部州等地的母佑會事業。從　常常往返於滬粵各地。現在爲了戰事，交通不便，己有好幾年沒有去廣東探視：雖然保持　通信　　，但是，談　來，大姆姆還是　提到了久別的兄女一樣，幾乎老淚　簌的掉下來。大姆姆之下有議藉姆姆幾位，愛爾蘭籍姆姆一位，葡萄牙籍姆姆一位，本國籍姆姆十二位。梁麗華姆姆雖然年輕，但是宗敎的素養　戰的態度　辦事的才幹，可為母佑會姆姆的典型人物。她常為　　養孤苦女兒的事業，與和多理大姆姆或蔣姆姆等，向本市各　善家，熱心的紳士太太們，以及社會敎育專家們要求物質上精神上的協助。在　苦難的時代，這種　捐的工作自然更加雛了，而她們任勞任怨，爲善業而犧牲，她們始終露出　面的笑容。（以下轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>對於倡辦敎職員消費合作社的意見</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>自蔣　同君倡議組織敎職員消費合作社以來，連日報載關於組織該社之文字，已有不少，都人亦有所感，爰　管見如次：</p>
<p>消費合作社在　平會之舉，在此米珠　　的之時，巳是一種有益於社時期，居於最貧困階層中的敎職員對之更　　要。是以現在對於教職員消費合作社組織的要點，在於如何促甚早日實現。</p>
<p>敎職員消費合作社之組織，自須取得各學校當局，學生家長以及社會各界之援助，但合作社之本身，須有獨立堅實之組織。辦事人之職責皆有明確之規定，各辦事人員不妨由各校當局派充，其在合作社所　之事等於在校辦公，薪水在原校孤取原任薪額。辦事人之多少視合作社之需要而定，每校應派出幾人視各該校之範圍或能力而定。</p>
<p>物品之分發。不必以學校爲單位，亦不必由各校自行領　分發，可設若千分發物品處，其地點選擇市內較爲寬敞之學校，請其劃出一相當地位作爲辦事處，所派駐之辦事員不必爲所在校之職員。分發物品　須平均分設。務使居住於本市任何角落之社員均可步行不　，卽可領購物品而不過廢時間。各分發　之在貨視所頜轄之區域而定其多寡，或若干物品領購一次卽可供一月或半月之用者不妨特別規定，　在總社分　。</p>
<p>以上不過就嚴管所及，略陳其概。至於消費合作社爲一種最適合時代之組織，是以目前對於嚴社之組織，巳爲實踐問題，似不宜多費時問於理論上之檢討。如能早一日成立，即爲教職早一日之受益，亦卽爲敎育上之益也。（陳潛）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>讀蔣　同君之「敎職員消費合作社的建立與內容」一文後，同人等對蔣君的先知先覺，深爲佩服。蔣君所發表的十條組織的內容，大致無甚問題；惟對於組成後之進行辦法稍有愚見發表：</p>
<p>登記　由敎育界有名望的公正人士主持後，立卽登報招收社員，由各該校負責人義務辦理，以責而省手續。</p>
<p>調查　凡調查員應至各該校嚴密書令社員及家屬正確人數，不能聽憑各眩校負責人的報告，因內中不免有虛報　　等情發生。</p>
<p>採辦　社員直接向各物產地區大批購買時，一定要有許多困難。所以，應與當局密切合作，以减少麻煩。</p>
<p>配給　配給情形，應依職位高低收入多寡而定。譬如大學教授每月每人配米一斗，中學敎師配與一斗五升，小學敎員麽配與二斗，其他物品也依此類推。</p>
<p>收費　收費時若不便的話，則可暫時拖欠，在下月薪水中由負責人扣除。（程起　）</p>
<h3>母佑會婦修院訪問記（第三版轉入）</h3>
<p>「左右轉灣走！」</p>
<p>朝陽下的草塲上，兩隊女健兒在母佑會修女姆姆指揮下早操，活潑，整齋，緊張，嚴肅，有些學校的正式軍事訓練，還沒有這麽令人感動呢！下操了，孩子們圍住了姆姆，在講些什麼，一會兒捲起了一片小掌聲，揚溢着親愛熱烈的情緒。</p>
<p>五六年級的敎室裏，一班補習生在靜靜地工作着，黑版上寫着作文題「署期的生活。」修女姆姆和婉地在替幾個學生們解說。別的幾個教室，因爲在暑假期內，都在淸掃整備，聖母像片和各科常識掛圖，和簡明警人的格言，給人深刻的印象。校舍是新建的，型式和構造，都適合於現代敎　的實際需要。光棧，空氣和內部的佈置，引起明朗，爽怏和興奮的感覺。</p>
<p>濟靈女子學校專收附近一般貧苦家庭的女子，給與現代國民必需的知識，並使在窮苦汚濁的環境中，不受社會腐惡思想與習慣的傳染，認識人生的正當意義，找到自已今後光明的出路。程度和普通完全小學一樣，計分六級，上學期計有學生一百六十餘名，下學期報名的人數已經不少。敎職員室　正辦到一大批「國定」敎科書，在趕着整理，原凍快要開學了。</p>
<p>母佑會裏附設的第二十六民衆夜校，是由「市敎育局」出資辦理的，專收附近女工，授以民衆補習敎育。上學期有學生一百名，不過女工有共特　環境與困難，如助理家務等等牽累，如果不能引起她們向學的興趣，使她們迫切感到來校讀書的需要，往往開始時熱烈。慢慢的就有輟學的現象。所以必須在諜程與內容之切合女工需要，及敎　方法之改善上加以硏究呢。</p>
<p>母佑會敎育事業有一個特點，就是對學生負責，不僅在講授的時間認眞與嚴格。知識敎授與品格訓練並重，而且對於女生的出路也非常注意。對於失學及出校女生貧無所依者，都能替她們找到適當的工作。現在介紹在科發大藥廠做工的就有五十八名之多。</p>
<h3>孤兒院·慶禮院·施診所</h3>
<p>孤兒院和托兒所·是母佑會的基本事業，也是最先在上海舉辦的。不幸於滬戰中全部燬滅。後來力圖恢復，但以屋小錢少，規模不大。現有孤女四十餘名，年幼的五六歲，給與幼稚園敎育，年長的十多歲，除了普通國民敎育以外，另給與謀生必需的工藝技術。現分紡織，裁縫『烹飪，　結，修補等科，紡織室內有幾架織襪，紡織品編結機，搖紗機等，女孩子們正忙着工作。架上疊着製成的長統襪，絨綫衫，和代人修補的毛絨衣類。裁縫問備洧縫衣機及　熨設備，有一個外國姆姆在敎導女孩工作，代人修補西裝和襯彩的領袖。孩子們都愉快地忙碌着，有幾個巳有十七八歲。捧出些工作成績來，使每一個參觀者都感覺滿意。姆姆說：她們出院就可以不作流浪無事者，成爲社會的生產份子。</p>
<p>慶禮院是聖若望鮑斯高神父所創辦的兒童敎養事業中値得特別介紹的一種制度。就是每逢假期或節日，有許多學生，在家無事，又無入指導，只在里巷閒蕩；或者做些無益而有害的事情；又有一般頑童，一向失學，流浪街頭，永遠得不到人類的愛撫和文化的熏陶。慶禮院就專爲變些兒意敞開大門　讓孩子們進來，隨意去敎室聽講，或去工作室參　實習，或去體育塲運動，或去游樂塲作集體的游戲，務使孩子們感到慶禮院生活之新鮮活潑可愛從此不再在街頭流浪或涉足於不當的塲所，上海母佑曾，也辦有慶禮院，不過從前的　備已經被燬於戰火，芷有待於社會上的扶助她們的復興工作。</p>
<p>母佑會除了對於孩子們的敎養事業之外，也不忽視社會慈善事業，對於一般貧苦人民疾病的救濟，尤爲努力。現在雖然經費萬分困難、還在松潘路開辦一處施診所，經常從事施診給藥，凡是赤貧病人，完全免費，有的自願交費的，也不過幾角錢而己。門診部由一位出身於目心醫院具有豐富醫學知　和經驗的修女姆姆負　主持，每天下午二時至五時施診。過去一年間，據說送診名額超過四千。現在除了科發大藥房每逢聖誕節捐助藥品一天外，其餘如中四，集成等各大藥房，每月或到相當時間，足而需要另行　　的，每月也在千元左右。</p>
<h3>女修院生活的素描</h3>
<p>母佑會女　院的大門口，和附近的路旁，常常有被抛棄了的嬰孩，有的是父母太窮子女太多，無法撫育；有的是患病無力求醫，或是認爲無法救治的；修女們看到了，自然不能無惻隱之心，因此一向就竭力救護。健康的量力撫養。有病的盡力療治，死亡的代備棺木掩埋。其中限於經費，無力收容的，就代爲護送到徐家匯聖母院或是南市新普育堂，但大多數是盡力收養了，像自己的女兒和妹妹一樣愛護。</p>
<p>母佑會孤兒和無家可歸的苦難女子；現在還有五十餘人；但奇怪的是個個都很健康活潑。據和多理大姆姆說：該會的經費雖然困難，但是修女們對於孤兒們的生活，營養和健康是非常注意的。說着話跑　了她們的廚房，姆姆揭開　　，立刻噴出紅米飯的香味　旁邊的鍋子裏煮着自己栽種的南瓜，紗橱裏堆積　幾十隻鷄蛋，還有鮮牛肉哩，幾個孤女正在實習烹飪，在科學的設施之下，連一隻蒼蠅也飛不進來。據說儘管修女們常常挨着餓去勸募，但是她們努力維持孤女們暫是的膳食；每月有二次可以向垃圾橋的中央市塲勸募到價値四五百元的小菜，每月三次可以向虹口小菜塲勸寡得一二百元的　素食品。可是，五十多人的食米却成了大問題，戶口米不足；近來更增憂慮。而米是勸募不到的。</p>
<p>洗衣間和裕室都不很大，也沒有什麼新式的科學化的設備，浴室更只有一座熱水灶和疊成寳塔式的大大小小的未製浴盆。但是淸潔得很，也有一位姆姆負責管理。孩子們的衣服，大部分是姆姆們向各界募來的，經過修改，都很潔凈，　素而合身，一點也沒有孤女的寒酸相，但是近來捐到的衣服或衣料日見稀少，以後會鬧衣的恐慌吧！修女們在擔心了。</p>
<p>二　樓是「初學院」，這是母佑院事業繼承者的訓練所，專收一般對宗教有熱誠的了解與信心，對於敎養孤貧流浪女兒的事業且有犧牲服務的決心的女信徒，至少要有中學畢業的程度，才得收納。初學院的課程，除了聖經與宗教方而學識之外，主要的是敎養流浪苦難女兒的學識與技能。普通要經過兩年的訓練，經過相當時期的實習，才得「姆姆」的尊稱。她們矢志終身犧牲爲貧女及宗敎服務而入女修院之後，就永遠不能囘到俗家，不過家裏的人還可以來探望，握手言歡。犧牲服務所得精神上的愉快，決不是俗家　　之悄所能比擬的啊　只有當此善業因經費困竭而陷於無法維持的困境之時，眼看一班孤女在被教養時之後又有前途茫茫之感，姆姆們說到這裏，不自知地揮下幾滴熱淚！</p>
<p>孤女們的臥室，現因暑假，借佔了三個教室，依年齡長幼而分居。但一律有一人或二人合臥的　牀，蚊帳和其他用品，整齊淸潔而安靜，小雀在　口喳喳地呌着跳着，陽光照映在臥室裏高懸着的聖母像上，發出柔和的光芒，每晚臨睡前，她們在聖母像下誠　地祈禱，她們感謝社會上熱心人士與慈善家的慷慨捐助，祝福他們和她們健康與事業成功。姆姆說：該會經費來源；大部由水埠各界捐助，不敷之數，由義大利母佑會補助，自前年十二月八日以來，本埠捐款來源减少，國外補助停止，本年請求上海市貧病救濟協會補助，經委員調査，認為辦理完善而經濟困難，應盡力維持，曾一次補助四千五百元，最近八月下旬又繼續一次補助四千五百元。但日常開支，隨物價而高漲，每月至少需萬元以上，至今巳到無法維持的困難境地了。修女和孤女們只有虔誠地祈禱，希望社會上的協助，她們的捐册上題着光芒四射的聖經上的金句：</p>

        <h1>1943.09.03</h1>
<h3>Emphasizing Political Responsibility</h3>
<p>Following the German-French armistice during the recent European war, the French government ordered the arrest of former cabinet members such as Premier Reynaud, Minister of Defense Daladier, and French Commander Gamalin, to investigate their responsibility for initiating and failing in the war. We do not intend to argue the merits of this specific event. Rather, we point out the importance they placed on "responsibility."</p>
<p>In the past, during the Three Kingdoms period, Shu had Ma Su, who enjoyed discussing military strategies. Zhuge Liang valued him highly and appointed him as a staff officer. Later, when the army marched towards Qishan, Su was made the vanguard, but he disobeyed Liang's directives and suffered a major defeat, leading to his imprisonment and death. In recent years, even the Chongqing regime has had several noteworthy instances. For example, in the case of the Changsha fire, the garrison commander Feng Ti was executed. In the Yunnan-Burma Road smuggling case, Lin Shiliang received the death penalty, and Xu Xingchu was imprisoned. In the Chengdu grain hoarding and price manipulation case, county magistrate Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death. All these examples illustrate the importance placed on "actual responsibility," a consistent theme throughout history, both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Since the National Government's return to the capital, the biggest flaw in politics, without a doubt, has been the lack of clear rewards and punishments. Without rewards and punishments, there is no discipline, no right and wrong, and political efficiency is nearly zero. Consequently, the cunning foster cronies and engage in all sorts of deceit, while the weak follow the current, perfunctorily going through the motions. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Those with a little insight remain silent, seeing it as wise self-preservation. As a result, the path becomes increasingly blocked, and the light of dawn fades further. This kind of phenomenon, even in peaceful times, is a sign of national decline. How much more so in this decisive era of imminent crisis can we allow this great enemy of political reform—the absence of rewards and punishments—to persist? Driven by a fervent love for the government and a desire to protect the people's livelihood, we do not hesitate to speak out forcefully and make an urgent appeal: "China's national rejuvenation and the stability of the people's lives depend on political reform, and political reform must begin with clear rewards and punishments."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a government official is found to have committed a dereliction of duty, the government, at most, dismisses them to "settle" the matter, without investigating the scope of their responsibility for the dereliction, let alone meting out punishment or sentencing. If this is said to be proof of a complete purification of political corruption, we dare not utter such a self-deceiving falsehood.</p>
<p>We are unwilling to enumerate examples of the absence of rewards and punishments in current and past politics like displaying family heirlooms. We only want to point out two to illustrate our point:</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, it is said that after the recovery of Shanghai's concessions, the heads of two police stations, within ten days of taking office, engaged in corruption and bribery amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan. When their misdeeds came to light, they were merely dismissed from their posts. What happened to them after their dismissal, we have not heard. There's no smoke without fire. At the very beginning of Shanghai's unified administration, such corrupt elements have already infiltrated. We believe that dismissal alone is not enough. Their responsibility must be investigated and they must be punished according to the law, to serve as a warning to those who come after and to restore public confidence.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, the recent grain problem has become a complete mess. Since the transfer of authority from the Japanese-led Central China Rice Rationing Cooperative to the Chinese-led United Rice and Grain Corporation in early July, the public's expectations for the latter were ardent, seemingly from the bottom of their hearts. The reason for everyone's expectations seemed to be that after the Chinese took over, everything could be adjusted reasonably, and our own people would surely be more considerate of their own people. However, the reality of the past two months has been the opposite of expectations. The amount of rationed rice for households was already insufficient, and in these two months, there were either postponements or reductions. No explanation, no statement, could hide the shattered reality. The attempt to cover it up only made it more conspicuous, and the "reasons" became mistakes. Although the United Rice and Grain Corporation has now been abolished due to poor management and a new organization has taken over, how to reform and improve is a matter for the future, which we will not discuss for now. However, the United Rice and Grain Corporation and the responsible departments, such as the Ministry of Food and the Food Bureau, must not downplay their responsibility. If such an important matter of people's livelihood is treated irresponsibly, like child's play, handing it over to A today, who messes it up, without asking about right or wrong, and then handing it over to B tomorrow; and if B also messes it up, then wouldn't it still be without asking about right or wrong, handing it over to C the day after tomorrow? The government is not strict, the perpetrators are carefree, the people suffer, and the consequences are repeated at every level, without end. If we do not investigate A's responsibility today, without clear rewards and punishments, then how can we hold B responsible tomorrow, to make them vigilant about right and wrong and expect them to manage it well?</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to urge those who come after to reverse the mistakes of their predecessors, to be mindful of their responsibilities, and to strive for improvement. To do so, it is imperative to first determine the responsibility of those who came before and to punish them according to the law. The mismanagement of the United Rice and Grain Corporation clearly involved a small number of unscrupulous elements blinded by greed, engaging in corruption. It is widely rumored that these people used the pretext of the Japanese army needing military rice to buy rice from farmers in rice-producing areas at low prices. If there was any delay, threats would follow. In reality, the Japanese army's need for military rice has always been limited. The villagers or local township offices, threatened by the pretext of "military rice," were unable to resist and painfully handed over the goods. Therefore, the villagers' resentment was entirely directed at the Japanese army, leaving a deep impression. This behavior is not only self-serving and harmful to the public, endangering the people's livelihood, but also provokes the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, simply undermining the government's policy of peaceful movement, which is unforgivable offense number one. Secondly, after coercively buying grain at low prices, these people hoarded it, deliberately not transporting it to Shanghai for rationing. On the one hand, they smuggled a portion, using porters to sell it at black market prices. At the same time, they raised black market prices to pursue exorbitant profits. The malice in their intentions and the ruthlessness of their methods are infuriating. This behavior is undermining the foundation of the wartime economy and disrupting the peace and order of society, which is unforgivable offense number two. As for those who attribute the delays to transportation difficulties, the responsible authorities should also consider it a responsibility within their duties to negotiate with all parties and argue their case reasonably. We believe that our allies, based on the premise of Sino-Japanese cooperation, would not refuse or create difficulties. Therefore, the issue of transportation delays cannot be used as an excuse to evade responsibility. Even if it is a fact, it is still a failure to fulfill one's duties properly.</p>
<p>If the rumors are true, these unscrupulous elements are truly harming the nation, endangering society, and eroding the people's livelihood to the utmost. The responsible authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for failing to detect these activities. How can they simply resolve the matter with a dismissal? Can the nation's discipline and laws be treated as mere formalities?</p>
<p>We sincerely advocate that the government should emphasize political responsibility as the only key to reforming politics and improving the people's livelihood, and that it should use clear rewards and punishments to rectify discipline as a starting point. General and future political measures should be like this, and the current cases mentioned above should not be ignored. For the sake of the future of the nation, society, and the people's livelihood, we express our urgent expectation!</p>

<h3>Fourth Anniversary of the European War: The Pope Broadcasts a Speech, Once Again Appealing for Peace to the World</h3>
<p>Rome, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Pope Pius XII, marking the 1st as the fourth anniversary of the European War, broadcast a speech to the world at 1:15 PM on the Vatican Radio. The main points are summarized as follows: Before the start of the European War, I asked the heads of state and citizens of all countries to prevent the tragedy of war. Now the war has reached its most tragic point, and the animosity of the citizens of all countries has only increased. Whether the continuation of the war is rationally beneficial to all countries, and whether it is just in the humanitarian conscience of all Catholics, is a major question. All international treaties have been trampled upon, and at a time when national and national covenants cannot be fulfilled, the mutual trust of citizens has greatly diminished. Finally, the Pope blessed those who worked hard for peace and urged those engaged in war to listen to the voices of those trapped in destruction and sorrow, asking for peace, bread, and work.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Raid Berlin, Losing Forty-Seven Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch – The German Supreme Headquarters announced the following regarding the British aircraft bombing of Berlin at noon on the 1st: A large group of British aircraft attacked Berlin on the night of the 31st. They were repelled by German night fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery. Some areas of the city suffered considerable damage, and civilian casualties were minor. According to reports to date, the German forces shot down forty-seven British aircraft in this operation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch – London sources: Anti-Axis airmen were surprised by the large number of German fighters encountered upon returning from bombing Berlin on Tuesday. One airman said that the raid was a tense and thrilling air battle. From the time of crossing the sea to the time of returning, they were intercepted by German aircraft throughout the entire journey. One bomber was attacked three times. The first time by a Junkers 88, and the other two times by a single-engine aircraft. German aircraft suddenly attacked enemy aircraft, this time not using searchlights to search for enemy traces, but by aircraft dropping flares. One airman said that the brightness of the flares created a sheet of light on the road to Berlin.</p>
<h3>Southern Route of the German Army Successfully Breaks Through; Awaiting Opportunity to Counterattack; A Thousand German Aircraft Bomb Soviet Supply Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>The German military authorities announced in detail on the 1st that the German army had broken through the Soviet Union's important route at Taganrog. Although the Soviet mechanized units attempted to break into the central part of the surrounded German army with cavalry as a vanguard, the German tank units and anti-tank artillery destroyed twenty-five Soviet super-heavy tanks on the evening of the 30th. When they broke through the encirclement, they immediately turned to a fierce counter-attack. In addition to capturing more than a thousand Soviet troops, they completely annihilated a Soviet tank brigade. Yesterday, they joined the main force of the German army. Currently, the German army has completely blocked the Soviet army's advance with minefields and is waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch – German News Agency reported that fierce defensive battles continued near Seversk in the Kharkov area of the Eastern Front and the Gyrenka area. The Soviet army transferred reinforcements from the central and northern routes to join the battle. The Soviet army on the central Donets front also resumed its activities, concentrating several infantry divisions, several tank teams, and a large artillery team. The Soviet army apparently abandoned its intention to encircle the German divisions from the north and south and decided to launch another frontal attack. According to recent telegrams, the line in the Voroshilovgrad area has been shortened according to the original plan. At the same time, more than a thousand German bombers launched a concentrated attack on Soviet supply lines. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in this extremely destructive air raid. Hundreds of German main aircraft used fragmentation bombs and machine gun fire to bomb the Soviet offensive operations, resulting in the suspension of enemy activities in various strongholds.</p>
<h3>Quebec Conference: The Old Topic of Counterattacking Burma Resurfaces</h3>
<p>The Sixth Anglo-American Quebec Conference has reportedly completed its review of the political and strategic outlines for dealing with the Axis powers in the future global war situation. After thoroughly studying the information gathered from various sources, it is believed that during this conference, the United States opposed the British advocacy of "Europe First" and strongly advocated for prosecuting the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Differences</p>
<p>British newspapers emphasized the epoch-making importance of the Quebec Conference, stating that it should lead to a final decision on a strong assault on European mainland fortresses. On the American side, at the height of the conference on the 20th, Under Secretary of the Army Robert Patterson made a bold statement in Honolulu, saying, "In order to deliver a devastating blow to Japan, we are actively preparing to transport a large amount of equipment and supplies to East Asia." The United States is deeply concerned about Japan's increasingly strengthened defenses in East Asia. Differences between Britain and the United States regarding the allocation of combat power in the Eastern and Western war theaters remain unresolved.</p>
<p>According to numerous reports, within the United States, the view that "the Pacific war situation has been treated lightly, resulting in Japan's defenses becoming virtually impregnable, and future wars against Japan may involve extreme sacrifices" has recently gained traction. Furthermore, the initial view held by the general public at the beginning of the war, that "Japan is aware of the disadvantage of a prolonged war and hopes for a short, decisive battle," has now vanished. Even among American military experts, the general consensus is that "time is now working in favor of the Japanese military. Japan is currently making good use of the most valuable time." Because national affairs are dominated by public opinion, the American authorities, against the backdrop of increasing domestic anxiety, strongly demanded that the British side make detailed preparations for a Pacific counteroffensive during this conference, and promptly decide on the timing and location. British Minister of Information Brendan Bracken recently made a solemn declaration stating, "After Germany is defeated, Britain will certainly fully cooperate with Japan," in order to appease American "Pacific First" sentiments, but this is nothing more than an attempt to concentrate American combat power in order to implement the "Europe First" policy.</p>
<p>Repeated Delays</p>
<p>According to dispatches from Quebec, regarding the timing of opening a second front in the European theater, there is a plan to launch an attack before the end of the summer this year. Another view advocates focusing on bombing Germany in the winter this year and starting the attack in the spring of next year. The latter proposal would essentially postpone the landing operation until the spring of next year, sacrificing less and achieving greater success. If this proposal is implemented, it may provoke fierce opposition from the Soviet Union, which is demanding the immediate opening of a second front. As a result, the Quebec Conference did not reach a clear conclusion on the timing of intensifying the bombing of Germany and seizing opportunities to land on the European mainland as soon as possible. As for the landing sites, Italy and the northern and southern coasts of France are planned. However, it is rumored that the American authorities have been advocating for a decisive landing directly on the northern coast of France since the Fifth Conference. This is in order to end the European war as soon as possible and concentrate combat power towards the Pacific. From this, one can also get a glimpse of how anxious the United States is about the Pacific.</p>
<p>Although the United States is so deeply concerned, the "Europe First" strategy has not yet been abandoned. In reality, there is no need to examine and handle the world strategy in such a dichotomous manner. All efforts can be directed toward the Pacific, depending on the scale of the European war. For example, the simultaneous advancement of the Mediterranean offensive and the South Pacific offensive, as demonstrated after the Fifth Conference, may not be impossible. That is to say, the reason why the counteroffensive theory in Burma, with the Quebec Conference as a turning point, is being noticed is precisely because of this. At the Quebec Conference, Australia, which has a deep relationship with the Southwest Pacific, was not represented, while Song Ziwen, the representative from Chongqing, was quite active. Judging from the inseparability of aiding Chongqing and recovering Burma, the Burma campaign was clearly a central issue of this conference. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Quebec, the Burma campaign occupies the most important position in the anti-Axis East Asian strategy.</p>
<p>Counteroffensive Plan for Burma</p>
<p>General Montgomery of the British Eighth Army is highly favored as the commander of this operation. A Quebec dispatch from the Daily Mail also mentions the possibility of appointing American General Stilwell. From all this information, it is not difficult to imagine that a general plan for the Burma campaign has already been established at the Quebec Conference. However, the timing of its implementation is still subject to various rumors, and it seems to have been decided to wait until after the rainy season, from October onwards. It is difficult to predict what kind of tactics Britain and the United States will adopt to implement this counteroffensive, but the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Due to the treacherous terrain of Arakan, which prevents the large-scale movement of heavy artillery and armored units, a large-scale counteroffensive will first seize control of the sea and air in the Bay of Bengal and use naval vessels for landing operations. In this case, the naval aspect is expected to be dominated by the British Navy, with powerful fleets being transferred to East Asia. The American Navy, mainly consisting of aircraft carriers, will also participate.</p>
<p>In terms of air power, Under Secretary Patterson previously stated that China would be assisted as much as possible, so American aircraft will undertake significant tasks.</p>
<p>In terms of ground forces, Britain will transfer a portion from West Asia to this region, with the British Indian Army as the main force, and a large portion will be composed of American troops dispatched to India. The United States must send 200,000 to 300,000 new troops for this purpose.</p>
<p>The above is the "plan" determined at the Quebec Conference. Whether it will be "successful" is, of course, another question. (Reported by Sho: Excerpted from the August 25th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Establishment of Sino-Japanese Joint Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>The Committee to Investigate and Determine the Quality and Price of Purchased Yarn and Cloth Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday, Dividing into Three Sections for Investigation</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The National Commercial Control Association's Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth, in order to determine the quality and price of purchased yarn and cloth, has, in accordance with Article 5 of its organizational outline, hired experts in textile technology and those with experience in the yarn market as committee members to establish the Committee to Investigate and Determine the Quality and Price of Purchased Cotton Yarn and Cloth. The committee is divided into three groups: cotton yarn, grey cotton cloth, and processed cotton cloth, to investigate and determine prices separately. In order to unify the decision-making on prices and the steps for quality inspection, and to exchange opinions and conduct research, the office has jointly established the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee to Investigate and Determine the Quality and Price of Purchased Cotton Yarn and Cloth with the Investigation Committee organized by the Temporary Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. The joint inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at 304 Bubbling Well Road. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>In addition to Director Nie of the Office for Purchasing Yarn and Cloth and Director Masuoka of the Japanese Management Bureau for Yarn and Cloth attending to lead the meeting, the Chinese investigation committee members included Xu Xiuxiao, Ping Linbo, Mi Wenjun, Qin Defang, Wu Shiwei, Chen Shouyi, Yang Yuelin, Wu Xinqi, Ying Yuanzai, Gu Jialuo, Zheng Weizhang, Zhou Rongsun, Fang Jianping, Kuang Zhaolin, Guo Kang, Wu Mingyong, Ling Jianxin, Tao Shanzhong, and others, totaling nineteen people.

<p>Sectional Investigation</p>
<p>Chairman Nie introduced the Chinese committee members to the Japanese committee members. He then reported on the significance of establishing the joint committee. After passing the regulations, it was decided that the position of committee chairman would be held by Director Nie of the office, and the position of vice-chairman would be held by Director Masuoka of the Japanese bureau. It was also decided that the investigation and determination of the quality and price of purchased yarn would be divided into three sections: cotton yarn section, grey cotton cloth section, and processed cotton cloth section, to conduct research, inspection, and decision-making separately. Wu Shiwei was appointed as the head of the cotton yarn section, with Masamoto Masayoshi as the deputy head. Yang Yuelin was appointed as the head of the grey cotton cloth section, with Asazawa Hiroji as the deputy head. Ying Yuanzai was appointed as the head of the processed cotton cloth section, with Kamii Akiji as the deputy head. Each section will consist of four Chinese committee members and four Japanese committee members, who will jointly study and determine the varieties and prices of purchased yarn and cloth. Starting from today, each section will hold daily meetings to review and approve the matters. It is understood that the prices of various yarn and cloth types will be determined within a week, and purchases will be made based on this standard price.</p>
<p>Fire Insurance</p>
<p>After the National Commercial Control Association was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cloth within this city's districts, it was reported that the Taiping Insurance Company had sent a letter to the association authorities suggesting that it would be necessary to purchase fire insurance for the purchased yarn and cloth. More than ninety Chinese insurance companies in this city have formed four syndicates, and have requested that the representative companies of each syndicate handle the insurance. At the same time, it was also reported that the Central Trust of China had sent a letter stating that as a state-owned organization, it should also be given the insurance business. It is understood that because the amount of yarn and cloth purchased by the Commercial Control Association is extremely large, it has agreed with Taiping, Central Trust, and other companies to determine the responsible shares as follows: Taiping Insurance Company 40% (representing the Taiping Reinsurance Syndicate), Baofeng Insurance Company 20% (representing the Jiulian Reinsurance Syndicate), China United Assurance Society 20% (representing the Shanghai Reinsurance Syndicate), Central Trust of China 20% (of which 15% is distributed by Central Trust to China United Insurance Company for distribution to its affiliated companies).</p>
<p>The Office for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth has seen an increasing number of merchants and factories in the city coming to collect and submit sales applications. It is understood that in order to provide convenience to merchants and to speed up the work, the office hours will be specially advanced and extended from the 3rd to the 6th of this month, changing to 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, with the office groups working in shifts without rest. The office will also be open as usual on the 5th (Sunday). The deadline for submitting sales applications remains the 6th of this month and will not be extended.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Yuquan Explains Various Points</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has ordered the National Commercial Control Association to purchase existing cotton yarn and cloth in accordance with the promulgated Provisional Regulations for Purchase. However, merchants and factories in Shanghai have misunderstood the provisions of Article 3, Paragraphs 3 (Retailers) and 4 (Manufacturers) of the regulations during the period for supplementary registration and application for sale at the Purchase Office, and have dared to illegally dump or use the goods. Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry made a special statement in Shanghai yesterday to Chinese and Japanese reporters to explain the following: "The purpose of the government's implementation of the Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth is to thoroughly purchase the cotton yarn and cloth of both retailers and manufacturers. The yarn and cloth manufacturers will all have to close down. However, the government authorities are extremely concerned about the people's suffering and the actual needs of the people in order to stabilize their livelihoods. Therefore, there are provisos in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the regulations. Unfortunately, the merchants have not only failed to understand the provisions clearly, but have also acted illegally. Article 3, paragraph 3 of the regulations leaves room for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth from retailers. Paragraph 4 allows processing and manufacturing factories to continue manufacturing as usual. However, it is stipulated that the quantity of retail manufacturing shall not exceed the average monthly inventory and consumption quantity of the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). Otherwise, it will be considered illegal. In other words, if a retailer buys goods from others for retail, or a manufacturer buys goods from others for manufacturing, it is also illegal. If retailers and manufacturers claim that they are using their own inventory, but the quantity of retail and manufacturing still exceeds the average monthly quantity in the first half of the year, it is still illegal. It has recently been heard that since the promulgation of the Purchase Regulations and during the process of implementation, some merchants have been dumping goods at low prices, and some factories have been using goods at abnormal consumption rates. These are all illegal acts. The authorities will deal with their excess quantities according to law. The government has now ordered local governments and relevant agencies to conduct investigations and hopes that the people will cooperate with the government's established policies to curb such illegal activities. Another important issue is that during the period for announcing sales applications, Chairman Wang has also issued a statement stating that merchants who do not apply to sell their registered cotton yarn and cloth within the statutory period are resisting government policy, and the government will take strict action separately. As for unregistered yarn and cloth, they must also apply for sale within the statutory period, otherwise the government will confiscate the goods. Do not make mistakes and violate the law. The government's promulgation of the Purchase Regulations is fully consistent with the Regulations on Punishing Hoarding and does not conflict with it. Finally, there are two points worth mentioning: The government authorities hope that the distribution methods and purchase prices will be approved and announced by the Materials Review Committee within a short period of time. The government is considering appropriate measures regarding the insurance contract for cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers (the insured profit of the then-insured price and the current statutory purchase price)." Finally, Chinese and Japanese reporters raised several important questions, which Vice Minister Yuan answered one by one.</p>

<h3>Merger of Jing'an and Zhabei Police Forces: Interview with Inspector Todoro</h3>
<p>Concentration of Police Power in the First Police Department Simplifies Maintenance of Social Order. Datong News Agency: The Times reported that Inspector Todoro, Deputy Director of the First Police Department, told reporters from the Japanese Times yesterday that the merger of a portion of the city center with the Jing'an and Zhabei police forces into the First Police Department yesterday morning has centralized the authority of the police administration and simplified the maintenance of social order in these areas.</p>
<p>Unification of Police Administration to be Completed by Year-End. According to Mr. Todoro's explanation, the result will be to reduce the workload of each police department. The merging of the police forces of the First and Third Districts is the first step in completing the merger of the Western Special District and the First District. The tax license fees and other administrative measures of the two districts will continue to be implemented separately for the time being, but will be implemented before the end of this year. Increase in Salaries of Jing'an Police Officers. Mr. Todoro revealed that the issue of increasing the salaries of Jing'an police officers to be equal to those of the First Police Department is currently under discussion. Given the differences in the organizational structure and systems of the two districts, Mr. Todoro stated that they will be gradually reformed. The efficiency of the First District police force will be greatly improved after this expansion and merger. However, the implementation of a standardized working system will still take time.</p>
<p>Police Departments of Eight Districts to be Merged</p>
<p>Mr. Todoro stated that the police system of the former French Concession is different from that of the First District in all aspects and will be merged within three months. As for the police systems of Zhabei and the city center, they are village-style organizations, so there is no need to change them, as they are completely different from the urban police system.</p>

The aforementioned overdraft account will be established at the Central Reserve Bank upon the issuance of special fixed deposit certificates by the association in exchange for special fixed deposit certificates. The proceeds from the disposal of cotton yarn and cloth purchased by the National Commercial Control Association upon order will be collected by the Central Reserve Bank on its behalf and deposited into the association's overdraft account at any time.

<h3>Municipal Public Utilities to be Under Unified Management and Unified Issuance of Vehicle Licenses</h3>
<p>The municipal public utilities were previously managed by the Concessions. After the takeover of the First and Eighth Districts, regarding the public utilities within those districts, the Municipal Government has now explicitly ordered that they be directly managed by the Public Utilities Bureau for the sake of unification. The Bureau has already drafted a plan, and once approved, the takeover can be implemented. As for the various vehicle licenses in the city, before the takeover of the concessions, they were issued separately by the municipal and concession authorities. Now that both concessions have been taken over, and it has been stipulated that the public utilities of each district be directly managed by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, all vehicle licenses should naturally be issued in a unified manner. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau specifically convened representatives from the First and Eighth Districts to hold a meeting at the Bureau, seeking opinions from all parties. As a result, there was general agreement on the unified issuance of licenses, and the implementation date should not be far off.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>### Household Rice</h3>
<p>In the past two months, the distribution of household rice has been either delayed or reduced in quantity, further exacerbating the serious problem of grain, which is related to the people's livelihood. On this issue, we hear the public's voices in every corner, expressing either disappointment or resentment. Some even regret the misfortune after the takeover of the concessions. Therefore, we urge our compatriots not to be passively disappointed or resentful. We should rise to our responsibilities and actively urge the authorities to improve and adjust for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>The organization in charge of grain storage is about to be reorganized. We sincerely hope that the new organization will present a new image and truly solve the problems for the public. We have heard that fair and impartial people from society will participate in the selection of the leading personnel, which is even more cause for celebration.</p>
<p>However, according to rumors in the city, there are reports of increasing the price of household rice and purchasing surplus rice from the market. We believe this is inappropriate. First, the official price of household rice has a leading effect on various commodity prices. If the official price of rice rises, other commodity prices are likely to follow suit, which is obviously in conflict with the policy of suppressing price increases. Second, the current surplus rice in factories in the market is not comparable to hoarding for speculation. Most of it is purchased to supplement the insufficient household rice for workers. If it is purchased, unless the future allocation quantity is increased to the minimum sufficient amount, it will easily cause panic and lead to dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>We hope that the authorities will think from a proactive perspective, purchasing rice at reasonable prices in rice-producing areas, clearing transportation, ensuring smooth flow, absolutely ensuring timely distribution, and gradually increasing the quantity. This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>### Wait and See</h3>
<p>Interpreted in a positive light, "wait and see" is a manifestation of humility; interpreted in a negative light, "wait and see" is a manifestation of diffidence. Humility is nothing more than prudence, while diffidence is undoubtedly cowardice. Today, the Shanghai financial and commodity market is unanimously diffident, harboring a "wait and see" attitude, resulting in a lifeless atmosphere, which is a morbid state of diffidence. Diffidence leads to vacillation and weakness of will, and the manifestation of its behavior is: indulging in wishful thinking, readily believing rumors, and hesitating to move forward. The reason for this is insufficient understanding of the matter, and the result is self-deception.</p>
<p>What is self-deception? The purchase of cotton yarn will definitely not be postponed again. Those who "still harbor a 'wait and see' attitude, hoping for repeated postponements, will inevitably be punished." The prices of daily necessities are already declining due to the government's fixed-price purchase of cotton yarn. Those who are still waiting for a good price to sell daily necessities accumulated by the country will inevitably find themselves unable to sell. Financial institutions and wealthy individuals have already received serious lessons. Those who still cannot forget the loan profits and speculative interests of the past will inevitably achieve nothing. Are all of these not self-deception?</p>
<p>To avoid self-deception, one must correct today's "wait and see" attitude and actively engage in proper planning and reasonable management. The past is "like yesterday's death," and the future should be shifted to productive enterprises, either for investment or for savings, to replenish the capital of productive enterprises. This is the normal and reasonable approach.</p>
<h3>Local Products Like Bristles, Fur, and Hemp Listed as Major Commodities; Whether to Form Associations Awaiting Approval</h3>
<p>Regarding the question of whether local bristles should be included in the scope of control, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry for reply, stating that the Ministry's published list of major commodities largely follows the old system, and bristles are still not included. However, it has been found that the asphalt required for local bristle raw materials is one of the major commodities, and it will certainly be distributed in the future. Due to this relationship, it is indeed necessary to include local bristles as a major commodity, and this has been resolved through a resolution passed by the Commodity Control Review Committee. At the same time, it was resolved that materials such as hemp and its products, as well as hides and furs, should also be included as major commodities. As for whether to organize the relevant industry associations and which guild they should belong to, it is said that the relevant authorities are submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>President of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, Arrives</h3>
<p>Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, President of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, accompanied by his son, Mr. Mitsui Shigeru, arrived in Shanghai on the 1st to take office. On the 2nd, he visited the Embassy and various aspects of the Army and Navy, and at the same time began to negotiate personnel matters, etc. According to Mr. Mitsui's statement, "Having been entrusted with this important task, I will certainly do my best. I seek practicality and hard work in my work, and I do not like empty talk. Regarding the Trade Association, the most important thing is the preparation of personnel and organization. I am willing to fully listen to opinions from all parties before making decisions on other matters. The economic problems in Central China are extremely complex, so I hope for guidance from all parties. Although Hankou is also under our jurisdiction, I plan to first understand its outline in Shanghai before starting work there. Fortunately, Economic Minister Okuda and related individuals are here, so the work will surely proceed smoothly. I hope everyone will provide guidance and assistance at any time."</p>
<h3>Secondary Commodity Guilds to Establish Appraisal Committees</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last month, the Municipal Economic and Food Bureaus separately ordered various secondary commodity trade associations to reorganize and establish themselves within a time limit in order to meet the wartime economic system and seek the welfare of the industry.

However, the guilds have already launched the following tasks: investigating, researching, improving, rectifying, managing, and constructing; providing proof or commission to members; co-sponsoring industry education and other public interests; mediating various disputes between member companies and labor disputes; acting as commissioned by government agencies; researching the correction of members' business operations, and will separately establish evaluation committees to carry out evaluation work.</p>

<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially fell sharply, but suddenly rebounded around noon. Initially, the selling pressure was overwhelming, and the decline was very rapid. Later, it was learned that the Cantonese consortium absorbed a large amount of Wing On stocks, which brought up the rest. Wing On in the department store industry initially fell sharply due to the fatigue of the previous day, but then rose sharply, rebounding throughout the session, and by noon had completely recovered the initial decline.

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, they were initially weak but ultimately firm. The slump in stocks had a profound impact, resulting in a situation of less buying in the market. Around noon, due to temporary trading to cover short positions, there was a slight rebound. Overall, public bonds will temporarily remain weak because commodity prices are likely to continue to decline. Yesterday's various types of bonds were initially stable, but then generally weakened, slowly trending downward, and the final closing was slightly better than before noon. There was not much participation in the four types of A, B, D, and E.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Arrivals by land and water routes declined, and due to rain, both retail customers and brokers were inactive. People's confidence weakened, and the market was stable. As a result, late-season rice and new glutinous rice rebounded slightly. White rice had no honor or disgrace, and there was no market for the rest.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent 2: A School for Suffering Women - The Story of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians in China</h3>
<p>In recent decades, the Eastern countries have also made significant progress in industry. Unfortunately, the byproduct of the factory system, poor vagrant children, also abounds in major cities. And the suffering vagrant children caused by the Eastern feudal system and natural disasters and banditry are in urgent need of relief and education, which is more urgent and meaningful than in European and American countries. Therefore, in the past half-century, the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians have successively founded schools in India, Australia, and various parts of Southeast Asia. They have long had the desire to come to China to teach and help, but unfortunately they have not had the opportunity until 1923, with the development of the Salesians of Don Bosco, they urgently felt the need to establish the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians to educate the vagrant daughters of China. Therefore, they first established schools in Shao Guan (Qujiang) in the interior of Guangdong, and then developed to other places such as Lechang. Responding to the special cultivation and needs of various parts of China, in addition to running orphanages, primary schools, middle schools, normal schools, and craft institutes, they also set up nursing homes and disability homes. In recent years, under the leadership of the Chinese District President and Mother Superior, they have received enthusiastic praise from all walks of life in the local area. In the past 20 years, thousands of poor daughters have been successfully educated, and their contribution to society is truly immeasurable. In addition, general charitable undertakings, such as providing relief to the disabled, orphans, and the elderly, as well as providing medical care and medicine, can be described with a Chinese proverb, "A living Buddha in ten thousand households."</p>
<p>The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent in Shanghai was founded in early 1934 on Baoxing Road in Zhabei, using a small Western-style house belonging to the real estate department of the Xinhua Savings Bank as the convent site. At that time, Mr. Lu Bohong, who was enthusiastically promoting charity in Shanghai, ran the "Maternal Heart Hospital" in Baziqiao (now renamed Guangzhong Road), which was run by the nuns and mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, with an orphanage attached. The dignified courtyard and the grassy square were believed to be a permanent enterprise. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the Maternal Heart Hospital became a key stronghold for the Chinese and Japanese armies to fight for, and was concentrated by artillery fire. The nuns, doctors, patients, and orphans fled in panic in the artillery fire. In the past four years, the mountains and rivers have not changed, but the old site has become a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>At that time, all the foundations of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians were destroyed, and the nuns and mothers took refuge in the Xinzha Road Refugee Relief Center and the Luban Road Wounded Soldiers Hospital, fully fulfilling their responsibilities as religious people to help the distressed and rescue the endangered, with the doctrine of God's love for people, serving the refugees and wounded soldiers. For about six months. However, the cause of educating orphan girls has never been forgotten for a day. In 1938, they began to rent houses in Yangshupu Road, Fulan Road, to accommodate orphans after the disaster. Later, the Gu family in Huasheng Road voluntarily used their house for this purpose. However, in extraordinary times, when social order had not yet been restored, the nuns supported the cause of helping orphans and rescuing the needy amidst unexpected difficulties and dangers. When Mother Liang Lihua talks about it today, one cannot help but stand in awe.</p>
<p>The Enterprises and Personnel of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians in Shanghai</p>
<p>In 1939, Shanghai society gradually stabilized. However, the number of suffering children increased day by day, and the streets and alleys were filled with homeless children without education or care, urgently awaiting to be taken in and educated. And the sick children and babies who knocked on the door for help and were abandoned at the door were even more unbearable to ignore. In fact, all the courtyards were not enough to accommodate them, so more than eight acres of land were purchased opposite the Yangshupu Wu Road tram station, and a Western-style building was built first. Last year, another Western-style building was added to actively promote the cause of educating homeless orphan girls, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>The work of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, according to the late Mother Mary's teachings, lies in educating and training the general vagrant and helpless suffering girls, and handling various social undertakings. The main enterprises are orphanages, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, boarding houses for female workers, night schools for female workers' supplementary education, holiday schools, disability homes, family workshops, and practical schools. For general orphan children, they provide the basic knowledge of good citizens and learn crafts suitable for their temperament and talents, so that they can be self-reliant in the future, start a family, eliminate parasites from society, and cultivate new talents for the country. For general female workers and suffering women, they also do their best to provide opportunities for them to study and improve, recognize the true meaning and proper joy of life.</p>
<p>The current head of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent in Shanghai is Italian, Mother Superior Andrea, who also presides over the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians enterprises in the southern provinces of China. She often travels back and forth between Shanghai and Guangzhou. Now, due to the war and inconvenient transportation, she has not visited Guangdong for several years. Although she maintains contact through correspondence, when she talks about it, the Mother Superior almost sheds tears, mentioning the long-separated brothers and sisters. Under the Mother Superior, there are several Vice Mothers, one Irish Mother, one Portuguese Mother, and twelve Chinese Mothers. Although Mother Liang Lihua is young, her religious cultivation, courageous attitude, and ability to handle affairs are typical of the Mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians. She often asks local benefactors, enthusiastic gentlemen and ladies, and social education experts for material and spiritual assistance for the cause of raising orphan girls with Mother Superior Andrea or Mother Jiang. In this difficult era, this kind of fundraising work is naturally even more difficult, and they work hard and sacrifice for good deeds, and they always show smiling faces. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>Opinions on Advocating the Establishment of Consumer Cooperatives for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>First</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jiang Tong advocated the organization of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, there have been many articles in the newspapers about organizing the cooperative. Everyone also has feelings about it, so I will present my humble views as follows:</p>
<p>The establishment of consumer cooperatives is a popular thing. At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls, it is even more beneficial to teachers and staff who are in the poorest class. Therefore, the key to the organization of the consumer cooperative for teachers and staff now is how to promote its early realization.</p>
<p>The organization of the consumer cooperative for teachers and staff must obtain the assistance of the school authorities, students' parents, and all sectors of society. However, the cooperative itself must have an independent and solid organization. The responsibilities of the administrators must be clearly defined. The administrators may be appointed by the school authorities, and their work in the cooperative is the same as working at school, and their salaries are collected from their original schools at their original salary amounts. The number of administrators depends on the needs of the cooperative. The number of people to be sent out by each school depends on the scope or ability of each school.</p>
<p>The distribution of goods does not have to be based on schools as units, nor does it have to be distributed by each school itself. Several distribution points can be set up, and the location can be selected in more spacious schools in the city. Please set aside a considerable location as the office, and the stationed staff does not have to be the staff of the school. The distribution of goods must be evenly distributed. It must be ensured that members living in any corner of the city can walk no more than a short distance to purchase goods without wasting time. The amount of goods stored at each distribution point depends on the area under its jurisdiction, or some items can be purchased at one time and used for one month or half a month, and special regulations can be made for distribution at the general office.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief overview of what I can see. As the consumer cooperative is a kind of organization that is most suitable for the times, the organization of the cooperative has already become a practical issue, and it does not seem appropriate to spend more time on theoretical discussion. If it can be established one day earlier, the teachers and staff will benefit one day earlier, which is also beneficial to education. (Chen Qian)</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jiang Tong's article "The Establishment and Content of the Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff," we deeply admire Mr. Jiang's foresight. The ten articles of organization published by Mr. Jiang are generally without much problem; however, I would like to express some humble opinions on the implementation methods after the organization:</p>
<p>Registration: After being presided over by reputable and impartial people in the education sector, register and recruit members immediately by advertising in the newspapers, which will be handled voluntarily by the responsible persons of each school, in order to save procedures.</p>
<p>Investigation: All investigators should go to each school to closely check the correct number of members and family members, and should not listen to the reports of the responsible persons of each school, because there may be false reports, etc.</p>
<p>Procurement: When members purchase in bulk directly from various producing areas, there must be many difficulties. Therefore, we should cooperate closely with the authorities to reduce troubles.</p>
<p>Distribution: The distribution situation should be determined according to the level of position and the amount of income. For example, university professors should be allocated one dou of rice per month per person, middle school teachers should be allocated one dou and five sheng, and elementary school teachers should be allocated two dou, and other items should be distributed in the same way.</p>
<p>Fees: If it is inconvenient to collect fees, they can be temporarily delayed, and deducted from the responsible person's salary in the following month. (Cheng Qichang)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Convent (Continued from Page 3)</h3>
<p>"Turn left and right!"</p>
<p>On the grassy field under the morning sun, two teams of female athletes are doing morning exercises under the direction of the nuns and mothers of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, which is lively, neat, tense, and serious. Even some schools' formal military training is not as moving. After the exercise, the children surrounded the mothers, talking about something. After a while, there was a burst of applause, overflowing with affection and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In the classrooms of the fifth and sixth grades, a group of students are working quietly. On the blackboard is the essay topic "Summer Vacation Life." The nun gently explains to a few students. The other classrooms are being cleaned and prepared during the summer vacation. The pictures of the Virgin Mary and the knowledge charts of various subjects, and the simple and alarming maxims, give people a deep impression. The school building is newly built, and the style and structure are suitable for the actual needs of modern education. The light, air, and internal layout evoke a sense of brightness, refreshingness, and excitement.</p>
<p>The Jiling Girls' School specializes in accepting girls from poor families in the neighborhood, providing them with the necessary knowledge of modern citizens, and preventing them from being infected by the corrupt and evil thoughts and habits of society in a poor and dirty environment, recognizing the proper meaning of life, and finding their own bright future. The level is the same as that of ordinary complete primary schools, divided into six grades. There are more than 160 students in the first semester, and many people have already registered for the second semester. In the faculty office, a large batch of "nationally designated" textbooks is being processed and sorted out, and it is almost time for school to start.</p>
<p>The 26th People's Night School attached to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is funded by the "Municipal Education Bureau" and specializes in accepting female workers and teaching them popular supplementary education. There were 100 students in the first semester, but female workers have their own special environment and difficulties, such as being burdened by assisting with housework, etc. If their interest in learning cannot be aroused, and they are not made to urgently feel the need to come to school to study, they often start enthusiastically, but slowly there is a phenomenon of dropping out of school. Therefore, it is necessary to study the appropriateness of the curriculum and content to the needs of female workers, and the improvement of teaching methods.</p>
<p>One characteristic of the educational enterprise of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians is that they are responsible for the students. Not only are they serious and strict during the teaching time, and pay equal attention to knowledge teaching and character training, but they also pay close attention to the future of the girls. For those who have dropped out of school and are poor and helpless, they can find appropriate jobs for them. There are now as many as 58 people who have been introduced to work at the Ke Fa Pharmaceutical Factory.</p>
<h3>Orphanage, Qingli Yuan, Free Clinic</h3>
<p>Orphanages and nurseries are the fundamental work of the Salesian Sisters, and they were first established in Shanghai. Unfortunately, they were completely destroyed during the Shanghai war. Later efforts were made to restore them, but due to limited space and funds, the scale was small. Currently, there are over forty orphaned girls, the younger ones being five or six years old, receiving kindergarten education, and the older ones being over ten years old. In addition to general national education, they are also given vocational skills necessary for making a living. They are currently divided into departments such as weaving, tailoring, cooking, knotting, and mending. The weaving room has several sock-knitting machines, textile knitting machines, and yarn-winding machines. The girls are busy working. Shelves are stacked with finished socks, sweaters, and mended woolen clothing. The tailoring department is equipped with sewing machines and ironing equipment. A foreign "Mumu" (Sister) is teaching the girls how to work, mending Western suits and shirt collars and cuffs for others. The children are all happily busy, some already seventeen or eighteen years old. Presenting some of their work results makes every visitor feel satisfied. The "Mumu" says: When they leave the orphanage, they will not become homeless idlers but will become productive members of society.</p>
<p>Qingli Yuan is a type of institution founded by Father John Bosco that deserves special introduction among the children's educational undertakings. Every holiday or festival, many students have nothing to do at home and no guidance, so they just wander around the neighborhoods; or they do useless and harmful things; and there are also many naughty children who have been out of school, wandering the streets, and never receiving human love and cultural influence. Qingli Yuan specifically opens its doors to these children, allowing them to enter, freely attend lectures in classrooms, participate in internships in workshops, exercise in sports grounds, or engage in collective games in playgrounds, ensuring that the children feel the freshness, vitality, and loveliness of Qingli Yuan life and no longer wander the streets or set foot in inappropriate places. The Salesian Sisters in Shanghai also run Qingli Yuan, but the previous facilities have been destroyed by war and are awaiting social support for their restoration work.</p>
<p>In addition to the educational undertakings for children, the Salesian Sisters do not neglect social charity, especially striving to relieve the diseases of the poor. Although funding is extremely difficult now, they still operate a free clinic on Songpan Road, providing free diagnosis and medication. For extremely poor patients, it is completely free, and those who voluntarily pay only give a few cents. The outpatient department is managed by a Sister who graduated from the Red Cross Hospital and has rich medical knowledge and experience. The clinic provides services from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. every day. In the past year, it is said that the number of patients seen has exceeded four thousand. Currently, apart from the Kefah Pharmacy donating medicines one day every Christmas, other major pharmacies such as Zhongsi and Jicheng donate monthly or periodically. However, the amount needed to purchase additional medications is still around one thousand yuan per month.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Convent Life</h3>
<p>At the gate of the Salesian Sisters convent and along the nearby roadside, there are often abandoned babies. Some parents are too poor and have too many children to raise, some are sick and unable to seek medical treatment, or believe that there is no hope for a cure. When the Sisters see this, they naturally cannot be without compassion, so they have always tried their best to rescue them. They raise the healthy ones to the best of their ability. They try their best to treat the sick, and bury the dead by preparing coffins. Among them, due to limited funds, they are unable to take in all of them, so they help transport them to the Xujiahui Orphanage or the Xin Puyu Hall in Nanshi, but most of them are adopted as much as possible, caring for them like their own daughters and sisters.</p>
<p>There are now over fifty orphans and homeless women at the Salesian Sisters, but strangely, everyone is healthy and lively. According to the Superior Sister, although the Association's funding is difficult, the Sisters pay very close attention to the orphans' lives, nutrition, and health. As she spoke, she rushed to their kitchen. The Sister lifted the lid, and the aroma of red rice immediately wafted out. Next to it, in the pot, pumpkins that they had grown themselves were being cooked. Dozens of eggs were stacked in the gauze cabinet, and there was also fresh beef. Several orphaned girls were practicing cooking, and under scientific facilities, not even a fly could get in. It is said that although the Sisters often go hungry to solicit donations, they strive to maintain the orphans' temporary meals; twice a month, they can solicit vegetables worth four or five hundred yuan from the Central Market at Garbage Bridge, and three times a month, they can solicit vegetarian food worth one or two hundred yuan from the Hongkou vegetable market. However, rice for more than fifty people has become a major problem, and the household rice ration is insufficient; recently, concerns have increased even more. And rice cannot be obtained through donations.</p>
<p>The laundry room and the bathroom are not very large, and there are no new modern scientific facilities. The bathroom only has a hot water stove and a stack of large and small tubs arranged like a pagoda. But it is very clean, and there is also a Sister in charge of management. Most of the children's clothes are donated by the Sisters from all walks of life, and after modification, they are all clean, simple, and fitting, without any appearance of the poverty of orphaned girls. However, the clothes or fabrics donated recently have become increasingly scarce, and there may be a clothing shortage soon! The Sisters are worried.</p>
<p>The second floor is the "Novitiate," which is a training center for successors to the Salesian Sisters' work, specializing in accepting female believers who are passionate about religion, understand and have faith, and are determined to sacrifice and serve in the work of educating orphaned and wandering girls. They must have at least a high school diploma to be accepted. The curriculum of the Novitiate, in addition to knowledge of the Bible and religion, mainly focuses on the knowledge and skills of educating wandering and suffering girls. Usually, after two years of training and a considerable period of practice, they are given the honorary title of "Mumu." After entering the convent, they pledge to sacrifice their lives to serve poor women and religion and can never return to their families, but their families can still visit and shake hands and chat. The spiritual joy gained from sacrificial service cannot be compared to the happiness of ordinary families. Only when this good cause is in a difficult situation due to financial exhaustion and is on the verge of being unable to be maintained, and seeing a group of orphaned girls feeling that their future is uncertain after being educated, the Sisters, when they talk about this, unknowingly shed a few tears!</p>
<p>The orphans' bedrooms are currently using three classrooms due to the summer vacation, separated according to age. But universally there are beds for one or two people, mosquito nets and other supplies, neatly clean and quiet. Little sparrows chirped and jumped at the window. The sunlight shone on the statue of the Virgin Mary hanging high in the bedroom, emitting a soft glow. Every night before going to bed, they sincerely pray under the statue of the Virgin Mary. They thank the generous donations of enthusiastic people and philanthropists in society, and bless them and their health and success in their careers. The Sister says: The Association's funding comes mostly from donations from all walks of life in the Bund, and the shortfall is subsidized by the Italian Salesian Sisters. Since December 8th of the year before last, the source of donations in this city has decreased, and foreign subsidies have stopped. This year, they requested a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. After investigation by the committee members, they believed that the management was perfect, and the financial situation was difficult and should be maintained. They once subsidized 4,500 yuan, and recently, in late August, they continued to subsidize 4,500 yuan. However, daily expenses are rising with commodity prices, requiring at least 10,000 yuan per month, and it has now reached a difficult situation that cannot be maintained. The Sisters and orphans can only pray sincerely, hoping for assistance from society. On their donation book is inscribed a radiant golden sentence from the Bible:</p>
<p>"Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</p>
<p>(Matthew 25:40) (End)</p>

<h3>Chinese Health Association Actively Promotes Healthcare Work Seeking Priority Memberships from the 1st</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Health Association has spared no effort in promoting healthcare work. The Association is a large-scale medical service organization that gathers the public, physicians, and hospitals to carry out disease prevention work for citizens. It invites specialist physicians from various departments to provide services, conducts health visits, and formulates a ten-year healthcare plan for gradual implementation. The Association is seeking priority members starting from September 1st. Membership fees will be halved for those who join within one month. People from all walks of life can join voluntarily to enjoy free X-ray examinations and free vaccination injections, as well as other benefits. However, the Association does not send personnel to contact people outside. The Association's address is located at 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Meiqi Building. The constitution can be found there.</p>
