<p>星期社論</p>
<h3>水電煤氣限制意見</h3>
<p>— 喬木</p>
<p>本市各公用事業公司，爲應付非常環境，並節省燃料，自十二月一日起對於水電煤氣用量加以限制，核減的成數，視用途而加以區別，自一二成至四五成不等，用戶用量減少，公司營業收入當亦隨之減少。如非迫於環境，各公司決不出此。所以，我們希望全體用戶，都能認清環境，對於各公用事業公司不得已的措置，充分予以合作。但是在辦法方面，卻不能不貢獻幾點意見。也盼當局能予以考慮採納。</p>
<p>此次各公用事業公司訂立限額，除法商甯車電燈公司及上海瓦斯會社巳正式登報公告，詳列限制辦法，俾用戶知所運守外，用戶數目最多的上海電力公司，至今尚米止式公告，究竟所訂的辦法是否與外傳完全相符，用戶苦乏標準，無從自加限制。但是所傅的愈額罰金數目又相當的大，萬一發生逾額受罰情事，就難保用戶不以此爲口實，與公司發生爭執。因此上海電力公司殊有及早正式公佈限制詳細辦法，以避免將來糾紛之必要。</p>
<p>根據過去經騐，各公司加價雖均規定於某月份起實行，但是上月份抄表以後的用量，向未分開各別計算，因爲加價的數目究竟爲數尚微，所以用戶都不甚措意。此次規定逾限罰金爲數甚鉅，假使有人係在上月二十日抄表，則本月所餘之日數僅有一月三分之二，無論如何嚴加限制，亦難恰符限額。且新訂辦法旣規定於十二月一日實行，即不應溯及旣往，以免用戶無辜受罰。所以我們主張十一月份抄表後之用量，與十二月份之用量，應該各別計算，分開賬單，以昭公允，而免使多數用戶俱有逾額被罰之可能。</p>
<p>新訂限制辦法，規定電燈用戶無論以往用電多寡，一律核減爲八九十三月中最高一月用量百分之七十（上海電力公司），或百分之六十五（法商電燈公司），我們認爲如此籠統規定，不甚合理。因爲平日浪費電流者，現在雖减去百分之三十（或三十五），仍可不受影響。可是平日已極端節省，僅肚至最低限度者，實國節無可節。兼顧辦法，似應由兩公司按照用戶電表安培數，規定用幣最低限度，以資救濟。</p>
<p>公司通告中頗有欠明瞭費解釋者，如瓦斯會社通告新限制額甲項，規定新限制額以一二三月消費量之平均數爲準，而分別用途比例減除之。但是乙項又規定最小限制額爲一三○單位，假定某烹飪用戶一二三月之平均消費量爲一○○單位，將依照甲項規定比例減除爲八○單位呢？還是依照乙項規定增加至一三○單位呢？或以不滿最小限制而竟可無須減除呢？意義不明，在用戶固有因誤解而逾額受罰之可能，在公司恐亦難免不因此增加糾紛。明臼解釋公開宣佈：似不容緩。</p>
<p>用水的多寡，於清潔衛生大有關係，從公共衛生立塲言，除有水荒情形以外，限制用水是絕對不應該的一件事。何況水廠燃料的消耗，遠非電廠可比，更何況同一市區，爲什麼一區的市民不受限制，八區市民要受限制。這一點不但要請法商電車電燈公司注意，更希望市政當局也加注意。</p>
<p>對於生產事業的用電，在戰時增產的意義下，不能限制的，我們同意於中報本月三B短評的選種主張。共次，煤斤來源的疏通，爲根本問題，各當局尤應竭力籌劃的。</p>
<p>最後還有一電，公用事業係屬專利獨占性質，所以各國定例；公用事絲凡修改營業章程與市民利審有關者，必須經過市議會通過，市政機關正式核准，此次本市各公用事業公司改訂限制辦法，對於主體的市政機關核准手續似有忽略，我們也覺得不無遺憾。</p>

<h3>日大本營昨發表已佔領常德縣城　作戰報道班長發表談話</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　據常德四臼電，常德渝軍經日軍猛攻，死守該地一週後，於三日晨揮白旗投降。至此常德縣城已被日軍完全佔領。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日四時發表，帝國陸軍部隊自十一月二日起，對渝軍第六戰區開始進攻作戰，予該戰區淪軍以澈底打擊，已於三日十一時，將常德縣城完全佔領。該作戰開始以來，迄十二月一日之主要綜合戰果（常德縣城攻略戰戰果不在內）如次：　渝軍損害、我方收容之渝尊屍出，計一萬八千四百九十七長、俘虜三千三百六十一名，擊落渝機十四架，鹵獲大砲七十四門，槍械三千二百七十五挺。　我方損害，陣亡五百五十六名。</p>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　據華中日軍前綫某地電，日華中方面作戰軍報選班班長，發表談話，說明日軍攻佔常盤之意義。其大意謂，日軍已於三日晨攻佔湘省要衝常德，渝軍前爲盡力防衛當德，曾將常德縣各機關學校工廠敎黨及住宅要塞化。渝軍之頑抗，在中國戰綫之戰史上，實屬罕見。今日一舉將其覆減而佔領之，可謂已粉碎渝方抗戰思想。其在軍事上，政治上，經濟上，及心理上，影響渝方者實深。日軍開始作戰以來，為時僅三旬餘，即殲滅渝軍第二綫兵團。常等作戰，雖為此次作戰中之一戰門而已，但日軍已在沅扛河畔擊潰渝方重軍，其意義實極重大。於此可見臼戴對攻城野戰綜合戰術之巧妙也。戰局之前半期已過，而週至第二階段，因此次作戰之成功，與臼軍之敢鬥，戰局益形擴大。</p>
<p>進攻內地作戰，正敢議偉大之戰果，爲慶方面，自製失第六零區後，於窮困之餘，復動員第九戰區之兵力，以圖有逞。但此種舉動，唯予日軍以減滅之機會。日軍對新動員之淪軍，當即予以　懲，其被殲之時當在不遠。</p>
<p>漢口四日中央社電據　華中日軍前綫某地電。日軍頃在常德附近邀擊從第九戰區北上救援常德之渝軍，收獲莫大戰果，是役日軍部隊曾在曾家集西北方國攻渝軍第1百九十師主力，及第十師一部，第三百八十五師一團等約五千人，予以澈底打擊。計淪軍遺屍約二千具，日軍截獲迫擊砲重機關槍等無算。淪一百九卞師師長朱嶽中彈陣亡，該師長勤務兵亦被日軍俘虜。據述此次作戰情況稱，當渝軍被日軍包園之時，師長早有退卻之意，後以一部抵抗日軍，掩護師團司令部後退，但爲時已晚，日軍砲彈已級殺選於師團司令部附近，師長甫機動身，即中彈陣亡。按在此次作戰中，渝軍師長之陣亡者已右四人。</p>
<h3>檢閱蘇淮靑少年　林宣部長抵徐</h3>

<p>（又電）國府宣傅部長林柏生氏，二日午抵徐後，略事休息，乃於二時三十分訪問行政公署。嗣由高宣傅處長陪同訪問日軍師團部，臼本總領事館，述絡部憲兵隊等種關。</p>

<p>柏林四日中央社電　據海通社訊：東綫近日來之戰事並無改變，氣候惡劣足以影響戰事之進行，尤以南路之大雨未止，但蘇軍仍繼續進攻聶伯河套，克里曼卓格西南有劉戰，契爾喀賽區之激戰亦在進行中，局勢略有改變。戈美爾區之蘇軍巳將選攻之中心，移至斯學倫斯克至奧爾廈間之公路上，集中於該處之蘇軍約有步兵三十師以上。再向北，德軍在尼維爾西南與西方正在反攻中。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德軍界人士評論東綫之軍事爲勢宜稱：蘇軍雖塲續其不斷變更焦點之戰術，但在聶伯河區四十天之戰役，迄未有所成就。星期四日除克果曼卓格西南之戰事外，蘇軍並發動新攻勢，以爭取斯摩倫斯克以西之公路。基輔區之戰綫，現已失法其一部份之重要性，該慮戰事之經弛，大半由計天氣情形不良，而致地上泥濘難行之故。蘇軍拄貝爾種普地峽西部之强大攻勢已被擊退，同時德軍在克森區內獲得若干勝利。尼科波爾區與克里伏洛格區因天氣嚴寒之故，僅有有限之活動，但契爾喀賽區之重大戰爭，則仍在灌續進行。蘇軍在斯　倫斯克之西一區，集中軍隊達三十一師團之多，於此可見該處戰事之劇烈。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據海通社訊：德國外部發言人昨稱，英方所傳士耳其早臼參戰之消息，爲片面之思想。柏林政界方面最近對土耳其報界屢作聲明稱、勸誘土耳其參戰並無此意云。</p>
<h3>圖剌羅斯福　瘋漢被捕</h3>
<p>日內瓦四日中央社電　德國新聞訊：美聯邦偵查局探員曾於上月問捕獲一圖謀暗殺羅斯福之瘋人，其人爲柏斯得，三十八歲，將被監禁。柏氏逗留於華盛頓二日，即於十一月十三日被捕。渠曾函其妻表示欲除羅氏之意。嗣後渠述說渠進入白宮之經過，據稱，當自富衛兵正在由卡車上卸貨忙碌時，渠正思想可否奪衛兵之槍以遂其願，即爲衛兵所發現。</p>
<h3>美鐵路員工　醖釀總罷工</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城四日中央社電　據華盛頓來電美鐵路職工現正醖釀總罷工。鐵路車務員組成之五　愛會幹部，已定於十一日假俄亥俄克利央蘭開會，表決何時開始總罷工，司爐司機友愛會代表羅特　三日談稱，現公會所屬職工正投票表決是否總罷工，至十二日即可決定，其贊成罷工者必甚多。</p>
<h3>亞特里亞海北部　掃蕩戰終了　德軍固守義山區陣地</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據柴格勒布來電：傳軸心軍於亞特里亞海北部，展聞之掃蕩戰已終了，己完全確保該水城。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據海通社訊：英第八軍在義國戰綫之地位迄未改善，英美軍之左翼尚未發動攻勢，蒙高茂萊將軍之部隊對接近海岸之山區毫無進展。西路戰事之重趨激烈，與美第五軍對德軍陳地集中堅强之砲火，證明艾森霍華將軍已下令克拉克將軍開始進攻。東路之戰事中，證實德軍作戰之經騐，並不因敵軍數量之衆多而被掩沒，敵軍在叢山區域出動大量之轟炸機與坦克車殊鮮效力，德軍之反攻予英軍第八軍以重大之損失，故該軍在山區並無寸進。最近氣候轉好，雙方空軍數爲活動·對敵方之給養綫與交通中心互施襲率，德機空襲巴里甚爲得手。</p>
<h3>美軍傷亡數　現逾十二萬名</h3>

<h3>反軸心陣營　弱點暴露　巨頭會議顯無成就</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據海通社通訊員費師爾種：由可靠方面透露，關於反軸心國三巨頭在伊朗某處之曾議，顯見英美計劃之續遭挫折，大慨邱吉軍與羅斯福將於其同國時，在某處勾留，藉以討論會讀之結果，無論如何英美二領袖之長途跋涉，至中東某處與斯達林會議，置大失聲望，柏林官方認此事爲英美依賴蘇聯之最倖證據。</p>
<p>土政界觀感</p>
<p>土京四日中央社電　據海通社訊：羅斯福邱吉爾斯達林刻在進行會談1事，極引起此間政界人士之注意。據最近所獲之情報，斯達林自始即表明須在蘇聯利益範圍內之某地，始能與羅邱二氏會晤，故曾拒絕前往開羅，並建讓德無蘭或大不里市爲舉行會議地點。此問人士預料開於歐洲戰後邊　之政治問題，當不致提出討論，關於羅斯福邱吉爾蔣介石舉行開羅會議後所發表之官報，亦爲此間政界人士所注意。半官機關「烏魯斯報」評曰，美國顯有稱霸大平洋之野心，該報並認爲澳大利亞未正式參加開羅會議，頗堪注意，重慶對問羅會議之結果似亦表不滿，此間渝駐土大使館發言人並已力言官報措詞，並未與重慶會同起草。蔣介石夫人在開羅會議中任通譯，其譯述曾受英方之嚴厲檢查，聞蔣夫人曾向英當局提出抗議。</p>
<p>英與情不滿</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電據海通社訊，倫教息：英國公衆對開羅會蟻決議案之不滿益形增加，若德黑蘭會議再無滿意之結果。則邱吉爾返至英國時，將不受人民之歡迎。「瑞典晚報」稱，倫敦入民現開始認知開羅會議決議案之公布露極大之失策，蓋反軸心國對日本之企爾，僅足以增加日德兩國之抵抗力，此外開羅公報中無具體之計劉．亦遭請重之功擊。依倫敦方面之意見，反軸心團當起草東亞　家將來之建設計劃，以為日本「東亞共榮國」之對策，至少對東亞國家在政治上之獨立性與經濟上之發展，應予以保證。英國保守黨刊物「觀察者報」對反細心國之政策，挾學不遺餘力，尤其在歐洲之政策，反足以證實德國所稱「反軸心國作戰之目的在毀減德國」之口號。</p>
<h3>瑞士將與蘇聯　成立外交關係　蘇捷公約內容透露</h3>
<p>巴塞爾四日中央社電　據海通社訊：瑞士「巴塞爾國民新聞」昨稱，瑞士將與蘇聯成立外交關係。此項消息之來源，根據瑞士談會外交委員會最近開會時討論「與各列强成立正常之外交關係」之事實。該報續稱，瑞士經濟界已對蘇聯探取更緩和之態度，兩國間之商務關係已在準備中。</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據海通社訊：倫敦之捷東流亡政府外部星期五透露即將簽訂之蘇捷公約內容，該約共有五條：日蘇捷互相保證對德及其盟國之戰事將繼續。　蘇捷保證互助，及對將來德國右害兩國之行動採取共同行動。　戰後經濟合作。　變方均不得干涉對方之內政。　邀請與蘇聯或捷克昆鄰之歐洲各國參加此項公約。</p>

<h3>寄美國國民</h3>
<p>— 野村吉三郎</p>
<p>波根維爾大捷聲中，大東亞戰爭已經二周年了。當去年一周年紀念日，我們曾說昭和十八年（即一九四三年）是未來的決戰年，現於所羅門進行中的日美間大會戰。實是那決戰的最高潮。我們的邀擊固極銳利，但敵方的反攻亦愈來愈烈，被我的形勢，日益嚴重。茲有前駐美大使，右終會員，野村吉三郎海軍大將；以「寄美國國民」一文投本社（讀賢報知）。該文一面囘顧二年前的十一月二十日至二十六日問日美交涉最後卒致決裂的經遇；一面在機觀目前捷報頻傳的現戰局中，指出羅斯福所抱制霸世界的野心，及其與美國國民生活感情之可驚的矛盾。而所羅門的致命傷，實即務美國國民應靜思那矛盾的唯一機會，而在日本，一億國民因這一役使「決戰年」飛躍至「勝利年」的絕好機會。</p>
<p>看到以所羅門爲中心時最近戰局，雖屢戰陽北，仍未出擊的美國之冒險的戰爭，首先浮到我腦海中的，乃是八月的奈貝克會談之決定。那會談中。英美問開始具體的討論關於攻擊日本之共同的作戰計劉。這從當時邱吉爾的言論中也可以如道。所羅門方面戰開之頓告積極化，即爲其表現之一。</p>
<p>太平洋第一主義，或歐洲第一主義，以前一直爲美國議論的中心，當有人主張美國擔任太平徉，英國則分擔大西譯和地中海．奎貝克會　中，更從此前進一步，英美兩團拄對日攻擊上，不單是戰爭目的，即關於太平洋的作戰目標，也決定密切合作。自從英國的任命　特巴　起，以至地中海艦隊的向印度洋方面調動、美國海軍以大規模艦隊向拉蒲爾方面集虫等。這些都有着決不能個別考察的聯帶關係。開戰之初日本海軍在珍珠灣及　來海戰中所加的打擊，粉碎了太平徉水域上英美的組帶，切斷了所調對日包國陣的鐵環。現在，奎貝克會談中所決定的英美的新對日反攻計劉、在其即將寶行之先，在所羅門又遭挫折，此衣所羅門的日本大戰果，在種種意義上是極重大的，直今後的影饗亦極深刻。美國國民。趁此機會，必須再一次好好地記億着：一旦奠定的東亞磨石之安的戰略態勢，是如何的强勒英美在東西　動欲衝破這外綫，是如何的無理：</p>
<p>美國對於用獨力以和日本交戰，自始即完全沒有自信。美國知道如不利用重發的力量，如不借重英國的力量，在亞洲和日本戰爭，完全沒有勝算。這留在以後詳述。我曾任駐美大使，擔任打開日美關係的交涉，當時無論就軍備而言，就將士的士氣而言，就國民的準備而言，就日本在東亞之地理的立塲而言，美國的指導者們比任何國家知進得詳細，日本是世界上最可怕的敵人，唯1的物資生產办這一點，他們看到日本在這襄有着弱電，但他們也並不以爲獨力可以打倒日本。而且這在開戰後難道一點也沒有變更嗎？寶際上，由於日本陸海軍的办量。正在積極完成來亞穩固的戰略態勢。美國國民不能不更進一步認識這情勢。</p>
<p>歐洲方面、自巴陀里奧義政權投降之後，英國在地中海的海上勢力綽有餘裕。但美國的國內情形，不容戰爭長期繼壞下去。戰爭愈拖延下去，日本的戰力祗有意加强盛，如是，奎貝克曾談乃決定大規模的英美的大平徉反攻策，現在以所羅門，新幾內亞方面爲中心的敵方作戰，頓趨活潑。一面等待着從印度洋方面而來的英國助力，是以今日以後，美國的對日反攻戰，以英美的海上勢力爲根本，將漸趨緊張。這在我們也須充分覺悟，而加要　戒的</p>
<p>美國的長期消耗戰方策</p>
<p>那麼，美國的太平洋作戰是什麼呢？美國在南太平洋所企圖的是什麼呢！第一、是整個的對日消耗戰略。這是開戰前華盛頓的有力人士，一開口就拿進話向我恫　。又在報章上。以及所謂軍事專門家，也常究這種文章，把日本的國力評估過低，而預祝本國的勝利。第二，如在阿留申，及現在的南太平徉所進行的「跳島」戰法，一步一步推進其某地以接近日本的心臟部。</p>
<p>他們以爲臼本的共榮圖完成之從，日水從此卞面獲得必要的資材，於果戰力日敵增强，不久日本成爲眞正有堅强抵抗力量的強國。所以不能不及早設法加以阻害，成爲他們的根本方針。</p>
<p>茲看他們所動手的，乃選擇日本的死棧而欲確壞其一角。這是跳島或越鳥戰法。在與團島所買施的，乃飛越基斯加島前來攻擊。在所羅門所實施的亦爲其一，並向千島附近震面作威力偵察，如有可乘之隙；隨時出動，但重心所在，實祗所羅門方面一處‘他們進攻所羅門，乃經麥克沃塞和海爾賽艦隊司令的協議後方才動手，麥克沃塞常說：「不久囘到菲列濱」，他們斯然右從所羅門優拉蒲爾，並從此直後弈島的意思。麥克沃塞又說：「這是劉日作戰上最必要的地點，比起從夏威夷．同拉斯加方面進攻的戰爭來更露重要。」</p>
<p>但我們對於被這「跳鳥戰法」所朦過的聱個消新戰，並不怠於注意及警戒。消耗戰第一先擾亂海上的交通綫，使日本從南方獲得必要的物資發生困難，並阻礙必要的兵員武器運赴前綫。他們因欲襲擊共榮團內的交通路，兵站路，乃使用海上部隊，以潛水艦爲主，飛機副之。如其中國大陸上的航空基地能不被日本空軍所　而推進使用，則伺機以待，立即從空中威脅中國海的交通．但當推進以上二種戰略時，知道僅羣美國的力量無論如何是不夠的，於是屢衣對英國查難其協力的不澈底。（以下轉入業四版）</p>

<h3>一區公署設立　房租仲裁會　負責處理房租糾紛</h3>
<p>中央社訊據第一區公署發表：本署業子設立「房租調解仲裁委員會」，以代前工部局所設房租調解委員會之職務。查在上海租界交還我國政府與前工部局實行裁撤以前，該局爲調整業主與租戶間之關係起見，會設立房租調解委員會，隸屬法律處，從事調解租屋糾紛，一方面保障租戶，以免業主非法加租，另一方面則協助業主，以謀雙方爭端之和平解決，先後處理租屋糾紛案件，爲數不少，成績卓著</p>
<p>聘請委員密切合作</p>
<p>造租界行政權，交還我國政府以後，該房租調解委員會因法律處之撤消，即改隸社會福利處。社會福利處原有分租房屋管理科之組織，調解二房東與三房客之糾紛，故將業主與租戶間之爭端，歸由該處辦理，自應不合、爰將房租調解委員會改組爲「房租調解仲裁委員會」，并聘請社會碩產，擔任委員、與社會福利處密切合作，處理本區轄境內之房租糾紛事件。</p>
<p>謀取爭端和平解決</p>

<p>中國的物價政策策右兩種見解，一是低物價政策、另一是以獲得物資爲主，亦右主張高物價者，引起論戰，此種眞體問題的提起，實露華中經濟當前最大的課題，在物價政策的意義而言，總之需要增加農業生產，政策不過是達到目的之一種計劃而已。</p>
<p>就一般而論，農民感　較爲遲飩，農業亦富於情性，在中國社會情況下，尤其是事變以後的現在，非右相當修正不可，關於農民生產與消費，收入與支出，應從農家經濟全體　合的立塲，作敢買種種晨產物價格適當的調整，各個農產物之比重如何，亦應加以研究，此種具體的事情，均極電要，爲敢買地區與收買機構主要的條件，是亟應加以考慮的。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭時期，輩中經濟當前的任務，是在農產物的供應，晨民把晨產品出　以後，自須交換生活上必需的物資，其主要買入者，即爲都市之工業生產品，是以農產物的收買價格，必須與其所需票的工業生產品價格，作全部嚴密的對比，一方面希望農　低價供應大量的物資，他方面即應供給義民低價的工業生產品，這除了生產設備合理的統合以外，對於配給機構的整飭完備，亦極重　，此則如商統會等　明，應隨時法意檢討者。</p>
<p>農產物與農產物之問，般產物與工柴品之問，種種價格的均衡，應作全盤打算，而　立物價體系，循此以進，則物價政策之課題，才能解決。（節譯十二月四日大陸新報、</p>

<h3>提介廉潔運動</h3>
<p>— 陳天卓</p>
<p>現在我國正是朝着復興的大道上走、一切行政設施、都要設法改善，革除瀾弊，務使人民安居樂業，然後才能對政府熱烈擁護。尤共對於復興的政務人員之行爲，不能不予以嚴密的監視，以防非法貪污，茲建談辦法數項，以　當局採納：</p>
<p>設立監察部每地設立一所監　部，居於一切機關之上、直接由國防會或監察院管轄，專門監視公務員的非法行爲並設立民集箱，採納人民的報告。建議及告發。</p>
<p>廉潔演習監察部得到人民的報告，就派員調查，或者隨時實行演習。這種演習是專門對於公務人員的試探，是廉潔或是貪污，好像和恐怖演習防空演習一樣，是由監察部，派員侖裝實行，這樣一來，一切的貪污人員，不知來者是眞是假，雖有貪污之心，沒有受贓之姐，實際的政治施行，方有效。</p>
<p>監察部的權限監察部的行使權是祗限於監察政務員的弊遲，及受理人民控告政務員的案件，查出政務員得非法，可以酒權撤其職務，至於人民遠法、則不受理，使職權專一。</p>
<p>免罰辦法如有人民違法或私帶統制品。經政務員查出，而收受賄賂。該人民可以將這事件告發於監察部，如係屬實。贓欵交還原主、並予以免　免罰、或减刑。這點似乎對政務員，勵害一點、但是我們要知道，既然身為公務員，就應該公事公辦、建議這點的目的，就是使官工互相彈劾。</p>
<p>獎勵告發　國人一向是「不管他人瓦上霜」的主義，所以雖有非法不平的事，也不干涉，所以政務員如有非法行爲人民可以隨時向監察部告發。屬寶則給於相當獎金，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>授權自嘗團　不法行爲一經發現後、控告者和被控告者，當然發生爭執、甚至演出野蠻行動、遠抗不去等情，是不可免的同時我們要顧盧到「猩猩惜猩猩」這樣反使理直者當堂食虧，所以要授權自嘗團受理此事。</p>
<p>提高待遇　天下絕沒有「馬兒跑得快馬兒不吃草」的事。所以最後還需講到政務員的待遇問題，要事辦得妥善，必需使做事的人，生活可過，不然雖是善良，因生活所逼，也祇好挺身走險了。</p>
<h3>寄美國國民（上接第二版）</h3>
<p>英國的奪還南方圈方策</p>
<p>蓋此，英國乃從事韻旬奪間戰，試欲協力美國，位逆出了「阿拉　」的悲劇而遭慘敗。奎貝克會談的結果，任命蒙特巴頓爲該方面的最高指揮官、着手新的英美協力作戰。他所擔任的區城。據我所知。大　從蘇門答臘方面起，以至海峽殖民地方面，緬甸方面的作戰。我們在此時尢須注意。他是海軍中將。即此一事。我們不難想像敵所企圖的，乃欲從印度洋方面奪囘南方圈。</p>
<p>加以前進英國自巴昨里與投降後。地中海艦隊的任務非幣地減輕了，大部分義艦也已到手。前地中海艦隊司令長官，現爲英國軍令部總長的克銀漢會作專門，精欲在緬匈，印度洋方面傾注全力，以積極前協助美國的所種門作戰。的確，這情勢現在正展開在我們眼前，且右着即將展開的較據。</p>
<p>日本當局很明白這情形，先取用飛機個別擊破敵人的戰法，我以爲這種戰法是對的。憫別擊破敵人，現在其表現之一，即爲在波根維爾島獲得繼珍殊灣以東的大戰東。這在我不能不衷心霸快，英美艦隊傾其全力於東亞。日本周國軍事上的形勢，東　嚴重，位其主方戰艦，航澄母艦，巡洋艦、及其他　船多數被戰，意義實甚重大，可說是一次極大的成功。然而這並不能說在他們的平體作戰上遇到根本的頓挫，他們始終出擊，如其所羅門方商這挫走不通．則另走他道。祇其作戰方法略有變更，始終執拗地。始終頑　地　來和臼本決一雌雄。我們於此可以看則漸衣走向飛　萬能，潛水　萬能的方向。</p>
<h3>日美交涉真相</h3>
<p>昭和十六年一九四三年初。我負起打開日美關係的使命赴華盛頓就任大使。誰也知道這一次交涉極爲困難，而終必失敗。三月八日，我和赫爾國務鄉作第一次會談。自此日起迄最後之臼止。凡十問月，恰在前年的這時候，我已知道日美問的對立。因援助重慶問題、而遇到進退二難的暗磋了。</p>
<p>垂死的病人與醫師</p>
<p>大約是九月六日、在邪間題發生的稍前幾天。我伴着手下的書能官會見　幫國務鄉，把日本方面的修正案交給他，以使進行折衝，回大使館後，一直前去的書能官就將當日會談情形起　向東京外務省報告．一　之下果然使用了非當强硬的文甸．實際上，祇要一看那次談話前後的內容。沒有一句話可認為美方對此交消右何誠意。成立這交涉的道路。不是妥協，便是屈服，此外沒有第二條路。可是，我這樣說。事情使完了。我拄我的貴任上，拿起　來。依我所見，振筆直審作報告．說起那時像我的心境，治似一個醫師望着瀕死的病人，除此以外，沒有適當的話可以形容。一個醫師，對於雖似絕望的病人，直到最後爲止，不是不斷絕用啓藥的念頭嗎？（翔：譯自十一月十九日至二十一日讀　報知）</p>

<h3>Opinions on Water, Electricity, and Gas Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Qiao Mu</p>
<p>To cope with extraordinary circumstances and conserve fuel, various public utility companies in this city have implemented restrictions on water, electricity, and gas consumption starting December 1st. The percentage of reduction varies depending on the usage, ranging from 10-20% to 40-50%. As user consumption decreases, the companies' operating revenue will also decrease accordingly. If not compelled by the situation, the companies would certainly not resort to this. Therefore, we hope that all users can recognize the situation and fully cooperate with the unavoidable measures taken by the public utility companies. However, we cannot help but offer a few suggestions regarding the implementation of these measures, hoping that the authorities will consider and adopt them.</p>
<p>Among the public utility companies that have established quotas this time, only the French-owned Ningpo Electric Light Company and the Shanghai Gas Company have officially announced the detailed restriction methods in the newspapers, so that users know what to abide by. However, the Shanghai Power Company, which has the largest number of users, has not yet made a formal announcement. Users lack a standard to self-impose restrictions, as to whether the established methods are completely consistent with the rumors circulating. However, the rumored fines for exceeding the limit are quite substantial. If overconsumption and penalties occur, it will be difficult to prevent users from using this as an excuse to dispute with the company. Therefore, the Shanghai Power Company has an urgent need to officially announce the detailed restriction methods as soon as possible to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, although the price increases of various companies are stipulated to take effect from a certain month, the consumption after the meter reading of the previous month has not been calculated separately. Because the amount of the price increase was relatively small, users did not pay much attention to it. This time, the stipulated fine for exceeding the limit is quite substantial. If someone had their meter read on the 20th of last month, then the remaining days of this month would only be two-thirds of a month, and no matter how strictly the limit is enforced, it would be difficult to exactly meet the quota. Since the new method is stipulated to be implemented on December 1st, it should not be retroactive to avoid users being penalized innocently. Therefore, we advocate that the consumption after the meter reading in November should be calculated separately from the consumption in December, and separate bills should be issued to ensure fairness and avoid the possibility of most users being penalized for exceeding the limit.</p>
<p>The new restriction method stipulates that electricity users, regardless of their past electricity consumption, will be uniformly reduced to 70% (Shanghai Power Company) or 65% (French Electric Light Company) of the highest monthly consumption in October, November, and December. We believe that such a general regulation is not very reasonable. Because those who waste electricity on weekdays can still be unaffected even if 30% (or 35%) is deducted now. However, those who have already been extremely frugal and only consume to the bare minimum have nothing left to cut. As a compromise, the two companies should set a minimum electricity limit based on the amperage of the users' meters to provide relief.</p>
<p>There are some unclear or unexplained points in the company's announcements. For example, item A of the Gas Company's announcement of the new restriction quota stipulates that the new restriction quota is based on the average consumption in January, February, and March, and is reduced proportionally according to different uses. However, item B stipulates that the minimum restriction quota is 130 units. Suppose a certain cooking user's average consumption in January, February, and March is 100 units, will it be reduced to 80 units according to the proportional reduction stipulated in item A? Or will it be increased to 130 units according to item B? Or can it be exempted from reduction because it does not meet the minimum restriction? The meaning is unclear. Users may be penalized for exceeding the limit due to misunderstanding, and the company may inevitably increase disputes as a result. Clear explanation and public announcement seem to be imperative.</p>
<p>The amount of water used is closely related to cleanliness and hygiene. From a public health standpoint, restricting water use is absolutely unacceptable except in cases of water shortage. Moreover, the fuel consumption of water plants is far less than that of power plants. Furthermore, why are citizens in one district not restricted, while citizens in the other eight districts are restricted in the same city? Not only should the French Tramway and Electric Light Company pay attention to this point, but we also hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to it as well.</p>
<p>We agree with the selection of suggestions in the short commentary in this month's issue 3B of the China News regarding the electricity consumption of production industries, which should not be restricted in the context of wartime production increases. Furthermore, smoothing the sources of coal supply is a fundamental issue, and all authorities should strive to plan for it.</p>
<p>Finally, one more point: Public utilities are monopolistic by nature, so in various countries, it is customary that any amendments to the business charter that are related to the interests of citizens must be approved by the city council and formally approved by the municipal authorities. This time, the public utility companies in this city have revised the restriction methods, and it seems that the approval procedure for the main municipal authorities has been overlooked, which we also find regrettable.</p>

<h3>Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Occupation of Changde County City; Head of the Combat Reporting Team Made a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Changde on the 4th, the Chongqing troops in Changde surrendered by waving a white flag on the morning of the 3rd after defending the area for a week under fierce attack by the Japanese army. By this point, Changde County City had been completely occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th that the Imperial Japanese Army began its offensive operation against the Chongqing 6th War Area on November 2nd, giving the Chongqing troops in that war zone a thorough beating, and completely occupied Changde County City at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. The main comprehensive combat results since the start of the operation up to December 1st (excluding the combat results of the Changde County City capture operation) are as follows: Chongqing army losses: The Chongqing army corpses recovered by our side numbered 18,497; 3,361 prisoners; 14 Chongqing aircraft shot down; 74 artillery pieces captured; 3,275 guns captured. Our losses: 556 killed in action.</p>
<p>Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain frontline area of the Japanese army in Central China, the head of the Japanese Central China Front Operations Army Reporting Team made a statement, explaining the significance of the Japanese army's capture of Changde. The general idea is that the Japanese army captured Changde, an important hub in Hunan Province, on the morning of the 3rd. The Chongqing army had previously fortified all the agencies, schools, factories, churches, and residences of Changde County. The Chongqing army's stubborn resistance is rare in the history of the Chinese battlefield. Today, we have wiped it out in one fell swoop and occupied it, which can be said to have crushed the Chongqing side's thinking of resistance. It has a profound impact on the Chongqing side militarily, politically, economically, and psychologically. Since the start of the Japanese army's operation, it has only been a little over three decades, and it has wiped out the second-line corps of the Chongqing army. The Changde operation, although only one battle in this operation, has already crushed the Chongqing army's heavy forces on the Yuanjiang River, which is of great significance. From this, it can be seen the skill of the Japanese army in integrated siege and field tactics. The first half of the war has passed, and it is approaching the second stage. Thanks to the success of this operation and the courage of the Japanese army, the situation of the war is expanding.</p>
<p>The offensive into the interior is witnessing great results. The Chongqing army, after losing the sixth district, mobilized the forces of the ninth war zone in its poverty in order to try to act wantonly. But this kind of action only gives the Japanese army an opportunity to eliminate them. The Japanese army will immediately punish the newly mobilized troops of the Chongqing army, and the time of their annihilation will not be far away.</p>
<p>Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain frontline area of the Japanese army in Central China: The Japanese army recently ambushed the Chongqing army, which was moving north from the Ninth War Zone to rescue Changde, near Changde, and achieved great combat results. In this battle, the Japanese army unit completely defeated approximately 5,000 men, including the main force of the 190th Division of the Chongqing army, a part of the 10th Division, and one regiment of the 385th Division, northwest of Zengjiaji. According to reports, the Chongqing army left behind approximately 2,000 corpses, and the Japanese army captured countless mortars and heavy machine guns. Zhu Yue, commander of the 190th Division of the Chongqing army, was killed by a bullet, and the division commander's orderly was also captured by the Japanese army. According to the description of the battle situation, when the Chongqing army was surrounded by the Japanese army, the division commander had the intention of retreating early, and later used a part of the army to resist the Japanese army to cover the retreat of the division headquarters, but it was too late, and the Japanese artillery shells had already struck near the division headquarters, and the division commander was killed by a bullet as soon as he moved. According to reports, four division commanders of the Chongqing army have been killed in this operation.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Amass Heavy Forces, Focus of War Shifts North; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Dnepr Pocket</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: The situation on the Eastern Front has not changed much in recent days. The adverse weather conditions are sufficient to affect the progress of the war, especially the unrelenting heavy rains in the south. However, the Soviet army continues to advance towards the Dnepr Pocket. There is fierce fighting southwest of Kryvyi Rih, as well as in the Cherkasy area. The situation has changed slightly. The Soviet army in the Gomel area has shifted the center of its offensive to the highway between Smolensk and Orsha, concentrating approximately 30 or more infantry divisions there. Further north, German forces are counterattacking southwest and west of Nevel.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German military experts commenting on the military situation on the Eastern Front stated: Although the Soviet army continues its tactics of constantly shifting the focus of the war, it has not achieved any success in the 40-day campaign in the Dnepr River area. On Thursday, in addition to the fighting southwest of Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army launched a new offensive to seize the highway west of Smolensk. The importance of some parts of the Kiev area front has now been lost. The protracted nature of the fighting there is largely due to adverse weather conditions and the resulting mud that makes the ground difficult to travel. A strong offensive by the Soviet army in the western part of the Perekop Isthmus has been repelled, and German forces have achieved some victories in the Kherson area. Due to the severe cold weather in the Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih areas, there is only limited activity, but the major war in the Cherkasy area continues. The Soviet army has concentrated as many as 31 divisions in the area west of Smolensk, which shows how intense the fighting is there.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated yesterday that reports from the British side that Turkey would soon join the war were "one-sided" speculation. Political circles in Berlin have recently made repeated statements to the Turkish press, saying that there is no intention to induce Turkey to participate in the war.</p>
<h3>Madman Arrested for Plotting to Assassinate Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Geneva, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to German news: Agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation captured a madman last month who was plotting to assassinate Roosevelt. The man, Perst, 38 years old, will be imprisoned. Perset stayed in Washington for two days and was arrested on November 13. He had written to his wife expressing his intention to remove Roosevelt. Later, he described his entry into the White House, saying that while the guards were busy unloading goods from a truck, he was thinking about whether he could seize the guard's gun to fulfill his wish when he was discovered by the guard.</p>
<h3>US Railroad Workers Brewing General Strike</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, US railroad workers are currently brewing a general strike. The five Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen's union executives have scheduled a meeting for the 11th in Cleveland, Ohio, to vote on when to begin a general strike. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen's representative, Roth, stated on the 3rd that union workers are currently voting on whether to strike, with a decision expected by the 12th, and that a large number are expected to vote in favor of a strike.</p>
<h3>Northern Adriatic Sweep Concluded, German Forces Fortify Positions in Italian Mountain Region</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Zagreb dispatch, it is reported that the Axis forces' publicized sweep operation in the Northern Adriatic has concluded, and the water city has been completely secured.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: The position of the British Eighth Army on the Italian front has not improved. The left wing of the Anglo-American forces has not yet launched an offensive. General Montgomery's troops have made no progress in the mountainous region near the coast. The renewed intensity of the western front, coupled with the American Fifth Army's concentrated heavy artillery fire on the entrenched German positions, proves that General Eisenhower has ordered General Clark to begin the offensive. In the eastern theater, it is confirmed that the German forces' combat experience is not overshadowed by the enemy's numerical superiority. The enemy's deployment of large numbers of bombers and tanks in the mountainous terrain has proven ineffective. The German counter-offensive has inflicted significant losses on the British Eighth Army, and thus, the army has made no progress in the mountains. Recently, the weather has improved, and both sides' air forces have been active, mutually attacking the enemy's supply lines and transportation hubs. The German air raids on Bari have been very successful.</p>
<h3>US Military Casualties Now Exceed 120,000</h3>

<h3>Weaknesses Exposed in Anti-Axis Camp, Heads of State Conference Apparently Achieves Nothing</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Havas correspondent Fischer: Reliable sources reveal that the anti-Axis powers' heads of state conference held in Iran appears to have been another setback for Anglo-American plans. It is likely that Churchill and Roosevelt will stay somewhere while in their respective countries to discuss the results of the conference. In any case, the long journey made by the Anglo-American leaders to meet Stalin in the Middle East has resulted in a great loss of face. Berlin officials consider this matter the most fortunate evidence of Anglo-American reliance on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Turkish Political Circles' Views</p>
<p>Turkish Capital, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: The ongoing talks between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin have greatly attracted the attention of political figures here. According to the latest information, Stalin stated from the beginning that he could only meet with Roosevelt and Churchill in a location within the Soviet sphere of influence, and therefore refused to go to Cairo and suggested Tehran or Tabriz as the meeting location. These individuals predict that political issues concerning post-war European borders will not be brought up for discussion. The official report issued after the Cairo Conference between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek has also drawn the attention of political figures here. The semi-official organ "Ulus Newspaper" commented that the United States clearly harbors ambitions to dominate the Pacific. The newspaper also noted that Australia's failure to formally participate in the Cairo Conference is quite noteworthy. Chongqing seems also to be dissatisfied with the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill conference, and a spokesman for the Chongqing Embassy in Turkey has strongly stated that the wording of the official report was not drafted in consultation with Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek's wife served as an interpreter during the Cairo Conference, and her translations were reportedly subject to strict scrutiny by the British side. It is said that Madame Chiang protested to the British authorities.</p>
<p>British Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report from London, public dissatisfaction in Britain with the Cairo Conference resolutions is increasing. If the Tehran Conference does not yield satisfactory results, Churchill will not be well-received by the people upon his return to Britain. "Svenska Aftonbladet" stated that Londoners are now beginning to realize that the publication of the Cairo Conference resolutions was a major blunder, as the anti-Axis powers' intentions towards Japan only serve to increase the resistance of both Japan and Germany. In addition, the lack of concrete plans in the Cairo Communiqué has also been met with strong criticism. According to London's view, the anti-Axis group should draft future construction plans for East Asian nations as a countermeasure to Japan's "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and at the very least, guarantee the political independence and economic development of East Asian countries. The British Conservative Party publication "The Observer" is sparing no effort in criticizing the anti-Axis powers' policies, especially in Europe, which only serve to confirm Germany's slogan that "the anti-Axis powers' war aims are to destroy Germany."</p>
<h3>Switzerland to Establish Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union, Contents of Soviet-Czech Treaty Revealed</h3>
<p>Basel, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report, the Swiss "Basler National-Zeitung" reported yesterday that Switzerland will establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The source of this news is based on the fact that the Swiss Federal Council's Foreign Affairs Committee recently met to discuss "establishing normal diplomatic relations with various great powers." The newspaper continued, saying that Swiss economic circles have adopted a more lenient attitude toward the Soviet Union, and business relations between the two countries are in preparation.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London revealed on Friday the contents of the soon-to-be-signed Soviet-Czech treaty. The treaty contains five articles: 1. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia mutually guarantee that the war against Germany and its allies will continue. 2. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia guarantee mutual assistance and will take joint action against any future German actions that harm both countries. 3. Post-war economic cooperation. 4. Neither party shall interfere in the other's internal affairs. 5. Invite European countries bordering the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia to join this treaty.</p>

<h3>To the American People</h3>
<p>— Yoshisaburo Nomura</p>
<p>In the midst of the victory at Bougainville, the Greater East Asia War has already entered its second year. On the first anniversary last year, we said that Showa 18 (i.e., 1943) was the decisive year for the future, and the great battle between Japan and the United States currently underway in the Solomon Islands is truly the climax of that decisive battle. Our interception is extremely sharp, but the enemy's counterattacks are also becoming increasingly fierce, and our situation is becoming increasingly serious. Former Ambassador to the United States, right-wing member, and Navy Admiral Yoshisaburo Nomura has contributed an article entitled "To the American People" to our newspaper (Dokuritsu Hochi). The article reviews the encounters during the final breakdown of Japan-US negotiations from November 20th to 26th two years ago, and points out Roosevelt's ambition to dominate the world, and its shocking contradiction with the feelings of American people's lives, amidst the current war situation where frequent victories are being reported. The fatal blow in the Solomon Islands is truly the only opportunity for the American people to calmly reflect on that contradiction, and in Japan, it is an excellent opportunity for 100 million people to elevate the "decisive year" to a "year of victory" due to this battle.</p>
<p>Seeing the recent war situation centered on the Solomon Islands, although there have been repeated battles in the north, the adventurous war of the United States, which has not yet launched an attack, the first thing that comes to my mind is the decision of the Quebec Conference in August. In that conference, the United Kingdom and the United States began specific discussions on a joint operational plan to attack Japan. This can also be seen from Churchill's remarks at the time. The sudden activation of the war in the Solomon Islands is one of its manifestations.</p>
<p>The Pacific First doctrine or the Europe First doctrine has always been the focus of American discussion. Some have argued that the United States should take on the Pacific, while the United Kingdom should take on the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The Quebec Conference went a step further, and the United Kingdom and the United States not only agreed on the war goal of attacking Japan, but also decided to closely cooperate on operational goals in the Pacific. From the United Kingdom's appointment of Mountbatten to the transfer of the Mediterranean Fleet to the Indian Ocean and the concentration of the US Navy on Rabaul with a large-scale fleet, these events have an inextricable relationship that cannot be examined individually. The blows inflicted by the Japanese Navy on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of the Coral Sea at the beginning of the war shattered the Anglo-American alliance in the Pacific waters and severed the iron ring of the so-called encirclement of Japan. Now, the new Anglo-American counterattack plan against Japan decided at the Quebec Conference has suffered another setback in the Solomon Islands before it could be implemented. This great Japanese victory in the Solomon Islands is extremely significant in many ways, and its impact will be profound from now on. The American people must take this opportunity to remember once again how strong the strategic posture of the East Asian grindstone once established is, and how unreasonable it is for the United Kingdom and the United States to try to break through this outer line from east to west.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the United States completely lacked the confidence to fight Japan independently. The United States knew that without using the strength of the United Kingdom and without relying on British power, it would have no chance of winning the war against Japan in Asia. This will be described in detail later. As the former ambassador to the United States, I was responsible for opening negotiations for Japan-US relations. At that time, the American leaders knew in more detail than any other country regarding military preparations, the morale of the soldiers, the preparations of the people, and Japan's geographical position in East Asia that Japan was the most terrifying enemy in the world. Only in the point of material production did they see that Japan had a weakness. However, they did not think that they could defeat Japan on their own. Has this not changed at all after the start of the war? In fact, due to the strength of the Japanese Army and Navy, the firm strategic position of securing Asia is being actively completed. The American people cannot but further recognize this situation.</p>
<p>In Europe, after the surrender of the Badoglio regime in Italy, the United Kingdom's naval power in the Mediterranean was more than adequate. However, the domestic situation in the United States does not allow the war to continue for a long time. The longer the war drags on, the stronger Japan's war power will only become. As such, the Quebec Conference decided on a large-scale Anglo-American counter-offensive strategy in the Pacific. Now, the enemy's operations, centered on the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, have suddenly become active. Waiting for the assistance of the United Kingdom coming from the Indian Ocean, from today onwards, the American counter-offensive war against Japan, with the Anglo-American naval power as the foundation, will gradually become tense. We must also be fully aware of this and be more vigilant.</p>
<p>American Strategy of Prolonged Attrition</p>
<p>So, what is the American strategy in the Pacific? What is the United States trying to achieve in the South Pacific? First, it is an overall strategy of attrition against Japan. This is what influential people in Washington said to me at the beginning of the war. Also, newspapers and so-called military experts often wrote articles evaluating Japan's national strength as being too low and predicting their own country's victory. Second, like the "island hopping" tactics being carried out in the Aleutians and now in the South Pacific, they are gradually advancing to approach the heart of Japan.</p>
<p>They believed that once Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere was completed, Japan would obtain the necessary materials from there, and as a result, its war power would increase day by day. Soon, Japan would become a truly strong country with strong resistance. Therefore, they believed that they had to find a way to obstruct this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Now, what they are doing is choosing a weak point of Japan to break down one corner of it. This is the island hopping or over-island tactics. When attacking the group of islands, they flew over Kiska Island to attack. The implementation in the Solomon Islands is also one of them, and they are also conducting power reconnaissance on the area near the Kuril Islands. If there is a gap to take advantage of, they will launch at any time, but the center of gravity is actually only in the Solomon Islands. They attacked the Solomon Islands only after the agreement of the MacArther and Halsey fleet commanders. MacArthur often said, "We will return to the Philippines soon." They clearly intend to take the Solomon Islands and Rabaul and then go straight to other islands from there. MacArthur also said, "This is the most necessary location for the war against Japan, and it is more important than a war launched from Hawaii or Alaska."</p>
<p>However, we are not negligent in paying attention to and being vigilant about this "island hopping tactic" that has blinded the entire new war. The first step in the attrition strategy is to disrupt the sea transportation lines, making it difficult for Japan to obtain the necessary supplies from the south and hindering the transportation of necessary troops and weapons to the front lines. They use naval forces, mainly submarines, and supplemented by aircraft in order to attack the transportation routes and supply routes within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the air bases on mainland China can be advanced and used without being destroyed by the Japanese air force, they will wait for an opportunity and immediately threaten the traffic in the China Sea from the air. However, when promoting the above two strategies, they know that the power of the United States alone is not enough, so they have repeatedly complained about the lack of thorough cooperation from the United Kingdom.

<h3>Municipal Government Establishes Police Office to Manage Citywide Police Affairs, Mayor Chen Concurrently Serves as Director</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has established the "Shanghai Special Municipal Police Office" to coordinate citywide police affairs, managing the First and Second Police Bureaus of the city, as well as the police corps formed by organizing the volunteer police teams from the former Public Concession and the preparatory teams from the former French Concession. Mayor Chen concurrently serves as the Director, Lu Ying is the Chief of the Second Police Bureau, Du Zhengjian is the Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau, and Su Chengde is appointed as the Chief of Staff. The office has a secretariat and an audit office, with Sun Lifu serving as the Chief Secretary and Dai De serving as the Chief Auditor. Subsequently, the citywide police will be under the guidance of this office, which is temporarily located in the office of Chief Sun of the General Affairs Department of the First District Public Office.</p>
<h3>First District Public Office Establishes Rent Arbitration Committee to Handle Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that according to an announcement by the First District Public Office, the office has established the "Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee" to take over the duties of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Rent Mediation Committee. Before the return of the Shanghai Concession to the Chinese government and the implementation of the abolition of the former Municipal Council, the council established the Rent Mediation Committee under the Legal Department in order to adjust the relationship between landlords and tenants, mediating disputes over rental housing, protecting tenants from illegal rent increases, and assisting landlords in seeking peaceful resolution of disputes. The committee handled a significant number of rental housing disputes, achieving remarkable results.</p>
<p>Inviting Committee Members for Close Cooperation</p>
<p>After the return of the Concession's administrative rights to the Chinese government, the Rent Mediation Committee was transferred to the Social Welfare Department due to the abolition of the Legal Department. The Social Welfare Department originally had an organization called the Subletting Housing Management Section to mediate disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants, so it was deemed inappropriate to assign disputes between landlords and tenants to the department. Therefore, the Rent Mediation Committee was reorganized into the "Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee," and prominent social figures were invited to serve as committee members, working closely with the Social Welfare Department to handle rental disputes within the jurisdiction of the district.</p>
<p>Seeking Peaceful Resolution of Disputes</p>
<p>If there are disputes between landlords and tenants, they should seek peaceful resolutions and should not resort to violence or legal action. If direct negotiations between the two parties are ineffective, they can submit the case to the office's Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee for review. Inquiries regarding the procedures for submitting cases and other information can be made at Office 375, Social Welfare Department, No. 180 Fuzhou Road. The committee members are as follows: Chairman Huang Xuanping, Committee Members Ge Leqin, Zhang Deyin, Jian Benyi, Yu Xianwen, Fukuda Fujixiong, and Yao Hui.</p>
<h3>Eight and a Half "He" of Rice Per Person for Seventh Term in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is learned that the allocation of rice for the 27th term to residents in the Western Shanghai district, totaling 2,150 bags of rice, has been prepared for sale by the joint sales office of the district public office. The rice will be sold simultaneously at 55 public rice shops throughout the district starting today (5th). It is also learned that due to the small bag size and insufficient "jin" weight of the rice, as well as the limited amount of rice left over from the previous term, the allotted amount cannot be fully met. Therefore, each person can purchase eight and a half "he" of rice per certificate (27th term), priced at 6.8 yuan. Sales will run from today until the 11th.</p>
<h3>Eighth District Land Tax Due by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Public Office of the city has stipulated that land tax collection will be conducted in two installments per year, with late payment subject to overdue interest.

The district public office has decided that all landlords in the district who owe land taxes must apply for payment to the administrative office this year to avoid penalties for exceeding the deadline.</p>
<h3>Price Limits Set for Various Types of Eggs</h3>

<h3>Jiaozhou Park Packed with People, Tung Wah-Kun Luen Match, Sun "Iron Leg" Scores Decisive Goal</h3>
<p>The first major battle for the Group A championship between Tung Luen took place yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Just after noon, fans began to arrive in droves. Before 2:00 PM, an order was given to tightly close the iron gates, causing a surge of people outside the venue. Both teams' players were also blocked outside the gates. Although the gates were briefly opened, there was no room to stand inside the venue, and the crowd outside broke through the barriers and rushed in, causing the venue's fences to be almost completely demolished! Order inside the venue could not be maintained. Under the protection of the military police, the players outside the gates were able to enter the park, and the match began with difficulty, delayed by half an hour from the scheduled time. It is estimated that there were no fewer than ten thousand spectators at Jiaozhou Park yesterday. As a result, the first half saw tight defenses from both sides, with no goals scored. In the second half, Tung Wah's Sun Jinshun scored a goal, giving Tung Wah the precious goal and the victory. The lineups for both teams:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Li Weizhuang, You Ren, Liang Shuye, Kuang Diaozhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Jing, Han Longhai, You Liang, Wang Xisheng</p>
<p>Kun Luen</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Zheng Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Yu Zhenyue, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Overview of the Great Battle</p>
<p>Yesterday's match saw both sides extremely tense due to the high stakes involved. Neither team was at their best, especially Zhang Banglun. Others such as Kuang Diaojing, Song Lingsheng, and Xu Wenkui also underperformed. Li Yichen had been out of practice for a long time and did not have any special performances. Li Yao was unable to find an outlet under Wu Qixiang's surveillance. Li Ning, Kuang Fu, Zheng Ying, Zheng Yongfu, and Huang Chunhua all had outstanding performances.</p>
<p>Shu Tang Injured</p>
<p>The great battle began under the guard of military police. Kun Luen initially had the advantage of playing with the wind. Tung Wah launched an attack towards the north, but the attack was intercepted. After several passes, Longhai swept a diagonal shot, which Liu Xianhan dived to save. Yichen returned the favor, and the same thing happened. At this point, Tung Wah's attack was at its peak. Kun Luen's Song Lingsheng adopted a three-man defense, holding on tightly. After 35 minutes, Liang Shuye was seriously injured and left the field while intercepting Gao Baozheng's advance. The match was also temporarily suspended for one minute. Tung Wah replaced him with Zheng Xisheng, assigned to the right wing, and You Liang was brought inside. Longhai replaced the vacated position. The first half ended with a double goose egg (0-0).</p>
<p>"Iron Leg" Blooms</p>
<p>After the intermission, the great battle continued with excitement. At this time, Kun Luen also switched from defense to offense. The strengths of both sides were evenly matched, and they rotated the attacks. A Yichen missed three consecutive close-range opportunities. This one mistake led to a major error. Tung Wah finally scored in the 28th minute when Sun Jinshun received a cross from Wang Xisheng and shot, scoring a goal for Kun Luen.</p>
<p>Kun Luen Protests</p>
<p>With Tung Wah scoring a goal, the fans cheered wildly. At the end of the match, Tung Wah won 1-0. It is rumored that Kun Luen will submit a written protest to the Football Association, requesting a replay based on the order on the field yesterday.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Issue of Price Policy</h3>
<p>There are two views on China's price policy: one is a low-price policy, and the other is to focus on obtaining materials, and some advocate high prices, causing debate. The raising of this kind of real issue is indeed the biggest challenge facing China's economy today. In terms of the meaning of price policy, it ultimately needs to increase agricultural production, and policy is just a plan to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, farmers are relatively slow to respond, and agriculture is also full of inertia. Under China's social circumstances, especially now after the incident, considerable corrections must be made. Regarding farmers' production and consumption, income and expenditure, we should adopt a comprehensive perspective of the entire farm household economy, making appropriate adjustments to the prices of various agricultural products, and the proportion of various agricultural products should also be studied. These specific matters are extremely important, and the main conditions for procurement areas and procurement agencies should be considered urgently.</p>
<p>During the Greater East Asia War, the current task of the Chinese economy is the supply of agricultural products. After farmers sell their agricultural products, they must exchange them for daily necessities. The main purchasers are industrial products from cities, so the purchase price of agricultural products must be thoroughly compared with the prices of the industrial products they need. On the one hand, we hope that farmers will supply a large amount of materials at low prices, and on the other hand, we should supply farmers with low-priced industrial products. In addition to the rational integration of production equipment, the rectification and perfection of distribution agencies are also extremely important. This, like the Shangtonghui, etc., should be reviewed and considered at any time.</p>
<p>The balance of various prices between agricultural products and agricultural products, between industrial products and firewood products, should be comprehensively planned, and a price system should be established. Following this, the issue of price policy can be resolved. (Excerpt translated from the December 4th Continental New Daily)</p>
<h3>Financial Inspection Office Will Implement Audits on Various Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>Since the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank implemented the inspection of financial institutions' business in accordance with the regulations of the temporary measures for the management of financial institutions promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the implementing rules, the promotion of inspections has been smooth. The financial institutions (reserve funds) are all prepared. However, the office, in view of the fact that in recent years, general small banks and money shops newly established in the city often engage in illegal operations and issue long-term promissory notes to transfer funds, and even fail to pay when the promissory notes are due, which seems to affect the entire gold industry significantly, therefore, in order to protect the people's assets and stabilize finance, in addition to formulating measures to ban the issuance of long-term promissory notes by money shops, which have been implemented since the 1st of this month, it has been decided to implement audits on the deposit and loan business of various financial institutions in the future.</p>
<h3>Various Guilds Notify Members to Declare Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance issued a notice stating that the income tax on profitable enterprises in the 30th year has been levied for more than a year, and most of the merchants have complied with the payment. However, there are still some who have delayed in filing, which is extremely negligent. In addition to sending officials from the bureau to urge payment, it also separately sent letters to various industry guilds to inform their members to truthfully report the amount of income tax on profitable enterprises in the 30th year as soon as possible. If those who have not paid in the 29th year should also report it together. After receiving the order, each guild has notified its members to report on the specified date.</p>
<h3>Hama North Boiled Water Shops to Distribute Coal in Four Grades</h3>
<p>The authorities in charge of allocating the flat-priced coal for boiled water shops north of the Suzhou River have decided to start the first distribution from this month and have set tomorrow (6th) to the 10th as the date for paying for the goods and completing the procedures. This flat-priced coal is limited to self-burning and must not be resold. If such a situation occurs, the right to distribution will be terminated. According to further investigations by a Shanghai News reporter yesterday, the flat coal for boiled water shops north of the Suzhou River is divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A is 1.5 tons, Grade B is 1.25 tons, Grade C is 1 ton, and Grade D is half a ton (i.e., 500 kg). The flat price is 581 yuan per ton in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>

<h3>Introducing the Integrity Movement</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianzhuo</p>
<p>Our country is now moving towards the road to revival. All administrative facilities must be improved, eliminate shortcomings, and ensure that people live and work in peace and contentment. Then can they enthusiastically support the government. In particular, the behavior of public officials in the revival administration must be closely monitored to prevent illegal corruption. Here are some suggestions for the authorities to adopt:</p>
<p>Establish a Supervisory Department: Establish a Supervisory Department in each region, which is above all agencies and directly under the jurisdiction of the National Defense Council or the Control Yuan. It specializes in monitoring the illegal behavior of public officials and establishes a people's collection box to adopt people's reports, suggestions, and accusations.</p>
<p>Integrity Drill: When the Supervisory Department receives a report from the people, it sends personnel to investigate or conducts drills at any time. This kind of drill is specifically for testing public officials, whether they are honest or corrupt, just like a terror drill or an air defense drill. It is carried out by the Supervisory Department, sending personnel in plain clothes. In this way, all corrupt officials, not knowing whether the comers are real or fake, even if they have a corrupt heart, will not have the opportunity to accept bribes. The actual political implementation will be effective.</p>
<p>The Scope of the Supervisory Department's Authority: The exercise of authority of the Supervisory Department is limited to monitoring the corruption of public officials and accepting cases of people accusing public officials. If it finds that a public official has acted illegally, it can revoke their position. As for violations of the law by the people, it is not handled, so that the authority is specialized.</p>
<p>Exemption Method: If a public official discovers that a person has violated the law or privately carries controlled goods and accepts bribes, the person can report this incident to the Supervisory Department. If it is true, the embezzled money will be returned to the original owner, and they will be exempted from punishment, or the sentence will be reduced. This seems to be a little harmful to public officials, but we must know that since we are public officials, we should handle official matters impartially. The purpose of suggesting this is to enable officials and workers to impeach each other.</p>
<p>Encourage Reporting: The Chinese people have always adhered to the principle of "not caring about the frost on other people's roofs," so even if there are illegal and unfair things, they do not interfere. Therefore, if public officials have illegal behavior, the people can report it to the Supervisory Department at any time. If it is true, a considerable bonus will be given to encourage them.</p>
<p>Authorize the Self-Governing Regiment: Once illegal behavior is discovered, disputes will naturally arise between the accuser and the accused, and even uncivilized actions and resistance will be inevitable. At the same time, we must consider that "apes cherish apes," which will make those who are right lose out in court. Therefore, we must authorize the Self-Governing Regiment to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Improve Treatment: There is no such thing as "a horse running fast without eating grass" in the world. Therefore, in the end, we need to talk about the treatment of public officials. To handle matters properly, it is necessary to ensure that the people doing the work can live a decent life, otherwise, even if they are kind, they will have to take risks due to the pressure of life.</p>
<h3>Sending to American Citizens (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>British Strategy to Recapture the Southern Sphere</p>
<p>Therefore, England has been engaged in a war of regaining lost territory, trying to cooperate with the United States, but encountered the tragedy of "Arakan" and suffered a disastrous defeat. As a result of the Quebec Conference, Mountbatten was appointed as the supreme commander in that area and began a new Anglo-American joint operation. The area he is in charge of, as far as I know, is the operation from the Sumatra area to the Strait Settlements area and the Burmese area. We must pay special attention at this time. He is a naval vice admiral. From this one thing, it is not difficult for us to imagine what the enemy is trying to do, which is to recapture the Southern Sphere from the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>In addition to the British advance from Basra and after the surrender, the task of the Mediterranean Fleet was not reduced by currency, and most of the Italian ships had already been captured. The former commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, now the chief of the British Naval Staff, Cunningham, will specialize in concentrating all his efforts in the Burmese and Indian Ocean areas to actively assist the various operations of the United States. Indeed, this situation is now unfolding before our eyes, and there are reports of it about to unfold.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities understand this situation very well, and first use the tactic of individually destroying the enemy with aircraft. I think this tactic is correct. The individual destruction of the enemy, one of its current manifestations, is the acquisition of the great war east of Zhenzhushawan in Bougainville. I cannot help but be sincerely happy about this. The British and American fleets are pouring all their efforts into East Asia. The military situation in Japan is serious, because most of its main battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships have been sunk. The significance is very significant, and it can be said to be a great success. However, this does not mean that they have encountered a fundamental setback in their overall operations. They always attack, and if this route in the Solomon Islands does not work, they will take another route. It's just that their tactics have changed slightly, but they are always stubbornly and persistently coming to fight with Japan. From this, we can see the gradual shift towards the omnipotence of aircraft and the omnipotence of submarines.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Japanese-American Negotiations</h3>
<p>In early Showa 16 (1941), I took on the mission of opening up Japanese-American relations and went to Washington to take office as ambassador. Everyone knows that this negotiation was extremely difficult and would eventually fail. On March 8, I had my first meeting with Secretary of State Hull. From that day until the end, for ten months, just about this time last year, I already knew that the confrontation between Japan and the United States was due to the issue of assisting Chongqing, and I encountered a dilemma.</p>
<p>A Dying Patient and a Doctor</p>
<p>Around September 6, a few days before the Yaxie incident, I accompanied a secretary to meet with Secretary of State Hull and handed him the Japanese amendment to conduct consultations. After returning to the embassy, the secretary who had been there directly drafted a report on the situation of the meeting that day to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. As expected, he used very tough language. In fact, just by looking at the content before and after that conversation, there was not a single sentence that could be considered that the US had any sincerity in this elimination. The path to establishing this negotiation was either compromise or surrender. There was no other way. However, I said this and the matter was over. I took up the task on my shoulder and reported with a pen in hand. Speaking of my mood at that time, it was like a doctor looking at a dying patient. There were no appropriate words to describe it other than this. For a doctor, isn't he constantly trying to prescribe medicine for a seemingly hopeless patient until the very end? (Xiang: Translated from the November 19th to 21st Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Supporting Old-Age Assistance: Zhi Zhi Lay Buddhist Generously Donates Four Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>— Jing Wan</p>
<p>Honoring the elderly and raising people's "filial piety," for filial piety is the law of heaven, the righteousness of the earth, and the conduct of the people. People cannot do without filial piety. To practice filial piety, one must first honor the elderly. Filial piety is the foundation of establishing oneself and is the first of all virtues. Students enter and are filial, and leave and are fraternal. Is filial piety and fraternity the root of being human? Nowadays, we are highly promoting the eight virtues and emphasizing filial piety. To emphasize filial piety, we must first honor the elderly. This is the painstaking effort of advocating "old-age assistance."</p>
<p>Honoring the elderly is to respect the masses, not just to do good deeds and provide relief, but also to be a principle of conduct. The meaning of honoring the elderly is great. May our elderly not fail Heaven's mandate.</p>
<p>Respecting the elderly, Western sages, cultivating oneself and bringing peace to others, transmitting good fortune to assist the weak, and often prospering to relieve the poor, this is called mutual assistance. Heaven will surely help those who help themselves. The elderly especially value self-help. This old-age assistance has another meaning.</p>
<p>Honor my elderly and extend it to the elderly of others. All human beings must promote filial piety, then young and old will have order, and women and children will be suitable. From politicians, businessmen, and scholars to hawkers and footmen, all must promote filial piety and all should honor the elderly. This is why the Haiying Association is named. They all share the ambition of promoting filial piety and are unified and firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a generous donation of four thousand yuan from Zhi Zhi Lay Buddhist for the relief of poor orphans, promoting the heart of honoring the elderly and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance. I am very grateful. I also hope that all philanthropists from all walks of life will enthusiastically respond, generously donate, and not let any elderly person live alone, to benefit humanity. The merits are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Hidden Poverty Needs Winter Clothing: Can Register at This Office</h3>

We are currently preparing to make clothes. Any hidden poor in this city, regardless of men, women, old or young, who really need winter clothes, can register at the social service office of this newspaper from tomorrow onwards, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM, bringing their citizen ID card. Those who are confirmed by this newspaper to be truly poor will be given a gift, but on the back of the citizen ID card, this newspaper will stamp "Winter Clothing Gifted in the 32nd Year." If the citizen ID card already has the same stamp from another place, please do not register again.</p>
<h3>Appreciating Paintings at Cun Tian Ge and Giving Them to Mr. Hai Su</h3>
<p>— Bin Qu</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I love to watch paintings. Whenever I encounter famous collections, I must go. Mr. Hai Ye is a friend of mine, and I recently got to see famous paintings from his Cun Tian Ge. I returned with great interest. I wrote a poem to give to him.</p>
<p>The heavenly wind blows Cun Tian Ge, Canghai came to Huabiao, treasures were transported back 20,000 miles, and the racks were full of rare and wonderful works. The smoke and clouds were dotted with wind and rain, and the flowing waterfalls fell upside down into the bright river. The mustaches and eyebrows in the book moved as if they were alive, and the hairpins and flowers and birds seemed to kneel and fly. The master of art returned to the country for the first time, and for a time the paper was returned to the capital. We have seen the strength of your pen, and it is powerful and fights with dragons. Sometimes pale flowers are dotted with a few strokes, and the strangeness is like a swallow skimming. Shi Tian's stone plate has turned into dust, and we see his talent again in writing hills and valleys. The distant axis sweeps across the Swiss mountains, and the layers of mist want to go up to the Fuchun Guo. The embellishment of the oil paintings increases the beauty, and the layers are even more detached. I have seen many famous scholars, and their talents are often weak. You alone crown the heroes, and hold ten thousand virtues. Wash away the powdery habits of Jiangnan, and the grandeur is created calmly. Talking with you about books, it is impossible to make progress, and the talent in your heart is naturally developed. You are tall and high-spirited, startling the audience, and when you talk about profound learning, the sky is vast. The heavenly wind blows my clothes, and the sea waves brush your hair. The lightning flashes, and the high mountains and the sea embrace their minds. The huge waves vent their great plans. The culture of the Central Plains is waiting to be revived, and we look forward to working hard in our lives, and the thousands of years will shine together.</p>
