<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日經濟合作再檢討</h3>
<p>在中日事變發生的前數年，中日外交關係，已經緊張達於極點，雙方經濟界都看到這種形勢的演進，於中日前途均有不利，極力想用經濟合作的途径，進一步來求政治上的諒解，不料時機未熟，事變突起，一切努力，都成泡影，這在中日經濟界，固不能不引為極端憾事，就是兩國人民，也不能不承認是一件極端憾事。</p>
<p>中日事變已逾六年，到現在已經是大家痛定思痛，力自檢討過去錯誤的時候。可是各人對於自已的錯誤，未必一定看得淸楚，這就等於各人自已面目，非用鏡子不能照見的一樣的道理，我們很願與日本人士交換鏡子，各自照見自巳的面目。</p>
<p>中日是同文同種的國家，土地接壤，有唇齒相依的形勢，在歷史上叉沒有像普法一般的世仇，何以政治卜卻不能融洽，推其原因，當為英美從中挑撥離間所致，但經濟問題，亦不無關係。因為日本是一個島國，限於土地面積，物資生產原本不足，加以明治維新以後，國內工業異常發達，因為原料的取給，便不能不想到物姿的來源，因為成品的推銷，便不能不想到市塲，中國土地廣大，人口稠密，有極好的資源，同時也是極好的市塲，可是中國因為受了英美的經濟勢力所壟斷，於是與日本經濟合作，很難順利實現，這就是過去中日經濟未能密切合作的一個重大原因。</p>
<p>過去中日不能經濟合作，除了受英美的經濟勢力所壟斷以外，還有一個重大原因，就是治外法權的存在。治外法權是英美用作經濟侵略的工具，妨害中國獨立自主，迫使中國人民在其國土之內，不得與外人經濟平等，這是中國任何人民所不能忍受而且不願忍受的事。所以中國人民對於任何享有治外法權的國家，都無好感，並拒絕合作，對日本當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭發生以後，日本對於中國的經濟合作，愈感需要，就是為奠立中日永久的和平基礎着想，經濟合作，也不失為一塊主要的基石，中日人士如果都看到這一點，即應該放棄過去一切成見，切實謀兩國之經濟攜手</p>
<p>中日經濟合作，目下還在最初階段，究竟前途怎樣，還待雙方努力，尤其是一切足以影響經濟合作的障礙，皆須澈底掃除。關於這一點，雙方都應該毫不客氣，亳無隱飾的提出，因為表面上彼此客氣，背地裹卻彼此互相猜忌，已失去合作的基本精神了。</p>
<p>基於中國目前的經濟現狀，我們要向日本人士提出的，有下列各項原則問題：</p>
<p>希望在政治上；經濟上，中日兩國處於平等地位。</p>
<p>經濟一元化，貨幣一元化，是中國經濟復興的主要條件，以理論言，雖是中國本身的事，可是事實上無一樣不需要日本的協力，日本要幫助中國經濟復興，應該先從幫助中國經濟統一，貨幣統一入手。</p>
<p>中國生產，向感落後，物資缺乏，顯屬事實，故於統制物資，限制消費以外，尤其需要積極的增加生產，但言增加生產，不能不講求技術與工具，於此，盼望日本竭力在此方面協助中國增加生產，以期滿足中國人民最低限度之生活需要。</p>
<p>事變後由日方軍管理之工廠，截至上月間，已全部陸續交還，但聞其中一部份工廠，係於軍管理時期委託日商繼續經營，在交還前，日商即以合作為條件。我們認為合作非不可能，但應該尊重業主的意見，更不能以管理費移抵股本的方法，使業主過分吃虧，要是少數人祇顧眼前，就不免影響整個的經濟合作前途。</p>
<p>對於中日產業界的原料配給，電力供給，以及成品之收購。價格之釐定，運輸之便利都應在同一原則之下，平等待遇，華商固不得優於日商，日商亦不得優於華商。</p>
<p>中國人民是向守信義的民族。所以日本假使能以平等互尊之精神待遇中國，則澈底經濟合作，根本並非難事。我們因為深切關懷兩國共同的命運，所以不避質直的貢言，假定能因此促進兩國的精誠合作，樹立東亞永久和平，豈非東亞兩民族之幸。</p>

<h3>侵襲婆羅洲敵機遭　日軍砲火擊退　南太平洋日空軍活躍</h3>
<p>峇厘把板十六日中央社電　姿羅洲峇厘把板，十四日黎明敵四發轟炸機七架來襲，當被日方陸上砲火將其擊退，日方損失較微，此次乃敵方對婆羅洲之初次空襲。</p>
<p>日軍某基地十六日中央社電　日海軍機前曾於六月三十日首次空襲北澳達爾文港東南約七十哩之空軍根據地布羅克斯克里　，繼於七月六日再度奇襲骸地，予敵以重創，收痠莫大戰果。日海軍機頃復於八月十三日夜至深更，會前後四次往襲布羅克斯克里格，及距該地約三十哩之匹奇厄拉兩飛機塲，投彈命中該機塲之各種軍事設施，炸毀其十三處，日機乃安返基地，此足顯示日海軍機已逐漸侵及敵第一綫之贊源地帶。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據今日獲息：日轟炸機至於戰鬥機掩義下，猛攻新幾內亞華烏之美軍陣地。</p>
<h3>德魚雷機猛襲反軸心護航隊　擊沉卅二艘計十七萬噸</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據德國新聞社海軍特派員漢森悄息：八月十三日英美大護航輸送艙團約七十五艘，有大量之驅逐艦及砲艦衛護，從大西洋進入地中海，約於上午八時左右在直布羅陀之東一百十公哩近亞爾波蘭島地方，被德魚曾機所攻擊。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　十三日傍晚德　雷機隊攻擊在直布羅陀之東敵護航隊，沉船三十二艘共計十七萬噸，雖敵方高射砲火猛烈及施放烟幕，亦小足以阻止德機之繼續攻擊，運輸船三艘約三萬，大油船一艘及巡洋艦三艘相繼沉沒，其他入艘中彈起火後，德偵察機報告另有船廿入艘亦告沉沒。</p>
<p>天空魚雷顯示威力</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據海通社訊，昨日德軍戰報宣佈：德魚雷機於星期五夜在直布羅陀附近，擊沉護航隊船隻約一七〇，〇〇〇噸，茲探得詳情如下：德國魚需飛機現在此次勝利前，並未獲得公衆之注意，但內部之人早已知此等德國魚雷飛機在北極海非洲大西洋岸及西西里附近一帶活動，數日來彼等即以攻擊主要航綫上之敵船為其任務，此等堅強之機隊隨時可以出擊，可見佈置之週密。查飛機之魚雷放射管，僅略異於潛艇或魚需艇，其構造殊為馥雜，除推進機外，尚有升降控制機及垂直舵等．通常魚雷須由低空接近日標之處放射，故機員須有極大之勇氣與犧牲精神，每一魚雷機通常携有高度爆炸魚雷兩枚，魚雷具有許多炸彈所不　有之效用，最著者魚曾能深入水中以擊目標，故一經擊中，至少能予對方以重創，惟機員必須冒高射砲火至距離目標極近之處放射，始能中的。</p>
<h3>二次興亞大會昨大滿展幕　日首相義外相分別電賀</h3>
<p>新京十六日中央社電　第二次中日滿興亞團體會議，十六日上午八時在協和會館開幕，出席者計有中國方面東亞聯盟總曾代表主席委員周學昌（南京市長），新民會中央總會代表張子鈞（政治局長），日本方面之大政翼贊會興亞總本部代表主席委員高構大將，國民總力精神聯盟代表主席委員大操練成部長，滿洲方面協和會會長張景惠總理，該會中央水部長三宅氏，協和會代表主席委員于青遠（民政部大臣）等，以及　疆自治政府代表等多人，來資則有梅津關東軍司令官兼日駐滿代理特命全權大使，笠原關東軍參謀長，武部滿洲國政府總務長官，中國駐滿大使陳濟成，以及德義泰各國公使等。準時開會，笠原協和會本部總務部長致開會辭。合暘中日滿三國國歌，默禱完成大東亞戰爭及亞細亞復興，繼之張會長及三宅中央本部長致辭，張國務總理梅津關東軍司令官兼特命全權大使（笠原關東軍參謀長代讀）及各國大公使致祝辭，並宣讀汪主席之祝詞及東條首相之祝電，入時五十分，開會典禮終了。繼之各代表委員參萍建園神廟，九時主席委員代表晉謁滿皇，十時十分赴國務院拜訪張總理及梅津關東軍司令官，寸時半赴協和總會開會，推三宅協和會中央本部長為主席，主席當說明議事進行方針，十時五十分由協和會中失水部委員詳細介紹滿洲國情，至此上午日程終了，下午一時三十分，繼續開會，正副主席委囑各分科會代表後，緊急動議，議決致日本陸海軍感謝文及致中滿兩國政府感謝文，繼之報告各興亞團體運動概况，下午六時第一日議程告終。</p>

<p>古海總務次長報告滿洲現況</p>
<p>新京十六日中央社電　滿洲國總務廳古海次長於卞六日在中日滿興亞團體會議中，介紹滿洲國現况，說明滿洲國所具之偉大力量。大意謂：滿洲國第一次五年計劉業已完成，刻正實施第二次五年計劃，蓋滿洲國為大東亞之物資供給基地，故此後決着重坩加農產，期有　期的增產。本年度日　定戰時緊急增產方策，並寶施除草增加肥料運動及大量開墾農地方策，由於農民之增產熱意，及增產施策之澈底，益以氣候順調，故已得達成所期目的，深信可應中日兩國之需要。又關於礦工業方面，現若重於重工業，增產煤鐵及非鐵金屬，以備他日之發展及增強戰力。又機械工業及其他製造工業亦已逐漸擴充。滿洲國於十年以前僅為農村，今則日發展為一重工業國家，此有助於大東亞戰爭自極巨大。又輕工業方面，過去雖依賴日本，但於第二次五年計削中已說意振興，滿洲國在大東亞鋼鐵之增產計則中，占重要部份，刻正積極強產，期獲所期成果。關於製鐵原料，一部賴華北及蒙張供給，但在最近之將來，擬確立國內自給計劃，鐵續石及煤之開發計劃正着着推進中，深信滿洲國之製鐵事業，對於增強戰力必極有貸獻</p>
<h3>黃河上流洪水氾濫日軍進獲捷　五原一帶渝共給養困難</h3>
<p>張家口十六日中央社電　黃河上流地域，自六月至七月問，因洪水汜監，致五原及黃河南岸一帶，似已悉成澤國！該方面之傳作義軍，亦因此無法自後方取得給養，僅以數地徽發所得，苟延殘喘。至其他之共軍，亦因遭日軍不斷猛擊，及經濟封鎖，致給養頗感困難。該處日軍，乃於最近乘機進剿，結果計共覆彼渝共軍事設施及晉房等三十處，截獲步槍彈藥手溜彈等甚夥，渝共軍交戰兵力累計共入八四六人，被俘九八人，遺棄四三九具，投降者三十人。</p>

<p>西西里軸心軍固守墨西拿</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據德國新開社西西里特派員消息：墨西拿海峽現巳漸成反軸心軍之主要攻擊目標的，但仍是軸心軍固守中。自　鳥至大陸之給養路綫，仍繼續保持交通，雖敵軍屢欲將之切斷，但仍未能收重要之效果。</p>
<h3>首次會談終了邱吉爾返加　羅斯福週內赴奎貝克　將繼續討論廣大計劃</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　海通社以，　貝克與華盛頓官方均宣佈：過去三日中，邱吉爾首相曾在紐約海達公閱羅斯福總統之鄉間別墅內，為總統之上實，是以關於邱氏於抵加拿大後及十四日返奎貝克間之行蹤之謎，已揭曉矣，據悉政界人士均信羅邱二人於三日之聚談中，曾擬取得最重要事件之同意，故渠輩均望邱氏即將對英方軍事代表宣佈數種具體計畫，按邱氏於返奎貝克後，立即召見英方軍事人員舉行會議。</p>
<p>又訊，羅斯福總統則暫返華盛頓，預定本週內赴奎貝克，再開始與邱吉爾會談。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　奎貝克官方昨日宣布：，邱吉爾首相已返至奎貝克，宣告又稱：「邱吉爾業巳與羅斯福總統會見，完成初步之布置，以備雙方在奎貝克偕同諮購人員舉行會議。據悉，與邱吉爾借行者，有其女公子瑪　，迎　者有英，美，加軍事領袖．奎貝克權威方面稱：邱吉爾歸來談，會議之第一階段，業已完成，現巳一切布置完善，以備將羅斯福，邱吉爾所擬之農大計劃處出，安由雙方之勝詢人員討論，央社電　海通社說，據此間所獲報告稱：羅斯福與邱吉爾在海達公園之三日以備會議，巳引起一般對英美變方奎貝克會議目的之臆測之新動力。謠言中每述及反軸心國侵歐之舉，惟關於反軸心陣營中內部之危機，則更無一字提及。美國報界對此事現仍十分重視，並指出四方各國與蘇聯僅有軍事性質之異見。此項異見於四歐第二戰綫成立後，即可立時消緊云。</p>
<h3>羅馬宣布不設防有三項動機</h3>
<p>羅馬十六日中央社電　此間有資格方面稱：義政府宜告羅馬為不設防城市，計有三項動機，其一因羅馬為天主教之中心，乃義大利及其他各國天主教所公有。其二因教廷處於羅馬之中心，未能防禦空襲，義大利為教廷之利益計，故有此項決定。其三因羅馬城有其獨特之．歷史，城內又多藝術紀念品，故已成為整個文明世界文明之珍貴財產自文化之立塲言，英美之轟炸可謂不顯羞恥，然由於其被壞之程度，已使義國不得不採取第一步行動。</p>

<p>米蘭十六日中央社電</p>
<p>據本日透露：英空軍於星期六晚再襲米蘭市，此次襲擊係特別對於該市之西南部及某處近郊施行</p>

<h3>新國民運動綱要</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>第三講大意</p>
<p>新國民遝動有三民全義做最高目標，我們知所致力了，然而我們要實行三民主義，不只要有專門學問，尤其要有修養，所以第四條以下指出我們修養工夫，我們如果不能對於修養工夫切實反省，切實做到，則我們決不配做三民主義的信徒，也就決不配實行新國民運動，做大東亞戰爭中一個強有力的分子。</p>
<p>從第四條至第八條，都是指出我們修養工夫，其中第四條是總，第五條以下是分。</p>
<p>貢獻要多享受要少</p>
<p>第四條指出我們首先要倡導公而忘私的精神，個人對於國家買獻要多享受要少，平日嗇一己以裕國家，臨難則犧牲一己以救國家，上頭說過，個人之於國家，猶細胞之於全體，固然細胞強健，全體始能強健，然而強健的細胞存在於強健的全體，細胞不能離全體而活　，細胞要在全體內為有組織有系統的活動，國家能否強健，就要看各個人能夥按此做去與否、不能按此做去，則個人腐敗，國家滅亡，能按此做去，則個人健旺，國家強盛。想到這裏，不禁萬感交集，日本是先進國，在中國國父誕生的第二年，日本巳是明治元年了。然而國父自二十歲起，致力國民革命，逝世時六十歲，致力國民革命整幣四十年，如今離國父逝世又巳十入年，即以中華民國成立來論，自元年至今也巳整整三十二年了，為什麼日本如此強盛，中國卻時時刻刻有滅亡的危險呢？論者稱道，日本維新往往說廢藩覆幕，這是顛倒次序的，依次序來講，應該說覆幕廢藩，維新的第一步是將幕府的權牽還天皇，第二步是將侯候的土地人民奉還天皇，我們諧覆幕歷史己經值得我們反省了，在幕府將倒未倒的時候，法國政府曾示意以兵力援助，如果幕府當時也和我們的曾文正李文忠一樣，受英國的兵力援助，那麼覆幕歷史未見得如此簡單，然而當時的慕府　　犧牲累世相傳的權勢，以一列侯歸第，而決不肯借外國的兵力援助，以維持其權勢於不墮，這新犧牲自已以為國家的精神，使得覆幕的歷史趕快終了，使得全國一致發奮自強的歷史趕快展開，這種公而忘私的精神，實在令我們無窮敬仰。</p>
<p>廢除封建國家統一</p>
<p>至於廢藩則尤其令我們由敬仰而為感慨淋漓之極之。四百多個放侯，以長薩土佐肥前四藩為領導，奉表天皇，稱尺土一民，皆非已有，敬以奉還天皇，諸生須知道，封建制度不是容易劃除的．第二講裏曾經講過，歌洲十八世紀的封建革命，端的殺人盈野，流血成河，而日本呢，因為舉國一至亟亟於發奮自強，知道不劃除封建制度，則國家不能統一，國家不能統一，則不能對外，於是毅然決然由封建制度者本身起來劃除封建制度，諸生須知道日本的封建制度，有深長的歷史，四百多諸侯都是累世相傳以采邑內的土地人民為其私有，其所謂惟辟作福，惟辟作威，惟辟在所不　，覆幕時代犧牲自已的只是一個大將軍及其僚屬，廢藩期代，犧牲自已的卻是四百多個諸候，這樣一來，公而往私的精神，便普遍於全國了。人人都以最純潔最熱烈的心情，向著發　自強，對世界爭取自由平等的前途遇步前進，所以自從明治元二年把覆幕廢藩兩　大戲匆匆演畢，以後日本全國所孜孜矻矻的只是怎樣改革內政，怎樣振興實業，怎樣充實陸海軍，怎樣　能在東亞占先著，怎樣　能在世界爭取一等國的地位，在這大目的之下，一切人民的力量都集中使用於此，一切人民本身利益都為此而犧牲，這樣這樣，維新事業怎能不快快的告成呢？日本國勢怎能不蒸蒸日上呢？</p>
<p>公而忘私一起努力</p>
<p>中國怎樣啊，自從秦始皇時代封建制度已經廢除了，可是制度廢除，思想並沒廢除，試看民國成立以來，所謂軍閥也者。帶着些兵，少的佔1賓，多的兩省以上，本來不是封建諸侯，卻欲把這者內的土地人民看成私有，抓住不放，一絲絲扣緊，一滴滴吃光，直至遇着別一個帶兵的來了，打敗一了仗，還從從容　容把地皮放在荷包裏，溜到租界住着洋樓，可憐整整廿年是這樣混下去，直至九一八事變，在精誠團結共赴國難之下，這種思想，還牢不可破，所謂軍閥也者，旣是如此，那些夠不上軍閥的，在思想上並無二致，抓住一師的兵，便以這一師為其私勢力，抓住一旅如此，一團如此，下至一營一連一排也是如此，學閥亦然，抓住一校，便以這一校為其私有勢力，財閥亦然，抓住一銀行，便以這一銀生為其私有勢力，這樣這樣，中華民國遂淪落到這般田地」。然則就日本維新所以成功，可以下一斷語曰公而忘私，中國革命所以不成功，可以下一斷語曰私而忘公，國父臨終狠痛苦的說「現在革命尚未成功」，怎樣纔能成功呢？我帶着血和淚一句話，自公而忘私始。</p>
<p>還都以來，每一個和平運動的同志，捫心自問，私而忘公的走開去，公而忘私的來一起努力，以死為度，有了公而忘私的精神，便可以和他研究第五條以下了，第四條所注重的是個人對於國家應該公而忘私，第五條所注重的是怎樣使人入皆能公而忘私，如果說公而忘私的是好人，私而忘公的是　人，那麼首先要自己好，也要別人好，這所謂仁，仁不是姑息，是要自己好也要別人好，為什麼聞人善則喜，聞人過則悲呢？因為要好的原故。同時首先要不許自己壞，也不許別人壞，這所謂嚴，嚴不是刻薄，是不許自己壞，也不許別人壞，為什麼善善要能用，惡惡要能去呢？因為不許壞的原故。仁輿嚴相為表裏的，對好人愛護，就是對壞人痛絕，對壞人縱容，就是對好人　賊。好壞從那裏分別呢？公而忘私是好人，私而忘公是壞人，這在倫理上在政治上，在經濟上，都是確切不移的。</p>

<p>交通銀行奉令辦理之農貸工作，自木年五月五日成立農業經濟處，並先後在南京，蕪湖，嘉興。東合四區分別設立襲業經濟辦事處以來，進行尚稱順利。農塲貸款及合作社貸款事工，尤著成給。至於增產貸款，倉庫貸款合作金庫，土地金融貸款，及農林漁牧企業貸欽等各項工作新計劃，現已擬定，一俟部署完竣，即將付諸實施。</p>
<p>查交通銀行為辦理農貸，曾就蘇浙皖三省農業狀况，作實地調查數次，因此對於農村交通，現金往來與物資移動，各地金融，倉庫，農民生活及土　暨各地特殊情形，瞭若指掌，乃水改善農村經濟，增加生產，輔導農村金融及扶披樹立向耕農之旨，先就各地農貸重心區進行辦理農貸。在第一二年內，注重信用及生產合作放款，增加農戶經費實金，提高產量及純收益，務使農田經營，由租放而改為集約，使農民生活改善，義村經濟亦可改觀，一二年後輔導成立各縣市合作金庫，及協助成立附屬於合作系統之各級農業倉庫，使合庫制度與農倉綱圖滑配合。</p>

<h3>新國民運動綱要　第二講續</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>個人自由流弊極大</p>
<p>生或者還　問，既然襲有一開主義，那一個主義不可以呢，為什麼一定要三民主義呢？我的答覆知下：</p>
<p>國父遺囑說、「余致力國民革命，凡四十年」，國父在民國十四年逝世的，　如今已五十八年了，國父在自序裏說，「余在乙丙中法戰妝之年，始懷顛覆清廷，創建民國之志」，至乙未年而發起第一次革命。其間由興中會而中國同盟曾，而中軍革命黨·而中國國民黨，名稱組織，雖有更易，主義却是一貫的。試問中國有第二個主義，第二個黨，有這樣長久的歷史嗎？而且三民主義及中國國民黨所以有這樣長久的歷史，決不是偶然的。有些入以為三民主義在民族主義裏注重民放之統一，在民權主義　，注重國家的自由，在民生主義裏，注重社會的生有，遷些差不多是以全體主義的理論為基礎，不脫義法西斯·德國社戰的窠臼。這話全然不對，上頭說過三民主義　　於五十入年　。其形為學說，且之民雜，在四十年前·三民主義演講完成，在二十年　，遠在義法西斯、德國社黨成立以前，所謂窠日云云、無異說參。又有些人以為民生主義·實在受為克斯主義的影響，所以有民生主義，就是其產主義之　，這更是說　，中陶最先批評馬克斯主義的　民報·常時譯作麥斯，對於其階級鬥爭論早就下了巖正的批評。後來民生主義裏·對於階級鬥爭·也不過痛切的針　，所謂民生主義即其產主義云云，不過為當時，以為你們依照民生主義做到已經可進於大同·不必別求共產主義了，語極明白，何致誤會。又有些人以爲三民主義中的民權主義，實在不是歐美所舉民主主義？歐美所謂民主主義，是以個人自由主義為基礎的，而三民主義中的民權主義，卻不是以個人自由全義為基礎，所以不能說是民主主義。這種說法，又是自命智識階紀的人們·以英美學說為天經地義的痼習了。須知道個人自由主義，在歐洲固有其光榮的成就，却也有其極大的流弊。歐洲中吉時代·在思想方面，受宗教的壓制，在政治經濟方面，受封建的極桔，至今稱為黑暗時代。打破這黑暗時代的，是個人自由主義，在思想上對於宗教的摩制求解放，在政治經濟上對於封建的極　求打被，盧梭的民約論，他的社會歷史的根據，是薄弱的·而他的自由思想，却普及於一般人們，因此喚起十八世紀的革命。自法國大革命所謂入權宣言以至各國憲法，關於人民之權利義務，皆是根據個人自由主義出發的，個人自由主義在十七八世紀間，實在有其光榮的歷史。可是個人自由主義的流弊，到了十九世紀，早已破縱百出了。因為個人自由主義的頂點，是否認國家。為什麼他會否認國家呢？因為個人自由主義的理論、以為所謂國家，不過以之為保障個人自由之工具，如此推論，設使國家有妨碍於個入自由時，自然在解棄之列了。</p>
<p>全體主義應時而興</p>
<p>怡怡需時資本制度已代封建制度而興，封建制度時代操縱經濟的是大地主，資本制度時代操縱經濟的是資本家。挾其資水的勢力，役使勞動者，爲機　的奴隸·而以其所　，歸之於已·其專橫　恣，較之大地主更是厲害百倍，一般人痛恨這些　本家，因而痛恨保護這些資本家的國家，於是否認國家，更為激烈，多方抨學，不留餘地，無政府主義便是由此而起的。其實糊塗透了。資本家何以發生呢？由於私人資本主義，私人費水主義何以發生呢？由於個入自由主義，不去矯正個人自由主義的流弊，却去抨學國家，這不是本未倒置嗎？以此之故，全體主義便應時而興丁。全體主義在古代哲學中，巳有提佔的，到了十九世紀之初·電復提出，雖然家數不同，立說各異，但有一個要點是相同的，個人自由主義認國家不過是保護個人自由的工具，全體主義却認國家是有機體，個人不過是此有機體中之細胞。細胞誠然重要，細晌強有力，全體始能強有力，細胞有　，全體亦因之有病，全體主義決沒有否認細胞的重要，可是細胞不能離全體而活動，細胞在全體以內，須為有組織有系統之活動。這一個要點，是個人自由主義所忽視的，個人自由主義的流弊，是否認國家，全體主義却是國家至上。國父在五十入年前，正當個人自由主義全盛時代，人人謳歌視為近世文明之母，而國父獨能看破其弱點，採取全體主義理論的精華，以為三民主義之理論的基礎，這眞是使　們敬服，同時看破共產主義之流毒，早就加以糾正，施以防閑，這又眞是使我們敬服。</p>
<p>三民主義實行方法</p>
<p>三民主義早就有了一個理論的基礎，即是求全體人民之幸福，求全體人民之自由平等，所謂全飲人民，只有國家水能代表，所以遺囑第一句：「余致力國民革命，凡四十年，」第二句，就是「求中國之自由平等，」三民主義原是整個的，就共民族關係言之，即爲民族主義·就其政治制度言之，則爲民權主義，就其經濟組織言之，則為民生主義。譽恕一個玻璃杯·就其質料言之，則為玻璃，就其名言之，則爲林·就共用處言之，則爲盛飲料。我對於胡漢民先生所著之三民主義的運　　，向不以爲然，因爲三個　用得着連　，一個則用不着連環，而三民主義明明是一個，不是三個，但是我不願多所辨難，因為凡是知難行易的信徒·都應該明白行然後知的道理，知而不行，只是未知。如今二民主義，還沒有行，那裏說得上知呢。所以新國民運勳　　中，既標出我們原有三民主義，便接着提出實行的方法。</p>
<p>須要實行亞洲主義</p>
<p>第一條說我們要實　民族主義，須要實行大亞洲主義，這話諸生會　得牽強附會嗎？其實一些沒有率強附會。民族主義之目的。在使中國脫離次殖民地的地位、中國何以陷落於次殖民地的地位呢？因為受不平等條約的東縛，不平等條約是什麼？是鴉片戰爭後的雨京條約，以及緣之而生的天津條約，這都是英美加於中國的經桔。大亞洲主　的目的·在亞洲民族覺醒過來，共同掙脫英美的桎桔·十三年十一月　父在神戶演講大亞洲主義，盼　日水援助中國，廢除不平　條約，這是一貫的琿論，百刦不磨的信念·說到這裹，有足為諸生告慰的，今年一月大日中國參加六東亞戰爭，同日日本和中國訂常協定，提前交還租界，撤廢治外法權，三月底首先將各處專管租界交還。其後由於日水的斡　，法國各處專管租界以及上海公共租界於八月一日完全交還了，撤廢治外法權中，也將課稅權儘先付之　　了，國父所囑咐我四的廢除不平等條約，所益加奮發，向着自愛其國，　愛其隣，共愛東亞的光明大道邁步　進。</p>
<p>實行民主集權制度</p>
<p>第二條說我們要實現民補主義，便要實行民主集權制度。上頭說過，民權主義所注重的。是國家的自由，所以基於個人自由全義的虛偽的民主主義·不是民權主義。所采取的個人自山主義，在經濟上做成私人資本主義制度，上頭已經說過·其乃於政治上的則所謂民主的還舉，全然受了資本家的操縱。選舉出來的入物。不過是資大家的工具，代表資本家，在國會　裏說話。資本家有形形色色不同，因之他的代表·　也形形色色　不同，因之造成紛擾的　政治現象，所　虛僞，其實不只　僞虛而是惡濁。即有所謂無　階級代表存在，也不過和資本代表一樣，只代表一階級的利益，不代表全民的利益，徒然使紛擾的現象，更加紛擾，這是民權主義所屏棄的，民權主義裏標出權能的道理，這和禮運所謂選賢與能相合·必須這樣所選出的人，才能為國家而努力，不是為一階級一私人而努力。在人才方面是如此，在機　方面卻重在集權。五權分立，看似分權，然有一們統率的人，則成為集權了。不過這集權是民主集權，不是個人獨裁。們人　裁，在發揮天才，迅應事機上是有效用的，然而　一弊十，最大的弊是不聞過，凡個人獨裁的人，都是以神聖自命的，都是不善歡人說他有錯處的，久而久之，成為業蔽，一般人見他錯了，口不敢說，心卻敢笑，久而久之，便叛巡有所不顧，打倒有所不恤了，凡個八獨裁的沒有好結果，半由於此。民主而不集權，則為盧偽的、集權而不民主，則為黑暗的　個人獨裁，這都是民權主義所不取的。民主集機的精義，即是「一件大事未決以前，充分的研究，既決以後，一致的實行。」而其條饗的方法，最要的是「時時想着知難行易　勇猛的實行，即是　實的求知之　著。一</p>
<p>實行發達國家資本</p>
<p>第三條說，我們要實現民生主義，便要實行發達國家資本，關於這點，最要說明民國十三四年間中國國民黨屢屢說明中國現在所需要的是發達產業，不是共產，因為產尚未有，何有拎共，共產　對此說明不能否認的，卻尖銳刻薄的說，「發達產業，是需要資本的，然即國民黨為什麼說節制私人資水呢？這不是和對餓肚子的人說節食一樣嗎？」因此繞過來說，「所以先要給達私人資本，以發達產業，等到產業發達了，再來共他」，於是階級鬥爭便有用處了。殊不知民生主義裏所主張的，一面是節制私人資本，一面卻是發達國家資本，民生生義裏並沒有忘記發達責本以　　產業．不過民生主義的目的，是求全體人民的幸福，不是求一階級一個人的宰福，所以資本由國家與合，產業由國家與辦，必須這樣才能為國家利益着想，分出計創的輕重緩急來，這和私人資本主義絕對不同·私　資本主義目的純在賺錢，那一樁產業可賺更多的錢，就幹那一樁，雖然產業發達的結果，或計有利於國家，卻是永不會替國家利益打算，分出那一樁的輕重緩念來的，故必須發達國冢資本以興辦國家，認為最重最急的產柴，即所謂計劃經濟，亦所謂統制經濟。國家把最重最急的產業，自己興辦了，其餘比較輕些緩些的，就不妨放仟私人去經香了。如此，國家握有產業的最大而且最要部份，國家是人民全體的，國家的產業，也是人民全體的，那麼還共什麼，所以有了國產，便不用說共產了。這種計則經濟，實在今日已各國通行。蘇聯只市開始革命的時候，會實行共產，其後知道行不通了，趕條改為新經濟政策，這便是計劃經濟了。其後兩次五年經潛計劃，更是計　經濟，和共產主義不相干。義國德國所行的也是計劃經濟。其他各國最重最急的工業，也本着計劃經濟的精神來施行，計劃經濟到了今日，已無疑問的餘地了，即有慮及國家管理，往往成爲官僚化的，也不過弊一利十，而此一弊也不是沒法防止的。總而言之，由於個人自由主義而來的，私人資本制度，只知道個人賺錢；由於階級鬥爭理論而來的，共產主義，在沒產　候，無從共起，在國家產業時候，用不着再說共，這是極明則而又簡易的說法，我們只有朝看民生主義所指示的發達國家資本努力　去。</p>
<p>新國民運動網要第一條至第三條的大　　括如此，我們對於三民主義所知不多，如今提出來的　一句是實行，第二句是實行，第三句還是實行。（第二講續完</p>

<h3>Further Review of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>In the years leading up to the Sino-Japanese Incident, Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations had already reached a state of extreme tension. Both sides of the economic sphere saw the evolution of this situation as unfavorable to the future of both China and Japan, and they tried their best to seek political understanding through economic cooperation. Unexpectedly, the timing was not ripe, and the incident suddenly erupted, making all efforts come to naught. This is something that both Chinese and Japanese economic circles cannot help but consider an extreme regret, and even the people of both countries cannot but recognize as an extreme regret.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Incident has been going on for more than six years, and now is the time for everyone to learn from the pain and reflect on past mistakes. However, not everyone can necessarily see their own mistakes clearly, just as one cannot see one's own face without a mirror. We are very willing to exchange mirrors with Japanese people so that each can see their own face.</p>
<p>China and Japan are countries of the same script and race, with adjacent lands and a relationship of interdependence like lips and teeth. Historically, there has been no deep-seated hatred like that between France and Prussia. Why can't politics be harmonious? The reason should be attributed to the instigation and alienation by Britain and the United States, but economic issues are also related. Because Japan is an island nation, limited by land area, its material production is inherently insufficient. In addition, after the Meiji Restoration, domestic industry has developed exceptionally. Because of the need to obtain raw materials, it is impossible not to think about the source of materials, and because of the need to sell finished products, it is impossible not to think about the market. China has a vast territory and a dense population, with excellent resources and also an excellent market. However, because China is monopolized by the economic forces of Britain and the United States, it is very difficult to smoothly realize economic cooperation with Japan. This is a major reason why Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has not been close in the past.</p>
<p>In the past, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation was not possible, in addition to being monopolized by the economic forces of Britain and the United States, there was another major reason: the existence of extraterritorial rights. Extraterritorial rights are used by Britain and the United States as a tool for economic aggression, hindering China's independence and autonomy, and forcing the Chinese people to be unable to achieve economic equality with foreigners within their own territory. This is something that no Chinese person can tolerate and is unwilling to tolerate. Therefore, the Chinese people have no goodwill towards any country that enjoys extraterritorial rights and refuse to cooperate, and Japan is certainly no exception.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has felt an increasing need for economic cooperation with China. Even for the sake of laying a permanent foundation for peace between China and Japan, economic cooperation is also a major cornerstone. If Chinese and Japanese people can see this point, they should abandon all past prejudices and earnestly seek economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is still in its initial stages. What the future holds depends on the efforts of both sides. In particular, all obstacles that could affect economic cooperation must be thoroughly eliminated. On this point, both sides should raise their concerns frankly and without concealment, because superficial politeness and mutual suspicion behind the scenes would lose the basic spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p>Based on China's current economic situation, we want to raise the following principles with Japanese people:</p>
<p>We hope that in politics and economics, China and Japan will be on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Economic unification and monetary unification are the main conditions for China's economic recovery. In theory, although it is China's own business, in fact, there is nothing that does not require Japan's cooperation. If Japan wants to help China's economic recovery, it should start by helping China's economic unification and monetary unification.</p>
<p>China's production has always felt backward, and the lack of materials is an obvious fact. Therefore, in addition to controlling materials and restricting consumption, it is especially necessary to actively increase production. However, to talk about increasing production, one must pay attention to technology and tools. In this regard, we hope that Japan will do its best to assist China in this area to increase production, in order to meet the minimum living needs of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The factories managed by the Japanese military after the incident have been returned one after another by the end of last month. However, it is heard that some of the factories were entrusted to Japanese businesses to continue operating during the period of military management. Before the return, the Japanese businesses made cooperation a condition. We believe that cooperation is not impossible, but the opinions of the owners should be respected, and the method of using management fees to offset the principal should not be used to make the owners suffer excessively. If a few people only care about the present, it will inevitably affect the future of the entire economic cooperation.</p>
<p>For the allocation of raw materials, the supply of electricity, and the purchase of finished products for the Chinese and Japanese industries, the pricing and transportation should be treated equally under the same principles. Chinese merchants should not be superior to Japanese merchants, and Japanese merchants should not be superior to Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are a nation that has always kept faith. Therefore, if Japan can treat China with a spirit of equality and mutual respect, then thorough economic cooperation is not difficult at all. Because we deeply care about the common destiny of the two countries, we do not avoid making straightforward suggestions. If we can promote sincere cooperation between the two countries and establish permanent peace in East Asia, would it not be a blessing for the two nations of East Asia?</p>

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Invading Borneo Repelled by Japanese Firepower; Japanese Air Force Active in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Balikpapan, Borneo, 16th - Seven enemy four-engine bombers attacked Balikpapan, Borneo, at dawn on the 14th, but were repelled by Japanese ground fire. Japanese losses were relatively small. This was the first enemy air raid on Borneo.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base, 16th - Japanese naval aircraft previously carried out a first air raid on the air force base of Broome, about 70 miles southeast of Darwin, northern Australia, on June 30. Subsequently, on July 6, they launched a surprise attack on the site again, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and achieving great results. Japanese naval aircraft recently attacked Broome again four times from night to late at night on August 13, and the aircraft field of Peak Hill, about 30 miles away from the site, bombing various military facilities at the aircraft field, destroying 13 of them. The Japanese aircraft then safely returned to base. This shows that Japanese naval aircraft have gradually invaded the enemy's first line of resource areas.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - According to information received today, Japanese bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, fiercely attacked American positions in Wau, New Guinea.</p>
<h3>German Torpedo Planes Fiercely Attack Allied Convoy, Sinking Thirty-Two Ships, Totaling 170,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to a message from naval correspondent Hansen of the German News Agency: On August 13, a large British-American convoy of about 75 ships, heavily guarded by destroyers and gunboats, entered the Mediterranean from the Atlantic Ocean. At about 8:00 a.m., in the area near Alboran Island, 110 kilometers east of Gibraltar, it was attacked by German torpedo planes.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - On the evening of the 13th, a German torpedo plane squadron attacked an enemy convoy east of Gibraltar, sinking 32 ships totaling 170,000 tons. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was fierce and smoke screens were released, it was not enough to prevent the German planes from continuing their attack. Three transport ships of about 30,000 tons, one large oil tanker, and three cruisers were sunk one after another. After other ships were hit and caught fire, German reconnaissance planes reported that another twenty ships had also sunk.</p>
<p>The Power of Aerial Torpedoes Revealed</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to a report from the Maritime News Agency, yesterday's German military report announced: German torpedo planes sank about 170,000 tons of convoy ships near Gibraltar on Friday night. The details are now being investigated as follows: German torpedo planes had not received public attention before this victory, but insiders had long known that these German torpedo planes were active in the Arctic Sea, the African Atlantic coast, and the vicinity of Sicily. For several days, their mission has been to attack enemy ships on the main shipping lanes. These strong squadrons can strike at any time, showing the thoroughness of the arrangements. The torpedo launchers of aircraft are only slightly different from those of submarines or torpedo boats. Their structure is very complex. In addition to the propeller, there are also elevators and vertical rudders. Usually, torpedoes must be launched from low altitude near the target. Therefore, the crew must have great courage and a spirit of sacrifice. Each torpedo plane usually carries two high-explosive torpedoes. Torpedoes have many effects that bombs do not have. The most important thing is that torpedoes can penetrate deep into the water to hit the target. Therefore, once hit, they can at least inflict heavy damage on the opponent. However, the crew must brave anti-aircraft fire to launch at a very close distance to the target in order to hit the target.</p>

<p>Director-General Gu Hai Reports on the Current Situation in Manchuria</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinjing, 16th - Gu Hai, Director-General of the General Affairs Department of Manchuria, introduced the current situation in Manchuria at the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Great Asia Groups Conference on the 16th, explaining the great strength possessed by Manchuria. The general idea is: Manchuria's first five-year plan has been completed, and the second five-year plan is currently being implemented. Manchuria is a material supply base for Greater East Asia, so it will focus on increasing agricultural production in the future, with the goal of steadily increasing production. This year, Japan has set a wartime emergency production increase policy, and is implementing a weed removal, increased fertilizer campaign and a large-scale reclamation of farmland policy. Due to the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production and the thorough implementation of the production increase policies, and with favorable weather, the intended goals have been achieved, and it is believed that they can meet the needs of China and Japan. Regarding the mining and industrial aspects, the current focus is on heavy industry, increasing the production of coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals, in preparation for future development and strengthening combat power. The machinery industry and other manufacturing industries have also been gradually expanding. Manchuria was only a rural area ten years ago, but now it is developing into a heavy industrial country, which is of great help to the Greater East Asia War. Regarding light industry, although it was dependent on Japan in the past, there are plans to revitalize it in the second five-year plan. Manchuria occupies an important part in Greater East Asia's steel production increase plan, and is currently actively strengthening production, hoping to achieve the expected results. Regarding raw materials for ironmaking, some rely on supplies from North China and Mengzhang, but in the near future, there are plans to establish a domestic self-sufficiency plan. The development plans for iron ore and coal are being promoted steadily, and it is believed that Manchuria's ironmaking industry will greatly contribute to strengthening combat power.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River's Upstream Floods; Japanese Army Gains Victories; Supply Difficulties for Yu and Communist Forces in the Wuyuan Area</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 16th - From June to July, the upstream region of the Yellow River was flooded, and the area around Wuyuan and the south bank of the Yellow River seems to have become a vast swamp! As a result, the Fu Zuoyi army in that area was unable to obtain supplies from the rear, and could only eke out a living with the meager resources obtained from various places. As for the other Communist forces, due to continuous attacks by the Japanese army and economic blockade, they also felt considerable difficulties in obtaining supplies. The Japanese army in that area recently took the opportunity to advance and suppress them. As a result, they destroyed a total of 30 Yu and Communist military facilities and residences, and seized a large number of rifles, ammunition, and hand grenades. The total combat force of the Yu and Communist army was 846 people, with 98 captured, 439 abandoned, and 30 surrendering.</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen Changes Route to the United States</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Yu Foreign Ministry announced that Foreign Minister Soong Tzu-wen, who had previously visited Britain, had changed his planned route back to Yu and had taken a detour to the United States on the 12th.</p>
<p>Plague Epidemic in Lanzhou and Xi'an</p>

Since July, it has become even more rampant. The Yu authorities have strictly forbidden the publication of information about this and are currently urgently seeking countermeasures, but due to the extreme lack of medicines, there is no way to provide relief. It is said that Yu has pleaded with the British and American authorities in India to quickly transport medicines, but Britain and the United States have not provided assistance due to the inconvenience of transportation. It is said that the number of deaths in July and August has reached more than 2,000.</p>
<p>Ambassador Cai Visits the Japanese Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Our Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei visited Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 9:30 on the 16th, held important talks, and left after half an hour.</p>
<h3>Battles on the Central Section of the Eastern Front Intensify; Soviet Army Attacks Bryansk from Three Directions; Fierce Battles Unfold Near Vyazma</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - According to the latest news on the night of the 15th, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is currently attacking Bryansk from three directions. It is reported that the main part of the Soviet army has reached the outskirts of Karachev, a railway hub 25 kilometers east of Bryansk, and some have already broken into the city streets and are engaged in fierce street fighting with the German defenders. In the Kharkov area, the Soviet army is currently concentrating its main force to attack the northern suburbs of the city, launching a major offensive. However, due to the fierce counterattacks by the German army, the Soviet advance seems to be extremely slow. The Soviet army has been taken advantage of by the German army's lure and defense strategy, so it must make great sacrifices even to advance or retreat in a very small area. The German News Agency also reported on the Eastern Front, saying that the German army on the Eastern Front (on the 14th) had achieved success in defensive battles west and southwest of Belgorod with the help of strong air support. The fighting northwest of Orel is now becoming more intense. The Soviet army attempted to attack the area on the 14th, but suffered heavy losses after being counterattacked by the German army, and then retreated to its original positions. The Soviet army expanded its offensive from the western and southwestern areas of Vyazma towards North Nero. On the 14th, it launched as many as 55 rapid attacks on the German positions. All attempts were repelled by the German army.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Defend Messina in Sicily</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to news from the Sicilian correspondent of the German News Agency, the Strait of Messina has now gradually become the main target of attack by the Allies, but it is still being defended by the Axis forces. The supply line from the continent continues to maintain traffic. Although the enemy has repeatedly tried to cut it off, it has still failed to achieve significant results.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting Ends; Churchill Returns to Canada; Roosevelt Will Go to Quebec Within the Week; They Will Continue to Discuss Broad Plans</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - Reuters reported that officials in Quebec and Washington have both announced that Prime Minister Churchill visited President Roosevelt's country villa in Hyde Park, New York, for the past three days to brief the President. This has revealed the mystery of Churchill's whereabouts after arriving in Canada and before returning to Quebec on the 14th. It is reported that political figures believe that Roosevelt and Churchill reached an agreement on the most important issues during the three-day meeting, so they hope that Churchill will soon announce several concrete plans to the British military representatives. It is reported that Churchill immediately summoned British military personnel for a meeting after returning to Quebec.</p>
<p>Also, President Roosevelt will temporarily return to Washington and is scheduled to go to Quebec within the week to begin talks with Churchill again.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - Quebec officials announced yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill has returned to Quebec. The announcement also stated: "Churchill has met with President Roosevelt and completed the initial arrangements for both parties to hold a meeting with consultants in Quebec." It is reported that Churchill was accompanied by his daughter Mary. Those who greeted them were British, American, and Canadian military leaders. Authoritative sources in Quebec said that the first stage of Churchill's return talks has been completed, and everything is now well arranged to allow the broad plans formulated by Roosevelt and Churchill to be discussed by consultants from both sides. Central News Agency reported that Reuters said that the three-day meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Hyde Park has sparked a new wave of speculation about the purpose of the upcoming Quebec meeting between Britain and the United States. Rumors often mention the Allies' invasion of Europe, but there is no mention of the internal crisis in the Allied camp. The American press is still paying close attention to this matter and pointed out that there are only military differences between the four countries and the Soviet Union. These differences can be resolved immediately after the establishment of a second front in Europe.</p>
<h3>Rome Announces Non-Defensive Status with Three Motivations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 16th - Qualified sources here said that the Italian government announced that Rome is a non-defensive city for three reasons: First, because Rome is the center of Catholicism, it is jointly owned by Catholics in Italy and other countries. Second, because the Vatican is located in the center of Rome, it cannot defend against air raids. Italy has made this decision for the benefit of the Vatican. Third, because the city of Rome has its unique history, and there are many artistic monuments in the city, it has become a valuable asset of the entire civilized world. From a cultural standpoint, the bombing by Britain and the United States can be said to be shameless, but due to the extent of its damage, Italy has had to take the first step.</p>
<p>Air Raid on Milan</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Milan, 16th</p>
<p>It was revealed today that the British Air Force attacked the city of Milan again on Saturday night. This attack was specifically directed at the southwest of the city and a certain suburb nearby.</p>
<h3>The Guangzhao Association Presents National Defense Orders for Commendation; The National Government Issues a Special Order for Commendation</h3>
<p>National Government Order: August 16th. According to the report submitted by Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Shanghai Guangzhao Association, since the government's entry into the war, the fellow villagers in Shanghai have been inspired. Due to their respective occupations, they have not taken up arms. They have respectfully presented 200,000 yuan of national currency from the association's savings as a donation for national defense. Please grant acceptance. The Chairman and fellow villagers of Guangzhao in Shanghai are knowledgeable about justice, enthusiastically donating money, and loyal to defending the country, and they are all worthy of commendation. The donation is to be handed over to the Ministry of Finance for deposit and use, and the Ministry and the Military Affairs Commission are to be notified separately. This order is hereby issued. Chairman Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<h3>New National Movement Outline</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Summary of the Third Lecture</p>
<p>The highest goal of the New National Movement is the Three Principles of the People, we know what we should strive for. However, if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we not only need specialized knowledge, but more importantly, self-cultivation. Therefore, from the fourth point onwards, we point out the efforts we need to make in self-cultivation. If we cannot earnestly reflect on our self-cultivation efforts and earnestly achieve them, then we are not worthy of being followers of the Three Principles of the People, nor are we worthy of implementing the New National Movement, or being a strong member in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>From the fourth to the eighth points, we are pointing out our efforts in self-cultivation. The fourth point is the general one, and the points from the fifth onwards are the specific ones.</p>
<p>Contribute More, Enjoy Less</p>
<p>The fourth point points out that we must first advocate the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public. Individuals should contribute more to the country and enjoy less. Usually, we should be frugal with ourselves to enrich the country, and in times of crisis, we should sacrifice ourselves to save the country. As mentioned earlier, the individual is to the country as a cell is to the whole body. Of course, if the cells are strong, the whole body can be strong. However, strong cells exist in a strong whole body. Cells cannot live apart from the whole body. Cells must engage in organized and systematic activities within the whole body. Whether the country can be strong depends on whether each individual can do this or not. If they cannot do this, then the individual will become corrupt and the country will perish. If they can do this, then the individual will be healthy and the country will be strong. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel overwhelmed. Japan is an advanced country. In the second year of the birth of the Father of the Nation in China, Japan was already in the first year of the Meiji era. However, the Father of the Nation devoted himself to the national revolution from the age of twenty until his death at the age of sixty, dedicating forty years to the national revolution. Now, it has been another ten years since the death of the Father of the Nation. Even if we consider the founding of the Republic of China, it has been exactly thirty-two years from the first year to the present. Why is Japan so strong, while China is constantly in danger of perishing? Some commentators praise the Meiji Restoration in Japan, often saying "abolish the domains and establish prefectures." This is reversing the order. In the correct order, it should be "overthrow the shogunate and abolish the domains." The first step of the restoration was to return the power of the shogunate to the Emperor. The second step was for the lords to return their land and people to the Emperor. The history of overthrowing the shogunate alone is worthy of our reflection. When the shogunate was about to fall but had not yet fallen, the French government indicated that it would provide military assistance. If the shogunate at that time had received military assistance from Britain, just like Zeng Wenzheng and Li Wenzhong in our country, then the history of overthrowing the shogunate might not have been so simple. However, the shogunate at that time sacrificed the power that had been passed down for generations, returning to the status of a commoner, and refused to borrow military assistance from foreign countries to maintain its power from falling. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for the sake of the country quickly brought the history of overthrowing the shogunate to an end and quickly launched the history of the whole country striving for self-improvement. This spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public is truly worthy of our infinite admiration.</p>
<p>Abolish Feudalism, Unify the Country</p>
<p>As for the abolition of the domains, it is even more so that we are moved from admiration to extreme emotion. More than four hundred lords, led by the four domains of Choshu, Satsuma, Tosa, and Hizen, presented a memorial to the Emperor, stating that all the land and people within their domains did not belong to them, and respectfully returned them to the Emperor. Students must know that the feudal system is not easy to abolish. As mentioned in the second lecture, the feudal revolution in Europe in the eighteenth century ended with countless deaths and rivers of blood. But what about Japan? Because the whole country was united and eager to strive for self-improvement, knowing that if the feudal system was not abolished, the country could not be unified, and if the country could not be unified, it could not face the outside world, they resolutely decided to abolish the feudal system from within the feudal system itself. Students must know that the feudal system in Japan has a long history. The more than four hundred lords had all inherited their domains for generations, regarding the land and people within their fiefs as their private property. They thought they could do whatever they wanted, reward or punish as they pleased. During the period of overthrowing the shogunate, only one shogun and his subordinates sacrificed themselves. During the period of abolishing the domains, more than four hundred lords sacrificed themselves. In this way, the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public became widespread throughout the country. Everyone, with the purest and most enthusiastic hearts, moved forward towards self-improvement, striving for freedom and equality for the world. Therefore, since the two major dramas of overthrowing the shogunate and abolishing the domains were quickly completed in the first two years of the Meiji era, the entire country of Japan has been diligently and tirelessly focused on how to reform internal affairs, how to revitalize industries, how to strengthen the army and navy, how to be the first to take the lead in East Asia, and how to strive for the status of a first-class power in the world. Under this great goal, all the power of the people was concentrated on this, and all the personal interests of the people were sacrificed for this. In this way, how could the restoration not be quickly completed? How could Japan's national power not be flourishing?</p>
<p>Work Together Selflessly</p>
<p>What about China? The feudal system was abolished since the time of Qin Shi Huang, but although the system was abolished, the ideology was not abolished. Look at the so-called warlords since the establishment of the Republic of China. They brought some soldiers, occupying one province if they had few, or more than two provinces if they had many. Originally, they were not feudal lords, but they wanted to treat the land and people within those provinces as their private property, holding on tightly and squeezing every last drop until another warlord came with soldiers and defeated them in battle. Then, they would calmly put the land in their pockets, slip into the concessions, and live in foreign-style buildings. It is a pity that this went on for twenty years until the September 18th Incident. Even under the spirit of uniting sincerely to face the national crisis, this ideology was still unbreakable. The so-called warlords were like this, and those who did not qualify as warlords were no different in their thinking. If they seized a division of soldiers, they would treat that division as their private power. The same went for a brigade, a regiment, and even down to a company or platoon. The same went for academic cliques. If they seized a school, they would treat that school as their private power. The same went for financial cliques. If they seized a bank, they would treat that bank as their private power. In this way, the Republic of China has fallen to this state. Therefore, based on the success of the Meiji Restoration in Japan, we can make a judgment: it was because of being selfless and devoted to the public. Based on the failure of the Chinese revolution, we can make a judgment: it was because of being selfish and forgetting the public. The Father of the Nation said painfully before his death, "The revolution has not yet succeeded." How can it succeed? I say with blood and tears, it starts with being selfless and devoted to the public.</p>
<p>Since returning to the capital, every comrade in the peace movement should ask themselves: those who are selfish and forget the public should step aside, and those who are selfless and devoted to the public should come together and work hard, even to the point of death. If we have the spirit of being selfless and devoted to the public, then we can discuss the fifth point onwards. The fourth point emphasizes that individuals should be selfless and devoted to the public for the country. The fifth point emphasizes how to make everyone selfless and devoted to the public. If we say that those who are selfless and devoted to the public are good people, and those who are selfish and forget the public are bad people, then we must first be good ourselves and also make others good. This is what is meant by benevolence. Benevolence is not indulgence; it is about being good ourselves and also making others good. Why are we happy when we hear of someone's good deeds and sad when we hear of someone's mistakes? It is because we want them to be good. At the same time, we must first not allow ourselves to be bad and also not allow others to be bad. This is what is meant by strictness. Strictness is not harshness; it is about not allowing ourselves to be bad and also not allowing others to be bad. Why should we be able to use the good and remove the evil? It is because we do not allow them to be bad. Benevolence and strictness are two sides of the same coin. Protecting good people means condemning bad people. Tolerating bad people means harming good people. How do we distinguish between good and bad? Those who are selfless and devoted to the public are good people, and those who are selfish and forget the public are bad people. This is absolutely certain in ethics, politics, and economics.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau Purchases Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Purchase Regulations Approved by Japanese Authorities and Implemented; General Chamber of Commerce Strongly Invites Mr. Nie Lusheng to Take on the Arduous Task</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce has ordered the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth currently existing in Shanghai and has expanded and revised the detailed rules for the purchase and implementation. It has established an office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, which is responsible for handling all matters. The office was originally scheduled to be officially established and start work yesterday (the 16th), but because the director, Nie Lusheng, firmly declined the position, the chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tang, believes that the purchase of yarn and cloth is of great importance, and it is not easy to find someone with extensive experience in the cotton yarn and cloth business to be competent for this task. Therefore, he is making every effort to retain Mr. Nie. The establishment has therefore been delayed. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned from the General Chamber of Commerce that Mr. Nie, after being persuaded, no longer insisted on declining the position and is preparing to take over. The office will be officially established soon, and the address will be located in the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>After completing the survey of cotton yarn and cloth stored in the 233 public warehouses in the city, the first batch of yarn and cloth surveys conducted by the Materials Survey Committee will begin this week to survey the cotton yarn and cloth stored in privately owned warehouses. It is reported that this survey will be conducted with reference to the materials from the Financial Inspection Office and banks.</p>
<p>Japanese Provisional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau Formulates and Implements Regulations for Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>After the National Government decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, the Japanese side also stipulated that all cotton yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants and civilians should be purchased by the Japanese Provisional Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Bureau of the China Trade Federation at the same price as China. The payment price will be paid in Japanese yen-denominated registered bonds, and other matters will be handled in accordance with the regulations of our country.

Shops along Nanjing Road have generally implemented this measure.</p>

Today is the last day, and there will surely be more enthusiastic bidding to jointly undertake the charity.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Strengthens Surveillance Posts in the Suburbs; Additional Police Chiefs Added</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Police Bureau took over the economic surveillance posts in the four suburbs of the city, Director Lu Yinghui has visited the outskirts twice to inspect and meticulously plan the tasks of the surveillance posts in order to prevent the escape of materials from the city. In order to strengthen the surveillance tasks and improve work efficiency, it has been decided to add police chiefs to all surveillance posts to facilitate supervision. It has been decided to promote from among the first-class officers, and a notice has been issued to all branch offices to select outstanding police officers and send them to the bureau for examination on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Poor Education Fund</h3>
<p>The fundraising for the Poor Education Fund, which is organized by the Municipal Education Association, has received generous support from all parties since its commencement.

The association will express its gratitude separately and publish it in the newspaper to praise the benevolence.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Hooligans from Disturbing Shops</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the prosperity of commerce in various districts, the Municipal Second Police Bureau has issued an order to strictly prohibit unemployed hooligans from disturbing shops in various districts, so as to reassure businesses and help promote the revival of the city.</p>
<h3>First District Office Changes Bread Price</h3>
<p>The First District Office issued an announcement regarding the revision of the price of bread and the sale of flour with coupon tickets. It was announced in Announcement No. 10 on the 14th of this month. It is now found that the phrase "No. 1 wheat bread" in the final paragraph of the announcement should be changed to read "No. 1 wheat flour."</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association Improves Coal Distribution Method</h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association and the Retail Coal Industry Association have consulted on improving the coal distribution method, which has now been gradually agreed upon and will be effectively implemented. As for the fuel smoke coal required daily by various large and small factories, it has always been entrusted to the Great China United Coal Company to be responsible for the actual distribution, authorized by the authorities. Registration was completed one and a half months ago, with users determining the number of coal kilograms they need. As the distribution of goods for the third "quarter" (October to December) of this year is imminent, the company is processing registrations in accordance with the regulations, and the deadline was the 15th. All application forms have been sent to the authorities for verification.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Joint Venture Company's Rice Transportation: Daily Arrivals in Shanghai Include Rice, Coarse Rice, and Broken Rice</h3>
<p>The first phase of the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company's collection and transportation work has already concluded. A senior official of the company recently told a reporter from the Commercial News that the second phase of exploration and transportation work began in the first ten days of this month. The area of collection and transportation in this phase is largely the same as in the previous phase. In this phase, the company does not directly purchase from farmers but instead transports rice purchased by the Ministry of Food in various regions back to Shanghai for distribution to the First, Eighth, and Second District Public Offices, as well as the Municipal Grain Bureau.</p>
<p>Arrivals in Shanghai Include Rice, Broken Rice, and Coarse Rice</p>
<p>In recent days, rice and grain have continued to arrive in Shanghai daily, mostly broken rice, with some rice slightly polished. The company does not polish it further, as this type of rice is considered to have nutritional value. As for pure coarse rice, the company has entrusted several machine factories to regularly undertake the polishing work.</p>
<p>Issuance of Purchase Orders in This Phase Postponed</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the former Rice Flour Allocation Office of the Ministry of Public Works' Materials Control Department has now been reorganized into the Rice Flour Procurement Section and the Rice Flour Allocation Section, continuing to be responsible for the allocation of rice flour to households in the First, Eighth, and Second Districts. As for the forty-fourth phase of household rice, the purchase orders were prepared by last Saturday and were originally scheduled to be issued yesterday (Monday) to rice shops in the First, Eighth, and Second Districts for exchanging vouchers for rice. However, the Rice Flour Procurement Section of the First District Public Office received a notice yesterday from the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company stating that the procedures for this phase of household rice have not yet been fully completed, so it must be postponed for a few days before rice can be obtained. Therefore, the Rice Flour Procurement Section of the District Public Office did not issue the vouchers yesterday.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Illegal Fundraising Under the Guise of Savings</h3>
<p>It has recently been reported that some unscrupulous individuals in this city, under the guise of savings, are soliciting savings funds from various sectors and misappropriating them. Upon hearing this, Mr. Zhang Yongding, the person in charge of the National Savings Movement Promotion Association, has, in addition to dispatching personnel to secretly investigate, requested the highest administrative authority in the city, the Municipal Government, to order an investigation to deter the troublemakers. He also hopes that all sectors will temporarily pay attention and avoid being deceived.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Non-Allocation of Fifth Phase Household Oil</h3>
<p>The fifth phase of household oil for this month has not yet been allocated. The reason for the delay is that the military allocation group has transferred the allocation affairs to the Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the Business and Trade Control Association. Currently, the committee is still conducting detailed research on various plans, resulting in a delay in processing the allocation.</p>
<h3>Yao Changjun Appointed as Warden of the First Branch Prison</h3>

<h3>Jiaotong Bank Formulates New Agricultural Loan Plan</h3>
<p>Promoting It Year by Year in Key Areas</p>
<p>The agricultural loan work undertaken by the Jiaotong Bank under orders has been progressing smoothly since the establishment of the Agricultural Economics Department on May 5 of this year and the subsequent establishment of agricultural economic offices in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Donghe. The work on agricultural loans and cooperative loans has been particularly effective. New plans for various tasks such as production increase loans, warehouse loans, cooperative funds, land finance loans, and agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry enterprise loans have now been drafted and will be implemented as soon as the deployment is completed.</p>
<p>It is noted that the Jiaotong Bank has conducted several on-site surveys of the agricultural conditions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for the purpose of handling agricultural loans. Therefore, it has a clear understanding of rural transportation, cash transactions, the movement of materials, local finance, warehouses, farmers' lives, and land, as well as the special circumstances of various places. In order to improve the rural economy, increase production, guide rural finance, and support the establishment of farming farmers, the bank will first carry out agricultural loans in key agricultural loan areas in various places. In the first two years, the focus will be on credit and production cooperative lending, increasing farmers' financial resources, increasing production and net income, and striving to make farmland management change from renting to intensive farming, improving farmers' lives, and transforming the village economy. After one or two years, the bank will assist in the establishment of cooperative funds in various counties and cities, and assist in the establishment of agricultural warehouses at all levels affiliated to the cooperative system, so that the cooperative system and the agricultural warehouse network are smoothly coordinated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Flour Mills Have Produced 300,000 Bags of Flour</h3>
<p>After wheat from various regions was continuously transported to Shanghai, various flour mills in the city have recently started operations one after another. It is reported that since the start of operations, the total amount of flour produced has reached approximately 300,000 bags, of which half will be used for export to exchange materials, and half will be retained for the application of household flour in the city. According to a senior official of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, the household flour allocated to the First District Public Office in this phase is approximately 50,000 bags, with a wholesale price of 286 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen per bag, and the prescribed profit for retailers is 2%.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Rectifies Shanghai's Financial Market - Revokes the License of the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank - Orders Prompt Handling of Received Deposits</h3>
<p>Financial institutions originally served to guide the funds of industrial and commercial enterprises. All matters related to capital should be handled with caution, and proper lending can directly stabilize the market and indirectly develop various industries. Recently, financial institutions have often engaged in arbitrary lending, encouraging speculation. Once the market changes, it becomes difficult to cope, leading to numerous drawbacks. The Shanghai Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank, which only started operations on April 1 of this year, stopped accepting deposits in less than five months due to poor turnover, which seriously disrupted the financial market. The Ministry of Finance's handling of the case is summarized below.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, financial institutions are not allowed to provide funds for speculative transactions. Under the current wartime economic system, all financial institutions should abide by the regulations and handle loans prudently. However, the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank, due to mismanagement, actually ceased operations, which had a significant impact on social finance. For the purpose of punishing the enemy, the Ministry of Finance has, in accordance with Article 17 of the Implementation Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, revoked the bank's business license. The bank is still ordered to expedite the liquidation of deposits received, and the Central Reserve Bank is ordered to inspect financial affairs and strictly supervise other banks. If similar situations occur, they should also be strictly investigated and rectified to get things back on track.</p>
<h3>Lending Cotton and Grain - Collecting Purchase Funds</h3>
<p>Adopting a Bill Rediscount System</p>
<p>In order to promote the sales of agricultural products and facilitate the purchase of merchants, the Central Reserve Bank lends agricultural product purchase funds in the form of commercial bill rediscount. Recently, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee obtained the necessary funds to purchase wheat from various regions through this method. It is learned that the allocation of funds for the purchase of cotton and miscellaneous flours will also adopt this system. The implementation method is for the purchasing merchant to issue a bill and request rediscount from a designated Chinese bank, and then the Chinese bank will hold the bill to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount. The Ministry of Industry Determines</p>
<h3>Number of Securities Brokers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was ordered to resume operations by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy. The exchange held an extraordinary general meeting on the 24th of last month to discuss capital increase measures and elect directors and supervisors, preparing for the resumption of operations. Regarding the issue of broker registration, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who said that the number of brokers in the exchange should not exceed 200 in principle. The original brokers and reporters have been reviewed and are generally ready. As soon as the procedures are completed, they can be given business licenses.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Fiber Products Specifications Committee</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the production capacity of textile and silk factories, improve factory equipment, and save factory machinery, several fiber companies in the city, including spinning, silk, and wool companies, joined the Shanghai Branch of the Textile Industry Association under the guidance of the embassy. Now, the relevant companies have newly organized a wartime Fiber Products Regulations Committee. The committee will use the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Commerce's specifications for domestic Japanese-produced fiber products as the standard, limiting the fiber manufacturing equipment in China, so as to save factory data, and will begin to investigate and study the equipment and machinery of various factories.</p>
<h3>Egg Permits Required for Import</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the control of eggs, relevant parties have stipulated that a permit for importing eggs must be obtained from the Business and Trade Control Association. It is also said that this year's egg purchase is expected to reach a maximum of 300,000 baskets (70 catties per basket), and the total amount purchased has already reached over 180,000 baskets.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks first rose and then fell, presenting a revolving state. Compared with the previous trading day, most rose, but some fell. In the afternoon, the market continued to show weakness. Although most people were optimistic, the news was complex, and old and new investors were constrained by funds. The price of gold was slightly lower, and those who held it did not dare to keep it. Xinxin Company, a department store, soared alone. The news of the capital increase subscription was released, and sellers disappeared, soaring all the way, exceeding the 400 yuan mark and rising by another 50 yuan. National Goods also rose sharply. Yong'an Company once touched 70 yuan but then stepped back, losing 50 yuan. Innerwear was within 100 yuan, and Jingfu shirts returned within 40 yuan. Jinglun remained flat. In the textile industry, Yong'an Spinning remained at 160 yuan, with a slight decline. Xinhuo, Lunhua, and Dachina Weaving all rose and then fell. Xinyang and Sino-French rose by several yuan again. Xinya first rose near 110 yuan but then fell back, retreating to within 100 yuan in the afternoon. Xinyi declined slightly, and Xinxing remained at 30 yuan. Scientific Chemical Industry had some transactions, and the market was flat. Dazhong Match was firm, and Nanyang Tobacco Company fell slightly. In the public utility sector, Zhabei rose slightly, while Huashang Electric and Public Utilities were flat. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua lingered around 1,000 yuan, while Commercial Press and World Book Company were both weak. Yongxiang Printing added 80%, and there were transactions. Jinfeng Paper and Biao Xue Paper were also flat. In the industrial stock sector, Xinghua and Dachina Industrial had few transactions, and the market was dull. Kangyuan Manufacturing, Standard Flavoring Powder had few changes. Xinyi Real Estate rose to around 60 yuan, while Lianju Real Estate had an oversupply. Financial stocks were dull, but there were still no sellers. Shanghai and Fusheng slightly rose, while other stocks had mixed results.</p>
<p>Market Summary</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: The silver building industry and Daxin's jewelry gold market transactions were still suspended. There were few transactions outside the industry, and the price was slightly lower, already within the 900 yuan mark. Sentiment softened, and by noon, it had retreated to 880 yuan, a fall of more than 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of patterned silver also fell slightly, already within the 9 yuan mark per tael.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The black market for unified public bonds has slightly declined. Grade C fell from 250 yuan to outside 220 yuan. Grades A, B, and E all returned within 20 yuan. Grade D was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: 300-400 bags of rice were shipped from the South Port gang for scattered transactions. The market was initially weak but then became active. The purchase by foreign gangs was also more prosperous than before, so no one was going up or down, The situation for Chongming corn, which arrived and sold, was soft, with prices within 70 yuan. There was no market for the rest.</p>
<p>Southern Goods: (Dried Lychees) The new season is currently arriving. Due to the scarcity of shipments, the first batch of New Golden Mountain branches only arrived last week with 300 boxes. Aside from self-operated goods, the shops have only slightly opened up. Due to the shortage of goods, prices are more expensive.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: (Black Melon Seeds) Initially, the new crop was reported to have had extremely bad weather in the north, resulting in a very bad harvest. In addition, farmers planted wheat for grain, resulting in even less production. Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and inventory, the market is quite tight.</p>

<h3>Essentials of the New National Movement - Lecture 2 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>The Extreme Evils of Individual Freedom</p>
<p>Someone may ask, "Since we are adopting an open-minded approach, can't we adopt any ideology? Why must it be the Three Principles of the People?" My answer is as follows:</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will states, "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years." Dr. Sun passed away in 1925, which is now fifty-eight years ago. Dr. Sun said in his preface, "In the years of the Sino-French War, I first conceived the ambition to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China." He launched the first revolution in the year of Yiwu. During that time, from the Revive China Society to the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, to the Chinese Revolutionary Party, to the Chinese Nationalist Party, the names and organizations changed, but the ideology remained consistent. I ask, is there a second ideology or a second party in China with such a long history? Moreover, the Three Principles of the People and the Chinese Nationalist Party having such a long history is by no means accidental. Some people think that the Three Principles of the People emphasizes the unity of the nation in nationalism, the freedom of the state in democracy, and the livelihood of society in people's livelihood, which is almost based on the theory of collectivism, and cannot escape the mold of Italian Fascism and German National Socialism. This is completely wrong. As mentioned above, the Three Principles of the People originated fifty years ago. Its form as a theory, and its complexities, began forty years ago. The lectures on the Three Principles of the People were completed twenty years ago, long before the establishment of Italian Fascism and the German National Socialist Party. The so-called "mold" is nothing but nonsense. Some people also think that the Principle of People's Livelihood was actually influenced by Marxism, so the Principle of People's Livelihood is a byproduct of communism. This is even more ridiculous. "Min Bao" was the first to criticize Marxism (then translated as "Mai Si"). It made a strict and fair criticism of its class struggle theory early on. Later, regarding class struggle, the Principle of People's Livelihood also gave an earnest warning. The so-called Principle of People's Livelihood is communism is just a way to say that if you follow the Principle of People's Livelihood, you can achieve the Great Harmony and don't need to seek communism separately. The meaning is very clear. How could there be a misunderstanding? Some people also believe that the Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People is not actually the democracy advocated by Europe and America. The so-called democracy in Europe and America is based on individual liberalism, while the Principle of People's Rights in the Three Principles of the People is not based on individual liberalism, so it cannot be said to be democracy. This kind of argument is just the ingrained habit of people who call themselves intellectuals to regard British and American theories as divine truth. It must be understood that individual liberalism has had its glorious achievements in Europe, but it also has its extreme evils. During the Middle Ages in Europe, thought was suppressed by religion, and politics and economy were extremely oppressed by feudalism, which is still called the Dark Ages. What broke this Dark Ages was individual liberalism, seeking liberation from religious constraints in thought, and seeking to overthrow feudal extremes in politics and economy. Rousseau's "Social Contract" has a weak historical basis, but his ideas of freedom have spread among the general public, thus awakening the 18th-century revolution. From the "Declaration of the Rights of Man" of the French Revolution to the constitutions of various countries, the rights and obligations of the people are based on individual liberalism. Individual liberalism truly had its glorious history in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, by the 19th century, the evils of individual liberalism had already been exposed. The culmination of individual liberalism is the denial of the state. Why would it deny the state? Because the theory of individual liberalism believes that the so-called state is only a tool to protect individual freedom. According to this reasoning, if the state hinders individual freedom, it should naturally be abandoned.</p>
<p>Collectivism Arises as the Times Demand</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the capitalist system has replaced the feudal system. In the feudal era, the landlords controlled the economy. In the capitalist era, the capitalists control the economy. Relying on the power of their capital, they enslaved laborers, turning them into slaves of machines, and attributed their gains to themselves. Their tyranny and willfulness are hundreds of times worse than those of landlords. The general public hates these capitalists and therefore hates the state that protects these capitalists. Therefore, they deny the state more vehemently, attacking it in every way, leaving no room for it. Anarchism arises from this. In fact, it is utterly confused. How do capitalists arise? Because of private capitalism. How does private capitalism arise? Because of individual liberalism. Instead of correcting the evils of individual liberalism, they attack the state. Isn't this putting the cart before the horse? For this reason, collectivism arises as the times demand. Collectivism has been foreshadowed in ancient philosophy. It was re-proposed at the beginning of the 19th century. Although there are different schools and different theories, there is one key point in common: Individual liberalism recognizes that the state is only a tool to protect individual freedom, while collectivism recognizes that the state is an organism, and the individual is only a cell in this organism. Cells are indeed important. If the cells are strong and powerful, the whole can be strong and powerful. If the cells are sick, the whole will also be sick. Collectivism never denies the importance of cells, but cells cannot operate independently of the whole. Cells within the whole must engage in organized and systematic activities. This key point is neglected by individual liberalism. The evil of individual liberalism is the denial of the state. Collectivism, on the other hand, puts the state first. Fifty years ago, when individual liberalism was in its heyday, everyone praised it as the mother of modern civilization, but Dr. Sun Yat-sen was uniquely able to see through its weaknesses and adopt the essence of collectivist theory as the basis for the theory of the Three Principles of the People. This truly makes us admire him. At the same time, he saw through the pernicious influence of communism and corrected and prevented it early on. This truly makes us admire him.</p>
<p>Methods for Implementing the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People already has a theoretical foundation, which is to seek the happiness of the entire people, to seek the freedom and equality of the entire people. The so-called entire people can only be represented by the state. Therefore, the first sentence of the will is: "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years." The second sentence is: "To seek freedom and equality for China." The Three Principles of the People are originally a whole. In terms of national relations, it is nationalism. In terms of its political system, it is democracy. In terms of its economic organization, it is the Principle of People's Livelihood. Like a glass, in terms of its material, it is glass. In terms of its name, it is glass. In terms of its use, it is for holding drinks. I have never agreed with Mr. Hu Hanmin's book on the operation of the Three Principles of the People, because three can be used in a linked way, but one cannot. The Three Principles of the People are clearly one, not three. However, I am not willing to argue too much, because all believers who know difficulty in easy practice should understand the principle of knowing after acting. Knowing without acting is just not knowing. Now the Three Principles of the People has not yet been implemented, so how can one say that they know it? Therefore, in the New National Movement, after highlighting our original Three Principles of the People, we then put forward methods for implementation.</p>
<p>It is Necessary to Implement Pan-Asianism</p>
<p>The first point is that to implement nationalism, we must implement Pan-Asianism. Do you students think this is a forced connection? In fact, there is no forced connection at all. The purpose of nationalism is to liberate China from its semi-colonial status. How did China fall into a semi-colonial status? Because it is bound by unequal treaties. What are unequal treaties? They are the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War and the Treaty of Tianjin that arose from it. These were all imposed on China by Britain and the United States. The purpose of Pan-Asianism is to awaken the nations of Asia and jointly break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States. In November of 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen delivered a speech on Pan-Asianism in Kobe, hoping that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties. This is a consistent argument, an unwavering belief. Speaking of this, there is something to congratulate you students on. In January of this year, Japan and China both participated in the Greater East Asia War. On the same day, Japan and China signed a mutual agreement to return concessions ahead of schedule and abolish extraterritoriality. At the end of March, it first returned the exclusive concessions in various places. Subsequently, due to Japanese mediation, the French exclusive concessions and the Shanghai International Settlement were completely returned on August 1. In the abolition of extraterritoriality, the right to taxation was also given priority. We must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to abolish unequal treaties, and strive to love our country, love our neighbors, and move forward on the bright path of common love for East Asia.</p>
<p>Implement a Democratic Centralized System</p>
<p>The second point is that to realize democracy, we must implement a democratic centralized system. As mentioned above, the Principle of People's Rights emphasizes the freedom of the state, so the false democracy based on individual liberalism is not the Principle of People's Rights. The individual liberalism adopted creates a private capitalist system economically. As mentioned above, in politics, it creates so-called democratic elections, which are completely manipulated by capitalists. The people elected are just tools of the capitalists, representing the capitalists, speaking in the parliament. Capitalists come in all shapes and sizes, so their representatives also come in all shapes and sizes, creating a chaotic political phenomenon. So it is false, and it is not only false, but also corrupt. Even if there are so-called representatives of the proletariat, they are just like capitalist representatives, only representing the interests of one class, not the interests of the entire people, only making the chaotic phenomenon even more chaotic. This is what the Principle of People's Rights rejects. The Principle of People's Rights emphasizes the principle of ability. This is in line with the "selection of the virtuous and capable" in the Li Yun. Only the people selected in this way can work for the country, not for one class or one individual. This is how it is with talent. In terms of organization, the focus is on centralization. The separation of the five powers seems like a separation of powers, but having someone in charge becomes centralization. However, this centralization is democratic centralization, not individual dictatorship. Individual dictatorship is effective in exerting talent and responding quickly to opportunities, but the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The biggest disadvantage is not hearing criticism. All individual dictators consider themselves sacred and do not like others to say they are wrong. Over time, they become deaf to advice. When the general public sees that they are wrong, they dare not speak up, but they dare to laugh in their hearts. Over time, they rebel and care about nothing, and they overthrow without any consideration. All individual dictatorships have no good ending, partly because of this. Democracy without centralization is false, and centralization without democracy is a dark individual dictatorship. These are what the Principle of People's Rights does not adopt. The essence of democratic centralization is "full research before a major event is decided, and unified implementation after it is decided." And the most important method for implementing this is to "always think of knowing difficulty in easy practice, and implement it bravely," which is to "seek knowledge earnestly."</p>
<p>Implement the Development of State Capital</p>
<p>The third point is that to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must implement the development of state capital. Regarding this point, it is most important to explain that the Chinese Nationalist Party repeatedly stated between 1924 and 1925 that what China needs now is the development of industry, not communism, because there is no property yet, so what is there to share? The communists could not deny this explanation, but they said sharply and bitterly, "Developing industry requires capital. Then why does the Nationalist Party talk about controlling private capital? Isn't this like telling a starving person to diet?" Therefore, they went around saying, "So we must first develop private capital in order to develop industry. When industry is developed, then we will share it." Thus, class struggle becomes useful. Little do they know that what the Principle of People's Livelihood advocates is both the control of private capital and the development of state capital. The Principle of People's Livelihood does not forget to develop capital in order to develop industry. However, the purpose of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to seek the happiness of the entire people, not to seek the happiness of one class or one person. Therefore, capital is operated by the state, and industry is run by the state. Only in this way can we consider the interests of the country and distinguish the priorities. This is absolutely different from private capitalism. The purpose of private capitalism is purely to make money. It will do whatever industry can make more money. Although the result of industrial development may be beneficial to the country, it will never consider the interests of the country and distinguish the priorities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop state capital in order to run industries that the country considers the most important and urgent, which is so-called planned economy, also called controlled economy. The state operates the most important and urgent industries itself, and the rest, which are relatively less important and less urgent, can be left to private individuals to manage. In this way, the state holds the largest and most important part of industry. The state belongs to the entire people, and the state's industry also belongs to the entire people. Then what is there to share? So with state property, there is no need to talk about communism anymore. This kind of planned economy is actually common in various countries today. The Soviet Union did implement communism when it first started its revolution, but later it realized that it would not work and hurriedly changed to the New Economic Policy, which is a planned economy. The subsequent two five-year economic plans were even more planned economies and had nothing to do with communism. What Italy and Germany implemented was also a planned economy. Other countries also implement the most important and urgent industries in the spirit of planned economy. Planned economy has no room for doubt today. Even if there are concerns that state management often becomes bureaucratic, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and this disadvantage is not impossible to prevent. In short, the private capitalist system that comes from individual liberalism only knows how to make money for individuals. The communism that comes from the theory of class struggle has no way to share when there is no property. When there is state industry, there is no need to talk about sharing anymore. This is an extremely clear and simple way of saying it. We can only strive towards developing state capital as indicated by the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>The main points of the first to third points of the New National Movement are summarized as such. We don't know much about the Three Principles of the People. Now the one thing we are putting forward is implementation, the second thing is implementation, and the third thing is still implementation. (End of Lecture 2)</p>
