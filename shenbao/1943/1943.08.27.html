<p>社評</p>
<h3>一邊收買一邊配給</h3>
<p>朱子說過：「宜未雨而綢繆，母臨渴而掘井。」治家需要如此，治國更應如此。「未雨綢繆」是積極的事前佈置，也就是「防患於米然」。「臨渴掘　」是消極的事後補救。與其消極的事後補救，莫如積極的事前佈置。當然，我們不是說事後補救是不需耍的。不過，比較上事前佈置是上策，事後補救是中策，旣不會事前佈置，又不知事後補救，這才是下策。</p>
<p>國家一切政治經濟的設施，尤其經濟設施，動輙關繫國計民生，常然需要積極的事前佈置，先確定政策，次籌議計劃，再次按步執行。政策與計劃的決定，必須縝密考慮，從多方面推想可能的發展，而施以適切的佈置，務期詳確周密，絕無漏洞，然後配合忠實的執行，嚴密的考核，於是計劃完成，政策實現是無可置疑了。所以，政府對於政治經濟設施，尤其經濟的，應該多多從事積極方面的事前佈置，如果積極的事前佈置完善，就不需要消極的事後補救。因爲補救與調整，畢竟是中策，其結果政府與人民不免互相蒙受損失。</p>
<p>試舉一個近例，譬如收買棉紗棉布于事，如果在一年以前，政府能够推想共可能發展，即施以適切佈置，那末，各方面所發生的反響，決不致像一年以後的今天這樣的震動。當然，我們絕不是說政府這次收買紗布是不常，相反的，我們是擁護政府在旣失積極的上策機會以後，採取這次消極的中策。同時，我們進一步主張，政府應該重視收買紗布以後，各方面所發生的反響，施以適切的佈置，因爲，在今日不加以積極的事前佈置，縱使他日能消極的事後補救，其結果又是政府與人民互相蒙受損失，又是重蹈目前的覆轍，這是極當引爲炯戒的。</p>
<p>此次收買棉紗棉布，是在取締囤積，抑平物價，而以安定民生爲最終目的，這在政府當局的聲明中，巳經剴切言之。從理論方面而言，我們在人民立塲，自然可以信賴政府的；可是，從事實而言，我們却不能不期待政府嚴切注意社會上所引起的反響。第一，製造棉紗棉布的紡識工廠，其生產是否因此停頓。第二，舫織工廠如果賡續生產，共原料，工資，一切開支，累計的成木與合法利潤相加，是否與收買官價相符？第三，金融業方面，因受過去押款不愼影響，深爲戒懼，今後信用緊縮，是否妨得其他生產事業，難於籌集運用資金，間接促使生產减少？第四，收買紗布的目的，旣是取締囤積，安定民生，那末，如何籌劃合理配給？如何使人民利益均霑？這是大家迫切期待的。前三點，對於國家經濟建設，戰時增加生產，向來關心者，或是工業生產直接關係者，莫不抱着深切的憂慮。他們所憂慮的，當然不是同情囤積棉紗棉布者的打擊，也不是收買紗布足以促使生產事業萎縮。而憂慮的是因收買紗布所引起的反響，政府是否能作積極的事前佈置，而不待反饗的事實發展下去，然後才作消極的事後補救呢？共最後一點，尤爲全體人民所翹首以待從速實現的。</p>
<p>這裏，我們不辭借箸代謀，申述管見。第一，紗布爲民生日用必需品，紡織工廠不但不能任令停頓生產，抑且促使增加生產，產量愈多，流用愈便，價格不抑而平。共原料之取給，動力之供應，交通運輸之改善等等，政府實有妥籌辦法全力協助之責任。第二，政府旣已規定收買公價，則紡織工廠之原料必須同時酌定適當公價，務以原料成本，加工工資，一切開支，與合法利潤等累計總數與收買公價相符合，如果成本總數高於收買官價，即是工廠的虧損，那末，這種虧損應由政府負擔或補助。如果原料價格爲一般物價的牽制，不能照公價取得時，應由政府收買再以官價供給工廠。第三，金融業信用緊縮，爲自身業務謹愼起見，未可非議，可是，生產事業之需要資金者，則籌集困難。在此情形下，國家銀行對於同業頭寸，應有適當的協助週轉，而金融業方面應從嚴密調查，愼重押放着眼，初不必因噎廢食，一律緊縮。第四，政府收買紗布目的，不在持有紗布，而在配給紗布，××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××所以如何從速配給，應於如何收買同時籌議，不妨一邊收買，一邊配給，以堅定人民信仰之心，以實踐安定民生之旨。</p>
<p>上海是中國經濟的中心，其動向成敗影響於全國經濟者至爲重大，自應隨時活用，活用就是積極的事前佈置，這完全是當局的責任。不過，談到經濟問題，尤其是收買紗布對於經濟界反響問題，就不能不牽述到糧食與物價，我們已數四論之，如果糧食問題不能解決，整個物價問題就無法解決，同時，收買紗布官價標準，就不能與糧價與物價維待聯繫，如果紗布官價與糧價物價一日不聯繫，則社會經濟與人民經濟生活就一日陷於混亂游離狀態之中。在這樣情形下，高唱安定人民生活，中日經濟協力，我們實未見共有眞正的後果！</p>

<p>「在那宿命之日受到損害的十九艘軍艦中，十四艘業已加以修膳而龍自力航行海上。其餘五艘中的三艘，即主力艦亞理遜那，奧克刺霍瑪，及靶子船猶泰號目前正在起卸中，另外兩艘即驅逐艦恰　興號，達溫斯號，即在經濟的價値上，其所的損害，亦已不能再利用了。但其裝配的一半以上，則利用之建造新艦。目前奧克刺霍瑪號的艦底的三分之一已　呈於海面，作三十度角度的傾斜形。起卸工作中，先製造艦體的模型，與被擊沉的艦完全一樣。潛水夫們研究這模型之後，沒入海中，閉鎖甲板下的各室。然後在艦體上繫以鐵條，用設置於福特島的發　　徐徐地釣起二萬九千噸的奧克　霍瑪號使其直立，其次，工作人夫乃把與主力艦納波遵，西佛及尼亞及加利福尼亞號相同的所能卸下的東西令部拆卸，移入他艦，把艦腹及其他炸裂的部分完全堵塞，使艦　浮上水面，曳　至船渠」。（翔：譯自八月二十一日西部明日新聞）</p>
<h3>新佐治亞島上空　發生激烈空戰　擊落敵機十八架</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊連日曾不斷奮戰，二十三日黎明又發見敵巡艦七艘在襄怕島附近向北行　，當即出動艦上攻擊機數架猛烈痛擊，重創敵巡艦一艘後，全機安返。是日日海軍戰鬥機隊並分於上下午三度猛襲新佐治亞島，與敵機展開空戰，結果擊落敵機九架。又新佐治亞島方面戰事之重心，已移至孟達北方地區，日美兩軍不斷展開激戰，日海軍戰門機隊猛炸孟達附近敵陣地，擊沉敵登陸用艇三艘，敵陣地有三處中彈起火，並與敵戰鬥機隊交戰，擊落敵機九架，日機有一架自炸。</p>
<h3>傳威爾斯　將被派赴蘇</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　美國務卿赫爾昨夜招待記者時，有人訽及所傳渠曾以無法再與威爾斯合作事吿羅斯福總統，以及其曾　求渠與威爾斯間必須有一人離去國務院之說是否屬實，赫爾全部加以否認。又華盛頓晚星報表示，威爾斯辭職之動極，乃因　於戰筏問題意見不合之故，頃悉羅斯福總統已計劃委派威爾斯前往莫斯科，與斯達林及其他蘇方領袖人士會談，該晚報謂，總統此舉，乃欲遮掩副國務卿免職之事實</p>
<h3>義為祖國利益　決繼續抗戰　並靜待今後時局發展</h3>

<p>內政厲行改革完成復興大路</p>

<h3>對奎貝克會義公報　柏林當局發表評論</h3>
<p>柏林廿六日中央社電　德外交當局對奎貝克會談發表批評如次：　此次會談發表之內容，較卡港會談或華府會教尤爲缺乏，恐亦無若何成果，又因其會談期間頗長，可知英美兩國間之意見未必一致、　羅斯福雖為把握明年大選之總統地位、而主邱吉爾仍堅持歐洲第一主義，考慮蘇聯之要求結成第二戰綫，今後或仍維持歐洲第一主義。　羅斯福曾說明對日作戰，將為長期戰，但擬於短期內決定之，然在任何方而美國均不能貫澈其主張，結局惟有取妥協方策，先在歐洲作短期間有力之攻勢後，再轉爲太平洋總反攻。　英美兩國代表對歐洲反攻作戰意見不同，何時開始總攻，須在下次會談作最後決定。又反袖心陣營因恐蘇聯　出中歐，將觀察蘇聯之意圖，而將對歐洲攻勢止於某種程度，俾由政治方向謀最後解決。　關於歐洲之政治問題，英美兩國爲蘇聯之強硬要求所窘，呼號側重太平洋作戰，故此次會談結果，仍不外爲虛張聲勢而巳。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城二十六日中央社電　羅斯福總統二十五下午一時出席加拿大議會，就所謂四項自由之確立發表演說，其內容不外為討加人之歡心，與誹謗全體主義之自慰理想論，充滿欺騙色彩。渠　「五年前余曾訪問貴國，當時爲德軍進駐波蘭之前一年，日軍攻擊珍珠灣之前三年余曾謂吾人不能不關心美洲以外之紛爭，美洲大陸已感受威脅，今美洲之龐大武力資源商業力與人力，已無形成爲美洲與世界和平所必要之要索」云云。羅斯福復以所謂非交戰之態度，掩飾其自歐戰開始以來於事實上對德義從事戰爭行爲「及大東亞戰爭發生前禁止對日輸出一切物資，其後以所謂資金封存令，對日本公然展開經濟戰此」等事實。又關於此次奎貝克會談結果，僅謂曾商討此次戰爭之共同目的及在短期內實現勝利等問題。</p>

<h3>各區整理保甲　月底前辦竣</h3>
<p>市保甲　員會以書區保甲組織之選　與否，關係地方治安　鉅，為防村賺熟混入各區起見，早經通令各區辦事處及各特別區辦事處，毋實整　各該區保甲，並限期於本月底前辦理竣事在案，乃資限期轉瞬即屆，昨特再行舍飭各該區保甲所事處，務須依限趕辦竣事，不得再行遺展。</p>
<h3>收買棉紗棉布進行頗順利</h3>
<p>配給方案尙在擬訂中</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會，收買棉紗棉布辦事處，自發布第一號通吿，於八月二十三日起開始實施收買工作，井辦理補行登記以來，各棉妙布商人紛向該處申請出寶及補辦登記手續者，極為踴躍，據悉，申請及補行登記決定於九月六日截止，不再展期，逾限即依注辦理。</p>
<p>商店工廠充分配給</p>
<p>上海社云：按照收買辦法，紗布零資商及製造商僅准保留一個月之零寶量或需用量，其餘屬即選章申請出賣，因此在過去一星期餘中、棉布店等競先將准保留限度以外之登記貨及未登記貨出售，以到市價下跌，在製造廠方面，固不能不按法定將限度以外之紗布出賣，但對於工廠本身之生產，稱有焦慮，惟據記者探悉，在擬訂中之配給方案，一旦責施，足可使工廠保有繼續不斷之原料，商店獲得數量足敷配給市民之布疋，至於配給方案，尚在擬訂中。</p>
<p>織廠原料可無問題</p>
<p>商業社云：政府收買紗布條例中，會規定紗廠及紡織廠原料存貨，以不得超過一月需要景為限，本市紡織界人士，以為一月之量用完之後，是否能大量獲得原料，而不致影響生產，據某關係人士云：當局對於收買紗布以及日後之配給問題，早有通盤計劉，對於紗廠紡繳廠所需之原料，決予充分配給，茍不如此，則失去收買紗布之本意．蓋常局對於紗布一項所以有如此措置，乃為調整生產與消費二者間之正當開係，由政府將原料配給各工廠，其製成品全部配與正當用戶，如是物資得以流通，價格不致暴漲，而好商國戶，無法施展其技倆。故紡繳界人士對於原料問題，儘不必抱杞人之憂，不特此也，當局且將　法使各廠增加生產，以適應戰時需要，至於實施配給之且體方案，當局正在縝密擬訂中。</p>
<p>調整價格積極收花</p>
<p>全國商統會棉發專委曾，頃正向蘇·浙·　三會各地產區大量收買綿花，本年度新花已經登塲，該會為使農民樂於出售起見，對於收買價格，擬酌予提高，俾收買工作能順利推進，　來收花工作，極為緊張，聞巳有相當數量收得。</p>
<p>分配紗布籌劃用途</p>
<p>大鑄社云：奉晤士報載稱：商統會對於收買紗布之工作，業已順利進行，一俟收買完竣，即開始實施計口配給。據官方預料，收買工作約可於九月底結束，中日　刀當局頃已對所收買到之紗布之分配問題，予以重大注意，此等紗布其分配辦法，約有運赴中國其他區城及華中本地之配給等項．其末一項，將對上海區及華中各地之統制物價辦法，具有一重要實義，水埠將以紗布向各地易購農產品，此等農產品，即可由常局統制，而華中各地亦可以較低價格獲得紗布。同時又悉，商統會方面在蘇浙皖三省及京滬二市已籌刻一紗分配制度。</p>
<h3>糧食供應問題　研究改進中　八月份米尙在準備搬運</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　滬市糧食問題，現為五百萬市民嚴予重視，惟因兩租界收囘時期，糧食配給機構，新警交替關係，對於採購運輪，配給等種種手續，不無稱形遲緩，此次第一第八　區之四十五期戶口米滯發原因，即在此中央社記者曾訪問負責採運之米極聯營社當局，據稱：糧食部已向產米區收購之米，七月份指撥十五萬包、已派員向蘇州·常州，松江·及揚州等地分別搬運來滬，尚餘一萬餘包，亦將運滬·入月份指撥之米‵仍為十五萬包，已率部令準備，即將派員搬運來滬，惟為應民食急需起見，此次搬運手鐵較上次可臻敏捷，同時有關當局對民食供應問題，無日不在研究徐步改進，及儘量收購，充分配給人民少需要。至於本市1般市民，希望　部指撥入月份之米，迅予督飭米糧聯營計，以最速手續，尅日運滬配給。</p>

<p>第一區公署經濟處米粉採備科昨發出通告：凡麺粉用戶，自堆棧或麵粉廠具領麵粉時，不得付給額外小工費，堆棧或麵粉廠亦不得有所需索。</p>
<h3>物價趨跌</h3>
<p>因常局對統制物價施行有效措置之結果，本埠除食物一項外，其他物價最近均已呈傾跌之集，本埠各百隻商店，由於市政當局嚴正　持前盯　價，及受澈查國積之影響　在最近數日內，巳將店內貨個削減，故近來居民　貨者較前為夥，惟據一般預料·此等貨物或將再跌，其原因為由於囤戶出範，而一般居民在非常期間，對於此等貨物，尚不認為必需．至於日用品方面，如火柴肥皂等，亦因將實施按戶授給之消息而跌價，據除火柴肥皂可望於下月實施觀給制度之外，其他全要日用品，亦有施行類小制度之可能。</p>
<h3>肉蛋價格將予確定</h3>
<p>大通社云：衆晤士雜云常局現正計劉最近上海區食物價格之無理上漲，予以行動上之打擊，對於上務主婦可以特感與　常，即物資調查委員會及其他政府團體調查人員，將閉始研究確定　肉及蛋類價格、　此二項主要食品　曾不顧菜　其他食品跌價，而劇烈上海　，據悉：調查此　貨物之人員，其人數幸由六十人增為一　人。</p>

<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　物資流通以後</h3>
<p>前論促進物資交流的會　步　，為收買、配給與生　，那家、物習波　以後，其自然的結果是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>日本大使館岡　　務部長所發　的兩句談話，可以說是一個最好的答寫。他說：「因過去上海物資賓不能圓滑配給農民之傾向、所以此次特別注意此點、研究如何能直接配給農民，如巢此　辦法成功，農民既巳獲得低價綿布，會然亦將以農作物低價售出；物資交流之目的，至此乃得完成。」</p>
<p>所謂物資交流之目的，就是　使社會人類，互通有無：彼此如能以其所　，補其不足，則物價與民生，同時得到合理的解決。譬如，以棉花而會，棉花是農民種出來的，而棉布是工廠製出來的，如能以棉布低價配給濃民，同時復酌量提高原棉　買價格，　　　注其坐活，則農民不但樂以其棉義低價　給工廠，抑且樂以其他一切農作物，如米麥，蔬菜，某實，大量傾銷於都市，因而解決今日都布中食物價絡高漲之恐慌；同時，本布華商紗廠的一，三九五，六六四枚紡織，與一六，六七五合織機，由於原料問題的解決，亦將一一活躍起來，構成繁榮的戰時經濟了！</p>
<h3>各業公會規定　調整限價辦法　嚴禁變更品級取巧牟利</h3>
<p>本市整個物價局勞，刻已稍入正常姿態。數日來之大變動，復皆靜寂。良以當局對於澈查工作，現已收取著效。一般投機市　深受威脅，無法活動所致·當為為力杜國貨被人倫運出境，或易地隱藏起見，故除嚴令凡移運物資必須請領搬運或可證外，同　並嚴格監視整批或零量物資質携带，昨悉，各　工會咸爲　定商市，　平物價，即將設法調整過去所評限價，特經規定辦法如次：</p>
<p>專晉商品批發者，康將現貨批給本業零售商人，　外人及非本業商人，一律拒絕批給。　零售商門售商品，應逐項標明價格，及須開具出售發票。　各業市塲，不得爲非法買空　空，一切現貨交易，以各該本業商人爲限。　倘因貨物缺之，不得因之居奇，抬價漁利，或變更品級，以及共他一切不正當行爲。　各工廠公司商號，均須加入工會，非公會會員，不得經營各該項商品之買賣。　凡業經評定限價之物品，無論批發或零售商，均須依照評定之限價買賣，不得故遠　如因成本關係，欲變更價格者，應由工會轉請當局核奪，待允准後，始由公會通吿變更，否則作為非法抬價論，依法　威，現各公會業已通吿各會員同業，一體知照矣。</p>
<h3>錢業公會決定八月份拆息</h3>
<p>上海特別市錢柴同業公會對八月份同業拆息行情，決定　存息七元，　欠息三十二元，聞已公告各同業遵守矣。</p>
<h3>抑平物價聲中　股市現况</h3>
<p>查　　　　、自本年上半年，　價格　　，　平　　公司一度為有　當局財團，南海　於停　、在停頓　肉、價格尙　　定·其後當局對　股交易，一區　　　　，一面　佈種種管理　法，乃漸見　　，前途如何，頗為各方面所細心。　時當前之慶市實况，亦為本埠工商各界所急需切實明瞭者·茲特　述其現况如次：</p>
<p>股票買賣</p>
<p>擁某經濟界　威談，股票買賣，本為會法商　行為，而般票價格之上漲，表示社會據繁者之有心於投資企業，故一般曾之，股票之漲價，並非壞事·但漲勞當然有一限度，換言之，即股票市塲上，不應時有狂漲暴　之風濃，否則影響所及，不但足以助長投機，且將害及工商企業。過去買賣股票，不限於純粹現貨，因此頗易使投機商人從中作崇，自當局頒令，限制股票交易必須限於現貨實實後，此種危機，即可避免，而某種股票之濃價，亦不致漲出某種股蔡之眞實教　，是以股票價格之上升，能使游資得一　宿·對於一般物價，可無影　。</p>
<p>今後股市</p>
<p>又　，前次股其因為當局嚴　取締國積過　　　，不敢再從事於囤貨交易，因聲於股票為合法之買賣，途爭相購質，於是股市之猛烈上升，實為必然現參。而此時其他貨物價格，則因政府當局之維厲壓價，及有下降之象，與股市適　選而總，可知股票價格之高漲，與物價前無　接關係。其後政府收買紗在，消息傅來，整個市塲發生動搖，人心虛浮爭相脫手，於是股市卞瀉，亦為自然之理。但至今日，股票市况，在買風復活下止跌　　，此後股市，將不致再呈易漲易落現象矣。</p>

<h3>「戰時世界婦女」座談會（二）</h3>
<p>深刻的英国動員狀態</p>
<p>卜部：英國的實糧大臣·瘋狂地在宣傳着勿糟蹋食物·英國已經開始在動用戰前貯藏的食構了·開戰後四個月，當局就實施食糧統制·肉與蔬菜不易購得·而水果已久不知其味·在此種困古的環境中·家庭的婦女·仍舊絲毫無怨尤地在工作着，她們在上次大戰中嘗夠了·所以這次戰爭一開始·就已經有了覺悟了。年輕的婦女已全部分配於職業部門，守在家庭的泰半是老人和子女成　的母親，以及學生和病人。婦女的動義最激底而深刻的　可說是英國吧！</p>
<p>女兵充斥的倫敦</p>
<p>問：　據說英國已有女兵·請把動員的實際情形說明上下：</p>
<p>卜部：　英國從去年二月開始微用女子。其年齡逐步減低，現在凡十八歲至四十二歲的婦女·即使已婚·倘無幼孩，均在被微之列，未婚者更不必說了，女兵僅就陸海空軍的女子補助部隊一項就有五十萬。這是全部由婦女組成的部隊·在國內担任通信·連絡·衛生·及高射砲隊的工作·穿着男裝褲的制服，騎了機器脚踏軍時的神態，確是英俊非凡。女兵大都是良家的子女。陸軍的制服泉黃褐色，兼之外形不美·所以當初志願者極少　於是勞工大臣員文實傳說。婦女將不久實流張制勞動，這是非常辛苦的工作，不過個便現在能夠加入陸軍，以後就不必幹職工了。這宣傅效國　大，上流階級的小姐都爭先恐後地加入陸軍了。現在這黃褐色的制服，簡直充斥於倫敦全城。</p>
<p>近藤：　美國也大體上和英國一般，陸海空軍採用女子部隊·陸軍計十五萬，最近巳提出增至三十七萬五千人的法案·海軍僅二萬人，作為沿岸·備隊，乘着小汽船·監視潛艇及飛機。她們是在後方服務為主，担任護士或接綫生，以補助軍隊爲原則。最近據說任命女醫生為軍醫的法令已經通過。</p>
<p>美國婦女的戰時意識</p>
<p>寺西：　一般人都以為美國女子是輕浮而奢侈得無可救藥的，可是實際上卻是意外地腎妻良母型呢。雜誌上的讀者顧問憫上時常討論女性所特有的煩惱問題。</p>
<p>問：　美國婦女的戰時意識是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>寺西：　美國的婦女因為教育程度很低·簡直什麼都不知道。聽到珍珠海被攻擊，她們才慌忙閉始研究日本</p>
<p>常日水預備驅逐英語的時候，美國卻正在熱心地研究日語·仇恨也因此非常深刻，在紐約的四千名職業婦女·受到她們希望在飛方面服務的質問時，佔第一位的是兵役志願，而佔第二位的是護士。軍需生產迅速發達的結果，一向禁止婦女勞工的礦山，也取消此項禁例，最近勢力激增的婦女勞工，　說已揭出物　的要求。</p>
<p>近藤：　美國婦女的性給　上次大戰時比較，已有　著的變化。本來美國國民都承續着懇荒者的祖先的血統·有着脚踏實地的進取精神·可是物質文明的發　助長了他們享樂的習性，至二十世紀的初業，逮到了它的最高峯。男女關係的紊亂，和離婚案伴的增加，都是發生於在那時候生長的人們之間。現在的少女們，外觀雖然浮華，可是寶際上卻是極有思慮的。</p>
<p>問：　美國一向是職業婦女　多的國家，現在到底有多少婦女在職業界服務呢？</p>
<p>近藤：　在美國，十四歲以上的女子約有五千萬人·在公司·工廠·農場等工作的婦女有一千七百二十萬人。在軍需工廠工作的也大約有四百萬人，今年更預備動員三百萬人到軍需方面去。</p>
<p>指揮壯漢的女工頭</p>
<p>問：　婦女勞工的數目，在蘇聯也一定很多吧？</p>
<p>尾形：　蘇聯的憲法上，井有女子在經濟上，文化上。社會上·與男子平等的條文，所以沒有一件工作是女子所不能幹的。火車站的脚夫也郡是女人，她們有着和男人一般張健的體格，所以把笨重的貨物搬起全不費事，日本通行的對於女人的概念，在這裏毫不適用。這簡直是女子的中心化或甚至男性化，但在我們眼光看起來還是日本的女子好。可是這全是為應戰時的需要而來的，婦女勞工之數年年在增加着，一九二九年婦女勞工對勞工總數的比率是百分之二七·二，五年計盡實施十年後之一九三九年，這比率已升達百分之四一·六。農塲牽引車的駕駛員也是女人·而指揮　男子的女工頭也數為頗多。</p>
<p>問：　政治及軍備方面怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>尾形：　蘇聯的最高會議中，　邦會議女代表及民族會議女代表，約各佔公體的實分之二十。</p>
<p>問：　為了動員女子，人口政策也只好暫時東之高擱，那麼為積極獎勵結婚而設的費用之出借·和在變成怎樣了呢？</p>
<p>吉浦：　在義大利·丈夫有着義大利的市民權，未超過二十六歲，而年收在一萬二千里拉以內者，結婚時有拉之借欵的資格。結婚半年后開始付一分的利息·可是於結婚后五個月懷孕·就可延至一年半後償付，結婚了四年而不生育孩子，　利息就要二分長子出生後可减去全數的一成，次子的出生可減去二成，三子的出世可減去三成·至四子出生時可全部不必償還。多產的家庭·還有關於學校及其他的優待。</p>
<p>問：　有沒有保護母子的機關呢？</p>
<p>吉浦：　義大利有國辦的毋性和幼孩的保護機關，從事母子的保護，大多是以貧苦的母子和棄兒為對象。我在羅馬所參覩的育兒所極爲宏狀，裏面的孩子也較一般市民的子女之營養爲佳，頗為肥胖。免費的產科醫院也很多。這經費為數頗鉅，全是　政肝的捐款和高昻的獨身稅以資維持的。此外育兒院又把旅居外圍的義大利孩子帶到海岸去消夏，使他們不至忘記可愛的祖國，眞是極盡周到的能事。</p>
<p>問：　在英國怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>卜部：　知識階級認為在現在的世上，就是養出許多的孩子，也決沒有使他們發跡，此自己更優裕地生活的希望·與其如此·還不如　一個孩子，把他健康地養下去。斯以就是獎勵，人口也不繁殖。享樂主義及失業的苦痛實在已經太深刻了。</p>
<p>德國的保甲制度</p>
<p>井　：　法國因爲婦女過剩，沒有賠嫁金就不得結婚，所以雙親都替女兒貯報結婚的資金而窮人家的女兒就靠自己工作而貯　起來，作結婚的學備。法國因爲有了許多小孩，就非把財產平分不可，所以都不願意養小孩，所以法國的民法須得改變一下。</p>
<p>古內：　德國也大體上採取和義大利同樣的人口政策，設有給婚借欵制度，養了五個孩子就可以不必償還。我會去參觀那著名的「母親的樂園」從家庭的雜務解放出來的母親們，在風景絕　的地方　立的舒適的風　中，安逸地睡着午覺，或是像重新囘到家年一般婚戲地作着運動。經常幹着毫無閒暇的家事，主婦的神經和肉體感着極大的疲勞，這種修養實在是極需要的·她們離家期間的家事及育兒，都由婦女國體的人們去照顯·不必担心。</p>
<p>問：　這婦女國體的工作是怎樣的？</p>
<p>貝爾加：　婦女國體實在做着很多的工作。託兒所是由婦女團體辦理的，而在市塲裏，婦女團體也說有專室，敎授烹飪法，並担任家庭煩惱的顧問，每子保護部隨時準備幫助困苦的家庭，其一是保甲的組織，以六十五個家族爲一集團，聚十集團爲一單位，在這裏置一指導者·指導者隨時訪問集團中的家庭，視察家庭的狀况，看那一家人家需要幫助。最大的服務是在車站裏，照拂從戰區逃來的難民。女子青年團旦夜輸流地作着入小時的服務。</p>
<p>蘇聯的離婚和結婚</p>
<p>問：　蘇聯的人口問題到底怎樣呢？</p>
<p>尾形：　在過去蘇聯的給婚如離婚都非常　軍、。要付五盧布　可提出離婚申請·甚至連墮胎也在允許之列。從解故女性的立場上擬訂的此項規定，因濫用者層出不窮，於是當局於一九三六年從事欽訂，現在一變而獎動生育，離婚也困難起來了。</p>
<p>問：　最後　把問題轉變一下，以以敵方英美的防空陣——他們是不是和日本一樣以保甲的家庭婦女為中心，各自看守着自己的家呢？</p>
<p>卜部：　剛才說過，英國的防空監視員和高射砲隊都是女人，而家庭裏也形成防空的單位　有着負實人·各家庭每晚有一人坐在窗　看守着·遇到燒　彈投下時立刻就報告。</p>
<p>近藤：　美國在全國各地都有市民保衛團的組織。這是政府機關之一，由總統夫人担任顧問之職。防空監視隊業有婦女參加，會有一時它會被指斥爲有閒階級太太們的玩具，使得羅斯福夫人不得不退出了。改組後現在由前任哈佛大學的校長朗狄斯担任團長。婦女也担任着重要部門的工作。可是總脫不了美國式的那胡鬧的脾氣。實戰時到底能作多少活動　是疑問。由於物資的缺乏等情形，一般國民似乎也深慼一致團結，硬幹到底的需要　所以也不可過分看輕他們。（木譯自「同盟畫報」十一卷第七號）（完）</p>

        <h1>1943.08.27</h1>
<h3>Buying Up and Distributing Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Master Zhu once said, "It is appropriate to prepare for rain before it comes; do not dig a well only when thirsty." Managing a household requires this, and managing a country even more so. "Preparing for rain before it comes" is a proactive arrangement, which is "preventing problems before they arise." "Digging a well only when thirsty" is a passive remedy after the fact. It is better to have a proactive arrangement than a passive remedy. Of course, we are not saying that remedies after the fact are unnecessary. However, comparatively, proactive arrangements are the best policy, remedies after the fact are a middle policy, and failing to make proactive arrangements or know how to remedy after the fact is the worst policy.</p>
<p>All of a country's political and economic measures, especially economic measures, are always related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and therefore require proactive arrangements. First, determine the policy, then deliberate on the plan, and then implement it step by step. The determination of policies and plans must be carefully considered, imagining possible developments from multiple perspectives and applying appropriate arrangements, striving for thoroughness and precision without any loopholes, and then cooperating with faithful implementation and strict assessment. Then the plan will be completed and the policy will be realized without any doubt. Therefore, the government should engage more in proactive arrangements for political and economic measures, especially economic ones. If proactive arrangements are perfect, there will be no need for passive remedies. Because remedies and adjustments are, after all, a middle policy, and the government and the people will inevitably suffer losses as a result.</p>
<p>Let's take a recent example, such as the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. If the government could have predicted its possible development a year ago and made appropriate arrangements, then the repercussions from all sides would certainly not have been as shocking as they are today, a year later. Of course, we are by no means saying that the government's purchase of yarn and cloth this time is not normal. On the contrary, we support the government's adoption of this passive, middle policy after losing the opportunity for a proactive, best policy. At the same time, we further argue that the government should pay attention to the repercussions from all sides after the purchase of yarn and cloth and make appropriate arrangements. Because if proactive arrangements are not made today, even if passive remedies can be made in the future, the result will be that the government and the people will suffer losses again, and repeat the current mistakes. This should be taken as a serious warning.</p>
<p>The purpose of this purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth is to crack down on hoarding, suppress prices, and ultimately stabilize the people's livelihood. This has already been stated clearly in the government's statement. From a theoretical point of view, we, standing from the people's position, can naturally trust the government; however, in reality, we cannot help but expect the government to pay close attention to the repercussions it has caused in society. First, will the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by textile factories be stopped as a result? Second, if textile factories continue to produce, will the cumulative cost plus legitimate profit of their raw materials, wages, and all expenses be in line with the official purchase price? Third, due to the negative impact of past imprudent pledges, the financial industry is deeply wary, and will the resulting credit crunch prevent other production enterprises from raising and using funds, indirectly leading to a reduction in production? Fourth, since the purpose of purchasing yarn and cloth is to crack down on hoarding and stabilize the people's livelihood, how should a reasonable distribution be planned? How can the interests of the people be shared equally? This is what everyone urgently expects. The first three points are a source of deep concern for those who have always been concerned about national economic construction and wartime production increases, or those who are directly related to industrial production. What they are worried about is certainly not the blow to those who hoard cotton yarn and cotton cloth, nor that the purchase of yarn and cloth will lead to the shrinking of production enterprises. What they are worried about is whether the government can make proactive arrangements for the repercussions caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth, instead of waiting for the facts of the repercussions to develop before making passive remedies. The last point is especially what all the people are eagerly awaiting to be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Here, we offer our humble opinions without hesitating to assist in planning. First, yarn and cloth are daily necessities for the people's livelihood. Not only must textile factories not be allowed to stop production, but they must also be urged to increase production. The more the output, the easier the circulation, and the prices will be stable without suppression. The government has a responsibility to properly plan and fully assist in the procurement of raw materials, the supply of power, the improvement of transportation, etc. Second, since the government has already stipulated the official purchase price, the raw materials of textile factories must also be appropriately priced at the same time, so that the total cumulative amount of raw material costs, processing wages, all expenses, and legitimate profits is consistent with the official purchase price. If the total cost is higher than the official purchase price, it will be a loss for the factory, then this loss should be borne or subsidized by the government. If the price of raw materials is constrained by general prices and cannot be obtained at the official price, the government should purchase them and then supply them to the factories at the official price. Third, the credit crunch in the financial industry is not to be criticized for its own business prudence, but it is difficult for production enterprises that need funds to raise them. In this case, the national bank should provide appropriate assistance to the interbank call money market, and the financial industry should focus on strict investigation and prudent lending, without abandoning food because of choking, and imposing a uniform credit crunch. Fourth, the government's purpose in purchasing yarn and cloth is not to hold yarn and cloth, but to distribute yarn and cloth. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××Therefore, how to distribute them as soon as possible should be planned at the same time as how to purchase them. It is advisable to buy and distribute simultaneously to strengthen the people's faith and to practice the purpose of stabilizing the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of China's economy, and its trends and successes or failures have a significant impact on the national economy, so it should be used flexibly at any time. Flexible use is a proactive arrangement, which is entirely the responsibility of the authorities. However, when it comes to economic issues, especially the impact of the purchase of yarn and cloth on the economic sector, it is impossible not to mention food and prices. We have discussed it several times. If the food problem cannot be solved, the entire price problem cannot be solved. At the same time, the official price standard for the purchase of yarn and cloth cannot be linked to food prices and prices. If the official price of yarn and cloth is not linked to food prices and prices for one day, then the social economy and the people's economic life will be in a state of chaos and alienation for one day. In this case, to advocate the stabilization of the people's lives and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, we have not seen any real consequences!</p>

<h3>Regiment Commander Ma Wenda Dies Heroically in Battle</h3>
<p>Jinan, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Third Army of General Wu Huawen's forces engaged in continuous fierce battles with the 115th Division of the Shandong Communist Army for eight days, and finally completely defeated them. There were many events worth recording during this Communist suppression battle. In particular, Colonel Ma Wenyuan, Regiment Commander of the 9th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of the Army, personally led the battle and died heroically, which was the most tragic. At noon on the 17th, approximately 3,000 members of the Communist Army's 150th Division arrived near the Lujia Yao area. Colonel Ma Wenyuan immediately led his troops to meet the attack and fought fiercely with the several times larger Communist Army. The enemy's attack was extremely tenacious. After Colonel Ma's troops ran out of bullets, they replaced them with stones and continued to fight to the death. As the battle line gradually approached, Ma and his subordinates charged into the Communist Army's ranks with bayonets, stabbing seven Communist bandits to death, before falling in battle from being shot. His subordinates, spurred on by the regiment commander's death, launched a fierce attack, and the Communist Army was unable to withstand the attack and fled. Colonel Ma's troops completely accomplished their mission. A Japanese unit was extremely moved upon hearing of Colonel Ma's death and presented a sum of money. Colonel Ma Wenyuan was from Linyi County, Shandong Province, 38 years old this year, and a graduate of the Third Route Education Corps.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>On the day the Greater East Asia War broke out, the American fleet at Pearl Harbor was severely damaged by the Japanese air force. The American magazine "Life" (published on June 14), which recently arrived in the Argentine capital, published photos of "The Salvage Operation at Pearl Harbor," with the following description:</p>
<p>"Of the nineteen warships damaged on that fateful day, fourteen have already been repaired and are sailing the seas under their own power. The remaining five, the battleships Arizona and Oklahoma, and the target ship Utah, are currently being salvaged. The economic value of the other two, the destroyers Cassin and Downes, cannot be exploited anymore. However, more than half of their equipment will be used to build new ships. Currently, one-third of the bottom of the Oklahoma is visible above the sea, tilted at a 30-degree angle. In the salvage operation, a model of the ship is first created, exactly the same as the sunk ship. After divers study this model, they dive into the sea and seal the rooms below the deck. Then, iron bars are tied to the ship's body, and the 29,000-ton Oklahoma is slowly lifted upright using a facility on Ford Island. Next, workers dismantle all removable objects, similar to those on the battleships Nevada, West Virginia, California, and transfer them to other ships. The ship's hull and other shattered parts are completely blocked, allowing the ship to float on the surface and be towed to the canal."

<h3>It is Rumored that Welles Will Be Sent to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) During a reception for reporters last night, US Secretary of State Hull denied rumors that he had told President Roosevelt that he could no longer work with Welles, and that he had asked that either he or Welles had to leave the State Department. The Washington Evening Star reported that the reason for Welles' resignation was due to disagreement over the war effort.

<h3>For the Interests of the Fatherland, Italy Decides to Continue the War and Wait Patiently for Future Developments</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) Italian authorities declared that Italy is now awaiting further developments with an extremely calm attitude, but is determined to continue the war to protect the interests of Italy.

<p>Complete Restoration Through Internal Reform</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) A month has passed since the fall of the Fascists in Italy. The Stefani Agency stated that Marshal Badoglio has completed the road to restoring freedom and adjusting the leadership in the new administration in this month. All steps have been completed while the war continues, and the war will continue. The current government needs the cooperation of the people to protect the interests of the country more than ever. The Italian newspapers praised the government's achievements in four weeks. Because of Italy's difficult situation, reforms have been successfully carried out, which is historically unprecedented. Now, the responsibility of the Italian people is to cooperate with the government to avoid the country from falling into chaos.

<h3>Berlin Authorities Comment on the Quebec Conference Communiqué</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) German diplomatic authorities issued the following comments on the Quebec Conference: The content released at this conference was even more lacking than the Casablanca Conference or the Washington Conference. It is feared that there are not many results. Because the conference period was quite long, it can be seen that the opinions between Britain and the United States are not necessarily consistent. Although Roosevelt wanted to secure the presidential position in next year's election, Churchill still insisted on the Europe First doctrine. Considering the Soviet Union's request to form a second front, he may still maintain the Europe First doctrine in the future. Roosevelt explained that the war against Japan would be a long-term war, but he intended to decide it in the short term. However, in any case, the United States cannot implement its claims, and the result is only to take a compromise approach. First, launch a short-term and powerful offensive in Europe, and then turn to a general counteroffensive in the Pacific. The British and American representatives have different opinions on the counteroffensive operations in Europe. When to start the general offensive must be decided at the next conference. In addition, the anti-Axis camp is afraid that the Soviet Union will break out in Central Europe. It will observe the Soviet Union's intentions and stop the offensive against Europe to a certain extent in order to seek a final solution in a political direction. Regarding the political issues in Europe, the British and American countries were embarrassed by the Soviet Union's tough demands and called for focusing on the Pacific theater. Therefore, the results of this conference are still nothing more than a bluff.</p>
<h3>Rome is Undefended: In Negotiations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Washington report, US Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that the United States has had discussions with the Vatican regarding the issue of an undefended Rome, but no results have yet been achieved.</p>
<h3>Former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Arrested, Shot and Killed While Attempting to Escape</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) The official communiqué issued by the Stefani Agency stated: "The Italian Army Police discovered a serious corruption incident in a government-managed agency, involving the former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party, Muti. Therefore, Muti was arrested near Fregene on the night of August 20. When the police were escorting Muti back to camp, someone opened fire on the escorting police officers in the forest. Muti took advantage of the chaos to escape, but was chased and shot dead by the police."</p>
<h3>Attending the Canadian Parliament, Roosevelt's Speech Consisted Entirely of Flattery to Canadians</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Canadian capital, President Roosevelt arrived in Ottawa yesterday after the conclusion of his meeting with Prime Minister Churchill in Quebec. Ottawa declared a three-and-a-half-hour holiday to celebrate the US President's visit.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th (Central News Agency) - President Roosevelt attended the Canadian Parliament at 1:00 PM on the 25th and gave a speech on the so-called establishment of the Four Freedoms. The content of the speech consisted entirely of flattering Canadians and a self-consoling idealism of slandering totalitarianism, full of deceptive color. He said, "Five years ago, I visited your country. At that time, it was one year before the German army entered Poland and three years before the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor. I said that we cannot but be concerned about disputes outside the Americas, and the American continent has felt the threat. Today, the vast military resources, commercial power, and human resources of the Americas have been formed as necessary elements for the peace of the Americas and the world," and so on. Roosevelt also used a so-called non-belligerent attitude to conceal the fact that he had been engaged in war activities against Germany and Italy since the beginning of the European War and that "before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he prohibited the export of all materials to Japan, and then openly launched an economic war against Japan with the so-called capital freezing order." Regarding the results of the Quebec meeting, he only said that they had discussed the common goals of the war and the realization of victory in the short term.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency military correspondent Setoris wrote: The great summer battle on the Eastern Front has entered its eighth week, and the Soviet army is launching an offensive in the south with all its strength, especially the Mius front, which is under the heaviest pressure. The large-scale offensives launched by the Soviet army in recent days have two goals: one is to attempt to advance westward from Voroshilovgrad. Although the Soviet army has tanks and aircraft to assist in the battle there, it was severely damaged and repelled by our army on the 24th, and the Soviet army has made no progress. The other is that the Soviet army further south is attempting to advance southwest to break through the German positions, but it has been frustrated by the German counterattack, but the entire Mius front is still in fierce fighting.</p>

<h3>North China New People's Society Launches New National Movement</h3>
<p>The North China New People's Society plans to launch a new national movement throughout North China from the 25th of this month to the end of October as the first phase, and from November 1st to January 9th next year as the second phase, to advance towards the four major goals of completing the suppression of communists and building the country, increasing production to save the people, rectifying thought, and reforming life. The key points of its implementation are as follows:</p>
<p>Suppress Communists and Build the Country</p>
<p>Based on the independent stance of building the country, thoroughly suppress the communists, and use the awareness of building the country to overcome the communist party's party consciousness, class consciousness, and inappropriate national consciousness. At the same time, based on this stance, actively develop the society's performance, use thought to deal with thought, use organization to deal with organization, and use strength to deal with strength, to completely eradicate the communist disaster.</p>
<p>To implement the suppression of communists, it is necessary to carry out a political and ideological struggle against the communists, and first of all, strengthen the subjective awareness of building the country. The method of promotion is to take counties and cities as units and strive to carry out rural construction. In order to strengthen the New National Movement's camp and promote the task of suppressing communists and building the country, implement special training for government officials, teachers, branch chiefs, baojia chiefs, youth groups, self-defense corps, and other workers in various departments, and continue the three-clean movement of cleaning the countryside, cleaning the government, and cleaning up drugs. The New People's Society will first take the lead in practicing this, in order to actively develop it. In order to strengthen the New People's Society's camp during this period, and to re-launch the New People's Society's movement, increase the number of branches, develop local work by peripheral mass organizations, and organize an anti-communist grand alliance to strengthen the anti-communist function, unify the guidance of youth and women's movements, operate committees at all levels, and popularize self-defense work to make it an elite organization of the New People's Society movement, and strengthen the training and organization of New People's Work Pioneers, increase the rural information network, and maintain close contact with the government, security forces, anti-communist committees, road protection work, cooperatives, labor organizations, etc., to give full play to organic operation.</p>
<p>Increase Production to Save the People</p>
<p>Plan to ensure increased agricultural production and low-price policies, support the government's food policy, eliminate improper acts, and reduce losses for producers and consumers. Pay special attention to the revitalization of rural areas and the return of farmers to their hometowns, and move towards rural construction and the establishment of a new economic system.</p>
<p>The method of implementation is to mobilize organizations and groups at all levels to lead the masses to cooperate with the food policy, and smoothly and reasonably solve the problems of purchase prices, circulation, and distribution from production to consumption. Give full play to the power of mass organizations, enlighten representatives of joint councils and various groups in various places, and automatically organize "National Production Increase and People's Saving Movement Cooperation Committees" to clarify the actual situation of improper acts such as extortion, embezzlement, speculation, manipulation, and hoarding, discuss the situation of food purchase work, and the impact after the implementation of the policy, and gradually improve it.</p>
<p>Rectify Thought</p>
<p>Thoroughly understand Japan's new policy towards China, cite Japan's repeated declarations, Prime Minister Dong's policy speech, the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the concrete facts of assisting China's independence and autonomy, expand propaganda in peaceful areas, indirectly promote the enemy's reflection, and use it to advance towards the goal of peaceful unification, rejuvenating Asia, and building the country.</p>
<p>The method of implementation is to launch a powerful ideological propaganda war that is consistent between the Political Affairs Committee and the New People's Society, unify the guidance of various cultural groups, and form a wartime cultural alliance. Show the enemy's soldiers and civilians concrete facts and make them cooperate in the construction of a new China and the holy war of East Asian liberation. Implement national training work. Universally establish compulsory literacy night schools and launch a national weaving movement.</p>
<p>Reform Life</p>
<p>Implement the general mobilization of the national spirit and material resources to build a new China. Current work should focus on reforming the accumulated habits of extravagance, laziness, decadence, and addiction, and promote China's inherent culture and develop vast lands and abundant resources. Propose the six standards of the New National Movement: loyalty to the country, love of East Asia, emphasis on morality, advocacy of diligence and thrift, responsibility, and discipline.</p>
<p>The method of implementation is to contact various agencies, groups, and schools to make their own regulations for implementing a new life, and to have leaders first practice it to cultivate a trend. First, focus on the activities of youth groups, launch a diligent labor service movement to serve the country, and establish a labor mobilization system that gradually spreads to the masses. Launch a women's movement to reform family life and cultivate good customs such as diligence, simplicity, frugality, and cleanliness. Promote the rationalization of national life, and strive to advocate air defense, anti-espionage, and the recovery of waste, copper, and iron movements, gradually reform the superstitious customs in rural areas, vigorously carry out anti-drug movements, and eliminate bad habits such as prostitution and gambling. Understand the true meaning of the new policy towards China, and maintain love and courtesy towards the Japanese in life and "strictly abide by the time and question sentences" and other movements.

<h3>Reorganization of Baojia in Various Districts to be Completed Before the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Baojia Committee believes that the selection of Baojia organizations in various districts is crucial to local security. To prevent cunning villagers from mixing into various districts, it has already issued a notice to the offices in various districts and special districts, requiring them to reorganize the Baojia in their respective districts and set a deadline for completion by the end of this month. As the deadline is approaching, it has again issued a reminder to the Baojia offices in various districts to complete the work on time and not to delay it any further.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Progresses Smoothly</h3>
<p>Allocation Plan Still Being Drafted</p>
<p>Since the National Commercial Control Association's office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth issued its first announcement and began implementing the purchase work on August 23rd, and handled supplementary registrations, cotton yarn and cloth merchants have enthusiastically applied to the office to sell their goods and complete supplementary registration procedures. It is understood that the deadline for applications and supplementary registrations is set for September 6th and will not be extended again. Those who miss the deadline will be handled according to the regulations.</p>
<p>Full Allocation to Shops and Factories</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports: According to the purchase method, yarn and cloth retailers and manufacturers are only allowed to retain one month's worth of retail stock or required quantity. The rest must be sold by application. Therefore, in the past week or so, cotton cloth stores and others competed to sell registered and unregistered goods beyond the allowed limit, leading to a drop in market prices. On the manufacturing side, factories inevitably had to sell yarn and cloth beyond the legal limit. However, there were concerns about the factories' own production. However, according to reporter inquiries, once the allocation plan under consideration is implemented, it will be sufficient to ensure that factories maintain a continuous supply of raw materials and shops obtain sufficient cloth to allocate to citizens. As for the allocation plan, it is still being drafted.</p>
<p>No Problems with Raw Materials for Weaving Factories</p>
<p>Commercial News Agency reports: The government's regulations on purchasing yarn and cloth stipulate that the raw material inventory of yarn factories and textile factories must not exceed one month's worth of needs. People in the textile industry in the city believe that after the one-month supply is used up, it is uncertain whether they will be able to obtain a large amount of raw materials, which may affect production. According to a related person, the authorities have a comprehensive plan for purchasing yarn and cloth and allocating it in the future. The raw materials needed by yarn factories and textile factories will be fully allocated. If not, the original intention of purchasing yarn and cloth will be lost. The reason why the authorities have taken such measures for yarn and cloth is to adjust the proper relationship between production and consumption. The government allocates raw materials to various factories, and all of its finished products are allocated to legitimate users. In this way, materials can be circulated, prices will not skyrocket, and unscrupulous merchants will not be able to use their skills. Therefore, people in the textile industry do not need to worry about the raw material problem. Not only that, the authorities will also devise methods to enable various factories to increase production to meet wartime needs. As for the concrete plan for implementing the allocation, the authorities are carefully drafting it.</p>
<p>Actively Purchase Cotton to Adjust Prices</p>
<p>The Cotton Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association is currently purchasing cotton in large quantities from various producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. This year's new cotton has already entered the market. In order to make farmers willing to sell, the committee plans to appropriately increase the purchase price to facilitate the smooth progress of the purchase work. The cotton purchasing work has been extremely tense, and it is said that a considerable quantity has been received.</p>
<p>Plan Uses for Allocated Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Dawei News Agency reports: According to the Wu Shi Times, the National Commercial Control Association has been proceeding smoothly with the work of purchasing yarn and cloth. Once the purchase is completed, a per capita allocation will be implemented. According to official predictions, the purchase work will be completed around the end of September. The Chinese and Japanese authorities are paying close attention to the allocation of the purchased yarn and cloth. The allocation methods for these yarn and cloth will include transporting them to other areas of China and allocating them locally in Central China. The latter will have an important practical significance for controlling commodity prices in Shanghai and Central China. Shanghai will use yarn and cloth to purchase agricultural products from various places. These agricultural products can be controlled by the authorities, and various places in Central China can obtain yarn and cloth at lower prices. At the same time, it is also learned that the National Commercial Control Association has been preparing a yarn allocation system in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Food Supply Issues Being Studied and Improved; August Rice Still Being Prepared for Transport</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai: The food problem in Shanghai is now being taken very seriously by the five million citizens. However, due to the recovery period of the two concessions, the new and old police forces of the food distribution agency are being replaced, and there is inevitably some delay in various procedures such as procurement, transportation, and distribution. The reason for the delayed distribution of the 45th installment of household rice in the first and eighth districts is this. The Central News Agency reporter visited the United Rice Grain Association, which is responsible for procurement and transportation. According to them, the Rice Department has purchased rice from rice-producing areas. Of the 150,000 bags assigned in July, personnel have been sent to Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Yangzhou to transport them to Shanghai. The remaining 10,000 bags will also be transported to Shanghai. The 150,000 bags assigned in August are still being prepared and personnel will be sent to transport them to Shanghai soon. However, in order to meet the urgent needs of the people for food, this transportation procedure will be more efficient than the last time. At the same time, the relevant authorities are studying and gradually improving the food supply to the people every day, and making every effort to purchase and fully allocate to meet the needs of the people. As for the general citizens of the city, they hope that the Rice Department will instruct the United Rice Grain Association to transport the rice assigned in August to Shanghai and distribute it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Flour Sales Slips Issued in Advance</p>

<h3>Prices Trend Downward</h3>
<p>As a result of the effective measures taken by the authorities to control prices, commodity prices in this city, except for food, have recently shown a downward trend. The various department stores in this city have reduced the prices of goods in their stores in recent days due to the strict maintenance of previous prices by the municipal authorities and the impact of the investigation of national reserves. Therefore, there are more residents purchasing goods than before. However, it is generally expected that these goods will fall further, because hoarders are releasing their stockpiles, and the general residents do not consider these goods to be necessary during the emergency period. As for daily necessities, such as matches and soap, their prices have also fallen due to the news that they will be distributed on a household basis. In addition to matches and soap, which are expected to be distributed starting next month, other daily necessities may also be subject to a similar system.</p>

<h3>Commentary: After the Flow of Materials</h3>
<p>After discussing the promotion of material exchange in the previous article, including purchasing, allocation, and production, what are the natural consequences after [terms illegible]?</p>
<p>The two sentences spoken by Mr. Oka [name illegible], Minister of the Japanese Embassy, can be said to be the best answer. He said: "Because in the past, the distribution of materials to farmers in Shanghai was not smooth, we are paying special attention to this point this time, and studying how to directly allocate to farmers. If this method is successful, the farmers will have obtained cheap cotton cloth, and will naturally sell agricultural products at low prices; the purpose of material exchange will be achieved at this point."</p>
<p>The so-called purpose of material exchange is to enable society and humanity to exchange what they have and make up for what they lack. If everyone can use what they have in abundance to supplement what they lack, then prices and people's livelihood will be reasonably resolved at the same time. For example, with cotton, cotton is grown by farmers and cotton cloth is made by factories. If cotton cloth can be allocated to farmers at low prices, and the purchase price of raw cotton is also appropriately increased to guarantee their livelihoods, then farmers will not only be happy to supply their cotton to factories at low prices, but also be happy to sell other agricultural products such as rice, wheat, vegetables, and fruits in large quantities to the city, thus solving the current panic of high food prices in urban areas. At the same time, the 1,395,664 spindles and 16,675 looms of Shanghai's Chinese-owned cotton mills will also become active one by one due to the solution of the raw material problem, creating a prosperous wartime economy!</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Set Adjustment Methods for Fixed Prices, Strictly Prohibiting Alteration of Grades for Profiteering</h3>
<p>The city's overall price control bureau has gradually entered a normal state. The major fluctuations of the past few days have returned to silence. This is because the authorities have achieved results in their thorough investigation work. Speculators are deeply threatened and unable to operate. To prevent domestically produced goods from being smuggled out of the country or hidden elsewhere, in addition to strictly ordering that all transfers of materials must apply for a transport permit, they are also strictly monitoring the carrying of whole batches or small amounts of materials. It was learned yesterday that each trade association is [illegible] to stabilize the market and stabilize prices, and will devise methods to adjust the fixed prices that were assessed in the past. The specific regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Wholesalers of designated commodities should sell current goods to retailers in the same industry, and refuse to sell to outsiders and merchants outside the industry. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and issue sales invoices. All markets must not engage in illegal short selling, and all spot transactions are limited to merchants in the relevant industry. In the event of a shortage of goods, they must not take advantage of the situation to hoard goods, raise prices, or alter grades, or engage in any other improper conduct. All factories, companies, and businesses must join the trade association. Non-members are not allowed to engage in the buying and selling of relevant commodities. For items that have been assessed with fixed prices, both wholesalers and retailers must buy and sell in accordance with the assessed fixed prices and must not deliberately violate [regulations]. If a price change is desired due to cost factors, the trade association should forward the request to the authorities for verification and approval. The trade association will notify the change after approval, otherwise it will be regarded as an illegal price increase and severely punished according to law. The trade associations have already notified all member businesses accordingly.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association Decides on Interbank Lending Rate for August</h3>

<h3>Current Stock Market Situation Amidst Calls to Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>Since the first half of this year, [illegible] prices [illegible]. A certain company was once [illegible] by the authorities and financial groups. [Illegible] was once suspended. [Illegible] Prices are still [illegible]. After that, the authorities [illegible] stock trading. One district [illegible] various management methods [illegible]. How the future develops is being carefully watched by all parties. The current reality of the stock market is also what the industrial and commercial circles in this city urgently need to understand. A description of the current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Stock Trading</p>
<p>According to an authority in the economic world, stock trading is a legal commercial behavior, and the rise in stock prices indicates that there are people who are interested in investing in enterprises, therefore, the general public believes that the rise in stock prices is not a bad thing. However, of course, the rise has a limit. In other words, there should not be a feverish surge in the stock market, otherwise, the impact will not only fuel speculation but also harm industrial and commercial enterprises. In the past, stock trading was not limited to purely spot trading, which made it easier for speculative merchants to take advantage of the situation. Since the authorities issued an order restricting stock trading to spot trading only, this crisis can be avoided, and the price of a certain stock will not rise above the stock's actual value. Therefore, the rise in stock prices can provide a haven for floating capital and should not affect general prices.</p>
<p>Future Stock Market</p>
<p>In addition, the reason for the previous stock market was that the authorities strictly cracked down on national [illegible] and [illegible]. People no longer dared to engage in hoarding and trading, and since stocks were a legal transaction, they competed to purchase them. Therefore, the sharp rise in the stock market was inevitable. At this time, the prices of other goods fell due to the government authorities' stringent price controls. The stock market was appropriately selected. It can be seen that the high stock prices have no direct relationship with price fluctuations. Later, news of the government's purchase of yarn came, and the entire market was shaken. People became anxious and competed to sell, so the stock market crashed, which was also a natural phenomenon. But today, the stock market has stopped falling under the revival of the buying trend [illegible]. In the future, the stock market will no longer show a volatile phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Initially firm but then soft, the trend is still firm overall. Although it has not yet escaped the fluctuation, the fluctuation has now appeared to be upwards. Credit has gradually loosened and the outlook is promising. Yesterday, Type C initially traded high, then slowly fell back, and finally ended slightly lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Yesterday, nearly a thousand packages of rice from various sources arrived at the rice market, but rice shops were still unwilling to purchase. New tenants claimed to be inquiring. [illegible] The opening price of rice decreased, and new [illegible] also followed. Soybeans and aged green beans also decreased in price. Daily Necessities: Rationing is inevitable, people are anxious, so buying and selling are sparse and prices are flat. Cigarette sales were sluggish, and the combined authorities were strictly inspecting the allocation of goods, causing people to be disappointed and prices to be soft and mixed. British American Tobacco remained unchanged, and Qianmen also remained the same.</p>

<h3>"Wartime World Women" Symposium (2)</h3>
<p>Profound British Mobilization Status</p>
<p>Bu Bu: The British Minister of Food is frantically promoting the avoidance of food waste. Britain has already started using pre-war food reserves. Four months after the start of the war, the authorities implemented food rationing. Meat and vegetables are not easy to buy, and the taste of fruit has long been forgotten. In this difficult environment, housewives are still working without the slightest complaint. They had enough of the last war, so they were already aware of this war from the beginning. Young women have all been assigned to occupational sectors. Most of those staying at home are elderly people, mothers with children, students, and patients. The most thorough and profound mobilization of women can be said to be in Britain!</p>
<p>London Filled with Female Soldiers</p>
<p>Question: It is said that Britain already has female soldiers. Please explain the actual situation of mobilization in detail:</p>
<p>Bu Bu: Britain began to slightly employ women from February of last year. Their age has gradually decreased. Now, women aged eighteen to forty-two, even if married, are subject to conscription if they have no young children. Unmarried women are even more so. The women's auxiliary units of the army, navy, and air force alone have 500,000 female soldiers. This is a unit entirely composed of women, performing communication, liaison, sanitation, and anti-aircraft gun duties in the country. Dressed in men's trousers uniforms and riding military bicycles, they are indeed extraordinarily handsome. Most of the female soldiers are from good families. The army's uniform is brownish-yellow and not very attractive, so there were very few volunteers at first. Then, the Minister of Labor spread the word that women would soon be subjected to forced labor, which is a very hard job. However, if they can join the army now, they won't have to work as laborers later. This propaganda worked greatly, and ladies of the upper class competed to join the army. Now, this brownish-yellow uniform simply fills the entire city of London.</p>
<p>Kondo: The United States is also generally similar to Britain. The army, navy, and air force employ female units. The army has 150,000, and a bill to increase it to 375,000 has recently been proposed. The navy has only 20,000, serving as coastal guard units, riding small motorboats, and monitoring submarines and aircraft. They mainly serve in the rear, acting as nurses or telephone operators, to assist the army in principle. Recently, it is said that a law appointing female doctors as military doctors has been passed.</p>
<p>Wartime Consciousness of American Women</p>
<p>Teranishi: People generally think that American women are frivolous and hopelessly extravagant, but in reality, they are unexpectedly good wives and mothers. Readers of magazines often discuss the unique worries of women.</p>
<p>Question: What is the wartime consciousness of American women?</p>
<p>Teranishi: American women have very low levels of education and know almost nothing. They only began to frantically study Japan after hearing about the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>When the Japanese were preparing to expel the English language, the United States was enthusiastically studying Japanese. Hatred is therefore very deep. When four thousand professional women in New York were asked about their desire to serve in the air force, the first place was military service, and the second place was nursing. As a result of the rapid development of military production, mines that had always prohibited female labor have also lifted this ban. Recently, the increasingly powerful female laborers are said to have raised demands for material goods.</p>
<p>Kondo: The nature of American women has undergone significant changes compared to the last war. Originally, American citizens inherited the blood of pioneer ancestors and had a down-to-earth enterprising spirit. However, the development of material civilization has promoted their habits of enjoyment, reaching its peak in the early 20th century. The disorder of male-female relationships and the increase in divorce cases all occurred among people who grew up at that time. Although the current young women appear frivolous, they are actually very thoughtful.</p>
<p>Question: The United States has always been a country with many working women. How many women are currently working in the professional world?</p>
<p>Kondo: In the United States, there are about 50 million women over the age of fourteen. 17.2 million women work in companies, factories, and farms. There are also about 4 million working in military factories, and 3 million more are expected to be mobilized to the military industry this year.</p>
<p>Female Foremen Commanding Strong Men</p>
<p>Question: The number of female laborers must also be very high in the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Ogata: The Soviet constitution states that women are equal to men in economic, cultural, and social terms, so there is no job that women cannot do. Railway porters are also women. They have bodies as strong as men, so it is no effort for them to lift heavy goods. The common Japanese concept of women does not apply here at all. This is simply the centralization or even masculinization of women, but in our eyes, Japanese women are still better. However, this is all due to the needs of wartime. The number of female laborers is increasing year by year. In 1929, the ratio of female laborers to the total number of laborers was 27.2%. In 1939, ten years after the implementation of the plan, this ratio had risen to 41.6%. Women are also drivers of farm tractors, and there are quite a few female foremen who command male workers.</p>
<p>Question: What about in terms of politics and military equipment?</p>
<p>Ogata: In the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, female representatives in the Union Council and female representatives in the Council of Nationalities each account for about 20% of the total.</p>
<p>Question: In order to mobilize women, population policy has to be temporarily shelved. So, what has become of the lending of funds for actively encouraging marriage?</p>
<p>Kichiura: In Italy, husbands who have Italian citizenship, are not over twenty-six years old, and have an annual income of less than 12,000 lira, are eligible for a marriage loan. Interest of one percent is paid half a year after marriage, but if the wife becomes pregnant five months after marriage, repayment can be postponed until one and a half years later. If there are no children four years after marriage, the interest will be two percent. The birth of the first child can reduce the total amount by 10%, the birth of the second child can reduce it by 20%, and the birth of the third child can reduce it by 30%. If a fourth child is born, the entire amount does not have to be repaid. Families with many children also have preferential treatment regarding schools and other matters.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any institutions that protect mothers and children?</p>
<p>Kichiura: Italy has state-run institutions for the protection of mothers and young children, mainly targeting poor mothers and children and abandoned children. The nursery I visited in Rome was extremely grand, and the children inside were better nourished and fatter than the children of ordinary citizens. There are also many free obstetrical hospitals. The funds are quite large, all maintained by government donations and high bachelor taxes. In addition, the nurseries also take Italian children living in the outskirts to the coast for summer vacation so that they do not forget their lovely motherland, truly doing everything possible to be thorough.</p>
<p>Question: What about in Britain?</p>
<p>Bu Bu: The intellectual class believes that in the current world, even if many children are raised, there is no hope for them to become rich and live a more prosperous life than themselves. Rather than doing that, it is better to raise one child and raise him healthily. Therefore, even if there is encouragement, the population does not multiply. Hedonism and the pain of unemployment are already too profound.</p>
<p>German Protective Garrison System</p>
<p>I: Because there are too many women in France, they cannot marry without a dowry, so parents save money for their daughters' marriage, and daughters from poor families save money through their own work to prepare for marriage. Because there are many children in France, property must be divided equally, so people are unwilling to raise children. Therefore, the French civil law must be changed.</p>
<p>Kouchi: Germany also largely adopts the same population policy as Italy, with a marriage loan system. If five children are raised, it does not have to be repaid. I went to visit the famous "Mother's Paradise." Mothers who are liberated from household chores sleep comfortably during their midday nap in a comfortable style established in a scenic place, or do sports as if returning to their childhood years. Constantly doing endless housework, housewives feel great fatigue in their nerves and bodies. This kind of recuperation is really needed. During their time away from home, the housework and childcare are taken care of by members of the women's organization without worry.</p>
<p>Question: What is the work of this women's organization like?</p>
<p>Beruga: The women's organization is really doing a lot of work. Daycare centers are run by women's groups, and in the markets, women's groups also have special rooms, teaching cooking methods and serving as consultants for family troubles. The child protection department is always ready to help families in need. One is the organization of the Baojia system, with sixty-five families as a group and ten groups as a unit. A leader is placed here. The leader visits the families in the group at any time, inspects the family's situation, and sees which family needs help. The biggest service is at the train station, taking care of refugees fleeing from the war zone. The female youth group rotates day and night for twenty-four hours of service.</p>
<p>Soviet Divorce and Marriage</p>
<p>Question: What is the population problem in the Soviet Union like?</p>
<p>Ogata: In the past, marriage and divorce in the Soviet Union were very easy. One could file for divorce by paying five rubles, and even abortion was allowed. This provision, drafted from the standpoint of liberating women, was abused by many, so the authorities revised it in 1936. Now, they have changed and are encouraging childbirth, and divorce has become difficult.</p>
<p>Question: Finally, let's change the topic. In the enemy's British and American air defense systems, are they, like Japan, centered on housewives in the Baojia system, each guarding their own home?</p>
<p>Bu Bu: As I said just now, the air defense monitors and anti-aircraft gunners in Britain are all women, and air defense units are also formed in the homes, with responsible persons. Each family has one person sitting by the window every night, watching and reporting immediately when incendiary bombs are dropped.</p>
<p>Kondo: The United States has organizations of civilian defense groups all over the country. This is a government agency, with the First Lady serving as an advisor. Women participate in the air defense monitoring team. There was a time when it was criticized as a toy for idle-class wives, which forced Mrs. Roosevelt to withdraw. After reorganization, it is now headed by Landis, the former president of Harvard University. Women also serve in important departments. But they always cannot get rid of the American-style chaotic temperament. It is questionable how much activity they can actually do in actual combat. Due to the lack of materials and other circumstances, the general public seems to deeply feel the need for unity and hard work, so they should not be underestimated.
