<h3 id="c1">改善及提高國民文化 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本報運日論述參戰建國之道，從政治，外交，經濟諸端，而以富民强國爲立論的中心，作懇摯的進言，以期引起國人之注意與當局的採擇。但欲圖民富國强，尙有待於一般國民文化生活之改善與提高。</p>
<p>我國文化開發最早，文物燦然，有史可稽；但自漢唐以後，漸見停滯。其主要原因：由於士大夫尙空談，或專重文學的研究，或醉心於性理之微奧。而且，不是偏執一隅之見，與現實社會完全隔絕，便是抱殘守闕，多作門戶宗派之爭，只知對人，不知對物，更不知對事。至於天下大勢，國家經濟以及民間疾苦，更鮮關心研究者，且一般人民，則被拒於「民可使由之，不可使知之」的文化閉關之外。於是流弊所極，政尙虛僞，人盡空疏，國弱民貧。自倡新敎育以來，淺學之士，對於古代文化，多加鄙棄，游騖於歐風美雨，而不知實事求是，因之敎育之量高成績，只能敎人謀職求生。更因千百年來，習於虛偽空疏，所重者宗派與資格，所求者應酬與敷衍，對於近代文化的科學精神，徒拾唾餘，炫其皮毛，實際上眞有切實研究的，正是鳳毛麟角。所以有人說：「新敎育辦了幾十年，結果完全失敗」。可是單靠中國舊的民族精神，或所謂「固有道德」，要想在未來新世界中立足，是絕對不能勝任的。所以我們高喊復興文化，並進而提出「改善及提高國民文化」的意見。</p>
<p>爲了改善及提高國民文化，我們主張今後的敎育，（當然不以學校敎育爲限），一方面要充分保持歷史國有的人格　冶，道德修養，以求東亞的道義精神，或所謂東方民族文化的發揚光大；一方面更必須切實提倡科學敎育，從根本做起，糾正過去枝枝節節的辦法，從兒童敎育開始，即努力灌輸科學思想，使一般靑年不僅要立志做好人，而且知道如何做好事，不僅要立志做好國民，而目知道如何實踐。我們從中國歷史的研究中，敢以斷言：以中國人之天才，必然會產生許多科學家和事業家，建設新國家，與友邦共同保衛大東亞。其次，我國自宋以後，由於憂患相尋，朝中無人，不僅文化停滯，而且國民體力也逐漸衰退，朝廷有苟安之心，國民無遠大之志。我們今後要立國於新時代，爲東亞的衛士之一，就應及早培義多數健康，耐勞勇敢，奮發的靑年，一掃悲觀失望之情緒，及消沉萎靡的習氣，重振我中華民族的壯志，始不愧爲新時代中大東亚的兒女。德國在第一次大戰失敗後，全國小學一致提倡體育，矯正學生不健全的體格；日本國民自幼即受嚴格的軍國民敎育，數十年來，國民健康日有發展，身材也轉趨高大，今日一則無敵於歐陸，一則雄飛於東亞，絕不是偶然的事。我國民若長此以衰弱的身體，委頓的精神，臨此生活競爭日益緊張的世界，不僅愧言參戰，而目顧前途，亦有危險不堪設想者。甚望今後我國家經濟能日漸改善，人民生活能獲得保障，更於國家敎育，於培養人格提倡科學之外，努力於母敎及其他方面之研究，以改善國民體格，以養成「鐵肩担道義」的精神與體魄。</p>
<p>改善與提高國民文化，爲今日參戰及今後建國的最有力的保障，也是富民强國的基本任務，極願國人共同努力，求其實現。而且最主要的是必須普遍，使大多數人民均受文化敎育之利，而不限於少數特殊階級之子弟。</p>

<h3 id="c2">急轉直下的德蘇戰局 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>德軍以哈里果夫爲中心的新作戰，正在着着成功中。自斯達林格勒的悲劇以來，相繼放棄羅斯托夫，撤退伏洛希洛夫，哈里果夫，庫斯克等要衝，紅軍部隊追隨於德軍之後，張着「給與敵人更大的打擊」的標語，一步步向西進迫。但現在看來，這不過是適逢其會而已。因爲德軍的後退，乃是出於戰略的要求。一度放棄位於罗斯托夫，哈里果夫兩都市之間的頓巴斯工業地帶之德軍，驟然在此方面發動猛烈的反攻。其目標首先在奪還哈里果夫，紅軍所佈置之堅固防禦陣地，相繼被穗軍突破，隨地與以很大的損害，二月末，羅查伐耶，克拉瑪脫斯加耶，克拉斯諾阿爾美斯克等軍要據點，業已被德軍佔領，終於突入哈里果夫市內，在十二日占領其市中心部。</p>
<p>紅軍在南部戰綫的企圖，原擬從德軍手中奪還自頓巴斯至哈里果夫的蘇聯最重要的工業地帶，將德軍勢力逐至特尼愛布羅河以西，占領其發動反攻的基礎。此方面的德軍，若果然被逐至該河以西，則德軍自克里米至高加索的諸基地，也很危險。因而等待至春暖再行發動反攻，也將非常困難。然而紅軍的這一企圖，並未如願以償。自哈里果夫至伊齊姆的唐納資河上流的戰事，今尙在繼續中，戰局的推移，殊不容輕易加以預斷。此方面德軍的勢力，據外電所傳，總數有二十五個師團，其中有十二個師團係新從西綫開到的精銳。此與去年以來的屢經激戰與窮追而疲勢的紅軍比較起來，德軍方面顯然具有更旺盛的戰鬬力。</p>
<p>至於北部，中部戰綫的德軍，業已放棄莫斯科西方的庫捷茨克及維亚慈瑪。假使德軍的目標在於奪取布爾雪維克的老窠莫斯科，則此綫的確保或許是必要的，但德軍並不亟亟於此。德軍業已聲明本年的作戰目標，在於摧毀紅軍的戰鬬力。因而此方面的後退，亦可視爲係根據全面作戰的要求。歐俄的冬季尙沒有過去，從氣候之點看來，德軍依然被纏繞着不利的條件。雖然如此，但德軍的再度反攻，却已經獲得可　的成果。在南部戰綫，德軍占有完全的主動地位，克里米的防禦，絲毫沒有不安的徵象，北高加索的庫彭河下游地帶，與友軍英雄奮鬬，以抗紅軍猛烈的反攻。此在穗軍方面看來，乃是前途明朗化的有力現實。</p>
<p>袋近德軍首腦部所表明的慎重堅實之準備，尤不能不加以注視。從來德軍所採用質量的戰爭手段，今則轉變爲同時確保質量二者，以粉碎紅軍龐大的數量。沿波羅的海的三個國家及巴爾幹占領地，亦從事增强預備軍，擴充生產力，毅然實施人的大動員，但國民對戰局前途尙不許樂觀。戈培爾宣傳部長曾訓國民「與其對敵的戰力給與過小的評價，不如與以過大的評價始爲賢明」。由此可以看出眞正的決意。這決意如何反映於戰綫，將於今後的事實覘之。（翔：譯自三月十五　西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c23">東條首相訪問南京 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>內閣總理大臣兼陸軍大臣東條大將，於十三日訪問南京，親自與在主席以下國民政府首腦部懇談，並視察派駐當地各機關，於十五日回國。首相在戰時下的出使海外，不僅爲値得大臀的特例，依日華關係的現狀看來，首相　此次訪問中國，具有極　大的意義，對比成果，我們實寄與很大的期望。</p>
<p>日華關係，自中國參戰之後，同生共死，由於完遂大東亞戰爭之堅決的共同意向，而結成眞正的一體。日本對華新政策的基調之一，爲恢復中國的自主獨立，其進展實有賴於依照近衛聲明以來，不變的根本精神。交還租界，撤廢治外法權，新敵產的移交國府管理等，以及其他各種新施策，正係依據這根本精神而、一實施的，而中國政府方面亦瞭解日木的誠意，互相合作，以擊滅英美。</p>
<p>東條首相在十五日返抵福岡之際，日本更聲稱爲適應今後日華關係的發展，對於原有諸約定，亦決意根據上述旨趣，加以新的考慮。日本對中國的政策，以共通於兩國民衆間之東亞的自覺爲基調，建立同志的結合。首相訪問中國之後，無疑的中國上下對此將更有澈底的瞭解。同時，日華一體關係的屹然確立，向中外闡明之後，重慶政權的抗戰名義，愈將失其依據了。（翔：譯自三月十六日西部朝日新聞社評</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>東條首相在戰時國務繁忙之際，於十二日東京出發，訪問國民政府的首都南京，歸途經由上海，十五日返國。首相的這次訪華，如情報局發表所示，乃對汪主席去年底的訪日前往答禮，同時對國府的參戰表示敬意，並與現在站於大東亞戰爭共同戰綫上的國府首腦，謀溝通意見爲目的。</p>
<p>然而首相此行，竊以爲更有重大的意義在。第一，以首相的身分出使外國之例，以前雖有伊藤首相的訪問臺灣，廈門；西園寺首相的滿洲之行，然而於賭國運之決戰下，訪問站在同一戰錢上的盟邦首都，與其　首及以下之首腦者，作親睦誠懇之會談，這種事例，以前却未曾有過。由此當可把大東亞戰爭中，日本之確固的意思，傳達給盟邦中國，同時足以鼓舞執戈起立的盟邦士氣，其效果是很大的。</p>
<p>第二，近衛聲明以來的中日關係，以首相的訪華，一舉而吿完成，對於決定將來的中日關係，劃成了一個階段。按諸史實，明治以來日本的對華政策，雖有種種意見，然其一貫的方針，却是儼然存在的。其一就是日本的對華政策及行動，常基於日本的防衛而成立，此點與英美以及歐洲諸國之來此遼遠的東亞，祗爲積極的侵略政策及行動者，顯然不同。現在日本的對華政策特色之一，和其他歐美諸國逈異，像那奪取中國的土地而獨佔其經濟的權益，換句話說，就是瓜分中國，使中國次殖民地化或屬國化，這種企圖是沒有的，母寗是相反地，反對中國受歐美者流的呵斥成爲永久的睡獅，而希望中國不甘爲歐美的任使，成爲强大的國家，和日本携手，一塊兒保衛亞。近衛的聲明雖是發於中國事變之中，然其尊重中國的獨立，實也是這個歷史的日本對華政策傳統精神的發露。其後之日華基本條約亦然。中國參戰後日本之交還租界，撤廢治外法權，所謂對華政策的轉換，雖然是戰爭混亂時中之臨時措置的轉換，但在本質上決不是轉換，而也是歷史的一貫的日本之方針。近衛聲明以來日本之尊重中國自由獨立，以中國參戰爲契機，由日本的聲明與實踐而具體化，進入了劃期的階段，今後惟有賴日本的提撕以俟中國的自强自立而已。故東條首相在這個時候以首相的資格去訪問南京，其意義不能不說是非常重大的。</p>
<p>第三，首相在上海於其摳勞常地日本軍官民的致辭中，述及國策的轉換，對於第一綫上的國民，所及影響很大，或有使其陷於困苦立塲的傾向，也未可知。政府於同情之餘，並仰一體協力云云，然而　　這次的訪華之行，其希望在道樣重大的轉換期中之日本僑民，有以自重，希望他們應把難免發生的若干摩擦，克服於國策之前，此點，也有着不少的效果。（丁：譯自三月十七日讀賣報知社評）</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>東條首　於十三日訪問南京，十五日歸國。在首相的滯留中，簽訂了「交還在華日本專管和界的細目協定」。</p>
<p>政務鞅掌中的東條首相，此次親自訪問南京，係對去年末在主席訪問東京的答禮，同時，對國府的參戰表示敬意，並就共同完遂戰爭的方策，與國府首腦部，開誠佈公　懇談，順便視察諸派遣機關。首相滯留南京，上海的期問極爲短促，與在主席以决國府首腦部諸人會見，並與當地的軍官民會談，其目的是充分完成了的</p>
<p>十四日，首相在南京時，日華兩國委員所簽訂之關於交還租界的細目協定及附屬諒解事項，決定將正部在華日本租界在三月卅日　式交還於中國；各租界內的道路，橋樑等營造物無償移讓於中國，而國府則確認並尊重日本政府及其臣民在租界區域內所保有的不動產及其他各種權利利益。這協定簽訂之後，全　在華日本租界，將於國府還都紀念日的三月卅日交還於中國方面，在中國設租界以來，已經四十多年了。是日本人的大陸發展的橋樑，是僑華日人活躍的基礎，最近即將消滅，思之不禁興起無限的感慨。這租界的交還，是日本對華新政策的第一步，中國的獨立與主權將由此而完整，而日華關係將愈趨密切。又此舉將使當地僑華的日人從狹隘的活動舞台進人廣泛的活動舞地，故可稱爲發展的解消，僑華日人從大局着想，亦不能不同聲歡迎慶祝。</p>
<p>雖然這樣說，但以當地日本人的地位來看，租界是安居的樂園，也是第二的故鄕，因而租界交還之後或將感到多少不安，這說法也有相當的理由而値得予以同情的。即在政府當局，對此亦與我們有同樣感覺。東條首相從南京返京途中，也曾在福岡對人說：「特別對於僑華日人，想到其將因新方針的實施而遭遇許多複雜的困難，同情之念，油然而起。」並稱就今後的善後處置，將加以詳細的考慮。又國府當局亦曾聲稱：「接收之後，在運營管理上，務臻至善，對貴國僑民，特別愛護，並保障其福利。」所以切望僑華日人，應完全信賴日華二國政府，克服一切困難，在政府對華新政策的施行上，予以合作。</p>
<p>東條首相的訪問南京，與交還租界的細目之決定，不用說，同爲日華關係的緊密化與共同完遂戰爭上，具有非常的意義，但日本民衆不能存過奢的希望，以爲這些效果將立即實施。如首相的談話中所說，汪主席以决的國府首腦部，以及一般中國民衆，對於日本的誠意，自衷心發生共鳴，而持有同生共死的决意。但惑於依存英美的民衆，在今日的中國依然不少。於此，日本方面應斷然排除一切困難，澈底實施這新政策，以喚醒這種民衆的迷夢，努力加强國府。而在國府方面，應懇切諒解日本的誠意，以德報德，眞實地愛護僑華日人，同時，爲適應日本的新政策，應在各部門實行新的設施，把握治下的民心。（翔：譯自三月十六日東京每日新聞社評）</p>
<p>交還日本專管租界</p>
<p>在華日本專管租界的交還，根據旣定方針，一月以來，日華二國政府間幾經協商，其細目協定並附屬事項，業於十四日在南京簽字，預定於本月三十日見之實施。</p>
<p>這問題爲本年一月九日中國政府對英美宣戰之際所簽訂的日華協定之更進一步的確定，依據一貫不變的近衛聲明及日華基本條約，在日華提携途上，加上了新的動力。本協定所規定即將交還之日本專管租界有天津，漢口，蘇州，杭州，沙市，重慶，厦鬥及福州八處，都是根據日淸之戰後下關條約及其追加協定而委於日方之手，已有將近半世紀的歷史。日淸戰爭本可使東亞兩大國間有顯著接近的可能，但却不幸招致了歐美諸國輕侮清朝，促進其侵略中國的結果，這是不容否認的事實，因而歐美諸國使中國殖民地化的計劃曾一度完全成功，待第一次世界大戰終了，日英同盟滿期立即策動日華的離間，在華府會議中開出了撒廢對華不平等條約的空頭支票。</p>
<p>華府條約不僅是專門對付日本的苛酷束縛，在表面上看來，似乎爲中國打算的幾點，也決沒有眞正使其實現的誠意。即就撤廢治外法權與交還租界而言，直至二十餘年後的今日，日本首先發表實行之後，始作同樣的聲明，然而這也顯然是牽制日本的一種外交手段　已。現在日本即將實行的專管租界之交付，與此意義完全不同，證明了兩國的同生共死不是徒託空言。英美方面的手段仍是一貫的欺瞞，而日本才是誠意的披瀝。中國官民對於完遂大東亞戰爭，及在此途上日華兩國所取的共同立塲，希望由此而得到充分的諒解。</p>
<p>在華各國的專管租界，德蘇兩國交還已久，英美及其他敵性國亦在本年一月繼日小之後宣佈交還，義法兩友邦爲對日華兩國表示友好的態度，亦相繼倣行。中華民國的國家體面，因日方的英斷，而得以揚眉吐氣，實堪同慶。</p>
<p>然而治外法權的撤廢，須以中國具備法治國的實質為前提，而專管租界的交還，亦當然須尊重在華日人的權益，交易的安全，確保居住及移轉的自由。切望中國政府及民衆今後愈　其統一國家應有的自覺與自制。（翔：譯自三月十六日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>如何强化中儲券購買力，已成爲華中人民普遍的要求，蓋惟有中儲券購買力增强之後，一般物價始能低平，大衆生活始能安定，後方秩序始能維持，物資生產始能增加，最後勝利始有把握。</p>
<p>强化中儲券購買力之具體方策，論者言人人殊，惟有一基本原則不可忽略者，即大衆對中儲券之心理信仰，必須使之安定與鞏固。最近，陳市長在全國商業統制總會成立大會席上致辭，謂：「今自由貿易旣已改爲統制經濟，人民心理亦有糾正之必要。物價之高漲，推其原因，出於看高心理，希望統制別人，放仟自己，但己放任，何能統制他人，蓋經濟水準，高則均高，低則咸低，決無此高彼低，此低彼高之理。故人民必須革除過去看高之心理。」可謂旨哉斯言。</p>
<p>最近中儲設立參事會，其職務爲建議行務改進及關經濟金融政策事項。設該會能進而每月檢查中儲之發行，並公布於世，則民衆對於通貨膨脹之疑慮自可盡去，而中儲券之購買力今後自能多多强化，物價自能節節低平。</p>

<h3 id="c46">自制力 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>自制力，它是我們生命的力量，也就是我們生命之舵。</p>
<p>普希金說：「如果你能克服自己，你就能比你所夢想的更爲自由。」往往有人不能澈底了解「自由」的意義，反存有一種歪曲觀念，因而生活放縱，行爲不檢，這是非常危險的。當然「目由」是人類最寳貴的東西，但，要達到眞正的「自由」，並不是容易的事，自己必須要下一番堅毅的工夫，處處要鍛鍊自己約束自己，這樣遂漸的進展下去，自然會到達理想中的境界。</p>
<p>自制力對於人生有極大的功用，它能克制自己的私慾，惡念，夢想，貪婪……。有了雄厚的自制力，不論在生活方面，思想方回，行爲方面，不致越出正軌，趨向於奢靡放縱的地步。它能使人們憑着理智幹　，時時以良心來督促自己；它使人們有牢固的信仰，堅强的意志，去拒絕惡魔的挑撥與引誘。</p>
<p>太戈爾也說：「一個人做自己主人翁之權，是人權中最大者。」一個人應黨治理自己，鞭策自己；如生活紀律化，思想純正，檢討行爲，一些也不可以疏忽，常以理想中的人物作自己生活的榜樣，對照自己，這是最聰明的方法。假若一個人能充分地發揮出自制力來，就能做自己的主人翁，如此，不是已達到眞正的「自由」了麼？</p>
<h3 id="c47">評「一綫天」 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 尤靑</p>
<p>這是一齣大家庭崩潰與針對現實亂世「奇蹟」的悲劇。</p>
<p>劇本開始就描述家庭問的不融和：姑嫂間的明爭暗鬬，郞舅間的嫉忌，父子間的隔膜，使整個家庭無不處於哭，笑，叫，喊不安靜的狀態中，加以年靑一代的被迫害，極尖銳地刻劃出大家庭絕不容再存在了。這裏也能看到功利主義者的搖頭擺尾，「弱肉强食」地把人們當作塡脚石讓自己拚命向上爬，爬上了，就「一將功成萬骨枯」的一拳把人打倒；作社會苛待他的報復。</p>
<p>這劇木爲沈潔先生初入劇壇的「處女作」，在整個題材的獨特的意識上，是很努力而最不容易的。（過去對大家庭描述的藝術作品已很多，如巴金的「激流三部曲」，曹禺的「北京人」是）但本劇主題因人們現時處境的不同，很少能體味過來的。（大家庭！）另一方面劇作者並未把劇本依據着眞實性，必然性而加以可能發展的叙述，祗使停頓在原來地位上，（如慕蓮與澤民的戀愛只寫到了「羅亭」一樣而缺乏「前夜」的寫實）未給觀衆盡量的指示。再者還不够抓緊主題的中心、使觀衆無從淸析地理解。</p>
<p>這决演出的失敗，是「大悲劇」而無悲劇氣氛，是導演最大的缺點。在可能發洩悲哀的塲面，如澤民躱身望角見慕蓮與湯新華携手同出的時候：澤民的表情，幾無失戀者的處境。在笑聲過後絕無辛酸的回味，（劇本的限制也不無原因）絲毫不得把握觀衆的情感。另一面戲後演員（仍在臺上，而未作主要演出時候的演員）幾乎一無表情，呆若木雞地逕　直立在臺的叫周，尤其在第一第二幕中。</p>
<p>在演員方面，沙漠的梁慕蓮在典型的刻劃上是成功的，她表現了天眞活潑而又溫柔，惟國語欠正確。沈浩的塵珠極盡尖嘴與倔强，和立風的吳樸安演來都很好。高洋的家楣大體也不差，但臺詞太輕。潘彝的澤民不够老練，說話有鼻音。其他演員都很稱職。在效果上馬車聲與敎堂　鐘聲頗靈。提示太響。</p>
<p>此外，在編劇的枝節上：慕　與滙民離別時的戀戀不以催促而以楊新華的突然到來而衝散，這是脫　窠臼很好的一着。梁樹棠以醫學博士不做醫生而做囤藥的「西藥大王」，嚴肅而又切實，但不够明朗。</p>
<p>最後，除了導演手法的失敗，一般的說劇本的意識是够靈敏而實際的，故還値得一看。</p>

<p>「三個月以前，別人不知道，我是知道的，兵一來，逃到你們的地方，誰也不敢留他們，恐怕引起亂兵或盜匪的注意，你們却讓出屋子來，給他們住，誰也知道他們帶着很多的財物，都在轉他們的念頭，你們非但不碰他們一根毫毛，還用盡心力，保護他們。臨走，也不過給了你們二十元錢。現在你們遭了危難，賣田給他們，便如此刁惡！老實說，他們是不應該買你們的田的，你們的危難，他們是應該完全幫忙的！……」</p>
<p>阿五越說越奮激忘了他自己的地位。</p>
<p>「阿五謝謝你一片好心。但我們窮人，有什麼可爭的。…」</p>
<p>在大門口，根明再三向阿五道謝。</p>
<p>「還不算遲呢，你到家。恐怕我還不得睡呢！」阿五立在門口，高舉了燈籠，遙送着根明，只見根明，兩手緊抱了胸膛，走着，他那抖抖瑟瑟的背影，漸漸地沒入了黑暗中。從小靈山的頂上向南望下去，可以看見一條總綫，垂垂地到了山脚下，分成許多條支　，有　粗，有些細，有些密，有些鬆　通過了麥田，鄕村，接到崇文鎮上去。　是人造成的綫，正和螞蟻搬家時造成的綫一樣。綫在往由上拖，也像一張大網的網　，在向岸上拖：但這綫無　的長，拖不完，不像網繩一拖就完，繫着的網就會出現。一句話，有許多人正在續續不已地往山上跑。</p>
<p>這些人，當然是鄉下人，男女老幼，無所不有，都穿了他們最好的衣服，與高采烈地走着。雖然天上有陰雲，並沒有陽光，地上爲了隔夜下過雨，很有些泥濘雌行，他們都不以爲意。他們只知道今天是一年一度的佳節，三月半，「三月半，上靈山，」就是他們的口號，他們的決心，打破了一切的艱難，摧毀了一切的阻礙。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Improving and Elevating National Culture <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper, in its daily discussions of the path to nation-building through participation in the war, has sincerely offered advice from the perspectives of politics, diplomacy, and economics, with the enrichment of the people and the strengthening of the nation as the central tenets, hoping to attract the attention of the people and the adoption of the authorities. However, to achieve national prosperity and strength, we must also improve and elevate the cultural lives of the general populace.</p>
<p>Our nation's culture was developed earliest, with brilliant civilization and verifiable history. However, since the Han and Tang dynasties, it has gradually stagnated. The main reason for this is that the literati either indulge in empty talk, focus solely on literary research, or are obsessed with the subtle mysteries of human nature and principle. Moreover, they are either stubbornly clinging to a narrow view, completely isolated from real society, or clinging to outdated customs and engaging in endless disputes between sects and factions, knowing only people, not objects, and even less about things. As for the general trends of the world, the national economy, and the hardships of the people, few care to study them. Furthermore, the general population is excluded from the "the people may be made to follow it, they may not be made to understand it" cultural confinement. Consequently, the extremes of corruption prevail, people are empty and superficial, and the nation is weak and the people are poor. Since the advocacy of the new education, superficial scholars have often scorned ancient culture, indulging in European and American trends without knowing how to seek truth from facts. As a result, the high volume of education only teaches people how to seek employment and make a living. Moreover, due to the habit of hypocrisy and superficiality for thousands of years, what is valued are factions and qualifications, and what is sought is social interaction and perfunctory action. As for the scientific spirit of modern culture, they only pick up scraps, flaunting the superficial appearance, and in reality, those who truly engage in practical research are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, some people say, "The new education has been running for decades, and the result is a complete failure." However, relying solely on the old Chinese national spirit, or so-called "inherent morality," to gain a foothold in the future new world is absolutely impossible. Therefore, we loudly proclaim the revitalization of culture and further propose the idea of "improving and elevating national culture."</p>
<p>In order to improve and elevate national culture, we advocate that future education (certainly not limited to school education) should, on the one hand, fully maintain the historical national personality cultivation and moral character, in order to promote and enhance the Eastern Asian spirit of righteousness, or the so-called Eastern national cultural. On the other hand, we must earnestly promote science education, starting from the root, correcting the piecemeal methods of the past. Starting from children's education, we should strive to instill scientific thinking, so that young people not only aspire to be good people, but also know how to do good deeds; not only aspire to be good citizens, but also know how to practice it. From our research on Chinese history, we dare to assert that, with the genius of the Chinese people, many scientists and entrepreneurs will inevitably emerge to build a new country and jointly defend Greater East Asia with friendly nations. Secondly, since the Song Dynasty, due to successive troubles and the lack of capable people in the court, not only did culture stagnate, but also the physical strength of the people gradually declined. The court had a mind for temporary peace, and the people lacked lofty ambitions. If we want to establish ourselves in the new era and become one of the defenders of East Asia, we should cultivate a large number of healthy, hard-working, brave, and enterprising young people as early as possible, sweep away the mood of pessimism and despair, as well as the habits of decadence and lethargy, and revive the great aspirations of our Chinese nation, so as to be worthy of being children of Greater East Asia in the new era. After Germany's defeat in World War I, primary schools across the country unanimously promoted physical education to correct the unhealthy physique of students. The Japanese people have been subjected to strict militaristic education since childhood, and over the decades, the health of the people has developed daily, and their stature has also gradually become taller. Today, one is invincible in Europe, and the other soars in East Asia, which is by no means accidental. If our people continue to face this increasingly tense world of life competition with weak bodies and depressed spirits, not only will we be ashamed to speak of participating in the war, but also our future prospects will be fraught with unimaginable dangers. We sincerely hope that our national economy can gradually improve in the future, the people's lives can be guaranteed, and that in addition to national education, cultivating personality, and promoting science, we will also work hard on maternal education and other aspects of research, in order to improve the physical fitness of the people and cultivate the spirit and physique of "shouldering the responsibility of morality with iron shoulders."</p>
<p>Improving and elevating national culture is the most powerful guarantee for participating in the war today and building the nation in the future, and it is also the basic task of enriching the people and strengthening the nation. We sincerely hope that the people of the country will work together to achieve it. And most importantly, it must be universal, so that the majority of the people can benefit from cultural education, and not be limited to the children of a few special classes.</p>
<p>Translator's Note</p>
<h3 id="e2">Rapidly Deteriorating German-Soviet War Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The new operation of the German army centered on Kharkov is succeeding step by step. Since the tragedy of Stalingrad, the Red Army has successively abandoned Rostov, retreated from Voroshilovgrad, Kharkov, Kursk and other important strongholds, and followed behind the German army with the slogan "Give the enemy a bigger blow," gradually advancing westward. But now it seems that this is just a coincidence. Because the retreat of the German army was due to strategic requirements. The German army, which once abandoned the Donbas industrial area between Rostov and Kharkov, suddenly launched a fierce counterattack in this area. The goal was first to recapture Kharkov. The Red Army's solid defense positions were successively broken through by the German army, causing great damage everywhere. At the end of February, the military strongholds of Lozovaya, Kramatorskaya, and Krasnoarmeysk were already occupied by the German army, and finally broke into the city of Kharkov, occupying its city center on the 12th.</p>
<p>The Red Army's intention on the southern front was originally to recapture from the German army the most important industrial area of the Soviet Union from Donbas to Kharkov, drive the German forces west of the Dnieper River, and occupy the base for launching a counterattack. If the German army in this area were indeed driven west of the river, then the German bases from Crimea to the Caucasus would also be in danger. Therefore, it would be very difficult to wait until spring to launch a counterattack. However, the Red Army's plan did not come to fruition. The battle on the upper reaches of the Donets River from Kharkov to Izyum is still continuing, and the progress of the war cannot be easily predicted. According to foreign dispatches, the total strength of the German army in this area is 25 divisions, of which 12 divisions are elite troops newly arrived from the Western Front. Compared with the Red Army, which has been exhausted by repeated fierce battles and relentless pursuit since last year, the German army obviously has more vigorous combat power.</p>
<p>As for the German army on the northern and central fronts, it has already abandoned Kutetsk and Vyazma west of Moscow. If the German army's goal is to capture Moscow, the old nest of the Bolsheviks, then securing this line may be necessary, but the German army is not anxious about this. The German army has already stated that the goal of this year's operation is to destroy the Red Army's combat power. Therefore, the retreat in this area can also be regarded as being based on the requirements of the overall operation. The winter in Eastern Europe has not yet passed, and from the point of view of the climate, the German army is still plagued by unfavorable conditions. Even so, the German army's counterattack has already achieved considerable results. On the southern front, the German army occupies a completely active position, and there are no signs of unease in the defense of Crimea. In the lower reaches of the Kuban River in the North Caucasus, it is fighting heroically with friendly forces to resist the Red Army's fierce counterattack. From the perspective of the Soviet army, this is a powerful reality that brightens the future.</p>
<p>The prudent and solid preparations recently expressed by the German high command cannot but be noted. The German army has always adopted quantitative war methods, but now it is transforming into ensuring both quality and quantity at the same time, in order to crush the Red Army's massive numbers. The three countries along the Baltic Sea and the occupied territories in the Balkans are also engaged in strengthening reserve forces, expanding production capacity, and resolutely implementing large-scale human mobilization, but the people are not allowed to be optimistic about the future of the war. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels once instructed the people, "It is wiser to give the enemy too high an evaluation of their combat power than to give them too low an evaluation." From this, we can see the true determination. How this determination is reflected on the front line will be seen in the future. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News on March 15)</p>

<p>Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 10 p.m. on the 22nd that the Mixed Commission established under the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact has held meetings from time to time in the past. This time, it was decided to hold a meeting with a new lineup at the official residence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo on the 22nd. Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani, Italian Ambassador Indelli, Soviet Ambassador Stahmer, general members such as officials from various relevant departments of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and military members such as military attachés from the Japanese Army and Navy, Germany and Italy, put forward agreements on various important issues concerning the cooperation of Japan, Germany and Italy against the common enemy. The views of the three countries have completely converged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) The Japan-Germany-Italy Mixed Expert Committee held a meeting here yesterday. Relevant officials from each country fully exchanged views on various issues concerning the cooperation of Japan, Germany and Italy in building a new world order in which all nations get what they deserve, especially on various important issues concerning the cooperation of the three countries against the common enemies Britain and the United States. The meeting was filled with a friendly and sincere atmosphere of cooperation among the three countries from beginning to end. The views of the three countries have completely converged and great results have been achieved. The Japan-Germany-Italy Mixed Expert Committee was established in accordance with the Tripartite Pact signed by Japan, Germany and Italy in September of the 15th year of Showa (1940 in the Republican calendar). Since then, the committee has held meetings from time to time in Tokyo, Berlin or Rome, making great contributions to promoting cooperation among the three countries. However, this meeting was still held on the occasion of the arrival of the new German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, and in order to adapt to the current situation, so as to promote the close cooperative relationship among the three countries. Although Britain, the United States and other countries have held meetings many times, they have ultimately failed due to the ambiguity and inconsistency of their war aims or conflicts of interest, resulting in no effect from the meetings. However, the common war aims of Japan, Germany and Italy are extremely clear, grasping the common goal of building a new world order that guarantees permanent world peace and justice, and in order to achieve this goal, the three countries have always been in complete agreement on mutual cooperation, and have achieved brilliant war results and are steadily moving towards the realization of their common goal.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Japanese Newspaper Comments on the Recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 23 (Central News Agency) Today, the newspapers here all published articles discussing the significance of our country's recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing. The Asahi Shimbun commented that the implementation of the provisions for China's recovery of the Legation Quarter in Beijing was signed yesterday in Nanjing. The passion of the friendly Chinese people to strive for the liberation of their motherland will surely be further enhanced by the signing of the provisions. Moreover, the measure was appropriately decided at the time of the visit of the head of Bhamo, Myanmar, to our country, so it has special significance and is sufficient to prove our country's sincerity in fulfilling its promises as soon as possible. This has a profound and far-reaching psychological impact on the people of Myanmar, who are about to gain independence this year. Today, the spirit of cooperation between China and Japan is fully displayed in mutual trust. We firmly believe that our country's return of the Legation Quarter in Beijing will not only have a good impact on friendly China and Myanmar, but will also have a great impact on the aggregation of the total strength of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. The Mainichi Shimbun commented that Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights in China has enabled China to realize the integrity of sovereignty that it has sought for many years. Japan's purpose in the Sino-Japanese Incident is only to make China abandon its resistance to Japan and conspire with Japan to coexist and prosper, and to seek China's stability and prosperity. Therefore, Japan adopted the general principle of not demanding compensation or ceding land, and placed the policy of handling the Sino-Japanese Incident on the construction of a new East Asian order and the inseparable relationship between the two countries. The Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was concluded based on this general policy. After the National Government participated in the war, our country, based on the treaty, signed the detailed provisions for returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights with China, and has been gradually putting them into practice. All of this is a manifestation of Japan's great moral spirit. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing are indeed deeply shocked by this, and the slanderers of Japan have made their war aims even more meaningless. Moreover, it is not easy for Japan to take this measure, and there are also great sacrifices. However, it has now overcome all difficulties and is assisting friendly China in its development, which can be said to be a manifestation of Japan's great spirit towards the entire Greater East Asia. We firmly believe that the National Government will be guaranteed by Japan's spirit of "doing what it says" and will increase its courage. Its great movement for peace and prosperity in Asia will also be more strongly advanced as a result. At the same time, it will also use its total strength to defeat the nameless division of Yu Jiang.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Speaking at a banquet in honor of Ba Maw tonight, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said, in essence: "I have long expressed my respect for your courageous struggles against the shackles of British rule for many years. On December 8th of the year before last, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, and the Japanese army advanced with irresistible force, liberating Burma from British bondage and opening the path to the construction of a new Burma. During this time, I have deeply believed that the domination of the world by Britain and the United States will inevitably collapse, and that Japan's determination to build a new order is unwavering. I hereby reiterate my respect for your courage and insight. As we gather here tonight to converse with guests who have come from afar, the soldiers of the Japanese army continue to wage fierce battles to defeat Britain and the United States in the land, sea, and air across thousands of miles. This is sufficient proof that Japan is not only striving to carry out military operations, but has also begun to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly made false propaganda, in fact, under the protection of the valiant Japanese army, the Greater East Asia region, whether in terms of people, goods, or ideas, has begun to exchange freely and safely, so as to gradually complete the great task of building the Greater East Asia region. I am deeply convinced that during your current travels, you have gained a thorough understanding of this situation. Every time I think of the Burmese people standing on the front line of bombing raids as pioneers in building the Co-Prosperity Sphere and as defenders of Greater East Asia, without timidity and with even greater determination, united under wise leadership to build a new Burma, my courage is redoubled. At present, Japan's cooperation with its allied nations is becoming increasingly close, and the East and West are echoing each other, continuing to fight bravely towards the construction of a new world. Japan's determination to overcome any difficulties and thoroughly eliminate the root causes of disturbance to world peace is as solid as iron. I firmly believe that our war against Britain and the United States, based on justice, will undoubtedly be victorious. You are the wise leaders of the new Burma, and I deeply hope that you will understand Japan's unwavering determination and firmly believe in striving to build a better Asia and a better world, so as to fulfill the lofty responsibility for humanity."</p>

<h3 id="e17">Fierce Fighting Underway on Both Tunisian Borders; Axis Forces Defend Mareth Line <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce fighting continues in southern and central Tunisia. Our forces have counterattacked, and enemy forces have been repelled in several locations. German aircraft are assisting Axis forces elsewhere to firmly defend their positions and engage the enemy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - "The Swedish Daily News' London correspondent reports that it is rumored here that British operations on the Mareth Line last weekend were quite successful. The American Third Division bypassed the Axis forces' positions from the rear. British military commanders hope that there will be a decisive battle in Tunisia this week. As for whether General Rommel is prepared to defend this line, or whether he took advantage of the favorable weather conditions last week to withdraw the majority of his troops, it is impossible for outsiders to speculate. Perhaps the actions of the German forces will be known in a day or two."</p>
<p>Bern, 23rd (Central News Agency) - General Montgomery has begun to use the full strength of his army and air force to attack the Axis forces' defenses along the Mareth Line, ending the period of preparation and probing in the Tunisian theater and beginning a frontal assault. News from Berlin also states that the battle is a major one, and that there is fierce fighting along the eastern and western borders of Tunisia. All frontal attacks by British forces on the Mareth Line have been repelled by German and Italian forces. German forces are adopting a defensive posture in the south and central regions, while maintaining the initiative in the north, launching another attack on Sunday. Cairo admits that Axis forces have occupied the Nifsa train station, approximately two miles northwest of Gafsa. British forces have retreated, and fighting is ongoing. The British Eighth Army's attack is being carried out along the six-mile front between the Mediterranean Sea and the main coastal highway from Medenine to Mareth village. At the same time, the American Fifth Army is repeatedly attacking eastward towards Maknassy and El Guettar, hoping to join forces with the British desert troops east of Jebel Er Remili. Between the coast and the Matmata Mountains, infantry of the British Eighth Army, assisted by powerful tank units, are attacking Axis positions. Further inland to the west, light British units are attempting to outflank the Axis outposts of the Matmata Mountains from the southwest, which are currently hindering the British advance. There is fierce fighting in several areas of the front. According to German sources, light British units attempting to attack the flank of the Axis line from El Hamma have been repelled. In several areas, Axis forces are firmly defending their positions, while in other areas they have been ordered not to engage the Allied forces and to retreat to more advantageous positions in the rear.</p>
<p>Second Stage of War Now Fully Underway</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - The current fighting in Tunisia is extremely fierce. The Allied general offensive did not begin on the 21st; it was launched a week ago. At that time, British infantry had already advanced on the coastal section of the Mareth Line but failed to achieve their objectives. Montgomery then reorganized his troops. This offensive was not launched solely by the British Eighth Army; the American Fifth Army also coordinated its attack. At this time, on the 17th of this month, General Patton's troops also moved towards Gafsa, seemingly with the intention of drawing General Rommel into an attack. However, General Rommel did not fall for this ploy, and the first stage of the battle ended. The Allied forces then launched an offensive along the entire line, commencing the second stage of the battle on the 21st. The British Eighth Army launched a full-scale attack on the Mareth Line, fiercely assaulting the German-Italian joint forces' positions in the coastal area and between the Matmata Mountains. The mobile units of the British Eighth Army also attacked the flank of the Matmata Mountains. At the same time, General Patton also ordered the American Fifth Army to coordinate in the operation, advancing towards Maknassy and Gabes. The British First Army in northern Tunisia is still taking a defensive posture, but there is no doubt that it will also take action.</p>
<p>Bern, 22nd (Havas Agency) - In southern Tunisia, repeated attacks by the British Eighth Army on the Mareth Line have been repelled by German forces. General Rommel's forces are holding this line firmly. The North African Allied Forces Headquarters announced today that British forces launched an offensive along the Metouia to Mareth line, preceded by heavy bombing of the Mareth Line's defenses. However, the British side admits that the Eighth Army's offensive has encountered determined resistance from the enemy. The situation in the southern sector is not yet fully clear, but it is reported that the weather has been clear in recent days, the ground is dry, and armored vehicles can pass without hindrance. According to Berlin news, Axis forces have repelled the British forces. A communique issued from Rome states that Allied forces have launched fierce offensives in southern and central Tunisia, and fierce fighting is underway. According to both Allied and Axis sources, the American Fifth Army, north of the Mareth Line, launched an offensive simultaneously with the British Eighth Army, advancing towards Maknassy, apparently seeking to establish contact with the British forces east of Tébessa. According to Allied front-line news, American forces are attempting to advance along three routes: the first from the recently occupied Allied city of El Guettar, advancing southeast along the Gabes highway; the second along a small road; and the third attempting to advance towards the Mediterranean Sea. After occupying the Senad Station, American forces are currently advancing along the Senad River, advancing north along the highway to Maknassy. British and American air forces are concentrating their attacks on the Mareth Line. German and Italian aircraft are quite active on the front lines, bombing the ports of Bône and Bizerte, as well as shipping outside the port of Algiers. Italian aircraft sank a 10,000-ton merchant ship.</p>

<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that German forces west of Kursk, regardless of the difficult terrain, are vigorously counterattacking and making progress. Soviet forces are putting up stubborn resistance, but have been unable to stop the German advance. South of Lake Ladoga, Soviet forces again attempted to attack yesterday, leading to fierce fighting, but were ultimately defeated. Elsewhere on the Eastern Front, there are only localized battles. In January of this year, Soviet forces launched a major offensive from both the north and south simultaneously in the Orel region, attempting to cut off the connection between German forces in the region. However, due to the effective and unyielding response of the German forces, they were unsuccessful. As a result of eight weeks of intense fighting, 10,593 Soviet soldiers were captured, and over 15,000 enemy soldiers were killed. In addition, 1,061 tanks, 485 artillery pieces, and many other types of military equipment were lost.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Haitong Agency) - The west bank of the Donets River, from Chuguev to east of Belgorod, has been secured by German forces. The German offensive has now shifted to the Kursk region in order to coordinate with the fighting in the north. The roads in the war zone are becoming increasingly muddy, and Soviet resistance has also increased. However, the German advances southwest and northwest of Kursk have been quite successful. There is currently fierce fighting in the Sychevka region, and the enemy is gradually showing signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. The city itself is still in German hands. The Soviet command is transferring reinforcements to Kursk from the Mius Front and the central Donets, but they are being bombed by the German Air Force en route, resulting in the loss of a large number of vehicles. The Soviet offensive on the southern section of the Orel line has ceased, likely due to fear of encirclement. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces are continuing to put pressure on the German defenses west and southwest of Vyazma, but have not achieved any significant results. Fighting in the Ilmen Lake region over the weekend was limited to localized operations. A large-scale offensive launched by enemy forces in the Leningrad region was also unsuccessful.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to Nanjing <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>General Tojo, Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, visited Nanjing on the 13th to personally confer with the leaders of the National Government, including Chairman Wang Jingwei, and to inspect the local stationed agencies. He returned to Japan on the 15th. The Prime Minister's overseas visit during wartime is not only a noteworthy special case, but also, considering the current state of Japanese-Chinese relations, his visit to China carries extremely great significance. We have high expectations for its results.</p>
<p>Since China's participation in the war, Japanese-Chinese relations have been intertwined in life and death. A genuine unity has been formed through the resolute shared intention to complete the Greater East Asia War. One of the cornerstones of Japan's new policy toward China is to restore China's autonomy and independence. Progress in this regard relies on the unchanging fundamental spirit since the Konoe Statement. The return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, the transfer of enemy property to the National Government for management, and other new measures are being implemented based on this fundamental spirit. The Chinese government also understands Japan's sincerity and is cooperating to defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Upon Prime Minister Tojo's return to Fukuoka on the 15th, Japan further declared that, to adapt to the future development of Japanese-Chinese relations, it is determined to re-examine existing agreements in accordance with the aforementioned principles. Japan's policy toward China is based on the East Asian consciousness common to both peoples, establishing a bond of comradeship. After the Prime Minister's visit to China, there is no doubt that the Chinese people, from top to bottom, will have a more thorough understanding of this. At the same time, with the firm establishment of the integrated Japanese-Chinese relationship being clarified to both domestic and foreign audiences, the Chongqing regime's justification for resistance will increasingly lose its foundation. (Translated from the editorial of the Western Asahi Shimbun on March 16th)</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy wartime state affairs, departed from Tokyo on the 12th, visited Nanjing, the capital of the National Government, and returned to Japan via Shanghai on the 15th. As announced by the Information Bureau, the Prime Minister's visit to China was to reciprocate Chairman Wang's visit to Japan at the end of last year, to express respect for the National Government's participation in the war, and to communicate opinions with the National Government leaders who are now standing on the common front of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>However, I believe that this visit by the Prime Minister has even greater significance. First, although there have been previous instances of a Prime Minister visiting foreign territories, such as Prime Minister Ito's visits to Taiwan and Xiamen, and Prime Minister Saionji's trip to Manchuria, there has never been an instance of a Prime Minister visiting the capital of an allied nation standing on the same battle line, engaging in cordial and sincere talks with its head and other leaders under the gamble of the country's fortune in a decisive battle. From this, the firm intention of Japan in the Greater East Asia War can be conveyed to its ally China, and at the same time, it can greatly inspire the morale of the allied nation who took up arms, which is very effective.</p>
<p>Second, the Sino-Japanese relationship since the Konoe Statement has been completed in one fell swoop by the Prime Minister's visit to China, marking a milestone in determining the future Sino-Japanese relationship. According to historical facts, although there have been various opinions regarding Japan's policy toward China since the Meiji era, its consistent direction has remained firmly in place. One aspect of this is that Japan's policy and actions toward China have always been based on Japan's defense, which is clearly different from the aggressive policies and actions of Britain, the United States, and other European countries that have come to this distant East Asia. One of the characteristics of Japan's current policy toward China, which is distinctly different from other European and American countries, is that there is no attempt to seize Chinese territory and monopolize its economic interests, in other words, to carve up China and turn it into a semi-colony or dependency. On the contrary, Japan hopes that China will not be reduced to a permanently sleeping lion subjected to the scolding of European and American powers, but will instead become a powerful nation that refuses to be manipulated by Europe and America, and will join hands with Japan to protect Asia. The Konoe Statement, although issued during the Sino-Japanese Incident, also reflects this historical spirit of Japan's China policy, which respects China's independence. The subsequent Japan-China Basic Treaty is also the same. After China's participation in the war, Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality, the so-called transformation of its policy toward China, although a temporary measure during the chaos of war, is not a transformation in essence, but also in line with Japan's consistent historical direction. Since the Konoe Statement, Japan's respect for China's freedom and independence has been materialized through Japan's statements and actions, triggered by China's participation in the war, entering a landmark stage. In the future, it will only rely on Japan's guidance to await China's self-strengthening and self-reliance. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Nanjing at this time in his capacity as Prime Minister must be said to be of great significance.</p>
<p>Third, in his address to the Japanese military officers and civilians in Shanghai, Prime Minister Tojo mentioned the transformation of national policy, which had a great impact on the people on the front lines, and it is not known whether it may have put them in a difficult position. The government, out of sympathy, also appealed for unified cooperation. However, this visit to China hopes that the Japanese residents in such a major period of transformation will respect themselves and overcome the unavoidable frictions in the face of national policy, which also has a considerable effect. (Translated from the editorial of the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun on March 17th)</p>
<p>Part Three</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo visited Nanjing on the 13th and returned to Japan on the 15th. During the Prime Minister's stay, the "Detailed Agreement on the Return of Japanese Concessions in China" was signed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy political affairs, personally visited Nanjing this time as a return visit to Chairman Wang's visit to Tokyo at the end of last year. At the same time, he expressed respect for the National Government's participation in the war and held frank and candid talks with the leaders of the National Government on strategies for jointly completing the war, and took the opportunity to inspect various dispatched agencies. The Prime Minister's stay in Nanjing and Shanghai was extremely short. His purpose of meeting with Chairman Wang and other leaders of the National Government, and talking with local military officers and civilians was fully accomplished.</p>
<p>On the 14th, while the Prime Minister was in Nanjing, the detailed agreement and supplementary understandings on the return of concessions, signed by Japanese and Chinese committee members, stipulated that all Japanese concessions in China would be formally returned to China on March 30th; the roads, bridges, and other structures within each concession would be transferred to China without compensation; and the National Government would recognize and respect the real estate and other rights and interests held by the Japanese government and its citizens within the concession areas. After the signing of this agreement, all Japanese concessions in China will be returned to China on March 30th, the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. It has been more than forty years since concessions were established in China. It is the bridge for the development of Japanese people on the mainland, and the foundation for the activities of Japanese residents in China, which will soon disappear, and thinking about it cannot help but arouse infinite emotion. The return of these concessions is the first step in Japan's new policy toward China, and China's independence and sovereignty will be complete as a result, and Japanese-Chinese relations will become closer. Moreover, this move will allow local Japanese residents in China to enter a broad stage of activity from a narrow stage of activity, so it can be called a development dissolution. Japanese residents in China, considering the overall situation, cannot but welcome and celebrate together.</p>
<p>Although this is said, from the perspective of the local Japanese residents, the concessions are a paradise for settlement and also a second hometown. Therefore, there is considerable reason and sympathy for the statement that they may feel somewhat uneasy after the return of the concessions. The government authorities also feel the same way about this as we do. On his way back to Tokyo from Nanjing, Prime Minister Tojo also said in Fukuoka: "Especially for the Japanese residents in China, thinking about the many complex difficulties they will encounter due to the implementation of the new policy, a sense of sympathy arises spontaneously." He also said that detailed consideration will be given to future follow-up arrangements. The National Government authorities have also stated: "After the takeover, we will strive for excellence in operation and management, especially cherish the expatriate residents of your country, and protect their welfare." Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Japanese residents in China will fully trust the governments of Japan and China, overcome all difficulties, and cooperate in the implementation of the government's new policy toward China.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Nanjing and the decision on the details of the return of concessions are, needless to say, of extraordinary significance for the closer Japanese-Chinese relations and the joint completion of the war. However, the Japanese people should not have excessive expectations, thinking that these effects will be implemented immediately. As mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech, Chairman Wang Jingwei and other leaders of the National Government, as well as the general Chinese people, sincerely resonate with Japan's sincerity and hold the determination to live and die together. However, there are still many people in China who are confused by their dependence on Britain and the United States. In this regard, the Japanese side should resolutely eliminate all difficulties, thoroughly implement this new policy, to awaken the illusions of these people, and strive to strengthen the National Government. On the side of the National Government, they should sincerely understand Japan's sincerity, repay kindness with kindness, truly cherish the Japanese residents in China, and at the same time, in order to adapt to Japan's new policy, implement new facilities in various departments and grasp the hearts of the people under their rule. (Translated from the editorial of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on March 16th)</p>
<p>Return of Japanese Concessions</p>
<p>Regarding the return of Japanese concessions in China, based on established policy, the Japanese and Chinese governments have held several consultations since January, and the detailed agreement and supplementary matters were signed in Nanjing on the 14th, scheduled to be implemented on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>This issue is a further confirmation of the Japan-China agreement signed when the Chinese government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, adding new momentum to the Japan-China cooperation path based on the consistent Konoe Statement and the Japan-China Basic Treaty. The Japanese concessions stipulated to be returned in this agreement include Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shashi, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, which were entrusted to Japan based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War and its additional agreements, and have a history of nearly half a century. The Sino-Japanese War could have brought about a significant rapprochement between the two major powers of East Asia, but unfortunately, it led to the European and American countries' contempt for the Qing Dynasty, promoting their aggression against China, which is an undeniable fact. As a result, the plan of European and American countries to colonize China was once completely successful. After the end of the First World War, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance expired, and they immediately instigated the alienation of Japan and China, and issued empty checks for the abolition of unequal treaties with China at the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>The Washington Treaty was not only a harsh constraint specifically aimed at Japan, but also, on the surface, the few points that seemed to be for China's sake had no real sincerity to make them happen. Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, only after Japan took the lead in implementing them more than twenty years later did they make the same statement. However, this is also obviously a diplomatic means to contain Japan. The delivery of Japanese concessions that Japan is about to implement is completely different in meaning, proving that the two countries' life and death together is not just empty talk. The means of the British and American sides are still consistently deceitful, while Japan is a sincere disclosure. It is hoped that the Chinese officials and people will fully understand the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the common stance taken by Japan and China on this path.</p>
<p>The concessions of various countries in China have been returned by Germany and the Soviet Union for a long time. Britain, the United States, and other enemy countries also announced their return in January of this year, following Japan. The friendly nations of Italy and France, in order to express their friendly attitude towards Japan and China, also followed suit one after another. The national face of the Republic of China can be proud because of the resolute decision of the Japanese side, which is truly cause for celebration.</p>
<p>However, the abolition of extraterritoriality must be premised on China having the substance of a rule-of-law country, and the return of concessions must also naturally respect the rights and interests of Japanese people in China, the safety of transactions, and ensure the freedom of residence and transfer. It is earnestly hoped that the Chinese government and people will further enhance their awareness and self-restraint as a unified nation. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on March 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">500 Tons of Cooking Oil, in the Process of Payment and Delivery; Rickshaw Pullers Given Extra Rice; Household Rice for the Seventh Period Sold in Western Shanghai Starting Today <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the per capita distribution of cooking oil in this city by the Public Works Department, the distribution of cooking oil has not yet been realized because the Public Works Department and the Japanese Embassy Office have not been able to prepare adequately for various procedures. According to Mr. Yang Heqing of the Shanghai Cooking Oil Wholesale Processing Office, he told a Datong News Agency reporter that in view of the urgent need for cooking oil by the citizens, the office has decided to sell cooking oil according to the previous method before the per capita distribution of cooking oil. Currently, 500 tons of cooking oil have been issued by the military distribution authorities, and the payment procedures have been completed. Half of the oil has been loaded and unloaded in Shanghai, and is currently being processed for delivery. It is expected that the distribution will begin around the end of the month. At that time, the office will also announce the method of selling this cooking oil.</p>
<p>Foreigners Awaiting Oil Certificates</p>
<p>The sugar purchase certificates for foreigners in this port were issued by the rice purchase certificate issuing offices in various districts during the past week, along with the bread certificates for April and May. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the food administration authorities have already printed the oil purchase certificates for foreigners, but they will not be issued in the near future. According to a per capita oil distribution for foreigners, because there is no sense of urgent need, its implementation period must wait at least until the method of Chinese people purchasing oil with oil purchase certificates is implemented once before it will begin.</p>
<p>Grain Department Pays Attention to Cooking Oil Supply</p>
<p>The supply of cooking oil in this city has been interrupted for more than a month, causing the black market price of cooking oil to rise even further. The Grain Department believes that cooking oil is also one of the main daily food items for the people, and is of great importance to the entire food supply. Therefore, it has specially prepared a survey form. In addition to investigating the production and sales of rapeseed, the raw material for oil production, it has recently investigated the factories and workshops that manufacture cooking oil in various places, ordering the local grain administration bureaus to report in detail for review and approval.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Receive Extra Rice</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers' Guild in this port was previously allocated extra rice by the Public Works Department Rice and Grain Office, six liters per person per month, with the selling price the same as household rice. It is heard that the second phase of the distribution application form has been issued, and the rickshaw owners are currently collecting it from the guild. The purchase period is set to begin on April 1st.</p>
<p>Household Rice in Western Shanghai: 2.4 Liters</p>
<p>The seventh period of household rice distribution in the Western Shanghai district, totaling 5,650 bags, has been processed for delivery by the first industry allocation association of the district public distribution office. It is scheduled to begin selling at 9:00 a.m. today (the 24th) in the first and second wards by 55 rice shops simultaneously. According to the regulations of the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau, each person can purchase 2.5 liters of rice with a ticket. However, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, the 5,650 bags of rice allocated this time have an average quantity of less than 1.25 shi (石) per bag due to broken bags and small bags. Therefore, at that time, each person can purchase 2.4 liters of whole rice with a ticket at the designated rice shop. The price is 6.05 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>False Household Registration, Fraudulent Collection of Rations</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Administration Bureau believes that the accuracy of household registration in each district is of great importance to the thoroughness of the per capita grain distribution in the city. In order to promote the fairness and completeness of grain distribution, it has repeatedly sent personnel to the Nanshi area to conduct spot checks on household registration in the district to prevent abuses. Since its implementation, it has been found that 30 households have falsely reported household registration and fraudulently collected rations, and there is solid evidence. After learning about this, the bureau will severely punish and deal with them separately in order to rectify grain administration and deter others from following suit.</p>
<p>Category A Sugar Merchants Should Fill Out Reports</p>
<p>The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has separately reviewed and decided on the Category A retail sugar stores. In accordance with the instructions of the Public Works Department, the Category A retail sugar stores are required to fill out a report form after collecting 100 sugar purchase certificates and submit it to the Public Works Department for review with the sugar purchase certificates attached to the report form. The report forms have been printed and are available for purchase from the office at 80 cents per sheet. Each Category A retail sugar store should purchase report forms according to the amount of sugar they sell and complete the reporting procedures.</p>

<p>Regarding the issuance period of municipal residence certificates, after the police headquarters extended the deadline to the end of this month and the various districts extended the deadline to the end of June this year, no further extension will be granted at that time. However, it has been found that those who apply for and receive certificates in the urban areas these days are extremely crowded. The Yimiao police station, with the deadline approaching, specially dispatched police officers to inform every household in its jurisdiction yesterday. Citizens who have not yet applied for and received residence certificates should not wait and see any longer. They must know that once the deadline is over, the issuance will be stopped and no extension will be granted. At the same time, it also ordered the personnel of various household registration offices to speed up the filling and issuance without delay.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Strengthening the Purchasing Power of Central Reserve Bonds <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>How to strengthen the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds has become a common demand of the people in Central China. Only after the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds is enhanced can general prices be low and stable, the lives of the masses be stable, the order of the rear can be maintained, the production of materials can be increased, and final victory can be assured.</p>
<p>There are various opinions on the specific strategies to strengthen the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds, but one basic principle cannot be ignored, that is, the psychological belief of the public in Central Reserve Bonds must be stabilized and consolidated. Recently, Mayor Chen said at the inaugural meeting of the National Commercial Control Association: "Now that free trade has been changed to a controlled economy, the psychology of the people also needs to be corrected. The rise in prices is due to the psychology of looking high, hoping to control others and indulge oneself, but how can one control others if one indulges oneself? The economic level is high for all or low for all, and there is no reason for this to be high and that to be low, or this to be low and that to be high. Therefore, the people must get rid of the past psychology of looking high." This can be said to be a brilliant statement.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Reserve Bank established a council of advisors, whose duties are to advise on the improvement of bank operations and on economic and financial policy matters. If the council can further check the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank on a monthly basis and announce it to the world, then the public's doubts about currency inflation can be eliminated, and the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bonds can be greatly strengthened in the future, and prices can be lowered steadily.</p>

Except for the Japanese side, which has entrusted the Japanese Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry to handle the matter in accordance with the following methods, all Chinese and foreign merchants' cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory registration, in addition to notifying the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to handle the matter, also notified those who hold cotton yarn and cotton cloth to follow the procedures. Registration must be completed from now until the end of this month (31st). The registration methods for cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese and foreign merchants' cotton yarn and cotton cloth registration is designated to be handled jointly by the Yarn Factory Federation, the Yarn Industry Association, the Cloth Industry Association, and the Dye Industry Association. (2) The registration date is from now until the end of this month (31st) at the latest. (3) The amount of registered inventory is based on the settlement number on March 20th. (4) All holders of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, regardless of whether they are members of the various trade associations, must apply for registration. (5) Registration forms can be obtained from the registration office, with a printing fee of 1 yuan in Central Reserve currency per sheet. (6) The registration office is located at the Edward Road Yarn and Cloth Exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Inventory Registration for Various Industries Ended Yesterday <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The registration of inventory by various merchants in this port to their respective associations ended yesterday (23rd). All registered inventory of various industries will not be allowed to be moved from today. It is found that the various industry associations began to handle the registration of members' inventory because they had received a notice from the authorities not long ago, so they assisted the authorities in controlling the movement of goods. Therefore, all merchants have received notifications from their associations to follow the regulations and register in order to facilitate the movement of goods.</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou Electric: The Mongolia-Central China Trade Conference is scheduled to be held in Shanghai for three days starting on the 25th of this month to review the Mongolia-Central China trade plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China. The Mongolia side will be attended by Chief Niyama of the Finance Section of the Embassy, Chief Nakano of the Trade Section, and Chief Kataoka of the Finance Section. The delegation is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 20th.</p>
<p>Regarding the Mongolia-Central China trade plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the Mongolia side's original proposal will be discussed and decided within the day. However, the main purpose of the original proposal is to supply Central China with raw materials such as Datong coal, medicines, and medicinal materials, while Central China transports in daily necessities such as flour, cotton cloth and processed products, woolen fabrics, tea, tobacco leather, soap, foreign candles, and sugar, as well as groceries. In the past, Mongolia often had to pay a considerable amount of money for trade between the two, so in the 32nd year, it is hoped that exports can be expanded, and the above-mentioned materials that depend on Central China can be smoothly imported, so as to correct the one-way trade as much as possible.

<p>Beijing, March 22 (Domei News Agency) — Economic circles of both China and Japan here believe that the return of the Beijing Legation Quarter to the Nanjing government will further strengthen China's economic construction. Before the war, British economic institutions within the Beijing Legation Quarter included Asiatic Petroleum Company, Mentougou Coal Mine Company, Beijing Electric Light Company, HSBC, and Mercantile Bank. American economic institutions included Citibank and American Transportation Company. However, these were all swept away after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Economic experts indicate that the return of the Beijing Legation Quarter can serve as a base for China's economic reconstruction. While the administrative power of the Legation Quarter Administrative Commission will soon be transferred to the National Government, the authority over taxation and all economic matters will continue to be handled by the Administrative Commission. Nevertheless, the issue of extraterritoriality has now been resolved.</p>

This course will include cooking, sewing, and handicrafts. Ueno believes that girls will be interested in these subjects, and the addition of this course in municipal schools will help young women with their future life skills.</p>
<p>Establishing a Kindergarten Exclusively for Girls</p>
<p>Ueno also revealed that the Municipal Council will establish a kindergarten exclusively for girls to prepare them for school life so they will not encounter difficulties when they enter formal elementary school in the future. The school hours for the municipal foreign girls' school are from 8:30 AM to 1:30 PM, while the boys' school hours are from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM. The former is located at 425 Haig Road, and the latter at 544 Seymour Road.</p>
<p>Male and Female Teachers Already Hired</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the status of the teachers, Ueno replied:</p>
<p>The Education Department of the Municipal Council has already hired 29 male teachers and 18 female teachers. The male teachers will teach advanced courses in the Municipal Council schools, while the girls' school will be staffed exclusively by female teachers.

<h3 id="e38">Shanghai Youth Brigade of the Youth Corps Held Pre-Inspection Yesterday <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>To commemorate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the Chinese Youth Corps held a general inspection in Nanjing. Representative teams from all provinces and cities across the country participated in the inspection. The Shanghai Special Municipality New National Movement Promotion Committee Branch specially selected two youth brigade teams to go to Nanjing. Yesterday, Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, personally attended the event to deliver instructions and present flags. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue for the inspection and flag-presentation ceremony of the Shanghai Special Municipality Youth Brigade of the Chinese Youth Corps was the central square of Zhaofeng Park. The review stand was set up on the park's marble platform, with a high-hanging portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center and two national flags on either side. In addition to Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue of the Municipal Government, Director Ye Xuesong, Director Lin Jiongan, Director Ling Xianwen of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Secretary-General Zhou Huarong of the Municipal Education Association were also present. Military police assisted Boy Scouts in maintaining order throughout the venue.</p>
<p>Inspection and Flag Presentation</p>
<p>The ceremony began punctually. The youth brigade, led by Jiang Yinseng, entered the venue in formation. The entire team of sixty members wore military uniforms. They marched along the route while the Boy Scout band played military music. The inspection and flag-presentation ceremony began amidst the melodious sounds of military music. Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, presided over the ceremony. After everyone sang the national anthem and performed the rituals, Mayor Chen presented the flag of the youth brigade to the team leader, Jiang Yinseng, who respectfully accepted it. The center of the flag featured a white sun in a blue sky over a field of red, the national flag, which was solemn and beautiful. Subsequently, an inspection was conducted. Mayor Chen, who also serves as the chairman, led everyone in inspecting the team for one round. The inspected youth brigade then performed a march-past and national exercises, walking around the venue for one round. All members of the observing youth corps saluted. Finally, the mayor delivered a speech filled with sincere encouragement. After singing the song of the Shanghai Youth Brigade of the Chinese Youth Corps, the event concluded with the recitation of the National Call.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's speech briefly stated: "Everyone, your performance here today is in preparation to participate in the national youth corps general inspection in Nanjing. Seeing your spirited demeanor, I am sincerely delighted and pleased. Now, I will try to explain the significance of this inspection. (1) Previously, there was no organization of the youth corps, or if there were similar organizations, they were quite rudimentary and lacked training. Only the Boy Scout organization was relatively complete. However, the Boy Scout organization was tied to schools and had nothing to do with society. Therefore, after the launch of the New National Movement, we began to promote work at the lower levels of society, striving to strengthen the Boy Scout organization for youth and actively train youth organizations, hoping to integrate the youth organizations into one, which is the reason for the New National Movement's organization of the youth corps. (2) The restoration of China cannot be achieved through empty talk. Countries around the world have had examples of declining and then being restored. Although our country faces difficult and complex situations with many problems, adversity builds a nation. As long as we use a new spirit to correct our shortcomings, strengthen our basic youth organizations, and actively implement the New Movement, unifying form and spirit, and take on the responsibility of restoring China, China will naturally be restored. Today, I personally witnessed your spirited demeanor and orderly formation, which is sufficient to represent our city in the capital. I am especially conveying this simple meaning to you. In the future, the heavy responsibility of the revival of China rests on your shoulders. I hope you will encourage each other and work hard for the country."</p>

<p>Japanese banks have recently seen an increase in Central Reserve Bank note deposits compared to the past. Japanese banks offer lower interest rates than Chinese banks, yet their deposits have still increased, partly because some Chinese people must deposit money in Japanese banks due to investing in Japanese commercial enterprises. Currently, military scrip still dominates deposits in Japanese banks, but the banks hope that the deposits of Central Reserve Bank notes can gradually increase in the future to strengthen the relationship between Chinese and Japanese banks.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war, the transport of inland tea to Shanghai has become difficult, leading to a gradual increase in local tea prices. Now that winter is passing and spring is coming, with Qingming Festival approaching, new tea will soon be available in Hangzhou. Local tea merchants have learned that the Hangzhou tea market is currently thriving due to favorable rainfall since the beginning of spring, and the harvest is expected to be abundant, with prices temporarily expected not to be high. Furthermore, the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has made it easier to transport inland goods to Shanghai. Therefore, some tea companies have sent representatives to Hangzhou to negotiate and place orders. It is expected that new tea will be available in Shanghai in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Public Concession's various district baojia authorities recently issued a notice to members of the Self-Defense Corps, explaining the measures to take in the event of an emergency and how to use the alarm equipment. When on duty, if Self-Defense Corps members encounter an emergency, they must immediately insert the alarm switch key they received when taking over the post into the keyhole of the switch box at the post and turn it to the left. The boundary bell in the entire district and the electric bells within the boundary will immediately sound. At the same time, the indicator lights in the military police team will also light up, and the alarm will sound. After opening the switch, Self-Defense Corps members must immediately remove the key and perform guard duties. Self-Defense Corps members must pay attention to the following points at all times: (1) Off-duty Self-Defense Corps members must hand over the electric bell key they are holding to the Self-Defense Corps member taking over the post. (2) The bell key should be hung on the Self-Defense Corps member's cross-body strap. (3) Self-Defense Corps members should stay close to the electric bell key box while on duty. (4) Self-Defense Corps members who lose the electric bell key will be severely punished. Furthermore, the Chengdu District Baojia Authority has ordered its subordinate bao to select large buildings, such as schools and factories, to establish air-raid shelters. When an air-raid alarm is issued, Self-Defense Corps members should immediately guide pedestrians into the shelters.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Self-Control <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>Self-control is the power of our life, which is also the rudder of our life.</p>
<p>Pushkin said: "If you can overcome yourself, you can be more free than you dreamed of." Often people cannot thoroughly understand the meaning of "freedom" and have a distorted concept, so they live licentiously and behave improperly, which is very dangerous. Of course, "freedom" is the most precious thing for human beings, but it is not easy to achieve true "freedom." You must make a firm effort to train yourself to restrain yourself everywhere, and as you gradually progress, you will naturally reach the ideal state.</p>
<p>Self-control has a great effect on life. It can restrain one's selfish desires, evil thoughts, dreams, greed... With strong self-control, whether in life, thought, or behavior, you will not deviate from the right track and tend to extravagance and licentiousness. It can enable people to do things rationally and constantly urge themselves with conscience; it enables people to have firm faith and strong will to reject the provocation and temptation of demons.</p>
<p>Tagore also said: "A person's right to be his own master is the greatest of human rights." A person should govern himself and spur himself on; such as living a disciplined life, having pure thoughts, and examining his behavior, which cannot be neglected at all. It is the smartest way to always take the ideal character as a model for your life and compare yourself to it. If a person can fully exert self-control, he can be his own master, so isn't he already achieving true "freedom"?</p>
<h3 id="e47">Review of "A Line of Sky" <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— You Qing</p>
<p>This is a tragedy about the collapse of a large family and the "miracle" aimed at the chaotic reality.</p>
<p>The script begins by describing the disharmony within the family: the open and secret struggles between sisters-in-law, the jealousy between brothers-in-law, and the estrangement between father and son, making the entire family live in a state of crying, laughing, shouting, and uneasy silence. In addition, the persecution of the younger generation sharply portrays that the large family can no longer exist. Here, you can also see the wagging tails of utilitarians, who "the strong eat the weak" and regard people as stepping stones to climb up desperately. Once they climb up, they knock people down with a punch of "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones are withered" to retaliate for society's mistreatment of him.</p>
<p>This play is Mr. Shen Jie's "debut" into the theater world. He has worked very hard and it is not easy in terms of the unique consciousness of the entire theme. (There have been many artistic works describing large families in the past, such as Ba Jin's "Torrent Trilogy" and Cao Yu's "Peking Man"). However, the theme of this play is rarely understood because of the different situations people are in now. (Large families!) On the other hand, the playwright did not develop the script based on reality and necessity, but only stopped at the original position (such as the love between Mu Lian and Zemin only wrote about "Rudin" and lacked the realism of "On the Eve") and did not give the audience as much guidance as possible. Furthermore, it is not enough to grasp the center of the theme, so that the audience cannot clearly understand it.</p>
<p>The failure of this performance is that it is a "grand tragedy" without a tragic atmosphere, which is the director's biggest shortcoming. In scenes where it is possible to vent sadness, such as when Zemin hides in Wangjiao and sees Mu Lian and Tang Xinhua holding hands and coming out: Zemin's expression hardly shows the situation of a person who has lost love. After the laughter, there is no sour aftertaste (the limitations of the script are not without reason), and the audience's emotions cannot be grasped at all. On the other hand, the actors (still on stage, but the actors who were not the main performers) almost had no expression and stood there stiffly, especially in the first and second acts.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the desert's Liang Mu Lian was successful in her typical portrayal, showing innocence, liveliness, and gentleness, but her Mandarin was not correct. Shen Hao's Chen Zhu was extremely sharp-tongued and stubborn, and Li Feng's Wu Pu'an both performed very well. Gao Yang's Jia Mei was generally not bad, but her lines were too light. Pan Yi's Zemin was not experienced enough, and his speech had a nasal tone. The other actors were all competent. In terms of effects, the sound of the carriage and the church bell were quite effective. The prompts were too loud.</p>
<p>In addition, in the plot of the screenplay: Mu Lian and Huimin's reluctance to part was not urged by Cui, but was scattered by the sudden arrival of Yang Xinhua, which is a good move to get rid of clichés. Liang Shutang, as a medical doctor, does not become a doctor but becomes a "Western medicine king" who hoards medicine, which is serious and practical, but not clear enough.</p>
<p>Finally, apart from the failure of the director's skills, generally speaking, the consciousness of the script is sensitive and practical enough, so it is still worth watching.</p>

<p>"Three months ago, others didn't know, but I knew that when the soldiers came and fled to your place, no one dared to keep them, fearing that it would attract the attention of rampaging soldiers or bandits. But you gave up your house for them to live in. Everyone knew that they were carrying a lot of wealth, and everyone was thinking about it. But you not only didn't touch a hair on their heads, but also did your best to protect them. When they left, they only gave you twenty yuan. Now you are in trouble and selling your fields to them, but they are so treacherous! To be honest, they shouldn't be buying your fields. They should be helping you completely through your difficulties!..."</p>
<p>The more Ah Wu spoke, the more excited he became, forgetting his own position.</p>
<p>"Ah Wu, thank you for your kindness. But what can we poor people fight for?..."</p>
<p>At the gate, Genming thanked Ah Wu again and again.</p>
<p>"It's not too late yet, you go home. I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep yet!" Ah Wu stood at the door, holding up the lantern high, watching Genming off. He saw Genming walking with his arms tightly wrapped around his chest. His trembling back gradually disappeared into the darkness. Looking south from the top of Xiaolingshan, you can see a main line hanging down to the foot of the mountain, dividing into many branches, some thick, some thin, some dense, and some loose, passing through wheat fields, villages, and connecting to Chongwen Town. It is a line made by people, just like the line made by ants when they move. The line is being dragged from above, like a mesh of a large net being dragged ashore: but this line is infinitely long and cannot be dragged to the end, unlike a net rope that is dragged to the end, and the net attached to it will appear. In a word, many people are constantly running up the mountain.</p>
<p>These people, of course, are villagers, men, women, old, and young, all wearing their best clothes, walking happily. Although there are dark clouds in the sky and no sunlight, the ground is a bit muddy because of the rain the night before, but they don't mind. They only know that today is the annual festival, the March 15th, "March 15th, go to Lingshan," which is their slogan, their determination, breaking through all difficulties and destroying all obstacles.</p>

<p>The eighth person: "Excuse me, friends, can you squeeze a bit? I'm really in a hurry--"</p>
<p>One foot has just stepped onto the pedal, while the other is still suspended in a T-shape: so--two arms spread out, gripping the handles by the door, and the head turns around:</p>

<p>So A and B seem to say, with utmost regret, in unison: "Old X, why be so polite? Thank you very much. Next time, it's definitely my treat. No grabbing!" They both point at their own noses with their index fingers.</p>
<p>A stops his restlessness, and the button he unfastened while fumbling in his pocket; B puts down his arm raised high, and solemnly puts the crumpled bills back into his waist.</p>
<p>All three people are smiling, two are knowing smiles, and one is an awkward bitter smile.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Clinics Provide Medical Treatment and Medicine: Fulfil the Obligation of Human Mutual Assistance <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(1) Recently, drug prices have soared, and patients find it difficult to afford them, while the number of organizations that have always provided medical treatment and medicine is decreasing. The Chinese Medicine Clinic at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Marlborough Road, No. 2, Shanghai, is now run by Dr. Chen Cunren. To serve the poor in society, it has specially added the provision of medical treatment and medicine. Dr. Chen Zhichao has been hired to be responsible for the work, and the generous benefactor of Xin'anzhai is responsible for the medical expenses. It is stipulated that medical consultations will be held from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day, and all medical and medicine costs will be waived, in order to fulfill the obligation of human mutual assistance.</p>
<p>(2) The China Pharmacy was founded by Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Xie Baosheng, and Mr. Wang Boyuan, with the aim of serving society. In order to promote free smallpox vaccination, they have specially entrusted 26 dozen smallpox vaccines, totaling 624 doses, to be forwarded by this office to various charitable organizations for use. This office will do so accordingly and express its gratitude.</p>

<p>The Buddhist Association of Shanghai and prominent Buddhists have established the Buddhist Infant Asylum. Preparations are nearing completion. Yesterday, a founders' meeting was held at Jing'an Temple. Mr. Sheng You'an was elected as the chairman of the board, and Mr. Li Haosheng was elected as the director of the asylum. The opening is scheduled to coincide with the Buddha's Birthday.</p>

<p>— Yong Yu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library has been established for twenty months, with over 60,000 children readers. It lends out 54,610 books each month and currently holds 20,038 volumes, all of which are beneficial children's reading materials. In addition to providing free reading at the library for children, it especially offers group borrowing. It daily sets up several circulation stations, equipped with two traveling vehicles that carry books daily and rotate to various roads for exhibitions, so that children in remote areas and wandering children all have the opportunity to read nearby. Currently, the library is raising funds and hopes that enlightened parents throughout the city will provide more assistance to expand the scope of the children's library throughout the city, and also hopes to urge children to borrow books.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: Yesterday at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a string of keys, a small knife, and a chain were found. The owner can come to this service center to claim them. Tang Junhou.</p>
