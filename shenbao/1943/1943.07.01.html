<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何接受友邦日本隆重的禮物</h3>
<p>中國不幸於百年前受英美的侵略，訂立了租界與治外法權等不平等條約，百年來，英美以租界爲據點，束縛我自由，剝奪我權益，受盡了不平等條約所給予的痛苦。迫至大東亞戰爭爆發，英美侵華勢力一掃而盡，今春友邦日本轉變對華新政策，即以交還租界與撤消治外法權爲新政策之具體表現，除將天津。漢口。蘇州。厦門，等地租界决第交還。茲者上海公共租界之準備交還，亦於昨日在首都正式簽的。</p>
<p>上海不僅爲中國的重要都市，亦爲東亞的重要商埠，向居中國之經濟。政治。文化重心地位。今友邦日本毅然準備以公共租界交還我國，使百年來剝奪自由的束縛一旦消失，不僅精神上從此輕鬆，而且過去憑藉租界的種種不合理現象，亦將從此調整，對於國家推行政治經濟文化施策，得以貫澈無阻。我們人民對於友邦日本這一份隆重的禮物，決非尋常的道謝所可表達衷心之感激者。</p>
<p>我們對此隆重禮物接受以後，並不是引爲欣慰而隨便支配了事的。我們要瞭解日本此次準備交還租界，是期望我們自主獨立，我們將如何振奮自勵而完成自主獨立的任務，以副友邦之期望，是今天政府與人民，尤其是上海市民所應切實反省與警惕的。</p>
<p>可是，大東亞共榮圈內各國，就目前事實而言，中國的國情最爲複雜，徒有地大物博人衆的外貌，而缺乏現代國家的經濟建設與政治進步的實質，所以，成爲共榮圈內最脆弱的一環。可從兩個事實證之：（一）物價最高，無論日本，即南洋各地，如泰國·越南·菲律賓·緬甸·馬來·巴城·香港·等等，物價高漲程度決不若中國，尤其是上海一地之驚人狀態。（二）大東亞戰爭後南洋各地秩序恢復，異常迅速，而經濟建設積極推進，極爲成功。回顧我國則反建設停滯，生產减少。此已充分證明中國現狀是大東亞共榮圈內最爲脆弱的一環。我們於交還租界聲中首應反省而希望中日常局共同注意此種事實的存在。</p>
<p>此次日本交還租界之舉，友邦人士頗多比擬日本在明治維新時代之收回租界與撤消治外法權。但這是友邦人士的謙遜之言，我們知道日本當明治維新時代，國勢日强，司法信譽建立，收回租界與撤消治外法權運動，完全經過全國朝野一番的奮鬥而獲得成功的。這次中國的收回租界與撤消治外法權，完全由於日本對華新政策轉變的結果，自動交還，並非由於我們國勢日强而獲得的成就。我們政府與人民於此也應深切反省，而莫存偉饒心理。</p>
<p>同時，我們應知日本對華新政策中，這兩件事祗是尊重我們國家自主獨立的開始，換句話說還是對我政治獨立的一種試騐。所以，我們接受以後，只有向努力做好的一條途徑邁進，充分表現我們獨立自主的能力。這也是我們應當反省而深加警惕者。</p>
<p>我們盼望友邦當局，不但以交還租界即爲新政策的實施，而更進一步必須協助中國完成獨立自主的步驟。一切現代國家應具備的政治體制，以及經濟建設計劃與實施步驟，均須有不客氣的指導。這是我們人民竭誠的願望。</p>
<p>關於交還上海公共租界一個重大問題，需要討論的地方很多，我們現就先決問題，略述管見：</p>
<p>（一）交回公共租界一事，們人民應瞭解其對於國家主權的重要性，一致自動協力。希望我政府在實施交回之日，同時成立上海市民意機構，其人選不必過多，而其資望信譽必須足以代表市民者爲唯一條件。</p>
<p>（二）現在公共租界各機關服務之公務人員，切不隨便更動，惟以適才適職爲主，更不可濫用新人；並以睢持過去各項優點爲目前過渡時期唯一的原則。</p>
<p>我們對於日本對華新政策的實踐，在在表明具體化，絕非徒託空言一點，在此中日關係更進一步好轉的今日，是最値得鄭重提出，以備自大東亞戰爭以後所懷疑於日本政策的國人考慮，我們的「友」與「敵」，必須認淸，才是今後中國復興之路。</p>
<p>最後，我們熱忱期待友邦法國當局應有同樣的精神，及早自動交還上海法租界，不讓日本專美於前，而成中法永恒之友好。</p>

<p>條款全文</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　外交部宣傳部於六同三十日下午三時發表共月公報如下：</p>
<p>茲根據本年一月九日間簽訂之關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權等協定第四條，爲實施收司上海公共租界，本日下午一時已由褚部長與谷大使在寗遠樓，簽訂關於實施收囘上海公共租界之條款及瞭解事項，其全文如左：</p>
<p>關於實施收囘上海公共租界之條款，</p>
<p>根據中華民國三十二年一月九日，即昭和十八年一月九日在南京簽字之中華民國日本間關於交還租界及撒廢治外法權等之協定第四條，爲實施收囘上海公共租界，下列簽字者議定條項如左：第一條　根據上海公共租界土地章程及其附則等而設之租界行政權，定於中華民國三十二年八月一日，即昭和十八年八月一日，由中華民國政府實施收囘。</p>
<p>第二條　屬於上海公共租界工部局之一切公共設施，資產及財產上之諸權利，應按照現狀，無價移讓於中華民國；又屬於工部局之一切負債，亦應由中華民國按照現狀繼承之。第三條　中華民國政府應依照現狀，尊重並確認日本國政府及臣民在上海公共租界及其越界築路等地所有關於不動產，及其他之權利益，並應對此取必要之措置。第四條　中華民國政府於根據上海公共租界土地章程及其附則等而設之行政權收囘實施後，在該地城內施政時，關於僑居該地城內之日本國臣民之居住營業及福祉等，最少應維持向來之程度。第五條　關於實施本條款之具體的事項，應由中日兩國當地地方官憲間議定之。本條款用中日爾國文字各繕一份，由下列簽字者簽字蓋印，雙方保存中日文各一份爲證。中華民國三十二年六月三十日，昭和十八年六月三十日於南京。大中華民國國民政府外交部部長褚民誼大日本帝國特命全權大使谷正之。　關於實施收同上海公共租界之瞭解事項：</p>
<p>（一）上海公共租界工部局所保管之關於公共租界行政之文書紀錄等，應與收囘租界同時移交於中華民國當她地方官憲。（二）根據條款第二條，所有公共設施資產暨財產上諸權利之移讓及食債之繼承，除去工部局監獄關係外，由工部局與中華民國當地地方官憲間辦理之。（三）根據條款第二條所應移讀之公共設施，包含附屬於該公共設施之一切固定設備，及爲管理維持用之器具材料等。（四）關於條款第三條之具體的事項，必要時由中日兩國當地地方官憲間協議之；又對於日本國臣民永租地之地租，於根據日本國在中華民國國內現今所有之治外法權而起之課稅問題，尚朱處理以前之期間內，維持現行之稅率。（五）中華民國政府於實施收囘根據上海公共租界土地章程及其附則等而設之行政權後，爲充作該地域內行政上所需經費起見，應就該地域內仍襲實施上海公共租昇工部局之租稅手續費等一切賦課之現行制度制，爲暫行措置。此時日本國政府於根據日本國在中華民國國內現今所有之治外法權而起之課稅問題，尙未處理以前之期間內，應訓令僑居該地城內之日本國臣民，向中華民國當地地方官憲完納此等賦課，作爲補助金等措置。（六）中華民國政府對於中華民國當地地方官憲所應接用之公共租界工部局職員及其他被雇傭者，應仍適用，關於其薪給休假退職金年金等之一切規定。將來如變更此等規定時，應依據尊重被雇傭者既得權之趣旨而處理之。中華民國卅二年六月卅日　昭和十八年六月卅日於甫京。　大中華民國國民政府外交部部長褚民誼　大日本帝國特命全權大使谷正之。</p>
<p>日方公報</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日情報局三十日下午三時發表，日政府頃根據於本年一月九日與中華民國國民政府結締之「關於交還租界撤廢治外法權之日本國與中華民國間協定」第四條，命日駐中國大使與中國外交部長協議關於由中華民國政府實施收囘上海公共租界行政權等宜，頃雙方意見已完全一致，於本日於南京舉行關於實施收囘上海公共租界行政權之協定及諒解事項之簽字儀式。</p>
<p>谷大使辭要旨</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　日駐中國大使谷正之氏今於收囘上海公共租界簽字典禮席上致詞略謂：中華民國政府於今年一月九日對英美宣戰後，中日兩國立即發表協力完遂戰爭之共同宣言。同時帝國亦決定交還在中國所有之租界及撤廢治外法權等特權，常一時兩國成立關於此事之協定後，中日關係於此乃入於劃時期之階段。迄今僅六個月光景，其間已於三月實施交還天津及其他各地之日本專管租界，及國府收同鼓浪嶼公共租界北平公使館區，至六月五日法國亦交還其於天津漢口廣州等地之專管租界。今復得與褚部長簽訂關於實施收囘上海公共租界行政權之協定及其了解事項。並將於八月一日即付諸實施，使租界問題得有最後解決，本大使尤感欣幸。如此帝國政府關明之各政策，已着着實現，此協定及了解事項之成立，亦爲其表現之一端。本大使期待，今後之上海公共租界能成爲中國復興與繁榮之一大基礎，更確信中國政府當局及中國民衆必能發揚此重大意義。</p>
<p>褚外長辭大意</p>
<p>南京卅日中央社電　國府褚外長於中日簽訂交還上海公共租界協定典禮時致辭，大意謂：本年一月九日，我國參戰後，貴國爲援助我國之自主發展，即與我國締結關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權之協定。本年三月卅日，貴國已交還全部在中國之專管租界，六月五日吾國又相繼接收天津·漢口·廣州之法國專管租界，今日在此得與閣下簽定關於實施收同上海公共租界之條款及了解事項，實不勝欣幸。溯上海公共租界自成立以來，英美以此爲侵略中國之最大據點，妨碍我國主權，阻碍我國發展，莫此爲甚。今日得簽訂收同上海公共租界之條款協定，八月一日實施。俟上海法租昇、天津義租界，實行交還後，我國多年之宿望完全實現，我全國朝野之感激，非可言宣。我國於收同之後，關於其營理及經營，當盡最善之努力，以增進中外人民之福祉。</p>
<p>汪院長談話</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　上海公共租界之交還協定簽字後，汪行政院長談話略謂：自本年一月九日友邦日本與我國訂立協定以來，首先交還天津，漢口等處專管租界，最近更於本日完成上海公共租界之交還。百年以來，上海公共租界爲英美侵略全義之根據地，在經濟方面肆其　取、在文化方面肆其麻醉，其結果使中國精神物質均陷於鴉片之深淵。今者，藉友邦日本之鼎力援助，使百年以來之陰霾一掃而空，吾人誠不勝其感謝。惟葉人之熱誠，決非感謝二字所能宣示。吾人必須深切反省，懔使命之重大，知負荷之不易，吾人必須鴆其熱誠，盡其能力，使上海公共租界更臻於安定與繁榮。吾人尤須使上海公共租界在精神物實兩方面。將英美百年以來所浸潰之流毒，洗滌凈盡。使此英美侵略主義之根據地一變而爲中國獨立自一主之門戶，大凍亞共榮之一紐帶，進而爲世界和平之交通要點，此則上海公共租界交還以後，有待於政府民衆之協力者正多，吾人當以邁往之精神，擔當一切，以償國父廢除不平等條約之遺志，不負友邦日本援助之盛意，以副全國民衆熱烈之期望。吾人並望其他關係各國追隨友邦日本之後，對於上海公共租界之交還，迅速予以做行，更以最善之努力，進而與法國洽商，務使上海法租界之交還最遲於本年八月一日以前得以實現。</p>
<p>東條首相談話</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日東條首相當茲中日兩國間簽訂關於國民政府實施收囘上海公共租界之協定及其了解事項之際發表談話，略謂中國之有租界，特以上海公共租界之設立，自鴉片戰爭後開其端。其後英美即利用此種租界，作爲於政治經濟及文化方面制覇中國之堅固據點，而積集龐大之權益，於此並極圖保全其存在，因而上海公共租界之存在，實爲中圃復興之一大障碍，亦可謂爲建設大東亞之贅　。此次經國民政府收同後，於名於實，均爲中華民國之經濟中樞大上海市之一部，於東亞之性格下，面目一新，而重新發展，以言今後該地所佔之重要性，其對國民政府力量之增强，及中國之復興，實至堪期待。日政府確信國民政府必可以不折不撓之決意，以担負重新建設一該地之重責。</p>
<p>谷大使談話</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　關於交還上海公共租界谷大使發表談話略謂：關於實施收囘上海公共租昇之中日協定及了解事項業已簽字完畢，帝國關於交還上海公共租界之行政權，並將於八月一日實施，本使對此至感欣快。囘憶上海自鴉片戰爭締結南京條約關放爲商埠後，英法等國相繼在滬設立租界，美國又該事實上設立租界於中國之內部，並以爲東亞之侵略據點。其以上海爲中心，爲掌握貿易之實力，在自己之租界內設置海關，並以該租界爲據點掌握實權，壟斷鐵路航運等交通權利。在西歷一八九八年要求淸政府承認揚子江一帶爲英國之勞力範圍，太平天國之亂，英美法採取同一步驟，予以對抗，不久旋因美國之提議，將英租界改爲各國管理之公共租界，因此上海在英美法殖民地的性格下，成爲中國自主發展之一大障碍。辛亥革命以來，中國革命志士爲收囘此種特殊地域，曾展閒壯烈之奮鬥，但英國常以剛柔並用之手段，引誘各國，阻止中國國民要求之實現，期以上海爲擾亂束亞之據點。然因大東亞戰爭爆發後，日軍獲得最後勝利，及本年一月中國對英美宣戰，在上海之英美權益乃根本肅清。此次收囘上海公共租界之行政權，實可謂畫龍點睛，完成中國國父孫總理歷來要求獨立自衣衫襤褸　理想，對解放東亞邁進，此誠不勝慶幸。今日本使簽訂交還公共租界行政權之協定，實乃日本對中國所約諾之言而見諸實施者。日本政府對所約諾者，必有實行之決意，於此可以明瞭，今後本使秉承政府之命對帝國與國民政府所約諾者逐步見諸實行，實爲本使之最大使命。</p>

<h3>德蘇兩軍展開　大規模攻防戰　庫班橋頭堡蘇取攻勢　南部德軍居主動地位</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　東綫德蘇兩軍之陣地攻奪戰，自二十八日以來，益呈活躍，舉凡載要衝略，殆均已展開大規模之攻防戰。中部戰綫，除庫班橋頭堡外，蘇軍採取攻勢，而南部戰綫，則德軍居主動地位。各綫戰况如次，一蘇軍自二十八日下午始，至二十九日，曾在莫斯科西北方之威里克爾基及斯塔拉亞魯薩兩地區，前後發動數次强烈之突擊作戰，又在斯摩稜斯克東甫之斯巴斯第米雅斯克地區，亦曾以雄厚之兵力，猛攻德軍陣地，當展開激戰，德軍當局，鑒及蘇軍曾於自該地區至基羅夫戰綫後方，集結大軍，故早已準備萬全。一南綫之德軍，二十九日拂曉，已在里西澹斯克，伊齊姆及斯姆伊各地區，發動攻勢，尤以伊齊姆南方德軍，乘蘇軍之虛攻，抵唐納資河東南强襲動搖之蘇軍陣地。一庫班橘頭堡，蘇軍已在庫爾伊姆斯克西南西北兩地區，再度展開攻勢，雙方經短時間之肉搏後，蘇軍悉被擊退。此外蘇軍更企圖於達曼半島西端，登陸終未成功，並損失登陸舟挺十一艘。</p>

<h3>英軍事家語論　論英美侵歐</h3>
<p>日內瓦二十九日中央社電　英國着名軍事評論家哈脫大尉，在「每日郵報」上發表論文，再度面其國人，陳述侵犯歐洲之種種危險。哈脫大尉稱，因循延誤準備不充足，其危險彼此正相等，英美宣傳已久之　　第二戰綫企圖，其所以遲遲不能實行者，正由於需要澈底準備之故。英國人　到最近，鑒於軸心防禦地位之堅固，方始明瞭需要寧備之程度，一般人亦已明了英美侵犯歐洲所遭遇之重大問題，英國人民　聞人云，此次戰爭中所需要者，厥爲攻勢，且英人鑒於一九四〇年德軍攻勢之成功，故此種幻想，更爲得勢，但攻勢並非爲惟一之需要，英美人必須知此一點，任何交戰國家，從未有如英美目下所有之長而艱困之前途，英美曾被此互相許諾，並向世界許諾，謂彼等之敵人。將無條件屈服，但鑒於軸心在歐洲所擁有之堅強地位，此項許諾，殊不易實踐，須知敵人目下，正在竭力使美之工作增加困難，甚至有隕越之虞，哈脫末稱，英美最佳之機會，在於發展防禦之「新工具與新方法」云。</p>

<h3>美罷工風潮蔓延　影響軍需工業極鉅　製造飛機坦克等之工廠宣告停頓　羅斯福曾與內長伊克斯會商辦法</h3>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　據華盛頓底特律電訊，一般人曾信，羅斯福總統，現準備將政府對國內工潮之見解，親自訴諸國人之前，但昨日仍有復工作，而密希根州之克雷斯勒公司，高地公園戰具工廠之逾半數工人，星期一晚間又未上夜班，因防止罷工法已於星期五日由國會通過，故高地公園戰具工廠之罷工，實開美國大規模工潮之新紀錄，該廠出產軍隊應用坦克車大砲飛機引擎及載重車等，均爲之宣告停頓。羅斯福總統昨日曾與內長伊克斯會商，美國人民現均切盼政府在嚴峻之防止罷工法下，採取行動，以強迫數千罷工礦工恢復工作，昨日阿拉巴馬州又有熔爐一處，因該州煤產驟减，及各鋼鐵公司所存燃料之逐漸告罄，業已停閉，該州二萬四千礦工中，目前照常工作者，祇三千餘人。坎特基州之六萬礦工，已全部復工，賓夕法尼亞州之礦工，亦有陸續復工者，惟其他地方，則尙有當選數怠工事件繼續發生，賓夕法尼亞州若干區域，仍有數千工人因要求增加工資，繼續僵持中。據最近美國各礦傳來消息，昨日仍有三萬九千名礦工，反抗政府與彼等領袖路易斯云。</p>
<h3>英美的食糧問題（一）</h3>
<p>美國</p>
<p>去年度美國農產物的生產額、比前年增加了百分之十四、超過一九三八年的百分之十二，而創造新紀錄。例如小麥自一九四一年的九億四千三百萬斛（量名·每斛容量八加侖）增至九億八千一百萬斛。玉蜀黍自二十六億七千二百萬斛增加至三十一億七千五百萬斛。肉類亦達二百十億磅的紀錄。據當局的估計，本年度可更增加。且據去年十一月農務長官維卡特氏所發表的本年度生產目標，除小麥外，其他各種的數字較去年大見增加，而維卡特且强調此爲最小限度的必要量。試舉其數字如次：</p>
<p>肉類二百五十億磅（此去年增十六％）鷄肉四十億磅（增二八％）玉蜀黍增四％，馬鈴薯增一〇％，牛乳干二百廿億磅）增二十億磅，小麥則自五千二百五十萬英畝中减少九十萬英畝。</p>
<p>就美國食糧生產的實際狀態來看，自去年下半年以後，漸趨惡化，繼卡特的本年度增產目標，能否依計劃實現。頗成疑問。美國全部農產物的四分之一，預約供給美國及反軸心軍隊之用。蘇聯並英國曾要求在本年度增加食糧輸出，尤以援蘇輸出的增加乃必然的狀態。一面國內的通貨膨脹也增進美國一般人民之食料品的需要。爲要對付這種國內外的要求，美國的糧食政策遂更見困難。因此，美國的農村，爲了遂行戰爭而負上了非常的負担。阻止增產的實現之實際原因，一爲勞慟力的不足，二爲農作機械的缺乏。三爲運輸的逼迫，四爲農產物價格比一般物價水準低廉。農村勞働力不足的主要原因，乃因被誘於軍儒工業的高工資而村工人陸續農離村，及因陸海軍徵兵的增加所致。自戰爭勃發，政府即完全禁止農作機械的製造，故現在其供給頗不充分，因此，食糧不足漸普遍於全國，一切食料品殆全已實施配給制。下院農村集團的議員們。爲要打開農村的這種窘狀，遂出以牽制羅斯福的農業政策之舉，動輒攻擊政府。羅斯福途屈服於農村議員的執拗攻勢之前，在本年三月，原由維卡特兼任的食糧局長官，由台維斯取代，以謀適應他們的希望，並採用各種的農業政策。其勞力對策首先把農村出身的士兵五十萬名暫令歸農，而本年度　徵的農村壯丁三百萬則暫緩召集，此外並決定從墨西哥移入勞働者五萬，迦麥加一萬，哈巴那二千。更動員學生、婦人從事短時期的勞働，組織「農業勞働義勇隊」，隊員數達四十萬之眾。就農作機械而言，戰時生產局決定把平時必要量三成的銅鐵類，配給於製造農作機械，用以溢足農村的要求。此外並擬將稱爲「勝利農園」的小農園普及於一般民間，目下正展開以創設一千八百萬個農　爲目標的大連動。</p>
<p>今年二月，維蔔特發表在都市開設」千二百萬，在農村開設六百萬，「勝利農園」的計劃，農務部傾其全力對這勝利農園從事肥料的配給，耕作上的指導。</p>
<p>要使農民熱心增產，不能不先提高農產物價格，這是美國農民的實情。政府方面對此的政策，始終反對僅給與生產補助金於各農塲以提高農產物價格。農村方面提高價格的要求，主張農產物與其他物價應保持均衡，承認平衡價格。對此，政府方面則着眼於防止美國一般生產費的昻騰，對農產物生產者除補償其生產費之一部以外，不擬容納農村的要求。農村議員們提高農產物價格法案，雖經上下二院過，但羅斯福加以拒絕，重付上院審議。政府對農村關係的齷齪，爲美國遂行戰爭上極大的障害。除政府農業政策的缺使預期的農產物的收穫，趨向悲觀。（譯自廿三日朝日新聞阿根廷京城電）</p>

<h3>交不公共租界協定簽訂　滬市極興奮　岡崎談任內施政情形</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訉）國民政府外交部於昨日在京與友邦日本簽訂交還上海公共租界之協定，本市各界莫不歡騰鲨躍，而對友邦之協力我國尤表欽敬，全國商業統制總會理事長唐　民，特發表談話云「上海特別市從今後成功真正之上海特別市，吾人應十萬分之努力，求得上海特別市爲吾國之模範市，以期不負素志，不負交還租界之友邦一番好意。」市　部主任委員凌　文亦發表談話云「本埠公共租界收囘已見諸事貿，殊見友邦對我尊重主權之精神，及其見義勇爲之美意，不特本黨同志表示感奮，即全國人民亦莫不稱謝。」</p>
<p>陳市長談話　南京卅日中央社電，關於收囘上海公共租界，陳上海市長昨發表談話云：「此次日本以援助中國獨立自由之精神，促成交囘上海公共租界之實現，日本不但首先交囘其專管之租界，其理想之遠大，友誼之深摯，魄力之宏毅，殊使　肩作戰於大東亞戰爭之中國人民，非常感　。</p>
<p>至於法租界問題，法租界之行政權一日不交囘，即上海市政仍然未能完整，亦即中國之行政權未能完整，本人深盼法國當局，體認此嚴重性，即於八月一日與公共租界同時交囘，此舉不但對於上海治安有極大之貢獻，且可履行法國之蹃　，增加中法之友誼，本人對於此點，深盼法國當局本於中法多日之交誼，爲深深之自覺者也。</p>
<p>公共租界與法租界同時收囘之後，上海之問題尙多，即區域之如何爲合理之調整，治安之如何爲效率之增加，建設之如何爲迅速之着手，應由上海市全體市民與市政府共同協力，則上海之繁榮與安寗，可拭目以俟。」陳市長同時復發表簽定收囘公共租界條款告團民一文，盼望全市民今後協力於建設新方向的大上海。</p>
<p>田尻公使談話</p>
<p>關於上海公共租界交還事田尻公使談話云上海公共租界行政權交還實施協定，業於六月卅日中日雙方簽約，上海公共租界自八月一日起，將由中國收囘，囘顧大東亞戰爭勃發之初，英美在華勢力即遭驅逐，大東亞地域之英美勢力均被覆滅排除，結果中日兩國得以歸於本然姿態，不再受宿敵英美之任何策動與妨害，携手共進完成目的，日本乃在此種基礎之上，決意實現中日兩國友好關係之劃時代的躍進，　於一月九日撤廢治外法權，關於交還租界等締結原則協定，以期首先貢獻中國之政治的獨立與完整，其後日本對於此種對華政策即積極推進，在華各地之日本租界固已交還，即廈門公共租界，北京公使館區域之交還等，亦逐漸實施，茲上海公共租界亦將於一個月後實施交還，上海公共租界起源於距今約百年前，因雅片戰爭結果，經南京條約規定爲英國人之居住地，其後與美租界合併爲公共租界，一世紀以來，爲英美侵略之最大據點，其行政權向由英美一手掌人專用居住地而開設之上海租界，實成爲侵害中國獨立主權之殖民地，助長中國內亂之據點，並爲離間中日兩國友好關係，使起鬥爭等一切陰謀策術之發源地，此種阻碍東亞民許與隆之重大障害，直保持至大東亞戰爭勃發後始予消滅，當時實因鑒於中國之實情及東亞之情勢，卒不得不在百年之長時期內甘伏於此屈辱歷史之下。因之上海公共租界之交還，實爲常時衷心希望中國興隆之帝國所當然，必須採取之措置，如由中國方面而觀，則可謂永年宿怨莫美在東亞之侵略策源地，即將永遠消滅，而多年宿望，亦得一旦達到，又對於採取此次措置，日本之真意不獨中國爲然，深信法蘭西義大利等有關之第三國家，亦均可充分予以諒解，天津之義租界及上海之法租界，如因法義之理解態度得於八月一日以前收囘則關於租界問題之中國主權，即得先成獨立，　可關係　　上劃時代之重大事件。　望中國人士對中日協力愈益　起，敬祝參戰中國之飛躍進　同時希望在華日人亦充分瞭　日本政府用意，　　政府施策，共同一致協力。</p>
<p>岡崎總董談話　工部局總董岡崎　　氏，當茲工部局即將交還之際，特就經營苦心發表談話如下：當大東亞戰爭勃發後，余奉命出任工部局之隙，當時却如單身深入敵陣，心境異悲壯，然當時總董李德爾（英人）及總辦費利浦（英人）均爲以往所素悉，故彼等雖爲敵性國人，然爲維持租界內安　起見，對於日方施策，仍多協力，因之事務進行意外輕易，余入工部局當時腦中所，</p>
<p>考慮事項　有五，（一）排除工部局內敵性（二）維持舊有能率，（三）確保治安，（四）安定民生，（五）健全財政。第一之排除敵性與第二維持能率有密切關係，同時欲解決二個問題，實極爲困難，當時工部局職員中，有敵性國人近三百人，其中大多憶服務二三十年，故如一律加以革職，則行政能率必將低下，因決採取漸進主義，俟日方獲得適當人材後，即行逐漸改變陣容；如此一年餘來，敵性　人方始全部去職，然工部局百年以來，受英美把持，英美色彩極爲濃厚，致工部局之組織機構，仍留有英美形式，又言語方面亦然，日本語在某種程度雖已見使用，然英語亦依然使用，變更英語路名及撤除英國人銅像問題，仍未解決，蓋亦爲維持能率而採取漸進主義之故，實非得已也。爲欲維持能率，曾採取慎重態度，故工部局自經日方接收後，直至今日，市行政之運用始終極爲圓滑，並無任何障碍，第三就</p>
<p>確保治安　而言，上海治安在去看三月以前，極爲不良，恐佈炸彈事件等，每日頻見發生，乃將工部局警察加以根本改組，同時着手非常困難之保甲組織工作，當初各方對保甲組織頗表反對，議論粉紜，或謂保甲組織決不可能，或謂使市民加重負担，寶不相宜等等，然結果卒破除此項反對論調而着手組織保甲，此種保甲制度，對於維持治安頗收成效，工部局保甲制度之特徵，乃在不使市民加重金錢上之負担，僅令提供勞力，因此本年度工部局預算特別列入保甲費一千萬元，其後市民對於保甲制度遂拋棄以往之袖手旁觀態度，紛紛予以認真協力，情形之良好，出乎意外，罪案頻發之上海於茲面目爲之一新，成爲明朗之上海，此因多賴日本陸海軍之努力，然保甲團之功績亦不容忽視，目下共有三十五萬以上之華人，担任自警　，第四爲解決民生安定問題起見，曾　全力於生活必需品之公平配給，及</p>
<p>物價抑制　上海向未奉辦戶籍一故最初一般咸稱欲實施憑票配給制度，實不可能，然其後米價日見猛騰，市民生活極受威　，當時遂感覺非實行憑票配給制度，實無辦法打　此項　關，卒經克服一切困難，首先調查戶口，於去年六月起實施米麵粉之憑票配給制，成績極爲良好，賴憑票制之實施，租界內之市民，不論何人，均得享受低價之米麵粉，而</p>
<p>憑票本給　制，今後對於火柴肥皂食油亦將採取同一步驟，業已完成凖備，其次之物價對　，因上海情形特殊，故並不採取公定價格制，而專　　取　　利，　　用盡一切手段，然　價之　　仍無法抑制，而　　敗，此　有種種原因，　保敗　之將，對於此　不願加以聲辦，唯有對　　力所不及之處表示歉意而已。最後就財敗問題而言，工部局過去十餘年來，連年收　無法平衛，然大東亞戰爭勃發後，市政公債之發行已不可能，且稅款亦有欠繳，故必須忍受重大犧牲，努力克服此項　額，工部局旣由日方接收，工部局之經費不足，即須由日方負担，因之爲　補缺額起見乃實施削减職員薪俸，節約經費，廢除不急事業等，同時並新蘭零售捐飲食捐等新稅源，幸市民均予協力，對於納稅義務亦盡力履行，故至去年底，缺額卒得以彌補，而實際反可盈餘。</p>
<p>本年預算　爲二億五千萬元，預料本年前途毫無足盧，當可繼續維持健全財政，本年度預算中捐稅收入一項，計列一億六千六百萬元，在六月以前，即已全數收足，此項財政之健全深信對於日本之完成大東亞戰爭當亦有多少貢獻。茲希望華方諒解日本之真意，辦求市行政之公正　滑推進，以期上海租界之收囘，對於中國之復興，確能有所貢獻，幸陳公博市長乃係行政專家，故對於此點，可以安心無憂。</p>
<h3>廣田報道課長對　東西兩戰塲沈寂之觀察</h3>
<p>（中央社本埠特訉）　日大使館　　課長廣田，昨在　這招待外報記者　會席上，發表談話謂：一般非專門的軍事評論，解釋南大平洋與歐洲戰塲軍事之靜寂，爲軸心各國力衰之晴示一節，此種以第一次世界大戰爲根據而判斷目前戰　之結果，實造成極嚴重之錯誤。</p>
<p>廿餘年來軍略變化　自上次大戰以來之二十餘年中，軍事策略與世界其他情形均有鉅大之變化，上述之批評家與自命爲軍事專家者，咸信兩戰塲之沈寂，係由於軸心之採取守　並以爲自軸心　撤　　尼　亞後，反軸心备　已在歐洲佔得軍事上之優勢。至於太平洋方面，則彼等粗信沙羅門戰事之沈寂情形，與阿茲　戰事之結果，均爲日本採取守勢之徵象。但此項批評家對上次大戰以來一切情形均已改變之事實，　　瞭然，而仍以之爲判斷之依據。</p>
<p>議論根據偏於一隅　反軸心之批評家皆以各國之相對的面積人力及具有軍事重要性各種資源爲其見解之根據，美國之專家自命者，更加入地理的因素在內，着重於美國　德義三　皆有海洋相隔離，惟彼等如相信上述各項因素　具有決定性質，則珠無根據以明瞭軸心　在此次戰事中之勝利，彼等不明　日本或已因中國事件而告力竭，何以竟能從事於大東亞戰事，並連續獲得　人之勝利，彼等夏不明瞭德國與義大利何以能在如此簡短時期內，攻佔由挪威以　　聯之各點，以及巴爾幹。</p>
<p>陳舊理論不合時宜　今日有企圖以陳舊與落伍之理論分析此次戰事者，已完全不合時事，即使此輩評論家之理論，　人稱之爲正當，但軸心各國之潛在戰鬥力，實遠非彼等心目中所料想之脆弱所可比　。須知德義兩國，物質上均極富强，以前言對食料及勞工感覺缺乏，但今日上述兩個因素已有充分之供給，且兩國工業之基礎，亦均　爲　固，此種情形，對於德國尤爲符合　德元首希特勒，現已完全控制國內之狀况，今日之德國人民，雖遭受與上次戰事中相同之痛苦，但　抱有忍受任何艱苦以獲勝之決心。至於義國之民氣，已完全與上次大戰中不同，雖在突尼西亞方面稱受損失，而毫無不安之情形。太平洋方面，日本擁有　　洲國以迄南太平洋領土中之　　，供其使用，其人力則萬衆一心，堅決　　，彼等殆可稱爲全世界雖一能爲國家作戰而忍受任何艱苦之人民，且更有十萬萬亞洲人民，明瞭日本之目標，並予以協助與合作，爲其後盾。</p>
<p>財富決勝殊欠充分　目前戰事之特殊性，　不能以人數或陳　戰略加以決定，歷史之趨向有利於軸心各圖，戰事　長愈久，反軕心各圖間之　擦將愈見　大，而其衰弱亦　愈見加甚，倘果如此　評論者所稱人數及對　可以決勝　　　無理由說明反軸心各圖何以不能阻止日方之南　，而日本竟毫無困難粉碎ABCD陣綫。歐洲方面，德國於關戰之後，未進攻者　六個月之久，惟一　發動，則數如破竹，　可　阻，今日兩戰塲之沉寂情形，或可解釋與歐洲開戰後之六個月，及東亞戰事爆發前之情形相同。</p>

<h3>秋山中佐披瀝　中日關係見解　闡釋共榮意義</h3>
<p>日大本營陸軍報道部員秋山中佐，昨日出席申報招待茶會席上，披瀝關於中日關係之過去現在與將來之見解。茲誌其要旨如次：</p>
<p>交還租界之重要性　余前與馮節先生會面曾謂不久之將來，日本交還在中國之租界。事經一年後，此次來滬，眼見中國即將恢復其自主權與獨立之尊嚴。余以前之臆測並無錯誤，此不但使我個人，即我日本一億　國民亦可自誇者。上海租界之交還與撤廢治外法欋同樣具有極重大意義，且不但對中國而已，即對大東亞全體亦具重大意義。關於治外法權之撤廢，在日本亦　以前日本與中國同樣有治外法欋之存在，當時我人咸痛感此於日本是何等之屈辱。在目下一般中國人士對此意義恐猶未深切了解，但今　後將日感此種意義之重大性。日本撤廢治外法權，是由於日本本身力最苦鬥而有以致之，在中國固亦爲中國所熱烈希望者，但余希望一般認識撤廢治外法欋與大東亞戰爭之進展有極深切之關係存在。蓋中國地大物博具有成爲世界第一强國之條件，但所以要受世界各國欺侮者，實因治外法權之存在，與中國領土內有外國租界存在之故，但今日桎梏中國手足之治外法權與租界存在得完全解除，中國得以　　　　　　於世界，能向自由之途進展。</p>
<p>日本意見轉捩關鍵　但余在此處，自本身及日本國民之立塲　甚表示煩累，蓋余向來攻撃在中國有租界及治外法權存在，但詢之以中國人曰日本對中國是否有租界及治外法權，則無一人答以「否」者，此點極表遺憾。若此處有一中國人，彼穩「君苟攻撃英國人之行爲，則對日本亦可作此言，君若稱英國爲海賊國，則日本亦　賊也，」余所稱感煩累即指此而言。日本於過去雖與英國同　壓迫中國。但余在此處得能發表含有重大意義之言論。此於日本除一部份知識　級外其餘尙未自覺，在中國亦更無認識，蓋日本　上海與英國同樣有公共租界，並於天津等地有專管租界，自此點言，日本與英國固　同樣，且當時設立租界之意義，　　日本或英國同在利益與特權。然嗣後日本對租界之憲義逐漸轉變，尤於大東亞戰爭發生後，日本對租界之意義與英國租界之意義問，已見一百八十度之轉變，余作此言，恐亦有認爲故弄巧辯者，但余相信日本知識階級對此有桷乎之自信，不久將有瀝史证明此言之器，日本前亦曾睹国家之命运出而一战，当时日本确抱有极大野心，企圖膨脹本國勢力，養成不能爲他國壓遺之辦量，故有此種舉動，日本曾於英國俄國德國法關西在威海衛　州灣等地　定外國利權　，即同樣隨在大陸設定利權，此不外爲日本祈求自嬰孩是爲成人之希望，逐見實現也，恐怕當時小小日本，已有遠大之美舉，恐不但在中國，即在印度波斯亦有　其成爲本身勢力範圍之美夢，但當時未具促其實現之辦量。其後日本自少年進入靑年時代，當轉移目光向中國而望見其沿岸各地均被制壓於外國利權之下，是時即感在此種狀態下，中國如陷於滅亡之命運，　日本果能存在乎。</p>
<p>安定東亞重大關心　於此靑年之日本與俄國一戰而捷，以後漸抱有自信，至此日本成爲東洋之安定勢力，對東洋之安定不得不懷有重大關心，日本之責任日益重大，同時還顧世界狀態，各國交通異常發達，無論自時間上自觀念上而說。與外國間之距離日見縮短，歐美情勢立即可影響及東洋，同時，東洋之情拋亦可立即影響至歐美，國際關係遂形複雜。當此時也，英美恃其强力壓迫東亞各國，對中國以經濟上之價值爲目標，伸其寬掌，最初自北方有國際共產黨展其寬手，日本中國滿洲均感受其威脅，此點且成爲日本朝鮮之重大關懷。此外，孫文先生所說明如無日本的無亞洲之　　　　，使日本人之頭腦漸漸感動，使人湧起中國必須具有本身安定勢力，日本必須成爲亞洲防波堤之觀念。余在七八年前，曾到華北其時前輩有稱日本之對華政策亦即對英政策，此言至今猶深坎余之尺中。日本爲增强途行戰爭之能力，不得不受華北鐵煤之供給，同時，在華北必須確立日本之勢力，以防止赤色勢力。</p>
<p>雙方誤會實感煩累　故日本謀在華北建　特殊勢力，中日雙方，若對此無誤解，以及蔣介石無不理解之態度，則中日關係必可完全諒解，但誤解並非中國一國之責任，而中日雙方均有責任。但當時日本爲防止澎湃之赤色勢力，迫於情勢，未得中國政府充分諒解，即實施其政策，當時之日本漸成壯年，成爲世界上之頭等國家，可以戰勝世界任何一國，但此時造成多數敵人存在，此因歐美各國均着眼於中國之經濟上價值，並且感到日本是彼等之實際敵人，歐美之對華野心愈强，日本之憂盧更深，至此日本重行檢討當時與英國在同　方式下說定之在華利權。經檢討結果，得到日本與歐美各國同其方式之結論，且歐美之侵略越進一步，日本之焦盧亦更深一層，痛感其部日本之對華政策未必妥當，但在華北及中國內部設定特殊權益，其目的並非在於企圖滅亡中國，係在對搞歐美各國，就避其毒手。因此歐美各國之租界若其目的在企圖分割中　　　中國，　　　　　發生加以防範之觀念，由於大東亞戰爭勃發，日本將存在於中國之英美敵性完全拭除，在此，日本必須改變現在之立塲，蓋吾人之權益，乃在於英美之對搞，故今日英美勢力已被拭除，若　英美之後而維持其勢力，則將被誤解爲日本對華包藏禍心矣。現在日本毅然交還租界，撤廢治外法權，日本人之心中，已感爽快之至，可以表示並無任何野心，與中國人民握手言歡，此誠幸甚。今後中國之事態，將見急速改善，日本亦希望　此。</p>
<p>窺測滬人一般見解　余此次來滬，每詢及中國人士，謂日本撤廢沼外法權是否正當，交還租界之舉感欣　乎，此問題對某種人士或許感覺奇異，日本交還租界撤廢治外法權，並非企求獲得任何利益，不過是當然的措置，萬一上海之中國人士不歡迎租界之交還與治外法權之撤廢，則於吾人反認爲重大之事態。苟率直言之，是否能說上海之人士，無不歡迎交還租界，每一中國人均對撤廢治外法權惑到　　，此事殊屬疑　。若上海人仍期望英美人所造成之繁榮，則此可表示上海人　已　爲英美人之奴　，日本希望甚至將日本所獲得之英美權益，一供還與中國，俾使中國日趨强大，然上海之一部份人士，若亦有不表示歡迎者，則其原因何在，蓋彼等認爲日本在戰事上已處收者之地位，如日本失敗，則國府協力日本或與日本携讓他　收囘英美之權益，係屬危險之事幫也。假使日本失敗，重慶及英美返至上海，則協力國府或日本晚感危險矣。但余可斷言日本爲日本本身，爲大東亞，爲中國極甸菲律賓，以至爲了全亞洲，必定獲得勝利而後已。若謂日本何故必能獲得勝利，余提出下列兩點分述之：</p>
<p>長期戰爭利害所在　日本在大東亞戰爭　發前，處於必敗地位，與中國人同樣被英美　　所束縛，但一旦奮起脫出此　鍊南進至新幾內亞。爪哇·緬甸·如此日本之勢力範圍日見擴大，其中包括世界上物資最豐之地域，此點在戰略上已確立必勝資態，不但如此，即使在長期戰爭中，亦已確立不敗之姿態，日本若維持現在情勢，開發鐵煤錫橡膠等資源，則無論數十年數百年，愈久愈佳。日本國民現在節衣縮食，但遠瞻南方各地情形，內心即感到欣慰茲舉一例，蘇門答臘所產石油，較自德國载、及羅馬尼亞獵得者爲多，此外，鐵煤以及美笑羅刹，此外，鐵煤以及美面所無法獲得之橡膠·錫·鐵·礬土等于关日本建设南方之事，澳洲寇丁首相曾有　　曰：「時問有助於日本」云云、但現在長期戰中，勝利之希望，並非在央視美而屬日本。此與大東亞戰爭發生以前之情勢至順利開發之日，則日本正凖備第二次發動攻勢，故在建設程序終了以前，確防</p>

<h3>從「靠父母」「靠朋友」說到「孝親」「敬友」</h3>
<p>— 大年</p>
<p>「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友，」是兩句盡人皆知的俗語，考其原意，無非是闡明：只有父母纔眞正的愛護他們的子女，所以子女在父母身邊，一切總是惟父母是賴。及至長大成人一脚跨進了社會，那末忠誠的朋友，也是不可或缺，因爲他們能濟人之急，助你完成你所不能做到的事情。但是，可引爲憾事的。少數人往往不肯稍用腦筋，去探求這兩句話的眞諦，地們單純地死記着一個「靠」字，「靠」即是「依賴」，社會上的「寄生蟲」，也就從這裏產生了！「寄生蟲」的貽害國家社會，固不必說，我們且從他們本身着想，誰曾見過他們之中，有一個得其善終？所以，父母，朋友並非皆不可「靠」，但不可不認淸自己的本位與立塲，忽略了自己的任務。世界上溺愛不明的父母未嘗沒有，但天下爲父母者孰不愛其子女？且愛之有軒輊，責之有輕重、豈非子女的貴不肖有以致之？交友有「白頭如新」，有「傾蓋如故」，有的人肯「捨命全交」，有的朋友却不時要乘機害你，雖然擇友有愼有不愼，你自己的「道德」「行爲」，總不失爲驅使對方的最大動力！是故「愛人者人恒愛之，敬人者人恒敬之。要「靠父母」「靠朋友」，還不是先要「靠自己」？那末，「卑親」「敬友」就是「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友。」這兩句話的言外之音了！</p>
<h3>苦茶</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>你也曾在飯餘酒後啜一杯苦茶嗎？</p>
<p>我便有吃苦茶的習慣。</p>
<p>我喜歡將濃洌的茶汁，滿滿地含在口中，讓那苦澀的味道，深深地滲入我的舌根。</p>
<p>不是我故意捨甘旨而取苦澀，要博得他人的一榮，世人那個不愛甘美的東西？但，天下之至味，執有能及苦茶的雋永沁心</p>
<p>正如黑色爲各種色彩的綜合，苦味乃是一切滋味的匯集。那穿紅戴綠的輕在男女，既不知黑色的尊貴；，則飫甘嗜肥的酒肉朋友，又豈能賞識苦味的美好？</p>
<p>無論吃一粒糖或咬一塊肉，你一把它嚥入了喉嚨，它的味道便消失了。有時吃得太多，反使人口中甜膩得討厭。可是，飲苦茶却絕不如此。</p>
<p>你啜了一口苦茶，覺得有些苦澀難受嗎？你且忍耐着慢慢地將它嚥下去吧！不一會，你覺得口腔中正在發生奇異的變化了，那舌根上的一點苦澀，已化成了滿頫的芬芳，那芬芳裏面，且帶着一股極淸永的甜味。但，這並不是糖果的甜味所能比擬，這是從苦澀之中生出來的滋味，你覺得這味道不錯吧！可是，不是你當初的一番忍耐着苦澀，又那裏來的這股甜味？</p>
<p>朋友，我告訴你：「吃苦茶如此，做人也並不例外」。眼前稍受委曲吃一些苦，正是未來甜蜜的基礎呢！是嗎？</p>
<h3>驕傲</h3>
<p>— 年祈</p>
<p>我們時常可以看貝有些人，往往因爲「偶有成就」或「徼倖成功」，便驕傲得什麽似的，並且還表示出一種「唯我獨尊」的態度。其實驕傲並不是表示一個人有高深偉大的學間和修養，相反的，正是表現一個人的無學問，無修養和鄙淺藐小。</p>
<p>驕傲有如陷阱，假使　道後。不想法早日脫離，在當時或許會自以爲很得意，但以後必定會感覺到以往的錯誤，而深加懊悔。</p>
<p>莎羅門說：「驕傲是毀滅的前導；一個意志傲慢的人，他的傾覆日子不遠了。」在一個人自從染了驕傲的惡習慣後，決不肯再做更進一步的硏究，那麽他怎不會被時代所淘汰呢？</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>談談超紫線</h3>
<p>— 秋士</p>
<p>「超紫線」這個名詞現在已爲一般人所熱聞。這種光綫究竟是什麽東四？其來源如何？其用途如何？這些在普遍一般人或許還不明瞭，現在把這幾點作一個簡單的說明。</p>
<p>「超紫綫」三字中「超」字的意義，是表示這種光綫是超於我們的視綫的，換言之，就是肉眼所不能見的。這種紫光（或紫綫）所以爲肉眼所不能見的綠故，是因爲它的波長（即光波的長度）過短，以致不能映入眼簾。</p>
<p>超紫線的來　有天然和人工二種。天然來源就是日光。原始人類無房屋居室，終日在日光之下，飽吸超紫線，所以膚色粗黑，體格强健。到了後來，文明漸啓，人們築室居住，少受日光，結果膚色慘白，體格脆弱，疾病易生。日光雖能從窗　中透入，但是日光中的超紫線因爲波長太短，不能透過普通的玻璃，所以在戶內生活的人享受不到超紫線的好處。至於超紫線的人工來源有炭弧光燈，　弧光燈，和內置其弧光和鎢絲的特種電燈，但總不及日光所會豐富而合於經濟</p>
<p>超紫線能使食物中所含的丁種維生素（俗稱維他命）數量增加所以牛乳牛油和穀類食品經過超紫線照射以後，了種維生素含量便形增加。軟骨病由於了種維生素缺乏所致，所以可用超紫線照射治療。牙齒欲其緊國，除飲食中須含有豐富的鈣質和燐質以外，又須有充份的　種維生素，我們知道魚肝油是丁種維生素的最豐富的來源，但是經過超紫線照射以後，其補力竟能增加數倍之鉅，超紫綫又具殺菌之力，所以患肺癆和皮膚病的人照射超紫線，往往得獲痊愈。除了在醫療和衛生方面的功用以外，超紫線在科學試騐，攝影，和工業方面也都有用處。</p>
<p>從上面看來。我們知道我們必須有充份的超紫線。都市裏面的居民，大部份時間在屋子裏面過生活，而普通的玻璃窗又不能讓超紫線透入，以致不能多享此種光綫的益處，影響健康，實爲憾事。裝置特種可以使超紫線透過的玻璃窗子，固屬佳事，但是價值昻貴，非一般人所能勝任，所以最經濟實惠的辦法莫如多過戶外生活，俾得充份吸收超紫線。</p>
<h3>白茅集</h3>
<p>— 歐陽夢藟</p>
<p>不要專揀聰明的事做，否則世上的？　事誰去幹呢？</p>
<p>精神不集中是一個人的致命傷，工作無計劃是生命的浪費。</p>
<p>眞正能使人奮發有爲倒並不是別人的「讚揚」和「鼓勵」，而是些「譏諷」，「嘲笑」和一些「刻薄話」。我以爲。</p>
<p>沒有對立，便沒有進步，沒有矛盾，何來發展，我們人人生活在矛盾中，引力與反駁，理智與情感，愛與憎……這些是人類的生存，與社會的進展所必需的。</p>
<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>一個殘秋的傍晚，溫和的太陽，在天空西北角慢慢地向水平綫以下躲去，整個天空佈滿了晚霞，這晚霞雖然沒有暮春時候的美麗可愛，可是農人們於整天辛苦勞作之餘，卸却征衣，抬頭瞭望瞭望，却也足夠舒暢心胸，恢復疲勞了。畢竟是大自然給予人們的一份慰勞品啊！</p>
<p>「爸！不要再去做哩！息息吧！」一個十一二歲模樣的女孩子——秀寳，一邊在喙……喙……喙的呼着她一手飼養長成的幾隻母鷄，趕牠們往木棚去憇息，一邊看見她的父親手裏拿了一把鐮刀，還要去做工。她不忍爸太辛苦。接着說：</p>
<p>「天快要黑了，整天的辛苦已經夠累了，不是明天也好做的嗎？爸歇歇吧！」</p>
<p>「秀寶，你不知道的，明天還有明天的事，宅邊溟溝裏的蘆葦，快要枯了，我想把它割了，晒晒乾可以當幾天柴燒，現在柴很貴，不能不打算。我去去就來的，你乖乖地趕了鷄，就收拾收拾預備夜飯吧、」秀寶的父親——阿坤，已是將近五十來歲的人了，在田地中過着他的一生，這年頭更見蒼老辛苦了。他一邊說着一邊提着鈍重的脚步，走向離宅不遠的溟溝，跣着足，捲起褲脚，站在已有冷意的水裏，拿起鐮刀，割取垂枯的蘆葷。</p>
<p>「不！不！不肯的！這幾只鷄，正在生蛋，我們一家的油，　，都靠它換取的。不！不！……不肯的！」阿坤正在颼颼地割蘆葦，驀然地聽到宅上他女兒的哭嚷聲，一邊咯：咯咯咯的母鷄也在飛撲着的掙扎聲。</p>
<p>「怎麼的！剛才不是好好的在招呼鷄子宿棚，難道有人來要鷄不成？」阿坤停了停手裏的鐮刀，在這樣的想着：「唷！不好了！不是聽見人說過，××隊裏的老爺，頂歡喜吃鷄和鷄蛋，常常到鄉下去不管肯不肯的提了就走。今天早晨，我到鎮上買油去，聽說我們的鎭上到了什麽「……全省海上××司令×」的隊部，這一囘的倒霉，不是要輪到我頭上來了。」阿坤想到這裏，就把鐮刀撥開蘆葦叢，探頭向宅上一望，果然看見一個穿着灰布衣，戴着軟平頂帽，綁着腿布的傢伙，正在趕着鷄，看上去這傢伙還不過是十四五歲的大孩子，怎麼會這樣的膽大呢？</p>
<p>「不肯的！我們一家靠這幾只鷄過活的，你要吃牠，就吃我們的命，求你老爺饒下了吧！」阿坤禁不住在水裏跳起，喊出聲來。（一）</p>

<h3>How to Accept the Generous Gift from Our Friendly Neighbor, Japan</h3>
<p>China unfortunately suffered from invasions by Britain and the United States a century ago, which led to the establishment of unequal treaties such as concessions and extraterritorial rights. For a century, Britain and the United States used the concessions as bases to restrain our freedom, deprive us of our rights and interests, and inflict upon us the pain granted by the unequal treaties. This was forced to change with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which swept away the British and American forces of aggression in China. This spring, our friendly neighbor Japan transformed its new policy towards China, the concrete manifestation of which is the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. In addition to deciding to return the concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou, Xiamen, and other places, the preparations for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement were also officially signed in the capital yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not only an important city in China but also an important commercial port in East Asia, and it has always been the center of China's economy, politics, and culture. Now, our friendly neighbor Japan is resolutely preparing to return the International Settlement to our country, which will eliminate the shackles that have deprived us of freedom for a century. Not only will we feel relieved spiritually, but also the various unreasonable phenomena that were based on the concessions will also be adjusted from now on, allowing the country to implement political, economic, and cultural policies without hindrance. Our people feel that this generous gift from our friendly neighbor Japan cannot be fully expressed with ordinary words of gratitude.</p>
<p>After accepting this generous gift, we should not simply be pleased and dispose of it casually. We must understand that Japan's preparation to return the concessions is in the hope that we will be independent and autonomous. How we should be inspired and motivated to complete the task of independence and autonomy, in order to live up to the expectations of our friendly neighbor, is what the government and the people, especially the citizens of Shanghai, should earnestly reflect on and be vigilant about today.</p>
<p>However, among the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as far as the current facts are concerned, China's national conditions are the most complex. It has only the outward appearance of vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, but lacks the substance of modern national economic construction and political progress. Therefore, it has become the weakest link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This can be proven by two facts: (1) Prices are the highest. Whether in Japan or in various parts of Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, Batavia, Hong Kong, etc., the degree of price increases is by no means as great as in China, especially the alarming state in Shanghai. (2) The restoration of order in various parts of Southeast Asia after the Greater East Asia War was exceptionally rapid, and economic construction was actively promoted and extremely successful. Looking back at our country, on the other hand, reconstruction has stagnated and production has decreased. This has fully demonstrated that China's current situation is the weakest link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Amidst the voices of returning the concessions, we should first reflect and hope that the common attention of the Sino-Japanese situation will be paid to the existence of this fact.</p>
<p>This time, Japan's move to return the concessions has been compared by friendly people to Japan's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights during the Meiji Restoration era. But these are humble words from friendly people. We know that when Japan was in the Meiji Restoration era, its national power became stronger day by day, and its judicial credibility was established. The movement to recover concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights was achieved through the efforts of the entire nation. This time, China's recovery of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights is entirely due to the result of Japan's transformation of its new policy toward China, which voluntarily returned them, not due to the achievements we have made as our national power has become stronger. Our government and people should also deeply reflect on this and not have feelings of complacency.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should know that in Japan's new policy towards China, these two things are only the beginning of respecting our country's independence and autonomy. In other words, it is still a kind of test for our political independence. Therefore, after we accept it, we can only move forward on the path of working hard to do well and fully demonstrate our ability to be independent and autonomous. This is also what we should reflect on and be deeply vigilant about.</p>
<p>We hope that the authorities of our friendly neighbor will not only implement the new policy by returning the concessions but will also further assist China in completing the steps towards independence and autonomy. Unreserved guidance should be given to all the political systems, economic construction plans, and implementation steps that a modern country should have. This is the sincere wish of our people.</p>
<p>Regarding the major issue of returning the Shanghai International Settlement, there are many places that need to be discussed. We will now briefly state our humble opinions on the prerequisite issues:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the return of the International Settlement, our people should understand its importance to national sovereignty and cooperate automatically and unanimously. We hope that our government, on the day of implementation of the return, will simultaneously establish a Shanghai citizens' opinion organization. The selection of personnel does not need to be too many, but their qualifications, prestige, and credibility must be sufficient to represent the citizens as the only condition.</p>
<p>(2) The civil servants who are currently serving in various agencies in the International Settlement should not be changed casually, but should be based on the principle of employing people according to their talents. Newcomers should not be abused, and maintaining the past advantages should be the only principle during the current transition period.</p>
<p>We believe that Japan's practice of its new policy towards China is becoming more and more concrete and is by no means empty talk. On this day when Sino-Japanese relations are further improving, it is most worthy of being seriously proposed for consideration by the Chinese people who have been suspicious of Japanese policy since the Greater East Asia War. We must recognize our "friends" and "enemies" clearly in order to have a path to China's revival in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, we warmly expect the authorities of our friendly neighbor France to have the same spirit and voluntarily return the French Concession in Shanghai as soon as possible, not letting Japan be the only one to do so, and to form an eternal friendship between China and France.</p>

<p>Japanese Press Release</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:00 PM on the 30th that the Japanese government has recently instructed the Japanese Ambassador to China to discuss with the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs matters concerning the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, etc., by the government of the Republic of China, based on Article 4 of the "Agreement between Japan and the Republic of China on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights" concluded with the National Government of the Republic of China on January 9th of this year. The opinions of both parties have now completely coincided, and the signing ceremony for the agreement on the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement and the matters of understanding was held in Nanjing today.</p>
<p>Key Points of Ambassador Tani's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At the signing ceremony for the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement today, Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki said: After the Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, China and Japan immediately issued a joint declaration on cooperating to complete the war. At the same time, the Empire also decided to return all concessions and abolish privileges such as extraterritorial rights in China. As soon as the two countries concluded an agreement on this matter, Sino-Japanese relations entered a landmark stage. It has only been six months since then. In the meantime, the Japanese exclusive concessions in Tianjin and other places have been returned in March, and the National Government has recovered the Gulangyu International Settlement and the Peking Legation Quarter. On June 5th, France also returned its exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. Now, I am pleased to sign with Minister Chu the agreement on the implementation of the recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement and the matters of understanding, and it will be implemented on August 1st, so that the concession issue can be finally resolved. In this way, the policies made clear by the Imperial Government have been steadily realized, and the establishment of this agreement and matters of understanding is one of its manifestations. I expect that the Shanghai International Settlement in the future can become a major foundation for China's revival and prosperity, and I am even more convinced that the Chinese government authorities and the Chinese people will be able to promote this great significance.</p>
<p>Main Points of Foreign Minister Chu's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At the ceremony for the signing of the Sino-Japanese agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government said in his speech: On January 9th of this year, after our country joined the war, your country concluded an agreement with our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights in order to assist the independent development of our country. On March 30th of this year, your country has returned all the exclusive concessions in China, and on June 5th, our country successively received the French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Today, I am very pleased to sign with you the clauses and understanding matters regarding the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement. Since the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement, Britain and the United States have used it as the largest base for invading China, hindering our country's sovereignty and impeding our country's development. Today, we have signed the clauses and agreement on the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, and it will be implemented on August 1st. After the Shanghai French Concession and the Italian Concession in Tianjin are returned, our country's long-cherished hope will be completely realized, and the gratitude of our entire country cannot be expressed in words. After our country recovers it, we will do our best in its management and operation to promote the well-being of the Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Premier Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - After the signing of the agreement on the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan said: Since our friendly neighbor Japan and our country concluded an agreement on January 9th of this year, the exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places have been returned first, and recently the return of the Shanghai International Settlement has been completed today. For a century, the Shanghai International Settlement has been the base for the aggression of the British and the Americans, who plundered it in economic terms and anesthetized it in cultural terms. As a result, China's spirit and material resources have fallen into the abyss of opium. Now, with the strong assistance of our friendly neighbor Japan, the haze of a century has been swept away, and we are sincerely grateful. However, the enthusiasm of the people cannot be expressed in the words "thank you." We must deeply reflect on the importance of the mission and know the difficulty of shouldering it. We must cherish its enthusiasm and do our best to make the Shanghai International Settlement more stable and prosperous. We must especially make the Shanghai International Settlement, in both spiritual and material terms, thoroughly wash away the toxins that have been immersed by the British and Americans for a century. This base of British and American imperialism will be transformed into a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, a link for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and a transportation hub for world peace. There are many things that need the cooperation of the government and the people after the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. We should take on everything with a spirit of progress to fulfill the legacy of the National Father to abolish unequal treaties, live up to the great intentions of our friendly neighbor Japan, and live up to the ardent expectations of the national people. We also hope that other countries concerned will follow our friendly neighbor Japan and quickly implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, and make their best efforts to consult with France to ensure that the return of the Shanghai French Concession can be realized no later than August 1st of this year.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Remarks</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the signing of the agreement and understanding matters between China and Japan regarding the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement by the National Government, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement, saying: The establishment of concessions in China, especially the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement, began after the Opium War. Thereafter, Britain and the United States used these concessions as solid bases for dominating China in political, economic, and cultural terms, and accumulated enormous rights and interests, and tried their best to preserve their existence. Therefore, the existence of the Shanghai International Settlement is a major obstacle to China's revival and can also be said to be a burden on the construction of Greater East Asia. After the recovery by the National Government this time, it will be, in name and in fact, a part of Shanghai, the economic center of the Republic of China, and will be renewed and redeveloped under the character of East Asia. In terms of the importance it will occupy in the future, it is truly worth expecting its strengthening of the power of the National Government and the revival of China. The Japanese government is confident that the National Government will be able to take on the heavy responsibility of rebuilding the area with unwavering determination.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, Ambassador Tani issued a statement, saying: The Sino-Japanese agreement and matters of understanding on the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement have been signed and completed, and the Empire will implement the administrative power of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st, which I am very pleased with. Recalling that after Shanghai was opened as a commercial port after the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing in the Opium War, Britain, France, and other countries successively established concessions in Shanghai, and the United States also virtually established concessions inside China, and used them as bases for aggression in East Asia. Centering on Shanghai, it grasped the power of trade, set up customs in its own concessions, and used the concessions as bases to grasp power and monopolize transportation rights such as railways and shipping. In 1898, it asked the Qing government to recognize the Yangtze River area as the scope of British labor. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, Britain, the United States, and France took the same steps to resist it. Soon after, at the suggestion of the United States, the British Concession was changed into an International Settlement managed by various countries. Therefore, under the character of a British and American colony, Shanghai became a major obstacle to China's independent development. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Chinese revolutionaries have launched heroic struggles to recover this special area, but Britain has often used both hard and soft tactics to lure various countries and prevent the realization of the demands of the Chinese people, with the aim of using Shanghai as a base to disrupt East Asia. However, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army won the final victory, and in January of this year, China declared war on Britain and the United States, and the British and American rights and interests in Shanghai were fundamentally eliminated. This recovery of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement can be said to be the finishing touch, completing the ideal of independence and self-government that the National Father Sun Yat-sen has always demanded, and moving towards the liberation of East Asia. I am truly pleased. Today, I, the Japanese ambassador, signed the agreement on the return of the administrative power of the International Settlement, which is the implementation of Japan's promise to China. The Japanese government is determined to implement what it has promised, and this can be clearly understood. In the future, I will follow the orders of the government to gradually implement what the Empire and the National Government have promised, and this is my greatest mission.</p>

<h3>Details of Enemy Property in Guangdong-Hankou Transferred from Japan to Our Country</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) - Among the enemy properties in the Guangdong region transferred by Japan this time, there are 16 cultural institutions, 12 hospitals, and 80 churches. The main ones belong to the American system, and Lingnan University is one of them. When the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, the school moved all 170,000 volumes of its paintings to Hong Kong. In September of the 39th year of the Republic of China, it was operated by the Guangdong Provincial Government under the management of the Japanese army, and Lin Ruheheng, the director of education, concurrently served as the president. It reopened and was renamed Guangdong University, and now has 450 male and female students. In addition, Rouji and Dabao Luo Hospitals and the Liangguang Baptist Hospital are all in Guangzhou. Middle schools and others are scattered in Zhongshan and Nanhai. As a result of this transfer, all will be managed by China. There are a total of 40 factories returned, 80% of which are lace factories in the Shantou area. Before the Greater East Asia War, these factories were operated by Chinese with the assistance of British and American capital and technology; after the outbreak of the war, they did not stop work. In addition, there are six companies, which are also stores selling products from lace factories in the Shantou area, including four American companies and two British companies. There are seven guilds, four in Guangzhou and three in Shantou.</p>
<p>Hankou, 30th (Central News Agency) - The enemy property transferred by the Japanese side to the National Government this time amounts to 461 items, including warehouses, machinery factories, power plants, printing factories, packing factories, food industry companies, automobile factories, church schools, etc., totaling 121 items in the Hankou area. The main ones include the Asia Petroleum Building, Jingming Building, Heji Factory, Huazhong Printing Bureau, and Hankou Electric Light Company. In addition, this is the first decision by the Japanese side to transfer the enemy property in the Hankou area to the National Government, and it will continue to implement the transfer in the future.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Japanese Army Authorities in South China</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - The main points of the remarks by the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army authorities on the second transfer of enemy property to our country by Japan are as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army immediately took over the British and American enemy areas, placed them under military management, and reorganized them. This time, according to the decision of the Japanese government to transfer enemy property for the second time, the enemy property in the areas of Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shantou (this report is for the first time) is transferred to China. The British and American enemy property transferred this time has been used by Britain and the United States for a hundred years as bases for extracting China's economy or invading China in the name of culture. Now that it is under the management of China, it will be improved and operated as the property of the new China. This will surely make a great contribution to the construction of the new East Asia.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Philippine Independence Committee Expresses Aspirations</h3>
<p>Manila, 30th (Central News Agency): Philippine Interior Minister Laurel, after being ambushed on June 5th, was treated at the Philippine General Hospital. His condition has improved significantly, and he is about to be discharged. Laurel expressed his aspirations regarding his appointment as Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee on the 29th, as follows: "I have been chosen as the Chairman of the Independence Preparatory Committee, and have been formally appointed by the highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines. I am aware of my limited abilities and the heavy responsibility, making it difficult to meet expectations. Therefore, I hope that all members will assist with patriotic fervor. I am now undertaking this important task. Since the Japanese army entered Manila, the people of the Philippines, under heavy pressure from the United States, have been liberated and are advancing in cooperation with Japan. Japan has declared that it has no intention of conquering or dominating the Philippines. Prime Minister Tojo has also declared that the Philippines will be granted independence this year. Therefore, the Independence Preparatory Committee was established and has been recognized by the highest commander of the Japanese Army. I am of limited talent and knowledge, and it is questionable whether I can do any good during my term. However, with the assistance and encouragement of my people, I am determined to do my best to overcome difficulties and build a glorious new nation within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Offensive and Defensive Battles Between German and Soviet Armies - Soviets Launch Offensive at Kuban Bridgehead - Germans Take Initiative in Southern Sector</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency): Since the 28th, the battle for positions between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front has intensified, with large-scale offensive and defensive battles breaking out at almost all crucial points. On the central front, the Soviets are on the offensive, except at the Kuban bridgehead, while on the southern front, the Germans are taking the initiative. The situation on each front is as follows: 1. From the afternoon of the 28th to the 29th, the Soviet army launched several strong attacks in the Velikiye Luki and Staraya Russa regions northwest of Moscow, and also launched a fierce offensive against German positions in the Spas-Demensk region east of Smolensk with substantial forces, resulting in fierce fighting. The German authorities, aware that the Soviet army had amassed a large force from the area to the rear of the Kirov front, had already prepared thoroughly. 2. On the southern front, the German army launched an offensive at dawn on the 29th in the Lisichansk, Izium, and Svyatogorsk regions. In particular, the German army south of Izium took advantage of the Soviet army's feigned attack and launched a strong assault on the vacillating Soviet positions southeast of the Donets River. 3. At the Kuban bridgehead, the Soviet army launched another offensive in the southwestern and northwestern areas of Krymskaya. After a short period of hand-to-hand combat, the Soviet forces were repelled. In addition, the Soviet army attempted to land on the western tip of the Taman Peninsula but failed, losing eleven landing craft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): The German military authorities announced on the 29th that the German Air Force fighter squadrons shot down a total of 172 Soviet planes on the Eastern Front in the week from the 22nd to the 26th of this month, with only 18 German planes lost. From June 1st to June 27th, German forces shot down 948 Soviet planes on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>German Planes Attack Pantelleria</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency): Major Freytag, an air force correspondent for the "German New Agency", stated that German Junkers bombers, undeterred by the concentration of British fighters, damaged four enemy cargo ships in the port of Pantelleria. Two port facilities were hit and caught fire, destroying a large quantity of war materiel. During the German bomber raid on the Pantelleria airfield, eleven British planes were destroyed. Only one German plane failed to return after the operation.</p>
<h3>Giraud's Trip to America Postponed Again</h3>
<p>Tangier, 30th (Central News Agency): According to Havas News Agency in Algiers, the French Committee of National Liberation announced at the end of its meeting on Tuesday that Giraud's planned trip to America had been postponed again. Speculation about Giraud's trip to America and the possible developments due to Trogier's remaining in Algiers has subsided as a result of this announcement. When Giraud eventually goes to America, he will discuss the reorganization of the French army in North Africa with President Roosevelt. At yesterday's committee meeting, chaired by Giraud, the committee discussed and finally accepted the resignation of Boisson, the Governor-General of French West Africa, and decided to establish a "Youth Committee" affiliated with the Ministry of the Interior.</p>
<h3>British Military Expert Discusses Anglo-American Invasion of Europe</h3>
<p>Geneva, 29th (Central News Agency): Captain Liddell Hart, a well-known British military commentator, published an article in the "Daily Mail" reiterating the various dangers of invading Europe to his countrymen. Captain Liddell Hart stated that the dangers of procrastination and inadequate preparation are equal. The long-publicized Anglo-American attempt at a second front has been delayed precisely because of the need for thorough preparation. The British people have only recently realized the extent of the preparation needed, given the strength of the Axis defense. The public has also realized the significant problems faced by the Anglo-American invasion of Europe. The British people often hear that what is needed in this war is an offensive, and this illusion has gained traction due to the success of the German offensive in 1940. However, an offensive is not the only need; the British and Americans must realize this. No belligerent nation has ever faced such a long and arduous future as the Anglo-Americans currently do. The Anglo-Americans have made mutual promises and promised the world that their enemies will surrender unconditionally. However, given the Axis's strong position in Europe, this promise is not easy to fulfill. It must be understood that the enemy is currently working hard to make America's efforts more difficult, even to the point of collapse. Liddell Hart concluded by saying that the best opportunity for the Anglo-Americans lies in developing defensive "new tools and new methods."</p>

<h3>Spreading Strike Wave in America Greatly Impacts Military Supplies Industry Factories Manufacturing Aircraft, Tanks, etc., Announce Shutdown Roosevelt Consults with Interior Secretary Ickes on Solutions</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): According to dispatches from Washington and Detroit, it was generally believed that President Roosevelt was now preparing to personally appeal to the nation regarding the government's views on domestic labor disputes. However, work had not resumed yesterday, and more than half of the workers at the Chrysler Corporation's Highland Park Arsenal in Michigan did not report for the night shift on Monday evening. Because the anti-strike law was passed by Congress on Friday, the strike at the Highland Park Arsenal has set a new record for large-scale labor unrest in the United States. The production of tanks, artillery, aircraft engines, and heavy trucks used by the military at that factory has been shut down. President Roosevelt consulted with Interior Secretary Ickes yesterday. The American people are now eagerly awaiting government action under the strict anti-strike law to force thousands of striking miners to return to work. Yesterday, another furnace in Alabama was shut down due to the sudden reduction in coal production in the state and the gradual depletion of fuel stored by steel companies. Of the 24,000 miners in the state, only over 3,000 are currently working. All 60,000 miners in Kentucky have resumed work, and miners in Pennsylvania are also gradually resuming work, but in other areas, there are still a number of absenteeism incidents continuing to occur. In some areas of Pennsylvania, thousands of workers are still holding out, demanding increased wages. According to the latest news from various mines in the United States, 39,000 miners still resisted the government and their leader, Lewis, yesterday.</p>
<h3>Food Problems in Britain and America (1)</h3>
<p>America</p>
<p>Last year, the value of American agricultural production increased by 14% compared to the previous year, exceeding the 12% increase in 1938 and creating a new record. For example, wheat increased from 943 million bushels (unit of measurement, each bushel is 8 gallons) in 1941 to 981 million bushels. Corn increased from 2.672 billion bushels to 3.175 billion bushels. Meat also reached a record 21 billion pounds. According to estimates by the authorities, this year it could increase even further. According to the production targets for this year announced by Agriculture Secretary Wickard last November, the figures for various items other than wheat are greatly increased compared to last year, and Wickard emphasized that this is the minimum necessary amount. The figures are as follows:</p>
<p>Meat 25 billion pounds (16% increase from last year), chicken 4 billion pounds (28% increase), corn increase 4%, potatoes increase 10%, milk dry matter 22 billion pounds (increase 2 billion pounds), wheat reduced by 900,000 acres from 52.5 million acres.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual state of American food production, it has gradually deteriorated since the second half of last year. Whether Carter's production increase target for this year can be achieved as planned is doubtful. A quarter of all American agricultural products are reserved for use by the United States and the anti-Axis forces. The Soviet Union and Britain have requested an increase in food exports this year, especially an increase in exports to the Soviet Union, which is inevitable. On the other hand, domestic inflation is also increasing the demand for food among the American public. To cope with these domestic and foreign demands, American food policy is becoming more difficult. As a result, the American countryside has shouldered an extraordinary burden to carry out the war. The actual reasons hindering the realization of increased production are: first, the lack of labor; second, the lack of agricultural machinery; third, the pressure on transportation; and fourth, agricultural product prices are lower than the general price level. The main reason for the lack of rural labor is that rural workers are leaving the countryside one after another, enticed by the high wages of military and industrial industries, and due to the increase in conscription into the army and navy. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has completely banned the manufacture of agricultural machinery, so its supply is currently insufficient. As a result, food shortages are becoming widespread throughout the country, and a rationing system has been implemented for almost all food items. Members of the House of Representatives rural group are taking measures to curb Roosevelt's agricultural policy in order to alleviate this plight in the countryside, often attacking the government. Roosevelt succumbed to the stubborn offensive of rural members, and in March of this year, Davis replaced Wickard, who had been concurrently serving as Food Administrator, in order to adapt to their wishes and adopt various agricultural policies. The labor countermeasures first temporarily ordered 500,000 soldiers from rural areas to return to farming, and temporarily postponed the call-up of 3 million rural men this year. In addition, it was decided to import 50,000 workers from Mexico, 10,000 from Jamaica, and 2,000 from Havana. In addition, students and women are being mobilized to engage in short-term labor, and an "Agricultural Labor Volunteer Corps" has been organized, with a membership of 400,000. As for agricultural machinery, the War Production Board has decided to allocate 30% of the copper and iron normally required for the manufacture of agricultural machinery in order to meet the needs of the countryside. In addition, it is planned to popularize small farms called "Victory Gardens" among the general public, and a large-scale movement is currently underway with the goal of creating 18 million farms.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Wickard announced a plan to open 12 million "Victory Gardens" in cities and 6 million in rural areas, and the Department of Agriculture is devoting all its efforts to allocating fertilizer and providing cultivation guidance to these Victory Gardens.</p>
<p>To make farmers enthusiastic about increasing production, agricultural product prices must first be raised. This is the actual situation of American farmers. The government's policy has always been to oppose raising agricultural product prices by only giving production subsidies to each farm. Rural areas demand higher prices, arguing that agricultural products and other prices should be kept in balance, recognizing the balanced price. In response, the government focuses on preventing the rise of general production costs in the United States, and does not intend to accommodate the demands of rural areas, except to compensate agricultural product producers for a portion of their production costs. Although rural members' bills to raise agricultural product prices have passed both houses of Congress, Roosevelt has rejected them and sent them back to the Senate for review. The government's discord with rural areas is a major obstacle to America's war effort. In addition to the government's flawed agricultural policy, the expected harvest of agricultural products is tending towards pessimism.

<h3>Agreement on the Return of the Public Concession Signed. Shanghai City Extremely Excited. Okazaki Discusses His Administration's Achievements During His Tenure.</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) The National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement in Nanjing yesterday with friendly nation Japan to return the Shanghai Public Concession. All sectors of the city are rejoicing and deeply admire our friendly nation's cooperation with our country. Tang Min, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement saying, "From now on, Shanghai Special City will truly become Shanghai Special City. We must make tenfold efforts to make Shanghai Special City a model city for our country, so as not to betray our long-cherished ambitions and the good intentions of our friendly nations in returning the concessions."凌文, Director of the Municipal Government, also issued a statement saying, "The recovery of the Public Concession in this port has been realized, which demonstrates the spirit of our friendly nation in respecting our sovereignty and their noble courage and good intentions. Not only are our party comrades excited, but the people of the whole country are also grateful."</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Statement: Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) Regarding the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, Mayor Chen of Shanghai issued a statement yesterday saying: "This time, Japan, with the spirit of assisting China's independence and freedom, has promoted the realization of the return of the Shanghai Public Concession. Japan has not only been the first to return its exclusive concession, but its far-sighted ideals, sincere friendship, and great courage have deeply moved the Chinese people, who are fighting shoulder to shoulder in the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>"As for the French Concession issue, if the administrative power of the French Concession is not returned for a single day, the Shanghai municipality will still be incomplete, and China's administrative power will also be incomplete. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will recognize the seriousness of this and return the French Concession at the same time as the Public Concession on August 1st. This move will not only make a great contribution to Shanghai's security but also fulfill France's promises and increase Sino-French friendship. I sincerely hope that the French authorities will deeply realize this based on the long-standing friendship between China and France."</p>
<p>"After the simultaneous recovery of the Public Concession and the French Concession, Shanghai still faces many problems, such as how to make reasonable adjustments to the region, how to increase the efficiency of security, and how to quickly start construction. These should be jointly addressed by all citizens of Shanghai and the municipal government. Then, Shanghai's prosperity and peace can be expected." Mayor Chen also issued a statement to the people of the city regarding the signing of the articles for the recovery of the Public Concession, hoping that all citizens will cooperate in building a new and great Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri's Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, Minister Tajiri stated that the agreement for the implementation of the return of the administrative power of the Shanghai Public Concession was signed by China and Japan on June 30th. The Shanghai Public Concession will be recovered by China from August 1st. Looking back to the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China was immediately expelled, and the power of Britain and the United States in the Greater East Asia region was completely destroyed and eliminated. As a result, China and Japan were able to return to their natural state, no longer subject to any manipulation or obstruction from their old enemies, Britain and the United States, and could work together to achieve their goals. Based on this, Japan decided to realize an epoch-making leap in the friendly relations between China and Japan, and on January 9th, abolished extraterritoriality and concluded a principle agreement on the return of concessions, etc., in order to first contribute to China's political independence and integrity. After that, Japan actively promoted this policy towards China. The Japanese concessions in various parts of China have already been returned, and the return of the Xiamen Public Concession and the Beijing Legation Quarter is also being gradually implemented. Now, the Shanghai Public Concession will also be returned in one month. The Shanghai Public Concession originated about a century ago, as a result of the Opium War, and was designated as a residential area for the British according to the Treaty of Nanjing. Later, it merged with the American Concession to become the Public Concession. For a century, it has been the largest stronghold of Anglo-American aggression. Its administrative power has always been solely controlled by the British and Americans. The Shanghai Concession, which was established as a residential area, has become a colony that infringes on China's independence and sovereignty, a stronghold that promotes China's internal strife, and the source of all conspiracies and tactics to alienate the friendly relations between China and Japan and incite conflict. This major obstacle to the prosperity of East Asia was only eliminated after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, in view of China's actual situation and the situation in East Asia, we had no choice but to endure this humiliating history for a long period of one hundred years. Therefore, the return of the Shanghai Public Concession is a natural measure that the Empire, which has always sincerely hoped for China's prosperity, must take. From China's perspective, it can be said that the source of aggression in East Asia, which has been a long-standing grievance, will be permanently eliminated, and long-standing hopes will be realized at once. Moreover, Japan's true intention in taking this measure is not only understood by China, but it is also deeply believed that related third countries such as France and Italy can fully understand it. If the Italian Concession in Tianjin and the French Concession in Shanghai can be recovered before August 1st with the understanding attitude of France and Italy, then China's sovereignty over the concession issue will be independently achieved first, which will be a landmark and major event in relationship. I hope that the Chinese people will increasingly promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, and I wish the participating China a leap forward. At the same time, I hope that the Japanese in China will also fully understand the Japanese government's intentions, implement the government's policies, and cooperate together.</p>
<p>Statement by Okazaki, Director-General of the Board of Works: Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Board of Works, on the occasion of the upcoming return of the Board of Works, specially issued the following statement on his painstaking efforts in management: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, I was ordered to take office as Director-General of the Board of Works. At that time, it was like going deep into enemy territory alone, and my mood was exceptionally tragic. However, the then Director-General Liddell (British) and General Manager Philips (British) were both well-known to me in the past. Therefore, although they were nationals of enemy countries, they still cooperated with the Japanese side in many ways in order to maintain security within the concession. As a result, the affairs proceeded unexpectedly easily. When I entered the Board of Works, I had five considerations in mind: (1) Eliminate the hostile elements within the Board of Works, (2) Maintain the existing efficiency, (3) Ensure security, (4) Stabilize the people's livelihood, and (5) Strengthen finances. The first, eliminating hostile elements, and the second, maintaining efficiency, are closely related. At the same time, it was extremely difficult to solve these two problems. At that time, there were nearly 300 nationals of enemy countries among the employees of the Board of Works, most of whom had served for 20 or 30 years. Therefore, if they were all dismissed at once, the administrative efficiency would inevitably decline. Therefore, I decided to adopt a gradual approach and gradually change the lineup after the Japanese side obtained suitable talents. In this way, it took more than a year for all the hostile personnel to leave their posts. However, for a century, the Board of Works had been controlled by Britain and the United States, and the Anglo-American colors were extremely strong. As a result, the organizational structure of the Board of Works still retained the Anglo-American form, and the same was true for the language. Although Japanese was used to some extent, English was still used. The issue of changing the English street names and removing the statues of British people has not yet been resolved, which is also due to the gradual approach taken to maintain efficiency. It was really unavoidable. In order to maintain efficiency, I adopted a cautious attitude. Therefore, since the Board of Works was taken over by the Japanese side, the operation of the municipal administration has always been extremely smooth, without any obstacles. Thirdly, regarding</p>
<p>Ensuring Security: The security in Shanghai was extremely poor before March of this year. Terrorist bombings and other incidents occurred frequently every day. Therefore, the police of the Board of Works were fundamentally reorganized. At the same time, the extremely difficult work of organizing the Baojia system was started. At first, all parties expressed opposition to the Baojia organization, and there were many discussions. Some said that the Baojia organization was definitely impossible, and others said that it would increase the burden on the citizens and was not suitable. However, in the end, this opposition was overcome, and the organization of the Baojia was started. This Baojia system has been quite effective in maintaining security. The characteristic of the Baojia system of the Board of Works is that it does not increase the financial burden on the citizens, but only requires them to provide labor. Therefore, the budget of the Board of Works for this year specifically included 10 million yuan for Baojia expenses. After that, the citizens abandoned their previous hands-off attitude towards the Baojia system and cooperated earnestly, and the situation was surprisingly good. Shanghai, which had been plagued by frequent crimes, has now been transformed into a bright Shanghai. This is largely due to the efforts of the Japanese Army and Navy, but the achievements of the Baojia Corps cannot be ignored. At present, there are more than 350,000 Chinese people serving as self-defense forces. Fourthly, in order to solve the problem of stabilizing the people's livelihood, I have devoted all my efforts to the fair distribution of essential goods and</p>
<p>Suppressing Prices: Shanghai has never had a household registration system. Therefore, at first, everyone generally said that it was impossible to implement a ration system based on tickets. However, after that, the price of rice soared day by day, and the people's livelihood was severely threatened. At that time, I felt that there was really no way to overcome this obstacle without implementing a ration system based on tickets. In the end, after overcoming all difficulties, I first conducted a census and implemented a ration system for rice, flour, and noodles based on tickets in June of last year. The results were very good. Thanks to the implementation of the ration system, the citizens in the concession, no matter who they were, could enjoy low-priced rice, flour, and noodles, and</p>
<p>Rationed Supply: The same steps will be taken for matches, soap, and cooking oil in the future, and preparations have been completed. Secondly, because the situation in Shanghai is special, a fixed price system is not adopted for price control, but efforts are focused on curbing profiteering and using all means, but price surges still cannot be suppressed, and I have failed. There are various reasons for this failure, but I do not want to explain them. I can only express my apology for what I cannot do. Finally, regarding financial issues, the Board of Works has had a revenue shortfall for more than ten years in a row. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the issuance of municipal bonds was impossible, and taxes were also in arrears. Therefore, it was necessary to endure significant sacrifices and strive to overcome this deficit. After the Board of Works was taken over by the Japanese side, if the Board of Works' funds were insufficient, the Japanese side would have to bear the burden. Therefore, in order to fill the deficit, measures such as reducing the salaries of employees, economizing on expenses, and abolishing non-urgent projects were implemented. At the same time, new tax sources such as retail donations and food and drink donations were also introduced. Fortunately, the citizens cooperated and fulfilled their tax obligations to the best of their ability. Therefore, by the end of last year, the deficit was finally made up, and there was actually a surplus.</p>
<p>This year's budget is 250 million yuan. It is expected that there will be no problems in the future this year, and sound finances can continue to be maintained. In this year's budget, the item of donation and tax revenue is listed as 166 million yuan, and the full amount has been collected before June. It is deeply believed that this sound financial situation will also make some contribution to Japan's completion of the Greater East Asia War. I hope that the Chinese side will understand Japan's true intentions and seek to promote the fair and smooth progress of municipal administration, so that the recovery of the Shanghai Concession can truly contribute to China's revitalization. Fortunately, Mayor Chen Gongbo is an expert in administration, so I can rest assured about this.</p>
<h3>Broadcaster Hirota's Observations on the Silence of the Eastern and Western Battlefields.</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Special Dispatch from this Port) Hirota, Chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy, stated at a reception for foreign reporters yesterday: General non-specialized military commentators interpret the military silence in the South Pacific and European battlefields as a sign of the weakening of the Axis powers. Such a judgment of the current war situation based on the First World War is a very serious mistake.</p>
<p>Changes in Military Strategy Over the Past Two Decades: In the two decades since the last war, military strategy and other world conditions have undergone tremendous changes. The above-mentioned critics and self-proclaimed military experts believe that the silence on the two battlefields is due to the Axis powers adopting a defensive posture and that since the Axis powers withdrew from Tunisia, the anti-Axis forces have gained a military advantage in Europe. As for the Pacific, they roughly believe that the silence of the Solomon Islands campaign and the results of the Aleutian Islands campaign are both signs that Japan is adopting a defensive posture. However, these critics are not aware of the fact that all conditions have changed since the last war and still use it as the basis for their judgment.</p>
<p>Arguments Based on One-Sided Views: Anti-Axis critics base their views on the relative area, manpower, and various resources of military importance of each country. American experts, who claim to be experts, also include geographical factors, emphasizing that the United States, Germany, and Italy are all separated by oceans. However, if they believe that the above-mentioned factors are decisive, then there is no basis to understand the victory of the Axis powers in this war. They do not understand why Japan, which may have been exhausted by the China Incident, has been able to engage in the Greater East Asia War and continuously win victories. They also do not understand how Germany and Italy have been able to occupy various points from Norway to the Soviet Union and the Balkans in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>Obsolete Theories Are Not Suitable for the Times: Today, those who attempt to analyze this war with obsolete and outdated theories are completely out of touch with the times. Even if the theories of these commentators are called correct, the latent combat power of the Axis powers is far from the weakness that they imagine. It must be known that Germany and Italy are both extremely wealthy in terms of material resources. In the past, they felt a lack of food and labor, but today there is a sufficient supply of both factors. Moreover, the industrial base of both countries is very solid. This situation is especially true for Germany. German leader Hitler has now completely controlled the domestic situation. Today, the German people, although suffering the same pain as in the last war, are determined to endure any hardship to win. As for the national spirit of Italy, it is completely different from that in the last war. Although it suffered losses in Tunisia, it feels no anxiety. In the Pacific, Japan has resources from the Indochinese countries to the South Pacific territories for its use, and its manpower is united and determined to fight. They can almost be called the only people in the world who can fight for their country and endure any hardship. Moreover, there are hundreds of millions of Asian people who understand Japan's goals and support and cooperate with it as its backing.</p>
<p>Decisive Victory with Wealth Is Insufficient: The particularity of the current war cannot be decided by numbers or outdated strategies. The trend of history is favorable to the Axis powers. The longer the war lasts, the greater the friction between the anti-Axis powers will be, and their decline will be even more severe. If, as the commentators say, the number of people and are decisive, then there is no reason why the anti-Axis powers cannot stop the Japanese from advancing south, and Japan has shattered the ABCD line without any difficulty. In Europe, Germany did not attack for six months after the start of the war, but once it launched an attack, it was like breaking bamboo, and it could not be stopped. Today, the silence on the two battlefields can be explained in the same way as the six months after the start of the war in Europe and before the outbreak of the war in East Asia.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Lantao, at the venerable age of seventy, strives to serve society. Last year, he suffered from illness due to overwork. His blood sugar has not yet recovered after his illness, but guests visit and entertain him in droves, which greatly affects his health. Therefore, on May 13th, his colleagues issued a small notice on his behalf to inform all sectors of society that he would decline evening banquets and visits for conversations. Now that the weather is gradually warming, in order to comply with Mr. Wen's intention to preserve his health, and with Mr. Wen's consent, from July 1st, all lunch banquets will also be declined. We respectfully inform Mr. Wen's relatives, friends, and old acquaintances that, out of concern for his well-being, please do not invite him to lunch banquets. We hope for your understanding.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Cemetery Relocation Extended to the End of July</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau previously received instructions from the municipal government, approving the letter from the Supervision Section of the Japanese Naval 武官府, requesting all tomb owners of the Shanghai Public Cemetery to relocate their graves automatically due to military necessity. It has repeatedly notified all tomb owners to complete the registration and relocation procedures at the bureau by the end of this month. It is now learned that there are still many tomb owners who are unable to come to relocate their graves due to travel issues. In consideration of the convenience of the tomb owners, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Naval 武官府 to extend the relocation period and has requested the municipal government to approve the extension to the end of July. It has been decided that no further extensions will be granted after that. From August 1st, if there are still tomb owners who have not registered with the bureau for relocation, the bureau will relocate the graves on their behalf and erect a marker for future identification.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama's Candid Views on Sino-Japanese Relations and Elucidation of the Meaning of Co-prosperity</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, attended a tea party hosted by Shen Bao yesterday and candidly shared his views on the past, present, and future of Sino-Japanese relations. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Importance of Returning Concessions: I previously met with Mr. Feng and mentioned that in the near future, Japan would return the concessions in China. After a year, I came to Shanghai and witnessed China's imminent restoration of its sovereignty and dignity of independence. My previous conjecture was not wrong, which is something that not only I personally, but also the 100 million Japanese people can be proud of. The return of the Shanghai concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality have extremely important significance, not only for China but also for the entire Greater East Asia. Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality, in Japan, extraterritoriality existed in the past, just as in China. At that time, we all deeply felt how humiliating this was for Japan. At present, the general Chinese people may not yet deeply understand this significance, but they will gradually feel the importance of this significance. Japan abolished extraterritoriality because Japan itself struggled hard to achieve it, and China also fervently hoped for it. However, I hope that everyone recognizes that the abolition of extraterritoriality is deeply related to the progress of the Greater East Asia War. Because China is vast and rich in resources, it has the conditions to become the world's strongest country, but the reason why it is bullied by countries around the world is due to the existence of extraterritoriality and foreign concessions within Chinese territory. But today, the extraterritoriality and the existence of concessions that shackle China's hands and feet have been completely lifted, allowing China to progress freely in the world.</p>
<p>Key Turning Point in Japanese Opinion: But here, from the standpoint of myself and the Japanese people, I express great annoyance. Because I have always criticized the existence of concessions and extraterritoriality in China, but when I asked Chinese people if Japan had concessions and extraterritoriality in China, no one answered "no," which is very regrettable. If there were a Chinese person here, they would certainly say, "If you criticize the behavior of the British, you can say the same to Japan. If you call Britain a pirate nation, then Japan is also a pirate." The annoyance I feel refers to this. Although Japan in the past oppressed China along with Britain, I am able to express very important opinions here. Apart from a few intellectuals in Japan, the rest have not yet realized this, and there is even less recognition in China. Because Japan had a public concession in Shanghai similar to that of Britain, and special concessions in Tianjin and other places. From this point of view, Japan and Britain were indeed the same. And at that time, the meaning of establishing concessions was also the same for Japan and Britain, seeking interests and privileges. However, Japan's interpretation of the constitutional meaning of concessions gradually changed, especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's understanding of the meaning of concessions and the meaning of British concessions underwent a 180-degree shift. When I say this, some people may think I am quibbling, but I believe that the Japanese intellectual class has a confident understanding of this, and soon historical facts will prove the truth of this statement. Japan has previously risked the nation's fate to go to war. At that time, Japan did have great ambitions, attempting to expand its national power and develop the ability to prevent being oppressed by other countries. Therefore, it took such actions. Japan, like Britain, Russia, Germany, and France, established foreign interests in Weihaiwei, Jiaozhou Bay, and other places. That is, it similarly set up interests on the mainland. This was nothing more than Japan seeking to realize its hope of transforming from an infant into an adult. Perhaps at that time, little Japan already had grand ambitions, fearing that not only in China, but also in India and Persia, it had dreams of turning them into its sphere of influence, but it did not have the means to realize it. Later, Japan transitioned from adolescence to adulthood, and when it turned its gaze towards China and saw that its coastal areas were all under the control of foreign interests, it felt that in this state, if China was destined to perish, could Japan survive?</p>
<p>Serious Concern for the Stability of East Asia: At this point, the young Japan fought and defeated Russia, and gradually gained confidence. Since then, Japan has become a stabilizing force in the Orient, and has to have serious concern about the stability of the Orient. Japan's responsibility is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, looking back at the state of the world, international transport is exceptionally developed, whether in terms of time or concepts. The distance between it and foreign countries is shortening every day. The situation in Europe and the Americas can immediately affect the Orient, and at the same time, the situation in the Orient can immediately affect Europe and the Americas, and international relations have become complex. At this time, Britain and the United States relied on their strength to oppress the countries of East Asia, aiming at the economic value of China, and extended their wide palms. Initially, the international communists from the north extended their wide hands, and Japan, China, and Manchuria all felt threatened by them. This has become a major concern for Japan and Korea. In addition, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's statement that "without Japan, there would be no Asia" gradually moved the minds of the Japanese people, causing the idea that China must have its own stabilizing force and that Japan must become a bulwark of Asia. Seven or eight years ago, when I went to North China, my predecessors said that Japan's policy towards China was also a policy towards Britain. This statement still deeply remains in my mind. In order to enhance its ability to conduct war, Japan had to rely on the supply of iron ore and coal from North China. At the same time, it had to establish Japanese influence in North China to prevent the spread of red forces.</p>
<p>Annoyance at Mutual Misunderstandings: Therefore, Japan sought to establish a special influence in North China. If there were no misunderstandings between China and Japan on this point, and if Chiang Kai-shek had no misunderstanding attitude, then Sino-Japanese relations could be fully understood. But the misunderstanding is not the responsibility of China alone, but both China and Japan have a responsibility. But at that time, in order to prevent the surging red forces, Japan was forced to implement its policies without obtaining full understanding from the Chinese government. At that time, Japan gradually became a mature man and became one of the leading countries in the world, capable of defeating any country in the world, but at this time, it created the existence of many enemies. This is because the European and American countries are all focused on China's economic value, and feel that Japan is their actual enemy. The stronger the ambitions of Europe and the United States towards China, the deeper Japan's worries. At this point, Japan re-examined the interests in China that it had agreed upon with Britain in the same way. After review, it came to the conclusion that Japan was in the same position as the European and American countries, and the more the aggression of Europe and the United States progressed, the deeper Japan's anxiety became. It keenly felt that Japan's policy towards China was not necessarily appropriate, but that the purpose of setting up special rights and interests in North China and within China was not to destroy China, but to resist European and American countries, and to avoid their poisonous hands. Therefore, if the purpose of the concessions of the European and American countries was to divide China, the idea of preventing them from doing so arose. Due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan completely eliminated the hostile British and American elements existing in China. Here, Japan must change its current position, because our rights and interests were in opposition to Britain and the United States. Therefore, today, the forces of Britain and the United States have been eliminated. If we follow in the footsteps of Britain and the United States and maintain their power, then it will be misunderstood that Japan harbors ulterior motives towards China. Now, Japan resolutely returns the concessions and abolishes extraterritoriality. In the hearts of the Japanese people, they feel extremely refreshed and can express that they have no ambitions whatsoever, and shake hands with the Chinese people in friendship. This is truly fortunate. In the future, the situation in China will rapidly improve, and Japan also hopes for this.</p>
<p>Gauging the General Views of Shanghai Residents: When I came to Shanghai this time, I asked Chinese people whether Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality was proper and whether they were happy about the return of the concessions. This question may seem strange to some people. Japan's return of the concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality are not aimed at obtaining any benefits, but are simply a matter of course. If the Chinese people in Shanghai do not welcome the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, then we would consider it a major matter. To put it bluntly, it is doubtful whether one can say that everyone in Shanghai welcomes the return of the concessions and that every Chinese person feels grateful for the abolition of extraterritoriality. If the people of Shanghai still expect the prosperity created by the British and Americans, then this may indicate that the people of Shanghai have already become slaves of the British and Americans. Japan hopes to even return the British and American interests that Japan has obtained to China, so that China can become stronger day by day. However, if some people in Shanghai do not express their welcome, what is the reason? It is because they believe that Japan is in a losing position in the war. If Japan fails, then the National Government's cooperation with Japan or Japan's concessions to it to recover the rights and interests of Britain and the United States will be a dangerous matter. If Japan fails and Chongqing and the British and Americans return to Shanghai, then cooperation with the National Government or Japan would feel dangerous. But I can assert that Japan, for its own sake, for the sake of Greater East Asia, for China, and even for the Philippines and for the whole of Asia, will surely win victory. If you ask why Japan is sure to win victory, I will present the following two points:</p>
<p>The Interests at Stake in a Protracted War: Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan was in a doomed position, bound by the British and Americans, just like the Chinese. But once it rose up and broke free from this chain and advanced south to New Guinea, Java, and Burma, Japan's sphere of influence expanded day by day, including the regions in the world richest in resources. This has strategically established a winning posture. Not only that, but even in a protracted war, it has established an invincible posture. If Japan maintains its current situation and develops resources such as iron ore, coal, tin, and rubber, then it will be better and better, whether it is for decades or centuries. The Japanese people are now tightening their belts and saving money, but when they look at the situation in various places in the south, they feel gratified in their hearts. To give an example, the oil produced in Sumatra is more than that obtained from Germany and Romania. In addition, there are iron ore, coal, and other things that the United States cannot obtain, such as rubber, tin, iron, and alumina. Regarding Japan's construction of the South, Australian Prime Minister Curtin once said: "Time is on Japan's side." But now, in a protracted war, the hope of victory is not on the side of the United States, but on the side of Japan. This is vastly different from the situation before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the day when it is able to successfully develop, then Japan is preparing to launch a second offensive, so before the completion of the construction program, it must ensure</p>

<h3>From "Relying on Parents" and "Relying on Friends" to "Filial Piety" and "Respect for Friends"</h3>
<p>— Da Nian</p>
<p>"At home, rely on parents; when away from home, rely on friends" are two well-known adages. Their original intention is simply to clarify that only parents truly love their children, so when children are by their parents' side, they always rely solely on them. When they grow up and step into society, loyal friends are also indispensable, because they can help people in times of need and help you accomplish what you cannot do on your own. However, it is regrettable that some people often refuse to use their brains even slightly to explore the true meaning of these two sentences. They simply memorize the single word "rely." "Rely" means "dependence," and the "parasites" of society are born from here! It goes without saying that "parasites" harm the country and society. Let us think about it from their own perspective. Who has ever seen one of them have a good end? Therefore, neither parents nor friends are completely unreliable, but one must recognize one's own position and standpoint, and not neglect one's own tasks. There are certainly parents who spoil their children without understanding, but who in the world does not love their children? And love has its variations, and blame has its degrees. Isn't it due to the children's worthiness or unworthiness? Making friends can be like "white heads as new," or "acquaintances at first meeting." Some are willing to "risk their lives for friendship," while some friends want to take advantage of you at every opportunity. Although choosing friends can be cautious or careless, your own "morality" and "behavior" are always the greatest forces driving the other party! Therefore, "Those who love others are always loved by others, and those who respect others are always respected by others." If you want to "rely on parents" and "rely on friends," shouldn't you first "rely on yourself?" Then, "filial piety to parents" and "respect for friends" are the unspoken meanings of the phrases "At home, rely on parents; when away from home, rely on friends!"</p>
<h3>Bitter Tea</h3>
<p>— Ji Wei Yi</p>
<p>Have you ever sipped a cup of bitter tea after a meal or drinking session?</p>
<p>I have a habit of drinking bitter tea.</p>
<p>I like to hold a mouthful of strong tea in my mouth, letting the bitter taste seep deeply into the root of my tongue.</p>
<p>It is not that I deliberately forsake sweetness and choose bitterness to gain praise from others. Who in the world does not love sweet things? However, the ultimate flavor in the world is only able to equal the poignant and refreshing nature of bitter tea.</p>
<p>Just as black is the combination of all colors, bitterness is the convergence of all flavors. Those frivolous men and women dressed in red and green do not know the nobility of black. Then, how can those gourmand friends who indulge in sweetness and fat appreciate the beauty of bitterness?</p>
<p>Whether you eat a piece of candy or bite into a piece of meat, its taste disappears as soon as you swallow it. Sometimes, eating too much can make your mouth feel sickeningly sweet. However, drinking bitter tea is never like this.</p>
<p>Did you feel a bit bitter and uncomfortable when you took a sip of bitter tea? Please be patient and swallow it slowly! Before long, you will feel a strange change taking place in your mouth. The bit of bitterness on the root of your tongue has transformed into a mouthfull of fragrance, and this fragrance carries an extremely clear and lasting sweetness. However, this is not a sweetness that can be compared to the sweetness of candy. This is a flavor that comes from bitterness. You think this flavor is good, right? However, without your initial endurance of the bitterness, where would this sweetness come from?</p>
<p>Friends, I tell you: "Eating bitter tea is like this, and being a person is no exception." Enduring some hardship and suffering a little in the present is precisely the foundation for future sweetness! Is that right?</p>
<h3>Pride</h3>
<p>— Nian Qi</p>
<p>We can often see that some people tend to become extremely arrogant because they have "achieved something occasionally" or "succeeded by luck," and they also display an attitude of "I am the only one who matters." In fact, pride does not indicate that a person has profound and great learning and cultivation. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of a person's lack of learning, lack of cultivation, and shallow insignificance.</p>
<p>Pride is like a trap. If one doesn't think about getting out of it soon after recognizing it, one might feel very pleased with oneself at the time, but later one will surely feel one's past mistakes and deeply regret them.</p>
<p>Solomon said: "Pride is the precursor to destruction; the day of the downfall of a person with an arrogant will is not far off." Once a person has contracted the bad habit of pride, they will never be willing to conduct further research. So how can they not be eliminated by the times?</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Talking About Ultraviolet Rays</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shi</p>
<p>The term "ultraviolet rays" is now widely heard by the general public. What exactly is this light? What is its source? What are its uses? These may not yet be clear to the general public. Now, I will give a simple explanation of these points.</p>
<p>In the three words "ultraviolet rays," the meaning of the word "ultra" indicates that this light is beyond our vision. In other words, it is invisible to the naked eye. The reason why this violet light (or rays) is invisible to the naked eye is because its wavelength (that is, the length of the light wave) is too short to be reflected into the eye.</p>
<p>The sources of ultraviolet rays are two types: natural and artificial. The natural source is sunlight. Primitive humans had no houses to live in and were under the sun all day long, absorbing plenty of ultraviolet rays, so their skin was rough and dark, and their physique was strong. Later, as civilization gradually developed, people built houses and lived indoors, receiving less sunlight, resulting in pale skin, weak physique, and susceptibility to disease. Although sunlight can penetrate through windows, the ultraviolet rays in sunlight cannot pass through ordinary glass because their wavelength is too short, so people living indoors cannot enjoy the benefits of ultraviolet rays. As for the artificial sources of ultraviolet rays, there are carbon arc lamps, mercury arc lamps, and special electric lamps with tungsten filaments inside. However, they are never as abundant and economical as sunlight.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays can increase the amount of vitamin D (commonly known as vitamin) contained in food. Therefore, the vitamin D content of milk, butter, and cereals increases after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays. Rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D, so ultraviolet radiation can be used to treat it. In order for teeth to be strong, in addition to containing abundant calcium and phosphorus in the diet, there must also be sufficient vitamin D. We know that cod liver oil is the richest source of vitamin D, but after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays, its strengthening power can be increased several times. Ultraviolet rays also have bactericidal power, so people suffering from tuberculosis and skin diseases often recover after being irradiated with ultraviolet rays. In addition to its functions in medical treatment and hygiene, ultraviolet rays are also useful in scientific experiments, photography, and industry.</p>
<p>From the above, we know that we must have plenty of ultraviolet rays. Most residents in cities spend most of their time living indoors, and ordinary glass windows do not allow ultraviolet rays to pass through, so they cannot enjoy the benefits of this light, which affects their health, which is truly regrettable. Installing special glass windows that allow ultraviolet rays to pass through is certainly a good thing, but they are expensive and beyond the means of the average person. Therefore, the most economical and practical way is to spend more time outdoors so as to fully absorb ultraviolet rays.</p>
<h3>Collection of White Reeds</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Meng Lei</p>
<p>Don't only pick smart things to do, otherwise who in the world will do the stupid things?</p>
<p>Lack of concentration is a person's fatal flaw, and working without a plan is a waste of life.</p>
<p>What truly makes people strive to do well is not others' "praise" and "encouragement," but rather some "sarcasm," "ridicule," and some "harsh words." I think so.</p>
<p>Without opposition, there is no progress; without contradictions, how can there be development? We all live in contradictions: attraction and rebuttal, reason and emotion, love and hate... These are necessary for human survival and social progress.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>One late autumn evening, the gentle sun slowly hid below the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky, and the entire sky was filled with sunset glow. Although this sunset glow was not as beautiful and lovely as that in late spring, the farmers, after a day of hard work, removed their work clothes and looked up, which was enough to comfort their hearts and recover their fatigue. After all, it was a gift of consolation given to people by nature!</p>
<p>"Dad! Don't do it anymore! Rest!" A girl about eleven or twelve years old—Xiu Bao—was calling the few hens that she had raised with one hand, beak…beak…beak, and was driving them to the wooden shed to rest, while seeing her father with a sickle in his hand, still wanted to go to work. She couldn't bear to see her dad working so hard. Then she said:</p>
<p>"It's getting dark, and being busy all day has been tiring enough. Isn't it okay to do it tomorrow? Dad, take a break!"</p>
<p>"Xiu Bao, you don't know, tomorrow has its own things to do. The reeds in the ditch by the house are about to wither. I want to cut them, dry them in the sun, and use them as firewood for a few days. Firewood is very expensive now, and we can't not plan for it. I'll be right back. Be a good girl and drive the chickens away, then tidy up and prepare dinner," Xiu Bao's father—A Kun, who was nearly fifty years old, had spent his life in the fields, and he looked even older and more worn out this year. While saying this, he took heavy steps and walked towards the ditch not far from the house, went barefoot, rolled up his trousers, stood in the already chilly water, picked up the sickle, and cut the drooping reeds.</p>
<p>"No! I won't! These few chickens are laying eggs. The oil for our family…it all depends on trading them for it. No! No!...I won't!" A Kun was cutting the reeds with a whoosh sound when he suddenly heard his daughter's crying from the house, and at the same time, the hen's clucking and struggling sounds.</p>
<p>"What's wrong! Weren't you just happily calling the chickens to the shed? Could someone be here to take the chickens?" A Kun stopped the sickle in his hand, thinking like this: "Oh! That's not good! Didn't I hear someone say that the old man in the ×× team likes to eat chicken and eggs the most, and often goes to the countryside to take them away regardless of whether they are willing or not. This morning, I went to town to buy oil and heard that something called '…Provincial Maritime ×× Commander×'s team headquarters' had arrived in our town. This time, the bad luck is going to fall on my head." Thinking of this, A Kun pushed the reeds aside with his sickle and poked his head to look at the house. Sure enough, he saw a fellow wearing gray cloth clothes, wearing a soft flat-topped hat, and tying leggings, was chasing the chickens. Looking at him, this fellow was just a big child of fourteen or fifteen years old. How could he be so bold?</p>
<p>"I won't allow it! Our family relies on these few chickens to live on. If you want to eat them, then eat our lives. Please spare us, sir!" A Kun couldn't help but jump up in the water and shout. (One)</p>
