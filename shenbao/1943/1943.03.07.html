<p>社評</p>
<h3>調整機實現簡政</h3>
<p>國府參戰以來，為配合參戰後的實際需要起見，政治機構，已經逐漸實施合理的調整，所以國人對於政治前途，寄予極大的期望。不過，我們更希望政府貫澈「簡政」的要求，為此特就所見，獻議如次：</p>
<p>首先，中央機構與地方機構之關係，似乎應該求其更密的聯繫。地方政府與中央政府，原屬一體，地方業務，除財政稅收必須統一處理以外，盡可由地方政府辦理之，不必由中央部會直接去辦。又除主計系統，事　超然以外，也不必另有超然一系的額外組織。前者例如農場，林場，農事試驗場，社會服務機關之類，如由地方政府或私人團體辦理，而政府處於協助指導地位，其效果必較中央去辦為大，一切流弊也易於防止。後者如合作行政之類，也不必有類似超然的組織。我們希望限制中央機關直接在省區辦理業務，如研究結果，認為某些業務須由國家經營，亦盡可分別由地方政府其責任，不必由中央部會直接舉辦。</p>
<p>其次，為了貫澈簡政，對於中央與地方機關的數量，須加以檢討與調整。過去我國政治上常有一種現象，以為中央與地方機關的數量完全一致，中央有此一機關，地方亦必有同一機構，上下相承。例如中央有某某部，省必有某某廳或處，縣必有某某科，不僅無謂，亦日官勞民病，常由此而起。現在這種政治風習，已不普遍，但也不能說絕對不再存在，似乎也應加以注意：原則上，中央與地方盡可分開，而且因設計，指導以及實施國策之必要，也非分開不可，一到地方則情勢較簡，以合而為一較宜。</p>
<p>再次，有若干機關，當日設立，原屬一時權宜，吉過境遷，不必繼續。還有些機關，實際上無事可作，只為無此即感缺陷而設　，更應撤廢。至於性質相近事務不繁的，應該合併，所有這些，都是為了節省國帑，簡化行政。如其人才可用，儘可調往適當機關任職。我們希望這種簡政的措施，貫澈於中央並及於地方。</p>
<p>此外，國營業務的範圍，應該迅即確定。年來國營業務，已日益加多，今後為中日協定之實踐，敵產與租界之移交等，結果，國營範圍必更擴展，大之如對外貿易，交通運輸，小之如慈善救濟，都會發生孰為國營，孰為民營的問題。我們以為國家人力財力有一定的限定，而這些小的國營事業，直隸中央，或遠在千百裡外，監察指揮的不可能，流弊不免滋生，而貽地方與人民以不良的影響。所以，應該澈底考慮國營業務的範圍，凡業務微末或事屬人民團體可以辦理的，如社會　務，社會福利事業之類，國家儘可居輔導地位，即若干工商農墾及補助性的交通運輸事業，也不必事事由國家直接經營，旣免「與民爭利」之嫌，又收「簡政」之效，而民力之利用也可於此實現了。</p>

<h3>決戰下的科學研究</h3>
<p>戰事的進行，日趨激烈，而變成了消耗戰。我們在物的戰力之數量上，不及敵人，在質素上不能不勝過敵人，戰爭科學上的大發明，其有利並不比在作戰中獲得一次勝利為低，所以從其效果上說來，科學研究者的責任，的確很為重大。</p>
<p>近時日本科學者的非常努力，在多方面成就了值得注意的結果，殊堪欣喜。然而在時局的要求上，是否眞已經完全發揮了總力的能率了嗎？依我們看來，在目前決戰時期下，感覺到在科學研究上，高度能率的發揮尚未達到最大限度的利用。</p>
<p>任何人承認科學在增強戰力上是很重要的抽象的原則，所以在現實上，所有妨害增進能率的原因，不能不予以充分的解決。即在為政者方面，在科學者方面，都存在着促進其應各自反省的事項。</p>
<p>首先，在為政者方面，最的事項之一，為科學研究家之人的問題。一切事業都是人做的，但人的比重像在科學研究中具有這樣重大的影響者很少。幹練有才能的指導者，如欲實現其特殊的創意，非得有挺身於研究實騐的共同研究者及助手不可；更非得有新進富於朝氣之士，如手足之輔，作為忠實的研究　手不可。科學研究與戰爭同樣，任其怎樣能幹，僅有部隊長是不行的。</p>
<p>其二，科學研究者，應使其埋首於研究的時間中，本來，在日本的大學敎授中，有才能的科學研究者很多。但近來自學科與　部增設之後，因人才的缺乏，兼課與強化學務的繁忙，又因學校雜務的日趨增加，並忙於各種委員會的時常開會，的確費掉了很多的時間。須知道眞正有效能的科學成績，多產生於研究實騐室，故有為的研究者所擔任的研究外的瑣事，應加調整。這一點，我們切望敎育部當局在學制施策中慎加考慮。</p>
<p>基三，對於科學研究之物的援助，即物與錢的問題。在目前，科學研究中必需物件的備置，在可能範圍內，應與以幫助。並且近年來大學都承認在研究中金錢是必需的，現在是非錢不可的時代。</p>
<p>以上是促醒為政者對科學研究的本體應重加認識。在他方面，對科學家，切望其率直反省之點亦不少。科學家應切實認淸，何者為目前國家所切需的科學問題，應從事研究的。而且各研究者的專門分野，其能力的程度，在科學家們中間最為淸楚，故應由科學家們自己斟酌決定研究的分擔範圍，嚴戒其延展到多方面不必要的部分。同時，所謂專門當然是很狹隘的，假便解釋為末稍的，因而忽視根本的理論技術，使不能發揮有為的才能，這可以說是國家的不經濟。關於特別重要的問題，組織專門委員會的時候，不能不充分考慮此點。</p>
<p>而且在決戰時期下，為促進科學研究的成功，避免不必要的重複，研究同一問題的科學家們，應互相聯絡，時常通知其進行的程度，互相同心協力，孜孜研究。</p>
<p>這些都是老生常談，且易於實行，但如不復故態，則實行起來決不順利。關係者應認識時局的重大性，滅私奉公，以前綫將士的心為心，為貫澈國家的目的而苦鬥，如此才能發揮最高度的能率。（翔：譯自二月二十七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>蘇聯戰鬬力全貌</h3>
<p>— 布施勝治著</p>
<p>德國宣傳部長戈培爾，二月十八日在柏林　白地吿訴全世界說：</p>
<p>「蘇維埃政府的巧妙的掩飾，使德軍錯估了布爾雪維克的戰力，現在我們方才知道蘇聯戰力的全貌及其所以龐大的緣由。」</p>
<p>蓋蘇聯為最善於掩飾，最精於防諜的國家。第一，蘇聯實施國內旅券制度；第二，蘇聯有秘密警察的組織；第三，蘇聯是所謂「閉鎖的國家。」</p>
<p>國內旅券制度，自帝俄時代即已實施，至蘇維埃時代更加以強化。人民沒有一紙旅券，即一日不能生活。敵人的第五縱隊之所以不能進入蘇聯者，第一因為有國內旅券制度的存在。</p>
<p>秘密警察對外是諜報的急先鋒，對內是諜報的鐵壁，蘇聯因為在「資本主義國家　的包圍中」，所以秘密警察的任務對一切國家都加以嚴密警戒，對於內外的敵人，用銳利的目光窺伺着。</p>
<p>同樣，蘇聯又因為是「白色世界中唯一的赤色國家」，所以嚴守極端的鎖國政策。外國人的入國，加以極度的限制，對於極少數允許入國的外國人，秘密警察常追隨左右，不使其明瞭國內的　情。如此，蘇聯遂成為「閉鎖的國家」，在防諜上至為　利，同時，我們不能不牢記蘇聯又為諜報最巧妙的國家。</p>
<p>蘇聯利用此便於防諜的立場，常隱秘其實力，使敵國忽略。在前年十一月七日第廿四次革命紀念日，陪都庫比希夫舉行戰時閱兵式，前國防人民委員長蘇聯巨頭之一，伏洛希洛夫元帥自閱兵，各國使臣，武官，對此閱兵式極感興味，但所檢閱的軍隊衹有三師團，且大部分系徒步部隊，武器的形式旣微細，人種也參差不一。之後，極械化部隊出來了，所見的只是在糧秣車上用銅鐵絲曳引着迫擊砲和機槍，國內戰爭中用的小型坦克，和用農事載重牽引的舊式野砲，這就算是機械化部隊了，居然在蓮瑪拉廣場，展覽於外交團之前。</p>
<p>蘇聯向來每年舉行閱兵式二次，（五月一日勞動紀念日與十一月七日革命紀念日），利用此作為向列國誇耀武備的機會。實施五年計劃的最初數年間，蘇聯每次都拿出所有的新式武器，在空中有重轟炸機大編隊飛行於天空，在地上則有無數輕重戰車隊轟然駛行，在赤色廣場上，耀武揚威。</p>
<p>蘇聯為何要這樣做呢。要之蘇聯在五年計劃完成之前，無論如何不能不避免戰爭，所以故意誇紅軍完善的裝備，使列強不敢昧然攻擊蘇聯，然而前年十一月庫比希夫的閱兵式，完全相反，故意顯示未訓練的預備軍和舊式大砲，使人家見後以為蘇聯的預備軍是這樣的訓練未純熟，蘇聯軍隊的配備是這樣的粗陋，因而冬季的大反攻是不必提起的……蘇聯用這巧妙的掩飾方法，一面恐嚇英美，假使不加緊供給武器，開闢第二戰綫，則紅軍即將被德軍擊潰。這是何等巧妙的掩飾方法啊！</p>
<p>此次第二次冬季反攻中，蘇聯出動了龐大的預備隊上前綫，其兵力遠超於軸心國軍隊之上，即德軍當局亦予以承認。開戰以來，紅軍的損失，至為重大，死傷與俘虜合計在千數百萬以上。所以在第二次冬季反攻中出現於前綫的紅軍，大部分系新編的預備隊。可是蘇聯如此龐大的生力預備軍，在何處編制，從何處而來的呢！</p>
<p>前年第一次夏季戰役中，紅軍的敗退吿一段落時，當時紅軍的北方正面軍懷念官伏洛希洛夫，南方正面軍司令官波琴努伊兩元帥，突然從前綫調至後方，當時世人多以為兩元帥因負敗北之責而退至預備役，但事實則不然，他們受了史太林所囑托的「編制與訓練未來的冬季反攻中大規模的預備隊」重大使命，而退人烏拉爾的山間。</p>
<p>史太林何以選中這二元帥付託以紅軍捲土重來的準備呢？這有很感興趣的歷史緣由。十月革命的初年，東有庫爾茨克，南有台尼金，西有優台尼基三大將所牽領的反革命軍一時蠭起。尤以台尼金庫以破竹之勢北進，其先鋒瑪蒙托夫騎兵團早已到達莫斯科南方的庫爾斯克，蘇聯政府在一九一九年秋敗北的末路中，為挽回頹勢計，乃企圖編制赤色騎兵團以對抗瑪蒙托夫的騎兵團，特拔擢伏洛希洛夫及波琴努伊二人以當此危局。新編制的第一赤色騎兵團，以伏洛希洛夫為政治委員，波琴努伊為司令官，實施勇猛的反攻，所至披靡，而蘇維埃政府之危局遂獲解救，伏洛希洛夫及波琴努伊二人自那時起即有「敗績中編製預備隊的專門家」之稱。</p>
<p>第一次夏季攻勢中　軍的猛攻，其勢至為驟急。尤以布克元帥率領之中央軍先鋒，業已迫近莫斯科的西南郊，在此危急存亡之秋，史太林忽然想起一九一九年當時的危機，同時想起了用伏洛希洛夫與波琴努伊二人在敗績中編制預備隊。</p>
<p>前年秋季以來，在烏拉爾的山間，與伏爾伽何的上游，蘇聯從全國召集了近千萬的壯丁，在伏洛希洛夫與波琴努伊二元帥的指導下，編製預備隊，開始訓練，企圖在第二次冬季戰爭中開始大反攻。果然在去年十一月十九日，第二次冬季反攻開始的時候，伏洛希洛夫元帥重又出現於前綫。第一次冬季反攻，由丁莫生柯元帥與契柯夫大將合作。此次的第二次冬季反攻，丁莫生柯離開前綫（據傳派遺到美國），由伏洛希洛夫及契柯夫二元帥指揮反攻。契柯夫盡其第一次冬季反攻的經　，伏洛希洛夫則用自己編制，訓練的預備隊，展開第二次冬季大反攻。</p>
<p>波琴努伊元帥的東山再起，尚無確報，但他所編練的騎兵團今正在蘇聯南部作戰。　預備隊的編制，德軍方面無從探悉，蓋系過去一年間在烏拉爾山中秘密訓練而編成的。</p>
<p>烏拉爾山與伏爾加河上游為編制預備隊的基地，已如上述。同時該地亦為紅軍的兵工廠，擔任重大的任務，故値得加以一提。今冬的德蘇戰場，與去冬不同，二軍都出動相當多數的戰車，故戰况至為劇烈。今冬的氣候較去冬為高，耐寒飛機與耐寒戰車亦正費相當工夫加以研究。然而蘇聯的飛機與戰車因英美的補充已挽回頹勢。本年冬季出現南蘇戰場的英美製成戰車，為數甚多，紅軍的裝置，仍以自製者為主，亦系事實。</p>
<p>蘇聯在德蘇開戰的第一年，烏克蘭的西半部被奪，第二年東半部又失陷，蘇聯最大工業根據地烏克蘭全部遂渝於德手。致其工業生產力激减，故戰車與飛機的補充唯有賴於英美的援助。然而在本年冬季的反攻中，蘇聯集結了可驚大兵力於前綫，同時，自製的戰車，最新式兵器，源源不絕的輸送至前綫。因為業已失陷的烏克蘭的工業，由於烏拉爾工業的飛躍的增產而得以替代了。</p>
<p>烏拉爾工業地帶，在去年年頭，史太林聲稱武器的製造量將「增加至前年度的二倍乃至三倍」。今年初頭更堅決表明須「增加至前年的二倍」。烏拉爾的工業，早已在戰時的動員狀態中，所以其生產能率當然發展至最大限度。果然在第二第三年度有正如預期的可驚的增產。那麼烏拉爾的工業怎樣能有如此可驚的增產呢？當然，如僅就烏拉爾原有的工業能力的增進，決不能有這樣大的增產。烏拉爾工業的生產，不外於烏克蘭工業巧妙地遷至的結果。</p>
<p>蘇維埃政府早已慮到德蘇一旦開戰，烏克蘭即萬戰場，此方面的工業決不可恃，故進行五年計劃的時候，即準備於烏拉爾建設第二工業根據地，這就是烏拉爾所蘊藏的豐富鐵鑛，與中部西比利亞的庫茨納茲的石炭結合而成為有名的烏拉爾庫茨納茲大綜合工業。</p>
<p>烏拉爾工業的中心地為斯夫愛爾特洛夫斯克，契裡阿平斯克，瑪可尼特果爾斯克等。在這些都市中所建設的工廠，規模宏大。德蘇開戰之後，德軍迫近烏克蘭時，哈里哥夫，斯達林格勒，伏希洛夫等地的工廠，其機器早已取出，裝配於烏拉爾各地的工場內，克萊姆林在烏克蘭的工業向烏拉爾的移轉中，發揮了可驚的手腕。烏拉爾自得到了烏克蘭方面許多機械的增援之後，其生產力勢必激增。今年初次烏拉爾工業的「二倍增產的誓約」，不能單視為蘇聯方面的宣傳。（翔：譯自二月二十八日·三月一日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>戰時經濟苦悶中的英帝國（上）</h3>
<p>— 龍飛</p>
<p>（一）軍需增產的緩遲</p>
<p>英國之戰時經濟，自一九三六年以後，即已施行軍需工業統制法，不過英國政府眞正實施總動員態勢，還是最近的事，例如和平產業轉向軍需產衆，在開戰當初，還只有對原料的分配有了限制而已，主姿的只是促其自動的由和平產業轉向軍需產業。當然，這種寬緩的措置，是不合戰爭的需要的，所以到了前年；一九四一年，就也不得不採取組織的政策，發動國家的强制權，使不急要的及和平時的產業，轉同軍需工業，實行勞動總動員。</p>
<p>英國首相邱吉爾曾經說明英國戰時生產的三個階段，說戰爭第二年是『非常少』的階段，第三年是『很多』的階段，第四年是「從心所欲」的階段。</p>
<p>然而，自從歐戰開始以來，英國已經渡過了戰爭的第四年，而英國重新整頓軍備也已滿了五年，而其生產狀况還沒有達到『從心所欲』的階段，即是『很多』階段的程度是否已經達到，也還是一個疑問哩</p>
<p>德國航空部長戈林呼喊：『大砲重於牛油』是一九三六年的事。當時英國對於德意志的「貧窮」，有着絕對的優感越。</p>
<p>正因爲英國有了這種優越感，使她的戰時生產機搆的確立無形中蹉跎了。這種蹉跎儘管英國後來怎樣的努力，英國的戰時生產體制，終有無可挽救的落後性，雖合英國本國及其自治領，還不能趕上和超出德國的軍需生產力。</p>
<p>從飛機來看，爲了整備的落後，現有第一綫的飛機不過一萬架，據最近的美國雜誌所載，飛機的每月的產額，德國的有三千架，而英國只有二千四百架，即僅達德國產量的五分之四·當然，如合英美兩國的產額，也許可以超過軸心國的生產量，但如以英國一國而言，連美國雜誌也說是追不上德國的。所以，英國的飛機生產量，大的只及德國康量的百分之八十。</p>
<p>再有造船，英國海軍當局最近成爲了造船計劃的成績不好而悲嗚。英國造船所的大戰以來，忙於商船之改裝軍艦及修理，化去了造船能力的半數，顯著地阻止了新造船舶的計劃。英國最近依獎國利巴第型貨給確定了一萬一千七百噸級的標準船舶的建造計劃，自安定龍骨至竣工，其工程預定爲六個月較之美國利第巴船裝造過程之平均爲二個月上下，其時間之長，自不及美國遠甚。而開戰以來的喪失都很重大。</p>
<p>（附表一）英國開戰以來船舶喪失數</p>
<p>—依據英海軍部發表—，英國動員了英國勞工大臣罪裴文氏會稱，過去十五年間，從事造船的全部職工，努力擴大造船能力，故近年來在德國空軍的轟炸之下，要求急激增產是不容易的。戰前英國的造船能力爲每月約三，四十萬噸，最近大體上爲五，六十萬噸，對於正在增加的需要，自不能充分。</p>
<p>（二）勞働力不足的深刻化</p>
<p>一般的說，英國的命運是和船舶密切連繫着的。英國戰時經濟，確實因爲船舶喪失之增加而處於非常的困難狀態，然而，其影響不大於船舶不足的，而將成爲英國抗戰經濟之危險信號的，還有勞働力不足之深刻化這個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>英國勞働力不足，並不是最近新發生的問題。不過是到了最近，才發展到了深刻不安的階段。但看一九四二年六月二十八日英國勞工大臣裴文氏在利物沛發表的談話，就可證明。他說：「英國從軍需工業以外的產業部門中抽撥大量的勞働力，而現在又得從軍需工業中征募靑年少年調遣到戰塲去，全部產業方面却得有大規模徵募的覺悟，軍需工業方面，勢將以女子從業員補充了」</p>
<p>第二次歐洲戰爭爆發以來，英國由於戰敗，就盡力於兵力的補充與增强，但自大東亞戰爭爆發以後，戰塲擴大到東亞一帶，爲了這個新的形勢，英國又不得不在西亞和埃及動員多數的兵力，英國之勞力源泉的遭受急激的壓迫，自然容易想象的了。不過，這與　了的兵員，爲着戰敗而受到士量的損失，結果所受軸心國的威脅日益增加，因此又不能不動員更多的兵力以爲補充，而英國的人口不過四千萬人，貧弱的勞働力源泉之迫於涸竭，自屬當然。但是，仍如裴文勞工大臣所述，最値得注目的是軍需工塲勞働者的大量動員。</p>
<p>勞工大臣裴文於利物浦演說之後不久，即於一九四二年七月八日發表爲補國內勞働力不足，決定提高微用婦女之年齡至四十五歲，首於七月十一日徵發一九〇〇年中生的婦女·裴文於去年五日二十一日在下院宜述英國勞働力不足已達普遍深刻階段，更可明瞭勞働力不足的程度。他說自十四歲至五十五歲的英國國民三千三百萬中，巳有二千二百萬以上被動員在軍隊，民間防衛及軍事關係生產部門裏去了，而軍事關係活動的人口，已佔全人口的三分之二，可謂打破世界的紀錄了。又據去年五月財政部長伍德氏發表，政府已爲徴用銀行，交易所，保險公司的從業員，特設委員會以求最大限度的微用，也可以從側面看出英國勞働力不足之深刻化。</p>
<p>爲了集中勞働力於　需產業，掘煤工人，棉業及羊毛產業工人就有非常缺乏的現象，結果煤的產量激减而軍需必要的棉製品也極其不足，又不得不從軍需工業中抽撥出相當　勞工到煤及棉的營業餘　去。這樣，不僅極度地壓迫非軍需產業，並且打破了適應軍事必要的界限，造成了勞働力的極大恐慌，引起了政治上和經濟上的危機。而不合理地利用婦女及童工，以及勞働時間的延長，自爲不可避免的了。</p>
<p>婦女勞働力的動員，依據一九四二年十二月十九日的勅令而普遍地實施，現在英國飛機工廠從業員的二分之二是女子，而彈藥工廠從業員三萬人中，百分之九十也是女子。但是，徵用婦女的年齡，一九四一年四月爲二十五歲以下，一九四二年三月擴至三十歲，七月更提高到四十五歲。又據一九四一年十二月二十三日的緊急法令，政府決定許可使用十五歲以下的少年工人，並許可每週勞働時間延增至五十二小時。不用說，這種勞働力之不足，勢必促進英國的危機。</p>
<p>英國產業與勞働力的統制，由戰時生產部及勞工部作二元的執行，由於與軍需有關各部間的互爭優先，由於一方面資本家在政治上的强固的地位，和工會至今尙有團體交涉權，握有罷工權而也有不可忽視的勢力，山於自由主義舊體制的這種矛盾還沒有淸除，結果，英國的產業動員就不能完善達成。　（未完）</p>

<h3>重慶籌集戰債的困難</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>發行數量過鉅不能消化　促成通貨膨脹之惡循環</p>
<p>重慶政權年來發行之戰時公債，數額殊足驚人，至三十一年七月止，發行公債名稱，有十二種之多。總數爲一百餘萬萬元。三十一年度開始，戰時公債勸募委員會所勸募者，尙爲二十九年度之建設金公債及軍需公債。該會所公布三十年度勸募所得之數，國內各省市已認募額共爲四萬萬三千八百六十七萬餘元，已報收數共爲一萬萬五千七百一十六萬餘元。按二十九年度公債發行總額，達十九萬萬七千四百萬元，今各地已認募數，僅爲發行總數五分之一强，若更以其已報收數而論，則尙不及發行總額十分之一。月歷年所發戰債，實際上印成債票，向公衆發售而在市面流行者，僅救國公債及國防公債金公債等三種。即此三種債券，不失之不普遍流通，即失之偏於沿海一偶，因是公債推銷旣屬有限，而需款孔急，兼以印刷困難，故大多數公債，皆用「總預約券」方式交與四行，作爲擔保；再由四行放款政府，而收取七釐利利利息，但銀行資力有限，其不能消化之大部份（約百分之七十以上），惟發行新鈔，以應政府墊借。故公債發行而後，因係自由購買制度，旣不能眞正做到「有錢出錢」之地步，又不能大量推銷以吸收游資。</p>
<p>戰時支用浩繁，增發鈔票，乃爲不可避免之籌款方式；惟增發鈔票，政府戰費大量支出，社會上之購買力亦當隨之大爲膨脹。故戰時財政之重要措施，即在如何收縮此不可避免之購買力膨脹。微之戰後英美各國，莫不皆然。惟收縮社會購買力之最有效方策，厥爲戰債之發行。而戰債發行在上述情形下，因戰債不能消化之影響，不僅對收縮購買力之大前提毫無補益，反而在戰債之烟幕下，走上通貨膨脹之惡循環。重慶過去公債政策，即墮於此項迷途之中，故其結果，在負擔上爲不公平，在時間上不易持久，在方法尤不能謂爲穩健，終至通貨增發，游資充斥，物價高漲，生產事業衰退，社會收益分配劇變。茲冉分節述之於後：</p>
<p>（一）通貨增發自法幣政策施行後，現銀已不復流通，一切交易均以法幣爲本，「七七」事變時，法幣發行額僅爲十四萬萬四千餘萬元，以中國地域之廣大，人口之衆多，供應尙或不敷，自未起過通貨之需要量。待戰事發生以後，戰費支用浩繁，財政需款，陡形膨脹，又以平時租稅制度未稱健全，增稅籌款，收效不多，故輕便之法，，惟訴諸募債發鈔兩途，發鈔逾限，因爲直接促成通貨膨脹，而公債政策，因社會不能消化，致未使增發之鈔票回籠，且反爲變形之增發新鈔，更促使通貨走入膨脹之途，以致滙價暴漲，物價暴漲，而通貨增發逾量時之所有徵兆，均顯現於經濟現象之中，惟現時通貨流通量之確實數字，因政府未予公布，無從揣知，僅厲德寅氏在五月七日重慶大公報發表之通貨物資與物價一文，根據三十二家銀行之記戰，作一粗略之佔計，求得三十年度通貨流通量指數較戰前約高十二倍，即三十年度通貨流通量約爲一百七十二萬萬餘元。</p>
<p>（二）游資充斥通貨旣經龐大增發，一社會購買力因之膨脹，而又以五年來戰債籌募，未得其法，增發之鈔票未能回籠，社會之購買力未能收縮，故游資充斥，實爲必然之結果。據私人估計，此項游資，約計國幣五十萬萬餘元，誠堪驚人。惟游資充斥之結果，投機盛行，物價暴漲，且動搖外滙，搗亂金融，阻碍生產，爲害莫大。</p>
<p>（三）物價高漲通貨增發，幣値日跌，物價遂成反比例而上漲，雖物價上漲，並不完全爲幣値下跌之結果，如戰時交通困難，物資缺乏，及投機盛行等因素，亦與之直接間接，發中影響，然終以幣値之跌落爲其主要因素。除二十七年四川等地，糧食價格會一底跌至戰前水準以下外，全國各地各物價格均爲上漲，且上漲之高，得未曾有。昆明漲價最高，西寗漲勢最低，亦至戰前數倍，共餘各城市平均物價均爲戰前三十至四十倍左右。戰時物價增漲之高實不可漠然視之。</p>
<p>（四）生產事業衰退因游資充斥，全國金融陷於不穩定狀態，蓋游資爲保存其游離之活力起見，多以半戀態之方式，活期或短期存款於銀行，故游資滙聚時，則則則使金融市塲頭寸過多，發生金融充血症；而游資逃亡時，則使金融市塲頭寸頓减，發生貧血症，週轉不靈，恐慌頓起，故現行銀行均不敢作比較長期之生產投資。且因遭受戰事之影響，銀行家一「戒懼恐慌」之心理特別濃厚，不易尋獲相當滿意妥實之生產投資對象。更以商業贏利特高，乃相率而營商業之投資。且即有少數之工業資金流入，亦多以囤積原料之姿態以營臨時之商業行爲。故眞正從事於生產事業之發展者，除少數國營機構外，殊不多覯。</p>
<p>（五）社會收益分配之劇變幣値日益下下落，物價長期上漲，囤積投機之風，如火如荼，致戰前戰後社會各階級之收益分配，大爲逕庭，即在戰前富者或已變窮，而戰前貧者或已變富，滄海桑田，良多感慨。谷春帆氏在十一月二日桂林大公報發表戰費負擔與收益分配之億測一文，對於此點，叙述甚詳，大致有謂。</p>
<p>因爲物價增漲之故，社會上一小部分人（約百分之十四，按指商人囤積原料之工業家及地主）其收益大爲增加，在戰前彼等收入，爲全社會收益百分之十四，而現在則爲百分之四十。</p>
<p>其他一部分人（約佔百分之八十六。按指富　，中農，貧農，佃農，薪水階級及其他固定收入者），其收益本爲全社會百分之八十六，今减爲百分之六十。</p>
<p>此項結論，旣爲臆測，自不免有粗疏之譏，惟徵之今日之事實，則大致當無可疑之處。是物價增漲之結果，貧富懸殊，貧愈貧而常愈富。都會之柏油馬路上，左手挾少女，右手挾黄金龍之翩翩公子，隨時可見，而小街僻巷中之塞無衣飢無食者，又累累皆是。此實爲戰時經濟現象中之畸形病態，長此以往，自必貽害無窮。（三十二年一月十日寄）</p>

<p>當局意見</p>
<p>査工部局總董岡崎勝男氏、對於抑抑抑止物價漲風問題之意見、謂査抑止物價之暴漲、固應探　其原因、並就物資與通貨方面、予以考量、但商人之自制制制制自肅、與夫民衆之與當局合作、關係此一問題之解決、至爲重要、基上原因、當局對於實施高壓性之取締措置、迄仍愼重將事、蓋猶翼商人之能目制自檢也、詎意當局之寬容態度、竟予一般奸商與胆敢違犯規章之徒以非法漁利之機會、誠屬憾事、此類奸商、日見增多、因此當局對於違章之人、不得不實施嚴峻罰則、</p>

<h3>今後之「上海建設計劃」　有根本改變必要　建設司長麥靜銘談話</h3>
<p>建設部都市建設司司長麥靜銘氏、來滬視察戰後之建設、已有數日、現公畢定於今日離滬、赴杭繼繪考察、記奢走訪麥司長於建設部駐滬辦事處、蒙發表此行感想如次、</p>
<p>國民政府自參戰以後、對於與培養戰力有密切關係之　業增產及生產工業之發展、面努力推進、惟對於都市建設、亦同樣重視、蓋建設事業絕緯萬端、欲求國家經濟之發展、人民思想之改進、以提高文化之水準、實現羣衆福利及培養國家之總力、完遂參戰之目的計、非努力於都市建設不可、故政府參戰後、於行政院設置建設部、而對於都市建設更特設司掌理、以專資成、本人承乏該司、自問能力有限、深恐才力不勝、尙望各界多予指導、以匡不逮、</p>
<p>京滬杭各大都市、自國府建都南京以還、經前當局之歷年苦心經營、成績斐然、但事變以後、各大都市多受戰爭之破壞、國府還都以來、雖會致力復與、惟限於時間及人力物力、故建設工作尙多未能達到預期之目標、此次奉命考察各大都市、經於本月一日到到到滬、除拜訪陳市長及各有關當局外、並視察各項公共事業、結果甚爲完滿、雖不敢說已有若何偉大復興計劃、不過最低限度、亦可以（一）藉以明瞭事變後各都市破壞情形、及經已興修程度、作將來進一步改善之張本、（二）藉此探詢各都市過去建設在施工上之困難情形、使中央興省市政府當局能協力排除此種障碍、以完成都市建設之使命、</p>
<p>此行到滬經已數日、各種公共事業均經分別詳爲視察、當此戰時特殊環境之下、而仍能不斷的改善與發展、比諸事變以前、有過之無不及、本人對於各當局之努力、深致最大之欽佩、至於事變前上海原有所謂「大上海建設計劃、在民國二十年以還，即擬發展現在之新市街地區、與租界相頡頏、使上海租界之繁榮、逐步移往該地、其後因中日事變、此項計劃無形中斷、事變後雖有恒產公司之復興計劃、期以六年時日、投資一億至二億元、以爲改造上海、使之成爲中日理想之偉大都市、乃至大東亞戰爭爆發後、此項計劃隨時代之需要、已有變更、茲者租界地區亦因各國尊重我國主權予以交還、故今後上海建設之方針、及其計劃、乃有根本改變之必要、本人視察所得、將另行擬具意見、陳報當局、以資參考、</p>

<h3>技術人員　出路困難</h3>
<p>— 陳星國</p>
<p>尋找職業爲目下一件難事，但更難的是勞方和資方的不融合，尤其是在這個年頭裏，縱有一技之長，好容易地找到了一個職位，然而因薪金太微，所入不敷所出，以致捉樣見肘，生活仍舊不能安定。</p>
<p>根據本年二月份工部局工業社會處職業介紹科的介紹紀錄，各工廠向該科登記要求技術人員共一百人，在巳登記的技術失業人羣中，經該科鄭重斟酌後而認爲可給予介紹者，竟祗有九十人，這種求過於供的現　，很足以證明尋找職業並非是一件極困難的事情：在這被介紹的九十人中，經廠方面試後而錄用者，竟僅有十人，由此可見一般人的所謂求職難者，原來是因爲他們並沒有可取的技能。</p>
<p>向工部局登記的失業技術人員中，有一個機械技工章某者，被召五次至局給其介紹職業，而每次他總是回絕不願就職；他說，與其爲人作工，月入三四百元（無膳宿），寗願自已販賣鮮魚，每日却能有二三十元盈餘；像章某這樣不願就職者，據該職業介紹科統計，凡介紹十人中有四人之多，這種現象，與其替彼等可惜其學非所用，還不如爲社會生產上着想，其損失之大，不難想像</p>
<p>勞方的技術惡劣及資方的待遇菲薄，使工業蒙受極大損害，雙方各難辭其咎，皆須亟宜改善，前者須精益求精，後者應盡量培養人才：依照目下情形，後者尤須重新考慮，並應隨時調查工人生活狀况，而改善待遇，則勞方能安心工作，其出品能自然趨於優境，生產效力也可隨之增進；生活旣能安定，則社會繁榮有厚望焉</p>
<h3>藥學專家長期研究　能自製維他命C</h3>
<p>維他命之發現、爲近代醫學史上之一大進展、對於人體健康、裨益良多、各國科學及醫學兩界、對之極爲重視、紛紛加以研究、截至目下爲止、經發現者已有二十種之多、儼然另成一種專門之學問、吾國藥廠、近年設立極多、唯對於根本之硏究工作、從事者仍屬少見、良以吾國科學落後、設備不週、人才缺乏所致、最近一部藥廠之硏究院、因國外化學品以及藥物原料之來源斷絕、紛紛自行硏究、實爲一種極佳之現象、</p>
<p>費時兩年　研究成功</p>
<p>上海社記者頃探悉、滬上一部份藥廠之硏究院、最近對於硏究工作、頗爲努力、且有一部業已成就、蓋在最近吾國科學家之硏究工作中、薩本鐵博士與施嘉鍾碩士、對製造維他命C之研究工作値得重視、據聞兩君於太平洋戰事發生之前、即從事於維他命C之研究及分析工作、希望能自行製造、經六個月之努力、未獲成功、戰事爆發之後、兩君以維他命C原料之來源斷絕、乃繼續努力、由各助手之協助、分頭進行、經二十二個月之硏究、始將使維他命C發生化變化之兩種細菌先後發見、國人自製維他命C、於焉成功、</p>
<p>檢定滿意　開始製定</p>
<p>按維他命C亦稱坑壞血酸、爲人身所不可或缺之要素、普通水菓中如橘子及檸檬內、即含有天然之維他命C、唯其不足以爲治療之用、人工製造之維他命C、乃於十年前由瑞士科學家所發現者、吾國各藥廠所用之維他命C、向來直接由外國購買原料者、現吾國科學家薩本鐵博士及施嘉鍾碩士旣已硏究成功、由中國生化製藥廠作化學·生物·及臨床三種檢定、均已認爲滿意、現已大量製造中、實爲吾國科學界光榮之一頁、</p>

<h3>青年們的職業問題</h3>
<p>— 葉敏鶴</p>
<p>凡是有志的靑年，決不願倚靠家庭之富有，度着無聊的生活，而寗願受着種種的困難及打擊，爲着自己的前途在社會上掙扎着，可是一輩社會領導者，對於靑年的前途與發展，漠不關心，一個中學畢業生，往往給他們一個如牛馬般的學徒工作，一個普通的商店，在需人員的時候，一開口就是要什麽高中程度，無論什麽機關或商店，祗要在報上欲招請一二個的人員，即刻就有成千的靑年去應徵，似軋油，米，糖，那般的爭先爲這明知希望極少的職位，甚至於大學生也有委曲求全地去應徵的。</p>
<p>尤共是現今的社會，無論工廠或公司，用人但顧情面，不顧能力，職業保障，更無從說起，待遇苛刻，往往所入不够一己之用，根本談不到養家活口了，工作時間之長，十一個鐘點的時間，對於靑年們學識自修的問題，更不必想，在工作時間以外，還須不辭勞苦地負起責任，偶然有一些小錯，則前功盡棄，即遭洶汰，絕無原諒的餘地。</p>
<p>一個靑年在離開校門或一商店，欲謀一機會踏入商業塲中，眞是難似登天，無商業經騐者不取，有經　者有否　證明書，若備有即有意外的問題來爲難你，爲什麽離開以前的服務地，當你述出過去的歷史，他們即抱着滿以爲在別處服務過的靑年是不可靠的成見，試問那兒有道麽多未入過社會而富有商業經騐者的齊年期候着呢？怎叫職業靑年與未出校門的靑年們不寒心呢，「畢業即是失業一的觀念，可以說也是從此而來的吧。</p>
<p>所以我要請社會上的一輩領導者捐棄成見，與下級人員，能切實討論，共同解決一切事件，俾能使上下感情融洽，免去一切隔膜情形，多多栽培靑年，負起眞正的領導責任，則靑年幸甚，社會幸甚！</p>

<p>經濟界　經濟譯淪轉換政策與統制經濟　　日本所聲明的交還租界和撤廢治外法權，已經漸次具體化，預料在不久的將來就可以完全實現了。這種政策的轉換，也可謂是中日關係上的劃時代大事業，兩國國民衷心希望它很順利的進行。　　日本的新政策，已經很明顯地表現在交還租界和撤廢治外法權的舉動上，這種新政策，不僅限定在租界和法權的兩項。一切政治，經濟，文化各部鬥，都有着劃時代轉換的意味，然而不能在根本上明瞭這種轉換意味的人，還有不少，這眞是非常遺憾的事。日本對華經濟政策的內容等等，也有澈底痛快的改革，不過，假使有人把這種變革認爲是從統制主義變相爲自由主義政策的話，那實在是大大的誤解。原有政策的方向和意圖，根本照常行施，沒有變動。不過改由國府來　行一切經濟政策。表現出國府的創意和力量。再就當前的內外情勢來看，經濟統制的本質，也是劃一未變，絕對不會有曖昧不明的一類事情。　　其實，日本的政策，假使用轉換兩字來觀察這不適合事實，日本的政策應該解釋是成長和發展的兩大意味。現在的一切轉換，是近衛聲明以來日本政策的理論上發展，是加强國府政策的歸結。所以一般人必需要認識它不是轉換而是成長的事實。至於統制經濟，不過是把當初適應戰時需要而由日方施行的移歸國府辦理，所以如果把它認爲是戰時統制政策的變更，完全是錯誤的觀察。在國府方面自有國府的戰時統制方策。原有的統制方策，在時間上縱然有些緩急之差，可是國府方面一定沿襲施用，這是不容懷疑的。　　目下在上海和各地從事經濟活動的人，不能明瞭這種情形，妄加憶測，以爲經濟上將有變化，大家從事投機，幹那不上軌道的經濟活動，這種勾當，眞是禍國殃民的舉動，也可以說是自掘墳墓的無智之輩。經濟人要留將來的出路，必須遵守今日的統制，認淸它的方向，以求國家，社會，個人的萬全，無中生有，誤國誤己，是最可恨而應該唾棄的。現在關於交還租界，撤廢治外法描的問題，進行極爲順利。經濟統制的移交管理，也很順利，日本的政策上轉換，不久就能完成，經濟人應該明確理解這種趨勢，作正當活動。這是我們切望於中日經濟界人士的。（雲鵬譯自三月六日大陸新報）經濟評書今後的民間經濟機構　　最高國防會議前日決議以工商團體爲純粹經濟機構，以便專心一意，協助政府奉行戰時體制下的經濟方策，尤其側重於安定民生與增强經濟力量。　　由此看來，民間經濟機構的責任，是雙重的：其一，在於安定民生。所以民間工商團體，應當負起絕對的責任起來，努力於抑平物資價格，實行實施管理制度，以防止投機囤積的繼續存在。其次，在於增强經濟力量，所以民間工商團體，同時也應該負起積極的責任起來，致力於調整物資供求，實行協助生產原料的獲致，尤其是與內地生產原料的交換，以促進物資供求的相應。　　這一個雙重的責任，旣有當局的同意，益以民意的督促，實際上已經臨到我們民間經濟界的頭上，那末，樹立於民間經濟界的工商團體，今後應當感覺責無旁貸了，因爲今後民問經濟機構這一個名詞，不復是一個空洞的標語。　　戶口調查與統制經濟　　　　戰時經濟必側重統制。而統制方法之最簡具直截者，莫如用購物證以調濟物資與金融。德國自第一次歐戰後，每日所需戰費，即達一萬萬馬克以上。此一萬萬馬克之戰費，如取給於平常國家預算內之收支，則必不足以均衡。如取給於公債之發行，則非但債額日增，且手續上亦異常困難。則仍不如增發紙幣。紙幣增發　游資必日多，而成貨幣膨脹之現象。物價日高，民不聊生。然則究如何而可？彼聰明之德國經濟家，乃思得一簡易之妙法，是即以無票購物之法是也。在上海所見者，惟購米證耳。在德國不論鉅萬之富翁，與貧困之小工，每人給以同樣之購物證。無論衣食日用凡一切所需，無不有購物證。無購物證即不能購物。於是鉅萬富翁之所可購得者亦即貧人之所可購得者也。故在德國，每日政府之所支出者，雖有萬　馬克，直接間接流通於全國。而得此款者，無所用之。除支付其購物設範圍以內之數額外，餘數除存入銀行外，無他用，勢必還流於國家銀行。故政府與國家銀行，日日支出萬萬，同時亦有萬萬之收入。物價亦停滯於官價而不得騰踴。此法誠戰時最巧妙之辦法。然如何調整生產與消費，又購物證與人口之間又如何求其脗合，則一本而萬殊，至匪易易。吾國戶口從來無確切之調查，而公務員執行民間經濟事務，又缺少經騐，則欲學德國之方法，非積極努力，恐不易見之施行。當局為迎平物價　嚴查各業商品價格　派員抽查賬冊真執行　逾越限價交易嚴予究辦　　　　當局爲徹底抑平物價，取締投機囤積起見，對於食糧·油·糖等九需品，均予計口配至於各來市場，凡含有投機性者，一律勒令停業，聽候改善。並切實執行限價，抽査各業買賣賬冊。對逾越限價者之行商，依法査封處罰，其抽査甚爲嚴格，例如各店賬冊所載售給其店之物，雖註明價格，並未超過限價，但爲愼重計，復往受買之某店調査是否符合。執行物價統制處職員已全體總動員，認眞執行。頃有若干商店，均已受査封停業處分　。中日經濟界懇談會　前日在金門飯店舉行　　　　東亞經濟懇談會華中本部，因前任興中公司社長十河信二氏來滬之機會，特於五日正午假靜安寺路金門飯店舉行中日經濟界懇談會，出席者計有日方永禮化學公司玉置豐助氏·關口猛夫氏，華方陳彬龢·殷子白·沈兩昌·袁履登·聞蘭·亭秣康侯等中日名流五十餘人，席間空氣，異常融洽，至二時許散會。（三月六日大陸新報）捲煙配給組合　準備派貨　　關於華中烟草配給組合配給上海及附近各地捲烟，以消滅捲烟黑市，經該組合當局積極籌備以來，近已大體就緒，全市各登記捲烟店之誓約，已於昨日由各大同打，依式塡寫完竣，即可開始辦理配給。頃探悉該組合之配給捲烟，決於最短期間先在上海市區着手，然後再辦上海近郊八區配給。最後，則擴展至於華中各地。至於配給價格，當然依照各種捲烟成本爲計算標準。本市酒精制造廠發生原料困難問題　　　　各種化學工業全以酒精爲唯一製造原料，而酒精本身，係從糖蜜中提煉。上海之酒精廠，向以爪哇糖蜜爲原料，目前因戰時船隻困難，遂改用乾芋，雖然手續稍繁，但入手尙易。惟最近鄕民因糧食困靴，均以乾芋爲第二食糧，故無大量運滬，價格亦高漲不已，故今日本埠各酒精廠覓購原料，殊爲困難云。採辦大宗榨油原料　半數抵滬　　食油爲民食主要物品之一，最近當局，爲安定民生，一面實施配給制度，一面並謀充實供應　向　區各地，採集大宗黃豆原料，綜計達五萬噸運滬，供給各榨油廠製油之用。其中半數業已抵埠，其餘在陸續運輸中。尙有數萬噸之菜子及棉籽，亦在設法採購中，是以嗣後油量之供應，可望相當增進，至於計口油之售賣日期，因　配當局對於數量尙需愼重考慮，故配給棧單猶未簽發云。國外經濟雜訊　　德國玻璃存貨充足　此間宣稱，德國玻璃工廠所製存貨，極爲豐富，足以應付空襲後之一切緊急需要，每年可產玻璃五千萬方公尺，大機器一座，日可製造六千方公尺，空襲後之碎玻璃，則收去重做，故玻璃供應，可以無虞匱乏云。　　法國補救油荒辦法　　法國自國外燃油來源斷絕後，燃料頓成問題，政府爲謀解決油荒起見，已努力設法補救，法國境內產油極微，班奢爾勃隆雖有油礦，但其產量卑不足道，南部海羅爾省所產油量，亦極微薄，無濟於事，在此種情形下，當局惟有利用土煤及木材，作爲燃料，法國西部土煤產量極豐，當局已開辦工廠數所，專爲製煉土煤，此外，又在西南區森林中裝置焙製木炭設備，國內爲製造此種燃料新設之工廠，已有五十所，預計其產量可以代替過去來自美國及伊拉克之燃油矣。　　芬運動家義務工作　　芬蘭運動家嚮應政府之呼籲，在森林中幫助伐木，工作之時間達二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇小時，幫助鄰居工作之時間亦達五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇小時，此等時間之價値，達一七五〇〇〇，〇〇〇馬克。而各運動員則完全係盡義務云。　　滿洲電力公司計劃　　滿洲電力公司本年擬添築高電壓電線，及沿途多數變壓站，務使所有輕重工業中心與各地電力廠相聯絡，此項計劃，約需經費一五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓，總數可自三方面獲得，即（一）借款一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓，（二）招新股四〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓，（三）動用公司公積金一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓社曾經濟界的保障　中國保健公司與中國保健協會　　人生最大之資源，厥爲自身之健康，一切經濟之發展，定以健康爲最大之原動力。最近海上經濟界以及其他各界領袖發起之中國保健公司，具有現代一切最新醫學設備，堪稱本市保健事業之創舉。其推進之各項保健工作，如市民全身健康檢査及防癆X光檢査等，非特爲發展預防醫學上之重要工作，抑亦爲加强市民發展偉大經濟力之重要因素。自上月開幕以來深爲各方矚目。該公司爲推進各項檢査工作，依照各國保健制度，發行健康證書，以期揭發疾病於未著，治療疾病於早期，藉以節省社會上之醫藥負擔。檢査費每人分一百元及五十元二種，並優待各工商團體，每人减收二十五元。此外工商界領袖刻正進行粗織中國保健協會，預料今後本市社會公衆因在健康上之增進，定可爲經濟上之發展。該公司地點在靜安寺路　九六號美琪大厦。本報經濟界啟事　　　　本版惠稿諸君均鑒：二月份酬金，業已結算淸楚，請於本月八日九日十日下午二時至叫時，向本館營業部會計處，憑本館業經送達之領酬證領取爲荷。　　經濟界編輯部啓諸者意見「增加工業貨放」的管見  王衛　　「增加工業貸放，」—從實際意義講，就是加强余融與工業的聯繫，是目前經濟政策下一個重要步驟；這一步驟能够積極地推進，在工業方面，能够使生產力提高，生產關係開展：在金融業本身，能够使業務踏上正軌，金融趨向安定；所以，我們決不能把「增加工業貸放」看作一個簡單的技術問題，而應該從其對整個經濟局勢的影響上來認識其重要性。　　根據一個月來報上公佈的，有關方面對於「增加工業貸放」實施辦法的決定，我們綜合一下，大概是這樣的主要五點。　　一，吸收游資，提高存款利息，收回非生產方面之投資　　二，調查銀行錢莊貸出之資金，是否用以從事生產或囤積。　　三，用動產不動產爲担保放款及各業商品爲抵押放款，惟須有所屬久業公會之證明。　　四，往來透支及信用放款必須有股實之保證人，保證於年度總結之前完全歸淸，利率依照每月公布之行市計算。　　五，提倡承兌匯票，幫助工商通融資金。　　這些辦法辦然　還是原則化的，在實施的時候還得考慮許多具體步驟；同時，我們應該看淸現實，上海的金融業及各業的組織是不健全的，就是說，各公會與其所屬會員的聯繫散漫得很，多數祇儘了一些傳達的工作，至於業務上監督，硏究，調査，協助，還剛剛被人提起；因之，「常碰到這個「增加工業貸放」的方針時，其在實施過程中要發生與遭遇許多困難正是意料中的事。　　在此，我就管見所及，粗略地發表一些意見，以作大家參考。　　首先，我感到，提高存息，吸收游資，收同非生產方面投資，用來增加向工業貸放，這是一個好辦法法，但怎樣才能把資金眞正的流向於工業方面呢？這郤不是一個簡單的問題了。因爲，即使銀行錢莊的貸款戶名都由工廠代替了商號，但還不能說，「增加工業貸放一這個目標已經完成，因爲「增加工業貸放　的最終目的是要使生產增加；所以，這當中有三個問題値得注意：第一，目前有許多工廠，由於銷路呆滯，製造費用鉅大，大都不願以及無能來進行生產，儘靠着原料及製品存貨賣買來維持生存的；對於這類工廠，不管其資產累積的程度如何，原則上是不能獲得貸款的，除非它開始進行生產。第二，即使正在進行生產的工廠，也得視其需要而定貸款，記得民國二十九年，正當外匯變動極烈的時候，有許多工廠，向銀行借了款子，購進鉅量原料，向堆棧一放，持棧單向銀行作押款，再購進第二批原料，再作押款…這種情形現在不能說完全沒有；所以，當貸款時—特別是抵押放款，就得嚴格的調査其是否是一定的生產時日內所需用。第三，我在「小型工廠的生產問題」一文里提起過，銀行錢莊的放款方針大都是「郤者供之，求者郤之一的，所以，一些實際上進行生產而資金短細的小型工廠是否會依舊　摒之門外？　　為了克服道三個可能發生的問題，就必須從管理方面着手，銀錢業公會與各業公會應該有一個橫的聯繫，根據各業的生產情况，來策劃貸放工作，並商討與硏究實施過程中兩方面所發生的問題；而各公會應該添設一個專門部份，來嚴密監督與審査貸放對象與生產狀態；毫無疑問，沒有健全的管理機構，就不能發揮「增加工業貸放」的効能，也就不能起「增加生產」的作用。　　其次，關於利率問題，從銀行錢莊方面講，利息是一種收入，是一筆毛利；在工廠方面，則是一種支出，是一筆生產成本；目前欠息是三十元，比起去年一月份十二元來，要增加一倍又半，這當然是通貨不安定與物價動盪情况下所引起，而不能由銀錢業來負責；我的意見，就是在通貨比較穩定，游資趨向正路（上月各銀行存款增至十三萬萬元．）的形勢下，應該審愼的來確定利率，一方面固然要顧全銀錢業的金利成本，而對於工廠方面是否因利率提高而覺得是一筆重負，亦應汪意及之：特別對於動產不動產抵押及長期信用放款的利率應該有個準則，而不能隨其「當面酌議」，承兌匯　　　貼現等亦是如此。　　第三，在進行往來透支，信用放款及抵押承兌滙票等時的保證問題，是應該予以改進的。目前有許多工廠，因爲缺乏在銀錢業認爲殷實的保證人，以致延擱，或者喪失了　支或借款；我的意見，銀錢業爲了維護債權起見，採取擔保的辦法是對的，但應該把保證人的資格降低一些，祗要其資本超過了被保人借款金額，就得予以通融。同時應該提倡相互保證辦法，各業公會對此尤須協助，務使實際生產者不因這些技術問題而阻礙了生產的順利進行。　　總結起來講，「增加工業貸放」應該釋作「增加生產貸放，」務使貸放之資金都安善的流動於生產中，如此才能收提高生產　，開展生產關係之效；末了　　認爲一切方針步貴乎脚實地的實施，複雜的經濟　　如此，「增加工業貸放」亦是這樣。經濟研究當前上海物價問題之檢討  沈錫良　　穩定物價爲當前急切之研究問題，但欲得有效之果，談何容易。蓋第一，必先澈底明瞭物價漲落實之原理，第二，要有適合現實之政策，第三，須有絕巧技術之施行；倘適合現實之政策決定旣難，絕巧技術施行不易，則尙賴社會公衆詳硏檢討。　　物價高漲，人民生活備受威脅，有識之士有鑒於此，莫不爲上海前途憂慮，而市府當局已連同各業商會，各業工會協組會議以商物價問題之對策，且根據各方人士之建議，藉以穩定物價，减輕市民負擔。　　物價統制爲穩定物價之最有効方法，所計物價統制即將貨物之價格規定一限度（最高或最低），但於戰時之物價統制，當指最高之限度而言，其施行之方法，乃視物品之性質而定，或因時間地域之不同而使統制之方法各異。茲將各國之物價統制概情略述於后：　　日本之物價統制　　　　日本鑒於物價漲勢，其在一九三九年以後從事於物價統制之辦法如下：　　（一）物資方面：（甲）增加生產力量（乙）原料品之輸入（丙）消費節對（丁）限制分配（戊）平定物價（已）取締投機　　（二）貨幣方面：（甲）資金之調整（乙）迫認公債（丙）獎勵儲蓄（丁）增加稅收　　德國之物價統制　　　　（一）間接之方法：（甲）穗定幣値（乙）發行公債以助財政（丙）增加稅收以實財政基礎（丁）促進有效生產（戊）消費統制（已）分配統制　　（二）直接之方法：（甲）不得超過規定價格（乙）提高價格須有極大之原因（丙）組織統制總監以定一切方針　　意國之物價統制　　一九三六年意阿戰爭後，意國之物價即驟起暴　之趨勢，於是有中央物價委員會之設立，由政府聯合國內各企業組織，各派代表組織，共同討論一切穩定物價之辦法。由此組織中分種種之總聯盟，如農民總聯盟，生產總聯盟，及消費總聯盟等。其決定之方法如下：　　（一）禁止高價出售（二）設法减輕成本（三）制定　高價格（四）提高物價須得中央委員會之許可　　英國之物價統制　　　　（一）增加工資：薪水階級之人民在戰時極受物價飛漲之痛苦，故政府强迫工商界等增加工資，自動增加者，亦頗衆加，因薪水階級收入有限，而支出往往數倍，所以受戰事痛苦最甚者，莫過於薪水階級之人民，故政府有强迫提高工資之實施。　　（二）設法阻止物價上漲：用直接或間接方法去阻止物價之上漲，如提高貼現率，使交通便利，　勵節約，限制消費等方法。　　美國之物價統制　　　（一）强制分配各種原料：因原料品在戰時頗爲重視，於是不得不分配之，以免囤積等事情發生。　　（三）法律及道德上之輿論：在戰時此　與論足以抑物價，於此時期內，全國人民可發生一種巨大之社會力，使人人可以鼓動其作種咱犧牲為適合羣衆之心理。　　美國議院所設之委員會實獻意見如下：　　（一）政府應用一切可能方法以籌戰費，但必須避免創造新信用。　　（二）該立即調查勞動階級之生活費指數，實際已增加若干，而後再決定增加幾成之工資。　　（三）限制利潤辦法，必須加以强化。　　（四）提高工資，必須有極充足之理由。　　（五）所有工商企業應在主管機關下統轄，採用一致政策。　　當前上海物價統制應採步驟　　　　（一）統收統賣：市府當局得將必需品自廠方及持有者之手依照評價買入，再依照評價售與平民，但向廠方收買之若干製成品，必須有相當原料配給之，使該廠得以繼續生產，不致中斷。向持有者購買之物品價格，必須以不令虧本爲原則　　（二）集資向外採購：凡市中所缺貨品，當局應集合資本，以當局名義向各地採購，運入市中，以供各業及一般人民之需要。或可規定一適當價格出售，如是，則來源疏迪，不致有供不應求之慮。　　（三）安定民心：目下市民對於物價有致看漲之心理，市府當局應盡力設法糾正之。同時，市民應自動信仰通貨，蓋通貨爲交易之媒介，以供吾人流通便利，爲民者富特別愛護，絕對信任。　　（四）査辦未呈報之囤貨：應登記之貨品，大半已向當局登記，但有少數之貨品尙未登記，而意欲逃避者，此乃不法之舉，當局應詳査嚴辦。　　（五）日川品小賣處之設立：各處設立日用品平賣之分號，可使市民廉價購買。　　（六）限制各廠各號各人之必需品存量：准存之數須視其需要及其營業範圍之大小而決定。有必需者准其儲存，否則當局可向其評價收買，以充平賣之貨品。　　（七）嚴發價格停止之命令：日本於一九三九中九月十八日，因歐洲戰事而波及之一般價格漲勢，在日本政府一紙命令之下，立吿停止。如是以後，日本一切商品價格以及工資薪水之房地租，棧租，運費，保險費等均站立於一條綫上，不得冉漲。此停止令係根據日本國家總動員法第六條第十一條與第十九條而發，實　戰時最高植威之行使，違者嚴重處罰不貸。　　總之，穩定物價非有適合現實之政策，嚴裕施行，且有絕巧之技術不爲功。尙希各界努力協助當局互商對策，以完成穩定物價之壯舉，則全市幸甚，國家幸甚。</p>

<p>白茅芻蕘之言  編者　　—代「發刊詞」　　文藝是花，是果，但我們說，文藝也是草。文藝是瑤草，是芳草，但我們說，文藝也是野草。　　「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生，」歷來以草喩小人的，都以爲這是草的可惡處，但我們以爲，這却正是草的可愛處，所謂喩小人，腐儒的話，原不値一笑。文藝的不因摧殘，蹂躪而消滅，正復相同。　　有多少美麗的名花，甜美的漿果，原來都是草本；那一種家草不是由野草長成的：草，野草，正是許多美好東西的根源。文藝是人類美好行爲的表現，以草爲象徵，總也是可以的。　　藥草可以洽病，身體上的病：文藝也可以治病，精神上的病。甚至荊棘！蒺藜，也正等於諷刺的，辛辣的文藝作品。　　「遠芳侵古道，晴翠接荒城」，正見草的美麗，可以遮掩醜惡的古道與荒城。一池塘生春草」，池塘裏便有了生氣。「雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛」，也必須在「江南草長」的時候「春水綠波」，不能不有「春草碧色來相映。「綠滿窗前」，「靑入簾內」，點綴得書齋何等幽雅。有多少情思，尤其關於別離的，一定要用草來起　。……　　草　美麗的，這樣的例證，不勝枚舉。藝術是美麗的，誰說不能用草來代表。　　草中我們喜歡茅，茅中我們喜歡白茅，我們這個文藝刋物，所以就用了「白茅一這個名稱。　　白茅並不高大，雄奇，可是遍生山野間，却也有其獨特的不可梅的氣勢。　　白茅開的花並不美麗；可是始生時的柔軟潔白，三四月裏山野間，白瑩瑩的一片，所謂「手如柔荑」，「有女如荼」，在詩經上早就說明了牠的可觀，不同凡花俗豔的可觀。　　柔荑就是茅針，每一個兒童都喜歡吃牠，甜迷迷地，還有些淸香。根很長，就是藥用的茅根，也是甜的，吃了牠的湯，可以發汗通氣，莖葉嫩的時候是很好的芻秣，老的時候可以蓋屋，也是很好的燃料，在牠的身上沒有一樣不有用，「白茅包之」不過舉共一端而已。　　我們的「白茅」，就是希望作成文藝界的白茅：有偉大的精神，不凡的美麗，與人不無小補的功用。　　「名列前茅」這句話，如果說只是在前作先鋒的意思，那末我們願意作文藝界前行的茅旌，來導引大隊的進行；如果說地位的前，就是等第的高，那末，我們就不妨以此爲目的，力爭上游。　　我們如此作，是出於我們的自願，興趣與熱心，我們絕對不爲着名利或權勢。將來如果有一些成就，能在前進的時代巨輪上推動一把，那我們就覺得所受的賞賜，遠勝於「分茅列土」了。短評文學運動的幾個問題  史新　　一　　精神上老是在彷徨抗戰」之綫，而實際上生活却站在相反的地位。旣不「抗戰」，又不和平。像這樣失去了行動性與決斷力的不明不白不澈底的文化人，簡直沒有資格談到一切了。　　在這種人身上決不能期待着對於中國文學運動有絲毫實獻的。　　二　　凡是新中國的居民，都已收到兩張支票。不用說一張是南京國民政府一張是日本簽出的。不管理由何在，置身於此便是同意接受支票，已同意接受，那末留下來的只是兌現的問題了。　　現在一切生活上的苦悶，多由支票未能完全兌現。推其原因，有的是不得已的。有的是簽發人錯誤。有的是持票人自己的過失。不得已的應該原諒它或促進它兌現。簽發人錯誤的應該糾正它。持票人自己過失的應該要自己反省。這樣，從生活上的苦悶去照出不能兌現的原由和狀况而加以原諒促進糾正反省。便是新中國文學目前描寫目標的核心問題。　　三　　文學運動幷不是文學者的包辦事業。創作也不是職業文人的專賣品。和大衆遊離的文學，那裏談得到文學的建設性鬥爭性或時代性？美文麗句是　「文舉匠」幹的勾當。新中國文舉運動的現階段，這些都沒有需要的。　　都市農村工廠公司機關等等，各人從各人的職業中，站在上述的立塲，去描寫報吿小說化出來，這就是新中國文學運動現階段中最正確的路綫。編者的話　　在這狹小的篇幅中，編者實在不應該喋喋，取厭於人。但有些話却不能不和讀者談談，所以還是免不了要寫上幾句。　　我們想將出版界每月刋佈的文藝作品，擇尤加以批評與介紹，以便提高這項作品的程度。但我們一則不想包辦這種工作，二則我們耳目有限，見聞未必週到，希望讀者能與我們合作盡量供給這種稿子。不過我們希望這種稿子絕對不是捧塲的或洩憤的，而是眞正的介紹與批評。　　讀者如果要將自己的作品，不論已否出版過，來請我們批評和介紹，我們也很願意勉爲效勞。　　要將本刊辦到怎麽樣，我們自然也有一個標準。但我們更盼望熱心的讀者，肯給我們善意的指導，匡正我們，鼓勵我們。　　在短短的時期中，本刊接到的來稿，眞可以說非常之多。這當然很使我們高興，有這些從事文藝的人，來嘉惠我們；但我們也很慚愧，我們的篇幅那樣少，不能多量地容受所有的佳作。嘉陵江上  章甦　　嘉陵江在秋季是最美麗不過的。春夏時黃濁的水已變爲澄淸碧綠，悠悠東流喃喃輕唱。秋天的陽光又是那麽輝煌柔媚，映得江面燦爛耀眼，長空萬里，纖雲朶朶。江風吹得人禁不住要哼一隻小曲。　　一隻木船正在逆流而進，河岸上拉縴的在前面齊整地彎着腰行走，船頭撐竿的人齊聲呼喊，響澈兩岸。船梢把舵的人戴着一只呢毡小帽，口裏含着一枝長長的水烟管，直眼看，一手把舵，一手持着烟管。　　在舵傍坐着兩個年輕的藝術家，正在畫着，畫素描的是一個姑娘，圓臉，亮眼，長長的輕飄的頭髮，健康的氣色。那在速寫的是一個男靑年，叫譚勇，廣東人，却沒有南國慣常的熱情和剛强的外表，看上去他很憂鬱，脣角聚閉，顯得很有個性只是臉色蒼白。他們兩人都是大學生，學的是藝術，這天正從沙坪壩校本部回到柏溪分校去。　　「唉他又動了，」姑娘嘆息道看着那把舵的正在衣兜裏掬出烟草望烟嘴裏塞。　　「誰叫你不速寫的，」他的同伴說。「看我畫成了。」說着，他把手中的畫板遞給采眞。采眞不服氣似地一笑，接過那畫板來。　　「畫得正好，」她瞇着兩眼，手拿著畫伸得直直的，「送給我吧！我要留着它作爲我們在一個明暢的秋日同在嘉陵江上航行的紀念。」靑年默不作聲，略略點一下頭。　　「我這幅畫也不畫了，」姑娘又望望那顚起了脚尖，伸長了頸子在遠眺的船老大。這時船正經過一段最激烈的急灘，水聲轟轟，湍流汹湧。船身彷彿被激流抱住不放，在拚命掙扎似地。這裏時常有船觸岩沉沒。每到這急灘，船上每人不由得都緊張起來。這時這叫采眞的姑娘和譚勇靜默地相對着，因爲耳際的浪濤聲使他們的談話不易，他們都不開口，只是默察着這非常原始的人力和天然的爭鬥。終于，船安然渡過了這難關，浪花射激岩石的聲響逐漸消失於後。一切復歸平靜。　　采眞覺得有一種寂寞之感她忽然想起譚勇一定心底裏很寂寞的；她難得看見譚勇有說有笑像普通校中的同學們。而今天他特別沈鬱。是什麼緣故呢？是秋天？因爲譚勇在說：「這樣暖和的秋天倒是不易多得的。但是你可覺得這四川將有一種氣息尤其是在秋季，它使我懷念故鄉，這時紅葉正盛茂。」　　「紅葉到處有，」采眞輕輕地說。她不願意在這樣的好天氣下哀愁，也不許別人懷鄉。「你喜歡大堡麼。那裏有很多紅葉，我們幾時去拾些回校，好不好？」　　「好的，」譚勇回答，無可奈何的順從了他那活潑溫和的女伴。他有什麼權利要她來分嘗自己的苦惱呢？而且這苦惱究竟是什麽，他自己也模糊不淸。「最好我們多的些人去玩，多多的拾些紅葉同來，」他像很快樂地提議了。　　「多邀些同伴？」采眞隨聲應着。這是不平常的呢，平常譚勇總是怕同伴，甚至連采眞最好的女友甦也不敢打擾他們兩人。「無疑的，采眞微感痛苦的想，「他在希望我邀婉思同去。但他爲什麼不喜歡更多的同伴呢？」因此她接着就說，「好的好的，」「我回去就邀婉思她們來，好嗎？」聽見，婉思兩字，他倒反而像意外似地朝她注視一下。兩人的目光碰在一起，又都避開了　　「攏了攏了，」船艙裏有人在嚷。船在靠岸，是大竺林前的土灣，離柏溪還有五里，可是綠樹成蔭的松柏已在望，淡淡的靑山綠水。柏溪溝包着全國最高學府的靈魂和軀壳呢。　　一片平坦的沙地，岩石三五成羣地堆砌着。一條長石橋跨過那個山澗流成的狹溪溝。溪兩邊是高岩和柏樹，柏溪溝就以此而成名。大學區未曾構成之前，這裏也和對江一樣的統稱爲二塘。山坡朝上，有一長條石階。初走的人總要喘氣，不住地歇歇足，又回頭望望江面。但采眞和譚勇以及那裏許多敎師和學生，是天天要上下一兩回的。　　走盡那石階便利了羊腸小徑的柏溪市面。這時你再回頭就看不見江水了，要直到你穿過一座小巧紅漆的木橋（算是校門，）再爬上幾百級石階，到了學校的最高一座屋（療養院）旁邊，才能重見那不斷東流的江水，和江對岸一切美麗的靑山，紅屋，松坡。　　藝術科敎室是全校最低的一層，僅高於門房一層。西畫室却又較國畫敎室高八十石級。采眞和譚勇在國畫室各人的畫桌邊休息一會，便互道「會見」，各自回宿舍去。　　他們從大堡回來每人手中都拿有一些花花草草，大都是紅葉與白蘆。陸續地從小木船跳上岸灘，大家快樂地一起向「老太婆老糟湯圓」舖走去。那老糟店在一塊大岩對面，是一間破陋矮小的泥地草房，一邊是爐火，一邊就是僅有的兩隻木方桌，幾隻長板凳的雅座。做老糟湯圓的是一個愛說愛笑的老太婆，很乾凈相，所以采眞等總來這裏吃湯圓。　　「老糟冲蛋，幾碗？」老太婆笑嘻嘻地迎着靑年主顧們　　「五碗，」采眞應道。他們是五個人：譚勇，婉思，甦，嘉，和采眞。　　「我來幫你吧，」甦對老太婆說，就離開坐着的四個同伴走到灶前。婉思是第一次上這地方，她很快樂，微笑着。譚勇也很快樂，看着她那富於南國味的女孩一雙長睫毛的大眼和兩條很長很鬆散的不算小的辮予，覺得她正像「秋天裏的春天。」嘉是個沉默的哲學家，他愛着甦，雖然他們的性格不相同。采眞仍舊是活潑友愛的好伴侶。她是學校中的「歌后。」她不驕傲，她底質朴正長她的可愛處。　　「婉思，你喜歡來這裏學畫嗎，」采眞打破了沉默說。　　「當然喜歡但總得明年才能來考啊，」婉思回答。「我怕考不取。」　　「不會的。我看見你畫的自畫像，覺得你實在比我們這裏有些同學還好得多。」譚勇在傍揷嘴道：　　「你可以常常來這裏玩玩，看看他們畫，不很好嗎？」嘉也開口了，他是爲禮貌才說話的。那三個藝術家都笑着點頭。甦已經端着兩碗滿滿的老糟走來了。　　這一天又是那麽的天高氣爽。晚上月明星稀，他們又在一起暢叙一番。　　歸來，采眞躺着不能入眠，禁不住的嗚咽悲泣了。睡在她上舖的甦從夢中醒來，聽見采眞在哭。她了解她朋友底悲哀，可是言語眞的能給人什麽安慰呢？她只能輕輕地喊了幾聲：「采眞，睡吧。」　　然而采眞終於放聲的哭了一次。那是採紅葉之後一星期，甦從柏溪七里外的童家溪趕塲回校，一個同房的同學對她說：「快去，采眞哭得好傷心，誰也勸不住她」。　　「爲什麽了？」甦緊急地問。　　「還不是爲了譚勇！眞不懂：譚勇有什麽好，値得這樣愛戀他！」那同學有點氣憤的說。　　一路甦遇到的女同學們都在講這件事，可是到底什麽事，誰也不淸楚。她跑進寢室，見采眞在牀上背朝外的抽着肩頭。　　「采眞，」她俯身喚她，用手把采眞的臉轉過來。只見采眞眼睛紅紅的撅起着嘴，　兩頰儘是淚痕。「來，采眞，我們外面去。」甦把采眞硬拉出牀，替她理一理散髮，擦乾了淚，帶他到了一個墳石上，就在宿舍後向的山坡間。坐定後，甦還沒有開口，采眞又哭了。甦同情她的好朋友，自己雖沒有什麽具體的傷心事，却也悲哀地哭了。　　「甦，不要，」采眞却央求似的說。她以爲甦不應同情她；她周圍誰不在指摘她傻呢？　　「告訴我，你有什麽不快樂」甦說。　　「我接了譚勇一封信。」　　「信！你們在同一敎室裏還寫信！」甦特意大驚小怪的嚷道。　　「而且他還貼了郵票由郵局寄的呢！」采眞說。　　「眞的？」甦這次是眞的驚奇了，她不禁出聲笑了，采眞也覺得這件事本身好笑，也笑了。於是兩人不再哭喪着臉了。　　「譚勇承認自己愛婉思，也曉得我愛他。我並不是嫉妒，我是爲他底不幸而悲哀。是的，他是不幸的和我一樣不幸。你可以想像得到，婉思並不愛他，而且也不會愛他，因爲牠愛着那個嘉陵歌詠團的團長。」采眞一口氣說了這一串括。　　「這就是悲劇底存在了。，每個人都追求着不可得的東西。采眞，你或許僅是因爲得不到他的愛才愛他的呢！」甦哲學地說。「而且，你可憐他，你太好了，采眞，他們也不配來愛你」。　　「不，我有什麼好！不過你說得對；我可憐他。我所以和他親近也由於可憐他底孤單。在偌大數量裏，他總是躱在角落裏埋頭畫着寫着，有時其想着。多麼寒冷的人生！我要使他熱情快活一點。我的確關切他。真的，如果婉思能愛他，我就不悲傷了。」　　「偉大的愛情，牠眞能使人變得如此崇高麽？」甦狡猾地笑着說。「但是，采眞，眼淚總是愚蠢的，你以後再不可哭！」　　「可哭的事却那麼多呵，甦。」采真說，「我索性吿訴你吧。我最痛苦的是自己天賦的不美貌。我知道譚勇非常感激我，喜歡我，他也可說是愛着我的。但他嫌美中不足，因爲我不是美人兒模樣。他的藝術大性使他愛美。自然美　也是他愛的。但美德和美貌在一起，他才能滿足。你看，婉思很美，不是嗎？」　　「可憐的采眞！」甦實在可憐她的天眞純潔的朋友。「你被他欺騙了，他又受了藝術的謊騙。什麽是美呢？各人有不同的美的觀念。你想他將來不會又發現一個比婉思更美的人嗎？」　　「我不知道，」采眞軟弱地說。　　太陽已西斜，地面上有瘦長的人影在向她們坐處移動。原來是同學來找她們去晚膳，因爲晚上有營火會，所以晚餐提早。　　甦和采眞呆呆地望着她們，突然靜默了起來。</p>

<h3>Achieving Streamlined Administration Through Organizational Adjustment</h3>
<p>Since the National Government entered the war, in order to meet the practical needs after participation, political institutions have been gradually undergoing reasonable adjustments. Therefore, the people of the country place great expectations on the political future. However, we further hope that the government will implement the requirement of "streamlined administration." To this end, we offer the following suggestions based on our observations:</p>
<p>Firstly, the relationship between central and local institutions should be more closely linked. Local governments and the central government are inherently one. Except for financial and tax revenues, which must be handled uniformly, local affairs can be handled by local governments without direct involvement from central ministries. Also, apart from the accounting system, which should be transcendent, there is no need for extra organizations that are also transcendent. For example, farms, forestry centers, agricultural experiment stations, and social service organizations should be managed by local governments or private organizations, with the government in a supporting and guiding role. This will be more effective than having the central government directly manage them, and all malpractices will be easier to prevent. Similarly, for cooperative administration, there is no need for quasi-transcendent organizations. We hope to restrict the direct handling of business by central government agencies in the provinces. If research results suggest that certain businesses should be operated by the state, local governments can still assume responsibility, rather than having central ministries directly manage them.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to implement streamlined administration, the number of central and local institutions must be reviewed and adjusted. In the past, there was a common phenomenon in our country's politics: the number of central and local institutions were completely consistent. If there was a certain institution in the central government, there would be the same institution in the local government, in a top-down manner. For example, if the central government had a certain ministry, the province would have a certain department or division, and the county would have a certain section. This was not only unnecessary but also led to overworked officials and suffering people, which often arose from this. This political custom is no longer widespread, but it cannot be said that it no longer exists at all, so it should be noted. In principle, the central government and local governments can be separated, and separation is necessary for design, guidance, and implementation of national policies. However, at the local level, the situation is simpler, so integration is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Thirdly, some institutions were originally established as temporary measures, and there is no need to continue them now that the circumstances have changed. There are also some institutions that have virtually nothing to do but were established simply to avoid a perceived deficiency. These should be abolished. As for institutions with similar functions and light workloads, they should be merged. All of this is to save public funds and simplify administration. If the talent is usable, they can be transferred to suitable institutions. We hope that this streamlined administration will be implemented in the central government and extended to local governments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scope of state-operated businesses should be quickly defined. In recent years, state-operated businesses have been increasing. In the future, as a result of the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Agreement and the transfer of enemy property and concessions, the scope of state-operated businesses will inevitably expand. For large-scale operations such as foreign trade and transportation, and small-scale operations such as charitable relief, the question will arise as to what should be state-operated and what should be privately operated. We believe that the state's human and financial resources are limited, and these small state-operated businesses are directly under the central government, or thousands of miles away, making supervision and command impossible. Malpractices will inevitably arise, and the local people will be adversely affected. Therefore, the scope of state-operated businesses should be thoroughly considered. For businesses that are insignificant or can be handled by people's organizations, such as social services and social welfare, the state can play a guiding role. Even for some industrial, commercial, agricultural, and auxiliary transportation businesses, it is not necessary for the state to directly operate everything. This will not only avoid the suspicion of "competing with the people for profit" but also achieve the effect of "streamlined administration," and the utilization of civilian power can also be realized here.</p>
<p>Editorial Commentary</p>
<h3>Scientific Research Under the Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>As the war intensifies, it is becoming a war of attrition. Our material war power is inferior to the enemy's in quantity. We must surpass the enemy in quality. Major inventions in war science are no less advantageous than winning a battle. Therefore, from the point of view of their effect, the responsibility of scientific researchers is indeed very heavy.</p>
<p>Recently, the extraordinary efforts of Japanese scientists have achieved noteworthy results in many fields, which is gratifying. However, in terms of the demands of the current situation, has the total efficiency of the scientific researchers been fully exploited? In our view, in the current decisive battle period, the highly efficient exploitation of scientific research has not yet reached its maximum utilization.</p>
<p>Everyone admits that science is important in enhancing war power, which is an abstract principle. Therefore, in reality, all factors that hinder the increase in efficiency must be fully resolved. Both the government and the scientists have matters to reflect on in order to promote this.</p>
<p>First, for the government, one of the most important things is the human resource problem of scientific researchers. All undertakings are done by people, but the proportion of people has rarely had such a significant impact as in scientific research. If a capable and talented leader wants to realize his special creativity, he must have co-researchers and assistants who are willing to engage in research and experimentation; furthermore, he must have new and energetic people, like supporting hands and feet, as loyal research assistants. Scientific research, like war, cannot succeed with only a commander, no matter how capable he is.</p>
<p>Secondly, scientific researchers should be allowed to immerse themselves in research. Originally, there were many talented scientific researchers among university professors in Japan. However, since the establishment of new departments and divisions, due to the lack of talent, combined with the busyness of part-time teaching and strengthening academic affairs, and the increasing amount of school chores, as well as being busy with frequent meetings of various committees, a lot of time is indeed wasted. It must be understood that truly effective scientific achievements are mostly produced in research laboratories. Therefore, the non-research trivia that capable researchers are responsible for should be adjusted. We earnestly hope that the Ministry of Education authorities will carefully consider this in the implementation of the academic system.</p>
<p>Third, there is the issue of material assistance for scientific research, namely, the problem of materials and money. Currently, the provision of essential items for scientific research should be assisted to the extent possible. In addition, universities have recognized in recent years that money is essential for research. Now is an era when money is indispensable.</p>
<p>The above is to remind the government to recognize the essence of scientific research. On the other hand, there are also many points on which scientists are expected to frankly reflect. Scientists should earnestly recognize what scientific problems are currently urgently needed by the country and should engage in research. Moreover, the specialized fields and the degree of ability of each researcher are clearest among the scientists. Therefore, the scope of research assignments should be carefully determined by the scientists themselves, and they should be strictly cautioned against extending to unnecessary parts in many fields. At the same time, specialization is of course very narrow. If it is interpreted as trivial, and therefore the fundamental theoretical technology is neglected, making it impossible to exert capable talent, it can be said that this is the country's uneconomicality. When organizing specialized committees on particularly important issues, this point must be fully considered.</p>
<p>Moreover, during the decisive battle period, in order to promote the success of scientific research and avoid unnecessary duplication, scientists researching the same problem should contact each other, constantly inform each other of the degree of progress, and cooperate wholeheartedly in research.</p>
<p>These are all platitudes and easy to implement, but if the old ways are not changed, implementation will definitely not be smooth. The relevant parties should recognize the importance of the current situation, sacrifice personal interests for the public good, take the front-line soldiers' hearts as their own, and fight hard to implement the country's goals. Only in this way can the highest efficiency be achieved. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army on the Border of Yunnan and Burma Defeats the Chongqing and British Armies, the Chongqing Army in the Nujiang Area is Completely Annihilated, and the Japanese Army Occupies Dege in the Myitkyina Area</h3>
<p>Yangon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, in various places on the northern border of Myanmar and Yunnan, has defeated the US and Chongqing armies that stubbornly resisted, and has thoroughly attacked the British Indian army and Chongqing army that attempted to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The Japanese army has broken through the Gaoligong Mountains and annihilated about two divisions of the Chongqing army near Mamian Pass, and continued to mop up the remnants of the Chongqing army in that area and advanced forward. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked and occupied Bimo. Xie Jinsheng's unit of the Chongqing army seems to have withdrawn from the area earlier for fear of the Japanese army's attack. There is still an unfinished barracks remaining there, and many tools left behind by the Chongqing army, which is enough to prove its embarrassment when retreating. The mountainous area between Bimo and Dege has accumulated about three feet of thunder, the road is rugged, and it is difficult for people and horses to travel. The Japanese army is currently rushing to repair the road and continue to advance. On March 1, the Japanese army attacked the main force of the Fourth Division of the Chongqing army in the Mingzhi River Zaxi Valley. The Japanese army also swept the Chongqing army near Weipan Street with a part of its troops, and another team of the Japanese army also swept the Chongqing army near Taiping Street, Shunjiang Street, and Maoding Street. Now, the "Chongqing army" in the Nujiang area of Yunnan has been completely annihilated. In the North Myanmar area, the Japanese army encountered the British Indian army northeast of Myitkyina. After a fierce attack by the Japanese army, it has occupied Dege. The Japanese army that advanced towards Bimo has joined forces with the troops that occupied Bimo. The Japanese army north of Myitkyina has defeated the Chongqing army north of Gongsupaizhipu, and has confirmed the bridges at the crossing of the river near the area, and has defeated the British and Chongqing armies in the Baoga area northwest of Myitkyina, and has occupied the area. Also, the Japanese army that advanced from the upper reaches of the Gengdewan River has also defeated the British and Chongqing armies in the mountains east of the area, and then encountered more than 500 British and Chongqing armies at a certain pass. After an hour of fighting, the enemy was completely defeated.</p>

<h3>Military Commission Revises Method of Allocating Military Rice, Outstanding Police Rice is Changed to Subsidy</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - In order to stabilize the lives of soldiers, the Military Commission has experimented with the division of rations and pay. The first step was to establish a temporary method for allocating military rice, allocating military rice according to the actual number of soldiers, which was claimed and distributed by the various troops. Now that the National Government has participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the originally planned method has also been tested, the temporary method for allocating military rice has been revised according to the current actual situation, focusing on adapting to the wartime food system and stabilizing the lives of soldiers. It is stipulated that the military rice issued shall not be deducted in price, and the procedures and deadlines for military rice claims and reports shall be strictly stipulated and strictly implemented. In addition, the food management committee's outstanding police rice for police agencies in various provinces and cities from December of the 30th year to March of the 31st year has also been processed by the General Supervisory Office of the Military Commission and the Ministry of Finance will allocate and reissue the police rice subsidy fee under the remaining amount of the police rice subsidy fee for those four months, according to the actual number of police officers in each province and city in each month. The subsidy fee for December of the 30th year is 6 yuan and 8 jiao per person per month, 3 yuan and 5 jiao for January of the 31st year, 7 yuan and 5 jiao for February, and 8 yuan for March. The police agencies in the jurisdiction of the North Jiangsu Headquarters only issued the subsidy fee for December of the 30th year due to incomplete rosters. The Ministry of Finance was notified to issue the subsidy fee on March 1 of this year, and the Executive Yuan and the provincial and municipal governments were notified to instruct the police agencies to send personnel to claim and distribute the subsidy fee, in order to show consideration.</p>

<h3>Central Grain Storage Bureau to be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government officially participated in the Greater East Asia War, in view of the importance of wartime food administration, a Ministry of Food was specially established during the reform of administrative institutions to take charge of this matter. Since its establishment, the ministry has made many plans for grain regulation, management, and increased production. In order to avoid confusion between food administration and food business, a unified management office for rice and grain procurement and sales was established, directly under the ministry, specializing in rice and grain procurement and sales. It is learned that the ministry will establish a Central Grain Storage Bureau to continue handling the above-mentioned rice and grain procurement and sales business, which has been approved by the Central Political Committee and is currently being actively prepared. It is expected to be formally established at the beginning of next month. All organizational systems and business scope of the bureau are also being meticulously determined by relevant agencies.

<h3>The Entirety of Soviet Fighting Power</h3>
<p>— Written by Katsuji Fuse</p>
<p>Propaganda Minister of Germany, Joseph Goebbels, said to the world from Berlin on February 18th:</p>
<p>"The Soviet government's clever concealment led the German army to misjudge the Bolsheviks' fighting power. Now we finally understand the full extent of Soviet fighting power and the reasons for its vastness."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is the most skilled at concealment and the most adept at counterintelligence. First, the Soviet Union implements a domestic passport system; second, the Soviet Union has a secret police organization; third, the Soviet Union is a so-called "closed country."</p>
<p>The domestic passport system had been implemented since the Tsarist era, and it was further strengthened during the Soviet era. People cannot live even for a day without a passport. The reason why the enemy's fifth column cannot enter the Soviet Union is primarily due to the existence of the domestic passport system.</p>
<p>The secret police are the vanguard of espionage abroad and an iron wall of espionage at home. Because the Soviet Union is "surrounded by capitalist countries," the secret police are tasked with closely guarding against all countries, peering at enemies both internal and external with sharp eyes.</p>
<p>Similarly, because the Soviet Union is "the only red country in a white world," it strictly adheres to an extreme policy of national isolation. Foreigners' entry into the country is severely restricted, and the secret police constantly follow the very few foreigners who are allowed to enter, preventing them from understanding the situation within the country. In this way, the Soviet Union has become a "closed country," which is extremely advantageous for counterintelligence. At the same time, we must remember that the Soviet Union is also the most skillful country in espionage.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of its convenient position for counterintelligence, the Soviet Union often conceals its true strength, causing enemy countries to overlook it. On the twenty-fourth anniversary of the revolution on November 7th of the year before last, a wartime military parade was held in the auxiliary capital of Kuibyshev. Marshal Voroshilov, the former People's Commissar of Defense and one of the Soviet leaders, inspected the parade. Diplomats and military attachés from various countries were very interested in this parade, but the troops inspected consisted of only three divisions, and most of them were foot soldiers. The types of weapons were very basic, and the ethnicity of the soldiers was mixed. After that, mechanized units came out, but all that was seen were mortars and machine guns towed by wire on supply wagons, small tanks used in the civil war, and old-fashioned field guns pulled by agricultural tractors. This was considered the mechanized unit, and it was actually displayed to the diplomatic corps in Lenin Square.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has always held military parades twice a year (May 1st, Labor Day, and November 7th, the anniversary of the revolution), using this as an opportunity to boast about its military equipment to other countries. During the first few years of implementing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union always presented all of its new weapons. Large formations of heavy bombers flew in the sky, and countless light and heavy tank units roared on the ground, flaunting their power in Red Square.</p>
<p>Why did the Soviet Union do this? In short, the Soviet Union could not avoid war in any way before the completion of the Five-Year Plan, so it deliberately exaggerated the Red Army's perfect equipment to prevent the great powers from daring to attack the Soviet Union rashly. However, the Kuibyshev military parade in November of the year before last was completely the opposite, deliberately displaying untrained reserves and old-fashioned artillery, so that people would think that the Soviet Union's reserves were trained in this unskilled way, and that the Soviet army's equipment was so crude. Therefore, the great winter counteroffensive was not worth mentioning... The Soviet Union used this clever method of concealment to intimidate Britain and the United States, implying that if they did not step up the supply of weapons and open a second front, the Red Army would be defeated by the German army. What a clever method of concealment!</p>
<p>In the second winter counteroffensive this time, the Soviet Union sent a huge reserve force to the front line, its strength far exceeding that of the Axis forces. Even the German authorities acknowledged this. Since the start of the war, the Red Army's losses have been extremely heavy, with deaths, injuries, and prisoners totaling millions. Therefore, the Red Army that appeared on the front line during the second winter counteroffensive was mostly a newly formed reserve force. But where was this vast new Soviet reserve army formed, and where did it come from?</p>
<p>When the Red Army's defeat in the first summer campaign of the year before last came to an end, Marshal Voroshilov, the commander of the Red Army's Northern Front, and Marshal Budyonny, the commander of the Southern Front, were suddenly transferred from the front line to the rear. At the time, many people thought that the two marshals had been relegated to the reserves because they were responsible for the defeat. However, the truth was that they were entrusted by Stalin with the important mission of "organizing and training a large-scale reserve force for the future winter counteroffensive" and retreated to the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>Why did Stalin choose these two marshals to entrust with the preparation for the Red Army's comeback? There is a very interesting historical reason for this. In the early years of the October Revolution, the counter-revolutionary armies led by the three generals Kaledin in the east, Denikin in the south, and Yudenich in the west rose up all at once. In particular, Denikin's army advanced north with the force of a bamboo splitting, and its vanguard, the Mamontov cavalry corps, had already reached Kursk south of Moscow. In the autumn of 1919, in the midst of the Soviet government's decline, in order to reverse the situation, it attempted to organize a Red cavalry corps to counter Mamontov's cavalry corps. It specially promoted Voroshilov and Budyonny to take on this critical situation. The newly formed First Red Cavalry Army, with Voroshilov as the political commissar and Budyonny as the commander, launched a brave counteroffensive, routing all before it, and the Soviet government's crisis was resolved. From that time on, Voroshilov and Budyonny were known as "specialists in organizing reserve forces in defeat."</p>
<p>During the first summer offensive, the German army's fierce attacks were extremely rapid. In particular, the vanguard of the Central Army led by Marshal Bock had already approached the southwestern suburbs of Moscow. At this critical moment of survival, Stalin suddenly recalled the crisis of 1919, and at the same time thought of using Voroshilov and Budyonny to organize reserve forces in defeat.</p>
<p>Since the autumn of the year before last, in the Ural Mountains and the upper reaches of the Volga River, the Soviet Union has gathered nearly ten million strong men from all over the country. Under the guidance of Marshals Voroshilov and Budyonny, they have organized a reserve force and begun training, attempting to launch a major counteroffensive in the second winter war. Sure enough, when the second winter counteroffensive began on November 19th last year, Marshal Voroshilov reappeared on the front line. The first winter counteroffensive was a collaboration between Marshal Timoshenko and General Zhukov. This time, in the second winter counteroffensive, Timoshenko left the front line (reportedly dispatched to the United States), and the counteroffensive was commanded by Marshals Voroshilov and Zhukov. Zhukov exhausted his experience from the first winter counteroffensive, while Voroshilov used the reserve force he had organized and trained to launch the second great winter counteroffensive.</p>
<p>There is no confirmed report of Marshal Budyonny's comeback, but the cavalry corps he trained is now fighting in southern Soviet Union. The organization of the reserve force was unknown to the German side, as it was secretly trained and formed in the Ural Mountains over the past year.</p>
<p>The Ural Mountains and the upper reaches of the Volga River serve as the base for organizing the reserve force, as mentioned above. At the same time, this area is also the Red Army's arsenal, undertaking important tasks, so it is worth mentioning. The German-Soviet battlefield this winter is different from last winter. Both armies have deployed a considerable number of tanks, so the battle situation is extremely fierce. The climate this winter is higher than last winter, and considerable effort is being put into researching cold-resistant aircraft and cold-resistant tanks. However, the Soviet Union's aircraft and tanks have recovered their decline due to the replenishment from Britain and the United States. A large number of British- and American-made tanks appeared on the southern Soviet battlefield this winter, and it is also a fact that the Red Army's equipment is still mainly self-made.</p>
<p>In the first year of the German-Soviet war, the western half of Ukraine was captured by the Soviet Union, and the eastern half was lost in the second year. The entirety of Ukraine, the Soviet Union's largest industrial base, fell into German hands. This led to a sharp decline in its industrial productivity, so the replenishment of tanks and aircraft had to rely on aid from Britain and the United States. However, in this winter's counteroffensive, the Soviet Union gathered a surprising number of troops on the front line, and at the same time, self-made tanks and the latest weapons were continuously transported to the front line. This is because the industry of the already fallen Ukraine has been replaced by the leap in production in the Ural industry.</p>
<p>In the Ural industrial zone, at the beginning of last year, Stalin claimed that the manufacturing of weapons would "increase to two or even three times the previous year." At the beginning of this year, he firmly stated that it must "increase to twice the previous year." The Ural industry was already in a state of wartime mobilization, so its production efficiency naturally developed to the maximum extent. Sure enough, in the second and third years, there was a surprising increase in production as expected. So how could the Ural industry have such a surprising increase in production? Of course, such a large increase in production could not have been achieved solely by improving the original industrial capacity of the Ural. The production of the Ural industry was nothing more than the result of skillfully relocating the Ukrainian industry.</p>
<p>The Soviet government had long foreseen that once the German-Soviet war broke out, Ukraine would be a battlefield, and the industry in this area could not be relied upon. Therefore, when implementing the Five-Year Plan, it prepared to build a second industrial base in the Ural, which is the famous Ural-Kuznetsk Combine, formed by the combination of the rich iron ore resources in the Ural and the coal in Kuznetsk in central Siberia.</p>
<p>The central cities of the Ural industry are Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Magnitogorsk. The factories built in these cities are large in scale. After the German-Soviet war broke out, when the German army approached Ukraine, the machinery from factories in Kharkiv, Stalingrad, and Voroshilovgrad had already been taken out and assembled in factories in various parts of the Ural. The Kremlin displayed an astonishing skill in the transfer of Ukrainian industry to the Ural. After the Ural received a lot of mechanical support from Ukraine, its productivity was bound to increase sharply. The "pledge of doubling production" for the Ural industry for the first time this year cannot be regarded as mere propaganda from the Soviet side.

<h3>German Forces South of Kharkov Complete Encirclement of Soviet Forces; Soviet Offensive Shifts to Lake Ilmen; Soviet Landing Attempt at Taganrog Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Daimai News Agency) - According to news received here last night, German forces launched a fierce counteroffensive on the southern Soviet front, defeating the elite of the Soviet forces and forcing the remnants and mobilized reserves to retreat across the Donets River. German bridgeheads have been established on the east bank of the river. Lisichansk, 50 kilometers northeast of Slavyansk, has fallen into German hands, and the 250-kilometer-long German lines along the river have been solidified in preparation for the next stage of the battle. However, a large Soviet force has gathered in the Kupyansk district and may launch a counteroffensive. At the same time, German forces south of Kharkov have completed their encirclement of the Soviet 3rd Tank Army. This Soviet unit attempted to break out on Thursday but was repulsed, and the encirclement has been tightened further. On the central front, the Soviet commander has shifted his offensive from the Kom Veliki Luki area to the Stellaye Rusa south of Lake Ilmen. Soviet forces in this area attacked between Veliki Luki and Kom on Wednesday without progress, and ceased operations in the area on Thursday, instead intensifying their pressure in the Stellaye Rusa area, attacking on both sides of the city, but were repulsed by German forces. The Soviets lost 24 tanks. Southwest of Rzhev and east of Gzhatsk, Soviet forces launched further attacks, but the fighting there was only of a local nature. Regarding the fighting there, German sources denied the Soviet claim that the railway between Vyazma and Smolensk had been cut. Southwest and northwest of Orel, and west and northwest of Kursk, Soviet forces continued to pressure German lines, attempting to break through the German defenses around Orel, but this offensive has collapsed and the Soviets have suffered heavy losses. Further south, German forces, after occupying Akhtyrka, 125 kilometers from Kharkov, are gradually advancing northwest of Kharkov. There has been only slight activity on the Mius River front north of Taganrog. In the Novorossiysk area of northwestern Caucasus, Soviet forces attempted to reinforce last night, with reinforcements approaching the coast by boat. German coastal artillery bombarded them, breaking up the Soviet reinforcement landing attempt. Downstream of the Kuban River, melting snow and ice is hindering Soviet operations. The Soviets in this area were only able to engage in small-scale operations on Thursday, which were unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Soviet Reconnaissance toward Smolensk Thwarted by German Forces</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, due to the impassable mud of the southern front, there has been little fighting. The Soviets are instead taking advantage of the severe cold to launch offensives on the central and northern fronts. The fighting has been most intense in the Stellaye Rusa area south of Lake Ilmen, where the Soviets attempted to attack from the north and south, but after a German counterattack, the front has not changed. The German High Command announced on the 5th that German forces had shot down 25 Soviet aircraft in this area. It is reported that in the past 14 months, the Soviets have suffered 71,000 dead, 30,000 captured, and have lost 1,300 armored vehicles, 600 heavy artillery pieces, and 5,000 mortars. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet offensive in the Gzhatsk area is to reconnoiter Smolensk, but German forces have deployed reserves to stop the Soviet advance.</p>
<p>Soviet Border Region, (Havas) - Yesterday's Eastern Front situation was characterized by the continued advance of German counteroffensives in the Donets River basin and the frustration of fierce Soviet attacks north and northwest of Kursk. On the Donets River front, Moscow reports that although the Red Army's defenses were breached, they repulsed the Germans at night. Thawing and rain in the Kuban-Azov region continue to impede operations. On the central front, Soviet forces continue to attack, attempting to approach the outer defenses of the important German stronghold of Smolensk. Another Soviet force is attacking south of Rzhev, its destination appearing to be Vyazma, also an important German stronghold. German forces are strongly resisting on the Zhitrina River, but the Soviets claim to have crossed the river.</p>
<h3>German Preparations Have Been Strengthened; Offensive to Be Launched with Arrival of Summer</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities, regarding the Eastern Front situation, announced on the 5th that German counteroffensive preparations are currently being strengthened, and the situation will become stable. The German army will use this line as a base for a summer offensive on the Eastern Front. Heavy rain has been falling for days on the southern front, and the movement of Soviet mechanized units on the central front has been hindered by mud, giving the German army an opportunity to counterattack. The German army now has a considerable advantage on the southern front. Also, on the northern front, the temperature is -7 to -11 degrees Celsius, but the fighting on this front has come to an end. Therefore, from its current position, it is awaiting a spring offensive. At present, from northwest of Leningrad to Stellaye Rusa, west of Upper Rzhev, via Vyazma to west of Orel-Kursk, along west of Kharkov to Taganrog, the Soviet winter counteroffensive has come to an end. Future developments will depend on the German summer offensive.</p>
<h3>Soviets Appear to Be Shifting from Kursk toward Kiev</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front news, the German army has achieved great victories for days. The approximately 250-kilometer front from Izyum to Voroshilovgrad and the left bank of the Donets River is now entirely in German hands. Also, the Soviet 3rd Tank Army has recently been encircled by German forces in the Krasnograd region south of Kharkov. Therefore, the Soviet attempt to recapture Ukraine has completely failed. Also, according to German frontline news, German forces secured several river crossings on the Donets River on the 5th, and vanguard units have advanced to the right bank of the river, engaging in fierce fighting with Soviet forces. Currently, the Soviets are only counterattacking on the Mius River front and have abandoned their attempt to advance from the Donets Basin toward Ukraine, and appear to be advancing from Kharkov along Kursk toward Kiev. Also, German news agency frontline reports that Soviet forces are currently massing troops in the Kupyansk area, attempting to attack Rykov west of Kursk, and that large-scale mechanized battles are now underway in the area.</p>

<h3>International Commentary on Establishment of Finnish Cabinet</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated that the newly established Finnish Cabinet can truly be described as a major compromise among the country's various political parties. The Swedish People's Party of Finland occupies two key positions, namely Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior. Of the 16 members of the new Finnish Cabinet, the Social Democratic Party accounts for five, the Agrarian Party for four, the Conservative Party for two, the Swedish People's Party for two, and the Liberal Party for one. There are also two seats occupied by non-partisans. Although the new Finnish Prime Minister Linkomies is young, he has long been one of Finland's important politicians, efficient and widely regarded by the people. The new Foreign Minister Ramsay is also deeply trusted by the Scandinavian countries, as is the new Minister of the Interior Elenius. Given the composition of the new Finnish Cabinet as described above, it is widely believed that Finnish policy will not change.</p>
<p>Budapest, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The "Pester Lloyd" stated that when Hungary and Finland jointly fought against the Soviet Union, both felt that they had fulfilled their responsibility to European civilization. Finnish policy will not change due to the change of Cabinet. The newspapers mentioned that the new Finnish Prime Minister recently visited Hungary.</p>
<h3>German Commissioner in the Netherlands Issues Statement; Expresses Optimism About the Future of the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Haiphong News Agency) - The German Administrative Commissioner for the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, issued a statement to the Haiphong News Agency, expressing his deep satisfaction with the loyal attitude of the Dutch people and his optimism about the future of the Netherlands. He stated that since the summer of 1940, the Dutch economy has undergone decisive changes, especially in agriculture. The number of pigs raised in the Netherlands has been greatly reduced due to the interruption of foreign feed sources, and grasslands have been converted into fields to plant feed. After the Dutch industry accepted large German orders, the phenomenon of unemployment has been eliminated. In order for the Netherlands to participate in the European total war, non-essential factories have been shut down. Regarding the political situation in the Netherlands, Seyss-Inquart continued, the number of opposition members in the Dutch people is not large, and the measures taken by the German occupation authorities have been greatly assisted by the people, such as the reorganization of the Dutch People's Service Corps and the expansion of the Dutch Labor Front, which are progressing smoothly. Seyss-Inquart then announced that the Mussert Party will participate in government affairs, stating that highly respected party members of the Netherlands and Germany will assume important positions in the administrative organs, and future Dutch new policies will be consulted with them first. Regarding the Dutch churches, Germany adheres to the principle of non-interference in religious affairs. As for the Jewish question, Jews in official organs have been gradually dismissed, and Jews in the economic and cultural circles have also begun to be excluded. Half of the Dutch Jews have been confined to labor camps. After the Netherlands lost the East Indies, some Dutch people have shifted their investment and work targets to the German-occupied areas of Eastern Europe. 600 Dutch volunteers fighting on the Eastern Front have died gloriously. Finally, he refuted rumors that the enemy propaganda organs claimed that Germany intends to relocate one-third of the Dutch people to the eastern provinces, stating that it is purely fabricated.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States' Intense Open and Covert Struggle to Control Iran: American Advisors Spread Throughout Iranian Agencies, Iranian Financial Delegation Goes to the United States for Assistance</h3>
<p>Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The clash of interests between Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran is a well-known fact. However, the conflict of interests between Britain and the United States has not yet received much attention. Britain's interests in Persia (present-day Iran) have a long history. As early as 1889, a Mr. Reuters of the United States obtained the right to establish the Bank of Persia. In 1901, a Mr. D'Arcy of Britain acquired the rights to exploit oil fields covering 500,000 square miles for only 5,000 pounds. This is the so-called Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with most of its shares owned by the British government. Since the end of the last World War, Britain has attempted to consolidate its position in Persia. However, the nationalist movement in the country, under the leadership of King Pahlavi, gradually expanded. Subsequently, in 1919, Persia announced the cancellation of unequal treaties, while also liaising with the Soviet Union for support and using the League of Nations as a shield. Recently, it has leaned towards the United States, seeking its assistance. In 1933, D'Arcy's oil concession was eventually ordered to be canceled by the Iranian government. Britain and Iran then concluded a new treaty stipulating that the British oil company could continue to exploit oil for 60 years. Since then, American capital has gradually penetrated the Persian Gulf. The American Gulf Company has obtained vast oil fields in the Kuwait region, and the California Arabian Oil Company has also obtained oil exploitation rights for 249,000 square miles in the Al-Hasa region of Arabia. Later, the United States also obtained oil rights in Bahrain, although managed by the Canadian Bahrain Oil Company, the capital is entirely owned by Americans. Subsequently, American influence extended into the British sphere of influence. In 1937, American oil merchants also concluded an oil exploitation agreement for eastern Iran with Iran. Looking at the recent actions of the American military in Iran, one can get a glimpse of the friction between British and American interests. For example, key strategic points such as Bandar Abbas and Bandar Shahpur are garrisoned by American troops, and American advisors are spread throughout Iranian agencies. The American government is now trying to control Iran's finances. It has already dispatched four advisors to supervise financial affairs and is further expanding the personnel of its consulates in Iran and Arabia. Recently, President Roosevelt presented a wireless radio and a magnificent car to King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, which, although not a major event, is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) - Iranian domestic affairs have fallen into an extremely chaotic state due to the competition among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to expand their influence within the country, as well as the increasingly serious food panic. The Soheili cabinet, which was established less than a month ago, is also facing the crisis of dissolution. Britain is deeply embarrassed by the United States' active expansion of influence in Iran. Britain had used the pro-British faction in Iran to overthrow the previous Qavam cabinet and have Soheili succeed as prime minister. However, it is not something that can be achieved overnight to eliminate the American forces that have deeply penetrated Iranian domestic affairs. Therefore, Soheili cannot but follow the opinions of the American side. The United States is even pushing the Iranian parliament to criticize the harsh demands of the British and Soviet troops stationed in Iran. The British and Soviet ambassadors to Iran have lodged protests with the Iranian government, similar to threats, saying that if the Iranian parliament does not change this unstable attitude, they will resolutely deal with it with appropriate measures. Furthermore, the seriousness of the Iranian food panic has reached its peak. It is impossible to buy better food even on the black market. Residents have been forced to the brink of starvation. It is reported that in recent days, there have been incidents of rice looting in Iran.</p>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources in Tehran, an Iranian financial delegation will go to the United States to request American financial assistance and preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - Tehran Radio announced that due to the opening of new oil wells, the output of oil mines in southern Iran in 1942 increased by 10% compared to 1941.</p>
<h3>Mayor of Rangoon Delivers Speech: City Gradually Reviving One Year After Capture</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Today marks the one-year anniversary of the Japanese army's capture of Rangoon. Mayor U Laway made a speech stating: "When the Japanese army entered the city, the population of Rangoon was extremely small, probably less than 20,000. Although not many houses were burned down, most of the buildings in the commercial center were lost. At that time, Rangoon was in a state of desolation. Later, residents gradually returned. By mid-April, the city had 100,000 people. After that, the Japanese army cooperated in forming the Rangoon Public Security Maintenance Association. The Japanese authorities also provided a large amount of funding to restore essential urban services such as city markets, water supply, and automobile transportation. In June, an administrative committee was organized. The committee established civil and criminal trials and adopted a universal civil administration policy throughout Burma. In September, the Rangoon City System was announced, and the municipal government fully inherited the affairs of the Public Security Maintenance Association. In this way, Rangoon gradually revived. By the end of October, the population had increased to 400,000, and the lives of the citizens were almost back to normal. The organizations necessary for municipal administration and the general public have also been established. Since last December, the British and American air forces in India have repeatedly carried out inhumane blind bombings to hinder the revival of Rangoon. However, the Rangoon municipal administration and the administrative organization of the entire Burmese territory continue to operate. Because the Japanese government has declared the construction of the Burmese nation, there is no doubt that these activities will have an effect."</p>
<h3>The British Empire in Wartime Economic Distress (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Long Fei</p>
<p>(1) The Slow Pace of Military Production Increase</p>
<p>Britain's wartime economy has been implementing the Military Industry Control Law since 1936. However, it was only recently that the British government truly implemented a total mobilization posture. For example, in the initial stages of the war, the transformation of peaceful industries to military production was only subject to restrictions on the allocation of raw materials. The main focus was to encourage them to automatically shift from peaceful industries to military industries. Of course, this lenient measure was not in line with the needs of the war. Therefore, in 1941, it had to adopt an organizational policy, launching the coercive power of the state to transform non-essential and peacetime industries into military industries and implement a total mobilization of labor.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill once described the three stages of British wartime production, saying that the second year of the war was the stage of "very little," the third year was the stage of "a lot," and the fourth year was the stage of "doing whatever one wants."</p>
<p>However, since the start of the European war, Britain has already passed the fourth year of the war, and Britain has been reorganizing its military for five years. However, its production status has not yet reached the stage of "doing whatever one wants." It is still questionable whether the stage of "a lot" has been reached.</p>
<p>German Aviation Minister Göring's cry, "Guns are more important than butter," was in 1936. At that time, Britain had an absolute sense of superiority over Germany's "poverty."</p>
<p>It was precisely because Britain had this sense of superiority that the establishment of its wartime production mechanism was delayed in invisible ways. No matter how hard Britain tried later, the British wartime production system ultimately had an irremediable backwardness. Even with the combined efforts of Britain and its autonomous territories, it could not catch up with and surpass Germany's military production capacity.</p>
<p>Looking at aircraft, due to the backwardness of maintenance, the current first-line aircraft number only about 10,000. According to a recent American magazine, Germany's monthly production is 3,000 aircraft, while Britain's is only 2,400, which is only four-fifths of Germany's production. Of course, if the production of both Britain and the United States is combined, it may exceed the production of the Axis powers. However, as far as Britain alone is concerned, even American magazines say that it cannot catch up with Germany. Therefore, Britain's aircraft production is only about 80% of Germany's production.</p>
<p>As for shipbuilding, the British naval authorities have recently been lamenting the poor results of shipbuilding plans. Since the start of the war, British shipyards have been busy with the conversion of merchant ships, warships, and repairs, which has consumed half of the shipbuilding capacity, significantly hindering the planning of new ships. Britain recently adopted the American Liberty-type cargo ship and confirmed a construction plan for standard ships of 11,700 tons. From the laying of the keel to completion, the project is scheduled to take six months, which is much longer than the average of two months or so for the American Liberty ship construction process. The losses since the start of the war have been significant.</p>
<p>(Appendix 1) Number of Ships Lost by Britain Since the Start of the War</p>
<p>—Based on the British Admiralty's Announcement—, Britain mobilized all the shipbuilding workers and British Minister of Labor Bevin once said that in the past fifteen years, all the staff engaged in shipbuilding have been working hard to expand shipbuilding capacity. Therefore, it is not easy to demand a rapid increase in production under the bombing of the German air force. Before the war, Britain's shipbuilding capacity was about 300,000 to 400,000 tons per month, and recently it has been roughly 500,000 to 600,000 tons, which cannot fully meet the increasing needs.</p>
<p>(2) The Deepening of Labor Shortage</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Britain's fate is closely linked to ships. Britain's wartime economy is indeed in a very difficult state due to the increase in ship losses. However, what has a greater impact than the shortage of ships and what will become a dangerous signal for Britain's war of resistance economy is the serious problem of the deepening labor shortage.</p>
<p>Britain's labor shortage is not a recent problem. However, it has only recently developed to a deeply disturbing stage. This can be proven by looking at the speech made by British Minister of Labor Bevin in Liverpool on June 28, 1942. He said: "Britain has withdrawn a large amount of labor from industrial sectors other than military industries, and now it has to recruit young people and teenagers from military industries to be transferred to the battlefield. All industrial sectors must have the awareness of large-scale recruitment. In military industries, female employees will have to be used to make up for the shortage."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, Britain has been doing its best to replenish and strengthen its military strength due to its defeats. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the battlefield has expanded to the East Asia region. For this new situation, Britain has to mobilize a large number of troops in West Asia and Egypt. It is naturally easy to imagine that Britain's source of labor is suffering from rapid pressure. However, the number of soldiers has been reduced due to defeats, resulting in a gradual increase in the threat from the Axis powers. Therefore, more troops have to be mobilized to make up for the losses. However, Britain's population is only 40 million, and the poor source of labor is naturally close to exhaustion. However, as Minister of Labor Bevin said, what is most noteworthy is the large-scale mobilization of laborers in military factories.</p>
<p>Shortly after his speech in Liverpool, Minister of Labor Bevin announced on July 8, 1942, that in order to make up for the domestic labor shortage, the age of recruiting women would be raised to 45 years old, and women born in 1900 would be conscripted starting on July 11. Bevin's declaration in the House of Commons on May 21 last year that Britain's labor shortage had reached a universal and profound stage further clarifies the extent of the labor shortage. He said that out of 33 million British nationals aged 14 to 55, more than 22 million had been mobilized in the military, civil defense, and military-related production sectors. The population engaged in military-related activities accounted for two-thirds of the total population, which can be said to be breaking the world record. Furthermore, according to the announcement made by Finance Minister Wood last May, the government has established a special committee to recruit employees from banks, exchanges, and insurance companies to seek the maximum degree of recruitment, which can also be seen from the side that Britain's labor shortage is deepening.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate labor in essential industries, there is a severe shortage of coal miners and workers in the cotton and wool industries. As a result, coal production has plummeted, and the cotton products necessary for military supplies are extremely insufficient. It is necessary to withdraw a considerable amount of labor from military industries to the coal and cotton industries. In this way, not only is the non-military industry severely oppressed, but also the boundaries that should adapt to military needs are broken, creating a great panic in labor and causing political and economic crises. The unreasonable use of women and child labor, as well as the extension of working hours, is unavoidable.</p>
<p>The mobilization of female labor is being implemented universally based on the decree of December 19, 1942. Currently, two-fifths of the employees in British aircraft factories are women, and 90% of the 30,000 employees in ammunition factories are also women. However, the age for conscripting women was under 25 years old in April 1941, expanded to 30 years old in March 1942, and further raised to 45 years old in July. Furthermore, according to the emergency decree of December 23, 1941, the government decided to permit the use of juvenile workers under the age of 15 and permitted the extension of weekly working hours to 52 hours. Needless to say, this shortage of labor will inevitably promote Britain's crisis.</p>
<p>The control of British industry and labor is carried out by the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of Labor. Due to the mutual competition for priority among the departments related to military supplies, due to the solid political position of capitalists on the one hand, and the fact that trade unions still have the right to collective bargaining and hold the right to strike and also have a force that cannot be ignored, the contradiction of the old system of liberalism has not been cleared. As a result, Britain's industrial mobilization cannot be perfectly achieved. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Most Fierce Battle Occurs in Eastern Cape Serrat: Part of British Troops Surrounded by Germans: Street Fighting in Mateur in Progress</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Domei News Agency) According to a report from Berlin, the troops under German General Arnim attacked in northern Tunisia on Thursday and drove back the troops under General Anderson. They are currently fighting in Cape Serrat (about 70 kilometers west of Bizerte). A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from General Eisenhower's headquarters last night that the most fierce fighting took place along a line starting from the coast six miles east of Cape Serrat and heading south through Sedjenane. Sedjenane is about 20 kilometers south of the coast and 40 kilometers west of Mateur. After a part of the German army surrounded the British troops in the area, street fighting is now in progress. As for the situation to the south, the British claimed to have controlled about 15 kilometers of a highway northeast of Béja (about 100 kilometers west of Tunis). British artillery in the area bombarded the German army on the high ground northeast of Medjez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis) yesterday. The German army attacked the city on Thursday, and an infantry ambush battle broke out in the suburbs. The Reuters dispatch also stated that the German army took the lead in the entire northern offensive with infantry, and used fewer tanks. As for central and southern Tunisia, no important battles were reported last night. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces continued to attack British troops and British ships.</p>

In the far north of Tunisia, the Axis forces launched a decisive attack on Béja, but were blocked in the town of Sedjenane (12 miles from the north coast of Tunisia and 25 miles west of Mateur, located on the railway from Mateur to the coastal city of Tabarka). Street fighting is currently underway. The German army's three consecutive assaults were repelled, and many German tanks were lost. In central Tunisia, the Anglo-American Allied Forces made no progress, only consolidating the recently captured positions. In the Gafsa area, the Anglo-American Allied Forces withdrew their right wing from Gafsa, which was occupied by the Axis forces, and entrusted the guarding to the French breakaway troops. It is reported that the breakaway troops are commanded by General Juin. The general headquarters' battle report today stated that two strongholds in the Kasserine area were captured. Nefta, on the western border of Chott el Jerid, is also in the hands of General Juin's troops. The air forces of both sides were extremely active in the skies over Tunisia today. German Stuka dive bombers bombed and strafed enemy stations, while British and American aircraft bombed Axis land convoys and Axis merchant ships between Sicily and Tunisia.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese Economic Advancement in Various Southern Regions: Aiding Local Financial Institutions for Independent and Healthy Development</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Southern regions were once the site of fierce battles, but they were quickly pacified by the Japanese army. In the year since, there has been rapid progress in the restoration of peace and order, and the revival of the economy, which is worthy of close attention. Speaking of the advancement of economic policies in the South, particularly in the areas of finance, there has been exceptionally smooth progress. To complete the Greater East Asia War, the financial policies of the South naturally aim to strengthen war capabilities and establish an independent financial system on the ground. Financial funds are raised locally, and their expenditure prioritizes the development of key enterprises to advance strategic points. In terms of finance, the organizational structure is independent from that of Japan, so each region, along with the military, actively works to establish financial organizations. As for the currency currently circulating in the South, a dual system is adopted, with military scrip and existing currencies circulating simultaneously and maintaining parity. This measure is being implemented very smoothly throughout the South. To prevent the original currency from being devalued against the military scrip, the current situation will continue to be maintained. This is crucial for stabilizing the currency. The current amount of currency in circulation is roughly the same as before the war, so there is no possibility of inflation. It is particularly noteworthy that there is no established exchange rate between the local currencies and the Japanese domestic currency or foreign currencies, nor is there any exchange between the local currencies. Therefore, trade between the South and Japan is carried out using funds from Japan's temporary military expenditures, and the Southern Development Bank implements this according to its financial system. This is the current situation of currency and trade in the South. Concrete studies are underway regarding future countermeasures. The major financial institutions in the Southern region are now managed by Japanese financial institutions. Enemy banks, which controlled all financial guidance in the South before the war, have now been completely replaced by Japanese financial institutions. As a result, these institutions are actively establishing branches and offices in various locations to meet current needs. The main financial institutions, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, and the Southern Development Bank, have established over eighty branches and offices in the South, three times the number before the war. In addition, non-enemy banks that were temporarily suspended during the war have now been restored. Larger ones include seven Chinese commercial banks and three Indian commercial banks in Malaya, one national bank in the Philippines, and the People's Bank and government pawnshops in Java. To meet the necessary needs, the complete restoration of Japanese finance is being pursued, while also aiming for its development. The People's Bank plays a particularly important role in the financial policies of the region. To stabilize people's livelihoods, promote agriculture, and eliminate high-interest finance of the past, these People's Banks are adopting measures such as implementing interest rate limits to benefit the general public, while also reducing interest rates on government pawnshops. All of these measures aim for the smooth operation of civilian finance in the military and administrative areas of the South. Therefore, military and administrative funds are invested in People's Banks, and these banks are actively established and strengthened, which is also a testament to the implementation of this policy. As for the Southern regions outside the military and administrative scope, such as Vietnam and Thailand, efforts are also being made to complete the cooperation system with Japan. Material exchange between Japan and Thailand is proceeding smoothly. Thailand declared war on England and America, causing its funds in England to be illegally frozen by the English. Japan loaned a large sum of money to increase its financial foundation. Since the establishment of the Central Bank of Thailand, it has been actively expanding its scope of activities in areas such as increased production and finance, thus enhancing its cooperation with Japan in food supply. Clearance between the two countries is done in yen, and Thailand is a part of the Greater East Asia financial sphere. Its future development is highly anticipated. The situation is similar in Vietnam. This year, due to the floods in Thailand last year, it is hoped that Vietnam can enhance its cooperation. Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, agreements have been quickly established between Japan and Vietnam, not only in terms of materials but also, to adapt to the situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the yen is used as the unit for bilateral settlement, to unify various payment systems. Thus, the Southern regions implementing military administration, as well as Thailand and Vietnam, can each stand in their position as part of the Greater East Asia material mobilization sphere and the Greater East Asia financial sphere, and devote their full efforts to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Admiral Nomura Visits the Philippines for Inspection</h3>
<p>Manila, 6th (Domei News Agency) – It was disclosed today that Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, arrived here on March 2nd to observe the progress of the Philippine reconstruction efforts. Admiral Nomura has already inspected Corregidor Fortress and Cavite Port, which were the scenes of battles last year. This afternoon, he addressed Japanese military and administrative officials, and then met with reporters, explaining that the Japanese people have always supported the independence of the Philippines, even when the islands were under American rule. He went on to state that he went to the United States for negotiations to seek a peaceful solution to the Pacific problem, but it was unsuccessful due to the stubborn attitude of the United States. Ambassador Nomura concluded by saying that what impressed him most about the Philippines was the close and sincere cooperation that exists between the Japanese and the Filipinos, even though the Philippines had been involved in the war.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, recently returned here after a two-week inspection of Taiwan and the Philippines. He said that Philippine leaders are working hard to quickly restore their country, and the Philippines has now returned to the embrace of East Asia. The speed of its reconstruction is amazing. The current situation in Manila can accurately estimate the reconstruction of the Philippines. When he visited Corregidor, he saw that the island's defenses were convenient enough to hold 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers, which made him even more grateful to the Japanese army for capturing the island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Solomon Islands</h3>
<p>Riki Pen, 6th (Domei News Agency) – According to Washington, the US Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft continued to bomb US military positions on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on the nights of March 3rd and 4th.</p>
<h3>Japan Approves Exchange Notices in Various Parts of Malaya</h3>
<p>Zhaonan, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Zhaonan Military Administration Department announced today that in order to promote small-scale trade among residents of various parts of the South, it has now approved exchange transactions between Malaya, Sumatra, Burma, Java, and North Borneo, and has stipulated regulations for managing exchange transactions by military administration order on the 2nd of this month, which will be implemented from the 15th of this month. It is said that the regulations for managing exchange transactions were revised to prevent speculation, and all exchange transactions are subject to the permission of the military administration director. At the same time, these exchange transactions are concentrated in banks, and the surplus generated by these exchange transactions is centrally managed by the Malaya branch of the Southern Development Bank, that is, the Southern Development Bank acts as the central bank for exchange transactions, and is also a central agency for exchange transactions in the South, so that exchange and trade can be operated in a planned manner. In the past, various regions in the South could only conduct large-scale transactions based on temporary military expenditures, but now that exchange has been permitted, even civilians can carry out small-scale material exchanges, which is very convenient for local residents. It is expected that the exchange of materials between various parts of the South will become smoother in the future.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Raising War Bonds in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>Excessive issuance cannot be absorbed, leading to a vicious cycle of inflation.</p>
<p>The amount of war bonds issued by the Chongqing regime in recent years is quite astonishing. As of July of the 31st year of the Republic, there were as many as twelve types of bonds issued, totaling over 1 million million yuan. At the beginning of the 31st year, the War Bonds Solicitation Committee was still soliciting for the 29th year's Construction Gold Bonds and Military Supplies Bonds. According to the committee's announcement of the amount raised in the 30th year, the total amount subscribed by provinces and cities domestically was 438,670,000+ yuan, and the amount reported received was 157,160,000+ yuan. Considering that the total amount of bonds issued in the 29th year reached 1.974 billion yuan, the amount subscribed by various regions accounts for only a little over one-fifth of the total issuance. If we further consider the amount reported received, it is less than one-tenth of the total issuance. The war bonds issued in previous years that were actually printed into bond certificates, sold to the public, and circulated in the market were only three types: National Salvation Bonds, National Defense Bonds, and Gold Bonds. Even for these three types of bonds, they either failed to circulate widely or were limited to only a few coastal areas. As a result, bond sales were limited, but the need for funds was urgent, and printing was difficult. Therefore, most of the bonds were given to the "Four Banks" in the form of "General Subscription Certificates" as collateral; then, the "Four Banks" lent money to the government and charged 7% interest. However, the financial resources of the banks were limited, and the large portion that they could not absorb (about 70% or more) was covered by issuing new banknotes to provide loans to the government. Therefore, after the issuance of bonds, due to the free purchase system, it was neither possible to truly achieve the "those with money contribute money" stage, nor was it possible to promote large-scale sales to absorb floating capital.</p>
<p>The wartime expenses were huge, and the issuance of more banknotes was an unavoidable way to raise funds. However, with the increased issuance of banknotes and the government's massive wartime spending, the purchasing power in society should also expand accordingly. Therefore, an important measure of wartime finance is how to curb this unavoidable expansion of purchasing power. This was the case in England and America after the war. However, the most effective strategy for curbing social purchasing power is the issuance of war bonds. But the issuance of war bonds under the above circumstances, due to the impact of the failure to absorb the bonds, not only does not help the overall premise of curbing purchasing power, but also, under the smoke screen of war bonds, it embarks on a vicious cycle of inflation. Chongqing's past bond policy fell into this misguided path. As a result, the burden was unfair, it was not sustainable in the long term, the method cannot be described as stable, and ultimately led to the excessive issuance of currency, the abundance of floating capital, high prices, the decline of productive enterprises, and drastic changes in the distribution of social income. This will be described in detail in the following sections:</p>
<p>(1) Excessive currency issuance: Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, silver is no longer in circulation, and all transactions are based on legal tender. At the time of the "July 7th" Incident, the amount of legal tender issued was only 1.44 billion+ yuan, which was perhaps insufficient for the vast territory and large population of China, and there had never been an excessive need for currency. After the outbreak of the war, wartime expenses were huge, and the financial needs of the government increased sharply. Moreover, the peacetime tax system was not sound, and the effect of increasing taxes to raise funds was not significant. Therefore, the convenient method was to resort to issuing bonds and banknotes. The issuance of banknotes exceeded the limit, which directly contributed to inflation, and the bond policy, due to the inability of society to absorb the bonds, failed to recover the newly issued banknotes, and instead became a disguised form of issuing new banknotes, further pushing the currency into inflation. As a result, exchange rates soared, prices soared, and all the signs of excessive currency issuance appeared in economic phenomena. However, the exact figures for the current amount of currency in circulation are unknown because the government has not announced them. Only Mr. Li Deyin's article "Currency, Materials, and Prices," published in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on May 7, made a rough estimate based on the records of 32 banks, and found that the currency circulation index in the 30th year of the Republic was about 12 times higher than before the war, that is, the currency circulation in the 30th year of the Republic was about 17.2 billion+ yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Abundance of floating capital: Since the currency has been massively increased, the purchasing power of society has expanded. Moreover, because war bonds have not been raised properly in the past five years, the increased banknotes have not been recovered, and social purchasing power has not been curbed. Therefore, the abundance of floating capital is an inevitable result. According to private estimates, this floating capital is estimated at over 50 billion yuan in national currency, which is truly alarming. However, the abundance of floating capital leads to rampant speculation, soaring prices, and also shakes foreign exchange, disrupts finance, and hinders production, which is extremely harmful.</p>
<p>(3) Soaring prices: As the currency is excessively issued, the value of the currency declines daily, and prices rise in inverse proportion. Although price increases are not entirely the result of currency depreciation, factors such as wartime transportation difficulties, material shortages, and rampant speculation also have a direct and indirect impact. However, the depreciation of the currency is the main factor. Except for the price of food in Sichuan and other places in the 27th year of the Republic, which once fell below the pre-war level, the prices of various goods in various parts of the country have risen, and the increase has been unprecedented. Kunming has the highest price increase, and Xining has the lowest price increase, but it is also several times higher than before the war. The average price of goods in other cities is about 30 to 40 times higher than before the war. The high increase in wartime prices cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(4) Decline of productive enterprises: Due to the abundance of floating capital, the national financial system is in an unstable state. To preserve its vitality, floating capital is mostly kept in banks in a semi-fluid state, in the form of current or short-term deposits. Therefore, when floating capital gathers, it causes the financial market to have too much money, resulting in financial congestion; and when floating capital flees, it causes the financial market to suddenly decrease, resulting in anemia, illiquidity, and panic. Therefore, current banks do not dare to make relatively long-term productive investments. Moreover, due to the impact of the war, the "fear and panic" mentality of bankers is particularly strong, and it is not easy to find sufficiently satisfactory and reliable productive investment targets. Moreover, because commercial profits are particularly high, they all invest in commercial operations. Even if a small amount of industrial capital flows in, it is mostly used to hoard raw materials to engage in temporary commercial activities. Therefore, those who are truly engaged in the development of productive enterprises, except for a few state-owned institutions, are rare.</p>
<p>(5) Drastic changes in the distribution of social income: The value of the currency is falling day by day, prices have been rising for a long time, and the trend of hoarding and speculation is in full swing. As a result, the distribution of income among social classes before and after the war is vastly different. Even those who were rich before the war may have become poor, and those who were poor before the war may have become rich. It is a great pity that things have changed so much. Mr. Gu Chunfan's article "Estimates of Wartime Burden and Income Distribution," published in the Guilin Ta Kung Pao on November 2, describes this point in detail, roughly saying:</p>
<p>Because of the increase in prices, the income of a small part of the society (about 14%, referring to merchants, industrialists hoarding raw materials, and landlords) has greatly increased. Before the war, their income was 14% of the total social income, while now it is 40%.</p>
<p>The income of other people (about 86%, referring to the rich, middle peasants, poor peasants, tenant farmers, salaried workers, and others with fixed incomes), which was originally 86% of the total social income, has now been reduced to 60%.</p>
<p>This conclusion is based on conjecture and is bound to be criticized for being crude, but judging from the reality of today, it is roughly correct. As a result of rising prices, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened, the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. On the asphalt roads of the metropolis, it is common to see handsome young men with a girl in one arm and a gold dragon in the other, while those who are unclothed and unfed in the small streets and alleys are also numerous. This is a deformed and pathological phenomenon in the wartime economy, and if it continues, it will inevitably cause endless harm. (Sent January 10, 32nd year of the Republic)</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Public Works Decides to Adopt a Policy of Heavy Fines for Illegal Shops: The Heaviest Fine Has Been 150,000 Yuan; Stricter Penalties Will Be Implemented in the Future</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Bureau of Public Works announced that the Bureau, in accordance with the statement of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Okazaki Katsuo (see the newspapers of February 19 for details), will continue to implement a policy of heavy fines for shops that violate the price control regulations. The table below shows the situation of heavier penalties recently imposed by the Bureau on shops that violate the regulations.</p>
<p>Penalty Rules for Violations</p>
<p>According to the Bureau's implementation of the price control regulations, any shop found to have violated, assisted in violating, or attempted to violate these regulations will be subject to one or more of the following penalties: (1) withholding or revoking the license; (2) ordering the shop to suspend business for a period of time; (3) refusing to grant various conveniences from the Bureau's controlled goods office; (4) confiscating goods equivalent in value to the stipulated amount of the fine.</p>
<p>No More Tolerance</p>
<p>The Bureau may, at its discretion, order the violating shop to pay a fine in lieu of the above penalties. Up to now, the Bureau has been very lenient in imposing penalties on shops that violate the regulations, but stricter penalties will be imposed in the future. It is hoped that merchants and residents will cooperate with the Bureau, abide by the regulations, and not test the law with their own bodies, which is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Residence Permit for the City Area</p>
<p>Application Deadline</p>
<p>Since the City Police Bureau was ordered to issue residence permits within the boundary on August 15 of last year, most of them have been issued. There are still some people who are in the process of applying. It has been ordered that all police stations must complete the application procedures by the end of this month. The police sub-bureaus, because of the larger scope, must collect the applications from each police station and submit them to the household registration section of the main bureau for review. Therefore, the deadline is the end of June of this year. It has been notified to all police sub-bureaus to instruct each police station to follow the instructions. Residents of the city area must also go to their respective police sub-bureaus or police stations to complete the application procedures within the above-mentioned deadline. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<p>The Opinion of the Authorities</p>
<p>Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works, regarding the issue of suppressing the rising prices, said that in order to suppress the soaring prices, it is necessary to explore the reasons and consider the aspects of goods and currency. However, the self-restraint of merchants and the cooperation of the people with the authorities are crucial to solving this problem. For the above reasons, the authorities are still cautious about implementing repressive control measures, hoping that merchants can self-regulate and self-examine themselves. Unexpectedly, the authorities' tolerant attitude has given unscrupulous merchants and those who dare to violate the regulations an opportunity to illegally profit, which is regrettable. The number of such unscrupulous merchants is increasing, so the authorities have no choice but to implement strict penalties for those who violate the regulations.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Investigation Institute: Initiated by the United Association of Chinese Factories; Various Investigation Works Will Be Carried Out Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Chinese Factories has been established for more than ten years since its establishment in the 16th year of the Republic. In peacetime, it has paid great attention to the investigation and statistics of industrial and commercial enterprises. Recently, in view of the fact that the industrial and commercial industries have undergone many changes since the war in the 26th year of the Republic,</p>
<p>A Non-Negligible Number of Emerging Enterprises</p>
<p>In recent years, the image of revival has gradually appeared in various places, and new industrial and commercial enterprises have also emerged. Therefore, it was discussed with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to jointly form the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Investigation Institute. The proposal was approved by the Standing Council of the City Chamber of Commerce and ordered to be implemented. Standing Director Jiang Shangda was appointed as the secretary, Wu Huanru as the chief secretary, and Huang Baokang as a committee member. The United Association nominated Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, and Li Zufan as committee members. The six committee members then jointly elected Tian Heqing as a committee member and director of the institute. The institute has four groups: general affairs, compilation, investigation, and statistics. The investigators are concurrently served by the directors of the investigation department of the City Chamber of Commerce. The institute is located within the City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Hoping That All Circles Will Provide Convenience</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, a meeting of all staff members was convened in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce to discuss the implementation methods. Committee Member Wu chaired the meeting and first reported on the history of the organization and establishment of the institute, and explained the importance of investigation and statistical work. Finally, he encouraged all committee members to work hard and persevere to achieve success. Director Tian also delivered a speech, detailing the history of the United Association of Chinese Factories in conducting investigation and statistics. He encouraged all members to have the ambition to succeed, not to be afraid of hard work or difficulties, and to be humble and treat others with respect, so that the predetermined purpose can be achieved. Finally, Committee Member Huang Baokang delivered a speech, reporting on the difficulties encountered in handling the investigation work of the City Chamber of Commerce in the past year, hoping that all members will overcome difficulties and work hard under the guidance of Director Tian. Afterwards, the members expressed their opinions separately and decided to set off separately for investigation starting from the 8th, hoping that all circles will provide assistance and convenience.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Meeting for the Return of Concessions: Minister Tajiri Attended; The Meeting Has Ended and He Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Japanese-language Continental News in this city by Domei News Agency, Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office attended the preliminary meeting for the return of Japanese concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which began in Nanjing on March 1 and lasted for three days. The meeting ended on Thursday, and he has returned to Shanghai to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Students in the Chengdu Area Assist in Maintaining Traffic Again: It Will Be Stopped When the Exercise Is Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The Baojia Department of the Chengdu Area Police Department, in order to promote students' traffic morals and ideological hygiene, began to select students from various schools to perform social services last week, and the results were excellent. However, there are a total of 80 primary and secondary schools in the Chengdu area. Each school sends one senior student and five intermediate students, for a total of six students, totaling more than 400 students. Because it was the beginning of the trial last time, only more than 150 students were sent to the department and assigned to various roads to serve. Therefore, the department has notified the school authorities that when it is held again tomorrow (7th), the number of students must be sent in full in accordance with the regulations, and it is scheduled to arrive at the police department at 8:45 am for assembly, and then be assigned to various roads to perform services until the task is completed at 10:45 am and the team is disbanded. This exercise is scheduled to be held once every Sunday. The exercise will be stopped when the results are satisfactory. This kind of movement is extremely necessary to correct the bad habits of passers-by.</p>
<h3>The Fourteenth Class Graduation Ceremony at the Police Instruction Center: Director Lu Yingxun's Speech - Pay Attention to the Suffering of the People</h3>
<p>Over 150 student police officers of the 14th class of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department and Police Instruction Center held a grand graduation ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 6th) in the auditorium of the center in Yangjiazhai, Pudong. Mayor Chen and Minister of Interior Chen Qun, as well as military advisor Kubawa of a friendly nation, sent representatives to attend. Police Director Lu Ying, Secretary Su Qiutan, Detective Captain Guo Shaoyi, and Pudong Police Chief Gao Yazhai arrived on time. The head of the friendly nation's agency in Pudong, Hattori, and police officials Nishimura and Otake, as well as instructor Sato, also attended. The director of the center, Tao Zhihong, personally greeted them. After a short rest, an inspection ceremony was held at the center's large parade ground, featuring drills in formations, combat drills, Chinese martial arts, bayonet drills, kendo, group drills, and unarmed exercises. The police officers were spirited and moved in orderly steps. After the inspection, the heads of various agencies, guests, and graduating student police officers gathered in the auditorium for the graduation ceremony. The ceremony was conducted with due solemnity. The center's director Tao Zhihong reported on the training process. The representative of the Ministry of Interior presented awards to the top three graduating student police officers. Director Lu presented graduation certificates and awards. Subsequently, representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the Municipal Government, and military advisors from friendly nations, as well as Director Lu and Director Tao, delivered speeches, offering much encouragement. Finally, the student police representative gave a speech, followed by singing the Chinese Police Song. After the ceremony, Director Lu's speech stated, "Today is the graduation ceremony of the 14th class of student police officers at our police instruction center. I am honored to have you all, distinguished officials, here to give us your instructions, and guests from all walks of life to participate. After you graduate, you will be assigned to serve in various places. Now that various places are undergoing reconstruction, there is a great need for the cooperation of the police. We, as police officers, are responsible for maintaining local order and protecting the people. However, we should not just offer empty words, but we need to put that into practice. Today, taking the opportunity of meeting you all, I will briefly say a few words. Now, prices of everything are high, and the cost of living is increasing daily, and the suffering of the people has deepened. Since we bear the responsibility of protecting the people, even if we cannot alleviate the suffering of the people, we must not increase the suffering of the people. This is what I have been constantly mindful of and used to encourage myself for the past five years. You are graduating today and will soon leave this place. I want to bring this up as parting words, hoping you will keep them in mind."</p>
<p>The Jiaxing Branch of the Bank of China: Relocating to Resume Operations Mid-Month</p>
<p>The Jiaxing branch of the Bank of China, which had temporarily moved to Shanghai to conduct business since the incident, has now moved back to Jiaxing from Shanghai and is scheduled to resume operations on March 15 at No. 92 Tangwan Street outside the North Gate. The branch completed the procedures for closing collections and payments in Shanghai yesterday (the 6th).</p>
<h3>The Future "Shanghai Construction Plan" Needs a Fundamental Change: Interview with Director of the Construction Department, Mai Jingming</h3>
<p>Mr. Mai Jingming, the Director of the Urban Construction Department of the Ministry of Construction, has been in Shanghai for several days to inspect the post-war reconstruction. Now that his official duties are completed, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai today and go to Hangzhou to continue his investigation. Our reporter visited Director Mai at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Construction and was honored to hear his impressions of this trip as follows:</p>
<p>Since the National Government joined the war, it has been striving to promote the increase of production related to war effort and the development of production industries. However, it also attaches equal importance to urban construction. Construction is a vast and complex undertaking. To achieve the economic development of the country, the improvement of people's thinking, the raising of cultural standards, the realization of mass welfare, the cultivation of national strength, and the accomplishment of the war effort, we must strive for urban construction. Therefore, after the government joined the war, it established the Ministry of Construction under the Executive Yuan, and a department was specially set up to manage urban construction. I am responsible for this department, and I am aware of my limited ability and fear that I am not up to the task. I hope that all sectors will provide more guidance to correct my shortcomings.</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have been carefully managed by the previous authorities over the years, achieving remarkable results. However, after the incident, many major cities were destroyed by the war. Since the return of the National Government, efforts have been made to restore and rebuild these cities, but due to limitations of time, manpower, and resources, the construction work has not yet reached the expected goals. This time, I was ordered to inspect the major cities and arrived in Shanghai on the first day of this month. In addition to visiting Mayor Chen and relevant authorities, I also inspected various public works. The results were very satisfactory. Although I dare not say that there are any great revival plans, at the very least, (1) it can be used to understand the extent of destruction in various cities after the incident and the degree of restoration that has been done, laying the groundwork for further improvements in the future; (2) it can be used to inquire about the difficulties encountered in the construction of various cities in the past, so that the central and provincial governments can work together to eliminate these obstacles to complete the mission of urban construction.</p>
<p>I have been in Shanghai for several days, and various public works have been inspected in detail. In this special wartime environment, it is still possible to continuously improve and develop, surpassing even the pre-incident times. I deeply admire the efforts of the various authorities. As for the so-called "Greater Shanghai Construction Plan" that existed in Shanghai before the incident, it was planned to develop the current Xanshi Street area, to rival the concessions and gradually shift the prosperity of the Shanghai concessions to that area. Later, due to the Sino-Japanese incident, this plan was interrupted. After the incident, Hengchan Company had a revival plan, with a six-year period and an investment of 100 to 200 million yuan, to transform Shanghai into an ideal great city for China and Japan. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this plan changed with the needs of the times. Now, the concession area will be returned due to various countries' respect for our country's sovereignty. Therefore, the future direction and plan for Shanghai's construction must be fundamentally changed. I will formulate my own opinions based on my inspection and report them to the authorities for reference.</p>
<h3>The Jianghai Customs Sets Up a Post in Wuhu and Establishes a Transshipment Tax Collection Office</h3>
<p>Tanigawa Katsuo, the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has now set up a transshipment tax collection office in Wuhu and established five branch posts at the Wuhu Railway Station, Jiang'an, Dajiangkou, Changhe, and the Parcel Post Office. The collection is officially in operation. All merchants should be aware of this.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Promotes Buddhist Culture: Lecture on "Master Xuanzang" Today</h3>
<p>The ancient Jing'an Temple in our city was built in the Three Kingdoms period of the Eastern Wu Dynasty, with a history of 1500 to 1600 years. Since the abbot, Dharma Master Mijia, took charge last year, he has been determined to rectify the temple affairs and further promote social and cultural education. To understand the Buddhist dynamics and future direction in our city, our reporter visited Dharma Master Mijia at the temple. The Dharma Master expressed his views as follows: Buddhism has been introduced to our country from Tibet since the Eastern Han Dynasty, with a history of two thousand years. Throughout the dynasties, there have been eminent monks who have taught or translated scriptures. Therefore, Buddhism has greatly helped and promoted our country's culture and art. At a time when culture is declining, it is necessary to promote Buddhist culture. Since July last year, our temple has established Buddhist Sunday lectures, inviting eminent monks to serve as lecturers every week. In addition to expounding the essence of Buddhism, the lectures also cover philosophy of life, hygiene, and art. Occasionally, social experts are invited to serve as lecturers. Therefore, although the name is Buddhist lectures, they are actually academic lectures. Since the establishment until today, there have been thirty sessions, and each lecturer is a well-learned scholar. The purpose of establishing the lectures is to integrate Buddhism with society. Recently, our temple asked the Shen Bao Scholarship Committee to select four university students majoring in philosophy, and our temple is responsible for their tuition and miscellaneous fees, which is nothing more than a small contribution to society. The establishment of Jing'an Elementary School and the Japanese Language Institute by our temple is also a contribution to education.</p>
<p>It is also reported that today is the thirtieth session of the Buddhist Sunday lectures, and the abbot of the Jade Buddha Temple, Dharma Master Zhenye, will be the lecturer. The topic is "Master Xuanzang." He will give a detailed exposition on the contributions and influence of Master Xuanzang on Buddhism. All sectors are welcome to attend. The time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Police Authorities Coordinate to Expel Unemployed Hooligans; Those Confirmed to Be Extorting Will Absolutely Not Be Allowed to Stay Within the Boundary</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, the Municipal Police Department, and the Huxi Police Bureau, in addition to making every effort to assist in cracking down on hoarders and profiteers and eliminating unscrupulous merchants in the black market, in order to protect the business of legitimate factories and shops, the lives and property of good people, and to strictly coordinate to prevent unscrupulous elements, dispatched a large number of detectives to the main streets and thoroughfares within their jurisdiction day and night, to search pedestrians and organize patrol teams (including plainclothes detectives) to go to hotels and other public places in the morning and evening to conduct inspections. Anyone who is suspicious will be arrested and interrogated. If it is confirmed that they are unemployed hooligans who live by extortion (based on household registration investigations), they will be immediately deported and absolutely not allowed to stay within the boundary, in order to eliminate unscrupulous elements and maintain the peaceful and prosperous lives of legitimate merchants. At the same time, gatherings and parades are prohibited, unless permitted by the authorities.</p>
<h3>March 8th Women's Day: Women's Organizations Hold Commemorations</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is March 8th, Women's Day. The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association and the Women's Welfare Association will hold gatherings to commemorate the day. The Women's Association will hold a conference at 10:00 AM on that day at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce near the Tianhou Temple Bridge, and will also hold a paper flower charity sale. The proceeds will be used for the benefit of orphans and children in distress. The Women's Welfare Association will hold a Sino-Japanese Women's Symposium at Dake Building at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to discuss the responsibilities that women should bear in the Greater East Asia Holy War.</p>
<h3>Various Shipping Companies Plan to Adjust Transportation Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Shipping Company and other shipping companies plan to readjust the transportation fees for passengers and goods. However, the new adjusted transportation fees must be submitted to the authorities for approval before they can be implemented. It is heard that the impact of the adjusted transportation fees on passengers and merchants is insignificant.</p>
<h3>French Concession February Criminal Case Report: Russian Police Shoot and Kill a Murderer; Bicycle Kills One Person</h3>
<p>In February, there were no cases of murder, kidnapping, or robbery. On April 12, 1939, a Chinese policeman on duty on Avenue Foch was shot in the right thigh while resisting a gun robbery and died of his injuries. The police department has not given up the investigation. On February 19 of this year, one of the murderers in the case was apprehended.</p>
<p>On February 2, on the border of the Nanshi area, a Chinese man was cutting Nanshi police officers with a knife. A nearby Russian officer ordered him to stop. The Chinese man ran away. The Russian police officer, seeing the situation, shot him in the heart and died of his injuries.</p>
<p>In February, there were a total of 79 special theft cases, including 24 cases of burglary over walls, 40 cases of break-ins, and 15 cases of snatch theft. 21 cases were solved, and 14 thieves were arrested, recovering stolen goods worth 3,827 yuan. As for simple theft cases, there were 312 cases (413 in the previous month), of which 105 cases were solved, and 134 thieves were arrested, recovering stolen goods worth 11,3110 yuan.</p>
<p>There were 56 bicycle theft cases (71 in January), and 13 criminals were arrested, recovering 13 bicycles.</p>
<p>There was only one case of a vehicle causing serious injury and death this month. The deceased was a Chinese passerby who was hit by a bicycle and died of his injuries. As for public and entertainment venues, the police department continues to search, question, and verify ID cards as usual. In February, the household registration office attached to each police department issued 18,179 ID cards, registered 13,167 departures, 10,879 arrivals, 1,506 births, and 601 deaths.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes at the Japanese Embassy Office</h3>
<p>According to the Tongmeng News Agency in Shanghai, the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai announced personnel changes on March 3. Mr. Taku, Secretary of the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has been transferred to Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai. Mr. Hasegawa and Mr. Tokunaga, experts from the Patent Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, have been transferred to the Embassy Office. Mr. Matsumura, an investigator at the Embassy Office, has been transferred to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Central District Joint Security Cancels the Self-Defense Night Patrol</h3>
<p>At the end of the lunar new year, the Central District Baojia General Joint Security dispatched 38 members of the Self-Defense Corps every night to patrol the various sections of the district until dawn to assist in maintaining public order. Now that the winter defense is over, it has been cancelled.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Sold Household Flour Yesterday</h3>
<p>The municipal area's household flour for February has been allocated by the Municipal Food Administration. A total of 2.5 catties of flour can be purchased per person, at a fixed price of 5.5 yuan. The Nanshi District started selling it universally yesterday (the 6th). All districts have been instructed to pay for and issue flour from public granaries immediately.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Exhibition Will End Today</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association opened on the fourth floor gallery of the Great World Department Store on the 5th of this month for a period of three days and will end today. Among the exhibits are the formal script edict by Japanese Sugihara Yuzaburo and the cursive script by Zuiun Seisen, as well as the seal script by Chinese Ma Gongyu and Weng Lian, all of which are excellent works. All sectors are welcome to visit for free.</p>
<h3>The Exchange of Materials Between Shanghai and the Mainland Can Proceed Unhindered After the Establishment of the New Unified Control Agency</h3>
<p>During the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Conference on the 5th, Minister of Industry Mei submitted an important proposal regarding the unified control of major materials and the stabilization of prices. The proposal was unanimously approved. The purpose of the proposal is to reorganize the purchase and distribution agencies that have lacked control in the past, establish a unified agency, and organize a central business and industry control group to implement autonomous control. At the same time, various restrictions that have hindered smooth distribution will be eased or abolished. Therefore, it can be said to be a landmark measure. The National Government's new economic policy is not to restore a free economy from a controlled economy, but to supplement the deficiencies of the various control agencies in the past and establish a reasonable and unified agency to promote smooth material procurement and distribution and price stability. Since the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the mainland or peaceful areas has been subject to various restrictions, prices in various places have been quite uneven. If various restrictions hindering reasonable distribution are abolished in accordance with this proposal, prices in various places will be able to maintain equilibrium. It is expected that after the establishment of the procurement and distribution agency, various controls implemented by various government offices will be transferred to the new agency to implement autonomous control. From this, we can see the importance of the new control agency's task. The new control agency must be participated by Chinese and Japanese merchants on an equal footing, supporting each other to facilitate the progress of procurement and distribution.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Superstitious Businesses: The Municipal Area Actively Unfolds Investigative Work; The Second Special District Simultaneously Starts Reporting</h3>
<p>Since the Preparatory Office for Donations on Superstitious Business Items of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau adopted the passive total donation crackdown method for various superstitious businesses in the city, it has actively unfolded the investigation of the categories and amounts of superstitious businesses and items in various districts of the city. Previously, the Nanshi area was divided into ten districts according to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Bureau's various branches, and the investigation began on the 2nd of this month. One person was dispatched to each district to conduct investigations on the categories and amounts of various superstitious businesses in the designated areas. Yesterday (the 6th), the investigation was completed. It is estimated that there are more than 600 superstitious businesses and retailers of superstitious items in the entire district, most of which are incense paper shops that incidentally sell superstitious items. The office is now urging them to go through registration procedures. It is also reported that the office re-divided the Huxi area into four sections yesterday (the 6th): (1) Xujiahui to Hongqiao Road as the boundary; (2) Hongqiao Road to Daxilu; (3) Daxilu to Suzhou River; (4) Westward to the railway as the boundary, and started the investigation. The Second Special District was divided into eight sections and started the investigation work simultaneously. It is understood that the office will issue a public notice within days, limiting the time for superstitious business groups or stores selling superstitious business items in each district to go through registration procedures, otherwise they will be subject to a ban on operations.</p>

<h3>Difficulties for Technical Personnel</h3>
<p>— Chen Xingguo</p>
<p>Finding a job is a difficult task nowadays, but it is even more difficult to integrate labor and capital, especially in this year. Even if one has a skill, it is difficult to find a position. However, because the salary is too low, the income is not enough to cover the expenses, resulting in a tight budget and an unstable life.</p>
<p>According to the employment record of the industrial and social affairs department of the municipal authority in February of this year, factories requested a total of one hundred technical personnel from the department. Among the registered unemployed technical personnel, after careful consideration by the department, only ninety people were deemed eligible for introduction. This situation of demand exceeding supply is sufficient to prove that finding a job is not an extremely difficult thing: among the ninety people introduced, only ten were hired by the factories after the interview. From this, it can be seen that the so-called difficulty in finding a job for ordinary people is because they do not have valuable skills.</p>
<p>Among the unemployed technical personnel registered with the municipal authority, there is a mechanical technician named Zhang who was called five times by the bureau to introduce him to a job, but each time he refused to take the job. He said that rather than working for others for three or four hundred yuan a month (without room and board), he would rather sell fresh fish himself, which would earn him twenty or thirty yuan a day. According to the statistics of the employment department, there are as many as four out of ten people who are unwilling to take a job like Zhang. This phenomenon, rather than pitying them for not using what they have learned, is detrimental to social production, and the loss is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The poor skills of the labor force and the meager treatment of the capital side have caused great damage to industry. Both sides are difficult to shirk their responsibilities and need to be improved urgently. The former needs to strive for perfection, and the latter should try to cultivate talents as much as possible. According to the current situation, the latter needs to reconsider, and should investigate the living conditions of workers at any time and improve the treatment, so that the labor force can work with peace of mind, and its products can naturally tend to be excellent, and the production efficiency can also be increased accordingly. If life can be stabilized, then the prosperity of society is in sight.</p>
<h3>Collection Office Collection and Deposit of Tax Revenue: All Amounts Should Be Transferred to the Treasury.</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, in order to effectively rectify tax revenue in the urban area, noted that while the collection offices in each district have been consistently diligent in collecting taxes and enriching the public treasury, they have not been equally prompt in transferring collected tax revenues to the treasury. This is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, special orders were issued to each collection office, stating that henceforth, all tax revenues collected and deposited must be transferred to the treasury immediately and within a limited time, without any delay. Since the source of gasoline for this city was cut off, most automobiles have ceased operation. Although some use charcoal as a substitute, it is very inconvenient. It is now learned that the relevant authorities are manufacturing compressed gas to supply to thirty automobiles of the Public Works Bureau for trial use. According to the installation of this alternative fuel, it is simpler than charcoal and also cheaper. It is expected that demand will increase sharply.</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau Employment Agency: Seeking Technical Personnel on Behalf of Others</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department Employment Agency is now commissioned by external parties to recruit the following technical personnel: (1) Japanese typists; (2) Typesetters and proofreaders (must be able to typeset in Japanese); (3) Lathe operators, fitters, and other mechanical technicians; (4) Sewing workers; (5) Mechanical draftsmen; (6) Electric motor manufacturers and repairers; (7) Electric meter repairers. Unemployed technical personnel seeking employment, as well as factories seeking talent, are requested to register at Room 362, 4th Floor, Public Works Bureau Building, 180 Fuzhou Road. Job seekers must also submit two 2.5-inch headshots. Registration hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, except Saturday afternoons and Sundays when the office is closed. All registrations are free of charge.</p>
<p>The Qing Fen Hui Cadre Training Institute: Results of the Blockade Class Announced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Qing Fen Hui, in preparation for the second phase of Qingxiang (rural cleansing) work, recruited cadres for various classes some time ago to provide training so they could undertake various Qingxiang tasks. While the Zuo Zhi (support governance), Zheng Gong (political work), and Bao Jia (neighborhood security) classes have already begun training, the Blockade Class was delayed due to the large number of applicants and the need for thorough screening. It is now learned that the association has announced the list of successful candidates for the class, which is scheduled to officially begin training in mid-month.</p>

<h3>Special Edition on the Nanyang Region, Part 5: A Record of Changes in the East Indies (7) By Qiao Song</h3>
<p>After appointing governors and establishing local administrative structures, the Japanese military administration also appointed mayors for all eighteen cities in Java. During the Dutch era, sixteen of the eighteen mayors were Dutch, with only two being native. Under the Japanese, apart from the mayors of Batavia, Surabaya, and Semarang being Japanese, the remaining fifteen mayors were appointed from among the native population.</p>
<p>A central administrative structure has also been established, divided into seven departments and five external bureaus, with the primary emphasis on promoting construction. Special efforts are being made to strengthen the police force. A police academy was opened in June last year to train police officers.</p>
<p>Sumatra has been assigned to the Malayan side, and Celebes has been placed under a separate system. These details will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, offices have been established for managing national treasury funds, tax-related matters, and monopoly enterprises, to ensure fiscal revenue and strive for balanced income and expenditure. Due to the extensive war damage to industry, the military administration is also preparing to provide loans to facilitate recovery. Regarding currency, both the guilder and military scrip remain in circulation. Since June last year, the Bank of Japan, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui Bank, and China South Sea Bank have commenced operations. The Southern Development Gold Mine also began operations in Java on July 1st, expanding the financial network. The Yokohama Specie Bank further established twenty "branch offices" in Java starting from October 20th. The liquidation of enemy banks began in the latter half of October last year. In terms of commodity prices, the policy of reducing prices is being maintained, and orders have been issued to maintain the prices as of January 1, 1942. Despite this, prices still tended to rise, and the military administration promulgated the Price Control Law on October 1st, imposing severe penalties on those who violated the law. Some Arabs and overseas Chinese were subjected to business suspension and property management penalties.</p>
<p>In terms of justice, the military administration promulgated the Military Administration Trial Regulations on April 29th, restoring local courts and other judicial organs. To respect religion, the Islamic High Court and the Monks' Court were also restored. Initially, the inherent status of native judicial officials was recognized. Later, Japanese judicial officials came to Java one after another, establishing a policy of Japanese guidance, reorganizing military administration courts, and establishing a new supreme court. At the same time, military administration courts were given strong jurisdiction over economic crimes, strengthening the economic control of the new Java.</p>
<p>In terms of industry, the Japanese military administration first established a policy of food self-sufficiency, focusing on ensuring supplies to various parts of the south. They worked hard to increase food production in the agriculture of the native population and strived to purchase and stockpile, so that the needs of the local Japanese army could be met locally, and Java would become a food storage for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They also prevented the unemployment of agricultural laborers in various farms and maintained the prices of surplus products. The Military Administration's Industry Department specifically established the "Important Food Management Office" for food crops and the "Agricultural Enterprise Cultivation Management Corporation" for collective agriculture, implementing control. As early as the Japanese occupation, minimum prices were set for rice, and purchases were made. However, due to economic chaos and inconvenient transportation at the beginning, the situation was not good. The authorities mobilized financial institutions such as the Bank of Taiwan to provide loans to rice mills to promote purchases. In early August, the "Important Food Management Office" was established to maintain prices and ensure food self-sufficiency, engaging in the purchase and storage of rice, soybeans, cassava roots, and so on. For large-scale industries such as rubber, quinine, tea, and coffee, the military administration issued control orders, guided production, and maintained prices, handled by the "Agricultural Enterprise Cultivation Management Corporation." The corporation also established branches in Surabaya, Semarang, and other places, gradually expanding its scope of activities. Regarding sugar, for example, it used to be the highest-value agricultural export, but domestic demand was not high. However, the military administration did not restrict its production, and most of the eighty-plus sugar factories have already opened for business.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, it was quite chaotic at the beginning due to the planned destruction by the Dutch East Indies army, but it has gradually recovered. For example, the entire 4,800 kilometers of railways were completely restored within seven months of the occupation. In addition to the express trains between Batavia and Surabaya, coastal line connections have also been completed by the "Land Transportation Bureau." Roads are also gradually being repaired, and bus routes have increased. At the same time, the use of trucks and handcarts has also promoted the exchange of goods between local areas. On the other hand, the military administration has focused on restoring coastal shipping routes, building and operating small ships, and registering and using civilian ships, which has made it possible to solve the transportation problems more smoothly. Transportation between Sumatra and various parts of the South is gradually recovering. As for communication networks, efforts were made to restore them early on, and postal, telegraph, and telephone services have gradually opened up.</p>
<p>In terms of education, the Japanese side, in view of the fact that Java has a population of 50 million, believed that this abundant human resource and the agricultural resources of Java were of great significance in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the past, these indigenous peoples were the targets of Dutch exploitation, and in terms of education, only one-third of the children graduated from elementary schools. Japan adopted a different policy and strived to educate and train this human resource, to improve the quality of labor of these 50 million people. Less than two months after the occupation, on April 29th, Tencho-setsu (the Emperor's Birthday), it announced the restoration of state and public elementary schools that taught in the indigenous languages—Malay, Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. In June, the "Japanese Language Promotion School" in Batavia opened. Soon, Japanese language schools sprang up everywhere. All the male teachers from the island were summoned to Batavia to hold a lecture meeting, and soon female teachers' lecture meetings were also held to prepare to reach the level of one school per village. Secondary schools also opened in September, with the goal of cultivating talented people to build the new Java. To promote technical education, a training center for technicians was opened in August to enable them to learn excellent Japanese technology and create industrial warriors. The most noteworthy points of Java's education in the future are the popularization of Japanese and the respect for Malay. In secondary schools, Japanese is a required subject, and Malay is the main language. However, due to the lack of "academic terms" in Malay, the authorities specially organized a "Malay Language Maintenance Committee" to enrich the Malay vocabulary. The greatest efforts are being made to encourage Japanese, and in addition to opening Japanese language schools, various methods are used to encourage the study of Japanese, resulting in the slogan "Learn Japanese, inherit Japanese culture, and enhance Indonesian culture." The Military Administration Supervisory Department also stipulated promotion regulations, rewarding indigenous officials in the military and military administration-related agencies who had excellent Japanese language skills, and giving language salary increases. As for the education of overseas Chinese, whose population is second only to that of indigenous peoples, the Japanese side also paid attention to it. Elementary schools were first restored in Batavia starting in July last year, and many overseas Chinese schools in various places have also been restored.</p>
<p>In terms of culture, Java had a high level of culture among the countries of Southeast Asia before the Dutch invasion, having been influenced by Chinese and Indian cultures. During the three hundred years of Dutch rule, there were indeed many museums, libraries, botanical gardens, and other sanitary facilities, so it was worthy of the title of cultural center of Southeast Asia. After the Japanese army arrived, they focused on restoring cultural and sanitary facilities to improve people's happiness, especially in the area of health and medical care, and worked hard to expand all facilities.</p>
<p>Regarding newspapers and magazines, Malay has replaced the original Dutch and has risen alongside it. Under the guidance of the Japanese army, six newspapers have been published successively: "The Awakener" in Batavia, "One Light" in Bandung, "Voice of Asia" in Surabaya, "New Light" in Semarang, and "Sunshine" in Cihideung. In the area of overseas Chinese, there is a "Co-prosperity Newspaper" (Batavia) and the Surabaya Overseas Chinese Malay newspaper "Commercial News." (The End)</p>
<h3>Chinese Deaths in This City in January: Pulmonary Tuberculosis Remains the Main Cause; Typhoid Slightly Increased, Malaria Relatively Decreased; Regulations Prohibiting Spitting Have Been Effectively Implemented</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Health Department recently released its work report for January, stating that the incidence of various infectious diseases in January was roughly the same as in December of the previous year. Typhoid fever showed a slight increase, while malaria decreased relatively due to seasonal factors. Diphtheria and meningitis did not increase. The number of patients admitted to Chinese isolation hospitals remained small. There were 2,189 registered Chinese deaths, including 1,189 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, and so on. There were 51 cases of people seeking treatment for rabies at the Health Department. Medical and pharmaceutical affairs at the Bureau's schools continued as usual. Among students in Chinese schools, 1,845 had trachoma. Members were sent to inspect 67 Chinese private schools receiving subsidies. Business at various vegetable markets continued as usual, unaffected by the sharp rise in vegetable prices. Four licensed shops and three vegetable market stalls were prosecuted in court for violating regulations prohibiting spitting, and each was fined 25 yuan. 1,447 pounds of food that did not meet hygiene standards were confiscated and destroyed, and the relevant persons were prosecuted in court and punished separately. Milk production averaged 30.72 pounds per day. The Health Department regularly takes samples of milk produced by various dairies for testing. 20,829 citizens were vaccinated free of charge, a decrease of more than 23,000 compared to December of the previous year and a decrease of more than 37,000 compared to January of the previous year. The reasons for the decrease were: (1) smallpox had almost disappeared; (2) unvaccinated citizens could travel freely within Shanghai without restrictions; (3) mobile vaccination teams from the Health Department did not go to various factories and schools to administer vaccinations. The ban on spitting is being actively promoted. Nearly all charcoal kilns in the district have registered with the Bureau, obtained licenses, and improved their equipment to prevent smoke leakage. However, all charcoal kilns ceased operations after an order was issued by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on January 10th. In view of repeated incidents of citizens being poisoned by eating pufferfish, the Bureau issued a notice reiterating the previous order prohibiting the sale of pufferfish (except in the Hongkou vegetable market). At the same time, it contacted the Shanghai Fish Market to send pufferfish to the Health Department's oil extraction room for destruction. 1,026 corpses were cremated, and 512 were buried.</p>

<h3>Economic Section: Economic Review on the Policy Transition and Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>Japan's announced return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality have gradually taken concrete form, and it is expected to be fully realized in the near future. This policy transition can be described as an epoch-making event in Sino-Japanese relations, and the people of both countries sincerely hope it will proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Japan's new policy is clearly demonstrated in the actions of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. This new policy is not limited to these two items. All political, economic, and cultural departments have epoch-making transformations. However, there are still many people who cannot fundamentally understand the meaning of this transformation, which is truly regrettable. There will also be thorough and decisive reforms in the content of Japan's economic policy towards China, but it would be a great misunderstanding if anyone were to regard this change as a transition from a controlled economy to a free economy. The direction and intention of the original policy remain the same and have not changed. However, the National Government will now implement all economic policies, demonstrating the National Government's creativity and strength. Judging from the current internal and external situation, the essence of economic control is also uniform and unchanging, and there will never be any ambiguous matters.</p>
<p>In fact, the word "transition" is not suitable for observing Japan's policy. Japan's policy should be interpreted as having the two major meanings of growth and development. All current transformations are theoretical developments of Japan's policy since the Konoe Declaration and are the conclusion of strengthening the National Government's policy. Therefore, people in general must recognize that it is not a transition but a fact of growth. As for the controlled economy, it is merely a matter of transferring the control that was originally implemented by the Japanese side to meet wartime needs to the National Government. Therefore, it is completely wrong to see it as a change in wartime control policy. The National Government has its own wartime control policies. Even if there are some differences in the timing of the original control policies, the National Government will certainly follow and apply them, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>At present, people engaged in economic activities in Shanghai and other places do not understand this situation, make reckless guesses, and think that there will be changes in the economy. Everyone is engaged in speculation and engaging in unethical economic activities. This kind of activity is truly a disaster for the country and the people, and it can be said to be digging one's own grave. Economists who want to leave a way out in the future must abide by today's control, recognize its direction, and seek the well-being of the country, society, and individuals. Creating something out of nothing and misleading the country and oneself is the most hateful and should be discarded. The issue of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality is progressing extremely smoothly. The transfer of management of economic controls is also smooth. Japan's policy transition will be completed soon, and economists should clearly understand this trend and engage in legitimate activities. This is what we hope for from Chinese and Japanese economic circles. (Translated by Yun Peng from the March 6th Mainland New Daily)</p>
<h3>Economic Commentary: Future Private Economic Institutions</h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council resolved the other day to make industrial and commercial organizations purely economic institutions, so that they can concentrate on assisting the government in implementing economic policies under the wartime system, especially focusing on stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening economic power.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the responsibility of private economic institutions is twofold: First, to stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, private industrial and commercial organizations should take absolute responsibility and strive to suppress commodity prices and implement management systems to prevent the continued existence of speculation and hoarding. Second, to enhance economic power. Therefore, private industrial and commercial organizations should also take active responsibility and devote themselves to adjusting the supply and demand of goods, and assisting in obtaining production raw materials, especially exchanging them with production raw materials in the interior, to promote the corresponding supply and demand of goods.</p>
<p>This dual responsibility has already fallen on the heads of our private economic circles with the consent of the authorities and the urging of public opinion. Then, industrial and commercial organizations established in the private economic circles should feel that they have an unshirkable responsibility in the future, because the term private economic institutions will no longer be an empty slogan.</p>
<h3>Household Surveys and Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>Wartime economy must focus on control. And the simplest and most direct method of control is to use shopping vouchers to regulate goods and finance. After the First European War, Germany needed more than 100 million marks per day for war expenses. If this 100 million marks of war expenses were taken from the normal national budget income and expenditure, it would certainly be insufficient to balance it. If it were taken from the issuance of public bonds, not only would the amount of debt increase day by day, but the procedures would also be extremely difficult. It would still be better to increase the issuance of paper money. The increase in the issuance of paper money would inevitably lead to more floating capital and create a phenomenon of currency inflation. Prices would rise day by day, and people would not be able to make a living. So what can be done? The clever German economists came up with a simple solution, which is the method of shopping without tickets. What is seen in Shanghai is only rice purchase certificates. In Germany, both millionaires and poor workers are given the same shopping vouchers. Whether it is clothing, food, daily necessities, or everything else needed, there are shopping vouchers. Without shopping vouchers, you cannot buy anything. Therefore, what millionaires can buy is also what the poor can buy. Therefore, in Germany, although the government spends tens of thousands of marks every day, it circulates directly and indirectly throughout the country. And those who get this money have nothing to use it for. Except for paying for the amount within the scope of their shopping, the remaining amount has no other use except to deposit it in the bank. It will inevitably flow back to the national bank. Therefore, the government and the national bank spend tens of thousands every day, and at the same time have tens of thousands in income. Prices also stagnate at official prices and cannot rise. This method is indeed the most ingenious way to manage wartime. But how to adjust production and consumption, and how to reconcile shopping vouchers with population, then one book leads to ten thousand variations, and it is not easy. Our country has never had an accurate household survey, and civil servants lack experience in implementing private economic affairs. If we want to learn from Germany's methods, it will not be easy to see its implementation without actively working hard.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Are Investigating the Prices of Goods in Various Industries to Welcome Stable Prices</h3>
<p>Personnel Are Sent to Check Account Books to Execute Price Limits Seriously</p>
<p>Severe Investigation of Transactions Exceeding Limit Prices</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly suppress prices and crack down on speculation and hoarding, the authorities have distributed food, oil, sugar, and other nine necessities per capita. All markets that contain speculation are ordered to suspend business and wait for improvement. Price limits are also strictly enforced, and the account books of purchases and sales in various industries are checked. Merchants who exceed the price limits are investigated, sealed, and punished according to law. The inspection is very strict. For example, although the prices of goods sold to a store listed in the store's account books do not exceed the price limits, to be cautious, it is also investigated whether the prices match at the store that received the goods. All the employees of the Price Control Office have been mobilized to seriously implement the price limits. Some stores have been investigated, sealed, and suspended from business.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Economic Discussion Meeting Held at the Jinmen Hotel the Other Day</h3>
<p>The East Asia Economic Discussion Meeting's Central China Headquarters, taking the opportunity of the former Xingzhong Company President Togo Shinji's visit to Shanghai, held a Sino-Japanese economic discussion meeting at the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at noon on the 5th. Those who attended included Japan's Yuki Chemical Company Mr. Tamaki Toyosuke and Mr. Sekiguchi Takeo, and China's Chen Binhuo, Yin Zibai, Shen Liangchang, Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lan, and Ting Mokanghou, among other Sino-Japanese celebrities, totaling more than 50 people. The atmosphere during the meeting was exceptionally harmonious, and the meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM. (March 6th Mainland New Daily)</p>

<p>Regarding the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's rationing of cigarettes in Shanghai and nearby areas to eliminate the cigarette black market, the association has been actively preparing and is now largely ready. The pledges of all registered cigarette stores in the city were filled out yesterday by Dada Tung, and the rationing can begin. It is learned that the association will first start rationing cigarettes in the urban area of Shanghai in the shortest possible time, and then carry out rationing in the eight suburban districts of Shanghai. Finally, it will expand to various parts of Huazhong. The rationing prices will of course be calculated according to the cost of various cigarettes.</p>
<h3>Alcohol Factories in This City Encounter Raw Material Difficulties</h3>
<p>Various chemical industries all use alcohol as the only manufacturing raw material, and alcohol itself is extracted from molasses. Shanghai's alcohol factories used to use Javanese molasses as raw material. Currently, due to wartime shipping difficulties, they have switched to using dried sweet potatoes. Although the procedure is slightly more complicated, it is easy to obtain. However, recently, villagers are using dried sweet potatoes as a secondary food source due to food shortages, so they are not transported to Shanghai in large quantities, and prices have also risen sharply. Therefore, it is currently very difficult for alcohol factories in this city to find raw materials.</p>
<h3>Procurement of Large Quantities of Oilseed Raw Materials; Half Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Edible oil is one of the main items of food for the people. Recently, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities are implementing a rationing system and also seeking to increase supplies. They have collected a large amount of soybean raw materials, totaling 50,000 tons, from various areas and transported them to Shanghai for the use of various oil pressing factories. Half of them have already arrived at the port, and the rest are being transported continuously. Several tens of thousands of tons of rapeseed and cottonseed are also being purchased, so the supply of oil is expected to increase considerably in the future. As for the selling date of the per capita oil, the authorities need to carefully consider the quantity, so the rationing tickets have not yet been issued.</p>
<h3>Foreign Economic News</h3>
<p>Germany has Sufficient Glass Inventory</p>
<p>It is claimed here that the inventory made by German glass factories is very rich and sufficient to cope with all the urgent needs after the air raids. It can produce 50 million square meters of glass every year. A large machine can produce 6,000 square meters a day. The broken glass after the air raid is taken back and remade, so there is no need to worry about the shortage of glass supply.</p>
<p>France's Remedy for the Oil Shortage</p>
<p>Since France's source of fuel oil from abroad has been cut off, fuel has become a problem. The government is trying to find a solution to the oil shortage. Oil production within France is very small. Although Banchelbrom has oil mines, its output is too small to be worth mentioning. The oil produced in the Hérault province in the south is also very small and does not help. In this situation, the authorities have to use local coal and wood as fuel. The production of local coal in western France is very abundant. The authorities have opened several factories specifically for refining local coal. In addition, charcoal-making equipment has been installed in the forests of the southwest. There are 50 new factories in the country for manufacturing this fuel, and it is expected that its output can replace the fuel oil that used to come from the United States and Iraq.</p>
<p>Finnish Athletes' Voluntary Work</p>
<p>Finnish athletes responded to the government's call and helped with logging in the forests, working for 25,000,000 hours. They also helped neighbors work for 5,000,000 hours. The value of these hours reached 175,000,000 marks. And all the athletes are working voluntarily.</p>
<p>Manchukuo Electric Power Company Plans</p>
<p>The Manchukuo Electric Power Company plans to add high-voltage power lines and a large number of transformer stations along the way this year to connect all light and heavy industry centers with power plants in various places. This plan requires an estimated expenditure of 150,000,000 yen, which can be obtained from three sources, namely (1) borrowing 100,000,000 yen, (2) soliciting new shares of 40,000,000 yen, and (3) using the company's surplus reserve funds of 10,000,000 yen.</p>
<h3>Social Security of the Economic Circle: China Health Company and China Health Association</h3>
<p>The greatest resource in life is one's own health, and all economic development is based on health as the greatest driving force. The China Health Company, which was recently launched by leaders of the Maritime Economic Circle and other circles, has all the latest modern medical equipment and can be called the first of its kind in this city's health industry. The various health work it promotes, such as general health checkups for citizens and anti-tuberculosis X-ray examinations, are not only important work for the development of preventive medicine, but also important factors for strengthening the economic power of citizens. Since its opening last month, it has attracted widespread attention. In order to promote various inspection work, the company issues health certificates in accordance with the health systems of various countries, with the aim of uncovering diseases before they manifest and treating diseases in the early stages, thereby saving the social burden of medical expenses. The inspection fee is divided into two types, 100 yuan and 50 yuan per person, and preferential treatment is given to various industrial and commercial organizations, with a discount of 25 yuan per person. In addition, industrial and commercial leaders are currently organizing the China Health Association, and it is expected that the city's society will be able to increase in health in the future, which will definitely contribute to economic development. The company is located at No. 96 Jing'an Temple Road, Meiqi Building.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: A Humble Opinion on "Increasing Industrial Loans" By Wang Wei</h3>
<p>"Increasing industrial loans"—from a practical point of view, it means strengthening the connection between finance and industry, and it is an important step under the current economic policy; this step can be actively promoted. In terms of industry, it can improve productivity and develop production relations; in the financial industry itself, it can put business on the right track and stabilize finance; therefore, we must not regard "increasing industrial loans" as a simple technical issue, but should recognize its importance from its impact on the overall economic situation.</p>
<p>Based on the decisions of the relevant parties regarding the implementation of "increasing industrial loans" that have been published in the newspaper over the past month, we can summarize the main five points as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Absorb floating capital, increase deposit interest rates, and recover investments in non-productive areas.</p>
<p>2.  Investigate whether the funds loaned by banks and money shops are used for production or hoarding.</p>
<p>3.  Use movable and immovable property as collateral for loans and various commodities as mortgages, but with proof from the relevant industry association.</p>
<p>4.  Overdrafts and credit loans must have solvent guarantors who guarantee that they will be fully cleared before the end of the year, and interest rates will be calculated according to the market prices announced monthly.</p>
<p>5.  Promote acceptance bills to help industries and businesses facilitate funding.</p>
<p>These methods are obviously still principled, and many concrete steps need to be considered during implementation. At the same time, we should see clearly the reality that the financial industry and the organizations of various industries in Shanghai are not sound. That is to say, the connection between various associations and their members is very loose. Most of them only do some communication work. As for business supervision, research, investigation, and assistance, they have just been mentioned; therefore, when encountering this policy of "increasing industrial loans," it is to be expected that many difficulties will arise and be encountered in the process of implementation.</p>
<p>Here, I will briefly express some of my opinions within my limited knowledge for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>First of all, I feel that raising deposit interest rates, absorbing floating capital, and recovering investments in non-productive areas to increase loans to industry is a good method, but how can we truly channel funds into the industrial sector? This is not a simple question. Because even if the loan accounts of banks and money shops are replaced by factories instead of commercial firms, it cannot be said that the goal of "increasing industrial loans" has been achieved, because the ultimate goal of "increasing industrial loans" is to increase production; therefore, there are three issues to be noted: First, at present, many factories are unwilling and unable to carry out production due to sluggish sales and huge manufacturing costs. They rely entirely on the buying and selling of raw materials and product inventory to maintain survival; for such factories, regardless of the degree of accumulation of their assets, in principle, they cannot obtain loans unless they start production. Second, even for factories that are currently engaged in production, loans must be determined according to their needs. I remember that in 1940, when foreign exchange was fluctuating violently, many factories borrowed money from banks, purchased huge quantities of raw materials, and put them in warehouses. They used the warehouse warrants to make mortgages to the bank and then purchased the second batch of raw materials to make mortgages again... This situation cannot be said to be completely absent now; therefore, when making loans—especially mortgage loans—it is necessary to strictly investigate whether it is needed for a certain period of production. Third, as I mentioned in my article "The Production Problem of Small Factories," the lending policy of banks and money shops is mostly "providing to those who lack and rejecting those who seek," so will some small factories that are actually engaged in production but are short of funds still be excluded?</p>
<p>In order to overcome these three possible problems, we must start from management. The Banking Association and the various industry associations should have a horizontal connection, plan the loan work according to the production situation of each industry, and discuss and study the problems that arise in both aspects during the implementation process; and each association should add a specialized department to strictly supervise and review the loan targets and production status; there is no doubt that without a sound management mechanism, the effectiveness of "increasing industrial loans" cannot be brought into play, and the role of "increasing production" cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the interest rate issue, from the perspective of banks and money shops, interest is a kind of income, which is a gross profit; from the perspective of factories, it is an expense, which is a production cost; the current interest rate is 30 yuan, which is one and a half times higher than the 12 yuan in January of last year, which is of course caused by the instability of currency and the turbulence of prices, and cannot be the responsibility of banks and money shops; my opinion is that under the situation that the currency is relatively stable and floating capital is heading towards the right track (deposits in various banks increased to 130 million yuan last month),</p>
<h3>Long-Term Research by Pharmaceutical Experts: Able to Produce Vitamin C Independently</h3>
<p>The discovery of vitamins is a major advancement in the history of modern medicine, greatly benefiting human health. Scientific and medical circles in various countries have attached great importance to it and have conducted extensive research. To date, more than twenty types have been discovered, forming a veritable specialized field of study. In recent years, many pharmaceutical factories have been established in our country, but those engaged in fundamental research work are still rare, mainly due to the backwardness of our country's science, inadequate equipment, and lack of talent. Recently, the research institute of one pharmaceutical factory, due to the cut-off of sources of foreign chemicals and pharmaceutical raw materials, has begun to conduct independent research, which is an excellent phenomenon.</p>
<p>**Successful Research After Two Years**</p>
<p>A Shanghai news agency reporter recently learned that the research institutes of some pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai have been working hard on research recently, and one of them has already achieved success. In the recent research work of Chinese scientists, the research of Dr. Sa Bentie and Master Shi Jiazhong on the production of vitamin C is worthy of attention. It is said that the two gentlemen were engaged in the research and analysis of vitamin C before the outbreak of the Pacific War, hoping to produce it independently. After six months of effort, they did not succeed. After the outbreak of the war, the two gentlemen continued their efforts due to the cut-off of raw material sources for vitamin C. With the help of various assistants, they proceeded separately. After twenty-two months of research, they finally discovered two bacteria that cause chemical changes in vitamin C, and Chinese people successfully produced vitamin C independently.</p>
<p>**Satisfactory Inspection and Start of Production**</p>
<p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an indispensable element for the human body. Common fruits such as oranges and lemons contain natural vitamin C, but it is not sufficient for therapeutic use. Artificially produced vitamin C was discovered by Swiss scientists ten years ago. The vitamin C used by various pharmaceutical factories in our country has always been purchased directly from foreign countries as raw materials. Now that Chinese scientists Dr. Sa Bentie and Master Shi Jiazhong have successfully researched it, the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory has conducted chemical, biological, and clinical tests, all of which have been deemed satisfactory. It is now being produced in large quantities, which is truly a glorious page in the history of our country's science.</p>
<h3>Oil and Felt Industry Association Holds Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Oil and Felt Industry Association of this city was established at the end of last month, and Zhang Furen was elected as the chairman, and Cheng Wenji was the secretary of the association.

<h3>Cartoon Association Hosts Reception for All Sectors Yesterday, Reporting on the Progress of the Exhibition</h3>
<p>The China Cartoon Association of this city, in order to instill war participation awareness, held a cartoon exhibition to support the participation in the Greater East Asia Construction on the 9th of last month at the Daxin Painting Hall, which closed on the 15th. Because the association received a lot of support from all sectors during the exhibition, it specially held a tea party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 6th) on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to thank all relevant parties and report on the progress of the cartoon exhibition. More than 30 people attended, including Lieutenant Yamaguchi of the Allied Army Information Department, Red Star Trustee, Captain Nagashima of the Navy Department, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Li Guohua (Zhang Dai), representative of the Anti-British and American Association, and Yuan Ludeng, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department. First, Chairman Cheng Zhiliang reported on the significance of the reception and thanked all parties for their assistance to the association. Subsequently, Honorary Chairman Xu Tieshan and Captain Nagashima delivered speeches successively, encouraging the association's work. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Notice: Cracking Down on Bad Habits of Citizens</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that residents within the boundary have not been able to implement common sense of hygiene, not only dump garbage in corners of walls and roadsides, but also spit at will on busy roads, which not only damages the city's appearance and exposes unsanitary bad habits, but also easily spreads prevalent rashes such as pulmonary tuberculosis, colds, and leprosy, which greatly affects public health. In order to protect the public health of the people, it has decided to crack down on the above-mentioned bad habits. Therefore, it issued a notice to remind residents throughout the city to pay attention, and ordered all police stations under its jurisdiction to severely punish residents who commit the above-mentioned acts in order to improve the city's appearance and protect public health.</p>

<h3>The Vocational Problems of Young People</h3>
<p>— Ye Minhe</p>
<p>All ambitious young people are determined not to rely on the wealth of their families to lead a boring life, but would rather endure all kinds of difficulties and setbacks, struggling in society for their own future. However, the leaders of society are indifferent to the future and development of young people. A middle school graduate is often given an apprentice job like a beast of burden. An ordinary store, when it needs personnel, immediately asks for a high school degree. No matter what agency or store, as long as it wants to recruit one or two people in the newspaper, thousands of young people immediately apply, competing like squeezing oil, rice, and sugar, vying for this position that they know has very little hope. Even college students are willing to condescend to apply.</p>
<p>Especially in today's society, whether it is a factory or a company, employing people only considers relationships, not ability. Job security is even less to speak of. The treatment is harsh, and the income is often not enough for one's own use, let alone supporting a family. The length of working hours, eleven hours, makes it unnecessary to think about the issue of young people's learning and self-study. Outside of working hours, they must also bear responsibility tirelessly. Occasionally, a small mistake will ruin all previous efforts and lead to immediate elimination, with no room for forgiveness.</p>
<p>It is really as difficult as ascending to the sky for a young person to leave school or a store and seek an opportunity to enter the commercial field. Those without commercial experience are not hired, and those with experience are asked for a certificate. If you have one, there will be unexpected problems to embarrass you, asking why you left your previous place of service. When you describe your past history, they immediately hold the prejudice that young people who have served elsewhere are unreliable. I ask, where are there so many young people who have not entered society and are rich in commercial experience waiting? How can you not chill the hearts of vocational youth and young people who have not left school? The concept of "graduation is unemployment" can be said to have originated from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to ask the leaders of society to abandon their prejudices and discuss and solve all events with lower-level personnel in a practical manner, so as to make the relationship between superiors and subordinates harmonious, eliminate all feelings of estrangement, cultivate young people more, and assume true leadership responsibility, then young people will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!</p>
