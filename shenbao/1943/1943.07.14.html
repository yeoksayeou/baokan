<p>社評</p>
<h3>庫爾斯克·西西里·南太平洋</h3>
<p>暴風雨前的靜寂終於結束了，一九四三年的夏季攻勢巳經開始了，不出我們以往的推測，歐洲的戰爭，還首先是在德蘇戰塲上爆發的。七月五日，以庫爾斯克戰塲爲中心，展開了運用大兵團的會戰，雖然這次戰爭，德方說是由蘇聯發動的，蘇聯則宣傳是由德方發動的，然而誰先發動，與戰爭的前途無關，就目前國際情况說，則德國確是會有主動的優勢，並且已經在若干地點，突破了敵方的戰錢，奪佔若干要據點，這是蘇聯方面也已加以承認的了；戰爭的趨勢，現在方在激烈進行中，我們尙未能依據零散的戰　，作正確的推論，觀於將近半年之久的雙方準備，以及雙方之作戰行動與官方戰報之愼重態度，可以想見，今年的戰爭，在任何一方，都將是最艱苦也最不易在短期內獲得勝利的戰爭，它們勢將經過最悠長的苦戰。在德國方面，根據一九四一·一九四二兩年夏季攻勢的經騐，當然不會以佔地之廣作爲戰爭的勝利，而置其作戰重心於對紅軍戰鬥力之殲滅性的打擊，同時更盡力以政治之戰輔翼軍事之戰，以求爭取決定性的戰果。常然，在蘇聯方面，仍在企圖拖延戰爭至冬季來臨，因此，目前或許仍在力避大兵團的　戰，可是，這一種戰略，軸心國當然早已瞭然，觀乎這次庫爾斯克前綫作戰中，德方兵力即達去年攻佔史太林格勒同樣龐大程度，以脅逼蘇聯紅軍之集中，而加以殲滅性打擊，則紅軍上述企圖是否能實現，還是一大　問。</p>
<p>德蘇戰塲上的苦戰展開以後不久，蘇聯方而輿論對於英美遲不開闢第二戰綫一事，發表最後也最露骨的抗議，同時，蘇聯駐英大使邁世基匆匆返國，美方輿論紛起反對羅斯福及邱吉爾，罷工運動再度嚴重化，在這種四面楚歌聲中，反軸心軍事當局乃倉猝發動了西西里島登陸作戰。激烈的戰事，正在西西里島東南一隅進行，軸心軍利用空中的優勢，正給英·美·加拿大各登陸軍隊的後援部隊及運輸艦以打擊。如果反軸心軍不能維持其接濟綫，則登陸各部隊之就殲，自然只是時間問題。現在，世界的目光，也許除了西西里之外，還會注視到地中海北岸的其他部分，或者，也有人憂慮到大西洋和波羅的海方面會不會發生任何意外，但是，如果對於反軸心軍的實力——特別是人力及其後援力量，則可以說，這種憂慮，是毫無根據的。何况，問題的另一面，還要看到軸心國方面的防衛力量，英美是否那麼傻，不惜以國運作孤注之一擲，而認眞在西歐開闢「第二戰綫，不但依然可疑，因爲攻堅拔銳，這在英美的戰史上是有着力求避免之成例的。</p>
<p>戰爭之決定力量，主要的要看軸心國的後方，人力物力總動員之現狀，及其今後的發展，是否能够適應今後戰局發展的新需要，其最基本的要素是軍需工業生產力之情形，是否能够佔有優勢，這一方面，從目前現况說，軸心國是佔有極大優越地位的，如果未來的戰爭在歐洲，無論爲西北，西部或東南發展，從地理的見地，也可以斷言，今後形勢會對軸心國有利，因爲，英美加的軍隊，一旦在歐洲的任何方面登陸之後，他們人員與軍火的消耗量，就一般戰爭經騐言，是要倍於防禦方面的，其需要補充之迫急，自不待言；假定英·美·加及北非方面具有相當的補充實力（似乎在最近半年來，英美分經努力於此），但最嚴重的問題還是發生在海洋運輸方面，不久以前，即在六月間，邱吉爾自美返英的第一次報吿中，已曾承認今後作戰之主要內容仍是反潛艇戰，可見其對於一旦登陸歐洲以後接濟問題之焦慮，而在軸心國方面，完全相反，他們可以大胆地開放捕鼠之袋，未恐其不深入！因爲戰爭在歐洲進行，還怕歐洲的人力物力不爲保衛歐洲而用？</p>
<p>最不能忽視的是太平洋上的戰事，在德蘇戰綫及西西里登陸戰爭前後，澳洲及其附近的美軍，發動了對新幾內亞和附近一帶島嶼的「反攻」，這種蠢動，在某種限度內，會被誇言爲太平洋大反攻的序幕，或者，實際上只是一種擾亂性的游擊戰，企圖以「攻勢」來阻撓日本可能乘歐局緊張而推展的新攻勢。觀於反軸心軍「反攻」目標之特別放在澳洲外圍綫內諸島嶼這一點，可以十分明顯地看出，上述第二種戰略估計之正確性。老實說，美國雖以其全國最大部分的軍力和幾乎全部的海軍力放在太平洋上，雖然在國際一切軍事的與外交的會談中，侈言太平洋總反攻的準備，但是，實際上自珍珠灣一役遭受嚴重的打擊以來，無論在那一方面，迄未恢復其反攻勝利的信心。所以最近他們在太平洋上的騷亂行動，無寗說是出於內心虛怯之一種行動，完全是被動性的消極性的。不過，是不是說東亞人在今日就無需提高對敵人的警惕性呢？那還是絕對需要的，始終站在主動的優越的地位，不失時機地給敵人以打擊，是保衛東亞的戰略中心，也是實現軸心世界戰略的基本要領。友邦東條首相之於萬政綜綰之際，親赴南洋馬來泰緬菲島各地，二次進行協助緬菲獨立事業，以及以江特拉鮑斯爲中心的印度獨立運動，建立起西亞反英第二戰綫，此種新事態，可以說明在歐洲的暴風雨開始震動人心之時，東方各民族解放的運動將要踏上更新的階段，而逼使英美帝國主義勢力之總崩潰，當爲其中心的內容。</p>

<p>東京十三日中央社電　西南太平洋方面之航空戰况日益熾烈，日海軍航空部隊七月九日白晝復以戰鬥機，轟炸機聯合大編隊，轟炸嚴加警戒之倫特巴港，與警戒於該港內外之敵戰鬥機展開壯烈空戰，結果擊落敵機五架，更投彈轟炸停泊港內之上陸軍用舟艇，炸沉其中六艘。十一日繼續以此種大編隊往襲新佐治亞島，猛炸在該島西北岸頓斯灣北洛哥方面上陸中之敵軍，此等敵軍於庫拉灣夜戰中，已蒙重大損害，經此次轟炸後損失允多，日機並與哨戰中之敵「P.38」渥特西科爾斯基型戰鬥機四十架交戰，擊落其二十四架，收獲偉大戰果，是後日機三架尙未歸還。</p>

<p>德軍在東綫作戰　獲戰略成功　蘇軍側翼攻擊停止</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍司令部今日公報稱：德軍在空軍掩護之下，在貝爾格勒之北，擊敗蘇軍坦克車集團二大隊之後，已獲得更多之進展，蘇軍步兵與坦克車隊之反攻以及在奥萊爾東區與北區之猛烈攻擊，均告崩潰，損失極重。昨日德軍又擊毀蘇方坦克車四百輛。同時敵機一百零三架爲德空軍高射砲隊所擊落，</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員宣稱：上週未貝爾格勒與奥萊爾區戰事激烈程度，有增無减，惟迄今尙未達到頂點，蘇軍進攻力已弱，但其抵抗力仍頗頑强，德軍尙未能即日獲得決定性之勝利，然德軍進攻乃以戰略爲重，並不急求速進。目前最大之目標乃在消除庫斯克方面之蘇軍突出地帶。按蘇軍之在該區者，曾擬就攻勢計畫，故集中之軍隊與軍需甚爲雄厚，蘇方本擬在英·美進攻西西里時，同時發動攻勢，俾予軸心國以重大打擊，今則此計劃已被德軍之進攻所破壞。德軍指揮部知其用意。遂作牽制敵軍之謀，使其本欲用於進攻之軍隊。不得不改取守勢，故德軍在庫斯克之作戰，今己完成最大任務，世人不察，或將以爲庫斯克之戰事僅具次要意義。但以戰略而論，德軍指揮部對當前之戰果，已能引爲滿意。敵方雖稱吾人損失重大，不知其損失實更茶於吾人，在戰事最初五日中，蘇軍維柯索夫斯基將軍，曾竭其能力派遣坦克車隊由東西兩而包抄德軍鐵甲車先鋒隊，企圖切　其後路，但德指揮早已預料及此，乃採用全新之防禦戰略，應用抵制坦克車之新武器，予進攻之蘇坦克軍隊以重創，應德方昨日宣布：擊毀之蘇坦克車已有一千六百四十輛之多，上週末蘇軍復以其殘餘坦克車隊展開陣地戰，阻遏德軍先鋒隊之銳勢，致德軍自貝爾格勒之進展爲之稍行展緩，但並未陷於停頓。德軍之一消耗略」可謂已告成功，蘇軍之側翼攻擊，祇得停止，據德方十二日之公報宣稱：蘇軍共損失大砲一千四百尊，止作戰行動上自己受到影響，惟蘇軍在奥萊爾迤南之兵力仍極堅　。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日發表：德軍於奥萊爾地區自五日後所獲之戰果如次：俘敵二萬四千人，鹵獲及擊毀敵戰車一千五百四十輛，槍砲等達一萬四千挺。</p>

<p>（問）　廢治外法權以後，我國司法制度將有革新吾？（答）司法制度之革新，爲政府一貫之方策，本部羅部長蒞任以來，更　努力推進之中，並不因撤廢治外法權，方始有革新之計劃，而今後關於司法制度之改進，當因收囘租界及撒廢治外法權而當更加奮勉，務期現行制度益臻完備。（問）我國最近關於法院之設施狀况如何？（答）縣長兼理司法制度，本爲畸形制產，本部對於撒　縣司法處及縣長兼理司法，遍設地方法院及分院分庭早具決心。正在積極推廣實施中，計第一期已吿改組成立者，有上海地方法院嘉定分院，上海地方檢察署嘉定分署，崑山地方法院太倉分院，崑山地方檢察署太倉分署，杭縣地方法院紹興分院，杭縣地方檢察署紹興分署，杭縣地方法院海寗分庭，蕪湖地方法院當塗分庭等等，其餘朱設地方法。或分　分庭之縣份，常於最近期內，分期推進成立，以應付撒廢治外法權之環境。（問）治外法權澈廢後，將來關於涉外訴訟案件，是否概由我國法　受理？（答）當然由吾國法院受理，營轄外國人訴訟暫行條例已起草完竣，在審查中。（間）上海租界收囘後，法院如何調整　（答）租界收囘後，嗣後關於上海司法事件，自應依一元化之體制下，歸　當地法院　理，而歷年來受協定拘　，以致未能允份行使職　之檢察官，在此交還租界及擴大檢察制度之兩種關係下，更必强化而活躍，（問）我團法制是否已達完善地步最近擬草訂之新法制有幾種？（答）我國法制，近已大致完備，惟具中有應加增修者，如非訟事件程序　之起草，法律適用條例之修訂，及外國法之迻　等，刻正由本部另設一法規編修委員會聘請專門委員從事負實審訂。（間）關於外國人監獄之計劃如何？（答）本部刑務署　署民上月視察各地監獄囘部。即已擬有詳細計劃，並已令上海漢口兩地先行籌殷收容外國人之監所，至關於改善監所，策劃囚犯生活之改良，內部設備之改進，以及督導囚犯外役作業等項，迭經本部嚴切改進，已著相當成效。（問）關於司法警察有改進之計劃否？（答）自檢察改制後，編練法警實爲基本整頓司法之重點，必加嚴密組織，務使調度敏活，尤以上海租界收同以後，當能有健全之法警，與行政方面，通力合作，成爲維持社會秩序之重要機構。</p>
<h3>冀中冀南　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>石門十三日中央社電　日軍在冀中　南之　淸戰，現正繼續進行，總計六月份中，共與渝其軍交戰一八六次，渝共軍交戰兵力，累計二一八二四人，被俘七四四人，遺屍一六一九人，日軍截獲迫擊砲四門，重機槍一挺，輕機槍七八八挺，步槍一六八八一支，及其他自動步槍手槍手溜彈士砲等甚多。</p>
<h3>美國種族問題的解剖</h3>
<p>不久前，美國最大的軍需工業都市第德羅發生的壓迫黑人事件，果然集中了全世界的視聽，這決不僅是偶然事件，所謂美國之癌的人種問題的不一致性，一涉及決戰途上美國國內糾紛的磨擦點，必然爆發此種事件，同時，並充分暴露了沒有自由，沒有平等，沒有正義的民主主義之根本的缺陷及矛盾，以及盎格魯撒克遜帝國主義之貪得無饜的野心之一端和美國人的獸性野蠻性，誠爲値得注目的事件。</p>
<p>壓迫黑人的歷史　羅斯福總統自此次大戰以來，曾苦思焦慮，以覓得適當之戰爭目標。或稱此次大戰乃是爲民治主義而戰爭，爲生存而戰爭，並又揭起了爲四種自由而戰的標語——即宗敎自由，言論自由，從恐怖中求自由，並從缺乏中求自由。但那不過是表面的好聽名詞，其實乃是爲了滿足盎格魯撒克遜人本身慾望的手段。他們的所謂自由，平等，正義者，對於一切別的國家，凡是違反異秤異族及本國的利害者，均加以否定，厭迫黑人事件，即是美國的這種掩耳盜鈴的把戲。</p>
<p>此次的暴動事件發生於第德羅海岸附近，發端於某年輕黑人女子爲白人所殺害，卒致擴大爲人種戰。據報羅斯福出動了全副武裝的軍隊，始漸被鎭壓下去。但這問題的根源，可遠溯至美國的建國以前以迄今日一貫於美國歷史中的排他的本能性。</p>
<p>美國的黑人今日有一千三百萬人，在美國的總人口一億三千二百萬人中，約占十分之一。這些黑人乃係自十七世紀初以來，被英美人把居住於非洲的和平而醇樸的士著用狩獵野獸的同樣手段驅集攏來，當作奴隸而輸入美洲的黑人的子孫。這些土人足上鎖了枷，二人一組用鐵鎖擊起來，用奴隸船運到美洲。幾個月的航海時間中，被押閉於甲板的木籠中及艙內，不得動彈，大小便均就地而行，故病死者，發狂者甚多。每年總有數萬人這樣被運至美洲，直至二百五十年後，即一八八四年宣言解放奴隸時止，在美的黑人奴隸總數共　四百五十萬人。</p>
<p>奴隸均在紐約港方面起卸，以每人數十美元至一千美元的代價脫售，依然繫以鐵鎖，加以鞭撻，驅使在從事棉田或其他激烈勞働，所有主把他們視同牛馬，爲防止其逃亡起見，常用鐵烙在黑人背上刻印自己的記號。即此事實，即足以否定美國人的人性。他們對以後移居於美國的日本人，中國人，愛爾蘭人，德國人。義大利人，斯堪的那維亞人，斯拉夫人，希臘人，墨西哥人等，加以一切拷打，虐殺，暴行，迫放等壓迫，歷史可資證明。</p>
<p>驅使於軍隊工廠　黑人在一八八六年的林肯大總統時代，雖在法律上已從奴隸的地位解放，但那祗是官樣文章，僅免除了足枷，此外依然受與奴隸同樣的虐待與壓迫。</p>
<p>茲舉二，三個具體的例來看：第一，被白人的暴徒干犯法律所行的私刑所虐殺的黑人數實達三千四百餘名之多。此次大戰勃發後，羅斯福政府爲謀緩和人的資源之困難及强化國內統制計，採取各種和善的政策，以促進編成黑人軍，或大量動員黑人勞働者向軍需生產方面工作。例如美國海軍最近發表把在瓜島戰死的黑人兵路易哈門的名字用以命名新近就役的驅逐艦。但這不過是空名，無論在軍隊內，在軍需工廠內，在一般的國民生活上，黑人受絕對的差別待遇。陸軍部長史汀生曾豪語編制黑人部隊九十萬人，迫這些黑人所受的訓練和白人的軍隊不同，膳食及其他待遇亦極惡劣，而且常被白人部隊蔑視，排斥，時常發生衝突而致流血的慘事。在戰塲上，也驅使衝當最危險的戰事和地域。結果，在民治主義的空名下，成爲白人的犧牲。</p>
<p>依然視同奴隸</p>
<p>美國海軍從來未曾採用黑人，此次戰爭勃發後，爲彌補兵員的不足，採用若干黑人，但僅配置於海軍基地的下級任務，不許和白人一同在艦上服務。軍需工廠方面，黑人雖爲　有力的人的資源力，但白人勞働者不屑與黑人並肩勞働各地人種糾紛，時有所聞。去年三月，第德羅市發生壓迫黑人暴動事件，出動數千警官鎭壓，但白人對就勞於軍需工廠的黑人勞働者及其家族的移居，想用暴力加以壓迫，因而許多勞働組織不充黑人爲會員，美國最大的勞働組織A.F.L（美國勞働總同盟）公然加以排斥。一般國民對黑人的差別待遇最甚者。即對從事低劣的體力勞働的黑人用低工資大加利用，在日常社會生活上，無論在任何塲合。一槪不許黑人同席。黑人衆多的南部諸州，在汽車，電車，公共汽車，旅館醫院，劇塲，電影院，酒吧間，厠所，學校。圖書館等一切塲所，均與白人隔離或禁止出入。在華盛頓以至紐約各大都市，白人進出的劇塲，電影院，醫院，旅館，酒吧間，舞塲，電梯等塲所，不許黑人進出，甚至於全美大多數的基督敎堂亦不許黑人入內。把正義，自由，平等掛在嘴上的美國人，即在神前亦竟有這種虛僞的行爲，最近美國的紅十字會拒絕黑人誠心誠意送至陸軍傷兵病院的慰問文。倫敦的「新政治家及民族』（CnewStatesmcuandNation）雜誌著文論評數日前的美國黑人問　，說美國所加於黑人的屈辱，在黑人間所引起的反感日趨增大。美國在自行招致的戰爭漩渦中甚感煩惱苦悶趁此千載一時的良機，全美千三百萬黑人，覺醒了自己的民族意識，毅然揭起解放的旗幟。（翔：譯自六月二十七日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>德機襲英</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據倫敦電　德空軍十二日夜轟炸英東部。</p>
<h3>中共最高幹部　召開緊急會議　商應付渝方要求</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　據確息：中共中央執行委員會自接獲渝（國防最高委員會）要求將陝甘寗邊區一帶之中共政權交還渝方，與調第十八集團軍移駐他方之條文後，即由毛澤東林祖涵張聞天千稼穡等中共最高首腦，舉行協議，結果決定召開黨政軍首腦部之臨時緊急會議，傳朱德林彪賀龍等前綫中共軍各將領，已均應召相繼赴延安，中共最高幹部鑒及此項事態之嚴重，故極愼重從事，最後方策，由全體黨員票決，故此舉將決定中共將來之運命。又延安方面對於周恩來郭沫若等中共駐渝代表，似尙無任何具體之表示，此外中共中堅及中共軍斡部如朱德賀龍林彪彭德懷劉伯承等中共軍幹部，成認渝方之要求，非僅欲即時消滅陝甘寗邊區中共之勢力，並顯有壓迫中共中央及第十八集團軍之意　，故中共中堅方倡　絕渝方之要求，並主張向渝（最高國防委員會）提出反對條件。又中共軍幹部態度更爲强硬，謂渝方如施以軍事之高壓手段時，則不惜犧牲民族統一戰綫，與之訴諸武力，觀此情形，毋待中共臨時緊急會議議決，即可推知中共定將拒絕渝方之要求。</p>
<p>北京十三日中央社電　國際共產黨斛散後渝方即飛機對中共加重迫，據最近當地所得消息，渝方對中共中樞地區陝甘寗邊區之軍事壓力激增、故中共頓感狼狽，乃以陝甘密邊區共軍，對渝軍取對抗之勢，第十八集團軍後方留守處主任兼陝甘寗邊區軍司令蕭勁光，並對堅持包圍態勢之渝軍第八戰區將領發出通電如左：「傳聞渝欲大舉進攻陝甘密邊區，惟當此民族存亡之秋，又將展開內戰。實所痛心，六年來第十八集團軍毫無補給陝甘寗邊區乃我唯一之後方基地少數留守部隊担任防備工作，從事生產敎育。此乃衆所週知者、今當此國內發生內戰此對國家民族之前途，實不堪設想，蓋國內問題，宜以政治方法解決，故希以各將領以和平方法，謀求解決」等語云，以求緩和渝方對中共之壓迫。但其另一方面，則依然嗾使廿肅及伊克昭盟展開反攻運動，擾亂後方秩序，觀此，今後渝共於西北邊疆之全面鬥爭，或將煎趨激烈。</p>
<h3>陳中季犒賞　集訓營學員</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　新國民巡動會公務人員及靑少年團兩集訓營學員，自本月一日入營以來，即本刻苦耐勞，勇猛精進之訓，努力學習，前任主席曾從營訓話，對於學員之精神，甚爲滿意，茲悉　中委璧君，前曾至營視察，對學員於此炎暑受訓，甚爲嘉勉，昨十三日下午特贈兩營學員鹹肉六百五十斤，以佐晚餐，兩營學員，甚爲感激。</p>
<h3>西西里岛激战　繼續進行中　軕心軍克復一機場</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍司令部今日公報稱：西西里島上激戰仍在繼續進行中，軸心空軍不斷參加地上之戰鬥，並襲擊該島沿海岸外之敵軍登陸艦隊，予敵以重大之損失。西西里島與撒丁島上空，敵機被擊落二十五架。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日宣稱：西西里島之德·義防禦軍，十一日下午猛擊自該島束南海岸登陸之英·美軍，予以重創，義軍並將於南岸登陸後向西方進攻之美軍擊退至海岸綫一帶。其他地點及反軸心軍只保持其原陣地，敵爲繼續從事登陸作戰，必仍派遣大量援軍，但因敵於初期作戰階段並未得利，故今後即增援兵力進攻，徒供犧牲而已。又德軍當局於十二日夜重述西西里島戰况稱：反軸心軍於西西里島佔領之海岸地帶，因被軸心軍之猛攻，範圍已愈趨縮小，就戰局之全體而觀，經此三日之激戰，反軸心軍所佔領地區，已僅餘西西里島東南部狹窄之海岸地帶，共降落傘部隊亦完全不支放棄陣地。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍當局十二日宣稱：西西里島軸心軍，自十一日出動優勢部隊殲滅反軸心軍之降落傘部隊，至十二日並佔領西西里島南岸要銜機爾眞提灣，克復反軸心軍傘兵所佔領之機塲，並擊滅反軸心軍兩隊。</p>
<p>兩日間戰况</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社軍事訪自塞托柯斯上尉宣稱：截至星期一午後爲止，此間所獲西西里島上局勢之消息，知該處戰事祗限於東南一隅　另悉，　軸心軍之進攻西西里東南海岸時，共計兩軍，一　英軍，擔任攻取，克洛斯角　巴西洛　之一　　　　美　、並由加拿大部隊協助擔任進攻由里加太至斯加拉米亞角中間之海岸，英，美此項行動之策略，顯欲以集中前進之方式，包圍駐守西西里東南山岳區　之德·義軍隊·或迫使彼等阿巴爾瑪加太尼亞一綫迅速退卻，俾該島之東南　份不由有德。義軍之踪跡　據星期　下午听獲該島局勢之消息、可見反軸心軍距此目標尙甚遙遠，英軍至今祇能佔領由叙拉古斯至巴西洛角之一狹條海岸地帶，深度約爲五至十公里，而美軍方面迄今祇能獲得少數橋頭堡爲據點，週末時此兩路反軸心軍隊均企圖以已登陸之軍隊迅速向內地推進，以期與傘兵相會合，但結果祗有少數地方傘兵降落於海岸附近者獲得成功。而降落於內地者，則大半皆爲義軍所殲滅。</p>
<p>奪吉拉港會有激戰　星期日德義兩軍後備隊之抵禦行動殊堪注意，彼等在距離岸五至十公里之處遭遇英軍之前進，而美軍前進亦受重創，被迫退至其在里加太至吉拉間之橋頭堡，星期一晨　方因爭奪吉拉港曾發生激戰，據星期一午刻之情形而觀，在克斯角與巴西洛角間作戰英軍之總指揮：似擬在繼續推進之前維持其所佔領之區域，並以登陸軍隊爲掩護，使坦克車重砲及生力軍隊陸續運抵岸上。此間佔計現在已登陸之英軍約達四個師團之衆，美軍已在南海岸登陸之數量。亦達二個師團。內包括加拿大軍隊一師團，因在吉拉方面曾遭慘敗，故　於增援，反軸心軍境仍擁有大批後備隊，且至今並未儘量使用，其所能調用之船舶，自無可疑，是　艾森　華將軍欲將其登陸之軍隊增加一倍，亦正非難事也目前西西里戰事，仍在開始階段中，軸心國人士皆信不日將有極激烈之戰鬥。</p>
<p>艾森霍華一度登陸　百倫十三日中央社電　德國新聞社消息：反軸心方而傳軸心軍司令部正將大最軍隊調向南面、據現已探悉之軸心部隊，爲立伏爾　　四師團，在蓋拉北之與美軍對壘。及那波里第五十四師團，在叙拉古附近與英軍相持，據云此兩部隊皆有德軍協助作戰，主持反軸心軍在西西里作戰之艾森霍華將軍，已於昨晨疾驅逐艦至西西里島之東南部登陸。據路透社稱：艾森霍華與美軍新第七軍之司令巴東將軍會商後，即離該島。反軸心方面關於西西里島局勢之消息，大體頗爲審愼，並警吿謂，軸心軍指揮部必將增加其對抗之力量，故英·美軍最困難之任務尙在將來。</p>
<p>美英兩軍參戰部隊　德國新聞社稱：在西西里作戰之美軍，計有步兵第一·第三·第四十五及坦克車第二師之一部，空中運送兵第八十二師之一部，此項部隊即　成美軍新第七軍，由巴東中將統率，巴東在北非戰伇中爲美第五軍司令。英軍在西西里島作戰者爲英步兵第五師。第五十一師。加拿大步兵第一師。坦克車第二十二旅及坦克車第六師之一部。加拿大軍第一師係由英國調至西西里，專供此次作戰者，此外，尙有英傘乓數營參加作戰，此項部隊係由前在里比亞及突尼西亞統率英第八軍之蒙特戈姆萊將軍指揮。反軸心之空軍，係由英空軍總元帥鐵達爾爵士指揮，助之者有英空軍元帥克銀漢爵士，英空軍副元帥勞特爵士，美軍之斯巴茲中將及杜立特爾少將。反軸心海軍則由海軍上將克寗漢爵士指揮，美艦隊司令爲希威特中將。</p>
<h3>義全民一致　决保衛國土　美承認進攻西西里困難　土耳其政界抱靜觀態度</h3>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　通社訊：羅馬有咨格人士評論西西里之戰役，鄭重聲稱：義大利全國人民鎭靜對付久在意料中之攻擊，並以不可動搖之決心盡力保衛祖國土地。抵抗敵人義大利人今日祗有一個口號，即「義大利全國上下一致，在首相領導之下，決心保衛祖國神聖之土地』。</p>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　蓋達昨在義大利日報宣布，反軸心軍在西西里登陸之處，係荒僻之海岸地區，該處之軸心軍因避免反軸心軍艦之砲轟，已於事前撤退，軸心之戰略爲引進攻敵軍入內地，然後與之作戰，首先登陸之反軸心部隊，在軸心軍尙未大部加入作戰時，已遭遇猛烈之戰鬥。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　通社訊：柏林及羅馬方面，對於西西里事態之信心逐漸增加，而英方對於登陸之消息已較爲愼重。柏林方面相信，反軸心大概係因蘇極曾以最後通牒要求反軸心立刻行動，故不計及軍事上之利害，而遽於此時攻擊，猶憶邱吉爾首相曾屢言，軍事上攻擊義大利，對於政治方面有極大電要性，而艾森霍華亦輕視義軍之實力，此項錯誤之觀念，即爲此次尙未準備完畢，遽行攻擊西四里之原因。</p>
<p>里期本十三日中央社電　美陸軍部發言人昨日在華盛頓宜布：「吾人須準備在西西里之戰鬥中受嚴軍之損失，蓋該處之戰鬥將甚困難。」發言人又稱：訓練優良而有紀律之軸心軍，必將奮勇抗戰並猛烈反攻，欲將西西里島完全佔領，殊非易事。</p>
<p>斯丹埠十三日中央社電　土耳其政界方面表示懷疑英·美之在西西里登陸是否能使蘇聯滿意，蓋東面蘇聯戰綫戰鬥極烈，故此間相信蘇聯將要求較之現時進攻西西里更爲重要之行動。土耳其方面對於西西里之奮力抗戰，有深邃之印象，並對於未來數日間之事態抱靜觀態度。</p>
<h3>反軸心戰艦　一艘中彈</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊，據德空軍人員報告稱：進攻西西里之反軸心戰鬥艦一艘，曾在該島海岸附近被擊中，該艦曾起濃烟。又據其他消息稱：所傳曾被擊傷之運輸艦中，有多艘已可認爲業已沉沒。</p>
<h3>日紡積機移緬</h3>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　日本曾於本年四月決定大規模，對南方移駐紡績設備計劃要綱，近關係方面根據該要綱，已將一部日本紡績設備運抵此間，頃正着手裝備，預定最近開業，所產棉將供給緬甸手工業使用。按日本紡機之移駐緬甸，此次尙屬初次，將來頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>義佛蘭西斯中將　在西西里島陣亡</h3>
<p>羅馬十三日中央社電　斯帶芬尼社訊，據官方昨日宣稱：第十三區黑衣團司令兼西西里駐軍之民軍聯絡官佛蘭四斯中將，已於七月十一日陣亡，氏曾以志願軍之資格，參與西班牙內戰，此次戰爭中亦曾在蘇聯戰綫服役，自去年三月即駐西西里。</p>
<h3>推行南方軍玫　入第二階段　菲島建設工作積極進行</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十三日中央社電　日軍政監部爲確立南方各地之自給體制，推行軍政已進入第二階段，並爲期其早日完成目的，故正加强推進中，其中</p>
<p>菲島人民　因於本所內即將獨立，刻爲準備一切，對建設工作進行尤爲積極。菲島軍政當局過去鑒於菲島物資豐富，於共榮圈內所占地位極爲重要，故施政目標着重於重新整備經濟，決定繼續開採錳鉻等鑛。於農業部門中，按照計劃增產爲尼拉麻，椰子，乾煙葉，木材等，並將菲島一部分糖業轉移生產目標。同時爲期經濟建設順利進展及安定民生起見，決首先推行糖食增產運動，以謀確保現地糖食之自給自足，經軍政當局過去一年間之努力，一切俱已步入正軌，當局並認在此大東亞戰爭下之際，確立菲島自給體制，愈益重要。蓋菲島爲</p>
<p>適應獨立　情勢及對於南方前綫完成其所負兵站基地之任務起見，謀其早日達成確立自給體制，實爲必要，故於本年三月樹立糧食增產五年計劃，着重於增產主要糧食米及玉蜀黍，並謀增產甘薯，豆類等雜糧，且悉委諸菲島行政府負責推行。菲島行政亦認確立菲島糧食自給體制，實爲完成菲島經濟自立之基礎，而爲菲島實行獨立之必要條件，乃動員行政府所屬農業方面全體官員，分赴各地宣傳，行政府農商務部並增加野外指導員，利用各項宣傳品，促起農民注意，本年五月因雨期已近，乃於產米各州分別舉行</p>
<p>糧食增產　協議會，磋商選擇種子，改良技術，開墾荒地，獎勵施肥等各項問題，並與新菲島奉仕團協力，着手組織農民改善土地制度。關於日用品生產方面，亦恢復紡織，椰子油，肥皂，製紙，火柴等工廠，分別委託日國內企業家前往經營，並使以合辦方式參加其組織之工廠復工，力謀經營之合理化及改進生產技術，其製品則經生活必需物資配給組合後，向一般消費者實施配給制度。軍政監部並與菲島行政府協力樹立增强經工業計劃，最近復決定以日本國內之一部分工廠設備移往菲島，因此菲島紡織及製紙業之產額俱將激增三四倍之鉅。此外復着手</p>
<p>增設機械　器具工廠及全面恢復油漆麻袋水泥等工廠，當局並認爲期此項生產計劃獲得實效起見，則發　交通實爲必要，故關於陡運方面於本年三月前業將菲島原有鐵道悉數修復，並計劃增設新綫，關於海運方面則恢復島內主要航路，並利用菲島豐富木材，於現地積極建造木造船，當此菲島獨立期近之際，此項工作之進展亦益形迅速。</p>

<h3>外機百餘架　侵瑞士領空</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十三日中央社電　瑞士政府十三日發表公報謂：外國飛機百餘架，十二日夜半左右，又侵犯瑞士領空。衆認所謂外國飛機，顯係反軸心飛機，蓋是夜此項飛機以三千米之高度由法邊境侵入，飛過日內瓦方面，內有一架在布威萊墮落，並曾在利基斯堡等三處非法投下炸彈，致有民房十問被毀，另一問中　起火。</p>

<p>（二）地點　四川路一三三號廣播大　收買所（電話一一六二二），</p>
<p>（三）携帶物件：甲·前無綫電收音機登記證（即巡捕房或警察局之登記證）。乙·「甲」號禁制收音機登記證如尙未登記或遺失者應即重新登記，務須携帶圖章爲要）丙·收音機·</p>

<p>（四）凡違反上開各項者，依照軍法嚴　不貸，</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>經濟病態</h3>
<p>中國經濟上之病態，就記者所知，的有下列數點：</p>
<p>第一，缺乏調查統計。即以各地物品供求情形而言，究竟產量若干，銷量若干。某地盈餘着千，某地虧耗若干，均乏確實之調査，與精密之統計，僅憑口說，於是謠言隨之，致物價之　漲，漫無止境，市面所受影響實大，此其一。</p>
<p>第二無平準之辦法。物價貴乎安定，推　至於股票債券，何一不　安定，安定之先決問　，在有平準之辦法，如某地物價過高，即當運入相當數量，予以調劑，如某地物價過低，即由公家酌量收買，以免外來物資，裏足不前，此其二。</p>
<p>第三，物資交流之夢。物資交流，騰爲口說久矣。顧甲地與乙地，乙地與丙地之物資，阻滯不動，價格懸殊。一方苦物資之無出路，一方苦供給之無門，此中癥結，究竟安在？有何方法，足以打破此種僵局？此其三。</p>
<p>以上三點。希望政府當局與經濟界賢哲予以注意，以求中國經濟界之出死求生，此則爲吾人所一致禱求者。</p>
<h3>國產原料絡繹運滬　由各業公會負責配給　各工廠已紛紛增加生產</h3>

<p>小型工廠雨後春筍</p>

<h3>各公會助當局　抑平物價</h3>

<p>至於其內容詳情，固不宜妾加推測，但小倉團長與新聞記者問答，商統會唐理事長於歡迎使節團時之致辭，明石照男氏談話，均値得爲吾人注目，小倉團長在答復新聞記者之間題時稱：完成大東亞戰爭之中心課題。無論就任何一方言，總不外爲處理中日關係，尤其爲處理經濟關係，此項問題能完全處理成功後，方有建設大東亞共榮圈之可能。新經濟政策亦以此爲出發點，新經濟政策能順利推進，則方可期中國產業的　主發展，從而有增强生產的希望，此種塲合，日本之資本或技術，可與中國之民族資本及人材合作，從資源着手，做到增產之一步，但其方法與企業姿態，尙有　華方充分檢討之必要。</p>
<p>據明石照男氏非正式發表見解稱：新經濟政策之本義，在於保護育成中國民族資本，民族資本提供可以活動之新分野，我人準備掃除一切妨碍此事之點，以便實行金融合作。</p>
<p>唐理事長，對中國經濟問題之見解如此：中日經濟提携，爲兩國政府之既定方針，其具體問題即爲中日經濟人互諒互信、同時又在於確立中國之健全經濟基礎，唯有如此，方足以促使中國經濟之自主發展，並能增强生產，但實行此舉之時，對於民生須有最低限度之保證。</p>
<p>此次使節團與華方經濟人，關於如何使新政策之原則具體化、曾坦白交換意見，某中國經濟人對於此次中日經濟界之懇談，認爲今後在處理經濟問題上，希望日方經濟人率直表示意見，祗此數言，可見華方經濟界對使節團來華期待之如何殷切了。（雲鵬：譯自七月十二日尺陸新報）（完）</p>

<h3>自信與固執</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>有人說：「自信是成功　事業；所以，自信力强的人，往往是示來事業的成功者。」這句話從正的方面看是確切的；但，假如我們從相反方面一瞧，便可以聽見破綻了。因爲「自信力」强的人往往是秉性「固執」者，他們常常不肯虛懷若谷地接受他人的忠告；不肯平心靜氣地體味他人的指摘；把自己看得像天一樣的織白崇高…這種人很不易結交得朋友，獲得旁人的幫助。反之，他們會受到種種無須有的挫折，因而被人淘汰，自食不幸的後果。</p>
<p>可是，話由得說囘來。對於事業百折不囘的「固執」精神是可貴的。是値得我們稱道的，當進行一件工作時我們必須固執地再接再厲，才會得到非常的成就。我們要固執地輕視他人的非笑，我們要固執地不辭艱難困苦用大無畏的精神去獲得所希望的有意義的「人生」。</p>
<p>平常，我們不妨變通一些，多吸收點人家的長處。而當非常時期時，要不怕嗤笑，固執地發揮出最大的力量來。</p>
<h3>評「歌衫情絲」</h3>
<p>— 穆華</p>
<p>「歌衫情絲」的劇本，是「滿江紅」的改編。劇情的發展，是南京一個紅歌女愛上了一個窮書家，其中迭經誤會，以致兩人各走極端。後來終於雙方先後明白，一個是替她解了結婚的圍，一個却因此而冒險救了他的命，於是淸凉山上大團圓，結束了全局。在整個劇本的觀點上，或者是每個情節的表現耳，都不能否認多少還帶有點「鴛鴦蝴蝶」的色彩。</p>
<p>不過話又得說囘頭，如果我們拿孫敬過去導演的幾部片子來比較，那麽「歌衫情絲」在這許多片子當中，還算是進步的，全劇的處理並無有給人失望，雖然導演的手法，還有許多商榷的地方。例如：童芷苓　棄的來囘淸凉山下，達數次之多，而竞以同一鏡頭來處理，使人看了沒有新鮮活潑的感覺，幾乎會疑心到是一個鏡頭多洗了數次一樣的呆板。</p>
<p>演員的演技，以梅熹演得最爲老練精湛，失戀時的煩惱悲憤的情緒以及公然出認爲童芷苓丈夫的神情，演來恰到好處，童芷苓的對白及歌唱，聲調嫌太平衡，缺少感情的流露，唯有幾個撥辣沉着的鏡頭，倒是虎虎有色，其餘呂玉堃等還算稱職。</p>
<p>和「言縣珠」的逃婚一般，「歌衫情絲」染上了濃厚的京劇色彩。</p>

<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>張參謀心裏相着，這個人倒是　燭，不點不　的，要不是硬着頭皮挺撞一番，今夜的事決不會便宜。他祇顧錢到手，不管人家的血腥氣的。邊想邊就順着×司令的推换走出了門，轉過潛囘到李鎭長的一間。李陸兩人担着今晚的事不容易解決，張參謀去了多時還不見囘來，總是凶多吉少，正在担憂，驀地瞥見斜角裏一個黑影掠向面前過來，黯淡的神情，好像頗有得色，心事一塊石放下了一半，就迎上半步</p>
<p>「張參謀，累你辛苦了！司令可答應了嗎」李鎭長低聲的問着，張參謀微露笑容，不就囘答，站定了脚，反過頭來望望那屋角裏垂頭喪氣着的阿坤，慢呑呑的說道：</p>
<p>「還好！總算答應了！不過很險呀！」</p>
<p>李鎭長聽了，一時還不領會，可是聽到「總算答應了」的話，心裏又放下一半。接着又問道：</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？還有什麽條件沒有？司令怎麽說的？」</p>
<p>「是很多，我改天詳細的告訴你吧！今晚我們先把這件事結束了，時侯已經不早，多躭擱了恐怕還有變化。我們到這邊屋子裏去談吧！」張參謀說着，就引導李陸兩人走過另外一間屋子，這裏有兩個舖子，一只桌子，幾條木長凳，是張參謀的臥室，三個人圍着桌子坐下，張先說道：</p>
<p>「我們別的空話不多說了，還是老老實實吧　司令已經答應，由我全權做去。我也明白你們兩位的苦處，同時阿坤的確很窮，不過司令那裏，總要有一個面子的，就算剛才李鎭長所說的　目，拿去給他，還有外邊弟兄們的犒賞，請你們稍稍再想法一些，這樣今晚就可以出去，李鎭長以爲怎樣？」</p>
<p>「謝謝張參謀的幫忙，這裏，」李解疑釋惑一邊說，一邊伸手摸出身邊的鈔票「一共八百元錢，我們也預備弟兄們的犒賞，就請張參謀收下吧！六百元「孝敬」司令，其餘二百元給弟兄們枝烟抽抽，差不多了嗎？另外張參謀幫忙的地方，我們明天自然要重重的酬謝。…哈！…哈！」李鎭長說完話，流露着笑聲。張參謀把鈔票收下，站起身說：</p>
<p>「請你們稍待，我去去就來。」說完往外，不一刻囘進屋子，笑容滿面的說：</p>
<p>「你們可以囘去了！此刻稍坐，待招呼阿坤來了，同去吧！（十）</p>

        <h1>1943.07.14</h1>
<h3>Kursk, Sicily, and the South Pacific</h3>
<p>The calm before the storm has finally ended, and the summer offensive of 1943 has already begun. As we predicted, the war in Europe has first erupted on the German-Soviet battlefield. On July 5th, a large-scale battle centered on the Kursk battlefield began. Although the German side claims that the war was initiated by the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union claims it was initiated by the German side, the initiator is irrelevant to the future of the war. Given the current international situation, Germany does have an initiative advantage and has already broken through enemy lines in several locations, seizing several key strongholds. This has been acknowledged by the Soviet side. The trend of the war is now in full swing, and we are unable to make accurate inferences based on scattered battles. Considering the nearly half-year preparation by both sides and their cautious attitude in combat operations and official war reports, it is conceivable that this year's war will be the most arduous and the most difficult to win in the short term for either side. They are bound to undergo the longest hard struggle. On the German side, based on the experience of the summer offensives in 1941 and 1942, they will certainly not regard territorial gains as victory but will focus their combat efforts on annihilating the Red Army's combat power, while also striving to use political warfare to assist military warfare to achieve decisive results. Of course, on the Soviet side, they are still attempting to delay the war until winter arrives. Therefore, they may still be trying to avoid large-scale battles. However, the Axis powers are certainly aware of this strategy. Judging from the German force in the Kursk front, which is as large as the force used to capture Stalingrad last year, the Red Army will be forced to concentrate their forces to be annihilated. Therefore, whether the Red Army's above-mentioned attempt can be realized is still a big question.</p>
<p>Not long after the arduous battle on the German-Soviet battlefield began, Soviet public opinion expressed its final and most blatant protest against the failure of Britain and the United States to open a second front in a timely manner. At the same time, the Soviet ambassador to Britain, Maisky, hurriedly returned home, and American public opinion rose up against Roosevelt and Churchill. Strike movements became serious again. Amidst this chorus of criticism, the anti-Axis military authorities hastily launched the landing operation on Sicily. Fierce fighting is taking place in the southeastern corner of Sicily. The Axis forces are taking advantage of their air superiority to strike at the support units and transport ships of the British, American, and Canadian landing forces. If the anti-Axis forces cannot maintain their supply lines, then the annihilation of the landing forces will naturally be only a matter of time. Now, the world's attention may, in addition to Sicily, also be focused on other parts of the northern Mediterranean coast. Alternatively, some people worry about whether any accidents will occur in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. However, if one considers the strength of the anti-Axis forces – especially their manpower and support capabilities – it can be said that this worry is unfounded. Moreover, on the other side of the issue, we must also see the defensive strength of the Axis powers. Are Britain and the United States so foolish as to risk their national fortunes on a single gamble and truly open a "second front" in Western Europe? This remains doubtful, because attacking fortified positions has been avoided as much as possible in the military histories of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The decisive force in the war mainly depends on the Axis powers' rear, the current state of total mobilization of manpower and materials, and whether its future development can meet the new needs of future war developments. The most fundamental element is whether the military industrial productivity can have the upper hand. In this regard, based on the current situation, the Axis powers occupy a great advantage. If the future war in Europe develops in the northwest, west, or southeast, from a geographical point of view, it can also be asserted that the future situation will favor the Axis powers. This is because, once the troops of Britain, the United States, and Canada land anywhere in Europe, their consumption of personnel and ammunition will be several times higher than the defense side, according to general war experience, and the urgency of their need for replenishment goes without saying. Assuming that Britain, the United States, Canada, and North Africa have considerable replenishment capabilities (it seems that Britain and the United States have been working hard on this in the past six months), the most serious problem still lies in ocean transportation. Not long ago, in June, Churchill admitted in his first report after returning to Britain from the United States that the main content of future operations is still anti-submarine warfare, which shows his anxiety about the supply problem once they land in Europe. On the Axis side, it is completely the opposite. They can boldly open the rat-catching bag without fearing it will not go deep! Because the war is being waged in Europe, why worry that European manpower and resources will not be used to defend Europe?</p>
<p>What cannot be ignored is the war in the Pacific. Around the German-Soviet front and the Sicily landing, the Australian and American forces in and around Australia launched a "counter-offensive" against New Guinea and the surrounding islands. This stirring can, to some extent, be exaggerated as the prelude to a major Pacific counter-offensive, or, in reality, it is only a disruptive guerrilla warfare, attempting to use an "offensive" to hinder Japan's possible new offensive, taking advantage of the tense situation in Europe. Considering that the "counter-offensive" targets of the anti-Axis forces are particularly focused on islands within the outer perimeter of Australia, it can be clearly seen that the above-mentioned second strategic assessment is correct. To be honest, although the United States has placed the largest part of its national military strength and almost all of its naval power in the Pacific, and although it has boasted about preparations for a total Pacific counter-offensive in all international military and diplomatic talks, in reality, it has not regained its confidence in a victorious counter-offensive since the severe blow suffered in the Pearl Harbor attack. Therefore, their recent disturbances in the Pacific are no more than an act of inner weakness, completely passive and negative. However, does this mean that East Asians do not need to be more vigilant against the enemy today? That is absolutely necessary. Always standing in a proactive and superior position, and striking the enemy without losing the opportunity, is the strategic center of defending East Asia and also the basic requirement for realizing the Axis world strategy. At a time when Prime Minister Tojo of our friendly nation was in charge of all affairs of state, he personally visited Nanyang, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines for the second time to assist the independence efforts of Burma and the Philippines, and the Indian independence movement centered on Chandra Bose, establishing a second anti-British front in West Asia. These new developments can explain that as the storm in Europe begins to shake people's hearts, the liberation movements of the Eastern nations will embark on a new stage, and the total collapse of the Anglo-American imperialist forces should be at its core.</p>

<h3>Naval Battle off Kolombangara Island: Three American Cruisers Sunk. Daytime Bombing of Rentepao Port and New Georgia Island: Great War Results Achieved by Japanese Naval and Air Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 13th: (1) After the enemy forces landed in several locations on New Georgia Island on July 5th, they advanced toward Munda from both the north and south. The Japanese garrison is bravely counterattacking. (2) In response to this, the Japanese naval mine warfare squadron engaged with more than four enemy cruisers that had moved toward that area during operations in the waters north of Kolombangara Island on the night of the 12th. Two of the cruisers were sunk and one was damaged, causing them to retreat. (3) One Japanese cruiser was heavily damaged. (Note) This naval battle is called the Night Battle of Kolombangara Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:30 PM on the 13th: Japanese naval aviation units attacked Rentepao Port on July 9th, engaging 20 enemy aircraft. As a result, five were shot down and six landing craft were sunk. On July 11th, joint formations of fighter and bomber aircraft attacked enemy forces landing in the northwest of New Georgia Island, engaging 40 enemy "P.38" fighter aircraft. Twenty-four were shot down, while three Japanese aircraft failed to return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – An authoritative source here said: After the American forces in the Solomon Islands landed on Rentepao Island on June 30th, in an attempt to seize New Georgia Island adjacent to that island, they landed not only on Rubiana Island in the southeast of New Georgia Island and several other locations, but also attempted to land north of Kula Gulf. One had already landed at Billoko in Rice Bay and was advancing, intending to attack the Japanese base at Munda from both the north and south. However, since July 5th, the Japanese army and navy garrison units have suddenly taken the counter-offensive, and Japanese aircraft have been dispatched to assist in the battle. At the moment, the American and Japanese sides are continuing to engage in fierce fighting in that area. At the same time, the Japanese mine warfare squadron, in cooperation with the army and navy, had already sunk and damaged enemy cruisers, destroyers and special service ships, a total of six ships, in the Kula Gulf night battle on the 4th and 5th, achieving great results. Now, on the night of the 12th, in the north of Kolombangara Island. Again, they encountered four American cruisers that had been dispatched to protect the landing of boats, and immediately engaged in a fierce night battle with them, launching torpedoes to attack the enemy ships. Three enemy cruisers were sunk and another cruiser was hit by a torpedo and caught fire. It fled in panic. In this battle, one Japanese cruiser was damaged, which proves the intensity of the night battle on the sea off Kolombangara Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The air war in the southwestern Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. On July 9th, during the day, the Japanese naval aviation units again used joint large formations of fighter and bomber aircraft to bomb the heavily guarded Rentepao Port, engaging in a fierce aerial battle with enemy fighters guarding inside and outside the port. As a result, five enemy aircraft were shot down, and bombs were dropped to bombard the landing craft parked in the port, sinking six of them. On July 11th, the same large formation continued to attack New Georgia Island, fiercely bombing the enemy forces landing on the northwest coast of the island, in the area of Tons Bay, north of Billoko. These enemy forces had already suffered heavy damage in the night battle of Kula Gulf. After this bombing, the losses were considerable. Japanese aircraft also engaged 40 enemy "P.38" Vought Sikorsky fighter aircraft in a reconnaissance battle, shooting down twenty-four of them, achieving great results. Three Japanese aircraft have not yet returned.</p>

The talks lasted approximately two hours.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese-Chinese economic delegation has been warmly welcomed by all sectors of society in our country since arriving in Nanjing, and has been very busy with social events these days. To thank our country for its warm hospitality and friendship, the delegation held a tea party at the International Club yesterday (13th) at 7:00 PM to invite government officials and prominent figures from the private sector, including Zhou Fohai, Wen Zongyao, Chu Minyi, Xu Suzhou, Ding Mocun, Zhou Xuechang, Bao Wenyue, Chen Changzu, Li Ouyi, Zhang Tao, Jiang Xuan, Chen Zhishuo, Yuan Yujian, Ma Xiaotian, Ge Liangchou, etc., as well as Mr. Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor from our friendly nation Japan, Rear Admiral Teraoka, the embassy's information department, the military police, and the commanders of various units, and Lv Ronghuan, the ambassador of Manchuria, and over a hundred other people. They gathered together, and were hosted by the hosts, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, and others. The guests and hosts had a pleasant time and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Deputy Chairman of the National Economic Committee, Chu Minyi, Mei Shiping, Gu Baoheng, Chen Zhishuo, and others held a banquet at the International Club at noon on the 13th to welcome the Japanese Economic Survey Group, led by Mr. Ogura. Twelve people were invited, including Chen Qun, Minister of Interior of the National Government, Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda, Zhou Jiangxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zi Yujian, Vice Minister of Industry, Jiang Zuoyi, Vice Minister of Construction, Huang Yuan, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, Guo Liang, Director of General Affairs of the Central Bank, as well as the various economic advisors after Ishiwatari, Counselor Ishii of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Shimizu, and several dozen other people. During the banquet, Deputy Chairman Zhou gave a welcoming speech, expressing unlimited expectations and fervent hopes for the group's visit to China for investigation. Mr. Ogura then gave a reply, and the guests and hosts were extremely delighted. Yesterday, the 13th, was the second day of the group's visit to Nanjing. The group members visited Yuhuatai Martyrs' Shrine and the site of battle at 8:00 AM, and at 10:00 AM, they went to the guesthouse to attend a symposium with Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Chairman Ogura Delivers a Speech. Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese economic delegation paid a long visit to General Commander Hata of the Japanese Expeditionary Force Headquarters at 2:20 PM yesterday (13th), before departing. At 3:30 PM, they met with reporters at the Capital Hotel and expressed their impressions after arriving in China. Chairman Ogura answered the reporters' questions on current Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in great detail. The main points are as follows: (Question) The Japanese economic delegation stayed in Shanghai for many days and held talks with various parties. What were the contents and what were the gains? What are your impressions of China's economic situation after the war? (Answer) Our delegation first visited Shanghai and held talks with local government officials, people, and financial circles, and gained a lot. The content was nothing more than discussing how to strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. China's economic situation after the war is showing a revival phenomenon, which is more cooperative for the future of the Greater East Asia War. (Question) What are your views on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? (Answer) Under the wartime system, if we want to win the war, we must strengthen our combat power. The prerequisite for strengthening combat power is to strengthen economic power. Japan launched the war to destroy the British and Americans, and China also continued to participate in the war. During this war, it is necessary to strengthen economic power. It is not enough to rely on Japan alone, so it is also necessary to strengthen China's economic power. In strengthening combat power, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is the easiest to achieve. Not only China, but also all countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must have economic cooperation. The exchange of rice from Vietnam and Thailand with materials from Central and Southern China, if realized, can be effective. What is urgently needed now is the issue of ship transportation. (Question) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation focuses on the exchange of materials between China and Japan. What are your good methods for the exchange of materials between China and Japan? (Answer) China has many abundant wartime materials and also has those in great need. The same is true in Japan, so the exchange of materials between China and Japan is necessary. The Japanese authorities are currently seriously considering this and will implement it fully within the possible scope. (Question) What is the current state of affairs of the East Asia Economic Symposium? (Answer) The mission of the Economic Symposium is quite important. In the future, we must make the meeting more active in order to achieve its important mission.</p>
<p>Minister Chu to Host a Banquet This Afternoon. Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese economic survey group arrived in Nanjing, they held talks with various parties.

<h3>German Forces Achieve Strategic Success on the Eastern Front; Soviet Flank Attack Stopped</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – Today's communique from the German High Command states: Under the cover of the Luftwaffe, the German forces have achieved further progress north of Belgorod after defeating two large groups of Soviet tank corps. The counter-offensive of the Soviet infantry and tank units and the fierce attacks in the east and north of Orel have collapsed, with heavy losses. Yesterday, German forces destroyed another 400 Soviet tanks. At the same time, 103 enemy aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the Huitong News Agency declared: The intensity of the fighting in the Belgorod and Orel areas has increased during the past week, but has not yet reached its peak. The Soviet offensive power has weakened, but its resistance is still quite strong. The German forces have not yet achieved a decisive victory in the immediate future, but the German offensive is strategically important and does not rush for quick progress. The biggest goal at present is to eliminate the Soviet salient area in the Kursk direction. According to the Soviet forces in that area, they had planned an offensive, so the concentration of troops and military supplies was very strong. The Soviet side originally intended to launch an offensive at the same time as the British and American offensive in Sicily, so as to inflict a major blow on the Axis powers. Now, this plan has been broken by the German offensive. The German command knew its intentions and made a plan to contain the enemy forces, forcing the troops that were originally intended to be used for the offensive to switch to the defensive. Therefore, the German operation in Kursk has now completed its greatest task. Those who are unaware may think that the Battle of Kursk is only of secondary significance. But strategically, the German command is already satisfied with the current results. Although the enemy claims that our losses are heavy, they do not know that their losses are actually greater than ours. In the first five days of the battle, Soviet General Vikosovky tried his best to send tank corps from both the east and west to outflank the German armored vanguard, attempting to cut off its retreat. However, the German command had already anticipated this and adopted a completely new defensive strategy, applying new weapons to resist tanks, severely damaging the attacking Soviet tank forces. According to the German announcement yesterday, more than 1,640 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. Last weekend, the Soviet army used its remaining tank units to launch a positional war to block the momentum of the German vanguard, causing the German advance from Belgorod to slow down slightly, but it did not come to a standstill. The German military’s “attrition” strategy can be said to have been successful. The Soviet flank attack had to stop. According to the German communique on the 12th, the Soviet army lost a total of 1,400 cannons. The combat operation itself was affected, but the Soviet strength south of Orel is still very strong.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 12th: The results achieved by the German forces in the Orel area since the 5th are as follows: 24,000 enemy soldiers captured, 1,540 enemy tanks seized and destroyed, and 14,000 guns and cannons captured.</p>
<h3>Tang Yinghuang Discusses Adjusting Judicial Administration: A Plan for Innovation After the Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - To understand the judicial situation after the recovery of concessions, this reporter visited Vice Minister Tang of the Judicial Administration Department. He graciously received me and engaged in a question-and-answer discussion, as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) After the abolition of extraterritoriality, will there be reforms to China's judicial system? (Answer) Reforming the judicial system has always been a government policy. Since Minister Luo took office, he has been working hard to promote it. The reform plan does not begin only with the abolition of extraterritoriality. Improvements to the judicial system will be even more vigorous due to the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, so that the current system becomes more complete. (Question) What is the current state of court facilities in China? (Answer) The practice of county magistrates concurrently handling judicial matters is an abnormal system. The Ministry is determined to abolish county judicial offices and the concurrent handling of judicial affairs by county magistrates, and to establish district courts and their branches as soon as possible. This is being actively promoted and implemented. In the first phase, the following have been reorganized and established: the Jiading Branch of the Shanghai District Court, the Jiading Branch of the Shanghai District Procuratorate, the Taicang Branch of the Kunshan District Court, the Taicang Branch of the Kunshan District Procuratorate, the Shaoxing Branch of the Hang County District Court, the Shaoxing Branch of the Hang County District Procuratorate, the Haining Tribunal of the Hang County District Court, the Dangtu Tribunal of the Wuhu District Court, etc. Other counties where district courts or branches are to be established will be promoted in stages in the near future to cope with the abolition of extraterritoriality. (Question) After the complete abolition of extraterritoriality, will all foreign-related litigation cases be handled by Chinese courts? (Answer) Of course, they will be handled by our courts. The Provisional Regulations on the Exercise of Jurisdiction over Foreigners' Litigation have been drafted and are under review. (Question) How will the courts be adjusted after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions? (Answer) After the recovery of the concessions, Shanghai's judicial affairs should be handled by the local courts under a unified system. Prosecutors who have been unable to fully exercise their powers due to treaty restrictions over the years will be strengthened and invigorated under the dual circumstances of the return of the concessions and the expansion of the procuratorial system. (Question) Has our legal system reached a perfect stage? What new legal systems are planned to be drafted recently? (Answer) Our legal system is now largely complete, but some areas need to be added or revised. For example, the drafting of the Non-Litigation Event Procedures, the revision of the Law Application Regulations, and the translation of foreign laws are being carried out by a Law Compilation Committee specially established by the Ministry, which has hired expert members to conduct substantive reviews. (Question) What are the plans for foreign prisons? (Answer) The director of the Ministry's Prison Affairs Department inspected prisons in various places last month and has drafted a detailed plan. Shanghai and Hankou have been ordered to prepare prisons for foreigners. The Ministry has repeatedly and strictly improved the improvement of prisons, the improvement of prisoner life, the improvement of internal equipment, and the supervision of prisoner work. Considerable progress has been made. (Question) Are there any plans to improve the judicial police? (Answer) Since the reform of the procuratorial system, training judicial police has been the focus of the fundamental reorganization of the judiciary. Strict organization must be added to ensure flexible dispatch. Especially after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, a sound judicial police force can cooperate with the administrative departments to become an important institution for maintaining social order.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Achievements in Central and Southern Hebei</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese army's mopping-up operations in central and southern Hebei are continuing. In June, there were a total of 186 engagements with the Chongqing army. The total number of Chongqing army troops involved was 21,824. 744 were captured, and 1,619 bodies were left behind. The Japanese army seized 4 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 788 light machine guns, 1,681 rifles, and many other automatic rifles, pistols, hand grenades, and mortars.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the American Race Problem</h3>
<p>The recent incident of oppression of Black people in Detroit, the largest military industrial city in the United States, has indeed focused the world's attention. This is by no means an accidental event. The inconsistency of the so-called "cancer of the United States," the race problem, will inevitably erupt in such incidents when it touches the friction point of domestic disputes in the United States on the road to decisive battle. At the same time, it fully exposes the fundamental defects and contradictions of democracy without freedom, equality, and justice, as well as the insatiable ambition of Anglo-Saxon imperialism and the bestial barbarity of Americans. This is truly a noteworthy event.</p>
<p>The History of Oppressing Black People President Roosevelt has been racking his brains since this war to find a suitable war goal. Some say that this war is a war for democracy, a war for survival, and they have also raised the banner of fighting for four freedoms—namely, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from terror, and freedom from want. But these are only superficially pleasing terms; in fact, they are means to satisfy the desires of the Anglo-Saxons themselves. Their so-called freedom, equality, and justice are denied to all other countries and all those who violate the interests of different races and their own countries. The incident of oppressing Black people is precisely this trick of the Americans burying their heads in the sand.</p>
<p>This riot occurred near the Detroit coast, originating from the murder of a young Black woman by a white man, which eventually escalated into a race war. It is reported that Roosevelt dispatched fully armed troops to gradually suppress it. However, the root of this problem can be traced back to the exclusive instinct inherent in American history from before the founding of the United States to the present.</p>
<p>There are now 13 million Black people in the United States, accounting for about one-tenth of the total population of 132 million. These Black people are the descendants of Black people who have been driven together by British and Americans since the early 17th century, using the same means as hunting wild beasts, and imported into the Americas as slaves. These indigenous people had shackles locked on their feet, two people were chained together, and they were transported to the Americas in slave ships. During the months of sailing, they were imprisoned in wooden cages on the deck and in the cabins, unable to move, and they relieved themselves on the spot. Therefore, many died of illness or went mad. Tens of thousands of people were transported to the Americas every year until 250 years later, when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1884. The total number of Black slaves in the United States was 4.5 million.</p>
<p>Slaves were unloaded in the New York harbor area and sold for tens to thousands of dollars per person. They were still chained, whipped, and forced to engage in cotton farming or other strenuous labor. All masters regarded them as cattle and horses. To prevent them from escaping, they often branded their own marks on the backs of Black people with iron. This fact alone is enough to deny the humanity of Americans. They have subjected Japanese, Chinese, Irish, German, Italian, Scandinavian, Slavic, Greek, and Mexican people who later immigrated to the United States to all kinds of torture, abuse, violence, and forced expulsion. History can prove this.</p>
<p>Driven into the Army and Factories Although Black people were legally emancipated from slavery during the era of President Lincoln in 1886, this was only a formality. They were only freed from shackles but were still subjected to the same abuse and oppression as slaves.</p>
<p>Let's look at two or three specific examples: First, the number of Black people who have been abused and killed by lynchings carried out by white mobs has reached more than 3,400. After the outbreak of this war, the Roosevelt government adopted various benevolent policies to alleviate the difficulty of human resources and strengthen domestic control, in order to promote the formation of Black troops or massively mobilize Black laborers to work in military production. For example, the US Navy recently announced that it would name a newly commissioned destroyer after Louis Harmon, a Black soldier who died in the Battle of Guadalcanal. However, this is only a nominal honor. Black people are subjected to absolute discrimination in the military, in military factories, and in general national life. Secretary of War Stimson once boasted that he would form a Black army of 900,000 people. The training these Black people receive is different from that of white troops, and their food and other treatment are extremely poor. They are often despised and excluded by white troops, and bloody tragedies often occur due to conflicts. On the battlefield, they are also driven to take on the most dangerous battles and areas. As a result, under the empty name of democracy, they become sacrifices for the white people.</p>
<p>Still Regarded as Slaves</p>
<p>The US Navy has never employed Black people. After the outbreak of this war, in order to make up for the shortage of personnel, it employed some Black people, but they were only assigned to lower-level tasks at naval bases and were not allowed to serve on ships with white people. In military factories, Black people are a powerful human resource, but white laborers are unwilling to work alongside Black people. Racial disputes are often heard everywhere. In March last year, a Black people oppression riot occurred in Detroit, and thousands of police officers were dispatched to suppress it. However, white people wanted to use violence to suppress the relocation of Black laborers and their families who were employed in military factories. Therefore, many labor organizations did not admit Black people as members. The largest labor organization in the United States, the A.F.L. (American Federation of Labor), openly excluded them. The general public's differential treatment of Black people is most evident in the low wages used to exploit Black people who engage in inferior manual labor. In daily social life, Black people are never allowed to sit at the same table in any situation. In the southern states with large Black populations, Black people are segregated or prohibited from entering all places such as cars, trams, buses, hotels, hospitals, theaters, cinemas, bars, toilets, schools, and libraries. In major cities from Washington to New York, Black people are not allowed to enter theaters, cinemas, hospitals, hotels, bars, dance halls, elevators, and other places where white people enter and exit. Even most Christian churches in the United States do not allow Black people to enter. Americans, who preach justice, freedom, and equality, even have such hypocritical behavior before God. Recently, the American Red Cross refused to accept condolence letters sincerely sent by Black people to army wounded soldiers' hospitals. The London magazine "New Statesman and Nation" published an article commenting on the American Black problem a few days ago, saying that the humiliation that the United States inflicts on Black people is causing increasing resentment among Black people. The United States is troubled and distressed in the war whirlpool it has brought upon itself. Taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, all 13 million Black people in the United States have awakened their national consciousness and resolutely raised the banner of liberation.

<h3>German Planes Attack England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the German Air Force bombed eastern England on the night of the 12th.</p>
<h3>Top Communist Leaders Hold Emergency Meeting to Discuss Response to Chongqing's Demands</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reliable sources: After the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received the article from Chongqing (the Supreme National Defense Council) requesting that the Communist regime in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region be returned to Chongqing and that the 18th Group Army be transferred to another location, Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Zhang Wentian, Qian Jiaji, and other top Communist leaders held consultations. As a result, it was decided to convene a temporary emergency meeting of the heads of the party, government, and military. Zhu De, Lin Biao, He Long, and other frontline Communist generals have all been summoned to Yan'an one after another. The top Communist leaders are aware of the seriousness of the situation, so they are proceeding with extreme caution. The final policy will be decided by a vote of all party members, so this move will determine the future fate of the Chinese Communist Party. In addition, Yan'an does not seem to have any specific expressions to Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, and other Communist representatives stationed in Chongqing. In addition, the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party and the cadres of the Communist army, such as Zhu De, He Long, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, and other Communist military cadres, admit that Chongqing's demands are not only intended to immediately eliminate the power of the Chinese Communist Party in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, but also to oppress the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the 18th Group Army. Therefore, the backbone of the Chinese Communist Party advocated rejecting Chongqing's demands and proposed counter-conditions to Chongqing (the Supreme National Defense Council). Moreover, the attitude of the Communist military cadres is even tougher, saying that if Chongqing uses military high-pressure tactics, they will not hesitate to sacrifice the national united front and resort to force. Judging from this situation, without waiting for the decision of the temporary emergency meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be inferred that the Chinese Communist Party will refuse Chongqing's demands.</p>
<p>Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the dissolution of the Communist International, Chongqing immediately intensified its pressure on the Chinese Communist Party by air. According to recent news obtained from the local area, Chongqing's military pressure on the central area of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has greatly increased. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party suddenly felt embarrassed and took a confrontational stance against the Chongqing army with the Communist army in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Xiao Jinguang, the director of the rear guard of the 18th Group Army and the commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, also issued a telegram to the generals of the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing army who insisted on the encirclement, as follows: "It is rumored that Chongqing intends to launch a large-scale attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. However, at this time of national survival, another civil war will be launched. It is truly heartbreaking. For six years, the 18th Group Army has received no supplies. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is our only rear base. A small number of guards are responsible for defense work and engage in production and education. This is well known. Now, when a civil war is breaking out in the country, the future of the country and the nation is truly unthinkable. Domestic problems should be resolved by political methods. Therefore, it is hoped that all generals will seek a solution by peaceful means," etc., in order to alleviate Chongqing's oppression of the Chinese Communist Party. However, on the other hand, they are still instigating the Twenty-Four Banners and the Ordos League to launch a counter-offensive movement to disrupt the order in the rear. Judging from this, the full-scale struggle between Chongqing and the Communist Party in the northwestern border region may become increasingly fierce.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhongji Rewards Trainees in Training Camp</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The trainees of the New National Patriotic Movement's civil servants and youth corps training camps have been working hard since entering the camp on the 1st of this month, following the training of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. Former Chairman Zeng Congying gave a speech, expressing his satisfaction with the spirit of the trainees. It is learned that Central Committee member Bi Jun visited the camp earlier and greatly praised the trainees for training in this hot weather. Yesterday afternoon, the 13th, he specially donated 650 catties of salted meat to the trainees of the two camps to supplement their dinner. The trainees of the two camps were very grateful.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on Sicily Continues: Axis Forces Recapture Airfield</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command announced today: Fierce fighting is continuing on Sicily. The Axis air force is constantly participating in the ground battle and attacking the enemy's landing fleet off the coast of the island, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Twenty-five enemy planes were shot down over Sicily and Sardinia.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German authorities announced on the 12th: The German-Italian defense forces on Sicily severely attacked the British-American forces that landed on the southeast coast of the island on the afternoon of the 11th, inflicting heavy casualties. The Italian army also repelled the American forces that landed on the south coast and advanced westward to the coast. The anti-Axis forces only maintain their original positions in other locations. In order to continue the landing operations, the enemy must still dispatch a large number of reinforcements, but because the enemy did not benefit in the initial stage of the operation, even if they reinforce their forces to attack in the future, they will only be sacrificed in vain. In addition, the German authorities reiterated the battle situation on Sicily on the night of the 12th, saying that the area of the coastal area occupied by the anti-Axis forces on Sicily has been shrinking due to the fierce attacks of the Axis forces. From the overall situation of the war, after three days of fierce fighting, the area occupied by the anti-Axis forces is only a narrow coastal area in southeastern Sicily. The airborne troops are also completely unsupported and have abandoned their positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German authorities announced on the 12th: Since the 11th, the Axis forces on Sicily have dispatched superior forces to annihilate the anti-Axis parachute troops. By the 12th, they had occupied Gela Bay, a key area on the south coast of Sicily, recaptured the airfield occupied by the anti-Axis paratroopers, and annihilated two anti-Axis teams.</p>
<p>The Battle Situation in Two Days</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The military visitor of Haitong News Agency, Captain Saito Cox, declared: As of Monday afternoon, the news of the situation on Sicily obtained here knows that the war there is limited to a corner of the southeast. Furthermore, when the Axis forces attacked the southeast coast of Sicily, there were a total of two armies, one British army, responsible for capturing the cape of Cologne and Brazil, one American and assisted by Canadian troops to take charge of invading the beach from Licata to the Skaramy corner. The strategy of the British and Americans' action is to focus on a concentrated effort to encircle the German and Italian troops stationed in the southeast mountainous area of Sicily, or to force them to quickly retreat from the line of Arbarema Catania, so that the southeast part of the island has no German or Italian troops. According to the news of the situation on the island heard on Sunday afternoon, it can be seen that the anti-Axis forces are still very far from this goal. The British army has only been able to occupy a narrow coastal area from Syracuse to Brazil Cape, about five to ten kilometers in depth, and the American army has so far only been able to obtain a few bridgeheads as strongholds. On the weekend, these two anti-Axis armies attempted to quickly advance inland with the landed troops in order to meet with the paratroopers, but only a few paratroopers who landed near the coast succeeded. The majority of those who landed inland were annihilated by the Italian army.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles at Gela Port The defensive actions of the German and Italian reserve forces on Sunday are noteworthy. They encountered the advance of the British army five to ten kilometers from the coast, and the American army's advance was also severely damaged and forced to retreat to its bridgehead between Licata and Gela. On Monday morning, fierce battles broke out between the two sides for Gela Port. Judging from the situation at noon on Monday, the commander-in-chief of the British army fighting between the Cape of Cologne and Brazil Corner seemed to intend to maintain the area it occupied before continuing to advance, and to use the landed troops as cover to continuously transport tanks, heavy artillery, and new troops to the shore. It is estimated here that there are now about four divisions of British troops that have landed, and the number of American troops that have landed on the south coast has also reached two divisions, including one division of Canadian troops. Because of the disastrous defeat at Gela, they are adding reinforcements. The anti-Axis forces still have a large number of reserves, and they have not yet used them all. There is no doubt that they can mobilize ships. It is not difficult for General Eisenhower to double the number of troops he has landed. The war on Sicily is still in the beginning stage, and Axis people believe that there will be extremely fierce battles in the near future.</p>
<p>Eisenhower Lands Once Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency News: The anti-Axis side said that the Axis Command is transferring the largest number of troops to the south. It has now been found that the Axis forces are the 4th Division of the Le Havre regiment, facing the American army north of Gela, and the 54th Division of Naples, holding against the British army near Syracuse. It is said that both of these troops have German assistance in combat. General Eisenhower, who is in charge of the anti-Axis forces in Sicily, drove a destroyer to land on the southeast coast of Sicily yesterday morning. According to Reuters, Eisenhower met with General Barton, the commander of the new US Seventh Army, and then left the island. The anti-Axis side's news about the situation on Sicily is generally cautious, and warns that the Axis Command will increase its resistance, so the most difficult task for the British and American armies is still to come.</p>
<p>US and British Troops Participating in the War The German News Agency said: The American troops fighting in Sicily include the 1st, 3rd, 45th Infantry and a part of the 2nd Tank Division, and a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. This unit forms the new US Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Barton. Barton was the commander of the US Fifth Army in the North African campaign. The British troops fighting in Sicily are the 5th Infantry Division, the 51st Division, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the 22nd Tank Brigade, and a part of the 6th Tank Division. The 1st Canadian Army was transferred from the United Kingdom to Sicily specifically for this operation. In addition, there are several battalions of British paratroopers participating in the operation. This unit is commanded by General Montgomery, who previously commanded the British Eighth Army in Libya and Tunisia. The anti-Axis Air Force is commanded by British Air Chief Marshal Sir Tedder, assisted by British Air Marshal Sir Cunningham, British Air Vice Marshal Lauter, US Lieutenant General Spaatz, and Major General Doolittle. The anti-Axis Navy is commanded by Admiral Sir Cunningham, and the US fleet commander is Lieutenant General Hewitt.</p>
<h3>Italian People United to Defend Their Homeland: US Acknowledges Difficulties in Invading Sicily: Turkish Political Circles Take a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from the Tong News Agency: A Rome-based qualified person commented on the Battle of Sicily, solemnly declaring: The Italian people are calmly dealing with the long-expected attack and are doing their best to defend the land of their ancestors with unwavering determination. Italians today have only one slogan: "The entire Italian nation is united under the leadership of the Prime Minister, determined to defend the sacred land of the Fatherland."</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Gheda announced in the Italian Daily that the anti-Axis forces landed in a remote coastal area of Sicily. The Axis forces there had withdrawn in advance to avoid the shelling of the anti-Axis ships. The Axis strategy is to lead the invading enemy forces into the inland and then fight them. The first anti-Axis forces to land encountered fierce battles before the majority of the Axis forces joined the battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from the Tong News Agency: Confidence in the situation in Sicily is gradually increasing in Berlin and Rome, while the British side has become more cautious about the news of the landing. Berlin believes that the anti-Axis side probably launched an attack at this time, regardless of military interests, because the Soviet Union had issued an ultimatum demanding immediate action from the anti-Axis side. It is recalled that Prime Minister Churchill has repeatedly said that a military attack on Italy is of great political importance, and Eisenhower also underestimated the strength of the Italian army. This erroneous idea is the reason for the hasty attack on Sicily without being fully prepared.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A spokesman for the US Department of the Army announced in Washington yesterday: "We must be prepared to suffer severe losses in the battle of Sicily, because the battle there will be very difficult." The spokesman also said: "The well-trained and disciplined Axis forces will fight bravely and launch fierce counter-attacks. It is not easy to completely occupy Sicily."</p>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish political circles expressed doubts about whether the British and American landing in Sicily would satisfy the Soviet Union, because the fighting on the eastern Soviet front is extremely fierce. Therefore, it is believed here that the Soviet Union will demand more important action than the current attack on Sicily. The Turkish side has a deep impression of the fierce resistance on Sicily and is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the situation in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Battleship Hit</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - A Havas News Agency report, citing German air force personnel, states that one anti-Axis battleship involved in the invasion of Sicily was hit near the island's coast, emitting thick smoke. Other reports suggest that several of the transport ships rumored to have been damaged are now considered sunk.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spinning Machines Moved to Burma</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japan decided in April of this year on a large-scale outline plan to relocate spinning equipment to the South. According to related sources, a portion of Japanese spinning equipment has already arrived here based on that outline and is currently being installed, with operations expected to begin soon. The produced cotton will be supplied to Burmese handicraft industries. This relocation of Japanese spinning machines to Burma is the first of its kind and holds considerable promise for the future.</p>
<h3>Italian Lieutenant General Frances Dies in Action in Sicily</h3>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that, according to an official announcement yesterday, Lieutenant General Frances, commander of the 13th Blackshirt Legion and civil militia liaison officer for the Sicilian garrison, died in action on July 11th. He participated in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer and also served on the Soviet front during this war. He had been stationed in Sicily since March of last year.</p>
<h3>Promotion of Military Administration in the South Enters Second Phase, Construction Work in the Philippines Progressing Actively</h3>
<p>Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military administration is promoting military government in order to establish a self-sufficient system in various parts of the South, which has entered the second stage, and is strengthening its promotion in order to complete its objectives as soon as possible. Among these,</p>
<p>The people of the Philippines are preparing for their impending independence within this region, and are particularly active in carrying out construction work. Recognizing the Philippines' rich resources and its extremely important position within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Philippine military administration has focused its policy objectives on reorganizing the economy and decided to continue mining manganese, chromium, and other minerals. In the agricultural sector, the plan is to increase the production of Manila hemp, coconuts, dried tobacco leaves, timber, etc., and to shift the production goals of a portion of the Philippine sugar industry. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction and stabilize people's livelihoods, the decision was made to first promote a sugar production increase campaign to ensure self-sufficiency in local sugar supplies. Thanks to the efforts of the military administration over the past year, everything is now on the right track, and the authorities recognize that establishing a self-sufficient system in the Philippines is increasingly important, especially during this Greater East Asia War. This is because</p>
<p>Adapting to Independence and fulfilling its role as a logistics base for the Southern front, it is essential to achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Therefore, in March of this year, a five-year food production increase plan was established, focusing on increasing the production of rice and corn, the main food crops, as well as increasing the production of sweet potatoes, beans, and other grains, and entrusting the Philippine government to be responsible for its implementation. The Philippine administration also recognizes that establishing a self-sufficient food system in the Philippines is the foundation for completing Philippine economic independence and is a necessary condition for Philippine independence. Therefore, it mobilized all agricultural officials under the administration to go to various places to promote it. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce of the government has also increased the number of field instructors and used various propaganda materials to encourage farmers to pay attention. In May of this year, as the rainy season approached,</p>
<p>Food Production conferences were held separately in rice-producing provinces to discuss various issues such as selecting seeds, improving technology, reclaiming wasteland, and encouraging fertilization, and working with the New Philippine Service Corps to organize farmers to improve the land system. In terms of the production of daily necessities, factories for textiles, coconut oil, soap, paper making, and matches have also been restored, and domestic Japanese entrepreneurs have been entrusted to operate them. Factories participating in the organization through joint ventures have resumed work, striving to rationalize operations and improve production technology. The products are then distributed to general consumers through a rationing system by the essential goods distribution cooperative. The military administration and the Philippine government are working together to establish a plan to strengthen the industry. Recently, it was decided to transfer a portion of the factory equipment in Japan to the Philippines, so the output of the Philippine textile and paper industries will increase dramatically by three or four times. In addition, they are starting to</p>
<p>Increase the machinery equipment factory and fully restore factories for paint, sacks, cement, etc. The authorities also believe that in order to achieve practical results in this production plan, transportation is essential. Therefore, regarding transportation, all the original railways in the Philippines were repaired by March of this year, and plans are being made to add new lines. Regarding maritime transport, the main domestic routes are being restored, and wooden ships are being actively built locally using the rich timber resources of the Philippines. As the Philippines approaches independence, the progress of this work is also becoming increasingly rapid.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Officials Go to Beijing to Discuss Details of Returning the French Concession. After the recovery of the French Concession, all industries in the Nanshi area will become more prosperous.</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of taking over the French Concession, there have been several rounds of negotiations with satisfactory results. The French Ambassador, Ambassador Gu, and Foreign Minister Chu have all gone to Beijing one after another to continue negotiations on agreements and details of the handover. According to recent inquiries from relevant parties, Foreign Ministry Counselor Nong Rihui, Section Chief Sun Lifu, Secretary Tian Shoucheng, Minister Zhang Chao, and Geng Jizhi and others from our country left Shanghai by train at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the details of the return of the French Concession in Beijing, which will be implemented soon, and to continue to promote the work with Minister Chu.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the return of the Public Concession of this city is imminent, and the handover of the French Concession is also expected to be implemented within a short period of time. The news spread, and the citizens of the southern district were all inspired. It is known that the Nanshi area, which is adjacent to the French Concession, has been threatened by the forces of the concession for many years. Especially after the closure of the iron gate after the war, traffic was blocked, which not only caused inconvenience for pedestrians entering and exiting, but also hindered the development of industry and commerce in the Nanshi area for the past six years. Now it is decided that the French Concession can be taken over as soon as possible, and the iron gate system can be completely abolished, so the prosperity of various industries in the Nanshi area will bring significant development to the economy of the 400,000 citizens of the Nanshi area. Therefore, the 400,000 citizens of the entire Nanshi area are unanimously pledging to be the government's support and strive to promote the smooth development of the work of taking over the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Mr. Sheng You Inspires Humanitarian Spirit, Donates 100,000 Yuan Alone to Support This Newspaper's Scholarship Movement, Creating a Record for Individual Donations in the Past</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Sheng You yesterday. He was deeply moved by this newspaper's repeated appeals for poor students and the limited amount of scholarships and the crowded application situation. He generously donated 100,000 yuan. Mr. Sheng saw righteousness and acted bravely, taking it upon himself to help outstanding young people with their studies, which is admirable. This newspaper has been organizing scholarships for five sessions, and we are grateful for the generous donations from all walks of life. Mr. Sheng's solo donation of a huge amount is the highest individual donation to this newspaper's scholarship fund. His generosity is very great, and his inspiration of human sympathy and mutual assistance will be very profound. The colleagues are deeply worried about the high tuition fees this year, the large number of applications, and the insufficient amount of scholarships to be allocated. Now that we have Mr. Sheng's advocacy and support, we are confident that people from all walks of life will follow suit enthusiastically. This year's scholarship movement will surely be perfectly completed thanks to Mr. Sheng's righteous act. Mr. Sheng's letter said: "Dear Sirs, I have repeatedly read your newspaper's editorials and news about scholarships, enthusiastically advocating and benefiting the poor, which is admirable. Especially this year, there are many people seeking help, and the estimated funding is far from enough. I am deeply moved by your sincere appeal. Young students are the backbone of the country and society in the future. If we want them to be practical and useful in the future, we must start laying the foundation today. Moreover, there are many children with good aptitude and intelligence. Because of poverty, they drop out of school, which leads to their being buried. This is painful for the students themselves and their parents, and it is an even greater loss for the country and society. Now your newspaper is advocating the scholarship movement. In addition to expressing my approval, I would like to attach a check dated July 13 for 100,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. Please check and receive it. Sincerely yours, Sheng You Bai Qi, July 13."</p>

<h3>Housing Disputes Apply to Wartime Leasing Law, Authorities Order Compliance</h3>

<h3>This Newspaper Hosts a Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting for the Relief of North China, A Record of Continued Donations, Small Calligraphers and Painters Will Continue to Write for Guests Starting Tomorrow, Continued Receipt of珍品 for Participation in Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the opening of the calligraphy and painting exhibition. Despite the heat and heavy rain, visitors continued to come in an endless stream, and they enthusiastically made purchases, which shows that there are many people who are kind-hearted and do good deeds. Today, we are rearranging the exhibition again, displaying the calligraphy and painting separately, and adding精品 to fill the gaps. Among the displayed calligraphy and paintings, the "Hundred Longevity Characters" calligraphy work by the young calligrapher Qian Yilong, with its strong and vigorous strokes, seems extraordinary. Therefore, it was purchased by Mr. Shen Simin on the first day. Starting tomorrow, we will invite young painters Chen Yunlu and Chen Honglu, and young calligrapher Fang Wen, to write for guests. We welcome primary school students to visit and gather together, which is a rare opportunity. In addition, Mr. Pan Sansheng donated a 5-carat diamond ring, priced at 160,000 yuan; a true copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, priced at 50,000 yuan; jade five-dragon pendants and精玉 bottles, each priced at 20,000 yuan; a熙磁盆金套, priced at 4,000 yuan; jade knives, ancient mud, and large Qingtian stones with chicken blood stone, etc., are all extremely valuable.</p>

<h3>Director of Education Lin Encourages Students to Be Frugal</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Jiongan, Director of the Bureau of Education of this city, gave a speech to encourage young students to practice frugality, saying, "Frugality is an inherent virtue of China, but since the introduction of European customs into the East, it has gradually been abandoned by social figures. Since Mr. Zhang Yongting, a pioneer in the educational circles of this city, initiated the movement to promote frugality last year, although it has not been long, this atmosphere has spread throughout the country, which shows that the movement to promote frugality is indeed in urgent need under the current situation. People have the same heart, and hearts have the same principles. In recent years, wars have continued, disasters have been frequent, and the people's poverty has reached its extreme. The country is currently in turmoil, and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed. Seeing that most of the people in Shanghai are still living a flowery and drunken life in a dream, it is very sad to say it. In the future, I hope that everyone will practice simplicity, which is equivalent to saving the country. I hope that students from all schools will practice it in a down-to-earth manner to overcome the difficulties of the war."</p>
<h3>Levy Table Tax to Supplement Education Funds, Restaurants and Noodle Shops That Do Not Sell Dishes Are Exempt</h3>

<p>In accordance with the amended regulations on private schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau has long stipulated that private schools that have not been approved by the competent educational administrative authority shall not conduct enrollment and open classes. It has been found that there have been private primary and secondary schools in the past that have failed to submit an application for approval to the Bureau before opening, and have enrolled students and started classes without authorization, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the Bureau has stipulated that all newly established private primary and secondary schools must submit an application to the Bureau for approval before opening, starting from the 15th of this month. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be shut down.</p>

<h3>Teacher Dies from Assault: Verdict in the Su Yizhi Case: Liu Wangshi Sentenced to Eight Years Imprisonment and Ordered to Pay 50,000 Yuan for Funeral Expenses</h3>
<p>The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who died from injuries sustained after being beaten by Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, has been repeatedly heard in the First Special District Court. After detailed investigation, the final judgment was announced yesterday morning by Judge Du Fuyao in the Second Criminal Court. The full text of the judgment reads: "Liu Wangshi is sentenced to eight years imprisonment for causing death by continuous assault." In addition, in the civil suit, "Liu Wangshi shall compensate Su Fengying 30,000 yuan in new legal tender for the funeral expenses of her sister Su Yizhi, and 20,000 yuan as consolation money to Su Yizhi's grandmother, Su Lushi, totaling 50,000 yuan." After the sentence was pronounced, Judge Du declared to the defendant: "The investigation of this case shows that you slapped Su Yizhi twice, as testified by witnesses, and according to the coroner's report, the deceased died from cerebral hemorrhage caused by the two blows to the head, without any doubt. The deceased was a female teacher, and both you and the defendant are women. There was no prior feud between you. It was only because your son did not hand in his homework and was spanked by the teacher that you went to confront her. If this trend continues, it will greatly hinder the future of education. However, you did not expect that this would lead to death so quickly, and considering you are a woman, the sentence is reduced to eight years imprisonment. If you do not agree with this judgment, you can appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days of receiving the judgment."</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Stipulate Vehicles Must Turn on Lights at Night</h3>

Those without certificates will be inoculated on the spot. At the same time, the epidemic prevention certificates for April have already been invalidated. In addition to being collected and torn up on the spot, inoculations are also required to maintain public health during the summer months.</p>
<h3>Citizens Allowed to Report Self-Serving and Corrupt Jia Chiefs: Municipal Baojia Council Strictly Rectifies</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the Baojia system in the city, the Baojia chiefs in each district have failed to abide by their duties, which has not only disturbed the local citizens but has also undermined the entire Baojia system. In order to effectively rectify this situation, the Municipal Baojia Committee has issued orders to the Baojia offices in each district, severely reprimanding them. While many Baojia chiefs have reformed and improved their conduct, some Baojia chiefs are still outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, which is regrettable. In order to eliminate long-standing malpractices, the Baojia Committee has allowed citizens in each district to report self-serving and corrupt Baojia chiefs so that they can be severely investigated and rectified.</p>

<p>(64) Mr. Zhou Dingyu (Kangqi Real Estate Company) came forward to express his willingness to participate, saying: "The 'Convention' alone cannot reach the entire society, and the effect is still insufficient. It is best to invite the managers of major restaurants and the chairmen and standing committee members of the industry associations of the wine and food industry to hold a symposium with those who participate in the convention to formulate several types of 'economical dishes' with uniform prices to popularize them in society."</p>
<p>(65) Lin Zhishou, Gu Siping, Zhu Biao, and Tang Xiongliang, colleagues of the Model Joint Wedding Office, jointly wrote a letter stating that they are willing to abide by the convention, with each person spending no more than 25 yuan per table, and that any banquets will not serve shark fin or drink excessive amounts of alcohol.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Radio Supervision Office</h3>
<p>The Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy issued a notice and made a statement on December 18 last year, stating that all radios listed as prohibited from use must be modified or purchased by the authorities. The Radio Supervision Office has now issued a notice as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the notice and statement issued by the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy on December 18, Showa 17 (1942), those who have applied to the Shanghai District Prohibited Radio Permit Committee for permission to use, possess, and transfer "Type A" prohibited radios (referring to those with seven or more tubes) and are now found to be unable to be approved will be purchased by the Japanese military. Those who possess the above radios must provide them according to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Dates: July 19, 20, and 21, 1943, for a total of three days, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day.</p>
<p>(2) Location: Purchasing Office, Broadcasting Building, 133 Sichuan Road (Telephone 11622).</p>
<p>(3) Items to Bring: A. Previous Radio Registration Certificate (i.e., the registration certificate from the patrol room or police station). B. Registration Certificate for "Type A" Prohibited Radio (if not yet registered or lost, it should be re-registered immediately, and a seal must be brought). C. Radio.</p>
<p>(2) At the same time, those who have applied for permission to use, possess, and transfer "Type B" prohibited radios (those that can receive frequencies outside the 550-1500 frequency range) and "Type C" prohibited radios (those with internal devices that can be modified for broadcasting or communication at any time). If the examination deems them unapprovable, they must send the radio to the designated modification office for modification before the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>If you do not know the address of the designated modification office, you can inquire at the following telephone numbers: (1) Supervision Office 19871, (2) Purchasing Office 11613, (3) Zhongyuan Broadcasting Association 40949.</p>
<p>(3) Those who have obtained a "Type A" prohibited radio use, possession, and transfer permit issued by the Shanghai District Prohibited Radio Permit Committee and have already registered with this office must send their registration certificate together with the permit to the purchasing office during the period specified in item 1 for review (the radio does not need to be brought).</p>
<p>(4) Those who violate the above items will be severely punished according to military law.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Economic Morbidity</h3>
<p>The morbidities of China's economy, as far as this reporter knows, are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the lack of investigation and statistics. Taking the supply and demand situation of goods in various places as an example, what is the actual production and sales volume? How much is the surplus in a certain place, and how much is the loss in a certain place? There is a lack of accurate investigation and precise statistics, relying only on hearsay, so rumors follow, leading to endless price increases, which has a great impact on the market. This is the first.</p>
<p>Second, the lack of equalization measures. Price stability is valuable. Extending this to stocks and bonds, which one does not value stability? The prerequisite for stability is to have equalization measures. If the price of goods in a certain place is too high, a sufficient quantity should be transported in to adjust it. If the price of goods in a certain place is too low, the government should purchase an appropriate amount to prevent foreign materials from stopping. This is the second.</p>
<p>Third, the dream of material exchange. Material exchange has been talked about for a long time. However, the materials of Place A and Place B, and Place B and Place C, are stagnant, and the prices are disparate. One side suffers from the lack of an outlet for materials, and the other side suffers from the lack of access to supply. What is the crux of the matter? What methods can be used to break this deadlock? This is the third.</p>
<p>The above three points. It is hoped that the government authorities and economic sages will pay attention to this, in order to seek a way for China's economic world to survive and seek life. This is what we all pray for.</p>
<h3>Domestic Raw Materials Arrive in Shanghai One After Another: Distribution Handled by Various Industry Associations: Factories Increase Production One After Another</h3>
<p>The factories in this city were previously unable to obtain sufficient raw materials, which slightly hindered production, resulting in many factories stopping work or reducing production. It was learned yesterday that various domestic raw materials have been arriving here in a steady stream, and the responsible authorities have fairly distributed them to the respective industry associations, instructing them to distribute them to their members for use as soon as possible in order to restore production as scheduled. The distribution method is mostly based on grading and distribution, determined according to the amount of capital. First, the association determines the quota, and then immediately notifies the members, instructing them to send personnel with their seals to pay the loan and issue certificates. With the certificate, they can go to the designated warehouse to pick up the goods.</p>
<p>Assess Prices and Wholesale to Merchants</p>
<p>Once each industry obtains these raw materials, they must start work and increase production. After the goods are manufactured, they must submit a sample of the goods to the industry association with a document, along with a cost table for the manufactured goods, to be submitted to the evaluation committee for review and evaluation of the standard price limit. It is then sent to the relevant authorities for approval before replying to the approved limit for wholesale to various retailers. However, it is absolutely limited to legitimate merchants. Those who have been punished by the authorities for engaging in illegal transactions or are not members of the association should be refused wholesale to prevent hoarding.</p>
<p>Small Factories Spring Up Like Mushrooms</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from responsible parties in various industries yesterday that recently, due to the difficulty for large factories to collect raw materials, they have all stopped production. However, the demand for goods in the market is high, resulting in a shortage of supply. Those who are determined to produce goods do not hesitate to collect funds to manufacture goods on a small scale. To date, the development of various small-scale industries is like bamboo shoots after rain, including knitting factories, box factories, dyeing factories, canning factories, textile factories, toothbrush factories, leather factories, and others. Although their products are quite inferior, they are still able to meet the needs of the middle class because of their low cost and low price.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Investigates and Prohibits Industry Associations from Charging Special Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has received confidential reports that officials of various industry associations often charge special fees to member merchants, which is very wrong. The association membership fees are all implemented in accordance with laws and regulations and must be submitted to the bureau for approval before they can be collected. The additional special fee is obviously a clever name, which violates laws and regulations. Therefore, it has ordered all industry associations to prohibit this and sent personnel to investigate. If there is still a charge for the above-mentioned illegal special fee, they will be severely punished once it is verified.</p>
<h3>Various Associations Help the Authorities to Suppress Price</h3>
<p>The various industry associations in this port have gradually entered the right track after being reorganized recently. It is learned that the associations have recently formulated the following key points of the important measures to be implemented to assist the authorities in suppressing prices: (1) Order members to submit the quantity of goods in stock; (2) Investigate the hoarding of goods by members; (3) Members must report the status of sales on a regular basis; (4) Members shall not change the price limits approved by the authorities and announced by the association; (5) Members shall not violate the various measures announced and implemented by the association, otherwise they will be ordered to withdraw.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market fluctuated greatly, with a sharp rise and fall. The hearts of those who were determined were already wavering. The number of rising stocks increased. Those sellers who were eager to realize profits were eager to sell. The Xin Xin Department Store was able to stand firm. The National Goods (stock) rose. Yong'an immediately fell after seeing a new high price, and the squeeze up was the least. The underwear stocks rose, and Jinglun and Jinghua followed suit, rising high with little pullback. The rise of Yong'an Textile decreased day by day. Xinhuo, Rongfeng, and Xinfeng all rose to near the major mark. Tongji also made a high price. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Zhunshang Electric rose alone and did not fall back. The Greater China Match Company still closed at the highest price. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose first, then fell slightly. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinyi rose the most strongly. Zhongfa and Xinya continued to rise. Among the cultural industries, the purchase prices of Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company were only seen to be rising. New real estate companies emerged one after another. Jiuan Industrial's transaction was slightly firmer in the market. Xinya Construction and Tongyi Trust were very stable. Kangyuan Canning stood out by passing the 100-mark.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the Shanghai silversmith industry, Daxin Tonghang jewelry gold, was still sold at the price limit at the front desk per tael. There was no change in the handling fee, and there were a few transactions outside the industry. At noon, it slightly lowered, but it was only a small correction after a big rise. Trading was not active, and the price of silver outside the industry again exited a barrier.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate: The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate is still two-tenths of a cent, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Business Consolidation Committee Levies Transaction Fees: Effective from July 15th</h3>
<p>The Business Consolidation Committee handles the approval of in/out of controlled materials and the approval of transfers, and transaction fees will be levied. It is heard that it has been stipulated: (1) For all controlled materials moved into or out of the Shanghai area, and moved out or out of Shanghai, (2) Controlled materials transferred from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Nanjing Special Municipality, to other regions in the country, 1% of the value will be levied as the committee's transaction fee, effective from July 15th.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Japanese Economic Delegation's Visit to China</h3>
<p>As for the detailed content, it is not appropriate to make additional speculations, but the answers of Chairman Ogura to news reporters, the speech of Chairman Tang of the Business Consolidation Committee at the welcome of the delegation, and the remarks of Mr. Akashi Teruo are all worthy of our attention. When Chairman Ogura answered the question from the news reporter, he said: The central task of completing the Greater East Asia War. No matter from which side, it is nothing more than handling China-Japan relations, especially handling economic relations. Only after this issue is completely handled successfully can there be the possibility of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The new economic policy also takes this as a starting point. If the new economic policy can be promoted smoothly, then it can be expected that China's industry will develop autonomously, thereby enhancing the hope of increasing production. In this kind of cooperation, Japan's capital or technology can cooperate with China's national capital and talents, starting from resources and taking the step of increasing production, but the method and business attitude still need to be fully reviewed by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>According to the informal opinion expressed by Mr. Akashi Teruo: The essence of the new economic policy lies in protecting and nurturing China's national capital. National capital provides a new field of activity. We are prepared to remove all obstacles to this matter in order to implement financial cooperation.</p>
<p>Chairman Tang's view on China's economic problems is as follows: China-Japan economic cooperation is the established policy of the two governments. The specific problem is the mutual understanding and trust between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. At the same time, it also lies in establishing a sound economic foundation for China. Only in this way can it be enough to promote the autonomous development of China's economy and enhance production. However, when implementing this measure, there must be a minimum guarantee for the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>During this visit, the delegation and Chinese economic figures frankly exchanged opinions on how to concretize the principles of the new policy. A certain Chinese economic figure believed that during this meeting between the Chinese and Japanese economic circles, he hoped that the Japanese economic figures would frankly express their opinions in the future in dealing with economic problems. These few words show how eager the Chinese economic circles are for the delegation's visit to China. (Yunpeng: Translated from the July 12th Chiku Shinpo) (The End)</p>

<h3>Confidence and Stubbornness</h3>
<p>— Ji Weiyi</p>
<p>Some people say: "Confidence is the key to a successful career; therefore, people with strong confidence are often the successful people of the future." This statement is accurate from a positive perspective; but if we look at it from the opposite perspective, we can hear flaws. Because people with strong "confidence" are often inherently "stubborn", they often refuse to humbly accept the advice of others; they refuse to calmly understand the criticisms of others; they see themselves as being as lofty as the sky... Such people are very difficult to make friends with and gain the help of others. On the contrary, they will suffer all kinds of unnecessary setbacks, and thus be eliminated, suffering the unfortunate consequences themselves.</p>
<p>However, let's get back to the point. The "stubborn" spirit of never giving up on a career is valuable. It is worthy of our praise. When carrying out a task, we must persevere stubbornly to achieve extraordinary achievements. We must stubbornly despise the ridicule of others, we must stubbornly overcome difficulties and hardships and use a dauntless spirit to obtain the meaningful "life" we hope for.</p>
<p>Usually, we may as well be more flexible and absorb the strengths of others. But in times of crisis, we must not be afraid of ridicule, and stubbornly unleash our greatest strength.</p>
<h3>Review of "Love Threads on the Opera Gown"</h3>
<p>— Mu Hua</p>
<p>The script of "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is an adaptation of "Man Jiang Hong". The plot development is that a popular opera singer in Nanjing falls in love with a poor calligrapher. Misunderstandings arise, leading the two to go to extremes. Later, both sides finally understand, one solves the marriage siege for her, and the other risks his life to save her. Thus, there is a happy reunion on Qingliang Mountain, ending the whole story. In terms of the viewpoint of the entire script, or the performance of each plot, it cannot be denied that it still carries some "Mandarin Duck Butterfly" colors.</p>
<p>However, let's get back to the point. If we compare it to the several films directed by Sun Jing in the past, then "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is still considered an improvement among these many films. The handling of the entire film did not disappoint, although there are still many places for discussion about the director's techniques. For example, Tong Zhiling repeatedly went back and forth at the foot of Qingliang Mountain, several times, but the same shot was used to handle it, which made people feel uninteresting and lifeless. It was almost suspected that one shot was washed several times, creating a dullness.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, Mei Xi's performance was the most skilled and sophisticated. The emotions of trouble and grief when losing love, as well as the appearance of openly claiming to be Tong Zhiling's husband, were performed just right. Tong Zhiling's dialogue and singing, the tone is too balanced, lacking emotional expression. Only a few swift and steady shots are quite colorful, and the rest, such as Lu Yukun, are still adequate.</p>
<p>Like the elopement in "Yin Xian Zhu", "Love Threads on the Opera Gown" is dyed with a strong Peking Opera color.</p>
<h3>Reading Notes at Lang Jingshan's Tongyun Study</h3>
<p>— Liang Yu</p>
<p>Zheng Yunshan and his wife will hold an exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor starting on the 17th of this month. Jingshan is a famous photographer, and he has a wealth of experience in visiting famous mountains and rivers. Now he continues his passion, capturing the spirit of the peaks, which makes them feel fresh and free from vulgarity. Every mountain and every river is well-positioned, and the scenery and emotions blend together. This is because he has learned a lot from photography. His ink landscape paintings are elegant and pleasant, and his brushstrokes are close to Yunlin and Dachi, the former being elegant and moist and the latter being dry and astringent, each with its own merits, which shows that he has studied them deeply. Occasionally, he paints flowers and birds with delicate brushstrokes, and it is difficult to capture the spirit of the Song and Yuan dynasties. His wife, Ms. Peizhi, paints small portraits of people with clothing folds and facial features that have the style of the Jin and Tang dynasties. Her image of the Supreme Sage Confucius is dignified and solemn, which makes people feel respectful. The facial contours are good, and the clothing folds show strength. Mr. Wu Hufan's inscriptions add the finishing touch. The daughter, Yuxian, is also skilled in painting, and she has recently studied landscape painting with Qian Shu'ai. Her brushstrokes are ancestral and full of northern style, which is different from your aunt's style. Moreover, she is gifted with a keen ear, and she can skillfully create nature with the landscape blueprints taken by her father. It is clear that the family's elegance and reputation will be recognized in the art world.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Staff Officer Zhang thought to himself, this person is quite dim-witted; they won't move unless pushed. If I hadn't put on a brave face and confronted them head-on, tonight's matter would never have been settled so cheaply. He only cared about getting the money, regardless of the bloody cost to others. While thinking this, he followed Commander ×'s urging out the door, turning back stealthily towards Li, the town leader's, room. Li and Lu were worried that tonight's matter would not be easily resolved. Staff Officer Zhang had been gone for a long time and hadn't returned, which always meant a bad outcome was likely. They were anxious when they suddenly glimpsed a dark shadow flitting towards them from the corner. The shadowy figure's expression was dim, but seemed to show a hint of success. Half of the weight on their minds lifted, and they stepped forward to greet him.</p>
<p>"Staff Officer Zhang, thank you for your hard work! Did the commander agree?" Town Leader Li asked in a low voice. Staff Officer Zhang gave a slight smile, not answering immediately. He stood his ground, turned back to look at Ah Kun, who was standing dejectedly in the corner, and said slowly:</p>
<p>"It's alright! He finally agreed! But it was very close!"</p>
<p>Town Leader Li didn't quite understand at first, but upon hearing the words "finally agreed," half of the weight on his mind lifted again. He then asked:</p>
<p>"What was it like? Were there any other conditions? What did the commander say?"</p>
<p>"There were many, I'll tell you in detail another day! Tonight, let's first conclude this matter. It's already late, and further delay might lead to changes. Let's go to the room over here to talk!" Staff Officer Zhang said, leading Li and Lu into another room. There were two beds, a table, and several wooden benches here. It was Staff Officer Zhang's bedroom. The three of them sat around the table. Zhang spoke first:</p>
<p>"Let's not waste time with idle chatter. Let's be honest. The commander has agreed to let me handle everything. I understand both of your difficulties, and indeed, Ah Kun is very poor. However, the commander needs to save face. Even with what Town Leader Li mentioned just now, taking it all to him, there will be costs for compensating the brothers outside, so please find a way to come up with a little more. That way, you can leave tonight. What do you think, Town Leader Li?"</p>
<p>"Thank you for Staff Officer Zhang's help, here..." Li, relieved of his doubts, said as he reached into his pocket for banknotes, "A total of eight hundred yuan. We have also prepared a reward for the brothers. Please accept it, Staff Officer Zhang! Six hundred yuan as a 'tribute' to the commander, and the remaining two hundred yuan for the brothers to buy cigarettes. Is that enough? Furthermore, we will naturally reward Staff Officer Zhang handsomely for his help tomorrow... Ha! Ha!" Town Leader Li said, a smile on his face. Staff Officer Zhang accepted the banknotes, stood up, and said:</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment, I'll be right back." He went out and returned to the room shortly after, his face full of smiles, saying:</p>
<p>"You can go back now! Sit here for a moment while I call Ah Kun over. We'll go together! (10)"</p>
