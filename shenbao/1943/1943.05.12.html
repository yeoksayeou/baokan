<h3 id="c1">加強警察制度 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我國警察制度的建立，已有數十年的歷史。現在各省市各縣區也都有警察設置。對於警察敎育方面，中央及地方都有警官學校以及臨時訓練班等。內政部以警政列爲主要內政設施。凡此種種，過去政府對於警察制度的推行，也曾相當努力。然而，我們一加檢討其實質，則縣區地方警察。大半是保民不足，蠹民有餘，爲土豪劣紳張其勢燄，與奸胥猾吏同被側目；而都市警察，雖稍稍注意於素質與訓練，但因待遇微薄，精神不振，大多數不能盡職，人民對之觀感，因亦無法提高。「自重者，人恒重之；自愛者，人必愛之。」警察不能自重自愛，人民自亦不能重之愛之，精神之間，形成仇視與對立之狀態。所以，警政之理想，警察之使命，以與今日之事實相衡，誠是背道而馳，言之喟然。</p>
<p>然而我們並不能以警政不良之責任，完全諉之於警察，或少數主管警政人員肩上。我們知道整個警察制度與警察政策，是取決於主管機關者；同時，政府負有督導之責任。如果政府根本不重視警政，那末，警政的成效與前途，也必然黯淡無光了。</p>
<p>進一步說，我們認爲目前和平區域以內，警察制度的加强，較之擴充軍隊與特務工作，實允重要，必須從速增强警察制度的再建立。謹就所見，申論如次：</p>
<p>軍隊之責，爲捍衛地方；特務工作，爲偵察奸宄；而警察之責任，除保衛治安，警奸察宄，可局部代任軍隊與特工職務以外，並有維持社會風化，兼作人民師保之更大任務。蓋警察之施敎，不擇地，不擇時，亦不擇人，勸勤，勸勇，勸仁，敎秩序，敎紀律，敎互助，示人民以應趨應勉與應避應戒之途，乃至普及法令智識於人民，推行良好習慣於社會，應人民之詢問，而爲之指示，皆爲警察之所有事。概括言之，軍隊與特工所做之事，警察可以兼做，而警察所做之事，則爲軍隊與特工所不能兼做。此其一。</p>
<p>目前政府對內工作，最重要者，爲促成全面和平的實現，必先求和平區內人民對於和平信念的堅定，從散漫的心理趨於團結，凌亂的社會秩序趨於整齊，而終極目的爲政府與人民打成一片，利害相同，痛癢相關。此在公務人員中，行政官吏，不過執行政令，與民衆直接接觸之機會不多。惟有警察，乃爲實際接近民衆，也是隨時隨地與民衆接觸者。所以，眞正求得政府與人民打成一片，促成這一工作的最適任者，就是警察。因此，警察的使命與任務，非常重要而艱巨，較之軍隊與特工，實有過之，無不及，此其二。</p>
<p>我們既已瞭解警察制度的强化，較之擴軍與特工爲尤要尤急。於此，我們即可看出過去警政之所以失敗的癥結，就在側重於軍隊與特工方面，而忽略了警政。所以，盼望政府嚴切注意警政的重要，而急其所急，從速加强警察制度。我們願再貢獻管見數點：</p>
<p>（一）提高警察待遇，使之能維持最低限度之生活，而安心服務。我們承認一部分詐欺取財，賄賂舞弊的勾當，產生於不堪生活的一念之差者，未始全無，於法固不可恕，於情不免可憐。我們曾屢屢聽到警察直口承認：</p>
<p>「靠了些微薪餉，自己都養不活，不要說仰事俯蓄，不撈外快，難道餓死不成」的話，我們當重視這個現實，請求政府把警察薪餉提高，然後才可責以應盡的任務。</p>
<p>（二）提高警察敎育。警察既兼爲人民師保，施敎之範圍至廣，故其自身更應具備正確與豐富之智識，始克勝任。至於品性之培養，技能之博習，均爲必有之訓練。</p>
<p>（三）鍛鍊健全體格，同爲重要之事。精神寄於體魄，如無嚴格鍛鍊，以致精神萎靡頹弱，不但引起民衆之不尊視，如遇有緊急變故，即不堪勝任緊張工作。警察原以「不眠不休」爲格言，如無特別健全的體格，決不能遂行其職務。</p>
<p>（四）政府確定警政經費，提高警員薪餉，明定警員職權，重視警員地位，然後，學識優長，有志服務之士，也必樂於投身警界，充實警政人事。</p>
<p>（五）日本辦理警政成績，爲世界著稱，一切有關規章辦法，足供參考借鏡者必多，應由政府派遣警務人員，實地考察研究，以資改進。同時，聘請有經驗有學識之專家，來華協助推行警政，以期盡善。</p>
<p>警政之加强，既較軍隊與特工之加强爲尤急，而特工之進行，允足創弱警政之機能，所以盼望政府，應以特工之經費與人才，歸併於警政，而融合於整個警察政策之中。我們相信行之以嚴，不但優良警政之基礎，得以確立；而於政府與人民打成一片之工作，必有大效。願有關當局，急起圖之。</p>

<p>馬尼刺十一日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相十一日八時三十分在馬尼刺飯店與村田顧問懇談一小時時後，繼於九時四十分起，與菲島戈爾加斯行政長官以下行政府各部長官舉行會談，的歷一小時半。</p>
<p>馬尼剌十一日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相十日抵此間後，即於下午二時訪問軍司令部，聽取軍政監及軍政監部各部長對軍政各方面情形之報吿。當晚七時於馬尼刺飯店出席菲島方面陸軍最高指揮官之招待宴。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十一日中央社電　日菲島方面陸軍最高指揮官，昨特假馬尼刺飯店宴請靑木大東亞相，菲島行政長官伐爾加期等日菲要人，被邀請作陪。靑木大東亞相即席演講，於盛讚菲島官民協助日本建設大東亞共榮圈之努力後，並謂：東條首相乃正義之人，且爲新時代之政治家，故言出必行，菲島之獨立條件即將整備，故東條首相之的言，不久亦將見諸實現。今後之唯一問題，常爲全菲島人爲獲得其自由而繼作進一步之努力云云。繼之日菲島軍政監亦謂：菲島決無不能獲得獨立之理，菲島人現正全面協力日本，前此菲島殆無一名獨立志士，如里薩爾者，今則已有千八百萬人之里薩爾爲新菲島之建設而努力。</p>
<p>馬尼拉十一日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相，近正於南方往來視察，十一日下午六時特在此間招待記者團，暢談其旅行南方之印象，大意謂：余此次來南方各地視察，感覺各地均能一致與日本協力，爲完遂作戰，而作莫大努力，此爲南方各地當局指導得宜及東亞民族互相協力有以致之。余目睹各地經濟建設多富有創造性，並足見其頗費苦心，此實深可欣慰，而應表示敬佩者。至各地原住民之協力狀况，並未因國情與民族之相異，而在其協力方法上所有不同。南方各地農業雖極發達，工業則頗感落後，但巳能分別利用其特徵勞力發抓總力，如緬甸深感其處身前綫之重要，故當地民衆均充滿鬥志，而在戰禍中奮起。爪哇之印度納西亞人，則於加平之空氣中，協助日方施策，此實深堪爲吾人所銘感者。菲島向受美國特質文明之影響，而爲特殊環境所支配，致產業組織亦帶有特殊色彩，但伐爾加斯行政長官等及有識之士，均能理解東亞共榮圈之意義，致力建設新菲島，此在政治，經濟等方面最爲顯然。今日大東亞十億民族業已團結一致，互相協力，再以日本科學技術及東亞無藏物質與人力等之要素作有機的結合，而形成惟一之經濟圈，其力量之如何偉大，余亦無法估計。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日軍在太行山脈　展開第二期作戰　湘省日軍獲偉大戰果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>太原十日中央社電　日軍此次在太行山脈展開之第二期作戰，其意義第一爲澈底剿共，蓋前當國府參戰，日本轉換對中國政策時，共軍曾大事宣傳謂，日軍將由中國撤退，此與事實不符，良以日軍於擊滅渝軍第廿四集團軍後，即在太行山實行第二期作戰，重創共軍，拯救該地民衆，使其明瞭中國巳有飛躍之發展。自該决作戰以來，渝方將領巳有多人參加和運，擁護國府，因此該地一般民衆，對共黨之黑暗政治已深抱懷疑。第二爲中國剿共軍之充分發揮實力，該軍自本年六月改編以來，卽曾猛烈訓練，頃參加此次作戰，攻入涉縣北方，充分發揮其實力，並曾數度建立武勳，重創共軍。第三爲共軍設施之悉被擊毀，蓋共軍在晋冀豫邊區設有各種工廠，以附近所產物資製造武器彈藥，以謀抗日戰力之自給自足，並以其所餘武器，接濟冀西方面，但經日軍此次猛攻後，其軍事政治經濟上各種設施，均全吿覆滅，華北共軍，於冀西地帶，旣被擊潰，今又蒙重創，此後殆將無力再起。</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　據湖南前綫來電，我國保安隊，爲拯救呻吟於渝政權苛政下之民衆，業已參加日軍作戰，一路向湖南之原野進舉。據該保安隊前曾在某地於日軍指導下勇猛作戰，軍紀嚴明，深得民衆之信賴，湖南作戰展開後一，彼等自某隊長以下，均奮勇出動，於槍林彈雨中於日軍生死相共，擔任戒備基地之重務，並宣傳佔領區之民衆，且與日軍分擔辛苦，勇猛作戰，士氣極爲旺盛。</p>

<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德軍事專門家頃就東錢之發展表明見解稱，東部戰綫之泥濘期已完全終了，大規模作戰已可能，德蘇兩軍今後於何時何地再開始大攻勢一事，固不能輕下斷語，而德蘇兩軍現均準備展開大規模攻勢，則至爲明顯，即一，蘇聯徹底動員男子，積極擴充軍需工業，以塡補冬季戰所受之人物損失一事，大體已獲成功，惟此僅係量的方面，兵士之質的方面，則較開始冬季反攻之時遠爲低劣。一，蘇軍於兵器整備方面，似已俟復前此之强力，如庫班橋頭堡一役，其重兵器即大見增强。關於空軍觀諸連日擊落蘇機之數止，可知其本質毫未改良，在量的增强則可注意。一般均謂蘇軍於　班地區之外，特專取守勢者，余意非是，蓋丁莫生柯軍雖於一九四二年春在卡科夫開始攻勢歸於失敗，今年似專待德軍進攻，然其神經過分緊張之結果，或反將開始進攻，此點當可想像，惟其果有此行動，則不過徒爲準備充足之德軍好餌。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　據東綫消息，庫班河口地區之蘇軍，十日復以新銳戰車部隊在諾佛羅西斯克港東北九哩某地展開攻勢，當與迎擊之德羅聯軍展開激戰，因該地帶爲山岳地帶，故蘇軍作戰受相當阻碍，同時又因德軍奇襲部隊行動迅速自側面加以攻擊，致蘇軍犧牲甚大。又蘇軍因　曼半島戰局已限於膠着狀態，乃以機械化步兵分乘陸用舟艇　三十艘，企圖於該半島西北方登陸，然經德空軍發現後，似已全部將其擊沉。同時最近東綫全城空戰益趨熾烈，掌握制空權之德空軍，連日收獲極大戰果，據德軍當局發表，德軍於十日擊落蘇機四十一架，自五月二日迄今八日之一週間，總計擊落蘇機四百七十四架，德機損失三十六架。</p>

<p>出席者</p>
<p>陳公博</p>
<p>大川周明</p>
<p>橘樸</p>
<p>松本重治</p>
<p>山本實彥</p>
<p>山本：　時間很侷促，現在　請大川先生……。</p>
<p>大川：　聽了陳先生一番　　之後，心裏的　慮，差不多都消失了。所謂掛慮，那就是因爲找今年還沒有到過上海，不知道上海實際的情形如何。像您所知道的，央年年底，上海的食米配給所，還只有九家，剛纔聽您所說，現在中國的物資已經豐富起來了，所以配給所一定也跟着增多了吧。您說物價已經便宜了，所以上海的物價也　也跟着便宜了。到了這樣的日子，若不急速解救民衆的生活痛苦，那末時局是無從收拾的吧。</p>
<p>必須把現在的鄉土社會，作爲中國國家的支柱，這話，我和橘君的意見相同，不過在現在看來，自從戰爭開始以來，在這過去的七年之間，民族的移動，是非常激化的。依我想，恐怕巳經有了四千萬的人民，離開了家鄉，暫時的或水久的遷居於他鄉了吧。因此，地方上的長老，巳喪失其在各自鄉土的支配權，他們也有些遷居　上海　近，不想回到家鄉去。於是一班　非作惡之人，起而佔其勢力，破壞舊社會。這種情形，若不速謀挽救之道，則中國社會全體，就難免從此崩潰。所以我想最好增加一些米的配給，一勺也好，二勺也好。沒有油，正在感到爲難，最好也多給一點廉價的油。要不如此，是不行的，而且是不得不迷謀解決的。我很担心在那計畫沒有實現之間，會不會發生什麽混亂？聽您的話旣然沒有那樣担心的必要，那是再好沒有了。</p>
<p>陳：　大川先生對於我國的狀態，荷蒙衷心掛慮，實在感激之至。現在關於這個問題，我來作一個簡單的說明吧。</p>
<p>在昨天大東亞大臣的招待席上，也有過這樣的話。我曾說　：縱如何貧乏，其他的物資，並不那樣不便，都有辦法，而且對於大東亞戰爭，有着有利的餘裕。不過只有食米一項，總沒有辦法，現在說明於下：</p>
<p>我關於米的問題，曾經加以硏究過。中國的洋米輸人，最先是在同治六年，那時的洋米，是從西貢，緬甸輸入爲主。到了民國，拿事變前五年問的實業部平均統計來看，可知中國在一年內。有一千六百萬石洋米的輸入。其中百分之八十，是輸入廣東，廣西一帶的，其餘百分之二十，即三百二十萬石，則輸入上海，長江一帶，那是歷年平均的統計，由此可知一年內輸入中國的洋米，實達相當的鉅額。事變後，農村破壞，田園荒蕪，對於米的生產，簡直是一個極大的破壞。於是，在國內固不用說，現在米的需要，愈益吿急：更且那非有一千六百萬石之輸入不可的洋米—只從上海，長江一帶來說，也非有三百廿萬石之輸入不可的洋米，已沒有船舶運進來了，所以這個數目，又非自己來負担不可。而且米的需要，現在又增加起來，因此便陷於非常困窮的狀態。由於這個緣故，現在一方面乃力謀增加生產，一方面則必須設法從外面輸入食米。我以爲要從外面輸入食米，那是必須恢復交通，仰賴貴國援助，利用船舶或其他，俾能像從前一樣，把外米源源輸入國內。向外國購買食米，原是淸朝又來的事，決不是於今爲始的，我希望應先努力恢復從前購辦外米的情形。</p>
<p>我在民國二十一年至二十四年之間，曾任實業部長。　時我所努力的，是棉花和稻麥的增產。其中關於棉花的增產，曾得到非常良好的成績，在我就任　年的民國二十一年，一年的收獲，尙只六十萬担，但到了民國二十四年，在我離任的時候，已增至一千二百萬担。又在民國二十五年，增至一千五百萬担，所以只要努力硏究，總會漸漸增進的。不過一到事變發生，這個計畫完全停止，工作也被破壞了，至於米或麥的糧食問題，我也同樣作了種子的改良和其他的努力，例如的定某地方的農民過來，借給田地，在那裏試行米穀的改良，把農民收獲的米穀，再來栽種，這樣地在四，五年之間，施行着種子的改良。那事情一直繼續到事變爲止，而開始改良，則在民國二十一年</p>
<p>又關於人口的移動。當時人民顚沛流離，情形非常悽慘，然而一考其移動的路綫，則分三條，一條向長江上流，一條向上海租界流入，一條則逃往香港。到了最近，已經在漸漸回來了。那班回來的人民，差不多大部分是歸鄉的。</p>
<p>山本：現在　松本先生……。</p>
<p>松本：　時間已不多了，我就來簡單地講一點吧。</p>
<p>趁陳先住蒞臨敝國的機會，我　來講兩件務　陳先生帶回去的我們日本人的情緖。</p>
<p>第一就是日本國民的對於大東亞戰爭的必勝信念。這一定要請陳先生確確實實帶回去的。而且這是現實的事實，沒有說明的必要。</p>
<p>其次是日本國民現在正希望中國國民急速強盛起來。這個情緖，也一定要請陳先生確確實實帶回去的。</p>
<p>道裏來講關於强盛的方法。我以爲所謂總力戰，結局是可分爲武力戰，經濟戰和思想戰三項的。關於武力戰，剛纔陳先生說過，軍官學校的畢業生，成績已經非常優秀，所以我們希望還要它多多發展。</p>
<p>關於經濟，我們相信陳先生也正在以其多年的經騐，考慮着種種有計畫的經濟統制的辦法。尤其是因爲陳先生對於那尙還小能樂觀的狀態，作了非常切實的說明之故，使我們反而覺得非常有把握。</p>
<p>關於生產，中國的人士，從前就有了不適於股份公司啦，諸如此類的種種批評。我以爲股份公司的組織等等，巳經過去，現在非有能够適應新時勢的要求的意識之實業界人士出來小可了。而且非有跳出從　所謂浙江財閥那類人的意識而更加進步的實業人士不可。</p>
<p>其次是關於生產和收買配給。那不用說，是互相有着關係的。然而能够最簡單地生出效果來的，我以爲不外是使收買機構的能率化。又在統制總會一方面，也應該以下部組織的問題爲重要。我以爲在它成功之後，生產一定能够上軌道的。至於配給，我以爲在米的配給上，巳經有着種種的經騐了吧，不渦配給統制，我却以爲像日本的隣保組織那樣的下部組織，實是必要的。這種組織，在日本也是到了第三，四年，好容易才有今日那樣的成績的。中國迄今戶口的調查還沒有完成，所以要實行配給，到底是非常困難的，不過現在像香港等地，也完全在行着米的配給，所以只要去行，也未始不能行得的。除米之外，別　物資，我以爲也可以施行配給。這些，我希望都能徹底做去而敬祝成功。</p>
<p>其次就是思想戰的問題。我們覺得一直到最近爲止，中國人士的政治思想的中心，在於民族的自由獨立，我們以爲中國人士，應更進一步，在現在的狀態之下，速謀大東亞諸民族之强　的結合，張起共同戰綫，以擊滅英美。那樣　意識，實是最重要的。鄙人心裏，老早期望着中國人士食有那樣的意識。這次還都三週年紀念的時候，我聽到汪主席　演講，强調大東亞的大東亞人之意識，於中國的中國人之上，又强調其根本的大東亞的大東國人之意　，拜聆之下，實在覺得非常滿意。</p>
<p>日本的將士現在正在前綫戰着。他們有着「爲陛下而戰」的精神，同時還有着「爲日本而戰」的意識；然而他們也確確實實　着「爲大東亞而戰」的意識。因此，中國的指導者階級，應該不徒然囿於賤價的平等論，或形式的對等論（國際的，平等地位）之類的觀念，必須眞正地視中日爲兄弟而相協力才好。中國民族的獨立自由，並不是最高的目的，還有比這更大的目的—如果那樣地把政治意識提高起來，那就非常好啦。不過要那樣地提高政治意識。則那個　實的問題——即中日間信義的再建設，實是必要的吧。如果中日之間沒有信義，則中國方面決不會從所謂中國的意識，抽出一個更大的所謂大東亞的意識，站在這意識上，而與日本協力的。然而中國的參戰，實可認爲是相信日本的結果，所以日本以此爲契機，實施了新政策，由此，把五年前日本由近衛聲明所的定，及三年前由中日間的日華甚本條約所的定的事，成爲現實地施行的事實；因此道民挨和民族間的信義的再建設，愈益能够遂漸實現。因着這樣情勢的漸漸實現，所以我們希望中國諸君，也來衝破那所謂中國民族的意識之殼，而覺醒於大東亞一民族的意識；希望由着這樣的意識，而急速强盛起來。</p>
<p>這話也許是失禮的，卽我以爲日本是哥哥，中國是弟弟，哥哥弟弟互相携手，立於戰綫上，哥哥期待弟弟有可勝過哥哥那樣的强盛。但是哥哥因爲每日行着決不負於弟弟那樣的勉勵，所以希望弟弟也要以勝過哥哥那橡的勇氣而力圖强盛。這雖是非常俗鄙的話，但我却想把這一點奉陳於陳先生</p>
<p>陳：　時間迫促，只好讓我簡單地說一點感想吧。</p>
<p>剛纔松本先生所說對於中國的種種關切的話，我完全同感。覺得那些話好像都是我心中所要說的話一樣。我雖然沒有和諸位作過徹底的晤談，可是中國，現在正像松本先生所說那樣地努力幹着呢。關於經濟問題，像浙江財閥那樣的做法，誰都知道於中國是不利的，但我却更進一步，還以爲於東亞是不利的。而且不限於浙江財閥，像浙江財閥似的其他團體，於大東亞也是不利的，所以我以爲非把這類的閥，完全除去不可。因爲我覺悟着我們的中國，今日固勿論，將來也要永久分擔大東亞的責任的，所以我才有那樣的主張。</p>
<p>其次，關於米的配給方法，我早已聽到像日本所行的隣保　度　有效果，但　在中國已有所謂戶口，道和日本的隣保制度略略相似，現在正利用這戶口組織而行着配給。中國的人口是沒有弄淸楚的，這不但在今日如此，從唐朝時代已是這樣，那時派遣兵隊到國外，東自朝鮮，西迄西藏，都有兵隊派出去。那些兵隊後來竟變成了傭兵。於是便有種種的兵，從家裏被僱出去，這樣一來，戶口便弄不淸楚了。因爲可以那樣地隨便僱傭出去，所以便不能像日本那樣能够淸淸楚楚知道某一家有某年齡的人。中國的人口原來是那樣狀態的。最近因爲迫於米的配給上的必要，所以趕緊在調査戶口。</p>
<p>又關於思想問題，現在中國已發起着新國民運動了。這個新國民運動，不單是在表面上做着少年團啦，靑年團啦，那類的組織而已，而是決定着三個根本的方針的。</p>
<p>第一就是由個人主義而進入國家總體主義。</p>
<p>第二就是由目由資本主義而進入國家社會主義。</p>
<p>第三就是由狹義的民族主義而進入廣義的國家集團主義。</p>
<p>這第三個方針，正如松本先生所說一樣，不單單在於民國的自由獨立，而是指導着所謂大東亞這個思想的。多蒙種種關切，這些現在都在實行着。像剛纔松本先生所說，日本是先進國，是哥哥，中國是弟弟，這話一點不錯。又哥哥在前綫，拚命奮鬭於外，弟弟在家裏，幹着種種家事於內，這話也完全可以表示縐現在中國和日本的關係。然而做弟弟的對於哥哥出外拚命奮鬭，而自己却只在家裏做着家事，心裏是怎麽也覺得不安樂的。所以希望做哥哥的能够觀察到弟弟的心裏，是有着同到前綫出征，同到外面奮鬭的熱情的。</p>
<p>今天得能和諸位很愉快地披瀝胸襟，傾吐界曲，實在感謝之至。</p>
<p>山本：　費了不少實貴時間，我們應該多多感謝。</p>
<p>陳：　（分別之際）橋先生對於三民主義是很有硏究的　，請到中國來一次决好罷，我很想和您慢慢地晚談一番呢。</p>
<p>橘：　我在去年底曾到貴國去過一次，但還沒有到過上海。（丁譯）—完—</p>

<p>中國的國家資本，比了土著民族資本的歷史與實力更深且大，其發達是極有可能的。要抑制產業資本的活動，那末國家權力與國家資本，絕對有强大的必要，所以汪主席在新運綱領中述及此項問題：</p>
<p>「我　在過去爲什麼不能實行民生主義？這是因爲我們沒有充分助長國家資本的發達，今後我們重視這點，必須使國家資本發達，自然抑制個人資本。」</p>
<p>國家與資本，資本與民生的關係，在汪主席訓示中說得非常明白，現在國府的國家資本，第一，就是中日合辦國策公司的國府資本，這些重要企業，都負有國家資本的性質，日方的資本與國府的國家資本合作經營，實具有重大的意義，其利潤與中國商業資本的五十倍，一百倍的暴利夾比較，顯有極大不同。國策公司的今後處置，就是戰時資本的動向，日本國民，衷心希望於國府者，就是請國府自己來硏究國家資本的活動方針，我們雖然是日本人，不過對於下面的實際情形，也很明瞭：國策公司中的國府資本，主要者爲現　投資，其中尙未展開全面的國家資本活動，然除了國策公司以外還有中央儲備銀行及其他部份的國家資本，但是，欲求强力推進對付生產，物　，囤積等項的政策，獲得政洽力的基礎起見，國府的國家資本，實有再强化的必要，不過此際尙須檢討在中國有一種國家資本與官僚資本的關係，像蔣介石就是依靠所謂浙江財閥，勾結官僚資本乃至軍閥資本，希圖加强軍閥的國家資本來强化其「抗戰一基礎，在國家資本力量薄弱的中國，產生了左右國家權力的官僚資本，官僚資本與土著民挨資本的一部份合成一種派閥，官僚資本藉了與土著民族資本的合作關係，來擴大其本身，土者民族資本也藉了與官僚資本的結合來加强自身，其阻礙國家資本正常發展的事實，在中國歷史上巳經屢見不鮮，中國的不幸，實無冉過於此的了。</p>
<p>與日本分擔大東亞戰爭偉業的國府治下，希望其不再有此種事實存在，更信其不會存在，總之，國家資本的官僚資本化，民族資本的買辦資本化，皆爲新中國的正當發展所不取。（雲鵬：續譯大陸新報）</p>

<p>問：據中央社九日南京電稱，巳派遣第二次澈查團，但其具體內容並未明示，未知担任澈査者，爲何許人，伺月何已派遣。</p>
<p>答：關於第二次澈查團派遣事，本處未有所聞，袁决長於數日前因公來滬，亦未聞有已派遣第二次澈査團之言。</p>
<p>問：第二次澈査之中心，是否由實業部担任。</p>
<p>答：本處並未奉到上項指令，第一次澈査團之大員爲財政部次長，實業部决長，商統會監理官，市府秘書長四要員，此種稱成方法，絕未聞有變更之說。</p>
<p>問：上海市民一致希望再度派造大員澈查，貴處認爲是吾有從速派遣之必要。</p>
<p>答：澈査大員，爲國府所派，本處唯有遵從國府之決定行動，是否有其必要，貴記者可自行考慮。</p>
<p>問：一般人皆謂第一次澈査因派閥政治勢力而影響其繼續進行澈査工作，僅三天即吿結束，相信第二次澈査當有較長之時間，貴處以爲如何。</p>
<p>答：第一次澈査以後，上海各機關尙在繼續調査，主張第二次澈査須長期實行之輿論，已頗明瞭。</p>
<p>問：處理囤積問題，乃重要課題，爲謀便於解決此事計，實業部駐滬辦事處，財政部駐滬辦事處，市政府，工部局，公董局之間有設一共同委員會之必要，未識以爲如何？</p>
<p>答：深感各機關有密切聯絡之必要，但將來是否設立共同委員會，則毫無所知。</p>
<p>問：大多數人以爲欲解決囤積問題，須展開國民運動，國府有無此項意向。</p>
<p>答：本處對此項問題，並無所聞。</p>
<p>問：今次公佈之囤積治罪條例，各方影響如何。</p>
<p>答：一般民衆，例如以家用爲中心之購買貯藏，並非治罪條例之對象，故民衆就民牛見地上觀之，絕對歡迎國府此舉，但囤積商則不免怨此法令太嚴，不過囤積如能根絕，即無問題，何如在此時洗手不幹囤積行爲，憬然覺悟。（雲鵬：譯自五月十一日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c54">不滿現實的人 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 朱飛</p>
<p>凡是不滿現實的人，都離不開「上進」和「墮落」的二個趨向，明白些說，就是有一種人，因爲他對於現實環境的不滿，於是激發起奮鬬的決心，時時充實自己，鞭策自己，向惡劣的環境搏鬬，爭取光明的來臨。另外一種人，他雖然對現實環境不滿，可是他沒有向環境　鬬的決心，他只知道嘴中空咦着一片牢騷，或者腦海中幻想着新環境美麗的迷夢。還有一種人，因爲不滿現實，於是消極悲觀，找尋無聊的刺激，結果精神肉體，遭受了極大的損害。這三菰人當中，除了第一種人是　進的以外，其條兩種人都是同走上墮落的一途，所不同的五十步與百步之分罷了。</p>
<p>國家不安，社會不寗的時候，一般現狀，都是難以令人滿意的，尤其是青年人，他富有靑春的活力，沸騰的熱血，高尙的意志，在沒有被罪惡薰染的時候，像無韁小馬一樣的放縱。因此對於現狀都是表示不滿的。</p>
<p>不滿現實環境的人，他的前途才是有希望的，但是我們應當注意的對於現狀的不滿，不是在口頭上發幾句牢騷，和空喚幾聲口號而已，我們必須立定決心，充實自己的知能，磨鍊自己的意志，抓住時機，向環境作猛力的搏鬬，才能得到勝利的收穫。假使不滿現實，僅是口頭上的牢騷和空喚口號，而不知去努力奮鬬，這樣不但不會有上進的希望，而且有近於墮落的危險，至於因不滿現狀而消極頽唐的舉動，是萬萬要不得的。</p>
<p>胸無主宰，意志不堅定，爲環境所轉移的人，是沒有希望的，好說大話，虎而不實的人，是最危險的，只有意志堅强，脚踏實地去苦幹的，前途才是有造就，有希望的！我們不滿現實，同時我們要有奮鬬的決心，光明的大道，才會在我們的前面！</p>
<h3 id="c55">「人生」與「環境」 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>任何人，自從呱呱墮地以來，就無時無刻不在「環境」中生長，直等待心臟不跳動了，血液不循環了，始能脫離了它。所以，「人生」至於「環境，」猶如樹木與土地，一刹那也不能分離；一分離便不能生長了。</p>
<p>「環境」旣爲「人生」朝夕相處，一刹也不能分離；那末「環境」之舒適與吾，對於「人生」，豈不造有密切關係嗎？</p>
<p>從外表上看來，一個「舒適」的「環境」，可使「人生」感覺到「舒適」亦「快樂」；似乎是塵世中最好的環境。可是若更進一步來觀察，它給了「人生」的，不是利益，却是害處；試擦目一瞥，何處不見「人生」因「舒適」而「奢侈」，因「快樂」而「怠惰」嗎？結果，「人生」免不了走上「退化」之路，爲天然所淘汰。</p>
<p>而一個「缺陷」的「環境」，若從字義上着想，似乎它給人生是「痛苦」與「艱難」，該是「人生」「快樂」的一大障碍。然而我們若從另一方面看來，不是有許多有爲的靑年，因感覺「人生」的「痛苦」而去追求「快樂」的「人生」嗎？因遭受「人生」的「艱難，」而覺得自己技能的不够，而努力求學嗎？……結果一個個成功了，使世界更「文明」更「燦爛」……。</p>
<p>由此看來，「舒適」的「環境」，雖然可使「人生」感覺到「快樂」與「舒適」；但使「人生」意志消沉，容易走上陋落之路，而「缺陷」的「環境」則否。試觀自古迄今，那一個發明家，偉人，不是生長於「缺陷」的「環境」中嗎？而且都是經歷不斷「艱難」而成功的。所以：</p>
<p>「舒適」的「環境」，猶如一粒含有「糖衣」的「毒藥」；而「缺陷」的「環境」，却是一粒含有「苦味」的「補藥」。</p>

<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>今日劇壇的發展，不能不說是在蓬勃中，在興盛中，在爭取廣大的觀衆中；但是，這種蓬勃，這種興盛，以及這種爭取，是否是正常的，正當的，還是畸形的，手段的，不正常的？我想，該是後者的。</p>
<p>因爲劇壇的發展是崎形的，手段的，不正常的；所以筆者以一個愛護戲劇者的立塲，提出下列數點自以爲的「危機」，作爲先進專家作討論的村料。</p>
<p>一，劇本方面</p>
<p>甲，內容：孟朗先生曾在「白茅」上指出，今日的戲劇，內容是「情節曲折，劇情熱閙」，演出是「雜要化」，一味迎合觀衆心理，……這些已有討論，不再贅言了。</p>
<p>乙，形式；筆者對於一切新形式的嘗試，是決不反對的；但是，對於一種以新形式的美名，來作號召，來賣野人頭，來欺騙觀衆，我是反對的。</p>
<p>丙，故事的來源：事變以來，改編劇在在皆是，創作可以說是「稀品一。關於這一點，筆者的意見如下：（一）改編不妨，但決不能把它當着劇本主要的源流，主要的源流，仍應是創作劇本。（二）改編的方法，我們要打倒看見的翰，就改作張三，見是瑪麗，就改作某某小妣，再刪去點臺詞，加一點噱頭的方法。（三）改編劇的內容，須合乎現實性，對觀衆的距離應該愈近愈好，更須有正確的主題。</p>
<p>丁，作家的問題：因爲演出多，作品少，於是就產生了粗製濫造的現象，補救這一點，就是掘發新人材，當然，我們對「新人」作品，是要另眼看待的。</p>
<p>二，演員方面</p>
<p>甲，制度問題：AB制的理論方面應該擁護，他可以使演員互相切磋，可以發掘新人材，對演出方面更有相當的幫助；但事實上，明爭暗鬬的局面下，確有改善之必要。對於明星制，我亦反對其存在，在此，筆者希望從事劇運的人員注意，抽上演稅是可以的，但是那種「主角」（？）抽千分之九，「跑龍套」的就抽千分之零的制度，完全是走向明星制的路上去的。</p>
<p>乙，演技方面：在目前的劇壞上，一部份的演員的演技。登峯超極之感，但這究竟是少數！大多數的演員，仍是停滯在某一點，這致成的原因，我以爲就是由於不嚴肅所致；那種上臺唱兩句，下臺脫說笑笑，祇知在兩性的圈子裏轉的人，不知凡幾，像這種人，那裏談得到　嚴肅」，那裏談得到進步，不停滯還有什麼？</p>
<p>丙，挖角問題：現在的演員，衹要中劇團的待遇優於乙劇團，那就立刻屬於甲劇團的麾下，若乙劇團再出高於甲劇團的待遇，則他或她立刻又屬於乙劇團的演員：當然，在這生活高漲的今日，誰不希望多得點收入；但是，這種情形的演進，演員無形做了拍賣家的商品，拍賣者，劇團，互相間猶似仇敵，水火不容；補救的方法，當然以「一元化」爲最好，但亦不易見諸事實；筆者以爲，不妨劇團間互相決定「市價」。</p>
<p>丁，健康問題：這一點不妨以報道來看：「白虹病了！」「沈敏病了，」「英子患肺病了，」「石　昏倒了，」「孫景璐昏倒了」……這些好像亦和劇壇在畸形的發展中，演員的致病，當然原因很多，但是，對於過度疲勞不無有因，亦就是對於一劇的長時間的演出，以及甲戲才演過，立刻上乙戲；上午排新戲，下午演戲地忙，毫無休息地忙是很有關係的。</p>
<p>三，劇評方面：</p>
<p>甲，形式：劇評的形式，現在差不多已成了公式了：開篇講故事，然後或是加一些，「故事評」或即接下去是「評」演員：張三「尚好」，李四「有進步」，這人「成功」，那人「失敗」，末了再加一些什麼燈光還好服裝嘸啥，草草而了之。我以爲以後報章副刋上倒不如　成一種表式給「劇評家」來塡寫，倒來得簡明。</p>
<p>乙，內容：現在上海的劇評有三派：一種是「好好先生」派，他祇指出戲的好處，而不指出缺點，他是不敢得罪於人的。第二種是「英雄主義」派，他們拚命找尋演出的缺點，吹毛求疵。第三鍾，那是極少極少的，態度嚴肅的，客觀多似主觀的劇評者，用冷靜的頭腦來分析事實，平心靜氣地批評演出，但是這種人，我敢說，通上海亦沒有幾個，還有一種是謾駡式的，一無足取。總之我們須要的是第三者，我們希望第一二種能漸趨正常，更撲滅那一些謾駡式的劇評。並識拔新進作品。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Strengthening the Police System <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of our country's police system has a history of several decades. Currently, police are established in all provinces, cities, counties, and districts. In terms of police education, both the central and local governments have police academies and temporary training classes. The Ministry of Interior considers police administration as a major internal affairs facility. In all these respects, the government in the past has made considerable efforts to promote the police system. However, upon further examination of its essence, the police in counties and districts are mostly insufficient to protect the people but more than enough to harm them, lending power to local tyrants and gentry, and viewed with suspicion alongside corrupt clerks and cunning officials. Although urban police pay slightly more attention to quality and training, due to meager salaries, their spirits are low, and most cannot fulfill their duties. The people's perception of them also cannot be improved. "Those who respect themselves are always respected by others; those who love themselves are always loved by others." If the police cannot respect and love themselves, the people naturally cannot respect and love them either. A state of animosity and opposition forms between them in spirit. Therefore, the ideals of police administration and the mission of the police are truly at odds with the reality of today, leaving one sighing deeply.</p>
<p>However, we cannot attribute the responsibility for the poor state of police administration entirely to the police or a few of the officials in charge. We know that the entire police system and police policy are determined by the competent authorities; at the same time, the government has the responsibility to supervise. If the government does not fundamentally value police administration, then the effectiveness and future of police administration will inevitably be bleak.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we believe that within the current peaceful areas, strengthening the police system is more important than expanding the army and intelligence work, and the re-establishment of the police system must be accelerated. I would like to offer my views on this matter as follows:</p>
<p>The army is responsible for defending the region, intelligence work is for detecting traitors and spies, and the responsibility of the police, in addition to protecting public security, policing traitors and spies, and partially substituting for the duties of the army and special agents, also has the greater mission of maintaining social morality and acting as teachers and protectors of the people. The police's education is not selective of location, time, or people, encouraging diligence, courage, and benevolence, teaching order, discipline, and mutual assistance, showing the people what they should strive for, what they should avoid, and what they should be wary of, and even popularizing legal knowledge among the people and promoting good habits in society, answering people's inquiries and providing guidance. All of these are the responsibilities of the police. In general, the police can do what the army and special agents do, but the army and special agents cannot do what the police do. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The most important task for the government internally at present is to promote the realization of comprehensive peace. It must first seek to strengthen the people's belief in peace within the peaceful areas, shifting from a scattered mentality to unity, and from disordered social order to order, with the ultimate goal of integrating the government and the people, sharing the same interests, and being concerned with each other's joys and sorrows. Among public officials, administrative officials merely execute administrative orders and do not have many opportunities to directly contact the people. Only the police are actually close to the people and in contact with them at all times and in all places. Therefore, the most suitable personnel to truly achieve the integration of the government and the people and promote this work are the police. Thus, the mission and tasks of the police are very important and arduous, even more so than those of the army and special agents. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Now that we understand that strengthening the police system is more urgent and important than expanding the army and special agents, we can see that the crux of the past failure of police administration lies in the emphasis on the army and special agents while neglecting police administration. Therefore, we hope that the government will pay close attention to the importance of police administration and expedite its strengthening as a matter of urgency. We would like to offer a few more humble opinions:</p>
<p>(1) Raise the salaries of the police so that they can maintain a minimum standard of living and serve with peace of mind. We acknowledge that some acts of fraud, bribery, and corruption arise from the impulse of being unable to make ends meet, which may not be entirely blameless. While legally inexcusable, it is perhaps somewhat pitiable. We have repeatedly heard police officers admit frankly:</p>
<p>"Relying on such meager salaries, I cannot even support myself, let alone take care of my family. If I don't make some extra money, am I supposed to starve to death?" We should take this reality seriously and request the government to raise police salaries before holding them accountable for their duties.</p>
<p>(2) Improve police education. Since the police also serve as teachers and protectors of the people, and the scope of education is extensive, they themselves must possess accurate and abundant knowledge to be competent. As for cultivating character and acquiring skills, both are essential training.</p>
<p>(3) Forging a sound physique is equally important. The spirit resides in the body. Without rigorous training, the spirit will become weak and lethargic, not only causing disrespect from the public but also making them incapable of handling stressful work in emergencies. The police originally took "sleepless and tireless" as their motto. Without a particularly sound physique, they will never be able to fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>(4) If the government secures police funding, raises police salaries, clearly defines police powers, and values the position of police officers, then scholars with superior knowledge and aspirations to serve will be happy to join the police force and enrich the police personnel.</p>
<p>(5) Japan's handling of police administration is world-renowned. There must be many relevant regulations and methods that can be used for reference. The government should send police personnel to conduct on-the-spot inspections and research to improve the system. At the same time, experts with experience and knowledge should be hired to assist in promoting police administration in China, to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Since strengthening police administration is more urgent than strengthening the army and special agents, and the activities of special agents are sufficient to weaken the function of police administration, it is hoped that the government should merge the funds and talent of special agents into police administration and integrate them into the overall police policy. We believe that if strictly implemented, not only will the foundation of excellent police administration be established, but the work of integrating the government and the people will also be greatly effective. We hope that the relevant authorities will take prompt action.</p>

<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki held cordial talks with Advisor Murata at the Manila Hotel for an hour from 8:30 AM on the 11th. Subsequently, from 9:40 AM, he held talks with Governor-General Vargas of the Philippines and other cabinet ministers of the executive government for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - After arriving here on the 10th, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki visited the military headquarters at 2:00 PM and listened to reports on the situation of the military government from the military government supervisor and the heads of various departments of the military government supervisor's office. In the evening at 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by the highest commander of the army in the Philippines at the Manila Hotel.</p>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - The highest commander of the army in the Philippines specially hosted a banquet for Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki at the Manila Hotel yesterday, inviting Vargas, the Governor-General of the Philippines, and other important figures from Japan and the Philippines to accompany him. Minister Aoki gave a speech on the spot, praising the efforts of the officials and people of the Philippines in assisting Japan in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and said: Premier Tojo is a man of justice and a statesman of the new era, so his words will surely be put into action. The conditions for the independence of the Philippines are about to be prepared, so Premier Tojo's words will soon be realized. From now on, the only problem is for all the people of the Philippines to continue their efforts to gain their freedom. Subsequently, the military government supervisor in the Philippines also said: There is no reason why the Philippines cannot gain independence. The people of the Philippines are now fully cooperating with Japan. Previously, there was hardly a single independent patriot in the Philippines like Rizal. Now, there are 18 million Rizals working to build a new Philippines.</p>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, who is currently traveling and inspecting the South, specially hosted a press delegation here at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, and spoke freely about his impressions of traveling in the South, generally saying: During my visit to various places in the South, I feel that all places can unanimously cooperate with Japan and make great efforts to complete the operation. This is due to the proper guidance of the local authorities and the mutual cooperation of the East Asian nations. I have witnessed that economic construction in various places is very creative and shows great effort. This is truly gratifying and should be admired. The cooperation of the indigenous people in various places is not different in its method of cooperation due to differences in national conditions and ethnicities. Although agriculture is very developed in various places in the South, industry is quite backward, but it has been able to utilize its characteristics and labor force to seize the total power. Burma deeply feels the importance of being on the front line, so the local people are full of fighting spirit and rise up in the war. The Indonesians of Java assist the Japanese in implementing policies in a peaceful atmosphere, which is truly worthy of our gratitude. The Philippines has been influenced by the special civilization of the United States and is dominated by a special environment, resulting in a special color in the industrial organization, but Governor-General Vargas and other enlightened people can understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and are committed to building a new Philippines, which is most evident in political and economic aspects. Today, the billion people of Greater East Asia have united and cooperated with each other. With the organic combination of Japan's science and technology and East Asia's inexhaustible materials and manpower, a unified economic zone has been formed. I cannot estimate how great its power is.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army Launches Second Phase of Operations in Taihang Mountains - Japanese Army in Hunan Province Achieves Great Battle Results <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency) - The significance of the second phase of operations launched by the Japanese army in the Taihang Mountains this time is first to thoroughly suppress the Communists. When the National Government entered the war, the Japanese government changed its policy toward China, and the Communist army publicized that the Japanese army would withdraw from China. This is not consistent with the facts. After the Japanese army annihilated the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing army, it carried out the second phase of operations in the Taihang Mountains, severely damaged the Communist army, and rescued the local people, making them understand that China has made a leap forward. Since this resolute battle, many generals of the Chongqing side have participated in the peace movement and supported the National Government. Therefore, the general public in the area is deeply suspicious of the dark politics of the Communist Party. Second, the anti-Communist army in China has fully exerted its strength. Since its reorganization in June of this year, the army has been fiercely trained. It recently participated in this operation, attacked north of She County, fully exerted its strength, and has repeatedly established military exploits, severely damaging the Communist army. Third, all Communist army facilities have been destroyed. The Communist army has various factories in the Jinji-Yu border area to manufacture weapons and ammunition using locally produced materials to achieve self-sufficiency in anti-Japanese combat power, and to use its remaining weapons to supply the western Hebei area. But after the Japanese army's fierce attack this time, its military, political, and economic facilities have all been destroyed. The Communist army in North China has been defeated in the western Hebei area, and now it has suffered heavy damage. It will probably be unable to rise again.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain place in southern Jin and the Taihang Mountains on the 11th, the Japanese army's sweeping battle against the Chongqing (24th Army Group) and the suppression battle in the Taihang Military Region are continuing. On the 9th, the Japanese army surrounded parts of the "8th Reserve Division of the 27th Army" of the Chongqing army, the "46th Regiment of the 40th Army," and the "8th Advance Column" around Dahui Village, northeast of Lingchuan, and thoroughly annihilated them. The corpses of the Chongqing army numbered 538, and 294 were captured. The Japanese army intercepted 2 heavy machine guns, 3 light machine guns, 186 rifles, 159 bayonets, and many other military supplies. At the same time, the results achieved by another unit of the Japanese army between the 8th and 9th were as follows: On the 8th, 2 weapons factories and 1 gunpowder factory were destroyed near Ancun (36 kilometers northwest of She County). On the same evening, a military uniform depot was discovered in Lijiazhai, 20 kilometers northwest of She County. On the 9th, two factories manufacturing rifle bullets were destroyed in the northwest of She County, seizing 100,000 rifle bullets, 80 horses, and a large amount of copper and iron.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain place in southern Taihang on the 11th, the Japanese army's sweeping battle against the remnants of the Chongqing (24th Army Group) is still continuing around Lin County and Lingchuan. It has now been determined that the results of the current Japanese army units are as follows: (1) On May 8, the Japanese army defeated a regiment of the 48th Brigade of the 27th Army of the Chongqing army near Hengshui Village, 16 kilometers south of Lingchuan. 93 soldiers of the Chongqing army were killed, including 1 general and 3 captains, and 30 were captured. The Japanese army also seized 4 light machine guns, 29 rifles, 2 grenade launchers, and extremely large amounts of other military supplies. (2) The Japanese army discovered a team belonging to the 19th Regiment of the 27th Army of the Chongqing army fleeing near the cliffs 16 kilometers south of Lingchuan and immediately defeated it. 71 soldiers of the Chongqing army were killed and 5 were captured. The Japanese army seized 1 heavy machine gun and 180 rifles. (3) On the 8th, the Japanese army intercepted the fleeing Chongqing army in the direction of Lin County and inflicted heavy damage on it. 23 soldiers of the Chongqing army were killed and 154 were captured, including 1 colonel and 1 lieutenant. The Japanese army seized 22 rifles and 860 rifle bullets.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since the 5th of this month, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking the 29th Army Group of the Chongqing army on the shores of Dongting Lake. Every day, they have been advancing more than 20 kilometers in the marshland unique to Hunan, and in one fell swoop, they have captured the key locations of Gaojiachang, Mao Caojie, Guan Dang, Meitian, and Hunan Mountain, which the Chongqing side boasted were as solid as gold. On the 7th, they successfully surrounded the Xiaojiawan, Tingjiazhou, and Sanxian Lake areas. They are attacking the Chongqing army wandering in the encirclement everywhere and have seized dozens of tons of various ammunition from the Chongqing army in the south of Nan County.

<h3 id="e4">Investigation and Statistics Department Smashes Chongqing Blue Shirts Society Organization in Hangzhou - All Eleven Criminals Arrested <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government launched the rural cleanup campaign in the north and south of the Yangtze River, bandits and puppets have no foothold in the peaceful areas. In order to reverse the decline, the bandits and puppets have not hesitated to resort to assassination and vicious means. In particular, the Blue Shirts Society of the Chongqing side has been unscrupulous and has repeatedly tried to move. Recently, they have dispatched large numbers of thugs to sneak into the Hangzhou urban area, attempting to assassinate government officials and disrupt public security. The Hangzhou agency of the Investigation and Statistics Department has taken thorough precautions, and the activities of the bandits and puppets have long been under surveillance. Therefore, when the time was right, it took swift and decisive action on May 4 to arrest all eleven criminals, including Yan Changwei, and seized seven firearms, two sharp weapons, and ten handcuffs intended for robbery. At the same time, a large number of documents were seized. This shocking assassination plan was eliminated invisibly. The details of the cracking of the case are recorded below: The director of the Southeast Office of the Chongqing Blue Shirts Society is Mao Wanli, the brother-in-law of Dai Li. Since deciding to start work in Hangzhou, Mao sneaked into Yuqian, western Zhejiang, to preside over and launch the members of the Zhejiang West Action Corps under his command to sneak into Hangzhou in batches to偵査 the residences and daily activities of government officials, and secretly transport firearms to Hangzhou, attempting to implement assassinations in the short term. However, the Hangzhou agency of the Investigation and Statistics Department had received many reports in advance and placed them under close surveillance. The case began with Zhang Weixian, the traffic officer of the Zhejiang West Action Corps, sneaking into Hangzhou, buying over the internal line Hu Wenqing, and on April 22, leading Hu to meet Mao Wanli in the countryside to determine the steps to commit the crime. After Hu returned to Hangzhou, he began to design and arrange. At this time, the giant of the Blue Shirts Society, Dai Li, happened to sneak into the five southeastern provinces. After hearing about the conspiracy plan, he immediately ordered Yu Wanjun, the captain of the third battalion of the Zhejiang West Action Corps, to quickly send personnel to assist. From the night of May 3, six people, including Gu Changji, the second company commander of Yu's battalion, Li Ming, the first organization chief, and action members Zhang Hongzhou, Wang Defu, Ding Bixiang, and Zhang Yonggen, carrying seven short guns and two sharp weapons, set out from Cangqian, Yuhang, and arrived at Xiaobeimen, near Wulin Dou, Hangzhou City, at about 3:00 AM on May 4. They sneaked into Zhang Yueying's house, a prostitute at No. 160, Dongyi, Kaixilu, and No. 30, Fengjiaer, and decided to meet at Zhang Yueying's house at 10:00 PM on May 4 and then set off. The conspiracy plan of the gang of thugs was to find a way to buy ten handcuffs on the afternoon of the 4th and go to Chengyou Company in Baoshan Lane that night to commit robbery and kidnap the manager of the company. Zhang would then carry the stolen goods and escape through Xiaobeimen, Yuecheng, to extort a large sum of money. Another group, led by Hu Wenqing, would go to the residence of a certain government official to carry out the assassination with the rest of the criminals. After the conspiracy was completed, they would all escape through Xiaobeimen, Yuecheng, to the outside of the city, and a part of the second company of the third battalion of the Zhejiang West Action Corps would be ambushed to respond and prevent the pursuit of the military police. The Hangzhou agency of the Investigation and Statistics Department paid close attention to the thugs when they sneaked into Hangzhou. Since then, all kinds of activities of the thugs have been under surveillance, so they were not immediately arrested in order to catch them all in one fell swoop. At 9:00 PM on May 4, cadres were first dispatched and, together with friendly military police, went to the house of Zhang Yueying, a prostitute at Kaixilu, and arrested the main criminals Hu Wenqing and the first group paper chief Li Ming, action member Zhang Hongzhou, and detained the related persons Zhang An and Zhang Yueying. They then folded back to No. 30, 丯jiaer, and arrested the second company commander Yan Changwei, traffic officer Zhang Weixian, action members Ding Bixiang, Wang Fafu, and Zhang Yonggen, and seized one No. 2 wooden case, one No. 3 wooden case, one revolver, four Mauser pistols, two sharp weapons, more than 90 bullets, and various documents. The next day, an action criminal, Wang Songtao, was arrested outside Wulinmen. At this point, the assassination organization of the Chongqing Blue Shirts Society in Hangzhou has been completely destroyed, its vicious conspiracy has been crushed, and the public security of Hangzhou has been ensured. Now all the criminals have confessed after examination and are being detained and handled separately by the department. The names of all the criminals, the seized weapons, and all the certifying documents are recorded below: Hu Wenqing is a school internal line dispatched by the third battalion of the Zhejiang West Action Corps, Zhang Weixian is the traffic officer of the battalion, Yan Changwei is the second company commander of the battalion, Ding Bixiang is the action member of the second company of the battalion, Wang Fafu is the action member of the second company of the battalion, Li Ming is the first group leader of the second company of the battalion, Zhang Hongzhou is the action member of the second company of the battalion, Zhang Yonggen is the traffic officer of the third battalion, Wang Songtao is a related criminal of the battalion, Zhang Yixiang is a related person of the third battalion, and Zhang Yueying is a prostitute.

<h3 id="e7">Economic Figures Observe Further Development of Currency Policies Following the Ministry of Finance's Prohibition of Enemy Currencies <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - After the Ministry of Finance issued a public notice yesterday prohibiting the possession, use, and transaction of British pounds, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, a prominent figure in economic circles observed that this was the most appropriate measure to sever the relationship between Chinese currency and enemy state currencies. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British pound and US dollar, as well as currencies related to the Greater East Asia Yen, have become hostile, and the market has presented an unclear trading situation. Later, the Japanese Governor of Hong Kong announced the methods for exchanging and using them with military scrip, and recently issued a notice prohibiting their possession and use. Although British pounds and US dollars have not disappeared in various places after our country joined the war, patriotic people with knowledge had long regarded them as enemy currencies, and people in economic circles also believed that they should be explicitly prohibited. Recently, the situation has deteriorated, and our government specifically issued a notice from the Ministry of Finance (Qian Er Yu No. 4) on the 10th, explicitly prohibiting the possession, use, and sale of the aforementioned enemy currencies. This move can be regarded as a major settlement boundary against the economic aggression of Britain and the United States for a century. At the same time, the issuance of Japanese military scrip will also be stopped, and efforts will be made to accelerate its recovery. In the future, the financial market will become unified with Central Reserve Bank notes at an appropriate time. Due to the implementation of the crackdown on enemy currencies, our country's currency policy will inevitably have more epoch-making developments and gains.</p>

<p>Southern Front, Indo-Burmese Border, 11th (Central News Agency) - Buthidaung, a major stronghold of the British Indian Army on the southern front of the Indo-Burmese border, was captured by Japanese troops on the evening of the 9th after a fierce attack from the east and west. The enemy forces in that area are now on the verge of collapse. At the same time, the Japanese troops who achieved great victories in the previous Indian campaign are coordinating with the friendly forces who captured Buthidaung, continuing to advance along the Bay of Bengal with irresistible force. In early May, they seized Akyab, an important location in the Bay of Bengal, approaching 25 kilometers south of Maungdaw, completely cutting off the enemy's connection with Buthidaung. Now, the enemy forces in that area are on the verge of collapse before the monsoon season arrives, while the Japanese troops on the Mayu Peninsula have overcome all kinds of harsh natural conditions and are fighting day and night on all fronts, determined to annihilate the enemy and ensure that none survive.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Today's London news reveals that military scholars opposing the Axis are reviewing the general war situation in the Pacific but cannot definitively determine where the Japanese army's next operation will strike from. As for the British counterattacks on Japanese positions, they have temporarily abandoned operations after failing to recapture Akyab as a base for bombing Rangoon.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters news obtained by the Allied Press today, the British army's retreat from Buthidaung to the northwest and west, although not unexpected, has provoked a strong reaction in London. Buthidaung was the British army's most forward base in the Arakan campaign, the purpose of which was clearly to occupy Akyab. Due to the British army's setbacks in that area, their plan to defend the eastern side of India and obtain a base for the next battle has failed. Reuters news acknowledged that the Japanese army excels at jungle warfare, and the British Indian Army is clearly no match for them. The Japanese army's strategy is to first infiltrate the British lines with small units, supplemented by flank movements, and then consolidate their position. Therefore, once the Japanese army secures a foothold, it quickly becomes a base, and then a strong fortress. At that time, the Japanese army will transfer fresh troops to reinforce the front-line combat troops. It is reported that the Japanese army's ability to gain a firm foothold on the Buthidaung-Maungdaw road and force the British army to retreat is in accordance with the aforementioned steps. London sources believe that the British army's failure this time has other reasons as follows: (1) The Buthidaung area is easy to attack but difficult to defend, (2) The British army failed to consolidate the positions they gained in Maungdaw and Buthidaung at the beginning of the Arakan campaign and could not cut off the Japanese army's supply lines, (3) British soldiers cannot live on meager and simple rations, while the Japanese army is at ease and continues to fight as usual, (4) Experienced troops suffered too many casualties, especially from malaria, (5) The Arakan campaign is in one of the world's most virulent malaria epidemic areas, and it was difficult to control the epidemic in the army in mid-March. When the monsoon season arrives, it will become even more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Gayda Infers Future War Situation: European Defense Plan Completed; Axis Military Strength Is Strong and Different from North Africa; However, the Mediterranean Remains the Center of the Battlefield <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>11th (Central News Agency) - The sacrificial operations of the Axis forces in North Africa have completed the fortification of the European continent. The Axis forces have now completed an invincible posture in both offense and defense. Gayda, the chief writer of the Italian newspaper, analyzes the future trend of the European war, stating: "The war of the British and American imperialists has focused on the African continent for three years. During this period, the Italian people have fully demonstrated that they are a nation that trusts the soldiers on the front lines and can undertake any war. The enemy has promoted that the Italian interior will be defeated, which has now been proven to be completely empty talk. The enemy should also be aware of this, so the enemy repeatedly bombs Italian field hospitals, hospital ships, and indiscriminately strafes non-combatants with machine guns, attempting to disrupt the morale of the Italian people. The war of the British and American imperialists has gradually shifted from the African continent to the European mainland, but the fact that the Mediterranean remains the center of the battlefield has not changed. The war has entered a new stage, so the advantages and disadvantages of the war situation will also change. The Axis forces have now completed their European defense plan, which can be demonstrated by future facts. Italy has completed its coastal defense and air defense with air forces and all kinds of weapons. If the Allied forces invade the European continent, they will know the strength of the Axis weapons and forces. Excellent and strong European mainland operations are different from North African operations because reinforcements are faster and more efficient."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, the "Helsingborg Daily" warns the general public not to overestimate the victory of the British and Americans in North Africa. The newspaper claims that many people have a completely wrong idea about the military effectiveness of the Western powers. The newspaper reiterated that the British and American victory in Tunisia was due to the numerical superiority of the troops, but a decisive victory on the European continent is another matter. Although the Axis is fighting in the East, it still has many troops in Europe.</p>
<p>Resistance of German and Italian Forces on Cape Bon Peninsula Not Weakened</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a message released here officially tonight, the resistance of the German and Italian forces who retreated to the mountains southeast of Tunis and the Cape Bon Peninsula has not collapsed. British tank columns created a fairly large gap in the Axis' new line on Sunday, but part of it has been recovered by German and Italian counterattacks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports that according to a report last night by a British correspondent from the Tunisian front, the encirclement of Cape Bon, the last Axis bridgehead in North Africa, has now been closed. Allied warships and aircraft have blockaded this rocky peninsula. However, the Axis forces show no signs of withdrawing from Cape Bon. The rumor that General Arnim, commander of the German forces in Tunisia, has left Africa cannot be confirmed. Last night, the British correspondent reported that Axis troops coming from the south in a certain location in Africa are now entering the coastal rock fortresses one after another. The Allied forces have not yet been able to cut off the road to Cape Bon. British troops operating from the Hammam Lif base along the Gulf of Tunis have reportedly invaded the Sulayman plain between the Gulf of Tunis and Hammamet. German forces are now fiercely resisting the advance of British and American forces in the southwest of this area. The rearguard, supported by artillery units, is covering the Axis retreat to Cape Bon in the areas of Zaghouan and Enfidaville. The troops concentrated there on Sunday evening are estimated at about 80,000. Vast minefields are hindering the advance of the British Eighth Army and the U.S. XIX Corps. There is still fierce fighting 10 kilometers northwest of Zaghouan for Sidi Tir, which is held by the Germans. Resistance by Axis forces south of Hammamet has increased in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that the British claim that General von Manteuffel, commander of a German armored division operating in Tunisia, was captured in Bizerte is incorrect because he was injured in action in North Africa and has been receiving treatment in a hospital in Germany for some time.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Both German and Soviet Armies are Preparing to Launch Large-Scale Offensives; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kuban River Estuary; Soviet Troops Attempted to Land on Taman Island but Failed <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - German military experts recently expressed their views on the development of the Eastern Front, stating that the muddy season on the Eastern Front has completely ended, and large-scale operations are now possible. While it is impossible to predict when and where the German and Soviet armies will launch major offensives, it is evident that both sides are preparing for such actions. Specifically: 1. The Soviet Union has largely succeeded in thoroughly mobilizing men and actively expanding its military industry to compensate for the personnel losses suffered during the winter campaign. However, this is only in terms of quantity; the quality of the soldiers is far inferior to what it was at the beginning of the winter counter-offensive. 2. The Soviet army seems to have regained its previous strength in terms of weaponry. For example, in the battle for the Kuban bridgehead, its heavy weapons have greatly increased. Regarding the air force, judging from the number of Soviet aircraft shot down daily, it is clear that its quality has not improved at all, although its quantitative increase is noteworthy. It is generally said that the Soviet army is adopting a purely defensive posture outside of the Kuban area, but I disagree. Although Timoshenko's offensive at Kharkov in the spring of 1942 failed, it seems that they are now waiting for the German offensive. However, as a result of their excessive nervousness, they might launch an offensive themselves. If they do, it would only provide the well-prepared German army with an easy target.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front reports, Soviet troops in the Kuban River estuary area launched an offensive with new tank units nine miles northeast of Novorossiysk on the 10th. They engaged in fierce fighting with the defending German-Romanian forces. Because the area is mountainous, the Soviet operations were significantly hampered. At the same time, a swift German shock force attacked from the flank, causing heavy Soviet casualties. Furthermore, due to the stalemate on the Taman Peninsula, the Soviet army attempted to land on the northwestern part of the peninsula with mechanized infantry aboard 30 landing craft. However, after being spotted by the German air force, it appears that all of them were sunk. Meanwhile, aerial combat across the entire Eastern Front has intensified recently. The German air force, which controls the skies, has achieved great victories in recent days. According to German authorities, the German air force shot down 41 Soviet aircraft on the 10th. In the week from May 2nd to the 8th, they shot down a total of 474 Soviet aircraft, while German losses were 36 aircraft.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Argentine Foreign Minister stated that the Argentine government has dismissed Vallee, its consul in Miami, USA, for publicly making anti-Japanese remarks in the United States. This action by the Argentine government is seen as a measure to strictly maintain its neutral stance and is therefore noteworthy.</p>

<p>— Translated from "Kaizo" May Issue</p>
<p>Date: April 9, Year 32 (1943)</p>
<p>Attendees:</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Ōkawa Shūmei</p>
<p>Tachibana Shiraki</p>
<p>Matsumoto Shigeharu</p>
<p>Yamamoto Jitsuhiko</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Time is short, so let's have Mr. Ōkawa speak first...</p>
<p>Ōkawa: After listening to Mr. Chen's words, my worries have mostly disappeared. The worry was because I haven't been to Shanghai this year and didn't know the actual situation there. As you know, at the end of last year, there were only nine rice distribution centers in Shanghai. Now that you say the supply of goods in China has increased, the number of distribution centers must have increased as well. You say that prices have gone down, so prices in Shanghai must have gone down too. In times like these, if we don't quickly alleviate the suffering of the people, the situation will be impossible to manage.</p>
<p>I agree with Mr. Tachibana that the local communities should be the pillars of the Chinese nation. However, it seems to me that since the war began, there has been a great deal of migration in the past seven years. I think that perhaps 40 million people have left their homes, either temporarily or permanently, and moved elsewhere. As a result, the elders in the villages have lost their authority, and some of them have also moved to Shanghai or nearby, not wanting to return to their homes. This has allowed gangs of evildoers to seize power and destroy the old society. If we don't find a way to remedy this situation quickly, Chinese society as a whole will inevitably collapse. So I think it would be best to increase the rice rations, even if it's just a spoonful or two. People are having a hard time because they don't have oil, so it would be best to give them a little more cheap oil as well. We have to do this, and we have to find a solution. I am worried about whether there will be chaos before that plan is implemented. Since you say there is no need to worry about that, then that's great.</p>
<p>Chen: I am truly grateful to Mr. Ōkawa for his heartfelt concern about the situation in our country. Now, let me give a brief explanation about this issue.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the reception held by the Minister of Greater East Asia, I made the following statement: No matter how impoverished we are, we can manage other goods and materials, and we have a favorable surplus for the Greater East Asia War. However, rice is the only thing we can't manage. Let me explain further:</p>
<p>I have studied the rice problem. The first time foreign rice was imported into China was in the sixth year of the Tongzhi era. At that time, the foreign rice was mainly imported from Saigon and Burma. According to the average statistics from the Ministry of Industry five years before the Incident, China imported 16 million shi of foreign rice per year. 80% of that was imported into the Guangdong and Guangxi areas, and the remaining 20%, or 3.2 million shi, was imported into Shanghai and the Yangtze River area. That was the average statistic for the past years. From this, it can be seen that the amount of foreign rice imported into China each year was quite large. After the Incident, the countryside was destroyed, and the fields were left barren, which was a great blow to rice production. As a result, it goes without saying that there is an increasing urgency for rice, not only domestically, but also for the 16 million shi of foreign rice that had to be imported. Even for the 3.2 million shi of foreign rice that had to be imported into Shanghai and the Yangtze River area, there are no ships to bring it in. Therefore, we have to bear that amount ourselves. Moreover, the demand for rice has now increased, so we are in a very difficult situation. For this reason, we are now trying to increase production on the one hand and import rice from abroad on the other. I think that in order to import rice from abroad, we must restore transportation, rely on your country's assistance, and use ships or other means to import foreign rice into the country as we did before. Buying rice from foreign countries was something that was done during the Qing dynasty, and it's not something that's starting now. I hope that we can first try to restore the situation of buying foreign rice as before.</p>
<p>I served as the Minister of Industry from 1932 to 1935. At that time, what I worked on was increasing the production of cotton and rice. Among them, we achieved very good results in increasing the production of cotton. In 1932, the year I took office, the annual harvest was only 600,000 dan, but by 1935, when I left office, it had increased to 12 million dan. In 1936, it increased to 15 million dan. So as long as we work hard and study, we can always gradually improve. However, once the Incident occurred, this plan was completely stopped, and the work was destroyed. As for the problem of rice or wheat, I also made efforts to improve seeds and other things. For example, we would bring farmers from certain places, lend them land, and try out rice improvement there, and then replant the rice harvested by the farmers. We carried out seed improvement in this way for four or five years. That continued until the Incident, and the improvement began in 1932.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the movement of people, the people were very displaced and miserable at that time. However, if we look at the routes of their movement, they can be divided into three: one to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, one to the Shanghai concession, and one to Hong Kong. Recently, they have been gradually coming back. Most of those who are coming back are returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Now, Mr. Matsumoto...</p>
<p>Matsumoto: There's not much time left, so I'll just say a few simple things.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Mr. Chen's visit to our country, I would like to talk about two things that I would like Mr. Chen to take back with him, which are the feelings of us Japanese people.</p>
<p>The first is the Japanese people's unwavering belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War. This is something that I must ask Mr. Chen to take back with him for sure. Moreover, this is a real fact, and there is no need to explain it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Japanese people now hope that the Chinese people will quickly become strong. This sentiment is also something that I must ask Mr. Chen to take back with him for sure.</p>
<p>Speaking of the way to strengthen, I think that the so-called total war can ultimately be divided into three items: military warfare, economic warfare, and ideological warfare. Regarding military warfare, Mr. Chen just said that the graduates of the military academy have already achieved very good results, so we hope that it will continue to develop more and more.</p>
<p>Regarding the economy, we believe that Mr. Chen is also considering various planned economic control measures with his many years of experience. Especially since Mr. Chen gave a very realistic explanation of the state of affairs, which is still not optimistic, we feel very confident instead.</p>
<p>Regarding production, Chinese people have previously made various criticisms, such as not being suitable for joint-stock companies. I think that the organization of joint-stock companies and so on has passed, and now we need business people who can adapt to the demands of the new era. Moreover, we need business people who can break out of the consciousness of people like the so-called Zhejiang financial clique and make further progress.</p>
<p>Next is about production, purchase and distribution. Needless to say, they are mutually related. However, I think that the simplest way to produce results is to make the purchasing organization more efficient. Also, on the part of the control association, the issue of lower-level organizations should be considered important. I think that after it succeeds, production will definitely be on the right track. As for distribution, I think there are already various experiences in the distribution of rice. However, for distribution control, I think that a lower-level organization like the neighborhood association in Japan is really necessary. In Japan, it took three or four years for this organization to achieve the results it has today. China has not yet completed the census, so it is very difficult to implement distribution after all. However, now places like Hong Kong are also fully implementing rice distribution, so as long as you do it, you may be able to do it well. In addition to rice, I think other goods can also be distributed. I hope that these things can be done thoroughly and I wish you success.</p>
<p>Next is the issue of ideological warfare. We feel that until recently, the center of political thought for Chinese people has been the freedom and independence of the nation. We think that Chinese people should go one step further and quickly seek a strong alliance of the nations of Greater East Asia in the current situation, set up a common front, and destroy Britain and the United States. That kind of consciousness is the most important. In my heart, I have long been hoping that Chinese people would have that kind of consciousness. At the third anniversary of the return to the capital, I heard Chairman Wang's speech, which emphasized the consciousness of Greater East Asians in Greater East Asia, and emphasized the idea of being a Greater East Asian on top of being a Chinese person, which is the foundation. After listening to it, I felt very satisfied.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers are now fighting on the front lines. They have the spirit of "fighting for the Emperor", and they also have the awareness of "fighting for Japan"; however, they are also truly aware of "fighting for Greater East Asia". Therefore, the guiding class of China should not be limited to cheap egalitarianism or formal reciprocity (international, equal status), but must truly regard China and Japan as brothers and cooperate with each other. The independence and freedom of the Chinese nation is not the highest purpose, there is an even greater purpose—if the political consciousness is raised in that way, that would be great. However, in order to raise the political consciousness in that way, the practical issue - that is, the reconstruction of trust between China and Japan - is really necessary. If there is no trust between China and Japan, then China will never extract a larger so-called Greater East Asian consciousness from the so-called Chinese consciousness and cooperate with Japan from this consciousness. However, China's participation in the war can be regarded as a result of trusting Japan, so Japan took this opportunity to implement a new policy, thereby turning the things that Japan determined in the Konoe statement five years ago and that were determined by the Japan-China Basic Treaty between China and Japan three years ago into facts that are implemented in reality; therefore, the reconstruction of trust between the people and the nation can gradually be realized more and more. Because of the gradual realization of this situation, we hope that the Chinese gentlemen will also break through the shell of the so-called Chinese national consciousness and awaken to the consciousness of Greater East Asia as one nation; we hope that they will rapidly become strong with this consciousness.</p>
<p>This may be rude, but I think that Japan is the older brother and China is the younger brother. The older brother and the younger brother hold hands and stand on the front line. The older brother expects the younger brother to be strong enough to surpass the older brother. However, because the older brother is working hard every day to ensure that he will never be inferior to the younger brother, he hopes that the younger brother will also strive to become stronger with the courage to surpass the older brother. Although these are very vulgar words, I would like to offer this point to Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>Chen: Time is pressing, so let me just say a few simple thoughts.</p>
<p>I completely agree with what Mr. Matsumoto said about the various concerns about China. I feel that those words seem to be what I want to say in my heart. Although I have not had a thorough meeting with everyone, China is now working hard as Mr. Matsumoto said. Regarding economic problems, everyone knows that the practices of the Zhejiang financial clique are detrimental to China, but I go even further and believe that they are detrimental to East Asia. Moreover, not only the Zhejiang financial clique, but other groups similar to the Zhejiang financial clique are also detrimental to Greater East Asia, so I think that this type of clique must be completely eliminated. Because I am aware that our China will share the responsibility of Greater East Asia permanently today and in the future, I have that kind of argument.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the method of rice distribution, I have long heard that the neighborhood system practiced in Japan is effective, but there is already something called household registration in China, which is somewhat similar to the neighborhood system in Japan, and we are now using this household registration organization to carry out distribution. The population of China is not clear, not only today, but since the Tang Dynasty. At that time, troops were dispatched overseas, from Korea in the east to Tibet in the west. Those soldiers later became mercenaries. As a result, there were various soldiers who were hired out from their homes. In this way, the household registration became unclear. Because they could be hired out so casually, they could not know as clearly as in Japan how old the people in a certain family were. The population of China was originally in that state. Recently, because of the necessity of rice distribution, we are rushing to investigate the household registration.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the ideological problem, China has now launched a New National Movement. This New National Movement is not just doing things like youth groups and youth leagues on the surface, but is deciding on three fundamental policies.</p>
<p>The first is to move from individualism to national collectivism.</p>
<p>The second is to move from liberal capitalism to national socialism.</p>
<p>The third is to move from narrow nationalism to broad national groupism.</p>
<p>This third policy, as Mr. Matsumoto said, is not only about the freedom and independence of the Republic of China, but also guides the so-called Greater East Asia idea. Thanks to your various concerns, these are now being implemented. As Mr. Matsumoto said just now, Japan is an advanced country, it is the older brother, and China is the younger brother, which is absolutely correct. Also, the older brother is on the front line, fighting desperately abroad, and the younger brother is doing various housework at home, which can fully express the relationship between China and Japan now. However, the younger brother feels uneasy about the fact that the older brother is fighting desperately abroad, while he is only doing housework at home. Therefore, I hope that the older brother can observe that the younger brother's heart has the enthusiasm to go to the front line and fight outside together.</p>
<p>Today, I am very grateful to be able to open my heart and pour out my feelings to everyone.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: We have taken up a lot of valuable time, and we should be very grateful.</p>
<p>Chen: (At the time of parting) Mr. Hashikawa has done a lot of research on the Three Principles of the People. Please come to China once, it would be great. I would really like to have a long talk with you.</p>
<p>Tachibana: I went to your country once at the end of last year, but I haven't been to Shanghai yet. (Translated by Ding) —End—</p>

<h3 id="e27">Military Rationing Authorities Decide to Adjust Sugar Prices; Third Phase of Sugar Distribution Set for the 15th; Purchase from Retailers with Coupons <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>After the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office implemented per capita sugar rationing, the issuance of sugar coupons was handled by the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Food Administration Bureau. The Cooperative Office distributes the sugar approved for rationing by the military rationing authorities on a monthly basis to Grade A retailers according to proportion for per capita distribution and for the needs of various industries. The sugar rationed for the previous month was 16,000 bags, which has already been distributed one after another. The original plan was to start the third phase of per capita sugar rationing on the 11th of this month, with sugar coupons to be used to purchase from Grade A retailers with the same numbers. Our reporter learned from the Cooperative Office yesterday that the military rationing authorities have decided to adjust sugar prices. The price of the per capita sugar ration for the third phase will be based on the adjusted price, and the quantity will be the same as in the second phase, with each person being able to purchase half a catty (0.5kg) with a coupon. It is scheduled to start sales on the 15th of this month, with a validity period until May 31st. Detailed information will be announced by the Cooperative Office in conjunction with the authorities.</p>
<p>Oil Sales in the Nanshi District</p>
<p>The wholesale office of the local edible oil industry has already started the general sale of oil in the two concessions and the western Shanghai districts since the 7th of this month, based on the per capita oil rationing with house tax receipts. However, due to procedural issues, the Nanshi district did not start selling at the same time. It is now known that the goods have been dispatched to retail stores in the district yesterday and sales have begun. Residents can purchase from the designated retail oil stores of each Lianbao (joint guarantee system) with their household registration certificates and residence certificates, at a price of 5 yuan and 1 jiao (0.1 yuan) per 4 liang (200g). The sales time is from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day and will end on the 20th of this month. Within the above-mentioned specified date and time, residents can purchase the amount they are entitled to from the designated oil stores. Retail oil stores must not refuse sales or adulterate or short-weight the oil, and those who violate this will have their distribution suspended and reported to the authorities for handling.</p>

<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's fourth phase of distribution has seen wholesalers and retailers pay and collect their goods since the 5th. It is reported that the goods distributed include Double Axe, Quanlu, Jin Dalou, and Red Rose from the Japanese Zhonghua Tobacco Company, as well as Beauty and Golden Rat from Huacheng, White Gold Dragon, Golden Dragon, Big Lianzhu, and Treasure Sword from Nanyang, Big and Small Champagne from Dadong, and Golden Pagoda from Fuxin. However, the products from the Jun Guan Li Yi Zhong Tobacco Company will be distributed in the fifth phase on the 15th due to procedural issues. After receiving the fourth phase of distribution, all licensed cigarette dealers will sell the distributed goods in accordance with the association's new sales method, distributing them evenly over ten days, with a limit of one pack per person per day, starting from yesterday. The association will impose sanctions based on the severity of the circumstances if there are refusals to sell or attempts to profiteer.</p>

<p>The Shanghai News United Association convened an editorial committee meeting of its member newspapers at 2:00 PM yesterday. Editors and writers from various newspapers attended and participated. Chen Yanyun chaired the meeting to discuss how various newspapers would take the same steps regarding the Zhang case.

<h3 id="e30">Damaged Banknotes Exchanged as Usual; Wei Gen Currency Fully Exchanged for New; Ignore Merchants Who Cause Trouble <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has decided to exchange damaged New Legal Tender banknotes as much as possible to facilitate payments by all sectors of society. Therefore, the trend of refusing to accept damaged banknotes in the market has long dissipated. However, recently, general vendors and small businesses have once again stirred up trouble, using various excuses to refuse to accept damaged banknotes, which has caused considerable inconvenience to citizens and has had a great impact on finance. According to inquiries by reporters from Shanghai News Agency, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank is still exchanging damaged banknotes as usual, and there is no change in the method. The occurrence of refusals in the market is due to the troublemaking of market vendors and can be ignored. Citizens who have damaged banknotes can directly exchange them at the Central Reserve Bank. (1) Banknotes that are damaged by less than one-quarter and have complete signatures and numbers will be exchanged at full value. (2) Banknotes that are damaged by more than one-quarter but have complete signatures and numbers will be exchanged at half value. (3) Banknotes that are damaged by more than one-half will not be exchanged. (4) Banknotes that have been burned or water damaged but have complete and clear signatures and numbers can be handled in accordance with the above points 1 and 2 after providing a guarantor. (5) Banknotes that have been deliberately drawn, cut, or damaged, or that have written text, will not be exchanged even if the signatures and numbers are complete. (6) Banknotes that have been pieced together will not be exchanged.</p>

<p>The Special Second Court convened at 9:00 AM yesterday to hear the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Socks and Shirts Factory in the French Concession, who died after suffering severe torture. The deceased's family, accompanied by their lawyer, arrived on time. The defendants, Zhu Songcheng, Guo Shiyuan, Zai Shu, Li Hongkui, and two others, were escorted to court by French Concession police officers. It was noted that yesterday's hearing was of an investigative nature and, according to law, was not open to the public. However, approximately two thousand people gathered to observe the proceedings. Despite the strenuous efforts of both the court and the prosecutor's office to persuade them to leave, many remained. The court then permitted them to stay. Subsequently, due to the disruption of order and difficulty in conducting the investigation, the court ordered an immediate halt to the proceedings at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Minister Luo Declares Two Points Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the hearing, the Chief Prosecutor and the President of the Special Second Court reported the course of the hearing to Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and sought instructions. They visited Minister Luo again at 3:00 PM. To ensure safety, Minister Luo dispatched a squad of armed tax police to the Special Second Court to provide security and maintain order. When interviewed by a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, Minister Luo declared two points. First, the dismissal of French Concession police chief Millet and the investigation and trial by the French Consulate Court were not inappropriate. Although the French government has declared its intention to relinquish extraterritorial rights in China, the Chinese government should, of course, respect existing treaties or agreements until new ones are signed. As the head of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, I cannot endorse demands that circumvent legal procedures. Second, the Shanghai citizens' great concern for the Zhang case is understandable and deserves sympathy. However, citizens should have absolute respect for the sanctity of the law and the order of the court, and should jointly uphold this principle. It is rumored that the defendant Guo Shiyuan, relying on his gang, often engages in the evil practice of bullying citizens, or that some people are exploiting the emotions of the crowd for their own private gain, with the aim of delaying the proceedings of this case. This would betray the original intention of well-meaning citizens who advocate for justice in the Zhang case. I have instructed the courts under my jurisdiction that anyone who disturbs the court will be prosecuted for obstructing official business. I hope everyone will take note of this. The defendants were then remanded into custody after another hearing at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Letter to French Consul-General to Abide by Agreement</p>
<p>The Special Second Court jointly sent a letter yesterday to the French Consul-General and the Municipal Council, as well as the Judicial Administration Office, stating: "It is clearly stipulated in Article 6 of the agreement that arrested persons in the French Concession should be handed over to the court within 24 hours, and those not handed over within the time limit should be released. This should be jointly observed to comply with the law. However, it is regrettable that the French Concession police station has sometimes violated this provision. For example, in the case of Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong, apprentices at the Chengji Tile and Shirt Factory at No. 292 Caishi Road, who were detained on April 29 of this year on suspicion of misappropriating lost property, the police not only failed to transfer them to this court in accordance with the agreement, but also allowed the detectives in charge of the case to use torture to extract confessions, ultimately resulting in a tragic death. Such disregard for national dignity, trampling on people's lives, and harming diplomatic relations, who will be held responsible? This court, in its capacity as the judicial authority responsible for protecting human rights, has already lodged a protest. We request that your consulate immediately instruct the police department to refrain from using torture on arrested persons in the concession, regardless of the seriousness of the crime. They must comply with the agreement and hand them over to the court within 24 hours. If any further incidents of exceeding the time limit occur, this court will exercise its authority to summon them for interrogation in order to uphold the law and protect civil rights."</p>
<p>French Police File Public Prosecution</p>
<p>According to the latest news from the Central News Agency, the Judicial Office of the French Concession Police has filed a public prosecution against all six defendants, charging them with fraud, false accusation, and incitement to false accusation. The Special Second Court briefly questioned each defendant based on the charges. Due to the complexity of the case, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. As for the six defendants, except for Wang Qing and Chao Lengfan, who are under the custody of the French Concession Police, the remaining defendants have been transferred to the court's detention center. Guo Shiyuan, due to the severity of his crimes, has been placed in shackles to prevent escape and as a sign of caution.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Conversations with Two Advisors <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, Mr. Masuta Kimura, Advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, hosted a press conference and stated that "to stabilize people's livelihood, it is necessary to first stabilize the currency. To stabilize the currency, it is necessary to strengthen the content of the Central Reserve Bank. To strengthen the content of the Central Reserve Bank, it is necessary to ensure that the reserve funds of the Central Reserve Bank notes are sufficient, and to be cautious about easing credit to all parties. The Central Reserve Bank is now moving in this direction, and the people can rest assured."</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, Mr. Taro Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, hosted a press conference in Shanghai and stated that "the current hoarding incident should be thoroughly cracked down upon, and the fundamental cause of this speculation and hoarding is related to the currency issue. Therefore, consideration should be given to tightening the currency, and policies such as issuing lottery tickets, prize-linked savings, and food coupons, which have been under consideration, are gradually moving towards the implementation stage and can be realized soon... As for the price issue... the fundamental policy is to adhere to price controls; however, this policy should also be implemented in consideration of the actual situation in China. To promote the stability of the financial sector, it is necessary to strictly crack down on the inflow of funds into unproductive areas and the speculation of funds; therefore, small and weak financial institutions should be reorganized and merged."</p>
<p>The words of the two advisors carry great weight. We believe that their words will be followed by action, or perhaps we can even believe that they speak only after preparing to act or deciding to act. The evolution of world affairs often hinges on psychology. The current soaring prices and widespread hoarding are mainly due to public panic. The two advisors have been able to discern the crux of the problem and have resolutely expressed their determination to tighten the currency, stabilize prices, and stabilize the financial sector. This will undoubtedly help to stabilize people's hearts and dispel panic.</p>

Therefore, the stock companies requested registration with the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau in accordance with the measures for cracking down on the operation of Chinese stock companies, and Yongchang, Wufu, and 13 other companies have been approved and issued business licenses. It is learned that the Economic Bureau has reviewed the registration applications of the stock companies one by one in accordance with the law, and will issue licenses to qualified companies at any time. It is reported that the 15 stock companies that have obtained licenses are preparing to resume business, and trading will generally be restored by next week at the latest. The transactions after the resumption of business will be strictly supervised by the competent authority, but speculative trading will be absolutely prohibited.</p>

<p>Since the autumn of the year before last, silk factories in Shanghai have stopped silk production one after another due to the depletion of silkworm cocoon raw materials and the lack of sources. It is learned that this year's spring cocoons will be launched and seen new this month, and the authorities will not include silkworm silk materials in the scope of control. Therefore, in order to seek the revival of China's silkworm silk industry, various silk factories have now sent personnel to the production area in the interior to contact cocoon shops to purchase cocoons in order to transport the purchased spring cocoons to Shanghai to start silk production. It is learned that the Silk Construction Special Donation Office of the Ministry of Finance of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions has started to handle the registration of silk factories since yesterday in order to uniformly manage them, as various silk factories are preparing to resume work.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Strengthening the National Government and the Hoarding Problem (4) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>China's national capital has a deeper history and strength than the native national capital, and its development is very possible. To restrain the activities of industrial capital, state power and state capital are absolutely necessary. Therefore, Chairman Wang mentioned this issue in the New Movement Outline:</p>
<p>"Why couldn't we implement the Principle of People's Livelihood in the past? This is because we have not sufficiently promoted the development of national capital. From now on, we attach importance to this point and must enable national capital to develop, naturally suppressing individual capital."</p>
<p>The relationship between the state and capital, capital and people's livelihood is very clearly stated in Chairman Wang's instructions. The current national capital of the National Government, first, is the National Government capital of the Sino-Japanese joint venture state-owned enterprise. These important enterprises all have the nature of national capital. The cooperation between Japanese capital and the National Government's national capital is of great significance. Its profit is extremely different compared with the 50 times and 100 times exorbitant profits of Chinese commercial capital. The future handling of state-owned enterprises is the trend of wartime capital. What the Japanese people sincerely hope from the National Government is to ask the National Government to study the direction of activities of national capital. Although we are Japanese, we are very clear about the following actual situation: The main national capital in the state-owned enterprises is current investment, and the activities of national capital have not yet been fully developed. However, in addition to state-owned enterprises, there are also the Central Reserve Bank and other parts of national capital. However, in order to strongly promote policies to deal with production, materials, hoarding, etc., and to obtain the foundation of political power, the National Government's national capital really needs to be strengthened again. However, at this time, it is still necessary to review the relationship between a kind of national capital and bureaucratic capital in China. For example, Chiang Kai-shek relied on the so-called Zhejiang financial cliques, colluded with bureaucratic capital and even warlord capital, and attempted to strengthen the warlords' national capital to strengthen his "resistance-based foundation." In China, where the power of national capital is weak, bureaucratic capital that controls state power has emerged. Bureaucratic capital and a part of the native capital form a faction. Bureaucratic capital expands itself through cooperation with native national capital. The native national capital also strengthens itself by combining with bureaucratic capital. The fact that it hinders the normal development of national capital has been seen repeatedly in Chinese history. The misfortune of China is really no greater than this.</p>
<p>Under the rule of the National Government, which shares the great cause of the Greater East Asia War with Japan, it is hoped that such facts will no longer exist, and it is believed that they will not exist. In short, the bureaucratization of national capital and the compradorization of national capital are not acceptable for the proper development of the new China.

<h3 id="e53">Concerning Another Thorough Investigation of Illegal Hoarding: A Reporter from the Continental Daily News Interviews the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Hoarding Major Commodities" have been promulgated for a week. To ensure its full implementation, all parties unanimously hope that the authorities will send a second team of investigators. The Chinese newspapers on the 10th published a Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency on the 9th, stating: "It has been decided to dispatch a second investigation team. The core of the investigation team is the Ministry of Industry. To maintain the authority of the law and eliminate speculation, the National Government is determined to prosecute criminal behavior." It is remembered that the names of the first team of investigators were announced by the National Government. Now, to reassure the public, it is also necessary to announce the list of the second team of investigators. However, the dispatch date and names of the investigators are shrouded in secrecy. This unclear attitude will have a significant impact on strengthening the National Government's image in the future. Our newspaper specifically inquired about this matter at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry. According to them, the second investigation team has not yet been dispatched. The questions and answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Question: According to a Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency on the 9th, the second investigation team has been dispatched, but the specific details have not been clarified. Who will be responsible for the investigation, and when will they be dispatched?</p>
<p>Answer: We have not heard anything about the dispatch of a second investigation team. Director Yuan came to Shanghai on business a few days ago and did not mention the dispatch of a second investigation team.</p>
<p>Question: Will the Ministry of Industry be at the center of the second investigation?</p>
<p>Answer: This office has not received any instructions on this matter. The members of the first investigation team were the Deputy Minister of Finance, the Director of the Ministry of Industry, the Supervisor of the Business Management Council, and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. There has been no mention of any changes to this arrangement.</p>
<p>Question: The citizens of Shanghai unanimously hope that another team of investigators will be sent to conduct a thorough investigation. Does your office believe there is a need to dispatch them as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Answer: The investigators are dispatched by the National Government. This office can only follow the decisions of the National Government. As for whether it is necessary, your reporter can consider it for themselves.</p>
<p>Question: It is generally said that the first investigation was influenced by factional politics and its continued investigation work was affected, ending after only three days. It is believed that the second investigation will have a longer duration. What does your office think?</p>
<p>Answer: After the first investigation, various agencies in Shanghai are still continuing their investigations. The public opinion advocating that the second investigation should be carried out for a long time is already very clear.</p>
<p>Question: Dealing with the issue of hoarding is an important task. To facilitate the resolution of this matter, is it necessary to establish a joint committee between the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Council? What do you think?</p>
<p>Answer: We deeply feel the need for close coordination between various agencies, but we have no knowledge of whether a joint committee will be established in the future.</p>
<p>Question: Most people believe that to solve the problem of hoarding, a national movement must be launched. Does the National Government have such intentions?</p>
<p>Answer: This office has not heard anything about this issue.</p>
<p>Question: What is the impact of the hoarding crime regulations promulgated this time?</p>
<p>Answer: The general public, such as buying and storing for household use, is not the target of the crime regulations. Therefore, from the perspective of the people's livelihood, the public absolutely welcomes this move by the National Government. However, hoarders inevitably complain that this law is too strict. However, if hoarding can be eradicated, there will be no problem. Why not wash your hands of hoarding activities at this time and realize the truth?

<h3 id="e54">People Dissatisfied with Reality <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Fei</p>
<p>All those who are dissatisfied with reality cannot escape two trends: "advancement" and "degeneration." To put it plainly, there is a type of person who, because of their dissatisfaction with the existing environment, is inspired to strive and constantly improve themselves, spurring themselves on to fight against adverse circumstances and strive for a bright future. Another type of person, although dissatisfied with the existing environment, does not have the determination to fight it. They only know how to complain emptily or fantasize in their minds about beautiful dreams of a new environment. There is also a type of person who, because of dissatisfaction with reality, becomes pessimistic and seeks out meaningless stimulation, resulting in great damage to their spirit and body. Among these three types of people, only the first type is advancing. The other two types are all on the path to degeneration, differing only in degree.</p>
<p>When a country is unstable and society is uneasy, the general situation is difficult to satisfy people, especially young people. They are full of youthful vitality, boiling passion, and noble will. Before being tainted by sin, they are as unrestrained as wild horses. Therefore, they all express dissatisfaction with the current situation.</p>
<p>People who are dissatisfied with the existing environment have a hopeful future. However, we should pay attention to the fact that dissatisfaction with the existing situation is not just a few complaints or empty slogans. We must be determined, enrich our knowledge and skills, hone our will, seize the opportunity, and fight fiercely against the environment in order to achieve victory. If dissatisfaction with reality is only empty complaints and slogans, without making efforts to strive, not only will there be no hope of advancement, but there is also a danger of nearing degeneration. As for actions that are passive and decadent due to dissatisfaction with the current situation, they are absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Those who have no direction in their hearts, whose will is not firm, and who are swayed by the environment have no hope. Those who are good at talking big but are insubstantial are the most dangerous. Only those who have a strong will and work hard practically will have a promising and hopeful future! We are dissatisfied with reality, but at the same time, we must have the determination to strive. Then, the bright path will be in front of us!</p>
<h3 id="e55">"Life" and "Environment" <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>From the moment anyone is born, they are growing in an "environment" all the time, until their heart stops beating and their blood stops circulating, only then can they break away from it. Therefore, "life" and "environment" are like trees and land, they cannot be separated for even a moment; once separated, they cannot grow.</p>
<p>Since "environment" is in constant contact with "life" and cannot be separated for even a moment, wouldn't the comfort or discomfort of the "environment" have a close relationship with "life"?</p>
<p>On the surface, a "comfortable" "environment" can make "life" feel "comfortable" and "happy"; it seems to be the best environment in the world. However, if we observe further, what it gives to "life" is not benefit, but harm. A glance is enough to see where "life" becomes "extravagant" because of "comfort" and "lazy" because of "happiness"? As a result, "life" inevitably embarks on the path of "degeneration" and is eliminated by nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a "deficient" "environment," judging from the literal meaning, seems to give "life" "pain" and "hardship," which should be a major obstacle to "life's" "happiness." However, if we look at it from another perspective, aren't there many promising young people who pursue a "happy" "life" because they feel the "pain" of "life"? Because they suffer the "hardship" of "life," they realize that their skills are not enough and strive to study? ... As a result, one by one they succeed, making the world more "civilized" and more "splendid"...</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although a "comfortable" "environment" can make "life" feel "happy" and "comfortable," it makes "life's" will depressed and easily leads to a path of decline, whereas a "deficient" "environment" does not. Looking from ancient times to the present, which inventor or great person was not born in a "deficient" "environment"? And all of them succeeded through constant "hardship." Therefore:</p>
<p>A "comfortable" "environment" is like a "poison" pill coated with "sugar"; while a "deficient" "environment" is a "tonic" pill with a "bitter" taste.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Knowledge <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>Knowledge is the rudder of our lives, it enables us to distinguish between truth and falsehood; it always upholds justice and truth, to defeat the instigation of the black demons; therefore, Bacon said, "Knowledge is power, and power is knowledge."</p>
<p>People in the world, regardless of poverty or wealth, all have the right to acquire knowledge, because knowledge is selfless, its bestowal is not limited by class or country, as long as you strive to pursue it, you will get results.</p>
<p>"One point of effort, one point of harvest." We should not be satisfied with knowledge just because we have achieved some success.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the authority in the world, it transcends everything else.</p>
<p>Knowledge is an inexhaustible source of wealth, also like a bottomless ocean, never ending.</p>
<p>Knowledge is a golden ladder, it can enable us to reach the realm of ideal beauty and goodness; therefore, knowledge can satisfy our desires, and it can make us great.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Greed <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Yi</p>
<p>For the sake of greed, I don't know how many lives have been harmed. Greed certainly has a big and small distinction, but the lack of satisfaction is the same. In order to make up for the inner inadequacy and desires, sin is produced. Sin is certainly unwanted, but for the sake of poverty, people often touch it.</p>
<p>Poultry, fish, meat and vegetables can be used for supplementation and deliciousness. Why do you try to taste the freshness of one flavor and eat puffer fish? A plain life can be waited for a long time. Why do you try to be rich and glorious? The occurrence of these problems is due to not knowing enough. For the sake of not knowing enough, I want to speculate on the skill of not working hard, and as a result, I fall into a trap. At that time, it is too late to regret it. The heavy one loses his life, and the light one loses his fortune. Isn't this self-seeking suffering?</p>
<p>At present, the people's life is difficult for everyone to understand and every household knows it. What's more, you are one person and one family like this. In order to adapt to this environment, the most exquisite greedy people think of ways to set up everywhere, such as gambling dens are lined up, and pawnshops are crowded. At the beginning, the abundance of money led the gamblers to go deep into the situation. As a result, there is no winner in a hundred bets. If you catch the collar, you will be stretched, and you will get nowhere to go. Gamblers are not only alone, but everyone is the same. In the end, the light won. If the greedy people can understand this and take self-satisfaction as the goal, the future environment will be beautiful. Greedy people, turn back quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e58">Laughter <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>"Laughter" is an expression of a happy heart. It can even be said that it is beneficial to the human body. You must have heard many hygienists say: "Being able to laugh three times a day can improve health." We believe that "laughter" is beneficial.</p>
<p>However, there are too many types of "laughter," therefore, "laughter" also has good and bad distinctions.</p>
<p>However, in my eyes:</p>
<p>The sarcastic laughter, disdainful laughter, and mockery laughter of friends...</p>
<p>There are also the greedy laughter of unscrupulous merchants manipulating hoarding and making a fortune, and the flattering laughter of playing with women...</p>
<p>I see even more, different forms of laughter...</p>
<p>Therefore, I hate these; cunning and treacherous laughter, flattering laughter, sarcastic and teasing laughter... These kinds of laughter are despicable, and "laughter" hides a dagger.</p>
<p>And we need these: the innocent laughter of children, the pure and natural laughter, the humorous and knowing laughter, the sincere laughter of mothers.</p>

<h3 id="e60">The Current Crisis in the Theater Movement <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Diao Ge</p>
<p>Today's development of the theater scene cannot but be said to be in a state of booming, flourishing, and striving for a wide audience; however, is this booming, this flourishing, and this striving normal, proper, or is it deformed, means-oriented, and abnormal? I think it should be the latter.</p>
<p>Because the development of the theater scene is deformed, means-oriented, and abnormal; therefore, I, from the standpoint of a person who loves drama, put forward the following points of what I consider to be "crises" as materials for advanced experts to discuss.</p>
<p>One, In terms of scripts</p>
<p>A, Content: Mr. Meng Lang once pointed out in "White Mao" that today's dramas are "complex in plot, lively in drama," and the performances are "miscellaneous," catering to the psychology of the audience in every possible way... These have already been discussed, and I will not repeat them.</p>
<p>B, Form: I am absolutely not opposed to any new form of experimentation; however, I am opposed to a kind of self-promotion using the beautiful name of a new form, selling wild human heads, and deceiving the audience.</p>
<p>C, Source of stories: Since the incident, adapted plays are everywhere, and original creations can be said to be "rare products." Regarding this point, my opinion is as follows: (1) Adaptation is fine, but it must never be regarded as the main source of scripts; the main source should still be original scripts. (2) In the method of adaptation, we must overthrow the method of changing Zhang San when we see Han, changing to So-and-so Little Bitch when we see Mary, then deleting some lines and adding some gimmicks. (3) The content of the adapted play must conform to reality, the distance to the audience should be as close as possible, and there must be a correct theme.</p>
<p>D, The writer's problem: Because there are many performances and few works, there is a phenomenon of crude production; to remedy this point is to excavate new talents, of course, we must treat the works of "new people" with a different eye.</p>
<p>Two, In terms of actors</p>
<p>A, System problems: The theory of the AB system should be supported, it can enable actors to learn from each other, discover new talents, and help the performance; but in fact, there is a real need to improve in the face of open and secret struggles. I am also opposed to the existence of the star system. Here, I hope that those engaged in the theater movement will pay attention to the fact that it is possible to levy a performance tax, but that kind of system of drawing nine thousandths from the "protagonist" (?) and drawing zero thousandths from the "extra" is completely going the way of the star system.</p>
<p>B, Acting skills: In the current theater scene, some actors' acting skills give a feeling of reaching the peak and surpassing the limit, but this is ultimately a minority! The majority of actors are still stagnant at a certain point. The reason for this is that I think it is due to a lack of seriousness; those who go on stage to sing two sentences, go off stage to chat and laugh, and only know to revolve in the circle of the two sexes, are countless, how can such people talk about "seriousness," how can they talk about progress, what else is there but stagnation?</p>
<p>C, Poaching problem: Now, as long as the treatment of Group A is better than Group B, they will immediately belong to the command of Group A. If Group B offers a higher treatment than Group A, then he or she will immediately belong to the actor of Group B; of course, in today's rising cost of living, who does not hope to get more income; however, in this evolution of the situation, actors have invisibly become commodities of auctioneers, auctioneers, theater groups, seem to be enemies to each other, incompatible; to remedy the method, of course, "unification" is the best, but it is also not easy to see in fact; I think, it is better for theater groups to decide on "market prices" with each other.</p>
<p>D, Health problems: This point can be seen in the news: "Bai Hong is sick!" "Shen Min is sick," "Yingzi suffers from lung disease," "Shi [blank] fainted," "Sun Jinglu fainted"... These seem to be also related to the morbid development of the theater scene, the actor's illness, of course, there are many reasons, but it is not without reason for overwork, that is, for a long time performance of a play, and then immediately go to play B play after A play is performed; rehearsal new play in the morning, playing a play in the afternoon, busy without rest is very related.</p>
<p>Three, In terms of theater criticism:</p>
<p>A, Form: The form of theater criticism has now almost become a formula: starting with telling the story, and then either adding some "story comments" or immediately following with "commenting" on the actors: Zhang San is "still good," Li Si is "making progress," this person "succeeded," that person "failed," and finally adding something like the lighting is okay, the costumes are okay, and it ends hastily. I think in the future, it is better for newspaper supplements to become a kind of table for "theater critics" to fill in, which would be more concise.</p>
<p>B, Content: There are now three factions of theater critics in Shanghai: one is the "Mr. Nice Guy" faction, he only points out the advantages of the play, but does not point out the shortcomings, he does not dare to offend people. The second type is the "heroism" faction, they desperately look for the shortcomings of the performance and nitpick. The third type, which is extremely rare, are theater critics with a serious attitude, more objective than subjective, using a calm mind to analyze the facts and criticize the performance calmly, but I dare say that there are not a few such people throughout Shanghai, and there is also a type of abusive, nothing to take. In short, what we need is the third party, we hope that the first and second types can gradually become normal, and even put out those abusive theater critics. And recognize new works.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Citizen Relocation Information <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Liangxin</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Baojia system in the Public Concession, residents must have a relocation certificate to move, but after most citizens move to a new residence, they often think that once the application for relocation procedures is completed, the household registration and food ration certificates will be transferred by the police station Baojia office. By the time it is delayed, it has not yet been obtained, or even several periods of collection have been missed, which is inexplicable. This kind of situation is often heard. However, it is not known that the Baojia office and the food distribution office are two organizations, which are not related to each other. Citizens who have moved should borrow the latest house rent ticket from the householder (second landlord) after moving in, as well as the reported household registration relocation certificate, and apply to the food distribution office in the area, and bring the filled application form, and ask the Bao chief to affix the official (the Bao chief's seal) private seal to prove it. Then go to the food distribution office to collect the rice certificate. I would like to publicize the procedures to the citizens, so that those who have not obtained the household registration and food ration certificates due to relocation will know what to do.</p>

<p>Layman Li Shenyan is inherently kind, likes to do good deeds and give alms. The other day, he voluntarily entrusted this newspaper with 2,000 yuan from his birthday banquet to be distributed to charity organizations, as a blessing for relatives and friends. In addition to 500 yuan being transferred to the education fund, 500 yuan was distributed to Pushen Hall, Pude Association, Puyuan Hall, Pushen Mountain Villa, and the Chinese Education Morality Association, and 1,000 yuan was distributed to the Disaster Children's Education Center, the Ciyou Education Institute, the Christian Orphans' Education Institute, the Bethel Orphanage, the Immanuel Orphanage, the Bethany Orphanage, the Paradise Labor Nursery, the Deaf and Mute School, the Girls' Volunteer Night School, and the Buddhist Infant Protection Institute. Mr. Hu Wanchun also sent a letter saying: I have spent half a century in vain and have achieved nothing. Yesterday was my birthday, but I did not intend to celebrate it. However, I am grateful for the kindness of my relatives and friends, who held a banquet in public. It is difficult to refuse such sincerity, and I am ashamed to accept it. But I still feel uneasy in my heart, so I sent 1,000 yuan from the refund of the banquet to your newspaper's primary school teacher medical aid fund, which may be understood by my relatives and friends as a slight expression of my gratitude. The money has been received, thank you.</p>
