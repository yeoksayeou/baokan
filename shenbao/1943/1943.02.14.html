<p>社評</p>
<h3>國民經濟動員</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會爲商討戰時經濟政策，召開第一次全國經濟會議，已於十二日在京揭幕，本報會於先一日著論敬獻愚見。預料這次會議，必能對於我國戰時經濟，一切施策，有必要的建樹。我國目前經濟，經緯萬端，特別是在目前，正可說是生死存亡的嚴重關頭，政府當局固然要愼重商討，求萬全的政業和辦法。民間經濟界更必須嚴密注意目前時局，努力向革新與健全國民經濟的前途邁進。在這一理想之下，單靠政府當局的努力是不够的，一定需要社會力量的協同，在國策的指導下，動員全國國民經濟的力量，完成長期戰鬥的態　。一面以國民經濟力量來保障國策的順利完成，一面以國策來領導國民經濟走上革新健全的路。</p>
<p>首先，我們希望於政府當局者，爲實現全國國民經濟力量的集中，作計劃性的統一性的合理運用。（一）必須先行普遍和澈底的調整和健全各級政治機構，對各種產業部門，實行戰時編制。對企業及民間經濟團體，予以協助與指導，嚴密其組織，增强其力量。（二）必須使一切經濟部門都在同一目標下齊一步驟，共同行動，一致確實奉行，絕不使有某一部門或某一地區有遲滯之事，而妨害共他部門或其他地區，終至於影響全局。（三）基層組織及基層工作，尤須加以調整；特別是要先就各地經濟實情，供需狀况，予以合理支配。如關於資源之管制，一面有效的管理生產，一面統制勞働力，同時對於靜的資源，切實調查，普遍登記，而對於動的資源，以不妨碍貨暢其流的原则，切實管理市塲穩定物價。（四）物價日漲，影響軍需民生太巨，平價工作，自應日求增進。政府還可使主管物資機關策劃以實物供應要機關爲原則，如軍用公用及生產機關所需原料，都應在可能範圍內，設法供給。而今後政府預算的編成及生產成本約計算，亦應依實物供給的原則規定。（五）在「總力參戰」目標之下，應該業勵輿論，指導社會，增進精神總動員之效率，使舉國上下，了解參戰之眞義，認淸本身之義務，共策進行，由經濟動員而達成「總力動員」。</p>
<p>其次，我們希望於民間經濟界界——金融界和實業界者：第一，在這非常時期，應該認識我闕家所處之地位，認識我國民經濟四周的環境，適應時代的趨勢和需要，確定經濟界對國策協力和上下協力發展國民經濟的方針。在這裏我們特別要認淸，經濟界（不論爲金融或爲產業）如果沒有一個强力的政府作統一性約計劃性的指導與管制，放任民間爲無政府的自由發展，那麼，中國經濟前途的危險是不堪設想的。同樣的，政府的國策及其動員計劃與統制管理業務，如果得不到民間的自願的協力，那麼國策計劃及其執行業務，也就決不能收到理想的效果。所以，今後政府與民間經濟界協力，尤須更進一步的密切表現。第二，無可諱言的，目前各工廠在生產上完全是無計劃無秩序的，簡易而利厚者，則趨之若騖，艱難而利薄者，則畏縮不前。最嚴重的，還是一部份生產表現爲重複，或浪費；另一部分則往往由於無人問津而形成物資的缺乏。這種現象，隨着時局的發展，國家的管制也必然就會實行的，與其被動的受制，何不及早目覺，共謀分工合作，實行有計劃的生產。因此，產業界相互間的合作，是更感迫切需要了。第三，過去金融界是各自爲政，今後應該以更遠大的目光，和正確的認識，實踐金融界的戰時使命，集中力量於協助政府調劑財政，增進生產。</p>
<p>國民經濟的動員，還必須一般國民的協力，我們要認識參戰的意義，要認識從參戰以後，我們必須過戰時的生活。我們過去的確已吃了戰爭的苦痛，但這個苦痛，絕對不够償付勝利應有的代價。從今日起，我們才遇到眞正的試騐。我們無疑的，要在試騐中獲得成功。我們要爲目前的痛苦而忍耐，我們要對目前享樂表示鄙棄。我們要獻出一切　的靜的力量，來參加總力戰。</p>

<h3>所望於全國經濟委員會者</h3>
<p>全國　　委員會第一次全體會議，自十二日起在南京開會，從事審議戰時經濟諸政策。　　生　之具體方針、經濟機構之改革，節約物資並促進物資交流等，均將於今後會議中加以討論。對此會議之　　，吾人寄與極重大的關心。</p>
<p>進行中，中國方面之主要任務、厥在於經濟，尤以物資之增產及其動員，　　　　　　　　之　力　助。全國經濟委員會之所以討論生產動力之發展，計劃戰時經濟之推進者，實以此爲中國參戰後之中心問題，而爲今後一切施策之其體的方向，中國參戰之範疇如何，所及於東亞全局之影響如何，均將於該會議中得到解答，是以會議的內容，即在國際的意義上亦極堪注意。</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會網羅各界有力人士，組成和平陣營內最人之統一戰綫，爲完遂戰爭，吾人渴望該會應淸算一切派閥主義的傾向，同時，與各界密切的結合，亦爲必要之條件。全國經濟委員會本身旣可視爲此種結合之表現體，　其圓滑的營運，即直接爲和平陣營內統一的傾向之顯示。至堪重視。假令該委員會在內部事務上帶有消極的傾向，則吾人將大爲失望。</p>
<p>抑有進者，上海財界人士，參加該委員會者，爲數甚多，彼等確懇摯從事於戰時經濟之商討。因而會議結果，對今後民族資本的動向，將有重大影響。政界與財界，南京與上海，亦將經此會議而得以溝通。故全體會議若能始終順利進行，則不僅奠定戰時經濟建設之有力基礎，即對國府强化問題亦將有重大貢獻。戰時經濟確立及國府强化，有賴於該委員會之活用，政府對此應有充分的認識。</p>
<p>吾人密切注視該會議在確立戰時經濟體制，增强生產之具體施策上討論所得之結果，故吾人切望政府方面，委員方面，鑒於該會議意義之重大，應出以愼重態度努力進行此會議。國內國外各方面對此會議均寄與以重大關心。戰爭進行中，中國方面如何，國府能否强化？均視此會議之結果以　判。我人鄭重要求國府及諸委員正視此事實。（翔：譯自二月十三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>日報評論　渝方政局</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　此間讀賣報知今日社論以重慶之打擊爲題、詳述重慶在去年所受之打擊、並指出重慶對英美空口援助之憤懣、大意謂去年度日軍在中國戰綫與渝軍交戰結果、共擊斃渝軍廿六萬零八百零五人、俘虜十二萬四千四百零八人、擊落渝機一百零九架、並鹵獲其他軍火無算、此與前年度戰果相較、則擊斃渝軍數目略有若干减少、但俘虜人數計增加二萬二百十人、足證在此一年內、重慶戰意顯已低下、羅斯福前在致議會咨文中、曾稱蔣介石爲亞洲之英雄、並循例稱讚重慶毫不屈服之抗戰態度、表示決予支援、嗣又見我國與國府簽訂協定交還在華租界及撤廢在華治外法權、　大爲狼狽、立即發出虛空無用之通牒、復在加港會談之結論中準備揮入援助重慶一項、頻對重慶暗送秋波、此種毫無實效之聲明與記錄、在兵器資材食糧種種方面、均陷於窮境之重慶、與其謂毫無價値、毋寗謂足使渝方益感苦惱、渝方亦以彼等之空頭支票屢不兌現、會對美國提出嚴重抗議、重慶之憤懣於此可見一般、反觀我中日關係、自國府參戰以後、在名實雙方均已進入共生同死之階段、如交還租界·撤廢治外法權、我國當即根據約定、着着進行準備、並於本月八日將大東亞戰爭發生以來、被我軍所沒收之在華敵產千餘件、移交國府管理、凡此皆足以裨益國府之發展、今日重慶支配奢不僅爲我亞洲之敵人、且亦爲重慶自身之敵人也、</p>

<h3>甘地絕食第三日　孟加拉議會　要求無條件釋放　並向政府聲明茍有不測　政府當局不能不負其責　印獨立運動發生後六萬餘人被捕</h3>
<p>瑞士京城十三日同盟社電　印度甘地聖雄以七十三歲高齡、絕食以來、昨已第三日、英美方面雖受意不予重視、但印度人方面焦慮情緒正與日俱增、據加爾各答訊、孟加拉議會昨日通過特別動議、要求無條件立即釋放首地、並向印度政府聲明、甘地年老力衰苟有不測、政府當局不能不負其責、自由主義派印度要人則已召集名流一百五十人、於下星期叫在馬德里開會討論、至於甘地狀况、據侍醫二人於昨晨檢查後報告稱尚屬良好、甘地現已停止日常散步、此外、據路透社倫敦訊、倫敦報紙均重視邱吉爾首相在下議院之軍事報告、甘地絕食消息、僅登一格地位、又據路透社華盛頓訊、美國人幾未注意及之、</p>

<h3>日軍統治下　昭南島新氣象　秩序恢復市面已趨繁榮　政治經濟各方均有急轉</h3>
<p>昭南十三日中央社電　新嘉坡陷落以來瞬已一載、回憶客歲二月十五日該地陷落之際、市內紊亂已達極點、其時數萬敵軍旣失統帥、復無歸趨、乃相率拋甲棄兵、徬徨市內、商店亦悉數停業、石油槽內火光燭天、奇奧　鼻、水電油煤氣等設傭亦悉遭徹底破壞、民心惶惶不可終日、景象至爲悽慘、日軍佔領後、卽肅淸市內不逞份子、以安善良、使動亂中之新嘉坡治安迅速恢復、繼續修復水電、以利市民、市內商店漸次復業、避難居民亦絡續歸來、至此繁榮狀況已遠非戰前可及、此間人口戰前號稱七十六萬、大東亞戰爭勃發後、馬來各地居民紛至此間避難、故當日軍佔領之際、人口總數已在一百萬以上、此間儲藏物資極爲豐富、食糧尤多、前雖一度發現惡疫、但經日衛生當局之努力防止、瞬即撲滅、及至三月上旬、前任內務次官大達茂雄氏就任首任昭南市長、軍政顧問砂田重政氏及德川義親候爵等、亦相繼蒞臨推行政治、積極建設、一切俱呈飛躍之進展、日語亦普遍市內矗立於市中心區之拉佛爾斯銅像、原爲新嘉坡名勝之一、現已拆除運至博物館內保存、其傍之大運動塲、戰前爲英人所獨佔者、現已開放作當地居民鍛鍊體格之所、每日華僑及印度馬來靑年均欣然集此作足球之戲、居住於馬來及蘇門答臘者、近已聯合組織鍛鍊團體、興南奉公會、最近即將成立、馬來半島原爲人種展覽所、居民種族極繁、現其主要者爲華僑印度人馬來人以及混血歐亞種族、華僑中多閩粵籍、印人中亦分右米爾埃及錫克族等、各民族之風俗習慣旣不相同、生活語言亦各異、英政府歷來即利用此種缺點、大事壓榨、百年以來、各民族飽受凌辱、備嘗艱辛、即宗敎言語等亦受其影響至鉅、英人於此濫作戚福、以致樂不思蜀、以此間爲第二故鄉者、大有人在、然而大東亞戰爭爆發後、英人誇稱爲東方直布羅陀之新嘉坡、於去年二月十五日即爲日軍一鼓佔領、至此居民覺悟唯有日本始足以指導馬來、於過去一年間之政治經濟生活各方面、均有急轉、當地居民均協力當局建設、尤以於馬來五百五十萬人口中約佔半數之華僑、協力更爲積極、戰前馬來及新嘉坡華僑援渝之款、達數萬萬元之鉅、爲前方重要之輸血路、但自新嘉坡陷落後、華僑悉已認淸現勢、深覺過去之非、乃轉而協力日本建設新生馬來、未幾昭南華僑協會成立、於前厦門大學校長林文慶博士領導之下、展開五千萬元獻余運動、作實際協力其後軍政監部財務部發行百萬元獎券時、復經銷大半、在在顯示協力熱誠、當日軍佔領新嘉坡後、一度停業華僑銀行、因軍政當局及日方銀行之好意、而於四月二十八日復業、五月一日起、民船亦恢復自由航行、華僑於經濟方面之活動已悉復舊觀、旦進而以華僑協會爲中心、積極協力、當局從事推進社會公益事業、首於九月二十日起辦理失業華僑登記、設法介紹職業、同時協力當局疏散人口政策、謀根本解決失業問題、於昭南市外建築平民村、約可容納一千戶、並擴充孤兒院、熱心從事敬老懷幼社會事業、凡屬有關社會公益事業、無不踴躍以赴、馬來全體華僑現已完全認識中日提携之眞意、對於協力重建新生之昭南已獲得偉大成果、</p>
<h3>英國喜斯中將論日戰勝要素</h3>

<h3>德經濟部長　發表演說</h3>
<p>柏林十二日哈瓦斯社電　經濟部長芬克、本日在此間德國銀行、發表重要演說、</p>
<h3>世界戰局概觀</h3>
<p>（東京電話）英美今正瘋在宣傳反攻軸心國，在現階段世界戰爭上，英美陣營絕對未佔優勢，所羅門方面，日軍正含辛茹苦，對美軍加以痛擊，德軍之爲增加其春季攻勢力量而放棄斯達林格勒。英美陣營囂然播送英美反攻成功之消息，却正有利於軸心。宣傳政策爲缺乏實力所取的手段，東亞戰錢上業已確立必勝態勢之日本，歐洲方面業已立定脚跟之德國—軸心國今保持沉默。但此爲向勝利邁進過程中增强實力的沉寂。茲試窺測今後軸心國進軍之步驟。</p>
<p>所羅門羣島戰綫</p>
<p>據九日大本營發表，在所羅門方面，日軍爲避免無益犧牲，確保優勢的戰略根據地而轉進，在敵制空權下與擁有數倍於我的美國大軍力戰，而與以重大打擊。此爲構築戰略優勢的後方陣地的前綫掩護部隊。因此，將士在空前惡劣條件下，在補給困難之敵陣中，完成其任務。頃已轉進終了，日本現已重整戰略優勢之姿態。</p>
<p>西南太平洋戰綫之重要，毫不較遜於共他戰綫。日軍今正强化其困難之補給錢，增加航空勢力，今後的新陣綫，値得吾人刮目相視，在此期間所給與敵軍之損書，除九日大本營發表者外，自第一次所羅門海戰迄最近之倫納爾島大海戰，以及海軍航空機在伊薩倍爾島南面的活躍，共擊沉擊破艦艇百十四隻，飛機逮九百九十六架以上。艦艇中戰艦擊沉六隻，擊破四隻，航空母艦擊沉四隻，擊破四隻，美國全艦隊主力的百分之六十，化爲南太平洋中之藻屑，因艦隊之擊滅，美軍之人的喪失，亦在數萬以上。</p>
<p>此一戰果，使澳洲覺醒，美國國內輿論，亦羣起攻擊政府，誘發戰爭的元兇羅斯福，無論其如何宣傳英美陣營的優越，對此數字，亦不得不默然無聲。敵航空勢力在所羅門方面之悠久苦戰中亦佔優勢，但日軍常用劣勢粉碎敵的反攻企圖，日軍陸軍機現已增强，並佔有戰略據點，因無陸上海上有力的航空勢力的掩護，故不能自由活躍，今在該方面的制空地位，業已替換，故今後的活躍，可拭目以待。</p>
<p>阿留申群島戰綫</p>
<p>酷寒與白雪籠罩中的阿留申的涯，熱田，鳴神諸孤島，今亦平靜無事。美國正策動奪取空襲日本本土距離最短的兩島，此爲無可隱諱的事實。至五六月間冰消雪溶，氣候轉好時，應予警戒。美國積極實施强化阿拉斯加的施策，除阿拉斯加航路外，並敷設新鐵路自柯拉期加至阿留申各要地，敵已建成堅固的根據地及航空基地　美國計劃奪取熱田，鳴神二島，使白林海峽航路復歸安全，開闢援蘇援蔣戰綫，並企區空襲日本本土。在數十公里外，補給困難的突出孤島上，日本將士正支禦敵軍之襲擊。</p>
<p>大陸—中國戰綫</p>
<p>從事無意義的抗戰，而被稱爲叛逆者的蔣介石，在日軍不斷壓迫下，苟延殘喘於內地，以英美所宣傳的對日反攻爲唯一希望，重慶政權的姿態？至可悲哀。</p>
<p>在華美空軍的蠢動，經日軍駐華部隊的攻擊，遁走於內地。援蔣路綫的開闢，亦未見何等效果。</p>
<p>在印英美軍企圖奪還緬甸，再開緬甸路綫的呼聲，在日軍銅牆鐵壁的防禦下，徒成幻想。東條首相在議會中，關於緬甸獨立的聲明，愈鞏固緬甸民衆的結合，而刺激印度四億人民的獨立運動。蔣介石渴望開闢自印度貫通中國西北的路綫，迄今未見實現。</p>
<p>現在重慶政權正用最大努力開發西北，即令成功，但蘇聯現不能不專顧德軍的春季攻勢，英美則忙於世界各戰綫的補給，故援蔣物質，能有幾許可以入手，瞭若觀火。所傳蔣介石渡美卽令屬實，究能從英美獲得幾多少補償，狡獪的羅斯福，往往口不應心，獻自身的財產與美國，事實上蔣成爲美國的中國派遣軍總司令官的地位，但蔣治下的無辜民衆，至可哀憐。</p>
<p>一月九日國府參戰，日本即同時交還租界等，對華政策有重大的轉變，此不啻在根未上消滅了重慶方面抗日的口實。重慶方面的要人及靑年顯趨動搖。今後的中國戰局，所存者唯美空軍的蠢動而已。</p>
<p>德蘇戰綫</p>
<p>蘇聯的冬季反攻已奪回了斯達林格勒。德軍飽羅斯元帥麾下的德第六軍及德空軍的高射砲一師，羅馬尼亞軍二師，克羅特軍一聯隊，總計約二十五萬，在紅軍重圍中苦持數月之久，使左右東部戰綫全德軍命運的對蘇反攻作戰有所準備，此種力戰死鬥的精神，値得敬服。</p>
<p>蘇聯此次的冬季反攻，準備周密，與上次的冬季反攻不同。蘇聯犧牲了莫大的戰力消耗，並由於北菲戰局的好轉，英美軍西非登陸等種種原因凑合，才獲得成功，故不能不說是偶然性的事件。蘇聯僅在斯達林格勒的四周　有與　人交鋒的機會，其他地區，德軍爲整理戰錢，迥避紅軍大軍，作預定的退却。</p>
<p>蘇聯甚至已出動預備軍，於斯達林格勒市正面集結大軍九十師共計百萬人，不顧冬季戰的不利消耗，用戰車五十餘輛，一氣突破德軍陣地，可見蘇聯國內的軍需生產力，正異常躍進中。</p>
<p>頓河流域，兩軍依然繼續激戰，其結果尚未能預測，但蘇聯的反攻已達頂點，今後將漸趨衰弱，德軍冬季營綫的決定，大抵將止於德軍春季攻勢據點的附近。</p>
<p>蘇聯所宣傳的目標爲羅斯托夫的奪取，此在冬季戰局中成爲問題，在德軍方面，爲準備今後的攻勢，確保羅斯托夫爲絕對必要的條件。蘇聯此次冬季反攻，雖暫獲成功，但其所付的代價甚大。</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯業已使用了防備德軍春季攻勢的重要的戰略預備軍。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯軍减少其他戰錢的兵，在巨大消耗下强行推進。</p>
<p>（三）喪失了五千餘輛戰車，多數航空機，莫大的兵力。</p>
<p>（四）在補給困難的冬季，更伸長其補給綫。</p>
<p>（五）冬季戰告終，春季戰繼之而來。戰綫須加整理，兵力有移動。</p>
<p>（六）因此無意義的冬季戰，使兵力未獲休養。</p>
<p>故目前的成功，將造成未來春季戰的不利。反之，德軍之失陷斯達林格勒，喪失許多前進據點，正爲極力迥避冬季戰的不利，而用退避戰略，在春季攻勢前，不消耗兵力，使獲得充分休養，不久冬季過去，新銳軍隊配備於重點完成後，德軍爲替斯城飽羅斯元帥以下二十萬人復仇，即將用壓倒的空軍，似怒濤般開百攻勢，未來的春季攻勢，殊堪注日。</p>
<p>北菲戰綫</p>
<p>英美所宣傳的第二戰綫，菲洲上陸作戰並未如願的牽制住德義軍。反使軸心國潛水艦得到很好的食糧。激减中英美船隻噸位，更瀕危殆。英第八軍追擊羅美爾軍終未成功，今羅美爾軍在突尼斯戰綫以破竹之勢南進，與阿尼姆摩下的德軍合流，在突尼斯，比塞爾達加爾安，司法克斯，迦貝結成一條縱綫，鞏固了突尼斯東部海岸錢的重要地帶，對英，美，特戈爾聯軍準備反攻。去夏德軍精銳機械化部隊羅美爾軍，曾追擊英第八軍至埃及，而虎視開羅，亞歷山大利亞，因其補給須通過沙漠，至爲困難，故不得不後退至突尼斯。補給的困難今反輪到英第八軍的頭上，對於羅美爾軍的後退，不僅未與以打擊，今更須時刻防備軸心軍自突尼斯的反攻。</p>
<p>於阿爾及爾，摩洛哥上陸的英美軍，本　併呑突尼斯攻擊義國南部，但德義早已集結重兵於西西里，突尼斯，彭透拉里亞，確保此三角據點，對英美取反攻姿態。突尼斯的完全制覇即在目前，英美軍在北菲上陸，在政治上戰略上都已失敗。史太林憤慨地稱：「英美軍進攻北菲，不能看做第二戰綫」，因此次作戰，使援蘇物資輸送的能力更　低下。</p>
<p>過去加薩勃朗加的食談，也未見蘇聯，重慶參加，史太林，蔣介石都稱之爲無意義的會議。參加會談的人物，雖出以嚴重的態度，但內容空泛，北菲法國叛軍的內鬨仍未平靜，加薩勃朗加的會談，毫無結果可言。（翔：譯自二月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>新幾內亞戰線巡禮　美澳軍喪魂落魄　呻吟於叢林之中</h3>
<p>喀達爾加納爾，新幾內亞方面的叢林中作戰，晝夜併進，已有半載之久。使美澳軍喪魂落胆，據阿根廷京城來電云，美國時事周刋雜誌的新幾內亞戰綫從軍記者，有過下面這橡一篇報　，澈底暴露了美澳軍的戰敗事實。</p>
<p>大約在居亞河畔北方的○○和○○地方左近，濃烟漫天，砲聲不絕，無疑地在激戰中。這裏雖然地處熱帶，陽光逼人，可是在樹木參天的叢林下，祗見草木，永遠也看不見陽光。四面吹來的惡臭，叫人難受，美澳軍在勇猛的日本軍攻擊之下，日夜惡戰抵抗。</p>
<p>血戰周身</p>
<p>塗上了綠色保護色的卡車，一輛一輛的傾覆在道傍，其中有許多受着重傷的美軍，鮮血淋漓，結成了血塊，身上所穿的綠色制服，每一個部是滿身汚泥，變成了灰色，被毒虫咬了滿面腫脹的兵也有，得不　接濟無法戰鬥而形容憔悴的兵也有，患了熱病而不起的也有，這眞是人世活地獄。</p>
<p>日本軍在四周所築的陣地　多，而　　很堅因，　偉的堡壘，到處可以見到，美澳軍就在這草木樹林裏作戰，日本軍非常　敢，用一中隊的兵力，擊破了一大隊的美軍，這樣說起來，日本軍祗要有一大隊的兵力，就能擊破一師的美軍了。</p>
<p>地氣潮濕阻礙行動</p>
<p>這裏的地氣潮濕，假使一不小心失足的話，管叫你泥足深陷，小溝大浜，到處皆是，簡　不能通過。美澳軍在如　困苦艱難中作戰，眞不是容易的事。</p>
<p>而且邀美澳軍的日方陣地，建築得非常巧妙，日本軍的勇敢精神，是値得驚佩的，爲了要突破日本軍的陣地，祗得冒着槍林彈雨進發，然而結果非但沒有成功，反而損兵折將，受了很大的挫折，美澳軍的屍體，遍地累累。</p>
<p>脫離了近代的範圍，到處展開了肉搏戰，構造精巧的近代武器，倒沒有什么大用處，戰鬥的情形，較任何人的預料更激烈，美澳軍遭遇了這樣的激鬥，方始體會到戰爭不是　幹武器，須要有百折不找的苦幹精神才行。（任：譯自二月十三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>誘甘印象</h3>
<p>— 居瑾</p>
<p>最令人注意的一件事，就是甘省老百姓的貧苦。我們坐汽車經過的地方，除了極少的幾處縣城而外，其餘沿途所見，幾乎都是衣衫襤褸面色消瘦的人，年長的還能够穿着粗衣裳，幼小的兒童們，不論男女，裸體的到處可見。我們看到這種景况，心中自是萬分的難過。</p>
<p>究竟爲什麼緣故，甘肅的人民這樣苦呢？據分析，有下面的幾個原因：甘肅老百姓都是靠天吃飯的，但是老天爺實在並不可靠，僥倖下了透雨一年可以豐收，而豐收的結果，也不過七八成年景；但是甘肅因爲天時地利的限制，很少有豐收之年，因此老百姓們從未吃過一年的　飯，飯都吃不飽，那裏還談得到穿衣；因此人民總是在窮苦中過日子，這是一方面的原因。</p>
<p>第二個原因要算是賦稅過重了。在過去軍閥統治時代，更不必講，就拿現在的情形來說，還有待改進。記得有一次記者去見谷正倫，據谷說：甘省有的區域的老百姓，因爲受了賦稅的過重負擔，因爲吃不飽二餐飯，往往拋棄了自己的田園，帶着妻兒老少逃亡出去；這類的故事時常聽到。因此省政當局，現在正在努力設法，如何減少人民的痛苦，如何協助人民增加農產，其中的一項辦法便是貸款與農民，但是因為老百姓沒有受過什么教育，並不能順科的推行。</p>
<p>記者目睹在蘭州回渶之間的情形，記者的印象是，回敎徒都是服從的人，無論做什麼事情，回敎徒沒有一樣不是走在前面的。記者有一次曾和蔡市長閒談，談到回敎徒的情形，蔡大加讚美，他舉例說，當他下令市民拆房子修馬路的時候，惟獨回敎徒首先服從命令，把房屋拆掉，做了極好的榜樣。諸如此類的故事很多，這不過是一件事實而已。寫完了甘肅的現狀後，記者願意說出幾點感想，爲這篇報告做一個結束。</p>
<p>第一，人民的生活太艱苦，當政者應以减少人民的痛苦增加人民的福利，爲施政的要務。</p>
<p>第二，敎育太不發達。甘肅可以說並沒有幾個最高學府，就連中小學校，以及國民學校等，都不够標準，因此普及敎育，是開發西北的急事。</p>
<p>第三，人才太缺乏。人才的缺乏是甘肅省以及西北各省普遍的現象，甘肅以及西北各地待做的工作很多，但是做事的人太少太不够了。這次工程師在蘭州開會，我們在街上看到的標語，如同「工程師們，留在西北吧！」等等，都充分證明西北各省人才的缺乏。如何把各部鬥的人才移到西北擔任開發的工作，這是値得各方面注意的。（三十二年一月十日發）</p>

<p>英報不滿首相言論</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾於十一日在下院演說時、對於德潛艇之威脅、猶作樂觀報告、故似已引起各方之不滿、頃據倫敦來電、十二日英國各報對邱吉爾猶欲在國民之前作掩飾眞相之態度、即大加攻擊、認邱吉爾對應付潛艇之戰術雖表明自　、但德潛艇之活躍依然爲英美最大之威脅、故事態嚴重、顯然未訐樂觀云、</p>
<p>潛艇威脅將益嚴重</p>
<p>里斯本十三日海通社電　據紐約息、美國普拉特海軍上將在「新聞週刊」發表論文、對消除潛艇之威脅、作種種建議、渠稱、加薩勃朗加會議中證實潛艇之威脅、仍極嚴重、自杜尼資海軍上將被任爲德國海軍部長後、潛艇之活動、行將益形加緊、德國現正傾其全力、以截斷協約國海上之交通綫、其中最關重要及最易受潛艇襲擊之路綫、爲美國至北非及通過直布羅陀之航綫、協約國護航錢仕航程中、除賴諸護航軍艦之保護外、並無飛機之保護、故普拉特主張使用飛船以爲保護、</p>
<h3>戰時各國的國民生活觀（一）</h3>
<p>— 石井良一著　靜子譯</p>
<p>德·意·美·英·德</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>德國的食糧情形，已日見好轉。當開戰之後，德國雖然可以說是一手掌握了全歐洲的穀倉，然而因爲她不僅是本國，即所有占領區域的居民食糧，也不能不負責處理，所以他們的食糧分配量，也不得不酌予减少。於是外國的勞働者，波蘭蘇聯等國的俘虜，也都使之從事於農業的生產，以圖增加食糧，國內和東部佔領地的農產，今年出乎意外地豐收，因而有自十月十九日起，增加麵包和肉類配給量的聲明。此外，今年聖誕節，目特別配給，食料作爲饋贈禮品，首先每人每週增加配給的麵包額是二百五十克，當時憑證制度規定的配給額是二千二百五十克，肉類每人每週增加五十克，合計是三百五十克；至於長時間的和夜間的勞働者，較普通人特別增配五十克合計增加一百克，所以一般勞働者，非常喜歡，不過德國在食糧方面，最要緊的問題，還是脂肪類，一般標準消費者，每人每週的白塔油，猪油，麥琪琳，以及食油之類，綜合起來的配給額，不過　二百零六克，較之以前的二百六十九克，已經是减少了。今年因爲增加了種植油指植物　　　，油脂　　　　，或者會增加，　　　　　　　　　　　　　乳酪砂搪，果醬和小麥粉之類，亦已實行配給制，惟麵包用的穀類和馬鈴薯等類原料供應，則非常豐富，尤其是今年馬鈴薯特別豐收，所以每人每週的配給量，決定二千五百克，到小菜店裏去，還可以買到這限量以上的數量。以上所述，都是憑配給證才能買到的。此外如靑菜·水菓·鷄肉·鷄蛋和鮮魚之類，不必憑配給證，也可以買得到，因爲不足的靑菜和水菓，可以山意大利輸入。惟鷄蛋，尤其是在柏林這類的大都市，每個月平均大約是三個到五個之譜。牛乳每個大人，每日可以配給八分之一里特耳（Liter）買牛乳的時候，祗須各人自己到牛奶公司申請購買就行了，但是重勞働者，長時間和夜開勞働者，病人或懷着胎兒或哺乳的母親和小孩子等，則一律配給全需要量。</p>
<p>嗜好品，咖非是配給的，因爲沒有茶，所以完全用代用品，酒類不列入配給制內，可以自由買喝，不過實際上是不够的，因此一般都市裏嗜酒的人們，　跑到消耗酒量比較少的地方去、可是又受了運輸的限止，　　是通融，其實等於零，所以不僅是酒類，　是牛乳，白塔油，麵包，香烟以及其他日常生活品，也須受同樣的限制；　　國亦有如日本購買　隊那樣的擠買情形，因爲德國對於這類物品老早就加以限制了。點心，白糖之類，　爲原料缺乏，大概每人每四　六週之間，不過配給一百二十五克而已。</p>
<p>關於衣料，第三次配給證的點數是一百二十點，較之前次一百五十點减少了二成；配給證的有效期間，多了四個月，前次是一年，這次則延長到十六個月。今年一月起，因爲民需生產品的减少，所以第四次配給點數更縮减到一百點；有效期間爲十八個月，（延長了兩個月）兒童仍舊，三件頭的衣服是八十點，外衣九十點，襪子八點，連領襯衫二十四點，這當然不能說是過分耗費。依照　四次衣料配給點數來說，男子的衣服和服裝類的材料，已减低到需要量以下的數量，故必需另行發給特別配給許可證，男女的冬外衣，並不憑衣料配給證，而是根據特別許可證來配給的。鞋子過去是用特別許可證的，現在則仍用配給證，但是在工塲或從事農業的勞働者，因爲情形不同，故必需較多量的衣料，因此肥皂和作業衣服，採用特別配給制。</p>
<p>至於肥皂；普通人每月配給香皂一小塊，洗滌肥皂二百五十克；二歲以內的幼童，增加上等肥皂一百克，肥皂　五百克；八歲以內的小孩，增加肥皂粉五百克；其他病人，醫生，醫院則特別配給；洗衣店亦有一定的肥皂配給證。皮鞋，每年一雙，因爲是代用品的原故，所以不大耐用，在不得已的時候，祇好買木鞋來穿了。今春以來，香烟也實行配給制度了；成人的，每人每天大約是五六技，這當然不够，吸烟的人們於是多已戒吸，這正與當局的用意相吻合。女子的配給量，祇及男子的一半。</p>
<p>德國人民這樣的生活，可以說是非常緊縮了，然而我們在另一面來看，與其說是物資自身的缺乏，毋寗說是故意置國民日常生活於不足的狀態中，以期爭取長期戰的最後勝利，這或者是政府當局寓有的深意，也未可知；同時這也就是全國國民所深切瞭解的，故絕不作絲毫不平之鳴，因此全國國民的生活能長此保持安定，物價的上昇，自開戰以來，到現在不過漲到百分之五而已。</p>
<p>如節省燃料計，自十一月二日起，復廢止夏季時間，同時改訂工作時間，以節省早晚所耗的電力。因爲環境關係，星期日雖亦有工作的，惟德國的電力生產，有百分之八十，是用火力發電的，故須極力節省民間的消耗，以備軍需之用。同時要節省汽油，所以老早就使用代替燃料。軍需部如促進改用代用燃料汽車起兒，曾有：「如在一定期間內，民間經營汽車業者，不改用代用燃料時，即取消本生油（Renzine）和柴油（Diesel）　配給許可證。」底聲明。　運輸方面，所有旅客列　數　，亦加以整理合併，並廢除餐車，臥車亦祇限於有公務上的必要者，至於其他非急需品的運輸，當然也廢除了。</p>
<p>意大利</p>
<p>意大利戰前的食糧自給率，達到百分之九十五，較之其他交戰國，可說是比較裕餘的。但爲了要供應德國的食料和勞働力之故，所以開戰不久亦即實行配給制度，她的配給量是：每人每日麵包一百五十克，肉類每週一百二十五克，橄欖油三百克，白塔油一百克，勞慟者的配給額，自然是比較多，病人也特別配給。不過較諸戰前，這個配給量似乎是不够，可是意大利國民，每人每日必需的熱量，不過是三千，所以祇要能維持這個度量，就不成問題了。去冬以來，勞働者且特別配給麵包。同時，由德國輸入了大批馬鈴薯，所以自十二月以後大都市裏的居民，也特別配給馬鈴薯。至於水菓，靑菜，乳酷之類是可以無限制購買的，惟因此類食糧，亦須供應德國之用，故仍有正當消費的規定。因此，爲了增加食糧的生產起見，戰前的荒地，今年都在積極地開墾了。</p>
<p>因爲被服以及周身所用的物品不足的關係，都一律改用代用品。被服之類，自前年十一月起，即實行配給證制度；牠的點數，分作男，女，少年，少女和幼童五類。每人每年男子百二十點，女子九十五點，其中三分之一，每四個月，即不能再用了。男服七十五點，大衣八十點，襯衫十點，手巾三點，皮鞋八十點；女服祇是六十點，所以假若是換了一套全新的衣服時，則下次的四個月中，速一塊手巾也不能買了。肥皂不在配給的限制以內，但肥皂是一種規定格式的物品，他如茶杯，茶壺的大小，都規定一個所謂戰時的規格模型，以期統一。其他日常生活品，也漸漸地規格化了。國民要在道規格之中，運營他們簡易的戰時生活。爲了節約勞働力和原料起見，自十月十二日起，兒童玩具一律禁止製造，今年三月以後，且禁止販賣了。</p>
<p>爲了紙，電力和瓦斯等項消費限制的原故，新聞紙的頁數，也該漸漸地减少。爲了節約燃料，電車行駛的次數，也就隨之减少。瓦斯每日供給三次，合計不過五個鐘頭。壓力也减到戰前的百分之八十五，窒內取暖用的煤炭，也將配給量實行减少，自用汽車也被廢止，代用的卡車，每日限五里特耳，公用卡車，每月也祇配給十里特耳的木生油，而所謂代用卞車，規定亦甚嚴，祇楚病人或者有緊急事件的人，才准乘坐普通人，差不多是不可能的。一切的住宅或資材，都以軍需爲第一，民需方面，限制極嚴。然而在意大利的國民，可以說是完全沒有作不平之鳴的。這實足以表現意大利的國民，絕對相信他們的首相墨索里尼和獲得最後勝利的原故。所以在意大利整個的國家中，完全無所謂黑市這四字，國民的意志，也一天一天地旺盛起來。</p>

<h3>日用品倐起漲風　將考慮計口配合　商人壟斷愈趨明顯　勢須干涉用維市面</h3>
<p>舊曆新歲以來、各項物價明漲暗升不已、　中尤以各項生活必需品爲取、如肥皂火柴兩項、　　開價時、固木每箱售八百四十元、至昨日（十三）已售至九百二十元、上升八十元之巨、其他各牌肥皂漲勢完全相彷、火柴　盤價鳳凰脾爲四千四百元、　後忽起漲風、一日間狂升千元之巨、至昨日（十三）已售至五千八百元美麗牌竟售至六千元、漲風之烈堪稱空前、此種情形、影響於市民生活至巨、故本市有關當局、即將加以嚴厲干涉、　業社記者頃探得各情如下、</p>
<p>肥皂火柴已受操縱</p>
<p>據該業中人吿商業社記者、最近肥皂火柴之忽起漲風、一般言之、雖屬存底枯竭、新貨並無生產、在物稀爲貴之原則下、價格自然上升、但上升程度、决不致如今日之甚、目火柴漲風、僅以鳳凰牌及美麗牌兩種爲　、其他如金鼎雜脾兩種、上漲比較有限顯見火柴漲風、並非完全起於　　物質之恐慌、而爲少數商人從中操縱、而至操縱至於頂點時、今日市塲交易、反極冷淡、蓋貨物價格過高買方已不敢問津、賣方則奇貨可居、朝天討價、致買賣　方、均陷於凍結狀態中、</p>
<p>維護民生　速籌善策</p>

<p>評價工作</p>
<p>本埠各業同業公會、前爲協助當局澈底　平物價計、均先後組設「物品評價委員會」、從事評價工作，組鄉頗爲縝密、凡奉令詳訂某種貨物限價時、即先通知會員、將此項物品及成本等、列表送會、然後召開評價委員會議、共同議訂標準限價然後備文送當局核奪、待認可後、始印評價單、分發各會昌同業、一體遵行、茲悉各業對於此項工作進行、殊不遺餘力、最近並鑒於百貨售價、復向高峯挺進、成爲促成高貨價之一種原因、事關市民生活、已予注視，</p>
<p>計劃增產</p>
<p>當局爲安定民生、抑平物價、取締投機囤積、切實執行限價、對於一切商品、不得非法買空賣空之交易、幷由各業設物價評議會、評定價格、呈准當局核准、依限發售、不准任意抬高或變更品級、以及其他一切不正當行爲、嗣後如因成本關係、確有變更價格之必要時、得由同業公會申叙理由、請求更定、此外、禁止以經營之商品、批發與非同業公會之會員、頃爲根本之圖、計劃增加日用·業品生產俾無感缺乏之處、如棉紗·布疋·麵粉·植物油·火柴·肥皂·洋燭·紙張·等日用工業品、其增產尤爲急要、今以全力恢復原有各項工廠、疏通原料來源、或覓用代替品、或求新發明、務期獲得實效、作减低日常必需品售價之根本解決、對於以上各項必需品之原料、設立機關、統一收實、採取配給制度、視各廠生產能力及實際需要、予以核配、各廠獲得配給原料所產之物品、必須依照規定限價、批發與各零售商門售、違者永久停止原料配給、並予懲辦、</p>

<h3>減輕保甲違章罰鍰</h3>
<p>— 葉晉泰</p>
<p>保甲本為維持地方治安及人民安全而設，今見報載法租界保甲違章罰鍰辦法，有幾點可以商討：</p>
<p>（一）身份居件證遺失罰廿元。查身份證旣應常常隨身携帶，則遺失乃雖免之事，雖十分當心，亦能遺失或被竊，若苦力或小販遺失一張身份證，勢必一日一家無飯吃，因之建議每次遺失身份證，改罰五元，無力被罰者得免罰。</p>
<p>（二）更動附戶，戶長不報吿者罰五十元。此條女中未註明過期幾天未報吿者應受處罰，查一附戶遷入，爲辦理覓保或拍照等手續，需相當時日，中國多文盲，此等人之戶口單需托他人代寫，亦需時日，若此等必需之時日、祗憑辦理保甲職員隨意規定，卽寃枉被罰者必大有人在，幷目易生弊端。</p>
<p>（三）法租界之民警團團員，每一聯保由聯保長在本聯保內　二十歲以上及三十五歲以下之居民中，用抽籤法指定七十五人。抽中者永遠站崗，僥倖而未抽中者，得永遠免役，此種辦法，似以應滿相當年齡者全體服　，或每半年換一批，輪流服　，如此較爲公允。</p>
<p>（四）聯保長皆義務服務者，對於保甲皆勞心勞力，墊錢及有大功者，不應因小渦耶處罰之。若非聯保長之過失而遺失臂竟者，不宜處罰之。若因彼之渦失而遺失者，則最好將「罰」字改爲「勉强捐助」。</p>
<h3>關於「擠電車」</h3>
<p>— 楊錫琪</p>
<p>申報讀者論壇上曾討論「擠電車」這一件事實在也是十交通問題筆者以爲本市市民分困難的，往往乘一次電車要等到半個鐘點以上之多，乘客們要想稍得優先擠上的話，每要冒着萬分的危險。實在是因爲乘客太多了，雖公司方面每天開出的車子已達最多數，仍舊是擁擠的。尤其是二十路。一路·十二路等等，可說每次都不會稍空的。在如此擠况之下，我覺得電車上應有下列種種改善：</p>
<p>（一）絕對禁止吸烟。近來電車上雖然有「禁烟」的佈告貼着，但是這祗是等於廢紙一般，仍是「你說你的，我行我素」。實在在車上吸烟是最危險的，小之足以燒壞他人的衣履、大之足以燒壞車身惹出大禍。同時在當局厲行禁止吐痰的場合，在車上尤其要嚴禁的。此外在極擁擠的時候，往往有工人等携帶了刀·鋸·等鋒利的鐵器，這是多麽危險啊！偶一不小心，非　傷。抑目害及自身，應注意才好。</p>
<p>（二）在極擁擠時，反而免費的公務員、或是電車公司穿制服的從業員，是絕對享受優先權的，我希望以後，凡是上述人等應該儘先讓給其他的乘客。並且在車上不能佔領坐位，而讓出錢的享受，庶免權利與義務不相平勻。</p>
<p>（三）自從廿一日起、電車公司改正站頭和車資之後，給予我們乘客防止賣票員的舞弊的便利良機、除了注意站頭和車資外，下車時應絕不把舊票還給賣票員，否則往往不幸遇着查票員時，竟常你乘客舞弊了，甚至受到侮辱責駡這不是寃枉嗎？</p>

<h3>棄妻</h3>
<p>— 鄭泉</p>
<p>接到友人的信、說友人某君近年來官運財運都亨通，一介寒士已成為有財有勢的紅人了。這位紅人第一步做「齊家」的工作，把他的糟糠之妻離棄，和一位女學校的「皇后」某女士正式結婚。</p>
<p>我國舊式婚姻，大都由於父母之命，媒妁之言，是不合理的。在新派人看來，這種非戀愛結合的婚姻是罪惡，因此，離婚是一種合理的救濟。</p>
<p>這種戀愛神聖的理論，是無可非議的。我們要　事實上來觀察研究。近二三十年來，我們所最常見的棄妻　　這兩種方　：</p>
<p>鄕間未受過敎育男女，憑父母之命，媒妁之言，結婚了。後來夫到都市裏受了新式敎育，第一件大事，便是和「鄉妻」離婚，另外跟受過敎育的女子結婚。</p>
<p>第二種方式，夫婦結婚，起初感情很好，生男育女。後來，夫得法了。在外竟和「摩登」女子非法結合，乃把年老色衰的妻視爲限中釘，片面地離棄。</p>
<p>儘管男女平等的口號喊破了喉嚨，事實上現社會却仍舊以男性爲中心。不少受過新式敎育的女子，嘴裏喊男女平權，而事實上常受「有婦之夫」的勾引，拆散人家家庭，這可說是「同性相殘」。至於有些受過新式敎育的男子，嘴裏喊男女平等，尊重女性，而事寳上玩弄女性，侮辱女性，蹂躪女性，更可說是「男性敗類」「女性的仇敵」。</p>
<p>記得「晏子春秋」裏有這麼節文字：</p>
<p>「景公有愛女，請嫁於晏子。公逎往燕晏子之家。飲酒酣　公見其妻，曰：『此子之內子耶？』晏子對曰：然，是也！』公曰：『嘻，亦老目惡矣！寡人有女，少且姣，請以滿失子之宮。』晏子違席面對曰：『乃　則老且惡，嬰與之居故矣，故及其少而姣世　且入固以壯託乎老，姣託乎惡，彼嘗託而嬰受之矣。君雖有賜，可以使嬰倍其託乎？』再拜而辭。」</p>
<p>這種機會，是近世一般「俊儏　之士所「寤寐求之」的，而晏子竟「　拜而辭」在『俊傑』們　來，一定連聲說晏子是「戇大」，是「傻瓜」，而恨自己「生不逢辰」，不能親遇齊景公也！</p>
<h3>生活小言</h3>
<p>— 許鴻笙</p>
<p>生活的樂趣是一種希望。有了希望然後生活下去那才有樂趣。</p>
<p>可是希望是有限度的，牠必須合理的，自己必須切切實實地去追求的，否則希望成了泡影，樂趣却成了煩惱。</p>
<p>那或者有人問：投機暴利的人，他們豈不是獲得了希望而成功了嗎？我們倒大可効法。可是你祇見到今日，却沒有見到他明日後日呢？這話絕對不是牽强附會，或是聊以自慰的、試觀連日刋載的聶雲台先生保富法，便知此語不虛。</p>
<p>有人說人生一夢耳何必終日碌碌若是？人生一夢，是言固然，但　，是夢你又怎樣呢？你能否立刻死掉？或是脫離人世；你能否不衣不食？旣然是夢那也得。一有生氣，有樂趣有意義的萝。</p>
<p>孔子栖栖壘皇　竟無寗日，墨子摩頂放踵，利大下爲之。他們做着這　的夢、倒一直刻劃在人們的心頭，而沒有褪淡的日子。</p>
<h3>老弱轉溝壑</h3>
<p>— 敬作</p>
<h3>店員們的成功因素</h3>
<p>— 我煦</p>
<p>無論那一個店員，當他加入某商店的時候，他總曾下過一翻心思，來審察是否適合自己的條件，這是因爲他希望由這理想的據點，來發展他的大才，來實現他自己　希望：由練習生而職員而組長而主任以至於　理經理，或者自己營業，由小店而大店，以至於行莊公司，當然這些目標並不是不能達到的，在整個企業圈裏，有許多成功了的大人物大企業家還不都是這樣一步步地爬上來的？可是照比例來講不過占極少數罷了。這是什麼道理　？簡單地說，是因爲每個成功者在充分的學識之外，尙有特殊的成功因素，以上所說只是就雇員方面自身來說：假如拿店家雇主方面來說，一個含有成功因素的店員對於業務上的助力，亦恐非我們可能　像的。這幾個因素擬定如下：</p>
<p>（一）樂業最重要　是這條，店員必須對他明從事的工作發生與趣，發生樂業的情緒，看得牠神聖偉大，是生命以外最寳貴的，精神上旣然得了安慰，工作纔肯盡心竭力，因此工作成績旣好，工作速度又高，自己的地位及聲譽日漸增高，店方業務也日漸與隆，理想目標　能逐個達到。</p>
<p>（二）進取　知足常樂雖然是一句名言，可是並不適用於知識的追求上？學校的書本裏和工作的經騐中，難然可以得到很多知識，可是世界之大，無奇不有。這裏有着我們以前所聞所未聞，見所未見的眞理和現狀。假如你不知進取，你將很快的被時代遺棄面落伍，再加上新陳代謝，適者生存的原理，就將受到同事們的排斥，和社會的擯棄，因此你必須熟讀各種書報雜誌研究各種文藝科學，使新書知識一齊增加，不以承受前人之工作知能爲滿足，應該窮源探本，仔細研究，改良舊法，創造新法，以適合個人及社會的需要。</p>
<p>（三）誠實　誠實就是「　」的表示，任何人都要有信用，尤其是店家的雇員們，誠實可靠的店員，才能委以重任，而往往較高的地位，鄒擁有相當車大的責任，所以一個能以信義去取他人信仰的，才能俸厚位尊，爲人領袖；否則輕者停職降俸，重者身敗名裂，苟能淹留本位，也不過暫時濫竽而已</p>
<p>（四）恒心　在從事一種工作的時候，起初總難免有困難發生，可是「愚公移山」，一鐵杵磨針」，這幾個民聞名諺，都是象徴那不易得到的恒心　回顧古今中外名人，那個不是因爲埋頭苦幹，才得到成功，假如一見異思遷」「好高鶩遠」，那末對自己工作，日益乏味，因之棄業改行，久而一無所精，一無所能，離自己甘標相去更遠了。</p>
<p>（五）謙虛　經過相當的工作時間之後，往往有許多店員（其他職業界也不是例外）因為有了相當的經騐，喜歡炫露才能，喜誇好勝，因此藝精者不願多教，德高者不願多勸，個中與妙，不能盡得，可謂爲山丸　，功虧一簣了。假若以前能低聲下氣，虛心請益，那末得益之多，恐非先料所及。</p>
<p>（六）客觀的眼光隨便那個雇客都觀迎　高值低的東西，可是對那些能特別滿足他們慾望的東西，却也不情高價購買，所店員若能，方面用客觀眼光，預測顧客心理，　方面用生動口才，理解或分析方法，說明本貨的價廉物美，富麗堂皇以引起他們的物質享受慾，那末貨物的頃購就很順利了</p>
<p>以上所舉幾條，不過是滄海之一粟，此外尚有許多，却需要諸位商店工作人員自己去收塲發掘了，總之，因素含有量越大，成功越速，成績也越佳。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十）（三）</p>
<p>一九一五年。從海到瑞士，各軍隊拼死搏鬥，各不相下。達達納爾海峽（Dardanelles），加甲波利（Gallipoli），很近　洛克菲爾德的地力，軍營如雨後春筍般成立起來；兵士們將遊戲的塲地當作運動與訓練之用；勃洛克菲爾德的軍官訓練團迅速地發展着。年輕的敎師們大都離開了，或者從　了。每一個星期日的晚上，在禮拜堂晚禱之後，查特里斯要讀出老學生戰死者的名字，並且每一個名字後附以短短的傳記，很動人；可是吉普斯，坐在樓下的黑色的座位裏，總在想：他們對於他，只是一些名字；他不會像我一樣，看見他們的面孔。……</p>
<p>一九一六年。…松末（Somme）河的戰投。某一個星期日的晚上，被讀出的名字有二十三個。到了那個危急的七月，在月底的某一個下午，查特里斯在威葛特夫人的屋子裏對吉普斯談着話。他工作過度，憂慮過度，很有些病態。「對你老實說，吉賓，我在這裏的日子眞不容易過，我三十九歲，你知道，並且沒有結婚，許多人似乎都在想，他們是知道我應該做的事情的。還有，我剛巧患着糖尿病，通不過那最盲目的軍醫官，但是我不懂爲什麼我應該將一張醫藥證明書釘在我的前門上。</p>
<p>吉普斯對於這事，並沒有預先知道過什麼；這倒使他吃了一驚，因爲他是喜歡查特里斯的。查特里斯繼續着說：「你看，事情是這樣。拉爾斯顧用了許多年輕人——當然都很好——可是其中大多數却已經加入了戰爭，替代的人，大體看來，都　可怕。上星期的某晚，在預備課中，他們將墨水從一個人的頸項上倒下去——蠢才——大發　歇斯的里病。我只好自己去上班，爲這些盞才代上預備課，每晚工作到半夜，弄得對於任何事情都打不起精神。我不能更長久地忍受這苦難了。如果下學期事情不會改，我要病倒了。」（卅五）</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>漫談「接血」</h3>
<p>— 蓬六</p>
<p>在上海有些人把金錢叫做「血」，這種說法一方面固然是舖張着錢的重要，一方面却亦表明了血的價値，因此當我們體內缺乏血液時，其恐慌直不亞於而更甚於缺乏金錢。</p>
<p>近代科學昌明，使人們大開眼界：人體不啻一架機器，各部如有損壞都可設法修補，就說血吧，當缺乏血液時，可用他人的血來補充，這種方法就是所謂『接血』或叫「輸血』，醫學上叫做『血液轉輸法』。</p>
<p>接血的意義旣如上述，要串演這齣戲的主角勢必有兩個：接受血液　叫受血者，接血給他人的叫給血者；而給血者必須具有相當資格，當然，給血者身體必須健康，尤須確實沒有傳染病，而最重要的資格是『血型』。原來人類血液雖表面上　樣是紅色的血，　在成分上却可分作不同的四類，假使取四類中任何二類的血混在一起，有幾種沒有變化。有的却可凝結成團，這種變化就因血的性質成分不同所致，這不同的四類在科學上叫作四種『血型』，每個人都有一個固定的血型，終身不變且與遺傳有關。給血者的血型必須與受血者相同，至少亦得與受血者的血不起變化，否則血液輸入即遭「凍結」不能　用，匪特無効抑且有害，所以在接血前須先檢查兩個主角的血型。此外還有些次要的條件如年齡血統性別等，但都不是十分必需的。</p>
<p>關於接血的方法有兩種：一是直接的，用一種輸血器一頭挿入給血者的血管一頭挿入受血者血管，靠器械的作用完成接血手續。另一種是間接的，把給血者的血抽出而加以化學藥品（如檸檬酸鈉）或用玻棒攪拌，使血不能凝固，然後注入受血者血管。兩法都有人用，而以間接法較多。</p>
<p>接血的功効頗爲顯著，接入的血中含有養料，還可有『滋補』的作用，所以在出血，貧血，傳染病，抵抗力薄弱等時都可用之；但在其幾種疾病如心臟病，腎臟病，高血壓，血管硬化，糖尿病等時却不可施行。此外當血中有毒時，可以先將毒血放去一部分再接入健康的血液，亦很有効。</p>
<p>有許多醫生時常勸病人接血，這種方法確有相當理由，因爲祇要符合上述種種情形，接血總是有好無歹的；不過醫生們必須也要考慮到受血者的經濟負擔，因爲每次接血是需相當昂貴的費用的。</p>
<p>由於費用的問題使我想到外國時常有人自願把血據慨輸將給貧苦病人，不取任何酬報，這種俠義的精神的確値得我們仿効，因為在健康的人假使輸去若干血液後反可生出更多的血來，毫無危險。再由此牽連地說到上海人所說的『血』，在這年頭兒『血』的來處非易，任何人在自奉上都應努力『節血』，而在社會上患『貧血』的人很多，我　更該慷慨『接血』較諸上述的接血更是便利，給血者既不受血型限制，受血者又無須有所禁忌，所以我們都應把自身『節』下來的『血』去『接』給他人，一來使他人免於缺『血』恐慌，二來輸去若干『血』後反可生出更多的『血』，繼續去『接血』，那末結果一定可使人人『血』旺運通，社會亦得臻於健　了。</p>
<h3>苦悶</h3>
<p>— 寒毅靜</p>
<p>「苦悶」會使人消極，並且更會傷害人的身體與精力</p>
<p>不過「苦悶」的產生，實在非常複雜，當然現實的給他不滿，是原因之一，但是內心自相的矛盾，有它自然的結果。例如他理想的事情或環境，與外界的事實完全相反，因此使他對現實的一切，都感不滿，因此形成了他的「苦悶」。</p>
<p>苦悶是誰都有的，就是萬金的巨富，亦有他苦悶的地方與時期，不過所存在的內容不同吧了。「苦悶」在一般發展法則上說來，是一切新的發展的現象，就是說，每件事物都有它矛盾的存在，當矛盾相互衝突時，就使事物向前發展——發展至另一新的階段。</p>
<p>不過這發展的動力，還得靠主觀的力量來產生，否則非但沒有發展，而且會產生以上不良的結果，即是使人走向消極悲觀的道路，使身體健康走向衰弱的地步。</p>
<p>因苦悶形成了如此的現象，更失確了生命的知趣，那能還談得上學習的進步和事業的成功呢？社會服務</p>

<h3>National Economic Mobilization</h3>
<p>The National Economic Committee convened its first National Economic Conference in Beijing on the 12th to discuss wartime economic policies. This newspaper offered its humble opinions in an earlier article. It is expected that this conference will be able to make necessary achievements in all policies concerning our country's wartime economy. Our country's current economy is complex and multifaceted, especially now, which can be said to be a critical moment of life and death. The government authorities must carefully discuss and seek comprehensive policies and measures. The private sector's economic circles must also pay close attention to the current situation and strive to move towards the future of reforming and strengthening the national economy. Under this ideal, the efforts of the government authorities alone are not enough. It is essential to have the cooperation of social forces and, under the guidance of national policies, mobilize the strength of the national economy to complete a long-term battle. On the one hand, the national economic strength should be used to ensure the smooth completion of national policies. On the other hand, national policies should guide the national economy towards reform and strengthening.</p>
<p>First of all, we hope that the government authorities will realize the centralization of national economic power and make planned, unified, and rational use of it. (1) It is necessary to first universally and thoroughly adjust and strengthen political institutions at all levels and implement wartime organization for various industrial sectors. Provide assistance and guidance to enterprises and private economic organizations, strengthen their organization, and enhance their strength. (2) It is essential to ensure that all economic sectors move in the same direction, take the same steps, and implement policies consistently and effectively, without any one sector or region lagging behind, hindering other sectors or regions, and ultimately affecting the overall situation. (3) Grassroots organizations and grassroots work must be adjusted, especially to reasonably allocate local economic realities and supply and demand situations. Regarding the control of resources, effectively manage production on the one hand, and control labor on the other. At the same time, conduct a thorough investigation and universal registration of static resources. For dynamic resources, strictly manage the market and stabilize prices under the principle of not hindering the smooth flow of goods. (4) Rising prices have a huge impact on military needs and people's livelihoods, and efforts to stabilize prices should be increased daily. The government should also enable the competent authorities to plan to supply essential agencies with physical goods as a principle. Raw materials required by military, public, and production agencies should be supplied within the possible scope. The compilation of government budgets and the calculation of production costs should also be based on the principle of supplying physical goods. (5) Under the goal of "total participation in the war," public opinion should be encouraged and society guided to increase the efficiency of spiritual mobilization, so that the whole country understands the true meaning of participating in the war, recognizes its own obligations, and jointly plans to proceed, achieving "total mobilization" through economic mobilization.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hope that the private economic sector—the financial sector and the industrial sector—will: Firstly, in this extraordinary period, recognize the position of our country, recognize the environment surrounding our national economy, adapt to the trends and needs of the times, and determine the direction of economic cooperation with national policies and the coordinated development of the national economy from top to bottom. Here, we must particularly recognize that if the economic sector (whether financial or industrial) does not have a strong government to provide unified and planned guidance and control, allowing private individuals to develop freely in an anarchic manner, then the danger to China's economic future is unimaginable. Similarly, if the government's national policies and its mobilization plans and control and management operations do not receive the voluntary cooperation of the private sector, then the national policy plans and their implementation will definitely not achieve the desired results. Therefore, the cooperation between the government and the private economic sector must be expressed more closely in the future. Secondly, it is undeniable that at present, factories are completely unplanned and disorganized in their production. Those that are simple and profitable are pursued like ducks, while those that are difficult and less profitable are shrunk back from. The most serious thing is that some production is expressed as duplication or waste, while another part is often lacking in materials due to no one caring about it. As the situation develops, national control will inevitably be implemented. Rather than being passively controlled, why not become aware of the problem as soon as possible and jointly seek division of labor and cooperation to implement planned production? Therefore, cooperation between industrial sectors is even more urgently needed. Thirdly, in the past, the financial sector operated independently. In the future, it should practice the wartime mission of the financial sector with a more far-sighted vision and a correct understanding, focusing its efforts on assisting the government in regulating finances and increasing production.</p>
<p>The mobilization of the national economy also requires the cooperation of the general public. We must recognize the meaning of participating in the war, and we must recognize that after participating in the war, we must live a wartime life. We have indeed suffered the pain of war in the past, but this pain is definitely not enough to pay for the price that victory should have. From today onwards, we will encounter a real test. We have no doubt that we will succeed in the test. We must endure for the current pain, and we must express contempt for the current enjoyment. We must dedicate all of our static strength to participate in the total war.</p>

<h3>Hopes for the National Economic Committee</h3>
<p>The first plenary session of the National Economic Committee has been held in Nanjing since the 12th, engaged in deliberating various wartime economic policies. The specific direction of increasing production, reforming economic institutions, saving materials, and promoting material exchange will all be discussed in future meetings. We are paying very close attention to this meeting.</p>
<p>During the war, China's main task lies in the economy, especially the increase in material production and its mobilization, which is conducive to boosting national power. The National Economic Committee's discussion of the development of production power and the planning of wartime economic advancement is precisely because this is the central issue after China's participation in the war and the specific direction of all future policies. The scope of China's participation in the war and the impact on the overall situation in East Asia will be answered at the meeting. Therefore, the content of the meeting is also highly noteworthy in the international sense.</p>
<p>The National Economic Committee has gathered powerful figures from all walks of life to form the most unified front in the peace camp. In order to complete the war, we hope that the committee should eliminate all tendencies of factionalism. At the same time, close integration with all sectors is also a necessary condition. The National Economic Committee itself can be regarded as the embodiment of this kind of integration, and its smooth operation is a direct demonstration of the unified tendency within the peace camp, which is of great importance. If the committee has a passive tendency in internal affairs, we will be greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Shanghai financial figures are participating in the committee, and they are sincerely engaged in the discussion of the wartime economy. Therefore, the results of the meeting will have a significant impact on the future trends of national capital. The political and financial circles, Nanjing and Shanghai, will also be able to communicate through this meeting. Therefore, if the plenary session can proceed smoothly from beginning to end, it will not only lay a solid foundation for wartime economic construction, but also make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the national government. The establishment of a wartime economy and the strengthening of the national government depend on the effective use of the committee, and the government should have a full understanding of this.</p>
<p>We are closely watching the results of the committee's discussion on specific policies to establish a wartime economic system and increase production. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the government and the members of the committee will, in view of the great significance of the meeting, proceed with a cautious attitude and work hard to conduct this meeting. All aspects at home and abroad are paying great attention to this meeting. How will China fare during the war? Can the national government be strengthened? It all depends on the results of this meeting. We solemnly ask the national government and all members of the committee to face this fact squarely.

<h3>National Economic Conference Has Ended Successfully, Chen Junhui and Others Expressed Their Thoughts on the Conference, Ambassador Shigegu Mitsukiyo Attended as a Committee Member</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 13 (Central News Agency) - The National Economic Committee held its first National Economic Conference the day before yesterday (the 12th). It made decisions on the wartime economic system and various policies. The conference has ended successfully. The reporter specifically visited Chen Junhui, Secretary General of the Economic Committee, Yu Jinhe, Supervisor of the Construction General Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Bank of Communications, to ask about their thoughts on the conference. They were pleased to give their views separately. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen briefly said, "After the National Government participated in the war, the first National Economic Conference was convened to discuss the wartime economic system, and its significance is extremely important. My feelings are about four points: (1) This conference was the first to be convened after our country participated in the war, so it has a very close relationship with all of our country's wartime economic construction. (2) The participants in this conference included domestic financial giants and economic experts, which can be said to be an integration of officials and people, and its significance is extremely important. (3) This conference had detailed discussions and decisions on national economic policies and implementation plans, and in the future, we can follow this and work hard to move forward. (4) This conference has determined the future wartime economic policy direction and will send it to the Supreme National Defense Council for deliberation so that it can be promulgated by the National Government and implemented by the whole country to complete wartime economic construction."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu briefly said, "Under the current system, economic issues are the most important. It is necessary to determine a perfect wartime economic system. The National Economic Committee therefore convened the first National Economic Conference after participating in the war. During the conference, the economic authorities of the country gathered together, sincerely shared their views, and discussed all issues. All important economic policies have been decided to facilitate future implementation according to this. With the current unity and sincere solidarity between officials and people in our country, and with the close cooperation from our friendly nation Japan, I believe that there will be no difficulties in the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Tang briefly said, "What the National Economic Conference has shown can fully demonstrate the unity and cooperation of opinions between officials and people throughout China. I feel that the current wartime economic policies in our country have already determined a direction in this conference. However, the key lies in how to work hard to do it. I sincerely hope that the whole country will work together and move forward together to establish a wartime economic system to assist in completing the Greater East Asia War."</p>

I am especially honored that you are visiting the Japanese Ambassador's residence today. This time, economic industrialists in your country have worked together to establish wartime economic strategies, which is not only deeply related to your country, but also related to Greater East Asia in a broader sense. The development of your country's industry and economic development will benefit both your country and East Asia. I hope that everyone present will work hard to develop the economy.

<h3>Newspaper Commentary: The Political Situation in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 13 (Central News Agency) - The Yomiuri Hochi here published an editorial today entitled "The Blows to Chongqing," detailing the blows that Chongqing suffered last year and pointing out Chongqing's resentment towards the empty promises of aid from Britain and the United States. The main idea is that, as a result of the fighting between the Japanese army and the Chongqing army on the Chinese front last year, a total of 260,805 Chongqing soldiers were killed, 124,408 were captured, 109 Chongqing aircraft were shot down, and countless other military supplies were seized. Compared with the previous year's battle results, the number of Chongqing soldiers killed has decreased slightly, but the number of prisoners has increased by 20,210, which proves that Chongqing's fighting spirit has obviously declined in this year. Roosevelt previously referred to Chiang Kai-shek as a hero of Asia in his address to Congress and, as usual, praised Chongqing's unyielding attitude of resistance and expressed his determination to provide support. Later, when he saw that our country and the National Government had signed an agreement to return the concessions in China and abolish extraterritorial rights in China, he was greatly embarrassed and immediately issued a false and useless communique. He also prepared to wave the item of aiding Chongqing in the conclusion of the Canada-Hong Kong talks and frequently sent secret signals to Chongqing. This kind of ineffective statement and record, in terms of weapons, materials, food, and other aspects, is in dire straits in Chongqing, which is not only worthless, but also causes the Chongqing side to feel more distressed. The Chongqing side also protested severely to the United States because their blank checks were often not cashed. Chongqing's resentment can be seen in general. On the other hand, in our Sino-Japanese relations, since the National Government participated in the war, both in name and in reality, it has entered a stage of living and dying together. If the concessions are returned and extraterritorial rights are abolished, our country will immediately proceed with preparations in accordance with the agreement and, on the 8th of this month, transfer more than a thousand enemy properties seized by our army in China since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to the National Government for management. All of this is enough to benefit the development of the National Government. Today, the control of Chongqing is not only an enemy of our Asia, but also an enemy of Chongqing itself.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Stabilization Fund Will Be Abolished Immediately</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 13 (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing news, the "Stabilization Fund" here has been ordered to be abolished yesterday and merged into the "Ministry of Finance." The internal reason is that Chongqing did not heed the purpose of the "Fund" and continued to issue banknotes indiscriminately. As a result, it suffered the bad consequences of inflation, which invisibly forced the "Fund" to suspend work. After the death of the American "member" of the "Fund," Fox, last year, the American side did not send anyone to take over. The British "member," Rogers, will return to his country recently. Moreover, the expenses of the "Fund" are huge. At this time, Chongqing's finances are in dire straits, and it has long planned to abolish it. However, it could not obtain the consent of the United States and Britain. Recently, it received a telegram from Chiang from the United States, so the "Fund" was abolished immediately.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Southern Shandong Expands Battle Results</h3>
<p>Jinan, February 13 (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army recently surrounded about 2,000 Chongqing soldiers entrenched in the mountains 25 kilometers south of Huang County in southern Shandong, who were constantly making trouble in the area. They launched a fierce attack on the 11th, and are now expanding their battle results. The battle results that were identified as of the evening of the 11th are as follows: 42 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were left behind, 187 were captured, and 384 rifles, 5 heavy machine guns, 18 light machine guns, 1 automatic rifle, pistols, and many other items were seized.</p>
<p>Laiwu, February 13 (Central News Agency) - The area near Xinpu Mountain in Laiwu and Xintai County, Shandong Province, was previously occupied by bandits and communists, who even organized a pseudo-Xinpu County government. In early January of this year, after the joint suppression by the police teams of Laiwu and Xintai Counties, it was completely destroyed. The local people have also realized that the communist resistance war is wrong and have brought their only concealed weapons, including 300 rifles, 500 rifle bullets, 600 grenades, 1,000 grenade launchers, 400 small cannons, 100 landmines, and other gunpowder and food, to surrender to the National Government. They held surrender ceremonies in Laiwu and Xintai Counties on the 9th and 10th of this month. According to reports, those who surrendered this time included Xu Kongguan, former director of the Shandong Provincial Anti-Japanese Branch, and 911 members of the Communist Party, 1,596 soldiers, 311 political work committee members, and 6,919 civilians in Laiwu County. In Xintai County, there were 63 members of the former Communist Party Committee of Xinpu County, 1,400 soldiers, 137 political work committee members, and 2,179 civilians. After the communist forces were eliminated, the area has suddenly taken on a bright outlook.</p>
<h3>Former Navy Attache Maeda Succeeds at Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11 (Central News Agency) - Rear Admiral Daigu Kiyoshi, the naval attache of the Japanese Embassy in China, is about to leave Beijing to take up a new position due to being ordered to be transferred to an important position.

It is now known that the Japanese government has appointed Rear Admiral Maeda Minoru as the successor to the naval attache in China. Rear Admiral Maeda graduated from the Naval Academy in 1913 and entered the Naval University for easy reading. In 1914, he served as the captain of a ship in the Yangtze River Fleet. After 1931, he served as the naval attache at the Embassy in the Soviet Union, the director of the Hainan Island Special Service Department, the chief of staff of the training fleet, and the director of the Third Department of the Naval General Staff. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he once served as the director of the Naval Reporting Department of the Imperial Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Hunger Strike Enters Third Day - Bengal Assembly Demands Unconditional Release - Declares to Government They Will Be Responsible Should Anything Happen - Over 60,000 Arrested Since Start of Indian Independence Movement</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital City, 13th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - Mahatma Gandhi of India, at the advanced age of 73, has entered the third day of his hunger strike. While the British and American sides seem to intentionally downplay it, the anxiety among the Indian people is growing daily. According to reports from Calcutta, the Bengal Assembly passed a special motion yesterday demanding the unconditional and immediate release of Gandhi, and declaring to the Indian government that they would be responsible should anything happen to Gandhi given his age and frailty. Indian liberal leaders have convened 150 notables for a meeting in Madrid next week to discuss the matter. As for Gandhi's condition, his two attending physicians reported yesterday morning that he is still in good condition. Gandhi has stopped his daily walks. Furthermore, according to Reuters from London, London newspapers are giving prominence to Prime Minister Churchill's military report in the House of Commons, with news of Gandhi's hunger strike receiving only a small mention. According to Reuters from Washington, Americans have paid little attention to it.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - Reports from Bombay claim that the Bombay government has issued an official announcement that Gandhi, aged 73, began a 21-day hunger strike four days ago to protest his continued imprisonment by British authorities and is now experiencing vomiting. The announcement states, "Although Gandhi has suffered from vomiting, causing restless sleep, on the fourth day of his hunger strike, his general condition is still satisfactory." It is reported that Gandhi announced at the beginning of his hunger strike that he would not consume any food for 21 days, only water and fruit juice, and that those close to Gandhi are deeply concerned about whether Gandhi, in such frail health, will be able to endure the hunger strike.</p>
<p>Britain Believes Release Would Be Equivalent to Surrender</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Gandhi's hunger strike, the 400 million people of India are extremely concerned about his health due to his advanced age. Although the British government is extremely anxious internally about Gandhi's hunger strike, it outwardly pretends to be calm. London newspapers are also publishing only a brief mention of Gandhi's hunger strike, as instructed by British intelligence. According to a Reuters report from the 12th, the British government believes that unconditionally releasing Gandhi would be tantamount to the Viceroyalty surrendering to the Congress Party, which would have a significant impact on Indian national defense. Furthermore, reports from Madras indicate that Indian Ragigopalari has pointed out the seriousness of the situation and stated that if India does not immediately seek appropriate measures, a major crisis that cannot be reversed may occur.</p>
<p>Indians in Thailand to Fast</p>
<p>Bangkok, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The 30,000 Indians in Thailand will also observe a fast tomorrow to show their sympathy for Gandhi's hunger strike. Indians here will hold a mass meeting tomorrow to pray for Gandhi and express their determination to fight for Indian freedom.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 13th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Important Indian politicians will hold a meeting next Thursday in New Delhi to discuss Gandhi's hunger strike.

<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in the German Weekly, in which, in addition to expressing his confidence in Germany's victory, he urged the people in the rear to unite as one. The gist of the article is that the morale of the German people is extremely high, that they have absolute confidence in the final victory, and that the brave fighting of the German soldiers in Stalingrad has made the German people aware of how tragic the war is. The German people must strengthen their determination to overcome any difficulties and, under the leadership of the President, unite as one, fight bravely, and achieve final victory. The enemy's winter offensive has shown that the ultimate goal cannot be achieved with only part of our strength, and therefore we must fight with all our strength. We have all the necessary conditions for victory. The soldiers on the front lines are currently taking a defensive stance against the enemy's winter offensive, but behind these soldiers, a large number of troops have been continuously deployed to complete preparations for the future offensive. The German people are now waiting to begin great actions in order to achieve victory. In order to ensure the success of these actions, all our people must, under the leadership of the President, unite as one and advance bravely with iron determination.</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere in Syonan Island Under Japanese Rule - Order Restored, Markets on the Road to Prosperity - Rapid Changes in Politics and Economics</h3>
<p>Syonan, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It has been a year since Singapore fell. Recalling the time of its fall on February 15th of last year, the chaos in the city had reached its extreme. At that time, tens of thousands of enemy troops, having lost their commander and without a place to return, threw away their armor and abandoned their weapons, wandering in the city. All the shops were closed, and the flames in the oil tanks lit up the sky. Water, electricity, oil, coal gas, and other facilities were completely destroyed. The people were panicking and living in fear, and the scene was extremely tragic. After the Japanese army occupied the city, they immediately cleared out the unruly elements in the city to pacify the good people, enabling Singapore's security to quickly recover from the turmoil. They continued to repair water and electricity to benefit the citizens. Shops in the city gradually reopened, and refugees also returned in succession. By this point, the prosperous situation was far beyond what it had been before the war. The population here was said to be 760,000 before the war. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, residents from all over Malaya flocked here to take refuge, so when the Japanese army occupied it, the total population was over one million. There were extremely rich reserves of materials here, especially food. Although a plague was once discovered, it was quickly eradicated thanks to the efforts of the Japanese health authorities. In early March, former Vice Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. Ota Mao, took office as the first mayor of Syonan. Military advisor Mr. Sunada Shigemasa and Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika also came one after another to promote politics and actively build the city. Everything showed rapid progress. Japanese language is also commonly heard. The Raffles statue erected in the city center, originally one of Singapore's famous landmarks, has now been dismantled and transported to the museum for preservation. The large sports field next to it, which was exclusively occupied by the British before the war, has now been opened as a place for local residents to exercise. Every day, young people from China, India, and Malaya gather here happily to play football. Those living in Malaya and Sumatra have recently joined forces to organize training groups. The Syonan Public Service Association will soon be established. The Malay Peninsula was originally a human race exhibition hall. The residents are of extremely diverse races. Now, the main ones are overseas Chinese, Indians, Malays, and mixed Eurasian races. Among the overseas Chinese, most are from Fujian and Guangdong. Among the Indians, there are also Tamil, Egyptian, and Sikh ethnicities. The customs and habits of each ethnic group are different, and their lives and languages are also different. The British government has historically exploited these shortcomings to oppress them on a large scale. For a hundred years, all ethnic groups have suffered humiliation and hardship. Even religion and language have been greatly affected. The British have abused their power here, so that they are happy and do not think of returning home. There are many who consider this place their second home. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Singapore, which the British boasted was the Gibraltar of the East, was occupied by the Japanese army on February 15th of last year. At this point, the residents realized that only Japan was capable of guiding Malaya. In the past year, there have been rapid changes in politics, economics, and all aspects of life. Local residents are working with the authorities to build the city, especially the overseas Chinese, who account for about half of Malaya's 5.5 million population, are cooperating more actively. Before the war, the overseas Chinese in Malaya and Singapore provided millions of Yuan in aid to Chongqing, an important transfusion route for the front. However, since the fall of Singapore, the overseas Chinese have realized the current situation and deeply regretted their past mistakes. They have turned to cooperating with Japan to build a new Malaya. Soon after, the Syonan Overseas Chinese Association was established, led by Dr. Lin Wenqing, former president of Xiamen University, to launch a 50 million Yuan dedication movement for practical cooperation. Later, when the military administration and the Ministry of Finance issued one million Yuan in lottery tickets, they sold most of them, showing their enthusiasm for cooperation in everything. After the Japanese army occupied Singapore, the Overseas Chinese Bank, which had suspended operations, reopened on April 28 thanks to the goodwill of the military administration and Japanese banks. From May 1, civilian ships also resumed free navigation. The economic activities of the overseas Chinese have fully recovered to their former state, and they are now actively cooperating with the authorities, centered on the Overseas Chinese Association, to promote social welfare undertakings. They first started registering unemployed overseas Chinese on September 20, trying to introduce them to jobs. At the same time, they cooperated with the authorities' population dispersion policy to fundamentally solve the unemployment problem. They built civilian villages outside Syonan City, which can accommodate about 1,000 households, and expanded orphanages, enthusiastically engaged in social welfare undertakings for the elderly and young people. All social welfare undertakings are enthusiastically embraced. All the overseas Chinese in Malaya are now fully aware of the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and they have achieved great results in cooperating to rebuild a new Syonan.</p>
<h3>British Lieutenant General Heath Discusses the Elements of Japanese Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - As the first anniversary of the fall of Singapore, a strategic point for the British in East Asia, is approaching, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Press Department here received yesterday a copy of the memoirs of defeat of Lieutenant General Heath, commander of the British Indian Army's 3rd Corps dispatched to Malaya. Lieutenant General Heath was in charge of defending the Malay Peninsula before the fall of New Island (Singapore). This memoir is divided into two parts: one is to infer the future from defeat, and the other is to analyze the elements of Japanese victory. The first part records that the British side consistently carried out intimidation propaganda before the war, lacked close preparation, and also describes the shortcomings of the anti-Axis strategy. The second part records the elements of the Japanese victory, divided into several items such as the excellence of mobility, the psychological effect of shooting, the use of military force, the旺盛士氣, and the excellence of command. There are also many excuses for the defeat of the British army. In conclusion, he stated that the Japanese army's plan can be called a military model. The Japanese army fought with unprecedented power in its history, and we were finally defeated.</p>
<h3>German Economic Minister Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas Agency dispatch) - Economic Minister Funk delivered an important speech at the German Bank here today.</p>
<h3>World War Situation Overview</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Telephone) England and America are now frantically promoting a counteroffensive against the Axis powers. In the current stage of the world war, the Anglo-American camp is by no means in a dominant position. In the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army is enduring hardships and inflicting heavy blows on the American forces. The German army is abandoning Stalingrad in order to increase its strength for its spring offensive. The Anglo-American camp is clamorously broadcasting news of the Anglo-American counteroffensive's success, which is actually beneficial to the Axis. Propaganda policy is a means adopted due to a lack of strength. Japan, which has already established an inevitable victory in the East Asian war, and Germany, which has already established a foothold in Europe—the Axis powers are now maintaining silence. However, this is a silence to strengthen their power during the process of advancing towards victory. Now, let us try to glimpse the steps of the Axis powers' future advance.</p>
<p>Solomon Islands Front</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the General Headquarters on the 9th, in the Solomon Islands, in order to avoid meaningless sacrifices and ensure a strategic stronghold of superiority, the Japanese army retreated. Under the enemy's air supremacy, it fought against the superior American forces, inflicting heavy blows upon them. This is the frontline covering force for constructing a rear area of strategic advantage. Therefore, the soldiers completed their mission in unprecedentedly harsh conditions and in the enemy's camp with difficult supply lines. The retreat has now ended, and Japan has now reorganized its posture of strategic superiority.</p>
<p>The importance of the Southwest Pacific front is no less than that of other fronts. The Japanese army is now strengthening its difficult supply lines and increasing its air power. The new front line in the future is worthy of our attention. In addition to what was announced by the General Headquarters on the 9th, the damage inflicted on the enemy during this period, from the first Solomon Sea battle to the recent Battle of Rennell Island, and the active role of naval aircraft south of Isabel Island, totals 114 ships sunk or damaged, and over 996 aircraft shot down. Among the ships, 6 battleships were sunk and 4 were damaged, 4 aircraft carriers were sunk and 4 were damaged. Sixty percent of the main force of the entire American fleet has been turned into algae in the South Pacific. Due to the destruction of the fleet, the loss of American personnel is also in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>This victory has awakened Australia, and American public opinion has also risen up to attack the government and Roosevelt, the mastermind behind inciting the war. No matter how much he promotes the superiority of the Anglo-American camp, he has to remain silent on this number. The enemy's air power also holds an advantage in the long and arduous battle in the Solomon Islands, but the Japanese army often uses its inferiority to crush the enemy's counteroffensive attempts. The Japanese army's land-based aircraft have now been strengthened and occupy strategic strongholds. Because there is no strong air power on land and sea to cover them, they cannot be freely active. Now, the air control position in that area has been replaced, so we can wait and see their future activity.</p>
<p>Aleutian Islands Front</p>
<p>The Aleutian islands of Attu, Agattu, and Kiska, shrouded in severe cold and snow, are still peaceful and uneventful. It is an undeniable fact that the United States is planning to seize the two islands with the shortest distance for air raids on the Japanese mainland. We should be vigilant when the ice melts and the snow thaws between May and June, when the weather improves. The United States is actively implementing measures to strengthen Alaska. In addition to the Alaska air route, it is also laying new railways from Anchorage to key locations in the Aleutian Islands. The enemy has built solid bases and air bases. The United States plans to seize the two islands of Attu and Kiska to restore the safety of the Bering Strait route, open a front line to aid the Soviet Union and Chiang Kai-shek, and attempt to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. On isolated islands with difficult supply lines dozens of kilometers away, Japanese soldiers are resisting enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Mainland China Front</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek, who is engaged in meaningless resistance and is called a traitor, is eking out a precarious existence in the interior under the constant pressure of the Japanese army, with the Anglo-American-proclaimed counteroffensive against Japan as his only hope. The posture of the Chongqing regime is truly pathetic.</p>
<p>The American air force's reckless actions in China have been attacked by the Japanese army stationed in China and have fled into the interior. The opening of the aid route to Chiang Kai-shek has not shown any effect.</p>
<p>The call of the Anglo-American forces in India to recapture Burma and reopen the Burma Road has become a mere fantasy under the Japanese army's impregnable defenses. Prime Minister Tojo's statement in the Diet regarding Burma's independence has further strengthened the unity of the Burmese people and stimulated the independence movement of 400 million people in India. Chiang Kai-shek's desire to open a route from India through northwest China has not been realized to date.</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime is now making its best efforts to develop the northwest. Even if it succeeds, the Soviet Union cannot but focus on the German spring offensive, and England and America are busy supplying various battlefronts around the world. Therefore, it is obvious that little aid material can be obtained by Chiang Kai-shek. Even if the rumored visit of Chiang Kai-shek to the United States is true, how much compensation can he obtain from England and America? The cunning Roosevelt often says one thing and means another, sacrificing his own property to the United States. In fact, Chiang has become the commander-in-chief of the American Chinese Expeditionary Force, but the innocent people under Chiang's rule are to be pitied.</p>
<p>On January 9, when the National Government entered the war, Japan simultaneously returned concessions and other territories, making a major change in its policy toward China. This was tantamount to eliminating the pretext for resistance against Japan in Chongqing at the root. Key figures and young people in Chongqing are clearly showing signs of wavering. In the future Chinese war situation, what remains is only the reckless action of the American air force.</p>
<p>German-Soviet Front</p>
<p>The Soviet winter counteroffensive has recaptured Stalingrad. Marshal Paulus's German Sixth Army and the German Air Force's anti-aircraft division, two Romanian divisions, and a Croatian regiment, totaling about 250,000 men, were besieged by the Red Army for months, preparing for the counteroffensive against the Soviet Union, which determined the fate of the entire German army on the Eastern Front. This spirit of fierce fighting is worthy of respect.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's winter counteroffensive this time was carefully prepared, unlike the previous winter counteroffensive. The Soviet Union sacrificed a great deal of combat power and consumption, and it succeeded due to the improvement of the North African war situation, the landing of Anglo-American forces in West Africa, and other factors, so it cannot but be said to be an accidental event. The Soviet Union only had the opportunity to confront people around Stalingrad. In other areas, the German army retreated in a predetermined manner to reorganize the front line and avoid the Red Army's large forces.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has even mobilized reserve forces, gathering 90 divisions, totaling one million men, in front of Stalingrad. Regardless of the unfavorable consumption of winter warfare, it used more than 50 tanks to break through the German lines in one go. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's domestic military production capacity is progressing extraordinarily.</p>
<p>The two armies are still continuing to engage in fierce fighting in the Don River basin. The result cannot yet be predicted, but the Soviet counteroffensive has reached its peak and will gradually weaken in the future. The German army's decision on the winter line will largely stop near the strongholds of the German spring offensive.</p>
<p>The goal proclaimed by the Soviet Union is the capture of Rostov, which has become a problem in the winter war situation. On the German side, ensuring Rostov is an absolutely necessary condition for preparing for future offensives. Although the Soviet Union's winter counteroffensive has temporarily succeeded, it has paid a great price.</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union has already used important strategic reserve forces to defend against the German spring offensive.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet army reduced the troops on other fronts and forcibly advanced under huge consumption.</p>
<p>(3) It lost more than 5,000 tanks, a large number of aircraft, and a great deal of manpower.</p>
<p>(4) In the difficult winter, it further extended its supply line.</p>
<p>(5) The winter war is over, and the spring war will follow. The front line must be reorganized, and troops must be moved.</p>
<p>(6) Therefore, this meaningless winter war has prevented the troops from getting rest.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current success will create unfavorable conditions for the future spring war. Conversely, the German army's loss of Stalingrad and the loss of many forward strongholds are precisely to avoid the disadvantages of winter warfare as much as possible, and to use a strategy of retreat, not consuming troops before the spring offensive, so that they can get adequate rest. Soon, after the winter has passed and new elite troops are deployed to key points, the German army will launch an overwhelming air force, like an angry wave, to avenge Marshal Paulus and the 200,000 men in that city. The future spring offensive is particularly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>North African Front</p>
<p>The second front proclaimed by England and America, the landing operation in Africa, has not constrained the German-Italian forces as desired. On the contrary, it has provided a good food source for the Axis submarines. The sharply reduced tonnage of Anglo-American ships is even more precarious. The British Eighth Army has failed to successfully pursue Rommel's army. Now, Rommel's army is advancing south in Tunisia with the momentum of a broken bamboo, joining up with the German army under Arnim. In Tunisia, Bizerte, Gafsa, and Gabes have formed a longitudinal line, consolidating the important areas on the eastern coast of Tunisia, preparing for a counteroffensive against the British, American, and Free French forces. Last summer, Rommel's elite mechanized unit of the German army pursued the British Eighth Army to Egypt, eyeing Cairo and Alexandria. Because its supply had to pass through the desert, it was extremely difficult, so it had to retreat to Tunisia. Now, the difficulty of supply has turned to the British Eighth Army. Not only has it failed to strike the retreating Rommel's army, but it must now be on guard against the Axis forces' counteroffensive from Tunisia at all times.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American forces that landed in Algiers and Morocco originally intended to annex Tunisia and attack southern Italy, but the German-Italian forces had already concentrated heavy troops in Sicily, Tunisia, and Pantelleria, securing this triangular stronghold and taking a counteroffensive posture against England and America. The complete control of Tunisia is imminent. The Anglo-American landing in North Africa has failed politically and strategically. Stalin angrily said: "The Anglo-American attack on North Africa cannot be regarded as the second front." Therefore, this operation has further reduced the ability to transport aid materials to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In the past, the Casablanca talks did not see the participation of the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek both called it a meaningless meeting. Although the people who participated in the talks appeared serious, the content was empty. The internal strife of the French rebel army in North Africa has not yet subsided. The Casablanca talks were of no avail. (Xiang: Translated from the February 13th Continental News)</p>
<h3>A Tour of the New Guinea Front – American and Australian Troops, Souls Lost and Spirits Broken, Groaning in the Jungle</h3>
<p>The jungle warfare in the Guadalcanal and New Guinea areas has been going on day and night for half a year. It has left the American and Australian troops with lost souls and broken spirits. According to a dispatch from the capital of Argentina, a correspondent for the American magazine "Time" on the New Guinea front wrote the following report, thoroughly exposing the fact that the American and Australian troops have been defeated.</p>
<p>Around ○○ and ○○ north of the Kumusi River, smoke fills the sky and the sound of gunfire is constant, indicating fierce fighting. Although this is a tropical area with scorching sunlight, under the jungle with towering trees, only grass and trees can be seen, and the sunlight is never visible. The foul odor that blows in from all directions is unbearable. The American and Australian troops are resisting the fierce attacks of the brave Japanese army day and night.</p>
<p>Bloody Battle All Around</p>
<p>Trucks painted with green protective paint are overturned one by one on the side of the road. Many American soldiers are seriously injured, their blood dripping and congealing into clots. Every part of the green uniforms they wear is covered in mud and has turned gray. Some soldiers have faces swollen from insect bites, some are emaciated because they cannot fight without supplies, and some are suffering from tropical fevers and cannot get up. This is truly a living hell on earth.</p>
<p>The Japanese army has built many and very strong fortifications all around. Strong fortresses can be seen everywhere. The American and Australian troops are fighting in this grass, trees, and forest. The Japanese army is extremely brave and uses one company of soldiers to defeat a large detachment of American troops. In other words, the Japanese army only needs one large detachment of soldiers to defeat one division of American troops.</p>
<p>Dampness Hinders Movement</p>
<p>The ground here is damp. If you are not careful and lose your footing, you will be stuck deep in the mud. Small ditches and large beaches are everywhere, making it simply impossible to pass through. It is truly not easy for the American and Australian troops to fight in such difficult and arduous conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the positions occupied by the Japanese army are very cleverly constructed. The brave spirit of the Japanese army is worthy of admiration. In order to break through the Japanese army's positions, they have to advance through a hail of bullets. However, the result is not only unsuccessful, but also leads to losses and setbacks. The corpses of American and Australian soldiers are piled up all over the ground.</p>
<p>Breaking away from the scope of modern warfare, hand-to-hand combat has broken out everywhere. Ingeniously constructed modern weapons are not of much use. The situation of the battle is more intense than anyone expected. The American and Australian troops encountered such a fierce battle and began to realize that war is not just about weapons, but must have a spirit of hard work that will not give up despite repeated setbacks.

<h3>Germany's Civil Mobilization Proceeds Smoothly – Many Non-Essential Businesses Close One After Another – Many Periodicals Will Also Cease Publication</h3>
<p>Berlin, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: The civil mobilization plan is proceeding very smoothly. Luxury goods stores, luxurious restaurants, dance halls, and bars in Berlin have all closed one after another. In addition, porcelain shops, fashion stores, jewelry stores, and art dealers will also be announced to close soon. Automobile showrooms will naturally be affected by the mobilization order, as they cannot sell automobiles to private individuals during wartime. It is estimated that 100,000 businesses in Berlin alone will close due to the new mobilization order. It is reported that 400 female employees from a major department store and 900 female employees from other companies will be transferred to work as ticket sellers on public vehicles in Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: It was learned here yesterday that Germany will suspend the publication of many periodicals in order to mobilize manpower for total war. Publications of the same nature will be merged for publication, and publications on luxury living will be prohibited. Unimportant magazines such as stamp collecting are also on the list of publications to be suspended. However, magazines on gardening, beekeeping, and other similar topics will still be allowed to be published. Among the 4,000 kinds of publications on art, science, fashion, and social issues, only 2,500 will be allowed to continue publishing. However, this number will be further reduced in the future. Publications that are allowed to be published must reduce their number of pages and the number of copies printed, and extend the period of publication.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Forces Sweep Through Croatia, Eliminating Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Zagreb, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: It was learned here yesterday that the German, Italian, and Croatian forces continue to win victories in their sweep of guerrillas in southern Croatia. The German and Croatian forces drove the mixed forces into the mountains in the central Sana River area of western Bosnia. Most of the territory in southern Bosnia has been recovered. The Croatian forces have also crossed the lower reaches of the Una River, penetrating into the northwest of the Grmeč Mountains, eliminating the guerrillas' base. The residents welcomed the troops wherever they went. Villages where the guerrillas were entrenched were reduced to ruins, and Muslim residents suffered the most.</p>
<p>Zagreb, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: More than one million kuna has been raised here to aid the families of Croatian soldiers who died in Stalingrad.</p>
<h3>Stalemate on the Tunisian Front – Only Italian Air Force Bombs Bougie Port</h3>
<p>World News Agency, February 12th, Havas News Agency, Switzerland: According to news from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, the fighting on the Tunisian front is still limited to local warfare due to the cold weather. The German side claims that the Anglo-American Allied Command is taking advantage of the stalemate on the front to reorganize its forces, and has transferred General Jiloy's subordinates to the rear on the pretext that they need to be re-equipped before the battle. The Anglo-American forces' attempt to encircle the advanced positions of the Axis forces in northern Tunisia has been cleared. The Anglo-American side stated that the Allied forces attacked northern Tunisia at dawn on the 9th of this month and advanced about eight miles to the east. General Montgomery's 7th Armored Division advanced to the Béja-Tébessa road intersection. The battle in the Matouks area has ended. In addition, according to news from Berlin, the enemy's actions in southern Tunisia are limited to small-scale offensives. Attacks near the city of Gafsa have been easily repelled. As for the air forces of both sides, they are not very active due to the bad weather. Italian aircraft bombed the facilities at Bougie Port in Algeria. Two British aircraft were shot down in the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Rome, February 13th, Central News Agency: The Italian Military Headquarters announced on the afternoon of the 12th that the Italian Air Force braved the bad weather on the Tunisian front to attack Bougie Port, fiercely bombing the harbor facilities there. The German Air Force also shot down two enemy aircraft between Rhodes and Crete.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: The former Governor of Algeria, Chatel, arrived here yesterday and will travel to London. He is carrying important documents from General Liold to General Tegor.</p>
<h3>Allied Diplomats Stationed in France Have Been Moved to a Location in Germany – Germany Adopted This Measure Based on American Precedent</h3>
<p>Berlin, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: The German Foreign Ministry today revealed for the first time the fate of the Allied diplomats and consuls who remained in the unoccupied zone of France when German troops occupied it. It is said that the Allied diplomats and consuls have now been moved to a famous health resort in Germany, living together in a hotel. Germany adopted this measure based on American precedent in preparation for an exchange. The United States had previously requested that German diplomats and consuls stationed in South American countries who wished to return home should first go to the United States to wait for an exchange. In addition, when the British and Americans occupied French North and West Africa, the German consuls stationed in Morocco and Algeria were first taken to England by the British and American authorities and then moved to another location. Therefore, Germany is now taking the same action in southern France, detaining diplomats and consuls from countries that are at war with or have severed relations with Germany. However, it is paying close attention to their living conditions, hygiene, and diet. However, the United States did not treat German diplomats well. Only after requests were made did it provide the same treatment. As for the exchange negotiations, it is not yet possible to announce the date.</p>

<h3>Italian Submarine Establishes Distinguished Merits</h3>
<p>Lufon, February 13th, Central News Agency: An Italian submarine has returned to an Italian naval port today after establishing distinguished merits. It is reported that during its patrol, the submarine sank 18 anti-Axis ships, including one cruiser, four oil tankers, and thirteen merchant ships, totaling 110,000 tons. The sunken merchant ships were all fully loaded with military supplies, materials, cotton, and rubber.</p>
<h3>Italian Factories Will Employ Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Rome, February 13th, Huitong News Agency: Gaida stated in the Italian newspaper that Italian factories will employ prisoners of war. The Minister of the Army and the Minister of Labor are studying this matter.</p>
<h3>Italian Side Refutes Pravda's Remarks</h3>
<p>Rome, February 13th, Havas News Agency: The Soviet newspaper Pravda recently published an article stating that Bessarabia and the Balkan countries are all part of the Soviet Union. This statement has been refuted by the Italian radio station, which believes that this statement is completely inaccurate. The Soviet Union needs these countries as bases for attacking Western Europe. Therefore, the true purpose of the Soviet Union lies in occupying the Balkan Peninsula and the Scandinavian Peninsula. It is difficult for us to believe in the mild promises provided by Stalin. Although the situation is clear as a bell, England and America are still supporting the Red Army, which is simply opening a path for communism.</p>

<h3>German Counteroffensive Northwest of the Donets River; Preventing Soviet Advances Towards the Sea of Azov; Soviet Attempts to Cut Off Rostov's Rear Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – German forces are holding the northwest region of the Donets River basin and launching counteroffensives to prevent Soviet forces from advancing from the central Donets River basin towards Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Soviet forces have been forced to divide their troops to encircle from the southwest, but Soviet advances from the Izium area towards Zaporozhye on the Dnieper River have so far been unsuccessful. The Soviets have only occupied the railway hub northwest of Izium, and the Germans have already begun their counteroffensive. The southward advance of Soviet forces will increasingly feel the pressure from German forces on their left flank. Soviet attacks north of Kursk towards Orel have been unsuccessful. There are no changes in the situation at Belgorod. Soviet advances towards Kharkov have met with strong German resistance. The situation is quiet along the lower reaches of the Donets and Don Rivers. The Soviets are reinforcing their troops who landed southwest of Novorossiysk from the Black Sea. The German forces holding the bridgehead between Krasnodar and Novorossiysk still maintain combat effectiveness and offensive capabilities. Although Soviet forces have launched multi-pronged attacks in the Lake Ladoga area, these are only minor engagements.</p>
<p>German Defenses Increasingly Consolidated</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Military sources here claim that the German defense lines on the Eastern Front are becoming increasingly consolidated. The focus of the fighting remains in the areas of Kursk and Belgorod, and west of Oskol. Soviet forces launched fierce attacks in the aforementioned two areas yesterday, but were repulsed and suffered heavy losses in soldiers and equipment. Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga also attacked with the aid of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, but were also repulsed. The Soviet forces at Leningrad launched an offensive several days ago, but have so far failed to break the siege of Leningrad.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency) – Soviet troops are currently besieging Rostov from three directions, while German forces are holding firm in the Donets River basin coal mining area. A portion of the Soviet forces is encircling Mariupol on the Sea of Azov from Izium in the central Donets River, hoping to cut off Rostov's rear. The remaining troops are attacking from the northeast and southeast. Moscow admits that German resistance is very strong. Soviet troops are also conducting encirclement operations in the Kharkov area. Although Moscow claims to have made progress, Berlin denies this.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Allied News Agency Urgent Telegram) – The German High Command announced today that German forces have withdrawn from Krasnodar, an important railway hub in western Caucasus. Krasnodar is located about 100 kilometers northwest of the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk and is a major railway junction, with one line connecting to Rostov about 300 kilometers to the north.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A special correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun in Berlin reports that Germany's main task in its upcoming third spring offensive will be to weaken the enemy's strength. The withdrawal from the Caucasus and the fierce fighting along the Donets are all part of this strategy, so the gain or loss of territory is only of secondary importance.</p>
<p>Soviet Losses</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed sources claim that Soviet forces lost a total of 60 aircraft and 90 tanks on the Eastern Front on Thursday.</p>
<p>Soviet Appointments</p>
<p>Ankara, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Moscow reports that the Soviet High Command has recently appointed Zhdanov and Cherushevich as Lieutenant Generals. Zhdanov is Stalin's party representative and holds important positions such as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Germany Issues Decree for Occupied Territories</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German government announced a new administrative decree for the occupied territories in the Soviet Union on the 12th. The main points are as follows: (1) Abolish the communist institutions established during the Soviet period and restore the European system. (2) Open up the Soviet collective farms and return the farmland to ordinary poor farmers. (3) During the transitional period, these collective farms will be temporarily organized as joint cooperatives. In the future, the farmland will be gradually returned to the farmers, depending on their efficiency. (4) This agricultural institutional reform system can be applied throughout Ukraine and Belarus.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Active Over the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command announced the following details of the German Air Force's activity on the Eastern Front on the 13th: (1) The German Air Force repeatedly bombed Soviet troops and their transport lines on the central and southern fronts, destroying 15 large enemy tanks and over 300 other vehicles. (2) The German Air Force, which is currently active on the northern front, also heavily bombed Soviet positions and their air bases south of Lake Ladoga and near Lake Ilmen. A German Air Force unit shot down 29 Soviet aircraft in that area.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Soviet-Finnish Peace Negotiations Abound; Allegedly, the British Ambassador to Sweden Carries a Mission to Persuade Finland to Make Peace</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The Swedish Minister to Britain, Prytz, arrived here from London yesterday. Prytz's sudden return to the country has surprised many, causing long-dormant rumors of a separate Soviet-Finnish peace agreement to resurface, suggesting that Prytz's return carries a mission to persuade Finland to seek peace with the Soviets. Since the start of the war, Britain has viewed Finland in much the same way as Bulgaria during World War I, resorting to all sorts of tricks to wage a psychological war against it. The British do not harbor any particular animosity towards Finland, but they wish to detach Finland from the Axis powers, believing that doing so would cause the Axis to collapse. Regarding the rumors about a separate Soviet-Finnish peace agreement spread by the British press, British authorities have not commented on the matter, only stating that Britain is not directly interested in matters that are primarily related to the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards the matter, it has remained ostensibly silent in recent days. However, important figures in the Soviet Union have told British and American representatives that the Soviet Union respects Finland's independence in principle. Therefore, neutral diplomats may also have learned of these remarks. It is also very possible that the Swedish Minister Prytz will report what he has heard to the Swedish Foreign Ministry upon his return. Responsible authorities in London have not made any statements on the matter so far, and the process must rely on direct contact between Moscow and Helsinki, so the possibility of a separate Soviet-Finnish peace agreement is actually very slim.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – American newspapers have published news that the Swedish Minister to Britain will return to Stockholm to mediate between the Soviet Union and Finland. Swedish authorities have denied this, deeming it completely unfounded, but confirming that the Swedish Minister to Britain will visit Stockholm.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Gansu</h3>
<p>— Ju Jin</p>
<p>The most striking thing is the poverty of the people of Gansu Province. The places we passed by car, apart from a very few county towns, were almost all people with tattered clothes and gaunt faces. The elderly were able to wear coarse clothes, but young children, both boys and girls, were naked everywhere. Seeing this situation, we were naturally extremely saddened.</p>
<p>What is the reason for the suffering of the people of Gansu? According to analysis, there are several reasons: The people of Gansu rely on the heavens for their livelihood, but the heavens are really unreliable. If there is a lucky downpour, there can be a bumper harvest for a year, but the result of a bumper harvest is only about 70% or 80% of a normal year. However, because of the limitations of the weather and geography in Gansu, there are very few years of bumper harvest, so the people have never had a full year's worth of food. If they can't even get enough to eat, how can they afford clothes? Therefore, the people are always living in poverty, and this is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The second reason is the excessive tax burden. This was especially true during the era of warlord rule, and even in the present situation, there is still room for improvement. I remember once when a reporter went to see Gu Zhenglun, Gu said: In some areas of Gansu Province, the people are burdened by excessive taxes, and because they cannot get enough to eat twice a day, they often abandon their fields and flee with their wives, children, and elderly. Stories like these are often heard. Therefore, the provincial authorities are now working hard to find ways to reduce the suffering of the people and help them increase agricultural production. One of the measures is to provide loans to farmers, but because the people have not received much education, this cannot be implemented smoothly.</p>
<p>The reporter witnessed the situation between the Hui and Han people in Lanzhou. The reporter's impression is that the Muslims are obedient people. No matter what they do, the Muslims are always at the forefront. The reporter once chatted with Mayor Cai about the situation of the Muslims, and Cai praised them greatly. He cited the example that when he ordered the citizens to demolish houses and build roads, the Muslims were the only ones who obeyed the order first, demolished their houses, and set a very good example. There are many stories like this, but this is just one fact. After writing about the current situation in Gansu, the reporter would like to offer a few thoughts to conclude this report.</p>
<p>First, the people's lives are too difficult, and those in power should make reducing the people's suffering and increasing their welfare the main priority of their administration.</p>
<p>Second, education is too underdeveloped. It can be said that there are very few institutions of higher learning in Gansu, and even the middle and primary schools, as well as national schools, are not up to standard. Therefore, universal education is an urgent matter for developing the Northwest.</p>
<p>Third, there is a great lack of talent. The lack of talent is a common phenomenon in Gansu Province and other provinces in the Northwest. There is a lot of work to be done in Gansu and other parts of the Northwest, but there are too few people to do it. At this conference of engineers in Lanzhou, we saw slogans on the streets such as "Engineers, stay in the Northwest!" etc., which fully demonstrate the lack of talent in the provinces of the Northwest. How to transfer talent from various departments to the Northwest to undertake development work is something that deserves attention from all parties. (Published January 10, 1943)</p>
<h3>Soviet Chamber of Commerce Established in Palestine</h3>
<p>Ankara, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A dispatch from Jerusalem states that a Soviet Chamber of Commerce is about to be established there. Branches of the chamber will soon be established in other parts of Palestine. According to Soviet sources, the Soviet Union also plans to establish consulates in Jerusalem, Damascus, and Beirut.</p>
<h3>Key Points of British Prime Minister Churchill's Report to the House of Commons; Content Mostly Relates to Submarine Warfare</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A German political report states that the political report presented by Churchill in the House of Commons mostly concerns the issue of submarine warfare. There are four main points: (1) The losses at sea for the Allies are very large. Britain cannot ignore the loss of ships and cargo, and must consider the safety of sailors. (2) The British government believes the losses are significant and cannot publish the figures due to public opinion. (3) Building a new ship is not as good as protecting the safety of an old ship. After some sailors die, manpower is lacking and difficult to replenish. (4) Whether Britain and the United States can continue to supply the Soviet Union with arms and whether they have the strength to open new fronts depends on whether the new ships can make up for the losses of the old ships. Churchill also announced the results of the Casablanca Conference, with six main points: (1) Britain and the United States have different views on the overall war situation and strategy. Churchill and Roosevelt agreed that solving the transportation problem is important and that studying strategies to counter German submarines is an urgent task. (2) The agreement signed by both sides is only valid for nine months. Churchill and Roosevelt plan to meet again within nine months. (3) Stalin was unwilling to participate in the Churchill-Roosevelt meeting, and even if Roosevelt was willing to travel to Khartoum for a meeting, Stalin was unwilling to agree. (4) Roosevelt stated that he feared that Britain would soon lose interest in the Pacific theater. Churchill stated that once the European war is over, he will send troops to the east, but an agreement can only be reached with the consent of the wartime cabinet. (5) Churchill admitted that Britain is currently not participating in the war against Japan. (6) The United States requested that Britain and Chongqing be subject to the command of US General Arnold and decide on military operations. Britain has accepted this and has therefore sent Sir Dill to Chongqing and ordered General Wavell to meet with General MacArthur. Churchill finally reported on the main points of the Adana Conference: (1) Britain promised to do its best to help Turkey strengthen its military strength so that it can resist foreign aggression. (2) Observations on the Adana Conference communique should be based on its content and should not be far-fetched. (In other words, Turkey has not signed a new agreement with Britain). In summary, there are no significant new developments in British military, political, and diplomatic affairs, and there is nothing to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>British Press Dissatisfied with Prime Minister's Remarks</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – When British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons on the 11th, he still gave an optimistic report on the threat of German submarines, which seems to have caused dissatisfaction from all parties. According to a dispatch from London, on the 12th, the British newspapers launched a major attack on Churchill's attitude of still trying to conceal the truth from the public, believing that although Churchill expressed confidence in the tactics for dealing with submarines, the activity of German submarines is still the biggest threat to Britain and the United States. The situation is serious and clearly not optimistic.</p>
<p>Submarine Threat Will Become More Severe</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New York, US Admiral Pratt published an article in "Newsweek" offering various suggestions on eliminating the threat of submarines. He said that the Casablanca Conference confirmed that the threat of submarines is still very serious. Since Admiral Doenitz was appointed as the German Naval Minister, submarine activity is about to intensify. Germany is now fully committed to cutting off the Allied sea lanes, of which the most important and most vulnerable to submarine attacks is the route from the United States to North Africa and through Gibraltar. Allied convoys lack air cover during their voyages and rely solely on the protection of escort warships. Therefore, Pratt advocated using airships for protection.</p>
<h3>Wartime National Life of Various Countries (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ryoichi Ishii, Translated by Shizuko</p>
<p>Germany, Italy, America, England, Germany</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Germany's food situation is visibly improving. Although it can be said that Germany had a firm grip on the granary of all of Europe after the start of the war, because it had to take responsibility for the food of not only its own people but also the residents of all occupied areas, it had no choice but to moderately reduce their food rations. Foreign laborers and prisoners from countries such as Poland and the Soviet Union were also put to work in agricultural production to increase the food supply. The domestic and eastern occupied areas had an unexpectedly abundant harvest this year, leading to an announcement to increase bread and meat rations starting from October 19th. Furthermore, there was a special allocation for Christmas, with food as a gift. Initially, the increased bread ration was 250 grams per person per week, at a time when the ration set by the voucher system was 2,250 grams. The meat ration increased by 50 grams per person per week, totaling 350 grams. For laborers working long hours and at night, an additional 50 grams were specially allocated, totaling an increase of 100 grams, which was greatly appreciated by the average worker. However, the most critical issue for Germany in terms of food remains fats. The combined weekly ration of butter, lard, margarine, and cooking oil for the average standard consumer is only 206 grams, which is a decrease from the previous 269 grams. Due to the increased planting of oilseed plants this year, the supply of oils and fats might increase. Cheese, sugar, jam, and wheat flour have also been put under rationing. However, the supply of raw materials such as bread grains and potatoes is very abundant, especially this year's particularly bountiful potato harvest, so the weekly ration has been set at 2,500 grams per person, and it is even possible to buy quantities exceeding this limit at small grocery stores. All of the above can only be purchased with ration cards. In addition, vegetables, fruits, chicken, eggs, and fresh fish can be purchased without ration cards, as the shortage of vegetables and fruits can be made up for with imports from Italy. However, eggs, especially in large cities like Berlin, average only about three to five per month. Adults can be allocated one-eighth of a liter of milk per day (Liter). To buy milk, individuals simply need to apply to the milk company themselves. However, laborers working long hours and at night, patients, pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, and children are all allocated their full needs.</p>
<p>As for luxury items, coffee is rationed. Because there is no tea, substitutes are used entirely. Alcoholic beverages are not included in the rationing system and can be bought and drunk freely, but in reality, there is not enough. Therefore, people who enjoy drinking in cities often travel to places where less alcohol is consumed, but are restricted by transportation. So, it's a compromise, which is the same as nothing. So, not only alcohol but also milk, butter, bread, cigarettes, and other daily necessities are subject to the same restrictions. Germany also has the same squeezing to buy as Japan's shopping. Germany restricted these kinds of goods long time ago. Due to a lack of raw materials, only about 125 grams of snacks and sugar are allocated per person every four to six weeks.</p>
<p>Regarding clothing, the third clothing ration card has 120 points, a 20% reduction from the previous 150 points. The validity period of the ration card has been extended by four months, from one year previously to sixteen months this time. Starting in January this year, due to the decrease in civilian consumer products, the fourth allocation of points has been further reduced to 100 points. The validity period is eighteen months (extended by two months). For children, three-piece suits remain at 80 points, outerwear at 90 points, socks at 8 points, and collared shirts at 24 points. This certainly cannot be considered excessive consumption. According to the fourth allocation of clothing ration points, the amount of men's clothing and apparel materials has been reduced below the required quantity, so special allocation permits must be issued separately. Men's and women's winter outerwear are not allocated based on clothing ration cards but based on special permits. Shoes used to require special permits but now still use ration cards. However, because workers in factories or engaged in agriculture have different circumstances, they require a larger quantity of clothing, so soap and work clothes are subject to a special allocation system.</p>
<p>As for soap, ordinary people are allocated one small bar of scented soap and 250 grams of washing soap per month. Infants under two years old receive an additional 100 grams of high-quality soap, 500 grams of soap. Children under eight years old receive an additional 500 grams of soap powder. Other patients, doctors, and hospitals receive special allocations. Laundries also have specific soap ration cards. One pair of leather shoes is allocated per year, but because they are made of substitutes, they are not very durable. When unavoidable, people have to buy wooden shoes to wear. Since this spring, cigarettes have also been rationed. Adults receive approximately five to six cigarettes per day, which is of course not enough. Many smokers have therefore quit smoking, which coincides with the authorities' intention. The allocation for women is only half that of men.</p>
<p>The lives of the German people in this way can be said to be very tight, but when we look at the other side, rather than saying that there is a lack of materials itself, it is more like deliberately placing the daily lives of the people in a state of insufficiency, in order to strive for the final victory of a long-term war. This may be a deep intention of the government authorities, and it is also deeply understood by the people of the whole country, so there is absolutely no complaint. Therefore, the life of the people of the whole country can maintain stability for a long time, and the rise in prices has only risen to 5% since the start of the war.</p>
<p>To save fuel, the summer time was abolished again from November 2nd, and the working hours were also changed to save electricity consumed in the morning and evening. Due to environmental reasons, there is also work on Sundays. However, 80% of Germany's electricity production is generated by thermal power, so it is necessary to save civilian consumption as much as possible for military needs. At the same time, to save gasoline, alternative fuels have long been used. The Military Supplies Department promoted the conversion to alternative fuel vehicles, saying: "If private automobile operators do not convert to alternative fuels within a certain period, the permit for gasoline (Renzine) and diesel (Diesel) allocation will be revoked." In terms of transportation, all passenger trains are also reorganized and merged, and dining cars are abolished. Sleeping cars are also limited to those with public affairs needs. As for the transportation of other non-essential goods, it is of course also abolished.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Italy's food self-sufficiency rate before the war reached 95%, which is considered more prosperous than other belligerent countries. However, in order to supply food and labor to Germany, a rationing system was implemented shortly after the start of the war. Its rations are: 150 grams of bread per person per day, 125 grams of meat per week, 300 grams of olive oil, and 100 grams of butter. The rations for laborers are naturally more, and patients are also specially allocated. However, compared to before the war, this ration seems to be insufficient, but the daily caloric needs of the Italian people are only 3,000, so as long as this measure can be maintained, it is not a problem. Since last winter, laborers have been specially allocated bread. At the same time, a large number of potatoes were imported from Germany, so since December, residents in large cities have also been specially allocated potatoes. Fruits, vegetables, and cheese can be purchased without restrictions. However, because these foods must also be supplied to Germany, there are still regulations on proper consumption. Therefore, in order to increase food production, wastelands before the war have been actively reclaimed this year.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of clothing and items used around the body, substitutes are used uniformly. Clothing has been subject to a ration card system since November of the year before last. The points are divided into five categories: male, female, boy, girl, and infant. Every year, each person has 120 points for men and 95 points for women, of which one-third cannot be used again every four months. Men's clothing is 75 points, coats are 80 points, shirts are 10 points, handkerchiefs are 3 points, and leather shoes are 80 points. Women's clothing is only 60 points, so if you replace a brand new set of clothes, you can't even buy a handkerchief in the next four months. Soap is not subject to rationing restrictions, but soap is a prescribed format item. The size of teacups and teapots are prescribed a so-called wartime standard model in order to unify them. Other daily necessities are also gradually standardized. The people want to operate their simple wartime lives within the specifications. In order to save labor and raw materials, the production of children's toys has been completely prohibited since October 12, and sales have been prohibited since March this year.</p>
<p>Due to consumption restrictions on paper, electricity, and gas, the number of pages in newspapers has also gradually decreased. To save fuel, the number of trams running has also decreased accordingly. Gas is supplied three times a day, for a total of only five hours. The pressure has also been reduced to 85% of pre-war levels. The allocation of coal for indoor heating will also be reduced. Private cars have also been abolished. Substitute trucks are limited to five liters per day, and public trucks are allocated only ten liters of gasoline per month. The regulations for so-called substitute cars are also very strict. Only patients or people with emergencies are allowed to ride. It is almost impossible for ordinary people. All residences or materials are given priority for military needs. Restrictions on civilian needs are extremely strict. However, the people of Italy can be said to have no complaints at all. This really shows that the people of Italy absolutely believe in their Prime Minister Mussolini and will achieve final victory. Therefore, there is no such thing as a black market in the entire country of Italy, and the will of the people is growing stronger day by day.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Delivers Speech, Vigorously Denounces Defeatists at Home, Welles Urges Allied Post-War Cooperation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong Agency) - President Roosevelt delivered a radio address last night, lasting forty minutes. He initially vigorously denounced defeatists and skeptics in the country, because the existence of these people causes American troops overseas to be very concerned about the situation at home. Roosevelt continued that when he recently traveled to various places for inspection, he found that some people in the United States were dissatisfied with everything, especially with the measures to control materials and the wage system. When discussing the concerns of American soldiers overseas about their future occupations, Roosevelt claimed that this was not worth worrying about, because the government would do its best to restore their past occupations. When necessary, Congress should legislate to stipulate it. Now, the British and American armies and the French split forces are preparing to launch "the largest battle in this war" in Tunisia. At that time, the British army and Tegor's army will attack from the south, while the British and American armies and the French army under General Giraud will jointly attack from the west. The matters discussed at the Casablanca Conference include military plans around the world. Before the Allies attack Europe, the battle of Tunisia should be decided first. Roosevelt finally quoted Churchill, saying that the war in Europe should first seek victory, and then the entire British army can calmly fight elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong Agency) - New York dispatch, Deputy Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech on the first day of "Allied Nations Month," warning the Allied countries not to fall into fighting at the end of the war. It is said that the most tragic thing after the war is that countries are in a position of opposition in commerce and finance, which hinders the establishment of international prosperity. The Atlantic Charter has detailed regulations on the handling of the post-war period, it is said. British Ambassador to the United States Halifax also delivered a speech on the same day, believing that the Allied countries must abandon all prejudices and implement genuine cooperation.</p>
<h3>German Commentary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong Agency) - Political figures here commented on Roosevelt's speech yesterday, saying that Roosevelt's statement that a large-scale military operation would be launched had been repeatedly mentioned by senior officials of the United Kingdom and the United States, and was not new. Roosevelt said that the Allies will attack Europe this year, we really have nothing to fear. "Tank warriors," what do we fear. Regarding Roosevelt's threat to Japan, people here believe that in terms of the Japanese army's combat power, it is really Roosevelt's dream.</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Bill to Abolish Consular Jurisdiction in China</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong Agency) - According to Washington, the US Senate unanimously passed the treaty to abolish consular jurisdiction in China yesterday. The case was proposed by Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<h3>Soviet Officers Fly Over Brazil</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong Agency) - Reuters London dispatch said that four generals under General Timoshenko and one Soviet naval general flew over Natal, Brazil. However, the dispatch did not mention the destination of the Soviet officers.</p>
<h3>Iranian Cabinet Resigns En Masse, Established for Less Than Three Weeks</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital, 13th (Havas Agency) - The Iranian Cabinet, established for less than three weeks, was heard to have resigned en masse today. The reason is dissatisfaction with the law passed by the parliament, which stipulates that the central bank is controlled by the parliament. According to the original Iranian central bank, it was directly under the Ministry of Finance and had an American advisor.</p>

<h3>Daily Necessities Suddenly Rise in Price, Metered Rations Will Be Considered, Merchant Monopoly Becomes More Obvious, Intervention Must Be Used to Maintain the Market</h3>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, the prices of various items have been rising overtly and covertly, especially the various daily necessities. For example, the price of soap and matches. When the initial price was quoted, each box of wood sold for 840 yuan, but yesterday (13th) it was sold for 920 yuan, a huge increase of 80 yuan. The price increase of other brands of soap is completely the same. The price of Phoenix brand matches was 4,400 yuan. After the price increase suddenly started, it soared by 1,000 yuan in one day. Yesterday (13th), it was sold for 5,800 yuan, and the beautiful brand was sold for 6,000 yuan. The severity of the price increase can be called unprecedented. This situation has a huge impact on the lives of citizens, so the relevant authorities in this city will severely intervene. The following are the various situations recently inquired by the Commercial News reporter.</p>
<p>Soap and Matches Have Been Manipulated</p>
<p>According to people in the industry who told the Commercial News reporter, although the recent sudden rise in soap and match prices is generally due to the depletion of stocks and no new goods being produced, prices naturally rise under the principle of scarcity, but the degree of the rise should not be as severe as it is today. At present, the match price increase is only limited to two brands, Phoenix and Beauty. The price increase of other brands, such as Golden Tripod, is relatively limited. It is obvious that the match price increase is not entirely due to panic about material. Instead, it is manipulated by a small number of merchants. When the manipulation reaches its peak, the market transactions today are extremely cold. The prices of goods are too high, and buyers dare not even inquire. Sellers want to hoard goods and ask for sky-high prices. Both the buying and selling sides are in a state of paralysis.</p>
<p>Maintaining People's Livelihood, Quickly Plan Good Policies</p>
<p>It is also learned that the authorities are paying close attention to the recent soaring prices of soap and matches. In order to stabilize the market and protect the people's livelihood, they will strictly crack down on this abnormal phenomenon. At the same time, all parties are deeply concerned about the metered allocation of daily necessities. The fundamental countermeasure to prevent illegal merchants from hoarding daily necessities is to implement the metered allocation of practical goods, similar to the metered allocation of grain. At present, daily necessities such as matches, soap, salt, and sugar have been implemented successively in various places along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line. It is also necessary to implement it in this city as soon as possible, so the authorities have begun to consider this.</p>
<p>Investigating Inventory</p>
<p>Now, the local authorities in this city are seeking to fully allocate materials and eliminate speculation and profiteering, and hoarding for profit and other bad habits. In addition to actively seeking to circulate material sources from various parts of the country, they are also investigating the amount of existing materials in various industry companies and merchants, such as food, edible oil, cotton yarn, sugar, cigarettes, candles, fuel, matches, caustic soda, leather, wine, seasonings, copper, tin, ironware, Guangdong goods, various papers, building timber, industrial drugs, wood, rubber, electrical materials, enamelware, porcelain, etc., which will be ordered to be filled in by the industry association according to the format for verification, and to prepare for a rainy day to avoid the panic of shortages.</p>
<p>Cash Transactions</p>
<p>Transactions in various industry markets have now been approved by the authorities to resume business. With the approval of the authorities, various industry associations have successively discussed and formulated the rules for selling and buying in the market by the same industry under the supervision of the authorities. All representatives entering the market must show their entry permits. Transactions in the market must issue a transaction note. At the same time, spot and futures of various goods are strictly prohibited from being sold to non-industry people. However, since the various markets resumed business, black market transactions still occur occasionally, which has a significant impact on the commercial market and the selling prices of goods. Now it is learned that the authorities are deeply concerned about the transactions in various industries, and have dispatched personnel to monitor the markets for several days and report the market conditions in a list. Those who engage in illegal transactions will be arrested.</p>
<p>Evaluation Work</p>
<p>The various industry associations in this port, in order to assist the authorities in thoroughly stabilizing prices, have successively established "Commodity Evaluation Committees" to engage in evaluation work. The organization is quite meticulous. When ordered to specify the price limit of a certain commodity in detail, they will first notify the members, list this commodity and the cost, etc., and send it to the association, and then convene an evaluation committee meeting to jointly discuss and formulate a standard price limit, and then submit a document to the authorities for verification. After approval, they will print the evaluation list and distribute it to the industry peers of each association for uniform compliance. Now it is learned that all industries are making every effort to carry out this work. Recently, in view of the fact that department store prices have risen again to a peak, becoming a reason for promoting high commodity prices, which is related to the lives of citizens, attention has been paid to it.</p>
<p>Planned Increase in Production</p>
<p>The authorities, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood, suppress and stabilize prices, crack down on speculation and hoarding, and strictly implement price limits, are prohibiting all commodities from being illegally bought and sold, and the various industries have set up a price review committee to evaluate the price and submit it to the authorities for approval before issuing it according to the limit. Do not arbitrarily raise or change the grade, as well as other improper behaviors. Afterwards, if it is necessary to change the price due to cost reasons, the industry association may submit reasons to request a change. In addition, it is forbidden to wholesale the goods operated to members of non-industry associations. To solve the problem fundamentally, it is planned to increase the production of daily and industrial products so that there will be no feeling of lack. Daily industrial products such as cotton yarn, cloth, flour, vegetable oil, matches, soap, candles, and paper are particularly urgent to increase production. Now, every effort is being made to restore the original factories, unblock the sources of raw materials, or find substitutes, or seek new inventions, and strive to achieve practical results as a fundamental solution to reducing the selling price of daily necessities. Establish an agency for the raw materials of the above-mentioned necessities, unify the collection and implement the allocation system, and verify and allocate them according to the production capacity and actual needs of each factory. The goods produced by each factory with the allocated raw materials must be wholesaled to retail merchants according to the specified price limit, and those who violate the regulations will be permanently suspended from raw material allocation and punished.</p>
<h3>Stores Excuse Themselves to Close Early, Authorities Seriously Take Action</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been learned that some stores have shortened business hours for various reasons, or intentionally evaded regulations, cleverly used "holidays" or "repairing houses" and other things, and closed early to stop business, stingy to sell goods, and tried to jointly raise prices to earn extra profits. The authorities believe that such actions have reached the peak of monopoly and hoarding for speculation. If they are not dealt with strictly, how can the market be maintained, and there are very deep considerations on how to deal with it.</p>

<h3>Insurance Supervisory Bureau Director Inspects Insurance Businesses in Various Locations</h3>
<p>In order to safeguard the legitimate interests of the insurance industry and to strictly prohibit illegal operations that endanger society, the Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industries requires all insurance companies in the city to apply for registration with the Bureau. Of the eighty-six companies that have applied, forty to fifty have been reviewed and approved for registration and business licenses. The remaining forty-odd companies are currently under review.

<h3>After Discovering a Homicide, People Should Report to Multiple Parties to Cooperatively Apprehend the Perpetrator Swiftly</h3>
<p>Recently, a robbery and murder occurred at a watch shop on North Sichuan Road in this city, and similar incidents have also occurred in the International Settlement. Considering that even though those who discover such incidents can quickly report to the relevant authorities and cooperate in arresting the perpetrators, the communication and notification are not yet perfect. Therefore, the local garrison authorities have called for attention, hoping that in the future, residents, upon discovering a homicide, should report to the relevant authorities separately, one by one, in order to quickly capture the criminals and maintain security. In the past, those who discovered a homicide or a criminal often thought that reporting to only one relevant authority was sufficient. In fact, for more active and closer communication in order to arrest the criminals as soon as possible, anyone who discovers such an incident should make every effort to report separately to relevant parties, such as the Municipal Government Police Bureau, Marines, Military Police, Consulate, Police of the Public Works Department, and local self-defense corps, to assist in the arrest.</p>
<h3>To Avoid Profiteering by Brokers, the Social Bureau Director Ling Expresses Hope That All Industries Will Organize Associations Soon</h3>
<p>Director Ling of the Social Bureau Gives a Speech</p>
<p>Recently, prices of all commodities in this city have suddenly risen sharply again. This matter is of utmost importance to people's livelihoods. Director Ling of the Shanghai Social Bureau made the following remarks: "Recently, general commodity prices in this city have suddenly soared. Although the reasons are due to traffic congestion, shortage of goods, and hoarding by non-merchants, the overly complex sales structure and the profiteering of middlemen are also major causes. In order to actively suppress prices, in addition to making efforts to dredge transportation and supply sources, we plan to start rectifying the sales mechanism first. The most important goal is to ensure that retailers can directly allocate goods, so as to avoid repeated manipulation. Currently, the retailers in the fruit and vegetable industry have been supervised by this bureau to organize a trade association and have agreed with relevant parties to directly allocate goods. This measure has been coordinated with the Public Works Department and is being implemented jointly. It is hoped that retailers in other industries in this city will also follow suit and actively organize as soon as possible, so that the stabilization of commodity prices in this city can be realized in a short period of time."</p>

<h3>Central China Heavy Industry Factories Will Be Merged, Centralized, and Production Increased; Important Materials Will Be Allocated, Quality Improved, and Labor Migration in Various Regions Will Be Handled</h3>
<p>In the industrial sector, the merger of Central China Heavy Industries is currently underway to reduce the number of agencies and improve factory equipment to centralize production. Industrial figures recently formed a group to control the production of munitions, shipbuilding, and other essential industries, and are responsible for allocating important materials, centralizing and increasing production, and improving quality. This heavy industry merger plan will not only handle the above-mentioned matters, but also plans to handle the transfer of labor in various regions to supplement shortages with surpluses, so that workers are evenly distributed. Factories in Shanghai included in the merger scope include the Luli Industrial Company, Shanghai Industrial Company, Asia Copper Factory, Toyota Machine Factory, and other Japanese-owned factories. Several have already been merged.</p>
<h3>Next Period Household Rice Ration: According to the Purchase Order, It Will Be 1.5 Sheng of White Rice and 0.5 Sheng of Broken Rice</h3>
<p>Regarding the quantity and price of household grain rations for the 27th period in the two concessions, it was learned from rice merchants by a Shanghai News Agency reporter that the contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday received purchase orders from the Rice and Grain Affairs Office. The quantity and price of rice and flour are exactly the same as in the previous period, except that the rice ration includes broken rice, which accounts for one-quarter of the total amount. Therefore, the household rice for the next period will be: (1) 1.5 sheng of white rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice, priced at five yuan; (2) flour will be 12 taels, priced at three yuan and eight and a half jiao.

<h3>Most Personnel of Economic Police Department Hired; Training Focuses on Investigation</h3>
<p>Since deciding to add an Economic Police Section in December of last year, the Public Concession Police Department has been preparing for its establishment under the leadership of Deputy Chief Inspector Wu Ming. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, most of the candidates for the positions of Chief Inspector and Inspectors have been hired. Some were hired from Japan, while others were recruited locally. As for the police officers, they have also been recruited and have been actively trained since the middle of last month. The training focuses mainly on economic aspects, so that they can understand the economic situation in Shanghai and be familiar with investigation procedures. It is expected that this group of economic police officers will be dispatched to various districts to serve in the near future.</p>
<h3>Assistance Funds for High School Second and Third Grades to Be Distributed Tomorrow; University and Industry/Commerce Groups to Receive Funds on the 17th</h3>
<p>Students Receiving Assistance Funds from Two Sources Should Quickly Declare; Otherwise, Applications Will Be Strictly Handled Next Time</p>
<p>The fourth round of Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Funds for students in the primary, secondary, industry, and commerce groups who have been approved for assistance has been announced successively since the 1st. Assistance funds for high school second and third grades will be distributed tomorrow, and assistance funds for university and industry/commerce groups will be distributed on the 17th. The staff of the Scholarship Fund Office held a meeting yesterday as usual to discuss and resolve various issues as follows:</p>
<p>Double Assistance Funds Cannot Be Received</p>
<p>Regarding the students who have been approved for assistance in this round of applications, most of those who have already received funds from other sources have been identified. This newspaper has received many letters from students declaring their withdrawal from the scholarship fund, but there are also quite a few who have not yet sent letters. It has now been decided to limit the time for students to send a letter within four days (until the 18th) declaring which source they have received assistance funds from, or that although they have been approved for assistance from other sources, they have not been able to receive it, and to attach supporting documents proving that assistance funds have not been issued from other sources, so that verification can be carried out. Otherwise, it will be regarded as having received assistance funds from other sources, and the Scholarship Fund Committee of this newspaper will ask the school of the student to return the assistance funds issued by this newspaper. At the same time, the student's future applications for assistance funds will be strictly handled. This measure is to ensure the proper use of assistance funds and to prevent a small number of students from seeking undue advantages. Students who are waiting for assistance may be eager to receive assistance and may think that they can receive assistance from Source A or Source B. Now that both Source A and Source B have been approved, they should respect the public welfare and promptly determine which source to receive funds from, and at the same time send a letter stating the reasons for verification.</p>
<p>Requests for Transfer of Assistance Cannot Be Accommodated</p>
<p>In addition, there are also letters from students who have raised tuition fees or received assistance funds from other sources, requesting to withdraw, but asking to transfer this assistance fund to other classmates of the student. If the student voluntarily withdraws, it should be allowed, but the transfer of funds is not legal. Since this newspaper has approved assistance to Student A, it cannot be transferred to Student B, which is very obvious. Furthermore, if Student B is indeed poor, they should apply for assistance according to the regulations. Since they have not gone through the application and approval procedures, how can they accept the assistance funds from this newspaper? It is hoped that the school authorities will support the charitable spirit of this newspaper's scholarship fund and notify them to return the check for the assistance funds paid by the student to this newspaper, or send a letter to this newspaper, and instruct the student to bring the check to the office for cancellation. Otherwise, this newspaper must demand the return of the original check from the student and will not make any exceptions.</p>
<p>Requests That Do Not Meet Standards Will Not Be Re-Evaluated</p>
<p>Regarding the letters from students who were not selected stating their poor family circumstances and requesting a re-evaluation, except for a portion that has been allocated assistance funds in accordance with the scholarship standards, those with poor character, extremely low grades in school and the scholarship exam, and not very difficult family circumstances will not be re-evaluated. The use of scholarship funds must not be careless in the slightest. If not in accordance with the regulations, we cannot help. Students should pay attention to this and abide by the scholarship fund regulations.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>A total of 1,000 yuan from Chen Zushun Hall, 500 yuan from Xiao Yaosheng Sun Runsheng (New Year's money), 300 yuan from Lin Yongfang, 200 yuan each from Yu Runmei and Huang Gongguan, 100 yuan each from Yiji, Sun Runsheng, and Zhongnan Watch Shop, 40 yuan from Gu Shiluo, 20 yuan each from Tang Genyuan, Qiu Zhonglin, and Cai Xiegong, 10 yuan from Fan Rongxiang, totaling 2,610 yuan in savings certificates. Previous balance: 389,435 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen. Current balance: 392,045 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen.</p>

<h3>Transport Control and Oil Control: Transport Committee Annual Report</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently released the annual work report of the Transport Control Committee, stating that the Transport Control Committee was organized and established on December 9th of the year before last. Since its establishment, its work can be summarized into three major parts:</p>
<p>1.  Control of Mineral Oil and Alcohol: This part of the work involves the registration of gasoline, fuel oil, motor oil, other mineral oils, crude oil, and alcohol inventory, restrictions on transfer, collection, storage, and distribution.</p>
<p>2.  Control of Transportation: This part of the work involves the registration of trucks and handcarts, regulations on the transportation of major goods, and the issuance of transportation permits for all motor vehicles.</p>
<p>3.  Vehicle Fuel Supply: This part of the work involves investigating alternative fuels and studying their application. This work is the responsibility of the permanent staff of the Public Works Department and the Traffic Section of the Police Department. In the first few months, the staff of the Public Works Department received assistance from volunteer oil experts, which was very helpful and appreciated.</p>
<p>Oil Control</p>
<p>After the sources of various mineral oils such as gasoline, fuel oil, and diesel oil were cut off, the Bureau had to find sufficient supply for essential uses within the settlement. Oil registration was often carried out to investigate the amount of oil in the settlement, followed by purchases and other measures to control the distribution and consumption of oil, so that the period during which the settlement's essential uses could be met with oil could be extended as much as possible.</p>
<p>On December 10th of the year before last, the Bureau issued a notice to register gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, and diesel oil. On the 13th of the same month, it issued another notice urging gasoline registration, and on the 15th of the same month, it issued a notice ordering the registration of motor oil and crude oil. As a result, 1,500 cargo owners complied with the order to register. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Central China Tobacco Allocation Association: Uniform Allocation of Japanese-Chinese Cigarettes; Review of Dealer Registration Nearing Completion; Preparing to Dispatch Goods and Strictly Enforce Price Limits</h3>
<p>In order to uniformly allocate Japanese-Chinese cigarettes, the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association has been reviewing the registration forms of all cigarette dealers in the city since February 1st, and the review is nearing completion.</p>
<p>Centralized Handling</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from the Association that regarding the allocation of cigarettes, regardless of the manufacturer, such as the Yi Zhong Tobacco Company under military management, the Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company, and the Chinese-owned Nanyang, Huacheng, Dadong, and Huamei factories, they will all be centrally allocated by the Association. The Association has made overall plans for the specific allocation methods, and will dispatch goods according to the actual needs of each dealer, and entrust major counterparts to handle the dispatch of goods to retailers.</p>
<p>First Dispatch of Goods</p>
<p>It is reported that the first unified dispatch of goods is about to begin. The dispatched goods will be sold in accordance with the stipulated price limits, absolutely adhering to the price limits and not illegally participating in black market transactions, and with the assistance of the police authorities, will fully crack down on cigarette black markets. In addition, inspectors will be dispatched to secretly investigate various retail dealers at any time. If any violations of price limits or reselling for profit are found, the right to allocate goods will be revoked and strict investigations will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Baojia Youth Department Holds First Centralized Training</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Baojia Youth Department has been promoting its work smoothly, and its training and service methods have also been concretely defined. It is known that the first centralized training of the department this year is scheduled to be held at the racecourse at 10:00 AM today. It is said that all cadres and members of the department must attend the event.</p>
<h3>Overview of Coal Rationing in Shanghai After the War</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, coal in Shanghai was managed by the China Liaison Department of the East Asia Institute. The three Japanese companies, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yamashita, formed a Coal Joint Association to control and distribute coal in Shanghai. Sixteen coal shops, including Yitaixing, Dachang, Linhao, Jianhua, Linji, Xinfu, Yuansheng, Hengtaixing, Xiachengxing, Xinyigong, Zhangzhangji, Junchang, Youxin, Fengtai, Tongshengyuan, and Sun Boji, formed a Dazhong Lian Coal Shop with a capital of 1.1 million national currency to handle coal distribution for Chinese people. It was divided into the Same Industry Business Association, Small Seller Business Association, and Coal Ball Factory Association. (1) The business scope of the Same Industry Business Coal Shop was coal for factory use, coal for civilian household use, and redistribution to small sellers; (2) The business scope of the Small Seller Coal Shop was limited to coal for civilian use. It was stipulated that the profit for the Coal Joint Association to allocate coal to the Dazhong Lian Coal Shop was 3%, plus 5% for the Same Industry Business, and the profit for the Same Industry Business to redistribute to the Small Seller was 5%.</p>
<p>Allocation Quantity</p>
<p>The quantity of coal allocated by the Dazhong Lian Coal Shop was as follows: (1) For factory use, from August to September, 9,261 tons of bituminous coal and 673 tons of anthracite coal were allocated; from October to November last year, 7,257 tons of bituminous coal and 981 tons of anthracite coal were allocated. (2) For civilian household use, from July to September, 2,100 tons of bituminous coal and 4,800 tons of anthracite coal were allocated; from October to December, 1,000 tons of bituminous coal and 6,500 tons of anthracite coal were allocated. (3) For coal ball factories, from July to September, 76,248 tons of anthracite coal dust were allocated; from October to December, 81,652 tons of anthracite coal dust were allocated. The total amount of coal for factory, civilian household, and coal ball factory use was 190,472 tons. Regarding the coal allocation from January to March of this year, the Dazhong Lian Coal Shop has issued a notice to fill out the required quantities for allocation.</p>

<h3>Propaganda Minister Lin Arrives in Shanghai: Promotes the Meaning of War Participation, Will Attend Two Gatherings Today</h3>

<h3>Private School Relief Funds to Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Special Zone Private Primary and Secondary School and Teacher Temporary Relief Fund Committee, since its establishment, it has adhered to the principle of accurate statistics and strives for swift work in order to issue the funds as soon as possible. Currently, the committee found that the school overview forms submitted within the deadline only included the number of teachers and staff, but not their names, making it impossible to verify. An order was issued to supplement the information, but it took time to go back and forth. Moreover, many part-time employees were found in the teacher and staff lists recently submitted by various schools, making the statistics even more complicated. The committee has been rushing to complete various receipt procedures and statistical confirmation numbers, and the third committee has determined the total amount of the standard relief fund to be 350,000 yuan. After deducting 10,584 yuan to cover the travel expenses of the delegation that went to Beijing to petition, 30,000 yuan will be used for school relief funds, and 300,9416 yuan will be used for teacher and staff relief funds. The distribution standard is a 6:4 ratio between primary and secondary schools and primary and secondary school teachers and staff. Once the procedures are completed, a notice will be issued to the principals of various schools to come to the committee to collect the funds.</p>
<h3>"Telepathy" Lawsuit: Mysterious and Bizarre, Defendant Claims Illness and Does Not Appear, Witness Summons Postponed for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>The owner of the Zhenhua Lace Company on Nanjing Road, Guangdong native Sun Jiaru, and his daughter Sun Yiguang, a high-achieving student at Pei Cheng Girls' School, were privately prosecuted by Zhong Sanshun of No. 12 Fook Hong Lane, Route Amiral Bayle, in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for the mysterious and bizarre lawsuit of using telepathy to inflict harm. The case was continued by Judge Zhu in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning, but the defendants Sun Jiaru and Sun Yiguang both claimed illness and did not appear. Their lawyer presented a letter from the plaintiff Zhong Sanshun's brothers, Zhong Liangshun and Zhong Yuanshun, to prove that the plaintiff did indeed have a mental disorder and was legally unable to file a private lawsuit. The defendant Sun Jiaru has suffered from illness due to excessive stimulation since the last hearing, and Sun Yiguang also suddenly fell ill yesterday, so neither of them could appear in court to respond to the lawsuit today. According to Zhong Sanshun's statement, since filing the lawsuit, the mental torture he has suffered has become even more severe than before, with constant vibrations in his head throughout the night, making it impossible to sleep. The court ruled that since there was no evidence presented for the defendant's illness, they must surrender themselves next time, or they would be dealt with according to law. The court then announced a postponement and summoned the plaintiff's wife, Zhong Wangshi, his brothers Zhong Liangshun and Zhong Yuanshun, and the two defendants to appear in court for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chongming Teachers and Staff to Receive Increased Pay</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau, upon receiving instructions from Mayor Chen, relayed to all district offices under its jurisdiction that teachers and staff in district-run schools who are living in poverty should have their pay increased. Starting from February of this year, their salaries and allowances will be increased to 80% of those of teachers and staff in municipal schools. The Chongming District has already complied with the order.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Warning Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 6:55 AM yesterday morning, an air raid siren suddenly sounded in the city as a warning alarm. The city's self-defense forces and police corps were already on duty and immediately implemented alert arrangements, ordering the lights of shops and residents to be turned off to implement a state of alert. The lights of all vehicles were also ordered to be dimmed. According to inquiries afterwards, it was learned that it was an alert drill alarm. At the same time, the siren was also tested for its sound level.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai District Briefly Blockaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>The West Shanghai District was blockaded once yesterday (the 13th) after the alarm bell rang at 11:10 AM. Traffic was cut off for a time, and patrolmen and Baojia members of the police corps were dispatched. The blockade lasted for 15 minutes and was then lifted, and traffic was restored. It was later learned that the reason for the blockade was that plainclothes detectives from the General Bureau were searching the area under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the West Shanghai Police Station, which led to misunderstandings with residents. After explanations from both sides, the matter was resolved.</p>
<h3>Small Newspapers Comply with Merger Order: The "Xiong Bao" Also Ceases Publication</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system and save materials, the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, with the approval of the Propaganda Department, has reorganized the small newspapers in Shanghai, ordering each newspaper to merge and publish separately, which has been implemented since the 1st of this month. However, the "Xiong Bao," which was originally designated to merge with the "Social Daily," was still published independently. The office investigated and strictly ordered it to cease publication. The newspaper has now officially complied with the order and ceased publication.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops and Pawnshops to Carefully Handle Mortgage Loans: Limited to Members of Respective Trade Associations, Term of Three Months Cannot Be Extended</h3>

(1) Mortgage loans are limited to members of the respective trade associations. Applicants must provide proof from their respective trade associations. (2) The loan term is limited to three full months. After the term expires, no extensions will be allowed.

<h3>Thoroughly Eradicating Old Bad Habits: Second Anti-Spitting Campaign Begins, Health Department Hopes Residents Will Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's anti-spitting campaign held its first session in mid-December last year, which was quite effective. It is now learned that in order to thoroughly eradicate the bad habit of spitting everywhere, the Municipal Council Health Department will launch the second campaign today (the 14th). The following information has been obtained from the Health Department:</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Investigate Rule-Breaking Citizens</p>
<p>Municipal Council Health Director Tashiro Yoshiaki has already dispatched personnel to various public places to be responsible for investigation since deciding to hold the second anti-spitting campaign today, and has authorized them to show badges to those who are found to be spitting everywhere and, together with police officers, take them to the police station to be fined five yuan.</p>
<p>Police Officers Have No Authority to Collect Money on the Spot</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to prevent various malpractices, although police officers have the obligation to investigate those who spit everywhere, they do not have the authority to collect fines on the spot. They can only cooperate with patrolmen to take them to the police station. As for the forms of spitting everywhere, it has also been stipulated that in addition to sputum spat out of the mouth, nasal mucus sprayed from the nose is also included in the scope of spitting everywhere and will be investigated and prohibited.</p>
<p>Propaganda Work Actively Carried Out</p>
<p>It is also learned that the propaganda work for this campaign will still be carried out. From today to the 20th, conspicuous slogans and propaganda posters will still be hung or posted in various public places and roads in the same style as during the first campaign. The Health Department authorities also stated that the implementation of the fine rules for cracking down on spitting is a last resort and does not intentionally cause residents to suffer losses. The reason for doing so is to make the public pay attention to public health.</p>
<h3>Student Loafing: Stealing Bicycles</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang native Yu Xinjie, 20 years old, residing at No. _, Lane _, Begen Road, Route Lafayette, used to study at a certain school, but has now dropped out. He often wanders around and specializes in stealing bicycles from various secondary schools for a living. He was previously arrested by detectives from the French Police Station and sentenced to eight months in prison by the Second Special District Court. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and appealed, and the sentence was changed to four months in prison. After being released recently, he has not changed his ways and has been stealing bicycles in various places. He was recently arrested by detectives again and brought to court for interrogation. The court ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Liu Shuqing Missing</h3>
<p>Liu Shuqing, the 14-year-old son of Tianjin woman Liu Ma, who resides at No. 2, Sanduo Lane, Jingxiu Road, Nanshi, used to work as a character engraver at the Zhu Wenchang engraving shop nearby. Unexpectedly, Liu Shuqing suddenly went missing a few days ago. Although his mother and Zhu Wenchang entrusted people to search everywhere, they were unsuccessful. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Zhu Wenchang and Liu Ma reported the situation to the responsible police authorities, requesting assistance in finding him. It is reported that Liu Shuqing was wearing a blue cloth long coat, black pants, and black shoes. He speaks with a local accent and is five feet tall.</p>
<h3>Central Market Brokers Association Reorganized as Investment Cooperative, Evaluation Committee Established</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime economic system, the Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market has made reasonable adjustments to the collection, import, pricing, and distribution of goods. The existing system of brokers' associations in the market will be completely revamped and reorganized into investment cooperatives. With regard to food and other daily necessities, the market has formulated the "Essential Guidelines for Establishing Investment Cooperatives for the Collection and Distribution of Goods for Various Departments" and the "Implementation Guidelines for Investment Cooperatives for Goods," ordering the brokers' associations in various industries to organize separately. Various industries have now registered to participate in the respective investment cooperatives. As for small retailers and peddlers who normally receive allocations from the market, the market has contacted the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Council Public Works Bureau. Those who have been registered and approved by them will be designated as designated retail stores after verification by the market. It is learned that the cured meat, dried goods, and sundry goods industries, the northern goods industry, the Chinese paper industry, the spiritual paper foil industry, the beeswax industry, the miscellaneous firewood and charcoal industry, the fruit industry, the local goods industry, and the poultry egg industry are preparing to establish investment cooperatives, which are expected to be established in the latter half of this month. At the same time, the market will also establish an evaluation committee to be responsible for evaluating the prices of imported goods and adjusting supply and demand.</p>

<h3>Reducing Fines for Baojia Violations</h3>
<p>— Ye Jintai</p>
<p>Baojia was originally established to maintain local security and the safety of the people. Now, seeing the reported measures for fining violations of Baojia in the French Concession, there are several points that can be discussed:</p>
<p>(1) Losing a resident identification card is fined 20 yuan. Since identification cards should be carried at all times, loss is unavoidable. Even with great care, they can be lost or stolen. If a coolie or hawker loses an identification card, their family will inevitably go without food for a day. Therefore, it is suggested that the fine for each lost identification card be reduced to five yuan, and those unable to pay the fine should be exempted.</p>
<p>(2) Failure of the head of household to report changes in affiliated households is fined 50 yuan. This item does not specify the number of days of overdue reporting that should be punished. When an affiliated household moves in, it takes a considerable amount of time to complete the procedures for finding a guarantor or taking a photo. Many Chinese people are illiterate, and the household registration form of such people needs to be written by someone else, which also takes time. If these necessary days are arbitrarily stipulated by the Baojia officials, those who are wrongly fined will inevitably be numerous, and corruption will easily occur.</p>
<p>(3) For members of the people's police corps in the French Concession, each Lianbao chief will use a lottery method to designate 75 people from residents aged 20 to 35 in the Lianbao. Those who are drawn will always stand guard, and those who are lucky enough not to be drawn will be permanently exempted from service. This method seems to be fairer if all those who reach the appropriate age serve, or if a new batch is rotated every six months.</p>
<p>(4) Lianbao chiefs are all volunteers who work hard and contribute money for the Baojia. They should not be punished for small mistakes. If an armband is lost through no fault of the Lianbao chief, they should not be punished. If it is lost due to their fault, it is best to change the word "fine" to "voluntary donation."</p>
<h3>Concerning "Squeezing on the Tram"</h3>
<p>— Yang Xiqi</p>
<p>The discussion about "squeezing on the tram" in the Shenbao reader forum is indeed a significant transportation issue. In my opinion, it is quite difficult for citizens of this city. Often, one has to wait for more than half an hour to get on a tram, and passengers have to take great risks if they want to get on ahead of others. This is really because there are too many passengers. Although the company dispatches the maximum number of trams daily, they are still overcrowded, especially routes 20, 1, and 12, which are never even slightly empty each time. In such a crowded situation, I believe that the following improvements should be made to the trams:</p>
<p>(1) Absolutely prohibit smoking. Although there are "No Smoking" notices posted on the trams recently, they are just like waste paper. People still "do what they want regardless of what you say." In fact, smoking on the tram is very dangerous. At a minimum, it can burn other people's clothing and shoes; at worst, it can burn the tram itself and cause a major disaster. At the same time, in a situation where the authorities are strictly prohibiting spitting, it should be even more strictly prohibited on the trams. In addition, when it is extremely crowded, workers often carry sharp metal tools such as knives and saws, which is extremely dangerous! If one is not careful, one will be injured or even harm oneself. Attention should be paid to this.</p>
<p>(2) When it is extremely crowded, public servants who ride for free or tram company employees in uniform absolutely enjoy priority. I hope that in the future, all such people should give way to other passengers first. Moreover, they should not occupy seats on the tram but yield them to those who pay, so as to avoid inequality between rights and obligations.</p>
<p>(3) Since the 21st, after the tram company revised the stops and fares, it has provided us passengers with a good opportunity to prevent ticket sellers from cheating. In addition to paying attention to the stops and fares, when getting off the tram, we should never return the old ticket to the ticket seller. Otherwise, if you unfortunately encounter a ticket inspector, you will often be accused of cheating, or even be insulted and scolded. Isn't this unjust?</p>

<h3>Amidst High Demand and Low Supply, Chinese Stocks Rise Vigorously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw increasingly strong gains amidst a buying frenzy. Public utilities, department stores, cultural stocks, and new industries all showed real strength and were difficult to reverse. This was due to the confidence of investors and the enthusiastic absorption of stocks by new and old investors, with the number of shares available for sale insufficient to meet the demand from buyers. Zhabei Water and Electricity gradually rose from 102.5 yuan to 115 yuan during the day, before slightly retreating at noon to 111 yuan, still a massive increase of 8 yuan. China Electric rose from 71 yuan to a new high of 82 yuan, before settling at 80 yuan at noon, still up by more than 8 yuan. Cultural stocks saw few sales, with the Commercial Press approaching the 700 yuan mark, soaring by 50 yuan. China Book Company rose to 280 yuan, a late entry price, also jumping by 20 yuan. Transactions for World Book Company were rare, with prices soaring to 145 yuan. Wing On Company saw large investors tending to absorb huge amounts of stock, rising from 173 yuan to 185 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Sincere also reached 185 yuan, up 9 yuan. China National Products Company gained 10 yuan, reaching around 94 yuan, up 4.5 yuan. Lai Wah Company traded at 480 yuan, with underwear rising by 1 yuan to 24 yuan. New Asia Amusement Factory saw fierce competition, reaching a high price of 29 yuan. Sino-French rose by 2.25 yuan to 35 yuan, and Min Yee also rose by 2.5 yuan, with a trading price of 67.5 yuan. Sino-Western Pharmacy traded at around 480 yuan, and Yi Yee at around 300 yuan, both making upward progress. Wing On Cotton Mill No. 1 rose from 425 yuan to 445 yuan, a significant increase of 22.5 yuan. Great China Mill reached 600 yuan, and Mill No. 3 reached 500 yuan, again at an increasing price, with few shares being sold. Small denomination You Sheng Dyeing and Weaving rose to 13.75 yuan, Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing rose to 23 yuan, and Guoguang to 14 yuan, while the rest were relatively weak. Great China Match sold at 390 yuan, soaring to 400 yuan and reaching 410 yuan, before settling at 402.5 yuan at noon, still up 7.5 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rose by 6 yuan to reach 185-6 yuan. China Enamel traded at 120 yuan and 30 yuan. In the financial sector, Shanghai Bank traded over 1,300 yuan, and Zhejiang Xingye Bank initially traded at 1,500 yuan, before reaching 1,410 yuan, both as trading prices. Zhongxing Timber rose to 11.5 yuan, with relatively active trading.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Marches Forward Bravely, Reaching New Prices</h3>
<p>The bond market continued to rise yesterday, remaining strong. Various bonds continued to rise vigorously amidst buoyant investor sentiment. Five types of public bonds have all broken through the 70 yuan mark and have all reached new prices. Half of the gains were due to sellers covering their positions, and half were due to enthusiastic buying by new investors, resulting in a rapid surge without any retracement. With such rapid progress, a market price of 80% of face value may soon be reached. The initial trading price for Type C bonds was 5 yuan 5 jiao, briefly falling to 5 yuan. As a result of competition, it actually broke through 7 yuan, eventually settling at 6 yuan 8 jiao. Type A rose from 2 yuan 8 jiao to 4 yuan, Type B from 2 yuan to 3 yuan, before falling back to just over 1 yuan, eventually settling at 2 yuan 4 jiao. Type D was raised to outside the pass for about 9 yuan. Type E opened at 2 yuan to 2 yuan 5 jiao, then fell back to 1.56 yuan, finally settling at 2 yuan 3 jiao, a difference of 4 yuan 5 jiao more than Type C. This difference is more than double the previous amount. This kind of anomaly, due to lack of attention during the rising trend, made Type E seem particularly cheap. With the upward trend showing no signs of abating, a retracement may not be easily seen.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate and Military Bonds Remain Stable, United Bank Notes Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, military bonds remained stable, with interbank trading at 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 2 li 4 hao. Small money shops and bank retail prices ranged from 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen half, or 6 fen, and 4 fen half. United Bank notes have rebounded slightly by 6 fen, with traders selling at 4 yuan 2 fen and buying at 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Trade Association's call loan rate remained at 1 jiao 8 fen, with no changes.</p>
<h3>Various Banks Continue to Offer Small-Scale Industrial and Commercial Loans</h3>
<p>Various banks in the city, recognizing that idle funds are not being properly utilized and are tending towards speculation, which has a significant impact on legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and can lead to rising prices, decided to offer small-scale industrial and commercial credit and mortgage loans in March of last year in order to support and develop industrial and commercial businesses. It is understood that the loans issued by various banks last year have been fully recovered, with excellent results. Now that the traditional year-end closing period has passed, various banks have decided to continue to offer these loans. It is reported that the Shanghai Fuxing Bank has decided to start offering credit and mortgage loans next week, with credit loans ranging from 500 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and mortgage loans ranging from 1,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Summer Woolen Fabrics Are Even Scarcer</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics, yarn, ramie silk, and other goods are all trending upwards in price. Goods needed for summer are even scarcer and more expensive. French flannel sells for 380 yuan per yard, Ley and Palace open at 220 yuan, Ewo feather yarn at 200 yuan, Yu Yu white drill at 360 yuan, Kamey ramie cloth at 65 yuan, Bao Xin ramie rubber cloth at 18 yuan, and You Sheng rainproof cloth at 30 yuan. Judging by the intentions of the goods owners, the market is still expected to improve, with most unwilling to sell.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market, after rebounding strongly the previous day, continued to rise. Fine cloth rose by more than 10 yuan. Sijunzi Drill rose from 13 yuan 4 jiao to 13 yuan 9 jiao, settling at 13 yuan 8 jiao at noon, an increase of 6 jiao 5 fen from the previous day. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Ladies' Linen sold for 530 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Trading Is Very Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean cake trading was quite active in the miscellaneous grains market. This was because merchants with capital were accumulating stocks, leading to a gradual increase in market strength. Kaiyuanlong soybean cake was priced at 113 yuan to 118 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen for three carts, Feizi soybean cake at 110 yuan 5 jiao to 117 yuan for four carts, and another two carts for delivery in one or two weeks at 113 yuan. Sheng Ji and Lizi soybean cake for delivery in February and March were priced at 115 yuan to 128 yuan half for 5,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities: Hoarders Holding Firm, Asking Prices Keep Rising</h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities are rising step by step, which has a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people. The authorities, recognizing this, sent personnel to investigate thoroughly yesterday, and the market felt slightly calmer. In general, goods owners are holding firm and unwilling to sell, citing the increasing scarcity and high prices of goods, leading to an unusually tight market. Phoenix brand matches are priced at 5,500 yuan, Meili brand at 5,700 yuan, Jindin brand at 4,500 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 3,000 yuan, Gubenzhai soap at 920 yuan, Baizu Mao soap at 830 yuan, Huangxiang Mao soap at 790 yuan, Scissors soap at 890 yuan, Baizhi shi Western candles at 580 yuan, and Sengmao brand at 480 yuan, with sharp increases.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Are Consistently Prosperous</h3>
<p>The cigarette market, with goods owners holding firm and unwilling to release their goods, makes it difficult to expect prices to fall. The prices of various goods are still higher than the previous day. Great Britain brand is priced at 13,600 yuan, up 300 yuan; Old Knife brand at 10,600 yuan; Pinhai brand at 8,000 yuan; Wuhua brand at 7,200 yuan; and Fairy brand at 8,150 yuan, all up by 100 to 200 yuan.

National cigarettes Pyramid is at 7,600 yuan, Meili brand at 7,300 yuan, Jinshu Pi at 4,500 yuan, and Bai Jinlong at 4,700 yuan, all consistently prosperous.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches Open at High Prices</h3>
<p>The Jinshan branch market was initially stable, but recently, due to few transactions, the momentum has picked up. Shipments have already opened and risen by 90 yards. Checking the inventory still shows a large amount, so excessive increases do not seem appropriate.</p>
<h3>Western Indigo Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Western indigo, with fewer transactions, has seen a stable market. The sales price from the trading houses is only set at 1,250 yuan for medium and 1,450 yuan for large. Recently, asking prices have increased slightly, but inventories are not thin, so excessive increases will not be easy.</p>
<h3>Sandalwood Slices Trade at High Prices</h3>
<p>Sandalwood slices are in short supply and difficult to acquire, so although stomach health demand is lacking, trading houses are acquiring. Initial trading house prices were set at 110 yuan, but due to lack of transactions, prices rose. The higher asking prices opened at over 150 yuan, up 30-40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Remains Quiet as Always</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market remained quiet, with no sign of a flourishing atmosphere. Both local and foreign sales were quiet. Prices mostly followed the public meeting prices, but the market showed a situation of trading price without activity. Yesterday's prices included 2.5 to 1.5 li new steel plates at 30,000 yuan per ton, 1.5 fen to thick at 25,000 yuan, No. 16 to No. 20 new iron wire at 25,000 yuan per ton, No. 11 to No. 25 at 30,000 yuan, No. 8 to No. 15 new lead wire at 30,050 yuan per ton, No. 16 to No. 25 at 50,000 yuan, circle head soft steel road skin at 30,000 yuan per ton, Zheng Hao saw blades at 40,050 yuan, black iron billets at 20,000 yuan, new angle iron at 24,000 yuan, new foreign plates at 20,000 yuan, and yellow steel wire at 26,000 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>Abandoning One's Wife</h3>
<p>— Zheng Quan</p>
<p>I received a letter from a friend saying that Mr. So-and-so has been very successful in his official career and financial affairs in recent years, and a poor scholar has become a popular figure with wealth and power. The first step this popular figure took in "managing his family" was to abandon his wife who had shared his hardships and officially marry a "queen" Miss So-and-so from a girls' school.</p>
<p>Old-style marriages in our country are mostly based on parents' orders and matchmakers' words, which is unreasonable. In the eyes of the new generation, this kind of marriage that is not based on love is sinful, so divorce is a reasonable remedy.</p>
<p>This theory of the sanctity of love is beyond reproach. We need to observe and study the facts. In the past two or three decades, the most common types of abandonment we have seen involve the following two scenarios:</p>
<p>In rural areas, men and women without education get married based on their parents' orders and matchmakers' words. Later, the husband goes to the city and receives a new education, and the first major event is to divorce his "rural wife" and marry an educated woman.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, a couple gets married and initially has a good relationship, bearing children. Later, the husband becomes successful. He becomes illegally involved with a "modern" woman outside and treats his aging and unattractive wife as a thorn in his side, unilaterally abandoning her.</p>
<p>Despite the slogans of equality between men and women being shouted until our throats are hoarse, in reality, society is still centered on men. Many newly educated women shout about equal rights for men and women, but in fact, they are often seduced by "married men," breaking up other people's families. This can be said to be "cannibalism among the same sex." As for some newly educated men who shout about equality between men and women and respect for women, but in reality play with women, insult women, and trample on women, they can be even more accurately described as "scum of men" and "enemies of women."</p>
<p>I remember there is such a passage in "Yanzi Chunqiu":</p>
<p>"Duke Jing of Qi had a beloved daughter and asked to marry her to Yanzi. The Duke then went to Yanzi's home for a banquet. After drinking for a while, the Duke saw his wife and said, 'Is this your wife?' Yanzi replied, 'Yes, she is!' The Duke said, 'Alas, she is old and ugly! I have a daughter who is young and beautiful. Please let her fill your palace.' Yanzi stepped away from his mat and said, 'When she was old and ugly, I lived with her because of the past. Now that she is young and beautiful, she will surely pass away. Moreover, when I was strong, I entrusted myself to her when she was old, and when I was beautiful, I entrusted myself to her when she was ugly. Having entrusted myself to her, I have already received her. Even if you bestow her upon me, can I betray my entrustment?' He bowed twice and declined."</p>
<p>This kind of opportunity is what most "handsome and clever men" of modern times "long for day and night," but Yanzi actually "bowed and declined." In the eyes of these "heroes," they would definitely say that Yanzi is a "fool" and a "moron," and regret that they were "born at the wrong time" and could not personally meet Duke Jing of Qi!</p>
<h3>Small Talk on Life</h3>
<p>— Xu Hongsheng</p>
<p>The joy of life is a kind of hope. Only with hope can we live on with joy.</p>
<p>But hope has its limits. It must be rational and something that we must truly pursue ourselves. Otherwise, hope becomes a bubble, and joy becomes worry.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone might ask: Haven't those who speculate and make huge profits achieved hope and success? We can very well emulate them. But you only see today, and not what will happen tomorrow or the day after? This is by no means a far-fetched argument or mere self-comfort. Just look at the "Protecting Wealth Methods" published by Mr. Nie Yuntai in recent days, and you will know that this statement is true.</p>
<p>Some people say that life is just a dream, so why bother working hard all day long? It is true that life is a dream, but if it is a dream, what will you do? Can you die immediately? Or escape from the world; can you not eat or wear clothes? Since it is a dream, then it also needs to be a lively, joyful, and meaningful dream.</p>
<p>Confucius was anxious and restless, never having a peaceful day. Mozi wore out his hair and heels to benefit the world. They pursued such dreams and have been engraved in people's minds without fading away.</p>
<h3>The Old and Weak Are Discarded by the Roadside</h3>
<p>— Jing Zuo</p>
<h3>Success Factors for Shop Assistants</h3>
<p>— I Xu</p>
<p>When a shop assistant joins a certain shop, he has always carefully considered whether it suits his conditions, because he hopes to develop his talents and realize his hopes from this ideal base: from trainee to employee to team leader to supervisor and even manager, or to operate his own business, from a small shop to a large shop, to even a firm or company. Of course, these goals are not unattainable. In the entire business world, many successful big figures and entrepreneurs have not all climbed up step by step? However, proportionally speaking, they only account for a very small number. What is the reason for this? Simply put, it is because each successful person, in addition to having sufficient knowledge, also has special success factors. The above is only in terms of the employee's own aspects. If we take the shop owner's aspect into consideration, a shop assistant with success factors can also provide assistance to the business that we cannot imagine. These factors are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Enthusiasm for the job is the most important thing. The shop assistant must have an interest in the work he is engaged in and develop a mood of enjoying the job. He must see it as sacred and great, the most precious thing besides life. Since he is comforted in his spirit, he will work diligently and wholeheartedly. Therefore, the work results are good, and the work speed is high. His own position and reputation gradually increase, and the shop's business also flourishes, and the ideal goals can be achieved one by one.</p>
<p>(2) Progress. "Contentment brings happiness" is indeed a famous saying, but it is not applicable to the pursuit of knowledge. Although a lot of knowledge can be obtained from school books and work experience, the world is so big and full of wonders. Here are truths and situations that we have never heard of or seen before. If you do not know how to progress, you will soon be abandoned and outdated by the times. In addition, according to the principle of metabolism and survival of the fittest, you will be ostracized by colleagues and rejected by society. Therefore, you must be familiar with various books, newspapers, and magazines, and study various literary arts and sciences, so that new books and knowledge can be increased together. You should not be satisfied with inheriting the work skills of the predecessors, but should explore the origins, study carefully, improve old methods, and create new methods to suit the needs of individuals and society.</p>
<p>(3) Honesty. Honesty is the expression of "trust." Anyone must have credibility, especially the employees of shops. Only honest and reliable shop assistants can be entrusted with important tasks. Higher positions often have considerable responsibilities, so only those who can gain the trust of others through honesty can receive high salaries and be respected and be leaders. Otherwise, the lighter cases will result in suspension and salary reduction, and the more serious cases will result in ruin and disgrace. Even if they can stay in their original position, it is only a temporary matter of being a mediocre person.</p>
<p>(4) Perseverance. When engaging in a certain job, difficulties are inevitable at the beginning, but "Yu Gong moves the mountain" and "grinding an iron pestle into a needle" are famous folk sayings that symbolize the hard-won perseverance. Looking back at famous people throughout history, both at home and abroad, who has not succeeded because of hard work? If one is fickle and ambitious, then one's work will become increasingly boring, and as a result, one will abandon the job and change careers. After a long time, one will be proficient in nothing and capable of nothing, and will be even further away from one's goals.</p>
<p>(5) Humility. After a considerable period of work, many shop assistants (and other professionals are no exception) often like to show off their talents and brag and be competitive because they have considerable experience. Therefore, those who are skilled are unwilling to teach more, and those who are virtuous are unwilling to persuade more. The mysteries cannot be fully understood, which can be said to be failing to build a mountain after only leveling one basket of earth. If one can be humble and ask for advice, then the benefits gained will be more than one can expect.</p>
<p>(6) Objective Vision. Any customer welcomes things that are cheap. However, they will willingly pay a high price for things that particularly satisfy their desires. Therefore, if a shop assistant can, on the one hand, use an objective vision to predict the psychology of customers, and on the other hand, use vivid eloquence and methods of understanding or analysis to explain the low price and high quality, richness, and magnificence of the goods in order to arouse their desire for material enjoyment, then the purchase of goods will be very smooth.</p>
<p>The above are just a few examples. There are many others, but they need to be collected and discovered by the shop staff themselves. In short, the greater the amount of factors contained, the faster the success, and the better the results.</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(10) (3)</p>
<p>1915. From the sea to Switzerland, the various armies fought to the death, each refusing to give way. The Dardanelles, Gallipoli, were very close to Brookfield's terrain. Military camps sprang up like mushrooms after rain; the soldiers used the playground as a place for sports and training; Brookfield's officer training corps developed rapidly. Most of the young teachers had left, or had been drafted. Every Sunday evening, after evening prayer in the chapel, Chatteris would read out the names of the old students who had died in battle, with a short biography attached to each name, which was very moving; but Gibbs, sitting in the black seats downstairs, always thought: they were just names to him; he would not see their faces like I did...</p>
<p>1916. ...Battles of the Somme. Twenty-three names were read out on a certain Sunday evening. By that critical July, on a certain afternoon at the end of the month, Chatteris was talking to Gibbs in Mrs. Wiggatf's house. He was overworked, over-worried, and somewhat morbid. "To be honest with you, Gibbin, my days here are really not easy to live. I'm thirty-nine, you know, and not married, and many people seem to think they know what I should be doing. Also, I happen to have diabetes, and I can't get past the most mindless medical officer, but I don't understand why I should nail a medical certificate on my front door."</p>
<p>Gibbs had no prior knowledge of this, which surprised him, because he liked Chatteris. Chatteris continued: "You see, it's like this. Lars has employed many young people - all good, of course - but most of them have already joined the war, and the replacements, on the whole, are terrible. One night last week, during a preparatory class, they poured ink down someone's neck - idiots - exhibiting hysterical illness. I have to go to work myself, substituting preparatory classes for these idiots, working until midnight every night, making me unable to muster any energy for anything. I can't stand this suffering any longer. If things don't change next semester, I'm going to get sick." (35)</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on "Blood Transfusion"</h3>
<p>— Peng Liu</p>
<p>Some people in Shanghai call money "blood." On one hand, this saying emphasizes the importance of money. On the other hand, it also shows the value of blood. Therefore, when we lack blood in our body, our panic is no less than, and even greater than, lacking money.</p>
<p>The prosperity of modern science has opened people's eyes: the human body is no different from a machine, and if any part is damaged, methods can be found to repair it. Speaking of blood, when blood is lacking, blood from others can be used to replenish it. This method is called "blood transfusion," or in medical terms, "blood transfusion method."</p>
<p>As the meaning of blood transfusion is as mentioned above, the protagonists who will play this play must be two: the person receiving blood is called the recipient, and the person giving blood to others is called the donor. And the blood donor must have considerable qualifications. Of course, the donor's body must be healthy, and it must be confirmed that there are no infectious diseases. The most important qualification is "blood type." Originally, although human blood is red in color on the surface, it can be divided into four different types in terms of composition. If any two of the four types of blood are mixed together, some have no changes, while others can congeal into clumps. This change is caused by the different properties and components of the blood. These four different types are scientifically called four "blood types." Everyone has a fixed blood type that does not change throughout their life and is related to heredity. The blood type of the donor must be the same as that of the recipient, or at least it must not cause changes in the recipient's blood. Otherwise, the transfused blood will be "frozen" and cannot be used, which is not only ineffective but also harmful. Therefore, the blood types of the two protagonists must be checked before blood transfusion. In addition, there are some minor conditions such as age, bloodline, and gender, but none of them are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>There are two methods for blood transfusion: one is direct, using a transfusion device to insert one end into the donor's blood vessel and the other end into the recipient's blood vessel, relying on the action of the device to complete the blood transfusion procedure. The other is indirect, drawing blood from the donor and adding chemical reagents (such as sodium citrate) or stirring with a glass rod to prevent the blood from clotting, and then injecting it into the recipient's blood vessel. Both methods are used, but the indirect method is more common.</p>
<p>The effect of blood transfusion is quite significant. The transfused blood contains nutrients and can also have a "tonic" effect. Therefore, it can be used in cases of bleeding, anemia, infectious diseases, and weak resistance. However, it should not be performed in certain diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. In addition, when there is poison in the blood, it is very effective to first remove part of the poisoned blood and then inject healthy blood.</p>
<p>Many doctors often advise patients to have blood transfusions. This method is indeed reasonable, because as long as it meets the above-mentioned conditions, blood transfusion is always good and not bad. However, doctors must also consider the recipient's financial burden, because each blood transfusion requires considerable expensive fees.</p>
<p>Because of the cost issue, I thought that foreigners often voluntarily donate blood to poor patients without taking any remuneration. This chivalrous spirit is indeed worthy of our emulation, because in healthy people, if some blood is transfused, more blood can be produced, without any danger. Furthermore, speaking of the "blood" that Shanghai people say, it is not easy to obtain "blood" these days. Everyone should strive to "save blood" in their own expenses, and there are many people in society who suffer from "anemia." We should be more generous in "transfusing blood," which is more convenient than the above-mentioned blood transfusion. The blood donor is not restricted by blood type, and the recipient does not need to have any contraindications. Therefore, we should all use the "blood" that we have "saved" ourselves to "transfuse" to others. Firstly, it will save others from the panic of lacking "blood," and secondly, after transfusing some "blood," more "blood" can be produced, and continue to "transfuse blood." Then the result will definitely enable everyone to have "blood" prosperity and good luck, and the society will also be healthy and prosperous.</p>
<h3>Depression</h3>
<p>— Han Yijing</p>
<p>"Depression" can make people negative and even harm their body and energy.</p>
<p>However, the emergence of "depression" is actually very complicated. Of course, dissatisfaction with reality is one of the reasons, but the inner contradictions have their natural results. For example, his ideal things or environment are completely opposite to the facts of the outside world, which makes him dissatisfied with everything in reality, thus forming his "depression."</p>
<p>Everyone has depression, even the richest millionaire also has his depression places and periods, but the content that exists is different. Generally speaking, "depression" is a phenomenon of all new developments, that is, everything has its contradictions. When contradictions conflict with each other, they cause things to develop forward—to another new stage.</p>
<p>However, the power of this development still depends on the subjective power to produce. Otherwise, not only will there be no development, but also the above-mentioned bad results will occur, that is, it will lead people to a negative and pessimistic path, and make physical health move towards a state of weakness.</p>
<p>Because depression has formed such a phenomenon, it has lost the certainty of the fun of life. How can we still talk about the progress of learning and the success of career? Social Service</p>
<h3>Small Clerk of a Foreign Firm - Drifting in a Shelter</h3>
<p>There is nothing more painful in life than unemployment, but unemployment cannot be avoided by human power, so most people who could have lived a stable life are displaced and homeless due to unemployment. This newspaper received a letter from Fang Xianming yesterday saying: "I am a small clerk in a foreign firm. I am already thirty-seven years old this year. I have some knowledge of writing, but because of the Great East Asia Holy War for Liberation, I have suffered from unemployment. Under such a severe living environment, my family of six initially borrowed money to live on, and then sold belongings, until now I have nothing left except my body. In the past few months, some have been sick and some have died. Now there are only two people left, one is me, and the other is my eldest son Yunzhong. Fortunately, he got help from friends last month and was taken to the Dinghai Poor Children's Education Institute, while I was wandering like this because I had no relatives and no friends who could help me. Suffering from hunger and cold, I joined the shelter set up by the Shanghai West Poor People's Relief Association on the 30th of last month. The address is in Jinjia Lane. Later, because there was no bedding, I had to hug some straw to keep out the cold at night. As for eating, from February 1st, the porridge distribution place jointly run by the World Red Swastika Society and the Relief Association distributed porridge once a day to fill my stomach. However, during the Spring Festival holiday, the porridge distribution was temporarily suspended, so although most of the more than one hundred patients could beg for a living, some people were not accustomed to begging. Fortunately, a local merchant, the philanthropist Lu Songtang, learned about it and bought hundreds of steamed buns alone to distribute, so that they could get through this difficult situation. Now, although the above-mentioned two charitable organizations continue to distribute porridge, it is not a way to settle down in the long run. The suffering is difficult to describe in words. I have always known that your newspaper is the center of public opinion and is enthusiastic about society. May I ask for your guidance on how to make a living, or can you publish it to the society, as long as there is something to eat, no matter what kind of labor, hard labor is welcome, and I will be very grateful." (Note: Regarding unemployment relief, this newspaper has a small loan fund to help the unemployed make a living on their own. You can come to this museum to apply.)</p>
<h3>Jinyuan Money Shop Established Small Loan Fund</h3>
<p>At this time when everything is expensive, who can remain unmoved when they see the refugees suffering from hunger and cold, and not lend a helping hand? People of all industries have risen up to help generously, and the small loan fund of this newspaper has achieved considerable results. Recently, it was heard that the Jinyuan Money Shop at No. 9 Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, has also established a small loan fund for the common people, with a loan amount ranging from one yuan to two hundred yuan, with a maximum term of three months. Applicants must have a shop guarantee or a person with a considerable position, and the guarantor must bear joint and several liability for compensation.</p>
<h3>News of Free Elementary School</h3>
<p>(1) Tianguang Elementary School at No. 853 Lujiabang Road, in order to reduce the burden on students' parents, has been changed to a free elementary school since the last semester, and tuition and miscellaneous fees are completely waived. In addition, in order to shorten the school year so that it can serve the needlework association as soon as possible, classes are held all day, as usual on Sundays, and summer and winter vacations are shortened. It is expected that the higher elementary school curriculum can be completed within one year. There are still 20 places available in the higher elementary school department, which can be recommended or selected to supplement those who do not accept scholarships.</p>
<p>(2) The First Free School of the Seventh District of the Navy Security Group, No. 56, Lane 175, Alabaster Road, was founded by District Chief Cai Tianhui and colleagues of the Security Group, with the aim of rescuing poor and out-of-school children.

<h3>Righteous Deeds of Self-Defense Corps Members</h3>
<p>(Letter) My son, Li Shu, seven years old, went missing on the 2nd. Just as the family was searching without success and was anxiously reporting to the police, he was suddenly sent back by Mr. Chen Rongzhang, a member of the Fifth District Self-Defense Corps. It was then known that the child had been tricked to near the Hongkou vegetable market by a "skinning frog" person, who stripped off his gray wool coat. Afterwards, he cried. Mr. Chen saw this and took him to the district office with a letter and sent him home. His ability to reunite my family is due to Mr. Chen and the district office, and also serves as a warning to the general parents. Sincerely, Su Jiemei.</p>
