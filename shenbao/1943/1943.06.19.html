<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論助學運動</h3>
<p>本報下學期助學金運動，今已開始籌募，回顧過去四屆的成績（請參閱十六日本報），我們深切感到如下幾點：第一，由歷次捐助人數之增加及捐助金額之增加，可以證明社會上有眼光，有熱情的人士，確實很多；他們一見到助學運動開始了，便願意踴躍捐助，幫助國家社會培育人材。第二，由歷屆接受助學金學生方面，看出幾個特點：（一）是申請者人數之多，幾乎十倍於我們實際可以助學的力量，也可見社會有志而失學靑少年之多。（二）是應試靑少年們的成績，大都足夠水準，特別在其志趣方面，更足令人振奮，覺得多數失學靑少年中，確有不少可造之材。（三）是應試靑少年中，有不少是公務人員及中等階級家庭的子女，照理他們不應接受助學金，但實際上他們的家長確實無力供給他們就學。第三，在學校方面，我們雖然還沒有舉行切實和普遍的調查統計，然經個別訪問的結果，知道（一）各學校對於助學運動大多數是熱烈贊助的，有的特設助學金學額，有的對接受助學金學生特加優待，不過一般的說，學校方面對於助學金的幫助，尙嫌不足，主　原因是各校本身都有困難。（二）接受助學金的學生，無分大中學校，在品行方面，一般的都有好評，勤學更爲一致具備的特點，大體上都能不負社會熱心人士的期望。</p>
<p>目前問題更顯得嚴重的是：第一，隨着物價之躍昇，一般學生負擔之增加，因爲公立學校，限於經費預算；而私立學校，開支尤爲浩大，其收入之大部份，不得不取之於學生，則下學期公私學校之增加一切費用，殆不可免。爲此，過去假定能幫助一千學生就學的助學金額，下學期所能幫助的學生人數勢必打一折扣，如果要求不减少助學名額，而適應實際需要，希望增加名額，則助學金額必須比過去大大的增加。第二，目前社會上實際情形，是一般中等家庭及薪俸階層已至無力供給子弟求學的困竭之境，此種情形，目前既無改善的可能，今後或且更將嚴重。這種情勢發展的結果，勢必造成國家與社會一種可怕的現象，即大量靑年少年之失學。這種新趨勢，逼迫我們大聲疾呼：助學運動是刻不容緩了！各界領袖允須激於國家大義而奮起倡導！</p>
<p>至於我們對於下學期的助學辦法，亦將適應前述情形，稍加改善，即除一般對小學中學大學的助學金運動以外，更可由捐款者指定專門補助在某校讀書或學習某種學科，以期捐助者的範圍更加擴大，而對於專門人才之培育，也可開闢新的途徑。同時，對於小學中學及大學的助學額，更求其可能的擴充。我們往往看到社會上一種矛盾的現象，即多數富家子弟，多不喜讀書，而貧苦子弟，則大都肯刻苦向學，多少工廠商店的學徒，又偸偸的讀書。我們熱烈期望社會上有力者富有者，能從大處遠處着眼，以多多培植他人子弟爲最大樂事，使他日爲國家社會命運所寄的有志向學的貧寒子弟們，都能獲得求學與升學的機會。我們要重複申述，廣大靑少年失學現象之日趨嚴重，是國家社會未來危機所在，而當前最迫切有效的辦法，是擴大助學運動！願各界人士積極奮起，以助其成。</p>

<h3>英美策動西班牙政變</h3>
<p>北非戰後，英美累次宣傳歐洲登陸作戰。關於英美方面所預擬的作戰計劃及反軸心軍任務，綜合各方面的報道，可要的爲如次諸點：</p>
<p>第一目的在攻略地中海上的德義根據地，即撒丁島，西西里島，克里地島，多得坎尼羣島，稜諾斯羣島的佔領作戰。其作戰計劃首先把地中海作戰地域分爲東西二水域，這諸島的攻略戰預定爲西亞及非洲的英美軍作戰之第一要務。據傳英美現正專念於計劃向歐洲本土登陸，其航空兵力則準備攻略這些島嶼，轟炸西地中海諸島。至於東地中海水域的作戰準備尙未開始，這因爲一部分從北非向敍利亞移動的空軍尙未完了的緣故。盛傳現在正在突尼西亞，埃及，敘利亞編練特殊的登陸軍隊，在突尼西亞計劃登陸的兵力是由美軍編成，而在埃及和敍利亞的登陸兵力則是由英軍及希臘軍編成。向義國作戰的軍隊暫以美軍爲主，參加突尼西亞之戰的英軍，即英第一軍第八軍向敍利亞，伊朗，伊拉克移動，在土耳其國境，與原駐西亞的兵力結合爲一大兵團，視局勢之變遷而應付，或用於巴爾幹作戰，如有必要，爲防止紅軍的南下，或將移動至阿富汗方面；而萬一印度情勢有所變化時，並立即可從此方抽調兵力應付。故英軍在西亞方面駐有大兵團取待機的態勢。</p>
<p>他們更想在西屬及法屬摩洛哥國境編組英美特殊軍，但這兵力並無特別重大的作戰意義，即從近代戰的見地看來，亦不是有力的軍隊。這軍隊的目的大概具有政治的意義，他們安挿這支軍隊在那裏的目的，企圖打倒法朗哥將軍的獨裁，支持西班牙的自由民主主義運動，樹立由親英人士所組織的新政府，或樹立王政。法屬摩洛哥目前正集合西班牙的各反對黨編組民主主義義勇軍，這也可看作道傾向的證明。</p>
<p>其次是突尼西亞戰後英美的經濟策動。突尼西亞之戰吿終後，北非突尼西亞，阿爾及利亞的亞鉛·鐵·鋼及其他鑛物資源的開發權，幾全移歸美國公司之手。將來美國資本的侵略北非，可以預斷。通向北非埃及的連絡路，木來有從達加爾　比屬剛果，而至蘇丹的非洲橫斷路綫，今後將縮成爲達加爾—阿爾及利亞—尼斯—埃及。英美資本業已計劃侵奪北非資源，不但增設原來在埃及和叙利亞的軍需工塲，據傳新的軍需工塲也正在建設中。（　：譯自六月十二日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日衆院全塲一致通過　一億決鬥打倒英美案</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日衆院今日下午一時開會後，永井柳太郞等八十餘名議員，爲適應戰局新階段，假議會宣揚日本一億國民之戰鬥總意於世界起見，乃提出一億決鬥打倒英美之決議案，當由永井柳太郞說明提案之旨趣，力言日本國民應以亞洲各民族之先驅，自任振其決鬥精神，率先垂範，以促亞洲各民族之崛起，全塲當予一致通過。該案決議如次：遵從萬古不滅之皇猷，實現八紘一宇之宏謨，掃除英美多年來對於東亞之侵略，使十億民衆各得其所，進而導世界重歸國際正義之途，以達成人類共榮之理想，此乃皇國所負之使命。際此偉大時期，帝國深感身處之地位與責任旣深且鉅，故決傾其全力，雖以達成戰爭之目的。同時日益強化與德。義暨各盟邦之聯繫，藉使東亞相互提携，期以完遂曠古罕有之大業皇軍自揭毒縣以來，迭　舉世無比之輝煌戰果，但英美方面循企圖賴自身之生產力從事反攻，以謀挽回其已敗之頹勢，故目前之戰局，正呈現將展開連續大決戰之勢，吾等確信結果必獲完全勝利，故此際一億國　急需鞏固團結，發揮大無畏之英勇精神，奮起擊滅殘暴無道之英美，以確立大東亞共榮圈，以斯貫澈爲國捐軀將士之遺志，以慰忠魂。</p>
<p>永井　明提案理由</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日衆議院十八日開會，討論「打倒英美一億決鬥決議案」時，由永井柳太郞說明提案理由，茲誌其大意如次：「自前年十二月八日宣戰大詔頒發以來，迄今巳一年有半，由于我軍將士在御稜威之下果敢奮鬥，已在東起美洲大陸，西迄馬達加斯加島，北起阿留申羣島南至澳洲大陸之廣大戰塲上，隨時隨地擊破敵軍，覆滅敵人根據地。時至今日，大東亞地域無處不見吾日旗飄揚，前爲英美荷之領土，而今歸吾軍佔領者，其面積凡一百卅萬方哩，較吾國領土大約五倍，此種偉大戰果實爲東亞歷史上所罕有，而令我一億國民深爲感激者。至于歐洲方面，敵方英美曾利用德蘇戰爭或欲包圍德國，或圖離間德義，盡其刁狡之能事，阻止德義兩國之合作，殊不知德義兩國之團結，更趨鞏固，兩國軍隊今已制壓歐洲之大半，以其規模宏大之作戰與不屈不撓之精神，與吾日本携手，共向建設世界新秩序之途猛進，東西兩方面，已爲國際正義而行崛起，此？爲世界文明史上之壯觀。大東亞戰爭出於實現新世界之理想，俾萬邦各得其所，凡人悉安其業，實惟一爲正義而起之人類解放戰爭。查吾亞洲多年來受英美帝國主義之侵略，剝奪我樺利，勒索吾資源，榨取吾勞力，東亞民族遭其殘酷蹂躪，職是之故，吾人應在亞洲擊減英美，由其暴力之解放我亞洲之民族，而建設一獨立自主之新亞洲，故大東亞戰爭之勝利，不獨決定日本之存亡，實足決定整個亞洲之興廢者。羅斯福·邱吉爾於前年在大西洋上會晤時，會發表所謂「大西洋憲章」之共同宣言，聲明英美兩國尊重政府及主權被奪之民族，根據其意志組織政府，並恢復其主權與獨立等語，然英美兩國實爲世界上最大之侵略國家，曾於過去數世紀，憑藉亞洲，非洲及美洲諸大陸之島嶼，侵略並榨取多數弱小國家，至今尙拒絕其獨立，蹂躪其主權，而今後能尊重弱小國家之獨立主權者，可謂矛盾已極，其自欺欺人，以圖逞制霸世界之野心，斷難容許，故充滿獨立自主精神之亞洲整個民族，亟應於此時崛起，協助正義之進軍，與日本並肩作戰，擊滅英美，以亞洲民族本身之奮鬥，爭取自主獨立。而吾日本國民，已爲亞洲民族總進軍之先驅，今後自應提起一億之奮鬥精神，率先撲減英美之制霸亞洲之野心，與吾日本解放亞洲之理想，決無妥協之餘地，故吾人當以凌駕英美之熱忱，竭力增强戰力爲目的，而實施產業重編，圖全國成爲一大兵工廠。余知吾國民對此必深爲感激，凡吾國民人人應與政府具同一決心，協力實現企業之整備，竭力增强戰力，因此提出「打倒英美一億決鬥決議案」，用敢提請公決。</p>

<h3>靑木大東亞相闡述　共榮圈糧食政策　各地力謀糧食自給　儘量緩和運輸困難</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相十七日下午於衆院糧食增產對策委員會中，答覆議員東鄕實氏之質問時，對日本目前糧食政策及大東亞共榮圈內中滿泰越緬菲島及南方各地糧食之生產及交流狀况作詳細之說明稱：大東亞共榮圈各地，以全域而言，糧食本足以自給，目前爲期各地域間糧食交流圓滑起見，則調整運輸實爲一根本問題，允當此戰爭期中，此項問題至爲重要，故日滿兩國咸認關於主要糧食應確立自給方針，實屬必要，因當去年滿洲國樹立第二次五年計劃時，對於增產農產物與增產煤炭均異常重視，而作最大努力。去年之農產物收獲量雖未能達理想成績，但糧食之收買成續，則較之前年良好，因此得以大豆等供給日本及以相當數量之雜糧輸往朝鮮及華北。華中方面所產小麥大致雖足以自給，然因以相當數量運往華北，故上海及其他各都市所必需之米，目前不得不仰給於南方各地，且就日本立塲以觀，日本於鐵煤棉花鹽及其他重要物資期待於華北者至鉅，因此協力解決華北糧食問題，實爲必要。華南方面，目前因和平區內大半以都市爲中心，農產地域較少，故而若不自南方地方輸入相當數量之米，則無從自給，總之，中國雖正積極謀糧食自給，但目前則尙未能達此目的。日本方面亦因栽植棉花及施行其他政策關係，故自其他地域輸入糧食以資挹注，實爲必要。此外關於運輸問題，亦須加以考慮，南方地域以全體而言，爲產米過剩區域，尤以越南泰國緬甸等地，以往輸出之米爲數甚鉅，目前正與越南泰國之間洽商以其過剩之米供給中日等國及其他必要等地之妥善，方策至於日軍政地域內各地，目前亦正力謀糧食自給，爲謀於可能範圍內儘量緩和運輸困難，故於各地同時力謀增補，以資確保糧食自給。但馬來半島方面最近期內實難達此目的，因此甚需就近自泰國方面及南方其他地域輸入粉食以資調劑，但南方其他地域中如婆羅洲等地，目前自給亦感困難，而需仰給於國外，然目前各地大致俱已積極從事增產糧食，故其前途至堪期待。緬甸方面糧食產量極豐，但因運輸關係，致未能儘量以其所餘供給其他糧食不足地域，同時就緬甸民生方面及糧食將來之觀點而言，則使緬甸减少米之產量均不適宜，因此於可能範圍內，仍使其繼續生產。總之中日滿及南方各地謀糧食自給雖屬可能，但爲調和運輸問題，日本目前所採取之糧食方針，正考慮於可能範圍內，竭力於日本國內及鄰近日本之滿洲及其他地域設法以確保糧食自給，而儘量减少自遠處輸入，因而目前施策亦根據此項方針。</p>
<h3>菲島着手組織　獨立準備委會</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十八日中央社電　菲島日派遣軍十八日十時發表如下：菲島方面日陸軍最高指揮官基於東條首相在議會中於本年內予菲島以獨立之聲明，及此後中央之指示，已命令新菲島服務團，菲島人代表組成菲島獨立委員會。</p>
<h3>宋美齡　在加拿大談話</h3>

<h3>日駐華軍　一週戰況</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍六月十八日發表一週戰况如下：自此夏季作戰以來，至六月十日，渝軍陣亡的三萬，被俘四千人，日軍奪獲大砲八七門，重機關　槍三八二挺，步槍約三千枝，收獲莫大戰果，達到目的後，即實施反轉作戰，並破壞渝軍之作戰中心，此次作戰極爲偉大，渝方認爲係進攻內地之作戰，深爲憂慮，此次突見日軍反轉，又實力强盛，故此極力作勝利之虛僞宣傳。但據七日渝方之播　：在此次作戰中已切實深感渝軍矛盾問題，此誠爲其難以隱瞞之事實。據自渝方歸來者談：內地之川軍，因待遇上劣於中央軍，頗爲不滿，全部川軍中充滿不穩之預兆，又浙江省渝方員五十軍之一部，亦因待遇理由，巳發生動搖，渝方一向漠視此等地方，每藉勢力予以壓迫，目前各地已陸續發生不穩狀態，渝方對統率方面，誡爲一莫大困難。</p>

<p>華北特輯</p>
<h3>日對華新政策與華北情勢</h3>
<p>（北京特電）繼中國參戰之後，日本展開對華新政策，此在華北當地有何影　？如何使之具體化？以及新政策所委該於華北之自主的參職體制之　發展如何？茲綜合當地諸情勢　羹各方面之見解，略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）大體言之，日本對華政策之精神，在華北中日當局及民間業已完全貫澈。政治·經濟·文化各方面諸具體施策。正由中日雙方安民告示切合作而積極推進，漸七軌道。</p>
<p>（二）但因日本之認爾　實行對華新政策，致在當初中日人士咸未能把握新政策之眞議。中國方面對以參戰之嚴肅事實　爲前提而賦以自主性之事，並不如以深　切反省，日方亦同樣　無　抱悲　論者視新政策爲從中國之後退。對此點今後尙須努力貫澈　新政策的眞義。</p>
<p>（三）實施新政策後　中國方面自主性之擴大，在遂行大東亞戰爭上自有其限度　及緩急先後，中國方面應充分加以反省。日方亦應採取妥善措置，以合理的處理諸且體施策。華北之參範體制，因此問題之解決而　愈强化。</p>
<p>（四）所謂華馮特殊性問題，惟由華北對戰爭之貢獻此一最高命題始可解決。華北特殊性所具之原有水準，在擴大發展至全中國在大東亞國中之特　殊時期，自無理由僅繼續而存在。但今日中國之情勢　全中國尙未打成一片，並未題示對大　東亞戰有所貢獻之充分發展，因此，華北特殊性不能不依然存在。</p>
<p>（五）國民政府之進　出結北　亦應以前述至高命題爲前提。如急欲使華北中央化，轉致妨害華北對日之貢獻而使民心大安，與中共以可乘之機。幸而迄今爲止之國府態度極爲愼重，急激的中央化工作頗爲謹愼。</p>
<p>記者來北京，　時受中日人士之質問稱：「中國之自主性，具體上容認至何程度？以强化國民政府爲目標之　華北中央化及華北特殊性之限界如何？」解決佌問題之關鍵，全在於華北之對日貢獻此一大　提上，無論政治問題，經濟問題，總之，當地一切施策，爲適應此最高命題，應集中於能認主義。</p>
<p>日本對華新政策，決非强使中國　荷重任。中日合作之基礎，不能是以能率主義爲軸心的平　分担主義。重要資源之開發，交通，通信等諸事業所　屬之龐大資本及偉秀技術，仍須依賴日本之供給，因而不能不承認日本之主　性。擊破重慶及中共之較事，今後亦愈加重要。</p>
<p>至於民生政策方面，自應使中國方面之自主的活動旺盛　起來；促進其完成參戰　中國之使命，新政策方針被充分瞭解後，華北派遺軍祇有野戰軍之任務，除作戰警備以外，一切全應放手，新民會中日方議員亦見大　量退出，殘留者以顧問資格　立於與中國協力之立塲。至於經濟方面，生活必需物資之物價，及販賣配給，均置於華方機關　物資物價處理委員會之一元編制下，日方僅以其下部機構之一單位　而參與計劃。凡此種種，均　於新政策而有顯著轉變，就華方而言，係自主性之擴大。</p>
<p>總之，今後當地重要課題之一，爲中日分担主義之俁理的實施，而在其成果上加强中日之積極合作。</p>
<p>華北之特殊懷，且有三重性，一方面量北爲防共第一綫，而另一面華北乃中日　　經濟關係之中心。人中國本身，歷史上，地理上形成與畢中華南不同的轟域，國府之參戰，　目標當然擴大此種問題全中國，但中國之現實，決非僅用參戰口號所能解決，難關重重。不僅因尙踐剩中其，重慶勢力之故　而特　性之全中國化爲不可能，即國府治不本體之問題上亦深具此感。率言之，華北政治爲臨時　政府之延晨的色彩頗濃，在經濟上，通貨方面所顯示之聯銀劵　及儲備劵之界限極淸。據强化國民政府以統一全中國之　地看來，雖遲早必須加以修正，但現實問題上終非如此間單。</p>
<p>關於華北中央化問題，中國某有力者　向記者表示意見如左：</p>
<p>華北之中央化自是甚佳，但在其前担任華北　政治者爲華北政治家，保以可厭呢？華北政治家第一必須檢討是否　缺乏担任華北政治之能力？其次　顯檢討國府中何人可担任華北政治，其人果能受華北　衆之支持，而實施較現在爲優之政治嗎？</p>
<p>此恐是代表　華北一般的意見之言。最近在上海所引起的囤積問題，更加甚此疑問。對於測騐國府政治力之諸重要　事件之處理，不能不希望國府　加以深切的考慮。大東亞戰今正在存亡決戰之秋，兵站基地之華北，不容有瞵間之混亂，期待國府之自强勿以無理之政治力　滲　於華北。（翔：譯自六月七日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>華北參戰經濟的改組　糧食增產與物價抑制</h3>
<p>（天津特電八日中村特派員發）因國民政府的參戰及日本實施對華新政策，華北經濟發生了歷　的軸變。各種經濟施策。出於民生政策的要求，並爲對日協力的基礎，正在着着具體實現，故華北參戰濟所負的使命，極爲重大。華中華北交交易的調整，食物，物價等問題亦憶上軌道。自大東亞戰爭後，華北因與世界市塲隔絕，故對華中的米，麵粉，維糧等頗致期待，而華中則需華北的煤的接濟，也頗殷切，故雙方互和依存的關係，急激地密切起來。是以華中華北物資交流切起來。是以華中華北物資交流的賀滑化，遂成爲當前切要的課題。先前在上海舉行的華中華北交易促進協義會　即基於此種要求而樹劃時期的方針。</p>
<p>該會議所決定的重要方針，以華北的煤與華中　的麵粉相交換。今後華中華北交　時，仍維持儲備劵聯銀券　十八元的匯率，至特別圓及申匯則維持態狀。</p>
<p>唯於此須注意者，調整華中華北的物資時，華中方面經由全國商業統制總會，而華北方面則經由華北交易編制總會，但全國商業統制總會　不僅在華中調整輸往華北的物資，且一元地統制華中物資物收購　給，更將在天津及廣東設立該會的分會，以打破華中，華北，華南的地域經濟爲其基本方針，但　華北方面的意向看來，至少暫將止於設立華北的統制會。華中華北的關係，跟着其政治方面　的接近而並行，自是必然的趨勢，但其實施時，當然是逐步的，漸進的，因爲在華北本身的決戰　體制的確立上，尙存在着許多應　予解決的課題，即第一是食糧問題，第二是物價問題。民生若不能安定，則華北資源的開發，增產即不可能，華北現在固然一步步克服　累積不來的困難問題，進而整備決戰體制，但抑低物價及　食糧自給則是今後華北增强生產的基礎。</p>
<p>華北政務委員會前已設置華北物價處理委員會，糧食管理局，並在其監督　下設立糧食速運社於各朋各省各特別市，以期確保輸入前糧食，增加地塲生產，並確立收買機構。</p>
<p>至於物價騰貴問題，最近更爲題著，無論在安定民生上，收組參戰經濟的工作上，希望從速　擬安定之策。</p>
<p>物價騰貴的最近的原因，乃因消戰階級的　搜購　及因難於獲得食糧而致物物交換運動盛行。糧食管理局及華北　物價物資處理委員會設物資平衡資金　運用委員會，一元的處理物資物資對策，更在華北中央物　價協力會壟中國方面的物價協力會　取得密切聯絡，向確立戰時物價政策邁進。實施新政策後的華北　所遭遇的事態，僅物價問題即已　極爲困難重大。打破此難局，充分發揮北政務委員會的政治力，而逐一遂行對變政策後的諸經濟施策，是爲目前所謂於華北　最重要的課題，是華北的使命。（翔：譯自六月十日四部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日軍發言人　發表談話</h3>
<p>日本在滬陸軍部報道部發言人，昨日發表談話，謂本月十六日，日本舉行議會席上，東條首相所發表演說，意義重大，自最近以來，渝方大受徇動。且渝方軍事發言人於十七日發表文吿，對東條首相發言，顯有感受衝動。此次東條首相之演說中所謂，日本發動大東亞戰爭，乃將百年來英美侵略東亞予以撲滅，且將東亞在英美壓迫下，予以解放。日不惜一切，爲大東亞努力推進任務，而和日本協力者，有中國，緬甸，菲律賓等，且東條首相特別提出，透示緬菲獨立機會，迅將成熟，以是各方頗爲注目，尤以渝方大感衝動。且最近有渝方頗負重要地位及孚有聲望之龐炳勛將軍，來歸參加，汪主席令導下之和平運動，此乃顯著事實，渝軍事發言人發表文吿，認爲係受威脅，且提及龐炳勛將軍，孫殿英將軍，榮子恒將軍之歸來，非爲本人自願。今事實昭彰，龐將軍躬親乘機晋京拜謁主席，並拜會各院部，且發表談話，故渝方之揑詞聳德，殊不値談至。關於此次羅邱會議，我人雖未得其詳，至少二種提案，未能決定，有主張於歐洲作戰者，有主張於太平洋作戰者，爭持未已。相互利用，無從談到團結聯繫。然渝方之被作犧牲，英美無非利用其根地，在渝方本身則毫無利益可言。即以最近美國在議會提出撤廢禁止華人移民法案，表面上已取得同意，不過對撤廢一節，全爲目前一時之現象，美對渝方並無有眞正誠意，事實上雖有此種態度，亦僅戰時之利用而已，是乃美欺騙渝方之策略，此次協約國紀念日，渝方之遭受利用，愚弄其本身，猶未得知，且並豐懸三十二種國旗，自以爲榮，是項烏合之衆，猶未知三十二國之外，尙有實力龐大之國家乎？恐不久在三十二種旗幟上，預料將添懸白旗，等到此時，此大言不漸之舉，當不堪設想。再以此次美在渝之負責人吏蒂威爾，山美返渝後，即會見西人記者團，發表美議院對渝之戰况，表示關心，對渝作相當之準備，及如何强化，並謂美在渝之十四航空部隊，積極與渝陸上部隊合作作戰，以表示强調及對今後作戰之如何推進，惟此次可在洞庭湖及宜昌以觀，已可表現美渝作戰合作之程度，其結果非但毫無效果，且遭受慘敗再再簡單舉述自五月一日起至六月六日渝美飛機出動共計一二七次，前後作空襲蠢動出發飛機二二二架，在此時期之戰果，爲日軍繫落者十七架，同時被繫滅毀損者二十二架。是項統計之數，尙未有報吿而未統計包括在內。然在此項戰况中，渝美空軍與日空軍相較，顯有天壞之別，美難與日空軍作戰，蓋日空軍之優秀資態，由於良好準備及長時期之訓練，且一再繫毀美渝空軍，益足表現日空優勢無遺又謂：如美渝空軍之合作，雖未能斷定無可連擊，但渝軍之不願美空軍戰佔光，及不願奉行美指揮官之使命，絕不願在美指揮下作戰，故美渝空軍旣無充分合作誠意，更妄談效果何在矣云云</p>
<h3>廣田部長　發表談話</h3>
<p>日大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部長昨發表談話</p>
<p>開發物資</p>
<p>廣田部長首先述東條首相演講　旨，以大東亞其檾圈組織問題及對大東亞共榮圈基本之緊密組織，羹說明在此次議會已決議法案，以整理日本國內之產業及集合開發南洋與中國境內之物資，用以强化戰力，此次議會討論目的，在組織大東亞政治經濟使之如何能組成基本問題，尤對中國特別重視支援中國經濟政治力量，且日本已準備調整中日兩國所締　之各種條約，以加强中日兩國協力之關繫，此外，並對菲律賓亦加說明，將於本年內予以獨立，並對頃甸問題謂，於本年五月八日，先成立獨立準備委員會，一俟準備就緒，即可自治，同時對於荷印問題爪哇人民獲得參政，</p>
<p>地或組織</p>
<p>故東條演講之純正意義，及施行政策之何在，當在乎大地域國家組織問題，換言之，即以大地域之集團組織及大地域國家羣之組織。廣由情報部長繼謂：爲何日本提倡大地域國家組織，其原因在目今之國際情勢而觀，以按照戰時準備武力糧食而言，小的國家，將難存在，便如在一五一九年首次歐戰完畢時間，粵大利國已吿破產，奧之幅員狹小，而人口八百萬且多數集居維也納京城，毫無生產能力，即使仰賴農業而生活，但在經濟上，亦不能得以獨立。</p>
<p>古今軍事</p>
<p>再就軍事觀點上言，由近代武器與戰略之日新月異，大國與小國之力量相去懸殊，降至今日，其物咨與工業之發達，及作戰戰略之發展，已至最大規模狀態，飛機每小時行七百公里，一旦作戰開始，小國即遭受大國之茶毒，在一九三年時，德與波蘭戰爭在開始作戰一星期，波蘭即被解決，由此觀之，吾人可以明瞭在廣大地域內對經濟軍事方面，應有充分之糧食及工業資源是爲最重要之問題。。</p>
<p>强化戰力</p>
<p>關於日國內工業再編制之意義，日本有負保衛大東亞共榮圈之職責，必須加强戰力從而充實保衛作戰之力量，其中煤油一項，在大東亞共榮圈內，豐富異常，大須加緊權續開發，至今今日陸海軍武力，及輕重工業，乃爲保衛大東亞之主力。</p>

<h3>切望各界本一貫精神　贊助申報五屆助学　捐款愈多受惠青年愈衆本屆需款數字當必龐大</h3>
<p>第五屆申報讀者助學金，定七月一日開始申請，各項手續，已在準備。連日接各生函詢辦法者，日有數起，在此學校正在老試時期，切望各生注意於成績之精進，果屬淸寒優秀，自必可獲得本報助金。</p>
<p>携帶證件親來領表</p>
<p>至本屆助金申謂章程，應俟本報屆期公告，申請學生，必須親自携帶證件，來館領表，不得倩人代領，函索一律不應，因病或署期離滬返籍者亦須備有學校當局證明函件，方可照發。但在甌別老試時未能趕到應試者，取銷申請資格。</p>
<p>助學需要較前殷切</p>
<p>木報感於助學事宜，以歷屆辦理經過言，次屆必較上屆尤爲要要，其原因當爲生計之日蹙，但其中必有若干學生，如無助學金之補助，或早已輟學二三年矣。故助學金如能得各界永久一貫之輸助，此中所造就之人材，將不計其數。且本報確信支村助學金一元於清寒優秀之靑年，其效果必較紈袴子弟浪費十元百元爲大。故助學金之支出愈鉅，即本報所得之安慰愈深，亦即社會互助之功能愈顯。同人願以寒署無間之決心，爲慷慨捐輸之各界人士供奔走之勞，爲清寒學子請命終各界之前，捐款愈多，受惠愈廣，造就愈大，同人之願，亦學子之望也。</p>
<p>言歡之間不忘清寒</p>

<p>昨收助金</p>
<p>昨日收到之助學金台銜列下：吳中一二千元，費企和（爲其女公子肇筠彌月之喜節約湯餅宴費）一千元，徐勒愼堂。朱池深各二百元，公記一百念元，森林（稿酬）念元，沈鍾。（稿酬）王家杰。（稿酬）各十六元，勵志中學（木學期內學生拾遺）七元，共收儲劵三千五百七十九元，結存四十五萬三千八百三十一元五角九分。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>今後小銀行</h3>
<p>由於財政部決定整理各小銀行，規定資本額非在三百萬元償還不得營業，於是各小銀行今後的出路，只有兩途：就是「增資」和「合併」。這種措施，從整個金融機構上講，當然是有良好影響的。</p>
<p>不過，我們覺得規定銀行資本額，固然是十分重要，而銀行業務之檢察，尤非特別注意不可，不論銀行之範團如何，資本如何，如果其經營業務，不由正軌，則資本奪多，爲害愈大，其鏟果適成反比例，可不深懼？</p>
<p>政府爲改善金融，助益民生，苦心孤詣地規定這個辦法，銀行自應善體此意，盡力協助，才能產生偉大的效果。我們一念及今日災鴻進野，民生凋敝之情形，安得不惕然以驚，實行自然？</p>
<p>自肅之道多端：消極方面言，自然不做不正當之營業，積極方面言，更須協助政府開發生產事業，以使民生復蘇。最近所傳銀錢業紛紛組織貸款銀團，投資生產事業，不論其投資途徑如何，農村貸款也好，工業貸款也好，凡有利社會國家經濟前途的，都値得我們欣喜和稱頌。</p>
<p>我們深信，今日之銀行行界，唯有投資生產事業，其基礎才能穏固，同時也相信，唯有官民合作，努力推動，而後銀行事業始有偉大成果。當此國家多難之秋，負調劉金融責任的銀行界，宜如何自肅自勉，多所建樹，以慰社會民衆喁喁之望！</p>
<h3>商統會昨通過　小麥統買暫行方案　實行統一收買小麥</h3>
<p>全國商業統制部會，於昨日召開理監事聯席會議，通過小麥統買暫行方案，並由該會即日呈請行政院核示，惟以時期迫切，不容再緩，已諭知粉麥業委員會，先行按照新定方案，着手進行，將來如奉院令，或有修正之處，再行另函知照。</p>
<h3>小麥統買暫行方案</h3>
<p>共分十要，另行刋載今日本欄，可參閱。</p>
<p>集中管理買暫系統</p>
<p>該方案中集中管理小麥買賣系統，規定集中地麥行，向產地收買，售給委託及販實商，委託商可將買得小麥賣　麵　廠，甲地區販賣商。則可將收買之小麥，販賣給乙地區委託商，乙地區販賣商。可將收買之小麥，販賣給甲地區委託商。質言之即各地區麵　廠所　小麥原料，均可向各地區委託商購買，委託商則直接向各地區販賣商，及集中地麥行收買小麥。</p>
<p>設分支辦事處地點</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會粉麥專業委員會暫設分支辦事處地點，決定分辦事處者：計上海，蘇州，無錫，常州，鎭江，泰縣，南京，蕪湖，蚌埠九處。設支辦事處者：計杭州，崑山，常熟，太倉，江陰，丹陽，戚墅堰，奔牛，揚州，高郵，寶應，榛潼，姜堰，興化，東台，南通，滁縣，廬州，安慶，明光等二十處。</p>
<h3>中儲限制　貼現放款辦法</h3>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>華股昨轉入盤旋中，此起彼落，頗不一致。公用業之華商電氣，在急遞挺進中，閘北水電買意轉淡，反稍微降，南烟公司升近大關，大中華火柴軋平。康元製罐緊站於大關外。文化業中華書局獨趨商務，新藥業中法迂迴微　，新亞平疲，紡織業仍因紗價而趨堅，永安組織一度又出大關，後見回下。大生一三兩廠求過於供；信和紗廠新股小挫。白貨業起伏最鉅，永安新新均稍盤升，中國內衣與景福衫襪低價不乏買戶。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>醬業　醬園業醬色業醬號業三公會奉令合併爲醬業同業公會，茲悉該會已於一昨假寗波同鄕會舉行成立大會，到會員一百四十餘人，又各當局復派代表蒞臨列席，行禮如儀後，復選出蔡圓夫方仲甫沈中揚等士一人爲理事，宋爕麟陳雨亭等七人爲監事。</p>
<p>茶食業　上海區茶食業同業公會，假市商會開成立大會，有關當局出度指導，當塲通過會章，及票選首屆理監事。結果黃景岐李國治許榮森等十三人爲理事，周未星吳淸戴等三人爲監事。</p>
<h3>小麥統買暫行方案　全國商業統制總會訂定</h3>
<p>糧食政策在戰時體制下推行之重要，自不符言，爲軍需之確保，民食之足給，必須有健全之機構，周密之設計，官商通力合作，强化供求管理，方克有濟，惟欲達其目的。則增加生產，實爲第一要義。</p>
<p>麵粉爲主食糧，而麵粉之足給，端在小麥之增產，華中爲產麥晨豐之區域，亦爲麵粉廠集中之所在，就以往情形而論。小麥收獲之數量，並不敷各廠之需求，因未有精確之統計，無從斷定其農產量興收買量之比率，現在關於增加農產計劃，如推廣警確，保護貸款，及技術改良等，糧食部已在積極進行，幫農產之增加，定可收效，無盤　言。但關於大量收買充實倉儲，尙等極大之努力，蓋戰事發生以還，環境複雜，移動維艱，貨物不易集中，若再抑制其價格，使農民生沽，不能取給，於其農作物之代價，麵粉廠之原料，必致受有影響，爲求提高收買之成結果爲顧全物價之平衡，爰　定小麥收買方案，十條如左：</p>
<p>（一）平均配給集體生產。各麵粉廠應受　給小麥之數量，經本會按照各廠生產能力比　　擬定，由各廠依照擬定數量，指定委託商採辦，不午溢額。（二）確定收買系統集中管理。爲集中管理，擬定買賣系統。（三）便利採　集中來源。凡由農村鄉鎭採運至　集中地市塲者，絕對自由，使小麥集中市塲。（四）防止投機囤積，取締同等地位間之互買賣。爲補充第二條規定，藉以防止投機囤積起見，應取締同等地位間之　互相買賣。（一）同一集地之麥行，不得　互相買賣。（二）委託商之間，不得作互相買賣。（三）　賣商之間，不得作互相買賣。（四）麵粉商不得賣國賊　出小賣。（五）委託商販賣商集中地，麥行所收買而未售出之小麥，　某一限期內本會得估價全部　收買，配給於各麵粉廠。（五）辦理登記完成精確統計：統計爲統制之初步工作，而登記尤爲必要手續，小麥產地區域遼闊，情形覆雜，欲求辦理週詳非短期內所能見　效爲易於入手起見登記手續，先辦已入市場小麥之登記，漸次推及於未入市塲小麥之登記。凡小麥到達集中地市塲。須詳實登記。（包括數量·價格·存放·移動售與販賣商或委託商牌　）其手續由集中地麥行辦理之，凡由販賣商，販運登記麥至需要地區者，須於運出及運　地　分別詳實登記，（包括風購自行名，膺買價格，就量，轉運地點目的），其手續由販賣商辦理之，凡麵粉廠購　小麥須詳實登記（包括數景價格，委託商行名，）其解到及存放外棧手續亦同，凡委託商向販賣商購進或售與麵粉廠，均須辦理登記。（包括數量價格，購自販賣商之牌號或售與麵粉廠　之廠名，及存放地點，）上項登記表冊，由本會分別印製，凡經　小麥業務者，可就近向本會或分支辦事處依或塡報，並由本會飛集報吿製成統計。（六）普遍設立分支辦事處，加强收買機構，於產麥主要及次要地區，普遍設立分支辦事處，督促管理各收買機構，集中並强化收買事宜暫設分支　辦事處地點，（七）規定收買機構之資格登記及業務範團，凡在前條規定本會所設分支辦事處　各地之麵粉廠，及具有經管小麥業務資格者，均須按照下列規定，向就近本會，或各該地分支辦事處登記：（甲）麵粉廠　凡爲各地區麵粉業同業公會製造組會員向本會　登配者，得向本會請求配給小麥其配給方法，由本會擬定數量，各廠依據其數量買收　並遵守左列各項規定（一）依照本會之分配數量採辦之，不得溢額收買（二）每日收進之小麥，其價格數量，均應按日報吿本會，或分支辦事處，（三）各廠之小麥，均由各該廠指定委託商經辦，但須將指定之委託商報吿本會查核，必要時本會得令其改換，或撤銷之，（四）各廠不得面集中地　麥行或販督商及農民直接收買。（乙）委託商。凡爲各地區　雜糧業同業公會會員　經麵粉廠指定一會登配者，得按照委麵粉廠指定之數量，由販　商及集中地（即本會設立分支辦事處地方）麥行收買，並遵守左列　項規定：（一）應向本會登記，（二）須爲各地雜糧業　同業會會員（三）受麵粉廠之委託　向販賣商或集中地麥行收買小麥，（四）每日收買情形　及解廠　小麥數量。應按日報吿　本會，或　地　分支辦事處，（五）不得　向農民　直接收奧秘，（六）不得與其他委託商　互相買賣，（七）收購　之小麥，必須完全交與委託　之　粉廠，不得轉售他人，（八）委託商不　兼營集中地麥行。（丙）販實商：凡具有雜糧業同業公會會員之資格者，均得爲販賣商。但必須向採取地分支　辦事處登記後，方得向集中地麥行採辦　小麥販運至需要地區，（　有　粉廠之所在地區）不得囤積，並須遵守左列各項規定：（一）應向採辦地分支辦事感登記，（二）須爲各地雜糧業同業公會會員，（三）販運小麥應爲集中地　麥行已登配之小麥，（四）不得將販運之小麥售與當地，必須運往目的地經委託商轉售與　粉廠，（五）採販小麥應按日向採販中分支辦事處報吿。（六）不得販賣未登配之小麥，（七）不得與　　其他販賣商互相買賣，（六）不得轉售與業外人，（丁）集中地麥行：凡爲各該地雜糧業　同業公會會員，向各該地分支　辦事處登主者，爲集中　麥行得　向農民或兩近鄕鎭不須向本會登記之麥行　直接收買售與販賣商及委託商，並須遵守左列各項規定：（一）應向分支辦事處登記，（二）須爲當地雜粳業同業公會會員，（三）司向農民或兩近鄕鎭，不須向本會登記之麥行直接收買（四）收進小麥，得售與販賣商或委託商，但不得直接售與麫粉廠，（五）每日收買售出情形，應按日報吿分支辦事處，（六）不得轉售與業外人及突集中地麥行　互相買賣，麫粉廠委託商販賣商，及麥行對本條規定均應切實遵守，如有違反時，立即取消　會員資格，並嚴行處罰，其罰則由本會呈請政府核准施行之，（八）實施調整方策後和競爭行爲，某一麫粉廠未能滿足其核定之收買量時，經調查屬寶，有正當理由者對其分配比例，由本會作有效之調整，遇總收買量發生不足時，全部麫粉廠之配給量，按比列遞减之，麫粉廠騐收小麥，應嚴格執行，剷除競買攙另之惡習（九）議定適書合理價格獎勵農村生產：爲獎勵農村生產增加收買數量，對於水麥及　粉之價格，由本會參的酌　櫄及製造之成本給予相當相潤，擬議合理價格，呈請政府核定之，（十）不因時制宜行方案由粉麥專業委員會擬訂，呈請全國商業統制總會理事會議決通濃呈報政府備案。</p>

<h3>Re-discussing the Student Aid Movement</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's student aid program for the next semester has now begun fundraising. Looking back at the achievements of the past four sessions (please refer to this newspaper's issue on the 16th), we deeply feel the following points: First, the increase in the number of donors and the increase in the amount of donations in each session prove that there are indeed many insightful and enthusiastic people in society. As soon as they see the student aid movement start, they are willing to donate enthusiastically to help the country and society cultivate talents. Second, from the students who have received student aid in the past, we can see several characteristics: (1) The number of applicants is almost ten times the actual power we can provide for student aid, which also shows that there are many young people in society who are ambitious but out of school. (2) The grades of the young people taking the exams are generally sufficient, and their aspirations are particularly encouraging, and it is felt that there are indeed many promising talents among the majority of out-of-school youth. (3) Among the young people taking the exams, many are children of civil servants and middle-class families. In principle, they should not accept student aid, but in reality, their parents are indeed unable to afford their schooling. Third, in terms of schools, although we have not yet conducted a thorough and general survey and statistics, we know from individual interviews that (1) most schools enthusiastically support the student aid movement. Some have specially set up student aid quotas, and some have given special preferential treatment to students who receive student aid, but generally speaking, the schools' help for student aid is still insufficient, mainly because the schools themselves have difficulties. (2) Students who receive student aid, regardless of whether they are in universities or middle schools, generally receive good reviews in terms of character, and diligence is a consistent characteristic. On the whole, they can live up to the expectations of enthusiastic people in society.</p>
<p>Currently, the problem is becoming more serious: First, with the soaring of prices and the increase in the burden on students in general, because public schools are limited by budget; and private schools have particularly large expenses, and most of their income has to be taken from students, it is almost inevitable that all fees will increase in public and private schools next semester. For this reason, the amount of student aid that could previously help 1,000 students go to school will inevitably be discounted in the number of students that can be helped next semester. If you want to not reduce the number of student aid places and meet actual needs, and hope to increase the number of places, the amount of student aid must be greatly increased compared to the past. Second, the current actual situation in society is that ordinary middle-class families and salaried classes have reached the point where they are unable to afford their children's education. There is currently no possibility of improving this situation, and it may become even more serious in the future. The result of this trend will inevitably create a terrible phenomenon in the country and society, that is, a large number of young people dropping out of school. This new trend forces us to loudly call out: The student aid movement is urgent! Leaders from all walks of life must be motivated by national righteousness and rise up to advocate for it!</p>
<p>As for our student aid methods for the next semester, we will also make some improvements in response to the aforementioned situation, that is, in addition to the general student aid movement for elementary schools, middle schools, and universities, donors can also specify to specifically subsidize students studying or learning certain subjects in a certain school, in order to expand the scope of donors and open up new avenues for the cultivation of specialized talents. At the same time, we will seek to expand the student aid quotas for elementary schools, middle schools, and universities as much as possible. We often see a contradictory phenomenon in society, that is, most children from wealthy families do not like to study, while children from poor families mostly study hard, and many apprentices in factories and shops secretly study. We sincerely hope that powerful and wealthy people in society can take a broad and long-term view and take cultivating other people's children as the greatest pleasure, so that those ambitious and hardworking children from poor families who are entrusted with the fate of the country and society in the future can all obtain the opportunity to study and go to higher education. We want to repeat that the increasingly serious phenomenon of large numbers of young people dropping out of school is a future crisis for the country and society, and the most urgent and effective way to address this is to expand the student aid movement! We hope that people from all walks of life will actively rise up and help it succeed.</p>
<p>Commentary and Analysis</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Orchestrated Coup in Spain</h3>
<p>After the North African war, the United Kingdom and the United States repeatedly propagated a European landing operation. Based on reports from various sources regarding the Anglo-American plan for the operation and the mission of the anti-Axis forces, the key points are as follows:</p>
<p>The primary objective is to capture the German and Italian bases in the Mediterranean, namely the occupation of Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, the Dodecanese Islands, and the Lemnos Islands. The operational plan initially divides the Mediterranean combat area into eastern and western waters. The capture of these islands is designated as the top priority for Anglo-American forces operating in West Asia and Africa. It is reported that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently focusing on planning a landing on the European mainland, with their air forces preparing to capture these islands and bomb the western Mediterranean islands. Preparations for operations in the eastern Mediterranean waters have not yet begun, as the air force partially transferred from North Africa to Syria has not yet completed its relocation. It is widely rumored that special landing forces are currently being trained in Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria. The forces planning to land in Tunisia are composed of American troops, while the landing forces in Egypt and Syria are composed of British and Greek troops. The forces operating against Italy are temporarily dominated by American troops. The British troops participating in the Tunisian campaign, namely the British 1st and 8th Armies, are moving to Syria, Iran, and Iraq, where they will combine with the forces originally stationed in West Asia in Turkish territory to form a large army corps. This corps will respond to changes in the situation, either for operations in the Balkans or, if necessary, to prevent the southward advance of the Red Army, or will be moved to the Afghan region. In the event of any changes in the situation in India, troops can be immediately drawn from this area to respond. Therefore, the British army has a large army corps stationed in West Asia in a waiting posture.</p>
<p>They also want to organize Anglo-American special forces in the Spanish and French Moroccan borders, but these forces have no particularly significant combat significance, that is, from the perspective of modern warfare, they are not powerful troops. The purpose of this army is probably of political significance. The purpose of their deployment there is to overthrow General Franco's dictatorship, support the free and democratic movement in Spain, and establish a new government organized by pro-British figures, or to establish a monarchy. French Morocco is currently gathering various Spanish opposition parties to form a democratic volunteer army, which can also be seen as proof of this tendency.</p>
<p>The second is the Anglo-American economic manipulation after the Tunisian war. After the end of the Tunisian war, the rights to develop zinc, iron, steel, and other mineral resources in North Africa's Tunisia and Algeria were almost entirely transferred to American companies. It can be predicted that American capital will invade North Africa in the future. The connecting route to North Africa and Egypt originally ran from Dakar through the Belgian Congo to Sudan, but in the future it will be shortened to Dakar-Algeria-Nice-Egypt. Anglo-American capital has already planned to seize North African resources, not only adding new military factories to the original ones in Egypt and Syria, but it is also reported that new military factories are also under construction.

At this moment, the Japanese government is determined to stand at the forefront of one hundred million compatriots, based on the traditional Japanese spirit of loyalty, and do its utmost to achieve the practical effect of increasing harvest and strengthening war capacity, so that the loyal and brave soldiers of the Japanese army have no worries and can fully exert their combat power, in order to advance along the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. Upon accepting this resolution, we merely reiterate the above determination of the Japanese government, and pledge to fight alongside all citizens to inherit the will of the soldiers who have died for their country, to annihilate the United Kingdom and the United States, and to strive for victory, so as to reassure the Emperor.</p>
<h3>House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong" Resolution</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - At the House of Representatives meeting this afternoon, more than eighty members, including Yuta Nagai, proposed a resolution to "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong" in order to proclaim the total war intention of the one hundred million Japanese people to the world in response to the new phase of the war situation. Yuta Nagai explained the purpose of the proposal, emphasizing that the Japanese people should take the lead in demonstrating their fighting spirit as the pioneers of the Asian nations in order to promote the rise of the Asian nations. The entire House unanimously passed the resolution. The resolution reads as follows: In accordance with the eternal Imperial Way and to realize the grand plan of Hakkō ichiu, to eliminate the aggression of the United Kingdom and the United States against East Asia for many years, to allow the one billion people to obtain their proper place, and to guide the world back to international justice, in order to achieve the ideal of human co-prosperity, this is the mission entrusted to the Imperial Country. At this great moment, the Empire deeply feels that its position and responsibilities are profound and significant. Therefore, it is determined to devote all its efforts to achieve the objectives of the war. At the same time, it will increasingly strengthen its ties with Germany, Italy, and other allied countries, so that East Asia can cooperate with each other to complete this unprecedented great undertaking. Since the outbreak of the war, the Imperial Army has repeatedly achieved unparalleled brilliant results, but the United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to rely on their own production capacity to carry out counterattacks in order to salvage their defeated decline. Therefore, the current war situation is presenting the momentum of continuous major decisive battles. We are convinced that the result will be complete victory. Therefore, at this moment, one hundred million people urgently need to consolidate their unity, develop their fearless spirit of heroism, rise up to annihilate the brutal and inhumane United Kingdom and the United States, establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and thoroughly fulfill the will of the soldiers who have died for their country, in order to comfort the loyal souls.</p>
<p>Nagai Explains the Reasons for the Proposal</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - During the House of Representatives meeting on the 18th to discuss the "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong Resolution," Yuta Nagai explained the reasons for the proposal. The gist of his explanation is recorded as follows: "It has been a year and a half since the Imperial Rescript declaring war was issued on December 8th of the year before last. Thanks to the courageous struggles of our military soldiers under the Imperial authority, enemy forces have been defeated and enemy bases have been destroyed anytime, anywhere in the vast battlefields extending from the American continent in the east to Madagascar in the west, and from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Australian continent in the south. Today, the Japanese flag can be seen flying everywhere in the Greater East Asia region. The area formerly belonging to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands and now occupied by our army is 1.3 million square miles, approximately five times the size of our country's territory. These great achievements are truly rare in the history of East Asia, and deeply appreciated by our one hundred million citizens. As for the European front, the enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, have used the German-Soviet war to either surround Germany or attempt to alienate Germany and Italy, exhausting their cunning abilities to prevent cooperation between the two countries. However, the unity of Germany and Italy has become even more consolidated. The troops of the two countries have now suppressed most of Europe. With their large-scale operations and indomitable spirit, they are joining hands with Japan to advance toward the path of building a new world order. Both the East and the West have risen up for international justice. This is a magnificent spectacle in the history of world civilization. The Greater East Asia War arose from the ideal of realizing a new world, so that all nations can obtain their proper place and all people can live in peace. It is truly the only war of human liberation that arose for justice. For many years, our Asia has suffered from the aggression of British and American imperialism, which has deprived us of our forests, extorted our resources, and exploited our labor. The East Asian nations have been cruelly trampled upon. Therefore, we should defeat the United Kingdom and the United States in Asia, liberate the nations of Asia from their violence, and build a new, independent Asia. Therefore, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will not only determine the survival of Japan, but will also determine the rise and fall of the entire Asia. When Roosevelt and Churchill met on the Atlantic Ocean the year before last, they issued a joint declaration called the "Atlantic Charter," stating that the United Kingdom and the United States respect the nations whose governments and sovereignty have been seized, and will organize governments according to their will and restore their sovereignty and independence. However, the United Kingdom and the United States are the largest aggressor countries in the world. In the past centuries, they have relied on islands in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to invade and exploit many small and weak countries. To this day, they still refuse to grant them independence and trample on their sovereignty. It is extremely contradictory to say that they will respect the independent sovereignty of small and weak countries in the future. Their self-deception in an attempt to achieve their ambition to dominate the world cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the entire nation of Asia, full of the spirit of independence and autonomy, should rise up at this time to assist the righteous advance, fight alongside Japan, and annihilate the United Kingdom and the United States. With the struggle of the Asian nations themselves, we will strive for autonomy and independence. Our Japanese people have been the pioneers of the total march of the Asian nations. In the future, we should raise the fighting spirit of one hundred million people, take the lead in suppressing the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to dominate Asia, and our ideal of liberating Asia has no room for compromise. Therefore, we should work hard to strengthen our war capacity with a zeal surpassing that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and implement industrial reorganization to transform the entire country into one large arsenal. I know that our citizens will deeply appreciate this. All our citizens should share the same determination as the government, cooperate to realize the consolidation of enterprises, and work hard to strengthen our war capacity. Therefore, I propose the "Defeat the United Kingdom and the United States: One Hundred Million Strong Resolution," and I dare to request a public decision."</p>

<h3>Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, Elaborates on the Co-Prosperity Sphere's Food Policy; Various Regions Striving for Food Self-Sufficiency, Minimizing Transportation Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, responded to questions from member Togo Minoru at the House of Representatives' Food Production Increase Countermeasures Committee on the afternoon of the 17th, providing a detailed explanation of Japan's current food policy and the food production and exchange situation in Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, the islands, and other southern regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, stating that in terms of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, food is basically sufficient for self-sufficiency. Currently, in order to ensure smooth food exchange between various regions, adjusting transportation is a fundamental issue. This issue is extremely important during this war period. Therefore, Japan and Manchuria both recognize that it is necessary to establish a self-sufficiency policy for major food items. Therefore, when Manchuria established its Second Five-Year Plan last year, it attached great importance to increasing agricultural production and increasing coal production, and made its greatest efforts. Although the harvest of agricultural products last year failed to reach the ideal results, the results of food purchase were better than the previous year. Therefore, soybeans and other items could be supplied to Japan, and a considerable amount of miscellaneous grains could be transported to Korea and North China. The wheat produced in Central China is generally sufficient for self-sufficiency, but because a considerable amount is transported to North China, the rice necessary for Shanghai and other cities currently has to rely on various southern regions. From Japan's perspective, Japan has great expectations for North China in terms of iron, coal, cotton, salt, and other important materials. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate in solving the food problem in North China. In South China, most of the areas within the peace zone are centered on cities, and there are fewer agricultural areas. Therefore, if a considerable amount of rice is not imported from the southern regions, it is impossible to achieve self-sufficiency. In short, although China is actively seeking food self-sufficiency, it has not yet achieved this goal. Due to the planting of cotton and the implementation of other policies in Japan, it is necessary to import food from other regions for supplementation. In addition, the transportation problem must also be considered. The southern region, as a whole, is a rice surplus area, especially Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, which used to export a large amount of rice. Currently, negotiations are underway with Vietnam and Thailand to supply their surplus rice to China, Japan, and other necessary regions. As for the various regions within the Japanese military administration, they are currently striving for food self-sufficiency. In order to alleviate transportation difficulties as much as possible within the possible scope, they are simultaneously striving to increase supplementation in various regions to ensure food self-sufficiency. However, it is difficult for the Malay Peninsula to achieve this goal in the near future. Therefore, it is necessary to import flour from Thailand and other southern regions nearby for adjustment. However, other southern regions such as Borneo are currently also experiencing difficulties in self-sufficiency and need to rely on foreign countries. However, most regions are currently actively engaged in increasing food production, so their future is very promising. Burma has a very abundant food production, but due to transportation reasons, it has not been able to supply as much of its surplus as possible to other food-deficient regions. At the same time, from the perspective of the people's livelihood and future food in Burma, it is not appropriate to reduce the production of rice in Burma. Therefore, within the possible scope, it should continue to produce. In short, although it is possible for China, Japan, Manchuria, and the various southern regions to seek food self-sufficiency, in order to coordinate transportation problems, Japan's current food policy is considering ways to ensure food self-sufficiency within the possible scope in Japan and the regions near Japan, such as Manchuria and other regions, and to reduce imports from afar as much as possible. Therefore, current policies are also based on this policy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in China: One Week of Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army stationed in China announced the battle situation for one week on June 18th as follows: Since the summer campaign began until June 10th, the Chongqing army suffered 30,000 casualties, 4,000 were captured, and the Japanese army seized 87 cannons, 382 heavy machine guns, and approximately 3,000 rifles, achieving significant war results. After achieving their objectives, they immediately implemented counter-offensive operations and destroyed the Chongqing army's operational center. This operation was extremely significant, and the Chongqing side believes it was an operation to invade the interior, causing deep concern. This time, the sudden reversal by the Japanese army and its strong strength have led to vigorous and false propaganda about victory. However, according to a broadcast from the Chongqing side on the 7th: In this operation, the contradictions within the Chongqing army have been deeply felt, which is a fact that is difficult to conceal. According to those returning from Chongqing: The Sichuan army in the interior is quite dissatisfied due to inferior treatment compared to the Central Army, and the entire Sichuan army is filled with ominous signs of instability. Furthermore, a part of the 50th Army of the Chongqing side in Zhejiang Province has also become unstable due to treatment issues. The Chongqing side has always disregarded these regions and used its influence to oppress them. Currently, unstable conditions are occurring successively in various places, posing a significant difficulty for the Chongqing side in terms of command.</p>

A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about his feelings regarding the relationship between China and Japan in promoting international culture as follows: Culture is the foundation for constructing everything. All kinds of progress in modern international relations depend on the promotion of international culture. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our East Asian culture is particularly important. The cultures of China and Japan have a glorious history. However, in the past, the two countries' cultures each had their own emphasis. During the Greater East Asia War, we must not only strive to develop our own national culture, but also further build Greater East Asian culture. The first priority in building Greater East Asian culture is to ensure that the thoughts of young people in both countries are correct. Therefore, during this period, the relationship between young people in China and Japan must be given attention. During my visit to China, I sincerely hope that Chinese youth will cooperate more with Japanese youth to build Greater East Asian culture. At the same time, international culture will also be promoted as a result.</p>

<p>Dongdong, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. today: On the 16th of this month, the Imperial Naval Air Force, with a combined large formation of fighters and bombers, fiercely attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Lunga Point sea area of Guadalcanal Island. As of the 18th, the verified battle results are as follows: Four large transport ships sunk, two medium transport ships sunk, one small transport ship sunk, one large transport ship damaged, one destroyer sunk, and 32 or more aircraft shot down. Twenty of our aircraft have not returned. (Note) This battle is referred to as the Lunga Point sea area air battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Air Force launched a strong attack on the enemy transport convoy in the Lunga Point sea area of Guadalcanal Island on the afternoon of June 16th, achieving extremely significant war results. This is truly the largest war result since the naval battle off the island of Henieier, which Japan became mired in this year. A total of four enemy large transport ships, two medium transport ships, one small transport ship, and one destroyer were sunk, and one large transport ship was damaged. In addition, more than 32 enemy aircraft were shot down. On that day, the Japanese Naval Air Force, after receiving reports of an enemy large transport convoy being discovered, launched a large-scale operation to crush the enemy's attempt to counterattack in one fell swoop. At that time, dozens of enemy fighters responsible for sentinel duty in the sky were already waiting to intercept. It is said that the enemy had already adopted this tactic of waiting for interception when Japanese aircraft attacked Russel Island on the 12th of this month. However, the Japanese Naval Air Force still rushed into the enemy's solid fighter formations with all aircraft. More than 100 aircraft from both sides launched a large dogfight in the air. Japanese aircraft immediately shot down more than 32 enemy aircraft.

Furthermore, one enemy destroyer and two medium transport ships were sunk by Japanese aircraft body crashes. In this battle, twenty Japanese aircraft were unrecovered or self-exploded. This is the first major battle since the South Pacific naval battle on October 26th. Most of the enemy ships sunk this time were transport ships, totaling approximately 53,000 tons, and these ships were all carrying troops and heavy fire resources, so the damage to the enemy was extremely great.</p>

German political figures and journalists have expressed their views, saying that Germany has recognized Turkey's strong determination to maintain neutrality.

<p>Special Issue on North China</p>
<h3>Japan's New Policy Towards China and the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beijing) Following China's participation in the war, Japan has launched a new policy towards China. What is the impact of this in North China? How to materialize it? And how will the autonomous participatory system entrusted to North China under the new policy develop? Based on a comprehensive understanding of the local situation and the views of various parties, a brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Generally speaking, the spirit of Japan's policy towards China has been fully implemented by both Chinese and Japanese authorities and the people in North China. Various specific measures in politics, economy, and culture are being actively promoted by both China and Japan in close cooperation, gradually getting on track.</p>
<p>(2) However, due to Japan's earnest implementation of the new policy towards China, both Chinese and Japanese people initially failed to grasp the true meaning of the new policy. The Chinese side did not deeply reflect on the fact that it was based on the solemn fact of participation in the war and endowed with autonomy. Similarly, the Japanese side also had pessimists who viewed the new policy as a retreat from China. On this point, efforts must be made to thoroughly implement the true meaning of the new policy in the future.</p>
<p>(3) After the implementation of the new policy, the expansion of Chinese autonomy has its limitations, priorities, and urgency in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese side should fully reflect on this. The Japanese side should also take appropriate measures to rationally handle various specific measures. The participatory system in North China will be further strengthened as a result of resolving this issue.</p>
<p>(4) The so-called issue of the special characteristics of North China can only be resolved by focusing on North China's contribution to the war as the highest proposition. The original level of the special characteristics of North China, in expanding and developing into the special period of all of China in the Greater East Asia War, has no reason to continue to exist alone. However, today's situation in China is such that all of China has not yet been united into one, and it has not yet demonstrated the full development of contributing to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the special characteristics of North China cannot but continue to exist.</p>
<p>(5) The entry and settlement of the National Government in North China should also be based on the aforementioned supreme proposition as a prerequisite. If there is an eagerness to centralize North China, it will instead hinder North China's contribution to Japan and greatly appease the people, giving the Chinese Communists an opportunity to take advantage of. Fortunately, the National Government's attitude has been extremely cautious so far, and the rapid centralization work has been quite cautious.</p>
<p>When the reporter came to Beijing, he was questioned by Chinese and Japanese people who asked: "To what extent is Chinese autonomy concretely recognized? What are the limits of the centralization of North China and the special characteristics of North China, which aim to strengthen the National Government?" The key to solving this problem lies entirely in North China's contribution to Japan. Regardless of political or economic issues, in short, all local measures should focus on being able to follow the principle of efficiency in order to adapt to this supreme proposition.</p>
<p>Japan's new policy towards China is by no means to force China to bear heavy burdens. The foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation cannot be the principle of equal sharing centered on the principle of efficiency. The vast capital and outstanding technology required for the development of important resources, transportation, communications, and other projects still depend on Japan's supply, and therefore Japan's leadership cannot but be recognized. Crushing Chongqing and the Chinese Communists is becoming increasingly important in the future.</p>
<p>As for the people's livelihood policy, Chinese autonomy should be made to flourish, and the mission of completing China's participation in the war should be promoted. After the new policy guidelines are fully understood, the North China Expeditionary Army will only have the task of a field army. Apart from operations and security, everything should be let go. A large number of Japanese members of the New People's Society have also withdrawn, and those who remain stand in cooperation with China as advisors. As for the economic aspect, the prices of daily necessities and the sales and distribution are all placed under the unified organization of the Chinese agency, the Material and Price Management Committee, with the Japanese side participating in the plan as a unit of its lower-level organization. All of these represent significant changes due to the new policy. From the Chinese perspective, it represents an expansion of autonomy.</p>
<p>In short, one of the important tasks in the local area in the future is the rational implementation of the principle of Sino-Japanese sharing, and to strengthen positive cooperation between China and Japan on its results.</p>
<p>The special characteristics of North China have a triple nature. On the one hand, North China is the front line of anti-communism, and on the other hand, North China is the center of Sino-Japanese economic relations. China itself, historically and geographically, forms a different area from the south of China. The National Government's participation in the war naturally expands these issues to all of China, but the reality of China cannot be solved by the slogan of participation in the war alone, and there are many difficulties. Not only because of the remaining Chongqing forces, the transformation of these special characteristics into the whole of China is impossible, but also because the National Government's own problems also feel this deeply. In short, the politics of North China have a strong lingering color of the Provisional Government. In economics, the boundaries between the Joint Reserve Certificates and Reserve Certificates shown in the currency are extremely clear. From the perspective of strengthening the National Government to unify the whole of China, although these must be amended sooner or later, the reality is not so simple.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the centralization of North China, a powerful Chinese figure expressed his opinion to the reporter as follows:</p>
<p>The centralization of North China is certainly a good thing, but before that, the people who were in charge of the politics of North China were politicians from North China. Are they to be despised? First, it must be examined whether the North China politicians lack the ability to be in charge of the politics of North China? Secondly, it must be examined who in the National Government can be in charge of the politics of North China. Can that person gain the support of the North China people and implement a better policy than the current one?</p>
<p>This is probably the opinion of the general public in North China. The hoarding problem that has recently arisen in Shanghai has further exacerbated this question. Regarding the handling of important events that test the political power of the National Government, it is hoped that the National Government will give it deep consideration. The Greater East Asia War is now in the autumn of a decisive battle for survival. The base of the military supplies, North China, cannot tolerate any chaos. It is expected that the National Government will strengthen itself and not allow unreasonable political power to infiltrate North China. (Xiang: Translated from the June 7th Seibu Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Economic Reorganization in North China's Participation in the War: Increased Food Production and Price Suppression</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Tianjin on the 8th by special correspondent Nakamura) Due to the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's implementation of a new policy towards China, the North China economy has undergone a historic transformation. Various economic measures, stemming from the demands of the people's livelihood policy and as the basis for cooperation with Japan, are being concretely implemented. Therefore, the mission of North China's economy in participating in the war is extremely important. The adjustment of trade between North China and Central China, as well as issues such as food and prices, are also getting on track. Since the Greater East Asia War, North China has been isolated from the world market, so it has had high expectations for the rice, flour, and other food supplies from Central China. Central China also urgently needs the coal supply from North China, so the relationship of mutual dependence between the two sides is rapidly becoming closer. Therefore, the smooth flow of goods between North China and Central China has become an urgent task. The North China-Central China Trade Promotion Agreement held in Shanghai earlier was based on this demand and outlined the direction of the period.</p>
<p>The important policies decided at the meeting were to exchange North China's coal for Central China's flour. In the future, when North China and Central China trade, the exchange rate of 18 yuan for Joint Reserve Certificates and Reserve Certificates will be maintained, while the exchange rates for special yuan and Shanghai exchange will remain the same.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that when adjusting goods between North China and Central China, Central China goes through the National Commercial Control Association, while North China goes through the North China Trade Organization Association. However, the National Commercial Control Association not only adjusts goods shipped from Central China to North China, but also unifies the acquisition and supply of goods in Central China. It will also set up branches in Tianjin and Guangzhou to break down the regional economies of Central China, North China, and South China as its basic policy. However, from the perspective of North China's intentions, at least for the time being, it will stop at setting up a control association in North China. The relationship between North China and Central China is naturally a trend that parallels the political approach, but its implementation will of course be gradual, because in the establishment of the decisive war system in North China itself, there are still many tasks that need to be resolved, namely the food problem and the price problem. If the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, the development and increased production of North China's resources will be impossible. North China is now overcoming the difficult problems that have accumulated step by step, and is developing a decisive war system, but suppressing prices and ensuring food self-sufficiency are the basis for strengthening production in North China in the future.</p>
<p>The North China Political Affairs Committee has previously established the North China Price Processing Committee and the Food Administration Bureau, and under its supervision, established the Food Quick Transport Company in each province and special city, in order to ensure the input of previous food supplies, increase local production, and establish a procurement mechanism.</p>
<p>As for the issue of rising prices, it has recently become even more prominent. Whether in stabilizing the people's livelihood or reorganizing the economy for war participation, it is hoped that a plan for stabilization will be drafted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The recent causes of rising prices are the hoarding by the consumer class and the prevalence of barter trade due to the difficulty in obtaining food supplies. The Food Administration Bureau and the North China Material and Price Processing Committee have established a Material Balance Fund Operation Committee to handle material and material countermeasures in a unified manner. Furthermore, they are closely coordinating with the North China Central Material Price Cooperation Association and the price cooperation associations in China to move towards establishing a wartime price policy. The situation encountered in North China after the implementation of the new policy is extremely difficult and serious in terms of the price problem alone. To break through this difficult situation, fully exert the political power of the North China Political Affairs Committee, and implement the various economic measures following the change policy one by one, is currently the most important task in North China, and is the mission of North China.

<h3>Public Concession Baojia: Deadline for Re-checking Household Registration, Detailed Report and Guarantee Required; Head of Household Responsible for Changes</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia authorities, in order to investigate citizen certificates and any cases of falsely reported population, have recently ordered the Baojia chiefs of each district to handle the following three matters: (1) Each Jia chief must conduct a detailed investigation within their jurisdiction. If there are any cases of citizens who have not obtained citizen certificates or have falsely reported population, they must immediately submit a detailed report. This work must be completed within ten days, and a guarantee must be provided. Accordingly, the Jia chiefs of each district will submit a pre-printed guarantee form to the head of each household to fill out, sign, and stamp, in order to demonstrate their seriousness. The content of the guarantee states: "There are no cases of falsely reported population in this household, nor do we have any residents who have not obtained citizen certificates. We guarantee that no such incidents will occur in the future. Otherwise, the head of this household will bear full responsibility and will not shirk." (2) Citizens who move to other districts or other cities must surrender their citizen certificates. However, those on short-term travel are allowed to take their citizen certificates with them. If there are any citizens who move without surrendering their citizen certificates, the head of the household must submit a detailed report. If any incidents occur due to delays, the head of the household will bear full responsibility. (3) For citizens who move into this district from other cities and whose good citizen certificates or other proof documents have been lost, the head of the household and the Jia chief shall provide proof, confirming that they are indeed good citizens. If any incidents occur, the head of the household and the Jia chief will bear joint responsibility.</p>
<h3>### Spokesman for Japanese Army Releases Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spokesman for the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai released a statement, saying that Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the Japanese Diet on the 16th of this month was of great significance, and that the Chongqing side has been greatly agitated recently. Furthermore, the military spokesman for the Chongqing side issued a statement on the 17th, showing that they were clearly affected by Prime Minister Tojo's speech. In his speech, Prime Minister Tojo stated that Japan's launch of the Greater East Asia War was to eliminate the century-long Anglo-American aggression against East Asia, and to liberate East Asia from Anglo-American oppression. Japan will spare no effort to promote the task of Greater East Asia, and those who cooperate with Japan include China, Burma, and the Philippines. Prime Minister Tojo specifically pointed out that the opportunity for Burma and the Philippines to achieve independence will soon mature, which has attracted much attention from all parties, especially the Chongqing side, which was greatly agitated. Recently, General Pang Bingxun, a person of great importance and prestige in Chongqing, has come to join the peace movement under the leadership of Chairman Wang, which is an obvious fact. The Chongqing military spokesman issued a statement, claiming that they were being threatened, and mentioned that the return of Generals Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and Rong Ziheng was not voluntary. Now that the facts are clear, General Pang personally took the opportunity to go to Beijing to visit the Chairman and meet with various ministries, and gave a speech. Therefore, the Chongqing side's fabrications and slander are not worth discussing. Regarding the recent Roosevelt-Churchill conference, although we have not obtained the details, at least two proposals could not be decided: some advocated for operations in Europe, while others advocated for operations in the Pacific, and the debate was endless. Mutual exploitation made it impossible to talk about unity and connection. However, Chongqing is being sacrificed, and the Anglo-Americans are simply using its base, which is of no benefit to Chongqing itself. Even the recent proposal in the US Congress to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act, which has been superficially agreed to, is only a temporary phenomenon. The US has no genuine sincerity towards Chongqing. In fact, even if there is such an attitude, it is only for wartime exploitation. This is a deceptive tactic by the US towards Chongqing. The Chongqing side is being exploited and fooled on this recent Allied Nations Day, and is unaware of it, and even proudly displays 32 national flags, believing it to be an honor. This mob does not even know that there are powerful countries outside of these 32 nations. It is feared that before long, a white flag will be added to the 32 flags. By then, this boastful act will be unimaginable. Furthermore, after Stilwell, the US official in charge in Chongqing, returned to Chongqing, he met with Western journalists and expressed concern about the war situation in Chongqing, and stated that the US was making considerable preparations for Chongqing, and how to strengthen it, and stated that the US's 14th Air Force in Chongqing was actively cooperating with the Chongqing ground forces in combat, in order to emphasize and promote future combat. However, this can already be seen in Dongting Lake and Yichang, which can already demonstrate the extent of US-Chongqing combat cooperation. The result is not only ineffective, but has also suffered惨 defeat. To briefly summarize, from May 1st to June 6th, Chongqing-US aircraft were dispatched a total of 127 times, with 222 aircraft departing for bombing missions. During this period, the results of the battle were 17 Japanese aircraft shot down, and 22 aircraft destroyed or damaged. This statistical figure does not include reports that have not yet been compiled. However, in this battle, the Chongqing-US air force is vastly different from the Japanese air force. The US cannot compete with the Japanese air force, because the Japanese air force's excellent qualifications are due to good preparation and long-term training, and the repeated destruction of the US-Chongqing air force is enough to demonstrate the superiority of the Japanese air force. Furthermore, it is said that although it cannot be determined that the cooperation between the US-Chongqing air forces cannot be linked, the Chongqing army is unwilling to have the US air force take the glory of the battle, and is unwilling to carry out the missions of the US commander. Therefore, since the US-Chongqing air forces do not have sufficient sincerity to cooperate, how can there be any effect?</p>
<h3>Chief Hirota Releases Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Information Chief Hirota, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, released a statement:</p>
<p>Developing Resources</p>
<p>Chief Hirota first mentioned the purpose of Prime Minister Tojo's speech, regarding the issue of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere organization and the close organization that is fundamental to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, explaining that a bill has been passed in this Diet to organize Japan's domestic industries and collect and develop resources in the South Seas and China, in order to strengthen war capabilities. The purpose of the discussions in this Diet is to organize Greater East Asia's politics and economy in order to address fundamental issues of how they can be organized. Special emphasis is placed on China to support China's economic and political strength, and Japan is preparing to adjust the various treaties concluded between China and Japan, in order to strengthen the cooperative relationship between China and Japan. In addition, the Philippines was also explained, and it will be granted independence within this year. Regarding the Burma issue, it was said that an independence preparation committee was first established on May 8 of this year, and once preparations are complete, it can be self-governed. At the same time, regarding the Dutch East Indies issue, the people of Java will obtain political participation,</p>
<p>Region or Organization</p>
<p>Therefore, the pure significance of Tojo's speech and the policies being implemented lie in the issue of large-region national organization, in other words, the organization of large-region groups and the organization of large-region national groups. Chief of Information Hirota continued: Why does Japan advocate for large-region national organization? The reason is that from the perspective of the current international situation, in terms of wartime preparation for military force and food, small countries will find it difficult to exist. For example, when the First World War ended in 1919, Great Italy had already declared bankruptcy. Austria has a narrow area and a population of eight million, most of whom live in the capital city of Vienna, with no production capacity. Even if they rely on agriculture to live, they cannot be economically independent.</p>
<p>Ancient and Modern Military Affairs</p>
<p>Furthermore, from a military perspective, due to the rapid changes in modern weapons and strategies, the strength of large countries and small countries is vastly different. Today, the development of material and industrialization, and the development of combat strategies, have reached their greatest scale. Airplanes travel at 700 kilometers per hour. Once combat begins, small countries will suffer the poison of large countries. In 1939, during the German-Polish war, Poland was resolved within a week after the start of combat. From this perspective, we can understand that it is most important to have sufficient food and industrial resources in a large area for economic and military matters.</p>
<p>Strengthening War Capabilities</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of the reorganization of domestic industries in Japan, Japan has the responsibility to protect the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and must strengthen war capabilities in order to enrich the power of protective operations. Among them, petroleum is abundant in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the development of the continuing rights must be accelerated. Today, the land and naval forces, and light and heavy industries, are the main forces for protecting Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>In summary, the organization of a large-region group of countries is an urgent task to adapt to the current international situation. The countries of East Asia must unite and undertake the mission of protecting East Asia, and devote all their efforts to developing the economy and reviving the culture. It is hoped that China will deeply recognize this important significance.</p>
<h3>Embezzling Over Two Million in Funds</h3>
<p>Xu Shengyu, from Jianren, was doing business in Putian and jointly invested with his nephew, You Shoutin, to open Yuhua Shenzhuang at No. 2 Ji'an Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, with Xu investing seven-tenths of the capital and You serving as the manager of Yuhua. In the morning, Xu remitted one million and two hundred thousand yuan from Putian to Shanghai, and You purchased goods. Later, You used the excuse of disrupted transportation and inability to transport the goods and secretly sold and embezzled the funds. Recently, the matter came to Shanghai for unsuccessful negotiations, and a lawyer was commissioned to report the matter to the French Concession Police, who detained You. Over ten thousand yuan worth of goods were recovered. Yesterday, he was interrogated. The plaintiff requested a civil lawsuit to recover damages or return the goods. The sentence is scheduled for the 22nd. In addition, Liu Hanqing, from Fujian, remitted over one million yuan to Shanghai last year, entrusting Yuhua Shenzhuang to purchase wool and cotton yarn. You Shouting, the manager of Yuhua Zhuang, embezzled the goods. Recently, Liu came to Shanghai to negotiate without success, and Liu hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>10,000 Bags of Flour, Emergency Relief Association Temporarily Postpones Purchase Because the Flour Has Already Been Purchased by Merchants</h3>
<p>The North China Emergency Relief Association had previously decided to purchase 10,000 bags of No. 4 flour first and transport it to the north as soon as possible, and had sent a letter to Tongrun Qianzhuang for a loan of 1.6 million yuan to be used for purchasing flour. It is now learned that this move has encountered a change of plans, because this flour has already been purchased by merchants, and the association is now looking for other ways.</p>
<p>The Hebei Native Place Association in Shanghai's radio fundraising results: a total of 194,286 yuan and some cents were collected within seven days, with 652,686.86 yuan outstanding. Li Tianzhen, president of the World Red Swastika Society and standing director of the association, broadcasted Peking opera on the French radio station on the 16th of this month, with excellent results. Donations reached 70,000 yuan on that day, which was quite unexpected. In addition, the China Film Company plans to screen a few days’ worth of movie tickets at a designated theater, and the full amount of the ticket sales will be allocated for emergency relief.</p>
<p>Zhejiang's First District Advances 200,000</p>
<p>Shen Erqiao, Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, initiated emergency relief for the North China disaster, and the Special Commissioner's Office advanced 50,000 yuan from the treasury, Wankang Company advanced 100,000 yuan, and Ningbo Cooperative advanced 50,000 yuan, for a total of 200,000 yuan in national currency. It was first remitted to the Hangzhou Provincial Government free of charge by the Central Reserve Bank on the morning of the 8th for emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Performing Dance Skills for Charity Auction to Help Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Hong Jiong and Ms. Jiang Hua performed dance skills on the evenings of the 15th and 16th of this month at the Great World. They auctioned off gifts from friends on the spot, raising a total of 19,400 yuan. All the proceeds were used for the North China disaster relief and handed over to the Yarn Industry Bank for collection. The enthusiastic act is highly commendable. The list of titles and amounts of friends who enthusiastically purchased for disaster relief is as follows: Li Yao 300 yuan, Tao Youxiang 600 yuan, Qiao Zhengrong 300 yuan, Lu Runsheng 700 yuan, Chen Yongtang Zhou Weibin, Mr. W.S., Huang Jiarui, 300 yuan each, Ms. Han Jianming 3,600 yuan, Sun Ziqian 700 yuan, Xu Jinlou 200 yuan, anonymous 2,900 yuan, Zhang Zhongyuan 200 yuan, Zhou Jinghe, Zhang Liangzhi 400 yuan each, Zhang Chengxi 500 yuan, Mrs. Zhang 700 yuan, Wu Rongrong 200 yuan, Mr. Li 1,700 yuan, Zhang Xingsheng 700 yuan, Wang Lijun 300 yuan, Xu Zixiu 400 yuan, Ni Qinsheng 100 yuan, Shi Jifu 500 yuan, Chen Guangyu, Chen Guangyu, Liu Fanglian, 200 yuan each, Mr. Wang 100 yuan, Lu Zichuan 1,000 yuan, Mr. Wang 900 yuan, Lu Zichuan 1,000 yuan, Le Shichuan 300 yuan, little sister 200 yuan, totaling 19,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>District Court Actively Dispersing Inmates</h3>
<p>The total number of inmates detained in the Shanghai District Court Detention Center is close to 1,000, and pre-trial detainees account for half of them. The weather is becoming increasingly hot, which is not only detrimental to hygiene, but also, in recent months, due to the scarcity of food sources, it is difficult to obtain even a grain of rice. If we do not make efforts to alleviate the congestion in the prisons, then diseases and starvation will follow, and the problem is serious and cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is understood that Court President Wu Zongxing, in addition to contacting the relevant parties regarding transferred prisoners and submitting a request to the ministry for approval of relocation and dispersal, requires all pre-trial detainees to have their cases reviewed by the handling prosecutors, strictly implement bail based on the circumstances of the case, and pay attention to expediting case closures, which will benefit both prison administration and criminal policy.</p>
<h3>Su Yizhi Case, Difficult-to-Forget Report Still Awaiting Translation</h3>
<p>In the case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, the Difficult-to-Forget report has been delivered in the past few days. The content generally finds that there is no poison in Su Yizhi's stomach, and there are no injuries on the whole body, but there is a slight swelling on the temple of the face, and blood is flowing from both ears, which must be caused by a ruptured eardrum. Yesterday morning, the case was again interrogated by the Second Criminal Court. The victim's family member, Secretary Shi, and a lawyer, as well as the elder sister of the deceased, Su Fengying, appeared in court, and the defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court. According to lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station, the report on the case from the 工部局 Public Works Department's health department and the forensic examination report were only delivered yesterday afternoon, and the translation work has not yet been completed, so it is still necessary to study which articles to use for prosecution, and a request was made for another extension. The court ordered Liu Wangshi to be held pending rescheduling for interrogation on the morning of the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Hanqing's Eightieth Birthday, Celebration Funds Transferred to Charitable Causes</h3>
<p>The 20th of this month is the 80th birthday of Mr. Gao Hanqing, a pioneer in the cultural field and founder of the Commercial Press. Leaders from all walks of life believe that Mr. Gao's life's work has contributed to the cultural field, and a public celebration has been scheduled for 3:00 PM at the YMCA. Mr. Gao, being modest and self-effacing, first donated 10,000 yuan himself to save the flood victims in North China and Shantou. All cash received from relatives and friends will also be distributed to various charitable organizations for orphans and the elderly. In addition, a portion will be set aside for scholarships to benefit relatives and friends, to bless the poor and benefit the world.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Frugality Movement, Wearing Old Clothes as a Way to Save</h3>
<p>In order to respond to the simplification of clothing and the textile conservation movement in Japan, the Shanghai Japanese residents have decided to fully launch the "Decisive Battle Clothing Life Movement" by the Total Mobilization Patriotic Association. The residents' association has already worn type B national uniforms made of cotton. The embassy and consulate-general have also decided to wear collared shirts and shorts without ties. At the same time, they are advocating wearing old clothes. The Shanghai Office of the Embassy has stipulated that during the summer work period from the 21st of this month to the end of August, all staff members must not wear coats, do not use ties, and only wear collared shirts and shorts, except on the Great Edict Day (the 8th of each month) and when participating in ceremonies, when they must still dress properly.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of Life Elementary School</h3>
<p>Life Elementary School on Gordon Road was founded by the current principal, Ms. Sheng Wenguang, and has been around for ten years. Yesterday, the school held its tenth anniversary celebration. Fang Wen, a twelve-year-old child and graduate of the school, also held a solo exhibition of calligraphy and painting. School board members Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Sheng Pihua, and Lu Dagong all visited and admired the exhibition, and were all amazed, giving the student high praise. Wen will donate some of his works for a charity sale to help with the disaster relief in North China. The school has expanded its facilities significantly over the past ten years, which has cost a lot of money, all of which has been subsidized by the school board and Principal Sheng. The school is also very strict in terms of discipline and education, and it is no accident that it has achieved today's results, which can serve as a model for elementary schools in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Murderer Executed</h3>
<p>Chu Pengshang Gao Qinong and his wife Gao Zhoushi, who lived at No. 23 Yanjia Zhai, Jessfield Road, were invaded on July 21, 1941, and shot dead by gunmen. The police arrested the criminals Yan Akang, Bao Xingfa, Fan Yongshun, and others, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation.

Deputy Consul Fukuma of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy and others also attended. Deputy Consul Baojian delivered a speech, saying, "It is an honor to have you all here today. I hope that you will all express your opinions on art issues as much as possible. Mr. Osawa is a famous Japanese art critic and has a lot of experience in art research. Please feel free to raise any opinions you may have for discussion. Finally, he said that Japan pays great attention to introducing its culture to China at any time, but it is rare for China to introduce its culture to Japan in the same way as Japan. This is something that should be paid attention to in the cultural exchange between China and Japan." Then, Osawa Takeshin reported the content and work of the association in great detail. All the calligraphers and painters expressed their opinions.</p>
<h3>Streetcars Collide Head-On</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 yesterday morning, streetcar No. 70 of the Eighth Route streetcar was turning from Nanjing Road onto the Bund, heading north, when streetcar No. XX of the Second Route was heading south. The two sides failed to avoid each other and collided head-on. The glass windows on streetcar No. 70 of the Eighth Route were damaged, and two passengers were injured.</p>

<h3>Earnestly Hoping That All Sectors Will Maintain Their Consistent Spirit and Sponsor the Fifth Annual Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, The More Donations, the More Young People Will Benefit; The Amount of Funding Needed This Year Will Definitely Be Enormous</h3>
<p>Applications for the Fifth Annual Shen Bao Reader Scholarship will begin on July 1st, and all procedures are being prepared. In recent days, we have received several inquiries from students every day about the application process. During this period when schools are conducting exams, we earnestly hope that all students will pay attention to improving their academic performance. If they are indeed poor and outstanding, they will definitely be able to obtain a scholarship from this newspaper.</p>
<p>Bring Your Credentials to Collect the Application Form in Person</p>
<p>As for the application regulations for this year's scholarship, they will be announced in this newspaper when the deadline arrives. Applying students must bring their credentials in person to the office to collect the application form. No one may collect it on their behalf, and no requests by mail will be accepted. Those who are sick or who have left Shanghai to return to their hometown during the summer vacation must also have a certificate from the school authorities before it can be issued. However, those who fail to arrive in time for the exam at another place will have their application qualifications revoked.</p>
<p>The Need for Scholarships is More Urgent Than Before</p>
<p>The need for scholarships is increasingly urgent, as past practices have shown that each subsequent session has been more important than the previous one. The reason for this is the increasing financial difficulties of the students, and some students would have dropped out of school two or three years ago if they had not received a scholarship. Therefore, if the scholarship can receive permanent and consistent assistance from all sectors of society, the number of talents that will be cultivated is countless. Moreover, this newspaper firmly believes that each yuan of scholarship given to poor and outstanding young people will have a greater effect than the ten yuan or one hundred yuan wasted by纨袴子弟 the sons of wealthy officials. Therefore, the greater the expenditure on scholarships, the deeper the comfort this newspaper receives, and the more obvious the function of social mutual assistance becomes. Our colleagues are willing to work tirelessly to serve the generous donors from all sectors of society, and to speak on behalf of the poor students. The more donations, the wider the benefit, and the greater the cultivation. This is the wish of our colleagues, and the hope of the students.</p>
<p>Do Not Forget the Poor While Celebrating</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Principal Huang of the China Textile Dyeing Industry Supplementary School, stating that it was the birthday of Mr. Wu Zhongyi, the father of school board member Wu Zhongyi. While celebrating, Mr. Wu felt the number of out-of-school youths in Shanghai, and specifically instructed the school to transfer 2,000 yuan in national currency to be donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund to advocate for it. Mr. Wu founded a supplementary school to benefit employees, and his contributions are immeasurable. Now, he has generously donated a large sum of money, with enthusiasm for education, to benefit society. This is worthy of admiration, and it is a testament to the deep insight of those engaged in education.</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The list of titles and amounts of scholarships received yesterday is as follows: Wu Zhongyi 2,000 yuan, Fei Qihe (saving the expenses of the soup cake banquet for the one-month celebration of his daughter Zhaoyun) 1,000 yuan, Xu Leshentang. Zhu Chishen 200 yuan each, Gongji 100 yuan, Senlin (manuscript fee) 20 yuan, Shen Zhong. (manuscript fee) Wang Jiajie. (manuscript fee) 16 yuan each, Lizhi Middle School (lost and found by students during the semester) 7 yuan, totaling 3,579 yuan in reserve notes, with a balance of 453,831.59 yuan.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Future of Small Banks</h3>
<p>Because the Ministry of Finance has decided to reorganize the various small banks, stipulating that they cannot operate unless their capital reaches 3 million yuan, the future of these small banks only has two paths: "increasing capital" and "merging." This measure, from the perspective of the entire financial institution, certainly has a positive impact.</p>
<p>However, we believe that while setting requirements for the capital of banks is very important, the inspection of banking operations is even more crucial and should not be overlooked. Regardless of the scope or capital of a bank, if its business operations are not on the right track, the greater the capital, the greater the harm. The result would be inversely proportional, which is deeply concerning, isn't it?</p>
<p>The government, with great effort, has devised this method to improve finance and benefit the people's livelihood. Banks should understand this intention well and do their best to assist, so as to produce great results. When we think of the current situation of widespread disasters and the people's livelihood in decline, how can we not be vigilant and implement these measures naturally?</p>
<p>There are many ways to self-discipline: In a negative sense, it means refraining from improper business operations. In a positive sense, it means assisting the government in developing production industries to revive the people's livelihood. Recently, there have been reports that silver and money businesses are forming loan syndicates to invest in production industries. Regardless of the investment path, whether it's rural loans or industrial loans, anything that benefits the social and national economic future is worthy of our joy and praise.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that in today's banking industry, only by investing in production industries can the foundation be solid. At the same time, we also believe that only through cooperation between the government and the people, and diligent promotion, can the banking industry have great achievements. In this time of national crisis, the banking industry, which bears the responsibility for regulating finance, should practice self-discipline and self-encouragement, make more contributions, and meet the expectations of the public!</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Committee Passes Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan, Implementing Unified Wheat Purchase</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Committee held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and passed a temporary plan for the unified purchase of wheat. The committee has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval today. However, due to the urgency of the situation, which cannot be delayed, the Flour and Wheat Industry Committee has been instructed to begin implementation immediately according to the newly established plan. Any amendments or changes required by the Executive Yuan will be communicated separately later.</p>
<h3>Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan</h3>
<p>Consists of ten key points, which will be published separately in today's column for reference.</p>
<p>Centralized Management of the Purchase and Sale System</p>
<p>The plan centralizes the wheat buying and selling system, stipulating that wheat dealers in central locations purchase from producing areas and sell to commissioned and trading merchants. Commissioned merchants can sell the purchased wheat to flour mills or to traders in Area A. Traders can sell the purchased wheat to commissioned merchants in Area B, or vice versa. In other words, the wheat raw materials used by flour mills in various regions can be purchased from commissioned merchants in those regions. Commissioned merchants then purchase directly from traders and wheat dealers in central locations.</p>
<p>Locations for Establishing Branch Offices</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has provisionally decided on the locations for establishing branch offices: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Bengbu, totaling nine locations for branch offices. The locations for establishing sub-branch offices are: Hangzhou, Kunshan, Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Danyang, Qishuyan, Benniu, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yizheng, Jiangyan, Xinghua, Dongtai, Nantong, Chuxian, Luzhou, Anqing, and Mingguang, totaling twenty locations.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Restricts Discount and Loan Measures</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank, in order to support the development of industry and commerce, handles bill rediscount business, etc. However, to prevent speculation and hoarding, the following types of bills will not be purchased or rediscounted, nor will they be used as collateral for other loans: (1) Bills arising from long-term speculation in the purchase of real estate, mineral products, houses, machinery, etc.; (2) Bills arising from consumption purposes and not used for current business needs; (3) Bills arising from speculative transactions. At the same time, in accordance with the revised Central Reserve Bank Law, the bank is not allowed to directly engage in various industrial and commercial activities or provide credit loans or overdrafts for businesses with speculative characteristics. As for the real estate acquired by the bank, it is limited to the following: (1) Real estate necessary for business operations; (2) Real estate acquired due to debt repayment.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Firms Plan Centralized Trading</h3>
<p>The 35 Chinese stock firms in this city, after being granted permission to resume business, are earnestly adopting a policy of self-discipline to promote industrial and commercial enterprises and guide idle funds into the regular market. In order to promote centralized trading, they have been actively discussing various strategies in recent days to ensure the active turnover of stocks while preventing speculation and hoarding. It is also understood that the 35 Chinese stock firms, including Xingye and Yongchang, have temporarily organized the "Chinese Stock Firm Friendship Association" to coordinate all business matters in the future. All matters concerning communication with various authorities, payment of registration fees, and handling of settlements will be discussed by the association.</p>
<h3>Municipal Food Supply to be Coordinated by Joint Cooperative</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative, which has been in preparation for a long time, is reportedly ready to commence operations. The directors and supervisors are scheduled to take office today. According to information obtained by reporters from the cooperative, although the supply of rice to residents in the concession area will still be managed by the Municipal Council through the issuance of rice tickets, the transportation and coordination of the supply will be the responsibility of the cooperative, which will begin discussing detailed procurement plans in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated yesterday, with inconsistent ups and downs. Among public utilities, China Electric advanced rapidly, while Zhabei Water and Electricity saw a decline in buying interest and fell slightly. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rose close to a major level. Great China Match adjusted to level off. Kang Yuan Confectionery stood firm just outside a major level. In the cultural industry, China Bookstore outperformed The Commercial Press. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmaceutical Company showed slight meandering, while New Asia Pharmaceutical was weak. The textile industry remained strong due to yarn prices, with Wing On Textile once again exceeding a major level before falling back. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories faced excessive demand. New shares of Sino-Japanese Cotton Mill suffered a small setback. The department store sector saw the greatest fluctuations, with Wing On and Sincere both rising slightly. Chinese Underwear and King Fook Hosiery found buyers at lower prices.</p>
<h3>Activities of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The three associations for soy sauce, soy sauce gardens, and soy sauce dealers have been ordered to merge into the Soy Sauce Industry Association. It is reported that the association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, with over 140 members attending. Representatives from various authorities were also present. After performing the necessary ceremonies, Cai Yuanfu, Fang Zhongfu, Shen Zhongyang, and others were elected as directors, while Song Xielin, Chen Yuting, and others were elected as supervisors.</p>
<p>Tea and Pastry Industry: The Shanghai Tea and Pastry Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Relevant authorities attended to provide guidance. The association's charter was approved on the spot, and the first board of directors and supervisors were elected. As a result, Huang Jingqi, Li Guozhi, Xu Rongsen, and others were elected as directors, while Zhou Weixing, Wu Qingdai, and others were elected as supervisors.</p>
<h3>Temporary Wheat Unified Purchase Plan Established by the National Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>The importance of food policy in a wartime system is self-evident. To ensure military needs and provide adequate food for the people, a sound organization and a comprehensive plan are necessary. Cooperation between officials and merchants, strengthening supply and demand management, can achieve this goal. However, to achieve this, increasing production is the first priority.</p>
<p>Flour is a staple food, and the adequate supply of flour depends on increased wheat production. Central China is a region with abundant wheat production and a concentration of flour mills. Historically, the amount of wheat harvested has not been sufficient to meet the needs of various mills. Due to the lack of precise statistics, it is impossible to determine the ratio of agricultural output to purchase volume. Currently, the Ministry of Food is actively promoting plans to increase agricultural production, such as promoting specific techniques, protecting loans, and improving technology. The increase in agricultural production will certainly be effective. However, significant efforts are still needed regarding large-scale purchases to replenish warehouses. Since the outbreak of the war, the environment has been complex, movement has been difficult, and goods have not been easily concentrated. If prices are further suppressed, farmers will be unable to make a living from their agricultural products, and the raw materials for flour mills will inevitably be affected. In order to improve the results of purchases and maintain the balance of commodity prices, the following ten-point wheat purchase plan is established:</p>
<p>(1) Average allocation for collective production: The amount of wheat allocated to each flour mill will be determined by the association based on the production capacity of each mill. Each mill will designate a commissioned merchant to procure the wheat according to the allocated amount, without exceeding the quota. (2) Establish a centralized management system for purchases: To achieve centralized management, a buying and selling system will be established. (3) Facilitate the collection and concentration of sources: The free movement of wheat from rural towns to the centralized markets will be ensured, allowing wheat to concentrate in the markets. (4) Prevent speculation and hoarding, and prohibit mutual buying and selling between parties of equal status: To supplement the provisions of Article 2 and prevent speculation and hoarding, mutual buying and selling between parties of equal status shall be prohibited. (1) Wheat dealers in the same centralized location shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (2) Commissioned merchants shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (3) Traders shall not engage in mutual buying and selling. (4) Flour mills shall not sell wheat. (5) The association may, within a certain period, purchase all unsold wheat purchased by commissioned merchants, traders, and wheat dealers in centralized locations at an assessed price and allocate it to various flour mills. (5) Complete registration and accurate statistics: Statistics are the preliminary work of control, and registration is an essential procedure. The wheat production area is vast and complex. In order to achieve thorough management, the registration process will begin with wheat that has already entered the market, gradually extending to wheat that has not yet entered the market. Detailed registration is required for all wheat arriving at centralized markets (including quantity, price, storage, movement, and sale to traders or commissioned merchants). The procedures will be handled by wheat dealers in centralized locations. All traders who transport registered wheat to needed areas must register in detail at both the departure and arrival locations (including the name of the buyer, the purchase price, the quantity, and the destination). The procedures will be handled by the traders. All flour mills purchasing wheat must register in detail (including quantity, price, name of the commissioned merchant). The procedures for receipt and storage in outside warehouses are the same. All commissioned merchants who purchase from traders or sell to flour mills must register (including quantity, price, the brand of the trader from whom it was purchased or the name of the flour mill to which it was sold, and the storage location). The association will print the registration forms separately. Those engaged in the wheat business can submit the forms to the association or its branch offices nearby, and the association will compile the reports to create statistics. (6) Establish branch offices widely to strengthen the purchase system: Branch offices will be established widely in major and secondary wheat-producing areas to supervise and manage the various purchase organizations, concentrating and strengthening purchase matters. Provisional locations for establishing branch offices will be determined. (7) Stipulate the qualifications, registration, and business scope of purchase organizations: Flour mills and those with the qualifications to manage wheat businesses in the various locations where the association's branch offices are established, as stipulated in the preceding article, must register with the association or the local branch office in accordance with the following regulations: (A) Flour mills: Those who are members of the manufacturing group of the local flour industry association and have registered with the association may request the association to allocate wheat. The allocation method will be determined by the association, and each mill will purchase according to the allocated amount and comply with the following regulations: (1) Procure according to the quantity allocated by the association, without exceeding the quota. (2) Report the price and quantity of wheat received daily to the association or branch office. (3) Each mill's wheat procurement will be handled by a designated commissioned merchant, but the designated commissioned merchant must be reported to the association for verification. The association may order a change or revocation if necessary. (4) Each mill shall not directly purchase from wheat dealers in centralized locations, traders, or farmers. (B) Commissioned merchants: Those who are members of the local grain industry association and have been designated by a flour mill may purchase from traders and wheat dealers in centralized locations (i.e., locations where the association has established branch offices) according to the quantity designated by the flour mill, and comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the association. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) Be commissioned by a flour mill to purchase wheat from traders or wheat dealers in centralized locations. (4) Report the daily purchase situation and the quantity of wheat delivered to the mill to the association or local branch office. (5) Not directly purchase from farmers. (6) Not engage in mutual buying and selling with other commissioned merchants. (7) The purchased wheat must be completely delivered to the commissioning flour mill and not resold to others. (8) Commissioned merchants shall not also operate a wheat dealership in a centralized location. (C) Traders: Those who have the qualifications of a member of the local grain industry association may be traders. However, they must register with the branch office in the collection area before procuring wheat from wheat dealers in centralized locations and transporting it to needed areas (i.e., areas where flour mills are located), and shall not hoard. They must comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the branch office in the procurement area. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) The wheat transported must be registered wheat from wheat dealers in centralized locations. (4) The transported wheat shall not be sold locally but must be transported to the destination and resold to a flour mill through a commissioned merchant. (5) Report the daily procurement of wheat to the branch office in the procurement area. (6) Not sell unregistered wheat. (7) Not engage in mutual buying and selling with other traders. (8) Not resell to non-industry personnel. (D) Wheat dealers in centralized locations: Those who are members of the local grain industry association and have registered with the local branch office may be wheat dealers in centralized locations and may directly purchase from farmers or wheat dealers in nearby towns who do not need to register with the association and sell to traders and commissioned merchants. They must comply with the following regulations: (1) Register with the branch office. (2) Be a member of the local grain industry association. (3) Directly purchase from farmers or wheat dealers in nearby towns who do not need to register with the association. (4) The purchased wheat may be sold to traders or commissioned merchants but shall not be directly sold to flour mills. (5) Report the daily purchase and sale situation to the branch office. (6) Not resell to non-industry personnel or engage in mutual buying and selling with other wheat dealers in centralized locations. Flour mills, commissioned merchants, traders, and wheat dealers must strictly comply with the provisions of this article. Violations will result in the immediate cancellation of membership and severe punishment. The penalties will be submitted to the government for approval and implementation. (8) Implement adjustment policies and prevent competitive behavior: If a flour mill is unable to meet its approved purchase quota, the association will make effective adjustments to its allocation ratio after investigation and verification of legitimate reasons. If there is a total shortage of purchases, the allocation amount for all flour mills will be reduced proportionally. Flour mills should strictly implement wheat acceptance to eliminate the bad habits of competitive buying and adulteration. (9) Negotiate appropriate and reasonable prices to encourage rural production: To encourage rural production and increase the purchase quantity, the association will consider the costs of water wheat and flour, and reasonable profits, and propose reasonable prices to be submitted to the government for approval. (10) Implement the plan in a timely and appropriate manner: The plan will be drafted by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and submitted to the National Commercial Control Association's Board of Directors for approval and reported to the government for record.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Temporary Hospitals in Various Places During the Epidemic Prevention Period</h3>
<p>As the hot summer approaches, various circles are doing their utmost to promote epidemic prevention work. In addition to hospitals and doctors providing medical consultation and medicine, the Municipal Health Bureau has recently set up temporary epidemic hospitals to benefit the poor and sick. It is planned to set up one in each of two locations in the southwest of Shanghai, one in the second branch of the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road in the west of Shanghai, and one at the old site on Daji Road in the south of Shanghai. It is scheduled to start receiving patients on July 1.</p>
<h3>Quickly Launch a Relief Effort for the Chao-Shan Drought</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zeng</p>
<p>The drought situation in Chao-Shan is dire, and the situation is spreading like wildfire. The Chao-Shan people in Shanghai should organize a relief effort. There is no shortage of wealthy merchants from Chao-Shan, such as the grain gang, flower side, new people and new things mortgage pawns, normally willing to spend a thousand gold, and they cannot stand idly by now. Recently, I heard that a certain PhD border merchant who is welcoming education, and the church are in the process of raising funds. I hope that all enthusiastic benefactors can overcome all difficulties and use the simplest and quickest methods to seek benefits for their hometown.</p>
