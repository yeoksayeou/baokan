<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際時局與東亞</h3>
<p>世界戰爭，即將以何種新的姿態出現，已是每一個關心國際形勢的人士所不能忽視的問題了。戰局的新開展，只是時間問題，而時間又是步步逼近。於是，種種猜測，無根據的興奮和憂慮，多少會傳到東亞人民方面來，正確的解釋，是不容或緩了。</p>
<p>新的戰局沒有展開之前，我們固然無從懸揣其眞實的內容與趨勢；不過，就最近各方面所表現的事實來看，問題的中心，是歐洲的第二戰綫和德　兩元首會議的後果。關於第二戰綫，被反軸心國呼喚着巳有兩年了，雖然迄未成爲事實，但是，現在，中於北非戰局的新形勢，又重新被提出而且似乎要見諸事實了。不過，我們應該注意，所謂第二戰綫的意義；第一，它的成爲事實，首先要看英美的實際戰鬥力，這裏包括海陸空軍的兵力，龐大的運輸力和安全的運輸路綫，優越的空軍和制空權的保持。這幾點，英美是否已有充分的整備？觀於突尼期一隅，英美以極大優勢的兵力，尙遲遲未獲所謂「決定的戰果」，則已可使人得到相當的暗示了。第二，它的實現，決不能完全取決於兵力，而尙須注意到中立國的態度，其中起着決定的作用的是土耳其和西班牙，無論如何英美如果不能首先獲得土西兩國的支持，那麼，今後戰爭的進行，決不能順利。第三，是歐洲各國人民的心理與意向，也是未來戰爭的決定力量之一。英美方面對此有什麽把握呢？所謂大西洋憲章，早已因印度問題而自己暴露其虛僞的面目。對法國問題，英國支持着戴高樂派的民族委員會，而美國則扶植季勞特政權，同時還和維希政府保持外交關係，這種自相矛盾的形態，在歐洲人民的心目中，會喚起同情嗎？假如不能先得歐洲人民的同情，則第二戰綫的前途當然還黯澹一如疇昔。</p>
<p>另一方面，德義的態度，就明朗得多。他們用不着裝腔做勢，也用不着利用一切外交陰謀和新聞宣傳，元首直接的會談，迅速的獲得了結論；隨後，便是行動。我們不僅看不到如敵方所宣傳的任何矛盾，而且相反，就是在歐洲其他小國之間，在德義的領導之下，也團結得和一個國家一樣。這決不是紙上的黑字，而是要從歐洲總力動員的新事實中看到的。我們但看最近蘇聯方面的情報，他們也已承認德義今後動員範圍與力量之龐大，即如地中海方面敵軍總司令艾森霍華在最近對記者報吿北非戰况的談話中，也不能不承認德義軍的攻擊精神之「意外堅强」和「戰鬥力不容低估」。所以，縱使「第二戰綫」終於成爲事實，那實際上也不過是曇花一現的肥皂泡而已！</p>
<p>歐洲，無論是北非，地中海，大西洋和德蘇戰綫，目前都在暴風雨前的沉寂時期，這沉寂是不會太久的，任何一方面的一粒子彈會打破它。但是，誰有勇氣打破這個沉寂，並不是問題的中心，因爲，未來的勝負，並不取決於此，它是需要問：誰在今日準備得更充分，總力動員量澈底。德國宣傳部長自己所說：「大凡敵人的戰力，毋寗加以高估而防備之爲最賢明」，（三月十五日朝日新聞社論引語）而朝日新聞社評（同上）所說，對於英美和蘇聯之間的爭執，也不如低估其在未來戰局中的影響爲宜，似乎也不失爲忠誠於盟邦的諍言。不過，從我們東亞民族的立塲來看，在未來的暴風雨之前，我們必須堅守住自己的崗位，盡一切力量以澈底消減英美帝國主義。新的世界一定要降臨，咸洲和東亞是不能分割的。</p>

<h3>畑總司令返京　談視察華北感想</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍報道部二十日發表；畑總司令官自四月十二日以來，視察華北各地情形已於十七日返京。</p>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍畑總司令，二十日下午三時三十分於司令官官邸會見記者，發表談話如下：日前曾歷經華北各地視察，如太原，石門，保定，北京等華北方面各部隊，歷見各方面將兵一致，十氣　爲盛旺，爲完遂大束亞戰爭，不分晝夜，從事於作戰之警備與訓練，各立於本身之崗位上，努力工作。尤其關於此次日本對華之方針，前綫將兵，均深切了解其趣旨，刻正逐漸付諸實行中。又由於　興之中國，爲吾人强力之後援，使吾人得專心於作戰之　備及訓練工作，本總司令對此，至深欣慰。藉此次視察之機會，得與華北政務委員會朱委員長及其他各要人舉行懇談。又鹽澤公使曾就現地之狀况，向本人報吿，始　華北方面中國人士，積極刷新其內政，日僑亦拋棄個人之利害，深切體念日本國策之眞意，從事於中日共同合作之偉大工作，本人對於當　中日官民之如此協　，頗致謝意。渝方現巳喪失蠢動之餘力，中共對於日本對華方針之進展，如交還租界，移讓敵產，收縮分散兵力等現象，猶舉行種種反宣傳。在現行戰爭下，世界各國，發生共同之現象，即民生之食糧問題，共匪亦曾企圖利用食糧問題，籠絡和平地區之民衆，驅之於抗戰陣營之下。但去年來共匪所謂「今年打倒德國，明年打倒日本」之一種無根據而不兌現之虛偽宣傳，失敗以後，彼等已達智窮力竭之地步。日並在二十七屆議會開會式之勅語中，會表明對華方策，始終不渝，蓋非確立中亞之和平，不足以復興中華，故彼等之虛爲宣傳，實毫無一顧之價値，故無論中國人或日本人，無論官吏或民衆，應互相信賴，互相協力，自肅自戒，凡足以惡化中日兩民族感情之言語，或行動，應予愼重，並應拼棄兩民族前途之一切阻碍，不予彼等以反傳，再相信鞏固大東亞民族之總力，足以打倒英美，並完成大東亞之建設，本人茲將視察中心得之感想披瀝如上，同時繼續執行日軍作戰警備之任務，徹底覆滅一切之敵性蠢動，並重行表明關於復興中國大業，決予以極大之援助。</p>
<h3>共軍團部　政治委員郝光投誠　透露中國共軍眞相</h3>
<p>石家莊二十日中央社電　國民政府參加大東亞戰爭後，影響於渝共兩軍者至巨，彼等旣目覩國府之發展，及中日之眞誠合作，又深知抗戰之非計，故紛紛設法來歸，參加和運，擁護同生共死之國策。共匪第六軍區第一團政洽委員郝光，爲冀南共軍中年齡最輕之團級幹部，渠早即深知抗戰非計，唯有和平始可救國，久存來歸之心，故於二月二十三日奉密令潛入冀省無極縣工作時，乃乘機向日軍警備隊投誠，願以反共戰士資格，擁護國府。據渠談中共曾根據抗戰工作指令，於去年九月主張政治攻勢。乃密派共產分子潛入和平地區，中國武裝機關進行策動，謀使其崩潰。至於本年實行謀略宣傳，以爲對民衆工作大事宣傳。大東亞戰爭發生後，日軍戰區擴大，故華北日軍，不得不開往南太平洋作戰），方又命其部下避免與日軍作戰，着重攻擊保安隊與縣警備隊，俾向民衆誇示威力。至於政治委員，均爲入黨六年以上之老黨員，係遴選黨員中，對共產主義具有莫大之信念，而富於鬥爭精神者擔任。各團中之政治委員，均須絕對服從中共最高機關之指令，如與團長意見相左時，則由政治委員作最後之決定，故可謂共軍完全操諸政治委員之手。</p>
<p>石家莊二十日中央社電　隸屬河北省共軍第六戰區中央團之前政治委員郝光（譯音），最近奉中國共軍之命，潛入河北，而被日守軍所俘。渠詳述共軍利用之種種方法頗詳，現經兩個月之軟禁後，巳贊同國民政府之和平運動，渠自承對於一九三四年朱德所部之共軍移往陝西北部一事，出力頗多，蓋自去歲九月以還，共軍一再企圖偷運共產份子往和平區，藉以搗亂該區內之軍隊，在可能範圍內，竭力避免與日軍發生衝突，此爲其一貫政策，並不斷襲擊當地警團與保安隊，藉在民衆面前，表現其强大力量。渠末謂，共軍之政治委員皆從先進共產會員中挑選，而聽命於共軍總司令部。</p>
<h3>周特使　訪問朱委員長</h3>
<p>北京二十日中央社電　國府訪滿特使周佛海，廿日上午十時赴華北政委會委員長公館訪問朱委員長，舉行懇談。</p>

<p>濟南二十日中央社電　日軍部隊十七日以來，即對魯西地區之共匪五百人，加以討伐，燬滅共匪於冠縣東方，是役共匪陣亡　五一名，被虜八九人。</p>
<h3>浙傳省長赴禾</h3>
<p>杭州二十日中央社電　浙省長傳式說，以太湖東南第二期淸鄕工作，瞬將結束，一切亟待處理，特於十九赴禾，所有省政委由政務廳長孫雲章代。</p>

<h3>日谷萩少將闡述　去歲美機襲日經過</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩今日發表談話，大意謂：美國官方曾計劃在最近發表美機於去歲四月十八日空襲東京之詳情。此項消息傳出後，一時頗引起美國民之期待。但因美陸軍當局之反對，故美宣傳當局僅作簡單發表，謂去年四月十八日空襲東京之美機係由航空母艦起飛云云。至此吾人已可應美國國民之期待，而代美當局發表美機來襲東京之詳情。（一）「美機空襲計劃之大要」由陸軍飛機北美「一三二五」式中型轟炸機十六架，組成臨時編隊，由美陸軍部空　上校杜里特任指揮，首搭乘航空母艦，迨迫近日本時，起飛轟炸東京·橫濱·名古屋·大阪·神戶各地後，飛往浙省衢州渝飛機塲集合，再飛往重慶，加入渝方美空軍義勇隊。以上乃其空襲計劃則分兩項：（甲）乃以大襲爲目的；即於四月十九日旁晚前第一批首由航空母艦起飛，在日落前抵日本，向橫濱方面工廠投下燃燒彈。第二批則繼第一批在日沒後抵日本後，依照第一批機投彈後起火之各處爲目標，以及東京附近各地所定之目標投彈轟炸完畢後，各自認定方向，在翌日拂曉飛歸渝方機塲。（乙）乃在甲案未能實行時，則選取適當時間實施白晝轟炸。將臨時編隊飛機十六架再分爲五小隊，第一至第四小隊共計飛機十三架，由杜里特上校指揮，轟炸東京附近。又第五隊則由裴爾加少校領隊，轟炸名古屋大阪神戶。（二）「徵求空軍人員參加轟炸日本之情形」去年三月以前，美即開始向轟炸隊及偵察隊分別徵求人員，其徵求時所用名目，例如「有無希望從事秘密而冒險之重要任務」「有無希望轟炸某地之人員」「有無希望在外國服務」等等，結果應徵者共計一百二十人。經杜里特及斐爾加與的克中尉等三人考査後，最後決定採取八十名。彼等應徵之動機，大多數均抱有向國內出風頭之意，同時亦充滿冒險性，且認爲可在短期間內進級增薪。（三）「出發前之訓練及防諜情形」此項錄取之八十名，於去年三月一日各自分別由所屬各隊搭機赴佛羅里達州埃格林機塲集台，繼在該地由杜里特訓練三星期，遂於三月二十七日搭機飛抵舊金山對岸之薩克拉門飛機塲，於四月一日始開拔。其間當局曾極愼密防諜，絕不顯露將有轟炸日本之企圖。即八十人中亦均不知彼等將空襲日本，僅知將被調往非洲及南美。又彼等受訓之地點，係在美本部海岸，該方面幾無一東亞人。又受訓時且嚴禁外出，自三月二十日起耶禁向外界通信。在三月二十日前彼等寄家信件　　中，大致均謂將調往其他部隊，或謂將赴外旅行的歷兩月，其間不能相見，以及離美後暫時或或難通信等等。（四）「開拔後之情形」彼等於四月一日搭趁航空母艦黃蜂號由舊金山出發，翌日社里特向衆表明目的乃在轟炸日本。於是彼等頓時大驚，其中有多數人即認生還無望而精神緊張，並有要求不參加者。然繼又以爲日人均具高尙道德，對俘虜待遇素極優良，故又計劃萬一機件被擊中，則於跳傘遇見日人時高舉雙手。生命當不致危險。至此彼等乃又表示樂觀，遂在艦內繼續受調，並按地圖熟記進入日本國內之方向，退路，及遭遇攻擊機時之逃避方法，及選定目標方法等。繼於四月十日分別閱讀「被俘後須知」一書。彼等在艦內之待遇及給養之惡劣，　出彼等意外，同時彼等之不滿空氣亦趨惡化，然此種空氣終爲彼等空襲日本之好奇心及冒險趣味等物質與心理兩方面所抑制。「實施空襲」彼等最初乃按甲案預定在四月十九日夜空襲日本，然在十八日上午八時，因種種關係改取乙案。其航空母艦於是日上午八時半距日本七百里時，第一批機由杜里特帶領相繼由艦起飛，最後一架離艦之時間爲九時二十分，各機分別向目的地前進。空襲東京時適爲正午，各機飛抵東京橫濱上空，分別投下炸彈三四枚及燃燒彈一箱計一百二十枚後，即向海洋方面逃逸。又空襲名古屋方面之一隊，初以犬岬爲目標，向西進發。然經伊豆半溝時，遭日戰鬥機追擊，遂避入雲間飛抵目的地後，其飛行高度的爲五百英尺，乃投下所帶炸彈及燃燒彈。又企圖轟炸大阪方面之敵機，因中途恐遭日戰鬥機攔擊，遂變目標在名古屋投下所帶之炸彈及燃燒彈，俾减輕其載重量，而向洋面飛逸，其間美機數架被日機擊落，並予其他數機相當損害。美機見勢不佳，隊形即亂，乃分經九州南方之種島附近，向浙省衢州方面飛去，其大部分似分向犬岬及陸地跳傘，杜里特及其他數人則幸免一死，又機件受損起火者殆已死亡。以上襲日美機不懂未完全達到目的，且殆被盡殲。是役杜里特等並未飛至日本上空，僅使部下向日本轟炸，而自身則經日本南部海面於高空飛逃浙省。另有美機一架則降落蘇聯境內。</p>

<h3>協約軍重整部隊　突境攻勢轉呈鬆馳　軸心軍擅長山地戰守防綫　美國空軍名將維森作戰陣亡</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　今日突尼西亞之陸地戰事繼續沉寂。英美兩軍因由馬萊斯綫北攻時頗有損失，現正從事於整頓軍隊，及補充軍火。但雙方空軍，則從事偵察與互轟頗爲活躍。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派昌稱：突尼西亞西部戰綫之北段，於星期五尙在貝迦及梅傑茲埃爾巴勃地區有猛烈戰鬥，至週末則漸　沉寂。安德森將軍巳不得不鬆弛其對德軍奮勇防衛之高地陣地之攻擊，此實由於英軍在星期四及星期五曾受嚴重之損失。倫敦每日快報之軍事評論員，於星期六承認傑貝爾安格山峯經猛烈之戰鬥後，已復入德軍手中，極爲優越之英第一軍無從施展，巳被迫再度延緩其在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃突破軸心陣綫而至突尼斯之冀圖，因不能將德軍之山戰部隊，驅離其高地上之側翼陣地。此次延緩在德軍可算爲勝利，雖則敵人必然利用現時之停頓，以準備再向德方山嶺陣地，作更猛烈之攻擊。在突尼西亞橋頭堡之南部戰綫，僅在恩斐達維爾軸心陣地之前方，曾與英軍之斥堠隊發生衝突。蒙特高筏萊將軍似巳完成其砲隊之集中及其他準備，故主要攻擊不久或將開始。渠擁有坦克車三師步兵四五師外，爲非洲境內反軸心軍之軍中之最强大者，此外反軸心總指揮部，另有美軍一二師亦受其指揮，故非洲方面之敵軍以該處兵力爲最强。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首行營十九日補充發表戰况如次：目前突尼西亞戰綫所以呈小康狀態者，乃由於反軸心軍蒙重大損害後努力整編軍隊之結果，尤其美軍各部隊因過去數日間之戰事損害甚鉅，致不得不自前綫撤退。反軸心軍亦承認損害甚大，並謂軸心軍之山嶽戰術訓練精良極爲巧妙，反軸心軍所蒙損害中以戰車之損害最大，自四月一日至十五日反軸心軍喪失戰車二百輛，由此可見戰車於突尼西亞戰綫，實較其他各戰綫允佔主要地位。同時證明於山嶽地帶以戰車作集團攻擊殆不可能。且反軸心軍戰車之供給，須經遙遠之路程始運往前綫，故其損害更爲嚴重。又最近英空軍於歐洲亦蒙莫大損害。英方承認數月來德方防空力大爲增强，戰鬭機及高射砲均甚充實，四月十五日十六日兩日反軸心空軍於德本土及西歐占領地喪失飛機百十九架云。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　此間本日獲悉：美國報紙捧爲美國飛行名家之空軍隊長維森，已在突尼西亞境內空戰時被擊落殞命。</p>
<h3>德慶祝元首誕辰　戈林發表文告　勗勉軍民共矢忠誠　協助元首完成偉業</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首今日度其開戰後第四屆誕辰，德國人民將不舉行盛大慶祝典禮。德人今冬在東綫大戰中所感覺戰事之殘酷，對於元首誕辰表面慶祝形式之決定，亦與有力焉。本屆誕辰之充滿政治與軍事色彩，可於戈林發表之吿國民書·德軍總司令所頒布之軍令·及官傳部長戈培爾之演說中見之。德元首將在總部度其誕辰，是否舉行任何特別招待會，現尙未悉。今年春季降臨較平時爲早，大約元首今日誕辰之特徵，將爲從事於特殊重大之嚴重工作。元首誕辰之唯一外面表示，將爲全國懸旗慶祝。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　今日爲德元首希特勒之五十四歲誕辰，戈林元帥特向全國發表文吿，略謂：今日德意志舉國上下皆以熱烈之心忱，慶祝元首誕辰。在此嚴重戰爭時期，祈禱上蒼默佑元首及其所擔負之重大工作。願來年元首政躬保持康泰，因德國之命運，全繫於元首之手中也。上冬數月中，又可表示元首小屈不撓之力量。過激黨人集中大軍，余圖突破德軍陣線，開闢直入德國之門戶，然元首之精神及意志力，激發德國英勇戰士之士氣，冉度由充滿犧牲之防守，轉爲奮勇與勝利之進攻。歷史中對於世人之輕易成功，往往不甚重視，必須其人具有勇敢之精神，經歷最危急之時期而卒底於成者，始能永垂史册。吾元首在此偉大之戰爭中，正實踐其解放祖國及挽救西方文化之工作。數十年來　首爲人民及國家服務，至爲艱辛，尤以從事奮鬭之數載中爲更甚，而元首不願稍息仔肩，其樸實之軍人姿態，及對於責任之認眞，並隨時準備作任何之犧牲，此種精神皆爲吾人最好之榜樣。吾人現正竭力追隨其步武，尤以今日爲更然，因勝敗存亡，在此一舉。吾人現已達到最嚴格磨練之時期矣。菩德意志之人民乎！吾人今日及將來，皆應向元首表示不可動搖之忠誠，及助其完成大業之決心。</p>
<p>戈培爾演詞　柏林十九日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊：德元首誕辰之前夕，柏林音樂會堂舉行麽祝典禮，黨國軍政代表·以及傷兵·軍火工人·與其德國男女代表均到會參加。宣傳部長戈培爾博士宜稱，「德國人民今日以特殊嚴重之心境，慶祝元首之壽辰，戰事現巳達於最艱難之地步，戰事之結束與出路，目今尙遙遠無期，凡參加戰事之人均知彼等並非爲改正疆界而戰，實爲生命與生存而戰。在一九三九年九月之前，敵人原可履行德國之要求，而無害於彼等之權力名譽與威信。但彼等鑒於德國之日趨强盛，一如邱吉兩在一九三六年所官稱者，故不惜造成此次之大戰。英國國家之生存繫於均勢，而今則均勢漸失，其所以戰爭之目標尤一無所得。鑒於敵人之宣傳企圖使人遺忘此次戰爭之原因，故吾人必須追溯此次戰爭之開端，方能明白其發展之經過　目前劇性之頂點。按戰前元首再三企圖限制軍備，避免戰爭，甚至於戰爭旣發生後，仍企圖使其　日結束。但此積努力終歸無效，蓋因敵人　意戰爭，不惜全力以促成之也。敵人僅　享受個人之財富輿無限制之勢力，而　於其人民之痛苦則漠不關心，因此　戰爭貿易者不明其本國人民之眞正利益也。彼等痛恨國社主義之人民運動，痛恨國社主黨之德國與德人，尤其痛恨德元首。彼等認爲元首在國事進行之範圍內，侵害他人之利益，彼等對於戰爭早巳從事準備，然後在彼等所認爲適當之時促其爆發，此即今决戰爭之原因與目的。在敵人陣營中，若干政治家足爲德人所仇恨之世界之典型。同時在德人方面，德國人民所愛與保護之世界由一人代表之。有人嘗　德元首　德國人民之典型，其實確如此。任重耐勞與意志堅決之特點，以及深切關懷人民與人類之受苦，可於元首之面部察見之　元首個性所　出之力量日見增强，其效力決非敵人之蜚語宣傳所能克服。任過去二次可怖之冬季中，證明德元首與德國人民決心糾正一九一八年秋季之歷史的錯誤，而爭取最後之偉大勝利。德國人民今日在元首五秩晋四壽辰之前夕，向元首個人及其歷史性之工作致其祝福之意，足爲忠心與信仰之表示。在此次戰爭　最佳之道德的武器，厥爲德國前綫與後方九千萬人民對一人之忠順與無條件之服從」。郭氏末稱，「吾人相信德國必能勝利，因吾人信仰元首之故。吾人將始終忠於元首追隨其後。元首爲吾人之信心與希望。一國人民擁有如此一位元首而無條件追隨其後，必大有所爲」云。慶祝典禮之最後節目　　，爲貝多芬第九交　曲之演奏。</p>
<h3>英美宣傳謀略的實相　美國的宣傳謀略　用電波誇張戰後經營</h3>
<p>（阿根廷京城十二日古田特派員發）　美國對內對外宣傳的大本營，不消說是戰時情報局。這戰時情報局在去年六月大改組結果，包含着四個情報關係的機關，即：資料統計局（局長馬克利休），政府公報局（局長美萊特），緊急國防調整局內的情報部，情報調整局內的海外情報部。現在據紐約時報的發表，這個誇爲「世界上最爲强力而有統制」的宣傳機關之戰時情報局，其所担當的工作，是統制和管理大總統直屬之下所有政府機關的宣傳情報，所以其權限是很大的。成爲其首領而表示着美國人一派之精力的工作姿態的，便是挨雨馬　大衛斯。大衛斯本來是（美國新聞社）的華盛頓支局長，當時曾大顯其辣腕，後來成爲無移電新聞的報告員，馳名於全美，隨着去年六月情報局的改組，爲羅斯福所羅致。這個大衛斯所賴爲左右手的，有兩個人，第一就是情報局總務部長，即北非反軸心軍司令官艾森霍華的阿弟，米爾頓。艾森霍華，另外一個便是佔着海外部長的重要地位的羅巴特。沙烏德。沙烏　雖以劇作家出名，然而更使他出名的，乃是他是羅斯福演說稿的起草者中最有力的一個。</p>
<p>軍部和情報局的口角</p>
<p>情報局的首腦，除上述外，另有兩個在美國對內對外的宣傳上，担當着不可缺少的重要任務的人。這兩個人一個坐在華盛頓的陸軍部裏，一個坐在海軍部裏，都是專門担當草擬公報的人。在海軍部裏的，是退役海軍少校DR希爾，陸軍部裏的是退役上校FV腓資蓋拉爾德。這兩個人都有着會經參加過前次大戰的經歷，而且都是以新聞記者爲其本業，在政府各部的情報官中，他們要算是最有敏活的手腕者，這兩個人，常各和其上司陸軍參謀總長馬沙爾，海軍作戰部長金格，直接協議，而各發揮其拿手傑作。如前所述，本來這個工作，當然受戰時情報局之統制管理的，然而美國的「戰况公報」，因着政治上的利用，於是就時常要發生摩擦和糾紛。最近美國的雜誌「生活」，以「跳舞的戰况公報」爲題，揭發其閒的事情，把美國戰况公報的混亂無秩序，自行暴露無遺。現在把其全文介紹於下：</p>
<p>「美國國民，自開戰以來，關於戰爭的眞實情報，究全被蒙蔽着。在華盛頓，軍部和戰時情報局之間，關於戰爭的眞相，連日由糊塗的拙劣的鄕下舞者操縱着。即美國陸海軍最高統帥所在的白宮，有什麽舉動時，戰時情報關係當局，迄於其最下部機關，都要步法錯亂，在舞狂跳。對於這種狀况，誰都會發生『美國國民難道不　不認識戰爭的重大性爲慮嗎？』的疑問。更其不行的，乃是國民自初即抱着『不管眞偽，陸海軍當局凡於美國不好的情報，無不加以隱蔽』的印象。』戰時情報局新長官挨馬爾。大衛斯的出現，原可緩和國民的這種憤懣的，然而國民的期待，竟完全被出賣了，那就是雖以大衛斯來充任，關於陸海軍的戰况，還是不能發揮其『創造力』之故。其所帶來的事情，却是大衛斯和軍部情報官的口角。</p>
<p>播音是宣傳主力</p>
<p>担當着戰時情報局之中樞的工作的，實在就是海外部。情報局員三千人之中，半數的一千四百人，爲海外部所佔，其工作的大部分，乃是無綫電　音。羅斯福自一九三三年執政以來，其從實施新政以迄加入大戰，爲要實現其食得無厭的野心而排斥許多强力的正論，其所恃最大的武器，便是所謂爐邊談話等之無綫電播音的最巧妙的活用。美國於對內對外宣傳上，致力最多的，實在就是利用電波的戰鬥。現在由海外部向海外播音的次數，一星期達二千六百八十八次，使用的語言建二十國，網內播音機關有二十一處，海外的麽播機開有三十三處。這樣的陣容，正可以把上述事實明白證明了，這海外播音之中，現在最注力的是北非，同時向土耳其，瑞士。瑞典方面的播音，也傾注着相當的力。至於其宣傳方針，則並無一定的軌道，乃是規着聽者而顚倒是非指白爲黑的。例如早餐前的播音，就是一套自騙之人之談；對於瑞典方面，常是舉出軍備上之天文學的數字，說出一大批道理，徹底賣弄其詭辯；對於非洲方面，則完全是信口雌黃。</p>
<p>對外謀略的實體</p>
<p>以上所說，不過是利用無綫電播音的宣傳而巳，此外還有以白宮爲大本營，即直接根據羅斯福的指令而行的對外謀略，實楚最可怕的。這謀略基於（一）削弱敵國的戰意，（二）引誘中立國，（三）激發本國人民的戰實之三個原則。循着這些原則，現在美國所最注力的，便是所謂戰後經營問題。即把戰後的國境，民族，經濟等問題，大事誇張，插入音樂，從播音合播送出去，以戰後利益引誘中立國，振作本國人民鬥志等，作爲其綱領。這綱領決不是從外部想像出來的，最近的美國報紙紐約太陽報，自己大胆地用着：美國把這些謀略撒播於全世界，作爲其效果的溫床而最被期待着的，便是第一次大戰以來浸潤於世界的美國主義，是對於以高度的消費生活爲基調之美國式的生活的憧憬。我們於此不能不認爲美國今後更將改換其手法，改換其方式，由一切的謀略拚着命盡其所有的力，要使這溫床，開出「敗北主義的化」來。</p>
<p>中立國方面的譏笑</p>
<p>然而最近瑞典的某有力報紙，對於這種一連串的戰　經營問題及與此相關作爲　　反擊手段而撒播　的英美蘇對立之誇大宣傳等的謀略性，指摘着說：</p>
<p>「這些，結局不外是要掩董英美戰　目的唯一招牌　民主」之舊套陳腐性而傳播着的宣傅，他們的意圖，對於反軸心國，固不必說，還想把中立國也引入自己的陣營裏。我們中立國對於這種民主臭氣四溢的代用品，決不曾被其騙倒的」。</p>
<p>總之，最後的問題，乃是戰爭目的和戰爭目的間之格鬥，軸心方面之基於天地正義的戰爭目的、巳爲國民所淸楚理解而把握着，這位「一代煽動政治家」羅斯福的思想謀略，是不會奏功的吧。（丁譯自四月十四日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>巴黎十九日中央社電　據法國當局本日發表之數字，至本年四月六日爲止，英美對法國城市轟炸之死傷人數，計一八。七八九人，其中死者六·三四九人，傷者一二·四四〇人，無家可歸者計二十萬人以上，此數係包括自危險地區撤退者。自法國與德國簽訂停戰協定後對法之襲擊與年俱增。一九四〇年法國被炸六次，一九四一年三十六次，本年開始三個月增加至三十一次。實際上法國海岸地區之森州及伊得夫龍斯地區之各城鎮皆已遭受猛炸。</p>
<h3>庫彭河口戰事熾烈　德軍掌握主動地位　新銳部隊渡寇許海峽增援</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　據東錢消　庫彭河上地區德軍，現已完全掌握戰局之主動性。十九日晨乃於全綫開始猛攻，前後三次衝殺蘇軍防禦綫，予以極大損害，最後終於突破一處。蘇軍認庫彭河口地區乃德軍夏季攻勢之唯一根據地，故對戰局前途極表憂慮。德方現正經由寇許半島增加新銳兵力包圍蘇軍。蘇軍企圖產制德軍，似已於諾伏洛西斯克南方開始反攻。據德軍前綫消息稱，蘇軍巳蒙致命損害，狼狽敗退。又德空軍於東綫全域極活躍，與客歲德軍展開夏季攻勢前之情勢極相似。</p>

<p>瑞士京城二十日中央社電　今日倫敦官方宜布：大西洋中曾發生潛艇與飛機之激烈戰事，共歷時四日之久。據稱有重要護航隊二起，駛近英倫三島時，忽被强大之德潛艇隊所發見，遂在英空軍保護所不及之區域中開始攻擊。英方承認損失重大，因德方所放之魚雷均中的也。後護航隊駛入英國海岸指揮部飛機之航程內，英·加·澳·紐西蘭·及比利時之飛機遂紛紛起飛，攻擊德方潛艇。四日之內連續進攻十九次之多。結果德潛艇是否有損壞或沉失，倫敦官方至今未能斷言。據路透社訊，海岸指揮部曾向參加攻擊之機隊發出信號，謂自飛機出戰之時起，德潛艇之攻擊巳大見减輕，故巳救出大批船隻出險，殆可無疑。</p>
<h3>土耳其在巴西　設置大使館</h3>
<p>安加拉二十日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社今日消息：土耳其國務會議議決，設大使館於巴西，另於南非洲與加拿大各設公使館。按土國在巴西以往祇有代辦一名。</p>
<h3>好萊塢動員明星　擔任軍火廠工作</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十九日中央社電　據好萊塢報吿：美政府因人力銳减，巳決定動員好萊塢男女明星，使在軍火廠工作。第一步將有二萬明星及電影從業員，被派至洛克希特維格飛機廠工作每日四小時。</p>
<h3>「大西洋圍牆」巡禮</h3>
<p>（柏林笠特派員四日發）三月二十七日夜十時，我們在空襲警報大作聲中，乘車自柏林出發，於翌日午後，到達荷蘭海岸　近。昨夜襲擊柏林的英機，在雜林中，就可見到他們燒燬後的殘體。記者現由德軍總司令部嚮導，代表日本駐德的新聞記者，與其他五六國的記者代表，一同視察德軍在荷蘭的對英防禦設備。</p>
<p>杜佛海峽中的護航隊</p>
<p>靜閒的北海之春的波濤，昨夜的空中戰，雖在遼遠的彼方，但此地却一逕是沉默的戰塲。等待敵人的防壘，二　，三重……無數重地構築完成了。荷蘭特有的自水面高聳的堤防上，築有堅固的混凝土防　，在混凝土壁之　，鐵絲網的障碍物，密密層層地張着，在背後，到處安置了戰軍防禦砲，這就是所謂近代的「萬里長城。」</p>
<p>防壁後面的旅館和住宅，靜悄悄地不見人影，不再是一年之前那樣豪華的景　了，現在全部己經變成了要塞。無數的地雷，這眞，那裏，似蜂窠般密佈着。</p>
<p>佇立在防壘上，眺望杜佛海峽　浩渺的海面，烟雲淇濛中，有三艘商船出現在我們的望遠鏡中，似是出人於羅台爾達姆的護送船團，後面跟着一艘德國軍艦。我們視察了從南到北的各處海岸，第一綫防壘的構造，大體相同。大槪荷蘭的全部海岸綫，都是一樣的罷</p>
<p>爭戰與和平的交映</p>
<p>高射砲和營房，完全偃臥於偽裝色靑草中。自山陵以至於田　，甚至於道路中，雜亂縱　地密佈着障礙物。牛馬悠閒地　憇着，碧綠的蔬菜，自田地　鑽出來。在玻璃花棚中，在早春的花圃中，水仙花與蕃紅花爭研鬥艷，黃　相映，象徵着戰爭與和平的交錯。</p>
<p>在一般海岸防禦距離不遠的地方，我們進人了防禦陣的最重　地點，龐大的要塞。高射砲陣，相當的巨砲，砲口都向着杜　海峽那面。在這地方，縱橫地掘就了比我們的身長還要深的塹壞。高射砲，大砲相近的地下，築有混凝土製的營房。</p>
<p>給我們解釋的將　說：　　裝置，在實質上　已完成了。完全築　的陣地中，敷設着革地，其間有整齊的步道，似置身於公園。高射砲　用錄色偽裝起來，在各處隱藏着。中央觀測台上瞭望的兵士，用「　　」這種特別漸定器窺覘天空，而四面的　射砲也以同樣角度　　觀測台如手足般自動的活動，　中於敵機射擊。</p>
<p>樸訥的砲兵司令官</p>
<p>在同一焦點地帶，我們又見到了第三的防禦陣地。巨砲像廟宇中大佛那樣龐大，巨大的砲身，一半埋於水泥鋼骨的基礎中。這些巨砲抬頭皆是，無論何種艦隊，休想走近這海岸綫。</p>
<p>樸訥的砲台司令官，抱有與城共存亡的決心，守備　砲台。他允許我們參觀砲台的內部，　對任何質問，不加答覆，雖然如此，我們還是釘住他作如次的問答：</p>
<p>問：「最上部的裝甲有多少厚？」</p>
<p>答：「那不能說。」</p>
<p>問：「很厚嗎？」</p>
<p>答：「很厚，大約可以忍受彈炸的轟炸。」</p>
<p>砲合的四周，尙有　骨　案物及許多機械。</p>
<p>問：「這大砲曾經發射過嗎？」</p>
<p>答：「射過的，是我親自射的，當然是練習啦！可是這大砲隨時在　瞬間即可以發射的。」</p>
<p>日本海軍的發明</p>
<p>離開砲台，　參觀彈　庫。這是近代的岩屋。因爲墻璧非常厚，所以屋子很小。這在外行人看來，無論幾公斤重的炸彈，無法洞穿。旋開機紐，看到屋中那小孩那樣高的砲彈，堆如山積，準備十分周到。那司令官一面用手撫摸那砲彈的頭，一面却突然看見我是日本人，於是打破沉默說：</p>
<p>「這信管的構造是日本海軍的發明·日本海海戰中的初次試騐，獲得大勝，因而大量製造。自此以後，技術更見進步，英美已造成了幾相彷彿的東西。以前砲彈當與緊硬的鐵板斜交而過時，常不能滑溜地發出。」</p>
<p>我們移步至密　於重要陣地的高射砲陣地進人其中央司令塔。隊長正在解釋觀測與指揮　時候，屋子內突然空氣緊張起來，「警　　」「那是敵機！」「不上觀測台　視嗎！」立刻登高而望，在六千公尺高度之上　英機還是美機，渡海而來。而　　國　　　高射砲的烟霧中。</p>
<p>從觀測機中看時，有雙引擎轟炸機五架，其　隨着戰鬥機　架，逃出高射砲彈　包圍，向羅台爾　姆那方面飛去。記者現在不能具髒的用數字列舉荷蘭海岸綫上德國防禦陣地的詳情。</p>
<p>第二戰綫不可能</p>
<p>照我們現在所見的看來，第一，除利用地形之外，再加上了嚴固的混凝土防壁。而且敷設着地雷，高射砲，大砲的陣地密佈，置有機動砲兵。第二，在本格的要塞地帶，有擊滅掩護上陸部隊的艦隊，並後方運輸船的準備，敵人在上陸之前，即加以擊破。第三，戰車壕。那戰車壕的構造，很爲巧妙，即使海岸防壁的一部被敵戰車突破而畏驅直人，也很易於阻止。加以鐵絲網，利用地形的運河，以及無數埋於海岸中的玻璃　藝溫室，這些對於戰車　進行都極不利。那麽，假使敵人不打　方海岸而來，選擇荷蘭特有的濃霧的日子，突然使用　落傘部隊，從後面援護前方的上陸部隊，這塲合又將如何呢？後方各小地區，均配有大小各種部隊，以防萬一。</p>
<p>德軍將士之堅決的意志，假使敵人企　冒險進犯，固將遭遇堅强的抵抗，但在人的決意以外到底，必須有充分的物的設備。德國就是這樣在物質的與精神的一方面都巳有了充分準備的國家。</p>
<p>參觀了各種防禦設施以後，有很多的感想。其一，這龐大的工作，大概都在一年至一年半的短時間造成的，這不只是値得驚異的問題，而是在一年的時間中可以完成　樣一種防禦設備的問題。例如一年前見過法國海岸防禦狀態的人，斷不能推定一年以後的防禦進步到這地步。</p>
<p>其二，爲打破英美第二戰綫的希望，德國的防備，完全控制，並且抑止便於後方運輸的立脚點，及備有上陸條件的地點。</p>
<p>我們感到英美要在北海並大西洋岸開　第二戰綫幾是不可能的。（翔：譯自四月七日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>印緬邊境　日軍英勇戰果　突破馬酉山脈天險　予英軍以殲滅打擊</h3>
<p>仰元二十日中央社電　自此次日軍在日溪北方包圍殲滅英印軍後，敵方奪回日溪之企圖業已失敗，而滇緬路綫之再開亦已成泡影。此不僅予敵陣營以深刻打擊，且日軍因此决作戰之成功，其在西南最前綫之地勢亦益形有利，此影響於今後戰局之推移亦甚鉅，故頗堪重視，首就戰略而觀，此决作戰則實堪稱爲典型之殲滅戰，如加拉當河畔阿堡庫滑及康左克附近之戰鬥，如馬酉河東岸基滋歐之戰鬥，如馬酉山脈西側孟加拉岸即印典附近之戰鬥等，均爲速續而澈底之包圍殲滅戰，此亦即爲此次作戰之一大特徵，尤其在印典附近之殲戰中，爲第一次　擊敵第六旅團，結果予以　滅打擊。繼又擊滅自南北進之敵第四十七旅團，更於印典北方七公里與自南方北上之另一日軍部隊相協力，而將殘敵圍殲殆盡。另一日軍部隊復印馬酉山脈中部北進，於明將特河（在塞基瓦北方八十八公里，注入孟加拉灣）南岸，三次展開包圍殲滅戰。當時該部隊僅以一中隊之兵力，突擊二千敵軍，結果斃敵五百，餘亦完全潰敗。以上三次包圍殲滅戰，日軍雖裝備稍差，兵力又薄，但尙能於海岸地帶敵軍艦射程距離之內屢獲戰功。再就戰鬥之眞相而言，則已如前次報吿，敵方當時有絕對優勢之砲火，並與飛機相聯繫，如頓貝庫正面一地，敵即配置大砲卅八門。英魏貝爾曾自豪謂頓貝庫爲軍之練兵塲，其發砲最多時，僅向一處即不惜浪費砲彈至四千枚，且復以轟炸機連日向日軍挑戰。敵軍並具有完備之交通，暨充分之糧食，及優秀之裝備等，又據守天險以抗日軍。然日軍對此仍克服彈藥糧食補給之困難，實行渡河作戰，征服密林蔽空之天險，以少數步隊勇敢作戰。日軍精銳於迅速征服地形上之困難後，常出敵不意如通過馬酉山脈時，自山脈東側之伊瓦基特至山脈西側，並未使用敵方原有之駝馬道路，全由人跡未經之峻險高地，偷襲至敵軍背後展開神出鬼沒之夜襲戰，而使此次殲滅作戰因此大獲成功，此實可大書特書者。又在此次作戰中，阿拉坎人於第一綫之槍林彈雨中，仍積極協力日軍運輸糧食彈藥傷兵等，實允堪注目。此外尙有一事足述者，即英軍　與日軍拼力作戰，然仍到處暴露英軍統帥之紊亂，及指揮官判斷力之薄弱等缺點。試舉一例即爲英軍首腦部，初認日軍絕不能突破馬西山脈之天險，此爲英軍敗並之最大原因。又因日軍突破馬西山脈佔領印與　滅英第六旅團後，英第四十七旅團之退路亦被截斷，待該旅團長溫巴萊得悉日軍巳佔印典，爲時已　　　。其部下乃陷於慌亂狀態，即於向北敗退途中被日軍殲滅。溫巴萊本人現尙徬徨於印典南方馬酉山脈中，若不爲日軍所俘，勢將餓死，或竟供野獸之饞慾，亦未可知。總之，英美爲圖挽回頹勢，及與所羅門方面之對日反攻相呼應，欲在西方打開進路。但至今日，巳可證實其企圖決無實現可能。此於反軸心陣營之打擊，自極重大。此次英軍之攻擊阿拉坎結果，反引起日軍之進擊，且因日軍已佔領各重要據點，乃使日軍在印緬國境方面之戰略地勢益形有利。在今後該方面之戰局中，日軍乃亦獲得完全之主動地位。</p>
<p>英軍失敗原因</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　泰晤士報所載英軍在印緬邊境戰敗之原因有二：（一）爲補給困難，蓋阿拉坎地帶叢林密集，湖沼縱橫，且缺橋樑，故運輸極爲困難，而日軍則因已控制馬酉河口，易自日溪向頓貝庫拉强克源源補給。（二）爲英印軍因不能控制孟加拉灣之制海權，目船舶不足，故欲攻佔日溪，必須奪取安達變羣島，確保孟加拉灣之制海權。英軍目下正疲於北非作戰，故不能撥出充分船舶在該方面應用。</p>
<p>日軍戰術優越</p>
<p>四月八日泰晤士報載：日軍因在高處築有堅固塹壕陣地，且又奮力防禦，堪稱「第二之浦那戰」。且日軍偽裝隱蔽極爲巧妙，致使英軍平時誤算日軍主力，如當　英軍偵察　曾報吿，謂日軍巳退出馬酉半島，但日軍之側面包抄，常出英軍意外。英軍爲排除側而威脅，乃不得不屢屢後退。至機械化兵器之使用，在該方面全不適當，故迄未使用坦克車。（戰敗之影響）</p>
<h3>日商議通過　戰時增强航運</h3>

<h3>殘殺波軍官案　蘇波關係惡化</h3>

<h3>季勞致特戈爾　備忘錄內容</h3>
<p>瑞士京城二十日中央社電　今日英京消息：季勞四月一日致特戈爾備忘錄，巳於昨日在倫敦公布，俾可更正外間牽强附會之風傳。季氏於備忘錄內，提議在法蘭西未解放以前之時期中，先設立一參議會，行使法國之主權。該會將　速迂回法國境內，一俟全境解放之日，該會即將政權交還代表大會所成立之臨時政府。此項機關將代表法國進行和平討論，並决定國會選舉之日期。</p>

<h3>評言　再論金融業併運動</h3>
<p>關於合併各小銀行與銀行自肅體制，近曾反覆申論，誠以銀行界果能嚴正自肅，則銀仃的業務，自能漸上軌道，而不至誤入歧途；爲謀進一步的合作，則銀行的合併運動，目爲銀行發展過程中第二步必有的現象。不論當局是否確在考慮合併辦法，然爲銀仃業本身設想，與其將來爲政府强制施行，何如由同業早爲之計。</p>
<p>原來，銀行業欲循正軌的發展，負荷當前及將來經濟的重任，實非集中銀行的力量不爲功。現在上海新設的銀行，有如雨後春笋，其中實力的强弱，頗多參差，各行的背景，亦多不同，現　散漫，無庸諱言，長此以後，實多危險。環顧我國經濟金融的情形，並考察先進國家銀行發展的趨勢，自覺我國的銀行事業，仍不能適合現代自然的潮流；各業銀行中雖不免有立塲互異之處，然頗多性質相似，董監相同者，何不加以合併？况銀行之合併，在日本行之甚力，即在我國，亦不乏其先例。所以，我們於批評之餘，期望銀行界信孚望重的熱心人士，登高一呼，設計一種妥善合併的辦法，以供政府當局之採擇施行，實爲金融重業前途之幸。</p>
<h3>厲行「自肅體制」　銀錢業積極收回放款</h3>
<p>本埠金融界方面爲制止囤積居奇，決厲行金融界之「自肅　制」。此項「自肅體制」之第一步，即爲由各銀行自動收回最近十日來之放款，同時銀錢業公會亦決定凡屬公會會員，此後絕對不許再經營不正當之放款。</p>
<p>茲悉最初收回放款之銀行爲（一）中央儲備銀行上海分行，（二）中國銀行，（三）交通銀行，（四）金城等四人銀行，共收回之對象爲（一）短期信用放款與（二）物品抵押放款。至其他各大小銀行及錢莊亦巳開始緊縮籌碼。據悉銀錢兩業會員行莊在最近一週內收回之放款巳達一萬萬元其他非會員行莊收回之放款，亦達五千萬元之多。又悉銀行公會與錢業公會兩團體爲協助當局制止圃積，巳決定下列辦法：</p>
<p>（一）除各同業公會會員商店外，其他個人或團體之以商品向銀錢行莊作扺押放款者，一概予以拒絕。</p>
<p>（二）凡屬銀錢美公會會員行莊，一概不准兼營商業。</p>
<p>（三）物品抵押放款之金額，須經當局許可再由銀錢業公會之核准，並須詳細記明公司名稱及代表人姓名金額，放　期間及担保商品之數量。</p>
<p>（四）凡屬銀錢兩業公會之會員行莊，有違反公會規定之仃爲，公會當局決將其開除會員資格，並再呈請當局予以懲處。</p>
<h3>春繭收成延遲</h3>
<p>頃絲業方面消息，本年度春繭收成日期，因天氣較往年寒冷，故將展延四五日，約於本月二十日上　作繭，月底本可收成者，現需延至五月中。</p>
<p>商統會擬進行蒐買</p>
<p>現因物資移動新制實施後，對於絲繭之運輸可不受限制，故本市絲業界積極進行蠶絲收買工作，而其中規模較大者爲本市金融界與絲業界組織之中國絲業公司及華中絲業統制會。據悉商統會方面爲謀蒐買工作統一起見，將　劃收買絲繭之各項方法。</p>
<p>收成可達十萬担餘</p>
<p>又悉本年度春繭之收成，因絲價高增農民育蠶者增加，故其數量亦可望予以增加。春繭之蠶種在華中地區共計三百萬張，其中三十九萬爲日本種，浙東地區計日本蠶種三萬張，中國蠶種六百張，太湖區域日本蠶種共達三十六萬張，預計兩處可收春繭約十萬担餘。</p>

<h3>讀者論壇　倡議整頓新開銀行之義務</h3>
<p>— 莊頣年</p>
<p>年來本埠一地，新開銀行之畸形繁榮，自表面觀之，似爲本埠工商企業之勃興，故亟需大量資余融通機關爲之供應調節，參考諸實際，則新開銀行之中，固有一部份維持正常的銀行業務者，但意圖漁利，謀發「銀行財」者，亦復比比皆是，且因其業務之悖理反常，巳有若干銀行涉於週轉呆滯或虧損浩繁的地步，決非一般人所能想像。</p>
<p>筆者因職務關係，於核查若干新開銀行之營業情形及財務狀况，發覺此輩銀行之賬面記錄不盡不實之處尤多，溯其原因，無非意圖隱瞞業務狀况之眞相，或朦蔽一般股東與關係人之察覺。例如：聞有某行者，其董事長及總經理，均係掛名，從未到行一日；其開業時實收資本，僅有一百十數萬元，而開辦費支出計有行址頂費四十四萬元，生財裝修文具印刷等支出五十五萬元之鉅，收支相抵所餘無幾；其主要業務則爲本身從事團貨，及買賣證券。又有某行者，其內部辦事人員之多，幾與活存項下之客戶人數相等，營業清淡，終日嬉戲，傳聞該行開幕時，凡認若干股份者，均得介紹一人進行，故管理者雖欲裁撤一人亦不可得；其唯一業務則爲由信託部借名客戶買賣或囤藏各貨，上至雙馬藍鳳，下至八卦丹，電燈泡，罐頭食品，無一不有。又有某行者，其分行遍設各地，其業務乃爲鉅額囤置棉毛織品，此項棉毛織品價裕低落時，則爲行方損失，價格昂漲時，則爲行中人員利益。且一旦金融劇變，勢必重現曩年之信託風潮，相率傾覆。政府當局亟宜予以澈底的糾正，並當於穩妥條件之下，及早予以合併，庶幾社會人民，均蒙其利。</p>
<h3>參劃商統會人士的見解</h3>
<p>煙草</p>
<p>捲烟部門籌備主任永野郁四郞氏爲華中葉烟草株式會社社長，該社之前身爲華中捲烟組合，爲三年以來担任極困難之華中捲烟收買配給之統制者。</p>
<p>華中葉烟草株式會社組織完備，運營健全，足當統制機構之仟。關於烟葉，因外國烟葉之輸入告絕，故唯一辦法，祗有努力增產。至增產計劃，華中葉烟草會社業已擬就增產五年計劃，自卅一年度開始，向預定之增進預算邁進。第一年度之成績頗佳，約爲卅年度之一倍。</p>
<p>烟葉之輸入，原由美國佛及尼亞輸入者頗多，故從不計及烟葉之生產。茲因大東亞戰爭而吿杜絕，乃注力於鳳陽美國烟葉之增產，以爲抵補，而獲異常良好之成績。鳳陽烟葉爲美種，故品質頗佳，不遜於純佛及尼亞產。烟葉向在各地收買集合，茲加以改良，而樹立改良計劃。自去年起，以美國種無償分配農民播種，獎勵栽培，聯乾等乾燥方法，亦擬漸行使之普及。烟葉之改良，由會社派遣中日指導員至各地，今年並在門台子農塲養成指導員，募集率生二十名加以培植。</p>
<p>華中之烟葉消費量，略感不足，第一次五年計劃完成後，華中部分足可自給，繼第一决計劃之後，預定繼續進行第二次五年計劃。第二次五年計劍完成，則華中固不成問題，並可以供給日本。統制總會之下層機構烟草部門，無論其組繼形態如何，確信此計劃實有絕對必要。烟葉種子，前由日本供給，自去年起，設農塲三處，建立採種之計劃，今年起漸可採取。用此種子以改良土葉，華中可供種烟葉之地，將漸以此種子配給。鳳陽美國烟葉漸見改良，原來烟葉，亦希加以改良，而能豐富供給良質之烟葉。以前因有佛及尼亞烟葉之輸入，隱然佔得獨佔地位，今後不應再有此現象，而應大量增產並不較遜之烟葉。因此，不僅在栽培方面，即農民向所採用之第一次乾燥法亦不能不加以改良。栽培上，乾燥上都須加以相當注意。同時，若不能予以補助，則難有預期之進少。故在目前情勢，種種因難問題因之而起。唯增產爲絕對的要求，無論如何，不能不首先完成。</p>
<p>華中現已採取各種必要指置，在中日協力下，有力機構業已建立，當前急務，應首先確立華中烟葉原料之基礎，並須加以硏究。而機構方面，無論上層，末端，不能不由中日人會同組合。</p>
<p>華中烟棄草株式會社自戰亂中艱辛成長，其成果即中國人亦均蒙其利。故今後因中日合辦，而可成爲有力機構，書爲運營。</p>

<h3>我</h3>
<p>— 獄徒</p>
<p>很奇怪，人們記得最牢的是「我」，忘得最快也是「我」。</p>
<p>當一件事情認爲成功之後，大家最希望是能把「我」抬出來，更希望有人搖旗吶喊，說明這成功完全是靠了「我」的功勞，雖然這成功眞正是由於「合作」或是出於偶然和出乎意料。</p>
<p>假如事情失敗了呢？最先躱藏，或是逃避責任的是「我」，或者是登報聲明「與我無涉」的是「我」，最壞的是誰？當然不是「我」！</p>
<p>我受到痛苦時，似乎普天下應該一掬同情之淚！非「我」受到痛苦時，一笑而巳。</p>
<p>但是「我」到底是什麼呢？是一粒魚肝油精！對嗎？是「大我」中的精華（？）是天之驕子！偉大哉！「我」！</p>
<h3>爭辯</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>在同事羣裏，我時常看見有幾個往往爲了一件極端微小的事情，而大家堅持着自己的成見，面紅耳赤的『爭辯』起來，堅持不下。</p>
<p>他們都眞有着驚人的自信力，雖然，他們有時也或許會理解到自己的錯誤，但是；却因爲他們太信任了自已，或者，以爲『認錯』是一件大失面子的事情，所以，寗願「爭辯』得聲嘶力竭，決不肯『認錯』了事。</p>
<p>我也曾經數度以和事老的姿態，周旋在他們的中間，但是，在追根究底之下，方才知道起因是那般微小，甚至，對於他們的本身是絕對沒有甚麼重大的關係，像：『爭辯』着某一個女性的漂亮和不漂亮的問題，天上會不會落下米來？……等等，我從不曾聽見過他們『爭辯』着學理上的見解，或者托爾斯泰是那一國的人？天演論是誰著作的？空氣是有色的還是無色的？……</p>
<p>我眞欽佩他們有着這空閒的時間，和這般多餘的精神，爲着這一些無謂的問題，而作着這般無謂的消耗。</p>
<p>不過，他們『爭辯』的重心，還不是完全側重於那起因問顯的中心，他們的所了這般面紅耳赤，聲嘶力竭『爭辯』的焦點，還是基於各個的自信力－－誰都太信任了自已。</p>
<p>人，是應該有堅韌的自信力的，不過，假使他太信任了自己，而不去判別一種事情曲直的究竟，而一味堅持着自已的成見去武斷，這就小是純凈的自信，是一種近乎蠻橫的自專。</p>
<p>這類的人實在太多了。</p>
<p>『爭辯』也決不是絕對的不應該的。我記得，在求學的時代，學校裏還時常開着辯論會，讓我們大家根據着自己的見解來『爭辯』着，這種『爭辯』，倒或許着實會給我們不少學識上的助益。但是，那些不必要的無謂的『爭辯』，我認爲大可絕滅的。</p>
<h3>車中速寫　原性</h3>
<p>— 楊賽</p>
<p>雷車在開的時候，有二個人還盪在車門外面。</p>
<p>『裏面的人讓地讓呀！我們要跌下去啦！』二個人齊聲喊，裏面的都是安全的，他們巳不怕再跌下去，他們都逍遙自在的談笑着。</p>
<p>『我們要跌下去啦！要跌下去啦！』</p>
<p>結果當他們眞的跌下去之後，裏面的人才讓開一些些的地方，並目同聲說：</p>
<p>『這兩個人眞不當心，有地方不上來，現在闖了禍，不能怪別人吶！』</p>
<p>在電車擁擠的當兒，擠上來一個女子，手裏拎了許多菓盒紙包之類，　面跟着）個婢女　橫的小姑娘，　着一個孩子。</p>
<p>『啊！如此擠呀！』那女人嘆氣說。</p>
<p>『請你這　來吧！』一個乘客讓起－坐位。</p>
<p>『這裏來吧！』又一個乘客。</p>
<p>那女人坐了下去，把東西都放在身旁的一個空位上。</p>
<p>『如此擠呀！』那女人又說。</p>
<p>又是擁的當兒，賣票的大聲喊：</p>
<p>『請進來！請進來！』</p>
<p>乘客拼命的往裏面擠，無論車廂內，月台上，踏脚上都站滿了人。</p>
<p>『辦公時間沒有法子呀！大家原諒　多擠擠！』</p>
<p>到了一站，許多人擠下去，賣票的收了許多錢。</p>
<p>父上來了許多人。</p>
<p>『擠得緊些，多上來幾個，大家方便些！』</p>
<p>過了一站，又收了許多錢。</p>
<h3>于思先生的權宜</h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>現在生活水準是這樣地高，我生活又是那樣地難，所以普通一般人，對於可省的地方，節省了；可不用的地方，割愛了：同時，廢物利用和修舊變新的新花樣也就應運而生。我這偭小貢獻也可說是具中的一種。</p>
<p>刀片，對於一般有鬍子的男子，是多麽地需要，差不多一天都離不了它。據說老頭牌刀片，一片要賣不少的錢，就是普通的，也要二三塊錢。假使說片刀片能用一個月，每片作二塊錢計算，一年就得花去二十四元，雖然拿個人來看，不算什麼，但是把整個上海人口一　，那就可觀了。假定上海有四百萬人，除婦孺和阿　臉不計外，至少有五十萬人是需要刀片的：每人根據上述月用一片計算，那末一年也就要一千數百萬元的化費，，筆錢不是很駭人聽聞的嗎？</p>
<p>現在有個辦　，　將魯鈍的刀片，變成新的一樣，不但試騐過，而且很靈騐。就是，先將刀片放入沸水內，約沒五六分鐘，然後取出，放在玻璃板上（如鏡子，玻璃杯，瓶等都可以），如同磨剪刀一樣，斜斜地磨，把刀片二面，四個刀口，磨上一二分鐘，就等於新發於硎的一般；用鈍了，可以再磨，所以一張刀片至少可用上半年或一年。我想這個方法，除刀片商人悻悻地不同情外，于思先生必定樂於採用的，我爲一般人着想，也就顧不得許多了。</p>
<p>假使依照我的辦法，一片刀片可用半年，那末一個人一年，就可以省下二十塊錢，五十萬人不是可省下一千萬元嗎？將這一千萬元做些慈善事業，不知可能救活多少人？培植多少有志青年呢？</p>
<h3>二月份徵文錄取第十名　怎樣讀書？讀什麼書？</h3>
<p>— 張景雲</p>
<p>從前有三到“讀書法，但是我以爲還不够，還須加上一到，總共爲四到。即口到。眼到·心到·手到。</p>
<p>口到，前人所謂口到，是把一篇文章，能爛熟地背出來，現在雖沒有人提倡背書，但我們如果遇到詩歌以及精彩的文章，總要熟讀把他背出來。</p>
<p>眼到，是要個個字都認得，中國字的一點一撇，外國人的ABCD一點也不可含糊，一點也不可放過，這個，看起來似乎非常容易，然而我國人犯這錯誤的毛病的人，偏是很多，記得有一個人翻譯英文，誤port爲pork於是葡萄酒一變而爲猪肉了。這何嘗不是眼不到的緣故。</p>
<p>心到，是要懂得每一句每一字　意思，要做到這點，則又有三個條件：</p>
<p>（一）參考書—如字典·辭典類書等，論語上說：「了欲善其事，必先利其器。」我們讀書，第一要工具完備。</p>
<p>（二）做文法上的分析。</p>
<p>（三）有時須比較參考，融會貫通。</p>
<p>宋人張載說：「讀書先要會疑」「於不疑處有疑，方是進矣。「父說：「可疑而小疑者，不曾學，學則須疑。」一學貴心悟，守舊有功。」……等。這不是關於心到很重要的幾句語嗎？</p>
<p>手到：（一）標點分段，</p>
<p>（二）做札記，添綫。</p>
<p>讀書更須心靜，然後開卷方才有益，若有意義不明的地方，有注解的，看注解，無注解的悉心思索，自然了悟，這樣方才有進步。從前陳烈是一個記性不好的人，一天，他　了孟子的「事問之道無他，求其放心而己矣。一他大悟，說：「我心不曾收得，爲何記得書。」就關門靜坐讀書達百餘日，以求放心。</p>
<p>我們應該讀什麽書？對於這個問題，我以爲「博」爲最好。我們爲什麼要博？）博是爲參考，（二）博是爲做人。</p>
<p>博是爲參考－－王安石先　答曾子固書裏說：「……讀經即巳，則小不以知經……」我們來推開，來說，便成了「讀一書而已，則不足以知其書。」譬如我們要讀詩經，倘先去硏究一點社會學，文宇學，音韻學，考古學……等等；以後冉去看詩經，就比兩更懂得多了。</p>
<p>達爾文研究生物演進的狀態的時候，費了三十多年的光陰，積了在多材料，但是總想不出一個簡單的答案來，偶然讀馬爾薩斯的人口論便大悟起來，了解了那生物演化原則。</p>
<p>所以我們應該多讀書，無論什麼書都讀，往往一本極平常的書中，藏伏着一個很大的暗示，從書內來用一句話包括起來說，就是王安石所謂：「致其知而後讀」。</p>
<p>傳是做人－－像旗桿似的孤另另地祇有一技之長的人，固然不好，就是說起來什麽都能知曉的人，如一點也不精，彷彿是一張紙，看去雖大，其實沒有什麽實質的，也不好，我們理想中的讀書人，是父精又博，像金字塔一樣，又大，又高，父尖。</p>

<h3>International Situation and East Asia</h3>
<p>The question of what new form the world war is about to take is something that every person concerned about the international situation cannot ignore. The new unfolding of the war is only a matter of time, and time is pressing closer step by step. Therefore, all sorts of guesses, unfounded excitement, and anxieties will inevitably reach the people of East Asia to some extent, and correct explanations are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Before the new war situation unfolds, we naturally have no way to speculate on its true content and trends; however, judging from the facts recently demonstrated by all parties, the core of the problem is the second front in Europe and the consequences of the German-Italian summit. The second front has been called for by the anti-Axis powers for two years, and although it has not yet become a reality, it is now being brought up again due to the new situation in the North African war and seems to be materializing. However, we should pay attention to the significance of the so-called second front: first, its realization depends first on the actual combat power of Britain and the United States, which includes the strength of the navy, army, and air force, the enormous transportation capacity, and safe transportation routes, superior air force, and the maintenance of air supremacy. Are Britain and the United States adequately prepared in these aspects? Looking at a corner of Tunisia, where Britain and the United States have been slow to achieve the so-called "decisive victory" with overwhelming forces, one can already get a considerable hint. Second, its realization cannot be completely dependent on military strength, but also needs to pay attention to the attitude of neutral countries, among which Turkey and Spain play a decisive role. In any case, if Britain and the United States cannot first obtain the support of Turkey and Spain, then the future progress of the war will definitely not be smooth. Third, the psychology and intentions of the people of European countries are also one of the determining forces of the future war. What confidence do Britain and the United States have in this? The so-called Atlantic Charter has long exposed its hypocrisy due to the Indian issue. On the French issue, Britain supports the Gaullist National Committee, while the United States supports the Giraud regime, while also maintaining diplomatic relations with the Vichy government. Will this contradictory situation evoke sympathy in the minds of the European people? If it cannot first win the sympathy of the European people, then the future of the second front will of course be as bleak as ever.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the attitude of Germany and Italy is much clearer. They do not need to put on airs, nor do they need to use all kinds of diplomatic conspiracies and news propaganda. The direct meeting of the heads of state quickly reached a conclusion, followed by action. We not only do not see any contradictions as propagated by the enemy, but on the contrary, even among other small countries in Europe, under the leadership of Germany and Italy, they are as united as one country. This is by no means black and white on paper, but must be seen from the new reality of the total mobilization of Europe. We only need to look at the recent information from the Soviet Union, they have also admitted the vastness of the scope and strength of Germany and Italy's future mobilization. Even General Eisenhower, the supreme commander of the enemy forces in the Mediterranean, in his recent report to reporters on the North African war situation, could not help but admit the "unexpectedly strong" attacking spirit and "combat power that cannot be underestimated" of the German and Italian troops. Therefore, even if the "second front" finally becomes a reality, it is actually just a fleeting soap bubble!</p>
<p>Europe, whether it is North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, or the German-Soviet front, is currently in a period of calm before the storm. This calm will not last long, and a single bullet from any side will break it. However, who has the courage to break this calm is not the core of the problem, because the future victory or defeat does not depend on this. It needs to be asked: who is more adequately prepared today, and whose total mobilization is thorough. As the German Propaganda Minister himself said: "It is most wise to overestimate the enemy's strength and prepare for it" (quoted from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on March 15), and the Asahi Shimbun's commentary (ibid.) said that it is better not to underestimate the impact of the disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the future war situation. It seems to be a loyal admonition to the allied nations. However, from the standpoint of our East Asian nations, we must hold fast to our positions before the future storm and do everything in our power to thoroughly eliminate British and American imperialism. A new world will surely come, and Asia and East Asia cannot be separated.</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Hata Returns to Nanjing: Discusses Impressions of Inspecting North China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced on the 20th: Commander-in-Chief Hata, who had been inspecting the situation in various parts of North China since April 12, returned to Nanjing on the 17th.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Commander-in-Chief Hata of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China met with reporters at the Commander's official residence at 3:30 PM on the 20th and issued the following statement: "I recently inspected various parts of North China, such as Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Beijing, etc. I saw that the soldiers and officers of all units in North China were united and full of vigor. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, they are engaged in combat, security, and training day and night, standing on their own posts and working hard. In particular, regarding Japan's policy towards China this time, the soldiers and officers on the front lines deeply understand its purpose and are gradually putting it into practice. In addition, the revitalized China is a strong supporter of ours, enabling us to concentrate on combat preparations and training. I am deeply gratified by this. Through this inspection opportunity, I had cordial talks with Chairman Zhu of the North China Political Affairs Commission and other key figures. Minister Saltazawa also reported to me on the local situation. The Chinese people in North China are actively reforming their internal affairs, and the Japanese residents are also abandoning their personal interests and deeply understanding the true meaning of Japan's national policy, engaging in the great work of Sino-Japanese cooperation. I am very grateful for the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. The Chongqing side has now lost the remaining strength to act recklessly. The Chinese Communists are still carrying out various counter-propaganda regarding the progress of Japan's policy towards China, such as the return of concessions, the transfer of enemy property, and the reduction and dispersion of troops. Under the current war, a common phenomenon has occurred in various countries around the world, namely the problem of food supply for the people's livelihood. The Communists have also attempted to use the food problem to win over the people in the peaceful areas and drive them into the anti-Japanese camp. However, after the failure of their unfounded and unfulfilled false propaganda last year, such as 'overthrowing Germany this year and overthrowing Japan next year,' they have reached a dead end. In the Imperial Rescript at the opening ceremony of the 27th Diet, Japan stated that its policy towards China would remain unchanged. If peace in Central Asia is not established, China cannot be revived. Therefore, their false propaganda is of no value. Therefore, whether Chinese or Japanese, whether officials or civilians, should trust each other, cooperate with each other, exercise self-discipline and self-restraint, and be cautious in words or actions that could worsen the feelings between the two nations. They should abandon all obstacles to the future of the two nations, and not give them room for counter-propaganda. We should believe that the combined strength of the Greater East Asian nations is enough to defeat Britain and the United States, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. I hereby express the impressions I gained from the inspection as above. At the same time, we will continue to carry out the tasks of combat security of the Japanese army, thoroughly destroy all enemy-like movements, and reaffirm that we will provide great assistance to the great cause of China's revival."</p>
<h3>Political Commissar Hao Guang of the Communist Army Corps Defects: Reveals the Truth About the Chinese Communist Army</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War has had a huge impact on both the Chongqing and Communist armies. They have witnessed the development of the National Government and the sincere cooperation between China and Japan, and they deeply know that the resistance war is not a good plan. Therefore, they have been trying to return and participate in the peace movement, and support the national policy of living and dying together. Hao Guang, the political commissar of the First Regiment of the Sixth Military Region of the Communist bandits, is the youngest regimental-level cadre in the Southern Hebei Communist Army. He has long known that the resistance war is not a good plan, and only peace can save the country. He has long had the intention of returning. Therefore, when he was secretly ordered to infiltrate Wuji County, Hebei Province on February 23 to work, he took the opportunity to surrender to the Japanese military police and was willing to support the National Government as an anti-communist fighter. According to him, the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions for the resistance war, advocated a political offensive last September. It secretly sent Communist elements to infiltrate peaceful areas, and carried out instigation among the Chinese armed forces in order to make them collapse. As for this year's implementation of strategic propaganda, it is regarded as a major propaganda work for the masses. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's war zone expanded, so the Japanese army in North China had to go to the South Pacific to fight. They then ordered their subordinates to avoid fighting with the Japanese army and focus on attacking the security forces and county police, in order to show off their power to the masses. As for political commissars, they are all veteran party members who have been in the party for more than six years. They are selected from party members who have great faith in communism and are full of fighting spirit. The political commissars in each regiment must absolutely obey the instructions of the highest organ of the Chinese Communist Party. If they disagree with the head of the regiment, the political commissar will make the final decision. Therefore, it can be said that the Communist army is completely controlled by the political commissars.</p>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Hao Guang (transliteration), the former political commissar of the Central Regiment of the Sixth War Zone of the Communist Army in Hebei Province, was recently ordered by the Chinese Communist Army to infiltrate Hebei and was captured by the Japanese garrison. He described in detail the various methods used by the Communist Army. After two months of detention, he has agreed with the peace movement of the National Government. He admitted that he had contributed a lot to the transfer of Zhu De's Communist Army to northern Shaanxi in 1934. Since September last year, the Communist Army has repeatedly attempted to smuggle Communist elements into the peaceful areas in order to disrupt the troops in the area. To the extent possible, they avoid conflicts with the Japanese army. This is their consistent policy, and they constantly attack local police groups and security forces in order to demonstrate their strength to the masses. He concluded by saying that the political commissars of the Communist Army are all selected from advanced Communist members and are subject to the command of the headquarters of the Communist Army.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Zhou Visits Chairman Zhu</h3>

<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Jinan, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the 17th, the Japanese army has been carrying out a punitive expedition against 500 Communist bandits in the western Shandong area, destroying the Communist bandits in the east of Guan County. In this battle, 51 Communist bandits were killed and 89 were captured.</p>
<h3>Governor Chu of Zhejiang Province Goes to Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) Governor Chu Shih-ming of Zhejiang Province said that the second phase of the Qingxiang work in the southeast of Taihu Lake will soon be completed, and everything needs to be dealt with urgently.

<h3>Vice Minister of Social Affairs Discusses the Situation of Running Welfare Affairs</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to understand the implementation of wartime social policies and to get a glimpse of the progress of welfare undertakings, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Xi Zewen, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare, yesterday. He was graciously received and gave the following account of the work of the Ministry: Although the Ministry was reorganized from the former Social Affairs Commission, due to the merger of agencies such as the Relief Committee, its duties and the nature of its work are very different. In the future, the Ministry's political guidance to the people will, under wartime conditions, ensure that they cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. In particular, for agriculture and industry, the main goal is to increase production and contribute the maximum amount of manpower and materials. It will also mobilize people from all walks of life to form voluntary organizations for national service and actual movements to enhance the strength of participation in the war. Secondly, the prerequisite for improving the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods is to stabilize social order. At present, prices are soaring, the cost of living is high, and panic is very serious. There are many disabled, poor, and helpless people everywhere, which is very harmful to social order. The Ministry is doing its best to plan. In addition to implementing relief work in accordance with the original methods and in a decisive manner, it has also arranged and organized general charitable facilities for production and relief according to their urgency, so that there are universal relief facilities in large cities and small towns. Recently, the disasters in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have been very serious. The Ministry is now actively preparing to raise funds for relief. Furthermore, the construction of the foundation of society is about the welfare of the people. The Ministry will do its best to advocate and equip itself in every way. The Ministry refers to the successful cases of friendly countries such as Japan, examines the domestic situation, and selectively carries out the important matters in the prescribed duties, such as the training of national physical strength, the guidance of national health, the improvement of the management of labor life, the settlement of labor problems, the promotion of the welfare of the labor community, the relief of social unemployment, the assistance of vocational guidance and adjustment, and the promotion of social simple insurance services. Some have been implemented separately, and others are being planned and implemented. In short, the Ministry has just been reorganized, and many of its political affairs are unprecedented. Although some of the work has been implemented separately, the other parts are being finalized in laws and regulations and drafting plans. There are no achievements to speak of at this time. Please ask about them in the future.</p>

On the 15th, enemy aircraft invaded the vicinity of Hegu City again, strafing several Vietnamese people with machine guns near Roba Oha, 50 kilometers from the border, causing injuries. At that time, Japanese ground fire was very fierce. One enemy Type 1140 fighter plane was hit in the engine and crashed near Laokai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Major General Yanagi Hagi Explains the U.S. Air Raid on Japan Last Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Yanagi Hagi, the Army Press Director of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, made a statement today, roughly stating that the U.S. government had planned to release details recently about the U.S. air raid on Tokyo on April 18th last year. This news caused a great expectation among the American people. However, due to the opposition of the U.S. Army authorities, the U.S. propaganda authorities only made a simple announcement, stating that the U.S. aircraft that attacked Tokyo on April 18th last year took off from an aircraft carrier. Now we can meet the expectations of the American people and announce the details of the U.S. air raid on Tokyo on behalf of the U.S. authorities. (1) "Outline of the U.S. Air Raid Plan": Sixteen North American "1325" medium bombers of the Army Air Force formed a temporary formation, commanded by U.S. Army Colonel Doolittle, first boarded an aircraft carrier. When approaching Japan, they would take off to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. Then, they would fly to the Quzhou airfield in Zhejiang Province to assemble and then fly to Chongqing to join the U.S. Volunteer Group of the Chongqing Air Force. The above is the air raid plan, which is divided into two options: (A) Aiming for a major attack: the first batch would take off from the aircraft carrier before dusk on April 19th, arrive in Japan before sunset, and drop incendiary bombs on factories in the Yokohama area. The second batch would follow the first batch after sunset, arriving in Japan and targeting the fires started by the first batch, as well as bombing the designated targets near Tokyo. Afterwards, they would each determine a direction and fly back to the Chongqing airfield at dawn the next day. (B) If plan A could not be implemented, then daytime bombing would be carried out at an appropriate time. The temporary formation of sixteen aircraft would be divided into five small teams. The first to fourth teams, totaling thirteen aircraft, would be commanded by Colonel Doolittle to bomb the vicinity of Tokyo. The fifth team would be led by Major Pell to bomb Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. (2) "Recruiting Air Force Personnel to Participate in the Bombing of Japan": Before March last year, the U.S. began recruiting personnel from bombing and reconnaissance teams separately. The titles used for recruitment included, for example, "Are you interested in a secret and adventurous important mission?" "Are there any personnel who want to bomb a certain place?" "Are there any personnel who want to serve abroad?" and so on. As a result, a total of one hundred and twenty people responded. After examination by Doolittle, Pell, and Lieutenant Dick, the final decision was made to take eighty people. The motives for their application were mostly to show off in the country, and they were also full of adventure and believed that they could be promoted and paid more in a short period of time. (3) "Pre-Departure Training and Anti-Espionage Measures": These eighty people who were selected went to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida from their respective teams by plane on March 1st last year. Then, Doolittle trained them there for three weeks. On March 27th, they flew to Sacramento Airfield across from San Francisco and departed on April 1st. During this period, the authorities took extremely careful anti-espionage measures, never revealing the intention to bomb Japan. Even the eighty people did not know that they would attack Japan, only that they would be transferred to Africa and South America. Moreover, their training location was on the U.S. mainland coast, where there were almost no East Asians. They were also strictly prohibited from going out during training, and communication with the outside world was prohibited from March 20th. In the letters they sent home before March 20th, they mostly said that they would be transferred to other units, or that they would travel abroad for two months, during which time they could not meet, and that communication would be difficult after leaving the United States. (4) "The Situation After Departure": They took the aircraft carrier Hornet from San Francisco on April 1st. The next day, Sherrit informed the public that the purpose was to bomb Japan. At this time, they were shocked, and most of them felt that there was no hope of survival and became nervous. Some even asked not to participate. However, they then thought that the Japanese were highly moral and treated prisoners very well, so they planned that if the aircraft was hit, they would raise their hands when they parachuted and met the Japanese. Their lives would not be in danger. At this time, they became optimistic again, so they continued to be trained on the ship, and they memorized the direction of entering Japan, the escape route, the method of escaping when encountering an attack plane, and the method of selecting targets on the map. Then, on April 10th, they read the book "What to Know After Being Captured." The poor treatment and supplies they received on the ship were beyond their expectations, and their dissatisfaction was worsening. However, this atmosphere was ultimately suppressed by their curiosity and adventurous spirit about the bombing of Japan. "Implementation of the Air Raid": They initially planned to attack Japan at night on April 19th according to Plan A, but due to various reasons, Plan B was adopted at 8:00 AM on the 18th. At 8:30 AM that morning, when the aircraft carrier was 700 miles from Japan, the first batch of aircraft led by Doolittle took off from the ship one after another. The last aircraft left the ship at 9:20 AM, and each aircraft proceeded to its destination. The attack on Tokyo was at noon. Each aircraft flew over Tokyo and Yokohama and dropped three or four bombs and a box of 120 incendiary bombs, then escaped towards the ocean. The team attacking the Nagoya area initially targeted Inubo Point and headed west. However, after passing the Izu Peninsula, they were chased by Japanese fighters and had to avoid the cloud to reach their destination. Their altitude was 500 feet, so they dropped the bombs and incendiary bombs they were carrying. The enemy aircraft attempting to bomb the Osaka area were afraid of being intercepted by Japanese fighters en route, so they changed their target and dropped the bombs and incendiary bombs they were carrying in Nagoya to reduce their load and flew towards the ocean. Several U.S. aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and several others were damaged. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the U.S. aircraft scattered and flew to Quzhou in Zhejiang Province via Tanegashima near southern Kyushu. Most of them seemed to parachute towards Inubo Point and the land. Doolittle and several others were lucky to escape death, and those whose aircraft were damaged and caught fire were probably dead. The U.S. aircraft attacking Japan did not fully achieve their goals and were almost completely annihilated. In this operation, Doolittle and others did not fly over Japan, but only had their subordinates bomb Japan, while they themselves fled to Zhejiang Province from high altitude over the southern sea of Japan. Another U.S. aircraft landed in Soviet territory.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Reorganize Troops, Offensive Momentum Slows Down, Axis Forces Excel at Mountain Warfare and Defend Lines, Famous U.S. Air Force General Wilson Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) – Land warfare in Tunisia remains quiet today. The British and American armies have suffered losses from their northern offensive on the Mareth Line, and are now engaged in reorganizing their troops and replenishing their ammunition. However, both sides' air forces are actively engaged in reconnaissance and mutual bombing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency, the northern section of the western front in Tunisia saw fierce fighting in the Beja and Medjez el Bab areas on Friday, but gradually subsided by the weekend. General Anderson has had to ease his attacks on the German army's fiercely defended high-ground positions, due to the serious losses suffered by the British army on Thursday and Friday. The military commentator of the London Daily Express admitted on Saturday that Djebel Ang had been retaken by the German army after fierce fighting. The superior British First Army was unable to deploy and has been forced to delay its attempt to break through the Axis line at Medjez el Bab to Tunis again, because it cannot drive the German mountain warfare units from their high-ground flank positions. This delay can be considered a victory for the German army, although the enemy will inevitably use the current pause to prepare for a more intense attack on the German mountain positions. On the southern front of the Tunisian bridgehead, clashes only occurred with British outposts in front of the Axis positions in Enfidaville. General Montgomery seems to have completed the concentration of his artillery and other preparations, so the main attack may begin soon. He has three tank divisions and four or five infantry divisions, making him the strongest of the anti-Axis forces in Africa. In addition, the anti-Axis High Command also has one or two U.S. divisions under his command, making the enemy forces there the strongest in Africa.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters supplemented the battle situation on the 19th as follows: The reason for the current state of stalemate on the Tunisian front is the result of the anti-Axis forces' efforts to reorganize their troops after suffering heavy losses. In particular, the U.S. units suffered heavy losses in the past few days and had to withdraw from the front lines. The anti-Axis forces also admitted to suffering heavy losses and said that the Axis forces' mountain warfare tactics were well-trained and extremely skillful. The anti-Axis forces suffered the greatest losses in tanks, with 200 tanks lost from April 1st to 15th. This shows that tanks occupy a more important position on the Tunisian front than on other fronts. At the same time, it proves that it is almost impossible to use tanks for group attacks in mountainous areas. Moreover, the supply of anti-Axis tanks must be transported over long distances to the front lines, so their losses are even more serious. In addition, the British Air Force has recently suffered great losses in Europe. The British side admitted that the German air defense forces have been greatly strengthened in recent months, with sufficient fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. On April 15th and 16th, the anti-Axis air force lost 119 planes over German territory and occupied Western Europe.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – It was learned here today that U.S. Air Force Captain Wilson, whom American newspapers hailed as a famous American pilot, has been shot down and killed in air combat in Tunisia.</p>
<h3>Germany Celebrates the Führer's Birthday, Göring Issues a Proclamation, Encouraging the Military and Civilians to Pledge Loyalty and Assist the Führer in Completing Great Undertakings</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fourth birthday of the German Führer since the start of the war. The German people will not hold grand celebrations. The German people's feeling of the cruelty of the war in the Eastern Front this winter also has a strong influence on the decision to superficially celebrate the Führer's birthday. The political and military coloring of this birthday can be seen in Göring's proclamation to the nation, the order issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, and the speech by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The German Führer will spend his birthday at headquarters. It is not yet known whether any special receptions will be held. Spring arrived earlier than usual this year, and perhaps the characteristics of the Führer's birthday today will be engagement in special and serious work. The only outward expression of the Führer's birthday will be the national flag-raising celebration.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fifty-fourth birthday of German Führer Hitler. Marshal Göring issued a proclamation to the nation, roughly stating: Today, the entire German nation celebrates the Führer's birthday with fervent sincerity. In this serious time of war, we pray that heaven will bless the Führer and the great work he undertakes. May the Führer remain healthy in the coming year, because the fate of Germany is entirely in the Führer's hands. The past few months have demonstrated the Führer's indomitable strength. The extremist party concentrated its large army, attempting to break through the German lines and open the gateway directly into Germany. However, the Führer's spirit and will inspired the morale of the brave German soldiers, and the defense, filled with sacrifice, was transformed into a brave and victorious offensive. History often does not value the easy success of people, but only those who have a courageous spirit, have experienced the most critical period, and have finally succeeded, can be immortalized in history. Our Führer, in this great war, is practicing the work of liberating the motherland and saving Western culture. For decades, the Führer has served the people and the country with great difficulty, especially in the years of struggle. The Führer is unwilling to rest on his laurels. His simple military posture, his seriousness towards responsibility, and his readiness to make any sacrifice are all the best examples for us. We are now trying our best to follow in his footsteps, especially today, because victory or defeat, survival or death, is at stake. Oh, people of Germany! Today and in the future, we should show the Führer unwavering loyalty and determination to help him complete his great cause.</p>
<p>Goebbels' Speech Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, a celebratory ceremony was held at the Berlin Concert Hall on the eve of the German Führer's birthday. Representatives of the party, state, military, and government, as well as wounded soldiers, ordnance workers, and German men and women, attended the meeting. Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels declared, "The German people today celebrate the Führer's birthday in a particularly solemn mood. The war has now reached the most difficult stage, and the end of the war and the way out are still far away. All those who participate in the war know that they are not fighting to correct borders, but for life and survival. Before September 1939, the enemy could have fulfilled Germany's demands without harming their power, reputation, and prestige. But they saw that Germany was becoming stronger and stronger, as Churchill stated in 1936, so they did not hesitate to create this great war. The survival of the British state depends on the balance of power, but now the balance of power is gradually being lost, and the goals of the war are still unfulfilled. In view of the enemy's propaganda attempts to make people forget the causes of this war, we must trace the beginning of this war in order to understand its development and the current dramatic climax. Before the war, the Führer repeatedly attempted to limit armaments and avoid war, and even after the war broke out, he attempted to end it as soon as possible. But these efforts were ultimately ineffective, because the enemy intended to wage war and spared no effort to promote it. The enemy only wants to enjoy personal wealth and unlimited power, and they are indifferent to the suffering of their people. Therefore, war traders do not understand the true interests of their own people. They hate the National Socialist people's movement, they hate the National Socialist Germany and the Germans, and especially they hate the German Führer. They believe that the Führer has infringed on the interests of others in the scope of state affairs. They had already prepared for war and then launched it at the time they deemed appropriate. This is the cause and purpose of the current war. In the enemy camp, some politicians are typical of the world that the Germans hate. At the same time, on the German side, the world that the German people love and protect is represented by one person. Someone once said that the German Führer is typical of the German people, and this is indeed the case. The characteristics of hard work, perseverance, and deep concern for the suffering of the people and mankind can be seen in the Führer's face. The strength of the Führer's personality is increasing day by day, and its effect cannot be overcome by the enemy's rumors and propaganda. The past two terrible winters have proved that the German Führer and the German people are determined to correct the historical mistakes of the autumn of 1918 and strive for the final great victory. On the eve of the Führer's fifty-fourth birthday, the German people express their blessings to the Führer personally and to his historical work, which is a manifestation of loyalty and faith. In this war, the best moral weapon is the loyalty and unconditional obedience of the German front and the nine million people behind it to one person." Mr. Guo concluded, "We believe that Germany will be victorious because we believe in the Führer. We will always be loyal to the Führer and follow him. The Führer is our faith and hope. A nation that has such a Führer and unconditionally follows him must be able to accomplish great things." The last program of the celebration was the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.</p>
<h3>The Reality of British and American Propaganda Strategies. American Propaganda Strategies: Using Radio Waves to Exaggerate Post-War Management</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Kotada, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 12th) It goes without saying that the main base for American domestic and foreign propaganda is the Wartime Information Bureau. After a major reorganization last June, this Bureau included four intelligence-related agencies: the Bureau of Data Statistics (Director Markley Hugh), the Government Gazette Bureau (Director Millet), the Intelligence Department within the Emergency National Defense Adjustment Bureau, and the Overseas Intelligence Department within the Intelligence Adjustment Bureau. According to the New York Times, the Wartime Information Bureau, touted as "the most powerful and unified" propaganda agency in the world, is responsible for unifying and managing the propaganda intelligence of all government agencies directly under the President, giving it considerable authority. The man who heads the Bureau and embodies the energetic work ethic of the American faction is Elmer Davis. Davis was originally the Washington Bureau Chief of (American News Agency), where he demonstrated his remarkable talent, later becoming a reporter for Radio News, gaining fame throughout the United States. He was recruited by Roosevelt following the reorganization of the Information Bureau last June. Davis relies on two people as his right and left hands: first, Milton Eisenhower, the brother of General Eisenhower, the commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, who serves as the Director-General of the Information Bureau; and second, Robert Sherwood, who holds the important position of Overseas Minister. Although Sherwood is known as a playwright, he is even more famous as one of the most influential drafters of Roosevelt's speeches.</p>
<p>Conflict Between the Military and the Information Bureau</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are two other individuals within the Information Bureau who play indispensable roles in American domestic and foreign propaganda. One sits in the War Department in Washington, and the other sits in the Navy Department; both are specifically responsible for drafting official communiqués. In the Navy Department is retired Navy Major DR Hill, and in the War Department is retired Colonel FV FitzGerald. Both men have experience participating in the previous World War and are primarily journalists by trade. Among the intelligence officers in various government departments, they are considered the most agile. These two men frequently consult directly with their superiors, Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chief of Naval Operations King, and each demonstrates their masterful skills. As mentioned earlier, this work is naturally subject to the control and management of the Wartime Information Bureau. However, due to the political utilization of American "war situation communiqués," friction and disputes frequently arise. Recently, the American magazine "Life" published an article titled "Dancing War Situation Communiqués," exposing the behind-the-scenes events and revealing the chaotic and disorganized nature of American war situation communiqués. The full text is presented below:</p>
<p>"Since the start of the war, the American public has been completely kept in the dark about true information regarding the war. In Washington, there is a daily manipulation of the truth about the war between the military and the Wartime Information Bureau, handled by clumsy and inept country dancers. Even the White House, where the Supreme Commander of the American Army and Navy is located, and every agency down to the lowest level of wartime information, are dancing wildly out of step. This situation raises the question: 'Doesn't the American public care about the gravity of the war?' Even worse, from the very beginning, the public has had the impression that 'regardless of the truth, the Army and Navy authorities conceal any information that is unfavorable to the United States.' The appointment of Elmer Davis as the new head of the Wartime Information Bureau was originally meant to alleviate this public resentment, but the public's expectations have been completely betrayed. Even with Davis in charge, there is no 'creativity' in the war situation reports from the Army and Navy. Instead, Davis has engaged in arguments with military intelligence officers.</p>
<p>Broadcasting as the Mainstay of Propaganda</p>
<p>In reality, the Overseas Department is at the heart of the Wartime Information Bureau. Out of the 3,000 employees of the Information Bureau, half—1,400—are in the Overseas Department, and the majority of their work is radio broadcasting. Since taking office in 1933, Roosevelt has relied heavily on the skillful use of radio broadcasting, such as the so-called "fireside chats," to achieve his insatiable ambitions, even rejecting many strong arguments. In both domestic and foreign propaganda, the United States has invested the most effort in utilizing radio waves for combat. Currently, the Overseas Department broadcasts overseas 2,688 times a week, using twenty languages. There are twenty-one in-network broadcasting stations and thirty-three broadcasting stations overseas. This array clearly demonstrates the above fact. Among these overseas broadcasts, the greatest focus is currently on North Africa, with considerable effort also directed towards broadcasting to Turkey, Switzerland, and Sweden. As for the propaganda strategy, there is no fixed course; rather, it inverts right and wrong and calls black white, adapting to the listener. For example, pre-breakfast broadcasts are filled with self-deception; for Sweden, astronomical figures of military strength are cited, accompanied by lengthy explanations, thoroughly showcasing sophistry; and for Africa, the propaganda is completely fabricated.</p>
<p>The Substance of Foreign Strategies</p>
<p>The above only describes propaganda using radio broadcasts. In addition, there are foreign strategies based at the White House, directly following Roosevelt's instructions, which are truly the most frightening. These strategies are based on three principles: (1) weakening the enemy's will to fight, (2) enticing neutral countries, and (3) arousing the fighting spirit of the home country's people. Following these principles, the United States is currently focusing on the so-called post-war management issue. This involves greatly exaggerating post-war issues such as national borders, ethnicities, and the economy, inserting music, and broadcasting them to entice neutral countries with post-war benefits and to boost the morale of the home country's people. This program is not just something imagined from the outside. The recent American newspaper, the New York Sun, boldly stated: "The most anticipated breeding ground for the effect of these strategies that the United States is spreading throughout the world is the Americanism that has permeated the world since World War I—the longing for an American lifestyle based on a high level of consumerism." Here, we cannot help but recognize that the United States will further change its methods and tactics, using all its might and strategies to ensure that this breeding ground blossoms into the "incarnation of defeatism."</p>
<p>Ridicule from Neutral Countries</p>
<p>However, recently, a powerful Swedish newspaper criticized this series of war-related management issues and the exaggerated propaganda of the Anglo-American-Soviet opposition, which is used as a countermeasure, saying:</p>
<p>"In the end, these are nothing more than worn-out clichés of 'democracy,' which is merely a façade for concealing the true goals of the Anglo-American war. Their intention is not only to target the anti-Axis countries but also to draw neutral countries into their camp. We neutral countries have never been deceived by this substitute, reeking of democracy."</p>
<p>In short, the final issue is the struggle between war aims. The Axis powers' war aims, based on the justice of heaven and earth, are clearly understood and grasped by the people. The ideological strategies of this "agitator politician" Roosevelt will not succeed. (Translated by Ding from the Yomiuri-Hochi, April 14th)</p>
<h3>German-Turkish Goods Exchange Agreement Signed: Promoting Economic Ties Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) It was officially announced yesterday that the German-Turkish trade agreement was signed here on April 18. The agreement stipulates the exchange of goods valued at 120 million marks, with the deadline for the exchange being May 1, 1944. A communiqué was released after the signing of the agreement: "Representatives of Germany and Turkey have been conducting economic negotiations in the Turkish capital in recent weeks.

The agreement will remain in effect indefinitely unless either party provides notice of termination. It is stipulated that the quantity and value of goods to be exchanged by May 31, 1944, is set at 120 million marks. Germany will supply Turkey with industrial products beneficial to Turkey, and Turkey will supply Germany with raw materials. The negotiations were conducted in an extremely friendly spirit, further demonstrating the mutual understanding between the two countries. The agreement is based on the German-Turkish agreement of October 9, 1941, guaranteeing the exchange of goods between the two countries and promoting their economic ties."</p>
<h3>British Near East Commander Departs Turkey: Rumors of Headquarters Relocation</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) British Near East Commander Wilson, after attending a meeting with the Turkish General Staff for four days, departed publicly at midnight yesterday, but the destination is unknown.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Cairo: Commander of the British forces in the Middle East, Wilson, plans to move his headquarters from Cairo to Poulmen or Hanterren, in the northern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon. It is generally believed that this move is intended to find a suitable base for the anti-Axis forces to launch operations in the Balkans.</p>
<h3>Italian Crown Prince Inspects Bombed Areas: French Official Announcement of Air Raid Casualties</h3>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) Today, Stefani News Agency reported that the Crown Prince inspected the La Spezia area, which was most severely damaged in the recent air raids, yesterday afternoon. He also visited various hospitals in the city to comfort the injured. The people cheered along the streets where the Crown Prince passed.</p>
<p>Paris, 19th (Central News Agency) According to figures released by the French authorities today, the number of deaths and injuries from British and American bombings of French cities up to April 6 of this year totaled 18,789, including 6,349 deaths and 12,440 injuries. More than 200,000 people are homeless. These figures include those evacuated from dangerous areas. Since France signed the armistice agreement with Germany, the number of attacks on France has increased year by year. In 1940, France was bombed six times, thirty-six times in 1941, and the first three months of this year increased to thirty-one times. In reality, the cities and towns in the coastal areas of France, such as the Seine-Maritime and Ille-et-Vilaine regions, have all been heavily bombed.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting at the Mouth of the Kuban River: German Forces Seize the Initiative; New Elite Units Cross the Kerch Strait for Reinforcement</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) According to Eastern Front news, German forces in the Kuban River area have now completely seized the initiative in the battle. On the morning of the 19th, they launched a fierce offensive along the entire line, attacking the Soviet defense line three times in succession, inflicting great damage. They finally broke through at one point. The Soviet army believes that the Kuban River estuary area is the only base for the German summer offensive, so they are extremely worried about the future of the battle. The German side is currently increasing new elite troops through the Kerch Peninsula to encircle the Soviet army. The Soviet army's attempt to restrain the German army seems to have begun a counteroffensive south of Novorossiysk. According to German front-line news, the Soviet army has suffered fatal damage and retreated in a panic. Moreover, the German Air Force is extremely active throughout the Eastern Front, which is very similar to the situation before the German summer offensive last year.</p>
<h3>German U-boats in the Atlantic Attack British Convoy</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Central News Agency) London officially announced today that there was a fierce battle between submarines and aircraft in the Atlantic, lasting four days. It is said that two important convoys, approaching the British Isles, were suddenly discovered by a large German submarine force and began attacking in an area beyond the protection of the British Air Force. The British side admitted to heavy losses because the torpedoes fired by the German side all hit their targets. Later, the convoy entered the range of aircraft from the British Coastal Command, and British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and Belgian aircraft took off one after another to attack the German submarines. They attacked continuously nineteen times in four days. As a result, the London authorities have not yet been able to determine whether the German submarines were damaged or sunk. According to Reuters, the Coastal Command sent a signal to the attacking aircraft squadrons, saying that since the aircraft went into battle, the attacks by German submarines have been greatly reduced, so there is little doubt that a large number of ships have been rescued from danger.</p>
<h3>Turkey Establishes Embassy in Brazil</h3>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency) Stefani News Agency reported today that the Turkish Council of Ministers decided to establish an embassy in Brazil and legations in South Africa and Canada. Previously, Turkey only had a chargé d'affaires in Brazil.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Mobilizes Stars to Work in Munitions Factories</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th (Central News Agency) According to reports from Hollywood: Due to the sharp reduction in manpower, the US government has decided to mobilize Hollywood male and female stars to work in munitions factories. In the first step, 20,000 stars and film workers will be assigned to work at the Lockheed-Vega aircraft factory for four hours a day.</p>
<h3>Tour of the "Atlantic Wall"</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin, 4th) At 10 p.m. on March 27th, amidst the blaring of air raid sirens, we departed Berlin by car and arrived on the Dutch coast near the coast the following afternoon. The wreckage of the British aircraft that attacked Berlin last night could be seen in the forest, charred and burned. Guided by the German General Headquarters, I, representing the Japanese news reporters stationed in Germany, along with reporter representatives from five or six other countries, inspected the German defense facilities against England in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Convoy in the Strait of Dover</p>
<p>The quiet spring waves of the North Sea, despite the distant aerial battle last night, this place remains a silent battlefield. Waiting for the enemy's fortifications, two, three... countless layers have been completed. On the dikes unique to Holland, rising high from the water's surface, sturdy concrete defenses are built. Behind the concrete walls, layers upon layers of barbed wire obstacles are strung. In the rear, anti-tank guns are placed everywhere. This is the so-called modern "Great Wall."</p>
<p>The hotels and residences behind the defenses are quiet and deserted, no longer the luxurious sight they were a year ago. Now, everything has been transformed into a fortress. Countless mines are densely packed like beehives.</p>
<p>Standing on the defense lines, gazing at the vast surface of the Strait of Dover, three merchant ships appeared in our binoculars amidst the misty clouds, seemingly a convoy departing from Rotterdam, followed by a German warship. We inspected the various coastal locations from south to north, and the structure of the first-line defenses was generally the same. Presumably, the entire coastline of the Netherlands is the same.</p>
<p>Interplay of War and Peace</p>
<p>Anti-aircraft guns and barracks are completely concealed in camouflage-colored grass. Obstacles are scattered vertically and horizontally across hills, fields, and even roads. Cattle and horses leisurely graze and rest, and lush green vegetables sprout from the fields. In the glass greenhouses, in the early spring flower gardens, daffodils and crocuses compete for beauty, their yellow and purple colors reflecting each other, symbolizing the intertwining of war and peace.</p>
<p>Not far from the general coastal defenses, we entered the most important point of the defense formation, a massive fortress. Anti-aircraft gun emplacements and substantial cannons all had their muzzles pointed towards the Strait of Dover. In this location, trenches deeper than our height have been dug crisscross. Concrete barracks have been constructed underground near the anti-aircraft guns and cannons.</p>
<p>The general explaining to us said, "The installations are essentially completed. In the fully constructed position, the ground is covered with leather, and there are neat walking paths, as if you are in a park. The anti-aircraft guns are camouflaged in green, hidden everywhere. Soldiers looking at the sky from the central observation platform use a special sighting device, and the surrounding anti-aircraft guns automatically move in the same angle as the observation platform, firing at enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Sincere Artillery Commander</p>
<p>In the same focal area, we saw the third defensive formation. The giant cannons were as massive as the large Buddhas in temples, with half of the huge barrel buried in a concrete and steel foundation. These giant cannons can be seen everywhere. No fleet can ever hope to approach this coastline.</p>
<p>The sincere commander of the artillery battery, with the determination to live and die with the fortress, guards the fortress. He allowed us to tour the interior of the fortress but did not answer any questions. Nevertheless, we persisted and asked the following questions:</p>
<p>Q: "How thick is the armor on the top part?"</p>
<p>A: "That cannot be said."</p>
<p>Q: "Is it very thick?"</p>
<p>A: "Very thick, probably can withstand the bombing."</p>
<p>The area around the gun emplacement was still full of steel frames and many machines.</p>
<p>Q: "Has this cannon ever been fired?"</p>
<p>A: "It has been fired. I fired it myself, of course, in practice! But this cannon can be fired at any moment."</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Invention</p>
<p>Leaving the gun emplacement, we went to see the ammunition depot. This is a modern rock house. Because the walls were very thick, the room was small. To the untrained eye, bombs of any weight could not penetrate it. When the switch was turned, we saw shells as tall as children piled up like mountains, fully prepared. The commander stroked the shell's head, but suddenly noticed that I was Japanese. Breaking his silence, he said:</p>
<p>"The structure of this fuse is an invention of the Japanese Navy. It was tested for the first time in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, resulting in a great victory, and therefore it was produced in large quantities. Since then, the technology has been further improved, and the British and Americans have created almost identical things. Before, when shells intersected with hard iron plates at an oblique angle, they often could not fire smoothly."</p>
<p>We moved to the anti-aircraft gun emplacements densely distributed within the important positions and entered the central command tower. While the captain was explaining the observation and command, the air in the room suddenly tensed up. "Alert! Alert!" "Those are enemy planes!" "Look at the observation tower!" We immediately went up and looked. At an altitude of 6,000 meters, it was difficult to tell whether the incoming aircraft were British or American. We saw five twin-engine bombers, followed by fighter planes, escaping the anti-aircraft fire's encirclement and flying towards Rotterdam. The reporter cannot accurately list the details of the German defensive positions on the Dutch coastline.</p>
<p>A Second Front is Impossible</p>
<p>Based on what we have seen, firstly, in addition to utilizing the terrain, sturdy concrete defenses have been added. Moreover, emplacements of mines, anti-aircraft guns, and cannons are densely deployed, with mobile artillery in place. Secondly, in the authentic fortress area, there are preparations to destroy the fleets covering the landing troops and the rear transport ships. The enemy will be destroyed before they land. Thirdly, tank ditches. The structure of the tank ditches is ingenious. Even if part of the coastal defense is broken through by enemy tanks, it is easy to stop them. In addition, barbed wire, canals utilizing the terrain, and countless glass greenhouses buried in the coast are all extremely unfavorable to tank progress. So, if the enemy does not attack from the sea, but chooses a day with the dense fog unique to the Netherlands and suddenly uses parachute troops to assist the landing troops in front from behind, what will happen in that case? Various large and small units are deployed in each small area in the rear to prevent any eventuality.</p>
<p>If the enemy attempts a reckless invasion, they will encounter strong resistance due to the resolute will of the German soldiers and officers. However, in addition to human will, there must be sufficient material equipment. Germany is a country that is fully prepared both materially and spiritually.</p>
<p>After visiting various defense facilities, there are many impressions. First, this massive work was probably created in a short period of one to one and a half years. This is not only an astonishing problem, but it is also a question of whether such defensive equipment can be completed in one year. For example, those who have seen the state of the French coastal defenses a year ago cannot estimate that the defensive progress will be advanced to this point a year later.</p>
<p>Second, in order to crush the hope of the Anglo-American Second Front, Germany's defenses completely control and suppress the foothold that facilitates rear transport and locations with landing conditions.</p>
<p>We feel that it is almost impossible for the British and Americans to open a Second Front on the North Sea and Atlantic coasts. (Xiang: Translated from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, April 7th)</p>
<h3>India-Burma Border: Heroic Achievements of the Japanese Army - Breaking Through the Natural Barrier of the Mauli Mountains - Dealing a Devastating Blow to the British Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangyuan, 20th: Since the Japanese army encircled and annihilated British-Indian troops north of Rihe, the enemy's attempt to recapture Rihe has failed, and the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road has become a mere illusion. This not only deals a profound blow to the enemy camp, but also, due to the success of the Japanese army's decisive battle, their position on the southwestern frontline has become even more advantageous. This will have a significant impact on the future course of the war and is therefore worthy of great attention. From a strategic point of view, this decisive battle can truly be called a classic annihilation war, such as the battles near Abao Ku Hua and Kang Zuo Ke on the banks of the Kaladan River, the battle of Jizi Ou on the east bank of the Mauli River, and the battle near Mengjia La An, i.e., Indian-Burmese border, on the west side of the Mauli Mountains. All of these were rapid and thorough encirclement and annihilation battles, which is one of the major characteristics of this operation. Especially in the annihilation battle near Indian, the enemy's Sixth Brigade was attacked for the first time, resulting in a devastating blow. Subsequently, the enemy's 47th Brigade, advancing from the north and south, was annihilated. Furthermore, seven kilometers north of Indian, in cooperation with another Japanese army unit advancing northward from the south, the remaining enemy was encircled and almost completely annihilated. Another Japanese army unit advanced northward through the central part of the Mauli Mountains, launching three encirclement and annihilation battles on the south bank of the Mingjiangte River (88 kilometers north of Saijiwa, flowing into the Bay of Bengal). At that time, the unit, with only a company-sized force, attacked 2,000 enemy troops, resulting in 500 enemy deaths, and the remainder were completely routed. In the above three encirclement and annihilation battles, although the Japanese army's equipment was slightly inferior and its strength was weak, it was still able to achieve repeated victories within the firing range of enemy warships along the coast. Furthermore, in terms of the true nature of the battles, as reported previously, the enemy had an absolute advantage in artillery fire at the time, and was in contact with aircraft. For example, in one area alone, on the front of Donbek, the enemy deployed 38 artillery pieces. The British Wei Beier proudly stated that Donbek was the army's training ground, and at its maximum rate of fire, it did not hesitate to waste up to 4,000 shells on just one target, and also used bombers to challenge the Japanese army day after day. The enemy army also had complete transportation, sufficient food supplies, and excellent equipment, and also defended the natural barriers to resist the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army still overcame the difficulties of ammunition and food supply, carried out river-crossing operations, and conquered the natural barriers obscured by dense forests, with a small number of infantry units fighting bravely. After quickly conquering the difficulties in terrain, the elite Japanese army often appeared unexpectedly, such as when passing through the Mauli Mountains, from Iwakit on the east side of the mountains to the west side of the mountains, without using the enemy's original mule tracks, but entirely through the steep and dangerous highlands where no one had ever set foot, launching surprise night attacks on the enemy's rear, thus greatly succeeding in this annihilation operation, which is truly worth writing about. Moreover, in this operation, the Arakan people actively cooperated with the Japanese army in transporting food, ammunition, and the wounded in the front lines of gunfire and bullets, which is truly noteworthy. In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning, that is, although the British army fought fiercely with the Japanese army, it still exposed the chaos of the British command and the weakness of the commanders' judgment everywhere. One example is that the British high command initially believed that the Japanese army could never break through the natural barrier of the Masi Mountains, which was the biggest reason for the British army's defeat. Furthermore, because the Japanese army broke through the Masi Mountains and occupied Indian, annihilating the British Sixth Brigade, the retreat route of the British 47th Brigade was also cut off. By the time the brigade commander, Wen Balai, learned that the Japanese army had already occupied Indian, it was too late. His subordinates fell into a state of panic and were annihilated by the Japanese army on the way to retreat north. Wen Balai himself is still wandering in the Mauli Mountains south of Indian. If he is not captured by the Japanese army, he will either starve to death or become food for wild beasts, which is also unknown. In short, the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to reverse the decline and echo the counter-offensive against Japan in the Solomon Islands, wanted to open a path in the west. But to this day, it can be confirmed that their attempt will never be realized. This is naturally a very significant blow to the anti-Axis camp. The British army's attack on Arakan has resulted in the Japanese army's counterattack, and because the Japanese army has occupied all the important strongholds, the Japanese army's strategic position on the India-Burma border has become even more advantageous. In the future battles in that area, the Japanese army has also gained complete initiative.</p>
<p>Reasons for the British Army's Failure</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The Times reported that there are two reasons for the British army's defeat on the India-Burma border: (1) Difficulty in supply, because the Arakan area is densely forested, with crisscrossing lakes and swamps, and lacks bridges, so transportation is extremely difficult, while the Japanese army, because it has controlled the mouth of the Mauli River, can continuously supply Donbekula Qiangke from Rihe. (2) The British-Indian army cannot control the sea control of the Bay of Bengal, and there are insufficient ships, so to occupy Rihe, it must seize the Andaman Islands to ensure the sea control of the Bay of Bengal. The British army is currently exhausted from the North African campaign, so it cannot allocate sufficient ships for use in that area.</p>
<p>Superior Japanese Tactics</p>
<p>The Times, April 8th: Because the Japanese army has built solid trench positions at high places and defended them vigorously, it can be called "the second Battle of Puna." Moreover, the Japanese army's camouflage and concealment are extremely clever, causing the British army to miscalculate the main force of the Japanese army at ordinary times. For example, when British army reconnaissance once reported that the Japanese army had withdrawn from the Mauli Peninsula, the Japanese army's flanking encirclement often surprised the British army. In order to eliminate the side threat, the British army had to retreat repeatedly. The use of mechanized weapons is completely inappropriate in that area, so tanks have not been used. (Impact of Defeat)</p>
<h3>Japan Discusses and Passes Measures to Strengthen Shipping During Wartime</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: In order to strengthen the essential supply of berths and port handling capacity during wartime, the Japanese government has previously passed the Wartime Administrative Special Measures Law and the Temporary Measures for Permission and Approval, etc., and formulated wartime special cases of the Customs Law. The imperial decree on two special cases, concerning the working hours of customs and temporary opening hearings, has been officially decided by the cabinet meeting on the 20th, and after its recent promulgation, it will be implemented from May 1st.</p>
<h3>Deterioration of Soviet-Polish Relations Due to the Massacre of Polish Officers Case</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th: Due to the Soviet Union's massacre of more than 10,000 Polish officers near Smolensk, Soviet-Polish relations have suddenly deteriorated. The Polish government-in-exile in London convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 18th, and it is said that it has entrusted the International Red Cross to investigate the truth of the incident. According to a telegram from Moscow, the Zhenli Bao (Pravda) editorial on the 19th strongly denied the incident, criticized the attitude of the Polish government, and said that disputes have frequently arisen between the Soviet and Polish countries since the war, and it is now at the stage of complete rupture.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Giraud Memorandum to de Gaulle</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th: London news today: The Giraud memorandum to de Gaulle on April 1st was released in London yesterday, so as to correct the rumors of strained associations in the outside world. In the memorandum, Giraud proposed that during the period before France is liberated, a council should first be established to exercise French sovereignty. The council will quickly bypass into French territory, and as soon as the entire territory is liberated, the council will hand over power to the provisional government formed by the representative assembly. This body will represent France in peace discussions and determine the date of parliamentary elections.</p>

<h3>The Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops Will End at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war the previous year, the Silver and Money Shop Guilds of this city, in order to meet the needs of the environment, specially jointly established the Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops to handle all emergency matters for the members of the industry. Now, because the authorities have adjusted financial institutions and promulgated the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions and implemented them, the entire financial situation has tended to stabilize, and it is also appropriate that the authorities are implementing wartime economic policies and adjusting wartime economic institutions, and are actively proceeding, and the Silver and Money Shop Guilds are also strengthening their organizations at any time in accordance with the laws, so there is no need to set up the Provisional Federation of Silver and Money Shops. It is reported that the association will end and be abolished at the end of this month, and if there are necessary events in the future, the Silver and Money Shop Guilds will still convene joint meetings to deal with important issues.</p>

<h3>The Minister of Food Calls on Various Industries - Instructions on the Organizational Policy of Guilds - All Directors and Supervisors of the Commercial Control Association Participate - Hoping for Self-Government and Control of Commercial Organizations</h3>
<p>The Minister of Food, Gu Baoheng, convened representatives of various major food industries and all directors and supervisors of the National Commercial Control Association at the Huamao Hotel yesterday afternoon for a tea party, and gave earnest instructions on the policy of organizing guilds for major food industries.</p>
<p>Representatives of Various Industries Attended</p>
<p>In addition to Minister Gu, the competent authorities who attended included Director Zhou Shian, Section Chief Ji Hua, Assistant Huang Zhikai, Assistant Wang Suliang, Director Ye Yichang, Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Food Administration, Wang Zhigang, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, Jiang Kesheng, Director of the Aquatic Products Bureau, etc. The attendees from the food industry included: Sun Zhongli, Li Ying, Wang Yuqing from the flour industry, Lu Wenshao and Fu Qiangeng from the rice industry, Chen Ziyi, Jiang Shizhi, Jiang Hongbin, and He Xiyuan from the miscellaneous grain industry, Xie Meisheng and Liu Bin from the animal husbandry industry, Zheng Yuanxing and Yan Youqing from the egg industry, Huang Jiangquan and Zhu Chunbo from the sugar industry, and Shen Shaoa from the edible oil industry. Tang Shoumin, the chairman of the National Commercial Control Association, and all directors and supervisors below the supervisor Wen Lanting attended.</p>
<p>Self-Government and Control of Commercial Organizations</p>
<p>First, Minister Yuan gave a speech, instructing the policy on the organization of guilds in the food industry, hoping that the food industry guilds would be established as soon as possible in the shortest possible time, and encouraging the guilds to abandon their prejudices and unite. If each industry has difficulties, they can consult with the Commercial Control Association or request a solution. Finally, he explained the important regulations for the organization of industry guilds to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. Then, Tang Shoumin gave a speech, urging the relevant industry guilds to speed up the organization under the management of the Food Department, and considering that the recent wheat problem is very serious, and the raw material of flour is wheat, he hoped that the miscellaneous grain industry and the flour industry could have practical contact. He also said that the Commercial Control Association hopes for "self-government and control of commercial organizations." The government only provides guidance and supervision from the sidelines, so it is hoped that all industries can deeply understand and cooperate sincerely. Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Food Bureau, then delivered a speech. Finally, Gu Duzhang briefly discussed the current situation of the material transfer method. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>This City Starts Epidemic Prevention Injections Yesterday; Health Sub-Offices Send Additional Doctors; Neighborhood Units in Each District Assist in Implementation</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday (the 20th), all districts of this city have comprehensively launched an epidemic prevention injection campaign. In the urban area, the epidemic prevention injection teams organized by the Municipal Health Bureau are divided into five general teams and forty sub-teams, and are dispatched to various districts for injections. In the two concession areas, each health department and sub-office has uniformly sent additional doctors for injections, and dispatched cars to patrol and inject along the way, with the assistance of the neighborhood unit authorities. At the same time, each neighborhood unit independently designates hospitals or hires doctors to implement door-to-door injections. The Chengdu district of the Public Concession is even stricter, with the police station ordering each neighborhood unit to inform residents to get injections as soon as possible, and sending personnel to investigate. Those without epidemic prevention certificates or who disobey the advice to get injected will have their citizen certificates and household rice tickets revoked. In the districts of the Hongkou Naval Garrison Area, the district chiefs personally supervise the self-defense corps members, using warning ropes along the way, and the navy assists in checking the epidemic prevention certificates of pedestrians on the road. Those without certificates are given injections on the spot, so the results are very good. It is expected that by the end of May, all five million residents of the city can be completely injected.</p>
<p>Discovery of Epidemic Disease Must Be Reported</p>
<p>The authorities of each district have also issued notices, instructing the heads of each neighborhood unit and household to be responsible for reporting any outbreaks of epidemic diseases within their respective areas to the competent authorities, so as to implement disinfection and other tasks, in order to prevent infection and maintain public health and the health and safety of the people during the summer. If there is any concealment of information, once verified, severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<p>Residents of New Zha Start Receiving Injections</p>
<p>The New Zha District Neighborhood Unit Committee issued a notice yesterday, stating that from the 21st of this month to the 21st of May, each joint neighborhood unit must send ten self-defense corps members, divided into morning and afternoon shifts, with ten people per shift, to serve at the injection site. The offices of each neighborhood unit must send self-defense corps members with household registers to call out names on the spot and inject them one by one. The order of each neighborhood unit should be determined by each joint neighborhood unit in advance and implemented on a daily basis. The location is determined by each joint neighborhood unit within its jurisdiction in an appropriate place. The doctors for the injections are responsible for dispatch by the health teams of each district.</p>
<p>Residents of the Southern City Undergo Inspection</p>
<p>In order to prevent the outbreak of cholera due to the recent hot weather, the Fuji Unit of the Allied Central Epidemic Prevention Team, led by Lieutenant Tanaka, along with seven military doctors, two military policemen from the Penglai Road Military Police Team in the Southern City, and many long-term police officers, went to the Caojiazhai area within the jurisdiction of the Pingyangqiao Substation in the Southern City yesterday morning to inspect residents' stool for bacterial infections. The inspection was completed at about 1:00 PM. According to statistics, more than one hundred men and women were inspected. At that time, the area around the residence was assisted by patrol officers and police officers to maintain order and cut off traffic until the inspection was completed and the original state was restored. At the same time, military police were also dispatched to the iron gate of the Bili'en French Concession on Nanyang Bridge to assist the long-term police in checking pedestrians entering the Southern City from the concession. Those who did not have a "Cholera Prevention Injection Certificate" were immediately injected by a doctor to prevent the occurrence of cholera.</p>
<p>Rodent Extermination Campaign Yields Good Results</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the rodent extermination campaign in the French Concession has yielded very good results. As of now, dozens of households and shops are still submitting the rats they have caught to the health authorities for extermination every day. It is said that although the French Health Department has not stipulated the number of rats that each household must catch or set a time limit, the authorities often provide residents in certain areas where rats congregate with rat traps and order them to catch them diligently.</p>

<p>The authorities have made the greatest determination regarding the inspection of warehouse inventories, so market prices have fallen sharply, especially for cotton cloth, cotton yarn, soap, and matches.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Re-discussing the Banking Industry Merger Movement</h3>
<p>Regarding the merger of small banks and the banking self-discipline system, I have repeatedly elaborated recently, sincerely believing that if the banking industry can strictly and properly exercise self-discipline, then the business of the banks can gradually get on track and will not go astray; in order to seek further cooperation, the banking merger movement is an inevitable phenomenon in the second step of banking development. Regardless of whether the authorities are indeed considering merger methods, for the sake of the banking industry itself, it is better to have the industry plan for it early than to have the government enforce it in the future.</p>
<p>Originally, for the banking industry to develop on the right track and shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the current and future economy, it is truly impossible to succeed without concentrating the power of the banks. Now, the newly established banks in Shanghai are like bamboo shoots after a rain, and their strengths are quite uneven. The backgrounds of each bank are also very different. The current situation is scattered, and there is no need to shy away from saying that this will be very dangerous in the long run. Looking at the economic and financial situation of our country, and examining the development trend of banks in advanced countries, I feel that the banking industry in our country is still not suitable for the modern natural trend; although there are bound to be different positions among the banks in each industry, there are many similarities in nature and the same directors and supervisors. Why not merge them? Moreover, bank mergers have been carried out vigorously in Japan, and there are many precedents in our country as well. Therefore, in addition to criticism, we hope that respected and enthusiastic people in the banking industry will step forward and design a proper merger method for the government authorities to adopt and implement, which is truly a blessing for the future of the important financial industry.</p>
<h3>Strictly Implementing the "Self-Discipline System": Banking and Money Industries Actively Recover Loans</h3>
<p>In order to curb hoarding and speculation, the financial circles in this city have decided to strictly implement the "self-discipline system" of the financial circles. The first step of this "self-discipline system" is for each bank to automatically recover loans made in the last ten days. At the same time, the Banking and Money Industry Association has also decided that all association members are absolutely not allowed to engage in improper lending in the future.</p>
<p>It is learned that the banks that initially recovered loans are (1) the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, (2) the Bank of China, (3) the Bank of Communications, and (4) the Jincheng and other four banks. The targets of the recovery are (1) short-term credit loans and (2) goods mortgage loans. All other large and small banks and money shops have also begun to tighten their funds. It is reported that the loans recovered by the member banks and shops of the Banking and Money Industry Association in the past week have reached 100 million yuan, and the loans recovered by other non-member banks and shops have also reached more than 50 million yuan. It is also learned that the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association have decided on the following measures to assist the authorities in curbing hoarding:</p>
<p>(1) Except for the member shops of each industry association, any individuals or groups who mortgage goods to banks and money shops for loans will be rejected.</p>
<p>(2) All member banks and shops of the Banking and Money Industry Association are not allowed to concurrently operate commercial businesses.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of goods mortgage loans must be approved by the authorities and then by the Banking and Money Industry Association, and the company name, representative name, amount, loan period, and quantity of the guaranteed goods must be recorded in detail.</p>
<p>(4) For any member bank or shop of the Banking and Money Industry Association that violates the association's regulations, the association authorities will decide to expel it from membership and then request the authorities to punish it.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Harvest Delayed</h3>
<p>According to news from the silk industry, the harvest date of this year's spring cocoons will be postponed by four or five days due to the colder weather than in previous years, around the 20th of this month for silkworm cocoon production, and the end of the month could be harvested. Now it needs to be postponed to mid-May.</p>
<p>The Commercial Control Committee Plans to Purchase</p>
<p>Now that the new system of material movement is implemented, the transportation of silkworm cocoons can be unrestricted, so the silk industry in this city is actively carrying out the purchase of silk cocoons, and the larger scale ones are the China Silk Industry Company and the Central China Silk Industry Control Association, which are organized by the financial and silk industries in this city. It is reported that the Commercial Control Committee will plan various methods for purchasing silkworm cocoons in order to unify the purchase work.</p>
<p>The Harvest Can Reach More Than 100,000 Loads</p>
<p>It is also learned that the harvest of this year's spring cocoons can be expected to increase due to the high increase in silk prices and the increase in farmers raising silkworms. There are a total of 3 million silkworm seeds in the Central China region, of which 390,000 are Japanese species. There are 30,000 Japanese silkworm seeds and 600 Chinese silkworm seeds in the Eastern Zhejiang region. There are a total of 360,000 Japanese silkworm seeds in the Taihu area. It is estimated that the two places can harvest about more than 100,000 loads of spring cocoons.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Cigarette Distribution: Will Continue to Be Rationed</h3>

The goods distributed are the Axe, Quanlu, and Jinqiang brands of the Japanese China Tobacco Company, and the products of Huacheng Nan, and Xin Datong factories of Chinese merchants. The procedures for handling the delivery of goods have been completed, and the third phase of distribution will continue to be carried out immediately.

As of yesterday, a total of 3,000 loads have been received, and another 7,000 loads are being negotiated. After all of them are received, the office will once again sell them universally based on the house rent ticket and household certificate.</p>
<h3>The Circulation of the United Bank Notes in the Suhuai Area is Becoming More Consolidated</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 20th, Central News Agency: The circulation of the United Bank Notes in the Suhuai area has recently increased due to the influx of local products into the market. According to a recent survey, it has reached between 110 million and 150 million yuan. As for the remaining old currency, in terms of its purchasing power, it has long ceased to be a problem and is despised by the general public. Therefore, the status of the United Bank Notes in that area is now becoming more consolidated.</p>
<h3>Foil Taxed Ad Valorem</h3>
<p>The Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Foil Tax Chief of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to increase the tax on foil by doubling the estimated price, and to increase the tax on foil paper by 80% according to the past practice of increasing taxes. It is scheduled to be implemented today (21st). Yesterday, he specially ordered his subordinates to comply and notified all merchants and people to be aware of it.</p>
<h3>Readers' Forum: Advocating the Obligation to Rectify Newly Opened Banks</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Yinian</p>
<p>In recent years, the abnormal prosperity of newly opened banks in this city seems to be the rise of industry and commerce in this city on the surface, so a large number of financial institutions are urgently needed to supply and regulate them. Referring to the actual situation, there are indeed some newly opened banks that maintain normal banking business, but those who intend to seek profits and make "bank money" are also everywhere. Moreover, due to the unreasonable and abnormal nature of their business, some banks have been involved in a state of stagnant turnover or huge losses, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Due to my job, when checking the business situation and financial status of some newly opened banks, I found that there are many inaccuracies in the accounting records of these banks. The reason for this is nothing more than an attempt to conceal the truth of the business situation, or to obscure the awareness of ordinary shareholders and related parties. For example: it is heard that in a certain bank, the chairman and general manager are both nominal and have never been to the bank for a single day; its paid-in capital at the time of opening was only more than 1.1 million yuan, while the opening expenses included 440,000 yuan for the top fee of the bank address and 550,000 yuan for the cost of living and decoration, stationery, printing, etc. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is little left; its main business is to engage in group goods and buy and sell securities. In another bank, the number of internal office staff is almost equal to the number of customers under the demand deposit item. The business is sluggish and they play all day long. It is rumored that when the bank opened, anyone who subscribed to a certain number of shares could introduce one person to proceed, so the manager could not dismiss one person even if he wanted to; its only business is to buy, sell, or hoard various goods in the name of trust department customers, from Shuangma Lanfeng to Bagua Dan, light bulbs, and canned food, everything is available. In another bank, its branches are located everywhere, and its business is to hoard a large amount of cotton and wool fabrics. When the price of these cotton and wool fabrics is low, it is a loss to the bank, and when the price is high, it is a benefit to the bank's staff. And once there is a drastic financial change, the trust crisis of yesteryear will inevitably reappear, and they will all collapse. The government authorities should thoroughly correct them and merge them as soon as possible under stable conditions, so that the society and the people will benefit.</p>
<h3>Opinions of People Participating in the Commercial Control Committee</h3>
<p>Tobacco</p>
<p>Mr. Yongye Yusi Lang, the director of the tobacco department's preparation, is the president of the Central China Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd. The predecessor of the company was the Central China Cigarette Association, which has been responsible for the extremely difficult control of the purchase and distribution of cigarettes in Central China for three years.</p>
<p>The Central China Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd. has a complete organization and sound operation, which is sufficient to serve as a control institution. Regarding tobacco leaves, because the import of foreign tobacco leaves has been cut off, the only way is to strive to increase production. As for the production increase plan, the Central China Leaf Tobacco Company has already drafted a five-year production increase plan, starting from the 31st year and moving towards the planned increase budget. The results of the first year were quite good, about twice that of the 30th year.</p>
<p>In the past, a large amount of tobacco leaves were imported from Virginia in the United States, so the production of tobacco leaves was never considered. Now, due to the Great East Asia War, it has been cut off, so we are focusing on increasing the production of Fengyang American tobacco leaves to compensate, and have achieved unusually good results. Fengyang tobacco leaves are American species, so the quality is quite good, not inferior to pure Virginia products. Tobacco leaves are collected and assembled in various places in the past, and now they are being improved, and an improvement plan is being established. Since last year, American species have been distributed to farmers for sowing free of charge, and cultivation has been encouraged. Drying methods such as Lian Gan are also planned to be gradually popularized. For the improvement of tobacco leaves, the company dispatches Chinese and Japanese instructors to various places, and this year, it will also train instructors at the Mentai Zi Farm and recruit 20 graduates to cultivate them.</p>
<p>The consumption of tobacco leaves in Central China is slightly insufficient. After the completion of the first five-year plan, the Central China part can be self-sufficient. After the first plan, it is planned to continue the second five-year plan. After the completion of the second five-year plan, Central China will not be a problem, and it can also supply Japan. Regardless of the organizational form of the tobacco department, which is the lower-level organization of the Control General Association, it is believed that this plan is absolutely necessary. In the past, tobacco leaf seeds were supplied by Japan. Since last year, three farms have been established to establish a seed collection plan. This year, they can be gradually collected. Use this seed to improve the soil leaves. The land in Central China that can be used to grow tobacco leaves will gradually be distributed with this seed. Fengyang American tobacco leaves are gradually being improved, and the original tobacco leaves are also hoped to be improved, and can be richly supplied with good quality tobacco leaves. In the past, because of the import of Virginia tobacco leaves, it implicitly occupied a monopoly position. This phenomenon should no longer exist in the future, and the production of tobacco leaves that are not inferior should be greatly increased. Therefore, not only in terms of cultivation, but also the first drying method adopted by farmers in the past must be improved. Considerable attention must be paid to both cultivation and drying. At the same time, if it cannot be subsidized, it will be difficult to have the expected progress. Therefore, in the current situation, various difficult problems arise. Only increasing production is an absolute requirement, and it must be completed first no matter what.</p>
<p>Central China has now taken various necessary measures, and a powerful institution has been established with Chinese and Japanese cooperation. The current urgent task should be to first establish the foundation of tobacco leaf raw materials in Central China and conduct research. As for the institution, both the upper and lower levels cannot but be jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese people.</p>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Co., Ltd. has grown up hard from the war, and its fruits have benefited the Chinese as well. Therefore, in the future, it can become a powerful institution and book it for operation due to the joint venture between China and Japan.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p>— Prisoner</p>
<p>It's strange, what people remember the most is "me," and what they forget the fastest is also "me."</p>
<p>When a thing is deemed a success, everyone hopes most to bring out "me," and even hopes that someone will cheer and explain that this success is entirely due to "me"'s credit, although this success is truly due to "cooperation" or is accidental and unexpected.</p>
<p>What if things fail? The first to hide or evade responsibility is "me," or the one who publishes a statement in the newspaper saying "it has nothing to do with me" is "me," who is the worst? Of course not "me"!</p>
<p>When I suffer, it seems the whole world should shed tears of sympathy! When someone other than "me" suffers, just a smile is enough.</p>
<p>But what exactly is "me"? Is it a cod liver oil pill! Right? Is it the essence of the "greater self" (!?) Is it the pride of heaven! Great is "me"!</p>
<h3>Arguing</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Among my colleagues, I often see a few who often stubbornly insist on their own prejudices for an extremely small matter, and "argue" with each other with red faces and necks, without giving in.</p>
<p>They all truly have amazing self-confidence, although they may sometimes realize their mistakes, but; because they trust themselves too much, or think that "admitting mistakes" is a matter of great loss of face, they would rather "argue" until they are hoarse and exhausted, and never want to "admit mistakes" and be done with it.</p>
<p>I have also several times acted as a peacemaker, mediating between them, but, after getting to the bottom of it, I realized that the cause was so small, and even had absolutely no significant relationship to themselves, like: "arguing" about whether a certain woman is beautiful or not, will rice fall from the sky? ...and so on, I have never heard them "argue" about academic views, or which country Tolstoy is from? Who wrote the Theory of Evolution? Is air colored or colorless? ...</p>
<p>I really admire them for having this free time, and this much surplus energy, to make such unnecessary consumption for these meaningless questions.</p>
<p>However, the focus of their "argument" is not completely focused on the obvious center of the cause. The focus of their blushing and hoarse "argument" is still based on each person's self-confidence -- everyone trusts themselves too much.</p>
<p>People should have tenacious self-confidence, but, if they trust themselves too much, and do not judge the right and wrong of a thing, and stubbornly insist on their own prejudices to make arbitrary decisions, this is not pure self-confidence, but a kind of domineering self-righteousness.</p>
<p>There are too many people of this kind.</p>
<p>"Arguing" is definitely not absolutely undesirable. I remember that in the student days, the school often held debates, allowing us to "argue" based on our own views, this kind of "argument" may indeed give us a lot of help in knowledge. But, those unnecessary and meaningless "arguments", I think can be extinguished.</p>
<h3>Sketch in the Car: Original Nature</h3>
<p>— Yang Sai</p>
<p>When the trolley was running, two people were still dangling outside the car door.</p>
<p>"People inside, make way! We're going to fall!" The two shouted in unison. The people inside were all safe, and they were no longer afraid of falling. They were all talking and laughing leisurely.</p>
<p>"We're going to fall! We're going to fall!"</p>
<p>As a result, after they really fell, the people inside only made way a little bit, and said in unison:</p>
<p>"These two people are really careless. If there is a place, they don't come up. Now they have caused trouble, and they can't blame others!"</p>
<p>When the tram was crowded, a woman squeezed in, carrying many fruit boxes and paper bags, followed by a maid and a small girl, holding a child.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's so crowded!" the woman sighed.</p>
<p>"Please come this way!" A passenger gave up a seat.</p>
<p>"Come here!" Another passenger.</p>
<p>The woman sat down and put things on a vacant spot by her side.</p>
<p>"It's so crowded!" the woman said again.</p>
<p>It was crowded again, and the ticket seller shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Please come in! Please come in!"</p>
<p>Passengers squeezed inside desperately, and the car, the platform, and the steps were full of people.</p>
<p>"There's no way during office hours! Please forgive me and squeeze a little more!"</p>
<p>At a station, many people squeezed down, and the ticket seller collected a lot of money.</p>
<p>Many people came up.</p>
<p>"Squeeze in tight, let a few more come up, so it's easier for everyone!"</p>
<p>After one station, he collected a lot of money again.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Si's Expedient</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The current standard of living is so high, and my life is so difficult. Therefore, ordinary people save where they can, and give up what they can't use. At the same time, new tricks for waste utilization and renovation have emerged. My small contribution can also be said to be one of them.</p>
<p>Razor blades are so necessary for men with beards that they can hardly do without them for a day. It is said that old-brand razor blades sell for a lot of money, and even ordinary ones cost two or three yuan. Suppose a razor blade can be used for a month, and each blade is calculated at two yuan, it will cost twenty-four yuan a year. Although it is nothing to an individual, it is considerable when multiplied by the entire population of Shanghai. Assuming that Shanghai has four million people, excluding women, children, and those without beards, at least 500,000 people need razor blades. If each person uses one blade per month as calculated above, then it will cost tens of millions of yuan a year. Isn't this a shocking amount of money?</p>
<p>Now there is a way to turn dull razor blades into new ones. Not only has it been tested, but it is also very effective. That is, first put the razor blade into boiling water for about five or six minutes, then take it out and place it on a glass plate (such as a mirror, glass, bottle, etc.), and sharpen it diagonally like sharpening scissors. Sharpen the four edges on both sides of the razor blade for one or two minutes, and it will be like a newly sharpened one. When it becomes dull, it can be sharpened again, so a razor blade can be used for at least half a year or a year. I think this method, except for the razor blade merchants who will be unhappy and unsympathetic, Mr. Yu Si will definitely be happy to adopt. I am thinking for the general public, so I can't worry about so much.</p>
<p>If we follow my method and use a razor blade for half a year, then one person can save twenty yuan a year, and 500,000 people can save ten million yuan, right? If this ten million yuan is used for charity, I wonder how many people can be saved? How many ambitious young people can be cultivated?</p>
<h3>### Tenth Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read Books? What Books to Read?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jingyun</p>
<p>In the past, there were three "arrivals" in the art of reading, but I think it's not enough, and one more arrival is needed, for a total of four arrivals: mouth arrival, eye arrival, heart arrival, and hand arrival.</p>
<p>Mouth arrival, what the ancients called mouth arrival, is to be able to memorize an article thoroughly. Although no one advocates memorizing books now, if we encounter poems and wonderful articles, we should always read them carefully and memorize them.</p>
<p>Eye arrival, is to recognize every word. Every dot and stroke of Chinese characters, and the ABCD of foreigners, cannot be ambiguous, and none can be missed. This seems very easy, but many Chinese people make this mistake. I remember someone translating English, mistaking "port" for "pork," so wine turned into pork. Isn't this because the eye didn't arrive?</p>
<p>Heart arrival, is to understand the meaning of every sentence and every word. To achieve this, there are three conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Reference books—such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. The Analects says: "If a workman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." When we read books, the first thing is to have complete tools.</p>
<p>(2) Do grammatical analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Sometimes it is necessary to compare references and integrate them.</p>
<p>Zhang Zai of the Song Dynasty said: "When reading, you must first know how to doubt." "To doubt where there is no doubt is progress." Father said: "Those who can doubt but doubt little have not learned; if they learn, they must doubt. Learning values understanding, and preserving the old has merit."… etc. Aren't these a few very important sentences about heart arrival?</p>
<p>Hand arrival: (1) Punctuate and divide into paragraphs,</p>
<p>(2) Take notes and add lines.</p>
<p>Reading also requires a calm mind, and then opening the book will be beneficial. If there are places with unclear meaning, look at the annotations if there are any, and if there are no annotations, think carefully and you will naturally understand. This is how progress is made. Chen Lie used to have a bad memory. One day, he read Mencius' "The way to serve and inquire is nothing else, but to seek to let go of one's heart." He suddenly realized and said: "My heart has never been restrained, why can I remember the book." So he closed the door and sat quietly, reading for more than a hundred days, in order to let go of his heart.</p>
<p>What books should we read? Regarding this question, I think "broad" is the best. Why should we be broad? (1) Breadth is for reference, (2) Breadth is for being a person.</p>
<p>Breadth is for reference -- Wang Anshi said in his reply to Zeng Zigust: "...If you only read the classics, you will not know the classics..." If we extend this, it becomes "If you only read one book, you will not understand that book." For example, if we want to read the Book of Poetry, if we first study a little sociology, philology, phonology, archeology...etc.; then reading the Book of Poetry will be much more understandable.</p>
<p>Darwin spent more than thirty years studying the state of biological evolution, accumulating a lot of material, but he couldn't think of a simple answer. He accidentally read Malthus's "Essay on the Principle of Population" and suddenly realized the principle of biological evolution.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should read more books, no matter what books we read. Often, a very ordinary book contains a great hint. To summarize it in one sentence, it is what Wang Anshi called: "Attain knowledge and then read."</p>
<p>Breadth is for being a person -- A person who is as isolated as a flagpole with only one skill is certainly not good. A person who seems to know everything but is not good at anything, like a piece of paper, looks big but has no substance, is also not good. Our ideal reader is both proficient and broad, like a pyramid, big, tall, and sharp.</p>

The clinic is open from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning, and those who live far away are not limited. (2) Zhang Xiangwen, the director of Renhe Hospital, sent a letter donating ten outpatient preferential coupons and ten delivery preferential coupons each, entrusting this newspaper to give them to elementary school teachers, limited to one per person. (3) Youzhu Hospital has created a method of consulting about illnesses through correspondence, which is completely service-oriented. Patients can list their name, age, place of origin, marital status, occupation, detailed address, and the course of the illness, the time of onset, past medical history, current condition, medical history, and points of doubt, and send them to the hospital at No. 129, Rue des Soeurs, French Concession, and they will receive a reply. Face-to-face inquiries about the illness are held every Saturday afternoon from 4:00 to 5:00 or Sunday morning from 9:00 to 11:00.</p>
<h3>### Rescued Orphan: Donations to Help Street Children</h3>
<p>I am an orphan who has been wandering for a long time and relying on the relief of enthusiastic people in the society. I have been transferred to orphanages and orphanages for several times. Last summer, when the beggar shelter was disbanded, I was unfortunately among those disbanded. Thinking of the panic of the future, thinking of the small life, how dangerous and sad it was! When the sun set, I was still sitting on the side of the road crying faintly. I thought my life would not be long. Unexpectedly, there is always a way out, and the enthusiastic philanthropists Rong Boyun and Layman Hu Yang appeared, they pitied my suffering and helplessness, and took me in to serve in the Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association. From then on, I had a way to make a living. Last month, I was asked by Minister Ye to help for a few days and received a reward of forty yuan. Now, Layman Hu has introduced me to the Shengsheng Farm in Pudong to be an apprentice, which has stabilized my lifelong happiness. In addition to being grateful in my heart, I also think of countless orphans who are crying and waiting to be rescued. Therefore, I am not stingy to donate a quarter of the two hundred yuan I have earned from working for a year, a total of fifty yuan, and ask your newspaper to distribute it to orphanages or beggar shelters. Although it is a drop in the bucket, I hope that we orphans, after getting a little light, can take out part of our salary to engage in relief work, to save people as those who have been saved, to comfort the enthusiastic people in society, and to encourage and persuade people in society to donate generously. Sincerely, Li Yunjing, a wandering orphan. (Editor's note: It has been sent to the Fuyouyuan, which cares for orphans and street children.)</p>
