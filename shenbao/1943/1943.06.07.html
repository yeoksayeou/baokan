<p>社評</p>
<h3>木無聲的歐洲</h3>
<p>歐洲的戰局，從地中海到德蘇戰塲，嚴格的說，陸上戰爭已陷於停滯狀態，僅有劇烈的空戰，打破這暴風雨前的沉寂。但是，無論如何，沉寂的日子不會太久的，「萬木無聲等雨來」，今日歐洲人也許都已具有這種嚴肅的心理吧？</p>
<p>然而，歐洲局勢的演變，却正在這暫時的沉寂之中忙亂着。在政治上，在動員工作上，雙方進行着非常劇烈的戰鬥。而這種非軍車的戰鬥，將是未來戰局的極關重要的決定力量。</p>
<p>自從羅斯福邱吉爾最近一次會談結束以後，雖然反軸心國的「進攻歐陸」的宣傳囂然塵上，可是，實際上還是神經戰的開始，他們如果有所謂攻勢的話，那也只是政治上的活動而已。最値得注意的是上月二十二日共產國際之宣吿解散，這是在於緩和英美蘇聯問之矛盾，並且企圖在歐洲各小國與中立國間消泯對赤禍的畏懼心理，而興反軸心國接近。這些，本來只是一部份人的判斷，現在史太林以答覆路透社記者問題的四點，巳自動加以揭穿了。但是，這不過是一方面的企圖，結果如何，還很難說，羅斯福特使載維斯已竇史太林的覆書返美，大槪英美蘇間的話題還多着哩。</p>
<p>其次，可以表現反軸心國之新活動的，是促成法國分裂派，即「戰鬥法國」派（接近英國的）戴高樂，和繼　將達蘭而竊據法屬西北非洲（接近美國的）季勞特雙方的妥協。戴季兩人日前訶爾及爾之會議，在英美的合力策動之下，業已成立所謂「法國民族解放委員會」，作爲法國反軸心派的中央政權機構，這是美國支持下的季勞特的讓步。但同時，戴高樂也犧牲了原有的「戰鬥法國」的若干機構，併入「民族解放委員會」，戴季雙方並以這個委昌會的名義，宣言堅持「復國」戰爭，甘爲英美所驅使。這似乎是英美另一幕得意的傀儡劇當常然，大家「同床異夢」，前途並不足重視，不過，可注意的是從此已有亞歷山大和阿爾及利亞方面的法國艦隊，包括無畏艦一艘，一萬噸的巡洋艦三艘，七千噸的巡洋艦一艘，魚雷艦若干艘，編入了敵方英美的陣營。這是爲每一法國人所重視的。</p>
<p>再次，是對中立國伸展陰謀的魔手，主要的，除了外交。經濟的陰謀之外，還會策動政變，掀起所謂「革命」的事件。昨天報載，南美洲僅有的一個中立國，一向力排美國的慫患威脅而繼續與軸心國保持正常國交和貿易的中立大國—阿根廷，竟在美國的策動之下，於本月四日發生所謂「革命」，由親美派的國防部長拉米雷茲將軍，　脅了阿根廷若干軍團及重要軍官多納茲將軍與羅森將軍等，逼迫阿總統卡斯蒂洛承認四項要求：（一）變更中立政策，（二）美洲各國協力，（三）選舉自由，（四）整飭政治。很顯然的，所有道些，正是美國一向所求於阿國而不得的，現在叛黨已成立革命政府，瑞典京城五日電更稱：「阿國行將加入反軸心國陣營，而與軸心國絕交，加入戰爭。」我們在這裏應該繁戒，英美的第五縱隊，同時也可能在歐洲乃至近東各國出現，而所謂「第二達蘭」也正在蠢動着。</p>
<p>在戰略方面，邱吉爾曾赴直布羅陀，並曾在阿爾及爾與突尼斯，與北非美聯軍總司令艾森霍華，以及英第八軍長蒙高茂來，第一軍長亞力山大，以及法方的季羅特。戴高樂等舉行會議，當然，對於未來的戰略與戰術，有所策動與討論。而在軍事方面，所謂「空中攻勢」，幾乎已經在作進一步的大規模的展開了。然而，是不是由上述這秤種事態，就可以推論到英美已經有實力向歐洲發動攻勢呢？在我們看來，英美還在躊躇着，正如四日中央社里斯本電（見五日各報）華盛頓日報軍事記者斯哥柏氏所自供，反軸心國當前有八大難題，急須解決，即（一）蘇聯陣綫問題。他說這是最大的陸戰塲，包括大部份的空戰力量，迫急需要英美物資的接濟；（二）歐西問題，包括進攻歐陸及海陸空軍力量之聯合運用；（三）轟炸德義，包括設立龐大空軍，與海陸空軍切實合作；（四）對付潛艇威脅，包括强有力之戰鬥機興飛機的利用；（五）太平洋戰塲，日本海軍實力强大，這問題也急待決定；（六）重慶的戰鬥力必須使之活躍，而重慶較之蘇聯，戰時生產量更少，受傷也更大；（七）日本在佔領地把持日久，則愈難擊敗；（八）在日本本國遭受反軸心軍森炸與大砲砲彈及反軸心軍之　蹄蹂躪以前，太平洋戰爭不能認爲得勝。斯哥伯所指出的八點，正是反軸心軍當前最無法解答，而也正是軸心軍保持優勢的地方。</p>
<p>相反的，在軸心國方面，面對着世界戰爭的最嚴重的局面，却保持着沉着平靜與嚴肅，實在在軸心國，到了今天，絕對用不着叫　宣傳，用不着一連串的大小會議，更用不着進行神經戰的行動了。在目前和未來的戰爭中，決定勝利的力量，主要的是：第一，地中海及至西歐的制空權之保持，以義大利在地中海之地理的優勢，和德義軍在法國南部的防衛措置之鞏固，南部的戰塲，用不到顯慮。至於西歐和北歐，英美如果要登陸，那在數百哩以至千哩的戰綫，集中陸海空軍的全力，這在三島這小小根據地，加以軸心潛艦作戰之威力，是很少可以支持深入後的接濟的，何况英國本國的補給力有限，而美國還遠隔着大西洋。第二，決定未來戰爭的主要戰塲，還在東綫德蘇戰塲。顯然最近幾個月來，雙方都　準備着，可是，道種準備的目標顯然有着區別，在蘇聯方面，與其謂爲準備攻擊，毋寗說是準備防禦，他們最好是拖延時間，拖過夏天和秋天，延到冬天，那時，他們積半年以上的準備，利用天時地利，或者會發動攻勢而求勝利。但是，顯然的，德國是不會那樣放任蘇聯打如意算盤的，在德國，直到今日，對於東綫的重視，一直超過其他各綫，而及時展開夏季攻勢，可說是佔有第一等地位的。經過了相當悠長的沉寂之後，德國再不會容許蘇聯從容的準備了。現在，古班地區的慘烈的空中戰已經開始，夏季一天逼近一天，德軍的大規模的攻勢，是不能再等待多久了。第三，歐洲各小國的態度，特別是各中立國的態度，這裏主要的還要包括土耳其在內，對於未來戰局自有決定性的影響。土耳其的曖昧，能保持的日子一天天的短促了，西班牙在其和平的提議遭到反擊以來，已經準備戰火來襲時的行動，東南的巴爾幹半島，東北的斯坎的那維亞半島，以及順着大西洋海岸諸國，都已準備着反侵略的血戰。而第四，反軸心國內部，特別是美國內部，以煤礦工人之總同盟罷工開始，正沸騰着由物價高漲所激起的反政府與動亂的波濤，從軍火生產事業各部門以至行政部門，都遭遇着危機。加以美國在太平洋上，又不斷地遭受着嚴重的打擊，所有這些，牽制着他們第二步的行動；同時也就給軸心國以進一步反擊的機會。</p>
<p>歐洲，正處在決戰的前夜，動心軍以平靜和嚴肅的心情，以逸待勞，準備着勝利的迎頭痛擊。</p>
<h3>暴風雨前夕的莫斯科景象</h3>
<p>— 日本朝日新聞社莫斯科畑中特派員六月一日特電</p>
<p>記者滯留莫斯科一月，於今日起程往庫比希夫，在此一月間，未來的德蘇夏季大戰將演出的地區，平靜無戰事，僅在南部地區，德空軍反復轟炸鐵道聯絡綫及戰時的要衝。記者在莫斯科的滯留中，不僅未聞一次空襲警報，簡直不覺得有直接威脅市民和平生活的戰爭存在着。在我們的記憶中，前年的通到莫斯科的道路，密佈着戰車壕及堡壘，防衛首都，當時的情形，尙歷歷如在目前，可是今日舊地重遊，那時的戰車壕及堡壘，完全變成了市民的農園，殊出意外。</p>
<p>這市民農園的普及，成爲目前莫斯科的重要問題，當局正在計劃促進個人或團體開闢此種農園。現在莫斯科的市民正在把從郊外通至市中的道路及市街分闢爲農園用土地從事耕作。這市民農園的營運，莫斯科伊維寗格報答覆市民的幼稚的質問。譬如像「馬鈴薯幾時可下種？」「在雨天不能下種麽？」「種植馬鈴薯的中間隙地，可利用作別的用途麽？」等等外行園藝家的質問。關於園藝著作的單行本和小冊子，在書店前列隊爭購。市內到處可見的這市民農園，大小合計據說數目在三高三千二百四十九所之上，像果里基街那樣觸目的高層建築物的四周都闢成農國。這是因爲市民在過去三個冬季中苦於野菜的缺乏，故開始這種活動，以求自給自足。</p>
<p>莫斯科市民的另一苦悶是柴薪的不足。現在莫斯科的街頭，裝載着木材的電車和汽車的往來，觸目皆是，可知他們正在未雨綢繆，以備來冬之需。市內和郊外的交通被嚴厲地統制着，居住於郊外別墅中的市民，入城時亦須特別許可。地下鐵道的行駛時間至午後七時半止。十二時以後禁止一般通行，興以前無異。劇塲大部分在午後十一時打烊，公園至十時半停止開放。開戰起初幾個月莫斯科所見的指示炸彈避所的標識，現在變成防毒室的指標，劇塲的壁上，寫着：「空襲警報發令的塲合，立即中止公演，觀衆各自到就近的防毒室或地下鐵道車站避難。」這吿示證明莫斯科尙處於德機之不新的空襲下。準備德機來襲的防空陣勢，毫不懈怠，繼續緊張地警戒着，晚竊迷茫的空中，阻隔汽球靜悠悠地浮漾着。德蘇戰爭表現在莫斯科的景象正是大風雨前夕的平靜。（翔：譯自六月三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>渝軍魯南總指揮　榮子恒率部歸順　發表聲明脫離渝方參加和運　於學忠魯南根據地將全喪失</h3>

<p>法領事辭</p>

<h3>中滿泰駐日武官　發表視察南方感想</h3>
<p>昭南六日中央社電　中滿泰三國駐日武官組織之南方視察團一行，上月三十一日由昭南啓程前往蘇門答臘·爪哇·各地視察。五日下午三時乘機返抵昭南，旋在旅邸分別發表此次視察感想。中國鄭中將談稱：「予於爪哇之首次感觸即日軍之神速行動，僅二週間使此廣大土地之敵軍降伏，又目覩爪哇日軍將士之精勤工作，爲之欽佩不已。」滿洲國劉尙將官稱：「予在蘇門答臘途經棉蘭巴鄰旁間公路，感日軍戰果之偉大，目覩更勝耳聞也，當地住民之安居樂業情形，正與現在滿洲國無異，而居民之積極協力日軍，尤足看出彼等之愛敬日本心情。泰國丘泰克少將談稱：「視察團在各地備受歡迎，非常感激，予等曾視察數處戰蹟及聽聞戰况，益證明日軍之堅强及訓練之優秀，爪哇物資人口均冠於南方各地，現在住民早巳安居樂業，治安亦已確立，不愧爲共榮圈之樂園也」。</p>
<p>萬隆六日中央社電　視察南方之中滿泰三國駐日武官一行，於二日到達瓜加爾達。三日晨乘汽車赴加里卡基林邨視察戰蹟，並參拜日軍勇士墓後，至萬隆市參觀市內外一切設施，並由見山州長說明加拉州之軍政現况，旋參觀沽哥爾市之植物園，又一行於四日下午乘機飛至泗水，旋即訓問當地陸海軍當局。晚間出席陸軍部隊主辦之招待宴，五日上午搭機飛赴某地。</p>
<h3>谷大使　返國發表談話</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　駐華日大使谷正之氏爲述職返四，於五日下午二時抵福岡，發表談話如次：此次日方實施對華新政策，而交還租界撤廢治外法權等後，頗引起中國方面良好影響。余此次返國前，曾往華北及華中視察，目覩各地中國民衆對於日方實施新政策均甚重視，而努力於職守頗爲欣慰。蓋新政策不僅祗限於交還租界撤廢治外法權，在經濟民生等方面亦合有援助中國復興之重大意義。故此項工作現僅爲端緒而已，山本元帥之殉四，汪主席及中國民衆均深信大東亞戰爭因此種精神，始能期獲勝利，並抱絕大勇氣，以貫澈戰爭之勝利。</p>
<h3>南方各地　經濟建設槪況　積極開發資源努力生產　表現東方民族團結精神</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞共榮圈內開發資源及增强戰力等經濟建設，巳早獲得偉大成果，共榮圈內戰略態勢之堅固基礎亦已奠定。當此敵方高呼反攻之際，大東亞之建設工作，進行亦愈趨積極。茲綜合南方各地最近建設狀况介紹如次：</p>
<p>菲列賓　菲島人民因日東條首相及靑木大東亞相等相繼來訪，咸益增菲島獨立之望，並對日政府協助菲島獨立之眞摯熱意，更有深切瞭解，故其與日協力之意志亦益昂揚。菲行政當局認確立菲島經濟自給自足，實爲菲島獨立之最要條件，故前已實施糧食五年計劃，並在各州政府及菲島奉仕團等協力下，在各地召開糧食增產協譏會，獲得偉果。同時又擴充米穀採購機構及整備配給機構等，亦均大有進展，並已確立糧食以外之生活必需品自給計劃，如利用當地出產之棉花苧麻馬尼拉麻及其他織維品，以增產衣料之計劃，現已進行設立此項生產設備。此外復增設各種輕工業工廠，如造紙火柴肥皂蘇打電氣器具味精廠等，自此菲島經濟自給體制，業已步入正軌而得日益發展。</p>
<p>馬來　馬來方面根據確立自給體制之基本方針，着手實施增產糧食·强化工業生產·及調整橡皮工業等。關於糧食增產，除謀增加米之生產外，並謀增產苧·玉蜀黍等雜糧，在各農事試騐塲所試植之台灣產蓬萊米，已獲得成功。當局並計劃自爪哇方面輸入雜糧等，現正考慮自緬甸輸入米以資調劑。關於橡皮，此次日軍於馬來及蘇門答臘兩地，共沒收敵產橡園約一百七十萬英畝，以其中百分之四十，分別委託民間經營，其餘百分之六十，則由軍政監部直接管轄，以暫停生產爲原則。但因橡皮爲原住民生活之源，故預定收買其相當數量以資救濟。同時因改植他物而失業之原住民，在馬來方面約有六十二萬人，當局對此決以其中百分之五六十，改爲從事增產糧食或建立事業，因此一方面已調整人力問題，同時糧食增產亦得有急速進展。</p>
<p>爪哇　爪哇全島農園及交通機關，已將悉復舊觀。當局爲期適應情勢，特於栽培企業管理公園中設立轉換部，拳管農產轉換生產事宜。對於目前生產過剩物資，如茶，咖啡，橡皮，絲，棉樹等，將檢討將圈內及其他方面需要狀況，分別作局部處理。如將茶園改植金鷄納霜，洋槐，苧蔴等，及一部咖啡園栽培可可（狄利斯，熱帶植物名）除虫菊等殺生劑原料植物。此外增產棉花已獲成效，而爪哇之金鷄納霜，原佔世界產額百分之九十八，刻亦在積極增產中。又當局並爲謀從速增加日籍技術專家，故於五月二十日在波哥爾州設立日籍技術人員養成所。且爪哇方面亦與蘇門答臘相似，農國工人失業者已悉分別使其轉業，且進行頗爲順利，此實爲當局施政之一大成功。上述南方各地之經濟狀况，僅爲大槪情形，反軸心方面雖均認日本動員共榮圈物資增加戰力，但皆忽視大東亞民族精神方面之團結。蓋共榮圈內各民族已無分彼此，對於此次戰爭之眞意，皆巳有深切理解，故均努力克服任何困難，共爭取東亞民族之獨立自由而奮鬥。南方經濟建設在原住民之協力下，順利進展，足可爲最好之證明，此實爲反軸心國方面所應特別認識者。</p>
<p>瓜加爾達六日中央社電　此間軍政監部爲復興爪哇之唐業，決定設立糖業公會。五日已發出布吿：此次設立糖業公會之目的，爲謀爪哇製糖業之健全發展，而將製糖業及其所附帶事業之工塲農園設施及其生產品加以管理，然規定之生產計劃，栽培藉以促進糖業及以糖業作基礎之新工業，期使爪哇成爲共榮圈內之砂糖最大產區。</p>
<p>西里伯　東京六日中央社電　據台北電話：西里伯日海軍民政府總監岡田文秀此次爲向中央請示機宜於日昨乘機返國，於四日道經此間，據談，西里伯及南婆羅洲之建設現况稱，西里伯應首先着手之工作，即爲開發礦業與近代工業之基礎。最近鐵錫鎳等之增產進行極爲順利，鍊織廠所必需之煤之蘊藏量亦極豐富，故欲與當地之鍊鋼工業，非諜輕工業之發達不可。至於今年棉花之產量，因指導得法，與當地居民之協力，預料亦必佳，紡織工廠近有設置之可能。以言稻米，以西里伯及婆羅洲地方地質並不肥沃故選擇適當之稻種，並謀肥料之自給自足，以資加强生產。在舊荷印時代，椰子之生產相當可觀，現擬取椰子油以充食用，肥皂工廠亦計劃設立中。當局並擬在民政府中，添設一綜合硏究所，求近代科學方法開發當地。總之，西里伯及婆羅洲兩地一切建設工作，因得當地居民之熱誠協助，其進行極爲順利。</p>
<h3>史比爾敎授闡述　德軍火生產現狀</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國軍火部長斯比爾敎授昨在此間國社黨羣衆大會發表演說，透露德國軍備與彈藥產量之準確數字。謂自一九四二年以來，軍火之產量已經倍增，達到新紀錄之數字。且因未來生產程序之結果，更將有超過之可能。自一九四二年春間，重坦車各式高射砲及他種軍火，如水雷及飛機等，均已大見增加，抵抗坦克車軍火之產業已增加十倍，三·七種口徑以上之大砲產量增加百分之四百，高射砲之產量增加三倍，而德國最著各之平射砲，則亦增加百分之二百。去年會發明新式飛機多種，均已加入德空軍作戰，計飛機之總產量已較上年增加數倍。至於原料方面之形勢，所有煤鐵及鋼之產量，均已有鉅大增加，而鋁鎂鉻錳及其他金屬亦均足敷應用。德國之軍備工業，幸經事前深謀遠慮之疏散，比較可不懼空中之襲擊，德國之生產力量常在增加中。德方之運輸形勢十分美滿，現更從事建造新機車，以謀繼續改進。以木表及其他代用品替代汽油，其節省燃料之功效，等於設立若干大規模人造汽油之工廠。軍備工業所僱用工人之數，一年之內已增加百分之二三，該業彼此間之交換生產經騐，使人力與物質方面節省不少。最近英機空襲所炸毀之兩處水閘，並不影饗軍火之生產，魯爾流域之水量供給，祗不過暫時略受妨害而已。今後德國軍備工業將續添工人，並已設立新廠，縱事軍火之大量生產。况德人之發明天才，對於各項新式武器創造與舊式軍火之改進，均在不斷硏究中。</p>
<h3>美軍傷亡數字</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電</p>
<p>據華盛頓消息：美陸海兩部上週報吿美軍另外傷亡數字二二七一名。陸軍部報吿者計一二九九名，計傷者二五一名，失蹤者一七九名，被俘者八六九名，海軍部公布者計死者二十一人，傷一二人失蹤四十八人。</p>
<h3>英駐敎廷使者　延期返任</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡六日中央社　海通社昨日獲悉：英國駐敎廷使者奧斯本爵士，下週內不能返至梵蒂岡，渠已通知其此間之秘書，謂須再度展期十日始能返任。</p>

<h3>貝當發表談話　闡明法國態度　堅持中立致力國家復興　履行協定續以勞工供應</h3>
<p>巴黎六日中央社電　貝當元首四日接見小巴黎人報記者時，再度闡明法國之態度，謂「余決始終擔負復興法國之重任，不爲任何演變所左右，目前法國人民唯一要務，即在忠實履行法國之旣定國策，法國刻正擔負救濟世界忽視此項事實及企圖，而將責任委諸他國。關於最近英美空軍之盲炸法國各都市，對非交戰國之無辜人民濫施轟炸，此實爲非人道之行爲」云。按貝當元首此項聲明，實可視爲再度確認法政府不論北非之如何策動，決仍立於軸心方面，堅持中立方針。</p>
<p>維希六日中央社電　法首長賴伐爾於五日晚向法國全境發表廣播，指出法國當前所遭之危機，力言法國國民應始終與軸心方面協力，爲復興祖國而努力。其大意謂：法國政府決不稍有變更德義兩國之友好關係，今後目將加倍與兩國合作，努力確保在歐洲之適當地位。至此次戰爭係反對與德義維持友好關係等輩所引起，現德義兩國正爲打倒共產主義而流血，法國則以供給勞工以爲協助。最近德法兩國已成立一種協定，規定自四月一日起至七月一日止，法國以二十五萬工人供給德車，其係余會晤德元首希特勒之結果，決定法國更積極以勞力供給德國。今爲應付此項情勢起見，決定徵用一九四三年之全部壯丁，如有規避徵用，政府決依法嚴懲。在德國國內工人與法工人受同等待遇，彼等已爲恢復祖國而盡其應盡之義務，願我國人一致奮起，則祖國之復興必有希望云。</p>
<h3>科學勝利之聲（一）</h3>
<p>戰爭的勝利，即科學的勝利。熱心科學，已經普遍到了前綫與後方。我國科學界自從大東亞戰爭以來，對於各種武器和飛機，都曾有空前驚人的長足發展。然戰鬥的形態愈深刻，耳目所不能睹的科學與科學之戰鬥亦愈激烈。爲使大東亞戰爭取得勝利，這不僅需要戰鬥，而更需要科學戰以擊破英美，使其無條件的懾服。科學的勝利是非常壯觀的。但這決不是一日之或可以取得。而是不分晝夜，絞膿榨汁，廢寢忘食，長年孜孜研究的血汁結晶，於是方能戰勝。現在我們就要講出一些科學界的人物所已經獲得研究的成果，以資明日科學振興的參考。我們先看一下日本學術振興會十週年紀念大講演會所發表的科學家之辛苦研究。</p>
<h3>日本稻各遍全東亞　不怕過熱與病害蟲</h3>
<p>東亞共榮圈內十萬萬民族與其主要食糧稻米，是有絕對不可分離的密切關係。米，只有米才是東亞民族的力之源朱，也才是東亞民族的生命原素。也只有米才能培養担負明天共榮圈的人們之基本生命力。然而一般說來，米是有其五花八門的種類的，其性能與形態也是千差萬別的。但這無數品種之中指導東亞的農作稻業者，是日本的稻米，日本種無論在科學方面和實際方面，都有出類拔萃的性能，在收獲上則超過南方種數倍，而藉日本種與南方種合配而形成的耐熱性與耐蟲性之新日本品種，輸送到南方各地，使東亞共榮圈的米源源不絕地增產，於是方能絕對確保增强戰力的食糧問題。以東亞全土的稻米爲對象而從事科學的研究，在將來必須日益發展。前曾發見稱雄世界的陸羽一三二號稻，對日本食糧問題曾有莫大供獻。五榖界權威，農林省農事試騐塲塲長兼東京帝國大學農學研究所所長寺尾博農學博士，近著「稻與大東亞共榮團」，現在我們少微看一下。</p>
<p>大東亞共榮團在民族關係，風土，氣候，產業等方面，比較其他區域都有其特色，然而特色最大者，莫如稻。稻作佔全世界之大部份，都在東亞地域。而東亞十萬萬民族都靠米這種主要食糧而生存。東亞人民與稻共繁榮，共成長。這一點是人所共知的。但在大東亞團中雖然有泰國，緬甸，安南等大輸出國，但非輸出國也有。在戰時的今天，東亞各地域必須在米上自足自給，這是不待言的。雖然順便說一句增產，實際上要賦與技術和科學方面以極大的困難代價。用什麼品種來塡補其困難？何種品種最適合於南方？那一品種收獲多而具有耐虫性和耐熱性？這都在研究東亞圈內稻米方面的必要對象。</p>
<p>對於日本人，一談到「稻」則一定在腦海中浮現出日本的稻米，然而在稻米中，有其整然的系統，如一看中國，泰國，緬甸等地的稻，與日本的，在各方面都有顯著的不同點。例如：輸入到日本來的米，無論在其口味上，性質上，光澤上，都與日本米有很大的差別，這是誰都可以一看即知的，但實際上還有其根本差別點，甚至於卵細胞與花粉在日本稻和南方稻中間都有絕大的不同點。一般說來，南方稻較高，平均爲五六尺，至於最高之浮稻，甚而有四公尺者。且其莖很粗大。而日本稻很矮，只不過四尺左右，從這一點也可以知道，南方稻的莖比總更重，普通穗這一部分，只佔二三成左右。而日本稻穗却佔五成以上。同時南方稻的莖質非當粗糙而且脆弱。日本的稻稈可以作蓆，可以作繩，而南方稻稈幾乎毫無用處。日本在收獲時連根拔出，而南方只割取其穗而不動其稈，在下次耕種時，則任其在田中腐爛成爲肥料。</p>
<p>再就收獲方面比較一下南方稻與日本稻。南方稻平均每段（日本田畝單位，合九九二弱平方公尺）產五斗，產一石者爲最好之成績。且有時有旱水等災，所以實際上平均只產三斗多。在日本　統計數字平均每段產二石餘，普通之收成往往四石，最好的收成往往多至六石。這是由於日本用肥料增植稻禾的關係，那末對於南方種若是加以肥料是否就得到良好效果呢？如果若不是吃米的人種逼他吃米，那只有把肚皮吃壞了，與此相同，南方稻與日本稻因系統不同，所以若把日本稻用的肥料給南方稻，則只長高其莖，稻本身反而軟弱起來，於是往往折倒。</p>
<p>那末把日本收獲最多的稻種，移植到南方去怎樣呢？那末日本稻就會因病和虫害而受到極大損害。那末爲什麼日本稻旣屬優秀，反而受到損害呢？這是由於日本稻有最大缺點，沒有耐虫性與耐熱性。於是便想到使强靱的日本稻與耐虫耐熱的南方稻配種。在這條件上，也要考慮到動物中雜種的例證，如馬與驢的雜種便是騾，但騾有不能生殖的缺欠，所以必須設計出如何補求這種缺點。混合種的稻穗結實者很少，大多數差不多都是粃糠，甚至可以說是毫無收獲的。要必須防止這種生殖力的减少。關於這一問題，就發生很多技術上的困難。於是這種研究在各該地開始得到了整個的嚮應。科學！科學！科學能克服一切困難，能使不可能者成爲可能。不久將向南方大量種植日本優秀的稻種，至少要增加四倍米的生意，這樣日子或許不遠了吧！（此種研究於五月十三日福岡縣公會堂發表）（　：譯自東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>阿根廷恢復　臨時政府宣告成立　內政方面將採嚴厲措置　外交政策仍將維持不變</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　阿根廷新總統羅遜將軍已於五日組成新內閣，定六日舉行就職禮。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊：阿根廷政府之陣容，已於昨晚正式宣布如下：總統羅遜將軍·副總統蘇埃洛海軍少將，內政部長史篤尼海軍少將·外交部長馬蒂奈資將軍·農業部長馬森將軍·公共工程部長比斯特萊尼將軍·財政部長羅薩·海軍部長蘇埃洛海軍少將·司法部長卡爾德隆·國防部長賴米雷茲將軍。阿根廷內閣閣員除二人外，皆爲軍界人物。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城六日電　據海通社訊，此間負責人士稱，阿根廷新政府在內政方面，將採取嚴厲之措置，但外交政策將維持不變。政府將於最近期間發表文告，詳述其目標與計劃。前任內政部長克拉錫蒂及前任農業部長維台拉之被捕，爲政府決心採取各項必要措置之明證，警察總署並下令監視共黨，防止叛逆活動。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城六日員　據海通社訊，阿根廷臨時政府之第一次文告，並未署名，僅申言履行國際義務而已。領導革命之軍事領袖宣稱：政黨均未參加此次運動，政府亦未接見政治領袖，此次運動純係軍事性質，針對政黨之腐敗而發，可視爲純粹內政問題而非外國壓力之結果。</p>
<h3>阿新總統通電就職</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊：阿根廷革命運動領袖羅孫將軍，發表就職通電稱：「此次事變後，余已於今日接任阿根廷政府軍事運動之領袖，敬請注意，惟於達到此項運動之目的所需必要之措施未宣布前，余請汝等實施一切步驟，使公共之治安與秩序不受妨碍，羅遜將軍簽字」</p>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊：阿根廷新任總統羅孫將軍，今年五十八歲。渠於十七歲時，入軍事學校肄業，經初步訓練畢業後，即加入騎兵隊。曾在羅斯泰諾與奧杜奈爾指揮之下，參加却谷戰事。三十六歲加入參謀本部，一九二七年被派駐在拉巴資，任軍事參贊，一九三〇年回國，被任騎兵學校校長，一九三四年調任騎兵第三團團長，三年後任職銓叙局局長，一九三八年任騎兵第一師師長，同時晋級爲將軍。此次阿根廷革命成功，羅遜將軍於星期五起，加入阿根廷之政治生活，担任總統之職。</p>
<h3>卡斯蒂洛恢復自由</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊：前阿根廷總統卡斯蒂洛，自拉普泰致電羅遜將軍稱：「軍事長官閣下，余特向閣下辭去過去所担任之職務，卡斯蒂洛簽字」。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據阿根廷京城電，阿根廷革命政府正式發表：阿總統卡斯蒂洛偕內長海長乘掃海艇「多拉蒙」號，於五日正午行抵阿京城南方之拉巴拉他港，旋在該地爲革命軍逮捕，解往京城，此刻已辭去總統之職。另據革命軍控制下之阿京電台廣播稱：卡斯蒂洛總統與其內閣業於五日全體辭職，卡斯蒂洛博士簽署辭呈後，即被釋放。</p>
<h3>革命事變前因後果</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊，近接革命黨方面息：阿根廷發生軍事叛變之起因，爲國家民主黨提名柯斯泰斯爲總統之候選人，柯斯泰斯爲卡斯蒂洛總統與其中立政策之忠實擁護者，故渠之提名深爲軍部方面所反對。國防部長賴米雷茲與其他陸軍軍官未能使卡斯蒂洛總統撤銷柯斯泰斯之提名權，因根據阿根廷憲法之規定，總統無干涉此事之責任。卡斯蒂洛總統並下令將國防部長賴米雷茲免職，任偮馬貴斯將軍爲其繼任者，因此軍部派代表向卡斯蒂洛總統提出最後通牒，要求於星期五上午十時之前予以答覆。總統不得已，遂偕同內閣閣員登掃雷艦「多拉蒙」號，同時軍艦中之革命份子即接管政府。革命份子即接管政府。革命份子由賴米雷茲·羅遜·費萊爾等將軍，與蘇伊洛海軍少將領導之。當羅遜將軍進軍阿根廷京城時，新聞記者問以革命運動是否將與政黨合作，渠答稱，「我人皆屬阿根廷人，並無政治黨派之分」，此語對自以爲革命運動對渠等有利之急進黨與國家主義者，不啻一晴天霹靂。惟革命運動所持之基本原則，尙在各方期待之中，警署於最每一分鐘禁止政府黨之開會，足證此次革命運動，純屬軍事性質，與政黨並無關係。但有若干不良份子乘機擾亂秩序，直到警察出動裝甲車巡邏全城，秩序始告恢復。星期六大部份店舖尙停止營業，全城交通亦入停頓狀態，各重要所在皆駐有軍警以維秩序。事變時人民皆未知事實之眞相，待羅遜將軍發表安民布告後，人民始得明曉一二。該安民布告中稱。柯斯泰斯所計劃之政府，不能爲秩序之保證，其中若干政府家當負此次事變之責任云。</p>
<h3>美英兩國所持態度</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　海通社引華盛頓有資格方面消息：美對阿根廷新政權，在阿方實踐某種條件，即將予以承認。華府各界接獲阿國革命消息後，僉以爲該項革命，係針對卡斯蒂洛政府之嚴守中立政策而發，故對新政府之加入反軸心，予以熱烈歡迎。彼等今宣稱，羅遜將軍亟應證明有維持法律與秩序之能力，並能承認並履行阿國之一切國際義務。惟在阿國情勢不安定前，華府方面之態度可以審愼二字稱之。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　路透社外交訪員昨晚聲稱，英官方在阿根廷政變之現階段，雖未便作任何批評，但可斷定英政府在相當時期，將承認賴米雷茲之新政府。</p>
<h3>西班牙建議設置安全區域　籲請交戰顧全人道</h3>
<p>瑪德里六日中央社電　西班牙政府鑒於此次大戰中，各交戰國之非戰鬥員因遭轟炸而犧牲至鉅，故於五日向各交戰國建議，籲請各國於轟炸時注意人道。又西外部當局並就此項提議，特發表聲明，謂西政府此次向各交戰國提出此項建議，乃本乎西班牙之嚴正中立立塲及純粹人道觀念而提議者，毫未任何交戰國之暗示</p>
<p>瑪德里六日電　據海通社訊：西班牙外交部正式提出設置安全區之建議，該安全區不受恐怖之轟炸，以重人道，該部向報界提出下列各點。</p>
<p>（一）各交戰國當指出包括軍事目標之區域。（二）各交戰國當指出含有一部份軍事目標之區域，並詳細註明軍事目標之所在。（三）無軍事目標之區域亦當加以指出，該區不得加以轟炸，如該區內設有軍事目標，則交戰國間對此當獲得諒解。（四）任命中立國之常設委員會，各交戰國亦可派「顧問」參加之，該委員會之性質與第一次世界大戰時之「戰俘委員會」相類，其任務爲管理此項約束之實施。</p>
<p>西班牙外交部指陳此項建議，並非意圖限制空軍之活動，乃完全基於人道之觀念，外傳西班牙係受外國之利用之訊，實完全不確，凡各大國之外交部皆能證明西班牙之獨立性，與保護其主權之熱心云。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　今日廣播演說</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據華盛頓電訊，昨據白宮公布：羅斯福總統定於明日向出席溫泉會議各代表發表廣播。</p>
<h3>英相將向下院報告　華府會議經過</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩六日中央社電　據倫敦昨晚所發公報稱：下議院下次開會時，邱吉爾首相將作簡短之陳述。據信邱氏將報告其最近與羅斯福會商及訪問阿爾及爾與突尼西亞之經過。</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩六日中央社電　英內閣昨日開全體會議，由邱吉爾主席，會議係在邱吉爾自北非返至倫敦後數小時舉行。同時倫敦之消息靈通方面昨日否認邱吉爾曾參與特戈爾與季勞在阿爾及爾舉行之談判，據云邱氏偕冊英總參謀長勃魯克將軍，僅於法國國民解放委員會產生之後參加典禮而已。邱氏僅於星期五在英國地中海艦隊總司令克寗漢設宴時，曾與特戈爾及季勞會見。據昨日透露，邱氏抵北非時，同行者有英外相艾登，勃魯克將軍·及美國總參謀長馬歇爾將軍。此一行人等曾與艾森霍華·亞力山大·蒙高茂萊及安特遜將軍等曁鐵達空軍元帥·與其他軍事領袖會商多次。此間謂此項會商，乃繼續華盛頓之討論云。</p>
<h3>美煤礦工潮解決　五十萬工人復工</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　美礦工聯合會昨日已命令五十萬工人，於星期二復工。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　華盛頓來電：美國東部煤礦工之罷工糾紛，四日經路易萬人失業之向工人勸告復業，及煤礦公會決定復業，故實際上等於政府方面勝利。煤礦業於過去五日間，受罷工之損失極大。路透社紐約特派員伊姆生曾估計此項損失量達千萬噸云。其中賓夕法尼亞洲彼茲堡之加納基伊利諾斯製鋼所，蒙受損失尤極重大。五日因焦煤之缺乏，故該製鋼廠之熔鐵爐已有十一個熄火云。又公司方面發表稱：公司方面爲維持其他熔鐵爐起見，刻正積極努力中，由此可見其損失如何重大矣。</p>
<h3>華北特輯　華北前途自强在望　華北日軍大城戶部隊長談話</h3>
<p>日本轉換對華政策後之華北各項情形，關於華北日軍之現狀與今春之戰果，中國參戰與日本對華方針以及華北今後問題與當前各問題，頃承華北日軍大城戶部隊長於四日向記者樂：華北日軍遵從國策，自本年初起，轉換對華政策，結果華北人士均能重新認識中日協力之意義，力謀自强。華北之建設，亦正逐步趨上軌道，其要旨可分以次數點：</p>
<p>（一）華北軍之現狀與今春之戰果</p>
<p>華北日軍自本年初起，將向由軍部處理之政治，經濟事件，移交華方自理，日軍在大局上已勘定華北全境，同時極力援助華方奠定自强之基。結果華北軍祇須负担作戰事宜，在打擊渝共兩軍方面，獲得顯著戰果，軍部之任務，旣如此簡捷，故戰力能自然加，試觀戰果之統計，俘虜截獲品兩項，至去年四月底止，渝共軍歸順者計七百三十九次，兵員三萬一千六百四十七名，迄本年四月止之歸順次數約五百次，兵員約十萬名，查後者次數少而兵員多，足證渝共軍已有認識，故能集合來歸，同時渝方戰意消沉。戰力减退，情勢益爲顯明。</p>
<p>（二）華北之使命與當前諸問題</p>
<p>華北在大東亞戰爭中居於兵站根據地之地位，且爲建設大東亞之中心地帶，其地位與使命，今後更見重要，此際賦予吾人之責務，即是使華北成爲中日兩國在物質精神上協力之理想境地。欲造成眞正之協力關係，必須開發經濟，以便推進中日協同戰爭。但華北尙有中國共產軍，此實爲建設華北之障碍，深恐無智人民一日爲中共所騙。按中共之目的，即爲乘亂而赤化中國，以謀樹立其獨裁政權，目下蔣介石採取容共政策，然蔣亦明知中共之本質，不過圖一時之利用。日軍爲建設健全之華北，決心澈底剷除中共軍，是以認清其以虛僞宣傳與威迫而攏絡民眾之陰謀，確立剿共對策，展開活潑行動，實爲當務之急。尤其須要華方之新政治普遍深入民間，蓋剿共工作單靠武力，尙嫌不足，但看以民眾援護爲背景之中共戰略，則華方之新政治力量，必須緊接日軍之武力，普遍深入已遭赤化之鄉村，日軍對此尤爲關切，更不惜予以充分支援。</p>
<p>（三）華北日軍之必勝形勢</p>
<p>華北之一切，誠如上述，歷經過去六年來，苦心建設，確信成功之途匪遙。自本年初起，華北日軍遵循國策，改變施策，同時華北人士亦均重新認識中日協力之眞意，積極自强之氣運，頓呈白熱化，一方面華北日軍之整個戰力，積極提高，憑此實力，保衛華北，協力恢復治安，推進健全建設，總之，華北日軍充滿必勝僱，希望華北人士對於日軍之公正態度，寄予信賴，以建設華北而貢獻於新中國之健全發展與完成大東亞戰爭。（雲鵬：譯自六月五日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>北京通訊　故都學術界的一角　一個中立國的文化機關</h3>
<p>— 學子</p>
<p>在這火藥的氣味迷漫在全世界的時候，中立國本來就是很稀罕的，由交戰國而再變爲中立國，更是絕無僅有的事。凋零的時節，文化機關的創立本來就是很稀罕的，文化機關而只專門研究漢學，更是難能可貴。因此，在這雙重的「稀罕」之下，「中法漢學研究所」的創辦之所以耐人尋味，也就不算稀奇了。</p>
<p>中法漢學研究所是前年秋天駐華法國大使館所創辦的一個學術機關。這號稱近世西洋文化中心的法蘭西和中國文化溝通的淵源是很早的。十六世紀末葉，法蘭西的耶穌會徒，就對中國作有一些零星的研究，而眞正用科學的方法來研究中國的則開始於十八世紀初年，其中以馬若瑟，宋君榮兩司鐸的功勞爲最巨，再經過十九世紀雷慕沙，儒蓮兩敎授的努力，就奠定了現代法國西漢學的基礎。法蘭西之成爲世界漢學的研究中心，久已成世界學術界所公認的事實，在這國際時局最微妙的時刻，駐華法國大使館居然想在學術文化方面打開一條新路，創辦了中法漢學研究所，其對於學術界的貢獻，總不能夠一筆抹殺的。</p>
<p>研究所的所址最初是在東皇城根中法大學的圖書館樓下和其北面的幾間平房（中法大學的大樓是借給北大法學院用，所剩下的房子已無幾）。去年秋天就把研究室搬至稍北一點，以前　學研究所的樓下，只把圖書室和展覽室留在原來的地方。現在經過整理和刷新，研究所的外觀，倒也有幾分尊嚴了。</p>
<p>研究所的負責人有兩位，担任研究指導的所謂所長是鐸爾孟先生，實際上負行政責任的理事長是大使館的秘書杜柏秋先生。鐸先生是老中國啦，在中國的時候比在法國還長。三十多年前就來中國當京師大學堂的敎授，後來又在北大和中法大學執敎，後來又在北大和中法大學執敎，現在已經差不多是「頭　鬚眉皆似雲」的人了，然而精神仍很健旺，每次總是工作到二三點鐘。就是在這樣的勤學精神之下，他就成功了現在法國漢學界的一個脚色，雖然沒有什麼大著作，却是著名漢學家葛蘭言的後台老板。杜先生則是比較年輕的外交家。他是中國一位著名古董商人的女婿，大約是受了夫人的影響，對於中國的學術就發生了興趣，尤其是對於中國的古畫。他搜集了很多中國的古畫和古物，算是一位古董鑑賞家。中法漢學研究所的建立，他是頭功。我們可以天天看見他坐在最摩登的汽車裏往返於交民巷和東皇城根之間，是北京的一個忙人。</p>
<p>研究所內設四組：民俗組，語言組，歷史組和通檢編纂組。各組都有其特殊的工作和計畫。全所的研究員和庶務人員及書記等大約有二三十人。他們整天的到所辦公，想從破爛的古畫堆裏找出寶貝的發現。</p>
<p>研究所出了一種刊物，名爲「法文研究，」所登載的文章有兩大類：一是介紹法文的，多半是繙譯法文的名著，一是介紹中文的，多半是繙譯中文的佳作。專給外國人研究中文或中國人研究法文的一個參考資料。</p>
<p>研究所曾舉行過兩次展覽會，一是去年夏天的中國年畫展覽會，搜集各地所出年畫甚多，對於書中的人物故事，都作有簡單的考證，印成目錄。後來還由某電影公司攝成影片。海上人士說不定也曾在銀幕上見過杜柏秋先生在展覽室中指手畫脚的姿態。一是現在尙在舉行的十八十九兩世紀的法國漢學論著展覽會，搜集善本古畫七十五種，並西洋畫家爲清室所繪之平定伊犁囘部全圖十六幅，平定　　戰圖十二幅，都是難得的材料。其中尤以一七〇一年出版之李明著「中國現勢續錄，」八三一年出版之馬若瑟著拉丁文「中國語文剳記，」，一七七七至一七八五間出版之馮秉正著法譯「通鑑綱目。」十八世紀抄本「法漢蒙字典」等最爲稀見，所展覽的著作，該所出有目錄，對於作者的身世，及其研究漢學的始末都有簡略的介紹。總算是給寂寞的北京學術界凑了一齣熱鬧戲。</p>
<p>另外，爲着中國學生習法語，法國學生學習華語起見，又有法文夜校和漢文特別班之設立。這樣的結構總算是夠得上稱「中法」兩個字。</p>
<p>記得當中央研究院歷史語言研究所成立的時候，傅斯年先生曾說過一句話，認爲中國人應當努力把漢學的研究中心從巴黎移到北京。現在中央研究院的歷史語言研究所是隨着傅斯年先生而跑到「未過十人二三死」的瀘水旁邊。在北京除了這中法漢學研究所以外，就沒有第二個有組織的專門研究漢學的機關。然而這也欠整齊，何况是法國人所創辦的，目的總不免偏重於法國漢學家的培植。然則，傅斯先生的願望到底要等到那一天才有實現的希望呢？（六月二日）</p>

<h3>蘇益之案　無錫同鄕聲援　致函法院請主持正義</h3>
<p>本市自蘇益之被辱憤死案發生後，各界羣情激憤，輿論譁然，紛起指責劉王氏之不法，盼望司法當局及早判決，以快人心，惟特一院會於二日開庭審訊，竟因化騐單尙未送至，故改期十一日上午再訊。至於化騐單何故延遲尙未送達，各界頗多懷疑，議論紛紛。昨日適逢敎師節，無錫旅滬同鄉會特派員慰問蘇益之家屬，並致函特一院，請求主持正義，誓作後援。日內將召開理監事會議，商討進行辦法。該會盼望本市各團體主持正義，爲蘇案聲援。茲錄該會致特一院公函如下：「逕啓者：查本埠私立聖心中小學校敎師蘇益之女士，因責罰學生劉之俊，爲該生家屬劉王氏一再侮辱，氣憤身死。其間有無因傷致命等情，須得法醫檢騐後，始可定奪，茲姑不論。夫扑作敎刑，重道尊師，夏楚之事，見之經傳。乃該生家屬劉王氏，變橫成性，自信爲聯保辦事處書記之妻室，不知奉公守法，胆敢利用地位，恣肆咆哮，拳足交施，殊堪痛恨，非嚴予懲處，無以維敎育之尊嚴。本會與蘇益之女士同鄉關係，今覩蘇女士慘死，情形殊深憫憐，自應寄與同情爲其後援。除分函聲援外，　應函達，即希查照，將劉王氏嚴予科罰，以平公憤，而雪沉冤，至級公感，此致上海第一特區地方法院。無錫旅滬同鄉會，」</p>

<h3>補救製紙原料恐慌　首批紙漿月內運滬　紙價可望逐步抑低</h3>
<p>紙價高漲，影響文化事業非淺。本市迭紙原料之紙漿，前因停止配給，故派員向日方請求繼續配給後，因消息沉沉，致本市造紙業方面，以原料缺乏爲籍口，迭次增高紙價</p>
<p>首批紙漿本月運滬頃據悉，該項紙槳原料來源，業已獲有辦法。第一批紙漿五千噸，可於本月中，自日本，台灣，滿洲等處運滬。此後於七·八·九·十月中，情狀若無變異，財續有三千噸至五千噸之紙漿運滬。</p>
<p>紙漿價格可望抑低</p>
<p>本市目前華商造紙廠共計十七家，自去年九月份起迄今，即未獲配給紙漿，以舊字紙爲造紙之主要原料，致廢字紙之價格爲之大增，而造紙廠生產量亦减至六成。此次紙漿運到後，因其質佳價廉關係，本市造紙工業，當可重振。而紙張價格，亦可望予抑低云。</p>
<h3>流民習勤所　積極僱工建築　救世軍將設　乞丐沐浴所</h3>

<p>着手辦理收容事宜據云當局已在漕河涇購田九十畝，籌筑房屋四百間，市政當局及世界紅會均撥巨款經營，預料該流民習勤所，卽可於本年內完全吿成。爲維持夏季衛生，保全街道淸潔起見，該習勤所雖未全部完成，但已着手辦理收容事宜。</p>
<p>路乞生活已瀕絕境</p>
<p>查路丐大都均無居住證，是以當局以此一端，卽有理由令其遣赴漕河涇。據云一般路丐，以生活之艱困，目前大多均在存亡邊界中掙扎，是以當局如令其在習勤所生活，則無有不願者。</p>
<p>救世軍乞丐營近況</p>
<p>救世軍乞丐營，本年度舉行募款一月運動，其目標原定二十萬元，惟結果僅募得六萬元，尙少十四萬元，成績殊爲低落。同時據該營某員吿記者，該營計劃於今夏設一乞丐沐浴所，俾乞丐憑券沐浴，以維持乞丐個人及大衆之衛生。</p>

<p>特稿</p>
<h3>國家與敎師</h3>
<p>— 周化人</p>
<p>—卅二年敎師節在上海電台廣播詞—</p>
<p>各位敎師，各界同胞，今天是敎師節，衣我沒有說到本題之前，我想起最近發生的兩件事，令人非常感慨，一件是聖心中小學敎師蘇益之先生的自被，一件是中學生美濂江的殺害同學，前者是一個家長沒有受過敎育，隨便侮辱敎師，以致敎師效憤而死，後者則可謂是學校敎育的失敗而發生的，我們而對着這兩次敎育上的案件說起來眞是慚愧，眞是痛心，而今天適是教師節，要我來說幾句話，便有點不勝感慨繫之了，但這兩件事情都有它的最大成因，有它的社會背景，我們也不必責難要誰來負責，不過我們要求國家社會對於敎師，要負一種責任，而敎師對於國家社會，也應盡一種義務，現在我想就這兩　加以說明。</p>
<p>一，岡家對於敎師應負的責任教師們忍飢耐寒，任勞住怨的作者靑少年，其目的當然不是希望得到學生的什麼報酬，而是抱着一個崇高的理想，爲了國家民族光大的前途，使下一代的國民脫離黑暗時代的生活，故不惜犧料個人目前的安逸，不避精神與生活上的痛苦，以爲國家養育人材，爲社會造就良好的公民，敎師們的志願如此純潔正大，所以國家社會對於他們，應當表示尊重，盡扶植和保障的責任，近不僅是對他們的淸苦表示同情，對於他們的勤勞表示欽敬，而必須負起具體的扶助的責任，所謂具體的責任，第一是對於師資的培養，國家要出良好的公民和有用的人材，必須有良好的敎師，良好師資的造成，須有良好的師範學校制度，我們試一檢查今日的師範學校情形如何，設備固然因陋就簡，而造就出來的師範學生，也不一定從事教師職務，因此，學校裏服務的敎師，十之七八不是師範人材，而濫竽充數者，則反居多數，以這種情形來看，今日師資的缺乏，實爲敎育上的一件憾事，所以努力於師資的養成，當長目前的一個重要工作，但培養師資，並不是立刻可以辦到的，衣師範學校制度沒有完善以前，舊有的敎師是應該加以訓練的，即是一面造就新的師資，一面對原有的敎師加以再訓練，使不至靑黃不　，而師範學校的學生，尤應施以嚴格的訓練，以養成健全的師範人材。</p>
<p>第二是任用的問題，師範的學生經過嚴格的訓練，其畢業後應即派爲學校敎師，其待遇當與公務員平等，因爲爲國家盡敎導國民之責，與公務員服務國家一樣，故公務員應有之待遇，教師亦應同樣享受，經過訓練及合格的敎師，不能無故更調或辭退，以保持共永久戰位。</p>
<p>第三是保障的問題，師範畢業的教職員，應有確實的保障，如規定年功加薪？以保證他們的生活，沒有過失不能辭退，以保證他們的職位，採用保險及儲蓄制度，以保障他們的意外事件的發生，其他如敎師的福利事項，也須詳細計劃實施，這些都是應由國家特別規定的事。</p>
<p>第四是獎勵的問題，不獨是應該獎勵他們工作的努力，不獨應該獎勵他們的恒心，不獨獎勵他們對科學的敎育有所貢獻，還應該獎勵他們不斷求知的精神，獎勵他們特殊技能的發揮，而獎勵的方法則分名譽獎勵升級獎勵及特別獎勵數種，其成續優異者，國家應予以特別培植與提拔，上述四者，不過是舉例來說，但即此四者，也就是國家社會對敎師應盡的最低限度的責任。</p>
<p>二，敎師對於國家應盡的義務關於這一點，我想各位敎師早已明白，而且在實行，用不着我多說，但我以爲處今日的時代，敎師除了學校敎育應盡責之外，還應注意到社會教育的問題，和時代思想的問題，學校固然是敎育機關，而社會也是一個敎育的塲所，學校的敎育即使辦好，而社會環境太壞，很容易使學生在學校所受的敎育消減於無形，所以我們致力於學校敎育，同時須注意社會的敎育。那就是學校敎師一方面衣學校盡忠職守，同時在社會上要以身作則，樹立楷樓、起模範作用，使社會的風氣改變，造成社會的良好環境，然後學校敎育與社會敎育打成一片，才能達到敎育最高的効能，這是敎師應盡的義務之一，其次關於時代思想問題，學校是爲國家教育國民而　的，國民的思想正確與否，教師負極大的責任，所以敎師對於時代思潮，必須澈底認識，譬如和平反共建國的綱領是國家敎育的方針，而大亞洲主義及建　東亞新秩序，則爲時代思想的指導理念，我們必須秉承國家的敎育方針，灌輸時代思想的理念，於國民使能互相團結一致，勞力以求東亞民族的解放。這是敎師應盡的義務之二，敎師旣然受了國家的栽培，社會的尊重，家長的委託。則其對於教育事業，視爲終身戰務，自是當然的事，惟因職貴重大之故，其知識必須隨時代而俱進，否則知識落伍，不能達到其所負的使命，爲補充自身的知識，則須時時進修不斷的求知，一方面求經騐的增進，一方面求新知識的增進用其畢生的精力，以盡瘁於　育事樂，這是敎師應盡的義務之三。</p>
<p>最從我想表示一點意見，敎師們忍受物質缺乏產活窮苦的痛苦，而繼續發揮他們爲國家服務的精神，這是令我們極端欽佩的，上海大中小學敎師不下一萬三千餘人，小學敎師每人每月平均所得的生活費不到三百元，中學敎師平均不到五百元，這稱物質的生活眞是比之販夫走卒都不如，而他們還是抱着爲國家作育人材的壯志，繼續服務，實足使人肅然起敬，但這種情形，我們不能認爲是應該的希望，國家社會方面，應給予敎師們以生活的保障。</p>
<p>末了，我要告訴各位漱師，當第一次歐戰德國失敗之後，德國的敎師，每日僅食兩片黑麵包。而其教導靑年的精神，始終不懈，二十年後的今日，德國又已艱難困苦的從事敎育工作，將來一定是有代價的，我們所得的代價，就是國家民族的獨立自由與平等，當在我們茹苦含辛的時候，只有拿這句話和大家作安慰與勉勵。</p>

<p>賭塲爲害之烈，本報曾數度申論，然仍未見當局對於賭塲的取締有具體的辦法和行動，這是很使我們市民失望的。試觀南市各區的大小賭塲，每日沉淪其中者何止千萬人，而且多數還是一般靑年子弟。傾家蕩產，身敗名裂，已是嗜賭者必然的後果，而許多人仍執迷不悟者，一則果由於賭徒的意志薄弱，無自制力，咎由自取；一則亦是賭塲具有極强烈極巨大的引誘力所致。所利用之引誘力，均爲心理學上最强烈者：如供給賭客食慾的滿足，嗜好的滿足，享受的滿足，仔細地想想，這兩座所謂娛心和「贏了想再贏輸了想翻本」樂塲所，它們的爲禍同胞，較之賭塲，有過之無不及，何以呢？且看下而的理由：（一）地位良好：上海雖號稱擁有四百多萬人口，而兩租界實佔其最多數，兩塲位處法租界中心，交通便利，地位適中，其吸引力自然較賭塲爲大。（二）知識份子的涉足：一般地說，賭塲的主顧，不外是大腹便便的從商者和終日無所事事的女太太少奶奶及一些流氓之屬。此種人物，乃是社會的寄生蟲，國家的廢物，在此時此地，早應屏於淘汰之列，如此的「人」，又何足去憐惜呢？至於同力球塲及跑狗塲的出入人物，則大大的不同前者了。筆者寓居亞爾培路，常見靑年學生（尤以大學生居多）之出入其問者。不衣少數，他們金錢的慾籌，又利用賭客的　倖的心理，以遂共殺人不見血，大量吞噬賭客精血的目的。據統計：每日因賭傾家者日有五六十家，喪生者日有數人，且成爲上海之罪惡淵藪。爲害之烈，由此可知。若仍因循姑容，上海一部分市民，一部分有爲靑年，勢必爲其吞噬，治安前途亦頗可慮也。</p>
<p>昔日，滬四區緒塲林立，自潘達局長就任後，雷厲風行，快刀理麻，不數日已金部肅淸。我們深爲佩服潘局長大刀闊斧的手腕，希望南市當局亦來一下，將各地賭塲全部封閉，不必顧慮其他問題，忍痛剜爛齋，市民得以安居樂業，這是我們全滬市氏深所盼望的。</p>
<p>賭塲旁的押當店、助桀爲　，重利盤剝，置人道於不顧，利息之高，當期押期之短，古今罕有。每家押當店，大抵經營兩項生意；即當物及押當票。當物均係二個月滿期，利息每月八分，另外須加「棧租」「存箱」等費一成。譬如衣服一襲當一百元，當票上所寫爲一百十元，取贖時加上八分利息，若未滿一月，須一百十八元八角，另加「印花費」數角。兩月滿期不贖，即被充沒。至於「押票」，利息之重，夏慘無人道，例如一張當票，票面爲二百餘元，約可押三四十元，而利息每元竟須三角之互。如押四十元，取贖時則須五十二元。期限有一個月，有三星期，有半個月不等。押時由押店出一張所謂「限價定期代賣證」，上寫明「當票X張，已向他處借XX元，（即當款）現向本處借XX元（即押款）」若押四十元，則票上寫五十二元，取贖時須五十二元始能贖出當票。利息之巨，由此可見。</p>
<p>深望南市當局，對於賭塲及重利押當，下一絕大決心，根本劃除，絕對不準有賭塲及小押當和類似此類的存衣。對於重利押當，當局已二度申令查禁，叭第一次的飭令，未見發生效果，禁者自禁，營者自營，未知第二次能否有效？然罪魁禍首，尙在賭塲，若將賭塲全部封閉，則此類重利押當店即會自形消滅。否則，治標不治本，賭塲不剷除，此種押當終難絕跡，或且更有甚於此類之產生及變本加厲也。</p>
<p>禁止賭場聲中　話回力球場與跑狗場　甘仲安</p>
<p>記得兩年前，滬西賭塲林立，日以千百萬元出入計：其爲禍之烈，眞是罄南山之竹都書不盡的。幸而不久遂遭禁止，人民方在慶幸中，不圖南市繼滬西而興，該處賭塲的設立，猶如雨被春筍，公開地受到一般墮落者的歡迎，直到最近，各團體及與論界，始注意到它爲禍的熾烈。於是紛紛呈請當局，從速禁止，我想不久的將來一當局必有相當的處置，這是無庸筆者杞　的，不過，可異的是與賭塲相侔的變象賭塲，如最有「名」的囘力球塲和跑狗塲，却始終沒有人公開的提出。請求富局禁止。</p>
<p>有的爲了好奇心，抱着參觀的態度進塲，却被魔力吸引了。其一則是養尊處優的紈袴子弟，、拿了父兄的不義之財，去任意揮霍。以上爾種人，正當年靑力壯，理宜積能蓄才，以備國家之用，乃竟不知爲此，而甘自墮落，誠使人不勝浩歎之至。由以上爾點觀之，我們已經覺得有禁止的必要，何况筆者智力魯純，安知沒有更重大的害處爲筆者所疏忽呢？再者，當此國家危急存亡之際，在本國領土上，竟有此種怪現象，未免大不相稱了。</p>
<p>或曰：二塲所位居法租界，其他當局不能越俎庖代，此言誠然，但我們可以儘量地和租界常局洽商。</p>
<p>考法租界當局之所以尤許設立此兩座，娛樂塲所，不外使租界多一筆收入而已；可是我們以爲這，是不正當的收入。因爲租界方面的收入，而貽害大衆，這是應該的麼？所以筆者希望法租界當局，爲上海人民起見，從速禁止之，至於禁止後，兩塲所的應用，自然以爲民利益爲主題，該　狗塲占地廣闊，除仍作　球之用外，應闢其一部，稱植花草，供公務人員學生公餘課餘遊憇之用。同力球塲則可作爲人民集會塲所或大衆食堂，可仿北四川路靑年會食堂，以利人民）大槪都銀適宜。如此一來，法租界在經濟上的收入，自然减少　；可是她可以獲得上海人們的贊美，此種精神上的獲得，自然勝過金錢的收入了，質之法租界當局，以爲如何？（酬移華北賑災）</p>

<h3>詩人和乞丐</h3>
<p>— 史介元</p>
<p>詩人，林義，預備創作他的大作了！他沉思着，在房間裏轉了兩轉，於是對坐在桌旁的弟弟說：「把小菜碗移開去！這個位子讓給我。」接著，按放下紙和筆，該是靈感降臨的時候了。</p>
<p>邊上坐着四五個親戚，等他的父親有事；她們，吱呀喳的，放肆地聊天。在這個環境裏，本是不宜於創作的。無奈，家裏只有一間屋子，屋子裏只有這一張桌子。</p>
<p>「寫詩呢？還是小說！」詩人托着頭，還在考慮這個問題；照他的習慣，——如果打句術語，應該說是他的創作態度——總是覺着需要寫些東西了，才開始思索題材，決定創作的樣式。這裏的所謂需要包括稿費和大名。林義是個詩人，論理，創作美麗的詩篇是無欵的。可是，今天他給這個問題迷惑了：「還是嘗試寫小說吧？詩不能拉長，稿費太微了！」爲了稿費，他拿定這個主意「不過，小說家不及詩人受推崇；小說家這句字更沒有詩人那末高雅。我才發表了兩首詩……」當另外一種慾念衝動的時候，他又陷入矛盾的心理中。前幾天，他在某報副刊上發表了兩篇小說，同學們開始稱他爲詩人，他自己也頗感到得意。如今，才發表了兩首詩，就轉變爲寫小說，未免跟詩人這雅號不符。並且，他還打算出一本詩集的，似乎得多創作幾首。</p>
<p>他把這個問題深深思考了三刻鐘，一直在猶疑的泥淖中打轉了，拔不出泥脚。焦急地抓抓頭皮，身上像給許多噘針刺着似地燥熱一陣，額上滲出黃汗來，眼睛依舊朝着白紙發呆。</p>
<p>邊上的娘兒太太們，談鋒可來得健，你爭我辯，高聲談論，不調勻的語調刺着耳朶，像是特地和我們的詩人搗蛋：</p>
<p>「我說無論如何不值得！」</p>
<p>「出錢買糠，自然不值得，然而這個年頭跟往年不同，戶口米裏揀出來的糠榖儘夠呬兩隻鷄了。」</p>
<p>「廢物利用，一個錢也不花！」</p>
<p>「二嫂的話不錯，順昌下次去的時候，我得託他帶兩隻鷄，一斤重的。錢……」</p>
<p>「錢！小嬸，慢慢算好啦！那兒的鷄，確是很便宜。路上帶鷄，阿義的爸爸說，也便當，查得不緊！」</p>
<p>「也好，反正下次我們還得算賬，上次「赤膊」，虧空了的錢還沒算給我呢！」</p>
<p>詩人的思緒，像抽亂了的綫團，找不　頭緒；客人們又沒有修養，不怕打擾他，把他的思緒攪成了亂七八糟的一團，　住他的頭腦。</p>
<p>「別響！別響！」突然什麼捧着腦袋，像是：要捉住那電閃般的想頭，他驀地高嚷起來，不耐煩地急轉身子。</p>
<p>「怎末？不適意？」她擱下兩在洗刷的飯碗，問。</p>
<p>「今天確是特別悶熱，有點　黃梅天氣，」小嬸摸着她的橫S頭「看　他頭上儘是汗　」</p>
<p>「頭痛！」媽按着他的脖子「阿義睡一會兒吧！」</p>
<p>「不是頭痛，用不着睡！」詩人窘迫地望望她們，無從分　。他彈動着手指，搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「不是頭痛，捧起頭幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「我在想……」</p>
<p>「別用功了」媽强迫他去睡「多讀點書，不還是一樣。賺錢發財不關讀書的事！」</p>
<p>他惘然瞧着媽，給强拉着。按在床上：「我實在沒有病呀！我在想……」</p>
<p>「還要倔強！」瞪了他一眼，媽又去洗碗了：「小空不補大洞叫苦，生起病來，藥吃不起！」</p>
<p>「糟糕！人吐了一口唾沫，開始付着文思，現在，他已經決定了寫小說。是一個鬱金香那末嬌滴滴的小姑娘熱戀大學生的戀愛悲訓；「調換了主角的名字，把故事改造一下，就立刻又是一篇小說了。好！立誓今天完成他！」</p>
<p>他興奮着站立起來，坐下在桌旁，對母親請求：「媽，我頭不痛了……」</p>
<p>「隨便你，不聽話，我又什末辦法？」媽陪起笑臉，在和小嬸切切低語。</p>
<p>握着那枝不能吸墨水的自來水筆，他在底稿上寫下了小說的起首：</p>
<p>「月亮，」宛如黯藍天幕中的一個破洞，洩進神秘銀光。風，聖基督嘆息裏嘆息，向自己低訴着一個悲哀者底悲哀，星兒，閃着愛戀的眼，撒播下……」</p>
<p>寫着，寫着……自來水筆凝住在那兒了；應該怎末形容星兒的光呢？神秘的！已經用過了，愛戀的——是他們的眼：燦爛的——太平淡了。除此，他的腦袋像是一張白紙。再沒有別的字彙了。於是，他躊躇了一下，拿起今見的報紙來，讀着副刊，想在那裏找出一個奇麗的字眼來。</p>
<p>「我們需要大眾化文學」這個怪驚人的標題呈　在眼前，需要大眾化的文學？旣然，是需要的，那末寄這種作品去，必然會錄取了。他想着，聚精會神讀下那篇論文。那裏總論着上海文藝界的惡劣傾向，全然趨向了紙級的趣味；最後以激昂的警句打下結論：「在這個全世界都已陷入了時代的旋渦裏，新生的勢力正在擺脫着世紀的枷鎖，光明與黑暗都傾注全力在搏鬥的時候，我們還需要風花雪月的病態文學嗎？和大眾游離的作品，決談不到戰鬥性和建設性，我們需要眞正大眾化的作品，反映大眾的痛苦和要求，打倒風花雪月的病態文學。」</p>
<p>「是的」！詩人的情感激盪了！「我們需要大眾化的作品」！握起筆，在底稿上劃了兩個大槓。表示打倒這病態的文學。</p>
<p>「然而，寫些什麼呢？」這囘，他又迷惑了；不寫哥呀，妹呀，牧師，鋼筆能手，藝術家的戀愛小說，他再也幻想不出什末人物和故事來了。大眾的痛苦，大眾的要求在那裏呢？他沒法捉摸。「看來，應該到街上去，去體會了大眾的痛苦和要求，再來寫！」他這樣決定了：在半個鐘頭裏體會了大眾的痛苦和要求，有了材料，三個鐘頭裏，完成他。</p>
<p>「阿義！早點囘來！六點鐘還得到十三號碼頭去給你爸爸拎東西，可以省幾塊車錢……」出門的時候，媽媽在背後寫明了一大串，關上了門，後面的句子糢糊了。</p>
<p>詩人在馬路上蹓躂，對面的烟紙店門口，爭買香烟，是平賣派貨的時候。</p>
<p>「全祿牌兩包，快點呀」！</p>
<p>「一包支加哥，別慢吞吞的，人家擠了老半天」！</p>
<p>「五塊四角，三塊三七，大票子不要」！</p>
<p>一個剪短髪的娘姨擎起兩包全祿牌，擠向外來，一只粗大的手緊按住那豐滿的胸部。</p>
<p>「殺千刀」！笑罵着，輕佻地擺動那鴨屁股似的短髪。</p>
<p>「嘻……哈」</p>
<p>詩人湊臉去：買了香烟做什麼？自己做生意！」</p>
<p>「呸！猪　！」娘姨瞪了他一眼，輕蔑地扭着肥大的臀部去了，詩人愕然以眼光跟隨她的背影。</p>
<p>「忖什麼好心思？壽頭！」擠上來工人模樣的大漢子「不買香烟，請滾開！」</p>
<p>詩人踉蹌退了兩步，和第一個人撞了個滿懷，</p>
<p>「對不起」他周轉身來，是一個賣杜米的「背着這未重的杜米交關吃力吧？」陪着笑臉，爲了體騐痛苦。</p>
<p>「交？」（註，背米的成交的時候，價錢往往說另頭，譬如六十五塊說五塊）五塊，你帶不帶秤？「那個瞧瞧對面的人物，聽錯了話：頎長的個子，肩上泛了紫紅色的藍布大褂，頂着一堆蓬亂的頭髪，蒼白的面頰上，一付式樣陳舊的近視眼鏡，光彩黯淡的眼珠在後面凝視着他，厚厚的下脣。掛着謙虛的笑——</p>
<p>「現在漕河涇的行市多少？你們背一次有幾塊錢可賺？」詩人打算跟那個做個較長的慰問，他悠閑地揷起腰，帶着十分同情的口吻問，接着長嘆了一聲：「海！……你們辛苦了，掮着兩斗米，跑這末還路，確是艱苦的事。可是，那些靠你們背來的米養活的大人先生們呢？一點也不同情你們！人類是爹未殘酷，自私的動物呀！海！……」</p>
<p>「漕河涇今天是三塊，背這末遠路，才賺兩塊錢一斗」含着無限的怨尤，一半是生活的枷鎖榨壓出來的，一半是預防對方的還價：「……你的秤可以拿出來啦！巡捕看見沒有關係的……五塊是最低的價錢可以「交」了」</p>
<p>「晤？……詩人呆住了，當他是賣米的，未免有點侮辱他，褻瀆詩人的雅趣；我？我才不是賣米的！我是作家！現在特地來體騐你們的痛苦！爲了反映你們的要求！……」</p>
<p>「媽的！不買米，別嚕蘇」那個大失其望，氣壞了。鼓足勁，背起米袋，惡毒地唾罵：「開人家玩笑？去你的！」</p>
<p>詩人的勇氣，這先餒了一半；心裏直是酸溜溜地不好過！可是爲了收集材料起見，他强壮着膽，繼續他的慰問體騐的工作。</p>
<p>大眾似乎並不覺着有這末一個詩人的存在，他們不打算跟他接近，更不需要他慰問痛苦，反映要求，有時候，甚至存着强烈的反感，險些兒遭他們的欺凌。</p>
<p>一次，轉入了一條僻靜的馬路，他瞧見兩個塌車夫，正吃力地拖着沉重的木柴，想登上一座花園的碎石道。</p>
<p>「去幫他們推上去！」鼓勵着自己，他俠義地使勁在後面推。在邊上，一個縮緊肌肉，竭力支撐着重載的車夫，感到了極度的憊疲，鬆下手，拭揮着汗流着的醬色臉孔。忽然，發覺後面有人在沉重地哼着。</p>
<p>「偷柴爿，畢三！」刺耳的江北音罵着，趕過來。</p>
<p>來不及解辯，那個已經揮動粗手捶來，他只好一隻喪家犬，急急逃亡了。</p>
<p>看來，他和大眾之間有垜不可跨越的牆豎立着，不知是誰，從什麼時候起砌起的。</p>
<p>溜了半天馬路，依然一無所得，怏怏乎掃興而歸。</p>
<p>「不知好歹，笨伯們！」胡思亂想了一套，漫罵着人們，很怏地，家已在眼前了。一個乞丐裏着破布，敝露了生滿瘡癬，膿血糢糊的屁股，將頭伸進半掩的後門裏，哆噥着，在乞求。</p>
<p>「滾開去！不會給你一個銅板的！」爲了發洩的受的委屈。他厲聲斥罵，討飯冷不防有誰來驅逐，惶惶左右囘顧了一會兒，皺着哭喪的臉，拖起破鞋去了。</p>
<p>「唔！……」狠狠釘着那個活　幽靈的背影，什麼東西立刻提醒了他，連忙調換了一付口氣「來！　！勿要逃！」</p>
<p>乞兒惘然轉囘頭一爲，打量着對方的面包，伸出那蘆柴管似的手來：「先生，可憐，可憐我吧！」</p>
<p>「別那末「先生！可憐，可憐！」的，我問你極重要的，有意義的事！」他怪腔地學着乞兒的腔調，直截了當談上了本題：「你是怎末淪落爲要飯的？」</p>
<p>「……」那個愕了一下「先生！可憐我們苦惱的，自從打了仗一直沒有生意！兩天沒有沾米氣了先生給我隻大餅錢吧！」</p>
<p>「總是要錢！」詩人不感到滿足，這末一點平淡的材料，不能寫成一篇小說的：「說得詳細點，關於失業以後的情形，譬如：晚上睡在什麼地方……」</p>
<p>「先生，我們要飯的不討錢做什麼呢？」乞兒的聲音更凄切了，「晚上？當然在馬路上！先生給我五角錢吧！」</p>
<p>「給你五角錢？五角錢又不能養活你一輩子！」拍拍胸部：「我不高興做這種不澈底的救濟工作，我要幹更有意思的，　　扶助你們，以我那枝生動的筆反映你們的痛苦……」</p>
<p>「……」蘆柴管似的手慢慢垂下來。……</p>
<p>這時候，他們的談話中斷了；後面的門敞了開來：——是詩人的媽媽。</p>
<p>「找東，找西，連影子也沒有！你死到什麼地方去了！」</p>
<p>詩人高昂起頭，默默無言，以爲不值得分辯，就是分辯也說不清。</p>
<p>「快提起綢袋到十三號碼頭去吧！」媽拉了他進來「已經五點多了，等一會兒，你父親又得發脾氣！」</p>
<p>「砰」門給關上了！乞兒的全身一震，狠狠怒視着那灰黑色的後門。</p>
<p>「孩子不學好！」媽還在不休地嘮叨，牢　話是永遠像河水那樣流着，不會盡的：「水向低頭，人望高；你正經事忘了不幹，曾去跟討飯攀談！」</p>
<p>詩人不睬她，獨自打算着：「小說寫不成了！還是作詩！」在腦子裏，他先立好了題目：「子夜的嘆息——乞兒的歌。」於是吟咏着：（內心在自詡：「過兩天，這首詩在××副刊發表後，將成爲「大眾詩人」了」）</p>
<p>「睡在冰冷的水門汀上，深夜黑色的幕帷，……」</p>
<p>這是詩人完成詩篇後的一個星期，照他的預期，該是他大作發表後的第三天。</p>
<p>父親已經第二次從平湖囘來了。前天，他到碼頭上來接父親的時候，父親呆立在那裏，身邊只放着一疊五斤重的年糕。他見兒子來了，籟的落下淚珠來，他倆默然相覷着，喪失了魂魄，不知所措。終於，還是他有氣無力地提起年糕，垂頭喪氣囘家來。</p>
<p>「又赤了一膊」！」親戚們託帶的東西都充公了。損失五百多塊，說了些尖刻話，去了。說是爲着親戚，暫時且緩還償；可是，當不能多上，從此再也不託帶東西了。父親就是靠這些託帶東西的錢，在上海買些香烟，肥皂之類的貨色，到那裏販賣了。再買些年糕·飯·肉等等帶囘上海的，這囘沒有了本錢不能再去。在家裏睡了一天，直是唉吁呀吁！嘆息一通，拿母親做出氣筒。</p>
<p>今兒早上，他大清早京去，打下午二時半，才忽忽囘來。</p>
<p>「買六隻包子來，快點！」喘着氣，他給兒子三塊錢；接着，跟母親低語了。</p>
<p>我們的詩人正在拆一封信，是才退囘來的稿子，他的心不可抑止地急足撞擊着，揑了信封的手微微在顫動。起先，他不相信這是自己的退稿，或許是寄錯的吧？他想。然而那臆斷立刻幻滅了，綠色的稿子上，明明是自己絞乾腦汁，所寫成的詩。於是，他開始找尋：恐怕有什麼，「大作已經拜讀了，感佩萬分無奈環境……」之類的字條。然而，並沒有，尋找的功夫是白費的。</p>
<p>「是編者跟我搗蛋，有眼不識泰山！」</p>
<p>當父親喚他去買包子的時候，他才從紊亂的思緒中抬起頭來，手忙脚亂地接過錢。</p>
<p>買了包子囘來，恰巧又碰着那個乞丐灰汚的頭在東張西望。</p>
<p>「過來……」詩人發覺了至寶喚過乞丐來。可是這囘並不是體騐他的痛苦和要求。而是喚他來聆聽詩人的大作，體會其中的情感：「來聽我感到得流出淚來！這是我心血的結晶，也就是你們存在心裏，不能表達出來的痛苦，要求，怨尤和憤怒。可是，媽的！編者……」</p>
<p>於是左手揑緊了裏着包子的紙，右手掏出他的詩篇朗誦了：——那個奇怪地瞧着他不知在攪什麼鬼？接着以渴求的眼光釘賓那手中的包子。</p>
<p>「睡在冰冷的水門汀上，深夜黑色的幕帷，是我寬大無際的繡花被，堅硬的石階，聊充了枕頭……」</p>
<p>「什麼？我有繡花被蓋？」</p>
<p>「別響！精彩的地方在後面。」詩人擺擺手，繼續着：「星兒對我微笑撒下愛戀的光……」</p>
<p>「我從來沒有見星笑過，去你的！」突然，猛的一下子，詩人手中的包子落在乞兒手中了。</p>
<p>「咦！……」詩人大聲喊起來：「別跑，精彩的就來了！」可是乞兒沒有悠閑來傾聽他的朗誦。他撕破了黏有包子底上的紙，一日三個地基滿了嘴，跑向對面。」</p>
<p>詩人呆立了半嚮，垂着頭囘家來。</p>
<p>「包子呢？買了這末些時候，還沒買到？」父親忿怒地。</p>
<p>「給要飯的搶去了！」</p>
<p>「什麼？給討飯搶去了？無用的東西！」父親一連串罵下來，說他自己的辛苦，受人歧視，欺侮，現在大兒子又不掙氣，懦弱無能！……最後他說：「看來，越是書讀得高深，越是無用，明天一定叫你和我一起到平湖去，學學做生意的經絡……」</p>
<p>「可是，學校裏……要舉行月考了！……」</p>
<p>「月考？根本不讀書了，等你畢業還得一年半，我沒有這末多錢！」</p>
<p>詩人不能自克，流下了淚。</p>
<p>「哭什麼呢？」母親說：「父親的運氣不好，來去三次，倒有兩次「赤膊」……假使有了兩個人去，可以分開了拿……」</p>
<p>詩人無言佇立着，又想起寫作來：「寫什么好呢？反映，不，應該說是憤怒地呌喊出來，誰的痛苦和要求呢？</p>
<h3>志願</h3>
<p>— 子午</p>
<p>四點鐘F鎭中心小學放學了，天還在下着毛毛雨。接連幾天的春雨，操塲上泥濘不堪，天老仰呈着鉛灰色的臉，俯視着大地，一大羣小學生像雪地的小雀子，鼓噪着，雜亂地從學校裏囘去，頃刻間，學校又囘復到清凈。</p>
<p>劉教師拖着疲乏的脚步，上完了第六節課，挾了一大堆「作文」簿從六年級的敎室走到辦公室。</p>
<p>辦公個人沒有，每只寫字檯上都什亂地堆着簿冊，玻璃窗外透進　淡的光綫，空氣是那末陰沉。</p>
<p>劉教師在自己的坐位坐了下來，無力地把簿冊在桌上一推，他看到桌上正堆滿着許多沒有必的簿冊，似乎被一種責任心所驅使，無可奈何地抽出筆來。</p>
<p>「現在，照理我應該有些休息」他對自己說。</p>
<p>然而他並沒有休息，的確，他是應該休息了，今天已經上了五堂課，胡多半是舊式的，這些工作使他疲乏得像一個病人似了。</p>
<p>「我不知道爲什麼一定要做這敎員？」他對着簿冊懷疑着，「爲生活吧，說也可憐，還不夠自己的吃，然而這樣緊張的工作，也不能很好地幹……」</p>
<p>他望了望窗外的校園，校園裏的一切似乎也和他的心一樣地暗淡。於是他就取過作文簿來批閱，這期作文的題目是我的志願。</p>
<p>在他看過的每一本簿冊上，都顯出許多天眞無邪的雄心，孩子們像夢幻似地述叙他（她）們的抱負，他不禁感到一些興奮，默默地祝禱着說：「孩子們，願不久的將來，把一切都在世界上實現吧！」</p>
<p>不久，他發現了一篇比較突出的作品，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「我的志願，就是要消滅世界一切的醜惡，消滅人類的不幸，做一個偉大的救世者，我想開一個學校，讓貧苦的大朋友都有書讀，再開一家大工廠，使人人有工做，我自己呢？就做一個船主吧！過偉大的航海生活！」</p>
<p>他除了佩服這學生豐富的想像力以外，不禁喟然地感嘆着。他的心裏感到一陣惆悵，二十年以前，自己何嘗沒有這種抱負，在自己的學生時期，亦許還有更大的雄心，然而二十年的磨折，如今呢，連一已的生活都感到困難，這些雄心早已不知在甚麼時候消失了，現在只爲着生活而終日在粉筆灰中摸索，如今自己的命運和週圍似乎都充滿着粉筆灰似的迷糊。</p>
<p>想到這裏，他對着簿冊呆住了，似乎感到恥辱，不安，慚愧……</p>
<p>「人是應該有抱負的！」他肯定地想着了這些簿冊腦中又浮起那一羣可愛的，富有朝氣的小臉兒來，於是又獲得了勇氣似地：「祇要人不死，抱負是不應該死滅的」。</p>
<p>他那無神的臉上浮上一絲安慰的微笑：「是的，在我現在雖然生活是那末艱苦，但是我的工作是偉大的，縱然自己的一生，永久沒有實現自己的抱負，然而間接地從孩子們身上實現出來，那同樣是可貴而且值得興奮的。」</p>
<p>於是他又繼續地批閱，修正一些不順通的詞句，在最後一篇，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「我的志願是種田，還要幫助媽媽洗衣服燒飯…因爲我的家裏很窮，父親早已死了，媽媽很辛苦」。</p>
<p>那簡短的誠懇的叙述，不禁使他流下一股熱淚，心底深處泛起無限同情與憐惜，他看了對面上的歪斜的名字「陸金生」，腦中就記起白天在敎室中那枯瘦的孩子，臉上顯着營養不良，沉默，好哭……</p>
<p>「環境，可怕的環境！」他深深地嘆息着：「那是一個懂得生活的孩子，是生活敎育了他，在普通人看來，那似乎是一個沒出息的孩子，他不想做英雄或者偉人，他永久地承繼父親的職業，用手來勞動一生……」</p>
<p>不知甚麼時候，天下起更大的雨來了，室內已糢糊看不清東西的輪廓，劉教師的熱淚已濕透了他的衣襟，當他批完最後一本，全身已柔弱得不能支持了，四週寂沉得像墳塲一樣，祇有時哭啜着。</p>
<p>他深深地嘆了一口氣，吃力地從凳上移開身體，走到漆黑的臥室中，一般寒氣襲來，他無抵抗地拉着破絮壓在身上，閉上眼，靜靜地橫在床上，等候着天明。</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>發揮「互助精神」</h3>
<p>人類生活的値得珍貴，就在於「互助」。天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福，能助人者人恒助之，</p>
<p>日之「助人」，亦即爲他日「人助」之基礎，一部人類光榮燦爛的歷史，全是從奮鬥互助中開展出來的。</p>
<p>在「互助」的條件之下，也就含有「互惠」的意義。這種人類善良的本性，我們應當保持發揚。經濟有關於人類生活，最爲密切，是以經濟的幫助，也是較任何幫助爲急需，因爲他可以主宰一切，助益民生。</p>
<p>基於這樣的觀點，我們覺得目前經濟界，有幾件事値得反省和實行：</p>
<p>（一）華北賑災問題，眞是鬧得嚴重萬分，雖經各方推動，成績頗有可觀，但尙有繼續努力之必要。經濟界處境較優，籌款較易，是否已盡其最大責任，値得反省，我們爲此曾一再呼籲，希望能積極倡導，從速實行。</p>
<p>（二）澈查囤積，政府曾雷厲風行，其目的無非在求安定民生。現今拋出囤貨之限期已過，將作全面的物資調查，吾民衆爲自身利益起見，應急起協助，自動檢舉，使物價趨於正常平定。</p>
<p>（三）職生活，應力求改善，最近我們接得許多大眾生活的來稿中，多數對現下待遇，表示不滿，發出怨憤的呼聲。在此戰事時期，業務未易開展，固亦實情，但總希望業主在可能範圍內，盡量予以提高，務期能維持最低限度生活，同時員工亦宜體諒業主困難，努力合作，才是勞資雙方之幸。</p>
<p>上述三事，不過隨最近的觀感，舉一些例子，我們深覺「互助精神」之可貴，如何發揮光大，是每一個國民的責任，也可以說是全世界人類的責任。</p>

<p>讀者論壇</p>
<h3>建議設立強有力的經濟研究機關</h3>
<p>— 絮萼</p>
<p>要解決和改進整個　國民的經濟生活，惟有積極地從事經濟建設，國府參戰以後，中國的整個國民經濟。在政治上。是協力大東亞戰爭的時期；在經濟上，是正從戰爭破壞中，積極復興經濟，爲了實踐此艱巨的工作起見，最高國防臨時會議曾通過戰時經濟政策綱領，俾有所依據而實施；但欲求有效興貫澈，非有　盤的計劃不可，這就要仰賴於有組織的經濟硏究工作。</p>
<p>經濟研究工作在東四各國，已很發達：但在我國還僅二十幾年的歷史，在這短短的歷史中，除許多經濟學者個人研究的貢獻不計外，單以團體的工作情形來說，也有好幾個努力不懈的經濟硏究機關和其　寶貴的貢獻。我們再作普通的觀察，覺得經濟硏究工作在表而上已有急劇發展的趨勢。各重要公私機關都有重視經濟研究工作的表現，如有關經濟設施的各部會與其附屬機關，以至各省政府與其附屬機關，差不多都附設各調查室統計室之類的組織；而且不斷的有了再有。假如僅以單位計，我國經濟硏究機關之多，恐怕要超出各先進國家之上。所以可說我國的經濟研究機關，形式上是發展了；至於實際的貢獻，離理想的境地還遠，不過但不可一口抹煞若干可寶貴的貢獻；但這好像是例外的。普遍說來許多經濟研究機關工作的結果，確實得到有價値的貢獻的，遠不能與形式上的發展相提並論。</p>
<p>事變以後，這許多經濟硏究機關，停的停了，分散的分散了。整個經濟硏究工作，好說是陷於停頓之中，自從國府還都以後，工商經濟囘復正常，經濟研究機關有恢復的，也有新設的，又呈蓬勃的氣象；但是在量的方面，遠不如以前那樣的多，我們並不希望同以前一樣，把經濟硏究機關，當作機關團體點綴的門面，我們所需要的是質精而簡單化的經濟硏究機關。現在政府方面有全國經濟委員會的設置。依它的組織條例看來，它是爲了審核經濟政策，調節經濟行政而設置。當前總力參戰正在實踐的階段，經濟實是總力參戰的原動力。在此參戰期內，一面要確保軍需，一面要安定民生，嚴密的經濟計劃是萬萬少不了的。因此在國府經委會之內實有設立一個强有力的經濟硏究機關的必要。民間方面、現在雖有一二個粗具規模的經濟硏究機關，可是爲了種種關係，不能遠到理想的境地；並且担當不起如此艱巨的工作，所以我們希望這個新經濟研究機構，早日實現。這裏要聲明，爲節省公帑起見，應儘量縮小原機關行政部分的範圍，同時，應貫澈人才主義，吸收眞正的人才，決不能循情隨便派幾個人，來濫竽充數。這樣的一個經濟研究機關，相信友邦先進的經濟硏究機關，必能寄以同情而予以協力。</p>
<p>最後，經濟研究有組織的工作，實在不是一件容易的事，因爲硏究少不了調查，而調查人才正缺乏的當前，不得不借重於多數專家學者的羣策羣力。但，全國經濟委員會必須訂定一個完密的經濟硏究計劃，必要時，供給他們以參考的資料，使他們得到正確的研究方針，俾將其研究結果，貢獻國家常局審核採納。依此完密與通盤的經濟計釗而出發，那就不會發生資力，勞力，和時間上的浪費了。</p>

        <h1>1943.06.07</h1>
<h3>The Silent Europe</h3>
<p>The war situation in Europe, from the Mediterranean to the German-Soviet battlefields, is, strictly speaking, at a standstill on land, with only fierce air battles breaking the silence before the storm. However, no matter what, the days of silence will not last long. "All trees are silent, waiting for the rain." Perhaps Europeans today have this solemn psychology?</p>
<p>However, the evolution of the European situation is frantically unfolding in this temporary silence. In politics and mobilization, both sides are engaged in extremely fierce battles. And this non-military battle will be a crucial deciding force in the future war situation.</p>
<p>Since the recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, although the propaganda of the anti-Axis powers "invading Europe" has been clamorous, it is actually the beginning of a war of nerves. If they have any so-called offensive, it is only a political activity. What is most noteworthy is the announcement of the dissolution of the Communist International on the 22nd of last month. This is to ease the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and to eliminate the fear of the Red Peril among the small and neutral countries in Europe, and to promote closer ties with the anti-Axis powers. These were originally just the judgments of a few people, but now Stalin has automatically revealed them in his four points in response to questions from Reuters reporters. However, this is only one party's attempt, and the outcome is still hard to say. Roosevelt's special envoy, Davies, has returned to the United States with Stalin's reply, and there are probably many more topics to discuss between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Secondly, what can demonstrate the new activities of the anti-Axis powers is the promotion of a compromise between the French splinter faction, the "Fighting France" faction (close to Britain) led by de Gaulle, and Giraud, who succeeded Darlan and seized French Northwest Africa (close to the United States). De Gaulle and Giraud recently held a meeting in Algiers, and with the joint efforts of Britain and the United States, they have established the so-called "French Committee of National Liberation" as the central political power organization of the French anti-Axis faction. This is a concession by Giraud under the support of the United States. At the same time, de Gaulle also sacrificed some of the original institutions of "Fighting France" and incorporated them into the "Committee of National Liberation." De Gaulle and Giraud declared in the name of this committee that they would insist on the "national restoration" war, willing to be driven by Britain and the United States. This seems to be another triumphant puppet show by Britain and the United States. Of course, everyone "dreams different dreams," and the future is not worth much attention. However, what is noteworthy is that from now on, the French fleet in Alexandria and Algeria, including one dreadnought, three 10,000-ton cruisers, one 7,000-ton cruiser, and several torpedo boats, have been incorporated into the enemy British and American camps. This is valued by every Frenchman.</p>
<p>Again, it is to extend the magic hand of conspiracy to neutral countries. The main thing, in addition to diplomatic and economic conspiracies, is to instigate coups and launch so-called "revolutionary" incidents. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Argentina, the only neutral country in South America, which has always resisted the threats from the United States and continued to maintain normal diplomatic and trade relations with the Axis powers, actually experienced a so-called "revolution" on the 4th of this month under the instigation of the United States. The pro-American Minister of National Defense, General Ramírez, threatened some Argentine legions and important military officers, General Donaz and General Rosen, and forced Argentine President Castillo to acknowledge four demands: (1) change the neutral policy, (2) cooperation among the American countries, (3) freedom of election, and (4) reorganization of politics. Obviously, all of these are exactly what the United States has always sought from Argentina but failed to obtain. Now the rebels have established a revolutionary government. A dispatch from Stockholm on the 5th even stated: "Argentina is about to join the anti-Axis camp, sever relations with the Axis powers, and join the war." Here, we should be vigilant. The fifth columns of Britain and the United States may also appear in European and even Middle Eastern countries, and the so-called "second Darlan" is also stirring.</p>
<p>In terms of strategy, Churchill went to Gibraltar and also held meetings in Algiers and Tunis with General Eisenhower, commander of the U.S. Allied forces in North Africa, as well as General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, General Alexander, commander of the First Army, and the French Giraud and de Gaulle, to discuss and plan for future strategies and tactics. In military terms, the so-called "air offensive" is almost already being launched on a larger scale. However, can it be inferred from these situations that Britain and the United States already have the strength to launch an offensive against Europe? In our opinion, Britain and the United States are still hesitant, as admitted by Mr. Scobel, a military reporter for the Washington Daily, in a dispatch from Lisbon on the 4th (see newspapers on the 5th). The anti-Axis powers currently have eight major problems that urgently need to be solved, namely (1) the Soviet front. He said that this is the largest land battlefield, including most of the air force, and urgently needs the supply of British and American materials; (2) the Western European problem, including the joint use of land, sea, and air forces to invade Europe; (3) the bombing of Germany and Italy, including the establishment of a huge air force and close cooperation with the land, sea, and air forces; (4) dealing with the submarine threat, including the use of powerful fighters and aircraft; (5) the Pacific battlefield. The strength of the Japanese navy is strong, and this problem also urgently needs to be resolved; (6) the combat power of Chongqing must be made active, but Chongqing has less wartime production than the Soviet Union and suffers greater damage; (7) the longer Japan holds its occupied territories, the harder it will be to defeat; (8) the Pacific War cannot be considered won until Japan is subjected to bombing and artillery shelling by the anti-Axis forces and the trampling of the anti-Axis armies. The eight points pointed out by Scobel are exactly the most unsolvable problems for the anti-Axis powers at present, and they are also the places where the Axis powers maintain their advantages.</p>
<p>Conversely, on the Axis side, facing the most serious situation of world war, they maintain calm, composure, and solemnity. In fact, for the Axis powers, there is absolutely no need to shout propaganda, hold a series of large and small meetings, or carry out nerve war actions. In the current and future wars, the forces that determine victory are mainly: first, maintaining air supremacy over the Mediterranean and Western Europe. With Italy's geographical advantage in the Mediterranean and the consolidation of the defensive measures of the German and Italian armies in southern France, there is no need to worry about the southern battlefield. As for Western and Northern Europe, if Britain and the United States want to land, concentrating the full power of the land, sea, and air forces on a front of hundreds or even thousands of miles, this small base in the three islands, coupled with the power of the Axis submarine warfare, can hardly support the resupply after penetrating deep. Moreover, Britain's own supply capacity is limited, and the United States is still far away across the Atlantic. Second, the main battlefield that will determine the future war is still the German-Soviet battlefield on the Eastern Front. Obviously, in recent months, both sides have been preparing, but the goals of this preparation are clearly different. On the Soviet side, rather than preparing to attack, it is better to say that they are preparing to defend. Their best strategy is to delay time, get through the summer and autumn, and postpone until winter. At that time, after more than half a year of preparation, using the advantages of the seasons and the terrain, they may launch an offensive to seek victory. However, clearly, Germany will not let the Soviet Union make such wishful calculations. In Germany, until today, the importance attached to the Eastern Front has always exceeded all other fronts, and launching a summer offensive in a timely manner can be said to occupy the first position. After a fairly long period of silence, Germany will no longer allow the Soviet Union to prepare calmly. Now, the fierce air battles in the Kuban region have already begun, and summer is approaching day by day. The large-scale offensive by the German army cannot wait much longer. Third, the attitude of the small countries in Europe, especially the attitude of the neutral countries, which mainly includes Turkey, has a decisive impact on the future war situation. The ambiguity of Turkey can only be maintained for fewer and fewer days. Since Spain's peace proposal was rejected, it has been preparing for action when war comes. The southeastern Balkan Peninsula, the northeastern Scandinavian Peninsula, and the countries along the Atlantic coast are all preparing for a bloody anti-aggression war. And fourth, within the anti-Axis powers, especially within the United States, starting with the general strike of coal miners, the waves of anti-government sentiment and unrest aroused by high prices are boiling. From the various departments of the munitions production industry to the administrative departments, they are encountering crises. In addition, the United States in the Pacific is constantly suffering serious blows. All of these are holding back their second step of action; at the same time, they are also giving the Axis powers an opportunity for further counterattacks.</p>
<p>Europe is on the eve of a decisive battle. The Axis powers, with calm and solemn minds, are waiting for work in ease, preparing for a head-on blow of victory.</p>
<h3>The Scene of Moscow on the Eve of a Storm</h3>
<p>— Special Telegram from Moscow Correspondent Hatanaka of the Asahi Shimbun, June 1st</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Moscow for a month and departed for Kubyshev today. During this month, the area where the future German-Soviet summer war will take place is peaceful and without war. Only in the southern area, the German air force repeatedly bombed railway lines and wartime strongholds. During the reporter's stay in Moscow, I not only did not hear a single air raid alarm, but I simply did not feel the existence of a war that directly threatened the peaceful lives of the citizens. In our memory, the roads leading to Moscow two years ago were densely covered with tank trenches and fortresses to defend the capital. The situation at that time is still vividly in our minds, but today, revisiting the old place, the tank trenches and fortresses at that time have completely turned into citizen farms, which is quite unexpected.</p>
<p>The popularity of these citizen farms has become an important issue in Moscow today. The authorities are planning to promote the development of such farms by individuals or groups. Now the citizens of Moscow are dividing the roads and streets from the suburbs to the city into agricultural land for cultivation. The Moscow Evening News answered the naive questions of citizens regarding the operation of these citizen farms. For example, questions from amateur gardeners such as "When can potatoes be planted?" "Can't potatoes be planted on rainy days?" "Can the space between potato plantings be used for other purposes?" Bookstores are lined with people vying to buy monographs and pamphlets on gardening works. These citizen farms, which can be seen everywhere in the city, are said to number more than three thousand three hundred and forty-nine in total, with high-rise buildings that are conspicuous like Gorky Street surrounded by agricultural countries. This is because citizens have suffered from a lack of vegetables in the past three winters, so they have started this activity to seek self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Another distress for the citizens of Moscow is the lack of firewood. Now, the streets of Moscow are filled with trams and cars loaded with wood, which can be seen everywhere. It can be seen that they are preparing for a rainy day to prepare for the coming winter. Traffic in the city and suburbs is strictly controlled, and citizens living in suburban villas also need special permission to enter the city. The subway operates until 7:30 pm. General traffic is prohibited after 12 o'clock, which is the same as before. Most of the theaters close at 11 pm, and the parks stop opening at 10:30 pm. The signs indicating bomb shelters that were seen in Moscow in the first few months of the war have now become indicators of gas defense rooms. On the walls of the theater, it is written: "If an air raid alarm is issued, the performance will be immediately suspended, and the audience should go to the nearest gas defense room or subway station for refuge." This announcement proves that Moscow is still under the air raid of German planes. The air defense posture to prepare for the German planes is not slack, and they continue to be alert with tension. In the dark, hazy air, barrier balloons float quietly. The scene of the German-Soviet war in Moscow is the calm before the storm. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun on June 3)</p>

<h3>Yu Army Lunan Commander-in-Chief Rong Ziheng Leads His Troops to Surrender, Issues a Statement Leaving the Yu Side to Join the Peace Movement, Yu Xuezhong's Lunan Base Will Be Completely Lost</h3>
<p>Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency) According to a mine in a certain front line in Shandong, Rong Ziheng, lieutenant general, commander-in-chief of the "Lunan Command of the Lu-Su War Zone" of the Yu army, resolutely left the Yu side with 20,000 elite troops on the 6th to join the peace movement. He telegraphed the whole country at 11:00 am today and issued a statement to participate in the peace. Since Wu Huawen, commander of the New Fourth Division, first led his troops to join the peace movement on January 18th this year, Han Zigan, commander of the 113th Division, Li Wenli, commander of the Second Forwarding Column, and Li Yingping, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, also left the Yu side one after another to join the peace movement. This dealt a fatal blow to Yu Xuezhong, weakening the Yu army's power in the Lu-Su War Zone. This time, Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng resolutely returned, so Yu Xuezhong's base in Lunan will be completely lost. The 112th Division and 113th Division under the command of Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng were all pure old Northeastern army troops, and they were direct descendants of Zhang Xueliang. This time, Rong realized that the war of resistance not only failed to contribute to the revitalization of China, but also plunged the people into deep water and dire straits. He was also moved by Japan's withdrawal of extraterritorial rights in China. He deeply felt that only by realizing peace and cooperating with Japan could China be revitalized, so he resolutely joined the peace movement. This action of General Rong has caused great turmoil among the Northeastern generals. The old Northeastern army's forces account for about 80% of the Yu army's front-line camp. The main generals are Ma Zhanshan, Fu Zuoyi, He Zhuguo, Wan Fulin, Han Deqin, Yu Xuezhong, etc. Therefore, the departure of these generals is a fatal blow to the Yu army. Yu Jiang is now trying to suppress this situation with all his might, which shows the wavering situation of the old Northeastern army.</p>
<p>Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency) According to a mine in a certain front line in Shandong, after Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng decided to join the peace movement, he visited the commander of a certain Japanese army unit at 10:00 am on the 6th, accompanied by Major General Sun Mengti and others. After clarifying his determination to join the peace movement, he issued a statement and telegraphed the whole country at 11:00 am. Rong and others will also visit relevant Chinese agencies and the Japanese Army Liaison Department and the Military Police Corps separately.</p>
<p>(Another telegram) Lieutenant General Rong Ziheng, who left the Yu side and resolutely joined the peace movement, is 39 years old this year and a native of Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Engineering Department of the Japanese Army Academy. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Japanese Army Infantry School. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Japanese Army Engineering School again. After returning to China, he successively served as an instructor at the Northeast Army Lecture Hall, guard captain of the Fengtian Northeast Commander's Office (lieutenant colonel), guard captain of the Beijing Northeast Commander's Office (colonel), commander of the Fourth Regiment of the 105th Division, and commander of the Communications Battalion of the Beijing Military Commission Branch. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he was promoted to deputy brigade commander of the 112th Division (major general). In the 31st year of the Republic of China, he took office as commander-in-chief of the Lunan Headquarters and deputy commander of the 112th Division (lieutenant general) from the commander of the 334th Brigade, until today. Rong Zhen, the respected father of Lieutenant General Rong, currently lives in Beijing. He is a veteran of the old Northeastern Army. During Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Frontier Defense Commander era, he served as the Chief of Staff. Now he lives in seclusion in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Details of the Ceremony for the Takeover of the French Concession in Shameen</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) Since the friendly nation Japan has practiced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of the special concessions, the French government also respects the friendly relations between China and France and has made the same statement as our National Government. Therefore, on May 17th of this year, the detailed clauses for the implementation of the return of the special concessions in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou were formally signed in Nanjing, and it was decided to practice the return of the special concessions in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou on the 5th of this month. Our National Government has separately appointed commissioners for the takeover of the French concessions. The commissioner for the takeover of the French concession in Shameen in this province was also specially appointed by the National Government to be Governor Chen. After receiving the order, Governor Chen immediately carried out preparations and held a takeover ceremony at the French concession in Shameen on the 5th. Those who participated in the grand ceremony that day included Governor Chen and the heads of various departments and military and political officers on our side, the French Consul Xie Meng stationed in Guangzhou on the French side, and the Japanese, German, and Italian consuls general, the Danish and Swedish consuls, the Portuguese vice-consul, and many senior officers of the Japanese army and navy on the side of the guests. At 10:00 am, to the sound of melodious music, the officials and guests entered the venue in an orderly manner. Chen, the takeover commissioner on our side, and French Consul Xie Meng, the representative of the French side, took their seats. First, the French consul delivered a speech, followed by Chen, the takeover commissioner on our side, delivering a reply. After the speeches, the takeover representatives of China and France exchanged salutes. The entire venue was filled with a friendly and warm atmosphere. The French flag was slowly lowered to the sound of the French national anthem played by the band. Then, the flag-raising ceremony of our country was held. At that time, the band played the Chinese national anthem. In the majestic and melodious music, everyone stood in salute. The glorious and solemn blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag fluttered high in the sky, symbolizing the bright and brilliant future of our country. All participants were infinitely excited. At about 11:00 am, the historical takeover ceremony of the French concession in Shameen was successfully completed. The following is the speech of the French consul:</p>
<p>The French Consul's Speech</p>
<p>I respectfully accept the declaration of the French government on March 23rd and, in accordance with the agreement signed in Nanjing on May 17th, hereby return the French concession in Shameen to your country. This consul deeply believes that this move by the French government will not only increase the friendly friendship that has always existed between the peoples of China and France, but will also satisfy the people of your country. This consul is honored to attend this grand ceremony.</p>
<p>Governor Chen's speech Governor Chen also said in his speech: I have been ordered by the National Government to take over the French special concession in Shameen, Guangzhou. I am very happy to hold the takeover ceremony in Shameen today. The existence of concessions in China has a great impact on the integrity of a country's sovereignty and political development, which is recognized by all countries in the world. This year, the friendly nation Japan took the lead in abolishing extraterritorial rights and returning special concessions to China, and assisted China in recovering the British and American special concessions. Since then, Germany and Italy have also advocated it. This proves that international justice remains unchanged. Your country also issued a statement on March 23rd this year abandoning extraterritorial rights in China and returning special concessions. After several sincere consultations with our National Government, it was fully realized today. This shows that your country maintains justice and has full enthusiasm for promoting Sino-French relations and understanding the new East Asian situation. Moreover, the time distance between the statement on March 23rd and today's implementation is very short, which shows your country's sincerity in sympathizing with us and the diplomatic spirit of acting on what it says. I admire it very much. The French concession in Shameen, Guangzhou, has a history of eighty-two years since it was designated in 1861. Today, it is returned to our country for takeover, which is a grand event to enhance Sino-French friendship. The friendship between China and France has always been very close, and the enthusiasm of the people of China and France has always been harmonious. In the future, we must take this return of the special concession by your country as an opportunity to further enhance friendly institutions. I wish our two countries will forever maintain our friendly friendship, increase our well-being, and develop our national fortunes.</p>

Manchurian Major General Liu stated, "Traveling through the highway between Medan and Palembang in Sumatra, I felt the greatness of the Japanese military's achievements. Seeing it firsthand is even more impressive than hearing about it. The peaceful and prosperous lives of the local residents are no different from those in present-day Manchuria. The residents' active cooperation with the Japanese military clearly demonstrates their love and respect for Japan." Thai Major General Chiuthek stated, "The inspection group was warmly welcomed everywhere, and we are very grateful. We inspected several battle sites and heard about the war situation, which further proves the strength and excellent training of the Japanese military. Java has the most abundant resources and population in the Southern regions. The residents are now living in peace and prosperity, and security has been established, making it truly a paradise of the Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>

He arrived in Fukuoka at 2:00 PM on the 5th and delivered the following remarks: The recent implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, including the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, has had a positive impact on the Chinese side. Before returning to Japan, I inspected North and Central China and witnessed that the Chinese people in various places highly valued the Japanese side's implementation of the new policy and were diligently fulfilling their duties, which was very gratifying. The new policy is not limited to the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights but also has significant implications for assisting China's recovery in economic and livelihood aspects. Therefore, this work is only just beginning. Marshal Yamamoto's martyrdom and the belief of Chairman Wang and the Chinese people that the Greater East Asia War will be won through this spirit, along with their great courage to persevere in the victory of the war, are deeply appreciated.</p>
<h3>Overview of Economic Construction in Various Southern Regions: Actively Developing Resources and Striving for Production, Demonstrating the Spirit of Solidarity among Eastern Nations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Economic construction, including the development of resources and the strengthening of war capabilities within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has already achieved great results, and a solid foundation for the strategic posture of the Co-Prosperity Sphere has been laid. As the enemy clamors for a counterattack, the construction work in Greater East Asia is becoming increasingly active. Here is a summary of the recent construction status in various Southern regions:</p>
<p>Philippines: The people of the Philippines have increasingly hoped for Philippine independence due to the successive visits of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia. They have also gained a deeper understanding of the Japanese government's sincere desire to assist the Philippines in achieving independence, and their will to cooperate with Japan has become even stronger. The Philippine administrative authorities recognize that establishing economic self-sufficiency for the Philippines is the most important condition for Philippine independence. Therefore, they have previously implemented a five-year food plan and, with the cooperation of various state governments and the Philippine Service Corps, have convened food production increase coordination meetings in various places, achieving great results. At the same time, the expansion of rice purchasing organizations and the improvement of distribution organizations have also made great progress. Plans for self-sufficiency in daily necessities other than food have also been established, such as plans to increase the production of clothing by utilizing locally produced cotton, ramie, Manila hemp, and other textiles, and the establishment of production facilities for this purpose is currently underway. In addition, various light industrial factories have been added, such as paper, match, soap, soda, electrical appliance, and monosodium glutamate factories. Since then, the Philippine economic self-sufficiency system has been on the right track and is developing daily.</p>
<p>Malaya: Based on the basic policy of establishing a self-sufficiency system, Malaya has begun to implement measures to increase food production, strengthen industrial production, and adjust the rubber industry. Regarding food production increase, in addition to increasing rice production, there are also plans to increase the production of millet, corn, and other coarse grains. The Taiwanese-produced Penglai rice, which has been test-planted at various agricultural experimental farms, has been successful. The authorities also plan to import coarse grains from Java and are considering importing rice from Burma for adjustment. Regarding rubber, the Japanese military confiscated approximately 1.7 million acres of enemy rubber plantations in Malaya and Sumatra. Forty percent of these plantations have been entrusted to private management, while the remaining sixty percent are directly managed by the military administration, with the principle of temporarily suspending production. However, because rubber is the source of livelihood for the indigenous people, it is planned to purchase a considerable amount to provide relief. At the same time, approximately 620,000 indigenous people in Malaya have lost their jobs due to the conversion to other crops. The authorities have decided that 50-60% of these people will be reassigned to increase food production or establish businesses. Therefore, on the one hand, the labor problem has been adjusted, and on the other hand, food production has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>Java: Agricultural gardens and transportation facilities throughout Java have been restored to their former appearance. In order to adapt to the situation, the authorities have established a conversion department in cultivation enterprises, management parks, etc., to manage the conversion and production of agricultural products. For materials currently in overproduction, such as tea, coffee, rubber, silk, and cotton trees, the needs within the Co-Prosperity Sphere and other areas will be reviewed, and partial processing will be carried out separately. For example, tea gardens will be converted to grow cinchona bark, acacia, ramie, etc., and some coffee gardens will be cultivated with cocoa (Diris, name of tropical plants), pyrethrum and other insecticidal raw material plants. In addition, increasing cotton production has been effective, and Java's cinchona bark, which originally accounted for 98% of the world's output, is also being actively increased in production. The authorities are also seeking to rapidly increase the number of Japanese technical experts and, therefore, established a Japanese technical personnel training institute in Bogor Province on May 20th. Furthermore, as in Sumatra, unemployed farmers and workers in Java have been reassigned to other occupations and the process is proceeding smoothly, which is a major success of the authorities' administration. The above-mentioned economic situation in various Southern regions is only a general overview. Although the anti-Axis side recognizes that Japan is mobilizing the resources of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase its war capabilities, they all ignore the solidarity in the spirit of the Greater East Asian nations. The various nations within the Co-Prosperity Sphere no longer distinguish between each other. They all have a deep understanding of the true meaning of this war and are striving to overcome any difficulties and jointly fight for the independence and freedom of the East Asian nations. The smooth progress of economic construction in the South with the cooperation of the indigenous people is the best proof of this, and it is something that the anti-Axis countries should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Guagarda, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The military administration in this area has decided to establish a sugar industry association to revive the sugar industry in Java. A notice was issued on the 5th stating that the purpose of establishing the sugar industry association is to promote the healthy development of the sugar industry in Java and to manage the factories, agricultural parks, facilities, and products of the sugar industry and its related businesses. It also stipulates a production plan, cultivation methods to promote the sugar industry, and new industries based on the sugar industry, aiming to make Java the largest sugar-producing area in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Celebes: Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Taipei telephone report: Okada Fumihide, the Chief of the Civilian Government of the Japanese Navy in Celebes, returned to Japan by plane yesterday to request instructions from the central government. He passed through here on the 4th and said, regarding the current construction status in Celebes and Southern Borneo, that the first task to be undertaken in Celebes is the development of the mining industry and the foundation of modern industry. Recently, the increase in the production of iron, tin, nickel, etc., has been progressing very smoothly, and the reserves of coal necessary for the smelting plant are also very abundant. Therefore, the development of the local steel industry and non-spy light industry is essential. As for this year's cotton production, it is expected to be good due to proper guidance and the cooperation of local residents, and the establishment of textile factories is possible soon. In terms of rice, the soil in Celebes and Borneo is not fertile, so it is necessary to select appropriate rice varieties and seek self-sufficiency in fertilizers to strengthen production. In the old Dutch East Indies era, coconut production was considerable, and it is now planned to extract coconut oil for food, and soap factories are also planned to be established. The authorities also plan to add a comprehensive research institute to the civil government to develop the local area using modern scientific methods. In short, all construction work in Celebes and Borneo is progressing very smoothly due to the enthusiastic assistance of local residents.</p>
<h3>Professor Speer Explains the Current State of German War Production</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German Armaments Minister Professor Speer delivered a speech at the National Socialist Party rally here yesterday, revealing accurate figures for Germany's armament and ammunition production. He said that since 1942, armament production has doubled, reaching a new record figure. Moreover, as a result of future production processes, there may be even greater increases. Since the spring of 1942, heavy tanks, various anti-aircraft guns, and other armaments, such as naval mines and aircraft, have all seen significant increases. The production of anti-tank armaments has increased tenfold, the production of artillery above 3.7-inch caliber has increased by 400%, the production of anti-aircraft guns has tripled, and Germany's most famous flat-trajectory guns have also increased by 200%. Last year, many new types of aircraft were invented and have been added to the German Air Force. The total production of aircraft has increased several times compared to the previous year. As for the situation of raw materials, the production of coal, iron, and steel has all seen significant increases, and aluminum, magnesium, chromium, manganese, and other metals are also sufficient for application. Germany's armaments industry, fortunately due to well-planned dispersal in advance, is relatively unafraid of air raids, and Germany's production power is constantly increasing. The transportation situation on the German side is very satisfactory, and new locomotives are being built to continue to improve it. The use of wood and other substitutes for gasoline saves fuel equivalent to the establishment of several large-scale synthetic gasoline factories. The number of workers employed in the armaments industry has increased by 23% within a year, and the exchange of production experience between industries has saved a lot of manpower and materials. The two sluice gates recently destroyed by British air raids do not affect armaments production, and the water supply in the Ruhr region is only slightly affected temporarily. In the future, the German armaments industry will continue to add workers and has established new factories to massively produce armaments. Moreover, the inventive genius of the Germans is constantly researching the creation of new weapons and the improvement of old armaments.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Casualties</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>According to Washington news: The U.S. Army and Navy Departments reported an additional 2,271 U.S. military casualties last week. The Army Department reported 1,299, including 251 wounded, 179 missing, and 869 captured. The Navy Department announced 21 deaths, 12 wounded, and 48 missing.</p>
<h3>British Envoy to the Holy See Postpones Return</h3>
<p>Vatican, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Reuters News Agency learned yesterday that the British envoy to the Holy See, Sir Osborne, will not be able to return to the Vatican next week. He has notified his secretary here that he must postpone his return for another ten days.</p>

<h3>Pétain Delivers Speech Clarifying France's Attitude: Insisting on Neutrality and Committing to National Reconstruction, Continuing to Supply Labor by Fulfilling Agreements</h3>
<p>Paris, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Marshal Pétain, when interviewed by a reporter from the Petit Parisien on the 4th, reiterated France's attitude, saying, "I am determined to shoulder the heavy responsibility of reviving France to the end and will not be swayed by any changes. The only task for the French people at present is to faithfully implement France's established national policy. France is bearing the responsibility of rescuing the world, ignoring this fact and attempting to place the responsibility on other countries. Regarding the recent indiscriminate bombing of French cities by the British and American air forces, the bombing of innocent people in non-belligerent countries is an inhumane act." This statement by Marshal Pétain can be regarded as a reaffirmation that the French government, regardless of the events in North Africa, will still stand on the Axis side and adhere to the policy of neutrality.</p>
<p>Vichy, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – French Premier Laval delivered a radio broadcast to the entire French territory on the evening of the 5th, pointing out the crisis currently facing France and strongly urging the French people to continue to cooperate with the Axis powers and strive to revive their homeland. The gist of his speech was: The French government will not change its friendly relations with Germany and Italy in the slightest. In the future, it will double its cooperation with the two countries and strive to secure its appropriate position in Europe. This war was caused by those who oppose maintaining friendly relations with Germany and Italy. Now, Germany and Italy are shedding blood to defeat communism, and France is assisting by supplying labor. Recently, Germany and France have reached an agreement stipulating that from April 1st to July 1st, France will supply 250,000 workers to Germany. This is the result of my meeting with German Chancellor Hitler, who decided that France should more actively supply labor to Germany. To cope with this situation, it has been decided to conscript all able-bodied men of 1943. Those who evade conscription will be severely punished by the government according to law. Workers in Germany receive the same treatment as French workers. They have fulfilled their due obligations to restore their homeland. I hope that the people of our country will unite and rise up, and then there will be hope for the restoration of the homeland.</p>
<h3>Voice of Scientific Victory (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The victory of war is the victory of science. Enthusiasm for science has become widespread in both the front lines and the rear. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese scientific community has made unprecedented and astonishing progress in various weapons and aircraft. However, as the nature of combat becomes more profound, the battle between science and science, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, also becomes more intense. To achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War, this not only requires combat but also requires a scientific war to defeat Britain and the United States and make them unconditionally submit. The victory of science is very spectacular. But this is definitely not something that can be achieved in a day or two. Instead, it requires round-the-clock, squeezing of pus, forgetting to eat and sleep, and years of diligent research before it can be won. Now we are going to talk about some of the research results that the people in the scientific community have already obtained, so as to provide reference for the revitalization of science tomorrow. Let's first take a look at the hard work of scientists published at the 10th-anniversary commemorative lecture of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rice Spreads Throughout East Asia, Unafraid of Heat, Disease, and Insect Pests</h3>
<p>There is an absolutely inseparable and close relationship between the 100 million people in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and their staple food, rice. Rice, only rice, is the source of strength for the East Asian nation, and only rice is the life element of the East Asian nation. Only rice can cultivate the basic vitality of the people who will bear the burden of the Co-Prosperity Sphere tomorrow. However, generally speaking, rice has a wide variety of species, and its performance and form are also very different. But among these countless varieties, the ones that guide agricultural rice growers in East Asia are Japanese rice. Japanese varieties have outstanding performance in both scientific and practical aspects. The harvest is several times greater than that of Southern varieties, and the new Japanese varieties, formed by combining Japanese varieties with Southern varieties, are heat-resistant and insect-resistant. These are transported to various places in the South, so that the rice source of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is constantly increased, so that the food problem of enhancing war power can be absolutely guaranteed. Scientific research targeting the rice of the entire East Asian land must be developed more and more in the future. The discovery of the world-renowned Luyu No. 132 rice has made a great contribution to Japan's food problem. Temple tail Hakuno Dr. of Agriculture, authority of five grains and Chang of the agricultural trial of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chang of the Agricultural Institute of Tokyo Imperial University, and the recent author of "Rice and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Group", now let's take a little look.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Group has its own characteristics in terms of ethnic relations, climate, industry, etc., compared to other regions. However, the biggest feature is rice. Rice cultivation accounts for a large part of the world's rice, and it is all in the East Asian region. The East Asian people rely on this staple food, rice, for survival. The East Asian people prosper and grow together with rice. This is well known. However, although there are major exporting countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, and Annam in the Greater East Asia Group, there are also non-exporting countries. Today in wartime, each region in East Asia must be self-sufficient in rice. This goes without saying. Although it is convenient to say a word of increasing production, in reality it is to give technical and scientific aspects a great difficulty price. What variety should be used to fill the difficulty? Which varieties are most suitable for the South? Which variety harvests more and is resistant to insects and heat? These are the necessary objects to study in the rice of the East Asia Circle.</p>
<p>For the Japanese, whenever "rice" is mentioned, Japanese rice must appear in their minds. However, among rice, there is a complete system. For example, if you look at the rice in China, Thailand, Myanmar and other places, it has obvious differences from Japanese rice in all aspects. For example, rice imported into Japan, whether in terms of taste, nature, or luster, has great differences from Japanese rice. This is something that anyone can see at a glance. But in fact, there are also fundamental differences, even in the egg cells and pollen between Japanese rice and Southern rice. Generally speaking, Southern rice is taller, averaging five to six feet, and the tallest floating rice is even four meters high. And its stems are very thick. Japanese rice is very short, only about four feet. From this point, we can also know that the stem of Southern rice is heavier than the total, and the ear part usually accounts for only 20-30%. The Japanese rice ear accounts for more than 50%. At the same time, the stem quality of Southern rice is quite rough and fragile. The Japanese rice stalk can be used as mats and ropes, while the Southern rice stalk is almost useless. The Japanese pull out the roots at harvest, while the Southern only cut off the ears without moving the stalks. In the next planting, they let it rot in the field as fertilizer.</p>
<p>Let's compare the harvest of Southern rice and Japanese rice. The average yield of Southern rice is 5斗 per segment (Japanese field unit, equivalent to 992 sq m), and 1石 is the best result. And sometimes there are disasters such as drought and water, so in reality the average yield is only more than 3斗. In Japan, the statistical figures average more than 2石 per segment, and ordinary harvests are often 4石, and the best harvests are often as high as 6石. This is because Japan uses fertilizer to increase the growth of rice. Then, will it have a good effect if fertilizer is applied to Southern varieties? If people who don’t eat rice force him to eat rice, then they will only spoil their stomachs. Similarly, Southern rice and Japanese rice have different systems, so if the fertilizer used for Japanese rice is given to Southern rice, it will only grow its stems taller, and the rice itself will become weak, so it often falls down.</p>
<p>Then what if the Japanese rice varieties with the highest harvest are transplanted to the South? Then Japanese rice will suffer greatly from diseases and insect pests. Then why is it that Japanese rice is excellent, but it is damaged instead? This is because Japanese rice has the biggest shortcoming: it is not resistant to insects and heat. Therefore, I thought of breeding strong Japanese rice with insect-resistant and heat-resistant Southern rice. On this condition, we must also consider the example of hybrids in animals, such as mules which are hybrids of horses and donkeys, but mules have the deficiency of being unable to reproduce, so we must design how to make up for this deficiency. Few of the mixed rice ears are solid, and most of them are almost chaff, and it can even be said that there is no harvest at all. It is necessary to prevent this reduction in reproductive power. Regarding this issue, many technical difficulties arise. Therefore, this research began in various places and received a wholehearted response. Science! Science! Science can overcome all difficulties and make the impossible possible. Soon, a large amount of excellent Japanese rice varieties will be planted in the South, and the rice business will increase at least fourfold. Perhaps such a day is not far away!

<h3>Argentina Restores Provisional Government Announces Establishment: Strict Measures will be taken in Internal Affairs; Foreign Policy will remain unchanged</h3>
<p>Argentina Capital, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Argentine new President General Lawson has organized a new cabinet on the 5th, and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 6th.</p>
<p>Argentina Capital, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to the Reuters News Agency, the lineup of the Argentine government was officially announced last night as follows: President General Lawson, Vice President Rear Admiral Suelo, Minister of Interior Rear Admiral Storni, Minister of Foreign Affairs General Matinays, Minister of Agriculture General Mason, Minister of Public Works General Bisterlini, Minister of Finance Rosa, Minister of Navy Rear Admiral Suelo, Minister of Justice Calderon, Minister of Defense General Ramirez. Except for two members, all cabinet members are military figures.</p>
<p>Argentina Capital, 6th (Telegram) – According to the Reuters News Agency, responsible persons here said that the new Argentine government will take strict measures in internal affairs, but the foreign policy will remain unchanged. The government will issue a proclamation in the near future detailing its goals and plans. The arrest of former Minister of Interior Kraciti and former Minister of Agriculture Vitaira is a clear indication of the government's determination to take all necessary measures. The Police Department has also ordered the monitoring of the Communist Party to prevent rebellious activities.</p>
<p>Argentina Capital, 6th (Member) – According to the Reuters News Agency, the first proclamation of the Argentine provisional government was not signed and only stated that it would fulfill its international obligations. Military leaders who led the revolution declared that political parties did not participate in this movement, and the government did not receive political leaders. This movement was purely military in nature and was directed against the corruption of political parties. It can be regarded as a purely domestic issue rather than a result of foreign pressure.</p>
<h3>President-Elect Ah Sin Issues Inaugural Telegram</h3>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, General Luo Sun, leader of the Argentine revolution, issued an inaugural telegram stating: "Following this incident, I have today assumed leadership of the Argentine government's military movement. Please take note that until the necessary measures required to achieve the objectives of this movement are announced, I request that you implement all steps to ensure public order and security are not disrupted. [Signed] General Luo Sun."</p>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, the new Argentine President, General Luo Sun, is fifty-eight years old. He entered military school at the age of seventeen and, after completing initial training, joined the cavalry. He participated in the Chaco War under the command of Rosas Teno and O'Donnell. At thirty-six, he joined the General Staff. In 1927, he was stationed in La Paz as a military attaché. In 1930, he returned home and was appointed Principal of the Cavalry School. In 1934, he was transferred to be Commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment. Three years later, he became Director of the Civil Service Bureau. In 1938, he was appointed Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division and promoted to general. With the success of the Argentine revolution, General Luo Sun entered Argentine political life on Friday, assuming the office of President.</p>
<h3>Castillo Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, former Argentine President Castillo telegraphed General Luo Sun from La Plata, stating: "Military Commander, I hereby tender my resignation from the positions I previously held. [Signed] Castillo."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital, the Argentine revolutionary government officially announced: President Castillo, along with the Minister of Interior and the Minister of the Navy, boarded the minesweeper "Doramun" and arrived at the port of La Balata, south of the Argentine capital, at noon on the 5th. They were subsequently arrested there by revolutionary forces and taken to the capital. He has now resigned from the presidency. According to a broadcast from the Argentine capital radio station, which is under the control of the revolutionary forces, President Castillo and his cabinet resigned en masse on the 5th. Dr. Castillo signed the resignation and was immediately released.</p>
<h3>Causes and Consequences of the Revolution</h3>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, recent news from the revolutionary party indicates that the cause of the Argentine military coup was the nomination of Costaes as presidential candidate by the National Democratic Party. Costaes was a staunch supporter of President Castillo and his neutral policy, so his nomination was strongly opposed by the military. Defense Minister Ramirez and other army officers failed to persuade President Castillo to withdraw Costaes' nomination, as the Argentine constitution stipulates that the president has no responsibility to interfere in this matter. President Castillo then ordered the dismissal of Defense Minister Ramirez, appointing General Marquis as his successor. Therefore, the military sent a representative to President Castillo, issuing an ultimatum demanding a response before 10:00 AM on Friday. The President had no choice but to board the minesweeper "Doramun" with his cabinet. At the same time, revolutionary elements on the warship took over the government. The revolutionary elements were led by Generals Ramirez, Luo Sun, and Ferrer, and Rear Admiral Su Yiluo. When General Luo Sun marched into the Argentine capital, reporters asked if the revolutionary movement would cooperate with political parties. He replied, "We are all Argentinians, and there is no distinction between political parties." This statement was a bolt from the blue for the Radical Party and nationalists who believed the revolutionary movement would benefit them. However, the fundamental principles of the revolutionary movement are still awaited by all parties. The police's prohibition of government party meetings every minute demonstrates that this revolutionary movement is purely military in nature and has no connection to political parties. However, some unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to disrupt order until the police deployed armored vehicles to patrol the city, restoring order. Most shops remained closed on Saturday, and all city traffic was at a standstill. Military police were stationed at all important locations to maintain order. During the incident, the people were unaware of the truth. Only after General Luo Sun issued a proclamation reassuring the people did they begin to understand. The proclamation stated that Costaes' planned government could not guarantee order, and some government officials were responsible for this incident.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of the United States and Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency quotes qualified sources in Washington as saying that the United States will recognize the new Argentine regime if it fulfills certain conditions. Upon receiving news of the revolution in Argentina, Washington circles generally believed that the revolution was aimed at the Castillo government's strict adherence to neutrality. Therefore, they warmly welcomed the new government's joining the anti-Axis cause. They now declare that General Luo Sun must prove his ability to maintain law and order and to recognize and fulfill all of Argentina's international obligations. However, before the situation in Argentina stabilizes, Washington's attitude can be described as cautious.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Reuters' diplomatic correspondent claimed last night that while the British government is not in a position to make any criticisms at this stage of the Argentine coup, it can be asserted that the British government will recognize the new government of Ramirez in due course.</p>
<h3>Spain Proposes Establishing Safety Zones, Urges Belligerents to Consider Humanity</h3>
<p>Madrid, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In view of the heavy casualties suffered by non-combatants in various belligerent countries due to bombing during this war, the Spanish government made a proposal to all belligerent countries on the 5th, calling on all countries to pay attention to humanitarianism during bombing. In addition, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on this proposal, stating that the Spanish government's proposal to all belligerent countries is based on Spain's strict neutral stance and purely humanitarian considerations, without any suggestion from any belligerent country.</p>
<p>Madrid, 6th (Telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency: The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally proposed the establishment of safety zones, free from terror bombing, to emphasize humanitarianism. The Ministry submitted the following points to the press:</p>
<p>(1) Each belligerent country shall indicate the areas that include military targets. (2) Each belligerent country shall indicate areas that contain a portion of military targets, specifying the location of the military targets in detail. (3) Areas without military targets shall also be indicated, and these areas shall not be bombed. If military targets are established in these areas, the belligerent countries shall reach an understanding on this matter. (4) Appoint a standing committee of neutral countries, and each belligerent country may also send "advisors" to participate. The nature of this committee is similar to that of the "Prisoner of War Committee" during the First World War, and its task is to manage the implementation of these restrictions.</p>
<p>The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that this proposal is not intended to restrict the activities of the air force, but is entirely based on humanitarian considerations. Rumors that Spain is being exploited by foreign countries are completely untrue. The foreign ministries of all major powers can prove Spain's independence and its zeal for protecting its sovereignty.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt to Deliver Broadcast Speech Today</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech to the representatives attending the Hot Springs Conference tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister to Report to the House of Commons on the Washington Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a communiqué issued from London last night, Prime Minister Churchill will make a brief statement at the next meeting of the House of Commons. It is believed that Churchill will report on his recent consultations with Roosevelt and his visits to Algiers and Tunisia.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The British Cabinet held a plenary meeting yesterday, chaired by Churchill. The meeting was held a few hours after Churchill returned to London from North Africa. At the same time, well-informed sources in London yesterday denied that Churchill had participated in the negotiations between Giraud and de Gaulle in Algiers. It is said that Churchill, accompanied by British Chief of the General Staff General Brooke, only attended the ceremony after the establishment of the French Committee of National Liberation. Churchill only met Giraud and de Gaulle on Friday at a banquet hosted by British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Cunningham. It was revealed yesterday that Churchill was accompanied to North Africa by British Foreign Secretary Eden, General Brooke, and U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall. This group met several times with Generals Eisenhower, Alexander, Montgomery, and Anderson, as well as Air Chief Marshal Tedder and other military leaders. It is said here that these consultations are a continuation of the discussions in Washington.</p>
<h3>US Coal Mine Strike Resolved, 500,000 Workers Return to Work</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The United Mine Workers of America yesterday ordered 500,000 workers to return to work on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A dispatch from Washington: The strike dispute of coal miners in the eastern United States was resolved on the 4th thanks to the advice to resume work given to workers by Louis, who represented 10,000 unemployed people, and the decision of the Coal Mine Association to resume work. Thus, this is effectively a victory for the government. The coal mining industry has suffered enormous losses from the strike in the past five days. Reuters New York correspondent Immsion estimated that the losses amounted to tens of millions of tons. Among them, Carnegie Illinois Steel Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, suffered particularly significant losses. On the 5th, due to the lack of coking coal, eleven blast furnaces at the steel plant were extinguished. The company also announced that it is actively working to maintain other blast furnaces, which shows the extent of the losses.</p>
<h3>North China Special Report: The Future of North China – Prospects for Self-Strengthening – Talk by Commander Otani of the Japanese Army in North China</h3>
<p>Regarding the various situations in North China after Japan's shift in its policy toward China, the current state of the Japanese army in North China and the results of the spring campaign, China's participation in the war and Japan's policy toward China, as well as the future problems of North China and current issues, Commander Otani of the Japanese Army in North China spoke to reporters on the 4th: The Japanese army in North China, in accordance with national policy, has been shifting its policy toward China since the beginning of this year. As a result, the people of North China have been able to re-recognize the meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation and strive for self-strengthening. The construction of North China is also gradually getting on track. The main points can be divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Current Situation of the North China Army and the Results of the Spring Campaign</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese army in North China has transferred political and economic affairs handled by the military to the Chinese side for self-management. The Japanese army has basically stabilized the entire territory of North China on a large scale and is actively assisting the Chinese side in laying the foundation for self-strengthening. As a result, the North China Army only needs to bear the burden of combat affairs. In terms of attacking the Yu and Communist armies, significant results have been achieved. The tasks of the military have been simplified, so the combat power can naturally increase. Looking at the statistics of the battle results, the two items of prisoners and captured goods, up to the end of April last year, the number of Yu and Communist troops who surrendered was 739 times, with 31,647 soldiers. Up to April of this year, the number of surrenders was about 500 times, with about 100,000 soldiers. After investigation, the latter has fewer times but more soldiers, which proves that the Yu and Communist armies have realized this and can gather to return. At the same time, the Yu side's will to fight has declined, and the decline in combat power is becoming more and more obvious.</p>
<p>(2) The Mission of North China and Current Issues</p>
<p>North China occupies the position of a supply base in the Greater East Asia War and is also the central area for the construction of Greater East Asia. Its position and mission will become even more important in the future. At this moment, the duty entrusted to us is to make North China an ideal place for Sino-Japanese cooperation in material and spiritual terms. To create a true cooperative relationship, it is necessary to develop the economy in order to promote the Sino-Japanese joint war. However, there is still a Chinese Communist army in North China, which is an obstacle to the construction of North China. I am deeply afraid that ignorant people will be deceived by the Chinese Communists one day. The purpose of the Chinese Communists is to take advantage of the chaos to communize China in order to establish their dictatorial regime. At present, Chiang Kai-shek is adopting a policy of accommodation toward the Communists, but Chiang also knows the nature of the Communists and is only trying to use them temporarily. In order to build a healthy North China, the Japanese army is determined to thoroughly eliminate the Communist army. Therefore, it is urgent to recognize its conspiracy to win over the people through false propaganda and coercion, establish counter-communist countermeasures, and launch vigorous actions. In particular, the new politics of the Chinese side must be widely and deeply rooted in the people, because relying solely on military force is not enough to suppress the Communists. Looking at the Communist strategy of using popular support as a background, the new political forces of the Chinese side must closely follow the military force of the Japanese army and be widely and deeply rooted in the villages that have been communized. The Japanese army is particularly concerned about this and will not hesitate to provide full support.</p>
<p>(3) The Inevitable Victory of the Japanese Army in North China</p>
<p>Everything in North China, as mentioned above, has been painstakingly built over the past six years, and I am convinced that the path to success is not far away. Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese army in North China has followed national policy and changed its policies. At the same time, the people of North China have also re-recognized the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and the atmosphere of active self-strengthening has suddenly become intense. On the one hand, the overall combat power of the Japanese army in North China has been actively improved. With this strength, we can protect North China, cooperate in restoring public order, and promote sound construction. In short, the Japanese army in North China is full of confidence in victory and hopes that the people of North China will trust the fair attitude of the Japanese army in order to build North China and contribute to the healthy development of the new China and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

<h3>Beijing Correspondence: A Corner of the Academic World in the Old Capital: A Cultural Institution of a Neutral Country</h3>
<p>— Student</p>
<p>In these times when the smell of gunpowder permeates the world, neutral countries are rare indeed. To transform from a belligerent to a neutral country is even more unprecedented. In these withering times, the establishment of a cultural institution is rare enough. A cultural institution devoted solely to the study of Sinology is even more commendable. Therefore, under this double "rarity," it is not surprising that the founding of the "Sino-French Institute of Sinology" is intriguing.</p>
<p>The Sino-French Institute of Sinology is an academic institution founded by the French Embassy in China in the autumn of the year before last. The origins of the cultural communication between France, known as the center of modern Western culture, and Chinese culture go back a long way. In the late sixteenth century, French Jesuits conducted some sporadic research on China. However, the scientific study of China began in the early eighteenth century, with the contributions of Fathers Ma Ruose and Song Junrong being the greatest. Further efforts by Professors Remusa and Julien in the nineteenth century laid the foundation for modern French Sinology. France has long been recognized by the world academic community as the center for Sinological research. At this most delicate moment in the international situation, the French Embassy in China actually wanted to open a new path in academic culture and founded the Sino-French Institute of Sinology. Its contribution to the academic community cannot be denied.</p>
<p>The original location of the Institute was downstairs in the library of the Sino-French University and in several bungalows to the north (the building of the Sino-French University was lent to the Law School of Peking University, and there were few rooms left). Last autumn, the research room was moved a little further north, downstairs from the Xuexue Institute, leaving only the library and exhibition room in their original location. Now, after renovation and refurbishment, the appearance of the Institute has a certain dignity.</p>
<p>There are two people in charge of the Institute. The so-called Director, who is responsible for research guidance, is Mr. Dor Meng. The Chairman, who is actually responsible for administrative affairs, is Mr. Du Boqiu, the secretary of the embassy. Mr. Dor is an old China hand, having spent more time in China than in France. He came to China more than thirty years ago as a professor at Peking University, and later taught at Peking University and the Sino-French University. Now he is almost "white-haired and bearded like clouds," but he is still very energetic, always working until two or three o'clock. It was under such a diligent spirit that he succeeded in becoming a figure in the current French Sinological community, although he has no major works, he is the boss behind the famous Sinologist Granet. Mr. Du, on the other hand, is a relatively young diplomat. He is the son-in-law of a famous Chinese antique dealer. Perhaps influenced by his wife, he became interested in Chinese academics, especially Chinese ancient paintings. He has collected many Chinese ancient paintings and antiquities, and is considered an antique connoisseur. He was the main contributor to the establishment of the Sino-French Institute of Sinology. We can see him every day sitting in his most modern car traveling between Jiaomin Lane and Donghuangchenggen, a busy man in Beijing.</p>
<p>The Institute has four groups: Folklore Group, Language Group, History Group, and Index Compilation Group. Each group has its own special work and plans. The entire Institute has about twenty or thirty researchers, clerical staff, and secretaries. They go to the Institute all day to work, hoping to find treasures from the piles of broken ancient paintings.</p>
<p>The Institute publishes a journal called "French Studies." The articles published fall into two main categories: one is to introduce French, mostly translations of famous French works, and the other is to introduce Chinese, mostly translations of excellent Chinese works. It is a reference material specifically for foreigners to study Chinese or Chinese to study French.</p>
<p>The Institute has held two exhibitions. One was the Chinese New Year Paintings Exhibition in the summer of last year. It collected many New Year paintings from various places and made simple textual research on the characters and stories in the books, which were printed into a catalog. Later, a film company made it into a film. People in Shanghai may have seen Mr. Du Boqiu gesturing in the exhibition hall on the screen. One is the Exhibition of French Sinological Works of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, which is still being held. It has collected seventy-five kinds of rare and ancient paintings, as well as sixteen paintings of the complete map of the pacification of the Ili Hui Region and twelve paintings of the war to pacify Xinjiang painted for the Qing court by Western painters, all of which are rare materials. Among them, "A Continuation of the Current Situation in China" by Li Ming, published in 1701, "Notes on the Chinese Language" in Latin by Ma Ruose, published in 1831, "Outline of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government" translated into French by Feng Bingzheng, published between 1777 and 1785, and "French-Chinese-Mongolian Dictionary" copied in the eighteenth century are the rarest. The Institute has published a catalog of the exhibited works, with brief introductions to the author's life and the beginning and end of his study of Sinology. Overall, it can be considered a lively show for the lonely academic community in Beijing.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to help Chinese students learn French and French students learn Chinese, there are also French evening schools and special Chinese classes. This structure is enough to be called "Sino-French."</p>
<p>I remember when the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica was established, Mr. Fu Sinian said that the Chinese should strive to move the center of Sinological research from Paris to Beijing. Now the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has followed Mr. Fu Sinian and ran to the side of the Lijiang River, where "less than ten people have died two or three." In Beijing, apart from this Sino-French Institute of Sinology, there is no other organized institution dedicated to the study of Sinology. However, this is also incomplete, and besides, it was founded by the French, and the purpose is inevitably to focus on the cultivation of French Sinologists. So, when will Mr. Fu Sinian's wish have any hope of being realized? (June 2nd)</p>

<h3>Police Department Explains in Detail: If Police Officers Engage in Unruly Behavior, Citizens Can Report Directly to the Police Department. Baojia Personnel Should Assist from the Sidelines and Should Not Engage in Direct Confrontations.</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that maintaining public order at the Squid Fair is the practical responsibility of police officers, and that Self-Defense Corps members and the public should assist from the sidelines, the Public Concession Police Department is issuing this notice because citizens often have various misunderstandings when police officers are performing their duties. Therefore, it is specially sending a letter to the Baojia Committee for detailed explanation. Now the Baojia Committee has forwarded the letter to the Lienpao Chiefs, instructing the residents under their jurisdiction. Our Shanghai Social News reporter has transcribed the original letter as follows: "It has been noted that citizens often misunderstand the authority of police officers when they are performing their duties, which leads to misunderstandings and disputes, which is extremely regrettable. Now, in order to strengthen citizens' understanding and respect for police authority, the following explanations are provided:</p>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate Unruly Behavior: This Police Department is the parent official of the local citizens, and its duty is to maintain local public order. In addition to strictly abiding by the law, citizens should also fully assist at all times and in all places. In particular, Baojia personnel should also persuade citizens who are unclear so that they do not misunderstand and cause trouble. As for police officers performing their duties, if there is any unruly behavior, citizens can record their number, date, time, and facts in detail and report them directly to the Director of this Department in writing or orally, who will thoroughly investigate and handle them. We must strive to obtain close contact between the citizens and the Police Department and clarify bad habits.</p>
<p>Avoid Direct Confrontations: It is further explained that the establishment of the current Baojia system is purely for the purpose of citizen self-government. Baojia personnel should bear the obligation to assist the authorities and are definitely not comparable to police agencies. It is natural for their assistance measures to directly assist public officials in performing their duties, but when reporting public officials, they must not engage in direct confrontations with the police officer, otherwise, they may be suspected of obstructing official duties. This is a key to local public order, and it is necessary to consider the citizens' own position and understanding of local agencies. Only with a deep understanding can the foundation of social order be laid.</p>
<h3>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Police Department is on Strict Alert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Headquarters, in order to ensure public order in the city today on the lunar Dragon Boat Festival, has ordered the Detective Corps and its subordinate branches to strengthen their vigilance to ensure safety. In addition to the fact that each branch has been ordered to be on alert, the Detective Corps Commander has also instructed each sub-team to pay attention to and strictly search the ports and stations at all times. All iron gates in the French Concession have also been assigned personnel to guard and implement inspections.</p>
<h3>The Zhang Jinhai Murder Case Will Be Re-trialed This Morning</h3>
<p>Regarding the Zhang Jinhai murder case, the Second Special District Local Court of this city has opened a trial twice. This morning at 9:00 AM, the court will summon Li Xiuying's father, Li Yinsheng, and his neighbor, Huang Xiqing, as well as the relevant witnesses Kang Wanqing and Chen Hongli, to court for questioning. At the same time, the two murderers, Mirai and Buckley, will also be summoned to court for cross-examination.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Sugar in Nanshi Phase 3: Adulteration and Fraud Discovered, Hope the Responsible Authorities Will Stop It</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Bureau has entrusted the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to universally start selling the Phase 3 household sugar in Nanshi from yesterday. However, the trend of sugar adulteration among general sugar merchants has not been curbed. It has been found that Huang Jixiang and Yu Jiabin, the hosts of Hengxing Store at No. 22 Chuanjia Street, Huajin Road, Nanshi, grind the coarse granulated sugar allocated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office into fine sugar, add powder, and mix it with cold water, in order to covertly deduct sugar. This has caused complaints from nearby residents. Moreover, the purchased sugar often feels short in weight. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will effectively curb this, severely punish it, and deter others from following suit.</p>
<h3>Vigilance During Air Raid Alarms: Do Not Extinguish All Lights, But Ensure Light Does Not Escape</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) morning, the French Concession's Xuhui District Police Department summoned the district's Baojia (neighborhood security) chiefs for training. This was deemed necessary to correct and explain the lighting situation during the previous night's air raid drill in the district. A French police chief delivered instructions, which were translated by Inspector Zhong Youlin, roughly as follows: The performance of the 148th Lianbao (joint security unit) was the best during the air raid drill the previous night. The unit was completely dark, without a trace of light. However, during vigilance alarms, one should not extinguish electric lights. It is only necessary to properly cover the windows with curtains. Lamps should also be covered with black cloth lampshades to ensure that light does not shine outwards. Only during emergency alarms should electric lights be completely extinguished, otherwise the most severe penalties will be imposed. Extinguishing electric lights during vigilance alarms is a mistake. Furthermore, according to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Xuhui District will continue to hold air raid drills on the evening of the 7th (Monday). At that time, senior police officers from the department will personally inspect lighting and all air defense equipment at various locations.</p>
<h3>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival: Donate Festival Funds to Help Disaster Victims; Industrial and Commercial Sectors Save on Banquets; This Newspaper Will Collect and Forward Donations Again</h3>
<p>The plight of the disaster in Northern China is already well known to all sectors of Shanghai society. Since the launch of relief efforts, there has been enthusiastic support and generous donations. The collected funds have already reached a certain amount. However, the disaster area is vast, and there are many victims, requiring huge amounts of money. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. Leaders from all sectors of society, recognizing the urgency of the situation, are either saving on banquets to aid relief efforts or allocating business profits to relief funds, acting selflessly and justly, which is deeply admirable. Donations can be directly handed over to this newspaper for collection, so that they can be accumulated and forwarded to the receiving agencies for processing.</p>
<p>Basketball Charity Match Continued</p>
<p>The second relief basketball match, between Zhongbei and Junyu, continued last night at the China Youth Hall, with a larger audience than the previous night. Unfortunately, Junyu was exhausted from continuous fierce battles. Apart from leading twice in the first half, they were ultimately defeated by Zhongbei by a score of 34 to 30, winning a triumphant victory by two points. Last night's charity ball auction was purchased by Li Xiaobao for 30,000 yuan. Junyu donated a total of 1,080 yuan, the Shanghai side's food expenses for three days, entirely to the disaster relief fund. Tonight at 8 p.m., Junyu will play against Xilian, still at the China Youth Hall.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yuan Ludeng Sells Calligraphy to Aid Relief Efforts: Limited to Today Only</h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, recognizing the severity of the disaster situation in North China, has accepted the invitation of the Shanghai Painting Gallery on Zhejiang Road (at the intersection of Ningbo Road) to sell calligraphy to aid relief efforts. Fan surfaces are priced at 100 yuan per page, and four- or five-foot couplets and signboards are priced at 200 yuan each.

<h3>Su Yizhi Case: Wuxi Compatriots Express Support: Letter to the Court Requesting Justice</h3>
<p>Since the Su Yizhi case, where she died in anger after being humiliated, occurred in this city, all sectors of society have been indignant, and public opinion has been in an uproar, accusing Liu Wangshi of illegality, hoping that the judicial authorities will make a decision as soon as possible to satisfy the public. However, the Special First Court held a hearing on the 2nd, but postponed it to the morning of the 11th because the autopsy report had not yet been delivered. There is much suspicion and discussion about why the autopsy report has been delayed. Yesterday was Teachers' Day, and the Wuxi Association in Shanghai sent a special representative to comfort the Su Yizhi family and sent a letter to the Special First Court, requesting justice and vowing to provide support. A board of directors meeting will be held in the coming days to discuss how to proceed. The association hopes that all organizations in this city will uphold justice and support the Su case. The association's official letter to the Special First Court is recorded as follows: "Sir/Madam: It has come to our attention that Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at the private Sacred Heart Elementary School in this city, was repeatedly insulted by Liu Wangshi, the family member of student Liu Zhijun, for disciplining the student, and died in anger. Whether there was fatal injury etc. will have to be determined after a forensic examination, we will not discuss it for now. It is about applying corporal punishments, respecting the importance of teaching, Xia Chu's case can be seen in the scriptures. However, the family member Liu Wangshi became tyrannical by nature, and relying on being the wife of the secretary of the Lianbao office, ignorant of observing laws and regulations, dared to take advantage of her position, arbitrarily roar, punch and kick, which is very hateful, and will not be able to maintain the dignity of education if she is not severely punished. This association has the relationship of compatriot with Ms. Su Yizhi, and now seeing Ms. Su's tragic death, the situation is deeply sympathetic, and we should give sympathy and give her support. In addition to sending letters of support, we should send a letter to request that you investigate and severely punish Liu Wangshi, to quell public anger and redress the grievance, and we are grateful for that. Sincerely, the Shanghai Wuxi Association."</p>
<h3>Bandit Robs Vietnamese Police Officer of Gun, Arrested</h3>
<p>Vietnamese Police Officer No. 358 of the French Concession was on duty at the intersection of East Avenue Edward and Zilaihuo Street yesterday morning. Suddenly, two men in short clothes came from behind, intending to rob him of his gun. As one of them was wrestling with the officer, the other pulled out a sharp axe and struck his head, causing a wound about two inches deep, with blood flowing freely. However, the officer still blew his whistle frantically in pain, resulting in the arrest of one of the assailants. The other managed to escape. The arrested suspect confessed his name as Ni Xingyuan, 28 years old, from Pudong, and admitted his guilt without hesitation. The injured officer was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Remedying the Panic in Papermaking Raw Materials: First Batch of Pulp to Arrive in Shanghai This Month: Paper Prices Expected to Gradually Decrease</h3>
<p>The soaring paper prices have significantly impacted cultural undertakings. The pulp, which is the raw material for papermaking in this city, had its allocation suspended previously. Therefore, personnel were dispatched to request the Japanese side to continue the allocation. However, the news has been slow in coming, leading the papermaking industry in this city to repeatedly raise paper prices, citing a lack of raw materials.</p>
<p>First Batch of Pulp to Arrive in Shanghai This Month: It has recently been learned that the source of the aforementioned pulp raw materials has been secured. The first batch of 5,000 tons of pulp is expected to arrive in Shanghai this month from Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, and other places. Thereafter, if the situation remains unchanged, 3,000 to 5,000 tons of pulp will continue to be shipped to Shanghai in July, August, September, and October.</p>
<p>Pulp Prices Expected to Decrease:</p>
<p>There are currently a total of 17 Chinese-owned paper mills in this city. Since September of last year, they have not received any pulp allocation and have used old wastepaper as their main raw material for papermaking, leading to a significant increase in the price of wastepaper, and the production volume of paper mills has also decreased to 60%. After this batch of pulp arrives, due to its good quality and low price, the papermaking industry in this city can be revitalized. And paper prices are also expected to be reduced.</p>
<h3>Vagrant Labor Training Center Actively Hiring Workers for Construction; Salvation Army to Establish Bathhouse for Beggars</h3>
<p>The World Red Cross Society was designated by the authorities of the three municipal districts of this city to operate the Caohujing Vagrant Labor Training Center since the beginning of last month, and a month has passed. The training center is actively hiring workers for construction, and some parts have already been completed.</p>
<p>Ready to Start Handling Accommodation Matters: It is said that the authorities have purchased 90 acres of land in Caohujing and are preparing to build 400 rooms. The municipal authorities and the World Red Cross Society have allocated huge sums of money for operation, and it is expected that the Vagrant Labor Training Center can be fully completed within this year. In order to maintain summer hygiene and preserve street cleanliness, although the training center has not been fully completed, it has already begun to handle accommodation matters.</p>
<p>The Life of Street Beggars is on the Brink of Collapse:</p>
<p>It has been found that most street beggars do not have residence permits, so the authorities have reason to order them to be sent to Caohujing on this basis. It is said that the life of the general street beggar is currently struggling in the border between life and death due to the hardship of life, so most of them are willing to live in the training center if the authorities order them to.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Salvation Army's Beggar Camp:</p>
<p>The Salvation Army's Beggar Camp held a fundraising movement for one month this year. The original target was 200,000 yuan, but the result was only 60,000 yuan, short of 140,000 yuan, and the results were very low. At the same time, according to an employee of the camp, the camp plans to set up a bathhouse for beggars this summer, so that beggars can bathe with vouchers to maintain the personal and public hygiene of beggars.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Consumer Cooperative: Enthusiastic Participation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city, in view of the frequent soaring prices of all goods, which is related to people's livelihood and social security, have initiated the preparation for the establishment of the "Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative." It is planned to have 50,000 people as basic members, becoming a large-scale consumer cooperative organization, to centrally purchase major goods in large quantities and sell them to members at low prices. In order to establish the cooperative as soon as possible, a first preparatory meeting was held, and Sun Zhenquan was publicly elected as the director of the preparation, and the solicitation of members was approved. It is learned that participation in the cooperative as members from all sectors is very enthusiastic, but the period is not long, until the 15th of this month. Anyone who wishes to join can go directly to the cooperative's office at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to obtain application forms.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital: Epidemic Department Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital's epidemic department this year is scheduled to open on the 16th of this month and has hired seven main physicians and four special physicians to see patients. All expenses for the hospital's third-class ward are free. Patients can contact the hospital directly, and the procedures are simple.

<h3>The Nation and Teachers</h3>
<p>— Zhou Huarin</p>
<p>—Radio Broadcast Speech on the 32nd Teachers' Day in Shanghai—</p>
<p>Dear teachers, fellow citizens, today is Teachers' Day. Before I get to the topic, I want to mention two recent events that are very sad. One is the suicide of Mr. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, and the other is the murder of a classmate by a middle school student, Mei Lianjiang. The former is the result of a parent who has not received education casually insulting a teacher, causing the teacher to die in anger. The latter can be said to be caused by the failure of school education. Facing these two education cases, we are truly ashamed and heartbroken. And today is Teachers' Day, and I am asked to say a few words, so I can't help but feel deeply emotional. But these two events have their greatest causes and their social backgrounds. We don't have to blame anyone for being responsible. However, we ask the nation and society to bear a kind of responsibility for teachers, and teachers should also fulfill a kind of obligation to the nation and society. Now I would like to explain these two aspects.</p>
<p>First, the responsibility that the nation should bear for teachers: Teachers endure hunger and cold and work hard as youth, the purpose of which is certainly not to hope to get any reward from students, but to hold a lofty ideal, for the bright future of the nation and make the next generation of citizens get rid of the life of the dark ages. Therefore, they do not hesitate to sacrifice personal comfort, do not avoid spiritual and living pain, to nurture talents for the country and create good citizens for society. Teachers' aspirations are so pure and righteous, so the nation and society should show respect, fulfill the responsibility of supporting and guaranteeing them, not only expressing sympathy for their hardships, expressing admiration for their hard work, but must bear the specific responsibility of assistance. The so-called specific responsibility, the first is for the cultivation of teachers. If the country wants excellent citizens and useful talents, it must have good teachers. The creation of good teachers must have a good normal school system. Let us try to check the situation of today's normal schools. The equipment is indeed simple and crude, and the normal school students created are not necessarily engaged in teaching. Therefore, the teachers serving in schools, 70% to 80% are not normal school talents, and those who are just filling the ranks are in the majority. Looking at this situation, the lack of teachers today is really a regret in education. Therefore, working hard on the cultivation of teachers should be an important task at present. But cultivating teachers cannot be done immediately. Before the normal school system is perfect, the old teachers should be trained, that is, to create new teachers on the one hand and retrain the original teachers on the other, so as not to neglect either. The students of normal schools should be given strict training to cultivate sound normal school talents.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of appointment. After rigorous training, students of normal schools should be immediately assigned as school teachers. Their treatment should be equal to that of civil servants, because they are fulfilling the responsibility of educating citizens for the country, just as civil servants are serving the country. Therefore, teachers should also enjoy the same treatment as civil servants. Teachers who have been trained and qualified cannot be transferred or dismissed without reason to maintain their permanent position.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of security. Graduates of normal schools should have concrete security, such as regulations on annual salary increases? To guarantee their lives, they cannot be dismissed without fault to guarantee their positions, and insurance and savings systems should be adopted to guarantee the occurrence of their accidents. Other welfare matters for teachers must also be planned and implemented in detail. These are all matters that should be specially stipulated by the state.</p>
<p>The fourth is the issue of rewards. It is not only should be rewarding their efforts at work, not only should be rewarding their perseverance, not only rewarding their contribution to scientific education, but also rewarding their spirit of constantly seeking knowledge, rewarding the发挥 of their special skills, and the methods of reward are divided into several types: honorary rewards, promotion rewards, and special rewards. Those with excellent results should be given special cultivation and promotion by the state. The above four are just examples, but even these four are the minimum responsibility that the nation and society should fulfill for teachers.</p>
<p>Second, the obligations that teachers should fulfill to the country: Regarding this point, I think all teachers have already understood it, and are practicing it, so I don't need to say more, but I think that in today's era, in addition to fulfilling their responsibilities in school education, teachers should also pay attention to the issues of social education and the ideology of the times. Schools are certainly educational institutions, but society is also a place for education. Even if school education is done well, if the social environment is too bad, it is easy to make the education students receive at school disappear without a trace. Therefore, while we are committed to school education, we must pay attention to social education. That is, teachers should be loyal to their duties in schools and set an example and play a model role in society, so that the social atmosphere can be changed and a good social environment can be created. Then school education and social education can be integrated to achieve the highest efficiency of education. This is one of the obligations that teachers should fulfill. Secondly, regarding the issue of the ideology of the times, schools are for the country to educate the people, and teachers bear a great responsibility for whether the people's thoughts are correct or not. Therefore, teachers must thoroughly understand the ideology of the times. For example, the program of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building is the national education policy, and the idea of Pan-Asianism and building a new East Asian order are the guiding ideologies of the times. We must uphold the national education policy and instill the ideology of the times into the people so that they can unite with each other and work hard for the liberation of the East Asian nations. This is the second obligation that teachers should fulfill. Since teachers have received the cultivation of the country, the respect of society, and the entrustment of parents, it is only natural that they regard education as a lifelong task. However, because the position is precious and important, their knowledge must advance with the times. Otherwise, if their knowledge is outdated, they will not be able to achieve their mission. To supplement their own knowledge, they must constantly learn and constantly seek knowledge, on the one hand, seeking the increase of experience, and on the other hand, seeking the increase of new knowledge, using their life's energy to devote themselves to the joy of education. This is the third obligation that teachers should fulfill.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express a point of view. Teachers endure the pain of material deprivation and a poor life, and continue to develop their spirit of serving the country. This is something we extremely admire. There are no less than 13,000 teachers in large and small schools in Shanghai. The average living expenses of elementary school teachers per month are less than 300 yuan, and the average for middle school teachers is less than 500 yuan. This material life is really not as good as that of vendors and peddlers. However, they still hold the ambition of nurturing talents for the country and continue to serve, which is really admirable. However, we cannot think that this situation is desirable. We hope that the nation and society will provide teachers with a guarantee of life.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to tell you teachers that after Germany failed in the First World War, German teachers only ate two slices of black bread every day. And their spirit of teaching young people never slackened. Twenty years later, Germany is again engaged in educational work in difficult circumstances, and there will definitely be a price in the future. The price we get is the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation. When we are enduring hardship, we can only take this sentence as comfort and encouragement to everyone.</p>

<h3>Closing Gambling Houses and Curbing Excessive Interest Pawnshops</h3>
<p>— Wang Shi</p>
<p>The evils of gambling dens have been discussed extensively in this newspaper, but the authorities have yet to take concrete measures and actions to crack down on them, which is very disappointing to our citizens. Looking at the large and small gambling dens in the various districts of the southern city, no less than tens of thousands of people are indulging in them every day, and most of them are young people. Losing fortunes and ruining reputations are the inevitable consequences for gamblers, and many people are still stubbornly persisting. On the one hand, it is indeed due to the gamblers' weak will and lack of self-control, which is their own fault. On the other hand, it is also due to the extremely strong and huge temptation of gambling dens. The temptations used are all the strongest in psychology, such as providing gamblers with satisfaction of appetite, hobbies, and enjoyment. Think carefully, the harm these two so-called entertainment and "winning makes you want to win more, losing makes you want to win back" pleasure grounds cause to our compatriots is no less than that of gambling dens. Why is that? Consider the following reasons: (1) Good Location: Although Shanghai is said to have more than four million people, the two concessions account for the majority. The two fields are located in the center of the French Concession, with convenient transportation and a central location, so their attraction is naturally greater than that of gambling dens. (2) Involvement of Intellectuals: Generally speaking, the patrons of gambling dens are nothing more than pot-bellied merchants, idle wives and young mistresses, and some hooligans. These people are parasites of society and waste products of the country, and they should have been eliminated at this time and place. What is there to pity about such "people"? As for the people who enter and leave the Jai Alai stadium and the dog racing track, they are very different from the former. The author lives on Avenue Albert and often sees young students (especially university students) entering and leaving them. Not a small number. They use their desire for money and the gambler's gambling psychology to achieve the purpose of killing people without bloodshed and devouring a large amount of gamblers' essence and blood. According to statistics, fifty or sixty families are ruined by gambling every day, and several people lose their lives every day, and it has become a breeding ground for crimes in Shanghai. The extent of the harm can be seen from this. If we continue to tolerate it, a portion of Shanghai's citizens and a portion of promising young people will inevitably be devoured by it, and the future of public security is also quite worrying.</p>
<p>In the past, gambling dens in the four districts of Shanghai were everywhere. Since Director Pan took office, he acted swiftly and decisively, clearing them all out in a few days. We deeply admire Director Pan's bold and resolute methods and hope that the authorities in the southern city will also do the same, closing all the gambling dens in various places, without worrying about other issues. It is better to cut out the rotten flesh than to let the whole body suffer. This is what all the citizens of Shanghai deeply hope for, so that they can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Pawnshops next to gambling dens aid the wicked in their misdeeds, exploit people with high interest rates, and disregard humanity. The interest rates are so high and the pawn periods are so short that they are rare in ancient and modern times. Each pawnshop generally operates two types of business: pawning goods and pawning pawn tickets. The pawn period for goods is generally two months, with an interest rate of eight percent per month, plus additional "storage rent" and "storage box" fees of ten percent. For example, if a suit of clothes is pawned for one hundred yuan, the amount written on the pawn ticket is one hundred and ten yuan. When redeeming, an additional eight percent interest is added. If it is redeemed before one month, it will cost one hundred and eighteen yuan and eight jiao, plus a few jiao for "stamp duty." If it is not redeemed after two months, it will be confiscated. As for "pawning pawn tickets," the interest is so high that it is inhumane. For example, a pawn ticket with a face value of more than two hundred yuan can be pawned for about thirty or forty yuan, but the interest is as high as three jiao per yuan. If forty yuan is pawned, it will cost fifty-two yuan to redeem it. The term is one month, three weeks, or half a month. When pawning, the pawnshop issues a so-called "limited-price fixed-term consignment certificate," which states "Pawn ticket X, borrowed XX yuan from another place (i.e., the pawn amount), now borrowing XX yuan from this place (i.e., the pawn amount)." If forty yuan is pawned, the ticket will write fifty-two yuan, and fifty-two yuan must be paid to redeem the pawn ticket. The amount of interest is evident from this.</p>
<p>We deeply hope that the authorities in the southern city will make a great determination to fundamentally eliminate gambling dens and high-interest pawnshops, and absolutely prohibit the existence of gambling dens and small pawnshops and similar clothing storage facilities. The authorities have issued two orders to investigate and prohibit high-interest pawnshops, but the first order did not take effect. Those who were prohibited continued to be prohibited, and those who operated continued to operate. It is not known whether the second time will be effective. However, the main culprit is still the gambling dens. If all the gambling dens are closed, these high-interest pawnshops will disappear on their own. Otherwise, it is treating the symptoms but not the root cause. If the gambling dens are not eradicated, these pawnshops will be difficult to eliminate, or even more such things will be produced and intensified.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Call to Ban Gambling Dens, a Discussion on Jai Alai Stadiums and Dog Racing Tracks by Gan Zhong'an</h3>
<p>I remember two years ago, gambling dens in western Shanghai were everywhere, with hundreds of millions of yuan changing hands every day. The extent of the harm was truly indescribable. Fortunately, they were soon banned, and the people were still celebrating when the southern city followed western Shanghai, and the establishment of gambling dens there was like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, openly welcomed by a group of degenerates. It was not until recently that various groups and public opinion circles began to notice the intensity of its harm. Therefore, they have successively petitioned the authorities to ban them as soon as possible. I think in the near future, the authorities will definitely take appropriate measures, which is unnecessary for me to worry about. However, what is strange is that the disguised gambling dens that are comparable to gambling dens, such as the most "famous" Jai Alai stadium and the dog racing track, have never been publicly proposed. Requesting the authorities to ban them.</p>
<p>Some people enter the field out of curiosity, with the attitude of visiting, but are attracted by the magic. One is the pampered playboys who take the ill-gotten wealth of their fathers and brothers and squander it at will. These two types of people are in their prime, and they should be accumulating energy and talent to prepare for the country's use, but they do not know this and are willing to degenerate themselves, which is truly regrettable. From the above two points of view, we already feel that there is a need to ban them. Moreover, I am stupid and do not know if there are more serious harms that I have overlooked. Furthermore, at this time of national crisis, it is incompatible to have such strange phenomena on our country's territory.</p>
<p>Some say: The two fields are located in the French Concession, and other authorities cannot overstep their authority. This is true, but we can try our best to negotiate with the concession authorities.</p>
<p>The reason why the French Concession authorities allow the establishment of these two entertainment venues is nothing more than to increase the income of the concession. However, we believe that this is illegitimate income. Is it right to harm the public for the sake of the concession's income? Therefore, I hope that the French Concession authorities will quickly ban them for the sake of the people of Shanghai. As for the use of the two fields after the ban, it should naturally be based on the interests of the people. The dog racing track occupies a large area. In addition to continuing to be used for dog racing, a part of it should be used to plant flowers and plants for public officials and students to relax during their spare time. The Jai Alai stadium can be used as a venue for public gatherings or a public canteen, which can be modeled after the Youth Association Canteen on North Sichuan Road to benefit the people) are all suitable. In this way, the French Concession's economic income will naturally decrease; but it can gain the praise of the people of Shanghai, and this kind of spiritual gain is naturally better than monetary income. What do you think, French Concession authorities? (In response to the Huabei disaster relief)</p>
<h3>The Eleventh Batch of Coal Distribution, Payment and Delivery to Begin Within Days, Coal Distribution Still Divided into Four Grades, 2,500 Tons Limited to Civilian Use</h3>
<p>The eleventh batch of coal distribution will be distributed by the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association in the coming days. A total of 2,500 tons of coal will be distributed, including 960 tons of Liuquan lumps, 1,389 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 151 tons of Jiaozuo powder. The association will soon send letters to its members, setting a deadline for payment and delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Four Grades of Distribution for Members</p>
<p>This distribution of coal is still divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A will receive 3 tons of Liuquan lumps, 4.25 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.5 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade B will receive 2.375 tons of Liuquan lumps, 3.375 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.375 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade C will receive 1.75 tons of Liuquan lumps, 2.625 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.25 tons of Jiaozuo powder. Grade D will receive 1.25 tons of Liuquan lumps, 1.75 tons of Jiaozuo lumps, and 0.2 tons of Jiaozuo powder.</p>
<p>Designated Collection Agencies</p>
<p>The Coal Retailers Association has designated more than twenty coal companies, such as Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai, to collect payments in order to centralize the collection of coal payments. All members of the association, regardless of their grade, must pay the payment to the designated collection agency upon receiving the association's notice and bring their receipt to collect goods. Failure to do so will result in suspension of distribution and cancellation of membership.</p>
<p>Limited to Civilian Use</p>
<p>This coal is limited to civilian use, such as boiled water shops, restaurants, bathhouses, and apartments. It must not be sold to factories for fuel, as the factories' monthly fuel needs are already fully allocated by the authorities, and there is no shortage. If any member is found to have sold it to factories or raised prices in an attempt to resell it for profit, or refused to sell it to civilian users, they will be dealt with according to the regulations upon discovery.</p>

<h3>Serious Famine in Chaoshan, Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association Appeals for Relief, Coarse Rice Costs More Than 500 Stored Vouchers Per Dou, More Than 100 People Starve to Death Every Day in Chaoyang and Chaoan</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas of Guangdong, the drought has already formed. Food prices have soared, and it costs more than 500 stored vouchers to buy one dou of rice, which is still not available. People are dying on the roads, and the scene is unprecedentedly tragic. The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai is appealing for help for the disaster victims and has telegraphed the authorities, requesting that they quickly arrange for emergency relief. The text of the telegram is as follows: "Urgent Nanjing to Chairman Wang of the National Government and Minister Ding Jun of the Ministry of Social Welfare: It is found that the Chaoshan area of Guangdong is a rice-deficient area, which has always been supplemented by foreign rice. Since the outbreak of the war and the imposition of the maritime embargo, there has been a rice shortage. This year's prolonged drought has caused a disaster. Food prices have soared, and it is impossible to buy one dou of coarse rice or one dan of sweet potatoes with 500 stored vouchers. More than 100 people die every day in Chaoyang, Chaoan, and other counties. The fellow villagers in Shanghai are deeply saddened every time they receive news from their hometowns. We hereby telegraph your seat, begging you to order the governors to arrange for relief and protect the remnants. The telegram is full of tears. Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association respectfully begs, Wei, Yin." "To Governor Chen of Guangdong Province: Chaoshan has suffered from the ravages of war and now suffers from a severe drought. The rice shortage is becoming increasingly serious. More than 100 people are starving to death every day in Chaoyang, Chaoan, and other counties. The scene is unprecedentedly tragic. Please arrange for urgent relief, dredge the grain transportation, and exempt taxes, so as to protect the remnants. The telegram is full of tears.

<h3>Poet and Beggar</h3>
<p>— Shi Jieyuan</p>
<p>The poet, Lin Yi, was preparing to create his masterpiece! He pondered, pacing back and forth in the room, and then said to his younger brother sitting at the table, "Move the side dish bowl away! Leave this spot for me." Following this, he placed paper and pen down, as it was time for inspiration to descend.</p>
<p>Sitting nearby were four or five relatives, waiting for his father for something; they were chattering away, talking boisterously. In this environment, it was not suitable for creation. Helplessly, there was only one room in the house, and only this one table in the room.</p>
<p>"Writing poetry? Or a novel!" The poet, head in hand, was still considering this question; according to his habit—if one were to use a technical term, one should say his creative attitude—he always felt the need to write something before starting to think about the subject matter and deciding on the form of creation. The so-called need here included manuscript fees and fame. Lin Yi was a poet, and logically, creating beautiful poems was beyond doubt. However, today he was perplexed by this question: "Should I try writing a novel? Poems can't be long, and the manuscript fees are too meager!" For the sake of manuscript fees, he made up his mind. "However, novelists are not as respected as poets; the term 'novelist' is not as elegant as 'poet.' I've only published two poems..." When another kind of desire surged, he fell into a contradictory state of mind. A few days ago, he had published two short stories in a newspaper supplement, and his classmates had started calling him a poet, which he himself felt quite proud of. Now, having only published two poems, to switch to writing novels would inevitably be inconsistent with the elegant title of poet. Moreover, he was planning to publish a collection of poems, so it seemed he had to create a few more.</p>
<p>He pondered this question deeply for three-quarters of an hour, constantly circling in the quagmire of hesitation, unable to pull his feet out of the mud. Anxiously scratching his scalp, he felt a burst of heat all over his body as if pricked by many needles, and beads of yellow sweat seeped out of his forehead, his eyes still staring blankly at the white paper.</p>
<p>The womenfolk nearby were in high spirits, arguing and debating, their loud voices piercing the ears, as if deliberately trying to make trouble for our poet:</p>
<p>"I say it's not worth it no matter what!"</p>
<p>"It's naturally not worth it to spend money to buy bran, but this year is different from previous years. The bran grains picked out from the rationed rice are enough to feed two chickens."</p>
<p>"Making use of waste, without spending a single penny!"</p>
<p>"Second Sister-in-law is right. The next time Shun Chang goes, I have to ask him to bring back two chickens, one pound each. The money..."</p>
<p>"Money! Little Aunt, take your time to calculate it! The chickens there are indeed very cheap. Bringing chickens on the road, Ah Yi's father said, is also convenient, as the inspection is not strict!"</p>
<p>"That's good too. Anyway, we'll have to settle the accounts next time. The money that was short last time when we went 'naked' hasn't been settled with me yet!"</p>
<p>The poet's thoughts were like a tangled ball of thread, impossible to find the beginning; the guests were also lacking in manners, unafraid of disturbing him, turning his thoughts into a chaotic mess, seizing his mind.</p>
<p>"Stop talking! Stop talking!" Suddenly clutching his head, as if to grasp that lightning-like thought, he abruptly shouted out, impatiently turning his body.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Feeling unwell?" His mother put down the two rice bowls she was washing and asked.</p>
<p>"It is indeed particularly stuffy and hot today, a bit like the plum rain season," Little Aunt touched her temple, "Look, his head is covered in sweat."</p>
<p>"Headache!" Mother pressed his neck, "Ah Yi, go to sleep for a while!"</p>
<p>"It's not a headache, no need to sleep!" The poet looked at them awkwardly, unable to explain. He tapped his fingers and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Not a headache, then why are you holding your head?"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking..."</p>
<p>"Stop working so hard," Mother forced him to go to sleep, "Reading more books doesn't make a difference. Making money and getting rich has nothing to do with reading!"</p>
<p>He stared blankly at Mother, being forcibly pulled onto the bed. "I'm really not sick! I'm thinking..."</p>
<p>"Still being stubborn!" Mother glared at him and went back to washing the dishes. "Don't cry when a small hole becomes a big one and you can't fix it; if you get sick, you won't be able to afford medicine!"</p>
<p>"Great! Like spitting out a mouthful of saliva, he started to devote himself to his thoughts, and now he has decided to write a novel. It is a tragic love story about a delicate tulip-like girl in love with a college student; "Change the names of the main characters, and revise the story a bit, and it will immediately be another novel. Good! Vow to finish it today!"</p>
<p>He excitedly stood up, sat down at the table, and requested his mother: "Mom, my head doesn't hurt anymore..."</p>
<p>"Whatever you want, what can I do if you don't listen?" Mother smiled and whispered with Little Aunt.</p>
<p>Holding the fountain pen that couldn't absorb ink, he wrote the beginning of the novel on the draft:</p>
<p>"The moon," was like a hole in the dark blue sky, leaking mysterious silver light. The wind, sighed like the sigh of the Holy Christ, whispering to itself the sorrows of a sorrowful person. The stars, flashing loving eyes, scattering down..."</p>
<p>Writing, writing...the fountain pen froze there; how should the light of the stars be described? Mysterious! Already used that word. Loving—they are their eyes. Brilliant—too bland. Besides this, his brain was like a blank sheet of paper. There were no other words. So, he hesitated for a moment, picked up today's newspaper, and read the supplement, wanting to find a beautiful word there.</p>
<p>"We Need Popular Literature" This surprisingly alarming title appeared before his eyes. Need popular literature? Since it is needed, then sending such a work will surely be accepted. Thinking this, he concentrated on reading the essay. It generally discussed the bad trends in Shanghai's literary and art circles, which were entirely oriented towards superficial tastes; finally, it concluded with an impassioned concluding remark: "In this world where everyone is caught in the vortex of the times, and the new forces are breaking free from the shackles of the century, when light and darkness are pouring all their efforts into the struggle, do we still need sickly literature of wind, flowers, snow, and moon? Works that are alienated from the masses cannot be talked about in terms of combativeness and constructiveness. We need truly popular works that reflect the suffering and demands of the masses and overthrow the sickly literature of wind, flowers, snow, and moon."</p>
<p>"Yes!" The poet's emotions were stirred! "We need popular works!" Grasping the pen, he drew two large lines on the draft, indicating the overthrow of this sickly literature.</p>
<p>"However, what to write?" This time, he was perplexed again; without writing love novels about brothers and sisters, pastors, skilled stenographers, and artists, he couldn't imagine any other characters or stories. Where were the suffering and demands of the masses? He couldn't figure it out. "It seems I should go out into the streets, experience the suffering and demands of the masses, and then write!" He decided this: to experience the suffering and demands of the masses in half an hour, and with the materials, complete it in three hours.</p>
<p>"Ah Yi! Come back early! At six o'clock, you still have to go to Wharf No. 13 to get things for your father, which can save a few dollars in fare..." As he left, his mother wrote out a long list behind him, closed the door, and the sentences behind were vague.</p>
<p>The poet strolled on the road. At the cigarette shop across the street, people were scrambling to buy cigarettes, as it was the time for flat-price distribution.</p>
<p>"Two packs of Quanlu brand, hurry up!"</p>
<p>"One pack of Chicago, don't be so slow, people have been squeezing for a long time!"</p>
<p>"Five yuan and forty cents, three yuan and thirty-seven cents, no big bills!"</p>
<p>A woman with short hair held up two packs of Quanlu brand, squeezing outwards, a large hand tightly pressing her full chest.</p>
<p>"Damn you!" Laughing and scolding, swaying her duck-butt-like short hair flirtatiously.</p>
<p>"Hee...ha."</p>
<p>The poet craned his neck: "What are they doing buying cigarettes? Doing business themselves!"</p>
<p>"Tsk! Pig head!" The woman glared at him, contemptuously twisting her fat buttocks away, the poet stared in astonishment, following her back with his gaze.</p>
<p>"What good intentions are you thinking of? Idiot!" A worker-like man squeezed up. "If you're not buying cigarettes, please get out of the way!"</p>
<p>The poet staggered back two steps, colliding with the first person head-on.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he turned around, and it was a rice carrier selling rice. "Carrying this heavy rice, it must be very tiring?" He said with a smiling face, to experience the suffering.</p>
<p>"What kind of?" (Note: When buying and selling rice, the price is often quoted in the opposite way, for example, sixty-five yuan is quoted as five yuan.) "Five yuan, do you bring a scale?" That person looked at the person opposite, misunderstanding the words: a tall figure, a faded reddish-purple blue cloth jacket on his shoulders, a pile of messy hair on his head, a pair of old-fashioned glasses on his pale face, dim eyes staring at him from behind, thick lower lip. Hanging a humble smile—</p>
<p>"What is the market price in Caohejing today? How many yuan can you earn for each trip?" The poet planned to have a longer conversation with that person, leisurely putting his hands on his waist, asking with a very sympathetic tone, followed by a long sigh: "Hey! ...You guys work hard, carrying two dou of rice, running this long road, it is indeed a difficult thing. But, those big shots and gentlemen who are fed by the rice you carry? They don't sympathize with you at all! Humanity is a cruel and selfish animal! Hey! ..."</p>
<p>"Caohejing is three yuan today, carrying this long road, only earning two yuan per dou," with boundless resentment, half squeezed out by the shackles of life, half to prevent the other party from bargaining: "...You can take out your scale now! It doesn't matter if the police see it...Five yuan is the lowest price I can 'give'."</p>
<p>"Huh?..." The poet was stunned, being taken for a rice seller was a bit insulting to him, desecrating the poet's elegance; "Me? I'm not a rice seller! I'm a writer! Now I'm here specifically to experience your suffering! To reflect your demands!..."</p>
<p>"Damn it! If you're not buying rice, stop talking nonsense," that person was greatly disappointed and angry. Summoning his strength, he carried the rice bag and cursed viciously: "Making fun of people? Go away!"</p>
<p>The poet's courage was already half-hearted; he felt sour and uncomfortable in his heart! But for the sake of collecting materials, he strengthened his courage and continued his work of comforting and experiencing.</p>
<p>The masses didn't seem to feel the existence of such a poet; they didn't intend to get close to him, and they didn't need him to comfort their suffering or reflect their demands. Sometimes, they even had a strong aversion, almost suffering their bullying.</p>
<p>Once, turning into a quiet road, he saw two trishaw drivers struggling to drag heavy firewood, wanting to climb a gravel road in a garden.</p>
<p>"Go help them push it up!" Encouraging himself, he righteously pushed hard from behind. On the side, a trishaw driver, tightening his muscles and trying his best to support the heavy load, felt extremely tired, let go of his hands, and wiped his sweaty, tan face. Suddenly, he noticed someone humming heavily behind him.</p>
<p>"Stealing firewood, you bastard!" Scolding in a harsh Jiangbei accent, he rushed over.</p>
<p>Before he could explain, that person had already swung his thick hand to strike, and he could only flee like a homeless dog.</p>
<p>It seemed that there was an insurmountable wall standing between him and the masses, not knowing who had built it and when it had been built.</p>
<p>Wandering around the streets for a long time, still gaining nothing, he dejectedly returned home.</p>
<p>"Ungrateful, stupid people!" Thinking wildly, cursing the people, soon, home was in sight. A beggar, wrapped in rags, exposing a butt full of sores and scabies, with pus and blood blurred, stretched his head into the half-closed back door, muttering, begging.</p>
<p>"Get out of here! I won't give you a penny!" To vent his grievances, he sternly scolded. The beggar, caught off guard by someone driving him away, looked around in a panic for a while, wrinkled his face in a mournful expression, and dragged his tattered shoes away.</p>
<p>"Huh! ..." Staring fiercely at the back of that living ghost, something immediately reminded him, and he quickly changed his tone of voice, "Come! Come! Don't run away!"</p>
<p>The beggar turned his head in a daze, sizing up the other person's face, and stretched out his reed-like hand, "Sir, have pity, have pity on me!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so 'Sir! Have pity, have pity!' I'm asking you about very important, meaningful things!" He imitated the beggar's tone in a strange voice, and directly talked about the topic: "How did you fall into begging?"</p>
<p>"..." That person was stunned for a moment. "Sir! Have pity on our suffering. Since the war, there has been no business! I haven't had a bite of rice for two days. Sir, give me the money for a pancake!"</p>
<p>"Always wanting money!" The poet was not satisfied. Such plain material could not be written into a novel. "Say it in more detail, about the situation after losing your job, for example: where do you sleep at night..."</p>
<p>"Sir, what else do we beggars do if we don't ask for money?" The beggar's voice was even more miserable, "At night? Of course, on the street! Sir, give me five dimes!"</p>
<p>"Give you five dimes? Five dimes can't support you for a lifetime!" Patting his chest: "I'm not happy doing this kind of incomplete relief work. I want to do something more meaningful, to help you, to reflect your suffering with my vivid pen..."</p>
<p>"..." The reed-like hand slowly drooped down. ...</p>
<p>At this time, their conversation was interrupted; the back door opened:—it was the poet's mother.</p>
<p>"Looking for this, looking for that, not even a shadow! Where did you die?"</p>
<p>The poet raised his head high, silently, thinking it was not worth arguing, even if he did, he couldn't explain it clearly.</p>
<p>"Quickly pick up the cloth bag and go to Wharf No. 13!" Mother pulled him in, "It's already past five o'clock, wait a while, and your father will get angry again!"</p>
<p>"Bang!" The door was closed! The beggar's whole body trembled, fiercely glaring at the gray-black back door.</p>
<p>"The child doesn't learn well!" Mother was still nagging endlessly, her nagging was always flowing like a river, never ending: "Water flows downwards, people look upwards; you forget about doing proper things, and you even chat with beggars!"</p>
<p>The poet ignored her, alone thinking: "The novel can't be written! I should still write poetry!" In his mind, he first decided on the title: "Midnight Sigh—The Beggar's Song." So he chanted: (Inwardly boasting: "In a few days, after this poem is published in the ×× supplement, I will become a 'Popular Poet'")</p>
<p>"Sleeping on the cold cement floor, in the dark black curtain of the night,..."</p>
<p>This was a week after the poet completed the poem, according to his expectation, it should be the third day after his masterpiece was published.</p>
<p>His father had already returned from Pinghu for the second time. The day before yesterday, when he went to the wharf to pick up his father, his father stood there blankly, with only a stack of five pounds of New Year cakes beside him. When he saw his son coming, tears fell silently, and they looked at each other in silence, losing their souls, not knowing what to do. Finally, he still weakly picked up the New Year cakes and went home dejectedly.</p>
<p>"Another 'naked shoulder'!" The things that relatives entrusted him to bring were all confiscated. Losing more than five hundred yuan, he said some sharp words and left. He said it was for the sake of relatives, and he would postpone the repayment for now; however, he couldn't add more, and he wouldn't entrust him to bring things again from now on. His father relied on the money from these entrusted goods to buy some goods such as cigarettes and soap in Shanghai and sell them there. Then he would buy some New Year cakes, rice, meat, etc., to bring back to Shanghai. This time, he didn't have the capital and couldn't go anymore. He slept at home for a day, just sighing and groaning! After a series of sighs, he took his mother as a punching bag.</p>
<p>This morning, he went early in the morning, and only came back listlessly at half past two in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Buy six steamed buns, hurry up!" Panting, he gave his son three yuan; then, he whispered to his mother.</p>
<p>Our poet was unpacking a letter, which was a manuscript that had just been returned. His heart was beating rapidly, and the hand holding the envelope was trembling slightly. At first, he didn't believe this was his own rejection letter, perhaps it was sent to the wrong person? He thought. However, that conjecture immediately vanished. On the green manuscript, it was clearly the poem he had written after racking his brains. So, he started to look: perhaps there was something like, "Your masterpiece has already been read, admired very much, but unfortunately the environment..." But there wasn't, and the effort of searching was in vain.</p>
<p>"The editor is messing with me, blind and not recognizing Mount Tai!"</p>
<p>When his father called him to buy steamed buns, he finally raised his head from his chaotic thoughts and hastily took the money.</p>
<p>After buying the steamed buns and returning, he happened to meet that beggar's dirty head looking around again.</p>
<p>"Come over..." The poet discovered a treasure and called the beggar over. But this time it wasn't to experience his suffering and demands, but to call him to listen to the poet's masterpiece and experience the emotions within: "Come listen to what makes me shed tears! This is the crystallization of my hard work, which is also the suffering, demands, grievances, and anger that you have in your hearts but cannot express. But, damn it! The editor..."</p>
<p>So, his left hand tightly pinched the paper containing the steamed buns, and his right hand took out his poem and recited it:—that person looked at him strangely, not knowing what ghost he was stirring up? Then he fixed his eyes on the steamed buns in his hand with a craving look.</p>
<p>"Sleeping on the cold cement floor, in the dark black curtain of the night, is my wide and boundless embroidered quilt, the hard stone steps, barely serve as pillows..."</p>
<p>"What? I have an embroidered quilt?"</p>
<p>"Stop talking! The wonderful part is in the back." The poet waved his hand and continued: "The stars smile at me and scatter loving light..."</p>
<p>"I've never seen the stars smile, go away!" Suddenly, in a flash, the steamed buns in the poet's hand fell into the beggar's hands.</p>
<p>"Hey! ..." The poet shouted loudly: "Don't run, the wonderful part is coming!" But the beggar didn't have the leisure to listen to his recitation. He tore apart the paper that was stuck to the bottom of the steamed buns, stuffing three of them into his mouth in one day, and ran to the opposite side."</p>
<p>The poet stood there blankly for a while, hanging his head and returning home.</p>
<p>"Where are the steamed buns? It's been so long, haven't you bought them yet?" Father said angrily.</p>
<p>"They were snatched by a beggar!"</p>
<p>"What? Snatched by a beggar? Useless thing!" Father scolded him in a series, talking about his own hardships, being discriminated against and bullied, and now his eldest son was not aspiring, weak, and incompetent! ...Finally, he said: "It seems that the more deeply you study, the more useless you are. Tomorrow I will definitely call you to go to Pinghu with me to learn the ropes of doing business..."</p>
<p>"But, at school...there will be a monthly exam!... "</p>
<p>"Monthly exam? Don't read at all, you still have a year and a half until you graduate, I don't have that much money!"</p>
<p>The poet could not restrain himself and shed tears.</p>
<p>"What are you crying about?" Mother said: "Father has bad luck, going back and forth three times, and he has been 'naked' twice...If two people go, they can take things separately..."</p>
<p>The poet stood there silently, and thought about writing again: "What to write? Reflecting, no, it should be angrily shouting out, whose suffering and demands?"</p>
<h3>Aspirations</h3>
<p>— Zi Wu</p>
<p>School was dismissed from the F Town Central Elementary School at four o'clock, and it was still drizzling. After several days of spring rain, the playground was muddy, and the old sky presented a lead-gray face, looking down at the earth. A large group of elementary school students, like small sparrows in the snow, clamored and returned home in a disorderly manner from the school. In an instant, the school returned to silence.</p>
<p>Teacher Liu dragged his tired steps, having finished the sixth class, and carried a large stack of "Composition" notebooks from the sixth-grade classroom to the office.</p>
<p>There was no one in the office. Books and notebooks were piled messily on each desk. Faint light filtered in through the glass window, and the air was so gloomy.</p>
<p>Teacher Liu sat down at his seat and listlessly pushed the notebooks onto the desk. He saw that his desk was already piled with many unnecessary notebooks. Driven by a sense of responsibility, he reluctantly picked up his pen.</p>
<p>"Now, logically, I should rest a little," he said to himself.</p>
<p>However, he did not rest. Indeed, he should rest. He had already taught five classes today. Most of the old-fashioned desks and chairs exhausted him like a patient.</p>
<p>"I don't know why I must be a teacher?" he doubted, looking at the notebooks. "For a living, it's pitiful to say, not even enough to feed myself. Yet, with such intense work, I can't do it well..."</p>
<p>He looked at the campus outside the window. Everything in the campus seemed as dim as his heart. So he picked up the composition notebooks to grade. The topic for this composition was My Aspirations.</p>
<p>In every notebook he read, many innocent and naive ambitions were revealed. The children narrated their aspirations like dreams. He couldn't help but feel a little excited and silently prayed, "Children, may you realize all of these in the world in the near future!"</p>
<p>Soon, he discovered a particularly outstanding piece. It read:</p>
<p>"My aspiration is to eliminate all the ugliness in the world, eliminate human suffering, and become a great savior. I want to open a school so that all poor older children can have books to read, and then open a large factory so that everyone has work to do. As for myself? I will be a shipowner! To live a great seafaring life!"</p>
<p>Besides admiring the student's rich imagination, he couldn't help but sigh with emotion. His heart felt a pang of melancholy. Twenty years ago, didn't he have such aspirations? During his student days, he might have had even greater ambitions. But after twenty years of grinding, now, even making a living is difficult. These ambitions had long disappeared, he didn't know when. Now, he was just groping in chalk dust all day long for the sake of survival. Now, his own destiny and surroundings seemed to be filled with chalk dust-like confusion.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he stared blankly at the notebooks, seemingly feeling ashamed, uneasy, and remorseful...</p>
<p>"People should have aspirations!" he thought affirmatively. The cute, energetic little faces of that group of students floated into his mind from the notebooks. He seemed to gain courage again. "As long as one doesn't die, aspirations should not die out."</p>
<p>A trace of comforting smile appeared on his lifeless face. "Yes, although my life is so hard now, my work is great. Even if I never realize my own aspirations in my lifetime, realizing them indirectly through the children is equally valuable and worth celebrating."</p>
<p>So he continued to grade, correcting some awkward phrases. In the last one, it was written:</p>
<p>"My aspiration is to farm, and also help Mom wash clothes and cook... Because my family is very poor, my father died a long time ago, and Mom works very hard."</p>
<p>The short and sincere narration couldn't help but bring a rush of hot tears to his eyes. Infinite sympathy and pity welled up from the depths of his heart. He looked at the crooked name "Lu Jinsheng" on the opposite page, and he recalled that thin child in the classroom during the day, with a malnourished face, silent, and prone to crying...</p>
<p>"Environment, a terrible environment!" he sighed deeply. "That is a child who understands life, life has educated him. In the eyes of ordinary people, that seems to be an unpromising child. He doesn't want to be a hero or a great man. He permanently inherits his father's profession, using his hands to labor for a lifetime..."</p>
<p>He didn't know when it had started to rain harder. The outline of things in the room could not be seen clearly. Teacher Liu's hot tears had soaked through his clothes. When he finished grading the last notebook, his whole body was so weak that he could no longer support himself. The surroundings were as silent as a cemetery, with only occasional sobs.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, laboriously moved his body from the stool, and walked into the dark bedroom. A gust of cold air hit him. He helplessly pulled the tattered quilt over himself, closed his eyes, and lay quietly on the bed, waiting for dawn.</p>

<p>Economic Circle　Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Promoting the "Spirit of Mutual Help"</h3>
<p>The preciousness of human life lies in "mutual help." The heavens have unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have misfortunes that may occur at any time. Those who can help others will always be helped by others.</p>
<p>Helping others today is the foundation for others to help us in the future. The glorious and splendid history of humankind is entirely unfolded through struggle and mutual help.</p>
<p>Under the condition of "mutual help," there is also the meaning of "mutual benefit." We should maintain and promote this good nature of humanity. Economics is most closely related to human life, so economic assistance is also more urgently needed than any other assistance because it can dominate everything and benefit people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Based on this point of view, we feel that there are several things in the current economic sphere that are worth reflecting on and implementing:</p>
<p>(1) The North China disaster relief issue is truly extremely serious. Although various parties have promoted it, and considerable results have been achieved, it is still necessary to continue to work hard. The economic sector is in a better position and it is easier to raise funds. Is it possible that they have not fulfilled their greatest responsibility? This is worth reflecting on. We have repeatedly appealed for this, hoping to actively advocate and implement it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Thoroughly investigate hoarding. The government has taken vigorous action, and its purpose is nothing more than to seek stability in people's livelihood. Now that the deadline for releasing hoarded goods has passed, a comprehensive survey of materials will be conducted. For the sake of their own interests, our people should urgently assist, voluntarily report, so that prices tend to be normal and stable.</p>
<p>(3) The livelihood of employees should be improved as much as possible. Recently, among the many articles we have received about public life, most express dissatisfaction with current treatment and issue indignant calls. In this time of war, it is indeed true that it is not easy to develop business, but we always hope that employers will increase salaries as much as possible within the scope possible, so as to maintain a minimum standard of living. At the same time, employees should also understand the difficulties of employers and work together diligently. This is the fortune of both labor and capital.</p>
<p>The above three matters are just some examples based on recent observations. We deeply feel the preciousness of the "spirit of mutual help." How to promote and magnify it is the responsibility of every citizen, and it can also be said to be the responsibility of all humankind.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Shanghai Market: A General Overview of Finance, Industry, and Commerce</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week remained stable and flat. Financial changes were minimal. Although funds were tight due to the Dragon Boat Festival, the authorities properly adjusted them, and there was no impact on the overall market conditions. The interbank lending rate was listed at 20 cents. Military currency and joint banknotes did not fluctuate much. The limited price has been established. The publicly determined prices of industrial and commercial goods are six yuan per liter for household rice. The prices of oil and sugar have not moved. The price of yarn and cloth is average. The price of coal briquettes for civilian fuel is 32.5 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Second Rural Survey</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications was ordered to handle rural loans. The first survey has ended. Recently, a second survey team will be sent to the main agricultural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for a further detailed survey, and the results are attracting much attention from all parties. The focus of the survey is on rural transportation, finance, warehousing, production conditions, soil quality, and the lives of farmers. Once the survey is completed, it will be based on the actual situation, and Nanjing, Wuhu, Suzhou, and Jiaxing will be the focus areas for agricultural loans. Afterward, it will gradually expand to the counties, towns, and villages near the four major focus areas. In the first and second years of implementation, it is planned to focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans to increase the operating funds of small farmers' farmland, in order to increase the production per acre and net income, so as to transform farmland management from extensive to intensive, so that farmers' lives become more prosperous, and the rural economic situation is also improved. After one or two years, after the cooperative foundation is stable, it will then assist in the establishment of cooperative banks in various counties and cities, and assist in the establishment of agricultural warehouses at all levels attached to the cooperative system, so that the cooperative system and the agricultural warehouse network are smoothly coordinated.</p>
<h3>The Food and Economic Bureaus and Social Defense Prevent Cunning Merchants from Moving Materials Privately</h3>
<p>Since the central government has implemented wartime, in order to cooperate in completing the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, the investigation and punishment of merchants who violate regulations and move materials privately have been stipulated. In this city, except for the special zone, the Municipal Food and Economic Bureaus should be responsible for handling it, in order to prevent cunning merchants from evading materials. After receiving the order, the Municipal Food Bureau specially ordered all food-related public associations and district offices to take note of it.</p>
<h3>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival; All Industries Settle Accounts and Take a Day Off</h3>
<p>Today (7th) is the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar. All industries and businesses in the city follow the usual practice of settling accounts with customers. Stores, firms, factories, and companies send staff to collect payments, and banks and money shops also need to close out overdraft loans for various industries and businesses. Because the authorities provide as much capital as possible during the settlement period of the Dragon Boat Festival in order to stabilize the financial market, the funds of various industries are abundant despite the tight money supply, so the festival can be safely and steadily passed without any bankruptcies or closures. It is also learned that today (7th), all banks and money shops and groups and organizations such as the Commercial Control Commission will be closed for one day as usual.</p>

The Municipal Economic Bureau has examined and approved fifteen of them to resume business, and they have officially resumed trading. The other twenty stock companies, including Zhonghua, that are continuing to be approved have reportedly had staff sent by the Ministry of Public Works to unseal them. Each of these companies will resume business after the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.</p>
<h3>Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Applies for Rationing of Flour</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association has been actively promoting association affairs without sparing any effort. Members of the industry have been very enthusiastic about registering to join the association. Since the authorities issued an order stipulating that the noodle restaurant industry should also join the association, all noodle restaurant operators have also complied. However, there are still some industry operators who have not yet registered. The association has requested the Food Bureau to extend the registration deadline. Once approved, it will be announced in the newspaper. It is learned that the association, in view of the difficulty that industry members have in purchasing flour, has requested the Food Bureau and relevant authorities to allocate it reasonably to facilitate business. All members who have joined the association can enjoy this right. The association has formulated plans for the welfare of its members and is implementing them step by step. Those that have already been implemented include industry clinics, and others, such as the Tongren cram school, are being planned and prepared. Currently, the North China Emergency Relief Association has been established, and the association has also sent staff to attend. It is determined to do its best to promote and assist in fundraising. In addition, the association merged and reorganized the previous associations, and has been ordered by the authorities to cease activities and revoke its permits.</p>

<h3>Recommendation to Establish a Strong Economic Research Institute</h3>
<p>— Xu E</p>
<p>To solve and improve the entire national economic life, we must actively engage in economic construction. Since the National Government's participation in the war, the entire national economy of China. In politics, it is a period of cooperation in the Greater East Asia War; in economics, it is a period of actively reviving the economy from the destruction of war. In order to practice this arduous work, the Supreme National Defense Temporary Council has passed the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy for reference and implementation; but in order to seek effective implementation, there must be a complete plan, which depends on organized economic research work.</p>
<p>Economic research is very developed in the East Asian countries, but it only has more than 20 years of history in China. In this short history, in addition to the countless contributions of many economists' personal research, there are also several economic research institutions that have worked tirelessly and made valuable contributions. We further make ordinary observations, and feel that the economic research work has a trend of rapid development on the surface. All important public and private institutions attach importance to economic research, such as the various ministries and their affiliated institutions related to economic facilities, and even the provincial governments and their affiliated institutions, almost all have attached organizations such as various survey offices and statistics offices; and they are constantly being added. If only the unit is counted, the number of economic research institutions in China is probably more than that of the advanced countries. So it can be said that China's economic research institutions have developed in form; as for the actual contributions, they are far from the ideal state, but we cannot deny some valuable contributions; but this seems to be an exception. Generally speaking, the results of the work of many economic research institutions, which have indeed obtained valuable contributions, cannot be compared with the development in form.</p>
<p>After the Incident, many of these economic research institutions were shut down, and some were dispersed. The entire economic research work can be said to have fallen into a standstill. Since the National Government returned to the capital, industry and commerce have returned to normal, and some economic research institutions have recovered, and some have been newly established, and there is a vibrant atmosphere; but in terms of quantity, it is far less than before, we do not hope to be the same as before, treating economic research institutions as the facade of institutions and groups, what we need is quality and simplified economic research institutions. Now the government has the establishment of the National Economic Commission. According to its organizational regulations, it is set up to review economic policies and regulate economic administration. At present, the total war participation is in the stage of practice, and the economy is the driving force of the total war participation. During this period of war participation, on the one hand, we must ensure military needs, and on the other hand, we must stabilize people's livelihood. A strict economic plan is essential. Therefore, within the National Government Economic Commission, it is necessary to establish a strong economic research institution. In the private sector, although there are one or two economic research institutions with a rough scale, they cannot reach the ideal state due to various reasons; and they cannot undertake such arduous work, so we hope that this new economic research institution will be realized as soon as possible. It must be stated here that in order to save public funds, the scope of the administrative part of the original institution should be reduced as much as possible. At the same time, the principle of talent should be implemented, and real talents should be absorbed, and no one should be sent casually to fill the numbers. Such an economic research institution, I believe that the advanced economic research institutions of friendly countries will be able to sympathize and cooperate with it.</p>
<p>Finally, organized economic research work is really not an easy task, because research requires investigation, and there is a lack of investigative talents at the moment, so we have to rely on the collective efforts of most experts and scholars. However, the National Economic Commission must formulate a complete economic research plan, and if necessary, provide them with reference materials so that they can get the correct research direction, so that their research results can be contributed to the National Government for review and adoption. Starting from this complete and comprehensive economic plan, there will be no waste of resources, labor, and time.</p>
