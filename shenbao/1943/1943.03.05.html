<p>社評</p>
<h3>經濟動員與民間組織</h3>
<p>一昨論述參戰以後實現國民經濟總動員的重要性，和實現經濟動員必先建立民間組織，以協助政府從事於宣傳，解釋，指導，推動和考核工作的必要。但是這種組織應該如何組織，如何執行具體的工作，以配合，協同政府，而收圓滿的結果呢？</p>
<p>策進國民經濟動員工作的民間組織，在於補助政府實施戰時經濟政策綱領，推進國民經濟動員工作，並協助政府管制物價，徴發徴購，交通運輸，以鞏固國民經濟基礎。其主要任務在於（一）平定物價運價與工資一切設施之協助；（二）關於平定物價運價與工資實施業務的研究，並建議其改進；（三）關於增加生產與節約消費之促進與宣傳；（四）關於一般戰時生活的推動；（五）關於公債儲蓄及徴收物資的協助；（六）關於增進稅收，改革弊端，便利運輸及實施糧政的協助；（七）關於民力及一切勞動力動員之協助；（八）關於推進戰時工役之協助及養務勞動之提倡；（九）關於禁止走私與取締戰時暴利之協助；（十）關於推行戰時經濟政策綱領及其他經濟法令之調查與考核；（十一）關於戰時政策法令推行中一切舞弊　事之考察，以助政府作耳目；（十二）其他關於戰時經濟政策及法令由政府特別委任之事項。</p>
<p>在組織方面，政府可從民間選任各界公正人士，實業家，金融家，經濟政治文化方面的專家等為此民間組織的成員，就中公選若干人為常委，建立中央機構。並分全國為若干經濟動員地區，成立地區的民間機構。更就各省市縣選任社會領袖為地方組織的成員，各成員都須在組織的領導與方針之下，就前述名項任務中担任一項或數項，自行認定，就在其居住地址或服務地點進行其工作。在一定時期及必要時，須召集大會及各地區的會議，由常委負責與各級政府經濟政策法令推行的關係機關，保持密切的聯系與合作。為了工作的有效起見，並得組織調查團，研究會，宣傳組等，以展開其工作。為了有效的策動動員工作，在必要時，得徴詢有關機關人員，社團領袖，地方紳耆的意見，或召開懇談會，採集對管制及動員的意見及改進辦法，提請主管機關　意。並得接受人民或社團對於有關管制動員機關發生弊端之負責的舉發，進行調查，分別情節輕重，轉致各級政府或關係主管機關核辦。還可以分別約集各工廠，商行，運輸業及農工商各業社團舉行會談，聽取其對於管制與動員之報吿及意見，提供政府及主管機關參考。一方面與地方公正人士密切合作，一方面與政府及主管機關取得聯絡，而始終處於超然地位，俾得隨時向政府進言，消除政府與民間一切隔閡與誤會，而增進戰時經濟政策之實效。</p>
<p>戰時經濟政策之澈底實現，有待於人民全力之協助，我們理想中的民間組織，必須儘速成為事實。我們希望賢明的當局一定不會忽視這重要的建議。</p>

<h3>日本對華新政策</h3>
<p>因國民政府的參戰，日本對華政策發生劃時代的轉變。為使中國完成其自主獨立，加强國民政府的政治力，使中日結成一體，向完遂大東亞戰爭而邁進，故日本撤廢治外法權，交還租界。並在政治，經濟各方面予以有力的支援。關於這日本對華新政策的方針，靑木大東亞相在二十四日衆議院華北開發會社委員會席上，曾披瀝政府所持的見解。（文見三日本報）目前中外對此問題深為關心，為使一般國民得以充分理解，同時並使中國民衆依賴日本，此次的解釋收穫了很大的效果。</p>
<p>日本對中國的根本方針，在於尊重中國的自主獨立，使國民政府得以充分發揮其政治力，今毋須於此再加贅述。尤其是日本之切望中國自主獨立的完成，為近衛聲明以來一貫不變的方針。近年中國國民運動的主要目標之一，即為完成中國的自主獨立，脫離百年來半殖民地的地位。大東亞戰爭勃發後，汪主席深信唯有在大東亞戰爭中才能求得中國的自主獨立與東亞的解放，故決計與日本同甘共苦，全面的協力。繼而毅然布吿對英美宣戰，與日本同生共死，向擊滅英美而邁進。如此，中國的自主獨立，與中日兩國更趨緊密的提携，同時並進，終於促進其實現。</p>
<p>今後中日兩國的關係，必須互相尊重對方的立塲，關於此點，靑木大東亞相在議會中說明，國府方面為表示對日方的協力，在自覺的責任與創意之下，自動的發揮各種政務上的措施。至於日本方面，則嚴戒對其施政出以干涉的態度。充分的說明了日本對中國的政策，對國民政府的態度，是如何的公正。在這　明的事實之前，任何惡意的宣傳，都毫無價値。</p>
<p>為中國着想，為中國籌劃，日本的誠意，務使滲透於中國民衆的印象中。日本對華政策，用事實來昭示於中國民衆之前時，亦卽為重慶政權抗戰的根據被全體人民否定的日子。（翔：譯自二月二十七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>重光大使致辭</p>
<p>南京四日中央社電　關於交還租界、中日兩國委員協議席上、重光大使致詞、</p>
<p>為協議決定、關於實施交還租界、及撤廢治外法權之細目、中日兩國、曾於一月下旬各任命其委員、今日得於茲相會、而藉此機會、得向華方委員介紹我方之各委員、實為本使所引為欣幸者、</p>
<p>本委員係根據本年一月九日所締結之中華民國日本國間關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權等之協定第二條及第六條、而各各任命者是為週知之事實、此委員實負有着手實施中華民國多年宿望之任務、即為實施交還租界及撤廢治外法權之重要事業、本日中日兩方委員之聚首、實可謂為實現此重要事業之第一步、</p>
<p>中日兩國互相緊密協力以完遂共同之戰爭、實現復興及建設東亞之大業、並確立世界和平之基礎、中日兩國間、早已堅決矢誓、於此聖戰中、確立共同戰綫之中日兩國之委員、相聚一堂、以發揮協力親善之精神、深信為極有意義之事、</p>
<p>中國多年之宿望、現正開始實現中、此固為中國方面努力之所致、而日本得於完成上述宿望之第一步、即貢獻其協助、實為衷心所欣幸、兩國委員之任務、旣如前述、深望此種任務、能儘速獲致圓滿之成功、</p>
<p>褚外長之答詞</p>
<p>南京四日中央社電　兩國委員協議席上、褚主任委員答辭、中日兩國根據本年一月九日所簽定、關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權之協定、各任命委員、以協議決定其實施之細目、雙方委員、得於今日聚首一堂、作首次之協商、實為本人所深感欣幸者、</p>
<p>交還租界及撤廢治外法權、為完成中國獨立自主之必要條件、我國經數十年之努力奮鬥所未能完成者、今因貴國熱烈之援助、得使此歷史上之重大事業、係第一步之實施、實為每一中國人民所衷心欣感、不能自己者、</p>
<p>三年來貴國對於國民政府、於政治經濟軍事文化各方面、不斷的予以援助、而强化國府、成為貴國上下對華努力之目標、使我國於凋敝之餘、得能收拾殘局、努力復興、並能分担建設東亞新秩序之巨責、實深銘感、此次貴國更排除萬難、決心實施交還租界及撤廢治外法權、使中國能實現數十年來寤寐不忘之宿願、更為中日親　史上最光榮之一頁、重光大使閣下自蒞任以來、於援助國府、尤具熱誠、閣下珍貴之努力、於此重要之史實、實有顯著之功績、</p>
<p>中日兩國同心戮力以完遂大東亞戰爭、及建設東亞新秩序、余即早具堅强之決意、誓必貢其全力、以底於成、此次貴國政府協力吾國完成、上述重大之事業、尤足使我國益增信心與力量、中日兩國以此種精神與毅力、携手邁進、必能獲致勝利無疑、</p>
<p>今日聚首雖係本委員會之第一次會議、今後尚有待於協商者正多、但本以往及現在雙方親誠熱烈之精神、深信本委員會之任務、定能早日有圓滿之完成也、</p>
<p>南京四日中央社電　日重光大使於四日上午出席第一次交還租界及撤廢治外法權委員會後、即會見記者團發表感想如下、日本政府基於一月九日所締結之日華協定趣旨、即進行準備實行任命委員、而在今日舉行第一次交涉、日本所有之租界均係重要地點、故仍握有經濟上之中心、今後將全部移交、亦為協力中國發展政治經濟、此事自為中國朝野上下所熱望者、亦可　日本對改訂不平等條約最現實之舉、使於自己勢力範圍之內、不欲仍有租界之存在、此與各國所發空虛聲明、其性質完全不同、關於交還租界、將先就專管租界着手、惟此等地點、均極重要、故必須經協議種種手續、今後即進行此種交涉、此事及為實施日本最大方針之政策、其有現實的犧牲、當然亦在想像之中、但總以中日兩國將來着想、深願兩國關係日益發展、</p>

<h3>在渝美軍迭起內訌</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　美軍指揮系統之紊亂、與美軍軍紀之不整、早為各方所注意、最近美國泰晤士報週刋曾載文論述、駐渝美軍內部爭奪勢力情形甚詳、茲特譯如次、派渝美軍內部、已演出爭權奪勢之醜態、影響作戰殊鉅、暗鬥之主角為美遣渝空軍司令捷諾德中將與美遣派渝印軍司令官史蒂威爾中將、因捷諾德所部之空軍人員於過去五月內、曾在雲南戰區活動、然史蒂威爾輕視其事實、並「惟陸軍始能決定戰爭之勝敗」、另一原因為捷諾德與駐印美第十空軍司令官比塞爾中將之傾軋、美國義勇空軍多屬海軍、故對陸軍軍閥之比塞爾頗為厭惡、當義勇空軍隊解散編入正規軍時、　有五人留渝、其餘均撤退返國、又比塞爾最近曾派員赴重慶調查捷諾德軍隊內部情形、該特派員所作之報吿書與事實不符之處頗多、致引起對方之不滿、雙方裂痕愈行加深、又捷諾德希望有五百架空軍勢力、但渠之飛機均由比塞爾之印度空軍供給、彼認為其地位低於比塞爾殊為不滿、甚至美軍最高司令部對何人應指揮遣渝美空軍事、亦欠明瞭云、</p>
<h3>渝經濟崩潰情形　物資缺乏外援不繼</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　此間「東洋經濟」週刋、近曾載論指出渝方經濟之崩潰情形、異常詳盡、茲録大意如次、渝方近因物資缺乏、外援不繼、故一再要求美國强化援助、但均被置之不理、因此對美怨憤日趨顯著、蓋目下中國沿岸已悉為日軍嚴密封鎖、縝緬公路亦在日軍掌握之中、美方援渝欲取道海上、旣不可能、欲繞道北方、復因蘇重日辦條約精神堅持中立、拒絕假道、改現僅能經由印度以飛機運輸、然其數量之微少、自極明顯、自大東亞戰爭爆發後、渝方所有輸血路綫、已悉為日軍先後切斷、現渝方不僅武器至感缺乏、即一般物資、亦漸感不足、而將立趨深刻、現縱能由外獲得少許外援、亦無非為軍需武器、至於生產資材、日用消費品等之缺乏、仍無法解決、故因大東來戰爭之爆發、已使渝方益陷孤立、其戰時經濟之危機、乃亦益形深刻、此對於西南僻地之經濟、實為劃時代之惡現象、且因渝方濫發紙幣、以及上海南京等資金無法流入、乃使孤立中之渝方戰時經濟、更趨惡劣、紐約時報駐渝特派員曾謂、「目下渝方經濟情形之惡化、實較軍事方面之失敗為尤甚」、又謂、「渝方將來若一旦崩潰、則必因惡性通貨膨脹而造成經濟之總崩潰」、而去年威爾基、曾以　斯福特使之資格、訪問渝方、渠亦曾於十月七日謂、「軍時間題及財政與通貨膨脹問題、實同為渝方當前之二大難題、若不從速設法防止通貨膨脹、則渝方必將遭重大損害」云、而今日渝方物價指數、若以事變當時之民國二十六年一月至六月之物價、平均指數作為一零零、而其後仍日益增高、由此可知渝方惡性通貨膨脹之情况、至為顯然、而渝方之經濟崩潰、亦成為不可避免之事實、因此美國今後為期繼續利用渝方、自須擴大以物資援渝、但當茲援渝路綫完全斷絕之時、縱令渝美雙方如何設法增加武器但與預定額或締結指借款協定、均無法補於實際、渝方終將於孤立之中、趨於經濟崩潰之途、</p>

<h3>潛艇戰日益加緊　英感受嚴重威脅　船艦損失重大補充困難　英政府正考慮應付對策</h3>
<p>里斯本四日同盟社電　據倫敦來電　瑞海相亞力山大三日於下院說明提出海軍預算案之意義、略謂、英國及各自治領海軍、於過去一年間已經歷最大之艱險、自日本參戰後、海戰激烈異常、又因太平大西兩洋之海運、時時遭受軸心潛艇及空軍之攻擊、是以一向在大西洋方面担當海運護送之英國艦隊、一部乃不得不遠涉其他洋面、且因迭次從事大規模之海戰、故英國艦隊已蒙受相當損害云、</p>
<p>瑞士京城四日哈瓦斯社電　倫敦電、英國海相亞力山大昨在下字宣佈最近海軍之損失、計有（一）某護航隊於開往蘇聯途中、損失巡洋艦二艘·驅逐艦十艘·其他軍艦十艘·及貨船多艘、（二）運輸接濟品前往馬爾太島時、損失巡洋艦三艘·航空母艦二艘·驅逐艦九艘·及商船多　、至於潛水艇之危機、軸心國現正大量製造、其數量當在協約國所能擊毀者之上云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日海通社電　英海相亞力山大昨在下院宣稱、英國現已有一種新式護航艦、在海上服務、較平面戰艦重而快云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　前次德軍司令部曾發表謂　德軍在二月份共擊沉反軸心船舶五十四萬五千噸、故目下英國為應付潛艇對於快速船之建造案逐漸有力、如英運輸相李寒　曾於二日在上院聲稱、快速船之建造、雖需要一倍半之勞力與資材、但英政府決於不妨碍軍需生產之範圍內、努力建造多數快速船、現在建造中之遠洋航路船　有　分之一為高速船云、又英首相邱吉爾前於二月十二日亦曾在下院中宣稱、英政府現正努力建造護送艦艇、以為適應破壞戰之對策云、美國下院海軍委員會中、亦曾通過建造或改造百萬噸補助艦艇案之取自約十億萬元、據華盛頓來電、最近之泰晤士週刋曾就該問題表明見解稱、美國各地造船所、因實行龐大之造船計劃、已深感資材困難、然對護送船艦並未作任何等努力、計劃亦十分遲緩、迄今僅建造少數之驅逐艦、但運輸船三艘、常需驅逐艦一艘保護、然目前運輸船與驅逐艦之比例、僅為十五與一、縱欲從速建造護送艦艇、資材亦頗感缺乏、此項護送艦艇不足之責任、實皆為海軍部當局疏忽及估計錯誤云、</p>

<h3>唐納資河流域　德軍反攻獲大捷　斯拉維安斯克被佔領　蘇坦克車隊突圍未逞</h3>
<p>柏林四日同盟社電　此間官方昨夜宣布、德軍在卡科夫東南反攻、已於星期二在唐納資河上游及中游渡河、兩軍正在卡柯夫東南一百英里之巴拉克萊耶地方進行激戰、大　蘇聯戰車屢擬突圍均未得逞、</p>
<p>德元首行營四日海通社電　今午德軍戰報稱、德軍佔領頓河區內卡科夫東南之斯拉維安斯克、又包圍卡科夫迤南之蘇聯坦克車隊第三軍、德軍數帥、現在唐納資中部及唐納資河上游、大舉進攻、戰綫長達二百五十公里、庫斯克西北區內、昨續有戰事、蘇軍又分數批、進犯奧勒爾西北德軍之陣地、敵損失慘重、不支而退、</p>
<p>柏林四日海通社電　此間今日透露、斯拉維安斯克被佔後、德軍現已在唐納資二百五十公里闊之陣綫上獲得一立足點、同時蘇軍向唐納資盆地及烏克蘭方面之突破已被遏阻、蘇軍在該地進攻之猛烈、爲一九四二年至一九四三年冬季攻勢之中心、現則因東綫南路之大雨與泥濘、蘇軍不得不於未達目地前、即已放棄進攻之企圖、東綫南路之戰事雖受天時所阻、但德軍之反攻進行甚爲順利、庫斯克西北之防守戰仍在繼續中、蘇軍在奧勒爾西北之猛攻昨被德軍擊退、敵方損失慘重、</p>
<p>柏林四日海通社電　此間今日宣佈被德軍佔領之斯拉維盎斯克、位於頓河流域、係於德軍最近在唐納資中部與卡科夫迤南發動反攻時所攻佔、被困於卡科夫迤南之蘇軍一大隊突圍未逞、其一部已被殲滅、同時德軍之包圍日益加緊、又德軍昨在庫彭橋頭與米烏斯戰綫、再度擊退蘇軍局部之進攻、</p>
<p>柏林四日海通社電　東綫戰局發展至今、蘇軍已知無法久守唐納資與卡科夫南面及西北各地、故今擬向諾夫哥洛德之庫斯克西北突進、藉以恢復其戰略上之均勞、但目前尙未見其收獲成效、蘇軍奪取奧勒爾德軍陣地之企圖、已爲德軍反攻制住、卡科夫西北敵軍仍在繼續撤退中、德軍已能將其主力切斷、關於包圍波爾泰伐一事、今已不再蘇方發出此項消息、</p>
<p>爾齊夫化爲廢墟　德撤退戰術巧妙</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日同盟社電　據東綫消息稱、德軍二日自爾齊夫撤退後、東綫中北部之戰鬬已吿一段落、德軍自第米雅斯克至爾齊夫間突出陣地撤退後、因防線縮短、防備益聓固、今後德軍戰略當亦形好轉、德軍此次撤退戰術極爲巧妙、德軍後衛部隊於二日黃昏將市內民房五千所及其他防禦物悉數破壞、並將郊外橋樑焚毀後、乃從容撤退云、</p>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地四日哈瓦斯社電　過去二十四小時、東綫戰事至爲劇烈、其主要發展有三、即（一）中路德軍已自爾齊夫城撤退、（二）紅軍向庫斯克城西面挺進、（三）南路德軍繼續在唐納資河流域反攻有所進展、茲彙誌詳情如下、（一）南路西高加索方面、雙方正在諾伏洛西斯克城附近互相砲戰、庫彭區北部亦有猛烈戰事、羅斯托夫－泰幹洛格一綫、並無重大發展、但米烏斯河一綫仍有戰事、德軍除在斯拉維安斯克至伏羅希洛夫格勒一帶、繼續反攻外、並忙於將若干處紅軍殘餘部隊、予以肅清、（二）柏林宣佈、卡科夫城西面若干紅軍部隊、已被包圍、但莫斯科方面、則謂戈里柯夫將軍所部、已開抵卡科夫－勃里昂斯克鐵路綫、而將勒哥夫城佔領、自勒哥夫城至特米脫里勒伏斯克城、全綫計長廿五英里、紅軍正沿此綫推進中、大抵紅軍統帥部仍用一慣戰略、擇攻德軍陣綫最弱之點、至紅軍攻勢目標、是否欲自南北兩面、夾攻科諾托浦城、（適在庫斯克至卡科夫之中間）、此際尙難確言之、（三）奧勒圍區紅軍加緊進迫、據莫斯科消息、傳已將該城迤南二十英里之卓台多伏鎭佔領、（該鎭有鐵路直達庫斯克）、但德方自稱已在該方面有所戒備、並已派遣生力部隊前往增援、（四）中路爾齊夫城、原爲德軍陣綫之凸出點、故其撤退原屬意料中事、惟無人能知德方已在絕對秘密中全師而退、故其突然放棄之速、初非外間所能計及、德方自稱此舉使紅軍大爲詫異、觀於紅軍延至德方退走兩小時後、始行開入、即其明證、顧蘇聯方面則謂、係在劇戰之後、始將該城佔領、並奪得大批戰利品、無讑如何、紅軍在近日戰報中、旣從未提及爾齊夫城、可見該處戰事、實甚短促、此外丁莫生柯上將所部、則仍在羅伐特河一帶加緊壓迫云、</p>
<p>德國衝鋒隊司令　阿埃克將軍陣亡</p>
<p>柏林四日海通社電　昨日宣佈、衝鋒隊阿埃克將軍在東綫指揮坦克車師作戰、業已陣亡、</p>
<p>柏林四日海通社電　在東綫陣亡之德裝甲部隊司令阿埃克將軍、現年五十一歲、係亞爾薩斯人、一九一九年擢升衝鋒警衛隊將軍、一九三九年將該隊編爲衝鋒隊師團、法國戰役中在阿拉斯及岡勃雷建立突圍偉功、一九四一年夏該師在東綫突破斯達林防綫、因得閃雷師團之號、阿氏於某次曾衝入蘇地雷陣而受傷、至一九四一年秋傷未全愈、即又親赴前綫指揮、一九四二年四月二十一日獲橡葉武士鐵十字章、</p>
<p>德蘇戰局前途</p>
<p>（柏林特電二十日大島特派員發）德國大本營公布，德軍破壞羅斯托夫，伏洛希洛夫爾市之軍事設施後，即行有計劃的放棄。此爲繼斯達林格勒後之第二次撤退，從戰略上看來，斯達林格勒之撤退，早已暗示羅斯托夫今日之命運。此一局面若單獨視之，固爲目前戰局之中心點，但從全局考察起來，不能視爲敗北之記錄，蓋不惜　牲而加以死守，在第三次之攻勢準備上，是否得　、値得愼重考慮。同時，斯達林格勒之孤軍，爲使大軍獲退容易完成，故獻呈其可貴之生命爲祖國戰至最後一點血，而全局的勝負，遂由此得出結論。</p>
<p>是以我人對此現實不容加以輕視，撤退雖視爲兵家常事，但因撤退而產生之人與物的損失，則不能不加以計較。自北高加索出動之李斯特軍團，其一向羅斯托夫，另一自達曼越海峽向克里米半島，據記錄以每日六十公里之速度向後撤退。此一行動，可視爲避免蹈斯達林格勒之覆轍而實施有計劃的撤退。</p>
<p>自哈里哥夫南方企圖隨時截斷其退路之西軍，南下軍無法加以阻止。目下德大部隊正率領該地方之居民同時撤退。一面，在哈里哥夫地區戰綫，正發生近代機動部隊之混戰。德軍西攻者有之，紅軍東進者亦有之。因紅軍之攻勢，使德軍不能不爲整理南方之作戰基地而逐漸撤退。紅軍之第二次冬季攻勢，不惜人力物力之犧牲作孤注一擲之壯舉，國內預備軍業已加入第一綫，武器亦不問新舊盡數加以使用。</p>
<p>目前的戰綫，在中南部，大槪仍爲德軍第二次攻勢前之綫，假使紅軍有渡過特尼愛普洛貝脫羅夫斯克，薩勃洛奇之危險，則德軍之撤退將爲：</p>
<p>（一）以特尼愛普爾河之自然的防禦地形爲最前綫。</p>
<p>（二）爲延長紅軍之兵站線，使其戰門力受到某程度之限制，故即令犧牲烏克蘭之半部，亦將繼續撤退至該綫。</p>
<p>北部戰綫，自去年三月以來，即已築成堅固陣地，故今日該地之戰事爲拉鋸戰，假定此綫並無變化，則二個月之後的對峙線，連貫南北約二千公里，於紅軍第二次攻勢前約緊縮一半之地點，暫時趨於膠着。</p>
<p>迄今爲止，德蘇戰中所證明之雙方戰爭原則，德爲夏攻冬守，蘇爲夏退冬進，故不能即行判斷其對於全體的進退所及　影響。但德軍第三次攻勢，論者以爲因準備與時間關係，將大爲困難，其實不然。此次之動員，鑒於兵力之移動，軍需工塲之活躍，及軸心國軍隊之動向，足可提供不容否定之證明。關於東部戰綫，問題之主要者將爲：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯此次攻勢之發動，因食糧問題之緊迫，故企圖奪回烏克蘭以準備持久戰態勢。故其攻勢今後能否繼續？</p>
<p>（二）烏拉爾以東之工業能力，及鐵石炭等重要資源，是否能支持今後之長期消耗戰？</p>
<p>（三）德國所有力量的比重如何？</p>
<p>對此諸點若加以檢討，可得種種結論。但第二次世界大戰自本年以來，即在歐洲已有北菲，西亞及其他重要因素參加；同時，全體的戰局，亦因政治要素之插入而愈增其複雜性。（翔：譯自二月二十二日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>瑞士京城三日哈瓦斯社電　據輪心國及英美方面消息、突尼西亞前綫昨以南部及空中戰事較爲劇烈、馬萊斯綫兩軍對峙形勢仍無變更、此外則有猛烈砲戰及斥堠戰、英國軍事專家以爲德軍防綫係在西部、該處馬特馬泰山中有山道數處可通、至於加勃斯梅特寧鐵路則係德軍之生命綫、英軍航空隊正在集中轟炸、因之德軍運輸常在夜間爲之、據北非協約軍司令部宣佈、法軍已佔領加薩夫西面五十英里之泰母柴、美軍則在弗林那區略有進展、惟軸心軍所退出之陣地遍敷地雷、協約軍進展因之大見遲緩、突尼西亞北部德軍仍在皮耶及梅傑埃爾巴勃方面乘勝推進、軸心飛機每夜轟炸特利波里及波那兩港甚爲猛烈、英美飛機則亦襲擊拉高勒及突尼斯港、</p>

<p>梵蒂岡四日海通社電　接近梵蒂岡之人士稱、紐約大主敎史貝曼之訊問羅馬、自必負有特殊任務、殆係羅斯福企圖爭取外交行動之援助、擁護美英蘇在歐洲及地中海之作戰目的、故史氏此行、必係出於羅斯福之主動、羅斯福且欲利用史氏與敎廷之談判、進行其下屆總統選舉之宣傳活動、故衆信史氏所負之使命、必較戲樂爲重大、綜計史氏在梵蒂岡逗留十二日、謁見敎皇五次、共約會談六小時、至其會談內容、則極守秘密、甚至梵蒂岡之高級當局亦不得而知、但據消息靈通人士稱、梵蒂岡態度公正、似未使贊許交戰國任何一方之作戰目的、且認爲加薩勃朗加宣言、要求三國公約國家無條件降服一節、乃與基督敎原理完全觗觸、幷聞史氏曾促梵蒂岡改變對蘇態度、但有一事可以忠吿史貝曼者、即歐洲秩序性德義政權繼續存在、始能加以保障云、</p>

<h3>從重慶到華盛頓</h3>
<p>— 焦雲</p>
<p>沿途經過印度非洲　全程約須二十餘日</p>
<p>自滇緬路中斷，重慶國際路綫改道印度之後，人多以交通阻塞爲慮，近有客赴美國歸來，談旅途經過甚詳，頗足供未親身跋涉者參考。</p>
<p>（印非途中）在中印公路尙未完成之今日，由渝赴印，有仰賴飛機，高山雖多，並無阻礙，大約中午由渝起飛，當夜十時即可到達加爾各答，數千里航程，需時僅十餘小時，加爾各答爲印度交通中心，貿易繁盛，爲印度第一大都會，有「印度倫敦」之稱。此地生活尙不甚昂貴，印幣十數元即可解決食宿問題。惟有一事須注意者，即法幣不能通用於該地，須換使印度盧幣，而盧幣之購買，又以在渝爲宜，因加爾各答盧幣兌換價格較高。由加爾各答至美，本有直達飛機，但班期規定，乘搭不便，而印度西岸之卡拉其飛機甚多，故人多乘火車至卡拉其後，再換乘飛機。火車由加爾各答至卡拉其，橫貫全印，路基平坦，途中經過印度首府新德里，建築宏大之英總督府，瞭然在目。三日抵卡拉其，人數不多，隨時均可乘搭飛機，至開羅，由卡拉其起飛途經波斯頓口，伊拉克等地，並掠海峽而過。此一段路多風，飛機顚播不穩，行人頗以爲苦，行二日始抵開羅，開羅位於尼羅河三角洲上，近郊古蹟甚多，舉世聞名之金字塔，即屹立於斯，塔遠建於六千年前，大者高數白尺，凡至埃及者莫不前往憑弔。</p>
<p>由卡拉其至開羅，均爲英國飛機，自開羅後換乘美國飛機，此數日如飛行大海上，茫茫一片，不見人烟樹木，惟見平沙漠漠，因係飛行於非洲瀚海上空也。漸往西飛，始見非洲，約五日到達尼日利亞之拉各斯，恍如另一新世界，滿目所見，盡皆欣欣向榮之色。該地設備近代化，街市繁華，現代用具應有盡有，若非其人民面皆黑色，使人疑置身欧美。</p>
<p>（渡大西洋）自此以後，乘搭飛剪號飛機，極爲舒適，僅一日即抵巴西之維塔爾市，以前所見，多爲幹燥之地，至此始人淸涼境界。此地日爾數次，人民衣冠頗爲整齊，街市亦甚淸潔，惟民多操葡萄牙語，英語反不懂，旅客頗感不便。再前航空大站爲巴西之　蘭，乃一古老都市。更前一站，爲英國蜀特立尼達島，過此前往即入美境內，飛機在美最先停落之地爲南端之邁阿密，此地氣候溫暖，美人多在此避寒，長年均有人游泳，由此至華盛頓仍可飛機，亦有火車通行，火車行駛極快，約一日即達華府。</p>
<p>總計全段旅程，約需時三十天左右，至於飛機票價，三四月間，由渝至加爾各答需三千五百餘元，由印至美約需二千美元，今則不祇此數矣，由印至美尙有一條路，即由　買乘船是也，惟內戰事方面，船隻多在　輸軍火之用，客船　有，如能設法搭運軍火回　　船，則花一二千元，費時一二月，亦可抵美，並非如想像之困難，惟出國者須事先辦好各地入境簽字證，否則沿途　不勝其煩擾。（三十二年一月十日寄）</p>
<h3>日軍進駐廣州灣追記　日法雙方簽訂協定</h3>
<p>日本陸軍的精銳，鼓着勇氣推進，一舉攻佔了雷州半島，二月二十日突入廣州灣法國租借地的邊界寸金橋，消滅了重慶軍的蠢動企圖，日軍紀　　明，不肯貿然侵犯境界綫，駐屯在一定距離的地點，當日軍經過麻章迫近寸金橋，就有集中在那裏的渝軍企圖來邀擊，可是因爲日軍的疾進，渝軍竟不遑應戰就潰退四散了。</p>
<p>事前到廣州灣去作外交上折衝的〇〇陸軍大佐和法國方面涉委員潘尼上尉，在二十日下午四點半到寸金橋來迎接部隊長，部隊長從容不迫，寒喧一兩句後，就趁了特地預備歡迎部隊長的汽車，在全部將士列隊致敬中開到租借地內，部隊長到了之後就和法國租借地州長官德謀克氏開始正式交涉，雙方立刻成立諒解，二十一日就在當地簽字。</p>
<p>二十一日上午十一點（日本時間）簽字的那一天，是在州長官邸舉行，先由德謀克長官起立致辭，恭祝日本的隆昌和東亞的安定，繼由部隊長强調日法問的友好關係，希望法國方面密切協力，再由○○陸軍大佐朗讀共同防衛廣州灣法國租借地的協定條文，然後由○○中尉把它譯成法語，再讀一遍，在雙方同意中，就由部隊長和德謀克長官簽字，日法兩國各執一份。</p>
<p>留駐在寸金橋的一部份部隊，二十一日下午二點半，在法國方面完全諒解之下，開始進駐寸金橋對岸的赤坎市，在橋畔和法方守備兵交歡，沿途的民衆夾道歡呼，軍容整齊，經過市內大街，在市外西端的體育塲稍息之後，又在市內大街周行一圈，下午四時，回到寸金橋的現在駐留地。</p>
<p>廣州灣的市民，莫不讚佩日本軍的威容，中日法三國的友好，益加敦睦，廣州灣內的敵性份子，大都逃往內地，治安完全恢復。（任：譯自二月二十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<p>雷州半島登陸成功</p>
<p>（廣州灣二十三日專電）二月十六日，明月皎潔之下，日本軍在雷州東海岸奇襲登陸，同時又佔領雷州半島，渝方驚惶失措，日本軍得悉第七戰區余漢謀部下的第一百五十五師和第四戰區張發奎的三師主力，正在向遂漢縣城開調，日軍佔領雷州後不遑喘息，立刻北上追擊，向遂溪猛撲，那一帶道途崎嶇，後方不能接濟，所以必須携帶大量的食量弱藥。</p>
<p>渝軍看到日軍這樣緊追不捨，自知已無生路，所以不想再逃，拚命反攻，到處展開小接觸，可是日本軍英勇進擊，一刻不停，越過戰綫一百五十公里，始終不曾休息片刻，在大無畏的勇敢精神下，終於克服了萬難，在十九日下午四時，衝進了遂溪縣城。（任：譯自二月二十五日東京朝日新聞)</p>

<h3>組織教師福利會</h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>誰都知道，目今社會上責任最重酬報最薄的職業，首得推爲敎師了。所以有許多有經騐有學識的敎師們，因爲待遇菲薄，生活不易維持，都紛紛拋棄了敎鞭，投身入他種職業。於是學校方面因爲師資缺乏，便不得不將那些並沒有作敎師資格的人拉來凑數，因此造成了近來學生程度日趨低落的不良狀態，何怪有人要出來大呼「整頓師資」了。</p>
<p>這嚴重的問題，近來社會各方面也似乎遂漸注意起來了。醫師爲敎師義務診病，商店和工廠爲敎師减低貨品售價，報館爲敎師收受熱心者的各種助金，這一般人，他們同情敎師，知道敎師的不能安於其位是社會的重大損失，所以願盡力幫助敎師，略减他們生活上的重負，其用心的懇摯和目光的正確是値得感佩的，不過因爲各自爲政的緣故，種種事情未免顯得散漫而缺乏整個的系統。而且敎師是屬於知識階級而有辦事能力的人，事實上也似乎不宜久處於被動的地位，應該本身有一個完善的組織，利用團體的力量，集合各種助力，使發揮出最大的效率，普澤於全市每一個敎師。因之，筆者才有組織敎師福利會蒭議。</p>
<p>組織的方法，可先由幾個較著名的學校聯名具函全市每一學校，令推派代表，選舉辦事人員，籌備組織，各校敎師便爲當然會員。辦事的會所，則爲節省開支起見，可附設於地位較廣的學校。</p>
<p>這會的宗旨，旣然在於集合社會上各種助力，保障敎師生活的安定，簡接提高敎學上的效率，所以將來會務的進行，當依着下列各方面斟量增减：</p>
<p>（一）徵求各科醫生爲敎帥及其家屬義務診治和接生，使患病及生產時能免除醫藥費的負担。</p>
<p>（編者按本報創設小學敎師醫藥助金，即本此意，截至目下爲止，已有多數熱心人士，慷慨捐助，並有多數名醫及醫院，訂定優待診治辦法，其有裨於敎師健康，自非淺鮮。關於小學敎師醫藥助金消息，均載本報社會服務欄，希各注意。）</p>
<p>（二）徵求各商店及工廠的低價貨品，以减輕敎師們生活上的負担。</p>
<p>（三）對於各種日用統制品，直接請求當局配給，平均分配與全體會員。</p>
<p>（四）請求各校增設敎師子弟免費及减費學額，如所人之校不設此種學額，則斟與一部或全部資助。</p>
<p>（五）設立貸金，敎師如遇婚喪大故時，可向會方申請。以後則不起利息，陸續分期拔還。</p>
<p>至於經濟的來源，愚意可從下列各方面獲得：</p>
<p>（一）請求社會局及工部局華人敎育處津貼。</p>
<p>（二）請求各熱心劇團，票房等義務演劇募集。</p>
<p>（三）由各會員分別向親友閒捐募。</p>
<p>（四）請報館代收同情者的捐款。</p>
<p>以上是筆者的一點粗見，拋磚引玉，詳細的辦法還待有識之士繼續展開討論。</p>

<p>日駐滬陸軍報道部發言人、於昨（四）日下午二時、在規定每星期四招待新聞記者席上、向記者團闡明日軍自大東亞戰爭開始後變更作戰指導方針、談話如下、</p>
<p>變更方針</p>
<p>日發言人談關於日軍之變更作戰指導方針「當自民國二十九年起、直至大東亞戰爭開始止，其作戰方針、採用畢斯登策略、隨時出擊渝軍據點、以粉碎渝方循利用滇緬路之接濟、再作總反攻之夢想、在大東亞戰爭開始後、渝方即已喪失其培養渝軍之滇緬公路、絕無實施總反攻之力量，因變更以前作戰之指導方針、其目的計（一）撒底擊壞渝方抗戰力量、（二）爲確保完成大東亞戰爭之目的、積極開拓與培養國府所在地域之政治力量及經濟力量、茲舉首次之例如下、日軍在去年實施浙贛作戰、分浙東金華蘭溪武義等地、不但至今仍確保治安、並培養國府政治經濟、對開發資源、在大東亞戰爭上助力之鉅、至於此次武漢蘇淮兩方之作戰、也具同樣之意義、就武漢方面言、確保岳州至宜昌揚子江東岸地區、由中日兩國軍隊維護治安、國府因以政治力量益臻充實培養、關於蘇淮方面淮安及蘇北各地、將開始淸鄉工作、</p>
<p>發展思想</p>
<p>日發言人表示、吾人要能發展此作戰指導思想、則整個湖南四川、當可從而確保、同時發展開拓交通路綫思想、則爲貫通浙贛路綫直達越南滇緬公路之作戰、當必從而展開、然如何確立此項思想、如欠缺充分力量、當難以實現、所以日本正全力協助國府充分發揮軍力政治力、能與日本之作戰想想吻合、亦惟其如此、然後能實現建設新中國、綜觀此次蘇淮武漢作戰上國府軍險確保維護治安、足証國府力量已增强、而中國參戰之意義於此可見、</p>
<p>美方行動</p>
<p>敝人對以上之事、頗表忻慰、然渝方對日軍此項作戰指　之觀察、則完全錯誤、竟誤認日軍在滇緬綫作戰之目的、爲牽制渝軍恢復原有路綫、故目前偷方軍事當局、特在滇緬境調遣相當軍隊、同時復與印境之英當局協商共同反攻之辦法、實則日軍在雲南之作戰目的、完全與大東亞戰爭之目的相同、故日軍對滇之渝軍及對印緬國境之英印軍實施攻擊、最後謹舉引下列事實、供給各位作爲參考、依據美當局發表之租軍案、於去歲一年米、援助反軸心國家資材、計輸送渝方物資、共卅六艘、供給蘇聯物資三百另四艘、運輸英國物資一千四百四十五艘、同時美下議院對此事曾發表演說、提出質詢、謂估計美國援渝物資、僅百分之二、而援英物資、則竟達百分之六十七、由此可見美援助渝物資頗爲困難、渝方希望完全失敗、」</p>

<h3>南洋各地特輯之五　東印度滄桑記（五）</h3>
<p>— 喬松</p>
<p>（六）荷印華僑的勢力</p>
<p>外國資本侵入荷印，多從栽培業而傾向鑛業，再侵入工業部門。最近荷印工業資本有下述兩種現象。</p>
<p>其一，荷印之近代　的工業，是由外國資本（包含荷蘭）和華僑資本建設起來的，其中主要的是織布工業，此外是馬達工廠，車胎工廠等等。這種近代的工業資本中，荷蘭資本約占一五——一六％，華僑資本約占二二——二三％，其餘爲英美資本。</p>
<p>其二，手工業的經營規模漸趨擴大，而道一部門的經營者就是華僑，其資力有由家庭工業轉向工廠制手工業的趨勢，由於荷印的工業化尙在極幼稚的階段，所以列强的投資於工業，遠較投資於農業及鑛業爲微小，而手工業的大權，便握在華僑手裏了。</p>
<p>前任荷印經濟部長亨莫克氏就曾說：「荷屬東印度工業的發展，須靠荷蘭人，印度亞西亞人和中國人互相協力，强調華僑對於東印度經濟發展中所占重要的地位。也可以看出數百年來中國貧苦階級向海外發展的成就，他們經過了艱苦的奮鬥，祖傳其父，父傳其子，忍辱負重，終於在海外建立牢固不可動搖的經濟的地位，連殖民的强國也不能不嘆服和承認！</p>
<p>東印度的華僑人數，現在已不算少，爪哇有五十八萬二千人，外領各島約六十萬七千人，約計共有一百十八萬九千人，他們由於刻苦耐勞，由於最能與土著民族親善相處，終於在農業，手工業，新工業和地方商業上掌握到實權。使中國人雖遠在海外，而舉目所見，還無異在本　！</p>
<p>推考歷史，中國和爪哇的貿易往來，還遠在荷蘭人到爪哇以前，去今至少已有一千年以上了。這些華僑，最大多數是只在都市附近從事於商業，一部份從事於農工，毫無政治陰謀，也沒有經濟獨占的企圖一，因此也眞正成爲東印度的友一好民族和侵略性的英美帝國主義完全不同。</p>
<p>僑胞的人口，在爪哇僅次於土農民族而居於第二位的大多數，主要的經營　業是食品，日用百貨，金銀，陶磁器，玻璃，琺瑯裝品，棉布，脚踏車等的零售商人，也有基礎更較鞏固的，從事於對土著民族收買土產，以及農莊等時經營。大東亞戰爭以後，日本完全佔領東印度，華僑和日本人的握手才見之事實。</p>
<p>（七）畸形的貿易狀況</p>
<p>從世界大戰爆發以來的荷印輸出人賈易形勢來看，美國在荷印輸出入總額中都占首位，呈現非常的躍進狀態，新加坡居第二位，這裏當然包括着對中國的貿易；荷蘭本國降落爲第三位。（統計數字依據同前）</p>
<h3>為減少給養費用　慈善團體內移　五百難童還至蘇州等地　成績優良現擬繼續仿辦</h3>
<p>本市慈善團體五所、連同原斯收容之難童約五百名、爲遵循全國慈幼協會改善本市難童生活情狀之計劃、巳於過去二個月中、遷移至鄉區、尤以蘇州爲最、其目的不僅在减緩難童在生活程度高漲下所感之恐慌、亦可部份解决若干慈善團體經濟之困難、</p>
<p>減少給養費用</p>
<p>查鄉區物價較上海為低、故將難童移往鄕區、可减少給養費用、查目下上海所有收容之難童數在三四千人之譜、故五百人之移往鄉區、僅爲初步之試行方針、此後勢將加速進行、每一難童在上海之給義、每月至少二百元、如遷至蘇州、一百二十元已足、在已遷移離滬之五慈善團體中、其中移至安亭、另一移至大塲、其餘則遷至蘇州、</p>
<p>空氣有益健康</p>
<p>難童移至鄕區後、不僅在給養上可以節省、即鄕間之空氣與陽光、於難童健康、亦屬有益、據稱因最近募得之一項計十萬元、漸趨用罄、故必須儘量設法彌補、以應付日漲不已之生活程度、又須撙節用途、此不得不將一部份慈善團體內移、觀其成效、是否優良、日來屢接蘇州、大塲及安亭方向之報吿、難童生理及心理上、日有進步之象、故以後尙擬將慈善機關繼續內移也、</p>

<h3>努力謀取　中日融和提携　拌野氏發表抱負</h3>
<p>在培養決戰，準備決戰目標下所產生之各產業共榮會，統計參加者有中日兩方產業戰士五十餘萬人。舉凡工業生產方面之工作，推進尤力。中支產業共榮聯合會爲各產業共榮會之領導推進機關，最近委中支那振興會社理事伴野淸氏任事務局長。頃承伴野氏發表今後之計劃與抱負如次：</p>
<p>國府參戰後，華方傾全力從事於中日經濟提携與培養戰力工作，對此誠擊日方尤深欽佩，更不得不誠心協力以助成中國之工作。中支產業共榮聯合會，即爲其實踐運動。吾人之任務將愈益重大。真正之中日融合，在於個人與個人間之融合。服務於職業界之中日人士爲謀個人與個人間之融合，遂有單位產業共榮會之產生。職業界之融合，即成國家之融合。中日人士同心一體，實行同生共死之精神，即能促成中日經濟合作，且能擴充生產力量。擬根據　項方針，總動員華中各地之單位共榮會，一致努力完成大東亞戰爭。因此考慮在各地設立聯絡機　，以便加强能率。（三月四日大陸新報）</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>推廣我國農業金融　應由國家銀行倡導</h3>
<p>民以食爲天，故一切經濟問題，皆以糧政爲先。吾國以農立國，而農政不修，農民經濟，至今日而益困。據二十一年主計處統計，全國農戶共五千八百五十六萬九千一百八十一戶，佔全民戶百分之七四·五，若以全國人口四萬萬計，則百分之七四·五共有農民約三萬萬人。是我國之農業問題，直接的爲三萬萬人之經濟問題，整個的尤爲四萬萬人之生活問題。我國人口雖衆，而土地之利用甚爲貧乏。又據二十一年國府主計處統計，全國除靑海，西康，廣西，新疆十縣，雲南四縣，黑龍江一縣，及貴州一縣外，僅有田地十二萬四千八百七十八萬餘畝，而其餘部份荒地，達二十餘萬萬畝。據名家推算，國人平均每人約得三畝，加以苛捐　稅，災禍頻仍，農具陳腐，耕種幼稚，是以農業生產之不足，爲自然之結果，而提倡改進，乃爲急不容緩之事。</p>
<p>欲改進農業經濟，當先自推廣農業金融始。然農業金融與共他工商金融，性質特殊，非一般商業金融機國所能爲，所願爲，茲先述農業金融之特質及其困難如下：</p>
<p>（一）農業金融非如工商金融之週轉。蓋商品易於流動，而農業資金，用於下種者須俟半年一年後收穫時，方得還款，其用於改良土地者，長至十年數十年。</p>
<p>（二）農業金融之擔保，較上商金融爲呆滯。</p>
<p>（三）農業金融之利息，以農民不能負擔高利，故不能提高。而工商金融，商家力能負擔高利。</p>
<p>（四）農業金融須格外注意於用途，蓋農業金融之性質，不僅在金錢之救濟，而　貴對農民能加以種種之指導。</p>
<p>（五）農業金融放款方法，不如工商金融之簡單，故須有特殊之機構，如合作社之組織等。</p>
<p>（六）農業金融需資浩大，非杯水車薪所能奏效。故尤非集合之力量所能舉辦。</p>
<p>由於上述六點特質，可見辦理農金融之不易，非爲私人所能辦理之事業，實非國家倡導不爲功。是以世界主要各國，對於農業金融，均有特殊制度，或中國家主辦，或由政府補助，蓋其性質近於官營。以我國之情形，辦理農業金融，其困難當倍於他國，而需資之大，不難推想。據上述全國農戶五千八百五十六萬九千一百八十一戶中，假定半數農戶，必須借款，姑以每戶每年一百元計，已年需三十萬萬元之譜，殊非普通銀行所能勝任。故甚望國家銀行出而領導，負其重任，更出一般銀行，共同合作，則我國農業經濟之復興，庶有望乎。</p>
<h3>浙省糧管局　辦理米商存米登記</h3>
<p>杭州雖非產米之區，但杭郊之　墅，則素爲浙省米市之中心。事變以來，湖墅米市一落千丈，因此杭州食糧，亦時有不足現象。今年舊曆新年以來，杭州米價，突見高昂，黑市交易，殊爲流行，浙省糧食管理局為抑平米價，遂於上月二十六日起，發出布吿，限杭州全市之米店所有之存庫米穀，一律於本月五日以前，前往辦理登記手續，如過期隱匿不報者，決予嚴懲不貸云。</p>
<h3>華中火柴公司　組織完成</h3>
<p>大中華火柴公司自由日軍當局歸還我國後，即由中日兩國商人合營，資本我國商人方面佔有其六，日商佔有其四，並改名爲「華中火柴公司」，經中日雙方發起人積極籌備以來，各項工作，大致已吿就緒，，並擇定本埠，博物院路八十八號爲公司辦事地點。茲經探悉，該公司於日前舉行第三次發起人會議，對於公司內部組織機構。及各部門重要職員已有詳細決定，計推定筮事長陳伯藩，副董事長安野義一，常務董事劉念義，田口武夫，董事陳泮東，監察人朱旭昌，中村云田。至該公司中內部機構，計分秘書室，總務科。製造科，會計科，共一室三科，職員正式名單，大致爲中日參半云。</p>

<h3>金城銀行收歇　香港分行　業務集中上海</h3>
<p>金城銀行最近决定收歇香港分行，自本月一日起至十五日整理存款收支及其他業務，以便結束。今後港行之業務，完全集中於上海，蓋香港當局於最近將限制華方銀行支付存款等辦法取消，故趁此結束，俾能集中業務於上海總行。</p>

<h3>泰國經濟　統制進展</h3>
<p>最近泰國產業經濟界上，最堪重視者，卽爲各項統制之進展，及振興農業之方策，關於經濟統制一項，自大東亞戰爭勃發後，泰政府即頒佈各項統制法，然初未得充分之效果，故於二月中，復頒佈製紙及其他各項統制法，並對各重要產業，採取由政府經營之方針，又對前遭水災地區，因出貨延遲，致碾米業之業務不振一項，近將採取對策，至於輸出市塲依然以運輸爲重要問題，目下此問造船廠已開始建造木造巨型帆船，此舉實堪期待，泰國在供給大東亞共榮圈之糧食上素佔重要地位，目下則益趨重要，泰政府已設置『協同組合銀行』作爲全國農業組合之金融機關，並採取種種振興農業之方策，最近畢本首相，曾視察各地軍事狀况，歷一月之久，並曾視察泰北農村，當畢本首相返抵盤谷後，即召各農村村長至首都說明改良農務及振興農業之必要，泰農業部，亦根據畢本首相之意，特撥特別預算二百五十萬拔，茲以建設湄南河西部等十一處之水利工事，裨振農業，又泰政府復改變過去以米爲主之農業經營方針，即同時對大豆棉花菸葉蔬菜等，亦作大量栽培，據二月十日，泰農業部發表一九四〇年度大豆之收穫，爲十二萬四千六百担，較一九三九年增收二十一倍，又蔬菜類等之產量，較戰前增達數百萬担，現在不但已可不必從他處輸入，且有剩餘，泰國素爲農業國，今復振興農業，故對大東亞共榮圈之糧食，必有極大之貢獻。</p>

<h3>吸收剩餘購買力的檢討</h3>
<p>— 仁林</p>
<p>讀四日申報「吸收剩餘購買的芻議」的一文後，深感泛濫的游資，非採積極的强制性的吸收剩餘購買力的措置不可了。</p>
<p>由於游資的集中，沒有正當的出路，於是泛濫爲禍，促成社會上購買力的急速膨脹，尤其是剩餘購買力的擴張爲更速，剩餘購買力的擴張，因而促成投機的瘋在和囤積的居奇。</p>
<p>過去當局雖亦會採疏導游資，緊縮通貨，取締投機，限制銀錢業放款等措置，冀使購買力的縮小，游資的安定，但此僅是消極的措置，究不能深獲長久的效果。是以在游資的暫時安定後，不久，又另找新出路，促成新興事業的勃興，以爲投機囤積的延續。現今游資再度活動的結果，使剩餘購買力更爲膨脹，並刺激物價的步步上升，物資的逐漸减少，囤積的傾向，更爲顯著，人民生活的高壓因而達於極點。現今物價的激漲，物資的奇缺，雖云生產的銳减，交流的不圓滑，但剩餘購買力的作祟，我人是不可否認的。</p>
<p>由此可知，剩餘購買力的不能收縮，則物價亦終不會安定。然則於剩餘購買力的收縮，如若再採過去的以通貨政策爲抑制的消極措置，則其效微甚，不能持久，終歸失敗，自後自不應再走此道了。徒勞往返，於事無補，自應改弦更張，另換新策。而其新策，自爲更進一步的設法吸收剩餘購買力的一途了。所以作者對廣瀨庫太郞氏所主張的以商品庫券來吸收剩餘購買力，是絕對的贊同。</p>
<p>因爲現今的囤積居奇，促成物價之暴漲，黑市之橫生，使物資的配給發生阻礙，限價制度等於虛設，動搖　生的安定，妨礙物價政策的推進，莫此爲甚了。是以對此問題的解決，不容再緩的了。但此問題的解決，必須採積極的强制性的吸收手段了。</p>
<p>當今交戰各國，對於剩餘購買力吸收的措置，也都採取，不過　所採取的，是防之於未然的措置，如强册儲蓄等，以吸收社會的剩餘購買力，防止其膨脹，免爲戰時經濟之騷擾。但是現今的我國，剩餘購買力業已膨脹，所以今後的措置，非但要防止其再膨脹，而且尙要吸收已經膨脹的剩餘購買力，此須爲阻之於已然的措置，這是一點不同的地方，我人所官注意的。爲改正於已然，所以僅採强制儲蓄，已是不够，須進一步的採用以商品庫　來收買投機囤積者手中的商品，使剩餘購買力的被吸收，游資的固化，於是無法再爲作祟，囤積减少，配給圓滑，物價自能穩定，民生亦能安定。</p>
<p>目前的剩餘購買力，一部份固已變爲商品，而走入囤積居奇的途上，但尙有一部份仍浮動於市塲，試　近來銀行存款的激增，爲數亦不在小。對於此項待機而動的活存，亦不能再爲放任，當亦不能被擯於吸收之外。因爲此項浮動的活存，也都有隨時轉人投機囤積的可能。爲求剩餘購買力的澈底之吸收，投機囤積的根本之消滅，對此項浮動異常的活存，亦須設法予以吸收。如發行生產公債以吸收之類辦法。如是，游資旣　可减少，又能增强國家資本，以供建設之用，一舉兩得，亟宜速行，不可再爲忽視。</p>
<p>上述兩者，僅　業已膨脹的剩餘購買力之吸收。如若此項正在急速膨脹中的剩餘購買力完全吸收後，新的剩餘購買力的再產生，亦爲可能的常有之事，對此如不預爲防止，則豈非現存剩餘購買力的吸收，又將徒勞了。是以對於新的剩餘購買力的產生，亦宜以强制儲蓄等手段以阻止之。</p>
<p>上述三者，以商品庫券收買囤積的商品，以生產公債吸收浮動的活存，以及强制儲蓄，方式雖爲不同，由吸收剩餘購買力則爲一致的。因爲剩餘購買力的形式，不相一致，所以吸收的方法，亦不能相同。此三者必須兼採，且須同時施行，乃能收宏效。如若缺一，即將多生麻煩，徒起不必要的頓挫。</p>
<p>在此剩餘購買力吸收之際，亦須輔以通貨緊縮的措置，其效乃易顯見。是以此吸收購買力和通貨政策亦宜並行，於是通貨和物價的兩項對策，都能獲得成功。</p>
<p>現今游資的猖獗，剩餘購買力的作祟，巳受害不淺了。如再不求澈底的辦法，則游資變態的花樣不知將止於何底。因爲游資是好動的，如僅爲抑制，則變態花樣便會立即出現，以規避此項的抑制，而繼續其作祟的活動。是以時至今日，已非採積極的强制性之吸收剩餘孵買力的措置不可了。我人祈望當局改換新策，從速推進，力矯此不良的現　。上述的措置，如能立即實施，於國民經濟的發展，當亦不無小補。</p>

<h3>撤廢治外法權和課稅問題</h3>
<p>本月一日，南京日本大使館舉行過一個討論撤廢治外法權的會議，決定先從課稅方面付諸實施，這一點對於加强國府的財政上，有極重大的意義。英美所謂撤廢治外法權，僅不過一句空話，毫無實際，可是日本方面，具有誠意，所以先把國府方面所最盼切的部份實行。治外法權撤廢後的日僑和各國人民的課稅，是怎麽　的狀態呢？治外法權　廢後課稅，對於國府財政上，有　什麼作用呢？下而來作一個簡單槪觀吧！</p>
<p>國府財政的現狀</p>
<p>國民政府的財政，是極健全的，就像石波最高顧問上次在上海發表的談話一樣，去年度還有盈餘，參戰後的財政支出，必然增多，所以收人方面也不得不設法增加。現在國時的財政收入，以稅收占最多數，其中關稅·鹽稅·統稅等間接稅約百分之九十，直接稅數字械微，但財政部方面欲仿世界先進國之成例，增强直接稅之稅收而鞏固財政之基礎，還都以來，爲　此點，煞費苦心，財政部長周佛海氏本年初也曾發表過意見說：「國府財政的重心，今後必須由間接稅移到直接稅」夷考這種辦法，遠在淸代就有，當初淸廷決定創設直接稅制度，但是沒有實行。後來民國二十四年開始征收，可是毫無收入，到了民國二十六年才有一些，總數約三千五百萬元，不過占全部收入百分之二左右。關於這一點，現在國府正極力設法增收，將來必然有良好的成績。</p>
<p>治外法權撤廢後的課稅負担</p>
<p>在治外法權沒有撤廢之前，日僑和各國人民都不回國府繳納直接稅，但治外法權撤發之後，當然有繳納的義務，間接稅方面，沒有什麽重大的變化，僅直接稅有相當變動，直接稅的徵收率和方法如何，現在止由中日雙方專門委員會分別協議之中，還沒有具體決正，但衆認中日兩國政府的方針，一定力求弗　發生重大變遷，這一點是可充分信賴當局的。這次治外法權的撤廢，是爲　實現建設東亞新秩序的崇高理想　實行的，中日兩國人民，應該充分明　而積極協助政府，使它可以達到目的，治外法權撤廢之後，國府的稅收縱然不能立刻增加，可是在政治上却有極大的意義，直接間接都有利益。一方面中國民衆應該改變過去的態度，要加强本國政府的財力而放棄目前小利，必須積極協助繳納賦稅，任何國家的直接稅，總是　國民　助的，假使沒有國民協助，斷然不會成功。</p>
<p>現在　稅　機構</p>
<p>現在國府的稅收機構，在財政部之下計有　務署，稅務著，鹽務署，所得稅處，廣東財政特派員　署，湘鄂贛臨時財政整理委員會五大稅收機構，另外在厦門也有組織。</p>
<p>增加稅收，不是單靠提高稅率，必須要養成廉潔的稅收官吏，充實它的機構，振興　業，這才可以增加負担稅賦的力量，這種辦法都有希望逐步實施，調整中央和地方的運用連繫也是必要的，現在國民政府在這一點上，已經比從前進步得多了，但是還在不斷水進步，道是値得　意的。在淸代因爲用極端的地方分權財政機稱，所以淸廷能够直接　配的不過關稅和鹽稅一部份，回想到上面這種情形，那末比了國府適當合理措置，眞有隔世之感</p>
<p>殘餘的課題</p>
<p>國府財政上今後所殘餘的課題為發　公債及創設專賣制度，關於公債，財長周佛海氏會聲明暫時將不　發　，石渡最高　濟顧問也曾說在本年上半期中沒有發　公債的必要。在戰時狀態下，任何國家都發行公債，因爲發　公債在防止通貨膨脹，抑制物價，利用遊資等財政經濟政策上，極爲有效。發行公債後事實上曾收獲了很大的效果，所以成爲國民政府今後的課題。</p>
<p>專賣制度，從中國的社會組織，民間　况上推測起來，是否立刻能够成功，尙不可知。但中國有識人士之間，會研究日本的專賣制度，很想在中國採用。然而那幾種商品應有專賣，那是很可注意硏究的問題。（任雲鵬譯自三月四日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>「只重衣衫不重人」</h3>
<p>— 謝謝山</p>
<p>有人說：「凡是衣服華麗的，便是上等人；否則便是瘪三。」也有人說：「我們自己雖不以衣服爲重，但是社會太勢利了，所以我們也不能不看重衣服，否則便是遭人輕視了。」</p>
<p>假使這兩種論調是對的，那麽人類生下來並不爲了做人，只是做個衣架子罷了！倘有不願做衣架子的，便不會「只重衣衫」了！</p>
<p>只有胸無所有，不知是非，醉生夢死的，纔會喊出一只重衣衫不重人」。也只有不能自主，隨聲附和，把自己看成渺乎其小的，纔會說：「社會如此，我們也不得不如此。」</p>
<p>武訓，他是個乞丐，他的衣服是襤褸的，但是他興學的偉大精神，便把全世界的珍寳聚在一起，也不能和他相比。難敢「只重衣衫」而輕視他呢？</p>
<p>「衣敝縕袍與衣胡貉者立而不恥者」，才能「中立而不倚，强哉矯！」</p>
<h3>回憶的作用</h3>
<p>— 李思遂</p>
<p>回憶是最美麗的，最令人神往的。</p>
<p>生活遭遇嚴重打擊，失却面對現實的勇氣時，人們總喜歡追溯以往，沉湎在回憶的大海中，麻痺自己。藉自欺的安慰，來迵當前的困難和抑制已發生的苦悶。</p>
<p>人們的回憶多半楚過去愉快生活的片段，很少會想及以往的艱苦。這也是逃避現實，企圖把自己關在象牙塔中的表示。正如想把時間開倒車，和想抓着自己頭髮要使自己昇高，顯然同是自欺的幻夢。然而爲甚麼有這許多願做幻夢的奴隸呢？</p>
<p>過去的當時能針對困難，解決苦悶，不折不撓頑强地生活下來，今天至少不會有悲觀失望的情緒；遇着困難和苦悶，也不想作逃避的念頭。那麽，今天的生活，何嘗不就是將來的過去呢！難道我們希望將來的生活更煩惱嗎？嚴格說來，這是精神自殺的一種方式。它會使我們產生所謂看破紅塵，苟且偷安的消極人生觀。</p>
<p>其實失望，消極不一定就是回憶的獨生子：相反的，它能成爲增强自信的因素，如果我們能從以往的成敗中體騐出經騐和敎訓，和肯在當前生活鬥爭中，給以融會貫通地運用的話。經騐和敎訓的獲得，決不能憑單純事實結果的直覺的了解。而是需要追溯當時對困難是作何估計，和當時的對策，執行過程的緊韌性，因而產生怎樣的結果。都加以分析綜合，反覆地硏究，使我們得出結論，了解這次得失的原因和敎訓。再把它加以運用在下次生活鬥爭中。唯有不斷的攝出和運用經騐和敎訓，方才是眞實的，而不是學究式的！</p>
<p>許多人未嘗不知道這一套然而在實際生活中，非但不善於運用回憶，而且反被它所奴役。偶爾會作煥發的嘗試，但經不起一而再，再而三的打擊後，便回復以前的消和任意的態度；或者也不過成爲單純直覺的經騐主義者，這種人是不是宿命地過去的奴隸呢？不，問題是在他們對自己前途有否有個積極的人生目標。如果他們能看重自己的將來，期望自己的目標能早日完遂，他們自然對時間的利用會極　人事。回憶的作用就重要了！</p>
<h3>再談朋友問題</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>前天爲紀念三三友朋節，曾在本報發表一篇，朋友上的幾個問題」，但意猶未盡，所以又想到兩個實際問題：</p>
<p>（一）老少無期</p>
<p>「老我老以及人之老，幼我幼以及人之幼」，這是人類偉大的仁愛精神。講到朋友，應該無分老少，不過由於年齡相差，習慣思想等等的不同，好傑有「話不投機半句多」的形勢，甚至於相互歧視的態度。其實，這造大可小必的，因爲老年自從少年而長，少年也有到老年的時候，那末如果大家胸襟放得大些，在友道的精神上，有什麼不可調和的　方？老年朋友的經騐閱歷比較豐富，少年朋友要以公正判斷的胸懷，接受老年朋友的良好的見解，如果一槪抹煞，不但有失敬老」的美穗，而且不擇善言，於自己立身處世方面是蒙害不淺的。至於在老年朋友方面，也不要倚老賣老」，以爲「後生小子何足道哉」，要知道用這種態度對待少年朋友，反而要被人輕視，使人不敢親近的。我以爲最要緊的是：少年朋友能够在老年朋友方面多認識寳貴的經騐，多接受善意的指導，同時老年朋友對於有誠意的少年朋友，不妨用愛護的精神，視爲子弟一樣，循循善誘，以期「靑出於藍」。因此，少年朋友要「敬老」，老年朋友要做出好的榜樣。</p>
<p>（二）銀錢關係</p>
<p>君子有成人之美，朋友有通財之義。錢本身是流通的東西，由於「人爲」的關係，可以起許多作用，情誼莫逆的朋友，爲了銀錢關係，以致友誼破裂的很多。這大槪起因於往來不淸的成份居多，而因爲錢的關係以致有勢利的觀念與有勢利的行爲，實是朋友中極不好的情形。我認爲銀錢不妨相通，但手續不可不淸，這是信用攸關，因爲信用一破產，朋友方面就都不敢相信，而以後也休想朋友幫忙了。另一方面，如果僅僅把錢看得太重，而不顧情義，實在也非朋友之道，大家不可以錢的關係而結合友誼，也不可以錢的關係而斷絕友誼。</p>
<h3>自信力</h3>
<p>— 文釗</p>
<p>當您在窮困沮喪時，當您在潦倒失意時，亦許您會對自己感到失望，感到自己的渺小。可是倘使您還是個有靈性的人，您應該趕快堅强您的自信力——祇有信任自己，才是唯一能挽救您窮困潦倒的方法！</p>
<p>拿造房子的地脚來譬喻自信力，亦許是最確切的：您可會看見過泥水匠造房子？在開治砌牆之前，他們必須先在地下打成堅固的地脚，打得愈深，房子亦可造得愈高。假使您要使您以後的事業像屋子一樣愈造愈高，您就先得在心裏打下一條堅而深的地脚，緊決地信任您自己。</p>
<p>一個優越的匠人在打地脚的時候亦必須考慮到環境，他知道一道歪曲不整的地脚將會使未來的房屋失央美親和堅固，他亦知道假使地脚的界限侵佔到他人的田地中時，造起的房屋會使他人遭受損害；當然，倘若您自信您可以成爲一個强盜頭目，這種自信力亦決不能使您將來的房堅固穩妥的。</p>
<p>光有了地脚，若小加工砌牆，屋子亦决不會有落成的一天：或者已有了地脚，爲了要使摩天大厦早日落成，不屑刻意砌磚，以致對牆壁偷工减料，試想在這樣粗製濫造下完成工作焉得不蹈魯莽滅裂之轍！在自信的基礎上，您還得一步步小心做去，每做到一步就好比多砌了一塊磚頭，可以使牆壁加高，亦可以使地脚更加堅固。</p>
<p>沒有準確而堅强的自信力，沒有刻苦不懈的奮鬥力，決不會成就任何偉大的事業，正好像在一片荒凉的空地上，不打下地脚，永遠是一片荒凉的空地，日後決不會矗立起一幢高大的屋子。</p>
<p>不要再徘徊於您眼前荒凉的空地上豔羨他人的高樓大厦了！亦不要再以爲荒凉的空地上不可能造出高樓了！要您自己晚離眼前窮困潦倒的境地，趕快及早堅定您的自信力努力去奮鬥，打定您的地脚去加工造屋。在人生道上誰能一點不遇到挫折？你現在的窮困潦倒難免不是爲了您以前不信任您自己所致。早一天堅定您的自信力，就可早一天解除您目前的厄遇，亦可早一天完成您的高樓大厦來容納自己和他人安居了。</p>
<h3>賺錢與用錢</h3>
<p>— 歐陽棫</p>
<p>人，一天不能不生活，便一天不能離開錢。尤其是在這資本主義色彩極端濃厚的上海，人和錢的關係，更見密切。所謂「一錢逼死英雄漢，」眞是人情努利的上海社侖的寫眞。</p>
<p>我有時間着在想，假使把這幾百萬市民，從錢的關係上區別起來，不外有四種人：第一種人是少賺少用，他們都是安分的低薪階級，因爲都是流着汗血才得到少量的錢，所以大多能克勤克儉，十分節省。第二種人是多賺少用，他們大多是勤儉出身的小資產階級，靠了時機，物價一漲再漲，水漲船高，他們的資產也日多一日，而對於用錢是十分吝嗇，十足是些守財奴，拔一毛而利天下不爲也。第三種人是少賺多用，大多是些紈褲子弟，不知物力維艱，一味的浪用，結果，入不敷出，一切奸詐竊盜的事都要做出來了。這種人，是社會安寗的破壞者，和吸血的惟利自圖的商人，同樣是市民的公敵。第四種人是多賺多用，這種人大多是巨腹賈或有特殊權勢者，他們賺錢容易，自然用錢也隨便，一擲千金，毫無吝嗇，他們是聲色塲中的闊客。所謂悖入者亦悖出。</p>
<p>至於用錢的價値，並不在錢的數量多寡，而在於用途的正當與否？在此大東亞戰爭時期，更應審塡，像救濟難胞，養老恤貧，捐資助學等，都是用錢的大道。化小我的觀念爲大我，蠲享樂的心理爲吃苦。不當用時，雖一文亦不用，當用時即鉅萬亦不吝，這才是錢的主人。否則，去做錢的奴隸，又何苦呢？</p>

<p>自己已是三十以外的人了，在人生旅途上，已無意嬉笑良謔的愛玩，也不想亂哄哄地一味凑熱鬧；何况我的個性原有些板實。我總覺得一個人一到了中年，猶如在雨中疾走，再不能回復到少年時代春季旅行的興趣，這也是莫可奈何的心境。去年以來，更覺凄苦，因兄死弟亡，所加於我的創痛，眞如割如裂！我自己竟得好像執傘而行，更加大了我的暗影！自顧單影，不勝凄然！念親故之倐離，人生之寂寞，眞不知怎樣才能燃起熱情。爲的哥哥身後的蕭條，我曾爲之奔走乞賻，總算不虛此願，在這個人間，我還尋得些熱情，我雖在極度哀痛中，但得此熱情，正如見着光明，不禁奮然感念之至！故舊中如邱庭芳兄，史達晴弟都表示着深切的同情，彌覺可感！近讀邵西樵所編師友尺牘偶存卷上有王西莊札七通，其末一篇有一節云：「因竊思之，人生少年時初出來涉世交友，視朋友不甚愛惜也。及至足跡半天下，回想舊朋友實覺其味深長：蓋升沉顯晦，聚散離合，轉盼間恍如隔世，於極空極幻之中，七零八落，偶然剩幾個舊朋友在世，此舊物也，能不想煞！況此舊友實比新友之情深十倍耶？」這幾句話，我學得頗有意味，極能道出飽經世故的中年以後的心境，確有「少年不識愁滋味」，「而今識得愁滋味，」的意味。這個愁字正好解釋爲人世的艱難，越識得人世的艱難，越覺得友情之可貴。友情的基礎應建築在息難之上。世間的酒肉朋友，同樂不同難，因爲他們的基礎是築在浮沙之上，記得某一作家說：「我想五倫中，以朋友之義爲最高。」確實至理名言。因爲其餘的倫常關　多是以名分，以利害，少以情義來維繫。惟有朋友之義却純然是靈性的。所以世間常有家庭間的料紛，却少有道義之交的背叛。假使能將父子夫妻之間也參以友情之義，那末就會少有反臉逆倫的事了。所以友情不僅是最可尊貴的，而且也是最廣大的緣。推而至於政治上經濟上以及國際上，若能處處以誠樸的友情相感召，這個世間就不會如目前的滿目凌凉了！</p>
<p>我自去年以來，因兄死弟亡，旣極痛傷，然念我之周圍，尙有友情可覓取；那末只要密切連繫已有的友情，擴大新的友誼，也是補償心的缺憾的最好方法。在奮然感念中，爰書此以寄托我的哀思！</p>
<h3>迎頭趕上</h3>
<p>— 岳浩</p>
<p>學習的方式，顯然跟着環境和目標而　變，在科舉時代，爲了要博得一個舉人進士，誰能逃過經書子集，八股駢文的門限，十年窗下，還不是强記，背誦，模擬，試作，把整個的光陰，消磨在蛙書堆裏，等你一班成名，偶有著書論說，可是總逃不出舊套翻新的把戲，斤斤較量於一字一義之解釋，一宗一派之攻訐，對於整個社會方式的改進，科學文明的運用，却獨付闕如。外面的世界，儘管已改換一個面目，可是我們却依然　守成法，把三四千年前古老的文化，作爲現在生活的規範，以致吟嘯風月，文人雅士多如過江之鯽，高談闊論，到處是運籌帷幄決策千里的雄才大略家，把浮雲似的空虛幻想，寄以無限的信念，庚子拳匪之亂，一紙符咒可退十萬大軍的烈性炸彈，能不引爲千古話柄，空前奇恥！</p>
<p>時代像一個巨大的火輪，不絕的前進，不絕　吐着奇異光輝，一向認爲神秘的宇宙，已給人發掘了他的秘藏，引爲我用，偉大的自然，已失去了他全面的支配，憑我們的聰明，毅力，奮鬥，探索，已把他部份的肢解，天文，物理，化學，生物，地質等種種高深的硏究和發現，十九世紀後，已完全變了另一個世界，他已不僅建築在精神文明之上，更配合着物質的文明，牛頓的運動定律，僅是一個開始，瓦特的蒸氣機，達爾文的優生論，把一個靜穆純美術化的世界，已變成了一個激動競爭的舞臺。晚近放射體的發現，量子學說，波動學說的相繼創立，一個往昔認爲至偉至大的玄虛，已逐漸的給人揭露，當然這僅不過是一個最小的試探，全面的暴露，還有着一個相當的距離，但是這樣的一個轉變，已不是我們古舊的文化所能全部適應，我們已走上了火山的邊緣，假使你得不能把握自己，認識自己，就會給他融化，那裏決不容你逍遙自在，好整以暇，只有一個不進則退的判決，雖然這對於生活價値，是否合理，上物質文明帶給你的是痛苦還是快樂—還待後論，但是時代的急變，已不容你狐疑，我們得轉換一個目標，大膽的公開的儘量吸收人家的文化，不再侷促於我們一個很小的園地，這不是卑視我們自己的古有文明，不過是要有一個改變，一些充實，使他更能發揚光大，在新的潮流裏，不是毀滅，而是重生，現在萬臨到了生和死的關頭，進步和退化的邊緣，假如不甘落後，就得把學習的方式，來一個整個的調整，脚踏實地的苦幹，而不是斯斯文文的敷衍，實踐的而不是純理論的，針對着時代，迎頭趕上！</p>

<p>「對你們說不要吃火腿燉蛋，你們偏要吃火腿燉蛋！」一個十歲左右的男童聲音，帶着勃勃的怒氣，跟在砰的一聲之後，也傳了過來，使人聽了，覺得很調和，正像一個焦雷之後，立刻一陣大雨。「你們這些猪玀！賊骨頭！婊子！……」</p>
<p>『唉，眞正沒有辦法。』黃崇庵聽了一會，在炕床上搖着頭，連忙又取起炕几上的水烟袋來裝烟，聊以自解。</p>
<p>『崇翁不要動氣，』對面的揚子傑嘻開了鬍子嘴，親切地勸慰着『世兄還小呢，大了怕不…』</p>
<p>根明和兪篤周都瞪出了睛睛聽着，雖然他們都不是第一次聽見，但現在父聽着，總覺得有些異樣之感。</p>
<p>『小鬼一天到晚發脾氣。三姑爺回頭一笑，一顆金牙齒在保險燈的亮光中閃了一下，映着他那白得異乎尋常的面皮，不免使兪篤周的心裏，記起了「翩翩美少年」這句話。</p>
<p>「孩子，天實在冷，買不到活鯽魚…」一個老年婦人在用慈愛而和平的口吻勸說着。</p>
<p>『我不管！我不管！…』吼聲不絕。</p>
<p>『錢媽爲甚麽不想想法子呢？我們的地方就天天有活鯽魚。』一個中年婦人在隨着說。</p>
<p>『大小姐的地方旣然有，爲甚麽不帶幾條來呢！』錢媽冷酷的聲音。</p>
<p>『你又沒有託我，誰知道！你就是託了我，我應該爲你當差嗎！』含怒的反斥。</p>
<p>『那還不是等於白說！』不服。『錢媽，你……』</p>
<p>她們口角下去。</p>
<p>『嘔，嘔，我不要吃，我不要吃！…』哭聲來了。</p>
<p>哭聲，口角聲，勸聲，由對面的屋子裏，度過一個小小的天井，淸淸楚楚地送入了書房裏，到後來愈加緊張。書房裏的人，要不聽當然不能够，要自己談話，更其不能够。（四）</p>
<h3>除「苦」尋「樂」的方法（下）</h3>
<p>— 醉石</p>
<p>某大學聚餐會座談紀錄</p>
<p>「工作和義務應向上比，享受和權利應向下比」，是解除比較的痛苦」和產生「比較的快樂」的方法。我們對於自己的工作，和應盡的義務應和較我們繁重的人比，和較現在繁重的時候比。例如往往有人一天工作十小時，見到別入每天祗工作六小時，而酬報反多，常叫苦連天地喊着：「我的工作時間太長呀！酬報太薄呀」！假定他肯轉移目光，看看工人們每天工作十二小時以上，甚至十六小時，收入還不堪供其本人的溫飽，必會慶幸自已的工作時間還算短哩！酬報還算厚哩！</p>
<p>『我們對於自己的享受和應享的權利，應和較我們菲薄的人比，和較現在菲薄的時候比。譬如我們現在的衣食住方面，和以前比較起來，即感覺不舒服，感覺痛苦，假定我們常常回憶過去逃難時候，所經歷的那種難於形容的苦景，當會感覺現在的生活，尙算安定，並不覺苦。</p>
<p>「總之我們「遭遇」的本身，無所謂痛苦和快樂，牠固能使人感到痛苦，亦能使人感到快樂，這全視我們怎樣的想法。對於同一的遭遇，這樣去想會覺得痛苦，那樣去想，會感覺得快樂，我們祇要以足以產生快樂的想法，去想我們的「遭遇」，自然會快樂了。</p>
<p>「多樹立可能實現的希望，多爲已樹立的希望而努力』，是解除「失望的痛苦」和產生「希望的快樂」的方法，我們在人生旅途中，如不多多樹立「希望」那末成爲「前途無望」自少樂趣可言。可是我們樹立的希望，應有實現的可能，否則，那不是一種「希望」，僅是一種永不能實現的「妄想」。有了可能實現的希望，還得要自己不斷地努力，使「希望」現之期，一天一天地接近，如此，快樂才能與日俱增。假如有了希望而不努力，結果，還不免要失望而感覺痛苦，即便成功，亦屬僥倖。要說明這種牽連關係，最適當的例子，莫如义馬將了。我們又馬將的時候，有可能實現的，連續的「希望」，加以不斷的「努力」，希望會不斷的實現。當我們起一副牌的當兒，我們已有一個想「和」的希望，於是將不要的牌「打」去，要的牌「摸」來，「吃」來，和「碰」來，這「打」「摸」「吃」和「碰」的動作，就是「努力」，使「和」的希望，漸漸地接近實現，倘結果被人家「和」去，本該「失望」，可是因第二副牌又起了，希望又來了，雖「失望」，但未「絕望」，故不覺痛苦，於是再「努力」，結果「和」，那時多多愉快呀！如此循環交替不已，能使又馬將的人們浸潤在快樂的氣氛中，無怪乎大多數人歡喜又馬將了。我們平日在空閒的時候，常會覺得生活太平凡，毫無生趣，這種感覺，是我們人缺乏可能實現的希望的反映；假使我們碰到這種情形，快動動腦經，速設法樹立多種可能實現的希望，再以全力去實現我們已樹立的希望，我敢保證，在「努力」的過程中，有無限的快樂，可給我們享　的」！</p>

<h3>Economic Mobilization and Civilian Organizations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion emphasized the importance of achieving total national economic mobilization after entering the war, and the necessity of establishing civilian organizations to assist the government in propaganda, explanation, guidance, promotion, and evaluation work in order to achieve economic mobilization. However, how should such organizations be structured and how should they carry out specific work to cooperate and coordinate with the government for satisfactory results?</p>
<p>The role of civilian organizations in promoting national economic mobilization lies in assisting the government in implementing wartime economic policy guidelines, advancing national economic mobilization efforts, and assisting the government in controlling prices, requisitioning, transportation, and consolidating the national economic foundation. Its main tasks are: (1) assisting in stabilizing prices, freight rates, and wages; (2) researching the implementation of stabilizing prices, freight rates, and wages, and suggesting improvements; (3) promoting and publicizing increased production and reduced consumption; (4) promoting general wartime living; (5) assisting in public debt savings and the requisitioning of materials; (6) assisting in increasing tax revenue, reforming malpractices, facilitating transportation, and implementing grain policies; (7) assisting in the mobilization of civilian manpower and all labor forces; (8) assisting in promoting wartime corvée labor and advocating for labor service; (9) assisting in prohibiting smuggling and cracking down on wartime profiteering; (10) investigating and evaluating the implementation of wartime economic policy guidelines and other economic laws and regulations; (11) investigating all fraudulent activities in the implementation of wartime policies and laws, to assist the government as its eyes and ears; (12) other matters concerning wartime economic policies and laws specifically entrusted by the government.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, the government can select fair-minded individuals, industrialists, financiers, and experts in economics, politics, and culture from the civilian population to be members of this civilian organization. From among them, several individuals should be publicly elected as standing committee members to establish a central organization. Furthermore, the country should be divided into several economic mobilization regions, and regional civilian organizations should be established. Social leaders should be selected from each province, city, and county to be members of local organizations. Each member must, under the leadership and direction of the organization, undertake one or more of the aforementioned tasks, determine their own roles, and carry out their work at their place of residence or service. General meetings and regional meetings should be convened at specific times and when necessary. The standing committee members are responsible for maintaining close contact and cooperation with relevant government agencies responsible for promoting economic policies and laws at all levels. For the sake of effective work, investigation teams, research groups, and propaganda teams may be organized to carry out the work. In order to effectively promote mobilization work, relevant agency personnel, community leaders, and local gentry may be consulted when necessary, or symposiums may be held to gather opinions and suggestions for improvement regarding controls and mobilization, and these opinions and suggestions may be submitted to the competent authorities for consideration. Furthermore, responsible accusations from the public or community organizations regarding malpractices by control and mobilization agencies may be accepted, investigated, and forwarded to governments at all levels or relevant competent authorities for handling, depending on the severity of the circumstances. It is also possible to separately convene meetings with factories, commercial firms, transportation companies, and agricultural, industrial, and commercial associations to listen to their reports and opinions on controls and mobilization, and provide them to the government and competent authorities for reference. On the one hand, it is important to cooperate closely with fair-minded local individuals, and on the other hand, it is essential to establish contact with the government and competent authorities, while always maintaining a detached position, so as to be able to advise the government at any time, eliminate all barriers and misunderstandings between the government and the people, and enhance the effectiveness of wartime economic policies.</p>
<p>The thorough implementation of wartime economic policies depends on the full assistance of the people. The civilian organization that we envision must be established as soon as possible. We hope that the wise authorities will not neglect this important suggestion.</p>
<p>Commentary and Translation</p>
<h3>Japan's New Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Due to the National Government's entry into the war, Japan's policy toward China has undergone an epoch-making transformation. In order to enable China to complete its autonomy and independence, strengthen the political power of the National Government, and unite China and Japan as one to advance toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has abolished extraterritoriality and returned concessions. Furthermore, Japan will provide strong support in political and economic aspects. Regarding the direction of this new Japanese policy toward China, Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister, revealed the government's views at the meeting of the North China Development Company Committee of the House of Representatives on the 24th. (See the Third Japanese Report for details). Currently, both China and foreign countries are deeply concerned about this issue. This explanation has achieved great results in order to enable the general public to fully understand and to make the Chinese people rely on Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's fundamental policy toward China lies in respecting China's autonomy and independence and enabling the National Government to fully exert its political power. There is no need to elaborate on this point. In particular, Japan's desire for the completion of China's autonomy and independence has been a consistent policy since the Konoe Statement. One of the main goals of the Chinese national movement in recent years has been to complete China's autonomy and independence and break away from its semi-colonial status of the past century. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang firmly believed that China's autonomy and independence and the liberation of East Asia could only be achieved in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, he decided to share weal and woe with Japan and cooperate fully. Subsequently, he resolutely announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, to live and die with Japan, and to advance toward defeating Britain and the United States. In this way, China's autonomy and independence and the closer cooperation between China and Japan are advancing simultaneously, finally promoting their realization.</p>
<p>In the future, the relationship between China and Japan must respect each other's position. Regarding this point, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia explained in the Diet that the National Government, in order to express its cooperation with Japan, will automatically exert various administrative measures under its own conscious responsibility and creativity. As for Japan, it strictly prohibits interfering with its administration. It fully explains how fair Japan's policy toward China and its attitude toward the National Government are. In the face of this obvious fact, any malicious propaganda is worthless.</p>
<p>Thinking for China and planning for China, Japan's sincerity must permeate the impression of the Chinese people. When Japan demonstrates its policy toward China to the Chinese people with facts, it will be the day when the Chongqing regime's basis for resistance is denied by all the people.

<h3>Preparing to Implement the Return of Concessions: Chinese and Japanese Committee Members Conferred Yesterday; Discussing a Plan for Returning Exclusive Concessions; The Result of the Negotiations Between the Two Sides Was Extremely Satisfactory</h3>

After Ambassador Shigemitsu introduced the Japanese committee members and Minister Chu introduced the Chinese committee members, they proceeded to discuss concrete plans for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) In accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the agreement concluded between China and Japan regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the committee members appointed to return exclusive concessions and the specialized committee members for the abolition of extraterritoriality gathered at the Ningyuan Building conference room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 4th) to hold the first committee meeting.

At 11:00 AM sharp, the first meeting of these epoch-making committees for the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality was solemnly held in the beautifully scenic Ningyuan Building. The atmosphere at the meeting was exceptionally solemn. Ambassador Shigemitsu and Foreign Minister Chu successively introduced the attending committee members from both sides. Ambassador Shigemitsu then delivered a speech, stating the importance of the Japanese side's implementation of the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Chairman Chu then gave a reply. Both sides spoke sincerely. Subsequently, they proceeded to discuss concrete plans for the return of Japanese exclusive concessions. The result of the negotiations was extremely satisfactory. The meeting adjourned at noon. Chairman Chu hosted a banquet to entertain all the committee members and attendants. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the atmosphere was lively and cheerful. The hosts and guests were in high spirits until the banquet ended at 3:00 PM. (Further News) Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 PM on the 4th to entertain all the Chinese and Japanese committee members and attendants of the two specialized committees for the return of exclusive concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, in order to express friendship.</p>
<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Ambassador Shigemitsu delivered a speech at the meeting of the Chinese and Japanese committee members to discuss the return of concessions:</p>
<p>For the purpose of discussing and deciding on the details regarding the implementation of the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, China and Japan each appointed their committee members in late January. Today, I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you here and to introduce our committee members to the Chinese committee members.</p>
<p>It is well known that this committee was appointed in accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the agreement between the Republic of China and Japan, concluded on January 9 of this year, regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. This committee is entrusted with the task of implementing the long-cherished hope of the Republic of China, namely the important undertaking of implementing the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The gathering of the Chinese and Japanese committee members today can be said to be the first step in realizing this important undertaking.</p>
<p>China and Japan have firmly pledged to cooperate closely with each other to complete the common war, realize the great task of restoring and building East Asia, and establish the foundation of world peace. The committee members of China and Japan, who have established a common front in this sacred war, have gathered together to promote the spirit of cooperation and friendship. I believe that this is a very meaningful thing.</p>
<p>China's long-cherished hope is now beginning to be realized. This is the result of the efforts of the Chinese side. Japan is sincerely pleased to contribute its assistance to the first step in fulfilling the aforementioned hope. As the tasks of the two countries' committee members have been described, I hope that this task will be completed successfully as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Reply</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Chairman Chu replied at the meeting of the two countries' committee members: According to the agreement signed on January 9th of this year between China and Japan regarding the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, each country has appointed committee members to discuss and decide on the details of its implementation. I am deeply pleased that the committee members from both sides have gathered here today for the first consultation.</p>
<p>The return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality are necessary conditions for completing China's independence and autonomy. What our country has failed to accomplish after decades of effort and struggle is now possible thanks to your country's enthusiastic assistance. The first step in implementing this historically significant undertaking is something that every Chinese person feels deeply gratified about and cannot help but feel.</p>
<p>For the past three years, your country has continuously provided assistance to the National Government in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields, and strengthening the National Government has been the goal of your country's efforts toward China. This has enabled our country to pick up the pieces after a period of decline, strive for recovery, and share the enormous responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. I am deeply grateful for this. This time, your country has overcome all difficulties and is determined to implement the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, enabling China to realize its long-cherished dream that it has never forgotten, and creating one of the most glorious pages in the history of Sino-Japanese friendship. Since assuming office, His Excellency Ambassador Shigemitsu has been particularly enthusiastic in assisting the National Government. Your Excellency's valuable efforts have made a significant contribution to this important historical event.</p>
<p>I have long been firmly determined to work together with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War and build a new order in East Asia, and I vow to dedicate my full efforts to achieve this goal. This time, your country's government is cooperating with our country to complete the aforementioned major undertaking, which will further increase our country's confidence and strength. There is no doubt that China and Japan, advancing hand in hand with this spirit and determination, will achieve victory.</p>
<p>Although today's gathering is the first meeting of this committee, there are still many things that need to be discussed in the future. However, based on the friendly and enthusiastic spirit that both sides have shown in the past and at present, I am confident that the task of this committee will be completed satisfactorily at an early date.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After attending the first meeting of the Committee for the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritoriality on the morning of the 4th, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu met with the press corps and expressed his thoughts as follows: The Japanese government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Agreement concluded on January 9th, is actively preparing to implement the appointment of committee members. The first negotiation was held today. All of Japan's concessions are important locations, so it still holds the economic center. In the future, all of them will be transferred. It is also to cooperate with China in developing politics and economy. This is what the Chinese government and people have been eagerly waiting for. It can also be said that it is the most realistic move for Japan to revise the unequal treaties, so that there will be no concessions in its own sphere of influence. The existence of concessions is completely different from the empty statements issued by various countries. Regarding the return of concessions, the first step will be to start with the exclusive concessions. However, these locations are extremely important, so it is necessary to negotiate various procedures. This kind of negotiation will be carried out in the future. This matter is also to implement Japan's greatest policy, and there are of course realistic sacrifices in imagination, but in general, considering the future of China and Japan, I sincerely hope that the relationship between the two countries will develop day by day.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces in Wuhan Operating Smoothly; Express Goodwill for Cooperation With Our Army</h3>
<p>Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Sino-Japanese Army's spring offensive operation has yielded impressive results. The staff and officers of the Wuhan operational army stated that the Chinese army was exceptionally active in this operation and the local residents enthusiastically cooperated. They issued the following statement on the 3rd: "Since the start of this operation, in less than two weeks, two major operations have been launched. Of the eight divisions of the Chongqing army's resistance forces, five divisions have been annihilated, and the other three divisions have suffered significant damage. To annihilate the Chongqing Sixth War Zone's advancing army, a annihilation battle was launched against Wang Jinzai's army in coordination with the attacks from the Shashi and Nanchang areas, which gave the Chongqing side a great shock both materially and psychologically. From the start of the operation until the most recently determined results, the Chongqing army has abandoned approximately 7,650 bodies, approximately 18,500 have been captured, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition have been seized. The Chongqing Sixth War Zone has now suffered a fatal blow. The fact that the number of prisoners is two and a half times greater than the number of dead is also a characteristic of this operation. In this operation, the strategic base of Chongqing's Sixth War Zone was captured, and the Japanese side has secured a strategic position in that area, which is of great significance. Furthermore, the access routes for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Yangtze River waterway west of Yuezhou have been completely blockaded. Also, in this operation, the residents of this area actively cooperated with the Japanese army, directly and indirectly contributing significantly to the promotion of the operation. None of these residents fled. The atmosphere is full of cooperation everywhere, either gathering thousands of farmers to build roads, or guiding roads, and scouting military information. These events are enough to express the spirit of great unity of the East Asian nations in the decisive battle. The Japanese army ensures the expansion of the political circle of the National Government in this area, and future developments can be predicted.

Everyone is grateful."</p>
<h3>Factional Strife Repeatedly Arises Among U.S. Forces in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The disarray of the U.S. military command system and the lack of discipline of the U.S. military have long been noted by various parties. Recently, the U.S. magazine Times Weekly published an article discussing in detail the situation of power struggles within the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, which has greatly affected the war. A translation is provided below: An ugly scene of vying for power has been staged within the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, which has greatly affected operations. The main characters in the power struggle are Lieutenant General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force sent to Chongqing, and Lieutenant General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. Army sent to Chongqing and India. Because the air force personnel under Chennault had been active in the Yunnan war zone in the past five months, Stilwell disregarded this fact and said that "only the army can determine the victory or defeat of the war." Another reason is the infighting between Chennault and Lieutenant General Bissell, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force stationed in India. Most of the American Volunteer Group belonged to the Navy, so they were quite disgusted with Bissell, the army warlord. When the American Volunteer Group was disbanded and incorporated into the regular army, only five people remained in Chongqing, and the rest were withdrawn to their home country. Furthermore, Bissell recently sent personnel to Chongqing to investigate the internal situation of Chennault's troops. The report made by the special envoy contained many discrepancies with the facts, which caused dissatisfaction from the other side, and the rift between the two sides deepened. Furthermore, Chennault hopes to have 500 air force personnel, but his planes are all supplied by Bissell's Indian Air Force, and he feels very dissatisfied with his status being lower than Bissell. Even the U.S. Supreme Command is unclear about who should command the U.S. Air Force sent to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Economic Collapse in Chongqing; Lack of Supplies and Insufficient External Aid</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The "Toyo Keizai" weekly magazine recently published an article pointing out the situation of economic collapse in Chongqing, which is unusually detailed. The main points are recorded as follows: Due to the lack of materials and the failure of external aid, Chongqing has repeatedly requested the United States to strengthen aid, but all have been ignored. As a result, resentment towards the United States has become increasingly significant. Because China's coast is now tightly blockaded by the Japanese army, and the Burma Road is also in the hands of the Japanese army, it is impossible for the United States to assist Chongqing by sea. If they want to detour to the north, they are refused to pass because the Soviet Union insists on neutrality in the spirit of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty. Now they can only transport by plane through India, but the amount is very small. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all of Chongqing's blood transfusion routes have been cut off by the Japanese army one after another. Now Chongqing not only lacks weapons, but also gradually lacks general materials, and it is about to become more serious. Even if a small amount of foreign aid can be obtained from outside, it is nothing more than military supplies and weapons. The lack of production materials and daily consumer goods still cannot be solved. Therefore, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has made Chongqing even more isolated, and its wartime economic crisis has become increasingly serious. This is a epoch-making bad phenomenon for the economy in the remote southwest. In addition, Chongqing's excessive issuance of banknotes and the inability of funds from Shanghai and Nanjing to flow in have made the wartime economy of isolated Chongqing even worse. A New York Times correspondent in Chongqing said, "The deterioration of Chongqing's economic situation is even worse than the military failure." He also said, "If Chongqing collapses in the future, it will inevitably be caused by a total economic collapse caused by malignant inflation." Last year, Wilkie visited Chongqing as a special envoy of Roosevelt. He also said on October 7, "The military and financial and inflationary problems are the two major problems facing Chongqing. If inflation is not prevented as soon as possible, Chongqing will suffer significant damage." Today, Chongqing's price index is calculated based on the average price index of 100 in January to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China at the time of the incident, and it has been increasing day by day since then. From this, it can be seen that the situation of Chongqing's malignant inflation is very obvious, and Chongqing's economic collapse has become an unavoidable fact. Therefore, if the United States wants to continue to use Chongqing in the future, it must expand its material aid to Chongqing. However, when the aid route to Chongqing is completely cut off, no matter how the United States tries to increase weapons, even with the predetermined amount or the conclusion of a loan agreement, it will not be able to make up for the actual situation. Chongqing will eventually move towards economic collapse in isolation.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Severes Diplomatic Relations with France; Withdraws All Staff from the Embassy in Vichy</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Since the French government announced the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the Japanese army peacefully entered Guangzhou Bay based on the Japanese-Vietnamese agreement, Chongqing has felt uneasy and protested to the French government. It is now known that Chongqing convened a "Supreme National Defense Committee" to decide on its attitude towards France, discussed severing diplomatic relations with France, and passed the measure, which was handed over to the Chongqing "Foreign Affairs Department" for handling. According to Chongqing news the other day, all the staff of the Chongqing Embassy in Vichy have been withdrawn to Lisbon.</p>
<h3>Wang Jinzai's Chief of Staff Surrenders With 4,000 Troops</h3>
<p>Mouth, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base, the remnants of Wang Jinzai's army, led by Chief of Staff Li Dexin, had been severely attacked by the Japanese army since the 25th of last month. Later, due to the unbearable encirclement and fierce attack by the Japanese army, they led two regiments of their troops and fled west from Tonghaikou. When they arrived near Yujiafu, south of Bailu Lake, they attempted to make a final resistance, but they were pursued by the advancing Japanese army from the east. On the 28th, they were completely surrounded at Lijia Village. Finally, at 2:45 on the 2nd of this month, they led the 32nd Brigade Commander Wu Lanfu and 4,000 of their subordinates to surrender. Other remaining soldiers have also surrendered one after another. As of the 3rd, the Japanese army had captured a total of 25 mortars, 18 heavy machine guns, more than 60 light machine guns, and more than 120 rifles.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls Conference Continues to Meet</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Embassy in China has been actively proceeding with the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China.

It also continued to hold important discussions on the current issues in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Results on the Leizhou Peninsula</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army has been conducting mopping-up operations against the Chongqing forces in the Leizhou Peninsula and the Beijiang area for several days. As of February 20th, the summarized war results that have been ascertained are as follows: The Chongqing side suffered 399 bodies left behind, 245 captured, and the following were seized: 1,405 Chongqing army rifles, 13 machine guns, 312 pistols, 1,288 pistol bullets, 4 mortars, 128 hand grenades, and many other items.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Smashes Chongqing Army in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Qingdao, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army elite units, in order to eliminate the Chongqing army's first detachment hiding in central Shandong Province, began operations on February 26th. They completely surrounded 700 men of the Chongqing army's first detachment northwest of Yishui, and under the cooperation of Japanese air units, launched a fierce attack, completely crushing the Chongqing army. The war results obtained by the Japanese army in this battle are as follows: 271 Chongqing army bodies were abandoned, 50 were captured, and 121 Chongqing army rifles, 12 pistols, and other ammunition were seized in large quantities.</p>
<h3>General Minami Discusses Impressions of Inspecting Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telephone call from Taipei, Privy Councilor General Jiro Minami recently inspected Southeast Asia for approximately one month and has now completed his official duties and is returning to the country. In a statement released here, he stated, "What impressed me most during this inspection of various places in the South was that our country's war aims have been deeply understood by the indigenous people. According to past practice, after the outbreak of war, indigenous people in the occupied areas often take hostile actions towards the occupying forces during the transition period. However, this has not happened in the Greater East Asia War. All regions are actively promoting cultural governance work under the three major goals of eradicating Anglo-American thought, understanding Japanese thought, and promoting indigenous culture. The indigenous people are actively assisting in every way. Furthermore, the oil resources in the South are extremely abundant. The Jambi oil field alone has four locations, and the oil production there already exceeds the amount shipped to our country." It is reported that the General plans to return to Tokyo via Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Submarine Warfare Intensifies Daily, Britain Feels Serious Threat, Ship Losses Heavy, Replenishment Difficult, British Government Considering Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from London, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander explained the significance of submitting the naval budget to the House of Commons on the 3rd, stating, "The British and Dominion navies have experienced the greatest hardships in the past year. Since Japan's entry into the war, naval battles have been extremely fierce. Furthermore, maritime transport in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is constantly subjected to attacks by Axis submarines and air forces. Therefore, the British fleet, which has always been responsible for escorting maritime transport in the Atlantic, has had to travel far to other oceans. Moreover, due to repeated large-scale naval battles, the British fleet has suffered considerable damage."</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A London dispatch reports that First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday in the House of Commons the recent naval losses, which include: (1) A certain convoy lost two cruisers, ten destroyers, ten other warships, and many cargo ships en route to the Soviet Union. (2) When transporting supplies to Malta, three cruisers, two aircraft carriers, nine destroyers, and many merchant ships were lost. As for the submarine crisis, the Axis powers are now manufacturing them in large quantities, and their number is greater than what the Allied powers can destroy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday in the House of Commons that Britain now has a new type of escort vessel in service at sea, which is heavier and faster than flat warships.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command previously announced that German forces sank 545,000 tons of anti-Axis ships in February. Therefore, Britain is now gradually emphasizing the construction of fast ships to counter submarines. As the British Minister of Transport, Leahy, stated in the House of Lords on the 2nd, although the construction of fast ships requires one and a half times the labor and materials, the British government is determined to strive to build a large number of fast ships within the scope that does not hinder military production. Of the ocean-going ships currently under construction, one-third are high-speed ships. Furthermore, British Prime Minister Churchill also announced in the House of Commons on February 12th that the British government is currently working hard to build escort vessels to adapt to countermeasures against destructive warfare. In the United States, the House Naval Affairs Committee also passed a bill to build or modify one million tons of auxiliary ships, appropriating approximately one billion yuan. According to a dispatch from Washington, the recent "Times Weekly" expressed its views on the issue, stating that shipyards across the United States are deeply troubled by material shortages due to the implementation of large-scale shipbuilding programs, but have not made any efforts to build escort vessels, and the plans are very slow. To date, only a small number of destroyers have been built, but three transport ships often require one destroyer for protection. However, the current ratio of transport ships to destroyers is only fifteen to one. Even if escort vessels are built quickly, there will still be a shortage of materials. The responsibility for this shortage of escort vessels lies entirely with the negligence and miscalculations of the Navy Department authorities.</p>

<h3>Donets River Basin, German Counteroffensive Achieves Great Victory, Sloviansk Occupied, Soviet Tank Columns Fail to Break Through</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - The official announcement here last night stated that German forces launched a counteroffensive southeast of Kharkov and crossed the Donets River upstream and midstream on Tuesday. The two armies are engaged in fierce fighting in the Balakliya area, 100 miles southeast of Kharkov. Large Soviet tanks have repeatedly attempted to break through, but have failed.</p>
<p>The Führer's Headquarters, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - The German war report this afternoon stated that German forces occupied Sloviansk, southeast of Kharkov in the Donets region, and also encircled the Soviet tank column Third Army south of Kharkov. Several German marshals are now launching a large-scale offensive in the central Donets and upstream Donets River, with a front line of 250 kilometers. Fighting continued yesterday in the northwestern area of Kursk. The Soviet army also launched several waves of attacks on the German positions northwest of Orel, suffering heavy losses and retreating.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was revealed here today that after Sloviansk was occupied, German forces have now gained a foothold on a 250-kilometer-wide front on the Donets River. At the same time, the Soviet attempt to break through towards the Donets Basin and Ukraine has been contained. The intensity of the Soviet offensive in this area was the center of the 1942-1943 winter offensive. Now, due to the heavy rains and mud in the southern section of the eastern front, the Soviet army had to abandon its offensive before reaching its goal. Although the fighting in the southern section of the eastern front has been hindered by the weather, the German counteroffensive is progressing smoothly. The defensive battles northwest of Kursk are continuing. The Soviet offensive northwest of Orel was repelled by German forces yesterday, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was announced here today that Sloviansk, which was occupied by German forces, is located in the Donets River basin and was captured during the recent German counteroffensive in the central Donets and south of Kharkov. A large Soviet force trapped south of Kharkov failed to break through, and part of it has been annihilated. At the same time, the German encirclement is intensifying. Furthermore, German forces again repelled a local Soviet offensive yesterday at the Kupensk bridgehead and the Mius front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - As the situation on the eastern front has developed to this point, the Soviet army knows that it cannot hold the Donets and the areas south and northwest of Kharkov for long. Therefore, it now plans to break through to the northwest of Kursk in Novgorod in order to restore its strategic equilibrium. However, no success has been seen so far. The Soviet army's attempt to seize the German positions in Orel has been thwarted by the German counteroffensive. The enemy forces northwest of Kharkov are continuing to retreat, and German forces have been able to cut off their main force. Regarding the encirclement of Poltava, this news is no longer being issued by the Soviet side.</p>
<p>Erziv Turned into Ruins, German Withdrawal Tactics Clever</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the eastern front, the fighting in the central and northern sections of the eastern front has come to an end after the German withdrawal from Erziv on the 2nd. After the German withdrawal from the salient positions between Demiansk and Erziv, the defense line has been shortened and the defenses have been strengthened. The German military strategy will also improve in the future. The German withdrawal tactics this time were extremely clever. The German rearguard completely destroyed 5,000 houses and other defenses in the city on the evening of the 2nd, and after burning the bridges outside the city, they withdrew calmly.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The past 24 hours have seen extremely fierce fighting on the eastern front. The main developments are three: (1) The German army in the central sector has withdrawn from the city of Erziv. (2) The Red Army is advancing west towards the city of Kursk. (3) The German army in the southern sector continues to make progress in its counteroffensive in the Donets River basin. The details are summarized as follows: (1) In the southern sector, in the Caucasus region, the two sides are engaged in artillery battles near the city of Novorossiysk. There is also fierce fighting in the northern part of the Kupensk area. There have been no major developments along the Rostov-Taganrog line, but fighting continues along the Mius River line. In addition to continuing its counteroffensive in the area from Sloviansk to Voroshilovgrad, the German army is also busy eliminating some remaining Red Army units. (2) Berlin announced that some Red Army units west of Kharkov have been encircled. However, Moscow says that the troops under General Golikov have reached the Kharkov-Bryansk railway line and occupied the city of Rakov. The Red Army is advancing along this line, which is 25 miles long from the city of Rakov to the city of Dmitry L'gov. In general, the Red Army command is still using its usual strategy, choosing to attack the weakest point in the German line. As for whether the goal of the Red Army offensive is to attack the city of Konotop from both the north and south (located in the middle of Kursk and Kharkov), it is still difficult to say at this time. (3) The Red Army is intensifying its pressure on the Orel area. According to Moscow sources, it is reported that the town of Zhuotai Duofu, 20 miles south of the city (which has a railway line directly to Kursk), has been occupied. However, the German side claims that it has taken precautions in this area and has sent reinforcements to support it. (4) In the central sector, the city of Erziv was originally a salient point in the German line. Therefore, its withdrawal was expected. However, no one knew that the German side had retreated entirely in absolute secrecy. Therefore, the speed of its sudden abandonment was initially beyond what outsiders could estimate. The German side claims that this move greatly surprised the Red Army. This is evidenced by the fact that the Red Army did not enter the city until two hours after the German side retreated. However, the Soviet side says that it occupied the city after a fierce battle and seized a large number of spoils of war. In any case, the Red Army has never mentioned the city of Erziv in recent war reports, indicating that the fighting there was very short. In addition, the troops under General Timoshenko are still intensifying their pressure in the Rovet River area.</p>
<p>German Stormtrooper Commander General Eicke Killed in Action</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - It was announced yesterday that Stormtrooper General Eicke was killed in action while commanding a tank division on the eastern front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - General Eicke, the commander of the German armored forces who died on the eastern front, was 51 years old and was from Alsace. In 1919, he was promoted to general of the Storm Guard. In 1939, he reorganized the unit into the Stormtrooper Division. During the French campaign, he established a great merit in breaking through in Arras and Cambrai. In the summer of 1941, the division broke through the Stalin Line on the eastern front, and was therefore nicknamed the Lightning Division. Eicke was once wounded after charging into a Soviet minefield. In the autumn of 1941, before his injuries had fully healed, he personally went to the front to command. On April 21, 1942, he received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.</p>
<p>Future of the German-Soviet War</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Berlin, 20th, by special correspondent Oshima) The German High Command announced that the German army, after destroying the military facilities of Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, immediately carried out a planned abandonment. This is the second retreat after Stalingrad. From a strategic point of view, the retreat of Stalingrad has long hinted at the fate of Rostov today. If this situation is viewed in isolation, it is certainly the focus of the current battle, but from the perspective of the overall situation, it cannot be regarded as a record of defeat, because it is worth considering carefully whether it is worth it to defend to the death at the expense of sacrifice in preparation for the third offensive. At the same time, the isolated army of Stalingrad sacrificed their precious lives for their country to the last drop of blood in order to make it easier for the large army to retreat and complete its retreat, and the conclusion on the overall victory or defeat was drawn from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not underestimate this reality. Although retreat is regarded as a common occurrence in military strategy, the loss of people and things caused by the retreat cannot be ignored. The List Army Group, which was dispatched from North Caucasus, retreated with one unit towards Rostov and the other towards the Crimean Peninsula across the Strait of Daman, recorded a daily speed of 60 kilometers. This action can be regarded as a planned retreat to avoid repeating the mistakes of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>The Western Army, which attempted to cut off its retreat route at any time from the south of Kharkov, could not prevent the southward army. At present, the main German forces are leading the residents of the area to retreat at the same time. On the other hand, in the Kharkov area, a mixed battle of modern mobile units is taking place. Some German troops are attacking west, while the Red Army is advancing east. Due to the Red Army's offensive, the German army has no choice but to gradually retreat in order to reorganize its southern operational base. The Red Army's second winter offensive has been a gamble, sacrificing manpower and resources at any cost. Domestic reserve troops have already joined the front line, and weapons, regardless of whether they are new or old, are being used to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>The current front line, in the central and southern regions, is roughly the same as the line before the second German offensive. If the Red Army is in danger of crossing the Dnipro Petrovsk and Zaporozhye, then the German retreat will be:</p>
<p>(1) The natural defensive terrain of the Dnipro River will be the front line.</p>
<p>(2) In order to prolong the Red Army's supply lines and limit its combat power to a certain extent, it will continue to retreat to this line, even at the expense of half of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The northern front has been a solid position since last March, so the fighting there today is a stalemate. Assuming that this line does not change, the confrontation line after two months, connecting north and south for about 2,000 kilometers, is about half the distance before the Red Army's second offensive, and will temporarily tend to a stalemate.</p>
<p>So far, the principles of war on both sides that have been proven in the German-Soviet war are that Germany attacks in the summer and defends in the winter, while the Soviet Union retreats in the summer and advances in the winter. Therefore, it is not possible to immediately judge the impact of their advances and retreats on the whole. However, commentators believe that the third German offensive will be difficult due to preparation and time constraints. But this is not the case. This mobilization, in view of the movement of troops, the activity of munitions factories, and the movements of Axis troops, can provide undeniable proof. Regarding the eastern front, the main issues will be:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union launched this offensive because of the urgency of the food problem, so it attempted to regain Ukraine in order to prepare for a protracted war. Therefore, can its offensive continue in the future?</p>
<p>(2) Can the industrial capacity east of the Urals and important resources such as iron, coal, etc. support the long-term war of attrition in the future?</p>
<p>(3) What is the proportion of Germany's total strength?</p>
<p>If these points are examined, various conclusions can be drawn. However, since the Second World War this year, Europe has already had North Africa, West Asia and other important factors participating; at the same time, the overall war situation has become more complex due to the insertion of political elements.

<h3>US and Chile Sign Troop Lease Agreement</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - News from Santiago, Chile, states that Chile and the United States have signed a troop lease agreement. Details regarding the obligations of the United States under the agreement are not available.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces Continue Westward Advance in Northern Tunisia, British First Army's Resistance Grows Stronger, Stalemate Between Two Armies on the Mareth Line</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch) - German forces in northern Tunisia continued to advance westward on Tuesday. The British First Army has been transferred from the south to strengthen its resistance. According to Berlin, German forces have repelled the British forces between Cape Serrat (70 kilometers west of Bizerte port on the Mediterranean coast) and Mejez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis port). A Reuters correspondent with the North African Allied Forces Headquarters also acknowledged that the German forces have made slight progress after three attacks. As for the situation in central Tunisia, Berlin said that the Allied forces are acting cautiously and slowly, only occupying the areas withdrawn by the Axis forces. In southern Tunisia, the two armies are preparing for a major battle. The British Eighth Army is gathering infantry and artillery in preparation for attacking the German positions on the Mareth Line. According to a Reuters correspondent with the British Eighth Army, the British forces are shelling and bombing the German Africa Corps. In the Tunisian mountains, British scouts patrol every hilltop, valley, and mountain path. The German forces are defending tenaciously and looking down from above. The movement of troops in the long and narrow coastal area cannot escape their observation line, and they are fiercely returning fire at the British forces.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to news from Axis and Anglo-American sources, the Tunisian front saw more intense fighting yesterday in the south and in the air. The stalemate between the two armies on the Mareth Line remains unchanged. In addition, there are fierce artillery battles and scouting battles. British military experts believe that the German defense line is in the west, where there are several mountain paths in the Matmata Mountains that can be used to pass through. As for the Gabes-Matenine railway, it is the German lifeline. The British air force is concentrating its bombing, so German transport is often carried out at night. According to an announcement from the North African Allied Forces Headquarters, French forces have occupied Taymuzhai, 50 miles west of Gafsa, and American forces have made slight progress in the Ferrania area. However, the positions withdrawn by the Axis forces are covered with landmines, which has greatly slowed the Allied advance. In northern Tunisia, German forces are still advancing victoriously in the areas of Bierville and Mejez el Bab. Axis planes are bombing the ports of Tripoli and Bona every night very intensely, while British and American planes are also attacking La Goulette and Tunis port.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Polish Border Issue Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from London, the boundary issue between the Soviet Union and Poland remains unresolved by the parties concerned. The Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union is reportedly in London discussing the matter with the authorities of the Polish government-in-exile. Furthermore, according to the "News Chronicle," the Polish side may agree to regard the Bug River as the Soviet military border and cede eastern Poland to the Soviet Union. In addition, the "Daily Sketch" reported that Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski may soon visit Moscow to discuss the Soviet-Polish border issue with Stalin in person.</p>
<h3>Spellman Visits the Vatican, Has a Special Mission, Flew to Spain from Rome Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - New York Archbishop Spellman bid farewell to the Pope the night before last, holding secret talks for over an hour. None of the Pope's confidants participated in the secret talks. Spellman also bid farewell to Pittman, the US diplomatic representative to the Vatican, the night before last. Spellman departed from Rome for Barcelona at 7:30 yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Seville, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - New York Archbishop Spellman arrived here today from Rome by plane. British Ambassador to Spain Hall also arrived at almost the same time. It is expected that both Hall and Spellman, as well as British and American military and political figures from North Africa, Gibraltar, Lisbon, and other places, will come here for a meeting. Spellman is scheduled to stay in western Spain for two days, and then return home via Gibraltar and Casablanca.</p>
<p>Vatican City, 4th (Haithong News Agency dispatch) - People close to the Vatican say that New York Archbishop Spellman's visit to Rome must have been for a special mission, probably Roosevelt's attempt to win diplomatic support and endorse the US, British, and Soviet war aims in Europe and the Mediterranean. Therefore, Spellman's trip must have been at Roosevelt's initiative. Roosevelt also wants to use Spellman's negotiations with the Vatican to carry out his campaign activities for the next presidential election. Therefore, it is widely believed that Spellman's mission is more important than entertainment. In total, Spellman stayed in the Vatican for twelve days, meeting with the Pope five times, for a total of about six hours of talks. The content of his talks is kept extremely secret, and even senior Vatican officials do not know. However, according to well-informed sources, the Vatican's attitude is impartial and does not seem to endorse the war aims of any of the belligerent countries. It also believes that the Casablanca Declaration's demand for the unconditional surrender of the Tripartite Pact countries is completely contrary to Christian principles. It is also reported that Spellman urged the Vatican to change its attitude towards the Soviet Union. But one thing can be advised to Spellman, that is, the continued existence of orderly German-Italian regimes in Europe can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Allied Economic Conference Held in London</h3>

<h3>Japanese Strength Cannot Be Underestimated, Woodhead Publishes Article, Reviews Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Woodhead, the former editor of the "Oriental Affairs" and a famous British journalist in Shanghai, published an article in the "Manchester Guardian" yesterday after returning home earlier this year, reviewing the Pacific War situation, stating, "If anyone thinks that Japan will be unable to withstand a single blow once Hitler and Mussolini are subdued, this is an extremely dangerous wishful thinking. It is a pity that our country does not have an ambassador like Grew, who was the US ambassador to Japan for ten years, familiar with the situation in Japan. After returning home, he warned his countrymen of the severity of the situation at every opportunity, and repeatedly stated that it is an illusion to think that Japan will collapse before suffering a fatal setback, and the result will be disappointment."</p>
<h3>US Navy Recruiting New Soldiers</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, US Secretary of the Navy Knox announced a new navy recruitment plan yesterday, stating that the United States must prepare for 10% of its troops to be killed or wounded. This recruitment plan is based on the assumption that one in ten naval personnel will need to be replaced.</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Fast Ends: British Governor's Attitude Unchanged, Orders Ban on Indian Celebrations; Anglo-Indian Negotiations Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Turkish Capital: Gandhi's fast concluded at 8 AM yesterday. Celebrations planned by the Indian people were banned by the government. The Anglo-Indian negotiation issue remains deadlocked. It is reported that the All-India Congress Committee will hold a meeting in Bombay next week, at which time they will request the Governor-General to allow them to send representatives to meet with Gandhi to discuss political issues.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: The Bombay government announced that Mahatma Gandhi's 21-day fast ended yesterday. His health has improved. He consumed orange juice, honey, and water during the day and slept peacefully at night. Furthermore, according to Pune, when Gandhi's fast ended at 8 AM yesterday, he closed his eyes and prayed silently, while his wife and others recited prayers. Gandhi was then given orange juice by his wife, which he slowly drank. The Indian government also announced that the original detention measures for Gandhi and others would continue as before.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Stockholm: A dispatch from New Delhi states that the Indian Viceroy's Office announced on the 3rd that Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Haku, is scheduled to return home in the coming days for important consultations.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Publish Articles: Advice to the Government</p>
<p>Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital: London newspapers all published commentaries today on the Gandhi fast. Conservative newspapers are making every effort to diminish its importance and say that emotional reactions should be avoided. However, according to the liberal London Star, the impact of Gandhi's actions may not yet be fully understood by Westerners. While we are fortunate that his life is not in danger despite the fast, his fast has not achieved its intended purpose, as he remains confined and Anglo-Indian negotiations have not resumed. Recently, three Indian officials in the Indian Viceroy's Office resigned, demonstrating Gandhi's spiritual power, which we should pay attention to. In short, the only solution to the Indian question is mutual compromise.</p>
<p>The History of Gandhi's Struggle</p>
<p>Three Days Ago, Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital: Indian national leader Mahatma Gandhi, angered by the British government's refusal to negotiate Indian independence, protested by fasting, which has been of concern worldwide. Now that Gandhi's 21-day fast has come to a satisfactory end today, the world is greatly relieved to hear the news. The fast ended at 4 AM this morning. Gandhi looked tired but remained cheerful. This great man, whose successive fasts have shaken the world, was born into a middle-class family in 1869. His family was devoutly religious and abstained from harming living beings. According to traditional custom, he was engaged at the age of eight and married at the age of twelve. At the age of eighteen, he passed the university entrance examination and went to London to study law. At that time, Gandhi participated in social activities and even studied dance, but social life was not to his liking, so he soon turned to the pursuit of pure knowledge, beginning to translate the works of the Greek philosopher Plato and study the writings of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy, whose thought greatly influenced him. After studying in England for three years, he returned to India as a lawyer. In 1893, he went to Johannesburg, South Africa, and became a well-known lawyer. Soon after, he abandoned his old profession and devoted himself to the interests of Indians in South Africa. During this period, he was arrested several times for offending the authorities. He was imprisoned for the first time in South Africa for fifteen months. On one occasion, he was beaten nearly to death by misunderstanding Indian compatriots. In 1914, World War I broke out. Gandhi wanted to serve England, hoping that England would be moved to grant India autonomy after the war. However, after the war, England intensified its new imperialist policies toward India. Gandhi was greatly disappointed and angrily returned to the Indian Governor-General the medal awarded to him by the British government. From then on, he advocated non-cooperation, also the greatest ideological movement in modern history. For a time, Indians withdrew from British-controlled institutions, Indian children left British schools, refused to buy British goods, and refused to pay taxes, causing a major threat to the British. But at the end of the non-cooperation movement, it turned into riots. Gandhi then ordered it to stop, and those who did not understand even denounced him as a traitor, and his reputation greatly declined. He was soon arrested and sentenced to six years of imprisonment. In 1924, he was released due to a gangrenous appendicitis operation, having been imprisoned for only two years. By this time, new people were leading the independence movement, so he retired to cultivate himself. At the same time, the Indian revolutionary movement spread. In 1929, the Indian Congress Party asked Gandhi to resume leading the independence movement, launching the "non-violent disobedience" movement in March of the year zero. He was imprisoned again a few weeks later and released in January of the following year. But because he continued to carry out revolutionary movements as before, he was imprisoned again. Before the outbreak of this World War, Gandhi devoted himself to understanding between Muslims and Hindus. Last August, he was arrested and imprisoned again for carrying out independence actions and remains so to this day.</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Carry Out Retaliation: London Attacked Twice; Over Four Hundred Killed and Injured in the Bombing of Berlin; Famous Ancient Church Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: According to reports from London, after British aircraft bombed Berlin on Tuesday, German aircraft also attacked London twice last night. Bombs also fell on East Anglia and southeastern England, but the extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Swedish Maritime News Agency, Swedish Capital: A London dispatch states that German aircraft attacked London last night. Anti-aircraft fire was used to prevent German aircraft from approaching the city center. Several bombs fell on the outskirts, causing little damage.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Berlin: It is announced here that on the night of the 1st of this month, British aircraft blindly bombed civilians and non-military facilities in Berlin. The number of residents killed and injured has increased to 459, including 191 killed and 268 injured.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Berlin: When British air force bombed Berlin on the 11th, they completely destroyed the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at the eastern end of the Kurfürstendamm. The church, modeled after the Roman Pantheon Church, began construction in 1747 and was not completed until 1773, taking nearly thirty years. This time, it was completely reduced to ashes by the air force bombing, so the citizens of Berlin are all resentful of the inhumane behavior of the British air force.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Portuguese Alliance News Agency, Lisbon: The British Air Ministry announced that British aircraft bombed Hamburg last night, losing ten bombers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force's Consolidated Results in the India-Burma Border Region</h3>
<p>Four Days Ago, Central News Agency, Tokyo: Japanese Army Air Force units have been actively continuing operations in the India-Burma border region for days. On February 23rd and 25th, they fiercely attacked the aviation relay base airfield between Kunming and India, destroying 15 large transport planes on the ground and shooting down 5 enemy fighters taking off. They also shot down enemy fighters near Akyab in the Arakan region. The consolidated results for February include 26 enemy aircraft shot down (2 of which are unconfirmed) and 15 destroyed, with 31 shot down by ground fire (14 of which are unconfirmed), for a total of 72. Recently, 6 Japanese aircraft have self-destructed or not returned. Although the enemy has attempted to launch aerial guerrilla warfare against Yangon and within Burmese territory, they have all been shot down by Japanese fighters. In particular, on the 28th, Japanese aircraft shot down 7 enemy fighters over Arakan without a single Japanese aircraft being hit by enemy fire, demonstrating the significant disparity in combat skills between the British and Japanese air forces. Currently, the enemy is lacking pilots and is using untrained pilots in actual combat. Furthermore, because the China-Soviet aircraft base at Ke-Ya has been bombed and the air transport route to Chongqing has been cut off, Chongqing is feeling increasingly distressed.</p>
<p>Four Days Ago, Central News Agency, Lisbon: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters announced on the 3rd that British air force units lost one aircraft during an air raid on Burma on the 1st.</p>

<h3>From Chongqing to Washington</h3>
<p>— Jiao Yun</p>
<p>Passing through India and Africa along the way, the entire journey takes about twenty days</p>
<p>Since the disruption of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Chongqing's international route has been rerouted via India, leading many to worry about traffic congestion. Recently, a guest returned from the United States and provided a detailed account of his journey, which is worth reading for those who have not personally made the trip.</p>
<p>(En Route through India and Africa) With the Sino-Indian Highway not yet completed today, travel from Chongqing to India relies on airplanes. Although there are many high mountains, they do not pose an obstacle. Taking off from Chongqing around noon, one can arrive in Calcutta by 10 PM that night. The journey of thousands of miles takes only ten hours. Calcutta is the transportation hub of India, with flourishing trade and is the largest metropolis in India, known as the "London of India." Living expenses here are not very high; ten or so Indian rupees can solve the problem of food and lodging. However, one thing to note is that legal tender cannot be used in the area and must be exchanged for Indian rupees. It is best to purchase rupees in Chongqing, as the exchange rate is higher in Calcutta. From Calcutta to the United States, there were direct flights, but the schedule was inconvenient. There are many flights from Karachi on the west coast of India, so people often take a train to Karachi and then transfer to an airplane. The train from Calcutta to Karachi traverses all of India. The roadbed is flat. Along the way, one can see the magnificent British Governor-General's residence in New Delhi, the capital of India. Arriving in Karachi in three days, there are few people and one can take a plane at any time to Cairo. The flight from Karachi passes through Basra, Iraq, and other places, and crosses a strait. This section of the route is often windy, and the aircraft shakes unsteadily, causing passengers quite a bit of discomfort. It takes two days to reach Cairo. Cairo is located on the Nile Delta. There are many historical sites in the suburbs, and the world-famous pyramids stand there. The towers were built 6,000 years ago, with the larger ones reaching hundreds of feet in height. All those who visit Egypt go there to pay their respects.</p>
<p>From Karachi to Cairo, British airplanes are used. After Cairo, one transfers to an American airplane. These several days are like flying over the ocean, a vast expanse with no signs of human habitation. One only sees a flat desert, because one is flying over the African desert. Gradually flying west, one begins to see Africa. In about five days, one arrives in Lagos, Nigeria, like another new world. Everything one sees is thriving. The facilities there are modern, the streets are bustling, and all modern equipment is available. If it were not for the fact that the people are all black, one would suspect they were in Europe or America.</p>
<p>(Crossing the Atlantic) From here on, taking the Clipper flying boat is extremely comfortable. One reaches the city of Vital in Brazil in only one day. Everything one saw before was dry, and only here does one enter a refreshing realm. It rains there several times a day. The people are neatly dressed, and the streets are very clean. However, most people speak Portuguese and do not understand English, causing inconvenience for travelers. The next major air station is Belem in Brazil, which is an ancient city. The station before that is the British island of Trinidad. Passing this, one enters U.S. territory. The first place where the aircraft lands in the U.S. is Miami in the south. The climate is warm there, and many Americans go there to avoid the cold. People swim year-round. From here to Washington, one can still take an airplane, or a train. The train travels extremely fast, arriving in Washington in about one day.</p>
<p>In total, the entire journey takes about thirty days. As for the airfare, between March and April, it costs more than 3,500 yuan from Chongqing to Calcutta and about 2,000 US dollars from India to the U.S. Today, it costs much more than those amounts. There is another route from India to the U.S., that is, taking a boat from Bombay. However, with the war situation there, most ships are being used to transport military supplies. Passenger ships are scarce. If one can find a way to board a ship transporting military supplies back to the US, it will cost 1,000 to 2,000 yuan and take one or two months to reach the US. It is not as difficult as imagined, but those going abroad must obtain visas for all countries in advance, otherwise they will face considerable trouble along the way. (Mailed January 10, 1932)</p>
<h3>A Postscript on the Japanese Army's Entry into Guangzhouwan: Agreement Signed Between Japan and France</h3>
<p>The elite of the Japanese army, with courage, advanced and occupied the Leizhou Peninsula in one fell swoop. On February 20, they broke into the French concession boundary of Guangzhouwan at the Cunkin Bridge, eliminating the Chongqing army's attempt at foolish action. The Japanese army was disciplined and refused to rashly violate the border line, and stationed itself at a certain distance. When the Japanese army approached the Cunkin Bridge after passing through Mazhang, the Chongqing army concentrated there attempted to ambush. However, because of the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army collapsed and scattered without even being able to fight.</p>
<p>Army Colonel 〇〇, who had gone to Guangzhouwan beforehand to make diplomatic overtures, and Captain Penny, a member of the French side, came to the Cunkin Bridge at 4:30 PM on the 20th to greet the unit commander. The unit commander, unhurriedly, exchanged a few words of greeting, then took a car specially prepared to welcome the unit commander. The entire force lined up and saluted as the car drove into the concession. After arriving, the unit commander began formal negotiations with de Maux, the governor of the French concession. The two sides immediately reached an understanding, and signed an agreement locally on the 21st.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony on the 21st at 11 AM (Japanese time) was held at the governor's residence. Governor de Maux first gave a speech, congratulating Japan on its prosperity and the stability of East Asia. Next, the unit commander emphasized the friendly relations between Japan and France, hoping that the French side would cooperate closely. Then, Army Colonel ○○ read out the articles of the agreement on the joint defense of the French concession of Guangzhouwan, and Lieutenant ○○ translated it into French and read it again. With the agreement of both parties, the unit commander and Governor de Maux signed the agreement, with each holding a copy.</p>
<p>Part of the force stationed at the Cunkin Bridge began to enter the city of Chikan on the opposite bank of the Cunkin Bridge at 2:30 PM on the 21st, with the full understanding of the French side. They exchanged greetings with the French garrison soldiers at the bridge, and the people along the road cheered. The military appearance was neat, and they passed through the city's main street. After resting for a while at the sports field on the western edge of the city, they circled the city's main street again, and returned to their current station at the Cunkin Bridge at 4 PM.</p>
<p>The citizens of Guangzhouwan praised the majesty of the Japanese army, and the friendly relations between China, Japan, and France were further strengthened. Most of the enemy elements in Guangzhouwan fled to the interior, and public order was completely restored. (Ren: Translated from the February 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Successful Landing on the Leizhou Peninsula</p>
<p>(Guangzhouwan, February 23rd, Special Dispatch) On the 16th of February, under the clear moonlight, the Japanese army landed on the east coast of Leizhou in a surprise attack, and at the same time occupied the Leizhou Peninsula. The Chongqing side was panic-stricken. The Japanese army learned that the main force of the 155th Division under Yu Hanmou of the Seventh War Zone and the Third Division under Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone were being transferred to the county seat of Suixi. After occupying Leizhou, the Japanese army immediately pursued them north, launching an attack on Suixi. The roads in that area were rugged, and the rear could not provide supplies, so it was necessary to carry a large amount of food and medicine.</p>
<p>Seeing the Japanese army pursuing them so closely, the Chongqing army knew that there was no way out, so they did not want to escape anymore and counterattacked desperately, launching small engagements everywhere. However, the Japanese army advanced bravely without stopping for a moment, crossing the front line for 150 kilometers without resting at all. With a fearless spirit of courage, they finally overcame all difficulties and rushed into the county seat of Suixi at 4 PM on the 19th.

<p>Maintaining Strength for Complete Security</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Preparatory Committee: Tightens Overdraft Discounting; Hopes for Gradual Return of Loans; Avoid Overdrafts Unless Necessary</h3>
<p>Due to the recent sudden increase in floating capital in Shanghai, the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee has tightened its overdraft discounting measures for fellow banks and sent a circular to all fellow banks to investigate. The following is a transcription of this notice: "Upon investigation, in December of the 30th year [1941], at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the city's money supply suddenly tightened. This committee, in accordance with the resolution of the Temporary Joint Association of Banking Industries, handled overdraft discounting matters. In the spring of the 31st year [1942], the market eased slightly, and the funds discounted by fellow banks were gradually selected for return. Until May of the same year, on the eve of the government's implementation of the consolidation of old currency, due to many rumors, a run on deposits occurred among fellow banks. This committee again responded to the needs of fellow banks by appropriately supplying funds, which greatly helped to adjust the extremely tight market at that time. Afterwards, the market became looser, and this committee gradually tightened its discounting.</p>
<p>Using Low-Interest Funds; Contradicts Original Intent of Discounting</p>
<p>However, recently, among fellow banks, there are still those who request discounting from the committee even during peacetime when the market is not tight, or those who have not yet returned funds discounted long after the tense period has passed. The purpose of this committee's discounting is purely to assist fellow banks when they are in need and their payment capacity is not sufficient by appropriately supplying funds. It is not intended to be a constant supply of low-interest funds for daily operations. Therefore, assuming that this committee were to approve all of the above-mentioned peacetime requests from fellow banks and make constant discounts, then in the event of a sudden tightening of the market, in order to meet the needs that absolutely cannot be spared at that time, we would inevitably have to more than double the discounting, which would not be effective. This would have the disadvantage of promoting credit inflation during peacetime, and would feel like a drop in the bucket in an emergency, which is not a complete solution.</p>
<p>Fellow Banks are Known for Stability; Tightening Should be Understood</p>
<p>This committee must be extremely cautious. Therefore, we have carefully reviewed peacetime requests from fellow banks, only granting small amounts of discounting or politely refusing to lend, and the reason for this is due to this. Both the committee and fellow banks should maintain strength to ensure complete security. It is deeply hoped that fellow banks that have already discounted funds can gradually return them, and those that have not originally discounted funds should preferably not discount unless necessary. Our fellow banks operate steadily and have a solid foundation. I am sure they are well aware of the above points. However, fearing that there may still be one or two fellow banks who do not fully understand why this committee's handling of discounting is too strict, we have specially sent this circular. We hope you will investigate.</p>
<p>Banks and Financial Institutions Review Loan Applications with Extreme Caution</p>
<p>Shanghai correspondent learned yesterday from bankers that in order to prevent the use of commodity collateral to facilitate funds and to encourage hoarding and speculation, banks and financial institutions will handle all loans as follows: (1) Mortgage loans will be handled in accordance with the "Rules for the Prohibition of Commodity-Backed Loans" promulgated by the Ministry; (2) Credit loans are limited to production industries in various industries. All applicants for loans, whether mortgage or credit, must explain the purpose of the loan. After strict review, if it is deemed that the purpose is indeed legitimate, the loan will be approved. For credit loans and overdrafts, there must be a reliable guarantor who guarantees not only the timely payment of the loan, but also that the loan will not be used for speculative hoarding.</p>
<p>Collateralized Loans on Chinese Stocks Based on Par Value</p>
<p>The three measures for implementing restrictions on loans promulgated by the Ministry have all been followed by banks and financial institutions. From now on, the collateral discounts for those approved for loans after review will be calculated based on the official price and will never be based on the black market standard. For example, the collateralization of Chinese stocks is based on the par value of the stocks. As for food, cotton yarn, and daily necessities such as soap and matches, they will not be accepted at all. Those that have already been done must be redeemed within a time limit. Banks and financial institutions have each established a loan review committee to preside over the review matters. If it is found that a borrower is using the loaned funds for speculative hoarding, the authorities will be reported to investigate and deal with the matter according to law.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Office Adds Staff; Purchase Certificates for Five Items; Sets Date for Supplementary Collection</h3>
<p>Since the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council began issuing purchase certificates for edible oil and sugar according to population, the work of the various distribution offices has become more complicated. Therefore, starting on the 28th of last month, 28 employees have been hired and assigned to various offices to handle the issuance of certificates.</p>
<p>Since the various distribution certificate issuing offices of the Shanghai Municipal Council issued (1) the eighth batch of rice purchase certificates, (2) flour purchase certificates, (3) sugar purchase certificates, (4) oil purchase certificates, and (5) miscellaneous grain certificates, it has been decided that issuance will end on the 9th of this month. However, those who have not yet received the oil purchase certificate and the miscellaneous grain certificate, and whose designated collection location is the Racecourse, can collect them on the 11th. Those whose designated collection location is outside the Racecourse can collect them on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Chongming to Undergo Rural Clearing; District Office to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>According to reports from Chongming, the district office of this district has recently been ordered to reorganize into the Chongming Special District Office of the Shanghai Branch of the Rural Clearing Committee of the National Government, under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Rural Clearing Branch. District Chief Jin Guanfu took office as the head of the special district office on March 1, announcing it to the people. At the same time, various rural clearing works are being actively prepared, and it is scheduled to begin rural clearing on April 10th or 15th.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement to Prepare for Event; Youth Corps Inspection to be Held; Mayor Chen and Other Officials to Attend the Inspection; City Corps Inauguration Ceremony to be Held at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The central government has stipulated that the 30th of this month will be the third anniversary of the return to the capital. Various localities should hold a general inspection of youth corps on this day. Shanghai has stipulated that the New Life Movement is responsible for the preparation. In order to ensure that all preparations are thorough, the association has specially invited the Security Command of the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education, the Education Committee, and various experts to form a preparatory committee. The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday, attended by Zheng Wukui, the section chief of the Municipal Government, and more than 20 experts such as Ding Chao and Le Xiurong. The meeting was chaired by Xi Peiwen, a member of the New Life Movement. It was decided that the general inspection will be held from 1 PM to 3:30 PM on March 30. The location is scheduled to be the Racecourse. 540 members of the youth corps and 2,400 members of the youth group, for a total of 2,940 people, will participate in the inspection. The inspecting officer will be Mayor Chen, and the accompanying officers will be members of the New Life Movement and Chinese and foreign officials. It is also reported that the City Corps Inauguration Ceremony will be held at the same time.</p>
<h3>Fifth Phase of Grain Distribution in Western Shanghai; Sales Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The fifth phase of grain distribution according to population in the western Shanghai district began universally yesterday. Residents can bring their fifth-phase rice tickets to designated rice shops to purchase grain. It is reported that this time the distribution will be 1.6 liters of foreign rice and 0.7 liters of broken rice, for a total of 4.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Health Departments of Both Concessions to Administer Smallpox Vaccinations; Certificate Required for Travel</h3>
<p>The free smallpox vaccination campaign conducted by the health departments of both concessions has been progressing smoothly and rapidly in recent days. The Public Concession is carrying out vaccinations through various health sub-offices, while the French Concession is sending personnel to various Lianbao [community self-defense units] to carry out vaccinations collectively. The China Epidemic Prevention Committee has also launched smallpox vaccinations. In the future, passengers traveling by train or ship to other places will be required to have a smallpox vaccination certificate issued by the authorities in order to pass.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Welfare Bureau Established; Continues Soup Kitchen Operations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau was officially established on the 1st of this month. The newly appointed director, Sun Mingqi, has also arrived to assume his duties. The bureau, by order of the Municipal Government, in accordance with the proposals passed by the Supreme National Defense Conference and the National Defense Implementation Order, merged the Municipal Social Movement Association and the Shanghai Branch of the Accounting Committee. Therefore, it has successively taken over the two associations, including all documents and files, as well as the soup kitchen at 220 Wuding Road and the preparatory office of the Nankin Road Orphanage, one by one. As for the soup kitchen, it is now managed by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, and the soup kitchen operations will continue to benefit the impoverished refugees. The various soup kitchens sponsored by the Municipal Winter Account Committee are still operated by the committee and have not yet been transferred to the Social Welfare Bureau.</p>
<h3>Women's Welfare Association to Hold Symposium; Held at 3 PM on the 8th; Discussing the Role of Women</h3>

The association has now scheduled a Sino-Japanese Women's Symposium to be held at Dake Building at 3 PM on Women's Day on the 8th of this month. At that time, Chinese and Japanese intellectual women will be invited to attend and discuss the responsibilities that women should bear.</p>
<p>Reader's Forum</p>
<h3>Organization of a Teachers' Welfare Association</h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in today's society, the profession with the heaviest responsibilities and the lowest compensation is undoubtedly that of teachers. As a result, many experienced and knowledgeable teachers, due to meager salaries and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, have abandoned their teaching positions and entered other professions. Consequently, schools, lacking qualified teachers, have had to bring in people without proper qualifications to fill the gaps, leading to a decline in student performance in recent years. No wonder some are calling for a "rectification of teacher qualifications."</p>
<p>This serious problem seems to have gradually attracted attention from various sectors of society recently. Doctors provide free medical care to teachers, stores and factories offer discounts on goods for teachers, and newspapers collect donations from enthusiastic supporters for teachers. These individuals sympathize with teachers and understand that teachers' inability to settle into their positions is a significant loss to society. Therefore, they are willing to do their best to help teachers and alleviate their financial burdens. Their sincerity and insightful vision are commendable. However, due to their independent efforts, various initiatives appear scattered and lack an overall system. Furthermore, teachers, being knowledgeable and capable, should not remain in a passive position for long. They should have a well-organized structure to leverage collective strength, gather various forms of assistance, and maximize efficiency to benefit every teacher in the city. Therefore, I propose the establishment of a Teachers' Welfare Association.</p>
<p>The organization can begin with several prominent schools jointly sending a letter to every school in the city, instructing them to send representatives to elect officers and prepare for the organization. Teachers from each school would be automatic members. To save expenses, the association's office could be located at a school with ample space.</p>
<p>The association's purpose is to gather various forms of assistance from society, ensure the stability of teachers' livelihoods, and indirectly improve teaching efficiency. Therefore, the association's future activities should be adjusted based on the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Seek doctors of various specialties to provide free medical care and midwifery services to teachers and their families, so that they can avoid the burden of medical expenses during illness and childbirth.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This newspaper's establishment of a medical aid fund for primary school teachers is based on this idea. To date, many enthusiastic individuals have generously donated, and numerous renowned doctors and hospitals have arranged preferential treatment. This will undoubtedly greatly benefit teachers' health. Information about the medical aid fund for primary school teachers is published in the social services section of this newspaper. Please pay attention.)</p>
<p>(2) Solicit discounted goods from stores and factories to reduce teachers' living expenses.</p>
<p>(3) Directly request allocations of various controlled daily necessities from the authorities and distribute them evenly to all members.</p>
<p>(4) Request schools to increase the number of tuition-free or reduced-tuition slots for teachers' children. If the school does not have such slots, consider providing partial or full financial assistance.</p>
<p>(5) Establish a loan fund. Teachers can apply to the association in the event of weddings, funerals, or other major events. Subsequently, no interest will be charged, and repayments can be made in installments.</p>
<p>As for the source of funding, I suggest the following avenues:</p>
<p>(1) Request subsidies from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>(2) Request voluntary performances and fundraising from enthusiastic theater groups, box offices, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Members can solicit donations from relatives and friends.</p>
<p>(4) Ask newspapers to collect donations from sympathetic individuals.</p>
<p>The above are my humble suggestions to initiate discussion. Detailed plans still need to be further developed by insightful individuals.</p>

<h3>Wu Hufan Sells a Painting of Willow Catkins for Charity, All Proceeds to Be Used for Scholarships</h3>
<p>Shen Zhou of the Ming Dynasty painted a scroll of willow catkins for Zhu Yehang (Zhu Cunli, author of "Iron Net Coral"), with Shen Zhou himself writing poems and lyrics, and Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, Yang Xunji, and Lu Baoshan each adding inscriptions. It can be said to have been a grand event at the time. This spring, Mr. Wu Hufan had the opportunity to view the original scroll. He was inspired and playfully copied it, also transcribing Shen Zhou's original inscription. He then asked his students Zhao Gonghuan, Wang Jiqian, Xu Yue, and Lu Yifei to separately transcribe the inscriptions of Wen, Tang, Yang, and Lu. Coincidentally, the exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by the Meijing Studio was held at the Ningbo Association from March 5th to 10th. Mr. Hufan, mindful of the many young people in Shanghai who had dropped out of school, displayed this painting scroll for charity sale (auction style) at the exhibition, with all proceeds to be used for scholarships and loans from the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers. It is believed that there are many people in the country who admire Mr. Hufan's art and are enthusiastic about supporting young people's education to make this charitable act a success.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Spokesperson Explains Operational Guidelines</h3>
<p>The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai, at the regular Thursday reception for journalists yesterday (the 4th) at 2:00 PM, explained to the press corps the changes in the operational guidelines of the Japanese army since the start of the Greater East Asia War. The conversation was as follows:</p>
<p>Changing Guidelines</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesperson spoke about the changing operational guidelines of the Japanese army: "From 1940 until the start of the Greater East Asia War, the operational guidelines adopted the Bicester strategy, launching attacks on Chongqing army strongholds at any time, in order to crush Chongqing's dreams of using the Yunnan-Burma Road for supplies and then launching a general counteroffensive. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing lost the Yunnan-Burma Road, which had been used to train the Chongqing army, and had no power to implement a general counteroffensive. The purpose of changing the previous operational guidelines is to (1) thoroughly destroy Chongqing's resistance forces, and (2) actively develop and cultivate the political and economic forces in the areas where the National Government is located, in order to ensure the completion of the Greater East Asia War. For example, the Japanese army implemented the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation last year, dividing the eastern Zhejiang areas of Jinhua, Lanxi, Wuyi, etc. Not only has security been maintained to this day, but the National Government's politics and economy have also been cultivated. The contribution to the development of resources in the Greater East Asia War has been significant. The current operations in Wuhan and northern Jiangsu have the same significance. In terms of Wuhan, the security of the east bank of the Yangtze River from Yuezhou to Yichang is ensured. The political forces of the National Government have become more enriched and cultivated because the security is maintained by the armies of China and Japan. In terms of northern Jiangsu, the cleaning-up work will begin in Huai'an and various parts of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Developing Ideas</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesperson said, "If we can develop this operational guiding ideology, then the entire Hunan and Sichuan can be secured, and at the same time, developing and opening up the idea of transportation routes will lead to operations to connect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route directly to the Vietnam-Yunnan-Burma Road. However, how to establish this idea, if lacking sufficient strength, will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, Japan is fully assisting the National Government in fully developing its military and political power, which can coincide with Japan's operational ideas. Only in this way can the construction of a new China be realized. Looking at the current operations in northern Jiangsu and Wuhan, the National Government army has ensured and maintained security, proving that the National Government's power has been strengthened, and the significance of China's participation in the war can be seen here.</p>
<p>American Actions</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the above matters. However, Chongqing's observation of this operational guideline of the Japanese army is completely wrong. They mistakenly believe that the purpose of the Japanese army's operations on the Yunnan-Burma Line is to contain the Chongqing army's restoration of the original route. Therefore, the military authorities of the stealing party are currently transferring considerable troops to the Yunnan-Burma border, and at the same time consulting with the British authorities in India on a joint counteroffensive plan. In fact, the purpose of the Japanese army's operations in Yunnan is completely the same as the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the Japanese army is attacking the Chongqing army in Yunnan and the British-Indian army on the India-Burma border. Finally, I would like to give the following facts for your reference. According to the Lend-Lease Act announced by the American authorities, the total amount of materials provided to anti-Axis countries last year included 36 ships of materials transported to Chongqing and 304 ships of materials provided to the Soviet Union. 1,445 ships transporting British supplies. At the same time, the U.S. House of Representatives made a speech on this matter, raising questions, saying that it is estimated that only 2% of U.S. aid to Chongqing materials, while aid to British materials, then it reached 67%. From this it can be seen that U.S. aid to Chongqing materials is quite difficult, and Chongqing's hopes have completely failed."</p>
<h3>Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Guangzhao Association, Encourages the Current Directors of the Association to Inherit the Responsibility of the Predecessors for Donating and Lending Funds; Relying on the Joint Support of Compatriots from Both Prefectures</h3>
<p>The Guangzhao Association has a long history in Shanghai, as everyone knows. According to Mr. Wen Zongyao, Chairman of the Association, among the associations from various places in Shanghai, the Guangzhao Association is the most successful. It not only cares for the education of the children of Guangzhao compatriots, but also rescues those who are displaced, and takes care of the deceased. It is also not behind other local associations. Chairman Wang also mentioned the Revolution of 1911 in his New Year's Day address to the National Government, relying on the strength of the Guangzhao Association to raise 400,000 taels. The current directors of the Guangzhao Association can be proud of the association, and the Guangzhao people in Shanghai can rely on the association for their well-being. However, there is one point that Guangzhao people must not forget, and the directors of the association must be vigilant. Most of the associations in other provinces and counties are gathered from the entire province or county, and are mostly formed by fundraising. Only the Guangzhao Association has been established by a few powerful people in Shanghai who have been inspired by public justice and gathered funds to initiate it since the initial establishment of the association in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. They do not receive funds from other counties besides Guangzhao, nor have they raised funds from all Guangzhao compatriots in Shanghai. From the example of Xu Yuzhi, Ye Guzhi, and Pan Weichen, the seniors who initiated self-donation first, the association has since set up new public properties and new ventures. The cost is lacking, and the directors are responsible for it. Finally, a large amount of funds were used to reorganize the Guangzhao New Mountain Villa, and they were also borrowed from the directors. They established the great cause of a 450-mu public cemetery. The current directors, Tan Haiqiu, Chen Xuejia, Hu Guoliang, Chen Guangcheng, etc., are all fathers, sons, uncles, and nephews who have succeeded each other as directors. Non-villagers must entrust the directors to the gentlemen. They feel grateful for the kindness of Tan Ganchen, Chen Kelang, Hu Yaoting, Chen Bingqian and other seniors for donating and lending money and supporting the association. They can't help but choose their children. They also thought that in the future, they would inevitably have to borrow money again to expand their careers. It is impossible for them to take on the responsibility without the efforts of the gentlemen. They are directors not to dominate the rights of the association but to donate and lend money. As directors of the association, they have the responsibility to maintain the present and expand the future. Zongyao is old and takes on this responsibility. Every time the association faces difficulties, he can't help but be anxious. The directors have the same love for their hometown, so they must know how to be vigilant. It is not that Zongyao is talking too much, the taller ones are easy to fall, and the full ones are easy to overflow. The Guangzhao Association's point of worry and danger lies in the envy of the onlookers. If the current directors' spirit is slightly relaxed, the hard work of the past directors will be ruined. The reality is that the Guangzhao villagers understand the truth of the association, and help it with what it can't do. The directors must be able to fulfill their duties, and then the Guangzhao Association can be at peace, and then the Guangzhao villagers can rely on the association to be at peace. The Guangzhao Association in the past was promoted by a few Guangzhao senior predecessors, and the future of the Guangzhao Association will rely on the support of all Guang-Zhao villagers. The Guangzhao Association is the only public association for the people of the two prefectures of Guangzhao, and the people of the two prefectures of Guangzhao must still be happy to have this unique responsibility for the association.</p>

Regarding the issuance of sugar purchase certificates, the Public Concession (including Hongkou) is entrusted to the Public Works Department to handle, the French Concession is entrusted to the Board of Directors, and Huxi Zhabei Nanshi is entrusted to the Grain Administration Bureau. According to the total amount approved by the military rationing authority each month, the Cooperative Business Office will then determine the amount of sugar rationed per household each period. It is reported that the first phase will be issued from March 11th with a valid certificate until the 31st. The price is calculated according to the new limited price set by the Cooperative Business Office. As for the quantity of sugar rationed per person in the first phase, it has been internally determined to be eight ounces per person. The authorities will announce it at that time. The Cooperative Business Office has notified all retailers yesterday that preparations for the rationing of sugar by population must be completed by February 10th. All sugar needed for business purposes after implementation will continue to be applied for.</p>
<p>Instructing Retailers to Collect Report Forms</p>
<p>The Cooperative Business Office notified the Type A retailers registered to sell rationed sugar to pay attention to the following points yesterday: (1) Each store should prepare a sugar sales report form. Every 100 sugar purchase certificates collected each period must be pasted on the sugar sales report form. (2) The paper for the report form has been prepared by the Public Works Department and entrusted to this office for distribution. Each sheet is sold for 8 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates. (3) Each registered store must calculate how many report forms to purchase based on the number of sugar purchase certificates that should be collected as specified in the circular from the Public Works Department, and prepare the funds to purchase them from this office starting immediately.</p>
<p>Establishing Rules and Strictly Complying</p>
<p>The Rationing Section of the Goods Control Office of the Public Works Department sent a letter to the Cooperative Business Office to inform all Type A retailers of the following points: (1) After receiving the original, it should be properly preserved and read carefully at any time. (2) After the copy is stamped with the store's seal and the responsible person's seal, it should be handed over to this office for collection and returned to the Public Works Department for filing.

If there is anything you do not understand, the person in charge must come to the office to inquire.</p>
<p>Effective Date of the First Batch of Food</p>
<p>The regulations for retailers handling rationed sugar include nine articles, stipulating that the sugar purchase certificates for the first period can be used to buy sugar during the first period. The first period is from March 11th to March 31st of this year. If it is not convenient to use during that period, the certificate will be invalidated. The sugar purchase certificates for the second period can only be used to purchase sugar during the second period, and so on. The start and end dates of each period will be announced by the office period by period. As for the excess of sugar sold by each retailer based on certificates, it will be stored as sugar and must not be short. Violators will be fined ten times the amount of the shortage.</p>
<h3>Special Issue on Various Places in Southeast Asia, No. 5: The Ups and Downs of the Dutch East Indies (5)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Song</p>
<p>(6) The Influence of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Foreign capital invading the Dutch East Indies mostly shifted from cultivation to mining, and then penetrated into the industrial sector. Recently, there have been two phenomena in the industrial capital of the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>First, the modern industries in the Dutch East Indies were built by foreign capital (including Dutch) and overseas Chinese capital, the main one being the weaving industry, followed by motor factories, tire factories, etc. Of this modern industrial capital, Dutch capital accounts for about 15-16%, overseas Chinese capital accounts for about 22-23%, and the rest is British and American capital.</p>
<p>Second, the operating scale of handicrafts is gradually expanding, and the operators of some departments are overseas Chinese. Their capital has a trend from family industry to factory-system handicrafts. Because industrialization in the Dutch East Indies is still in a very early stage, the investment of the great powers in industry is much smaller than the investment in agriculture and mining, and the power of handicrafts is held by the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The former Minister of Economy of the Dutch East Indies, Mr. Hengmok, once said: "The development of the industry in the Dutch East Indies must rely on the mutual cooperation of the Dutch, Indonesian Asians, and Chinese," emphasizing the important position of overseas Chinese in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies. It can also be seen that the achievements of the Chinese poor in developing overseas for hundreds of years. After arduous struggles, they inherited from their fathers and their sons, endured humiliation and carried heavy burdens, and finally established a solid and unshakable economic position overseas, which even the colonial powers have to admire and acknowledge!</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese in the East Indies is now not small. There are 582,000 people in Java and about 607,000 people in the outer islands, totaling about 1,189,000 people. Due to their hard work and ability to get along with the indigenous people, they have finally gained real power in agriculture, handicrafts, new industries, and local commerce. Even though the Chinese are far away overseas, what they see is no different from what they see in their home country!</p>
<p>Looking back at history, trade between China and Java existed long before the Dutch arrived in Java, at least more than a thousand years ago. Most of these overseas Chinese are only engaged in commerce near the cities, and some are engaged in agriculture and industry. They have no political conspiracies or economic monopoly attempts. Therefore, they have truly become a friendly nation in the East Indies, completely different from the aggressive British and American imperialism.</p>
<p>The population of overseas Chinese in Java ranks second only to the indigenous people and occupies the majority. The main industries they operate are food, daily necessities, gold and silver, ceramics, glass, enamel decorations, cotton cloth, bicycles, etc. They are retail merchants, and there are also those with a more solid foundation who are engaged in purchasing local products from the indigenous people and managing farms, etc. After the Greater East Asia War, when Japan completely occupied the East Indies, the handshake between the overseas Chinese and the Japanese became a reality.</p>
<p>(7) Distorted Trade Situation</p>
<p>From the perspective of the changing situation of Dutch East Indies exporters since the outbreak of World War, the United States has ranked first in the total amount of Dutch East Indies exports and imports, showing a very rapid advance, Singapore ranks second, which of course includes trade with China; the Netherlands itself has fallen to third place. (Statistical figures are based on the same source as above)</p>
<h3>To Reduce Subsistence Costs: Charity Organizations Move Inland; 500 Refugee Children Return to Suzhou and Other Places; Excellent Results Lead to Continued Implementation</h3>
<p>Five charity organizations in this city, along with approximately 500 refugee children originally housed at the former institution, have relocated to rural areas, particularly Suzhou, in the past two months, following the National Association for Child Welfare's plan to improve the living conditions of refugee children in this city. The purpose is not only to alleviate the children's anxiety caused by the rising cost of living but also to partially resolve the financial difficulties of some charity organizations.</p>
<p>Reducing Subsistence Costs</p>
<p>As prices in rural areas are lower than in Shanghai, moving refugee children to rural areas can reduce subsistence costs. Currently, the number of refugee children housed in Shanghai is around three to four thousand, so the relocation of 500 is only an initial trial measure, which will be accelerated in the future. The cost of providing for each refugee child in Shanghai is at least 200 yuan per month, while in Suzhou, 120 yuan is sufficient. Among the five charity organizations that have moved out of Shanghai, one moved to Anting, another to Dachang, and the rest to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Air Beneficial to Health</p>
<p>After the refugee children moved to rural areas, not only can savings be made in subsistence, but also the rural air and sunshine are beneficial to the children's health. It is said that one of the recently raised funds, amounting to 100,000 yuan, is gradually being used up, so efforts must be made to compensate as much as possible to cope with the ever-increasing cost of living, and the use of funds must be economized. This has necessitated the internal relocation of some charity organizations. Judging from the results, whether they are excellent or not, reports have been received from Suzhou, Dachang, and Anting directions in recent days, indicating that the children are making progress both physically and mentally. Therefore, it is planned to continue moving charitable institutions inland in the future.</p>
<h3>Trackless Trolley Causes Disaster: Two Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>Near Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road in the Public Concession, at around 4:30 PM yesterday, an eighteen-route trackless trolley traveling east to west at high speed struck two pedestrians, a mother and a child, who were crossing the road. Unable to avoid the vehicle, they were knocked to the ground, suffering fatal injuries. Xin Bingfan, 47 years old, suffered crushed chest and legs. The child, Tan Liuzi, only six years old, had his abdomen crushed by the wheels. Both died on the spot. Another child, Xin Qinfan, 12 years old, suffered minor leg abrasions. Fortunately, only the skin was injured. Subsequently, the police arrived and immediately called an ambulance, which transported the injured to the Balu Nursing Home. The bodies were sent to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Secretary KANABE Introduces German Authority's Work</h3>

<h3>Strive to Achieve Sino-Japanese Harmony and Cooperation: Mr. BANNO Expresses Aspirations</h3>
<p>The Joint Prosperity Associations for various industries, established with the goal of cultivating and preparing for decisive battles, have a total of over 500,000 participants from both Chinese and Japanese industrial combatants. They are particularly committed to promoting industrial production. The Central China Industry Joint Prosperity Federation, as the leading and promoting organization for various industry joint prosperity associations, recently appointed Mr. Kiyoshi Banno, director of the Central China Revitalization Society, as its Director of the Secretariat. Mr. Banno recently announced the following plans and aspirations for the future:</p>
<p>Since the National Government's participation in the war, the Chinese side has devoted all its efforts to promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and cultivating combat capabilities. The Japanese side is deeply impressed by this and will sincerely cooperate to assist China's work. The Central China Industry Joint Prosperity Federation is a practical movement for this. Our mission will become increasingly important. True Sino-Japanese integration lies in the integration between individuals. Chinese and Japanese people serving in the industry have created industry joint prosperity associations to promote integration between individuals. The integration of the industry will lead to the integration of the country. With Chinese and Japanese people united as one, implementing the spirit of living and dying together can promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and expand production capabilities. We plan to mobilize the unit joint prosperity associations in various parts of Central China based on the following policies to work together to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we are considering establishing liaison offices in various places to strengthen efficiency. (March 4, Mainland News)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Expansion of Our Country's Agricultural Finance Should be Led by National Banks</h3>
<p>Food is the paramount necessity of the people; therefore, all economic issues are prioritized by the grain administration. Our country is founded on agriculture, but the agricultural administration is not well-maintained, and the economic situation of farmers is becoming increasingly difficult today. According to the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), there were a total of 58,569,181 agricultural households nationwide, accounting for 74.5% of all households. If we calculate based on a national population of 400 million, then 74.5% amounts to approximately 300 million farmers. Therefore, our country's agricultural problem is directly an economic problem for 300 million people, and entirely a livelihood problem for 400 million people. Although our country has a large population, the utilization of land is very poor. According to the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government in the 21st year of the Republic, excluding Qinghai, Xikang, 10 counties in Guangxi, Xinjiang, 4 counties in Yunnan, 1 county in Heilongjiang, and 1 county in Guizhou, there were only over 124,878,000 mu of cultivated land, while the remaining barren land reached over 200 million mu. According to experts, the average person in the country has only about three mu of land, coupled with excessive taxes, frequent disasters, outdated agricultural tools, and immature farming techniques, the insufficient agricultural production is a natural result, and promoting improvement is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>To improve the agricultural economy, we should start by expanding agricultural finance. However, agricultural finance has special characteristics compared to other industrial and commercial finance, which cannot be handled or desired by general commercial financial institutions. I will first describe the characteristics and difficulties of agricultural finance as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural finance is not as cyclical as industrial and commercial finance. Commodities are easily movable, while agricultural funds used for sowing must wait until harvest time half a year or a year later to be repaid. Funds used for land improvement can take up to ten or decades of years.</p>
<p>(2) The collateral for agricultural finance is more stagnant than for commercial and industrial finance.</p>
<p>(3) The interest rate on agricultural finance cannot be raised because farmers cannot afford high interest rates. In contrast, businesses in industrial and commercial finance can afford high interest rates.</p>
<p>(4) Agricultural finance must pay extra attention to the purpose of the loan, as the nature of agricultural finance is not only in the financial relief but also in providing farmers with various kinds of guidance.</p>
<p>(5) The lending methods for agricultural finance are not as simple as those for industrial and commercial finance, so special institutions such as cooperative organizations are needed.</p>
<p>(6) Agricultural finance requires vast amounts of capital, and small amounts cannot be effective. Therefore, it cannot be organized without the power of collective strength.</p>
<p>Due to the above six characteristics, it can be seen that it is not easy to handle agricultural finance, and it is not a business that can be handled by private individuals. It cannot be achieved without the advocacy of the state. Therefore, the major countries in the world have special systems for agricultural finance, either sponsored by the state or subsidized by the government, and their nature is close to official management. Given the situation in our country, handling agricultural finance will be more difficult than in other countries, and the amount of capital needed is not difficult to imagine. According to the above-mentioned 58,569,181 agricultural households nationwide, assuming that half of the households must borrow money, and calculating 100 yuan per household per year, it would require 300 million yuan per year, which ordinary banks cannot afford. Therefore, we hope that national banks will take the lead and shoulder the heavy responsibility, and that other banks will cooperate, so that the revival of our country's agricultural economy can be expected.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Grain Administration Bureau Handles Rice Merchants' Rice Storage Registration</h3>
<p>Although Hangzhou is not a rice-producing area, Hushu on the outskirts of Hangzhou has always been the center of the rice market in Zhejiang Province. Since the Incident (likely referring to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War), the Hushu rice market has plummeted, so there has often been a shortage of food in Hangzhou. Since the Lunar New Year this year, rice prices in Hangzhou have suddenly soared, and black market transactions have become very popular. In order to suppress rice prices, the Zhejiang Provincial Food Administration Bureau issued a notice on the 26th of last month, limiting all rice shops in Hangzhou City to register all stored rice stocks before the 5th of this month. Those who hide and fail to report after the deadline will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Central China Match Company Formation Completed</h3>
<p>After the Great China Match Company was returned to our country by the Japanese military authorities, it was jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese merchants, with Chinese merchants accounting for six shares of the capital and Japanese merchants accounting for four shares. It was renamed "Central China Match Company." After the Chinese and Japanese promoters actively prepared, the various tasks have been largely completed, and No. 88 Museum Road in the city has been selected as the company's office location. It has been learned that the company held its third promoters' meeting a few days ago, and detailed decisions have been made on the company's internal organization and important positions in various departments. It is estimated that Chen Bofan was elected as the chairman of the board, Anno Yoshiichi as the vice chairman of the board, Liu Nianyi and Taguchi Takeo as the managing directors, Chen Pandong as the director, and Zhu Xuchang and Nakamura Unda as the supervisors. As for the company's internal structure, it is divided into the Secretary's Office, the General Affairs Section, the Manufacturing Section, and the Accounting Section, a total of one office and three sections. The official list of staff members is roughly half Chinese and half Japanese.</p>
<h3>China and Yongchang Stock Companies' Books Have Been Returned by the Authorities; Registration of Chinese Trading Firms Completed; The Chinese Stock Market Can Be Restored Immediately</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market has been suspended since the China and Yongchang stock companies' books were investigated by the authorities, and there is still no news of resumption of business. It has been learned that all the accounts of the China and Yongchang stock companies, which were previously investigated by the authorities, have been completely returned yesterday after a detailed investigation by the authorities, so the problem of the two stock companies can be said to have come to an end. As for the resumption of the entire Chinese stock market, the authorities are now proceeding with the registration of stock companies and issuing business licenses. Once the registration procedures are completed, Chinese stock trading can be officially restored.</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng Bank Closes Hong Kong Branch; Business Concentrated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jin Cheng Bank recently decided to close its Hong Kong branch and will organize deposit receipts and other business from the 1st to the 15th of this month in order to close the branch. In the future, the business of the Hong Kong branch will be completely concentrated in Shanghai. The Hong Kong authorities recently lifted restrictions on Chinese banks paying deposits, so this opportunity will be taken to close the branch and concentrate business at the Shanghai head office.</p>
<p>Because the Hong Kong authorities have lifted restrictions on the business of Chinese banks, perhaps one or two of the Chinese banks with head offices in Shanghai will also liquidate and close their Hong Kong branches. (March 4, Mainland News)</p>
<h3>Thai Economic Control Progresses</h3>
<p>Recently, the most noteworthy thing in the industrial and economic circles of Thailand is the progress of various controls and the strategy for revitalizing agriculture. Regarding economic controls, the Thai government promulgated various control laws after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, but they did not achieve sufficient results at first. Therefore, in mid-February, the paper-making and other control laws were re-promulgated, and the policy of government management was adopted for various important industries. In addition, in response to the sluggishness of the rice milling industry due to delayed shipments in areas affected by the previous floods, countermeasures will be taken soon. As for the export market, transportation is still an important issue. At present, shipbuilding plants have begun to build wooden giant sailing ships, which is promising. Thailand has always occupied an important position in supplying food to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it is now becoming increasingly important. The Thai government has established the "Cooperative Bank" as a financial institution for agricultural cooperatives across the country and has taken various measures to revitalize agriculture. Recently, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram inspected military conditions in various places for a month and also inspected rural villages in northern Thailand. After Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram returned to Bangkok, he summoned village chiefs from various rural villages to the capital to explain the necessity of improving agricultural affairs and revitalizing agriculture. The Thai Ministry of Agriculture also, based on the intention of Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, allocated a special budget of 2.5 million baht to construct water conservancy projects in 11 locations, including the west of the Chao Phraya River, to benefit agriculture. In addition, the Thai government has changed its past agricultural management policy, which was mainly based on rice, and is now simultaneously cultivating large quantities of soybeans, cotton, tobacco, vegetables, etc. According to the announcement of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture on February 10, the harvest of soybeans in 1940 was 124,600 dan, an increase of 21 times compared with 1939. The output of vegetables has increased by millions of dan compared with before the war. Now, not only is it no longer necessary to import from other places, but there is also a surplus. Thailand is an agricultural country, and now it is revitalizing agriculture, so it will definitely make a great contribution to the food of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

<h3>Banks' Acceptance of Bills of Exchange Discount Methods</h3>
<p>Since the silver industry promoted the acceptance of bills of exchange, the form of acceptance contract bills of exchange and the implementation plan for the discount market have been fully drafted and provided to member banks for adoption. It has also been determined in principle that the discount rate is lower than the lending rate to promote it. National banks allow the convenience of rediscounting. It is heard that China Industrial Bank and other banks, in order to promote the acceptance of bills of exchange, have announced methods for accepting acceptance of bills of exchange: (1) When merchants and factories hold bills of exchange for cashing, they should first fill out an application form. (2) If the bank considers it qualified, it should notify the applicant to complete the discount procedure. (3) The discount rate and discount limit shall be negotiated by the applicant and the bank at any time. (4) The discounted bill should be endorsed by the discounter and transferred to the bank. (5) If the bill is not paid when due, the bank may exercise recourse against any of the issuer, endorser, or guarantor. (6) After the bill is paid when due, the bank shall return the bill to the payer.</p>
<h3>Financial Affairs Inspection Office to Establish Branches in Nanjing and Suzhou</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) To stabilize finances and the market, the Ministry of Finance, after promulgating and implementing the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions" and its detailed rules, requires all existing or newly established banks, native banks, and trust companies to apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval, registration, and licensing before commencing operations. This aims to promote a sound financial industry structure. Simultaneously, to supervise financial institution operations and protect the assets of industry, commerce, and the public, the Central Reserve Bank was entrusted to establish a Financial Affairs Inspection Office in August of last year. Since September of last year, all financial institutions (such as banks, native banks, and trust companies) have been required to submit monthly statements to the office for inspection by the deadline each month. Starting the same month, financial institutions have been required to deposit no less than five percent of their fixed deposits and special current deposits as payment reserves into reserve accounts opened at the Central Reserve Bank. From January of this year, they continue to deposit half of the required ten percent or more of current deposits as reserves at the Central Reserve Bank. Since its establishment, the office has become increasingly meticulous in inspecting financial institutions throughout Shanghai, ensuring the stability of the entire financial system. It is now learned that, to promote the inspection of financial institutions in the interior, the office plans to establish branches in Nanjing and Suzhou within this month. The Central Reserve Bank has appointed Liu Ruxiang, Director of the Business Bureau of the Bank, as concurrent Director, and Cai Kan, Deputy Director of the Bureau, as concurrent Deputy Director. Chen Zhiyi, Manager of the Suzhou Branch, will concurrently serve as Director of the Suzhou Branch.</p>

<h3>A Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>— Ren Lin</p>
<p>After reading the article "Humble Suggestions for Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" in the 4th-day Shen Bao, I deeply feel that with rampant floating capital, it is necessary to adopt proactive and mandatory measures to absorb surplus purchasing power.</p>
<p>Due to the concentration of floating capital without proper outlets, it runs rampant, promoting a rapid expansion of purchasing power in society, especially an even faster expansion of surplus purchasing power. The expansion of surplus purchasing power thus fuels speculative frenzy and hoarding for profit.</p>
<p>In the past, the authorities have adopted measures such as diverting floating capital, tightening currency, cracking down on speculation, and restricting loans from banks and native banks, hoping to reduce purchasing power and stabilize floating capital. However, these are merely passive measures, and ultimately cannot achieve lasting effects. Therefore, after a temporary stabilization of floating capital, it soon finds new outlets, promoting the rise of new industries and continuing speculation and hoarding. Now, the resurgence of floating capital has further inflated surplus purchasing power, stimulating the steady rise of prices and the gradual reduction of goods, with hoarding tendencies becoming more pronounced, placing people's livelihoods under extreme pressure. Although the current surge in prices and scarcity of goods are attributed to sharp declines in production and inefficient exchanges, the mischief of surplus purchasing power cannot be denied.</p>
<p>From this, it is clear that if surplus purchasing power cannot be contracted, prices will never stabilize. However, if we continue to adopt passive measures, such as using monetary policy to suppress surplus purchasing power, the effect will be minimal, unsustainable, and ultimately a failure. We should no longer follow this path. Efforts that prove futile should be abandoned, and a new strategy should be adopted. This new strategy should be a more proactive way to absorb surplus purchasing power. Therefore, the author absolutely agrees with Mr. Hirose Kurata's proposal to use commodity treasury bonds to absorb surplus purchasing power.</p>
<p>Because the current hoarding for profit is promoting skyrocketing prices and the proliferation of black markets, it is obstructing the allocation of goods, rendering price limits useless, undermining social stability, and hindering the advancement of price policies. The resolution of this problem cannot be delayed any longer. However, this problem must be solved by adopting proactive and mandatory absorption measures.</p>
<p>Currently, various warring countries are also taking measures to absorb surplus purchasing power. However, the measures they are taking are preventive, such as compulsory savings, to absorb surplus purchasing power in society, prevent its expansion, and avoid disruptions to the wartime economy. However, in our country today, surplus purchasing power has already expanded, so future measures must not only prevent further expansion, but also absorb the already expanded surplus purchasing power. This requires measures to stop it after it has already happened, which is one point of difference that we should pay attention to. To correct what has already happened, merely adopting compulsory savings is not enough. We must further adopt commodity treasury bonds to buy up goods from speculators and hoarders, so that surplus purchasing power is absorbed, floating capital is solidified, and it can no longer cause trouble. With reduced hoarding and smoother allocation, prices can naturally stabilize, and people's livelihoods can be secured.</p>
<p>Currently, a portion of surplus purchasing power has already been transformed into commodities and has entered the path of hoarding for profit, but a portion is still floating in the market. Recent surge in bank deposits is not small. This standby demand that is floating around should also not be allowed to develop and should also be included in the absorption. Because this floating demand also has the possibility of switching to speculative hoarding at any time. In order to completely absorb the surplus purchasing power and fundamentally eliminate speculative hoarding, this floating demand must also be absorbed. For example, issuing production bonds to absorb it. Thus, floating capital can be reduced and national capital can be increased for construction, killing two birds with one stone, which should be done quickly and not ignored.</p>
<p>The above two points are only about absorbing the already expanded surplus purchasing power. Even if the rapidly expanding surplus purchasing power is completely absorbed, the re-emergence of new surplus purchasing power is still a possible and common occurrence. If this is not prevented in advance, then wouldn’t the absorption of existing surplus purchasing power be in vain? Therefore, the emergence of new surplus purchasing power should also be prevented by means such as compulsory savings.</p>
<p>The above three points, using commodity treasury bonds to buy up hoarded commodities, using production bonds to absorb floating current deposits, and compulsory savings, may be different in method, but they are consistent in absorbing surplus purchasing power. Because the forms of surplus purchasing power are not consistent, the methods of absorption cannot be the same. These three must be adopted in combination and implemented simultaneously to achieve significant results. If one is missing, it will cause more trouble and unnecessary setbacks.</p>
<p>During this absorption of surplus purchasing power, it is also necessary to supplement it with currency contraction measures, which will make the effect easier to see. Therefore, this absorption of purchasing power and currency policy should also be carried out in parallel, so that both currency and price countermeasures can be successful.</p>
<p>The rampant floating capital and the mischief of surplus purchasing power have already caused no small amount of damage. If we do not seek a thorough solution, then the mutated patterns of floating capital will know no end. Because floating capital is restless, if it is only suppressed, mutated patterns will immediately appear to circumvent this suppression and continue its mischievous activities. Therefore, today, it is necessary to adopt proactive and mandatory measures to absorb surplus purchasing power. We hope that the authorities will change their strategies, promote them as soon as possible, and correct this undesirable situation. If the above measures can be implemented immediately, it will also be of some help to the development of the national economy.</p>
<p>Economic Translations and Discussions</p>
<h3>Abolishing Extraterritoriality and the Issue of Taxation</h3>
<p>On the first of this month, the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing held a meeting to discuss the abolition of extraterritoriality and decided to implement it first in terms of taxation. This has a very important meaning for strengthening the financial resources of the National Government. The so-called abolition of extraterritoriality by Britain and the United States is just empty talk, without any practical effect. However, the Japanese side is sincere, so it first implements the part that the National Government most eagerly hopes for. What is the state of taxation of Japanese residents and people of various countries after the abolition of extraterritoriality? What effect will taxation after the abolition of extraterritoriality have on the financial resources of the National Government? Let’s give a brief overview below!</p>
<p>Current State of the National Government's Finances</p>
<p>The finances of the National Government are extremely sound. Just like what High Advisor Ishiwatari said in his speech in Shanghai last time, there was a surplus last year. The financial expenditure after the war must inevitably increase, so ways to increase revenue must be found. Currently, the fiscal revenue of the National Government is mostly from taxes, of which indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes account for about 90%, and direct taxes are a small number. However, the Ministry of Finance wants to imitate the examples of advanced countries in the world, increase the tax revenue of direct taxes, and consolidate the foundation of finances. Since returning to the capital, they have put in a lot of effort for this. Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai also expressed his opinion at the beginning of this year, saying: "The focus of the National Government's finances must be shifted from indirect taxes to direct taxes in the future." Examining this method, it existed as far back as the Qing Dynasty. At the beginning, the Qing Court decided to create a direct tax system, but it was not implemented. Later, it began to be levied in the 24th year of the Republic of China, but there was no income. It was not until the 26th year of the Republic of China that there was some, totaling about 35 million yuan, but it accounted for only about 2% of the total income. Regarding this point, the National Government is now trying its best to increase revenue, and there will inevitably be good results in the future.</p>
<p>Tax Burden After the Abolition of Extraterritoriality</p>
<p>Before the abolition of extraterritoriality, Japanese residents and people of various countries did not pay direct taxes to the National Government, but after the abolition of extraterritoriality, they naturally have the obligation to pay. In terms of indirect taxes, there is no major change. Only direct taxes have considerable changes. How the collection rate and method of direct taxes will be is currently being discussed separately by the Sino-Japanese Special Committee, and there is no specific resolution yet. However, it is widely believed that the policies of the Chinese and Japanese governments will definitely strive to avoid major changes. This point can be fully trusted by the authorities. This abolition of extraterritoriality is implemented in order to realize the lofty ideal of building a new order in East Asia. The people of China and Japan should fully understand and actively assist the government so that it can achieve its goal. Even if the tax revenue of the National Government cannot be increased immediately after the abolition of extraterritoriality, it has great significance in politics, and there are benefits both directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the Chinese people should change their past attitudes, strengthen the financial resources of their own government, and give up current small profits. They must actively assist in paying taxes. The direct taxes of any country are always assisted by the nationals. If there is no national assistance, it will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>Current Tax Collection Agencies</p>
<p>The current tax collection agencies of the National Government under the Ministry of Finance include the Tax Affairs Department, the Taxation Department, the Salt Affairs Department, the Income Tax Office, the Guangdong Financial Special Commissioner's Office, and the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Temporary Financial Reorganization Committee. There is also an organization in Xiamen.</p>
<p>Increasing tax revenue is not just about raising tax rates. It is necessary to cultivate honest tax officials, enrich its agencies, and revitalize industry, so that the power to bear taxes can be increased. These methods are expected to be implemented gradually, and adjusting the operational links between the central and local governments is also necessary. The National Government is already much more advanced in this point than before, but it is still constantly improving, which is worthy of congratulations. In the Qing Dynasty, because of the extremely decentralized financial system, the Qing Court could only directly allocate customs duties and a part of the salt tax. Recalling the above situation, compared with the appropriate and reasonable measures of the National Government, there is a truly great difference.</p>
<p>Remaining Issues</p>
<p>The remaining issues for the National Government's finances in the future are issuing public bonds and creating a monopoly system. Regarding public bonds, Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai stated that he would not issue them for the time being, and High Economic Advisor Ishiwatari also said that there was no need to issue public bonds in the first half of this year. In wartime, any country issues public bonds, because issuing public bonds is extremely effective in preventing inflation, suppressing prices, and utilizing floating capital and other financial and economic policies. After issuing public bonds, great results have been obtained in fact, so it has become a future issue for the National Government.</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether the monopoly system can be successful immediately, judging from China's social organization and the people's situation. However, among Chinese people of insight, they have studied Japan's monopoly system and want to adopt it in China. However, which commodities should be monopolized is a problem that deserves attention and research. (Translated by Ren Yunpeng from the Mainland New Daily, March 4)</p>
<p>Statistical Overview of Capital in Shanghai's Native Bank Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, floating capital has concentrated in Shanghai, and the market has experienced abnormal prosperity. Many native banks have been newly established or reorganized into company organizations with increased capital. Analyzing their capital amounts, there is a growing trend towards large capital. The average capital amount per native bank has also increased significantly compared to previous years. The following is a statistical overview:</p>

<h3>"Valuing Clothes over People"</h3>
<p>— Xie Xieshan</p>
<p>Some say: "Those who wear gorgeous clothes are upper-class people; otherwise, they are bums." Others say: "Although we ourselves do not value clothes, society is too snobbish, so we cannot but value clothes, otherwise we will be despised."</p>
<p>If these two arguments are correct, then humans are not born to be human, but merely to be clothes racks! Those who are unwilling to be clothes racks will not "value clothes over people"!</p>
<p>Only those who have nothing in their minds, do not know right from wrong, and live a life of drunken stupor will shout "valuing clothes over people." And only those who cannot be independent, echo others, and see themselves as insignificant will say: "Society is like this, and we have to be like this."</p>
<p>Wu Xun was a beggar, his clothes were tattered, but his great spirit of establishing schools, even if all the treasures of the world were gathered together, could not be compared to him. How dare one "value clothes" and despise him?</p>
<p>"One who wears a tattered robe and is not ashamed to stand with those who wear furs," can "be neutral and not lean, how strong and upright!"</p>
<h3>The Function of Recollection</h3>
<p>— Li Sisui</p>
<p>Recollection is the most beautiful and fascinating thing.</p>
<p>When life encounters a serious blow, and one loses the courage to face reality, people always like to trace back to the past, immersing themselves in the sea of recollection to numb themselves. They use self-deceiving comfort to deal with current difficulties and suppress the bitterness that has already occurred.</p>
<p>People's recollections mostly involve fragments of pleasant past lives, and rarely think of past hardships. This is also an expression of escaping reality, trying to lock oneself in an ivory tower. Just like wanting to turn back time, and wanting to grab one's hair to make oneself rise, it is clearly a self-deceiving illusion. However, why are there so many willing to be slaves to illusions?</p>
<p>If one could target difficulties, solve bitterness, and live stubbornly and stubbornly without compromise in the past, at least there would be no pessimistic or disappointing emotions today; and one would not even think of escaping when encountering difficulties and bitterness. Then, how can today's life not be the future's past! Do we hope that future life will be even more troublesome? Strictly speaking, this is a form of mental suicide. It will make us produce the so-called seeing through the world, and living a carefree life.</p>
<p>In fact, disappointment and negativity are not necessarily the only children of recollection: on the contrary, it can become a factor in enhancing self-confidence, if we can experience experience and lessons from past successes and failures, and are willing to use them in a coherent way in the current struggle of life. The acquisition of experience and lessons cannot be based on a simple and intuitive understanding of the facts. Instead, it is necessary to trace back to how difficulties were estimated at that time, and the countermeasures at that time, the tenacity of the execution process, and thus the resulting results. All are analyzed and synthesized, repeatedly studied, so that we can draw conclusions and understand the reasons and lessons of this gain and loss. Then apply it in the next struggle of life. Only by constantly taking out and applying experience and lessons can it be true, not bookish!</p>
<p>Many people have never known this set of principles, but in real life, not only are they not good at using recollection, but they are enslaved by it. Occasionally, they will make a refreshing attempt, but after being unable to withstand repeated blows, they will return to their previous pessimism and arbitrary attitude; or they will simply become pure intuitive empiricists. Are these people fatefully slaves to the past? No, the question is whether they have an active life goal for their future. If they can value their future and hope that their goals can be achieved sooner, they will naturally be extremely human in their use of time. The function of recollection is important!</p>
<h3>More on the Issue of Friends</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, to commemorate the March 3rd Friends Festival, I published an article in this newspaper, "Several Issues on Friends," but the meaning was not exhausted, so I thought of two more practical issues:</p>
<p>(1) No Age Limit</p>
<p>"Respect the old in my family, so that they will respect the old in other families; cherish the young in my family, so that they will cherish the young in other families." This is the great spirit of human benevolence. Speaking of friends, there should be no distinction between old and young, but due to differences in age, habits of thought, etc., there is often a situation of "a few words are too many for those who do not agree," or even an attitude of mutual discrimination. In fact, this is absolutely unnecessary, because the elderly grew up from youth, and the young will also reach old age. Then, if everyone's mind is broadened, what irreconcilable point is there in the spirit of friendship? Elderly friends have more experience and knowledge, and young friends should accept the good views of elderly friends with a fair and judgmental mind. If they are all dismissed, not only will they lose the beauty of "respecting the old," but they will also not choose good words, which will be detrimental to their own conduct in life. As for the elderly friends, do not rely on the old to sell the old," thinking that "youngsters are not worth mentioning." Know that treating young friends with this attitude will instead be despised and make people dare not approach. I think the most important thing is that young friends can recognize valuable experience in elderly friends and accept well-intentioned guidance, while elderly friends can use a caring spirit for sincere young friends, treating them like children, and patiently teaching them in order to "surpass the blue." Therefore, young friends should "respect the old," and elderly friends should set a good example.</p>
<p>(2) Silver and Money Relationship</p>
<p>A gentleman has the beauty of helping others, and friends have the righteousness of sharing wealth. Money itself is a circulating thing, and due to "artificial" relationships, it can play many roles. Many friends with close friendships have broken up due to money relationships. This is probably mostly due to unclear exchanges, and the concept of being snobbish and having snobbish behavior due to money is really a very bad situation among friends. I think money may be shared, but the procedures must be clear. This is a matter of credit. Because once credit goes bankrupt, friends will not dare to believe, and you can forget about friends helping in the future. On the other hand, if you only value money too much and disregard friendship, it is really not the way of friends. Everyone should not combine friendships because of money, nor should they break friendships because of money.</p>
<h3>Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Wenzhao</p>
<p>When you are in poverty and frustration, when you are down and out, perhaps you will feel disappointed in yourself and feel your own insignificance. But if you are still a spiritual person, you should quickly strengthen your self-confidence - only trusting yourself is the only way to save you from poverty!</p>
<p>It is perhaps most appropriate to use the foundation of building a house to metaphor self-confidence: have you ever seen masons build houses? Before starting to build walls, they must first lay a solid foundation underground. The deeper they are laid, the higher the house can be built. If you want to make your future career as high as a house, you must first lay a strong and deep foundation in your heart, firmly trusting yourself.</p>
<p>An excellent craftsman must also consider the environment when laying the foundation. He knows that a crooked and uneven foundation will make the future house lose its beauty and solidity. He also knows that if the boundary of the foundation encroaches on other people's land, the house built will cause damage to others; of course, if you are confident that you can become a bandit leader, this kind of self-confidence will definitely not make your future house solid and stable.</p>
<p>With only the foundation, without adding walls, the house will never be completed: or, with the foundation already laid, in order to complete the skyscraper as soon as possible, one disdains to deliberately build bricks, so that the walls are cut corners, imagine that the work is completed under such rough and shoddy workmanship, how can one not follow the reckless and destructive path! On the basis of self-confidence, you must also do it step by step carefully, each step is like adding a brick, which can make the walls higher and the foundation more solid.</p>
<p>Without accurate and strong self-confidence, without the hard work and unremitting struggle, no great career will be achieved, just like in a desolate open space, without laying the foundation, it will always be a desolate open space, and no tall house will ever stand in the future.</p>
<p>Stop wandering in the desolate open space in front of you and envying the tall buildings of others! And stop thinking that tall buildings cannot be built on desolate open spaces! To get yourself away from the current state of poverty as soon as possible, quickly strengthen your self-confidence, work hard to fight, lay your foundation to build a house. Who can not encounter setbacks on the road of life? Your current poverty is inevitably due to your previous lack of trust in yourself. Strengthening your self-confidence one day earlier can relieve you of your current predicament one day earlier, and can also complete your skyscraper one day earlier to accommodate yourself and others.</p>
<h3>Earning Money and Using Money</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Yu</p>
<p>People cannot live without a day, and they cannot live without money for a day. Especially in Shanghai, where capitalism is extremely strong, the relationship between people and money is even closer. The so-called "a penny can kill a hero," is truly a picture of the Shanghai society where human feelings are weak.</p>
<p>I have time to think that if you distinguish these millions of citizens from the relationship of money, there are no more than four types of people: the first type of people earn less and spend less, they are all peaceful low-salary classes, because they all get a small amount of money by sweating, so most of them can be diligent and thrifty, and very economical. The second type of people earn more and spend less, they are mostly small bourgeoisie who came from frugality, relying on the opportunity, prices rise again and again, and their assets are increasing day by day, and they are very stingy with spending money, they are absolute misers, and they would not pluck a hair to benefit the world. The third type of people earn less and spend more, they are mostly prodigal sons, who do not know the difficulty of material resources, and spend wastefully. As a result, they cannot make ends meet, and all kinds of fraudulent theft have to be done. These people are destroyers of social security and blood-sucking profiteering merchants, and they are equally enemies of the citizens. The fourth type of people earn more and spend more, these people are mostly rich merchants or people with special power, they earn money easily, so they spend money casually, spending thousands of gold coins without stinginess, they are generous customers in the places of pleasure. So-called ill-gotten gains go ill-spent.</p>
<p>As for the value of using money, it does not lie in the amount of money, but in whether the use is proper or not? In this Great East Asia War period, you should be more careful, like relieving refugees, supporting the old and helping the poor, donating to help schools, etc., are all the avenues of using money. Transform the concept of the small self into the big self, and change the psychology of pleasure into hardship. When it should not be used, even a penny should not be used, when it should be used, even tens of millions should not be stingy, this is the master of money. Otherwise, why bother being a slave to money?</p>

<p>— Tianming Zuo</p>
<h3>On Friendship</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhaoxiong</p>
<p>I am already a man past thirty. On life's journey, I no longer have the desire for playful jesting and lighthearted fun, nor do I want to blindly join in the raucous crowds. Moreover, my personality has always been somewhat serious. I always feel that once a person reaches middle age, it is like walking quickly in the rain, unable to return to the joy of spring travel in youth. This is also an unavoidable state of mind. Since last year, I have felt even more desolate, because the death of my brother and younger brother has added such a wound to me, truly like a cut or a tear! I myself seem to be walking with an umbrella, further deepening my shadow! Facing my solitary figure, I cannot help but feel sorrow! Thinking of the sudden departure of relatives and friends, and the loneliness of life, I truly do not know how to ignite passion. For the sake of my brother's desolate situation after his death, I have striven to solicit contributions for his funeral expenses, and I have finally achieved my wish. In this world, I have found some passion. Although I am in extreme grief, obtaining this passion is like seeing light, and I cannot help but be moved to the extreme! Old friends like Qiu Tingfang and Shi Daqing have expressed deep sympathy, which makes me feel all the more grateful! Recently, reading Shao Xiqiao's compilation of "Surviving Letters of Teachers and Friends", there are seven letters from Wang Xizhuang, and the last one contains a passage that says: "Because I think about it, when a person is young and first comes out into the world to make friends, they do not cherish friends very much. But when they have traveled half the world, and look back on old friends, they truly feel their flavor is deep and long-lasting. Because the ups and downs, the prominence and obscurity, the gatherings and separations, pass by in the blink of an eye, as if separated by lifetimes. In this extremely empty and illusory world, things fall apart and scatter. By chance, a few old friends remain in the world; these old things, how can one not miss them! Moreover, the feelings of these old friends are ten times deeper than those of new friends?" These words, I have learned, are quite meaningful, and they can express the feelings of someone who has experienced the world after middle age. They truly have the feeling of "In youth, one does not know the taste of sorrow," and "Now I know the taste of sorrow." This word "sorrow" perfectly explains the difficulties of human life. The more one understands the difficulties of human life, the more one feels the preciousness of friendship. The foundation of friendship should be built on shared difficulties. The worldly wine-and-meat friends share joy but not hardship, because their foundation is built on shifting sands. I remember a certain writer saying: "I think among the Five Relationships, the righteousness of friends is the highest." This is indeed a true and insightful saying. Because the remaining ethical relationships are mostly maintained by status, by benefit, and less by affection and righteousness. Only the righteousness of friends is purely spiritual. Therefore, there are often disputes between families, but few betrayals of righteous friendships. If one could also incorporate the righteousness of friendship between father and son, and husband and wife, then there would be fewer cases of turning against each other and violating ethical principles. Therefore, friendship is not only the most honorable, but also the most expansive affinity. Extending this to politics, economics, and international affairs, if one can everywhere inspire each other with sincere and simple friendship, this world would not be as desolate as it is now!</p>
<p>Since last year, due to the death of my brother and younger brother, I have been extremely grieved. However, I think of my surroundings, where I can still find friendship. Then, as long as I closely connect with existing friendships, and expand new friendships, it is also the best way to compensate for the lack in my heart. In a rush of gratitude, I write this to express my sorrowful thoughts!</p>
<h3>Catching Up</h3>
<p>— Yue Hao</p>
<p>The method of learning obviously changes with the environment and the goal. In the imperial examination era, in order to win a title of "Juren" or "Jinshi," who could escape the threshold of classics, philosophical writings, eight-legged essays, and parallel prose? Ten years under the window was nothing but rote memorization, recitation, imitation, and practice. The entire time was spent burying oneself in the pile of books. Once you became famous, even if you wrote books and discourses, you could not escape the trick of rehashing old ideas, quibbling over the explanation of each word and meaning, and attacking each other's sects and factions. As for the improvement of the entire social system and the application of scientific civilization, it was uniquely left unconsidered. Although the outside world has already changed its face, we still stubbornly adhere to the old ways, using the ancient culture of three or four thousand years ago as the norm for our present lives. As a result, those who chant about the wind and moon and elegant scholars are as numerous as carps crossing the river, and those who engage in high-flown discussions are everywhere, great strategists who plan strategies and make decisions a thousand miles away. They place unlimited faith in empty illusions like floating clouds. The Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi, with a piece of talisman to retreat ten thousand troops, and the violent explosive of can not be cited as the talk of the past, an unprecedented humiliation!</p>
<p>The times are like a giant fire wheel, constantly advancing and constantly spewing out strange brilliance. The universe, which was once considered mysterious, has been excavated for its secrets and put to our use. The great nature has lost its comprehensive control. With our intelligence, perseverance, struggle, and exploration, we have partially dissected it. The various profound studies and discoveries of astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, etc., after the nineteenth century, have completely changed into another world. It is no longer only built on spiritual civilization, but also complements material civilization. Newton's laws of motion were only the beginning. Watt's steam engine and Darwin's theory of eugenics have transformed a serene and purely aesthetic world into a stage for intense competition. In recent times, the discovery of radioactive substances and the successive establishment of quantum theory and wave theory have gradually revealed what was once considered the greatest and most profound mystery. Of course, this is only a very small exploration. The overall exposure is still a considerable distance away. But such a change is no longer fully adaptable to our ancient culture. We have walked to the edge of the volcano. If you cannot grasp yourself and recognize yourself, you will be melted by it. It will never allow you to be leisurely and carefree. There is only a verdict of either advancing or retreating. Although whether this is reasonable for the value of life, and whether material civilization brings you pain or happiness—will be discussed later, the rapid change of the times does not allow you to hesitate. We must change a goal, boldly and publicly absorb other people's culture as much as possible, and no longer confine ourselves to our very small garden. This is not to despise our own ancient civilization, but to have a change, some enrichment, so that it can be further developed and flourish. In the new trend, it is not destruction, but rebirth. Now it is facing the juncture of life and death, the edge of progress and degradation. If you are unwilling to fall behind, you must make a complete adjustment to the way of learning, work hard in a down-to-earth manner, rather than perfunctorily in a refined manner, practical rather than purely theoretical, and catch up with the times head-on!</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>"I told you not to eat ham and eggs, but you insist on eating ham and eggs!" The voice of a boy of about ten years old, full of anger, followed after a loud bang and was transmitted over, which made people feel very harmonious, just like a torrential rain immediately after a thunderclap. "You pigs! Thieves! Bitches!..."</p>
<p>"Alas, there's really no way." Huang Chong'an listened for a while, shook his head on the kang bed, and hurriedly picked up the water pipe on the kang table to fill it with tobacco, comforting himself.</p>
<p>"Chongweng, don't get angry," Yang Zijie across from him grinned, showing his mustache and kindly comforted him, "Your nephew is still young, when he grows up, I'm afraid not..."</p>
<p>Genming and Yu Duzhou both stared wide-eyed and listened, although it was not the first time they had heard it, but now that their father was listening, they always felt a strange feeling.</p>
<p>"The little devil loses his temper all day long." Third Uncle smiled back, a gold tooth flashed in the light of the safety lamp, reflecting his unusually pale face, which could not help but make Yu Duzhou remember the words "graceful young man."</p>
<p>"Child, it's really cold, I can't buy live crucian carp..." An elderly woman was persuading in a loving and peaceful tone.</p>
<p>"I don't care! I don't care!..." The roar continued.</p>
<p>"Qian Ma, why don't you think of a way? We have live crucian carp every day in our place." A middle-aged woman said along.</p>
<p>"Since Miss has it in her place, why don't you bring a few?" Qian Ma's cold voice.</p>
<p>"You didn't ask me to, how would I know! Even if you asked me, should I work for you!" She retorted angrily.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the same as saying nothing!" Not convinced. "Qian Ma, you..."</p>
<p>Their argument continued.</p>
<p>"Ew, ew, I don't want to eat, I don't want to eat!..." Crying came.</p>
<p>Crying, arguing, and persuasion, passed through a small patio from the opposite room and were clearly sent into the study, and later became more intense. It was of course impossible for the people in the study not to hear it, and it was even more impossible to talk themselves. (Four)</p>
<h3>Methods of Seeking "Joy" by Eliminating "Suffering" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zui Shi</p>
<p>A Record of a Symposium at a University Luncheon</p>
<p>"Compare upwards for work and obligations, compare downwards for enjoyment and rights," is the method to relieve the "pain of comparison" and generate the "joy of comparison." We should compare our own work and obligations with those who have heavier burdens than us, and with times when the burdens were heavier than now. For example, there are often people who work ten hours a day, and when they see others only working six hours a day, but with more rewards, they often complain bitterly, shouting: "My working hours are too long! The rewards are too meager!" Suppose he is willing to shift his gaze and look at the workers who work more than twelve hours a day, even sixteen hours, and whose income is not enough to provide for their own basic needs, they will surely rejoice that their own working hours are still short! The rewards are still generous!</p>
<p>"We should compare our enjoyment and rights to those who are less fortunate than us, and to times when they were less fortunate than now. For example, if we compare our current clothing, food, and housing with the past, we will feel uncomfortable and painful. Suppose we often recall the indescribable suffering we experienced during the past times of fleeing disasters, we will feel that our current life is still stable and does not feel bitter.</p>
<p>"In short, the 'encounter' itself has no such thing as pain and joy. It can indeed make people feel pain, and it can also make people feel joy. It all depends on how we think. For the same encounter, thinking this way will make you feel pain, and thinking that way will make you feel joy. We only need to think about our 'encounter' with a thought that is sufficient to produce joy, and we will naturally be happy.</p>
<p>"Establishing more hopes that can be realized, and working harder for the hopes that have been established" is the method to relieve the "pain of disappointment" and generate the "joy of hope." In the journey of life, if we do not establish "hope" often, then becoming "hopeless" will naturally have less fun to speak of. But the hopes we establish should have the possibility of being realized; otherwise, that is not a kind of "hope", only a kind of "delusion" that can never be realized. With the hope that can be realized, you still have to work hard constantly to make the time for the "hope" to be realized closer and closer day by day. In this way, happiness can increase day by day. If you have hope but don't work hard, in the end, you will inevitably feel disappointed and feel pain. Even if you succeed, it is just by luck. The most appropriate example to illustrate this connection is playing mahjong. When we play mahjong, there are possible, continuous "hopes", plus continuous "efforts", and the hope will continue to be realized. When we pick up a hand of cards, we already have a hope of wanting to "win", so we "discard" the cards we don't want, and "draw", "eat", and "pong" the cards we want. These actions of "discarding", "drawing", "eating" and "ponging" are the "efforts" to make the hope of "winning" gradually approach realization. If the result is that someone else "wins", you should be "disappointed", but because the second hand of cards has been picked up, hope has come again. Although "disappointed", but not "desperate", so you don't feel pain, so you "work hard" again, and as a result, you "win", then how happy you are! Such endless cycles can immerse mahjong players in an atmosphere of joy, no wonder most people like to play mahjong. We often feel that life is too ordinary and boring when we are free. This feeling is a reflection of our lack of hopes that can be realized. If we encounter this situation, quickly use our brains and quickly find ways to establish various hopes that can be realized, and then go all out to realize the hopes that we have established. I dare to guarantee that in the process of "effort", there is infinite joy to be enjoyed"!</p>

<p>An Appeal from a Person Suffering from Hardship</p>
<p>I am a seventeen-year-old youth. Last April, I entered a medium-sized towel factory to work. Although life was hard (sleeping less than six hours a day), my spirit was still happy. Unexpectedly, the factory suspended work due to transportation reasons last summer, and the branch factory staff took the opportunity to dismiss me. Recently, the head factory has been exerting extreme pressure on me. If I do not comply with one thing, I will be reprimanded. The intention is to make me resign voluntarily, otherwise I will be dismissed on some pretext. I am in this abyss of suffering and eagerly hope that people in society will lend a helping hand. No matter how hard the work is, I am happy to do it, and I have a suitable guarantor. Both interview and written test are acceptable. Jin Weiguo, correspondence address: Tang Ruoyun, c/o Kaili Company, No. 761, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
