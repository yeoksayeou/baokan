<h3>戰時生產合理化</h3>
<p>連日討論發展戰時生產，我們希望能夠喚起中日關係當局生大小企業家的注意；不過，我們還庶特別喚起大家注意的是一切戰時生產必須做到合理化的地步，才能更有效地增加戰時生產。</p>
<p>所謂戰時生產合理化，就是戰時一切生產事業之合理的配合。障碍着產量的增加和穩定。現在姑且拋開政治的障碍不說，只購技術方面，第一，由於過分的依賴天時氣候，這當然須從水利和農林設法。講到水利，不外開渠·築壩·造閘·建堤·　井·蓄水·引水等，所有這些都需要工業方面的製造供應。第二，是土壤的培養，就是肥料問題。目前農業方面對於肥料的需要極爲殷切，國外供應，幾乎已經沒有，而國內肥料工業簡直貧乏得很，不論磷質·氮質·硫質·石灰質的肥料，都不能幫助農業來解決肥料問題。其實，日本是者名出產肥料的國家，而滿洲的豆餅尤爲中國（特別是江浙一帶）過去農田施肥的主要來源，在這東亞軸心加緊進展之際，似應在這一方面有所表現。第三，是人力獸力的不够。參戰以後，農村人力獸力的合理分配問題，自然更加值得重視和考慮的了。這個動力的困難，只有在技術上多多應用機械的力量，使耕犁·播種·收割·春碾·戽水·都儘量利用機械，以適應今後農村勞動力缺乏的現實問題。　三點如果工業界能全部做到，農業的生產即可相當的樂觀，即使不能完全做到，部份的做到，並不是小可能的。但關於這些，就靠今後農工兩界多多述絡，以謀配合。因爲在另一方面，農業生產的增進也應適合工業的需要。例如生產液體燃料所需的糖蜜（由甘蔗製造），桐油·菜油·今後爲了參戰，其需要必更增加，所待農業生產之供應，可謂十分殷切，又如紡織所需的棉花·蔴·在供給方面也佔很重要地位，都期待於戰時農業之有組織有計劃的和工業相配合。</p>
<p>其次，是鑛業和工業的配合。如果工業所需的原料，燃料，不能獲得鑛業方面的充分供給，則工業必小能儘量提高生產，有時就不免全部或局部停工，或减少工作時間，减少產量。最明顯的是燃料—煤。這一方面是產量足够與否的問題，另方面還有分配合理與公平與吾的問題。特別是對於資力薄弱的工廠，如不給予扶助，就不能不因此影響生產。至如治煉工業所需的原料，如鐵·銅·錳·鋅等，也都依賴於鑛業之合理的供應。鐵是製鋼的重要原料，而鋼銅這類精鍊的余屬，正是工業和兵工業需要最大的原料，在參戰以後，需要自然更爲增加了，而需要鑛業與工業之配合的程度也提高了。以上是說工業有待於鑛業配合之處。相反的，鑛業也有待於工業之密切配合。譬如鑛業方面所需的鑽鑿，碾磨，以及冶煉，通風，動力，交通，修理，建築等方面的設備，都需要工業方面的供應，因爲假如這種供應不合理，不充分，那麼，礦業設備之擴充和生產之增加就要遭遇莫大的困難了。</p>
<p>動力和工業，也要求着密切的配合。很多工業，不能獲得充分的動力，因而不能擴充設備，增加生產，甚至新工廠的設立，不得不遷就動力之供應。這種現象不僅在小城市爲然，即大都市也不免如此。動力不够，更加妨害了生產。可是，也有些地方，會發生動力過剩的現象，這是因爲電廠的設備，超過了當地的動力消費量。從另一方面說，動力方面，也有待於工業之配合，如電業所需的發電機，透平變壓器，電綫，絕緣品，柴油發電機所需柴油等，如果得不到工業方面的充分供應，則電業的生產和擴充以及新電廠的設立，都有很大的困難。</p>
<p>工業與工業之間，更需要配合。製造電綫的工廠需要精銅，製造無綫電器材的工廠和較大的製造機器的工廠，需要工業品原料，煉鋼的工廠需要鐵等等，都必須各工業之相互配合，吾則，便難望生產的增加。而且工業界中，尤其是中日工業間，大工業與中小工業間的排擠，傾軋，等等不良現象，大魚吃小魚的陰謀，有時也不能盡免，當然更談不到配合。今後是再也不能不改善的了。</p>
<p>此外，還有金融不能配合工業，以致工業資金的週轉十分困難，交通不能配合工業，以致工業的建設，原料品的供應，都遭遇極大的困難。而農林·鑛·工業·金融·交通等業相互間的不能配合，其影響之鉅大而嚴重，也是一樣的。凡此一切，都希望中日當局以大公無私的精神，在戰時需要與戰後發展兼籌並顧的前提之下，實行最完備約計劃生產，將和平區內的一切生產事業，完全包括在內，同時並須就現有許多經濟機構中選擇其一，或另設戰時經濟機構，賦與全權，集中人才，負責生產事業的計劃·調整·配合。原有各經濟與生產事業的主管機關，以及重要的生產事業，應經常保持密切連絡，開誠交換意見，檢討得失，均以國家民族的利益爲前提，力謀有效的合作。這樣，生產事業才得納入正軌，充分發展，發揮最大功能，協力爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，穩定和平區內的經濟與國民生活。</p>

<h3>五中全會宣言</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　中國國民黨第六屆中央執行委員會第五次全體會議宣言如下、本黨總理孫先生於十三年十一月北上之際、繞道神戶、講演大亞洲主義、此爲三民主義殿後之演講，亦即總理生平最後之演講、其明年三月總理逝世於北平、臨終遺囑、諄諄以廢除不平等條約期諸後死同志、自是以來、荏苒十七八年矣、中間中日兩國、不幸發生糾紛、馴至兵連禍結、爲英美侵略主義者所快、爲東亞同志所痛、直至今日、中華民國始得回復大亞洲主義之本來面目、協力友邦日本參加大東亞戰爭、驅除東亞之敵人、英美侵略主義者、團結十萬萬東亞同胞、以爲東亞同志、爭取大東亞戰爭之勝利、謀大東亞共榮建設之實現、而友邦日本、亦於此際援助中華民國、廢除不平等條約、交還租界、撤廢治外法權、以完成中華民國獨立自主所必須具備之條件、嗚呼、總理之遣志、四萬萬同胞多年之熱望、一旦而償、本黨同人、於第五次中央全體會議開會之際、獲見此劃時代的進展追懷往事、誠不禁且悲且喜、而瞻望前途、尤具有無限之興奮、</p>
<p>本黨自第六次全國代表大會以來揭舉和平之要義、有日　中國若不能得到平等自由、則無分担東亞責任之能力而中國平等自由之完全獲得、必於東亞解放中求之、故在和平運動聞始之際即根據大亞洲主義、以響應友邦日本建設東亞新秩序之主張、蓋所謂和平當爲眞正永久合於正義之和平、旣非戰後疲敝苟求休息所能假借名義、亦非拘囿於狹隘的國家主義、但謀本身的復興所能達到目的、循此要義、遞演迭進、自中日基本關係條約成立、三國共同宣首發布、而軸心結成、自大東亞戰爭發動之始、國民政府有同甘共苦之聲明、而趨向決定、由此更進一步、以參加大東亞戰爭、實爲當然之步驟、亦即最後之決心也、全國同胞、在此大時代中、應竭其能力抵之於成、而吾黨同志、允當將於使命之偉大、責任之獨重、犧牲一切、以貢獻大東亞戰爭、庶幾因大東亞戰爭之最後勝利、而中國得到自由、東亞得到解放、茲舉數事爲吾黨同志告、</p>
<p>第一、東亞聯盟運動與新國民運動、智爲吾黨同志所發起、一則重在對外之團結、一則重在對內之革新、要皆根源於同一之出發點、以期達到共同之歸趨、當茲進入於參戰時期、凡我同志、當知東亞聯盟爲大東亞共榮建設之理想的機構、而新國民運動則爲中國取得分担大東亞共榮建設之資格所必具之條件、允宜本先之勞之的精神、以身作則、爲國民之領導、凡我同志、當知「以身敎者從」之義、新國民運動綱領之實施、不繫於言而繫於行、「知之非艱、行之維艱」、總理曾痛辯其非、「行之維艱」則凡我同志皆宜共凛、</p>
<p>第二、友邦日本、當大東亞戰爭發起之初、以獨力担任最前綫、使英美侵略勢力、歸於粉碎、中國疲敝之餘、所能協力於大東亞戰爭者幾何、此本黨同志所宜深念者也、然而友邦日本、不惟贊成中國之參戰、且於中國參戰之際、不惜予以援助、使能自力以躋於獨立自主之域者、無他、欲團結大東亞十萬萬民衆、以爭取大東亞戰事之最後勝利、俾東亞共榮建設、臻於實現而已、中國於此、惟有本同甘共苦同生共死之旨、而力行之、惟共同甘共苦、乃能苦盡甘來、惟其同生共死、乃能死中得生自今以後、中日關係益加親密、滿泰兩國爲東亞共榮之共同建設者、德義諸邦爲世界新秩序之共同創造者、最近義國與日本取同一步驟援助中國、退還租界及撤廢治外法權、凡我同志、對於此種深厚之友誼、慷慨之義舉、惟應加倍努力、以期東亞軸心及世界軸心之鞏固、</p>
<p>第三、百年以來、英美勢力深中於人心、蓋不惟政治上軍事上經濟上之壓迫及榨取而已、文化上之麻醉作用、爲毒尤烈、爲害允大、中國之參戰、不備在形述上掃除英美之橫暴勢力、尤在心理上受英美之麻醉作用、根本拔除之、凡我同志、宜本「攻心爲上」之格　、使分裂東亞者一切挑撥離間之謀、無自而施、然後東亞之團結可保、</p>
<p>第四、以上三點、就原則上立論、至於具體方法、則宜取軍點主義、大東亞戰爭之意義、應使之普及化、深刻化、生產力應增加、應使一切生產份子、有再生產之餘裕、治安保障、應使之加强、此爲行政及經濟政策之最大方針、亦卽律軍之最大目的、凡我同志、首集中精力於此、庶幾心力物力、無虞浪費、</p>
<p>第五、重慶方面少數份子、執迷不悟、固矣、然大多數人、則仍停滯於徘徊觀望之途中、凡我同志、對於執迷不悟之少數分子、不宜再存姑息、然對於大多數則宜洞察其癥結所在、努力樹立和平之模範、東亞共榮之模範、使之對我方增加信仰、則其內部之幡然而改、必可計日而俟也、促進全面和平之大道、端在於此、</p>
<p>以上五點、舉要　之、凡我同志、欲求實踐、則宜先檢察本身之組織力、及訓練力、尤宜檢察內心、夫內心之純潔、勇氣所由生也勇氣之百折不撓、精神以愈用而愈出、智慧以愈濬而愈瑩、大功所由成也、政治之良窳、於黨務之緊張及懈弛決之、黨務之臧吾、於內心之純潔與吾決之、今日之事、非舉全國最純潔最精誠之心力以貢獻於國家、民族決不能使之由危而安、由亡而存、而全國之心力、其引導之鼓舞之者、惟在吾黨、凡我同志、關係大矣、責任重矣、中華民國由吾黨本身而斬　、抑由吾黨本身而得救乎、中華民國能盡其東亞一份子之責任、與東亞同其安危乎、抑將自外於東亞乎、一言以蔽之、視吾黨之努力如何而已、總理在天之靈、實式憑之、凡我同志、勉之毋忽、</p>
<h3>周副院長昨晚廣播　「關於中國參戰問題的釋疑」</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　行政院周副院長、於十五日晚、在京廣播、題爲「關於中國參戰問題的釋疑、」其要旨如下、國民政府已經在本月九日、對英美宜戰了、全國同胞、都應該一心一德、矢勤矢勇、和友邦協力、爭取最後的勝利、不過據我所知道、有一部分人士、對於中國參戰、還有不少的懷疑和誤會、我現在一一舉出來加以說明和解釋、第一、有人以爲中國參戰是受友邦日本所逼迫、不得不實行的、這個推測、完全錯誤、第二、有人以爲中國如果參戰、負担就要更重、人民就要更苦、這也是不察事實、不明利害的妄談、如果不能以交戰國的地位、享受戰勝國的收獲、同時還是一樣的要負担、一樣的要痛苦、我們爲的是甚麼所以參戰、於中國是絕對有利的、第三、有人以爲英美將來一定打勝仗、我們何必捲入　渦、將來也隨着敗亡呢、這個議論、更加不對、英美能够打勝仗嗎、我敢斷言他們沒有這種把握、就軍事說、太平洋的軍略要點、都　友軍佔領了、就資源說、美國素以自豪的汽油、在東亞共榮圈已經有了很豐富的米源、同時美國向來仰給於東亞共榮圈的橡皮錫等軍需資源、現在已經不能冉向美國輸入了、所以英美的最後勝利、是絕對沒有把握的、我們怕甚麼、第四、有人以爲中國如果參戰、日本會借着共同作戰爲名、對中國的主權行使、加以很大的束縛和限制、這完全是抹煞事實的杞憂、第五、有人以爲和平運動的目的、在求全面和平、如果中國參戰、不是關了全面和平之門嗎、這種議論、實在非常淺薄我們要實現全面和平、只有一個辦法、就是加快的打倒英美、打倒束縛重慶不許他從事全面和平的英美、第六、有人以爲日本如果得了勝利、中國更要不得了、我們何必參戰去協助他得到勝利呢、對於這個懷疑、分兩點答覆、（一）日本並沒有要求中國參戰、是中國自動的參戰的、這足以證明日本早有單獨作戰以獲得勝利的準備、（二）日本得到最後的完全勝利、於中國只有利、決不會有害、第七、有人以爲參戰以後、要抽壯丁、要限制提存、經濟統制更要加嚴、生產更要萎靡、這些顧慮也造不必要的、以上對於各種懷疑的心理和議論、都一一的予以解釋了、我所說的話、決沒有一點點强詞奪理、完全是根據事實立論、對於參戰旣然沒有一點可以疑慮之處、大家就要有力出力、萬衆一心、衆志成城、以全力去完成最後的勝利、英美肆言今年爲反攻年、我們拿事實來粉碎他們反攻的迷夢、</p>

<h3>甯夏行（續完）　西北高原荒涼寂寞　賀蘭山麓田壠青青</h3>
<p>轉入坦途</p>
<p>離開同心城之後，公路比較平坦好走，車行於兩山之間的一個荒原上，不見有已經開墾的土地，荒原上只長着一叢一叢的草，凡有叢草的地方，比較的高，使得平原上像癩　似的，山色至此變爲鐵靑，凹凸多稜角，顯示土質和前面已經有點不同。不見有樹，也不見有水，直至中寗縣城附近，才見到綠樹長在村落的旁邊，　了葉的枸杞樹像培養樹苗一樣的栽在田地裏，通濟渠的流水也見到了，中寗城外的景像倒有點像西安的郊外，可是城內並不熱鬧，縣政府已派人在城門口迎接我們，並把我們送到兩家飯館吃早飯。枸杞是此地的特產，街上也有人負着買，據說八十元可以買到一升，吃飯過後，便離了中寗。公路旁邊的幼樹都用了土磚砌成兩尺多高的　欄，加以保護，足見地方對於公路樹木的培植。煞費苦心，沿路上都可看到人家的旁邊，栽着枸杞的樹圃，樹的形狀，似有點像小的虬松。遇着的羊羣較以前更多。汽取過處，小羊兒都驚顧奔走，肥壯的身軀顯得步武蹣跚。</p>
<p>抵甯夏境</p>
<p>下午三點多鐘，抵寗夏境內的第一個縣同心城，距中寗遠有七十九公里，不容易於當天趕到，故決心在同心城憇下。這是一個太荒凉的城市，沒有城牆，僅僅只有一條大街，所謂大街也够凉落的，似乎沒有見到一個賣布匹的南店，當汽車停下的時候，一大羣蓄鬍子　沒面皮襖的大漢都好奇的圍隴來，門縫裏則有婦女在偷着瞧。我們一直投到「寗夏省政府」的招待所去，因爲除了投那兒外，決再找不到住所。在招待所我們雖只得到幾間有十坑的空房，却受到招待所的殷勤招待，從他們的談話裏，得知該城又叫做半城子，因爲很久以前地震陷沒了半個城，現在全縣共僅三萬七千多人，城裏面只有二千多人，回民佔總數的白分之九十以上。淸眞寺也有五個之多，更屬他們領導，我們去參觀了一二個淸眞寺，一個是舊派的寺，一是新派的寺。據說還有一個新新派。兩寺都相常宏　壯麗，在那樣荒凉貧苦的地方，而有那樣相常漂亮的，除了信徒們的虔誠外，還有什麼原因可說呢。聽說舊派教徒每天要到寺裏禮拜五次，每次祇少得四十分鐘時間，除了老年人外，中年以下的人因爲工作的關係，大概不能完全做到，舊派敎規比較的嚴，敎徒不可以喝酒吸烟看戲，女子並不得着新式裝束，新派教徒則沒有這許多限制，晚餐是由縣府招待，我們喝到的水帶了些鹹苦味，因爲這裏的土質含有許多鹽鹵成份的緣故，當地人爲了想吃一點淡水，常將雨水貯存下來。</p>
<p>中午到達黃河邊，並轉入靑銅峽，兩山夾抱黃河，中間寬不到一里，汽車經過的道路，是民國二十四至二十五年才沿石山開　的，全長約十幾公里，工程不算很小，峽中東岸有洗心泉，二道溝，三道溝等地名。西岸則有白色灰白塑成的小堡壘。據說是穆桂英的天門陣，一共有一百零八座，排列得像翻到的塔。至峽口，築有秦渠漢渠唐渠的壩，壩上有各渠碑記及馬鴻逵主席開鑿靑銅峽公路的碑記等石碑。出峽後，則景象便和以前迥然不同，但見田壟靑靑，芳樹迷迷，頗顯渠水灌溉之利。不久至金積縣城，我們因擬是日程到省城，匆匆即去。如在寗夏南部盆瘠地方，沒有地方上的招待，有時食宿確也會發生問題。</p>
<p>甯夏小景</p>
<p>午後二時半，至吳忠堡，這地方雖是一個鎭，在經濟上却成了寗夏的商業中心，一般人都叫牠做「寗夏的上海」，而它發展起來，只是最近幾年的事，寗夏捐稅，都係依據地區大小攤派，而該地富商巨賈多，於是造成它的特別的繁榮，街市面積似乎不很大，可是房屋都是火磚砌的一式的西式建築，街道寬敞，並且兩旁長着靑綠的柳，非常整齊和美麗，而鎭外田壟靑靑，大有生氣，當走了幾天荒漠的地方以後，尤其如見了奇蹟一樣覺得希異。可惜爲了趕路，汽車米停即去。一點多鐘後，到了黃河波口，河水在此處似乎還不及嘉陵江水來得急。但因完全靠人力撐渡，所以也花了上一點鐘的時間。待抵彼岸，已近黃昏，未到省城，天色便黑下來了。隱約中似尚見芳樹流水，土房墾地。一會兒，月亮上來，巨大如輪，江如燕脂，投影水中，更爲美絕。晚八時抵省城，走進外關，還須經過一層城門，街道現得很寬敞，電燈則發射出不很明亮的燈光，我們被引導住在招待—銀川飯店。</p>
<p>在省城一直住了五整天，這兒物價還便宜。</p>
<p>這兒的商業，却甚蕭條，大槪是因爲人口不過二三萬，消費能力薄弱，對外交通復不十分便利的緣故。但是市面相當的整齊淸潔，店鋪雖都不是西式的建築？却有着一律的樣式，這整齊淸潔幾個字，在寗夏許多地方實在都能够適用。</p>
<p>讀了岳武穆「滿江江」詞的人，對於賀蘭山總該有一個深刻的幻象吧，到了寗夏，我們舉目看到的橫在天際的一條山脈，那就是賀蘭山，距離寗夏只四十幾公里，我們原擬坐汽車去玩一天，後來因爲預定的一天刮了風便中止下來，這在將來想到，也一定要寄與深深的惋惜的。（十一月十三柏齊寄）</p>

<h3>記忠王李秀成（上）</h3>
<p>— 甫</p>
<p>提起太平天國的領袖們，最令我神往的，是翼王石達開和忠王李秀成。而秀成身處疑朝，以一身負軍國重任，外當强敵，內受讒詬於羣小，卒能以身殉國，與大京共存亡，其忠義凜然之氣，可稱雖能可貴，以視文文山之忠於宋，史閣部之忠於明，實無多讓：無怪城破被俘之後，曾國藩待之以殊禮，而一朝被難，南京居民設祭，哭者數萬戶。梁啟超嘗論秀成曰：「李秀成眞豪傑者！當危急存亡之頃，滿城上下，命在旦夕，猶能驅使健兒千數百，突圍決戰，幾殲敵師…－及城已破，復能以愛馬救幼主，而慷慨決死，有國亡與亡之志，雖古之大臣儒將，何以過之？項羽之烏鴉不逝，文山之漆寶無靈，天耶！人耶？」讀了這幾句話，我想誰也會爲秀成　一掬英雄之淚吧。</p>
<p>秀成初投身於太平，不過在前敵當一個走卒，其父親還是充一名炊手兵，太平攻下永安以後，始叙功擢升爾司馬，因爲生性好學，喜歡請書，每得民間書，輒於枕戈待旦時讀之，致違太平禁令，罪當誅，如果不是淸軍攻陷永安，把他當作一個被俘者放釋出來，也許就在自家的鋼刀之下，做了無名的犧牲祭禮，不但他的才力事功，將無從表現，卽後來太平天國的下半部歷史，也會毫無精采地湮滅下去。</p>
<p>當秀成被擒之後，曾國荃嘗欲加　下秀成於獄，國藩不可，曰：「是人活我朝之官吏多多矣，不可示以褊狹，爲彼齒冷，」因逐日設宴，待以客禮，優厚有加。這並不是顯示國　的寬大，恰是秀成感人之深的有力說明。太平天國的旗幟是推翻韃虜，光復故物，其於淸官臣，自然一律視同敵體不稍假借。但是一經　除武裝之後，秀成便禁止殺戮，無論滿官也罷，滿兵也罷，無不一視同仁，待以優禮：這在太平諸將領中，除了豁達大度的石達開以外，怕祇有秀成才能辦到。舉例來說如禮葬浙江巡　王有齡，悍將張國樑，如派員護送學政張錫庚，總兵文瑞，卸任布政使林福祥等出境，並各餽以資斧；如厚撫蘇州降卒五六萬人，無不表示他的寬大，無怪梁啓超譽爲「有戰時文明國文法之意焉」。至於趙景賢被執，辱駡求速死，譚紹洗以不能堪，槍擊洞穿其胸，秀成至欲殺紹洗以儆衆，那更是難能可貴的事了。</p>
<h3>徵文録取第二名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 賈粟香</p>
<p>我已經是花甲以外的人了，人老珠黃不値錢，這是我的實在情形，又何必拿了毛錐子，與一般少年壯年，在文字塲中角逐呢？但是老當益壯，寗知白首之心，古人王子安所說的兩句名言，頗足以使我自奮，所以得了此題，不禁見獵心喜，現在把我所有約計畫，略寫數行，以作我今年文字上的貢獻。</p>
<p>甲　關於教育約計畫</p>
<p>（一）續授國文　我擔任敎授大中舉國又，已近三十年，平日注重講讀，絕不敢稍有敷衍，今年起續授國文，擬令學生注重還講，使他們對於書中意義，能澈底明瞭，庶幾通了國文，其他史地生物公民等科，也可以迎刃而齊。</p>
<p>（二）編纂課本　中學歷史課本，自去年起，書局書館，絕少出售，以致敎授中學歷史一科，發生難得課本的問題。我自今年起，擬編臬此項課本，付之油印，以供上課之用，使授者受者，均免有課無本之弊。</p>
<p>（三）補撰辭書　辭書是國學方面必備的參考書籍，現在通行乏本，若辭源辭海等書，尙有缺略，每感不敷應用。自今年起，我擬搜羅辭書所漏列之名辭，加以撰釋，作辭書之補遺，於國學之參考，或不無小補。</p>
<p>乙關於慈善約計畫</p>
<p>（一）勉力設計　我擔任慈善機關董事之職，先後已有三十餘年，現仟設計組的職務，雖賠飯折工夫，似於我無甚權利，但樂此不疲，我心却願勉力以盡義務。我覺得現在所任的慈善機關，急待解決的，就是施棺問題，現在施棺一具，至少須耗二百圓左右，慈善機關，實有難乎爲繼之勢。我的設計，擬請將所收路斃，概免棺殮，直接予以土葬，這種辦法，在五年前成立掩埋隊時，曾經實行，現在若能倣照辦理，施棺問題，就可解決。</p>
<p>（二）勸募寒衣　慈善機關，一年中較重要的工作，就是冬振。冬振之中，一部分工作，就是施衣，現値今年的開始，離開舉辦冬振尙遠，似尙談不到施衣問題。但未雨綢繆，終勝臨渴掘井，况春夏預購寒衣，其價必較臨時購置爲廉。我擬擔任此項勸募工作，在春夏時着力，使捐輸者得將購價較廉之衣慨然樂助，這就是商人夏則資皮之意，免得到了將近冬天，寒衣價張，有不易勸慕之情勢。</p>
<p>丙關於生活約計畫</p>
<p>（一）省用食米　我家無恒產，自米貴以來，每日三餐，就發生問題，近幾個月中，雖有戶口米可領，但所得十日之糧，僅足供五日之食。其餘所缺之米，尙須自行另購，另購之價，約較戶口米高三倍，這種情形，眞使我難以支持。現爲省用計，決自今年起，每日煮粥飯，半用食米，半用雜糧，雜糧之價，較戶口米爲貴，較市販所售之米爲賤，如此的支持下去，八口之家，或可以無飢了。</p>
<p>（二）撙節實用　我的雜用，屬於嗜好的，如紙烟一項，每月需費約五十元：屬於娛樂的，如觀電影一項，每月需費約二十元；覜劇一項，每月需費約三十元；醵餐一項，每月需費約四十元，現擬自今年起，將以上四項雜用，一律撙節，節至不費分毫，或者我的生活方面，也可以稍形寬展。</p>
<p>（三）儉維嫁事　我的第四個女兒，近將出嫁，我以現値非常時期，決計力行儉的，不登報，不發東，妝奩既不舖張，酒食亦不設備，其他一切均以儉的爲主，庶於我的生活方面，不至發生什麼影響。</p>
<p>（四）經營商店　我非資本家，不能經營商業，但籌措一二千元資本，經營一所小商店，尙可勉强而行，此店倩老妻作協理，專售幾種熟食，（如豆粥餛飩糉子之類）以博蠅頭微利，庶我的生活方面，也可以稍有補助。從前太公賣飯，趙岐賣餅，書籍上傳爲美談。我的欲開小商店，就是賣飯賣餅的意思，這個計劃，若有成　，我的生活問題，也可以解决了。</p>
<p>（五）出賣著作從前相如之賦，賣給漢宮皇后，樂天之詩，賣給雞林賈人，寒士生涯，以賣文自活，這是古人所常有之事。我平日爲人著作，均不取潤筆，今年起，爲生活計，決規定潤格，散文潤較廉，駢文潤較貴，無論序記，銘誄，詩詞，歌聯，均依照潤格取潤，如此，庶於我的生活方面，得有些小小的幫助。</p>
<p>以上所列，關於敎育約計畫，共有三項；關於慈善約計畫，共有二項；關於生活約計畫，共有五項；就我的狀况而言尙覺輕而易舉；就我的能力而言，亦非窒礙難行，惟言之匪艱，行之惟艱，我做這篇文字，尙不覺其難，我照這篇文字做到事實，却覺得有些吃力。所願事在人爲，我能努力以赴，庶幾一年終了，我約計畫，有十分之四五，可以實踐。</p>

<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譚</p>
<p>不過最特著的是她在吉普斯身上所施的改造工作。在他結婚之前，他是一個枯燥乏味並且帶些無可無不可的人；他爲勃洛克菲爾德的大衆所喜歡，並且當做好人，可是他並非一個大得人心，引起極大熱愛的人。他在勃洛克菲爾德已經二十五年以上，時閒的長久足以使他成功一個還算好的像伙，一個努力工作的人；可是太長久了，誰也不會相信，他能够再有所進步。事實上他已經開始在腐化了，這種腐化是枯燥的敎授法所逐漸養成的是這種職業上最惡劣，最末後的陷坑；每年敎育同樣的功課，生活有如刻板一樣，其他事情一落入這刻板裏面，也就自為調整，變成不急不徐的樣子了。他工作得很好；他是憑良心作事的；他是一個能服務，能給人滿意，信託，以及一切的人，却就缺少的蛮勵。</p>
<p>終於這偶令人驚奇的少女型的妻子來了，誰也沒有料到-宵普斯自己尤其沒有料到。她使他在大家的目光中，成功了一個新人；雖然這種新，大部份還只是各種事情恢復到溫暖而有生氣的地步，這各種事情本來是衰老的，被禁錮看的，並且沒有想到的。他的眼睛裏發出了光彩；他的心智，如果本來不是卓越地準備過的，却也滴當地準備過的，也開始更加冒險地活動起來了。幽默之感他是時常具有的，從此也突然大爲開展，得到了成熟，使他的年齡减輕了不少。他開始覺得凡事更有把握；他的紀律進步到了不過於嚴厲的地步；他更加受人的歡迎。他初到勃洛克匪爾德來的時候，他的目的是被人親愛，尊敬，和服從-無論如何要被人服從。服從他果然獲得了，尊敬也已經給了他：可是親愛却直到現在才來，這是學生們對於一個人的突然親愛，這個人現在是和靄的，却不軟弱，很了解他們，却不過份，他個人的幸福和他們的幸福已聯結在一起。（十二）</p>

<h3>Wartime Production Rationalization</h3>
<p>For days we have discussed the development of wartime production, and we hope to attract the attention of the authorities in Sino-Japanese relations and entrepreneurs of all sizes; however, we must particularly remind everyone that all wartime production must be rationalized to more effectively increase wartime production.</p>
<p>The so-called rationalization of wartime production is the reasonable coordination of all wartime production undertakings. Obstacles to the increase and stability of production. Now, leaving aside political obstacles, let’s just talk about technical aspects. First, there is an excessive dependence on the weather, which of course must be addressed through water conservancy and forestry. When it comes to water conservancy, it involves things like digging canals, building dams, constructing sluice gates, building dikes, digging wells, storing water, and diverting water. All of these require manufacturing and supply from the industrial sector. Second is the cultivation of soil, that is, the fertilizer problem. At present, the agricultural sector has an extremely urgent need for fertilizers. Foreign supplies are almost non-existent, and the domestic fertilizer industry is extremely poor. Neither phosphorous, nitrogenous, sulfurous, nor calcareous fertilizers can help agriculture solve the fertilizer problem. In fact, Japan is a well-known fertilizer-producing country, and Manchuria’s soybean cakes were the main source of fertilizer for Chinese (especially Jiangsu and Zhejiang) farmland in the past. As this East Asian axis accelerates, it seems that there should be some performance in this area. Third, there is an insufficiency of manpower and animal power. After joining the war, the rational allocation of manpower and animal power in rural areas will naturally be even more worthy of attention and consideration. The difficulty of this power can only be solved technically by applying more mechanical power so that plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and water lifting can all utilize machinery as much as possible, to adapt to the reality of the future shortage of rural labor. If the industrial sector can fully achieve these three points, agricultural production can be quite optimistic. Even if it cannot be fully achieved, partial achievement is not impossible. But regarding these, it depends on the future communication between the agricultural and industrial sectors to seek coordination. Because on the other hand, the increase in agricultural production should also suit the needs of industry. For example, molasses (made from sugarcane) required for the production of liquid fuels, tung oil, and rapeseed oil, will certainly increase in demand for future war participation, and the supply of agricultural production can be said to be very urgent. In addition, cotton and hemp required for textiles also occupy a very important position in the supply, and all are expected to be organized and planned in wartime agricultural coordination with industry.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the coordination of mining and industry. If the raw materials and fuels required by industry cannot be fully supplied by the mining sector, then industry will not be able to maximize production and may sometimes be forced to stop work entirely or partially, or reduce working hours and reduce output. The most obvious is fuel – coal. One aspect is the question of whether production is sufficient, and the other is the question of reasonable and fair distribution. Especially for factories with weak capital, if they are not given assistance, production will inevitably be affected. As for the raw materials required by the smelting industry, such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc, they also rely on the rational supply of the mining industry. Iron is an important raw material for steelmaking, and refined metals such as steel and copper are the raw materials that industry and the military industry need the most. After participating in the war, the need will naturally increase even more, and the degree of coordination between the mining and industrial sectors will also increase. The above is what industry needs from the mining sector. Conversely, the mining sector also depends on the close cooperation of industry. For example, the equipment required for mining, such as drilling, grinding, smelting, ventilation, power, transportation, repair, and construction, all require supplies from the industrial sector. Because if this supply is not rational and sufficient, then the expansion of mining equipment and the increase in production will encounter great difficulties.</p>
<p>Power and industry also require close cooperation. Many industries cannot obtain sufficient power, and therefore cannot expand equipment, increase production, and even the establishment of new factories has to accommodate the supply of power. This phenomenon is not only true in small cities, but even in large cities. Insufficient power further hinders production. However, in some places, there may be a surplus of power because the equipment of power plants exceeds the local power consumption. From another perspective, the power sector also needs the cooperation of industry, such as generators, turbine transformers, power lines, insulators required by the electricity industry, and diesel fuel required by diesel generators. If the electricity industry cannot get a sufficient supply from the industrial sector, the production and expansion of the electricity industry and the establishment of new power plants will have great difficulties.</p>
<p>Coordination is even more needed between industries. Factories that manufacture power lines need refined copper, factories that manufacture radio equipment and larger factories that manufacture machines need industrial raw materials, factories that make steel need iron, and so on. All must have mutual cooperation between various industries, otherwise it will be difficult to expect an increase in production. Moreover, in the industrial sector, especially between Chinese and Japanese industries, the squeezing, infighting, and other bad phenomena between large and small industries, the conspiracy of the big fish eating the small fish, cannot always be avoided, and of course there is no talk of cooperation. In the future, this can no longer be improved.</p>
<p>In addition, finance cannot cooperate with industry, so that the turnover of industrial funds is very difficult, and transportation cannot cooperate with industry, so that the construction of industry and the supply of raw materials all encounter great difficulties. And the lack of cooperation between agriculture, forestry, mining, industry, finance, transportation and other industries is equally huge and serious. For all of these, it is hoped that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will, with a selfless spirit, implement the most complete planned production under the premise of considering both wartime needs and postwar development, completely including all production undertakings in the peace zone. At the same time, one of the existing many economic institutions must be selected, or a wartime economic institution must be established to give full power, concentrate talent, and be responsible for the planning, adjustment, and coordination of production undertakings. The original competent authorities of various economic and production undertakings, as well as important production undertakings, should always maintain close contact, exchange opinions frankly, and review gains and losses, all with the interests of the country and the nation as the premise, and strive for effective cooperation. In this way, production undertakings can be brought into the right track, fully developed, play the greatest role, and work together to win the victory of the Greater East Asia War and stabilize the economy and national life in the peace zone.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang concluded successfully at noon on the 15th. After the meeting, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Propaganda Department at 3:00 p.m. and gave a speech on the situation of the conference. The general idea is as follows: A total of 49 draft proposals were discussed in detail at this conference, all of which were passed and handed over to the Standing Committee and relevant departments for reference and handling. The focus of the discussion was on issues related to participation in the war. There were also very detailed discussions on wartime culture, economic propaganda, youth training, etc., and important decisions were made, the most important of which were: (1) In view of the inappropriateness of the current secondary school system, the four-year secondary school and two-year university preparatory system will be restored. (2) It is stipulated that Pan-Asianism, the Chairman's speeches, the Outline of the New Life Movement, and the East Asian League Movement should be listed as the focus of civic education in the future. (3) In order to expand propaganda, complete the Greater East Asia War, and strive to promote the New Life Movement, a national propaganda conference will be held regularly. (4) The focus of the work of the various ministries of the Central Committee in the future will be to mobilize all colleagues to work hard to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, increase production, and ensure public security, etc. In addition, there are many important proposals on the prohibition of opium, the prohibition of drugs, the food problem, as well as the organization, training, and propaganda aspects of party affairs.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Haitong News Agency) A well-informed source here told Haitong News Agency today that the abolition of other Chinese political parties will be the theme of discussion at the Fifth Plenary Session this morning, in order to promote China's relationship of sharing weal and woe. It is said that the Great People's Society and other organizations will be cleared up. This can indeed be said to be a great victory for the Kuomintang and the Chairman. From now on, the Kuomintang will step up its work in various places. It is said that the Kuomintang is now planning to set up a branch party headquarters in Peiping. From this, it can be seen that the result of Chairman Wang Yitang of the North China Political Affairs Commission's visit to Nanjing this time has made the relationship between North China and Central China closer. Therefore, it is expected that the New People's Society will also be abolished. This measure will undoubtedly have a major impact on China's war facilities.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is as follows: When the Premier of our Party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, went north in November of the thirteenth year of the Republic, he detoured through Kobe and gave a speech on Pan-Asianism. This was the speech after the Three Principles of the People, and it was also the last speech in the Premier's life. In March of the following year, the Premier passed away in Peiping. In his will, he earnestly urged his comrades to abolish unequal treaties. Since then, seventeen or eighteen years have passed. Unfortunately, disputes have occurred between China and Japan, leading to war and suffering, which has pleased the Anglo-American imperialists and pained the East Asian comrades. Until today, the Republic of China has finally regained the original appearance of Pan-Asianism, cooperating with the friendly nation of Japan to participate in the Greater East Asia War, drive out the enemies of East Asia, the Anglo-American imperialists, and unite the 1 billion East Asian compatriots to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War for the East Asian comrades and seek the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At this time, the friendly nation of Japan also assisted the Republic of China in abolishing unequal treaties, returning concessions, and abolishing extraterritorial rights, in order to complete the necessary conditions for the Republic of China's independence and autonomy. Alas, the Premier's will and the long-cherished wishes of the 400 million compatriots have been fulfilled in one day. When the comrades of our Party met at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, they saw this epoch-making progress, recalling the past, and could not help but feel both sad and happy. Looking forward to the future, they were even more excited.</p>
<p>Since the Sixth National Congress of our Party, it has promoted the importance of peace, saying that if China cannot obtain equality and freedom, it will not have the ability to share responsibility for East Asia, and the complete acquisition of China's equality and freedom must be sought in the liberation of East Asia. Therefore, at the beginning of the peace movement, it responded to the friendly nation of Japan's proposal to build a new order in East Asia based on Pan-Asianism. The so-called peace should be a true, permanent, and just peace. It is not a name that can be borrowed by post-war exhaustion and respite, nor is it a purpose that can be achieved by being confined to narrow nationalism and seeking its own revival. Following this main point, evolving and progressing, since the establishment of the Treaty on Basic Relations between China and Japan and the joint declaration of the three countries, and the formation of the Axis, since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has made a statement of sharing weal and woe, and the trend has been decided. Taking a further step to participate in the Greater East Asia War is a natural step, and also the final decision. Compatriots across the country should do their best to achieve this in this great era, and our Party comrades should be aware of the greatness of their mission, the uniqueness of their responsibility, and sacrifice everything to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, so that China will gain freedom and East Asia will be liberated because of the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Here are a few things to tell our Party comrades:</p>
<p>First, the East Asian League Movement and the New Life Movement were initiated by our Party comrades. One focuses on external unity and the other focuses on internal reform. Both originate from the same starting point and aim to achieve a common goal. Now that we have entered the period of participation in the war, all our comrades should know that the East Asian League is the ideal organization for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the New Life Movement is the necessary condition for China to obtain the qualifications to share the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They should be based on the spirit of working hard and setting an example, leading the people. All our comrades should know the meaning of "those who teach by example will be followed." The implementation of the Outline of the New Life Movement does not depend on words but on deeds. The Premier once painfully defended its falsehood: "Knowing is not difficult, but doing is difficult." Therefore, all our comrades should be in awe.</p>
<p>Second, when the friendly nation of Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it took on the front line alone, causing the Anglo-American forces to be shattered. How much can China, after its exhaustion, contribute to the Greater East Asia War? This is what our Party comrades should deeply consider. However, the friendly nation of Japan not only supports China's participation in the war, but also provides assistance to China when it participates in the war, so that it can independently enter the realm of independence and autonomy. There is no other reason than to unite the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and enable the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to be realized. China, here, only has the purpose of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together, and practicing it vigorously. Only by sharing weal and woe together can we turn bitterness into sweetness. Only by living and dying together can we survive in death. From now on, the relationship between China and Japan will become even closer. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand are common builders of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The nations of Germany and Italy are common creators of the new world order. Recently, Italy and Japan have taken the same steps to assist China, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. All our comrades should redouble their efforts for this kind of profound friendship and generous act in order to consolidate the East Asia Axis and the World Axis.</p>
<p>Third, for a hundred years, Anglo-American forces have been deeply rooted in people's hearts. It is not only the oppression and exploitation in politics, military affairs, and economics, but also the cultural anesthesia, which is even more poisonous and harmful. China's participation in the war is not only to eliminate the tyrannical forces of the Anglo-Americans in form, but also to fundamentally eradicate the anesthesia of the Anglo-Americans in psychology. All our comrades should follow the principle of "attacking the heart is the best strategy" so that all attempts to sow discord and divide East Asia will have no way to proceed. Only then can the unity of East Asia be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Fourth, the above three points are based on principles. As for specific methods, we should take the military point of view. The significance of the Greater East Asia War should be popularized and deepened. Productivity should be increased, and all production factors should have a surplus for reproduction. Security should be strengthened. This is the greatest policy of administration and economy, and also the greatest purpose of the military. All our comrades should first concentrate their efforts on this, so that their mental and material strength will not be wasted.</p>
<p>Fifth, it is true that a small number of people in Chongqing are obsessed, but most people are still stuck in the middle of wandering and watching. All our comrades should no longer be tolerant of the small number of people who are obsessed, but for the majority, they should understand the crux of the problem and strive to establish a model of peace and a model of East Asian co-prosperity to increase their belief in us. Then, their internal conversion can be counted on the days. The way to promote comprehensive peace lies in this.</p>
<p>The above five points are the main points. All our comrades, if they want to practice them, should first examine their own organizational and training capabilities, and especially examine their inner hearts. The purity of the inner heart is the source of courage. The courage is unyielding, the spirit is more and more used, and the wisdom is more and more clear. The great achievement is achieved. The good or bad of politics depends on the tension and slackness of party affairs. The praise of party affairs depends on the purity of the inner heart. Today's affairs cannot be made safe and stable and saved from danger and survival if the country and the nation are not contributed with the purest and most sincere mental and material strength. The guidance and encouragement of the people of the country is only in our Party. All our comrades, the relationship is great and the responsibility is heavy. Is the Republic of China cut off by our Party itself, or is it saved by our Party itself? Can the Republic of China fulfill its responsibility as a member of East Asia and share the safety and danger of East Asia, or will it be alienated from East Asia? In a word, it depends on how our Party works. The spirit of the Premier in heaven is really something to rely on. All our comrades, work hard and don't neglect it.</p>
<h3>Vice President Zhou Gave a Broadcast Last Night: "Clarifying Questions about China's Participation in the War"</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) Zhou, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, gave a broadcast in Nanjing on the evening of the 15th, entitled "Clarifying Questions about China's Participation in the War." The main points are as follows: The National Government has already declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month. Compatriots all over the country should be of one heart and one mind, be diligent and courageous, and cooperate with friendly nations to win the final victory. However, as far as I know, some people still have many doubts and misunderstandings about China's participation in the war. I will now list them one by one for explanation and clarification. First, some people think that China's participation in the war is forced by the friendly nation of Japan and has to be implemented. This conjecture is completely wrong. Second, some people think that if China participates in the war, the burden will be heavier and the people will suffer more. This is also a rash talk that does not understand the facts and does not understand the benefits. If we cannot enjoy the harvest of the victorious country with the status of a belligerent country, we will still have to bear the same burden and the same suffering. What are we doing for? Therefore, participating in the war is absolutely beneficial to China. Third, some people think that Britain and the United States will definitely win in the future. Why should we get involved in the whirlpool and perish with them in the future? This argument is even more wrong. Can Britain and the United States win? I dare say that they do not have this certainty. In terms of military affairs, the strategic points of the Pacific have been occupied by the friendly forces. In terms of resources, the gasoline that the United States is proud of already has a very rich source of rice in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the military resources such as rubber and tin that the United States has always relied on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can no longer be imported to the United States. Therefore, the final victory of Britain and the United States is absolutely uncertain. What are we afraid of? Fourth, some people think that if China participates in the war, Japan will take the name of joint operations to impose great restrictions on China's sovereignty. This is completely an unfounded worry that obliterates the facts. Fifth, some people think that the purpose of the peace movement is to seek comprehensive peace. If China participates in the war, will it not close the door to comprehensive peace? This argument is really very shallow. We want to achieve comprehensive peace, there is only one way, and that is to quickly defeat the Anglo-Americans, defeat the Anglo-Americans who bind Chongqing and do not allow him to engage in comprehensive peace. Sixth, some people think that if Japan wins, China will be even more in trouble. Why should we participate in the war to help him win? This doubt is answered in two points: (1) Japan did not ask China to participate in the war. China participated in the war voluntarily. This is enough to prove that Japan has long been prepared to fight alone to win the victory. (2) Japan's final and complete victory is only beneficial to China and will never be harmful. Seventh, some people think that after participating in the war, we will have to draw conscripts, restrict withdrawals, economic controls will be more stringent, and production will be more depressed. These concerns are also unnecessary. The above explanations are given for all kinds of doubtful psychology and arguments one by one. What I said is not at all sophistry, but is completely based on facts. Since there is nothing to worry about in participating in the war, everyone should do their best and unite as one to complete the final victory with all their strength. Britain and the United States said this year is the year of counterattack. We will use facts to shatter their dream of counterattack.</p>

As far as the battle situation in Tunisia is concerned, apart from air battles, there were only slight skirmishes between the German army and the French separatist forces west of Kairouan. According to Axis sources, the British Eighth Army is now preparing to launch again. A major battle east of Misurata may break out at any time. The 44th and 51st Divisions of the British Army are now deployed on the coastal highway. The British 10th Tank Division is deployed in the area south of it for cover. Further south, the 7th Tank Corps is stationed, and two New Zealand divisions are assisting in the defense. According to Berlin news, the Muslim residents of Tunisia are outraged by the constant bombing of the holy site of Kairouan by British and American aircraft and the bombing of the mausoleum of King El Uthman in Tunis, during which bombs were dropped on the tomb. The tomb of King El Uthman was bombed last Saturday, which happened to be a Muslim memorial day. Many followers from all over the world came to the mausoleum to worship.</p>

After the ceremony, Chief Ba Maw gave a speech to reporters, saying, "I am determined to carry out the Supreme Commander's wishes and use appropriate methods to provide relief to the victims to thank the Japanese government for its generosity."</p>
<h3>Japanese Garrison in China Announces Weekly Battle Report</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced a weekly battle report on January 15, stating that in the third Shandong operation that began in late November last year, 8,000 prisoners were captured, and the Communist forces in Jiaodong are on the verge of collapse. The Japanese army launched a campaign to annihilate the main force of the 171st Division of the Chongqing army, which was stirring up trouble in the Lujiang area of Anhui Province, on the 6th. Through close cooperation with the artillery, the Chongqing army, which put up stubborn resistance, was completely surrounded and annihilated. On a certain day, they occupied its important strategic point, Tuogao. They also braved the severe cold wind and snow to fight against the Chongqing army in the Dabie Mountains area under the command of Li Zongren of the Fifth War Zone, and completely destroyed the main strongholds of the Chongqing army. So far, about 6,500 Chongqing soldiers have been killed and about 1,500 captured. On January 10, Chongqing's air force attacked Jingmen in western Hubei with six P-40 aircraft, and two of them were shot down by the accurate ground artillery fire of the Japanese army. Also, January 9 was the day the National Government participated in the war, and at the same time, the Japanese side specially returned the concessions to China and abolished extraterritorial rights. As a result, the Chongqing side has completely lost its ability to resist. Furthermore, because the Japanese army has launched vigorous annihilation campaigns in various places, Chongqing's predicament has reached its final stage and entered a dead end.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement, Saying China is Defending Japan's Rear, Denies Rumors of Sino-Japanese Military Alliance, Japan Will First Return the Tianjin and Hankou Concessions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th - Reuter: Foreign Minister Chu Minyi told Reuter reporter Trentel today that all of East Asia has now declared war on Britain and the United States. China's participation in the war is only fulfilling its obligations to other East Asian countries. Japan has achieved successive victories last year, which has enabled it to take on the task of defending Japan's rear. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has been preparing for military mobilization. Japan can withdraw its troops from certain areas and be replaced by properly trained Chinese troops. The rumor that China and Japan are negotiating a military alliance is not true, but the relationship between the two countries has become closer than before. Regarding the disposal of enemy assets and all treaties concluded with Britain and the United States, they have lost their effectiveness. The disposal of enemy assets will be handled by a joint Sino-Japanese committee, and the treatment of enemy nationals will be entirely in accordance with international law. Regarding the return of concessions, Japan will first return the Hankou and Tianjin concessions, and then the Shanghai and Xiamen concessions. Finally, Foreign Minister Chu commented on Sino-German relations, saying that Stahmer has been the German ambassador to China for a year now. Although Sino-German relations have greatly improved, it is truly regrettable that Stahmer is being transferred to Tokyo. When I was previously the ambassador to Japan, I met Dr. Kordt, who has now been transferred to China as the German Chargé d'Affaires. Dr. Kordt is also very interested in Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th - Central News Agency: Regarding Italy's return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, Foreign Minister Chu decided to personally go to the Italian Embassy at 9:00 AM this morning on behalf of the government to express his gratitude.</p>

<h3>Ningxia Travelogue (Continued) Northwest Plateau is Barren and Desolate, Green Fields at the Foot of Helan Mountain</h3>
<p>Entering a Smooth Road</p>
<p>After leaving Tongxin City, the road became relatively flat and easy to travel. The car drove through a wilderness between two mountains, with no cultivated land in sight. The wilderness was only covered with clumps of grass. The areas with clumps of grass were relatively high, making the plain look like leprosy. The color of the mountains here turned iron-blue, with many uneven edges and corners, showing that the soil quality was somewhat different from before. There were no trees or water to be seen. Only near the town of Zhongning County did green trees appear beside the villages. The wolfberry trees, which had shed their leaves, were planted in the fields like cultivated seedlings. The flowing water of the Tongji Canal was also seen. The scenery outside Zhongning City was somewhat like the outskirts of Xi'an, but the city was not lively. The county government had sent people to greet us at the city gate and took us to two restaurants for breakfast. Wolfberry is a local specialty, and people were carrying it on the streets to sell. It is said that eighty yuan could buy a liter. After breakfast, we left Zhongning. The young trees along the road were protected by enclosures made of earthen bricks more than two feet high, which shows the local efforts to cultivate roadside trees. You could see people planting wolfberry nurseries next to their houses along the way. The shape of the trees looked a bit like small, gnarled pine trees. We encountered more flocks of sheep than before. When the car passed, the lambs were startled and ran away, their fat bodies appearing unsteady.</p>
<p>Arriving in Ningxia</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, we arrived at Tongxin City, the first county within Ningxia, 79 kilometers away from Zhongning. It was not easy to get there that day, so we decided to rest in Tongxin City. This was a very desolate city, without city walls, only a main street. The so-called main street was quite deserted. We didn't seem to see a southern shop selling cloth. When the car stopped, a large group of bearded men in sheepskin jackets curiously surrounded us, while women were peeking from the cracks in the doors. We went straight to the "Ningxia Provincial Government" guest house, because we definitely couldn't find any other accommodation. Although we only got a few empty rooms with ten bunks in the guest house, we received warm hospitality. From their conversations, we learned that the city was also called Banchengzi (Half City), because an earthquake had submerged half of the city a long time ago. Now the entire county has only more than 37,000 people, with only more than 2,000 people in the city. Muslims account for more than 90% of the total population. There are also as many as five mosques, which are led by them. We visited one or two mosques, one was an old-style temple, and the other was a new-style temple. It is said that there is also a new-new style. Both temples were quite grand and magnificent. In such a desolate and poor place, there are such beautiful temples. What other reason can be said besides the piety of the believers? It is said that old-style religious followers have to go to the temple to worship five times a day, each time for at least forty minutes. Except for the elderly, people under middle age probably cannot fully do so because of work. The old-style religious rules are relatively strict. Followers are not allowed to drink, smoke, or watch plays. Women are not allowed to wear new-style clothes. New-style religious followers do not have so many restrictions. Dinner was hosted by the county government. The water we drank had a slightly salty and bitter taste because the soil here contains many salt and halogen components. Locals often store rainwater to drink a little fresh water.</p>
<p>At noon, we arrived at the Yellow River and entered the Qingtong Gorge. The Yellow River is sandwiched between two mountains, with a width of less than a kilometer in the middle. The road the car passed through was opened along the rocky mountains from the 24th to 25th year of the Republic of China (1935-1936), with a total length of about a dozen kilometers. The project was not very small. On the east bank of the gorge, there are place names such as Xixin Spring, Erdao Gully, and Sandao Gully. On the west bank, there are small fortresses made of white and grayish-white plastic. It is said to be Mu Guiying's Tianmen Formation, with a total of one hundred and eight formations, arranged like upside-down pagodas. At the mouth of the gorge, there are dams of the Qin Canal, Han Canal, and Tang Canal. On the dams, there are stone steles with inscriptions of each canal and the inscription of Chairman Ma Hongkui opening the Qingtong Gorge Highway. After exiting the gorge, the scenery is completely different from before. You can see green fields and fragrant trees, showing the benefits of canal irrigation. Soon we arrived at the city of Jinji County. Because we planned to go to the provincial capital according to the schedule, we left in a hurry. In the southern basin of Ningxia, in poor places, without local hospitality, food and accommodation may sometimes be a problem.</p>
<p>Ningxia Snippets</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, we arrived at Wuzhong Fort. Although this place is a town, it has become the commercial center of Ningxia in terms of economy. People generally call it "the Shanghai of Ningxia," and its development has only been in recent years. Ningxia's donations and taxes are allocated based on the size of the region, and there are many wealthy merchants here, which has created its special prosperity. The area of the market does not seem to be very large, but the houses are all Western-style buildings made of fire bricks, and the streets are wide, with green willows growing on both sides, which is very neat and beautiful. The fields outside the town are lush and full of vitality. After walking through desolate places for a few days, it felt like seeing a miracle. Unfortunately, in order to hurry, the car left without stopping. More than an hour later, we arrived at the Yellow River bank. The river water here does not seem to be as rapid as the Jialing River. But because it completely relies on manpower to support the crossing, it also took a bit of time. By the time we reached the other side, it was almost dusk. Before we arrived at the provincial capital, it was already dark. In the dimness, we seemed to see fragrant trees and flowing water, and earthen houses and cultivated land. After a while, the moon rose, huge like a wheel, and the river was like rouge, projecting into the water, which was even more beautiful. We arrived at the provincial capital at 8:00 PM. Walking into the outer gate, we still had to go through another city gate. The streets seemed very wide, and the electric lights emitted a not very bright light. We were led to the guest house—Yinchuan Hotel.</p>
<p>We stayed in the provincial capital for five whole days. Prices here are still cheap.</p>
<p>However, the commerce here is very depressed, probably because the population is only two or three hundred thousand, the consumption capacity is weak, and the external transportation is not very convenient. But the city is quite neat and clean. Although the shops are not Western-style buildings, they have a uniform style. These words neat and clean can really be applied in many places in Ningxia.</p>
<p>Those who have read Yue Fei's "Manjianghong" should have a deep image of the Helan Mountains. When we arrived in Ningxia, the mountain range stretching across the horizon that we saw was the Helan Mountains, only forty kilometers away from Ningxia. We originally planned to take a car to play for a day, but we stopped it because a wind was blowing on the scheduled day. When I think about this in the future, I will definitely feel deep regret.

<h3>Nanshi to Implement Sugar Rationing Next Month, Plan for Rationing Sugar by Population Determined, Prices to be Announced in Advance Monthly, Sugar Purchase Certificates Must Be Stamped with Head of Household's Seal</h3>
<p>The serious situation of sugar in this city has not yet been completely resolved. Therefore, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has adopted a method of rationing sugar by population in order to make it universal and eliminate the threat of sugar. It is scheduled to be implemented in the Nanshi area starting next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The method of rationing sugar by population, based on the Baojia system, is scheduled to be implemented in the Nanshi area starting next month. The Baojia system is the basis for handling sugar rationing. All application forms for sugar rations and simplified sugar rationing regulations for Nanshi households have been printed. The Cooperative Business Office specially submitted them to the Municipal Police Headquarters yesterday, requesting that each Fang Public Office be instructed to fill in the correct household population figures and send them by the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>The entire city, including the concessions, will implement sugar rationing. Although sugar rationing will be implemented in Nanshi first, the scope of sugar rationing will include the two concessions, Hongkou, Huxi, Zhabei and other areas. The population in each area is stipulated to be in units of Jia. The Jia heads will fill in the application forms for sugar rations for each household in the Jia, with one original and two copies, and each household head will affix a seal to be used as a basis for allocation. If there are any changes in the household population, the Jia heads will notify the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office before the 15th of each month for adjustment.</p>
<p>One sugar certificate will be issued per person. Regarding the sugar rationing, it has been decided that it will be given once a month, with one sugar purchase certificate issued per person. The Jia heads will distribute the certificates to each household. If there are attached households, the household heads will distribute them to each attached household. They must not make things difficult for any reason. Those who violate this will be punished by the relevant authorities. The allocation of sugar will be based on the sufficient balance of 16 taels per person. Sugar is divided into three types: green sugar, red sugar, and white sugar, which can be sold together at any time. The amount and price of sugar allocated per person each time will be announced by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office in various newspapers in the city on the first day of each month for universal knowledge in order to prevent fraud.</p>
<p>Citizens are not forced to purchase sugar. The procedures for citizens to purchase sugar have also been determined by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. Citizens are not forced to purchase sugar after obtaining the issued sugar purchase certificate. If they need to purchase sugar, they can fill in the Baojia to which they belong on the back of the certificate, then affix the original seal of the household head, bring sugar containers, and take the certificate to the designated retail sugar merchant for purchase. However, the retail merchant must verify that the seal matches before allowing the purchase. In addition to filling in the Baojia to which they belong on the back of the sugar certificate, attached households must also have the seal of the household head affixed. The household heads must not refuse or make things difficult. The validity period of the sugar certificate is stipulated to be limited to 4:00 PM on the last day of each month. It will be invalidated after the deadline. If it is lost, it will not be reissued.</p>
<p>Those who disrupt control will be severely punished. The retail sugar merchants who sell sugar have been designated by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and have been assigned numbers. The numbers and locations of the retail merchants are marked in front of each retail merchant's store, and the office will print and send them to the Jia heads for safekeeping. Citizens can inquire with the Jia heads at any time for purchase. At the same time, in order to effectively prevent retail sugar merchants from committing fraud and seeking profit, if there is any situation of exceeding the price limit, deducting the amount, or mixing, the sugar purchaser can report it to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at any time, and the authorities will be requested to severely punish them for the crime of disrupting control. Those who forge sugar purchase certificates will also be dealt with in the same way if they are found.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Controls Goods, Maintains Normal Supply, Prices Based on Legal Profits, Considers Both Businessmen's and Citizens' Interests</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Department separated from the General Office on January 1 this year and became an independent institution, its internal organization has been greatly expanded. The number of working staff has increased from the initial 12 to more than 100. The current system is divided into four sections: cost accounting and investigation, price limit execution, goods supply, and guilds. The cost accounting and investigation section specializes in evaluating standard research. The price limit execution section sends staff to various stores every day to investigate business and pricing conditions. If any violations of price limits are found, they will be punished. The goods supply section is responsible for the supply of food and other items. The guild section specializes in contacting various trade guilds in the city to provide considerable guidance and assistance for evaluation and allocation matters.</p>
<p>Actively Adopts Low-Price Policy Because the scope of work is expanding and the nature of the work is becoming more complex, the Goods Control Department has had to improve the city's overall price and goods situation based on the most basic policies. In terms of controlling prices, it actively adopts a low-price policy, but only to the extent that it does not hinder the legitimate and legal interests of all industries. If an industry has a situation where it is necessary to revise prices based on actual reasons, it will be given more favorable consideration upon application. However, the price control authorities also take into account the interests of general consumers and do not allow them to suffer undue losses due to price increases. In terms of goods control, the problem is not as simple as price limits. To control the distribution of goods, it is necessary to first grasp the source of the goods. In the current environment, although the possibility of difficulties is greater, the Shanghai Municipal Council will do its best to maintain the normal state of goods supply.</p>
<p>Communicating Official-Business Cooperation and Implementation Among the various sections of the Goods Control Department, the one with the shortest establishment history but the most responsibility is the guild section. Currently, among the trade guilds in the city, there are more than 300 units that have registered with the Police Department and have close contact with this section. Whenever various industries intend to revise prices or need to obtain sources of goods, they can apply to this section for consideration by the highest authorities of the Goods Control Department. The purpose of establishing this section is to communicate the relationship between the Shanghai Municipal Council and various industries. When various industries have difficulties, the guild section tries its best to solve them. When the Shanghai Municipal Council implements any price policy, various industries assist and cooperate in its implementation. In terms of internal organization, the guild section is divided into investigation, review, and supervision sections. The work of each section is closely related to the implementation of contacting various industries and communicating official-business. The person in charge is currently Mr. Sheng Yuqi.</p>
<h3>Central Market Project Abolishes Middlemen to Suppress Vegetable Prices</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, this port, according to a report in the Continental News last night (Friday night), in order to suppress the cost of living for Shanghai citizens, the Central Market of Shanghai Special Municipality has planned to improve. One of the main reforms is to abolish the middlemen who hinder transactions. The Central Market Planning Committee, which investigates the prices and costs of goods from north and south of the Yangtze River, pointed out that the reason for the high prices of vegetables and daily necessities is the monopoly of middlemen.</p>
<h3>Anti-British and American Association Broadcasts Tonight</h3>
<p>In order to clarify the significance of the government's participation in the war this time and to enable the public to fully understand, the Shanghai Radio Station in this city is scheduled to invite the Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation to host a radio speech starting at 9:30 tonight (16th). Tonight, the Propaganda Department of the Association and Mr. Chen Binhe, advisor to the Association, will speak on the topic "The Obligations that Citizens Should Fulfill After Participating in the War." There should be a detailed exposition of the responsibilities of the people in wartime.</p>
<h3>Hankou Branch of Bank of Communications and Central Bank Scheduled to Reopen Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In order to revitalize finance in the Wuhan area, the financial authorities of this city have formed a reopening committee for the Hankou branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. According to a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the Hankou branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank is scheduled to reopen on the 17th of this month and will officially begin operations on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Prevent Remittances to Guangzhou, Cash Buying</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transfer of funds from various places, after the Central Reserve Bank reduced the exchange rate for remittances from Shanghai to various places, various circles have been eager to entrust the bank to remit funds. Therefore, the bank's remittance business has broken historical records in recent times. Among them, the amount remitted to Guangzhou is the largest. Originally, because the price of gold in Guangzhou is currently worth 1,830 to 40 yuan per tael, general speculators in Shanghai have been remitting cash to Guangzhou for cash buying. Now it is learned that the authorities have discovered this matter and believe that this move has a significant impact on finance. Therefore, Japanese banks and the Central Reserve Bank have restricted remittances to Guangzhou, with a maximum remittance of 2,000 yuan each time, and an application must be made.</p>
<h3>Radios with Seven or More Tubes: Deadline for Submission to Purchasing Office, Acquired by Japanese Military</h3>
<p>A public notice from the Wireless Radio Supervision Office states, "Regarding the ‘seal’ marked radios (those with seven or more tubes) registered this time at this office and the temporary registration office at 733 Route Pichon in the French Concession, they are now being acquired by the Japanese military. Therefore, all people holding such radios must, according to the number on the upper corner of the registration certificate issued by this office and the designated dates below, send the radio in question, along with the registration certificate from this office and the registration certificate from the former police station (or police bureau), to the purchasing office at 133 Sichuan Road. This is a public notice.</p>
<p>The purchasing office is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Those currently applying for permission to continue using their radios will have their applications decided upon within the next few days. Those whose applications are denied must send their radios to the aforementioned office by February 22nd.</p>
<p>From the 18th to the 22nd of this month, 200 numbers will be processed each day, calculated sequentially according to the registration number:</p>

<h3>Generous Donations from Industrial and Commercial Sectors: Sympathy for Impoverished Students. Shen Bao Education Fund Begins Accepting Applications Yesterday. Hundreds of Students Braving the Cold to Await</h3>
<p>The fourth session of this newspaper's readers' education fund began accepting applications yesterday. We are deeply moved and encouraged by the enthusiastic donations from all sectors. This newspaper has scheduled a special edition on the education fund for the 17th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The plight of students evokes sympathy.  Registration for applications began yesterday. From morning to evening, over a thousand people came to the office to complete the application procedures.  Many were innocent children, thinly dressed, carrying worn-out satchels, enduring tears, waiting to collect registration forms, accounting for six out of ten applicants. This truly fills one with compassion and reinforces the urgency of the education movement. Considering the current balance of the education fund, only over 110,000 yuan remains. Sympathizing with the difficulties of impoverished students, we cannot but place high hopes on the generous donations from all sectors of society. The staff of this newspaper humbly hope to exert all their strength to gather donations. Once collected, we will announce the total amount donated. Even a drop in the bucket is a way to express our sincere wishes. We earnestly hope that all sectors will continue to donate generously to the cause of education.</p>
<p>Heshun Company and others make generous donations.  Yesterday, we received education fund donations from various sectors. Among them, Heshun Company generously donated 5,000 yuan, which is deeply appreciated. The industrial and commercial sectors have consistently supported this newspaper's education movement and will surely rise to the occasion to benefit the students. Furthermore, Mr. Pan Hongyuan came to the office yesterday to subscribe to the newspaper and, witnessing the impoverished students crowding in front of this newspaper's business department to obtain application forms, was moved to compassion and immediately donated 200 yuan. His courageous act of righteousness is commendable. Other individuals also came in person to donate. We thank you on behalf of the impoverished students.</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday.  The total education fund donations received yesterday include 5,000 yuan from Heshun Company, 100 yuan from Pan Hongyuan, 35 yuan from China and Foreign Bank, 20 yuan from Mr. Zheng, 10 yuan from Xu Jieyi, 10 yuan from Cao Xigen, and 10 yuan from Li Shushi, totaling 5,285 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Adding the previous balance of 113,323 yuan and 1 jiao, the total balance is 118,608 yuan and 1 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>Many Letters Received from All Sectors Encouraging Us.  In recent days, we have received numerous letters from various sectors encouraging this newspaper's education fund. The committee members of this newspaper's education fund have also sent insightful articles, either urging us on or making appeals. Many students who have received assistance have also sent letters describing their diligent studies over the past semester, seeking to reassure the donors. We have carefully read all the letters and, although we feel limited by space, we wish to select a portion for publication to the public for their perusal. We have decided to publish a special edition of the fourth education fund in the "Free Talk" section on the 17th (Sunday), including a simple statistical summary of the donation amounts and the number of beneficiaries from the previous three sessions. Furthermore, all expenses for documents, paper, and printing incurred in handling the education fund affairs will be borne by this newspaper. Our staff's travel expenses will also not be reimbursed. All donations, even the smallest amounts, bank interest, will be included in the education fund.</p>

<p>Ciyou Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Impoverished Children. The China Ciyou Association is working under extreme pressure to distribute winter clothing due to the continuous cold weather. Applications for winter clothing are being submitted by families for their children. After verification by the association, over 200 pieces of winter clothing have already been distributed. To ensure that impoverished children receive winter clothing as soon as possible, the association has not only sent staff to various impoverished areas for investigation but has also sent letters to various churches in the city to assist in the process, compiling lists of impoverished children and sending them directly to the association by the 25th of this month for coordinated distribution. The association earnestly hopes that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will pay attention to children in need of winter clothing and assist in applying on their behalf.</p>
<p>Rice Distribution Begins Today in West Shanghai. The West Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, organized by the West Shanghai District Office, has decided to begin distributing rice before the porridge distribution can be arranged. Each person will receive five *ge* (間日施放, every other day), temporarily limited to 1,000 people. The date has been set to begin at 2:00 PM today, distributed every other day for one month at the various West Shanghai neighborhood offices. Details of each location are as follows: No. 53, Lane 476, Youlinan Road; No. 4575, Dunxin Road; Xianghua Temple, Anhe Temple Road; and the Fahua Temple. It is also reported that the committee will also organize porridge and clothing distributions in the near future.</p>
<h3>New Shantytowns After the Jinjia Lane Fire in West Shanghai Are Now Completed</h3>
<p>In late October last year, no fewer than 3,000 impoverished shantytown residents were affected by the major fire in Jinjia Lane, West Shanghai. Reconstruction was initiated by the Buddhist Benevolent Association, with the enthusiastic assistance of charitable individuals from all sectors. It was decided to build 125 tile-roofed bamboo houses. It is reported that all have now been completed and have begun accommodating homeless impoverished people affected by the fire. The completion ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th).</p>

<h3>Factory Restoration News Sparks Rise in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was mostly trending towards new highs.

Shanghai World Book Co. was the most prominent, with its imminent factory restoration. Insiders and those in the cultural and educational sectors were actively buying, pushing the price from 107.5 yuan to a high of 117 yuan. At noon, no shares were sold at 115 yuan, a rise of 7.5 yuan. Zhonghua reached 170 yuan, and Commercial Press reached 450 yuan, each rising 5 yuan. China and Chinese Cement also rose due to news of simultaneous factory restorations. The former soared to 620 yuan, while the latter had buyers at 500 yuan but few sellers. The department store sector was the most stable, with New World Co. rising alone by 1 yuan, while Wing On and Chinese Products remained flat.

Food stocks were flat and weak, with brisk trading.</p>

<h3>4,500 Tons of White Coal Dust Arrive: Spring Rationing Prices Set</h3>
<p>Coal is the main fuel for residents of this city. Currently, stockpiles are ample and arrivals are steady. On the 12th, the Portuguese ship "Pulus" arrived in Shanghai, carrying 4,500 tons of white coal dust, a raw material for making coal balls. It is moored at pontoons 9-10 on the Huangpu River, and unloading began yesterday. It is reported that this is an order for a coal ball factory.</p>
<p>Authorities consider coal as important as rice, oil, sugar, and other daily necessities and strictly enforce the rationing system to suppress the black market and protect people's livelihoods. The Dachung Union Coal Company was established as the central distributor. The company allocates coal monthly to the Coal Industry Association (organized by major coal companies with factories and stockpiles), which then allocates to the Coal Retailers Association for sale to citizens. Prices are also set to ensure legitimate profits, and unauthorized price increases are strictly prohibited. This system has been in place for a year, and coal ball fuel sales have remained within price limits, with coal balls still selling for 25 Central Reserve Bank notes per *dan* (擔, load), plus an additional charge for delivery, benefiting the common people considerably. The authorities have set the prices for Spring rationing of coal per ton (from January to March), detailed below:</p>

<h3>1,305 Bags of Soybeans Ordered</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only soybean cakes saw some trading in the miscellaneous grains market. Transactions in other commodities remained stagnant. Two truckloads of Kaiyuanlong soybean cakes were traded at 96.5 yuan to 96.25 yuan, and one truckload of Feizi soybean cakes was traded at 97 yuan. The market initially rose and then stabilized.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the miscellaneous grains group's broad bean distribution is continuing. Furthermore, it is heard that an order has been placed for 1,305 bags of soybeans, which will soon be loaded and shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Due to the recent insufficient supply of soybeans, the tofu industry in this city is facing imminent suspension of operations. Yesterday, a request was submitted again to the authorities, forwarded to the miscellaneous grains group, to expedite the shipment of soybeans to Shanghai and establish distribution points to benefit people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabric Foothold Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton fabric market remained optimistic due to the firm foothold (脚地) and continued market confidence. However, there were few transactions. White goods, both coarse and fine fabrics, were offered but not sold. Colored goods, such as *Huahua Nv* (花花女) and *Qilin* (麒麟) cloth, were priced at 375 yuan, and *Chuji Shilin* (雏鸡士林) cloth was also sold at the same price. *Sanyang Piqi* (三羊哔叽) was priced at 8 yuan, and *Sijunzi Piqi* (四君子哔叽) red bills rose from 9.1 yuan to a high of 9.35 yuan, with bids at 9.2 yuan at noon. Bank bills were at 9.5 yuan, and spot goods were bid at 9.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Blanks Scarce, Expensive and Sought After</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in 2,000-pound black iron blanks was lively due to demand from local thermos flask factories, printing factories, and machine factories. The inventory of this commodity in Shanghai is low, making procurement difficult for buyers. As a result, dealers with limited inventory are unusually confident, and prices continue to rise. Currently, 2,000-pound bundles of original black iron blanks are selling for 16,000 yuan per bundle, 200-pound goods are selling for 1,600 yuan per case, and retail sales range from 10 yuan to 12 yuan per pound. 20-gauge black iron scrap is 16,000 yuan per ton, and 12 to 14-gauge patterned scrap is quoted at around 14,500 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Hoarders Maintain Prices</h3>
<p>The cigarette market remains strong due to the stimulation of tax increases. As a result, holders are unwilling to sell at reasonable prices to await higher prices. Yesterday, Big Ben was priced at 10,600 yuan, and then rose by 100 yuan. Old Knife was at 9,500 yuan, Pinhai at 7,800 yuan, Fairy at 7,850 yuan, Wuhua at 6,700 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun at 3,200 yuan, Golden Building at 3,700 yuan, Red Rose at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu at 3,400 yuan, 20-Stick at 3,250 yuan, Compass at 2,890 yuan, National Gold Mouse at 4,200 yuan, Beauty at 5,600 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 4,100 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Keep Rising</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities, such as soap, is seeing price increases. Solid "Ben" soap is priced at $620, White "Xiangmao" soap at $980, Yellow "Xiangmao" soap at $530, "Scissors" soap at $600, White "Reiss" candles at $580, and "Monk's Cap" brand at $540. Matchsticks continue to be rationed, with the price remaining at 340 military notes. Therefore, yesterday's quoted prices were $3300 for "Phoenix" brand and $3500 for "Beautiful" brand. The market trend is firm.</p>

<h3>A Record of Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>When speaking of the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the ones who inspire me the most are Prince Yi, Shi Dakai, and Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng. Xiucheng found himself in a suspicious court, bearing the heavy responsibility of the military and the state alone. Externally, he faced strong enemies, and internally, he suffered slander from petty people. In the end, he was able to sacrifice himself for his country and perish with Nanjing. His spirit of loyalty and righteousness is commendable. Compared to Wen Tianxiang's loyalty to the Song Dynasty and Shi Kefa's loyalty to the Ming Dynasty, he is no less worthy. No wonder that after the city fell and he was captured, Zeng Guofan treated him with special courtesy. And when he faced death, the residents of Nanjing set up sacrifices and tens of thousands of households mourned. Liang Qichao once commented on Xiucheng, saying: "Li Xiucheng is truly a hero! At a time of crisis, when the entire city was on the verge of survival, he was still able to command thousands of brave soldiers to break through and fight, nearly annihilating the enemy... And after the city was captured, he was able to save the young prince with his beloved horse and bravely chose to die, with the determination to perish with the state. How can even the great ministers and Confucian generals of ancient times surpass him? Xiang Yu's crows did not fly away, and Wen Tianxiang's lacquer treasure was not effective. Is it fate? Is it human?" After reading these words, I think anyone would shed a tear of admiration for Xiucheng.</p>
<p>Xiucheng initially joined the Taiping army as a mere foot soldier in the front lines. His father was still serving as a cook. It was only after the Taiping captured Yong'an that he was promoted to Er Sima for his merits. Because he was naturally studious and liked to ask for books, he would often read them when he was waiting for dawn with his weapons. This violated the Taiping ban, and he was to be punished. If the Qing army had not captured Yong'an and released him as a prisoner, he might have become an unknown sacrifice under his own steel blade. Not only would his talent and achievements never have been displayed, but the latter half of the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would have been obscure and uninteresting.</p>
<p>When Xiucheng was captured, Zeng Guoquan wanted to imprison him, but Guofan refused, saying: "This man has kept many officials of our dynasty alive. We must not show narrow-mindedness and be ridiculed by others." Therefore, he hosted banquets every day, treating him as a guest with great generosity. This does not show Guofan's generosity, but rather is a powerful illustration of how deeply Xiucheng moved him. The banner of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was to overthrow the Tartars and restore the old ways. Its officials and ministers naturally regarded all Qing officials as enemies without any leniency. However, once Xiucheng had been disarmed, he forbade killing, treating all, whether Manchu officials or Manchu soldiers, equally with courtesy. Among the Taiping generals, besides the magnanimous Shi Dakai, it seems that only Xiucheng could do this. For example, he respectfully buried Wang Youling, the governor of Zhejiang, and the fierce general Zhang Guoliang. He sent personnel to escort Zhang Xigeng, the educational commissioner, Wen Rui, the commander-in-chief, and Lin Fuxiang, the retired provincial administration commissioner, out of the territory, and provided them with travel expenses. He generously treated 50,000 to 60,000 surrendered soldiers in Suzhou, all of which showed his magnanimity. No wonder Liang Qichao praised him for "having the intention of wartime civilized national law." As for Zhao Jingxian being captured and cursing and begging for a quick death, Tan Shaoxi could not bear it and shot him through the chest. Xiucheng even wanted to kill Shaoxi to warn the public, which was even more commendable.</p>
<h3>Second Place in Essay Contest: My Plans for This Year</h3>
<p>— Jia Suixiang</p>
<p>I am already over sixty years old, an old pearl of little value. This is my true situation, so why should I take up a brush and compete with young and middle-aged people in the literary arena? However, "it is never too late to learn," and "how can one know the aspirations of an old man?" These two famous sayings from Wang Zian of ancient times are enough to inspire me. So, when I received this topic, I couldn't help but feel excited. Now, I will briefly write down my plans as my contribution to this year's writing.</p>
<p>A. Plans Regarding Education</p>
<p>(1) Continue Teaching Chinese Literature: I have been teaching Chinese literature at Datong Middle School for nearly thirty years. I have always focused on lectures and dare not be perfunctory in the slightest. Starting this year, I will continue to teach Chinese literature and plan to have students focus on reciting and explaining, so that they can thoroughly understand the meaning of the books. If they can understand Chinese literature, other subjects such as history, geography, biology, and civics can also be solved easily.</p>
<p>(2) Compile Textbooks: Since last year, history textbooks for middle schools have been rarely sold by bookstores, making it difficult to teach history in middle schools. Starting this year, I plan to compile this textbook and have it mimeographed for use in class, so that both teachers and students will be spared the problem of having classes without textbooks.</p>
<p>(3) Supplement Dictionaries: Dictionaries are essential reference books for the study of Chinese culture. The current popular versions, such as "Ciyuan" and "Cihai," still have omissions and deficiencies, making them feel insufficient for use. Starting this year, I plan to collect the terms omitted from the dictionaries, add explanations, and create a supplement to the dictionaries, which may be of some small help for the study of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>B. Plans Regarding Charity</p>
<p>(1) Try My Best to Design: I have been serving as a director of charitable organizations for more than thirty years. I am currently in charge of the design group. Although it costs me food and effort, and I don't seem to have much power, I enjoy it and am willing to do my best to fulfill my obligations. I feel that the most urgent problem that the charitable organization I am currently working for needs to solve is the issue of providing coffins. Now, a coffin costs at least around 200 yuan, which is difficult for charitable organizations to sustain. My design is to request that all roadside corpses be exempt from coffin burials and be directly buried in the ground. This method was implemented five years ago when the burial team was established. If we can follow suit now, the coffin problem can be solved.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage the Donation of Winter Clothing: The most important work of charitable organizations throughout the year is winter relief. Part of the winter relief work is clothing distribution. It is currently the beginning of the year, and it seems too early to talk about clothing distribution since it is still far from the winter relief campaign. However, being prepared is better than digging a well when thirsty. Moreover, purchasing winter clothing in the spring and summer will definitely be cheaper than purchasing it temporarily. I plan to take on this fundraising work and focus on it in the spring and summer, so that donors can be happy to donate clothing at a lower purchase price. This is the idea of ​​merchants stocking up on furs in the summer, so that they can avoid the situation of difficulty in fundraising when winter is approaching and the price of winter clothing rises.</p>
<p>C. Plans Regarding Life</p>
<p>(1) Save on Rice Consumption: My family has no permanent property. Since rice has become expensive, there has been a problem with three meals a day. In recent months, although we have household rice to receive, the ten days' worth of grain we receive is only enough for five days' worth of food. The remaining rice we need to purchase ourselves, and the purchase price is about three times higher than the household rice. This situation is really difficult for me to sustain. Now, in order to save money, I have decided that starting this year, I will cook porridge and rice every day, using half rice and half grains. The price of grains is more expensive than household rice, but cheaper than the rice sold in the market. If we continue to support ourselves in this way, my family of eight may be able to avoid starvation.</p>
<p>(2) Economize on Practical Use: My miscellaneous expenses, which are related to hobbies, such as cigarettes, cost about 50 yuan per month; entertainment, such as watching movies, costs about 20 yuan per month; watching operas costs about 30 yuan per month; and shared meals cost about 40 yuan per month. Now I plan to economize on all of the above four miscellaneous expenses, saving to the point of not spending a single penny. Perhaps my life can be a little more spacious.</p>
<p>(3) Frugally Maintain Marriage Affairs: My fourth daughter will be getting married soon. I have decided to practice frugality in this extraordinary period, not publishing announcements in the newspaper, not distributing [marriage] cakes, and not being extravagant with the dowry or the wedding feast. Everything else will also be based on frugality, so that my life will not be affected in any way.</p>
<p>(4) Run a Store: I am not a capitalist, so I cannot run a business, but raising 1,000 to 2,000 yuan of capital to run a small store is still possible. I will ask my wife to be the assistant manager of this store, specializing in selling several kinds of cooked foods (such as bean porridge, wontons, and zongzi) in order to earn a small profit, so that my life can be slightly subsidized. In the past, Duke Tai sold meals and Zhao Qi sold cakes, which were passed down in books as beautiful stories. My intention to open a small store is to sell meals and cakes. If this plan succeeds, my life problems can also be solved.</p>
<p>(5) Sell Writings: In the past, Sima Xiangru's fu was sold to the Empress of the Han Palace, and Bai Juyi's poems were sold to the merchants of Gyerim. It was common for poor scholars to make a living by selling their writings. In the past, I did not charge for writing for others, but starting this year, for the sake of life, I will set a fixed price, with prose being cheaper and parallel prose being more expensive. Whether it is prefaces, inscriptions, eulogies, poems, lyrics, or couplets, I will charge according to the price list. In this way, I can get some small help with my life.</p>
<p>The above lists a total of three items regarding education plans; a total of two items regarding charitable plans; and a total of five items regarding life plans. In my opinion, it is still easy and simple; in terms of my ability, it is not difficult to implement. However, it is not difficult to say, but it is difficult to do. I don't find it difficult to write this essay, but I find it a bit difficult to put this essay into practice. I hope that things are done by people, and I can work hard to achieve it, so that by the end of the year, forty to fifty percent of my plans can be put into practice.</p>

<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin Tan</p>
<p>But most notable was the transformative work she did on Chips. Before his marriage, he was a dry and somewhat indifferent person; he was liked by the masses at Brookfield and considered a good man, but he was not a person who was very popular and aroused great love. He had been at Brookfield for more than twenty-five years, and the length of time was enough to make him a reasonably good partner, a hard worker; but for too long, no one would believe that he could make any more progress. In fact, he had already begun to decay, and this decay was gradually cultivated by the dry teaching method, which is the worst and last pitfall in this profession; teaching the same lessons every year, life is like a stereotype, and other things fall into this stereotype and adjust themselves, becoming unhurried. He worked well; he was conscientious; he was a service, a satisfaction, a trust, and everything, but he lacked inspiration.</p>
<p>Finally, this surprisingly youthful wife came along, whom no one had expected - especially Chips himself. She made him a new person in the eyes of everyone; although most of this "newness" was just a restoration of warmth and vitality to various things, these various things were aging, confined, and unexpected. There was a light in his eyes; his mind, if not exceptionally prepared in the first place, was certainly properly prepared, and began to move more adventurously. The sense of humor, which he often possessed, also suddenly developed greatly and matured, reducing his age a lot. He began to feel more confident in everything; his discipline improved to a point of not being too strict; he became more popular. When he first came to Brookfield, his goal was to be loved, respected, and obeyed - and to be obeyed anyway. He had indeed obtained obedience, and respect had already been given to him: but love had only come now, which was the students' sudden love for a person who was now amiable, but not weak, and understood them very well, but not too much; his personal happiness and their happiness were linked together.

<h3>Art Exhibition Opens to Benefit the Poor: Porcelain Exhibition Tickets Donated to Poverty Relief Fund</h3>
<p>Mr. Dai Runzhai, the owner of Haitianlou in Liangxi, has been studying Chinese porcelain for more than twenty years. His collection is rich and his appraisal is accurate. In the spirit of making art public, he has put his lifelong collection of famous porcelain from the Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties on display at the Majestic Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, sharing it with enthusiasts. He has also donated all the ticket proceeds, totaling 1,044 yuan in national currency, to the newspaper's poverty relief fund to benefit the poor, which is especially commendable. In addition to depositing the funds, we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Dai.</p>
<h3>Shuping Scholarship Enrollment</h3>
<p>The Shuping Public Scholarship Fund Committee has been running scholarships for poor students in high school and junior high school for six terms, and more than 400 students have received awards. The seventh term exam is now being held. All poor middle school students with excellent academic performance and a score of 85 or above in the last major exam, and who have been formally certified by the school, can register for the exam. The registration deadline is the 26th of this month. It is also heard that the committee has a medical service center, with specially hired Chinese and Western doctors, and specially contracted Chinese medicine stores and Western pharmacies. In addition to subsidizing the medical expenses of students in Shuping Obligation Primary School and students who have received Shuping Public High School and Junior High School Scholarships, it also provides medical services to poor teachers in primary and secondary schools. All current teachers in public and private primary and secondary schools in this city who have graduated from normal schools, senior high schools, or universities, have served for more than two years, and whose monthly salary is less than 300 yuan, and whose families are poor, can apply for medical assistance. The application deadline is the end of February. Scholarship and medical service regulations, application forms, etc., can be requested by mail from Room 301, No. 121 Beijing Road. Personal consultations are not valid.</p>
