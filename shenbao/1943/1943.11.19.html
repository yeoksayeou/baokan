<h3 id="c1">公敎人員之最低生活 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自物價畸形飛漲以來，固然產生了若干暴發戶，可是大多數的羣衆都感到難以聊生，其中尤以公教人員之生活最爲悲慘。幸而此種現象已引起社會上一般人士之注意，莫不大聲疾呼「提高公教人員之待遇』。姑不論其提高之程度如何，但就此所表現之「人類同情心」，巳値得珍視與讚美了。不過談到提高待遇問題之時，每日「至少限度，應維持公教人員之最低生活。」然則公教人員最低生活之限度何若？勢不能不先加以說明，以冀提高待遇適合此標準。</p>
<p>在說明本問題之前，還須先提供下列兩條答案：　何以公教人員之生活値得社會一般人士之注意？因公教人員爲社會中之中堅分子，其工作之效能，足以影響目前政令之推行以及社會上任何事業之發展，甚而至於影響到十年百年以後整個社會之命運。　公教人員之生活與一般羣衆之生活異點何在？一般羣衆所受之教育水準較低，每「爲生活而工作」，苟能保持溫飽，於願巳足而樂其所業。至於公教人員肌不然，論其社會上之地位未必過高，若論其教育水準均屬中上階級，其中固有自甘暴棄之流，然究屬少數，而大都『以工作爲生活』苟不能使其具備工作上之最低條件，即未能維持其最低生活。</p>
<p>就上述之兩項觀之，可知公教人員之工作，不屬於直接生產，更不屬於私人謀利，故不能不就其所受之待遇，以滿足共最低之生活—工作上必備之條件，以期公教人員樂於爲廣大的人羣以及未來的社會服務，母怠母荒，完成此神聖之使命。此外，更須顧及公教人員之工作每非勞力方面而屬於精神方面，故於仰事俯蓄之餘尚須保持其個人精神之健康。於是始可論公教人員之最低生活。</p>
<p>（甲）就衣方面言，固可衣敝　袍不恥與狐貉者並立，然於七十二賢中，亦僅其由也歟，且整其衣冠君子不廢，服以章身，此亦修養於中而形於外者。錦繡文羅原可無需，而整齊淸潔所欲未奢。（乙）就食方面言，除飽而外亦須顧及營養，以配合樂體力上與夫腦力上之需要。就食之廣義上言，尚有所謂精神食糧，若終年不能進益，其痛苦或有甚於　腹者。（丙）就住方面言，在目前衣食問題固己不易解決，然欲解決住的問題實有難若上靑天之感·雖無統計之數字可憑，然公教人員中身爲三房客者必佔多數，此爲無疑之事實。縱法律有明文保障，然忍受痛苦而無告者未必因此而减少。益以侷處斗室，坐立不寧，左有呼么喝六之喧駡，右有苯衣頓足之啼號，倘本身復有兒女成行，則求片刻之安靜尚不可得，還論寫讀之工作，此業餘之寫讀適爲公教人員怡情悅性之正常途徑，或且爲其一身事業之重要部分，山是褫奪無餘。猖謹者忍無可洩以致頹喪萎頓，狂妄者不能不別謀消遺無所不爲。若言遷地爲良，則動輒數十萬金，終其身未必能積，惟有放棄而巳·（丁）就行方面言，自行車固風行一時，亦非所有公教人員各能自備，公用交通又未能盡符公用之原則，乘坐者正以公教人員爲多數，費錢費時之告，必有不可勝言而限未精神上之負擔。（　）其他如歲時酬　嫁娶病疾以至養生送死爲人生所不免者，雖典質借貸亦無以免捉襟見肘，無非分散其神思，消耗其精力，使其一腔服務羣衆之熱血枯竭而後己，又誰哀之。</p>
<p>以上所謂，初未表以數字，然亦足以見目前所謂『維持公教人員之最低生活』，與事實相去遠苦。非常時期孰敢奢望，但反觀奇裝體服未以此而减，一食萬金毫無吝色者亦大有人在，大厦崇樓，甚有所謂麻將間等等者，亦非絕無僅有，然則獨責公教人員以節約，務使其不能工作不能生活，猶復實之以最崇高使命，此吾人之所以不能巳於呼籲者。</p>

<p>東條首相致辭</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭乃自英美之壓迫下解放，東亞且貢獻於世界和平，　古聖戰其目的在擊碎英美，使東亞爲彼等殖民地之野心，立足於道義，確立萬邦共榮偕樂之大東亞，此偉業巳着着實現。大東亞各國家各民族均情同兄弟，向共同之理想邁進，　於東京舉行大東亞會議時，曾發表大東亞共同宣言，該宣言即爲吾等共同崇高之目標，幷表明達成此目標之堅固決意。此次又召開大東亞新聞大會今後將闡揚完成大東亞建設之決意，幷展開實現大東亞宣言之積極活動，此洵堪同慶。仇敵英美於諸戰中慘敗，其後乃於武力戰及宣傳　略戰中，用盡一切手段拼命反攻，此斷不容吾人忽視。對於敵人之武力反攻，須斷然予以擊碎，於必要時加以澈底痛擊，於另一方面加强大東亞十億民衆之團結，進而對世界宣布我等公正之戰爭目的，俾期於思想戰中亦獲得勝利，此即爭取最後勝利達成大東亞共同目標之秘訣。今後期待於諸君者至重且大，要之在使大東亞各民族充分理解大東亞共同宣言中所聞明建設大東亞之根本方針，全體一致邁進，達成此共同理想，進而謀使之普及於全世界，余相信各位必可達成此偉大使命。</p>
<p>中國代表答辭</p>
<p>東條首相閣下，在東亞爭取解放的時代，閣下就任首相，從事對英美的決戰，將及兩年的大東亞戰爭，將英美侵略勢力逐出東亞境外，確立必勝態勢，奠定大東亞建設的基礎，最近前方捷報更如雪片傳來，我們於衷心欣慰之餘，謹先表示無限的敬意。一月卅日中日盟約簽訂，本月五日更有大東亞會議的召開，而具有歷史性的劃時代的大東亞宣言，巳成爲東亞解放運動的基石。這不但使中日關係更趨緊密，東亞共榮團內各民族，也得以遂共本然的顧望，我們於敬佩之餘，更願向首相閣下表示衷心的謝意。首相閣下名滿東亞，造成今日軍政兩方面的偉業，我們不但爲日本欣幸，且爲東亞欣幸。此次我們參加大東亞新聞大會，到東京來目睹戰時體制下的日本各種情况，深知前方的轉移，決非偶然，使我們對於戰爭勝利的信念更加堅定，我們決盡我們的本分，團結一致，爲完遂戰爭而努力。</p>

<p>日本代表演辭</p>
<p>中央社十八日東京電大東亞新開大會，十八日爲第二日，日本代表緒方竹虎氏於大會席上發表演說，要旨如次；新開的使命，和其國家的目的是相同的，現在也只是在爲戰爭，爲了完成擊滅英美的戰爭，必須發揮他的全能力，現在的戰爭本是聖戰，決沒有妥協的可能，當此戰爭正在互爭勝負之際，大東亞新聲界毅然奮起，可以說正逢其時。</p>
<p>大東亞憲章　大東亞會議已經在東京舉行竣事，大會中已發表了共同宣言，大東亞共同宣言可以說是曠古罕有的大憲章，大東亞新聞大會的目的，在使大東亞十億民衆徹底瞭解這次使世界史一新的共同宣言爲主點，大東亞新聞大會可稱爲在歷史上空前未有的大會。現代新開界人必須特別認識自己的力量，晚近以來各國新開界多傾向於商業主義，因此新聞本身失去其自信和矜持，是無可諱言的。當此新聞界正處於萎靡的時候，日本新聞界自身倔起反省，擺脫了過去陳腐去汨：公佈新聞體制，恢復了天下爲公的立塲，全國五十餘種新聞報紙，現正從事於擊滅英美的思想戰。欲要實踐大東亞共同宣言，必須以戰爭勝利爲前提，</p>
<p>新聞界使命</p>
<p>如果不能勝利，那麼大東亞憲章也不能存在，因此現在新聞的使命，在徹底昂揚大東亞理想，同時也應當先本着這種理想而戰。吾人必須獲騰，而且勝利的方法，是只要大東亞各國家各民族　於後方鞏固團結，亳不動搖必勝的信念便可成功。波根維爾島之戰，澈底覆滅了漸度恢復調整的英美艦隊：預料今後還要獲得赫赫戰果，戰塲上的歸趨，毫不足危懼，最後所見者唯有一致團結，粉碎敵人的謀略，當此邁進勝利前途的時候，願以以上數語提醒諸君，共同來佈置我們思想陣綫。</p>
<p>中國代表演辭</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電大東亞新聞大會席上中華民國代表團團長許力求氏發表演說，要旨如次：今天在這一個盛大的集會中，全東亞第四戰綫的鬥士共叙一室，商討如何協力大東亞戰爭的方策。中華民國代表團得參加這個盛會，衷心實在感到萬分的興奮。記得大東亞戰爭勃發之前四個月，國民政府宜傳部曾經在廣州主辦過第一屆東亞新聞記者大會，當時主要的議題，是怎樣建股大東亞共榮圈。在那個時候國民政府還都不過一年多，中國人民所努力以求其貿現的，是中日和平中日合作。所謂中日和平合作，自和平運動最初發動的時候，我們的解釋就不僅是求兩個國家的因戰而和，不僅是求兩國外交上的邦交敦睦，我們要邁進的最大的目標。是在實現　國父孫先生的大亞洲主義。我們的見解以爲中日和平的基礎，是要建設在崇高偉大的目標上的，中日兩國之所要和平，並不是圖爲利害的關係，而是要爲了東亞大局而負起責任，是要建設東亞新秩序而共存共榮</p>
<p>中日和平合作</p>
<p>繼承國父遺志盟邦日本屢次聲明中最使我們感奮的，是日本要求中國之興隆，以共同負担建設東亞新秩序的責任。百年以來中國人民在舊秩序之下，受盡了英美的侵略，中國被侵略對東亞是一個重大的危機，對日本是一種威脅。國父孫先生早就看透了這三點，所以他在政組中國國民黨的時候，同時提出了廢除不平等條約的主張。怎樣廢除不平等條約呢，國父孫先生定下了兩個網要，一是喚起民衆，一是聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥。所謂聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，國父所期待的是日本，他在『中國存亡問題』中講得很明白，在他扶病北上的時候，特意要取道日本，發表兩次重要的演講，共一是日本應援助中國廢除不平等條約，又其一是大亞洲主義。前者明白說出中國對日本的期待，後者更指出東亞的危機，惟有中日提携合作，纔有解救的希望。在大亞洲主義中他所提出的，是亞洲民族獨立遝動，是以東方的王道文化，打倒四方的霸道文化。他對神戶的新聞記者發表談話更說得懇切，他說明治維新是中國革命的第一步，中國革命是明洽維新的第二步，又說希望日本勿忘過去受侵略的痛苦，而援助中國解除痛苦。孫先生是曾經習醫的，他的病如何危險，他自己必然是明白，他特意要取道日本以赴北京，我們現在想起來，這其間含有很深的意義。</p>
<p>爲復興大東亞</p>
<p>一致努力奮鬥但和平運動的基礎中日合作目標早在此時確定了，孫先生逝世以後，我們同志爲繼承遺志而奮鬥，然而英美侵略主義者也變本加厲，挑撥離問無所不用其極，幸而盟邦日本對於中國不惜多方援助，以求中國政府之强化。中國人民對於日本除了衷心感謝之外，更覺得日本對中國的援助，無異是對中國一種鞭策，在得到了援助之後，惟有加緊努力，以完成　國父的遺志。所以大東亞戰爭勃發之後。國民政府立刻宣告與盟邦日本同甘共苦，本年一月九日更以同生共死的決意，參加大東亞戰爭爲戰鬥中的一員。最近中日盟約簽訂大東亞宣言發表，而盟邦日本前綫將士又獲得偉大勝利，這一切都證明了東亞大局已經明期，勝利已經來臨，復興東亞建設東亞之時機已成熟。我們的敵人是英美，在盟邦前綫將士英勇壯鬥，在菜亞民族一致努力之下，英美除了崩潰以外別無他途，這是我們所確信的。現在戰爭巳到了決戰的階段，我們必須展開全面的鬥爭，戰爭的決勝固然巳有精銳的軍隊，優秀的武器，豐富的物資，尤其要使整個東亞民族對英美侵略主義有敵愾同仇的戰意。我們必須要和英美展開思想戰，而這巳是我們新聞界同志們的責任。我們第四戰錢的同志，須要一致動員團結起來，爲完遂戰爭實現大東亞宣言而努力奮鬥</p>
<p>滿國代表演辭</p>
<p>滿洲國代表李雅森氏演說，題爲「在大東亞建設上新聞的使命」，大東亞建設隨大東亞戰爭的進展着着前進，我滿洲帝國爲大東亞共榮　之一環，榮　鎭護北邊之重任，且爲大東亞之兵站基地，於今官民四千三百萬衆莫不蓄志完途聖戰，我等肩荷這樣光榮使命的滿洲國，從事報道任務的人亟欲聊盡棉薄者約有以下數端：</p>
<p>担負鎭北重任</p>
<p>防杜細菌侵入　「徹底認識戰爭目的」近代戰爭爲總力戰，思想戰的比重也隨武力戰的進展而愈加重，敵方英美的謀略戰是無所不用其極的，我滿洲國民無論敵方的謀略如何，由於堅固的信念與其體騐，絲毫不能爲之而動，但吾人須時時防備英美乘機散布其謀略細首，同時對於防遏共產思想使入，要不斷的有所防備。　「徹底認識鎭北之實情」滿洲國位於大東亞共榮圈的北端，可以說是共榮圈北方的邊境，那裹有日滿軍嚴加防守，鞏如磐石，滿洲國全國國民徹底認識這樣鎭護北邊的情形，更使盟邦諸國國民也徹底認識現在的姿態，這是我們的重大使命。同時滿洲國民巳整備萬全的態勢，無論何時遇如何事態臨頭，都能立刻應付下去，這是我們切實的問題，要向大家提到的一兵站基地的認識。</p>
<p>亞洲是家理想</p>
<p>協力促其實現滿洲國是世界的穀倉地帶，滿洲的眞面目，隨戰爭進展而發揚起來，尤其在今日情勢之下，能以對盟邦日本有所貢獻，並以食糧供給接壤地帶者只有滿洲國而巳。滿洲國目下開辦的農產物，蒐集工作巳將「一般增產二成開拓地增產七成」的成績事實表示出來，這一者還表示滿洲有進一步更對戰爭有所貢獻的旺盛意志。　「徹底認識南北不可分性」大東亞建設，南北有不可分的連帶關係，北方建設促進南方建設，南北建設也促進北方建設，更要把握其實體，而再進一步從事足進。總之，大東亞戰爭下，我等言論界的使命，隨戰爭進展而一天比一天加重起來，在思想戰上，也要像在武力戰上確立必勝不敗的態勢，一面整飭必勝的陣營。滿洲建國以來，英美或陰行策動，或陽事阻撓，只要一看滿洲國十餘年的歷史，即可洞如觀火。東亞先覺者，所謂「亞洲是家」，這句話現在巳經成爲另行作戰的原理，希望言論界人努力促進實現這個理想。</p>
<p>泰國代表演辭</p>
<p>泰國代表塞馬尼爾演說要旨如次：在總力戰下，從事戰爭者非僅前統將士，即後方國民亦應同一決心協力作戰。在新聞方面，其責任在協力政府，促全國國民之團結，全力援助前綫作戰之將士。而其重大任務，在使國家與國家間增深其友好與理解。泰國國民於此，對於日本新開界爲促進兩國之理解與親善而努力，襟表深切之感謝。泰國新聞界亦與日本新聞界同樣爲促進日泰兩國友好關係，不斷作積極之努力。爲同一理想同一目的而奮鬥之大東亞新聞界同志，得藉此大會而聚於同堂，爲大東亞共同利益各項問題開誠交換意見，來分担建殷大東亞新秩序之責任，實爲欣快。</p>
<p>緬甸代表演辭</p>
<p>緬甸代表特文丹演說要旨如次：大東亞新聞界向未有如此次會議之重要集會，此次大東亞新聞大會實有重大意義，敝人茲以緬甸國代表資格報告一事，即緬甸國刻正在大東亞之西部戰綫盡其職責，緬旬國正如一後哨立於大東亞之門前，緬甸國民皆　顧對完成戰爭以全面的協力。以下兩點，即可證明緬甸國爲可以信賴之國家，第一爲巴莫博士，在巴莫博士指導下，國民皆毫無畏懼致力聖戰，第二爲緬甸新聞事業之活　發展，刻緬甸新聞界正呼應國內戰時態勢，致力完成其使命，以期不負諸位之信賴·</p>
<p>菲國代表演辭</p>
<p>菲島代表伊加土亞諾演說要旨如次：大東亞共榮團乃係一極大之隣組，東亞共榮圈係各國家民族所構成，日本爲其組長。菲律賓在地理上民族上以及文化上而言，實應爲偉大新亞洲之一環，所能貢獻於大東亞共榮　者有二，一爲物資方面，二爲文化方面。菲律賓之自然資源，誠屬天惠，人口僅一千八百萬，而物資實足以供應其四倍人口之需求，農產木材魚產均極豐富而　產尤爲富饒，石炭牧畜業亦甚發達，以大東亞隣組之精神，常適應團內各國家民族之需求，將葬島產物充分加以提供，菲島在文化方面上之貢獻亦堪期待，菲島國民刻已決心支援大東亞各國排除阻害共榮圈團結之外國勢力，從事獨立菲律賓共和國之建設。菲島新聞實負有極大之任務，吾人相信以大東亞經濟圈內最豐饒最龐大之資源，以及以誠實尊敬信義等精神理想相處，則不但大東亞共榮　之將來希望無窮，且能將此種理想普及於全世界，進而建造四海皆兄弟之世界。</p>

<p>中央社訊　反軸心國於摩諾島海戰及先、後五次波根維爾島海空戰等役，遭受致命打擊，但彼等力圖諱飾事實，惟至第五次波根維爾空戰，遂致無法再事掩飾，由敵方通訊社發表事實，關於此事上海日大使館廣田情報課畏說明敵方不得再事應瞞之原因，並暴露美國國內對羅斯羅指導作戰深表不滿之情形。</p>
<p>空戰敗績終於暴露</p>
<p>廣田課長稱：十月於甩獲戰果，　向日本大本營詳細發表，敵方戰艦四艘，航空母艦六艘，巡洋艦十餘艘，及其他多數艦船，悉沉沒於圍太平洋海底，然敵方無論政府當局，或通訊社方竊　秘事實，不作任何報道，　如美海長諾充斯於十一月九日接見新聞記者時稱：日方報道全屬　　虛搆去，又美國太平洋艦隊司令米尼茲提督，於十二日之廣播中，亦否認其敗續，同日太平洋反軸必司令部發言人麥克沃塞亦予否認，報稱軍艦未曾喪失一艘，惟十七日美方通訊社突將日本大水營公布之弟五次波　　爾島空戰戰報完全透露，蓋全世界固案知日本大本瞥所公布者最爲正　，敵方通倍社對日方公布者無任何評語，但彼等此次無法隱瞞而予報道，此點殊值注意。</p>
<p>深恐引起國內動搖</p>
<p>八度撮測彼等所以不得不　飾日本戰果之理由固極易明瞭之事，第一彼等如將空前敗結公諸國民之前，則對批評日劣之羅斯福政權之批評，更將孤劣，並引起國內動搖，此極屬明　之事，在美國之內，對於羅斯福之戰爭政策批評恶劣，到處可見，此稱事實，茲舉其最大者言之，例如十一月三日發表之美國選舉結果，細該次選舉，紐約州新　因州知事，及弗列得爾菲亞市長等重要地城，勝利全歸共和黨，羅斯福及民主黨供吿慘敗，因此美國四十八州知事中共和黨占二十五名，民主黨二十三名，竊斯福之反對黨巳居首位，羅斯禂對於選舉滅，再舉一例，即十一月初解決之煤礦工人罷工風潮之結果，於此表示在美國聯合煤礦業公會會長路易士與內長伊東斯間締結之協定中，羅斯福政權對勞工不得福信仰　淡，此時若使國民獲悉敗績，則更為羅政權之致命傷，故不得不隱瞞，此爲任何人所不能否認者。</p>
<p>羅斯福政第無好評</p>
<p>但此次海空作戰，並不認為偶然遭邁，恐彼等旱巳企圖　極反攻南太平洋之日軍陣地，但在計劃實行中途遭此大收，故彼等在進行作戰時，對此敗績予以掩飾，但至今無法隱瞞，遂命令通僧社發表其敗績。若論彼等為何採取積極作戰，擺測其原因，其一纏羅斯福政權遭選舉及罷工兩事之慘敗，且人民對其戰爭政策一無好評，若　明年第四屆總統遭舉時，則民主黨之失敗　料中事，故此時　有一舉而得大戰果，舊以挽回羅斯福本身及民主黨名聲之必要·彼等對日本不使有充裕時間·可以　定，因深恐日本　日益强盛遂計劃念進作戰，企圖奪取拉巴爾·關於此事可在太平洋艦隊司令尼米茲在十二日之廣播中看出，彼稱：「吾人已至對日實施之時，今後將使日軍無休息之時」云，又十一月九日英國邱吉爾首相在倫敦市長官邸發表演說中，渠亦調：「一九四四年戰爭將　最高潮，該年為不可思議之時運·蓋該年為美國選舉之年」云，即由上項事實而觀，亦可明瞭羅斯福為挽同人心，不得不在軍事上政治上探取積極作戰，但是每次攻擊無不慘遭敗北</p>
<p>軸心作戰一大勝利</p>
<p>此不但於日本，對於轉心國全體，亦為作戰途上之一大勝利，今後更可明瞭此種敵方慘敗之結果，首先表現於印度英軍之發表，蓋十一月于五日英國印度軍總司令歐辛萊克將軍，在印度樞密院聲稱：「從印度奪囘緬甸之作戰，暫時不得不展期，、在新銳部隊及新武器未運抵以前，攻擊緬甸無法實行，在目前猶不能運料對付日本能否成功。」又東南亞洲反軸心軍司令蒙特巴登提督，會於十七日稱；對日本之大攻勢，在最近之將來因種種關係，無實現希望云，彼所指種種關係中，飛行基地之關如，亦其中之一，且從即度攻擊緬甸，必須大量運輸船及護送艦隊，但該項艦隊業在此次彼根維爾海空戰中喪失無餘，固為任何人能保證者，又此次海戰中英國艦隊雖未參加，但欲補足英艦隊劃出一部份，故緬甸攻勢暫時不得巳展緩，此種解釋似不無理由，且被等在地中海亦需要艦船，故可見南太平洋方面此次敗北，使反　心之全體戰局，失去時機，彼等今後將趕緊造船，以圖與日交戰，但徒供日本海軍拙毁，無論何時，將不能完成力量足以攻擊日本之大艦隊，業已洞悉第五次波根維爾島空戰結果之英美國民，當更將探求第一第二三四次空戰結果，該時對今日海空戰之結果，表現更將深霸矣。</p>

<p>近閱第四十五期「企業週刋」所　載之「本年上半期日本五火銀行的營業」一文（原文載九月十一日東洋經濟新報），不禁感覺戰時銀仃業　的向上，實在不是偶然的。日本五大銀行——帝國，三菱，安田，住友，三和——今年上半期的綜合純盎金逮四千五百七十六萬圓之多，比前期又復增加三百六十七萬八千圓；稽其　績甩以突飛猛晋的原　，不外兩種：其一，由於各太銀行合併之後，（三井銀行和第一銀行合併設立帝國銀行，三養吸收第百銀行，安田吸收日本畫夜銀行），遂使銀行業務由於經營合理化而向前進展，進出資金數額念激膨脹；其次，亦即為基木原因，則由於本年產衆實金對時局重要產業的通融，大見增加之故。「依照各行決算書綜合看來，存欵貸欵的增加，尤以貸飲之急敎增加，為近來所罕見」，並且，因為對時局產業的放款仍當織續，故預料今後日本各大銀行的業績，大致仍　　續順利。</p>
<p>基於上述一節，可知今後要徒銀行業績向上，必須遵循爾條要遺：一為經營合理化，其關鍵在於銀行業務之兼併，一為調劑金融市面，其關鍵在於產業貸款之增加。日前會論公司銀行樂務之兼併，我們感覺與其斤斤於資金不足額，組　不健全的銀行趕辮增資，何如致力於它們業務的兼併。至以調劑金融市面而言，近悉銀行聯合準備委員食暨錢業聯合準備庫，在銀錢業竭公會所　放欵新辦法之限制下，對於各業正當用途，如發展生產事業，收買變產品原料等，經審查合格後即予貸款，這當然是關心溝通金融資本與產業資本者所樂聞的。</p>

<p>國府糧食部長顧實衡氏最近會發表談話謂：米穀集配業務　移交於商統會辦理　糧食部今後之任務，在推進增產運動，盡力解決戰時糧食問題，此種有決心的表明，頗堪注目。</p>
<p>顧部長對於糧食部增產施策，採用如下方法，即生產面積之擴大，優良品種之普及，全面增產之重視，　節農塲之經營，病蟲害之驅除，耕種方法之改良等等，已包括金部計劃，如何將此項施策之重點，具體的展關，甚為重要，亦為增產運動之必須條件，非加以强調不可。在國府統治下，過去數年之間，大體均趨向於增產之一途，研究其增產原因，主要在食糧價格之　貴，農民樂於耕種，但此項增產原因，今後是否能繼續維持，實無保障，如果此項原因一旦消失，則應用何種方法去刺激農民增產，實為增產運動當前重大問題之一。</p>
<p>由於食糧的統制　買，米麥最高價格業巳訂定如果與每日　貫的日用品價格相比，米麥尚見低　，因為此種理由，即日用品之價格高昂，農民將趨向於自給經濟，而减少增產的意向，申言之，農民所出賣之農產品為公定價格，而農民所需要買進之物品，則為黑市價格，在品生產的農業，而形成自給自足的態勢，其理至明，欲補救農民自給自足的傾向，刺激其向增產之途邁進，則日用品及肥料等等，亦須確實以公定價格，充分配給於農民，使無所缺，此雖爲糧食部管理以外之問題，但旣然在論增產，却亦未可等閒視之。</p>
<p>不用說，增產運動之强力推進，需要　太之經費，此項經費，自應由國庫負担，因爲增產運動，實爲戰時經濟至上命令的緣故，如果國庫感覺困難，由米統會支付亦可，米統會酌收費用，似亦爲當然之事，希望當局熱烈推進此項增產運動，中日民衆，亦望積極的協助，以使踏上邁進之途！（譯自十一月十七日大陸新報）</p>

<p>無吿的孩兒</p>
<p>新橋街婦孺敎濱總會收容着一百九十七名苦難無告的孩子，分為幼稚　和男院兩部。男孩在九歲以下，女孩在十三歲以下的，都被編入幼稚園，現在共有四十九名（女孩四十名），進行幼稚園的敎養，看吧，在這蓋有玻璃頂棚的天井裏，排列着古角粗笨而發黑了的長桌長　，幾十個衣衫破爛面黃肌瘦的孩子在「自條」呢。一個六七歲的小女孩，瘦弱的幾乎站立不住，在　着桌子的邊緣移動，可憐的小骨頭的乎響從靑白色的皮　穿出來，有幾個却幌着頂開「白色之花」的腦袋，在四躍和追逐着。擔任敎戰的張惠元先生說，這些小孩多數是馬路的流浪兒，小乞丐，進會尙多已患有重病，所以死亡率很驚人，會　　於　　、　有滿足孩子們　　的　　要求，　　不　必要的衣　、　用不起什麽學校舉難的保緝和實於　　　　的駐院　　，當然玩具　娛樂，孩子們也許連做夢也不　　　咧。</p>
<p>廳和開着大　門的天井裏。喧　着一　羣的男孩子，互相追逐與跳躍的有，互相吵鬧以至　　的有，埋頭在書本上面的或伏首　書桌上似乎在　鏟的也有，大廳的左邊，五六排長桌和長板凳，比較整齊地　集着數十個學生，在　　地讀書，敎師提起精神，用勁地唸着，本上的國語文句，學生們一齊一句句的隨聲　誦，令人囘　起兒時在私熟苦讀的情形，不過敎師不像私熟老夫子那裏高踞　壇，而是忙碌地奔走於各課桌之間，熱心地２問學生對放　敎是否了解。下課了，級　出來揩抹黑板，教師又得　集別的幾班學生加以敎導了，喉嚨也有點啞了的樣子，可見其辛勞的　度了。</p>
<p>張惠元先生說，這就是男院，收容九歲以上無家可歸的苦難兒童，現有實數共達一百四十八名。每天依照普通小學的編制和　　，　行敎育，分　　六艘，自初小一年級起或高小六年級止，所用　本，完全　　　完全小學一樣。不過由於敎職員不是，當然不能像一般學校那樣有完整的管敎　　。這是一個很大的間題。　　的半工半讀制度，也因為　於經費和人材而未能施行，更是可惜。</p>
<p>是的，普通學科之外，該會男院在敎學上特別注意於音樂一科。每星期一，三，五三天的下午，完全上音樂課，原來　們還特別組織有一個音樂隊理。據說現在訓陳　熟　技　　的隊員約有三十名，由朱關生為領導，經當接受各界婚　與禮的召　，因為孩子們的造詣深，服　　皇，樂器完備，所以頗　歡迎，每月有好幾千兌的收入，用以補助該會呢。</p>
<p>除子幼稚轅和男院以　。這裏還收容着各慈善機關送來無告無歸的難民等等，也有四十五名之多，加上　工三十一人，這裏總人數共據二百六十八名，每天只吃二次，經常是一粥一飯，然而由於經　困難，所謂飯，固然已經攙入各種粗糧，所謂粥，更說不上是否足夠營簽了，近來常常吃「　　　，實際上却像是　　　　的擊糊，混　　　　　而已。營養不足，衣　不夠，疾病自然　　　　。還好，說　　，　　平　醫院是特　免費的，　　給，而中醫張永漢先生還　常前往　視。町是，消極性的　劉末」之策，何　積極的「治本」</p>
<p>囘首該會大門上招領兒　的一大　照　集。使人永遠　　鬥　一　苦　的小羔羊和辛勞痛苦的「牧羊　」。</p>
<p>得救的女性</p>
<p>從中國救　網　總會出來，趕上向西北行的三路電車，到　閘路成都路下　，　入北成　路　條相當寬閘的碎石街，走不上二百步，靠左邊一幢　色的　子，就是該會　在的婦女留養院。雖然和老入院與什　學校合住，可是一進門，就給人以　　與整齊的良好印象，顯出辦事人員的勤勉。天井裹，一個難婦正在辛苦的打掃呢。</p>
<p>主任陳石金琳，一位和謁而幹練的女士，在忙着工作，照顧　　，又照　那裏。她說，現在收容十四歲以上的苦難女子共　一百七十三名，份子　常　　，大都份是街頭的　　女兒，被拐　獲救而　句　　的受　　女，不　　得而逃亡的　女，養女，童養媳，小妾以全不願　　肉體買賣供人蹂　的妓女等　，此外。　　迷途的婦女等等，不少是由創工部局，各慈善團，以及各界善士送去的苦難女性。</p>
<p>這　苦難的女性，來自不同　地區和階層，　有不同的性格與資質，　了一部份由救濟總會幼稚團至十三歲以上送入女院的以外，大多數未受適當的敎育，還有不少是文肓，而且她們過去的生活状態，更是形形式式，絕無規律，所以　人救濟會之」，無衣無食，無依無靠，得不到一點人類互助互愛的慰安，所以，一進救濟會，對會方的盡心救助，不會沒有感激之心，第一次感到人類的熱愛。對於同被救助的難女，「相達何必曾相織，而是大涯淪落人」，更有同病相憐的特殊友誼，於是，教濟會內婦女的生活，構成　愛互助的生活。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Minimum Living Standard for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the abnormal surge in prices, while some have become newly rich, most people find it difficult to make a living. Among them, the lives of public school teachers and civil servants are the most miserable. Fortunately, this phenomenon has attracted the attention of the general public, who are all calling loudly for "raising the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants." Regardless of the extent of the increase, the "human compassion" shown is worth cherishing and praising. However, when it comes to raising salaries, the daily "minimum limit should be to maintain the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants." Then, what is the minimum living standard for public school teachers and civil servants? It is necessary to explain it first, in order to make the salary increase suitable for this standard.</p>
<p>Before explaining this issue, it is necessary to provide the following two answers: Why is the livelihood of public school teachers and civil servants worthy of attention from the general public? Because public school teachers and civil servants are the backbone of society, and the effectiveness of their work is enough to affect the implementation of current policies and the development of any undertaking in society, and even affect the fate of the entire society ten or a hundred years later. What is the difference between the lives of public school teachers and civil servants and the lives of the general public? The general public has a lower level of education, and "works for a living." If they can maintain warmth and sustenance, they are satisfied and enjoy their work. However, public school teachers and civil servants are not like this. Their social status may not be too high, but their education level is above the middle class. Among them, there are those who are willing to give up on themselves, but they are ultimately in the minority, and most of them "take work as life." If they cannot be provided with the minimum conditions for work, they cannot maintain their minimum living standard.</p>
<p>From the above two perspectives, it can be seen that the work of public school teachers and civil servants does not belong to direct production, nor does it belong to private profit-making. Therefore, it is necessary to use their treatment to meet their minimum living—the necessary conditions for work—so that public school teachers and civil servants are happy to serve the vast population and the future society, without being lazy or negligent, and complete this sacred mission. In addition, it is also necessary to consider that the work of public school teachers and civil servants is often not physical but mental, so in addition to supporting their families, they must also maintain their personal mental health. Only then can the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants be discussed.</p>
<p>(A) In terms of clothing, it is true that one can wear tattered robes without being ashamed to stand with those in fur coats. However, among the seventy-two sages, it was only Zilu who did so. Moreover, tidying up one's clothes and hats is something gentlemen do not neglect; clothing is used to show one's status. This is also cultivating oneself internally and expressing it externally. There is no need for brocade and silk, but neatness and cleanliness are not extravagant desires. (B) In terms of food, in addition to being full, one must also consider nutrition to meet the needs of physical and mental strength. In the broad sense of food, there is also the so-called spiritual food. If one cannot improve throughout the year, the pain may be greater than hunger. (C) In terms of housing, it is already difficult to solve the problem of clothing and food, but solving the problem of housing is like ascending to the blue sky. Although there are no statistics to rely on, it is undoubtedly a fact that most public school teachers and civil servants live in subdivided flats. Even if the law has clear protection, those who endure pain without recourse may not decrease as a result. Moreover, being confined to a small room, one cannot sit or stand still. To the left, there are shouts and curses; to the right, there are the cries of stamping feet. If one has children, it is impossible to even find a moment of peace, let alone writing and reading. This extracurricular writing and reading is a normal way for public school teachers and civil servants to relax and be happy, and may even be an important part of their career. Thus, they are completely deprived. The cautious endure without venting, leading to depression and lethargy; the reckless cannot but seek other diversions, doing anything and everything. If one speaks of moving to a better place, it costs hundreds of thousands of gold, which one may not be able to accumulate in one's lifetime, so one can only give up. (D) In terms of transportation, although bicycles were once popular, not all public school teachers and civil servants can afford them. Public transportation has not fully met the principle of public use. Most of the passengers are public school teachers and civil servants. The cost of money and time must be unspeakable and limit the mental burden. (E) Other things, such as seasonal gifts, weddings, illnesses, and even providing for the living and burying the dead, are unavoidable in life. Even pawning and borrowing cannot avoid being stretched, which only distracts their thoughts and consumes their energy, causing their enthusiasm for serving the public to wither away, and who will mourn for them?</p>
<p>The above is not expressed in numbers, but it is enough to show that the current so-called "maintaining the minimum living standard of public school teachers and civil servants" is far from the reality. In extraordinary times, who dares to be extravagant? However, looking back, the number of people wearing strange clothes and expensive fabrics has not decreased as a result, and there are still many who spend ten thousand gold on a meal without hesitation. There are also tall buildings, even so-called mahjong rooms, which are not unique. Therefore, it is only fair to demand that public school teachers and civil servants be frugal, making it impossible for them to work or live, and yet entrust them with the most lofty mission. This is why we cannot stop calling for it.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Japan's State Ministers Reduced to a Four-Minister System <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Cabinet decided on the 17th to change the three-minister system of state ministers to a four-minister system, with Ginjiro Fujiwara taking office. The Daily News here recently summarized the significance of this matter, stating that the main significance of Fujiwara's appointment as a state minister lies in strengthening military production. Japanese military production policies have undergone a major transformation since the five key points were designated last autumn. However, this rapid shift still requires several stages. Based on the special wartime administrative powers, the government is eliminating the self-inflicted harm in production administration by establishing a cabinet advisory system to provide the government with opinions and hopes from industry leaders. Furthermore, the government is examining and correcting shortcomings in production through the administrative inspection system and determining measures to strengthen the domestic situation. The government is seeking various ways to enhance war power, such as the establishment of a military supply ministry. The "measures" that have been put in place in the past are being implemented as much as possible. The problem now lies in how to implement them. Fujiwara has always maintained close contact with the government, either advising the government in his capacity as a cabinet advisor or investigating the actual production situation in his capacity as an administrative inspector, and has provided many instructions on industrial reforms. Therefore, Fujiwara's appointment this time is actually a strengthening of the government.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Centralized Distribution of Cotton Products, Measures to be Implemented Soon, Cotton Products Management Office to be Established <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area has come to an end. The exact amount of cotton yarn and cloth in storage in other important cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Nanjing has also been clarified through investigation. Therefore, the centralized distribution of cotton products, the second step in the process, is of great concern to all parties. At the 186th meeting of the Executive Yuan, the measures for centralized distribution of cotton products were approved and officially announced for implementation. The Commercial Control Council, upon receiving the order, will establish a Cotton Products Management Office to be responsible for the storage and distribution of cotton products. Therefore, the formal distribution will be implemented soon. It is believed that the implementation of the distribution of cotton products will provide a strong guarantee for suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, and will achieve the expected results, thereby concentrating efforts to jointly increase production and share the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The categories of these distribution methods are divided into: Military and other official uses, Production raw materials, General news (divided into material exchange use, ordinary distribution use, special distribution use), Trade in special areas, and Other. Among them, the ordinary distribution for general consumption is for distribution to the general public. The quantity is determined by the Commercial Control Council after overall planning and submitted to the Executive Yuan for decision. The designated areas are the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The distribution principle is that under the Cotton Products Management Office of the Commercial Control Council, general wholesale offices are set up in each province and city. Under the general wholesale offices in each region, a number of wholesalers are designated, and then retailers are designated by each wholesaler to directly distribute to consumers, with each level controlling and being responsible for each other. The qualifications of merchants at all levels are stipulated as the local branches of the cotton products industry association, and the selection of their members is the principle. Moreover, the business conditions of each level of merchants are reported to the Commercial Control Council on a monthly basis to clarify responsibilities. Therefore, the distribution method is quite detailed and thorough, and the general public will definitely benefit from it, and it will not fail the government's intention to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia News Conference continued on the 18th. After starting at 9:30 AM, the entire body first elected Mr. Shinjiro Takaishi, President of the Mainichi Shimbun of Japan, as Chairman. The representatives of six countries, including Takeo Takahashi of Japan, Liqiu Xu of China, Semaniel of Thailand, Yazen Li of Manchukuo, Icasiano of the Philippines, and T. Wen Dan of Burma, served as Vice-Chairmen. Before the representatives of each country began their speeches, they passed a resolution to thank the frontline soldiers and read the congratulatory telegram from the President of the German News Association. Next, the representatives of each country began their speeches, starting with Takeo Ogata of the Asahi Shimbun of Japan, followed by Liqiu Xu, President of the China Daily of China, Semaniel of Thailand, Yazen Li of Manchukuo, and Icasiano of the Philippines.

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia News Conference continued its meeting from 2:00 PM on the 18th. Representatives from Burma, Hong Kong, Borneo, Malaya, Java, Celebes, Ceylon and Sumatra spoke in succession. Afterwards, the representatives spoke freely. The representative of Burma, T. Wen Dan, was the first to stand up and say: Indians have been fighting for the independence of their motherland for a long time, which we all know. However, for various reasons, they have not yet achieved their goal. Now that Mr. Chandra Bose has risen to lead the Indians in their struggle, it is a good opportunity. Therefore, he hoped to send a telegram in the name of the conference to India to express encouragement and assistance. After T. Wen Dan's explanation, the motion was passed smoothly. This was followed by a speech by Chen Chongguang, the representative of China, who said that the Greater East Asia War has now reached a considerable stage, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is also entering a formal stage. Here, I have three proposals that I hope the conference will consider and cooperate with. First, journalists should be sent to each country and region to investigate the construction situation of each country and region so that they can understand each other's situation. Second, Chinese newspapers have not yet formed a unified organization, so I would like to ask the conference to cooperate in organizing a unified agency for Chinese newspapers. Third, I hope that this conference will continue to be held in the future, and if possible, I hope that next year's conference will be held in Nanjing, the capital of China. Next, the Chinese representative Xu Liqiu spoke and proposed to unite Asian journalists and hoped to organize the Greater East Asia News Association, requesting the conference to review and approve it. As a result, it was passed. Regarding the preparatory committee and other matters, it was entrusted to the chairman to decide. The chairman then appointed Japanese representative Matsutaro Shoriki as the chairman, together with Kenichi Abe, Yoshitaka Hori, Takeo Kosaka, Chinese representatives Xu Liqiu and Mo Shenqin, Thai representative Semaniel, Manchu representative Yoshizo Matsukata, Filipino representative Icasiano, Burmese representative T.

Since its outbreak, it has been two years. During this period, the strongholds of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been destroyed, and the attitude of not accepting East Asia has been established. The construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with the times, and Asia has restored its true Asian character. This is really the result of the brave battles of the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy. We, the news circles from all over Greater East Asia, gathered in Tokyo to discuss the mission of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. We express our deepest thanks to the armed forces of the frontline soldiers who created a glorious history, and express our condolences to the heroic spirits who died in battle. For this reason, we hereby resolve as above.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Banquets All Representatives <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – All the representatives attending the Greater East Asia News Conference went to the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence at noon today to attend the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Tojo. During the banquet, Prime Minister Tojo gave a speech first, followed by Chinese representative Xu Liqiu who gave a reply on behalf of the whole body. They exchanged greetings and were very cordial, and the meeting adjourned at around 13:00.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the United States and contribute to world peace. This ancient holy war aims to crush the ambition of Britain and the United States to make East Asia their colony, and to establish a Greater East Asia based on morality and where all nations can prosper together. This great undertaking has been steadily realized. All countries and nations in Greater East Asia are like brothers, moving towards a common ideal. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which is our common lofty goal and expresses our firm determination to achieve this goal. The Greater East Asia News Conference is being held again this time to promote the determination to complete the construction of Greater East Asia and to carry out active activities to realize the Greater East Asia Declaration. This is truly worthy of celebration. The enemies Britain and the United States have been惨败 in all battles. Afterwards, they exhausted all means to desperately counterattack in both armed combat and propaganda warfare. This must not be ignored. The enemy's armed counterattack must be resolutely crushed, and if necessary, thoroughly defeated. On the other hand, we must strengthen the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, and then announce to the world our just war objectives, so that we can also win in the ideological war. This is the secret to winning the final victory and achieving the common goal of Greater East Asia. What is expected of you in the future is extremely important and great. The key is to make all the nations of Greater East Asia fully understand the basic principles of building Greater East Asia as heard in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and to move forward together towards this common ideal, and then to promote it to the whole world. I believe that you will be able to accomplish this great mission.</p>
<p>Chinese Representative's Reply</p>
<p>Your Excellency Prime Minister Tojo, in this era of East Asia striving for liberation, Your Excellency assumed the post of Prime Minister and engaged in the decisive battle against Britain and the United States. In the nearly two years of the Greater East Asia War, you drove the British and American aggressor forces out of East Asia, established a winning position, and laid the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia. Recently, the news of victory from the front has been pouring in like snowflakes. While we are sincerely pleased, we would like to express our boundless respect first. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed on January 30, and the historically epoch-making Greater East Asia Conference was convened on the 5th of this month, and the Greater East Asia Declaration has become the cornerstone of the East Asian liberation movement. This not only makes Sino-Japanese relations closer, but also enables the various nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to fulfill their natural aspirations. While we admire you, we would also like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency Prime Minister. Your Excellency Prime Minister is famous throughout East Asia and has created today's great achievements in both military and political affairs. We are not only happy for Japan, but also for East Asia. This time, we participated in the Greater East Asia News Conference and came to Tokyo to witness the various situations in Japan under the wartime system. We deeply know that the transfer of the front is by no means accidental, which makes our belief in the victory of the war even more firm. We will do our duty, unite as one, and work hard to complete the war.</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Fourth Battle Line Fighters Arise, Thoroughly Exalting Noble Ideals - Main Points of Speeches by Representatives of Various Countries - <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Speech by the Japanese Representative</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Greater East Asia New News Conference, the 18th was the second day. Japanese representative Ogata Taketora delivered a speech at the conference, the main points of which are as follows: The mission of new news and the goals of the country are the same. Now it is just for the war, and in order to complete the war to destroy the United States and Britain, it must exert its full strength. The current war is a holy war, and there is no possibility of compromise. At a time when this war is competing for victory, the Greater East Asia News Community resolutely rises, which can be said to be just in time.</p>
<p>Greater East Asia Charter The Greater East Asia Conference has been successfully held in Tokyo. A joint declaration has been issued at the conference. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be said to be an unprecedented great charter. The purpose of the Greater East Asia News Conference is to enable the one billion people of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand this joint declaration that will renew world history as the main point. The Greater East Asia News Conference can be called an unprecedented conference in history. Modern new news people must especially recognize their own strength. In recent times, the new news community in various countries has tended to commercialism, so it is undeniable that the news itself has lost its self-confidence and restraint. At a time when the news media is in a state of decline, the Japanese news media has risen up to reflect on itself, get rid of the old and corrupt: announce the news system, restore the principle of public ownership of the world, and more than 50 newspapers across the country are now engaged in the ideological war to destroy the United States and Britain. To practice the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we must take victory in the war as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Mission of the News Media</p>
<p>If we cannot win, then the Greater East Asia Charter cannot exist. Therefore, the mission of the news now is to thoroughly promote the ideals of Greater East Asia, and at the same time, we should fight based on this ideal. We must win, and the way to win is as long as the countries and nations of Greater East Asia consolidate their unity in the rear and have an unwavering belief in victory, they can succeed. The Battle of Bougainville Island completely destroyed the British and American fleets that were gradually recovering and adjusting. It is expected that more brilliant results will be achieved in the future. There is no need to worry about the outcome on the battlefield. The only thing we see in the end is unity and smashing the enemy's plans. As we move towards the future of victory, I would like to remind you with the above words to jointly deploy our ideological front.</p>
<p>Speech by the Chinese Representative</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) At the Greater East Asia News Conference, Xu Liqiu, head of the delegation of the Republic of China, delivered a speech, the main points of which are as follows: Today, at this grand gathering, the fighters of the entire East Asian Fourth Front gather in one room to discuss strategies on how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The delegation of the Republic of China is very excited to participate in this grand event. I remember that four months before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Propaganda Department of the National Government hosted the First East Asia Journalists Conference in Guangzhou. The main topic at that time was how to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At that time, the National Government had only been in power for more than a year, and what the Chinese people were striving for was Sino-Japanese peace and Sino-Japanese cooperation. The so-called Sino-Japanese peace and cooperation, from the initial launch of the peace movement, our interpretation was not only to seek peace between the two countries due to war, nor to seek diplomatic harmony between the two countries. The biggest goal we want to achieve is to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Our view is that the foundation of Sino-Japanese peace must be built on lofty and great goals. The reason why China and Japan want peace is not to seek their own interests, but to take responsibility for the overall situation in East Asia, and to build a new order in East Asia for coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Peace and Cooperation</p>
<p>Inheriting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy. What inspires us most in the repeated statements of our allied Japan is that Japan requires China's prosperity in order to jointly shoulder the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. For a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered from the aggression of Britain and the United States under the old order. China's aggression is a major crisis for East Asia and a threat to Japan. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already seen through these three points, so when he reorganized the Chinese Kuomintang, he also put forward the proposal to abolish unequal treaties. How to abolish unequal treaties? Dr. Sun Yat-sen set two guidelines: one is to awaken the people, and the other is to unite with nations in the world that treat me equally to fight together. The nation that Dr. Sun Yat-sen expected to unite with in the world that treats me equally was Japan. He explained it very clearly in "The Problem of China's Survival." When he went north with his illness, he specifically wanted to pass through Japan to deliver two important speeches. One was that Japan should assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, and the other was Pan-Asianism. The former clearly stated China's expectations for Japan, and the latter pointed out the crisis in East Asia, and only Sino-Japanese cooperation can solve the hope. In Pan-Asianism, what he proposed was the independence movement of Asian nations, using the Eastern Wangdao culture to defeat the hegemonic culture of the four directions. He spoke more earnestly to the reporters in Kobe. He said that the Meiji Restoration was the first step in the Chinese Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution was the second step in the Meiji Restoration. He also said that he hoped Japan would not forget the pain of being invaded in the past, and would help China to relieve the pain. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had studied medicine. He must have known how dangerous his illness was. He specifically wanted to pass through Japan to go to Beijing. When we think about it now, there is a very deep meaning in it.</p>
<p>For the Revival of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Work Together and Strive But the foundation of the peace movement, the goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation, was determined early on. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, our comrades struggled to inherit his legacy, but the British and American aggressors also intensified their efforts, and did everything possible to provoke discord. Fortunately, our allied Japan spared no effort to assist China in order to strengthen the Chinese government. In addition to heartfelt gratitude to Japan, the Chinese people also feel that Japan's assistance to China is tantamount to a spur to China. After receiving assistance, we must step up our efforts to complete Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with our ally Japan, and on January 9th of this year, it joined the Greater East Asia War as a member of the battle with the determination to live and die together. Recently, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the release of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and the great victory of the frontline generals of our ally Japan have all proved that the overall situation in East Asia has become clear, victory has arrived, and the time to revive East Asia and build East Asia has matured. Our enemies are Britain and the United States. With the heroic struggle of the frontline generals of our allies and the concerted efforts of the Asian nations, Britain and the United States have no other way to go but to collapse. This is what we are sure of. Now the war has reached the decisive stage, and we must launch a full-scale struggle. The victory of the war certainly requires elite troops, excellent weapons, and abundant supplies, but more importantly, it must make the entire East Asian nation have a common hatred for the British and American aggression. We must launch an ideological war against Britain and the United States, and this is the responsibility of our news colleagues. Our comrades on the Fourth Front must mobilize and unite to strive to complete the war and realize the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of Manchukuo</p>
<p>The speech by Li Yasen, the representative of Manchukuo, was entitled "The Mission of the News in the Construction of Greater East Asia." The construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with the progress of the Greater East Asia War. My Manchu Empire is a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, shouldering the important task of guarding the northern border and serving as a logistics base for Greater East Asia. Today, all 43 million people, both officials and civilians, are determined to complete the holy war. The following are some of the things that we, the people of Manchukuo, who shoulder such a glorious mission, want to do to fulfill our meager duties in the reporting mission:</p>
<p>Shouldering the Important Task of Guarding the North</p>
<p>Preventing the Intrusion of Germs "Thoroughly Understanding the Purpose of the War" Modern warfare is a total war, and the proportion of ideological warfare is becoming more and more important with the progress of military warfare. The enemy's (Britain and the United States) strategies are being used to the extreme. No matter how the enemy's strategies are, the people of Manchukuo cannot be moved by them due to their firm beliefs and experiences. However, we must always guard against Britain and the United States taking the opportunity to spread their strategies, and at the same time, we must constantly guard against the intrusion of communist ideas. "Thoroughly Understanding the Real Situation in Zhenbei" Manchukuo is located at the northern end of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and can be said to be the northern border of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. There, the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are heavily guarded, as solid as a rock. It is our important mission to thoroughly understand the situation of Zhenbei guarding by the national people of Manchukuo and to thoroughly understand the current situation by the national people of allied countries. At the same time, the people of Manchukuo have prepared themselves to deal with any situation that may arise at any time. This is a practical issue that we want to mention to everyone the recognition of a logistics base.</p>
<p>Asia is a Home Ideal</p>
<p>Cooperate to Promote Its Realization Manchukuo is the granary area of the world. The true face of Manchuria is being promoted with the progress of the war. Especially in today's situation, only Manchukuo can contribute to our ally Japan and supply food to the neighboring areas. The collection work of agricultural products currently being carried out in Manchukuo has shown the fact that "the general increase in production by 20% and the increase in production in the reclaimed area by 70%". This also shows that Manchukuo has a strong will to contribute further to the war. "Thoroughly Understanding the Inseparability of the North and South" In the construction of Greater East Asia, the North and South have an inseparable relationship. Northern construction promotes Southern construction, and Northern and Southern construction promotes Northern construction. We must also grasp its essence and further promote it. In short, under the Greater East Asia War, the mission of us in the press is becoming heavier day by day with the progress of the war. In ideological warfare, we must also establish a winning and invincible attitude like in military warfare, and at the same time rectify the winning camp. Since the founding of Manchukuo, Britain and the United States have either secretly plotted or openly obstructed. Just looking at the history of Manchukuo for more than ten years will be like looking at a fire. The so-called "Asia is a Home" by the pioneers of East Asia has now become the principle of another operation. I hope that people in the press will work hard to promote the realization of this ideal.</p>
<p>Speech by the Thai Representative</p>
<p>The main points of the speech by the Thai representative Saimani are as follows: In total war, those who engage in war are not only the frontline generals, but also the people in the rear should cooperate with the same determination. In terms of news, its responsibility lies in cooperating with the government, promoting the unity of the national people, and fully assisting the frontline soldiers in combat. And its important task is to deepen friendship and understanding between countries. In this regard, the Thai people express their deep gratitude to the Japanese new news community for their efforts to promote understanding and friendship between the two countries. The Thai press is also making active efforts to promote the friendly relations between Thailand and Japan, just like the Japanese press. It is a pleasure for the Greater East Asia news colleagues who are fighting for the same ideals and the same goals to gather in the same hall at this conference, to frankly exchange opinions on various issues of common interest in Greater East Asia, and to share the responsibility of building the Greater East Asia New Order.</p>
<p>Speech by the Burmese Representative</p>
<p>The main points of the speech by the Burmese representative Tewin Dan are as follows: The Greater East Asia news community has never had such an important gathering as this conference. This Greater East Asia News Conference is of great significance. I am reporting one thing in my capacity as a representative of the State of Burma, that is, the State of Burma is currently fulfilling its responsibilities on the western front of Greater East Asia. The State of Burma is like a rear sentry standing at the gate of Greater East Asia. All the people of Burma are taking care of the overall cooperation to complete the war. The following two points can prove that the State of Burma is a reliable country. The first is Dr. Ba Maw. Under the guidance of Dr. Ba Maw, the people are working fearlessly to the holy war. The second is the active development of the Burmese news industry. At this moment, the Burmese news community is responding to the wartime situation in the country and is committed to fulfilling its mission in order to live up to your trust.</p>
<p>Speech by the Philippine Representative</p>
<p>The main points of the speech by the Philippine representative Igaratuano are as follows: The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a very large neighborhood. The East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is composed of various countries and nations, with Japan as its leader. The Philippines, geographically, ethnically, and culturally, should be a part of the great New Asia. There are two things that can be contributed to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: one is in terms of material resources, and the other is in terms of culture. The Philippines' natural resources are truly a gift from heaven. The population is only 18 million, but the material resources are sufficient to meet the needs of four times the population. Agricultural products, timber, and fish products are very abundant, and mineral products are especially abundant. The coal and animal husbandry industries are also very developed. In the spirit of the Greater East Asia neighborhood, we will always adapt to the needs of various countries and nations within the group and fully provide the products of the funeral island. The contribution of the Philippine Islands in the cultural aspect is also worth looking forward to. The Philippine people have now decided to support the Greater East Asia countries to eliminate foreign forces that hinder the unity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and to engage in the construction of the independent Philippine Republic. The Philippine Islands news is responsible for a very large mission. We believe that with the most abundant and largest resources in the Greater East Asia economic sphere, and with honest, respectful, and trustworthy spirits and ideals, not only will the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be infinitely hopeful, but also this ideal can be popularized to the whole world, and further build a world where all people are brothers.</p>

The Soviet troops in the Fastov area have been slightly repelled by the German counterattack. The large enemy force gathered in the Kherson area has no intention of crossing the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which shows that General Buzhen has changed his offensive plan and used his reserve army to attack Krivoy Rog. At the same time, a part of the area where the Soviet troops broke through the Kerch Peninsula has been recovered by the German counterattack.

The feeling of empathy exists in everyone. The social service department of this newspaper received repeated donations of winter clothing and funds from readers yesterday, demonstrating the enthusiasm and compassion of people in society, which is infinitely gratifying.</p>
<p>We have long made the appeals of "Prepare for Winter Relief" and "The Winter Relief Opportunity is Imminent", hoping that the authorities in charge will value time and quickly advance the effort. We have also made some suggestions regarding the future winter relief organization, and we are truly looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Today's newspaper reports that the Shanghai Special City 32nd Year Winter Relief Fund Raising Committee held its first executive committee meeting yesterday, deciding on the relief plan and fundraising methods, and specific steps have also been agreed upon for obtaining relief materials. Looking at all the decisions, they are quite thorough, and we hope that they will be used as a basis to promote the work quickly, raising funds on one hand and providing relief on the other. The collecting banks and donation methods are still hoped to be announced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely represent our fellow citizens suffering and awaiting relief, appealing to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to demonstrate the highest level of compassion and empathy, donating generously and fully achieving the fundraising target. At the same time, we urge the implementation of the relief plan, so that those in need can be relieved from the suffering of freezing and hunger as soon as possible.</p>

The results are as follows: Giants beat Zhongbeishan 33-26, Whales beat Peilong 28-20, Monoc beat Fairy Team 36-27.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Defeat in South Pacific - Unavoidable by US - Talk by Section Chief Hirota <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The anti-Axis powers have suffered fatal blows in the Battle of Mono Island and the five successive naval and air battles of Bougainville Island. Although they tried to conceal the facts, by the fifth air battle of Bougainville, they could no longer hide it. The enemy news agency announced the facts. Regarding this, the information section chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Hirota, explained the reason why the enemy could no longer hide the facts and revealed the dissatisfaction within the United States with Roosevelt's direction of the war.</p>
<p>Air Battle Defeat Finally Revealed</p>
<p>Section Chief Hirota stated: "In October, the war results were reported in detail to the Japanese Headquarters. Four enemy battleships, six aircraft carriers, more than ten cruisers, and many other ships all sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. However, the enemy, whether the government authorities or the news agencies, secretly concealed the facts and did not report anything. For example, US Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters on November 9 that the Japanese reports were completely fabricated. Furthermore, US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz also denied his defeat in a broadcast on the 12th. On the same day, a spokesman for the Pacific anti-Axis Command, McWhorter, also denied it, reporting that not a single warship had been lost. However, on the 17th, the US news agency suddenly revealed the complete war report of the Fifth Bougainville Island Air Battle announced by the Japanese Headquarters. The world knows that the information released by the Japanese Headquarters is the most accurate. The enemy news agency did not make any comments on the Japanese announcement, but the fact that they could not hide it this time and reported it is noteworthy."</p>
<p>Deeply Feared Arousing Domestic Turmoil</p>
<p>"The reason why they had to conceal the Japanese war results is very easy to understand. First, if they make the unprecedented defeat public to the people, then the criticism of the Roosevelt administration, which is criticizing Japan, will be even more severe, and it will cause domestic turmoil. This is very clear. Within the United States, the criticism of Roosevelt's war policy is very bad and can be seen everywhere. To give the biggest example, in the US election results announced on November 3, in that election, important places such as the governors of New York and New Hampshire, and the mayor of Philadelphia, all won for the Republican Party. Roosevelt and the Democratic Party suffered a miserable defeat. Therefore, of the 48 state governors in the United States, the Republicans account for 25 and the Democrats 23. Roosevelt's opposition party is already in the lead." To give another example of the election defeat, in the results of the coal miner strike that was resolved in early November, the agreement reached between United Mine Workers of America President Lewis and Secretary of the Interior Ickes showed that the Roosevelt administration could not obtain labor support. If the people were to learn of the defeat at this time, it would be even more of a fatal blow to the Roosevelt administration, so they had to conceal it. This is undeniable by anyone.</p>
<p>No Favorable Comments on the Roosevelt Administration</p>
<p>"However, this time the naval and air operation is not considered an accidental encounter. They may have already been attempting to counterattack the Japanese army's positions in the South Pacific, but they suffered a major setback in the middle of implementing the plan. Therefore, when they were conducting the operation, they concealed the defeat, but now they cannot hide it, so they ordered the news agency to announce their defeat. As for why they are taking aggressive action, it can be inferred that the Roosevelt administration suffered a miserable defeat in both the election and the strike, and the people have no favorable comments on its war policy. If he runs for president for the fourth term next year, then the Democratic Party's failure is a foregone conclusion. Therefore, at this time, there is a need to make a big victory in one fell swoop to save Roosevelt himself and the Democratic Party's reputation. They do not want Japan to have enough time to stabilize, because they are deeply afraid of Japan becoming stronger and stronger, so they plan to carry out a preemptive operation to capture Rabaul. Regarding this, it can be seen in the broadcast by Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz on the 12th, where he said: 'We have reached the time to implement against Japan, and from now on we will give the Japanese army no time to rest.' Furthermore, British Prime Minister Churchill also said in a speech at the Lord Mayor of London's residence on November 9: 'The war in 1944 will reach its climax, and that year will be an incredible time. That year is the year of the American election.' From the above facts, it can be clearly understood that Roosevelt had no choice but to take aggressive action in military and political affairs in order to save the hearts of the people, but every attack was defeated miserably.</p>
<p>A Great Victory in Axis Operations</p>
<p>This is not only a victory for Japan, but also for the entire Axis powers on the way to war. In the future, the results of this kind of miserable defeat for the enemy will become even clearer. This was first manifested in the announcement of the British Indian Army. On November 5, British Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck told the Indian Privy Council: 'The operation to recapture Burma from India must be postponed temporarily. Before new troops and new weapons arrive, it is impossible to carry out an attack on Burma. At present, it is not possible to guarantee success against Japan.' Furthermore, Admiral Mountbatten, commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, said on the 17th that there is no hope of realizing a major offensive against Japan in the near future due to various reasons. Among the various reasons he referred to, the flight base is also one of them. Furthermore, attacking Burma from India requires a large number of transport ships and escort fleets, but those fleets have been lost in the recent Bougainville naval and air battle, as anyone can guarantee. Furthermore, although the British fleet did not participate in this naval battle, they wanted to replenish the part of the British fleet that had been cut off, so the Burmese offensive had to be postponed. This explanation seems to be reasonable, and they also need ships in the Mediterranean, so it can be seen that this defeat in the South Pacific has caused the overall situation of the anti-Axis war to lose its timing. They will rush to build ships in the future in an attempt to fight Japan, but only for the Japanese navy to destroy them. No matter when, they will not be able to complete a large fleet with the strength to attack Japan. The British and American people, who have already understood the results of the Fifth Bougainville Island Air Battle, will explore the results of the first, second, third, and fourth air battles. At that time, the expression of the results of today's naval and air battles will be even more profound."</p>

<h3 id="e41">How to Improve Bank Performance? <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Having recently read the article "The Business of Japan's Five Major Banks in the First Half of This Year" in the 45th issue of "Enterprise Weekly" (originally published in the September 11th issue of the Toyo Keizai Shimpo), I cannot help but feel that the upward trend of the banking industry during wartime is not accidental. The combined net profit of Japan's five major banks—Teikoku, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, Sumitomo, and Sanwa—in the first half of this year reached as much as 45,760,000 yen, an increase of 3,678,000 yen compared to the previous period. The reason for this sudden leap forward can be attributed to two factors: First, due to the mergers of various major banks (Mitsui Bank and Dai-ichi Bank merged to establish Teikoku Bank, Mitsui absorbed Daihyaku Bank, and Yasuda absorbed Nippon Chogin Bank), the banking business has progressed due to rationalized operations, and the amount of capital flowing in and out has expanded dramatically. Second, and this is the fundamental reason, the large increase in loans to important industries for the current situation has contributed significantly. "According to the consolidated financial statements of each bank, the increase in deposits and loans, especially the rapid increase in loans, is rare in recent times." Furthermore, because loans to industries related to the current situation will continue, it is expected that the performance of major Japanese banks will generally continue to be smooth in the future.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that to improve bank performance in the future, it is necessary to follow these two key points: First, rationalize operations, the key to which lies in the mergers of banking businesses; second, regulate the financial market, the key to which lies in the increase in industrial loans. We have previously discussed the mergers of company and bank businesses, and we feel that rather than focusing on insufficient capital and urging poorly managed banks to increase capital, it would be better to focus on merging their businesses. As for regulating the financial market, it has recently been learned that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Bank of Money Shops, under the restrictions of the new lending methods released by the General Association of Banks and Money Shops, will provide loans for legitimate uses in various industries, such as developing production enterprises and purchasing product raw materials, after a review has been passed. This is naturally welcome news for those who are concerned about connecting financial capital with industrial capital.</p>

<p>The third interest payment on the Republic of China Year 31 Stabilization Financial Public Bonds, the first principal repayment on the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Bonds, and the interest payable will be paid by designated banks starting from the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>According to financial sources, the total amount of Stabilization Financial Public Bonds issued is 150 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 5% and a term of 20 years. Only interest is paid within ten years from the date of issuance, and starting from the eleventh year, principal is repaid every six months, with each repayment being one-fortieth of the total amount, until the end of May of the Republic of China Year 61, when the entire amount will be repaid. This third interest payment totals 37.5 million yuan, which has been deposited by the Ministry of Finance in the special accounting item of the Central Reserve Bank according to the redemption and interest payment schedule, and credited to the fund account of the public bonds for repayment. The Central Reserve Bank will handle the payment starting from the end of the month. The total amount of Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds issued is 10 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and interest is paid twice a year. Only interest is paid in the first year, and starting from the second year, principal is repaid once every six months, with each repayment being one-twentieth of the total amount, until May 31 of the Republic of China Year 42, when the entire amount will be repaid. This first principal repayment and the due interest payable amount to 500,000 yuan for principal repayment and 300,000 yuan for interest payment, which has been allocated by the Finance Bureau to the Central Reserve Bank and the Fuyu Bank and credited to the public bond fund management committee account for allocation. The Central Reserve Bank and the Fuyu Bank will handle the payment starting from the end of the month, which shows the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market generally remained in a narrow trading range. Initially, following the upward trend of the previous day, the northern stocks rose sharply, and trading was quite active. The performance of various stocks is described below:</p>

<h3 id="e46">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's market rose sharply, but the types were uneven, because the number of those rising was not weak, but Type E was flat without rising or falling, and Type B even saw a decline. This uneven situation was also due to the temporary relationship of scrambling for demand, and the fact that Type B was lower than Type D has not yet found its solution. Yesterday, Type C opened and rose immediately, roughly matching the closing price of the after-hours market the day before. After that, it gradually became fatigued. The final closing price at noon was far higher than the previous day, which was said to be due to positive news and short covering. Type A rose, Type B fell instead, Type D rose even higher than Type B, and Type E remained at the previous price, without any honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Call Loans: Yesterday morning, the call loan rate of the Money Shops Association was 1.7%, unchanged. The tightness of bank loans only eased for one day and then tightened again.</p>

For various major commodities, movement within this city is permitted, except for cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which are temporarily not allowed to be moved. As for the statement that after approval by the association, a "Movement Certificate" will be issued, and with this certificate, an application will be made to the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Association, this association has no such regulation.

<h3 id="e49">Food Production Increase and National Government Countermeasures <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Shiheng, Minister of Food of the National Government, recently gave a speech stating that the rice collection and distribution business will be transferred to the Commercial Control Association, and that the task of the Ministry of Food in the future will be to promote the production increase movement and make every effort to solve the wartime food problem. This resolute statement is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Minister Gu adopts the following methods for the Ministry of Food's production increase policy, namely, expanding the production area, popularizing superior varieties, emphasizing overall production increase, economizing on farm management, eliminating pests and diseases, and improving cultivation methods, etc., which have already included the entire plan. How to specifically develop the key points of this policy is very important and a necessary condition for the production increase movement, which must be emphasized. Under the rule of the National Government, in the past few years, the general trend has been towards increasing production. Studying the reasons for the production increase, the main reason is the high price of food, which farmers are happy to cultivate. However, there is no guarantee that this reason for production increase can continue to be maintained in the future. If this reason disappears, what methods should be used to stimulate farmers to increase production is a major issue currently facing the production increase movement.</p>
<p>Due to the controlled purchase of food, the highest price of rice and wheat has been set. If compared with the daily prices of daily necessities, rice and wheat are still low. For this reason, that is, the high price of daily necessities, farmers will tend towards a self-sufficient economy and reduce their intention to increase production. In other words, the agricultural products sold by farmers are at a fixed price, while the goods that farmers need to buy are at black market prices. It is clear that agriculture, which produces goods, is forming a self-sufficient state. To remedy the tendency of farmers to be self-sufficient and stimulate them to move towards increasing production, daily necessities and fertilizers, etc., must also be reliably distributed to farmers at a fixed price, so that they are not lacking. Although this is a problem outside the management of the Ministry of Food, since we are discussing production increase, it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the strong promotion of the production increase movement requires a large amount of funding. This funding should be borne by the national treasury, because the production increase movement is the supreme command of the wartime economy. If the national treasury feels it is difficult, it can also be paid by the Rice Control Association. It seems natural for the Rice Control Association to collect fees. I hope that the authorities will vigorously promote this production increase movement, and the Chinese and Japanese people also hope to actively assist in order to embark on the path of advancement!

<p>(Continued from page 3 on the 16th)</p>
<p>Helpless Children</p>
<p>The New Bridge Street Women and Children Education Relief Association houses 197 destitute and helpless children, divided into a kindergarten and a boys' home. Boys under the age of nine and girls under the age of thirteen are placed in the kindergarten, which currently has 49 children (40 girls), who are receiving kindergarten education. In this courtyard with a glass roof, rows of old, clumsy, and blackened long tables and benches are arranged, and dozens of ragged, sallow-faced children are "studying by themselves." A frail little girl of six or seven, barely able to stand, is moving along the edge of the table, the sound of her pitiful little bones almost piercing through her pale skin. Several, however, are waving their heads, which are blooming with "white flowers," running and chasing each other. Mr. Zhang Huiyuan, who is in charge of teaching, said that most of these children are street urchins and little beggars. Many were already seriously ill when they entered the association, so the mortality rate is alarming. The association is doing its best to meet the children's basic needs, but it cannot afford the necessary clothing or school supplies, nor can it afford resident doctors or nurses. Of course, the children may not even dream of toys or entertainment.</p>
<p>In the hall and the courtyard with the large open doors, there is a noisy group of boys. Some are chasing and jumping, some are arguing, and some are buried in books or slumped over their desks, seemingly dozing off. On the left side of the hall, five or six rows of long tables and benches are neatly arranged, with dozens of students sitting and reading attentively. The teacher, bracing himself, is vigorously reciting the Chinese sentences in the textbook, and the students are chanting along, sentence by sentence, reminding one of the scene of studying hard in a private school as a child. However, the teacher is not perched high on the podium like the old-fashioned teachers of private schools, but is busily running between the desks, enthusiastically asking students if they understand the lessons. After class, the class leader comes out to wipe the blackboard, and the teacher has to gather other classes of students to teach them. His voice is already a little hoarse, which shows how hard he is working.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Huiyuan said that this is the boys' home, which houses 148 homeless and destitute children over the age of nine. Every day, they receive education according to the organization and curriculum of an ordinary elementary school, divided into six classes, from the first grade of elementary school to the sixth grade of senior elementary school. The textbooks used are exactly the same as those used in ordinary elementary schools. However, due to the lack of teachers and staff, they cannot have the complete management and education system of a general school. This is a big problem. The work-study system has also not been implemented due to a lack of funds and talent, which is even more regrettable.</p>
<p>Yes, in addition to ordinary academic subjects, the boys' home of the association pays special attention to music. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, they have music lessons. They have even organized a music team. It is said that there are currently about 30 trained and skilled members of the team, led by Zhu Guansheng. They often accept invitations from various weddings and ceremonies. Because the children are highly skilled, their performances are popular, and their musical instruments are complete, they receive several thousand yuan a month, which is used to subsidize the association.</p>
<p>In addition to the kindergarten and the boys' home, there are also 45 refugees sent by various charitable organizations who are homeless and destitute. Including the 31 workers, the total number of people here is 268. They only eat twice a day, usually a bowl of porridge and a bowl of rice. However, due to financial difficulties, the so-called rice is already mixed with various coarse grains, and the so-called porridge is not necessarily nutritious enough. Recently, they often eat "porridge with rice bran," which is actually a thick paste mixed with rice bran. Malnutrition and insufficient clothing naturally lead to disease. Fortunately, the Red Cross Hospital provides free medical care, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Mr. Zhang Yonghan often comes to provide consultations. But what is the use of passive measures to "treat the symptoms" without active measures to "treat the root cause?"</p>
<p>Looking back at the large collection photo of children available for adoption on the gate of the association, one is forever reminded of a flock of bitter little lambs and hardworking and suffering "shepherds."</p>
<p>Women Saved</p>
<p>Leaving the China Relief Association for Women and Children, take the No. 3 tram heading northwest, get off at Zedapu Road and Chengdu Road, turn into Beicheng Road, a fairly wide cobblestone street, and walk less than 200 steps. On the left is a light-colored building, which is the women's home of the association. Although it shares a building with the old people's home and some schools, it gives people a good impression of cleanliness and orderliness as soon as you enter, showing the diligence of the staff. In the courtyard, a refugee woman is working hard to sweep the floor.</p>
<p>Director Chen Shijinlin, a friendly and capable woman, is busy working, taking care of this and taking care of that. She said that they currently house 173 destitute women over the age of 14, from various backgrounds. Most of them are street children, rescued from trafficking, runaway concubines, adopted daughters, child brides, and prostitutes who are unwilling to engage in the flesh trade. In addition, there are lost women, many of whom are sent by the Ministry of Labor, various charitable organizations, and philanthropists.</p>
<p>These unfortunate women come from different regions and classes, and have different personalities and qualities. In addition to some who were sent to the women's home from the Relief Association's kindergarten at the age of 13, most have not received proper education, and many are illiterate. Moreover, their past lives were of all shapes and sizes and had no rules. Therefore, when they enter the Relief Association, they are destitute, without food or clothing, without support, and without any comfort of human mutual assistance and love. Therefore, when they enter the Relief Association, they cannot help but feel grateful for the association's dedicated assistance and feel human love for the first time. For the other women who have also been rescued, they may not have known each other before, but they are all "people who have fallen to the ends of the earth" and have a special friendship of mutual sympathy. Thus, the lives of the women in the Relief Association constitute a life of love and mutual assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Kong Sheng Academy Essay Contest First Place: How to Practice the Eight Virtues (Part 2) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yao</p>
<p>Therefore, in initiating and embarking on this journey, there are things that must be clarified beforehand. If the understanding of goodness is unclear and the study of governance is not thorough, then even if one rises at the rooster's crow and strives diligently, one will still inevitably fail to hit the mark and neglect self-examination. This is not only useless but also harmful. What is virtue? It is the original mind. The reason why sages are sages is simply because they have fully realized their original mind. Becoming a sage or a madman lies in a single thought; building a nation or destroying it lies in a single word. Therefore, a gentleman should be cautious about the subtle beginnings and firmly rooted in his heart. If one only seeks to recover after the actions have already manifested, isn't it difficult? If one can be sincere and not deceive one's own conscience in solitude, seek a rapid return to the good without repeating one's mistakes, and fully realize this original mind in being filial to one's father, then it is called filial piety; fully realize this original mind in respecting one's elder brother, then it is called fraternal duty; fully realize this original mind in serving the country, then it is called loyalty; fully realize this original mind in dealing with friends, then it is called trustworthiness; fully realize this original mind in being respectful and yielding, then it is called propriety; fully realize this original mind in having a sense of shame and being resolute, then it is called righteousness; fully realize this original mind in being self-possessed and principled, then it is called integrity; fully realize this original mind in being compassionate and unwilling to do harm, then it is called a sense of shame. All of these are simply about fully realizing one's original mind, without relying on external things, not doing things with a purpose, not seeking personal gain, and not pretending.</p>
<p>However, nature is the way that combines the internal and external. Therefore, although filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trustworthiness are said to involve treating others, they are also for oneself. Loving the people and developing things are precisely the means to manifest virtue and cultivate oneself. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are primarily for rectifying oneself, but when one is rectified, things will naturally be rectified. Governing the state and pacifying the world are ultimately rooted in rectifying the heart and making one's intentions sincere. Furthermore, the heart is not about being selfish. Merely referring to the heart within one's chest is the empty, detached heart of the Buddhists, not the integrated heart of us Confucians that is one with all things. Only by regarding heaven and earth and all things as one can there be no distinction between oneself and others, no division between internal and external. Providing food and drink and the toil of service are not sufficient to express filial piety and fraternal duty. One must wholeheartedly put them into practice, preserving them completely in life and returning them completely at death, feeling no shame in one's actions, only then can one be considered truly filial and fraternal. Only with a heart that feels the drowning of others as one's own drowning and the hunger of others as one's own hunger can one be called loyal. Dying in a ditch is not enough to be considered true loyalty. Only with the ambition to undertake great responsibilities and adhere to past principles while anticipating future needs can one be considered trustworthy. Clinging to a pillar while waiting for the water is a stubborn, inflexible trustworthiness that is not suitable for practice. One should base propriety on virtues and rely on benevolence, not seek profit through propriety; one should regard upholding righteousness to the death as righteousness, not regard isolated acts of heroism as righteousness; one should regard being uneasy about enjoying delicious food as integrity, not regard noisy boasting as integrity; one should regard not being able to put virtue into practice as shame, not regard wearing shabby clothes as shame. If one can truly expand this heart, tirelessly and unceasingly, renewing it daily, then the Six Classics will all be commentaries on oneself. Fully developing one's mind to understand one's nature and thereby know heaven is what is meant by the eight virtues, which can be applied appropriately in any situation. What difficulty would there be in becoming a sage! How can one be compared to those who stubbornly learn individual actions and details! Otherwise, if the foundation is not established and the original mind is obscured, merely searching outside oneself for external actions and imitating the words and deeds of the ancients, being fragmented and unable to integrate, even if one's conduct seems loyal and trustworthy and one's actions seem honest and upright, it is merely imitating outward appearances and seeking to gain reputation, thus becoming a thief of virtue, no more than a village worthy. I foresee that their efforts will become increasingly clumsy, like a tree without roots and a river without a source. Although even ditches and streams may be full, they will eventually wither away day by day!</p>
<p>Alas, the way has been obscured for a long time! The common people are misled by heretical doctrines and do not reflect on themselves, content with the commonplace and lacking far-reaching vision. Some laugh at the great way as impractical and refuse to practice it, while others regard the sages as too lofty and dare not emulate them. Therefore, they either become unscrupulous villains without restraint or are content with self-improvement within their own community and cannot progress further. Even those with talent, wisdom, and the ability to act are often immersed in the teachings of the Buddhists, receiving baptism at the altar of Christ, while abandoning the practical way of our own sages, which has been used daily for thousands of years. This is truly lamentable. The duty of scholars is to implement the principle of great harmony when in office, striving to benefit the whole world, and to elucidate the way of benevolence and righteousness when out of office, enlightening the people. Now, they sit idly by, watching the sacred learning decline without rescuing it, failing to correct the people who are misled by heretical doctrines, and failing to alleviate the suffering and confusion of the people. Instead, they live in comfort and seclusion, indulging in the study of commentaries. This is truly a great shame for us scholars! Alas! Yi Yin was merely a farmer from the wilderness, yet he took it upon himself to ensure that no single person was left unprovided for. Jesus was merely a Jewish carpenter, yet he dedicated himself to saving the world. In a village of ten households, there must be someone who is loyal and trustworthy. Sages are of the same kind as us, and those who strive can also become like them. Is it possible that in this current age, there are no such people? Who can stand out independently, rising up without waiting for external forces, not being tempted by personal gain, not being misled by common customs, firmly believing and diligently practicing without empty words, and resolutely carrying forward the essential tradition of four thousand years, thereby upholding the way of Confucius, Mencius, Cheng Yi, Zhang Zai, Lu Jiuyuan, and Wang Yangming!
