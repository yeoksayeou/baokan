<h3 id="c1">正己 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近之接收上海租界及江蘇省政府改組，皆為革新政治之絕好機會。本報曾檢討旣往，論列來茲，希冀政府當局重視此機會，把握此機會，而納政治於正軌，以完遂我中華民族之時代使命。中國政治之窳敗，因而造成社會之黑暗與夫民族之墮落，是皆不可諱言之事實，亦且由來已久而於今益烈。故欲列舉興革之點，確有罄竹難盡之感，縱使提綱　領就其犖犖大者加以申論，亦仍難言盡其意。八月十六日本報社論之結句中有「民意上達，人材優秀，吏治整肅，三者備而上海治。」之語，以為建設新上海之綱要，亦為建設新中國之重大前提。然自接收上海租界以來已逾兩月，雖為時尙短，未能責望過者，但在市民立塲所得之影　，雖不致「大失所望」，然對於實踐上述最簡明之三點仍無任何迹象可尋。於是可見欲挽旣倒之狂瀾，決非一蹴所能就，勢不容不追本窮源，先培養精神上之力量，以圖匡　。爰冉以純潔之忠誠，更進芻言。</p>
<p>凡在世界上有地位之民族，必各有其可寳貴之傳統精神，恃為無形之武器，以捍衛其民族之生命。倘受任何影響於不知不覺之中，喪失其固有之傳統精神，則民族必由腐化而受人侮蔑，寖假以致衰落而趨減亡，所謂事有必至理有固然者。我中華民族具有四千餘年之文化，亦自有其可歌可泣之史蹟，其盛也必常其傳統精神發揚光大之時，其衰也必際其傳統精神毀滅淪喪之頃，往事陳迹，班斑可考。惟其歷史悠久賢哲輩出，故對於任何方面皆建立具體之楷模足資矜式者，而政治之基本傳統精神，厥為「正己」。</p>
<p>躬自厚而薄責於人，乃正己之始。修身齊家治國平天下，乃正已之終。政者正也，子率以正孰敢不正，其身正不令而行，其身不正雖令不從，此所以說明正已臨　之效。君君臣臣父父子子，此所以說明正己相互之用。伊古以來，闡述正已之言辭，足以發明其精髓者，典册俱載，不遑枚舉，惟知而不行，於事無補。</p>
<p>正己者訓練一己正常之思想及正確之觀念，不為聲色貨利刀鋸鼎鑊之誘脅而有　倚。因而能堅立高尙之志善養浩然之氣，放之則彌六合，卷之可藏於方寸之中，故能窮則獨善其身，達則兼善天下。由此而勵行儉約樸質之生活，努力經世澤物之工作，敦品格，振名節，一切所謂毀譽得失生死禍福不足有動於中，然後能於取舍出處之間，斷然有所不苟。表裏相符，言行一致，方可與言政治，蓋政治者原正己而　庶民之謂，政為因治為果，不先求『政』无以言『治』。</p>
<p>正己之修養，初非艱深崇高不可幾及，如一般之所想像者。惟中人以下缺乏不移之毅力及堅定之意向，而易為環境所同化。當政治淸明社會敦樸之世，則雖販夫走卒亦知檢點言行，惟恐為同儕所不齒，至於士大夫之流更不敢放浪形骸，以自取身敗名裂。故昔之遊宦終身，生無資斧還鄕死無棺木殯殮者，時有所聞。不特不以此寒乞為恥，抑且以兩袖淸風為榮。刑於寡妻施於兄弟，閭里傳播子孫景慕，潛移默化相習成風。深知官為公僕，以服務為中心之思想，更知為民父母，應以愛民為服官之觀念。由正己而儉約，由儉約而廉潔，於是無往而不剛勇果毅，造成於穆肅雍之境地。迨夫世衰道微，見利忘義，國家名器視同商品，官吏本身莫不以講本求利為前提，結黨營私為宦海之原則，　奢淫佚成為官階之準繩。下車數月可積巨萬，非如是不足以趨奉上峯睥睨同僚，上行下效羣相　羨。故一入宦途如墮深淵，欲自振拔而不能者有之，以他人之行徑而自恕者有之，妄自菲薄不以移風易俗為己任者有之，　或意存五日京兆不願自勵自苦而坐　昇官與發財之連鎖機會者亦有之，此無他正已之修養未深自制之能力薄弱，不足與言邦無道之愚。弱點暴露，邪亂相乘，於是上下其手，官民盡趨於墮落，一切的一切，　不迂避光明之途徑，以期完遂私人曖昧之企圖。如此而求民意上達，人才優秀，吏治整肅，是猶緣木求魚，　乎其難。且慾海難　，私　無極，循至賄賂公行，靦不為怪。或半推半就，以不露形迹而自詡；或避重就輕，以明哲保身而求恕。心非口是，欲蓋彌彰。甚且　官賣爵，妻妄得從中漁利；專橫淫暴，　黨得狐假虎威。從非本人指使，亦當坐以失察之罪。實則已不正，則家不齊，物腐虫生，由來有漸，遑論其大者　者</p>
<p>今日之社會積　巳深，不願棄暗投明而敝　其非法之權勢者，固大有人在：必將採取任何卑劣之手段，傾其全力以抗政治修明之趨向，務使從政者喪氣灰心知難而退。故凡在朝在野之志士，應及早相互集合，砥礪澈底正己之修養，培植雄厚無畏之魄力，誓與　魅　　不共戴天，撲滅一切足以危害民族生存之敗類，戰勝一切阻撓政治革興之障碍，恢復我中華民族政治上之傳統精神，然後種種問題庶可迎刃而解。否則談不到修明政治，更談不到民族使命。</p>

<h3 id="c3">日菲昨晚交歡廣播 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日菲慶祝菲律賓獨立交歡廣播，於十五日下午七時卅分在菲律賓國歌演奏聲中開始，首由日本東條首相致祝　，繼由菲律賓新大總統洛勒爾致答謝辭，復奏日本國歌，播　迄八時完畢，茲誌東條首相及洛勒爾大總統之廣播內容如次：</p>
<p>東條首相致辭·菲律賓國於今年十月十四日宜宣布獨立，成為大東亞共榮圈之一完全獨立國家，步　光輝之前程，深　慶幸。洛勒爾閣下為全國民一衆輿論所　，已就任首屆菲律賓國大總統，菲律賓一千八百萬民衆達此光榮之日，將如何歡欣荏　，自不可而喻，於茲謹表衷心慶祝。囘顧四十餘年前菲律賓由志士李薩爾氏等之戮力，即將獲得獨立，當時美國已約定使菲律賓成立義勇軍，結果使菲律賓民衆化為美國之順民，於茲四十餘年來，菲律賓民衆隱忍自重，繼續奮鬥結果，首由美國釣以自治，繼約以獨立，美國所謂之獨立，實為擁護其本身之經濟利益，持此之欺騷菲律賓民衆而巳。余確當菲律賓國氏賭君，必熟　此意，無庸再事贅言，又美國恃其物質之明，欺騙麻醉菲律賓民衆，更利用菲律賓為壓迫榨取東亞之基地，以遂其貪得無厭之制霸世界野心，其間日本為於和平中確立東亞之和平起見、多年隱忍持種以迄最近，但為芟除擾亂東亞之禍根計，終於前年十二月八日被迫訴諸武力，賴天皇積威、及將士之忠勇善戰，卒將　居菲律賓之美國勢力掃蕩凈盡，　時未及二年，菲律賓已完成各項準備，基於東亞人之立場，於理想下獲得多年翹望之真獨立，為菲律賓計，又為大東亞計。誠不勝其同慶也。誠然菲律賓之獨立，必須大東亞戰爭之完成，始可逹其獨立目的，日本更為菲律賓國之發展興隆計，將予以完全協力，故望菲律賓國國民諸君，在洛勒爾大總統閣下之指導下，日後益加奮發圖强，恢復大東亞民族之真精神。並致力於本國之防衛及確立戰時態勢。成為大東亞共榮圈一環之獨立國，為建設大東亞而與日水及大東亞諸國密切協力。現大東亞諸國家為達到解放大東亞，建設道　世界之共同目的，與日本協力邁進，今菲律賓共和國又巳誕生，於大東亞諸國家中，增添一新國家，洵堪祝賀也。日本深期與此等諸國家相互提携合作，局心努力，以達成萬邦共榮之大理想。</p>
<p>菲總統洛勒爾廣播詞：菲律賓共和國巳於昨日宣告獨立，舉行菲律賓共和國成立典禮，蓋菲律賓之獨立，乃為我菲律賓民衆多年之宿願與最高抱負，終已達到，此實受日本帝國所賜者也。余於此謹代表全非民衆對東條總理大臣閣下及日本國國民深表謝意。菲烏獨立前之一切預備與措置，得以順利進行者，實有頻於日本陸海軍之協力與全面之援助、吾人於此亦唯有深表謝意而巳。於此更堅決表白對目下推進中之解放大東亞民族之神堅大業，誓與協力。菲律賓共和國之前途，實有許多困難，　吾人為希望菲律賓成為大東亞共榮圈有力之一環，且在世界自由國家社會中，能得其所，決勇往邁進。</p>

<p>後日召開國民議會</p>

<p>軍校已有很長的歷史，軍校學生已由一個階段到另一個階段，梓椒的為國家民族盡力。國家民族的生命，是無限的，個人的生命是有限的，所謂歷史，就是繼續不斷進步的記載。進步要靠在歷史過程中各階段的人，把自己數十年的心血放進去，好像一顆顆的石子，一粒粒的泥沙鋪在一條大道一樣，生在各歷史階段的人底心與血，接連起來，就成為一卷歷史。軍校以前各期學生，已經盡了各期的任務，好像沙石已經鋪了一段一段的馬路一樣，現在這一段比起從前更為偉大，而且巳有光明照在前面，引導着我們踏上去，這種光明是什麽呢，就是百年以來英美侵略勢力的清算，望以前　的軍校學，陸續歸來，大家一齊踏上這條中國唯一光明的大路。</p>

<p>懇談會的意義</p>
<p>第三天東亞經濟北京懇談會，自九月二十七日起，在北京中南海懷仁堂舉行，會期三日。此次懇談會，為中國參戰後第一次懇談會，會塲空氣充滿懇摯的精神·可確切感知各經濟人。祈望大東亞戰爭勝利之熱誠，而且此次懇談會比前次更多建設性之　見，在該會誠為可喜之現象。唯因懇談會之本來使命、係在互相認識各方面經濟情形·以資增强戰力、換言之、乃消極性者，故縱有何種建設性意見、亦不過如是而巳、因而未免有美中不足之感、然此係從懇談會原有性質而來　然結果，與其他會中所提出討論之問題立可付諸積極實行之會議，本質上迥然不同，是以懇談會所提議之問題，未能付諸實行，實屬不得巳之事。</p>
<p>在則，在第一次北京懇談會上，中國人士之發言者、佔絕對多數、日本人士則傾聽中國經濟人所欲求者，所欲言者，而反映於施策上。具有此種經騐之人，在此次懇談會上見中國人士發言較少，頗有不少作此次懇談會情况作熱烈之批評者，然在中日一體積極增强戰力之今日，日本經濟人與其襲用所謂傾聽中國經濟人之聲以求其效果之方法　毋寧詳談當地中日經濟界人士如何活躍，與夫具有何種經濟上之共同困惱，較有意義。</p>
<p>視東亞經濟懇談會為交　聯誼之會，說該會是否有名無實之存在者，雖不能說務，但日本內地經濟人與當地經濟人，茍能開誠布公，互述希望，要求，及困難，而使他們加入開發經濟，增强戰力，則吾人殊無理由左袒懇談會無用論。</p>
<p>資材與勞工問題</p>
<p>在第一天的鑛工業部份會議上，特別成為問題者，乃在如何打鬧增產之狹路，鐵·煤·礬土等重要資源之開發，係日本增强戰力所不可或缺者。華北蒙疆當局，目下雖努力增產，唯資材不足及勞工問題，顯然成為此種物資增產之困難。例如煤鐵之增加生產及輸送量，因未能取得更多資材，而阻礙大量增產。關於此種情形，屢經各地代表提出，且渴望轉用日本內地及朝鮮之閑　設備欲當地者，為數亦相當多。</p>
<p>至於勞工問題，其根本　結　在食糧問題。且華北勞工現尙未　完全的勞工管理之墳。這雖是解決勞工問題之　，唯當地之勞工管理·實非易事。但任其自然、則勞工問題永遠不能解決，是以鑛工業會上屢有冀望勞　管理之聲。</p>
<p>就地發展輕工業</p>
<p>至若輕工業，日本內地之企業整備雖予當地輕工業以良好影響，但若以為將此種閑置設備逐漸移至當地，則當地之輕工業即可發達，亦難成的當，蓋實際情形決不如此簡單。蓋日本內地縱　實行整頓企業，亦無立即將多數閑置設備遷往　北或蒙疆之理由，且自政府當局言，如不通籌大東亞共榮圈全體，即不能樹立計畫，是以一切似難盡如當地財界人士所希望而簡單解決。</p>
<p>唯當收買食糧而須大量交換物資時，若能就地製造之，則在當地之輕工業，實為成績優越之表現，殊為明瞭。此點不僅在懇談會中提及、即　東京，似巳充分認識。然這不單是人士尙須就地援助輕工業之發達。</p>
<p>化學工業審議機關</p>
<p>至於化學工業，以用鹽作原料之蘇打及酸類工業為中心，可舉出玻璃·油類·製藥·橡膠·造紙等工業，　　之化學工業，雖以控有長蘆鹽田之天津地區及以山東鹽田為中心之靑島地區為其中樞、然此等工業在華北，其發展實比其他工業為遲，此蓋由於電力·資材·資金等之不足　也·當此向完遂大東亞戰爭邁進之秋，促使化學工業發達，整備蘇打及酸類之當地目給　制，實屬必要，所以該會亦加以强調。靑島代表主張應設置將當地技術團體打成一片之化學工業審議機關，以資發展此種工業，頗惹注目。</p>
<p>又，關於電力之開　問題，華北電業會社內藤副總裁曾提起黃河發電計畫，　引起注意。內藤氏力稱祇須有努力之熱誠，資材不足亦可克服，對主張資材不足即不能增產，而動輒提及資材之經濟人，發出一大　　，此事在鑛工業會中，似屬最堪注意者。</p>
<p>解決食糧問題</p>
<p>第一日鑛工業會之後，第二日上午舉行農業會，下午則續開物資交流會</p>
<p>在農業會中，最威問題者，即在減輕為農業增產根本條件之農民負擔。口頭商　　　，而實際不減輕農民之負擔，則增產之無望，固不待敵資。當前，華北農民之負擔實已過重。此雖因華北政務委員會之行政尚未充分滲透各地農村所致，唯其最大原因，華北農民之現狀，實在於課稅繁重，除中央所課稅金外，另須繳納多種稅金。此點首須糾正。其次應加考慮者，則在以生產費　基準而決定　產物之收買價格，以圖與一般物資調整，出席代表中有持此主張者甚眾。要之，謂農業會之議論中心。自始至終一貫為減輕農民負擔，決非過　。此為提案，在列席之當地暨大東亞　當局者間，必有強烈反應，對於今後　行之施　上，給予甚多暗示　。</p>
<p>正如小　會長於懇談會終了後所述，在華北，緊張所發生之食糧問題，並非單是華北，　　之食糧問題，實係中。日，滿一體之食糧問題，因而此問題之　決，不准當地各自努力　，而須中日滿共同協力始能解決之問題。</p>
<p>煤，鐵，　，　土，棉花等等，不僅為華北之重要資源，亦為大東亞廣域圈之重要資源　　　日南方資源尚未達到充分利用之　　　華北，蒙　之資源如何重要，不言而喻，增加此類資源　量之際，所不得不解決之問題即係食糧問題，著視減　農民負擔乃農業會　提出之解決食糧問題之關鍵，則執政當局其將充分考慮墾談會中各經濟人之呼聲，而反映於施策上乎。</p>
<p>設置常務委會</p>
<p>在下午物資交流會上，頗多建設性之意見，為如希望為加強陸路運輸力，及除去交易上之障碍，而設置專門委員會，加強對日　應，與振興貿易等等　。據天津代表指摘，阻　今日中國國內貿易者，共一在於海陸運輸未能盡依計　實行，其二　為兩區域間（即華北與華中）之物價對策，目標各異。</p>
<p>關於海　運輸之依　計畫實施，華北交通乃其中心，雖本軍專當局，及大使館等之指示，以期毫無遺憾，但由從專　易之經濟人而觀，猶具不完備之點，此即問題所在。故為天津代表所言。設置常務　員會，並時常參考從業者方面之意見，　屬必要。　決　貿易範圍時，必須辯明　　者資　，至於物價對策，華北與華中之政治，經濟狀　既異，而政治力又有不同，所以今日似　立即糾正，唯物資將會　中強調須　速於同一目標之下加以調整。</p>
<p>統制機構相異之點，亦受指摘。華北統制機構，　　　統制機構成立之時日均淺，自有種種不滿之點，城為無可否認之事實，唯糾正此種缺點，以　促進兩者間之交易的建設性意見，諒係任何人所不得不予以同　者。</p>
<p>在華北與華中，華北及蒙疆等貿易上，現在猶能感到者，厥為地域觀念，地域觀念雖係出於　愛之必然現象，現在共同爭取大東亞戰爭勝利之大目標前，此種觀念似應速即消　。</p>
<p>總之，此與農業會中盡　吐　關於食糧問題之熱烈意見不同，物資交流會各代表之提案，未免稍感沉悶，此或係問題之性質所致　！</p>
<p>熱忱之外繼以實行</p>
<p>各專門會談終了後，關於三專門會中各地代表所提出之各種問題，即於二十九日有關之官民說明，怨談會於　告終，此次北京怨談會，可稱已於成功中閉幕</p>
<p>據小　會　發表之感想，在此中國參戰後之首次會談上，已深感各經濟人之熱誠，倘能將此熱誠付諸實行，努力確立大東亞廣城經濟，即舉行　談會之理由，即將自行產生焉。（吉：譯自十月五日及六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>華北設施</p>
<p>孫主任委員此行感想，日前報紙業有記載，渠對在戰時體制卜之華北各種實施，能有長足之進步，表示十分欽佩。華北近年來一切設施，均有猛烈之進展，　　　問題，比較的甚為嚴重，因為北方雨季全年僅有兩個月，造成天然的灌溉，不足農民生產，因之甚為困難，幸華北當局為解决農田灌漑問題，積極努力於農村鑿井，每口井之深度，規定須四十尺至一百尺，現在四省三市鑿成者，聞已有數萬餘口，將來或可因此一勞永逸，解决民食問題。華北配給機構，甚為完備，且有精密之統計，如天津北京都市均分區配給，平均支配，十分合理化。</p>
<p>麵粉輸出</p>
<p>去年對華北麵粉輪出量，因生產數目較少，故輸出並不甚多，今年收麥成績尙稱滿意，且以本會主持粉麥統妝統配，小麥囤積因之絕跡，各廠均能工作，產量自可增加，將來收買量如能圓滑順利，製成麵粉後，除供給華中需要外，自富儘量輸出華北，俾可對華北民食稍有貢獻。</p>
<p>本市配給</p>
<p>關於本市配給事宜，現正由中日雙筆業者積極組織一新機構，於最短期內，當能依照本會粉　集中配給方案，改善辦理，並在本市當局及商統總會與本會嚴密監督之下，統　配給，決不至因　加。北輸出而影響此間民食。</p>

<p>「亂世佳人」（即「飘」、的電影和小說，早已風靡了全世界，「亂世佳人」搬上舞台消息，也整整　傳了一年，直到今天，總算跟　衆相　了。（苦幹劇團在巴黎大戲院今天作初度獻演）</p>
<p>將「亂世佳人」改編話劇，事實上有可多困難，情節太複雜，內容和塲面太　大，舞台上實在不容易週旋；還有一點，就是電影太成功了，要　足觀衆很不容易，但現在我們終於可以看見舞台上的「亂世佳人」了，這在愛好話劇的觀衆，不能不說是一個喜訊。</p>
<p>這次演出有幾點値得注意：</p>
<p>一苦幹一這名詞，已為話劇　衆所耳熟能詳，但正式組成劇團以雄厚的實力，　　的陣容，正式跟觀衆相見，這却還是第一次，而且是長期義演的性質，（全部收入除開銷外，均將捐助申報助學金）這一點尤其値得同情。</p>
<p>「苦幹」的編導和演員，都是劇壇上的知名之士，這一次「亂世佳人」的演出，差不多是傾其全力，成績自有可觀。</p>
<p>「亂世佳人」雖然是由外國電影和小說改編的，却祗取其動人的情節，此次劇本內容，經過改編，已經是完全中國化了。（劇本曾刋「萬象」雜誌）它以民國十五年左右國民革命一役為時代背景，寫一羣靑年的悲歡離合，這些情形。都是我們所熟如的，自然格外親切有味。</p>
<p>希望愛好話劇的觀衆，不要錯過這大好的機會，欣賞好戲的機會，同時也是推進助學運動的一個好機會。（金允）</p>

<h3 id="c47">各業重評限價以後 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>在戰時民生凋敝之秋，無人不期待着物價之日趨平定，因此，各業評價委員會重行評定限價一舉，自為消費者方　斯樂聞。日來各業公會於重行評訂各種商品限價之餘，尤致力於業規之整飭，　無陽奉陰違情事。我們感覺各　新訂　規中的最後一條：「凡業經評定限價之物品，無論批發或零售商。均須依照評定之限價負責，不得故　，」實尤有擁護之價値，因為，以最近一個時期而論，上海物價之未能普遍地與澈底地趨於平定，非統制機關之不努力，亦非統制機關下之各級機構不努力，祇　於一部份批發商與零售商，尤其是零售商，尙不能脫離追求不法利潤的傾向。</p>
<p>各業重評限價以後之重點，即在於如何掃除「陽奉陰違」的惡習，如果不能掃除的話，那末，重行評　之限價，無論其為如何合理，亦不過　於「盡　」而已。物價統制，原有賴於官民合作，方克冀其成功，而促使成功的工具，尤有賴於法律上與道德上的雙重約束。政府安定物價的種種法令，務須令出法隨，絲毫不假寬貸，這是國家法律對於物價的約束。商人拋棄自私自利的主張，限制營業利潤，藉資造福人羣，這是商人道德對於物價的約束。最近幾個月以來，政府行使特別權力，處置囤積問題，可以說已經收到些顯着的成效。我們切望各業亦能行使特別權力，協助物價政策，務使商人之自治能力與自覺程度，充分發揮，甚至自行檢舉不法行為，以為違犯業規者戒，而尤須牢記勿忘者，則為商人道德——時時顧到消費者的利益，時時想到生活對於一般人的壓迫。</p>

<p>出淵部長首次會見記者</p>
<p>中央社訊　方在滬陸海外三當局聯合舉行之報道常會，昨（十五）日下午三時循例假南京路外灘　中飯店五樓舉行，日陸軍部報道部出淵部長，自接任以來，首次與各報記者會見，並到該部赤星囑托，艦隊報道部松島部長，亦躬親借同鹽田中尉出席，日本大使館上海事務所到廣田情報課長，福間副領事等，首由出淵部長發表日軍佔領廣德及太湖西南地帶戰果，繼由廣田部長答覆記者團詢問之關於最近英葡締結協定，批評頗詳，最後由艦隊報道部松島部長痛　美發言人無聊宣傳，且對日海軍之準備充裕，報導　詳，直至下午五時始畢</p>
<p>出淵部長發表太湖地帶戰果</p>
<p>日在滬陸軍部報道部出淵部長，發表日軍在西南地帶戰果，茲　誌如次</p>
<p>粉碎陰謀</p>
<p>出淵部　首謂一　　大東亞戰爭發生，乃為謀取亞洲民族獲得解放之戰爭，自緬甸獨立後，菲律賓亦實告獨立，正式成立獨立共和國家，反觀反軸心以往之陰謀，業已粉碎殆盡，而在大陸之作戰意義，宛然無異，過去反軸心惡意揑詞誹謗，黨國破壞我方尊嚴，是經我熟識行動，使弱小國家，協力完成獨立，此項卑劣造謠不攻自破，出淵　又謂日　自九月底開始行動，在蘇浙皖區五湖地帶，頗具成效，為表明日軍進攻意旨起見，無論直接間接，在國府軍事政治經濟上協力至鉅，査此次作戰，日軍在太湖西南地帶，不及十日，將　德等重要地區完全佔領，今此戰區已予擴大，並再努力準備作戰目標，現所佔領地區，今後治安當為日軍確立，其面積有一萬五千至一萬六千方公哩，人口達三百萬之多，此龐大面積及繁榮人口，都歸併於和平地區以內國。</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>出淵部長　謂該　帶之情形，本為　第三戰區唯一依糧食糧出產之地，每年生產食米有二千萬包，小麥五百萬包，豆一百五十萬包，其他地質資源，如　　有七百萬噸，煤五千至六千萬噸，此項龐大生產數量驚人，今已完全歸為和平區內資源，巳足使渝慘受打擊，該地前遭渝「忠義救國軍」所　踞，威脅當地徵募給養，　　苛捐雜稅，故人民對「忠義　國軍」康恨急　，自日軍進攻後，大事歡迎，且已有大批人民返歸，該地人民之熱誠歡迎，及迅速恢復治安之最大原因，實因日軍考慮當地實情，因該地肥皂，火柴，　　，棉布等，日用品至為缺之，經予供給生活必需品後　且將該地之大　生產品，予以物資交換，人民安居樂業，無不樂從。出淵部長未謂：「忠義救國軍」已予　潰，當地之治安平靖，故擾亂和平區之英美陰謀從茲粉碎，而該地之米量生產豐富，今後於收買米量時，可得豐富米量，此項生產除供給當地有餘外，且移運供給　　各地，是在和平區內裨益非淺。</p>
<p>松島部長痛斥美人無聊宣傳</p>
<p>報道部松島部長，就最近美國發言人無聊宣傳，加以申斥，松島首指該發言人以最近美機空　大　　，謂日本不予報復，並謂日本在太平洋之實力巳見低弱云云，　松　部長即予斷言，據氏所知，今日海軍已準備下次大戰之　展，在預備下次大戰、乃作沉　準備，俟時機成熟，即展開進攻。最近日海空軍空　印錫　島之事實，由此足見日海軍機安渡印度洋，偵察英軍事根據地，故反軸心之任何惡意宣傳，經視日軍力量、在我人證明完全相反。最後氏引證故東鄕元帥「不言實行」遺　，此乃日本明治年間之至理明言，尤其在日　軍方　最為遵行。末氏乃駁斥反軸心方面在未實行反攻　。恒散布　言，謂反　緬　，或偵察日本本土，以此　無聊宣傳，企圖恐嚇，而在我日本方面，絕不採用此種卑劣手段。</p>
<p>廣田課長談論英葡締結協定</p>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所廣的情　　　於英葡締結亞連　協定事，發表談話：</p>
<p>强迫締約</p>
<p>廣田氏首指英葡此次協定，斷定為英對弱小國家及中立國實行之强迫政　，凡交戰國家，不得利用中立國　為政治根據地，此次英將葡領土亞連爾　島締　協定，實為英利用作為政治根據地，雖英與葡簽訂協定後，一再聲的謂無侵略中立國之行為，其實欲蓋　彰，　人不知完全為侵略行為，但此種行為，在中立國方面是否加以承認，或予違反　約行為，實因被壓迫過甚而承認所致，故我人不能認為葡在自由環境下支持，且英在數月間，使　三　　峻葡政府，利用亞連爾羣島未成，此次英不借用强壓手段　提最後通牒，迫葡政府承認。此種手段，謂無侵略中立國之行為，其誰信之。英利用亞　　　作政治根據地，竟又根據一二七三年間所締結條約提出，在此點上觀，以六百年前之　約，作為證明　　　立塲，故斷定該約難以根據。　田部是你就中立國將領土交給交戰國之利用，分三點解釋，如　永久租借者，　　讓領土者，　　戰者，　葡政府至今未實行上述三點，此次葡將亞速爾　交與英所利用，我人斷言完全違反條約。惟觀葡政　之立塲，我人可認以　難異常，由於誘惑　　，並避免困難作種種準備，在戰時不能避免，但希望葡政府　顧全各方，好自為之才是。</p>
<p>觀測歐勢</p>
<p>廣田情報課長　　答覆記者團所　問，觀測歐洲近勢，氏　反軸心軍今雖有可能在伊倍　亞半島登陸，惟如在法國　接上陸，將受慘　消失，在反軸心方面亦明白預料，而彼利用葡葡牙西班牙參加反軸心，作可能之攻擊，法國本土，關於此點，早為德國所預料，且計劃週密，而德國之防　業基堅如金湯　以是在反軸心任何利用西葡兩國企圖攻擊，當為德易於將軍時情形相較，則今德之防禦與拿破崙當時情形，强數十倍以上，旋廣田氏又解釋二點如下：　在當年拿破崙時，西班牙為拿破崙所佔領，其弟在西之王位，　西民衆之反對，但分西班牙元　　　哥將軍，熱　　護此　德　作戰，且參加軸心陣綫，　　年拿破崙被帝俄擊敗，惟以今之蘇聯自嘗、實力較帝　　强大，而德　巳　付此强有力之蘇　　得　大勝利，由此而　，　軍較拿破崙軍更為强數十倍之多，以是我人將當年拿破崙擊收歷史以　，現今德軍之實力强大，深　絕不　其故事上之覆　。</p>

<h3 id="c55">古砲的發現 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>近代戰爭的利器，沒有一個不是用火藥的。我國本是最先應用火藥的國家，宋朝就已經用之於軍旅，遼代所謂「震天雷」其實就是「砲」的一種。後來這火藥傳到歐洲，西洋人就加以改良，變成了近代的戰爭利器。明祟禎帝曾經命令留華的西洋人造　砲，用為鎭守山海關之用，就是淸代討伐邊陲時也曾用過這種砲。可惜國人泥守舊法，不知加以深究，一直等到西洋人打上了頭，才知道從前人放花砲用的火藥的利害。</p>
<p>北京是明淸各代帝王之都，經過多次的　亂，往往有許多寶物埋藏在地下。最近居然發現了明代的古砲，實在可以讓我們囘想這兵器的源流及我國　受其害的歷史。古砲的發現是偶然的。據報紙所載是：「本市　長街　敦　微生物硏究所，因疏　院內暗溝，發現古砲五　，長約三尺，直徑可八寸，均為鐵質，約係明代遺物，即　　送歷史博物館硏究，按該處係　　　仗局，於數年　　發現古砲多尊，其地下埋藏古物甚夥，故有此次之發　云。」（九月二十九日新北京報）</p>
<p>油荒煤荒</p>
<p>這一年來北京的日用品都曾週期的荒過一陣。去年年底是肥皂荒。　平常的肥皂一小塊居然漲到一元多錢，而且還買不到。後來是布料荒，一尺藍布貴到二三元。今年春天是食糧荒，這荒是一陣一陣的，一直到現在而越加嚴重化。這兩天的報紙上忽然登載當局要大　　　的消息，似乎可以來解決這荒的問題，然而上一次所配給的東西　今仍是有票無處兌，將來的配給如何實不敢過於樂觀。不過着隨防疫大關城門之後而奇漲的　　，這兩天確是已經下降了，　　　週期中的一個段落。前此日子，肥皂忽然落了價，而製造肥皂的　　大　而　貴，最近　　　荒　油荒和煤荒。油　括有脂肪油和植物油兩者。北京人早就不大吃猪肉了。過了中秋，肉價又從一斤四元上下漲判七元以上，而日是跑了十家總有九家沒有肉　的。植物油的高漲由是很可觀的。節前是一斤花生油三元八角，現在已經快要漲到六元了。而且各油坊都不願意　，要買上五斤就不容易，煤本來是北　的土產，可是近來也是　的現象。煤價兩個月以前還是毎百斤二元四角，現在却漲到四元左右了，大約不久的將來，煤球也將變成難得的禮品了。這週期的荒很　明　指　荒的原因是囤積的作祟，不然的話，絕不能忽而有忽而無。不知當局對此有澈底的辦法否？</p>
<p>交通恢復</p>
<p>因為澈底的防止虎疫，　北當　下令關　北京，各城門，只有一二城門是在軍　森嚴戒備之下半開着。同時又下令不許人民在北京各站乘車。這種措　曾給許多造　　　的人一些活動的機會，於是日來的北京城各種謠言都有。甚至於極其可笑的　言也有人造出。這幾天刮了幾陣秋風，天氣總算是大形寒冷了，因此虎疫的氣焰也就　殺了許多。據報上的消息，這三日來患虎疫者只有七人，因此　別的防疫措　就不必要，而當局也就下令自十月一日起開放城門，而各路火車也就可以自由乘車了。（十月六日）</p>

<h3 id="c56">高速當舖利息 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 小</p>
<p>連日來評定蔬菜價格，配給日用物品；消息傳來，給市民莫大的興奮與慰安，貧苦民衆：能以略事喘息，至少不再日加緊壓透不過氣；當局關懷民瘼，對國民經濟直下措施，令人欽敬。貫澈實行，以蘇民困，獲惠不淺。但赤貧們被經濟的剝削（靈轉不通）還不曾稍予减除。</p>
<p>昨日，一個窮親戚來說，為了買一斗米，當去了幾件夾棉衣服，得了二百元儲鈔，四月前，二百元正好買一斗米，四月後的現在，　索寒擻，勢將加衣，拿着薪金的一部分將其贖囘；贖價一算，超過了他薪津的四分之一，由二百元變成了二百七十二元八角了。</p>
<p>他說：「為之調用」斗米，奉送了四升（市價），窮人的日子　不好過。』</p>
<p>這七十幾元的利息是太大了，我問他是如何算法的，他說：『「當扣」一成，月息六分，「當扣」是等於「佣金」或「手续費」隨時加上算息的，所以票面變做二百廿元，一齊照六分月息計算，四個月，不是加上五十二元八角，變為二百七十二元八角嗎？而我僅實收二百元。』</p>
<p>「這是多麽可怕！富人們米，煤，油，那一樣不是整担整噸的向家中貯藏？低價購進，漲價無礙，平民零星購取，漲價吃虧，靈轉不通，還要再吃高利貸的剝削！」他說完，又指出某人家還吃的七十元一　的米，某人家家中堆有一二十担煤球。</p>
<p>我歎了口氣。</p>
<p>他是一個守本分的職業生活者，他受過高等教育，戰前，他的收入，一家開支外還有餘存，戰後，他吃完貼光，每月虧負累累。他不會脫去長衫，他更無錢囤積，他無法做官，又好體面，不肯向人借錢，他仍自以為幸，就是他還不曾遭受着失業。</p>
<p>他是一個十足的隱言者，戰爭破壊了整個的國民經濟　造成了無數的赤貧，難民，以及甚多的隱貧，僅有極少數的成為暴富。無用諱言，正有不　的人，穿着長衫，像他一樣的患着「貧」病，貧而不肯開口貸借，而日用又不能减少一個。</p>
<p>我又想起了赤貧的老弱，工人，下層的生活者，失業　。因之，我更重視了當舖，調節民問經濟的當舖。</p>
<p>賢明的社會福利部當局，創議設立公益典當。想還沒有注意高利盤剝的現况下的當舖內幕。這裏，我特提高着喉嚨，請當舖老闆們慈悲些，不要加重中下階級經濟的緊壓，救救貧民。並盼　社會福利部及市政當局的先生們，早日取締並予規定或調整，以解民倒懸！</p>
<h3 id="c57">對新路名的小意見 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>這次改正路名辦法，令人甚感滿意；第一：人名路名無論　　　　　　銷，一律改用地名路名。第二；在一直綫上之不同地名，予以合併，如地豐路，麥琪路，巨福路，一體改稱迪化路；淡水路，　坡賽路，併稱南通路；馬　路，貝勒路，併稱　陂路；白爾部路接為重慶路，貝　　路接入成都路等。</p>
<p>但准此原則，後列各路，　無分立必要，實應併為一名，以便於記　：　天主　街應接入四川路，不必另立天合路；　吉祥街應接入江西路，不必　名定南路。　老北門街應接入河南路，不必另立長白路；　麥底安路應接為山東路，不必另立　城路；　　家木橋街應併入福建路，不必另名永泰路；　新橋街應併為浙江路，不必另名紫陽路；　西目來火街應接入廣西路，不必另立桂　路；　八里橋路應併入雲南路，不必的另名永平路。至如　很　的龍門路，亟應與定定路（麥高包　路）合併，　咸陽路（亞爾　路）與祁門路（西摩路），　　茂名路（慕爾鳴路）與桂林路（邁爾西愛路），　　富民路（古　路）與　湖路（　美路），　　南海路（福　　路）與廣元路（台斯德郞路），　　　　路（敏　尼蔭路）與安徽路（　維藹路），　　正陽路（同孚路）與黃山路（金　父路），象山路（聖母院路），均為一直綫之路，亦均應合併為一名。</p>
<p>此外，有幾　以為可以無須改動者：如鴨綠路之改名珠江路，秋意則以鴨綠江更有歷史的義意。又如靑浦路之改　津路，虬江路之改淸河路，似均不如原舊。至博物院路之改虎邱路，亦以為無甚必　。</p>
<p>到是未改名的直隸路，似乎封建氣味太甚，應改為河北路才是，奉　路應否改為遼　路，亦堪吟味。又江陰路（孟德蘭路）似記得南市已有，不知是否雷同？再則西臨安路（　自爾路）與金陵路（法大馬路），係一直綫，亦應合併，且全部路名中並無臨安路，西臨安之西字，不知是否有誤，殊屬疑點。（白虹）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>一八兩區路　於十月十日已正式發表更改，由此足見市府對收囘租界的决心和澈底路名更改，路牌自然亦必更易；乘此間隙之時，願以一市民之資格略進一二言。</p>
<p>往昔一八兩區門牌上祇有號數而沒有路名，這在識路者自然沒有什麽問題，不過在不熟識路由的人便很感不便，盼於認路牌外兼注意及此，最　　度當多設路牌，並於每塊路牌上兼注前後二路的名稱。</p>
<p>上海除一八兩區外，還有許多地方的路政亟待改良，如南市除中華民國二路外，幾無「像樣」點的路。狹小崎嶇兼而有之；有的甚至不像一條路。南市的房屋大部已毀，宜乘此機會劃定路界，不特放　路面，還從而加以整治。路政既經改良，環境自然也較優美，那麽被毀的房屋，原主也必樂於建造了。此複興南市的先決條件，其注意之。（氓）</p>

<p>The recent takeover of the Shanghai concessions and the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government are both excellent opportunities to reform politics. This newspaper has reviewed the past and discussed the future, hoping that the government authorities will value this opportunity, seize it, and bring politics back on the right track to fulfill the era's mission of our Chinese nation. It is an undeniable fact that the corruption of Chinese politics has led to the darkness of society and the depravity of the nation. This has been the case for a long time, and it is becoming more severe today. Therefore, listing the points for reform is truly an endless task. Even if we outline the main points and elaborate on the obvious ones, it is still difficult to express them fully. The concluding sentence of this newspaper's editorial on August 16th, "When public opinion reaches the top, talents are excellent, and officialdom is rectified, Shanghai will be well-governed," serves as the outline for building a new Shanghai and a major prerequisite for building a new China. However, it has been more than two months since the takeover of the Shanghai concessions. Although the time is still short and we cannot expect too much, the impression from the perspective of the citizens is not "greatly disappointed." Yet, there is still no sign of fulfilling the aforementioned simplest three points. Thus, it is clear that reversing the overwhelming tide cannot be achieved overnight. It is necessary to trace the root causes, first cultivate spiritual strength, and then seek restoration. Therefore, with pure sincerity, we offer further humble suggestions.</p>
<p>Every nation with a position in the world must have its own precious traditional spirit, relying on it as an invisible weapon to defend its national life. If, unknowingly, it is affected and loses its inherent traditional spirit, the nation will inevitably be corrupted and humiliated, gradually leading to decline and extinction. This is what is meant by "events have inevitable causes and reasons have inherent principles." Our Chinese nation has a culture of over four thousand years, and it also has its own moving and tearful historical records. Its prosperity has always been when its traditional spirit is promoted and developed. Its decline has always been when its traditional spirit is destroyed and lost. Past events and traces can be examined in detail. Because its history is long and wise men emerge in large numbers, it has established concrete models in all aspects that are worthy of respect. The fundamental traditional spirit of politics is "correcting oneself."</p>
<p>Being strict with oneself and lenient with others is the beginning of correcting oneself. Cultivating oneself, regulating one's family, governing the country, and pacifying the world is the ultimate goal of correcting oneself. Politics means correctness. If the ruler leads with correctness, who would dare to be incorrect? If one is upright, orders will be followed without being issued. If one is not upright, orders will not be followed even if issued. This is why it explains the effectiveness of correcting oneself to influence others. Ruler should act like a ruler, minister like a minister, father like a father, and son like a son. This is why it explains the mutual benefits of correcting oneself. Since ancient times, words expounding on correcting oneself are sufficient to illustrate its essence. They are recorded in the classics and cannot be listed one by one. However, knowing without acting is of no help.</p>
<p>Correcting oneself involves training one's normal thoughts and correct concepts, not being swayed by the temptations of sensory pleasures, wealth, or threats of torture. Therefore, one can firmly establish lofty aspirations, cultivate a noble spirit, expanding to fill the universe and shrinking to fit within an inch. Thus, one can cultivate oneself in poverty and benefit the world in prosperity. From this, one can practice a life of frugality and simplicity, work hard to manage the world and benefit things, cultivate character, promote reputation, and not be moved by praise or blame, gain or loss, life or death, fortune or misfortune. Then, one can make decisive choices between taking and giving, entering and leaving office, without being casual. Only when inner thoughts match outward actions, and words match deeds, can one talk about politics. Politics originally means correcting oneself and then regulating the people. "Zheng" (政) is the cause, and "zhi" (治) is the effect. Without first seeking "zheng," there is no way to talk about "zhi."</p>
<p>The cultivation of correcting oneself is not as difficult, profound, or unattainable as generally imagined. However, those below average lack unwavering perseverance and firm intentions, and are easily assimilated by the environment. In an era of clear politics and honest society, even vendors and porters know to examine their words and deeds, fearing being despised by their peers. As for the scholar-officials, they dare not indulge in unrestrained behavior, lest they bring disgrace and ruin upon themselves. Therefore, in the past, it was often heard that officials spent their entire lives in office, returning home without funds and dying without coffins or burial arrangements. They not only did not feel ashamed of this poverty, but also took pride in their incorruptibility. They set an example for their wives and influenced their brothers, spreading throughout the community and inspiring their descendants, subtly influencing and becoming customary. They deeply understood that officials are public servants, with the idea of service as the center, and even more knew that as parents of the people, they should love the people as their official duty. From correcting oneself comes frugality, and from frugality comes integrity. Thus, one can always be brave and resolute, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and harmony. When the world declines and morality wanes, people forget righteousness for profit, national titles are treated like commodities, and officials themselves take maximizing profits as their premise and forming factions for personal gain as the principle of their careers. Extravagance and licentiousness become the standard for official rank. One can accumulate vast fortunes in a few months in office. If one doesn't, one can't flatter superiors and look down on colleagues. Superiors follow suit and everyone envies each other. Therefore, entering officialdom is like falling into a deep abyss. Some cannot pull themselves out, some excuse themselves by the actions of others, some underestimate themselves and do not take it upon themselves to change customs, or some intend to hold office briefly and do not want to encourage or afflict themselves, sitting idly by for the opportunity to be promoted and make a fortune. This is because the cultivation of correcting oneself is not deep enough, and the ability to control oneself is weak, insufficient to speak of foolishness in a lawless country. Weaknesses are exposed, and evil and chaos take advantage. Thus, superiors and subordinates collude, and officials and the people all tend to fall. Everything avoids the path of righteousness, seeking to fulfill private and obscure intentions. In this way, seeking public opinion to reach the top, excellent talents, and rectified officialdom is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is difficult. Furthermore, the sea of desire is hard to fill, and private greed has no limit, leading to bribery and corruption, which becomes commonplace. Some half-heartedly go along, boasting of not revealing traces. Some avoid the heavy and seek the light, seeking forgiveness by protecting themselves wisely. Their hearts contradict their words, and they try to cover up but only expose more. Some even sell official positions and titles, with their wives profiting from it. Some are tyrannical and violent, relying on their factions to intimidate others. Even if it is not personally instructed, one should be held accountable for negligence. In reality, if one is not upright, then the family is not regulated. Rotting things breed insects, and there is a gradual progression from the small to the large.</p>
<p>Today's society has accumulated deep-seated problems. There are many who are unwilling to abandon darkness and turn to light, clinging to their illegal power. They will inevitably take any despicable means, exerting all their strength to resist the trend of political reform, striving to make those in power lose heart, become discouraged, and retreat in the face of difficulties. Therefore, all those with aspirations, whether in or out of office, should gather together as soon as possible, cultivate the thorough practice of correcting oneself, nurture a strong and fearless spirit, vow to be irreconcilable with demons and monsters, eradicate all the scum that endangers the survival of the nation, overcome all obstacles that hinder the renewal of political reform, and restore the traditional spirit of politics of our Chinese nation. Then, all kinds of problems can be solved easily. Otherwise, there is no talk of reforming politics, let alone the national mission.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Japan-Philippines Exchange Broadcast Last Night <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japan-Philippines exchange broadcast celebrating Philippine independence began at 7:30 PM on the 15th with the playing of the Philippine national anthem. First, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan delivered a congratulatory speech, followed by a speech of thanks from the new President of the Philippines, Laurel. The Japanese national anthem was then played, and the broadcast ended at 8:00 PM. The contents of the broadcasts by Prime Minister Tojo and President Laurel are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech: "The Philippines declared its independence on October 14th of this year and became a completely independent nation within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I am deeply delighted. His Excellency Laurel, endorsed by the public opinion of the entire nation, has assumed the office of the first President of the Philippines. It is self-evident how joyfully the 18 million people of the Philippines will greet this glorious day, and I hereby express my heartfelt congratulations. Looking back, more than forty years ago, the Philippines was about to gain independence through the efforts of patriots such as Rizal. At that time, the United States had agreed to establish a volunteer army for the Philippines, but the result was that the Filipino people were turned into docile subjects of the United States. For more than forty years, the Filipino people have endured and continued to struggle. As a result, the United States first baited them with autonomy and then promised independence. The so-called independence of the United States was actually to protect its own economic interests and use this to deceive and exploit the Filipino people. I am sure that the Filipino nation will be fully aware of this, and there is no need for further explanation. Furthermore, the United States, relying on its material strength, deceived and drugged the Filipino people and used the Philippines as a base to oppress and exploit East Asia, in order to fulfill its insatiable ambition to dominate the world. In the meantime, Japan, for the sake of establishing peace in East Asia through peaceful means, endured for many years until recently. However, in order to eliminate the source of trouble disrupting East Asia, it was finally forced to resort to military force on December 8th of the year before last. Thanks to the majestic power of the Emperor and the loyalty and skillful combat of the soldiers, the American forces occupying the Philippines were completely wiped out. In less than two years, the Philippines has completed various preparations and, based on the position of East Asians, has achieved the long-awaited true independence under an ideal. This is truly a cause for common celebration for the Philippines and for Greater East Asia. Indeed, the independence of the Philippines requires the completion of the Greater East Asia War to achieve its independence goal. Japan will provide full cooperation for the development and prosperity of the Philippines. Therefore, I hope that the people of the Philippines, under the guidance of His Excellency President Laurel, will work harder in the future to strengthen themselves, restore the true spirit of the Greater East Asian nations, and devote themselves to the defense of their country and the establishment of a wartime posture. It will become an independent country, an integral part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and closely cooperate with Japan and other countries in Greater East Asia to build Greater East Asia. Currently, the countries of Greater East Asia are cooperating with Japan to achieve the common goal of liberating Greater East Asia and building a moral world. Now that the Philippine Republic has been born, adding a new country to the Greater East Asia nations, it is truly worthy of celebration. Japan deeply expects to cooperate with these countries, work wholeheartedly, and achieve the great ideal of universal prosperity."</p>
<p>President Laurel's Broadcast Speech: "The Philippine Republic declared its independence yesterday and held the ceremony for the establishment of the Philippine Republic. The independence of the Philippines is the long-cherished wish and highest aspiration of our Filipino people, and it has finally been achieved. This is truly a gift from the Empire of Japan. On behalf of all the Filipino people, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Prime Minister Tojo and the people of Japan. The smooth progress of all preparations and measures prior to the independence of the Philippines was due to the frequent cooperation and comprehensive assistance of the Japanese Army and Navy. We can only express our deep gratitude here. I hereby firmly declare our commitment to cooperate with the great cause of liberating the peoples of Greater East Asia that is currently underway. The future of the Philippine Republic faces many difficulties. However, we hope that the Philippines will become a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and will be able to find its place in the society of free nations in the world. We will bravely move forward."</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Philippine Republic Plans to Establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Laurel Discusses His Aspirations <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new President of the Philippine Republic, Mr. Laurel, met with a group of reporters at his official residence at 11:30 AM on the 14th and discussed his aspirations. The main points are as follows: "I am deeply grateful for the goodwill of the Japanese government. The Philippines is now one of the nations of the world. Therefore, we have already sent independence telegrams to the diplomatic authorities of China, Thailand, Burma, Manchukuo, Germany, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, Spain, Denmark, Finland, the Soviet Union, the Irish Free State, Turkey, Afghanistan, Argentina, France, Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, hoping that all countries will recognize us as soon as possible. We have sent a special telegram to Prime Minister Tojo on the Japanese side, thanking the officials and people of Japan for their deep sympathy and convenience given to the Philippines. What we should start with now is domestic issues, among which self-sufficiency in daily necessities and the implementation of fair distribution are the most urgent tasks at present. As a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the new Philippines must first help the people of its country so that it no longer troubles Japan. The first thing the Philippine government must decide is the direction of the policy, followed by making it concrete, and finally putting it into practice. At this initial stage of taking office, it is not yet possible to announce all the policies, but the plans include: establishing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs; assisting the poor, especially widows and orphans caused by the war; and granting amnesty to political prisoners. At the same time, there are plans to increase the salaries of officials. In short, in order to make the Philippines a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the first thing to do is to stabilize the lives of the people so that they deeply feel the happiness of independence. I hope that all the people will understand this point and give the new country full support and encouragement."</p>
<p>National Assembly to Convene the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the declaration of independence of the Philippines, in order to promote domestic construction, a special National Assembly will be convened here on the 18th.

Centered on this, important strategies for nation-building will be reviewed. President Laurel will request the Congress to approve the Japan-Philippines Alliance Treaty concluded on the 14th. The international status and domestic construction projects of the Philippine Republic will have rapid and major progress.</p>
<p>Philippines is Preparing to Establish a Central Bank</p>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the independence of the Philippine Republic, in order to establish a new currency system and improve and expand financial institutions, the Philippine Central Bank will be established as soon as possible.

During the transition period before the establishment of the central bank, the new government will temporarily provide funds from the Southern Development Gold Vault, Philippine branch, and recognize the circulation of the old peso banknotes and military tickets.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Government of Manchukuo received President Laurel's telegram announcing the independence of the Philippine Republic on the 14th, it convened an emergency State Council meeting on the morning of the 15th and decided to officially recognize the country.

<p>Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Government of Manchukuo officially recognized the Philippine Republic, Manchukuo and the Philippines have entered the first stage of amicable relations. In its declaration of independence, the Philippine Republic has already clarified its determination to restore the original appearance of Asia and contribute to the construction of a new world order as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its relationship with Manchukuo, which has the ideal of building a moral world, will also be clearly established through this official recognition, and it will advance with its allied countries in the fight against Britain and the United States. Manchukuo and the Philippines are located in the north and south of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their economic characteristics are indeed different. However, due to the relationship between their production materials, they will be combined into a cooperative relationship in the future economy, with mutual adaptation. Therefore, the close cooperation between the two countries in the future is particularly promising.</p>

<p>Full Text of Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The graduation ceremony for the first class of students from the Central Military Academy was grandly held at the Central Military Academy on the 15th. Chairman Wang, who also serves as the President of the Academy, personally attended and delivered instructions. The original text of the instructions is respectfully recorded as follows: "Today is the graduation of the first class of students from the Central Military Academy, and the opening ceremony of the Reserve Officer Training Class of the Army Teaching Corps and the personnel training class of the General Supervision Office of Management. It is a great honor to have guests from allied nations Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany participating. Since the opening of the military school, thanks to the enthusiastic leadership of the School Affairs Committee members, Secretary-General He, Education Director Liu, and all the faculty members, the dedicated assistance of the military advisors, and the students' hard work and diligence, we have achieved today's results, which I find deeply gratifying.</p>
<p>I recall that in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), when the Central Military Academy was established in Whampoa and held the opening ceremony for the first class of students, the Founding Father personally attended and delivered instructions, and ordered me to write a congratulatory speech. Later, it was made into a military song and then into the national anthem. The national anthem that we sing now is that congratulatory speech. Thinking back, it is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony of the first class of students at the Whampoa Central Military Academy, the Founding Father passed away in less than two years, and the East River Rebellion broke out. The students had not yet completed their graduation before rushing to the battlefield to fulfill their military missions, and some of them even sacrificed their lives for the country. You have been educated here for two years and will enter the Reserve Officer Training Class for training after graduating today. At this time of national difficulty and hardship, how grateful you should be to be able to study calmly."</p>

Upon receiving the report, the Japanese army immediately engaged them, engaging in fierce fighting near Shahe, inflicting heavy damage and heavy casualties on the Communist bandits. Almost completely annihilated.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – A certain base of the Japanese army on the Burma Front, 15th, reported that on the afternoon of the 14th, enemy forces used eleven B-24 type bombers to attack Yangon. Japan's new elite fighter squadron immediately dispatched to intercept them, repeatedly launching fierce attacks, shooting down one above Bassein and hitting another five with bullets. Black smoke billowed as they fled in panic. It is believed that these enemy aircraft, due to the heavy damage sustained, will certainly crash into the sea. In this battle, the Japanese army also lost one plane. At this difficult time for the country, how encouraged should we be to study.</p>
<p>Realizing Pan-Asianism</p>
<p>Military academies have a long history, and military academy students have progressed from one stage to another, with Zizhuo doing his best for the nation and the people. The life of the nation and the people is infinite, while individual life is limited. What is called history is a continuous record of progress. Progress depends on people at each stage of the historical process putting in decades of effort, like pebbles and grains of sand paving a road. The hearts and blood of people born in each historical stage, connected together, become a scroll of history. The students of the military academy in previous periods have already fulfilled their tasks, like sand and stones that have already paved sections of the road. The current section is even greater than before, and there is light shining in front, guiding us to step onto it. What is this light? It is the liquidation of the hundred-year-old Anglo-American aggression. I hope that former military academy students will return one after another, and everyone will step onto this only bright road for China.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the Bright Road</p>
<p>Now, there are two roads before us, one is bright, the unity of the East Asian nations, and the other is dark, allowing Anglo-American aggression to continue. We must not take the second road. On January 9th of this year, the National Government participated in the war, and China and Japan signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, which have now been realized. The Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations will also be revised soon. It is deeply believed that from now on, there will be no more disunity within China. Step onto this bright road, everyone. Former students must also step onto it, and future students will definitely follow.</p>
<p>Now we are facing such a great era, such a glorious historical stage. You should continue the knowledge and experience gained from two years of hard work, perseverance, bravery, and diligence, continue the efforts of the comrades who have already sacrificed themselves, and guide the later comrades to continue their efforts, and take on the mission of this school. Now, the revival of China and the protection of East Asia have moved from the theoretical stage to the practical stage. I wish you all good health, and I wish you all the fulfillment of the great responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 15th that after repelling the invading Soviet forces, they had withdrawn from Chapuruji (Zaboroiye) downstream of the Dnieper River. The German Command had moved heavy weapons, various vehicles, and other large quantities of military supplies to the west bank of the Dnieper River the afternoon before the withdrawal. On that evening, under the cover of rear guard troops, German troops withdrew to the west bank and thoroughly destroyed the dam there. The German rear guard troops also retreated by speedboat that night and were not pursued by the Soviet army.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – A report from the Overseas News Agency stated: Yesterday afternoon, there were fierce air battles over western and southwestern Germany. Ninety enemy aircraft were shot down, proving a significant setback for the enemy. German fighter planes intercepted and severely attacked the enemy aircraft. Most of the enemy aircraft destroyed were four-engine bombers. The enemy lost one thousand highly trained pilots yesterday. The attacking enemy aircraft were deceived by German fighter planes and could not approach their targets to carry out precision strikes. A German squadron pursuing a group of enemy aircraft (25 planes) achieved an astonishing result, shooting down no fewer than 20 enemy planes, with only five escaping. Most of the enemy pilots and planes were destroyed, and a few survivors were captured.</p>
<p>Another report stated that this morning, a reconnaissance flight by German aircraft discovered several more American aircraft that had been shot down. Therefore, the number of aircraft shot down has increased to 123, and this number may increase further.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the issue of the Portuguese Azores Islands supplying the British and American armies as military bases, the Japanese government instructed its envoy to Portugal, Ambassador Mori, on the 15th to protest to the Portuguese government. It pointed out that the Portuguese government's allowance of British and American forces, enemies of Japan, to go to the Azores Islands and use the island's military bases constitutes a violation of the obligations of a neutral country. The Japanese government, upon hearing that Britain and Portugal had signed an agreement, consulted with the German government and decided to make serious representations to the Portuguese government. It has been found that Britain has violated Portugal's neutrality for the second time. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the Japanese army occupied Timor Island in the Netherlands, the British and American forces violated the neutrality of Portuguese Timor and attempted to turn the island into a military base. Therefore, the Japanese army immediately cleared out the British and American forces to prevent them from violating Portugal's neutrality.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that the German government, through the German ambassador to Portugal, protested to the Portuguese government yesterday for violating its neutrality by placing the Azores Islands under British control. The German government also declared that it reserves the right to take certain measures as a result of this incident.</p>

A certain army corps, with a force of three divisions, has concentrated in the exercise area. The Ministry of the Army's communiqué forcefully stated that the preparations for the exercises have been satisfactorily completed. The exercises will be led by the president of the Portuguese Military Academy, with General Machado leading three divisions of troops to participate.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Böllner, a special correspondent of the German News Agency in the Mediterranean region, reported that the only important battle in Italy last week occurred on the eastern side of the German defense line, especially in the coastal area of Termoli and the nearby western mountains. However, the situation is different this week. The British army is now pressing towards the German front line north of Naples with increased strength. After the British army transferred a large number of heavy artillery units to positions north of Aversa and in the Capua area, they launched a fierce offensive against the German positions on the north bank of the Volturno River. This military operation was covered in the coastal area by artillery batteries stationed on several anti-Axis warships anchored off the mouth of the Volturno River. After fierce fighting, the British army gained a foothold in several strongholds on the east bank of the river and forced the German army to retreat. The German army launched a counteroffensive under effective artillery cover, attempting to drive the British army to the opposite bank of the river, or to confine them to a small area, so that they would no longer be able to use the remaining bridgehead for large-scale military operations. When the German forces attacked an enemy bridgehead, a British regiment was completely wiped out, and hundreds of prisoners of war fell into German hands. British tanks only penetrated the German defense line in one place, near Capua. At the same time, in the Callere area near the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the German positions are holding firm.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hansen of the German News Agency Navy stated that on Wednesday, Soviet aircraft unsuccessfully attacked a German convoy off the northern coast of Norway, and four were shot down. The enemy used a new method of launching torpedoes for the first time, but the result was a complete failure. In the first fruitless attack, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and the remaining bombers were repelled. Soon after, a squadron of enemy torpedo planes appeared over the German convoy again and dropped three torpedoes from a height of about 2,000 meters using parachutes. It was not difficult for the German ships to evade these torpedoes. The Soviets apparently intended to use this new method to avoid losing aircraft. After the first two attempts failed, the third attempt was to launch a low-altitude attack with torpedoes, but again failed to hit the target. During the attack on the German convoy, the torpedoes hit two German protection ships, both of the "Boston" type.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's News Agency: American newspapers believe that Portugal can serve as a model for other neutral countries. Swedish newspapers wrote articles opposing this, stating briefly that the New York Times declared that Sweden and Turkey clearly want to join the Allied side, but are afraid and have not thought about the timing when the time has ripened. These remarks are very straightforward, and we also have the right and obligation to make the same straightforward remarks, stating that it is impossible to realize their wish and join the victorious side. The goal of Swedish foreign policy remains to enable the country to pass through the war period without suffering damage.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Third East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference: An Overview <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Significance of the Roundtable Conference</p>
<p>The third East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference, held in Beijing at the Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai, commenced on September 27th and lasted for three days. This conference was the first since China's entry into the war, and the atmosphere at the venue was filled with sincerity. The ardent desire of various economic figures for the victory of the Greater East Asia War was clearly perceptible. Moreover, the conference featured more constructive opinions than previous sessions, a welcome phenomenon. However, the original mission of the roundtable conference was to mutually understand economic situations in various aspects to enhance war power. In other words, it was passive in nature. Therefore, no matter what constructive opinions were offered, they were only that, resulting in a sense of inadequacy. This, however, stemmed from the original nature of the roundtable conference. As a result, the nature of the conference was inherently different from other meetings where the problems raised for discussion could be immediately implemented. Therefore, the failure to implement the proposals made at the roundtable conference was unavoidable.</p>
<p>During the first Beijing Roundtable Conference, Chinese speakers accounted for the absolute majority. Japanese figures listened to the requests and opinions of Chinese economic figures and reflected them in policy. Some individuals with this experience criticized the fact that there were fewer Chinese speakers at this conference. However, in today's context of actively enhancing war power through Sino-Japanese unity, it is more meaningful for Japanese economic figures to discuss in detail how Chinese and Japanese economic figures in the local area are active and what common economic difficulties they face, rather than adopting the so-called method of listening to the voices of Chinese economic figures to achieve results.</p>
<p>Although one cannot definitively say that viewing the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference as a social gathering renders it nominal, if Japanese mainland economic figures and local economic figures can openly and honestly express their hopes, demands, and difficulties, and if they can be incorporated into economic development and war power enhancement, then we have no reason to endorse the argument that the roundtable conference is useless.</p>
<p>Resource and Labor Issues</p>
<p>During the first day's mining and industrial section meeting, the focus was on how to break through bottlenecks to increase production. The development of important resources such as iron, coal, and bauxite is indispensable for Japan's enhancement of war power. Although the authorities in North China and Mengjiang are currently striving to increase production, the lack of resources and labor problems are clearly hindering the increase in these materials. For example, the increase in coal and iron production and transportation volume is hampered by the inability to obtain more resources for massive production increases. Representatives from various regions repeatedly raised this situation and expressed their desire to transfer idle equipment from mainland Japan and Korea to local areas, with a considerable number of requests.</p>
<p>As for the labor issue, the fundamental problem lies in the food issue. Moreover, labor management of North China laborers is not yet fully developed. Although this is a key to solving the labor problem, local labor management is not easy. However, if left to its own devices, the labor problem will never be resolved. Therefore, voices calling for labor management were frequently heard at the mining and industrial conference.</p>
<p>Local Development of Light Industry</p>
<p>As for light industry, although the improvement of Japanese mainland enterprises has had a positive impact on local light industry, it would be difficult to assume that the gradual relocation of idle equipment to local areas would lead to the development of local light industry, as the actual situation is not that simple. Even if Japan's mainland implements enterprise restructuring, there is no immediate reason to move a large number of idle facilities to North China or Mengjiang. Moreover, from the perspective of the government authorities, a plan cannot be established without comprehensively considering the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it seems difficult to resolve everything as simply as local financial figures hope.</p>
<p>However, when purchasing food requires a large exchange of goods, local light industry is clearly a good performer if it can be manufactured locally. This point has been mentioned not only at the roundtable conference but also seems to be fully recognized in Tokyo. However, not only personnel but also local assistance is needed for the development of light industry.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry Deliberation Organ</p>
<p>As for the chemical industry, centered on soda and acid industries using salt as raw materials, industries such as glass, oil, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and paper can be cited. Although the chemical industry in North China is centered in the Tianjin area, which controls the Changlu salt fields, and the Qingdao area, which centers on the Shandong salt fields, its development in North China is slower than other industries, due to a shortage of electricity, resources, and funds. At this time, when advancing towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to promote the development of the chemical industry and to establish a local self-sufficiency system for soda and acids. Therefore, the conference also emphasized this. The Qingdao representative advocated the establishment of a chemical industry deliberation organ to integrate local technical groups to develop this industry, which attracted considerable attention.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the issue of electricity development, Naito, the vice president of the North China Electric Power Company, raised the Yellow River power generation project, which attracted attention. Mr. Naito strongly stated that as long as there is a passion for effort, the lack of resources can be overcome, delivering a stern rebuke to the economic figures who argued that production cannot be increased due to a lack of resources and who frequently mentioned resources. This seemed to be the most noteworthy point at the mining and industrial conference.</p>
<p>Resolving the Food Problem</p>
<p>After the first day's mining and industrial conference, the agricultural conference was held on the morning of the second day, followed by the continuation of the materials exchange conference in the afternoon.</p>
<p>At the agricultural conference, the most pressing issue was to alleviate the burden on farmers, which is a fundamental condition for increasing agricultural production. If farmers' burdens are not actually reduced through mere lip service, increased production is hopeless. Currently, the burden on North China farmers is already too heavy. This is partly due to the fact that the administration of the North China Political Affairs Commission has not fully penetrated the rural areas. However, the biggest reason is the heavy taxation on North China farmers. In addition to the taxes levied by the central government, they must pay various other taxes. This point must be corrected first. Secondly, consideration should be given to determining the purchase price of agricultural products based on production costs, in order to adjust them with general materials. Many of the attending representatives advocated this, which was the central focus of the agricultural conference. From beginning to end, the consistent theme was to reduce the burden on farmers, which is no exaggeration. This proposal is bound to have a strong response among the local and Greater East Asia authorities present, giving many hints for future implementation of policies.</p>
<p>As Chairman Ogi stated after the conference, the food problem arising in North China is not just a North China problem, but a food problem for China, Japan, and Manchukuo as a whole. Therefore, the solution to this problem cannot be achieved by each locality working independently, but must be solved through the joint cooperation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Coal, iron, , bauxite, cotton, etc., are not only important resources for North China, but also important resources for the Greater East Asia wide area. While the resources of the South have not yet been fully utilized, the importance of resources in North China and Mengjiang is self-evident. When increasing the amount of these resources, the problem that must be solved is the food problem. Considering that reducing the burden on farmers is the key to solving the food problem proposed by the agricultural conference, will the governing authorities fully consider the voices of the various economic figures at the conference and reflect them in their policies?</p>
<p>Establishment of a Standing Committee</p>
<p>At the materials exchange conference in the afternoon, many constructive opinions were expressed, such as the desire to establish a specialized committee to strengthen land transportation capacity and remove obstacles to trade, strengthen coordination with Japan, and promote trade. According to the Tianjin representative, the obstacles to domestic trade in China today are: first, that sea and land transportation is not fully implemented according to plan; and second, that the price policies between the two regions (i.e., North China and Central China) have different objectives.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of sea and land transportation according to plan, North China Transportation is at the center, and although it is guided by the instructions of the military authorities and the embassy to ensure that there are no regrets, from the perspective of economic figures engaged in specialized trade, there are still shortcomings, which is the problem. Therefore, as stated by the Tianjin representative, it is necessary to establish a standing committee and frequently consult the opinions of those engaged in the field. When determining the scope of trade, the qualifications of the operators must be clarified. As for price policies, the political and economic situations in North China and Central China are different, and the political forces are also different, so it seems difficult to correct them immediately. However, it was emphasized at the materials conference that adjustments must be made quickly under the same objective.</p>
<p>The differences in control mechanisms were also pointed out. There is no denying the fact that the control mechanisms in North China and the control mechanisms are newly established and there are various points of dissatisfaction. However, constructive opinions to correct these shortcomings and promote trade between the two are something that anyone must agree with.</p>
<p>In trade between North China and Central China, North China, and Mengjiang, what can still be felt now is the concept of region. Although the concept of region is an inevitable phenomenon arising from love, in the face of the great goal of jointly striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, this concept should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, unlike the agricultural conference, where ardent opinions about the food problem were expressed to the fullest, the proposals of the representatives at the materials exchange conference were somewhat dull, which may be due to the nature of the problem!</p>
<p>Follow Up Zeal with Action</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the various specialized conferences, the relevant government and civilian officials explained the various issues raised by the representatives from various regions in the three specialized conferences on the 29th, and the consultation conference came to an end. This Beijing consultation conference can be said to have closed in success.</p>
<p>According to the impressions expressed by Chairman Ogi, at this first conference after China's entry into the war, the zeal of the various economic figures was deeply felt. If this zeal can be put into action and efforts are made to establish the economy of the Greater East Asia, then the reason for holding the consultation conference will arise on its own. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun of October 5th and 6th by Yoshi.)</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, cotton sundries are divided into finished products and semi-finished products. The former refers to items such as socks, towels, undershirts, sanitary shirts, handkerchiefs, bed sheets, and blankets, while the latter refers to handkerchief blanks, bed sheet blanks, and blanket blanks, collectively referred to as cotton sundries. Except for being moved out of the Shanghai area control line, which requires permission from the Business Coordination Committee before it can be transported, there are no restrictions on movement within the city, such as for processing, manufacturing, or finishing and dyeing, so it can be transported freely. However, in the past, due to the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth and temporarily suspend movement, and various raw materials are similar to cloth, there have been incidents of detention. It is understood that the Business Coordination Committee has instructed the Cotton Products Industry Federation to separately open and explain the differences between various raw materials and cloth in order to facilitate identification and release by inspectors. It is understood that the above explanation has been drafted and approved, and distributed to the police bureaus in this city, which will instruct their subordinates to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Flour and Wheat Committee Coordinates Flour Export Allocation; Satisfactory Wheat Harvest This Year <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Zhongli, the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, and Inoue Yastada, the vice chairman, went north together for the purpose of North-South material exchange and inspection of the situation in the north. They returned from North China on National Day. In order to find out about Sun's impressions of this trip and what plans he has for flour exports from North China, the reporter visited the two gentlemen at the Silk Building on Beijing Road yesterday afternoon, where the secretary-general of the committee, Mr. , gave a brief interview as follows:</p>
<p>North China Facilities</p>
<p>Sun's impressions of this trip, as recorded in the newspapers a few days ago, are that he expressed his great admiration for the substantial progress made in various implementations in North China under the wartime system. All facilities in North China have made rapid progress in recent years. The irrigation problem is relatively serious, because the rainy season in the north is only two months a year, resulting in insufficient natural irrigation for farmers' production, which is very difficult. Fortunately, the North China authorities are actively working on well drilling in rural areas to solve the problem of farmland irrigation. The depth of each well is stipulated to be 40 to 100 feet. It is heard that tens of thousands of wells have been drilled in the four provinces and three cities, and in the future, this may solve the problem of people's food once and for all. The North China rationing mechanism is very complete, and has precise statistics. For example, the cities of Tianjin and Beijing are divided into districts for rationing, and the average distribution is very rationalized.</p>
<p>Flour Exports</p>
<p>Last year, the amount of flour exported to North China was not very large because the number of products was small. This year's wheat harvest is satisfactory, and the committee is in charge of flour and wheat unified processing and distribution, so wheat hoarding has disappeared. All factories are able to work, and production can be increased. If the purchase volume can be smooth and successful in the future, after the flour is made, in addition to supplying the needs of Central China, it will be exported to North China as much as possible, so as to make a small contribution to the food of North China.</p>
<p>City Rationing</p>
<p>Regarding the rationing matters in this city, a new organization is currently being actively organized by Chinese and Japanese operators. In the shortest possible time, it will be able to improve the handling in accordance with the committee's flour concentration and distribution plan, and under the strict supervision of the city authorities and the General Business Coordination Committee and the committee, the unified distribution will never increase due to the export to the north.</p>

<p>The First District Health Department, in order to prevent the spread of smallpox and protect the health of the people, has started preventive vaccinations simultaneously by the department and its sub-departments on the 4th of this month, and since the issuance of certificates, citizens have been enthusiastically requesting vaccinations. According to the reporter's inquiry to the Municipal Health Bureau, it has now been decided to launch a citywide vaccination campaign starting today. The Municipal Health Bureau announced to the public that starting today, they can request free vaccinations and receive certificates at the offices and clinics of the Shanghai District, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong Health Bureaus, in order to reduce the risk of citizens contracting smallpox and to promote the health of citizens.</p>

All stores or storers who have more than 300 bars of soap or one box of matches must register. Failure to do so will result in confiscation and punishment. The two districts have already announced this separately. It is understood that the registration is quite enthusiastic. If there is any evidence of smuggling the inventory out of the country, it will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e35">"Gone with the Wind" Brought to the Stage; Hard Work Theater to Perform Today <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>"Gone with the Wind" (that is, the movie and novel "Gone with the Wind") has long been popular all over the world. The news that "Gone with the Wind" will be brought to the stage has also been rumored for a year. Finally, today, it is met with the public. (The Hard Work Theater will make its debut performance at the Paris Grand Theater today)</p>
<p>Adapting "Gone with the Wind" into a drama is actually very difficult. The plot is too complicated, and the content and scenes are too large, making it difficult to manage on the stage. Another point is that the movie is too successful, and it is not easy to satisfy the audience. But now we can finally see "Gone with the Wind" on the stage, which is undoubtedly good news for drama lovers.</p>
<p>There are several points worth noting about this performance:</p>
<p>The term "hard work" is already well-known to the drama audience, but it is the first time that it has been formally formed into a theater group with strong strength and lineup to formally meet the audience. Moreover, it is a long-term charity performance (all income except for expenses will be donated to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund), which is especially worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>The playwrights, directors, and actors of "Hard Work" are all well-known figures in the drama world. This performance of "Gone with the Wind" is almost all-out, and the results are considerable.</p>
<p>Although "Gone with the Wind" is adapted from foreign movies and novels, it only takes its touching plot. The content of this script has been adapted and is completely Chinese. (The script has been published in "Vientiane" magazine) It takes the National Revolution around the 15th year of the Republic of China as the background of the times and writes about the joys and sorrows of a group of young people. These situations are all familiar to us and are naturally more intimate and interesting.</p>
<p>I hope that drama lovers will not miss this great opportunity to enjoy a good show and also a good opportunity to promote the scholarship movement. (Jin Yun)</p>

<p>The fourth game of the basketball match was held yesterday afternoon in the rain at the Paramount Ballroom. Qianghua lost to the mixed team, 62 to 54. Zhang Hua failed.

The Shantou team took the lead with 8 to 0. Tongren finally scored one point from a penalty by Xuan. Afterwards, the Shantou team became even more rampant, and the score soared. At the end of the first half, the Shantou team had an absolute advantage with 19 to 1. In the second half, Tongren counterattacked, and Liu Fushan made many contributions, but unfortunately, the points lost were too great. The Shantou team finally defeated Tongren with a score of 46 to 19. In the main event, Xu Wen of Qianghua and Wang Jinghu both scored points, while Zhuo Guorong of the mixed team returned the favor.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e47">After the Price Reassessment of Various Industries <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>In this time of wartime economic hardship, everyone is looking forward to the stabilization of prices. Therefore, the move to reassess and set price limits by the price assessment committees of various industries is welcome news to consumers. In recent days, in addition to reassessing the price limits of various commodities, industry associations have also devoted themselves to rectifying industry regulations to prevent situations of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant behavior. We feel that the last clause in the newly revised regulations of various industries: "All goods that have been assessed and have price limits, whether wholesale or retail, must be responsible for adhering to the assessed price limits and must not intentionally violate them" is especially worthy of support. Because, in recent times, the failure of prices in Shanghai to universally and thoroughly stabilize is not due to the lack of effort of the control organs, nor is it due to the lack of effort of the various levels of institutions under the control organs, but simply due to the fact that some wholesalers and retailers, especially retailers, still cannot escape the tendency to pursue illegal profits.</p>
<p>The key to the price reassessment of various industries lies in how to eliminate the bad habit of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant behavior. If it cannot be eliminated, then the reassessed price limits, no matter how reasonable they are, will only be "attempts." Price control originally relies on the cooperation of officials and civilians to achieve success, and the tools to promote success rely on dual legal and moral constraints. The various decrees of the government to stabilize prices must be enforced without any leniency. This is the constraint of national law on prices. Merchants must abandon selfish and self-interested claims, limit operating profits, and use this to benefit the population. This is the constraint of merchant morality on prices - always taking into account the interests of consumers and always thinking of the pressure that life places on the general public. In recent months, the government has exercised special powers to deal with hoarding issues, which can be said to have achieved some significant results. We earnestly hope that various industries can also exercise special powers to assist the price policy, and strive to give full play to the self-governance ability and awareness of merchants, and even report illegal behaviors themselves to warn those who violate industry regulations, and must remember and not forget the morality of merchants - always considering the interests of consumers and always thinking of the pressure of life on the general public.</p>

<p>The cotton products centralized allocation method has been finalized by the Shanghai Affairs Department of the Materials Control Review Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is expected to be implemented soon. In order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the implementation of centralized allocation of cotton products in various regions and the unified manufacturing control of cotton yarn and cloth, the Chamber of Commerce is planning to dissolve the cotton yarn and cloth purchasing office responsible for the implementation of the purchasing work. At the same time, it may set up another management department and establish cotton and cotton products divisions under it. The cotton division will be responsible for the purchase of cotton, the allocation of raw materials to factories, and all matters related to the manufacturing of cotton yarn and cloth. The cotton products division will be responsible for all matters related to the distribution of cotton products. It is expected that the newly established cotton professional division of the current Chamber of Commerce may also be dissolved in the future.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions" and the implementing rules for management policies, financial institutions (i.e., banks, pawnshops, and trust companies) have been operating normal businesses in accordance with legal procedures, thereby stabilizing finance, especially after the full recovery of the concession.</p>
<p>Financial Control</p>
<p>has been completely eradicated and no longer exists. All financial institutions in Shanghai are working hard to develop their businesses under the guidance of the Central Bank, and with the government's implementation of wartime economic policies, the adjustment of financial and industrial and commercial organizations, and the gradual promotion of the control of various major commodities, the exchange of goods between regions is smooth, and the use of funds is becoming more active. Therefore, after consolidating their own foundations and capital, they are actively expanding as appropriate.</p>
<p>Inland Business</p>
<p>branches and offices have been established in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Bengbu, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other places to engage in deposit and loan businesses. It is learned that various financial institutions, in order to assist the government in promoting construction and increasing production, are paying particular attention to industrial and</p>
<p>Agricultural Lending.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications and other banks have jointly handled wheat and silk loans. Although the Bank of Communications has made considerable progress in promoting rural loans, it has also cooperated with other commercial banks to allocate agricultural loans and has allocated a portion of funds to be re-loaned to various banks and pawnshops for rural loans.</p>
<h3 id="e50">No Conflict Between Earth Wine and Liquor Brewing Associations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The government has adjusted various industry associations in order to implement a wartime economic structure and has merged organizations with similar businesses to unify them. The liquor industry associations in this city have also been merged into the "Shanghai Special City Liquor Brewing and Sales Industry Association," which was established some time ago. However, the establishment of the Earth Wine Vendors Association seemed to conflict with the affairs of the association and was also contrary to the adjusted structure. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Food Bureau for prohibition. The Grain Bureau has now issued an explanation stating that the Earth Wine Vendors Association has adopted the basic principle of transporting earth wines from various parts of Jiangsu Province, concentrating them in this city for wholesale to various liquor stores, and then selling them to Shanghai residents for consumption, which does not conflict with the affairs of the association. However, there are differences among the members of the association regarding the items presented, and each county magistrate has been notified.</p>

<p>Rayon: Yesterday, real sales turned weak, and hoarding profits gradually began to be released, so the market trend showed a soft picture and retreated into the level.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been promoting the inspection work of various financial institutions very smoothly with excellent results. The entire financial business has been developed suddenly. Because the accounting subjects of various banks and pawnshops in this city are quite inconsistent, after investigating the names of the accounting subjects used by each bank and pawnshop, there are more than one hundred and several dozens. Each uses a different one. This situation does not conform to the system of wartime financial organization institutions, and it causes many misunderstandings and ambiguities with merchants. In order to unify the names of accounting subjects, all the different names of accounting subjects used by each bank and pawnshop have been collected for research, to meet the current needs and the ones adopted by each bank and pawnshop. It is heard that the office will convene the accounting directors of various banks and pawnshops, as well as experienced accounting experts, to study and determine the uniformity.</p>

<p>The city's industry has recently been gradually moving inland. For example, in the past, the inland areas mostly relied on this city for cooking oil. Recently, under the principle of local manufacturing, small oil factories in the inland areas have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and production has become excessive. Therefore, recently, a large amount of cooking oil has been shipped from Wuxi, Jiangbei, and other places to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>In other news, the local oil pressing factories have recently been in a state of suspension due to the lack of oil grain raw materials because the purchase of oil grains has not yet been implemented. They are resuming work.</p>

<p>Crushing Conspiracy</p>
<p>Minister Izubuchi first stated that the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a war to liberate the Asian nations. After Burma's independence, the Philippines also declared independence and officially established an independent republic. Looking back, the conspiracy of the anti-Axis powers has been completely crushed, and the meaning of the war on the mainland is exactly the same. In the past, the anti-Axis powers maliciously fabricated slander and destroyed our dignity. After our actions, the weaker countries will cooperate to complete their independence. This despicable rumor will be self-defeating. Minister Izubuchi also said that since the end of September, the Japanese army's actions in the five lakes area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been quite effective. In order to show the Japanese army's intention to attack, both directly and indirectly, it has greatly assisted the Kuomintang's military, political, and economic aspects. In this operation, the Japanese army completely occupied important areas such as Guangde in the southwest area of Taihu Lake in less than ten days. Now this war zone has been expanded, and preparations are being made for the next target. The security of the occupied area will be established by the Japanese army. The area is 15,000 to 16,000 square kilometers with a population of 3 million. This vast area and prosperous population are included in the peaceful area.</p>
<p>Living and Working in Peace</p>
<p>Minister Izubuchi said that this area was the only source of food for the Third War Zone, producing 20 million bags of rice, 5 million bags of wheat, and 1.5 million bags of beans each year. Other geological resources, such as lime, amount to 7 million tons, and coal amounts to 50 million to 60 million tons. This huge amount of production is shocking and has now been completely included in the peaceful area. It is enough to hit Chongqing hard. The area was previously occupied by the Chongqing "Loyal Patriotic Army," which threatened to conscript supplies and impose exorbitant taxes. Therefore, the people hated the "Loyal Patriotic Army" very much. Since the Japanese army's attack, they have welcomed it very much, and a large number of people have returned. The main reasons for the people's enthusiastic welcome and the rapid restoration of security are that the Japanese army has considered the local situation. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, cigarettes, and cotton cloth were very scarce in the area. After providing the necessities of life, the large amount of local production was exchanged for materials, and the people lived and worked in peace. Minister Izubuchi said that the "Loyal Patriotic Army" has been completely defeated, and the security of the area is stable. Therefore, the British and American conspiracies to disrupt the peaceful area have been crushed, and the abundant rice production in the area will allow for a rich amount of rice to be collected when the rice is purchased in the future. In addition to supplying the local area, the excess can be transferred to other areas, which will greatly benefit the peaceful area.</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima Denounces American Propaganda</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the News Department denounced the recent boring propaganda by American spokesmen. Matsushima first pointed out that the spokesman said that the recent large-scale bombing by American aircraft showed that Japan would not retaliate and that Japan's power in the Pacific had weakened. Minister Matsushima immediately asserted that, as far as he knew, the Navy was preparing for the next major war and was preparing for the next major war, waiting for the opportunity to launch an attack. The recent facts of the Japanese Navy and Air Force bombing the Indian island of Xilan show that the Japanese naval aircraft can safely cross the Indian Ocean to scout the British military base. Therefore, any malicious propaganda by the anti-Axis powers completely contradicts our people's proof of the strength of the Japanese army. Finally, he cited the late Marshal Togo's "Do not speak, implement" legacy, which is a clear saying from the Meiji era in Japan, and is especially followed by the Japanese military. Finally, he refuted the anti-Axis side for spreading rumors without actually launching a counterattack, saying that they had scouted Burma or scouted the Japanese mainland, using this boring propaganda to attempt intimidation, while Japan would never adopt this kind of despicable means.</p>
<p>Chief Hirota Discusses Agreement Between Britain and Portugal</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota, Information Chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, commented on the signing of the agreement between Britain and Portugal:</p>
<p>Forced to Conclude a Treaty</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota first pointed out that this agreement between Britain and Portugal is determined to be a coercive policy implemented by Britain against small and neutral countries. Warring countries must not use neutral territories as political bases. This time, Britain's conclusion of an agreement on the island of Azore in Portuguese territory is actually Britain using it as a political base. Although Britain has repeatedly stated that there is no act of aggression against neutral countries after signing the agreement with Portugal, it is actually trying to cover up. People do not know that it is completely an act of aggression, but whether this kind of behavior is recognized or violated by the neutral countries is because they are too oppressed and recognize it. Therefore, we cannot think that Portugal supports it in a free environment. Moreover, in a few months, Mr. Sandringham was forced to pressure the Portuguese government, and the attempt to use the Azore Islands failed. This time, Britain did not resort to pressure and issued an ultimatum to force the Portuguese government to recognize it. Who would believe that this kind of behavior is not an aggression against neutral countries? Britain's use of Azore as a political base actually invoked the treaty concluded in 1273. From this point of view, it is difficult to base the assertion of one's own position on a treaty from 600 years ago. Mr. Hirota explained the use of territory by neutral countries to warring countries in three points: 1. Permanent lease 2. Ceding territory 3. Warring parties. The Portuguese government has not implemented the above three points so far. This time, Portugal has handed over the Azores Islands to Britain for use. We assert that it is completely violating the treaty. However, looking at the position of the Portuguese government, we can recognize that it is difficult to make preparations due to temptation and to avoid difficulties. It cannot be avoided during the war, but we hope that the Portuguese government will take care of all parties and do its best.</p>
<p>Observing European Trends</p>
<p>Information Chief Hirota answered the reporter's questions, observing the recent trends in Europe. He said that although the anti-Axis forces may be able to land on the Iberian Peninsula, if they land on the French connection, they will suffer a miserable disappearance. The anti-Axis side also clearly expects that it will use Portugal and Spain to join the anti-Axis alliance to launch a possible attack on the French mainland. The defense of Germany is as solid as a rock. Therefore, any attempt by the anti-Axis powers to use the two countries of Spain and Portugal to attack will be easier for Germany to compare with the military situation at that time. The current German defense is dozens of times stronger than the situation of Napoleon. Mr. Hirota further explained the following two points: 1. In Napoleon's time, Spain was occupied by Napoleon, and his brother was on the Spanish throne. The Spanish people opposed it, but the Spanish general, Duke Wellington, was enthusiastic about protecting this side in the German war and joined the Axis line. 2. Napoleon was defeated by Imperial Russia in 1812, but the current Soviet Union's own strength is stronger than Imperial Russia, and Germany has already defeated this powerful Soviet Union and won a great victory. Therefore, the German army is dozens of times stronger than Napoleon's army. Therefore, we will take the history of Napoleon's defeat as a lesson. The current strength of the German army is strong, and it is absolutely impossible to repeat its story.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Discovery of Ancient Cannons <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Modern warfare's most effective weapons all use gunpowder. China was the first country to utilize gunpowder. During the Song Dynasty, it was already used in the military. What the Liao Dynasty called "Heaven-Shaking Thunder" was actually a type of "cannon." Later, gunpowder was introduced to Europe, where Westerners improved it and turned it into a modern weapon of war. During the reign of Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty, Westerners residing in China were ordered to manufacture cannons for defending the Shanhaiguan Pass. Even during the Qing Dynasty's campaigns against the frontier regions, these cannons were used. Unfortunately, our people clung to old methods and did not investigate further. It was not until the Westerners invaded that we realized the power of the gunpowder that our ancestors used for firecrackers.</p>
<p>Beijing was the capital of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Through repeated turmoil, many treasures were often buried underground. Recently, ancient cannons from the Ming Dynasty were discovered, which makes us reflect on the origins of this weapon and the history of our country suffering from it. The discovery of the ancient cannons was accidental. According to a newspaper report: "The Dun Microorganism Research Institute on Chang'an Street in this city was dredging a hidden ditch in its courtyard when it discovered five ancient cannons, each about three feet long and eight inches in diameter, all made of iron, believed to be relics from the Ming Dynasty. They have been sent to the History Museum for research. According to investigations, this location was once an ordnance bureau, and several ancient cannons have been discovered there in previous years. There are many ancient artifacts buried underground, hence this discovery." (New Beijing Daily, September 29th)</p>
<p>Oil Shortage and Coal Shortage</p>
<p>Over the past year, daily necessities in Beijing have experienced periodic shortages. At the end of last year, there was a soap shortage. A small piece of ordinary soap suddenly rose to more than one yuan and was still hard to find. Later, there was a fabric shortage, with a foot of blue cloth costing as much as two or three yuan. This spring, there was a food shortage, which occurred in waves and has become increasingly severe. The newspapers have suddenly reported that the authorities are planning to distribute supplies on a large scale, which seems to solve the shortage problem. However, the items allocated last time still cannot be redeemed even with coupons. How the future distribution will be is hard to be optimistic. However, the prices of kindling that had risen sharply after the city gates were closed for epidemic prevention have indeed fallen these days, marking a segment in the cycle. Some time ago, the price of soap suddenly dropped, while the raw materials for manufacturing soap became scarce and expensive. Recently, there has been an oil shortage and a coal shortage. Oil includes both fat oil and vegetable oil. People in Beijing have long stopped eating much pork. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price of meat rose from around four yuan per catty to over seven yuan, and nine out of ten shops had no meat to sell. The rise in vegetable oil prices is quite significant. Before the festival, a catty of peanut oil was 3.8 yuan, but now it's almost six yuan. It's also hard to buy from oil mills, and it's difficult to get even five catties. Coal is originally a local product of Beijing, but it has also become scarce recently. The price of coal was 2.4 yuan per hundred catties two months ago, but now it has risen to about four yuan. Soon, coal briquettes may become rare gifts. This periodic shortage clearly indicates that the reason is hoarding, otherwise, things could not suddenly appear and disappear. Does the authority have a thorough solution to this?</p>
<p>Traffic Restoration</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly prevent the plague, the Beiping authorities ordered the closure of Beijing's city gates. Only one or two gates were half-opened under strict military guard. At the same time, it was forbidden for people to take trains at Beijing stations. These measures gave some rumor-mongers an opportunity to be active, and all kinds of rumors circulated in Beijing every day. There were even extremely ridiculous rumors. In the past few days, several autumn winds have blown, and the weather has become significantly colder, so the plague's momentum has been greatly reduced. According to news reports, only seven people have contracted the plague in the past three days. Therefore, other epidemic prevention measures are no longer necessary, and the authorities have ordered the opening of the city gates from October 1st, and all trains can be taken freely.

<h3 id="e56">High Pawnshop Interest <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>The recent assessment of vegetable prices and the distribution of daily necessities has brought great excitement and comfort to the citizens. Poor people can breathe a little easier, or at least no longer feel the pressure tightening every day. The authorities' concern for the people's suffering and their direct measures for the national economy are admirable. Implementing these measures thoroughly to alleviate the people's difficulties will bring significant benefits. However, the economic exploitation of the poorest people (lack of financial flexibility) has not been reduced at all.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a poor relative came to me and said that in order to buy a peck of rice, he pawned several lined cotton clothes and got 200 yuan in banknotes. Four months ago, 200 yuan was enough to buy a peck of rice. Now, four months later, with the cold weather approaching, he has to add clothes. He took a portion of his salary to redeem them. When he calculated the redemption price, it exceeded one-fourth of his salary, turning 200 yuan into 272.8 yuan.</p>
<p>He said, "For using a peck of rice," I gave away four sheng (market price). It's not easy for the poor to live."</p>
<p>This interest of over 70 yuan is too high. I asked him how it was calculated. He said, "A 'pawn deduction' of 10% and a monthly interest of 6%. The 'pawn deduction' is equal to a 'commission' or 'handling fee' that is added to the interest at any time. So, the face value becomes 220 yuan, and the monthly interest of 6% is calculated on that total. After four months, isn't it 52.8 yuan, turning it into 272.8 yuan? But I only received 200 yuan in reality."</p>
<p>"How terrible! The rich store rice, coal, and oil in their homes by the loads. They buy at low prices, so price increases don't affect them. Common people buy in small quantities, so they suffer from price increases. They lack financial flexibility and also have to endure the exploitation of high-interest loans!" After he finished speaking, he pointed out that someone was still eating rice that cost 70 yuan a dan, and someone had one or two hundred loads of coal briquettes piled up in their house.</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>He is a dutiful professional. He received higher education. Before the war, his income allowed him to have some savings after covering his family's expenses. After the war, he spent everything he had, and his monthly expenses exceeded his income. He would not take off his long gown. He had no money to hoard goods. He had no way to become an official. He cared about his dignity and would not borrow money from others. He still considers himself fortunate that he has not suffered unemployment.</p>
<p>He is a perfect example of the hidden poor. The war destroyed the entire national economy and created countless extremely poor people, refugees, and many hidden poor. Only a very small number became suddenly rich. There is no need to deny that there are many people who wear long gowns like him and suffer from "poverty," but are unwilling to borrow money and cannot reduce their daily expenses.</p>
<p>I thought of the poorest elderly, workers, lower-level laborers, and the unemployed. Therefore, I paid more attention to pawnshops, which regulate the private economy.</p>
<p>The wise officials of the Ministry of Social Welfare have proposed establishing public pawnshops. I don't think they have noticed the inside story of pawnshops under the current circumstances of high-interest exploitation. Here, I raise my voice and ask pawnshop owners to be compassionate, not to increase the economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and to save the poor. I also hope that the gentlemen of the Ministry of Social Welfare and the municipal authorities will ban, regulate, or adjust these practices as soon as possible to relieve the people from their suffering!</p>
<h3 id="e57">Small Opinions on the New Street Names <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>The method of correcting street names this time is very satisfactory. First: whether the names of people on street signs should be eliminated or preserved, all should be replaced with the names of places. Second: different place names on a straight line should be combined. For example, Difeng Road, Maiqi Road, and Jufu Road should all be renamed Dihua Road. Danshui Road and Popsey Road should be called Nantong Road. Mashan Road and Beile Road should be called Xiangpi Road. Bielbu Road should be connected to Chongqing Road, and Beiyun Road should be connected to Chengdu Road, etc.</p>
<p>According to this principle, the following roads have no need to be separated and should be combined into one name for easy memorization: Tianzhu Church Street should be connected to Sichuan Road, and there is no need to establish Tianhe Road separately. Jixiang Street should be connected to Jiangxi Road, and there is no need to rename it Dingnan Road. Lao Beimen Street should be connected to Henan Road, and there is no need to establish Changbai Road separately. Maidiyan Road should be connected to Shandong Road, and there is no need to establish Zaozhuang Road separately. Zhangjia Muqiao Street should be merged into Fujian Road, and there is no need to rename it Yongtai Road. Xinqiao Street should be merged into Zhejiang Road, and there is no need to rename it Ziyang Road. Xi Mulaihuo Street should be connected to Guangxi Road, and there is no need to establish Guilin Road separately. Baliqiao Road should be merged into Yunnan Road, and there is no need to rename it Yongping Road. As for the very short Longmen Road, it should be merged with Dingding Road (McGauley Road). Xianyang Road (Al Road) and Qimen Road (Seymour Road), Maoming Road (Murming Road) and Guilin Road (Myers Avenue), Fumin Road (Gu Road) and Yuhu Road (Yumei Road), Nanhai Road (Fuxing Road) and Guangyuan Road (Tasderlang Road), Xinxi Road (Min Ni Yin Road) and Anhui Road (Wei Ai Road), Zhengyang Road (Tongfu Road) and Huangshan Road (Jinshifu Road), and Xiangshan Road (Notre Dame Road) are all on a straight line and should all be merged into one name.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some that I think do not need to be changed: for example, Yalu Road should not be renamed Zhujiang Road, because Yalu River has a more historical meaning. Also, Qingpu Road is not as good as the old one when changed to Tianjin Road, and Qiujiang Road changed to Qinghe Road. Changing the name of the Museum Road to Huqiu Road is not necessary either.</p>
<p>Zhili Road, which has not been renamed, seems to have too much feudal flavor and should be renamed Hebei Road. Whether Fengtian Road should be changed to Liaoning Road is also worth pondering. It seems that there is already a Jiangyin Road (Mengdelan Road) in the South City. I don't know if it is the same one. Furthermore, West Lin'an Road (Zier Road) and Jinling Road (Avenue Edward VII) are on a straight line and should also be merged. Also, there is no Lin'an Road in the entire list of street names. I don't know if the "West" in West Lin'an is a mistake. It is suspicious. (Bai Hong)</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>The road changes in the first and eighth districts have been officially announced on October 10th, which shows the municipal government's determination to take back the concessions and completely change the street names. The street signs will naturally also be changed. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to offer a few words as a citizen.</p>
<p>In the past, the house numbers in the first and eighth districts only had numbers and no street names. This was not a problem for those who knew the roads, but it was inconvenient for those who were not familiar with the routes. I hope that attention will be paid to this in addition to the road signs. It is best to install more road signs and indicate the names of the previous and following roads on each road sign.</p>
<p>In addition to the first and eighth districts, there are many places in Shanghai where road administration needs to be improved urgently. For example, in the South City, apart from the two roads of the Republic of China, there are hardly any "decent" roads. They are narrow and rugged. Some don't even look like roads. Most of the houses in the South City have been destroyed. It is appropriate to take this opportunity to delineate the boundaries of the roads, not only to widen the road surface but also to renovate them. Once the road administration has been improved and the environment has become more beautiful, the original owners of the destroyed houses will be happy to rebuild them. This is a prerequisite for the revival of the South City. Please pay attention to it. (Meng)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Eighth District Authorities to Formulate Measures for Handling Lost Children <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Chimo</p>
<p>Now that the weather has turned cooler again, children from middle and upper-class families wear the most ordinary woolen sweaters and trousers. However, the price of wool is terribly high. The "Bee Brand" is shockingly expensive, and even the ordinary brands cost more than half a thousand per pound. As a result, the gangs who live by "peeling frogs" (a slang term for those who live by illegal schemes) are very active. Moreover, in addition to "peeling frogs," they can also "pick up right heads" (kidnapping children). Under these circumstances, there are incidents of children getting lost everywhere. The Third Police Bureau has recently formulated measures for handling lost children, which are transcribed below:</p>
<p>When on-duty detectives and neighborhood officers discover lost or abandoned children, they should immediately send them to the police sub-bureau in their jurisdiction. The sub-bureau will send personnel to investigate the child's parents or guardians, order them to find a guarantor to claim the child, and report it to the bureau and notify the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office for reference.</p>
<p>If the parents or guardians of the aforementioned lost or abandoned children come to the bureau to claim them, the bureau's responsible personnel should handle the matter in accordance with the regulations and must not deliberately make things difficult.</p>
<p>If the parents or guardians of the lost or abandoned children cannot be found, the child should be brought to the Identification Section of the Judiciary Department of this bureau to have their photo taken (children under two years old are exempt from being photographed). Then, the child should be sent to Guangci Hospital for care. At the same time, the photo should be attached to a report to the bureau, and a copy of the report, along with a photo, should be sent to the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office.</p>
<p>The Children's Protection Section will send personnel to conduct a detailed investigation of the child's parents or guardians based on the above report copy, order them to find a guarantor to claim the child, and notify the Correction Section of this bureau of the handling situation.</p>
<p>If the parents or guardians of the lost or abandoned children who have been sent to Guangci Hospital for care wish to claim them, they can go directly to the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office to find a guarantor to claim them.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Review of the Method of Eating Ginkgo Soaked in Vegetable Oil <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Shen Bao published an article by Mr. Jiang Yilan on June 23 discussing the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, which mentioned that fresh young ginkgo with green skin soaked in vegetable oil for 100 days, then take out two at a time, and take them together with the skin and kernel, has a great effect. I don't know which layer of skin Mr. Lan is referring to when he says "skin and kernel." Fresh ginkgo looks like a plum. The outermost layer is a thick, juicy pericarp, which is usually not eaten. Inside is a hard shell, which is the common ginkgo. There is still a membrane inside, and the kernel is inside the membrane. I have asked someone to buy it, and it will be 100 days soon, but I don't know the truth and dare not eat it, for fear of danger. I hope Mr. Jiang will explain it further. (Tan Yongfen)</p>
