<h3>社評　日德義協定紀念　不單獨對英美媾如</h3>
<p>兩年前的今天，德義兩國步日本之後，對美宣戰，同時，日德義軸心又簽訂了對英美不單獨媾和協定。這個協定的精神與範圍，包含着　確立三國對英美共同作戰之信念；　三國間單獨決不媾和；　建設世界新秩序。</p>
<p>在兩年的過程之中，日德義三國各自努力於所負的使命，近年秋間，雖有義大利巴特里奧內閣的叛變，可是，不久義大國，亦然與日德保持軸心關係。</p>
<p>英美素來以狡獪著稱，他們的政治攻勢，不惜威脅利誘，欺騙硬嚇，誠是無孔不入。所以，軸心國的不單獨媾和協定，無寗說是針對英美的狡猾，明示決心，愼防　誘。我們從義大利巴特里奧政權的被誘叛離，及其今天的狼狽出境，更足以證明英美繳獲伎倆之毒辣，以及義國一部份人的信念遊移，致食今日獲滅之果。</p>
<p>今天雖則是日德義三國的盟約紀念之日，然而這一盟約正啟示了我們：凡目標正確，前途明朗的盟約，必須堅定信念，威武不屈，切實履行，如果意志游移，必致自食覆敗之果。從而我們大東亞各國之間，對於盟約，對於宣言，必須各自忠實履行，以完成盟約宣言中所期侍的使命，以達到所要求的目標。這是我們對於盟邦日本與德義兩國，訂立對英美不單獨媾和感協者。二周年之日，同伸紀念之餘，兼示所感者。</p>
<h3>呈獻金屬</h3>
<p>從本月八日起，本市開始收集購買廢金屬運動，第一期目標，鐵類三萬公噸，銅類五百公噸。以及其他非鐵金屬。由中日雙方各組織令屬收回委員會進行其事。實施辦法，詳載本月七日各報。</p>
<p>金屬物資在戰時軍需物資中最佔重耍地位，已為大家所普遍認識，換句話說，維持軍需物資的供給，爭取戰爭的勝利，就必須源源取得金屬物資。所以，金屬物資是與戰爭勝利具有密切關係的。</p>
<p>我們對敵作戰，是不是要爭取勝利？當然是絕對要爭取勝利。如果我們戰爭失敗了，國家覆了，我們保留者金屬物資滅還有何用？所以，我我們敬告全市民衆，尤其是中產以上的，大家瞑目的靜思一下，必須首先明白當局所以收集金屬的意義，自動地把保存的金屬物資呈獻出來，好在政府也可給以相當代價。與其留在家裹毫無用處，不如是獻國家當作大大的用途。我們可以從這一次的收回金屬運動裏，可以看出國民的愛國及協力大東亞戰爭的程度怎樣？</p>
<p>我們的同胞有一種傳統習慣，就是愛惜自己的物力，愛惜物力原是美德，不過，只愛惜自己的物力是白私，而無條件的一味愛惜却又是吝　。我們必須打破這一傳統習慣，在公利急於私利時，就絕不愛惜的貢獻出來。放然，我們同時希望你給辦理收集十五的諸君，也許認　同胞的習慣，不辭用舌敝脣焦去說服，而避免懾服，因為人民眞正的愛國心，正可以從此等處培　滋長呢！</p>

<h3>松村報到部長　論目前戰局　大東亞民衆一致舊起</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大水營陸軍報道部長松村透逸大，十日上午十時半於在鄉將校團總會以「寄鄕軍」為題，發表　演，就目前戰局論　頗詳，茲誌其要旨如次：於此戰爭進入第三年之時·願一述戰局之現况及對未來作一展望　自</p>
<p>去年夏季　以來·敵軍已開始總反攻，其中最激烈者，為麥克沃　指揮之所羅門，新幾內亞戰綫，綜合其間敵軍之陸海空各方面損失，巳近廿萬，總之，南太平洋及蒙特巴頓為東南亞洲軍總司令，迄今雖不斷宣傳反攻，然仍無動作，哈爾塞與尼米資亦一面忍受痛苦，一面孤軍掙扎。再視渝方，渝方為呼應英國之反攻緬甸，乃曾放心渡過怒扛，此亦因日軍之制先攻擊而大敗，繼此由於常德附近一役，其第六戰區，亦瀕潰滅，第六區司令陳　為呼應反攻緬甸，曾以雲南遠征軍司令官遠去昆明結果亦不得不辭職，急速反囘第六戰區。此間英軍固未一動，其所行者，仍不外犧牲渝方與美國而巳，蓋是役敵方陣亡總數之中，僅渝軍即佔有百分之四十五，其次為印軍，而英軍則僅估百分之五·此固</p>
<p>狡猾英人　之本色業。於此第三年作戰我人必須予敵軍以百萬之損害，使敵軍深悟戰爭究非如兒戲之寫意。又彼等曾於上月末在</p>
<p>開羅商討　封太平萍作戰之策，宣傳使日本無條件投降，並佔領我領土，使降為三等國種種狂言，然敵等於太平洋作戰，巳損失將兵四十萬，沉失戰艦十一艘，航空母艙二十七艘及其他大小艦船四百餘艘，被擊落飛機八千餘架，敵自去夏展開反攻後，迄今不過僅進抵新幾內亞，所羅門，吉爾貝特之一隅。敵方既為商討太平洋作戰計劃，而麥克沃塞及尼米資等竟未往參加，其空洞可知。故所謂使日本無條件投降一事，實不過痴人說夢，使日本降為三等國等語、亦誠屬　語，故開羅公報不過為侵略者之瘋狂夢話。顧又彼等因　大東亞宣言崇高宏遠之聲勢，乃用盡奸發，以拉攏渝方為其爪牙，且時以渝方洪其犧牲，使大東亞各民族分離，但其此種謀略已屬陳腐，蓋亞洲民族乃世界中最深知英美本性者，對於英美侵略之眞相，巳有曹富之體騐，英國於</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭　一役，其居心巳昭然若揭，當時首相葛拉斯頓亦謂：英國藉不顧人這戰爭，在亞洲沿岸懸掛英國國旗，實不能正視，又美國曾藉口人道，於美西戰爭中有何作為乎，當美西戰爭發生時，誠實之菲律賓人。被美國所騙，信美國眞將於戰后使菲島從西辦呀極　重獲得解放，故組織菲律賓軍與西班牙軍而戰，對於美軍之勝利頗多貢獻，但美國同睹其得獲勝利以後，乃竟拒絕菲軍開入馬尾刺巿，結果美菲西軍發生衝突，進而釀成美菲戰爭，兩年之久，是役菲律濱軍受損慘重。</p>
<p>菲島居民　被美軍殺戰者、為數尤夥，常時呂宋人口約有三百五十萬人，其中被殺口達六卞萬，全佔人者六分之一，其餘之六分之五，聞因美軍兵力不足之故，否則將全被殺我，美將貝爾將此　爭虐待事，實美將具爾將此猶殺謂「美軍强加菲島人民之常識」，聞其此種報吿係於聖誕節之夜發行，可謂殘忍巳極，故大東亞各國家各民族當日本將英美驅出亞洲之時，乃羣歡呼，一致奮起，大東亞十億民族，巳於堅固團結下，為完成大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞努力奪門，大東亞主民族，已洞悉英美之侵略，熟知彼等欲使大東亞民旅　入彼等之欺瞞輿欺　術中，吾人既知獨立之光榮，奴隸之屈辱，故應為</p>
<p>亞洲獨立　而奪門，兩年前我日本對英。美宣戰，吾人警犧牲一切，於御威必之之，信爭取德利國，戰關術於此彬洛則茲曾謂，所謀必騰難之，信念不甚　生決動，　也過。困難，亦決不發生動搖也。</p>
<h3>若彬氏病逝</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本前駐美特命全權公使若杉氏，九日晚十一時半因病逝世，享年六十一歲。按若杉氏於明治三十九年由東亞同文書院畢業後，即入外務省服務，昭和五年任駐舊金山總領事，其後復曾歷任駐華大使館參事官及上海總領事，昭和十六年一月，野村大使開始日，美交涉後，被任命為駐美特命全權公使。</p>
<h3>與亞幹部會議　昨繼績舉行　懇談中決定五項要點</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據福岡電話：中，日·滿興亞團體幹部會議，九日在福崗市博外飯店揭幕，十日上午九時繼續舉行，九日會議席上曾決定三國國民巳對大東亞共同宜言表明　護熱誠·為實錢大東亞共同宣言起見，實有加强三國國民組織，發動偉大民族遝動之必要。十日會議席上，復就具體問題表明大東亞民族之熱情，繼績通行懇談，結果決議下列幾點：　與亞運動今後之方針，係根據大東亞共同宣言，以謀其具體化。　就宜言之五項原則作一決定，其具體實踐方針，各圑體協力展開強力之運動。　當展開運動之時，樹立適應各國特殊性之力策、實為必要。　該會為使各國行動務須一致，以此際成立某項組織，加强各團體之連繫，確立組織，結集體制，實為必要。　於確立立總力團結體制之同時，整備國內運動體制，實爲必要，尤以青少年運動為各運動之推進力，實有整備綜合體制之必要等，正午稍事休息後，復於下午繼績會議，迄五時始散。</p>
<h3>三國締盟二周年德駐日大使聲明</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　德駐日大使斯塔瑪以十一日為日德義軍事同盟締結二週年紀念日，特於十日發表聲明，大意謂？英美於深知日德兩聞作戰之精神鞏固之餘乃迭次利用幼稚之宣傳工作，向同盟圑間散佈謠言，並謀擾亂戰時後方戰綫，但此機妄動巳　失敗。今吾人巳把握勝利之主要條件，為呼　前綫將士實鬥，　人除一新其共同之誓約外，應盡一切力量爭取最筏勝利。</p>
<h3>緬邊阿拉地區展開熾烈遭遇戰　反軸心承認日防衛堅固</h3>
<p>斯丹埠卞日中央社電　英國自開羅會談後，卽宣傳蒙特巴頓軍將進攻緬甸，並準備以駐印空軍對緬甸施以轟炸，然由日軍機隊五日事先轟炸加爾各答市觀之，足證敵毫無機乘。同時日軍並於陸上積極展開警戒活動，阿拉坎地區，日軍偵察隊每日與反軸心軍反覆展開熾烈之遭適戰，緬甸北部國境，日軍對防衛拉多公路之渝軍，亦加以重壓，是日軍之防衛極為堅因。據新德里電稱：東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部，曾於八日發表公報，承認以上之事實，略謂：　阿拉坎地區，於過去一週內，反軸心軍與日軍偵察隊，曾展開熾烈之白　戰。　緬甸北部日軍，曾對防衛拉多公路之渝軍加以攻擊，其陣地巳强化。</p>

<h3>中儲券發行總額距離和點尙遠　陳財闡釋目前通貨問題</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國府財政部次長陳之碩氏，於日昨接見記者，對目前通貨問題，有所闡釋，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>（問）目前中儲券流通狀况如何？（答）中儲當局對於發行一向愼重，隨時在求適合環境之應付對策，於銀根之緊弛·數量之盈虛，尤為注意。務使通貨流通額，滴合於國家經濟及社會金融。現中儲券發行總額，及目前通貨需要及經濟情形，距飽和點尙遠。</p>
<p>（問）物價高漲與通貨問題，有密切關係·請問就通貨問題上看，對於物價之對策如何？（答）貨物價值因與通貨問題有關，但物價之高漲，在戰時狀態之下，其重大原因即在運輸難於暢旺，供求不能相應，其結果遂演成物資映乏，物價騰貴之現象。故增加生產，流暢運輸，實為當前急務。</p>
<p>（問）吸收遊資之具體實施步驟如何？八答）關於吸收游資，如獎勵儲蓄，限制囤積等等，巳有種種辦法，業於京滬各報隨時披露，嗣後當益趨具體化，以求調節。</p>
<h3>日駐華派遣軍　發表周問戰況　擊落飛機達十九架</h3>

<h3>周市長岸部長　演講詞大要</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　首都中日民衆共同戰爭大會席上，周市長（陸秘書長代）及岸悄報部長演講詞，大要如下：</p>
<p>周巿長代表陸秘書長致開會詞，對兩年來友邦將士的勞力作戰，將英美勢力完全逐出束亞，我們實應表示成謝。我們展望大東亞戰爭的勝利，巳很有把握。中日兩國民衆，返應緊密合作，棺互提携，使大東亞戰爭更得順利進行，使大東亞之建設，亦得以早日完隊。</p>
<p>岸情報部長講演詞，略謂在大東亞戰爭，就是全束亞的民族，來與侵略者的英美民族决鬥。大東亞戰爭開始以來，日木述戰連勝，終使英美勢力，退出東亞，由東亞民族聯合建設新束亞的意義，也一天天明瞭。中國與日本巳由同甘共苦的精神，進而為同生共死之關係，結成·一體的行動，來謀取東亞的解放。最近在東京舉行的大東亞會議，集六國領袖於一堂，百年來侵略東亞的英美勢力，從此要被消滅了，兩年以來，以太平洋上海軍所獲之戰果而言，計擊毀敵戰艦卅一　，航空母艦廿九艘，巡洋艘一五〇艘，飛機達七千架，戰死兵士大槪在四十萬以上，像這種互大的打擊，就因為他們有着過多的人力和資源的緣故，送來的多，因此我們所獲的戰果，也愈大。在目前的時局進展中，大家要抱着大東亞戰爭必勝之信念云云。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭　與中國之責任　周財長撰文發表意見</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國府財政部長周佛海氏，應此間大陸新報之請，特於大東亞戰爭二週年紀念，撰「大東亞戰爭與中國之責務」一文，茲譯錄大意如次：</p>
<p>自盟邦日本發動大東亞戰爭以來，巳屆二週年，在此兩年中，日本陸海空軍戰無不勝，攻無不克，一掃英美百年來在東亞培植之侵略勢力，彼等在東亞侵略之緬甸，菲律賓，馬來等，巳全部喪失，東亞各國家民族，於此得完成獨立自主，而大東亞繁榮基礎，亦因而確立，惟欲謀戰爭之最後勝利，東亞各國家各民族，應盡人力物力之所能，全面協力，以期早日完成共同之目的，上月舉行之大東亞會議，即為强化團結之具體表現，亦可謂為東亞民族共同保衛東亞、建設東亞之總發動機，</p>
<p>囘憶二年前，日本發　大東亞戰爭後，國民政府當即聲明與日本同甘共苦，至今年一月，並進而參戰，以同生共死之決心，與友邦日本協力。中國既為東亞之一員，常然必須傾其全力，按我國曾數度發動民族的革命運動。遠者勿論，近若國父孫先生所領導之革命運動，其目的即在求中國之自由平等，中國之所以不能完成自由平等，即因帝國主義者操縱其問，是故中國不欲完成革命則巳，苟欲圖完成革命·必須驅除英美帝國主義之侵略勢力。</p>
<p>中國現對大東亞戰爭尙無直接協則之力量，但對於增加生產，確立治安，決作最大之努力。中國處於後方地位，後方安定，即可以免除前方將士之憂，生產增加，遝輸順利，即可以助長前方進攻之力。二年來，盟邦日本軍政當局之豐功偉績，實堪欽佩，國府自盡自力之所及，從事於確立治安，增加生產工作，中國現對大東亞戰爭所能致力之處，亦即在此，吾人對建設束亞共榮圈，決心依據中日同盟條約之精神，及大束亞宣言之綱領·盡其最大之努力。</p>
<h3>三屆東亞醫學會　明春在京舉行　宮川氏普京聯絡一切</h3>
<p>南十十日中央社電　第三屆東亞醫學會大會，巳決定明春舉行。該醫學會為東亞共榮圈內一國際醫學團體·大東亞各國均將派代表參加，其意義甚為重大，故各國政府對此頗為重視。會期巳定為明年四月二十五日至二十七日三日。第一日大會在南京舉行，第二三日之學　　演則在上海舉行。講演分特別與普題兩種，除特別講演者由會方聘請外，其普通講演歡迎各地學者踴躍參加，報名地點及演講肌目內容等，須於明年一月底以前，寄至北京大學醫學院鮑艦淸院長處，以便　集。預期明春會期，必有一番盛情况。</p>

<h3>浙東與首都記著　舉行座談會</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　首都新聞記者公會，於十日下午三時，假中日文化協會，邀請浙東新聞記者京滬觀光團一行舉行座談會。由該會常務理監事等多人主持，並邀宣傳部　司長，史　辦，市宣傳處周處長等，出席指導。席間各人對如何加强總力參戰下，宣傳戰之效力如回促進，新開界本身之健全，曁相互保持緊密連繫等問題，發揮意見甚詳、全塲空氣融洽，情緒熱烈迄今至五時餘始畢。該　一行隨即應日軍報到大東亞招待，赴該部參觀大東亞合議影片。當晚並應京市新聞聯合會之宴。</p>

<h3>駐義德使格</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社訊：德元首希特勒依據外長里資特羅　之提議，將駐義德使賴恩升格為大使。</p>
<h3>應付未來戰局　德有備無患　東西夾攻歐陸絕非易事</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　據海通社訊：軍事訪員塞托留斯稱：德黑蘭公報巳明白提及集中進攻德國或歐洲，英美對蘇聯　巳接受約束，不似以前之徒託空言矣。雖進攻日期並未決定，蘇聯可能注重英美於西綫進行冬季攻勢，以配合蘇軍在東綫之進攻。但時間　促，英美參謀部並無準備，目前不列　羣島大約有步兵與坦克車隊及空軍五十師，但船舶頗感缺乏，反軸心國倘以轟炸德國國防工業·破壞歐洲交通機構，掠奪德國內綫作戰之便利，為進攻西歐之先決條件，則進攻西歐斷難成為事實。而英美消息靈通人士，亦指空襲不能發生此項影響。然蘇聯之政治壓力或勝過軍事之一律，而催促英美在西歐有所行動，藉以響應蘇軍之冬季攻勢，時局之發展，自難預言。而蘇聯之態度可視為未來發展之　象，蘇軍倘不能於今年發動冬季攻勢，即可證明英美因時間忽促，德黑蘭商定進攻歐陸之計劃，須於明春實行矣。就軍事而言，反軸心軍進攻歐陸，將着重東西兩綫，而南綫處於次要地位，但南線亦不可忽視，因反軸心軍巳在義國作戰，增援亦甚便利也。預備隊問題牽涉船舶問題，而英美運　船必須服務於歐洲與太平洋兩面，太平洋方面最近需要船舶愈益增加，不僅由於美軍遭受重創，且英美加緊對日作戰，藉以保持其威望。反軸心軍進攻南歐，或將由巴爾幹等處，而不由義國進攻，而英軍因愛琴海各島之失守，巳喪失進攻薩隆尼加區域之跳板。</p>
<h3>日德獲得時間因素充實戰力互相呼應</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德國新聞社軍事評論家　倫斯拉班，評論開羅會議及德黑蘭會議稱：反軸心方面之軍事局勢，巳顯示動蕩不定之形象，此足表示在戰綫之後方，正醞釀重大之事變。反軸心陣營對將來發展之游疑不決，此可於其參謀部之調度見之，而其主因，實緣於德·日兩國均保持充足之後備兵力，故反軸心國推斷德軍在蘇軍獲有進展及英·美恐怖空龔之後，已被推上接近決定之通　者買有廖誤，更有以為日本因交益綫之遼遠，若能使用大量海空軍以攻擊之，期極易推毀之者，此種見解，更覺荒謬。平衝過去數月之軍事局勢，德·日兩國雖曾放棄若千前所征服之領土，但彼等均對目前之戰事，幷不過予重視，僅集中其力量及精力，以增加力量，以訓練新軍。德·日兩國所獲之時間因素，係非常重要，將證明對於敵方有嚴重之影響，現指出一般戰事局勢，巳足體騐德黑蘭會議及開羅會議所討論之主題，英。美。蘇前巳蒙受重大之損失，且將作軍事上之更大犧牲焉，現德人井不如敵人所料之在一九四三年被擊潰，且絲毫不受視害，日軍亦獲得海戰防禦勢態之成功，而美人巳慘遭大敗矣。敵人所表示之全球戰略，巳證明僅為宣傳性質，而德。日兩國有共同利益之關係，故能完全調和，敵人之目標各異，故共戰略，必比軸心爲　弱無效也。日·德兩國在後方集中其戰鬥之精力，此非敵人所能阻撓者，故德黑蘭與開羅之兩次會議之主要動機，顯係體騐到軍事措置之無效而巳，勝利者，不必頻頻集會，依此角度而觀，於第二戰綫之建立，祇為一種企圖，因德軍抵抗力量之特別學强，故以第二戰綫為宣傳，以圖建立心理上之鉗形，而非軍事上之鉗形也。但軍事上之成功，方足以決定此次戰爭，而事實上重要之軍事事變，正在準備之中，以德人之見地觀之，敵人將自束西幷進，而德軍於一九四三年之節省人力物力，實依一定之計劃而施行者，敵　之欲獲悉此項之內容計劃，乃開羅及德黑蘭兩次會議之焦點，敵人正欲找尋新跳板，以為前進之階石，但德軍早有準備矣。德軍領袖，信賴自己之軍事力量·靜候事態之發展，德軍之反動，實使敵人神經焦燥，比之敵人所影響於德方者猶甚，德國之力量，將使英人發出戰事能延遲多久之疑問矣。</p>
<h3>大東亞航空聯盟在日開緊急大會　計劃增加航空戰力</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電大東亞民族航空增强聯盟，為充實强化航空戰力，特於十日午十一時假此問帝國飯店，召開十億空戰緊急總進軍全體大會，主辦者方面，到有小童原委員長，竹下海軍大將，美刈陸軍大將，中島飛機工廠廠長等四十餘名及中國蔡大使，滿洲國王大使，緬甸戴門大使，自由印度臨時政府最高顧問比哈利鮑斯多人。首由小童原委員長，水野副委員長分別致詞，繼由副委員長發表四項計劃：　增强製造飛機工人運動。　增產飛機資材運動。　國民學校滑空機運動。　全國飛機工廠之家庭化生活運動。最後由滿洲王大使致祝辭，日軍需省遠藤總局長官講演，至正午始散會。</p>
<h3>戈美爾北蘇軍　發動新攻勢　聶伯河套德防綫縮短</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　據海通社訊：東綫中路戰况沉寂已有一週·蘇軍又在普利特與貝西那河之間發動攻勢·擬向北襲取羅迦契夫（Rogachev）莫奇利夫（Mogilev）區德軍陣綫之側面，同時在許洛平（Zhlobin）區亦有蘇軍集中，恐亦有進攻模樣，但在前日蘇軍尙無若何進展。德軍在齊托密爾與科洛斯頓之間進攻·續有進展。聶伯河區激戰中心，仍在克里曼卓格西南，敵猛政鐵路交叉點史那曼卡·未能奪得之。在史那曼卡之西北，蘇軍略有推進，已與自　爾　賽前進之部隊取得接觸，惟仍未能包圍德軍之主力。德軍陣綫，則巳　　並增强不少、聶伯河奮之西，蘇軍在濃霧之中猛攻未逞，克里米亞局勢未有變更</p>
<p>東綫酷寒降雪坦克作戰困難</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德軍常局九日發表：東綫各主要戰區因巳入冬季，天　惡劣，故戰鬥均漸形緩弛，機械化部隊之作戰亦漸感困難。北部戰綫全部及中部戰綫多數地區均已降雪，夜間雖道路凝凍，亦不適於大規模作戰。尼維爾區之蘇軍因由陸路補給困難·故實行空中補給，然亦常受霧雪之阻碍。南部戰綫之北部亦薄有積雪，基輔區已漸化泥濘，大聶伯河套平均　溫為攝氏表零下六度。蘇軍八日於克里曼卓格及史那曼卡區利用濃霧增强兵力。基輔西方德軍八日又有若干進展。</p>
<h3>土耳其外長稱　外交政策不變</h3>
<p>安加拉十日中央社電　土外長曼奈門卓格魯九日接見反軸心及中立國方面記者團，發表英美土在開羅會談之經過。渠稱英土兩國間之同盟條約，經此次會談益臻强化，同時美蘇兩國與土政府間之關係，亦與英土兩國問之關係同，愈加密切。席間記者團會提出質問，謂此次會談之結果，土耳其是否距參戰巳更近一步。土外長答稱，土政府之外交政策無何變更。</p>
<p>期丹埠十日中央社電　土耳其總統伊斯美自於開羅返國後，土政界頓現異常緊張，七日曾召開臨時閣議，聽取關於開羅會談之報告。又人民共和黨議員亦將於十四日召開秘密會，由曼奈門卓格魯外長報告經過·俾承認土代表於開羅會談中所採取之政策。</p>
<h3>通羅馬公路上　德梯行陣強固卡　米諾山區德軍侯撤</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期三日義大利南部之戰事，證實並補充過去數日重大爭奪戰之發　。德軍之抵抗與反攻，巳推翻蒙高茂萊將軍與克拉克將軍之預算，英美俘虜承認彼等須對付山上與山谷中整個之防　系，而非如彼等所得之德軍防綫。敵最近沿通往羅馬之公路略有進展，但此種短距離之進展，殊不值一提。德軍深梯形陣地之防禦力，使敵此種小進展之重要性化為烏有。卡米諾山區情形頗為平靜，該區德軍地，在完成其目標後，已於星期三日后撤。</p>
<h3>決定性大戰　尙末來臨　美陸章宣稱</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　據海通社訊華盛頓息，美陸長史汀生宣稱：英美軍在北非·西西里·與南義之戰事，僅為「外圍戰」而巳，海陸決定性之大戰，尙未來臨，直至在歐陸與大量之德軍激戰時，或吾人之海軍擊破日本强有力之國內艦隊時，戰事始達決定性之階段，即距結束之時期不遠矣。</p>

<h3>柏林女性的　總力戰態勢　空襲後秩序迅速恢復</h3>
<p>從十一月二十二日到二十六日止·柏林接連四天遭受轟炸。這五日間的空　，二十四·五的兩夜，敵人還不過是　察示威，實際的轟炸，則以二是二·二十三·二十六的三夜爲主，尤以最初二晚爲甚。二十三日夜，朝日新聞社柏林分社亦卒被燒燬，分社職員也和一般柏林市民及僑船者隨身衣服會忙逃出街頭。至二是屋日，幸能設法得臨時宿舍。二十六日以後，不聞警報，至二十九日的今天，想起「柏林戰場」一周間的狀況，心也安定了。二十二日，是小雨混濛的黑夜，德軍的空防活動，頗為不利。二是三日亦是黑夜，柏林市街上餘　未盡，市內各地的火光，適爲敵人轟炸的好目標·因此，敵人的　彈相當正確，且德軍的空防活動，也因被阻於黑夜而不能發揮威力。這兩夜來　的機數計三百五十和五百五十、擊落飛機每天各二十九架，這在德軍空防上要算是成績不良。二十六日，天氣晴期，德軍空防的活動極活潑，因而敵人也不像前日那樣自由轟炸。最初二夜投下的炸彈量，據說超過為燬滅漢堡而一週間投下的炸彈量的三分之二。</p>
<p>二十四日晨的柏林，電要交通機關不能不部分的停止，街上隨地可見燒燬的電車汽車的殘骸。各建築物在噴着烟，市民們　箱荷擔，競相避難。但當局的非常對策很妥善，市民也有充分準備，故避難，恢復極見迅速，老年，幼年先已避難，故現在所剩的大多數柏林市民，都是行動活潑的人。</p>
<p>靑年性活躍</p>
<p>其中最注目的是靑年女性的活躍。靑年男子殆全部出動至前綫，靑年女子承繼共後，而很能幹地盡其職責，誠堪敬服。因二日間的大轟炸，使柏林面貌為之一變，由於當局之週到的對策及市民之自主的協力，在餘燼未盡的中問，就已迅速地踏上復興之途。其迅速實為有組織的國如納粹德國之報微，而不能不令人讚歎。一週以後的今日，交通，通信及其他，大概均巳恢復舊歡，大破壞中已見到安定的情况。</p>
<p>今次的空襲，敵方的目的本欲沮喪柏林市民以至於全體國民的士氣，但完全失敗。因敵方的不人這，使國民的抗戰意識愈如昻奮。德國政府當局對於此次轟炸時柏林巿民所表示的自主的精神，和旺盛的戰鬥精神，頗表滿意。二十四日，從旅行而歸的日本駐德大島大使，立在被破壞的大使館之前，感慨地說：「「這就是國家總力戰的狀况。」的確，今日的柏林的狀况，描出了深刻的國家總力戰的狀况。柏林市民此次突破最大的試鍊，使敵方的期待全歸落空。最近德國各報誓欲對英報復，並稱讚柏林市民的毅然態度。（翔：譯自十二月一日西部朝日新開）</p>

<h3>計口授糧制度</h3>
<p>曾燃料問題，其與燃料問題同樣嚴重而猶有過之者，則為今後之食耀問題，因為滬巿自有計口授糧以來，從未有如最近兩個月來的入於「絕糧」狀態，因為戶口米的配給，巳至名存而實亡了！</p>
<p>可是，我們對於調巿糧食的前途，是不應當過分悲歡的，因為米統會的責任與能力所在，對於食米的來源必有辦法，而自日昨第一區公署主任秘書與新任本市糧食局局長的兩段談話中，我們相信計口授糧制度的前途，斷不至長此黑暗下去，因為計口授糧制度之為成功抑為失敗，完全要看食米配給方面的兩個焦點能否解決，其一為配給能否夠量，共次為配給能否　期；不能夠　與不能　期。同為戶口米發生恐慌之最大因素，亦同為黑巿米價高漲之最大因素，換句話說，就是整個人民生活不能安定之最大原因。依照第一區公署主任秘書所說的，則『區公署當局即傾全力對各項主要物品實施計口配給，俾使本市市况　於正常，同時在經濟方面，則努力從事行使計口授糧制度，力求配給數量之增加。」又依照新任糧食局長所說的，則「滬市糧食，務使在改善民生目的下，從事工作；巿民所關心之戶口米，務使能準時配給，不使脫期。」我們但願以上兩個願望，能夠同時實現，否則計口授糧制度，將等於『畫餅充飢」而巳</p>

<h3>三國軍事協定紀念　廣田部長談話　闡明完遂作戰決心</h3>
<p>中央社訊十二月十一日，為日德義三國締結軍事協定二週年紀念日，日大使館廣田情報部長，昨日特發表談話，閘明日本完遂戰爭之決心。</p>
<p>共同昨戰</p>
<p>廣田部長談：十一日為三國軍事協定締結二周年紀念口，囘湖三國同盟，係於一九四〇年九月廿七日締結·迨至一九國一年十二月八日、日本對英美宣戰，當時德國　英國處於戰爭狀態，放亦對美國　戰·因是日德國　·關於對共同敵人英美共同　戰，再締結協定，在三國同盟上，約定日德兩國買於世界新秩序之建設。在政治·經濟·軍事上互相挼助，後於迫加協定上，更使三同盟條約趨於日體化，　以夏單獨媾和，以及兩國在戰後、亦將協力建　新秩序。</p>
<p>日軍優勢</p>
<p>敵方今日法次企圖友攻，無論歐洲戰綫或東亞戰綫，莫不如是，惟在大東亞方面、南太平洋，波根維爾島，吉爾貝特羣島，馬紹爾羣島等地，敵方慘遭大敗，在緬　　囘作戰上，亦經日軍出擊雲南，空襲加爾各答等，處處出日軍佔得優勢，又在歐洲戰綫，德國之　洲要塞日見完固，在東部戰綫·因戰略關係，自動撤退。但視在蘇聯幾巳停止進擊，而德國反在基　一帶探取攻勢，又義大利戰綫，英美軍亦無採取攻勢之實力。</p>
<p>政治攻勢</p>
<p>因此彼英美繼開羅脅談之後又有德黑　會談，企圖採取政治攻勢，彼等不斷會請，如莫斯科，魁北克，華盛頓，卡薩布蘭卡等會請是也。然每次會議結果，不過顯示反軸心國家間之裂痕，　露彼等之處張聲勢，反之日德軸心諸國，感不到有會議之必要，蓋日德兩國地理上，處於隔絕之地位，但同盟條約及軍事協定上所約定在政治經濟軍事上的密切協力，互相援助，已充分實踐。</p>
<p>決無妥協</p>
<p>日德兩國國民，對於作戰抱有絕對決心，不得最後勝利，決不放下武器，兩國國民，成深知兩國命運繫於一戰。顧敵人急於速戰速決，但吾人抱有應付無論如何長時期作戰之決心，此不但僅具決心而巳，並歷次以戰績表現，最後的勝利，必屬於我人，無可疑意，吾人並具有可操左券之決意，此次戰爭決無尖協媾和，　有使敵人無條件屈膝，屆時吾人決意，方告實現，同時亦為向全世界約定建設新秩序完成的一日，吾人決意與全世界國民，向建設世界新秩序巨步邁進，勇往直前。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>「眞人……去玩兒吧？」</p>
<p>眞人已經長大到時常有小朋友們前來打夥嬉玩的年紀了。</p>
<p>「哼……」</p>
<p>那時候，眞人決不是說不去的孩子。可是　說是孩子，有時也不跟着就跑，而要選擇一下對方。那時候，東京的孩子們，母親大槪都放他們一句很妙的問話：「等一會」。鹿兒島的孩子們，　沒有那種話，但眞人也決不拒絕朋友的　引。</p>
<p>二三個小朋友中間，最要好的是家離得最的逐漸　鬧起來的新住宅區，父親在市公區供戰所以家的建築，家庭的情形，一切都帶着書香氣息。和谷家的生活樣式恰巧相反，然而孩子們却很說得來。二人都直到八歲方才能上學，所以一起玩耍的期間，自然要乎很長久了。</p>
<p>「眞人，我的名字中不是取西鄕先生（按西鄕隆盛為明冶維新時代名將－譯者註）的名字嗎？……子</p>
<p>牟田口少年的名字川隆夫，就拿這來向眞人炫　。那地方是崇拜南洲翁的，所以名字上都帶上一個什麼隆，什麼盛。可是像隆夫這孩子，不配稱這名字，荏弱的，瘦小的身軀，祇有頭不相稱地特別的大，是腺病質的孩子。</p>
<p>「好名字啊！」</p>
<p>眞人的確覺得朋友的名字很好。</p>
<p>時常到隆夫家裏玩，他家裏有話匣子。他祇有一個妹子枝子。家裏收拾得很淸凈，和眞人家裏的　雜比起來，眞是一個天上，一個地下。孩子們因爲歡喜熱鬧，所以不高興等在這冷冰冰的家裏。</p>
<p>他們二人祇要不下雨，就到海濱去玩一天保山海岸，與次即海濱－定出一二町（三百六十尺）就到。帶淡紅色的白砂，蒼虬的老松，一片靑　的錦江灣之海，以及永遠地噴着烟的櫻島，展開在他們的眼前。那時候，天保山溫泉還沒有發掘，遊覧的道路也沒有築造，和島津齊彬的水軍興盛的時代，一戰也沒有兩樣。到處是　漠的砂灘，孩子們　著走走不完。海濱的木棉和瓠瓜的花盛開著，投石子，折松枝，誰也不來干涉。孩子們的對手，就是這美的大自然。說到普天下的美景，祇有瀋摩海灘的大自然。</p>

<h3>Editorial: Commemorating the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy; No Separate Peace with Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Two years ago today, Germany and Italy followed Japan's lead and declared war on the United States. Simultaneously, the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy signed an agreement not to pursue a separate peace with Britain and the United States. The spirit and scope of this agreement encompassed: establishing the belief of the three nations in fighting Britain and the United States together; the three nations would never negotiate a separate peace; and building a new world order.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Japan, Germany, and Italy have each strived to fulfill their assigned missions. Although the Italian Badoglio cabinet rebelled in the autumn of recent years, Italy soon returned to maintaining its Axis relationship with Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have always been known for their cunning. Their political offensives employ threats and inducements, deception and intimidation, leaving no avenue unexplored. Therefore, the Axis powers' agreement not to pursue a separate peace was undoubtedly aimed at countering the craftiness of Britain and the United States, clearly demonstrating their resolve to guard against enticement. We can see from the enticement and betrayal of the Italian Badoglio regime, and its current state of disarray, further proof of the maliciousness of British and American manipulative tactics, and the wavering faith of a segment of the Italian people, leading to the bitter consequences they now face.</p>
<p>Although today is the anniversary of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, this alliance reveals to us that any alliance with correct goals and a clear future must maintain firm faith, be unyielding in the face of power, and earnestly fulfill its commitments. If its will falters, it will inevitably reap the consequences of its own defeat. Therefore, among the nations of Greater East Asia, we must each faithfully fulfill our commitments to alliances and declarations, to complete the missions expected in the alliance declarations and to achieve the required goals. This is what we feel regarding our allies Japan, Germany, and Italy, who established the agreement not to pursue a separate peace with Britain and the United States. On this second anniversary, while commemorating, we also express our sentiments.</p>
<h3>Offering Metal</h3>
<p>Starting from the eighth of this month, our city began the movement to collect and purchase scrap metal. The initial target is 30,000 metric tons of iron, 500 metric tons of copper, and other non-ferrous metals. A Sino-Japanese joint metal recovery committee has been organized to carry out this task. The implementation details were published in various newspapers on the seventh of this month.</p>
<p>It is now widely recognized that metal resources occupy a crucial position among wartime military supplies. In other words, maintaining the supply of military supplies and striving for victory in the war requires a continuous flow of metal resources. Therefore, metal resources are closely related to victory in war.</p>
<p>Are we striving for victory in our war against the enemy? Of course, we absolutely must strive for victory. If we fail in the war and the nation is destroyed, what use is it to retain metal resources? Therefore, we urge all citizens, especially those in the middle class and above, to calmly consider the significance of the authorities' collection of metal, and voluntarily offer up their preserved metal resources, so that the government can provide appropriate compensation. Rather than keeping it at home where it is useless, it is better to dedicate it to the nation for a greater purpose. We can see from this metal recovery campaign the extent of the people's patriotism and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Our compatriots have a traditional habit of cherishing their own resources. Cherishing resources is originally a virtue, but only cherishing one's own resources is selfishness, and unconditionally cherishing them is stinginess. We must break this traditional habit and contribute without hesitation when public interest urgently requires it over private interest. Of course, we also hope that the gentlemen handling the collection will understand the habits of our compatriots, tirelessly use persuasion, and avoid coercion, because the people's true patriotism can be cultivated and nurtured from such situations!</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting Approves Next Year's Decisive Battle Budget; To Be Submitted for Discussion at the 14th Regular Session of the Diet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government will submit the draft of the general account budget for the Showa 19th fiscal year to the 14th regular session of the Diet. Based on the budget formulation policy for the Showa 19th fiscal year decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 7th, important matters, the general outline of the budget formulation, and the budget for promoting scientific and technological research, etc., decided by the Cabinet, the focus is on approving the expenses for new and essential policies that should be prioritized in the budget. In order to meticulously formulate the decisive battle budget, the Ministry of Finance and various ministries are conducting negotiations. As of the 10th, they have reached a final understanding with each ministry. At the regular Cabinet meeting held this afternoon, they discussed the estimated revenues and expenditures for the general account budget for the Showa 19th fiscal year. Finance Minister Kaya explained it in detail, and it was immediately decided and announced by the Information Bureau this afternoon (see separate telegram). The general account budget for the Showa 19th fiscal year decided this time estimates both revenues and expenditures at 152,430 million yuan, an increase of 52,480 million yuan compared to the initial budget of 99,950 million yuan for the general account revenues and expenditures of this fiscal year. It is also an increase of 12,190 million yuan compared to the budget amount of 140,240 million yuan for the general account expenditures of this fiscal year.

<h3>Reporting by Minister Matsumura: On the Current War Situation; Unity of the People of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Information of the Imperial Japanese Army, Matsumura Toruichi, delivered a lecture titled "Kikyo-gun" (Returning Homeland Army) at the National Association of Retired Officers at 10:30 a.m., discussing the current war situation in detail. The main points are summarized as follows: As this war enters its third year, I would like to discuss the current state of the war and offer a vision for the future. Since last summer, the enemy has begun its general counteroffensive. The most intense of these is the Solomon Islands and New Guinea front lines, commanded by MacArthur. The combined losses of the enemy's land, sea, and air forces in these areas are close to 200,000. In summary, the South Pacific and Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Command, have been constantly promoting counteroffensives, but have yet to take action. Halsey and Nimitz are also enduring pain while struggling alone. Looking at Chongqing, Chongqing, in response to Britain's counteroffensive in Burma, recklessly crossed the Nu River. This was also due to the preemptive attack and major defeat by the Japanese army. Following this, in the battle near Changde, its Sixth War Area also faced collapse. Chen Cheng, the commander of the Sixth War Area, went to Kunming as the commander of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force to respond to the counteroffensive in Burma, but had to resign and quickly return to the Sixth War Area. During this time, the British forces did not move at all, and their actions amounted to sacrificing Chongqing and the United States. It is estimated that among the total number of enemy casualties in this campaign, Chongqing's troops accounted for 45 percent, followed by Indian troops, while British troops accounted for only 5 percent. This is indeed the true nature of the cunning British. In this third year of the war, we must inflict millions of casualties on the enemy, making them deeply understand that war is not as carefree as child's play. Furthermore, they discussed a plan to blockade the Pacific at the Cairo Conference at the end of last month, and made wild statements about forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally and occupying our territory, reducing it to a third-rate country. However, in the Pacific war, the enemy has already lost 400,000 soldiers, 11 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, and over 400 other ships of various sizes. More than 8,000 aircraft have been shot down. Since the enemy launched its counteroffensive last summer, it has only advanced to a corner of New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. Since the enemy was discussing the Pacific war plan, and MacArthur and Nimitz did not participate, its emptiness is evident. Therefore, the so-called unconditional surrender of Japan is just a pipe dream, and the words "reducing Japan to a third-rate country" are truly foolish words. Therefore, the Cairo Communiqué is nothing more than the mad dream of aggressors. Moreover, because of the lofty and far-reaching momentum of the Greater East Asia Declaration, they used all sorts of tricks to win over Chongqing as their pawn, and constantly sacrificed Chongqing to separate the nations of Greater East Asia. However, this kind of conspiracy is already outdated, because the Asian nations are the ones who know the true nature of Britain and the United States best. They have a profound understanding of the true face of British and American aggression. Britain's intentions in the Opium War are already clear. Gladstone, the Prime Minister at the time, also said: Britain cannot face up to the fact that it is flying the British flag along the coast of Asia in a war that disregards humanity. What did the United States do in the Spanish-American War under the pretext of humanitarianism? When the Spanish-American War broke out, the honest Filipinos were deceived by the United States, believing that the United States would liberate the Philippines from Spain after the war. Therefore, they organized the Philippine army and fought against the Spanish army, contributing greatly to the victory of the American army. However, after the United States achieved victory, it refused to allow the Philippine army to enter Intramuros. As a result, a conflict broke out between the American and Philippine armies, leading to the Philippine-American War, which lasted for two years. The Philippine army suffered heavy losses in this war.</p>
<p>The number of Filipino residents killed by the American army was particularly large. At the time, the population of Luzon was approximately 3.5 million, of which 600,000 were killed, accounting for one-sixth of the population. The remaining five-sixths heard that the American army did not have enough troops, otherwise they would have all been killed. The American general Bell called this abuse of war "the common sense that the American army imposed on the Philippine people." It is said that this report was released on Christmas Eve, which can be described as extremely cruel. Therefore, when Japan drove Britain and the United States out of Asia, the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia cheered and rose up in unison. The billion people of Greater East Asia, united under a solid banner, are striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. The main peoples of Greater East Asia have seen through the aggression of Britain and the United States and know that they want to trap the people of Greater East Asia in their deceptions and trickery. We know the glory of independence and the humiliation of slavery, so we should fight for the independence of Asia. Two years ago, our Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. We are sacrificing everything. In the words of Minister Pinlocke of the German Army, the goals must be difficult to achieve, but the belief must not waver. Even in the face of difficulties, it must not waver.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wakasugi Passes Away</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wakasugi, former Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States, passed away due to illness at 11:30 p.m. on the 9th, at the age of 61.

<h3>Executive Meeting with Asia; Yesterday's Continued Session; Five Key Points Decided During Cordial Discussions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Fukuoka: The executive meeting of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Asia Promotion Groups opened at the Hakata Hotel in Fukuoka City on the 9th and continued on the morning of the 10th at 9 a.m. At the meeting on the 9th, it was decided that the people of the three countries had expressed their enthusiastic support for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. In order to realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, it is necessary to strengthen the organizations of the people of the three countries and launch a great national movement. At the meeting on the 10th, concrete problems were again used to express the enthusiasm of the people of Greater East Asia, and cordial discussions were continued. As a result, the following points were decided: The future direction of the Asia Movement is based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to make it concrete. A decision will be made on the five principles of the Declaration, and each organization will cooperate to launch a strong movement to implement them concretely. When launching the movement, it is necessary to establish strategies that adapt to the particularity of each country. In order for the actions of each country to be consistent, it is necessary to establish an organization at this time to strengthen the connection between the organizations, establish the organization, and gather the system. While establishing a system of consolidated total power, it is necessary to improve the domestic movement system. In particular, the youth movement is the driving force of each movement, so it is necessary to improve the comprehensive system. After a short break at noon, the meeting continued in the afternoon until it adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Japan Issues Statement on the Second Anniversary of the Tripartite Alliance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Tripartite Military Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy on the 11th, German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer issued a statement on the 10th, stating in essence: Britain and the United States, knowing that the spirit of combat between Japan and Germany is solid, have repeatedly used naive propaganda to spread rumors among the allied groups and attempt to disrupt the wartime rear lines, but this foolish attempt has failed. Now that we have grasped the main conditions for victory, in order to encourage the soldiers fighting on the front lines, we should renew our common oath and do everything possible to win the ultimate victory.</p>
<h3>Fierce Encounters Unfold in the Arakan Region on the Burmese Border; Anti-Axis Forces Acknowledge the Solid Japanese Defenses</h3>
<p>Colombo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the Cairo Conference, Britain has been promoting that the Mountbatten forces will attack Burma, and is preparing to bomb Burma with the air force stationed in India. However, judging from the Japanese air force's preemptive bombing of Calcutta on the 5th, it is clear that the enemy has no chance to take advantage. At the same time, the Japanese army is actively conducting vigilance activities on land. In the Arakan region, Japanese army reconnaissance teams repeatedly engage in fierce encounters with the anti-Axis forces. On the northern border of Burma, the Japanese army is also putting heavy pressure on the Chongqing forces defending the Ledo Road, indicating that the Japanese army's defenses are extremely solid. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command issued a communiqué on the 8th, acknowledging the above facts, stating: In the Arakan region, the anti-Axis forces and Japanese army reconnaissance teams have engaged in fierce fighting over the past week. In northern Burma, the Japanese army has attacked the Chongqing forces defending the Ledo Road, and their positions have been strengthened.</p>

<h3>Total Amount of Central Reserve Bank Notes Issued Still Far From Saturation Point; Chen Zhi Explains Current Currency Issues</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Chen Zhi, Vice Minister of Finance of the National Government, met with reporters yesterday and explained the current currency issues. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current circulation status of the Central Reserve Bank notes? (Answer) The Central Reserve Bank authorities have always been cautious about issuance, constantly seeking countermeasures suitable for the environment, and paying particular attention to the tightness or looseness of credit and the abundance or scarcity of quantity. They strive to ensure that the amount of currency in circulation matches the national economy and social finance. Currently, the total amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued is still far from the saturation point, considering the current currency needs and economic situation.</p>
<p>(Question) Rising prices are closely related to currency issues. From the perspective of currency issues, what are the countermeasures for prices? (Answer) The value of goods is related to currency issues, but the major cause of rising prices in a wartime state is the difficulty in smooth transportation and the inability of supply and demand to correspond. As a result, there is a shortage of materials and a phenomenon of rising prices. Therefore, increasing production and smoothing transportation are urgent tasks.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the specific implementation steps for absorbing idle funds? (Answer) Regarding the absorption of idle funds, there are various methods such as encouraging savings and restricting hoarding, which have been disclosed in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. In the future, they should become more concrete in order to adjust them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Issues Weekly War Situation Report; 19 Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The press department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced on the 10th the weekly war situation, stating that the Japanese army completely captured Changde on the 3rd. Chongqing hurriedly dispatched the Liang Hanming and Fang Xianjue armies to rescue Changde, but they were intercepted by the Japanese army and suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army encircled and annihilated the Chongqing Reserve 10th Division in the Leijiaji area, and then encircled and attacked a strong unit of the Chongqing army flanking the Japanese army near Qijiahe. A mopping-up operation is currently underway in various areas near Changde. The Japanese army air force is coordinating with the above troops, intercepting Chongqing aircraft attacking Changde, and achieving great results. A total of 19 (P40) type aircraft were shot down. Since the start of this operation, Chongqing has suffered heavy losses in soldiers and weapons. Since losing Changde, they have no other options. Mobilizing more troops will only increase losses.</p>

<h3>Vice Minister Yuan of the Interior Explains Work Policy; Decides to Strengthen Wartime Administrative Agencies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Interior held a regular press conference at 3 p.m. on the 10th, attended by more than a dozen Chinese and foreign reporters. Minister of Interior Mei was busy with official duties and was represented by Vice Minister Yuan, who elaborated in detail on the department's recent work and future work plans. The general idea is as follows: After our country entered the war, in order to conform to the wartime system in terms of administration, the fundamental policy is to strengthen the administrative agencies. Regarding the central aspect, there is no need to repeat it. As for the strengthening of the entire local administrative agencies, the Ministry of Interior is actively promoting it. The progress can be divided into two aspects: civil affairs and police affairs. In terms of civil affairs, one is to strengthen the organization of the county government, and the other is to strengthen the Baojia system and improve the people's organization, so that the government's awareness of policy implementation can permeate the people. Regarding police affairs: Execute the resolutions of the National Police Conference. Formulate wartime measures for imposing fines for violations of police regulations. Improve the treatment of the police. Prepare the economic police organization.</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches by Mayor Zhou and Minister An</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The gist of the speeches by Mayor Zhou (represented by Secretary-General Lu) and Minister An at the Capital Sino-Japanese People's Joint War Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou delivered the opening remarks on behalf of Secretary-General Lu, expressing gratitude for the hard work of the soldiers of the allied nation over the past two years in completely driving the British and American forces out of East Asia. We should express our thanks. We are very confident in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The people of China and Japan should cooperate closely and help each other to make the Greater East Asia War proceed more smoothly and to complete the construction of Greater East Asia as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Minister of Information An's speech briefly stated that the Greater East Asia War is a decisive battle between all the peoples of East Asia and the invading British and American peoples. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has won consecutive victories, and has finally driven the British and American forces out of East Asia. The significance of the East Asian peoples jointly building a new East Asia is also becoming clearer day by day. China and Japan have developed a relationship of sharing weal and woe, and have formed a unified action to seek the liberation of East Asia. The recent Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo brought together the leaders of six countries. The British and American forces that have invaded East Asia for a century will be eliminated from now on. In terms of the naval achievements in the Pacific over the past two years, a total of 31 enemy battleships, 29 aircraft carriers, 150 cruisers, and 7,000 aircraft have been destroyed, and approximately 400,000 soldiers have been killed. Because they have too much manpower and resources, they are sending more, so the war results we have achieved are also greater. In the current development of the situation, everyone must have the belief that the Greater East Asia War will be victorious, and so on.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia War and China's Responsibility: An Article by Finance Minister Zhou</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the request of the Continental News here, Minister of Finance of the National Government, Zhou Fo Hai, specially wrote an article entitled "The Greater East Asia War and China's Responsibility" for the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The gist is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Allied nation of Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed. In these two years, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have been invincible in every battle and have swept away the aggressive forces that Britain and the United States had cultivated in East Asia for a century. Their aggression in East Asia, such as in Burma, the Philippines, and Malaya, has been completely lost. The nations and peoples of East Asia have been able to achieve independence and autonomy, and the foundation for the prosperity of Greater East Asia has been established. However, to achieve the final victory in the war, all nations and peoples of East Asia should cooperate fully with all their human and material resources to achieve the common goal as soon as possible. The Greater East Asia Conference held last month was a concrete manifestation of strengthening unity, and it can also be said to be the general engine for East Asian nations to jointly defend and build East Asia.</p>
<p>Recalling that two years ago, after Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with Japan. In January of this year, it even went further and joined the war, determined to live and die together, cooperating with the friendly nation of Japan. As a member of East Asia, China must naturally devote all its strength. Our country has launched national revolutionary movements several times. Not to mention the distant past, but the revolutionary movement led by the National Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, aimed to seek freedom and equality for China. The reason why China cannot achieve freedom and equality is because the imperialists manipulate the situation. Therefore, China does not want to complete the revolution. If it wants to complete the revolution, it must drive out the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism.</p>
<p>China does not currently have the power to directly assist in the Greater East Asia War, but it will make the greatest efforts to increase production and establish security. China is in the rear, and a stable rear can relieve the worries of the soldiers at the front. Increased production and smooth transportation can help the offensive power of the front. The great achievements of the Allied nation of Japan's military and political authorities in the past two years are truly admirable. The National Government is doing its best to establish security and increase production. This is where China can contribute to the Greater East Asia War. We are determined to build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the outline of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to do our best.</p>

<h3>German Envoy to Italy Promoted in Rank</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency: German leader Hitler, based on the proposal of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, promoted the rank of the German envoy to Italy, Reine, to ambassador.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Future War Situations; Germany Is Prepared for Any Eventuality; It Is by No Means Easy to Attack Europe from the East and West</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: Military correspondent Setorius said: The Tehran Communiqué has clearly mentioned concentrating on attacking Germany or Europe. Britain and the United States have accepted the restrictions of the Soviet Union and are not just paying lip service as before. Although the date of the attack has not been decided, the Soviet Union may focus on the British and Americans launching a winter offensive on the Western Front to cooperate with the Soviet army's offensive on the Eastern Front. However, time is short, and the British and American staff departments are not prepared. There are approximately 50 divisions of infantry, tank units, and air force on the British Isles, but there is a significant lack of ships. If the anti-Axis powers take the bombardment of German defense industries, the destruction of European transportation facilities, and the plunder of Germany's internal operational advantages as prerequisites for attacking Western Europe, then attacking Western Europe will be difficult to achieve. Furthermore, well-informed British and American sources also point out that air strikes cannot have this effect. However, the political pressure of the Soviet Union may outweigh military considerations and urge Britain and the United States to take action in Western Europe to respond to the Soviet army's winter offensive. The development of the situation is difficult to predict. The attitude of the Soviet Union can be regarded as a sign of future development. If the Soviet army cannot launch a winter offensive this year, it can prove that the British and Americans, due to the urgency of time, will implement the plan agreed upon in Tehran to attack Europe next spring. From a military point of view, the anti-Axis army's attack on Europe will focus on the eastern and western fronts, while the southern front is secondary, but the southern front cannot be ignored, because the anti-Axis army is already fighting in Italy, and reinforcements are also very convenient. The problem of reserve troops involves the problem of ships, and British and American transport ships must serve both Europe and the Pacific. The need for ships in the Pacific has recently increased, not only because the American army has suffered heavy losses, but also because Britain and the United States are intensifying their operations against Japan to maintain their prestige. The anti-Axis army's attack on Southern Europe may be from the Balkans, not from Italy, and the British army has lost its springboard for attacking the Thessaloniki area due to the loss of the Aegean islands.</p>
<h3>Japan and Germany Gain the Time Factor to Strengthen Combat Power and Echo Each Other</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency military commentator Luns Lappan commented on the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference, stating: The military situation of the anti-Axis side has shown an unstable image, which is sufficient to indicate that major events are brewing behind the battle line. The indecision of the anti-Axis camp regarding future developments can be seen in the deployment of its staff department, and the main reason is that both Germany and Japan maintain sufficient reserve forces. Therefore, the anti-Axis powers' deduction that the German army has been pushed to the brink of a decision after the Soviet army has made progress and the British and American terrorist air raids have caused damage is a misunderstanding. Furthermore, there is a belief that Japan, due to the remoteness of the communication lines, can be easily destroyed if a large number of naval and air forces are used to attack it. This view is even more absurd. Balancing the military situation of the past few months, although Germany and Japan have abandoned some of the territories they had previously conquered, they do not attach too much importance to the current war and only concentrate their strength and energy to increase their power and train new troops. The time factor gained by Germany and Japan is very important and will prove to have a serious impact on the enemy. The general war situation that is currently pointed out is sufficient to experience the theme discussed at the Tehran Conference and the Cairo Conference. Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have previously suffered significant losses and will make greater military sacrifices. The Germans are not being defeated in 1943 as the enemy had expected and are not harmed in the slightest. The Japanese army has also achieved success in its naval defense posture, and the Americans have suffered a crushing defeat. The global strategy expressed by the enemy has proven to be merely propaganda, and Germany and Japan have a relationship of common interests, so they can be completely coordinated. The goals of the enemy are different, so their joint strategy must be weaker and less effective than that of the Axis. The concentration of combat energy in the rear by Japan and Germany cannot be hindered by the enemy. Therefore, the main motivation for the two conferences in Tehran and Cairo is clearly to realize the ineffectiveness of military measures. Victors do not need to meet frequently. From this perspective, the establishment of a second front is only an attempt, because the resistance of the German army is particularly strong, so the second front is used as propaganda to establish a psychological pincers, not a military pincers. However, military success is sufficient to determine this war, and important military events are being prepared. From the German point of view, the enemy will advance from both the east and west, and the German army's saving of manpower and material resources in 1943 is implemented according to a certain plan. The enemy's desire to know the content of this plan is the focus of the two conferences in Cairo and Tehran. The enemy is trying to find a new springboard as a stepping stone for advancement, but the German army is prepared. The German military leaders trust their own military strength and calmly await the development of the situation. The reaction of the German army is making the enemy nervous and anxious, even more so than the impact the enemy has on the German side. The strength of Germany will make the British wonder how long the war can be delayed.</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Aviation League Holds Emergency Congress in Japan; Plans to Increase Aviation Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to enrich and strengthen aviation combat power, the Greater East Asia National Aviation Enhancement League held a general congress of the 1 billion air war emergency general advance at the Imperial Hotel here at 11 am on the 10th.

<h3>Gomel, North Soviet Army, Launches New Offensive; Shortening German Defense Line of the Dnieper Pocket</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: The central section of the Eastern Front has been quiet for a week. The Soviet army has launched an offensive between the Pripet and Berezina Rivers, intending to attack the flanks of the German front in the Rogachev Mogilev area. At the same time, there is also a concentration of Soviet troops in the Zhlobin area, and there are fears that they may also be preparing to attack. However, the Soviet army made no progress the day before. The German army's offensive between Zhitomir and Korosten continues to make progress. The center of the fierce battle in the Dnieper River area is still southwest of Kremenchug, at the railway intersection of Znamenka, which the enemy has failed to seize. Northwest of Znamenka, the Soviet army has made slight advances and has made contact with the troops advancing from Alexandria, but it has still failed to encircle the main force of the German army. The German front has been strengthened and strengthened a lot. West of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army's fierce attack in heavy fog failed. There has been no change in the situation in Crimea.</p>
<h3>Severe Cold and Snow on the Eastern Front Make Tank Warfare Difficult</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military command announced on the 9th that the fighting in the main war zones of the Eastern Front has gradually slowed down due to the arrival of winter and the severe weather, and mechanized units are also finding it increasingly difficult to operate. Snow has fallen in all of the northern front and most of the central front, and although the roads are frozen at night, they are not suitable for large-scale operations. The Soviet army in the Nevel area is carrying out aerial supply due to the difficulty of land supply, but it is often hindered by fog and snow. There is also a thin layer of snow in the northern part of the southern front, and the Kiev area is gradually becoming muddy. The average temperature in the Greater Dnieper Pocket is minus 6 degrees Celsius. On the 8th, the Soviet army used heavy fog to increase its strength in the Kremenchug and Znamenka areas. The German army west of Kiev made some progress again on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Says Diplomatic Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Ankara, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with a group of reporters from the anti-Axis and neutral countries on the 9th to announce the details of the British-American-Turkish talks in Cairo. He stated that the alliance treaty between Britain and Turkey has been further strengthened through this meeting, and at the same time, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and the Turkish government is the same as the relationship between Britain and Turkey, becoming even closer. During the meeting, the reporters asked whether, as a result of this meeting, Turkey was one step closer to participating in the war. The Turkish Foreign Minister replied that the Turkish government's diplomatic policy has not changed in any way.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Turkish President Ismet returned from Cairo, the Turkish political circles have suddenly become unusually tense. An interim cabinet meeting was held on the 7th to hear a report on the Cairo talks. Furthermore, People's Republican Party members will also hold a secret meeting on the 14th, where Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu will report on the process so that the policy adopted by the Turkish representatives at the Cairo talks can be approved.</p>
<h3>Strong German Defensive Position on the Road to Rome; German Troops Withdraw from the Monte Camino Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency News: The battle in southern Italy on Wednesday confirmed and supplemented the developments of the major battle for the past few days. The German resistance and counterattack has overturned the calculations of General Montgomery and General Clark. British and American prisoners admit that they have to deal with an entire defense system in the mountains and valleys, not just the German front line that they were informed of. The enemy has recently made slight progress along the road to Rome, but this short distance of progress is hardly worth mentioning. The German army's deep echelon defensive power has nullified the importance of this small progress by the enemy. The situation in the Monte Camino area is relatively calm. After completing its objective, the German army in that area withdrew on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Decisive Battle Has Not Yet Come; Declares US Secretary of War</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency's Washington report, US Secretary of War Stimson declared: The battles of the British and American forces in North Africa, Sicily, and Southern Italy are only "peripheral battles". The decisive battle at sea and on land has not yet arrived. The war will only reach a decisive stage when there is a fierce battle with a large number of German troops on the European continent, or when our navy breaks through Japan's strong domestic fleet, which is not far from the end of the war.</p>
<h3>Rommel Inspects Danish Defenses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Total War Posture of Berlin Women; Order Quickly Restored After Air Raids</h3>
<p>From November 22nd to 26th, Berlin was bombed for four consecutive days. During these five days, the enemy was only demonstrating on the nights of the 24th and 25th. The actual bombing mainly took place on the nights of the 22nd, 23rd, and 26th, especially the first two nights. On the night of the 23rd, the Berlin branch of the Asahi Shimbun was also burned down, and the branch staff, like ordinary Berlin citizens and overseas Chinese, hurriedly fled to the streets with their belongings. Fortunately, they were able to find temporary accommodation by the 24th. After the 26th, there were no more alarms. Thinking back to the situation of the "Berlin battlefield" for a week until today, the 29th, my heart has calmed down. The 22nd was a dark night with light rain, which was not conducive to the German air defense activities. The 23rd was also a dark night, and the embers of the Berlin city streets had not yet been extinguished. The fires in various parts of the city were a good target for the enemy's bombing. Therefore, the enemy's bombs were quite accurate, and the German air defense activities were unable to exert their power due to being blocked by the dark night. The number of aircraft that came on these two nights totaled 350 and 550, and 29 aircraft were shot down each day, which is considered a poor performance for the German air defense. On the 26th, the weather was clear, and the German air defense activities were very active, so the enemy did not bomb as freely as before. It is said that the amount of bombs dropped on the first two nights exceeded two-thirds of the amount of bombs dropped in a week to destroy Hamburg.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, transportation in Berlin had to be partially suspended, and the wreckage of burned trams and cars could be seen everywhere on the streets. The buildings were emitting smoke, and the citizens were carrying luggage and fleeing. However, the authorities' emergency countermeasures were very proper, and the citizens were fully prepared, so the evacuation and restoration were very rapid. The elderly and young had already been evacuated, so most of the remaining Berlin citizens are now active people.</p>
<p>Active Young Women</p>
<p>The most notable among them is the activity of young women. Almost all young men have gone to the front line, and the young women have inherited their responsibilities and are able to fulfill their duties very competently, which is admirable. The great bombing of the two days has changed the face of Berlin, but thanks to the authorities' thoughtful countermeasures and the citizens' autonomous cooperation, the path to recovery has been quickly taken in the midst of the unextinguished embers. Its speed is truly a microcosm of an organized country like Nazi Germany and cannot but be admired. A week later today, transportation, communication, and other things have probably been restored to their former state, and a stable situation has been seen in the midst of great destruction.</p>
<p>The enemy's purpose in this air raid was to depress the morale of the Berlin citizens and even the entire nation, but it completely failed. The inhumanity of the enemy has made the nation's will to resist even more enhanced. The German government authorities are very satisfied with the autonomous spirit and vigorous fighting spirit shown by the Berlin citizens during this bombing. On the 24th, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, who returned from a trip, stood in front of the destroyed embassy and said with emotion: "This is the state of total national war." Indeed, the situation in Berlin today depicts a profound state of total national war. The Berlin citizens have broken through the greatest trial this time, and the enemy's expectations have all fallen through. Recently, the German newspapers have vowed to retaliate against Britain and praised the resolute attitude of the Berlin citizens. (翔: Translated from the December 1st Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Citizens Should Be Prepared for Air Defense and Fire Prevention; Important Talk by the First District Fire Department</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News: The Fire Department of the First District Public Office, in view of the recent situation and the occurrence of large and small fires, issued the following statement: "At this time of decisive battle, in order to prevent enemy air raids, all residents of Shanghai must unite as one, prepare air defense and fire prevention materials, intensify training, and be prepared at all times to seek the safety of the rear and to achieve victory. In peacetime, we must be careful to prevent fires, and must not allow important materials to be damaged under wartime conditions. As it is easy to have fires during the winter season, we hope that the citizens will cooperate and prepare each other, and air defense and fire prevention should not be neglected. The following is a description of what the citizens should know":</p>
<p>Psychology That Should Be Had Regarding Air Raids</p>
<p>The psychology that citizens should have regarding air raids: (A) Do not have unnecessary panic about air raids. Some citizens panic at the first sound of an air raid alarm. The reason is that they think that the bombs will definitely hit, and that either people will be injured or homes will be destroyed by fire. However, there is no way that all of the bombs dropped will hit. This kind of psychology must be eliminated, and unnecessary panic should not arise. One must be calm to deal with it. (B) Maintain a strong spirit of air defense. The destructive power of the bombs dropped is very small. The reason why they are able to show more power than they actually have is that the spirit of the citizens is weak, and they are afraid of the enemy's air power. If the citizens have a strong spirit, they should calmly defend themselves or follow the various measures taken during the drills, and there will be no fear. Therefore, a strong spirit of air defense is an essential requirement for citizens. (C) Hold firmly to one's duty. Modern warfare has no distinction between the front and the rear. Shanghai, where we live, is also a battlefield, and it is the place that should be guarded most firmly. All citizens, regardless of nationality, should unite as one and resolutely defend this great Shanghai. (D) Complete air defense techniques and prepare air defense spirit. It is difficult to win if one only has a strong spirit and does things empty-handed. The resources of air defense must be prepared and enriched, and the training must be thorough. All practical air defense techniques must be practiced. (E) Citizens are all air defense soldiers and should participate in the war together. There is no distinction between the front and the rear. Except for the elderly, the young, and others who do not have the ability to carry out air defense activities, the rest are mostly air defense soldiers. Once an air raid comes, all citizens must rise up together and give full play to their abilities. The leather is a well-trained air defense technique, so that the damage is limited to a minimum to protect our great Shanghai. Ordinary fire alarms should be reported to the fire department. When a fire occurs in the first district, call 1544 or 00 and shout to the fire department to report the fire. When talking to the personnel on the line at the fire department, you must be extremely calm and focus on telling the location of the fire, indicating the name of the road and the house number. If it is in a lane, indicate the road name, lane number, or name, as well as the house number, so that the firefighters can rush to the scene to rescue.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Shanghai Company Gifts Maps</p>
<p>The Shanghai Company on Jing'an Temple Road, which recently opened and is experiencing booming business, is giving away large Shanghai maps with a comparison table of new and old street names in appreciation to its customers. They are novel, unique, and practical. It is said that the giveaway is limited to 20,000 sets.</p>
<p>Economic Circle Review</p>
<h3>Rationing System</h3>
<p>The fuel problem is as serious as the food problem, or even more so. The food problem in the future is very dire because since the implementation of rationing in Shanghai, there has never been a "grain shortage" situation like in the past two months, because the household grain allocation has become a mere formality!</p>
<p>However, we should not be overly pessimistic about the future of food supply in the city. The Rice Control Council has the responsibility and the capability to find ways to secure food sources. From the recent talks between the chief secretary of the First District Office and the newly appointed director of the City Food Bureau, we believe that the future of the rationing system will not remain so bleak for long, because the success or failure of the rationing system depends entirely on whether two key aspects of food allocation can be resolved: first, whether the allocation can be sufficient, and second, whether the allocation can be on time. Insufficient supply and untimely delivery are the biggest factors causing panic over household rice and the biggest factors driving up black market rice prices. In other words, they are the biggest causes of the instability of the entire people's livelihood. According to the chief secretary of the First District Office, "The District Office will devote all its efforts to implementing rationing of major items to bring the city situation back to normal. At the same time, in the economic aspect, we will work hard to implement the rationing system and strive to increase the allocation amount." According to the new Director of the Food Bureau, "Shanghai's food supply must work to improve the people's livelihood. The household rice that citizens are concerned about must be allocated on time and not delayed." We hope that the above two wishes can be realized simultaneously; otherwise, the rationing system will be equivalent to "drawing cakes to satisfy hunger."</p>
<h3>Approved Reservation Quotas for Fabric Manufacturers' Raw Materials Formally Approved by the Commercial Control Council</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Fabric Manufacturers Association has requested a reservation quota for cotton yarn and cloth purchases for its member factories. The Cotton Industry Management Office has reviewed and approved a one-month reservation quota based on the average amount of raw materials used for fabric production by each factory from January to June of this year. This has been formally approved by the Commercial Control Council, and the approved reservation quota will be used as the standard for future allocations. It is reported that the cotton textile industry, Chinese-owned yarn mills, and the cotton yarn and cloth business associations have also requested the Commercial Control Council to approve the reservation quotas for their respective industries.</p>
<h3>Small Flour Mills to be Managed</h3>
<p>There are many small mechanized flour mills and stone mills in this city, and their daily output and product standards vary widely, making it difficult to allocate raw materials. Because the scale of the mills is simple, they are also difficult to manage. It is now known that the relevant authorities will implement comprehensive management of all flour mills in order to unify the centralized purchase and distribution of flour. Certain necessary adjustments will be made to small flour mills. It is reported that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has formulated interim measures for the management of small mechanized flour mills and stone mills, which have been approved by the Commercial Control Council and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Registration of Saltpeter Manufacturers Ends This Month</h3>
<p>In order to understand the current situation of saltpeter manufacturers, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Three-Province Saltpeter Bureau convened responsible persons from relevant trade associations last month for discussions, which yielded very satisfactory results. It is now learned that the bureau has begun registering saltpeter manufacturers, and the deadline is the end of this month.

<p>Central News Agency report: Yesterday, December 11, the second anniversary of the conclusion of the military pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy delivered a speech declaring Japan's determination to complete the war.</p>
<p>Fighting Common Enemy</p>
<p>Minister Hirota said: "The 11th is the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. The Tripartite Alliance was concluded on September 27, 1940. On December 8, 1941, Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. At that time, Germany was at war with Britain and also declared war on the United States.

Later, the supplementary agreement further integrated the Tripartite Alliance, prohibited separate peace negotiations, and stipulated that the two countries would also cooperate in building a new order after the war.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Advantage</p>
<p>The enemy is now attempting to attack, whether on the European front or the East Asian front. However, in Greater East Asia, the South Pacific, Bougainville Island, the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands, and other places, the enemy has suffered disastrous defeats. In the Burma-India campaign, the Japanese army has launched attacks on Yunnan and conducted air raids on Calcutta. The Japanese army has gained the upper hand everywhere. In the European front, Germany's European fortresses are becoming increasingly solid. On the eastern front, it has voluntarily withdrawn due to strategic considerations. However, it appears that the Soviet Union has almost stopped attacking, while Germany is launching offensives in the Kyiv area. On the Italian front, the British and American forces have not demonstrated the strength to launch an offensive.</p>
<p>Political Offensive</p>
<p>Therefore, after the Cairo talks, Britain and the United States held the Tehran Conference, attempting to launch a political offensive. They have held numerous meetings, such as in Moscow, Quebec, Washington, and Casablanca. However, the results of each meeting only reveal the cracks between the anti-Axis countries, exposing their weak posturing. On the contrary, the Axis powers, Japan and Germany, do not feel the need for meetings. Although Japan and Germany are geographically isolated, the close cooperation and mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs stipulated in the alliance treaty and military agreement have been fully implemented.</p>
<p>No Compromise</p>
<p>The people of Japan and Germany have absolute determination to fight and will not lay down their weapons until final victory. The people of both countries deeply know that their fate is tied to this war. The enemy is eager for a quick victory, but we are determined to cope with any long-term war. This is not only a matter of determination but also demonstrated by our past victories. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. We also have the firm determination that there will be no compromise peace in this war, only the unconditional surrender of the enemy. At that time, our determination will be realized, and it will also be the day we promise the world to complete the construction of a new order. We are determined to advance courageously with the people of the world towards building a new world order.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"Makoto... shall we go play?"</p>
<p>Makoto had grown to the age where children often came to play with him.</p>
<p>"Hum..."</p>
<p>At that time, Makoto was not a child who would say no to going. But even if he was said to be a child, he would sometimes not just run off, but would choose his playmates. At that time, mothers in Tokyo would usually say a wonderful phrase to their children: "Wait a while." Children in Kagoshima did not have that kind of phrase, but Makoto would never refuse a friend's invitation.</p>
<p>Among the two or three children, the closest was the one whose house was the furthest away. It was a new residential area that was gradually becoming lively. The father worked in the city's public ward, so the construction of the house, the family's circumstances, everything had a scholarly atmosphere. The lifestyle was the exact opposite of the Katani's, but the children got along well. Both of them were eight years old before they could go to school, so the period of playing together was naturally very long.</p>
<p>"Makoto, isn't my name taken from Mr. Saigo's name (Note: Saigo Takamori was a famous general of the Meiji Restoration - translator's note)?... Taka..."</p>
<p>The young Mutaguchi, named TakaO, used this to show off to Makoto. That place worshipped Lord Nanshu, so their names all had a "Taka" or "Sheng" in them. But a child like Takao was not worthy of this name. He had a weak, small body, only his head was disproportionately large, he was a scrofulous child.</p>
<p>"What a nice name!"</p>
<p>Makoto really thought his friend's name was good.</p>
<p>He often went to play at Takao's house, which had a phonograph. He only had one younger sister, Shizuko. The house was very clean, which was like heaven and earth compared to the mess in Makoto's house. Because the children liked excitement, they were not happy to wait in this cold house.</p>
<p>As long as it didn't rain, the two of them would go to the beach to play all day. The Tenpozan coast was the next beach. It was only one or two chō (360 feet) away. Pale reddish white sand, gnarled old pines, the blue-green sea of Kinko Bay, and Sakurajima, which was always emitting smoke, were spread out before their eyes. At that time, the Tenpozan hot springs had not yet been discovered, and the tourist road had not been built. It was no different from the era when the navy of Shimazu Nariakira flourished. Everywhere was a vast sandy beach, and the children walked endlessly. The flowers of the beach cotton and bottle gourd were in full bloom, throwing stones, breaking pine branches, no one interfered. The children's opponent was this beautiful nature. Speaking of the beauty of the world, only the nature of Shenmo Beach.</p>
<h3>Reading Mr. Hai Su's Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>— Wu An</p>
<p>"Emerald Peak in High Autumn"</p>
<p>This painting is colored in blue and green, meticulously and beautifully depicting an autumn mountain that is bright and quiet like makeup, not entering the vulgar customs, with a light and clear atmosphere, and a serious brushwork. It is truly indebted to the use of shading.</p>
<p>"Fishing in the Snow"</p>
<p>The painting uses ink and wash to depict Liu Zongyuan's poem "Thousands of mountains, birds fly away, ten thousand paths, people disappear, a lonely boat, an old man in a straw cloak. Fishing alone in the cold river snow," with a high and ancient brushwork, a grand atmosphere, and a biting coldness.</p>
<p>"Layered Greens of Linglan"</p>
<p>The entire painting is shaded and rendered with heavy colors, depicting high mountains and flat foothills, dense trees and secluded pavilions, with various shades of red and green, resembling a clear and sunny spring mountain. However, the mastery of fire is unique, and the rhythm is natural.</p>
<p>"Two Steeds"</p>
<p>The Social Works Department's Dan Qing Yin presented to General Cao Ba has a saying: "... Hoping that the True Dragon of the Nine Heavens will emerge, sweeping away the emptiness of ten thousand horses for all ages. ... The general is good at painting and possesses divine skill. He will surely meet a talented person and also paint his portrait." Mr. paints two steeds, one standing and one lying down, with several willows planted behind, colored with light ink. The brushwork is peculiar and ancient.</p>
<p>"Cattle Herd"</p>
<p>This piece is a horizontal scroll, depicting a vast wilderness plain in ink and wash, with three to five grazing cattle placed on it, each with a different posture, backed by mountains, and with withered branches, small grasses, and a winding stream below. The ever-changing layout fully captures its beauty.</p>
<p>"Windswept Rain"</p>
<p>This huge painting in ink and wash fully expresses the force and sorrow of "the same sigh of wind and rain," although the paper is full of dripping ink and flying brushstrokes, there is not a single stroke without stillness.</p>
<p>"Imitation of Mi Yunshan Painting"</p>
<p>Yunshan did not originate with Yuanzhang (Mi Fu), but actually came from Wang Qia's ink splashing in the Tang Dynasty. Mi Fu, with his lofty and elegant nature, developed it into a painting of dripping ink and wash, done spontaneously, with misty clouds, simple trees, and was called Mi's Yunshan. Mr.'s imitation of Mi Yunshan is spiritual but not similar, a fine structure in Huju painting.</p>
<p>"Red Cliff"</p>
<p>The painting depicts towering cliffs standing upright, with several ancient trees hanging upside down on them, and endless mountains. A bright moon hangs in the sky, and below, a lone boat carries sailors and three guests, each with a different expression. The intention imitates Liu Ru, with delicate brushwork and a close rhythm.</p>
<p>Note: Mr. Liu Haisu's painting exhibition is the last day today. I hope those who love this art will go and see it, and not miss the opportunity.</p>
