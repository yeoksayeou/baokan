<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>上海市民福利協會的特殊性</h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>不論那一種團體，凡是屬於地方性，而由一部分智識份子，爲愛護地方一般人民的利益，而組織成功的他的功用，必定直接間接，有裨於國家的政策或政令。尤其當國家多事之秋，時局動盪之際，倘沒有這一類的組織，出來維持推進，政府有時難以應付，人民亦不免失所依恃。武斷的政治家，抱着國家萬能的偏見，以爲人民既歸一個國家統治，受統治只有承受，不應該有自動創造，只有服從，不應該有建議。不知承受和服從，固然是不可動搖的原則，在這原則下的自動和建議，不獨沒有衝突，並且使施行力量愈革固，愈周密，所以議會政治，無不測騐政黨之傾向，就是獨裁政治，甚至共產政治，亦需要人民團體之擁護。世人往往稱這種團體，爲民意機關，殆非無因</p>
<p>上面所說的，是一般人民團體的泛論。倘再加以分析，還有兩大區別。其一是多少帶些政治性質的，又其一是全不帶政治性質的。全不帶政治性質的，專就人民本身的利益，如何能得到合法的保障，至於現政治的動向，並無硏究討論的餘地。這就是本文所說的成立不久的上海市民福利協會。這協會籌備了兩個多月，從本年四月八日開成立大會到現在，經過了三個月，陸續參加的會員，已有九十七人，受理市民請求事件十起，會內會外的文牘交際，日不暇給。雖然沒有公布的報告，而與協會接觸過的各界人士，均已瞭解他的性質，似乎無須急急的表白。可是望遠鏡的觀察，總不免有此糢糊，或者和從前過去的地方協會市民協會，等量齊觀，而於該會的特殊性，輕輕看過，這是覺得狠可惜的。</p>
<p>所謂上海市民福利協會的特殊性，是些什麼？郤有主要的意義，下面列舉三點，可以窺見一斑：</p>
<p>第一點不急求近功——凡是一個新團體的產生，大家多眼巴巴的渴望着做出許多事業來，如並不見什麼顏色，就漸漸的淡漠下去，好像起初是希望他有無所不能的技術，日久就看做虛有其表的贅施。豈知凡百工作，多應該不斷的繼續，並不像打仗的要一鼓作氣。市民福利，在現在情况之下，誠然有急迫援助的必要，但終須踏穩脚步，敏愼周廻，樹立起有效有恒的基礎。否則一蹶不振，虎頭蛇尾，又又何必多此一舉呢？</p>
<p>第二點不顯示厓岸——同樣的兩個團體，目的相同，事業相同。然而究其內幕，各有各的本領，各有各的路數，雖不至像商家的同行嫉妬，郤總有些陽迎陰拒。上海市民福利協會理事委員，無一非上海各團體的有力分子。縱然所辦的事，有獨立標新的色彩，但決沒有什麽彼此親疎的歧視。只要合於本會宗旨者，均一律爲之疎解抉掖，直看做和自己的事一樣。任何勞苦不辭，任何成功不居，這是全體會貝的信條。</p>
<p>第三點不高談理論——『理論爲事實之母』，這是純粹的哲學論。若是眞正的實行家，必須把握住事實。任你如何的高談闊論，姑且放在一邊。大學的『知止而後有定』就是這個道理。上海市民福利，全是現實的事件。協會只曉得把這事件，切實的機變的做去。倘要擴大範圍，提高目的，暫時惟有存而不論。　本月十日將召集第二次决會員大會，特借申報星期評論的篇幅，不辭譾陋，發抒鄙意，如有卓見，願承明敎。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>米價飛漲主管機關應速籌對策</h3>
<p>近日米價黑市在漲不已，我們在街頭巷尾，聽到的是爲米價而長吁短嘆，看到的是爲米價而愁眉苦臉。「民以食爲天」，民食問題實佔民生問題中最重要的地位，今米價在漲，迭創高峯，直接威脅人民生活，如何不叫人民情急呢？</p>
<p>糧食部是政府主管民食的最高機關，米糧聯營社是調節民食的實施機構，有了明確的職權，就要運用之以完成使命。政府對於安定民生的話，說得多了，管理民食機關，也應有盡有了，爲什麽事實的發展，完全背道而馳呢？所以，我們認爲主管機關職責所在，亟應趕速決定對策，以挽在瀾。</p>
<p>據傳華北方面雖糧食缺乏，但經主管機關運用種種有效方法，已使糧價减低十分之三四，那末，華中方面糧食供應決不如華北之困難，反狂漲不已，究竟其故安在？</p>
<p>民食是民生中最要的一點，如果民食調整，束手無策，那末，安定民生，將從何說起！</p>

<p>行政院訓令各省市政府　嚴禁侮慢友邦婦孺　如再有侮慢事情發生　無論大小均按律懲辦</p>
<p>南京三日中央社電　行政院近以中日關係更趨親密。而竟有市井下流，對於友邦人士，尤其婦孺，往來通衢僻巷，加以侮慢，或出無禮之言，殊屬非是，且難保無匪僞厠身其間，乘機滋事，特訓令首都警察總監署，各省市政府，及蘚淮特別區公署，如經發覺此類情事，無論大小，槪行按律分別懲辦，茲誌訓令原文如下，中國參加大東亞戰爭以來與友邦日本，立於同一戰綫，同甘苦，共死生，以求大東亞戰爭目的之完遂，即以求中國之解放。友邦日本更援助中國完成獨立自主，提前交還租界，撤廢治外法權。數月以來，先之以交還專管租界，最近更進一步，交還上海公共租界。百年以來，英美加於中國之桎梏，一旦打破，中國多年之希望，一旦實現，中日兩國親善關係，益以鞏固，中日兩國國民友誼，亦必因此敦篤，同時中國國民，尤應懍使命之重大。負荷之不易，平日與友邦人士相周旋，益常本於休戚相關之熱誠，出以謙恭自重之態度，庶幾兩國國民。情意日益親稔，而本身道德、亦以淬勵之故，而日益健全近接情報，知首都等處竟有市井下流，在通衢僻巷，對友邦人士往來，尤其婦孺，加以侮慢或出無禮之言，成爲下流卑劣之舉動，桃撥惡感，暴棄人格。此等劣行，深可痛恨，且難保無渝共匪僞厠身其間，乘隙滋事，以遂奸謀。着首都警察總監曁各該省市政府嚴行查禁，如有以上情事發生，無論大小，即當按律分別懲辦，以儆效尤面臨盧囂風。更有言者，凡爲國民，均應打破「自了漢」之思想，各個國民善必相勸，過必相規，親受精誠，實繫於此。上述惡行，固屬下流匪類所爲；但有智識有品格之人士，若能以社會風紀爲念，耳目所及，立予矯正，則愚妄自知歛迹，罪惡無從發生。倘認爲事不千已，置若罔聞，則放棄責任，試問良心能否無愧。着有敎育訓練責任之各機關，一體注意，養成善良風俗，敦飭人格，即所以維護邦交，有厚望焉。此令，院長在兆銘。」</p>

<h3>日潛艇搜索敵船　完成偉大戰果　六月份擊沉敵船十一艘</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　大東亞戰爭開始後司，日軍以其電學作戰，瞬即在東四一千里，南北一萬里之廣大海岸上，以强力之補給交通戰，維持戰略綫，而壓迫敵軍，使退至南太平洋東隅及東太平洋。此種態勢，實已可謂爲絕對不敗之持久地勢，但反觀敵方，不但不能挽囘現在之頹勢，即對於接近日方前綫之登陸部隊，亦不能實行必要之增援，故日潛艇之目標，現亦由初期之攻擊艦蜓主義，而變爲破壓敵方增援路綫，以　沉敵運輸船爲目標，而在太平洋以及印度洋上，佈置嚴密之監視網，搜索敵船，太平洋並非如地中海之狹小，更無如直布羅陀之可節制要隅，敵船之往來，亦不如大西洋上之頻繁，故搜索工作，極爲困難，但徵諸日大本營三日一發表中謂六月份共擊沉敵船十一艘，計八萬五千噸之戰果，實已相當偉大，此十一艘敵船內最大者，的爲一萬五千噸至二萬噸，故自開戰以來，所擊沉之敵船，合計已有三百八十艘，共達二百三十三萬五千噸。</p>
<h3>日來華經濟考察團　招待記者發表談話　該團將與中國財界巨頭舉行懇談</h3>

<h3>德掃蕩蘇後方　獲偉大戰果</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德元首大本營二日曾發表戰報，詳述德軍於東棧中部地區後方，掃蕩蘇軍遊擊隊之戰况後，德軍常局復於是日加以補充說明稱，德軍對蘇軍遊擊隊之掃蕩，已於一日結束，收獲莫大戰果，是役德軍攻佔蘇軍陣地一百九十四處，及特火點四百廿二座，並殲滅蘇遊擊隊一萬〇三百七十六人，更擊毀其飛機一架，運輸滑翔機五十架，德軍並鹵獲重砲十九門，對戰車砲九門，迫擊砲十八門，重機槍三十挺，輕機槍三十一挺，對戰車槍十六挺，無綫電收音機九架，及其他甚夥。又德軍佔領地之蘇聯住民，及義勇隊，亦曾對德軍予以莫大之協力。</p>

<h3>英美遷延政策　蘇表示不滿</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電　邱吉爾於表示、反軸心軍於歐洲上陸作戰，將延至秋爭後，使蘇聯對第二戰綫之期待，極感失望。最近當地所得莫斯科與論，均謂蘚聯對英美兩國之　延態度，甚表不滿，例如華盛頓明星報之莫斯科特派員三日消息稱。義聯對軸心軍之一般作戰計劃，尤其對第二戰綫遷延情形，更爲憤恨，二因美國失的，中止供給蘇聯食糧，故蘇聯之憤怒情形愈甚。莫斯科記者亦謂，若反軸心軍僅以佔據西西里克特島等地中海島嶼，或於法國海岸奪取根據地爲目的，則蘇聯對此次不滿足，又反軸心軍之歐陸作戰準備，亦未能收得牽制東綫德軍之效果，據莫斯科來電，六月三十日之眞理報會戰一文，攻擊英美之宣傳工作，缼欠確實，茲述如次，英美兩國曾謂德國已自東錢抽調大量兵力配備於挪威法義巴爾幹等海岸一帶，然三月以來，東綫德軍兵力，迄未减少，反形增强，此足見英美所傳非實也。又二月之蘇聯英文報紙莫斯科新聞亦傳德軍當局，已自四歌向東綫增派多數精銳兵力云，</p>

<h3>日本確立　戰時學生動員計劃（二）</h3>
<p>加強增產糧食上的動員</p>
<p>增產食糧爲目前當務之急，農林·內務·文部·厚生四次官曾聯名發出關於增產食糧的文告，動員全國各方面的勞力，利用荒地，向增產食糧之途邁進。關於學生的增產食糧動員，文部，農林二省的次官響應前述文告，於二十五日對各府縣長官發出下述文告，更加强原有的勞働動員。交告的要騐知次：</p>
<p>（一）因勞力不足而現有空地者，使中等學校以上的學校積極的協力各農會各農業團體共同耕作。</p>
<p>（二）農業學校的學生的實習，學校農塲的經營，集中於增產食糧關於學校外的食糧增產，則以勞働協力作業的方式以充之。</p>
<p>（三）農村區域的國民學校高等科及初等科學年兒童，考慮各地農會的要求，延長其停止授業的期間。</p>
<p>（四）關於派遣內地農學校的長期停留的學校報國隊，特別希　有適當的指導。</p>
<p>（五）除使各學校利用原有農塲及可供利用的校地以增產食糧外，利用附近的各種　地，閑地設置報國農塲，輪替動員各級學生種植適於各地方的食料農產物。</p>
<p>（六）各學校除農繁期的動員外，利用休息日作耕食料農產物，並使其可能的從事於堆肥，刈草，蒐集木灰，改良土地工事等工作。</p>
<p>（七）本勞働動員所需要的宿合，寢具，農具，種子等，由各行政官的，關係團體協力幹旋，必要時並幫助其經費廳一部。</p>
<p>（八）本勞　動員所需要的經費及其他，擬予以相當的援助，（翔：節譯自六月二十六日西部朝日新聞。）</p>
<h3>美國勞工糾紛之透視</h3>
<p>美國大總統羅斯福拒絕簽署禁止罷工法案，將該法案重付參議院審議，參院以五十六票對二十五票否決大總統之否決權，並移送衆議院，衆院與參院取一致態度，正式決定爲吾決法律。大總統對議會因煤鑛罷工問題而引起正面衝突，形勢至堪重視。</p>
<p>羅斯福至最後一刻卒發動大總統之否決權，拒絕彈壓法案，足徵羅斯福對解決罷工之措置已然費苦心，同時，觀望國內諸勢力之動向從，卒決定不惜與議會一戰態度。</p>
<p>彈歷法案之提出議會，其直接目標自爲反對煤礦組織，自各產業組織會議以至於較爲順從政府之美國勞工總同盟，對此均展開猛烈之反對運動。萬一該法案正式通過成爲法律，則預料將誘致美國全勞働階級之大團結，獎國軍需生產反將陷於不可收拾之狀態。且明年又屈大選之期，故羅斯福幾經考慮，而筏出此。</p>
<p>然大總統此種模稜態度，反引起議會方面之意外的反羅熱，參院接受大總統敎合後，不出五分鐘即採擇吾決拒絕權之動議，可知上院對此次羅總統之措置如何激昻。贊成彈壓法派亦與原來之反羅斯福派合流，拒絕大總統之法案，政府對以前稱爲國賊之約翰路易斯，事實上已告屈服。</p>
<p>且軍部方而對羅斯福所提代替彈壓法案之提增徵兵年齡案。尤爲反對，彼等主張如將罷工人收容於軍隊，將使有光榮之軍隊成爲一種懲治監獄，對美軍士氣，或許有不測之惡劣影影。</p>
<p>因此。煤礦糾紛一變而爲政府對議會之政治鬥爭，共形攀極爲混沌。</p>
<p>美國參衆二院吾決大總統之拒絕而正式成立之罷工彈壓法內容要旨如次：</p>
<p>第一條　本法定名爲戰時勞工爭議法。</p>
<p>第二條　有關各事項之定義。</p>
<p>第三條　關於沒收各種戰時生產機構。對大總統賦與法律上權限。</p>
<p>第四及第五條　關於戰時勞工局之指令，在某種塲合之其他勞工僱傭，規定維持現行條項。</p>
<p>第六條　對經營中之工廠及鑛山有嗾使，指揮，或幫助罷工情事，政府以刑事犯處斷之</p>
<p>第七條　對戰時勞　局賦與法律上之權限，規定上述權限之各條項。</p>
<p>第八條　關於或將阻害戰爭關係生產之重大糾紛，勞工代表負有通知勞工長官。戰時勞工局幷勞工關係局之義務，勞工關係局接受通知後，於第三十日在各該工廠或鑛山執行勞工者間之秘密投票，決定應吾停止工作。</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福關於罷工彈壓法案及提早徵兵年齡之論令全文如次：</p>
<p>余對所謂戰時勞工爭議法案，茲不予以承認而加以退還。該法案所含問題甚多，並非簡單法案。該法案與阻止戰時罷工之法制並無關係，反含有誘致怠工乃至罷工之條項。更懷疑參衆二院對此等條項所及於軍需生產之影響是否持有充分檢討之機會。據該法案第八項，基於戰時勞務契約之被傭人代表，在阻害軍需生產有重大威脅時，對戰時勞工局，勞働關係局，應報告上述爭議之條項，如此，對被僱傭人將用秘密投票以表示彼等是否認爲有阻害軍需生產之意志。然上述條項中，基於勞働團體之指導者不得罷工之誓約，雖應阻止罷工，但不能不先予以通告，其結果，如依賴秘密投票，反將促進罷工。在戰時中，雖將不預先通知，但不能有罷工情事。第八項完全漠視勞働界不得罷工之誓約，承認罷工之預告及罷工投票，所以阻止罷工者，反將增大勞工界之不安。因此，余茲修正選擇的服務法，希望至六十五歲止之美國人民，負有從事戰鬥以外之軍事勞役的義務。經此修正後，將可使罷工及其他在美國政府支配下之工廠中有誘致停止乃至妨害工作之美國人，役於軍事勞役。（　：譯自六月二十七日東京　　報知　　廷京城電）</p>

<h3>工部局闡明　米糧供應情形　配給機構轉移本期暫行減縮　商店利用政治局勢擅自抬價者嚴懲</h3>
<p>工部局情報處公告云：查由於最近上海米糧食油配給組合之改組關係，食米之運滬，雖經中日當道之種種努力，不無稍感遲延，結果戶口米之配給數量，因之暫時酌减。</p>
<p>口米核減一時現象</p>
<p>本局對於此次配給戶口米之延緩，與夫配給數量之暫時核减，表示遺憾。但此種情形，完全由於米糧配給機構之轉移與華方當道以後，食米到滬暫時感受不得已之滯延而起，本局深信一俟中國當道之種種必要準備完成以後，一切情形，仍可恢復舊規，切盼市民方而對於奸商所造謠言，勿予輕信。須知奸商之目的，在乎犧牲大衆，而惟私利是圖也，</p>
<p>造謠惑眾嚴峻處置</p>
<p>近來不法商民，膽敢利用此種機會，製造毫無根據之謠言，狂抬黑市米價以圖自肥，若輩除抬高黑市米價以外，復擾亂經濟市況，危害社會之安甯與秩序，本局有鑒於此，決定對於此等不法商民，採取嚴峻惜置，</p>
<p>警告商店勿抬物價</p>
<p>此外，本局警告一般商店，切勿私抬物價，其有利用最近政治局勢而擅自抬高售價者，本局定予嚴懲，良以此類商店不特危害本市，抑且構成擾亂政治與經濟情形之犯罪行爲，關於此層本局當與中日當道合作，對於奸商處以最嚴峻之罰則。希望市民對於此種步驟之重要性，能充分明瞭。</p>
<h3>食米十五萬包　已在運滬途中　米糧聯營社押運來滬　戶口米缺數可予補足</h3>
<p>本埠食米問題，因採辦機構之移轉關係，本期戶口米數量，稍形减縮，惟工部局情報處公告，已鄭重申明，當局盡力設法補足。據向米糧聯營社負責人方面探悉：本埠民食配給，決無問題。目前由於不得已之原因，米糧運滬，而致延遲者，純屬暫時現象。現在有食米十五萬包，已在運滬途中，此項大宗米糧來源，計蘇州米糧管理處撥運十萬包，湖州米糧倉庫撥運三萬包，揚州米榖聯營社撥運二萬包，該社業已派員赴以上三處，押運米糧來滬，上項食米到滬後，本期戶口米之缺數，即能如數補足。同時中支食米配給所前所採辦存儲於棧房之食米尙豐，必要時亦可由關係當局，設法商借濟用，故居民儘可安心，毋須杞憂自擾。</p>
<h3>當局嚴峻措置　取締非法黑市　決依法制裁以靖市面</h3>
<p>本市物價近日突飛猛漲，一般民生莫不大起恐慌，其主因完全受黑市操縱所致。造放謠言，煽惑人心，擾亂市情，市區有關各當局，昨已派員嚴密澈查，緝獲不肯市儈，想不久漲風、當可完全平戢。</p>
<p>烚赤</p>
<p>按烚赤早爲當局嚴予取締，不料近日各銀樓商及投機者突又藉政治之演進，造謠惑衆，暗抬售價，一日轉變黑市條金交易，竟縱高×××之鉅，其銀樓門市飾金掛牌，照限價每兩售出××××，並變相增加手續費每兩一日間×××××。此項手總費本有一定之目標，何異烚赤變相漲價。</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<p>糧食近年以來，經當局採取戶口配給制後，民食供給，稍感平衡，人心頗能安定，不料近日流言籠翠，黑市米價由此逐日漲高，尤以昨（三）日漲勢最厲，事經當局獲悉，即派員密查，拘獲米販，一嚴予懲辦，午後漲風始見低落。按本市糧食在當局配給米之存貨異常充裕，且最近糧食部與友邦在滬常局向內部產區採購大批米糧，疏通運滬，是以民食供給，決無匱乏之虞，外傳流言，全屬無稽，並聞配給戶口米，將即恢復，並有增加配給計口糧數量之議。據悉各有關常局對於黑市交易，及非法抬高物價，已有嚴峻取繚之措置。</p>
<h3>三期人造奶油定期配給</h3>

<h3>義演助賑　豁免娛樂捐　以工都局名義　集成整數捐助</h3>
<p>上海各界華北急賑會，爲籌集捐款，積極策助各劇塲義演助賑，並呈請工部局，將三成娛樂捐豁免，撥充賑款，業經工部局函復，待集成整數後，由工部局名義，將此項捐款助華北念賬。按此項辦法，即爲工部局將所得之娛樂捐，集成整數，解交華北急賑曾指定代收捐款之銀行，充爲賑款，另數不足，則由工部局補足，惟最高額以二十萬元爲限。</p>
<p>山西同鄉演劇籌賑</p>
<p>此次華北災情嚴重，上海各界熱忱募款，籌辦急賬，山西旅滬同鄉會，對於故鄉災情，允深懸系。茲爲籌集念賬款項起見，定於本月五日下午，假黃金大戲院演劇籌賬，即將所得券資。悉數捐賬。並由李芳大使及婦女福利協會會長趙文漪女士，親自登台。同時並由李世芳及全體藝員，各演其平生傑作。想好善樂施之士，當無不樂予贊助也。</p>

<h3>造紙廠業請求　取消電力限制　以增生產藉維文化發展</h3>
<p>本市造紙業同業公會，因電流限制，生產上頗受影影，故特備文分呈寶樂部。上海特別市政府，請求設法取銷限制，俾可儘量生產，藉維文化。呈文略云：屬會會員，雖有十七家，但多數設於共同租界。各廠生產量，因電流用量，被公司限制過嚴，較事變前减至二分之一，而每月工作，不及滿月，甚或開工數日，電力即告用罄。而社會需要紙張迫切。查上海電力公司，原以燃料缺乏，不得已而節電。現煤斤來源暢通，存底充沛，即不能全部開放，最低限度，亦應予工廠用電便利。若不擇緩念，一概限制，以致出品奇缺，黑市暴貴，既碍當局抑平物價之苦心，復違戰時增加生產本旨，殊非賢明之措置。屬會默念文化前途之危機，謹備文上陳，伏祈俯賜鑒察，准予轉咨日本大使館，飭令上海電力公司，對各造紙廠用電，取消限制，俾可儘量生產，藉維文化，國家幸甚，社會幸甚。</p>

<h3>收回租界後的上海經濟</h3>
<p>上海公共租界，將於八月一日不復存在，過去公共租界是英美侵華的根據地，自由主義。經濟充斥，形成了畸形的狀態，今租界交還，歸國府直接管理，當有澈底的轉變，　建設新中國之途徑，而努力改進。可是。有若干問題，可得指陳，最重要面顯著者，就是囤積行爲，尙未消滅，企圖利用物資統制的新機構，攫取非法的利潤。其原因雖有多種，但行政機構的太複雜，實爲主因。因爲這種關係，一切有闌經濟的犯案，難以作張有力的制裁，實深遺憾！</p>
<p>此次國府收囘租界，對於租界經濟，當可根本修改。實行調整，從此上海經濟的機關，可以統一，把行政系統上的障碍完全除去，寶現統制一元化，而到完善姿態。同時上海爲中國經濟心臟區，一切關係，萬分重大，租界接收以後，希望對於負責實際工作的職員人選與機構運用，特別的愼重考慮調整。（雲鵬：譯自七月三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>今日工商界的責任</h3>
<p>— 陸廷芳</p>
<p>近頃一般經濟學者，對於現階段之中國各種經濟問題，如物資之缺乏，生產之萎縮，物價之高漲、幣値之穩定，交通之阻滯，遊資之運用，利率之統制，金融機關之更新，投機行爲之消滅，資金市塲之建立，配給制度之擴充等等。大半皆寄其期望於政府常局之措置與解決。蓋戰時經濟之統制，須自當局作自上而下之領導，或用立法手段，訂定民間經濟行爲之軌跡，或用行政手段，指導民間經濟行爲之途徑，凡此均原爲不能更易之定則，而各國行之又不乏成效者。</p>
<p>惟我國今日之情形，有一特殊之點，爲各國所無，即工商界之心理病態。吾人深知『政府當局對於統制經濟之方策，不但早具成竹，且已在着着推進；而對於民間意見，亦復虛心採納、不遺餘力；吾人對此苦心孤詣，實寄其無限祟高之敬意。然吾人若一返顧工商界之內在情形，則覺吾人之心境上留一陰影。今日工商界，因時局之演變、實際上已陷入掙扎困憊之境地，固屬無容諱言，然吾人設若能認識時局，能與當局協力，積極的作適合環境之改逸，則此種困偹掙扎之境地，無甯謂爲黎明以前之黑暗。惟吾工商界人士，徘徊於自由主義之門，迷惘於「最後勝利」之脫者，仍極繁多。此種病態心理，種因既久，淸除甚雖。其結果則爲暴利主義之猖獗，資金之運用不復遵循正當之途徑；工商業者之一切活動，亦不復以民生利益爲前提，於是，對於政府之統制，作種種迥避之行動，而對於生產事業之推進，缺乏自發自勵之熱忱。無形之中，削弱經濟建設之力量，而工商獎者之本身，益陷入於掙扎困憊之局而不能自拔。藍既存之物資既屬有限，生產情形又復不振如斯，加以人人皆欲以一轉手之勞而坐得厚利，縱當局之限價統制爲如何嚴密，物價之上漲，終爲不可避免之現象。於是輾轉相因，獲其利者固爲工商業的本身，受其害者，亦莫非工商業的本；因物價上漲之結果，一方面爲相對的貨幣購賣力之削弱，而致消費者因限於經濟能力不能不减少其消費的程度，一方面則工商業老設以一百元之代價出售其商品，勢不能不以高於一百元之代價再行補進，結果賬面上雖獲盈餘，而實際所保存之商品反行减少。此種現象，已爲有識者所深愛，不予補救，必將釀成極嚴重之後果，而補救之道，即在於謀物價之穩定，除當局之種種措置外。尤須工商業之自重自愛。從事工商業者當知，現時所行之暴利政策，其所獲利潤，典其謂爲取自營業，無甯謂爲獲自掠奪；掠奪而得之財物，縱能確保，於心亦屬不安。况其所釀成之一切不良後果，仍將由　商界身受之乎？國府參戰以後，一切施政，均以經濟建設爲前提，對於常前之經濟現狀，正步步進行改善，此正工商界可循正常途徑力圖發展之時機，吾工商界人士其能放棄追求暴利之觀念。而以服務社會，調劑物資之供求分配爲已任乎？工商界自重自愛，不僅可使當局减少許多勞費，實亦社會人羣之福音。</p>

<h3>The Special Characteristics of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of organization, any that is local and organized by a group of intellectuals to protect the interests of the general public in the area will inevitably benefit the country's policies or decrees, directly or indirectly. Especially in times of national crisis and upheaval, if there are no such organizations to maintain and promote them, the government may find it difficult to cope, and the people will inevitably lose their support. Autocratic politicians, clinging to the prejudice of national omnipotence, believe that since the people are governed by a country, they should only accept governance and should not have automatic creation; they should only obey and should not have suggestions. They do not realize that acceptance and obedience are indeed unshakable principles, but automatic action and suggestions under these principles not only do not conflict but also make the implementation of power more solid and thorough. Therefore, parliamentary politics invariably measures the tendencies of political parties, and even dictatorial politics, even communist politics, require the support of people's organizations. The world often calls such groups public opinion bodies, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>The above is a general discussion of people's organizations in general. If we further analyze it, there are two major differences. One is somewhat political, and the other is completely apolitical. Those that are completely apolitical focus solely on the interests of the people themselves, how to obtain legal protection, and there is no room for research and discussion on the current political trends. This is the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, which was established not long ago and is mentioned in this article. This association has been in preparation for more than two months. Since the inaugural meeting on April 8 of this year, it has been three months. The number of members who have joined successively has reached ninety-seven, and the number of cases requested by citizens that have been accepted is ten. The internal and external correspondence of the association is inexhaustible. Although there is no public report, people from all walks of life who have been in contact with the association have understood its nature, and it seems that there is no need to express it urgently. However, telescopic observation is always inevitably vague, or equated with the local associations and citizens' associations of the past, and the special characteristics of the association are lightly overlooked, which is considered very regrettable.</p>
<p>What are the special characteristics of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association? There are, however, major meanings. The following three points can give a glimpse:</p>
<p>The first point is not to seek immediate success—whenever a new group is created, everyone eagerly hopes to do a lot of work. If no results are seen, they gradually become indifferent, as if they initially hoped that it would have omnipotent technology, and over time they see it as a superfluous decoration that is useless. How do you know that all kinds of work should be continuously continued, and not like fighting a war, you need to do it in one go. Under the current circumstances, citizens' welfare does indeed have an urgent need for assistance, but it must take steady steps, be prudent and thorough, and establish an effective and lasting foundation. Otherwise, a setback, a tiger's head and a snake's tail, then why bother?</p>
<p>The second point is not to show off one's abilities—the same two groups have the same goals and the same cause. However, upon closer inspection, each has its own abilities and its own ways. Although it does not go so far as to cause jealousy among merchants in the same industry, there is always some superficial welcome and secret resistance. The directors and committee members of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association are all powerful figures in various Shanghai organizations. Even if the things they do have an independent and innovative color, there is absolutely no discrimination of closeness or distance. As long as it is in line with the purpose of this association, it will be relieved and supported uniformly, and treated as if it were its own business. No matter how hard the work is, no matter how successful it is, this is the creed of all members.</p>
<p>The third point is not to talk about theories—"theory is the mother of fact" is a purely philosophical theory. If you are a true practitioner, you must grasp the facts. No matter how much you talk about grand theories, put them aside for the time being. The university's "knowing where to stop, then there is determination" is the same principle. Shanghai citizens' welfare is all real events. The association only knows how to do this event in a practical and resourceful way. If you want to expand the scope and raise the purpose, you can only reserve it for the time being. The second membership meeting will be held on the 10th of this month. I would like to take advantage of the space in the Shanghai Daily's Weekly Review to express my humble opinions, without being ashamed of my ignorance. If you have any brilliant ideas, I would like to receive your guidance.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Soaring, Competent Authorities Should Quickly Devise Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Recently, black market rice prices have continued to rise. What we hear in the streets and alleys are long sighs for the price of rice, and what we see are frowning faces for the price of rice. "The people regard food as heaven," and the people's food problem is the most important part of the people's livelihood problem. Today, the price of rice is rising, reaching new highs, directly threatening people's lives, how can people not be anxious?</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food is the highest government agency in charge of the people's food, and the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative is the implementing agency for regulating the people's food. With clear powers, they must be used to accomplish the mission. The government has said a lot about stabilizing people's livelihood, and the agencies that manage people's food should also have everything they need. Why is the development of the facts completely contrary to this? Therefore, we believe that the competent authorities have a responsibility to quickly decide on countermeasures to reverse the tide.</p>
<p>It is said that although there is a shortage of food in North China, the competent authorities have used various effective methods to reduce the price of grain by 30-40%. Then, the food supply in Central China is definitely not as difficult as in North China, but it is rising wildly. Where is the reason?</p>
<p>People's food is the most important point of people's livelihood. If the people's food adjustment is helpless, then where will the stability of people's livelihood start!</p>

<p>Executive Yuan Orders Provincial and Municipal Governments to Strictly Prohibit Insulting Allied Women and Children; Any Insulting Incidents Will Be Punished According to Law, Regardless of Size</p>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Executive Yuan recently issued an order stating that the relationship between China and Japan is becoming closer, but there are still vulgar elements in the market who insult Allied personnel, especially women and children, going to and from the streets and alleys, or make rude remarks, which is not appropriate and may lead to bandits and spies taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, the Executive Yuan ordered the Capital Police Headquarters, provincial and municipal governments, and the Xin Huai Special Zone Office that if such incidents are discovered, regardless of size, they will be punished according to law to serve as a warning. The original text of the order is as follows: Since China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, it has stood on the same front as its ally Japan, sharing weal and woe, and seeking the completion of the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, that is, seeking the liberation of China. Our ally Japan has also assisted China in completing its independence and autonomy, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality ahead of schedule. In recent months, first the specialized concessions have been returned, and recently, the Shanghai International Settlement has been returned. The shackles imposed on China by Britain and the United States for a hundred years have been broken in one day, and China's long-cherished hopes have been realized in one day. The friendly relations between China and Japan have been further consolidated, and the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will also be deepened as a result. At the same time, the Chinese people should be mindful of the great mission and the difficulty of bearing the burden. In their daily interactions with Allied personnel, they should always be based on the sincerity of sharing weal and woe, and show a humble and self-respecting attitude, so that the feelings between the people of the two countries will become more and more cordial, and their own morality will be tempered and become more and more sound. Recent intelligence has revealed that there are vulgar elements in the market in the capital and other places who insult Allied personnel, especially women and children, going to and from the streets and alleys, or make rude remarks, resulting in vulgar and base behavior, provoking resentment, and abandoning personality. Such inferior behavior is deeply hateful, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no Chongqing Communist bandits and spies hiding among them, taking the opportunity to cause trouble and achieve their evil schemes. The Capital Police Headquarters and the provincial and municipal governments concerned are ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit such incidents from occurring. If any of the above incidents occur, regardless of size, they shall be punished according to law to serve as a warning to others. Facing the noisy wind in Lu, there are also those who say that all citizens should break the "selfish" mentality, and all citizens should advise each other on good deeds and correct each other on faults. Sincerity is closely related to this. The above-mentioned evil deeds are indeed committed by vulgar bandits; however, if people with knowledge and character can take social morality into consideration and correct them as soon as they see them, then the foolish and ignorant will know to restrain themselves, and crimes will have no chance to occur. If they think that it is not their business and turn a blind eye, then they are abandoning their responsibility. Ask yourselves whether their consciences can be clear. All agencies with educational and training responsibilities should pay attention to cultivating good customs and exhorting personality, which is to maintain diplomatic relations and have high hopes. This order, President Wang Zhaoming."</p>

<h3>Japanese Submarines Search for Enemy Ships and Achieve Great Results: Eleven Enemy Ships Sunk in June</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has used its electrical warfare to maintain strategic lines with strong supply and transportation warfare on the vast coast of 4,000 miles east to west and 10,000 miles north to south, while suppressing the enemy forces and forcing them to retreat to the eastern corner of the South Pacific and the East Pacific. This situation can be said to be an absolutely invincible and sustainable situation, but on the contrary, the enemy not only cannot reverse the current decline, but also cannot implement the necessary reinforcements for the landing forces approaching the Japanese front line. Therefore, the target of Japanese submarines has now changed from the initial principle of attacking warships to suppressing enemy reinforcement routes and sinking enemy transport ships as targets. A tight surveillance network has been deployed in the Pacific and Indian Oceans to search for enemy ships. The Pacific Ocean is not as small as the Mediterranean Sea, and there is no such thing as Gibraltar to control the key points. The traffic of enemy ships is not as frequent as in the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the search work is extremely difficult. However, according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 3rd, a total of eleven enemy ships with a total of 85,000 tons were sunk in June, which is a considerable achievement. The largest of these eleven enemy ships was 15,000 to 20,000 tons. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, a total of 380 enemy ships with a total of 2,335,000 tons have been sunk.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Investigation Group to China Gives Talks to Reporters: The Group Will Hold Sincere Talks with Leading Figures in the Chinese Financial World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): The China Economic Investigation Group organized by the Japan East Asia Economic Roundtable Meeting will soon depart for China. The head of the group, Ogura, and Messrs. Akashi and Nango, specially invited a group of reporters here yesterday to give talks, explaining the mission of the investigation group. The general idea is that the central task of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere lies in the proper resolution of Sino-Japanese relations, that is, in close cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural aspects to realize the ideal of so-called common life and death. Looking back at past Sino-Japanese relations, there has been cultural and economic communication, but it is still not cooperation. However, after the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's implementation of its new policy toward China, figures in the Chinese financial world have generally believed that the time for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has already matured. Therefore, our visit to China at this time is of great significance. As for our mission, it is to hold concrete talks with leading figures in the Chinese financial world and the National Government on economic cooperation between the two countries, and to fully accept the opinions of Chinese people. Therefore, we will not only take collective action, but also plan to hold private talks to exchange views. During this visit to China, economic issues in China, such as prices, finance, trade, and food, are all issues that we should study fully. If the results of our sincere talks with figures in the Chinese financial world can be beneficial to the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries' industries and economies, then that would be fortunate.</p>

<h3>General Matsui Iwane's Speech in Vietnam: The Fundamental Policy Towards Vietnam Remains Unchanged; Expecting the Vietnamese to Develop Great Power</h3>
<p>Saigon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - General Matsui Iwane of Japan, before departing for Bangkok on the 3rd, met with a delegation of Vietnamese journalists here on the afternoon of the 2nd and gave a speech, stating roughly: I came to Vietnam thirty years ago and stayed in Tonkin for a year. I also came here fifteen years ago, so I am deeply concerned about the situation in Vietnam. This is my third visit. The people of Vietnam have given Japan the greatest cooperation, and Japan is grateful for this. Japan's policy towards Vietnam is based on eradicating the root of misfortune in East Asia and establishing lasting peace in East Asia, which is the core of the relationship between Japan and Vietnam. It is not limited to the Japan-Vietnam economic agreement, but aims to increase the happiness of Vietnam. The relationship between Japan and Vietnam may change in the future, but Japan's fundamental policy towards Vietnam will never change. Japan will take necessary measures to increase the happiness of Vietnam. You must understand that the future destiny of Vietnam depends entirely on the spirit of the Vietnamese nation. I have studied the history of Vietnam carefully, and I always sympathize when I read about the great powers invading Vietnam. However, I do not want to encourage you to launch a revolutionary movement. No matter how the European situation changes, Japan is determined to drive British and American forces out of East Asia, and it is still proceeding steadily. Therefore, the future of Asia is a bright world. The future of Vietnam is also predictable. I sincerely hope that the Vietnamese people will not forget the spirit of their motherland, be aware that they are members of Asia, and fully develop their great power.</p>
<h3>Germany Sweeps the Soviet Rear, Achieves Great Results</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced a battle report on the 2nd, detailing the German army's campaign to sweep up Soviet guerrillas in the rear of the central region of the Eastern Front. The German High Command added a supplementary explanation on the same day, stating that the German army's campaign to sweep up Soviet guerrillas ended on the 1st, achieving great results. In this campaign, the German army captured 194 Soviet positions and 422 special fire points, and annihilated 10,376 Soviet guerrillas, also destroying one aircraft and fifty transport gliders. The German army also captured nineteen heavy cannons, nine anti-tank guns, eighteen mortars, thirty heavy machine guns, thirty-one light machine guns, sixteen anti-tank rifles, nine wireless radios, and many other items. Furthermore, Soviet residents and volunteer corps in the German-occupied territories also provided great assistance to the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency learned from military circles that General Vlasov's Russian soldiers cooperated with the German army on Thursday to fight against Soviet guerrillas, protecting the rear railway lines and highways in the central section of the Eastern Front. This Russian army is mostly composed of captured Soviet soldiers who later volunteered to participate in the anti-Bolshevik war. Several Cossack battalions, led by their original officers, also fought alongside the army, demonstrating their reliability in several decisive battles. Many have been awarded for their bravery. In June, a planned bombing by Soviet guerrillas was avoided due to the attention of these local troops. A team of these Russian soldiers fought against a team of Jews attacking villages and townships. The Jewish bandits suffered heavy casualties, their camps were destroyed, and many of their weapons, ammunition, explosives, and a printing press were captured.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Anglo-American Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>Argentina Capital, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Churchill's statement that the Allied forces' landing operation in Europe will be delayed until after the autumn has greatly disappointed the Soviet Union's expectations for the Second Front. Recent Moscow commentaries obtained locally indicate that the Soviet Union is very dissatisfied with the delaying attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States. For example, the Moscow correspondent of the Washington Star reported on the 3rd that the Soviet Union is even more resentful of the Allied forces' general war plan against the Axis powers, especially the delay of the Second Front, because the United States has stopped supplying food to the Soviet Union. Moscow reporters also said that if the Allied forces only aim to occupy Mediterranean islands such as Sicily and Crete, or seize bases on the French coast, then the Soviet Union will not be satisfied with this. Furthermore, the Allied forces' preparations for operations on the European continent have also failed to achieve the effect of restraining German troops on the Eastern Front. According to a dispatch from Moscow, an article in the June 30th edition of Pravda attacked the Anglo-American propaganda work, saying it lacked authenticity. It stated as follows: The United Kingdom and the United States have said that Germany has transferred a large number of troops from the Eastern Front to be deployed on the coasts of Norway, France, Italy, and the Balkans, but since March, the strength of the German troops on the Eastern Front has not decreased, but has instead increased. This shows that what the United Kingdom and the United States have said is not true. Furthermore, the Soviet English newspaper Moscow News reported in February that the German authorities had increased the number of elite troops sent from the south to the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Tangier, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Radio Algiers broadcast last night that the French Committee of National Liberation will hold a meeting today, chaired by General de Gaulle. De Gaulle's position has gradually strengthened due to the two changes in military and political positions in Algiers. His subordinate, General Bergeret, has replaced Colonel Tighalenri as the director of the Military Advisory Council (Note: Tighalenri was under General Giraud in France). In addition, Picot has been appointed as the director of the Civil Advisory Council. Picot has held diplomatic positions in Moscow, Sofia, Chongqing, and Washington.</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Wartime Student Mobilization Plan (2)</h3>
<p>Strengthening Mobilization for Increased Food Production</p>
<p>Increasing food production is currently an urgent task. The four vice-ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Interior, Education, and Health jointly issued a statement on increasing food production, mobilizing labor from all over the country, utilizing wasteland, and moving towards increasing food production. Regarding the mobilization of students for increased food production, the vice-ministers of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry responded to the aforementioned statement and issued the following statement to the governors of each prefecture on the 25th to further strengthen the original labor mobilization. The main points of the statement are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In areas where there is currently vacant land due to a lack of labor, schools above the middle school level should actively cooperate with various agricultural associations and agricultural organizations to cultivate it together.</p>
<p>(2) The internships of students at agricultural schools and the operation of school farms should be focused on increasing food production. Regarding food production outside of schools, it should be supplemented by means of labor cooperation.</p>
<p>(3) The period of suspension of classes for higher grades and elementary school children in rural areas should be extended, taking into account the requests of local agricultural associations.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the dispatch of school patriotism corps to agricultural schools in the mainland for long-term stays, special attention should be paid to appropriate guidance.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to having each school use its existing farms and usable school land to increase food production, use various nearby lands and vacant lands to establish patriotism farms and rotate students of all levels to plant food crops suitable for each region.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to mobilization during the busy farming season, each school should use rest days to cultivate food crops and, if possible, engage in work such as composting, mowing grass, collecting wood ash, and improving land.</p>
<p>(7) The accommodation, bedding, agricultural tools, seeds, etc. required for this labor mobilization should be handled jointly by each administrative official and related organizations, and financial assistance should be provided when necessary.</p>
<p>(8) The expenses and other costs required for this labor mobilization will be given considerable assistance. (Note: Translated and excerpted from the Western Asahi Shimbun, June 26.)</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Labor Disputes in the United States</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt refused to sign the anti-strike bill, returning the bill to the Senate for review. The Senate rejected the President's veto by a vote of 56 to 25 and transferred it to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives adopted the same attitude as the Senate and formally decided to override the law. The situation in which the President and Congress have come into direct conflict over the coal mine strike issue is highly concerning.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's decision to exercise his presidential veto at the last minute and refuse to suppress the bill shows that Roosevelt has put a lot of effort into resolving the strike. At the same time, he observed the trends of various domestic forces and finally decided to risk a battle with Congress.</p>
<p>The direct target of the bill proposed by Congress was to oppose the coal mine organization. From the various industry organization conferences to the more compliant American Federation of Labor, all launched fierce opposition movements. If the bill were formally passed into law, it was expected to induce a great unity of the entire American working class, and the production of military supplies would be in an irreparable state. Furthermore, the next general election is approaching, so Roosevelt considered it carefully and decided to issue this.</p>
<p>However, the President's ambiguous attitude unexpectedly aroused the opposition of Congress. The Senate adopted the motion to override the veto within five minutes after receiving the President's teaching, which shows how激昂 the upper house was about the President's actions this time. The faction that supported the suppression bill also merged with the original anti-Roosevelt faction to reject the President's bill. The government has in fact yielded to John Lewis, who was previously called a traitor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the military department was opposed to Roosevelt's proposal to increase the conscription age to replace the suppression bill. They argued that if strikers were taken into the army, it would turn the glorious army into a kind of penal prison, which might have an unexpected adverse effect on the morale of the American army.</p>
<p>Therefore, the coal mine dispute has turned into a political struggle between the government and Congress, and the situation is extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>The main points of the anti-strike law formally established by the US Senate and House of Representatives overriding the President's veto are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: This law is named the Wartime Labor Disputes Act.</p>
<p>Article 2: Definitions of relevant matters.</p>
<p>Article 3: Regarding the confiscation of various wartime production facilities. Grants legal authority to the President.</p>
<p>Articles 4 and 5: Regarding the instructions of the Wartime Labor Board, other labor employment in certain situations, stipulating the maintenance of existing provisions.</p>
<p>Article 6: Anyone who incites, directs, or assists a strike in an operating factory or mine will be punished by the government as a criminal.</p>
<p>Article 7: Grants legal authority to the Wartime Labor Board, stipulating the various provisions of the aforementioned authority.</p>
<p>Article 8: Regarding major disputes that may hinder war-related production, labor representatives have the obligation to notify the Secretary of Labor, the Wartime Labor Board, and the Labor Relations Board. After receiving the notification, the Labor Relations Board will conduct a secret vote among the workers in each factory or mine on the thirtieth day to decide whether to stop working.</p>
<p>The full text of President Roosevelt's arguments on the anti-strike bill and the proposal to advance the conscription age is as follows:</p>
<p>I hereby do not approve of the so-called Wartime Labor Disputes Act and return it. The bill contains many issues and is not a simple bill. The bill has nothing to do with the system of preventing wartime strikes, but instead contains provisions that induce slowdowns and even strikes. I also doubt whether the Senate and House of Representatives have had a full opportunity to review the impact of these provisions on military supply production. According to Article 8 of the bill, when the representatives of employees based on wartime labor contracts pose a significant threat to hindering military supply production, they should report the above disputes to the Wartime Labor Board and the Labor Relations Board. In this way, employees will use a secret vote to indicate whether they believe there is a will to hinder military supply production. However, in the above provisions, although the pledge that leaders of labor organizations must not strike should prevent strikes, it must be notified in advance. As a result, relying on secret votes will instead promote strikes. In wartime, although there will be no prior notification, there cannot be a strike. Article 8 completely ignores the labor world's pledge not to strike and recognizes strike announcements and strike votes. Therefore, those who prevent strikes will instead increase the labor world's unease. Therefore, I am now amending the Selective Service Act, hoping that American people up to the age of sixty-five will have the obligation to engage in military labor other than combat. After this amendment, Americans who induce stoppages or even hinder work in factories under the control of the U.S. government due to strikes and other reasons can be assigned to military labor.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies the Situation of Rice Supply; Distribution Mechanism Transfer Period Temporarily Reduced; Strict Punishment for Stores that Raise Prices without Authorization by Taking Advantage of the Political Situation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced: Due to the recent reorganization of the Shanghai Rice and Edible Oil Distribution Association, despite the various efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the shipment of rice to Shanghai has been slightly delayed. As a result, the distribution quantity of household rice has been temporarily reduced.</p>
<p>Temporary Phenomenon of Household Rice Reduction</p>
<p>The Council expresses its regret for the delay in the distribution of household rice this time and the temporary reduction in the quantity of distribution. However, this situation is entirely due to the temporary unavoidable delay in the arrival of rice in Shanghai after the transfer of the rice distribution mechanism to the Chinese authorities. The Council firmly believes that once the Chinese authorities have completed all necessary preparations, everything will return to normal. We sincerely hope that the citizens will not easily believe the rumors created by unscrupulous merchants. It must be known that the purpose of unscrupulous merchants is to sacrifice the public and only seek private gain.</p>
<p>Strict Measures for Spreading Rumors and Confusing the Public</p>
<p>Recently, illegal merchants have dared to take advantage of this opportunity to create unfounded rumors and wildly raise black market rice prices to enrich themselves. In addition to raising black market rice prices, they also disrupt the economic situation and endanger the peace and order of society. In view of this, the Council has decided to take strict measures against such illegal merchants.</p>
<p>Warning to Stores Not to Raise Prices</p>
<p>In addition, the Council warns general stores not to raise prices privately. Those who take advantage of the recent political situation and raise prices without authorization will be severely punished by the Council. This type of store not only endangers the city but also constitutes a criminal act of disrupting the political and economic situation. Regarding this, the Council will cooperate with the Chinese and Japanese authorities to impose the most severe penalties on unscrupulous merchants. We hope that the citizens can fully understand the importance of this step.</p>
<h3>150,000 Bags of Rice Are Already on Their Way to Shanghai; Rice and Grain Joint Venture Escorts the Shipment to Shanghai; The Shortage of Household Rice Can Be Made Up</h3>
<p>The supply of household rice in this city was slightly reduced in this period due to the transfer of the procurement mechanism. However, the announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office has solemnly stated that the authorities are making every effort to make up for it. According to inquiries from the person in charge of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture, there is absolutely no problem with the distribution of food for the people of this city. The delay in the shipment of rice to Shanghai due to unavoidable reasons is purely a temporary phenomenon. Currently, there are 150,000 bags of rice on their way to Shanghai. The source of this large batch of rice includes 100,000 bags transferred by the Suzhou Rice and Grain Management Office, 30,000 bags transferred by the Huzhou Rice and Grain Warehouse, and 20,000 bags transferred by the Yangzhou Rice and Grain Joint Venture. The company has already sent personnel to the above three places to escort the rice shipment to Shanghai. After the arrival of the above-mentioned rice in Shanghai, the shortage of household rice in this period will be fully made up. At the same time, the Central China Rice Distribution Office still has ample food rice procured and stored in the warehouses. If necessary, the relevant authorities can also find ways to borrow it for relief. Therefore, residents can rest assured and do not need to worry unnecessarily.</p>
<h3>Authorities Take Strict Measures to Crack Down on Illegal Black Markets; Determined to Sanction According to Law to Stabilize the Market</h3>
<p>Commodity prices in this city have recently soared, causing great panic among the general public. The main reason is entirely due to the manipulation of the black market. Creating rumors, agitating people's hearts, and disrupting the market situation, the relevant authorities in the urban area have dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and arrested unscrupulous merchants. It is believed that the rising trend will soon be completely quelled.</p>
<p>Speculation in Gold</p>
<p>Previously, speculation in gold was strictly prohibited by the authorities. Unexpectedly, recently, gold shops and speculators have again taken advantage of the political developments to create rumors and confuse the public, secretly raising prices. Black market gold transactions have risen to exorbitant heights. The listed price of gold ornaments in the gold shops' stores is sold at ×××× per tael according to the limit price and has variably increased the handling fee by ××××× per tael per day. This handling fee has a certain target, which is no different from speculation and disguised price increases.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Since the authorities adopted the household distribution system for food in recent years, the supply of food for the people has been slightly balanced, and people's hearts have been able to stabilize. Unexpectedly, recently rumors have spread, and black market rice prices have risen daily. Yesterday (the 3rd), the rising trend was the most severe. After learning of the incident, the authorities immediately dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and detained rice dealers to be severely punished. The rising trend began to decline in the afternoon. The storage of rice allocated by the authorities in this city is extremely abundant. Recently, the Ministry of Food and the Allied authorities in Shanghai have purchased a large amount of rice from the internal production areas and have been clearing the way for shipment to Shanghai. Therefore, there is absolutely no shortage of food for the people. The rumors are completely unfounded. It is also heard that the allocation of household rice will be restored soon, and there is a proposal to increase the amount of rationed rice per capita. It is learned that the relevant authorities have taken strict measures to crack down on black market transactions and illegal price increases.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Regular Allocation of Artificial Butter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued an announcement that the third phase of artificial butter will be allocated from July 6th to 15th. At that time, the registered retailers will exchange each ticket of the artificial butter certificate No. 3 for one-quarter pound of Parrot or Snow Brand artificial butter, and the selling price is eight yuan plus retail donation.</p>
<h3>Charity Performance for Disaster Relief; Entertainment Tax Exempted; Donations Collected in Round Numbers in the Name of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association is actively planning and assisting in charity performances in various theaters to raise donations. They have also petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to exempt the 30% entertainment tax and allocate it to disaster relief funds. The Shanghai Municipal Council has replied in a letter that after the donations have been collected in round numbers, the donations will be donated to North China in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to this method, the Shanghai Municipal Council will collect the entertainment tax it receives in round numbers and hand it over to the bank designated by the North China Emergency Relief Association to collect donations, which will be used as disaster relief funds. If the amount is insufficient, the Shanghai Municipal Council will make up for it, but the maximum amount is limited to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanxi Fellow Villagers Perform Drama to Raise Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>The disaster in North China is severe this time, and all circles in Shanghai are enthusiastically raising funds to organize emergency relief. The Shanxi Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association is deeply concerned about the disaster in their hometown. To raise disaster relief funds, they will perform a drama to raise funds at the Golden Grand Theater on the afternoon of the 5th of this month. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be donated. Ambassador Li Fang and Ms. Zhao Wenyi, president of the Women's Welfare Association, will personally take the stage. At the same time, Li Shifang and all the artists will perform their lifelong masterpieces. It is believed that those who are kind and generous will be happy to support it.</p>
<h3>Results of the Shen Bao Cup Charity Tournament</h3>
<p>The charity donation for the Shen Bao Cup basketball charity tournament has been generously contributed by all circles. The total income from ticket sales for three days was more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan of Kangyuan Canning Factory generously donated 10,000 yuan, and donations from all circles. We deeply admire his charitable nature. The list of donations received yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai YMCA and Shen Bao jointly organized basketball game ticket sales for three days: 11,300 yuan, Xiang Kangyuan: 10,000 yuan, Wang Jingdong: 2,000 yuan,</p>
<p>Shanghai District Egg Industry Association: 600 yuan, Yao Deyu of Zhongyong Bank, Chen Shichang of Danan Bank, Chen Fumu, United Association of Egg Industry Associations in Various Districts, Shen Liuchun, Chuan Shoupu: 400 yuan each, Fang Jichuan: 200 yuan, Zhi Xiangzhuang: 200 yuan, Liu Jingji: 400 yuan. A total of 27,100 yuan of savings certificates were received. Previous savings of 193,300 yuan. Balance of 220,400 yuan.</p>
<p>(The balance reported yesterday did not include the income reported on the second day, which was a shortage of 1,400 yuan. This is hereby corrected.)</p>
<h3>World Red Swastika Society Continues to Take in Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Center run by the World Red Swastika Society received 38 refugees sent by the French Municipal Council yesterday, and also received the first batch of 53 refugees sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council (including one sent by the Baojia Guidance Department).

<h3>Paper Mill Industry Requests Removal of Electricity Restrictions to Increase Production and Maintain Cultural Development</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paper Industry Association, greatly affected by electricity restrictions on production, has specially submitted a written request to the Baole Department and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, requesting measures to lift the restrictions so that they can maximize production and maintain culture. The written request stated: Although the association has 17 members, most are located in the International Settlement. The production volume of each factory has been severely restricted by the power company due to electricity consumption, reduced to one-half of pre-incident levels, and monthly work is less than a full month. In some cases, electricity is exhausted after only a few days of operation, while the social need for paper is urgent. Upon investigation, the Shanghai Power Company originally rationed electricity due to a lack of fuel. Now, coal sources are smooth and reserves are abundant, so even if full opening is not possible, the minimum requirement should be to facilitate electricity use for factories. If restrictions are imposed across the board without considering urgency, resulting in extreme shortages and skyrocketing black market prices, it would both hinder the authorities' efforts to suppress commodity prices and violate the wartime principle of increasing production, which would be an unwise measure. The association silently considers the crisis of the future of culture and respectfully submits this document, hoping that you will examine it closely and approve its transmission to the Japanese Embassy, ordering the Shanghai Power Company to remove restrictions on electricity use for all paper mills so that they can maximize production, thereby maintaining culture. This would be fortunate for the nation and fortunate for society.</p>

<h3>Strictly Punish Those Who Manipulate Market Prices; Appeal for Enforcement of Orders; Second Special District Party Headquarters Petitions Various Authorities</h3>
<p>The Second Special District Party Headquarters of this city, in view of the prices of goods in recent days, which have caused an unprecedented surge with no end in sight, even doubling daily, not only makes life difficult for citizens but also affects the social economy, which is no small matter. Although the National Government has repeatedly issued clear orders and admonitions, the market has intensified its behavior, ignoring laws and warnings as if they were non-existent, resulting in today's black market. In order to safeguard the people's livelihood and stabilize prices, the headquarters advocates that those who hoard, speculate, and engage in black market activities should be strictly investigated and punished as a warning to others. To this end, it submits a petition to the Central Authorities, requesting the reaffirmation of previous orders and their effective implementation. It also sends separate letters to relevant authorities in the city, requesting that they truly judge those who manipulate market prices and take effective measures to reassure the people and curb the rising trend.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Economy After the Return of the Settlements</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Settlement will cease to exist on August 1st. In the past, the Public Settlement was a base for British and American aggression in China, and free market economics prevailed, forming a distorted state. Now that the settlements have been returned and are directly administered by the National Government, there should be a thorough transformation, striving to improve along the path of building a new China. However, some problems can be pointed out. The most important and obvious is that hoarding behavior has not yet been eliminated, with attempts to use the new agency for material control to seize illegal profits. Although there are many reasons, the complexity of the administrative structure is the main reason. Because of this relationship, it is difficult to impose strong sanctions on all economic crimes, which is deeply regrettable!</p>
<p>This time, the National Government's recovery of the settlements should fundamentally modify the settlement economy and implement adjustments. From now on, Shanghai's economic machinery can be unified, the obstacles in the administrative system can be completely removed, and the unification of control can be realized to achieve a perfect posture. At the same time, Shanghai is the economic heart of China, and all relations are of utmost importance. After the settlement takeover, it is hoped that special care will be taken in the selection of personnel and the operation of institutions responsible for practical work and adjustment.

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Sets Business Guidelines for the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>After completing the final accounts for the first half of the year, the silver and money firms reopened for business yesterday. At the same time, the stock market and various industry markets resumed trading. It is reported that the entire financial sector in Shanghai, under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank, has remained stable throughout. After the firms were adjusted through low-interest loans, their own strength has become more abundant. In order to make every effort to support the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, it has been decided that starting in the second half of the year: (1) Promote the acceptance and discounting of bills. The specific implementation methods have been formulated by the small group of the Banking Association and will be gradually promoted in order to facilitate the funding of legitimate industrial and commercial funds. Commercial bills that have been accepted for discounting can be re-discounted with the Central Reserve Bank. (2) Increase deposit interest rates to absorb excess floating capital in Shanghai society and assist the authorities in suppressing commodity prices and curbing floating capital from wreaking havoc in the black market. (3) Provide loans for small industries and agriculture. All industries that wish to develop production and purchase agricultural products and need funds may apply for loans from various firms, but they must provide documentation to prove the use of the funds, and then the loans will be approved after strict review.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Handles Remittance Business</h3>
<p>Zhejiang and Jiangxi Four Offices Have Opened Central Reserve Bank is taking steps to strengthen inland financial planning and economic development, establishing financial networks nationwide, and setting up branch offices in various locations one after another. To actively regulate inland accounting funds, the "Jiujiang, Nanchang, Shaoxing, Yuyao" and other four offices which opened successively in mid-June this year have exchange business. It is reported that remittances to and from these places have been very popular recently. The address of the Jiujiang office is No. 47 South Road of the Municipal Government, the Nanchang office is on the second floor of the Nanchang Postal Bureau, the Shaoxing office is No. 9 Dama Road, and the Yuyao office is No. 1 Qian Street in the county seat.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks remained firm, and under the mobilization of veteran investors, various stocks rose sharply, with many ending at the highest transaction price. The surge in gold yarn and commodity prices was a major factor in the rise. The Yong'an Company in the department store industry saw the most enthusiastic purchases, with an astonishing increase. Xinxin, Guohuo, and Neiyi companies followed suit, soaring straight up. Jingfu and Jinglun Ershan socks were all traded outside the customs. Yong'an Textile rose most fiercely in the afternoon, breaking through customs again. Dafeng and Rongbian also saw huge increases. Small denomination stocks such as Dachina Weaving and Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing were all progressing. In the public utility industry, Huashang Electricity also exceeded 100 customs, and Zhabei Water and Electricity also reported a steady rise. The increase in Nanyang Tobacco was quite unexpected. Dachina Match also rose sharply. Xinya Pharmaceutical and China-France, Xinyi, and Wuzhou stocks all soared. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press was the most stable. China and World Bookstores were also on the rise. Jiuan Industrial, Tongyi Trust, Defeng Knitting, and Zhongxing Wood Industry were all in a state of demand exceeding supply and rose. Kangyuan Can Manufacturing also broke through another customs point. Weekend trading was quite busy.</p>
<h3>Industry Association Dynamics</h3>
<p>Lard Industry: The lard industry in the city, in view of the fact that the industry includes manufacturing, purchasing, sales, and retail businesses, is in a special situation. With the approval of the Food Bureau, the Shanghai District Lard Industry Association is being organized, and Zhang Zhongming, Xie Jinxing, Zhang Zhongsen, Xie Shoupeng, and Ye Qihua were appointed as preparation members, with Zhang Zhongming as the convener. All lard industry operators, whether or not they have joined other organizations, must register with the association's preparation office at No. 18, Lane 646, Tiantong Road before the 5th of this month, with a deadline for registration.</p>

<h3>Summary of Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The holiday is over, and the yarn market is optimistic, but the volume of goods is not large, and holders are unwilling to sell, so prices are reaching a peak, and transactions are not active. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix has reached a huge 46, 32-count double-strand Xiantao is slightly lower, 20-count Shuangma Bank is at 35, and 10-count Red Shuangma is about to break through.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Today the prices of daily necessities soared. Huorong (matches) were in short supply because the small matches allocated by the Japanese Match Allocation Association to the city have not yet been distributed, causing prices to soar. Soap and candles rely on inventory, and market prices have risen sharply. For example, Guben soap has exceeded the "customs", and Baixiangmao Arrow Knife has also risen high.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: This morning, Unified Government Bonds rose sharply in the gray market, but types B and D were relatively low.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest: This morning, the Call Loan Interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 22%, up 2%.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the price of gold ornaments at local silver shops for new and old peers was still in accordance with the limit price, but with a handling fee. Outside the industry, transactions were not active. The price of silver outside the industry will reach nearly half a hundred.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: This morning, the cloth market was surging. At the beginning of the morning, the demand exceeded the supply, resulting in prices hitting record highs, and the results were consistently higher than before the holiday. Longtou fine cloth rose to 95, and the price of Sijunzi Serge also rose. The current prices of Taohua Nushi Linbu rose more slowly, and the rise in Sanyang Serge and White Cat Printed Cloth was slower. The former was higher by 40, and the latter was higher by several yuan.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric: Sezi Gong Ni, because it cannot be spun from Chinese wool, is becoming increasingly scarce in the market, and prices continue to climb. Recently, it has been found that only one or two out of more than 400 woolen fabric firms have a stock of green Sezi Gong Ni.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Today's Industrial and Commercial Circles</h3>
<p>— Lu Tingfang</p>
<p>Recently, economic scholars generally place their hopes on the government's actions and solutions for various economic problems in China at this stage, such as the lack of resources, the decline in production, the high prices of goods, the stability of currency value, the obstruction of transportation, the use of idle funds, the control of interest rates, the renewal of financial institutions, the elimination of speculative behavior, the establishment of capital markets, and the expansion of the rationing system. This is because wartime economic control requires leadership from the authorities from top to bottom, or the use of legislative means to establish the trajectory of private economic behavior, or the use of administrative means to guide the path of private economic behavior. All of these are originally unchangeable principles, and various countries have implemented them with considerable success.</p>
<p>However, the current situation in our country has a special point that no other country has, namely, the psychological pathology of the industrial and commercial circles. We deeply know that "the government authorities not only have well-thought-out plans for controlling the economy, but are also actively promoting them; and they are also open-mindedly adopting opinions from the private sector, sparing no effort. We have infinite respect for this painstaking effort. However, if we look back at the internal situation of the industrial and commercial circles, we feel a shadow lingering in our minds. Today's industrial and commercial circles are indeed in a state of struggle and exhaustion due to the evolution of the current situation, which is undeniable. However, if we can recognize the current situation, cooperate with the authorities, and actively make changes suitable for the environment, then this state of distress and struggle can be regarded as the darkness before dawn. However, there are still a great number of people in our industrial and commercial circles who linger at the door of liberalism, confused by the "ultimate victory". This kind of pathological psychology has been rooted for a long time, and it is very difficult to eliminate. The result is the rampant prevalence of profiteering, and the use of funds no longer follows legitimate paths; all activities of industrial and commercial operators are no longer based on the premise of the people's livelihood. Therefore, they take various evasive actions towards government control, and lack the enthusiasm for self-motivation in promoting production. Invisibly, they weaken the power of economic construction, and the industrial and commercial prize winners themselves fall into a state of struggle and exhaustion and cannot extricate themselves. Since the existing materials are limited and the production situation is so sluggish, coupled with the fact that everyone wants to make a profit from just one transfer, no matter how strict the authorities' price control is, the rise in prices will inevitably occur. Therefore, turning from side to side, the beneficiaries are indeed the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, and the victims are none other than the industrial and commercial sectors themselves; as a result of rising prices, on the one hand, the relative purchasing power of money is weakened, leading consumers to reduce their consumption due to limited economic capacity, and on the other hand, industrial and commercial enterprises have to sell their goods at a price of one hundred yuan, and they inevitably have to replenish them at a price higher than one hundred yuan. As a result, although they make a profit on the books, the actual goods they retain are reduced. This phenomenon has been deeply loved by informed people, and if it is not remedied, it will inevitably lead to extremely serious consequences. The way to remedy this is to stabilize prices, in addition to the various measures of the authorities. In particular, industrial and commercial self-respect and self-love are required. Those engaged in industry and commerce should know that the current profiteering policy, its profits, should be said to be taken from business, rather than obtained from plunder; even if the wealth obtained from plunder can be secured, the heart is still uneasy. Moreover, will all the adverse consequences it causes still be borne by the business community itself? Since the National Government's participation in the war, all policies have been based on economic construction, and it is gradually improving the current economic situation. This is the time for the industrial and commercial circles to strive for development through normal channels. Can our industrial and commercial people abandon the concept of pursuing excessive profits? And take serving society and regulating the supply and demand of materials as their own responsibility? The self-respect and self-love of the industrial and commercial circles can not only reduce a lot of labor costs for the authorities, but also be the gospel of the social group.</p>
