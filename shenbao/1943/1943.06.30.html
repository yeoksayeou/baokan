<h3 id="c1">上海社會二三事 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近百年來，上海的歷史，在政治上，經濟上，文化上，都曾給全國以重大的影響，所以，上海的一動一靜，可說與全國息息相關的。由於過去上海是列强變相的殖民地，因此，它的本質，和中國文化幷不一致，特別是奢糜風尚的潛發滋長，結果對內地造成不良影響，故最爲有心人士引爲憂戚。現在由於大東亞戰爭，由於日本實施對華新政策，上海租界之交還，即將實現。因此，百年來的上海，已快到改換本質的日子，過去若干優點特點自將保持並發揚之，而一切罪惡的因素，一切不合理的現象，更不能不完全淸除。關於整個的和較重要的問題，暫留待他日討論，今天且先將目前　三不合理的現象，特別提出，希望當局加以注意，如能迅謀改善，尤爲國家社會之福。</p>
<p>第一件矛盾與不合理的現象，是關於物資節的方面的，最重要的是動力，爲了戰時種種需要，節的消耗，實行統制，我們絕對贊成，可是，在統制與節的的過程中，我們看到首先遭受影響的，是一般工廠及其他生產機關，爲了電力供給定有限制，各生產機關的生產力，不能充分發揮，機械，人力，原料等等，都未全部動員，結果（一）是生產品數量减少，構成社會物資不足與物價高漲的因素之一；（二）是人力物力的閒置，多數生產機構不能不裁員，技術人才爲維持生活，另謀出路，人才被糟塌了；（三）同時，大量工人閒置與失業，構成社會不安的因素；（四）因爲生產不能充分發展，原已投放在生產部門的資金，爲免「呆存」起見，乃改變方針，跳出生產部門，進行囤積與投機，這是不當節的而節的。可是，另一方面，每家大飯店大酒樓大舞塲與俱樂部等等，電炬通宵，絃歌達旦者，仍舊比比皆是，而電力之消耗於游戲者，更不可勝計，我們如把這樣消耗的電力統計起來，其數字一定非常驚人。至於電力消耗之外，助長社會不良風習，虛耗人力物力，違反戰時生活，更不待歷數了。這是當節的而不節的。我們今天特別提出，希望當局迅作有力的措施，凡消耗性的用電必須嚴厲限制，凡生產性的電力，應儘量供給。將來成效之佳，必有不可數計者！</p>
<p>第二件値得特別提出的是市民戰時生活不合理現象，一方面是廣大中下層市民生活之痛苦，一切生產份子的小市民與工人，一切國策的執行者與推進者的公務人員與文化工作（包括小學敎師）者，他們眞正的負起了戰爭的重担，受到戰爭所給予的艱苦的生活，而另一方面，一般非生產的，分利的投機份子，則盡情姿慾地作非分的享受，一切奢侈品的市塲，一切豪華的酒樓飯店與娛樂塲所，以及一切上海的「繁榮」，似乎都只是爲了供應這一般非生產者與投機者而存在的。在這種兩極的矛盾現象之下，所謂厲行戰時新國民生活，便完全失去了意義。而且，由於這種矛盾現象之存在，無形中刺激和鼓勵一般國民投機舞弊與冒險徼倖的心理，因爲只要投機與舞弊，就有擺脫苦難的生活而可以盡情享受。即不幸失敗，亦不過回復到吃不飽餓不死的現生活！這是何等嚴重的現象，我們希望當局迅謀適當的對策，取締一切奢侈豪華違反戰時體制的生活與行動，消除這種矛盾與不合理現象，務求達到「公平」的理想。同時更盼望社會上的領袖份子，自行檢查，厲行節的，本報於六月五日倡議「節省宴會公的」，一時工商領袖，羣起響應，並補充意見，大有蔚成一時風起之趨勢，甚望各領袖於身體力行之外，更廣爲宣傳推行，務求遍普，庶使人人以奢侈的生活爲可恥，則今後上海或可一變往日的面目而爲全國新生的模範。</p>
<p>第三件是本市各街道流浪兒童之充塞，最令人痛心。因爲大家知道，兒童是國家的命脈，要知未來國家之氣運，須視今日兒童之敎養如何。目前全國因受戰爭影響，一般中等以下的家庭，已有不能負擔其子弟敎育費之趨勢，富家子弟，則又習於嬉游，無心向學，最可哀者，是一般受戰爭影響而破家者的子弟們，衣食無着，遑言敎育，於是流浪街頭，上焉者一籃一鉗，徘徊里弄，拾荒檢遺，聊補家用；下焉者則流爲童丐，轉輾以死，其中較聰明與强悍者，則或作小偸，或刦婦孺，結黨成羣，作奸犯科，勉渡歲月。無論何種，皆爲國家元氣之消耗，且造成社會不安之因素。工部局向有兒童保障科之設，各善團似亦有收容敎餐之機關，但或限於法例，或絀於經費，對於社會上廣大之流浪兒，大有「安得廣厦千萬間」之憾。最近世界紅卍字會經辦上海流民習勤所，收容流民乞丐，誠爲一大善舉，但我們認爲流浪兒童之有待於收容敎養，實更急於成年流民，而在政治與社會意義上尤爲重要。我們竭誠盼望關係方面加以注意，迅籌收容敎養，爲國家多保留幾分元氣，也就是多替社會消除幾分危機，不僅爲壯觀瞻的小問題而已。</p>
<p>上海仍是全國視聽集中之所，當此本質的轉變即將開始之際，我們將就其輕者易者先求各方面注意與改善，爲本市新生的前奏，爲全國新生的模範。否則，輕而易舉者且辦不到，遑言重者大者了。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日大本營昨午發表　陸海軍航空隊戰果　大舉轟炸達爾文及新幾內亞　墜毀並擊傷敵機達四十餘架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營二十九日十二時發表：（甲）帝國陸軍航空部隊，曾於六月二十日及二十二日攻擊澳洲西北部之敵空軍基地達爾文港，其經過情况如次：（一）六月二十日與敵戰鬥機四十餘架交戰，除擊落其二十七架及炸毀地上三架外，並炸碎敵兵營數座及其飛機塲設施，數處發生六火，我方損失爲自炸三架。（二）六月二十二日，再度以戰鬥機隊進攻該地，敵機與敵防空砲火均掩息未戰，我機全數平安飛回。（乙）帝國陸軍航空部隊曾於六月二十日及二十一日攻擊新幾內亞島瓦屋附近之敵飛機塲，收獲戰果如次：（一）六月二十日，在瓦屋炸傷地上敵機三架，我方無損失。（二）六月二十一日，在薩拉摩亞附近上空與敵機二十餘架發生遭遇戰，曾擊落其八架，擊傷其三架，我方一架尚未飛回。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十九日中央社電　據新金山雷：西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發表：日空軍會於二十八日大舉轟炸達爾文港。</p>
<p>日對太平洋方面完成新作戰態勢</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　本年二月太平洋方面日軍爲推行新戰略，即開始籌備新作戰態勢，今已告完成。日陸軍航空部隊連日呼應海軍航空部隊空襲達爾文港，茲錄具於戰時上之意義如次：（一）日軍戰略要點及重要戰綫之整備已全部完成。　日陸軍航空部隊已以達爾文港爲直接轟炸目標。（三）該方面戰局，因此次轟炸即入於新的階段。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　南太平洋之空戰，現已日益激烈，日陸軍機與海軍機相呼應下，近曾二次大舉空襲澳洲西北端之敵方最大基地達爾文港，予以重創，加深敵陣之威脅。蓋日陸軍機爲澈底覆滅澳洲敵前綫基地達爾文港，乃於六月二十日以戰鬥轟炸機聯合大編隊往襲該港，日機到達之時，爲十時二十分，敵噴火式戰鬥機四十餘架當亦飛起迎戰，達爾文港上空遂展開一大空戰，交戰不久，日機即擊落敵機二十七架。另一方面日轟炸機則對敵兵營地帶猛施轟炸，使之發生大火，該港東部之飛機塲，貯藏庫等設施，亦完全被炸燬，是役敵方損失實大。二十二日，日陸軍機再度以戰鬥機大編隊進攻達爾文港之時，則未見敵機一架起飛應戰，地上砲火亦完全無聲，敵方戰勢之弱，於此可知。最近達爾文港所有之敵機數約爲六七十架，但二十二日竟未有一架應戰，故達爾文港此次受創之重，當可推知，又日陸軍機於二十日空襲澳洲後，歸途中曾於新幾內亞之瓦屋飛機場發現敵雙發轟炸機三架，當予擊傷。二十一日進攻敵基地之途中，復在薩拉摩亞上空與敵戰鬥機二十餘架遭遇，交戰結果，除擊落八架外，並擊傷共三架，餘者逃去。日軍於南太平洋方面，由於瓜達康納爾援護部隊之奮戰，優異戰略態勢已告確立，茲復由於日陸，海航空部隊之聯絡轟炸敵基地，破壞敵方增援路及攻擊敵空軍基地，故已將敵空軍完全壓倒。南太平洋之航空決戰，實可決定此後戰局之演進，鑑於日國內飛機生產之近益增加，可知此舫空決戰今後更將有利日本而展開。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：據倫敦來訊，英唐寗街官員與外報訪員之　　中，暗示現已擇定七月三日爲反軸心侵犯歐洲之日期，此事之可靠與否，固不得而知，惟瑞典京城方面確由三個不同來源，獲得此項傳說至低限度可表示其係得英情報部之許可始能發表。衆料此種傳說之宣傳，對於英國民衆將有甚大之心理上效果，因英民衆對於六月二十二日未見發動此項侵犯及星期六傳來消息謂，斯達林現又提出英。美是否願實行此項侵犯之質間，顯感失望也。據可恃方面消息，所有蘇聯駐英。美之外交家，均已於星期五奉到訓令，命彼等利用一切可能性，催促斯達林所提侵犯要求之實現，同時，英·美駐莫斯科之各訪員亦經蘇情報局懇切要求，請彼等於所發電訊中鄭重申明蘇聯人民之意見，認爲侵犯歐洲之舉，一九四二年時已蒙允諾，故堅持須在今後數日內發動。莫斯科之新行動，究將影響英。美之軍員計劃至如何程度，雖尚不得而知，但有事頗爲明顯者，即目前倫敦所提及七月三日之侵歐之期，必可使不耐久之蘇聯爲之稍安勿躁也。</p>
<p>羅馬討論進攻途徑</p>
<p>羅馬二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心擬在歐洲何處登陸之問題，已成此間人士紛紛討論之題材，就一般之軍略上局勢而論，反軸心不論擬在何處登陸之前，至少限度必須將西西里予以佔領。此間人士認爲：在理論上，反軸心軍隊頗有假道西班牙或士耳其之可能，惟此舉不啻公開破壞該兩國所努力維持之中立，倘使以上兩項可能性因此而不能成立，則進攻歐洲尚有三海可循，即法國南部，巴爾幹與義大利本土是也。反軸心雖或能在法國地中海沿岸登陸成功，但登陸之軍隊及給養，必須經過長程海道之運輸，亦殊不容忽視，且登陸用之特殊船隻，均屬噸位甚小，不能在二十四小時之內，由北非根據地橫越海岸，中途更須防軸心海空軍之襲擊。是以即使反軸心軍能登陸成功，其交通綫亦將不斷感受威脅，諸如登陸地距離軸心各國之本土尚甚遙遠與沿途必須克服軸心軍之抵抗，更無論矣。反軸心國爲儘量消除空中威脅起見，必須先佔有撒丁與科西嘉，始克有濟，關於取道巴爾幹之進攻，則不但有長稈海上交通綫之困難，且需要佔領所有愛琴海各島，蓋不如此，萬難獲得成功也。反軸心所有之援軍與給養，將需由地中海運輸，因繞道非洲未免過遠，爲謀此項運輸之安全計，西西里佔據將成必要。反軸心軍隊欲在巴爾幹獲得有組織游擊隊之協助與取得羅馬尼亞油田之希望，均極微弱，且該處地勢艱險，軸心軍得由各方面進攻，故應付此項困難，自屬較易，羅馬方面認反軸心之攻取西西里，將極合邏輯，否則甚難有成功之望，此間人十皆信英·美似將照此而行。</p>

<p>鶴見氏談往事經過</p>
<p>日衆院議員　見祐輔氏之於十九年前美國實施此暴戾之排日移民法時，曾渡美闡明日本之正義，今爲使世人明瞭當時日本國民之憤慨情形及美國之蠻橫無理，特談其經過如次，大正十三年，民國卞三年七月一日，美國實施之所謂排日移民法、乃美國對來百世界各國移民所設立不合理法律，其用意即在排斥英人，以之移民當時規定日本移入限在百人以內，然此後於修正該法時，竟向國會提出全部嚴禁日本移民之說，日本對此，曾向美國提出抗議，蓋此種差別待遇，實非日本所能忍受者，但因美國加里佛尼亞州等之無道政治家以虛偽宣傳，惡罵日本之結果，此差別待遇乃終於國會通過。距十七年前日，美兩國曾締結所調紳士協定，且政府根據此項協定，自動限制向美移民，且從而遵守之，然美國則不顧此十七年前之信義，毫無任何理由，而僅禁止日本人入國：是時，日政府曾命駐美大使　原正直警告美國，倘通過此法索時，將發生「重大之結果」，然因美國煽惑政治家之宣傳，該移民法第十二條，終在議會通過，該法內雖未嘗明爲日本人，但謂「憲法上不能歸化之外國人禁止入國」，蓋其憲法即規定「東洋人不得歸化爲美國人」。因印度人。中國人在此以前即已禁止入國，故此條文實顯指日本人而言，吾人謂此爲排日移民法者，亦即爲此，自是日以後，日本工人即未有一人能得進入美國，故日本人民無不憤怒異當。</p>
<p>渡美演講達百餘次</p>
<p>在此以前，日本對於美國從無任何不當措置。但美國所加於日本者，則係此種無理之差別待遇、因之余曾連接美國卅七大學之電報，請余速赴美講演，以闡明日本人對此移民法之觀感，余渡美一年半，其間陳述此問題者，港百五十次之多。猶憶當時余曾謂。過去日，美之間並未發生任何有碍國交之事件，爲通商貿易以及交換文化均屬親善之舉，然因談移民法之實施，遂在日、美之規善歷史上發生一大製痕，若美國不早日修正此項法律，則余敢據言將來必將引起嚴重之結果。謂實施此項移民法之根本理由既非因爲經濟問題。亦非因爲文化及法律問題，顯在排擊日本人，實爲一人種問題。此實起於美人之人種優越惑，而彼等所謂之正義人道及自由平等，實爲一假面具。吾人試觀美國國內，則知彼等對於其他有色人種極盡壓迫之能事，美國之對待黑人，即爲一好例，彼等實受黑人之恩，而竟數典志祖，恩將仇報，加州今日之繁榮爲誰之賜，設無日本農民焉有今日，然美國不准日僑具有土地所有權，僅予以三年之短期租借權，迨三年後，荒蕪之土地成爲樂國，當即收囘。小學校中日藉之優秀兒童，不但任級長，日本靑年雖畢業於美國大學，亦不爲美國公司商行所錄用，日僑能與美人結婚，加州之美人竟不擇手段，用一切方法迫使美國採取此種極不人道之行爲。但一至中國，即高唱正義人道，對日本政府一一加以排擊，此實爲美國自己引起此次大東亞戰爭之導火綫，是以眞正排擊亞洲人移民法之惟一途徑，不外爲大東亞戰爭之勝利，唯有吾人完遂戰爭，而能使彼等放棄其人種之優越感，盎格魯撒克遜唯我獨尊之優越感，實爲妨害人類平等自由之幸福，故其優越感被粉碎之日，即新世界歷史展開第一頁之時。</p>

<p>日本朝日新聞社莫斯科特派員烟中氏於本年六月一日特電總社，報告俄京近況，其中關於俄京市民開　市地爲農園熱部份，　之不禁令人發生無限感慨。報告中有這樣一段。「聞記者在莫斯科的滯留中，不僅未聞一次空龔警報，簡直」不覺得有直接威脅市民和平生活的戰爭存在着……前年通到莫斯科的門道路，密佈着戰車壕及堡疊，防衛首都，……可是今日舊地重遊，那時的戰車壕及堡疊全變成了市民的農園。……現在莫斯科的市民正在把從郊外通至市中的道路及市街，分開爲農園土地，從事耕作。……關於園藝著作的單行本和小冊子，在書店前列隊爭購的不知有多少人，市內到處可見的市民農園，大小合計，據說數目在三萬三千二百四十九所以上，像果里甚街那樣觸目的高層建築物的四周，都已　成農園，……因爲市民在過去三個冬季中，苦於野菜的缺乏，故開始這種活動，以求自給自足。」</p>
<p>俄京人民受過血的洗禮以後，已經開始從事於市地農圃，以期補救糧食恐慌於萬一。若以俄京園圃增產熱情形與上海投機浪費熱情形相對比，真令人慚愧得很。俄京市民列隊爭購園藝著作的單行本和小冊子，而上海市民却在列隊爭購各種配給香烟，試問香烟能夠生產什麼？俄京市民農園大小多至三萬三四千處，試問上海市民的家園農圃有幾處呢？希望上海市民，尤其家有廣大花軒的市民，反躬自問一下，同時希望地方當局訓戒警察或巡捕不得妨阻私家花園之改爲園圃，因爲這是補救糧食的一個辦法。</p>

<p>— 吳民</p>
<p>曾經有人譏　過我們　說我們是只有五分鐘熱度的民族。在一件事情幹起頭的時候，大家都起勁得不得了，遇到稍有一些磨折或敗退，覺得這事並不是容易幹，興味就差了，慢慢地就把這事情消沉下去，或者是一個人也沒有苒提起它了，這些都是實話，並沒有說得過份，這年頭，尤其是如此。例如把一件事情鬧大了，大家都覺得義憤填膺，非把這一件事幹得好不可，可是隔了些時候，見着並沒有甚麽收效，或者長有一些成績了，大家不問也不聞，好像已把這一件事已幹完了。實際呢？還不是如此，不過多了些人參加在這事情裏面，究寬怎樣後來當然也不知道了，大概日子多了，事情就不覺得是嚴重了，決沒有人再去追究這過去了的事，又某人聽說他在幹些甚麼，幹些甚麼，能者多勞，幹了這件，又幹了那一件。這件事他也在幹，那一件事他也在幹，問他一件事有能力將它幹好幹完嗎？這倒也未必，可是他已着手在幹另一件新的了，問他新的事把握有嗎？也十分難說，幹起頭是很高興的，幹了些時候，覺得這並不好幹，或者有了些成績就感到滿意，，再也沒有興趣，就去幹別的了。別的也是如此。他又覺得不好幹，或覺得有了些成績就感到滿足，又覺得再也沒有興趣了，他又去找尋新的事去幹了。他每件事都是這樣，有始無終，半途而廢，存僥倖心，結果是他事事都在幹，可是一件事也沒有把它幹好。</p>
<p>這些都是患上了不澈底的毛病，像一個人覺得這裏有病痛了。就去醫治這裏，那面覺得有病痛了，就去醫治那面，可是它忘記了這裏的病還沒有全愈，顧到那面新的病雖是要緊的，但同時不要忘記將要醫治完了的舊病復發起來，怎樣有效的計劃把這裏醫好？再着手　面新生起的病。或者是爲了醫新的要緊，同時也不要將舊病忘了醫治。使功虧一簣。新的沒有好，舊的更厲害了。</p>

<p>這表示不什麽呢？事實很明顯，兒童是在迅速的進步着：敎師呢，故步自封，停留着不向前進，這種矛盾發展到極點：就表現出像上面所學的怪現象。</p>
<p>這自然是一種病態——一種不健全的怪現象、主要的是：敎師工作太忙，待遇太苦而致影饗到敎師的情緒和進修，因此，一個敎師如果要獲得兒童的敬仰和愛護，並且能給予兒童合乎時代的敎育，對於自身的進修，實在是十二分必要的、</p>
<p>一年容易，冗長的暑期將到。小敎同人們宜利用這假期作有益的選修、本年度申報社本一　社會服務的精神，籌備在暑期裏舉辦小學敎師暑期進修會，是委託上海女靑年會代辦的，這樣一個進修會的開辦，實在是小敎仝人值得欣慰的消息。</p>
<p>進修會最主要的自然是有關小學敎育方面進修的課程此項課程計共開設七課。（一）小學行政實際問題，（二）小學敎材及敎法，（三）教育及兒童心理學，（四）學校兒實心理衛生，（五）義務敎育問題，（六）小學訓育問題，（七）敎育原理所聘敎師都是滬上各大學名敎授及教育專家除課程外每星期有名人講演及參觀座談等，再爲教師娛樂身心起見，　有運動（羽毛球網球及游泳）歌詠話劇並籌備健康檢查等。</p>
<p>進修會的地址　是設在同孚路大沽路上海女中，這是一所寬大而合乎校舍理想的所在。</p>

<p>— 企洛</p>
<p>「自罪」從好的方面解釋，可以使我們反省自身的錯誤，洞悉自己的缺陷，激勵自己，事事抱着尊敬他人，學習他人長處的態度去進行。如此，則事事求進步，得益無窮。反之，另一種過度的「自罪」，竟無異是自卑，凡事以爲自己無力勝任便不去做。漸漸造成怕懼「人生」，逃避現實，事事懦怯退縮的趨勢。以爲自己的一舉一動都是犯罪的行動，連白天在街上行走都不敢正眼瞧人家一眼，似乎旁人正向他投射着鄙視的一瞥、因此他一天到晚就沒一刻安甯。這是多麼可憐又可怕的「人生」啊！</p>
<p>不用說，找們所需要的「自罪」，當然是前面的一種了。</p>
<p>有人說：「世昇上的人往往祇能看見人家的錯處，而極不容易發現自身的缺點」。這句話就是說：「我們祇會罪人。却不能自罪」。實際上罪人並不是絕對不良的。如果我們能夠貢獻極實貴的意見，同時抱着相當友誼的態度　「規勁」的方式去罪人，那麼也未嘗不是一件美好的事情。可是，在這社會裏多的是「吹毛求疵」式的去罪人。</p>
<p>假使我們能把罪人的時間，移一部份花在自罪上。那麽，我相信於自身，於家庭，於社會……一定有莫大的幫助。</p>
<p>電影漫談</p>
<h3 id="c50">國片的取材路綫 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 趙訥</p>
<p>國　影片的產量，在近年中是最盛的時期，因爲產量的增加，取材方面就零亂起來，假使把它的綫路歸併一下，十分之七八屬於男女戀愛的愛情故事，能夠談得上敎育與文藝的佔不到十分之一二。原因是愛情影片在營業上容易有收獲，而取材方面也方便，敎育影片不是取材困難，流於「刻板化」的教科書，便是營業上受到失敗的打擊，在這種情形之下，大家便捨本逐未，儘量使影片如何能模倣好萊塲的戀愛喜劇，或者文藝性的大悲劇，電影也由教育工具變爲戀愛教科書了。</p>
<p>假使拿「良宵花弄月」和「浮雲掩月」兩個戲來對比一下，他們取材的路綫是相同的，大家都有些愛美國電影的作風，同樣是把一個戀愛故事成爲趣劇化，可是，「良宵花弄月」的成就似乎較「浮雲掩月」來得高。因爲它已加進了一個問題。這問題是屬於社會方面的，比之「浮雲掩月」中的女書記與經理的那個問題重得多，而在我國社會中也適合得多，這裏證明在同一路綫中長成的作品，還得由培植者加上滋養的肥料。</p>
<p>其次，近年來國片的取材，儘量在所謂上層社會的黑暗處落筆，在高樓大厦發生罪惡事情固然很多，脫不了經理一少女，金錢的誘……等一新故事，千篇一律，這種「上層社會」的黑暗知離聞一般小市民還很遠，要如道，化大錢看戲的人們，是百分之百的娛樂，而在三四流戲院看戲的，在娛樂之外，還可以增進他們的智識。所謂下層社會的陰暗面，較之「上層」，當然更慘酷與痛苦，他們希望給每個人知道，但類於這種情形的影片今日是少見，過去有「馬路天使」，「城市之夜」等，在電影藝術上獲得空前的價値，現在的製片者也能注意到這一點，同樣有無數觀衆是歡迎的，最好的題材莫如「張金海案件」，寄生在社會陰暗面的地痞流氓，如何欺詐壓迫，雖不要根據這個故事，但却是個取材的好路綫。</p>
<p>看過「母親」，大家都覺得它是一個優良的題材。而「四姊妹」與「三朶花」的主題也不錯，而看來鱟得較「母親」差得遠，原因是後者把主綫移向於另一面，份量立刻减輕，這個製作者應注意的地方，等於演「阿Q正傳」而儘量使之觀衆發笑的情景。</p>
<p>希望以後國產影片取材的路綫，能够廣泛一些，在每條路綫上，永遠不能忘懷那根「敎育的工具」做主幹。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Miscellaneous Shanghai Society Matters <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In the past hundred years, Shanghai's history has exerted a significant impact on the entire country in terms of politics, economy, and culture. Therefore, Shanghai's every move and stillness can be said to be closely related to the whole country. In the past, Shanghai was a disguised colony of the great powers. Therefore, its essence was inconsistent with Chinese culture, especially the hidden growth of extravagant customs, which resulted in a negative impact on the inland, causing concern among those who care. Now, due to the Greater East Asia War and Japan's implementation of a new policy toward China, the return of Shanghai's concessions is about to be realized. Therefore, Shanghai, which has existed for a hundred years, is approaching a time of changing its essence. Some of the advantages and characteristics of the past will be maintained and developed, while all evil factors and unreasonable phenomena must be completely eliminated. Regarding the overall and more important issues, we will leave them for discussion on another day. Today, we will first present three current unreasonable phenomena and hope that the authorities will pay attention to them. If improvements can be made quickly, it will be a blessing for the country and society.</p>
<p>The first contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon concerns the aspect of conserving resources. The most important thing is power. For various wartime needs, the conservation and consumption of resources are subject to control. We absolutely agree with this. However, in the process of control and conservation, we see that the first to be affected are general factories and other production organizations. Due to the limited supply of electricity, the productivity of various production organizations cannot be fully utilized. Machinery, manpower, raw materials, etc., are not fully mobilized. As a result: (1) the quantity of products is reduced, contributing to the shortage of social materials and rising prices; (2) manpower and resources are idle. Most production organizations have to lay off employees. Technical talents seek other ways to maintain their livelihoods, and talents are wasted; (3) at the same time, a large number of workers are idle and unemployed, creating factors of social unrest; (4) because production cannot be fully developed, the funds already invested in the production sector, in order to avoid being "idle", change their direction, jump out of the production sector, and engage in hoarding and speculation. This is conserving where it should not be conserved. However, on the other hand, in every large hotel, restaurant, dance hall, and club, etc., electric lights are on all night, and singing and music continue until dawn. There are still many such places, and the electricity consumed for entertainment is countless. If we were to calculate the amount of electricity consumed in this way, the figure would be staggering. In addition to the consumption of electricity, it encourages bad social habits, wastes manpower and resources, and violates wartime life, not to mention other consequences. This is not conserving where it should be conserved. Today, we specifically bring this up, hoping that the authorities will take effective measures as soon as possible. All consumption of electricity should be strictly limited, and electricity for production should be supplied as much as possible. In the future, the benefits will be immeasurable!</p>
<p>The second thing that deserves special attention is the unreasonable phenomenon of wartime life for citizens. On the one hand, there is the suffering of the vast middle and lower classes of citizens. The small citizens and workers who are all production participants, the public officials and cultural workers (including elementary school teachers) who are all executors and promoters of national policies, they are truly bearing the heavy burden of the war and suffering the difficult life brought about by the war. On the other hand, the general non-productive, profit-sharing speculators indulge in extravagant enjoyment. All the markets for luxury goods, all the luxurious restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, and all the "prosperity" of Shanghai seem to exist only to supply these non-producers and speculators. Under this extremely contradictory phenomenon, the so-called vigorously implementing a new wartime national life completely loses its meaning. Moreover, due to the existence of this contradictory phenomenon, it invisibly stimulates and encourages the general public's psychology of speculation, fraud, and taking risks, because as long as there is speculation and fraud, one can escape the life of hardship and enjoy oneself to the fullest. Even if one unfortunately fails, one will only return to the present life of being neither full nor starving! This is such a serious phenomenon. We hope that the authorities will quickly devise appropriate countermeasures, ban all luxurious and extravagant lifestyles and actions that violate the wartime system, eliminate this contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon, and strive to achieve the ideal of "fairness." At the same time, we also hope that the leaders of society will conduct self-examination and vigorously practice thrift. This newspaper advocated for "saving on public banquets" on June 5th, and for a time, business leaders responded enthusiastically and added opinions, creating a trend that had the potential to become a prevailing fashion. It is hoped that all leaders, in addition to personally practicing it, will also widely promote and implement it, striving to make it universal, so that everyone will regard extravagance as shameful. Then Shanghai may be able to change its past face and become a model for the new life of the whole country.</p>
<p>The third issue is the pervasive presence of homeless children in the city's streets, which is most heartbreaking. Because as everyone knows, children are the lifeblood of the country. To know the future destiny of the country, one must look at how children are educated today. At present, due to the impact of the war, general middle- and lower-class families are already unable to afford the education expenses of their children. The children of wealthy families are accustomed to playing and have no interest in learning. The most pitiful are the children of those who have lost their families due to the impact of the war. They have no food or clothing, let alone education. So they wander the streets. The better ones wander through the alleys with a basket and tongs, picking up scraps and leftovers to supplement the household income. The worse ones become child beggars, perishing through starvation. Those who are smarter and stronger may become petty thieves or rob women and children, forming gangs and committing crimes to survive. Regardless of which type, they are all consuming the nation's vitality and creating factors of social unrest. The Municipal Council has a Children's Protection Section, and various charitable organizations seem to have institutions for receiving and teaching children, but they are either limited by laws or lack funds, and they have the regret of "how can we obtain tens of millions of spacious houses" for the vast number of homeless children in society. Recently, the World Red Swastika Society has established a Shanghai Civilian Training Center to take in displaced people and beggars, which is truly a great act of charity. However, we believe that the need to take in and educate homeless children is more urgent than that of adult displaced people, and it is especially important in terms of political and social significance. We sincerely hope that the relevant parties will pay attention to this and quickly plan to take in and educate them, to preserve a few more points of vitality for the country, which is also to eliminate a few more points of crisis for society, and it is not just a small problem of outward appearance.</p>
<p>Shanghai is still the place where the nation's attention is focused. As this fundamental transformation is about to begin, we will first seek the attention and improvement of all parties regarding the lighter and easier matters, as a prelude to the new life of the city and a model for the new life of the nation. Otherwise, if the light and easy matters cannot be handled, how can we talk about the heavy and big ones?</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon The War Results of the Army and Navy Air Forces Heavily Bombed Darwin and New Guinea More Than 40 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down and Damaged <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 29th: (A) The Imperial Army Air Force attacked Darwin Port, the enemy air force base in northwestern Australia, on June 20th and 22nd. The situation is as follows: (1) On June 20th, it engaged more than 40 enemy fighter planes, shot down 27 of them, destroyed 3 on the ground, and shattered several enemy barracks and airfield facilities. Six fires broke out in several places. Our losses were three self-detonations. (2) On June 22nd, the fighter squadron attacked the area again. The enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire were silent and did not fight. All our planes returned safely. (B) The Imperial Army Air Force attacked the enemy airfield near Lae, New Guinea Island, on June 20th and 21st, with the following results: (1) On June 20th, three enemy planes were damaged on the ground in Lae, with no losses on our side. (2) On June 21st, an encounter battle occurred with more than 20 enemy planes in the airspace near Salamaua, and eight of them were shot down and three were damaged. One of our planes has not yet returned.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to New Golden Mountain Telegram: The Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Military Headquarters announced that the Japanese Air Force heavily bombed Darwin Port on the 28th.</p>
<p>Japan Completes New Operational Posture in the Pacific</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - In February of this year, the Japanese army in the Pacific began to prepare a new operational posture in order to promote a new strategy, which has now been completed. The Japanese Army Air Force has been echoing the Navy Air Force in air raids on Darwin Port for days. The significance in wartime is as follows: (1) The preparation of strategic points and important frontlines of the Japanese army has been fully completed. (2) The Japanese Army Air Force has directly bombed Darwin Port. (3) The war situation in that area has entered a new stage due to this bombing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The air battle in the South Pacific is now becoming increasingly fierce. With the Japanese Army and Navy aircraft echoing each other, they recently launched two major air raids on Darwin Port, the enemy's largest base in northwestern Australia, inflicting heavy damage and deepening the threat to the enemy's position. In order to completely destroy Darwin Port, the enemy's frontline base in Australia, the Japanese Army aircraft attacked the port on June 20th with a combined large formation of fighter-bombers. The Japanese aircraft arrived at 10:20 am. More than 40 enemy Spitfire fighter planes also took off to meet the battle. A major air battle then unfolded over Darwin Port. Soon after the engagement, the Japanese aircraft shot down 27 enemy aircraft. On the other hand, the Japanese bombers launched a fierce bombing of the enemy barracks area, causing a large fire. The airfield and storage facilities in the eastern part of the port were also completely destroyed by the bombing. The enemy's losses in this battle were really great. On the 22nd, when the Japanese Army aircraft attacked Darwin Port again with a large formation of fighters, not a single enemy aircraft was seen taking off to respond, and the ground artillery was also completely silent. The weakness of the enemy's war situation can be seen from this. Recently, the number of enemy aircraft in Darwin Port was about 60 to 70, but not a single one responded on the 22nd. Therefore, it can be inferred that Darwin Port suffered heavy damage this time. In addition, on the way back after the Japanese Army aircraft raided Australia on the 20th, they discovered three enemy twin-engine bombers at the Wau airport in New Guinea and damaged them. On the 21st, on the way to attack the enemy base, they encountered more than 20 enemy fighter planes in the airspace over Salamaua. As a result of the battle, in addition to shooting down eight, they also damaged a total of three, and the rest escaped. In the South Pacific, due to the hard work of the Guadalcanal support troops, an excellent strategic situation has been established. Now, due to the joint bombing of enemy bases by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces, destroying the enemy's reinforcement route and attacking the enemy air force base, the enemy air force has been completely overwhelmed. The air decisive battle in the South Pacific can determine the future evolution of the war situation. In view of the recent increase in aircraft production in Japan, it can be known that this air decisive battle will be more favorable to Japan in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e3">A Large Number of Enemy Properties in Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong Transferred by the Japanese Side to Our Country for Management A Total of 461 Items <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan entered a stage of shared life and death. In order to assist the friendly country of China in its war effort and cooperative development, and based on its consistent policy, the friendly country is practicing its statement of respecting China's sovereignty by transferring enemy properties in various places. On February 8th of this year, more than 1,000 enemy properties in Central and North China were transferred.

<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the friendly country of Japan has repeatedly decided to transfer the enemy properties of the British and American enemy countries to the National Government of China for management in order to respect China's sovereignty and territory.

<h3 id="e4">Minister Chu's Speech <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly country of Japan has seized and dealt with the property of the enemy countries and enemy legal entities in our country, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. After our country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, the friendly country of Japan, based on the principle of respecting our country's sovereignty and cooperating in completing the war, made a special statement to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. On February 8th of this year, the enemy properties that had been sorted out and scattered in various parts of Central and North China, totaling more than 1,000 items, were formally transferred to the National Government for management. Today, the 461 enemy properties in Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong that have been investigated and completed are formally transferred to the National Government for management for the second time. We are deeply grateful for the repeated good intentions of the friendly country of Japan. Among the enemy properties transferred to the National Government for management for the second time, such as the Hankou Electric Light Company, Peace Yanghang, Longmao Yanghang, Huachang University, Boxue Middle School, Puai Hospital, Yongfu Company of Xiamen. Hefeng Co., Ltd. Baoci Hospital, Sincere Company of Guangdong, Bunnemun Warehouse, Lingnan University and Farm, Mimei Hospital, etc., are all important British and American enterprises and cultural facilities in the Far East. After our country takes over, it will handle them properly and operate them well, in order to help our country's industrial revitalization and the development of education and culture, and further cooperate in completing the Greater Laiya War.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Speech by the Authorities of the Japanese Embassy <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations, and from the standpoint of respecting China's sovereignty and territory, the Imperial Government has decided on the policy of returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. At the time when the National Government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, it made necessary consultations and decided to implement them. Regarding the enemy properties seized by the Japanese military, it was also decided to transfer them to the National Government for management based on the same point of view. On February 8th, more than 1,000 enemy properties in the Central China region (excluding Hankou) and the North China region that had been investigated for the first time were notified of the completion of the transfer, and preparations were made for the implementation of the transfer at the same time as the notification. A total of 771 items, 110 in the Central China region and 661 in the North China region, which is three-quarters of the total enemy property, have been transferred. The remaining one-quarter is also being prepared and is scheduled to be implemented in the near future. On the other hand, the authorities concerned are also investigating the Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong regions. Except for some parts that have not been clarified, the investigation has been completed in general, and we are very pleased to be able to make a second transfer announcement today. These enemy properties include one or two items in the Hankou area, one or two items in the Xiamen area, and two or two items in the Guangdong area, for a total of 461 items. Other items include the Hankou Electric Light Company, Peace Yanghang, Longmao Yanghang, the residence managed by Peace Yanghang, Huachang University, Boxue Middle School, Puai Hospital, etc., Yongfu Company in Xiamen, Peace Co., Ltd., Xiamen Club, Baoci Hospital, Sincere Company in Guangdong, International Friendship Society, Bunnemun Warehouse, Lingnan University and the university's farm, Mimei Church Hospital, etc., including the important British and American enterprises and cultural facilities in China in the past. With the transfer and return of these enemy properties, the National Government will be able to use them to counter the long-term economic and cultural aggression of the United Kingdom and the United States, and will surely actively cooperate in the common completion of the Greater East Asia War. We always believe in this without any doubt.</p>

The aircraft is towed with ropes, and high-speed pulling can ascend to three or four hundred meters, which is an initial tool for young people to learn aviation. It has a great contribution to the development of aviation in our country. The donation ceremony of the glider was held at 10:30 am yesterday (29th) at the Ming Palace Airport.

After the aircraft sailed to a high altitude, it detached from the ropes and performed various flying performances such as circling, straight flying, and reverse flying, continuing for more than ten minutes. It was exceptionally wonderful, and the audience gave enthusiastic applause. After the flight performance, the presentation ceremony ended at about 12 o'clock in a state of great excitement.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Minister Zhou Calls Meeting in Hankou for Lectures to Tax Personnel in Three Provinces <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 29th (Central News Agency) - The 29th was the second day that Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance and President of the Central Reserve Bank, visited Hankou. On the morning of the same day, Zhou, in his capacity as Minister of Finance and Revenue, personally visited the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in the three provinces of Yu, E, and Gan at 9:30 am, and summoned all staff members, the directors of the three bureaus of salt and tobacco, and all senior personnel above to give lectures in the auditorium of the office. The main points are as follows: (1) In the past, a temporary reorganization committee for finance in the three provinces was established in response to the environment at that time. Now, because the mission has been completed, it will be reorganized, and a special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Finance will be established to meet the new needs and assume a new mission. I hope that you colleagues will continue to work hard. (2) At present, although national expenditures have increased due to the environment, the authorities have not issued public bonds, but rely entirely on tax revenue. Therefore, the national finances are very stable. Since the National Government participated in the war, many undertakings have been handled and require economic support, but the authorities do not want to cause inflation and are making every effort to prevent its expansion. Therefore, the responsibility is even greater in the future. We must strive to increase tax revenue and, on the one hand, enable the exchange of materials and increase production. Therefore, the Central Government has established the Central Materials Review Committee and the General Association for Commercial Control for unified management. On the one hand, it should enable the people to bear the average expenditure borne by the people, and strive to close the gap between the country's income, so that the country's finances can be developed in a healthy manner. We need to be careful in everything, take into account the current situation, and especially work hard in our own positions to complete our mission. (3) At present, the general life is very difficult, and prices are rising continuously. The authorities have also formulated countermeasures to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Moreover, as the world situation is changing rapidly, not only are the people of the warring countries feeling difficult in their lives, but the people of neutral countries are also encountering the same situation. Therefore, in this transitional period of the great era, everyone should continue to work hard with patience and pain, so that the country's tax revenue can be increased, and the general economic life can be stabilized. The tone was calm, the intention was sincere, and the encouragement was added, which lasted for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Finance, in order to promote the import of Chinese products, has decided to establish preferential tariffs on imports from China.

<h3 id="e11">Anti-Axis Powers Attempt to Invade Europe - Date of Launch Allegedly Decided - Stalin Urges Opening of Second Front <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports from London that British officials in Downing Street, in conversations with foreign reporters, hinted that July 3rd has been chosen as the date for the Anti-Axis invasion of Europe. While the reliability of this information cannot be verified, three different sources in Stockholm, Sweden, have confirmed this rumor, suggesting that it was released with the permission of British intelligence. It is expected that the dissemination of this rumor will have a significant psychological effect on the British public, as they were disappointed by the failure to launch the invasion on June 22nd and by reports on Saturday that Stalin has again questioned whether Britain and the United States are willing to carry out this invasion. According to reliable sources, all Soviet diplomats in Britain and the United States received instructions on Friday to use every possible means to urge the realization of Stalin's proposed invasion. At the same time, British and American correspondents in Moscow were earnestly requested by Soviet intelligence to emphasize in their dispatches the opinion of the Soviet people that the invasion of Europe was promised in 1942 and must be launched within the next few days. The extent to which Moscow's new actions will influence British and American military plans remains unknown, but it is clear that the July 3rd date mentioned in London will provide temporary reassurance to the impatient Soviets.</p>
<p>Rome Discusses Invasion Routes</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that the question of where the Anti-Axis forces plan to land in Europe has become a subject of much discussion here. From a general military perspective, the Anti-Axis forces must, at the very least, occupy Sicily before attempting a landing anywhere in Europe. It is believed here that, in theory, the Anti-Axis armies could potentially pass through Spain or Turkey, but this would amount to openly violating the neutrality that both countries are striving to maintain. If these two possibilities are ruled out, there are three other possible routes for an invasion of Europe: southern France, the Balkans, and the Italian mainland. While the Anti-Axis forces may be able to successfully land on the Mediterranean coast of France, the transport of landing troops and supplies via a long sea route should not be overlooked. Moreover, the specialized vessels used for landing are generally small in tonnage and cannot cross the sea from North African bases in 24 hours, and they must also guard against attacks from Axis air and naval forces along the way. Therefore, even if the Anti-Axis forces manage to land successfully, their lines of communication will be constantly threatened, not to mention the considerable distance from the landing site to the Axis countries' home territories and the resistance they will have to overcome along the way. In order to minimize the threat from the air, the Anti-Axis countries must first occupy Sardinia and Corsica to be successful. Regarding an invasion through the Balkans, there are not only difficulties with long sea lines of communication but also the need to occupy all the islands in the Aegean Sea, without which success would be impossible. All of the Anti-Axis forces' reinforcements and supplies will need to be transported through the Mediterranean, as detouring around Africa would be too far. To ensure the safety of this transport, the occupation of Sicily will be necessary. The Anti-Axis armies have little hope of obtaining assistance from organized guerrilla forces in the Balkans or gaining access to the Romanian oilfields, and the terrain there is treacherous, making it easier for the Axis forces to attack from all sides. Rome believes that it would be logical for the Anti-Axis forces to capture Sicily, otherwise, success would be difficult to achieve. People here believe that Britain and the United States are likely to proceed in this manner.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – The German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front have been engaged in intense positional warfare centered on the Velikiye Luki region west of Moscow. Since the 27th, the fighting has expanded north to the Kholm region and south to the Demidov region, with the front line stretching for 200 kilometers. The terrain in this area is extremely unfavorable, with numerous rivers, lakes, and marshes, but the German army is fighting fiercely despite the adverse conditions. The main Soviet force is positioned in the Kholm region. The German army received significant reinforcements and launched a strong attack against the Soviet forces, inflicting heavy casualties and driving them back. The current situation of the German front line in the Kholm region is unknown. Intense positional warfare is also taking place in other areas, including southwest of Sukhinichi, Mtsensk, Izium, Bely Gorod, and the Kupiansk bridgehead. The Soviet army is currently massing approximately 100 to 190 divisions of tanks and mechanized units west and southwest of Moscow. The German authorities also believe that the Anti-Axis forces are about to launch an offensive operation in Europe, so they are paying close attention to the large-scale Soviet offensive on the central front and are preparing comprehensive countermeasures.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government's measures to increase food production focus on rice production. The prices of rice both domestically and abroad have already been moderately increased to make rice farming more profitable. In the previous extraordinary session of the Diet, it was also decided to designate the manufacture of fertilizers and agricultural machinery as one of the five key industries. This is to ensure rice production. Temporary measures to increase food production have also been adopted, including efforts to reclaim land for paddy fields and various other measures related to increasing rice production. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry expects this year's rice production target to be the same as last year, at 73.59 million koku, with 3.18 million hectares of paddy fields planted nationwide. However, the most important factor is the planting situation. According to reports, rice transplanting has already been completed in Hokkaido and the Tohoku region of Japan, and it is actively underway west of Kanto. With ample water, the overall planting situation is progressing smoothly, and the planned planting schedule is expected to be completed successfully.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – July 1st is a day that the Japanese people will never forget, as it was the day 19 years ago (1924) when the United States suddenly implemented the Japanese Exclusion Act, insulting Japan. The United States has always chanted the principles of freedom and equality, but for 19 years until today, it has always practiced its racial inequality. Not only Japan has suffered the shame of this racial inequality. Chinese people have also been subjected to this cruel exclusion act. Such insult to the people of East Asia and aggression against the land of East Asia is the traditional ambition of the United States. Therefore, the distant cause of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was planted in this Japanese Exclusion Act. The indignation of the Japanese people is now tied closely to the Greater East Asia War. In order to defeat Britain and the United States, to crush their insatiable greed and their malicious schemes, they have risen up in unity. China and Japan cooperate, regarding the United States as a common enemy, and striving to complete the Greater East Asia War, the reason is also in this. Therefore, on this July 1st, all the nations of East Asia must be more alert and make further efforts.</p>

<p>When the United States implemented this tyrannical Japanese Exclusion Act 19 years ago, Japanese House of Representatives member Yusuke Tsurumi traveled to the United States to clarify Japan's righteousness. Today, in order to make the world understand the indignation of the Japanese people at that time and the tyranny and unreasonableness of the United States, he specifically talked about the process as follows: The so-called Japanese Exclusion Act implemented by the United States on July 1, 1924, was an unreasonable law established by the United States for immigrants from all countries in the world. The intention was to exclude the British, so immigrants at that time were limited to within a hundred people. However, thereafter, when amending the law, the proposal to completely prohibit Japanese immigration was made to the National Assembly. Japan had protested to the United States against this because this kind of discriminatory treatment was unbearable for Japan. However, due to the results of false propaganda and the abuse of Japan by the unscrupulous politicians of California and other states, this discriminatory treatment was finally passed by the Congress. Seventeen years ago, Japan and the United States had concluded a so-called Gentlemen's Agreement, and the government, based on this agreement, automatically restricted immigration to the United States and abided by it. However, the United States disregarded this 17-year-old covenant and prohibited Japanese people from entering the country for no reason at all. At that time, the Japanese government ordered its ambassador to the United States, Masanao Hanihara, to warn the United States that if the law was passed, there would be "serious consequences," but because of the propaganda of American agitators, Article 12 of the Immigration Act was finally passed in Congress. Although the law never expressly stated that it was for Japanese people, it said that "foreigners who cannot be naturalized under the Constitution are prohibited from entering the country." Its constitution stipulates that "Orientals may not be naturalized as Americans." Because Indians and Chinese were already prohibited from entering the country before this, this article clearly referred to Japanese people. We call this the Japanese Exclusion Act because of this. Since that day, not a single Japanese worker has been able to enter the United States, so the people of Japan are all indignant.</p>
<p>Delivered More Than 100 Speeches in the United States</p>
<p>Before this, Japan had never taken any inappropriate measures against the United States. However, what the United States had imposed on Japan was this kind of unreasonable discriminatory treatment. As a result, I had received telegrams from 37 universities in the United States, requesting that I go to the United States to speak and explain the Japanese people's views on this immigration law. I spent a year and a half in the United States, during which I gave more than 150 presentations on this issue. I still remember what I said at the time: In the past, there had never been any events between Japan and the United States that would hinder diplomatic relations. Trade and cultural exchange were all friendly. However, due to the implementation of the Immigration Act, a major mark has been created in the friendly history of Japan and the United States. If the United States does not amend this law as soon as possible, I dare to say that serious consequences will arise in the future. I said that the fundamental reason for implementing this Immigration Act was neither an economic issue, nor a cultural or legal issue, it was clearly an attack on Japanese people and it was a racial issue. This in fact originated from the American's sense of racial superiority, and their so-called justice, humanity, freedom, and equality, were just a facade. If we look at the United States domestically, we know that they do everything possible to oppress other colored people. The way the United States treats black people is a good example. They are in fact indebted to black people, but they forget their ancestors and turn kindness into hatred. California's prosperity today is due to whose gift? If there were no Japanese farmers, would there be today? However, the United States does not allow Japanese immigrants to have land ownership rights, only granting them a three-year short-term lease. After three years, when the barren land becomes a paradise, it is immediately taken back. In elementary schools, Japanese outstanding children are not only appointed as class leaders, even though Japanese youths graduate from American universities, they are not employed by American companies and commercial houses. California Americans who have married Japanese expatriates resort to all means, using all means to force the United States to take this extremely inhumane action. But as soon as they go to China, they chant justice and humanity, and attack the Japanese government one by one. This is in fact the fuse that the United States itself ignited for the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the only way to truly defeat the anti-Asian Immigration Act is to win the Greater East Asia War. Only when we complete the war can we make them abandon their sense of racial superiority. The Anglo-Saxon's egocentric sense of superiority is in fact an obstacle to human equality, freedom, and happiness. Therefore, the day their sense of superiority is shattered is the day the first page of the new world history unfolds.</p>

<p>The entire city's food procurement and transportation was previously the responsibility of the "Central China Rice and Grain Cooperative." This task will be transferred to the Shanghai District United Rice and Grain Cooperative tomorrow (July 1). The company has decided to officially begin handling transportation and procurement affairs from that day forward, and will supply the City Food Committee with food at officially set prices for distribution to rice shops based on per capita allocation. According to information obtained by Shanghai News reporters, the actual steps taken by the authorities will be generally unchanged. Currently, the City Rice and Grain Committee is already organized. This committee is composed of representatives from the City Food Bureau, the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, with the Director of the Food Bureau serving as chairman. All decisions regarding household registration investigations, increases or decreases in allocation quantities, and price determinations are fully handled by this committee. It is reported that Lu Wenshao, Director of the United Cooperative, traveled to Beijing a few days ago to seek instructions.</p>

<p>Pudong and Puxi are separated by a river, and citizens rely on ferries to travel back and forth. In recent years, the commercial prosperity of the Pudong area has led to a large number of citizens traveling back and forth every day. In the past, water traffic on the Huangpu River was prohibited after 12:00 every night. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the authorities, in order to ensure the security of Pudong and the Huangpu River, have readjusted the water curfew time from the other day, changing it from 8:00 pm every night to the next morning.

<h3 id="e26">Student Aid Registration Soon, Sincere Appeal for Donations, Past Achievements Have Been Understood by All Circles, At This Moment, We Cannot Bear to Sit Idly By <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The 5th Shenbao Reader Student Aid Fund will begin issuing application forms tomorrow. (Note the dates for students in each group to submit their forms, as indicated on the form). There are two types of forms: for those who have previously received assistance and for first-time applicants. Those who have previously received assistance from this newspaper must fill in the amount of assistance received in previous years and their academic performance this semester in detail for auditing and overall assessment. First-time applicants are especially requested to complete the procedures properly, which will make it easier to apply for the next time.</p>
<p>Old Students to Submit a Personal Statement</p>
<p>All students who have received assistance in the past at the junior high, high school, vocational school, and university levels should, in accordance with the daily announcements in this newspaper and the submission dates announced today, attach an essay entitled "Personal Statement," describing the student's family situation and academic experience. The word count should be around 500 words, and it must be a truthful account, avoiding generalizations. Selected essays will be published in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Earnestly Hope for Generous Donations from All Circles</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly appealed for donations from all circles to this year's student aid fund. People from all walks of life also believe that the intellectual deprivation of outstanding students from poor families should be addressed more urgently than general poverty. Those students who have received assistance are like plants that have been fertilized and sprouted. This year, we should help them complete their studies. How can we bear not to provide assistance at the time of their budding and watch them suffer from wind and rain again? If, unfortunately, they have to drop out of school due to financial difficulties, it is the fault of those working on the student aid fund in this newspaper for not being effective enough, and it is something that people from all walks of life cannot bear to watch. The colleagues, aware of the large number of students awaiting assistance, can only continue to make a sincere appeal to all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Uniform Handling of Tuition-Free Quotas</p>
<p>The authorities of major and minor schools have enthusiastically supported this newspaper's student aid movement during this difficult period, donating tuition-free places to benefit young people. We are deeply grateful. We have received many requests this year. In order to ensure uniform admission, please send letters indicating the number of tuition-free places donated by each school. The number of places is not fixed, but it should be based on the full exemption of tuition fees. Those who intend to set up half-fee places will be transferred to the Social Service Department for processing individually, so as not to affect the time for the entire student aid examination and investigation due to procedural reasons. If you can reduce the number of half-fee places in each school by half and change them to full tuition-free places, we would be especially grateful.</p>
<p>Registration Dates for Students in Each Group</p>
<p>The distribution of application forms will be from the 1st to the 5th. Applicants should not ask others to collect the forms on their behalf. After completing the application form, they should come to the office in person to register on time according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>Group Registration Date</p>

<h3 id="e29">Strictly Prohibit Raising Salt Prices in Shanghai, No Increase Allowed Above 1.25 Yuan per Market Catty <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration notified that any increase or decrease in the price of salt sold in various places should be submitted by the local salt affairs authorities to the ministry for approval and implementation. This year, a notice was issued to all jurisdictions regarding the approved increase in the price of salt sold and the retail price of salt for uniform compliance. Now, it has been learned that some soy sauce workshops in Shanghai have raised the retail price of salt to 1.80 yuan per market catty, or have varying prices, which is a disregard for the law. This bureau has a responsibility to correct it immediately and prevent increasing the burden on the people. In addition to ordering the Yuhua Salt Industry Company and the Shanghai Soy Sauce and Wine Industry Association, this notice is issued to all soy sauce workshops and salt shops to comply with the previous price approved by this bureau. The highest retail price per market catty should not exceed 0.225 Japanese yen, which is equivalent to 1.25 yuan in current legal tender. Without the re-determined price by this bureau, it is not allowed to raise the price without authorization, in order to comply with the law. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the law, once verified, they will be dealt with severely and will not be tolerated. Everyone should comply with this.</p>

She came to the radio station on the afternoon of June 16th to assist with the broadcast and disaster relief, showing great enthusiasm for charity. However, the donation of 70,000 yuan was the donation on the donation book brought by President Li Tianzhen, and she requested that the donation be reported on the radio station. However, this association has not received the donation. President Li Tianzhen sent it directly to the Shanghai North China Emergency Relief Association.

<h3 id="e36">Moscow Citizens' Gardens <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yanaka, a special correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun in Moscow, reported to the head office on June 1st of this year about the recent situation in Moscow. Among them, the part about the Moscow citizens opening up city land for farming caused endless emotions. The report has this paragraph. "During the reporter's stay in Moscow, I not only did not hear a single air raid alarm, but I simply did not feel that there was a war that directly threatened the peaceful life of the citizens... The roads to Moscow two years ago were densely covered with tank trenches and fortresses to defend the capital... But today, revisiting the old place, the tank trenches and fortresses have all become citizens' gardens... Now the citizens of Moscow are dividing the roads and city streets leading from the suburbs to the city into farmland for cultivation... There are countless people queuing in front of bookstores to buy single-volume books and pamphlets on horticulture. It is said that the total number of citizen gardens visible everywhere in the city is more than 33,249, and the areas around eye-catching high-rise buildings such as Gorky Street have been transformed into farms... Because the citizens suffered from a lack of vegetables in the past three winters, they started this activity to seek self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>The people of Moscow, after undergoing a baptism of blood, have begun to engage in city land gardening in order to remedy the food panic in case of emergency. Comparing the enthusiasm for increased production in Moscow gardens with the enthusiasm for speculation and waste in Shanghai is truly shameful. Moscow citizens are queuing to buy single-volume books and pamphlets on horticulture, while Shanghai citizens are queuing to buy various rationed cigarettes. May I ask, what can cigarettes produce? There are as many as 33,400 citizen gardens in Moscow, may I ask, how many home gardens and farms do Shanghai citizens have? I hope that Shanghai citizens, especially those with large flower gardens at home, will reflect on themselves, and at the same time, I hope that local authorities will instruct the police or patrols not to obstruct the conversion of private gardens into gardens, because this is a way to remedy the food shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Central Reserve Bank Accepts Banking Industry Suggestions, Plans to Formulate Measures to Facilitate Counterparts <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank took over the clearing and transfer of funds for the liquidation of the Hua Shang Exchange Bank, in order to facilitate the collection and disbursement of funds by counterparts and simplify procedures, it has accepted the suggestions of the banking industry and plans to formulate specific measures, which will be notified to various banks for implementation after approval. The suggestions of the bank are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Cash withdrawal" should be changed to allow each exchange shareholder to issue a current deposit check when cash is needed, with "Pay in cash" indicated on the back of the check and affixed with a formal signature. The original cumbersome procedure of using a remittance slip and canceling the remittance slip separately on the same day should be eliminated to simplify the process. (2) "Collection" Regarding the transfer time of remittance slips, Saturday should be extended to 2:00 pm. The original regulations allowed for acceptance before 5:00 pm every day and before 12:00 pm on Saturdays. The daily business hours should be extended by 2 hours, and Saturdays should also be extended by 2 hours to facilitate interbank transfers. (3) "Collection" Regarding the exchange bank's receipt of entrusted agency exchange bank instruments, which cannot be sent to the Silver Union for entrusted collection, but can only be submitted to the Silver Union for exchange, another regulation should be added: "Entrusted agency exchange bank instruments should be submitted to the Silver Union for exchange and cannot be directly deposited into this bank or entrusted to the Silver Union for collection." (4) "Payment" Regarding the return of remittance slips issued daily to each bank for cancellation and exchange of current deposit checks, in order to reduce accounting procedures, they were originally distributed to each bank for cancellation in the morning of the next day. However, during the bank's closing and settlement period, it should be stipulated that the current day's cancellation and exchange of current deposit checks should be returned in order to facilitate the handling of settlement and closing matters.

<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks started high and then turned low, and were almost hardening again after falling to the bottom. As the price of gold suddenly saw a retreat after soaring, it was the last day before the silver and money industry's semi-annual closing holiday. Investors were still more likely to sell for cash, and people's hearts were dazed. Most stocks ended up rising due to short covering, but the volume was not strong. The long-stagnant new pharmaceutical industry suddenly flourished. China-France rose the most sharply, and New Asia also followed suit. Five Continents, China-West, Sinopharm and others were all firm. The department store industry saw the sharpest fluctuations. Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods companies each saw a large increase. The demand for underwear was high, and Jingfu and Jinglun shirts and socks were firm. The latter briefly broke through the big mark. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile stood firm outside the pass, and China Textile and Great China Weaving were excellent. The public utility industry was the most stagnant. In the cultural industry, World Book Co. alone was flat, while Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. both saw short covering. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Great China Match both reached new highs again. Jiu'an Industrial stood out through the big mark. Tongyi Trust, Defeng Knitting, and Zhongxing Timber were all in more demand than supply. Kang Yuan Can again approached the mark. The financial industry was consistently firm. It is also reported that the 1st and 2nd of next month are the semi-annual closing period for the silver and money industry. The European Common Market counterparts have decided to handle the settlement today and suspend the market for three days starting today, resuming business on July 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Gold shops in this city still redeem gold at the limited price, but the handling fee has increased again. There is no market for counterparts, and non-industry establishment is not strong. After the price soared, it suddenly retraced, but it still rose a lot more than the previous day. The off-market price of Sycee silver also saw an increase.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The public bond black market also showed a trend of rising and then suddenly retracing, but it ended up higher than the previous day due to short covering.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The cloth market continued the upward momentum of the previous day and continued to be excellent. Moreover, due to high demand and low supply, market prices rose steadily. However, at the close, there were many floats and various parties selling off, and people's hearts turned soft. As a result, it was higher than the previous day due to short covering. Longtou fine cloth was up more than thirty, Four Gentlemen were up yuan, Peach Blossom Women's Lin Bai Mao printed cloth, American Prim Color fine cloth, Bishishu Xiang, and Poplin all had factory orders to open, and prices were also excellent.</p>

<p>Goldsmiths: The Goldsmiths' Association was originally only organized by the "Da Tong Hang" (large goldsmiths), and the "Xiao Tong Hang" (small goldsmiths) and "Xin Tong Hang" (new goldsmiths) were never reported to the local authorities in Huai, so there was no association organization. Now, the association, in accordance with the instructions of the Feng authorities, has taken the initiative to adjust first, requiring members of the small and new goldsmiths to join the association. Registration has begun, dividing the large, small, and new goldsmiths into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A has twelve members, and Group B has thirteen, all of whom have joined. Group C, the new goldsmiths, are continuing to register with the association.

<h3 id="e46">The Problem of Incompleteness <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Min</p>
<p>Someone once mocked us, saying that we are a nation with only five minutes of enthusiasm. When starting something, everyone is incredibly enthusiastic, but when they encounter some setbacks or defeats and feel that it is not easy, their interest wanes. Slowly, they let the matter subside, or no one even mentions it anymore. These are all true, and there is no exaggeration, especially in this day and age. For example, if something is made a big deal, everyone feels righteously indignant and must do it well. But after a while, seeing that there is no effect, or there are some achievements, everyone does not ask or hear, as if they have already finished it. In reality? It is not so. It's just that more people are participating in the matter, but what will happen later is certainly not known. Probably as time goes on, the matter no longer feels serious, and no one will pursue the past again. Someone hears that he is doing something, doing something. The able ones work harder, doing this and that. He is doing this, he is doing that. Ask him if he has the ability to do one thing well and finish it? That is not necessarily the case, but he has already started doing another new one. Ask him if he is sure about the new thing? It is also very difficult to say. He is very happy when he starts, but after a while, he feels that it is not easy, or he is satisfied with some achievements, and he has no more interest, so he goes to do something else. The other is the same. He also feels that it is not easy, or he feels that he has some achievements and is satisfied, and he feels that he has no more interest, so he goes to find new things to do. He does everything like this, with no beginning and no end, giving up halfway, with a fluke mentality. As a result, he is doing everything, but he has not done anything well.</p>
<p>These are all suffering from the problem of incompleteness, like a person who feels pain here, so he goes to treat it here. Then he feels pain there, so he goes to treat it there. But he forgets that the pain here has not fully healed. It is important to take care of the new pain there, but at the same time, don't forget to relapse the old illness that is about to be cured. How to effectively plan to heal this and then start to treat the new disease that has arisen there? Or, for the sake of treating the new important one, don't forget to treat the old disease at the same time, so that the effort falls short. The new one is not good, and the old one is even worse.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Summer Training for Teachers <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Si</p>
<p>Introduction to the Summer Primary School Teacher Training Association</p>
<p>I heard such a fact from a friend.</p>
<p>"A female teacher who had just come out of school was in charge of singing and games in the lower grades. Because her teaching methods and materials were lively and novel, she was very popular with the children. Later, as time went on, the children's interest and feelings for her gradually decreased in inverse proportion. At this time, she felt very strange. One day, she heard several children criticizing like this: 'Mr. × always sings the same thing, what's the fun!'" She was silent.</p>
<p>What does this mean? The fact is very obvious. Children are progressing rapidly, while teachers are stuck in the past, stagnating and not moving forward. When this contradiction develops to the extreme, it manifests as the strange phenomenon learned above.</p>
<p>This is naturally a morbid state - an unhealthy strange phenomenon. The main reason is that teachers are too busy and their treatment is too poor, which affects the emotions and further studies of teachers. Therefore, if a teacher wants to gain the respect and love of children and be able to give children education that is in line with the times, further studies are absolutely necessary for themselves.</p>
<p>A year is easy, and the long summer vacation is coming. Primary school teachers should use this vacation to do beneficial elective studies. This year, the Shen Bao is acting in the spirit of social service and is preparing to hold a summer training session for primary school teachers during the summer vacation. It is entrusted to the Shanghai YWCA to handle it. The opening of such a training session is really good news for primary school teachers.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the training session is naturally the curriculum related to further studies in primary school education. This curriculum includes a total of seven courses: (1) Practical Problems of Primary School Administration, (2) Primary School Teaching Materials and Methods, (3) Education and Child Psychology, (4) School Children's Practical Mental Hygiene, (5) Compulsory Education Problems, (6) Primary School Training Problems, (7) Educational Principles. The teachers hired are all famous professors and education experts from universities in Shanghai. In addition to the curriculum, there are celebrity lectures and visits and discussions every week. For the sake of teachers' entertainment and physical and mental health, there are also sports (badminton, tennis, and swimming), singing, drama, and preparations for health checkups.</p>
<p>The address of the training session is located at the Shanghai Girls' High School on Tongfu Road, Dagu Road, which is a spacious and ideal school building.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of difficulties;</p>
<p>Wide avenues,</p>

<h3 id="e49">Self-Blame and Sinners <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Luo</p>
<p>"Self-blame," when explained from a good perspective, can enable us to reflect on our own mistakes, understand our own shortcomings, and encourage ourselves to conduct ourselves with an attitude of respecting others and learning from their strengths. In this way, we will seek progress in everything and benefit infinitely. Conversely, another kind of excessive "self-blame" is tantamount to self-abasement. We believe that we are incapable of doing anything, so we don't do it. Gradually, it creates a trend of fearing "life," escaping from reality, and being cowardly and retreating in everything. We believe that our every move is a criminal act, and we don't even dare to look people in the eye when walking on the street during the day, as if others are casting a contemptuous glance at him. Therefore, he has no peace all day long. What a pitiful and terrible "life" this is!</p>
<p>Needless to say, the "self-blame" we need is, of course, the former one.</p>
<p>Someone said, "People in the world can often only see the mistakes of others, but it is extremely difficult to discover their own shortcomings." This sentence means, "We can only blame sinners, but we cannot blame ourselves." In fact, sinners are not absolutely bad. If we can contribute extremely valuable opinions and go to blame sinners with a fairly friendly attitude in a "persuasive" way, then it may not be a good thing. However, in this society, there are many people who blame sinners in a "nitpicking" manner.</p>
<p>If we can spend some of the time we spend on blaming sinners on self-blame, then I believe it will be of great help to ourselves, to our families, and to society...</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Material Selection Route of National Films <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ne</p>
<p>The output of national films has been the most prosperous in recent years. Because of the increase in output, the material selection has become chaotic. If we merge its lines, seventy to eighty percent belong to love stories of men and women, and less than one or two tenths can be considered educational and literary. The reason is that love films are easy to harvest in business, and the material selection is also convenient. Educational films are not only difficult to select materials and flow into "stereotyped" textbooks, but also suffer setbacks in business. Under such circumstances, everyone abandons the root and pursues the tip, trying their best to make the film imitate Hollywood's love comedies, or literary tragedies. Movies have also changed from educational tools to love textbooks.</p>
<p>If we compare the two plays "Good Night, Flowers, and Moonlight" and "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon," their material selection routes are the same. Everyone has some love for the American film style, and they all make a love story into a comedy. However, the achievement of "Good Night, Flowers, and Moonlight" seems to be higher than "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon." Because it has added a question. This question belongs to the social aspect, which is much more important than the question of the female secretary and the manager in "Floating Clouds Covering the Moon," and it is also more suitable in Chinese society. This proves that works grown on the same route still need to be added with nourishing fertilizer by the cultivators.</p>
<p>Secondly, in recent years, the material selection of national films has tried its best to focus on the dark side of the so-called upper class society. Although there are many evil things happening in high-rise buildings, they cannot get rid of the temptation of managers and young girls, and money... etc. This kind of "upper class society" darkness is still far away from the general small citizens. To know that the people who spend a lot of money to watch movies are 100% entertainment, and those who watch movies in third- and fourth-rate theaters can increase their knowledge in addition to entertainment. The dark side of the so-called lower class society is of course more cruel and painful than the "upper class." They hope that everyone will know, but films similar to this situation are rarely seen today. In the past, there were "Street Angel" and "City Night," which gained unprecedented value in film art. Now filmmakers can also pay attention to this point, and countless audiences are welcome. The best subject matter is none other than the "Zhang Jinhai Case," how the local ruffians who live in the dark side of society deceive and oppress. Although it is not based on this story, it is a good route for material selection.</p>
<p>After watching "Mother," everyone felt that it was an excellent subject matter. The themes of "Four Sisters" and "Three Flowers" are also good, but they seem to be far worse than "Mother." The reason is that the latter shifted the main line to another side, and the weight was immediately reduced. This is a place that producers should pay attention to, which is equivalent to performing "The True Story of Ah Q" and trying to make the audience laugh.</p>
<p>I hope that the material selection routes of domestic films in the future can be broader, and on each route, we can never forget to use the "educational tool" as the main trunk.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Continued Report on the Disaster in Chaoshan <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Yechu</p>
<p>Recently received a letter from relatives, describing the tragic situation of the disaster victims in the Chaoshan area, saying that the Chaoshan area has many mountains and little land, and the food supply is insufficient. The request for foreign rice relief has been requested. In recent years, due to traffic congestion, the food panic has become increasingly serious, especially in Chaoan, Chaoyang, and Chenghai counties. For several months, there has been no rain, the fields and crops have withered, and the land is red for thousands of miles. The early winter harvest has also been hopeless. Some people eat sweet potato leaves and tree bark because they cannot afford to buy rice. Some people are separated from their wives and children because they cannot find food. There are even more people who cannot endure the hunger and commit suicide by taking poison or drowning. All kinds of tragic situations are difficult to describe. Hundreds of people die of starvation every day. Recently, there has been a plague of tigers, and many people have died of heatstroke. The miserable people are suffering from this natural disaster and war. It is truly a case of misfortune never coming singly. I sincerely hope that our Chaozhou fellow villagers in Shanghai and those who are eager to help and charitable organizations will rise up to teach and help, so as to avoid the expansion of the disaster. This is the most sincere prayer.</p>
