<h3>華泰輪失事責任問題</h3>
<p>本市中華輪船公司華泰輪，於本月九日在新港江面失事，旅客船員千餘人中，遇救更生者僅二百五十人左右，其餘四分之三以上，皆葬身魚腹，誠爲近年以來未有之慘劇。</p>
<p>華泰輪傾覆之原因，公司方面諉過於乘客不守秩序，未待船內乘客下齊，即蜂擁而上，因此上下旅客，皆　集於船身之一面，以致船身傾斜，舷門進水，奔流甚猛，無法制止。據脫險歸來之旅客所談目　情形，則謂該輪乘客，以單幫客人佔大多數，所携貨物，均堆置船上最高艙面，非待船員談妥條件，收到規費，不令入艙，因此上重下輕，船身傾斜，致　覆沒。而航政當局之談話，則認爲該船傾覆，載重超過規定限額一倍以上，實爲主因，而船員不遵定章，未受檢定，對於駕駛管理，亦容有乘方之處，綜合三方面談話，加以剖析，責任問題，大致巳可明瞭。</p>
<p>乘客不守秩序，不待船內乘客下濟，即行蜂擁而上，以致上下乘客，集中船身一側，因而失去重心，竟以傾覆下沉，雖係公司諉過之辭，也許是事實。因爲不守秩序，爭先恐後，是吾國國民的劣根性，在火車站電車站郵政局以及油店米店門前，隨時都可以看到這種現象，尤其近來船隻短少，單幫客人日增，擁軋淩亂，更在意中，假使這次華泰輪的傾覆，確　由此原因，我們就希望一般旅客，經過此番敎訓之後，嗣後能隨時隨地嚴守秩序，利人並以利己。</p>
<p>至如脫險旅客口述的情形，我們認爲更近事實。近年以來，交通機關服務人員，祇有少數不是剝削壓軋旅客的，何况華泰輪乘客定額，航政局祇限五百三十八人，而船員竟達二百人之多，苟不剝削旅客，勒緊規費，則此二百人從何維持生活？由此觀察，將旅客携帶貨物，堆積艙面，逐件議價，逐件下艙，不但是可以想像到的，而且還是當然的，卽此一點，中華公司之不能諉卸責任，巳屬顯然。</p>
<p>其次中華公司還有不能諉卸責任者兩點：第一是華泰輪在新港失事以前，已因駕駛人員之疎忽，及不諳航綫，於常陰沙江面突告擱淺，全船幾遭不測，駕駛人員爲全船旅客所託命，責任何等重大，公司因何竟以不　航綫之人員担任駕駛？航政局對於該公司船員應受檢定，乘已三令五申，公司因何竟不遵辦？第二，華泰輪乘客限額，航證局已規定爲五百三十八人，公司何以　限載客至一倍以上？公司對於此　事實，又將何辭自解？</p>
<p>此外，我們對於航政機關，也認爲不無　職之處，輪船載客的超過限額，早成爲一般的現象，華泰輪的　限載客，也決不止一次，航政局應及早糾正，則不致釀成此種鉅大慘案。至如船員的檢定，既爲部令所規定，就應該嚴格執行，更不能任令該公司延不遵行。假使限額可以隨意超過，船員可以不受檢定，豈非法　等於具文，航政局等於虛設，那末我們久何責有此法令，有此機關。</p>
<p>最後，我們一幫的主張，目前交通秩序的　亂，其重要　結，全由於物資不能暢利交流，單幫客人日見增加。我們認定要維持交通秩序，必須先從暢利物資流通，　淸單幫客人入手，這也是統制機關最大的責任。</p>
<h3>大東亞精神抱負　須全域普遍實現　近衛論共同宣言深遠意義</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　近衛文　公書，自前年解　　居林下以來，久未發表政見，最近忽撰論文一篇，題爲「關於大東亞宣言」，刊載於東亞同文會出版之雜　「中國」十二月號，　大東亞共同宣言及中，日同盟之本旨，幸直加以關明，並力言興亞之大精神，必須普遍在全東亞實現，此係近　公以在野之身。首次發表公式見解，　値注目，玆將全文　錄如下：</p>
<p>本年十一月六日，　行大東亞會議時·中國·日本·泰國·滿洲·菲律賓及緬旬各國代表所表決，而公布於全世界之「大東亞共同宣誓」，係人類史上所燃之不　炬火，而有　永垂紀念</p>
<p>之價値，　　無應　　者。　　言所聞明共存共榮，獨立親和，　揚文化，經濟繁榮，宜　世界進展之五大原則，不僅係建設大東亞共榮圈之網領，且　爲確立世界和平之根基，故　　　在全世界歷史上，誠可謂開一新紀元。該宣言之所具　　，完全基於八　一宇之精神，宣言閉首明示：「夫使世界各國各得其所，相互扶助，共享萬國共榮之樂，此係確立世界和平之根本要　「一點，即可充分證明上述事實。八紘一宇之大理想，如在大東亞出現，即係「建設基於道義之共存共榮之秩序」，此事具體化時，或係「相互尊重自主獨立，互助敦睦之成果，以　大東亞之親和」，或係「相互尊重其傳統，伸張各民族之創　住」，以　「提高大東亞之文化」或係一於互惠而密切提　，謀經濟之發展」，以增進「大東亞之繁榮」，如是大東亞各國於輿</p>
<p>萬國敦睦</p>
<p>邦交，泯　人種的差別，普　　文化交流，進而開發資源，以賞　於世界之進步方面，可實現　渾之世外的經　。際此　度苛烈有史以來之大戰爭中，而發表此項大　　，共所具　義至　　遠，使人不　過　　　，　然　敬，但現成大東亞共榮圈之中心者，即係中·日·　三國，允以視中日兩國之　向如何，對於大東亞全戰之運命，具有極大影響。　於中·日兩國，自中國國民政府　　南京以來，面目煥然一新，由汪主席所謂「同甘共苦」關係，而百尺竿頭，更進一步，視以「同生共死」之精神，共同其興亡　　之運命。中華民國於本年一月九日　戰以來，中·日兩國即以共同點英·美兩國完　戰爭之</p>
<p>鞏固決心</p>
<p>及信念，發表共同宣言，決於軍事，政治，經濟三方面　完全協力，此事我人　　尚新也。其後日本即逐次交還在華全部專管租界，或承認收囘上海及厦門公共和界及北　使館區，更實施取消洽外法　，此事對於中·日兩國之交誼，益臻鞏固，中華民國自革命以來，多年所切望之自主獨立，於茲在形式上即告完整，國民政府之政治力，中華民國國民之民力，由是更加提高，達到復與光輝之五千年文化之黎明，此事對於我等亞洲同胞之內心　堪慶賀也。且中·日同盟條約，於本年十月三十日成立，兩國相互　　尊重其自主獨立，密切協力，以建設基於　義之大東亞，以貢默於全世界之和平，此即於大東亞宣言前所盟約之軸心國使命，實引　全世界之一致注目也。日本已與滿洲·泰國·緬甸·菲律賓諸國，一致確立基於　義之</p>
<p>密切協力</p>
<p>關係，　承認印度　立政　及南方居民參政，一面又與中國　立盟約，此事在古今史上，　無先例可曙，但世界　對於此　大　　，大抱負，歪曲　　或不加理解，或認此事當實際　　之　，極易發生　肘，此種傳　，我人殊表遺憾。令藉此機綠，努力　明大來亞宣　及中·日同盟之本　，同時並對此種與亞大精　，切盼能展開一大規模運動，　東亞十　民衆均能獲得深刻了解也。</p>
<h3>東京建築　大東亞迎賓館</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　前東京府曾收買營區內澀谷區前總川家遠公　邸，建築武道館，以紀念紀元二千六百年，惟東京改都　，當局為以此作為大東亞共榮圈內各民族其同修練之塲所，故久決定改此為大東亞迎賓館及步道塲，練成塲等之用，現正積極修理，不久即可竣工。按該處面　計共一萬二千七十三坪，建築物面積為一千二百八十一坪，各種建築均極豪華狀麗。</p>
<h3>秦國議會通過　明年度預算　歲出入均較去年增加</h3>
<p>盤谷十七日中央社電　泰國議會十六日通過明年度　　。　　出　　三三九，七四一·〇〇巴茲，內訃一般歲出一八三·〇〇〇〇〇巴茲，　　會計　出一五一四四八三〇〇〇〇〇巴玆，比　本年度預算　出　　二億八千萬巴茲（包括追加預算）歲入一億四千一百萬巴茲，均有　　增加。尢以一般歲出較去年之一億五千萬巴茲，增加　三千萬巴茲，因　出之增加，　乃須　增加處入，　行公債等方策以彌補之加關於增稅方面，有逐次增　稅，　稅以及各種稅收之傾向，又政府　正計劃提高關稅率，並　收砂　稅，獨身稅，飲食娛樂稅及　他新稅，明年度之歲入確可增加俾以歲入彌補一般歲出，又爲彌補投資會計歲出，則將發行公　及由於議會前次通過之「　常時　用統計法」之施行，各銀行借用機關根據公債中有規定購買公　銀行信用機關之存款增加，及一般國民之儲蓄增加等，一二億巴茲之公債自不難消化，放　國之財致仍能維持其健全性。</p>
<h3>滿發揮國家總力　實施手帖制　身份證明便利配給物資</h3>
<p>新京十七日中央社電　滿洲國政府為確保明確每個國民身份，使發揮國家總力，　期國政得以圓滑運用起見，曾於今春製成國民手帖實施要綱，並急　　備頒　國民手帖法，此法業於十七日　參議府會議通過，決定明年一月一日起實施。此手帖之制度，不僅為確定國家動員，計劃勞動行政體制，及其他國家政策之根　，且可以證明工人身份。凡持有手帖者可領配各種物資。並有其他各種方便，其發給對　如次：　除軍人　　外，凡在總務　　大臣所定之地域內　住者。　　兵　　者，及召　決定者，而未入　者。　剛民　勞　公服務　務者，及志願　民勤勞　公告。　根據職能登記法令而須登記者。　林業，水產業，礦山業，工業，土木建築業。及交　業　　　儲　　於　務總理大臣　定事業之勞　者。</p>
<h3>華北開發華中振興　兩公司法修改案　日定例閣議昨正式通過</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日政府頃就行將提出第八十四次帝國講會之法律案要　　　進行準　，並於十七日定例閣　中，提出華北開發公司法及華中　與公司法中改正法律　要　　八　　即正式決定，並於下午三時由　報局　　　下：軍北　　公司法及華中振興公司法中改正法律案要綱：　日政　　於大東亞戰爭途行上必要之事業，得　定華北關發公司及華中振　公司資金之供　，　　之建設及其他必要事項之制度。　當已施行　項命令　，　公司或華中　與公司，除現行法上之　　外，爲實行　命令，得　管必要之業務。　對　　之　行限制、由現行　納　木之五倍　張至十倍。</p>
<p>日戰時經濟　愈益堅强　賀屋藏相談話</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　據大阪電話，日賀　　　十六日正午在此間設　款待財界　人，席次會發表演說，說明戰時下日本經濟力愈益　實之情形，其大電如次：本年度公　消化成績，甚爲良好，自年初起至十一月末止八個月間，僅租稅收入即達九十八億之多，以之輿百零八億公債發行　相較，計消化公債發行額百分之九十五，此外，更有股票收入額約三十億，社債新發行額約十八億，日本之決戰政推進極為順利。關於國民貯　如　政貯蓄及其他各種貯金，均　著　加，本年上半度之國民貯蓄額，　計已達一百三十七億餘萬元，佔木年度二百七十億元　　目標額中百分之五千九，總合中日事　以來，迄本年九月未之國民貯　額而　，計約達八百六十七億元，現恐巳突破九百億。本月十日　　決定之昭和十九年度一般曾計概算總額，爲百五十三億餘萬元，且臨時軍事　之追加豫算，亦將　相當鉅　，此種增大之財政，大半須依　租稅輿公債。關於租稅將在通常議會中提出增稅法案，　增稅額　超過遺加預算，包括一般會計及臨時　事費之公債發行額（所要　），亦將　本年度更爲增大，又　計擴充生產資金之需要　，亦將　相當　　，目前能滿足此　　大財政及產業上之要求者，惟有增强國民貯　。</p>

<h3>以物咨培養戰力應實行節省電流　京中日協議會已決定辦法</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　當此大東亞戰爭巳進入決戰　段之際，為完遂戰爭，自當以一切物資，　默於培養戰力。本京方面，特於十七日召開中日聯席協議會，協議內容有如下各點：</p>
<p>最近電力電燈方面之燃料，十一月份起，使用量巳减少約三成，此並非因煤炭之產最减少，實可謂保存資源。轉用於戰力。　南京電力原料巳减少三成，電燈電力之使用　，倘不見減少，則一個月中之後十天，將停止供電。　故為完成此戰爭目的，中日雙方均應節約電力，日本僑民巳自十二月起，實施電流節約。“軍方面曾兩度下令，取消不必要地點之電燈裝置，必要成需換用小光燈泡。南京十萬市民，亦應即日實行，但今後需請求對策，設法節電三成至四成五成。　將來實施大量節電時，南京中”雙方之警備及治安問題，固然不無影　，市民自亦將感覺相當不便。惟如認淸事實之眞義則絕無不安與不便之說矣。　或者以為節電將影響產業生產、前拒絕節電。但據專家調查、日本國實施　達節電三成之結果，不世與未减以前有同等效力，且至獲得較以前尙高之能率。中國使用之電力機，電力較低减少三成，絕不成問題。　電熱器較普通電燈消費量為大，故必需極力避免使用，因上述協議結果，決定今後方針如次：　規定節約電力宣傳通，向民衆澈底宣傳。　澈底調查囤積小燭光電泡者，嚴加取締，並設法運入小燭光燈泡。　在某一時期，下令禁止販賣電類熱水器，電熨斗等電熱用品。　積極加强檢查倫電，並加以取締　凡偷電及不協力節電者。一概停止供給。</p>

<h3>日高橋大將　披瀝必勝決心　在中日記者招待會上演詞</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本海軍元老高橋大將，於昨（十七）日在日駐華艦隊報道部招待席上，接見中日新聞記者團時，披瀝日本必勝決心，及　述現時作戰情狀甚詳，茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>訪問視察</p>
<p>高橋閣下首　：余此與亞大會，藍中日滿密切之團結，首以三國之興亞團體結成聯擊，以共　爭取大東亞戰爭之勝利，此次余所負任務，先在平津等地與中國各方人士懇議，翼對未來之興亞團　之推進建成、以促進與亞團體之交流為目的，余顏自慚力不勝任。以往未得有平津之行，此次尙作首次之防問，同時順便又赴　匯包頭張家口等地作實地視察，　余任日　與亞總本部之顧問，過去未能明瞭平津及　　之實情，今番親往觀察　獲得成果，是以頗覺滿足，目前　本之與亞總本部，隸大政翼　會內，總木部總理由前內相及文相水野氏任之，顧問則由陸軍大將松并石根氏，及前文拓相永幷槨太郞氏及本人担任。</p>
<p>現時戰狀</p>
<p>高橋閣下　對大東亞現時戰狀發表意見，謂大東亞戰爭開始以來，二年以還在此過程之中，戰况經過及戰　情形，諒諸君早已洞悉，自本年一月起至十一　，前綫戰况，如瓜　爾加納爾典，留申羣島之戰况激烈，及阿圖島山畸部隊之悲壯偉大殉國，給與敵方甚大之痛苦及損害，再次為波根維爾島及吉爾勃特島之日軍。得重大勝利，關於被根維爾島數美登陸，經日軍，以猛烈攻擊包團，即獲得偉大戰果，再波　爾同及吉爾勃　島之，戰　均有非常，後在被基兩島獲得大勝，將此項心理完全消減，故此二次空戰，實具有重大意義，然一般人對戰局前途之顧慮，乃為事實，惟一般人對戰局情形，更須明瞭在廣大之太平洋與陸上之作戰，情形不同，此點亦應特別加以明瞭者。</p>
<p>敵受重創</p>
<p>海上作戰之最大目的，乃將敵艦隊殲滅，並在島嶼般置飛機塲之根據地，利用以擊滅敵方艦隊，我人以觀敵美軍作戰之經過情形，美國在瓜達爾加納爾島阿國島新佐治島發動　動後，即在若干地創造新根據地，在每一次企圖蠢動時，發動大規模之戰艦及驅逐艦，是以彼　所蒙受損害，諸君均已深知，總之美海軍所運用之手段，終難達到其企圖之目的，反遭受慘重損害，故佊輩雖　取値，我而方所佔領各島，其價値及意義之重大與之相變，頰為明顯。以是而觀，我方巳極為有利，故我人根據事實觀測判斷，對敵　　無　關心，且因防繫固頗為安全。</p>
<p>觀測今後</p>
<p>次觀測今後之戰局前途，屬於今後之戰爭觀測，極為不易，對敵究竟尙未可逆料，余特指出重要之二點以言，　預料今後戰爭必為長期戰，　今後戰爭之延長，無論至如何時間，勝利定屬日本。關於長期戰爭理由煩多，在海上作戰日本有必勝信念，念及日俄戰事之局面，更有充分之把握，在日俄之戰時，猶無　水艇及飛機，日木　神速之武器，將敵方主力艦擊破，故回想當初及推測今後，日木定得勝利，發揮偉大之戰　力，第一飛機為海上主要力量，在此次戰爭中，無論敵類之企圓如何，吾人憑過去力量及今後之攻擊，敵美企置必告粉碎，而製造戰艦一艘需時二三年，製造飛機則可於短期完成，日本具有龐大之空軍，毀損敵艦，此乃有利日本義期性之戰爭·第二觀　長期戰爭之理由，當初日俄之戰之國際情勢，興現今不局，當時為日俄兩國作戰，而今為大東亞戰爭，範圍廣泛，且為日俄戰爭尙有人從中仲裁，今則無人調停，是以目前戰爭完全憑實力而戰，必為長期戰無疑，以上所述乃余個人判斷長期戰之意見。</p>
<p>精神必勝</p>
<p>旋披瀝此次戰爭，日力量可獲勝利，而我日本則以物質及精神之意氣，予以克復，此為日本惟一之力量，關於此點見解，蓋因敵美依賴物質，而我日本則端為精神與技術力二種力量取勝，但美國雖亦精神及技術力與我日本相較，終告不如。高橋大將並特聞明四點要素如下兩國之人力加以比較。即將大學生及共他學生徵入陸海軍，以觀美徵二十歲以上入役，於此足見美之人力不足，故右，而吾日本方面，果有大學生　習軍事，此尙為最近之事實，同時集婦女軍隊，故在兵力及人力比較，日本人力常較美　　充沛，由於以上之判斷，而觀美在人力方面恐慌巳極，再言資源物資，與戰艦飛機及其他，在我日木允分生產，設備充務，突飛猛晋之增加，以充分配給陸海軍所需要，後方生產，充分洪給，故以此人力資源言，日本豐富異常，自信絕不負於美國。</p>
<p>日本優勢</p>
<p>科學問題，在大東亞戰前，美有電波探信機及土木工程學科之苦，埋頭苦幹，現已飛速進步，今與相比巳超卡其上，故確信科學戰在日本，決不差於美團，　日美團之　神比較，當自信在美國之上，無庸再述，而日本精神力量，已在此次戰銣表現於世界之前，　技術力問題，當華府會議之　後，在首次壓戰中。日與英同盟。被迫向德宣戰。共時日海即代。英海軍　任太平洋之防　，發揮　大精神，而英國僅有少數巡洋艫，所有力量集中本國，故日本不但防衛太平洋，且負防衛印度洋之任務，當時之根據地在屋加坡，即今之昭南島，詎莫尙不滿足其慾　，一再要求日本更大之協助，後又在馬爾太集中海上力量，作另一根據地，在首次世界大戰，英果將德擊敗，其原因當為日與英致勝，戰後不久，日英美法義又舉行軍縮會議，　上英美對日恣意壓　，當初日英同盟條約，由於英之厭棄，乃宜告無效，且迫日本縮軍减少於美五與三之比，當時”出席代表　　不滿，惟因日國內情形及各方關係，　氣吞聲，予以承認，於後二三年內，日忍受一切，以進守條約，故在此情形下，美國則將未完成軍艦擊沉，日本則將已完成之第二流戰艦香取，席島，安藝，薩摩，及其他十餘艘自沉，日本對此情形，一爾流淚，一面忍氣犧牲，同時更痛心海軍少年兵之服務，然常時日本雖在軍縮時橫遭壓迫，而自信堅強，抱定倍，日一日與英美開戰。決非予大勝而不休，故常時以劣敗優，及以孤克衆之決心，全力苦幹，東鄕元帥猶言有「艦數限制。無限制訓練」，　此二句，日本之數量雖負而精神力量訓練未敗，於後十數年中，日　軍之猛力　練未已，故有得此効果，不惜犧牲以一戰艫發揮二三　之力量，以一架飛機發揮五架十架飛機之力量。此以一抵十，以百抵千之　大力量，在此大東亞戰爭中。充分明顯表現。是以日本之力量超逾英美之上，尤以閃綫將士及後方民氯愈旺，信心更為堅定，大東亞戰爭勝利，必屬日本無疑。</p>
<p>精神動員</p>
<p>高橋大將最後並，日本陸軍作戰力量　　軍　同，在日後方一倦國民，某不與前　將士　　配合，發掦那門意氣，一致精辦動員，堅決信心，爭取最後勝利，而此次戰爭勝利，並非　於日本一國，為中日滿緬案錢以及東亞菜　國內之各民族所共同，　言之即經多年歷迫之東亞。在此戰爭中已　復東亞人之東亞。亞緬亞人之亞細亞。氏未謂，余此次赴滿華北華中之訪問，目見各地人民與日本採取同一步　，青心努力，　獻大東亞戰爭，此點余深感痛快，余敬祝中華民國人民一心一德，團結男力東亞戰爭完途，實不勝企待之至，故在此情緒下，大家奮門努力，確信戰爭辦利，余可斷言大東亞戰爭決不失收，並希　全中國期野，均深信日本定獲騰利以抱此信心，則前途有利當諸君為　新聞界人士，盡報道之天責，多多宣揚。</p>

<h3>一區經濟處　馮處長談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　上海特別市第一區公署經濟處長陳日平，因丁憂辭職，遺缺由陳市長委馮　接任，　處長　已到處視事。昨發表談話云……本人奉市長之命，　　本處事務，自當　體中失意旨，在市長指導之下，與市府各高級長官盡力本處職掌範圍以內之事，惟本市旣爲巾國經濟之重要地區，各種經濟問題，複雜異常，本人才膚學淺，能力有限，尙望各界人士全市民　，隨時予以協助。俾本處所管掌之事務，更有所改進，更可以滿足區內一般民衆之希望。第一處經濟處之組設，已經過相當之時日，　理本市第一第八兩區之物資配給，及整理取締管內之經濟事務，已有相當政績，本人在未進一區公署以前，甚表欽佩，例如物資配給事宜，在　到可以配給之　段，對於交涉採辦運送　藏　等，經濟處同人必須經過許多的辛苦和麻煩，才能達到配給的目的。際此戰時物貨缺乏，　需增加生產之時，辦理自更覺困難，要之戰時經濟與平時經濟不同，在戰時物資勞必感覺缺乏。政府爲顧全大衆經濟生活起見，爲謀公平的普遍的配給起見，不得不厲行經濟之統制，一面盡力生產之增加、一面　　貨運之暢通，但在未能充分完成上述目的之前，在生活上自雖免感覺不便，希望新聞界諸君能體察市府當局改過本市經濟之苦心，對社會人士時加以解釋幸甚。又該經濟處各科人事問題，過去各員均勤於工作，且爲駕輕就熟，故一仍照舊，並無更動</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>限制企業增資</h3>
<p>實業部　次長昨爲政府將限制各地公司工廠之任意增資，曾發表談話，說明投資之運用，必須興各種企業之進展相配合，否則難免趨於變態之經營，其次則成立已久之公司工廠，其資產價値旣非昔比，提價增股，自無不合，　對於資產升値比率，如不加以相當限制，任憑高抬價額，一旦物價　平，公司資產表面上　存　大之數字，而其股票價值已告貶落，公司基礎，亦將動搖，又其次則升股辦法，亦屬於法無據。</p>
<p>以上一段談話，可以說是一般公司工廠無限制增資的一帖預防劑。自談話中的第一點而　，正合於日前郭宣傳次長廣播時所謂有一些人，聽說國家提倡生產，我也說增加生產，可是輪到做的時侯，都把它當作一種玩意，常然沒有好效果的。自第二點　，公司工廠於提價增股之中，不可不愼防股　之過份膨脹，　免將來遭遇「頭重脚　」的危險。自第三點　，升股辦法，在公司工廠方面，或自　爲「戯法人人會變，各有巧妙不同」，可是，在主管當局方面，似應資成大家遵循一種最合理的標準。</p>

<h3>洛陽路上一醫院　上海南洋醫院參觀記</h3>
<p>從洛陽路（舊福煦路），從南通路（舊薩坡賽路）或是從泰山路（舊　飛路），都可以看到「上海南洋醫院」的當　軒昻的大門，從這一院三大門，巳可推想到該院的規模吧？然而、還是進去瞧瞧吧，這是一所富於歷史性而又放近代化的醫院，是不只為富有者並且為　善大衆服務的大醫院，是不只從事治療而且從事培養新醫人材的大醫院呢！</p>
<p>光榮的歷史</p>
<p>洛陽路七十七號的上海南洋醫院大門，在新型的建築前面，還聳得着古色古香的一座牌坊，點綴這是一所具有歷史性的醫療機關。</p>
<p>充滿着法國貴族邸窩的幽靜而崇高的情調，院所是給小的庭　圜繞着叫，可是那巨人般掃入雲霄的棕櫚樹，恰似一首南倒像是南洋醫院命名的來由了。可是該院的陸平先生却說起這裏還有一枝與中國革命有密切關係的棕樹呢！他領着到中庭去　叩，玉立亭亭，看來還很為今日南洋醫院的院樹，倘使再加一些紀念的點綴，不是更會給人以景仰與希望的心情嗎？</p>
<p>說起南洋醫院却也有其自己的光榮的往史。還是在民國初年，民族及民主革命，表面上雖稱成功，然而實際上却出現了軍閥紛爭的局面，一時有志之士，灰心失望，有的準備新的革命事業，有的專心於社會改造事業。其中就頗有一些人物，本「不為良相，當為良醫」，的古訓，努力為中國　穎「東亞病夫」的恥辱，當時就有從留學愛如醫大畢業囘國　的顧南羣醫師，為了培養新醫人材而創辦南洋醫學專門學校，並為便利學生麻木實習起見，附設病院，原名南洋醫學專門學校實　醫院，前稱　洋醫院，還是民國七年的　，當時院址設在卡德路。後來因為學校與醫院兩部事業逐漸發連，民國八年遷山海關路，民國九年遷小南門，到了民國十四年，因為病院　分病人人數激增，院務日繁，為恐顧院劃分，學校部分，另委賢能的專家負責辦理。到了民國廿一年春，以院務發遠，並在剛陽構設分院，在新開河股診所。這年冬天，又租得小東門的座巨　，為適應發展需要及符合理想的新院所，並將南陽　分院及新開河　所歸併，分科診治。同時努力於醫療設備之充實，至民國廿三年秋置辦Ｘ光綫機，附設高級議士職業學校，廿四年冬又在養家渡設立分院‘逐潮成為上　最新型和完善的醫院了</p>
<p>可是，民國廿六年的上海戰役，把這十多年慘淡經營規模大備的南洋醫院化為灰樓，僅僅沒有把命院上下一致服務社會的決心燬滅，因此，他們立刻在辣斐德路三八〇號為臨時院會，繼續仁心仁術的社會事業，第二年三月就標租這所尙賢堂大厦及其東側住，宅改造為新聞的醫院，從六月一日起遷入開診。在積極經營之下，院務又發達起來，求診者紛至沓來，窮於應付，因自民國廿八年開始翻造住宅房　，至三十年一月建築工程完竣，裝修設備也先後成功，同時注力於醫務·士。總務各部的大整刷，一面改善醫療行政及制度，一面提高醫師學銜水準，緊强醫務陣容到了今年六月間，即以形式內容並　完善的現代化大醫院的英姿，煥然　峙於洛陽路上了。這裏人們給可以　楚地看出，顧南軍醫師為上海南洋醫院　門，巳二十多年；但至今長　該院依舊日求新異，豈僅他個人的成就啊。</p>

        <h1>1943.12.18</h1>
<h3>Responsibility for the Sinking of the Huatai Steamer</h3>
<p>The Huatai steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this city sank in the Xin'gang [New Port] river area on the 9th of this month. Of the more than one thousand passengers and crew, only about two hundred and fifty were rescued. The remaining three-quarters or more were buried in the bellies of fish. This is truly a tragedy unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<p>Regarding the cause of the Huatai steamer's sinking, the company side blamed the passengers for not maintaining order, rushing on board before all the passengers had disembarked. As a result, passengers coming and going were concentrated on one side of the ship, causing it to tilt. Water poured in through the portholes with great force, and it was impossible to stop it. According to the accounts of passengers who escaped, most of the passengers on the ship were "single-carry" merchants. The goods they carried were piled on the highest deck. They were not allowed to enter the cabins until the crew had negotiated terms and received fees. Thus, the top was heavy and the bottom light, causing the ship to tilt and capsize. However, the navigation authorities stated that the main reason for the ship's capsizing was that the load exceeded the prescribed limit by more than double. Furthermore, the crew did not follow the regulations and were not inspected. There may also have been negligence in driving and management. Combining the statements from these three sides and analyzing them, the issue of responsibility can be roughly understood.</p>
<p>That the passengers did not maintain order, rushing on board before all the passengers had disembarked, causing the passengers coming and going to be concentrated on one side of the ship, thereby losing its center of gravity and eventually capsizing and sinking, may be the company's excuse, but it may also be the truth. Because not maintaining order and rushing ahead is a deeply ingrained bad habit of our countrymen. This phenomenon can be seen at any time in front of train stations, tram stations, post offices, and rice shops. Especially recently, with the shortage of ships and the increase in "single-carry" merchants, crowding and disorder are even more expected. If the sinking of the Huatai steamer was indeed caused by this reason, we hope that after this lesson, the general public will be able to strictly maintain order at all times and in all places, benefiting others and themselves.</p>
<p>As for the accounts of the escaped passengers, we believe they are closer to the truth. In recent years, among the service personnel of transportation agencies, only a few do not exploit and oppress passengers. Moreover, the navigation bureau limited the Huatai steamer's passenger capacity to only five hundred and thirty-eight people, while the crew reached two hundred. If they did not exploit passengers and squeeze out fees, how would these two hundred people maintain their livelihoods? From this perspective, piling passengers' goods on the deck and negotiating prices item by item before allowing them into the cabins is not only imaginable but also inevitable. On this point alone, it is already clear that the China Merchants Company cannot shirk responsibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two other points for which the China Merchants Company cannot shirk responsibility. First, before the Huatai steamer had the accident in Xin'gang, it had already run aground on the Changyinsha river area due to the negligence of the driver and unfamiliarity with the route. The whole ship nearly suffered an accident. The drivers are entrusted with the lives of all the passengers on board. What a great responsibility! Why did the company assign personnel unfamiliar with the route to be drivers? The navigation bureau has repeatedly ordered that the company's crew members be inspected, why did the company not comply? Second, the navigation bureau has stipulated that the passenger limit for the Huatai steamer is five hundred and thirty-eight people. Why did the company exceed the limit and carry more than double the number of passengers? How will the company explain this fact?</p>
<p>In addition, we also believe that the navigation authorities are not without dereliction of duty. It has long been a common phenomenon for ships to carry passengers beyond the limit. The Huatai steamer's carrying passengers beyond the limit was definitely not a one-time occurrence. The navigation bureau should have corrected this earlier so that this kind of major tragedy would not have occurred. As for the inspection of crew members, since it is stipulated by the Ministry order, it should be strictly enforced, and the company should not be allowed to delay compliance. If the limit can be exceeded at will, and the crew members can be exempted from inspection, wouldn't the laws and regulations be equivalent to empty words, and the navigation bureau be equivalent to a nominal institution? Then why do we have these laws and regulations, and why do we have this institution?</p>
<p>Finally, our suggestion is that the chaos in the current transportation order is mainly due to the lack of smooth exchange of goods and materials, and the number of "single-carry" merchants is increasing day by day. We believe that to maintain transportation order, we must first start with facilitating the flow of goods and materials and clearing out the "single-carry" merchants. This is also the greatest responsibility of the controlling authorities.</p>
<h3>The Spirit and Aspirations of the Greater East Asia Must Be Realized Universally Throughout the Region: Konoe on the Profound Significance of the Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Prince Fumimaro Konoe, since resigning from office and residing in seclusion, has not published his political views for a long time. Recently, he suddenly wrote an article titled "On the Greater East Asia Declaration," published in the December issue of the "China" magazine published by the East Asia Tongwen Society. In it, he painstakingly explained the original intention of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese alliance, and strongly advocated that the great spirit of promoting Asia must be universally realized throughout East Asia. This is Prince Konoe's first formal expression of views as a private citizen and is worthy of attention. The full text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The "Greater East Asia Joint Declaration" resolved by the representatives of China, Japan, Thailand, Manchuria, the Philippines, and Burma at the Greater East Asia Conference held on November 6 of this year and announced to the world is a non-extinguishing torch lit in the history of mankind and has an eternal commemorative value. There is no one who should not be inspired. The five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, and economic prosperity articulated in the Declaration are not only the guiding principles for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere but also the foundation for establishing world peace. Therefore, in the history of the entire world, it can be said to open a new era. The significance of the Declaration is entirely based on the spirit of Hakkō ichiu. The Declaration begins by stating: "To enable all countries in the world to find their proper place, help each other, and share the joy of universal prosperity is the fundamental key to establishing world peace." This point alone is sufficient to prove the above-mentioned facts. The grand ideal of Hakkō ichiu, as it appears in Greater East Asia, is to "build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality." When this matter is materialized, it may be "mutual respect for autonomy and independence, and the result of mutual assistance and harmony, to achieve the amity of Greater East Asia," or it may be "mutual respect for their traditions, and the extension of the creativity of various ethnic groups," to "enhance the culture of Greater East Asia," or it may be "close cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, and the promotion of economic development," to increase "the prosperity of Greater East Asia." In this way, the countries of Greater East Asia can live in harmony with all countries, eliminate racial discrimination, promote cultural exchanges, and further develop resources to contribute to the progress of the world. Amidst this unprecedentedly severe war, the publication of this great Declaration has profound significance and cannot be overstated. However, the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is China, Japan, and Manchuria. The direction of China and Japan has a great impact on the fate of the entire Greater East Asia war. For China and Japan, since the establishment of the Chinese National Government in Nanjing, a completely new appearance has emerged. From the relationship of "sharing joys and sorrows" as described by Chairman Wang Jingwei, they have gone a step further, regarding "sharing life and death" as the spirit and jointly shouldering the fate of rise and fall. Since the Republic of China declared war on January 9 of this year, China and Japan have jointly declared their determination and belief to completely defeat the Anglo-American countries, and they have decided to fully cooperate in military, political, and economic aspects. We are still fresh in our minds about this matter. Subsequently, Japan gradually returned all the exclusive concessions in China or recognized the recovery of the Shanghai and Xiamen public concessions and the Peiping Legation Quarter, and further implemented the abolition of extraterritoriality laws. This has further consolidated the friendship between China and Japan. Since the revolution, the autonomy and independence that the Republic of China has long desired has now been formally completed. The political power of the National Government and the civil power of the people of the Republic of China have been further enhanced, reaching the dawn of restoring the five thousand years of glorious culture. This is truly worthy of celebration for our Asian compatriots. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was established on October 30 of this year, with the two countries mutually respecting their autonomy and independence, closely cooperating to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, and contributing to world peace. This is to fulfill the mission of the Axis powers that was pledged before the Greater East Asia Declaration and has attracted the unanimous attention of the world. Japan has established a close cooperative relationship based on morality with Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines, recognized the independence of the Indian government and the political participation of the southern residents, and on the one hand, has established an alliance with China. This is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, but the world may distort or fail to understand this great ambition and ideal, or think that this matter is difficult to realize in practice, which is prone to cause obstruction. We express our deep regret for this kind of rumor. We would like to take this opportunity to make great efforts to clarify the original intention of the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance. At the same time, we hope to launch a large-scale movement for this spirit of promoting Asia so that the tens of millions of people in East Asia can gain a deep understanding.</p>
<h3>Tokyo to Build Greater East Asia Reception Hall</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The former Tokyo Prefecture purchased the former residence of Prince General Kawagoe in Shibuya Ward within the camp area to build a Martial Arts Hall to commemorate the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire. However, with the change of Tokyo into a metropolis, the authorities decided to use this as a place for joint training by various ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it was decided to change this into the Greater East Asia Reception Hall and a walkway and training ground. It is now being actively repaired and will soon be completed. According to reports, the area covers a total of 12,773 tsubo, and the building area is 1,281 tsubo. All kinds of buildings are extremely luxurious and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Thai Parliament Passes Next Year's Budget: Revenues and Expenditures Both Increase Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Thai Parliament passed next year's budget on the 16th. The expenditures are 339,741,000 baht, including 183,000,000 baht for general expenditures and 151,448,300 baht for investment accounts. This is an increase of 280 million baht in expenditures and 141 million baht in revenues compared to this year's budget (including supplementary budget). In particular, general expenditures increased by 30 million baht compared to last year's 150 million baht. Due to the increase in expenditures, it is necessary to increase revenues and adopt measures such as issuing public bonds to make up for the deficit. Regarding tax increases, there is a tendency to gradually increase income tax, property tax, and various other taxes. In addition, the government is planning to raise tariff rates and collect sand tax, single tax, food and entertainment tax, and other new taxes. The revenue for next year can indeed be increased to offset general expenditures. In order to offset investment account expenditures, public bonds will be issued. Due to the implementation of the "Special Temporary Funds Statistics Law" previously passed by the parliament, the deposits of banks and credit institutions that purchase public bonds according to the regulations on public bonds and the increase in savings of the general public, it will not be difficult to absorb 120 million baht of public bonds. Therefore, Thailand's finances can still maintain their soundness.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Leverages National Power with the Implementation of Citizen Handbooks: Identification Cards Facilitate Rationing of Supplies</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to ensure the clear identification of every citizen, leverage the total power of the nation, and ensure the smooth operation of national administration, the Manchurian government formulated the "Citizen Handbook Implementation Guidelines" this spring and is rapidly preparing to promulgate the "Citizen Handbook Law." This law was passed by the Privy Council meeting on the 17th and will be implemented from January 1st next year. This handbook system is not only the basis for determining national mobilization, planning labor administration systems, and other national policies, but can also prove the identity of workers. Anyone holding a handbook can receive various materials and has other various conveniences. The recipients of the handbook are as follows: Except for military personnel, all those residing within the areas determined by the Minister of General Affairs. Those subject to military service or those who have been determined to be conscripted but have not yet enlisted. Civil defense, labor service, public service personnel, and volunteers for civil labor service. Those who must be registered according to the occupational registration laws. Those engaged in forestry, fisheries, mining, industry, civil engineering, and transportation industries, and laborers in businesses designated by the Prime Minister of the General Affairs Office.</p>
<h3>Amended Bills for North China Development and Central China Revitalization Companies: Formally Passed by the Japanese Cabinet Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese government recently made preparations for the bills to be submitted to the 84th Imperial Diet and submitted the "Outline of the Revised Laws in the North China Development Company Law and the Central China Reconstruction Company Law" at the routine cabinet meeting on the 17th. The eight points were formally decided and announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 PM: Outline of the Revised Laws in the North China Development Company Law and the Central China Reconstruction Company Law: For businesses necessary for the Japanese government on the road to the Greater East Asia War, it can stipulate the provision of funds for the North China Development Company and the Central China Reconstruction Company, the construction of facilities, and other necessary matters. Regarding the orders that have already been implemented, the company or the Central China Reconstruction Company, in addition to the authorities under the current law, can manage necessary businesses in order to implement the orders. The limit on bond issuance has been increased from five times the paid-in capital to ten times.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wartime Economy Is Becoming Stronger: Conversation with Finance Minister Kaya</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Osaka Telephone, Japanese Finance Minister Kaya held a banquet here at noon on the 16th to entertain financial figures. During the banquet, he delivered a speech explaining how Japan's economic power is becoming stronger under wartime conditions. The main points are as follows: The results of this year's public bond absorption are very good. From the beginning of the year to the end of November, in eight months, tax revenue alone reached more than 9.8 billion yuan. Compared with the issuance of 10.8 billion yuan of public bonds, 95% of the public bonds issued have been absorbed. In addition, there is approximately 3 billion yuan in stock revenue and approximately 1.8 billion yuan in new corporate bond issuance. Japan's decisive battle policies are progressing very smoothly. Regarding national savings, such as postal savings and various other savings, there has been a significant increase. The amount of national savings in the first half of this year is estimated to have reached more than 13.7 billion yuan, accounting for 59% of the annual target of 27 billion yuan. The total amount of national savings since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War until the end of September of this year is estimated to be approximately 86.7 billion yuan, and it is now feared that it has exceeded 90 billion yuan. The total amount of the general budget estimate for fiscal year 1944, decided on the 10th of this month, is more than 15.3 billion yuan, and the supplementary budget for temporary military expenses will also be quite large. Most of this increased finance must rely on taxes and public bonds. Regarding taxes, a tax increase bill will be submitted to the regular Diet. The amount of tax increase will exceed the additional budget. The amount of public bonds issued (required) including the general accounting and temporary military expenses will also be greater than this year. It is also estimated that the need for funds to expand production will also be considerable. Currently, the only way to meet these large financial and industrial demands is to increase national savings.</p>

<h3>Conserving Electricity to Cultivate War Power: Sino-Japanese Council in Nanjing Decides on Measures</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - As the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive phase, we should devote all materials to cultivating war power in order to complete the war. In this regard, a joint Sino-Japanese council was held in Nanjing on the 17th, and the content of the agreement included the following points:</p>
<p>Recently, the amount of fuel for electricity and lighting has been reduced by about 30% since November. This is not because coal production has decreased, but to preserve resources and use them for war power. The raw materials for Nanjing's electricity have been reduced by 30%. If the use of electricity and lighting does not decrease, power supply will be suspended for the last ten days of the month. Therefore, in order to complete this war objective, both China and Japan should conserve electricity. Japanese residents have been implementing electricity conservation since December. "The military has issued orders twice to remove unnecessary lighting fixtures and replace them with smaller light bulbs where necessary. The 100,000 citizens of Nanjing should also implement this immediately, but in the future, countermeasures need to be requested to find ways to save 30% to 45% of electricity. In the future, when large-scale power saving is implemented, the security and public order in Nanjing will inevitably be affected to some extent, and the citizens will also feel quite inconvenient. However, if we recognize the true meaning of the facts, there will be no anxiety or inconvenience. Some may think that saving electricity will affect industrial production and refuse to save electricity. However, according to expert surveys, Japan implemented electricity saving of up to 30%, and the results were as effective as before the reduction, and even achieved higher efficiency. The electrical machinery and electricity used in China are lower. Reducing it by 30% is not a problem at all. Electric heaters consume more electricity than ordinary electric lights, so it is necessary to avoid using them as much as possible. Based on the above agreement, the following policies are decided: Stipulate electricity saving propaganda and thoroughly publicize it to the public. Thoroughly investigate those who hoard small candle-type light bulbs, strictly crack down on them, and find ways to transport in small candle-type light bulbs. At a certain time, order the prohibition of selling electric water heaters, electric irons, and other electric heating products. Actively strengthen the inspection of electricity theft and crack down on it. Those who steal electricity and do not cooperate with electricity saving will be completely cut off from supply.</p>

<h3>General Takahashi of Japan Expresses Determination to Win; Delivers Speech at Sino-Japanese Press Conference</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – Naval Elder General Takahashi of Japan, at a reception held yesterday (17th) by the press department of the Japanese fleet in China, met with the Sino-Japanese press corps, expressing Japan's determination to win and detailing the current combat situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visit and Inspection</p>
<p>His Excellency Takahashi first stated: I hope to see the solidarity between China, Japan, and Manchuria strengthened through this East Asia Conference, with the three nations forming a united front to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. My task this time is to first earnestly discuss matters with various Chinese figures in Peiping and Tianjin, aiming to promote and establish future East Asian groups, and to promote exchanges between East Asian entities. I am ashamed to admit that my abilities are inadequate. I have never been to Peiping and Tianjin before, and this is my first visit. At the same time, I will also go to Kalgan, Baotou, Zhangjiakou and other places to conduct on-site inspections. I serve as an advisor to the Japan East Asia General Headquarters. In the past, I was unable to understand the real situation in Peiping, Tianjin, and other places. This time, I personally went to observe and gained results, which makes me quite satisfied. Currently, the Japan East Asia General Headquarters is under the jurisdiction of the Great Political Assistance Council. The Director General is Mr. Mizuno, the former Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Education. The advisors are Lieutenant General Matsui Ishine, Mr. Nagamori Kakutaro, the former Minister of Colonial Affairs, and myself.</p>
<p>Current War Situation</p>
<p>His Excellency Takahashi expressed his views on the current war situation in Greater East Asia, saying that since the start of the Greater East Asia War two years ago, the progress and state of the battles have been clear to everyone. From January to November of this year, the frontline battles, such as Guadalcanal and the Aleutian Islands, were fierce. The tragic and great martyrdom of the Yamazaki unit on Attu Island caused great pain and damage to the enemy. Next, the Japanese army achieved a major victory on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. Regarding the landing of several U.S. troops on Bougainville Island, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack and encirclement, achieving a great victory. Furthermore, the battles on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands were extraordinary. After winning a major victory on these two islands, this mentality was completely eliminated. Therefore, these two air battles are of great significance. However, the concerns of the general public about the future of the war are a fact. However, the general public needs to understand the situation in the vast Pacific Ocean and the different nature of land operations. This point should also be particularly clear.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses Suffered by the Enemy</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of naval warfare is to annihilate the enemy fleet and establish air base strongholds on the islands, using them to destroy the enemy fleet. Observing the process of the U.S. military's operations, the United States launched operations on Guadalcanal, Attu Island, and New Georgia Island, and then created new bases in several locations. Each time it attempted to move, it launched large-scale battleships and destroyers. Therefore, the damage suffered by them is well known to everyone. In short, the means used by the U.S. Navy will ultimately fail to achieve its intended purpose and will suffer heavy losses. Therefore, although they seize value, the value and significance of the islands occupied by our side are obviously far greater. From this perspective, our side is extremely advantageous. Therefore, based on factual observations and judgments, we are not concerned about the enemy's intentions and are quite secure in our defense.</p>
<p>Observing the Future</p>
<p>Next, observing the future prospects of the war, it is extremely difficult to predict the future of the war. It is still impossible to predict what the enemy will do. I would like to point out two important points. Firstly, I predict that the future war will be a long-term war. Secondly, no matter how long the future war is extended, victory will definitely belong to Japan. There are many reasons for a long-term war. In naval warfare, Japan has unwavering confidence. Thinking of the situation during the Russo-Japanese War, there is even more certainty. During the Russo-Japanese War, there were no submarines or aircraft. Japan used miraculous weapons to destroy the enemy's main battleships. Therefore, recalling the past and predicting the future, Japan will definitely achieve victory, displaying great combat power. First, aircraft are the main force at sea. In this war, no matter how the enemy plots, we will shatter the U.S. plan with our past strength and future attacks. It takes two or three years to build a warship, but aircraft can be completed in a short period of time. Japan has a vast air force that can destroy enemy ships. This is a war that benefits Japan's agility. Second, observing the reasons for a long-term war, the international situation during the Russo-Japanese War was different from the present. At that time, it was a war between Japan and Russia, but now it is the Greater East Asia War, with a wider scope. Furthermore, during the Russo-Japanese War, there were people who mediated, but now there is no one to mediate. Therefore, the current war is entirely fought on strength and will undoubtedly be a long-term war. The above is my personal judgment on the long-term war.</p>
<p>Victory in Spirit</p>
<p>Then, I will reveal that Japan's strength can win this war, and Japan will overcome it with material and spiritual courage. This is Japan's only strength. Regarding this point of view, the enemy relies on material things, while Japan wins with spirit and technological power. Although the United States also has spirit and technological power, it is ultimately not as good as Japan. General Takahashi specifically mentioned the following four key factors in comparing the manpower of the two countries: The mobilization of university students and other students into the army and navy shows that the United States is mobilizing those over the age of twenty, which shows that the United States lacks manpower. On the other hand, Japan only recently began to train university students in military affairs. At the same time, it has formed women's armies. Therefore, in terms of military strength and manpower, Japan's manpower is always more abundant than that of the United States. Based on the above judgments, it can be seen that the United States is extremely panicked about manpower. Furthermore, in terms of resources and materials, such as warships, aircraft, and other things, Japan has sufficient production, sufficient equipment, and rapid growth, which fully supplies the needs of the army and navy. The rear production provides ample supplies. Therefore, in terms of manpower and resources, Japan is extraordinarily abundant and confident that it will never lose to the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese Advantage</p>
<p>Regarding scientific issues, before the Greater East Asia War, the United States had electronic wave detectors and civil engineering disciplines, working hard in obscurity. Now, it has progressed rapidly and surpassed its past achievements. Therefore, it is certain that Japan is no worse than the United States in scientific warfare. In comparing the spirits of Japan and the United States, I am confident that we are above the United States, which need not be repeated. The spiritual power of Japan has already been demonstrated to the world in this war. Regarding the issue of technical power, after the Washington Conference, in the first World War, Japan and Britain were allies and were forced to declare war on Germany. At that time, the Japanese Navy replaced the British Navy in defending the Pacific Ocean, displaying great spirit. Britain had only a few cruisers, and all its strength was concentrated in its own country. Therefore, Japan not only defended the Pacific Ocean but also bore the responsibility of defending the Indian Ocean. The base at that time was in Singapore, now known as Syonan Island. Britain was not satisfied with its desires and repeatedly requested greater assistance from Japan. Later, it concentrated its naval power in Malta, creating another base. In the first World War, Britain defeated Germany because Japan and Britain won together. Shortly after the war, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan held a military reduction conference. At the conference, Britain and the United States arbitrarily suppressed Japan. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance treaty was declared invalid due to Britain's rejection, and Japan was forced to reduce its military, to a ratio of 5:3 with the United States. At that time, the representatives present were dissatisfied, but due to the situation in Japan and various relationships, they swallowed their anger and recognized it. In the next two or three years, Japan endured everything to abide by the treaty. Under these circumstances, the United States sank unfinished warships, and Japan sank its completed second-rate battleships Katori, Settsu, Aki, Satsuma, and more than a dozen others. Japan shed tears at this situation, enduring the sacrifice while feeling heartbroken for the naval cadets. However, even though Japan was suppressed during the military reduction, it remained steadfast in its belief, determined that one day, Japan would go to war with Britain and the United States and would not stop until it achieved a great victory. Therefore, at that time, with the determination to overcome inferiority and to defeat the majority with the few, it worked hard with all its strength. Marshal Togo stated that there are "limitations on the number of ships, but no limitations on training." Although the number of Japanese ships was small, its spiritual strength and training were not defeated. In the following ten years, the Japanese military's fierce training did not cease, which is why it achieved this effect, not hesitating to sacrifice one warship to exert the power of two or three, and using one aircraft to exert the power of five or ten. This great power of one against ten and one hundred against a thousand was fully demonstrated in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, Japan's strength surpasses that of Britain and the United States. In particular, the front-line soldiers and the rear civilians are becoming more and more prosperous, and their confidence is becoming even stronger. Victory in the Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly belong to Japan.</p>
<p>Spiritual Mobilization</p>
<p>General Takahashi finally added that the Japanese army's combat power is the same as the navy's. In the Japanese rear, the entire nation will cooperate with the front-line soldiers, promote that spirit, unanimously engage in spiritual mobilization, firmly believe, and strive for final victory. The victory in this war does not only belong to Japan alone, but to the people of China, Manchuria, Burma, and the various ethnic groups in East Asia. In other words, East Asia, which has suffered oppression for many years, has been restored to the East Asians through this war. Asia has been restored to the Asians. He said that during his visit to Manchuria, North China, and Central China, he saw that the people in various places were taking the same steps as Japan, working diligently, and contributing to the Greater East Asia War. He felt very gratified about this. He respectfully wishes that the people of the Republic of China would be of one heart and one mind, unite and strive for the complete success of the East Asia War. He eagerly anticipates this. Therefore, in this spirit, everyone must strive hard and believe that the war will be successful. He can assert that the Greater East Asia War will never fail, and he hopes that all of China will firmly believe that Japan will definitely achieve victory. With this belief, the future will be favorable. As members of the press, fulfill your heavenly duty of reporting and spread the message widely.</p>

<p>German and French Yarn and Cloth Approved for Exemption from Purchase</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office of the National General Association for Commercial Control has actively launched the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth nationwide. It has conducted cotton yarn and cloth registration in nine cities including Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu. The entire task has largely come to an end. As for merchants of third-country nationality (excluding Japanese) holding cotton yarn and cloth, they were originally required to follow the purchase procedures as well. However, most of the cotton yarn and cloth owned by French merchants in Shanghai were ordered by Annam before the Greater East Asia War, but due to difficulties in maritime transportation, they could not be shipped out. It is said that the French residents requested the Commercial Control Association to exempt them from purchase, which has been approved by the association. However, if the cotton yarn and cloth are sold in Shanghai, the Commercial Control Association should have the priority to purchase them. The quantity of special cotton yarn and cloth owned by Germans is very small, only 0.05 percent of the total. They requested exemption from purchase, which has been approved by the Commercial Control Association.</p>
<h3>Loss of the Huatai Steamer; Company Studies Aftermath; Five County Associations Form Assistance Association</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – Regarding the accident of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Huatai steamer sinking at the entrance of the Xingang River, with more than a thousand passengers tragically drowning, this reporter interviewed Mr. Yamamoto, the vice president of the company, yesterday afternoon. The conversation lasted for one hour, and the details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Question) The cause of the Huatai steamer accident and the company's handling of the aftermath are of great concern to all sectors of society. We hope you can explain. (Answer) According to reports, the Huatai steamer had 459 passengers apart from the crew when it departed from Shanghai. Later, it picked up more than two hundred passengers along the way. The time of arrival at Xingang was 7:30 AM. The sky was not completely bright, and in the faint morning light, more than thirty sampans were parked in front of the Huatai, waiting for the Huatai to arrive. Passengers in the sampans then wanted to board the ship. At that time, passengers disembarking from the Huatai had not completely disembarked, causing the ship's body to tilt excessively to one side. River water entered the deck and cabin doors, causing it to sink, resulting in the tragedy. The company expresses its sincere apologies. It immediately organized a committee and dispatched the Xuchang ship overnight to investigate and search for the remaining corpses in the cabin. It also sent fifteen divers to the accident site to start work a few days ago. It is also scheduled to accompany the affected families to Xingang on the Xin Yuan boat today at 2 pm. As for the aftermath, the company is currently studying it as much as possible. (Question) It is also heard that when the Huatai steamer had an accident, it closed the cabin doors tightly, and some of the ship's employees and servants used extortion, forcing passengers to give money before letting them descend from the ship, resulting in a large number of passengers being unable to escape the ship and tragically drowning. Is this true? (Answer) It is true that the lower cabin doors were closed when the ship had an accident to slow the flow of river water. At the same time, personnel were sent to climb onto the ship from outside to rescue people. As for the crew using extortion, it is unlikely to have happened, but it cannot be ruled out. (Question) I heard that your company has sent fifteen divers to the accident site to search for the remaining corpses in the cabin. If the divers discover valuable items near the bodies of drowned passengers when diving, will the company consider a plan to deal with the above situation? (Answer) The company will conduct strict inspections of the divers before and after entering the water to prevent illegal behavior.</p>
<p>Registration of Affected Families</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Huatai steamer sank at Xingang Port in Rugao County, with no fewer than a thousand people tragically drowned. Among them, peddlers from Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong accounted for the majority. The affected families, driving in the past, have gathered at the Bund Jianghai Customs Pier in this city for days, wailing and crying, which is too painful to bear. The Tong Rugao Changhai Qidong Five County Association in this city believes that the victims of this unfortunate event are mostly fellow villagers, so it feels the pain personally. Therefore, it held an emergency standing director meeting on the 17th of this month, resolving to organize a Huatai Steamer Victims Assistance Committee. It appointed Ni Bu-chang, Qian Xia-xiang, Qiang Xi-qi, Zhang Tong-sheng, Ji Jiu-yu, Lu Ting-zhu, and He Tian-jiong as members. It immediately announced in the newspaper that the affected families should go to the association's office at Room 29, 4th Floor, Beijing Road Trade Building, to register. It is also scheduled to hold the first Assistance Committee meeting on the 18th to prepare for various assistance matters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Elder General Takahashi Arrives in Shanghai; Meets with Sino-Japanese Journalists in This City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Japanese Naval Elder General Takahashi, who is visiting various places in Central and North China, transferred to Shanghai. The press department of the Japanese fleet in China, taking advantage of General Takahashi's visit to Shanghai, introduced and met with Sino-Japanese newspaper reporters at the Hua Hotel outside Nanjing Road yesterday (17th) at 3 PM. Fleet press director Colonel Matsushima, subordinate Captain Morita, and entrusted Sakazume, Anchi, and Wang Bing-kun to receive General Takahashi at the meeting on time. No fewer than forty Sino-Japanese reporters attended the meeting. First, Director Matsushima introduced and delivered a speech, roughly saying: "Today, we are hosting the Sino-Japanese press corps here and welcoming Naval Elder General Takahashi to meet with everyone. General Takahashi has a long history in the Japanese Navy and has a clear understanding of the current stage of operations. Today, we are inviting the journalists in this city to meet with him and listen to General Takahashi's high opinions and instructions. I believe it is a great honor, and I think everyone feels the same. The victory that Japan has achieved in the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a triumphant opening, which is also the result of his many years of painstaking efforts, courageous spirit, and cultivation of talent. General Takahashi has served as the commander-in-chief of the former Combined Fleet and the former president of the Naval War College. His great achievements in diligently preparing and serving the country for many years are worthy of introduction to everyone." Then, General Takahashi delivered a speech, briefly reporting on the mission of this visit to China and the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, and revealing Japan's determination to win this war. Finally, he bitterly criticized the Anglo-American oppression of Japan at the Washington Conference [please see page 2]. At the end, Director Matsushima expressed his thanks, roughly saying: "Today, we have obtained General Takahashi's valuable high opinions in this precious time, for which I am very grateful. When I was studying at the Naval War College, Your Excellency was the president, and I received profound guidance. Today, I have once again received your valuable high opinions, which I consider to be very fortunate. According to Your Excellency's remarks just now, which can be said to be Your Excellency's long-held aspirations, Your Excellency based this on diligent training during the military reduction conference, which has produced many talents, and has resulted in today's achievements. Therefore, Your Excellency's contribution can be called great. The greatest foundation of the navy has just been created, allowing us to gain a full understanding of it. We are especially grateful." It lasted about three hours and ended with tea and refreshments.</p>

<h3>Economic Section of the First District: Remarks by Director Feng</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Chen Riping, the Director of the Economic Section of the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, has resigned due to mourning the death of a parent. Mayor Chen has appointed Feng [blank space] to succeed him. The Director has already taken office. He issued a statement yesterday, saying... I have been appointed by the Mayor to handle the affairs of this section. I will certainly understand the Mayor's intentions and, under his guidance, work with all the senior officials of the Municipal Government to do my best within the scope of my duties. However, as this city is an important economic area of ​​China, various economic problems are extraordinarily complex. I am of limited talent and shallow knowledge. I hope that people from all walks of life and the citizens will provide assistance at any time so that the affairs under the management of this section can be further improved and can better meet the hopes of the general public in the district. The establishment of the Economic Section of the First District has been some time ago. It manages the allocation of materials in the first and eighth districts of the city and rectifies and suppresses economic affairs within its jurisdiction. It has already achieved considerable political achievements, which I greatly admired before joining the First District Public Office. For example, in the matter of material allocation, at the [blank space] stage of being able to allocate, the colleagues of the Economic Section must go through a lot of hard work and trouble in terms of negotiation, procurement, transportation, and storage before they can achieve the purpose of allocation. At this time of wartime material shortage, when [blank space] the need to increase production, handling it is even more difficult. In short, the wartime economy is different from the peacetime economy. In wartime, materials and labor are bound to feel scarce. In order to take care of the economic life of the public, the government has to rigorously implement economic control in order to seek fair and universal allocation, while striving to increase production and [blank space] to ensure smooth cargo transportation. However, before the above-mentioned goals can be fully achieved, inconvenience will inevitably be felt in life. I hope that the gentlemen of the press can understand the Municipal Government's painstaking efforts to improve the city's economy and explain it to the public. It would be very fortunate. In addition, regarding the personnel issues of the various sections of the Economic Section, all the staff have been diligent in their work in the past and are already experienced, so everything remains the same and there are no changes.</p>

<p>Economic Circles' Comments</p>
<h3>Restricting Capital Increases for Enterprises</h3>
<p>The Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Industry stated yesterday that the government will restrict the arbitrary capital increases of companies and factories in various regions. He explained that the use of investment must be coordinated with the development of various enterprises, otherwise it will inevitably lead to abnormal operations. Secondly, companies and factories that have been established for a long time have assets whose value is no longer what it used to be. Raising prices and increasing shares is naturally inappropriate. [blank space] If the asset appreciation ratio is not subject to considerable restrictions, and the price is allowed to be raised arbitrarily, once prices [blank space] flatten, the company's assets will superficially [blank space] retain [blank space] a large number, but the value of its shares has depreciated, and the company's foundation will also be shaken. Thirdly, the method of increasing shares also lacks legal basis.</p>
<p>The above paragraph can be said to be a preventive medicine for the unrestricted capital increases of general companies and factories. From the first point in the speech, it is in line with what Deputy Propaganda Minister Guo said in his broadcast a few days ago: "Some people, when they hear that the country is advocating production, also say that they are increasing production, but when it comes time to do it, they treat it as a game, and of course there will be no good results." From the second point [blank space], companies and factories must be cautious when raising prices and increasing shares to prevent excessive inflation of shares and avoid the danger of "being top-heavy" in the future. From the third point [blank space], the method of increasing shares, in the company's and factory's opinion, may be considered "everyone knows the tricks, but each has their own cleverness." However, the competent authorities should consider forming a most reasonable standard for everyone to follow.</p>

<h3>A Hospital on Luoyang Road: A Visit to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital</h3>
<p>From Luoyang Road (formerly Route Foch), from Nantong Road (formerly Rue Sapey), or from Taishan Road (formerly [blank space] Fei Road), you can see the grand and imposing gate of the "Shanghai Nanyang Hospital". From these three main gates of the hospital, can you guess the scale of the hospital? However, let's go inside and take a look. This is a hospital with a rich history and also a modern hospital. It is a large hospital that serves not only the wealthy but also the public, and it is a large hospital that not only engages in treatment but also cultivates new medical talents!</p>
<p>A Glorious History</p>
<p>The gate of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital at No. 77 Luoyang Road, in front of the new building, also stands an antique archway, which embellishes this as a historical medical institution.</p>
<p>Filled with the quiet and sublime atmosphere of a French aristocratic residence, the hospital is surrounded by small courtyards, but the palm trees that sweep into the clouds like giants are just like a song from the South. It seems that this is the origin of the name of Nanyang Hospital. However, Mr. Lu Ping of the hospital mentioned that there is also a palm tree here that has a close relationship with the Chinese revolution! He led [blank space] to the courtyard [blank space], where it stands tall and graceful. It seems that it is still the hospital tree of Nanyang Hospital today. If some commemorative embellishments are added, wouldn't it give people a more admired and hopeful mood?</p>
<p>Speaking of Nanyang Hospital, it also has its own glorious past. It was still in the early years of the Republic of China, when the national and democratic revolutions, although nominally successful, actually showed a situation of warlord strife. For a time, people with lofty ideals were discouraged and disappointed. Some were preparing for new revolutionary undertakings, and some were concentrating on social reform undertakings. Among them, quite a few people followed the ancient motto of "If I can't be a good minister, I will be a good doctor" and strived to rid China [blank space] of the shame of "sick man of East Asia". At that time, there was Dr. Gu Nanqun, who graduated from Ai Ru Medical University and returned to China. In order to cultivate new medical talents, he founded Nanyang Medical College, and for the convenience of students' numb practice, he attached a hospital, originally named Nanyang Medical College Practice [blank space] Hospital, formerly known as [blank space] Yang Hospital. It was still in the [blank space] of the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, the hospital was located on Carter Road. Later, because the two businesses of the school and the hospital gradually developed, it moved to Shanhai Pass Road in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and to Xiaonanmen in the ninth year of the Republic of China. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, because the number of patients in the hospital [blank space] increased sharply, the hospital affairs became increasingly busy. In order to prevent Gu Yuan from dividing, the school part was entrusted to capable experts to be responsible for the management. In the spring of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the hospital affairs developed far, and a branch was built in Gangyang, with a clinic at the New Kaihe section. In the winter of this year, it also rented a large [blank space] in Xiaodongmen. In order to meet the needs of development and conform to the ideal new hospital, it merged the Nanyang [blank space] Branch and the New Kaihe [blank space] Office, and divided them into departments for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, it strived to enrich the medical equipment. In the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, it purchased an X-ray machine and attached a senior parliamentary vocational school. In the winter of the twenty-fourth year, it also established a branch in Yangjiadu, gradually becoming the newest and most complete hospital in Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai battle in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China turned Nanyang Hospital, which had been painstakingly managed and scaled up for more than ten years, into ashes. It only did not destroy the determination of the hospital's staff to serve the society wholeheartedly. Therefore, they immediately used No. 380 Route Lafayette as a temporary hospital and continued the social undertaking of benevolence and medical skills. In March of the following year, they leased the Shangxian Hall Building and the house to its east and transformed it into a news hospital, and moved in for diagnosis and treatment from June 1st. Under active management, the hospital affairs developed again, and those seeking medical treatment came one after another, and they were exhausted to cope with it. Therefore, starting from the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, they renovated the residential building [blank space]. The construction project was completed in January of the thirtieth year, and the decoration and equipment were also successful one after another. At the same time, they focused on the medical and administrative affairs. The general affairs departments have undergone a major renovation, improving the medical administration and system on one hand, and improving the academic standards of doctors on the other, strengthening the medical lineup. By June of this year, they were standing in Luoyang Road with the perfect posture of a modern hospital that combines form and content. Here, people can see clearly that Dr. Gu Nanqun has been [blank space] at the gate of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital for more than twenty years; but to this day, the hospital is still seeking new innovations every day. Is it just his personal achievement?</p>
