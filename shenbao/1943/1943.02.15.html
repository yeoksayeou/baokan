<h3>確立戰時文化政策網領</h3>
<p>「總力參戰」已到了開始實踐的階段，必需要全國政治、經濟、文化一切部門的事業，都適應參戰的需要而完成戰時體制，以便集中一切人力、物力和智力，爭取鍛後勝利。現在政治方面的戰時體系，已經先後確定，和開始實施了。經濟方面，國防臨時會議已通過了「戰時經濟政策綱領」，而即將付諸實施。可是爲了貫澈政治上和經濟上的戰時政策綱領，我們更希望政府迅速縝密地確定戰時文化政策綱領。</p>
<p>文化是一國國力的最高表現，戰時文化更是國民「總力參戰」的推動機。在平時一國的盛衰興替，可於該國文化情形覘知之：在戰時，凡文化政策正確，文化運動活躍者，則其戰時一切政策及設施，也必然能爲人民所普遍了解與擁護，而能普遍地動員起民問一切動的和靜的力量，貫澈政策、政令，取得最後勝利。反之，如果不注軍戰時文化，如果沒有正確的戰時文化政策和切實的執行這種政策，那麼縱使有着完善的政治上經濟上的政策與戰時實施，實際上也難期其貫澈。</p>
<p>戰時文化政策綱領，其主要的任務是動員全國的人民，參加保衛東亞解放中國的戰鬥。因此，這個政策綱領，必須是積極性的建設性的，使中國文化水準的提高和發揚。特別是在目前中國，經過了六年聞長期的動盪和不安，文化事業早已陷於消沉停滯的狀態，所以今日的戰時文化政策綱領，首先必須是積極性的建設性的戰時文化政策綱領，多方面扶導國民文化事業，鼓勵和發揚民族文化，擴展文化部鬥的一切戰時設施，使全國人民進入嶄新的文化園地。在這園地裏，認識世界，認識時代，認識自己的祖國及其眞正的友敵，旋而自發自動的獻身爲國家爲東亞的解放事業而努力，這是確立戰時文化政策綱領的前提。</p>
<p>目前的戰爭，從國家的立塲來說，是反對英美奴役中國的戰爭，因此中國的戰時文化政策，主要的必須是適合於動員中國人民力量的文化政策，它必須是中國化的，特別爲中國大多數人民所能愛好，所能接受的文化政策。這是一。其次，在東亞民族的立塲上說，這决戰爭是東亞民族起來反抗和消滅英美帝國主義的侵略政策的戰爭，因此，戰時文化政策綱領必然具有東亞民族解放運動的特徴，具有反對英美帝國主義文化的特徴。我們要經過具有這樣特微的戰時文化政策綱領，來澈底淸算一百年來歐美殖民地經營政策，對於東亞各國民族所作的愚弄、麻醉、利用等等實際情形。同時積極地建立起保證東亞民族獨立解放的新文化，特別是對於中日兩國文化的研究和發揚，對於東亞各國民族文化的研究和發揚，在東亞各民族中建立起鞏固的文化戰錢。這是二。再從國際的立塲說，這次戰爭是消滅英美帝國主義系統的舊秩序的戰爭，其目的是在建立各國各民族互相扶助共謀發展的世界新秩序。因此，我們所希望的戰時文化政策綱領，一定是要具有這種新的時代意義和世界意義的文化政策。這是三。以上三者，是戰時文化政策綱領的基本原則。</p>
<p>有了前提和基本原則，我們再來談具體的內容，可分消極和積極兩方面來講。消極方面，自然是實行戰時文化統制：（一）對於人民言論，出版，著作，通訊，明白規定戰時限制的範圍和辦法，使人民和輿論機關有所遵循。（二）關於文化資材的消耗，應有嚴格和合理的管制，特別是紙張，油墨等等，對於一切無助於戰時國策和無益於社會民族文化的出版物應加以限制，關於非文化部門消耗文化資材，亦應作必要的限制。不過，我們特別要明瞭中國文化的貧乏，所以消極的限制，只是在萬不得已的塲合，才可偶一實施之，最要緊的是要積極的指導和培植，以建樹中國的戰時文化。</p>
<p>麼，在　極方面應該怎樣？第一，是要集中各方面的專門人才，在政府的正確領導之下，建立起一偭全國規模的文化戰綫。這是官民合作的文化大本營，其主要任務，是戰時文化政策的宣傳和執行，是戰時文化動員工作的推進。這不重要管制全國一切文化部門，文化事業和文化運動，而且更主要的是努力倡導戰時文化，發展國民文化事業，推進戰時文化運動和提高全國人民的文化水準。第二，在戰時文化政策網領中必須規定團結各方面文化界戰士的辦法，應切切實實的集中全國的力量來推進戰時文化運動和發展中國文化事業，提高人民文化水準。第三，是要大規模的培養戰時文化幹部的人才，大量的造成新中國文化車業的新軍。因此，中央文化研充最高機關的創立，國立文化幹部人才養成機關的設置，更是戰時刻不容緩的事業。這事不僅在目前，而且對於未來中國的建設，都有莫大的關係，不能不於今日愼重進行。第四，我們希望政府預算中有確定不移和相當多量的經費，以發展文化事業，推進文化運動，而社會上也要協力推進文化的獻金運動。道種經費，主要的用途應該規定：爲（一）普遍增設民衆圖書館，博物館，尤其是各國戰時生活展覽會，及一切適應戰時文化的展覽會等等。（二）補助民間文化事業，—報紙，雜誌，圖書館，出版公司等等，以推進文化運動，提高國民文化水準。而更迫切的是（三）鑒於目前文化人日常生活的艱苦，而以一定的經費，予以適當的補助，如普設研究院及專門學術獎助金等，使有志文人得安心從事文化學術的專攻：設置特種獎金，以給予文化上有頁獻的人士：尤其對於文化界人士的疾病與困難，也應設立負責的機關，隨時隨地予以協助。</p>
<p>文化是實現總力參戰的推動機，我們希望政府早定戰時文化政策綱領和切實地付諸實　。我們更期待社會各界尤其是文化界本身一致奮起，促其實現。</p>

<h3>戰時各國的國民生活觀（二）</h3>
<p>— 石井良一著　靜一譯</p>
<p>德·意·美·英·蘇</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>得天獨厚的美國，在食糧方面來說，因爲戰時　要的增加和對聯台國的供應，以及其他運輸關係，也就日感缺乏了。砂糖的消費，首先受到嚴重的限制，自十月九日起，每逢星期二不食肉，尤其是紐約，每週必須有二次不食肉。牛肉，羊肉的加工品，因爲船舶的關係，禁止輸入，這類必需物品，大约削减百分之二十，近且有施行配給證制度約計劃，白糖的分配量，因爲國內產糖，故祗减低约百分之三十左右而已。牛巴糖則因船舶關係，爪哇和菲列濱的糖？都不能輸入，故自去年五月四日起，已實行每人每週半磅的配給證制度。其他罐頭的靑菜，水菓等項，可以貯藏的食物，每年配給五磅。近來，咖啡也實行配給了，其他各項物資，也都逐漸地要受正當消費的規定。惟小麥一項，因生產過剩，即二年以內無生產，還能自給，因此尙有裕餘。不過食料品在整個來看，價格還是在高漲，故亦足以影響國民生計，因自十月五日起頒布停止食糧物價高漲命今；以九月二十八日至十月二日，五日問的最高價格爲標準，有效期問，暫定六十日。</p>
<p>衣料力面，尤其是羊毛，因爲來源不充裕，所以民開需用，幾乎全被禁止。現在用的，是混合絲微品，男女衣服的村料，都比校降低，所以人造絲，近來也非常盛行，襪子，因爲日本禁止生絲出境的關係，也就大加削弱。其他的物資，因爲樹膠不敷，所以禁止製造，民用小型汽車和卡車。膠鞋，也列入配給範圍之內，汽車的車輪（Tyre）不充俗，汽油也實行憑證制，石汕則用分配制。十一月以後，安全剃刀，打火機，自來水筆，粉鏡盒，以及各項架子等特殊日常用品，須使用鐵質者，均先後禁止製造。因爲屑鐵的需要增加，現在用不着的機械，也都高喊着搗毀的口號，最近一萬噸的紀念戰艦柯力芝號，也決定拆卸，以期獲得七千噸的屑鐵，同時蒐集私入所有的各種廢金屬品。一方面節省消費，以爲開關戰費之源泉。近日大事增稅，如香烟，啤酒及其他酒類等項消費稅，均一律增加，捲烟稅增加百分之二十，一元一瓶的啤酒，增加到二元五角，酒類由百分之二十二，增加到百分之五十五的高價。</p>
<p>煤炭也漸感不敷。去冬以來，即有實行節約燃料，較日常减低百分之二十五的傳說。住宅方面，在軍需工廠的地帶，大有住宅難之感，因此房屋租金亦隨之高漲，政府乃於十月五日，將租金限制？不准再漲，住宅內的其他設備，如鍋，釜之類規定約百分之六十的製造規格。由限制金屬品的製造來看，我們可以想像得到美國國民的住宅生活，已經是很困難了。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>英國的食糧問題，也日見深刻化了。現在的憑證分配數量，較之前年一月開始實行憑證制時，大體都已减少。若較戰前的消費量，則白糖减少百分之三十九，肉類百分之六十，燻肉，火腿，麥琪琳，百分之六十六·七，白塔油百分之五十二，乳酪百分之三十三，紅茶百分之六十六。而最近的分配量，每人每日是白糖三十二克，乳酪八克，白塔油三十二克，生豬油十五克，茶八克，牛肉七十三克，豬肉十六克。其中白糖的每月分配額約一·六斤，較之日本都會生活者，每月〇六斤的配給量，約爲三倍，但是一般英國國民日常消耗白糖非常之多，假如减到百分之四十左右的正規消　量的話，影饗固嫌太大，最近雖然仍保持這個分配制，然而事實上小容易買得到，以後當　要更困難起來。他如白塔汕，生豬油，水菓，肉類等，也都會變成　樣地買不到的困難。白塔油减少的最大原因，蓋由於世界惟一白塔油出產地新西籣，不能運輪出去的關係，水菓同樣地由於澳洲的產品運小來，此外米，荳類，乾麪，不久也要實行憑證制。惟麪包？牛乳，靑菜類，還沒有實行憑證制，不過麵包市上已經沒有了，牛乳自前年十月以後，即已實行統制，至於鷄蛋，每月不過兩三個而已。</p>
<p>普通的飯館或是大飲店裏，表面上是可以自由去吃的，惟每餐祗限於三　菜，至多不得超過五先令。因此現在第一流飯店的物品，非常缺乏，偶爾拿出一個乾了的橙子來擺在桌子上，大家都會認爲非常珍貴，不約而同地喝起采來。在這樣的狀態之下，食料品價値的騰貴，當然可以想見。政府爲抑制物價高漲起見，特撥款一憶四千萬金鎊，來辦理這件事，但是能抑制到什麽程度，還是個疑問。</p>
<p>衣料方面，如羊毛棉衣之類向由澳洲，新西蘭，南非洲和印度方面運來，現在已是不可能了。因此，在國民生活方面，大受打擊。當時爲節約計，每人每年配給六十六點的衣料憑證，後改爲六十點，今則更加縮减矣。衣服一套二十六點，鞋子五點，襯衫五點，襪子一點，汗衫三點，手巾一點，內褲三點。</p>
<p>其他的物資，例如缺乏鐵類，故而大事蒐集鐵質品，舉凡含有一定量鐵的成分的古董，器其之類，均行登記，禁止轉讓。三噸以上的現貨，全部徴發，現正作火規模的蒐集運動，以期達到一萬噸的數量，最近茵徴伯拉旁邊小學校裏的鐵窗格子，以及其他鐵質材料，幾乎完全拆卸，防空壕裏的鐵門，也陸續收回了，這樣缺乏鐵的情狀，也可以想像得到。此外金屬類如銅，鉛，亞鉛，錫，黄銅，白銅，鋁等的收回運勁，也實行了。</p>
<p>爲節省燃料與樹膠計，禁止用私人汽車，同時爲緩和輸送量的增加計，更於十月五日廢止各種遊電旅行的减價票。而去鄕問探視　難兒女的父母親的旅行次數，自去冬以來，也由六次减少到三次，近更有禁止經營長途汽車的傳說。家庭用的煤炭，實行登記，有違反者，即停止供給。燃料部去冬日有命令謂：冬季家庭煤炭消費分配量，减爲四百萬噸。自官廳始，以至於銀行，公司，戲劇塲等一律禁止十月間即用暖氣。今年則自十二月份起，始准用暖氣，戲劇塲，影戲院，商店亦一律提早關店時間</p>
<p>關於煤炭的缺乏問題，據英國經濟雜誌所載，預定是四千四百萬噸，除節約消費後，可以節省一千萬噸外，其餘的用增產的方法來彌補。惟煤鑛工人的罷工和停工之類的事件，日形擴大，故召集工人，也是一個非常困難的問題。政府雖打算在某種程度之下，將採鑛業收作國有，由政府管理，並允許工人要求提高工資，可是效果仍甚微。故民間對於政府由前綫召回服兵役的士兵，改服採鑛後的政策，以及其他政府種種措施，均予以極端的非難。政府不得已，乃動員十八歲以上，二十五歲以下的靑年，從事鑛業，以圖增加煤炭產量，同時動員新聞和廣播，努力宣傳節的燃料運動。因燃料的缺乏影響於戰事頗巨也。其他如紙類亦甚缺乏，所以减少新聞紙的張數，信封，居然有反轉來再用第二次的辦法。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>蘇聯主要食糧，如麵之類，似尙不成大問題，惟副食物品的供應較之戰前，就差得遠了，試由下表所列前年七月間各地實行的憑證制度的配給量來看，就可以知道了。</p>
<p>甲，代表筋肉勞働者和技術人員；</p>
<p>乙，代表一般從業員；</p>
<p>丙，代表主婦旅客；</p>
<p>丁，代表十二歲以下的兒童和老人。</p>
<p>麵包以一日爲單位，其他以一月爲單位。</p>
<p>截至現在止，麵包配給數量，雖則還未變動，可是殺物乾麵則减去了百分之四十，砂糖和點心類，减了百分之六十，白塔油和肉類（包括魚類）减了一半，但是這個數量，在事實上是常常買不到的。買食糧品的，照章是要到國營商店裏去，可是這裏常是一下就賣完了。跑到自由市塲裏去的話，在國營商店裏一啟羅的白塔油，祇須二十盧布即可買得到，而在這裏，則非七百盧布不可。其他母須憑證來購買的食糧，因爲在國營商店裏買不到，雖明知高價，也就不得不到自由市塲去購買。</p>
<p>服裝材料與食糧同時實行憑證制度，每人每半年發給配給券一次，其配給量，勞働者與技術人員二十五點，一般從業員一百點，兒童與老人及其他無一定職業者八十點，綿製品和絲織品，每一米突十點，皮鞋三十點，外衣及其他服裝類；毛織品爲八十點，棉織品則爲六十點，襯衫十點，到十二點，襪子二點，但衣服的製造差不多完全停止，故名義上雖有憑證，而實則等於零。惟蘇聯國民，在戰前關於這類物品，早有準備，現在馬虎用下去，也就可以了。</p>
<p>肥皂的分配量，每月香皂和洗滌皂各一只。此外紙類和洋火。都很缺乏。</p>
<p>煤炭也很成問題，自鄧樸斯煤鑛爲德國佔領之後，煤炭的缺乏，更見激化。因此煤炭分配量减少百分之六十，電力减少百分之三十。去冬以來，暖氣也即隨之减低。住宅方面：在自由區裏的都市，因避難人口的激增，也有着住宅難之感。西比利亞方面都市的人口，增加到兩倍，莫斯科居民之遷入內地者，明令其住宅須退讓他人居住，並禁止再行遷回。有些都市，且禁止去旅行，以緩和住宅難的問題。</p>
<p>以上僅就德，意，英，美，蘇五國的國民生活，略予申述而已。要之，在物資方面，均日形匱乏，國民生活到底要怎樣才能忍耐下去？我們須知道，在這非常時期中，無論如何，是要養成十足的忍耐力的，因爲這是我們整備國內體制，以期達到最後勝利的基礎！（譯自三十二年一月「物資」第六卷第一號）</p>

<h3>滿蘇國境巡禮　滿蘇國境辻隊員發　參加第一次關東軍報導演習記</h3>
<p>滿洲國為日本北邊的護衛，同時又爲食糧，鐵輕金屬等的供給地，爲完遂戰爭偉業而與日本中心協力。一月十六日在新京關東軍司令部集結的報道隊員三百名，自此日起，開始車隊的生活，一切起居動作，全以軍隊的行動爲基準。五天的準備教育終了後，於二十一日出發至滿蘇國境，出入於守護國境的當地各部隊最前綫的監視哨，具體視察其起居的狀況。記著爲第六班隊長，曾訪問黑河省國境方面最前綫的各部隊，因而獲知該方面守護的實情，此時適値恒塞期中最酷寒的時期，眺望河山，冰雪遍地，不禁湧起了無限的感慨。</p>
<p>寂寥國境風景綫</p>
<p>北滿的夜，月亮皎潔地照澈大地，防塞，靴踏着雪，發出茲茲的輕金屬的聲音。站立在被雪掩蓋了的〇〇河的北岸，向對岸眺望，對岸的市街，在明晃的月光下，沉寂地橫臥着，零下數十度的酷寒，使一切都凍結成冰雪般的死寂，　在左岸下流，有機閃電燈的光亮，似乎有人居住的模樣。永遠在流動中的黑龍江，是溶合了二千三百年來斯拉夫與東亞民族悠久鬥爭的歷史的河流，現在所看見的，僅是在　冰凍結下寂無聲息地流動着的一片灰白的冰雪，這就是寬八百公尺蜿蜒如帶的遙長的國境，在此國境綫上，雖沒有鐵刺網，但螞蟻也　不過一隻。</p>
<p>滿洲的夕陽，也如朝陽一般的血紅，對岸市街上，赤，白，青各色建築物的屋頂上，玻璃窗上，閃耀着陽光。高　的烟突中，一縷縷白烟，在寒風中裊動。在河岸邊的大道上，在白樺林的空隙中，似有車馬通過，除在冰上蹀　往來的巡邏兵三人以外，不見外人的影子。</p>
<p>三個無影的敵人</p>
<p>各部除對報道隊員款以上賓之禮。某部隊載肉陳酒用僅有的砂糖作饅　，翹首盼望我們光臨，晨四時即起床，預備食事，因爲各報道隊員是以各人鄉土的後方國民爲背景，在他們身上，可以覺出從鄉土帶來的香味。在邊隅遠地，生如此酷寒下，將士們在荒村部落中的生活，於此可見一端。防禦北疆的將士，不能不與三種無形的敵人苦鬥，那就是酷寒的氣候，地方病，以及雖無戰事但不能不時刻保持緊張情緒，即職務上的精神鬥爭。當地軍隊的將士完全克服了這些敵人，對於嚴寒以不當一會是，即在四十度亦算是平常的氣候，這因爲（一）防寒器具的完備（二）對於凍傷預防的訓練與萬全的準備（三）習慣於氣候，所以在最初一年雖有困難，但二三年後，十分寒冷的氣候已司空見慣，凍傷亦不加以注意，但凍傷者幾絕無僅有。早木盡以凍僵，和氣即成白烟，在防寒帽的口邊，生出了霜花，　花吹面，如割裂般痛楚，在如此酷寒的情況下，若沒有想像以外的精神力及鍛煉，平常人是無論如何不能忍受的，處嚴寒若平時的這一種錬成，可想而知。</p>
<p>雖沒有戰事，但在最前綫不能不保持緊張的情緒，這對於心身二方面都造成非常的疲勞。因此，各部隊長非常注意於精神的訓練，肉體的磨錬，不使有片刻的弛懈，每天朝晨，以及晚餐後，舉行健身操時，同時即授以銧劍術，一面舉行各種運動比賽，以期轉換興趣，鍛錬身體他方面，並　備各種娛樂設備，適應春，夏，秋，冬各種不同的季節而在野外與大自然作伴，傾注不斷的努力。</p>
<p>耕耘田園自給自足</p>
<p>兵士，下士官，將校，或中隊長，時常舉行座談會，相互報告當地軍隊生活的實況。在任何場合，第一，先訓練其行動不因寒冷而即畏縮，仍苦勞工作，不聽見有人訴說自己一身的生活上有何不便或不足，關於個人的事情，一笑置之，不再提及，這不是　私奉公的眞正生活嗎？部隊長鑒於日前國內的情勢，告訴當地軍隊應實行自給自足的方針，在片刻不息的嚴密訓練外，並從事耕稼畜牧，製豆腐，馬　的自給，亦付出非常的努力，而漸獲成功。〇〇部隊所製的麵包，有北邊第一之名，而爲來客所最珍重的物件。各部隊並又籌劃節約物資，一面爲調劑軍隊中的單調生活，獎勵努力有所創造的研究。在貧乏中計劃改善生活，鼓吹尊重物資的精神。</p>
<p>某部隊的門戶，完全利用白樺木的彈力，而發明了簡單的自動閉鎖裝置。〇〇部隊在庭前遍植瀟洒的白樺於四隅，而造成一小巧的庭園。〇〇部隊所着的草履。〇〇部隊當大戰記念日舉行　盡標語的展覽會，其中有不少優秀的作品。用白樺製成的細巧傢具，在各部隊都可以見到。</p>
<p>因尊重物資，隨之而獎勵儲蓄。如〇〇部隊一隊即已達二萬五千　個人的最　額有三百五十回者。</p>
<p>將士間感情融洽</p>
<p>將士間的和睦，爲日軍強勇的根抵。尤其如在北滿邊境，在地理上與其他地方隔絕，兵士相互間甚爲和睦，與上官尤爲融洽，中隊長們都異口同聲爲兵士說明親愛的立場，苦樂與共，某一兵士的不幸，由全中隊加以撫慰，將校也與兵士一樣在田間操作，時常舉行野餐，在短短的北滿之春夏季節中，設法找尋快樂，中隊長們常說笑話，使兵士無上下的感覺。某部隊說：「我們在　員時，本凝露宿郊野，今有如此壯麗的兵舍，完備的設備，充分的補給，再說貧困，那太過份了。」</p>
<p>某下士官說：「無論如何寒冷，有如此完備的防寒具，飲食，嗜好品又很充裕，所以應更努力以期無負於後方。」</p>
<p>一望千里，週地凍結，將士們在此曠野的國境，經受不斷的磨錬，兵舍，給養，娛樂，都不充分，但並不表示不滿。這一種謙虛，在北邊第一綫中困難的軍隊生活，與溫暖無事的內地生活的舒泰，完全異樣，來訪問當地的我們，強烈地感受到緊　的情緒。</p>
<p>北滿的春百花繚亂</p>
<p>漫長的冬期過去，百花繚亂的春天即將降臨北滿。</p>
<p>兵舍附近，山上，路傍。將變成花的田圃。</p>
<p>披重裘，着氈靴的將校門極目所見，一片凍結的大地，刺面的北風與粉雪，走路時所發出嗞嗞的聲響，這一種荒涼的景象，都將成爲名詞上聯想。稱爲迎春花的　紫色的翁草，在殘雪閉固的四月的地面上，伸出可憐的枝頭，在內地自春至仲秋開的花，都一齊放開苞蕾。日本的阿爾卑斯山上的花圃，今在此地的兵舍之前。將士們因春風的吹拂髦髭都生長出來了，（在冬天成爲冰柱如刺）各營舍得窗戶，全部打開，各室中的空罐，啤酒瓶，都插滿了不知名的野花。春臨人間！</p>
<p>當地各部隊將士，在此平靜着實中，蘊藏着必勝的戰　力。但北滿的國境，連　於遙遠的南方的戰野，晨夕相見，逝水如流的黑龍江上，蜿蜒着千三百里長透明的空間的鐵壁，與自然，與自身的精神相苦　，這是寂靜無聲的戰場。（翔·譯自二月七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>柏林對於羅斯福十二日所發　之廣擴演說、頃表明見解、認爲羅斯福一面自信反軸心軍將由北非驅出軸心軍、並將於年內實行進攻歐洲大陸、一面又承認突尼西亞軸心軍陣地之堅固、實爲前後矛盾、須知軸心軍對鄧扣克敗戰部隊之攻擊、毫不介意、至於夢想侵攻歐洲者、實不外表現其無知、殊不知今日歐洲沿岸之防備與北非迥異、</p>
<p>（義）羅馬十四日海通社電　此間對羅斯福總統最近之演說、殊少注意、僅稱、軸心國對羅斯福所　之大戰、完全處以鎮靜、羅馬人士認羅斯福之演說爲「好萊塢式」之演說、故並無重要性、最近之演說中、透露若干有興趣之事實、第一、美國人民對此次作戰之目的、尚未了解、因此美國政府所做之　種之限制、已引起人民之怨望、第二、羅斯福之演說中、證實美國經濟情形之嚴重性、社會之不安、罷工、衝突與共產黨之危機、層出不窮、第三、羅斯福承認美國發現敗戰主義者、精神頹廢者及社會上矛盾之現　、羅斯福所稱之勝利、吾人加以深信、反之、美國人民對於布爾希維克聯盟之危機、則深爲憂慮、蓋布爾希維克獲得勝利后、美國將喪失全部之國外貿易、單此已足以使熱心擁護羅斯福者喪失其熱誠、總之、羅斯福之演說辭中、不但明白表示美國人民失望之情緒、抑且證明羅斯福對戰事宣傳之失敗、</p>

<h3>朂受領助學金諸生</h3>
<p>— 黄警頑</p>
<p>際此時代動盪，民生凋敝，家素小康頗能自給者，以戰爭關係，轉徙流離，加以生活指數日高，糊口尙嫌不易，何能顧及其他，家有年屆學齡之子弟，欲水造就，往往限於環境，不能如願以償，職是而埋沒之靑年，不知凡幾，今日之靑年，即將來社會之中堅，其供獻於社會之程度，一以此時所受之敎育爲斷，靑年之埋沒，其事小，社會之損失，其事大，吾人服務社會，自不能不爲社會培養人材，得難袖手旁觀，聽其蹉跎歲月，而不予以進修機會，致令社會蒙受莫大之損失。</p>
<p>木報讀者有鑒於斯，乃於民國三十年秋，發起助學金運動，以優秀學子，家境寒畯，品行端正爲標準，經過考試或甄詢之後，享受助學金待過，此項助學金，乃基於多數讀者自動捐助，共間或係隱名慨捐鉅款，或係節衣縮食勉爲其難，或係勞動大衆節省血汗所得，或係孩提之童節省壓歲錢與一糖果費用，匯集涓埃，以成此一舉，况來源頗不易易出於多數人之雅意，適合多數人期望，較之其他個人或團體貸學金獎學金等，意義殊爲重大，得者更爲榮幸，推行以來，受惠各生尙能體察此旨，努力前修，以此造成大中小學各生及工商從業員，爲數已達五千人以上，各生本係淸寒優秀，益加奮勉，因得成爲敦品勵學之村，爲國家建誰之用，法良意美，現値艱難之會，誠極合　實際需要。</p>
<p>然而受助諸生，自應澈底反省，當如何努力奮發，乃不負人之期　，乃不誤已之前途，當信託自身，常以受助爲榮，得之非易，以此時加警惕，更於學業，品性，意志，心力，各方面，加以注意，使其日趨於光明之路，在刻苦中闢前途，在奮鬥中求進步，古人　壁偷光，囊螢照讀，日後成爲大賢，皆自刻苦中來，無非自力奮鬥，今日諸生受惠於人，得有外力援助，較之古人，甘苦不可同日血語，况係多數人殷股期望，掬誠相助獎勉有加，較之古人刻苦自勵，其遭過又不可以同日而語，諸生捫心自問，宜如何欣幸，如何振奮，始不負己負人在校諸生，所學應用社會科學與自然科學仍多偏於理論，工商從業各員因業務上之關係，雖略已接近實際，然均宜放開眼界，以社會爲當前　府，以自然爲研究對象，古人云車　馬足皆學問，賣漿屠狗亦英雄，望諸生切實體味，以深刻之限光，求基木之學藝，以合理之生活，鍛鍊其工作之技能，處處努力於充實人生方面，不依賴，不假借，不驕傲，不懈怠，時時期於活的運用，　生活與時代環境打成一片，作進一步的認識，進一步的實踐，不斷懷疑，不斷改革，不斷運用，不斷求知其所以然之故，循自然發展之途徑，努力邁進，於以接近事物，接近世界，手腦並重，知行合一，振刷共精神，充沛其志氣，如此把握現實，創造將來，行見將來之社會，學問家不必出於學府，事業家或　多於現代，則助學之功，尤爲不可限量。</p>
<p>諸生學成之後，尤當飲水思源。爲社會謀福利，常　百千倍於今日，滴滴歸源，不落虛空，雖非涌泉而報諸個人」實係宏共功用於社會，想亦助　諸君，所樂聞也。</p>
<p>自本報核准名額公布後，館前停立痛哭者，來信直陳苦况者，請求重行補考者，日有數起，終以粥少僧多，無能爲力，常其時也，正受助諸生領款繳費，洋洋得意之時，切望諸生於得意之餘，反躬自省，勿驕勿　，勿負助　美意，歲月不居，時序如流，望緒生及時努力。</p>

<h3>西貝地理考察</h3>
<p>— 謝鵬程</p>
<p>「西北史地考察地理組」記錄</p>
<p>苶卡盆地</p>
<p>本區東界以扎哈斯嶺，西界以都蘭堙中，南界以伍千修，北界以玩言通布，成爲東北西南向之窄長盆地，扎哈斯嶺完全由侏羅紀地層構成。北與古生代地層係斷層接觸，至苶卡盆地，則漸漸下落，蓋亦一地槽構造也。盆地之環山岩石，多爲紅色花剛岩，侵入於漸老岩層中。但在扎哈斯西溝，則見其侵入於侏羅紀地層中，是其侵入之時期，最早不能在侏羅紀之前，或即爲第三紀之產物。</p>
<p>山麓堆凟，佔最重要之成分細砂及高嶺土，沈積尤夥，盆地中部爲靑海著名之鹽池，東西長約四十公里，南北寬約十公里，鹽質完全結晶，由遠視之，一片銀色，宛如冰雪。鹽層由上而下，約可分爲四層：一曰鹽蓋，係白色之鹽鹼等晶體，厚約八九公分，二曰碎鹽，色白，純鹽正方結晶形體稍小，厚約六八十公分，至二公尺，三曰大鹽或靑鹽，晶體較大，內含黑泥質，色微靑，厚約一公尺至數公尺，爲現時探取之主要鹽層，四曰黑泥，有臭氣，就現在面積而言，約佔四百平方公里厚度，即以一公尺計，其儲量之宏富，已足驚人，此實爲西北之主要礦藏。自鹽池由「財政部」直接管轄後，規定每年外運四十萬担，惜交通困難，祇有馬車，牛，駱駝等爲運輸工具，竭共全力，每年僅能運出七八萬担，以供靑，甘，陜等省之民食。考鹽質之成因，由於環山多爲花剛岩，經風化分解後發生化學作用，復因天氣乾燥，蒸發力强，故有此鉅量鹽質之沈積，據土人云，經採取之鹽洞，不久即可長滿，是又可知水中鹽質濃度之大。且鹽質來源，若由於環山岩石風化分解之供給，誠屬取之不盡，用之不竭之礦藏，現由蘭州至茶卡已有公路，地勢平坦，建造輕使鐵道，亦屬易舉。</p>
<p>本盆地之地形，大致與靑海盆地同，惟盆地東部，扎哈斯西沸與那當兩谷口間，高約一百五十公尺之丘陵，純由巨細砂礫構成，蓋係第四紀，冰川之中磧，至於扎哈斯西溝甫山中之口形谷，冰窩等地形，保存尤爲完整。玩言通布山麓之冲積階地，約可分爲四層高者約一百二三十公尺，低者數公尺至十公尺，溪谷日事下切，構成河床與盆地水準未得平衡之原因，而本盆地所以仍在繼續下降中，亦可以此說明。又本盆地以氣候乾燥，植物羣落，亦隨之而異，扎哈斯大嶺之西，雖爲一廣闊無垠之濕生草原，惟漸西乾燥之程度亦漸增，梩柳，岌岌草，白刺，麻黄等觸目皆是，茶卡附近，氣候之變化更甚，多肉質之藜科及數種鹽生植物，他若西北著名藥用植物，有陽鎖者，亦產於此，拔地而茁，高約四五寸，發花時，呈紫紅色之捧狀。鹽池淺涸，非若靑海巨澤，有調節附近氣候之功能，周遭高山，雨澤較多，有時披戴白雪，故水草豐美，蒙古包與帳房大部分佈於深山窮谷之間。盆地內蒸發量重大，有時雨雪鮮達地面。茶卡鹽民所豢之牛羊，因亢旱而致斃者，爲數頗夥，茶卡位於鹽池之北，附近有蒙古包十餘幢，皆以掘鹽爲生，牧畜特其副業而已。距茶卡西約三十餘里，地名磨戶，土屋十餘橡，另窟洞一列，漢回雜處其間，大都由湟源，西寗，互助諸縣遷來者，其地山泉湧出，可資灌溉，故居民多種靑稞菓子燕麥之屬，土質良好，稍施肥料，便成沃壤，惜水量不多，墾地面積之增加，不無限度耳。</p>
<p>都蘭盆地</p>
<p>本盆地北界以容容豪饒（山名）及學禮到瓦，南界以千修，均約高出都蘭，六百公尺，成爲西北東南間之窄長盆地，其東曰都蘭湖，西曰都蘭鹽池。論其地質構造，客豪饒，及學禮到瓦，由古生代岩層及第三紀花剛岩組成，全體向西南推移，掩覆於第三紀中期或來期岩層之上，而後者岩層例置，俯伏共下，成爲山麓之邱陵，斷層綫之顯著，實非靑海及茶卡兩盆地中所能比擬。而盆地南岸之日剛達瓦，爲古生代變質岩與第三紀花剛岩複合體，全體向西南推進，掩覆於大旅獨幹盆地（詳後）北緣自白垔紀及第三紀末期地展之上，是本盆地之西南緣，乃一正斷層，據此而知本盆地構造，亦係一地槽，都蘭縣位於本盆地之北緣，海拔約三千八百公尺。東北山麓多砂丘，故本盆地多西南風。亦可依此證明矣。</p>
<p>容容豪饒之山麓堆積，緩向盆地傾瀉，高約百公尺左右之園形及長形孤立散佈其上，頗似冲積層之殘餘：實則爲側磧，尾磧及中磧之遺物，學禮到瓦山谷中，亦有此同樣地形。由都蘭埡口至上千壩之　形谷，長約二十餘公里，兩側山間均有冰窩地形之存在。是爲證明第四紀時之冰川會由都蘭埡口西流，會合容容豪饒及學禮到瓦兩山中之冰流而南入於本盆地。至於容容豪饒等之廣泛厚層山麓堆積，實非水流作用所能致，而爲冰融後之堆積也。都蘭鹽池之鹽質，大致與　卡相同，迄今尙無人開採，面積頗大，儲量必當，鹽質之來源，蓋亦由其周園花剛岩風化分解而成，附近榷物亦與茶卡無別。</p>
<p>都蘭附近，可稱爲半農業區域，除可引水灌溉之處遍植靑棵，小麥，菜子及蔬菜外，餘均具乾燥草原之性質。</p>
<p>都蘭寺與都蘭之間，有地名曰察汗河者，爲都蘭附近之風景區其地植物分佈，可爲都蘭四周百餘里內高山之代表，山上高四千公尺處，已有柏樹疏生，其下層（四千公尺以下）則與都蘭附近無異，柏樹林由四千公尺起至四千二百公尺止，向陽一側爲柏樹林，向陰一側則爲柏樹與雲杉混生林，或雲杉純林，至四千一百公尺處，間有山柳，生於林下，四千二百公尺更上，林木絕跡，山柳仍偃伏地面約動十武而後出，再上至山巓，仍有二三百公尺，此帶雖無恒雪，但四千二百公尺以下降雨，此帶則落　，以致植物少見，林樹下草與札哈斯略同，惟無大力蔴刺。至此處之深勢葉大黄，闊葉山韭菜，紫花紛芳之紫薰，即札哈斯亦未之見。都蘭盆地之地理性質亦近似茶卡，惟上述東北諸山，形勢高峻，雨雪豐盛，流水集注，都蘭河，流人盆地，水量甚宏，造成都闌良好之農墾地，吸引漢人農娃（番農）及薩拉栘來墾殖，分居於北東西三莊，計達一百三十餘戶，漢人　多數，回番次之，都蘭地廣人稀，故農業屬粗放型式，並採用輪種之方法。回漢擅於農事，所栽作物，種類較多，雖受天候變化之影響，亦不致全部無望。番農僅種植靑稞，其收穫常無一定之把握。都蘭附近，全部耕地，歲收約七百餘擔，足供本地之消費，惟附近游牧蒙番常來採購靑稞，故民食有時匱乏，尙須由湟源運　補凑。盆地內大部屬鹽鹼土，不利於作物之生產，僅在有大量淡水冲洗之所，始克耕植，乾燥草原內之農業區域，如夏日哈，匝哈烏蘇，察察小卡等莫不皆然，故耕地之開拓，頗受自然環境之限制，且本區農業，端賴灌溉，而諸河供給之水量，亦非用之不竭，是以大量農民之移殖，殊難有望。諸乾燥盆地。大都利於牧畜，常見蒙古包，散處於山谷水草　富之地，並有游牧番族分佈於都蘭盆地之南北今者蒙人勢力衰微，牧地日蹙，西部廣大之柴達木區域，備受哈薩民族之蹂躪與盤踞，不得不向東部　徙，其生存之空間更形狹小矣。</p>
<p>大旅獨幹盆地</p>
<p>本區盆地位於都蘭盆地之南，日剛達瓦山嶺隔於共間。阿爾維蘭峙其南，前者向南推進，後者向北掩覆，第三，紀末斯地層附伏於其下，是本盆地之南北，亦界以斷層也。日剛達瓦由古生代綠色片岩及砂岩之上，斷　露頭之顯著，可於當金蓋兒（溝名）見之。　東約三公里處，綠色片岩平舖第三紀末期岩層之上，宛如傘蓋，後者以礫岩，角礫岩，砂岩，黄土　等組成，岩性疎鬆似都較蘭盆地中之紅岩系時代尙幼，成分以現在週圍山嶺之岩屑爲主，如綠色片岩，花剛岩後白聖紀之礫砂岩等是。不整合件於白垔紀地層之上，南傾或東南傾約五十至八十度，盆地中部則减至十度左右，第四盆地中之側磧，中磧及尾磧等，保存尤爲完整，就現在地形推論：第四紀時之有大冰川，在本區內可分爲兩大流：一由阿爾維蘭東部北流，沿過（溝名）而入都蘭盆地一由阿爾維蘭西部向西南流，滙集中北山中冰雪而入大旅獨榦盆地，介乎當日兩大冰川問之中磧，現在仍屹然保存於當金蓋兒之南。當金蓋兒係一狹窄峽谷，冲積　甚薄，如與過相較，蓋一較新切穿之河谷也。至於本區盆地中之冰融堆積，國積廣泛，尤非前述各盆地听可比擬。阿爾維蘭之西北山麓，砂丘分佈之面積甚大，儼然一砂漠區域景衆，植物之生於期地者，僅揑柳，白刺，枸杞，岌岌草等數種而已。</p>
<p>自蘭州至都蘭間一段考察之結果，可綜述如下：地質方面：太古代南山系岩炭二疊紀，三疊紀，白堊紀等地層，沿途均有公佈，面第三紀及第四紀地層，佔有較廣大之面積、大成岩以花剛岩爲優越，且多屬第三紀產物。其次爲輝綠岩等安成岩脈，侵入於較老地層中，至於造由運動時期，除在甘腎路上所見之石炭二疊紀與南山系，三疊紀與石炭二疊紀，第三紀上期或中期與各老岩層之不整合接　外，第三紀末期之沉積（日月由系）與各老岩層及第四紀沖積層之不整合則尤爲　著而普徧，是甘靑　近及最重要之造由運動，蓋在第三紀末期或第四紀初期也。今日地形之主幹均由此運動造成盆地與山嶺之走向，大致爲西北東南，而二者之界綫，多爲斷層之所在地。運動方向，約由東北向西南，故靑海氽卡，都蘭及大旅獨幹等盆地，均係地槽形式，此種運動似仍在繼續進行中，故山麓堆積日增，溪谷下切日期隆，是或盆地尚事下降之徵　歟。至於苶卡及都蘭兩鹽池儲量之富，頗值重視。而其周　山嶺之花剛岩，爲供給鹽質之來源。第四紀之冰川地形，保存完整者，除在泰嶺所見與大巴山相同外：而青海南岸至都蘭附近所見一　形谷，側磧，主磧，　磧及冰窩等尤爲完善，實可證明第四紀之冰川，曾分佈於甘青海拔約四千公尺之地區也。至於冰融後，造成廣泛厚層之堆積，尤爲茶卡，都蘭及文旅獨幹三盆地之特色，植物方面自蘭州附近至都蘭一段聞大部分　具有乾燥草原之性質，實西部新疆蒙古等地帶之餘緒，惟雨水濕潤或地水　富之處，則成濕生草原或苔蘇濕原，凡哈斯察汗河兩　係都蘭以東高山植物分佈之　表，枸樹林分熱帶，幾爲都蘭附近數白里內各高山共有之現象。　（三十二年一月十二日寄）</p>

<p>南洋各地特輯　之一</p>
<h3>三百年南洋風濤錄</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>南洋，這中華民族的海外的故鄕，由於英美帝國主義勢力的總退却，已經面臨着一個新的時代，這是要求南洋原來的住民開始用自己的力囊來決定自己命運的時候了！特別是我們中華民族，由於歷史上和南洋各地特別密切的關係，由於廣大的華僑在南洋各地政治上文化上尤其是經濟上的潛勢力的存在，更加不能不特別關心到它的現狀和它的前途。</p>
<p>南洋在三百年來，變成了海盜的樂園，變成了荷蘭，英，美，等國的殖民地經營者！資本主義吸血鬼的寳庫，同時也變成了當地土著民族和中國僑胞被壓迫被榨取的人間地獄！</p>
<p>南洋羣島，他就是西洋人所謂印度尼西亞（Indonesia）由總面積達二百萬方公里以上的好幾千個島嶼所構成，以雙弧形位於亞細亞洲和澳大利亞洲之間，在十八世紀末期以前，他的人口沒有　過三首萬人口。羣島上的爲數衆多的種族和民族，處於社會，經濟發展的不同水準上，說着　種各樣的語言和方言。</p>
<p>由於羣島位置在古代文化之邦的中國和印度之間的海道上的有利的地形，土著各民族都在很久以前就受到了中印兩國的影響，爪哇和蘇門答臘的若干區域，是環繞在印度洋流域最發達國家的周圍，</p>
<p>印度和中國的「軍事遠征隊」、屢次征服和佔領羣島中的個別的區域，居住在羣島沿岸的馬來樓，就是由當地原有居民處海外遠征隊的「新客」混合而形成的。馬來人和爪哇人並列地站在羣島各民族中發展的最高階段上，他們的語言，形成羣島沿岸區域最通行的語言。</p>
<p>羣島沿　的住民，很早就曾用自己特有的掘溝方法鑿通羣島的內海，完成個別島嶼間的交通。他們還冒險地作較遠的旅行，達到了印度，馬達加斯加，非洲。而中國和印度的商人，也很早和羣島進行貿易，收買各種香料。</p>
<p>在十三至十五世紀，當中國元朝和明朝的時候，由於印度征服的結果，在爪哇產生了盛大的印度，爪哇封建國家，其中有幾個非常强盛。受到羣島上許多小民族的朝貢。同時，中國和印度傳去—灌溉制度，農業開始在羣島上發展起來。開始發生了淵源於印度的爪哇字母，而爪哇蘇門答臘，峇厘的人民，也從印度征服者方面傳來了宗敎，印度敎以及一部份佛敎，在十五世紀前在羣島的最發達的區域中佔有統治的地位。</p>
<p>到了十八世紀前夕，同敎開始在羣島上奪取了印度敎和佛敎的地位，成爲印度尼西亞羣島大部份地方的統治宗敎。不過，在若干地區，是各敎並立發展的狀態。</p>
<p>十六世紀，印度在羣島所建立的許多强大的封建國家沒落了，讓位給回敎的公國。可是，不久，荷蘭人開展了延至兩個世紀的殖民統治，把這些公國的威力摧毀了。尼德蘭束印度公司壟斷了一切貿易，把他們與外部市塲切斷，並剝奪了過去的收入。他們用各種條約威迫爪哇王及封建公候們提供土產。</p>
<p>爪哇，在羣島中是封建制度最發達的地區，各國國王有無限的權威，正像中國一樣，實行其「普天之下，莫非王土，率土之濱，莫非王臣」的制度，農民不僅須納地租，還要服繁重的勞役。</p>
<p>荷蘭人侵入，加强了封建的壓迫，反對地方封建主及公司代言人的農民起義便接踵而起，而各公國（土邦）也不斷和公司的掠奪政策作戰。這種戰鬥的血，染紅了整個十八世紀的南洋歷史。特別是一七五〇—七六三年的戰爭最爲壯烈。可是，荷印公司終於利用各公國的區屬和地方當局之間的矛盾和內爭，把民族反抗壓平了，並且擴展了自己的領土。到了十八世紀的末期，尼德蘭東印度公司奪取了爪哇領土的大部份，展開了對土民的剝削。後來，除了爪哇，馬邦拉小島之外，荷蘭人把常時大多數還未被征服的印度尼西亞的一切島嶼稱爲「外部領地」。</p>
<p>「外部領地」在十八世紀末期以前還保留了許多不同的社會結搆成份，在婆羅洲，西里伯斯以及其他羣島的孤立的內部區城內，還保留着民族制度，亦新幾內亞的最落後土人中，還保留着食人肉的制度。東印度公司在「外部領地」實行掠奪政策。</p>
<p>但是，自從爭取西班牙遺產的戰爭退出之後，尼德蘭已成爲次要的殖民强國了。在東方的覇位，不得不讓給經濟發展超過了尼德蘭的英國了。東印度公司已經不能阻止英國侵入印度尼西亞，英國人在蘇門答臘的西岸鞏固起來，侵入了婆羅洲，企圖利用荷蘭人與土民戰爭的困難。於是，尼德蘭東印度的壟斷被破壞了。英荷戰爭（一七八〇—七八四年）給公司以最後的打擊。他在印度東岸的據點陷入英人之手，荷蘭在蘇門答臘西岸的領地，由公司的官僚們不戰而降地交給英國人。</p>
<p>十九世紀是英國首先爭覇南洋的時代，接着而來的是美國。</p>
<p>一八一一年，巴達維亞附近出現了由一百艘兵給組成的英國艦隊，印度的總督親自指揮遠征。一萬二千名陸戰隊幾乎無抵抗地佔領了殖民地的首都。荷蘭軍退却和轉到內地逃散了。當英兩兵艦在三寳壟附近出現時，印度尼西亞的土兵起義，殺了荷蘭軍官，英國在印度尼西亞的統治時代就此開始。</p>
<p>英國在印度尼西亞實行了剝削方法的大改變。一八　三　年實行廢除蘇丹，兼併其領土，使蘇丹靠着英國的津貼過活。在英國人直接治理的羣島之領土上土酋政權被剝奪了，英國人還奪取了司法權和收稅權。整個爪哇被劃分爲十六個行政區，由英國委派的歐洲官吏的統治。梭羅和日慈雖還作爲附庸的公國而保留着，那正像印度的土邦一樣完全失去了自主。</p>
<p>貨幣稅和土地稅等等新的剝削方法，在舊的剝削方式中出現了，但現了，但是舊的桎梏依然存在，爪哇等地的手工業受到了嚴重的打擊，外國資本開始侵入農村，榨取的範圍擴大了。</p>
<p>拿破侖帝國崩潰以後，尼德蘭恢復獨立，收回了自己的殖民地，但沒有收回錫蘭，海峽殖民地及西圭亞那。在收回殖民地運動中，又和英國展開了迎戰。爪哇的人民，和廣大南洋的中國同胞，乘機展開了反對殖民地吸血鬼的起義，特別是一八二五—三〇年的起義，把殖民强國震顫了，荷蘭人對付不了「人數太多」的游擊隊，政府軍的爪哇部隊時時轉到起義者方面去，這種血戰持續了五年，終於，因爲附庸公國的封建主的動搖，荷蘭人收買方　與欺騙性的改良政策生效了，才算一寸一寸地征服起義的區域。</p>
<p>荷蘭人鎭壓了起義之後，殖民地政權的地位鞏固之後，實行更苛酷的剝削，特別出名的是强迫種値制度，全體農民必須把自己田地的一定部份栽培由政府所指示的輸出種植，在强制的程序上，他們必須栽種糖蔗，印度藍咖啡樹，烟草等，全部收成　交給政府的倉庫以代巷貨幣的　稅。此外，農民對政府，對大小官吏，都要履行各種公的私的勞役。成千成萬的農民被趕去建築海港城堡和大官小吏的私人住宅。</p>
<p>英國人在南洋羣島的經營並沒有放鬆，他們在蘇門答臘等處建立起勢力，特別是建設新加坡，建立從印度洋到太平洋海道上有巨大戰略和經濟意義的陣地，及德蘭被迫向英國讓步，爲要停止英國侵入蘇門答臘，尼德蘭，不得不把在印度以及麻六甲半島的自己領地的一切殘餘讓給英國，和英國平分亞洲東南部的領地。</p>
<p>然而英國繼積銳進，首先在北婆羅洲，在婆羅奈，和薩拉瓦克建立根據地，把這兩國置於英國的控制之下。荷蘭人不斷的反抗，一八五一年，西婆羅洲的征服開始了，無情的壓迫，激起中國僑胞的反抗，我們的祖先，曾英出地反對荷蘭的常備軍和封鎖一切河上的艦隊。一八五四年，要城蒙托拉陀失陪，華僑慘遭屠戮但是抵抗力並沒有摧毀。三合會繼續領導同胞和土民進行反抗，直到一八五六年，才因孤立無援而被消滅。但是，在車婆羅洲的馬辰等地，還不斷地爆發着起義。</p>
<p>十九世紀的中期，英國已先後在馬來半島，在蘇門答臘在北婆羅洲和澳洲等地樹立起殖民地政權，和荷蘭平分西南太平洋的勢力與利益，可是新興的美國也逐漸推進其勢力，到了十九世紀末期，特別是對於菲律賓的爭奪，一八九八年，美西戰爭的結果，西班牙人經略了三百年之久的菲律賓羣島，便完全爲美國所佔有了。</p>
<p>整個十九世紀下半期，充滿若歐美列强爭奪東方尤其是南洋殖民地的戰爭的血腥，南洋羣島以至安南緬甸和中國沿　各地，都陷於悲慘的蹂躪被踐踏的絕境。然而，在這悲慘痛苦之中，廣大的南洋居民種中國同胞醒覺了，直接間接的在「民族自決」的旗幟之下，爲解放而鬥爭，十九世紀和二十世紀的三分之一的歷史，便是被壓迫民族反抗歐美帝國主義奢的悲壯的戰爭史，特別是一丸四一年十二月八日以後，歐美帝國主義勢力終於被驅出南洋以至整個太平洋，三百多年的血史已揭定了最後的一頁，接着而來的，將是我們東亞民族自決的歷史，我們要怎樣護愼和與奮地描寫出燦爛的未來的歷史啊！</p>

<h3>一月份徵文錄取第一名　我的生活—醫院侍應生（上）</h3>
<p>— 以靑</p>
<p>「到處留心皆學問」。這是王校長在初中部畢業典禮時，特爲向我們十四位不再繼續升學的同學，吿誡的訓括·他再番的安慰我們，爲了經濟問題而輟學，愼勿爲了失學而消極。他誠摯的向我們解釋，只要自己努力，隨時隨地，都可不化任何代價，而獲得可貴的學問。他列舉許多賢哲，在艱難困苦的環境下，完成他們不朽的豐功偉業·他激勵我們，勿因輕信俗諺所謂，『畢業即失業』。而頽唐·他勗勉我們，保持着有爲的朝氣。他指示我們，要脚踏實地的苦幹。同時他吿訴我們一個找職業的機會，是某大醫院，招考二十名初中程度的侍應生。最後他訓諭我們，保守職業，比找尋職業，來得不容易，沒有恒心，決不會達到成功的目的。</p>
<p>於是，我抱着滿懷的高興，參加這匯徴考試，居然僥倖，名列前茅。從此我抱着爲求學而工作的意旨，度了十八個月有規律的生活。</p>
<p>當我辦妥了入院手續，換上白式制服，胸襟上佩了侍應生一號的徽章，會同十九位同伴，靜候支配工作的時候。那位年靑的事務長，和藹而親切的，講述各部份的工作，他說「侍應生」顧名思義，是專爲侍奉人家，應承人家的下層工作。但是，先得認淸，「工作」都是神聖的，『工作一是沒有貴賤的畛域，尤其是醫院從業員，先決資格，必須有强健的體格，聰明的感覺，博愛的觀念，至誠的行爲，熱情的懷抱，不然，不能克盡歐職。</p>
<p>我們每天工作十小時，自修和休息六小時，睡眠八小時，每晨有二十分鐘健身操，每星期可輪流休假半天，每年有二星期假期，每月領到生活津貼二十五元，和平均三十元左右的獎勵金，膳宿都有院方供給，所以足够維持着個人的生活開支，和每月三元錢的儲蓄金。</p>
<p>我們的集團，爲了發揮自治精神，組織了聯誼會，相互規勉着同伴的弱點，集體商討關於工作認爲滿意的心得，用突擊的方式，溫習各種功課。有時蒙醫師們及護士長等出席指導我們關於衛生方面的基本常識。雖然我們已是職業靑年，而依舊過着學校生活。的確得到許多可貴的學問，而且沒有化上任何代價。這是最値得我們感激院方優渥的待遇，因爲生活安定，使我們對於工作，格外感到興趣。</p>
<p>我們整天的和病人接觸，隨時都有被病菌襲擊的危險，所以院方按期爲我們注射防疫劑，和佈種牛痘。每隔六個月檢查體格一次。當第三次體格檢查的結果，二個同伴，發現了初期的肺病，經過二個月的療養，方始恢復了健康，因爲這一回的敎訓，我們更進一步的保持我們自己的健康。</p>
<p>最初，我被派在門診室服務，那時天氣非常之熱，例診病人之外，每天平均有四五個時疫病人，來院急診，我一刻不停忙着打掃和消毒。同時服毒病人亦相當的多。根據我的日記簿統計，三個月內，共有二十七次，全係女性，內中二十二次爲了家庭糾紛，最滑稽的一次，一個女子，要求丈夫買一雙皮鞋，不能達到目的而呑服了不滿一西西的鴉片灰，送到急診室的時候，他閉目不言，急得他的家屬手足無措，施行急救之後，化了十幾元錢醫藥費，笑咪咪的去了。這顯見一般智識的低落，和一部份社會道德的淪亡。當時眞有令人啼笑皆非之嘆，後來却變了公餘談話的資料。</p>
<h3>萬世師表（十三）</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton　依今譯</p>
<p>『我的確和你表同情，』吉普斯說。</p>
<p>『我希望你會這樣。這就是使我到這裏來請求你的原因。簡單地說，我的意見是這樣——如果你也覺得這樣，並且肯放在心上——暫時回到校裏來，怎麼樣？你的樣子還很適宜，並且，當然，你知道一切的情形。我並不是要將許多艱難的工作給你做——你不必用力管着任何事情——只要照顧照顧各種雜務，隨你的意思。我所期望於你的，比了任何事情更加重要的，並非你肯做什麽實際的工作——雖則那樣當然是很寳貴的——要你在其他方式上，幫忙一下——只要屬於學校就够了。以前，連現在，誰也沒有比你，更受歡迎的——如果有什麼危險發生，事情要弄糟，你可以幫着維持下去。也許正有這樣的危險存在着。……」</p>
<p>吉普斯喘息地，心裏充滿着神聖的喜悅，回答說：『我就來。……』</p>
<p>（十四）</p>
<p>他仍舊保留　威葛特夫人屋子裏的房間；的確，他仍舊住在那裏；不過每天早上，大約十點半，他就穿上外衣，繞上圍巾，越過大路到學校裏來。他覺得很適宜，實際的工作並不費力。只有幾班拉丁文和羅馬史的課——老功課——甚至還是老的讀音法。關於某種婚姻法的同樣笑話——新來的一代人還沒有聽見過，爲了這笑話所獲得的成功，他確實感到滿足。他覺得像一位音樂堂中受人歡迎的人，在最後一次出現之後，又回到臺上來。</p>
<p>他們大家都說，眞是奇妙之至，他會那樣快地記得每一個學生的名字和面孔。他們却沒有想到，他本來在路那邊怎樣密切地和他們接觸着。</p>
<p>他完全是一個偉大的成功者。他在某種奇妙的方式上，幫忙着諸事，這是他們大家都知道並且覺到的。他一生中初次覺到了必要——對於某事的必要，某事是最接近着他的內心的。世界上沒有更高尙的感情，這最高尙的感情終於就是他的。（三十六）</p>
<h3>「夏威夷·馬來大海戰」試映記</h3>
<p>— 半狂</p>
<p>望眼欲穿的「夏威夷·馬來大海戰」終於在昨日（十三日）舉行試映了。記者被邀，得先睹爲快，爰將觀後印象拉雜寫在下面。</p>
<p>這是一部相當長的，故事性的記錄片。故事以友田義一爲中心，寫這個忠男的少年，怎樣被忠君報國思想激勵著，決心考入航空隊豫科練習部，實現他的作一個海軍少年飛行兵的夢想。片中描寫兵舍生活，相當動人。我們看見千百個雄健男兒在體操，游泳，相撲（即摔角），踢球賽艇……而在這些運動技術中，無處不含蓄堅忍的敎訓。印象投深的，是賽艇的一幕。友田的一隊輸了，隊長問他們：「知道何以敗北的原因麼？」友田答稱？「因爲船不好」，隊長就說？「眞正打起仗來的時候，你能因爲兵器不好，就推說沒有戰敗麽？」在這些地方，我們很可以看出日本軍人訓練的特色。他們的優點就在吃苦，耐勞，絕對的服從性等等。</p>
<p>「夏威夷·馬來大海戰」我覺得是名符其實的記錄片而已。人物比較差，是不用說的。記錄片的特色，就在通過導演的主觀的選擇，簡捷明快地用畫面灌輸給觀衆一毬思想，一種意識。我們看了本片，沒有不感覺日本軍人的勇武和服從性的。如果說本片成功，那麽，這就是它的成功了。</p>
<h3>走向「自力更生」之路</h3>
<p>— 珍</p>
<p>記得有人說過：『世界上最可憐和最痛苦的生物，是中國舊家庭中的婦女。』有實地經騐的姊妹們，恐怕得承認這句話吧。假如我不是生爲女兒身，無論家庭怎樣困難，必能與兄弟受到敎育平等的機會，但不幸得很，我終於在數年前失學了，理由是『女兒終是人家的』女子何必讀那麽多的書！」然而求知和求生一樣，是天賦的本能，是人類對社會唯一的權利，我要求生，同時我亦要求知，限於自己未能自立，父母可以剝奪我日間進學校的幸福，但是我相信，在廣大的人羣中，我會我到一個棲息，滿足我求知的慾望。</p>
<p>也許是『有志事竟成』吧！去年暑假，我終於藉友人的介紹，考入麥特赫司脫路三百九十二號自力女子夜校，至今雖然讀了一個學期，可是我衷心感到無限滿足，自思社會如我者必不少，敢將母校略情介紹如下，以吿同痛者。</p>
<p>上海是無奇不有的，僞君子，職業慈善家正多着呢，雖然我是憑朋友的介紹，得悉「自力」的當局是具有相常歷史的民衆敎育家，不過我仍小心翼翼隨時靜觀他們的言行的，記得有一次，我問我們的『無薪校長』（這個名詞是我後來才知到及證實的），『學校爲什麽不多登招生廣告，以廣招徠？』他答得很妙的：『醫德高尙的名醫，絕不登廣吿，一所良好的學校亦不應該靠廣吿招生的。』本校經濟情况，有使當局非這樣不可，但環觀學校半年來的設施，無一不是重實際而不尙空談的，果然開學後，同學都擠滿了每間敎室。</p>
<p>許多義務夜校是對學生盡義務，而敎昌校長則並不盡義務的，我們的學校就恰好相反，『這是很慚愧的，我們同人全是盡義務，因爲向同學們到底收了一點雜費，（極少的一點，初中十元，小學八元，貧苦者全免——作者按）所以不敢掛出義務的招牌。『記得「無薪校長」向我們這樣說過，但是這是很應該嗎，我們的學校是以自力更生爲宗旨，以「人格第一」爲操守，旣非私人撥資興辦，亦不受示於任何機關團體，沒有基金，又無津貼，房租那麽貴，要我們學生分担一部份經費，孰謂不宜，何况同學們所繳納的，確是一部份而已。</p>
<p>我們雖然付出極少的代價，但我們的受益是極其實惠的，眞可說價廉物美了，校長是某大藥廠的化學師，生理衛生敎育是醫學博士，『旣無報酬，水準又如此高，故本校帥資來源十分困難。』校長不時向我們訴說着，是的，爲了同學們都是成年失學的居多，她們忙在　抽空來求學，與那些爲文憑而入學的小姐們是絕然不同的，她們愛惜自己的光陰，同時亦愛護學校，遇着不盡職的或程度不够的先生，都善意的向校長要求掉換，事果屬實，校長大概順從衆意的居多。</p>
<p>我們旣然以自力更生爲宗旨，所以一切課程都以實用爲主，去蕪存菁，在在敎靑我們如何處世之道，在可能範圍內，當局還替同學們介紹職業，務使學者眞能自力更生，在家庭在社會能流自己的汗，吃自己的飯，完完全全的做一個獨立自由的人。</p>

<h3>Establishment of Wartime Cultural Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>The "Total War Participation" has reached the stage of implementation, requiring that all undertakings in the political, economic, and cultural sectors nationwide adapt to the needs of wartime and complete the wartime system. This is to concentrate all human, material, and intellectual resources to strive for ultimate victory. The wartime political system has now been established and is being implemented. In the economic field, the National Defense Temporary Conference has passed the "Wartime Economic Policy Guidelines," which will soon be implemented. However, in order to thoroughly implement the wartime political and economic policy guidelines, we further hope that the government will quickly and carefully establish wartime cultural policy guidelines.</p>
<p>Culture is the highest manifestation of a country's national strength, and wartime culture is the driving force behind the people's "Total War Participation." In peacetime, a country's rise and fall can be seen in its cultural situation; in wartime, if cultural policies are correct and cultural movements are active, then all wartime policies and measures will inevitably be widely understood and supported by the people. It can universally mobilize all active and passive forces among the people, implement policies and decrees, and achieve final victory. Conversely, if wartime culture is not emphasized, if there is no correct wartime cultural policy and the earnest execution of such a policy, then even with perfect political and economic policies and wartime implementations, it will be difficult to achieve thorough implementation in practice.</p>
<p>The main task of the wartime cultural policy guidelines is to mobilize the people of the whole country to participate in the fight to defend East Asia and liberate China. Therefore, this policy guideline must be proactive and constructive, to improve and promote the cultural standards of China. Especially in China today, after six years of long-term turmoil and unrest, cultural undertakings have long fallen into a state of decline and stagnation. Therefore, today's wartime cultural policy guidelines must first and foremost be proactive and constructive wartime cultural policy guidelines, providing multifaceted guidance to national cultural undertakings, encouraging and promoting national culture, and expanding all wartime facilities in the cultural arena, so that the people of the whole country can enter a brand-new cultural garden. In this garden, they can understand the world, understand the times, understand their own motherland and its true friends and enemies, and then spontaneously and automatically dedicate themselves to the cause of national and East Asian liberation. This is the prerequisite for establishing wartime cultural policy guidelines.</p>
<p>The current war, from the perspective of the nation, is a war against Anglo-American enslavement of China. Therefore, China's wartime cultural policy must mainly be a cultural policy suitable for mobilizing the strength of the Chinese people. It must be Chinese, and especially a cultural policy that can be loved and accepted by the majority of the Chinese people. This is one. Secondly, from the perspective of the East Asian nations, this war is a war in which the East Asian nations rise up to resist and eliminate the aggressive policies of Anglo-American imperialism. Therefore, the wartime cultural policy guidelines must have the characteristics of the East Asian national liberation movement and the characteristics of opposing Anglo-American imperialist culture. We must thoroughly liquidate the actual situation of the European and American colonial management policies for the past hundred years, such as the deception, anesthetization, and exploitation of the nations of East Asia, through wartime cultural policy guidelines with such characteristics. At the same time, we must actively establish a new culture that guarantees the independence and liberation of the East Asian nations, especially the research and promotion of Chinese and Japanese cultures, the research and promotion of the cultures of all East Asian nations, and the establishment of a solid cultural front among the East Asian nations. This is two. Furthermore, from an international perspective, this war is a war to eliminate the old order of the Anglo-American imperialist system, and its purpose is to establish a new world order in which all countries and nations help each other and seek common development. Therefore, the wartime cultural policy guidelines we hope for must have this new era significance and world significance. This is three. The above three are the basic principles of the wartime cultural policy guidelines.</p>
<p>With the prerequisites and basic principles, let us then talk about the specific content, which can be divided into negative and positive aspects. The negative aspect is naturally the implementation of wartime cultural control: (1) Clearly stipulate the scope and methods of wartime restrictions on the people's speech, publication, writing, and communication, so that the people and the media have something to follow. (2) Regarding the consumption of cultural materials, there should be strict and reasonable control, especially for paper, ink, etc. Publications that do not contribute to wartime national policy and are not beneficial to social and national culture should be restricted. Necessary restrictions should also be made on the consumption of cultural materials by non-cultural departments. However, we must especially understand the poverty of Chinese culture, so negative restrictions should only be implemented occasionally in cases of absolute necessity. The most important thing is to actively guide and cultivate in order to build China's wartime culture.</p>
<p>So, what should be done in the positive aspect? First, it is necessary to concentrate specialized talents from all aspects and establish a national-scale cultural front under the correct leadership of the government. This is a cultural headquarters for cooperation between officials and the people. Its main task is to promote and implement wartime cultural policies, and to advance the work of wartime cultural mobilization. This is not only to control all cultural departments, cultural undertakings, and cultural movements nationwide, but also, and more importantly, to strive to promote wartime culture, develop national cultural undertakings, promote wartime cultural movements, and improve the cultural standards of the people nationwide. Second, the wartime cultural policy guidelines must stipulate methods for uniting warriors in all aspects of the cultural world, and should truly concentrate the strength of the whole country to promote wartime cultural movements, develop Chinese cultural undertakings, and improve the cultural standards of the people. Third, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of wartime cultural cadres and create a new army of cultural undertakings for the new China. Therefore, the creation of the highest central cultural research institution and the establishment of a national cultural cadre training institution are even more urgent undertakings in this wartime. This matter is of great importance not only for the present but also for the future construction of China, and must be carried out carefully today. Fourth, we hope that there will be a fixed and substantial amount of funding in the government budget to develop cultural undertakings and promote cultural movements, and that the society will also cooperate in promoting cultural donation movements. The main uses of this kind of funding should be stipulated as: (1) Universally increasing the number of public libraries, museums, especially exhibitions of wartime life in various countries, and all exhibitions that adapt to wartime culture, etc. (2) Subsidizing private cultural undertakings—newspapers, magazines, libraries, publishing companies, etc.—to promote cultural movements and improve national cultural standards. What is even more urgent is (3) In view of the hardship of the daily lives of cultural figures at present, appropriate subsidies should be given with a certain amount of funding, such as the universal establishment of research institutes and specialized academic grants, so that aspiring literati can concentrate on the specialized study of culture and academics: special awards should be set up to reward people who have made contributions in culture: in particular, responsible institutions should also be set up to assist cultural figures with illness and difficulties at any time and anywhere.</p>
<p>Culture is the driving force for realizing total war participation. We hope that the government will set wartime cultural policy guidelines as soon as possible and implement them earnestly. We also expect all sectors of society, especially the cultural world itself, to rise up together and promote its realization.</p>

<h3>Soviet Strong Offensive Blocked, Fierce Fighting Unfolds at Kharkov, Local Battles on Taman Peninsula, German Raid on Soviet Positions in Central Don Region</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 14th (Havas) - Today's German war report states that south of Novorossiysk, Soviet forces launched local attacks yesterday but were unsuccessful. German aircraft bombed enemy positions and sank two transport ships. In the central Don region, German commando units penetrated Soviet lines, destroying 35 tanks and cutting off their rear communications. Yesterday, large enemy forces attacked from the east and northeast of Kharkov but were repulsed, leaving behind 4,000 bodies. Twenty tanks were destroyed. North of Kursk, enemy forces penetrated German lines at several points but were annihilated. Yesterday, Soviet forces on the Eastern Front lost a total of 129 tanks. One German infantry division has withdrawn from enemy positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas) - Recent dispatches from the front report that after receiving reinforcements, Soviet forces launched strong offensives in areas such as the Taman Peninsula, Kalif, and Kursk. Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk area of the Taman Peninsula were repulsed yesterday. German forces in Krasnodar are moving according to plan. Fierce fighting erupted in the northeast of Kharkov the day before yesterday. Most enemy forces were repulsed, and those that penetrated German lines were mostly surrounded and easily annihilated. North of Kursk, Soviet forces attacked in several waves but achieved nothing, losing a large number of prisoners and equipment. Only minor battles have occurred in the central sector of the Eastern Front in recent days. Soviet forces continue to attack between Volkhov and Lake Ladoga, and in the Leningrad area. The situation around Schlüsselburg is the most intense.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front sources, the battle for Kharkov is intensifying. Soviet forces are encircling the city from the east, north, and south. German forces launched a general counteroffensive on the 12th, and after a prolonged and fierce battle, repulsed Soviet forces from the northeast. In the past three days, Soviet forces have suffered 3,352 killed, 435 captured, and lost 10 tanks, 4 artillery pieces, 117 machine guns, and 71 mortars. The initiative in the Kharkov region has been entirely seized by the German forces.</p>
<p>Izyum Sees Heavy Soviet Concentration, Aiming to Attack Rostov</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front sources, the situation in the Don River estuary became more intense again on the afternoon of the 13th. German forces engaged advancing Soviet forces on a 250-kilometer front east of Rostov, with large-scale mechanized battles unfolding in various locations. According to Soviet communiqués over the past two days, Soviet forces have advanced to Krasnoarmeysk, a key railway junction 50 kilometers south of Krasnodar, and to the vicinity of Voroshilovsk, 150 kilometers north of Rostov, and it is widely rumored that they have approached Rostov. German front-line reports on the 13th stated that German forces are currently launching fierce attacks, cutting off communication between the advancing Soviet units and their rear, and launching encirclement and annihilation operations in several areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas) - Although the weather in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is mild, the snow and ice have not yet melted, so the enemy's offensive is not affected. The Donets Basin remains the center of the enemy's offensive, with fierce battles unfolding at several railway hubs. In the Izyum area, the Soviets have concentrated heavy forces, seemingly intending to outflank the German rear and attack Rostov. The German High Command's counteroffensive actions have not yet produced very significant results. The German front lines in the Donets and Don River estuary areas have been slightly shortened, and the situation in Rostov remains unchanged. After the withdrawal of German forces from Krasnodar, they can be redeployed to Novorossiysk to fight the Soviet forces landing there. Fierce fighting continues in the Kharkov area, and the enemy seems to be attempting to encircle the city from two sides. According to yesterday's German war report, all enemy offensives have been repulsed. North of Kursk, the German trapezoidal defense line remains the main obstacle to the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>Several Points Behind German Lines, Infiltrating Soviet Forces Annihilated</p>
<p>Vichy, 14th (Havas) - A correspondent stationed in Berlin reports that in the past 24 hours, German and Soviet forces have continued to fight fiercely. The Red Army is currently doing everything possible to take full advantage of the current climate and launch continuous offensives. The Red Army High Command, drawing on the experience and lessons learned from the past two years of combat, seems to be making every effort to improve the Red Army's position before the winter passes, as the Red Army is better suited to winter warfare. Not only that, but the Red Army can also take full advantage of its deep understanding of Soviet geography and the possibilities of winter warfare. However, the German side is also studying special strategies to adapt to the Soviet climate. Therefore, at the beginning of the Red Army's winter offensive, it dug trenches in the snow to transport troops to the front for combat. By now, the German army has already understood these strategies and is using artillery and landmines to counter the Red Army, rendering its strategies ineffective. German officials are keeping silent about the alarming news released by the Soviet side and are not paying much attention to it. It is generally said that the Eastern Front cannot be considered a fixed front, divided by definite points, especially in the south, where the situation is chaotic. In some places, the Red Army has penetrated behind German lines but has been annihilated by German forces. On another occasion, the Red Army surrounded German forces, but was instead surrounded by German forces and then cleared out. In short, the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely chaotic. German war reports also do not specify locations, but the areas involved in the fighting are in fact more suitable for the current situation. In addition, according to a correspondent stationed in the Hungarian capital, the fighting near Kursk is the most intense, with Hungarian armored units fighting alongside German forces to stop the Red Army's advance.</p>
<h3>British and Japanese Newspapers Discuss Submarine Warfare: Allied Crisis Severe</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Havas) - The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial stating that the effectiveness of submarine warfare can be explained by the following facts: During World War I, Britain once faced the danger of complete collapse. Today, the crisis facing the anti-Axis powers has also reached a very serious stage. The United States had to admit last month that 601 American ships have been lost since entering the war, most of which were sunk by German submarines. This danger has not only not disappeared, but is constantly increasing. The Allies have established a special committee to study countermeasures, but it is to no avail. Churchill, in order to reassure people, once said in a speech that German submarine activity has decreased, while Allied merchant ships are constantly increasing. However, such statements were also made during the most dangerous period for British merchant ships in 1917. Germany has now promoted Admiral Dönitz, an expert in submarine warfare, to Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, which shows Germany's determination to engage in submarine warfare with all its strength. German submarine activity will inevitably continue to intensify.</p>
<p>Bern, 13th (Havas) - The London Daily Mail published an article today, elaborating on the crisis of submarines to Allied shipping, stating that so far, the Allies have not been able to prevent enemy submarines from attacking convoys, and the various methods of bombing enemy submarine bases have also failed. In addition, due to the impact of enemy submarine attacks, domestic food shortages are becoming increasingly serious. The authorities have probably not yet fully released the exact number of Allied ship losses.</p>
<h3>Former Bulgarian Army Chief Shot Dead, Background Not Yet Ascertained</h3>
<p>Sofia, 14th (Havas) - Former Bulgarian Army Minister Rusev was shot dead in front of his residence at 9 p.m. last night.</p>
<p>Sofia, 14th (Havas) - Regarding the assassination of former Bulgarian Army Chief General Rusev, it is now known that on Saturday night, Rusev accompanied a friend home after watching the German film "Front Stage." As he was opening the door with his key, his daughter glimpsed someone outside shooting at him from inside the house. The murderer immediately ran to the door and fired several more shots at Rusev, who was lying in a pool of blood. His daughter screamed, and a street policeman responded and arrived, but the murderer had already fled, along with an accomplice. Soon after, the police chief also arrived and surrounded the area to search. The Bulgarian Army Chief and Interior Minister also arrived shortly after. The background of the case has not yet been ascertained. Bulgarian newspapers claim that the incident was carried out by Bulgaria's enemies. Rusev was 56 years old, born in Varna, and graduated from the Bulgarian Military Academy in Sofia in 1907. During World War I, he served as a artillery commander. In 1916, he was assigned to the German 185th Division. In 1934, he became commander of the Bulgarian 3rd Division and later that year became Army Chief, holding the position until January 4, 1938. During his tenure, he reorganized the Bulgarian army, making significant contributions. He is currently a leader of the Bulgarian Student National Movement.</p>
<h3>Indian Viceroy Invites Various Parties to Hold Regular Meetings to Discuss Gandhi's Hunger Strike, The Mahasabha Party Demands Immediate Release</h3>
<p>Stamford, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Indian Viceroy's office has been greatly embarrassed since Gandhi's hunger strike, so it plans to convene pro-British Indian politicians in the near future to discuss countermeasures. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, a meeting has been scheduled for the 18th in New Delhi. It is rumored that representatives from all parties and factions in India have been invited to attend, such as Rajagopalachari, the former Governor of Madras who advocates cooperation between Hindus and Muslims, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, Haq, the Governor of Bengal, Sabarkar, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Sapru, the president of the Liberal League, and George, the leader of the Central Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 14th (Havas) - News was received here last night from New Delhi that the Executive Committee of the Indian Mahasabha Party demanded the immediate release of Gandhi, as Gandhi's current hunger strike is detrimental to his physical strength. The Committee further suggested that the conflict between the government and Indian nationalists be temporarily set aside to save Gandhi's life.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Gandhi has been on hunger strike for three days. His attending physician, Dr. Major, said regarding his health condition that apart from lack of sleep, his overall health condition is still satisfactory.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Havas) - New Delhi reports that the Indian government has released the exchange of documents between the Home Secretary and Gandhi. In his letter, the Home Secretary proposed to Gandhi that he be completely free during his hunger strike, and expressed his hope that he would move out of the Aga Khan Palace detention center, and hoped that he would stop the hunger strike. The letter included a government bulletin drafted regarding this matter, but stated that if Gandhi was still on hunger strike in prison, the bulletin would not be released. Gandhi replied refusing the suggestion to temporarily restore his freedom, but said that if he was released, he could reconsider his hunger strike. He decided to go on hunger strike in prison. The Home Secretary then sent another letter to Gandhi, stating that there was no change in the Indian government's position, but since Gandhi had decided to go on hunger strike, he should take responsibility and bear the risks.</p>
<p>Vichy Worries About Gandhi's Health</p>
<p>Vichy, 13th (Havas) - Since Gandhi's hunger strike, all sectors here have been extremely anxious. In the past, Gandhi has used hunger strikes to express his political views seven times, all based on his unwavering will and indomitable spirit. However, the situation of this hunger strike is slightly different, because he is 74 years old and is often ill, with doctors by his side, so his health is worrying. According to common experience, after a hunger strike of seven or eight days, there is a risk to life, but there are also those who can survive a hunger strike of thirty or forty days. For example, in 1760, Mr. Ge Giloam suffered from illness and could not eat or drink, and was bedridden for four years. Later, he felt dry in his mouth and was fed a few drops of wine. At the time, he was in so much pain that everyone thought he would not recover. Then, a few drops of milk were given to him, and the pain gradually subsided. As a result, Ge Giloam was able to resume eating and drinking. It is generally believed by scientists that a hunger strike of 20 days will not cause an accident, especially if the person carrying out the hunger strike is motivated by passion, making them more able to persevere. This is also the same for those who have gone on hunger strikes repeatedly. According to Dr. Baogai's report on the duration of voluntary hunger strikes, Marati fasted for 50 days, Danna for 40 days, and Susi for 30 days. In recent years, hunger strikes have also occurred in the Soviet Union. The newspapers did not publish their names, but only said that someone fasted for 50 days, drank a small amount of boiled water every day, and was still able to survive, but his weight decreased by a quarter. In addition, there was also Mayor Cook, Maxwell, who died after fasting for 73 days. The Italian, Teng Ke Ge, died in prison in 1929 after fasting for 65 days. It is essential that the will is strong for those fasting. For example, after the shipwreck of the ship Medusa, all 150 passengers drifted with the waves. After four or five days, only 77 people were left, and after another seven days, only 15 people remained.</p>
<p>British-Indian Institutions Continuously Attacked</p>
<p>Stamford, 13th (Allied Press) - According to a New Delhi radio report, a total of 828 institutions under the British Indian Political Office have been set on fire or destroyed by Indian patriots since last August, including 192 police stations, 318 railway stations, and 318 telegraph and telephone offices.</p>

<h3>Wartime National Life in Various Countries (II)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ryoichi Ishii, Translated by Jingyi</p>
<p>Germany, Italy, America, England, Soviet Union</p>
<p>America</p>
<p>The United States, blessed by nature, is experiencing increasing food shortages due to wartime demand, supplies to the Allied nations, and transportation issues. Sugar consumption has been severely restricted, starting October 9th, with meatless Tuesdays. New York City, in particular, must have two meatless days per week. The import of processed beef and lamb is prohibited due to shipping constraints. These essential items have been reduced by approximately 20%. A rationing system is being planned. Sugar allocation has been reduced by about 30% due to domestic sugar production. However, due to shipping difficulties, the import of cane sugar from Java and the Philippines is impossible. Therefore, since May 4th of last year, a rationing system of half a pound per person per week has been implemented. For other canned vegetables, fruits, and other storable foods, an annual allocation of five pounds is given. Recently, coffee has also been rationed, and other materials are gradually being subjected to regulations for proper consumption. Wheat is the only item with a surplus due to overproduction; even without production for two years, it can still be self-sufficient and thus has a surplus. However, overall food prices are rising, which affects the livelihoods of the people. Therefore, on October 5th, a decree was issued to halt the rising prices of food items, using the highest prices from September 28th to October 2nd as the standard, with a temporary validity period of 60 days.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, especially wool, civilian use is almost entirely prohibited due to insufficient supply. Currently, mixed silk products are used, and the materials for both men's and women's clothing have been reduced in quality. Therefore, rayon has become very popular recently. Socks have also been significantly weakened due to the Japanese ban on raw silk exports. Other materials, such as rubber, are in short supply, so the manufacture of civilian small cars and trucks is prohibited. Rubber shoes are also subject to rationing. Car tires are not readily available, and gasoline is also rationed. Petroleum is allocated. After November, safety razors, lighters, fountain pens, powder compacts, and various shelves and other special daily necessities that require iron are successively prohibited from being manufactured. Due to the increased need for scrap iron, the slogan to destroy unused machinery is loudly proclaimed. Recently, the 10,000-ton memorial battleship Coolidge has also been decided to be dismantled to obtain 7,000 tons of scrap iron. At the same time, various scrap metal items owned by private individuals are collected. On the one hand, consumption is reduced to be a source of funds for the war. Recently, taxes have been greatly increased, such as excise taxes on cigarettes, beer, and other alcoholic beverages, all increased across the board. Cigarette taxes have increased by 20%, and a bottle of beer that cost one yuan now costs two yuan and fifty cents. The price of alcoholic beverages has increased from 22% to a high of 55%.</p>
<p>Coal is also gradually becoming insufficient. Since last winter, there have been rumors of implementing fuel conservation, reducing consumption by 25% compared to normal. In terms of housing, there is a feeling of housing scarcity in the areas of military factories. As a result, rents have also risen sharply. The government, on October 5th, limited rents and prohibited further increases. Other equipment inside homes, such as pots and kettles, are standardized with manufacturing specifications of about 60%. Judging from the restriction on the manufacture of metal products, we can imagine that the residential lives of the American people are already very difficult.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>The food problem in England is also becoming more profound day by day. The current rationed quantities are generally lower than when the rationing system was first implemented in January of the previous year. Compared to pre-war consumption, sugar has been reduced by 39%, meat by 60%, bacon, ham, and margarine by 66.7%, butter by 52%, cheese by 33%, and black tea by 66%. The recent allocation is 32 grams of sugar, 8 grams of cheese, 32 grams of butter, 15 grams of lard, 8 grams of tea, 73 grams of beef, and 16 grams of pork per person per day. Among these, the monthly allocation of sugar is about 1.6 catties, which is about three times the 0.6 catties allocated to urban dwellers in Japan per month. However, the average British citizen consumes a lot of sugar daily. If it is reduced to about 40% of the normal consumption, the impact would be too great. Although this allocation system is still maintained recently, it is actually difficult to buy. It will be more difficult in the future. Other items such as butter, lard, fruits, and meat will also become difficult to buy. The biggest reason for the reduction in butter is that New Zealand, the world's only butter-producing region, cannot ship its products. Similarly, fruits cannot be shipped from Australia. In addition, rice, beans, and dried noodles will soon be rationed. Only bread, milk, and vegetables are not yet rationed, but bread is no longer available on the market. Milk has been under control since October of the previous year. As for eggs, there are only two or three per month.</p>
<p>Ordinary restaurants or large cafes can superficially be freely patronized, but each meal is limited to three dishes, not exceeding five shillings at most. Therefore, there is a great shortage of items in first-class hotels now. Occasionally, a dried orange is placed on the table, and everyone considers it very precious and cheers in unison. Under these circumstances, the soaring value of food items is, of course, conceivable. To curb rising prices, the government has allocated 140 million pounds to handle this matter, but the extent to which it can be suppressed is still a question.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, such as wool and cotton clothing, which used to be shipped from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, is now impossible. Therefore, the national life has been greatly affected. At that time, for the sake of economy, each person was allocated 66 points of clothing vouchers per year, later changed to 60 points, and now it has been further reduced. A suit of clothes costs 26 points, shoes 5 points, a shirt 5 points, socks 1 point, an undershirt 3 points, a towel 1 point, and underwear 3 points.</p>
<p>Other materials, such as iron, are lacking, so iron products are being collected on a large scale. Antiques and utensils containing a certain amount of iron are registered and prohibited from being transferred. All existing goods exceeding three tons are requisitioned, and a large-scale collection campaign is underway to reach a quantity of 10,000 tons. Recently, the iron window grilles and other iron materials in the primary school next to Edinburgh have been almost completely dismantled, and the iron doors in the air-raid shelters have also been successively recovered. The situation of such a lack of iron can be imagined. In addition, the recovery campaign of metals such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, cupronickel, and aluminum has also been implemented.</p>
<p>To save fuel and rubber, the use of private cars is prohibited. At the same time, to alleviate the increase in transportation volume, various discounted tickets for recreational travel were abolished on October 5th. The number of trips parents made to visit their refugee children has also been reduced from six to three since last winter, and there are rumors of prohibiting the operation of long-distance buses. Household coal is registered, and those who violate the rules will have their supply stopped. Last winter, the Fuel Department ordered that the winter household coal consumption allocation be reduced to four million tons. From government offices to banks, companies, and theaters, the use of heating was uniformly prohibited in October. This year, the use of heating is only allowed from December. Theaters, cinemas, and stores are also closing earlier.</p>
<p>Regarding the coal shortage problem, according to the British economic magazine, the estimated shortage is 44 million tons. After saving consumption, 10 million tons can be saved. The rest will be compensated for by increasing production. However, incidents such as strikes and work stoppages by coal miners are expanding daily, so summoning workers is also a very difficult problem. Although the government intends to nationalize the mining industry to some extent, managed by the government, and allow workers to demand higher wages, the effect is still very limited. Therefore, the public extremely criticizes the government's policy of recalling soldiers serving in the military from the front line to work in mining, as well as various other government measures. The government had no choice but to mobilize young people aged 18 to 25 to engage in mining in order to increase coal production. At the same time, it mobilized news and broadcasting to promote fuel conservation efforts. The lack of fuel has a great impact on the war. Other items such as paper are also in short supply, so the number of newspaper pages has been reduced. Envelopes are even being turned over and reused for the second time.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's main food items, such as flour, do not seem to be a major problem, but the supply of side dishes is far worse than before the war. We can see this from the following table showing the rations of the rationing system implemented in various places in July of the previous year.</p>
<p>A, representing muscular laborers and technicians;</p>
<p>B, representing general employees;</p>
<p>C, representing housewives and travelers;</p>
<p>D, representing children under 12 and the elderly.</p>
<p>Bread is calculated on a daily basis, and other items are calculated on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>As of now, the bread ration has not changed, but dry noodles have been reduced by 40%, sugar and desserts by 60%, and butter and meat (including fish) by half. But this quantity is often not actually available. To buy food, you are supposed to go to state-owned stores, but they are often sold out quickly. If you go to the free market, you can buy one kilo of butter for only 20 rubles in state-owned stores, but here, it costs 700 rubles. Other foods that do not require vouchers are not available in state-owned stores, so even though you know the prices are high, you have to go to the free market to buy them.</p>
<p>Clothing materials are rationed at the same time as food. Each person is issued a ration coupon once every six months. The allocation is 25 points for laborers and technicians, 100 points for general employees, and 80 points for children, the elderly, and others without a fixed occupation. Cotton and silk fabrics are 10 points per meter, leather shoes are 30 points, outerwear and other clothing items; wool fabrics are 80 points, cotton fabrics are 60 points, shirts are 10 to 12 points, and socks are 2 points. But the manufacture of clothes has almost completely stopped, so although there are vouchers in name, they are practically zero. However, the Soviet people had prepared for these kinds of items before the war, so they can still manage to use them for now.</p>
<p>The soap allocation is one bar of perfumed soap and one bar of laundry soap each month. In addition, paper and matches are also very scarce.</p>
<p>Coal is also a problem. Since the Donbass coal mine was occupied by Germany, the lack of coal has intensified. As a result, the coal allocation has been reduced by 60%, and electricity has been reduced by 30%. Since last winter, heating has also been reduced accordingly. In terms of housing: in cities in the free zone, there is also a feeling of housing scarcity due to the sharp increase in the refugee population. The population of cities in Siberia has doubled, and residents of Moscow who have moved inland are ordered to surrender their homes for others to live in and are prohibited from moving back. Some cities even prohibit travel to alleviate the housing problem.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief statement of the national life of Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In short, materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How will the people be able to endure this? We must know that in this extraordinary period, no matter what, we must cultivate sufficient endurance because this is the foundation for us to prepare our domestic system to achieve the final victory!

<h3>Germany's New Tax Laws Not Yet Implemented; Considering Taxing Industry</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The new tax laws recently announced by German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk have not yet been implemented and are still under discussion. However, it is understood that those with an income of more than 8,000 marks will be subject to new taxes. The past wartime surtax only accounted for 50% of income tax, but it may be doubled in the future. The extent of the increase in business tax is not yet known. The authorities are currently considering taxing industry. If so, Germany's revenue could increase by 2,500,000,000 marks. Those who own real estate will also pay the same taxes, estimated to total 8,000,000,000 marks. At the same time, the government's value payments to the armaments industry are reduced, which can save hundreds of thousands of marks each year. The purpose of the new tax laws is to limit excessive private income and reduce the national debt. The deposits of German public savings banks increased from 15,000,000,000 marks to 50,000,000,000 marks in 1942. This amount has been absorbed by the state to be used as war expenses and paid with public bonds with an interest rate of 3.5%. Germany's war expenses in 1943 will obviously increase. In the past, 50% of Germany's war expenses came from borrowing, and the other 50% came from taxes and other national income. The total amount of Germany's income in the fiscal year from April 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943, was 50,000,000,000 marks. During the same period, Germany's war expenses amounted to 100,000,000,000 marks. The countries occupied by the German army, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and former Poland contributed approximately 14,000,000,000 marks to the German treasury.</p>

<p>Manchukuo, as the guardian of Japan's northern flank and a supplier of food, light metals, and iron ore, is cooperating with Japan to complete the great undertaking of war. On January 16th, three hundred members of the reporting team gathered at the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Xinjing. From that day forward, they began a life of motorcades, with all aspects of their daily routines and movements based on military standards. After five days of preparatory education, they departed on the 21st for the Manchu-Soviet border, visiting the foremost surveillance posts of the local units guarding the border to concretely inspect their living conditions. The reporter, as the leader of the sixth team, visited various units on the front lines of the Heihe Province border area and learned about the reality of the defense there. This occurred during the coldest period of the continuous blockade, and looking out at the rivers and mountains covered in ice and snow, an infinite sense of emotion welled up within me.</p>
<p>Lonely Border Landscape</p>
<p>In the night of northern Manchuria, the moon shines brightly, illuminating the earth. Soldiers on patrol, their boots crunching on the snow, emit a soft metallic sound. Standing on the northern bank of the 〇〇 River, covered in snow, and gazing towards the opposite bank, the city across the river lies silent in the bright moonlight. The extreme cold, tens of degrees below zero, freezes everything into an icy stillness. To the downstream left bank, there is the light of a flashing electric lamp, suggesting that someone lives there. The eternally flowing Heilong River is a river that embodies the history of the long struggle between the Slavic and East Asian peoples over 2,300 years. What is now seen is merely a stretch of greyish-white ice and snow, silently flowing after freezing, which is the long border, eight hundred meters wide and winding like a ribbon. On this border line, there is no barbed wire, but not even an ant could pass.</p>
<p>The sunset in Manchuria is as blood-red as the morning sun. On the roofs and glass windows of the various red, white, and blue buildings in the city across the river, sunlight glimmers. From the tall chimneys, wisps of white smoke curl in the cold wind. On the avenue along the riverbank, and in the gaps of the birch forest, it seems that vehicles and horses are passing by. Apart from the three patrolling soldiers who stomp around on the ice, there is no sign of other people.</p>
<p>Three Invisible Enemies</p>
<p>Each unit treats the reporting team members with the utmost courtesy. One unit prepared a feast of meat and wine, using their limited sugar to make steamed buns, eagerly awaiting our arrival. They got up at 4:00 AM to prepare the meal, because each reporting team member is backed by the people of their hometown, and you can sense the flavor of home on them. The lives of the soldiers in remote borderlands, enduring such extreme cold in desolate villages, can be seen here in a glimpse. The soldiers defending the northern frontier must struggle against three invisible enemies: the frigid climate, local diseases, and the constant need to maintain vigilance even without war, that is, the mental struggle of their duties. The soldiers of the local army completely overcome these enemies. They do not consider the severe cold to be anything special; even forty degrees below zero is considered normal. This is due to (1) the completeness of their cold-weather gear, (2) the training and thorough preparation for frostbite prevention, and (3) habituation to the climate. Although the first year is difficult, after two or three years, the extremely cold climate becomes commonplace, and frostbite is not even noticed, but cases of frostbite are extremely rare. The early trees are completely frozen, and exhaled breath turns into white smoke. Frost flowers grow on the edges of the cold-weather hats, and the wind-blown snowflakes feel like cuts on the face. Under such extremely cold conditions, without an unimaginable mental strength and training, ordinary people would be unable to endure it. The forging of being able to treat the extreme cold as if it were normal can be imagined.</p>
<p>Although there is no war, the need to maintain vigilance on the front lines causes tremendous fatigue on both the mind and body. Therefore, the commanders of each unit pay close attention to mental training and physical exercise, not allowing a moment of relaxation. Every morning and after dinner, they conduct calisthenics while also teaching the art of the sword, and hold various sports competitions to shift interests and exercise the body. In other aspects, they also prepare various entertainment facilities, adapting to the different seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and spend time in the wilderness with nature, pouring out continuous efforts.</p>
<p>Cultivating the Fields for Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>Soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, and company commanders often hold forums to report on the actual conditions of army life in the area. In any situation, first, they train themselves not to shrink from hard work due to the cold. You will not hear anyone complaining about any inconvenience or deficiency in their personal lives. Personal matters are dismissed with a laugh and not mentioned again. Is this not the true life of selfless dedication to public service? In view of the domestic situation, the unit commanders told the local army to implement a policy of self-sufficiency. In addition to relentless and rigorous training, they also engage in farming, animal husbandry, and making tofu and horse fodder, putting in tremendous effort, and gradually achieving success. The bread made by the 〇〇 Unit has a reputation as the best in the north and is the most treasured item for visitors. Each unit also plans to conserve resources, and to adjust the monotonous life in the army, they encourage effort and creative research, planning to improve life in poverty and promote the spirit of respecting resources.</p>
<p>The gate of one unit completely utilizes the elasticity of birch wood to create a simple automatic locking device. The 〇〇 Unit planted elegant birch trees in the four corners of the courtyard, creating a small and exquisite garden. The 〇〇 Unit makes straw sandals. The 〇〇 Unit held an exhibition of slogans for the anniversary of the Great War, with many excellent works. Exquisite furniture made of birch wood can be seen in every unit.</p>
<p>Respect for resources is followed by encouragement of savings. For example, one team from the 〇〇 Unit has already reached 25,000 yuan, and the highest individual amount is 350 yuan.</p>
<p>Harmonious Feelings Among Soldiers</p>
<p>Harmony among soldiers is the foundation of the Japanese army's strength. Especially in the northern Manchurian border area, geographically isolated from other places, the soldiers are very harmonious with each other, and especially with their superiors. Company commanders unanimously explain their loving position to the soldiers, sharing their joys and sorrows. The misfortune of one soldier is comforted by the entire company. Officers operate in the fields like soldiers and often hold picnics, trying to find happiness during the short spring and summer seasons of northern Manchuria. Company commanders often tell jokes so that the soldiers do not feel a sense of hierarchy. One unit said, "When we were trainees, we slept in the open fields. Now we have such magnificent barracks, complete facilities, and ample supplies. To complain about poverty would be too much."</p>
<p>One non-commissioned officer said, "No matter how cold it is, we have such complete cold-weather gear, and the food and drinks are abundant, so we should work harder so as not to let down those back home."</p>
<p>Looking out over thousands of miles, the ground is frozen solid. The soldiers endure constant training in this wilderness border, and the barracks, provisions, and entertainment are not sufficient, but they do not express dissatisfaction. This kind of humility, the difficult military life in the northern frontier, is completely different from the comfort of a warm and peaceful inland life. We, who visited the area, strongly felt the tension.</p>
<p>The Hundred Flowers of Spring in Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>The long winter has passed, and the spring of a hundred blooming flowers is about to descend on northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>Near the barracks, on the mountains, and by the roadside, it will become a field of flowers.</p>
<p>The officers in heavy fur coats and felt boots will see a frozen land, the stinging north wind and powdered snow, and the rustling sound of walking will all become associations in name only. The purple anemone, called the "welcoming spring flower," stretches out its pitiful branches on the ground in April, where the remaining snow is tightly packed. The flowers that bloom in the mainland from spring to mid-autumn all open their buds together. The flower garden of the Japanese Alps is now in front of the barracks here. The soldiers' whiskers, grown out due to the spring breeze (turning into icicles in winter), are growing. All the windows of the barracks are open, and the empty cans and beer bottles in each room are filled with unknown wildflowers. Spring has arrived!</p>
<p>The soldiers of the local units are calmly accumulating a force for certain victory. But the northern Manchurian border is connected to the distant southern battlefields. Morning and evening are facing each other, and the flowing Heilong River winds through a 1,300-mile-long transparent iron wall, struggling with nature and one's own spirit. This is a silent battlefield. (Sho Translated from the February 7th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Snow Falls in Several Locations in Tunisia; Two Axis Units Have Met: Concentrating Forces to Maintain Lines of Communication</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – A German military dispatch today stated that there was only localized fighting in North Africa yesterday. German aircraft bombed the port of Benghazi and Libyan border troops.</p>
<p>Rome, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military announced that Italian troops in Tunisia repelled two enemy attacks yesterday, destroying two enemy aircraft. Three Italian aircraft have not returned in the past four days.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from North Africa, the Finan Emme and Rommel armies of the Axis forces in Tunisia have now joined forces in the corridor area. According to reliable information, several groups of Axis forces are now in close communication and will completely thwart any attempts by the anti-Axis forces to counterattack. It appears that the northern region also has a large number of troops to guard against a fierce attack on the ports of Bizerte and Tunis by the British First Army. A group of forces is also stationed in the southwestern region of Tunisia, and a large number of mechanized units are stationed near Faid in the east to the eastern coast to ensure communication lines between northern and southern Tunisia. The Axis forces in southern Tunisia are also on high alert, and the offensive of the British Eighth Army and the anti-Axis forces in the southwest has no opportunity.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from North Africa, the situation in Tunisia remains unchanged. Due to the harsh climate, no large-scale battles have occurred in any area. Heavy snow fell suddenly in several locations in Tunisia on the 12th. According to Cairo, rain and snow mixed on the front lines, hindering the operations of the anti-Axis forces. However, according to another dispatch, reconnaissance battles have been quite active across the entire line in the past forty-eight hours. It is reported that Axis forces near Ousseltia in the central region have launched a fierce attack on the anti-Axis positions, but details are unknown. Although air force activity is limited, Axis air forces still sortie in adverse weather, prying into and bombing anti-Axis troop bases in the De Arada area, and bombing the ports of Puji and Bono. Two ships and port facilities were set on fire.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, February 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to the Stefani News Agency in Rome, the Axis forces in Tunisia are currently holding their positions and firmly occupy the entire east coast, where the defenses are extremely strong. The terrain in Tunisia is easier to defend than in Libya, and the Axis forces have no major difficulties in obtaining supplies. Once the cold season passes, the frontline fighting will become more active.</p>
<h3>Comments from Various Countries After Roosevelt's Speech</h3>
<p>(Germany) Berlin, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Berlin newspapers believe that President Roosevelt's recent speech aimed to reduce the opposition within the country. It has the same meaning as Churchill's speech in the House of Commons. Although the opinions of the leaders of the United Nations are extremely divided, they seem to agree on the plan to hand Europe over to the Bolsheviks. The Berlin Evening News commented that Roosevelt's statement that Germany's enemies intend to completely destroy the German nation and European culture is true. Stalin is also a shrewd man who will certainly cultivate his strength to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Berlin has expressed its views on Roosevelt's extensive speech on the 12th, believing that Roosevelt's confidence that the anti-Axis forces will drive the Axis forces out of North Africa and launch an offensive on the European continent within the year, while admitting the strength of the Axis positions in Tunisia, is contradictory. It should be noted that the Axis forces do not care about the defeat of the troops at Dunkirk. As for those who dream of invading Europe, they are simply showing their ignorance. The coastal defenses of Europe today are very different from those in North Africa.</p>
<p>(Italy) Rome, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – There is little attention paid here to President Roosevelt's recent speech, merely stating that the Axis powers are completely calm in the face of the great war declared by Roosevelt. Romans consider Roosevelt's speech to be a "Hollywood-style" speech, so it is not important. The recent speech revealed some interesting facts: First, the American people do not yet understand the purpose of this war. Therefore, the various restrictions imposed by the American government have aroused popular resentment. Second, Roosevelt's speech confirmed the seriousness of the American economic situation. Social unrest, strikes, conflicts, and the crisis of communism are emerging one after another. Third, Roosevelt admitted that the United States has discovered defeatists, demoralized people, and social contradictions. We deeply believe in the victory Roosevelt mentioned. On the contrary, the American people are deeply worried about the crisis of the Bolshevik alliance. After the Bolsheviks achieve victory, the United States will lose all of its foreign trade, which alone is enough to make those who enthusiastically support Roosevelt lose their enthusiasm. In short, Roosevelt's speech not only clearly expressed the disappointment of the American people, but also proved Roosevelt's failure in war propaganda.</p>
<h3>Soviet General to the US</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 14th (Allied News Agency) – According to a report from Rio de Janeiro, a Soviet lieutenant general and a naval admiral passed through Natal and Brazil two days ago. According to yesterday's news, they are on their way to the United States.</p>
<p>Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from South America, a Soviet military delegation arrived in Natal, Brazil, by plane on the 13th and is said to be traveling to another location. The delegation is composed of four generals and one admiral from Marshal Timoshenko's command, but the mission and destination of the delegation are not clear.</p>
<h3>Uruguayan Parliament Regains Power</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Montevideo, the Uruguayan Parliament will regain power after the elections in December. The Council of State, established a year ago, has been dissolved. The Uruguayan Council of State was established on February 22, 1942, by order of President Baldomir, to replace the duties of Parliament. At that time, Parliament was closed due to conflicts between political parties.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Convenes Military Conference</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, US President Roosevelt convened a meeting at the White House on the 13th with Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations King, and Chief of Staff Leahy, the president's personal chief of staff, and other top army and navy officials. The content of the meeting has not yet been clarified, but it is speculated that it was to discuss new anti-Axis operations after the Casablanca conference.</p>
<h3>Demonstrations in Cuba</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from Cuba, anti-government demonstrations have occurred in several major cities in the country. In one city, a police station fired shots, injuring many rioters. All shops have been closed.</p>
<h3>All Argentine Cinemas to Close</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 13th (Havas News Agency) – The Argentine film industry is in danger of shutting down due to the cessation of film supply. Before the war, most of the films screened in the country came from Germany, but later the country switched to purchasing films from the United States, but with little success. Therefore, cinemas across the country are likely to be forced to close. However, no fewer than 15,000 people depend on this for a living, and it is expected that their livelihoods will be difficult after the closure.</p>
<h3>Shortage of US Materials</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to the New York Times, the US Bureau of Mines recently announced a new invention of a mixed fuel of coal and petroleum as a substitute for industrial fuel oil. Boilers that have always used oil can use this new fuel without modification and can save 35% of oil consumption. However, the only problem is that turning the kerosene mixed with petroleum into powder requires a large number of coal crushers, so it is not suitable when the demand is urgent. According to a dispatch from Los Angeles, a countermeasure to remedy the shortage of tin has been invented, a container that does not use tin at all.</p>
<h3>Reported Martial Law Throughout Iraq, Frequent Riots in Damascus</h3>
<p>Istanbul, February 14th (Central News Agency) – It is reported that martial law has been declared throughout Iraq.</p>
<p>Stockholm, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from the United Kingdom, riots have occurred frequently in the Damascus city area recently, resulting in one death and several injuries. Many people have been arrested and deported. The Syrian authorities have issued a statement denouncing "troublemakers" who are inciting popular emotions over the bread issue.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Formed in Albania</h3>
<p>Tirana, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – After the Albanian cabinet resigned, the Albanian Governor has ordered the formation of a new cabinet, and Bushati has been appointed as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Rome, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The new Albanian cabinet has been sworn in. The list of cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister and Interim Leader of the Albanian Fascist Party Bushati, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works Amici, Minister of Propaganda and Minister of Justice Heciti, Minister of Interior Gjon Markagjoni, Minister of Finance Marko, Minister of Education Krasniki, Minister of Industry and Commerce Xheloga, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Miraj, and State Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office Koba.</p>
<h3>Former German Kaiser Wilhelm's Second Son Divorces His Wife</h3>
<p>Berlin, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – News here yesterday that Prince Louis Ferdinand, the second son of former German Kaiser Wilhelm, has divorced his wife. Prince Louis Ferdinand is currently a captain in the German Air Force. His wife is a famous beauty in Berlin. When the two married a year ago, it caused a sensation in Berlin society. This divorce was obtained with the consent of both parties. After the divorce, the wife will join the army or work in a factory.</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Industrial Conference</h3>
<p>Budapest, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Key figures from the German and Romanian industrial sectors held a conference here from February 9th to 14th to discuss plans to increase Romanian industrial production.</p>
<h3>Turkey's Neutral Policy Unchanged: Extension for Ambassador to Soviet Union to Return to Post; Turkey and Romania Sign Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Ankara, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible officials here deny reports that Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hacıkalın, left for the Soviet Union the day before yesterday. They declare that Hacıkalın will extend his stay before returning to his post.</p>
<p>Ankara, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – For months, Britain and the United States have been spreading rumors about the signing of a Soviet-Turkish friendship treaty. When Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hacıkalın, returns to his post at the beginning of this week, the rumors will resurface. Informed sources here believe that Soviet-Turkish relations have been clarified by the Ahlat Declaration and will not be changed by a new treaty. The Turkish government issued a declaration of neutrality when the German-Soviet war broke out. The Soviet government also issued a declaration on August 13, 1941, denying any intention of aggression or territorial claims against Turkey. The above declarations still have a decisive force on Soviet-Turkish relations. Turkish officials acknowledge that British and American diplomats in Ankara are making every effort to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey closer together. However, Turkey believes that approaching the Soviet Union violates the neutral policy stipulated in the Turkish declaration of neutrality of June 22, 1941. Britain and the United States are spreading rumors, trying to alienate German-Turkish relations. However, after the Soviet Union launched its winter offensive, the Turkish authorities and the public became increasingly aware of the threat of Bolshevism. Turkey does not want to take steps that weaken the European anti-communist front. According to the Turkish government party newspaper "Ulus," Churchill's declaration on the Adana Conference is consistent with the Turkish official statement. This meeting does not target any country. Churchill has once again elaborated on the usefulness of Turkish neutrality. Turkey believes that maintaining neutrality is beneficial to all countries involved, and Churchill shares this sentiment.</p>
<p>Istanbul, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Turkey and Romania signed a commercial treaty in Ankara on the 2nd of this month, stipulating that Romania will supply Turkey with 49,000 tons of kerosene, and Turkey will supply Romania with copper, wool textiles, and olive oil. Other trade must also be authorized by the responsible authorities of both countries.</p>

<p>Rally Declaration, Slogans, and Banners</p>
<p>(1) Declaration: The National Government declared war on England and America on January 9th. We feel infinite excitement and hope. History tells us that Anglo-American imperialism is our irreconcilable enemy. On December 8th of the year before last, our friendly neighbor Japan raised the righteous banner of liberating East Asia and fought desperately with Anglo-American imperialism in the Pacific with all of its national manpower and material resources. For more than a year, Japan has won victory after victory, and the aggressive forces of England and America in East Asia have been completely driven out. East Asia has restored its original appearance and has become East Asia for East Asians. We remember that when the Greater East Asia War broke out, our government declared that it would work with Japan in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to seek the complete liberation of East Asia. Now, although Anglo-American imperialism has become an arrow at the end of its flight and is about to collapse, the great war is not yet over, and our freedom cannot be guaranteed in the safest way. Since we are a member of East Asia, and this war is a matter of life and death for us, then we should naturally take out all of our strength and fight to the death with our friendly neighbor Japan against Anglo-American imperialism. Therefore, the government's declaration of war on England and America is entirely a decision based on the objective situation. From now on, we should fight with England and America with the determination to die together and completely eliminate all aggressive forces in East Asia. As long as Anglo-American imperialism does not completely collapse, our survival and independent freedom will not be guaranteed. We must fight England and America, we must fight England and America. Let us unite and support the National Government's official war against England and America. (2) Slogans: (1) Support joining the war; (2) Overthrow England and America; (3) China and Japan work together to complete the Greater East Asia War; (4) Revive China; (5) Defend East Asia; (6) Long live Chairman Wang; (7) Long live the Republic of China; (3) Banners: (1) Obey the leader, dedicate everything to the country; (2) China and Japan work together to complete the Greater East Asia War; (3) Support joining the war, complete the wartime system; (4) Expand the forces of peace, liberate the compatriots trampled under Jiang's Communist Party; (5) Overthrow England and America, defend East Asia; (6) Complete peace, realize peace; (7) Overthrow England and America; (8) Revive China.</p>
<h3>Municipal Propaganda Department Held a Symposium of Cultural Figures Yesterday; Mayor Chen and Minister Lin Personally Presided; Various Cultural Figures Enthusiastically Expressed Their Opinions</h3>
<p>Instructed to rebuild culture, with the national and ethnic state as the greatest goal of the cultural world's efforts in the future, the Municipal Government and the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office held a symposium of cultural figures in this city at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Duchen Hotel on Tingxi Road. Mayor Chen Gongbo and Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng personally participated and presided over the meeting. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>List of Attendees</p>
<p>In addition to Mayor Chen Gongbo and Minister Lin Bosheng, Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Ming Gan, Director of the Jiangsu Propaganda Office, Secretary Ma Zongyao, Ling Dating of the Municipal Government, and the city's cultural figures Zhu Pu, Chen Binhe, Zhou Yueran, Huang Jingwan, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Liang Shi, Wu Beizhi, Yang Huilang, Wang Ping, Pan Yuqie, Liu Yusheng, Liu Tong, Zhang Yian, Bao Tianxiao, Sun Choucheng, Zheng Yimei, Gu Fengcheng, Yang Guangzheng, Yang Zhihua, Ping Jinya, Chen Dieyi, Zheng Jie, Wu Chengzhi, Qiu Shimu, Chen Zhengfan, Wu Yisheng, Tao Qin, Ma Mingfeng, Lei Dun, Zhu Musong, Nai Liang, Hu Sian, Cheng Yiping, Gao Yin, Shen Diewei, Du Liang, Feng Heyi, Qian Gongxia, Gu Lengguan, Lv Baihua, Chen Binghong, Qin Shouou, Sui Sheng, Jiang Kehou, Yang Li, Zuo Junsheng, Tao Diya, He, Xue Xiaoyun, Wen Zaidao, etc., and female writer Guan Lu and others, no less than 70 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>A tea party was held at 10:00 a.m., and Mayor Chen, as chairman, reported the significance of convening a symposium of cultural figures, saying that it was rare to be able to chat with everyone today. Minister Lin and I have long wanted to talk with you, and it has only been realized today. This conversation is not about formal expression, but about understanding the true opinions of everyone, and soliciting everyone's expressions on the national cultural factory knot. I hope that everyone will provide full opinions. I once met with everyone two or three months ago, but it was not such a grand gathering. It was even more difficult to meet before. However, in the cultural journals and newspapers, I have read your masterpieces. Today, Minister Lin and I, in the dual capacity of hosts, meet with you to hear your valuable opinions and seek the reconstruction of today's culture. I hope everyone will speak frankly and give full play to their ideas. It was decided that Minister Lin would give a speech.</p>
<p>The main points of Lin's speech are as follows: (1) Since the Incident, the cultural world has felt difficulties in its career and life. I am responsible for promoting culture, but I have not been able to relieve your pain, which is regrettable. (2) Chinese culture was already lagging behind before the Incident, and it has become more chaotic after the Incident. (3) How to rebuild the foundation of Chinese culture, and how to establish a position for us to stand in relation to East Asia and the world, are all issues that we should review. (4) He pointed out the fallacy of the past Chinese cultural world in the ideological struggle between the old and new factions. (5) It is necessary to establish that the greatest goal of Chinese culture should be the nation and the ethnic group. Since China has suffered from the aggression of British and American culture for the past 100 years, and has also been poisoned by Communist ideology for the past 20 years, it has been the greatest blow to Chinese culture. We should clean it up from the standpoint of the nation and the ethnic group, promote Chinese culture, and eradicate the poisonous effects of British and American aggressive ideology and Communist ideology. (6) To promote cultural undertakings during the war, such as the difficulty of paper and the difficulty of publishing the works of cultural figures, the Propaganda Department should make an overall plan to solve the problem. (7) The organization of the Cultural Association should be accelerated, unite sincerely, jointly promote the development of cultural professions, and jointly seek the improvement of life. (8) I hope that all cultural figures will stand on the position of the nation and the ethnic group and do their best. I will work with you to move forward.</p>
<p>Details of the Discussion</p>
<p>(A) Chen Binhe raised the serious nature of the current cultural publishing industry: (1) He requested that the government collect paper and implement a unified system of control and distribution to the cultural publishing industry to prevent hoarding and monopoly; (2) He advocated the use of local paper to make up for the shortage and consumption of newspaper paper; (3) He improved the living conditions of cultural figures, and asked the authorities to plan a cooperative to distribute daily necessities so that cultural figures can obtain life guarantees under the guidance of the Propaganda Department and do their best for wartime culture. (B) Yang Guangzheng proposed: (1) The mistake of Chinese cultural figures in the past was the lack of a mainstream of thought and the division of factions; (2) Seeking the coordination of culture and politics; (3) With the assistance of the authorities, seeking the realization of unity and organization of cultural figures, guaranteeing their lives, and rewarding their writings. (C) Zheng Han proposed that in order to realize the goal of struggling for culture, he hoped that the authorities would expand large-scale bookstores or add official and civilian-run large bookstores to develop the production of writing. (D) Pan Yuqie proposed: (1) Writers, editors and publishers should be integrated, because articles and people cannot be separated; (2) Break the life of cultural workers as beasts of burden, hoping that the authorities will subsidize writers when they have difficulties and illnesses; (3) Break the concept of writers as laborers and stipulate the lowest royalty for writers' works; (4) Hope that the authorities will reward writers and encourage them to create writings. (E) Liu Yusheng's program, (F) Wen Zaidao's opinions. Implement measures to eliminate pornography to avoid wasting paper and harming young people's thoughts. Yu Zhou Yueran, Gu Zhijian and others also made suggestions.</p>
<p>Final Conclusion</p>
<p>At the end, Mayor Chen made a conclusion, roughly saying, "The high theories raised by everyone present today can be divided into three points in summary: (1) The lack of printing materials in the cultural world has been explained in detail by Minister Lin, who is planning an overall solution, which will be implemented by the Propaganda Department; (2) The living problem of cultural figures is very important. This kind of difficulty is not only seen in today's situation, but also has always existed in the past. In order to solve the difficulties of cultural figures, I hope that cultural institutions can be quickly established in the future, and the government or organizations will strive to solve the lives of cultural figures so that everyone can create the most valuable works under the conditions of a stable life and establish the foundation of their life's profession; (3) How can the writing of cultural figures achieve the highest goal of the nation and the ethnic group? Looking back over the past ten years, the writing in the country has shown progress in terms of technology, but the content of the works is mostly (1) taking things related to the author's individual as the subject matter; (2) exposing the dark side of society. We have not seen anything that can truly represent the nation and the ethnic group. The official department is also drafting a wartime cultural program, and I hope everyone will contribute as much as possible to meet the needs of the present and the future, and take on the responsibility of completing works that can truly represent the nation and the ethnic group." Finally, tea and snacks were served, and the meeting ended happily at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>At the Speech Meeting of Government and Civilian Cadres, Minister Lin Promoted National Policy; More Than 500 Government and Civilian Cadres Attended</h3>
<p>The Central Government specially dispatched Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng, accompanied by Director Zhong Renlai, etc., to Shanghai in order to promote the significance of the National Government's participation in the war. The "Support Joining the War, Overthrow England and America Shanghai Special Municipality Government and Civilian Cadres Speech Meeting" was jointly hosted by the Municipal Government, the Social Movement Committee, and the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those present included government officials Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng, Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Ling Dating, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, Chen Dongbai of the Shanghai Office of the Social Movement Committee, Sun Wuqi, Director of the Municipal Social Movement Committee, Hu Shouqi, Deputy Director, Lin Jiongan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Ye Xuesong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Ling Xianwen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Enlin, Director of the Public Works Bureau, etc., and the directors of the Central Government's offices in Shanghai, the directors of various bureaus in Shanghai, various industry associations, vocational associations, principals of large and small schools, and more than 500 representatives from various social groups and newspaper reporters. Director Sun Wuqi first gave a welcome speech, followed by Minister Lin Bosheng's speech on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war, expressing a grand theory.</p>
<p>Minister Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Lin gave a two-hour speech on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war at the Support Joining the War Rally, entitled "The Significance of Our Country's Participation in the War." He thoroughly explained why China should participate in the war, why the Greater East Asia War occurred, the future of China and East Asia, the changes in the international situation in recent years, and the strength of China's participation in the war. The whole audience listened attentively and was deeply moved. In the tense and solemn atmosphere, applause was incessant. The main points of the speech are as follows: First, it is stated that China's participation in the war and the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War are based on historical destiny. For a hundred years, China has encountered crises under the oppression of Anglo-American imperialism, and all Asian nations have also suffered from the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism. From the observation of world history and geography for the past two or three hundred years, the result of the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism has been the change of colors on the map, and the weaker nations have been forced into slavery. The crisis in Asia, China and Japan are tied to a common destiny. The enlightened Japan, after the success of the Meiji Restoration, began to lift the shackles of unequal treaties, while China has procrastinated until now, which shows that the security of China and Japan is shared, without Japan there is no China, and without China there is no Japan." The Founding Father's teaching once pointed out the truth.</p>
<p>Revive China, Liberate East Asia</p>
<p>Secondly, it is stated that at the beginning of the National Revolution, the fundamental policy was determined to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. In accordance with the Founding Father's teaching, China and Japan should cooperate sincerely. Since the Kuomintang unified the country, the revolutionary line should follow the road of East Asian liberation, and unite the nations of East Asia to settle accounts with the Anglo-American imperialists. Therefore, the Chinese National Revolution and the Japanese Restoration were historically to settle accounts with England and America, and the Greater East Asia War was a total settlement of the East Asian nations with England and America. Originally, to settle accounts with England and America, we should only seek the mutual unity of China and Japan. However, looking back, not only did we fail to liberate the East Asian nations, but we were instead provoked and alienated by the Anglo-American imperialists, resulting in the Sino-Japanese Incident. The situation between China and Japan failed to ease in time, resulting in fraternal strife. However, we firmly believe that the truth of the East Asian nations uniting to settle accounts with England and America will surely be realized one day. Until Chairman Wang left Chongqing and issued a telegram, initiating the peace movement, China and Japan should only be friends, not enemies. The survival of China and the security of Japan are tied to a common destiny. Therefore, the revolution in China must have a peace movement.</p>
<p>Total Participation in the War, Settling Blood Debts</p>
<p>The practice of peace movement leads to participation in the war, taking on the responsibility of defending East Asia, and working with our friendly neighbor Japan in the Greater East Asia War to settle historical blood debts. After three years of hard work in the peace movement, under the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, we removed the yellow cloth sign and saw the blue sky, white sun, and crimson earth flag again. Finally, with regard to the significance of the total war, we explained the strength of our country's participation in the war after the National Government announced its participation in the war. In the end, it was said that this war is a war for the survival of China, Japan, and all East Asian nations. We can only win and not lose. In the event of failure, China will be reduced to the second India. Whether or not there is certainty in this war depends on the military situation and political strength. In terms of military affairs, our friendly neighbor Japan has adopted a strategy of turning from offense to defense, laying the foundation for victory, and has obtained an absolute advantage, which is beyond doubt. Therefore, political strength only seeks the close unity of the East Asian nations, which should be no problem. We should participate in the war with all our strength, and the loyal and brave warriors in the rear should work hard and sweat, and the brave and self-sacrificing soldiers in the front should complement each other. We should use all our material resources, manpower, and spiritual strength to maintain a long-term war until the final victory. We should unite the conscience of our 450 million compatriots and the heart to revive China and defend East Asia into one heart, and achieve the goal of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>

Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department happened to be in Shanghai to give a lecture on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and was also invited to participate. During the meeting, Director Iwasaki of the press department gave a speech, roughly saying, "At this time, this year is the second year of the Greater East Asia War's decisive stage. I hope that everyone will be responsible for reporting and cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory." Finally, Minister Lin replied on behalf of everyone, roughly saying, "Since China's participation in the war, the responsibilities of our reporters have become even greater. We should do our duty of propaganda, and like the frontline soldiers, be able to live and die with your country to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. We firmly believe that cooperation between China and Japan will become more tight and consolidated in the future." During the meeting, there were mutual blessings and toasts, and the meeting ended happily at 9:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Free Bicycle Owners in Both Concessions to Renew Licenses Starting Today; Strict Enforcement of Licensing Procedures to Prevent Bicycle Theft</h3>
<p>In view of the increase in bicycle theft cases last year, the police of both concessions have recently jointly established new procedures and revised the system for issuing bicycle licenses. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Police Directly Handle Licensing</p>
<p>According to our reporter, the Public Concession has transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Donations Office to the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Department starting today. Simultaneously, the issuance of licenses for the first half of 1943 will officially begin today. All those with bicycles in both concessions should proceed to complete the licensing procedures at the time specified on the right corner of the application form obtained before yesterday.</p>
<p>Bicycle Owners Fulfill Licensing Procedures</p>
<p>When applying for a license in both concessions, applicants must bring their Citizen's ID or Identity Card, ride their bicycle to the vehicle inspection location at the Gordon Road Police Station or 528 Mouhai Road (both in the Public Concession), or 80 Malan Road or 28 Xue Li Road Vehicle Affairs Office (both in the French Concession) for inspection, and submit the completed application form. Then, pay the total licensing fee of 31 yuan.</p>
<p>Rental Bicycles Painted Distinctively</p>
<p>As for bicycles owned by commercial firms and factories, they must present the Citizen's ID of the representative of the firm or factory when submitting the vehicle for inspection. Furthermore, to facilitate identification, all rental bicycles will be painted with a specific color scheme: red in the front and black in the back, to help the police crack bicycle theft cases.</p>
<h3>Oil Rationing System by Headcount Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>Retail edible oil stores in both concessions have ceased selling oil for more than half a month. Residents are worried about the lack of oil for cooking. According to our reporter's inquiry with the oil authorities, although wholesale distributors have drafted a plan for rationing oil by headcount, it will not be implemented in the near future. Previous reports stating that it would be implemented within this week are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Weekly Lecture Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture, which was suspended last week due to the Lunar New Year, continued yesterday. Dharma Master Dengxia lectured on "Methods of Studying Buddhism in Lay Life," emphasizing that study should begin with cultivating blessings, wisdom, and taking refuge in the Three Jewels and observing the Five Precepts to benefit from Buddhist practice. Prominent figures will continue to lecture in future sessions.</p>
<h3>Ration Rice for the 26th Period: Only Three Days Remaining for Distribution; 27th Period Ration Distribution to Begin on the 19th</h3>
<p>The distribution of the 26th period ration rice, managed by authorities in both concessions, which began on the 9th of this month, is now in its seventh day. It is reported that the distribution at rice shops has been smooth in recent days. Taxpaying Chinese residents are using their 26th period rice purchase coupons to collect rice at designated rice shops. Residents should note that only three days remain for this period's distribution. Those with coupons must purchase their rice within these three days, or they will be deemed to have forfeited their ration. As for the 27th period ration rice, rice shops have been receiving goods from designated warehouses since yesterday, based on the orders. Distribution will begin on the 19th of this month at the retail counters of the rice shops. Residents will be supplied upon presentation of the 27th period rice purchase coupons with (1) 1.5 Sheng of white rice, (2) 0.5 Sheng of broken rice, and (3) 1.12 Jin of flour, all sold together for 8.85 yuan in new legal tender. The authorities are scheduled to formally announce this tomorrow to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Encouragement to Students Receiving Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>In this era of turmoil and economic hardship, families who were once self-sufficient are now displaced and struggling due to the war. The rising cost of living makes it difficult even to make ends meet, let alone provide for their children's education. Many young people of school age are unable to pursue their education due to limited resources, and their potential is buried as a result. Today's youth are the backbone of the future society, and their contributions to society depend on the education they receive. The neglect of youth is a small matter, but the loss to society is a great one. As servants of society, we cannot stand idly by and allow young people to waste their time without providing them with opportunities for advancement, causing immense loss to society.</p>
<p>Readers of this newspaper, aware of this situation, launched a scholarship program in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), awarding scholarships to outstanding students from poor families with good character, based on examinations or assessments. These scholarships are funded by voluntary donations from numerous readers, some of whom donate anonymously in large sums, while others economize on food and clothing or laborers saving from their hard-earned wages, or children saving their New Year's money or candy expenses. These small contributions are pooled together to make this possible. The source is hard-won and represents the goodwill of many people, meeting the expectations of many. It is more significant than other individual or group student loans or scholarships, and those who receive it are more honored. Since its implementation, recipient students have understood the purpose of the program and worked hard, creating a group of students and industrial and commercial workers, numbering over 5,000. These students, originally from poor backgrounds, have become even more diligent, developing a village of moral and academic excellence, ready to serve the country. The method is good, and the intention is admirable. It is very suitable and meets the actual needs of this difficult time.</p>
<p>However, the recipient students should thoroughly reflect on how to work hard to live up to people's expectations and not waste their own futures. They should believe in themselves and always be proud of receiving assistance, knowing that it is not easy to obtain. They should be more vigilant and pay attention to their academics, character, willpower, and mental strength, moving towards a brighter future, opening up their paths through hardship, and seeking progress through struggle. In ancient times, people stole light from the wall and read by the glow of fireflies, eventually becoming great sages. All of this came from hardship and self-reliance. Today's students receive external assistance and are more fortunate than those of ancient times. Moreover, they have the earnest expectations and sincere support of many people, which is incomparable to the self-motivation of the ancients. The students should ask themselves how grateful and motivated they should be to live up to the expectations of themselves and others. Students in school should recognize that their study of applied social sciences and natural sciences is still mostly theoretical. Industrial and commercial workers, due to their work, have somewhat approached reality, but they should all broaden their horizons, take society as their current government, and nature as their research object. The ancients said that everything from carriages to horses and even the soles of one's feet is knowledge, and even those who sell soup or slaughter dogs can be heroes. I hope the students will truly understand this, seek fundamental knowledge with a deep vision, and cultivate their working skills with a reasonable life. They should strive to enrich their lives in every way, without relying on others, without borrowing, without being arrogant, and without being lazy, always applying what they have learned and integrating their lives with the times, making further progress. Make further recognition, further practice, constantly doubting, constantly reforming, constantly applying, constantly seeking to know the reason for it, follow the path of natural development, and strive to move forward, thereby approaching things, approaching the world, paying equal attention to hands and brains, and uniting knowledge and action, invigorating the common spirit, and enriching their ambition. By grasping reality and creating the future in this way, we will see that in the future society, scholars will not necessarily come from universities, and entrepreneurs may be more numerous than today. The contribution of scholarships will be even more immeasurable.</p>
<p>After the students complete their studies, they should remember the source of their success. They should seek welfare for society, and often return a hundred or a thousand times what they received today, returning to the source, not falling into emptiness. Although they do not repay individuals with a spring, they will realize the great use of gong in society, which I think is also what the helping gentlemen want to hear.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the approved quota by this newspaper, there have been several instances each day of people standing and crying in front of the hall, sending letters to directly state their predicament, and requesting re-examinations. In the end, there was not enough to go around, and we were powerless to help. At this time, while the recipient students are gleefully receiving and paying their fees, I sincerely hope that the students, in their satisfaction, will reflect on themselves, not be proud or complacent, and not let down the good intentions of the scholarship. Time flies, and time passes like water. I hope the students will work hard in time.</p>

<h3>Meat Industry Association Petitions for Improvement in Distribution System; Meat Prices Again Exceed Price Limits Recently; Authorities Promise to Actively Consider</h3>
<p>Recently, fresh meat prices in the city have again exceeded the price limits, causing hardship for citizens. Our reporter made a special visit to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association to inquire about the black market prices. The person in charge of the association revealed:</p>
<p>Caused by Black Market Manipulation</p>
<p>Since its reorganization in November of last year, the association has been determined to improve its work, and progress has been made. As for the creation of the fresh meat black market, it is actually due to the manipulation and unfair distribution by brokers. Since its reorganization, the association has made eliminating the black market its sole task and has repeatedly submitted opinions to the Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Livestock Market, seeking ways to improve the situation. After multiple consultations, opinions are gradually converging, recognizing that the fundamental solution to eliminating the black market is to transfer the distribution rights to the Industry Bureau, the Shanghai Livestock Market, and the association. One aspect is to dredge sources. The following is an excerpt of the key points regarding distribution that the association submitted to the Industry Bureau's association section on the 30th of last month:</p>
<p>Improve Distribution Methods</p>
<p>(1) Pigs must be distributed fairly and not manipulated by brokers. The Industry Bureau, the Shanghai Livestock Market, and the association will be jointly responsible. Members of the association will be divided into seven districts, and the distribution ratio will be determined by the size of the district. Within each district, members will be divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D, based on their usual business conditions. The Industry Bureau will review and issue distribution certificates for categories A, B, C, and D, allowing them to obtain the appropriate number of pigs from their respective districts. (2) Strictly implement the new distribution system and stipulate that members' profits should not exceed 20% of the Shanghai Livestock Market price. If the number of pigs on the market is small, the opening of sales should be suspended and postponed to the next day or several days later to prevent brokers and members from creating a black market under various pretexts. To strengthen its organization, the association will establish district chiefs in each district and form small groups of 20 members with a group leader. It will also organize an investigation team to investigate members' black market prices and illegal activities at any time. If any of the above situations are found, their distribution rights will be suspended. In serious cases, the distribution rights of a group or even a district will be suspended. The authorities have promised to actively consider the above measures.</p>
<p>Authorities Prepare Investigation Tables</p>
<p>The Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Livestock Market, in order to thoroughly understand the situation of the fresh meat industry in the city, recently issued an investigation form, handing it over to the association for investigation, and set a deadline for completion on the 18th of this month, in preparation for implementing the new distribution system. The person in charge of the fresh meat industry is also scheduled to visit Sheng Yudu, co-manager of the Industry Bureau, tomorrow to request instructions on the implementation of the new distribution methods.</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Cartoon Exhibition Extended for One Day</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia Cartoon Exhibition on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store has been drawing exceptionally large crowds due to its exquisite layout, rich content, and free admission. It was originally scheduled to close yesterday afternoon. However, due to repeated requests from various sectors for an extension of the exhibition date, the China Cartoon Association, the organizer of the exhibition, has decided to extend the exhibition for one day today to meet the needs of the audience and to show support for today's mass demonstration in support of the war effort.</p>
<h3>After the End of the Anti-Spitting Campaign, Expand the Scope of Sanitation Work; Health Department Decides to Improve Public Health Facilities</h3>
<p>The Public Concession in this port has officially begun the second Anti-Spitting Campaign starting yesterday. However, due to rain, various official publicity efforts could not be carried out smoothly. However, according to inquiries, the inspectors dispatched by the Health Department yesterday still carried out investigations in various public places despite the rain. Once detected, they will cooperate with the police to detain the offender to the police station and fine them five yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, after the successful conclusion of the Anti-Spitting Campaign, the Health Department will formulate measures to expand public health publicity work. Improvements will be made to public restrooms and garbage bins in alleyways. Public places will be required to open more windows and clean them regularly. The Health Department will also utilize the baojia system (neighborhood self-governance system) to implement mutual supervision methods to promote the efficiency of public health implementation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Plans to Eliminate "Hostile" Music</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, in order to take consistent action with Japan, will soon announce specific measures to eliminate "hostile" music on the Chinese mainland. In addition, according to Mr. Tao Yi, the Japanese manager of the Victor Record Company's Xujiahui factory, after the army took over and handed over to its management, all anti-Japanese records were destroyed. The factory is now producing suitable records. Since November of last year, an average of 20,000 records have been shipped south each month, and even the needs of Japan are being met, because record factories in Japan have been converted into other more important factories.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Bank Continues to Offer Small Loans to Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Fuxing Bank, previously in view of the large amount of floating capital in the city, believing that if it is not properly channeled into productive enterprises, speculative undertows will eventually be difficult to completely contain. Moreover, the city's credit is tight, and legitimate capital needs of industry and commerce are difficult to raise. Therefore, the bank, based on the policy of supporting industry and commerce and developing production, carefully formulated a plan and gradually implemented it. Among them, small industrial and commercial loans were first tested in August of last year. All industrial and commercial businesses in the port with a capital of more than 5,000 yuan, operating for more than one year, and with good credit can apply for a loan from the bank. All procedures are handled by the Savings and Credit Department. Zhang Yanjun, the manager of the Savings and Credit Department, is responsible for reviewing the use of funds and approving the loan amount. Last year, a very large amount of funds was loaned out, and all loans were repaid on time at the end of the year, with excellent results. This shows that China's credit business needs to be expanded urgently. Now that the Spring Festival is over and lending has begun, in addition to continuing to handle small loans, the bank is also adding small secured loans to industry and commerce. Factories and firms in need of funds can apply for secured loans using valuable movable and immovable property, with terms ranging from three to six months. Interest rates are low and procedures are simple. It will begin handling loans in the middle of this month. Applicants who wish to read the articles of association often negotiate in person at the bank to be cautious.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Offer Industrial Loans to Support Production and Trade Development</h3>
<p>In order to support production and develop trade, the banks and money shops will provide as much lending as possible to various industries that legitimately need to finance their operations, in order to increase production and supply the market. According to inquiries with the banking industry yesterday, the lending to various industries by banks and money shops is divided into (1) loans secured by movable and immovable property for industrial use, (2) loans secured by goods in the respective industry, (3) loans for commercial and industrial firms, agricultural loans, (4) underwriting of goods under export, (5) discounting or accepting commercial bills, and (6) investment in the development of industrial and commercial industries. However, the review aspect is extremely cautious. For example, for mortgage loans, it must be proved that the owner's purpose is not to hoard goods for profit, so as not to help speculation.</p>
<h3>Local Post Office Plans to Resume Remittances to Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, in order to facilitate public remittances, plans to resume remittances to the commercially prosperous areas of eastern Zhejiang. A total of 18 locations are under consideration and are expected to be decided within a few days so that the local branches of the bureau can start remitting. The locations under consideration are as follows: Shaoxing, Zhenhai, Chaqiao, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, Wufu, Sunduan, Shixi, Zhouxiang, Hushan, Cixi, Baiguan, Keqiao, Zhuangqiao, Andong City, Camel Bridge, Xiaqiao Bridge, Huizheng Bridge.</p>

<h3>Northwest Historical Geography Exploration</h3>
<p>— Xie Pengcheng</p>
<p>Records from the "Northwest History and Geography Exploration Geography Group"</p>
<p>Qaka Basin</p>
<p>This area is bordered by the Zahas Mountains to the east, the Dulan mounds to the west, Wuqianshan to the south, and Wanyantongbu to the north, forming a narrow and long basin trending northeast to southwest. The Zahas Mountains are entirely composed of Jurassic strata, which are in fault contact with Paleozoic strata to the north. Towards the Qaka Basin, it gradually descends, likely a geosynclinal structure. The surrounding mountains of the basin are mostly composed of red granite, intruding into older rock layers. However, in the Zahas West Gully, it is seen intruding into Jurassic strata, indicating that its intrusion period could not be earlier than the Jurassic period, and may even be a product of the Tertiary period.</p>
<p>Alluvial fans at the foot of the mountains are the most important component, with fine sand and kaolin being particularly abundant. The central part of the basin is the famous Qinghai salt lake, about forty kilometers long from east to west and ten kilometers wide from north to south. The salt is completely crystalline and appears silvery from a distance, like ice and snow. The salt layer can be divided into four layers from top to bottom: First, the salt cap, consisting of white alkaline salt crystals, about eight or nine centimeters thick; second, crushed salt, white in color, with small, pure salt cubic crystals, about sixty to eighty centimeters to two meters thick; third, large salt or blue salt, with larger crystals, containing black mud and a slightly blue color, about one meter to several meters thick, which is the main salt layer currently extracted; fourth, black mud, with an odor, currently covering an area of approximately four hundred square kilometers. Even if only one meter thick, its reserves are astonishingly rich, making it a major mineral deposit in the Northwest. Since the salt lake has been directly managed by the "Ministry of Finance," it is stipulated that 400,000 dan be transported out annually. However, due to transportation difficulties, only horse-drawn carts, cattle, and camels are used as transportation tools, and even with full effort, only 70,000 to 80,000 dan can be transported out annually to supply the food needs of Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. The formation of the salt is due to the surrounding mountains being mostly granite, which undergoes chemical reactions after weathering and decomposition. Furthermore, due to the dry climate and strong evaporation, this massive amount of salt has accumulated. According to local residents, salt caverns that have been mined are soon filled again, indicating the high concentration of salt in the water. If the source of the salt is from the weathering and decomposition of the surrounding mountain rocks, it is truly an inexhaustible mineral resource. There is now a highway from Lanzhou to Qaka, and the terrain is flat, making the construction of a light railway easy.</p>
<p>The topography of this basin is roughly the same as the Qinghai Basin. However, in the eastern part of the basin, the hills, about one hundred and fifty meters high, between the Zahas West Gully and Nadang Valley mouths, are purely composed of large and small gravel, which are terminal moraines from the Quaternary glaciation. The U-shaped valleys and cirques in the Zahas West Gully are particularly well-preserved. The alluvial terraces at the foot of the Wanyantongbu Mountains can be divided into about four layers, with the higher ones being about one hundred and twenty to thirty meters high and the lower ones being several to ten meters high. The stream valleys are constantly cutting down, creating an imbalance between the riverbed and the basin level. This can also explain why the basin is still continuing to subside. Furthermore, the dry climate of this basin also affects the plant communities. To the west of the Zahas Mountains, although there is a vast and boundless hygrophytic grassland, the degree of dryness gradually increases further west, with *Reaumuria*, *Achnatherum splendens*, *Nitraria tangutorum*, and *Ephedra* being commonly seen. The climate changes are even more pronounced near Qaka, with many succulent Chenopodiaceae and several halophytic plants. Other famous medicinal plants of the Northwest, such as *Cistanche deserticola*, also grow here, rising about four or five inches from the ground, with purple-red club-shaped flowers when blooming. The salt lake is shallow and not like the vast Qinghai Lake, which can regulate the surrounding climate. The surrounding high mountains have more rainfall and are sometimes covered in white snow, resulting in abundant water and grass. Yurts and tents are mostly distributed in the deep mountains and remote valleys. The evaporation rate in the basin is significant, and rain and snow rarely reach the ground. Many of the cattle and sheep raised by the salt miners in Qaka die due to drought. Qaka is located to the north of the salt lake, with more than a dozen yurts nearby, all living by salt mining, with animal husbandry being only a sideline. About thirty li west of Qaka is a place called Mohu, with more than a dozen earthen houses and a row of cave dwellings, inhabited by both Han and Hui people, mostly migrated from Huangyuan, Xining, and Huzhu counties. Mountain springs emerge in the area, providing irrigation, so residents mostly grow highland barley, fruits, and oats. The soil is good, and with a little fertilizer, it becomes fertile land. However, the water volume is limited, and the increase in cultivated land area is not unlimited.</p>
<p>Dulan Basin</p>
<p>This basin is bordered by Rongrong Haorao (mountain name) and Xueli Daowa to the north, and Qianshanxiu to the south, all about six hundred meters higher than Dulan, forming a narrow and long basin trending northwest to southeast. To the east is Dulan Lake, and to the west is the Dulan Salt Lake. In terms of geological structure, Kehaorao and Xueli Daowa are composed of Paleozoic rock layers and Tertiary granite, the entire mass thrusting southwest, covering the Middle or Late Tertiary rock layers. The latter rock layers are regularly positioned, lying prone downwards, forming hills at the foot of the mountains. The fault lines are significantly more prominent than those in the Qinghai and Qaka basins. Rigangdawa on the south bank of the basin is a composite of Paleozoic metamorphic rocks and Tertiary granite. The entire mass thrusts southwest, covering the northern edge of the Dalüdügan Basin (detailed later) from the Upper Cretaceous and Late Tertiary strata. Therefore, the southwestern edge of this basin is a normal fault. Based on this, the structure of this basin is also a geosyncline. Dulan County is located on the northern edge of this basin, with an altitude of about three thousand eight hundred meters. There are many sand dunes at the foot of the northeast mountains, so this basin has many southwest winds. This can also be used to prove it.</p>
<p>The alluvial deposits at the foot of Rongrong Haorao gently slope towards the basin, with rounded and elongated isolated masses scattered on them, about one hundred meters high, resembling remnants of alluvial layers. In fact, they are remnants of lateral moraines, terminal moraines, and medial moraines. The same topography exists in the Xueli Daowa Valley. The U-shaped valley from the Dulan Pass to Shangqianba is about twenty kilometers long, with cirques on both sides of the mountains. This proves that during the Quaternary period, glaciers flowed west from the Dulan Pass, converging with the ice flows from the Rongrong Haorao and Xueli Daowa mountains and flowing south into this basin. The extensive and thick alluvial deposits at the foot of Rongrong Haorao and other mountains could not have been caused by water flow but are accumulations after glacial melt. The salt quality of the Dulan Salt Lake is roughly the same as that of Qaka. No one has mined it yet. The area is quite large, and the reserves must be substantial. The source of the salt is also likely due to the weathering and decomposition of the surrounding granite. The nearby flora is also no different from Qaka.</p>
<p>The area near Dulan can be called a semi-agricultural region. In addition to planting Qingke, wheat, rapeseed, and vegetables in places where water can be diverted for irrigation, the rest has the characteristics of a dry grassland.</p>
<p>Between Dulan Temple and Dulan, there is a place called Chahan River, which is a scenic area near Dulan. The distribution of plants there can be representative of the high mountains within a hundred li around Dulan. On the mountains, at an altitude of four thousand meters, sparse cypress trees grow. The layer below it (below four thousand meters) is no different from the area near Dulan. The cypress forest extends from four thousand meters to four thousand two hundred meters. The sunny side is a cypress forest, while the shady side is a mixed forest of cypress and spruce, or a pure spruce forest. At four thousand one hundred meters, there are mountain willows growing under the forest. Above four thousand two hundred meters, forests disappear, and mountain willows still lie prostrate on the ground, emerging only after about ten meters. Further up to the mountaintop, there are still two or three hundred meters. Although there is no permanent snow in this zone, rainfall below four thousand two hundred meters turns to snow in this zone, resulting in few plants. The grass under the forest trees is roughly the same as in Zahas, but without *Thermopsis lanceolata*. However, *Rheum alexandrae*, broad-leaved mountain leeks, and purple fragrant *Lavandula angustifolia* are not found in Zahas. The geographical characteristics of the Dulan Basin are also similar to Qaka, but the aforementioned northeast mountains are high and steep, with abundant rain and snow. The water flows converge into the Dulan River, which flows into the basin, with a large volume of water, creating good agricultural land in Dulan, attracting Han Chinese farmers and Salar people to cultivate, residing in three villages to the north, east, and west, totaling more than one hundred and thirty households. Han Chinese are the majority, followed by Hui people. Dulan has a vast area and a sparse population, so agriculture is extensive, and crop rotation is adopted. The Hui and Han are skilled in farming, and the types of crops they plant are more diverse. Although affected by changes in the weather, they are not completely hopeless. The local farmers only grow highland barley, and their harvests are often uncertain. The total harvest from all the cultivated land near Dulan is about seven hundred dan annually, enough to supply local consumption. However, nomadic Mongolians often come to purchase Qingke, so the local food supply is sometimes scarce and must be supplemented by transportation from Huangyuan. Most of the land in the basin is saline-alkali soil, which is not conducive to crop production. Only in places with a large amount of freshwater flushing can cultivation be carried out. Agricultural areas in the dry grassland, such as Xiarhariha, Zhaha Wusu, and Zhazha Xiaoka, are all like this, so the development of cultivated land is greatly limited by the natural environment. Furthermore, agriculture in this area depends entirely on irrigation, and the water supplied by the rivers is not inexhaustible, so a large-scale migration of farmers is unlikely. Dry basins are mostly suitable for animal husbandry. Yurts are commonly seen scattered in the valleys with abundant water and grass, and nomadic tribes are distributed in the north and south of the Dulan Basin. Today, the power of the Mongolians is declining, grazing land is shrinking, and the vast Qaidam region in the west is being ravaged and occupied by the Kazakhs, forcing them to migrate eastward, further narrowing their living space.</p>
<p>Dalüdügan Basin</p>
<p>This basin is located south of the Dulan Basin, separated by the Rigangdawa Mountains. Arveyran stands to the south, with the former thrusting south and the latter covering northward. The Late Tertiary strata lie prone beneath it. Therefore, the north and south of this basin are also bordered by faults. The prominence of the fault outcrop of Rigangdawa, composed of Paleozoic green schist and sandstone, can be seen in Dangjinggaier (gully name). About three kilometers east, green schist lies flat on the Late Tertiary strata, like an umbrella. The latter is composed of conglomerate, breccia, sandstone, loess, etc. The lithology is loose, seeming younger than the Red Rock Series in the Dulan Basin, and the composition is mainly rock debris from the surrounding mountains, such as green schist, granite, and Cretaceous gravelly sandstone. An unconformity lies on the Cretaceous strata, dipping south or southeast at about fifty to eighty degrees. In the central part of the basin, it decreases to about ten degrees. In the Fourth Basin, lateral moraines, medial moraines, and terminal moraines are particularly well-preserved. Judging from the current topography, during the Quaternary period, there were large glaciers in this area, which can be divided into two major flows: one flowing north from the eastern part of Arveyran, entering the Dulan Basin along the Guo (gully name), and the other flowing southwest from the western part of Arveyran, converging the snow and ice in the central and northern mountains and entering the Dalüdügan Basin. The medial moraine between the two major glaciers of the day is still standing tall south of Dangjinggaier. Dangjinggaier is a narrow canyon, with very thin alluvial deposits. Compared with Guo, it is a relatively newly cut river valley. As for the glacial melt deposits in this basin, the accumulation is extensive and cannot be compared with the aforementioned basins. At the northwest foot of Arveyran, the area of sand dune distribution is very large, resembling a desert region. Only a few types of plants grow there, such as *Reaumuria*, *Nitraria tangutorum*, *Lycium ruthenicum*, and *Achnatherum splendens*.</p>
<p>The results of the exploration from Lanzhou to Dulan can be summarized as follows: In terms of geology, strata from the Archean Nanshan System, Carboniferous-Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous are distributed along the way, while Tertiary and Quaternary strata occupy a larger area. In terms of igneous rocks, granite is dominant, and most are products of the Tertiary period. The second is diabase and other intrusive rock veins, which intrude into older strata. As for the orogenic periods, in addition to the unconformable contacts between the Carboniferous-Permian and the Nanshan System, the Triassic and the Carboniferous-Permian, the Upper or Middle Tertiary and various older rock layers seen on the Gansu-Qinghai road, the unconformity between the Late Tertiary sediments (Riyue Mountain Series) and various older rock layers and Quaternary alluvial layers is particularly prominent and widespread. The recent and most important orogenic movement in Gansu and Qinghai was likely in the Late Tertiary or Early Quaternary. The main features of today's topography were formed by this movement. The trend of the basins and mountains is roughly northwest-southeast, and the boundary between the two is mostly the location of faults. The direction of movement is approximately from northeast to southwest, so the Qinghai Qaka, Dulan, and Dalüdügan basins are all in the form of geosynclines. This movement seems to be continuing, so the alluvial deposits at the foot of the mountains are increasing daily, and the stream valleys are cutting down more frequently. This may be a sign that the basins are still subsiding. As for the rich reserves of the Qaka and Dulan salt lakes, they are worth paying attention to. The granite of the surrounding mountains is the source of salt. The well-preserved glacial landforms of the Quaternary period, in addition to those seen in the Qinling Mountains, which are the same as in the Daba Mountains, and the U-shaped valleys, lateral moraines, main moraines, terminal moraines, and cirques seen from the southern shore of Qinghai Lake to near Dulan, are particularly well-preserved, which can prove that glaciers in the Quaternary period were distributed in the area of Gansu and Qinghai at an altitude of about four thousand meters. The extensive and thick accumulations formed after glacial melt are the characteristics of the Qaka, Dulan, and Dalüdügan basins. In terms of plants, most of the area from near Lanzhou to Dulan has the characteristics of a dry grassland, which is a continuation of the western Xinjiang and Mongolian regions. However, in places with abundant rainwater or groundwater, hygrophytic grasslands or tundra bogs are formed. The Hasi and Chahan River areas are representative of the distribution of high mountain plants east of Dulan. *Juniperus przewalskii* forests, which are tropical, are a common phenomenon on various high mountains within several hundred li around Dulan.

<h3>The Coal Market Control Agency Decides to Strictly Enforce Management Regulations. Anyone Daring to Defy Orders Will Be Strictly Investigated. Cash Allocation is Expected to Gradually Increase.</h3>
<p>Regarding the supply of bulk fuel in this city, after the relevant authorities actively adopted effective measures and strictly controlled and implemented the rationing system, the general situation has improved. However, some coal merchants, with ulterior motives, engaged in black market transactions and spread rumors, attempting to hoard goods for profit. The authorities discovered and dealt with the case. The control agency regrets this. In order to uphold the original intention and completely eliminate illegal transactions, in addition to the Dazhong United Coal Company forwarding letters to various coal merchants' trade associations to closely cooperate and supervise their members, it has also decided to strictly enforce various established regulations. Anyone who violates or fails to comply with the regulations, or intends to engage in unauthorized trading, will be stopped from allocating any kind of cash coal and will be severely punished as a warning to others. Yesterday, a reporter who is familiar with the coal market said that the fuel reserves in this city are not only exceptionally abundant, but also the source of supply is continuous. Most of this coal comes from North China and Korea, with very low production costs. At the same time, cash allocation has never been interrupted, so there is no shortage. It is also learned that the eighth batch of goods will be allocated within days, but the selling price per ton has not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>The City Police Department Sends Personnel to Participate in the Economic Special High Police Class.</h3>
<p>The Central Police Academy, in order to actively train economic special high-level personnel, has specially continued to hold the fourth term of the Economic Special High Police Training Class to cultivate economic special high police. The Municipal Police Department has specially designated a large number of inspectors to go to the school for training, in order to complete and strengthen the city's police force as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Selling Household Rice and Noodle Ration Coupons Leads to Arrest and Sentencing. Li Huijin is Sentenced to One Year and Six Months.</h3>
<p>Li Huijin, a Cantonese landlord at No. 789 Haining Road, recently came up with a whimsical idea. After receiving the household rice and flour coupons issued by the Public Works Department, he sold them to peddlers and fellow villagers Huang Jirong and Nanjing resident Zhang Peiming at a high price. The case was discovered by the local Jia head, who reported it to the Huishi police station. Detectives were sent to arrest Li at his address and brought him and his wife, Ms. Mei, to the police station. They confessed that they had resold the rice and noodle coupons to Huang and Zhang for profit. The detectives also arrested Huang and Zhang one after another. There were as many as two hundred and fifty-six of these rice and noodle coupons. They were sent to the First Special Court, stating that they should be detained for detailed investigation. After verifying that the above numbers matched, the case was reviewed by Judge Lu in the Third Criminal Court yesterday. The lawyer representing the Legal Department of the Public Works Department filed a lawsuit based on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, stating that the household rice was intended to help civilians make a living and was priced cheaply. It was wrong to resell the low-priced rice and flour to others at a high price for double the profit. He even embezzled the rice and noodle coupons, which were the food for his three tenants to barely survive on congee and noodles every ten days. It was a heinous crime. He requested severe punishment to warn the landlords of each household not to follow suit and take advantage of this unjustified black profit. As a result, after interrogation and judgment, Li Huijin was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, Huang Jirong was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for assisting in the embezzlement, and Zhang Peiming was fined one hundred yuan. Li Mei was acquitted and released.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Lawyers Association is Established.</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China, located in the capital, aims to research and investigate domestic and foreign laws, promote the judiciary, and unite the spirit of the legal community to jointly seek welfare. Since its establishment, it has made many contributions to the progress of the rule of law in our country. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the Lawyers Association, after being actively organized by Xu Weizhen, president of the Second Branch of the High Court, has now been formally established. All personnel of the courts at all levels in this city have participated.</p>
<h3>The Police Department Issues an Arrest Warrant for Hua Weiyuan.</h3>
<p>Hua Weiyuan, director of the Accounting Office of the Shanghai West Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau, embezzled public funds, which could not be compensated. After the case was discovered, he fled without a trace. The Finance Bureau has reported the situation to the Municipal Government. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Police Department to immediately order all its branches to cooperate in the arrest, ensuring that he is brought to justice and severely punished.</p>

<h3>Three Hundred Years of South Seas Storms</h3>
<p>— Elector</p>
<p>The South Seas, the overseas homeland of the Chinese nation, is facing a new era due to the general retreat of Anglo-American imperialist forces. This is the time for the original inhabitants of the South Seas to start using their own strength to determine their own destiny! Especially our Chinese nation, due to its particularly close historical relationship with various parts of the South Seas, and the existence of the vast overseas Chinese with their political, cultural, and especially economic potential in various parts of the South Seas, cannot but pay special attention to its current situation and its future.</p>
<p>For three hundred years, the South Seas has become a paradise for pirates, and a colonial operation site for countries such as the Netherlands, England, and the United States! It has become a treasure trove for capitalist vampires, and at the same time, a hell on earth where local indigenous people and Chinese compatriots are oppressed and exploited!</p>
<p>The South Seas archipelago, or what Westerners call Indonesia, is composed of thousands of islands with a total area of more than two million square kilometers, located in a double arc between Asia and Australia. Before the end of the 18th century, its population did not exceed three million. The numerous races and ethnic groups on the islands were at different levels of social and economic development, speaking various languages and dialects.</p>
<p>Due to the advantageous terrain of the archipelago's location on the sea route between China and India, the ancient lands of culture, the indigenous peoples have long been influenced by China and India. Several areas of Java and Sumatra are surrounding the most developed countries in the Indian Ocean basin.</p>
<p>Indian and Chinese "military expeditions" repeatedly conquered and occupied individual areas of the islands. The Malays living along the coasts of the islands were formed by the mixture of local indigenous residents and "newcomers" from overseas expeditions. The Malays and Javanese stand side by side at the highest stage of development among the various ethnic groups in the archipelago, and their languages ​​form the most common language in the coastal areas of the archipelago.</p>
<p>The residents along the archipelago coast have long used their own unique ditch-digging methods to dig through the inland seas of the archipelago, completing transportation between individual islands. They also ventured on longer journeys, reaching India, Madagascar, and Africa. Chinese and Indian merchants also traded with the archipelago very early, purchasing various spices.</p>
<p>In the 13th to 15th centuries, during the Yuan and Ming dynasties of China, as a result of the Indian conquest, a grand Indian-Javanese feudal state was established in Java, several of which were very powerful and received tribute from many small ethnic groups on the islands. At the same time, China and India introduced irrigation systems, and agriculture began to develop on the islands. Javanese script, originating from India, began to appear, and the people of Java, Sumatra, and Bali also inherited religion, Hinduism, and part of Buddhism from the Indian conquerors, which occupied a dominant position in the most developed areas of the archipelago before the 15th century.</p>
<p>By the eve of the 18th century, Islam began to seize the positions of Hinduism and Buddhism on the islands, becoming the dominant religion in most parts of the Indonesian archipelago. However, in some areas, various religions coexisted and developed.</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the many powerful feudal states established by India in the archipelago declined, giving way to Islamic principalities. However, soon, the Dutch launched a colonial rule that lasted for two centuries, destroying the power of these principalities. The Netherlands East India Company monopolized all trade, cut them off from external markets, and deprived them of past income. They used various treaties to coerce the Javanese kings and feudal lords to provide local products.</p>
<p>Java, the most developed region of feudalism in the archipelago, where the kings had unlimited authority, just like in China, practicing the system of "all land under heaven belongs to the king, and all people within the borders are the king's subjects." Farmers had to pay not only land rent but also perform heavy labor.</p>
<p>The Dutch invasion strengthened feudal oppression, and peasant uprisings against local feudal lords and company spokespersons followed one after another, and various principalities (native states) also continuously fought against the company's plunder policies. The blood of this battle stained the entire South Seas history of the 18th century. The war from 1750 to 1763 was particularly heroic. However, the Dutch East India Company finally took advantage of the divisions between the principalities and the internal strife among local authorities to suppress the national resistance and expand its own territory. By the end of the 18th century, the Netherlands East India Company had seized most of the Javanese territory and began to exploit the natives. Later, in addition to Java and the small island of Madura, the Dutch called all the islands of Indonesia that had not yet been conquered "outer territories."</p>
<p>The "outer territories" retained many different social structural components before the end of the 18th century. In Borneo, Celebes, and other isolated inland areas of the archipelago, national systems were still retained. Among the most backward natives of New Guinea, the practice of cannibalism was still retained. The East India Company implemented a policy of plunder in the "outer territories."</p>
<p>However, since the withdrawal from the War of the Spanish Succession, the Netherlands has become a secondary colonial power. The hegemony in the East had to be given to England, whose economic development surpassed that of the Netherlands. The East India Company could no longer prevent the British from invading Indonesia. The British consolidated their position on the west coast of Sumatra, invaded Borneo, and attempted to take advantage of the difficulties of the war between the Dutch and the natives. As a result, the Netherlands East India's monopoly was broken. The Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784) dealt the company the final blow. Its stronghold on the east coast of India fell into the hands of the British, and the Dutch territory on the west coast of Sumatra was surrendered to the British by the company's officials without a fight.</p>
<p>The 19th century was the era when Britain first contended for hegemony in the South Seas, followed by the United States.</p>
<p>In 1811, a British fleet of one hundred warships appeared near Batavia, and the Governor-General of India personally commanded the expedition. 12,000 marines occupied the colonial capital almost without resistance. The Dutch army retreated and scattered into the interior. When the British warships appeared near Semarang, Indonesian soldiers revolted, killing the Dutch officers, and the era of British rule in Indonesia began.</p>
<p>Britain made major changes in the methods of exploitation in Indonesia. In 1813, the abolition of the Sultanate and the annexation of its territory were implemented, with the Sultan relying on British subsidies to live. In the territory of the archipelago directly governed by the British, the power of the native chiefs was deprived, and the British also seized judicial and tax collection rights. The entire Java was divided into sixteen administrative regions, ruled by European officials appointed by the British. Solo and Yogyakarta, although retained as vassal principalities, completely lost their autonomy, just like the native states in India.</p>
<p>New methods of exploitation such as monetary taxes and land taxes appeared in the old modes of exploitation, but the old shackles remained. Handicrafts in Java and other places suffered serious blows, foreign capital began to invade the countryside, and the scope of extraction expanded.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire, the Netherlands regained its independence and recovered its colonies, but did not recover Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, and British Guiana. In the movement to recover the colonies, it fought against Britain again. The people of Java and the vast Chinese compatriots in the South Seas took the opportunity to launch uprisings against the colonial vampires. The uprising from 1825 to 1830 in particular shook the colonial powers. The Dutch could not cope with the "too many" guerrillas, and the Javanese troops of the government army often turned to the side of the insurgents. This bloody battle lasted for five years. Finally, due to the wavering of the feudal lords of the vassal principalities, the Dutch's purchase tactics and deceptive reform policies took effect, and they conquered the uprising areas inch by inch.</p>
<p>After the Dutch suppressed the uprising and consolidated the position of the colonial regime, they implemented even more harsh exploitation, especially the notorious forced cultivation system. All farmers had to cultivate a certain portion of their land with export crops instructed by the government. In the compulsory process, they had to plant sugar cane, Indian indigo coffee trees, tobacco, etc., and hand over all the harvests to the government's warehouses in lieu of monetary taxes. In addition, farmers had to perform various public and private labor services for the government and officials of all sizes. Tens of thousands of farmers were driven to build seaports, castles, and private residences for high and low officials.</p>
<p>The British did not relax their operations in the South Seas archipelago. They established forces in Sumatra and other places, especially the construction of Singapore, establishing a position of great strategic and economic significance on the sea route from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The Netherlands was forced to make concessions to Britain. In order to stop British invasion of Sumatra, the Netherlands had to cede all the remnants of its own territories in India and the Malay Peninsula to Britain, and divide the territories in Southeast Asia equally with Britain.</p>
<p>However, Britain continued to advance aggressively, first establishing bases in North Borneo, in Brunei and Sarawak, placing these two countries under British control. The Dutch continued to resist. In 1851, the conquest of West Borneo began. Ruthless oppression aroused the resistance of Chinese compatriots. Our ancestors bravely resisted the Dutch regular army and the fleet that blockaded all the rivers. In 1854, the important city of Montrado was lost, and overseas Chinese were massacred, but the resistance was not destroyed. The Triads continued to lead compatriots and natives in resistance until 1856, when they were eliminated due to isolation and lack of support. However, uprisings continued to break out in places such as Banjarmasin in West Borneo.</p>
<p>By the mid-19th century, Britain had successively established colonial regimes in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, North Borneo, and Australia, dividing the power and interests in the Southwest Pacific with the Netherlands. However, the emerging United States also gradually advanced its power. By the end of the 19th century, especially with regard to the struggle for the Philippines, as a result of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Philippine Islands, which the Spanish had managed for three hundred years, were completely occupied by the United States.</p>
<p>The entire second half of the 19th century was filled with the bloodshed of the European and American powers' scramble for Eastern, especially South Seas, colonies. The South Seas archipelago, as well as Annam, Burma, and the coastal areas of China, were plunged into a tragic situation of being ravaged and trampled upon. However, in this tragedy and pain, the vast South Seas residents and Chinese compatriots awakened, directly and indirectly struggling for liberation under the banner of "national self-determination." The history of the 19th and one-third of the 20th centuries is a tragic war history of oppressed nations resisting the extravagant desires of European and American imperialism. Especially after December 8, 1941, the forces of European and American imperialism were finally driven out of the South Seas and even the entire Pacific Ocean. The bloody history of more than three hundred years has revealed its final page. What follows will be the history of self-determination of our East Asian nations. How carefully and enthusiastically we must describe the brilliant future history!</p>

<h3>China-West Charity Soccer Game Postponed Again Due to Rain Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China-West Charity Soccer Game, inviting Hualian to compete against the Italian-Portuguese Allied Forces, could not be held due to rain and has been postponed to next weekend (January 11). The game will still take place at the original location.</p>
<h3>Small Soccer Referee Association Established</h3>

<h3>Essay Contest Remarks</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate the readers' great love and support, and at the same time, we feel very sorry and regretful, because we received as many as 812 essays, but only 20 outstanding works were selected in the preliminary round. In this situation, it is naturally inevitable that there will be regrets of missing hidden gems!</p>
<p>Precisely because of this reason, we are quite cautious in the review and evaluation process. Often, an article undergoes multiple rounds of research before a hypothetical score is given, for fear of failing the author's good intentions. However, we are afraid that there will still be omissions, and we can only do our best.</p>
<p>In various different lives, we are given a lot of real feelings. Generally speaking, in this difficult period, only by enduring and not forgetting to struggle can we have a bright future. The life we ​​want to live is still an active life. Only an active life can truly embody the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Among the submissions this time, in terms of age, the oldest was a 75-year-old worker, and the youngest was a 12-year-old primary school student. In terms of occupation, apprentices and students were the most numerous, followed by teachers and clerks, and then laborers. There were also many other miscellaneous categories, such as housewives, maids, doctors, and astrologers. It was truly a grand gathering of talents of all ages. We hereby express our greatest respect.</p>
<p>Some readers asked about the evaluation criteria. We can also report incidentally that the content accounts for 40%, structure accounts for 20%, writing style accounts for 30%, and calligraphy accounts for 10%. This is used to obtain a total score for the entire article. At the same time, the more outstanding entries in each category are extracted as selected outstanding works.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank all the judges for spending a lot of precious time in their busy schedules to carefully review and approve the entries. We hereby express our gratitude. The titles of the selected individuals are listed below:</p>
<p>First Prize: Jin Yiqing</p>
<p>Second Prize: Liu Feiqiong, Si Yiwei</p>
<p>Third Prize: Qu Zhongqing, Yu Huizhen, Fang Chuan</p>

<h3>First Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life—Hospital Attendant (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>"Pay attention to everything and you will learn something." This was the admonition that Principal Wang gave to the 14 classmates who would no longer continue their studies at the junior high school graduation ceremony. He repeatedly comforted us, advising us not to be pessimistic because we dropped out of school due to economic problems. He sincerely explained to us that as long as we work hard, we can obtain valuable knowledge anytime and anywhere without paying any price. He listed many sages who completed their immortal feats in difficult and arduous environments. He encouraged us not to blindly believe the common saying, "Graduation means unemployment." He exhorted us to maintain a promising spirit. He instructed us to work hard in a down-to-earth manner. At the same time, he told us about a job opportunity, that a certain large hospital was recruiting 20 attendants with junior high school education. Finally, he instructed us that maintaining a job is not easier than finding one, and without perseverance, we will never achieve success.</p>
<p>So, I participated in this recruitment exam with great joy and was lucky enough to rank among the top. Since then, I have spent 18 months of regular life with the purpose of working to learn.</p>
<p>When I completed the admission procedures, put on the white uniform, and wore the No. 1 attendant badge on my chest, I waited with 19 companions for the distribution of work. The young administrator spoke kindly and cordially about the work of each department. He said that "attendants," as the name suggests, are dedicated to serving people and undertaking lower-level work for them. However, we must first recognize that all "work" is sacred. "There is no distinction between noble and humble in work, especially for hospital employees. The prerequisite qualifications must include a strong physique, keen senses, a philanthropic concept, sincere behavior, and a passionate embrace. Otherwise, one cannot fulfill their duties."</p>
<p>We work 10 hours a day, study and rest for 6 hours, and sleep for 8 hours. Every morning, we have 20 minutes of fitness exercises. Every week, we can take half a day off in rotation. Every year, we have two weeks of vacation. We receive a living allowance of 25 yuan per month and an average bonus of about 30 yuan. The hospital provides food and lodging, so it is enough to maintain personal living expenses and a savings of 3 yuan per month.</p>
<p>In order to promote the spirit of self-government, our group organized a fellowship association, mutually encouraging the weaknesses of our companions, collectively discussing the satisfaction we have with our work, and reviewing various lessons in a blitz manner. Sometimes, doctors and head nurses attend to guide us on basic common sense in terms of hygiene. Although we are already vocational youth, we still live a school life. We have indeed gained a lot of valuable knowledge without paying any price. This is most worthy of our gratitude for the hospital's generous treatment, because a stable life makes us feel more interested in our work.</p>
<p>We are in contact with patients all day long and are always at risk of being attacked by germs. Therefore, the hospital periodically injects us with vaccines and vaccinates us. We have a physical examination every six months. As a result of the third physical examination, two companions were found to have early-stage lung disease. After two months of recuperation, they recovered their health. Because of this lesson, we further maintain our own health.</p>
<p>Initially, I was assigned to serve in the outpatient clinic. At that time, the weather was very hot. In addition to routine patients, there were an average of four or five patients with epidemic diseases coming to the hospital for emergency treatment every day. I was busy cleaning and disinfecting non-stop. At the same time, there were quite a few patients who had taken poison. According to my diary statistics, there were a total of 27 times in three months, all of whom were women. Among them, 22 were due to family disputes. The most ridiculous time, a woman asked her husband to buy a pair of leather shoes, but failed to achieve her goal and swallowed less than one cc of opium ash. When she was sent to the emergency room, she closed her eyes and said nothing. Her family members were at a loss. After emergency treatment, it cost more than ten yuan in medical expenses, and she left with a smile. This clearly shows the low level of general knowledge and the demise of some social morals. At that time, there was a sigh that was both laughable and regrettable. Later, it became a source of information for after-work conversations.</p>
<h3>The Teacher of All Ages (13)</h3>
<p>— James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>"I certainly sympathize with you," Chips said.</p>
<p>"I hope you will. That is what brought me here to ask you. Briefly, my idea is this—if you feel like it, too, and can put your heart into it—how would it be if you came back to the school for a time? You still look perfectly suitable and, of course, you know the ropes. I don't want you to do a lot of hard work—you needn't strain at anything—just look round and do what you like. What I want of you, more than anything, isn't what actual work you can do—though that will be valuable, of course—it's the way you can help in other ways—just belonging to the school, that's enough. Nobody has ever been more popular than you were—are, even now—if anything threatened to go wrong, you could help to steady things. And there might be something of the sort going on..."</p>
<p>Chips, breathing quickly, and with a sense of warm exultation in his heart, answered, "I'll come..."</p>
<p>(14)</p>
<p>He retained his room at Mrs. Wickett's; indeed, he still lived there; but every morning, about half past ten, he put on his coat and muffler and crossed the road to the school. He found it all very suitable; the actual work was not taxing. There were a few classes in Latin and Roman History—old subjects—even the old pronunciation. The same jokes about certain conjugations—jokes that the new generation had not heard, and which, therefore, gained a success which gratified him. He felt like a music-hall star coming on to the stage for the last time after many encores.</p>
<p>It was wonderful, they all said, how quickly he remembered everyone's names and faces. They did not realize how closely, across the road, he had kept in touch with them.</p>
<p>He was, in a quiet way, a great success. He helped in all sorts of odd ways, that everyone knew and felt. And for the first time in his life he felt necessary—necessary to something, something that was close to his heart. There is no sublimer form of self-satisfaction, and this was finally his. (36)</p>
<h3>A Preview of "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle"</h3>
<p>— Semi-Crazy</p>
<p>The long-awaited "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" finally held a preview yesterday (the 13th). The reporter was invited to get a sneak peek, so I will write down my impressions after watching it.</p>
<p>This is a rather long, narrative documentary. The story centers on Yuoda Yoshiichi, writing about how this loyal young man is inspired by the idea of ​​loyalty to the emperor and serving the country, and is determined to enter the aviation team preparatory training department to realize his dream of becoming a naval aviation soldier. The film depicts the life of the barracks, which is quite moving. We see hundreds of strong men doing gymnastics, swimming, sumo (i.e. wrestling), playing ball, rowing... and in these sports techniques, there is no place that does not contain implicit lessons of perseverance. The most memorable is the scene of rowing. Yuoda's team lost, and the captain asked them: "Do you know the reason for the defeat?" Yuoda replied, "Because the boat is not good." The captain said: "When the real war starts, can you claim that you have not been defeated because the weapons are not good?" In these places, we can clearly see the characteristics of Japanese military training. Their advantages lie in enduring hardship, being able to endure hard work, and absolute obedience, etc.</p>
<p>I think "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" is a documentary that lives up to its name. It goes without saying that the characters are relatively poor. The characteristic of a documentary lies in conveying an idea, a kind of consciousness, to the audience through the director's subjective selection in a concise and straightforward manner using pictures. After watching this film, we all feel the bravery and obedience of Japanese soldiers. If this film is successful, then this is its success.</p>
<h3>Heading Towards the Path of "Self-Reliance"</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>I remember someone saying, "The most pitiful and suffering creatures in the old Chinese family are women." Sisters with practical experience probably have to admit this statement. If I hadn't been born a daughter, no matter how difficult the family was, I would have had equal educational opportunities with my brothers. Unfortunately, I dropped out of school a few years ago because "daughters ultimately belong to someone else" and "why should girls read so many books!" However, the desire for knowledge and survival is an innate instinct, the only right of mankind to society. I want to survive, and I also want to learn. Limited by my inability to be independent, my parents could deprive me of the happiness of going to school during the day, but I believe that in the vast crowd, I will find a place to live and satisfy my desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>Perhaps "where there's a will, there's a way"! Last summer, through a friend's introduction, I finally passed the entrance examination for the Zili (Self-Reliance) Women's Night School at 392 Route MacTaggart. Although I have only studied for one semester, I feel sincerely satisfied. I think there must be many like me in society, so I dare to introduce some information about my alma mater to those who share the same pain.</p>
<p>Shanghai has everything. Hypocrites and professional philanthropists abound. Although I learned about "Zili" through a friend's introduction and knew that the authorities were quite historical educators of the people, I was still cautious and quietly observed their words and deeds. I remember once asking our "unpaid principal" (this term I only learned and confirmed later), "Why doesn't the school post more enrollment advertisements to attract more students?" He replied wonderfully: "Famous doctors with high medical ethics never advertise, and a good school should not rely on advertisements to recruit students." The economic situation of our school makes it impossible for the authorities not to do so, but looking at the facilities of the school for the past six months, none of them are about empty talk but focus on practicality. Sure enough, after the start of school, the classrooms were crowded with students.</p>
<p>Many volunteer night schools fulfill their obligations to students, but principals and teachers do not always fulfill their obligations. Our school is just the opposite. "It is very shameful that all of us are volunteers because we still collect a little miscellaneous fees from the students (a very small amount, ten yuan for junior high school, eight yuan for elementary school, and completely free for the poor - author's note), so we dare not put up the sign of volunteering." I remember the "unpaid principal" said this to us, but isn't this what should be? Our school is based on the principle of self-reliance, with "personality first" as its code of conduct. It is neither funded by private individuals nor under the direction of any institution or organization. Without a foundation and without subsidies, and with such expensive rent, it is appropriate for our students to share a portion of the expenses. Moreover, what the students pay is indeed only a part.</p>
<p>Although we pay very little, our benefits are very substantial. It can be said to be cheap and good. The principal is a chemist at a major pharmaceutical factory, and the physiology and hygiene education is given by a medical doctor. "Because there is no reward and the level is so high, the school's funding sources are very difficult." The principal often tells us this. Yes, because most of the students are adults who have dropped out of school, they are busy at work and take the time to study, which is completely different from those young ladies who enter school for diplomas. They cherish their time and also care for the school. When they encounter teachers who are not dedicated or whose level is not high enough, they kindly ask the principal to replace them. If the matter is true, the principal usually complies with the wishes of the majority.</p>
<p>Since we are based on the principle of self-reliance, all courses are mainly practical, eliminating the unnecessary and retaining the essential, teaching us how to behave in the world. Within the possible range, the authorities also introduce students to jobs, so that students can truly be self-reliant, sweat and earn their own meals in the family and in society, and be completely independent and free people.</p>

<h3>### Hospital Doctors Offer Preferential Treatment to Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(1) Hangzhou West Lake Hospital is located next to Broken Bridge, with mountains in the back and a lake in front. The air is fresh. It is a natural sanatorium for treating lung disease, stomach disease, anemia, and neurasthenia. Elementary school teachers and student assistants holding "Shen Bao" securities receive special preferential treatment and pay attention to cultivation, and can study and read on their own without wasting their studies. Director Yang Yusheng, Shanghai Liaison Office, Friendship Medical Society, 129 Avenue Notre Dame.</p>
<p>(2) Wang Boyuan, Director of the Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital at 32 Ward Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, wrote: "Elementary school teachers are poorly paid. Once pregnant, they cannot afford to go to an obstetrics hospital and are bound to hire a midwife at random, which is very dangerous. Your newspaper has launched a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers, but is lacking assistance for childbirth. Our hospital is located in Hongkou and is willing to serve female teachers in the nearby area. If your newspaper has a childbirth assistance certificate and comes to contact us first, we can send someone to provide services, and the delivery fee can be waived, to fulfill our duty to serve teachers."</p>
<p>(3) National Physician Yang Bofan wrote: "Your newspaper's launch of a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers is truly a pioneering initiative to cultivate future talents and consolidate the nation's vitality. After hearing about it, I was very envious. Unfortunately, I am a poor scholar and lack the ability to assist. I deeply regret this. Fortunately, I have inherited medical knowledge and can slightly assess heat and cold. I am willing to do my best to contribute to the cause. I sincerely respond to this initiative. From now on, if teachers do not abandon me and entrust me with medical consultations, I will do my best to treat them responsibly. The amount of consultation fees, whether large or small, or even free, is not important."</p>
<h3>### Mr. Shouzhuo Donates 2,000 Yuan to the Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" received a generous donation of 2,000 yuan from Mr. Shouzhuo yesterday. Mr. Shouzhuo's spirit of mutual assistance is truly admirable.</p>
