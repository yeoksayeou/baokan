<h3 id="c1">經濟建設全盤配合 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>經濟建設的目的，是在培餐國富，改善民生。因此，現代國家對於經濟建設，莫不積極從事發展。平時固然重要，而戰時尤爲重要，因爲戰時物資消耗較平時爲甚，爭取戰爭的勝利，一切經濟活動，側重於適應戰爭需要。同時，爲期戰後迅速恢復國力元氣，戰後提高人民經濟生活水準，尤其要着眼於經濟建設的推動。顧經濟的範圍至爲廣泛，而建設的技術又無止境，如何而可期全般經濟事業完全建設起來，以至於完成合乎理想的境地，自然是一樁極不容易辦到的事。可是，我們是一個積久貧弱的國家，是一個經濟組織基礎脆薄的國家，目前叉當對外作戰之時，在客觀環境上，十分迫切的需要積極從事於經濟建設，縱然極不容易完成，也必使用破釜沉舟的精神努力以赴。政府規訂計劃，切實執行於上，人民各出全力，協助推動於下，誠能上下一致，全國一心，深信必有完成的一日。</p>
<p>政府前會規訂三年建設計劃，近來推進至若何程度，我們未知其詳。不過，我們認爲政府一切的經濟措施，應該都與經濟建設整個有關，換言之，每一經濟措施，必須顧到與經濟建設的整僩關係，因爲經濟建設是整個體系，猶之一個人體，也猶之一架機器，如果人體上有一部份不適，便週身感到痛苦。如果機器上有一部份損壞，便整個失其靈活。經濟建設事業，如一件件分開觀察，縱使件件滿意，但聯合起來，中間如缺乏速鎖，則其結果，與人體一部分不適影響週身的痛苦，機器一部分損壞，影響全部失其靈活無異。因此，經濟建設的措施，應有整個的適當配合，不但使經濟建設各部鬥都有很好的成就，同時，更須注意全盤配合發展。</p>
<p>怎樣取得全盤的配合呢？這是政府無可旁貸的責任。我們建議，政府應有負責整個經濟建設的中央機構，這機構的中心任務，就是統籌全國經濟建設各部門的配合事宜。各部門建設計劃的推進與執行，可以交付各該主管機關負責分工實施，而彼此之間綜合聯繫的工作，就應由這中央機構負責。同時，民間經營經濟事業者，應自動的適應政府整個計劃，共同發展，如果僅以個人事業利益爲前提而各不相謀，其結果個人雖算成功，而集體仍屬失敗。爲了戰爭勝利的前途，經濟建設的前途，國計民生的前途，對此全盤配合問題，値得提出而朝野各界都應軍視的。</p>
<h3 id="c2">改善公敎人員待遇 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>公務人員，是執行政策政令者，行政效率的高低，是說明政策政令成效的有無。而行政效率的高低，就繫於公務人員的努力與否。敎師是敎育人才者，教育效率的高低，是說明人才的有無，而敎育效率的高低，就繫於敎師的努力與否。</p>
<p>一切事業的克舉，均須賴有適當人才，當然，人才的培養之道非僅敎育一端，而敎育則無疑是培養人才中最基本的一點。如言提高敎育效率，自應先從提高敎師待遇，使之安定最低限度生活。目前敎師待遇之菲薄，瀕於不能維持最低生活之痛苦，不僅敎師們一再發出迫切的要求，就是各界以及輿論方面也表示很關切的同情呼籲。</p>
<p>公務人員，尤其是低級公務員，論責任何等重大，論待遇異常菲薄，與敎師有同樣情形。國家耍求政治進步，而提高行政效率；耍求培養人才，而提高敎育效率；乃爲絕無置疑必要之事，然則關係行政興敎育效率的公敎人員之待遇，未能改善，誠是遺憾的事，而其結果，一部分公務人員遂營私舞弊，以滿足生活要求，一部分敎師則可改業者改業，否則亦沒精打來敷衍了事，以言效率，則南轅北轍。對於政治修明與培養人才之要求，更何從談起？</p>
<p>我們今天鄭重迫切的呼籲，提高公敎人員正當待遇，務使之能維持最低生活爲目標。在此物價動盪莫定之時，稍加津貼亦不能與物價競走。爲澈底安定公敎人員生活，我們主張發給實物。行政院前會通過之物資俸給制度，迄巳數月，未見具體實施。而公務人員額外配給米糧，聞自七月份起尙未發給。在未經確定整個辦法之前，盼望政府先行舉辦公敎人員隨任住所之直系親屬計口授給足够食糧，並對家庭負擔較重，人口衆多之公敎人員，特予救濟津貼補助。首先由各該機關學校根據公敎人員人事紀錄表報告之直系親屬之實際人數，調查審核無誤後，隨即計口授糧與津貼補助。如果政府對於這一點起碼條件未能辦到，那末，高唱廉潔政治與行政效率之說，實難辭虛僞無效之嫌。</p>

<p>南京三十日中央社電汪主席爲使全國高級軍政長官，朋瞭最近軍政外交形勢，及現階段努力之方針，特由軍事委員會會同行政院，召集全國高級軍政長官會談。自二十八日起至三十日止·會期共計三日。第一日上午九時，全體出席人員謁陵後，十時齊集國府大禮堂，恭聆主席訓話。是日下午，及第二日全日·第三日上午，由總軍司令部總參謀長，最高經濟顧問，最高軍事顧問，曁陸海軍專家，相繼演講。對於世界戰局，東亞戰局，及大束亞戰爭必勝信念，分析至爲詳盡。各日主席均蒞會主持。昨（三十）日下午，軍政長官會談，主席並親致訓話。全體聆聽之餘，均極感奮。至此憂國高級軍政長官會談，遂圓滿結束。</p>
<p>訓話原詞</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　本月二十八日上午九時，出席全國高級軍政長官會談各長官，詣國父陸園謁陵後，卞時全體齊集國府大禮堂，主席親臨訓話。就歐洲戰局，大東亞戰局，中日關係，及時局之邋展，作政治總報告、歷一時餘。三十日會談結束，主席再作訓示，指出今後努力兩大要義，憂體人員聆訓後，獲悉時局又躍進一更現實而更光明之新附段，於極端感奮之餘，益堅其爭取戰爭勝利，促進全面和平之信念。茲恭錄主席兩次訓話結論如左：</p>
<p>開會訓話</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭以來，凡是來亞的民衆，都發生種族的自覺，知這這次戰爭是東亞興廢存亡的戰爭。非共苦無以求同甘，非下了共死的決心，無以求同生。先進國日本，以其國力，以共明治維新以來所生聚教訓的一切精神力物質力，立於保衛東亞的前棧，以擊滅英美爲巳任。對於東亞同胞，中國滿洲國泰國，加緊善鄰友好的關係。對於緬甸菲律賓扶助其獨立、完成其建設現代國家的願望，對於英屬荷屬南洋殖民地，解故其政治上經濟上的桎梏，洗滌殖民地主義的餘毒。以道義精神相號召，期於團結東亞全體民衆，共同保衛東亞，實現共存共榮的建設。</p>
<p>就中日關係而論，於本年一月九日訂立提前交還租界，徹廢治外法權的協定。八月一日遂見之實行。中日關係基本條約，訂立於二寸九年十一月三十日，其時大東亞戰爭朱起·英美勢力依然盤據中國以內，顧慮環境，不得巳而有特殊約束。如駐兵問題，軍事上經濟上設置特殊地帶問題，都是由此而生的。大東亞戰爭以後，這種環境願慮，已經不存在了，因而有根本修疋的聲明。如今修正的原則巳經決定了，將來的新約、純然在善隣友好的立塲上、以獨立自由互惠平等爲不易之原則了。日本對於中國，除了同心協力，切斷英美關係，完遂大束亞戰爭之外，別無其他嬰求了。今日在座的抱洋諸君·也有以前是立於抗戰陣錢的，以前的抗戰認爲中日不能共存，如今中日共存，不但有理論可憑，並且有事實可證。抗戰的意義早巳失其存在了。只有心安理得的遵循着國父所昭示的大亞洲主義，與日本同心協力遇向前進，此外更無可走的路了。</p>
<p>眾慶方面應該知道，如果不向着這條路走、便會把中國送入悲慘的前程。例如現在重慶將中國領土供給美國作爲空軍根據地，武漢廣州等處所轟炸的，無非自己的同胞。這樣以自巳的土地，供給他人爲轟炸自己同胞之用，這是如何悲慘，我們萬萬不忍重慶這樣做。兄弟終是兄弟，重慶在良心上也萬萬不忍這樣做。</p>
<p>又如英美方慫恿重慶進攻緬甸，試想想緬甸是東亞同胞一份子，久受英帝國主義的壓制，最近纔得日本的扶助，培養出一些獨立的前茅孔子說得好，巳所不欲，勿極於人，我們中國想獨立自由，緬甸自然一樑也想獨立自由。電慶方而如果自覺爲東亞人，那麽追隨英美之後，向着這一個新獨立的緬甸進攻，定要他囘復到奴隸的境遇，這是何等的忍心害理，我們萬萬不忍重慶這樣做。兄弟終是兄弟，重慶在良心上也萬萬不忍這樣做。</p>
<p>一月寸一日，英美也曾向重慶提出廢止不平等條約。須知道今日中國以內，已無復英美的勢力存在了。他們依據鴉片戰爭以來的不平等條約所得到的特權，如租界治外法權等等。自大東亞戰爭以來，早巳被中日協力將他粉碎無餘了，英美在這時候來說廢約，比空口說白話更要無聊。况且還只是一張預期支票，其能否兌現，要到戰後才加以考慮，那麼連空口白話也說不上</p>
<p>今日的問題，不是英美在束亞的勢力能否恢復的問題，而是重慶能否　醒的問題。因爲英美在東亞的勢力，是絕對不能戰復的了。</p>
<p>英美今方傾其全力以向歐洲，歐洲的德國，其兵力與資源，遠非上次大戰可比。英美雖在海角得些小小便宜，而上陣以後，必大大的碰壁。即使一時不致全然崩潰，而長期戰是必然不免的，英美那有空閒在東亞恢復勢力呢。</p>
<p>英美在東亞的希望，全在蛊感重慶使之執逃不悟，在東亞團結的歷史上，留一些汚點。重慶如其終不覺醒，實在是可痛的。重慶今日的抗戰，巳與以前的抗戰意義全然不同。以前的抗戰因爲認中日不能兩存，現在理論事實着着證明中日可以兩存了·那麼還抗戰什麼。這不是爲中國而戰，乃爲英美而戰了。</p>
<p>右人以爲軍慶旣站在英美陣綫、此時如果脫離英美，豈不是和義國巴特里奧脫離軸心陣綫一樣嗎？大大不然，第一，中日衝突遠在歐洲戰事以前，·如今中日衝突的原因巳經消滅，中日衝突自然應該停止，不能與歐洲戰事混爲一起。第二，中日銜突的原因，現在巳經消滅固不俟言，而且因東亞的關係、中日團結巳經重新開始，其精誠堅固，遠過於以前，日本盡力援助中國完成獨立，中國盡力協助大東亞戰爭解放束亞·即以解放自己，光明正大，豈義國巴特里奥的背盟棄信所可同日而語。</p>
<p>我有一句話，兄弟終是兄弟，重慶終必和我們走一條路的。不過我所盼望的、是愈早愈好，不要徘徊觀望，增加同胞的痛苦。</p>
<p>在座的袍澤諸君，聽了我的報告同去之後，務必以這種眞貫的消息，確切的論斷，遍吿同僚及其部屬，使人人認淸時局，堅定信念。同時把大東亞戰爭的正義，與中國當前唯一解放的送徑，普遍宜傳及於全國，使全面和平早日實現，復興中華保衛東亞的使命，早日完成。</p>
<p>閉會訓話</p>
<p>前日開會時、鄙人就時局的眞相，大東亞戰爭的勝利基礎，本平日觀察，及此次在東京與東條首相及當局諸公談話所得·作扼要的報告。連日復承友軍各軍事當局，曁軍事經濟兩最高顧問，絛分縷析，作具體的說明。頃間又承與會各軍政長官坦懷相示·我們深信此次會談，大家得了不少寶貴的心得，同去之後。對同僚對部下，必能益發使其認識淸楚，信念堅定，同心協力爭取勝利，同時對全面和平，亦必能促進，如今祗有兩點要義。願向各軍政長官告。</p>
<p>爲在軍隊裏，應以陸海空軍軍人信條。在一般社會裏，應以新國民運動鋼要要爲中心信仰，使全國人民罰揮精神力，以加入總力戰。</p>
<p>爲保障人民生活，應從抑平物價安定金融着手，以期繼　增加人民之生產力。各地應打被地域經濟思想，使能爲統一的進行，平均的發展。謹以此兩點要義，自勗幷以相勗。</p>

<p>中央社訊　關於收貿棉紗棉布征稅辦法，所有征收手續，業經財政部稅務署參酌棉紗統稅稽征章程，訂定暫行收貿棉紗棉布時征收統稅手續十條，蘇經探得全文如下：</p>
<p>則政部稅務署暫行收買紗布時征收統稅手續</p>
<p>凡國內設廠製造之棉紗或兼製之棉布，於收買時尙朱繳稅出廠者，仍依照修正棉紗統稅稽征章程第六條之規定，由經征稅務機關，派員駐廠，按照收貿價格，征收百分之五統稅，發給完稅照，該項稅款由全國商業統制總會（以下簡稱商統會）繳納暫行記賬，其已繳稅出廠者，不必按照收買價格補征。</p>
<p>凡各該紗廠於出運棉紗或棉布之前，由商統會依式塡具運銷棉紗或棉布申請書，並由該會曁負貴人簽名藍章，送由各該駐廠員核明塡發棉紗或棉紗直接織成品完稅　。前項塡發之完稅照共爲四聯，將第一第二兩聯掣交商統會，由商統會負責人隨時備具收領稅照證，幷將第一聯截下於該聯正面之廠方藍章攔內，由商統會及負責人藍章後，一併送交駐廠員轉繳稅務署存核，其第二聯由商統會交運貨人持憑運貨出廠。</p>
<p>駐廠員於商統會憑完稅照第二聯連貨出廠時，仍依向章騐明貨照相符後，隨時於貨件每包外皮上加蓋「巳征統稅」字棧戳記·方可出運，以資識</p>
<p>駐廠員於收到商統會之收領稅照證及業經蓋章之完稅照第一聯後，應即連同報表等呈送稅務署，由署核明登賬，於規定期間憑收領稅照證向商統會收取稅款。前項駐廠員於繳送第一聯及收領稅照證時，同時應將該照第三聯及報衷等，繳送該管理區核轉該管稅務局存核，其稅照之第四聯，則由駐廠員留存備查。</p>
<p>凡逕由該紗廠運銷國外之紗布，應由商統會另行塡且運銷國外紗布申請書，送由稅務署核明塡發免稅運照，由商統會交由運貨人持憑運貨出廠，惟於出廠時，仍須將該免稅運照。交由駐廠員騐明登記，以資查考，其巳完稅出廠，再運銷國外者，得　規足退稅手續，申請退稅</p>
<p>凡商統會於各項由請書收領稅照證及稅照第一聯上所用蓋章之印鑑，應備具同樣兩份，分別送交稅務署及駐廠員以備查封</p>
<p>本手續所用申請書及收領稅照證式樣分別、另定之。</p>
<p>水手續暫以上海市區各紗廠適用爲限、在外埠各紗廠及上海各單純織廠之征稅及運銷手續另訂之。</p>
<p>凡未在本手續所規定事項，除照單之時效另依特定外，其關於退稅改運分運及查騐等辦法，得適用修正棉紗統稅稽征章程各條之規定辦理。</p>
<p>本丰續自呈准財政部備案日施行，如右未盧事宜，得隨時由稅務署呈請財政部修正之。</p>

<h3 id="c41">再論福利獎劵 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>自從木年六月間國府公布『福利獎券暫行條例」以後。直至最近，始由中央儲蓄會公告，首期福利獎券，自今日起閉始發行，十一月底開獎，獎金最大者爲一等獎一百萬元，最小者爲十三等獎二十元。</p>
<p>發行獎券以資收縮通貨之說，在今年春間，國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太耶氏卽曾說過：『國民政府此後或右以發行彩票和獎勵有獎儲蓄爲收囘通貨方策之一的考慮」由是而知七月初發行之特別儲蓄獎劵一千萬元，及上月下旬舉行之定期市獎儲蓄週，吸收游資達五自數十萬元，皆不過爲其先鋒隊。</p>
<p>古人說：「治亂國，用電典。」然「重典」而外，「重償」亦不失爲有效的方策。隨亂世而來的通貨膨漲，以及游資充斥，自未始不可以用重償方法，以爲收拾補救之道。本年六月九日本欄曾論「福利獎券」，但僅側重於「人民福利」一點，今日特再以「重償」一點，更申其意。</p>
<p>右人以爲獎券足以引起人民之僥倖心理，不足爲訓，然方今之世，人民僥倖心理，早巳不易抑制。政府發行各種獎券，尤其是「福利獎券，」倒底還能寓福利於僥倖之中，這是大家所應當認識的。</p>

<p>大通社云，關於商統會茶葉專業部之成立，因內部組織至今未曾整備完妥，故設立時期尙早，日　華方由茶葉業同業公曾聯合會代表，包括上海南京蘇州杭州蚌埠蕪湖靑波定　紹興鎭江無錫十一地區之同業公會，日方以中支　茶　業同業組會爲代表，句括上海南京蘇州杭州蕪湖蚌埠等地區之同藥組合云。</p>

<p>頃據全國商業統制總會。責人告記者稱：木會原沒有棉業專業委員會辦理一切棉業統制事宜，嗣因棉紗棉布業事令設立「收買棉紗棉布辦事處」實施收買、與前情形不同，經該會第七次理監事聯席會決定，將棉業專業委員會先行撤銷，進俟紗布收買工作完成之後，再另行組織機構辦理各項配給事務，惟目前收買棉花時期已全，亟待推行，非另組織機構，不足以資因應，近特在本會內設立棉花專業部，負責辦理收花工作，專業部並非委員會制理，僅設主任一人，副主任二人，主任一職暫由唐度事長兼，並聘童侶靑堤孝二君爲副主任云。</p>

<p>紡織　永安紡織最爲堅定，晨開之一剎那買戶喊價頗高，但不久卽回低。午刻平穩，下午步見抬高，以最高爲最後成交價，比前日再軋升，大生一三兩廠平渡，中紡信和美亞均見做小，於下午後者亦見軋升，美綸毛絨綸華染織成交在上日價左右，瑞泰毛織做開在票面倍半外，榮豐紡織堅定，小票面織造股僅鴻興小挫，安姓與大中華識造均堅定，景福衫襪降後回上。</p>
<p>百貨永安與新新公司在盤旋中，結果均在上日下午價之上，國貨獨疲弱無神，中國內衣亦於盤施中略降。</p>
<p>新藥　新亞藥廠下降後爲大戶提上，終與中法藥房各見削落，五洲中西新星藥廠亦各做小。均於午後巳復起。</p>
<p>金融　仍在進展者，乃仍少售戶，大陸銀行曾昻逾票面，後見回下，與上海浙興均見軋平。金城略高，鹽業略挫，通易信託</p>
<p>文化　商務與中華書局各見削低，乃補上日之未跌，世界書局趨穩。標準紙品門市今日開慕，有投資垂靑，因之做高，勸工與晋豐造紙均穩。</p>

<p>糧食　米糧因到稀見升，油糧喊價亦略形提高，惟交易皆屬不多。</p>
<p>藥材　昨因月終，交易見减，人心尙稱堅穩，藍以粵帮前曾辦進大批藥材，昨已付裝南運，故喊價略見提高。</p>
<p>人絲市仍盤旋，嗣因廠胃微動，八心稍露秀色，脚地尙堅。</p>
<p>茶葉　交易仍鮮進展，市上併求兩寂，行悄則在岑靜中略帶堅化，全市僅為丁爻泰罄茂椿兩茶號各進綠茶六七　，係永順茶行售出，其他花色，閒紅茶子賣貿變方在談判中。</p>
<p>日用品　肥皂雖已提高限價，但市勢仍疲、故市上買賣價格，仍在限價以內、同時此次五洲固本廠派貨突增，同業在市况困疲下，大多放棄出貨，火柴市勢亦被帶小。欲挽頺勢、恐非易事。</p>

<p>— 吳治展</p>
<p>糧食問題之重要性，夫人皆知，無庸贅述。茲就以往上海市之糧政，提其未善之處，再以管見所及，略述其今復應循之方針，以供當局之參考。</p>
<p>甲　過去辦理糧政失敗原因之檢討</p>
<p>一，人謀不喊凡事端在人爲，入爲且能勝天。過去糧政之失數，人才任用之不得專，機　擘運之不健滑，最是一大缺點。九月九日申報載有如下一段：「……自糧食部計劃統制米糧採運配給辦法以來，惟因種稱關係，及主管米糧採運機構組織之欠完善，以致影響配給戶口米……」。由是可　見過去之機積實有未盡善</p>
<p>二，無整個　求計劃　試觀近來上海米糧之配給，非惟不能按期配給，且數量視前更爲减少，其捉襟見肘之窘狀，顯然若揭。可見糧政當局無預立之計劃，未能及時綢經，使供求有條不紊，但得過且過，敷衍　貴。其能著效者幾希，而能不生民怨者更無矣。</p>
<p>三，糧食統制，未見厲行過去之糧食統制，似有外張內弛之情形在蓋雖在統制之下，而糧食黑市依舊存在，且黑市之　格，高出限價甚多，如米之限價爲每石六百元，而黑市竟達二千元一石之鉅，其影響有使生產之農人，不願以限價受統制機關之收貿，而樂於以黑市售與國戶販戶等。販戶購得後，復以傳遞之方式，轉售於另外之販戶，如是轉接販入上海市區，復右利可圓。統制是統制，黑市是黑市，形成不相關之局面·試問於統制之　　下，何得有此矛盾之現象？即退一步言，在一定範圍之下，買賣糧食是允許的，則其最低限度對於限價務必嚴協遵守。乃當局一放任之，任其以黑市價格，實行黑市販責，殊爲失策。蓋放任之結果，足以助長黑市之橫行，使統制工作遭受頗壞。其影響於糧食統制之施行與效用者，至爲嚴重。</p>
<p>四，配給數量，不足需要民以食爲天，欽食活，否則便有發生動亂少危。按過去配給之戶口涼，離我人需要者尙遠，於是黑市乘機孳生，尤當巨口糧遇右風波時，黑市更形猖獗。竊聞仁者不遠衆以舉義，旣欲達某項自的而舉辦一事·則）辦之務須澈底，使達目的而後止，否則恐有「非惟無益，　且害之」之患。過去上海之糧政，其辦理欠完善中，配給量之不足，實諸弊端中之大者也。倘此項弊端未能設法補救，則欲求糧食問題能上軌道、限價能實行，黑市能消滅，將如綠木以求魚，信其永難達到目的也。</p>
<p>以上皆過去糧政所以失敗之犖榮大端。他如政治力量之未充，運輸之限制糧食產區之治安等，莫不直接間接影響於糧政工作。尤以政治力量爲最重要，蓋國家之事，非藉強固之政治力量，便往往事倍功半，不能順利推進也</p>
<p>乙　今後應循之對策</p>
<p>一，愼擇人才，善籌機構過去之人謀不威，已如上述。旣疵於前，當徵於後。司馬光會說：「官稱職，萬務成治·」故今日之集務，當自愼擇人才着手。必先審其所能，然後授以職位，賦以權限，使能與權打成一片、聯與責融洽一起。完全公而忘私，而後方能才職相稱，萬務成治。而對於過去惟親舊故交是用之私而忘公之劣根性，務必加以棄絕。人才一有着落，謀　問題亦可解決過半矣。蓋主持有人，則施政有方，過去組織之有名無實而可不備者，則去之；有不可或缺之組織，而不健全者，則强化之：有應有未舉之組織，則增設之。使整個之機構組織有機地加以調整。如是方能產値　期之效率。譬如人之靈魂與軀幹，於相互調洽之下，方能表顯其爲「萬物之靈」，設二者缺一，便將成爲鬼影與僵屍矣、</p>
<p>二，確立整個供求計劃凡事預則立，不預則戰，是爲一定不易之眞理·尤其處於科學發達之今日，欲興舉一事業，必先對於該事業，加以完全之調查與認議，對象濟楚之後，方可着手進行，庶不致事倍而功半。辦理糧政、亦是此理。必先認淸其實情實况，根據認識，再據以確立供求之計劃。循此計劃以行，方有成功之希望。茲述要如後。、</p>
<p>華中米麥生產槪况　我國民食材料·以米麥居首要，米居第一，麥類其次。米麥合占我國民食材料遠百分之四十五以上，僅就華中所占地位言，當更重要，不待言喻。我國靡稻雖不少，惟中部長扛流域—華中—略有剩餘；麥類之產地，則廣遍於各省，足供自用。然則華中所產米麥，巳足供華中之自給，而過去洋米輸入者何也？爲答覆堅持上海糧政之失敗，由於來源缺乏論者，特解釋北原因如下：　洋米輸入所以補生產不足之區我國缺乏米殺最甚之區，非爲華中，而爲華南之廣東省。查民國八年，全國稻米之入超爲一百八十萬袒，而廣東獨占一百六十萬担（約占百分之八十九）：民國十二年，全國稻米入超爲二千二百餘萬袒，而廣東竟占一千七百餘萬袒（約占百分之七十七）。由是觀之，可知我國過去洋米輸入額中，廣東常居十分之七至十分之九。其爲非應華中之需要而輸入者，顯然可見。　外國糧食價低查民國二年至九年間，洋米進口價，均較販買價格爲高，故進口數量稀少。迨民國十年以後，一洋米進口價格，低於販賣價格，致述口數量激增。九此爲傾銷之當然結果。僅價格上之關係，初非華中一帶缺乏稻米有以致之也。　國產米麥品質多不良　輸入之米麥及麵粉等，多銷用於大城市。蓋此地之消費者，均求品質之優良，即廠家亦然。外國糧食自然應運而來。然對於華中之產量，並無關係。觀上三點，外國糧食之輸入，與華中之自給影響極小。今日雖外國糧食無法輸入·華中之生產量疋可自給也。</p>
<p>2華中米麥產量與上海市民需要量之估計</p>
<p>長扛下流米麥產量：</p>
<p>米稻——四三五·七四入·○○○袒</p>
<p>小麥——一二·○八七·七七三担</p>
<p>（附註：長江下流包括蘇皖鄂湘贛五省。麥類伸錄小麥，其他麥類如完全計入，其數最當更可觀</p>
<p>上海市民以五百萬人計。設每人每日至少需米麥一斤半，方得繪持生活，準此則憂上海市一年之需量爲二七。三七五。○○○担·約占長江下流米麥產量之百分之六·此區區之數·視全產量決不難取得。過去之配給量，每人每月至多寸五斤（米六升計九斤，麵粉六斤，）平均只每日半斤。而其辦理似已非常費方，誠覺難解。管見以爲所以如此，非華中之產量間題，實辦理不善右以致之也。</p>
<p>3採購及貯藏之計劃　觀上可見上海市所需之糧食，當可全部取給於華中。請再商時採購及貯薩之計劃如后：</p>
<p>子·探購計劃</p>
<p>採購之適期以各作物收獲期間爲最佳。蓄此時求售者旣多，收買自易。</p>
<p>採購區域分配宜先進行詳密之實地調查。藉調查所得，分盛產區域爲若干區。擬定各眩區之可能收買數量。俾一年所需之糧食，能於一定區域內，限期如數購全，而免日後之維掘，</p>
<p>採購價格之審定採購價格之高下·足以左右探購工作之成敗。蓋限價過低，則生產者將不戰出售。限價太高，則又徒有統制之名，不得統制之實惠矣。故必須加以精密之審定，庶免左右不利也</p>
<p>採購計劃之活用如逢芋藷馬鈴薯等登收之時，宜酌量採購配給之，以補米麥之一部份。蓋此等植物之營養價亦甚佳。後者向爲我國之救荒食物，糧植凄廣。淸代徐光啓氏曾竭力加以提倡，舉其利益達十三點之多云。</p>
<p>丑·貯藏計劃　新需之食糧購得　，非一日一月所能用盡。勞必設倉庫以貯之。按倉庫貯穀，在我國之歷史甚久，右常平倉·社倉·義倉等三種。聞當局業巳在舉辦中。本年九月五日申報記有如下一段：「糧食部：於各省適當地點，建設倉庫。蘇浙皖三省各地倉庫巳限期一完成。……」。至於此項在建造中之倉庫，是否與儲藏上海所需之糧食右關，則不詳。但倉庫之管理，更難於其建造。然當局巳有具體之計劃，茲不贅述。</p>
<p>寅·配給方法　過去之配給法·係計口授糧法。依據戶口册，核發買糧證，以憑領購，至善法也。今後可照舊辦理之。惟過去情形，其給領日期，精食種類。數量等，每每舊租界與南市異之，南市與浦東又異之。，甚至在同區之二地（如浦東之洋涇班與金家橋鎭），亦每有新綢·此糧情形，，非佳象·望今後當局能統一之。非惟便於管理，抑且使零售商難於舞弊。（鄕民晨陳，易受欺蒙）</p>
<p>三·糧食統制，須亂厲行雷　統制經濟爲現代經濟之新的方法·尤多重用於戰爭期間，以確立國家之戰時經濟。糧食統制爲統制經濟之一部門。德國於上次歐戰中，雄兵鐵騎，所向無敵，而卒以海口被封，糧食不濟，而吿失敗。糧食統制之重要價如？過去上海市之糧食，雖在統制管轄之下、終以統制不嚴，管理不善，朱見着效·使五百萬布民，日喘喘於飢餓綫上。殷不從遠幡然改圖，加緊統制，前途將不堪設想矣。茲述加緊統制之途如后：</p>
<p>1買賣統制</p>
<p>收買統制產區之食統制當爲，單獨行使。農產區之民營買賣，宜加以最大之限止，如强迫　行限價等是，並隨時調查其存貨，統制當局於必要時，得以公定限價收買之。對於秘密之國積，一經查出，除悉數沒收外，並治以應得罪名。如斯上海市所需之糧食，自不致右收購無着之虞。</p>
<p>售　統制　產區生產者之出售，由統制當局收買，已如上述。上海市民之需求，則完全實行計口售給，黑市出售者，麽予嚴懲。</p>
<p>2運輪統制凡糧食之運輸權，應由當局完全統制之。右私運者，即予治罪，並沒收其物資。</p>
<p>3價格統制公定價格宜絕對遵守。產區民管買賣亦應以公定價格爲準，藉防抬價而値黑市。</p>
<p>上述三項統制工作，如能完全澈底實行，則糧食間題當能斷上軌這，上海市民之糧食威脅當可解除矣。維持最低限度之配給量至此，可知過去糧政之失敗，非由於來源缺乏之結果。故對於今後增加配給量之可能性頗大。上述三點對第，倘已能完憂實行，則增加配給數量以維特市民最低限度之生活，當可指日可待。</p>
<p>上海市過去糧政之失敗原因，略如上述，共對策，亦巳經略陳槪要。如能澈底實施，上海市之民食問題，當可釋然解決。然百年之計，還在增加農業生產。先以政治力量，保護農民，使能安居樂業；繼以科學方法，實行農業推廣，增加生產。使達地能盡其利，則民食足之地步，民食足，則國本固。中國之前途，其庶有望乎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Overall Economic Construction Coordination <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of economic construction is to enrich the country and improve the people's livelihood. Therefore, modern countries are actively engaged in developing their economies. This is important in peacetime, but even more so in wartime. Because wartime material consumption is greater than in peacetime, winning the war requires all economic activities to focus on adapting to the needs of the war. At the same time, in order to quickly restore national strength and vitality after the war, and to improve the people's economic living standards after the war, we must especially focus on promoting economic construction. The scope of economics is extremely broad, and the techniques of construction are endless. How can we expect to completely build up all economic undertakings and achieve an ideal state? This is naturally a very difficult thing to do. However, we are a country that has been poor and weak for a long time, and our economic organizational foundation is fragile. Currently, we are also at war with foreign countries. Objectively, there is a very urgent need to actively engage in economic construction. Even if it is extremely difficult to complete, we must make every effort with a do-or-die spirit. The government formulates plans and earnestly implements them from above, and the people do their best to assist and promote them from below. If the top and bottom are united and the whole country is of one mind, I firmly believe that there will be a day of completion.</p>
<p>The government previously formulated a three-year construction plan. We do not know the details of how far it has progressed recently. However, we believe that all of the government's economic measures should be related to the entire economic construction. In other words, every economic measure must take into account its overall relationship with economic construction. Because economic construction is a whole system, like the human body, or like a machine. If one part of the human body is uncomfortable, the whole body feels pain. If one part of the machine is damaged, the whole thing loses its flexibility. Economic construction projects, if observed separately, even if each one is satisfactory, but when combined, if there is a lack of coordination in the middle, the result is no different from the pain caused by one part of the human body being uncomfortable affecting the whole body, or the damage of one part of the machine affecting the loss of flexibility of the whole. Therefore, the measures of economic construction should have overall proper coordination, not only to make each department of economic construction have good achievements, but also to pay attention to the overall coordinated development.</p>
<p>How to achieve overall coordination? This is the government's inescapable responsibility. We suggest that the government should have a central organization responsible for the entire economic construction. The central task of this organization is to coordinate the affairs of all departments of national economic construction. The promotion and implementation of construction plans in various departments can be entrusted to the responsible authorities to implement the division of labor, and the work of comprehensive connection between each other should be the responsibility of this central organization. At the same time, private economic operators should automatically adapt to the government's overall plan and develop together. If they only take the interests of individual businesses as the premise and do not cooperate with each other, the result will be that individuals may be successful, but the collective will still be a failure. For the sake of the future of the war victory, the future of economic construction, and the future of the national economy and the people's livelihood, this issue of overall coordination is worth raising, and all sectors of society should attach importance to it.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Improve the Treatment of Public School Personnel <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Civil servants are those who implement policies and decrees, and the level of administrative efficiency illustrates the effectiveness of policies and decrees. And the level of administrative efficiency depends on the efforts of civil servants. Teachers are those who educate talents, and the level of educational efficiency illustrates the existence of talents, and the level of educational efficiency depends on the efforts of teachers.</p>
<p>The success of all undertakings depends on appropriate talents. Of course, education is not the only way to cultivate talents, but education is undoubtedly the most basic point in cultivating talents. If we want to improve educational efficiency, we should first improve the treatment of teachers to stabilize their minimum living standards. At present, the meager treatment of teachers is on the verge of not being able to maintain the pain of minimum living, not only teachers have repeatedly issued urgent demands, but also all sectors of society and public opinion have expressed very concerned sympathy and appeals.</p>
<p>Civil servants, especially low-level civil servants, are responsible for any major responsibilities, and their treatment is extremely meager, with the same situation as teachers. The country wants political progress and improved administrative efficiency; it wants to cultivate talents and improve educational efficiency; it is undoubtedly necessary, but the treatment of public school personnel related to administrative and educational efficiency has not been improved, which is a regrettable thing, and as a result, some civil servants are engaged in private fraud to meet their living requirements, and some teachers change careers if they can, otherwise they will also do things perfunctorily without energy, and in terms of efficiency, it is a far cry from the goal. Where can we talk about the requirements for political improvement and talent cultivation?</p>
<p>Today, we solemnly and urgently call for raising the proper treatment of public school personnel, and strive to make them able to maintain their minimum living standards as the goal. At this time of fluctuating prices, a little subsidy cannot compete with the speed of prices. In order to thoroughly stabilize the lives of public school personnel, we advocate issuing in-kind benefits. The in-kind salary system passed by the Executive Yuan a few months ago has not been implemented in concrete terms. Moreover, the extra rations of rice and grain for civil servants have not been issued since July, according to reports. Before finalizing the whole method, we hope that the government will first organize the distribution of sufficient food to the direct relatives of public school personnel residing in the same place, and provide special relief subsidies to public school personnel with heavier family burdens and large populations. First, each agency or school should report the actual number of direct relatives reported in the personnel record forms of public school personnel, and after investigation and verification, the food and subsidies should be distributed accordingly. If the government fails to meet this minimum condition, then it is difficult to avoid the suspicion of hypocrisy and ineffectiveness when chanting about clean government and administrative efficiency.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 30th – Central News Agency: According to a diplomatic special correspondent quoted in the Stockholm newspaper, although the Anti-Axis countries support the Badoglio regime as the responsible authority for signing the treaty, they want to expand the regime to include liberals and leftists, and have informed Marshal Badoglio of this intention. Qualified sources in London announced that technically, Italy is still regarded as a defeated enemy, the armistice conditions are still valid, and the Anti-Axis countries' interpretation of these conditions depends on Italy's actions after the armistice and how effective Italy's war against Germany is. The Anti-Axis countries and the Badoglio faction have a common interest in driving the German army out of Italy.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Fierce Battle for the Dnieper River Bridgehead; Soviet Forces on the West Bank Heavily Encircled <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 30th – Central News Agency: According to news from the Eastern Front, since the Soviet army launched an offensive on the Sousa River front from east of Gomel to Smolensk, it has recently become more intense. The Soviet army has mobilized a reserve force, attempting to break through the south-eastern part of Belarus from the center. On the 29th, the battle situation became extremely tense. According to a German military announcement, the war line is connected to the Kiev front, so its trend has a significant impact on the fighting on the Dnieper River bridgehead. At present, the German army has also increased its new elite forces, trying to stop the Soviet army from advancing, and launching mobile counterattacks to defeat the main force of the Soviet army. Fierce fighting is currently underway. At the same time, it weakened the Soviet offensive against Mogilev and Minsk, but the Soviet offensive on the Vitebsk front is still very fierce. The German army is currently attacking the vanguard of the Soviet army in the Ruthenia region, a few kilometers inside the Belarusian border.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th – Central News Agency: The offensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front, from Chaplise to Kiev, a front line of 160 kilometers, has become fierce. Especially in the north-eastern area of Kiev, the Soviet army has tried to cross the west bank by using the islands in the middle of the Dnieper River, but the German army opened fire and destroyed all of its assault teams. The German positions on the Kiev bridgehead have not been shaken at all, and some Soviet troops that reached the west bank have been encircled, so it has no impact on the battle situation.</p>

On Sunday, German aircraft again bombed Porto Laco harbor on the island of Leros, and the damage caused was not as minor as previously reported. Three aircraft hangars and two fuel storage facilities were destroyed or burned. Five British Spitfire aircraft were shot down in the aerial battle, and another five naval aircraft and one flying boat were heavily damaged. The fire in the harbor continued for more than 24 hours. German aircraft also sank three transport ships, and their ships and cargo are thought to have been completely destroyed, with only the tops of the ships protruding from the water.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th – Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that the incessant torrential rain in southern Italy severely restricted military activities there on Tuesday. The Salerno area, previously guarded by British forces, is now guarded by American forces. Major General Clark's corps in that area is advancing along the highway from Vietri to the northwest, attempting to advance towards the plain northwest of Naples after the German troops divided into new positions in the mountains. The German army withdrew from Saint Giorgio, Baronissi, and Montoro after destroying all important military equipment. The enemy was completely unaware at the time, and only discovered it several hours later. The British and American forces launched a fierce attack along the highway from Vietri to Pompeii, encountering stubborn resistance from the German covering troops. The artillery fire arranged by the German army in the area was very clever, and the enemy's advance was blocked by concentrated artillery fire. The enemy's offensive was ineffective several times, and they retreated backwards without crossing the highway, leaving behind many dead and captured. On the eastern side, the German rear guard put up a strong resistance to the troops of General Montgomery, who attempted to advance by crossing the minefield. In some small-scale local conflicts, the British army suffered considerable losses, so the German rear guard was able to protect the large German forces moving towards the eastern side in order to establish new positions there. These new positions are located in the mountains and are more conducive to defense.</p>

<p>Geneva, 30th – Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that according to a diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail, Broadbent, there is a possibility that the "War and Peace" conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held in London instead. This location issue is currently being negotiated and decided by Washington and Moscow. The US government has recently requested that the Soviet Union suspend preparations for holding the meeting in Moscow, the reason being that US Secretary of State Hull himself wants to lead the US delegation, because Hull's health cannot withstand the long journey to the Soviet Union, especially in the autumn and winter seasons, so there is a discussion of changing the location. Last night, some speculated that the Soviet Union would agree to change its plans and send Foreign Commissar Molotov to lead the Soviet delegation to London for the meeting.</p>

All attendees listened intently and were greatly inspired. Thus, the conference of concerned senior military and political leaders concluded successfully.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At 9:00 AM on the 28th of this month, the leaders attending the national conference of senior military and political officials paid their respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. At 10:00 AM, all attendees gathered in the National Government Auditorium, where Chairman Wang personally delivered instructions. He gave a comprehensive political report on the European war situation, the Greater East Asia war situation, Sino-Japanese relations, and the trends of the current situation, lasting over an hour. At the conclusion of the conference on the 30th, Chairman Wang again gave instructions, pointing out two major essentials for future efforts. After listening to the instructions, all attendees learned that the current situation had leaped forward to a newer, more realistic, and brighter new phase. In addition to feeling extremely inspired, they strengthened their belief in striving for victory in the war and promoting comprehensive peace. The concluding remarks of Chairman Wang's two instructions are respectfully recorded below:</p>
<p>Instructions at the Opening Session</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, people of all races in Asia have developed a sense of racial self-awareness, knowing that this war is about the rise and fall, survival and demise of East Asia. Without sharing hardships, there can be no sharing of sweets; without the determination to share death, there can be no sharing of life. Japan, as an advanced country, has taken the lead in defending East Asia with its national power and all the spiritual and material strength accumulated and taught since the Meiji Restoration, with the mission of defeating Britain and the United States. It has strengthened good-neighborly and friendly relations with its East Asian brethren, China, Manchukuo, and Thailand. It has assisted Burma and the Philippines in their independence and the fulfillment of their aspirations to build modern nations. For the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, it has removed their political and economic shackles and cleansed the remnants of colonialism. It appeals with a spirit of righteousness, hoping to unite all the people of East Asia to jointly defend East Asia and realize the construction of co-existence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>As for Sino-Japanese relations, an agreement was signed on January 9th of this year to return concessions in advance and abolish extraterritorial rights. This was realized on August 1st. The Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations was signed on November 30, 1929. At that time, the Greater East Asia War had not yet begun, and British and American forces were still entrenched within China. Out of concern for the environment, there had to be special restrictions. Issues such as troop deployment and the establishment of special zones in military and economic affairs arose from this. After the Greater East Asia War, this environmental concern no longer existed, hence the declaration of fundamental revision. Now, the principles of revision have been decided. The future new treaty will be based purely on a good-neighborly and friendly standpoint, with independence, freedom, reciprocity, and equality as the unchanging principles. Japan has no other demands on China except to work together to cut off relations with Britain and the United States and complete the Greater East Asia War. Many of you present here were previously on the front lines of resistance. In the past, the resistance believed that China and Japan could not coexist. Now, the coexistence of China and Japan not only has a theoretical basis but also has factual proof. The meaning of resistance has long lost its existence. There is no other path but to follow the Greater Asianism that Sun Yat-sen proclaimed and work with Japan to move forward with one heart and one mind.</p>
<p>Chongqing should know that if it does not follow this path, it will send China into a tragic future. For example, Chongqing is now supplying Chinese territory to the United States as an air force base, and those being bombed in places like Wuhan and Guangzhou are none other than their own compatriots. It is truly tragic to use one's own land to provide others for the purpose of bombing one's own compatriots. We absolutely cannot bear for Chongqing to do this. Brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing should not bear to do this in good conscience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Britain and the United States are instigating Chongqing to attack Burma. Think about it, Burma is a member of the East Asian community, having long suffered oppression under British imperialism. Recently, it has received assistance from Japan to cultivate some pioneers of independence. Confucius said it well, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." If we Chinese want independence and freedom, Burma naturally wants independence and freedom as well. If the Chongqing side is aware that they are East Asians, then following Britain and the United States to attack a newly independent Burma, insisting on returning it to a state of slavery, is terribly heartless and unreasonable. We absolutely cannot bear for Chongqing to do this. Brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing should not bear to do this in good conscience.</p>
<p>On January 11th, Britain and the United States also proposed to Chongqing the abolition of unequal treaties. It must be known that there are no British or American forces within China today. The privileges they obtained based on the unequal treaties since the Opium War, such as concessions and extraterritorial rights, have long been crushed by the cooperation of China and Japan since the Greater East Asia War. For Britain and the United States to talk about abolishing treaties at this time is even more pointless than empty talk. Moreover, it is just a promissory note, and whether it can be cashed will only be considered after the war. It cannot even be considered empty talk.</p>
<p>The problem today is not whether British and American forces can be restored in East Asia, but whether Chongqing can awaken. Because British and American forces absolutely cannot be restored in East Asia.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are now focusing all their efforts on Europe. Germany in Europe has military strength and resources far surpassing those of the last World War. Although Britain and the United States may gain some small advantages at sea, they will certainly run into a brick wall once they engage in battle. Even if they do not completely collapse for a time, a long-term war is inevitable. How can Britain and the United States have time to restore their forces in East Asia?</p>
<p>Britain and the United States' hope in East Asia lies entirely in bewitching Chongqing, causing it to stubbornly persist in its errors and leave some stains on the history of East Asian unity. It is truly regrettable if Chongqing ultimately does not awaken. Chongqing's current resistance is completely different from the previous resistance. The previous resistance was because it was believed that China and Japan could not coexist. Now, theory and facts clearly prove that China and Japan can coexist, so what is the point of resisting? This is not fighting for China, but fighting for Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Some people may think that since Chongqing is standing on the British and American side, would it not be like Italy's Badoglio breaking away from the Axis powers if it were to break away from Britain and the United States at this time? This is far from the case. First, the Sino-Japanese conflict predates the European war. Now that the cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict has been eliminated, the Sino-Japanese conflict should naturally stop and cannot be confused with the European war. Second, it goes without saying that the cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict has now been eliminated. Moreover, due to East Asian relations, Sino-Japanese unity has already begun anew, and its sincerity and solidity far surpasses what it was before. Japan is doing its best to help China achieve independence, and China is doing its best to assist the Greater East Asia War in liberating East Asia, which is equivalent to liberating itself. It is open and righteous, how can it be compared to Italy's Badoglio's betrayal and abandonment of trust?</p>
<p>I have a word to say, brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing will ultimately walk the same path as us. However, what I hope for is the sooner the better, do not hesitate and wait, increasing the suffering of our compatriots.</p>
<p>All of you here, after hearing my report, must take this genuine news and definitive judgment to inform your colleagues and subordinates, so that everyone can clearly recognize the current situation and strengthen their beliefs. At the same time, propagate the righteousness of the Greater East Asia War and the only path to liberation for China today to the entire country, so that comprehensive peace can be achieved as soon as possible, and the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Instructions at the Closing Session</p>
<p>At the opening session the other day, I made a concise report on the truth of the current situation, the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, based on my daily observations and what I gained from my talks with Prime Minister Tojo and other officials in Tokyo this time. Over the past few days, I have also received detailed explanations from friendly military authorities and the two Supreme Military and Economic Advisors. Just now, I also received sincere sharing from the military and political leaders attending the conference. We deeply believe that this conference has given everyone a lot of valuable insights. After returning, you will surely be able to make your colleagues and subordinates understand more clearly and strengthen their beliefs, and work together to strive for victory. At the same time, you will also be able to promote comprehensive peace. Now, there are only two important points that I wish to tell all the military and political leaders.</p>
<p>Within the military, the soldiers' creed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force should be used. In general society, the outline of the New Citizens' Movement should be the central belief, so that the people of the country can exert their spiritual strength to join the total war effort.</p>
<p>In order to ensure people's livelihoods, efforts should begin with suppressing prices and stabilizing finance, in order to continue to increase the people's productivity. All localities should abandon regional economic thinking, so that they can proceed in a unified manner and develop equally. I offer these two important points to encourage myself and to encourage each other.</p>

<p>South Pacific War Situation Expected to Become Prolonged: Roosevelt Convenes War Meeting</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington news: Since Lord Mountbatten was appointed as the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, President Roosevelt convened the Pacific War Meeting for the first time yesterday. Beforehand, he also consulted with the four giants of Congress, namely Speaker of the House Rayburn, Majority Leader McCormack, President of the Senate and Vice President Wallace, and Majority Leader Barkley. It is believed that manpower and post-war issues were discussed at the meeting. American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, also paid a visit to the President yesterday to report on the situation in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, Senators Miller (Democrat) and Brewster (Republican), who had inspected the various war fronts by plane in the past two months, returned to Los Angeles from the Pacific front on the 29th. They told reporters: The most important thing on the Pacific front is to ensure transportation. The anti-Axis army, navy, and air force are currently implementing the closest joint operations in this regard. However, the Japanese army has a full understanding of the tactics of the anti-Axis forces, and they are also actively preparing for this. No matter how much the US military strengthens its combat power in that area, the future of the war should not be underestimated, so it cannot be expected that the war will end in a short period of time.</p>

<p>The sale of household oil based on housing donation certificates in the fifth district has been implemented successively in various districts. However, it has recently been found that some illegal retail oil shops are recklessly adulterating the allocated oil with water or replacing it with inferior oil for sale, which violates the principles of allocation and harms the people's food. The wholesalers have already dispatched personnel for secret investigations, and it is hoped that citizens will report any violations truthfully to the competent police station or wholesale office. If the investigation proves to be true, the allocation rights will be revoked and punished according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Municipal Propaganda Office Prepares to Celebrate Double Tenth Festival <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Municipal Propaganda Office believes that the Double Tenth National Day celebration is approaching. At a time when the Municipal Concession has been recovered and municipal administration has been unified, celebrating this Double Tenth Festival is of great significance. In order to expand the commemoration and celebrate enthusiastically, a liaison meeting was convened at 3:00 PM yesterday (30th) with various relevant municipal agencies to jointly plan the proceedings. Many important cases were decided at the meeting, including requesting the Navy Department to order a warship stationed in Shanghai to fire a salute at 12:00 PM on the Nanjing Road Huangpu River on the National Day, and sending propaganda teams to various downtown areas for street propaganda and distributing proclamations to the public.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Commercial Control Association Staff Not to Undertake Inspection Work <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>It has been verified that there are no restrictions on the movement of woolen textiles in this city. The Commercial Control Association has dispatched personnel to discuss this with the police authorities, and once verified, they will be released. However, foreigners are still unclear about the fact that woolen fabrics can be freely moved in this city, and there have been rumors that staff from the Commercial Control Association are working with the police to carry out searches, causing difficulties for woolen products.

<h3 id="e28">First and Third Police Bureau Deputy Director Watanabe Masami Travels to Japan; To Refresh Police Administration Upon Return to Shanghai <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Datong News Agency) The Times reported that Deputy Director Watanabe Masami of the Second and Third Police Bureaus left Shanghai for Tokyo yesterday morning on official business. According to well-informed sources, since the recovery of the two concessions, Watanabe Masami has been responsible for managing the police affairs of the First and Eighth Districts. At the same time, the unification of the organization of the two districts is also progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>Efforts to Integrate Police Affairs in Both Districts</p>
<p>It is understood that prior to August 1st, the organization of police officers in the First and Eighth Districts was not the same. However, since Watanabe Masami was assigned as Deputy Director of the Police Bureaus of the two districts under Mayor Chen Gongbo, efforts have been made to integrate the police affairs of the two districts, and plans are actively being made to create a system so that the First and Third Police Bureaus can cooperate and contact each other closely. Although the uniforms of the police officers in the two districts have not yet been standardized, the similarity of the cap badges already indicates unification. Currently, Chinese police officers bear a greater responsibility, especially for Chinese residents, in the police organization. They are like the keel that supports the entire body, so Chinese police officers should do their best to serve in the future. It has also been learned that Watanabe Masami is expected to return to Shanghai next week, and the First Police Bureau is expected to become a unified unit and be implemented immediately. The jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau has now been expanded to the old western district of Shanghai and part of the city center. However, in order to achieve good results in the planned plan, the relevant authorities are still in contact and consultation at any time.</p>

<p>The number of passengers traveling to and from Ningbo is increasing daily, and the available tickets are insufficient, leading to the rise of a "ticket scalping gang" and a black market for tickets. To improve the ticket distribution process, authorities announced that starting October 1st, all passengers traveling to Ningbo for business must provide a certificate with the official stamp of their company, factory, and responsible person, or other documents proving that they are indeed returning to their hometown for legitimate reasons and not reselling tickets. Otherwise, tickets will not be issued. Passengers are urged to cooperate with their companies to streamline travel procedures.</p>

<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, civilian police in the Eighth District (McTyeire District) are now on duty throughout the night. The district chief stated that drain covers, water faucets, and electric wires in the alleyways are often stolen by petty thieves late at night. Furthermore, the district has many small inns that often harbor criminals. Therefore, to establish public order, the district's civilian police are implementing overnight duty to combat theft.</p>
<p>Increased Duty Hours for the Eighth District</p>
<p>The original duty time for each shift of the civilian police in the Eighth District was two hours. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter from the Third Police Bureau, starting October 1st, the duty time for each shift has been extended to three hours, an increase of one hour from the original schedule.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Measures for Taxing the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: Ten Procedures for Collecting Unified Taxes <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Regarding the measures for taxing the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the tax collection procedures have been determined by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, with reference to the regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn. The ten procedures for the temporary collection of unified taxes on the purchase and sale of cotton yarn and cotton cloth are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Procedures of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for Collecting Unified Taxes During the Purchase and Sale of Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>For domestically manufactured cotton yarn or cotton cloth that is also produced, if the goods have not yet been taxed upon purchase and sale, the original Article 6 of the revised regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn will be followed. Tax authorities will dispatch personnel to the factory to collect a unified tax of 5% on the purchase price and issue a tax payment certificate. This tax will be paid by the National Commercial Control Council (hereinafter referred to as "Shang Tong Hui") and temporarily recorded in the account. If the goods have already been taxed, there is no need to make supplemental tax payments based on purchase price.</p>
<p>Before shipping cotton yarn or cotton cloth, each yarn factory will submit a completed application form for the transport and sale of cotton yarn or cotton cloth to Shang Tong Hui, signed and stamped by the council and its responsible person. This form will be sent to the resident factory representative for verification and issuance of a completed tax payment certificate for the cotton yarn or cotton yarn directly woven products. There will be four copies of the issued tax payment certificate. The first and second copies will be submitted to Shang Tong Hui, and the responsible person of Shang Tong Hui will provide a receipt for the certificate. The first copy will have the official seal of the factory affixed to it, and after Shang Tong Hui and its responsible person stamp it, it will be submitted to the resident factory representative to be forwarded to the Tax Department for storage and verification. The second copy will be given to the person transporting the goods for use in shipping the goods from the factory.</p>
<p>When Shang Tong Hui presents the second copy of the tax payment certificate to the resident factory representative to ship the goods from the factory, the representative will still verify the goods and the certificate to ensure that they match. Then, a stamp with the words "Unified Tax Paid" will be added to the outer packaging of each item to allow for identification during transport.</p>
<p>After receiving the receipt for the certificate from Shang Tong Hui and the first copy of the stamped tax payment certificate, the resident factory representative should immediately submit them along with relevant reports to the Tax Department for verification and accounting. During the specified period, the tax payments will be collected from Shang Tong Hui based on the receipt. At the same time that the first copy and the receipt are submitted, the third copy of the certificate and the report should be submitted to the managing district for review and transfer to the relevant tax bureau for storage and verification. The fourth copy of the certificate will be retained by the resident factory representative for future reference.</p>
<p>For yarn and cloth shipped directly abroad by the yarn factory, Shang Tong Hui must submit a separate application for shipping yarn and cloth abroad to the Tax Department for verification and issuance of a tax-free transport permit. The permit will be given to the person transporting the goods for use in shipping the goods from the factory. However, when the goods are shipped from the factory, the tax-free transport permit must still be verified and registered by the resident factory representative for future inspection. If the goods have already been taxed and are then shipped abroad, the standard tax refund procedures may be followed to apply for a tax refund.</p>
<p>The seals used by Shang Tong Hui on various application forms, receipts, and the first copy of the tax certificate must be identical. Two copies of each seal should be submitted to the Tax Department and the resident factory representative for verification.</p>
<p>The application form and receipt for these procedures will be determined separately.</p>
<p>These procedures are temporarily limited to yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area. The tax collection and transport procedures for yarn factories in other cities and pure weaving factories in Shanghai will be determined separately.</p>
<p>For matters not covered in these procedures, the regulations of the revised regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn shall apply to tax refunds, changes in transportation routes, distribution, and verification.</p>
<p>These procedures will be implemented from the date they are submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record. If there are any omissions, the Tax Department may submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for revision.</p>

<h3 id="e41">A Second Discussion on Welfare Lottery Tickets <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government announced the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery Tickets" in June of this year, it was not until recently that the Central Savings Society announced that the first welfare lottery tickets would be issued starting today, with the drawing to be held at the end of November. The largest prize is a first prize of one million yuan, and the smallest prize is a thirteenth prize of twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the idea of issuing lottery tickets to contract the currency, Mr. Shohachi Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, said in the spring of this year: "In the future, the National Government may consider issuing lottery tickets and encouraging prize-winning savings as one of the measures to recover currency." From this, it is known that the special savings lottery tickets of ten million yuan issued in early July and the regular market prize-winning savings week held in late last month, which absorbed hundreds of thousands of yuan in floating capital, were just the vanguard.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "To govern a chaotic country, use heavy laws." However, in addition to "heavy laws," "heavy rewards" are also an effective strategy. The currency inflation and abundance of floating capital that come with chaotic times can certainly be rectified with heavy rewards. In this column on June 9th, we discussed "Welfare Lottery Tickets," but only focused on the "people's welfare" aspect. Today, we will discuss the "heavy rewards" aspect to further elaborate on its meaning.</p>
<p>Some people believe that lottery tickets can arouse people's gambling mentality, which is not commendable. However, in today's world, it is already difficult to suppress people's gambling mentality. The government's issuance of various lottery tickets, especially "welfare lottery tickets," can ultimately integrate welfare into gambling, which is what everyone should recognize.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Business Community in This City Plans to Establish a National Federation of Commerce <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The business community in this city, with Shanghai as the national business champion and one of the world's six largest cities, had a National Chamber of Commerce Federation before the war to convey the government's will from above and communicate the conditions of the business community from below.</p>
<p>The relationship was close.</p>
<p>The effects were great. Due to a series of connections, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation was suspended until recently. Now, as the war progresses, it is particularly important for the rear to have a unified commercial organization as its support, especially as the government implements</p>
<p>commercial control</p>
<p>policies. If commercial organizations in various regions are scattered and not united, it will not only affect the prospects of the war, but also hinder the implementation of government policies. Therefore, the connection work of commercial organizations in various regions is very urgent. As a result, influential figures in the business community of this city are planning to initiate the establishment of a National Chamber of Commerce Federation. The method is to have the chambers of commerce of Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Nanjing as the initiators, and on the one hand,</p>
<p>report to the government</p>
<p>for approval according to law, and on the other hand, formally invite chambers of commerce from the three provinces and two cities, as well as the four provinces and three cities in the north, to join. Detailed and comprehensive methods are currently being secretly drafted by relevant personnel, and a preparatory committee will be formed to take charge of the matter.</p>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the establishment of the tea specialty department of the Shang Tong Hui has been delayed because the internal organization has not yet been fully prepared. The Chinese side is represented by the Tea Industry Association Federation, including the tea industry associations of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Qingbo, Shaoxing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi. The Japanese side is represented by the China Central Tea Industry Association, including the tea industry associations of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, and Bengbu.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Shang Tong Hui Establishes Cotton Specialty Department to Handle Cotton Purchasing Work <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>According to a responsible person from the National Commercial Control Council, the council originally had a Cotton Industry Professional Committee to handle all cotton industry control matters. Later, due to orders to establish a "Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Purchasing Office" to implement purchases, which was different from the previous situation, the council's seventh joint board meeting decided to first revoke the Cotton Industry Professional Committee. After the yarn and cloth purchasing work is completed, another organization will be formed to handle various allocation matters. However, the cotton purchasing season is now in full swing and needs to be promoted. Another organization must be formed to respond to the situation. Recently, a Cotton Specialty Department has been established within the council to be responsible for handling cotton purchasing work. The specialty department is not a committee system. It only has one director and two deputy directors. The position of director is temporarily held by Chairman Tang Du, and Tong Lüqing and Di Xiaoer have been hired as deputy directors.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Chinese stock market, due to the significant decline in the past two days, it triggered the activity of bargain hunters. Investor sentiment shifted from weak to strong, and at 2:45 PM, led by major investors making purchases, retail investors also jumped in to buy, and prices gradually rose. However, the closing prices were still slightly lower than the prices at noon the previous day, but higher than the final transaction prices in the afternoon. The dynamics of each stock are recorded below:</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile was the firmest. The opening bid was quite high, but soon fell back. It was stable at noon, and gradually rose in the afternoon, with the highest price being the final transaction price, which was higher than the previous day. Da Sheng 1, 2, and 3 factories were flat. China Textile, Xinhe, and Mei Ya all saw declines, and the latter also rose in the afternoon. Mei Lun, Wool, and Lunhua Dyeing were traded around the previous day's price. Rui Tai Wool was traded at more than 1.5 times its face value. Rong Feng Textile was firm. Among the small face value weaving stocks, only Hong Xing declined slightly. Anxing and Da Zhonghua Weaving were both firm. Jingfu Shirt and Socks fell and then rose.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On and Sincere Company fluctuated, and the final prices were higher than the previous afternoon's prices. National Goods was particularly weak and listless. China Underwear also declined slightly in the fluctuation.</p>
<p>New Medicines: Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory was pulled up by major investors after falling. The final prices of both China-France Pharmacy fell. Wu Zhou, China-West, and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factories also declined. All of them recovered in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Finance: The selling pressure was still low. Mainland Bank once exceeded its face value, but then fell back, and both Shanghai and Zhejiang Industrial were flat. Jin Cheng was slightly higher, and Salt Industry was slightly lower. Communication Easy Trust</p>
<p>Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore both fell, making up for the previous day's uncorrected losses. World Bookstore was stable. Standard Paper opened today, and investments were inclined to the stock, so it rose. Quan Gong and Jin Feng Paper were both stable.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity has recovered slightly, Huashang Electric was flat and weak, and Xiang Sheng Tricycle and Public Utilities Electrical were stable.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Declined significantly. New Yi, Lianhua, and Yongxing all fell slightly.</p>
<p>Industry: Jiu An and Da Zhonghua Industry were both flat and weak. Xin Ya Construction fell and then rose. Da Zhonghua Matches also fell slightly. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco were both slightly lower. Guohua and China Investment were still flat and weak. Xinghua Industry's new shares officially began trading today. Other: Mei Lin and Kang Yuan Canning were both slightly lower. Standard MSG was still being held up by major investors. Baoan Glass and Scientific Chemical were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds continued to decline yesterday. Investor sentiment remained weak, probably due to the end of the month, which made funds tight. When the stock market starts trading, most of them will gradually return to the right track. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened flat, then rose, but due to many selling households, the supply exceeded demand, and the final price was slightly lower than the previous day. Classes A, B, D, and E also followed suit.</p>
<p>Interbank Interest: The Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank interest rate was 0.8%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Grains: Rice and grains rose due to low supply. Oil grains also saw slightly higher bids, but transactions were generally low.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: Transactions decreased yesterday due to the end of the month. Investor sentiment remained fairly stable. Guangdong merchants had previously imported large quantities of medicinal materials, which were shipped south yesterday, so bids were slightly higher.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: The market remained fluctuating. Later, due to slight movement from the factory, a glimmer of hope emerged, and the foundation remained firm.</p>
<p>Tea: Transactions remained slow. The market was quiet, and prices were slightly firm in the quiet. Only Ding Yaotai and Qing Maochun, two tea companies, each imported six to seven cases of green tea, sold by Yongshun Tea Company. Discussions for other varieties, idle black tea sales and trade variations, were still underway.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Although the price limit for soap has been raised, the market is still weak, so the selling price in the market is still within the limit. At the same time, Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory suddenly increased its deliveries, and most of the industry gave up on shipping goods due to the difficult market conditions. The match market was also brought down. It will not be easy to reverse the decline.</p>

<p>Since the adoption of the plan to control and purchase wheat by the Flour and Wheat Specialty Committee, it has been proceeding according to the planned schedule. It has also formulated various measures for foreign exports and exchanges. According to reports, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange of Materials</p>
<p>The planned purchase volume for this year is 6.5 million bags, of which 2.5 million bags are assured. The implementation of new purchase strategies this year is more effective than in previous years, so there is no cause for pessimism. All parties have great expectations for the specialty committee. In addition, the Central China region lacks soybeans and coal, so some of the wheat will be exchanged for Manchurian soybeans and North China coal.</p>
<p>Committee Members Go North</p>
<p>According to reports, Sun Zhongli, the chief director of the Flour and Wheat Specialty Committee, and Inoue Yasutada, the deputy director, will travel to Beijing this week to explain the operating situation to relevant parties and the specialty committee of the North China Political Affairs Committee and discuss various wheat trade matters.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Speculation Retreats, Prices Fall <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities have severely cracked down on hoarding and implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth in this city, speculators have slightly restrained themselves. In particular, the authorities' efforts to smooth the exchange of materials and implement unified collection and allocation of all food items have suddenly curbed the fierce price increases of the past. Recently, prices have gradually fallen, and the burden on people's livelihoods has been significantly reduced. It is reported that most of the general floating capital in this city after the elimination of speculation has returned to the banks, seeking to invest in property construction projects. If production increases, transportation becomes active, and unified allocation is reasonably effective, then prices will definitely tend to decline step by step.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Grain Problem <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhizhan</p>
<p>The importance of the grain problem is known to everyone and need not be elaborated. Here, I will point out the shortcomings of the past grain administration in Shanghai, and then, based on my limited understanding, briefly describe the future policies that should be followed, for the reference of the authorities.</p>
<p>A. Review of the Reasons for Past Failures in Grain Administration</p>
<p>1. Human Factors Not Matching Expectations: Everything depends on human effort, and human effort can even overcome fate. A major shortcoming of past failures in grain administration was the improper appointment of talent and the lack of smooth operation of the administrative machinery. The Shen Bao newspaper of September 9th carried the following passage: "...Since the Ministry of Food planned to control the procurement, transportation, and distribution of rice, the inadequate organization of the rice procurement and transportation agencies has affected the rice distribution to households..." From this, it can be seen that the past mechanisms were not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>2. Lack of Overall Planning: Looking at the recent rice distribution in Shanghai, not only is it unable to be distributed on time, but the quantity is even less than before. The embarrassing situation of being stretched thin is clearly evident. It is clear that the grain administration authorities lacked pre-established plans and failed to prepare in time, so that supply and demand were disorganized and things were merely dealt with as they came, paying only superficial attention. Few measures were effective, and even fewer failed to arouse public resentment.</p>
<p>3. Failure to Strictly Enforce Grain Control: The past grain control seemed to be strict on the surface but lax internally. Although under control, the black market for grain still existed, and the prices on the black market were much higher than the controlled prices. For example, the controlled price of rice was 600 yuan per picul (stone), while the black market price reached as high as 2,000 yuan per picul. This caused farmers who produced grain to be unwilling to sell to the controlled agencies at the controlled price, and they were happy to sell to private merchants on the black market. After purchasing the grain, the merchants resold it to other merchants through a chain of transfers. In this way, it was transferred into the Shanghai urban area, where profits could be made. Control was control, and the black market was the black market, forming an unrelated situation. How could such a contradictory phenomenon exist under control? Even if we take a step back and say that the buying and selling of grain is allowed within a certain range, then at a minimum, the controlled price must be strictly observed. However, the authorities simply allowed it, allowing them to engage in black market sales at black market prices, which was a mistake. The result of this laxity was to fuel the rampant activity of the black market and undermine the control work. The impact on the implementation and effectiveness of grain control was extremely serious.</p>
<p>4. Insufficient Distribution Quantity: The people consider food as heaven, and they live by eating; otherwise, there is a danger of turmoil. The past amount of grain distributed to households was far from what people needed, so the black market took the opportunity to breed. Especially when grain rations encountered troubles, the black market became even more rampant. I have heard that benevolent people do not distance themselves from the masses to carry out righteousness. If you want to achieve a certain goal and carry out an event, then you must do it thoroughly, so that it reaches its goal and then stops, otherwise, I am afraid there will be a danger of "not only being useless but also harmful." In the past Shanghai grain administration, the lack of perfection in the handling of affairs and the insufficient distribution quantity were among the biggest shortcomings. If this shortcoming cannot be remedied, then to seek the grain problem to get on track, the controlled prices to be implemented, and the black market to be eliminated, will be like climbing a tree to catch fish, and it is believed that it will be forever difficult to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>The above are the major reasons for the failure of the past grain administration. Other factors, such as the lack of political power, transportation restrictions, and security in the grain-producing areas, all directly or indirectly affected the grain administration work. Political power is the most important, because national affairs often require strong political power, otherwise, they are often half as effective as they should be and cannot be promoted smoothly.</p>
<p>B. Countermeasures to be Followed in the Future</p>
<p>1. Carefully Select Talent and Plan Institutions Well: The past failures in human affairs have been described above. Since we have learned from the past, we should use it as a lesson for the future. Sima Guang once said, "If officials are competent, all affairs will be well-managed." Therefore, today's gatherings of affairs should start with the careful selection of talent. We must first examine their abilities, and then give them positions and grant them powers, so that they can integrate power with responsibility and combine connections with accountability. Only by being completely selfless and forgetting personal interests can we ensure that talent and position match, and all affairs are well-managed. We must abandon the inferior habit of only using relatives, old friends, and acquaintances, and forgetting public interests for personal gain. Once talent is in place, the problem of planning can also be more than half solved. If there are people in charge, then policy will be well-implemented. Those past organizations that were nominal and unnecessary should be eliminated; those indispensable organizations that were not sound should be strengthened; and those organizations that should have been established but were not should be added. Make the entire institutional organization organically adjusted. Only in this way can the expected efficiency be produced. For example, the soul and trunk of a person can only express themselves as "the spirit of all things" when they are mutually adjusted. If one of the two is missing, it will become a ghost and a zombie.</p>
<p>2. Establish a Complete Supply and Demand Plan: "Prepare in advance, and you will succeed; fail to prepare, and you will fail" is a constant and unchanging truth. Especially in today's era of scientific development, if you want to start a business, you must first conduct a complete investigation and recognition of the business. After the object is clear, you can start to proceed, so that you will not get twice the result with half the effort. The same principle applies to handling grain administration. You must first recognize the actual situation and conditions, and then establish a supply and demand plan based on this understanding. Follow this plan to proceed, and then there is hope of success. The main points are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) General Situation of Rice and Wheat Production in Central China: Rice and wheat are the main food materials of our people, with rice being the most important and wheat next. Rice and wheat together account for more than 45% of our people's food materials. Just looking at the position occupied by Central China, it is even more important, without saying. Although there is a lot of rice in our country, only the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River—Central China—have a slight surplus; the production area of wheat is widely spread throughout the provinces and is sufficient for self-sufficiency. So, is the rice and wheat produced in Central China enough for Central China's self-sufficiency, and why was foreign rice imported in the past? In order to answer those who insist that the failure of Shanghai's grain administration was due to a lack of supply, I would like to explain the following reasons: Foreign rice was imported to supplement areas with insufficient production. The area in our country with the most severe shortage of rice is not Central China, but Guangdong Province in South China. According to the investigation in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the national rice import surplus was 1.8 million dan, and Guangdong alone accounted for 1.6 million dan (about 89%); in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the national rice import surplus was more than 22 million dan, and Guangdong accounted for more than 17 million dan (about 77%). From this, we can see that Guangdong often accounted for 70% to 90% of the past foreign rice imports in our country. It is clear that it was not imported for the needs of Central China. Foreign food prices were low. From the second to the ninth years of the Republic of China, the import price of foreign rice was higher than the selling price, so the import volume was small. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, the import price of foreign rice was lower than the selling price, which led to a sharp increase in imports. This is the natural result of dumping. It was only a price relationship, and it was not caused by a lack of rice in Central China. The quality of domestic rice and wheat is mostly poor. Imported rice, wheat, and flour are mostly sold in big cities. This is because consumers in these places seek excellent quality, as do manufacturers. Foreign food naturally comes in response. However, it has nothing to do with the production of Central China. From the above three points, the import of foreign food has very little impact on the self-sufficiency of Central China. Even though foreign food cannot be imported today, Central China's production can be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>(2) Estimation of Rice and Wheat Production in Central China and the Needs of Shanghai Citizens:</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Production in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River:</p>
<p>Rice: 435,740,000 dan</p>
<p>Wheat: 120,877,773 dan</p>
<p>(Note: The lower reaches of the Yangtze River include the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Wheat only records wheat. If other types of wheat are fully included, the number should be even more considerable.)</p>
<p>Assuming that there are 5 million citizens in Shanghai, and that each person needs at least 1.5 catties of rice and wheat a day to maintain life, then the annual demand of Shanghai City is 27,375,000 dan, accounting for about 6% of the rice and wheat production in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This small number is definitely not difficult to obtain from the total production. In the past, the amount of distribution was at most 15 catties per person per month (9 catties of rice, calculated at 6 sheng, and 6 catties of flour), averaging only half a catty per day. And it seems that it has been very difficult to handle, which is really difficult to understand. In my humble opinion, the reason for this is not the question of the production of Central China, but it is caused by poor handling.</p>
<p>(3) Procurement and Storage Plan: From the above, it can be seen that the grain needed by Shanghai City should be able to be obtained entirely from Central China. Please discuss the procurement and storage plan as follows:</p>
<p>A. Procurement Plan:</p>
<p>The best time for procurement is during the harvest period of each crop. At this time, there are many people who want to sell, and it is easy to buy.</p>
<p>Regional allocation for procurement: A detailed on-site investigation should be conducted first. Based on the investigation, divide the producing areas into several areas. Formulate the possible purchase quantity for each area. So that the grain needed for a year can be purchased in full within a certain area and within a limited time, so as to avoid future excavation.</p>
<p>Examination and approval of procurement prices: The level of procurement prices is enough to determine the success or failure of the procurement work. If the controlled price is too low, producers will not want to sell. If the controlled price is too high, then there is only the name of control, and the benefits of control cannot be obtained. Therefore, it must be carefully examined and approved to avoid unfavorable situations.</p>
<p>Flexible use of the procurement plan: When taros, potatoes, and other crops are harvested, they should be purchased and distributed in appropriate quantities to supplement a portion of rice and wheat. The nutritional value of these plants is also very good. The latter has always been our country's famine relief food, and the grain planting is widespread. Xu Guangqi of the Qing Dynasty tried his best to promote it, citing as many as 13 benefits.</p>
<p>B. Storage Plan: The newly needed food is purchased, and it cannot be used up in a day or a month. It is necessary to set up warehouses to store it. According to the storage of grain in warehouses, our country has a long history, with three types: Ever-Normal Granary, Community Granary, and Charitable Granary. I heard that the authorities are already running it. The Shen Bao newspaper of September 5th of this year recorded the following passage: "The Ministry of Food is building warehouses in appropriate locations in various provinces. The warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been completed within a time limit..." As for whether this warehouse under construction is related to storing the grain needed by Shanghai, it is not known. However, the management of the warehouse is more difficult than its construction. However, the authorities already have a concrete plan, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>C. Distribution Method: The past distribution method was to distribute grain according to the number of people. According to the household registration book, grain purchase certificates were issued for purchase. This is a good method. It can be handled in the same way in the future. However, in the past, the date of issue, the type of staple food, and the quantity were different between the old concession and the Nanshi, and between the Nanshi and Pudong. Even in the same area (such as Yangjingbang and Jinjiaqiao Town in Pudong), there were often new preparations. This grain situation is not a good sign. It is hoped that the authorities can unify it in the future. This will not only facilitate management, but also make it difficult for retailers to commit fraud. (Villagers are foolish and easily deceived.)</p>
<p>3. Grain Control Must be Strictly Enforced: Control economics is a new method of modern economics, and it is often used during wartime to establish the country's wartime economy. Grain control is a department of control economics. During the last European war, Germany's mighty iron cavalry was invincible, but it eventually failed because the sea mouth was blocked, and the grain was insufficient. What is the importance of grain control? In the past, the grain in Shanghai City, although under the jurisdiction of control, eventually did not see any effect due to the lack of strict control and poor management, so that 5 million common people were panting on the line of hunger. If we do not learn from the past and change our ways, and tighten control, the future will be unimaginable. Here are the ways to tighten control:</p>
<p>(1) Buying and Selling Control:</p>
<p>Buying Control: Control of food in the production area should be exercised separately. Private buying and selling in agricultural areas should be limited as much as possible, such as forcing the implementation of controlled prices, and investigating their inventory at any time. The control authorities may purchase it at the officially set controlled price when necessary. For secret hoarding, once found, in addition to confiscating all of it, they will also be punished with the crimes they deserve. In this way, Shanghai City's need for grain will not be in danger of not being purchased.</p>
<p>Selling Control: The sale of producers in the production area is purchased by the control authorities, as described above. The demand of Shanghai citizens is completely implemented by selling according to the number of people, and those who sell on the black market will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation Control: All rights to transport grain should be completely controlled by the authorities. Those who transport privately will be prosecuted and their materials will be confiscated.</p>
<p>(3) Price Control: Officially set prices should be absolutely observed. Private buying and selling in the production area should also be based on officially set prices to prevent price increases and black markets.</p>
<p>If the above three control tasks can be fully and thoroughly implemented, then the grain problem will be able to get on track, and the threat of grain to Shanghai citizens can be lifted. Maintaining the minimum amount of distribution: From this, it can be known that the failure of the past grain administration was not due to a lack of supply. Therefore, the possibility of increasing the amount of distribution in the future is great. If the above three points can be fully and earnestly implemented, then increasing the amount of distribution to maintain the minimum living of citizens can be expected soon.</p>
<p>The reasons for the failure of Shanghai's past grain administration are briefly described above, and the countermeasures have also been briefly stated. If it can be thoroughly implemented, the food problem of Shanghai City can be solved clearly. However, the plan for a hundred years is still to increase agricultural production. First, use political power to protect farmers and enable them to live and work in peace; then, use scientific methods to implement agricultural extension and increase production. So that the land can be used to its full advantage, then the people will have sufficient food, and when the people have sufficient food, the foundation of the country will be solid. The future of China, I hope for it?</p>
