<p>社評</p>
<h3>確定戰時經濟政策</h3>
<p>戰時政治體制的大意，我們已在昨天談過。我們相信，只有政治修明，風氣革新，只有民意能爲政府採納，那麼國策才能够貫澈。但是，同時還不能忽視經濟。因爲經濟是政治的基礎，假使經濟的政策不健全，那麼，「未有民貧而國富者」。所以，戰時經濟政策的確定，有其不容或緩的重要性了。</p>
<p>但是，一國的經濟政策，無論爲戰時或平時，特別是在戰時，必須澈底明瞭本國經濟的特點，制定「對症發藥」的方策，否則，不是徒苦我民，便難免徒成具文。目前中國經濟的特點是什麼？</p>
<p>中國事變以還，中國廣大的地域上，發現了經濟恐慌的局面，農村破產了，城市的工業也都凋零或停頓了，國民經濟受到空前的破壞，所有勞働力，原料，交通運輸工具，以及一般人民的購買力，也都大非昔比了。</p>
<p>生產的發展，亦遭到嚴重的阻礙，所以，目前的戰時經濟政策，決不能抄襲別國的戰時經濟政策，因爲中國的戰時經濟政策，是建立在五六年來戰後民生凋敝不堪的基礎上面的，所以牠的特點，不應是單純的統制和配給制度的實施，而應該具有積極的鼓勵生產扶助生產的意義。</p>
<p>但是，僅靠這個經濟政策的原則還不够，我們一方面要對中國經濟有更進一步的澈底的了解，另一方面要在爲國家民族更遠大的前途着想，而愼重地確立經濟政策，牠雖然是戰時政策，同時是要顧到戰後經濟的復與和發展。</p>
<p>在這前提之下，我們一面先要認淸：過去中國經濟不能發展的最大原因，是受了英美勢力的無形的束縛，現在英美勢力雖已消滅，英美在華鏗濟的靈魂和制度，却還存在。其次，要知道過去中國的經濟政策，特別是重慶政權的經濟政策，是非常凌亂的，是沒有顧到國民全體的利益，是沒有顧到國家民族的百年大計，而只是追隨英美資本制度之後，爲英美資本家服務，忽視了整個國民經濟的發展。甚且在種種方面，阻滯了國民經濟的發展。第三，中國的經濟結構，以中小生產者佔優勢，小規模的商品生產，佔着極大的比重。農村生產和手工業生產固然如此，就是新式工業又何嘗不然？如果不正，中國經濟這種種特點，而抄襲別國的經濟政策，結果便將徒然增加人民和民族經濟的困苦而已。第四，我們無庸諱言，在這大東亞戰爭過程中，爲了中日切實協力爭取勝利，我國的經濟政策，不能不和日本保持緊密的聯繫，特別是在物資和勞働力方面，中國勢非盡相當義務不可，否則，還說什麼參戰呢？不過，我們同時應該提醒中日當局和中日經濟界注意者，我們大家所提倡和理想的中日共存共榮，不只是爲了今日戰時的協力，而是有着更遠大的前途，這就是戰後悠長歲月的永遠的協力合作。所以，今日的經濟政策，決不能說只要配合着大東亞戰爭的臨時的需要就够了，而且還得計劃得更遠大些，計劃到戰後兩國的和平合作。只有讓中國經濟走上合理發展的正軌，使中團的農業工業有着均衡而合理的發展，那是中國民族之利，也未嘗不能給日本戰時經濟以更大的助力。</p>
<p>基本的前提和任務確定以後，對於經濟的內容，我們覺得應該注意到下列幾個比較具體的意見：</p>
<p>第一，在企業上，除了積極建設國營事業之外，必須保護與扶助私人資本的發展。中國的產業是很可憐的。在這種情形之下，應該是增加生產，而不應是消極的限制。發展國營企業的作用，是在解決一部份物資的需要，並推動民營事業之發展，決不應壟斷獨占，也不應與民爭利。對於民營企業，一面要資助大規模的，同時，切不可忽視中小生產，在這裏，合作事業是必須切實提倡的。</p>
<p>第二，在生產關係上，工業方面，必須改善勞資關係，必須改善工人待遇。在農業方面，更須公平合理的解決租佃關係。不論爲工業或農業，對於經營者及工農勞動者，必須盡力避免引起反感，盡力减少其負担與不便，積極的保障其合理的利益，並設法扶助其發展生產。</p>
<p>第三，在金融和財政上，必須嚴禁銀行錢莊之商品投機，引導游資入於生產事業，使用一切合理的方法，使通貨的膨脹程度减低。而在稅制·公債等方面，更力謀刷新改善。</p>
<p>此外，如改善交通運輸，增加交通運輸工具：如切實根絕囤積居奇，扶助中小商人營業；尤其是在和平區內，改善檢查製度，慎重選用訓練及考核檢查人員，特別注意於重大的過犯者的懲辦，而對於一般小商人及平民則不必作過苛的留難。</p>
<p>我們所見到而思慮所及，最緊要的就是上述幾點。不過，說到戰時經濟，仍有賴於政治的改善。只有良好的政治，尤其是良好而廉潔的各級政治幹部，才能保障戰時經濟健全發展。我們竭誠希望各方面注意及此，進而有以慰我庶民的喁望。</p>

<h3>國府宣布參戰後　東亞已結成一體　英美遭受嚴重打擊　德義表示熱烈歡迎</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德外交部當局對國民政府參戰及日本撤廢在華治外法權與交還專管租界事、於九日表明見解稱、此次中國國民政府毅然對英、美宣戰、此足以表示國民政府於此次戰爭中、對日、德、義三盟國勝利已抱有堅定之信念、且較此更重要者即中國之人口舉世罕匹、以擁有數億人口之國民政府參加軸心戰綫、從事對英、美作戰、其力量自頗可觀、而中、日兩國亦因此能結成共同戰綫、又日本在國府領土內撤廢治外法權、並交還專管租界一事、尤爲重要、蓋英、美兩國與渝方爲取消治外法權問題、曾交涉經年、此次日本自動拋棄在華治外法權、此足以證明日本對國民政府眞摯友好之態度、中日兩國權利平等、亦於此確立、同時英、美所作日本壓迫中國之宣傳、亦因此悉被粉碎、吾人對國府治下之中國國民奮起參加軸心國對英、美作戰、衷心至爲歡迎、</p>
<p>柏林十日海通社電　據此間政界人士稱、中國國民政府宣戰後、從此二萬五千萬中國人民亦同站於對付英、美之戰綫上、其意義之重大、自不待言、德國各報咸競載此項消息及中日二國對此發展所發表之言論、柏林人士繼謂此舉殊僥興趣、蓋使羅斯福復遭遇一不幸、彼所發表之白皮書所引起之反　　爲薄弱、反受國會之責難、窘態畢露、今則復受到此一重大打擊、</p>

<p>東京十日海通通社電　朝日新聞發表社評稱、中國之參慇、乃爲更進一步實行孫中山先生之大亞洲主義、中、日兩國今在軍事上、政治上、經濟是已結成　體、而南京與德、義、泰等國之關係、亦因之愈趨密切、日本今旣已放棄其在華之租界及領事裁判權、重慶當無所藉口矣、</p>

<h3>近衛談話</h3>
<p>束京十日中央社電　日前總理大臣近衛公、於十日上午在此間荻窪私邸就國府參戰及日本交還租界撤廢治外法權發表談話、大要如次、中國之建設、除將英·美由東亞逐出及求大東亞戰爭之勝利外、實無他法完成、此乃孫中山先生大亞洲主義之當然歸趨、故此次國府之參戰、結果亦不外係此主義之實現、聞渝方內部亦有人對於寓一日本失敗後東亞全局之將來加以深切之省察、有人認爲此時中國之立塲決非有利、其實除十分受美國麻醉之蔣介石及宋氏一家外、其餘有心之士、當將漸次趨於此種意向、且渝方一部份相當有力人士、對於美國在中國領土任意賣弄其飛機與武器亦頗表憤懣、此亦爲當然之事、蓋中國之自主獨立、唯於孫總理之主義中始可獲得、此點亦應爲中國人士所熟知、總之中國之參戰與帝國之交還租界及撤廢治外法權、由中國言之、係大亞洲主義之發展、在我國言之、則可謂淵源於宣戰大詔之精神、</p>
<h3>好富部長談話</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　日大使館好富情報部長頃發表談話如次、此次中日協定締結後、中國已恢復鴉片戰爭以前所失去之主權、獲得完全之獨立、過去中國任何政府亦不可實現之舉、今已由國民政府實現之、此實爲中國歷史上劃期之偉大貢獻、國民政府之一大成功、據外電國民政府此次宜戰、予美英以極大衝動、目下英美正考慮善後策畫中、但依余之想像、由於此次中日新協定之成立、中國所恢復之上海、厦門之公共租界、以及北京公使館區域等、英美亦曾一度申明交還渝方、原來英美對於於己無損之租界及治外法權、恒以所謂正義人道之名行之、並誇大宜傳、爲共一貫欺騙之手段、其實上海·厦門之公共租界與北京公使館區域均已在日本之勢力下、故英美雖申明將其交還渝方、實亦不感任何痛癢、而全係愚弄中國國民之傳統政策、此適益加深中國國民對英美輕蔑之觀念、减少依賴渝方之信心而已、</p>
<h3>甘地一封信　英國在印行爲　美決不能卸責　一月六日澳門轉來</h3>

<h3>渝美間的矛盾　熊式輝遭受白眼　林語堂冷笑熱嘲</h3>
<p>（里斯本一日同盟社電）紐約來電，以拖戰重慶之宣傳員聞名的中國評論家林語堂，於一日在紐約發表聲明書，對於美國冷待熊式輝所領導之蔣政權遣美使節團，終使其未得一物而返國，甚表憤慨。抨擊美政府之冷淡態度，有如下舉：</p>
<p>美國政府對於以熊式輝爲領袖之重慶軍事使節團，極爲冷待，使存在於渝美兩國國民間之友好的感情，大受影響。余之見解，以爲美國政府受英國之影響，已改變其方針，目前傾其主力於打倒德國。而在東亞方面，則美軍之狀態，僅爲被利用以恢復英帝國之殖民地而已。余對於熊式輝已至不得已而歸國之事，極抱遺憾，而又不欲明言，故請在美國國民之前，提出一個質問。卽反軸心國之領袖，現在不稍表示其與重慶共同對日作戰之意向，則熊式輝逗留於華盛頓，尚有何種價值乎？彼原係一不慣於虛度歲月者，最近不得巳而徒費時日，結果已爲焦躁之念所驅笑。爲請美國國民理解彼之心境計，以爲不妨設一如次之　喻，假定諸君訪問友人之家，被留於客室僻處之一隅，不要說七個月，僅七分鐘之間，求蒙一顧，則諸君必恐有失禮貌，將努力於臉上保持微笑乎！微笑七分鐘閒，未有何種招持，則諸君將感滑稽而憤慨乎！斯時諸君果將如何處之耶？余意諸君必將鄭重盡禮告別主人而去也。歸國之後，諸君如解幽默則必將一切視爲滑稽而笑耳。今欲離美而歸重慶之彼，其立塲正與此相似。美國政府必滿意於渝美間存在之友好的感情，並望其無限存續者。渝方歡喜美國人，無何種特別理由，只是無所爲而歡喜美國人而已。是以若一度破壞其友好的感情，則連繫渝美兩國者，將無一物存在。熊式輝之訪美，非爲專以獲得援助而來，獲得援助不過其使命之一部分耳。彼實爲將貸一臂之力於確立共同戰綫而訪美者，然而美國却不欲得彼之助力，故彼之回渝，亦出於不得已耳。將來反軸心國確立對日共同作戰之準備完成時，美軍特領可赴重慶而受熊式輝之指揮也。美國國民應勿忘此一事實，卽此次遣美軍事使節團，實係經過愼重之人選而任命者，並以最優秀之對日軍事專門家之一，爲其領袖。美國國民必在問重慶感到憤懣乎？然而重慶所感者並非憤懣，熊式輝係奉老子之敎者，故恐其對於欲使美軍首腦理得重慶亦爲美國之同盟國一事，感覺無益耳。信奉道敎者，除嗤笑斯種之愚外，別無何法。</p>

<h3>林世良等貪污舞弊案（完續）</h3>
<p>旋提審被告林世良。林氏身着深藍色呢長夾袍，頭髪蓬鬆，鼻樑上架銀白色眼鏡，神色頹唐而慘白，步入法庭後審官即一一詢問。據稱：林世良，卅七歲，前任「中央信託局運輸處」主任。章德武係在仰光認識才數月，並無不睦之處。今年一月間，仰光最危急時，知其有大批貨物無法搶運，請求設法，我乃與章氏簽訂合同，後即報告許性初，並得其認可之回信，雖然信託局並無規定爲此事與局方有利無害，而又因時間不及請示，前既得許性初允許酌辦，故未通知昆明分局，即已進行。問其貨物被扣後，是否曾至檢查所交涉認貨。林氏供稱：是。又問：你事前有否商允章德武，運內貨物，平價供銷各政府機關？林供：在仰光時，已提過內運後必須依原價售與各機關。又問其合同內容　點，及卅五輛卡車主人。林供稱：合同訂明卅五輛卡車不在合同範圍之內，並言明該貨定價三千萬元，以信託局名義運昆，沿途費用及意外損失均由大成公司負擔，貨抵昆明後，由信託局全部收購，如局不欲承受，亦須付運輸佣金。最後問，該項價值既僅三千萬元，則於信託局並無大利。林供稱：因爲物價上漲過一月後，則價可達四千萬元，故認爲有利於信託局。</p>
<p>最後傳訊許性初　供稱：年三十二歲，現任「信託局理事會」秘書主任，兼該局購料處經理職務。最近因爲內部組織關係，九月十八日奉令辭去兼職。本局購料處係受　　關委託購辦材料者，信託局無權賣買。至於巨量資金，須否經理事會核定，係手續問題，本案合同成立，係根　票　審核後在渝簽訂。關於手續費及　備金均可補交倘無保險單者，則須先交。貨物運至昆明被扣事，係於代運手續辦妥後方始知悉，故於三月十日簽訂合同。問到林氏謂事前曾得許認可一事，許稱：我回信答應他原則上酌辦，信於前一月二十日發出，因爲該信係私人信件，故未登記及歸檔。三月十三日給統制局之公函，係我簽字。汽車當時並未清楚誰屬。至於林世良稱我於其出發仰光時，曾囑注意大批國防材料，以供給購料處一節，確是事實。審判員當宣佈本案審理終結依法定期宣判。</p>
<p>（又訊）據悉：林世良貪污舞弊一案，十七日由「軍法執行總監」審訊後，除該被告林世良一名依法還押該部看守所外，該被告許性初一名，前因尚有「信託局理事會」秘書主任之職務在身，未能擅離，經由該　依法准予保釋在外。茲經此次審訊後，認爲有與本案有關之嫌疑，亦經該部當塲扣押，聽候判決法辦。</p>
<p>「按本案主犯林世良業已判處死刑，許性初處有期徒刑五年，詳細情形容再寄　。」（三十一年十二月十日寄）</p>

<h3>大東亞之經濟基礎與資源開發　—譯自三十一年十二月經濟學者—</h3>
<p>開發的基本方針</p>
<p>昭和十七年（中華民國三十一年）度的物　計畫（即關於物資動員之計畫—譯者）裏，有着這樣的話：「重要物資之一部，當期待於南方佔領地，並期具確保。　聞關於煤油的需給，擬自南方佔領地域取得之，現已在作特別的考慮與籌畫中云。又在第二次生產力擴充計畫之昭和十七年份計畫裏，也有這樣的話：「照應資材之需給，及南方資源取得上之　事態，在生產擴充旣定計畫中，得爲所要之修正。」故南方物資，在今後生產力的確保中，檐當着有力的任務，這是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>不過闢於南方資源的開發，尤其關於重要物資的利用，顯示着有所　船舶關係的限制，可知南方資源之對於日本生產力方面的貢獻，是受着限制的。而見獨　於重要國防資源，南方諸地域，　即包含這些地域的大東亞共榮圈，其巳開發的資源，並不如一般所想的那樣豐富。</p>
<p>然而無論如何，南方資源對於日本極其重要，這是不待說的。隨着探查的進展，未發見的礦物之發見，更大的埋藏量之確定等，均將逐次見諸事實的吧。</p>
<p>關於南方開發的事，東條首相業於本年一月二十三日在衆議院總會席上，發表了四個原則，作爲大東亞共榮圈建設的永久方策。而鈴木企畫院總裁，所　明的左列六點，則把它加以具體的說明了。</p>
<p>（一）南方資源中，有急須開發者，有可較緩開發者，其開發的順序，隨戰局的推移而定，審查該資源需要的緩急及輸送的狀　等，將　審定的人綱，交中央決定之。</p>
<p>（二）被認爲必須緊急　發者，如煤油，礦產，農林等，實施開發時，當避免綜合公司或共同企粱等的形態，務使有經騐能力者，充分發揮其熱　與創意，使實行　率的生產爲原則。因此，在當地多年辛苦經營的日本人企業，或雖非日人而對於日本表示協力誠意之原來的企業者，均得活用之。</p>
<p>（三）關於通貨，暫時用常地表示的軍票，　與當地通貨等價流通，隨情勢所許，得逐次調整當地通貨與軍票的機能，使其歸於統一。</p>
<p>（四）暫時與當地之間　　資金移動，資源開發　需之資金，由當地之南方　發金庫，圓滑　通之。</p>
<p>（五）與當地之交易，無論輸出輸人，均由政府行之，至於採貨及配給等，當然利用向來的日本商人，以及與日方協力的當地人，及華僑等之組織與信用。</p>
<p>（六）對於敵國，凡南方地域出產之橡皮，錫，馬尼刺蔴等之當地特產資源，當極力採取之供給的　策。</p>
<p>依着上述根本方針而行的南方開發，在大東亞建設審議會「礦業，了業，及電力建設基本方策」中，表示　進行中的狀况云：「南方目下着重於礦業及煤油　業的振興，同時，關於各種特產物加工處理的工業，亦在振興之中，且隨逐　之水力發雷的開發，擬作鋁工業的擴充。輕工業，除現存者加以整頓外，依照資　賦存的狀况，遂次期其發展」。</p>
<p>以下就主要的開　　業，分別述之。</p>
<p>龐大的電源計畫</p>
<p>荷蘭政府於一年前着于建設的大發電計畫，　利用阿薩萊河之水流者，該河　走於蘇門答臘島中部，山脊梁山脈中的侍　湖流出，因這次　爭，工程業已停頓，現凡施工之處，由當地軍隊維持着。該工程於完成之　，已具有能供給○○　基羅瓦特之能力。這個大發電所的　設計畫，將來對於　蘇門答臘　馬來方面之日本電業開發，有極大的啟示。因此，大受注目，據馬來軍政部顧問增永元　氏之發電所調查結果云：</p>
<p>「發電所的位　，在　阿遜河水源十六公里之地點，該河係特　湖的水流向　東　注於　六甲海峽之水　。該處　建有威爾赫　姆東一　電所。更距此數公里之　，則　第一發電所的　定地。因　水流從高　九百公尺山頂上之特巴瀾流落，勢如急湍，故　水力極爲豐富。第一發電所的落差爲○○○公尺，第二發電所的落差爲○○○公尺。承辦該工程之皮利吞公司，得荷蘭政府之援助，於三年之前，已動工建設了。屬於第一期計畫之第一發電所，已裝就○○○○○基羅發電機，（其中○基羅爲預備機）　而堤防及其他各種工程，亦平均進展到二成模樣。第二發電所，則僅具計畫而已，尚未動工。其機件據說在開戰之前不久，已向央，美，瑞士等國定購中云。</p>
<p>若工程　緊進行，則預計在一年之間，可以完成。但荷蘭方面，似擬在距第　發電　六十公里之下流　點，建設礬土（Alumina）工塲　俾實行礬士的大量生產。其地點今尚遺有工廠地基及建築塲。發電所的機械　已被敵人破壞，工程用具等，正在山居民搬運，基　工程，則仍保其原狀。如　荷　當局當初約計畫完成，則可得○○　基羅力特的電力。所　○○萬基羅瓦特，日本內地最大　發電所，方能力恐尚　○○基羅以下，所以其電力之豐富，殊足驚人。而且水量豐富，在地形上又極有利，因此能供、代價　東的電力。照余估計，其一基羅瓦特小時之電，需費僅二厘五毫左右，而在日本內地，則一基羅瓦特小時之電　，大概需一分五厘，故其代價之低廉，　不能比較的一。</p>
<p>關於這蘇門答臘的電原開發，日本氮素公司曾獲得蘇門答臘軍。當局的諒解，爲使開發　畫具　化起　，前已着手調查地土條件，聞其調查業已完畢，最近即　積極　工了。又據說日電方供給　爲○○萬基羅云。（才譯）</p>
<p>礦業方針</p>
<p>先　東印　政府以供給火車燃料爲日的，採　欽附近的良　，　祇爲小規模的試　而已。　出　煤，山臨時敷設　輕便鐵道，自　欽　至　阿拉休姆，更　官　的南蘇門答　鐵路運至　港，山　轉裝於船。最　日產○○噸程　，現已將發電能力一舉增强至四倍程　　發電機裝置完竣，故本年　的預定量○○萬噸，自不必說，從明年度起，當在戰前的年　以上，亦屬確實可靠云。</p>
<p>巴　阿蘭煤礦，自一九二五年時英人拉　爾經營之馬來煤礦公司着手開發以來，約已採出一千萬噸。據說尚有一萬萬噸的埋藏量。其先，在一九二三年時，早有南進日本　先驅者們，向當地日　招集股款，以日本　金與日本礦工之手，試行開發，終因種　事情，歸於失敗，此爲日人　年經營該礦　歷史。</p>
<p>在越南方面，前爲越南政府所封鎖之　班及　那　　二礦區，現已由日法合辦之公司着手開發，脫伊班礦區，亦由日法合辦經營，絡得欽礦區，亦在開發中。</p>
<p>更就煤油來說，如岸商工大臣仕議會中的說明，正是對於南方各地域所　得的油田地方，謀急速而且大規模促　開發之方針。特於婆維州的巴力克巴藩精油工廠，及遜加遜加油田的復興，堪以注目。巴力克巴藩戰前的人口，爲　萬九千，擁有桑波查及遜　遜加大油田，設有巴達亞斐斯煤油公司的精油廠。該廠年產○○○○噸，產額誇爲荷印第一，資本爲一萬萬盾。日軍於本年一月二十四日佔領此處以來，日方當局即努力於該油田及靑由廠的復興。</p>
<p>橡皮資源的將來</p>
<p>現今馬來及蘇門答臘全地的橡皮開　與經營，一切委託昭南橡皮公會辦理。昭南橡皮公會，係由約○○○○的橡皮經營業者組織而成，加入該公會之公司，則有生產公司〇家，辦貨公司○家，合計○○家。大體戰前在南方地　經　橡皮之日人商行，幾全部網　。</p>
<p>今日以前，橡皮　爲爲是生產　剩的代表，然而現今的馬來軍政　，則並未把生產過剩作爲問題，故未想到如何設法調整生產之事，毋寗認爲資源的開發，不能只顧到二年，三年　　前現象，是以若戰前在馬來及蘇門答臘　一百萬噸　橡皮出產，則戰後便臨　生產這　量以上的橡皮之確　的方針。</p>
<p>纖維資源的現勢</p>
<p>纖維資源中最重要的便是棉花，關於棉花的栽培，日本　棉業者早已在菲律賓島　進出了。</p>
<p>現在菲島的棉區，計有如下八區，卽：第一區卡比的州，巴坦加斯州的第一部，面積一·五〇〇；第二區拉格那州，巴坦加斯州的一部，民答那峨島斯他巴特州的一部，面積一·五〇〇，第三區班班格州，巴　安州之一部，面積一·五〇〇，第四區拉鳥尼翁州，脫爾拉克州，班加喜南州，面積一·五〇〇；第五區西耐格羅斯州，馬那布拉巴哥羅特州，面積一·五〇〇；第六區西耐格維斯州，維多利亞·達利　伊地方，民答那峨島斯他巴　州，面積一·五〇〇；第七區西耐格羅斯州，拉卡羅脫地方，面積一·五〇〇；第八區西耐格羅斯州，比那爾巴干地方，面積一·五〇〇。（單位町步——譯。按一町步約等於九九·一二公畝）</p>
<p>並預定於五年間年產五百萬擔的棉在。</p>
<p>在緬甸方面，亦由軍政部指定○家公司爲緬甸之棉花栽培採辦機關，更成立棉花培額增產的五年計畫。</p>
<p>此外，菲島軍政部方面，更發表苧麻及黃麻的增產五年計劃。</p>
<p>苧麻　於民答那峨州裁有二千町步，自昭和十七年（中華民國三十一年）起，計畫於第一年度　大五百町步，合計二千五百町步，俾有九十六萬斤的收穫，次年以後，由於休閑地的利用，馬尼刺麻栽培面積的轉換，森林及具他的開墾等，擬於第二年度擴大三千町步，第三年度擴大四千町步，第四年度擴大五千町步，到了第五年完成合計一萬五千町步以上的苧麻栽培面積，以舉四百萬日斤（約二百四十萬公斤（的收穫爲目標。</p>
<p>其次，黃跡在菲島方面向來沒有栽培，　在則認爲該處地土條件適宜，故已在　答那峨島的達巴奧州及阿格遜州從事栽培了。第一年度（昭和十七年）內，暫爲合計二十町步的小規模試種，因此芷在從事適宜的種子的選擇及移植，預定於第二年度擴大一百町步，第三年度擴大一千町步、第四年度擴大二千町步，到了第五年度元成合計四千町步的黃麻栽培面積，預期由此每年度可有六千一的收穫。</p>
<p>關於馬尼刺麻，苧麻，黃麻等的麻類之指導統制機關，新近已於軍政監部之下，設立了菲島麻類栽培協會。</p>
<p>又黃麻在越南方面，亦已施行栽培了。在越南北部紅河流域東京平野，尤其是河內近郊，已把黃麻作爲特產而在栽培了。河內近郊爲栽培黃麻的適宜之地，專長家已加以證明。</p>
<p>越南當局早在禁止黃麻的輸出，並獎勵栽培，在一九四〇年已擴張原來面積四百六十四公頃，一九四一年擴張九百公頃，本年度更成立了上年之倍即一千八百公頃的栽培計畫。而且決定自台灣輸入優良的種子，同時　聘指導者，從事大規模的栽植。</p>
<p>糖業經營的出發</p>
<p>茲就糖來說，菲島的甘蔗栽培已轉換於棉花栽培，對於當地糖業，已由　地當局與日政府協議結果，於去年八月一日，正式指定六公司爲爪哇糖業的分擔經營者。</p>
<p>爪哇前屬英國系的八十餘所之製糖工廠及糖業地域，由當地當局再行決定如何分擔。又菲島糖業比諸爪哇，其行政及糖業情形不同，故正在計畫依各別方式進行。</p>
<p>更在緬甸方面、軍政監部指定○○，委其經營吞根及雅美欽兩地區之加雅瓦琪工廠。</p>
<p>油脂工業的開發布置</p>
<p>最後，就油脂工業來說，南方椰子油以至椰子乾核的處理，依照日本內地油脂工業的現狀，頗以爲不如把共過剩的物資輸入，在日本內地處理爲妥，但因船隻關係，要輸人大量的椰子油來處理，殊屬不能。又在當地關於美英系的敵產油脂工廠，亦有若干所，將此等工廠管理經營，以圖把油脂製品的自給自足，實爲緊要。故已指定公司擔當經營此等敵產工廠矣。</p>
<p>以上已把南方主要資源的開發情形、概括述之矣。此等開發如　逐步　行，則日本經濟的突飛猛進，是可以期待　。到了那時，日本的經濟，必已完成劃期的變貌了。</p>
<p>然而僅就已在開發的礦物資源來說，縱令是大東亞圈內的全部　則也沒有像普通所想的那樣豐富龐大　尤以日本當前最必要　國　資　爲然。</p>
<p>國　斷不可驕於戰勝而懈其精神，」這是東條首相以及政府當局所一再誥誡的話，必須細思熟考的。（才譯）</p>

<h3>東亞經濟懇談會紀實（十）　譯自三十一年十一月下旬「同盟旬報</h3>
<p>各本部長演講要旨</p>
<p>冷家驥—華北本部長（代理）</p>
<p>大東亞共榮圈立脚于怎樣的經濟基礎上的呢？第一，鑒于世界經濟之解决，以及聯繫經濟之分割的歷史轉換，大東亞應成自給自足經濟圈；第二，以日本爲中心，或者說以日本爲指導者的高度國防經濟圈；第三，一向自由主義，資本主義的原理，全體主義的綜合計割的經濟圈；大東亞共榮圈就非是上述那樣的三種經濟圈不可。但是，爲求確立東亞廣域經濟圈及其自給態勢，首先，各國家非各自樹立其國土計劃不可。這各國的國土計畫，並不是名不相關的單獨計劃，而是應各民族，各國家之特殊性　成的，綜合的國土計劃。我華北，從夾在一般人眼中，只以爲在原始產業和雜，輕工業中才有些計的價值。而目下，非脫出那樣的狹隘的視綫，而試以產業分野之冉劃定不可。再則，關于作爲兵站基地的華北之資源問題，僅將鐵，礬土，岩等資源向日本滿洲輸出，這樣的產業規制，也有予以再檢討之必要。將來希望能利用這些地下資源，而綜合地計劃重工業及化學工業之向華北的分散配置。</p>
<p>宗像久敬—蒙疆本部長</p>
<p>蒙疆民衆，在東亞民族之興隆，以及大東亞共榮圈之建設等理念下，目前無論怎樣地受苦，但爲實現此大理想，能與日本提携邁進，大家都是非常高興的。本年七月，蒙疆在遂行低物價政策之外，又公定了商品價格。通　蒙疆親仁會，父舉行了銅的獻　運動，在八九二月中，民衆的獻納非常踴躍。本年春，農商會父發起貯蓄運動，不到一月，竟到達了七百餘萬元的巨數，蒙疆經濟，和日本，華北，滿洲，朝鮮等，都是關係頗深的，這關係，將來倘愈臻深刻，蒙疆生產一定還能不斷地擴大起來。不論煤或　，不僅對蒙疆自身，要對大東亞經濟整個地予以提供，這才算得是生產擴大呢。</p>
<p>但是，使蒙疆經濟削弱，及孤立的危險有二：一爲由他地域物資流人的梗塞，一爲過度的滙兌限制。這些，希望予以諒解，並對蒙疆滙兌安定，生產增大，及民生安定，予以協力幫助。</p>
<p>陳紹嬀—華中本部長</p>
<p>大東亞新經濟之道，在使各地域物資交流圓滑無阻，因之而使圈內得以自給自足起來。現在因爲交通機關非常短缺之故，輪船等　先得讓給軍需上的調用，一般人就得想法建造帆船來代用。我們可以以五十隻爲一隊，船隊旁邊，設以監視兼護衛船，而母船上面則置有無綫電信機及武器等，這樣，敵人攻擊就無從乘虛而入了。我以爲普遍地建造起這些帆船來，是補救交通呆滯的　一妙法，此事倘能積極推行，對大東亞物資交述，一定是裨益甚大的。</p>
<p>懇談會閉幕</p>
<p>東亞經濟懇談會第三日午後之部，自一時五十分起開會，將左烈聲明予以一致通過後，由小倉會長致閉幕詞，隨即官告散會。亙三日間的大會就此終。</p>
<p>通過聲明</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發一年以來，由於大日本帝國陸海軍之勇戰奮鬥，已將長期間陰謀侵略並榨取東亞的，暴戾的美英勢力，予以澈底淸除，於今大東亞共榮圈建設之基礎，已確立鞏固。然而，美英仍自恃其有強大之生產力，再三不斷嘗試其徒然無效的反攻。因此，爲堅持大東亞戰爭，並確立大東亞共榮圈建設之大業計，將大東亞經濟打成一片，高度地發揮大東亞之綜合經濟力，對戰時生產力之增强作更進一步之努力。凡此，實爲吾等大東亞經濟人不可逃避之責任。以大東亞各地域經濟人爲會員，大東亞經濟建設之促進爲目的，東亞經濟懇談會，於茲開了第四次大會。一方面，向東亞經濟人闡明大東亞經濟建設之根本理想，同時，對大東亞戰爭之狀况，及世界之情勢，詳加分析，在此等埋　及分析下，關於大東亞各地域經濟之進展運營，作了　摯的有建設性的懇談討論。基於此懇談之結果，以實錢爲主旨，望能爲大東亞戰爭之全勝，及大束亞共榮圈建設之完成，協力一致，同甘共苦，作更進一步之努力，則幸甚。（牧譯）</p>

<h3>勸告市民節約消費</h3>
<p>— 盛毓度</p>
<p>需要爲限　力戒囤積</p>
<p>再講到上海的現局，很顯然地可以看到各種物資的供求不平衡，這本來是非常時期的可能現象，自然的趨勢。但是在上海除了自然趨勢以外，因爲種種人爲的關係，更加速了供求的分岐，加深了供求上的不平衡。例如說到食糧，本來是來路不暢，供應有限。但是一般民衆輕信謠言，對於當局對食糧所盡的最大努力，非特不能深切明瞭，並且時常怨天尤人。通常除了購辦逐日必需的消費以外！他們還要儘量地競相儲藏。這樣更將當時的需要，無限制地　高，使供應上的不平衡，格外加深加重，影響所及，更敎平民受苦，社會不安，這眞叫從何說起呢？</p>
<p>我們目前要緩和供應上的不平衡，祇得消極地，相對地設法减低需要；一方面要把神經過敏自私的收藏行爲，趕快放棄了，以免去許多無謂的爭奪；一方面要逐漸减低生活程度，儘量設法利用代替物品。例如：以雜糧，苞米；麵粉代替一部份的食米，間接也便是增加供應了。再拿食米來講，如果我們稍備不時之需，亦是人情之常，切勿競相大量儲藏，結果反是害人而不利於己。再能利用庭園空地，以種雜糧，亦可增加生產。</p>
<p>無職務者自動疏散</p>
<p>此外上海擁有這許多的人口，除去一部份是有必要的職務關係者外，有不少居民，是沒有居住在上海的必要的。那麼，為什么不自動疏散到鄉間故土去呢？一方可以減輕私人生活的負担；一方　也可以減輕整個上海社會的負担了。所以疏散人口，也是幫助解決上海物資供應不平衡的一個有效處置，但是這種事，要由人民本身的覺悟和協助，才能收得實際的功效。上海本是個消費浩大的都市，外來的供應，是那麼的失去把握，才來的困難，是必然地有增無減；縱然是戰事弭　，一時也辦不到物資供　上的平衡。所以醉生夢死，希望過奢，那是自尋煩惱，惟有　衣減食，耐勞　苦，才是應付今後時艱的正當辦法。（續完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從股東大會說起</h3>
<p>— 容觀</p>
<p>有一個朋友，因爲經濟上入不敷出，謀開源之道。聽了同事的勸告，把所有積蓄幾千元，買進了一種股票。</p>
<p>不到一個月，某公司招集股東大會。我的朋友平生沒有做過股東，當然興高彩烈地去出席。</p>
<p>股東大會是下午二時舉行的，到了四時結束。</p>
<p>當天晚上，我的朋友來看我，連連喊：「倒霉！倒霉！做了兩小時的陪客。」</p>
<p>「開股東大會，是股東出風頭的時候，怎麼說是做陪客？」</p>
<p>「你還尋老朋友的開心！如果你去了，一定也要喊倒霉的！」</p>
<p>「正式向你道歉，請你將會議的經過，約略報告一下吧！」</p>
<p>「開會時推舉主席，是預定了的，這且不去管它。所有的議案，也是預定了的；而且討論，贊成，反對，表决，也都跟表演一樣，都是排好了的，出席的股東，雖然有二三百位，但是發言人，不滿十位。他們那一搭一擋的形相。實在使我受不了。最後，我忍不住，站起來發言，請公司當局宣布最近營業方針。那知我還没說完，那包辦會議的幾個傢伙，一致阻撓。我再站起來，想略加聲明；主席　阻止我發言，說時間不早。就用些點心，散會。」</p>
<p>「這眞是豈有此理！」我安慰我的老朋友。</p>
<p>「當時，坐在我旁邊的股東們，說：這會議是少數大股東所辦了的；一二位小股東的意見，他們眞不來理會呢！」</p>
<p>「是喲！老李！小股東發言，本來沒有什麽效力的。就是你的議案僥倖成立，如果於大股東不利，表决起來，也是免不了失敗的。」　　　「不錯，他們的票數多而我們一般小股東彼此不認識，毫無聯絡，瞪着眼睛看他們操縱，包辦，無所不爲！」</p>
<p>老李，你別再嘔氣吧！冠冕堂皇的英美民主政治，那議會開會的情形，還不是跟股東大會差不多嗎？英美的議會裏，發言的機會，還不是被少數代表大資本家的議員壟斷嗎？如果不識相，一定發言，議長竟充耳不聞，置之不答！你今天在股東大會發言，主席還敷衍你幾句，總算是有大面子呢！」</p>
<p>「嗚呼！虚偽的民主政治！」我的朋友和我，不約而同地這麼嘆息地說着。</p>
<h3>印藏邊說（上）</h3>
<p>— 家源</p>
<p>一月五日澳門轉來</p>
<p>從印度到西藏，雖不是捷徑，然而較取道西康經拉薩當爲便利，記者來印度後，印度入藏準備。但由印度入藏，並不如此所想像的簡單。許多朋友都勸我打消此意，並告訴我途中的艱難，不易通過關口，可是這些都不能搖動我去西藏的決心。臨行之前，我曾訪問去過西藏的譚雲山，據他所說當時入藏的情形，正和我現在準備的情形一樣，不但要改扮成藏人的裝束，而且連話，都不能說一句，否則就要被人看出。茲記述此行的印象如次：</p>
<p>北印度之夜</p>
<p>由加爾各答去噶倫堡的火軍，是向正北的一條幹綫，直達的火車每晚僅一次，乘客擁擠，適值英國軍隊的例假，都成羣結隊往大吉嶺遊覽，將所有的車廂完全佔滿。印度鐵路的慣例，只要向站長送點小費，就可找到舒適的鋪位，可是，這時就向站長送錢，也還是没有辦法，幸而遇到一位去大吉嶺的本國朋友，允許我坐在他的鋪上。坐定未久，就遇到戶口警察的檢查，按照印度戶口的法規，凡是離開居住的地區時，應向警廳登記，我爲了减少麻煩起見，並未報告，我只好說是往噶倫保遊覽，他看我的登記表上是隨軍記者，也競沒有為難。</p>
<p>八點半鐘火車開行，我們的車廂裏有五個鋪位，現在却有了七個旅客，二個英國空軍，二個中國商人，和一位久於西藏的程先生，連同記者共四個華人，大家相逢異地，倍加親熱，由於程先生是素悉西藏情形，大家都向他請教，尤其是二位　籍商人，他們的目的是想由西藏運輸貨物到內地，這種打算，在事實上是辦不到的。是夜月圆如鏡，月光從車窗射入，仰首窗外，此印度風光歷歷如在白晝。</p>
<p>西里古里市印象</p>
<p>次晨七時，火車進入西里古里車站，這裏靠近喜馬拉雅山的山脈，加爾各答到此的火車，已是終站。從此另外有二條小鐵路支綫，一條向向茫北往噶倫堡，一條　西往大吉嶺，而往噶倫堡支綫，却不能直達，僅僅通車一半，到幾里古拉爲止。下軍後，記者與程先生合姑汽車一輛，直達噶論堡，三十英里的路程，平時一二十個羅比即可，現在巴漲到三十五個羅比。</p>
<p>八時許，續由西里古出發，約行三英里，即漸次進入山路，愈行愈高，途中略似滇緬公路之起伏，路旁有小火車鐵道　旋而上，森林茂密，風景極佳，每行數英里，即有小村落一所，繼續前行，亦宵如滇緬路上之鐵索橋，惟　　太狹，載重汽車不能通過，至幾里古拉，見有面貌酷肖我國之人，羣集道上，修整路面，其中女性參半，荷重負土一如男性所爲。</p>
<p>南北行，山愈高，汽車行駛於柏油路上，蜿蜒直上，始入平谷下山，過一新落成之水泥大橋，至此有東去公路係新完成者，直達阿散密，此路在軍事上頗有價值。</p>
<p>汽車盤山而上，半山間，架有高架鐵索，以搬運貨物，直到噶倫堡之山頂，山之上下。均置有發電機，軸動鐵索，貨物即有鐵索上之鐵盤升至山上，往復極爲便利，一路而上，均置有標尺高度，登至三干五百公尺時，建作物聳立，屋舍密集，即通藏之要道噶倫堡在焉。</p>
<p>藏印邊境之商人</p>
<p>車抵市口，即與程先生道別，約期再唔，記者仍驅車直上經過市區大道，行兩英里，到達四千英尺高度之際，即印度日報社駐噶倫堡之印務所。此地位於通鍚命（即哲孟雄）首邑剛都之大道，高山屏峙，新式建築之住宅，瞩目皆是。下車後，隨同該社經理李益我，同訪經管西觀貿易之馬家葵，馬氏之住宅，亦臨近大道，建築甚爲寬大，因其依山而築，上下共有五層，室內佈置，爲　　式，大都族塌方墊。出入亦多係藏人，足踏長統烏靴，身穿長袍，髪留長辮，裝束類如清時之古装，爲馬家　　之伙伴。據聞如馬家一樣經營西藏貿易者，僅四五家，最著者爲藏人自營之邦大昌，及洪盛，　記，鑄記等號。除此而外，其他外來商　，均不能直接前往西藏貿易。</p>
<p>馬家爲滇湞籍勝　縣人，最初爲其父馬主　所主持，現因馬氏回籍，由其子馬家葵自理，所運辦之貨物，聞係由拉薩經西康而入麗江，每次起運，約三月之久，始能到達。</p>
<p>馬家葵爲三十友右之青年，見面后，彼略現難色，惟礦於翟社長之情面，祗云暫爲等待，俟有相當機會及妥當伴人時，再隨時通知，並稱此事極感爲難，如伴當不得其人，往往會因此出事，倘如一經出事，記者受害尚淺，而彼之連累甚大，甚至因此即不能作西藏之貿易。</p>
<p>噶倫堡的輪廓</p>
<p>由馬家辭出，走入市上，來往行人，藏人極多，風俗習慣亦多藏化，每家門前咸置有若干旗竿，而下而上掛一直幅長族，據云旗上均印有佛經，風吹動時，經旗飄動、猶如人日背誦一樣，因此凡有藏人居住之處，正在都是。</p>
<p>印度人决此並不多見，僅少數的大商戶爲印人經管，噶倫堡原屬哲孟雄，爲西藏的屬邦。市中尼泊爾，不丹土人甚多，人種類似我國人民，惟服裝奇異，女人咸着長裙，男人大都着不三不四之西装，但頭上所戴小帽，則類似中國瓜皮帽，帽頂亦爲紅色，推帽邊綉有花紋。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>有時他取下咪吉爾（Virgil）諾芬（Zenophon）的作品來讀上幾分鐘，不過不久他又回到桑代克（Thorndyke）醫師或法倫許（French）檢察官的作品了。雖然他多年來孜孜不倦地教授着，他到底不是一個淵博古典學者：的確，他想拉丁語與希臘語，比了活大所說的話還要重要，牠們雖然是死的話，而英國的紳士是應該知道一些牠們的成語的。他喜歡「泰晤士」（Thems）報上那些短評，牠們會　用一些他所熟知的句子。懂得這些事情的人在逐漸减少去了，他還能够在這些人中佔一地位，在他看來是一種秘密的並且有價值的義氣相投：他覺得；這就是古典教育所貢獻的各種主要利益之一。</p>
<p>他就這樣住在威葛特夫人的屋子，安靜地享受者閱讀，談天和懷念這些快樂；他是老人了，頭髮白了，並且有一些禿了，却不管他的年齡如何，仍舊很活動，暍着茶，接待着賓客，忙着修改「勃洛克菲爾德一覽」，以備下次的出版，用　細如蛛絲一般。而很清楚的字體，寫着難得寫的信札。他請新的教師及學生來喝茶。這一個秋季學期，新的教師有兩位，他們探訪他之後，在走出來的時候，其中一個批評着說：「這老孩子很可以算得一個人物，是不是？如果說孤身漢的確是有的，他那種大驚小怪地忙着弄茶的樣子，就是一個道地的孤身漢。」</p>
<p>這種批評在事實上却大錯特錯了；因爲吉普斯完全不是一，個孤身漢，他會結過婚，雖然時間已很長久，勃洛克菲爾德的教職員誰也記不起他的妻子了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>火是那樣地温暖，茶是那樣的芳香，他受到了刺激，前　往事，就麗麗在心頭出現了。春天—一天九六年的春天。他四十八歲—這是永久習慣開始要給人看出来的年齡。他剛剛被委派爲舍監；他一面担任着這個職務，一面教授着古典的功課，他給自己造成了一個温暖而繁忙的生活。在暑假裏，他和同事勞頓（Rowden）到湖區（Lake　District）；他們散散步，爬爬山，玩了一個星期，勞頓爲了家事就離開了。吉普斯獨启住在華斯台爾海德（Wasdale　Head），在一個小小的農舍裏寄着飯。（八）</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>社會服務處感言</h3>
<p>— 七五老人趙希明</p>
<p>社會服務，是人類的義舉，是全民族的義務，希明極表同情甘作先鋒。雖非識途老馬謹備燕台市駿。老縱老矣，不甘後人，社會服務，助人人助希明是失敗耆年會的創始人是嶄新耆老會的發起人，今以老爲首，病　孤，貧隸於老人所治理的三大部，歸耆老負責，經營而拓殖之，福利萬分。如　泯除宗教意見，　聯合人類互共，　劃分各級制度，　設立教養導師。</p>
<p>孔云老安少懷；佛說生，老，病，死；耶愛小孩　以父母待老年。可知宗教家的眼光，老少平等，長幼咸宜。人但注重少小幼稚之童年，多妄　齡壯志之耆老。如馬相伯，如與登堡，老當富益。今消彌宗教之派別，昌我人之一體合人類爲一羣，求社會之平齊。</p>
<p>人生秉賦不同，性情各異，好善求生之願望，大都由同，尤以老年人，擠出社會爲可惜。老年人之資財學術，今姑不計，就其閱歷經騐，仍有一部份特長、輔翊人羣，奈何以財位論資格，以成敗取人才。若姜尚，梁灝之齡，竟委溝壑，可惜孰甚，尤以老年人甘於自棄自放，自居隱沒以鳴高，最爲可惜。</p>
<p>人生痛苦，約分四部，究孔佛之言，以老爲首，率領病，孤，貧三部份弱者，同入康莊，病夫，孤兒，貧士，都有互助之必需，若言老的士紳，有助人之心力者　不乏人，若陳　　年八十七，沈恩孚年八十，高凰池年八十，徐乾老，丁福保，聞蘭亭等之心存濟世，力任扶危，如能締結一「耆年會」，仿青年會之規範，服務社會，若是則社會人羣中，老年人有耆年會團契，壯年人有青年會合羣，雙方並進，老少同歸。正如雙輪車，兩翼鳥，沖　直上，萬里鵬程，又何難焉？願力赴之！</p>
<p>有人，有土，有財之訓，生聚，食寡，致富之源·不患寡，患不均，吾社會之貧，爭利者多，生利者少，無米之炊，巧婦難爲。今欲救社會，福人羣，必須教養兼施，食力雙足，方是根本救法。以工代賑，救荒善政；以教爲，救貧上策，教廉，教儉，教藝，欲飽口腹，先勤手足，手足果勤，生產必豐，不是坐吃山空，不比不勞而獲。救生產之導師者，又賴乎老農，老圃，宿學之老儒。老人者，非棄材也。正可利用老年人，沽哉！沽哉！我待義賣而售，脫穎現鋒也</p>
<p>今上數言，爲感動應聲之初步，更願獻我餘年，王成這社會服務的大業。請求救濟：貧病，健康，職業，讀書，講學，老安，少懷八數。</p>
<h3>天光小學　招收免費生</h3>
<p>南市陸家浜警察局對面，天光義務小學，教管嚴格，校舍寬大，師資優良，學費免牧，全日上課。今爲普及造就，再設一年五年各一班，招收新生，及各級插班生。</p>
<h3>中華慈幼協會　分發貧兒寒衣</h3>
<p>中華慈幼協會收到貧見寒衣捐款，已達八萬餘元，各界救護兒童之熱忱，可見一斑。第一批寒衣巳製竣，每套價值爲三十元。現因連日天氣嚴寒，一般貧童童請發給寒衣，經准許後，由家長陸續至該會領取，頗爲踴躍。該會爲普遍分發寒衣起見，除委託五旬節聖潔會派員前往虹口韜朋路南市小南門喬家路，浜北文監師路，法租界許家弄，及赫德路等貧民區域，調查赤貧兒童，定期發給外，並函請全市各教堂協助調查需要寒衣之隱貧兒童，造具名冊，由該會統籌分發。</p>
<p>招領　同孚路廿路無執電車站上拾得鑰匙一串，失主至巨籟達路福潤里五號許樂公認取。</p>

<h3>Establishing Wartime Economic Policies</h3>
<p>We discussed the general principles of a wartime political system yesterday. We believe that only with enlightened politics and a reformed atmosphere, only when public opinion can be adopted by the government, can national policies be thoroughly implemented. However, we must not neglect the economy at the same time. Because the economy is the foundation of politics, if economic policies are unsound, then "there has never been a case of a nation being rich while its people are poor." Therefore, the determination of wartime economic policies is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>However, the economic policy of a country, whether in wartime or peacetime, especially in wartime, must thoroughly understand the economic characteristics of the country and formulate a "prescriptive" strategy; otherwise, it will only cause suffering to the people and become an empty formality. What are the characteristics of the current Chinese economy?</p>
<p>Since the start of the China Incident, an economic panic has emerged across China's vast territory. Rural areas have gone bankrupt, and urban industries have withered or stagnated. The national economy has suffered unprecedented destruction. Labor, raw materials, transportation, and the purchasing power of the general public are all far from what they used to be.</p>
<p>The development of production has also been severely hampered. Therefore, current wartime economic policies must not simply copy those of other countries. China's wartime economic policies are built on the foundation of the dire state of people's livelihoods in the five or six years after the war. Therefore, its characteristics should not be merely the implementation of control and allocation systems, but should also have the positive meaning of encouraging and supporting production.</p>
<p>However, relying solely on this principle of economic policy is not enough. On the one hand, we need to have a more thorough understanding of the Chinese economy, and on the other hand, we need to consider the greater future of the nation and carefully establish economic policies. Although these are wartime policies, they must also consider the recovery and development of the economy after the war.</p>
<p>Under this premise, we must first recognize that the biggest reason why China's economy could not develop in the past was the invisible constraints imposed by British and American forces. Although British and American forces have now been eliminated, the spirit and system of British and American economics in China still exist. Secondly, we must know that the economic policies of the past, especially the economic policies of the Chongqing regime, were very chaotic. They did not consider the interests of the entire nation, nor did they consider the long-term plans of the nation, but simply followed the capitalist system of Britain and the United States, serving British and American capitalists, and neglecting the development of the entire national economy. In many ways, they even hindered the development of the national economy. Thirdly, the economic structure of China is dominated by small and medium-sized producers, with small-scale commodity production accounting for a very large proportion. This is true of rural production and handicraft production, and how much different is it for modern industry? If we do not correct these characteristics of the Chinese economy and copy the economic policies of other countries, the result will only increase the suffering of the people and the national economy. Fourthly, we must not shy away from saying that in the process of this Greater East Asia War, in order for China and Japan to truly cooperate and strive for victory, our country's economic policies must maintain close ties with Japan, especially in terms of materials and labor. China must fulfill its due obligations; otherwise, what is the point of participating in the war? However, at the same time, we should remind the Chinese and Japanese authorities and economic circles that the co-existence and co-prosperity of China and Japan that we advocate and aspire to are not only for today's wartime cooperation, but also have a greater future, which is the eternal cooperation in the long years after the war. Therefore, today's economic policies must not only meet the temporary needs of the Greater East Asia War, but also be planned on a larger scale, planned for peaceful cooperation between the two countries after the war. Only by putting the Chinese economy on the right track of rational development, and enabling the balanced and rational development of agriculture and industry in China, will it benefit the Chinese nation and may even provide greater assistance to the Japanese wartime economy.</p>
<p>After the basic premise and tasks are determined, we feel that the following more specific points should be noted regarding the content of the economy:</p>
<p>First, in terms of enterprises, in addition to actively building state-owned enterprises, we must protect and support the development of private capital. China's industry is very pitiful. Under these circumstances, we should increase production, not passively restrict it. The role of developing state-owned enterprises is to solve the needs of some materials and promote the development of private enterprises. It should never monopolize and compete with the people for profit. For private enterprises, we must subsidize large-scale enterprises, but at the same time, we must not neglect small and medium-sized production. Here, cooperative enterprises must be earnestly promoted.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of production relations, in industry, we must improve labor-management relations and improve the treatment of workers. In agriculture, we must also solve the tenancy relationship fairly and reasonably. Whether for industry or agriculture, for operators and industrial and agricultural workers, we must try our best to avoid causing resentment, reduce their burden and inconvenience as much as possible, actively protect their legitimate interests, and try to help them develop production.</p>
<p>Third, in finance and taxation, we must strictly prohibit banks and money shops from speculating on commodities, guide idle funds into productive enterprises, and use all reasonable methods to reduce the degree of currency inflation. We must also strive to innovate and improve in terms of tax system and public debt.</p>
<p>In addition, we should improve transportation, increase transportation tools, resolutely eradicate hoarding and speculation, and support the business of small and medium-sized merchants; especially in the peaceful areas, improve the inspection system, carefully select, train and assess inspection personnel, pay special attention to the punishment of major offenders, and do not make excessive difficulties for ordinary small merchants and civilians.</p>
<p>The most important points we have seen and thought about are the above. However, when it comes to the wartime economy, it still depends on the improvement of politics. Only good politics, especially good and honest political cadres at all levels, can guarantee the healthy development of the wartime economy. We sincerely hope that all parties will pay attention to this, so as to comfort the expectations of our people.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) After the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, people in the capital generally believed that at this critical stage of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government resolutely made a decisive decision to fully cooperate with Japan in military, political, and economic affairs.

It is expected that the National Government will further strengthen security and increase production in the future, in order to enhance the national foundation and cooperate in the war. It will also take a heroic stance in defending East Asia and restoring China, and will not hesitate to wage a difficult struggle against Britain and the United States.

<h3>Japanese Army in China, General Commander Hata's Speech: China and Japan Should Trust and Help Each Other to Strive to Complete the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) Japanese Army in China, General Commander Hata, upon learning of the National Government's declaration of war, recently issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Japan had previously resolved to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia and to ensure the permanent stability of Greater East Asia, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It has now been a year, and thanks to the strategic planning and bravery of the Japanese soldiers and the full mobilization of the rear by the people, unprecedented major victories have been achieved, key areas in the South have been occupied, and an invincible situation has been established. During this period, the National Government has been sharing weal and woe and fully cooperating with Japan's operations. This time, it has further resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, which is not only for the construction of a New China, but also for the construction of a New East Asia, and is truly commendable. Now that China and Japan have issued a joint declaration and are conducting a joint war under full cooperation, the military cooperation between the two countries has been further strengthened due to China's participation in the war. That is, the troops of the two countries will develop the friendship of comrades-in-arms under strong unity, undergo full training, and wage a just war against the common enemy with the belief in certain victory, and will inevitably achieve final victory. At this time, it is regrettable that the Chongqing faction still does not distinguish between obedience and defiance, does not observe the world's general trends, and is willing to be a pawn of the public enemies of the East Asian nations, Britain and the United States, and is still engaged in resistance. If the Chongqing faction bears the stigma of being a rebel against East Asia and hinders the sacred cause, the Japanese Army in China will never tolerate it and will only annihilate it. Today, let us calmly consider the situation in East Asia. It has been five and a half years since the outbreak of the China Incident. During this period, there have been twists and turns, but it has made the relationship between China and Japan return to its original state. Moreover, due to this participation in the war, the rise and fall of China and Japan are shared. The one-year history of the Greater East Asia War has eliminated the anti-force in the vast area of East Asia, and all construction is gradually progressing and will reap the fruits of co-prosperity. East Asia is now approaching the dawn of a new era. Generally speaking, in the second year, the enemy is still attempting to resist desperately, and there are still many difficulties ahead of us. However, China and Japan should trust each other, help each other, work hard, and strive to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>The Liberation of East Asia Can Be Declared Successful</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) General Hayashi Senjuro, President of the Japan Asian Co-operation Society, was extremely pleased upon learning that the Chinese government had announced its participation in the war. He specially stated, "China's declaration of participation in the war is not only deeply gratifying to the people of both countries, but also to the 1 billion people of East Asia. The phrase 'sharing life and death' put forward by Chairman Wang has been realized, and the liberation and prosperity of East Asia will inevitably be declared successful as a result."</p>
<h3>Jing New Movement Branch Level Practice Group</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) The Beijing New Citizens Movement Branch is currently actively organizing a New Movement Practice Group, which will be headed by Zhou Xuechang, Director of the New Movement Branch, and will consist of 30 to 100 staff members selected from various bureaus, offices, and associations of the municipal government who have pure thoughts, healthy bodies and minds, and work diligently.

<h3>Suhuai Counties Decide to Implement Military National Education, People's Representatives Hold a Conference in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) The Suhuai counties recently decided to implement military national education starting in 1943. Primary school students will be given scout training, and middle school students will be given military training to prepare for the war system.</p>

<h3>Talks by the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Suqing Township Party Affairs Office</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) After the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States reached the provincial capital, Director Li and Deputy Director Yuan of the Qingxiang District Party Affairs Office made special remarks, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Director Li said, "The history of China in the past century has been almost entirely a history of lingering under the iron heels of British and American imperialism. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the warlords have fought each other within the country, and politics has been unable to develop. In fact, this is all due to the instigation of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the main condition of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the founding father was to eradicate the forces of Britain and the United States. We still remember that in 1922, when the founding father extracted Guangzhou customs duties, Britain and the United States directly loaded their seventeen warships into Guangzhou. This is enough to prove the collusion with domestic corrupt forces. Today, in order to implement the unfinished will of the Chinese revolution, we must further recognize the causes and effects of the East Asian Incident in recent years and vow to use the solidarity of the yellow race to create an iron wall to protect East Asia. In the past, when the Chinese declared war on Europeans and Americans, it was isolated, so it was not victorious, but this time the situation is completely different. There are not only strong allies fighting side by side, but also foreign groups that oppose Britain and the United States fighting together. I dare to guarantee that victory belongs to us." Deputy Director Yuan said, "History tells us that responding to each other is the primitive philosophy of mutual survival for mankind. The world of East Asia is the world of East Asians. If we want to maintain the inherent base of East Asia, China and Japan must strive for future survival through mutual understanding. The Chongqing faction does not hesitate to fight among themselves and is anesthetized by the distorted approach of close attack and distant diplomacy, which not only violates the duties given by history, but also deviates from the great nature inherent in mankind. From the perspective of the development of international forms, the snipe and the clam fighting each other will eventually lead to the destruction of the snipe and the clam themselves. Today, our opposition to Britain and the United States is entirely based on the world of the entire East Asian people. All Chinese people should, under the leadership of the highest leader, understand the times and the situation in East Asia, and use this determination to welcome the miracle of human rationality. China's declaration of war on Britain and the United States this time relies on the guidance of wise leaders and the cooperation of the entire nation. We dare to guarantee that victory belongs to us."</p>
<h3>All Qingxiang Personnel Support the National Government's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: People in East Asia have long been resentful of the aggression of the white race. During the Greater East Asia War, they have slightly relieved their resentment, but the evil forces have not been completely eliminated, and it is difficult for us to rest easy. Now, in order to eliminate the remaining evil and rebuild, our National Government resolutely issued a clear order to participate in the war, to eliminate those ugly kinds and lay the foundation for our country. We will share the same hatred and jointly launch a righteous crusade. Therefore, when the National Government's telegram on participation in the war arrived in Zhejiang, all the people in Zhejiang were enthusiastically excited. Every civilian had great hopes. The Qingxiang Office and agencies at all levels intensified their work. Chief Chuan sent a telegram to the Chairman in the morning of the 10th to pay his respects and sincerely support him. The original telegram read: "To Chairman Wang of the Nanjing National Government: I read the Qing telegram and admire your spirit of sharing the same hatred and fighting the enemy, winning glory for China and building a bastion for East Asia. Everyone with blood and energy follows. In recent days, the people in the Qingxiang area have been listening and are extremely excited. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered without prior arrangement. They all vowed to share the spirit of weal and woe and fight for life and death, to eliminate the Allies and strengthen our axis. Shishuo respectfully leads 1.5 million people in the Qingxiang area to intensify their work, sleep with spears as pillows, wait for orders, and serve as vanguards. Respectfully telegraphing our respects, I respectfully request your consideration. Chuan Shishuo, Chief of the Zhejiang Office of the Qingxiang Committee, leads all Qingxiang staff in bowing."</p>
<h3>The People Increase Their Work and Prepare to Hold Large Meetings</h3>
<p>Since Jiaxing has been handling Qingxiang affairs, important military, political, and party affairs figures have been frequent visitors, and talents have gathered. After the National Government announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States on the 9th, all sectors of society from Qingxiang to He were extremely excited. A warm people's congress was held that afternoon. Yesterday was the second day after the National Government's declaration of war, and the emotions among the people were even more tense. The industrial and commercial sectors raised the national flag high, and slogans with clear and eye-catching characters were everywhere in the streets and alleys, supporting the National Government's participation in the war, wishing the Greater East Asia War victory, and so on, were vividly written on paper. The people were even more confident in victory, and a sense of shared hatred and determination to fight the enemy was fully revealed in their words. All military and political agencies increased their work after the National Government officially announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States, gradually showing the state of the country's declaration of war on foreign countries. As for the various special zones, except for Liangjia in He and Haining near Jiaxing, all sectors in Haiyan, Pinghu, and Songnan only received the news of the declaration of war on the morning of the 10th. In an instant, thanks to the power of newspapers, many people in the remote areas of the special zones were able to see the news of the participation in the war. At present, all localities are launching people's congresses to take the same steps as the government to express their anti-British and anti-American sentiments.</p>
<h3>Yu's Supreme National Defense Council Convenes an Emergency Meeting, Feeling Deeply Uneasy About Future Developments, Britain Pays Close Attention to the Future of the East Asian War Situation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) According to reliable sources, after the news of the National Government's participation in the war reached Chongqing, all parts of the Yu area were greatly agitated. The Yu Supreme National Defense Council immediately convened an emergency meeting of its leaders at 2 p.m. on the 9th to discuss countermeasures. It then held a meeting with the British and American ambassadors and military representatives stationed in Yu to negotiate, and the situation was quite anxious. Intellectuals in general were even more worried and uneasy, and there was a possibility of major turmoil as a result.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) The news of the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States was broadcast throughout Europe via China and Japan that day. Political circles in various countries were extremely agitated by this. According to a telegram from London, the British side seemed quite calm on the surface regarding the National Government's participation in the war, but it seemed to be paying more attention to the future and impact of the Greater East Asia War situation. Well-informed sources in London predicted that the British side could only make shameless propaganda again, such as saying that the National Government's participation in the war would not bring about major changes in the Japanese military, etc., and believed that the National Government's participation in the war this time could actually express its determination to annihilate the Yu faction, and was quite worried that the pressure on the Yu faction would increase. In addition, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American governments, although most of their concessions in China had been lost, still issued a statement to Yu last autumn, abolishing extraterritoriality to show their favor to the Yu faction. However, the specific methods are still under negotiation. On the other hand, in the China-Japan agreement issued by the National Government at the time of its participation in the war, the Japanese government stated that it would return most of the Japanese-controlled concessions in China, making the empty gestures of Britain and the United States completely ineffective. It is reported that the British authorities are quite embarrassed and uneasy about the status of British and American residents in the concessions in the peaceful areas of China, believing that changes will occur. According to news from Chongqing, the Yu faction is feigning calmness on the surface regarding the National Government's participation in the war, but is deeply suspicious and uneasy about how the Japanese army and the National Government will fully cooperate and launch new operations against the Yu faction in the future.</p>
<h3>The Propaganda Department Holds Two Lecture Meetings Separately</h3>

<h3>After the National Government Declared War, East Asia Has Become United, Britain and the United States Suffer Severe Blows, Germany and Italy Express Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry authorities, on the 9th, expressed their views on the National Government's declaration of war and Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions in China, stating that the resolute declaration of war against Britain and the United States by the Chinese National Government demonstrates its firm belief in the victory of the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy in this war. More importantly, China has a population unparalleled in the world. The participation of the National Government, with its hundreds of millions of people, in the Axis war front to fight against Britain and the United States is a considerable force. As a result, China and Japan can form a common front. Furthermore, Japan's abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions in the territory of the National Government are particularly important. Britain and the United States have been negotiating with Chongqing for years to abolish extraterritoriality. Japan's voluntary abandonment of extraterritoriality in China proves Japan's sincere and friendly attitude toward the National Government. The equality of rights between China and Japan is also established here. At the same time, the propaganda made by Britain and the United States that Japan is oppressing China is completely shattered. We sincerely welcome the Chinese people under the National Government rising up to participate in the Axis countries' war against Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to political figures here, after the Chinese National Government declared war, the 250 million Chinese people also stand on the front line against Britain and the United States. The significance of this is self-evident. German newspapers are competing to publish this news and the statements made by China and Japan on this development. People in Berlin continue to say that this move is particularly fortunate because it has caused Roosevelt to suffer another misfortune. The backlash caused by the white paper he issued was weak and he was criticized by Congress, exposing his embarrassment. Now he has suffered another major blow.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Public opinion in Berlin believes that the Chinese National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is sufficient to demonstrate its confidence in the final victory of the Tripartite Pact countries. German newspapers have published the communiqués issued by Nanjing and Tokyo on the front page, unanimously praising them. The "German General Review" commented: "From now on, the entire East Asia is now united to jointly deal with the financial groups of Britain and the United States, giving a major blow to the exploitation schemes of Britain and the United States, and restoring China's complete sovereignty." "Strong War" commented: "China's declaration of war is a major blow to Roosevelt and Churchill. From now on, Britain and the United States will add another heavy burden, and it also proves that the construction of the new order in East Asia has now entered the stage of implementation. Britain and the United States have completely lost the opportunity to recover their lost territories." The "Berlin Local Daily" commented: "The Chinese National Government's adoption of this step is the success of the new world order."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial stating that China's participation in the war is a further step in implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. China and Japan have now formed a unified entity in military, political, and economic aspects. The relationship between Nanjing and Germany, Italy, Thailand, and other countries has become even closer. Now that Japan has abandoned its concessions and consular jurisdiction in China, Chongqing has no excuse.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) – Italian public opinion is expressing warm welcome to the National Government's resolute declaration of war against Britain and the United States. According to Stefani News Agency on the 9th, the National Government's participation in the war has further increased the strength of the Greater East Asia War to liberate East Asia, and its influence on the Axis camp is extremely important and great. This is the common feeling of all Italian people. Furthermore, Japan's voluntary abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions are not to be compared with the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing. The Italian people firmly believe that with the sincere cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved, and the great cause of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed.</p>
<p>Madrid, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Spanish newspapers attach great importance to China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, recognizing it as an indication of actively fighting alongside Japan. When publishing the news, the newspapers placed the Chairman's photograph in a prominent position on the front page.</p>
<h3>Talk by Commander Yoshida of the Japanese Fleet Stationed in China: China and Japan Have Already Cooperated as One, Hoping to Devote All Efforts to Completing the War</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai – Commander Yoshida Zengo of the Japanese fleet stationed in China recently issued a statement regarding our country's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, stating that with the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese joint declaration on cooperating to complete the war, China and Japan have now become one in name and in fact, cooperating as one to bravely advance towards the goal of completing the holy war. The rise and fall of Greater East Asia can be expected, and I am sincerely overjoyed. Recalling that since the return to the capital, China and Japan have shared weal and woe in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and have consistently and strongly assisted the Empire in promoting national policy. Therefore, this participation in the war has further established the wartime system in the country, mobilizing the total strength of materials and minds, and demonstrating the enthusiasm of Chinese officials and people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, relying on Japan's strategic planning and brave fighting, unprecedented great war results have been achieved, and we continue to advance towards the final victory with unwavering determination. At this moment, Sino-Japanese relations have suddenly revealed new developments, which can be said to further enhance the war strength of our camp, and make the political and military strategies of certain victory and invincibility that have already been established even stronger. This goes without saying for Britain and the United States. Especially for Chongqing, due to the clear attitude of China and Japan, it has already lost the name of resisting Japan and the hope of war victories. I deeply believe that its influence is very great. The Imperial government has taken various measures on this occasion to strengthen the political power of the National Government and increase the welfare of the Chinese people, which has been announced in detail the other day. This is nothing more than to expect the development of our friendly ally China and the enthusiasm of their sincere cooperation. The Navy stationed in China is determined to strive for its realization, and hopes that Chinese officials and people should also consistently implement the true meaning of this participation in the war. China and Japan should cooperate, jointly devote all their efforts, and complete the war. At the same time, Japanese residents in China should also adapt to this new situation, fully understand the Empire's measures, and sincerely strive to promote national policy.</p>
<h3>Konoe's Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Former Prime Minister Prince Konoe gave a statement at his private residence in Ogikubo on the morning of the 10th regarding the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality. The main points are as follows: There is no other way to complete the construction of China except to drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia and seek the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is the natural outcome of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Therefore, the National Government's participation in the war this time is nothing more than the realization of this doctrine. I have heard that some people within Chongqing are also deeply reflecting on the future of the entire East Asia situation after Japan's failure. Some people believe that China's position at this time is by no means favorable. In fact, apart from Chiang Kai-shek and the Song family, who are heavily intoxicated by the United States, the rest of the thoughtful people will gradually tend towards this intention. Moreover, some quite influential people in Chongqing are also quite indignant at the United States arbitrarily showing off its planes and weapons in Chinese territory. This is also a matter of course, because China's autonomy and independence can only be obtained in Dr. Sun's doctrine. This point should also be well known to the Chinese people. In short, China's participation in the war and the Empire's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality, from China's perspective, is the development of Pan-Asianism, and from our country's perspective, it can be said to originate from the spirit of the declaration of war.</p>
<h3>Minister Kofu's Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Minister Kofu of the Japanese Embassy's Information Department recently issued a statement as follows: After the conclusion of this Sino-Japanese agreement, China has restored the sovereignty it lost before the Opium War and achieved complete independence. Any government in China in the past could not have achieved this, but now it has been achieved by the National Government. This is truly a landmark great contribution in Chinese history and a great success for the National Government. According to foreign dispatches, the National Government's declaration of war this time has given the United States and Britain a great shock. The United States and Britain are currently considering countermeasures. However, in my imagination, due to the establishment of this new Sino-Japanese agreement, the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen, and the Beijing legation area, which China has restored, Britain and the United States once declared that they would return them to Chongqing. Originally, Britain and the United States always carried out the so-called justice and humanity in the name of concessions and extraterritorial rights that did not harm themselves, and exaggerated their propaganda as their consistent deceptive means. In fact, the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen and the Beijing legation area are all under Japanese influence, so Britain and the United States do not feel any pain even if they declare that they will return them to Chongqing. They are entirely implementing their traditional policy of deceiving the Chinese people. This only deepens the Chinese people's contempt for Britain and the United States and reduces their confidence in relying on Chongqing.</p>
<h3>A Letter from Gandhi: The United States Cannot Shirk Responsibility for Britain's Actions in India (Relayed from Macau on January 6)</h3>
<p>The monthly magazine "India Today," founded by the American India Alliance, recently revealed a letter from Gandhi to the United States, stating: Since the United States is an ally of Britain, it cannot shirk its responsibility for Britain's actions in India. If I did not recognize that Britain, as an allied nation, has the necessary courage to shoulder the responsibility of liberating India from its shackles, then I would demand that the United States come forward and ask Britain to withdraw its rule in India. If Britain can fulfill this highest act of justice, then Britain can eliminate all the causes of Indian dissatisfaction. I acknowledge that the value of this move is even greater than all the battleships and aircraft that the great resources of the United States can produce. Since the United States holds the same principles as Britain, the United States cannot shirk its responsibility for what British representatives do in India. Shouldn't we also demand unconditional recognition of Indian independence? Some say that today is not the time, but we deeply feel that today is the most appropriate time in terms of psychology. I hope that the United States understands that immediately recognizing India is the most important and greatest war measure.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Are Extremely Inspired, Resolving to Cooperate in Liberating East Asia</h3>
<p>Thailand</p>
<p>Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the news of the National Government's announcement of cooperation with Japan to jointly fight against Britain and the United States spread, the 2.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand were extremely inspired. Chen Shouming, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement expressing his determination to support the National Government's position, stating that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the overseas Chinese deeply understood the significance of this operation. After reading the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, the common enemies of East Asia, we feel deeply grateful and deeply feel the importance of our responsibilities in the future. We vow to cooperate with all our strength under the leadership of the National Government to complete this East Asia liberation war.</p>
<p>Vietnam</p>
<p>Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – More than 300,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam were extremely excited after learning that the National Government had declared war against Britain and the United States. Each household hung the national flag. The local Chinese newspaper "New East Asia" also published the declaration of war. A general assembly of overseas Chinese was held in the afternoon in the city of Saigon, where the declaration of war was read and it was unanimously resolved to support the National Government and thoroughly defeat enemy countries such as Britain and the United States. A telegram was also sent to Chairman Wang to pay respects.</p>
<p>Malaysia</p>
<p>Johor Bahru, 10th (Central News Agency) – Lin Wenxi, president of the Malayan Peninsula Chinese Association, yesterday issued a statement on behalf of the 1.5 million overseas Chinese in Malaya on the matter of the motherland's participation in the war, stating that our country's declaration of war this time is a necessary measure. Under the leadership of the National Government and the protection of the Japanese army, we can clearly see the path we should take after the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Therefore, we deeply feel that the responsibility of being loyal to the motherland is extremely important. In the future, we should support the motherland in all aspects with financial, material, and human resources, cooperate in carrying out the war, and achieve the ultimate goal of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.</p>
<p>Philippines</p>
<p>Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the National Government resolutely declared war against Britain and the United States in the spirit of living and dying together with Japan, more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines firmly believe that the revitalization of China and the liberation of East Asia can be realized as a result. Wang Tianshen, director of the All-Philippines Chinese Association, told reporters yesterday that the National Government's move was what we had been hoping for. Japan is fighting for East Asia for East Asians, and the motherland is cooperating with all its strength in the spirit of living and dying together. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines are filled with excitement and vow to support the national policy of the motherland and contribute all their strength to this great war.</p>
<h3>Rumor That the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Will Again Go to Washington to Consult with the US President to Revise the North African War Plan</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 9th (Havas) – According to news from London and Washington, people in Britain and the United States are expressing dissatisfaction with the North African war, which is becoming more and more blatant. A British semi-official source confirmed yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill will travel to the United States in the shortest possible time to discuss the current situation with President Roosevelt. Foreign Secretary Eden may accompany him at that time. Military figures in Britain believe that the war plans agreed upon by the British and American staff last year must be completely revised due to the failure of the North African war. Therefore, the nature of the upcoming Washington conference is very important. Moreover, the Soviet Union is now openly expressing dissatisfaction. The landing of the British and American allied forces in North Africa failed to force the German side to transfer a single soldier from the Eastern Front. Even the German air force was not transferred, which is completely contrary to what the Soviet Union expected. As for the North African war situation, what can be said is as follows: (1) The British and American authorities have no connection in politics, and lack cooperation in military affairs. (2) The military development is extremely slow. The British and American allied forces have landed in North Africa for two months, but their elite troops have not yet been transferred to the African front line, which is difficult to understand. Although London newspapers reveal the situation of American military equipment production, based on the situation of the war in Tunisia and the fact that the United States only has 100 aircraft there, it can be seen that the various claims of the United States have not been confirmed. (3) The Allied powers rely on French secessionists in politics, but there are differences of opinion within the faction, so their support for the Allied powers is of no practical benefit. (4) The US government supports the Giraud faction in North Africa, which only results in North Africa maintaining an "anti-democratic political system."</p>
<h3>US Admiral Stark Issues a Statement Saying That the War Will Be Difficult to End for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Havas) – According to news from Washington, US European Fleet Commander Admiral Stark, after returning to Washington today, told the press, "The current European war is bound to be protracted. To say that it will end soon is either a deliberate lie or wishful thinking." The reason for his return home is not convenient to explain. The main task of the US European Fleet is to protect the safety of transportation between Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>South African Colonel Reitz Goes to Britain to Take Office</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from London, Colonel Reitz of the South African Union government has arrived in London to take up the post of member of the South African Supreme Committee.</p>
<h3>MacWhorter's Inspection Trip: Returns to Australia After Completing Official Duties</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The US official officially announced that General MacWhorter, who had previously inspected New Guinea, has now returned to the Australian headquarters.</p>
<h3>Contradictions Between Chongqing and the US: Xiong Shihui Suffers Cold Shoulders, Lin Yutang Scoffs and Ridicules</h3>
<p>(Domei News Agency, Lisbon, 1st) A dispatch from New York stated that Lin Yutang, a Chinese critic famous for his propaganda for Chongqing's war of attrition, issued a statement in New York on the 1st, expressing indignation at the United States' cold treatment of the delegation sent to the United States by the Jiang regime led by Xiong Shihui, which ultimately resulted in them returning home empty-handed. He criticized the cold attitude of the US government, as follows:</p>
<p>The US government's extremely cold treatment of the Chongqing military delegation led by Xiong Shihui has greatly affected the friendly feelings existing between the people of Chongqing and the US. My opinion is that the US government has been influenced by Britain and has changed its policy, and is now focusing its main force on defeating Germany. In East Asia, the state of the US military is only being used to restore the British Empire's colonies. I feel extremely regretful about Xiong Shihui's unavoidable return home, and I do not want to say it explicitly, so I would like to ask a question before the American people. If the leader of the anti-Axis countries does not now show any intention of jointly fighting Japan with Chongqing, then what value does Xiong Shihui have in staying in Washington? He is a person who is not accustomed to wasting time, and recently he has been forced to waste time, and as a result, he has been driven to irritability. In order to ask the American people to understand his mood, I think it is okay to set up the following metaphor. Suppose you visit a friend's house and are left in a corner of the guest room. Not to mention seven months, but only seven minutes, you seek to be looked after. Then, wouldn't you be afraid of being impolite and try to maintain a smile on your face? If you smile for seven minutes without being entertained, will you feel ridiculous and indignant? At that time, what will you do? I think you will politely bid farewell to the host and leave. After returning home, if you understand humor, you will definitely regard everything as ridiculous and laugh. Now, he who is about to leave the United States and return to Chongqing is in a similar situation. The US government must be satisfied with the friendly feelings existing between Chongqing and the US, and hope that they will continue indefinitely. The Chongqing side likes Americans without any special reason, but simply likes Americans for no reason. Therefore, if the friendly feelings are once destroyed, there will be nothing to connect Chongqing and the US. Xiong Shihui's visit to the US was not solely to obtain aid. Obtaining aid was only part of his mission. He was actually visiting the US to lend a helping hand to establishing a common front, but the US did not want his help, so his return to Chongqing was also unavoidable. When the anti-Axis countries complete their preparations for a common operation against Japan in the future, the US military commander can go to Chongqing and be commanded by Xiong Shihui. The American people should not forget this fact, that is, this military delegation to the US was carefully selected and appointed, and one of the best experts on Japanese military affairs was its leader. The American people must be asking whether Chongqing feels angry? However, what Chongqing feels is not anger. Xiong Shihui is a follower of Lao Tzu, so he is afraid that he will feel that it is useless to make the heads of the US military understand that Chongqing is also an ally of the US. Those who believe in Taoism have no way but to laugh at such foolishness.</p>

<h3>Indian Political Figures Pay Attention to the US Representative's Visit to India: Phillips Strives to Meet with Gandhi, But It Is Difficult to Have Any Concrete Results</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 10th (Domei News Agency) – A dispatch from New Delhi states that Indian political figures are paying attention to whether President Roosevelt's representative, Phillips, will be able to meet with Gandhi after arriving in India. After arriving in India, Rowe claimed that he would meet with representatives of various Indian parties, which conflicted with London's previous claims that Phillips would not interfere in India's internal affairs. Many believe that even if Phillips can meet with Gandhi, it is difficult to have any concrete results, because Gandhi is the person who is most strongly opposed to US interference.</p>
<h3>100,000 US Doctors Serve in the Military</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) – A dispatch from Washington states that the United States recently recruited 10,000 doctors into the ranks. In total, there are 100,000 US doctors currently serving in the military. It is said that the number of doctors serving the people in the United States in the future may be less than 80,000.</p>
<h3>Active Air Forces on Both Sides on the North African Front: British Troops Reinforce Libya from Egypt, Spatz Serves as Allied Air Force Commander</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 9th (Havas) – According to news from both the British and American sides and the Axis countries, the war on the Tunisian front was not very active yesterday. Only encounter battles between scout troops on both sides occurred on land, but air force activity was as usual. On the Libyan front, the war was most intense in the southeast of Misrata. A large number of reinforcements from General Montgomery's troops have been transferred from Egypt. The British army dispatched troops all day, apparently attempting to probe the weaknesses of the Axis army's position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to news received last night, only air force activity occurred on the North African front. Eighteen British planes were shot down on the Libyan front. German and Italian aircraft scattered tank convoys and destroyed more than 150 vehicles. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, the main force of the British army is concentrated south of the Axis army, where a fierce battle is about to take place.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas) – According to an official announcement, Axis aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery shot down 23 Allied aircraft yesterday. On the 8th of this month, the German Air Force bombed the Allied airfield south of the Atlas Mountains, causing fuel injectors to catch fire and burn, and destroying two enemy aircraft on the ground. In this battle, two enemy twin-engine aircraft and one Spitfire fighter were also shot down in the air. In addition, it was learned that the German aircraft had bombed the port facilities of Bona last time, resulting in heavy material losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency) – Allied Commander General Eisenhower appointed Major General Spatz as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Air Force in North Africa on Saturday.

<h3>Canada Appoints First Minister to the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Fierce Battles on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front: German Blitz Counterattack in the Central Route, Occupying 75 Strongholds</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Head of State, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to the war report of the German High Command today, fierce battles continued on the southern route of the Eastern Front yesterday. German troops once again repelled the Soviet offensive. In this battle, another Soviet brigade was repelled at a certain stronghold. Only positional warfare occurred near Leningrad. Twelve Soviet aircraft were shot down. In the central route, German infantry occupied 75 strongholds in a lightning offensive, destroying its defensive lines. After a fierce battle, the Soviet army lost 17 tanks on the shores of Lake Ilmen. On the Arctic Front, the German Air Force continued to destroy the railway to Murmansk. Soviet border, 9th (Havas) – There was no change on the Eastern Front yesterday. The war continued in the original areas, but the German army launched several fierce counterattacks in the central route, occupying several positions of the Red Army and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The Red Army's repeated counterattacks in the Velikiye Luki area were all repelled. From the Red Army's war report, it is no longer mentioned that the city of Velikiye Luki is only mentioned around the area, which can be seen. According to German military sources, all the tanks used by the Red Army for combat are manufactured in the country, proving that the scope of British military aid to the Soviet Union is extremely small. The quality of the Red Army's tanks seems to be inferior to last year.</p>

<h3>Supporting the Policy of Joining the War, Various Sectors Hold Mass Rallies, Vowing to Dedicate Manpower and Resources to the Nation, Hoping that all Merchants and Residents of the City Thoroughly Understand the Significance of Joining the War</h3>
<p>After the National Government announced a formal declaration of war against Britain and the United States on the previous (9th) day, in cooperation with the friendly nation of Japan to complete the Great East Asia Liberation War, all sectors of the military, civilians, government officials, and merchants here were inspired and unanimously supported the decision. Various organizations and groups responded enthusiastically. In addition to producing and distributing various slogans and propaganda materials for widespread dissemination, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office and the City Social Movement Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations held a "Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War" at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The various organizations and groups participating in the rally included the Municipal Government, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, the City Social Movement Association, the City Party Headquarters, the City Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the press, cultural circles, and agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, totaling over 100,000 people. After formal greetings, Yuan Fudeng, nominated by the presidium of the rally, served as the chairman of the rally and announced the purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, heads of various agencies gave speeches, elucidating the significance of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. After speeches by Zhou Hualan from the cultural sector and Li Guohua, representative of the Anti-British and Anti-American Association, Chen Yaofu read out the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War circular telegram. Xi Peiwen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai New People's Movement Promotion Association, led the crowd in shouting slogans, followed by the screening of a film on the Great East Asia War of Liberation, which continued until around 6:00 PM when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Presidium: The presidium of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War included Yuan Fudeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce; Mayor Chen (represented by Zhao Zunyu); Zhou Hualan from the cultural sector; Li Guohua, Chen Yaofu from the Anti-British and Anti-American Association; Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office; Xu Liquiu, President of the Zhonghua Daily; Xi Peiwen, Secretary-General of the New People's Movement Promotion Association; Zhang Kun from the film industry; Chen Binhe and Huang Tianshi from the press, and others.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Meeting: Chairman of the rally, Yuan Fudeng, first reported the purpose of the meeting. The rally stated: "Today's Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War is the most glorious day in our nation's history. For the past few centuries, China has suffered from the oppression and humiliation of Europeans and Americans, who have insulted China as a sleeping lion. However, even a sleeping lion has its majesty and will awaken. They further mocked China as the 'sick man of East Asia,' insulting our nation's decline and lack of revival. In the past, our people endured all kinds of suffering, and enlightened individuals successively strived for strength. However, the power of a few did not have the opportunity to be fully realized. Since the 'December 8th' outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the spirit of our Great East Asian nation has been fully demonstrated. Chairman Wang resolutely joined the war to show thorough cooperation with friendly nations. Today, all of you represent the citizens of the city, supporting the government's national policy. We hope that all sectors in Shanghai will henceforth invigorate their spirits and fully assist the government in joining the war. At the same time, all sectors must thoroughly understand the significance of joining the war. We must consider the future of the nation and the people, strengthen our resolve, and work diligently to fulfill our responsibilities and create the glorious history of our nation for the past five thousand years."</p>
<p>Speeches by Officials: Next, Mayor Chen, representing Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu, gave a speech, stating, "The National Government's entry into the war is based on the will of the Chinese people. For a hundred years, China has suffered from imperialist economic, military, and cultural aggression. Now, we have reached the ideal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, and the entire nation will be liberated." Then, Director Feng of the Propaganda Department gave a speech, strongly advocating that China must join hands with Japan to complete the Great East Asia War, stating, "Yesterday, under the leadership of the supreme leader Chairman Wang, the National Government resolutely declared war against Britain and the United States. Everyone who has seen the full text of the agreement with Japan knows that this time, China, from a position of independence and for the sake of liberating the motherland, has risen up to declare war against Britain and the United States. All the so-called rumors of conscription are their last clumsy tricks to express their fear. We will never believe them. We unanimously support the government, complete the war, and strive for liberation."</p>
<p>Circular Telegram Supporting Entry into the War: The original text of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War circular telegram read: "To Chairman of the National Government, Presidents of Various Academies, Ministers, Chairmen of Various Committees, Chairmen of Provincial and Municipal Governments, All Domestic and Foreign Organizations, All Newspapers: Our compatriots have long suffered from the oppression of British and American aggressive forces. The Great East Asia War is sweeping away all enemies, providing a heaven-sent opportunity to liberate China and revive East Asia. Our supreme leader Chairman Wang inspires the masses and rises up to join the war. All those with blood and spirit are grateful and indignant, willing to dedicate manpower and resources to the nation to strive for final victory, restore our independence and freedom, and complete the Three People's Principles of the founding father. Today, at 3:00 PM, we convened a mass rally at the Daguangming Theater in Shanghai, and it was resolved to unanimously support the government, obey the leader, and vow to complete the war with a spirit of shared life and death. We hope that compatriots in the peace zones and in the areas coerced by the Chongqing Communists, as well as all ethnic groups in the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, will quickly catch up and provide support. The telegram is filled with extreme urgency. From the 100,000 participants of the Shanghai All Sectors Rally in Support of the Government's Entry into the War, respectfully, steam."</p>
<p>Various Groups Respond with Respectful Telegrams: Since the National Government announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, various groups have unanimously responded with respectful telegrams. Extracts are listed below: (1) To Chairman Wang of the National Government: Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been on the verge of collapse, but they still have remnants and are trying to struggle. We should strive to eliminate them. Your Excellency, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and with no retreat, has resolved to declare war. Upon hearing the news, our associations wholeheartedly support it. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Jointly from the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai Special Municipality and the Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District, leading all district branches, respectfully, steam. (2) To Chairman of the National Government: The cooperative relationship between China and Japan has been further strengthened since your visit to Japan.

Upon hearing the news, our associations are extremely excited and wholeheartedly support it. Jointly from the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, respectfully, true.</p>
<h3>Soap Rationing: Retail Purchase Limited to One Bar</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory, China Soap Company, and China Chemical Industrial Society jointly announced the implementation of fixed prices for Gu Ben, Huang Xiangmao, Jian Dao, and other laundry soaps allocated to retailers, stating: "Our companies have been ordered to notify all retailers of allocated soaps that the retail price of these brands of soap must not exceed the following fixed prices: (1) Gu Ben soap, 80 military yen per bar; (2) Jian Dao soap, 77 military yen per bar; (3) Huang Xiangmao soap, 73 military yen per bar. Each person is limited to purchasing at most one bar of each of the above brands of soap (i.e., two cakes)."</p>
<h3>Approved by Military Allocation Authorities: Broad Beans Allocated to Various Industries, Registration to be Applied for Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Group Office of the Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Trade Association has received a large allocation of broad beans from the military allocation authorities, which has already arrived in Shanghai. From today, the allocation will be made to miscellaneous grains retailers, sauce gardens, distilleries, tofu shops, fried goods shops, tofu stall operators, and bean sprout producers. The fixed price of broad beans is 46.5 military yen per picul (equivalent to 100 market catties). A notice has been issued, instructing them to apply for registration at the office immediately for allocation.</p>
<h3>Another Cooking Oil Sale Within the Year: Soybeans and Sesame Seeds Shipped to Shanghai Have Been Allocated and Received</h3>
<p>Since the category B oil shops in the two concessions started selling oil on the 7th, they unanimously announced that they had sold out by the afternoon of the 9th. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, there will be another cooking oil sale by the category A oil shops in the two concessions before the end of the lunar year, but the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the agreement on the exchange of goods between Shanghai and North China, the authorities decided to ship 8,333 tons of Manchurian soybeans and 6,666 tons of sesame seeds to Shanghai. Of these, 4,600 tons of soybeans and all of the sesame seeds have already been shipped and allocated.</p>
<p>Special Ration Oil Must Be Purchased from Designated Oil Shops: The Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office issues special allocations to civil servants, ranging from half a catty to one catty per person per month or period. However, each office issues special purchase certificates for this special allocation of oil, which must be used to purchase oil. As each pao is currently trying out the system of distributing oil by household, each retail oil shop has a fixed number of households that can purchase, with the quantity determined by their numbers. Therefore, it is inconvenient to sell the special allocation, which often leads to misunderstandings. The pao-chia authorities have now stipulated that each pao designate one oil shop exclusively for special allocations. Civil servants must purchase oil from the designated oil shop with their special allocation certificates, and other shops are absolutely forbidden to sell to them. According to senior officials of the pao-chia authorities in the two concessions, speaking to reporters from the Central News Agency, the pao-chia authorities are very willing to assist and cooperate with the authorities' plan to implement oil distribution by population, as it can indirectly help with household registration surveys.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rural District Party Office Holds Party Affairs Meeting: The Central Government and Concurrent Director Chen Issue Telegrams of Instruction and Encouragement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Nationalist Party, in order to review the implementation of Party affairs work in the rural areas of the city, held a Party affairs meeting at its office in Zhoupu Town at 10:00 AM on the 10th, lasting for two days. A preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. The Central Government and Chen, the concurrent director of the Shanghai branch of the Rural Affairs Commission, both sent telegrams with instructions, hoping for the completion of the rural affairs mission.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Establishes an Office in Western Shanghai to Encourage Local Businesses to Join Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, recognizing that the area of western Shanghai is vast and commercially prosperous, had a suggestion from a business committee member to establish a western Shanghai office to assist existing trade associations and encourage local businesses to join them to strengthen connections. The joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the association decided to approve the establishment and appointed Zheng Jianbo as the preparatory officer for the western Shanghai office to actively begin preparations. It is reported that the office has been prepared and, in accordance with the organizational charter of the office, recommended Le Fenglin from local businessmen as deputy director, dividing the office into three sections: administration, finance, and investigation, each performing its duties. The position of director is being requested by the preparatory officer from the head office for immediate appointment, so that the office can be established and begin the investigation work within days.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning at 7:00 AM: Emergency Alert Drill</h3>
<p>An air raid emergency alert was heard in the city at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 10th). Because it was at a time when residents were fast asleep, there was little movement. However, the security corps and the civil police corps, being on duty at their posts, were reported by the reporting team members in each pao, who rang bells and awoke residents by informing them of windows with light leaking out, and ordered them to extinguish the lights. The emergency alert was lifted at 8:00 AM. It was heard that the nature of the alert was a drill. Furthermore, it was reported that police stations of the city district and the two settlements all sent letters to the pao-chia districts under their jurisdiction, instructing the residents to turn off the electric lights or add curtains to the windows to absolutely prevent light from leaking out of the windows during the long-term exercises.</p>
<h3>Noodle and Bakery Industries Request Changes to the Exchange System</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the changes to the method of flour allocation to various noodle shops, the local noodle industry has appealed to the authorities for changes. The Bakery Trade Association has also dispatched representatives to submit a report to the Municipal Council, with the main points of the report being: (1) The flour and rice allocated to civilians are insufficient, which greatly affects the business. (2) These industries are all small businesses that purchase flour, produce, and sell immediately. If customers do not come to exchange, and the products are left unsold, the capital cannot be circulated. (3) The personnel in these industries are mostly illiterate, and it is difficult for them to understand the expiration dates on the flour certificates and where to collect them. Moreover, there are often unnecessary disputes with customers who do not understand the exchange rates. (4) If there is preparation for exchange of finished pastries, but no one exchanges, the products will mold, resulting in a gradual reduction of the flour stock and easy losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association Sponsors a Japanese Painting and Sculpture Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, in order to integrate the art of the two countries, has scheduled a Japanese landscape and customs painting exhibition from January 25th to 31st at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the New World Department Store on Nanjing Road. A sculpture exhibition will also be held at the same time, hosted by the Chinese artist Zhang Yuanren. It is reported that exhibitions of these two types are rarely held in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Cultural Association Held a Symposium Yesterday</h3>
<p>The preparations for the establishment of the "Chinese Cultural Association," a nationwide cultural organization initiated and organized by many in the Shanghai cultural sector, have been extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, a symposium for initiators was held on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel, attended by dozens of people. The association has now received support from well-known cultural figures from Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. Mayor Chen is willing to do his best to assist, and Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office also has high expectations. It is reported that the association will be formally established at the end of the month and is currently expanding its recruitment of members.</p>
<h3>French Consul-General Announces Praise for Pao-Chia Chinese Staff</h3>
<p>French Consul-General Magre announced: The French Consul-General issued Consul-General Order No. 4 on January 6, 1943, to organize the Standing Committee of the Pao-Chia in the French Concession, and expressed his deep gratitude to the Provisional Preparatory Committee of the Pao-Chia for completing the work of weaving the Pao-Chia system. This is because the efforts of the committee members, especially the Chinese members, in organizing this good system, have led to honest cooperation between the residents and the authorities, resulting in very satisfactory results, such as household registration for food distribution and air defense facilities, which would be difficult to complete without the Pao-Chia, and various current difficulties would be difficult to improve. The organization of the Pao-Chia is particularly helpful to the work of the police department, as illegal elements cannot find a place to stay in the concession, and criminal acts have been almost completely eliminated. The French Consul-General hopes that the members of the Standing Committee of the Pao-Chia, as well as the members of the former Preparatory Committee of the Pao-Chia, will continue to work hard and cooperate closely, as in the past, in order to solve various problems that may arise in the future.</p>
<h3>China Education Construction Association Establishes a Western Shanghai Branch</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Education Construction Association convened its inaugural meeting yesterday after preparations to establish a branch in the Western Shanghai district. The meeting adopted the branch charter and elected twenty-one directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Financial Leaders Discuss: Restriction of Deposit Withdrawals is Untrue. Shanghai Officials Telegraph the Capital to Inquire. Reply Telegram States the Rumor is False</h3>
<p>Following the announcement of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, rumors suddenly spread in the city that the government was restricting the withdrawal of deposits, causing unrest among the people. According to financial leaders in the city, in order to stabilize the financial market in view of the rumors of restricting deposit withdrawals, a telegram was sent to the Nanjing authorities to inquire about the matter. A reply telegram has been received stating that there is absolutely no such thing. It is hoped that the public will not lightly believe in or spread rumors and disturb themselves.</p>
<p>Macau Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Lin Shiliang and Others Embezzlement and Malfeasance Case (Continued)</h3>
<p>The defendant Lin Shiliang was then brought in for questioning. Lin was wearing a dark blue woolen robe and silver-rimmed glasses. He looked disheveled, with his hair a mess. He was pale and walked into the courtroom with a slumped posture, after which the judge questioned him one by one. According to his account: Lin Shiliang, 37 years old, former director of the Transportation Department of the Central Trust Bureau. He said that he had only known Zhang Dewu for a few months in Yangon, and there was no discord between them. In January of this year, when Yangon was at its most critical, he knew that Zhang had a large number of goods that could not be shipped out and asked him to find a way. He then signed a contract with Zhang, which he later reported to Xu Xingchu and received a reply from him approving it. Although the Trust Bureau did not have regulations regarding this matter and whether it was beneficial or harmful to the Bureau, and because there was not enough time to ask for instructions, he proceeded without notifying the Kunming branch after obtaining Xu Xingchu's permission to handle it at his discretion. He was asked whether he had gone to the inspection station to negotiate and identify the goods after they were seized. Lin stated: Yes. He was also asked: Did you agree with Zhang Dewu in advance to supply the goods to various government agencies at a flat price? Lin replied: In Yangon, I had mentioned that the goods must be sold to various agencies at the original price after being transported inland. He was also asked about the contents of the contract and the owners of the 35 trucks. Lin stated: The contract stipulated that the 35 trucks were not within the scope of the contract, and it was stated that the goods were priced at 30 million yuan and transported to Kunming in the name of the Trust Bureau. All expenses and accidental losses along the way were to be borne by the Dacheng Company. After the goods arrived in Kunming, the Trust Bureau would purchase them all. If the Bureau did not want to accept them, it would still have to pay transportation commissions. Finally, he was asked why, if the value of the goods was only 30 million yuan, there was no great profit for the Trust Bureau. Lin replied: Because prices rose after January, the price could reach 40 million yuan, so I thought it would be beneficial to the Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>Finally, Xu Xingchu was summoned. He stated: 32 years old, currently serving as Secretary-Director of the Board of Directors of the Trust Bureau, and concurrently as Manager of the Bureau's Purchasing Department. He said that he had recently resigned from his concurrent post on September 18 due to internal organizational reasons. The Bureau's Purchasing Department is entrusted by relevant authorities to purchase materials, and the Trust Bureau has no right to buy or sell. As for whether a large amount of funds needs to be approved by the Board of Directors, it is a matter of procedure. The contract in this case was established and signed in Chongqing after the review of the relevant documents. The handling fees and reserve funds can be paid later. If there is no insurance policy, it must be submitted first. Regarding the seizure of the goods in Kunming, he only learned about it after the transportation procedures were completed, so the contract was signed on March 10. When asked about Lin's statement that he had obtained Xu's approval in advance, Xu said: I replied in my letter that I would handle it in principle at my discretion. The letter was issued on January 20. Because the letter was a private letter, it was not registered or filed. The official letter to the Central Bureau of Statistics on March 13 was signed by me. The ownership of the trucks was not clear at the time. As for Lin Shiliang's claim that I had instructed him to pay attention to a large number of national defense materials to supply to the Purchasing Department when he left for Yangon, it is true. The judge then announced the end of the trial and that the sentence would be pronounced according to law at a later date.</p>
<p>(Another report) It is reported that after the "Chief Military Law Supervisor" interrogated Lin Shiliang in the embezzlement and malfeasance case on the 17th, in addition to the defendant Lin Shiliang, who was returned to the prison of the department in accordance with the law, the defendant Xu Xingchu, who had previously been unable to leave his post as Secretary-Director of the "Board of Directors of the Trust Bureau," was approved by the authorities to be released on bail. After this interrogation, it was determined that he was suspected of being related to the case, and he was also detained on the spot by the department to await the verdict and legal action.</p>
<p>"According to the main criminal in this case, Lin Shiliang, has already been sentenced to death, and Xu Xingchu has been sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Detailed circumstances will be sent later." (Sent on December 10, 31st year).</p>

<h3>After Various Groups Register: Prices Will Be Carefully Adjusted. The Goods Control Office Will Exercise its Authority.</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council authorities will regulate prices based on the various trade and manufacturing joint groups within the International Settlement, instructing them on various methods. Therefore, the registration of these groups is almost complete. Afterwards, the Municipal Council will order them to submit price lists, which the authorities will carefully deliberate and amend. It is reported that the Municipal Council will implement per capita distribution of various major foods to ensure fair distribution to consumers. The first step in its implementation is to implement per capita distribution of food and cooking oil, followed by extending it to major foods. Due to this relationship, the importance of expanding the organizational scope of the Municipal Council Goods Control Office is evident. At the same time, it is also known that preparations have been made to actually increase the effectiveness of the new organization.</p>
<h3>Tram Fares Will be Readjusted: Five-Cent Fractions Will Be Abolished, and Station Distances Will be Lengthened Appropriately</h3>
<p>According to senior officials of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, the fare prices of the trams and trolleybuses on various routes in the settlements will be readjusted. This adjustment is different from previous price increases, and the decided methods are two: (1) Because the five-cent auxiliary coins are gradually becoming scarce on the market, and the fare prices often have five-cent fractions, refunds are inconvenient. The authorities will appropriately increase or decrease the fares by five cents, depending on the length of the journey, to make them whole numbers. (2) Station distances will be lengthened. In the past, fares were calculated based on station distances, and the station distances were often inconsistent, resulting in unreasonable fares. In the future, there will be a thorough adjustment. For example, the distance of the 17th trolleybus route from Sichuan Road Bridge to Jiangxi Road is one station. Now, it is decided to extend it to Nanjing Road as one station. Therefore, after the adjustment, the fares for some sections will be slightly increased, and the fares for some sections will be reduced. The fare price list for each route is being printed and will be implemented from the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Notices for Insurance Brokers to Obtain Licenses</h3>
<p>Registration of insurance brokers and notaries began on the 5th of this month and has been enthusiastically and diligently carried out. Any insurance broker or notary applying for registration must possess the qualifications specified in Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Insurance Broker and Notary Registration Rules, prepare all the necessary supporting documents and photos, pay the certificate fee of 500 yuan and stamp duty of 4 yuan, and submit them to the Bureau for onward transmission to the relevant ministry for approval and issuance of the certificate. It must have the signatures and seals of the directors of the Insurance Trade Association and the Broker Association to be valid. It is estimated that there are over a thousand insurance brokers and notaries in Shanghai. After registration, the illegal insurance abuses can be thoroughly eliminated.</p>
<h3>Increased Sales Volume of Sugar to be Implemented from Yesterday. January Allocation Amount Will be Issued in Advance to the Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has submitted a request to the authorities for an increased sugar allocation. The third phase of purchasing sugar with housing tax receipts has been implemented from yesterday. Each housing tax receipt can purchase 50 yuan of sugar. However, for the autumn housing tax receipts in the International Settlement, the September and October receipts in the French Concession, and those without housing tax receipts in southwestern Shanghai and Zhabei, each household registration certificate can be used to purchase 5 yuan of sugar. Those who purchase sugar with housing tax receipts must bring their own citizen's card with the same address to be allowed to purchase, in order to prevent abuses, and it must be distributed equally according to the number of households. Those who violate this rule will be allowed to report and be held accountable. The allocation amount for January has been approved and the allocation procedures are being rushed. The allocation date for category A retailers will be advanced. On the 15th, a notice will be issued to all retailers, limiting the time to pay the sugar fees and receive the sugar certificates to pick up the goods from the designated sugar warehouses for sale to the market. The application registration date for sugar needed by category B users in various industries is approved until the day of the deadline. Once the review is completed, a special allocation will be made. However, applications submitted after the deadline will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Two Charitable Organizations Co-operate to Run a Winter Relief Programme in Western Shanghai and Build a Shelter in Jinha Lane</h3>
<p>The West Shanghai Zhu Shi Relief Association, which was founded by Zhang Deqin and others, has been actively appealing to provide relief for the poor in Western Shanghai for nearly two months. The association has built a shelter in Jinjia Lane to accommodate the poor people sleeping on the streets, and so far it has reached more than 400 people. The World Red Swastika Society requested the association to cooperate with them on the congee distribution, and to proceed together in order to achieve great efficiency. The association has agreed to cooperate, and the two sides have held several meetings to discuss the implementation policy, and consider the results to be satisfactory. As for the site of the congee distribution center, Jinjia Lane was previously crowded with poor people, and has recently suffered a fire, so the emotions are extremely miserable. It has been decided to set up the center there. It is reported that application forms will be distributed within days to receive the congee distribution tickets.</p>
<h3>The China Central Tobacco Rationing Association: Allocation Methods Undecided</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association stating that the previous report regarding the China Central Cigarette Rationing Association, specifically concerning the determination of methods for dispatching personnel, established qualifications for related businesses, registration restrictions, and the need to pay guarantee deposits, as well as the allocation of goods to other locations being handled by the Jiuda Company, is incorrect. The association clarifies that it is still in the preparatory stage, and the regulations for local related businesses are currently under discussion. As for other locations, apart from the stipulation in the articles of association to establish branches in important locations, no specific plans have been made yet. This letter serves to clarify the situation and prevent misinformation.</p>
<h3>The Economic Foundation and Resource Development of Greater East Asia —Translated from "Economist," December 1942—</h3>
<p>Basic Principles of Development</p>
<p>In the materials mobilization plan for the year 1942 (Showa 17, corresponding to the 31st year of the Republic of China—Translator), it is stated that a portion of essential materials is expected to be sourced from and secured in occupied territories in the South. There are reports that the supply and demand of kerosene is planned to be met by acquiring it from the Southern occupied areas, and special consideration and planning are underway. Additionally, the 1942 plan for the Second Productivity Expansion Plan includes the provision that adjustments may be made to the established production expansion plan in response to the supply and demand of materials and the acquisition of resources from the South. Therefore, it is evident that Southern resources will play a significant role in securing future productivity.</p>
<p>However, the development of Southern resources, particularly the utilization of essential materials, is subject to limitations related to shipping. Thus, the contribution of Southern resources to Japan's productivity is restricted. And, specifically regarding vital national defense resources, the resources already developed in the Southern regions, including those within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, are not as abundant as commonly believed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the importance of Southern resources to Japan is undeniable. As exploration progresses, the discovery of previously unknown minerals and the confirmation of larger deposits will gradually become a reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of the South, Prime Minister Tojo announced four principles in the plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 23 of this year as permanent policies for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The following six points, clarified by Director-General Suzuki of the Planning Board, provided a concrete explanation:</p>
<p>(1) Among Southern resources, some require urgent development, while others can be developed later. The order of development should be determined according to the urgency of the resource's need and the condition of transportation, as the war situation progresses. The draft guidelines, considering these factors, will be decided centrally.</p>
<p>(2) For resources deemed necessary for urgent development, such as kerosene, minerals, and agricultural and forestry products, the development should avoid the form of consolidated companies or joint ventures. Instead, those with experience and ability should be given the opportunity to fully demonstrate their enthusiasm and creativity, ensuring efficient production. Therefore, Japanese enterprises that have been diligently operating in the region for many years, or even non-Japanese enterprises that have shown sincerity in cooperating with Japan, should be utilized.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding currency, military scrip denominated in local currency will be used temporarily, circulating at the same value as the local currency. As the situation allows, the functions of the local currency and military scrip will be gradually adjusted and unified.</p>
<p>(4) The temporary transfer of funds to and from the local area, and the funds required for resource development, will be facilitated smoothly by the Southern Development Bank in the local area.</p>
<p>(5) All transactions with the local area, whether import or export, will be conducted by the government. The procurement and distribution will, of course, utilize existing Japanese merchants, as well as organizations and credit of locals and overseas Chinese who cooperate with Japan.</p>
<p>(6) With regard to enemy countries, every effort should be made to implement policies to acquire and supply local specialty resources produced in the Southern regions, such as rubber, tin, and Manila hemp.</p>
<p>The ongoing development of the South, based on the aforementioned fundamental principles, is indicated in the "Basic Policies for Mining, Forestry, and Electricity Construction" by the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council: "The South is currently focusing on promoting the mining and kerosene industries. At the same time, industries for processing various special products are also being promoted. Furthermore, with the gradual development of hydroelectric power generation, the expansion of the aluminum industry is planned. Light industries, in addition to consolidating existing ones, will be developed sequentially according to the available resources."</p>
<p>The following provides a separate description of the main development projects.</p>
<p>Vast Power Generation Plan</p>
<p>The Dutch government began constructing a large power generation plan a year ago, utilizing the flow of the Asahan River, which runs through central Sumatra, flowing out of Lake Toba in the Bukit Barisan mountain range. Due to the current war, the project has been halted, and the local army maintains the construction site. Upon completion, the project is expected to supply 00 kilowatts of power. This large-scale power plant design will provide significant inspiration for Japanese electrical development in Sumatra and Malaya in the future. Therefore, it is receiving considerable attention. According to the survey results of Mr. Masunaga, a former advisor to the Malayan Military Administration:</p>
<p>"The location of the power plant is 16 kilometers from the source of the Asahan River, which drains water from Lake Toba into the Strait of Malacca. The Wilhelmina I power plant is built there. A few kilometers away is the planned site of the First Power Plant. Because the water flows rapidly from Toba-Balan, a mountain peak 900 meters high, the hydropower potential is extremely rich. The head of the First Power Plant is 000 meters, and the head of the Second Power Plant is 000 meters. The Pilieton Company, which undertook the project, began construction three years ago with the support of the Dutch government. The First Power Plant, part of the first phase, has already installed 00000 kilowatt generators (including 0 spare kilowatts), and the dam and other projects have progressed to an average of 20%. The Second Power Plant is only in the planning stage and has not yet started construction. It is said that the equipment was ordered from the United States, America, and Switzerland shortly before the war.</p>
<p>If the project proceeds urgently, it is expected to be completed within a year. However, the Dutch side seems to plan to build an alumina factory 60 kilometers downstream from the first power plant in order to implement large-scale alumina production. The site still retains the factory foundations and construction site. The mechanical equipment of the power plant has been destroyed by the enemy, and the construction equipment is being transported by mountain residents. However, the basic engineering remains in its original condition. If the Dutch authorities initially planned to complete the project, 00 kilowatt electricity could be obtained. Because the electricity of ○○ million kilowatts, even the largest power plant in Japan, has only a power of about ○○ kilowatts or less, its richness is truly surprising. Moreover, the water volume is abundant and the terrain is extremely favorable, so it can supply inexpensive electricity. According to my estimate, the electricity cost per kilowatt hour is only about 2.5 sen, while in mainland Japan, the electricity cost per kilowatt hour is generally 1.5 sen. Therefore, its cost is incomparably low."</p>
<p>Regarding the Sumatra power source development, Nippon Nitrogen Fertilizer Co. has obtained the understanding of the Sumatra military government in order to realize the development plan. Prior to that, it has begun investigating land conditions, and it is said that the survey has been completed. Recently, it will be actively started. It is also said that Nippon Electric will supply 00 million kilowatts. (Translator's note)</p>
<p>Mining Policy</p>
<p>Previously, the East Indian government, with the aim of supplying fuel for trains, mined a good vein near Kin, but it was only a small-scale test mining. The extracted coal was transported by a temporary light railway built from Kin to Arashum, and then transported by the official South Sumatra Railway to the port, where it was transshipped to ships. The maximum daily output is about 00 tons. Now that the power generation capacity has been increased to four times, the planned output of ○○ tons this year will of course be guaranteed. From the next year onwards, it is certain that the production volume will be higher than the annual output before the war.</p>
<p>The Bara Alam coal mine, which has been developed by the Malayan Coal Mine Company operated by Englishman Ral since 1925, has already produced about 10 million tons. It is said that there are still 100 million tons of reserves. Earlier, in 1923, early Japanese pioneers gathered funds from local Japanese to try to develop the mine with Japanese capital and Japanese miners. However, due to various reasons, the project failed. This is the history of Japanese people managing the mine for many years.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, the Banh and Na Na mines, which were previously closed by the Vietnamese government, are now being developed by a Japanese-French joint venture. The Tu Yiban mining area is also being operated by a Japanese-French joint venture, and the Luo De Qin mining area is also under development.</p>
<p>Regarding petroleum, as explained by Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi in the Diet, the policy is to rapidly and extensively promote the development of oilfields obtained in the Southern regions. In particular, the restoration of the Balikpapan oil refinery in Borneo and the Sanga-Sanga oil field deserves attention. Before the war, Balikpapan had a population of 99,000, possessed the Samboja and Sanga-Sanga oil fields, and had an oil refinery of the Batavia Petroleum Company. The plant's annual production was 0000 tons, boasting the highest output in the Dutch East Indies, with a capital of 100 million guilders. Since the Japanese army occupied this place on January 24 of this year, the Japanese authorities have been working hard to restore the oil field and the oil refinery.</p>
<p>The Future of Rubber Resources</p>
<p>Currently, all rubber development and management in Malaya and Sumatra is entrusted to the Shonan Rubber Association. The Shonan Rubber Association is formed by approximately 0000 rubber operators. The companies joining the association include 0 production companies and 0 sales companies, totaling 00 companies. Almost all Japanese trading companies dealing with rubber in the southern region before the war are included.</p>
<p>In the past, rubber has been considered a representative of surplus production. However, the current Malayan military administration does not consider overproduction a problem. Therefore, they have not considered how to adjust production. Instead, they believe that resource development should not only focus on the phenomena of two or three years ago. Therefore, if Malaya and Sumatra produced 1 million tons of rubber before the war, the policy is to aim for the certain production of more than this amount after the war.</p>
<p>Current Status of Fiber Resources</p>
<p>Among fiber resources, the most important is cotton. Japanese cotton farmers had already entered the Philippines for cotton cultivation.</p>
<p>Currently, there are eight cotton growing areas in the Philippines: the first area, Cabite Province, a part of Batangas Province, with an area of 1.500; the second area, Laguna Province, a part of Batangas Province, a part of Mindanao Island, with an area of 1.500; the third area, Banbangge Province, a part of Ba An Province, with an area of 1.500; the fourth area, La Union Province, Tel Lake Province, Ban Jia Xi Nan Province, with an area of 1.500; the fifth area, Western Negros Province, Mana Bulaba Ge Gelo Province, with an area of 1.500; the sixth area, Western Negros Province, Victoria Dali Yi area, Mindanao Island, with an area of 1.500; the seventh area, Western Negros Province, La Carlo Trott area, with an area of 1.500; the eighth area, Western Negros Province, Binalbacan area, with an area of 1.500. (Unit: Machibu - Translator's note. One Machibu is approximately equal to 99.12 ares.)</p>
<p>It is planned to produce 5 million dan of cotton annually in five years.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, the military administration has also designated 0 companies as agencies for cotton cultivation and procurement in Myanmar, and established a five-year plan for increasing cotton production.</p>
<p>In addition, the Philippine Military Administration has also announced a five-year plan for increasing ramie and jute production.</p>
<p>Ramie is cultivated in Mindanao Island with 2,000 Machibu. From 1942 (Showa 17, corresponding to the 31st year of the Republic of China), it is planned to increase it by 500 Machibu in the first year, totaling 2,500 Machibu, to achieve a harvest of 960,000 catties. In subsequent years, through the use of idle land, the conversion of Manila hemp cultivation area, forest and other reclamation, it is planned to expand by 3,000 Machibu in the second year, 4,000 Machibu in the third year, and 5,000 Machibu in the fourth year. By the fifth year, a total of 15,000 Machibu or more of ramie cultivation area will be completed, aiming to achieve a harvest of 4 million Japanese catties (approximately 2.4 million kilograms).</p>
<p>Secondly, jute has never been cultivated in the Philippines. Now it is considered that the land conditions there are suitable, so cultivation has been started in Davao Province and Agusan Province in Mindanao Island. In the first year (1942), a small-scale trial planting of a total of 20 Machibu will be carried out. Therefore, it is currently engaged in the selection and transplantation of suitable seeds. It is planned to expand by 100 Machibu in the second year, 1,000 Machibu in the third year, and 2,000 Machibu in the fourth year. By the fifth year, a total of 4,000 Machibu of jute cultivation area will be completed. It is expected that there will be a harvest of 6,000 catties per Machibu each year.</p>
<p>Regarding the guiding and controlling agencies for hemp such as Manila hemp, ramie, and jute, the Philippine Hemp Cultivation Association has recently been established under the Military Administration Department.</p>
<p>Jute has also been cultivated in Vietnam. Jute is being cultivated as a specialty in the Red River Basin, Tonkin Plains, especially in the suburbs of Hanoi in northern Vietnam. Hanoi suburbs are suitable for cultivating jute, and experts have proved it.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese authorities had long banned the export of jute and encouraged cultivation. In 1940, the original area of 464 hectares was expanded, 900 hectares in 1941, and a cultivation plan of 1,800 hectares, twice the previous year, was established this year. Moreover, it was decided to import excellent seeds from Taiwan and hire instructors to engage in large-scale planting.</p>
<p>The Departure of Sugar Industry Management</p>
<p>Regarding sugar, sugarcane cultivation in the Philippines has been converted to cotton cultivation. Regarding the local sugar industry, as a result of discussions between the local authorities and the Japanese government, on August 1 of last year, six companies were officially designated as the responsible operators for the Javanese sugar industry.</p>
<p>More than 80 sugar factories and sugar industry areas in Java, which previously belonged to the British system, will be re-determined by the local authorities on how to allocate responsibilities. In addition, the administrative and sugar industry conditions in the Philippines are different from those in Java, so plans are being made to proceed in individual ways.</p>
<p>In Myanmar, the military administration has designated ○○ and entrusted it to manage the Jaya Waki factories in the Tone Gun and Yamechin areas.</p>
<p>Development Arrangement of the Oil and Fat Industry</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the oil and fat industry, the handling of southern coconut oil and even dried coconut kernels is considered to be less preferable than importing the surplus materials and processing them in mainland Japan according to the current situation of the oil and fat industry in mainland Japan. However, due to shipping constraints, it is not possible to import a large amount of coconut oil for processing. Also, there are several American and British enemy-owned oil and fat factories in the local area. Managing and operating these factories to achieve self-sufficiency in oil and fat products is essential. Therefore, a company has been designated to be responsible for operating these enemy-owned factories.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the development situation of major resources in the South. If this development proceeds step by step, a rapid advance in the Japanese economy can be expected. At that time, the Japanese economy must have completed a landmark transformation.</p>
<p>However, considering only the mineral resources that are already being developed, even in the entire Greater East Asia Sphere, they are not as rich and vast as commonly thought. This is especially true for the national defense resources that Japan currently needs most.</p>
<p>The country must never be arrogant in victory and relax its spirit," these are the words of Prime Minister Tojo and government officials, which must be carefully considered. (Translator's note)</p>

<h3>Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (10) Translated from the bi-monthly "Domei" in late November 1942</h3>
<p>Summary of Speeches by Each Headquarters Chief</p>
<p>Leng Jiaji—Acting Chief of North China Headquarters</p>
<p>On what economic foundation should the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be based? First, in view of the historical transformation of the solution of the world economy and the division of connected economies, Greater East Asia should become a self-sufficient economic sphere; second, a highly national defense economic sphere centered on Japan, or rather with Japan as its leader; third, an economic sphere based on the principles of liberalism and capitalism, and a total integrative planned economy. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be these three types of economic sphere. However, in order to establish the East Asian broad-area economic sphere and its self-sufficiency, each country must first establish its own national land plan. These national land plans of various countries are not separate plans that are irrelevant to each other, but rather integrated national land plans that are tailored to the specificities of each nation and country. In the eyes of the average person, my North China is only considered to have some value in primary industries and miscellaneous light industries. At present, we must break out of such a narrow perspective and try to redefine the industrial fields. Furthermore, regarding the resource issue of North China as a supply base, it is necessary to re-examine the industrial regulations of exporting only iron, bauxite, salt and other resources to Japan and Manchuria. In the future, we hope to utilize these underground resources and comprehensively plan the decentralized deployment of heavy industry and chemical industry to North China.</p>
<p>Munakata Hisataka—Chief of Mengjiang Headquarters</p>
<p>Under the ideals of the rise of the East Asian nations and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of Mengjiang are currently suffering in any way, but are very happy to cooperate with Japan to advance in order to realize this great ideal. In July of this year, in addition to implementing a low-price policy, Mengjiang also officially set commodity prices. Through the Mengjiang Kinrin Association, the donation campaign for copper was also held, and in February and March, the people's donations were very enthusiastic. In the spring of this year, the Agricultural and Commercial Association launched a savings campaign, which reached a huge number of more than 7 million yuan in less than a month. The Mengjiang economy has close relations with Japan, North China, Manchuria, Korea, etc. If these relations become more profound in the future, Mengjiang's production will surely continue to expand. Whether it is coal or other mineral resources, it should not only be provided to Mengjiang itself, but also to the entire Greater East Asia economy, which is considered to be an expanded production.</p>
<p>However, there are two dangers that weaken and isolate the Mengjiang economy: one is the obstruction of the inflow of materials from other regions, and the other is excessive exchange rate restrictions. We hope to understand these and help Mengjiang stabilize its exchange rate, increase production, and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Chen Shao-i—Chief of Central China Headquarters</p>
<p>The new economic path of Greater East Asia is to make the exchange of materials between regions smooth and unhindered, so that the inner circle can become self-sufficient. Now, because transportation is very scarce, ships must be given priority for military needs, and the general public must think of building sailing ships to replace them. We can form a team of fifty ships, with surveillance and escort ships set up next to the fleet, and the mother ship can be equipped with wireless telegraphs and weapons. In this way, the enemy will have no way to take advantage of the gap. I think that the widespread construction of these sailing ships is a wonderful way to remedy the stagnation of transportation. If this matter can be actively promoted, it will definitely be of great benefit to the exchange of materials in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Closing of the Roundtable Conference</p>
<p>The afternoon session of the third day of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference was held from 1:50 p.m. After unanimously passing the following statement, Chairman Ogura delivered a closing speech, and then the official announcement was adjourned. The three-day conference ended here.</p>
<p>Passed Statement</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War a year ago, thanks to the brave battles of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, the tyrannical American and British forces that had long been conspiring to invade and exploit East Asia have been thoroughly eliminated. Today, the foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been established and consolidated. However, the United States and Britain still rely on their strong productivity and repeatedly attempt their futile counterattacks. Therefore, in order to uphold the Greater East Asia War and establish the great cause of constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we must integrate the Greater East Asia economy into one, highly leverage the comprehensive economic strength of Greater East Asia, and make further efforts to enhance wartime productivity. All of this is the inescapable responsibility of us, the economic people of Greater East Asia. The East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference, which is composed of economic people from various regions of Greater East Asia as members and aims to promote the construction of the Greater East Asia economy, has now opened its fourth conference. On the one hand, it explains the fundamental ideals of the construction of the Greater East Asia economy to the economic people of East Asia. At the same time, it analyzes in detail the situation of the Greater East Asia War and the situation in the world. Under these studies and analyses, it has made sincere and constructive discussions on the progress and operation of the economy of each region in Greater East Asia. Based on the results of this discussion, with the aim of actual money, we hope to work together with one heart and one mind to win the Greater East Asia War and complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and make further efforts.

<h3>Tung Wah Wins Right to History Cup Final</h3>
<p>In another scene of the History Tok Cup football semi-final this year, Tung Wah faced the Jewish Association at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3:30. Because the previous day's United Friends team was miserably eliminated, everyone's hopes were pinned on Tung Wah. No fewer than 5,000 people watched from the stands. Yesterday, Tung Wah's old partner Wu Binghao returned to Shanghai due to some matter. The team's morale was greatly boosted by the addition of this student soldier, who was very important to the team. Wen Kui's condition has improved day by day, and his passing is easy and beautiful, already looking like his old self. Ah Dai and You Liang maintained their normal state, and were even more active when the game was tough. The center-back line seemed to be dominated by Long Hai alone, and neither Fan Xiao, who usually suffered, nor Ding Boji dared to enter. Zhao Peng's merits and demerits offset each other, while Xi Sheng ran and kicked wildly. The defenders Li Ning and You Ren coordinated extremely well and were impeccable. Li's feet were sharp and crisp, restoring his former prowess. Bang Lun was stable and healthy, which was visible. Therefore, except for Xi Sheng, who was relatively weak, the ten generals all performed excellently. It is appropriate for the Jewish athletes to be defeated by the wind. The whole army was wiped out by one) to three. With this mighty army, it is not difficult to make St. Francis let us hold the cup. Less than five minutes after the start of the game, Ah Dai recorded the first goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah took the lead with one to zero. When the battle started again, Tung Wah's arrogance rose and controlled the overall situation. Kuntian shot through the net, clear and beautiful. Three minutes later, Xi Sheng lost the ball in the front. You Liang grabbed it and passed it to Ah Dai. Dai swept and scored. As a result, Tung Wah defeated the Jewish Association by three to zero, and will compete with St. Francis for the championship.</p>
<h3>Advice to Citizens to Economize Consumption</h3>
<p>— Sheng Yudu</p>
<p>Limit to Needs, Vigorously Avoid Hoarding</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking of the current situation in Shanghai, it is very clear that the supply and demand of various materials are unbalanced. This is inherently a possible phenomenon during extraordinary times, a natural trend. However, in Shanghai, in addition to natural trends, various artificial factors have accelerated the divergence between supply and demand and deepened the imbalance. For example, concerning food, the supply routes are inherently not smooth, and the supply is limited. However, the general public easily believes rumors and fails to deeply understand the maximum efforts made by the authorities regarding food. Instead, they often complain about heaven and blame others. Usually, in addition to purchasing daily necessities, they also try their best to hoard. This further raises the current needs infinitely, exacerbating the imbalance in supply. As a result, ordinary people suffer, and society is uneasy. Where do we even begin to address this?</p>
<p>Currently, to alleviate the imbalance in supply, we can only passively and relatively reduce demand. On the one hand, we must quickly abandon the overly sensitive and selfish hoarding behavior to avoid many unnecessary争奪; on the other hand, we must gradually reduce our standard of living and try our best to use substitutes. For example, using coarse grains, corn, or wheat flour to replace part of the rice indirectly increases the supply. Furthermore, regarding rice, it is normal to prepare a little for emergencies, but we must not compete to hoard large quantities, as the result will harm others and not benefit ourselves. In addition, utilizing gardens and open spaces to plant coarse grains can also increase production.</p>
<p>The Unemployed Should Voluntarily Evacuate</p>
<p>Moreover, Shanghai has such a large population. Except for those with necessary job-related reasons, many residents do not need to reside in Shanghai. Then, why not voluntarily evacuate to the countryside or their hometowns? On the one hand, it can reduce the burden of private life; on the other hand, it can also reduce the burden on the entire Shanghai society. Therefore, evacuating the population is also an effective measure to help solve the imbalance in the supply of materials in Shanghai. However, this matter requires the awareness and assistance of the people themselves to achieve practical results. Shanghai is a city with huge consumption. The external supply is so unreliable and difficult to obtain that it will inevitably increase. Even if the war ends, it will not be possible to balance the supply of materials immediately. Therefore, living in a drunken stupor and hoping for extravagance is asking for trouble. Only enduring hardship and reducing consumption is the proper way to cope with the current difficulties.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Starting from the Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>— Rong Guan</p>
<p>A friend of mine, because his income couldn't meet his expenses, sought ways to increase his income. He listened to the advice of a colleague and bought several thousand yuan worth of stocks with all his savings.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, a certain company called a shareholders' meeting. My friend had never been a shareholder in his life, so he was naturally excited to attend.</p>
<p>The shareholders' meeting was held at 2 PM and ended at 4 PM.</p>
<p>That night, my friend came to see me and kept shouting, "Bad luck! Bad luck! I was a guest for two hours."</p>
<p>"A shareholders' meeting is when shareholders show off, how can you say you were a guest?"</p>
<p>"You're making fun of an old friend! If you had gone, you would definitely shout 'bad luck' too!"</p>
<p>"I formally apologize to you, please tell me about the meeting."</p>
<p>"The election of the chairman was pre-arranged, so let's not talk about that. All the proposals were also pre-arranged; and the discussion, approval, opposition, and voting were all like a performance, all rehearsed. Although there were two or three hundred shareholders present, there were less than ten speakers. Their one-liner routines were unbearable. Finally, I couldn't help but stand up and ask the company to announce its recent business policies. Before I finished speaking, those guys who monopolized the meeting unanimously blocked me. I stood up again to clarify; the chairman interrupted me, saying it was late. Then they served some snacks and adjourned the meeting."</p>
<p>"That's outrageous!" I comforted my old friend.</p>
<p>"At the time, the shareholders sitting next to me said: This meeting was run by a few large shareholders; they really don't care about the opinions of one or two small shareholders!"</p>
<p>"That's right, Lao Li! A small shareholder's speech is originally ineffective. Even if your proposal is luckily passed, if it is unfavorable to the large shareholders, the vote will inevitably fail." "That's right, they have more votes and we small shareholders don't know each other, there is no contact, we stare with our eyes watching them manipulate, monopolize, do anything!"</p>
<p>Lao Li, don't be angry anymore! Isn't the parliamentary meeting in the ostensibly democratic politics of England and America similar to the shareholders' meeting? In the parliaments of England and America, isn't the opportunity to speak monopolized by a few representatives of large capitalists? If you don't know your place and insist on speaking, the speaker will turn a deaf ear and not answer! Today you spoke at the shareholders' meeting, and the chairman flattered you a few words, that's considered a great honor!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Hypocritical democratic politics!" My friend and I sighed the same way.</p>
<h3>The Tibetan-Indian Border (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jiayuan</p>
<p>Transmitted from Macau on January 5th</p>
<p>Although not a shortcut from India to Tibet, it is more convenient than taking the route through Xikang via Lhasa. After I came to India, I prepared to enter Tibet from India. However, entering Tibet from India is not as simple as imagined. Many friends advised me to give up this idea and told me about the difficulties along the way and the difficulty of passing through customs. However, these could not shake my determination to go to Tibet. Before leaving, I visited Tan Yunshan, who had been to Tibet. According to him, the situation when he entered Tibet was the same as what I am preparing for now. Not only did he have to disguise himself as a Tibetan, but he couldn't even say a word, otherwise he would be recognized. I will record my impressions of this trip as follows:</p>
<p>A Night in Northern India</p>
<p>The train from Calcutta to Kalimpong is a mainline heading due north. There is only one direct train every night, and it is crowded with passengers. It happened to be the British army's holiday, and they were traveling to Darjeeling in groups, completely filling all the carriages. According to the usual practice of Indian railways, as long as you give the stationmaster a small tip, you can find a comfortable berth. However, even if you give the stationmaster money at this time, there is still no way. Fortunately, I met a local friend who was going to Darjeeling, who allowed me to sit on his berth. Not long after settling down, I encountered a household registration police inspection. According to Indian household registration regulations, anyone leaving their place of residence should register with the police station. In order to reduce trouble, I did not report it. I had to say that I was going to Kalimpong for sightseeing. He saw that my registration form said I was a war correspondent, so he didn't make things difficult.</p>
<p>The train departed at 8:30. There were five berths in our carriage, but now there were seven passengers: two British airmen, two Chinese merchants, and Mr. Cheng, who had been in Tibet for a long time, plus the reporter, making four Chinese people. Everyone met in a foreign land and were very friendly. Because Mr. Cheng was familiar with the situation in Tibet, everyone asked him for advice, especially the two Shanghai merchants, whose purpose was to transport goods from Tibet to the mainland. This plan is practically impossible. That night, the moon was as round as a mirror, and moonlight shone in through the train window. Looking out the window, the scenery of India was as clear as day.</p>
<p>Impressions of Siliguri</p>
<p>The next morning at 7 AM, the train entered Siliguri Station. This place is close to the Himalayas. The train from Calcutta is already at its terminal. From here, there are two small railway branch lines, one heading north to Kalimpong, and one west to Darjeeling. However, the branch line to Kalimpong cannot go directly, it only runs halfway, to Kiligula. After getting off the military, the reporter and Mr. Cheng hired a car directly to Kalimpong. The 30-mile journey usually costs 10 or 20 rupees, but now it has increased to 35 rupees.</p>
<p>At about 8 AM, we set off from Siliguri and gradually entered the mountain road after about three miles. The higher we went, the more similar the road was to the ups and downs of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. There was a small train track on the side of the road that wound upwards. The forests were dense, and the scenery was excellent. Every few miles, there was a small village. Continuing forward, there were also iron cable bridges like those on the Yunnan-Burma Road, but they were too narrow for heavy trucks to pass through. At Kiligula, I saw people who looked very much like our Chinese people, gathered on the road, repairing the road surface. Half of them were women, carrying heavy loads of soil like men.</p>
<p>Going north and south, the mountains became higher and higher. The car drove on the asphalt road, winding straight up, before entering a flat valley and descending the mountain. We passed a newly built cement bridge. Here, there was a highway going east that had recently been completed, reaching Assam directly. This road has military value.</p>
<p>The car climbed up the mountain. Halfway up the mountain, there was an overhead iron cable used to transport goods to the top of Kalimpong Mountain. Generators were placed on the top and bottom of the mountain to drive the iron cable. The goods were then lifted to the mountain on iron plates on the iron cable, which was extremely convenient. Along the way up, there were height markers. When we reached 3,500 meters, buildings stood tall and houses were densely packed. This is Kalimpong, the main road to Tibet.</p>
<p>Merchants on the Tibetan-Indian Border</p>
<p>When the car arrived at the market entrance, I said goodbye to Mr. Cheng, promising to meet again. The reporter continued to drive straight up through the city's main street. After traveling two miles and reaching an altitude of 4,000 feet, I arrived at the Kalimpong office of the India Daily. This place is located on the road to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. High mountains surround it, and newly built residences are visible everywhere. After getting out of the car, I accompanied Li Yiwo, the manager of the newspaper, to visit Ma Jia Kui, who manages the western trade. Ma's residence is also near the main road, and the building is very large. Because it is built on the mountain, it has five floors in total. The interior layout is Shanghai style, mostly consisting of collapsed mats. There are also many Tibetans coming and going, wearing long-筒乌靴, wearing robes, keeping long braids, and dressing like ancient costumes of the Qing Dynasty, which are partners of the Ma family. It is said that there are only four or five families operating Tibetan trade like the Ma family, the most famous being Bang Dachang, Hong Sheng, 汇记, 铸记 and other companies operated by Tibetans themselves. In addition, other foreign merchants cannot directly trade in Tibet.</p>
<p>The Ma family is from Shengdi County in Yunnan. It was initially managed by his father, Ma Zhujun. Now, because Mr. Ma has returned to his hometown, it is managed by his son, Ma Jiakui. The goods transported are said to be transported from Lhasa via Xikang to Lijiang, and each shipment takes about three months to arrive.</p>
<p>Ma Jiakui is a young man in his thirties. When we met, he showed some embarrassment, but because of his relationship with President Zhai, he only said that he would wait for a while and notify me when there was a suitable opportunity and a proper companion. He also said that this matter was extremely difficult. If the companion was not the right person, something could happen. If something happened, the reporter would suffer little harm, but his involvement would be great, and he might not be able to trade in Tibet.</p>
<p>The Outline of Kalimpong</p>
<p>Leaving Ma's house and walking into the market, there were many Tibetans coming and going, and the customs and habits were mostly Tibetanized. Each house has several flagpoles in front of it, with a long banner hanging from top to bottom. It is said that the flags are printed with Buddhist scriptures, and when the wind blows, the sutra flags flutter, just like people reciting them every day. Therefore, wherever Tibetans live, that's where they are.</p>
<p>There are not many Indians here, only a few large merchants are managed by Indians. Kalimpong originally belonged to Sikkim, a tributary state of Tibet. There are many Nepalese and Bhutanese natives in the city. The people are similar to our Chinese people, but their clothes are strange. Women all wear long skirts, and men mostly wear nondescript suits, but the small hats they wear on their heads are similar to Chinese melon-skin hats, and the tops of the hats are also red, with flower patterns embroidered around the edges of the hats.</p>
<h3>A Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>Sometimes he would pick up Virgil and Xenophon's works to read for a few minutes, but soon he would return to Dr. Thorndike or Prosecutor French's works. Although he had been teaching diligently for many years, he was not a learned classical scholar: indeed, he thought that Latin and Greek were more important than what Lloyd George said. Although they were dead languages, an English gentleman should know some of their idioms. He liked the short comments in "The Times" (Thems) newspaper. They would often use some sentences he knew well. The number of people who understood these things was gradually decreasing, and he was still able to occupy a place among these people, which in his view was a secret and valuable bond: he felt that this was one of the main benefits that classical education contributed.</p>
<p>He lived in Mrs. Wickett's house in this way, quietly enjoying reading, talking, and reminiscing about these joys; he was old, his hair was white, and he was somewhat bald, but regardless of his age, he was still very active, drinking tea, receiving guests, and busy revising "Brookfield Enquires" for the next publication, writing rare letters in fine, spider-like, and very clear handwriting. He invited new teachers and students to tea. There were two new teachers this autumn semester, and after they visited him, when they came out, one of them criticized him, saying: "This old boy can be considered a character, right? If there are indeed bachelors, his fussy way of making tea is a true bachelor."</p>
<p>This criticism was in fact completely wrong; because Chips was not a bachelor at all, he had been married, although it had been so long that none of the Brookfield faculty could remember his wife.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The fire was so warm and the tea was so fragrant that he was stimulated, and past events appeared vividly in his mind. Spring—one day in the spring of 1896. He was forty-eight years old—this was the age when permanent habits began to show. He had just been appointed as housemaster; while holding this position, he taught classical subjects, creating a warm and busy life for himself. During the summer vacation, he and his colleague Rowden went to the Lake District; they walked, climbed mountains, and played for a week, and Rowden left for family affairs. Chips lived alone in Wasdale Head, boarding in a small farmhouse. (8)</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Social Service</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ximing, A Seventy-Five-Year-Old</p>
<p>Social service is a righteous undertaking of mankind, and it is the obligation of the entire nation. Ximing expresses great sympathy and is willing to be a pioneer. Although I am not an experienced old horse, I am preparing to purchase horses in Yantai. Although old, I am unwilling to lag behind. Social service helps everyone, and everyone helps Ximing. I am the founder of the Failed Elderly Association and the initiator of the new Elderly Association. Now, with the elderly as the head, illness, loneliness, and poverty are subordinate to the three major departments governed by the elderly, managed and developed by the elderly, bringing great benefits. Such as: eliminating religious opinions, uniting mankind for mutual cooperation, dividing the grading system, and establishing educational mentors.</p>
<p>Confucius said that the old should be at peace and the young should be cared for; Buddha said birth, old age, sickness, and death; Jesus loves children and treats the elderly as parents. It can be seen that the eyes of religious figures are equal to the old and the young, and suitable for both old and young. People only pay attention to young children, often neglecting the aspirations of old age. People like Ma Xiangbo, like With Dengbu, become richer in old age. Now we eliminate religious factions, promote the unity of our people, unite mankind into a group, and seek social equality.</p>
<p>People have different endowments and different temperaments. The desire for goodness and survival is mostly the same, especially among the elderly. It is a pity to squeeze them out of society. Leaving aside the wealth and learning of the elderly, even their experience and knowledge still have some special strengths that can assist the community. How can we judge qualifications based on wealth and position and select talents based on success or failure? If people like Jiang Shang and Liang Hao died in ditches at their age, how sad would that be? It is especially regrettable that the elderly are willing to abandon themselves, live in seclusion, and proclaim their nobility.</p>
<p>The pain of life is divided into four parts. According to the words of Confucius and the Buddha, old age comes first, leading the three vulnerable parts of illness, loneliness, and poverty to the road of prosperity. The sick, orphans, and the poor all need mutual assistance. If we talk about old gentlemen, there is no lack of people with the heart and ability to help others. If Chen died at eighty-seven, Shen Enfu at eighty, Gao Huangchi at eighty, Xu Qianlao, Ding Fubao, Wen Lantting, etc., have a heart to save the world and take on the responsibility of helping the weak. If they can form a "Senior Citizens Association," imitating the norms of the YMCA, to serve the community, then the elderly in the community will have a Senior Citizens Association fellowship, and the adults will have a YMCA group. Both parties will advance together, old and young will return to the same place. Just like a two-wheeled car and two-winged birds, soaring straight up, what difficulty is there in a promising future? I am willing to do my best!</p>
<p>There are people, land, and wealth, the training of reproduction, food gathering, and the source of wealth. We are not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality. In our society, there are many who争利, and few who create利. It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Now, if we want to save society and bless the people, we must teach and cultivate together, and have both food and strength. This is the fundamental way to save. Using work as relief and救荒是善政; using education as a method is the best policy to relieve poverty. Teaching honesty, teaching thrift, teaching skills, if you want to fill your stomach, first work hard with your hands and feet. If your hands and feet are diligent, production will be abundant. It is not sitting and eating mountains empty, nor is it unearned income. The mentors who save production rely on old farmers, old gardeners, and old Confucian scholars. The elderly are not abandoned talents. We can use the elderly! Good! Good! I am waiting for an auction to sell, standing out!</p>
<p>The above words are the first step to 感動应声. I am more willing to dedicate my remaining years to Wang Cheng, the great cause of social service. Request for relief: poverty and disease, health, occupation, reading and lectures, old age and peace, and the care of young children, eight numbers.</p>
<h3>Tianguang Primary School Enrolls Free Students</h3>
<p>Opposite the Lujiabang Police Station in Nanshi, Tianguang Free Primary School has strict teaching management, spacious school buildings, excellent teachers, tuition-free herding, and full-day classes. Now, in order to popularize education, we are setting up one first-grade class and one fifth-grade class, enrolling new students and transfer students from all grades.</p>
<h3>China Benevolent Children's Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Poor Children</h3>
<p>The China Benevolent Children's Association has received over 80,000 yuan in donations for winter clothing for poor children, demonstrating the enthusiasm of all sectors of society for protecting children. The first batch of winter clothing has been completed, each set worth 30 yuan. Now, because the weather has been very cold for several days, poor children are asking for winter clothing. After approval, parents are successively going to the association to receive them, which is very active. In order to widely distribute winter clothing, in addition to entrusting members of the Pentecostal Holiness Church to go to the impoverished areas of Hongkou, Taopeng Road, Nanshi Xiaonanmen Qiaojia Road, Binbei Wenjianshi Road, the French Concession Xujia Lane, and Hed Road to investigate impoverished children and distribute them on a regular basis, the association has also sent letters to churches throughout the city to assist in investigating impoverished children in need of winter clothing, create name lists, and have the association coordinate the distribution.</p>
