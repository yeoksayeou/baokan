<h3 id="c1">歐局新動向 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>義大利首相墨索　尼氏，已於本月二十六日因病辭職，由義王愛麥虞限親攝義軍最高統帥職務，並仟命巴特里奧元帥繼任首相之職。同時，義王暨新首相分別對義國國民發出宣言，重申保土衛國決心，絕未變更旣定國策，期勉人民効忠。本來，戰時國家爲適應內外情勢，內閣局部改組，人事更新佈置，以期增强作戰力量，乃爲不足驚奇的事，况且這次墨氏之辭職，傳係健康關係，不欲貽誤嚴重局面，因作適當之更動，允屬尋常之舉。不過，我們對這事件發生後的一般趨勢，應該有正確的認識。尤其是本市市塲向來神經過敏，富於衝動性，好事者更流言訛傳，遂致人心浮燥，實爲庸人自擾之舉。於此，我們更應加以正確闡釋的必要。</p>
<p>第一，我們先得指出，在墨索甩尼氏提出辭職之前一星期，即本月十九日，曾赴義大利北部某鎭會晤德國希特勒元首，據德國官方宣稱：「曾討論軍事問題」，「檢討局勢，並權衡時局所需要之措施，而有所協定。」（二十日柏林中央社急電）同日海通社更曾明白指出希墨二氏會晤之意義稱：「希特勒及墨索里尼此次會議，係在軍事倥惚之時舉行，軸心國之政治領袖，同時亦爲軍事統帥，故彼等之共同檢討軍事，爲勢所必然。此種局勢，適逢東綫劇戰及英美之進攻西西里島，東綫與西綫同將決定歐洲之命運，義國之將來，將由地中海決定，與德國之將來，將由東錢決定，毫無二致，故與西綫之戰略，有密切之關係。西戰綫之敵人，正驅其全部軍隊，欲置足於軸心之境內，故希墨二氏不能不作現實之檢討。此次會議，必能爲勝利準備路徑焉。」觀乎此，可見墨氏之辭職，爲希墨會談中的決定事項而見之實行的第一件，這一事件，完全是爲了適應東西兩綫新戰局而採取的必要措置，因此，我們可以斷言：（一）由於此舉，義大利的戰綫必更整齊與有力，足以應付當面之敵，以全力支持及反擊西綫戰爭；義國內外問題可以尋求更適當的解決。（二）義國抗戰決心愈堅定，內部愈團結，同時對德協力亦必愈緊密，以切實推行此次希墨二氏會議的決定。</p>
<p>第二，我們要知道，目前的歐洲戰局，東綫的德蘇之戰與西綫的地中海之戰，雖均重要，但實際上，兩者比較，德蘇戰爭始終爲默洲重心所在。據最近電訊，蘇聯正在悉舉全國之力，不惜弧注一擲，以圖推行其反攻，空前大規模的決戰，方在開始。軸心國爲了顧及全局，以遠大的眼光，盱衡時勢，必須重視現實。爭取主動地位，以謀機先。因此，在軍事上，東綫是以「吸血戰略」「消耗戰」爲主，策動敵方的「被動攻勢」而達到其目的，在西綫方面，自本月上旬末以來，軸心軍始終沒有對於向西西里島登陸的英美軍展開主力的眞正的戰鬥，一方面誘引敵軍深入東北山岳地帶，以便加倍給以消耗，一方面更策劃給敵人以更重大的打擊，其最値得注視的一點，即是除了軍事的以外，更著力於政治。我們今日巳可指出，墨索里尼氏之辭職，無疑的，是一週前希墨二氏會談中答覆政治攻勢的第一步表現。</p>
<p>第三，德義軸心之團結，數年以來，不僅在軍事，政治，經濟上業巳結成一元化，即精神上也巳混凝合一。何况在歐洲大陸，兩國之間，實巳打成一片，攻守同盟，任令敵人謠言如何披猖，也不復有動搖團結的可能。我們觀乎墨氏辭職後，繼任者之明白宣示，絕無絲毫痕隙可見，更足證明軸心前途的趨勢明朗。</p>
<p>上述三點，可以看到墨索里尼氏之辭職一事，完全是軸心國有計劃地針對敵人的行動，是軍事以外的最有力的政治攻勢答覆之開端。在我們東方，則允當認淸任何敵性的謠言，力持鎮靜，加强軸心團結必勝的信心，特別注力於打擊英美方面任何新的企圖與蠢動，今日友邦日本在太平洋上及東亞大陸上，確保優勢。對於歐洲，也形成最有力的一翼，大家應從遠大處着眼，才會得到正確的結論。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日政府開定例閣議　密切注視義政局　義使奉命聲明作戰方針不變　巴特里奧與德大使繼續會談 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日重光外相於二十七日政府召開定例閣議時，曾詳細報告義大利之改變及歐州一般情勢，並與各閣員交換意見。下午四時半復在外相官邸接見義駐日大使，交換情報、並作種種懇談，刻日政府對壘索里尼首相辭職後義國政情之發展，正以極愼重之態度密切注視。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　義駐日大使印德里，二十七日下午四時半往訪日重光外相，根據本國政府訓令，正式通知日政府，墨索里尼辭去首相後，義政府對於戰爭之政策即三國共同貫澈戰爭之方針，並不有何變化。並表示義國對戰爭之堅强決心、更就當前戰局交換意見、舉行重要談話、歷一小時餘始辭去。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　據瑞典報之百倫消息稱：雜大利新首相巴特里奧元帥與德駐義大使麥根遜在羅馬之會談，仍在無間斷繼續中，關於會談結果之公報，將於最近在羅馬發表。</p>
<h3 id="c3">墨索裏尼辭職　起因於內政　德外部發言人之談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　德外部發言人施密特博士，昨午就墨索里尼辭職後之國際情勢答記者團之質問，茲錄德國新聞社所傳內容如次：施密特博士會日記者團時，巳闡明德政府之立塲，德國民對此新事態、絕對保持鎭靜。施密特博士特別指出義干及新首相於此次佈告中：已表明義政府決繼續戰爭，並謂義政局之發展，顯係起因於內政方面，故現在不能自外交方面加以判晰。記者團方面曾宣問謂：義國此次之政變是吾將影響軸心相互間之關係，施密特博士再引證義王及巴特里輿首相之佈告、巳明白表明軸心方面共同推行戰爭之決意。又記者團曾提出「墨索里尼首相辭職與最近希特勒。墨索里尼會談是否有關」之質問，施博士則謂：「此種卿測毫無根據」，最後博士對記者團之質問作一概括囘答謂：「根據現在所收情報，巳判明反軸心陣營對義國政變之論調完全錯誤」。又德報今晨力言、羅馬官方已聲明義大利將依舊効忠於軸心，並將繼續作戰，且德人亦自知德國之實力、足以獲得戰事之勝利。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　墨索里尼首相辭織之消息、予德國國民相當注目，且已感到事件之重大，衆謂：由於巴特里奧元帥之繼任首相，掌握全權及法西斯國民軍之改編，義政府王體今後或將由法西斯黨而移轉於軍部。惟據消息靈通方而觀察，謂新內閣之爲軍部內閣，無靑謂爲「專門家內閣」，德國官民現正注視其事態之發展。</p>
<p>其他各方引起反響</p>
<p>梵蒂岡　梵蒂岡二十七日中央社電　巴特里奧元帥受任命之消息。在羅馬傳出後，大　民衆即於夜半左右，集合於聖彼得方塲，作同情於教皇之示威運動，此次事件之重要、足以決定羅馬之存亡問題，但梵蒂岡內部之生活，仍照常不受影響，僅外交活動較平時稍爲活躍，</p>
<p>土耳其　安加拉二十六日中央社電　土京政界對義政府之更迭，暫時不加評論，靜候未來之發展。此間意見以爲：西西里之抗戰，即表明義大利在新政府領導之下，亦不欲不經抗戰無條件將國家交與敵人。土耳其報紙，對巴特里奧元帥宣言中所云，將繼續作戰一語，更爲重視。</p>
<p>西班牙　馬德里二十七日中央社電　西班牙公衆，對墨索里尼之辭職，深爲感動，但官方尙未加以評論。</p>

<p>第二日（十五日）</p>
<p>十五日午前八時起，四委員會分別開會討論各組提案。第一委員會由挾間茂爲主席，討論關於決戰精神的諸問題。第二委員會由鄉古　爲主席，討論關於增強戰力諸問題，第三委員會由織田信恒爲主席，討論關於食糧增產，國內自給諸問題，第四委員會由船田中爲全席，討論關於徹底實行決戰生活諸問題。四委員會全日聞會討論，午前八時四十分左右，束條首相於政務繁忙中抽暇巡視各委員會，靜聽議員之發言，小泉厚生相，安藤內相，山崎農相亦依决出席各委員會聆取並答覆各議員之發言。時東京一帶適在舉行防空訓練，大政翼贊會防護團　佈脅塲內外，以備萬一。會塲空氣，極爲緊張。茲將第二日谷委員會開會之情形摘錄於后：</p>
<p>第一委員會：第一部份主要提案如動員學者作學術的討論硏究並注重實踐案、展開擊滅敵人的大精神運動案，再現元寇精神案，復活祖先遺風案，普及二宮尊德精神案等，由文部省藤野總務局長，內務省飯沿神祗院副總裁等各說明當局的卞針，今後的施策上將儘量採納上開各案中的建議，繼由陸軍省宮本中佐致詞希望協力推進決戰生活。翼贊會本部石黑練成局長說明本部對各提案的方針。產業報國會町田實踐局長對產業報國運動作具體的說明之後，主席再要求提案以外的人發言，由八角三郎氏聲述生產增强上養成公員的重要，小泉六一氏全張使上下明瞭戰局的眞相爲昂揚決戰思想的根本問題，山田孝雄氏主張應斷然排斥泱戰階上因局部勝負而一喜一憂的現象，一億國民應堅具最後勝利的決心，宮崎，靑木二氏提議創作　滅英美歌曲，風靡國內以提高決戰精神，對此，由武藤情報局第一部長答稱因戰爭性質的不同而政府秘匿戰局眞相的苦衷，至此，第一部提案的討論遂告竣事。</p>
<p>第二部提案，關於官民協力並國民指　事項，其主要提案如：設置獨立靑年學校，强化靑年學校教育案，實施女子靑年學校義務制案，以職業教育爲重心以謀技術的向上案，努力養成優良教員案，在各地設置女子的專任指導者案，由國家管理勤勞靑少年教育案。女子靑年學校實施軍事教育案。中等學校與靑年學校一元化案。强化國民學校教育案等。經由朝此奈　太耶氏（日本靑少年團副團長）希望女子自　的組織勤報國家，並希　社會　勤勞女子靑年提高其尊敬的觀念。對此，由武井厚生次官答稱：在目前狀態下，男子學生的動員固應更加强化，女子勤勞者亦應如此。於此所應注意的是徵用問題。徵用固然是勞務上最容易的方法，但在精神方面的影響實極重大，因此，當局盡全力避免徵用方式，使國民自動的發露勤勞報國精神，藤野文部省總務局聲稱：學生動員計劃要網業已實施，關于女學生的動員，亦希望充分參酌各人意見，在今後的施策上加以採納。</p>
<p>第二委員會：關于增强戰力生產問題，政府人員的答辯如商工省豐田企業局長稱：因企業整備而有不及格的勤勞者時，將再加以訓練，或使作製造軍需品的輕便工作。厚生省中村勤勞局長稱：關于徵用問題，目下正在準備一種銓衡方針，本會議中有關該問題的意見，將充分予以考慮採納。繼由陸軍省佐藤戰備課長說明關于企業整備上陸軍之積極的協力，並軍部對於重工業部門上之具體的方針。企畫院平井調查官稱：一，此次企業整備的結果，菲重要部門剩餘的工人將使之把最小限的設備作最大限的活用，以維持國民生活，生產最低限度的必要物資。二，關于企業整備，應極明確地判明責任的所在。</p>
<p>午後的第二委員會中關于勞力的問題，企劃院山口課長答稱：一，贊成設置國民的產業預備隊，二，贊成微用學生問題，但應對學校的種類應加以區分。三，支付工資之最適切形態，目前正與有關各省密切聯絡硏究中。西，勤勞者的物資配給制，即將實現，五，設定標準能率問題，視實際情形而決定。</p>
<p>關于國民動員事項、兒玉九十氏（明星中學校長希望從速實施學生動員要綱。</p>
<p>女子動員隨着時局的緊張而重要起來，爲目前緊要問題之一，羽仁說子氏（東京自由學校教授）的動員有教育的女性案，村岡花子氏（東京日本婦女協會理事，的對於母性心身二面的留意案，桐淵氏（全國友之會的中央委員）的鄰舍主婦的動員案，山高氏（日婦理事）的關於徵用女子案，對此重大問題的解決均提出了値得注意的見解。</p>
<p>第三委員會：政府對於決戰時期食糧增產的諸種應急的及永久的對策，唯有在農村團結穩固之後，始能發揮實效。此點有關於農村指導層及指導方法的强化。第三委員會關於食糧問題，有許多寳貴的意見，有從地主層的指導力與任務立論，有從確立農村教育方針立論，有從農村指導之綜合的推進策立論，有從農村精神與農業技術的兼顯立論，有從農村的部落制度立論。關於農業增產的方針，各議員各就專門的立塲陳述調整供求方針，農林省之適時重點的指導實爲要務。</p>
<p>午後，會議續開，討論食糧增產上成爲最直接的障害的農業技術、肥料，勞力缺乏等諸問題。先就技術關係而言，跟着教近重工業的發展而增加的兼業農家，其收獲量極爲低下，應用何法確保農村的機構？是爲農業技術指導的急務。對於確立農忙期的非常勞力動員問題，在村鎭以村長鎭長爲委員長，設置食　國內自給增產委員會，以爲調整勞力供求的關係，委員長賦與勞力徵用　，實行計劃配置。此外、從綜合食　政策的觀點，與增產甘藷有深切關係的提高價格運出境外的配給委由地方長官處理等、石黑農林决官對此諸問題的答辯稱：</p>
<p>一·兼業農家的漸增，從今日的實情看來，是不得已的狀態。政府正在極力實施創立自耕農等方針。</p>
<p>一·肥料在前次會議中與五大重要產業同樣看待，政府正在設法以期確保，而堆肥運動目前亦正在實施中，兩者相輔而行，始能打破現狀。</p>
<p>一·甘藷的重要性自在考慮中，尤以貯藏所的設置，將與本年甘藷，馬鈴薯會社再出發同時並進。運輸方面亦與鐵道省取得密切聯絡</p>
<p>最後翼壯本部河野部長對於委員會始終以懇摯且建設的意見熱誠討論之事稱：委員會的成果，本會亦正在積極準備立即實施，不限於農村，即在國民運動的昂揚上，亦應克服種種惡劣條件，以完成食糧增產，於午後五時半故會。（翼）</p>

<p>爲着　展天主教的文化事業，他們除了印刷所之外，另設有「發行所」，分裝訂和販賣兩部與印刷所工塲相連，設備電動的吸墨，擢紙，切紙，　綫，裝訂，上漿，裱裝，燙金等各種　式機器，承接各具委託裝幀的文件，無論爲報章，雜誌，經典，書籍，文稿，無論爲中式綫裝，西式布包皮脊，式　色彩都可任　選擇，發行所的陳列櫃臺，滿是整齊富麗的裝訂完工書籍，具有使人依戀的魅力。販賣部方面，凡該院出品如聖像，經文，中西圖書，各式簿據，無不　有　有，並且代售各省天主堂書籍雜誌等，雖然他們不以營利爲目標，但是對於顧容之熱情招待，在今日上　已經不易遇到的了。</p>
<p>對於宗教文化，同樣具有重要貢獻的，是該院附設的攝影製版部，包括攝影，影印，定製銅鋅版各部份，機械設備，雖然不是最新式的，但尙稱完管，壁架上堆積如山的製成品，正可表示該部過去的成績，不過，由於地位關係，攝彩及製版二者，主要的服務對象，似乎還是幾家教堂和教友，以及與宗教有關的印刷業者。</p>

<p>關於物價統制之原理，筆者曾於民國三十一年初誌其大要，就目前情勢　之，除非採取嚴竣行動，則本市物價統制工作，將告無效。吾人曾否念及倘容物價繼續昂騰，則社會及經濟方而，在數月或一年後。所受之反響爲　如耶。現在每月數萬市民之薪資，橄爲更高之生活費所超越。</p>
<p>筆者在前文中曾指出，凡華中出產，足以自給之主要物資，如米，麵粉及棉花等：均可穩定其價格，此項主要物資，應與非主要物資有所區別，非主要物資有奢侈品，舶來品，以及不能補充之物品，因貨稀之故，以致售價特別昂貴。</p>
<p>穩定物價須訂立一確定之物資交易比率，例如米與棉織品之間，六年前米一擔之交易價值，與布一疋相等，目前應訂定同　之交易價值比率，以穩定價格、並便利生產。</p>
<p>現已證明欲達穩定物價之目的，任何緩和策略均無補於實，故下列嚴厲策略，乃穩定物價之唯一成功方法，亦爲安定民生之絕對必要條件。此種策略，應即同時推行，一方　使供給或出產量增加，另一方面則使需求或消耗量减少。</p>
<p>（甲）增加可以獲得之主要物資供給或增加生產：</p>
<p>（一）以公允價格向目前貨主收買全部主要物資，冉按成木價格配給民衆。</p>
<p>（二）確定主要物資之平準價格，使消費者得享受平價利益。同時對於生產者不致有價格過低之虞，藉以鼓勵其繼續生產。</p>
<p>（三）將資金及人力　用於僅從事製造主要物資之事業上。　（乙）减少需求或消耗量：</p>
<p>（一）各種放款祗限於製造主要物資之事業。</p>
<p>（二）限制食糧消耗。</p>
<p>（三）實行全面配給，使主要物資祗可憑票購買，票上註明代表各種物資之點數。</p>
<p>實則凡銀行錢莊及信託公司等，對於主要事業之貸款、倘能嚴加限制，並拒絕放款予從事投機之事業，則物價水準，殆祗達今日之　份而已。銀行錢莊及信託公司之貸款名單，應即予以監察。同時所有非主要及非實業之組織　個人貸款，須立即收回，凡銀公司之活動應即加以檢查，設此類公司非致力生產事業而從事投機者，並應勒令停閉。</p>
<p>實行此稱步驟之迅速效果，常使物價下降，結果非循求供正軌，而僅憑印象及膨脹需求所造成之虛構價値，亦得消除。</p>
<p>同時希望糧食供給管理當局能了解糧食供給不斷之極端重要性，而能按照計口授糧計劃，如期供給，否則發生停滯或中斷情事，當使物價再受嚴重之反響也。</p>

<p>本市新運分會，因鑒於一般市民對水國國旗之懸掛方法，殊少注意，且對於國旗之尊敬與愛護，更詳認識。値此厲行新運之際，自戀規定懸掛方法及敬愛辦法，故特訂定須知一份，俾本市民衆團體及商號一致遵照。並悉該會於八月一日至三日，並將派員分別實地糾正。該須知原文如左：</p>
<p>（甲）國旗縣持法</p>
<p>（一）全旗　全旗是慶祝的意思，如遇國家慶典及平日各處所縣之國旗皆謂之全旗，其懸旗方法有二：（一）有直立旗桿者，升旗時先將國旗靠左上下二角繫於旗桿繩上，或以旗繩穿入旗管內，兩端繫牢，徐徐升至桿頂，降時也須徐徐降下。（二）無直立旗桿者、先將國旗掛於旗桿上　如係單旗，須懸在門之左上方成仰角四十百度，但必須將旗之全部露於門外。如係　旗，則交叉縣於門之正中。</p>
<p>（二）半旗　如遇國恥紀念或革命先烈國家元勳的一喪節，應懸掛半旗，以示哀悼。其縣掛方法有二：（一）有直立旗桿者，先將國旗升至桿頂，然後降至全桿三分之一（短旗桿可降至四分之一），降旗時亦要先將國旗升至桿頂，然後徐徐降下。（二）無直立旗杯者，先將國旗掛於旗桿三分之一處（短桿四分之一），然後縣於門之左上方，旗桿仍成仰角四十五度。</p>
<p>（乙）尊敬和受護</p>
<p>（一）對國旗行禮時，須十分莊嚴。（二）升降旗時，須立正致敬，兩巨注視國旗。於進行時，遇到升降旗，亦須立正致敬。國旗升降完畢後，方可繼續行進。（三）遇有破壞或侮辱國旗時，應儘力保護、並對破壞或侮辱國旅者，予以嚴厲處分。（四）如遇友邦升降旗時，亦應致敬以示友誼，（五）國旗破壞，不可綴補，亦不可任意拋棄或作別用，應折成布條或用火焚化，（六）無論任何塲地，如見有拋棄之國旗。應立即拾起。（七）升旗時縛旗的結，務須牢固，不可中途脫落。（八）升旗應在上午日出後，降旗應在下午日落　。遇有風雨雪霧之日，除別有規定外，不應將國旗飄揚天空。</p>

<p>主力大戰</p>
<p>正塲爲聯誼決鬥聖葡猶，聯誼乃全滬華人代表隊，聖葡猶係聖芳濟葡萄牙猶太三隊精華集合而成滬上諸傑出人材，均搜羅殆盡、不啻爲西聯隊之變相。該隊欲湔雪前恥，特向聯誼挑戰，志在報復前仇。昨在猶太總會召集聖芳濟之福恩，葡萄牙之維克泰，猶太之瑪亞三大巨頭問小組會議，檢付應付方針，費時達四小時。陳容除上决原有人馬外，增請猶太瑪亞·法凡笑·柯恩三員，猛將助陣。聯誼亦嚴陣以待　漢近來球藝登峯造　。六生駐顏有術，仍能保　全盛時代之　勢。與大刀闊斧之張材根匹　可稱珠聯璧合宋靈聖病已痊愈。瞿永福球藝猛晋，與鄭英權輔助前符。前鋒綫李義臣發誓改性，發奮圖强。孫錦順老當益壯，與血氣方剛之高保正聯合衝鋒陷陣。兩翼　用吳祺祥費春華，乃有計劃之配置。中西兩隊以實力觀察，西隊較遜一籌。球藝評論，西隊駕乎其上。聯誼以聯絡勝人，聖葡猶之長力及忍耐性，聯誼將受重大威脅。屆時相遇鹿死誰手，殊難預測。門票售普通三十元及對號座五十元，以前二戰，所發出之入塲券，今日一律無效。觀衆搭車，法租界二十二路公共汽車及法商二路電車，均可直達球塲，</p>

<p>最近上海新聞聯合會發起節的運動週，希望由此能夠喚起滬上數百萬市民的注意，自動地實行戰時節約生活，撙節物實消耗，協助物價平抑，促進民生安定，可算得是一個盛舉。</p>
<p>不過節約運動似可分做兩種：第一爲物質方面的節約運動，第二爲精神方面的節約運動；前者是狹義的節約，而後者爲廣義的節的；　義的物質的節約固然重要，而廣義的精神的節約允屬要緊。</p>
<p>例如明未淸初顧亭林先生一生行已有恥，實是求是，不作數衍事，不說門面話，每天早睡早起，任何人請他吃飯，必於日落前歸家，以爲「天下除私奔盜竊兩種人焉有正人君子而夜行者。」這就是亭林先生進一步的精神節的生活，故其壽高至六十九歲，（生於西紀一六一三年卒於一六八一年）。</p>
<p>高壽爲人人所希望，而高壽的最重要先決條件爲隨時節約精神，尤其是靑年時代的節的精神减少物慾。假使滬上居民能推廣節的運動的意義，大家能如亭林先生之早出早歸，早起早睡，淸心算愁，則物質上的節的後果，必能因而達到更加不可思議的美滿程度。</p>

<p>白茅無辜  葉克文　　前幾天，溫度驟然昇到華氏八十多度，在這樣溫暖的季節中似乎是不大有的事。於是人們都感到有些熱不可當；向來高踞在五樓的我們底敎室是沒有人來的，但這幾天却成爲一般人的納凉所在。尤其是女學生們，她們肩並肩，手挽手，三三兩兩地在走廊底一角閒談着·私語着·笑謔着，……微風傳來了校園裏的荷花香，偶而還夾帶着她們底戲要追逐底笑聲。　　我們的「藍衣詩人」——這是我們給一位穿藍衣而愛好詩文的同學底尊稱——這兩天似乎交上了嬉笑運，每次見到他從樓下走上來時總是笑嬉嬉的。問他笑的什麽，他準又會笑嬉嬉地搖搖龐大底腦袋，聳聳瘦削的肩囘答：「不在笑什麽，我說」人是有情感的動物」，這果然不錯啊！」　　據阿Q第二告訴我，詩人近來看中一年級裏的一個女生，就是每天跳跳奔奔到五樓來的那　女生——高鼻子·架眼鏡，而且是個很淘氣的女孩子　　詩人曾幾次向同學問她的名字，可是誰都不知道，於是他便常常借故徘徊在點名册旁，反覆地看着一年級裏的名册，但總又是搔搔頭，嘆口氣退了出來。此後詩人衹得屈身和校役們攀談起來，從校中的每一件瑣事爲出發點，終點總還仍舊是她。「喂，老二，這兩天一年級裏的那個披着長髪，穿絳色短大衣的女生是誰呀？新來的嗎，怎麽　上學期沒有見到她？」　　「她嗎，叫王倩，是新來的。」老二緊瞇着細眼狡猾地笑着：「她是挺用功的，小心別將人帶壞了。」　　詩人瘦了，害噪使他亳無發展地苦渡了一星期　　厄運終於降臨到我們的詩人身上。是一個明媚的上午，陽光暖和地照撫着大地，凉爽的晨風陣陣吹拂着人們，鳥兒宛囀地在枝頭鳴着；校園裏送來了陣陣的花草的香息。一個綠衣人走近校門，遞　了一封信。上面署着：　　E路六四七三號　　啓人大學一年級　　王　倩小姐玉展　　內詳　　這封信在她拆閱之下，她開始被羞恨支配了全神經，於是恨恨地將這封「肉麻」的情書公開交給了級長。　　這是一封普通的情書，所奇的信內的署名却是「藍衣人」，而且信上所寫的通訊處也正是我們詩人底庽所。　　詩人開始陷入了痛苦的境地，可是他並不能阻止這些無稽的謠言和無理的攻擊。　　第二天，我們向不缺席的詩人突然不來上課了。十時左右，校役遞給我一封信，不消說就知道是詩人　來的，我急速地抽開來一看：　　弈君：請你將這封信轉致給各位同學。　　親愛的同學們：因了嬉笑的原因，終於給帶來了可悲的後果，我不擅辭令，所以我在無辜的誣陷來臨以後，竟會面紅耳赤地不知所措，况且這次的事情更使我蒙受着更大的刺激。我知道：即　是世界上最會辯論的人也難使這件事亳不涉及我，何况我又是個不善言語的人呢！　　我能將我的人格來擔保——我決不會幹那種卑鄙的舉動的！也許是同學們底作弄吧！但這惡作劇似乎是太過分些了。阿龍的毀滅  東方　　阿龍是某公司時裝部的一個小職員，由練習生勤懇工作了五個年頭，才巴結到這一隻飯碗。人挺和氣，很得主任的信任，若能好好的幹·前途是很有希望的。拿五百多塊錢一個月養活一家三口，雖不寬舒，但苦日子是可以過的。這次領到薪水，想買一頂草帽，但一算却實在提不出這筆數十元額外的費　。然而，不是可以想別的法子麽？但他却想到了賭博，想從　　贏些錢來買一頂帽子，並和妻子有一次電影，和買一些吃的潤潤枯腸。　　他懷着僥倖和希望心走進賭塲，先是小心地下注，眼見自己袋裏的錢漸漸地减少了，他感到了失望，並且發了急，漸漸地有些昏迷了，只知把鈔票一捲捲向台上擲，輸完了所有的錢。　　「了不得，怎麽辦呢？唉！」是悔恨懊喪的歎息。「尋死去吧？不，犯不着！只有想法子弄些錢，再去翻本，碰一下運氣。」　　他囘到家裏，晚飯也不吃，坐在床上發呆，想着怎樣設法弄得這一筆錢。借是借不到，同事朋友們都是貧「血」症患者，和自己一樣的常常捉襟見肘，要想問他們借錢，比牽駝駱過　　還難。只有把衣服拿去當一下，只要能夠翻本，馬上就可以去贖出來，或者還可以贏一些呢！於是，也不和妻子商量，拿了自己的一件皮袍子和妻的一件駱駝絨旗袍，當了四百元，走進賭塲就滲出了一身冷汗。　　一次，二次的敎訓不能使阿龍死了這條心。他心裏以爲自己的運道不致這麽壞，難道會一次一次的輸下去，他漸漸地沉湎於賭塲之中。他不聽妻子的苦諫，親友的勸告；不顧一家的死活，他當光了自己和妻子的衣服和家中所有的稍爲値錢的東西。有時，他確贏了一些，但他不去把衣服東西贖出來，而要留着做下次的賭本；有的，贖出來後不數日又送進了當舖。他辦事也沒有心思了，常常遲到和早退。親戚們見了他頭痛，因爲他常常向他們借錢。漸漸地，時裝部的主任對他生了疑心。　　一天，阿龍輸完了所有的錢，家中也沒有再可當錢的東西，而這一次的房租，米，煤的錢又沒有着落，親戚處欠的債也得還，當去的衣服東西也是一筆不小的數目。他感到前途的　暗，渺茫，他感到人生的乏味，他想自殺，但覺得對不起人，對不起自己的妻子和孩子。他絞盡腦汁，想不出補救的辦法。突然，一個意念襲入他腦子裏：「把公司裏的衣服借來用一用吧！只要稍爲贏一些，可以趕緊贖出來歸還，好在一會兒工夫，誰也不會知道的，」但他却沒有想到，要是輸去了又將如何？次日，他偷偷地取了顧客定製而尚未取去的二　　衣，正用紙　包好預備拿走的時候，却被主任發現了他的偷竊行爲。　　飯碗打破了！沒吃官司還算運氣！　　由公司裏出來，阿龍猶如受傷的野獸，拖着沉重的雙足。過去的一切湧上了心頭，妻子的苦諫，親友的勸告，沒有賭博以前的融融洽洽的家庭和安定的生活……悔，恨，悲，憤，　集在阿龍的心頭，他感到猛烈的良心的自疚。他沒有面目囘家見妻子的愁苦的臉，聽孩子天眞的叫喚聲，他感覺一切都完了。賭博打破了他的飯碗，使他身敗名裂！　　次日淸晨，浦江中發現了阿龍的屍身，賭博完結了阿龍年輕的一生。在黑夜裡  戎希純　　我獨自摸索着前進，　　夜風從葉叢掠過，　　凄厲　聲音。　　恰像是梟鳥底悲鳴，　　天上沒有月，　　也沒有星，　　無邊的黑　　籠罩了漫長的途程，　　黑暗中，　　依舊是摸索着前進，　　四周是多末幽黯，　　而又是多末陰森，　　雖然，我明知道，　　凜冽的夜風，　　會凝結我的熱血；　　恐怖的黑暗，　　會挫折我的雄心，　　但，　　像神經麻木似的瘋子，　　不知道有凜冽，　　不知道有恐怖，　　却永遠是這樣摸索着，　　一息不息的，　　要在這　　黑沉沉的長夜裏，　　尋求出　　一綫晨曦的光明了！夢  張心鵑　　昨晚，我做了一個夢，一個美麗的夢。　　我夢見我的兩肩上長了翅膀，我鼓舞着它在蔚藍的蒼穹間翱翔。飛飛，我飛到一座巍峨的宮殿，輕輕地叩擊着幸福之門。後來我又邂逅一位美麗的安琪兒，她的身上披着薄絹，像蟬翼一樣，發着晚霞的光。　　一切都是綺麗的，奇幻的，我怅歡，欣喜；陶醉在那嚴然而甘芳的氤氳裏。　　突然，在朦朧中，一個靑面獠牙的巨靈，正伸着魔瓜向我疾攫。啊，多可怕呀！……我跨上一匹雪白的駿馬，執着一柄爍目的寳劍。寳劍的兩面各鐫着「理智」和「情感」四個字。我揮動它。對準魔爪砍去。劍光如閃電般使人怵目，心驚。……　　我聽見雲端上奏着琤琮的仙樂……。　　這是一個夢，一個美麗而又奇幻的夢。愛鳥之想  上路忠雄　　在小箱的一部開一小穴，掛在適當的樹木上，即可在內作巢，此之謂巢箱。　　不僅在華中，即以中國土地面積作比例而論，樹木數量稀少到庭可見，研討繁殖鳥類之原因，首先應考慮的即爲森林，在樹木稀少之處，備有巢箱設施，它的結果能幫助鳥類繁殖甚大，中國人大多愛鳥，但他們所愛的鳥常關閉在籠中，或　　它的足，我願愛鳥的人們認識眞正愛　的意義。　　愛鳥首要者是鳥籠，我們的鳥籠如天之高有地之廣，天地間之鳥類，都是我們所愛之鳥，愛自然者必爲自然所愛，人對鳥表示親切之感，鳥對人亦將報以好意，此點應爲人類所深見。　　森林內和草原中繁殖鳥類極多，但因經過春夏秋冬季節之轉變，刈取草木等原因，草原繁殖鳥類將無以爲生，人們以秋收爲樂，割取雜草時應當考　鳥類亦爲天之所生，若以空中所飛鳥類看作自己籠中所　養的鳥無異。於爲人爲鳥雙方，均一大幸事，而製作巢箱之意，當亦油然而生。如果巢箱運動普　華中全部，對於農村利益的收穫，當可想　一二。我人只用一空箱作巢箱，掛在附近樹上即可，生於其巢之鳥乃至於其死，對於人之恩意亦決不會忘。　　愛人之德者爲鳥，報人以恩者爲鳥，爲人們的利益打算，實施巢箱計劃，眞不可忽視。啊！潮汕急賑捐款徵信錄（第）號　　各行莊代收捐款　　富華銀行：合順祥一萬元，泰申棧五萬元，　泰保險公司五百元，　萬順申莊六千元，承　堂四千元，　記二萬五千元，　興二萬五千元，文茂四千元。　　紗業　行：吳永順集記一千元，茂豐八千元，王永康二萬元，同益善記各一千元，華成福二千元，郭伯威五千元，叔記一千元，致豐，協記各三千元，周勤就十五元，兆泰，王申甫，恒大紗號，益昌紗號，愛蓮堂周四戶各一萬元，振　昌紗號五千元，承興昌紗號，新泰昌紗號各三千元，大　豐號，隆順號各一千元，永　公，孫漢忱各二千元，鼎昌號一千元　　金康銀行：神紙箔　公會一千元。　　工業銀行：郭子芳二百元，岑蘇安五百元，協德　一百元，兪又庭二百元，德順盛四千元，協德堂一百元　　企業銀行：隆記五千元，鼎孚廠一千元，陳周氏一百元，郭雲棠二十元　　南洋商業銀行：新新公司二千元，永安公司一萬元，永安紡織公司，郭順各一萬元，李芳甫二千元，彭　慰一千元，郭禮安，郭啓棠，郭敬棠三戶各二千元，李捷　一千元　　漁業　行：永泰三百元，　含魯一百元，陳　　，陳人弟各二百元，　豐五十元，女　客九十元，　省堂，益記各五百元，保記二百元，　記五百元。　　　孚銀行：積記一千元，王芷亭二百元，盧瑞　五百元，成興發二千元，羅道樞五千元，王彬彥二百元，一記二千元，無名氏一千　百元，郭伯聲，福記各二千元，榮記，蕭子　各一萬元，郭良二萬元，郭集吾五百元，陳水鈦，　耀斌，周柏初，鄭增　各二百元，郭仁記　人，翁廷記，蕭蓮　各一千元，陳廷根，鄭耀銓，　子川，馬少飛，劉　新各五百元，程浮生二百元，　　山三百元，　　式一千五百元，陳述先五百元，　鳴岡一千五百元，　　玉二百元，許立平五百元，鍾其昌一千元，蔡孝廉二百元，　興，裕記各二千元，永豐，源餘各一千元，　昌五千元，褚　華二千元，　子　一千元，蕭煥文五百元，張朝平二千元，陳允中一千元，鄭松南二百元，隆昌，唐潤生各五百元，郭璿圻一千五百元，周贊文，周木泉各五百元，鄭毓記三百元，馬友如，郭作林各一千元，張昌曹四百元，周泰山一千元，紅大，　柏承各二百元，周文彬一千元，林友璋，王炳得，葉鐵英各二千元，鄭德坤；黃漢亭各五百元，周志川一千元，周潤　三千元，劉德奎，張松岩各五百元，朱寳山一萬元，陳國錚一千元，切削春連五百元，郭　盛二百元，　闌友一千元，吳汝梅，鄭池德各五百元，翁秉璋三百元，蕭子根一百元，鄭鞠秋，鄭紹昌，鄭　臣各二百元，鄭　寳，鄭二容各一百元，陳海臣五百元，陳炳勳，　十　各二百元，范康生一千元，陳錦源三百元，馬林靑一千元，毅茂記三千元，源和五千元，郭界夫，黃毓天，蕭少墀各一千元，鄭耕河二百元，陳俊——鄭炳烈各五百元，馬明初，倪文燈各一千元，袁　根三千元，陳吉亭，郭承明各一百元，唐祉生二千元，鄭子華五百元，郭泰欣二百元，蘇光全五百元，郭炳增二千元，郭　枝三百元，陳瑞芝三千元，合記一千元，大豐五百元，吳松根一千元，　兩一百元，申新二廠，振藝各一千元，劉沛，許梅友，周勤文，李　泰各五百元，蕭貴生二千元，姚德二百元，蔡振新二千元，鄭沙蓀一千五百元，鄭庭芝五千元，郭廷正二千元，郭無名氏五百元，茂記一萬元，連　和二百元，張續卿一千元，蕭　林一百元，徐昌春一萬元　郭慶　五千元</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Trends in the European Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini resigned on the 26th of this month due to illness. King Victor Emmanuel III has assumed the supreme command of the Italian military and appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as the new Prime Minister. Simultaneously, the King and the new Prime Minister issued declarations to the Italian people, reaffirming their determination to defend the country and stating that the established national policy remains unchanged. They encouraged the people to remain loyal. Originally, during wartime, partial cabinet reshuffles and personnel changes to strengthen combat power in response to internal and external situations are not surprising. Moreover, Mussolini's resignation is reportedly due to health reasons. He did not want to delay the serious situation and made appropriate changes, which is a normal move. However, we should have a correct understanding of the general trends after this event. In particular, the market in this city has always been nervous and impulsive, and troublemakers spread rumors, causing public anxiety, which is an unnecessary worry. Therefore, we need to give a correct explanation.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that a week before Mussolini's resignation, on the 19th of this month, he met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in a town in northern Italy. According to the German official announcement: "They discussed military issues," "Reviewed the situation, and weighed the measures required by the current situation, and reached an agreement." (Central News Agency Berlin urgent telegram on the 20th) On the same day, the Haitong News Agency clearly pointed out the significance of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, saying: "This meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was held during a military crisis. The political leaders of the Axis powers are also military commanders. Therefore, their joint review of military affairs is inevitable. This situation coincides with the fierce battle on the Eastern Front and the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily. The Eastern and Western Fronts will both determine the fate of Europe. The future of Italy will be determined by the Mediterranean, and the future of Germany will be determined by the Eastern Front, which is the same. Therefore, it has a close relationship with the strategy of the Western Front. The enemy on the Western Front is driving its entire army to set foot in the territory of the Axis powers. Therefore, Hitler and Mussolini must conduct a realistic review. This meeting will surely prepare the path for victory." From this, it can be seen that Mussolini's resignation was the first item decided in the Hitler-Mussolini talks and implemented. This event was entirely a necessary measure taken to adapt to the new battle situation on the Eastern and Western Fronts. Therefore, we can assert: (1) Due to this move, the Italian front will be more organized and powerful, enough to deal with the enemy at hand, to fully support and counterattack the Western Front war; Italian internal and external problems can seek more appropriate solutions. (2) Italy's determination to resist will be firmer, its internal unity will be stronger, and its cooperation with Germany will be closer, to effectively implement the decisions of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting.</p>
<p>Second, we must know that in the current European war situation, the German-Soviet war on the Eastern Front and the Mediterranean war on the Western Front are both important, but in fact, comparing the two, the German-Soviet war has always been the center of Europe. According to recent telegrams, the Soviet Union is using all its national strength, staking everything, to promote its counter-offensive. An unprecedented large-scale decisive battle is about to begin. In order to take care of the overall situation, the Axis powers must pay attention to reality with a long-term perspective and an overview of the situation. Strive for a proactive position to seek opportunities. Therefore, in military terms, the Eastern Front is dominated by "blood-sucking strategy" and "attrition warfare," instigating the enemy's "passive offensive" to achieve its goals. On the Western Front, since the end of the first ten days of this month, the Axis forces have never launched a major real battle against the Anglo-American forces landing in Sicily. On the one hand, they lured the enemy deep into the northeastern mountainous area, in order to give them double consumption, on the other hand, they planned to give the enemy a greater blow. The most noteworthy point is that in addition to military affairs, they also focused on politics. We can point out today that Mussolini's resignation is undoubtedly the first step in responding to the political offensive in the Hitler-Mussolini talks a week ago.</p>
<p>Third, the unity of the German-Italian Axis has been integrated not only militarily, politically, and economically for several years, but also spiritually. Moreover, in continental Europe, the two countries have already become one, an alliance of offense and defense. No matter how rampant enemy rumors are, it is no longer possible to shake the unity. We can see from the clear declaration of the successor after Mussolini's resignation that there is no trace of discord, which further proves that the trend of the Axis future is clear.</p>
<p>From the above three points, it can be seen that Mussolini's resignation is entirely a planned action by the Axis powers against the enemy's actions, and is the beginning of the most powerful political offensive response outside of military affairs. In our East, we should recognize any hostile rumors, maintain calm, strengthen the Axis' confidence in victory, and pay special attention to combating any new attempts and unrest from the British and American sides. Today, our friendly country Japan maintains an advantage in the Pacific and on the East Asian continent. It also forms the most powerful wing for Europe. Everyone should look at the big picture to get the right conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Government Holds Routine Cabinet Meeting, Closely Monitors Italian Political Situation, Italian Ambassador Ordered to Declare War Policy Unchanged, Badoglio Continues Talks with German Ambassador <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu reported in detail on the changes in Italy and the general situation in Europe at the routine cabinet meeting held by the government on the 27th, and exchanged views with the cabinet members. At 4:30 p.m., he received the Italian Ambassador to Japan at the Foreign Minister's official residence to exchange information and have various cordial talks. Currently, the Japanese government is closely monitoring the development of the Italian political situation after Prime Minister Mussolini's resignation with a very cautious attitude.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Indelli, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at 4:30 p.m. on the 27th. According to instructions from his home government, he formally notified the Japanese government that after Mussolini resigned as Prime Minister, the Italian government's policy on the war, namely the common policy of the three countries to carry out the war, has not changed in any way. He also expressed Italy's strong determination for the war, exchanged views on the current war situation, and held important talks for more than an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the Berlingske Tidende of Sweden, the talks between the new Italian Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio and the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, in Rome are continuing uninterrupted. A communique on the results of the talks will be released in Rome soon.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mussolini's Resignation Caused by Internal Affairs, Talk by German Foreign Ministry Spokesman <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - German Foreign Ministry spokesman Dr. Schmidt answered questions from reporters yesterday afternoon regarding the international situation after Mussolini's resignation. The contents transmitted by the German News Agency are recorded as follows: Dr. Schmidt clarified the German government's position to the reporters, and the German people maintained absolute calm on this new situation. Dr. Schmidt specifically pointed out that the Italian King and the new Prime Minister stated in the announcement that the Italian government is determined to continue the war, and said that the development of the Italian political situation is obviously caused by internal affairs. Therefore, it cannot be judged from the diplomatic aspect at present. The reporter group asked whether the political changes in Italy will affect the relationship between the Axis powers. Dr. Schmidt again cited the announcements of the Italian King and Prime Minister Badoglio, which clearly stated the Axis's determination to jointly promote the war. The reporter group also asked whether Mussolini's resignation was related to the recent Hitler-Mussolini talks. Dr. Schmidt said, "This kind of speculation has no basis." Finally, Dr. Schmidt gave a general answer to the reporter group's questions, saying, "According to the information received so far, it has been determined that the anti-Axis camp's views on the Italian political changes are completely wrong." German newspapers emphasized this morning that the Roman authorities have stated that Italy will remain loyal to the Axis and will continue to fight, and the Germans also know that Germany's strength is enough to win the war.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The news of Prime Minister Mussolini's resignation has attracted considerable attention from the German people, and they have felt the importance of the event. It is said that due to Marshal Badoglio's assumption of the post of Prime Minister, the exercise of full power, and the reorganization of the Fascist National Guard, the Italian government may shift from the Fascist Party to the military in the future. However, according to observations from well-informed sources, it is said that the new cabinet is not a military cabinet, but rather a "cabinet of experts." German officials and civilians are now watching the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Reactions from Other Parties</p>
<p>Vatican City - Vatican City, 27th (Central News Agency) - The news of Marshal Badoglio's appointment spread in Rome. Around midnight, the masses gathered in St. Peter's Square to show sympathy for the Pope. The importance of this incident is enough to determine the survival of Rome. However, life inside the Vatican remains normal and unaffected. Only diplomatic activities are slightly more active than usual.</p>
<p>Turkey - Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency) - Turkish political circles are not commenting on the changes in the Italian government for the time being, and are waiting for future developments. The opinion here is that the resistance in Sicily shows that Italy, under the leadership of the new government, does not want to surrender the country to the enemy unconditionally without resistance. Turkish newspapers pay more attention to Marshal Badoglio's declaration that he will continue to fight.</p>
<p>Spain - Madrid, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Spanish public was deeply moved by Mussolini's resignation, but the government has not yet commented.</p>
<p>Switzerland - Bern, 27th (Central News Agency) - Switzerland believes that the development of the situation in Italy does not cause concern. The Swiss Federal Council did not meet yesterday, and there were no special measures taken in various places. However, the members of the Federal Council maintained close contact with each other.</p>
<p>Britain - Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - Churchill will discuss the changes in the Italian government when the British House of Commons convenes. This news was released last night and is the first official response to the Italian coup.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - Authoritative sources in London declared last night that the British government is maintaining close contact with the United States and Soviet Russia to monitor the development of the new situation in Italy. Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky once last night, and then received US Ambassador Winant for a long secret talk.</p>
<p>Argentina - Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th (Central News Agency) - Argentine Foreign Minister Storni made his first official comment on the political changes in Rome last night, saying that the Argentine government's friendly attitude towards Italy has not changed, and it will continue to monitor the development of the Italian situation.</p>

<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) The war between the German and Italian coalition forces in Western Sicily has not been affected by the political development in Italy. The Axis forces are still holding their solid defense positions and have repeatedly resisted and defeated all insignificant attacks by the British and American forces.

<h3 id="e10">Fierce Battles on the Munda Front, Changes in the Dense Forest Land <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on the 27th, the Japanese and American forces have been fighting fiercely for days on the Munda front in New Georgia Island. The two sides have been shelling each other day and night. As a result, the dense forest area in that area has changed significantly. Seven enemy destroyers invaded the area on the 25th and continued to fire, and enemy planes also responded to this. From morning to dusk, they bombed repeatedly. The total number of enemy planes attacking reached 213, attempting to counterattack. The Japanese army is now fighting, still holding the battle line since July 21. They have either shot down enemy planes with ground artillery fire or defeated enemy forces attacking from the sea. The morale of the entire army is boosted, and they are determined to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to a report on the 27th from a certain place, Mr. Ono Sataye, a Japanese who recently returned from the southern front, said: The Japanese and American forces are now engaged in a fierce decisive battle in the Solomon Islands of New Guinea. The morale of the Japanese army is far superior to that of the enemy army. The gist of the report is: I went to the south in May this year and experienced hardships with our soldiers. The impression I got from this trip is that there is absolutely no need to worry about the defense of the front. The Japanese have established an invincible energy. Because in a certain place where they lived, enemy planes often came to bomb twice a day, taking advantage of the night or cloudy days. This proves how strong the Japanese air supremacy is. Japanese soldiers welcomed the arrival of enemy planes. Because of the relationship of controlling the enemy's power, the small bombs that were dropped only slightly damaged the ground. The Japanese army not only suffered no losses, but also got a full meal because the fragments hit the coconuts and fell down. Recently, the Japanese army in the area has been planting sweet potatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers, etc. The captain took the lead in leading them. This is enough to show that even in the midst of fierce fighting, the lives of the Japanese soldiers are still comfortable.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to the front line news, the enemy air force previously attacked Makassar on Celebes Island and Surabaya on Java Island. Until the 24th, squadrons of giant bombers attacked the northern part of Timor Island and Dili, the southernmost part of the Japanese-occupied area, as well as Maikor in the Aru Islands of Anti-Buddha, Samlaki in the Tiirlaut Islands, and Kikuhua on the southwest coast of New Guinea. However, they were all repelled by the Japanese troops on the island with fierce artillery fire. The Japanese army suffered no damage. In Maikor, a giant enemy plane was shot down.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing-American Air Base <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – A squadron of Japanese army planes launched a surprise attack on the enemy’s forward American air base on the 23rd, preemptively striking to thwart the enemy's attempted movements. This action by the Japanese planes seems to have caused great terror on the Chongqing side. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the "Chongqing Central Daily News" on the 26th published an article emphasizing the strength of the Japanese army's air force, and hoping that the United States would increase its air power. The gist of the article was: Although the war in the Munda area of the South Pacific is extremely fierce, the Japanese army's attacks on the Chongqing forces have not diminished at all. They are concentrating many aircraft against Chongqing. This challenge to the American air force with new aircraft should not be underestimated. The anti-Axis countries should quickly increase air power in that area.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to news received from this source, an advance American air force base stationed in Chongqing, as well as Zilin, Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, and other places, have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese air force in recent days, leading to extreme disarray. It is rumored that air raid alerts have been issued several times a day in recent days, creating an atmosphere of panic. Furthermore, the American air force stationed in Chongqing maintains strict secrecy regarding its actions due to the Japanese air raids. Every decision made is not communicated with local Chongqing authorities, which leads to Chongqing being unable to know details of the American planes' deployments and returns. Consequently, Chongqing authorities often mistakenly identify American planes as Japanese planes, issuing false air raid alerts. This lack of communication and cooperation between the American air force and Chongqing is now exposed.</p>

<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the Havas News Agency reports: Large-scale battles continued on the Eastern Front over the weekend. Soviet forces are continuously reinforcing their attacks on German positions. The enemy is increasing pressure south of Lake Ladoga. Whether this is a temporary phenomenon or the Soviet forces are establishing a second operational focus is difficult to predict at present. The enemy is also employing considerable forces in the Volkhov area and on the Shlisselburg front. German aircraft and reconnaissance teams are closely monitoring Soviet preparations for an offensive, and the German command has taken precautionary measures. German armored units counterattacked in the Mius River area, recapturing important mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The fierce fighting in Orel and other places has not ended. Military sources here believe that three weeks of fighting have weakened the Soviet offensive capability. The Soviet command has likely realized that repeated advances have yielded nothing and are tantamount to defeat. Soviet pressure on Orel has not decreased, but Soviet losses there have been heavy. The Soviet offensive between Belgorod and the Sea of Azov has diminished.</p>

<p>From 8:00 AM on the 15th, the four committees met separately to discuss the proposals of each group. The first committee, chaired by Hazama Shigeru, discussed issues related to the spirit of decisive battle. The second committee, chaired by Goichi --, discussed issues related to strengthening war capabilities. The third committee, chaired by Oda Nobutsune, discussed issues related to increasing food production and domestic self-sufficiency. The fourth committee, chaired by Tanaka Chie, discussed issues related to thoroughly implementing decisive battle living. The four committees convened for the entire day. Around 8:40 AM, Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy political affairs, took time to inspect each committee, listening attentively to the speeches of the council members. Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi, Minister of Interior Ando, and Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki also attended the various committees to listen to and respond to the speeches of the council members. At that time, Tokyo and the surrounding areas were conducting air defense drills, and the National Service Association's protection units were deployed inside and outside the venue in case of emergency. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely tense. The proceedings of the various committees on the second day are excerpted below:</p>
<p>First Committee: The main proposals in the first part included plans to mobilize scholars to conduct academic discussions and research with an emphasis on practical application, to launch a great spiritual movement to destroy the enemy, to revive the spirit of the Genko invasions, to restore ancestral traditions, and to popularize the spirit of Ninomiya Sontoku. Director-General Fujino of the Ministry of Education, Vice President Iinami of the Shrine Affairs Agency of the Ministry of Interior, and others explained the government's policies. In future policies, they will adopt as many of the recommendations in the above proposals as possible. Lieutenant Colonel Miyamoto of the Army Ministry then delivered a speech, expressing hope for cooperation in promoting decisive battle living. Ishiguro, Director of the Training Bureau of the National Service Association Headquarters, explained the Headquarters' policies regarding each proposal. Machida, Director of the Practice Bureau of the Industrial Patriotic Association, gave a concrete explanation of the industrial patriotic movement. The chairman then asked people other than the proposers to speak. Saburo Yotsukado spoke about the importance of cultivating officials in enhancing production. Rokuichi Koizumi emphasized that making clear the true state of the war to both superiors and subordinates is the fundamental issue in promoting decisive battle ideology. Takao Yamada argued that the phenomenon of joy and sorrow due to local victories and defeats on the wartime stage should be decisively rejected, and that the 100 million citizens should firmly maintain the determination for final victory. Miyazaki and Aoki proposed creating songs to destroy the British and Americans, sweeping the country to raise the spirit of decisive battle. In response, Director of the First Department of the Information Bureau, Muto, replied to the grievances about the government secretly concealing the true state of the war due to the nature of the war. At this point, the discussion of the first part of the proposals concluded.</p>
<p>The main proposals in the second part, regarding cooperation between the government and the people and matters of national guidance, included plans to establish independent youth schools and strengthen youth school education, to implement a compulsory system for girls' youth schools, to focus on vocational education to improve skills, to strive to cultivate excellent teachers, to establish full-time female instructors in various regions, for the state to manage the education of working youth and adolescents, to implement military education in girls' youth schools, to unify secondary schools and youth schools, and to strengthen national school education. Asa -- Ta-e (Vice-Chairman of the Japan Youth League) hoped that women would voluntarily serve the nation and hoped that society would improve its respect for working women. In response, Vice-Minister of Health and Welfare Takei replied: In the current state, the mobilization of male students should be further strengthened, and the same should be done for female workers. What should be noted here is the issue of conscription. Conscription is certainly the easiest method in terms of labor, but its impact on the spiritual aspect is extremely significant. Therefore, the authorities are doing everything possible to avoid conscription methods, so that the people will automatically reveal the spirit of labor and service to the country. Fujino, Director-General of the Ministry of Education, stated: The outline of the student mobilization plan has already been implemented, and regarding the mobilization of female students, he hopes that everyone's opinions will be fully considered and incorporated into future policies.</p>
<p>Second Committee: Regarding the issues of strengthening war capabilities and production, the government officials responded as follows: Director of the Enterprise Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Toyota, stated: When there are unqualified workers due to enterprise consolidation, they will be retrained or made to do light work manufacturing military supplies. Director of the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Nakamura, stated: Regarding the issue of conscription, a judging policy is currently being prepared. The opinions on this issue in this meeting will be fully considered and adopted. Following this, Sato, Chief of the War Preparations Section of the Army Ministry, explained the army's active cooperation in enterprise consolidation and the military's specific policies for the heavy industry sector. Hirai, Investigator of the Planning Board, stated: 1. As a result of this enterprise consolidation, the remaining workers in non-essential sectors will be able to make maximum use of minimal equipment to maintain national life and produce the minimum necessary supplies. 2. Regarding enterprise consolidation, the location of responsibility should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>In the afternoon's second committee, regarding the labor issue, Director of the Planning Board, Yamaguchi, replied: 1. I support the establishment of a national industrial reserve force. 2. I support the issue of conscripting students, but the types of schools should be differentiated. 3. The most appropriate form of wage payment is currently being closely studied with the relevant ministries. 4. The material distribution system for workers will be realized soon. 5. The problem of setting standard efficiency will be determined according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of national mobilization, Kujū Kodama (Principal of Meisei Middle School) hoped that the student mobilization outline would be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The mobilization of women has become increasingly important as the situation intensifies and is one of the most pressing issues at present. Sakuko Hani (Professor at Tokyo Free School) proposed an educational plan for women's mobilization. Hanako Muraoka (Director of the Tokyo Japan Women's Association) proposed paying attention to the physical and mental aspects of motherhood. Kiribuchi (Central Committee Member of the National Friendship Association) proposed mobilizing neighborhood housewives. Yamataka (Director of the Japan Women's Association) proposed regarding the conscription of women. Valuable opinions were put forward on the solution of this major problem.</p>
<p>Third Committee: The government's various emergency and permanent countermeasures for increasing food production during the decisive battle period can only be effective after the rural community is united and stable. This point concerns the strengthening of the rural leadership and guidance methods. The Third Committee had many valuable opinions regarding the food issue, arguing from the perspective of the leadership and mission of the landlord class, from the perspective of establishing rural education policies, from the perspective of comprehensive promotion strategies for rural guidance, from the perspective of combining rural spirit and agricultural technology, and from the perspective of the rural village system. Regarding the policy of increasing agricultural production, each council member stated the importance of adjusting the supply and demand policies from a specialized standpoint, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's timely and focused guidance is essential.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the meeting continued, discussing agricultural technology, fertilizer, labor shortages, and other issues that are the most direct obstacles to increasing food production. First, regarding technology, the number of part-time farming households has increased with the development of heavy industry, and their yields are extremely low. What methods should be used to ensure the rural structure? This is an urgent matter for agricultural technology guidance. Regarding the establishment of a very urgent labor mobilization problem in the busy farming season, the village and town heads are the chairmen, and the domestic food self-sufficiency increase production committee is set up to adjust the relationship between labor supply and demand. The chairman is given labor conscription -- and implements the planning and allocation. In addition, from the perspective of comprehensive food -- policies, raising prices for sweet potatoes, which are deeply related to increased production, and delegating distribution of exports to local officials, Ishiguro, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, replied to these issues:</p>
<p>1. The gradual increase in part-time farming households is an unavoidable state of affairs from today's reality. The government is working hard to implement policies such as establishing self-cultivating farmers.</p>
<p>2. Fertilizer was treated as one of the five major important industries in the previous meeting, and the government is working to ensure it. The composting movement is currently being implemented, and the two complement each other to break the current situation.</p>
<p>3. The importance of sweet potatoes is under consideration, and the establishment of storage facilities will proceed at the same time as the relaunch of this year's sweet potato and potato companies. Regarding transportation, close contact has been made with the Railway Ministry.</p>
<p>Finally, Kono, Director of the National Service Association Headquarters, said that the committee had been earnestly discussing the issue throughout with sincere and constructive opinions: The results of the committee, the association is also actively preparing for immediate implementation, not limited to rural areas, but also in the promotion of national movement, we should overcome all kinds of adverse conditions, in order to complete the food production increase, the meeting was held at half past five in the afternoon.

<p>In order to -- expand the Catholic cultural cause, in addition to the printing house, they also set up a "distribution center," divided into binding and sales departments, connected to the printing house factory. Equipped with electric ink absorption, paper handling, paper cutting, -- thread, binding, sizing, mounting, gold stamping and other -- type machines, undertaking all kinds of entrusted document binding, whether it is newspapers, magazines, classics, books, manuscripts, whether it is Chinese-style thread binding, Western-style cloth-covered spine, -- color can be chosen at --, the display counter of the distribution center is full of neatly decorated books, with the charm of making people attached. The sales department side, all the products of the hospital, such as statues, scriptures, Chinese and Western books, all kinds of records, have -- have -- have, and also sell books and magazines from Catholic churches in various provinces, etc., although they do not aim at profit, but the warm hospitality for the guests is already difficult to meet in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Equally important contribution to religious culture is the hospital's attached photography and plate making department, including photography, photocopying, customized copper zinc plates each part, although the mechanical equipment is not the latest style, but still called complete management, the products piled up like mountains on the wall rack, can be said to represent the past achievements of the department, however, due to the position, the main service object of photography and plate making seems to be several churches and church members, as well as printing companies related to religion.</p>
<p>Palace of Art</p>
<p>In addition to the printing press, the library, metalworking workshop, and woodworking workshop fully demonstrate the advancement of Catholic culture and art. As soon as you enter the museum, it is like entering an expo, full of all kinds of things and you can't see enough. The workers and apprentices in coarse cloth and torn clothes are working carefully in a quiet environment. The -- village of various paintings is mainly based on portraits—especially saints --, landscapes, still lifes, and religious history paintings, and also works to repair and enlarge photos, etc., lead paintings and oil are not few. Seeing their achievements, who would have expected that they were made by orphans of small age? If the scope of material selection is expanded to general historical paintings, and if they can jump out of the scope of tracing and enlarging, etc., with their usual religious cultivation spirit, and then draw drawing materials from the real society, then the future achievements must be unlimited. The paintings of the hospital have been repeatedly praised by the Nanyang Industrial Promotion Association, and in the midst of hard work, there must be better achievements in the future, -- which is especially --. One is the manufacture of hand-painted films, and the hospital technician is carefully dyeing the points of the film, almost stopping his breathing. The second is stained glass, in addition to being exquisite and beautiful, there are also bold and generous works, which are used for churches and luxurious buildings, and are the first production place for Chinese stained glass. It has always been sold at home and abroad. I am confused by the war and inconvenient to transport, there are many valuable orders still in the hospital, so that visitors can open their eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Huang Xuanping's Views: Steps to Stabilize Prices - Any Mild Strategy is Ineffective - Establishing a Standard Price for Essential Goods <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Xuanping, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Committee, recently made some remarks on the control of commodity prices. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the principles of commodity price control, I outlined the essentials in early 1942. Given the current situation, unless drastic action is taken, the commodity price control work in this city will be ineffective. Have we considered the social and economic repercussions if commodity prices continue to soar in the coming months or year? The salaries of tens of thousands of citizens are now being outstripped by higher living costs every month.</p>
<p>In my previous article, I pointed out that the prices of essential goods produced in Central China, which are sufficient for self-sufficiency, such as rice, flour, and cotton, can be stabilized. These essential goods should be distinguished from non-essential goods, which include luxury goods, imported goods, and irreplaceable items. Due to their scarcity, these items are sold at particularly high prices.</p>
<p>To stabilize commodity prices, a fixed commodity exchange ratio must be established. For example, six years ago, the transaction value of one dan of rice was equivalent to one bolt of cloth. The same exchange value ratio should be established now to stabilize prices and facilitate production.</p>
<p>It has now been proven that any mild strategy is ineffective in achieving the goal of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the following strict strategies are the only successful way to stabilize prices and are absolutely necessary to stabilize people's livelihoods. These strategies should be implemented simultaneously, on the one hand, to increase supply or production, and on the other hand, to reduce demand or consumption.</p>
<p>(A) Increase the supply or production of available essential goods:</p>
<p>(1) Purchase all essential goods from current owners at fair prices and allocate them to the public at cost prices.</p>
<p>(2) Determine a standard price for essential goods so that consumers can enjoy the benefits of fair prices. At the same time, producers will not have to worry about prices being too low, thereby encouraging them to continue production.</p>
<p>(3) Use funds and manpower only for businesses engaged in the manufacture of essential goods.</p>
<p>(B) Reduce demand or consumption:</p>
<p>(1) All loans should be limited to businesses that manufacture essential goods.</p>
<p>(2) Restrict food consumption.</p>
<p>(3) Implement full rationing, so that essential goods can only be purchased with tickets, with the tickets indicating the points representing various goods.</p>
<p>In fact, if banks, money shops, and trust companies could strictly limit loans for essential businesses and refuse to lend to speculative businesses, the price level would only reach a fraction of what it is today. The loan lists of banks, money shops, and trust companies should be immediately monitored. At the same time, all non-essential and non-industrial organizations and individual loans must be immediately recovered. The activities of silver companies should be inspected immediately. If these companies are not dedicated to production but are engaged in speculation, they should be ordered to close.</p>
<p>The rapid effect of implementing these measures often causes prices to fall. As a result, the fictitious value created not by seeking legitimate supply channels but solely by impressions and inflated demand is also eliminated.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is hoped that the food supply management authorities can understand the extreme importance of a continuous food supply and can supply on schedule according to the rationing plan, otherwise any stagnation or interruption will cause a serious reaction in prices.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Notice on How to Display the National Flag - Issued by the Shanghai New Life Movement Branch <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Branch, in view of the fact that the general public pays little attention to the method of hanging the national flag and has little understanding of respect and love for the national flag, has specially formulated a notice on the method of hanging and respecting the flag at the time of vigorously implementing the New Life Movement, so that the public organizations and merchants of this city can follow it consistently. It is also learned that the branch will send personnel to correct the situation on the spot from August 1st to 3rd. The original text of the notice is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Method of Hanging the National Flag</p>
<p>(1) Full Flag - The full flag means celebration. If there is a national celebration and the national flag is hung in various places on weekdays, it is called the full flag. There are two methods of hanging the flag: (1) If there is an upright flagpole, when raising the flag, first tie the upper and lower left corners of the national flag to the flagpole rope, or insert the flag rope into the flag tube and tie the two ends firmly, slowly raise it to the top of the pole, and slowly lower it when lowering the flag. (2) If there is no upright flagpole, first hang the national flag on the flagpole. If it is a single flag, it must be hung on the upper left of the door at an upward angle of 45 degrees, but the entire flag must be exposed outside the door. If it is a double flag, it should be hung crosswise in the center of the door.</p>
<p>(2) Half-Mast - In the event of a national humiliation memorial or the funeral of revolutionary martyrs and national heroes, the flag should be flown at half-mast to show mourning. There are two methods of hanging the flag: (1) If there is an upright flagpole, first raise the national flag to the top of the pole, then lower it to one-third of the entire pole (the short flagpole can be lowered to one-quarter). When lowering the flag, also first raise the national flag to the top of the pole, and then slowly lower it. (2) If there is no upright flagpole, first hang the national flag at one-third of the flagpole (one-quarter of the short flagpole), and then hang it on the upper left of the door, with the flagpole still at an upward angle of 45 degrees.</p>
<p>(B) Respect and Protection</p>
<p>(1) Be very solemn when saluting the national flag. (2) When raising and lowering the flag, stand at attention and salute, focusing on the national flag. When proceeding, if you encounter raising and lowering the flag, you must also stand at attention and salute. After the national flag is raised and lowered, you can continue to proceed. (3) In the event of damage or insult to the national flag, you should try your best to protect it and severely punish those who damage or insult the national flag. (4) When friendly countries raise and lower their flags, you should also salute to show friendship. (5) If the national flag is damaged, it cannot be patched, and it cannot be discarded or used for other purposes at will. It should be folded into cloth strips or burned with fire. (6) No matter where you are, if you see a discarded national flag, you should pick it up immediately. (7) The knots for tying the flag when raising the flag must be firm and not fall off midway. (8) The flag should be raised after sunrise in the morning and lowered after sunset in the afternoon. In case of windy, rainy, snowy, or foggy days, unless otherwise specified, the national flag should not be flown in the sky.</p>

<p>The final scene of the China General Motors Cup Charity Football Match, the decisive battle between the United Association and the Portuguese Jews, is scheduled to be held at Xuhui Middle School Stadium in Xujiahui at 6:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Small Ball Performance</p>
<p>Before the match, a small football performance interlude will be added. It is a match between Hua Ying and Zhong Hua. The former is a strong team composed of directors and stars from the China Film United Company, with Gao Zhanfei, Shu Shi, Mei Xi, Yue Feng, Huang Shaofen, Li Pingqian, and Liu Qiong also determined to participate. It will definitely be a wonderful performance when they meet with the Zhong Hua team for the first time.</p>
<p>Main Force Battle</p>
<p>The main match is between the United Association and the Portuguese Jews. The United Association is the representative team of all Chinese in Shanghai, and the Portuguese Jews are a collection of the best of the St. Francis, Portuguese, and Jewish teams, and almost all the outstanding talents in Shanghai have been collected. It is no less than a disguised form of the Western United team. The team wants to wipe out its previous humiliation and has specially challenged the United Association, determined to avenge its previous defeat. Yesterday, the three giants of St. Francis, Portuguese, and Jewish teams, Fu En, Victor, and Maya, were convened at the Jewish General Assembly for a small group meeting to review and pay for the response policy, which took up to four hours. In addition to the original personnel, the lineup has been strengthened with the addition of three Jewish generals, Maya, Favan, and Cohen. The United Association is also waiting in full force. Liu Xianhan's skills have recently reached their peak. Li Tiansheng is still able to maintain his peak form. Together with Zhang Lin's sweeping style, they can be called a perfect match. Song Ling's illness has recovered. Qu Yongfu's skills have improved rapidly, and he assists the front line with Zheng Yingquan. On the front line, Li Yichen has vowed to change his ways and work hard. Sun Jinshun is getting stronger as he gets older and is jointly charging into battle with the vigorous Gao Baozheng. Wu Qixiang and Fei Chunhua are used on the wings, which is a planned deployment. Observing the strength of the Chinese and Western teams, the Western team is slightly inferior. Commenting on the skills, the Western team is superior. The United Association wins with unity, and the Portuguese Jews' stamina and endurance will pose a major threat to the United Association. It is difficult to predict who will win when they meet. Tickets are sold for 30 yuan for general admission and 50 yuan for reserved seats. All tickets issued for the previous two matches are invalid today. For spectators taking transportation, buses on Route 22 of the French Concession and trams on Route 2 of the French Merchant can directly reach the stadium.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Celebrating the Thrift Movement <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai News Association launched a week-long thrift movement, hoping to awaken the attention of millions of citizens in Shanghai, automatically implement wartime thrift life, conserve material consumption, help stabilize commodity prices, and promote people's livelihood. This can be regarded as a grand event.</p>
<p>However, the thrift movement can be divided into two types: the first is the thrift movement in terms of materials, and the second is the thrift movement in terms of spirit. The former is thrift in a narrow sense, and the latter is thrift in a broad sense. Thrift in the narrow sense of materials is certainly important, but thrift in the broad sense of spirit is very important.</p>
<p>For example, Gu Tinglin, a gentleman of the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, lived a life of shame, seeking truth from facts, not doing superfluous things, not saying superficial words, going to bed early and getting up early every day. Anyone who invited him to dinner would return home before sunset, believing that "among the people in the world, except for those who elope and steal, how can there be righteous gentlemen who travel at night." This is Mr. Tinglin's further spiritual frugal life, so he lived to the age of sixty-nine (born in 1613 AD and died in 1681 AD).</p>
<p>Longevity is hoped for by everyone, and the most important prerequisite for longevity is to save energy at all times, especially the frugal spirit in youth to reduce material desires. If the residents of Shanghai can promote the meaning of frugal movements, and everyone can go out early and return early, get up early and go to bed early, clear their minds and calculate their sorrows like Mr. Tinglin, then the material consequences of thrift will inevitably achieve a more incredible and perfect degree.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Cotton Cloth Industry Association Plans to Establish Cotton Cloth Joint Venture <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that cotton cloth is one of the important materials and is closely related to people's livelihood, deems it necessary to organize a cotton cloth joint venture. It is learned that the joint venture is currently being drafted and prepared. It is found that the Cotton Industry Association has more than 2,000 members, all of whom will be members in the future joint venture.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Warehouses Not in the Association - Hope to Register as Soon as Possible <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee recently notified the Warehouse Industry Association that in order to implement the control of materials, warehouses and private storage places that have not joined the association should be reported as much as possible for verification. Therefore, warehouses in this city (whether exclusively operated or concurrently managed) that have not joined the association should register with the association before July 31st. According to their scale, they are divided into five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. The funds of the joint venture are also distributed according to the grade: 20,000 yuan for Grade A, 15,000 yuan for Grade B, 10,000 yuan for Grade C, 5,000 yuan for Grade D, and 2,500 yuan for Grade E.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Stock Market Trends <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose sharply, reaching new peaks. All stocks unanimously created unprecedented new highs. There were profit-taking sellers along the way, but with new and old investors actively participating, each stock quickly recovered after a slight dip, rising easily and sharply. Trading volume was quite robust.</p>
<p>The textile industry continued its upward momentum from the previous day. Wing On Textile, in particular, facilitated convenient transfer procedures and offered free exchanges of small-denomination new shares, making investment increasingly widespread, breaking through the major 300 level.

Chen Fong Dyeing &amp; Weaving, Dahua Weaving, and Hong Sheng Weaving all showed strong performance. New China, Kuo Hsin, and Five Harmony made significant progress. Yan Feng Dyeing &amp; Weaving, in a situation of low supply and high demand, broke through another level.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the gold shops in the city posted jewelry gold prices according to the limited price, and the handling fee was also the same as before, but there was no exchange. The off-market price rose again outside the barrier, and the silver price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The rise of unified government bonds was very sharp, among which the C type rose the most strongly, the D type was flat, and the other types also increased a lot.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate: The call loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained at two dimes and five cents.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The market was soft due to continued nervousness. The market was very weak at the beginning of the morning, but it recovered slightly due to a slight increase in appetite from the customers. However, the result was still low. Fine cloth fell, and it has entered the ninth level. The Four Gentlemen broadcloth was flat. Peach Lady Lin spot goods, and Three Sheep broadcloth were slightly higher.</p>
<p>Yarn: The market situation was still very quiet, and because the mobile certificate was temporarily suspended, there was almost no transaction. The market was sluggish, and only 20 counts of Double Horse yarn had a bidding price.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Miscellaneous grains were scarce, but the inventory was still available, so there was no shortage of goods. The sales market was minimal. Pudong wheat was within the sixth level, and Chongming soybeans were above the ninth level.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Matches continued to rise, such as the Phoenix brand has jumped out of two major levels, and other Rose Shanghai is also approaching the level. Soap and candles followed suit slightly higher. The trend of cigarettes is getting tighter, and the sales are getting stronger. The bidding price is unprecedentedly high, but there are no big deals.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Lustrous Woolen Cloth - Short Supply and High Demand <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Lustrous woolen cloth, those not woven from coarse wool yarn, various types of thick and thin woolen fabrics, have been exceptionally scarce in spot goods recently. The trend is unusually strong, and the selling price is expensive, to the point that it is difficult to purchase even with money. It is indeed evident that lustrous woolen cloth made of fine wool yarn is valuable due to the lack of spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Red Tea Cores – New Pharmaceutical Factories Engaged in Procurement – <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Red tea cores (also known as "flower fragrance"), due to continuous procurement by new pharmaceutical and chemical factories in recent days, have seen their inventory dwindle to depletion. Consequently, holders have become more reluctant to sell, while buyers, recognizing the difficulty in acquiring them quickly, have adopted a wait-and-see approach. As a result, trading has become quiet, and market prices have remained stable. The entire city has seen the pharmaceutical industry acquire only about 30 loads of the aforementioned type, with a reported transaction price of eight levels per load, sold by Wah On Tea Company. As for local stores, they are only making selective purchases as needed, acquiring eight loads of stir-fried green tea and over ten loads of common eyebrow tea, all sold by Mau Kee Tea Factory. The market situation is stable.</p>
<p>Activities of Various Trade Associations:</p>
<p>Seafood Wholesalers: The Shanghai Seafood and Sundries Trade Association has completed its preparations and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Fishermen's Association: The Shanghai Special City Fishermen's Association has also completed preparations and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Bakery and Pastry Industry: The Shanghai Bakery, Steamed Bread, and Fried Dough Trade Association has extended the deadline for member registration to the 30th of this month due to the fact that some members have not yet registered. No further extensions will be granted.</p>
<p>Translation: The Price Problem and the Controlling Authorities</p>
<p>Why are prices in Central China so high now? What is the root cause? Regarding this point, there are indeed many reasons, and the fact that the controlling authorities have not yet unified is also a major one. Consider just Shanghai, in addition to China's controlling agencies, there are also the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Japanese side, forming a total of four systems, and there is no sufficient communication between each system. Therefore, even if there are reasonable methods, the expected results cannot be obtained. The price situation has come to this, and the failure of the controlling authorities to unify is indeed a cause.</p>
<p>Now that the Public Concession and the French Concession are about to be recovered, this is indeed of great significance. In the future, the Shanghai local controlling authorities will only be China and Japan. Moreover, the abolition of extraterritoriality has become a fait accompli, so there is no doubt that China will be the sole controlling authority in substance. In addition to expressing our great joy about this situation, we also sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will recognize the importance of their responsibilities and take appropriate and sound measures.</p>
<p>In the future, for the Shanghai controlling administration, we hope that all measures will be based on the best performing past practices. In order to be reasonable and effective, we advocate that this more efficient administrative mechanism should be used as a model, and at the same time, the staff of each agency should receive equal treatment. And the treatment should at least be able to maintain a minimum standard of living. If this is not taken into account, and we talk about incorruptible politics, it will not be effective.</p>

<p>Blameless White Reeds By Ye Kewen</p>
<p>A few days ago, the temperature suddenly rose to over eighty degrees Fahrenheit, which seemed uncommon for such a warm season. As a result, people felt overwhelmed by the heat; our classroom, usually perched on the fifth floor, was deserted, but these past few days, it had become a popular spot for people to cool off. Especially the female students, they stood shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, chatting, whispering, and joking in groups of two or three at the corner of the corridor... A gentle breeze carried the fragrance of lotus flowers from the campus, occasionally mixed with their playful, chasing laughter.</p>
<p>Our "Blue-Clad Poet"—this was the respectful title we gave to a classmate who loved poetry and always wore blue—seemed to have caught a lucky streak of merriment these past two days. Every time we saw him walking up from downstairs, he was always smiling happily. When asked what he was smiling about, he would invariably shake his large head and shrug his thin shoulders with a smile, replying: "I'm not smiling at anything, I'm saying 'Man is an emotional animal', which is certainly true!"</p>
<p>According to A-Q the Second, the poet had recently taken a liking to a first-year female student, the one who skipped and bounced up to the fifth floor every day—high-nosed, bespectacled, and a very mischievous girl.</p>
<p>The poet had asked his classmates for her name several times, but no one knew. So he often lingered near the roll call list, repeatedly looking at the names of the first-year students, but always scratched his head, sighed, and retreated. After that, the poet had no choice but to stoop and chat with the school workers, starting from every trivial matter in the school, but always ending up with her. "Hey, Lao Er, who is that long-haired girl in the first grade wearing a crimson short coat these past two days? Is she new? Why didn't I see her last semester?"</p>
<p>"That's Wang Qian, she's new." Lao Er squinted his eyes slyly and smiled: "She's quite diligent, be careful not to corrupt her."</p>
<p>The poet had lost weight, and shyness had made him suffer fruitlessly for a week.</p>
<p>Misfortune finally befell our poet. It was a bright morning, the sun warmly caressing the earth, a cool morning breeze gently blowing on people, birds chirping sweetly on the branches; the campus sent forth bursts of floral fragrance. A person in green approached the school gate and handed over a letter. It was addressed to:</p>
<p>No. 6473 E Road</p>
<p>Miss Wang Qian, First Year, Qiren University</p>
<p>Details Inside</p>
<p>Under her perusal of this letter, she was soon consumed by shame and hatred. Thus, she resentfully handed over this "mushy" love letter to the class leader.</p>
<p>This was an ordinary love letter, but what was peculiar was that the signature inside the letter was "Blue-Clad Man", and the mailing address written on the letter was precisely our poet's residence.</p>
<p>The poet began to fall into a state of suffering, but he could not stop these absurd rumors and unreasonable attacks.</p>
<p>The next day, our poet, who never missed a class, suddenly did not come to school. Around ten o'clock, a school worker handed me a letter, which I knew without being told was from the poet. I quickly opened it and read:</p>
<p>Yi Jun: Please forward this letter to all classmates.</p>
<p>Dear classmates: Because of frivolous jokes, it has finally brought about a tragic consequence. I am not good at words, so when innocent slanders came upon me, I was at a loss with a flushed face. Moreover, this matter has inflicted a greater shock on me. I know that even the most skilled debater in the world would find it difficult to make this matter not involve me, let alone someone as uneloquent as I am!</p>
<p>I can guarantee my character—I would never do such a despicable thing! Perhaps it is the students' prank! But this prank seems to be too much.</p>
<p>The Destruction of A-Long By Dongfang</p>
<p>A-Long was a junior employee in the fashion department of a certain company. He had worked diligently as a trainee for five years before finally securing this job. He was a very amiable person and was well-trusted by the director. If he could continue to work hard, his future would be very promising. With a monthly salary of over five hundred yuan, he supported a family of three. Although it was not spacious, he could manage to get by. This time, when he received his salary, he wanted to buy a straw hat, but after calculating, he really could not afford the extra cost of several tens of yuan. However, couldn't he think of another way? He thought of gambling, hoping to win some money to buy a hat, and take his wife to a movie, and buy some food to nourish his empty stomach.</p>
<p>With a hopeful and optimistic heart, he entered the gambling arena. At first, he placed his bets cautiously. Seeing the money in his pocket gradually decrease, he felt disappointed and became anxious. Gradually, he became somewhat dazed, only knowing to throw rolls of banknotes onto the table, losing all his money.</p>
<p>"This is terrible, what should I do? Alas!" It was a sigh of regret and frustration. "Should I seek death? No, there's no need! I can only think of a way to get some money, and then go back to win back my losses, and try my luck."</p>
<p>He returned home, not even eating dinner, and sat on the bed in a daze, thinking about how to get the money. He couldn't borrow it. His colleagues and friends were all suffering from financial "anemia," and, like himself, were often strapped for cash. To ask them for money would be harder than leading a camel across a ravine. He could only pawn some clothes. As long as he could win back his losses, he could immediately redeem them, or maybe even win some extra! So, without consulting his wife, he took his own leather robe and his wife's camel hair cheongsam and pawned them for four hundred yuan. Stepping into the gambling arena, he immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>Once, twice, the lessons could not make A-Long give up. He believed that his luck wouldn't be this bad, and he wouldn't keep losing. He gradually became addicted to the gambling arena. He didn't listen to his wife's bitter advice, or the persuasion of relatives and friends. He disregarded the livelihood of his family, and he pawned all his and his wife's clothes and all the slightly valuable items at home. Sometimes, he did win some, but he didn't redeem his clothes and belongings, but instead kept the money for his next bet. At times, he would redeem them, only to send them back to the pawnshop a few days later. He also lost focus at work, often arriving late and leaving early. Relatives avoided him because he often borrowed money from them. Gradually, the director of the fashion department became suspicious of him.</p>
<p>One day, A-Long lost all his money, and there was nothing left at home that he could pawn. This time, he had no money for the rent, rice, and coal, and he also had to repay the debts he owed to relatives. The clothes and belongings that he had pawned were also a considerable sum. He felt that his future was bleak and uncertain. He felt that life was boring. He thought of committing suicide, but he felt sorry for his family, for his wife and child. He racked his brains but couldn't come up with a solution. Suddenly, an idea struck him: "Let me borrow some clothes from the company for a while! As long as I win a little, I can quickly redeem them and return them. It will only be for a little while, and no one will know," But he didn't think about what would happen if he lost them.</p>
<p>The next day, he secretly took two pieces of clothing that customers had ordered but not yet picked up. Just as he was wrapping them in paper, preparing to take them away, the director discovered his theft.</p>
<p>His job was gone! He was lucky to have avoided a lawsuit!</p>
<p>Leaving the company, A-Long was like a wounded beast, dragging his heavy feet. All the past flooded into his mind: his wife's bitter advice, the persuasion of relatives and friends, the harmonious family and stable life before he gambled... Regret, hatred, sorrow, and anger gathered in A-Long's heart. He felt a strong pang of conscience. He had no face to go home to see his wife's sad face, to hear his child's innocent calls. He felt that everything was over. Gambling had broken his job and ruined his reputation!</p>
<p>The next morning, A-Long's body was found in the Huangpu River. Gambling had ended A-Long's young life.</p>
<p>In the Dark Night By Rong Xichun</p>
<p>I grope forward alone,</p>
<p>The night wind sweeps through the leaves,</p>
<p>Making a shrill sound.</p>
<p>It is just like the mourning of an owl,</p>
<p>There is no moon in the sky,</p>
<p>Nor are there any stars,</p>
<p>Boundless darkness</p>
<p>Envelops the long journey,</p>
<p>In the darkness,</p>
<p>I still grope forward,</p>
<p>The surroundings are so dim,</p>
<p>And so eerie,</p>
<p>Although I know,</p>
<p>The biting night wind,</p>
<p>Will congeal my hot blood;</p>
<p>The terrifying darkness,</p>
<p>Will frustrate my ambition,</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>Like a crazy man with numb nerves,</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of the biting cold,</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of the terror,</p>
<p>Yet forever groping in this way,</p>
<p>Incessantly,</p>
<p>Wanting to seek</p>
<p>In this dark and long night,</p>
<p>A glimmer of light at dawn!</p>
<p>Dream By Zhang Xinjuan</p>
<p>Last night, I had a dream, a beautiful dream.</p>
<p>I dreamt that wings grew on my shoulders, and I flapped them, soaring in the azure sky. Flying, I flew to a majestic palace, gently knocking on the door of happiness. Later, I met a beautiful angel, her body draped in thin silk, like cicada wings, emitting the light of the evening glow.</p>
<p>Everything was beautiful, fantastical, I was joyful, delighted; intoxicated in that solemn yet sweet atmosphere.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the haze, a green-faced, fanged giant was extending its demonic claws to snatch me away. Ah, how terrifying!...I mounted a snow-white steed, holding a gleaming sword. On both sides of the sword were engraved the words "Reason" and "Emotion". I wielded it, aiming it at the demonic claws. The sword light was as dazzling as lightning, startling and terrifying....</p>
<p>I heard celestial music playing in the clouds....</p>
<p>This was a dream, a beautiful and fantastical dream.</p>
<p>Thoughts on Loving Birds By Kami Roji Tadao</p>
<p>By making a small hole in a small box and hanging it on a suitable tree, you can make a nest inside. This is called a nest box.</p>
<p>Not only in Central China, but also in China, the number of trees is so small that it can be seen in the garden. The reason for studying the reproduction of birds is that the first thing to consider is the forest. In places where trees are scarce, the provision of nest box facilities will greatly help the reproduction of birds. Most Chinese people love birds, but the birds they love are often locked in cages, or tied their feet. I want people who love birds to understand the true meaning of loving birds.</p>
<p>The most important thing in loving birds is the birdcage. Our birdcage is as high as the sky and as wide as the earth. The birds in the world are the birds we love. People who love nature must be loved by nature. When people show kindness to birds, birds will also repay people with kindness. This point should be seen deeply by human beings.</p>
<p>Many birds breed in forests and grasslands, but due to the transition of spring, summer, autumn and winter, and the reasons for cutting grass and trees, birds breeding in grasslands will have no way to survive. People enjoy the autumn harvest, and when cutting weeds, they should consider that birds are also born by nature. It is the same as treating the birds flying in the air as the birds raised in your own cage. It is a great blessing for both people and birds, and the idea of making nest boxes will arise spontaneously. If the nest box movement spreads throughout Central China, the harvest of rural benefits can be imagined. We only need to use an empty box as a nest box and hang it on a nearby tree. From the bird born in its nest to its death, it will never forget the kindness of people.</p>
<p>Those who love people's virtue are birds, those who repay people's kindness are birds. For the benefit of the people, the implementation of the nest box plan should not be ignored. Ah!</p>
