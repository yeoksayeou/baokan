<h3 id="c1">申論物資動員 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>物資動員為總力參戰的重要部分，其意義之重大及動員之原則，一昨已加評述。但要求達成動員之最大效率，則尙須講究根本之道。因為國家及人民所存物資，究屬有限；而戰時軍需民用的消耗，都將與日俱增，結果勢必供不應求。或有人以爲我國不均，流通不調，而消費不加相當節制，則銅山之罄，指顧間事。况事實上，事變以來六年之間，我國物資本有捉襟見肘之狀。茲請略述積極與消極的對策如下：</p>
<p>積極方面可分兩點：第一，須謀物資的增加，而首賴生產之促進，除政府機關自謀生產外，尤須獎勵民間生產，無論農，工，鑛業，凡民間所能生產的，都應盡力獎勵與扶助之，在政治上，金融上，運輸上，消售上給以方便。更具體的說。（一）對於已經設立的工廠，作塲，農塲，務須督促其充分利用生產能力；如有廠家囤積原料，不事生產，或若干地主覇佔良田美地，任其荒蕪等現象，必須迅速加以合理的觀導，使其恢復生產。（二）擴大工業合理化運動，即各工業部門間地區，作業項目，原料取給，產業管理，產品分配等之合理化，及互相合作等。（三）提倡農村手工業，利用農村閒散勞動力，以增加物資生產。（四）政府爲了獎勵人民生產，必要時應供給低利資金，代爲設備，給予原料保障，運輸便利，並介紹優良技師，派員巡迴指導。不過人民資本有限，或不願冒險，所以對於若干產業部門，必須由政府經營，但鑒於過去國營事業失敗的情形，在原則上仍以「官督民營」爲主。第二，原有物資及增產物資之流通，自亦爲重要問題：在和平區內，務求其盈虛相濟，所以不必要的檢查，應當免除，徒增生產障礙的捐稅亦應减少。</p>
<p>消極方面：第一是物資的分配問題，應視各地需要之多寡，物資重要性的差別，以定起運的緩急，與運費之大小，在整個計劃下利用交通工具，以謀物資分配之合理化。其次，我國經濟組織散漫，尤以中間商人爲甚，除少數大城市外，物資存量與售量，批發價格與零售價格，無從統計，因此平價工作，不易着手，爲適應此種情形，對於若干日用必需品，似乎由政府公賣，或由政府特許商人專賣，則物資產量，存量及消費量，都可瞭如指掌。不過，如行專賣，須有民間的監督機關，以免營私舞弊。此外，最値得提倡的是合作社運動，藉以消減中間人的利潤，避免物價漲風，目可除去中間商人的囤積操縱；於消費者固有利益，對於物資管制機關也有幫助。第二是物資消費問題，對於存量或產量極少的軍用物品，應禁止一般人使用，而產量不充足且有缺乏之可能性者，應當限制人民使用之救量與用途。例如糧食不可釀酒。對於不正當或非必需的物品，如土地栽種鴉片，倉庫儲糧之腐爛等，都應明定罰則。至於公私物資的節約運動，尤應努力推進。</p>
<p>最後，一切有關物資流通的立法施政，務須先有普遍嚴密的調查統計，經過充分的研究，始能求其結果之萬全。而戰時法令簡便化，尤爲不可漠視的原則。其次關於物資動員的機構，必須統一職權，力避掣肘；而對於政令施行之效果，尤應時加考核，明定賞罰。物資動員是「總力參戰」的主要項目，深願政府當局與有關各界加以注意。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日本本屆議會的成就 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>日本本屆議會，通過了日本財政史上新記錄的歲出總額四百七十四億（包括臨時軍　費二百七十億、的預算案，之外，並又成立了戰時特例法案等重要法案八十九件。這許多法案，都是爲了適應目前的决戰階段而改革替換必要的國內體制，不僅在戰時爲劃時期的施策，即在平時，亦爲應毅然一一加以實施的重要案件。</p>
<p>本屆議會最切時宜的收獲，厥爲闡明了必勝政治的大道。在議會開始之初，東條首相的施政方策演說，關於增强戰力的政府方面的指導精神，希望一億民衆集中所有的力量，並將加以全面的活用，這宣言完全掃除了關於國內體制上種種複雜的意向與懸念，團結於統一的組織之下。同時，政府所闡明的緬甸，菲島的獨立方針，以及對華政策之劃時期的轉變，這都是日本政府的基本國策，經本屆議會而宣佈於世界。</p>
<p>鑒於議會的成就，我們痛切地感覺到當局與民衆應相互黽勉，自肅自奮，議會的成就，確立了對內對外的道義政治與道義外交。在戰爭遂行上，道義政治與道義外交，往往易被人誤解爲一種退却乃至弱體化。可是，首相當實施戰時行政時，不發動强權，而完全信賴國民的自覺與忠誠心。因爲首相確信國民的自覺與忠誠心，勝過用權力去推動，而爲增强戰力的根基。議會的成就之眞正的發揮，繫於當局的指導與民衆的實踐。至於共榮圈的外交，擴充道義精神與公平明朗，尙祇做到一半，其餘一半，有待於英美及蔣政權的澈底擊滅。又此次通過的法案應特別重視的，如戰時行政特別法案，都制案，市町村制修正案，戰時刑事特別法修正案等，其眞正的價値，不在於北成立就算了事，而在於今後的運用如何？總之，此次議會，雖然完成了議會的使命，但爲使其成就成爲決戰體制的基礎，則今後當局應率先示範，領導於前，而民衆追隨實踐於後，向前邁進。（翔：譯自三月十二日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<p>日本第八十一議會再開以來，大約已有四旬了，在內外環視之中，進行着各項議事：衆議院於八日完畢了全部議案，貴族院亦於十日把餘下的法案全部議畢，十一日起休會。此次議會適逢決戰之年，故其意義的重大，在歷屆議會夏並不多見，而其所舉成果，亦爲前此議會　少有。僅就成立的預算及法案來看，明年度的各項預算，在歲出總計四百七十四憶元中，包括二百七十億元的臨時軍事費，實爲日本財政史上空前的決戰歲計。又戰時特例法案以下達八十九件的法律，均爲更改國內體制聲中，有關增强戰力之劃期的施策。故際此世界戰亂方酣之時，由於此等議案的成立，以日本精神爲基調的決戰政治之方向，得以明瞭，這是此次議會所得的最大的收獲。</p>
<p>首相之明快的闡明</p>
<p>滿洲事變以來，歷屆內閣，咸有試把日本的政治，依着遂行戰爭的方向，爲重建之努力。如統帥和國務的一致，首相行政權限的强化，中央和地方行政機構的一元化，以及改組議會勢力爲翼贊型，强化經濟統制，籌謀國內團結等，凡此嘗試，雖亦爲動亂期中世界的風潮所趨，然無疑爲最近日本內閣所致力者。同時，亦爲此次議會中所提出的諸法案之目標。這種轉向戰爭政治的動向，果眞立於怎樣的基調之上呢？沒有傾向獨裁政治之虞嗎？沒有使行政機構和相應的企業形態發生急激的變革嗎？諸如此類的疑問和關心，由議員方面提出。對之，東條首相均以明快的態度，闡明了政府的所信。東條首相在這次議會再開當初，於其施政方針的演說中，表明政府所抱着的決戰政治之基本態度云：「關於增强戰力，政府的指導精神，爲期待一億同胞的旺盛之力，俾作全幅的活用者。」並在貴衆兩院的預算總會及戰時行政特例法案委員會中，力說如下各點云：</p>
<p>（一）政府逐行戰時行政的態度，並非發動强權，而是徹底信賴國民的自覺和忠誠。</p>
<p>（二）首相的權限强化，並非獨裁，他國的獨裁主義，依照日本國體，沒有考慮餘地。</p>
<p>（三）內閣制度及行政機構的急激改革，有碍於增强戰力，並不採用。</p>
<p>（四）在强化經濟統制之際，如重要實業之國家管理，經濟形態之改革等，並不施行，當盡量活用國民之創意計畫。</p>
<p>（五）在官界發揚信賞必罰之精神。</p>
<p>在此次戰連續之苛烈的戰局下，一意推進適合於國體之日本的政治，由此堅定舉國一致的團結，以應付這個次戰期，此種必勝政治的大道，可謂已昭示於道裏了。</p>
<p>然而此種決戰政治之日本的性格，絕不是削弱政府之完遂戰爭態勢者，絕不是容許一部分政治勢力之任意的行動者，又絕不是使經濟統制之進行一時後退者，由下所述四項，可以明白。即（一）東條首相曾在衆議院力說政戰兩策態勢的完整，並表明兼攝陸相之決意，（二）鼓起戰時行政特例法的論議，而揭示進向首相權限的强化和對於超重點實業之行政一元化的輪廓，（三）在貴族院聲明對於擾亂國內團結之惡性的流言蜚語，決不假借而取締之。（四）岸商相更作如次之斷言云：「今後爲增强生產起見，强化統制，使生產益趨計畫化，是絕對必要的。」</p>
<p>決戰外交的眞諦</p>
<p>際此日本的內政外交正以大東亞爲軸心而被一元化地展開着的現在，日本的戰爭政治之推進，不獨限於國內政治面，即在佔領地行政上，在共榮圈外交上，亦正進展看以肇國的精神爲基調之劃期的政策，這政策已通過議會而被具體地闡明了。東條首相在其施政方針的演說中，所作關於緬甸及菲島的獨立之重大聲明，已予佔領下的諸地域及諸民族，以極大的影響。又對於共榮圈內諸國家，日本政府之基於道義的各項聲明，亦爲現正進行着的諸政策所保證，足以使其諒解日本之決意與眞意者。</p>
<p>尤其是關於對華政策，以國府參戰爲機緣，日本的政策有着劃期的轉換，如治外法權的徹廢，租界的交還，以及進行着的政治，經濟及其他方面之强力的支援，凡此等等，政府在議會中的聲明，已大受注目。至於靑木大東亞相之關於幣制，劃兌政策等日本之援助方策，及佐藤陸軍省軍務局長關於政策轉換後日本的措置及其在重慶並其他敵國方面所起深刻的影響，均有詳細的說明。總之，徹底尊重中國的自主獨立，支援國民政府强化其政治力，俾日華成爲一體，向着完遂大東亞戰爭之途邁進，日本之此種公明的態度，於事實上已被證明，並被闡明於中外了。</p>
<p>其反面，「共榮圈內唯一的叛逆者軍慶政權，惟有斷然討滅的一途，」這是靑木大東亞相及佐藤軍務局長在議會中的答辯，亦非銘記不可。又首相的聲明云：「對於欲與我協力之共榮圈內諸國，常以親子之情誠心誠意支援之，然對於不解我眞意而甘爲英美之　使者，當出以斷乎的措置，」這可說是吐露決戰外交的眞諦者，當可期待其一貫內外，根據日本的基調，而使大東亞的政治，有雄偉的進展。</p>
<p>政治推之組織法</p>
<p>經這次議會通過成立之重要法律，其大部分可說是要强力地推進此種政治之組織法，故坐於位居官職者，應恪遵立法的本旨，尊重議會中政府的聲明，以期反省惕厲，運用適當。惟有如斯，國民的忠誠，乃愈益燃起，決戰突破的新政治，更得堅强地確立吧。</p>
<p>這次議會是大東亞戰爭下第二次的通常議會。前次第七十九屆通常議會，係於緒戰煊赫的勝利之中舉行，國民的注意都集中於戰局的推栘上，而政府提出的議案，亦限於當前之緊急施策，議論的餘地很少；然而這次是在征戰第二年的決戰期裏，大東亞的敵人據點，悉已爲日本所有，可以建設長期必勝之國內態勢的階段上而舉行的，政府提案的件數遠多於前，而且其內容亦以增强後方國民之戰力爲中心，涉及之點頗多。首當此等諸法律運用之衝的官府，其期待如何，由民意暢達的立塲來說，自然要議論沸騰，這可說是當初所預料的。</p>
<p>環繞翼政的活動</p>
<p>又這個議會是在去春總選舉及所謂「國內政治力的結集」以來，方才舉行的通常議會，這是不可忘記的。唯一的政事結社之翼政會，成立之日尙淺，僅就共是舉國的大同團結來說，統制未臻周密，結合力也不强。其協力於政府而欲遂行戰爭之基本的方向，雖然沒有異論，可是關於各個問題，其各式各樣的活動，已自議會之前表面化了。而且有政府，翼政，翼贊三位一體之稱的政治機構，其相互之間有着怎樣的關聯？將要怎樣活動下去？於翼政今後之政治活動，是重大的問題，因此惟有通過這個議會，可使其歸趨明瞭，此種期待，也可說是當然的。</p>
<p>在議會面前揭起的翼政內部之各式各樣活動，是和這次議會所具上述的特色相照應的。即（一）把決戰下緊急課題之增强戰力問題，作全面的處理，由此對沈滯的翼政會賦與確固的政治活動之方向，以使鞭撻政府，這是淸新俱樂部，三十日會，經濟議員聯盟等之活動。（二）改革翼政內部之機構，使明確其責任的所在，並使確立翼政翼贊一體的國內政治機構，這是少壯中堅各派的希望。（三）應檢討政府所提出的各法案是否爲對於增强戰力有直接關係之緊急法案，這是一部議員的强硬論。此等均被視爲意見激昂的。</p>
<p>第八十一屆議會是在這樣的情勢之中再開的，因此對於問題的法案，修正論便抬起頭來，舉凡戰時刑事特別法中改正法，都制法市制中改芷法，村鎭中改正法，日本証券交易所法，農業團體法，水產業團體法等，均被搬到其俎上了。這與其說是追及政府的聲明，不如說是由於未見翼政內部的意見一致而爲重複的政治折衝的現象：與其說是對政府的問題，不如說是處理翼政內部的問題。故政府與議會的協力態勢，並未受到何等根本的影響，而翼政內部，則今後留下了問題，可視爲是促進確立强力的內部機構之要望者。</p>
<p>政府之率直的態度</p>
<p>對於上述的議會　勢，政府自初即以公明率直的態度，來作政策的說明，反之，對於退縮的議論，則始終出以毅然的態度。在議案之事前審查中，政府亦把成爲議論之的的法案，依照旣定方針，毫無躊躇地提出，並且東條首相支着病軀登院，在議會再開之時，就以開頭即是「今年正是決戰之秋」之劃期的施政方針演說，把征戰必勝的決意宣吿於中外。首相又在二月一日貴挨院的本會議上，表明關於國內團結的確信，復於二日預算總會上，表明兼攝睦相的決意，羣議爲之一掃。關於重要政治問題，首相亦在委員會中，以溢露自信的態度，一再臨陣發言。</p>
<p>證實政府的優越</p>
<p>議會的情勢雖然多端之極，然而如上所述，其眞摯的議論和對於政府之積極的協力態度，一脫議會似與政府對立之舊套，而踏上了重建日本的議會之第一步。又其反面，執行戰爭政治的政府，其優越的地位，亦在議塲上漸被證實。而且在這次議會通過成立的諸法律中，其戰時行政特例法，是强化首相權限及使生產行政一元化者；地方制度的改進法，是使行政權限之中央集權化及增進執行機關對於議決機關之優越性者。又關於經濟之諸法律，亦爲以統制的强化與行政的敏速爲目標者。由此觀之，內閣指導力的强化，由此等諸法律的施行，終於可以實現。故在決戰政治中，政府與議會的關係，由這次議會，將使相互的地位趨於明確，當非過言。</p>
<p>在這次議會中，翼贊會問題的議論，始終不出於選舉等過去的批判，未免稍有低調之憾。然而這到底爲一部議員的論難而停止。而且把翼贊會及各種有關國民運動等之國民組織，加以全面的否定之論難，已吿絕跡，這可說是議會對於國民組織之進步。（丁：譯自三月十日十一日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c35">重光大使的一番話　期待中國復興 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>重光大使昨日招待中國新聞記者團，發表談話，主要的有兩點，他說：「目睹上海一般情况，均見改善，尤以經濟方面爲最，此爲上海經濟界領袖積極協力，方有此成效。」又說：「對中國之期待無他，即中國國民爲復興中國而努力」。我們認爲重光大使的話，不是恭維獎飾，而是誠摯的熱望，我們在中國人民　立塲，不禁感覺對國家責任的重大，而須加倍警惕</p>
<p>第一，這次上海經濟方面的新設施，僅爲嘗試中的初步改革，它的主要原因，誠如大使所云：「得經濟界領袖積極協力，方有此成效。」但另一方面，也爲了這種設施，是適合當時當地的環境，纔有此改革。所以，一切的經濟設施——也可以說一切政洽社會種種設施，如要得到成效，就必須有（一）人民與政府的充分合作（二）適合當時當地的環境的兩個前提，否則必然徒勞無功，這一種實騐的寳貴的結論，大可作爲今後中日關係與政府和人民努力的指針。這次上海經濟方面的設施，不過初步的改革，完善的成效，還須待於中日雙方政府與人民的繼續努力。</p>
<p>第二，重光大使期待中國國民爲復興中國而努力，我們實有同感。中國的復興，固然在於國民自己的努力；可是，在目前的情况之下，老實說，一半還要靠友邦的處處誠意輔助，充分給中國人民以自由發展。中國的復興，也就是東亞復興的定力，我們接受了重光大使誠摯熱望的一番話，深深地引起了無限的自勉。</p>

<p>「開源節流」是目古以來中國理財學上的惟一方案。若以這一句括當作戰時經濟的原則，尤爲切合，因爲戰時經濟的一方面，是重在增加生產，而戰時經濟的另一方面，是車在節約消費；設令生產儘管增加，消費不能節約，結果將使生產力量的推進爲徒勞，爲無補戰時的經濟建設。</p>
<p>社會問題，尤其是戰時社會問題的解決，決不能單靠一些原則，一些法令，最主要的是要靠社會人士來辦，而由政府站在指導和監督的地位。這次全國商業統制總會的成立，使是社會各界共同協助解決社會問題的一個最好先例。無疑地，這一個機構的主要任務是調整物資供求關係，自須以促進生產爲其先決問題。可是，我們最不能忽視的是，促進生產而外，必須提倡節約，環顧戰時的世界各國，那一個國家不是力求消費的節約？舉一兩個例來說罷，在日本，出人于酒樓菜館者，不能免于重稅，在法國，最堪號召的舞塲與夜總會，不惜予以取消；道都是節約消費方面必要的措置，堪資模效的。</p>
<p>無論如何，在推行戰時經濟的程序中，節約消費與增加生產，必須兼籌並顧，相輔而行：屏絕奢華，固須認爲戰時必要的條件，節衣節食，亦當視爲戰時應盡的義務。我們認爲節約消費與整個戰時經濟問題，有最密切的關係，希望政府予以積極的倡導，人民予以普遍的合作；為求澈底解決這一個問題，似宜由政府組織一個民衆節約消費指導委員會，並由民間選出適當的人物來協助政府宣傳，指導，推行這樣一個重要的運動；在必要的塲合下，即由政府强制執行，亦當視爲合理行動。</p>

<h3 id="c51">中儲劵的強化 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>所謂强化國民政府這件事，就經濟部份來說，不外乎復興國府治下的經濟。但是復興經濟的先決條件，就是要週貨制度的健全發展。由於這　意味，國府參戰後的經濟政策，第一個主要目標就是通貨制度的整頓，具體的論，必須側重於加强中儲券。</p>
<p>中儲券的强化，不得小從種種方面來檢討，第一是和各種通貨有關的問題。雖然說敵性舊法幣及　他雜券已被逐出華中，但是目下依然在鄰近和平區的四周流通。聯銀券與中儲券的密切關係，不用說是非常密切的，可是兩者的關係，就共榮圈的整個見地來觀，還有須待改良的地方。看了中儲券和軍票的關係。可知中儲券和日元的關係是多麼密切。但是我們還有進一步的希求，盼望這種關係要適應現狀，有健全的發展，做到共榮圈通貨關係的模範。</p>
<p>但是建立中儲券和其他通貨的關係，就中儲券方面來講，還是着車於中儲券本身的內容。換句話說，中儲券要對其他通貨樹立安當的關係，必先自身在和平區內做出眞正健全的通貨成績。第一，中儲券的發行工作，應該常常使人們明瞭。據我們所知道的，中儲券無論發行額方面或者發行準備額方面，都很健全。近來物價的變動，它的原因是局部的，假使有人對中儲券的信賴發生動搖，那末應該把它的事實原因何在使社會人十明瞭，才能緩和一般人的動搖心理。第二，關於旣發行的中儲券的行蹤去跡！應該懇切說明。如果使　般人曉得中儲券的行蹤去跡！決不是在投機，囤樍方面，都是用諸於强化國府與復興經濟方面，那麼？它的效果必大。</p>
<p>通貨制度的整頓，不僅是通貨本身的問題，最要條件，還是要以通貨爲媒介，利用商品流通與金融交易的健全來整頓通貨制度。設立全國商業枕制總會，就是商品流通工作具體化的表現。要記着這個統制總會的健全發展，就是中儲券的側面進展。但是在金融方面怎麼樣呢，敢說這是華中經濟情勢的取不健全的部份，道是無可否認的。公共和界工部局，一向努力要改革這種弊病，我們深表敬意，但我們更望國府强化過去的彈壓投機方針，尤盼中國的財界人士，格外自重。</p>
<p>唯有各就本位直接間接來協力加强中儲券，方爲處身和平陣營裏面人們的責任，這是我們一貫的主張。（雲鵬：譯自三月十九日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c52">夢想與實現 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 寒風</p>
<p>我們人類具有一種紋神妙的力量，就是有夢想的能力，每一個人生活在世上，都有他志願的夢想，即使不能够完全實現，但也有相當的價値。在夢想裏有着偉大的力量；能够增强我們的智能，使我們的才幹與潛在的才力盡量地發揮出來。有了夢想才有遠大的希望，才有光明的前程。如果失却了夢想力，那麼一切的希望，勇毅與繼續努力的志氣，亦完全付之泡影。</p>
<p>歷史吿訴我們；世界偉大人物的童年時代之腦；中，都是充滿着各種奇特的夢想；說得明白些，就是他們都做過夢想者，但並不是空洞的夢想，而是基於確切的事實的。他們所以能够獲得成就，就是他們能　夢想使之實現，無論遭到的環境是多麼的黑暗，他們都能以堅決不移的信心與切實的努力，終究克制了一切的阻碍，而獲取偉大的成功。所以我們應該發揮堅毅的努力來實現偉大的夢想。</p>
<p>向上的思想，足以改進我們的夢想。夢想而不使之實現，就成爲妄想。我們要構成夢想；除要具有决心的努力之外，還要有堅定的信仰；信仰你所夢想的事物能够實現。更要激勵你的夢想，切不可抱着懷疑的態度，懷疑會减弱你的勇毅和努力的志氣。所以我們應該祛除懷疑的心理，容納成就的思想。能够實現的夢想，才有價値，才是偉大的。一個有夢想而又有信仰的人，他的前途才是遠大的，光明的！</p>
<p>夢想者，可說是人類的先鋒，畢生勞碌，不辭艱辛地替人類開闢出平坦的道路來。</p>
<p>如果一個人的夢想，是基於事實的。那末，美滿的成功正在等待着你呢！</p>
<h3 id="c53">二月份徵文錄取第二名　怎樣讀書，讀什麼書？（上） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 應源澤</p>
<p>一　怎樣讀書？</p>
<p>小言</p>
<p>闢頭一句話；讀書是苦事，也是樂事。爲什麼是「苦事」呢？因爲不懂讀的方法，往往事倍功半，勞而無功，令人感覺痛苦。爲什麼又是『樂事』呢？因爲懂得讀的方法，每能成竹在胸，依計進行，在短時期內收穫最大的效果。所謂『苦』也，『樂』也，其分岐點全在乎讀書法的運用是否適當，因此「怎樣讀書」這問題，値得每一位修學之士去深深思想的。</p>
<p>關於『怎樣讀書」這問題，千頭萬緒，範圍廣泛，在專家們的手裏，簡直能把它寫成一本洋洋巨著。筆者不學，經騐父感缺乏，無已，姑就平日瀏覽所及，輯爲下列數項，以就正於國內明達之士。</p>
<p>兩種讀法</p>
<p>讀書的方法很多，但比較上最切合實用，而範圍亦最廣大的，計有兩種；一是求精的方法，一是求博的方法。這兩種方法，在人生求學的過程中兩皆需要，不可偏廢。單求精而不講博，其弊必致陷於孤陋寡聞，識見有限，不免於「書獃子」之譏。反過來說；單求博而不講精，結果必致貪得無饜，不求甚解，讀了等於未讀。</p>
<p>所以，折衷的辦法是『精』，「博」並重，不可偏廢。原來有好些專鬥性質的書，其文筆旣極雅馴，內容亦相當精湛，讀者於　，應聚精會神的把它細讀精讀，從宇裏行間體會出原書的精義，以尊定個人高深知識之基礎。至於一般有關常識的書，其種類繁多，不勝枚舉，讀者如欲細讀精讀，雖窮畢生之精力，亦不可能，唯一的方法是將各書涉覽一過，觀其大概而已。換言之，即因時制宜，對於小部分的專門書用「精讀法」，對於大部分的常識書用『涉覽法」。</p>
<p>誰現誰後</p>
<p>至於怎樣參酌互用？或誰先誰後？那是隨着讀者的性質而有所不同的。簡言之，凡學問基礎未穩固的學生，應多注重精讀法，而少用涉覽法。凡在某種學問上已有相當基礎，而尙未至博大之程度者，應改變方針，在涉覽上多用工夫。總之，方法是因人而施，沒有嚴格的界綫的。</p>
<p>怎樣求精</p>
<p>『精讀』的入手法是　　—選讀什麼書？書旣選定，就當排定先後次序，按步就班的讀下去，又當之以恒，不可一書未畢，即讀他書·須知見異思遷，是精讀法的勁敵，讀者應切記弗忘。讀時又須細心咀嚼書中精　，務求澈底了解，毫無疑義。如發見其中有可懷疑之點，更當持此判的態度，多方加以探討，以求思想上的進步。其次的方法是在書本的重要處劃上綫條，以資辨認或注意；又可在書頁的邊緣寫上『眉批』，述說本人的感想，或綜述該段的大意，以備隨時查閱。最好是在筆記簿上另寫筆記，將某書一章或一節的大意，或其精采部分錄之於冊，以與其他參考資料對照研究；如能特本人對於所研究問題之感想或主張一併錄下，則尤可寳貴。</p>

<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>除了薛鳳春在和有功低低地說着話以外，大家都不出聲。</p>
<p>不久，全契都寫好了，兪篤問二手捧了起來，朗朗地讀着，從「立　契人王根明……」一直讀到。中華民國二十七年一月×日』的『立　契人王根明「和」見中楊子傑，保長陸柏棟，代筆兪篤周」。</p>
<p>大家聽了，沒有什麼異議，兪篤周就將契放在桌上，叫大家簽字。</p>
<p>黃崇菴從炕床上走下來，緩緩地出了書房門。大家似乎懂得他是失做什麼的，誰也沒有問他。</p>
<p>根明走過去，俯着身，左手壓在紙上，右手取了愈篤周給他的筆，按着兪篤周所指定的地點，將筆尖放下去，筆尖幌蕩不定，就好像風中的垂柳，被吹得忽高忽低，忽前忽後。用了極大的努力，他在紙上書了兩筆，一筆直，筆橫，交叉着，也像垂柳藉着風勢，在河邊的浮泥上，劃出了二條痕跡。</p>
<p>挨到陸柏棟　字時，另外費了一番氣力。原來他睡熟了，不知什麼時候他半倚着窗台，半倚着賬桌，睡熟了。幾次呼叫，推探，他才醒來，幾决的備促，逼迫，他才睡眼矇朧地在他的名字下面　了一僩慣用的「花字」。</p>
<p>大家的字畫好，黃崇菴也就回進來了，在桌上放下了一個紙包。楊子傑打開來，於是把了那一塊塊，有些微斑的，橫疊　的銀圓，一五一十地數到了六十七。（十六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial on Materials Mobilization <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Materials mobilization is an important part of total war participation, the significance of which and the principles of mobilization have been discussed yesterday. However, in order to achieve the greatest efficiency in mobilization, it is still necessary to pay attention to the fundamental ways. Because the materials stored by the country and the people are ultimately limited; and the consumption of military and civilian needs during wartime will increase day by day, inevitably leading to a situation of supply falling short of demand. Some people think that our country's distribution is uneven, circulation is uncoordinated, and consumption is not subject to appropriate restrictions, then the exhaustion of resources will be a matter of time. Moreover, in fact, in the six years since the incident, our country's materials have been in a state of being stretched. Now, please briefly describe the positive and negative countermeasures as follows:</p>
<p>On the positive side, it can be divided into two points: First, we must seek to increase materials, and first rely on the promotion of production. In addition to government agencies seeking production on their own, we must also encourage private production. Whether it is agriculture, industry, or mining, all that can be produced by the private sector should be vigorously encouraged and supported, and provided with convenience in terms of politics, finance, transportation, and sales. To be more specific. (1) For existing factories, workshops, and farms, we must urge them to make full use of their production capacity; if there are factories hoarding raw materials and not producing, or some landlords occupying fertile land and letting it lie barren, these phenomena must be quickly and reasonably guided to restore production. (2) Expand the industrial rationalization movement, that is, the rationalization of various industrial departments, regions, operating items, raw material acquisition, industrial management, product distribution, and mutual cooperation, etc. (3) Promote rural handicrafts and use rural idle labor to increase material production. (4) In order to encourage people to produce, the government should, when necessary, provide low-interest funds, provide equipment on behalf of the people, provide raw material guarantees, facilitate transportation, and introduce excellent technicians, and send personnel to guide them on a tour. However, the people's capital is limited, or they are unwilling to take risks, so for some industrial sectors, the government must operate them, but in view of the past failures of state-owned enterprises, in principle, "government supervision and private operation" should still be the main focus. Second, the circulation of existing materials and increased production materials is also an important issue: Within the peace zone, we must seek to balance surplus and deficiency, so unnecessary inspections should be eliminated, and taxes that only increase production obstacles should also be reduced.</p>
<p>On the negative side: The first is the issue of material distribution. The urgency of shipment and the amount of freight should be determined according to the needs of various regions and the importance of materials. Traffic tools should be used under the overall plan to rationalize material distribution. Secondly, our country's economic organization is scattered, especially among middlemen. Except for a few large cities, the amount of materials in stock and sales, wholesale prices and retail prices cannot be statistically analyzed. Therefore, the work of price stabilization is not easy to start. In order to adapt to this situation, it seems that certain daily necessities should be sold exclusively by the government or by merchants specially licensed by the government, so that the output, inventory and consumption of materials can be clearly understood. However, if the monopoly is implemented, there must be a private supervisory mechanism to avoid private fraud. In addition, the most worthwhile thing to promote is the cooperative movement, which can reduce the profits of middlemen and avoid price increases, and can eliminate the hoarding and manipulation of middlemen; it is not only beneficial to consumers, but also helps the material control agencies. The second is the issue of material consumption. The use of military supplies with very low inventory or output should be prohibited for the general public, and the quantity and use of materials that are not sufficient in output and have the possibility of shortage should be restricted for the people. For example, food should not be used for brewing alcohol. For improper or non-essential items, such as planting opium on land and the rotting of grain stored in warehouses, clear penalties should be stipulated. As for the conservation movement of public and private materials, efforts should be made to promote it.</p>
<p>Finally, all legislation and administration related to material circulation must first have a comprehensive and thorough investigation and statistics, and after sufficient research, can the results be perfect. And the simplification of wartime laws and regulations is a principle that cannot be ignored. Secondly, the material mobilization agencies must unify their powers and avoid mutual restraint; and the effectiveness of the implementation of government orders should be assessed in a timely manner, and rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. Materials mobilization is a major item of "total war participation," and we sincerely hope that government authorities and relevant parties will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Achievements of the Japanese Diet This Session <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>This session of the Japanese Diet passed a budget案 with a total expenditure of 47.4 billion yen, a new record in Japanese fiscal history (including 27 billion yen for temporary military expenditures), and also established 89 important bills such as the Wartime Special Exceptions Act. These many bills are necessary to adapt to the current decisive battle stage and reform and replace the necessary domestic system, which are not only epoch-making measures during wartime, but also important cases that should be resolutely implemented one by one in peacetime.</p>
<p>The most timely harvest of this session of the Diet was the elucidation of the road to victory in politics. At the beginning of the Diet, Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech on strengthening the government's guiding spirit of combat power, hoping that 100 million people would concentrate all their strength and fully utilize it, completely eliminated all complex intentions and concerns about the domestic system and united under a unified organization. At the same time, the government's clarified independence policy for Burma and the Philippines, as well as the epoch-making transformation of its China policy, are the basic national policies of the Japanese government, which were announced to the world by this session of the Diet.</p>
<p>In view of the achievements of the Diet, we keenly feel that the authorities and the people should encourage each other, be self-disciplined and self-motivated. The achievements of the Diet have established the moral politics and moral diplomacy internally and externally. In the pursuit of war, moral politics and moral diplomacy are often misunderstood as a retreat or even a weakening. However, when the Prime Minister implements wartime administration, he does not launch power, but completely trusts the people's self-consciousness and loyalty. Because the Prime Minister is convinced that the people's self-consciousness and loyalty are better than using power to promote them, and are the foundation for enhancing combat power. The true realization of the achievements of the Diet depends on the guidance of the authorities and the practice of the people. As for the diplomacy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the expansion of the spirit of morality and fairness and clarity is only half done, and the remaining half depends on the complete destruction of the United States, Britain, and the Chiang regime. In addition, the bills passed this time should be given special attention, such as the Wartime Administrative Special Bill, the Metropolitan System Bill, the Municipal and Village System Amendment Bill, and the Wartime Criminal Special Law Amendment Bill, etc. Their true value does not lie in the fact that they are established and completed, but in how they will be used in the future? In short, although this Diet has completed its mission, in order to make its achievements the foundation of the decisive battle system, the authorities should take the lead in demonstrating and leading in the future, and the people should follow and practice in the rear, and move forward.

<h3 id="e3">German Headquarters Announces Reoccupation of Belgrade; Soviet Troops Annihilated Southeast of Kharkov; Fierce Fighting Continues in Chuguev <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 19th, Havas News Agency: The German military communique this afternoon stated that our troops unexpectedly recaptured Belgrade, which is north of Kharkov and also a key railway junction. German troops northwest of Kursk are also advancing. The remaining Soviet troops surrounded southeast of Kharkov were annihilated yesterday. The "Greater Germany Infantry Division" repelled the attacking Soviet troops at Borisovka and advanced eastward again, destroying 47 Soviet tanks. South of Orel, the Soviet attacks on Vyazma and Staraya Russa were unsuccessful, and the enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources. Within the Vyazma area, the Soviet army lost 93 tanks. German troops assisted the German army in batches in combat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: The targets of the German counteroffensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front are known only to the German High Command. The claim by the Soviet High Command, British, and American visitors that the German army will advance to the Donets Front and then plan to break through the Donets River is purely speculation. The enemy has recently been publicizing the German army's plans for a large-scale offensive, the purpose of which is to confuse the public and cover up their defeat. Since the Soviet army's flanking actions on the Donets and Dnieper rivers have completely failed and the German army has reoccupied Kharkov, there are now no traces of the enemy on the Donets Front. A large number of troops southeast of Kharkov have been surrounded and annihilated by our army. Now the battle for Chuguev is underway. Further north, the vanguard of the German army has reached the upper reaches of the Donets River.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 19th, Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting continued in the central sector of the Eastern Front yesterday. In the Donets River basin, the German army, assisted by fresh troops, is launching fierce attacks in the vicinity of Izyum and Chuguev, which may expand into a pincer offensive against the city of Kupyansk. The Red Army is resisting strongly and counterattacking continuously. According to announcements by Moscow Radio, there has been "significant improvement" in the Red Army's positions in the Donets River basin. Further north, there is still fierce fighting on the Kharkov-Belgorod railway. The Red Army has received cavalry reinforcements. The battle launched near Seversk is now expanding. The German army's goal is to clear the 80-mile Red Army salient west of Kursk. The final goal is the city of Kursk. The two armies are deadlocked in a decisive battle. On the Orel front, the Red Army is constantly launching fierce attacks. South of Vyazma, the German army is still adjusting its lines to avoid contact with the Red Army. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army's target is the city of Kirov, a railway hub on the Vyazma-Smolensk line.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Cultural Delegation to Visit China at the End of the Month; To Attend Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Conference; To Present "Great Unity Song" to Chairman Wang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Domei News Agency: It was learned today that the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has scheduled a three-day national congress in Nanjing in April to celebrate the return of the capital by the National Government. Ten Japanese representatives will participate. These ten people are dispatched by the Japan International Cultural Relations Association and represent the cultural, scientific, and educational activities of Japan during the war. The association has also invited Ryozo Hiranuma, a veteran of the Japanese sports world and a member of the House of Peers, and the famous military writer Hino to attend the meeting. It is reported that the Japanese ambassador to Nanjing, Shigemitsu, is quite concerned about this plan and has asked the Greater East Asia Ministry to help him succeed. The delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at the end of March to attend the cultural conference and will also participate in round-table conferences and lectures in Nanjing and neighboring cities to promote cultural relations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: Dr. Atsushi Shioya (Professor Emeritus of Tokyo Imperial University), head of the Japanese cultural delegation to China, and his party will depart for Nanjing on the evening of the 22nd. Dr. Shioya is carrying a treasured copy of the "Great Unity Song" to present to Chairman Wang and Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. The book is the posthumous work of Dr. Shioya's great-grandfather, On Yain Shioya, and was carefully written by Dr. Shioya's father (former professor of the First Higher School), Tokitoshi Shioya, so it is extremely valuable. The so-called "Great Unity Song" means "Emperor's Song." The entire text is in classical Chinese, with four characters per line, and records the events of the successive emperors of Japan, starting from Emperor Jinmu and ending with Emperor Komei, detailing the names of the emperors and the great meaning of loyalty and filial piety, and expounding the origins of the Japanese national polity. It can be called an immortal masterpiece. During the late Tokugawa shogunate, it was popular in rural schools, and every household recited it. After the Meiji era, Sinology gradually declined, and it was gradually forgotten, only treasured in the Shioya family's library. According to Dr. Shioya, "I am convinced that it is most appropriate to introduce the Japanese national polity with this book. My great-grandfather, On Yain, carefully wrote this book up to the generation of Emperor Komei and passed away in the third year of Keio. Therefore, the generation of Emperor Meiji was respectfully supplemented by my father, Aoyama (Tokitoshi Shioya's other name)."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: Tetsutaro Kawakami, a member of the Japanese cultural delegation to China participating in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital and a representative of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, recently discussed the purpose of his visit to China before departing the country, saying, "Our party will soon participate in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital as Japanese cultural envoys and attend the congress of representatives from various regions of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. I still remember that when the first Greater East Asia Writers' Conference was held, Chinese and Japanese cultural figures had intimate talks and exchanged various opinions on the issue of Greater East Asia culture. Many proposals were made at that time, and it is necessary to realize them. I hope that the exchange of writers' works and the establishment of a joint Sino-Japanese literary research institution can be realized as soon as possible. I have heard that China is planning to establish a literary institution like our country's Literary Patriotic Association. I believe this matter will be realized soon. After arriving in China, I plan to have more contact with Chinese cultural figures, have frank discussions, exchange opinions, provide spiritual assistance, and form good friends in the Greater East Asia literary world. Today's Sino-Japanese cooperation is a rare phenomenon since the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the cultures of China and Japan should trust each other and strive to build a Greater East Asia culture. Therefore, I plan to take this opportunity to visit China to promote the awareness of cultural figures in Chongqing and to enable them to participate in the Second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to exchange views on the issue of Greater East Asia culture."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th, Domei News Agency: The newly appointed President of the Central China Development Company, Kikujiro Takashima, recently stated that Sino-Japanese relations should be based on mutual trust and harmony, not just a military alliance. As practical developments have shown, the close relationship between China and Japan is like that of a married couple. Both are now doing their best to win this historic war.

<h3 id="e6">Conflicts Between Chongqing and the Communists Worsen <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency: According to reports, Chongqing is currently actively carrying out the so-called "Centralization" work to speed up the development of the Northwest. However, due to frequent frictions and conflicts between Chongqing and the Communists, its attempt to develop the Northwest has been greatly hampered. Because the Chongqing Party and the Communist Party are vying for power in the Northwest, disputes often arise. Recently, the disputes between the two sides have intensified due to the issue of developing the Northwest, which has a great impact on the war situation. In order to ease the conflict between the two sides, Chongqing Chiang sent Feng Yuxiang to meet with Mao Zedong and Zhu De, intending to mediate. However, because the Communist Party hates the Chongqing Party to the bone, its attitude is also extremely tough, so Feng Yuxiang's trip yielded no results. After returning to Chongqing on the 10th, he reported the process and the Communist Party's opinions to Chongqing Chiang.</p>

<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency: On the 16th and 17th, the Japanese Air Force thoroughly bombed Wanxian and Laohukou, the key point of the 5th War Zone of the Chongqing Army. On the 18th, it dispatched again to attack the military resistance strongholds of the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing Army, such as Gong'an, Shashi, the area around Zhangtiansi south of Huarong, Jiangbodu, and the west side of Ouchikou, destroying the Chongqing Army's attempt to resist. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese Air Force realized that the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing Army continued to stir. On the 18th, it launched a large-scale air raid on various areas of the Chongqing Army and machine-gunned the Chongqing Army in various places such as the area around Huarong, the west side of Ouchikou, and Jiangbodu, defeating about 500 Chongqing troops west of Ouchikou and about 100 Chongqing troops at Jiangbodu.

<p>Guangzhou, 18th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Air Force has recently intensified its activities, not only inflicting heavy blows on Chongqing, but also causing the prestige of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to suffer significant damage. According to information received here indirectly, the commander of the 14th Air Force of Chongqing, Major General Chennault, boasted on March 15 that "Let us wipe out the traces of the Japanese Air Force in the Chinese sky." This was the grand statement he made at a banquet in front of the leaders of Chongqing when he took office. At that time, all the leaders were moved by his courageous words, but in the past few days, Japanese aircraft have bombed Wanxian in Sichuan and Guilin in Guangxi, as well as other forward bases of the US Air Force, every day, dropping countless fierce bombs. According to later reports, the military authorities of Chongqing are now severely criticizing the US commander's attitude, exaggerating and not living up to his words, and pointing out that when Japanese aircraft recently attacked, no US aircraft dared to rise up to fight the Japanese aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e13">British Attack on Northern Section of Mareth Line Repelled; German Troops Penetrate Deep into British Positions in the North <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: The British Eighth Army attacked the coastal area along the Mareth Line twice on Tuesday evening and Wednesday, and were repelled both times. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The enemy had two purposes for this attack: (1) to clear the minefields of the German and Italian forward positions; (2) if successful, the enemy could penetrate deep into our positions as a preliminary step to launching a general offensive on the entire line. However, this objective was not only not achieved, but also suffered a strong counterattack by the German army, resulting in the loss of the positions previously occupied by the enemy. General Montgomery had to withdraw his general offensive order. The British army is now concentrated in the Calonlai area to prevent the flanking attack of the Axis forces. The terrain in this area is difficult and desert-like, and is not suitable for large-scale battles by the enemy. On the contrary, this type of terrain is very conducive to the mobile defense tactics of the Axis forces.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Domei News Agency: There were no major battles in Tunisia on Wednesday. In the past twelve hours, it had been windy and rainy, and the ground was muddy, which greatly hindered the actions of the Allied forces and the Axis forces in North Africa. However, the elite troops of the British Eighth Army attacked the coastal defense zone of the Mareth Line from Tuesday night to the next morning and on Wednesday, and were heavily damaged and retreated. It is reported that the attacking British troops were infantry units, with no tanks to assist them. However, heavy artillery was used to bombard them before the attack. After the British army slightly invaded the Mareth Line, the German army launched a counterattack. The British army suffered heavy casualties and could not maintain the occupied territory. The entire offensive was terminated. However, the British army's cessation of the attack is probably only temporary in nature. The British artillery is still bombarding the German positions.</p>
<p>Central Tunisia: Change of US Commander</p>
<p>Tangier, 19th, Havas News Agency: News from Algiers, Allied Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower has now appointed Lieutenant General Patton as the US Commander in Central Tunisia. Lieutenant General Patton is known for commanding tank operations. When the Allied forces landed in French North Africa in November last year, it was Patton who commanded them. Later, he was appointed as the US tank commander in North Africa.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency: On the central front of Tunisia, according to the war report of the Allied Headquarters in North Africa, the US troops advanced from Feirianna to Gafsa yesterday afternoon and did not encounter any resistance. They crossed six miles beyond Gafsa and occupied the city of Lora in the southeast corner of the Galorechi Mountain. They are now carefully observing El Guettar, which is twelve miles from Gafsa. The German army has probably established a position there. When the German army abandoned Gafsa, it was filled with mines and traps, and the US engineers were very busy clearing them. According to German sources, fresh American troops are being concentrated west of Osertia and Bison.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: Responsible sources in military circles here declared that the German army launched an offensive towards Abariit in the coastal area of northern Tunisia yesterday, penetrating deep into the British positions. The British army urgently dispatched reinforcements to the front line, and the trucks they were traveling in were continuously attacked by German aircraft. In addition to defeating most of the British and American troops, the German army also captured a large number of prisoners of war and spoils.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) After arriving here on the 18th, Myanmar's Administrative Governor Bhamo and his party, at 10 AM on the 19th, proceeded from the Prime Minister's annex to the Imperial Palace to pay their respects. After departing from the palace, they returned to the annex to rest.</p>
<p>Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency) The news of Governor Bhamo's party's arrival in Tokyo on the evening of the 18th coincided with the first day of the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival, the largest festival in Myanmar. The breaking news spread throughout Myanmar, and the people were exceptionally jubilant. Governor Bhamo, Interior Minister Dakhin Mya, Finance Minister Dai Yinmo, and Myanmar Defense Army Commander Major General Aung San, the four leaders of the new Myanmar, departed from an airfield on the morning of the 10th at the invitation of Japan. Few knew of this, so the sudden announcement from Tokyo of Governor Bhamo's party's arrival in Japan filled the people of Myanmar with joy and gratitude amidst solemnity.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Myanmar, with the help of the Japanese army, was liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States. Now, the new Myanmar has become a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with a future full of limitless hope. As Governor Bhamo of Myanmar visits Japan, here is a brief account of the revival of Myanmar as an introduction. Myanmar is currently at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War and is also the western gateway to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It borders Thailand and Vietnam to the east, Yunnan to the north, and India across the Arakan Mountains to the west. Therefore, Myanmar is no less than the heart of the Southern Sphere. After the Japanese army captured Singapore, Yangon became a stronghold for Britain, the United States, and Chongqing. When Dr. Bhamo heard in Moghdat prison on March 8th last year that the Japanese army had captured Yangon, he was overjoyed, believing that the liberation of Myanmar would be completed. After the military administration personnel arrived in Yangon on the 25th of that month, they immediately began security work in southern Myanmar. Subsequently, on June 8th, after the Japanese army pacified all of Myanmar, Lieutenant General Iida, the highest commander of the Japanese army in Myanmar, announced the commencement of military administration and appointed Dr. Bhamo and others as preparatory committee members of the central administrative organ. When the British-Indian army retreated, they set fires and plundered various places in central and northern Myanmar, turning major cities such as Mandalay into ruins. However, through the efforts of the Japanese army and the people of Myanmar, Mandalay was the first to be revived. Now, major markets and shops have all been restored, and railway stations and Irrawaddy River docks have also been rebuilt, with prosperity unchanged from the past. The central part of the city, Taunggyi, was spared from the ravages of war. After transportation was restored, various places near the area transported large quantities of vegetables and other goods to various places in southern Myanmar. Prom, a key location on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, and towns downstream such as Pyay, have also been restored as rice distribution centers. When the Japanese army occupied Yangon, Mawlamyine and other places had already been revived, and residents gradually returned. The city's situation is no different from the past. Various cities such as Lashio, Taungoo, Myitkyina, and other provinces are also actively reviving.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Muslims Enthusiastically Celebrate the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Jakarta, 19th (Central News Agency) Today is the birthday of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Javanese Muslims are fasting, abstaining from food, or going to mosques to pray, or going to the suburbs to pray remotely to Mecca. They are all enthusiastically rejoicing. However, the significance of this year's celebration is completely different from the purely religious rituals of the past. Various ceremonies are filled with wartime colors, demonstrating the vigorous spirit of striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When the Japanese army swept across Java in February last year, they were liberated from their shackles, so they welcomed the Japanese army with food and drink and did their best to cooperate in post-war reconstruction. The Japanese army also extremely respected their Islamic faith. Even in the midst of the war, they cooperated in protecting mosques everywhere. This made them exceptionally grateful. On March 7th last year, the Japanese army issued Proclamation No. 2, clarifying the Japanese army's determination to respect the religious beliefs of the residents and decided to actively assist in the healthy development of Muslims. They believed that cooperation with the Japanese army must begin with self-discipline among Muslims. On Fridays, believers gather in mosques and pray fervently, with absolute trust in the Japanese army. After the Greater East Asia War entered its second year, in addition to enthusiastically cooperating in the construction of Java, Muslims also paid close attention to the Islamic dynamics in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When they received the news of the death of General Hayashi Senjūrō, the former chairman of the Japan Islamic Association, Javanese Muslims were deeply saddened and sent a telegram of condolence from the headquarters of the Indonesian Islamic Supreme Council to General Hayashi's family. On the anniversary of the Japanese army's landing on the first of this month, a grand convention of Islamic representatives from the entire island was convened in Jakarta to hold a grand victory prayer. After hearing that Japanese Minister for East Asia Aoki and various foreign ministers clarified Japan's fundamental policy towards Muslims in the south in parliament last month, they immediately sent a telegram to express their gratitude. In short, Javanese Muslims are now echoing Muslims in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, exerting their full strength to complete the great mission of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency) Three thousand Muslims in and around this area held a solemn ceremony here on the 19th to celebrate the Prophet's birthday. Amin and Akya, professors of Islam, delivered speeches expressing their gratitude for the Japanese army's kindness in protecting Muslims and emphasized that Muslims should fully发挥their inherent spirit and actively assist Japan. The participating Muslims were deeply moved.</p>

This year, in order to save resources, the Ministry of Commerce has refused to allocate leg painting raw materials to manufacturers, so women "painting legs" will temporarily disappear this summer.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Comprehensive Review of This Session of the Japanese Parliament; The Guiding Power of the Cabinet is Increasingly Strengthened <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>About four weeks have passed since the reopening of the 81st Japanese Parliament. Amid internal and external scrutiny, various parliamentary matters are being conducted: the House of Representatives completed all bills on the 8th, and the House of Peers also completed all remaining bills on the 10th, and adjourned on the 11th. This parliament coincides with the year of the decisive battle, so its significance is rarely seen in previous parliaments, and its achievements are also rare in previous parliaments. Judging only from the established budgets and bills, the total expenditure of the next year's budgets is 47.4 billion yen, including 27 billion yen for temporary military expenses, which is an unprecedented decisive battle budget in Japanese financial history. In addition, as many as 89 laws under the wartime special exceptions bill are landmark measures related to enhancing combat power in the midst of changing the domestic system. Therefore, at a time when world war is in full swing, the direction of decisive battle politics based on the Japanese spirit has been clarified due to the establishment of these bills, which is the greatest gain of this parliament.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Clear Explanation</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, successive cabinets have tried to rebuild Japan's politics in the direction of carrying out the war. Such as the unity of command and state affairs, the strengthening of the Prime Minister's administrative powers, the unification of central and local administrative institutions, as well as reorganizing parliamentary forces into a supportive form, strengthening economic control, and planning domestic unity, all these attempts, although also driven by the world trend in turbulent times, are undoubtedly what the recent Japanese cabinet has been committed to. At the same time, it is also the goal of the various bills submitted in this parliament. What kind of basis is this shift to war politics really based on? Is there a risk of leaning towards dictatorial politics? Are there drastic changes in administrative institutions and corresponding enterprise forms? Such questions and concerns were raised by members of parliament. In response, Prime Minister Tojo clearly explained the government's beliefs. At the beginning of the reopening of this parliament, Prime Minister Tojo stated the government's basic attitude towards decisive battle politics in his policy speech: "Regarding the enhancement of combat power, the government's guiding spirit is to expect the vigorous power of 100 million compatriots to be fully utilized." And in the budget general meeting of both houses and the wartime administrative special exceptions bill committee, he strongly stated the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The government's attitude in implementing wartime administration is not to launch power, but to thoroughly trust the people's awareness and loyalty.</p>
<p>(2) The strengthening of the Prime Minister's powers is not dictatorship. According to the Japanese national polity, there is no room for considering other countries' dictatorships.</p>
<p>(3) Drastic reforms of the cabinet system and administrative institutions are detrimental to enhancing combat power and will not be adopted.</p>
<p>(4) When strengthening economic control, such as national management of important industries, reform of economic forms, etc., will not be implemented, and the creativity of the people will be utilized as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) Promote the spirit of rewarding merits and punishing demerits in official circles.</p>
<p>Under the severe war situation of this continuous war, single-mindedly promoting Japanese politics suitable for the national polity, thereby firmly uniting the whole country to cope with this next war period, the great road of this winning politics can be said to have been revealed in principle.</p>
<p>However, this decisive war political Japanese character is by no means weakening the government's war-fighting posture, is by no means allowing arbitrary actions by a part of the political forces, and is by no means causing a temporary retreat in the progress of economic control. The following four points make this clear. Namely, (1) Prime Minister Tojo strongly stated in the House of Representatives the completeness of the political and military posture, and expressed his determination to concurrently serve as Army Minister, (2) Stir up the discussion of the wartime administrative special exceptions law, and reveal the outline of strengthening the Prime Minister's powers and the administrative unification of super-priority industries, (3) In the House of Peers, it was stated that malicious rumors that disrupt domestic unity will never be borrowed and will be cracked down on. (4) Minister of Commerce Kishi further made the following assertion: "In the future, in order to increase production, strengthening control and making production more planned is absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>The True Meaning of Decisive Battle Diplomacy</p>
<p>At a time when Japan's domestic and foreign affairs are being unified with the Greater East Asia as the axis, Japan's promotion of war politics is not only limited to the domestic political sphere, but also in the administration of occupied territories and in the diplomacy of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is progressing with groundbreaking policies based on the spirit of national founding. This policy has been specifically clarified through parliament. Prime Minister Tojo's major statement on the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines in his policy speech has given great impact to the regions and ethnic groups under occupation. Furthermore, the Japanese government's morally based statements to the countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere are guaranteed by the policies currently being implemented, enough to make them understand Japan's determination and true intentions.</p>
<p>Especially regarding the policy towards China, with the Guomindang government's participation in the war as an opportunity, Japan's policy has undergone a groundbreaking transformation, such as the complete abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of concessions, and the ongoing political, economic, and other strong support. The government's statement in parliament has attracted great attention. As for Minister Aoki's policies on currency and exchange rates, and Director-General Sato of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau detailed explanations on Japan's measures after the policy transformation and its profound impact in Chongqing and other enemy countries. In short, thoroughly respecting China's autonomy and independence, supporting the National Government to strengthen its political power, so that Japan and China become one, and marching towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War, Japan's fair attitude has been proven in fact and clarified at home and abroad.</p>
<p>On the contrary, "the only rebel in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Wang Jingwei regime, can only be resolutely annihilated," this is the response of Minister Aoki and Director-General Sato in parliament, and it must not be forgotten. Also, the Prime Minister's statement: "For the countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere who are willing to cooperate with us, we will always support them with parental affection and sincerity, but for those who do not understand our true intentions and are willing to be messengers of Britain and the United States, we will take resolute measures," can be said to reveal the true meaning of decisive battle diplomacy, and it can be expected that it will consistently advance the politics of Greater East Asia in a grand manner based on Japan's principles, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>The Organizational Law of Political Promotion</p>
<p>Most of the important laws passed and established by this parliament can be said to be organizational laws that strongly promote this kind of politics, so those who are in official positions should恪遵the original intention of the legislation and respect the government's statements in parliament in order to reflect and be vigilant and apply them appropriately. Only in this way will the people's loyalty be further ignited, and the new politics of decisive battle breakthrough will be more firmly established.</p>
<p>This parliament is the second regular parliament under the Greater East Asia War. The previous 79th regular parliament was held amid the brilliant victories of the initial battles. The people's attention was focused on the progress of the war, and the bills submitted by the government were limited to the urgent measures of the present, with little room for discussion; however, this time it was held in the second year of the war, in the decisive battle period, when all enemy strongholds in Greater East Asia belonged to Japan, and the stage was set to build a long-term winning domestic posture. The number of government proposals was far more than before, and their content was centered on enhancing the combat power of the people in the rear, involving many points. The government officials who are at the forefront of the application of these laws, how they are expected, from the position of smooth public opinion, it is natural that the discussion will be boiling, which can be said to have been expected at the beginning.</p>
<p>Activities Surrounding the Yokusan Political Association</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that this parliament is the regular parliament held since last spring's general election and the so-called "gathering of domestic political forces". The Yokusan Political Association, the only political association, was established recently, and only in terms of the great unity of the whole country, the control has not been meticulous and the cohesion is not strong. Although there is no disagreement in its basic direction of cooperating with the government and trying to carry out the war, its various activities on individual issues have surfaced before the parliament. Moreover, the political mechanism called the government, the Yokusan Political Association, and the Yokusan Support Association as a trinity, what kind of relationship do they have with each other? How will they act in the future? The future political activities of the Yokusan Political Association are a major issue, so it is only through this parliament that its trend can be clarified, and this expectation can be said to be natural.</p>
<p>The various activities within the Yokusan Political Association that were revealed in front of the parliament correspond to the above-mentioned characteristics of this parliament. Namely, (1) comprehensively dealing with the urgent issue of enhancing combat power under the decisive battle, thereby endowing the stagnant Yokusan Political Association with a firm direction for political activities in order to鞭挞the government, which is the activity of the Seishin Club, the 30th Day Club, the Economic Assembly of Parliamentarians, etc. (2) Reforming the internal structure of the Yokusan Political Association, clarifying the location of its responsibilities, and establishing a domestic political mechanism integrating the Yokusan Political Association and the Yokusan Support Association, which is the hope of the young and middle-aged factions. (3) Should review whether the various bills submitted by the government are urgent bills directly related to enhancing combat power, which is the strong argument of some members of parliament. These are all regarded as激昂意见的.</p>
<p>The 81st Parliament reopened in this situation, so the revision theory raised its head for the problematic bills, such as the revised law in the wartime criminal special law, the revised law in the capital system, the city system, the revised law in the towns and villages, the Japan Securities Exchange Law, the Agricultural Group Law, the Fisheries Group Law, etc., were all brought to its俎上. This is more like a phenomenon of repeated political coordination due to the lack of consensus within the Yokusan Political Association than pursuing the government's statement: it is more about dealing with the problems within the Yokusan Political Association than the problems with the government. Therefore, the cooperative posture between the government and the parliament has not been fundamentally affected in any way, while the Yokusan Political Association has left problems for the future and can be regarded as promoting the desire to establish a strong internal mechanism.</p>
<p>The Government's Frank Attitude</p>
<p>Towards the above-mentioned parliamentary　勢, the government, from the beginning, adopted a fair and frank attitude to explain its policies, and conversely, towards retreating arguments, it consistently adopted a resolute attitude. In the pre-examination of the bills, the government also submitted the bills that became the focus of discussion in accordance with the established policy without hesitation, and Prime Minister Tojo, supporting his sick body, entered the hospital and declared to the world his determination to win the war with the groundbreaking policy speech at the reopening of the parliament, which began with "This year is the autumn of the decisive battle". The Prime Minister also expressed his belief in domestic unity at the main meeting of the nobles on February 1, and expressed his determination to concurrently serve as Minister of the Army at the budget general meeting on the 2nd, sweeping away the arguments. Regarding important political issues, the Prime Minister also repeatedly took the field and spoke in the committee with an attitude full of confidence.</p>
<p>Confirming the Government's Superiority</p>
<p>Although the parliamentary situation is extremely diverse, as mentioned above, its sincere discussions and positive cooperation with the government have broken away from the old pattern of the parliament seeming to be opposed to the government and embarked on the first step of rebuilding the Japanese parliament. On the other hand, the superior position of the government executing war politics has also been gradually confirmed on the floor. Moreover, among the laws passed and established by this parliament, the wartime administrative special exceptions law strengthens the powers of the Prime Minister and unifies production administration; the local system improvement law centralizes administrative powers and increases the superiority of the executive organs over the decision-making organs. In addition, the various laws concerning the economy aim at strengthening control and administrative speed. From this point of view, the strengthening of the cabinet's leadership can finally be realized through the implementation of these laws. Therefore, in decisive battle politics, the relationship between the government and the parliament will clarify each other's positions through this parliament, it is not an overstatement.</p>
<p>In this parliament, the discussion of the Yokusan Political Association problem never went beyond the past criticisms of elections, etc., which is a bit of a low tone. However, this was stopped by the difficulties of some members of parliament after all. Moreover, the arguments that completely deny the Yokusan Political Association and various national organizations related to national movements have disappeared, which can be said to be the parliament's progress on national organizations.

<p>Following approval from the military administration for oil rationing by population through the Wholesale Bureau of Edible Oil, the issuance of edible oil permits has been entrusted to the Food Management Bureau of the Public Works Department of the Zhou Family Cemetery Administration. All edible oil retailers, such as soy sauce manufacturers, distilleries, oil shops, and sauce-wine shops, have completed re-registration, been assigned registration numbers, and designated as edible oil retailers. Agreements have also been reached with various oil pressing factories. All oil pressed by these factories will be purchased by the military administration for allocation to the Edible Oil Wholesale Bureau, providing oil for rationing by population and for the business needs of various industries. The authorities will find ways to supply raw materials to the oil pressing factories, such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanuts, and cottonseed. Recently, eight factories, including the Japanese-owned Nikka Oil Manufacturing Company, Japan Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd., Southern China Industrial Company, Taishan Oil Factory, Universal Oil Factory, Yoshida Oil Factory, Great Japan Oil Company, and Minhang Oil Pressing Plant, as well as four Chinese-owned oil pressing factories, have been allocated raw materials and are hastening oil production. The produced oil has been packed in iron drums and stored in designated oil depots, ready for allocation to retailers based on edible oil permits. Once the procedures for rationing by population are ready, a public announcement will be made for implementation, allowing purchases with the first coupon of the edible oil permit. Prices will be in accordance with the new prices announced on March 1st. It is expected to be implemented before the end of March. If preparations for rationing by population are insufficient, there may be another sale once according to the old method, allowing residents to purchase freely.</p>

<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu came to Shanghai on the 17th of this month for official business. Yesterday (19th) at 4:30 PM, he held a reception at the Broadway Mansions for the local Chinese press corps. Attendees included Mr. Tagiri, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Shimizu, Vice-Consul Fukushima, Interpreter Masaki, and over ten reporters from various newspapers. Ambassador Shigemitsu began by expressing his heartfelt pleasure at meeting with the press. He intends to visit Shanghai once a month in the future. Although his stay this time is short, he has witnessed general improvements in Shanghai, especially in the economic sphere. This is due to the active cooperation of Shanghai's economic leaders, for which he expresses his immense satisfaction. He hopes to see further progress in Shanghai's situation when he visits next time, and Japan will fully assist in China's efforts towards reconstruction. He further stated that his expectation of China is nothing more than that the Chinese people will work hard to revive China and cooperate with Japan in East Asia to complete the Greater East Asia War and jointly build a New East Asia. Regarding the issue of returning the International Settlement, Ambassador Shigemitsu replied to reporters that Japan signed an agreement with China on January 9th to return the Japanese-administered concessions and signed detailed provisions of the agreement on the 14th of this month. He hopes that the issue of returning the International Settlement can be concluded in the shortest possible time to meet the expectations of the Chinese government and people. Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights, China has long hoped for it and aims to abolish unequal treaties. Japan has also had similar experiences in the past, but after years of effort, it has shaken off this restriction. Now is the time for China. On January 9th, Japan was the first to declare the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, and China's friendly nations have followed suit. He hopes to see it materialize soon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted Japanese journalists yesterday, he stated that Prime Minister Tojo's recent visit to China will cause a major reaction among the general Chinese population, as they will understand the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>

<p>The 30th period household rice is entirely white rice and contains no brown rice or broken rice. This white rice includes (1) domestically produced Du rice, (2) Wuhu Yangxian rice, and (3) Thai and Vietnamese Yang rice, with a quantity of two and a half liters. As for the prices received by the rice shops, according to the purchase order regulations, each bag of rice is 308.6 yuan, and each bag of flour is 92 yuan. The price of the 30th period household rice has slightly increased to 300 yuan per dan, so the receiving price of each rice shop will inevitably be adjusted accordingly. However, the receiving price of each rice shop is temporarily kept at the old price. The adjustment will be made up at the end of March when the rice and flour payments are settled.</p>

<p>A local dispatch from the Domei News Agency reports that Sohtaro Ishiwatari, the National Government's Supreme Economic Advisor, stated to the press at the Cathay Hotel yesterday afternoon that since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, general commodity prices have started to decline. Advisor Ishiwatari also stated that to strengthen the National Government's wartime economic policies, the number of Japanese economic advisors stationed throughout the country would be increased. Regarding currency system issues, he hoped that in the near future, the official exchange rate between savings certificates and yen (excluding military scrip) would be specified, namely 18 yen to 100 savings certificates. At the same time, the exchange rate between Central Bank savings certificates and joint notes would also be specified. After the merger of military scrip and savings certificates, the exchange rate between yen and savings certificates would be specified as 18 yen to 100 savings certificates. At that time, due to the merger of the two currencies, the number of savings certificates would increase, but this would not be currency inflation. Regarding Central Bank savings certificates and joint banknotes, the Chinese and Japanese governments are conducting research and will make concrete decisions. Food purchases are currently managed by the Ministry of Food but will soon be transferred to the National Commercial Control Association. To raise sufficient funds to purchase food, the National Government will soon issue food treasury bonds. At the same time, issuing prize-winning lottery tickets is also being planned. Mr. Ishiwatari will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou today (Saturday).</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e35">Ambassador Shigemitsu's Words; Expecting China's Revival <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted the Chinese press corps yesterday and made a speech with two main points. He said, "I have witnessed the general improvement of Shanghai's situation, especially in the economic sphere, which is due to the active cooperation of Shanghai's economic leaders." He also said, "My expectation of China is nothing more than that the Chinese people will work hard to revive China." We believe that Ambassador Shigemitsu's words are not flattery but sincere hopes. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we cannot help but feel the great responsibility to the country and must be doubly vigilant.</p>
<p>First, the new economic measures in Shanghai this time are only preliminary reforms in the process of experimentation. The main reason for this, as the ambassador said, is "due to the active cooperation of economic leaders." But on the other hand, it is also because these measures are suitable for the current environment that there are these reforms. Therefore, all economic measures - and even all political, social, and other measures - if they are to be effective, must have two preconditions: (1) full cooperation between the people and the government; (2) suitability to the environment at that time and place; otherwise, they will inevitably be in vain. This valuable conclusion of experimentation can be used as a guideline for Sino-Japanese relations and the efforts of the government and the people in the future. The economic measures in Shanghai this time are only preliminary reforms, and complete success still depends on the continued efforts of both the Chinese and Japanese governments and people.</p>
<p>Second, Ambassador Shigemitsu expects the Chinese people to work hard to revive China, and we strongly agree. The revival of China certainly depends on the efforts of the Chinese people themselves; however, under the current situation, frankly speaking, half of it also depends on the sincere assistance of friendly nations everywhere and giving the Chinese people full freedom to develop. The revival of China is also the key to the revival of East Asia. We have accepted Ambassador Shigemitsu's sincere and hopeful words, which have deeply aroused endless self-encouragement.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Wartime Frugal Consumption <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>"Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure" has been the only solution in Chinese financial management since ancient times. If this sentence is used as the principle of the wartime economy, it is even more appropriate, because one aspect of the wartime economy is to focus on increasing production, and the other aspect is to focus on frugal consumption. If production increases as much as possible, but consumption cannot be frugal, the result will make the advancement of production power in vain and will not help wartime economic construction.</p>
<p>The solution to social problems, especially wartime social problems, cannot be achieved solely by relying on some principles and some laws. The most important thing is to rely on people from all walks of life in society, while the government takes the position of guidance and supervision. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association this time is the best precedent for various sectors of society to jointly assist in solving social problems. Undoubtedly, the main task of this institution is to adjust the supply and demand relationship of materials, and it must take promoting production as its prerequisite issue. However, what we cannot ignore most is that in addition to promoting production, we must advocate frugality. Looking around the countries of the world during the war, which country is not striving for frugal consumption? To cite one or two examples, in Japan, those who go to restaurants and restaurants cannot escape heavy taxes. In France, the most appealing dance halls and nightclubs are cancelled at all costs. These are necessary measures for frugal consumption and are worthy of imitation.</p>
<p>In any case, in the process of implementing the wartime economy, frugal consumption and increased production must be planned and considered at the same time and complement each other. Rejecting extravagance must be regarded as a necessary condition during the war, and saving on food and clothing should also be regarded as an obligation to be fulfilled during the war. We believe that frugal consumption is most closely related to the entire wartime economic problem, and we hope that the government will actively promote it and the people will cooperate universally. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, it seems appropriate for the government to organize a Mass Frugal Consumption Guidance Committee, and for appropriate figures to be selected from the private sector to assist the government in publicizing, guiding, and promoting such an important movement; in necessary situations, the government should enforce it compulsorily, and it should also be regarded as a reasonable action.</p>

<h3 id="e44">New Central Savings Society - Supervisory Committee Formally Established - Held First Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Transfer Matters <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The Supervisory Committee of the New Central Savings Society was formally established yesterday and held its first supervisory committee meeting to receive its asset and liability schedules and business account books. The supervisors present at the meeting included Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Zhenxiu, Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Pei Fuheng, Yang Xinghua, Ren Xishun (Li Da was absent due to illness), Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, Shao Shijun, and others, totaling fourteen people. Zhang Xisan and Zhou Shaojian attended as observers. First, Zhou Zuzhen, the deputy manager of the society, reported on the business situation and the situation since the military administration on January 9 of last year, as well as a list of all assets and liabilities. Then, they discussed the reorganization and establishment of the organizational system of the New Central Savings Society and the future direction for promoting business. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM. The Central Savings Society was established in April of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) with a fund of 5 million yuan allocated by the former Chongqing Central Trust Bureau. It has been more than seven years since then. In addition to branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and other places, there are also many sub-branches throughout the country. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8, 1941, the Chongqing Central Trust Bureau took over the liquidation. The Central Savings Society thus became completely independent in accounting. On January 9 of last year, it was managed by the Japanese army, continuing business and preserving the rights and interests of general depositors. Now, the Japanese army has lifted the management and returned it to our government. With the approval of the government by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Reserve Bank is preparing to allocate funds to take over and reorganize it into the New Central Savings Society, which was formally established yesterday to continue business. All original depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident, after completing legal procedures, can continue their rights and interests. It is understood that the various organizational departments of the society after the reorganization will remain the same, with little change. However, the savings portion of the business department will be separated and a separate savings department will be established to handle all savings business. It is reported that in terms of personnel, in addition to the already designated Li Da as the general manager, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Xisan, and Zhou Shaojian as deputy managers, and Deng Yiyuan and Xiao Pei as assistant managers, all other personnel in various departments will remain the same and will not be changed.</p>

<p>The number of newly established financial institutions in February continues to spring up like mushrooms after rain. Just considering banks and money shops, the number will reach seventy. There are also many enterprise companies and insurance companies. It is also heard that many of these newly established financial institutions have not obtained approval from the authorities, and it is necessary to take measures to rectify the situation in order to ensure the soundness of the financial sector in the city. The number of newly established financial and general commercial institutions is listed below: 1. Banks: 34 (including 3 branch banks). 2. Money Shops: 35. 3. Insurance Companies: 6. 4.

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th - Regarding the issue of general materials being moved in and out, and whether the National Government's announcement of the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association will also entail the establishment of branches in various locations, various parties still lack a full understanding of this. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Minister of Industry and Commerce Mei to request an explanation, which was answered as follows: (1) Except for rice, materials in general can be freely moved in and out of various regions without any restrictions. This measure has been implemented since the 16th of this month. However, what is hoped of merchants and the public is, firstly, not to create hoarding of materials as a result of this; secondly, not to use this opportunity to engage in opportunistic speculation; and thirdly, not to secretly provide materials to bandit areas. It is earnestly hoped that merchants and the public can strictly abide by the above three points. If the above three points can be achieved, then the government will naturally continue to implement the unrestricted free movement of materials in and out for a long period to benefit merchants and the public. (2) The National Commercial Control Association was formally established in Shanghai a few days ago. Its establishment aims to assist the government in improving the materials organization and completing the wartime economic system.</p>

<p>According to inquiries made by a Shanghai News Agency reporter, several months ago it was stipulated that the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce would be responsible for issuing permits for the transportation of various materials in this city. Because the National Commercial Control Association was established and centrally handled the issuance of permits for the movement of materials in and out, the City Chamber of Commerce ended the handling of the visa office and notified all trade associations! (1) Inventory registration is limited to being completed before the 23rd of this month. (2) Since the 16th of this month, it is not allowed to freely move materials. Otherwise, personnel should be sent to contact the Materials Affairs Office of the National Commercial Control Association. All associations have now separately notified their respective members to abide by this. It is heard that each has sent personnel to contact the National Commercial Control Association.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Strengthening Central Reserve Notes <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The so-called strengthening of the National Government, in terms of the economic part, is nothing more than restoring the economy under the rule of the National Government. However, the prerequisite for economic recovery is the sound development of the currency system. Because this means that the economic policy of the National Government after joining the war, the first main goal is the rectification of the currency system, specifically, it must focus on strengthening the Central Reserve Notes.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the Central Reserve Notes must be reviewed from various aspects. The first is the issue related to various currencies. Although it is said that enemy old legal tender and other miscellaneous currencies have been driven out of Central China, they are still circulating around the vicinity of the peaceful area. The close relationship between the Joint Reserve Notes and the Central Reserve Notes is, of course, very close, but from the perspective of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are still areas that need to be improved in the relationship between the two. Looking at the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and military scrip, it can be seen how close the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and the Japanese yen is. But we still have further hopes, hoping that this relationship will adapt to the current situation and have a healthy development, to become a model for the currency relationship in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>However, establishing the relationship between the Central Reserve Notes and other currencies, from the perspective of the Central Reserve Notes, still focuses on the content of the Central Reserve Notes itself. In other words, if the Central Reserve Notes want to establish a proper relationship with other currencies, it must first make real and sound currency achievements in the peaceful area itself. First, the issuance work of the Central Reserve Notes should always be made clear to people. As far as we know, the Central Reserve Notes are very sound in terms of both the amount issued and the amount of issuance reserves. The recent changes in prices are due to local reasons. If someone's trust in the Central Reserve Notes is shaken, then the factual reasons for it should be made clear to the public in order to alleviate the general public's shaken mentality. Second, regarding the whereabouts of the issued Central Reserve Notes! Should be earnestly explained. If the public knows the whereabouts of the Central Reserve Notes! It is definitely not in speculation and hoarding, but is used to strengthen the National Government and restore the economy, then? Its effect must be great.</p>
<p>The rectification of the currency system is not only a matter of the currency itself. The most important condition is to use the currency as a medium and use the soundness of commodity circulation and financial transactions to rectify the currency system. The establishment of the National Commercial Pillow System Association is a concrete manifestation of commodity circulation work. It must be remembered that the sound development of this control association is the side progress of the Central Reserve Notes. But what about in the financial sector, dare to say that this is the most unhealthy part of the economic situation in Central China, it is undeniable. The Public and Concession Industry Bureau has been working hard to reform this malpractice, and we deeply respect it, but we hope that the National Government will strengthen the past policy of suppressing speculation, and especially hope that Chinese financial figures will be more self-respecting.</p>
<p>Only by each cooperating directly and indirectly to strengthen the Central Reserve Notes from their respective positions is the responsibility of people in the peaceful camp. This is our consistent position. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Continental News on March 19)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Dreams and Realization <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>We humans possess a wonderfully mysterious power, which is the ability to dream. Everyone living in this world has their own aspiring dreams, and even if they cannot be fully realized, they still have considerable value. There is great power in dreams; they can enhance our intelligence and allow our talents and latent abilities to be fully发挥ed. With dreams, there is great hope, and with hope, there is a bright future. If we lose the power to dream, then all hope, courage, and the will to continue striving will completely vanish.</p>
<p>History tells us that the minds of the world's great figures in their childhood were filled with various strange dreams. To put it plainly, they were all dreamers, but not empty dreamers, but rather based on definite facts. The reason they were able to achieve success is that they could turn their dreams into reality. No matter how dark the environment they encountered, they could ultimately overcome all obstacles and achieve great success with unwavering faith and earnest effort. Therefore, we should exert tenacious effort to realize our great dreams.</p>
<p>Upward thoughts are sufficient to improve our dreams. To dream without realizing it becomes妄想. To construct dreams, in addition to having determined effort, we must also have firm belief; believe that the things you dream of can be realized. We must also stimulate your dreams, and never hold a skeptical attitude; doubt will weaken your courage and the will to strive. Therefore, we should dispel skeptical thoughts and embrace thoughts of accomplishment. Dreams that can be realized have value and are great. A person with dreams and faith has a far-reaching and bright future!</p>
<p>Dreamers can be said to be the pioneers of humanity, working tirelessly and enduring hardship to pave a smooth road for mankind.</p>
<p>If a person's dream is based on facts, then wonderful success is waiting for you!</p>
<h3 id="e53">Second Place Winner in the February Essay Contest - How to Read and What to Read? (Part 1) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Yuanze</p>
<p>1. How to Read?</p>
<p>A Brief Word</p>
<p>The opening sentence: Reading is both a bitter thing and a joyful thing. Why is it a "bitter thing"? Because without understanding the method of reading, one often achieves half the result with twice the effort, working hard to no avail, which makes people feel painful. Why is it a "joyful thing"? Because understanding the method of reading, one can often have a clear plan in mind and proceed according to plan, reaping the greatest effect in a short period. The so-called "bitterness" and "joy" depend entirely on whether the application of reading methods is appropriate. Therefore, the question of "how to read" is worthy of deep thought for every scholar.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of "how to read," there are many complexities and a wide range. In the hands of experts, it can simply be written into a voluminous work. The author is unlearned and lacks parental feelings and experience. I can only compile the following items based on what I have read in the past to correct domestic Mingda scholars.</p>
<p>Two Kinds of Reading Methods</p>
<p>There are many methods of reading, but comparatively, the most practical and the most extensive are two kinds: one is the method of seeking refinement, and the other is the method of seeking breadth. Both of these methods are needed in the process of seeking knowledge in life, and neither can be neglected. Focusing only on refinement without discussing breadth will inevitably lead to ignorance and limited knowledge, inevitably leading to the ridicule of being a "bookworm." Conversely, focusing only on breadth without discussing refinement will inevitably lead to insatiable greed and a lack of thorough understanding, reading as if not reading at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, the compromise is to emphasize both "refinement" and "breadth," and neither can be neglected. Originally, there were some books of specialized nature, whose writing style was extremely elegant and whose content was quite profound. Readers should concentrate and read them carefully and thoroughly, understanding the essence of the original book between the lines to尊determine the foundation of personal profound knowledge. As for general knowledge books, their types are numerous and countless. If readers want to read them carefully and thoroughly, it is impossible even with a lifetime of energy. The only method is to browse through each book, observing its general outline. In other words, adapt to the times and conditions, use the "refined reading method" for a small part of specialized books, and use the "browsing method" for the majority of common sense books.</p>
<p>Who First, Who Later</p>
<p>As for how to refer to and use each other? Or who comes first and who comes later? That varies depending on the nature of the reader. In short, students whose academic foundation is not solid should pay more attention to the refined reading method and use the browsing method less. Those who already have a considerable foundation in a certain field of study but have not yet reached the level of breadth should change their strategy and put more effort into browsing. In short, the method is tailored to the individual, and there are no strict boundaries.</p>
<p>How to Seek Refinement</p>
<p>The starting point for "refined reading" is—what books to choose? Once the books have been selected, one should arrange them in order of priority and proceed step by step. One should also persist in this, and not read other books before finishing one book. One must know that being fickle is the fierce enemy of the refined reading method, and readers should remember it. When reading, one must carefully savor the essence of the book, striving for a thorough understanding without any doubt. If one finds any points that can be doubted, one should maintain a critical attitude and explore them in various ways to seek progress in thought. The next method is to underline the important parts of the book to identify or pay attention to them; one can also write "marginal notes" on the edge of the book pages, stating one's own feelings or summarizing the main idea of the paragraph, for easy reference. The best thing to do is to write notes separately in a notebook, recording the main idea of a chapter or section of a certain book, or its highlights, for comparison and research with other reference materials; it would be even more valuable if one could record one's own feelings or opinions on the research topic.</p>

<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>Except for Xue Fengchun talking quietly to He Yougong, everyone else was silent.</p>
<p>Soon, the entire deed was written, and Yu Du asked the second hand to hold it up, reading aloud, from "Li 　Qiren Wang Genming..." all the way to. Republic of China Twenty-seventh Year, January × Day』's 'Li 　Qiren Wang Genming "and" seeing Zhong Yang Zijie, Baochang Lu Bodong, copyist Yu Duzhou".</p>
<p>Everyone listened and had no objections. Yu Duzhou put the deed on the table and asked everyone to sign it.</p>
<p>Huang Chong'an walked down from the Kang bed and slowly exited the study door. Everyone seemed to understand what he was doing, and no one asked him.</p>
<p>Genming walked over, bent down, pressed the paper with his left hand, and took the pen given to him by Yu Duzhou with his right hand. According to the location specified by Yu Duzhou, he put the tip of the pen down. The tip of the pen shook uncertainly, just like a weeping willow in the wind, blown up and down, forward and backward. With great effort, he wrote two strokes on the paper, one straight and one horizontal, intersecting, also like a weeping willow using the force of the wind to draw two marks on the floating mud by the river.</p>
<p>It took another effort when it was Lu Bodong's turn to 　the word. It turned out that he was asleep, not knowing when he was leaning halfway against the window sill and halfway against the account table, asleep. After several calls and probes, he woke up, and after a few decisive urging and coercion, he drew a familiar "fancy word" under his name with sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>After everyone's words were drawn well, Huang Chong'an also returned and put a paper package on the table. Yang Zijie opened it and grabbed those pieces, some slightly spotted, horizontally stacked 　of silver dollars, counting them one by one to sixty-seven. (Sixteen)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund - Second Committee Meeting - Report on Work, Distribute Donations <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Given the importance of the duties of elementary school teachers, the arduousness of their mission, the meagerness of their treatment, and the hardship of their lives, the colleagues of this newspaper, once they are afflicted with illness, have no way to raise funds for medical expenses, and their moaning and painful emotions are self-evident. Therefore, the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund" was established, aiming to stimulate human sympathy and provide practical assistance to the majority of poor teachers. Since February, the enthusiastic support of doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical factories has been warmly welcomed, "those with money contribute money, those with wisdom contribute wisdom," and the broad sympathy of people from all walks of life has been deeply admired.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the second committee meeting was held at the Concorse Hotel. Zhang Yipeng, Ding Fubao, Wang Yijing, Chen Binhe, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing and other gentlemen were present. Huang Jingwan reported on the progress of the handling. Public and private hospitals that voluntarily sent letters to participate included dental, ophthalmology, pediatrics, obstetrics, etc., which responded one after another to the righteous act or generously provided free diagnosis and treatment or half-price preferential treatment, totaling twenty-one. There were thirteen male and female doctors, and one each from the Health Association and Fitness Academy. Up to March 15, a total of 44,038 yuan was received from various circles, and donated medicines worth more than 11,000 yuan were received from three companies. Three hundred registration forms were issued, introducing more than thirty people to various hospitals for free treatment (including two births). More than ten health survey forms were received, and it was found that many schools suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia, gastrointestinal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis, qi deficiency, blood deficiency, colds, and coughs, which shows the seriousness of the poverty and illness of general teachers. The following resolutions were passed (1) The Concorse Hospital, Hongren Hospital, West Gate Women and Children Hospital, and Civilian Women and Children Hospital specially agreed upon at the previous meeting will each be allocated 10,000 yuan, and medicines will each be subsidized with 2,500 yuan, but they must be reported quarterly and replenished after use, and treatment must not be stopped. (2) Other assisting hospitals and doctors will be compensated for a portion of the medicine and material costs at the discretion of this newspaper based on the number of people taught. (3) Those whose families are still relatively well-off and those with bad habits are not allowed to apply. Those suffering from serious illnesses and lung diseases that require long-term recuperation as certified by a doctor are temporarily not within the scope of relief. (4) Regularly hold seminars and health checkups to study disease prevention, and invite experts to guide non-medicinal treatment and simple health methods. (5) Those who apply for medical treatment must have a teacher's ID card and a certificate from the current principal and follow the application procedures to be valid. Those who want to go to nearby hospitals for diagnosis and treatment must have proof from this newspaper. Registration forms can be requested by letter at any time.</p>
