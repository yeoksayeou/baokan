<h3 id="c1">實踐戰時生活 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們參戰快已三個月了，這三個月來，政府方面屢次昭示參戰的方針，和人民對於戰時應有的貢獻；並特派大員，馳往各大都市，官揚參戰意義，盼望人民實踐戰時生活，對於宣傳方面，確已盡了一番的努力。可是我們反省一下，大部份國民的日常生活，有多少戰時情緒？社會動態，又表現了多少戰時情緒？很可感喟的，依照目前的事實，小但說不上「戰時情緒」，大部份人的生活態度，比較平時更其放浪和奢侈了。就上海一地而言，參戰以後，一般跳舞塲，賭博塲，娛樂塲，酒菜館等等，所謂燈紅酒綠的銷金之窟，如果一看他們的營業紀錄，必定會超過戰前的數目。這種現象，誰會相信他們的國家正在與盟邦協力而對敵作戰呢？</p>
<p>世界上任何國家，一旦對外有戰事，莫不一變生活態度，此固在政府節制有方，人民尤須絕對服從，即敵國英美，向以物質享受自豪者，其戰時生活，已有急劇改變。例如美國各地，自去年十月九日起，每逢星期二不食肉，尤其紐的每週必須有二次不食肉，英國各種食物，均實行憑證分配，數量一减再减，最大的飯店，每餐不得超過五先令。前年十月以後，每人每月分配鷄蛋僅二三個。其他如蘇聯，食物的供應，較之戰前相差更遠。至於德義兩國，及盟邦日本的國民生活，更加刻苦忍受，反觀我們同樣過戰時生活，而有如此的區別，能無愧怍？</p>
<p>「戰時情緒，應在日常生活中表現，」今天我們再特別提出警醒一部份同胞，一方面盼望各級政府當局，重視這個現實，僅僅領導高呼口號，發佈標語，對於參戰是南轅北轍，無濟於事的。</p>
<p>爲了從速促成實踐戰時生活，我們盼望上海市政當局以及租界當局迅籌督促方策，這裏貢獻一些可以做到而必須做到的意見：</p>
<p>（一）竭力减少宴會酬酢，如有必要，則節的質量，宴席中廢除貴族化的魚翅，每席餐費不超過三四百元爲度，而額外之烟酒消耗，最好取消，否則亦應不超過餐費的三分之一。</p>
<p>（二）戲劇，電影，在正當娛樂立塲，雖不可缺，但應予大衆享受，不專供一部分有產有閒階級欣賞，故票價應大衆化，盡量减低，目前其劇塲門票高至三十元，太失大衆化意義。跳舞塲與賭博塲，不在正當娛樂範圍內，應絕對取締。</p>
<p>（三）高貴之化妝品，奢侈品，及貴重衣料等，應加課重稅。</p>
<p>如上所舉，不過就一時觀感所及，當然應加整飭之處尙多，我們這種主張，深信每一個戰時國民，都應該同情的。對於這種行業有關係者，雖一時有失去憑藉，或受失業的痛苦，希望當局和社會各界予以救濟。一方面當瞭解戰時生活之意義，另謀別的出路。</p>
<p>總而言之，戰時國家，而無戰時情緒，這是政府和人民應共引爲可恥的事；毫無戰時情緒，而高言參戰，是自欺欺人更爲可恥的事。進一步言，我們後方過這樣放浪奢侈的生活，怎樣對得起前綫作戰的盟邦士兵，以及大多數受物價高漲生活壓迫的同胞呢？</p>
<h3 id="c2">歡迎日本文化使節過滬 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>此次中日文化協會在京舉行全國代表大會，日本特派文化使節團蒞臨參加，我們曾撰文致敬，並表示摯誠之期待。現在使節團諸君，過滬返國，我們乘此機緣、除表示熱烈歡迎外，謹冉披陳所見如次：</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭爆發以後，使中日關係開始急激的轉變，特別是從今年新春以來，日本開始對華新政策的實踐，使中國人民開始改變其對日本的感想。而數十年來陷於隔閡分離的中日文化界，也開始親切地握手的新時期，在雙方中閒，已經閃耀起共同信念的光輝。我們深信，無論是不遠千里而來的使節團諸君，或楚我們中國歡迎者的行列，都會深深地感到衷心的欣快，和中日文化前途的光明的。</p>
<p>不過，無庸俗否認的是，由於五十年來中日兩國政治關係的演變，和雙方理　的懸隔，再加上英美資本主義文化的從中作祟，不僅民間的心理還保留着使人遺憾痕跡，即是雙方知識份子的不相了解之處，也沒有完全泯除一淨。吉田東祐先生說得對：萬一日本敗北，那麼這不單是日本的敗北，而是亞洲全體的敗北，這　道理，中國知識份子在民族革命中　其艱苦的反帝國主義　爭之際，是深深知道的。然而他們現在不但不能和日本積極協力，而且一部份反而直接與日本爲戰。現在已經自覺着的中國知識階級，都爲了這個進退兩難的處境而煩惱着。日本在政策轉變以後之新的對華文化政策，非先解決中國知識階級的這種煩惱而毅然給與他們所　求的思想路綫不可。」（申報月刊復刋第三號）我們認爲，吉田先生所希望的，輿其謂爲日本當局的責任，無寗說是日本文化界的努力來得更有效力。中國知識階級和他們背後的成千成萬的人民，今日所留意的決不是東亞共榮圈的理論，而是注視着日本理解不理解中國的民族獨立解放的精神，和這稱理解的誠意與實踐的程度。誠如吉田先生所說：「不只是口頭的誠心誠意，而是由着實踐，對於中國知識階級顯示日本是的確了解其民族的獨立精神的。除此以外，沒有別的使中國知識階級，進而使中國民衆首肯的良策。」我們希望使節團諸君在我國的時候，更多多獲得一些中國民間知識份干和靑年們對於中日文化的意見，了解其心底的蘊結，然後帶回日本，以爲今日中日文化合作的依據。我們深信，只有如此，才能眞正促進中日文化和發揚東亞文化，而奠定中日兩大民族永遠合作的基礎。</p>
<p>同時，我們希望上海的文化界，在熱烈歡送使節團諸君的時候，除了宴會酬酢親切話舊之外，多多申述一些中國文化和文化界的目前眞相及其迫切的要求，多多提供一般　衆的意旨，多多建議關於日本文化界今後對華文化工作的意見。我們在此非常時代，只有大家披瀝摯誠，而且不怕面對現實，虛心而懇切地互相協力，才能解決當前一切問題，而眞正有助於中日文化交流與東亞文化的發揚光大。上海是中國文化閉中心，我們希望日本文化使節團諸君多留幾天，使諸君中國之行，獲得更豐富的資料，也使中日兩大民族文化的前途，獲得更美滿的成就。</p>

<p>問、博士一行預定何時返國、答、預定明日去滬、稍事逗留即乘機搭輪返日、</p>
<p>問、來南京是否初次感想如何、答、余來京已三次、惟事變後尙屬初次、個人的感想很多、事變前來京眼所觸者、多爲古蹟、一如去羅馬時代、如明孝陵鷄鳴寺隨園等處、祇供憑弔而已、此次則逈異既往、頗有淸新之氣、各種建設、亦象徵新中國之未來、此點恰如義大利墨索里尼首相登台前後之相殊情形、余不勝爲中國前途賀、</p>
<p>問、聞博士有中日兩國是同種同洲同文同道」之語、可否一釋其詳、</p>
<p>答、余不欲多言、願以二三成語成例喻之、西洋人曾有成語、謂血是比水濃厚、中日同種關係如此、至於地理上兩國一衣帶水、脣亡齒寒、中日同洲關係如此、日本古代並無文字、千字文傳至日本後、始有國字後、改爲假名此即同文之關係、不加解釋、可知其密切、至於同道、中日同爲以農立國之國家、家族制度發達後、日本即有「有道而無敎何以謂之道」之語、中國古書傳到日本最早者、爲論語、孔敎因亦流傳全國、孔敎對日本國體、有育成關係、此孔敎亦即中國固有文化、不過結果是日本成爲孔子理想之國家而已、汪主席曾謂一純正三民主義、即是中國固有文化余深以爲是三民主義、不僅通於王道、也可以通於治國平天下之道、此外例子很多、即此一端、均足證明兩國同道、同爲孔子門人、亦即汪主席所云「東亞同胞東亞同志」之意、</p>
<p>問、今日適爲祀孔日博士、有何感想、</p>
<p>答、余曾參拜曲阜十三次、並會見孔德成先生、余現仍負有管理湯島聖堂之責、此次來華、原定今日去滬、因係孔子祭日、故改期明日、所感如何可想而知、問、博士此次逗留南京達一週以上、所感到滿足者爲何、有何感想請見示、</p>
<p>答、余爲文人、且硏究文藝、文人須有熱與誠、余之一言一字、均出至誠、就余觀察、此次感到滿足者、厥爲一般靑年人已多數覺悟兩國協力之程度、亦已入同生共死打倒共同敵人、不僅須用武力、且須振興文化、此次開會之際、均能赤誠相對、至堪欣慰、此外余所感者、汪主席日理萬機、勤勞政務、尤足感人、惟一般負有輔佐責任之人、予甚願能再見、較今日更爲努力之努力、蓋建國興亞之大業、非各自努力、共同協力不爲功、</p>
<p>問、對現地日本人七有何希望、答、余以爲現地日人接　貴國人士機會甚多、尤應多加硏究、適應地方風俗、此亦親善之道、富有優越感之日人、尤宜自愛、問、聞博士一家數代研究漢學、對國詩尤有心得、此次來華、必有佳作可否見示一二、</p>
<p>答、可以尊憶舊岁在主席訪問東京時、予曾在帝國飯店賦詩進呈、內有、「同種同文尋舊誼共生共死締新盟」句、當日竟至酒醉、此次來京、作品有三首一首已於大陸新報發表外、二首一於在主席招宴時賦呈、一則今日參列祭孔所作、（原詩見後）（一）汪主席招宴賦呈、「重逢話舊對芳尊、覆雨翻雲伺足論、非有藺廉交頸誼、共生同死是空言、」（二）癸未淸明節列祀孔典儀有感賦呈汪主席、「堪嘆世局亂紛紛、東亞和平偏賴君、本是孔門同學士、善鄰長計在斯文、」</p>

<p>（緬甸孫布剌巴莫城特電廿八日山本特派員發）　日軍於三月十一日夜占據緬印北部國境要街孫布刺巴莫，該地位於密芝那之北百卅五英哩，爲沿伊拉瓦底河主流之波河點。叢林密佈，野獸嘯聚，山之背，卡京人部落在焉。巴莫者卽土語「山」之義。自山頂至山腹，竹葺之土人家屋，疏落點綴於其間，山頂，並建有歐化平房，供英人狩獵及旅行時應用。此次敵人蠢動時，英美指揮官在此地由印度方面用空中運輸以補給糧秣，爲最前綫之根據地。該地之失陷，完全阻斷與雲南渝軍聯絡之企圖，與英渝二軍以極大影響。</p>
<p>（同地廿九日山本特派員發）　日軍精銳，擊滅蠢動於緬印北部國境叢林地帶之英軍後，終於十一日夜完全佔領孫布刺巴莫，遮斷敵所企圖之渝英軍聯絡路綫，一畢粉碎反攻緬甸之幻夢。各部隊將士沿伊拉　底河，在叢林密佈地帶，於敵機襲擊下，登山越險，苦戰一月有半，其勞苦殊非筆墨所能狀其萬一。</p>
<p>此次進擊，歷時一月半，行動衹限於夜間，爲避免日閭敵戰鬥機之窺伺，自朝靄初晴迄暮色蒼茫之間，隱身叢林，以畫作夜，暫告假睡。白暮，始開始行動。一日三餐，亦僅限於晚九時，深晚二時，及晨八時—在緬甸此時天尚未明。因此將士，終因習慣而皆具如狸貓梟鷹之夜目。沿伊拉瓦底河畔闊僅一公尺之斷崖殘道，開始進擊時，僅用手在暗中摸索，載重車馬，時虞墜落。</p>
<p>虎豹等獸類之吼叫，爲不時可聞之伴奏曲。而本隊夜間進擊之得以易於行軍者，實出於挺進斥候之先遣作隊業之勞苦所賜。</p>
<p>此先邊隊與深山之緬甸土人間持山刀，於從林泥徑中斬荊披　，架橋修路。地雷遍地密佈，偶一不愼而踐踏，即轟然爆發。間有絆擊徒步；載重車馬之繫信式信管地雷，隨地皆有，防不勝防。剷除此等障礙物者，亦係作業隊之苦心。用木製滾路機。模陳爲一列，用牛曳之而行，此牛部隊爲去除地雷之妙法。有時此先遺作業隊之工作又截然大變，普通在乾季雨往往點滴不見，但至緬甸北部，在朝晨濃霧之後，繼以驟雨，這路頓成泥濘。地雷爆發之處，開一大隙穴，任用多少泥土塡埋，終難立即舖平。祗能於從林中伐木代石，以塡埋此隙穴，使車馬得以通行。</p>
<p>叢林戰鬥中最感煩苦者，上有山蛭，下有山蝨之潛擊。山蛭小如仁丹粒，往往於不知不覺間潛入，吸食血液，雖不覺痛癢，但被囓之處，顯如小指大之一塊紅腫。山蝨小如奧蟲，可於手足，如蜂刺然，甚爲疼痛。</p>
<p>越密芝那百英哩，自伊拉瓦底河至庫蒙山脈之麓，　秣之補給極爲困難，除庭粥之外，僅賴蕃瓜樹及香蕉樹幹之蕊以充飢。然將士均甘之如前，艱苦行軍，進迫北部　印國境聯結雲南印度之連絡路，粉碎渝英軍之野心，完全佔領其重要遽點孫布刺巴莫，小久部隊以下各部隊之偉績，在大東亞戰史上永占光榮之一頁。</p>

<p>第二次特別攻擊隊壯烈的偉績，已由海軍省正式公佈，全體國民均不勝感奮。河相達夫，爲當時日本駐澳洲公使，曾由交換船護送奇襲雪梨四勇十的遺骨回國。在該事件公佈時，以談話投寄讀賣報知社。</p>
<p>——前駐澳洲公使河相達夫</p>
<p>自開戰至去夏乘交換船回國，經過八個月的期間，我被軟禁於墨爾缽恩的公使官邸。此期間，公使館職員二十人，不許越雷池一步。初因澳洲政府禁止報紙送達，故外間情况，不得而知。後經交涉，始獲允許。於是在去年六月一日報紙上，我們突然被一段記事所駭倒。報上說：</p>
<p>五月三十一日，日本小型潛航艇潛人雪梨灣口，向我海軍所屬的一兵艦發射水雷，當被擊沉。</p>
<p>這是眞的嗎？我們屏着息，神經感覺到麻痺了，緊緊地握住報紙，熱淚簌簌地落下。在那個時候，在那種塲所，誰能够想像到，日本海軍勇士，竟會潛入更在蘇羅門羣島之南的敵都的咽喉！這無敵的日本海軍魂的突擊，震動了澳洲七百萬人民，與其三百萬平方哩的全部國土，全國鼎沸那種驚愕的景況，均爲我听親身目覩者。</p>
<p>澳洲海軍葬禮</p>
<p>經過五六天之後，澳洲政廳經由日本利益代管國瑞士的總領事來通知我說：</p>
<p>「戰死的日本軍人四名，要用海軍禮歸葬，然後冉加火葬。」</p>
<p>我當即允諾。又說：</p>
<p>「當舉行葬儀的時候，鑒於目前日澳二國的關係，日本公使不能參加，但可以贈以花圈。」</p>
<h3 id="c24">奇襲雪梨緬懷錄　第二次特別攻擊隊潛艇施威 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>我一切聽任瑞士總領事料理。四勇士的葬儀舉行於六月九日，以雪梨鎭守府長官繆阿海特•古爾特少將爲主祭，瑞士總領事代表日本參加，極爲嚴肅，事後瑞士總領事很淸楚地告訴我當時的情形。</p>
<p>四勇士的遣骸，覆以太陽旗，置入四具柩中，由水兵抬赴葬塲。水兵一隊，拖槍垂首肅然整列送殯。高鳴弔砲三發之後，在軍樂吹奏聲中，把遺骸施行火葬。</p>
<p>直至八月十三日，交換　將要出發的時候，始把安置於雪梨市內敎堂中四勇士的遺骨交付於我。公使館的館員，粗陋的製就了四個神龕，敬謹地安置英靈，在官邸的庭中，摧折芳香的楠木一枝以代楊桐。一切均在忽促間辦就，聊表心意而已。這時候的景况！永刻在我們的心板上，終生不忘。</p>
<p>勇士們的家族</p>
<p>從墨爾缽恩至羅倫索·瑪爾開斯的交換船中，因爲極擁擠，所以連安置英靈的塲所也沒有，在四星期的航海時間中，把四座英靈安置於我的房中，朝夕瞻仰，緬懷四勇士的偉烈，輒不勝悽愴神往，　倉丸抵達橫濱的時候，我又會見了勇士們的遺族。都竹正雄兵曹長的雙親，頭一句就問我：</p>
<p>「所帶去的子彈都發射完嗎？」</p>
<p>這雙親的愛媳，見到正雄兵曹長的遺骸之後，並不痛悼，恐怕她自尋短見，追尋丈夫於地下，於是遠遠的從鄉間趕到愛媳的寓所，問她說：「在這次戰爭中，你是否一定要死呢？她答說：「是的，早晚終要死的。」「那麼，你的母親將停止再給你說親的念頭了。」二人抱着失掉了丈夫的子媳，睡了一晚。</p>
<p>「忠勇」感動敵國</p>
<p>大森猛特務少尉的兄長二人說：</p>
<p>「猛是我們的幼弟，他在二歲的時候母親就亡故了，由繼母撫養，父親在野良任事的時候，也把他帶在身邊，漸漸長大成人。我們弟兄們在一起的時候，大家都說要孝順父親，現在猛是最孝的人了。」</p>
<p>我在接觸了故勇士親族的這種姿態和言詞，明白了澳國政府舉行海軍葬的理由，原來他們忠勇殉國的偉績，深深地打動了每個人的心裏。有其父斯有其子，有其兄斯有其弟。這日本的父，母，產生了奇襲眞珠灣的軍神，又產生了台愛果，斯華萊斯，悉尼特別攻擊隊的勇士。</p>
<p>敵軍長官讚歡</p>
<p>在南十字星下，遠征重洋，以馬革裏屍爲志，以求貫徹祖國的意志，這四勇士的烈魂，衝動了全澳人民的心胸。他們將研究有色人種日本何以强的緣故。自認爲美國第四十九州的澳洲，對此四勇士葬以海軍禮。雪梨鎭守府長官古爾特少將更在播聲中稱：</p>
<p>「日本將士乘鐵的柩前來襲擊。他們一點也不懷生還之望。澳洲能有幾人具有這些勇士們千份之一的殉國勇氣呢？</p>
<p>至誠通天</p>
<p>至誠可以通天，四勇士默然無言，盡其職責的行爲，並也感動了言語不通的澳洲敵人了。中國的先哲說：</p>
<p>孰仁立志　先行後言</p>
<p>千里之外　皆爲兄弟</p>
<p>善於長辭廣辯的唐代人，即已謳頌無言的行爲。本來，日本可以說是不重言辭的國家。這特別攻擊隊勇士們的挺身成仁，即爲日本人五尺之軀的具體的表現。當追懷這崇高的英魂時候，不徒然用言辭，而以實行來紀念他們的人，決不在少，豈僅我一人而已。（翔：譯自三月二十八日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<p>趁國府還都三週年紀念盛典的機會，在南京舉行了一個全　文化代表大會，日本也　派文化使節大串兎代夫（國民精神文化研究所員），齋藤响（日本大學敎授），佐藤武夫（早稻田犬學敎授）三氏來參加這個盛會，大會　已閉幕。五日傍晚，一行由南京來滬，下榻百老滙大廈，各使節發表談話如左</p>
<p>健康的住宅　佐藤武夫氏談</p>
<p>這次到南京已經是第二次了，第一次去是在昭和十四年（民二十八年），和這一次去所得的印象，大不相同了。小別三年，進步得出　意外，所給我的感覺，就是南京除了歷史上政治上的條件之外，更具備着一切的優越條件，一望而知是國都的氣槪。天然的形勢，不是偶然的，長江紫金山玄武湖之類都是天賦的龍盤虎踞的形勢。做新中國的首都，最適當也沒有了它不像上海這樣的呆板，也有人把都市計劃認爲無聊，可以我以爲不然，中國自有其構成中國的傳統，我們必須認識這種傳統，從前　政權也曾實施過都市計劃，可是醉心歐化的地方太多。要把中國的地方都市化，先得要分淸中國的獨特傳統，再從新出發，這一點是値得充分硏究的。再看到日僑的住宅問題，也須要努力解決，要求日僑的發展，必須要有健康的住宅，可是因爲資林不能獲得，所以遷延不決，住宅困難，祇有趨向嚴重的一途，日本內地住宅問題，已經發明住宅營團，生產戰十的住宅，先吿解決，在華也得要關心道點才是。據聞關係方面正在極力促進建設健康的日本住宅。</p>
<p>文化活用問題　齋藤晌氏談</p>
<p>新中國在文化上還不够積極，如何來活用文化是個問題。就實際上說，文化交流這件工作，唯有新文化的創　，才能窺具原理，我們明瞭中國文化的現狀，回到日本內地之後，準備積極協商中日交流工作，要把最前進的文化團體拿到這裏來，利用站在世界觀上的　高文化，來得中日　　的眞正成績。最後有一　　爲欣喜的，　是　　到中國來，與華方文化人披瀝暢談，收獲　多。</p>
<p>完成戰爭一員　大串兎代夫氏談</p>
<p>這次我們來出席中日文化協會主辦的全國文化代表大會，中日兩國的文化人能够聚　一堂，它的意義良深。日本也有學術，藝衛，　育，敎育界代表十餘名列席參加，　　種種，在中日文化交流上，是一個劃時代的壯舉。過去雖有文化　　，但都僅注重出版　等類的翻譯和派遣留學生，所以　　的文化交流，談不到充分密切。但是中國事變的發生，繼之大東亞戰爭突發，一部份人高呼中日文化工作，從事實踐，我們把這種現象叫做「文化人的發見」，這個時候，我們必須團結兩國的文化界，來促進文化交流。</p>
<p>這次到中國來，和華方文化關係人士促膝懇談，我歸國之後，當將這裏所得的敎益爲基礎，在文化崗位上努力，以文化的力暈來做其成爲完逐大東亞戰爭的一員。（雲鵬：譯自四月六日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 徐叔範</p>
<p>靑年求學之時，最易傳染肺病，優秀學生學業未成而死於此疾者甚衆，此於國家民族，影響至鉅，故非亟謀防治不可。試述「全市學生X光檢查」之建議數則於下：</p>
<p>（一）此舉應由敎育及衛生當局負責嚴格施行，檢查範圍暫以高中及大學程度之學生爲限。</p>
<p>（二）全市之肺癆科醫生，醫院，衛生機關及各處之X光機應律參加，義務或免費供給應用，由負責當局統盤支配，各校學生按照指定日期前往指定地點受騐。凡及格者憑檢騐證書得往原校繼續求學，否則應令停學受治。</p>
<p>（三）發現已有肺病之學生，如病狀已深，應即開始適當之治療（如人工氣胸衛等），病輕者先住院或居家休養三月或半年，再酌量情形治療之。病人應　從醫師之指示處置，不得擅自作主。</p>
<p>（四）另請熱心之醫師數位，指導治療及休養中之病人，使處於最有利之生活情形，藉促病軀之加速復原，並防免病人受不正當醫藥之誘惑欺騙，而有誤入歧途之危險。</p>
<p>（五）貧寒學生之洽療費用，應由公家担負之，或由各界捐款補助之，得有助學金或獎學金（如申報讀者助學金）之患病學生，應請原資助機關繼續核發其醫藥費。</p>
<p>（六）檢查須每年或每學期舉行一次，以防肺癆症之隨時侵襲。在可能時，學校中全體敎職員亦須受同樣檢騐。</p>
<p>在此建議辦法尙未實施之前，務望各校學生（及各界人士）自動前往本屆防癆運　指定之醫院，受免費之X光肺部檢查。如自覺已有肺癆嫌疑之症狀，如消瘦，倦怠，咳嗽多痰，神經衰弱等，尤忌諱疾戒醫，以免因循誤事。須知肺癆一症在目前治療已無問題，惟須早期求治，病情愈淺，所需治療時期愈短，治療費用亦愈省。而隱忍遷延，必招不幸之後果，蓋吾人一經結核菌之侵入後，病體設無適當之休養，則病情必漸漸加深，絕無倖免之理，幸一般自恃體强與抵抗力者有以鑒之。</p>

<h3 id="c46">言　米價與一般物價 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>近滬市米價大跌了，其他農產品如雞蛋茶葉之類亦隨之下跌若干，至於工業品，除肥皂香烟等外，可說是不特不隨米價下跌，而且反有樅續上漲之勢。諺云：「笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自爲之，」目下工業日用品　囤積商版亦大有「笑駡由他笑駡，漲價我自爲之」或「米價由他大跌，工業品　自續漲」的不可一世的氣概。</p>
<p>「民以食爲天」，所以近年來經濟　者間頗有主張米價爲一般物價之標準者，他們以爲「米價一漲則百物皆漲，米價一跌則百物皆跌。」此說在米價上漲的時候亦頗爲一般商人所服膺，故米價一漲，他們的售品標價，無不隨之提高。然向現在米價大跌了，他們對於此說，則棄之若敝屣，而移轉於供求律的新陣地，說　工業日用品的原料缺乏，出品不旺，需求不斷，所以按諸求過於供則價漲的原則而漲價，實爲勢所必然。</p>
<p>商人重利輕義輕別離，古今同慨：欲求漲價，何患無辭，學者理論，徒爲其圖利發財之藉口。記者讀史，嘗疑古之執政者爲何每每採取重農輕商政策，今則恍然大悟了！</p>
<p>平心而論，人類一切禍水皆起源於一貪字：商人重利，不過貪之尤甚者，然而福兮禍所伏，亦即利兮害所伏。願商大及一般囤戶之讀報紙評言者，能够自重自反，不再趁火打刦，害人自害，世局推移，原無定律：今日貨重幣輕，安知不久的將來沒有幣重貨輕之一日？今日不可一世的暴發戶，安知不是他日焦頭爛額的破落戶？</p>

<p>中國參戰後關於物資交流之機構積極整頓現已有全國商業統制總會之設立，故國內之交易得以統制，實施經濟審談會，並已於本月一日召開第一屆會議，以決定基本方策，華中方面經各財界鉅了熱心合作，國府並任命賢能之士爲經濟顧問，其統制辦法自可逐漸圓滑。</p>
<p>物價問題</p>
<p>關於物價問題，目前在華北華中均已成爲嚴重問題，關於此點，余認爲必須實施有效對策，華中方面米價前曾漲至一千七百餘元，最近因物資搬出入限制之撤廢等措置，已降至七百元左右，雞蛋亦落半價，其餘青菜亦均跌價，此後爲生活必需品之自給自足，須振興各地工業云云。</p>

<h3 id="c54">對於全國商業統制總會之觀感（一） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 兼言</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會，旣已於本月十五日成立，是歷年由友邦主持之物資統制，亦即於時起，正式移交於商業統制總會，足徵友邦當局，實具有與我方民間　　界合作之決心。尤堪慶幸者，此次商統會之負責人員，多爲　融與實業界知名之士，故將來必能做到調脅劑　，安定民生的目的。茲以第三者立塲，根據平日與工商界接觸之經騐，對於商業統制總會略貢意見如左：</p>
<p>（一）查緝工作的重要：按統制經濟，貴在澈底施行，然欲澈底施行，非　嚴密之查緝組織不可。藎照查緝不嚴密，施行即不能澈底，施行不能澈底，則黑市，黑黑市等，即隨時可以發生，而統制之本意即將完全失去。今試以海關爲例。過去海關稅收，所以能較厘金以及其他各種稅收爲高者，固由於其稅率之單簡與辦法之妥善等優點所致，然尤歸功於其外勤與緝私工作之認眞。故其稅率雖逐年增高，（有時達從價百分之百以上）但其稅收仍能源源上增，足證其查緝工作之有效。過去物資統制，所以未能十分圓滿者，其因固多，然查緝之未能週密，實爲主因之一。按查緝工作所以未能週密者，由於其無直屬之機構所致，即以經濟警察之組織而言，亦至最近始有端倪，但尙未能充分發揮其效率。商業統制總會旣吿成立，但對於查緝工作，並無專門組織，故在目前，亦惟有軍警仰　軍警機關之協助而已。</p>

<h3 id="c55">可記的舊事 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 柳雨生</p>
<p>最近日本有許多位文化界負盛名的人遠　到中國來，其中多爲我們所熟知，特別是文學方面幾位。這篇小文裏所談及的，只有武者小路實篤先生和河上徹太郞先生，蓋衹就小佞個人過去所嘗晤接的，略表微忱：其餘像鹽谷節山（溫）先生，雖是盡人皆知的　學家，我僅和他的快婿辛島　敎授見過，他本人還沒有見面的機會，這裏暫不多及了。</p>
<p>我所能够寫的，蓋亦祗得二三事。談到武者小路，不能不叫我們憶起日本文學界三十年以前著名的白樺派人道主義的作家。白樺雜誌創刊在日本明治四十三年（一九一〇），雜誌的中堅，除了武者小路而外，像志賀直哉，長與善郞，有島武郞……等，我們都已耳熟能詳。他們多半出身華族，深受盧騷，杜斯退益夫斯基，託爾斯泰，羅曼羅蘭這些人的影響，以愛好和平，追求理想境界的實現爲鵠的。尤其是武者小路先生的著作，在中國過去曾受過極大的重視，如魯迅先生曾譯過俄的一個靑年的夢，其他重要譯本如武者小路實篤集（商務，收樊仲雲譯桃色女郞，周作人譯一日裏的一休和尚，某婦人。）武者小路實篤戲曲集（中華，崔萬秋楊雲飛合譯，收劇本父與女，野島先生之夢，書室夫人）。徐祖正譯有四人及其他，養父兩篇劇本，王古魯譯有張男的末日，一個家庭嬰兒殺戮中的一小事三篇劇本，合編爲『四人及其他』一書。此外的單行本，有章克標譯愛慾，周白棣譯妹妹，崔萬秋譯母與子，孤獨的魂，沈宰白譯戲劇研究，毛詠裳李宗武合譯人的生活等。散見各雜誌的零篇或新著，更是舉不勝舉。從譯作的繁多這一點看來，我們覺得武者小路先生，是一個眞正能够同情中國人民和得到中國人民同情的人。</p>
<p>我和武者小路先生的晤面，是由於錢稻孫先生的介紹。他的篤實的相貌，謙和的態度，都使我回憶起二十幾年前他和他的同志們在日本日向所提倡的新村運動。新村建設的運動雖然早已停止了，但是，我料想他的素願，他的熱誠和精神，却是與時俱進，永遠向着人類最高的止於至善的境界去奮鬬的！我希望他這次身履這個艱辛亂離中的中華民國的境土，看到中口的眞實老百姓們的一股吃苦耐勞，誠樸堅實，愛好和平，有血肉，有骨氣的精神，一定可以更對我們發生更進一步的瞭解和同情。武者小路先生過去曾經到過中國，所以這裏我也不用多說。讓我借用他在「一個靑年的夢」裏的夫人翁的話來說一遍罷：『請寬恕我的無力，寬恕我的話的無力。但我心裏所有的對於美　的國的仰慕，却要請諸君　察的。』</p>
<p>河上徹先生是現代日本著名的文學評論家。過去有過一兩次報紙上的電報，把他的名字誤作河上肇。其實他們却也是有本家的關係的。他現在主編着「文學界」雜誌，是跟『文藝春秋』相像的姊妹刊物。在主張上和文學立塲上，他和菊池寬，久米芷雄，豐島與志雄，舟橋聖一等，大概是接近的。這些人除了豐島先生外，我也都談過幾次的話。我在異國心影錄（「古今」周年紀念號）拙文裏，曾說：</p>
<p>菊池先生在著作界的盛譽，從日本的大正時代一直到今天，數十年來如一日，用不着我多去稱讚。我完全不懂得日語，談話的時候完全用的英語，就算並不隔膜，至少也並不格外來得親切。菊池先生對我的態　，……是我記憶之中永遠不會忘記的。可是，我在讀完了菊池先生最近的文章之後，我忽然想起菊池先生的一篇非常有藝術　値的短篇小說來，那是他的「超　恩仇之外」。這篇故事的內容，是可以感動得叫人流淚的。這篇故事的情節，是可以讓一個陌生的中國人去了解日本國民的生活和他們的人生　學的。這篇故事的題旨，雖然是講的人與人之間的恩仇關係，可是我覺得國與國之間的關係，不論是理智的看法還是感情的衝動，也未嘗不可從這篇小說裏，悟出一番大徹大悟的道理。我所以寫出現在這篇短文，一方面是想答謝菊池先生……他們許多人待我的盛情，一方面是我覺得，菊池先生能够寫得出『超乎恩仇　　　那樣的傑作，那麼　他對於我的期望和熱忱，是能够使我發生深刻印象，引起重大的反響的。</p>
<p>在我離開日本的時候，途中住在奈良。「文學界』的主持人河上徹太郞先生從東京趕到奈良來，表示他目己和菊池先生他們的意思，希望我在日本多住些時候。我們的談話由夜間兩點多鐘釗三點半鐘，短袖跣足，穿着寬大的睡袍，同座的還有巖谷大四先生。他們的意思我是明瞭的，雖然我謝却了他們的盛意。不過，我用一句極誠懇而又極熱烈的話回答我的日本文學界的朋友們，爲了要安慰你們，我纔寫了這篇小文，雖在苦痛的寂寞中，裏面的話是沒有一個字不是出於肺腑的。</p>
<p>後來，河上先生還有過信來，叫我替他的刋物寫文章。他的信也是非常富於感情的。深願這一次他到中國來，正和我勸過林房雄先生的話一樣：多看看中國老由姓的實際生活，多去觀察中國社會的眞實情狀，這不僅是一個文學作家　盡的責仟，爲了中日兩大國家永永久的前途着想，也非如此不可。</p>

<p>「還不好，所以我歡在家裏作別的事情的時候多」。</p>
<p>「還是你學了這個手藝，像我就一樣也不會」。</p>
<p>「但是你學了這個手藝，不過能賺幾個零用錢，一些也沒有什麼大好處。……」</p>
<p>他們談談說說就再踏上幾個石級，進了山門。大殿上人很多，香烟也很濃密，幾乎使他們睜不開眼睛。他們就由殿　穿過廚房，到了一個長軒。</p>
<p>這裏的人更多，　坐着在喝茶，原來已成爲一個臨時的茶館了。南面一排窗，開在那裏，視域比了山門外還要　些。無疑，這是一個很好的茶館。</p>
<p>「喝兩開茶吧』，阿五邀着說。</p>
<p>大根不能說不，因爲照理他是應盡地主之誼，先邀阿五的。不過他素來沒有上茶館喝茶的習慣，所以他和阿五到了這裏，竟沒有想起這會事。現在阿五邀着他，只好忸怩地脫：『好的』。</p>
<p>他們揀了靠窗口僅有的兩個空位子坐了下來。喝茶的大都是泥腿的鄉下人，乘這難得的節日，在此遊散一下，娛樂一下，　嚷嚷地，都很高興。他們一坐下來，堂倌就將茶送到他們的面前，他們，尤其是阿五，就和別人一樣，放開喉嚨，高談關論起來。</p>
<p>「他媽的，到今天我才眞正做了人」！阿五爲大根滿滿地斟了一杯茶，又爲自己斟了一杯，露着鬆散得意的神氣說。（二十五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Practicing Wartime Living <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We have been at war for almost three months now. During these three months, the government has repeatedly proclaimed the principles of participation in the war and the contributions that the people should make during wartime. It has also dispatched high-ranking officials to major cities to promote the significance of participating in the war, hoping that the people will practice wartime living. In terms of propaganda, it has indeed made considerable efforts. However, if we reflect on it, how much wartime sentiment is there in the daily lives of most citizens? How much wartime sentiment is expressed in social trends? It is quite regrettable that, according to the current situation, not only can we not talk about "wartime sentiment," but the lifestyle of most people is even more dissolute and extravagant than usual. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the start of the war, the business records of dance halls, gambling houses, entertainment venues, restaurants, and other so-called dens of dissipation have undoubtedly exceeded pre-war levels. Who would believe that their country is cooperating with the Allied nations to fight the enemy given this phenomenon?</p>
<p>When any country in the world goes to war, it invariably changes its lifestyle. This is because the government has effective control, and the people must absolutely obey. Even in enemy countries like Britain and the United States, which pride themselves on material enjoyment, wartime living has undergone drastic changes. For example, in various parts of the United States, since October 9th of last year, meat has not been eaten every Tuesday. In New York, in particular, meat must not be eaten twice a week. In Britain, various foods are distributed by rationing, and the quantity is reduced again and again. In the largest hotels, each meal must not exceed five shillings. Since October of the year before last, each person has been allocated only two or three eggs per month. In the Soviet Union, the supply of food is even more different than before the war. As for the national life of Germany, Italy, and Japan, they are even more austere and enduring. Looking back at us, we are also living in wartime, but there is such a difference. Can we not be ashamed?</p>
<p>"Wartime sentiment should be expressed in daily life." Today, we once again issue a special warning to some of our compatriots. On the one hand, we hope that government authorities at all levels will pay attention to this reality. Simply leading the shouting of slogans and issuing slogans is counterproductive to participating in the war and will not help.</p>
<p>In order to speed up the implementation of wartime living, we hope that the Shanghai municipal authorities and the concession authorities will quickly plan and supervise policies. Here are some suggestions that can and must be done:</p>
<p>(1) Make every effort to reduce banquets and social events. If necessary, control the quality and quantity. Abolish the aristocratic shark fin in banquets, and limit the cost of each table to no more than three or four hundred yuan. It is best to cancel the additional consumption of tobacco and alcohol, otherwise it should not exceed one-third of the cost of the meal.</p>
<p>(2) Drama and film, while indispensable in the context of legitimate entertainment, should be enjoyed by the public, not just for the appreciation of a part of the propertied and leisurely class. Therefore, ticket prices should be popular and reduced as much as possible. Currently, the ticket price of theaters is as high as thirty yuan, which is too far from the meaning of popularization. Dance halls and gambling houses are not within the scope of legitimate entertainment and should be absolutely banned.</p>
<p>(3) High-end cosmetics, luxury goods, and precious fabrics should be subject to heavy taxes.</p>
<p>The above are just some of the observations at the moment. Of course, there are many more things that need to be rectified. We believe that every wartime citizen should sympathize with this proposal. For those involved in this type of industry, although they may temporarily lose their livelihood or suffer from unemployment, we hope that the authorities and all sectors of society will provide relief. On the one hand, they should understand the meaning of wartime living and find other ways out.</p>
<p>In short, a country at war without wartime sentiment is something that the government and the people should be ashamed of. To speak highly of participating in the war without any wartime sentiment is self-deception and even more shameful. Furthermore, how can we, in the rear, live such a dissolute and extravagant life, and be worthy of the Allied soldiers fighting on the front lines, and the vast majority of compatriots suffering from the pressure of high prices?</p>
<h3 id="e2">Welcoming the Japanese Cultural Delegation to Shanghai <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a national congress in Beijing, and Japan specially dispatched a cultural delegation to participate. We have written articles to pay tribute and express our sincere expectations. Now that the members of the delegation are passing through Shanghai on their way back to their country, we take this opportunity to express our warm welcome and offer the following views:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Sino-Japanese relations have begun to change rapidly. Especially since the beginning of this year, Japan has begun to implement a new policy toward China, which has led the Chinese people to change their feelings toward Japan. The Sino-Japanese cultural circles, which have been isolated and separated for decades, have also begun a new period of cordial handshakes, and the light of common belief has already shone between the two sides. We firmly believe that both the delegation members who have come from afar and our Chinese welcomers will deeply feel the heartfelt joy and the brightness of the future of Sino-Japanese culture.</p>
<p>However, it cannot be denied that due to the evolution of political relations between China and Japan over the past fifty years, the separation of the two sides' views, and the interference of Anglo-American capitalist culture, not only does the psychology of the people still retain regrettable traces, but the lack of understanding between intellectuals on both sides has not been completely eliminated. Mr. Toyosuke Yoshida is right: If Japan is defeated, then this is not just Japan's defeat, but the defeat of the entire Asia. This principle is deeply known to Chinese intellectuals in the arduous anti-imperialist struggle of national revolution. However, they are now not only unable to actively cooperate with Japan, but some are directly fighting against Japan. The Chinese intellectuals who are now self-conscious are troubled by this dilemma. After Japan's policy change, the new cultural policy toward China must first solve this trouble of the Chinese intellectuals and resolutely give them the ideological line they seek. (Shenbao Monthly, Reissue No. 3) We believe that what Mr. Yoshida hopes for is more effective through the efforts of the Japanese cultural circles than to say that it is the responsibility of the Japanese authorities. What the Chinese intellectuals and the millions of people behind them are paying attention to today is not the theory of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but whether Japan understands the spirit of China's national independence and liberation, and the sincerity and extent of practice of this understanding. As Mr. Yoshida said: "It is not just verbal sincerity, but showing the Chinese intellectual class that Japan truly understands its national spirit through practice. There is no other good strategy to get the Chinese intellectual class, and then the Chinese people, to nod." We hope that the members of the delegation will gain more opinions from Chinese folk intellectuals and young people on Sino-Japanese culture during their stay in our country, understand the accumulation in their hearts, and then bring them back to Japan as the basis for Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation today. We firmly believe that only in this way can we truly promote Sino-Japanese culture and promote East Asian culture, and lay the foundation for the eternal cooperation of the two great nations of China and Japan.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that the cultural circles in Shanghai, when warmly sending off the members of the delegation, will, in addition to banquets and cordial talks, state more about the current truth of Chinese culture and the cultural circles and their urgent demands, provide more of the public's will, and offer more suggestions on the future cultural work of the Japanese cultural circles in China. In this extraordinary era, only by everyone expressing their sincerity, and not being afraid to face reality, humbly and earnestly cooperating with each other, can we solve all current problems, and truly help Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and the promotion of East Asian culture. Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture. We hope that the Japanese cultural delegation members will stay for a few more days, so that the members' trip to China can obtain more abundant information, and also make the future of the culture of the two great nations of China and Japan achieve more satisfactory results.</p>

The Entourage Arrived in Fukuoka Yesterday Afternoon. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda issued a joint communiqué at 4:00 PM on April 6th as follows: Since the National Government participated in the war, we have been grateful to the friendly nation of Japan for returning the exclusive concessions in various places, the Beijing Legation Area, and abolishing restrictions on the movement of materials, etc., providing various assistance to our country to complete independence and autonomy and establish a wartime system. Li Yuan President Chen Gongbo was specially appointed as a special envoy to Japan to express his gratitude and have frank talks with the Japanese authorities on the issue of completing the war. Special Envoy Chen departed from Beijing at 10:30 this morning to Japan. The entourage includes Sun Lifu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Shen Guanzhun, Counselor of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Huang Pusheng, Counselor of the Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government, and Lin Ji, Senior Secretary of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) Those who accompanied the special envoy to Japan, Chen Gongbo, with the qualifications of Chang, include Sun Lifu, Shen Guanzhun, Huang Pusheng, and Lin Ji. The brief resumes of the four attendants are noted below: (Sun Lifu) Currently the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 41 years old this year, from Tianjin.

<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) After the National Government participated in the war, the friendly nation of Japan, in order to assist our country in completing independence and freedom, successively returned the exclusive concessions in various places, the Beijing Legation Area, and abolished extraterritoriality and restrictions on the movement of materials. Therefore, the National Government expressed its gratitude to Japan and strengthened it, and referred to the recovery and construction of Manchukuo during the war, so that the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchuria would be further strengthened and closely cooperated. A clear order was issued a few days ago appointing Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan, as a special envoy to Japan, and Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. It is learned that Special Envoy Chen flew to Japan at 10:30 a.m. on the 6th. Those who went to the scene to see him off included Ambassador Cai to Japan, Vice President, Lin Garrison Commander Deng, Director-General Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and all members of the Legislative Yuan, with enthusiastic emotions.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 6th (Central News Agency) Special Envoy to Japan Chen Gongbo and his entourage arrived here by plane at 47 minutes past noon this month.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan this time is the first time the National Government has sent an ambassador to visit a friendly country after participating in the war. Chen's trip will not only express our country's gratitude and strengthen the relationship with the friendly country, but also express our country's determination to participate in the war to the ruling and opposition parties of the friendly country. There is a close relationship between China and Japan, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has formed a situation of shared survival. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, government officials of China and Japan have visited each other many times. In May of last year, Foreign Minister Chu's visit to Japan, and in September, the three special envoys of Japan, Hiruma, Arida, and Nagai, came to China for a return visit. At the end of December, the Chairman himself visited Japan again. In February of this year, Prime Minister Tojo's visit not only increased the friendly relations between China and Japan, but also helped the progress of the current situation due to many talks. It is believed that Chen's visit to Japan this time will be even more rewarding. Not only will the relationship between China and Japan become closer and more harmonious, but the total strength of the East Asian axis will also be strengthened, which will help the completion of the Greater East Asia War. China has been participating in the war for three months, and is actively seeking the establishment of a wartime system in the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects. Japan is an advanced country and the leader of the East Asian national liberation war, and has achieved great results in this war. The various wartime organizations and institutions in the country are worthy of being learned by the backward countries in East Asia. Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan this time will enable our country to learn from the wartime system and become more complete, so as to exert the total strength of the country and make a greater contribution to the East Asian national liberation war. Therefore, Special Envoy Chen's trip has great significance.</p>

<p>Dr. Shioya Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) After the closing of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, most of the representatives from various regions have returned to their original places. The Japanese delegation, led by Chief Shioya and 14 others, is also scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 6th and then return to their country. The reporter, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese representatives are all famous professors in Japan, and most of them are authorities in the economic and cultural circles, paid a visit to Dr. Onsen Shioya, the head of the delegation, at 7:00 PM on the 5th to ask for his opinions on Sino-Japanese cultural matters. Although the doctor is in his seventies, he is energetic and has a gentle attitude. His answers to the reporter's questions were extremely sincere. The following is a summary of the questions and answers:</p>
<p>Q: When is Dr. Shioya planning to return to your country? A: I am scheduled to go to Shanghai tomorrow. After a short stay, I will take a boat back to Japan.</p>
<p>Q: Is this your first time in Nanjing? What are your impressions? A: I have been to Nanjing three times, but this is my first time after the Incident. I have many personal impressions. Before the Incident, what I saw in Nanjing were mostly historical sites, just like going to the Roman era, such as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Jiming Temple, and Sui Garden, which are only for reminiscing. This time is very different from the past. There is a fresh atmosphere. Various constructions also symbolize the future of the new China. This is just like the different situations before and after Prime Minister Mussolini came to power in Italy. I can't help but congratulate the future of China.</p>
<p>Q: I heard that Dr. Shioya has said that "China and Japan are the same race, the same continent, the same script, and the same path." Can you explain this in detail?</p>
<p>A: I don't want to say too much. I would like to use two or three idioms and precedents to illustrate. Westerners have an idiom that blood is thicker than water. The relationship between China and Japan is like this. Geographically, the two countries are as close as lips and teeth. The relationship between China and Japan is like this. In ancient times, Japan had no characters. After the Thousand Character Classic was introduced to Japan, there were national characters, which were later changed to kana. This is the relationship of the same script. No explanation is needed to know how close it is. As for the same path, China and Japan are both countries that are established on agriculture. After the family system developed, Japan had the saying "If there is a way but no teaching, what is the way?" The earliest Chinese book to be introduced to Japan was the Analects. Confucianism also spread throughout the country. Confucianism has a nurturing relationship with the Japanese national essence. This Confucianism is also the inherent culture of China. However, the result is that Japan has become a country that is ideal for Confucius. Chairman Wang once said that a pure Three People's Principles is the inherent culture of China. I deeply believe that the Three People's Principles can not only lead to the Kingly Way, but also to the way of governing the country and pacifying the world. There are many other examples. This one example is enough to prove that the two countries are on the same path, both disciples of Confucius, which is what Chairman Wang called "East Asian compatriots and East Asian comrades."</p>
<p>Q: Today happens to be the day of sacrificing to Confucius. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>A: I have visited Qufu 13 times and met Mr. Kong Decheng. I am still responsible for managing the Yushima Seido. I was originally scheduled to go to Shanghai today, but because it is Confucius' birthday, I changed it to tomorrow. You can imagine how I feel. Q: Dr. Shioya, you have stayed in Nanjing for more than a week. What are you most satisfied with? What are your thoughts? Please share.</p>
<p>A: I am a literary person and I study literature and art. Literary people must have passion and sincerity. My words and deeds come from sincerity. From my observation, what I am most satisfied with this time is that most young people have realized the extent of cooperation between the two countries and have entered into a state of sharing life and death and defeating the common enemy. It is not only necessary to use force, but also to revitalize culture. During this meeting, everyone was able to treat each other with sincerity, which is very gratifying. In addition, what I feel is that Chairman Wang is busy with all kinds of affairs and is diligent in his political affairs, which is especially moving. However, I hope that those who are responsible for assisting him can see more effort than today, because the great cause of building the country and revitalizing Asia cannot be achieved without mutual effort and cooperation.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hope for the Japanese living in the local area? A: I believe that the Japanese living in the local area have many opportunities to contact the people of your country. They should study more and adapt to local customs. This is also a way to promote friendship. The Japanese who have a sense of superiority should especially cherish themselves. Q: I heard that Dr. Shioya's family has been studying Chinese studies for generations and has a deep understanding of Chinese poetry. Since you are visiting China this time, you must have some good works. Can you show me one or two?</p>
<p>A: Yes. I remember that when Chairman Wang visited Tokyo in the old days, I presented a poem at the Imperial Hotel, which contained the line "Same race, same script, seeking old friendship, sharing life and death, forging a new alliance." I was drunk that day. This time I came to Nanjing, I have three works. One has been published in the Mainland New Daily. The other two were presented at Chairman Wang's banquet, and the other was written today to participate in the Confucius ceremony. (The original poems are below) (1) Presented at Chairman Wang's banquet: "Reunion to talk about old times facing the fragrant wine, discussing matters that can turn clouds and rain, if there is no friendship like Lin Xiangru and Lian Po, sharing life and death is empty talk." (2) Feeling inspired by participating in the Confucius Ceremony on Qingming Festival: "It is lamentable that the world situation is chaotic, the peace of East Asia depends on you, you are originally classmates of Confucius, the long-term plan for good neighborliness lies in this writing."</p>

<h3 id="e17">Fierce Battles in Northwestern Caucasus, German-Romanian Forces Launch Fierce Counterattacks, and Prepare for Combined Sea and Air Offensive, German Forces Strengthen Positions South of Izyum <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) Last night, the German News Agency reported that the German military's successful strike east of Oryol greatly consolidated the main line of defense. On Sunday, the main battles on the Eastern Front took place in the southeastern part of the Kuban bridgehead in the northwestern Caucasus. In the past few days, German forces have completed the shortening of their lines in the area and inflicted heavy damage on Soviet forces. It is said that German-Romanian forces, in fierce counterattacks, surrounded and annihilated large Soviet forces. South of Lakes Ilmen and Laga, Soviet forces launched counterattacks against the recently improved German positions, but suffered heavy losses and were unable to continue their attacks. According to the military reporter of the United Press, the Soviet offensive against the Kuban bridgehead has greatly intensified over the weekend, and its scope has exceeded the local nature. Although there is no indication of a large-scale offensive at present, it may be its prelude. The concentration of a large number of Soviet artillery units in the lower reaches of the Kuban River and the large-scale activities of the Soviet Air Force are probably related. Soviet forces, with several divisions and a powerful tank force, launched fierce attacks on the east side of the bridgehead. Before the attack, they shelled with heavy artillery for several hours, but have not yet achieved any victory. The Romanian forces have performed well in repelling enemy offensives. If the Soviet command wants to take advantage of the relative quiet on other fronts to inflict a major blow on the German base in the western part of the Caucasus region, it is not impossible for the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to join in a combined sea and air offensive. The German defenders are prepared to deal with this development.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 6th (Central News Agency) According to news from the Eastern Front, since the 4th, Soviet forces have launched a large-scale offensive in the Kuban River estuary area, centered on the eastern part of the Taman Peninsula, to the port of Novorossiysk, a vast battle line of more than 70 kilometers, where the two armies engaged in fierce battles overnight. In particular, the tank battles between the two armies were even more fierce in the area directly connecting the central oil field of the Taman Peninsula. As of noon on the 5th, the German and Romanian forces were still holding their original defensive positions. The Soviet offensive was unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses, losing 23 tanks. There were no changes on other fronts. It was only reported that German forces south of Izyum are currently strengthening their positions. Soviet newspapers have recently published articles warning the people that the German forces' full-scale offensive is approaching, and they hope that the front and rear will strengthen their defenses. The Associated Press Moscow correspondent also reported on the 5th that the German forces on the Southern Front have completely secured all strategic points and have grasped the railway network, so they can launch a large-scale offensive at any time in all southeastern directions, and occupy an extremely advantageous position, and expressed pessimism about the trend of the war situation.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Axis Forces Re-deployed, Major Battle in North Africa to Restart, British Tank Units Also Transferred to Front, Plan to Launch Offensive Jointly with US Forces <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the military special correspondent of the United Press, General Montgomery has moved his tank forces further forward to the front line, and his artillery units have also begun test firing to explore the range of the German and Italian defensive fortresses in front. It can be seen that the British army will soon attack Marshal Rommel's position. The British attack will generally begin when the US forces under Patton are also ready to take large-scale action. The anti-Axis command obviously attaches great importance to coordinating the cooperation between the British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army. The US military had only unimportant activities on the weekend, attempting to partially improve its position, but was easily repelled by the Axis forces. In the early stages of the Tunisian War, the US military suffered particularly heavy tank losses, so the US Fifth Army may still be very short of this important offensive weapon. Before obtaining sufficient supplies, General Patton may not be able to launch a new large-scale attack. Therefore, how long the current hesitant state of the US military will last depends entirely on whether the anti-Axis supply lines are used quickly. The British forces under General Anderson in northern Tunisia, assisted by French rebels, have made progress, but this is only because the area is located west of the new position defended by the Axis forces after withdrawing from the Jebel Abiot area according to plan. Due to the ingenuity of the German-Italian rearguard strategy, the British army was able to approach the main new line of the Axis forces after several days of battle. The characteristic of the situation in northern Tunisia is that the German army under General Arnim and the British army under General Anderson have not yet used the majority of their troops in battle.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the German official news agency, there were only local wars in southeastern Tunisia on Sunday. US tanks under General Patton advanced eastward on the road from Gafsa to Gabès and southeast of Maknassy, but were repelled by the Axis forces. The situation in northern Tunisia was also quite quiet. British troops are still scouting and probing in front of the Axis positions on the mountains east of Sédjénane, but all have been repelled by the Axis vanguards. US tank forces advanced from the area east of Gafsa towards the road to Gabès, but the Axis forces responded with a superior force. After losing three tanks, the US forces quickly retreated. Southeast of Maknassy, the US military once again attempted to capture the Axis positions on the small mountain. It was quite successful at first, but then the Axis forces launched a fierce counterattack, repelling the US forces to their original positions and seizing several motorized artillery pieces, many infantry light weapons, and two reconnaissance vehicles. According to a Reuters correspondent with the US military in central Tunisia, there is a fierce battle near Kebili, where German forces continue to fiercely resist the right flank of General Patton's forces. Fifteen German dive bombers bombed the US artillery units east of El Guettar this morning. Algiers Radio also said that the German counterattack was particularly fierce east of El Guettar. The Axis command has redeployed its troops further east, and serious battles will occur soon.</p>

<p>Paris, 6th (Central News Agency) The French Ministry of Interior announced that the death toll from the American bombing of Paris on Sunday afternoon is likely to increase significantly. Fifty-nine of the large number of injured people admitted to hospitals have died. According to previous reports, the air raid killed a total of 200 people and injured 500. According to official announcements, Boulogne-Billancourt was the hardest hit by the bombing. American planes dropped a total of 55 bombs, destroying 29 houses completely and severely damaging another 63. The residential area of Suresnes was hit by four bombs. In addition, the Farman factory and the Coty cosmetics factory were also destroyed. Locals believe that the American bombing of the Coty factory proves that it was not targeting military facilities.</p>
<p>Paris, 6th (Central News Agency) According to the Stéphani Agency, on Sunday afternoon, the British and American air raids on Paris not only bombed the Longchamp Racecourse and the Boulogne-Billancourt Sports Ground, but also bombed two venues where sports games were in progress.

<h3 id="e22">Detailed Account of the Japanese Army's Attack on the India-Burma Border, Contact Line Between Chongqing and the UK Severed <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Sunbrapum, Burma, 28th, Yamamoto Special Correspondent) The Japanese army occupied the key street of Sunbrapum on the northern border of Burma and India on the night of March 11. This place is located 135 miles north of Myitkyina and is the Bo River point along the main stream of the Irrawaddy River. The jungle is dense, wild animals roar, and behind the mountain, the Kachin tribe lives. "Brapum" means "mountain" in the local language. From the top of the mountain to the mountainside, bamboo-roofed earthen houses are scattered among them. On the top of the mountain, there are also European-style bungalows for the British to use for hunting and traveling. During the enemy's agitation, the British and American commanders used air transport from India to supply food and supplies to this place, which was the base on the front line. The fall of this place completely cut off the attempt to contact the Chongqing army in Yunnan, and had a great impact on the British and Chongqing armies.</p>
<p>(Same place, 29th, Yamamoto Special Correspondent) After the elite Japanese army annihilated the British army that was agitating in the jungle area on the northern border of Burma and India, they finally completely occupied Sunbrapum on the night of the 11th, blocking the enemy's attempt to connect the Chongqing and British armies, and completely shattering the illusion of a counterattack on Burma. The officers and soldiers of each unit traveled along the Irrawaddy River, in the dense jungle area, climbing mountains and crossing dangers under the attack of enemy planes, fighting hard for a month and a half, and their hardships cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>This attack lasted for a month and a half, and the action was limited to the night. In order to avoid the surveillance of Japanese and enemy fighters, from the early morning mist until the dark dusk, they hid in the jungle, using painting as the night, and took a temporary nap. The action started in the evening. The three meals a day were limited to 9:00 PM, 2:00 AM, and 8:00 AM - at this time in Burma, the sky was not yet bright. Therefore, the soldiers, due to habit, all had the night vision of civets and owls. When they started attacking along the broken cliff road on the Irrawaddy River, which was only one meter wide, they only groped in the dark with their hands, and loaded vehicles and horses were often in danger of falling.</p>
<p>The roars of tigers, leopards, and other beasts were the accompanying music that could be heard from time to time. The reason why this team's nighttime attack was easy to march was due to the hard work of the advance reconnaissance team.</p>
<p>This advance team held mountain knives with the Burmese natives in the deep mountains, cutting thorns and opening paths in the jungle mud path, and building bridges and repairing roads. Landmines were densely laid everywhere, and if they were stepped on carelessly, they would explode with a bang. There were also tethered landmines that were triggered by pedestrians; loaded vehicles and horses, everywhere, and it was impossible to guard against them. The removal of these obstacles was also the hard work of the working team. Use a wooden rolling machine. Model Chen was in a row, and the ox was used to pull it. This cattle unit was a clever way to remove landmines. Sometimes the work of this advance working team changed drastically. Usually in the dry season, rain is rarely seen, but in northern Burma, after the thick morning fog, there is a sudden rain, and the road becomes muddy. Where the landmine exploded, a large gap was opened, and no matter how much soil was filled, it was difficult to level it immediately. They can only cut wood from the jungle instead of stone to fill the gap, so that vehicles and horses can pass.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing in jungle warfare is the sneak attack of mountain leeches above and mountain lice below. Mountain leeches are as small as Ren Dan grains, and often sneak in without being noticed, sucking blood. Although they do not feel pain or itching, the bitten area is as red and swollen as a small finger. Mountain lice are as small as Austrian worms and can sting the hands and feet like a bee sting, which is very painful.</p>
<p>Crossing 100 miles of Myitkyina, from the Irrawaddy River to the foot of the Kumon Mountains, the supply of food and fodder is extremely difficult. In addition to the porridge in the courtyard, they only rely on the pith of the papaya tree and banana tree trunk to fill their hunger. However, the soldiers all endured it as before, marching hard, approaching the northern India border connecting Yunnan and India, crushing the ambitions of the Chongqing and British armies, and completely occupying its important point, Sunbrapum. The great achievements of the Kojima unit and other units will forever occupy a glorious page in the history of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(Special Telegram from Taiping Street, Yunnan Front, 29th, Special Correspondent Zekai) The Japanese Yunnan Expeditionary Force swept away the enemy from the Gaoligong Mountains to the other side of the Nu River and around Tengyue, blocking the contact between the Chongqing and British armies. Furthermore, it advanced westward from Tengyue to the Burmese border to carry out a sweeping war.</p>
<p>The main force of a certain unit that departed from Tengyue on March 7 advanced along the south road, advanced into Yacheng on the 9th, and arrived at Taiping Street via Zhan Da on the 11th. A unit even set out to a certain place near the border on the same night, smashing the enemies in various places. A unit departed from Gan'ai, separated from the main force, and annihilated hundreds of the remnant enemies commanded by General Ming near Dazhai. Arrived at Taiping Street on the 12th. This expedition caused the former ambiguous local divisions in Nandian, Zhan Da, and Gan'ai to cut off contact with Chongqing and pledge allegiance to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The Tusi is a land management agency among the Thai people living in the western region of Yunnan Province. The land in this area is generally managed by the Tusi Yamen, and then distributed and entrusted to the local chieftains of each village by the Tusi Yamen. The people only have the right to use the land but no right to buy and sell it. It is a general manager of a land public ownership system.

<h3 id="e23">The Soul of the Japanese Navy <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The heroic achievements of the Second Special Attack Force have been officially announced by the Ministry of the Navy, and the entire nation is deeply moved. Tatsuo Kawai, the then Japanese ambassador to Australia, was escorted by an exchange ship to return the remains of the four heroes who raided Sydney. At the time of the announcement of the incident, he sent a talk to the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun.</p>
<p>-- Former Ambassador to Australia, Tatsuo Kawai</p>
<p>From the start of the war until I returned to my country on an exchange ship last summer, I was confined to the ambassador's residence in Melbourne for eight months. During this period, the 20 employees of the embassy were not allowed to take a step beyond the threshold. Initially, because the Australian government prohibited newspapers from being delivered, I could not know the situation outside. Later, after negotiations, it was allowed. Then, on June 1 of last year, we were suddenly shocked by a piece of news in the newspaper. The newspaper said:</p>
<p>On May 31, a small Japanese submarine sneaked into the mouth of Sydney Bay and fired a torpedo at a warship belonging to our navy, and was sunk.</p>
<p>Is this true? We held our breath, our nerves felt paralyzed, we tightly grasped the newspaper, and hot tears fell down. At that time, in that kind of place, who could have imagined that Japanese naval warriors would actually sneak into the throat of the enemy capital south of the Solomon Islands! This attack by the invincible Japanese naval soul shocked the seven million people of Australia and its entire territory of three million square miles. The kind of surprise and shock that swept the country was witnessed by my own eyes.</p>
<p>Australian Naval Funeral</p>
<p>After five or six days, the Australian government notified me through the Swiss consul general, who was the protecting power of Japanese interests:</p>
<p>"The four Japanese soldiers who died in battle will be buried with naval honors, and then cremated."</p>
<p>I immediately agreed. He also said:</p>
<p>"When the funeral is held, in view of the current relationship between Japan and Australia, the Japanese ambassador cannot attend, but he can present a wreath."</p>
<h3 id="e24">A Record of the Sneak Attack on Sydney: The Second Special Attack Unit Submarine Displaying Power <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>I left everything to the Swiss Consul-General to handle. The funeral for the four brave warriors was held on June 9th, with Rear Admiral Muirhead-Gould, Commander of the Sydney Naval District, as the chief officiant. The Swiss Consul-General represented Japan and attended, and it was extremely solemn. Afterwards, the Swiss Consul-General told me about the situation very clearly.</p>
<p>The remains of the four brave warriors, covered with the Rising Sun flag, were placed in four coffins and carried to the burial ground by sailors. A company of sailors, dragging their rifles and with heads bowed, solemnly lined up to escort the funeral procession. After three memorial shots were fired, the remains were cremated to the sound of military music.</p>
<p>It wasn't until August 13th, when the exchange was about to depart, that the remains of the four brave warriors, which had been placed in a church in Sydney, were handed over to me. The embassy staff hastily made four shrines and reverently placed the spirits inside. In the courtyard of the official residence, a fragrant branch of the Phoebe zhennan tree was broken off to serve as a substitute for the Eurya japonica. Everything was done in a hurry, just to express our heartfelt sentiments. The scene at that time! It is forever engraved on our hearts and will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>The Families of the Brave Warriors</p>
<p>On the exchange ship from Melbourne to Lourenço Marques, it was so crowded that there was no place to put the spirits. During the four-week voyage, the four shrines were placed in my room. Gazing upon them morning and evening, I was filled with grief and longing as I recalled the heroic deeds of the four brave warriors. When the Kamakura Maru arrived in Yokohama, I met the bereaved families of the brave warriors. The parents of Petty Officer Masao Totsuka immediately asked me:</p>
<p>"Were all the bullets he took with him fired?"</p>
<p>The beloved daughter-in-law of these parents, after seeing the remains of Petty Officer Masao Totsuka, did not grieve excessively. Fearing that she would commit suicide and follow her husband to the afterlife, they rushed from the countryside to her residence and asked her, "Do you have to die in this war?" She replied, "Yes, sooner or later, I will die." "Then your mother will stop thinking about finding you another husband." The two held the daughter-in-law who had lost her husband and slept together for one night.</p>
<p>"Loyalty and Courage" Moved the Enemy Country</p>
<p>The two older brothers of Ensign Takeshi Omori said:</p>
<p>"Takeshi was our youngest brother. Our mother died when he was two years old, and he was raised by a stepmother. Our father, when working in the fields, would also bring him along. He gradually grew up. When we brothers were together, we all said we wanted to be filial to our father. Now Takeshi is the most filial."</p>
<p>In encountering the attitude and words of the families of the fallen heroes, I understood the reason why the Australian government held a naval funeral. It turned out that their heroic deeds of loyalty and courage to their country had deeply moved everyone's hearts. Like father, like son; like elder brother, like younger brother. These Japanese fathers and mothers produced the war gods who attacked Pearl Harbor and also produced the brave warriors of the Cowra, HMAS Stalwart, and Sydney special attack units.</p>
<p>An Enemy Commander Praised</p>
<p>Under the Southern Cross, they went on an expedition across the ocean, with the ambition of using their horse hides as shrouds and seeking to fulfill the will of their motherland. The heroic souls of these four brave warriors stirred the hearts of the entire Australian people. They will study the reason why the colored race of Japan is so strong. Australia, which considers itself the 49th state of the United States, buried these four brave warriors with naval honors. Rear Admiral Muirhead-Gould, Commander of the Sydney Naval District, even said in a broadcast:</p>
<p>"Japanese soldiers came to attack in iron coffins. They had no hope of returning alive. How many Australians have even a fraction of the courage to sacrifice themselves for their country that these brave warriors possess?"</p>
<p>Sincerity Moves Heaven</p>
<p>Sincerity can move heaven. The four brave warriors silently and without words, fulfilled their duties, and also moved the Australian enemies who did not speak the same language. Chinese sages said:</p>
<p>He who practices benevolence establishes his will, acting before speaking.</p>
<p>Beyond a thousand miles, all are brothers.</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty people, skilled in lengthy orations and broad debates, already praised actions without words. Originally, Japan can be said to be a country that does not emphasize words. The self-sacrifice of these special attack unit warriors is a concrete manifestation of the Japanese five-foot body. When recalling these noble heroic souls, there will surely be many who commemorate them not only with words but also with deeds, not just me alone.

<p>Since the widespread sale of retail cooking oil began in this city a few days ago, the situation has been extremely good. According to a Central News Agency reporter, after the widespread sale of this batch of cooking oil is completed, the city's cooking oil wholesale office has secured another 500 tons of cooking oil, which is expected to be available for sale around the middle of this month. The sales method remains unchanged: the concessions will still use housing tax receipts, while the city area will use household registration certificates and residence permits. The amount of oil sold per person, regardless of whether it is in the concessions or the city area, is still set at four ounces.</p>
<p>Purchase Oil with Certificates; Refusal Is Not Allowed</p>
<p>The first batch of oil purchases with housing tax receipts from the cooking oil wholesale office has already begun, with 367 retail oil shops throughout the city selling simultaneously. It is understood that the distribution of this batch of oil to retail oil shops is based on the population of each district and Baojia, and the amount of oil received by each oil shop is a fixed amount. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason for it to be sold out. Citizens can go to the designated oil shops within the stipulated time, with their housing tax receipts and household registration certificates, citizen certificates, etc., to purchase the oil they are entitled to. Each shop must absolutely not refuse to sell without reason. If any of the above situations occur, citizens can report it to the wholesale office or the police authorities for investigation and handling, and their distribution rights will be suspended.</p>

<p>The Xinzha Baojia District Committee recently, due to the continuous rainy days, is deeply concerned that the air raid lamps previously installed at important intersections and in the lanes may be damaged by moisture. Once an air raid begins, it may cause problems. For precautionary purposes, the committee has notified all Lianbao to promptly inspect the lamps and report the names and addresses of the responsible persons (caretakers) to the District Committee for record. In addition, since the liaison officers of each Bao during previous air raids used flags as identification and did not have fixed armbands, which caused obstacles to their work, a special liaison officer armband has been made and distributed to each Bao, two for each Bao, to be distributed to the liaison officers for wearing during air raids. Each Bao is also notified that all air raid personnel, such as the fire brigade, ambulance team, shelter team, guidance team, and reserve team, must be prepared.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Shanghai Municipal Council Prevents Autumn Flooding: Plans to Connect the City's Drains; Large-Scale Project to Be Completed Within the Year <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>According to a source at the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Times reporter, the Works Department of the Municipal Council, in order to prevent the flooding that is often encountered every autumn, which causes backflow into low-lying roads and the formation of water channels, is actively manufacturing 4,000 feet of culverts (drains). Most of them have already been made.</p>
<p>Five Tide Gates Have Been Built</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's flood prevention plan, the scope of which is connected to the culverts, is from the intersection of Dahua Road and Edinburgh Road, via Metcalfe Road, to MacKay Road and the Suzhou Creek. All other large-scale flood prevention projects have also been launched. Among them, the most noteworthy is the construction of five tide gates to automatically prevent flooding. A sixth tide gate will also be built in the near future, but it must wait for the drains to be connected so that the tide can flow into the Suzhou Creek from MacKay Road.</p>
<p>Flood Prevention Plan Covers the Entire City</p>
<p>The flood prevention plan is implemented throughout the city, but except for the above-mentioned areas, the connection of drains in other areas has not yet been completed. As for the higher-lying areas, the drains are not intended to be connected. It is also learned that the Works Department has this plan, which was initially conceived in view of the large-scale autumn floods in 1940 and the influx of tides. The goal is the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River. In the event of an accident, the public concession drains will be connected to the western district of Shanghai. Regarding this large-scale flood prevention project, the source said that it can be completed within this year.</p>

<p>The Waterproofing Committee of the Municipal Works Bureau has determined that the areas along the Fahua Creek, Zhuan Creek, Yong'an Creek, Xiaohe Creek, Zhupu River, Zhuyuan Creek, and No. 14 Creek in western Shanghai are not only detrimental to hygiene due to years of siltation in the creek flows, but also prone to flooding as the mold and plum rain season is approaching. Therefore, the Works Group of the committee is finding ways to dredge and prevent flooding and has decided to order the demolition of houses built along the creeks within a set deadline. It is estimated that there are about 500 households in the shantytowns along the various creeks. The houses are divided into three types: grass sheds, wooden bungalows, and wooden buildings. They are all temporary shelters built by refugees after the incident. The issue of the aftermath of these shantytowns has been assigned by the Waterproofing Committee to find the Zhongshan Road Civilian Village, which is under the management of the former Social Affairs Bureau, as a temporary shelter. Detailed plans and estimates for compensation for the demolition of houses are being prepared and submitted to the authorities for approval.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to Nanjing, a national cultural representatives conference was held in Nanjing.

The conference has now concluded. On the evening of the 5th, the group came to Shanghai from Nanjing and stayed at the Broadway Mansions. The envoys made the following statements:</p>
<p>Healthy Housing: Mr. Takeo Sato's Statement</p>
<p>This is my second time visiting Nanjing. The first time was in Showa 14 (Republic 28), and the impression I got this time is very different. After a short separation of three years, the progress is unexpected. The feeling it gave me is that Nanjing, in addition to its historical and political conditions, also possesses all the superior conditions. At a glance, it is the atmosphere of a capital city. The natural situation is not accidental. The Yangtze River, Purple Mountain, Xuanwu Lake, etc., are all natural dragon-coiling and tiger-squatting formations. It is the most appropriate to make it the capital of the new China. It is not as rigid as Shanghai. Some people also think that urban planning is boring, but I don't think so. China has its own tradition of composing China. We must recognize this tradition. The previous regimes also implemented urban planning, but there were too many places that were obsessed with Europeanization. To urbanize China's local cities, we must first distinguish China's unique traditions and then start anew. This is a point that is worth fully studying. Looking at the housing problem of Japanese residents, we also need to work hard to solve it. To demand the development of Japanese residents, we must have healthy housing. However, because resources cannot be obtained, it has been delayed. The housing difficulties will only tend to become more serious. The housing problem in mainland Japan has already been solved by the invention of housing corporations that produce homes for the war effort. We must also care about this point in China. It is heard that the parties involved are making every effort to promote the construction of healthy Japanese housing.</p>
<p>Cultural Utilization: Mr. Hibiki Saito's Statement</p>
<p>The new China is not active enough in culture. How to utilize culture is a problem. In practice, the work of cultural exchange can only reveal the principles through the creation of a new culture. We understand the current state of Chinese culture. After returning to mainland Japan, we are prepared to actively consult on Sino-Japanese exchange work. We will bring the most advanced cultural groups here and use high culture that stands on a global perspective to achieve real results in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Finally, there is one thing that makes me happy. It is that coming to China and having frank discussions with Chinese cultural figures has yielded many gains.</p>
<p>Completing a Member of the War: Mr. Tokiyo Okushi's Statement</p>
<p>This time we came to attend the National Cultural Representatives Conference hosted by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. It is of great significance that cultural figures from China and Japan can gather together. Japan also had more than a dozen representatives from the academic, artistic, educational, and teaching fields in attendance. All of these are epoch-making feats in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Although there have been cultural exchanges in the past, they only focused on the translation of publications and the dispatch of exchange students. Therefore, the cultural exchange was not fully close. However, with the outbreak of the China Incident, followed by the sudden outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, some people shouted for Sino-Japanese cultural work and carried it out in practice. We call this phenomenon "the discovery of cultural figures." At this time, we must unite the cultural circles of the two countries to promote cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Coming to China this time and having in-depth conversations with Chinese cultural figures, I will, after returning to my country, strive to work in the cultural field based on the teachings I have gained here, using the power of culture to become a member of completing the Greater East Asia War.

<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: Lieutenant General Nomura, Commander of the Japanese Dispatch Army in Shanghai, hosted a banquet at the Astor House Hotel on the evening of the 5th to entertain celebrities from this city. Takashima, President of the North China Development Company, and other leaders from this city also attended the event. At the banquet, His Excellency Nomura delivered a speech, stating that Japan is implementing a new policy towards China, with Shanghai as its center. Therefore, he urged leaders from all sectors of the city's civil administration and military to cooperate sincerely and solemnly declared that the unification of political and military aspects is helpful to the smooth completion of the Greater East Asia War. He also said that the Japanese Dispatch Army in Shanghai will henceforth only handle purely military affairs. Those related to politics, economy, and culture will gradually be separated. The establishment of the Shanghai Army Office, the creation of the East Asia Bureau, and Japan's new policy towards China are all precursors to this step. From now on, the Japanese army will only manage military affairs or everything directly related to military affairs. However, the political and economic situation in Shanghai is closely related to the war situation, so the Japanese military authorities must still care about every move in Shanghai. In the future, in terms of intelligence, it is planned to closely connect with the masses. The Japanese Army Press Department and the combat troops will be united as one to become the front and rear of the East Asia War.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Reader's Forum: A Suggestion for Universal X-ray Examinations of Students in the Entire City <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shufan</p>
<p>Youth is the age when contracting lung disease is easiest. Many outstanding students die from this illness before completing their studies, which has a significant impact on the nation and its people. Therefore, prevention and treatment must be urgently addressed. Below are a few suggestions regarding "Universal X-ray Examinations of Students in the Entire City":</p>
<p>(1) This initiative should be rigorously implemented by the education and health authorities. The scope of the examination should be temporarily limited to high school and university students.</p>
<p>(2) All phthisiology (tuberculosis) doctors, hospitals, health organizations, and X-ray machines in the city should participate, providing their services on a voluntary or free basis. The responsible authorities should coordinate and allocate resources, and students from various schools should go to designated locations on specified dates for examinations. Those who pass the examination will be allowed to continue their studies at their original schools upon presenting their examination certificates. Otherwise, they should be suspended from school for treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Students found to have lung disease should immediately begin appropriate treatment (such as artificial pneumothorax, etc.) if the condition is severe. Those with mild conditions should first be hospitalized or rest at home for three to six months, and then treatment should be adjusted based on the situation. Patients must follow the doctor's instructions and should not make decisions on their own.</p>
<p>(4) Several enthusiastic doctors should be invited to guide the treatment and recuperation of patients, ensuring they are in the most favorable living conditions. This will accelerate their recovery and prevent patients from being tempted and deceived by improper medical practices, which could lead them astray.</p>
<p>(5) The treatment expenses for poor students should be borne by the government or subsidized by donations from all sectors of society. Students receiving scholarships or bursaries (such as the Shen Bao Reader's Bursary) who fall ill should have their medical expenses continued to be covered by the original funding organizations.</p>
<p>(6) Examinations should be conducted annually or every semester to prevent the constant threat of tuberculosis. Whenever possible, all faculty and staff in schools should also undergo the same examinations.</p>
<p>Before these recommendations are implemented, it is hoped that students from all schools (and people from all walks of life) will voluntarily go to the hospitals designated by the current Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign for free X-ray lung examinations. Those who feel they have symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, such as weight loss, fatigue, excessive coughing with phlegm, and neurasthenia, should especially avoid concealing their illness and delaying medical treatment to avoid procrastination and mistakes. It should be understood that treating tuberculosis is no longer a problem today, but early treatment is necessary. The earlier the treatment is sought, the shorter the treatment period required and the lower the treatment costs. Hiding and delaying treatment will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences. Once we are infected with tubercle bacilli, the condition will inevitably worsen without proper rest. There is no chance of escape. Those who rely on their strong physique and resistance should take heed.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Commentary: Rice Prices and General Commodity Prices <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have fallen sharply, and other agricultural products such as eggs and tea have also declined somewhat. As for industrial products, with the exception of soap and cigarettes, not only have they not fallen with rice prices, but they have continued to rise. As the saying goes, "Let them laugh or scold, I will be a good official in my own way." Currently, industrial daily necessities hoarders and dealers also have the "Let them laugh or scold, I will raise prices in my own way" or "Let rice prices fall sharply, industrial products will continue to rise" spirit.</p>
<p>"Food is the paramount necessity of the people." Therefore, in recent years, economists have advocated using rice prices as the standard for general commodity prices. They believe that "When rice prices rise, all prices rise; when rice prices fall, all prices fall." This theory was also embraced by most merchants when rice prices were rising, so they raised the prices of their goods accordingly. However, now that rice prices have fallen sharply, they have abandoned this theory like worn-out shoes and shifted to the new battleground of supply and demand, saying that there is a shortage of raw materials for industrial daily necessities, production is not strong, and demand is constant, so price increases based on the principle of demand exceeding supply are inevitable.</p>
<p>Merchants value profit over righteousness and are indifferent to parting, a common lament throughout history. To seek price increases, there is no shortage of excuses. Scholars' theories are merely used as a pretext for their profit-seeking and wealth accumulation. Reading history, this reporter has often wondered why ancient rulers so often adopted policies that favored agriculture over commerce. Now, I suddenly understand!</p>
<p>In all fairness, all the misfortunes of mankind originate from a single word: greed. Merchants value profit, which is merely an extreme form of greed. However, fortune lies in misfortune, and profit lies in harm. May merchants and general hoarders who read newspapers and commentaries be able to respect themselves, reflect on their actions, and stop taking advantage of the situation, harming others and harming themselves. The evolution of the world has no fixed rules. Today, goods are valuable and currency is light, but who knows if there will not be a day in the near future when currency is valuable and goods are light? Today's upstart may very well be tomorrow's bankrupt.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The Ministry of Industry Established the Industry and Commerce Association Rectification Committee and Held a Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Organizational Issues <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Central News Agency: The Ministry of Industry's Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations have been promulgated, and the previous Industry and Commerce Association Law has been abolished at the same time. From now on, local industry and commerce associations will serve as wartime economic institutions with heavy responsibilities and sound organizations. To implement the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations and strengthen the associations' own organizations, the Ministry of Industry has established an Industry and Commerce Association Rectification Committee. Yu Quan, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, has been appointed as the Chairman, with Wang Jiajun, Director of the Industrial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry; Sun Zuji, Director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau; Zhang Jun, Director of the Special Commodity Transportation and Marketing Administration; Chen Zhong, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau; Xiang Xun, Director of the Commerce Bureau; Lin Wenzhong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Nanjing Special Municipality; Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Tu Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Shen Tong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Jiangsu Province; and Bu Yu, Director of the Economic Bureau of Zhejiang Province, as members. The first meeting was held yesterday (the 5th) at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry. In addition to all the committee members coming to Shanghai to attend, the Minister of Industry himself came to provide guidance. There was a detailed discussion on important issues such as how to classify major commodity industry associations and the organizational procedures for major commodity industry associations and federations. The meeting will last for three days and will continue today (the 7th). Detailed rectification methods will be announced after the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Economic Inspection of North China: Advisor Ishiwatari Gives a Talk <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency): Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here on the 4th to inspect economic matters in North and Central China under wartime conditions. This is his first trip to the north since taking office. When meeting with a group of reporters on the 5th, he specifically discussed the promotion of material exchange between North and Central China and other issues, stating:</p>
<p>Promoting Trade Between North and Central China</p>
<p>After China's entry into the war, the relationship between Allied Bank Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes once experienced fluctuations. After the authorities' statement and explanation, the situation has stabilized, so the promotion of trade between North and Central China and the economic recovery can be rapidly advanced. Central China requires North China to transport large quantities of coal and revive industries in Shanghai and other regions, and then exchange these products for materials from the interior. The large quantities of wheat flour and other materials that North China should transport will also inevitably increase.</p>
<p>Material Exchange Mechanism</p>
<p>After China's entry into the war, the institutions for material exchange are being actively reorganized. The National Commercial Control General Association has already been established, so domestic trade can be controlled. The Economic Review Committee has also held its first meeting on the 1st of this month to determine basic policies. The financial giants in Central China have been cooperating enthusiastically, and the National Government has appointed virtuous and capable individuals as economic advisors, so the control methods can gradually become more smooth.</p>
<p>Price Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the price issue, it has become a serious problem in both North and Central China. Regarding this point, I believe that effective countermeasures must be implemented. In Central China, the price of rice once rose to over 1,700 yuan. Recently, due to measures such as the abolition of restrictions on the movement of materials, it has fallen to around 700 yuan. The price of eggs has also been halved, and the prices of other vegetables have also fallen. In the future, to achieve self-sufficiency in essential goods, it is necessary to revitalize industries in various regions, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Registered Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Will Still Be Temporarily Suspended from Movement <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Central News Agency: The National Commercial Control General Association has received a letter from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry stating that, in accordance with the Minister's instruction, in order to thoroughly investigate speculation in cotton yarn and cotton cloth, all registered yarn and cloth will still be temporarily suspended from movement and should be inspected jointly by the Commercial Control General Association and the relevant industry associations. If unregistered stored yarn or cloth is found, the economic authorities or the Shanghai Municipal Council in the concession area should be immediately notified to detain it for investigation and handling. It is learned that after approval by the Commercial Control General Association, the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has ended on the 3rd of this month. All cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants are hereby notified that all registered cotton yarn and cotton cloth will still be temporarily suspended from movement.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Determined to Eliminate Hoarding: The Authorities Will Strictly Enforce Account Audits <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In order to strictly suppress prices, the Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to severely punish hoarding. At the same time, in order to prevent hoarding merchants from using bank and money shop loans in the form of mortgages to hoard goods, it has decided to audit the accounts of all banks and money shops in the city and urge the banks and money shops to collect outstanding loans from customers so that hoarders cannot circulate funds and harm the market. Therefore, even though today is the first day of trading after the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday for the banking and money shop industry, the market prices of gold and public bonds have all fallen.</p>

<p>Since the Insurance Supervisory Bureau implemented insurance broker registration on January 5th of this year, the deadline was originally set for today (April 5th). In the Shanghai area, more than two hundred insurance brokers have already registered. It is learned that the bureau authorities, in order to protect the interests of brokers and facilitate registration for brokers in Nanjing, Suzhou, and other inland areas, have decided to extend the registration period by two months from today until June 5th. Once registration is completed, the Insurance Broker Association can be officially established.</p>

<p>Policies to enhance production have been initiated by relevant authorities and various civil groups. The Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, established last time, has been operating smoothly since its opening. It has contributed greatly to improving Chinese agricultural machinery and increasing agricultural efficiency. Therefore, all parties have paid attention to the plant. It is heard that the plant is currently designing to establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>In the past, the loans granted by Huaxing Bank in that area were mainly for consumption (funds for moving materials in and out). However, since this spring, loans for the legitimate needs of purchasing seeds, fertilizers, draught cattle, or irrigation equipment have increased. Naturally, there is also a need to establish a farm implement manufacturing plant in Jiaxing. (Continental Daily News, April 6)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Observations on the National Commercial Control General Association (I) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Yan</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control General Association was established on the 15th of this month. The material control led by friendly nations over the years will be officially handed over to the Commercial Control General Association from then on. This shows that the friendly nations authorities are truly determined to cooperate with our civil sector. It is especially gratifying that the persons in charge of this Commercial Control General Association are mostly well-known figures in finance and industry. Therefore, in the future, they will be able to achieve the goal of coordinating supply and demand and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now, from a third-party standpoint, based on my daily experience with the industrial and commercial sectors, I would like to offer some opinions on the Commercial Control General Association:</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Investigation Work: According to economic control, it is important to implement thoroughly. However, to implement thoroughly, a strict investigation organization is essential. If the investigation is not strict, the implementation cannot be thorough. If the implementation is not thorough, black markets, black black markets, etc., can occur at any time, and the original intention of the control will be completely lost. Now, let's take the customs as an example. In the past, the reason why customs revenue was higher than lijin tax and other various taxes was due to the advantages of its simple tax rate and appropriate methods. However, it was also due to the seriousness of its field work and anti-smuggling work. Therefore, although its tax rate has increased year by year (sometimes reaching more than 100% ad valorem), its tax revenue has still continued to increase, which proves the effectiveness of its investigation work. There are many reasons why past material control has not been very satisfactory. However, the failure to thoroughly investigate is one of the main reasons. The reason why the investigation work has not been thorough is due to the lack of a direct agency. Even in terms of the organization of economic police, there have only been signs of it recently, but it has not yet been able to fully exert its efficiency. Now that the National Commercial Control General Association has been established, it does not have a specialized organization for investigation work. Therefore, at present, it can only rely on the assistance of military and police agencies.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Memorable Old Stories <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yusheng</p>
<p>Recently, many prominent figures from the Japanese cultural world have come to China from afar. Many of them are well known to us, especially several in the field of literature. This short article only discusses Mr. Saneatsu Mushanokoji and Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami, simply because I have had the opportunity to meet them in the past and wish to express my humble sentiments. Others, such as Mr. Setsuzan (On) Shiotani, although a renowned scholar, I have only met his son-in-law, Professor Shinshima, and have not had the chance to meet him in person. I will not discuss them in detail here.</p>
<p>What I can write about is only a few things. Speaking of Mushanokoji, we cannot help but recall the famous Shirakaba-ha (White Birch Society) humanitarian writers of the Japanese literary world thirty years ago. The Shirakaba magazine was founded in Japan in Meiji 43 (1910). In addition to Mushanokoji, the mainstays of the magazine included Naoya Shiga, Zenro Nagayo, and Takeo Arishima, all of whom we are familiar with. They mostly came from the aristocracy and were deeply influenced by Rousseau, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Romain Rolland, aiming to love peace and pursue the realization of an ideal world. In particular, Mr. Mushanokoji's works have been greatly valued in China in the past. For example, Mr. Lu Xun translated "A Young Man's Dream" by a Russian author. Other important translations include "Selected Works of Saneatsu Mushanokoji" (Commercial Press, including "A Rose-Colored Girl" translated by Fan Zhongyun, "Ikyu the Little Monk in One Day" translated by Zhou Zuoren, and "A Certain Woman"). "Collected Plays of Saneatsu Mushanokoji" (Chung Hwa, co-translated by Cui Wanqiu and Yang Yunfei, including the plays "Father and Daughter," "Mr. Nojima's Dream," and "Mrs. in the Study"). Xu Zuzheng translated the two plays "Four People and Others" and "Foster Father," and Wang Guru translated the three plays "The End of Mr. Zhang," "A Small Incident in a Family's Infanticide," compiled into the book "Four People and Others." Other single editions include "Love and Desire" translated by Zhang Kebiao, "Younger Sister" translated by Zhou Baidi, "Mother and Son" and "The Lonely Soul" translated by Cui Wanqiu, "Study of Drama" translated by Shen Zai Bai, and "The Life of a Man" co-translated by Mao Yongshang and Li Zongwu. Scattered pieces or new works seen in various magazines are even more numerous. Judging from the large number of translations, we feel that Mr. Mushanokoji is truly someone who can sympathize with the Chinese people and receive sympathy from the Chinese people.</p>
<p>My meeting with Mr. Mushanokoji was due to the introduction of Mr. Qian Daosun. His honest appearance and humble attitude reminded me of the New Village Movement that he and his comrades had promoted in Hyuga, Japan, more than twenty years ago. Although the New Village construction movement has long since stopped, I imagine that his long-cherished wishes, his enthusiasm, and his spirit are advancing with the times, always striving towards the highest state of perfection for mankind! I hope that this time he personally sets foot in this arduous and chaotic Republic of China, he will see the spirit of the Chinese people, a spirit of enduring hardship, honesty, solidity, love of peace, flesh and blood, and backbone, which will surely lead him to develop a deeper understanding and sympathy for us. Mr. Mushanokoji has been to China before, so I don't need to say much here. Let me borrow the words of Mr. O in "A Young Man's Dream" and say it again: "Please forgive my powerlessness, forgive the powerlessness of my words. But I would like you to discern all the admiration I have in my heart for the beautiful country."</p>
<p>Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami is a famous modern Japanese literary critic. There have been one or two telegrams in the newspaper in the past that mistakenly named him as Hajime Kawakami. In fact, they do have family connections. He is currently the editor-in-chief of the "Literary World" magazine, which is a sister publication similar to "Bungei Shunju." In terms of advocacy and literary stance, he is probably close to Kan Kikuchi, Takeo Kume, Yoshio Toyoshima, and Seiichi Funabashi. I have also talked to all of these people except Mr. Toyoshima several times. In my humble article "Shadows of the Heart in a Foreign Country" ("Ancient and Modern" Anniversary Issue), I said:</p>
<p>Mr. Kikuchi's reputation in the writing world has been as strong as ever from the Taisho era in Japan to today, decades later. I don't need to praise him much. I don't understand Japanese at all, and I used English entirely during the conversation. Even if it wasn't alienating, at least it wasn't particularly cordial. Mr. Kikuchi's attitude towards me... is something I will never forget in my memory. However, after reading Mr. Kikuchi's recent article, I suddenly thought of a short story of his with great artistic value, which is his "Beyond Grudges." The content of this story is moving enough to bring tears to one's eyes. The plot of this story can allow a strange Chinese to understand the lives of the Japanese people and their philosophy of life. Although the theme of this story is about the relationship of gratitude and resentment between people, I feel that the relationship between countries, whether it is a rational view or an emotional impulse, may also be able to glean a profound truth from this novel. The reason why I am writing this short article now is partly to thank Mr. Kikuchi... for the great kindness many of them have shown me, and partly because I feel that Mr. Kikuchi can write a masterpiece like "Beyond Grudges," then his expectations and enthusiasm for me can make a deep impression on me and evoke a major response.</p>
<p>When I left Japan, I stayed in Nara on the way. Mr. Tetsutaro Kawakami, the head of "Literary World," rushed to Nara from Tokyo to express his own and Mr. Kikuchi's intention, hoping that I would stay in Japan for a longer time. Our conversation lasted from 2:00 am to 3:30 am. We were wearing short sleeves and bare feet, wearing loose robes. Mr. Daishi Iwatani was also present. I understand their intentions, although I declined their kindness. However, I used a very sincere and enthusiastic sentence to answer my Japanese literary friends. In order to comfort you, I wrote this short article. Even in painful solitude, not a single word in it is not from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Kawakami sent me a letter asking me to write articles for his publication. His letter was also very emotional. I sincerely hope that this time he comes to China, he will do as I advised Mr. Fusao Hayashi: take a look at the actual lives of the Chinese people, observe the real situation of Chinese society, which is not only a responsibility that a literary writer should fulfill, but also for the long-term future of the two great countries of China and Japan.</p>

<p>"Not so good, so I enjoy doing other things at home more."</p>

<p>"But you've learned this craft, but you can only earn some pocket money, there's no big advantage at all..."</p>
<p>They talked and talked, then stepped up a few more stone steps and entered the mountain gate. There were many people in the main hall, and the incense was so thick that it almost made them unable to open their eyes. They passed through the kitchen from the hall to a long veranda.</p>
<p>There were even more people here, sitting and drinking tea. It had become a temporary teahouse. A row of windows opened on the south side, and the view was even better than outside the mountain gate. Undoubtedly, this was a very good teahouse.</p>
<p>"Let's have two pots of tea," A-Wu invited.</p>
<p>Da Gen couldn't say no, because logically he should be the one to invite A-Wu first, to fulfill the duties of a host. However, he never had the habit of going to teahouses to drink tea, so he and A-Wu didn't even think of it when they got here. Now that A-Wu was inviting him, he had to awkwardly say: "Okay."</p>
<p>They chose the only two empty seats by the window and sat down. Most of the people drinking tea were peasants, taking advantage of this rare holiday to stroll around and have some fun. They were chattering loudly, all very happy. As soon as they sat down, the waiter brought the tea to them. They, especially A-Wu, like the others, let go of their voices and talked loudly.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I finally became a real person today!" A-Wu poured a full cup of tea for Da Gen, and then poured one for himself, showing a relaxed and contented expression. (25)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Our Newspaper's Children's Welfare Forum Launches Emergency Street Children Donation Campaign, Aiming for 100,000 Yuan, The More The Better <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The social services department of this newspaper, in commemoration of this year's Children's Day, launched a children's welfare forum. Representatives from twenty-three organizations attended, jointly discussing the issue of aiding impoverished children. All agreed that with the current soaring prices, providing sustenance is even more difficult, and the number of children in care is increasing rather than decreasing. Reintegrating street children is easier said than done. A unanimous proposal was made to relocate and centrally educate them in rural areas during wartime, implementing scientific management, combining work and study, and engaging in production cooperation. A budget of 100,000 yuan is needed to allocate and recommend qualified care homes. We hope that kind people from all walks of life will, based on the principle of loving and caring for children, economize on unnecessary expenses and provide material assistance. The names of the city's child welfare organizations are listed below:</p>
<p>Child Welfare Research Association, China Child Welfare Association, Children's Welfare Association, Children's Protection Section, Social Bureau Relief Center, Children's Care Association, Jingye Orphanage, Buddhist Agriculture and Industry Care Home, Buddhist Infant Protection Institute, Renji Infant Asylum, Holy Mother's Infant Asylum, Vocational Nursery, Labor Nursery, Puyi Society Children's Department, Hudong Commune Children's Department, Huxi Commune Children's Department, YMCA Boys' Department, Xin Puyu Hall Children's Department, Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, Ciji Children's Care Center, Impoverished Children's Craft Institute, Impoverished Children's Care Center, Shanghai Impoverished Children's Home, Shanghai Orphanage, Shanghai Fuyou Institute for Nurturing and Industrial Children, Shanghai Huaiyou Institute, Ciyou Care Center, Youyou Care Center, Pingjiang Care Center, Disaster-Stricken Children's Shelter, Refugee Care Center, Refugee Children's Grain Collection Center, Jiliang Institute Aiyu Hall, Salvation Army Beggar Children's Shelter, Civilian Women and Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital, Chinese Impoverished and Out-of-School Children Relief Center, Chinese Deaf and Dumb Education Association, Zhongshan Deaf and Dumb School, Shanghai Deaf and Dumb School, Zhenguang Deaf and Dumb School, Dumb Youth School, Fu Dumb School, Bethel Orphanage, Immanuel Orphanage, Bethany Orphanage Garden, Tushanwan Orphanage, Christian Orphanage, Catholic Orphanage, True God Church Huile Garden, China Children's Society, Qingzhen Poor Children's Home, Taoist Child Welfare Home, Children's Reformatory.</p>
