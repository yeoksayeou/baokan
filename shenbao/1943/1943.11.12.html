<p>社評</p>
<h3>「第二珍珠港」！　東亞戰局之新發展</h3>
<p>中日同盟新吿成立，大東亞會議熱烈進行之際，南太平洋又傳出了震動國際的大捷音——波根維兩島海空第一及第二次大捷報！德國方面，稱之為」第二珍珠港」，表明其對於世界戰局的重要意義，決不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>波根維爾島海空戰爭的勝利，尙在繼續發展之中，僅就目前所收到的捷報以觀，這二次戰役對於東亞整個戰局的影響，却已很朋顯的指出。綜其意義，有如下三點：</p>
<p>第一，二次大捷直接說明了英美所謂「太平洋大反攻」的脆弱性和前途的黯澹·從義大利事變和德蘇戰局轉變以來，一部分世界人士對戰局感到迷惑，其間英美的宜傳機關更為鼓燥，甚至高喊所謂「太平洋大反攻」，他們的海空軍也頗思一逞，在所羅門羣島一帶展開所謂「跳島作戰」的「反攻」，同時以東南亞洲反軸心軍總司令部之成立為中心，積極推進所謂「奪回緬甸」的戰備。然而，現在波島海空大戰中僅以第二次戰果而言，日海軍航空隊在十四日之短期間，已炸沉及擊沉敵方艦船三十三艘，炸毀二十二至二十三艘，敵大型航空母艦船員喪失約二千人，大型巡洋艦約八百人，巡洋艦約一千四百人，合計驅逐艦等人員喪失達七千九百餘人。實為珍珠港戰役以來最大戰果，而給英美太平洋反攻之夢以猛劇的打擊。</p>
<p>其次，更證明了日本海空軍戰國力之强大，及大東亞戰爭中日本始終居於優勢地位。誠如日本米內海軍大將所說，「此次戰果之大，殆為不能相信者，今對帝國海軍之威力，僅有驚嘆而已。」日本航空部隊勇士，不顧汽油已盡，一意減敵，不期生還。道種「視死如歸」的戰鬬精神，實為大東亞戰爭必勝的保證。</p>
<p>第三，波島大捷，是和緬滇邊境戰局不能分割觀察的。在這次戰役以前，英美方面盡力宜傳反攻緬甸及利用中國基地以空襲轟炸日本，然而，滇南的怒江戰役，浙皖邊境的戰役等等，那一次不充分表現出日本軍隊的戰鬬精神？那一次看得到英美軍隊曾給重慶以實際按助？又那一次會見英美空軍協助重慶軍抵禦日軍的攻擊？正和波島海空戰役一樣，英美在陸空戰塲上不是巧避，就是敗退呢！</p>
<p>「第二珍珠港」的戰役還在勝利開展中，然而它巳經立下不朽的功績，決定了整個東亞戰局的勝利前途，它的値得各方面一致的感佩，是毫無問題的，今天的問題是在大東亞後方的國民，應該如何的本位努力報答前錢將士的辛苦！</p>
<h3>召見海軍幕僚長　日大元帥賜勅語　東條首相電祝古圓司令官</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日十一時三十分戰表：大元帥陛下本日召見海軍慕僚長，對聯合艦隊司令長官賜以動語如次：聯合艦隊舷空部隊此次於所羅門海城奮勇戰鬥，擊毀敵艦隊，朕對之深為嘉許。惟該方面戰局方進展未已，汝衆應愈加奮勉努力，期副朕之信倚。</p>
<p>東京十一日中中央社電　日東條首棺十日對古賀聯合艦隊司令長官以次各關係艦隊司令官發出祝電如次：自敵軍於摩諾島登陸以來，我軍節節勝利，並於第一次及第二次波根維爾海面空戰中，收獲空前之大戰果，泃堪慶賀，於茲謹對海軍部隊之善謀勇戰，衷心表示謝意，並對幾多護國英靈謹致敬弔之誠。今舉國共謀增强戰力，前綫後方形成一體，爭取最後勝利之決意愈形堅固，於此謹祝此次之偉大戰果，並祈閣下及將兵各位之武運長久。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營發表戰果之正確，中立國方面自無否認，各敵國亦已承認，，此間朝日新聞特就此點評論謂：日軍勇士並非僅蠻喊軍歌止於活潑而已，海軍士官學校學生，縱唱一軍歌，亦須經過嚴慎之指導，以期正確，日海軍之傳統精神中，決無絲毫苟且與虛偽之觀念。關於正確二字，一般海軍士官學校學生，均受有澈底之訓練，一秒半秒之差，即魚雷是否可命中敵艦之分岐點，因此須於平時養成隨時注意正確之精神，僅僅主觀之正確典眞實（客觀）之正確，實有天淵之差，以上即日海軍雖於唱歌時亦不苟且之主因。日大本管之發表，具有舉世無比之正確性者，亦非出於無因，所謂率沈之敵艦，自僅限於目擊之事實，日軍勇士於戰後返還基地時，即由駕駛員等召開類似確認戰之協議會，首先着手調查敵艦中彈若干發，再由多數目睹者報吿敵艦沈沒悄形，兩者一致後，決定為擊沈，敵艦若命中魚雷兩枚，則多半沈沒，若未能目睹敵艦沈沒時，則發表1為負重傷，若有曾見敵艦傾斜搖動之報告，則認其為負輕傷。又過去屢有海軍戰果之追加發表，此乃於未歸還機駕駛員返回基地時，攝有敵艦沈沒之照片，而確認負重傷或輕傷之敵艦為被撃沈者，以上均足表示日大本營發表堪跨耀之正確性。</p>
<h3>日海軍機撞敵艦　乃發揮自炸精神　佐藤市朗中將發表談話</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日海軍機衝撞敵艦之崇高精神，實令人欽敬，此種精神，非哲學與倫理使然，乃為天皇陛下犧牲一己戰至最後打擊敵軍之自炸精神，繼淸宮·納富兩大尉之後，於第二次波根維爾島海面空戰中，又有三中隊長自炸。日海軍中將佐籐市郎氏，頃就指揮官率先衝撞敵機之自炸精神，發表談話，其大意謂：凡我國民，如認軍人拼生命·輕若鴻毛，不畏死亡，任意犧牲，則為完全鍇誤，軍人最注意共生命，豈能輕易犧牲為大元帥陛下奉公之軍體乎。若為報效國家，無論何時亦勇往直前，決不畏縮，自炸亦然，欲始終一貫完成任務，乃以自炸為其最善之手段。已曾目視日機矗炸珍珠灣之役，美新聞紀者報道稱：余親見日海軍機獨特之自炸，其巧妙操縱，已為炸火包圍之飛機，衝撞目的物，決非單練之胡亂猛進，實為戰鬥精神之表現云云。去年南太平洋海戰時，我絮敵機一架，曾誘導出動攻擊敵艦隊之海軍機隊作戰，該索敵機·曾一度返還基地，即毅然轉同機首，於攻擊部隊出發前，捷足先登，雖知燃料不足，不能再度歸還，然因鑒於海上最難發現敵膽隊，若發現時機稍遲，即喪失攻擊機會，乃置自己之生死於度外，毅然出陣。常時該索敵機機長，即已決意自炸，預備學生出身之某士官，早有自炸之壮志，今乃如戰以償勇致自炸，未再歸還，又某下士官身中敵彈，即圍繞友軍編隊飛行一週，作別離寒喧，然後自衝敵艦飛去而自炸，有突然決意者，亦有早經決意自炸者，並無「自炸」之教科書及說明自炸方法之書籍，僅有前輩遺留之能錄而已。淸宮·納富兩大尉及三中隊長之自炸，即「活的教材」，指導官機率先實行衝撞敵艦，部下自無退縮之理，此非學校教官授與之戰法，乃追隨先輩及戰鬥研究之結果。</p>
<h3>日機襲擊　印度東部</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據新德里來電：印度軍當局十日發表稱，日軍轟炸機九日曾轟炸印度東部國境附近之英空軍基地，該軍擊受相當損害，並有死傷者。</p>
<h3>美海部宣佈　三驅艦沉失</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　華盛頓息：經過一長時間後，美海部復於日昨宣佈損矢騙返艦三艘。「享萊」號及「西佛萊」號為最新式者，前者之徘水量為一五〇〇噸，其速度為每小時四十哩。裝有十二·七生的米突砲四專及其他輕軍械，並有放射魚奪管十六支，其建造年鵪為一九三六——三七年。「西佛萊」號亦為戰時所造，屬於大型驅逐艦，其排水量為二·一〇〇噸，裝有十二·七生的米突砲八尊，此項驅逐艦之水當設備甚完備，但官方公報中並未透露。以上二艦均於所羅門島附近海面沉沒者，但第三艘「波里斯」號（一·一九〇噸）乃在大西洋中沉沒者，其建造年為一九一八年，此艦比驗不重要，故僅駛行於大四洋。按諸逋太華協定，英方担任保護北大西洋之護送船團，故「波里斯」號必沉於南大西洋。官報中謂共沉沒非因敵方之攻擊，殊難置信。復稱船員水手有犧牲者，顯有矛盾，故其沉沒或有其他理由。</p>
<h3>日機大舉奇襲　老河口機塲</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　據華中日軍某基地來電，駐渝美空軍與渝空軍聯合，為　同頹勢，乃努力强化鄰近和平地區之基地，企圖反攻中國方面日陸軍機隊，日空軍知其企圖，乃於十日上午，以大編隊大舉奇襲敵基地老河口機塲（宜昌北方百七十公里，）將該機塲滑行路軍事設施三處炸毀起火，更完全炸毀貯油倉庫一間，日機全部安返。</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　據華中日軍某基地電，日軍一部與河口新魏寺相子溪方面之日軍，追擊作戰相呼應，自暖水街北方迫擊渝暫編第六師，已進抵赤溪河（暖水街西北二十七公里）西方。九日晚，渝暫編第六曾轉作反攻·當經日軍正面邀擊，並將其退路完全切斷，到處摧毀其反攻企圖，日陸軍機更曾於九日晚十日晨問，對該方面渝軍掃射轟炸云。</p>
<p>漢口十一日中央社電　日轟炸機大編隊十日上午一時四十分，襲擊渝軍第十三師根據地長陽（宜都西南二十公里），炸毀該地軍事殷施，並轟炸掃射附近之第十三師及第三十師渝軍後，全機安返根據地。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電據華中日軍某某地電，日陸軍機隊，日來於渝軍第六戰區極為活躍，收獲戰果頗大。茲略誌其活動悄况如次：　日機大編隊為殲減被日軍追入巴山之孫述仲所部第七十九軍，第一九四軍，第九十八師，及暫編第六師等部渝軍，在某地發現正沿河遁走之渝軍主力部隊，當即加以轟炸，並作低空飛行，用機槍予以掃射。　日軍府衝轟炸機隊，曾於某地山峽中，發現企圖阻止日軍進攻之吳奇偉所部江防軍第八十六軍，及第十集團軍，當予以轟炸及掃射後，全機安返。</p>

<h3>棉花統制會　委員已內定</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　關於商統會之棉花統買機構，業經第八次物資統制審議委員會決議通過，設置棉花統制委員會，及其下屬機構之棉花收買同業匬會。關於棉花統制姿員會委員人選，大致鈞已內定，主任委員行政院已決議特派唐壽民兼任，副委員長爲日方菱田逸次，中日變方委員共計十三人，最近即可由國府正式任命，此外關於統買價格收買資金，琍正慎密匬商中，預料可於最近展開其收買工作，又旣經內定之中日委員十三人，曾於日前在上海中央儲備銀行內舉行關於棉花統買至匬議會，茲將棉花統制委員會內定之委員名單探誌於後：主任委員唐　民，副主一任委負菱田逸次，童侶靑，委員：中國方面聞闡亭（紗廠聯合會理事長商統會理事），童侶靑（華中棉花統制會副理事長商統會理事），江上達（紗商聯合會副理事長原棉委員會委員長民豐紗廠總經理商統會理事），郭順（永安紗廠及永安公司總經理商統會監事），陳保初，童果夫。日本方面菱田逸次，（裕豐紡績），堤孝（華中棉花統制會理事長），藤田操（大日本紡織），友永藤三則（日看花紡</p>
<h3>基輔前綫德軍　採彈性防禦戰　蘇大包圍計劃失敗</h3>
<p>柏林十一中央社電　海通社訊：聶伯河中游戰事愈演愈烈，徹更以重兵擴大基輔之缺口，連續實施猛攻。德軍行動仍以保全實力，採取彈性戰略為主要原則，並進而謀防止突破之策，故德軍已於前日避離基輔柯洛斯坦公路與瑪拉哥夫迤四地區，俾以有用之流動部隊，對付向基輔西南推進之敵軍。前日敵軍坦克車隊正在該處作楔形之推進時，即遭德軍反攻，襲撃其側翼，遂將敵先頭部隊與所被克復之鄉村間之聯絡，加以切斷，坦克車大戰琍正在進行中。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央設電　海通社訊：德蘇雙方指揮部，均以部隊增援基輔區之作戰，琍正在該城之西北·西·及西南面劇戰·在基輔之南·漸向更南推進，在柏里查斯拉夫爾之南面聶伯河套，琍已包括在基輔戰區之內。蘇軍企圖使基輔區德軍實力削弱，故在聶伯河套向西及西甫方面發動新攻勢，但被德軍所阻。德軍事方面觀測謂，基輸區之戰事，將繼總下去，在德人之意見，以為蘇軍企圖大包圍德軍之計劃，並不能實琍。蘇方之原意，蘇軍之一拑形，係自基輔移動，而在更南面則自克里伏洛格之西北區移動，作另一鉗形。德軍洞悉蘇軍之奸計，即以撤退其軍隊及在克里伏洛格之北反攻，此種反攻，使南面之鉗形，不能動作，而使其全部包圍計劃失收。自七月五日，蘇軍發動大規模攻勢以來，蘇軍從未達到以袋形包圍德軍之目的，而德軍於以前之作戰中，則常有成功者。對於戰事之將來發展，德軍力能阻止蘇軍席　前綫之企圖，而蘇軍之包圍之計劃，已全歸失敗矣。</p>
<h3>白宮再度召集　軍事領袖會議　羅邱斯會唔之先聲</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據華盛頓消息稱：羅斯福邱吉爾及斯造林三人會議，準備似有進展。羅斯福總統最近典其軍事顧問馬歇爾將軍，會海軍上將·安諾德將軍曁海軍部長諾　斯等舉行會商，據云，此舉即係羅邱斯會議之先聲。</p>
<p>克裡米亞地勢素描</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據海通社訊：克里米亞半島北端，琍為戰爭最激烈之處。半島與大陸述接之處有三，而以貝萊科普地峽為最重要，其餘二者，一即阿拉巴特走廊，位於亞索夫海之上，長約一百公里，迤於地尼契斯克附近，使寇許半島與俄羅斯南部平原相連接，其西不遠在薩爾科伏附近，又有一廣約爾公里之地峽，通至梅立托波爾之鑀道郎由此經過。蘇軍對於該兩狹小之述接處曾施猛攻未逞，今僅以大砲轟擊而已。在薩爾科伏附近之地峽與貝萊科普地峽之問，有所謂西伐許，一名爛污海，（Rottensen）以共水僅一至二公尺深，混濁無異泥淖，幾能涉水而過，因以為名。蘇軍於十一月一日進攻貝萊科普附近之德軍陣綫失收後即擬渡爛污海，以包抄德軍之側，但亦未成功，因此戰事重心今已移至具萊科普地峽矣。</p>
<h3>美國的排斥東亞人</h3>
<p>— 艾明</p>
<p>美國的新戲</p>
<p>據最近從華盛頓傳來的情報，美國又搬演一齣討好重慶的妙戲。那就是修正有名的排斥東方人的移民法，例外的許可重慶方面的中國人入國，也就是山姆大叔諛媚蔣介石的另一手段，美國人中間，對於排斥中國人表示不平之聲，最近甚囂塵上，他們似乎眞的有這一種主張。這一九二四年實施的移民　，規定把東亞的一切民族常作劣等人種，而不和歐洲的諸民族受同等待遇。一般美國人究竟淸華地知道這一點嗎？為什麼要把有悠久傳統和高度文化的中國及日本民族，當作劣等人種看待而排斥呢？美國拒絕中日二國人民以及其他亞洲人，和歐洲的捷克人，斯拉夫人，波蘭人，立陶宛人及其他民族，受同等的待遇。</p>
<p>人種的偏見</p>
<p>人種的偏見是國際間不和的大原因，而又爲戰爭的直接勳機。標榜人道主義的美國，故意把自尊心很強的東亞諸民族，當作劣等人種而加以侮辱。美國准此次大戰中，公然聲言為救濟這些東亞民族而戰，那不是一種矛盾嗎？美國式的道德伴，或許允許這種偽善，然從東方的見地看來，那是絕對不許的矛盾。那麼排斥東亞人種的眞正動機何在？移民問題是沒有眞正原因的。因為巾日二國即使不適用這種排斥法，每年從二國入國的移民也不超過一百名。排斥東亞人的原因自然另有所指。我們可以斷定誔，那無非是從人種的偏見的立塲，為排斥東亞人而排斥而已。</p>
<p>自從實施此惡劣的法律，繼續排斥法之後，這幾年來，極度地阻害了日美的國交。在權利義務問題上辨別很淸的美國人，對東亞人閉鎖了本國的門戶之後，東亞人當然也有把美國人關閉於束亞之外的權利這一點是沒有人可以反駁的。</p>
<p>戰爭的動機</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的動機，及建設大東亞共榮圈的動機，實可誔由於英美人的排斥東方人發其端。因為美國及其他新世界拒絕東方人的入國，結果，東亞人除在自已的領城內，即東亞區域內維持其生存及發展外，別無生存之道。</p>
<p>再看一逷五日在束京舉行的大束亞會議的宣言：</p>
<p>大東亞各國共同確保大東亞之安定，以道義為基礎，建設共存共榮之秩序。</p>
<p>大東亞各國互相尊重其自主獨立，力求亙助敦睦，以確立大束亞之親和。</p>
<p>大東亞各國互相尊重其傳統，發展各民族之創造性，以關揚大東亞之親和。</p>
<p>大東亞各國本於互惠，緊密提携，以促進其經濟發展，增進大東亞之繁榮。</p>
<p>大東亞各國增進萈邦之友誼，撤廢人種的差別，普行溝通文化，進而開放資源，以期貢獻於世界之發展。</p>
<p>這宣會中並不欲從東亞共榮對中排斥美國人，我們不過欲為東亞人保全東亞的領域。雖然已經失之過遲，美國也已　得其排斥法的不公平而琍在正欲加以修正。我們對其推移深感興味而加以注視。然據華盛頓來的詳報，美國並非欲完全修正這排斥法，不過祗對重慶方面的中國人設一例外而已。那就是誔，在排斥東亞人的根本精神上，不欲加以何等變更。</p>
<p>换言之，美國不過要討好重慶，而利用此重要問題。其目的不在於正義而在於利害。假使美國眞正覺得自已的不對，而欲矯正其過先，何以祗對重慶方面的中國人撒消這限制呢？</p>
<p>修正案失敗</p>
<p>對日本人又如何？不用誔，日本和美國誔在戰爭狀態中。但這狀態和那限制是另一個問題。一時的琍象，不能和永遠的人種問題相混渚。美國人假使用這精神欲加以修正，則其修正案的必致失敗，瞭若觀火。不引起更大的感情被裂，已很幸運了。恐怕重慶也決不以此為滿足吧！其他大束亞民族，大概將因此感到更大的不滿。綜合這幾點誔來，美國在此次大戰中倡導的正義人道，僅是口頭的，絕對不欲琍之於實際。攪亂世界和平，濕渚正義人道的實在就是美國。</p>

<p>陳氏謂當局過去對於日用品已辦理配給者，計有米·麵粉·牛奶·牛油等，而已在積極計劃中、即將辦理配給者，計有肥皂及火柴兩種，須經考慮而不久亦將籌劃配給者，有鹽·煤球·食油·及工業所需之煤炭等。吾人今除對配給事宜加緊進行外，今後對於抑平物價亦將開始作進一步之措置。本人以為抑平物價之最重要辦法，厥在嚴加執行當局已定限價，經濟處今已再度將製造商，批發商零售商，分別評定新限價，由本處之「調查執行科」派員切實調查各廠商是否遵照當局限價發售物品。本處派員出外調查廠商時，為三人一組，對於　商帳　更將抽查。期以村絕囤貨行為發生，調查員在執行職務時，須出示本處頒發之「經濟處職員身份證」，證上貼有該　查員之照片，否則可加以拒絕。調查員於調查廠時，態度務須和藹，此外調查員無商如　有形跡可疑或行為不正直調查員時，可扭送附近之　捕或自　，再　報告本經濟處，務使杜絕此類不幸事件發生。</p>
<p>肥皂火柴　定期配給</p>
<p>陳氏繼述及經濟團體管理科職權，掌理本市各同業公會登記　　督指導事務，該科每星期至少有一次或二次會議，召集各同業公會團體之本均業務，以符合戰時體制下之組織，故各同業公會本身之使命，在會員方面，無綸調整產銷，及規定限價上，以利予，　滴合戰時體制，　不違反經　規則，凡本市各同業公會，即已在商統會登記者，亦須向本處辦理登記云云。旋經濟處又發表關於配給肥皂之報道，配給肥皂之手續，與其他物品不同，　廠商之衆多，出品不同，故在計　時頗為困難，如請一家廠商出品配給仝市每一民為五星皂。經濟處為　皂配給，特鄭重聲述，此項配給皂之分量稍異，而其品質絕無瑕疵，定於本月十八日開始發售，計口　皂票劵，除外人外，華人已金部發竣，屆時均可向指定零售店購取，每人每月限購一塊。至火柴亦定於本月十六日起發售，票劵亦已發給區內華人，每人每月限購一包，其出品為金鼎火柴，每盒火柴之標準為九十根。配給價格將由該處在實施之前一日，以佈告方式公佈，聞價格頗廉。</p>
<p>煤球食糖　處置辦法</p>
<p>陳氏又答記者問，發表當局對於煤球及食糖問題市價各飛漲，其原因為來　不暢，然其主要則為好商囤積。現　濟處正加緊不貸。關於煤球何日能實施配給，現尚難發表確切日期，不過將來一日配絲後，其價格當極力抑壓。　食糖：日來外界有食糖食糖之採辦，今已據充至三省二市，故食糖來　，　無處　乏，當能依原配給量發配，食糧之配給由「糖商合作營業處經手辦理，十月及十一月份配給日期　延，其主要因在價格問題之商榷，今後當能依照原有辦法配給。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>貢獻於一區經濟處</h3>
<p>上海特別市第一區公署經濟處成立之主要鵠的，無疑地，是在於如何使地方食在生活必需品方面，不發生生產力低下，配給不圓　，民心不安定等等弊　，因此，我們對於一區　齊處當局前此所表示如何努力於生活日用品之普遍配給，非法交易之嚴厲制戴，以及一般商情之澈底調查等等方針，不禁欣然於　，認為是為市氏造福的一個機構。</p>
<p>如今，一區經濟處對於人民生活日用品之一部門，如肥皂火柴配給事宜，業經佈置就緒，即將普售，其　心規　，刻意安排，以為地方人民生計着想之苦心，自不待言辭之協助，已足使　人憬然知所感覺了。我們於擁護一區經濟處的經濟施策之餘，願以兩句話來買獻於一區經濟處的當局，就是：　置其緊急者於重點，　認為必要者則實施。第一句話的意義日是：凡是屬方生活必須品的最緊急部門—例如火柴—則儘先實施普遍的配給。我們　於煤球為居民一日不可或斷之必需燃料，而目前形勢之嚴重，足以令一般貧戶斷炊，此即我們所認為配給問題中的一個重點。第二句話的意義是：凡是有非法抬高市價者，尤其在某一種某一項物資感覺缺乏時，則不妨隨時便宜行事，强制執行限價，俏然發覺再有故違，祗圖私利　暴利，靑置大衆生活前途於不顧者，則實行斷然的處置，正所謂非常之時，不妨有非常之法。</p>
<h3>商統會積極推進　南北物資交流　訂定具體方案即將實施</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，對於溝通南北二地之物資，進行不遺餘力，查戰前二地物資，交流本極充暢，現因交通阻隔關係，甫下物資較北運者為少，此對於二地之整個經濟發嚴影響至巨。現商統會方面即付諸實施，大的北運之物資為麵粉及米糧等，以交換北方之油糧石炭等。</p>
<h3>商統會增設　九江辦事處</h3>
<p>商統會武漢分會為使武漢區域內統制工作有效起見，在各地分社辦事處，　與分會取得密切連洛。最近該分會在九江增設辦事處，內分設庶務，業務，調查三股云。</p>
<h3>武漢地區　徵收通行稅</h3>
<p>本月十日起實行頃據財政界方面消息，武漢地區，自　月十日起，對商人貨物之往來，開始徵收通行稅。此項通行稅之徵收辦法，為對華百分之十，最低額為百分之五。對日商貨物，經日，一律自十一月十日起開始徵收。</p>
<h3>企業新聞　不日創刊</h3>

<h3>理想的苦兒樂園</h3>
<p>— 白門</p>
<p>訪問上海慈幼敎養院記</p>
<p>詩情畫意的大興路上，從整齊的街樹行列中，露出一座四層洋樓的上身，飛溢出扣人心鉉的音樂。一會兒，　聲低沉，傳來的是孩子門賽球的聲浪。是什麽富人的別墅或是貴族化的學府吧？誰會料到，這裹收容的是些被壓追被遺棄和被討厭的一羣野孩子呢！</p>
<p>現代化慈幼院</p>
<p>中國現代化的慈幼事業的歷史，並不怎麽悠久，總共不過數十年，首先舉辦救濟和教養苦難兒童事業的，邇推外國來華的教團，當他們辦有成績之後，方才有國人自動起來舉辦。所以我國慈幼軍業，大約分為兩個主要源流。一，外人在華舉辦的慈幼事業，其規模最大並且以慈幼工作為專業，因而成績優越至今不衰的，為的斯高慈幼會，是義大利人主持的，現在上海徐州香港澳門昆明曲江等處都有他們所辦的事業，二·國人白辦的慈幼事業，首推中華慈幼協會。這會在全國各地也都辦有各種救濟和敎養苦難兒童的事柴，上海怒幼敎養院就是最主要的一個。</p>
<p>嬈淑文先生，上海敎幼教養院的主任，一位茲祥而幹練的北國典型的女士，說起該院的沿革，也經過一翻艱苦奮鬥的過經。原來該會誕生於民國十九年三月，初創辦時在上海虬扛路。不久「一二八」戰爭爆發，遷至姚主敎路。局勢平定後，又遷同虹口，先在匯山路，後至唐山路，直到民國二十五年，纔算遷定於現在的院址——第八區大興路（舊瑣要德路）一二三一號，說起來，　有孟母摞鄰三遷的意義，因為救濟及教養苦難兒童，第一得慎重選擇環境啊！</p>
<p>上海慈幼敎卷院是中華慈幼協會主辦的兒章福利事業·最高負責人是常董林康侯，趙晋卿，吳維德三民，院內一切教訓等護等實際工作，都在主任姚淑文女士的領導之下，敎職員如張心恰小姐等等，全都是高級師範科畢業，並富於社會敎育經騐的，每人都須兼負教　和一般院務，没有工役，沒有保姆，沒有特別的職員，一切事都須靠他們七八位露負起來·每天幾乎沒有一點空暇。就是晚問也須間時照顧兒童。他們相互間還須經常討論研究兒童福利工作之理論與實賤方法，而由於經費的不足，　們的生活。比一般小學敎員還要清苦。</p>
<p>已經要十三年六個月了！她們寫下了許多可歌可泣的燦爛的史詩。她們收容過八百九十四名男女苦兒，其中巳經學成或找到</p>
<p>新生的小天使</p>
<p>洽號星期日，校闡裏集舍着兩隊學生在像樣的比養足球。一個十歲左右的，口啣哨子，好一個指揮者　姚主任笑着說，「　他像是很優秀的孩子吧！不錯，他是這裏的優秀兒意，可是，却有一段不很平凡的故事咧　」原來這孩子是個在上海戰事中失去丁父母和栩當裕的家廳的可憐者，爲該院所收得他尚有一個生活過得去的姑母，為了院中經費有限，就請奾傾囘。可是，不久之後，姚主任在什麽。路的電車站邊，看到一個此目很熱的小癟三，低着頭·從　身邊迅這的擦過，痩弱的小身子，幾乎跌　在地上了。仔細一認不正是自己救濟教　了不少日子的能炳華嗎？姚主任的眼淚，不自禁的突眠而出！趕快迫到他，詢問結果，知道是姑母遺棄了他到別處去了，只好在馬路討飯度日，可是，他是巳經有了敎養的人在討販中也受到特別的痛苦，因為他不肯去偷去搶啊。後來考騐結果，幸而一點也未受懸習所染，就在該院恢復光明的工讀生活，由於天資聰敏，品行端正，他現在巳修畢完全小學，考進本布靑年中學。變成一個前途無限光明的少年了　他現在每天還囘院住宿，以院為家，並且有一位熱心慈善本業的某決人慷慨擔任他的敎育變呢，</p>
<p>主任興奮地講述着諸如此類的孩子們的故事，　錄下來，幾乎可以編成一本厚厚的「苦見成功記」的專集呢！「看吧，進裹，這個小房間，是我們另外兩個成功的兒童的宿舍？」兩只軍人化的床位，旁邊一只童字桌上整齊地排列着些圖書，壁上掛着民族解放偉人的相片和他們自己的作息時間表，字寫得像印刷品那麽工　和美麗，其中之一位，因為星期日，巳囘宿舍在忙着做些什麽，就是不久以前考取中報助學金而在大同大學附中矣年級欵樂的王有璞君</p>
<p>他戰，像他那樣由上海慈幼敎養院培養成功而升學的還有許多成績最優秀，有女生張月華，現在金紅。在浦東中學初中三年級；王月靑，在民立女子中一年級，男生除上面說的那個熊柄華在靑年中學在育羣中學初中一年級。此外，如女生尤葆，許梅，和考取申報助學金的慈嬰，考取新聞報貨學金的在新本女中初中一年級，所有這些女中初中一年級，慈幼敎養院還繼讃擔負着家長的責任咧。</p>

<h3>望海樓居士　捐助學生免費病床</h3>
<p>貴館舉辦貸學生，鄙人極表同情，自慚棉薄，未曾捐助。今商得佛光療卷院同意，凡貸學生患傷寒雜症，無力醫藥如需住院療養者，憑貴館書面證明，得該院醫地診斷許可，均可入院治療，月限三人，所需住院醫藥費槪由鄙人擔負。該院佛法慈悲，病房取費低廉，凡有疾病，願入該院療養者，悉皆歡迎，上午門診給藥，院址馬斯南路一二三號，望海樓居士謹上。</p>
<h3>凍瘡預防法</h3>
<p>冬天又到了，許多人都免不了要生凍瘡，在外工作的人典主婦們生了凍癐一定將感到不使，而且　又將費去許多無謂的金錢。現在天氣尚未十分寒冷，為避免臨渴掘井起見，先來一個預防的方法。就是，每晚上在臨睡前用冷水擦足部（最好不用熱水），再用生實擦。然後塗一些凡士林之類的油膏。這樣做來，可以不再會生凍瘡，讀者不妨一試。（程起鵬）</p>
<h3>曇花展覽</h3>
<p>靜安寺路三五四號大觀藝圃，係名書晝家張中原江寒汀兩氏所創，該圃隊列曇花數盆，花瓣正在蓓蕾預計今日（十二日）下午開放，據云得之于某大叢林為海上罕見之佳品，有賞花之癖者，當無不以先覩為快也。</p>
<h3>響應寒衣捐</h3>
<p>閱九日貴報貧師請求寒衣一則，怦然感動，茲送上儲券五百元，為貧師為裁添寒衣之需。鄙人明知此數甚為渺少，甚願社曾仁人君子本尊師之心，量力捐助，俾集液成裝，，使為人師者得以溫暖，成續敎學，賓為幸甚智記上。（按欵已收在當代轉送）</p>

<h3>"Second Pearl Harbor"! New Developments in the East Asian War Situation</h3>
<p>Amidst the establishment of the new Sino-Japanese alliance and the enthusiastic progress of the Greater East Asia Conference, news of a major international victory has emerged from the South Pacific: the first and second great victories in the air and sea battles of Bougainville Island! The German side has dubbed it the "Second Pearl Harbor," indicating that its significant impact on the global war situation is no coincidence.</p>
<p>The victory in the air and sea battles of Bougainville Island is still unfolding, but based solely on the current reports of victory, the impact of these two battles on the overall war situation in East Asia is already very clear. In summary, its significance lies in the following three points:</p>
<p>First, the two major victories directly demonstrate the fragility and bleak future of the Anglo-American so-called "Great Pacific Counteroffensive." Since the Italian incident and the shift in the German-Soviet war, some people around the world have felt confused about the war situation. During this time, Anglo-American propaganda machines have become even more agitated, even shouting about the so-called "Great Pacific Counteroffensive." Their naval and air forces have also been eager to show off, launching a so-called "island-hopping" "counteroffensive" in the Solomon Islands area. Simultaneously, with the establishment of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters as the center, they have actively promoted the so-called "recapture of Burma" war preparations. However, now, in the Bougainville Island air and sea battle, considering only the second battle results, the Japanese naval air force, in a short period of fourteen days, has already sunk and damaged 33 enemy ships, destroyed 22 to 23 ships, and caused approximately 2,000 casualties among the crew of enemy aircraft carriers, approximately 800 on heavy cruisers, and approximately 1,400 on cruisers, totaling over 7,900 casualties among destroyers and other personnel. This is the largest victory since the Pearl Harbor attack and deals a severe blow to the Anglo-American dream of a Pacific counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Secondly, it further proves the strength of the Japanese naval and air forces' fighting power and Japan's consistent dominance in the Greater East Asia War. As Admiral Minei of the Japanese Navy said, "The magnitude of this victory is almost unbelievable, and one can only marvel at the power of the Imperial Navy." Japanese air force warriors, disregarding their depleted fuel, are determined to reduce the enemy and do not expect to return alive. This "willingness to die" fighting spirit is truly a guarantee of victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the great victory on Bougainville Island cannot be observed separately from the war situation on the Burmese-Yunnan border. Before this battle, the Anglo-American side did their best to promote a counteroffensive in Burma and the use of Chinese bases to bomb Japan. However, in the Nu River battle in southern Yunnan, the battles on the Zhejiang-Anhui border, and so on, which one did not fully demonstrate the fighting spirit of the Japanese army? In which one could one see the Anglo-American forces giving substantial assistance to Chongqing? And in which one did one see the Anglo-American air force assisting the Chongqing army in resisting the Japanese army's attacks? Just like the Bougainville Island air and sea battle, the Anglo-Americans either skillfully avoid or retreat in the land and air battlefields!</p>
<p>The "Second Pearl Harbor" battle is still unfolding victoriously, but it has already established immortal achievements and determined the victorious future of the entire East Asian war situation. Its worthiness of universal admiration is beyond question. Today's question is how should the people in the rear of the Greater East Asia region repay the hard work of the soldiers on the front lines through their own efforts in their respective positions!</p>
<h3>Summoning the Chief of Naval General Staff: The Japanese Emperor Bestows an Imperial Rescript; Prime Minister Tojo Sends a Telegram Congratulating Commander Koga</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 11th: His Imperial Majesty the Emperor summoned the Chief of the Naval General Staff today and bestowed the following Imperial Rescript upon the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet: The Combined Fleet's carrier-based air force has fought bravely in the Solomon Sea battle, destroying the enemy fleet. I deeply commend them. However, the war situation in that area is still developing, and you should strive even harder to live up to My trust.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo sent the following congratulatory telegram on the 10th to Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet Koga and other related fleet commanders: Since the enemy troops landed on Mono Island, our army has won consecutive victories and achieved unprecedented great victories in the first and second air battles over Bougainville Island, which is truly commendable. Hereby, I sincerely express my gratitude to the naval forces for their good planning and brave fighting, and I pay my respects to the many heroic spirits who protect the country. Now, the entire nation is working together to enhance military strength, with the front and rear lines forming a united whole, and the determination to strive for final victory is becoming increasingly firm. Hereby, I wish you great success in this battle and pray for the continued good fortune of you and all the soldiers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Neutral countries have not denied, and the enemy countries have acknowledged, the accuracy of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of war results. The Asahi Shimbun here commented on this point, saying: Japanese soldiers are not merely lively by shouting military songs. Even students at the Naval Academy must undergo rigorous guidance in singing a military song to ensure accuracy. There is absolutely no concept of carelessness or falsehood in the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. Regarding the word "accuracy," general naval academy students receive thorough training. A difference of half a second can be the dividing point between whether a torpedo hits an enemy ship. Therefore, one must cultivate the spirit of paying attention to accuracy at all times. There is a world of difference between merely subjective accuracy and true (objective) accuracy. The above is the main reason why the Japanese Navy is not careless even when singing. The fact that the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcements possess unparalleled accuracy in the world is also not without reason. The so-called sunken enemy ships are limited to eyewitness accounts. When Japanese soldiers return to base after a battle, drivers and others hold a consultation similar to a confirmation battle. They first begin by investigating how many rounds hit the enemy ship, and then a majority of eyewitnesses report the enemy ship's sinking situation. After the two match, it is determined to be a sinking. If two torpedoes hit the enemy ship, it will mostly sink. If they do not witness the enemy ship sinking, they announce that it is heavily damaged. If there are reports of seeing the enemy ship tilting and shaking, they consider it lightly damaged. In the past, there have been repeated supplementary announcements of naval war results. This is because, when pilots who have not returned take photos of the enemy ship sinking upon returning to base, they confirm that enemy ships that were heavily or lightly damaged have been sunk. All of the above are sufficient to indicate the praiseworthy accuracy of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcements.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Collides with Enemy Ships: Demonstrates the Spirit of Self-Sacrifice; Lieutenant General Sato Ichiro Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The lofty spirit of Japanese aircraft colliding with enemy ships is truly admirable. This spirit is not caused by philosophy or ethics but is the spirit of self-sacrifice to fight to the end and strike the enemy for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor. Following Lieutenants Kiyomiya and Notomi, three company commanders also self-sacrificed in the second air battle over Bougainville Island. Lieutenant General Sato Ichiro of the Japanese Navy recently issued a statement on the spirit of commanders taking the lead in colliding with enemy aircraft, the gist of which is: It would be completely wrong for our citizens to think that soldiers treat their lives as light as a feather, are not afraid of death, and sacrifice themselves arbitrarily. Soldiers pay the most attention to their lives. How can they easily sacrifice themselves to serve His Imperial Majesty? If it is to repay the country, they will always go forward bravely and never shrink back. Self-sacrifice is the same. To consistently complete the task, self-sacrifice is the best means. I have already witnessed the Pearl Harbor attack, and American newspaper reporters reported: I personally saw the unique self-sacrifice of Japanese naval aircraft. Their skillful maneuvering, with aircraft already surrounded by flames, colliding with their targets is by no means a haphazard rush. It is truly a manifestation of fighting spirit. During the South Pacific naval battle last year, one of our reconnaissance aircraft once guided a naval air squadron sortie to attack the enemy fleet. The reconnaissance aircraft once returned to base but then resolutely turned its nose around and took the lead before the attack force departed. Although it knew that there was insufficient fuel and could not return again, it disregarded its own life and death because it realized that it was most difficult to discover the enemy fleet at sea and that a slightly delayed opportunity to discover it would mean losing the chance to attack. At all times, the commander of the reconnaissance aircraft had already decided to self-sacrifice. A certain officer who came from a preparatory student background had long had the ambition to self-sacrifice, and now he paid his courage with battle through self-sacrifice and never returned. Also, a certain petty officer was hit by enemy bullets and flew around a formation of friendly troops for a week, saying goodbye, and then flew to an enemy ship and self-sacrificed. Some make sudden decisions, and some have decided to self-sacrifice long ago. There is no textbook on "self-sacrifice" or books explaining the method of self-sacrifice. There are only the records left by predecessors. The self-sacrifice of Lieutenants Kiyomiya and Notomi and the three company commanders is "living teaching material." If the commander's aircraft takes the lead in colliding with enemy ships, there is no reason for subordinates to retreat. This is not a battle method taught by school instructors but is the result of following predecessors and combat research.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attacks Eastern India</h3>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi: Indian military authorities announced on the 10th that Japanese bombers bombed a British air force base near the eastern border of India on the 9th. The base suffered considerable damage, and there were casualties.</p>
<h3>US Navy Announces Loss of Three Destroyers</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Washington: After a long period of time, the US Navy announced yesterday the loss of three returned loan destroyers. The USS Henley and USS Saufley are the newest types. The former has a displacement of 1,500 tons and a speed of 40 miles per hour. It is equipped with four 12.7 cm guns and other light armaments, as well as sixteen torpedo tubes. It was built in 1936-37. The USS Saufley was also built during the war and belongs to the large destroyer class. It has a displacement of 2,100 tons and is equipped with eight 12.7 cm guns. This destroyer has very complete water supply equipment, but the official communique did not reveal it. The above two ships both sank in the waters near the Solomon Islands, but the third ship, the USS Boris (1,190 tons), sank in the Atlantic Ocean. It was built in 1918. This ship is less important, so it only sailed in the Atlantic Ocean. According to the Ottawa Agreement, the British are responsible for protecting the North Atlantic convoys, so the USS Boris must have sunk in the South Atlantic. The official report claims that the sinking was not due to enemy attacks, which is difficult to believe. It further states that crew members and sailors were sacrificed, which is contradictory, so there may be other reasons for its sinking.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Surprise Attack on Laohokou Airfield</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have joined forces to reverse the declining trend and are working hard to strengthen bases near peaceful areas, attempting to launch a counteroffensive against the Japanese army in China. The Japanese Air Force, aware of their intentions, launched a large-scale surprise attack on the enemy base at Laohokou Airfield (170 kilometers north of Yichang) with a large formation on the morning of the 10th, destroying and setting fire to three places of the airfield's taxiway military facilities and completely destroying an oil storage depot. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>

<p>Central China Japanese Army Frontline, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army overcame the small river area of the Dongting Lake area, pursuing the Chongqing 160th, 150th, and 162nd Divisions. After capturing their important hub, Hongmiao, on the 9th, the right-wing unit broke into Zhongfanggang, 40 kilometers from Qinjin City, on the 10th, and the main force also broke into Baiyangpu (6 kilometers northeast of Jinshi). The Japanese army, which had cooperated in capturing Anxiang along the way, urgently turned its sharp edge and advanced westward. The fall of Jinshi is imminent.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in Central China, a unit of the Japanese army, in coordination with the Japanese army in the area of Hekou, Xin Wei Temple, and Xiangzi Creek, forced the Chongqing Provisional 6th Division north of Nuanshui Street, and has advanced to the west of Chixi River (27 kilometers northwest of Nuanshui Street). On the evening of the 9th, the Chongqing Provisional 6th Division attempted a counterattack, but the Japanese army repelled them head-on and completely cut off their retreat, destroying their counterattack attempt everywhere. Japanese army aircraft also strafed and bombed the Chongqing army in that area on the night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th.</p>
<p>Hankou, November 11th (Central News Agency) – A large formation of Japanese bombers attacked Changyang (20 kilometers southwest of Yidu), the base of the Chongqing 13th Division, at 1:40 AM on the 10th, destroying military facilities in the area and bombing and strafing the Chongqing army of the 13th and 30th Divisions nearby. All aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army in Central China, the Japanese army air force has been very active in the Sixth War Zone of the Chongqing army recently, achieving considerable battle results. The following is a brief account of its activities: A large formation of Japanese aircraft, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army of the 79th Army, 194th Army, 98th Division, and Provisional 6th Division, etc., under Sun Shuzhong, which was being pursued by the Japanese army into Bashan, discovered the main force of the Chongqing army fleeing along the river in a certain area and immediately bombed it, making low-altitude flights and using machine guns to strafe it. The Japanese army's dive bomber squadron discovered the 86th Army and 10th Army of Wu Qiwu's Jiangfang Army, which were attempting to prevent the Japanese army's advance, in a mountain gorge in a certain area and bombed and strafed them before all aircraft returned safely.</p>

<p>Lisbon, November 11th (Central News Agency) – Former British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, warned the British in a speech at the Royal Empire Society in London yesterday that they should not underestimate the strength of the Japanese front lines along Burma, Malaya, and East India. The British Empire must devote all its efforts to the war.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, November 11th (Central News Agency) – The Anti-Axis Forces' attempt to counterattack Burma has had its momentum thwarted due to the Japanese army first launching an attack in Yunnan. The enemy forces on the Indian-Burmese border are currently holding their ground. The commander of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces, Lord Louis Mountbatten, has been in office for over a month, but the deployment and combat training of the new headquarters do not seem to be complete yet. According to a British news broadcast from Chongqing, the Anti-Axis Forces still have many problems to solve before they can begin their counterattack, and transportation difficulties are the biggest obstacle. The gist of the news is: The biggest difficulty in the plan to counterattack Burma is the smooth flow of the rear supply lines. These supply lines must cross overlapping mountains, treacherous rivers, and penetrate dense forests before they can be opened.</p>

<h3>National Father's Birthday Memorial Ceremony Held by Central Authorities; Mausoleum Opened for Public Viewing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – Today (the 12th) is the National Father's Birthday Memorial Day. On the occasion of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the unfulfilled aspirations of the National Father’s forty years of dedication to the National Revolution – the abolition of unequal treaties and the pursuit of China's freedom and equality – are now all realized. Its significance is undoubtedly great. To comfort the spirit of the National Father in heaven, the central authorities have specially decided to solemnly hold a grand ceremony in front of the National Father’s Mausoleum at 10:00 AM today to commemorate the realization of the National Father’s aspirations. Central political committee members and specialized committee members, civil and military officials above the rank of Jianren (appointed by the national government) from various ministries and departments under the National Government, central executive and supervisory committee members, and central party headquarters personnel above the rank of division chief will all reverently visit the National Father’s Mausoleum to pay their respects, to show their comfort, and to express their sincere respect. Civil officials will wear national dress or blue robes with black jackets and medals. Military officials will wear military uniforms, swords, and medals. The order of the memorial ceremony has been stipulated and promulgated as follows: music will be played; all will stand at attention; all memorial participants will take their positions; the national anthem will be sung; the highest respects will be paid to the National Father's portrait; the National Father’s testament will be respectfully read; flowers will be presented; the memorial address will be respectfully read; the remains will be viewed; and the ceremony will conclude with music. To commemorate the great spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs who fought for the country during the revolution and to express respect for the allied comrades who aided our country's revolutionary cause, the central authorities have also decided to hold a memorial ceremony at the Martyrs' Shrine of the National Revolution in the Zhenqi Hall of the Wuliang Hall after the memorial ceremony to the National Father. After the ceremony, they will proceed to the Guangming Hall of Linggu Temple to pay respects to the Japanese comrades who aided the Chinese revolution.

<h3>The Members of the Cotton Control Committee Have Been Internally Decided</h3>

The candidates for the members of the Cotton Control Committee have been largely decided internally. The Executive Yuan has decided to specially appoint Tang Shoumin as the Chairman concurrently, and the Vice Chairman is the Japanese Hishida Itsuji. There are a total of thirteen Chinese and Japanese members, who will be formally appointed by the National Government soon. In addition, the unified purchase price and purchase funds are being carefully negotiated. It is expected that the purchase work will be launched soon. Furthermore, the thirteen Chinese and Japanese members who have been internally decided held a joint meeting at the Central Reserve Bank in Shanghai a few days ago regarding the unified purchase of cotton. The list of the internally decided members of the Cotton Control Committee is recorded below: Chairman: Tang Shoumin; Vice Chairman: Hishida Itsuji, Tong Luqing; Members: From the Chinese side: Wen Yanting (Chairman of the Yarn Factory Association, Director of the Commerce and Trade Association), Tong Luqing (Vice Chairman of the Central China Cotton Control Association, Director of the Commerce and Trade Association), Jiang Shangda (Vice Chairman of the Yarn Merchant Association, Chairman of the Raw Cotton Committee, General Manager of Minfeng Yarn Factory, Director of the Commerce and Trade Association), Guo Shun (General Manager of Wing On Yarn Factory and Wing On Company, Supervisor of the Commerce and Trade Association), Chen Baochu, Tong Guofu.

<h3>German Troops on the Kiev Front Adopt Elastic Defense; Soviet Encirclement Plan Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: The fighting in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River is intensifying, with the Soviets expanding the gap in Kiev with heavy forces and launching continuous fierce attacks. The main principle of the German army's actions is still to preserve its strength and adopt an elastic strategy, and to prevent a breakthrough. Therefore, the German army withdrew from the Kiev-Korosten highway and the Mala Goroshki and other areas the day before yesterday in order to use useful mobile units to deal with the enemy forces advancing southwest of Kiev. When the enemy tank corps was making a wedge-shaped advance in the area the day before yesterday, it was counterattacked by the German army, which attacked its flanks, and cut off the connection between the enemy's vanguard and the villages that had been captured. A major tank battle is in progress.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: Both the German and Soviet command headquarters are reinforcing the Kiev area with troops. Fierce battles are in progress northwest, west, and southwest of the city. South of Kiev, the fighting is gradually moving further south. The Dnieper River bend south of Pereyaslav is now included in the Kiev battle zone. The Soviet army is attempting to weaken the German forces in the Kiev area, so it launched a new offensive westward and westward in the Dnieper River bend, but it was blocked by the German army. German military observers said that the fighting in the Kiev area will continue. In the opinion of the Germans, the Soviet army's plan to encircle the German army on a large scale cannot be realized. The original intention of the Soviet army was that one pincers of the Soviet army would move from Kiev, and another pincers would move from the northwest area of ​​Krivoy Rog further south. The German army realized the Soviet army's plot and withdrew its troops and counterattacked north of Krivoy Rog. This counterattack prevented the southern pincers from moving and caused its entire encirclement plan to fail. Since the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive on July 5, the Soviet army has never achieved the goal of encircling the German army in a pocket, while the German army has often been successful in previous operations. Regarding the future development of the war, the German army is able to prevent the Soviet army from sweeping through the front line, and the Soviet army's encirclement plan has completely failed.</p>
<h3>The White House Convenes Another Meeting of Military Leaders; A Prelude to the Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news, preparations for the meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin seem to be progressing. President Roosevelt recently held consultations with his military advisor General Marshall, Admiral Nimitz, and Navy Secretary Knox, among others. It is said that this move is a prelude to the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.</p>
<p>A Sketch of the Terrain of Crimea</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: The northern end of the Crimean Peninsula is now the site of the most intense fighting. There are three connections between the peninsula and the mainland, the most important of which is the Perekop Isthmus. The other two are the Arabat Spit, located on the Sea of ​​Azov, about one hundred kilometers long, extending near Genichesk, connecting the Kerch Peninsula with the southern Russian plains. Not far to the west, near Salvo, there is another isthmus about one kilometer wide, through which the railway to Melitopol passes. The Soviet army launched fierce attacks on these two narrow connections but failed, and now only artillery bombardment is being carried out. Between the isthmus near Salvo and the Perekop Isthmus, there is the so-called Sivash, also known as the Rotten Sea (Rottensen), with a water depth of only one to two meters, turbid like a quagmire, almost fordable, hence the name. After the Soviet army failed to attack the German lines near Perekop on November 1, it planned to cross the Rotten Sea to outflank the German army, but it also failed. Therefore, the center of the war has now shifted to the Perekop Isthmus.</p>
<h3>America's Rejection of East Asians</h3>
<p>— Ai Ming</p>
<p>A New Play in America</p>
<p>According to recent reports from Washington, the United States is staging another wonderful play to please Chongqing. That is to revise the famous immigration law that excludes Orientals, and exceptionally allow Chinese from Chongqing to enter the country. This is another means of Uncle Sam flattering Chiang Kai-shek. Among Americans, voices expressing dissatisfaction with the exclusion of Chinese have recently become louder. They seem to genuinely have this view. This immigration law, implemented in 1924, stipulates that all East Asian peoples are always treated as inferior races and do not receive the same treatment as European peoples. Do ordinary Americans clearly know this? Why should the Chinese and Japanese nations with long traditions and high cultures be regarded as inferior races and excluded? The United States refuses to treat the people of China, Japan, and other Asian countries the same as Europeans, Czechs, Slavs, Poles, Lithuanians, and other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Racial Prejudice</p>
<p>Racial prejudice is a major cause of international discord and a direct motive for war. The United States, which touts humanitarianism, deliberately insults the East Asian peoples, who have a strong sense of self-respect, by treating them as inferior races. The United States openly declares in this war that it is fighting to save these East Asian peoples. Isn't that a contradiction? American-style morality may allow this hypocrisy, but from an Eastern perspective, that is an absolutely impermissible contradiction. So what is the real motivation for excluding East Asian races? There is no real reason for the immigration problem. Because even if this exclusion law is not applied, the number of immigrants entering the country from China and Japan each year does not exceed one hundred. The reason for excluding East Asians naturally lies elsewhere. We can assert that it is simply from the standpoint of racial prejudice that East Asians are excluded for the sake of exclusion.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of this bad law and the continuation of the exclusion law, in recent years, it has greatly hindered the national relations between Japan and the United States. Americans, who are very clear about the issue of rights and obligations, have closed the doors of their country to East Asians, so East Asians naturally also have the right to close Americans out of East Asia. This point cannot be refuted by anyone.</p>
<p>The Motive for War</p>
<p>The motive for the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can really be attributed to the exclusion of Orientals by the British and Americans. Because the United States and other countries in the New World refused to allow Orientals to enter, as a result, East Asians had no other way to survive except to maintain their survival and development in their own territories, that is, within the East Asian region.</p>
<p>Let's look at the declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo on the 5th:</p>
<p>The Greater East Asian nations will jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asian nations will mutually respect their autonomy and independence, strive for mutual assistance and friendship, and establish the harmony of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asian nations will mutually respect their traditions, develop the creativity of each nation, and promote the harmony of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asian nations will closely cooperate on the basis of reciprocity to promote their economic development and enhance the prosperity of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asian nations will enhance friendship with neighboring countries, abolish racial discrimination, universally communicate culture, further open up resources, and contribute to the development of the world.</p>
<p>This declaration does not want to exclude Americans from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We only want to preserve the East Asian region for East Asians. Although it is already too late, the United States has also realized the unfairness of its exclusion law and is now trying to revise it. We are very interested in its developments and are watching closely. However, according to detailed reports from Washington, the United States does not want to completely revise this exclusion law, but only set an exception for Chinese from Chongqing. That is to say, it does not want to make any changes to the fundamental spirit of excluding East Asians.</p>
<p>In other words, the United States only wants to please Chongqing and use this important issue. Its purpose is not justice but interests. If the United States truly feels that it is wrong and wants to correct its past mistakes, why only abolish this restriction for Chinese from Chongqing?</p>
<p>Amendment Fails</p>
<p>What about the Japanese? Needless to say, Japan and the United States are at war. But this state and that restriction are another matter. Temporary phenomena cannot be confused with the eternal race issue. If Americans want to revise it in this spirit, then the failure of their amendment is obvious. It is already fortunate if it does not cause greater emotional division. I am afraid that Chongqing will never be satisfied with this! Other Greater East Asian nations will probably feel even greater dissatisfaction as a result. Combining these points, the justice and humanity advocated by the United States in this war are only verbal and absolutely unwilling to put them into practice. The one who disrupts world peace and wets the justice and humanity is actually the United States.</p>

<h3>The General Association of Commerce and Trade Announces Various Work Guidelines; Cloth Rationing Pending Government Approval and Implementation; Cotton Industry Management Office to be Established to Specialize in This Matter</h3>
<p>To ensure the outside world understands the General Association of Commerce and Trade's recent work, the association held a reception for reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers and news agencies in its conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Tang, on behalf of Secretary Yin, delivered a speech, hoping that people from all walks of life would support the association's work and answering the reporters' questions one by one.</p>
<p>Cloth Rationing Imminent</p>
<p>1.  (Question) When will the cloth rationing implementation method be put into practice? What are the general contents of the method? (Answer) The association has been ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, which will continue until March. This matter is extremely complicated, but fortunately, with the support of all parties, the purchase work has now been completed. As for the rationing method, it can be implemented as soon as the government approves and announces it. The allocation to various factories and shops can be handled in advance to meet the needs of production and the public.</p>
<p>Cotton Control Committee Chairman to Be Appointed</p>
<p>2.  (Question) News reports indicate that Chairman Tang has been appointed as the chairman of the Cotton Control Committee. What is the nature of this committee? Has the plan for the centralized purchase of cotton been decided? When will the committee be established? (Answer) The association has long begun planning for the purchase of new cotton. However, this work is arduous and requires a sound organization to handle it. Therefore, after consultations with various parties, the Cotton Control Committee was formed to specialize in cotton purchase. Wen Lantinger and his partner Qing have been recommended by the industry as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for Chairman Tang being the chairman, there has been no formal government order. Even if there is an order, Chairman Tang may not have time to take care of it and will decline, and industry representatives will still be in charge of execution. The chairman of the association will play a supervisory and guiding role.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Management Office to Be Established</p>
<p>3.  (Question) When will the Cotton Industry Management Office be established? What are the main functions of the office? (Answer) After the establishment of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, the responsible personnel and all staff were able to fulfill their responsibilities and complete this complicated business. The association believes that the control of cotton yarn and cloth will be very important in the future, so it has been decided to change the office to the Cotton Industry Management Office to specialize in this matter. The director and deputy director have been decided, and all staff will be transferred from the office. The management office is expected to be established around the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Rational Allocation of Controlled Materials</p>
<p>4.  (Question) Are there any regulations regarding the future guidelines for materials control? Can you briefly inform us? (Answer) The association will implement the established policies for the control of various materials, striving to achieve a rational allocation of essential commodities related to people's livelihoods. This work is not easy, and we hope that all relevant parties will fully cooperate. We also hope that gentlemen of the press, people from all walks of life, and all merchants and civilians will provide guidance on our administration, so that we can follow it. The association's business is closely related to everyone's life, and we hope that we can all work together to overcome the difficulties of this great era. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<p>Main Resolutions of the Board of Directors and Supervisors Meeting</p>
<p>5.  (Question) What was the situation of the ninth joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors held yesterday? (Answer) In addition to reporting on association affairs, four important resolutions were discussed: 1. Seventeen hemp merchants, including Zhuo Qing, were designated as initiators of the Hemp Industry Association and ordered to organize it as soon as possible. 2. The association established a soap and candle industry professional department to be responsible for handling soap and candle control matters. 3. It was decided that four joint associations, such as the grocery industry in various regions, would recommend representatives to apply for membership. 4. The reorganization of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office into the Cotton Industry Management Office was retroactively approved to handle all matters related to the unified management of cotton product allocation, production, and sales.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Rationing Dates Announced; Economic Office of the First District Receives Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Public Office, in order to clarify the purpose and methods of the authorities' handling of rationing of soap and matches, yesterday specially invited reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies to give a talk by Chen Riping, director of the Economic Office. He also mentioned the issue of suppressing commodity prices. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Investigation to Suppress Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Chen said that the authorities have already rationed daily necessities such as rice, flour, milk, and butter in the past, and are actively planning to ration soap and matches. Salt, coal briquettes, cooking oil, and industrial coal are also being considered for rationing soon. In addition to stepping up the rationing work, we will also begin to take further measures to suppress commodity prices. I believe that the most important method to suppress commodity prices is to strictly enforce the price limits set by the authorities. The Economic Office has re-evaluated the new price limits for manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The "Investigation and Enforcement Section" of the office will send personnel to conduct thorough investigations to see if the manufacturers are selling goods in accordance with the price limits set by the authorities. When the office sends personnel to investigate manufacturers, they will be in groups of three, and they will also conduct random checks on business accounts to eliminate hoarding. When investigators are performing their duties, they must show the "Economic Office Staff ID Card" issued by the office, which has a photo of the investigator. Otherwise, they can be refused. Investigators must be kind in their attitude when investigating factories. In addition, if investigators are suspicious or dishonest, they can be sent to the nearby police or reported to the Economic Office to prevent such unfortunate events from happening.</p>
<p>Regular Rationing of Soap and Matches</p>
<p>Chen continued to mention the functions of the Economic Group Management Section, which is in charge of the registration, supervision, and guidance of various industry associations in the city. The section holds at least one or two meetings every week to convene the business of various industry associations to conform to the wartime system. Therefore, the mission of each industry association itself, on the member side, is to adjust production and sales, and to set price limits, to benefit the wartime system and not to violate economic rules. All industry associations in the city that have already registered with the General Association of Commerce and Trade must also register with the office. Subsequently, the Economic Office also released news about the rationing of soap. The procedures for rationing soap are different from other items due to the large number of manufacturers and different products, which makes it quite difficult to plan. For example, if one manufacturer's products are rationed to every resident of the city, it is five-star soap. The Economic Office solemnly stated that the quantity of this rationed soap is slightly different, but its quality is flawless. Sales will begin on the 18th of this month. Soap coupons have been issued to all Chinese people except foreigners. At that time, they can be purchased at designated retail stores, limited to one bar per person per month. Matches will also be sold from the 16th of this month. Coupons have also been issued to Chinese people in the district, limited to one pack per person per month. The product is Golden Tripod Matches, and the standard for each box of matches is ninety sticks. The rationing price will be announced by the office in the form of a notice one day before implementation. It is said that the price is quite cheap.</p>
<p>Measures for Coal Briquettes and Sugar</p>
<p>Chen also answered reporters' questions and announced that the authorities were dealing with the soaring market prices of coal briquettes and sugar. The reason is that the supply is not smooth, but the main reason is hoarding by good merchants. The Economic Office is stepping up its efforts. It is still difficult to announce a specific date for the implementation of coal briquette rationing, but its price will be suppressed as much as possible after it is rationed one day. Sugar: There has been sugar procurement from the outside world recently. Now it has been filled to three provinces and two cities, so there is no shortage of sugar, and it can be distributed according to the original rationing amount. The rationing of food is handled by the "Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office." The rationing dates for October and November have been delayed, mainly due to discussions on the price issue. It should be possible to ration according to the original method in the future.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Ceremony for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Today; All Citizens to Hold a Moment of Silence</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Today is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday.

In addition, two large propaganda vehicles were used to distribute letters to the public on the roads of the city.</p>

<h3>Youth League of the Eighth District Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Youth League held an inauguration ceremony in Gujiazhai Park at 10:00 AM yesterday.

It is said that this move is to comply with the price of the Normal Bureau and to make up for the losses in rationing household sugar, so the price of household sugar can still be maintained.</p>
<h3>"Gone with the Wind" Performances Become More Exciting; Shen Min Plays Scarlett O'Hara; Yingzi Visits the Theater to Give a Report</h3>
<p>The famous drama "Gone with the Wind," performed by the Kugan Troupe at the Paris Grand Theater, has been performed for nearly a month, and the box office has always been booming. The four major male and female roles in the play have been changed recently, with Shi Hui replacing Bai Ruide, Bai also replacing Wei Xili, and Yang Yingwu replacing Mi Daifu. The lineup is new, and the performance is even more spectacular. The role of Scarlett O'Hara, which is the most important role in the play, was originally played by Lan Lan. Unfortunately, Miss Lan sprained her foot during the performance the night before. Shen Min, who was originally scheduled to play Scarlett O'Hara, also took the stage early yesterday. Xiao Bi's acting skills are well-trained, and she is particularly moving in the first three scenes of "Gone with the Wind," which is highly appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p>Yingzi, a member of the Kugan Troupe, has been resting in the hospital due to illness. Recently, her health has improved slightly, and she has decided to go to the Paris Grand Theater today to report on the work of the Kugan Troupe to the audience. According to the report, Kugan held a long-term charity performance for the newspaper's scholarship fund. All members of the troupe worked extremely hard. This time, Xiao Bi Yingzi's report can also be regarded as doing her best for the scholarship movement.</p>
<p>"The Gentleman on the Beam," which will be staged after "Gone with the Wind," is directed by Zuo Lin and has been actively rehearsing recently. Most of it has become very skilled. The scheduled performance period for "Gone with the Wind" is not much longer. Please book your seats as soon as possible if you have not seen the play and want to see it!</p>

<p>Economic Circle Reviews</p>
<h3>Contribution to the Economic Office of the First District</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the establishment of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special Municipality is undoubtedly how to prevent the occurrence of problems such as low productivity in terms of local food and necessities, uneven rationing, and unstable public sentiment. Therefore, we can't help but rejoice in the fact that the First District Qi Chu authorities have previously expressed how to strive for the universal rationing of daily necessities, the strict suppression of illegal transactions, and the thorough investigation of general business conditions, believing that it is an institution that benefits the city.</p>
<p>Now, the Economic Office of the First District has arranged the rationing of soap and matches, one of the daily necessities for the people's lives, and is about to sell it universally. Its hard work and careful arrangement to take care of the people's livelihoods in the area is self-evident. In addition to supporting the economic policies of the Economic Office of the First District, we would like to offer two sentences to the authorities of the Economic Office of the First District: "Prioritize the urgent and implement what is deemed necessary." The meaning of the first sentence is: For the most urgent sector of daily necessities—such as matches—prioritize the implementation of universal rationing. We believe that coal briquettes are essential fuel for residents, and the current serious situation is enough to make the general poor cut off cooking. This is what we consider to be a key point in the rationing problem. The meaning of the second sentence is: Whenever there are illegal price increases, especially when there is a perceived shortage of a certain material, it is advisable to act cheaply at any time and forcibly enforce the price limit. If it is found that there are those who deliberately violate this for their own private gain and profit, disregarding the future of the public's livelihood, then take decisive action. As the saying goes, "Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures."</p>
<h3>The General Association of Commerce and Trade Actively Promotes the Exchange of Materials Between the North and South; A Concrete Plan Will Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The General Association of Commerce and Trade is making unremitting efforts to communicate the materials between the North and South. Before the war, the exchange of materials between the two places was very smooth. Now, due to traffic obstructions, there are fewer materials transported to the North than to the South, which has a huge impact on the entire economy of the two places. Now, the General Association of Commerce and Trade is implementing this. The main materials transported to the North are flour and rice, etc., in exchange for oil, grain, coal, etc. from the North.</p>
<h3>The General Association of Commerce and Trade Establishes an Office in Jiujiang</h3>

The method of collecting this transit tax is 10% for China, with a minimum of 5%. The goods of Japanese merchants will be collected uniformly from November 10th.</p>
<h3>Enterprise News to Be Published Soon</h3>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of Enterprise News Agency is to study the origin of prosperity and development and the path of enterprise activities. The "Enterprise News Daily" will be published soon, with columns such as market situation analysis. The writers are all people from the Shanghai business and economic circles.

<h3>An Ideal Children's Paradise</h3>
<p>— Baimen</p>
<p>A Visit to the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute</p>
<p>On the picturesque Daxing Road, amidst the neat rows of street trees, the upper part of a four-story Western-style building is revealed, overflowing with captivating music. A moment later, the sound deepens, and the clamor of children playing ball is heard. Is it a wealthy person's villa or a noble school? Who would have thought that this place shelters a group of wild children who have been oppressed, abandoned, and hated!</p>
<p>Modern Ciyou Institute</p>
<p>The history of modern Chinese Ciyou (orphanage) undertakings is not very long, only a few decades in total. The first to organize relief and education for suffering children were religious groups from foreign countries who came to China. Only after they achieved success did Chinese people voluntarily start to organize such undertakings. Therefore, Ciyou undertakings in our country can be roughly divided into two main origins: 1. Ciyou undertakings organized by foreigners in China. These are the largest in scale, specialize in Ciyou work, and have achieved excellent results that have continued to this day, such as the Salesian Society, which is run by Italians. They now have institutions in Shanghai, Xuzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Kunming, Qujiang, and other places. 2. Ciyou undertakings organized by Chinese people. The first of these is the China Ciyou Association. This association also runs various relief and education programs for suffering children throughout the country. The Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute is one of the most important.</p>
<p>Ms. Yao Shuwen, the director of the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute, a kind and capable woman from northern China, said that the history of the institute also involved a period of arduous struggle. The association was originally founded in March of the 19th year of the Republic [1930] on Qiuhong Road in Shanghai. Soon after, the "January 28th Incident" [Shanghai Incident of 1932] broke out, and they moved to Yaozhu Road. After the situation stabilized, they moved again to Hongkou, first to Huishan Road and then to Tangshan Road, until the 25th year of the Republic [1936], when they finally settled at the current address - 1231 Daxing Road (formerly Rue Keyaude) in the Eighth District. In a way, it has the significance of Mencius's mother moving three times to find a good environment, because providing relief and education to suffering children requires careful selection of the environment!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute is a child welfare undertaking organized by the China Ciyou Association. The highest responsible persons are the standing directors Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Wu Weide. All practical work in the institute, such as teaching, training, and care, is under the leadership of Director Yao Shuwen. Teachers and staff members like Miss Zhang Xinqia are all graduates of advanced normal schools and are rich in social education experience. Each person must take on teaching and general institute affairs. There are no laborers, no nannies, and no special staff. Everything depends on these seven or eight people. They hardly have any free time each day, and they must also occasionally take care of the children at night. They must also regularly discuss and study the theory and practical methods of child welfare work, and because of insufficient funding, their lives are even more difficult than those of ordinary elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>It has been thirteen years and six months! They have written many moving and brilliant epics. They have taken in 894 suffering boys and girls, among whom some have already graduated or found</p>
<p>New Little Angels</p>
<p>On a certain Sunday, two teams of students were gathering in the schoolyard for a decent soccer game. A boy of about ten years old, with a whistle in his mouth, was quite the commander. Director Yao said with a smile, "He seems like a very excellent child! That's right, he's one of our excellent children here, but he has a rather unusual story." It turned out that this child was a pitiful soul who had lost his parents and a fairly well-off family in the Shanghai war. He was taken in by the institute. He still had an aunt who was living reasonably well, so because the institute had limited funds, they asked her to take him back. However, not long after, Director Yao saw a very thin street urchin with very dark eyes near a tram stop on some road, his head bowed, swiftly brushing past her, his weak little body almost falling to the ground. Upon closer inspection, wasn't he none other than Neng Binghua, whom she had rescued and taught for many days? Director Yao's tears couldn't help but gush out! She quickly approached him and, after asking, learned that his aunt had abandoned him elsewhere, and he had no choice but to beg on the streets. However, he was a person who had already received education and suffered particularly in his begging because he refused to steal or rob. Later, after an examination, fortunately, he had not been contaminated by bad habits at all. He resumed his bright work-study life in the institute. Because of his intelligence and good character, he has now completed elementary school and been admitted to Benbu Youth Middle School, becoming a young man with unlimited prospects. He still returns to the institute to live every day, considers the institute his home, and a certain person who is enthusiastic about charitable work has generously taken on the responsibility for his education.</p>
<p>The director excitedly recounted stories of children like these. If they were all recorded, they could almost be compiled into a thick collection of "Success Stories from Suffering"! "Look, in here, this little room is the dormitory of two other successful children of ours." Two military-style beds, and next to them, a children's desk with neatly arranged books. On the wall hang pictures of great men of national liberation and their own schedules, the writing as neat and beautiful as printed text. One of them, because it was Sunday, had returned to the dormitory to busy himself with something. He is none other than Wang Youpu, who had recently been admitted to Datong University Affiliated High School on a scholarship.</p>
<p>Like him, there are many others who have been successfully nurtured by the Shanghai Ciyou Training Institute and gone on to further education. The most outstanding are the female student Zhang Yuehua, now in her third year of junior high school at Jinling Girls' High School in Pudong; Wang Yueqing, in her first year at Minli Girls' Middle School. Among the male students, besides Xiong Binghua, who is at Qingnian Middle School, there is also one at Yuqun Middle School in the first year of junior high school. In addition, there are female students like You Bao and Xu Mei, and Ci Ying, who was admitted to the Shenbao scholarship, and the one who was admitted to the Xinwenbao scholarship, who are in the first year of junior high school at Xinben Girls' Middle School. The Ciyou Training Institute continues to shoulder the responsibilities of a parent for all these female middle school students.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Layman Wanghailou Donates Free Hospital Beds for Students</h3>
<p>Your organization's aid to students is something I deeply sympathize with, and I am ashamed that I have not donated due to my own meager resources. Today, I have discussed with the Foguang Sanatorium and obtained their consent. If any students suffering from typhoid fever or other illnesses are unable to afford medical treatment and need to be hospitalized for treatment, they may be admitted to the hospital with a written certificate from your organization and the permission of the hospital's doctor. There is a monthly limit of three people. All hospitalization and medical expenses will be borne by me. The hospital has Buddhist compassion and charges low fees for its wards. All those who are ill and wish to be treated at the hospital are welcome. Outpatient services and medication are provided in the morning. The hospital is located at 123 Masnan Road. Sincerely, Layman Wanghailou.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Chilblains</h3>
<p>Winter has arrived again, and many people will inevitably suffer from chilblains. Those who work outdoors and housewives will definitely feel uncomfortable when they get chilblains, and they will also waste a lot of unnecessary money. The weather is not yet very cold, so to avoid digging a well only when you are thirsty, here is a preventive method. That is, every night before going to bed, wipe your feet with cold water (preferably not hot water), then rub them with raw ginger. Then apply some Vaseline or similar ointment. Doing this can prevent chilblains from developing. Readers may wish to try it. (Cheng Qipeng)</p>
<h3>Epiphyllum Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Daguan Art Garden at 354 Jing'an Temple Road, founded by famous calligraphers and painters Zhang Zhongyuan and Jiang Hanting, has several pots of epiphyllum. The petals are currently in bud and are expected to open this afternoon (the 12th). It is said that they were obtained from a large monastery and are rare treasures in Shanghai. Those with a penchant for appreciating flowers should not miss the opportunity to be the first to see them.</p>
<h3>Responding to the Winter Clothing Donation</h3>
<p>Having read the article in your newspaper on the 9th about poor teachers requesting winter clothing, I was deeply moved. I am now sending savings certificates worth 500 yuan to help the poor teachers purchase winter clothing. I am well aware that this amount is very small, and I sincerely hope that benevolent gentlemen in the community will, with a heart of respect for teachers, donate according to their ability, so that small contributions can accumulate into a larger sum, allowing those who are teachers to stay warm, continue teaching, and thus be fortunate. Respectfully, Zhi Ji. (Note: The donation has been received and will be forwarded accordingly.)</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures Respond to Old-Age Assistance Funds</h3>
<p>— Mingde</p>
<p>The "Old-Age Assistance Fund" originally proceeded with the encouragement of the "Bao Fu Fa" [Preservation of Wealth Law], initially receiving one hundred yuan, but then stalled. Now that winter is approaching, with cold and hunger arriving together, and the four sufferings of old age, illness, and death all advancing, it is truly appropriate to loudly appeal for concern for the elderly, to address the various problems of illness, death, birth, and death, and to arouse the great aspirations of supporting the elderly, respecting the elderly, giving the elderly respite, and relieving the elderly, in order to conform to the sacred creation of "revering the elderly" in the Great Learning and inspiring filial piety among the people, to cultivate the people's hearts, to practice filial piety and brotherly love, and to demonstrate peace and prosperity, which is what we pray for. Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Juefo donated 50 yuan, Mr. Gao Hanqing donated 100 yuan, and Mr. Zhao Ximing donated 50 yuan, for a total of 200 yuan.</p>
