<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>論健康</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>—開放哈同花園之建議—</p>
<p>拿破崙初次看到歌德時，會發過一句感嘆的話：「Volia　un　homme（此處有人）！」道種贊嘆，也許是指歌德各方面而言的，但我認為是指其中能完成文化上那樣許多工作的歌德之偉大精力而言的。現在，我們從歌德的畫像上，也可以充分想像到，歌德是五官端正，而具有日爾曼民族的典型體格的。恐怕親眼看到他的人，只要看到他體格，也就實在够感覺到「此處有人」的了。同時，歌德對於拿破崙，也毫無疑問，會有同樣感覺的吧！歌德對於拿破崙，曾有如下的頌辭（見耶克爾曼著「歌德訪問記」）：</p>
<p>「一般人說：『拿破崙是花崗岩作成的人」，這句話也可以適用到他的身體上，他豈不是付麼事情都會作出來麼？他豈不是什麽事情都會勇敢地作過麽？從叙利亞的火熱沙漠，到莫斯科的酷寒雪地，其間不知有幾許進軍，會戰，和夜營！當時，不得不忍受如何的艱難困苦，以及肉體的不自由！短暫的睡眠與微少的進食，然而同時要作不斷的非常精神活動！十二月十八日（於是日，布律美爾（Brumaire）對拿破崙發動政變——吉田註），在極大的努力與騷擾中，到了半夜。他，終日未得進食一物。然而他仍不想使身體休息一下，在夜深時，曾感覺到只有起草吿法國人民書的有名宣言的力量。假如考慮到他所經歷的一切事情，一定會認爲他在四十歲時的身體，早已無一處可堪設想了。然而他在這個年齡，仍然佔着健壯的英雄地位」。歌德也好，拿破崙也好，凡是完成偉大事業的人物，都是受惠於絕頂健康的人，這決不是偶然的事。實例不必向歷史堆裏去求，在現在的大政治家中也可以看得到，如希特勒，史太林，墨索里尼等，凡是在其活着的期間內，完成國家改造的人們，全是受惠於絕頂的健康。</p>
<p>現在我們作一個想入非非的假定：設如此輩人物生於上海，縱然拿破崙以「花崗岩般的健康』生於此地，而像上海道樣不健康的環境，也會把他的健康糟塌得如土壤之脆弱吧！歌德在一八一四年，按我們東方的算法，是在六十六歲的時候，尚與有夫之婦媽麗安娜發生過戀愛，假如歌德生在上海，那末在六十六歲的時候，將不能和媽麗安娜講戀愛了，而將和陰間的鬼神談戀愛了。我們必須傷心地承認：在健康這一點上，我們東方人比起歐美人來說，是亳無矜誇的地方。柬方人無論在死亡率上說也好，無論在平均壽命上說也好，都遠不及歐美人。試觀下列數字：一九一二年的英國死亡率為十四點二，平均壽命男爲四十八歲點五十三，女爲五十二歲點三十八；荷蘭死亡率爲十三點八，平均壽命男為五十一歲，女為五十三歲點四十畫然而日本的死亡率為二十點八，平均壽命男為四十三歲點九十七，女為四十四歲點八十五；印度的死亡率為三十二點八，平均壽命男為二十二歲點五十九，女為二十三歲點三十一；中國的死亡率則處於日木與印度之間，平均壽命不過四十歲（摘自柯象峯著中國貧窮問題研究）。甚至估計中國人平均壽命為三十歲左右或二十二歲左右的人也有。（以下轉入第四版）</p>
<h3>波根維爾島南方　第三次海面空戰　日海軍機隊收獲極大戰果</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午四時發表：　帝國海軍航空部隊·十一日晝夜，惡劣天氣，在波根維爾島南方海陸攻擊敵機動部隊，收獲戰果如次：（甲）擊沉巡洋艦（或為大型驅逐艦）一艘，（乙）擊毀戰艦一艘（中創），大型航空母艦二艘（輕創），大型巡洋艦一艘（重創起火），巡洋艦（或為大型驅逐艦）三艘，（重創起火）、驅逐艦一艘（重創起火），（丙）擊落飛機二架，（丁）我方損失自炸及未返之飛機共三十架，（註此次空戰稱為第三次波根維爾島海面空戰）。　帝國海軍航空部隊及海上部隊，十一日迎擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機約二百架，當擊落其七十一架，此次戰鬥，我方損失有驅逐艦一艘沉沒，巡洋艦一艘受輕創，未返飛機十一架。</p>
<p>昭南十三日中央社電　日海軍機隊協力陸上部隊，述日對波根維爾島敵登陸地點之敵軍陣地，及於該島附近蠢動之敵艦艇反復加以轟炸。十一日夜，於待羅基那角海面攻擊敵運輪船團，共中一艘中彈起火沉沒。繼於十一日深夜轟炸摩諾鳥之敵陣地，予以極大損害。又將特羅基那角方面敵陸上陣地炸毀，繼再襲擊摩韋島，轟炸敵小型舟艇，炸燬其運輪挺一艘。自十日以來，日機襲擊敵方，共喪失飛機五架。</p>
<p>昭南十三日中央社電　日海軍機隊十一日襲擊挨利斯羣島之那路梅亞島，對該島敵機場滑行路設施投彈轟炸，有六處被炸起火，日機安返基地。</p>
<p>昭南十三日中央社電　十二日有敵B二十四型機十數架，編隊來襲泗水，經日軍防空部隊猛擊，遂倉皇遁表。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據墨爾缽來電，麥克沃塞將軍司令部之發言人，頃警吿謂：對美軍在波根維爾西區之戰績勿存奢望，因叢林作戰甚為困難，五百碼之前進，已被視為良好之成績。</p>
<h3>軍事專家談述　日美空戰意義</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據此間軍事專家談日·美空戰之意義稱：日·美兩國在所羅門海域所展開之決戰，日趨激烈，現日海軍部隊正在波根維爾島西方海面，由正面邀擊企圖賓行反攻之美海軍。溯自十一月一日於波根維爾島海面展開戰事以來，日·美雙方已有空戰四次之多，每次日軍均收獲驚人之戰果，然美軍之反攻意圖並未稍減，復動員有力之航空母艦或强力之艦隊，欲圖一氣攻陷南太平洋日軍作戰要點拉巴爾，故乃於第二次波根維爾島海面空戰後之第三日（十一月十一日），又發生第三次波根維爾島海面空戰，日軍復又收獲莫大戰果。按是役之規模頗大，美軍更會出動戰艦，巡洋艦及大型航空母艦，至此次美軍作戰之企圖，顯欲粉碎”軍在該方面之制空權，而攻入拉巴爾防綫。第三次波根維爾島海面空戰中，日軍擊毀美軍軍艦·航空母艦之數目，較以往為多，是投日方有飛機三十架自炸及未飛返原地，其原因　按日海軍機於接獲美軍出現之情報後，當即出動，於盡夜間二次攻擊美軍，其時該方面天氣遽變，忽降暴雨，咫尺莫辦，因此日海軍機隊喪失攻擊目標，迨至作戰，更恐困難。　此次作戰地點，較之前次距離為遠，但日海軍猶能克服此租惡劣條件，而收獲莫大戰果，實令人敬佩，且美軍遭數次慘敗後，必致力於防禦工作，是則海軍之犧牲亦屬當然者也。</p>
<h3>李報陳社長　前日下午抵東京</h3>
<p>本報社長陳彬　氏，出席大東亞新聞記者代表大會，偕同大陸新報社　　波多　氏於十二日下午五時零六分抵達東京，現下榻於帝國飯店。</p>
<h3>日駐保武官　談波島戰果</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　據保京電，索非亞。報訪員，曾於十二日訪問日駐索非亞公使館陸軍武官，叩以關於日本海軍航空部隊在波根維爾島海而所獲之大戰果一事，日陸軍武官當即發表談話謂：波根維爾島海面空戰之偉大勝利，實在戰略上予企圖反攻東亞之美軍以莫大打擊，蓋美軍企圖占領波根維爾島，乃集中　大兵力於該方面，但為日海軍機隊所察悉，常即急　美軍船團，而收獲偉大戰果，美軍已在此次戰鬥中獲得莫大之敎訓。同時足以證明日軍在東亞全域防衛之堅强，及日軍總反擊之力量，尤使吾人注意者，是役日軍損害極微，反之，美軍之損害較珍珠灣之役則猶大。</p>
<h3>爪哇中參院　主席等訪日</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　爪哇中央參議院主席斯加爾諾，議員哈達哈台來斯英等一行，為訪日本致謝日本允許爪吐民衆麥攻起見，已於十三日十五時四十分乘飛機抵此間，下機後赴帝國飯店休息，據斯加爾諾氏語記者稱：余久欲訪問日本，苦無機會，此次因承軍政監部之接助得償宿願，殊為感謝，當飛日本上空時，沿途見各大都市烟突林立，可見日本工業之發達，又余於中途獲悉日軍在波根維爾島方面收獲英大戰果，實令人驚異。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　爪哇自脫離荷蘭之桎梏而得解放，在日軍政指導之下新生以來，已經一年零九閱月，今全島五千萬原住民，為貫澈大東亞戰爭之眞義，刻正結集總力，協力日軍，以完遂戰爭。原住民為感謝日當局予以參政，曾於十月十五日起一連五日，在爪加爾達舉行第一次中央參議院會議，日軍最高指揮官，曾對該議會提出關於現住民協力實踐大東亞戰爭方策之諮問四項，參政會議對該諮問答覆如次：　設立防衛擁護團，並强化其組微。　設立提供勞動力機關。　關於强化戰時生活態勢之諸方策。　關於戰時增强生產之緒方策等，並將各地編組鄉土防衛義勇軍，及在後方創立防衛戰土援助會，援助義勇志願兵及其遺族。</p>
<h3>田尻公使　抵達北京</h3>
<p>北京十三日中央社電　日駐滬田尻公使因公於十二日下午抵此，於十三日上午訪問日駐北京　澤公使等，有所懇談。</p>
<h3>衛生行政會議明在京揭幕各省市代表陸續抵京</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　第一次全國衛生行政會議，已定於明日（十五日）在南京中日文化協會揭幕。衛生署收到各方提案已達八十餘件，祕書處及各組審委會工作極為緊張。截止昨日（十三日）止，各地代表已到京者，有上海市衛生局長李矩範，上海南市衛生事務所所長　海廣，北平市衛生局局長張惺庵，河北省公署代表賀間初，湖北省政府代表夏應中，靑島市公署代表張琛光，趙天中，江西省府代表周筱瀛，天津市衛生局局長李允恪，山東省公署代表孫季春，濟南市公署代表石湖蒲，安徽衛生事務所所長何拽，天津傳染病院院長侯扶桑等多人。其未來京之南北醫學專家，定今日抵京。</p>
<h3>阿部氏　談來華革命</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　日本文學報國會派遣來華之名作家阿部知二氏，自於十一日抵京以來，隨即下榻首都飯店。預定於日內與本京各文學家舉行種種懇談，互相交換意見，並作文學演講。所負使命，極為重大。記者特於昨（十三日）下午往訪阿部氏，承對記者所詢發表解答如下：「鄙人來京尚係初次，此番奉命來華，負扣介紹日本文化至巾國，且欲將戰後中國文化，對日本國內作正確之報道。並決於可能範圍內，儘量與中國作家懇談，德求得中日文化澈底交流。鄙人曾於去年從軍南洋一带，專事各項報道。南方區域雖有英美勢力把持，但其居民中十有三四，均為華僑，因此深感欲建設大東亞共榮圈，必與中國澈底深得文化溝通不可。上月三十日，中日締結同盟條約，本月又有大東亞共同宣當發表，中日兩國關係，因此又進一步。此次來華，途經北平，是處日語教育之普及，殊為驚人。北京大學北京師範多採用日語敎材，多數文學家如周作人氏等，均能應用極流暢之日本語，閱讀源氏物語等古典原文讀本。同時日木文學家亦多有學習中國文學者，其中所具有之意義，非常重大。欲求兩國間之永久協力，必先從風俗習慣文學等着手。凡此種種，除溝通文化外，別無可求之道，而溝通文化，必先相互瞭解不可。因此建設大東亞第三次文學者大會，定期在京舉行，首為我人贊同其理由亦在此。南京為中國首都，上海為唯一大域，鄙人均將一一與兩地文學界先進，及資年學生等，赤誠交換意見，共同努力，向建設大東亞文化之途邁進。</p>

<h3>石井參事官　調任要職</h3>
<p>南京中央社電　日本駐華大使館石井參事官，兼經濟部長，近奉國內命令，調任日本新瀉縣財務長局，現以任期在即，於今日下午四時，乘車赴滬轉道返日。</p>
<h3>大東亞會議　意義極重大　天羽總裁特予以闡明</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據名古　電話，日天羽情報局總裁，為出席十二日于大阪府召開之情報委員會，已於十二日搭車西下，氏于車中就此次大東亞會議之意義談稱：此次于東京舉行之大東亞會議，適為大東亞民族為完途戰爭急需强力團結之時，故其意義極為重大，尤于會議中通過之大東亞共同宣言，不僅為建設大東亞之綱要，且為表示世界和平之最高目標，故實乃世界史中之輝煌金字塔。各代表囘歸本國後，當可將此偉大宣言之內容，滲透于國內，努力使之具體化，本月十七日，將于東京舉行之大東亞新聞記者大會，即為協議滲透方針之一大推進力。</p>

<p>安加拉十三日中央社電　據海通社訊：路透社開羅息，德軍於星期五進攻杜特坎尼斯之電羅斯島，在該島獲得立足點一處，其他情形未詳。</p>
<p>安加拉十二日中央社電　據開羅公布：德軍今晨進攻杜特坎尼斯羣島之雷羅斯島，在數點已獲得立足點。該島係在羣島之極北方面，九月二十一日被英軍與哥斯及西姆斯島一同佔領，在十月中德傘兵三萬二千人在哥斯島降落，於是戰事繼續相常時期，在三星期後，反軸心司令部宣布謂：英軍已自該處撤退。</p>

<h3>華南日軍發動　廣九路戰事　報道部長闡明作戰意義</h3>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　日華南派遺軍·十三日就日軍已於廣州香港地區間，開始討伐作戰事發表稱：華南日軍與香港總督部緊密協力下，已於十一日平明對盤據於廣九鐵路沿綫一帶之渝軍及共軍保與香港防衛隊之連絡，展開澈底肅淸戰‘此次作戰之目的，係爲剷除擾　廣九鐵路沿綫一帶治安之禍根，擴大治安　　圍，俾謀香港及華南方面之飛　發展。</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　日華南派遣軍報道部長，於十二日曾就粤港間新作戰之意義與目的，發表談話，謂日華南派遣軍根據大東亞共同宣言，及中日同盟條約之理念，在與日軍防衛部隊緊密協力之下，於十一日拂　開始發觔廣九鐵道沿綫肅淸戰。此爲作戰之目的，在肅淸廣九鐵道渝軍抓大强化和平地區治安，俾確保港粵之關係，以謀發展華南方面之政治經濟文化各部門，促進廣東及香港之繁榮。對於附近一般民衆之生活，亦可予以甚大之便宜與幸福。當此大東亞決戰之時，日軍尤能謀民生之繁榮，此實足證明日本國力之強大。同時可以了解日軍此舉，乃係根據大東亞共同宣言，及中日同盟條約之理念，出於道義的誠意而行者，以協力中國之發展。今日之重慶已成為潰美之狂狗，不察東亞新情勢，高喊盲目抗戰。但大東亞共榮圈建設之進展，並不因重慶之抗戰而有妨礙。重慶陷中國於被滅之途，阻東亞之團結，實爲中國之罪人，東亞之叛徒。</p>

<p>星期評論　（自第一版轉來）　　　　關於東方人的體格，遠比歐美人的體格爲小，這一點是用不着拿數字來證明，而就會知道的吧！因爲上海有許多活着的實例，可供參考。尤其是日木人的身材矮小，這決不是東方人可以　矜的地方。在日本，曾有過一個稱作「鹿嗚館」時代的崇拜歐美時代，當時會發生過不倫不類的謬論：認爲想改良日本人的體格，則須獎勵人民與歐美人配偶。但後來，日本提倡國民體育，而現在日本人的平均身長，比較往昔高出一寸餘。當然，尙速不及歐美人的身長。至於中國人體格的脆弱程度，尤其是中國城市婦女的病態體格，眞是非筆墨所能形容。所謂「楊柳細腰」，也許只能常男子的玩物，但決不能常担負建設中華民國神聖任務之健康子女的母親。當然，這樣母親所生的兒女中，會有很多結核病患者的。民國二十三年六月八日，時事新報上曾發表過當時的上海市敎育局長潘公展的下列話：「根據正確的統計，世界上死於結核病者，十萬人中，新西蘭有一人，埃及有七十二人，德國有八十六人，英國有一百零三人，西班牙有一百三十六人，意大利有一百八十八人，日本有一百八十六人，中國竟達三百零七人。而全中國的息者數目，爲一千六百萬人，即平均二十五個人之中，即有一個患者」。這樣的世界第一，決不能充我們東方人向歐美誇耀的資料。　　盛行於東方人中的整個不健康現象的原因，究竟是什麼？有的人歸罪於東方人的固有體質，有的人歸罪於居室，食物，習慣等等，有的人說是缺乏衛生思想所致。當然，此處所列舉的因素，也都各自担負着一部份責任。然而最大的原因，却不能不說是在於政治關係上，如全部亞洲以前始終在英美的鐵蹄蹂躪下，而未臻於解放的近代國家之境·假如阻攙亞洲邁向近代化的政治關係，一旦剷除，而柬方人的居室，食物，習慣等，也加以合理的改善，那末東方人的健康狀態，定會一改舊觀，而煥然以一副新的姿態出現的吧！生於日木的近代大文豪德富蘆花，在共「回憶錄」中，所描寫的身材短小的少年淺井，常對別人說：「因爲我的兩肩上担負着藩閥政府，所以這樣矮小」·如把東方人兩肩上的英美帝國主義之重壓擺脫，則對東方人的健康上設，的確不是一件無意義的事。　　在上海的英美帝國主義壓迫，業已剷除了。那末，這將給上海人的健康以怎樣的好影響呢？不幸得很！在這一方面，一直到現在不僅仍然尙未看見有如何的改良，而且本市稠密的人口，因物價空前驚人的高漲，反致市民的健康愈形惡化。中日雙方當局，不要藉口現在爲戰事時期，而就逃避這一問題的解決。正因爲現在是戰事時期，才應當特別重視市民的健康問題。尤其在這個時期，爲了提高市民的健康水平，而開放前此英美帝國主義獨夫所御用的各種運動機關，以證實英美國主義消滅，即直接賜與東方人以無限　福利，這也是一件無與倫比的設施吧！關於這一點，我有一個私人建議。原爲英藉猶太財閥一人御用的哈同花園，現在既爲日本軍管理，那末中日雙方當局，何妨斟酌情形，對全體上海市民開放呢？果能如此？則居住於上海人口最稠密地方的市民大衆之健康，定將因此而大加促進。現在居住於上海人口最稠密的地方；如南京路，四馬路等等的人們，其附近並無適當公園，且對這批人到外灘公園，兆豐公園，法國公園去，距離太遠，又何况現在的交通工具情形，仍處在幾乎不能利用的狀態下呢！哈同公園假如開放，則居住於這一地段的人們，將如何五體投地感激中日雙方當局呵！　　我關心居住於上海人口最稠密地帶的人們之健康，而特別爲此事請命，並非毫無理由的。關於人口稠密對人類有如何的害處，有一個饒具興味的實例。按一九二九年，美國地德羅（Detroit）市的調查：城內人口最稠密的三區，嬰兒死亡率爲一千人中有八十六人，但其中人口比較最少的一區，則每一千人只有五十八人。此外最稠密的一區內，結核死亡率，則每十萬人中，平均有一百二十八人，而比較最不稠密的一區，則不過五十二人。這是美國地德羅市的情形，然而回頭看看人口密度遠超過該市的上海市，尤其是南京路，四馬路，五馬路一帶，人民的不健康情形究竟怎樣呢？聯想至此，馬上就可以瞭解：給這些人開放幅原廣大的哈同公園，是如何迫切而必要啊！　　業巳締結中日同盟條約的今天，爲了上海市民的健康，而請求中日雙方當局協助，也許我這樣的建議，似乎太渺小，但這樣渺小的實際問題，如能實事求是，按步就班地資行下去，這才能發揮同盟條約的眞諦。因此，我在道個偉大的時代，謹提出這個渺小的要求。（漢譯）社會服務四齡小孩患　不治的水頭症　　籲請中西名醫徹底研究　　敝友之子現在責足年齡巳四歲，患有不治之所謂「水頭症」之奇疾，迄今足有二年了。常孩子在襁褓時，面目淸秀，胖滿可愛，及能自行學步亦無絲廷病象。詎知在二歲時飲食開始有嘔吐，數日後嘔吐停止，初不加經意繼則頭部漸漸膨大，在六個月中逐步嚴重，現腦部之大勝於常人，致頭重脚輕舉步不穩，行輒跌仆，後遂不能舉步，即延醫診治，紹醫囑須朋Deetomin及Calipot兩種西藥補品，使其身體發胖與頭部雜持均衡，經連服多時終未生效。　　旋病勢由慢緩而轉劇，始自今年二月中旬送至紅十字會醫院，由醫生診斷係患「水頭症」，經施行手衛將頭部貯水吸出，則腦部略見縮小，餘外未見有何起色。可是不多時，頭部內的水復又增加，經數次手術施行後，仍然一如故，住院一個多月，並無轉機之象。　　據院中醫生說須施行大手衛方克有濟，因其身體過於虛弱，不能實施。遂離院以及停止診治巳八個月了，終日昏睡末　，祇得付諸天命，雙目也已失明。觀其烏珠似無變化，是否由腦神經綫折斷，而使眼球失光。為了久睡而腿部細瘦如榨，下半身成瘋癱不能活動。最近嘴　皮呈乾燥，晚睡口中時有淡色血水流出，牙齒亦現黑色，各指頭上隆起小塊贅肉，雙手略可活動，惟食時須大人餵給。胃口蠻好，每　可食一碗半飯。因牙無勁。以致不經阻嚼即行吞下。佐　之菜要備好的才吃，惟隔了二星期，就耍發生一次嘔吐，頭的腫脹處，如以手指輕擊作皮皷聲，如此以往孩子固受適疾桎梏之痛苦，累及其祖父母及父母，晚則寤寐不安，日則含淚相顧，處此慘境，誠可憫極矣。查醫學上旣有「水頭症」之名，社會上患者定不止敝友之子，特此籲請社會名醫，澈底加以研究，解去病者之枷鎖，卽造福人羣，功德無量也。虞頌堯啓。（通訉處海寗路五一四弄四四號）福利處舉行　職業座談會　　第一區公署社會福利處職業介紹科，定於明日下午三時在該公署大樓舉行「職業介紹座談會」，柬請本市金融工商職業敎育與新聞各界人士出席就有關職業介紹之各項問題，交　意見：　如何推進職業介紹工作，以謀失業者易於獲得職業？　如何使適宜之人材，任適宜之工作，俾能人盡其才，才盡其用？　保證制度與信用保證。按職業介紹科自成立以還先後前往登記求職者，截至上月底止，共三三〇八人，其中普通人材一九四六人，專門技術人材者三〇二人，在考慮中者一四八人，自覺職位不合引退者一九二人。又登記求人機關共四一一家，計普通人材登記來職者，概須經該科測騐後方能介紹云。為寒衣呼籲　　海上多慷慨俠義之士，每能扶危濟難，樂善好施，茲弟以困於時世，萬不獲巳，開誠呼籲，翼獲相助。弟幼失怙恃，又無兄弟，在滬依叔長成，束　受　，賦性誠實、歷任商界記室，機關及大學職員，報館記者。二十年來以從事於文化事業為多，薪水　級淡泊自甘，不料世事滄桑，近年生活程度之高，迫人實甚，弟素無恒產，一家六口，慘不堪言，去年家叔憂勞病故，弟失業甚久，旋任法院錄事，月薪不滿二百，今春任轉某交通機關文書員以來，月薪僅三八四元。迨至十月，始增至六六零元，以目下物價之昂，一家六口賴以微薪為活，淒慘情況，筆難盡述，三兒一女，均在髫齡，待哺嗷嗷，朝不保夕，而物價尙續漲不已，人情乃僥薄日甚。巧婦難爲無米之炊，闔冢時有在陳之嘆，艱危支揮典質一空，顧現在冬令已屆，寒衣待用，奈糧金猶難維持，衣服何從取　，竊念一家六口，衣食堪虞，僅有之舊敝衣服並將爲生活所犧牲，不僅無以一禦寒，抑亦碍及應世，凍餒交迫危急可想，敬祈各界仁慈之士，本人類互助之義，予以援助，俾度難關，得有生機，感且不朽。李慶多謹啓（通訊處水報社會服務盧轉）　　　領薪貼　同仁互助曾十一月份學生津貼已發到，接獲通知後，請即來具領勿延。</p>

<h3>On Health</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>—Suggestion to Open the Hardoon Garden—</p>
<p>When Napoleon first saw Goethe, he exclaimed, "Volia un homme (Here is a man)!" This kind of admiration may have been directed at Goethe in all aspects, but I think it refers to the great energy of Goethe, who could complete so much cultural work. Now, from Goethe's portrait, we can fully imagine that Goethe had regular features and a typical Germanic physique. Perhaps those who saw him in person, just by seeing his physique, could really feel "Here is a man." At the same time, Goethe undoubtedly had the same feeling towards Napoleon! Goethe had the following eulogy for Napoleon (see Jekelmann's "Goethe's Visit"):</p>
<p>"People generally say, 'Napoleon is made of granite.' This saying can also be applied to his body. Isn't there anything he can't do? Isn't there anything he wouldn't bravely do? From the scorching deserts of Syria to the freezing snows of Moscow, how many marches, battles, and night camps were there! At that time, how much hardship and physical restraint had to be endured! Short sleep and little food, yet at the same time, constant and extraordinary mental activity! On December 18th (on this day, Brumaire launched a coup against Napoleon - Yoshida's note), after great effort and disturbance, it was midnight. He had not eaten a single thing all day. Yet he still did not want to rest his body, and late at night, he felt the strength only to draft the famous declaration to the French people. If you consider everything he had experienced, you would think that his body at forty years old would have been unimaginable. Yet at this age, he still occupied the position of a robust hero." Whether it is Goethe or Napoleon, all those who accomplish great things are blessed with excellent health, and this is by no means accidental. There is no need to seek examples in the heaps of history; they can be seen in today's great statesmen, such as Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, etc. All those who have completed the transformation of their countries during their lifetimes have been blessed with excellent health.</p>
<p>Now let's make a fanciful assumption: Suppose such people were born in Shanghai. Even if Napoleon was born here with "granite-like health," an unhealthy environment like Shanghai's would ruin his health as fragile as soil! Goethe, in 1814, according to our Eastern reckoning, was sixty-six years old and still had an affair with the married woman Mariana. If Goethe had been born in Shanghai, then at sixty-six years old, he would not have been talking about love with Mariana, but talking about love with ghosts and gods in the underworld. We must sadly admit that in terms of health, we Easterners have nothing to boast about compared to Europeans and Americans. Whether it is in terms of mortality rate or average lifespan, Easterners are far inferior to Europeans and Americans. Consider the following figures: In 1912, the British mortality rate was 14.2, and the average lifespan for men was 48.53 years and for women 52.38 years; the Dutch mortality rate was 13.8, and the average lifespan for men was 51 years and for women 53.40 years. However, the Japanese mortality rate was 20.8, and the average lifespan for men was 43.97 years and for women 44.85 years; the Indian mortality rate was 32.8, and the average lifespan for men was 22.59 years and for women 23.31 years; the Chinese mortality rate was between Japan and India, and the average lifespan was only 40 years (extracted from Ke Xiangfeng's "Research on China's Poverty Problem"). Some even estimate that the average lifespan of Chinese people is around 30 years or 22 years. (The following turns to the fourth edition)</p>
<h3>South of Bougainville Island Third Naval Air Battle Japanese Navy Air Force Reaps Great War Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 13th: The Imperial Navy Air Force, day and night on the 11th, in adverse weather, attacked the enemy mobile forces on the sea and land south of Bougainville Island, reaping the following war results: (A) Sinking one cruiser (or large destroyer), (B) Destroying one battleship (moderately damaged), two large aircraft carriers (lightly damaged), one large cruiser (heavily damaged and on fire), three cruisers (or large destroyers) (heavily damaged and on fire), and one destroyer (heavily damaged and on fire), (C) Shooting down two aircraft, (D) Our side's losses were 30 aircraft self-destructed or not returned. (Note: This air battle is called the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island). The Imperial Navy Air Force and Naval Forces, on the 11th, intercepted about 200 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 71 of them. In this battle, our side lost one destroyer sunk, one cruiser lightly damaged, and 11 aircraft not returned.</p>
<p>Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Navy Air Force, in cooperation with the ground forces, repeatedly bombed the enemy positions at the enemy landing points on Bougainville Island and the enemy ships moving around the island. On the night of the 11th, they attacked an enemy transport convoy off Cape Torokina, setting one ship on fire and sinking it. They then bombed the enemy positions on Mono Island late on the 11th, inflicting great damage. They also destroyed the enemy land positions on Cape Torokina and then attacked Mowe Island, bombing enemy small boats and destroying one of their transports. Since the 10th, the Japanese aircraft attacking the enemy have lost a total of five aircraft.</p>
<p>Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese Navy Air Force attacked Nauru Island in the Ellice Islands on the 11th, bombing the enemy airfield runway facilities on the island, setting fire to six places. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Shonan, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram On the 12th, a squadron of more than ten enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Surabaya, but were fiercely attacked by the Japanese air defense forces and fled in panic.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a Melbourne dispatch, a spokesman for General MacArthur's headquarters recently warned that no extravagant hopes should be placed on the US military's war results in the western region of Bougainville because jungle warfare is very difficult, and an advance of 500 yards is considered a good result.</p>
<h3>Military Experts Discuss The Significance of the Japan-US Air Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to military experts here, the significance of the Japan-US air battle is: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Solomon Sea is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, the Japanese naval forces are on the sea west of Bougainville Island, intercepting the US Navy attempting to launch a counterattack head-on. Since the start of the war on the sea off Bougainville Island on November 1st, there have been as many as four air battles between Japan and the United States. Each time, the Japanese army has reaped amazing war results, but the US military's intention to counterattack has not diminished. They have mobilized powerful aircraft carriers or strong fleets in an attempt to capture Rabaul, a key Japanese operational point in the South Pacific, in one fell swoop. Therefore, on the third day after the Second Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island (November 11th), the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island occurred, and the Japanese army once again reaped great war results. According to the scale of this battle, the US military even dispatched battleships, cruisers, and large aircraft carriers. The US military's operational intention this time was obviously to smash the "Japanese" military's air control in that area and attack the Rabaul defense line. In the Third Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island, the number of US warships and aircraft carriers destroyed by the Japanese army was greater than in the past. The reason why 30 Japanese aircraft self-destructed and did not return to their original positions was that after the Japanese naval aircraft received information about the appearance of the US military, they immediately took off and attacked the US military twice all night. At that time, the weather in that area suddenly changed, and heavy rain fell suddenly, making it difficult to see even a short distance. Therefore, the Japanese naval aircraft lost their attack targets, and it was even more difficult to operate during the battle. The location of this operation was farther than the previous one, but the Japanese Navy was still able to overcome these harsh conditions and reap great war results, which is truly admirable. Moreover, after suffering several disastrous defeats, the US military will inevitably focus on defense, so the sacrifice of the Navy is also a matter of course.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Stationed in Bulgaria Discusses War Results on Bougainville Island</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram According to a Sofia dispatch, a reporter from the Sofia newspaper interviewed the Japanese military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Sofia on the 12th regarding the great war results achieved by the Japanese naval air force in the sea off Bougainville Island. The Japanese military attaché immediately issued a statement saying: The great victory in the naval air battle off Bougainville Island has dealt a great blow to the US military's strategic attempt to counterattack East Asia. The US military's attempt to occupy Bougainville Island was to concentrate a large force in that area, but it was detected by the Japanese naval air force, which immediately attacked the US convoy and reaped great war results. The US military has gained a great lesson in this battle. At the same time, it is enough to prove the strength of the Japanese army's defense in the entire East Asia region and the power of the Japanese army's general counterattack. What is particularly noteworthy is that the Japanese army's damage in this battle was extremely small. Conversely, the US military's damage was even greater than in the Pearl Harbor attack.</p>

This time, I am very grateful to have the assistance of the military government to fulfill my long-cherished wish. When flying over Japan, I saw many chimneys in the major cities, which shows the development of Japanese industry. I also learned on the way that the Japanese army had reaped great war results in the Bougainville Island area, which is truly amazing."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram It has been one year and nine months since Java broke free from the shackles of the Netherlands and was liberated.

<h3>Mr. Abe Discusses the Revolution in China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram Mr. Abe Tomoji, a famous writer dispatched to China by the Japan Literature Patriotic Association, has been staying at the Capital Hotel since arriving in Beijing on the 11th. He is scheduled to hold various talks with writers in Beijing in the coming days to exchange views and give literary lectures. His mission is extremely important. The reporter specially visited Mr. Abe yesterday (the 13th) afternoon and received the following answers to the reporter's inquiries: "This is my first time in Beijing. I have been ordered to come to China to introduce Japanese culture to China and to report accurately on Chinese culture after the war to Japan. I am determined to talk with Chinese writers as much as possible within the scope of my ability in order to seek a thorough exchange of culture between China and Japan. I served in the Nanyang area last year, specializing in various reports. Although the southern region is controlled by British and American forces, three or four out of ten of its residents are overseas Chinese. Therefore, I deeply feel that in order to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to thoroughly and deeply communicate with China culturally. On the 30th of last month, China and Japan concluded a treaty of alliance, and this month, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which furthered the relationship between China and Japan. On this visit to China, I passed through Beiping, where the popularity of Japanese language education is amazing. Peking University and Beijing Normal University mostly use Japanese language teaching materials. Most literary figures, such as Mr. Zhou Zuoren, can use fluent Japanese to read classical original texts such as The Tale of Genji. At the same time, many Japanese literary figures are also learning Chinese literature, which is of great significance. To seek permanent cooperation between the two countries, it is necessary to start with customs, literature, etc. All of these can only be achieved by communicating culture, and to communicate culture, it is necessary to understand each other first. Therefore, the reason why we agree with the construction of the Third Greater East Asia Writers Conference to be held in Beijing is also here. Nanjing is the capital of China, and Shanghai is the only large area. I will exchange views sincerely with the advanced figures in the literary circles of both places and the students who have been in school for many years, and work together to move towards the path of building Greater East Asia culture.</p>

In the car, he spoke about the significance of this Greater East Asia Conference, saying: The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo this time is precisely when the Greater East Asia nations urgently need to unite strongly to complete the war, so its significance is extremely important. Especially the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed at the conference is not only the outline for the construction of Greater East Asia, but also the highest goal for expressing world peace, so it is truly a brilliant pyramid in world history. After the representatives return to their countries, they should be able to infiltrate the content of this great declaration into their countries and strive to make it concrete. The Greater East Asia Newspaper Reporters Conference to be held in Tokyo on the 17th of this month will be a major driving force for agreeing on the penetration policy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in South China Launches Guangzhou-Kowloon Road Campaign Information Minister Explains the Significance of the Operation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army announced on the 13th that the Japanese army had begun a punitive operation in the area between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, saying: The Japanese army in South China, in close cooperation with the Hong Kong Governor's Department, launched a thorough purge operation at dawn on the 11th against the Chongqing army and the Communist army entrenched along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line and to protect communication with the Hong Kong defense force. The purpose of this operation is to eradicate the source of the chaos that has plagued the security along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, expand the security perimeter, and seek the rapid development of Hong Kong and South China.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram The Information Minister of the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army gave a speech on the 12th explaining the significance and purpose of the new operation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, saying that the Japanese South China Expeditionary Army, based on the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, in close cooperation with the Japanese defense forces, began the purge operation along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line on the 11th. The purpose of this operation is to purge the Chongqing army along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, greatly strengthen the security of the peaceful areas, and ensure the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong in order to develop the political, economic, and cultural sectors of South China and promote the prosperity of Guangdong and Hong Kong. The lives of the general public in the vicinity can also be given great convenience and happiness. At this time of the decisive battle in Greater East Asia, the Japanese army is even able to seek the prosperity of the people's livelihood, which is enough to prove the strength of Japan's national power. At the same time, it can be understood that the Japanese army's move is based on the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and is carried out with moral sincerity in order to cooperate with China's development. Today's Chongqing has become a rabid dog collapsing in America, ignoring the new situation in East Asia and shouting for blind resistance. However, the progress of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not hindered by Chongqing's resistance. Chongqing is plunging China into the path of destruction and hindering the unity of East Asia, which is a crime against China and a traitor to East Asia.</p>

<p>Unite Greater East Asia Youths and Practice the Greater East Asia Declaration</p>
<p>Speech by Director-General Lin Jian on Tokyo Radio</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of our New Sports Association and Director-General of the Chinese Youth Corps, delivered a radio speech at 8:40 PM on the 12th from the Central Broadcasting Station here, entitled "Unite Greater East Asia Youths and Practice the Greater East Asia Declaration." The original text is recorded as follows: November 6th is the day of the birth of the New East Asia. On this day, representatives from China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma solemnly and seriously signed a treaty of alliance for our East Asian countries to share life and death, defend and attack together, rely on each other, and coexist and prosper. What is most exciting is that Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, also attended on behalf of the Indian compatriots who make up one-third of the population of Greater East Asia. The New East Asia, the Youth East Asia, was born in this atmosphere of sincere unity, promoting the inherent moral spirit of the East and washing away the dirt of the past one or two hundred years. Following the Greater East Asia Conference, China, Japan, and Manchukuo solemnly and seriously held the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference. This day was also the day when all the youth and people of China, under the leadership of the leader, held a memorial service to realize the will of the founding father. This tells us that our founding father's will to save China and protect East Asia has, today, due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the signing of the Greater East Asia Declaration, been realized. The founding father showed us that the Chinese revolution must obtain the understanding of Japan and expect Japan to assist us in abolishing unequal treaties. Today, we have obtained the understanding of our allies and the assistance of our allies, laying the foundation for independence. Moreover, because our allies are acting as the vanguard in defending East Asia, the liberation of Greater East Asia can be expected in the near future. We use this to console the spirit of the founding father in heaven, console the revolutionary martyrs, the martyrs of luck, and the spirits of all the warriors in the Greater East Asia War in heaven. We are not just mourning the past, not just being content with the present, and not just thanking our allies. We have a greater responsibility, which is to advance the existing realistic foundation and create our future. This is a general responsibility, especially the responsibility of young people. We must unite the youth of China and Japan and practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. We must unite the youth of Greater East Asia and practice the Greater East Asia Declaration. The necessity of "unity" and "practice" is known and demanded by everyone, but it is by no means the power of empty talk that can achieve mutual respect and mutual assistance. We must also ask ourselves how we should effectively assist our Indian compatriots who are still groaning under the iron heel of aggressors in completing their final desperate battle for independence. "Mutual respect for national traditions" and "promotion of East Asian culture" are the third article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should unleash the creative abilities of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, while maintaining their inherent characteristics and developing them upwards, and at the same time adapting to their needs for mutual invention and integrating them. "Mutually beneficial economic cooperation" and "enhancing East Asian prosperity" are the promises of the Greater East Asia Treaty, so that "ensuring East Asian stability" and "realizing coexistence and co-prosperity" can be achieved, which are the first article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how much strength we have contributed and how much responsibility we have shared in the war to sweep away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States and defend East Asia. We must ask ourselves how we should try to eliminate the various toxins that hinder the coexistence and co-prosperity of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia. "Strive for autonomy and independence" and "practice mutual assistance and harmony" are the second article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should wash away the psychology of discrimination, jealousy, resentment, and suspicion in order to achieve mutual love and affection. The fourth article of faith is to strengthen autonomy and independence. We must ask ourselves how we should eradicate utilitarianism, fight for self-interest, and base ourselves on the iron rules of division of labor, cooperation, equality, mutual need, and mutual supplementation to sacrifice personal small interests for the benefit of the country and the overall benefit of Greater East Asia. "Combat racial discrimination" and "promote world unity" are the fifth article of faith in the Greater East Asia Treaty. We must ask ourselves how we should grasp the trend of human history, combine nationalities through cultural exchange and resource development, and combine races to contribute to world peace. This is not only a landmark international diplomacy in Greater East Asia, but also a landmark iron rule for national coexistence in Greater East Asian history. Every East Asian, every East Asian youth, in thought, in life, in career, in words and deeds, in every action, should be vigilant in order to achieve what the Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference has decided on the plan for the unity of Greater East Asian youth. The unity we demand is not formal, but spiritual. We must make the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia follow the youth of the allied countries and gather together on the same front in the ideological war. We must make the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia truly share weal and woe in life and career. In particular, we ask the youth of the allied countries to set an example of striving for East Asia, mobilize the total strength of the youth of all countries in Greater East Asia, contribute to the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, and eliminate all obstacles to the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. "Relying on each other, supporting each other, coexisting and co-prospering" is the only foundation for victory. Victory is the only prerequisite for relying on each other, supporting each other, coexisting and co-prospering. Although the youth in Chongqing have not been able to gather with us due to environmental reasons, we are convinced that all Chinese youth who love China and love East Asia will surely embark on this great road to save China and protect East Asia. It can be determined that the youth leaders of other countries in Greater East Asia have not had time to participate in this conference due to time constraints, but we are convinced that their demands are no different, and their efforts are no different from ours. We are willing to extend our warm hands with full enthusiasm to welcome them. We call loudly to unite the youth of Greater East Asia and practice the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>

<p>Fundraising for Privately Run Social Welfare Undertakings Requires Approval</p>
<p>Explanation of Key Points by Welfare Department Office</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) - The Social Welfare Department, in order to unify the fundraising for welfare funds, previously organized the Central and Shanghai Social Welfare Fundraising Committees, which were established on the 3rd of this month. Regulations have also been formulated regarding the fundraising for privately run social welfare undertakings and have been submitted to this week's Executive Yuan meeting for approval. The person in charge of the Social Welfare Department's Shanghai office specifically explained its meaning and key points to those present yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Fundraising to Prevent Malpractice</p>
<p>Unifying the fundraising for social welfare funds is a necessary measure for actively promoting social welfare. In the past, fundraising for welfare funds was carried out by various groups and organizations independently due to the lack of a dedicated management agency. Not only was the strength weak and the results not significant, but the following malpractices were also prone to occur:</p>
<p>Fundraising for each welfare undertaking, whether selling tickets or soliciting donations, was concentrated on a small number of famous gentry, causing them to be overwhelmed and exhausted, resulting in a negative impression of fundraising.</p>
<p>Another part of wealthy individuals, whose assets were many times greater than those of famous gentry, were able to evade donations because they were not noticed by society. There were even many who did not donate a single cent to public undertakings throughout their lives, which was an unreasonable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Private undertakings raised funds independently, and because there was no dedicated management agency to supervise and audit, donors were unaware of the achievements of the undertakings, whether they were worth donating to, and how the donated funds were used, which led to malpractices. The loss of donated funds was not what donors wanted. Therefore, the Social Welfare Department has formulated regulations for unifying the fundraising for welfare funds.</p>
<p>Procedures for Fundraising</p>
<p>In the future, for privately run social welfare undertakings, such as physical, labor, vocational, public interest, charity, relief, and other positive and negative social welfare undertakings, the fundraising will be managed by the Central Social Welfare Fundraising Committee for national undertakings and by the local Social Welfare Fundraising Committee for local undertakings. The committee in this city has already been established. Subsequently, regardless of whether the undertaking is permanent or temporary, and regardless of whether the fundraising method is issuing donation booklets, selling goods for charity, or holding gatherings, art exhibitions, concerts, dances, martial arts competitions, or various ball games and theatrical performances, or using radio stations to solicit donations from all parties, the organizer or person in charge must apply to the Fundraising Committee for approval in advance.</p>
<p>The name of the undertaking, the process of handling it, future plans, financial situation, proposed amount to be raised, fundraising period, fundraising method, use of donations, and other items should be detailed and reported to the Fundraising Committee for review.</p>
<p>If it is necessary to invite famous gentry to be listed as initiators or sponsors when fundraising, the signatures and seals of the individuals should be obtained and reported to the Fundraising Committee for review and verification before being announced to the public.</p>
<p>All donation booklets, receipts, and tickets should be numbered and sent to the Fundraising Committee for stamping to be valid.</p>
<p>Fundraising is Prohibited Without Approval</p>
<p>Secondly, the total fundraising expenses:</p>
<p>Should be based on the donor's willingness and should not be allocated or solicited by other coercive methods.</p>
<p>Regardless of the amount raised, the donated funds should be deposited in a bank, and a management committee should be organized by the person in charge of the undertaking and relevant personnel and reported to the Fundraising Committee for record before being managed.</p>
<p>It should be distributed according to the specified purpose and should not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>At the end of the fundraising, the progress and the total amount raised should be reported to the Fundraising Committee for record and reported to the Social Welfare Department for review. The Fundraising Committee, after reviewing and approving the application for fundraising, will notify the newspapers for verification and publish a public announcement. Newspapers should first verify whether the fundraising advertisements and news have been notified and approved by the Fundraising Committee. Those who have not been notified should not be published. If fundraisers violate the regulations, the Fundraising Committee may impose a fine.</p>
<p>First Police Bureau Organizes Special Traffic Squad</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) - The Traffic Section of the First Police Bureau, in order to maintain the citizens' "safety first", strictly manages the traffic rules for vehicles. In addition to dispatching police officers to direct traffic at key traffic intersections, it also dispatches senior police officers to organize special traffic squads to assist in directing traffic at various road intersections. One or two officers are also stationed at each tram stop to call on passengers to get on and off the tram in order to avoid extreme overcrowding and dangerous situations. Regulations have also been established for various trams and buses to stop at designated stations. The implementation has been quite effective, and dangerous accidents have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Japanese-Manchukuo Education Delegation Has Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Japanese-Manchukuo Education Delegation has returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to report to the relevant authorities on the 14th on the progress of the inspection. The local education authorities are scheduled to hold a banquet to welcome the delegation back.</p>
<p>Deadline for Payment of Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax in the Eighth District</p>

<p>Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Cheng Zhiliang yesterday stating that a pot of Epiphyllum plants at the Daguan Art Gallery attached to the Dahua Plant Company at the intersection of Maoming Road and Jing'an Temple Road in this city is the world's most precious plant. On the evening of the 11th of this month, the flower buds bloomed, and they were fully bloomed by 11:00 PM. The cold fragrance was refreshing, which was a spectacle. Moreover, Epiphyllum usually has only 14 or 15 pistils, but that evening there were as many as 17, which was especially rare. At that time, those who heard the news and went to appreciate it included Mr. Yuan Lvdeng, his wife, Yan Bolin, Zhonglin, Jilin, Xie Jialin, Jiang Guozhang, Lu Bingyuan, Shen Xiaofang, Zhao Kaizhang, Bao Xiaodie, Li Yushu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Le Runtin, Li Yingyang, Zhang Bofang, Jiang Yiqiu, Shui Aochen, and Shi Jifu, as well as painters Tao Lengyue and Jiang Hanting.

In addition to Mr. Yuan Lvdeng's impromptu inscription, Wen Guanting, Lin Kanghou, and famous calligraphy and painting artists Gao Yehou, Ding Fuzhi, Huang Taixuan, and Zhao Shuju also wrote inscriptions. The rare flowers and famous works complemented each other. In order to support the Shen Xin two newspapers' scholarship funds, it was decided to hold a charity sale of the painting, and many people have been in contact. It is estimated that it can be sold for at least 50,000 yuan. All of the proceeds will be transferred to the Shen Xin two newspapers' scholarship funds. There is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society, and they are eager to participate in the purchase to support the charity. Contact Mr. Cheng Zhiliang for details.</p>
<p>Ninth Anniversary of the Death of Mr. Shi Liangcai</p>
<p>Our Newspaper Colleagues Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the ninth anniversary of the death of Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former general manager of our newspaper. All of our newspaper colleagues gathered at our office at 10:00 AM yesterday to hold a memorial meeting and pay our respects. Time flies, and it has been nine years since Mr. Shi passed away. Looking at his remains, our grief is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Short Commentary on the Portrait of Mr. Shi Liangcai</p>
<p>Air Defense Training for Railways</p>
<p>The city's air defense propaganda conference has just ended, and the China Railway Company will conduct full-line air defense training for one week from the 18th to the 23rd of this month. The reason is that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently frequently bombarded Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, killing our compatriots. The purpose of carrying out air defense training is to call on travelers to pay attention and conduct training in advance to reduce damage in case of emergency.</p>
<p>The puppet regime is being coerced and used by the U.S. Air Force, blindly bombing and killing our compatriots, which should be despised by the Chinese people. However, since the situation is hostile, bombing is not an unexpected event. We must clearly understand all kinds of common sense about air defense, and we must install all kinds of equipment as much as possible. Remaining calm is useless!</p>
<p>Traffic lines are the targets most concerned by the enemy during wartime. It is a common thing for countries to carry out air defense training during wartime. The China Railway Company's air defense training is necessary. We hope that all employees of the railway will take the lead, abide by the regulations, and strictly implement them as an example for passengers. At the same time, passengers should not only cooperate with the railway authorities, but also train themselves, and they must follow the regulations of the authorities and fully cooperate.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the China Railway Company authorities will do more preparatory work before the implementation period, such as advising and guiding passengers at the station and on the train, in order to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Director of Reporting Department of the Ministry of the Navy Matsushima Announces the Situation in the Pacific War</p>
<p>Completely Defeated the Enemy's Attempt</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) - Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Navy, announced the situation in the Pacific War at a meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city yesterday:</p>
<p>Launched a Naval Battle</p>
<p>Director Matsushima first stated: In the naval battle in the Solomon Islands in late October of this year, the enemy's powerful fleet attacked on October 31. The Japanese Navy received the report and immediately issued an alarm, preparing to strike a heavy blow. The enemy forces attacked in three teams, with one team attacking Monono Island, one team landing on Bougainville Island, and another team assisting from the side. The second Bougainville Air Battle was thus launched. Later, the Headquarters of the Japanese Fleet received news that three enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and two destroyers were sunk. The next day, another major victory was won in the Bougainville Air-Naval Battle. In this battle, an unprecedentedly great result was achieved, with four enemy cruisers, two destroyers sunk, two enemy aircraft carriers, two destroyers, one transport ship sunk, and 15 enemy aircraft shot down. The enemy fleet attacked in the Solomon Islands this time suffered heavy damage, which can be said to be completely defeated. Since the enemy used its air force to attack the Pacific Ocean in August last year, its strength has increased day by day, but now it has completely failed. The enemy's losses have exceeded 10,000, but to this day, the enemy's air force that circles and hovers over the Solomon Islands every day is only 150 aircraft, so it has completely exposed signs of no progress.</p>
<p>Completely Defeated</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese army's unprecedentedly great victory this time has made the enemy's situation in the future self-evident. Mr. Matsushima analyzed four points, including: The enemy's plan to attack in the Solomon Islands completely failed, and the enemy's generals and soldiers shed blood for a year, but now it has all been shed; The British and American coalition forces suffered another major blow, and we should wait and see when the enemy finally announces the day of defeat; The British and Americans suffered heavy losses in the fighting in Burma, and now they can no longer cross the Japanese-occupied area; The British and Americans' future attempts to counterattack have also been greatly affected as a result. According to the current damage to the enemy's forces in two unfavorable expeditions, 80% of their well-trained troops have been lost. Therefore, this current emergency, even if the United States actively trains its troops again, it will be difficult to save the situation. For example, it takes at least 15 years to train a naval destroyer captain.</p>
<p>Deceiving the Country</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima severely criticized the United States' propaganda as being boring and full of errors, which we can all prove with facts. It is reported that the Japanese General Headquarters announced the news that the United States had been secretly discussing the traces of this Pacific War with several generals and staff chiefs called together by General King and Chief of Staff Marshall for a long time. The content was kept secret and unreal. Afterwards, the facts were concealed, and the domestic announcement was falsely claimed to have lost only a few destroyers. Later, when American journalists visited Naval Secretary Knox, they also concealed Japan's victory. However, the knowledgeable people in the United States and the family members of the soldiers who went to war knew they were being deceived and urged the government to publish the truth about this incident from afar. At that time, American military tactics critic Bauerwin commented that the US military tactics had failed, so the mystery of the US military achievements was deeply disturbing in the country.</p>
<p>Burma War Situation</p>
<p>Shi also commented on the war situation of the Chongqing army in Burma. Yu Fang said that it would launch an offensive after the rainy season, but it has not yet been realized. According to the news from Washington on the 5th of this month: The British, American, and Yu parties held a meeting in Yu, and the participants included Stilwell. General De Montbatten. Somapier, the commander of the replenishment, and Chiang Kai-shek, etc. There were five people. As a result of the meeting, it was difficult for all parties to feel the difficulty in terms of terrain, replenishment, and command. Especially in the command aspect, Yu Fang paid attention to his own position. However, the original intention of the British and Americans was to sacrifice Yu's army in order to satisfy their own desires. Therefore, the current famine in India caused serious deaths among the Indian people. Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, the morale of the people has become increasingly shaken, so the British and Americans have felt difficulty in using Indian soldiers to fight. Therefore, the British and Americans had no choice but to use the Yu army. Recently, Yu Fang announced that it had transported more than 400 young men from Yu to India. These young men are 1.58 meters tall and weigh 84 Cairo grams. These excellent young men will be outstanding talents in China's future construction, so this time transporting them to India, subject to the manipulation of the British and Americans, is regrettable.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with Yu Fang</p>
<p>Wei Matsushima said that during the Japanese army's crossing of the Nu River, it pursued from the west bank to the east bank. At that time, the Yu army was quite critical. It had previously requested assistance from the British and American coalition forces in India to send troops to assist, but it was ignored, causing the Yu party to suffer significant losses. It is said that the Chen Jian army of the Yu party is quite dissatisfied and has had major conflicts with the British and American forces, and friction is becoming increasingly acute. However, the Yu party does not know how to extricate itself, hesitates on the wrong path, and is exploited by the British and Americans. It should quickly realize its mistake and cooperate in the construction of Greater East Asia. Finally, Shi estimated that the British and Americans' losses in the war totaled 165 million yuan in Chinese currency for each warship, but the Japanese army only needed two aircraft worth 3 million yuan in Chinese currency to sink them. The difference in losses between the two sides was significant. According to the current situation, the bombing power of the Japanese Air Force is quite strong and will not be afraid of any large number of enemy aircraft. Afterwards, the minister stated that any country can be destroyed if China and Japan cooperate in combat. In the Solomon Islands battle, there were more than 1,000 enemy aircraft, but the Japanese aircraft were quite few, and they were able to achieve great victories and give the enemy a major blow.</p>
<p>Application for Shanghai West Residence Permit</p>
<p>Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Personnel Transfers and Handover Procedures Not Completed</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the old West Shanghai District was recently merged into the First District, the police station is currently rejecting applicants for residence permits. The reason is that the personnel transfers and handover procedures have not been completed. Applications will only be accepted and issued again in about three weeks. As for citizens in the district who have applied to the district and been rejected, they are allowed to use their original foreign pass. If this causes inconvenience, they can explain the reason for the temporary suspension of the issuance of Shanghai West resident permits to the inspector.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Central China Occupy Ziliangping and Advance Towards Bashan to Launch an Encirclement</h3>
<p>Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): The main force of the 79th Army of the Chongqing (渝) forces, including the 194th Division and the 98th Division, as well as the Provisional 6th Division, totaling approximately 60,000 men, in the Xiang (湘) and Hubei (鄂) border region, previously suffered a fierce attack by the Japanese army and collapsed westward into the mountains. As the Japanese army intensified its encirclement, the Chongqing forces attempted to break out, putting up a desperate resistance. The Japanese army not only concentrated artillery fire for a fierce attack but also deployed air units for heavy bombing. The Chongqing forces, suffering this severe blow, collapsed and fled. The Japanese army completely occupied Ziliangping (south of Yuyangguan 漁洋關), a strategic point for the Chongqing forces, at 10:00 AM on the 13th. Approximately 1,000 men of the 2nd Regiment of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces fled into the ravines. The main force of the 79th Army of the Chongqing 10th Army Group, which had established a position near Nuan Shuijie 暖水街, Zhakou 閘口, and Wangjiachang 王家廠, was defeated by the Japanese army within just one week.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Enter Yidu</p>
<p>Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to support the operation of destroying the 79th Army of the Chongqing forces, the Japanese army is now pursuing the 66th Army of the Chongqing forces along the Yangtze River. They occupied Yidu 宜都 on the evening of the 11th. Another unit captured Xiongdu 熊渡 (28 kilometers southwest of Yidu) at 1:00 PM on the 10th. Another unit of the Japanese army also captured Nie Jiahe 聶家河 (20 kilometers southwest of Yidu) on the evening of the 11th.</p>
<p>Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): On the evening of the 11th, the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the remnants of the 98th, 194th, and Provisional 6th Divisions of the Chongqing forces near Xinmenshi 新門寺 and Tongzixi 桐子溪, west of the Chixi River 赤溪河, and are now advancing towards Bashan 芭山. The Japanese troops above the Hekou 河口 area pursued the Chongqing forces on the evening of the 11th, advancing to Ziliangpo 子良坡, 16 kilometers southwest of Yuyangguan, inflicting a devastating blow on approximately 2,000 men of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces. Furthermore, the Japanese vanguard has reached the vicinity of Taipingjie 太平街 (28 li northwest of Hekou), completely cutting off the retreat of the defeated remnants of the 98th, 194th, and Provisional 6th Divisions of the Chongqing forces from the east. Additionally, the Japanese troops heading north from the Chixi River attacked along the Xizhai River 西齋河, reaching Yangmudong 羊木洞 (15 kilometers west of the Chixi River) on the evening of the 11th, fiercely attacking the 78th Division of the Chongqing forces attempting to cross the Xizhai River to escape. According to current reports, the headquarters of the 79th Army of the Chongqing forces is trapped within the Japanese encirclement and is seeking a way to escape. Simultaneously, the Japanese army also attacked the main force of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces, approximately 2,000 men, near Xinmenshi, and a part of the 194th Division of the Chongqing forces near Tongzixi. Currently, the Chongqing forces in the Bashan area are in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Restoration of Public Security in Nan County</p>
<p>Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency): Nan County 南縣, recently occupied by the Japanese army, was previously the defense area of the 44th Army of the Chongqing forces, and the county residents suffered greatly from oppressive rule. Although only six days have passed since the Japanese army entered the city, public security has been completely restored, and the residents have all returned. Before the Chongqing forces retreated, they extensively propagandized to the residents of the Nan County area, ordering them to carry their belongings and flee along with them, and regardless of their willingness, they destroyed houses, causing the returning residents to be homeless for a time. However, things have gradually returned to normal, and the residents are voluntarily cooperating with the Japanese army in repairing roads, purchasing supplies, and working diligently. A newly established clinic in the city has many local residents with illnesses seeking diagnosis and treatment every day. The Public Security Maintenance Association will be established soon.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced on the 13th that the Japanese government, in order to adapt to the recent situation in East Asia, is assigning a minister to Turkey to assist Ambassador Tairahara stationed in Turkey.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kiev Area, Soviet Army Plans to Shift Focus</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency): DNB reports: German military circles believe that the recent developments in the Eastern Front have confirmed the Soviet army's plan to "shift the focus of the war." The Soviet army's repeated attempts to break into the lower Sozh River area and the concentration of troops north of Krivoy Rog are likely for this purpose. However, the current focus of the war is still in the Kiev area. It is now reported that the fighting on the north and south sides of Kiev has formed a three-way stalemate. With Zhitomir as a key point, the German army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the attacking Soviet army. The offensive in the lower Sozh River area, northwest of Nikopol, has eased compared to the previous days, but the Soviet army is still gathering reinforcements, and fierce fighting seems likely to occur at any time.</p>
