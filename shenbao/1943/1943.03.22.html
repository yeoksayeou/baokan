<p>社評</p>
<h3>參戰·政治與外交</h3>
<p>參戰與建國興業的重要關係，以及人民的期待，昨評已略論述。我們認爲參戰與建國興業，應是相濟相長的，但是無論參戰·建國與興業，都視政治與外交政策之成續如何而始可獲得結論。參戰以來，未及三月，言政治則有戰時體制之實現，言外交則有日本對華新政策之開始。我們站在人民的立塲，　所期望於政府者至爲殷切，敬敢繼論述參戰。建國與興業之後，以言政治與外交。</p>
<p>政治的範圍至爲廣大，而最重要的是國家制度問題。我國五千年的歷史，雖多燦爛光輝的事蹟，但因爲在長期的君中專制制度之下，天下爲私，政治上光明的日子極少，黑暗的時期較長，數十年一小亂，數百年一大亂，往復不息，雖古聖先賢創造寳貴的文化，而常不能機承發揚光大。尤其自宋以降，文化進程停滯，國民體力日衰，推究其故，實由於「家天下」的關係，人民無地位無權力，聽任統治者驅使奴役而不能自奮，於是人禍與天災荐至，而國是日非了。辛亥鼎革，推翻數千年相承的專制制度，中華民族得見天日，但因專制歷時太久，政治積弊太深，社會習慣太壞，使這歷史改造工作在短時期內不易顯露理想的光明。嗣經中日事變，國論紛歧，憂患相尋，國家有分裂之禍，人民有流離之苦。但幸在還都前後，得中日雙方諸領袖之努力，使沿江沿海各省得慶復甦。今更因參戰而增高國際地位，戰時政治體制更有與民更始之氣象，如能乘此時機，修政政治，革新政風，則可完成辛亥以來未竟的功業，建樹中華民國永久的基礎。我們祈望當代的政治家，當基於世界新秩序的見地，努力喚起人民，組織人民，健全基層政治機構，使人人知道國家之可愛，政府之可敬，則其利益，近之則民力可以集中，國家可以健全；而遠之則東亞永久和平的建樹亦可由此而肇始。</p>
<p>但是無庸諱言的。在此新時代中，中國之政治，已非一國之事，而與整個東亞的命運，有不可分離的關係；而中日兩國同甘共苦的關係尤為密切。自參戰以還，日本對我政策，已有極大的光明的轉變，凡所表現，皆足令人興奮。在此新時代，我國的外交政策，自應增加信心，不論現在與將來，均應與我國策相同的友邦，共同奮鬥。但是我國百年來已成列强角逐之地，久陷於半殖民地狀態，為東亞永久和平計，必有强大的中國，方足以言與友邦協力而永保東亞的安定。今日友邦新政策之出發點，當不外乎此。同時因我國多年貧弱，也不免有民族自卑心理，對外人在華行動，或仍多以傳統的眼光來衡評而自感不安，這種微妙的心理意識，如任其潛伏滋長，也會發生不幸的誤解。我們認爲中國國民應加强自信心，也希望友邦人民徹底了解中國爲信義和平的民族，決不妨碍他人合法的利益。因此我們的外交政策，絕對要造一個獨立自由的現什國家，凡同情贊助我們的，都是朋友，我們要對他們和睦親善，始終不渝。在獲得此種平等以後，決不自私其力，而將善用其人力資源，與共患難同利害的友邦協力邁進，盡力於樹立東亞永久和平的新秩序。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>國府經濟政策的發展</h3>
<p>日本政府以中國參戰爲機緣，已實行對華政策的轉換。爲達成建立中國的自主獨立之目的起見，決定交還租界，撤廢治外法權，委讓維持洽安責任，限制特務機關的干涉行政等，而且已經聲明過了。其動作不外是希望中國能自立自强之後，來分担遂行大東亞戰爭的責任。</p>
<p>中國爲響應日本的這個政策轉換，已毅然實行其各種政策的改革和樹立，而對於被認爲最迫切的經濟政策，先實行改組全國經濟委員會爲國府直屬機關，增加委員人數，容納金融界有力人士，以之作爲最高機關，作爲經濟中樞，作爲轉向參戰下中國經濟政策之新起點。</p>
<p>經最高國防會議而發表的戰時經濟政策綱領，是其最初的事業，爲今後國府經濟方針的基本，非加以重視不可。這個綱領分爲增加生產，調整物價，節約消費，安定通貨價值及調節金融，改造經濟機構等五個項目，其增加生產一項，爲關於增加農工礦業的生產力者，因此規定原料燃料的確保，利潤的保證等；調整物價一項，規定運輸機構的改善，配給機構的調整，囤積居奇的取締；節約消費一項，規定代用品的增產，非急需品及奢侈品的限制生產；通貨金融一項，規定以儲備券爲中心，改善金融機構，獎勵儲蓄，恢復農工礦業金融機構，禁止投機；改造經濟機構一項，規定經濟機構的再編組，由生產至配給過程一貫的機構之設置，團體的經營制度之實施等。這個綱領的特色，在於其把握着目前中國緊急問題的重點，然而問題却在於如何實踐這個綱領。國府基於上述的基本綱領，於本月十一日頒布了全國商業就制總會暫行條例。該條例中規定每種商品設立統制會，在上海設立就制總會以統率之，又另設一日華合作之物　統制審議會，作為諮詢機關。統制會於國府監督之下，以民間之自治的統制辦法，以行統制物資之收買配給，輸入物資之供給配給等。據梅實業部長的談話，統制會有着實行政治與經濟的分離，由政府的統制移行於民間目治的統制之特色。</p>
<p>與該條例同時頒布的，有戰時物資移動取締暫行條例。關於華中物資的移動，早在日方實施之中，如施行揚子江下流軍佔據地物資移動取締暫行規定，（民國三十年九月公布），上海地區物資搬出入限制規定，淸鄉地區物資移動規定等等，然而由於國府新公布之物資栘動取締規定，上述揚子江地域取締規定的大部分，即被廢止，而基於該規定之其他限制規定，以及淸鄕地區內物資移動限制等，亦被撒廢，故和平地區內的物資移動取締，已較以前大爲自由了。華中目前面臨國難的物資不足，因着該二條例的作用如何，可由移動的促進而得補給，在物資的蒐集，配給上，可說是事變以來之歷史的改革。</p>
<p>更可注目者，則按照財政部布吿，以儲備銀行的資金，設立新中央儲蓄會，由該會籌劃發行復興經濟獎券，分期繳款儲蓄券，及有獎還木儲券等三種新券。這種辦法，是政策綱領中關於獎勵儲蓄的實行手段之一。欲調整目前在華中成爲問題之通貨與物資的不平均，無論如何有吸收餘剩購買力的必要，此等儲蓄券與預料最近即將發行之糧食庫券，可認爲於通貨的回流，負有重大的任務，所以這又是一個新的政策而值得注目的。</p>
<p>本月十日以後，將在鎭江地區開始新的淸鄕工作，又不久蘇北的淸鄕亦將開始。此等淸鄕，與從來所行者不同，由中國爲主體而自主的行之，而且因爲此等地區爲治安上，經濟上的重要地點，故此項工作使政府得到的經濟效果頗大。這樣，由國府經營之華中目主的經濟再編組事業，正在步步實踐，日本之遠大的政策轉變，不久就可得到督果，故吾人進而希望其對於增强大東亞戰力，有極大的貢獻。（丁：譯自三月十四日讀者報知）</p>

<h3>日美空戰座談會（三）　從空襲路綫說到防禦方法種種</h3>
<p>由缺乏航空知識而生的悲劇，要具有來者不懼的準備和決心。</p>
<p>記者：任何時候來都不要緊，都不會發生悲劇，要有這種充分準備和堅强決心，如果這樣常此繼續下去，用緊張的情緒……。</p>
<p>本內：那即是有恃無恐囉！</p>
<p>岡田：若是想到另外一個極端，也是具有危險性的。同時，疏忽也是具有危險性的。使人民很淸楚地認識正確的標準和客觀條件的要求，這是負責者的天職。例如上次四月十八日空襲後，散佈着各種反動傳說，也聽到五花八門的意見，若分析一下這種情形，就可以知道缺乏航空知識，以致說出毫無邊際的話，這也就是反動傳說的唯一原因，例如對於飛機速度的觀念，幾乎想像得如神話中的事情。再就是對於飛機的航行力，說得太過火，簡直是沒有一點常識。由於這種結果，就流行各式各樣的想像，以致自己混亂慌張，我國雖然有防空宣傳，但還應當對國民多灌輸些航空知識和飛機知識，否則就不瞭解眞正的防空信念。舉一個眼前實例來看，在上次空襲時，竟有人說，出神人化地飛來，這並不是出神入化，而是每小時飛五百公里左右。這並非是經濟速力。是按戰鬥速力飛的，正如在火車裏眺望遠山一樣，就是連這種常識也沒有，所以說出神入化和從從容容地飛，如果再少懂一點科學知識的話，於實際親眼看見後，再對於那種飛機有每小時若干公里的速度有「些常識的話，就不會胡說八道。儘管講，要決心，要果斷，要鎭靜，這都不行，所以說，因此就不再有極端的恐懼心了，這實在等於欺騙小孩子，這也是一種非科學的想法。我認爲先決問題就在於多液輸航空常識。</p>
<p>大西：例如飛機向自己方面飛來，若是知道普通在什麼地方投彈才能落到自己身邊，這就好了；但當飛機投彈時，以爲將落到自己身邊，這是因爲沒有飛機投彈的常識，飛機在自己頭上飛，而投下的炸彈決不會落在自己的頭上。若是沒有這種常識，無論在什麼地方投彈，總覺得要落在自己身上。</p>
<p>岡田：當看的時候是這樣感覺。向自己頭上飛來時却不以爲是如此了。這一類的角度，這一類的常識，實在太缺欠了。</p>
<p>大西：大家都說是自己的正上面，但正上面只有一點。</p>
<p>松浦：人的眼睛有錯覺。</p>
<p>阿部：這類知識必須灌輸給國民。</p>
<p>大西：大體上，若是來到什麼地方炸彈就落到自己身邊，這一點大槪都知道。向傍面飛而投的炸彈不會落在自己身邊。一直對着自己飛而在某種角度上投落的炸彈，是可能落在自己的地方。在我住的地方，最使人擔心的是沒有避難所。到什麼地方去就可以得到安全呢？這種地方沒有。在我住的地方，到森林裏去就可以安全麼？這不一定安全。若是有一個可靠的避難所可以躱避空襲，那就都沉着而不驚慌了，但是我們沒有這種防空避難所。有的人在自己家裏穿鑿防空洞，但沒有達到眞正安全的地步。安全的防空洞，差不多在私人住宅裏都沒有。無論什麼時候演習，成爲問題的總是到何處去避難的問題。因爲沒有絕對安全的地方，所以避難的地方也不許安全，且在避難所裏聚集很多的人，炸彈也許落在這個地方，所以安全鞏固的防空洞是迫切需要的，同時這類安全防空洞不要距離人民太遠，於是決不會發生慌張與混亂現象。然而東京無論何處，大概都如此。</p>
<p>岡田：化險爲夷的辦法，只有盡量不集中於一處。</p>
<p>大西：按理說，緊着旗幟號召兒童與老叟團集在一處，且把傷病者也拖到此處來，這倒是一件危險事。</p>
<p>阿部：如果站立在公園的曠野裏，炸彈若落在遠地方，彈片也不會碰到自己身上。若在窪地裏臥着，若炸彈落到相當的地方也不會危險。這就是說，伏在地上，不要團集在一處，各別分散開，就能達到近於絕對安全的程度。</p>
<p>大西：我想我的房子不會落上炸彈。</p>
<p>阿部：在房子裏冉間隔上一蓆的地方，如住在這裏面是比較保險的。大家都在一起，這是頂危險的。</p>
<p>如何躱避空襲？需要日本式的指導方法。</p>
<p>記者：這樣看來，避難需要各別分散地，逃到適當地方，去　是最好辦法了。</p>
<p>阿部：所謂避難，是在炸彈尙未投下時，就準備應付燃燒彈所引起的大火，毒氣彈强烈有害的爆裂等等，這才是戰時避難的唯一精神。</p>
<p>岡田：因爲飛機在自己頭上的飛翔，頂多也不過十分鐘，所以在附近陰溝裏臥倒一下，或是靠在水門汀的牆上等一下，但最好辦法，我認爲是在就近地方臥倒一下，在上次四月十八日的空襲，臥倒者都免於難這當然不能不說歸功於宣傳躱避空襲的方法。這種臥倒訓練是很需要的，例如婦女明知道臥倒是對的，但因無訓練，結果被彈片擊死。其中也有臥倒在面前七公尺的地方炸彈響了而意免於難的人，還有鑽進乒乓球台下面而救了自己命的人，曾有小孩子躱在水槽底背面，而竟化險爲夷相反的例證，則有竚立着被高射砲的碎彈片打死的人。在近來訓練期間，有很多人對於躱避發生了極大的爭論，他們說用不着作躱避塲，躱避是對日本天性不合的，這是一種怯懦行爲，日本人是要冒險出來救火的，是要在槍林彈雨中搶救的，躱避就莫如不當救火員，去到防空洞好。這種說法是不對的，因爲在戰爭時候，甚至衝鋒時候，都要有一時的掩護和遮蔽，然後才能前進，同時又因爲掩護前進是衝鋒的基本綱領，所以就有救火員在敵機飛走很遠的時候，仍然還不肯出躱避塲，這眞無辦法。藏在躱避塲裏，一呆就是兩個鐘頭，那什麼也就不用作了。關於這些問題，很不容易糾正得恰到好處，當緊急警報發出後，應當在十五分鐘左右敵機飛來，但有時緊急警報後一點多鐘敵機尙不飛來，因此便派一個瞭望者，瞭望者看到敵機飛臨市空而發出空襲警報時，才到躱避塲去，然後在各處落下炸彈後，就從躱避塲出去救火。事有不搓巧者，其中竟有人說，我上次看錯了，下次我無論如何都要好好看。</p>
<p>本內；關於躱避的事惰，如果不特別强調的話，當單純用普通强調的時候，是不會發生有效結果的，且躱避是一分鐘左右的瞬息間事，所以這一點在日本人方面是很不容易作到的。</p>
<p>大西：都想，別人看見了，而我沒看見，這是一件如何抱憾事。也都抱着鄙視怯懦的觀念。</p>
<p>岡田：所以必須有合乎日本人的指導方法，講看，高射砲的彈片之類的東西，也有相當危險，所以當高射砲射出的時間，也應當少微躱避一下。</p>
<p>藤田：高射砲碎片也相當危險麼？</p>
<p>大西：若不戴鋼盔是危險的，</p>
<p>岡田：所以想在高射砲陣地自由活動的人，一定都要躱避。我有一次到松並第四國民小學去參觀躱避訓練，該處因爲是人烟稠密的地帶，由於校長熱心率導全體職敎員以及學生訓練，結果非常良好。小學生全帶着座墊。把這個座墊用鈕扣結在身邊，當發空襲警報底時候，就把牠頂在頭上。然而鑽到桌子底下去。若是在操塲，則分散開，再用手把身朶和眼睛堵上，這就是正式的方法。</p>
<p>藤田：用手堵　？</p>
<p>岡田：當然用手堵了。因爲振破耳膜，或碰傷眼睛就不得了，所以要用手這樣作。這用不着很大的工作，一堵後，馬上就拿下來去救火。</p>
<p>藤田：道是下命令以後這樣作麼！</p>
<p>岡田：當瞭望臺喊出「敵機飛臨市空」時，就這樣作。這是由於國民小學的兒童當發出空襲警報時就不能回家了，且若兩個鐘頭或三個鐘頭在外面躱警報，父母也非常擔心，所以這樣訓練，完全是適當的辦法。或者是一部份勸回家去，若不這樣作有時按道理也不，行。尤其日本人特別愛護兒童若是兒童負了傷，則仍然會使人心非常動搖的。</p>
<p>藤田：兒童的事情是最不好辦的。</p>
<p>岡田：是眞不好辦，大人負傷後並不像兒童那樣影響人心，所以必須替兒童想出一種妥善的躱避方法。</p>

<h3>法屬越南全貌（五）</h3>
<p>— 越人</p>
<p>（四）法殖民地的真珠</p>
<p>越南是「法蘭西殖民地的眞珠」，這是法國一向所誇耀的。試一研究法國所有殖民地，在美洲早已失去法國的原有的地盤，菲洲方面，可謂「法蘭西殖民地世界」了，但究竟多長些不毛之地。其中資源最　的要算越南！</p>
<p>越南的產業，首先要提到的是以米占第一位的豐富的農業，近年來鑛業也有些　達，此外林產業和水產業也不容忽視。從經濟的見地，產業地區的分布如下：</p>
<p>（一）西貢地區：指交趾支那，柬埔寨，老撾南部及安南法里拉以南地區，除了沿海岸及南部　沼地的漁業之外，全部是　業區，爲世界最大產米地之一。</p>
<p>（二）海防地區：指東京保護國及安南國的北部，主要是農業，鑛業及製造業。</p>
<p>（三）安南中部地區，自順安至法里拉角，主要爲農業地帶，而從土倫　輸出肉桂，砂糖，茶，玉蜀黍，等，惟米產較少，</p>
<p>從越南輸出額的百分之七十爲農產物一點，可知農業在載南產業上的地位了。而農產的大部分是土人以傳統方法也就是中國生產方法生產的米，烟草，棉，桑等。此外，有歐人經營的近代企業如橡膠，咖啡，茶等。土產中尙有玉蜀黍，荳，大豆，藷芋，粟，胡麻，落花生，蔬菜，生菓，胡椒，肉桂，白豆蔲，大茴香，罌粟，藥醬，檳榔，糖蔗，椰子，古加，木棉，麻，苧蔴，漆，藍，薑黃等等，近代企業的農作物，尙有東京之玉蜀黍，甘蔗，菎蔴，油桐，麻，交趾支那的米，胡椒，油椰子，柬埔棄的米，老撾的奎寗等。</p>
<p>森林面積幾占越南全域的百分之五十七，尤其是湄公河上游地城，　於麻栗及一般木材，但至今尙多沒有開發。茲表示其情形如下：（單位千萬公里）</p>
<p>蓄積豐富之森林　六〇〇</p>
<p>蓄積中等之森林　一四、〇〇〇</p>
<p>蓄積豐富之草原　一二、三〇〇</p>
<p>蓄積中等之草原　一四〇</p>
<p>計　四二、四四〇</p>
<p>其中麻栗樹（滴於造船建築之用）以老撾即湄公河上游沿岸特別豐富，每年產額二萬至一萬公尺，沿河而下，至西貢轉向印度，香港，法國，英國，新加坡等地輸出。以外是火柴用的柔軟木材，也有大量生產。竹爲土人重要建築用村及家具用材，籐在安南及東京特別豐富，輸向香港及中國南部各省，爲地方重要財源。木，炭，則由華僑及土人經營，自西貢等地向泰國香港等處輸出。</p>
<p>越南三面臨海，而國內又有長江大湖，所以水產非常豐富，爲農村一大副業。可分海洋及淡水兩項，（一）海水漁業，全要的有（甲）東京沿岸，以阿龍灣爲中心，中國漁人占有優勢，從北海及海南島前往，漁獲物多銷於海防市塲。（乙）安南沿岸，北部爲中心，漁夫及從事水產物加工業者約三萬人，女子從業者亦約三萬人，漁船約三千。（丙）南圻沿岸，以東海岸及暹羅灣爲中心，海夫多爲華僑及土人。（丁）柬埔寨沿岸，安南漁人約三千，華僑出資辦水產業加工業，有許多一千至四千法郞的小工廠。（二）淡水漁業，因富于河川湖沿，雖漁法幼稚，而仍極發達，最盛爲柬埔寨，以水準最低時三千平方公里的太湖爲天然的養魚池。</p>
<p>海淡漁麻物的輸出，有逐年增加之勢，輸向地爲新加坡（七一％），香港（一二％）及中國泰國等。</p>
<p>農業由越南輸出數的七〇％爲食品，這是法國統治所造成的最顯著的結果之一。他們對越南的政策，自始即以造成農業原料國以滿足本國工業發展爲第一要旨。但是，就在農業方面，也絕對沒有促其現代化，盡力維持其原始式的農業生產方法，因此，農林漁牧各業，都還停滯在原始經濟階段。農民們過着痛苦的生活。</p>
<p>其次越南重要資源是鑛產，特別以無烟煤之品質良好與埋藏量豐富著名。現在比較的大規模生產的有煤，錫，　，金和亞鉛，此外也有鐵，銻，燐酸鹽，實石，凍石等也有開發。</p>
<p>燃料鑛物即各種煤鑛，在越南產業略　重要地位，以東京爲中心地，而東京又以供給無烟煤及褐煤爲主。無烟煤一名鴻基煤僅阿龍灣沿岸董丘附近即有無烟煤鑛九處，瀝靑及褐煤鑛各二，年產額爲二百萬噸內外。一九三九年的輸出額爲一百五十七噸，九百九十萬越元，大部份銷給日本，中國與菲律賓，泰國，新加坡，香港等。</p>
<p>主要金屬礦物有亞鉛與錫。錫鑛以東京及老撾著名，前者由東京錫公司及華爾福拉姆公司開發，後者則爲越南鑛業查採公司。海防設有錫鑛精鍊公司，百分之九九輸向新加坡，餘銷法本國及香港。</p>
<p>此外鎢靡產三百二十七公鐓（一九三八），金三百十二公斤（一九三七），鐵七萬二千公鐓（一九三八），銻四十七公鐓（一九三六）憐酸鹽四萬三千公鐓（一九三八），至於鉛，銀，陸砂，凍石，石棉，寶石等，沒有正式統計。</p>
<p>可是，由於法國實行本國保護政策的結果，雖然法國人之經營者也不少，而實際產量和質量都未達應有水準。豐富的資料，還在棄置於原野的狀態，這不能不說是法國企業家對於越南開發事業缺少積極心，而法國本國　來處境之　難自然也是極重要的原因。（完）</p>

<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>上海地區內重要物資移動許可制撤廢後，一切物資之使用，製造，販賣，槪歸去春成立之中日各業同業公會及旣存組合與公會自治統制，爲使各該公會之統制機構健全起見，刻下各關係當局正在研究具體辦法之中，至遲在下週中有妥善辦法可定。（三月二十一日大陸新報）</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>新政策與經濟人的責任</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，已經呱呱　地。中國方面自洽的經濟統制，從此可以逐步進展，預料它的統制系統，必能更進一步的成功。但是一方面我們又連想起中國經濟人的責任也愈益重大，這次能够　民間經濟人自治的統制來確立戰時經濟，解决戰時的民生問題，中日當局相信中國經濟界人士的識見和力量，有道樣賢明的英斷，都是值得贊揚的。</p>
<p>中國的經濟人，也須體會中日兩當局的意旨，適應軍事和民生的需求，期有萬全的成就。這就是中國經濟人的責任，統制總會的運用，也應該從這個觀點來着手做去，這些事情是中國的有識人士，尤其是一般富有識見的經濟人所熟知的。不過在財政界的一部份人士之中，不徹底認識而認爲行之過早，或抱誤解的，也不在少數。有的把新政策認爲是接近自由主義經濟的現象，有的認爲是恢復大東亞戰前狀態的先聲，有的認爲是統制主義的反動，這樣荒謬不經的錯覺，充斥在一般商人之間。所以目前的重大問題，就是要把這種謬見錯覺驅出經濟界，使大衆認識新政策的本質與其方向，以及中日兩當局的眞意。</p>
<p>新政策的目標，在於如何達到有關中國經濟的軍事上需求，同時如何來合理解決民生問題。應該注意採用自治統制方法，是最有效而最合理的辦法。要是能够認淸這種事實，關於新政策的一切誤解，自然會烟散雲消了，同時各合辦公司和日方合作的躊躇傾向，也能解消。中國經濟人須要明白唯有和日方合作，才能根本解決戰時經濟問題和民生問題。</p>
<p>因新政策的實踐，中日民間的合作可能性，也隨之增大。眞正的合作，平等的條件，才能實現。</p>
<p>日本方面的經濟人，趁新政策實現的機會，預備放棄一切特權，這是首先表示合作的熱忱象徵。日本經濟人現在正盡最大的努力來適應新政策，假使中國方面曲解其事實，爲謠言所惑，則將來不免抱憾。同時日方亦應從大局着想，努力實現民間合作，來完成推進大東亞戰爭的後方任務。（雲鵬：譯自三月二十日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>各同業公會遵令　辦理存貨登記</h3>

<h3>全國商業統制總會議決　市區以內物資移動要案</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　全國商業統制總會，於前（二十）日舉行理鹽事臨時聯席會議，討論市區以內物資移動問題及非統制物資輸出輸入問題，經實業部袁次長蒞會指示，已得相當解決。該會組織伊始，工作異常緊張，昨（二十一）日雖屬星期日，各負責人員仍照常辦公，唐理事長幷召集秘書長秘書及各該主管人員，開會討論一切工作進行問題。聞該會在下星期內，即可遷入愛文義跢九八四號房屋辦公云。茲將該會對於理監會議議決物資移運各項要案電陳實業部全文錄后</p>
<p>上實業部電文</p>
<p>南京實業部梅部長鈞鑒，本日本會召開　監事臨時聯席會議，因物資移運事項關係重大，特請大部袁次長蒞會指導，茲將該項有關提案及決議列舉如次：（一）根據政府所頒取締條例，嗣後上海市內一切物資均可自由移動，究應如何辦理案。（二）據一部份同業公會函稱，自物資停止移動後，有不在統制之物資亦被禁止移動，函請救濟，以解商困，應如何辦理案，兩案決議：上海區內物資移動，除取締條例所規定者須待登記完畢通知後，方可移動外，其餘物資，均准自由移動，關係方面請實業部通知。（三）移出人物資除取締條例規定，應經本會許可者外，應如何辦理案。本案決議：取締條例規定以外之物資，其輪出入之申請在政府未另頒辦法以前，本會暫不處理。（四）取締條例規定須經本會許可方得移出移入，各項物資其出入數量，應如何核定案。本案決議：（甲）在新辦法未經物資統制審議會議定由實業部發交本會以前，暫按原有辦法處理。（乙）在本會組織未全部完成前，由實業部派員用本會許可印章，代爲處理，特先陳報，即祈齣　備案。幷請電知各關係機關分別照辦，本會亦擬即日正式發表，以便商民。至其他各案，當照章彙報，全國商業統制總會理事長唐壽民叩　。」</p>
<h3>生活必需品的動態</h3>
<p>上海自組織商業統制總會後，物資統制漸次加强，食糖，木炭，已從十一日起開始計口授給制，今後對於一切安定民生的必需物資，漸漸地加强統制，這裏就來分類的解釋一下民生物資的統制狀况。</p>
<p>香烟</p>
<p>香烟的統制，開始到現在，已有三年多，但是還說不上最完善狀態，其間也曾改革過種種機構，不過都是失敗了。去年底解散了過去的統制機關中支那烟草配給組合，另設中日合辦的華中烟草配給組合，糾正了過去統制上的缺點，今後的合理統制，是極有希望的。按中支那烟草配給組台，創立於昭和十五年十月，它的任務是在於防止香烟的流入敵區，同時調節上海和內地間的　銷及價格。</p>
<p>但是大東亞戰爭突發後，向歸英美包辦的烟業，就轉到了日方管理之下，歸中支那烟草配給組合來統制經營，華商方面仍舊委託從前的總代理永泰和承辦，日本方面由烟草小賣同業組合管理門市零售事宜，又因爲經濟情勢的轉變，亟需生產事菜的合作，就實現了中日烟商的合併。</p>
<p>去年一月創立中華烟革公司吸收合併東洋葉烟草，東亞烟革，興亞烟草，華北烟草，武漢華成烟草六大日商香烟公司。華商方面也設立了　商烟草組合辦事處，負責統制產銷，商定價格，共同收買原料。</p>
<p>產銷方面雖然有了道樣的組織，可是銷路狀况，依然混亂，黑市不絕，此蓋由於產銷兩方的不能完余取得聯繫之故，同時華商方面的販賣統制不能澈底也是原因之一。日本方面雖然極力維持公定價格，但反造成租界方面的投機劉象，在漲不已。</p>
<p>上面這種現狀，當然不能任其蔓延開去，爲了確立產銷的一貫統制機構，維持公定價格起見，所以去年十二月解散了中支那烟草配給組合，由中日合辦另設華中烟革配給組合，通盤計劃一切產銷事宜。</p>
<p>還有一點爲大家所關心的，就是華商烟行太多，究將整理收縮到何種程度。原因是這樣的，假使小能貫撤統制這些烟行，那末，烟業　新秩序恐怕是沒有希望的，華中烟草配給組合方面，預備把它整理，收縮到現在數量的三分之二。</p>

<h3>回響去吧！</h3>
<p>— 何人</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我是被遣還鄉了。</p>
<p>筋疲骨酸的操作，陰　異臭的氣息，在我也是不可再得的奢望了。動盪不安的大局，與食糧難得的現况，也決定了我底命運。業主對我說：「你巳沒有在此的必要，回鄕去吧！」</p>
<p>三年來辛勤的學習，如此的下塲！我已截去了兩指，是十指不全的人了！我該是帶着可怖的殘手，辛酸地回去見家鄉的人麼？</p>
<p>我還　得第一次進廠的情形。同鄉而又是父執的練先生，那時是廠裏的跑街。他領了我進廠，路上嘮叨地吿訴我許多廠裏的規矩，我似懂非懂地聽着；看了那灰白鬍子的下巴，一上一下嘴裏好像有一樣東西在打滾，唾沫四濺那副神態，覺得很好笑。可是一句話却進了我的心　，我至今還記得</p>
<p>「阿奎，你已不是孩子了。到了那地方，你得好好兒學，你一生的事業，都在此吶！」</p>
<p>我已不是一個孩子了！雖然還年輕。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>拜師禮過後，廠主（也使是業師），叫過一偭人來說：「禾成，你帶他到機械間裏去，別欺侮他！」那是比我大一歲的孩子，也是學徒，淸瘦而靈活。據他告訴我，業帥是難得進機房的，而且也不會動手，學徒須實習而自通呢。</p>
<p>廠裏分電筒與電池兩部，電筒部裏有六個工友，專製筒身與零件，裝燈則另有人承包。電池部內有工程師一名，和助手兩人，也便是他底學生，專助他處理化學上的事務，此外的工作，便都由女工擔仟。她們都是按天計工，並不宿在廠裏。廠中學徒，連我共計四名，盡是年歲彷彿的孩子；禾成算是資格最老的一個。小胖子元和，和「油條」何春在樓上電池部服役，禾成與我則在樓下機器間裏。阿春最喜與別人代購油條，因而獲得那個奇怪的渾名。（這也象徵着他底瘦長的身子呢！）</p>
<p>由於口音的特殊，他們見我發言就大笑，有時還故意叫我說幾個拗口的字。不久，我便也有了渾名，叫「小江北」</p>
<p>機器的數量很小少，我到後來才辨識得什麼車床，鉋床，鉗床，之類。鉅大的輪盤被皮帶牽着，循環不息地只是轉旋，發着「胡胡」的吼聲，間歇地雜以機器打擊的聲昔；「白達曰達」，又淸脆，又迅速。我看見有幾隻烏黑粗糙的手，在機模間活動，上模打下來，手離開下模，上模彈回去，手又塞上一瑰銅片到模裏來。於是打過印的銅皮一塊一塊從模後傾瀉下去，收聚在筐裏。禾成告訴我，要是上模打着手指，準得打爛成餅；我不禁爲之揑一把汗。但是看那些工友從容自在的樣子，還有興緻與鄰人挿科打　，不由不爲之驚異·手上好如生眼睛般地。</p>
<p>起先我只做些簡易的工作；傳遞器械，收集碎料，檢點數目，有時也替工友們買買香烟，替「小開」沽酒，或購買另物，——他是廠長的姪子，也便是廠內最高的職員，管賬並兼監工，人家都稱他「小開」。——這些據說也必須學習</p>
<p>漸漸地我也能握剪刀，執鉗子了。禾成說，一切都得自己試習，沒有人來敎授的。因此此我樣樣都想親試一下，看他們與機器所合作的玩意兒，是那麼純熱，習慣，不由我不羨慕。剪刀車上的人去小便了，，我就乘空上去代理；這倒並不難，只要把銅皮或鐵片比齊了樣尺，一踏就得。看！我也照樣來得，只是踏得慢此吧了。那人回來了，倒並不怪我，把我踏過的東西，看了看說：「你高興踏，就替我踏吧。」於是我便替他工作，直踏到腿酸叫苦，他却在一旁吸烟微笑。</p>
<p>禾成比我能幹得多，他已什麼都可替得，除了修理機模外；（那自然是機匠底本務。）他有一次叫我試踏模子，我怕軋壞手指，他笑我怯，吿訴我先把手離開模間。才用脚踏，原理是和剪刀車彷彿的。我試着慢慢地做，果然不錯。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>陡地時局變了，外路斷了，廠裏的出品不能出銷外埠，就只能縮小範圍。單靠本埠老實說，電筒廠很雞立足。漸漸地工人遣散，電筒部停工；接着工程師辭去，電池部也歇業。廠裏於是只剩了我們幾個學徒，淸靜得緊。</p>
<p>不久廠裏改變了方針，製造別針；因爲它有銷路。廠長腦筋很會動，只要聽說有利可獲，他就幹。說來倒也很冠冕的，他藉口要維持工友們的生計；可是實際却苦了我們學徒，因爲所添的工友並不多，學徒倒被派足了用塲：什麼都得做，日夜不間歇。</p>
<p>幸運的是在這忽忙辛苦中，我學到了不少。「小開」已不　我底工作不行，只催我還要故得央。</p>
<p>兩個月不到，別針銷路轉狹，廠裏便改製銅扣子；那就是小電珠（小燈泡）的頸部。因爲定貨的踴躍，又開起日夜工來。因而我底厄運也便來了。</p>
<p>銅扣子，那種圓柱式的小東西，是須一個個地從車上打出來的。那東西成形後，又須一個一個扶在模上打綫紋，手便不時須在模間進出逃生。兼之，因爲劇烈的震動，模子時常會壞，忽而上模打不下去，忽而又上下模咬住在一起，彈上不來。</p>
<p>廠裏爲　節省開支，只用了兩位老司務，我們是沒有薪金的，可是，無論剪裁，踏車，整理，大多數工作都是我們做的，兩位司務底主責不過在修理模子，指點指點。所以我們都辛苦得透不過氣來，他們郤有閑談笑。</p>
<p>一次，我踏的那部車壞了，兩位司務又不在。那上模好容易抬了上去，却踏不下來。我看看禾成，他在我右旁，郤很順利地在踏，只見他扣子一個一個地在車後滑入筐裏。我乾咳了一聲，拚命用力一踏，郤忘了將手拿出，上模陡的落下來，我只逃出了右手，痛得我暈了過去，只聽得耳邊一聲嘈雜，以後便什麼也不知了。</p>
<p>我漸漸恢復知覺，發覺已在勞工醫院中，禾成陪着我。</p>
<p>醫生對我說：「你左手底食指與拇指，不過短了一節，沒有關係。」沒有關係麼？我已是殘廢的人了！</p>
<p>躺在擱樓上的時候，惟有禾成不時抽暇來安慰我。</p>
<p>「幹嗎傷心？「禾成見我儘是愁眉不展的，勸解地問道。</p>
<p>「還有比殘廢更可恨的嗎？叫我怎好見人去？」</p>
<p>「學手藝如我們這般的，軋掉幾個手指，也是尋常的事。不見傷的，就不算老司務。」禾成故意慰解道。接着又吿訴我幾個熟知的機械匠，都是小指不全的人。</p>
<p>傷處漸漸平復，新生的皮膚包攏來，宛如兩僩和尙頭，圓而且滑。短了的兩節，再也生不出來。</p>
<p>時間眞是痛苦的安慰者，漸漸我那種悔恨的心理，已不如往昔那麼强烈，雖然看見了那兩個光頭，仍叫我不好過。</p>
<p>毀了就毀了，我只得巴望將來，不久的將來，成爲卓越的機匠；瞧吧，那殘指的疤痕，便是成功的標記哩！我只能如此想。於是我又以一顆火熱的心，浸潛在工作中。</p>
<p>可是廠的歇業，不啻一聲當頭的霹靂，把我僅有的一絲希望也給打碎了。我該恨誰呢？「這是你終身的事業，得好好兒學習！」蒼老的聲音猶在耳畔。</p>
<p>回鄕去吧。我底運命該不在上海。</p>
<h3>我更瘦了</h3>
<p>— 翁</p>
<p>時針正指在六字上，同事們都已陸績地回家去了，最後應該是輪到我了。</p>
<p>把各事安排定了以後，我便拖着疲乏的身子，走上我回家之路。午餐時吃的三碗稀飯，早已在胃裏消化盡了：路上看見又香又脆的餅，但是囊空如洗，身無分文的我，祗能嚥一口唾吐，旋轉頭繼續向前走。</p>
<p>「×先生！」一個熟悉的聲音，打我身後傳來，我夢醒似地，把頭回轉，向後一看，原來是一個我的學生。</p>
<p>「×先生！好嗎？」他走上來向我說。</p>
<p>我勉强地把皺着的眉頭放開，苦笑了一下，點了點頭回答道：「還好。」</p>
<p>還好？好些什麼？這問題在我心裏旋轉着，我竟一時想不起有些什麼好。</p>
<p>「您這學期仍舊在那個學校裏嗎？」他繼續和我談下去</p>
<p>誰知我肚裏的胃在叫了。</p>
<p>『是的，」我無力地答覆他一聲。</p>
<p>「我現在考進××中學了、，他們的學費眞便宜，祇抵你們的一半，你們學費這樣貴，誰上得起你們的學校。而且……」</p>
<p>「——」我對他望望。</p>
<p>「×先生，一個多月沒有看見愈了，您怎樣更瘦了？」他忽然想起這話來了。</p>
<p>「——」我沒有說話。</p>
<p>「有病嗎？×先生」，他再追問我。</p>
<p>瘦！是的我瘦了，比去年更瘦了。是病了嗎？不，沒有病，身體還很好哩，但是怎麼會瘦呢？我不知道。</p>
<p>「不，沒有病，」我說，一面搖搖頭，「大概頭髮長了些，更顯得我瘦了。」</p>
<p>肚千裏嘰嘰咕咕鬧個不停，我便接着說：</p>
<p>「時候不早了，我們再見吧，有空的時候，到我們校裏來玩玩。</p>
<p>「再會，×先生！」說罷，他鞠了一個躬。</p>
<p>我們分別了。</p>
<p>到了家，妻把粥預　好叫我吃，我很快地喝了三碗像水樣的薄粥。</p>
<p>食畢，我呆呆地躺在床上，妻繼續她的女紅。</p>
<p>「校裏今天發新了沒有？」她突然問我這個問題。</p>
<p>「沒有！」我有氣無力地說。</p>
<p>「今天是月底，怎麼還不發薪？」</p>
<p>「——」</p>
<p>「米一粒也沒有了，明天吃什麼？」</p>
<p>「你明天不能去算工錢嗎？算了工錢來，去買些玉米來煮點粥吃好了，」我說。</p>
<p>「工錢早已算過了，手裏的活沒有了，怎樣能再去算工錢呢？」</p>
<p>我沒有話說了。祗是把兩條眉毛緊緊地連接着。</p>
<p>「您怎樣更瘦了」？剛　略上遇到的學生的問話，又浮在我腦海裏了。</p>
<p>瘦了，確實比去年瘦得多了。上學期剛開學的時候，我們夫妻倆，用辛勤換來的一點收入，還可以混口飯吃吃；近來却漸漸地不行了，物價漫無止境地飛漲，而收入却沒有跟着漲，祇是那麼一點。，結果遺幾個月來，弄得連飯都吃不成了，天天吃粥，粥也漸漸地變薄了。</p>
<p>又是一個學期了。學費已經加了倍，薪水不知能不能加倍，即便加了倍够不够還是一個問題；兼之妻的肚子又偏不肯掙氣，眼望它一天天澎大起來，屈指算來，離孩子出世的日子上已不遠了；再有身上的衣服，已破得幾乎不能再穿了</p>
<p>這一聯串的思想，在我的腦海中翻來覆去，　我沒有方法分析它們。</p>
<p>「唉！生了孩子將怎樣辦」？妻停了一晌，看我不發一言，便先打開話匣子。</p>
<p>我躺在床上，始終不作聲，凝視着吊在天花板上的電燈，忽而燈光漸漸地暗了，我看不淸燈，眼睛也濕了，淚水開始汨汨而出，經過面頰滴在枕頭上。</p>
<p>妻要生產，家中沒有年老的婦人，可以幫助和指導，當然是進醫院，比較安全得多，但是醫院裏的費用在哪兒。</p>
<p>「你夏天的長衫，已經破得不像樣了，補也沒有辦法補了，再也不能穿了，做新的嗎？」他看我不說話，就換句話來說。</p>
<p>「當　囉，說罷，繼續保持我的沉默，心裏祇是在打算着。</p>
<p>長衫是不可少的，尤其對於敎師，是更不可少的。</p>
<p>左思右想，始終想不出一個解決這問題的方法。</p>
<p>一不想了！脫了衣服睡覺吧！等明天再說吧！」</p>
<p>我自言自語地說着，一面脫衣睡覺。</p>
<h3>春憶</h3>
<p>— 沙雲</p>
<p>偶然的憶起淺春的香，這香裏有我故鄕銅橋邊的蘿蔔味；我是怕想起故鄉的春的，因爲我恐在睡夢　又看見了</p>
<p>母親的慈愛的眼睛。古牆上田野間的滿天風箏，媽呀你又在太陽脚下，籬笆邊跟理妹話着一個悲壯的故事。春夜裏我是還辨別得出母親的笑的，今夜是好月亮，媽呀你正緬懷着古廟裏靜穆的鐘聲？</p>
<h3>色的禮讃</h3>
<p>— 赫文</p>
<p>在這個字宙中，每一種顏色都有着它的力量，正如詩人們所說：「色是能視，能嗅，能嘗，能聽的東西！」</p>
<p>唯美派的詩人們非但能在白色中找尋純潔與光明，黑色裏感覺到悲哀和苦痛，他們更會從白色中聽到豎琴聲，黃色裏發現笛聲，而瞧見了黑色，眼前就好似有無數的鋼琴的鍵子在跳動。</p>
<p>若你不是色盲者，你的生活至少有一點會受着色素的影響，各種美麗或混雜的顏色，能够支配你的心情，甚至你的　魂；它能給你快樂，但也能使你悲哀，失望！</p>
<p>一個近垂暮年的悲觀者吿訴人家：在他所處的環境內，眼前老是一片死沉沉的灰白色：蒼白的臉，灰白的髮，白聖的四壁，茫茫的灰色原野，灰白的光芒……於是周圍的一切都染上灰白色了，凄黯的白便成了他的憂　的成因。</p>
<p>當囚徒們被送人一個黑黝的牢獄裏，他們會認爲整個的世界都黑黯，他們的心，也就益漸冷酷而糢糊起來。</p>
<p>有許多俗不可耐的彩色往往會染汚了人們的靈魂，產生一切的罪行。鮮艷的美麗奪目的顏色在蕩漾着，紅亮的燈，碧綠的酒，含着妖媚氣味的淺紅的胭脂，以及夢想中的澄黃的金色，閃閃的銀白色……眩惑了人們朦朧的眼，蒙蔽了他們的理智……於是他們不惜損害別人，斷送未來的日子，儘量地追求濃烈的彩色，追求無止盡的慾望的滿足，追求罪惡……</p>
<p>年靑的人墮落了，年老的人絕望了，犯罪的人不知懺悔，頹廢的人摧殘自己，這都是山於色的誘惑，色的刺激，色的束縛。</p>
<p>有人愛在彩色中找尋生命的力量，燦爛的金黃色的晨光，使人們更寳貴自己的靑春，在色彩鮮明的旗幟下，誰都會奮發，振作；天藍色的服裝，使人們感到莊嚴；髹漆着金色朱色的宮殿，使人們覺得堂皇，而彩色的畫，綺麗的美術品，又給予我們能進一步認識人類的藝術的創造力！</p>
<p>世界上全仗着色的旋律，色的調合，帶來了進步，人類中也　了色的和勻，色的跳躍，帶來了溫存和熱情！</p>
<p>我們需要純潔的色素，那就是眞與美的顏色，人們都愛欣賞大自然中的種種彩色，是多麼淳樸，雅淡，而絲毫沒有一點虛僞的渲染！</p>
<p>蔚藍的天際，蒼蒼的白雲，靑的山，綠的水，都像處女一般聖潔。紫色的葡萄，乳白的丁香，淺紅的玫瑰，，固然是宇宙間的特色，就是靑色的草原，金黃色的麥田，也同樣有令人可愛之處。面對着字宙的美色，誰都願意捨棄一初的奢望，向一個樸實的世界中去尋求。</p>
<p>字宙中的色素，是配合得那麼適當，從不會有舛錯和破綻，而且更能啟發欣賞者，愛慕者的智慧，爲什什麼黑羽的燕子有一個紅嘴，爲什麼在嫩綠的葉子裏能抽出紅色的花朶，這都是平凡與不平凡之間的問題。</p>
<p>其實，大自然內的一切，何曾含着神秘，你得去仔細地察看，耐心地思索，總會給你種種新的啓示。</p>
<p>色的變化支配着世間的一切，色的跳動掌握了人類的運命！</p>
<p>每個人都有着嗜好的顏色，來代表他們的人格與性情，工愁的女子整年穿着素色的衣服，貪利的大腹賈也貪愛紫醬色，險惡的人往往喜歡灰黑色，勇敢的人追求鮮明的紅色，正直的人愛好白色。</p>
<p>年靑的人所需要的顏色，與年老的人絕對不同，靑年人能在彩色中找到活力與生命，老年人却將接觸到的色素和淺泊的心境融和了！</p>
<p>我說：每個人的生命，也會反映出一種色彩來，有的人生是紅的，藍的，也有是灰的，黃的，白的，黑的……</p>
<p>我們的生活中少不了各種色素，但是，過分貪戀濃郁的彩色，曾嚐到世問的厭膩，而失去了眞正的人生的滋味。不需要一點色彩，會陷入枯寂空虛的日子裏！無法了解人生的眞諦。唯有知道配合調節純潔的色素者，始有一個充實的人生！</p>
<p>因爲有了各種的色素，我們才不在一　單調的世界中生活！</p>
<p>編者的話</p>
<p>我們不取文言的稿子，這大概是不用說明的吧，希望有兩篇寫得相當好的文言稿子，也有牠們的去處。</p>

<h3>Participation in the War: Politics and Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's commentary briefly discussed the important relationship between participating in the war and national reconstruction and industrial development, as well as the expectations of the people. We believe that participating in the war and national reconstruction and industrial development should complement and promote each other. However, whether it is participating in the war, national reconstruction, or industrial development, the outcome depends on the success of political and diplomatic policies. Since joining the war, in less than three months, in terms of politics, there has been the realization of a wartime system, and in terms of diplomacy, there has been the beginning of Japan's new policy towards China. Standing in the position of the people, our expectations for the government are extremely earnest. We dare to continue discussing politics and diplomacy after participating in the war, national reconstruction, and industrial development.</p>
<p>The scope of politics is extremely broad, and the most important issue is the national system. Although China's five-thousand-year history has many brilliant achievements, due to the long-term autocratic monarchy system, the world was for personal gain, and there were very few days of political brightness, with longer periods of darkness. There were minor disturbances every few decades and major disturbances every few centuries, recurring endlessly. Although ancient sages and wise men created valuable culture, it often could not be inherited, promoted, and developed. Especially since the Song Dynasty, cultural progress has stagnated, and the people's physical strength has declined day by day. Investigating the reason, it is due to the "family owns the country" relationship. The people have no status or power, and they are at the mercy of the rulers' command and servitude and cannot strive for themselves. As a result, man-made disasters and natural calamities frequently occur, and the country's affairs become increasingly wrong. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the autocratic system that had been passed down for thousands of years, and the Chinese nation saw the light of day. However, because autocracy had lasted for too long, political malpractices had accumulated too deeply, and social customs were too bad, it was not easy to reveal the ideal light in this historical transformation work in a short period of time. Subsequently, after the Sino-Japanese Incident, public opinion diverged, worries and difficulties followed, and the country faced the danger of division, and the people suffered from displacement. Fortunately, around the return of the capital, thanks to the efforts of the leaders of both China and Japan, the provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast were able to celebrate their recovery. Now, due to participating in the war, the international status has been elevated, and the wartime political system has a new atmosphere of starting anew with the people. If we can take this opportunity to reform politics and innovate the political atmosphere, we can complete the unfinished achievements since the Xinhai Revolution and establish a permanent foundation for the Republic of China. We pray that contemporary politicians will, based on the vision of the new world order, strive to awaken the people, organize the people, and improve the grassroots political institutions, so that everyone knows that the country is lovable and the government is respectable. The benefits are that, in the short term, the people's strength can be concentrated, and the country can be sound; and in the long term, the establishment of permanent peace in East Asia can also be initiated from this.</p>
<p>However, there is no need to avoid the truth. In this new era, China's politics is no longer a matter of one country, but has an inseparable relationship with the fate of the entire East Asia; and the relationship between China and Japan sharing weal and woe is particularly close. Since participating in the war, Japan's policy towards us has undergone a great and bright change, and all the manifestations are exciting. In this new era, our country's foreign policy should increase confidence, and whether now or in the future, we should strive together with friendly countries that have the same national policy as ours. However, our country has become a place of contention for the great powers for a hundred years and has long been trapped in a semi-colonial state. For the sake of permanent peace in East Asia, there must be a strong China to be able to cooperate with friendly countries to permanently maintain the stability of East Asia. Today, the starting point of the new policy of friendly countries should be nothing more than this. At the same time, because our country has been poor and weak for many years, there is also a sense of national inferiority. People may still use traditional eyes to evaluate the actions of foreigners in China and feel uneasy. If this subtle psychological awareness is allowed to lie dormant and grow, it will also lead to unfortunate misunderstandings. We believe that Chinese citizens should strengthen their self-confidence and hope that people of friendly countries will thoroughly understand that China is a nation of integrity and peace and will never hinder the legitimate interests of others. Therefore, our foreign policy must create an independent and free modern country. All those who sympathize with and support us are friends, and we must be harmonious and friendly with them and remain unwavering. After obtaining this equality, we will never be selfish with our strength, but will make good use of our human resources and cooperate with friendly countries that share weal and woe to strive forward and do our best to establish a new order of permanent peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>Development of the National Government's Economic Policy</h3>
<p>Taking China's participation in the war as an opportunity, the Japanese government has implemented a transformation of its policy towards China. In order to achieve the goal of establishing China's autonomy and independence, it has decided to return concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights, entrust the responsibility of maintaining law and order, and restrict the interference of special agencies in administration, and it has already stated this. Its actions are nothing more than hoping that China can become self-reliant and strong and then share the responsibility of carrying out the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In response to this policy transformation of Japan, China has resolutely implemented the reform and establishment of its various policies. For the economic policy, which is considered the most urgent, it has first reorganized the National Economic Commission into an agency directly under the National Government, increased the number of members, and accommodated influential figures in the financial community, using it as the highest agency, as the economic center, and as a new starting point for China's economic policy under participation in the war.</p>
<p>The outline of the wartime economic policy announced by the Supreme National Defense Council is its initial undertaking and is the basis for the National Government's economic policy in the future, so it must be given importance. This outline is divided into five items: increasing production, adjusting prices, saving consumption, stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, and transforming economic institutions. The item of increasing production concerns increasing the productivity of agriculture, industry, and mining, so it stipulates the securing of raw materials and fuels, the guarantee of profits, etc.; the item of adjusting prices stipulates the improvement of transportation institutions, the adjustment of distribution institutions, and the crackdown on hoarding; the item of saving consumption stipulates the increase in the production of substitutes and the restriction of the production of non-essential goods and luxury goods; the item of currency and finance stipulates the improvement of financial institutions with reserve certificates as the center, the encouragement of savings, the restoration of agricultural, industrial, and mining financial institutions, and the prohibition of speculation; and the item of transforming economic institutions stipulates the reorganization of economic institutions, the establishment of a consistent institution from production to distribution, and the implementation of a group management system. The characteristic of this outline is that it grasps the key points of China's current urgent problems, but the question is how to implement this outline. Based on the above basic outline, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National General Association of Commercial Control on the 11th of this month. The regulations stipulate that a control association shall be established for each type of commodity, and a general association of control shall be established in Shanghai to lead them. A Japan-China joint material control deliberation council shall also be established as an advisory body. Under the supervision of the National Government, the control association shall, by means of autonomous control by the people, carry out the purchase and distribution of controlled materials and the supply and distribution of imported materials. According to the talk of Minister of Industry Mei, the control association has the characteristics of implementing the separation of politics and economics and transitioning from government control to civil autonomous control.</p>
<p>Promulgated at the same time as these regulations was the Provisional Regulation for the Control of Wartime Material Movement. The movement of materials in Central China has long been implemented by the Japanese side, such as the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Material Movement in Military-Occupied Areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (promulgated in September of the 30th year of the Republic of China), the Regulations for the Restriction of Material Movement in and out of the Shanghai Area, and the Regulations for Material Movement in the Qingxiang Area, etc. However, due to the newly promulgated regulations on material movement control by the National Government, most of the above-mentioned regulations on the Yangtze River area were abolished, and other restrictive regulations based on these regulations, as well as restrictions on material movement in the Qingxiang area, etc., were also abolished. Therefore, the control of material movement in peaceful areas has become much freer than before. The current shortage of materials in Central China, which is facing national difficulties, can be supplemented by the promotion of movement due to the effect of these two regulations. In terms of material collection and distribution, it can be said to be a historical reform since the incident.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is that, according to the announcement of the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank's funds will be used to establish a new Central Savings Association, which will plan to issue three new types of bonds: economic recovery lottery bonds, installment savings bonds, and prize-winning principal repayment bonds. This method is one of the means of implementing the policy outline on encouraging savings. In order to adjust the imbalance between currency and materials, which has become a problem in Central China, it is necessary to absorb the surplus purchasing power in any case. These savings bonds and the grain warehouse bonds, which are expected to be issued soon, can be considered to have a major task in the reflux of currency, so this is another new policy worthy of attention.</p>
<p>From the 10th of this month, new Qingxiang work will begin in the Zhenjiang area, and soon the Qingxiang work in northern Jiangsu will also begin. These Qingxiang works are different from those previously carried out, and are carried out autonomously with China as the main body. Moreover, because these areas are important locations in terms of security and economy, this work has brought great economic effects to the government. In this way, the National Government's business of economic reorganization in Central China is being practiced step by step, and Japan's long-term policy transformation will soon be seen. Therefore, we hope that it will make a great contribution to enhancing the war power of Greater East Asia. (Ding: Translated from the March 14th Reader's Report)</p>
<h3>Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers: Hitler Delivers Speech, Strategic Planning for Eastern Front Completed, Guaranteeing Victory Next Month</h3>
<p>Berlin, March 21st, Huitong News Agency: Today, Berlin held a memorial day for fallen soldiers. German leader Hitler delivered the following speech: "We are holding a memorial ceremony for fallen soldiers in this venue, and it has been the fourth time. This memorial ceremony was extended to today before it was held, because for months, I have been busy with official affairs and have hardly had any time. Today, I was finally able to get away and come here. We should thank the soldiers who sacrificed themselves on the Eastern Front, because we have overcome the difficulties and are on the right track. Our front line is now as solid as a rock, and all the decisive strategies have been fully planned. Once next month arrives, we will enter the final stage of victory." The leader continued, "Since the outbreak of the war, the number of Germans who have died has reached 542,000. This sacrifice will never be in vain and will be forever engraved in the hearts of the German people." Regarding the Allied air raids on Germany, the German leader said, "This move will indeed make more areas of Germany become war zones, but he guarantees that the result of these bombings will increase the German people's fighting will and their determination to hate the Allied countries. All neutral countries today are supported by the sacrifices of the German army. Today, the Axis countries and their allies in Europe and East Asia are fighting for their survival, but to achieve this goal, it is impossible to eliminate communism without success. It must be eradicated before we can enjoy lasting peace." The German leader also said, "Regarding the issue of rebuilding a new order after the war, it will be discussed at length by prominent figures from all countries."</p>
<p>Meeting situation</p>
<p>According to the war heroes memorial day held today, it is purely a practical matter. Countless generals of the army, navy, and air force were not given a seat. All special seats are for senior generals, cabinet members, and leaders of various political parties. There are only two long rows of special seats. The German leader sits in the first row, General Goering sits on his right, Premier Keitel and naval admirals also sit next to him, and Dr. Goebbels and Dr. Lié sit on his left. Officers and wounded soldiers are seated under the artillery, and the situation is extremely solemn. When the German leader arrived, these people shouted to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Berlin, March 21st, German News Agency: The German leader personally participated in the memorial ceremony for fallen soldiers held in the Hall of Heroes here today. A special large iron cross was hung on the wall outside the hall. Senior officials from various government departments attended, and the atmosphere was magnificent. Three hundred wounded soldiers participated. When the leader arrived at the meeting, he was accompanied by General Goering, General Keitel, Admiral Baunich, and other important military and political officials. Before taking his seat, the audience saluted with the National Socialist Party salute. After delivering his speech, the leader went to the Memorial Tower of Heroes with his colleagues to pay tribute to the German heroes who had sacrificed themselves. The new and old military flags of the German army, navy, and air force were hung high inside and outside the venue. When the leader left the meeting, the guard of honor paid their respects to him. He then went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay a wreath. After a few minutes of silence, the leader went to the wounded soldiers who were present and had a cordial conversation with them to show his welcome. When the leader got into the car, the crowd cheered.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Talk After Returning to Beijing: Visited and Met with Representatives of Various Countries in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st, Central News Agency: Foreign Minister Chu, after returning to Beijing from Shanghai, issued the following statement: "This time, I went to Shanghai. In addition to attending the tea party hosted by Ambassador Shigemitsu to entertain the diplomatic community, I also took this opportunity to meet with diplomatic representatives of various countries, which was very pleasant. Since the recognition of the National Government by Germany and Italy last year, European countries have successively taken the same steps to establish normal diplomatic relations with the National Government and send representatives to reside in our country. The friendly situation is gradually increasing. Since our country joined the war, we have not only devoted ourselves to the common war against Britain and the United States with our friendly country Japan, but also the European Axis countries are pursuing the consolidation of friendly relations with the same goal. The successive declarations of the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by various countries prove that the enthusiasm of our country in participating in the war is deeply understood by various countries. In order to actively promote the realization of this issue as soon as possible, I held separate meetings with representatives of various countries. I met with representatives of Italy, Spain, Denmark, and other countries successively. After the meetings, the discussions were extremely harmonious. Although I could not make concrete consultations on the above issues due to the short time, I learned that all friendly countries have a positive willingness to assist in this issue and achieve its realization as soon as possible. This enthusiastic expression of sincerity can be seen in the overall consultation, where satisfactory discussions were achieved within the scope of various principles. In short, I firmly believe that with the full assistance of our friendly country Japan, significant progress will be made in the near future regarding the two matters of receiving concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. Also, I was able to meet with the German Consul General in Shanghai this time and visit the organization of his intelligence work. I am deeply impressed by the scale of its organization, its neat operation, and its thorough flexibility."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Governor Announces Remittance Method</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st, Central News Agency: Yesterday, the Hong Kong Governor announced a method to centralize foreign exchange between Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, North China, and Manchuria, and to simplify all methods for remittances between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Hainan Island. The Ministry of Finance also announced that, in the future, remittances between Hong Kong and Guangzhou and between Hong Kong and Hainan Island can be made freely with the approval of the authorities. However, only Japanese merchant banks will handle the remittances temporarily. Remittances under 500 Japanese yen do not require an application for permission. In addition, a method for settling trade balances between Hong Kong, Zhaonan (Singapore), and the Philippines was also stipulated. Accounts between Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, North China, and Manchuria are calculated in special yen by the Tokyo side. Accounts between Hong Kong and Japan and Central China are generally calculated in military scrip, in accordance with usual rules. These trade accounts must be handled and cleared by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce. However, in special circumstances, non-members of the Chamber of Commerce may also apply to the Hong Kong Governor for approval. For example, for the import of goods, if special permission has been obtained, it should be settled in accordance with the yen exchange rate of the letter of credit issued by the place of import.</p>

<h3>Authoritative Discourse by Japanese Ethnological Research Circles: The War Aims of Japan and the United States Differ</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) Dr. Takada Yasuma, Director of the Japanese Ethnological Research Institute and an authority in the field of ethnology, recently authored an article entitled "The War Aims of Japan and the United States Differ," published in the "Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun." He pointed out that the United States' war aim is merely Roosevelt's attempt to conquer the world. His argument is quite insightful, and the gist is as follows: In today's war, the United States is indeed our most important opponent. But what exactly is the war aim of the United States? Even if one asks the American people, they will be at a loss for an answer. The United States already possesses the majority of the world's wealth and resources, and its national income is among the highest in the world. They have no need to seek anything further. Moreover, no country in the world would even consider invading the United States across vast oceans if it only had its understanding and assistance. Therefore, the United States has no reason to participate in the war, nor need it worry about foreign invasion. It is truly perplexing that the United States has ultimately been drawn into the vortex of war. Japan has no intention of harming the United States and sincerely hopes to gain its understanding. However, the United States has strongly provoked Japan and rashly initiated hostilities, which is truly a strange occurrence in the world. The American people are unaware of the reasons for the war between Japan and the United States and deeply feel that there should be reflection on this matter. If we observe calmly, we can discover that the reason for the United States engaging in war lies solely in Roosevelt's ambition to conquer the world. This is also the driving force behind the United States' waging war. Only if one is compelled to fight for national self-defense can it be called a just war and lead troops with dignity. However, today's war by the United States is for personal ambition and can be said to be without just cause. The intellectual class of the United States still does not understand the purpose of the American war. Some say they are fighting to uphold democracy. Roosevelt and Churchill also say that this war is not only a conflict between totalitarianism and democracy, but also a war between the two ideologies. As for whether what they say is true, there is obvious contradiction in the facts. If they want to outwardly express support for democracy, they should also uphold and implement democracy internally. But if one looks at the United States, is there not still a class system with barbaric customs? And are more than ten million Black people not still being treated inhumanely? Not only that, but its immigration laws actually violate democracy. Democracy is a system for realizing the freedom and equality of individuals, but the current immigration laws of the United States do not mention equality or freedom at all. Furthermore, has the United States also realized democracy in its economic organization? If we look at the United States since the global economic crisis, there have always been ten million unemployed people in the country. Although the US government has made various efforts to reduce the number of unemployed, it has had no effect. Until the outbreak of the war, the number of unemployed remained the same as before, and the major financial magnates in the country believe that the existence of unemployed people is a natural state of affairs. They still do not change their attitude of striving for profit. May I ask if the goal of democracy should be like this? What we should still not ignore is Roosevelt's dictatorial politics. After the outbreak of the war, he monopolized power in all aspects of politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economy, almost implementing complete dictatorship. In order to realize his personal ambitions, he did not hesitate to draw all Americans into the war. Therefore, the American people themselves have no sense of war, but are driven by Roosevelt's ambition. This dictatorial politics is contrary to democracy. Furthermore, according to recent reports, the United States also said that they are fighting for self-preservation. This is even more absurd, because dreaming of dominating the world contradicts self-preservation and self-defense. Then what exactly is the United States fighting for? The motivation for American citizens to participate in the war is not entirely to obey Roosevelt's will; they only hope to develop as a group outwards as a country. They still deeply hope for the expansion of the country itself. In this sense, the idea of American imperialism can be said to be deeply rooted. Therefore, their blind obedience to Roosevelt is only to seek personal enjoyment, and for personal enjoyment, they attempt to seize world resources, ultimately threatening the survival and independence of the nation. How can this be called the way of freedom and equality?</p>

<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Mobilize Fresh Troops for Reinforcement: Fierce Battles in the Upper Reaches of the Donets; Key City of Zevsk Captured by Germany; Soviet Offensive in the Orel Region Fails</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch) According to official Berlin news last night, General von Manstein's German forces launched a strong counteroffensive from Kursk and advanced towards the Donets River, capturing Zevsk (90 kilometers northwest of Kursk) and Tomarovka (approximately 15 kilometers west of Belgorod). German forces operating southeast of Kharkov have advanced to the upper reaches of the Donets River on a broad front in recent days and have crossed the river in several places. Over the past few days, Soviet forces have fiercely attacked Chuguyev, a key point approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, in an attempt to drive out the German forces. However, the city and railway station are still firmly held by German forces. The Soviet offensive at this location resulted in the annihilation of the 62nd Infantry Division, and its commander was captured. Reuters Moscow admitted that the Soviet forces in this sector of the front were gradually being threatened. It is said that the entire battle along the upper reaches of the Donets River has now reached a critical stage. Both sides are engaged in heavy fighting, but the vast area is desolate, making it difficult to transport supplies to the rear of the Soviet lines. Yesterday, German mechanized reinforcements and aircraft launched a fierce attack on the narrow area southeast of Kharkov. Soviet reserves have also been moved closer to the main battle area, and the fighting is intensifying. The Soviet side is waiting for the ice on the Donets River to melt, hoping to reduce the German pressure. The German forces are currently concentrated in certain districts, and the German forces in one of these districts forced the Soviet forces to retreat to new lines in the past 24 hours. A major battle for a certain key city is now underway. The German forces are concentrating all their efforts at this point in an attempt to break through the Soviet defenses. German forces in another district launched an offensive with two large columns of tanks yesterday, it is said. According to another British report, General von Manstein is now deploying some of Germany's most elite soldiers in an attempt to cross the middle reaches of the Donets River. The outcome of the battle there is expected to be decided within 48 hours, it is said. Furthermore, news from Berlin last night stated that after the German forces captured Belgorod, they continued their offensive around the city on Friday, repelling strong Soviet resistance and attacking the small town of Tomarovka west of Belgorod. Before the fall of the city, Soviet forces launched several counterattacks, which were all repelled, resulting in the loss of 65 tanks. German forces to the north continued their offensive in the Kursk area and captured Setsk after fierce street fighting. At the same time, the Red Army continued to launch large-scale attacks in the Orel region, south of Vyazma, and at Staraya Russa south of Lake Ilmen, repeatedly attacking the strong German defenses despite suffering heavy losses, but achieving nothing. The German High Command announced yesterday that the Soviet losses in the battles around Kharkov since February 13 amounted to over 54,000 dead, 20,000 captured, and the Red Army also lost 1,410 tanks, 3,372 artillery pieces, and 3,045 various heavy infantry weapons.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 21st (Havas dispatch) The focus of today's Eastern Front is still in the south, with German forces intensifying pressure along the Kursk-Voroshilovgrad line. The Red Army hopes that the weather will warm up, bringing the fighting to a standstill. Yesterday, German armored forces continued to launch offensives, reaching the upper reaches of the Donets River, and crossing the river in several locations to the south. The Soviet side also acknowledged that the Red Army had lost an important position in the Donets River basin. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Chuguyev area. German forces are advancing towards the city of Kupiansk. To the north, after German forces captured the city of Belgorod, they also cleared the Soviet-held salient in the Lebedin area and captured the Tomarovka station on the Belgorod-Krolevets railway. According to a Moscow Radio broadcast, the battle on the Donets River has reached its peak, with both sides mobilizing large numbers of fresh troops for reinforcement. The number of German infantry and armored vehicle personnel is far greater than that of the Red Army, and they are constantly advancing, encountering resolute resistance from the Red Army. Semi-official Soviet sources acknowledged that German forces also have air superiority over the front lines, but the Soviet side also has reason to be optimistic, as the ground ice and snow have begun to melt, turning the ground into a sea of mud, and after the rivers thaw, the ice floes are drifting with the current, and natural obstacles have reappeared. However, the German forces have already crossed the Donets River, preventing the Red Army from digging trenches on the riverbank, and the railway between the Don and Donets rivers was destroyed by the German forces before their retreat, making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to concentrate its forces. In the Zevsk-Kursk area, the German forces are continuing to exert pressure, forcing the Red Army to abandon Zevsk, thus removing the threat posed by the Red Army to the cities of Bryansk and Orel.</p>
<h3>Continuous Heavy Rains; Situation Quiet on the Tunisian Front; German Forces Capture Important Hill in the North; Supply Line of the British First Army's Left Wing Cut Off</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas dispatch) Due to continuous heavy rains on the Tunisian front, the area has become a sea of water, so military operations on the front have stalled, and even air force activity is impossible. German war reports state that the entire Tunisian front is quiet, and that German aircraft bombing the port of Tripoli were very successful. According to Allied Command Headquarters, Tunisia is extremely quiet today, and the British Eighth Army is currently consolidating its positions.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch) According to news from Berlin last night, German forces in northern Tunisia captured Hill 474 on Friday, despite adverse weather conditions, cutting off the main force of General Anderson's British First Army from its only supply port on the Mediterranean coast in Tunisia, Tebaga. The supply route from Madoubi (approximately 75 kilometers southwest of Bizerte) to Tebaga is now controlled by German forces, and Black Point (approximately 75 kilometers northeast of Tebaga), including Hill 474, is now in German hands. German forces continued to advance westward after overcoming strong British resistance on Friday, capturing several important positions of the British First Army despite the bad weather. With the British vehicle supply route between Tebaga and Madou now controlled by German forces, the left wing of the British First Army cannot obtain direct supplies from this only port held by British forces in Tunisia. This is the final victory of the Axis offensive aimed at driving the British forces out of Bizerte and Tunis. In this attack, the Axis forces have captured Cape Serrat, Black Point, Settnan, and Tamura. According to a United States reporter dispatch from General Eisenhower's headquarters last night, American forces in the Gafsa region of central Tunisia are encountering strong resistance from Axis forces in the El Guettar Mountains. Axis artillery and infantry are firmly entrenched in pre-built positions, and a fierce battle is expected soon. Heavy rain has made the battlefield muddy, with depths ranging from three inches to two feet, making it almost impossible for tanks to move. As for the situation in southern Tunisia, the British forces under General Montgomery attempted to break through the Axis defenses in the Mareth Line area on Wednesday but failed, and the situation has been quiet since Friday. No changes in positions were reported by either side last night.</p>
<h3>German Submarines in the Atlantic Attack British Convoy; Relentless Pursuit for Five Days and Nights; Seventeen Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A spokesman for German Naval High Command Admiral Dönitz stated yesterday that German submarines had sunk a large number of ships in a convoy in the Atlantic, based on prior experience. After the convoy departed from England, it was detected by German submarines, which then alerted other submarines to prepare for an attack. On the night of March 16, German submarines broke through the outer defenses of the enemy fleet and attacked its ships, sinking twelve of them totaling 70,000 tons and severely damaging four others. The next day, the four damaged ships also sank. The remaining ships, seeing the situation was unfavorable, sped up in an attempt to escape, but the German submarines continued to pursue them relentlessly for five days and nights until they ran out of torpedoes. In this operation, German submarines also sank a British destroyer, it is said.</p>

<h3>Japan-U.S. Air War Roundtable (3): From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods</h3>
<p>The tragedy born from a lack of aviation knowledge requires a preparedness and determination to fear nothing.</p>
<p>Reporter: It doesn't matter when they come, tragedies won't happen, there must be sufficient preparation and strong determination. If this continues, with such tense emotions...</p>
<p>Bennet: That means being fearless!</p>
<p>Okada: Thinking about the other extreme is also dangerous. At the same time, negligence is also dangerous. It is the duty of those in charge to make people clearly understand the correct standards and objective requirements. For example, after the air raid on April 18th last time, various reactionary rumors spread, and all sorts of opinions were heard. If you analyze this situation, you can see that the lack of aviation knowledge led to speaking without limits. This is the only reason for the reactionary rumors. For example, the concept of aircraft speed is almost imagined as something out of mythology. Furthermore, the aircraft's range is exaggerated, simply lacking common sense. As a result, all sorts of imaginations become popular, leading to self-confusion and panic. Although our country has air defense propaganda, we should instill more aviation knowledge and aircraft knowledge into the public, otherwise, they will not understand the true air defense belief. To take an example before our eyes, during the last air raid, some people said that the planes flew divinely, but this was not divine, but rather flying at around 500 kilometers per hour. This is not economic speed, it is flying at combat speed. It's like looking at distant mountains from a train. They don't even have this kind of common sense, so they say "divine" and "leisurely." If they understood a little more scientific knowledge, after seeing it with their own eyes, and had some common sense about the speed of the aircraft, they wouldn't talk nonsense. Just saying, "be determined, be decisive, be calm" doesn't work. Therefore, there will no longer be extreme fear. This is really like deceiving children. It is also an unscientific idea. I believe the prerequisite is to infuse more aviation common sense.</p>
<p>Oonishi: For example, if an airplane is flying towards you, it would be good to know where it usually drops bombs to fall near you; but when the airplane drops bombs, they think it will fall near them. This is because they lack common sense about airplanes dropping bombs. Airplanes fly over your head, but the bombs dropped will never fall on your head. Without this common sense, no matter where the bombs are dropped, they always feel like they will fall on them.</p>
<p>Okada: That's how it feels when you watch. When it's flying toward your head, you don't think that way. This type of angle, this type of common sense, is really lacking.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Everyone says it's right above them, but there's only one point directly above.</p>
<p>Matsuura: The human eye has illusions.</p>
<p>Abe: This kind of knowledge must be instilled in the public.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Generally speaking, they mostly know that if a bomb lands near them, it will land near them. Bombs dropped while flying sideways will not land near them. Bombs dropped while flying directly towards them at a certain angle may land in their location. Where I live, the most worrying thing is the lack of shelters. Where can you go to be safe? There isn't such a place. Where I live, is it safe to go into the forest? That's not necessarily safe. If there's a reliable shelter to hide from air raids, everyone would be calm and not panicked, but we don't have this kind of air raid shelter. Some people dig air raid shelters in their own homes, but they don't reach a truly safe level. Safe air raid shelters are almost non-existent in private residences. Whenever there is a drill, the problem is always where to evacuate. Because there is no absolutely safe place, the evacuation location is also not necessarily safe, and gathering many people in the shelter means that bombs may fall there. Therefore, safe and solid air raid shelters are urgently needed, and at the same time, these safe air raid shelters should not be too far from the people, so panic and confusion will never occur. However, this is probably the case everywhere in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Okada: The way to turn danger into safety is to avoid concentrating in one place as much as possible.</p>
<p>Oonishi: Logically speaking, it is a dangerous thing to gather children and the elderly together under a banner, and to drag the sick and injured to this place.</p>
<p>Abe: If you stand in an open field in a park, bomb fragments will not hit you if the bomb lands far away. If you lie in a depression, it is also not dangerous if the bomb lands at a considerable distance. That is to say, lying on the ground and not gathering in one place, but dispersing separately, can achieve a near-absolute level of safety.</p>
<p>Oonishi: I think my house will not be hit by a bomb.</p>
<p>Abe: It is safer to live in a house with a place separated by a mat. It's very dangerous for everyone to be together.</p>
<p>How to Evade Air Raids? A Japanese-Style Guidance Method is Needed.</p>
<p>Reporter: It seems that the best way to evacuate is to disperse separately and escape to a suitable place.</p>
<p>Abe: So-called evacuation is preparing to deal with the fire caused by incendiary bombs, the strongly harmful explosions of poison gas bombs, etc., before the bombs are dropped. This is the only spirit of wartime evacuation.</p>
<p>Okada: Because an airplane flies over your head for at most ten minutes, lying down in a nearby ditch, or leaning against a cement wall, etc., but the best way, I think, is to lie down in a nearby place. During the air raid on April 18th last time, those who lay down were spared, and of course, we must attribute this to the propaganda of methods for evading air raids. This kind of lying-down training is very necessary. For example, women clearly knew that lying down was right, but because they were not trained, they were killed by bomb fragments. There were also people who were spared when a bomb exploded seven meters in front of them, and there were people who saved their lives by crawling under a ping-pong table. There was an example of a child hiding behind the back of a water tank and turning danger into safety. Conversely, there were people who were killed by fragments of anti-aircraft fire while standing. During recent training, there has been a great deal of debate about evasion. They say that there is no need to create an evasion area, that evasion is incompatible with the Japanese nature, that it is a cowardly act, that Japanese people want to risk going out to put out fires, to rescue people in a hail of bullets. Evasion is like not being a firefighter, and going to an air raid shelter. This kind of statement is wrong, because in times of war, even during an assault, there must be temporary cover and concealment before moving forward, and because cover and advance is the basic principle of an assault, there are firefighters who still refuse to leave the evasion area even when the enemy plane has flown far away. There's really no way to deal with this. Staying in the evasion area for two hours means that nothing else can be done. These problems are very difficult to correct just right. When an emergency alarm is issued, enemy planes should arrive in about fifteen minutes, but sometimes the enemy planes do not arrive for more than an hour after the emergency alarm. Therefore, a lookout is sent, and only when the lookout sees the enemy planes flying over the city and issues an air raid alarm do they go to the evasion area, and then after bombs fall everywhere, they leave the evasion area to put out fires. There are times when things don't go well, and some people even say, "I misjudged last time, next time I will look carefully no matter what."</p>
<p>Bennet: Regarding evasion, if it is not particularly emphasized, when simply emphasized in a normal way, it will not produce effective results, and evasion is a momentary thing of about one minute, so this point is very difficult for the Japanese to achieve.</p>
<p>Oonishi: They all think, "How regrettable it would be if others saw it and I didn't see it." They also hold a contemptuous view of cowardice.</p>
<p>Okada: Therefore, there must be a guidance method that suits the Japanese people. Furthermore, things like anti-aircraft fire fragments are also quite dangerous, so when anti-aircraft guns are firing, they should also evade slightly.</p>
<p>Fujita: Anti-aircraft fire fragments are also quite dangerous?</p>
<p>Oonishi: It's dangerous if you don't wear a steel helmet.</p>
<p>Okada: Therefore, people who want to move freely in the anti-aircraft artillery position must evade. I once went to Songbing Fourth National Elementary School to observe evasion training. Because it is a densely populated area, the principal enthusiastically led all the faculty and students in training, and the results were very good. Elementary school students all carry cushions. They fasten this cushion to their side with buttons, and when the air raid alarm sounds, they put it on their head. Then they crawl under the table. If they are on the playground, they disperse, and then use their hands to block their ears and eyes. This is the formal method.</p>
<p>Fujita: Block with hands?</p>
<p>Okada: Of course, block with hands. Because ruptured eardrums or injured eyes would be terrible, so you have to do it this way. This doesn't require a lot of work. After blocking, immediately take it down to put out fires.</p>
<p>Fujita: Is it done this way after the order is given?</p>
<p>Okada: When the lookout tower shouts "Enemy planes flying over the city," do it this way. This is because the children of the national elementary school cannot go home when the air raid alarm is issued, and if they are outside for two or three hours to evade the alarm, the parents are also very worried, so this training is a completely appropriate method. Or, part of them are advised to go home. If you don't do it this way, sometimes it doesn't make sense. Especially the Japanese people are particularly protective of children. If children are injured, it will still shake people's hearts very much.</p>
<p>Fujita: Children's affairs are the most difficult to handle.</p>
<p>Okada: It's really difficult to handle. Adults being injured does not affect people's hearts like children, so you must think of a proper evasion method for children.</p>

<p>The contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession have prepared the 30th ration of household food. Starting yesterday, it is distributed with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates. The total is two and a half "sheng" of white rice (including domestic Du rice, Wuhu Xian rice, and foreign rice), priced at 7.5 yuan, which is slightly more expensive than the previous period by 5 "jiao" per "sheng." The total is one catty and four taels of second-grade flour, and four taels of third-grade flour, priced at 3.3 yuan. Although the quantity is reduced by four taels compared to the previous period, the price is the same. The validity period of the above 30th rice flour certificate is until March 30th. Overdue certificates will be voided and cannot be reissued. As for the contracted rice shops, they were notified yesterday by the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Public Works Department that the 30th period rice price is 368.5 yuan per bag of 101.5 kg, and the flour is still 92 yuan per bag of 49 pounds. However, the rice price when each rice shop received the sales order this time was 308.6 yuan per bag, so according to the new price, it should supplement 59.9 yuan per bag. The payment is limited to the next period to receive the sales order to supplement the payment.</p>
<h3>Rice Distribution to be Further Improved</h3>
<p>Since the major food items in the Shanghai area are subject to strict control, and the authorities have gradually increased the allocation of household food, the food situation in this city has stabilized, and the psychology of food panic has weakened. As for the source of household food in this city, according to the Great Universal News Agency reporter, it can be optimistic. At present, the transportation between Shanghai and the neighboring rice-producing areas has gradually become convenient, and the authorities have also planned proper methods for the distribution of public rice. It can also be guaranteed that any private embezzlement and corruption of rice shops will be investigated and punished.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes in this City Implemented Rationing: All Procedures Being Expedited</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association handled the distribution of tobacco in this city. It previously notified all cigarette shops, large and small, to register with the association for review. It is now known that the review has been completed. There are more than 300 approved general sales merchants, and more than 5,400 small retailers. As for retail prices, they cannot be announced because the prices of some cigarettes are still under discussion. The association is currently expediting all procedures. Once the procedures are completed, an official announcement will be published. Also, it is reported that the Huazhong Cigarette Distribution Association, in order to unify and concentrate the distribution of cigarettes, has completed the registration review of cigarette retailers throughout the city. There are more than 300 approved general wholesalers, and more than 5,400 small retailers. The general wholesalers are divided into A and B levels. They have respectively filled out contracts and paid the deposit to the designated tobacco industry bank within the specified time. The general wholesalers have convened a members' congress to discuss future business policies, and a concrete plan has been decided. Starting yesterday, the city's cigarette prices have begun to fall. The existing cigarette shops are striving to sell their inventory, fearing that once the rationed goods are issued, they must be sold at the limited price, and this inventory will inevitably lose money. Furthermore, foreign households have also emerged, so cigarette prices in recent days are expected to decline further.</p>
<h3>City Residence Permits: Use Carefully</h3>
<p>Regarding the citizen residence permits, the Municipal Police Department has issued more than 1.4 million. There are still many who have not received them. Citizens who have already obtained the residence permit should use it carefully and avoid losing it. In the event of loss, in addition to immediately reporting to the nearest police station or the police station in charge, they must also declare the lost residence permit number in the newspaper as void and request a replacement. The police station in charge will conduct an investigation and reissue if it deems the loss to be true.</p>
<h3>Foreign Schools of the Public Works Department Merged and Resumed Classes: Officially Start School on April 1st, All Courses Not Changed</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ueno, the Education Superintendent of the Public Works Department, told reporters that the four foreign schools of the Bureau will be merged into two schools starting on April 1st, one exclusively for boys and the other exclusively for girls. The former is located at No. 544 Seymour Road, and the latter is located at No. 425 Haig Road. According to Yun, the merger of the Bureau's schools is to facilitate educational efficiency. It is said that after the merger, the two schools have added teachers, and the number of teachers is about 100. Among these 100 people, all are graduates of universities in various countries. Ueno continued that the curriculum of the two schools will not be changed, and the students will continue to study the subjects they had previously learned, and they will enter university to study. At the same time, it is also known that after the foreign schools of the Public Works Department were closed on March 2nd, they will be merged into two schools and resume classes on April 1st. Up to now, the new and old students have been very enthusiastic about registering. Ueno also said that the closure of the Public Works Department schools was entirely temporary, and he hoped that the parents of the students would not mind, and that the high standard of the Public Works Department schools would be maintained.</p>

<h3>Post Office Employees Mailing Parcels Should Follow Regulations</h3>
<p>In order to improve the procedures for employees in the bureau to mail packages and to strictly prohibit employees in the bureau from mailing packages in order to make undue profits, the Postal Administration issued a notice from the director, Mr. Zha Peilin, saying: "It has been found that employees in the bureau who mail packages should follow the prescribed procedures, and are not allowed to enter the package mailing counter without permission, and to stand next to the inspector's desk, requesting special accommodation for the packages they mail, which hinders the inspector's work. The Bureau's Decree No. 5419 has been notified in the case. Now, in order to facilitate the employees of the Bureau, if there are genuine personal packages to be mailed in the future, they can inquire with the supervisor of the package mailing group about the various procedures for inspection and mailing, and follow the time and method indicated by the supervisor of the group, so as to avoid waiting for a long time and benefit work. Furthermore, post office employees are not allowed to use mailing packages to seek profits. If there is a deliberate violation, once found, they will be severely punished."</p>

<h3>A Complete View of French Vietnam (5)</h3>
<p>— A Vietnamese Person</p>
<p>(4) The Pearl of the French Colonies</p>
<p>Vietnam is "the Pearl of the French Colonies," a boast often made by France. If one examines all of France's colonies, it has long lost its original territories in the Americas. In Africa, it can be described as the "French Colonial World," but ultimately consists mostly of barren land. The most resource-rich of all is Vietnam!</p>
<p>Regarding Vietnam's industries, the most important is its abundant agriculture, with rice production holding the top position. In recent years, the mining industry has also seen some development. Additionally, the forestry and fishing industries cannot be overlooked. From an economic perspective, the distribution of industrial areas is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Saigon Area: Refers to Cochinchina, Cambodia, Southern Laos, and the area south of Faifo in Annam. Except for fishing along the coast and in the southern swampy areas, the entire region is an agricultural zone, one of the world's largest rice-producing areas.</p>
<p>(2) Haiphong Area: Refers to the Tonkin Protectorate and the northern part of Annam. The main industries are agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>(3) Central Annam Area: From Thuan An to Cape Faifo, this is primarily an agricultural zone. Cinnamon, sugar, tea, maize, etc., are exported from Tourane, but rice production is relatively low.</p>
<p>The fact that agricultural products account for 70% of Vietnam's exports indicates the significant role of agriculture in Vietnam's industry. The majority of agricultural products, such as rice, tobacco, cotton, and mulberry, are produced by locals using traditional methods, which are essentially Chinese production methods. In addition, there are modern enterprises managed by Europeans, such as rubber, coffee, and tea plantations. Other local products include maize, beans, soybeans, sweet potatoes, millet, sesame, peanuts, vegetables, fresh fruits, pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, opium poppy, medicinal pastes, betel nuts, sugarcane, coconuts, gutta-percha, kapok, hemp, ramie, lacquer, indigo, turmeric, etc. Modern agricultural enterprises also cultivate maize, sugarcane, castor beans, tung oil, and hemp in Tonkin; rice, pepper, and oil palm in Cochinchina; rice in Cambodia; and quinine in Laos.</p>
<p>Forests cover approximately 57% of Vietnam's total area, especially in the upper Mekong River region, abundant in ironwood and general timber, but much of it remains undeveloped. The situation is as follows (units in ten million kilometers):</p>
<p>Richly stocked forests 600</p>
<p>Moderately stocked forests 14,000</p>
<p>Richly stocked grasslands 12,300</p>
<p>Moderately stocked grasslands 140</p>
<p>Total 42,440</p>
<p>Among these, ironwood (used for shipbuilding and construction) is particularly abundant in Laos, along the upper Mekong River. The annual output is 20,000 to 100,000 cubic meters. It is transported down the river to Saigon and then exported to India, Hong Kong, France, Britain, Singapore, and other places. In addition, soft wood for match production is also produced in large quantities. Bamboo is an important construction material and furniture material for the locals. Rattan is particularly abundant in Annam and Tonkin, and is exported to Hong Kong and southern Chinese provinces, providing a significant source of local revenue. Wood and charcoal are managed by overseas Chinese and locals, and exported from Saigon and other places to Thailand, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Vietnam is bordered by the sea on three sides, and has large rivers and lakes inland, so aquatic products are very abundant, providing a major sideline for rural areas. It can be divided into marine and freshwater categories. (1) Marine fisheries, the most important areas are (A) the Tonkin coast, centered around Ha Long Bay, where Chinese fishermen have an advantage, coming from the Beihai and Hainan Island areas. Their catches are mostly sold in the Haiphong market. (B) The Annam coast, mainly in the northern part, has about 30,000 fishermen and aquatic product processors. The number of female workers is also about 30,000, and there are about 3,000 fishing boats. (C) The Cochinchina coast, centered on the east coast and the Gulf of Siam, where the fishermen are mostly overseas Chinese and locals. (D) The Cambodian coast, where about 3,000 Annam fishermen and overseas Chinese invest in aquatic product processing, with many small factories employing 1,000 to 4,000 francs. (2) Freshwater fisheries, due to the abundance of rivers and lakes, are very developed despite primitive fishing methods. The most prosperous area is Cambodia, with the Tonle Sap Lake, which covers 3,000 square kilometers at its lowest water level, serving as a natural fish farm.</p>
<p>Exports of marine and freshwater products have been increasing year by year, mainly to Singapore (71%), Hong Kong (12%), and China, Thailand, and other places.</p>
<p>Agriculture accounts for 70% of Vietnam's exports in the form of food, which is one of the most significant results of French rule. From the beginning, their policy towards Vietnam was primarily aimed at creating a country supplying agricultural raw materials to satisfy the development of their own industry. However, even in agriculture, they have absolutely not promoted modernization, striving to maintain primitive agricultural production methods. As a result, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries remain in the primitive economic stage, and farmers live in poverty.</p>
<p>Next, Vietnam's important resources are minerals, especially known for the high quality and abundant reserves of anthracite coal. Currently, the larger-scale production includes coal, tin, tungsten, gold, and zinc. In addition, there are also iron, antimony, phosphate, rock salt, talc, etc., being developed.</p>
<p>Fuel minerals, i.e., various coal mines, occupy a relatively important position in Vietnam's industry, centered around Tonkin, which mainly supplies anthracite and lignite. The anthracite, also known as Hong Gai coal, is found in nine anthracite mines near Dong Trieu along the coast of Ha Long Bay, with two each of bituminous and lignite mines. The annual output is around 2 million tons. In 1939, exports amounted to 1.57 million tons, worth 9.9 million Vietnamese piasters, mostly sold to Japan, China, and the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.</p>
<p>The main metallic minerals are zinc and tin. Tin mines are famous in Tonkin and Laos. The former is developed by the Tonkin Tin Company and Wolfram Company, while the latter is developed by the Vietnamese Mining Exploration Company. A tin smelting company is located in Haiphong, and 99% of the product is exported to Singapore, with the remainder sold to France and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In addition, tungsten production is 327 tons (1938), gold production is 312 kg (1937), iron production is 72,000 tons (1938), antimony production is 47 tons (1936), and phosphate production is 43,000 tons (1938). As for lead, silver, silica sand, talc, asbestos, gems, etc., there are no official statistics.</p>
<p>However, due to France's protectionist policies, although many French people are involved in management, the actual production volume and quality have not reached the proper level. Abundant resources are still abandoned in the wild. This can only be attributed to the lack of active interest among French entrepreneurs in developing Vietnam, and the difficult situation of France itself is also a very important reason. (End)</p>

<h3>First Division of the Western League: The Yi Army Leads, Lianyi Temporarily Ranked Second, and Donghua is Third</h3>
<p>The First Division of the Western League football league has entered its second round. Yesterday, four matches were postponed due to wet playing fields. Jia Youliang, a player from the Donghua team, was injured in his right eye due to excessive tension during the Tongren Fuyuan Cup charity match and left the field immediately to receive medical treatment. It is said that the injury is minor and there is no cause for concern. In the recent situation in the First Division, the Yihai Army still holds the top spot, with six wins, two draws, and one loss. The only team that can compete with the Yi Army is Lianyi. Donghua is ranked third, although the points difference is only one point, the hope of winning the championship is slim. Lianyi has one more match, so the points ratio is actually equal to the Yi Army. If the points are equal at the end, there is hope for a final to determine the championship. If Lianyi can win every game, their future prospects are limitless. The First Division championship may return to the Chinese. However, most of the Yihai Army's strong players have left, and Lianyi still has the hidden danger of Donghua. If they unfortunately lose to Donghua, all their previous efforts will be in vain, creating an absolute advantage for the Yihai Army, and the future of the Chinese will be bleak. The fourth-place Jewish Portuguese Chamber of Commerce is temporarily ranked fifth. St. Francis has not been very successful in the league, ranking sixth. Sokol has lost repeatedly and is at the bottom. The Jiaozhou Park has been scheduled to stop using the playing field starting on April 1st, and the authorities are very distressed. In addition to trying to resolve the issue, they are also looking for another venue to ensure a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper was released at 7:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Economic News</h3>
<p>After the abolition of the permit system for the movement of important materials in the Shanghai area, the use, manufacturing, and sale of all materials are now under the autonomous control and regulation of the Sino-Japanese trade associations and existing organizations established in the spring. To ensure the sound operation of the regulatory mechanisms of these associations, the relevant authorities are currently studying specific measures, and a proper solution is expected to be finalized by next week at the latest. (March 21, Continental News)</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>New Policy and the Responsibilities of Economists</h3>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association has been born. China's autonomous economic control can gradually progress from now on, and its control system is expected to achieve further success. However, we are also reminded that the responsibilities of Chinese economists are becoming increasingly important. This time, the ability to establish a wartime economy and resolve wartime livelihood issues through autonomous regulation by private economists demonstrates the vision and strength of Chinese economists, and the wise and decisive decision of the Chinese and Japanese authorities is commendable.</p>
<p>Chinese economists must also understand the intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, adapt to the needs of military and civilian life, and strive for complete success. This is the responsibility of Chinese economists, and the operation of the Control Association should also be approached from this perspective. These matters are well-known to informed individuals in China, especially economists with broad perspectives. However, among some people in the financial sector, there are still those who do not fully understand and believe that it is premature, or hold misunderstandings. Some consider the new policy to be a move towards liberal economics, some believe it is a precursor to restoring the pre-Greater East Asia War state, and some believe it is a reaction against the control system. Such absurd and unfounded misconceptions are rampant among merchants. Therefore, the current major issue is to dispel these fallacies and misconceptions from the economic sector, so that the public can understand the nature and direction of the new policy, as well as the true intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>The goal of the new policy is to achieve the military needs related to the Chinese economy, while also rationally resolving livelihood issues. It should be noted that adopting autonomous control methods is the most effective and reasonable approach. If this fact can be clearly understood, all misunderstandings about the new policy will naturally dissipate, and the hesitation towards joint ventures and cooperation with the Japanese side can also be resolved. Chinese economists must understand that only by cooperating with the Japanese side can the wartime economic problems and livelihood issues be fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>As the new policy is implemented, the possibility of cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people will also increase. True cooperation and equal conditions can be achieved.</p>
<p>Japanese economists, taking advantage of the opportunity of the new policy's implementation, are prepared to abandon all privileges, which is a symbol of their initial enthusiasm for cooperation. Japanese economists are now making their best efforts to adapt to the new policy. If the Chinese side distorts these facts and is misled by rumors, they will inevitably regret it in the future. At the same time, the Japanese side should also consider the overall situation and strive to achieve cooperation between the people to complete the rear area task of promoting the Greater East Asia War.

<h3>Various Trade Associations Ordered to Register Inventory</h3>
<p>To assist in the handling of material movement matters and to promote the welfare of the trade, the city's trade associations have been ordered to register the inventory of their respective industries, and the deadline is set for the 23rd of this month. All member merchants can obtain the required inventory registration forms from the relevant trade associations between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM, and between 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM daily, and submit them to the associations within the deadline.

<h3>National Chamber of Commerce Control Association Decides on Important Cases Regarding the Movement of Goods Within the City</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association held a joint provisional meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday (20th) to discuss the issue of the movement of goods within the city and the issue of exporting and importing non-controlled goods. With the guidance of Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at the meeting, a satisfactory solution has been reached. The association's work has been extremely tense since its inception. Yesterday (21st), although it was Sunday, the responsible personnel still worked as usual. Chairman Tang also convened a meeting with the Secretary-General, secretaries, and relevant responsible personnel to discuss all work progress issues. It is reported that the association will move into the building at 984 Avenue Haig next week. The full text of the association's telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the resolutions on the movement of goods is recorded below.</p>
<p>Telegram to Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing: This association convened a provisional joint meeting of directors and supervisors today. As the issue of material movement is of great importance, we specially invited Vice Minister Yuan to attend and provide guidance. The relevant proposals and resolutions are listed as follows: (1) How should we handle the fact that all goods in Shanghai can be moved freely according to the government's issued crackdown regulations? (2) Some trade associations have sent letters stating that since the suspension of material movement, goods that are not under control have also been prohibited from moving. They have requested assistance to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. How should we handle this issue? Resolution on both cases: The movement of goods within the Shanghai area, except for those stipulated in the crackdown regulations that must wait for notification after registration is completed before they can be moved, all other goods are allowed to be moved freely. Please notify the relevant parties. (3) How should we handle the issue of moving goods out, except for those stipulated in the crackdown regulations that require permission from this association? Resolution on this case: For goods outside the scope of the crackdown regulations, this association will temporarily not handle applications for import and export until the government issues other measures. (4) How should we determine the quantity of various goods that must be approved by this association for import and export as stipulated in the crackdown regulations? Resolution on this case: (A) Before the new measures are decided by the Material Control Review Committee and issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to this association, we will temporarily handle them according to the original method. (B) Before the organization of this association is fully completed, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will send personnel to handle the matter on behalf of the association using the association's permission seal. We are reporting this first and hope to have it put on record. Please also notify the relevant authorities to handle the matter accordingly. This association also intends to make a formal announcement immediately for the benefit of merchants. We will report other cases in accordance with regulations. Chairman Tang Shoumin of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Trends in Essential Goods</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association in Shanghai, the control of materials has gradually strengthened. Sugar and charcoal have been rationed since the 11th. In the future, the control of all essential goods for stabilizing people's livelihoods will gradually be strengthened. Here is a classified explanation of the control of livelihood materials.</p>
<p>Cigarettes</p>
<p>The control of cigarettes has been in place for more than three years, but it cannot be said to be in the most perfect state. Various organizations have been reformed in the meantime, but all have failed. At the end of last year, the China Tobacco Distribution Association, the previous control organization, was dissolved, and a Sino-Japanese joint venture, the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, was established to correct the shortcomings of past control. Rational control in the future is very promising. The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association was established in October of the 15th year of Showa. Its task was to prevent the flow of cigarettes into enemy areas, and to regulate sales and prices between Shanghai and the interior.</p>
<p>However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the tobacco industry, which had been monopolized by Britain and the United States, was transferred to Japanese management and controlled by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association. The Chinese side still entrusted the former general agent, Yongtaihe, to handle the matter. The Japanese side managed retail sales through the Tobacco Retail Trade Association. Because of the changing economic situation, cooperation in production was urgently needed, so the merger of Chinese and Japanese tobacco merchants was realized.</p>
<p>In January of last year, the China Tobacco Innovation Company was established to absorb and merge six major Japanese cigarette companies: Toyo Leaf Tobacco, East Asia Tobacco Innovation, Xingya Tobacco, North China Tobacco, and Wuhan Huacheng Tobacco. The Chinese side also established a Chamber of Commerce Tobacco Association Office to be responsible for controlling production and sales, negotiating prices, and jointly purchasing raw materials.</p>
<p>Although there was such an organization for production and sales, the sales situation remained chaotic, and the black market continued. This was because the two sides of production and sales could not be fully connected. At the same time, the failure to thoroughly control sales on the Chinese side was also a reason. Although the Japanese side tried its best to maintain the official price, it instead created speculation in the concession area, and prices continued to rise.</p>
<p>This situation could not be allowed to spread, of course. In order to establish a consistent production and sales control mechanism and maintain official prices, the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association was dissolved in December of last year, and the Sino-Japanese joint venture, the Central China Tobacco Innovation Distribution Association, was established to plan all production and sales matters across the board.</p>
<p>Another point of concern for everyone is how much the number of Chinese tobacco firms will be reorganized and reduced. The reason is that if these tobacco firms cannot be controlled, then the new order in the tobacco industry may not be hopeful. The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association plans to reorganize and reduce it to two-thirds of its current number.</p>

<h3>Go Away, Echo!</h3>
<p>— Someone</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>I have been sent back to my hometown.</p>
<p>The exhausting, bone-wearying labor, the shadowy and strange, foul-smelling air, are luxuries I can no longer afford. The turbulent and unstable overall situation, and the difficulty in obtaining food, have also determined my fate. The owner said to me, "You are no longer needed here, go back home!"</p>
<p>Three years of diligent learning, ending like this! I have already lost two fingers, a man with incomplete fingers! Must I bear this terrifying, crippled hand, and return home bitterly to face my fellow villagers?</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I entered the factory. Mr. Lian, a fellow villager and elder, was then a runner in the factory. He led me into the factory, incessantly telling me many of the factory's rules on the way. I listened, understanding some and not understanding others; watching his gray-white bearded chin, moving up and down as if something was rolling in his mouth, the spittle flying everywhere, I found it very amusing. But one sentence stuck in my mind, and I still remember it to this day:</p>
<p>"Ah Gui, you are no longer a child. When you get there, you must learn well. Your entire career is here!"</p>
<p>I am no longer a child! Although still young.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>After the apprenticeship ceremony, the factory owner (who was also my teacher), called over a person and said, "He Cheng, take him to the machine room and don't bully him!" He was a boy a year older than me, also an apprentice, thin and agile. According to him, the master never entered the machine room, and wouldn't even do anything himself; apprentices had to practice and learn on their own.</p>
<p>The factory was divided into two departments: flashlight and battery. In the flashlight department, there were six workers, specializing in making the flashlight body and parts. Assembling the lights was contracted out to others. In the battery department, there was one engineer, and two assistants, who were his students, specializing in helping him handle chemical matters. Other work was all done by female workers. They were all paid by the day and did not live in the factory. There were four apprentices in the factory, including me, all children of about the same age; He Cheng was considered the most senior. The chubby Yuan He, and "Youtiao" He Chun, worked upstairs in the battery department, while He Cheng and I were downstairs in the machine room. Ah Chun liked to buy Youtiao (fried dough sticks) for others, hence his strange nickname. (It also symbolized his thin and long body!)</p>
<p>Due to my peculiar accent, they would laugh whenever I spoke, and sometimes even deliberately asked me to say tongue-twisting words. Soon, I also got a nickname, called "Little Jiangbei."</p>
<p>The number of machines was very small. It was only later that I could identify what a lathe, planer, shaper, etc., were. The huge flywheel, driven by a belt, spun incessantly, making a "whooshing" roar, interspersed with the clanging sounds of the machines; "Bada bada," crisp and rapid. I saw several dark, rough hands moving between the machine dies. The upper die came down, the hand left the lower die, the upper die bounced back up, and the hand inserted another copper piece into the die. Then the stamped copper pieces poured out from behind the die, one by one, gathering in a basket. He Cheng told me that if the upper die hit your finger, it would surely be crushed into a cake; I couldn't help but break into a cold sweat. But seeing the workers so calm and at ease, even having the mood to joke with their neighbors, I couldn't help but be amazed. Their hands were as if they had eyes.</p>
<p>At first, I only did some simple work: passing tools, collecting scraps, counting numbers, and sometimes buying cigarettes for the workers, buying wine or other things for the "Young Master" – he was the factory director's nephew, also the highest-ranking employee in the factory, in charge of accounting and also supervising the work. People called him "Young Master." – These, it was said, also had to be learned.</p>
<p>Gradually, I was also able to hold scissors and pliers. He Cheng said that everything had to be tried out on your own; no one would teach you. Therefore, I wanted to try everything myself, seeing how purely and skillfully they worked with the machines, and how accustomed they were, I couldn't help but envy them. Someone on the shear machine went to urinate, so I took his place while he was away; this was not difficult, as long as the copper or iron sheet was aligned with the template, and you stepped on it. Look! I could do it too, just a little slower. When the person returned, he didn't blame me, but looked at what I had done and said, "If you like stepping, then do it for me." So I worked for him, stepping until my legs ached and I complained, but he just smoked and smiled to the side.</p>
<p>He Cheng was much more capable than me. He could replace anyone in anything, except for repairing the machine dies (that was naturally the job of the machinist). Once he asked me to try stepping on a mold. I was afraid of crushing my fingers, but he laughed at my timidity, and told me to first remove my hand from the mold before stepping on it. The principle was similar to the shear machine. I tried to do it slowly, and it worked.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Suddenly, the situation changed, external routes were cut off, and the factory's products could not be sold to other places, so it could only reduce its scale. Relying solely on the local area, honestly speaking, a flashlight factory could hardly stand. Gradually, workers were laid off, and the flashlight department stopped work; then the engineer resigned, and the battery department also shut down. The factory was then left with only a few apprentices, very quiet and still.</p>
<p>Soon, the factory changed its direction, manufacturing paper clips; because they had a market. The factory director's mind was very quick; as long as he heard there was a profit to be made, he would do it. It was also very grand, as he claimed to be maintaining the livelihood of the workers; but in reality, it was hard on us apprentices, because not many workers were added, but the apprentices were assigned to enough places of need: we had to do everything, day and night without rest.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in this hectic and arduous work, I learned a lot. The "Young Master" no longer thought my work was not up to par, and only urged me to do it faster.</p>
<p>In less than two months, the market for paper clips narrowed, and the factory switched to making copper caps; those were the necks of small light bulbs (small light bulbs). Because of the enthusiastic orders, day and night shifts were started up again. And so my misfortune came.</p>
<p>Copper caps, those cylindrical little things, had to be punched out one by one from the machine. After the things were shaped, they had to be placed one by one on the mold to be embossed with line patterns, so the hand had to constantly enter and exit the mold to escape danger. In addition, because of the violent vibrations, the mold would often break, sometimes the upper die would not go down, and sometimes the upper and lower dies would bite together and not bounce up.</p>
<p>In order to save expenses, the factory only used two old machinists, and we had no salary. However, whether it was cutting, stamping, or tidying up, most of the work was done by us. The main responsibility of the two machinists was only to repair the molds and give guidance. So we were all exhausted, while they were free to chat and laugh.</p>
<p>Once, the machine I was stepping on broke down, and the two machinists were not around. The upper die was easily lifted up, but could not be stepped down. I looked at He Cheng. He was on my right, stepping very smoothly, and the caps slid into the basket one by one behind the machine. I coughed dryly and stepped down with all my might, but forgot to take my hand out. The upper die suddenly fell down. I only escaped with my right hand, and the pain made me faint. I only heard a commotion in my ear, and then I didn't know anything anymore.</p>
<p>I gradually regained consciousness and found that I was in the labor hospital, with He Cheng accompanying me.</p>
<p>The doctor said to me, "The index finger and thumb of your left hand are only missing a section, it doesn't matter." Doesn't matter? I am already a disabled person!</p>
<p>While lying in the loft, only He Cheng would occasionally take the time to comfort me.</p>
<p>"Why are you sad?" Seeing that I was always frowning, He Cheng asked, trying to comfort me.</p>
<p>"Is there anything more hateful than being disabled? How can I face people?"</p>
<p>"For us who learn crafts, losing a few fingers is a common thing. Those who haven't been injured aren't considered old machinists." He Cheng deliberately consoled me. Then he told me about several familiar machinists, all of whom had incomplete little fingers.</p>
<p>The wound gradually healed, and the new skin covered it, like two bald monk heads, round and smooth. The shortened two sections could no longer grow back.</p>
<p>Time is truly a painful comforter. Gradually, my feelings of regret were not as strong as they used to be, although seeing the two bald heads still made me feel bad.</p>
<p>What's done is done. I can only hope for the future, the near future, to become an outstanding machinist; look, the scar of the crippled finger is a sign of success! I can only think like this. So I immersed myself in work with a fiery heart again.</p>
<p>But the factory's closure was like a bolt from the blue, shattering my only glimmer of hope. Who should I hate? "This is your lifelong career, you must learn well!" The old voice was still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>Go back home. My fate must not be in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>I Am Even Thinner</h3>
<p>— Weng</p>
<p>The hour hand is pointing at six, and my colleagues have already gone home one after another. Finally, it should be my turn.</p>
<p>After arranging everything, I dragged my tired body and walked on my way home. The three bowls of thin porridge I had for lunch had long been digested in my stomach. On the road, I saw fragrant and crispy cakes, but my pockets were empty and I didn't have a penny on me, so I could only swallow my saliva, turn my head and continue walking forward.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×!" A familiar voice came from behind me, and I turned my head as if waking from a dream and looked back. It turned out to be one of my students.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×! How are you?" he came up to me and said.</p>
<p>I reluctantly relaxed my furrowed brow, gave a wry smile, and nodded, replying, "I'm okay."</p>
<p>Okay? Okay what? This question was spinning in my mind, and I couldn't think of anything good for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you still at that school this semester?" he continued to talk to me.</p>
<p>Who knew that the stomach in my belly was grumbling.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied weakly.</p>
<p>"I've now been admitted to ×× Middle School. Their tuition is really cheap, only half of yours. With your tuition so expensive, who can afford to go to your school. And..."</p>
<p>"—" I looked at him.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, I haven't seen you for more than a month. How did you get even thinner?" he suddenly thought of this.</p>
<p>"—" I didn't speak.</p>
<p>"Are you sick? Mr. ×," he asked me again.</p>
<p>Thin! Yes, I'm thin, even thinner than last year. Am I sick? No, I'm not sick, my body is still very good, but how did I get thin? I don't know.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not sick," I said, shaking my head, "Maybe my hair is longer, making me look thinner."</p>
<p>My belly was rumbling and grumbling endlessly, so I continued:</p>
<p>"It's getting late, let's see you again. When you have time, come to our school to play."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Mr. ×!" After saying that, he bowed.</p>
<p>We parted ways.</p>
<p>When I got home, my wife had already prepared the porridge and told me to eat. I quickly drank three bowls of the watery thin porridge.</p>
<p>After eating, I lay blankly on the bed, and my wife continued her needlework.</p>
<p>"Did the school pay you today?" she suddenly asked me this question.</p>
<p>"No!" I said weakly.</p>
<p>"Today is the end of the month, why haven't they paid you yet?"</p>
<p>"—"</p>
<p>"There's not a grain of rice left, what are we going to eat tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Can't you go and settle your wages tomorrow? Settle your wages and buy some corn to cook some porridge," I said.</p>
<p>"The wages have already been settled. There's no more work on hand, how can I go and settle my wages again?"</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. I just connected my two eyebrows tightly.</p>
<p>"How did you get even thinner?" The question the student I had just met on the road asked, floated into my mind again.</p>
<p>Thinner, indeed much thinner than last year. When the last semester just started, my wife and I, with the little income we earned through hard work, could still manage to have a meal; but recently it's gradually become impossible, prices are soaring endlessly, but our income hasn't risen with it, it's just that little bit. As a result, in recent months, we haven't even been able to eat rice, we eat porridge every day, and the porridge is gradually becoming thinner.</p>
<p>It's another semester. Tuition has doubled, and I don't know if the salary can be doubled. Even if it's doubled, whether it's enough is still a problem; moreover, my wife's belly stubbornly refuses to behave, and I watch it grow bigger day by day. Counting the days, it's not far from the day the child is born. There's also the clothes on my body, which are so tattered that they can hardly be worn anymore.</p>
<p>This series of thoughts turned over and over in my mind, and I couldn't find a way to analyze them.</p>
<p>"Oh! What will we do when the child is born?" My wife paused for a while, seeing that I didn't say a word, and opened the conversation first.</p>
<p>I lay on the bed, silent all the time, staring at the light hanging on the ceiling. Suddenly the light gradually dimmed, I couldn't see the light clearly, my eyes were wet, and tears began to flow out, dripping onto the pillow after passing my cheeks.</p>
<p>My wife is going to give birth, and there are no old women in the family who can help and guide, so of course it's much safer to go to the hospital, but where is the money for the hospital expenses?</p>
<p>"Your summer gown is already so tattered that it's beyond repair, and you can't wear it anymore, are you going to make a new one?" Seeing that I didn't speak, she changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Pawn it," I said, continuing to maintain my silence, only planning in my heart.</p>
<p>A gown is indispensable, especially for teachers, it is even more indispensable.</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, I couldn't find a way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>"I don't want to think about it anymore! Take off my clothes and go to sleep! Let's talk about it tomorrow!"</p>
<p>I said to myself, taking off my clothes and going to sleep.</p>
<h3>Spring Memories</h3>
<p>— Sha Yun</p>
<p>Casually recalling the fragrance of early spring, this fragrance has the radish flavor of Tongqiao (Copper Bridge) in my hometown; I am afraid to think of the spring in my hometown, because I am afraid that I will see it again in my dreams:</p>
<p>Mother's loving eyes. Kites filling the sky above the ancient wall and in the fields, Mom, you are again at the foot of the sun, chatting with Aunt Li by the fence about a tragic story. In the spring night, I can still distinguish my mother's laughter, tonight is a good moon, Mom, are you reminiscing about the quiet bell sound in the ancient temple?</p>
<h3>In Praise of Color</h3>
<p>— He Wen</p>
<p>In this universe, every color has its power, just as the poets say: "Color is something that can be seen, smelled, tasted, and heard!"</p>
<p>Not only can aesthetic poets find purity and light in white, and feel sorrow and pain in black, they can also hear the sound of harps in white, discover the sound of flutes in yellow, and see black, as if countless piano keys are dancing before their eyes.</p>
<p>If you are not colorblind, your life will at least be affected by pigments to some extent. Various beautiful or mixed colors can control your mood, even your soul; it can give you happiness, but it can also make you sad and disappointed!</p>
<p>A pessimistic person nearing the end of his life told people: in his environment, all he sees is a deathly gray-white: pale faces, gray-white hair, white walls, vast gray fields, gray-white light... So everything around him is dyed gray-white, and the bleak white becomes the cause of his melancholy.</p>
<p>When prisoners are sent to a dark prison, they will think that the whole world is dark, and their hearts will become increasingly cold and blurred.</p>
<p>Many unbearably vulgar colors often pollute people's souls, producing all kinds of crimes. Bright, beautiful, and dazzling colors are rippling, bright red lights, emerald green wine, light red rouge with a charming smell, and the dreamy clear yellow gold, sparkling silver white... dazzling people's hazy eyes, blinding their reason... So they do not hesitate to harm others, ruin their future days, and try to pursue intense colors, pursue the endless satisfaction of desires, pursue evil...</p>
<p>Young people have fallen, old people have despaired, criminals do not know repentance, and decadent people destroy themselves. This is all due to the temptation of color, the stimulation of color, and the bondage of color.</p>
<p>Some people love to find the power of life in color, the brilliant golden morning light makes people cherish their youth more, under the brightly colored banner, everyone will strive and cheer up; sky blue clothing makes people feel solemn; palaces painted in gold and vermilion make people feel magnificent, and colorful paintings, beautiful art, give us the ability to further recognize humanity's artistic creativity!</p>
<p>The world relies entirely on the melody of color, the harmony of color, bringing progress, and harmony among people relies on the harmony of color, the vibrancy of color, bringing warmth and passion!</p>
<p>We need pure pigments, which are the colors of truth and beauty. People love to appreciate all kinds of colors in nature, which are so simple and elegant, without the slightest bit of false rendering!</p>
<p>The azure sky, the vast white clouds, the green mountains, and the green water, are all as pure as virgins. Purple grapes, milky white lilacs, light red roses, are certainly the characteristics of the universe, but green grasslands and golden wheat fields are equally lovely. Facing the beauty of the universe, everyone is willing to give up all extravagant hopes and seek a simple world.</p>
<p>The pigments in the universe are matched so appropriately that there are never any errors or flaws, and they can inspire the wisdom of appreciators and admirers. Why does a black swallow have a red beak, why can red flowers be drawn out from the tender green leaves? These are all questions between the ordinary and the extraordinary.</p>
<p>In fact, everything in nature never contains mystery, you have to observe carefully and think patiently, and it will always give you various new inspirations.</p>
<p>The change of color dominates everything in the world, and the vibration of color controls the fate of mankind!</p>
<p>Everyone has a favorite color to represent their personality and temperament. Melancholy women wear plain clothes all year round, greedy merchants also love purple sauce color, insidious people often like gray-black, brave people pursue bright red, and upright people love white.</p>
<p>The colors needed by young people are completely different from those needed by old people. Young people can find vitality and life in color, while old people merge the pigments they come into contact with into a shallow state of mind!</p>
<p>I say: everyone's life will also reflect a color, some lives are red, blue, and some are gray, yellow, white, black...</p>
<p>Our lives cannot be without various pigments, but over-indulging in strong colors, having tasted the world's weariness, and losing the taste of true life. Not needing a bit of color will lead to lonely and empty days! Unable to understand the true meaning of life. Only those who know how to match and regulate pure pigments have a fulfilling life!</p>
<p>Because of the various pigments, we do not live in a monotonous world!</p>
