<p>社評</p>
<h3>青年節獻詞</h3>
<p>最近國民政府命令，每年五月五日爲「靑年節」，在此國際形勢日趨嚴重，東亞民族共同擊滅英美的時候，當局這一個決定，實有重大的意義，足見當局對於靑年在新時代中所處地位的重視，和對於靑年期望之殷切。從世界的現勢來看，爲了爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，爲了建設東亞乃至世界的新秩序，固然非期待靑年們熱烈參加不可；從國家的立塲說，不僅是今日實際的參戰，必須全國靑年力量之總動員，而且將來建設新中國，也非儘速開始有計劃的訓練靑年不可。而所有這些，主要是要全國靑年的自覺和自發的奮鬥。政府當局之明定「靑年節」，應該就是喚醒全國靑年振作起來的第一聲。</p>
<p>中國靑年，在歷史上早有光榮的奮鬥史績，無論是誰，都不能再輕視中國靑年對於國家民族命運的決定力量。但是，也無庸諱言的，過去曾有少數野心家利用靑年們的熱情，天眞，坦白和英勇，而替他們少數人造地位，作犧牲。同時，關於靑年本身的團，靑年本身的進步和靑年對國家民族的應有地位，却不加注意與扶助，甚至於不惜加以破壞和壓迫。無數有爲的靑年們，曾經無辜斷送了，犧牲了，使國家民族的元氣大受打擊。我們痛定思痛，乘此第一屆靑年節，敬爲全國靑年請命，願當局與社會上下一致愛護靑年，給靑年們能夠團結，能求進步，能爲國家社會盡力。</p>
<p>我們希望於全國靑年者，是要鑒於目前時代的嚴重局面，和國家民族的嚴重地位，認識靑年對於國家民族未來命運的決定力量，人人不再自暴自棄，人人從此自尊自愛，人人要準備做國家的主人翁，做改造社會建設新中國的先鋒。其次，我們再不容許一般靑年不問時事，因而浪漫頹廢，或是死讀書，讀死書；我們更不能再消極悲觀，而要切實振作，關心國事，擔負起自己對祖國的責任。再次，我們更希望認淸目前東亞與我國的迫急需要，大家加倍努力，研究科學技術，展開科學運動，推進技術學習，鍜鍊成鋼鐵一樣的隊伍，眞正的做改造社會的先鋒，做建設新中國的幹部，完成大東亞乃至世界新秩序的大業！</p>
<h3>與國同壽</h3>
<p>在主席秉天賦之才具與膽識，追隨孫先生獻身革命事業者，歷時數十年，其間經歷了幾許艱險，幾許波折，足以書之史册而表彰者，我們暫且不說。我們試瞑目一想，如果中日事變延至今日，而中間無主席的艷電發表主張和運，那末最近友邦日本的對華新政策便不會產生。我們更推想主席當時發動和運的決心，簡直抱着「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的勇氣，而有此英奮行爲，因此，我們於內心敬祝主席與國同壽之餘，表示敬仰的第一點。</p>
<p>我國的習禮，年至花甲。可以稱壽；而社會一般習慣，稍有財勢者，雖三十四十，輒盛行祝壽，以炫闊綽。今主席壽已六秩晋一，畢生事業彪炳，慶壽原非鋪張，而主席自始即行謝絕，並以厲行節的，矯正習俗爲言。我們感於節的確爲目前全體國民最當切實厲行的一事。節的的結果，可以减少物資的消費，同時就是消極的增加物資的運用。所以「節的」兩字，驟視之，似乎無關宏指的「做人家」的小節；其實一切有關國計民生的政治，經濟，以至於社會文化諸大問題，莫不與此有重大的關係；尤其是我們在對外作戰的時候，物資困難，物價高漲，一般生活困苦的時候，更不能不切實厲行節的，以增益作戰需用的物資，以穩定物價的高漲，以解舒生活的困苦，不過，我們要大聲呼籲的，一般受生活困苦的大衆，對於生活消費，早已節的至無可再節了，惟有中上階層份子，必須一律厲行節的。同時更盼望以他們節約之剩餘，供給受生活困苦的大衆，我們此言，實在因爲看透目前上海社會「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」的現象太多了。我們認爲主席特別提出節的的用意，亦不外乎此，這是我們表示敬仰的第二點。</p>
<p>我們知道　主席公務鞅掌，日理萬機，而早六時即興，夜十一時始寢，仍精神飽滿，因此，更可證明愈勤勞，則愈健康。返觀一部分官塲中人，時至深夜，仍追逐於燈紅酒綠塲所，且精神「煥發」，迨至翌日，已日上三竿，仍高枕無憂，不守辦公時間，雖到亦萎靡不振，相形之下，能無愧疚！進一步說，領導人物，雖夙夜辛勤國事，畢竟獨木難支大厦，惟有全部公務人員，尤其中高級幹部，個個以　主席之辦事精神爲模範，一致努力，然後政治才能修明，國家才可復興，這是我們表示敬仰的第三點。</p>
<p>我們當領會主席謝絕祝壽的至意，更當體會厲行節的矯正習俗的眞諦，我們內心表示默慶主席與國同壽，爲我們全國人民永恒服務。昨天原爲主席的誕辰，我們仰體主席的用心，未曾以隻字言慶，而避冒凟。但願於今天事後表示內心的敬崇，並申引厲行節的之義，以與國人同祝主席與國同壽。</p>

<h3>日本海軍航空部隊　白畫空襲達爾文港　予反軸心空軍以極大打撃　印度孟加拉機塲亦遭轟炸</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城四日中央社電日海軍航空部隊，二日晝大舉空襲達爾文港，於空戰中予反軸心空軍以極大打擊，澳洲朝野頗爲震驚，一般軍事專門家對日海軍航空隊之優秀，亦莫不驚愕。據墨爾鉢來電，反軸心軍司令部二日夜發表聲明稱，日軍航空部隊二日於達爾文港地區及北方亞拉佛拉海上空，與反軸心空軍展開空戰，反軸心空軍損害甚大。又反軸心軍司令部全衆社特派員就此次空戰情形談稱：日軍航空部隊二日猛炸達爾文港附近反軸心軍飛機塲，反軸心空軍於空戰中受重創，英·澳人駕駛之噴火式機，雖曾與日機交戰，然所蒙損害甚大。反軸心軍司令部此次發表，承認西南太平洋空戰損害甚大，尙係初次又英中央廣播電台墨爾鉢特派員亦稱：反軸心軍過去尙未蒙受此種重大損害，然噴火式機若果係由於歐洲戰綫與德空軍交戰之英·奧駛員駕駛，則致敗之原因更不可解。過去因非洲戰綫緊迫，未能輸入噴火式機，而最近運到者，均係最新式之噴火式機，故此次敗北實出意外。日軍航空部隊之駕駛員及飛機，必爲最優秀者。又澳洲電台廣播稱，噴火式機乃世界最優秀之戰鬥機，然於此次之空戰中，以日機爲對手，竟遭重創。按噴火式機高空飛行較其他型機爲優，而駕駛員又均係最近與飛機同時轉來澳洲之英·澳飛行士，而此次慘敗，實不可解。麥克沃塞向以揑造事實聞名，傳此次爲指出太平洋之危機，或將放棄其過去之欺瞞政策，不得不承認此次之慘敗，</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電據昨日新德里所發表之公報，孟加拉省東南部之機塲，曾遭”機轟炸，稍有傷亡與損害，並有英機一架失蹤。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城四日中央社電日軍航空部隊大舉轟炸達爾文港及日潛艇於南太平洋方面之活躍，似予澳洲以極大衝動。據墨爾缽來電，澳陸相福特二十二日曾發表談話，向英·美兩國乞援，大意謂，吾人要求英·美兩國對南太平洋戰綫大量輸送船舶，飛機及軍隊等，最近日軍於南太平洋增强潛艇實力，日本企圖切斷澳洲之交通綫，我方運輸船因遭日潛艇襲擊，損失日增，徵諸日潛艇之活動與此次日航空部隊轟炸達爾文港，即可明瞭日本現已展開攻勢。</p>

<h3>囤積主要商品　治罪條例之解釋</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　三日上午之最高國防會議，一致通過囤積商品治罪條例，並即以政府命令公佈，條例內容，計共十二條，業見刊載，第一二兩條之目的，在於保護主要商品同業公會會員之正當商業行爲，及資本不滿千元之小販』買賣，明定對達反者，科以刑罰，亦即「非主要商品同業公會會員，而以營利爲目的囤積主要商品時，即處以三年以上，七年以下有期徒刑，同時並得併科以五萬元以下之罰金」。於第二條中，復規定同業公會會員之買賣對象，應爲眞正之直接消費者，然對於農業生產者出賣其生產之農作物，或依法取得牙行或經紀人之資格者，則不受此限制，此屬當然。第三條爲規定同業公會會員，對主管官廳，及同業公會之義務，其匿不登記者亦附以法定處分。第四條乃對違反第二三各條犯罪者之附帶處分，人則執行刑罰，物則予以沒收。第五條乃對以金錢爲手段，使人犯罪者，亦經條例明定爲共犯。第六條之規定，對因犯一二三各條而致擾亂市塲者，不惜規定嚴厲刑法，故條文中有處死刑或無期徒刑，並併科十萬元以下罰金之規定。第七條，爲單獨以處罰公務員犯罪爲對象，雖身爲國家官吏，其犯罪處分亦絕不稍加寬恕，立法之本意有肅正綱紀之意在內。第八九兩條，乃予過去囤積者以自新之路。第十條，又明定對公務員不適用第八九兩條第一項之規定，由此可見政府對公務員犯罪之處置，有較一般人更加嚴厲之決心。第十一條，則爲規定公會會員資格，綜觀全條例，含有以下各意義：（一）立戰時經濟體制之法的根據，確實執行戰時經濟政策，（二）保障主要商品同業會員，及小販之正當商業行爲，（三）明定營利目有，應爲合法的及公的性格，（四）對犯罪者，不惜予以最嚴厲處分，公務員亦同，（五）以法律予過去囤積者以自新之路，惟對公務員則採取嚴厲處置，（六）肅正綱紀實行廉潔政治，（七）本條例實行後，政府對條例之執行，已具有决心，今後對囤積者，固將予以嚴厲之制裁，民生之安定，物價之平定，亦必因本法而生有好影響，國民應一體舉行，並應互行監察，努力檢舉犯罪，共同完成戰時體制，以復興中國。</p>

<p>香港三日中央社電　香港磯谷總督，三日曾會見華人記者團，答覆香港目下之種種問題，並說明香港現仍許可英國管下時代之港幣流通之理由，其談話要旨如下：香港一般市民生活，現已日趨安定，因爲港幣與軍票之兌換限制，致使交易及市民生活，均有許多不便，現因軍票準備已極充分，故乃將此兌換限制，予以取消，港幣之萎縮乃當然之趨勢，本來港幣之生命，早巳應當告終，現仍許可英國管下時代之港幣流通於香港，本質上本不合理，然爲顧及一般市民生活，乃許其暫時流通耳。</p>

<h3>五五青年節之意義</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<p>國民政府定每年五月五日爲靑年節，是具有意義的，四月四日是兒童節，六月六日是敎師節，介於這兩節之間，是靑年節最爲適當，而且在這時候，正是新綠彌漫，萬里山河，都添上一層蓬蓬勃勃的淸新活潑的氣象，以之象微靑年，更是貼切不過。</p>
<p>說到歷史，元年一月一日，是國父在南京就職臨時大總統的紀念日，十年五月五日，是國父在廣州就職大總統的紀念日，前者關係中華民國的開創，後者關係中華民國的復興。迥想當時，全國之內，軍閥割據，暗無天日，卽以廣州而論，也還在反革命勢力醞釀爆發之中，國父不忍國民革命的中斷，在萬分惡劣的環境裏，擔負起復興中華民國的重任，這種只知正誼明道不計成敗利鈍的堅苦卓絕的精神，眞是一股靑年的最高模範。當時還有些人，以國會未足法定人數爲言，須知自六年督軍團作反違背的法解散國會以來，所謂護法，其根本精神在打倒督軍團，旣然要打倒護法的對象督軍團，便不可無護法的主體中華民國政府，這種根本精神的重要，較之形式，何止萬倍。無如當時許多人還泥於形式而忽略了根本精神，以致十一年間，爲督軍團所利用，在北京恢復國會，十二年間這恢復了的國會，便替督軍團的首領曹錕捧塲，每一個議員，以數萬元一票以至數千元一票不等，選舉曹錕做大總統，從此國會便墜入泥　地獄去了。這因爲根本精神已經消失，留着軀壳，自然歸於腐爛，許多人雖然追悔，巳經無及了。由此可知，歷史的進步，全憑着根本精神，形式可變，根本精神不可變，我們舉行青年節的時候，想起靑年節的日子，也就是　國父擔負起復與中華民國的重大責任的日子，我們應該直的幹下去。</p>
<p>再說到更舊的歷史，陰歷的五月五日，是端午節，相傳戰國時候，有一個屈原於是日自沉於汨維，屈原的列傳見於史記，其文辭見於離騷。本來自殺是消極的行爲，不足取法的，但是我們讀了史記列傳，讀了離騷可以領略出屈原的苦心。顧亭林日知錄有兩段說得最好，現在手邊沒有日知錄將其大槪，記出如下：讀屈子離騷之篇，乃知堯以行出乎人者，以其耿介，同乎流俗，合乎污世，則不可與入堯舜之道矣。</p>
<p>老氏之學，所以異於孔子者，和其光，同其塵，此所謂似是而非也，卜居漁父盡之矣，非不知其言之可從也，而義有所不當爲也，子雲而知此義也，反離騷其可不作矣，尋其大指，生斯世也，爲斯世也，善斯可矣，此其所以爲莽大夫歟。</p>
<p>以上兩段，大義是說，一個人要信道篤而自知明，不可爲環境所屈服，像屈原這樣寗死不爲流俗污世所屈，是值得佩服的，如果他不是自殺而死，而是革命而死，那就完全了，然即此寗死不屈的精神，已經難得。一般靑年，信道要篤，操守要堅，必須這樣，纔能建立自己，改造社會，屈原能惡俗所屈，是値得佩服的們還要更進一步，與惡俗奮鬥，戰勝惡俗，改造一個光明純潔的社會。</p>
<p>從前端午節，紀念屈原有一個辦法，便是龍舟競渡，龍舟是古時的工具，競渡的精神，郤是今古如一的，幾十個人，在一條船上，一齊努力，與其他的船，爭向前進，這種競爭，是相摩相厲促成進步的競爭，這種競爭精神，在歷史進步的意義上，在社會進化的意義上，是很重要的。</p>
<p>以上是因如今靑年節，而聯想到以前的端午節，隨便附帶的幾句話。</p>
<p>總而言之，一般靑年，在這時代，應該認定復與中華保衛東亞的使命，以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進的精神，担當一切。當度着靑年節的時候，想起十年五月五日國父就任大總統時那一種艱難奮鬥的苦心毅力，加重了我們承先啟後的心事，誓當繼續努力，以貫徹國父生平未竟之志，同時聯想起古代一段美麗的歷史，也就可歌可泣所謂百世之下，聞風興起，我們應該鼓起蓬蓬勃勃淸鮮活潑的朝氣大踏步往前進。</p>

<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社所獲最後消息，倫敦及華盛頓方面，對於蘇·波兩國絕交後之局勢，仍認爲嚴重。英·美報紙之態度，對蘇·波兩方皆似不滿，美國方面最近舉行加祿普測騐時之問題，爲「汝以爲蘇聯在戰後將忠誠合作否？」其答案有百分之五十爲否。此舉實使莫斯科方面大爲不悅。</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　蘇塔斯社昨晚聲述，主張將西哥斯基政府全部改組，一面譴責西哥斯基將軍與波蘭流亡人民之反動份子互通聲氣，并在美國方面作反蘇性質之讓步。該社續謂，波蘭現需要一新的政府，其人員對戰時需要有深切之了解，對波人與反軸心國能負起充分的責任，該新政府目不致淪爲致敵之工具，而願與蘇聯謀友誼的結合。該社末謂，組織新政府之先决條件中爲排斥獨佔烏克蘭之政策，蓋莫斯科深期該新政府能以友好態度解决邊界問題。</p>

<h3>保國前警察總監　潘蒂夫被刺殞命</h3>
<p>索非亞四日中央社電　保加利亞前任警察總監潘蒂夫上校，昨日下午一時二十五分，被人開槍擊斃。兇手係男女兩人。當局方面認爲此案有政治背景，本案之經過情形如下：兇手先伏於潘蒂夫寓所之梯下，見其出門，即連開兩槍，均中頭部，數分鍾即行氣絕，有二人目擊吐事，曾追捕兇手，但終未擒獲，警察旋即趕到並立即開始偵查。按潘蒂夫係著名軍事法官，現年五十歲，一九二九年二月至一九四一年十一月時，曾任保國警察總監，旋被任爲軍事上訴法庭法官，惟辭而未就，遂執行律務。衆信本案兇手，係與二月間刺殺前陸長　柯夫將軍及四月十五日刺殺國會外交委員會主席雅尼夫之兇手，同屬一恐怖團體。潘蒂夫在任警察總監時，曾鬥，頗爲知名。</p>
<h3>德蘇兩軍完成編配　正準備今夏大戰　庫班河德羅聯軍猛烈反攻</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　莫斯科方面傳不久或將在東綫發動主要攻擊，柏林方面則謂，蘇軍在庫班地區軸心橋頭堡之東面側翼所作之大規模攻擊，星期日已轉微弱。據德國新聞社訊，蘇軍於過去數日間在庫班河之南損失數師及數連隊暨許多坦克車，後又增派數營軍隊作戰，但德·羅聯軍與强有力之德空軍合作開始猛烈反攻，經猛烈之戰鬥後，即將來攻之蘇軍包圍，除俘獲，其少數外，餘皆加以殲滅，據云，某處之蘇軍並未抵抗，卽棄械投降。柏林方面對於該地區之作戰，並未有所預言，德國軍事專家僅指出，蘇軍仍繼續作猛烈之攻擊，但戰事已否達到最高潮則尚未能言。同時合衆社駐莫斯科特派記者稱：德·蘇兩軍皆顯已沿戰綫完成其重行編配，以準備本年夏季之大戰。高加索西北部亦曾發生大規模之戰鬥數次。</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據東綫消息，蘇軍於庫班河展開之攻勢，轉見微弱，而德軍之反攻反日益熾烈，尤以諾伏洛西斯克方面，德軍正繼續進攻，展開殲滅戰，據德國新聞社消息稱：傳蘇軍於二日喪失戰車十六輛，飛機二十一架，蘇軍戰力低下之情形，於此可見一斑，又據合衆社莫斯科電，德·蘇兩軍頃已將全綫兵同整備完畢，現正以砲戰準備發動熾烈之攻勢，傳伏朗尼悉地區兩軍頃已開始前哨戰。</p>
<p>莫斯科四日中央社電　紅軍在德方橋頭堡方面加重壓迫後，刻正與德·羅混合軍隊血戰中。據前綫消息，以前德方之反攻顯已失敗，蘇方公報對庫班戰事未曾提及，僅謂在卡科夫東南五十英里之蘇方橋頭堡博羅克里亞周圍仍有戰事。在其他地點，蘇方大砲及偵查機正索探德軍陣地，以爲最後决戰之準備，衆意德方未來之攻勢，將給蘇京以大打擊，奧萊爾將爲全綫之中心，緣德方藉其兇猛之坦克車有恃無恐，軍事評論家梵西里夫中校謂，「未來之戰役，必屬艱苦非常」。</p>

<h3>美國煤礦工人　暫行復工半月</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據華盛頓消息，昨爲美礦工復工之第一日，情形殊欠踴躍，因實行恢復工作之礦工僅半數，其餘大約今日亦可復工。美礦工聯合會之職員，曾於星期日晚間羅斯福總統發表無綫電播音之前，宣布烟煤礦工將暫行復工十五天，以待增加工資談判之進行。內長依克斯昨曾宣布組織一五人委員會，以監督無烟煤礦之經營，加入罷工之八千無烟煤礦工人之契約，已於四月三十日午夜失效。華盛頓來訊，暗示官方對於此次罷工事，無公開討論者，惟一般意見似認爲除惟一可能之例外，任何解决煤業糾紛之協定，均將呈請戰時勞工局批准，此一例外，將爲每週六日第六日將獲額外之工資。同時據戰時勞工局人員發表，該局所指派之三人小組委員會，一俟煤業生產恢復原狀，即將重行開始工作，搜集事實並提出建議。礦工聯合會長路易斯係於星期晨與內長伊克斯協議後，當晚通令礦工復工十五天，氏曾允礦工，將儘量利用此兩週期間擬具一種工資新方法。勞工部長潘金斯批評此十五天復工協定云，此舉之意義，並非政府已接受罷工要求之謂。</p>
<h3>英勞工大臣公布　强徴工人法令</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　晚勞工大臣貝文氏宣布强徴工人之嚴厲章則，該宣吿謂，自五月八日起，政府有權徴募至五十歲爲止之男人，從事先前爲年靑者擔任之工作，俾年靑者得從事軍役。該通令並對四十五歲以上之婦女亦包括在內，彼等應以全部或一部份時間服務各重要戰時工業，惟幼童得免役。按刻下以一部分時間服務於戰時工業之已婚婦女，已有五十萬名，英方所剩之人力，即爲已婚婦女，故該通令將彼等包括在內。</p>
<h3>突尼西亞前綫　僅有局部戰鬥　反軸心國正集中運輸艦　傳係籌劃大規模登陸戰</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱：突尼西亞戰綫，星期日僅有局部戰鬥。自復活節之大戰後，戰事較爲沉寂，原因乃爲反軸心軍部隊尤其是英第一軍，確曾蒙受重大損失，但敵軍有極爲優越之人力及物力，故應能同時彌補此項損失。反軸心軍接近前綫之準備，固不足以補充此項損失，但反軸心軍在阿爾及利亞及摩洛哥有大量之準備，足以組織一軍而有餘，此乃公開之秘密。北非鐵道交通優民，反軸心軍儘可派遣充份之新部隊，以更替其曾受重創之部隊，但反軸心方面似尚未曾爲此。基於屢次所傳反軸心運輸艦大量集中於阿爾及利亞海港，或亦可作另一解釋，反軸心軍高級指揮之尚未將其準備之大部使用於北非作戰者，或係正在籌劃一大規模之登陸作戰，反軸心軍或正籌劃在突尼西亞海岸登陸，蓋彼等深知向軸心陣地作正面攻擊極爲困難，且必致蒙受極重之損失，但反軸心軍或亦正在計劃在西西里島或撒丁尼亞海岸登陸，亦未可知。</p>
<h3>佛羅烈達島洋面海戰全貌</h3>
<p>（南太平洋〇〇基地竹田特派員（海軍報道班員發）</p>
<p>四月七日的佛羅烈達島洋面海戰，其任務爲「攻擊加達爾卡納爾島四周的敵艦隊，（運輸船團爲主），粉碎敵的反攻企圖」。所收獲的戰果，計：擊沈，擊傷敵艦船十五只，擊墜敵機約四十架，這次海軍航空隊的奇製作戰，敵人實受到很大的打擊。這是先發制人的航空奇製作戰，在襲擊的時候，天時雖不良好，但我海軍航空隊的攻擊精神，完全克服這自然的惡劣環境，毅然飛臨加達爾卡納島上空，圓滿地擊毀了敵的補給船團，敵所恃爲精銳的格拉曼戰鬥機，次第被一一擊落。所以此役所費的時間極少，〇〇司令官及〇〇基地的報道班員，在此次戰役中，曾親自體騐了激烈的航空戰鬥。</p>
<p>出發</p>
<p>七日午前〇〇時，〇〇基地一帶，恰如暴風雨的前夕，天候極爲惡劣，在這黑闇的平原，有點點螢火，那是整備員的懷中電燈他們正在出擊之前，徹夜準備機械。螢火在黑暗中消失了，祇聽得呼呼地發動機試轉的聲音，驚破了酣夢。天空漸作魚白色，黑暗在光明之前低頭了。飛機突破了微暗的天色，飛起出發。待司令官所乘的領導機上昇至〇〇公尺的天空時，許多架飛機已經在列隊等候着，一起向漸漸明朗的晨曦的天空中，迅速向前飛翔。</p>
<p>海面的上空，漂浮着一片片的斷雲，飛行極爲平穩。一口氣飛行〇〇公里，我們所乘的領導和與攻擊機隊作別而在某前進根據地降陸，這時繁生着榔子林的所羅門羣島，充滿着朝氣，朝露沾濕了降陸的飛機。離開敵的最前綫基地「瓜島」僅〇〇公里，半年來敵我雙方在此地相持，反覆血戰。但在這晴朗的朝晨，看不見一點殺氣。</p>
<p>攻擊</p>
<p>不久這朝晨的靜寂便被打破了，頭上突然金屬性的爆音嗡嗡地作聲，敵人的洛基特偵察機在不可見的高度中飛去了。他們知道了我們要去攻擊了嗎？不能再有一小時的等待了，戰鬥轟炸的聯合攻擊大編隊立即飛昇至達爾卡納爾的上空。報道班員在椰子樹葉的下祈禱戰鬥部隊的武運，司令官則在立在不十分高的小山上，胸中充滿着必勝的信念，凝視着飛機飛過去的東南方天空。司令官知道這是艱難的攻擊，在白晝，我海軍機的勇士須衝入敵人傾其全力所築成的近代陣地，在那裏有數百架敵人的戰鬥機等待着，敵人佈置好了高角砲的重圍，這是何等艱巨的工作啊！</p>
<p>攻擊機隊中的某隊，首先從瓜島南方的海上，在層雲密佈中，向北岸的敵艦船集中地進發，可是該島上空一帶，一萬公尺以上的亂雲，極爲緊密，如欲穿雲而下，隊形勢必紊亂，那是策之最下者，於是改道迂回該島之西，達到西端時，敵人已經被我航空部隊的急襲驚覺，數十架格拉曼戰鬥機與猛烈的地上砲火，一齊應戰。</p>
<p>恰在瓜島西端的上空巡弋，全軍突襲的命令下來了。這時候，雲層之上，突然有四架格拉門戰鬥機向我戰鬥機部隊從上攻擊。〇〇隊長此時正預備着攻擊姿勢向他面攻擊，二架敵機偷偷從上空砰地降落，中國事變以來久歴戰陣的〇〇中尉，立即擊落其中之一，一面爲轟炸機開道，一面向敵飛行塲沿岸的上空突擊。那時候又有四架格拉曼機向我轟炸機攻擊。〇隊接到「突擊」的命令，首先衝來，轉瞬間已擊落其中的三架，還有一架，聽其逃亡，列隊再行突進。前面又有五架敵機對我同伴一小隊襲擊。這一隊敵機恃衆而頑强抵抗，僅擊落二架，其餘的委之於後續部隊，本隊則掩護轟炸機再行向東深入敵空。</p>
<p>轟炸機隊自西方迂回而向北岸的時候。曾經過敵戰鬥機的襲擊，地上的砲火亦極爲猛烈，故這一隊的飛機都多少受到幾顆敵彈，但仍不以爲意，向東進擊，在敵人飛行塲的附近，從雲層中見到數艘敵運輸船團正在左右移動，隊分爲二，一隊突入這船團，向雲端中所望見的船團驀地襲擊，敵防空砲火無目的地盲射，在震耳欲裂的炸聲中，急速下降擲下準確的炸彈，旋轉，船團四圍，開放防空砲火的敵驅逐艦，亦同被命中，冒起黑烟，漸漸沉沒。</p>
<p>另一隊轟炸機，更向東方前進搜索敵人，這時起，敵戰鬥機的攻擊，更加猛烈起來，前後，上下，盡是敵的砲火。在這敵彈的交錯中，遙遙地發見了巡洋艦與驅逐艦所護衛着的六艘運輸船，後面拖著一長條白的水尾，顯然想逃避我機的攻擊，同時艦船上的砲火仍向我機射擊。</p>
<p>轟炸機隊悠然從右迂回而左，由〇隊長機作先導，突入船團，集中於指揮機的砲火極其猛烈，天空頓時變成火海，先導的指揮機的左翼，終於被一彈貫穿起火，可是仍不顧一切。向一萬噸級的運輸船擲下炸彈，其餘各機亦依序向六七千噸的二，三，四，號船轟沉。確認其下沉的姿態後，始悠然復返歸途。指揮機雖然左翼有損，却似有神功，仍能漸向前進基地歸還。</p>
<p>完成任務</p>
<p>大羣海軍機，在完成任務後，向司令官所等候着的前進基地飛還，在日沒時候，到達〇〇基地，基地人員握手相迎，不過這次戰鬥中有幾個年輕而優秀的人機，尚未歸還。</p>
<p>轟炸機隊某某長〇〇中尉，在發見敵船之前，即已與襲來的格拉曼戰鬥機空戰，後座的偵察員被彈負傷，充滿着戰鬥意識的〇〇中尉，一面用傳聲管激勵負傷的偵察員一面與友機共同向敵船團急降下轟炸，在歸途中，突然從雲端上空降下二架格拉曼戰鬥機前來攻擊，燃料槽被擊中。</p>
<p>〇〇中尉機機尾拖著白色燃料的尾巴，努力向基地飛還，可是發動機最後也停止了。另一架戰鬥機在這帶傷的飛機的周圍迴旋着，多方激勵，現在亦已束手無策了。〇〇中尉不再能不時出現於敵人的海面上了。</p>
<p>這時候，機中的偵察員抬頭望見了友機，手中尚揮着軍艦旗，傳聲管中，二位轟炸隊員聲明了他們自炸的决意。於是〇〇中尉一瞬間即把操縱桿放手，大叫「天皇萬歲！」兩手高舉之後，再握住操縱桿，機首向下，在蘇羅門海面自炸，瞑目誌哀的友機中的戰友們，掙開眼睛看時，海面僅浮沉着飛散的機體碎片。早先不放在心上的豪雨，在這瞬間，傾盆而下。（翔：譯自四月三十日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>國民論壇　杜絕投機抑平物價之對策　組織保甲及同業合作守芻議　胡金元</p>
<p>事變以還，本市物價直綫上升，較諸民國二十六年，其增加率有高至數百倍者，一般則均在七八十倍左右。其間雖經當局一再設法抑止，然黑市猖獗，甚至變本加厲，終未能收其成效。其癥結不在當局執行之不嚴厲，實緣投機囤積者潛勢力之强盛，藐視法令，依然操縱，而一般市民自相驚擾之心理，亦有以助成之，如物價稍形回落，即爭先恐後，羣趨擠購，於是益堅囤虎奇貨可居之信心。本市握全國經濟之樞紐，影響所及，各地物價亦莫不隨之猛漲。目前對策，一方固賴賢明當軸盡力設法調整，一方則須市民體念當局意志，予以切實合作，始克有濟。茲就鄙見所及，申述如左：</p>
<p>保甲合作社之組織　本市保甲制度之確立，已使盜匪匿跡；保甲合作社之組織，則可根絕投機囤積。合作社之成效，無論爲生產運銷信用消費，均有取途捷徑，使生產奢與消費者得以直接連繫，以避免中間商之牟利剝削。故如能由當局倡導督促，就現有保甲基礎，以一甲或一保爲單位，組織某某租界某某區第某保消費合作社，先行舉辦消費業務，集資向各廠商請求配給或直接由產銷地訂購日用必需品，就後分配各社員，如是每一市民均爲合作社社員，均得享受平價產資之權利，而囤虎冉無從使其伎倆，在當局物資管理上亦可收事半功倍之效。保甲合作社曾經成立，乃推廣籌組區保甲合作社聯合會，而至上海市保甲合作社聯合會，俾使資力集中，互相連繫，共謀福利，而集體採購，依遞分配，更較簡易。其於民生經濟之貢獻，或亦稍有借助。</p>
<p>廠商同業合作社之組織</p>
<p>實業部最近促令各業公會之改組，調整內部機構，納入正軌，其意良善，鄙意如能進而利用其已有組織，由各公司行號分別組織運銷消費合作社，以同業公會爲合作社聯合會，最高組織則爲全市各業合作社聯合會，其業務如辦理原料及出品之採買與配給，各業利害相共，今加連絡，必能坦誠交換需要物資，上述保甲合作社冉當相輔進行，則非特各廠商行號之營業得以向正途發展，而一般小民受惠允深，囤虎或亦可因此而絕迹。</p>
<p>筆者才識兩缺，斗胆略貢愚見，此所以拋磚引玉，以冀杜絕投機囤積，抑平物價，以維民生，願賢明當局各界碩彥，共加研討，促其具體實施，小民幸甚！</p>
<p>迷路兒童經返還其家屬者凡卅五名，經招人納養者凡十一名，上月迷路兒童由各捕房發現者凡一〇〇名，其中五十四名經各捕房直接送還家屬。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「經濟必須交流」</h3>
<p>最近，財政部長周佛海先生和上海市長陳公博先生在華北接見新聞記者時，對於經濟交流與食糧問題的關係，都會有過中肯的言論。周部畏說：「華北是中央的華北，中央是華北的中央；國府對華北食糧問題，物資交流，交易基金的融通，必盡最大的力量，以謀救濟」。陳市長說：「無分南北，經濟必須交流：食糧不過是經濟的一部。」從周陳二氏的言論中，可以得到一個結論，就是當前最嚴重的食糧問題之解决，還當以經濟交流爲解決的基本原則；所謂經濟必須交流，不僅是指點食糧或其他物品的運輸移轉，同時還得致力於都市和農村資金的交流，方足以言救濟普遍的經濟恐慌。</p>
<p>最近，政府當局，在其努力解决糧食問題的辦法中，除於發行糧食庫劵以後，即已進行建築倉庫，購儲糧食而外，其最爲我們所矚目的，便是復興農村放款事宜。現在本市資力雄厚的銀行，於調查各地農村狀况及耕植情形完成以後，刻正進行聯合組織，辦理復興農村放款事宜。這樣一個措施，可謂切合「經濟交流」的原則，共自然的結果，便爲農村狀况的進步，糧食生產的增强。可是，貸款銀行所當千萬注意的一點，就是放款數字，不嫌龐大，而放款方向，必須認淸。最簡單的一句話，就是復興農村的放款，務求其深入田間，直達農民，勿令其爲任何一個居間機構所利用。因爲我們對於復興農村，期望太殷，所以我們對於農村貸款，言無不盡。</p>
<h3>實部公佈同業聯合會通則　指定十業聯合會籌備委員　限期五月底前一律組織完成</h3>
<p>實業部爲調整强化戰時經濟機構，結成一統制之組織，俾適應國府之戰時經濟政策，特於國府最高國防會議時，提議頒布工商業同業公會暫行條例，將舊有之同業公會重行改組之，對於主要商品公會，以縣市或特別市爲單位，分別設立具有法人性格之公會，以各公會代表者組織工商同業聯合會，爲全國商業統制總會專業部門之下層機構，以便調整民間蒐集配給機構之統制工作。以上工商同業公會聯合會之進打調整步驟，業經實業部組織同業公會整理委員會，迭經會議，決定之十六種主要商品工商同業聯合會分類及名稱，業已絡續發表，除棉製品業皂燭業火柴業烟葉業四聯合會籌備委員及籌備主任早經實業部指定，並已先後開發起人會成立外，茲父指定橡膠業等十業同業聯合會籌備委員曁籌備主任，限於本月底前一律組織成立，以充實全國商業統制總會之組織，同時實業部分別指派主管工商同業聯合會監理官，指導組織監督會務，此次實部公佈之工商同業公會暫行條例施行細則計三十一條，工商同業聯合會組織暫行通則計十五條，均極詳盡，茲將指定十業聯合會籌備委員及指派之監理官名單，分誌如下：</p>

<h3>最近財界人士對於「小工業貸款銀團」之意見</h3>
<p>在上海工業發展的現階段，手工業，小工業所占地位，相常重要，各銀行對於此種小工業之放款問題，自大東亞戰爭後，尤爲一般人所重視，最近當局極力確立金融機關之自　體制，澈底取締囤積，衆認實業部方面對於復興小工業，或將實施何種有效方法。</p>

<p>原則上不得超過其資金四分之三。（五）放款擔保：　限於機器，原料，製品等。（六）放款利息：原則上以低利貸放爲方針。（七）放款辦法：委員會隨時調查各工廠之生產狀况，對於虛僞申請，或將貸款使用於不正當用途者，酌量情形，予以處分，對於利用貸款後在小工業上獲得顯著成績者，予以高達當獎勵。其具體辦法，大體如上，值此小銀行濫設，租界體方案實爲改善金融活動，助成正當事業之良好方法。（五月四日大陸新報）麵粉公會訂定</p>

<h3>從寬容說起</h3>
<p>— 周驌</p>
<p>寬容是一種美德。但是，不看淸事實，不問靑紅皂白的寬容，却是惡行。</p>
<p>忍耐也是一種美德。但是，不論其應該與吾，而儘是一味的忍耐，却也是惡行。</p>
<p>例如，對於擾亂社會金融，妨害人民生活的投機囤積者之流，我們便母庸對之寬容和忍耐。「姑息養奷」，此言實有至理。</p>
<p>魯迅先生在他的短文「經騐」中有這幾句話：「沂來有些看報的人對於什麽宣言。通電。講演。談話之類，無論它怎樣駢四儷六，崇論宏議，也不去注意了，甚而還至於不但不注意，看了倒不過做做喀笑的資料……」這巳經是好幾年以前的話了，然而，現在的情形却還是如此，甚至而於比以前更壞。</p>
<p>買戲券時，大家爭先恐後的擁擠搶奪，而對於公益事情却袖手旁觀，澳不關心。其實是與各人有切身利害關係的事，不過，看起來却像一無關係似的。</p>
<p>世間最可悲可嘆可恥可憐的事，莫過於——</p>
<p>「把眞的當做假的，把假的當做眞的。</p>
<p>應該寬容忍耐的事，不寬容，不忍耐。而把不該寬容忍耐的事，寬容忍耐了。</p>
<p>把遊戲的事，當做正經事做。而把正經事看做了玩笑和遊戲。」</p>
<h3>上海雜記（一）</h3>
<p>— 橋本關雪</p>
<p>日本詩人仁科白谷歌曰：「鯤兮不屑復爲魚也，鵬兮不屑復爲雀也。唯憂六合之窄，豈足供鯤鵬之飛躍乎。」誰說莊子在那裏吹法螺。南至蘇羅門，東印度，北至阿留申羣島，都憯伏在我神鷹的雙翼下。鑽天入地，以前是當作摩訶不可思議的妖術，現在巳經成爲事實了。我剛從門司的海底潛行過來，現在却巳在天上了，在幾千公尺的蒼空飛行着。</p>
<p>跟着長友機長所指的方向看時，濟州島已經在望。山上尙有殘剩的皚皚白雪，從船上看起來，山峯似乎相當的高，可是在機中下望，恰似在脚底下滑過。從雲層中看見了混濁的海水，知道快近揚子江了。江口的崇明島，似晒網般舖在下面。崇明島的面積總算很廣的了，但一寸荒廢的土地也沒有，全部井然有序地耕種着，這實使人覺得可驚。</p>
<p>我在「南扯拾遺」中曾指出在那星棋羅布的舟山列島上，連山頂上都也種植着園藝，可見中國人的勤勉。聽由日本人指使的中國人，那祇是下層階級的惡的醜的方面，假使以爲全體中國人都是這樣，那未免隔着門縫兒瞧人，連人都變成扁的了。九江附近，每年有豪雨，一夜中可增高水位五十尺。誰都這樣想着，像揚子江口那樣的低地，不是要被大水吞沒嗎？</p>
<p>明知有這種情形，然而依然孜孜不倦地埋首耕種着，他們往往爲了田畔的一根草而相駡起來，他們的勤勉與忍耐，實在人們想像之外。就拿一只面盆來說，除了用作煮炊之外，洗濯亦用面盆，說句不中聽的話，甚至當作便器用。他們是這樣刻苦的國民。中國人實是値得詫異的國民，我們應該修正以前差誤的認識。在上海的某報道部長曾說過這樣的話：「中國中偉大的人很多，可惜沒有指揮的人。」其實在日本亦何獨不然。</p>
<p>不過正因爲沒有指揮的人，所以能在天威的統治下結成一團而勞働，這眞是國民的幸福。我們除修正對中國人的認識之外，更應該知道亞細亞眞正的和平，祇有與中華民國互相提携才能够成立，並應用互讓互尊的精神，一同前進。輕蔑中國人的概念，不能不加以清算。</p>
<p>我到上海來過幾决，自己也不大淸楚。然而此次所見到上海的面目，與前幾决完全不同了。日本租界小用說，外國租界也一般地淸潔了。隔了四年後重遊舊地的我，立即感到了一種非常的美。我把這感想說與當地人聽，他們也有同感。我所說的現在這面目的上海，不僅是外表上的美。爲了消滅所謂夾租界或法租界的區分，雖然還淸楚地在英法租界殘留着各　國的色彩，但束縛了數百年的桎梏到底已經擺脫了，大上海成爲整個的區域，我們對於這變遷，比甚麽都感到欣喜。而眼高於頂的英美人，在我黃種人之前高視闊步的姿態之消聲區跡，更感到痛快。</p>
<p>因事變而暫時散居的老朋友們，以後一個個重又回來了，有的並在南京政府扣任要職。我最不喜歡與人交往，所以可稱知己的人極少。一旦大家合得來，則彼此之友誼往往維持十年，二十年甚至於三十年而不堅。這些人們，一見我來到，輒相與握手言歡。</p>
<p>上海現有所謂文化協會者，其中多爲富豪官吏，頗喜歡舉行抹幾筆，民間的畫家無份。偶而畫成一張，便據爲瑰寳。極簡的一張，在他們巳是煞費心思了。</p>
<p>現在民間從事作畫的人小下百四五十名之多。著名的有符鐵年，錢瘦鐵，孫松，吉生等。每年九月九日是畫人節，其發起人除上述幾人外，另有夏敬觀，周鍊　，賀天健，王賢，孫雪泥等。在日本人問聽說收藏孫松所作的畫，這個人的畫，　倣吳昌碩而僅得其皮毛，受吳毒之甚者，旣沒有吳爲　學識，也沒有吳翁　氣魄。日本畫家不喜歡吳　碩畫的人很多，尤以靑年作家爲甚。這爲因吳翁自己也不以爲是一個畫家，篆刻是他的專門，中國人稱他是宋代以來第一人。這話或許是對的。篆刻興自漢代，不久即吿衰减，明末淸初，有丁鈍丁，何雪漁　出，始極一時之盛，近年可稱無人。吳昌碩的詩在近代中國人之間也以含蓄稱，不單以修辭勝。說得太遠了，言歸正傳。</p>
<p>吳昌碩，王一亭，兪語霜逝世後的今日，最近執上海盡壇之牛耳的是錢瘦鐵。這並不是有所偏愛。他在二十七年寄居我處頗久，數年前始歸上海。今年四十二歲，漸入成熟之境。他在古書畫上正在不斷地用功。（翔：譯自四月二十日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>適應與人生</h3>
<p>— 企洛</p>
<p>這是一個「適」者生存的世界。假使你不能「適應」，你就不能生存。所以日常爲生存而努力的生活稱「適應」。</p>
<p>日常生活中的一舉一動，都是「適應」的行爲。同樣一件事，會因各人性格的不同，而做出各種不同的「適應」行爲；因此而發生許多相異的結果。「適應」可使人獲得滿足。因爲人類的滿足是基於兩種方式獲得的，所以，「適應」亦可由兩方面解釋。</p>
<p>良好的「滴應」能使一個人生氣勃勃，愉快，努力上進；使他的生活，成爲有意義的「人生」，間接造成社會的淮步。反之，不良的「適應」，却使人死氣沉沉，頹唐，專心鑽營；祇有充滿着灰色的「人生」。就是他幸而能在社會上稱雄一時，久後亦必爲他人淘汰，成爲失敗毀滅的一份子，爲世人所不齒。</p>
<p>「適應」的行爲並不是先天賦有的，而是後天學得的。它極易因多决「適應」而造成習慣。所以，一旦不良的「適應」迭成了根深蒂固的習慣後，便不能輕而易舉地去糾正了。往往有許多極端不良的「適應」行爲，如：懦怯，怪癖，規避責任，延宕，怕懼，恐怖，憂鬱與煩惱等，都是從小養成的。年長後便成爲許多失敗的因子了。所以，我們必須趁早注意孩子們的舉動，培養成他們良好的「適應」行爲，將來不致身敗名裂。</p>
<p>良好「適應」行爲的先決條件，是當我們滿足個人的動機時，並不妨害他人。此外益以豐富的學識，深邃的修養，嚴正的情操等偉大的力量，才能產生出良好的「適應」行爲來。</p>
<p>所以，如果我們能够妥善地去「適應」，不怨天允人。那麽，「成功」之神正在向我們頻頻招手呢！</p>
<h3>孔園賞花</h3>
<p>— 子健</p>
<p>日困案牘，不如春遲，偶閱報載孔志淸氏有賣花濟貧之舉，頓生遊興，徒步往訪焉。</p>
<p>孔園位於善鐘路盡處，周繞以籬，其廣不一畝，中立一茅亭，乃主容休憩之所。旣入園，微聞淸香沁腦，胸懷一爽，仰首四顧，盆景參陳，凡盆栽花木，羅列無遺，且其景物，富蓄詩情，扶疏掩映，淸靜逸緻，近前俯視，春意盎然，松柏竹石，各呈秀態。如「靑雪護龍」，「章鞭降魔」等景，均頗可人意。偶有一二人物，點綴其問，允覺無限風光，耐人尋味。另有假山一方，高不盈尺，而峯巒巖壑，蔚然深秀，上棺三柏，蒼虬夭矯，飛舞迎人，尤爲園中特色，令人稱羨不置。後迎孔君於茅亭中，詢以盆栽之法，孔君笑而答曰：此道似簡易而實繁，非一時所能盡言者也。余爲慨然久之。旣而日將西逝，暮色瞑合，遂依依而歸。</p>
<h3>藝術觀的「人生」</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>「人生」應當要像彫刻，繪畫樣地一絲不苟的去造型，去刻劃，去煊染它用了「眞」「善」「美」的表現輿理想。</p>
<p>以「超功利的行爲所表現反自私情緒」的「人的作品」·都是「藝術」的結晶，這「作品」就是自身的行爲與思想。本來啊！美好的「人生」，就是人類可珍貴的藝術創造。</p>
<p>哲學上與藝術上都把「真」「善」「美」作人生的主要的「目的」與創作的根本法則綜合二者而言之，無非是自我人生創造的起點，生活的眞諦所在。</p>
<p>「眞」是「眞理」，眞理是埋在表面現象之下的東西，所以需要去發掘，而「眞理」又是隨着現實的事物在發展，所以又須在事物的各方面的關係及它的發展上去把握它。認識與追求眞理不是一件容易事，因爲吾人總難免要，「習慣的」，「常識的」，「主觀」的看法用所以又必須克服這些方始能求到眞理，因此一個人他能求得多少眞理使可決定他有多少成就。</p>
<p>「美」的方始是「眞一的，不眞便不「美」，所以美與眞是有着密切關係，吾人「理想」中的人生便是「美」的人生，愛美是人類崇高的天性，心靈的「美」是一切事業的起點，能不損自己道德與人格的「美」，是人生最重要的工作之一。</p>
<p>「善」是人格上的負責行爲，「至善」即「至美」，「善」的行爲即「眞」的動力，人的一生無非是要獲得「善」的充實，要獲得它必須由自我修養爲起點。</p>
<p>總而言之，「藝術觀的人生」是「人生，的眞諦，是唯一的，超然的，「藝術」不能脫離「人生」，「人生」更不能脫離「藝術」，「人生」的價値與目　，根本就基於追求「眞」，「善」，「美」的崇高的境界。</p>
<h3>命運</h3>
<p>— 小窗</p>
<p>各種事物的發展，必然有一定的內部根據，可是它偶然的發現形式，就是說，一件事物發展過程中，內部有各種條件根據的原因，而產生這樣的：可是發現的形式即是不一定「偶然的」，這小一定的形式，又是一定「必然的」而產生，所以一切事物產生或變化肯仔細的硏究內部發展的情形，就不會覺得這是特然了，這是不破　定理。</p>
<p>可是有許多人們都不去研究這些，一切的事物成功，失敗都以爲「命運」的原因，成功的，固然歸納在這裏，失敗的也歸納在這裏，連平常生活正常的過着，稱謂是「命運」如此，是不能補救的了。</p>
<p>有的他不感到自己的不努，不上進，他感到的，是自己「命運」不好，有的他很努力，很上進，他不明這社會的現狀，他不去求這些了解，在他生活不滿足時，就說是自己「命運」不好，有的，他不明白自已優處和缺點，得意的時候，以爲自己一命運」好，不去利用自已的優處，和怎樣减少缺點，失敗的時候，就不可收拾，說自己「命運」開始不好了，也不去了解失敗的原因？所謂「富貴由命，生死在天」的一句話，就　有根據的事物，迷信到這是神的力量，「命運」的擺佈，使走上這一條路上去，不知害了多少的人？，不知有多少有希望有前途的斷送在這「命運」二字手裏？也不知誰作惡而欺騙了這許多的人而這樣長的期間？</p>

<h3>A Message for Youth Day</h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government ordered that May 5th of each year be designated as "Youth Day." At a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly severe and East Asian nations are jointly fighting against Britain and the United States, this decision by the authorities is of great significance. It fully demonstrates the importance the authorities place on the role of youth in the new era and the earnest expectations they hold for them. From the perspective of the current world situation, in order to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and to build a new order in East Asia and even the world, it is imperative to have the enthusiastic participation of young people. From the standpoint of the nation, not only is it necessary to mobilize the total strength of the nation's youth for the current actual war, but also to start planning the training of youth as soon as possible for the future construction of a new China. All of this mainly requires the self-awareness and spontaneous struggle of the nation's youth. The government's designation of "Youth Day" should be the first call to awaken the nation's youth to rise up.</p>
<p>Chinese youth have a glorious history of struggle. No one can underestimate the decisive power of Chinese youth in the fate of the nation. However, it must be admitted that in the past, a few ambitious individuals exploited the passion, innocence, frankness, and bravery of young people to build positions and make sacrifices for their own benefit. At the same time, attention and support were not given to the youth groups themselves, the progress of the youth themselves, and the proper position of youth in the nation, and were even destroyed and suppressed. Countless promising young people have been innocently ruined and sacrificed, greatly damaging the vitality of the nation. We have learned from our pain and, on this first Youth Day, we respectfully plead on behalf of the nation's youth, hoping that the authorities and society as a whole will cherish young people, give them the ability to unite, seek progress, and contribute to the nation and society.</p>
<p>What we hope from the nation's youth is that, in view of the current severe situation and the nation's serious position, they will recognize the decisive power of youth in the future destiny of the nation, that everyone will no longer abandon themselves, that everyone will from now on respect and cherish themselves, and that everyone will be prepared to be masters of the country and pioneers in transforming society and building a new China. Secondly, we will no longer allow young people to be ignorant of current affairs, and thus be romantic and decadent, or to study to death. We can no longer be passively pessimistic, but must be truly invigorated, concerned about national affairs, and take responsibility for our motherland. Furthermore, we hope that everyone will recognize the urgent needs of East Asia and our country, work doubly hard, study science and technology, launch scientific movements, promote technical learning, forge themselves into a steel-like team, truly be pioneers in transforming society, be cadres for building a new China, and complete the great cause of a new order in Greater East Asia and even the world!</p>
<h3>As Long-Lived as the Nation</h3>
<p>The Chairman, endowed with innate talent and courage, has followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in devoting himself to the revolutionary cause for decades. The number of dangers and twists he has experienced during that time is enough to be recorded in history books and praised. We will not mention that for the time being. Let us close our eyes and imagine that if the Sino-Japanese Incident had continued to this day without the Chairman's express telegram expressing his advocacy for peace negotiations, then the recent new China policy of our friendly nation Japan would not have come about. We further speculate that the Chairman's determination to launch peace negotiations was simply with the courage of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" and thus had this heroic act. Therefore, in addition to wishing the Chairman to be as long-lived as the nation from the bottom of our hearts, we express our first point of admiration.</p>
<p>In our country, it is customary to celebrate the sixtieth birthday. While social customs generally dictate that those with a little wealth, even in their thirties or forties, often hold lavish birthday celebrations to show off their extravagance, the Chairman, at the age of sixty-one, has a brilliant career and his birthday celebrations are not intended to be ostentatious. From the beginning, he has refused them and has spoken out about the importance of practicing frugality and correcting customs. We feel that frugality is indeed something that all citizens should earnestly practice at this time. The result of frugality can reduce the consumption of materials and at the same time passively increase the use of materials. Therefore, the two words "frugality," at first glance, seem to be a minor matter of "being a good housekeeper" that is not of great significance; in fact, all major issues related to national welfare and people's livelihood, such as politics, economy, and even social culture, have a significant relationship with this. Especially when we are at war with foreign countries, when materials are scarce, prices are high, and people's lives are difficult, we must earnestly practice frugality in order to increase the materials needed for the war, stabilize high prices, and alleviate the difficulties of life. However, what we want to loudly appeal for is that the general public, who are suffering from difficult living conditions, have already practiced frugality to the point where they can no longer cut back. Only the middle and upper classes must practice frugality across the board. At the same time, we hope that they will use the surplus from their savings to provide for the general public who are suffering from difficult living conditions. We say this because we have seen too much of the phenomenon in Shanghai society where "the rich stink of meat and wine, while the roads are littered with frozen corpses." We believe that the Chairman's special emphasis on frugality is also for this reason. This is our second point of admiration.</p>
<p>We know that the Chairman is busy with official duties, managing myriad affairs every day, and yet he gets up as early as six o'clock and does not sleep until eleven o'clock at night, and is still full of energy. Therefore, it can be further proven that the more diligent you are, the healthier you will be. Looking back at some people in the officialdom, even late at night, they are still chasing after the bright lights and drunken revelry, and their spirits are "vigorous." By the next day, the sun is already high in the sky, and they are still sleeping soundly, not keeping office hours. Even when they do arrive, they are listless. Compared to the Chairman, how can they not feel ashamed! To go a step further, even if the leaders are working hard for the country day and night, it is still difficult for a single tree to support a tall building. Only if all civil servants, especially senior and middle-level cadres, take the Chairman's spirit of handling affairs as a model and work together can politics be improved and the country be revived. This is our third point of admiration.</p>
<p>We should understand the Chairman's great intention in refusing birthday celebrations, and we should also appreciate the true meaning of practicing frugality and correcting customs. We silently celebrate in our hearts the Chairman being as long-lived as the nation, to serve our people forever. Yesterday was the Chairman's birthday. We admired the Chairman's intention and did not say a word of celebration to avoid impropriety. However, we hope to express our inner admiration today, after the fact, and to further explain the meaning of practicing frugality, so as to celebrate with the people of the country the Chairman being as long-lived as the nation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Launches Daylight Air Raid on Darwin Port, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Allied Air Force; Airfields in Bengal, India, Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency) – On the 2nd, the Japanese Naval Air Force launched a large-scale daylight air raid on Darwin Port, inflicting heavy damage on the Allied Air Force in aerial combat. The Australian government and public were shocked, and military experts were amazed at the excellence of the Japanese Naval Air Force. According to reports from Melbourne, the Allied Command issued a statement on the night of the 2nd, stating that on the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force engaged in aerial combat with the Allied Air Force in the Darwin Port area and over the Arafura Sea to the north, and the Allied Air Force suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, a special correspondent from the Allied Command stated regarding the air battle: On the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force heavily bombed Allied airfields near Darwin Port, and the Allied Air Force suffered heavy losses in the aerial combat. Although Spitfire aircraft piloted by British and Australian personnel engaged the Japanese aircraft, the damage suffered was significant. This is the first time the Allied Command has issued a statement acknowledging significant damage in the air war in the Southwest Pacific. A special correspondent from the British Central Broadcasting Station in Melbourne also stated: The Allied forces have not suffered such heavy losses in the past. However, if the Spitfire aircraft were indeed piloted by British and Australian pilots who had engaged the German Air Force on the European front, then the cause of the defeat is even more incomprehensible. In the past, due to the urgency of the African front, it was not possible to import Spitfire aircraft, but the most recently arrived ones are the latest models. Therefore, this defeat was truly unexpected. The pilots and aircraft of the Japanese Air Force must be the best. The Australian radio station also broadcast that the Spitfire is the best fighter aircraft in the world, but in this air battle, against Japanese aircraft, it suffered heavy losses. The Spitfire aircraft is superior to other types of aircraft in high-altitude flight, and the pilots are all British and Australian pilots who recently transferred to Australia with the aircraft. Therefore, this crushing defeat is truly incomprehensible. Macarthur is known for fabricating facts. It is rumored that in order to point out the crisis in the Pacific, he may abandon his past deceptive policies and have no choice but to acknowledge this crushing defeat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a communique issued yesterday in New Delhi, an airfield in southeastern Bengal Province was bombed by aircraft, resulting in slight casualties and damage, and one British aircraft is missing.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency) – The large-scale bombing of Darwin Port by the Japanese Air Force and the activity of Japanese submarines in the South Pacific seem to have given Australia a great shock. According to reports from Melbourne, Australian Army Minister Ford issued a statement on the 22nd, appealing to Britain and the United States for assistance, the gist of which was that we request that Britain and the United States send large quantities of ships, aircraft, and troops to the South Pacific front. Recently, the Japanese military has increased submarine strength in the South Pacific. Japan intends to cut off Australia's communication lines. The number of our transport ships lost due to attacks by Japanese submarines is increasing daily. Judging from the activity of Japanese submarines and the bombing of Darwin Port by the Japanese Air Force, it is clear that Japan has now launched an offensive.</p>

<h3>Explanation of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Essential Commodities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— The Supreme National Defense Council unanimously passed the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Commodities at its meeting on the morning of the 3rd. The regulations, consisting of twelve articles, have been published in full. The aim of Articles 1 and 2 is to protect the legitimate business practices of members of trade associations for essential commodities and small vendors with capital less than one thousand yuan. Penalties are clearly stipulated for those who violate these regulations, namely, “Non-members of trade associations for essential commodities who hoard essential commodities for profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than seven years, and may also be subject to a fine of not more than 50,000 yuan.” Article 2 further stipulates that the trading partners of members of trade associations should be genuine direct consumers. However, this restriction does not apply to agricultural producers selling their own agricultural products or to those who are legally qualified as brokers or agents, which is a matter of course. Article 3 stipulates the obligations of members of trade associations to the competent authorities and the trade associations themselves, with legal penalties attached for those who conceal or fail to register. Article 4 provides for ancillary penalties for those who violate Articles 2 and 3; individuals shall be subject to criminal penalties, and goods shall be confiscated. Article 5 stipulates that those who use money as a means to induce others to commit crimes shall also be considered accomplices under the regulations. Article 6 stipulates severe criminal penalties for those who disrupt the market due to violations of Articles 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the provisions include the death penalty or life imprisonment, as well as a fine of not more than 100,000 yuan. Article 7 is solely aimed at punishing civil servants who commit crimes. Even if they are state officials, their punishment will not be lenient, reflecting the legislative intent to rectify discipline. Articles 8 and 9 provide a path to self-renewal for past hoarders. Article 10 further clarifies that the provisions of Article 8 and 9, paragraph 1, do not apply to civil servants, demonstrating the government's determination to deal with civil servant crimes more severely than those of ordinary people. Article 11 defines the qualifications for membership in trade associations. Overall, the entire regulation contains the following meanings: (1) to establish a legal basis for a wartime economic system and effectively implement wartime economic policies, (2) to protect the legitimate business practices of members of trade associations for essential commodities and small vendors, (3) to clarify that the purpose of profit-making should be legal and public in nature, (4) to impose the most severe penalties on offenders, including civil servants, (5) to provide a legal path to self-renewal for past hoarders, while taking strict measures against civil servants, (6) to rectify discipline and implement clean governance, (7) after the implementation of these regulations, the government is determined to enforce them. In the future, hoarders will be severely sanctioned, and the stability of people's livelihoods and the stabilization of prices will be positively influenced by this law. The people should act together, supervise each other, strive to report crimes, and jointly complete the wartime system to revive China.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Li of the Clearance Committee Returns to Nanjing from Guangdong to Report</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Governor Isogai Discusses Hong Kong Dollar, Permitting Temporary Circulation</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, April 3rd, Central News Agency Telegram— Hong Kong Governor Isogai met with a group of Chinese reporters on the 3rd and answered various questions about the current situation in Hong Kong, explaining the reasons for allowing the circulation of Hong Kong dollars from the British administration. The main points of his conversation are as follows: The lives of ordinary citizens in Hong Kong are becoming more stable. The restrictions on the exchange of Hong Kong dollars and military scrip have caused inconvenience to transactions and the lives of citizens. Now that the military scrip reserves are sufficient, these exchange restrictions have been lifted. The depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar is a natural trend. Originally, the life of the Hong Kong dollar should have ended long ago. It is inherently unreasonable to allow the circulation of Hong Kong dollars from the British administration in Hong Kong, but in consideration of the lives of ordinary citizens, it is permitted to circulate temporarily.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Shoots at Innocent People in Vietnam</h3>

<h3>The Meaning of May Fourth Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>The National Government's designation of May 5th each year as Youth Day is significant. April 4th is Children's Day, and June 6th is Teachers' Day. Youth Day falls appropriately between these two festivals. Moreover, at this time, new greenery abounds, and the mountains and rivers are covered in a vibrant, fresh, and lively atmosphere, which is most fitting as a symbol of youth.</p>
<p>Historically, January 1st of the first year of the Republic was the anniversary of the Founding Father's inauguration as Provisional President in Nanjing, and May 5th of the tenth year was the anniversary of the Founding Father's inauguration as President in Guangzhou. The former is related to the creation of the Republic of China, and the latter is related to the revival of the Republic of China. Looking back at that time, the country was divided by warlords, and darkness prevailed. Even in Guangzhou, counter-revolutionary forces were brewing and about to erupt. The Founding Father, unwilling to see the interruption of the National Revolution, took on the heavy responsibility of reviving the Republic of China in an extremely adverse environment. This spirit of knowing only righteousness and understanding the truth, regardless of success or failure, is truly the highest model of youth. At that time, some people argued that the National Assembly did not have a quorum. It should be known that since the military governors' rebellion in the sixth year, which violated the law and dissolved the National Assembly, the fundamental spirit of the "Protection of the Constitution" lay in overthrowing the military governors. Since the object of protection, the military governors, had to be overthrown, there could be no principal body to protect, the government of the Republic of China. The importance of this fundamental spirit was a hundred times greater than that of form. Unfortunately, many people at that time were mired in form and neglected the fundamental spirit, so that in the eleventh year, they were used by the military governors to restore the National Assembly in Beijing. In the twelfth year, this restored National Assembly supported the leader of the military governors, Cao Kun, with each member receiving tens of thousands of yuan or even thousands of yuan per vote to elect Cao Kun as President. From then on, the National Assembly fell into a hellish abyss. This was because the fundamental spirit had disappeared. With only the shell remaining, it naturally decayed. Many people regretted it, but it was already too late. From this, it can be seen that the progress of history depends entirely on the fundamental spirit. Form can change, but the fundamental spirit cannot. When we celebrate Youth Day, remembering the date of Youth Day, which is also the date on which the Founding Father took on the heavy responsibility of reviving the Republic of China, we should persevere.</p>
<p>Speaking of even older history, the fifth day of the fifth lunar month is the Dragon Boat Festival. According to legend, Qu Yuan of the Warring States period drowned himself in the Miluo River on this day. Qu Yuan's biography appears in the Records of the Grand Historian, and his words appear in the Lament. Originally, suicide is a passive act and not worthy of emulation, but when we read the Records of the Grand Historian and the Lament, we can understand Qu Yuan's intentions. Gu Tinglin's Daily Knowledge Records has two passages that are the best. Since I don't have the Daily Knowledge Records at hand, I will record them roughly as follows: When reading Qu Yuan's Lament, one realizes that Yao's actions stemmed from his integrity. Those who conform to the common customs and blend in with the corrupt world cannot be admitted to the Way of Yao and Shun.</p>
<p>The teachings of Lao Tzu differ from those of Confucius in that they harmonize with their light and share their dust. This is what is called seemingly right but actually wrong. The fisherman of Bu Ju exhaustively understood this. It is not that he did not know that his words could be followed, but there were righteous things that should not be done. If Ziyun knew this righteousness, would he not have written the Lament? In seeking its main point, one is born into this world and lives for this world. It is good to be good. This is why he is called the Grand Master of Mang.</p>
<p>The main idea of the above two passages is that a person must be firm in his faith and clear in his understanding, and not be overcome by the environment. Like Qu Yuan, who would rather die than be overcome by the common customs and the corrupt world, he is worthy of admiration. If he had not died by suicide but had died in revolution, that would have been complete. However, even this spirit of preferring death to surrender is rare. In general, young people must be firm in their faith and steadfast in their integrity. Only in this way can they establish themselves and transform society. Qu Yuan was able to hate the vulgar and be overcome by it, which is worthy of admiration, but we must go further, fighting against the vulgar, overcoming the vulgar, and transforming a bright and pure society.</p>
<p>From the previous Dragon Boat Festival, there is a way to commemorate Qu Yuan, which is dragon boat racing. Dragon boats are ancient tools, but the spirit of racing is the same now as it was then. Dozens of people work together on a boat, striving to move forward and compete with other boats. This kind of competition is mutually encouraging and promotes progress. This spirit of competition is very important in the sense of historical progress and in the sense of social evolution.</p>
<p>The above are just a few words attached to the present Youth Day, prompted by the previous Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>In short, young people, in this era, should recognize the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia, and take on everything with a spirit of diligence, endurance, courage, and progress. When celebrating Youth Day, remembering the difficult struggle and perseverance of the Founding Father when he took office as President on May 5th of the tenth year, we strengthen our sense of responsibility to carry on the past and usher in the future, and vow to continue our efforts to carry out the unfinished will of the Founding Father's life. At the same time, recalling a beautiful history of ancient times, which is both worth singing and worth weeping, we should be stirred by the wind of inspiration a hundred generations later, and we should muster a vibrant, fresh, and lively spirit and move forward with big strides.</p>

<h3>London and Washington Believe the Soviet-Polish Problem Remains Very Serious, Moscow Advocates Complete Reorganization of the Polish Government, Stanczyk Demands the Soviets Release Poles</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to the latest news obtained by Stefani News Agency, London and Washington still consider the situation after the severance of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland to be serious. The attitude of British and American newspapers seems to be dissatisfied with both the Soviet Union and Poland. A recent Gallup poll in the United States asked, "Do you believe that the Soviet Union will cooperate loyally after the war?" Fifty percent of the answers were no. This has greatly displeased Moscow.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Soviet News Agency stated last night that it advocated a complete reorganization of the Sikorski government, while condemning General Sikorski for colluding with reactionary elements among Polish exiles and making anti-Soviet concessions in the United States. The agency continued that Poland now needs a new government whose members have a deep understanding of wartime needs, can fully shoulder the responsibility for the Poles and the anti-Axis countries, and will not become a tool for the enemy, but will seek a friendly union with the Soviet Union. The agency concluded that a prerequisite for the formation of a new government is the rejection of the policy of occupying Ukraine, as Moscow deeply hopes that the new government can resolve border issues in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>Ankara, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to reports from Tehran: Stanczyk, Minister of Social Welfare of the Polish government-in-exile, has requested the Soviet government to release more than 800,000 Poles it has detained. He stated that only by releasing these Poles can the current and future misunderstandings between the Soviet and Polish governments be dispelled. Stanczyk recalled that after the Polish government refused to recognize Jews and Ukrainians as Soviet citizens, the Soviet government issued an order on January 16, 1943, depriving Poles under Soviet jurisdiction of their Polish citizenship. He stated, "If the citizenship issue can be resolved immediately, we are prepared to leave all land issues to the peace conference to resolve."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to a London special dispatch carried by Swedish newspapers on the 4th, US President Roosevelt sent a personal telegram to Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, urging him to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute.

<h3>Former Bulgarian Police Chief Pantiev Assassinated</h3>
<p>Sofia, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Former Bulgarian Police Chief Colonel Pantiev was shot and killed yesterday at 1:25 PM. The assassins were a man and a woman. Authorities believe the case has political motives. The details of the case are as follows: The assassins first lay in ambush under the stairs of Pantiev's residence. When he went out, they fired two shots in a row, both hitting his head. He died within minutes. Two people witnessed the incident and chased the assassins, but failed to capture them. The police quickly arrived and immediately began investigating. Pantiev was a well-known military judge, 50 years old. He served as Bulgaria's Police Chief from February 1929 to November 1941. He was then appointed as a judge of the Military Court of Appeals, but declined and instead practiced law. It is believed that the assassins in this case belong to the same terrorist group that assassinated former Army Chief General Koev in February and Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Yaniv on April 15. Pantiev was well known for his fight against [communists] when he was Police Chief.</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Forces Complete Deployment, Preparing for Summer Battle, German-Romanian Allied Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack on the Kuban River</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Moscow sources report that a major offensive may soon be launched on the Eastern Front, while Berlin sources say that the large-scale attacks made by the Soviet army on the eastern flank of the Axis bridgehead in the Kuban region weakened on Sunday. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army lost several divisions and companies and many tanks in the past few days south of the Kuban River. They then sent several battalions to fight, but the German-Romanian Allied Forces, in cooperation with the powerful German Air Force, launched a fierce counterattack. After a fierce battle, they surrounded the attacking Soviet forces. Except for a few who were captured, the rest were annihilated. It is said that some Soviet troops did not resist and surrendered. Berlin has not made any predictions about the fighting in the area. German military experts only pointed out that the Soviet army is continuing to make fierce attacks, but it is not yet possible to say whether the battle has reached its climax. At the same time, the United Press correspondent in Moscow said: The German and Soviet forces have clearly completed their redeployment along the front line to prepare for this summer's battle. Large-scale battles have also occurred several times in northwestern Caucasus.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to news from the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive on the Kuban River has weakened, while the German counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce. Especially in the Novorossiysk area, the German army is continuing to attack and launch an annihilation battle. According to the German News Agency, it is said that the Soviet army lost 16 tanks and 21 aircraft on the 2nd, which shows the low combat power of the Soviet army. According to the United Press Moscow telegram, the German and Soviet forces have now completed the reorganization of the entire line, and are preparing to launch a fierce offensive with artillery fire. It is said that skirmishes have begun between the two armies in the Voronezh region.</p>
<p>Moscow, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— After increasing pressure on the German bridgehead, the Red Army is currently engaged in a bloody battle with the German-Romanian mixed army. According to front-line reports, the German counterattack has apparently failed. The Soviet communiqué did not mention the Kuban battle, only saying that fighting continues around Borokria, the Soviet bridgehead 50 miles southeast of Kharkov. In other locations, Soviet artillery and reconnaissance aircraft are probing German positions in preparation for the final battle. It is generally believed that the future German offensive will strike a major blow to the Soviet capital, with Orel being the center of the entire line, as the Germans are confident in their fierce tanks. Military commentator Lieutenant Colonel Vasilyev said, "The upcoming battle will be extremely difficult."</p>

<h3>American Coal Miners Temporarily Return to Work for Half a Month</h3>
<p>Lisbon, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to reports from Washington, yesterday was the first day of the American miners' return to work. The situation was not very enthusiastic, as only half of the miners actually resumed work, and the rest are expected to return to work today. Officials from the United Mine Workers of America announced on Sunday evening, before President Roosevelt's radio broadcast, that bituminous coal miners would temporarily return to work for fifteen days pending negotiations for increased wages. Interior Secretary Ickes announced yesterday the formation of a five-member committee to oversee the operation of anthracite mines, whose contracts with the 8,000 anthracite miners who had joined the strike expired at midnight on April 30. Reports from Washington suggest that officials have not publicly discussed the matter of this strike, but general opinion seems to hold that, with one possible exception, any agreement to resolve the coal industry dispute will be submitted to the War Labor Board for approval. This exception will be that the sixth day of the week will receive extra wages. At the same time, according to War Labor Board officials, the three-person subcommittee appointed by the board will resume its work as soon as coal production returns to normal, gathering facts and making recommendations. United Mine Workers President Lewis, after agreeing with Interior Secretary Ickes on Sunday morning, issued an order to the miners that evening to return to work for fifteen days. He promised the miners that he would make every effort to use this two-week period to devise a new wage method. Labor Secretary Perkins criticized this fifteen-day return-to-work agreement, saying that it did not mean that the government had accepted the strike demands.</p>
<h3>British Labor Minister Announces Conscription of Workers Act</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) – Labor Minister Mr. Bevin announced stringent regulations for the conscription of workers. The announcement stated that, starting May 8th, the government has the power to conscript men up to the age of 50 to perform jobs previously held by younger individuals, allowing the latter to enlist in military service. The order also includes women over the age of 45, who should serve in essential wartime industries for all or part of their time, except those with young children. Currently, there are 500,000 married women working part-time in wartime industries. The remaining manpower lies with married women, hence their inclusion in the order.</p>
<h3>Tunisian Front – Only Localized Battles – Anti-Axis Powers Concentrating Transport Ships – Rumored to be Planning Large-Scale Landing Operation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency: Only localized battles occurred on the Tunisian front on Sunday. The fighting has been relatively calm since the major battles of Easter. The reason for this is that the Anti-Axis forces, especially the British First Army, have indeed suffered significant losses. However, the enemy possesses superior manpower and material resources and should be able to replenish these losses simultaneously. The Anti-Axis forces' preparations near the front are not sufficient to offset these losses, but the Anti-Axis powers have significant preparations in Algeria and Morocco, enough to form more than one army. This is an open secret. North African railway transportation is excellent, and the Anti-Axis powers can dispatch sufficient new troops to replace their heavily damaged units, but the Anti-Axis side does not seem to have done so. Based on repeated reports of a large concentration of Anti-Axis transport ships in Algerian ports, there may be another explanation. The Anti-Axis high command, not yet using most of its preparations for North African operations, may be planning a large-scale landing operation. The Anti-Axis forces may be planning to land on the Tunisian coast, as they know that a direct attack on Axis positions is extremely difficult and would inevitably result in heavy losses. However, the Anti-Axis forces may also be planning to land on the coasts of Sicily or Sardinia, which is also possible.</p>
<h3>Full Picture of Naval Battle off Florida Island</h3>
<p>(From Takeda, Special Correspondent at South Pacific 〇〇 Base (Naval Reporting Team))</p>
<p>The mission of the naval battle off Florida Island on April 7th was to "attack enemy fleets (mainly transport convoys) around Guadalcanal Island and crush the enemy's counter-offensive attempts." The results achieved include sinking or damaging 15 enemy ships and shooting down approximately 40 enemy aircraft. In this extraordinary operation by the naval air force, the enemy suffered a significant blow. This was a preemptive aerial surprise attack. Although the weather was unfavorable at the time of the attack, the aggressive spirit of our naval air force completely overcame this adverse natural environment, resolutely flew over Guadalcanal Island, and successfully destroyed the enemy's supply convoy. The enemy's elite Grumman fighters were shot down one by one. Therefore, this battle took very little time. The 〇〇 Commander and the reporting team at 〇〇 base personally experienced the fierce aerial combat during this operation.</p>
<p>Departure</p>
<p>At 〇〇 o'clock in the morning on the 7th, the area around the 〇〇 base was like the eve of a storm, with extremely bad weather. In this dark plain, there were dots of fireflies, which were the lights of the maintenance crew, who were preparing the machinery all night before the sortie. The fireflies disappeared into the darkness, and only the roaring engine test sounds broke the deep sleep. The sky gradually turned fish-white, and darkness bowed before the light. The planes broke through the dim sky and took off. When the lead plane carrying the commander rose to a height of 〇〇 meters, many planes were already lined up waiting, and together they quickly flew forward into the gradually brightening dawn sky.</p>
<p>Above the sea, patches of broken clouds floated, and the flight was very smooth. Flying 〇〇 kilometers in one breath, the leader plane we were on separated from the attack squadron and landed at a certain forward base. At this time, the Solomon Islands, overgrown with coconut groves, were full of vitality, and the morning dew wetted the landing planes. Only 〇〇 kilometers from the enemy's front-line base, "Guadalcanal," where the enemy and we have been stalemated for half a year, repeatedly engaging in bloody battles. But on this clear morning, there was no sign of killing intent.</p>
<p>Attack</p>
<p>Soon, the silence of this morning was broken. Suddenly, a metallic buzzing sound was heard overhead. The enemy's Lockheed reconnaissance plane flew at an invisible altitude. Did they know we were going to attack? We couldn't wait another hour. A large combined attack squadron of fighter-bombers immediately ascended to the skies above Guadalcanal. The reporting team prayed for the success of the combat units under the coconut leaves, while the commander, standing on a not-very-high hill, stared at the southeast sky where the planes had flown past, his heart filled with the conviction of victory. The commander knew this was a difficult attack. In broad daylight, the brave men of our naval aircraft had to rush into the modern fortifications built by the enemy with all their might, where hundreds of enemy fighters were waiting, and the enemy had deployed a heavy barrage of anti-aircraft guns. What a daunting task!</p>
<p>One squadron of the attack force, first departing from the sea south of Guadalcanal, advanced towards the enemy's ship concentration point on the north shore amidst dense layers of clouds. However, the sky over the island was covered with chaotic clouds over 10,000 meters, which were extremely dense. If they tried to descend through the clouds, the formation would inevitably be disrupted, which was the worst possible tactic. So they changed course and detoured west of the island. When they reached the western end, the enemy had already been alerted by the sudden attack of our air force, and dozens of Grumman fighters and intense ground fire responded simultaneously.</p>
<p>Patrolling right over the western end of Guadalcanal, the order for a general surprise attack came down. At this moment, four Grumman fighters suddenly attacked our fighter unit from above the clouds. 〇〇 Captain was preparing an attack posture to meet them head-on, when two enemy planes stealthily descended from above with a bang. Lieutenant 〇〇, who had fought many battles since the China Incident, immediately shot down one of them, clearing the way for the bombers while attacking the enemy airfield along the coast. At that time, four more Grumman planes attacked our bombers. 〇 Squadron received the order to "attack" and charged first, instantly shooting down three of them, leaving one to escape, forming ranks and advancing again. Ahead, five more enemy planes attacked a small squadron of our comrades. This squadron of enemy planes put up a stubborn resistance, only shooting down two, leaving the rest to the follow-up units, while the main force covered the bombers as they penetrated further east into enemy airspace.</p>
<p>When the bomber squadron detoured from the west to the north shore, it was attacked by enemy fighters, and the ground fire was also extremely intense, so the planes in this squadron were hit by several enemy bullets, but they still didn't care and advanced eastward. Near the enemy airfield, they saw several enemy transport convoys moving left and right from the clouds. The squadron split into two. One squadron broke into this convoy, suddenly attacking the convoy seen in the clouds. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire blindly shot without aim. Amid the deafening explosions, they quickly descended, dropping accurate bombs, and rotated. The enemy destroyers surrounding the convoy, opening anti-aircraft fire, were also hit, emitting black smoke, and gradually sank.</p>
<p>The other bomber squadron moved further eastward, searching for the enemy. From this point on, the enemy fighter attacks became even more intense. Enemy fire was everywhere, front, back, above, and below. Amid this hail of enemy bullets, they remotely discovered six transport ships guarded by cruisers and destroyers, with long white wakes trailing behind, obviously trying to evade our aircraft's attack, while the ships' cannons continued to fire at our planes.</p>
<p>The bomber squadron leisurely detoured from right to left. Led by 〇 Squadron Leader's plane, they broke into the convoy. The fire concentrated on the command plane was extremely intense, and the sky suddenly turned into a sea of fire. The lead command plane's left wing was finally pierced by a bullet and caught fire, but it still disregarded everything and dropped a bomb on a 10,000-ton transport ship. The remaining planes also sequentially bombed the number two, three, and four ships, each between 6,000 and 7,000 tons. After confirming their sinking posture, they leisurely returned to base. Although the command plane's left wing was damaged, it seemed to have divine power, and it was still able to gradually advance back to base.</p>
<p>Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>After completing their mission, a large group of naval aircraft flew back to the forward base where the commander was waiting. They arrived at the 〇〇 base at sunset. The base personnel greeted them with handshakes. However, several young and excellent men and machines had not yet returned from this battle.</p>
<p>〇〇 Lieutenant, commander of a bomber squadron, had already engaged in aerial combat with the attacking Grumman fighters before discovering the enemy ships. The observer in the back seat was wounded by a bullet. 〇〇 Lieutenant, filled with fighting spirit, encouraged the wounded observer through the speaking tube, and together with friendly aircraft, rapidly descended to bomb the enemy convoy. On the way back, two Grumman fighters suddenly descended from the clouds to attack, and the fuel tank was hit.</p>
<p>〇〇 Lieutenant's plane, with a white trail of fuel streaming from its tail, struggled to fly back to base, but the engine eventually stopped. Another fighter circled around the damaged plane, encouraging it in every way, but now there was nothing more that could be done. 〇〇 Lieutenant would no longer be able to appear above the enemy's sea.</p>
<p>At this moment, the observer in the plane looked up and saw friendly aircraft, waving the naval flag in his hand. In the speaking tube, the two bomber crew members declared their intention to self-destruct. Then, in an instant, 〇〇 Lieutenant released the control stick, shouted "Long live the Emperor!" raised both hands high, then gripped the control stick again, pointed the nose of the plane downward, and self-destructed in the Solomon Sea. When his comrades in the friendly aircraft, who were mourning with their eyes closed, opened their eyes, only scattered pieces of the aircraft's wreckage were floating on the sea. The heavy rain that had previously been ignored poured down at this moment. (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 30th)</p>

Subsequently, sugar and hemp from the Philippines, rubber from Malaya, cotton from China, and machinery from Japan will be mutually exchanged due to the recovery of shipping. These ships have simple construction and are therefore suitable for sailing in coastal areas, yielding significant benefits. Raw materials for manufacturing can be obtained from Shanghai and its hinterland. After these shipyards were taken over by the Japanese military after the war and handed over to Japanese shipping companies for management, they were only engaged in ship repairs. They will now start building wooden ships.</p>

<h3>National Forum: Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation and Suppress Prices - Preliminary Proposals for Organizing Baojia and Industrial Cooperation - Hu Jinyuan</h3>
<p>Since the Incident, prices in this city have risen sharply. Compared to 1937, the increase rate has been as high as several hundred times, with a general average of about seventy to eighty times. Although the authorities have repeatedly attempted to suppress prices, the black market is rampant, even intensifying, and has ultimately failed to achieve effective results. The crux of the matter lies not in the authorities' lack of strict enforcement, but in the powerful latent force of speculators and hoarders who disregard the law and continue to manipulate prices. The psychology of general citizens being alarmed by each other has also contributed to this. As soon as prices slightly fall back, they rush to buy in droves, thus strengthening the confidence of hoarders to profit from scarce goods. This city holds the key to the national economy, and its influence has caused prices to rise sharply throughout the country. Currently, the countermeasures rely on the wise and enlightened authorities to do their best to adjust the situation, and also require citizens to understand the will of the authorities and provide practical cooperation in order to achieve success. Now, based on my humble opinion, I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>Organization of Baojia Cooperatives. The establishment of the Baojia system in this city has made bandits disappear. The organization of Baojia cooperatives can eradicate speculation and hoarding. The effectiveness of cooperatives, whether in production, distribution, credit, or consumption, has convenient shortcuts, enabling direct links between producers and consumers to avoid the profiteering and exploitation of middlemen. Therefore, if the authorities can advocate and supervise the organization of consumer cooperatives based on the existing Baojia system, with one Jia or one Bao as a unit, such as "Consumption Cooperative of Bao No. X, District Y, Z Concession," initially conducting consumer business, raising funds to request allocations from various manufacturers, or directly ordering daily necessities from production and sales areas, and then distributing them to each member, every citizen will be a member of the cooperative, entitled to enjoy the right to cheap products, and hoarders will have no way to use their tricks. In terms of material management by the authorities, this can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. Once Baojia cooperatives are established, a federation of district Baojia cooperatives can be promoted, and then the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Cooperative Federation, so that capital is concentrated, connected to each other, and common welfare is sought, and collective procurement and distribution are even easier. Its contribution to people's livelihood and economy may also be of some help.</p>
<p>Organization of Industrial and Commercial Cooperatives</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry recently urged the reorganization of industrial associations, adjusting internal structures, and bringing them into line. Its intention is good. I believe that if we can further utilize its existing organization, various companies and firms should organize distribution and consumption cooperatives, with the industrial associations as a federation of cooperatives, and the highest organization being the Municipal Federation of All Trades Cooperatives. Its business, such as handling the purchase and allocation of raw materials and products, sharing common interests in various industries, and strengthening connections, will surely lead to a candid exchange of needed materials. The aforementioned Baojia cooperatives should also proceed in a complementary manner. This will not only allow the operations of various manufacturers and firms to develop in the right direction, but also greatly benefit the general public, and hoarding may also disappear as a result.</p>
<p>I lack both talent and knowledge, and I dare to offer my humble opinion. This is why I am throwing out a brick to attract jade, hoping to eliminate speculation and hoarding, suppress prices, and maintain people's livelihood. I hope that wise authorities and leading figures from all walks of life will conduct joint research and promote its concrete implementation. The people will be very fortunate!</p>

<p>Economic Circles: Commentary</p>
<h3>"Economic Exchange is Necessary"</h3>
<p>Recently, Minister of Finance Zhou Fo Hai and Mayor of Shanghai Chen Gong Bo both made pertinent remarks on the relationship between economic exchange and food issues when meeting with journalists in North China. Minister Zhou said: "North China is the North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government is the Central Government of North China; the National Government will do its utmost to provide relief for the food problem, material exchange, and financial accommodation of transaction funds in North China." Mayor Chen said: "Regardless of North and South, economic exchange is necessary: food is only a part of the economy." From the remarks of Zhou and Chen, one can draw a conclusion that the solution to the most serious food problem at present should still be based on the fundamental principle of economic exchange; the so-called economic exchange not only refers to the transportation and transfer of food or other goods, but also to the exchange of funds between cities and rural areas, in order to alleviate the widespread economic panic.</p>
<p>Recently, among the measures taken by the government to solve the food problem, in addition to issuing food treasury bills, constructing warehouses, and purchasing and storing food, the most noteworthy is the matter of rural revitalization loans. Now, banks with strong capital in this city, after completing the investigation of rural conditions and cultivation situations in various places, are currently organizing jointly to handle rural revitalization loans. Such a measure can be said to be in line with the principle of "economic exchange," and the natural result is the improvement of rural conditions and the increase in food production. However, one point that the lending banks must pay attention to is that the loan amount is not too large, and the direction of the loan must be clear. The simplest sentence is that the loans for rural revitalization must penetrate into the fields and reach the farmers directly, and must not be used by any intermediary institution. Because we have too much expectation for rural revitalization, we have said everything about rural loans.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Promulgates General Rules for Industrial Associations, Designates Preparatory Committees for Ten Industrial Associations, and Sets a Deadline for All to Be Organized by the End of May</h3>
<p>In order to adjust and strengthen the wartime economic structure and form a unified organization to adapt to the National Government's wartime economic policy, the Ministry of Industry proposed the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations at the National Defense Conference of the National Government. The existing industrial associations were reorganized, and for major commodity associations, county-level or special cities were used as units to establish associations with legal personality. Representatives of each association organized the Industrial and Commercial Association Federation, which is the lower-level agency of the professional department of the National Commercial Control General Association, in order to adjust the control work of private collection and allocation agencies. The above adjustment steps for the Industrial and Commercial Association Federation have been decided by the Committee for Reorganizing Industrial Associations of the Ministry of Industry through repeated meetings. The classification and names of the sixteen major commodity industrial and commercial association federations have been published successively. In addition to the fact that the preparatory committees and preparatory directors of the Cotton Products Industry, Soap and Candle Industry, Match Industry, and Tobacco Leaf Industry Federations were designated by the Ministry of Industry and have successively established initiator meetings, preparatory committees and preparatory directors for the Rubber Industry and other ten industrial associations are now designated and must be organized and established by the end of this month to enrich the organization of the National Commercial Control General Association. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry separately appointed supervisory officials of the competent industrial and commercial association federations to guide the organization and supervise the association affairs. This time, the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, totaling 31 articles, and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Association Federations, totaling 15 articles, are very detailed. The list of designated preparatory committee members and appointed supervisory officials for the ten industrial associations is listed below:</p>

<h3>Recent Opinions of Financial Circles on the "Small Industry Loan Syndicate"</h3>
<p>At the current stage of industrial development in Shanghai, the position occupied by handicrafts and small industries is quite important. The loan problem of various banks for these small industries has been particularly valued by the general public since the Greater East Asia War. Recently, the authorities have been working hard to establish the self-system of financial institutions and thoroughly crack down on hoarding. It is generally believed that the Ministry of Industry may implement some effective methods for revitalizing small industries.</p>
<p>In the past, the financial and industrial circles of the concession jointly advocated the organization of a "Small Industry Loan Syndicate." Recently, a part of the financial circles has put forward more specific opinions, and the main points of their opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Organizational content of the Small Industry Loan Syndicate: With the National Government or the Central Reserve Bank as the center, the Banking Association, the Qianye Association, etc. jointly invested tens of millions of yuan in lending funds, and set up a special committee to be responsible for managing and guiding its lending business, and recruited economists from the financial and industrial circles and other authoritative people to participate in this committee. (2) Lending objects: Hand-industrial factories, small mechanical factories, and small factories are the lending objects, but there are the following restrictions: (1) Those with funds of more than 10,000 yuan and less than 100,000 yuan (2) Those who manufacture non-luxury goods (3) Those who are currently starting work (4) Those who have joined the industrial association of the industry Lending purposes: The purposes of loans are limited to expanding factory equipment and purchasing various raw materials, etc. (4) Loan amount:</p>
<p>In principle, it should not exceed three-quarters of its funds. (5) Loan guarantee: Limited to machines, raw materials, products, etc. (6) Loan interest: In principle, low-interest loans are the guiding principle. (7) Loan method: The committee will investigate the production status of each factory at any time, and will punish those who falsely apply or use the loan for improper purposes according to the circumstances. Those who have achieved remarkable results in small industries after using the loan will be rewarded. The specific methods are roughly as above. At this time, the abuse of small banks and the plan of the concession system are good methods for improving financial activities and promoting legitimate businesses. (May 4, China Continent News)</p>
<h3>The Flour Association Formulates Membership Qualification Standards</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Flour Industry Association was ordered to be established, the number of applicants for registration has been very enthusiastic. Now, in order to review the qualifications of members, the standards for membership are specifically set as follows: (one of the following items is sufficient)</p>
<p>(1) Those who have always been engaged in flour and hold a business license from the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>(3) Those who have directly ordered their brands or persons in charge from various flour mills in this area, have had a stack list account name, have a history of more than three years, and are currently certified by the factory.</p>
<p>(4) Those who have purchased flour from the flat-selling flour wholesalers designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1940 and are currently certified by any two of the wholesalers.</p>
<p>(5) Those who are engaged in bran and are currently members of the Municipal Bran Industry Association, and are certified by the association.</p>
<h3>French Concession Tobacco Exchange Association Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Tobacco Exchange Association and the French Concession Tobacco Exchange Mutual Aid Society have been investigated by the police and found that the two organizations were engaged in black market trading and violated the statutes and public order of the two organizations, and have been ordered to stop working immediately and complete the closure within eight days (until May 10). Xu Wenxiang, the person in charge of the two organizations, has received a written notice of the above decision from the French authorities. Hereafter, all actions that claim to represent the names of the two organizations should not be believed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Former County Merchants Association Can Organize a Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to transfer to the Ministry of Industry for verification whether the former Shanghai Baoshan, Chuansha and other county merchants associations should be under the jurisdiction of the association. It is now approved that the war-time economic system does not have to adhere to the administrative system. For Shanghai, Baoshan, Chuansha, Chongming, Jiading, Nanhui, Fengxian and other seven counties, if there is already a county merchants association organization, they are not subordinate to each other. If it is necessary in fact, it is possible to organize a Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants Association Federation to connect and prosper. The Municipal Government has approved the transfer to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for information.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fell first and then recovered. The market situation was particularly good at noon. Among the new pharmaceutical industries, the price of Asia New Pharmaceutical Factory rebounded the most. The China-France Pharmacy has risen too much in recent days. It has already seen a decline, and the rise and fall of the department store industry is the most active. The prices of Yong'an, Xin Xin, and Guohuo Companies have all seen a small reduction. Underwear is also weak. Yong'an Yarn Factory and Meiya Silk Factory saw that the low price was picked up by buyers. The price of small par value textile industry is still stagnant. The culture industry, Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and World Book Bureau had a rare and stagnant price. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Greater China Match slightly saw a small reduction. Jiu'an Industrial slightly rose. The buying momentum of New Yick Land Property Company tended to be flat.</p>
<h3>After the Promulgation of the Law on Punishing Hoarding, Prices Plummeted</h3>
<p>The black market transactions in the city's speculative markets were affected by the death penalty or life imprisonment for speculators who hoard and manipulate prices, which was promulgated yesterday. As a result, the speculators participating in the black market were extremely panicked and rushed to sell off their inventories. Also, because the general hoarders were deeply afraid of being prosecuted, they did not dare to absorb spot goods, causing the black market prices of various commodities such as gold, gauze, securities, daily necessities, etc. to fall by 10% to 20% yesterday. However, although the transaction prices in the black market have fallen, the prices of goods sold in retail stores have not fallen, and even the retail prices of many goods are still the prices at the highest price in the past. The relevant authorities will also thoroughly investigate.</p>

<h3>Starting with Tolerance</h3>
<p>— Zhou Su</p>
<p>Tolerance is a virtue. However, tolerance that does not see the facts clearly and does not ask right from wrong is an evil act.</p>
<p>Patience is also a virtue. However, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, endurance that is simply one-sided is also an evil act.</p>
<p>For example, we should not be tolerant or patient with speculators and hoarders who disrupt social finance and hinder people's lives. "Indulgence breeds evil" is indeed a very true saying.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun has these words in his short essay "Experience": "Some newspaper readers no longer pay attention to declarations, telegrams, speeches, talks, etc., no matter how ornate and grandiose they are. They even go so far as not only not paying attention, but even using them as materials for sarcastic laughter..." This was said several years ago, but the situation is still the same now, and even worse than before.</p>
<p>When buying theater tickets, everyone squeezes and grabs to be the first, but they stand by and watch public welfare matters, and don't care. In fact, it is a matter that is closely related to everyone's interests, but it looks as if it has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>The most tragic, pathetic, shameful, and pitiful thing in the world is—</p>
<p>"Treating the real as fake, and treating the fake as real.</p>
<p>Not being tolerant and patient with things that should be tolerated and endured. And tolerating and enduring things that should not be tolerated and endured.</p>
<p>Treating playful things as serious matters. And treating serious matters as jokes and games."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Miscellany (1)</h3>
<p>— Hashimoto Kansetsu</p>
<p>Japanese poet Nishina Hakugyo said: "The Kun fish disdains to be a fish again, the Peng bird disdains to be a sparrow again. They only worry that the six directions are too narrow, how can they provide the Kun Peng with soaring and leaping?" Who said that Zhuangzi was blowing a conch shell there. From the Solomons in the south, to the East Indies, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, they are all crouching under the wings of my divine eagle. Drilling into the sky and entering the earth was once regarded as an incredible magic, but now it has become a reality. I just sneaked over from the seabed of Moji, but now I am already in the sky, flying in the azure sky at several thousand meters.</p>
<p>Following the direction pointed by Captain Tomonaga, Jeju Island is already in sight. There is still some remaining white snow on the mountain. From the ship, the mountain peaks seem quite high, but looking down from the plane, it is as if they are sliding under our feet. Seeing the turbid seawater from the clouds, we know that we are approaching the Yangtze River soon. Chongming Island at the mouth of the river is spread out below like a drying net. Chongming Island has a very large area, but there is not an inch of wasted land. Everything is cultivated in an orderly manner, which is really surprising.</p>
<p>In "Remnants of the Southern Inspection," I pointed out that even the tops of the mountains in the Zhoushan Islands, which are dotted like stars on a chessboard, are planted with horticulture, which shows the diligence of the Chinese people. The Chinese people who are directed by the Japanese are only the bad and ugly aspects of the lower class. If we think that all Chinese people are like this, then we are looking at people through a crack in the door, and even people become flat. Near Jiujiang, there are torrential rains every year, and the water level can rise by fifty feet overnight. Everyone thinks that the lowlands like the mouth of the Yangtze River will be submerged by floods, right?</p>
<p>Knowing that this is the case, they still tirelessly immerse themselves in cultivation. They often quarrel with each other for a blade of grass on the edge of the field. Their diligence and patience are really beyond people's imagination. Take a washbasin, for example. In addition to being used for cooking, it is also used for washing. To put it bluntly, it is even used as a toilet. They are such hardworking people. The Chinese people are really a people worth marveling at. We should correct our previous erroneous understanding. A certain reporting director in Shanghai once said: "There are many great people in China, but unfortunately there is no one to command them." In fact, this is also true in Japan.</p>
<p>However, precisely because there is no one to command them, they can unite and work under the rule of Tianwei. This is truly the happiness of the people. In addition to correcting our understanding of the Chinese people, we should also know that true peace in Asia can only be established through mutual cooperation with the Republic of China, and we should advance together with the spirit of mutual concession and mutual respect. The concept of despising the Chinese people must be liquidated.</p>
<p>I have been to Shanghai several times, and I am not very clear about it myself. However, the face of Shanghai that I saw this time is completely different from the previous times. The Japanese concession is small, not to mention that foreign concessions are generally clean. After revisiting the old place after four years, I immediately felt a great beauty. When I told the locals about this feeling, they felt the same way. The Shanghai that I am talking about now is not just superficial beauty. Although the colors of various countries are still clearly remaining in the British and French concessions in order to eliminate the so-called "inter-concession" or "French concession" distinction, the shackles that have bound us for hundreds of years have finally been broken. Greater Shanghai has become an entire region, and we are more delighted with this change than anything else. And the disappearance of the arrogant postures of the British and Americans striding in front of us yellow people is even more delightful.</p>
<p>Old friends who were temporarily scattered due to the incident have returned one by one, and some have even held important positions in the Nanjing government. I don't like interacting with people very much, so I have very few people who can be called confidants. Once everyone gets along, our friendship often lasts for ten, twenty, or even thirty years without wavering. When these people see me coming, they always shake hands and talk happily.</p>
<p>There is currently a so-called Cultural Association in Shanghai, most of whom are wealthy officials who like to make a few strokes, but folk painters have no share. Occasionally, when a painting is finished, it is regarded as a treasure. Even a very simple one is a great effort for them.</p>
<p>There are now more than one hundred and forty or fifty people engaged in painting among the people. The famous ones include Fu Tien-nien, Chien Shou-tieh, Sun Song, Chi Sheng, etc. September 9th every year is Painter's Day. In addition to the above-mentioned people, the initiators include Hsia Ching-kuan, Chou Lien, Ho Tien-chien, Wang Hsien, Sun Hsueh-ni, etc. I heard from the Japanese that they collect paintings made by Sun Song. This person's paintings imitate Wu Changshuo and only get his superficiality. Those who are deeply poisoned by Wu have neither Wu's learning nor Wu's spirit. Many Japanese painters do not like Wu Changshuo's paintings, especially young writers. This is because Wu himself does not think he is a painter. Seal carving is his specialty, and the Chinese call him the first person since the Song Dynasty. This may be true. Seal carving flourished from the Han Dynasty and soon declined. In the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, Ting Tun-ting and Ho Hsueh-yu emerged, and they were extremely popular for a time. In recent years, no one can be called a master. Wu Changshuo's poems are also known for their subtlety among modern Chinese people, not just for their rhetoric. I'm talking too far, let's get back to the topic.</p>
<p>Today, after the deaths of Wu Changshuo, Wang Yiting, and Yu Yushuang, Chien Shoutieh is the most recent leader in the Shanghai art world. This is not because of favoritism. He lived in my place for a long time in 1927 and returned to Shanghai a few years ago. He is forty-two years old this year and is gradually entering a mature stage. He is constantly working hard on ancient calligraphy and paintings. (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 20)</p>
<h3>Adaptation and Life</h3>
<p>— Qi Luo</p>
<p>This is a world where the "fit" survive. If you cannot "adapt," you cannot survive. Therefore, daily life striving for survival is called "adaptation."</p>
<p>Every move in daily life is an act of "adaptation." The same thing will produce various different "adaptation" behaviors due to the different personalities of each person, and therefore many different results occur. "Adaptation" can bring satisfaction to people. Because human satisfaction is obtained based on two methods, "adaptation" can also be explained from two aspects.</p>
<p>Good "adaptation" can make a person energetic, happy, and strive to improve; making his life a meaningful "life," indirectly creating social progress. On the contrary, bad "adaptation" makes people lifeless, decadent, and focused on self-interest; only a "life" full of gray. Even if he is lucky enough to dominate in society for a while, he will eventually be eliminated by others and become a part of failure and destruction, despised by the world.</p>
<p>"Adaptation" behavior is not innate, but learned. It is very easy to form habits due to multiple "adaptations." Therefore, once bad "adaptation" has become a deeply rooted habit, it cannot be easily corrected. There are often many extremely bad "adaptation" behaviors, such as: cowardice, eccentricity, evasion of responsibility, procrastination, fear, terror, depression, and烦恼, which are all developed from childhood. After growing up, they become many factors of failure. Therefore, we must pay attention to our children's actions as soon as possible, cultivate their good "adaptation" behaviors, and prevent them from being discredited in the future.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for good "adaptation" behavior is that when we satisfy our personal motivations, we do not harm others. In addition, with rich knowledge, profound cultivation, and upright emotions and other great forces, good "adaptation" behavior can be produced.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we can properly "adapt" without complaining, then the god of "success" is waving to us frequently!</p>
<h3>Appreciating Flowers in the Kong Garden</h3>
<p>— Zi Jian</p>
<p>Being trapped by official documents all day is not as good as the late spring. I happened to read a newspaper report that Kong Zhiqing was selling flowers to help the poor, and I suddenly had the desire to visit.</p>
<p>Kong Garden is located at the end of Shanzhong Road, surrounded by fences. Its width is less than one mu, and there is a thatched pavilion in the middle, which is a place for the owner to rest. As soon as I entered the garden, I faintly smelled a clear fragrance that penetrated my mind, and my heart felt refreshed. Looking up at the surroundings, there were potted plants and trees everywhere, and all kinds of potted flowers and trees were arranged without any omissions. Moreover, the scenery was full of poetic feelings, sparse shadows, quiet and leisurely. Looking down at close range, the spring was full of life, and pine, cypress, bamboo, and stones each showed their beauty. Such as the "Green Snow Protecting the Dragon" and "Zhang Bian Descending the Demon" scenes, are quite likable. Occasionally, there are one or two figures, dotted among them, which makes one feel the infinite scenery and is thought-provoking. There is also a rockery, less than a foot high, but the peaks, ridges, and ravines are deep and beautiful. There are three cypresses on the coffin, which are old and strong, dancing and welcoming people, which is the characteristic of the garden, making people envious. Later, I welcomed Mr. Kong in the thatched pavilion and asked about the method of bonsai. Mr. Kong smiled and replied: This way seems simple but is actually complicated, and cannot be fully explained in a short time. I sighed for a long time. Then, the sun was about to set, and the twilight was approaching, so I reluctantly returned.</p>
<h3>An "Artistic" View of "Life"</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>"Life" should be shaped, carved, and highlighted as meticulously as sculpture and painting, using the expression and ideal of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty."</p>
<p>"Human works" that express selfless emotions through "altruistic behavior" are the crystallization of "art." These "works" are one's own behavior and thoughts. Originally! A beautiful "life" is a precious artistic creation of mankind.</p>
<p>Both philosophy and art regard "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty" as the main "purpose" of life and the fundamental law of creation. Combining the two, it is nothing more than the starting point for creating one's own life and the essence of life.</p>
<p>"Truth" is "reason," and reason is buried under the surface phenomena, so it needs to be excavated. And "reason" is developing along with the reality of things, so it must be grasped in all aspects of the relationship between things and its development. Recognizing and pursuing reason is not an easy task, because we will inevitably use "habitual," "common-sense," and "subjective" views, so we must overcome these in order to seek reason. Therefore, how much reason a person can obtain can determine how much achievement he has.</p>
<p>The starting point of "Beauty" is "Truth." If it is not true, it is not "beautiful," so beauty and truth are closely related. The life in our "ideal" is a "beautiful" life. Loving beauty is a noble nature of mankind. The "beauty" of the soul is the starting point of all undertakings. The "beauty" that does not harm one's own morality and personality is one of the most important tasks in life.</p>
<p>"Goodness" is responsible behavior in personality. "Ultimate Goodness" is "Ultimate Beauty." "Good" behavior is the driving force of "Truth." The purpose of a person's life is nothing more than to obtain the fulfillment of "Goodness." To obtain it, one must start with self-cultivation.</p>
<p>In short, an "artistic view of life" is the essence of "life," it is unique and transcendent. "Art" cannot be separated from "life," and "life" cannot be separated from "art." The value and purpose of "life" are fundamentally based on the pursuit of the noble realm of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty."</p>
<h3>Fate</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chuang</p>
<p>The development of all things must have a certain internal basis, but its accidental form of discovery, that is to say, there are reasons for various conditional bases within the development process of a thing, and this is produced: but the form of discovery is not necessarily "accidental", this small certain form, is also a certain "inevitable" to produce, so the emergence or change of all things Kenzai carefully studied the internal development of the situation, will not feel that this is special of course, this is an unbreakable theorem.</p>
<p>But there are many people who do not study these, and all things are successful and failed because of "fate". Successful ones are of course included here, and failed ones are also included here. Even normal life is called "fate" like this, and it cannot be remedied.</p>
<p>Some people do not feel their own lack of effort and progress, but they feel that their "fate" is not good. Some people work very hard and make progress, but they do not understand the current situation of society, and they do not seek to understand these things. When their lives are not satisfied, they say that their "fate" is not good. Some people do not understand their own strengths and weaknesses. When they are proud, they think that their "fate" is good, and they do not use their own strengths and how to reduce their weaknesses. When they fail, they cannot be recovered, saying that their "fate" has begun to be bad, and they do not understand the reasons for failure? The so-called "wealth and honor are determined by fate, and life and death are in the hands of God" is a sentence that takes things for granted and blindly believes that this is the power of God and the arrangement of "fate", leading to this path. I don't know how many people have been harmed? I don't know how many hopeful and promising people have been ruined in the hands of the word "fate"? I also don't know who is doing evil and deceiving so many people for such a long period of time?</p>
<h3>Supplement to Street Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Liu Shiwen</p>
<p>Kangqu Road in Nan City was built to commemorate Mr. Liu Kangqu. Mr. Liu's name is Xin Cheng, and his hao is Kangqu. He is from Yifeng, Jiangxi. He participated in the revolution in his early years and made great contributions. He followed Premier Sun in Guangdong and Guangxi. The people sang his praises. After the success of the revolution, he served as the representative of the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, the representative of the Patrol Envoy of Guangdong and Guangxi, and the military representative sent by the Grand Marshal's Office to Zhejiang. He was a loyal believer of the Father of the Nation, Sun Premier. He is sixty-two years old this year. Although he is over sixty years old, his spirit is full and his work is diligent, which is beyond the reach of today's youth.</p>

<p>Precious Inkstone Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Tickets Help Education</p>
<p>Since its opening on the 1st, the Bao Yan Bin Painting Exhibition on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association has been visited by people from all walks of life in an endless stream. They have praised the richness of Mr. Ha's collection and the large number of fine works. They have recognized the iron inkstone from the Song Dynasty in the collection as a rare treasure. It is said that the exhibition has only one day left today, and the 500 yuan from the sale of tickets has been donated to the newspaper's education fund.</p>
