<h3 id="c1">國民康與衛生行政 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>全國第一屆衛生行政會議，今日在首都舉行。衛生行政會議之目的，無疑是在加强衛生行政效能，擴展公共衛生，以期促進國民健康。我們會於九日社評中，提供指導靑年運動者，首先應重視靑年體格健全的鍛鍊。因爲個人學間事業的成就，賴於精力，精力則繫於强健的體格。如果體格衰弱，精力不繼，縱有滿腹經綸，必致力不從心難爲世用，豈不可惜！個人如此，推而至於社會國家莫不如此。所以，國民健康與國家事業的關係，實在太密切！太重大了！</p>
<p>國民健康的促進，一在於積極的體格鍛鍊，抵抗疾病；一在於消極的謹守衛生，防止疾病。鍛鍊與衛生同樣重要，尤須同時並行，不可偏廢。鍛鍊方面，如體育運動等。衛生方面，比較範圍廣泛，舉凡衣食住行以及一切生活行爲莫不涉及，簡言之，衛生就是合理化的生活。譬如衣服須調節寒暖，飲食須節制過飽，居室須流通空氣，行路須安步當車等等，道理雖簡，實屬衛生之道。</p>
<p>個人衛生固重要，公共衛生尤其重要。公共衛生是與公衆有密切關係，也是社會事業，因爲是社會事業，就離不了社會環境與社會組織。譬如說防疫，是公共衛生，在衛生知識普遍發達的社會裹，一到時令，一紙公吿，公衆就自動的請求或接受預防注射，或遵守指導執行撲滅疫菌工作。可是，在衛生知識尙未普遍灌輸的社會裹就不同了，雖則一再勸諭，還是漠視，非至强迫干涉無法實施。這於本市衛生當局每年夏令防疫注射的措施中，可以證明。就是說，中國社會裹，對於公共衛生知識，尙未普遍灌輸，推行公共衛生時，不無阻碍，因此，我們盼望衛生當局認淸與把握這一點，在平時不斷的從公典衛生知識方面，盡量宣傳，尤其是公共塲所，特別注意。同時在學校方面，加强公共衛生的敎育指導。以期從根本上普及國民衛生知識。</p>
<p>衛生行政是推進公共衛生的發動機，措置的得當與否，關係於公共衛生的前途，自極重要。而行政最重要的原則，也在於把握社會環境，視其需要，衡以經濟狀况以及本身能力，決定適合現狀的行政計劃。當然，衛生行政計劃，並不是一味遷就社會實際，而不顧理論。可是，一味重視理論，抄襲適應於不同的社會環境之行政計劃，也是萬萬行不通的。譬如說目前在戰時狀態，物價高漲，大部分人民對於雜糧粗肴尙難應付，而根據衛生營養原理，仍提倡牛奶麵包，這就是不合社會環境的一例。其次，我們知道凡是實現一種行政計劃，離不了人才與經費二者，衛生行政，當然不能例外。於此，我們盼望衛生常局更須顧到現實，不求急功，寗可決定切實易行的平常計劃，而使之實現，使之收效，遂漸擴展。根據於高深理論，遠大目標的計劃，在此人才經費兩不可能的當前，與其無法實現，不如不必提出。</p>
<p>衛生行政會議，其重要性與其他政治經濟會議，毫無二致，我們口獻上面的兩點，雖足具體方案，甚願衛生當局中視這一原則而把握之，公共衛生前途，國民健康前途幸甚！幸甚！</p>
<p>更正</p>

<h3 id="c2">波島四次海空戰　日軍建光輝戰果　敵艦三艘炸沉二艘受重創 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營於十四日下午三時發表。日海航空部隊於十三日拂曉在波根維爾島南方海面怒擊敵機動部隊，收獲戰果如次　炸沉敵大型巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，炸傷驅逐艦一艘，重創敵戰艦一艘，中型航空母艦一艘。日方損害飛機未返者二架。註本次空戰稱爲第四次波根維爾島海面空戰。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營於十四日發表第四次波根維爾島海面空戰之光輝戰果，茲據此間軍事專家談其詳情稱，敵艦隊屢戰屢北飽受痛創，似已不支潰退，十三日拂曉配有戰艦航空母艦驅逐艦之强力敵艦隊，間接護衛運輪船團，於玻根維爾島西南方水域北進，日海軍攻擊機隊經發現此强力之敵艦隊後，常即於上午三時左右以雷擊機爲主力出動，瞬即飛至敵艦隊上空，冒敵艦無熾烈之高射砲火發射魚雷，炸沉大型巡洋艦一艘，及巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘收獲莫大戰果。繼又迫擊企圖遁逃之殘除敵艦，復重創敵戰艦一艘，及中型航空母艦一艘，該航空母艦已自後甲板　出濃煙，故未能確見其已被擊沉，但諒其必已沉沒。是役日方亦損失飛機二架，敵方企圖於接濟波根維爾島特羅基納角登陸軍，使後繼部隊登陸，並欲擊潰我南方第一綫戰略要衝拉巴爾航空部隊，敵方此種企圖已被日軍粉碎，並遭日軍四度激烈之反攻。按戰鬥機於夜間出擊實極困雖，但經已曾受過積極猛訓練之日海軍機以其英勇之精神與卓越之神技，始能克此艱難而得收穫此種偉大戰果。</p>
<p>日陸軍機奇襲　新幾內亞緬甸</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營於十四日下午二時三十八分發表；　新幾內亞島方面日陸軍航空部隊於十一月六日至九日四日間，述續襲擊拉姆河及麥加姆河流域之馬查布及顚比等敵機塲，並與地上部隊協力邀擊敵機，收獲戰果如次：（包括十一月八日發表之戰果。）擊落敵機五十九架，（未證實者十七架）敵機停於地上者被擊燬及起火焚燒者共一二〇架以上，日方損害自炸及未返防者十五架。　緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊於九日及十一日轟炸印度東部之印巴爾巴　爾及希爾齊亞等地敵機塲，收獲戰果如次：敵機停於地上者被擊毀及起火焚燒者共三十三架以上，敵燃料堆積塲三處中彈起火，日方無投害。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十四日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美海軍部十三日發表：日軍航空隊曾於十一日夜轟炸太平洋埃利斯羣島（Ellice）及紐美亞島（Noumea）之反軸心軍根據地，反軸心軍兵員及設施蒙有損害。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日雷擊機隊造成　海戰史空前勝利 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日軍雷飛機隊，最近已在玻根維爾島海面，收獲眞珍珠灣海戰以來之驚人戰果。於前後兩次空戰中，炸沉敵戰艦四艘，航空母艦二艘，艦船十九艘，並炸毀敵巡洋艦等十一艦，此實爲世界海戰史上之空前勝利，足證日雷擊隊技術之優秀。夫所謂雷擊機者，乃一種單發動機之飛機，將空中魚雷裝於機翼之下，用以攻擊敵方主力艦，航空母艦，巡洋艦等。惟其魚雷，須於掠過海面飛近敵艦時發射，此種進攻之雷擊機，且只載魚雷一枚，而發放時必須在低空，如自高空投下，則往在海面爆炸。又當發射魚雷時，除須一發中的外，並須有優良之技術，出生入死，營門以炸沉敵航空母艦。且常此時，尤須首先與敵前護之飛機交綏，將其擊落之後，又遭敵驅逐艦開砲轟擊，繼又將遭受敵巡洋艙之砲擊，然後始能向敵航空母艘攻擊。其時更須戰勝該艦防與炮火及直接護衛該艦之飛機，如以戰艦爲目標，則必將遭受敵艦平射砲之轟擊，縱不被砲彈擊中，亦將觸水雷而　，不然又將遭敵高射炮機關槍之猛擊。此關渡過，更須謹愼發　魚雷，以完成炸沉敵艦使命，綜上所述，可知其炸沉戰艦與航空母一艦實極困難。</p>
<h3 id="c4">全國衛生行政會議　僅晨在首都揭幕　收到全部提案百餘件 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　衛生署召閒之第一次全國衛生行政會議，自籌備以來，業已就緒。特定今（十五）日在中日文化協　隆重揭幕。各地代表均已紛紛來京，收到提案共一百餘件。大會主席爲衛生署長陸潤之，秘書長爲衛生署秘書長林鵬　。預定於今日會議前上午八時半，由大會主席率領全體出席列席人員，恭往國父陵寫　陵致敬畢，即於十時在中日文化協會舉行會議。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　衛生署爲强化衛生行政機構，並爲明瞭各地衛生設施狀况，籌商各種改進方案起見，決定召集全國各省市衛生負責首腦，及各地衛生人員等，舉行第一次全國衛生行政會議。按自國一府還都南京後，對衛生行政機　並未單獨設立，僅在內政部內設有衛生司，職掌衛生事務。其後國府當局，鑒於衛生行政影響民族健康至深且鉅，若不確立機構，實不足以推行盡利。故於本年四月間，決議專設衛生署，以恢復戰前制度。隨後有關方面即厘訂組織規則，積極　備，至此衛生行政，　獲得進一步之準展。六月問，行政院會議決議通過，特任陸潤之爲衛生署長。陸氏自接任後，即積極努力推進全國衛生行政事宜，同時該署復爲明暸全國各地衛生設施狀况，以爲推進全國衛生行政之參考，乃訂定分期視察計劃，先後赴蘇浙皖華北等地視察。在華北時，陸氏更參加華北中華民國醫學會會議，經數度商洽，該中華民國醫學會決定撤消，改爲中華醫學會北京分會。至此全國衛生行政機構，乃告統一。而際此中日同盟條約簽訂伊始，我國完全獨力自主之時，欲分担大東亞戰爭與建設之責任，尤須有强雷之體魄、故此次衛生行政會議之召開，實有重大意義。該會議之會議範圍，雖有　衛生行政，一醫藥管理，　公共衛生，　衛生敎育，　預防病疫，　健康保險，　行旅衛生，　衛生統計等事項，但尤着重於行政機構及其效率。預防病疫，及衛生人員訓練等事項，以期統一推進全國衛生行政，確保國民健康。故此次會議，各方甚爲重視與期待，預料該會議完畢後，全國衛生行政當有劃期進展，對民族健康，亦當有莫大宜獻。</p>

<p>— 白門</p>
<p>合理化的生活</p>
<p>院生過著合理化的生活。首先在養的方面，姚主任說「在一般兒童福利機關，因爲經濟困難，多不能滿足兒童標準的物質生活，本院也有這極苦衷，要使在水準以下的物質生活的兒童，保持健康，所以對於衣食住的管理，絕對用科學方法，爭取效能，並且要訓練兒意手腦並用，鍛練兒童身體和節省經費。」說着，帶着記者去參觀廚房，淸潔整齊，是最先的印象。幾個女生正在洗濯碗碟，整理燃料。一個男生在切麵機旁忙着，晚餐已在準備了，看不出遭倒是一個小技師，不僅能製麵，而且還會修理機械呢！好比小小的　山泊，這裏有來自各階級的孩子，也有各色專技天才兒童！</p>
<p>院生衣食住以及各方面的繁覆工作，都在慈幼服務團領導之下，由兒童個別的或集體的操作，甚至連幼童部，也不聘用保姆，只訓練年長的女生，擔任小保姆的工作，藉以發展兒童友愛精神。即如傳達等等公務，也完全由兒童擔任。所以，上海慈幼敎養院，可說是上海惟一不用工役，實現澈底的自治，獲得理想之成績的一個兒童福利機關。</p>
<p>飲食方面，全由慈幼服務團中的飮食部負責，分設四股，烹調股負責分配廚房工作人員，研究並指導　調方法。司賬股　理小菜賬目，購買股每日隨同敎員至菜塲買菜；保管股保管一切米，麵，油，鹽及燃料，飮食用具等等。現在該部也由覺護　職員汪　卿女士負責指導。</p>
<p>三樓和四樓是院生的宿會，大部分房間都是女生臥室，男生臥室只佔一小部分。每一間臥室內，一律是雙層鐵床，一律是用的白布被單，每人各有一條被傳和其他枕頭等用品，經常舉行臥室淸潔競賽，所以每人臥室門口都掛着鮮艷的等第牌，待別是淸潔錦標，高高的掛着，多麼高興。當然，男生似乎不大有得錦標的機會。</p>
<p>衛生工作在慈幼敎番院是和學業同樣被重視的。個人衛生方面，根據衛生部所頒布的衛生信條，由慈幼服務團個人衛生股每天檢查個人衛生。公共衛生方面，則有公共衛生股負責，每天打掃各塲所兩次，由兒究分區擔任。設股每天到各塲所檢查整潔，並配分比賽。</p>
<p>服務團設有醫藥股和請病股，前者管理藥品及履行醫生所規定的普通治療，後者看護病人，管理着病室，執行普通護士機務。所有這些，都由養護課職負指導院生自動服務。</p>
<p>他們特別注重於疾病的預防，打各種預防針，培養衛生習慣，注意體格檢查。每月由護士李淑英普檢一次，每年特請醫師詳檢一次或二次。如發現病生，輕症住該院特設的養病室，由駐院護士看護，重症則送時疫醫院，廣慈醫院，上海兒童醫院等，都可免費醫療，各醫院的好善精神，也着實値得欽敬。</p>
<p>命運的改造所</p>
<p>人問眞有所謂命運嗎？</p>
<p>然而在上海慈幼敎養院，却會用事實來答覆：縱使有所謂「命運」也者，但命運是可以改造的！看！他們收容敎養的，都是從各地區，從各階層裹來的，無衣無食又瘦又病的苦兒，差不多一個個部者不出還是人！這裏有鞭答磨難下的童養媳，婢女，這裹有街頭的流浪兒童，這裏有可憐的被拐聽者，和迷路者，這裹有喪失了父母的孤苦無依者，這裏有水旱天災下轉輾逃亡到上海的難童，這裏有因戰爭的砲火而喪失了一切的不幸者，這裹有因家道赤貧無力敎養的窮小子，這裏有被不良的家庭所遣　的可憐兒，這裏更有不得已而犯了「罪」的小罪犯……其中尤以婢女及受戰事影響的難童最多。這些男女苦兒，小的五六歲，大的十一·二歲，都是適合學齡的不幸兒童，也有一部份婢女年齡更大至十六七歲的。</p>
<p>經過上海慈幼敎養院的救濟和敎養，一個個都變成整齊，淸潔，健康，活撥的好孩子，痛苦無吿的和殘酷無道的舊時生活的烙印，已經悄悄地從小小的心扉上消逝了。其中有不少遠臨時找到新的出路，有的找到老家，骨肉團聚，有的找到新家，被領為養子養女；有的我到自立的大道，在工廠，南店，醫院和鐵路上服務。</p>
<p>當女生長大了。如有外界家境清白人格健全並有正當職業的青年，要求擇配，籌得女生同意，即可依一定手續，代爲舉行婚禮，看哪，會客室裏，不是滿　着院生舉行婚禮的紀念照相嗎，姚主任已經有了不少「乾女壻了」</p>
<p>姚主任說，該院所收容敎養的孩子，不問是重囘老家，被人領養而找到新家，或是代爲擇配結婚，或是代爲擇業到社會上去服務，都先經過嚴密的調查，愼重的研究，一切都出諸鄭重的態度，在實行時，更須經過嚴格的手　。出院以後，該院還纖續擔負保護之責，不問囘了老家或找到新家，院生仍須時時到院裹來，院方也常去訪問，保持連絡，即已嫁出的女生，也像普通人家蕬母一般的繼續關心，更歡迎婚後的新夫婦帶着小孩子去院裹盤桓。對於在社會服務的院生的關廠，當然更不待說。</p>
<p>升學也是上海慈幼敎養院院生主要的出路之一，凡是資質，性格適宜於向學上進的，都盡力助其升學，以求深造，據說慈幼小學畢業生已有七屆，共達六十餘人，其中有二十五人就在該院全力援助下繼織升學，已完成高中與初中的學程，在社會服市各著名中學，都爲各該學校的高材生，可爲難童吐氣　眉。</p>
<p>進院時是無食無衣又瘦又病的苦孩子，賽乎沒有人形，可是出院時都是又健康，又懂事，精神　滿志氣豪　的新少年了！</p>
<p>為了中華民族的將來，願大家祝福這理想的苦兒樂園吧　（完）</p>

<p>— 鄭雲英</p>
<p>敎育工作人員生活的淸苦，是盡人皆知的事實。當局欲切實加以敎濟，非開團固定的財源不可，而蓬者以為徵敢敎育附加稅，不失爲方法之一。</p>
<p>徵收敎育附加稅，在從前江蘇省就曾經有一部分縣敎育局實行過，在現在市府財政拮據情形之下，不妨實行一下，以資救濟敎職員生活。實行的對象，筆者以爲凡是一切的覆耗品都可以徵收，　如烟。酒。化妝品，奢侈品等，還有一切的娛樂塲所，都可以隨門票加徵百分之五或百分之十附加積，享受者決不會因了這一點附加稅，而覺得太苛，而敎職員却可以因爲多了這一筆可觀的收入，來補助生活，使得生活安定。</p>
<p>至於社會人士所發起的輸巨欵，捐金戒來救濟，教職員的生活，以及敎靑當局以五十萬元補助費貼補敎職員，杯水車薪，總不是根本的辦法。</p>
<p>徵收敎育附加稅做為增高敎職員的待遇，敎育工作者生活得以安定，而當局籌措巨欵的問題，亦可解決，一舉兩得，又何樂而不爲哉！（移酬助學）</p>
<h3 id="c19">保甲職員的　生活問題 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 蓓蓓</p>
<p>當此滬市行政，已漸　一元化的今日，保甲組織，亟需日臻健全，籍以協助政務的推進，警務的不足。最近內政部通令，今後民衆運動，責由各地保甲委員會負責督導。則保甲工作的展開，亦日益殷繁，而對於所屬幹部之一的—保甲職員，予以人事上的調整，資能上的考續，固屬切要，同時對於生活待遇的改善，要亦當務之急。世說有云：「有安定生活才有安定的工作」吾們監要工作效效的增進，本位員役工作的　勉，「精神生活」的訓練，固為第一；而於「物質生活」的合乎程度，使之能安心盡力，安心盡職，當爲第二。否則分化於服務的精神與心力，從而追求於衣食之謀，欲求功作效率的增進，且恐難有良好的效果。更有進者，狡　者環境實逼處此，將藉職務上的便利，以行其營私舞的勾當，亦　難免。質言之：當爲不平　社會制度下變態心理所造成失常的事實吧！</p>
<p>任何事業的發展，—保甲當為社會事業之一：需要良好的幹部人員，養成一個良好的幹部人員，平常時已不易易，當此非常時期，無論於指導上工作上，須有時代性的計劃與實務。而形成今日日趨重的生活問題，更屬支配於每個人心。—當然屬於低級亁部為甚。如小學敎員，小公務員，保甲職員等……幾乎整天為着生活的艱難，增加本身工作的痛苦，以致减少了事業的保力。</p>
<p>不是過火的說：健全保甲，直接間接，即可輔佐大上海市政的健全；改善保甲職員的生活待遇。使能無忝　職　為健全保甲的機要對策。我是一個市民，對於日常不辭勤勞為大衆服務的保甲職員，嚴重的生活問題，當表示無限的同情。寫成了這「請願式」的幾句話，呼額於質明的保甲當局之前，期待引起救濟的動議吧。</p>

<p>二月九日　接到敵機九架自里瑪伊及加夫卡便飛行塲離陸的情報後，我們立即出動二編隊，在瑪里員萊斯山西方發見敵機。我於柯萊希陀爾島上空方始加入戰鬭，因稍遲一步，未及對敵方P40式機迎頭一擊，僅對圖向南方逃遁的一架P40式一機從後面上方加以攻擊。一擊之下，使其油箱起火，向柯萊希陀爾島南方　擊；第二回進攻時，和敵機平行；再加以一擊，終於將它打下來。在這一次戰鬭中，我方編隊共擊擊敵機五架，重傷四架。</p>
<p>〇月〇日　調駐緬甸，攻擊汀斯基亞。</p>
<p>一月二十五日</p>
<p>〇〇的大編隊高翔緬甸的大平原，奮翅一飛，越過了三千公尺的阿拉干山脈，向汀斯基亞飛行塲前進。這是如雲似霞的大進軍，是我們至今未見的大壯觀，大征空行，飛行塲完全被燬，濛濛的黑烟　蔽了打斯基亞的天空，使敵完全　伏。我擔任上空擁護的任務，和山本中尉一同警戒飛行塲的西北，發見一架寇蒂斯P40式機，當即加以一擊，敵機向右旋　，我當然不放過這個好機會，趕緊經以第二擊，於是敵機機重近根處汽油直嘖，機體垂直降下，終於撞在地上——擊墜一架。趁勞向無烟溺浸的敵軍飛行塲作〇〇公尺的超低空飛行，向健在的一架P40式實行對地攻擊，穿過熾烈的防空砲火，再以超低空飛行攻擊P40式及高射砲陣地，將一架P40式完全擊燬。</p>
<p>二月〇日（吉大港攻擊）飛抵吉大港上空，炸壞敵機塲後，正打算飛回時，受到一架敵方旋風式機的攻擊，不客氣地予以同擊，馬上命中，敵機向下旋轉急墜，落在市街和飛行塲的中間地區，燒成灰燼。</p>
<p>十二月〇日（〇在〇〇上空發見敵方轟炸機十四架的大編隊。「遲啦！」心中這麼想若。「旋轉！」口裏喊着，身體早就跳進機內，踏開油門，拉動操縱杆。正在離陸時，機體已受到敵方的彈片，我也不去管它，祗打算和隊長機一同起飛，就由我們兩架飛機去邀擊他們。上昇中看到敵機一架被我方高射砲命中，發火墜下，更覺勇氣百倍，拚命迫擊。敵機分作三層，下面是六架旋風機，其上是六架P40式，再上面是五架勃倫哈烟式。我向第四架勃倫哈姆機的左引擊開槍，使之發火下墜。正當我想進攻第三架時，突受P40機的攻擊，當即與之決鬭、旋即將它打下，於是凱旋。</p>
<p>十二月〇〇日（芬尼攻擊）十二月二十四日（〇〇上空邀擊敵戰鬥機）〇〇上空，六架旋風機來襲。我機離陸已　稍遲，又因忘記踏開油門，速度也慢了一點。從敵機機方加以一擊，使其起火下墜，更迫一架敵機在伊洛瓦底扛的洲上起火着陸，看見有一個敵機操縱者從河中爬出來，當即通知地上部隊，不久這個飛行員就高舉雙手成為俘虜。綫過審問後，查明了他是少佐階級的。當出來襲的敵機。全部擊　。眞痛快！隊長擊下旋風機一架，宗曹長二架，穴吹軍曹三架。好興盛的中崎隊哪！</p>
<p>十二月〇〇日（雲南車站飛行塲攻擊）因為加油遲了五分鐘，開足油門迫趕主力，飛過怒扛，跨越瀾滄，仍未趕上，無奈袛好悵然而吃返餅迎新年，不禁懷念桑梓。</p>
<p>一月〇〇日（雲飛抵雲南聚行塲，轟炸機大顯身手，炸碎了飛機塲。敵方寇蒂斯P40式十五架中，六架上昇，受到攻擊後，反向飛去，再追上去一擊，立刻曳着一道白烟，向下墜落。</p>
<p>〇月〇〇日（仰光上空對轟炸機戰）「〇洋面上空敵機三架來　」，接报後勇躍起飛。大戰六囘合，擊擊廠方維卡斯·威林吞轟炸機一架。再想迫擊一架時，自己突然陷於昏迷狀態，直降到　海面二百五十公尺處方才淸醒過來。</p>
<p>一月〇〇日（〇〇上空與B24戰鬥）在仰光河口〇〇地貼上空，盤旋翱翔的七個黑點，便是敵空軍誇譽的統一式的特B24。我向前方三架編成一隊的第三架敵機攻擊，使它發烟。但它還想逃走，於是這上去再加一擊，它便曳着一道白烟，剩落在編隊後方。更給它最後的一擊，便忽然吐出黑烟，共右翼全為火炤所包，開始向地面下墜。本來還想去追趕第二架，可惜汽油和子彈都已用完，祇得收兵。</p>
<p>三月〇日（參加可克斯巴柴攻擊）我打下了二架旋風機</p>
<p>三月〇〇日（巴達飛行塲攻擊）擊下旋風機兩架。</p>
<p>四月〇〇日（杜巴薩里攻擊）擊墜旋風機一架。</p>
<p>四月〇〇日（第一次印帕爾攻擊）三架旋風機和我一架飛決鬥，結果被我打下二架，還有一架也被打壞。我方飛機全體歸還。在這一戰中，我方樹下擊　敵機十五架的赫赫戰績。猛事所向兮敵機全無，　　高奏兮唯我獨雄！</p>
<p>四月〇〇日（第二次印帕爾攻擊）擊P36式二架，其中一架在第一囘合中便吐出白烟，顛倒下　。</p>
<p>四月〇〇日（昆明飛行塲攻擊）與P40式十架交戰，打下一架。</p>
<p>五月〇〇日（可克斯巴柴攻擊）擊墜旋風機一架。落在海中的旋風機，祇遺下一沫水泡。</p>
<p>五月〇〇日（第二次昆明攻擊）待之已久的這次攻擊中，對方全是美空軍的精銳哪！敵手當然多啦。幹吧！向敵方巨型機二十架進攻四次後，遭受四十餘架寇蒂斯P40式的尾追攻擊。彼我雙方開始混戰，戰況激烈之機。我打散了敵機，順手救出了兩架友機。這樣力戰許時，使七架左右的敵機吐出白烟，確定已被打下者三架，但所寫愛機則一　子彈也未受到。所帶槍彈全部用完。</p>
<p>五月〇〇日（參加吉大港攻擊）擊　旋風機一架</p>
<p>五月〇〇日與旋風機十餘架交兵，在孟加拉灣上空打落二架。</p>
<p>十月八日（邀擊空襲仰光的B24式與P38式）　單機和十三架，敵機戰。機墜B24式三架，P38式二架。愛機受傷，被追降陸。第三日生還基地。左手指中彈，入院後〇〇部隊長親臨慰問，承說明戰法，光榮之至！每念及此，更顧奮鬥。緬甸方面陸軍最高指揮官亦派副官慰問，並蒙賜下摺扇一柄，不勝　激，唯期指傷早日痊瘉，庶可力戰征空，以答厚意。南方方面航空最高指揮官亦賜祝電，曰；「謹向貴隊穴吹軍曹之赫赫武動致敬。」（吉；譯自朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c32">一個兵曹在一天內　擊落敵機十架 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>南太平洋空戰之異績</p>
<p>少年飛行兵出身的年靑的海軍航空部隊上等飛行兵曹奧村武雄，造成了個人在一天中擊墜十架的光榮戰果。所羅門方，戰況極激烈的九月十四日，蒲印地方的日本海軍航空部隊，邀擊敵方前來襲擊的飛機二百四十架以上，協同地上砲火，擊墜其六十架，日方自炸未歸還老合計亦有五架。是日縱橫活躍的奧村上等飛行兵曹，由〇〇艦隊司令長官授與書有「武功拔羣」的白鞘軍刀一口。這個　在一天內擊墜十架的光榮記錄怎樣造成的呢？筆者訪問是日與奧村兵曹一同作戰的戰士們，獲悉是日空戰的經過：</p>
<p>一下手即擊落一架六點半，有敵機來襲的情報，戰鬥機〇〇架立即飛昇天空，巡哨三十五分鐘後在喬伊蘇爾島方面的遠距離，發見敵方的大編隊，即開始邀擊戰。亂眞　清，正是絕好的空戰天氣。敵方計　素里台特B24型機十一架，和戰鬥擭三十架，展閱　烈的空中戰。奧村兵奮一下手叩擊　薛料爾斯基一架，敵戰鬥機逐漸被我海軍機擊　七架，戰鬥機被遷之後，現在祗剩大型機了。我方〇架同時攻擊敵方一大型機，奧村兵曹擊中第一張，一面逃，一面追，用全速力追單二十分鐘後，被我機迫近猛射，敵機被中十數彈機，起火下　。</p>
<p>敵機已經遠飛逃走</p>
<p>八時，瞭望員發見敵機時，已聞蓬蓬之聲　同時並作，似萬雷齊鳴殺，向滑之路矗炸我機。不待彈落，即已昇空，可是遲了，敵康　里型十二架，戰鬥機三十架，已經遠飛逃走了。</p>
<p>八時四十分，因敵人業已逃走，正在萬分懊惱中，擬即降陸，地面來了「暫緩降陸」的信號。頓時舅氣百倍，嚴陣以待，但敵人不來，「不是一塲空歡喜嗎？」正在覺得疲倦而欲再降落時，又有「暫緩降落陸的」信號。「好的，此次一定是了」，嚴陣等待中，來了，來了，高度六千米，貝爾型及格拉曼型四十架以上，大隊而來。</p>
<p>敵方，我方同樣是戰鬥機，且貝爾，格拉曼都是勁敵。但究非對手，似飛燕般交戰三十分鐘，墜落了，墜落了，敵的半數以上，二十二架，跌落南海中，以果魚腹，此中奧村兵曹擊墜貝爾型二架，格拉曼型一架。</p>
<p>互相勉勵再行登記</p>
<p>我機〇〇架因燃料缺乏，不時降落基地，奧要緊了。戰友們互相勉　，騰躍登機。</p>
<p>地面上整備員們在叫君：「請勿飛至〇千米以上」，他們擔心沒有　素裏在這機囘答。在〇〇機上，昇至上空等　，啊！太多了，太多了，敵方的艦上轟炸機和戰鬥機蔽空而來，共計艦上轟炸機五十，戰門機六十，「很好，儘多儘少來吧」！</p>
<p>共計擊落五十四架我機〇〇架，突入數倍的敵人中間，當者披靡，墜下了。墜下的都是敵機。空戰三十分鐘後，擊落了艦上機五架，戰鬥落的，計艦上機一架，格拉曼型四架。</p>
<p>奧村上等飛行兵曹所保持的舉　記錄，計中國事變中四桀，大東亞載爭中加上了這天的十架共計四十架，合計五十四架。</p>
<p>司令說：</p>
<p>在長期間擊墜許多飛機的能錄很多，但一天中擊落十架的記錄尚是破天荒。在迸炎熱，惡疫的雨太平洋，行若無事，輿村兵曹們之旺盛的攻擊精神及强靭的體力，祇有敬服。每日每夜的航空決戰，都是這些年輕的空軍勇士們幹的。誠如山本元帥所說：「現在是年輕人的時代」，奧村兵曹的殊動，由於沉着果敢的性格，不斷的訓練，及屢次的實戰經騐所造成的。希望為空軍的勇士者，都有這種精神和體力。（翔：譯自十一月三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 祖仁</p>
<p>給機機榨盡精力，給生活吸與血汗——這就是勞工的意義：像夢。但是，卻不是夢，我向機械圈內討生活，已是六年了。</p>
<p>有機性人類的血肉和精力，配合着機械的原動力，缉合成了機械圈內的跳動，恕吼；我就在這每一分鐘都支配在跳動和怒吼裏的圈內，默默地生活着。</p>
<p>這裏的人類，把它們的體力和精神去統轉着機械的機能　使它能夠發揮出至高的生產教能。但是，機械也在把人類的血汗吸去供給它作機能的消耗——永是這般地循環着。每年，每月，每日，每時，沒有季節，也沒有氣候，不停止，也不變更，</p>
<p>一疋的呃布，就這樣地在機械上給產生了，但是：人的機能，是永遠追不上優良的機械的，於是　：活動在這圈裹的人，就一個個地瘦削了！</p>
<p>幹着這類消耗機械，也被機械消耗的工作的人類，就是所謂勞——一種出賣勞力的人。</p>
<p>這種出賣勞力人類，在我讀書的時代裹，對於它根本是生疏的，我不過是知道在世界上有着這一種的人類存在着吧！當然：在那時，我是完全將白己浸沉在求得學分的慾望裹的，對於這些命運異相於我們的人類的一切，是無暇去探討的，並且：那時的我決不會想到自己在以後，却會和這些我所忽略的人類。親切地在一起生活，並且；還悠久到有六年以上的歷史呢！</p>
<p>事實往往會使理想失望的！一些兒也不假，六年了，我生活在勞工羣裏。</p>
<p>每天，常電鐘的指針，指上七字的時候，兩　黑沉沉的工塲門裏，就吞進了一幫睡意未消的勞工羣，這時，就該開始出賣它們的勞力了，是的，一天的工作，又起始了呢……</p>
<p>跑進工塲，紗綻，織機，就在這一大羣勞工諳熱手法的管理下，發出重濁，粗營，單調的吼聲，這樣地，直待夜晚把黑暗推進工塲時，方才停止它的鬧囂。</p>
<p>都市裹的空氣，固然是惡濁的，但是；瞧一瞧工塲裹吧、歷粒，羊毛屑的飛舞，佈成了像晨間街頭薄霧，把陽光也給　糊了，勞工們就在這般惡濁的空氣裹，不知勞苦是什的空氣裏，不知勞苦是什麽的，埋頭工作着。</p>
<p>您說：在這般惡濁的空氣裏工作，對於「　養」是有着極端的妨碍吧！是的，新樣的空氣，是每一個有機性人類的必須品，雖然；這種營養的元素，是不用化錢去購買，就可以自由的享受，但是；在工塲裹，要享受新濟的空氣，卻是一種絕大的奢望呢：「營養」固然是需要，但是：對於一些飢餓的羣衆去談優異的「營養」，那何異於在　年時的一個皇帝，對那些飢餓的羣衆說，何不食肉糜，的一般不合情理。</p>
<p>是呀！空氣是決不會像麵包間題那般嚴重的，在一般勞工的心目中看來。否則；何以僅有增加工責的要求，而從沒有廳。過要求新鮮空氣的呼聲呢！</p>
<p>他們為着生活，就聲天的把自已的一切，都給支配在一種異樣的管理東縛裏，他們失卻了自主，生活，做了它們的主宰，他們追隨它，依從它：生活在使他們忘卻了勞苦和困乏。</p>
<p>瘦削了！病了！但是：生活却仍是嚴厲地在鞭策着它們，使它們不敢因此而停留一下喘息。它們給機械榨盡了精力，給生活吸收盡了血汗——六年勞工的意義。</p>
<p>人類榨盡了精力和汗血，去換取最低生活的酬報，這是一種悲慘的交易，但是；為着生存，我們可憐的勞工羣，就在這種交易方式裏喘息着：</p>
<p>普通貨品和擊值的交易，大致總是貨值和代價相埓的，但是呵！在我生活圈內，我見到的勞工羣，是誰也流盡血汗和精力的，但是；酬報呢！它們卻還不夠一家人的溫飽，我不相僧，人類的血肉和精力的代價，就是這般的低賤。</p>
<p>這種賤價出賣血汗和精力，是人間的悲劇，但是世界上這種的人類演出的悲劇，眞多着呢！</p>
<p>勞工，眞的是神聖的嗎！我時常在想。</p>
<h3 id="c35">桐葉 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 孫鐵城</p>
<p>庭中的桐葉又飄飄地墮落了，幾天來已積了厚厚底一層，孩子們都聚在半禿的梧桐榭下揀桐葉，據說葉柄是可以當墨用的。正閒着的我也想學着孩子們的玩意兒試試，才踏上枯黃的葉面；就發出一串刺耳而又帶些傷逝味兒的碎裂聲，頗使人想起當牠們壯年時，因被微風鼓動而　出壯麗熱情的靑春狂想曲時之盛況，可是現在靑春已成過去，狂想亦終於成為狂想而輕輕地被秋風吹散了；僅賸下凄凉而類絕的葬曲而已。再隔幾天就將默默地連一些聲息都沒有了，如非以前是特別偉大者，才也許會有孩子因見到牠葉柄的偉大，因而迫想到牠以前的偉大，而說聲「牠過去曾是張可驚的大葉子罷！」然而過去已是過去，現在呢？揀桐葉的確也是一椿很有趣的玩意兒；長得愈是粗壯，愈是好材料，也就是大家的目的物，要是有幾個孩子在同一時間發現一枝出類拔萃的大桐葉，那準會為了相同目標而起衝突的，這也是我所數見不　的事。</p>
<p>才揀了五六枝，却漸漸對於地上桐葉的顏色及蛀痕生了特別而且可笑的感想；灰色的是老死，理所當然，不必可惜。黃色的是「壯志未酬身先死」，未免可惜。綠色的是夭折，死得未免冤枉，也最是可惜。蛀痕更有趣了，也可以說更有意思，每張有每張的樣子，條條的蛀痕，象徽着牠過去的歷史：深·淺·　·狹·長·短，表示着牠號蛀的程度，關始蛀那裹，結果蛀那裹，為什麼蛀這張而不蛀那張，亦都有研究的價值。依我的叮笑的，孩子氣的觀察說；其被蛀的原因不外乎二點：一是弱小，一是壯大，由此可見孔老夫子之中席之道，的確有些這理，無怪乎夫子之導要被許多學者所死哨了。</p>
<p>揀了一會，手中已是滿滿一捱，內中有許多是曾被蟲蛀過的，猜想牠的一生，除發茅。生長。成熱，以至於蟲蛀，滅亡外；其他大概不會做過別的事，默默而生，默默而死，如此而已。</p>
<p>囘到書房內，將葉柄一根根都試騐，可是失絮得很，硯上的墨跡都擦下來了，仍是個沒成續，負氣將葉柄望實外就拋，並告訢孩子們不必再發小優勁了。但是有一個孩子卻高聲說「墨不可當，曬曬乾當　總可以。」於是他們仍舊秀高興的繼續工作下去，但不再是揀，而是亂搶了。</p>

<p>巨獸般伏在四周，我不會高喊：「沒有路啊！！沒有路啊！」我以為：亂石上還可以立脚；立了第一步脚，自然也可以立第二步。三步，四步步……</p>
<p>不就成了「走」麼？可以在上面走的，不是路，是什麼？×××固然沒有一條輕易地可走的路，連羊腸小道也不能看見。然而，終於是提起了我傷痕斑斑的脚在尖尖角角的亂石上，開始跨上了第一步……</p>

<h3 id="c37">足球聯賽甲組第一幕　評述警僑之戰　—一警有攻有守威風凜凜—　—僑聯突失常態一盤散沙— <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>上海足球聯賽甲組比賽，本定於前星期展開塲面，因而延期，上星期六日原有三塲比賽，不宰天不作美。日昨雨　終日，二塲精彩比養，又成因雨延期。所餘星期六一戰，一警輕取僑聯，竟以五對一之比大勝，出乎臆料之外。茲略記其戰况，並作評述兩隊球藝。</p>
<p>兩隊於（十三日）下午三時半會師於膠州公園，是日天雖晴好，而風勢甚大，不免影戰戰况，球迷因久無球看，欣然作壁上戰者，亦不下七百人，情况尙稱熱烈。</p>
<p>述戰况</p>
<p>時間旣屆，雙陣對圓，一警位南而順風，僑聯居北而逆，是以戰幕一啓，一警節節進攻，僑聯陣內，獨見警騎縱橫。兩內衛第於應付，卒不得免。在二十分鐘時爲黃毛首破綱角，以後一譬攻勢更盛，僑聯以以風逆不利，而全隊如一盤散沙，遑論取攻，上半時結束前十五分鐘時，黃毛再乘空打入一球。</p>
<p>休息再戰，僑聯雖得順風之助，仍見力不從心，一警健兄，尤戰尤勇，不久黃毛三中紅心。停聯諸將，相顧失色，困　之鬥，在所難免。法凡笑振臂一呼，全軍舊攻球勢一　。混戰良久，僑聯得罰角球之　會，右鋒操刀，一竟爾藉風勢一踢功成，對三，稍見起色。豈料好景遂此過去，眞是曇花一現，以後又爲警將世界，却倫茲夫射入於先，黃毛五對一定天下，一警先唱旋　。</p>
<p>評一警</p>
<p>全隊賴身體之健碩攻則視球之落點，五條急進，甚見銳快，煞是利害，　翼站立地位頗佳，盤勾均在水平綫上，射門則除黃毛外，尙見　弱，中衛綫上頗能退　守，進助攻，更以是戰僑聯兩　之軟，尤見活躍。而鐵伏尼之接腮前方看管法凡笑，為不可抹殺之人材，兩後衛羅塞爾氣足，地位甚佳，奔跑迅速。柯　脫似見生疏，　　時見，設若福恩出塲，則不免失　　見，論之似無聯誼李吳之老到，門將浮克尼表演較少</p>
<p>論個人，黃毛勞勃司脫夫之慄悍，不减三年前威風，其　進之快，難以捉摸，攻門之巧，尤爲守門所難守，唯其轉鈎方面，已無當年之活　矣。左　却倫茲夫似無袁錕田之猛，然其穩　，亦有過之之處，右翼　黎明短跑健將，盤傳殊見　度，惜少經騐，假以時　，不難成一員大將，餘子均在正常狀態中，不足多述矣。</p>
<p>論僑聯</p>
<p>聯之攻，採W式，過去頗有相當成就，猶憶聖芳濟與東華日三戰三和之風頭，去一福恩，多一法日笑，攻勢不可謂軟弱。唯斯戰演出大失常態。中鋒得球傳兩翼，兩翼均不能有所作爲，致兩內鋒徒勞往近，乃成功格格不八之態。中衛三將，尙能供給前方，看人亦見賣力。唯維克泰之無奈於黃毛耳，後衛係兩員老將，經騐頗足，其鑒於黃毛之怏，乃利用位於共前，使之越位。果然，引前鋒越位，戰策之一。黃毛於此戰之越位次數極多，然許。卡·則衛，竟不斷使用，　為致命傷，致球先到　毛　入，即有危險可能，誠不能隨機應變之缺點。門將　利　特，非上　之材，且大意應付。</p>
<p>個人而　，是戰最可取奢爲右前衛　而佛，滿塲飛奔，搶救有功，卡洛列區功多過少，不能以勝敗而歸罪也。前鋒五將一無可取，法凡笑果然對方看煞，然得球之後，傳交兩翼，終成盡　，孤　難嗚，英雄　短，徒見其徬徨塲中耳。右弱勃拉格經騐缺少，動作遲滯，易以福恩至少有二次機會可以一穩取空門，奈勃拉格之無用乎？其角球之直入網門，打破鴨蛋，亦足以略减其罪耶？左翼卡潑司汀。亦見慢笨與中路不能呼應，要亦大失常態後之現象。（梅必賢）</p>
<h3 id="c38">乒乓練習方法　給初學者一個門徑 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>欲求大衆都有康健的身體，就非得注重體育不可，所以提倡體育就是使身體健康的最重要的條件之一。吾人的身體運用次數愈多，就愈加發　，但有些運動，每使身體畸形的發遠。而乒乓扣是全身平均發”的運動，不但全身運　平均，同樣還需要「轉念頭」，也是手腦並用的運動，所以就格外値得我們提倡。</p>
<p>知道運動的重要，每能作初步的嘗試，然而能夠　　的，就不很多，推敲其　，大槪是因爲不能懂得　動的方法，得不到運　的眞實趣味。有的是不能遵守運動規則，與衆共　　一逢塲作戲一，可說於身體的康　，無濟於事的。所以我們提倡兵乓遝動是很重要。而切實的研究「乒乓術」，使初學者得一敲門磚，熟練者多得切磋的機會，是格外的　要。</p>
<p>攻守之道</p>
<p>「乒乓術」因爲平日一談起的人很少，眞　像一部二十四史　從何說起。筆者不才，就我十餘年夾研究乒乓的方法，寫一些在下面，以供各界同志的參考。</p>
<p>拍乒乓的方法很多，但大別有二種：一種是「檔」一削　的守球·另一　是「抽」「壓」的攻球，初練習的人，先要把守做基礎，就是和人比賽一也要先守，保持不輸，然後　　機會，加以攻擊。</p>
<p>守的方法很多，最初要初「近擋球」，不論　方的球是　擋重擊，在練習的人當要把最忠實的　度囘擊，只求多打幾次，延長練　的機會，這　用心的練習，經過着干時間以後，　騐漸多，球性　然，無論何種硬球，都有趁勢應接的能力，然後再練習「遠擋球」『削球。各種手法練　了，再進一步練習「輕抽」。這種「輕抽一雖然沒有多大力量，但比較一削」來得有力，可以防止對方的猛攻或是凶削並且可以使來球不準不硬，「輕抽」至練習有相當的把握以後，再在準的條件之下，逐漸加重抽的力量，達到猛攻硬敲的她步。</p>
<p>「近擋」種「削球」的基本，「經抽」是「猛攻」的某礎，所以練球先要練守，要守先要練習「近擋」「遠擋」「削球」練好後，才好進一步練習「輕抽」「猛攻」。這種卞法，好像造房子先打宅脚。根深蒂固。危險自然很少了。</p>
<p>三個時期</p>
<p>習乒乓從過程上說，可以分爲三個時期。每一時期都不着應該努力練習的目標。</p>
<p>初學時期　要把全　精神集中在球的一點上。　爲球在檯上跳動的位置，球速、軟球在拍的時候，着　　比着樣後約快二分之一　，球的轉動速度，球的同　方向等，在球着檯以後，可以時得　行的方向。同時要注意還擊出去的球，打在球拍的中部，打球在拍的中部是很困雖的。但球拍的中部反　最强。並且各種打法也可以正確。球拍的西邊反　力减少，而運用各　拍法，也很少把握，所以在初學時　要密切注意着球，同時要注意　出的球館　打在球拍的中部。</p>
<p>在這一個時期，不宜模仿熟練的乒乓家打球，而濫打硬球，要留心不觸網，不出檯；充分的約束着球。把球打在底綫的一尺以內，並且要先練習　拍的手在自已身體前貨的拍法。再次　習執拍的手曳向後的拍法，到　兩種拍法學會了，才好練習旁敬側　，</p>
<p>在每還拍一記球以後　刻刻準備着還拍下一記來球，因爲刻刻準備，方能隨時應付，否則會遭意外的襲擊，而束手無策的</p>
<p>能把打出的球差不多可以記記打在拍的中部，記記可以打在對方的檯而上以後，才好算完畢第一期課程。</p>
<p>訓練時期　在這一時期，應該注意矯正自己的弱點，練習各種拍法。自己少一種拍法，是多一個破靛，對方多一個　　機會，並且遠要會得節省體力，應該攻的時候才攻，應該守的時候是守，不朵守，不妄動。敏捷　付，以爲長久的戰鬭。</p>
<p>除此以外。還要留心對手的動作，因爲明白對手的動作，可以預知對方還球的方向，觀察的方法大約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，打球　几打球時的腕、拍，身體的姿勢等；</p>
<p>二，彼我的位置及打球姿勢；</p>
<p>三，對方與乒乓檯的一位置；</p>
<p>四，球拍的位置，</p>
<p>五，對方的癖好及常用策略的研究。</p>
<p>能夠注意上面的幾點，那麼對方拍出怎樣的球，是不難預測的。</p>
<p>在這一　期不　要　正自已的弱點。練習各種拍法。注意對方的動作，同時還要訓練自巳的手和脚，　練自已的手是項重要的事。但在拍的時俠，要是脚不活　的幫忙，是不成功的。應付對方任回方向的攻擊，一定要有隨機　變的處置，這種而面顧到的身手，是有賴於脚的活動的，</p>
<p>熟練時期　對打球的原理應該已經十分領曾，球也打得很好了。各種通常的動作也已經看慣了，所以在這個時期的乒乓家眼睛是平看的，要多作敵前的觀察，做自己還球的最後修正。</p>
<p>眼是心的代表，在熟練的乒乓家，不注意看球，而把眼睛測着對方的檯面，決定自己還擊的方向，所以熟練的兵乓家，很多觀察對方的眼睛而判斷對方還球的方向的，不過這種決定，也容易往往上當的，有些人把眼光注神着某方向，但把球向反對方向打去。這種打法很容易使對方迷惑，　法應付的。</p>
<p>拍乒乓並沒有一定不易的方法，全在各人的活用，全　熱中　巧。譬如抽球與壓球尖急而平穩的，　效往往並不很大，要是抽球帶轉，壓球帶削，　麼囘擊的人在應付你的球勢的尖急以外，還得仔細觀察球的方向，因爲轉球着檯卽後，進行方向不一定會和未着檯以前一　，削球更如輕飄如飛，使人捉摸不定。</p>
<p>總之，乒乓雖小道，其興趣與奧妙、實　窮盡，有的時候竟不是筆墨所能　會於萬一，全在自己的體會了。（完）陳霖笙</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Health and Hygiene Administration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The first National Health Administration Conference will be held in the capital today. The purpose of the Health Administration Conference is undoubtedly to strengthen the effectiveness of health administration, expand public health, and thereby promote national health. In our editorial on the 9th, we suggested that those guiding youth movements should first emphasize physical fitness training for young people. This is because the achievement of personal academic and professional pursuits depends on energy, and energy depends on a strong physique. If one's physique is weak and energy depleted, even with a wealth of knowledge, one will inevitably find it difficult to exert oneself fully and be of use to society, which is regrettable! This applies to individuals, and even more so to society and the nation. Therefore, the relationship between national health and national endeavors is extremely close and significant!</p>
<p>The promotion of national health lies in actively exercising and building physical strength to resist diseases, and passively adhering to hygiene to prevent diseases. Exercise and hygiene are equally important and should be carried out simultaneously without neglecting either. Exercise includes physical activities like sports. Hygiene, on the other hand, has a broader scope, involving clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all aspects of life. In short, hygiene is rationalized living. For example, clothing should be adjusted to suit the weather, eating and drinking should be moderate, living spaces should have good ventilation, and walking should be steady and safe. The principles are simple, but they are essential to health.</p>
<p>Personal hygiene is important, but public health is even more important. Public health is closely related to the public and is a social undertaking. Because it is a social undertaking, it is inseparable from the social environment and social organization. For example, epidemic prevention is a matter of public health. In a society where health knowledge is widespread, the public will automatically request or accept vaccinations, or comply with guidelines to eradicate disease-causing organisms upon a public announcement. However, in a society where health knowledge has not been widely disseminated, even with repeated persuasion, people will disregard it, and it cannot be implemented without forceful intervention. This can be seen in the municipal health authorities' annual summer vaccination measures. This means that in Chinese society, public health knowledge has not been widely disseminated, which hinders the implementation of public health measures. Therefore, we hope that health authorities will recognize and grasp this point, and constantly promote public health knowledge, especially in public places. At the same time, strengthen public health education and guidance in schools, in order to fundamentally popularize national health knowledge.</p>
<p>Health administration is the engine for promoting public health. Whether or not the measures are appropriate is critical to the future of public health. The most important principle of administration is to understand the social environment, assess needs, consider economic conditions, and one's own capabilities to determine an administrative plan that suits the current situation. Of course, a health administration plan should not simply cater to social realities without regard for theory. However, blindly emphasizing theory and copying administrative plans that are suited to different social environments is also completely unfeasible. For example, in the current wartime state, prices are high, and most people can barely afford coarse grains and vegetables. Yet, based on nutritional principles, promoting milk and bread would be an example of not fitting the social environment. Furthermore, we know that the implementation of any administrative plan requires talent and funding, and health administration is no exception. In this regard, we hope that the health authorities will be more mindful of reality and not seek quick success. It is better to decide on a practical and easily implementable ordinary plan and make it happen, make it effective, and gradually expand it. A plan based on profound theories and lofty goals, in the face of the current lack of talent and funding, is better not proposed if it cannot be realized.</p>
<p>The Health Administration Conference is just as important as other political and economic conferences. Our suggestions above, although not detailed proposals, are intended to emphasize this principle to the health authorities. The future of public health and the future of national health are at stake!</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Military Achieves Glorious Victory in Four Naval and Air Battles off Bougainville Island; Three Enemy Ships Sunk, Two Heavily Damaged <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 14th. On the dawn of the 13th, Japanese naval air units fiercely attacked enemy mobile units in the sea south of Bougainville Island, achieving the following results: Sinking one enemy large cruiser, one cruiser, damaging one destroyer, severely damaging one enemy battleship, and one medium-sized aircraft carrier. Two Japanese aircraft failed to return. Note: This air battle is known as the Fourth Naval Air Battle off Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 14th the glorious results of the Fourth Naval Air Battle off Bougainville Island. According to military experts here, the enemy fleet has repeatedly suffered defeats and heavy losses, and appears to be on the verge of collapse and retreat. At dawn on the 13th, a powerful enemy fleet with battleships, aircraft carriers, and destroyers was indirectly escorting a transport convoy and advancing north in the waters southwest of Bougainville Island. Upon discovering this powerful enemy fleet, the Japanese naval attack aircraft immediately launched an attack at around 3:00 AM, with torpedo bombers as the main force. They quickly flew over the enemy fleet, braving intense anti-aircraft fire to launch torpedoes, sinking one large cruiser, one cruiser, and one destroyer, achieving tremendous results. They then pursued the remaining enemy ships attempting to escape, and severely damaged one enemy battleship and one medium-sized aircraft carrier. Smoke was seen coming from the stern deck of the aircraft carrier, so it could not be confirmed that it had been sunk, but it is believed to have sunk. In this battle, the Japanese also lost two aircraft. The enemy attempted to supply the landing forces at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island, land subsequent troops, and destroy the Japanese air force at Rabaul, a strategic stronghold on the front line in the south. The enemy's attempts were thwarted by the Japanese military and met with four fierce counterattacks. Although it is extremely difficult to launch fighter planes at night, the Japanese naval aircraft, who had undergone intensive training, were able to overcome these difficulties and achieve this great victory with their courageous spirit and superb skills.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Aircraft Surprise Attacks in New Guinea and Burma</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:38 PM on the 14th: In New Guinea, Japanese army air units continuously attacked enemy airfields such as Machabu and Tenbi in the Ramu River and Megam River basins for four days from November 6th to 9th, and cooperated with ground units to intercept enemy aircraft, achieving the following results (including the results announced on November 8th): 59 enemy aircraft shot down (17 unconfirmed), and more than 120 enemy aircraft destroyed or set on fire on the ground. The Japanese side suffered 15 aircraft lost or failed to return. In Burma, Japanese army air units bombed enemy airfields in Imphal, India, and other places in eastern India on the 9th and 11th, achieving the following results: more than 33 enemy aircraft destroyed or set on fire on the ground, and three enemy fuel storage sites were hit and caught fire. The Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Argentine Central News Agency from Kyoto, 14th - According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy Department announced on the 13th that Japanese air squadrons had bombed anti-Axis bases on the Ellice Islands and Noumea in the Pacific on the night of the 11th, causing damage to anti-Axis personnel and facilities.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Torpedo Squadron Achieves Unprecedented Victory in Naval Warfare History <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese torpedo aircraft squadrons have recently achieved astonishing results in the waters off Bougainville Island since the attack on Pearl Harbor. In two air battles, they sank four enemy battleships, two aircraft carriers, and nineteen ships, and destroyed eleven enemy cruisers and other ships. This is an unprecedented victory in the history of naval warfare, proving the excellence of Japanese torpedo squadron technology. Torpedo aircraft are single-engine aircraft that carry aerial torpedoes under their wings to attack enemy battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships. However, torpedoes must be launched while skimming the surface of the sea and approaching the enemy ship. These attacking torpedo aircraft carry only one torpedo, and must release it at low altitude, as dropping it from high altitude will cause it to explode on the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in addition to ensuring a direct hit when launching a torpedo, excellent skill is required, venturing into life and death to sink an enemy aircraft carrier. Often, it is necessary to first engage with the enemy's escorting aircraft and shoot them down, and then be bombarded by the enemy's destroyers, followed by bombardment from enemy cruisers, before finally being able to attack the enemy aircraft carrier. At that time, it is even more necessary to overcome the ship's defenses, cannon fire, and the aircraft directly protecting the ship. If the target is a battleship, it will inevitably be bombarded by the enemy ship's flat-trajectory guns. Even if it is not hit by shells, it will touch water mines and explode, or be subjected to intense attacks from enemy anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. After passing through these difficulties, it is even more necessary to carefully launch the torpedo to complete the mission of sinking the enemy ship. From the above, it can be seen that sinking a battleship or an aircraft carrier is extremely difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e4">National Health Administration Conference Opens in the Capital This Morning; Over 100 Proposals Received <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The First National Health Administration Conference convened by the Ministry of Health has been in preparation and is now ready. It is specifically scheduled to grandly open at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association today (the 15th). Representatives from various regions have arrived in the capital one after another, and more than one hundred proposals have been received. The chairman of the conference is Lu Runzhi, Minister of Health, and the secretary-general is Lin Peng, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health. It is scheduled that before the meeting today at 8:30 AM, the chairman will lead all attendees and observers to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects, and then hold a meeting at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to strengthen the health administration structure, understand the status of health facilities in various regions, and discuss various improvement plans, the Ministry of Health decided to convene the first National Health Administration Conference, inviting the heads of health departments in various provinces and cities, as well as health personnel from various regions. Since the national government returned to Nanjing, a separate health administration organization has not been established, and only a Department of Health was set up within the Ministry of Interior to handle health affairs. Later, the national government authorities, recognizing that health administration has a profound and significant impact on national health, and that it would be insufficient to establish an organization to promote it effectively, decided in April of this year to establish a separate Ministry of Health to restore the pre-war system. Subsequently, the relevant parties formulated organizational rules and actively prepared, and health administration has since gained further development. In June, the Executive Yuan meeting resolved to approve the special appointment of Lu Runzhi as Minister of Health. Since taking office, Lu has actively worked to promote national health administration affairs. At the same time, the Ministry conducted phased inspection plans to various parts of the country to understand the status of health facilities in various regions, as reference to promote the nation wide health administration. The areas inspected included Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and North China. While in North China, Lu also participated in the North China Medical Association meeting. After several consultations, the North China Medical Association decided to dissolve and change to the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association. By this point, the national health administration structure was unified. And at this time, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just been signed and our country is completely independent and autonomous, in order to share the responsibilities of the Great East Asia War and construction, it is especially necessary to have a strong physique. Therefore, the convening of this Health Administration Conference is of great significance. The scope of the conference includes health administration, medical management, public health, health education, disease prevention, health insurance, travel hygiene, and health statistics, but it emphasizes administrative structure and efficiency. Disease prevention and the training of health personnel are emphasized to unify and promote national health administration and ensure national health. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to and expect this conference. It is expected that after the completion of the conference, national health administration will have a landmark advancement, and it will also make a great contribution to national health.</p>

The Philippines has now gloriously achieved independence, and the opportunity for India's independence has also arrived. However, since the 400 million people of India have not yet been liberated, if this good opportunity for independence is missed, the liberation of all of Asia will be difficult to achieve. Indian youth, quickly take up arms and go to the battlefield to defeat your old enemies, Britain and the United States, and fight for the liberation and revival of all of Asia, and for the liberation of India. Representatives of youth groups from China, Japan, and Manchukuo gathered in Tokyo to hold the Great East Asia Youth Leaders' Conference. At this time when the youth of Great East Asia are becoming more united, on behalf of the general will of the youth of the three countries, we hope that all the youth of India will rise up together. We will move forward to achieve our common goal.</p>

<p>Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to the latest news received here: Indian troops have surrounded Beirut, preparing to disarm the Senegalese indigenous troops of the French army and take over Lebanon. The means taken by the British in the Lebanese incident have become increasingly clear, so it is believed here that the French High Commissioner, Helu Shi, has no hope of resisting the British measures. The Near East Wireless Station, managed by the British, has become increasingly blatant in its accusations against the French authorities in Lebanon. The Turkish side believes that the background to the Lebanese incident is the British intention to drive the French out of the Near East.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Beirut, the Lebanese crisis has turned into an international one, as it is rumored that the public has demanded that Britain and the United States intervene based on the Atlantic Charter. Britain's situation is quite difficult. If it protects Lebanon, it will offend the French Committee. If it maintains neutrality and cooperates with the French, it will arouse the anger of all Arabs.</p>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to news received here: The Senegalese troops in Lebanon began to have serious clashes with British troops yesterday. It is said that the fighting occurred because British troops attempted to disarm the Senegalese indigenous troops patrolling the duties. The British Minister to Beirut, Spibia, had a third meeting with the High Commissioner of the French Government in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo: The vice president of the Lebanese provisional government is French and the state coordinator is Dutch. The temporary government is located in Barjik, fifty kilometers away from Beirut, and all cabinet members who have not been arrested are serving in the temporary government.</p>
<p>Conflicts Continue Between Locals and French Troops</p>
<p>Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Beirut dispatch: The conflict between Lebanese locals and French rebels has gradually intensified, resulting in many deaths. It is also rumored that French rebels have occupied important streets in Tripoli, and the residences of Lebanese citizens have been looted or burned by rioters. It is believed that the Lebanese Minister of Defense, who was previously denounced by puppet officials of the French regime, commanded these rioters. It is also rumored that some Lebanese Christians, who have always hated the brutality of the French rebels, have risen up to clash with them.</p>
<p>Iraqi and Syrian Governments Decide to Provide Support</p>
<p>Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to the official gazette published in Baghdad yesterday, the Iraqi government has instructed its acting minister to Syria to immediately meet with Lebanese leaders and other government officials, stating that Iraq will do its utmost to rebuild the Lebanese constitution.

<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines has been established for nearly a month, and the foundation and security of the new country are becoming more solid. Overseas Chinese Xian Yanquan was sent to the Philippines by the Kuomintang before the war to promote resistance against Japan. He served as the propaganda minister of the Philippine branch of the Chongqing Kuomintang. Recently, he realized his past mistakes. He was deeply moved by Japan's new policies towards China and the lofty ideals of the Great East Asia Joint Declaration. He fled from Mount Samilkir in Bulacan Province to Manila on the 8th of last month and surrendered to the Japanese military police in the Philippines, cooperating in the construction of the New Philippines and the revival of East Asia, and was given a path to self-renewal. After regaining his freedom, Zeng expressed to people that he had misunderstood the Great East Asia War in the past. Recently, he had discovered Japanese policies towards China and the ideals of the Great East Asia Joint Declaration in Chinese newspapers in Manila, and realized the path that East Asian nations should take. All Chinese people should work together to realize Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Great Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Fierce Fighting Continues at Fortress West of Kyiv; 30 Soviet Divisions Concentrated on the Southern Flank <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Kyiv, Chernigov, and Gomel areas. However, a major battle seems to be brewing in Krivoy Rog, as German intelligence has discovered that the Soviets have concentrated thirty divisions of troops there. The Soviets clearly intend to reinforce the central forces west of Kyiv, and also want to push their flanks westward, presumably because the Soviets fear their flanks are threatened. Soviet troops west of Kyiv are currently continuing to exert pressure on the Zhytomyr area, with fierce fighting taking place. There is also fierce fighting northwest of Kyiv. Soviet attacks on the south and southwest of the city have been repulsed, and German counterattacks have recaptured important positions. The Soviet attacks northwest of Krivoy Rog and north of Kremenchuk and Cherkasy the day before were aimed at pushing through their flanks, but the Soviet attacks on the north of Kremenchuk and Cherkasy have been halted. Soviet attacks north west of Chernigov have been renewed, but the battle situation has not changed significantly. Soviet attacks north of Gomel and north of Smolensk have been repulsed, and German counterattacks in the Nevel area are progressing smoothly. There is no change in the battle situation on the Crimean Peninsula.

<h3 id="e12">Preventing Hoarding of Goods; Strictly Prohibiting Resale; Businesses Must Issue Transaction Receipts When Closing a Deal <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Various municipal authorities in this city have never relaxed their efforts in managing prices. The price limits for standard goods that have been set in the past will continue to be enforced, and no one will be allowed to profit excessively. At the same time, efforts are being made to actively dredge the sources of materials and raw materials from various regions. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned from various trade associations that the authorities are paying close attention to the daily transactions of merchants. For any type of commodity supplied by a customer to a trading house, the trading house must sell the item to a firm that deals in such goods, and then the firm must display it in the bustling city for legitimate users to purchase. Resale is strictly prohibited. If trading houses trade with each other, or firms buy and sell from each other, there will be many layers of resale, which easily leads to adverse phenomena such as hoarding, speculation, and monopoly. On the one hand, they profit from each other, invisibly increasing the buyer's cost and raising market prices. Therefore, in order to thoroughly eliminate such illegal transactions, all trading houses, firms, and customers must set a price and officially close the deal for all goods sold or purchased. Both the buyer and seller must issue transaction receipts. The receipt should state the names of the firm, company, or factory of both parties, the name and quantity of the goods, the price, the date of the transaction, and the name of the person in charge. Each party should hold one copy, for future inspection. At the same time, when purchasing these goods, the buyer must ship the goods to the designated warehouse or cargo wharf within the stipulated time, without any deliberate delay or excuse. Once the deadline is exceeded, the seller can freely sell the goods to other parties, and the original buyer cannot stop it, but the payment may not be given, in order to distinguish between right and wrong, and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Ideal Children's Band of Misery <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Men</p>
<p>Rationalized Living</p>
<p>The residents of the orphanage live a rationalized life. Regarding their sustenance, Director Yao said, "In general children's welfare institutions, due to economic difficulties, they often cannot meet the standard material life of children. Our institution also has this extreme hardship. To keep children with a below-standard material life healthy, we absolutely use scientific methods for the management of clothing, food, and housing to strive for effectiveness. We also train children to use both their hands and minds, strengthen their bodies, and save expenses." As he spoke, he took the reporter to visit the kitchen. The first impression was its cleanliness and orderliness. Several girls were washing dishes and tidying up the fuel. A boy was busy by the noodle-cutting machine, preparing dinner. One could not tell that he was actually a little technician, not only able to make noodles but also able to repair machinery! Like a miniature Liangshan Marsh, this place has children from all social classes and various talented children with specialized skills!</p>
<p>The complex work of the residents' clothing, food, housing, and various other aspects is all under the leadership of the Child Welfare Service Corps, operated individually or collectively by the children. Even the infant department does not hire nannies, but only trains older girls to serve as little nannies, in order to develop the children's spirit of friendship. Even public affairs such as message delivery are entirely handled by the children. Therefore, the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute can be said to be the only children's welfare institution in Shanghai that does not employ laborers, thoroughly implements self-governance, and achieves ideal results.</p>
<p>In terms of diet, the entire responsibility lies with the Dietary Department of the Child Welfare Service Corps, which is divided into four sections. The cooking section is responsible for allocating kitchen staff and researching and guiding cooking methods. The accounting section manages petty cash accounts. The purchasing section goes to the vegetable market with teachers every day to buy vegetables. The storage section stores all rice, flour, oil, salt, fuel, and dining utensils. Currently, this department is also under the guidance of Ms. Wang Qing, a nursing staff member.</p>
<p>The third and fourth floors are the residents' dormitories. Most of the rooms are girls' bedrooms, while the boys' bedrooms only occupy a small portion. In each bedroom, there are only double-decker iron beds, all with white cloth sheets. Each person has a quilt and other bedding items. Bedroom cleanliness competitions are held regularly, so each person's bedroom door is adorned with a brightly colored ranking tag. Especially the cleanliness trophy hangs high, a source of great joy. Of course, boys seem to have little chance of winning the trophy.</p>
<p>Hygiene work is as valued as academics in the Child Welfare Education Institute. In terms of personal hygiene, the personal hygiene section of the Child Welfare Service Corps checks personal hygiene every day according to the hygiene creeds promulgated by the Ministry of Health. In terms of public hygiene, the public hygiene section is responsible for cleaning each venue twice a day, assigned by children by district. The section sends people to inspect the cleanliness of each venue every day and awards prizes for the competition.</p>
<p>The Service Corps has a medical section and a sickness reporting section. The former manages medicines and implements the ordinary treatments prescribed by doctors, while the latter takes care of patients, manages the sickroom, and performs ordinary nursing duties. All of these are guided by the care department, with staff responsible for guiding the residents in providing voluntary services.</p>
<p>They pay special attention to disease prevention, administering various vaccinations, cultivating hygiene habits, and paying attention to physical examinations. Nurse Li Shuying conducts a general check-up once a month, and a doctor is specially invited to conduct a detailed examination once or twice a year. If a sick resident is found, mild cases stay in the institute's special infirmary, cared for by the resident nurse, while severe cases are sent to epidemic hospitals, Guangci Hospital, Shanghai Children's Hospital, etc., where free medical treatment is available. The benevolent spirit of these hospitals is truly worthy of respect.</p>
<p>The Place Where Destiny is Transformed</p>
<p>Is there really such a thing as destiny?</p>
<p>However, at the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, facts are used to answer: Even if there is such a thing as "destiny," it can be transformed! Look! Those whom they take in and educate are all miserable children from various regions and social classes, without clothing or food, and thin and sick, almost unidentifiable as humans! Here are child brides and maids under the whip of hardship and suffering, here are street children, here are pitiful abducted children and lost children, here are orphans who have lost their parents and have no one to rely on, here are child refugees who have fled to Shanghai due to water and drought disasters, here are unfortunates who have lost everything due to the ravages of war, here are poor children whose families are too impoverished to raise and educate them, here are pitiful children abandoned by dysfunctional families, and here are even young offenders who have committed "crimes" out of necessity… Among them, maids and child refugees affected by the war are the most numerous. These miserable boys and girls, some as young as five or six, others as old as eleven or twelve, are all unfortunate children of school age, and some maids are even older, up to sixteen or seventeen.</p>
<p>Through the relief and education of the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, they have all become neat, clean, healthy, and lively good children. The painful and hopeless imprints of their old lives of cruelty and inhumanity have quietly disappeared from their little hearts. Many of them have found new outlets upon leaving the institute. Some have found their way back to their hometowns, reuniting with their families. Some have found new homes, being adopted as sons and daughters. Some have embarked on the road to self-reliance, working in factories, shops, hospitals, and on the railway.</p>
<p>When the girls grow up, if young men from outside with clean families, sound character, and legitimate occupations seek to marry them, and the girls agree, a wedding can be held on their behalf according to certain procedures. Look! Isn't the reception room full of commemorative photos of residents holding weddings? Director Yao already has many "adopted sons-in-law"!</p>
<p>Director Yao said that the children taken in and educated by the institute, whether they return to their hometowns, are adopted and find new homes, are helped to find spouses, or are helped to find jobs and serve in society, all first undergo thorough investigation and careful study. Everything is done with a solemn attitude, and strict procedures must be followed in implementation. After leaving the institute, the institute continues to assume the responsibility of protection. Whether the residents return to their hometowns or find new homes, they must still come to the institute from time to time, and the institute often visits to maintain contact. Even the married girls are concerned about like mothers caring for their daughters, and are even welcome to bring their new husbands and children to linger at the institute. The care for the institute's residents serving in society goes without saying.</p>
<p>Further education is also one of the main outlets for the residents of the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute. Those who are suitable for academic advancement in terms of aptitude and character are fully assisted in their further education to seek advanced studies. It is said that there have been seven graduating classes from the Child Welfare Elementary School, totaling more than sixty students. Among them, twenty-five have continued their studies with the full assistance of the institute, having completed high school and junior high school programs. They are top students in various famous middle schools in Shanghai, which can be said to be a breath of fresh air for the unfortunate children.</p>
<p>When they enter the institute, they are miserable children without food or clothing, thin and sick, seemingly without human form. But when they leave the institute, they are all healthy, sensible, energetic, and ambitious new youths!</p>
<p>For the future of the Chinese nation, may everyone bless this ideal children's paradise of misery! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Proposal to Levy an Education Surtax <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yunying</p>
<p>The impoverished lives of educational workers are a well-known fact. If the authorities want to effectively provide relief, they must open up a fixed source of funds, and the author believes that levying an education surtax is one way to do it.</p>
<p>The collection of an education surtax was previously implemented by some county education bureaus in Jiangsu Province. Given the current tight financial situation of the municipal government, it may be worthwhile to implement it to provide relief for educational workers. The author believes that the targets of the levy can be all kinds of consumables, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, luxury goods, etc., as well as all entertainment venues, where an additional 5% or 10% surtax can be levied on tickets. Those who enjoy these things will certainly not feel that this little surtax is too harsh, while educational workers can use this considerable income to subsidize their lives and stabilize their livelihood.</p>
<p>As for the large donations initiated by social figures to relieve the lives of educational workers, and the 500,000 yuan subsidy provided by the education authorities to supplement educational workers, these are just drops in the bucket and not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Levying an education surtax to increase the salaries of educational workers will stabilize the lives of educational workers, and the problem of the authorities raising large sums of money can also be solved. Why not do it, killing two birds with one stone! (Moved by Assistance for Education)</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Livelihood Problems of Baojia Officials <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Beibei</p>
<p>Now that the administration of Shanghai is gradually becoming unified, the Baojia organization urgently needs to be improved in order to assist in the advancement of government affairs and make up for the shortcomings of the police force. Recently, the Ministry of the Interior issued an order that local Baojia committees are responsible for supervising and guiding mass movements in the future. The deployment of Baojia work is also becoming increasingly important, and while personnel adjustments and ability evaluations for Baojia officials, who are key cadres, are certainly essential, improving their livelihood is also a matter of urgency. As the saying goes, "Only with a stable life can there be stable work." If we want to increase work efficiency, the self-motivation of local officials, and the training of "spiritual life" are certainly the most important. However, ensuring a reasonable level of "material life" so that they can work with peace of mind and fulfill their duties is the second most important thing. Otherwise, their spirit and energy will be diverted from service to the pursuit of food and clothing, and it will be difficult to achieve good results in increasing work efficiency. Furthermore, if those in difficult circumstances are forced to use their positions for personal gain, it will be difficult to avoid. In essence, this is an abnormal phenomenon caused by an unbalanced social system!</p>
<p>The development of any undertaking—and Baojia is certainly a social undertaking—requires good cadres. Cultivating good cadres is not easy under normal circumstances. In this extraordinary period, there must be timely plans and practices in both guidance and work. The increasingly severe livelihood problems that are forming today affect everyone's hearts—especially those of low-level cadres, such as elementary school teachers, junior civil servants, and Baojia officials. They are almost constantly suffering from the hardships of life, which increases the pain of their work and reduces their energy for the undertaking.</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that a sound Baojia system can directly and indirectly assist in the sound governance of Shanghai. Improving the living standards of Baojia officials so that they can fulfill their duties is a key strategy for a sound Baojia system. As a citizen, I express my infinite sympathy for the serious livelihood problems of Baojia officials who work tirelessly for the public every day. I have written these "petition-like" words, appealing to the enlightened Baojia authorities, hoping to arouse a motion for relief.</p>

<p>Paper and raw materials for paper have a great relationship to culture, so in order to adapt to the wartime system and save unnecessary consumption, it is necessary to control them. The establishment of the Central China Paper Industry Control Association (tentative name) is to concentrate paper and then meticulously allocate it. In order to further establish the control mechanism, the Control Association is adjusting related parts and investigating the current situation of the paper industry in Central China. According to the recent paper consumption in the Central China region, except for the Wuhan area, about 60,000 to 70,000 tons are needed, but the production volume is only 50%. The Japanese paper mill produces 3,700 to 3,800 tons, and the Chinese paper mill produces 2,700 to 2,800 tons, so the production department needs to be encouraged and promoted. According to Japanese newspapers, paper mills in Central China are now actively increasing production. Tianzhang Paper Mill pays great attention to printing paper. Jiangnan Paper Mill has begun to make paper with reed poles, and the results are quite satisfactory. China Paper Mill is increasing capital. Other Shanghai paper mills, Hualun Paper Mill, etc. are stepping up their efforts to make paper in Central China self-sufficient.</p>

<p>The market conditions of various industries in this city are still quite stable, and the overall financial situation has not changed significantly. However, credit is tighter. Fortunately, the Central Reserve Bank has properly allocated it, and it has gradually become active. According to reporters' inquiries yesterday, a small number of merchants in this city have engaged in speculative transactions in a single-minded way. Although they have made a lot of profit, the authorities have not relaxed their management of prices. Therefore, some merchants have suffered serious threats, and recently they have found it difficult to operate and have changed hands. Or they have changed to other industries, but their daily transactions are still very light, and there is a lack of people asking about all spot goods. As for industry, there is not much progress. However, small-scale production is very active. For the sake of smooth promotion, they have posted announcements to recruit skilled male and female workers. As for the raw materials needed to make goods, they are purchased sporadically, or they are automatically purchased from the production area and applied here. It is said that the authorities pay close attention to these small factories and will find ways to assist them to make high-quality products and increase the bargaining chips for the supply of goods on the market.</p>
<p>Financial Stability Last Week, Daily Necessities Stopped Rising and Turned Flat</p>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable last week. Finance was stable, and commodity prices fell to normal on a daily basis. Especially after the Hua Merchants Securities Exchange officially resumed trading, the market saw a prosperous scene. In terms of finance, the posted prices of pure silver and customs gold were still fixed and rarely changed. Because the market's need for funds was relatively strong, credit was slightly tight. The interbank interest rate was listed at 17% last week. The rice industry unified drama will actively buy rice and grain, and is expected to fully distribute it at a lower price. Daily food is also gradually implementing the cooperation system, and the market price has stopped rising and turned flat.</p>

<p>Fu Hong The goods arrived before and after were gradually increasing, which was not very suitable for sales, resulting in a sharp drop in market prices, not only unable to guarantee capital, but also wasting money. Therefore, the area is rare, and the price is relaxed. However, the weather is getting colder now, and the identity is drier than before.</p>
<p>Dried persimmons After seeing the new products in the production area, the price has risen sharply. The degree of increase has doubled since the beginning of the market. Because there are too many defenders, it has created a situation of frequent mistakes. Although there are a few shipments here, they have not yet arrived. It is expected that they will be listed soon.</p>
<p>Black melon seeds In the past, there were very few goods received, and the market price did not rise. However, they have gradually arrived, and there is no shortage. The price has returned to normal. The price of small and medium grains has dropped by about 10%. It is said that the production price has also dropped slightly.</p>

<p>This is Sergeant Satoshi Anabuki's magnificent air combat diary. He is a brave warrior from the Youth Aviation Corps. On October 8th, over the Bay of Bengal, he single-handedly challenged thirteen enemy aircraft, including new enemy fighter and bomber aircraft, and shot down five enemy aircraft, three B24s and two P38s. He returned to base despite suffering his fifth injury since the start of the Greater East Asia War. He has flown nearly a hundred sorties over the areas of Patang, Malaya, and Burma. Enemy aircraft seized by these "terrifying" claws number as many as thirty-four. This fighting spirit is a manifestation of the spirit of the Youth Aviation Corps and is the true face of the invincible "Army Air Force." Sergeant Satoshi Anabuki is currently in the 〇〇 Army Hospital, nursing an injury to his left finger. The supreme commander of the army in Burma praised his extraordinary actions, emotionally saying, "Rising up repeatedly after suffering injuries, this spirit of fighting to the end is the spirit of relentless attack. Anabuki is truly a good lad!" Sergeant Anabuki is a bright and outstanding young man. He hopes to shoot down one hundred enemy aircraft and is known as "〇〇 Anabuki," greatly feared by the enemy air force. The following is his diary:</p>
<p>February 9th: After receiving intelligence that nine enemy aircraft had taken off from the Lemaire and Kavka airfields, we immediately scrambled two squadrons. We discovered the enemy aircraft west of the Maliwon Rice Mountains. I only joined the battle over Koraishitol Island. Because I was a little late, I was unable to strike an enemy P40 head-on, only attacking a P40 attempting to flee south from behind and above. With one strike, I set its fuel tank on fire, and it crashed south of Koraishitol Island. During my second attack, I flew parallel to the enemy aircraft and struck again, finally shooting it down. In this battle, our squadron shot down a total of five enemy aircraft and severely damaged four.</p>
<p>〇月〇日: Transferred to Burma to attack Tinsukia.</p>
<p>January 25th:</p>
<p>The 〇〇's large formation soared over the great plains of Burma, bravely flapping its wings, crossed the 3,000-meter Arakan Mountains, and advanced towards the Tinsukia airfield. This was a grand and magnificent sight like clouds and rosy clouds, a grand aerial expedition, the likes of which we had never seen. The airfield was completely destroyed, and a hazy black smoke obscured the sky of Tinsukia, completely suppressing the enemy. I was assigned the task of providing air support, and together with Lieutenant Yamamoto, we guarded the northwest of the airfield. We spotted a Curtis P40, immediately attacking it. The enemy aircraft spun to the right, and I certainly did not miss this opportunity, quickly delivering a second strike. Gasoline spewed directly from near the root of the enemy aircraft, and the fuselage plunged vertically, finally crashing to the ground—shooting down one aircraft. Taking advantage of the situation, I made a super-low-altitude flight of 〇〇 meters over the smoke-filled enemy airfield, carrying out a ground attack on a surviving P40. Passing through intense anti-aircraft fire, I again attacked the P40 and anti-aircraft gun positions with a super-low-altitude flight, completely destroying one P40.</p>
<p>February 〇th (Chittagong Attack): After arriving over Chittagong and bombing the enemy airfield, as we were about to fly back, we were attacked by an enemy Hurricane. Without hesitation, I engaged in combat, immediately scoring a hit. The enemy aircraft spun downward and crashed rapidly in the area between the city and the airfield, burning to ashes.</p>
<p>December 〇th (〇 spotted a large formation of fourteen enemy bombers over 〇〇): "Too late!" I thought to myself. "Turn!" I shouted, my body already jumping into the aircraft, stepping on the throttle, and pulling the control stick. As I was taking off, the aircraft was already hit by enemy shrapnel. I ignored it, only intending to take off with the squadron leader's aircraft, and then the two of us would intercept them. During the ascent, I saw one enemy aircraft hit by our anti-aircraft fire and falling in flames, which made me feel a hundred times braver and desperately pursued. The enemy aircraft were divided into three layers: six Hurricanes below, six P40s above them, and five Blenheims on top. I fired at the left engine of the fourth Blenheim, causing it to burst into flames and plunge downwards. Just as I was about to attack the third aircraft, I was suddenly attacked by a P40. I immediately engaged in combat with it and quickly shot it down, and then returned in triumph.</p>
<p>December 〇〇th (Feni Attack): December 24th (Intercepting Enemy Fighters Over 〇〇): Over 〇〇, six Hurricanes attacked. My aircraft took off a little late, and because I forgot to step on the throttle, the speed was also a bit slow. I struck the enemy aircraft from the side, causing it to burst into flames and plunge downward. I further forced an enemy aircraft to crash-land in flames on the island of the Irrawaddy River. I saw an enemy pilot crawling out of the river and immediately notified the ground troops. Soon, the pilot raised both hands and became a prisoner. After interrogation, it was discovered that he was a major. All the attacking enemy aircraft were wiped out. How exhilarating! The squadron leader shot down one Hurricane, Sergeant Major So shot down two, and Sergeant Anabuki shot down three. What a thriving Nakazaki squadron!</p>
<p>December 〇〇th (Attack on Yunnan Station Airfield): Because refueling was five minutes late, I stepped on the throttle to catch up with the main force. I flew over the Nu River and crossed the Mekong River, but still could not catch up. Helplessly, I had to return and sadly welcome the New Year, unable to help but miss my hometown.</p>
<p>January 〇〇th (Flying to Yunnan Gathering Field, Bombers Showed Great Skill, Bombing the Airfield to Pieces): Among the fifteen enemy Curtis P40s, six rose, but after being attacked, they flew back. I chased after them and struck again, immediately trailing a white smoke, plunging downward.</p>
<p>〇月〇〇日 (Air Battle Against Bombers Over Rangoon): "Three enemy aircraft are approaching over the 〇〇 ocean!" After receiving the report, I bravely took off. After six rounds of intense battle, I shot down one Vickers Wellington bomber. As I was about to attack another, I suddenly fell into a state of unconsciousness, descending straight down to 250 meters above the sea before regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>January 〇〇th (Combat with B24 Over 〇〇): In the sky above the 〇〇 area at the mouth of the Rangoon River, seven black dots circled and soared, which were the enemy air force's proud Consolidated B24s. I attacked the third enemy aircraft in a formation of three in front, causing it to emit smoke. But it still wanted to escape, so I went after it and struck again. It then trailed a white smoke, remaining behind the formation. Giving it a final strike, it suddenly spewed black smoke, with its entire right wing engulfed in flames, and began to fall towards the ground. Originally, I wanted to chase the second aircraft, but unfortunately, both gasoline and bullets had run out, so I had to withdraw.</p>
<p>March 〇th (Participated in the Cox's Bazar Attack): I shot down two Hurricanes.</p>
<p>March 〇〇th (Pada Airfield Attack): Shot down two Hurricanes.</p>
<p>April 〇〇th (Duhazari Attack): Shot down one Hurricane.</p>
<p>April 〇〇th (First Imphal Attack): Three Hurricanes and my one aircraft engaged in a duel. As a result, I shot down two, and another was also damaged. All of our aircraft returned. In this battle, our side achieved the glorious record of shooting down fifteen enemy aircraft. Our fierce advance cleared out all enemy aircraft, and the triumphant song resounded with our unparalleled might!</p>
<p>April 〇〇th (Second Imphal Attack): Shot down two P36s, one of which spewed white smoke in the first round and crashed upside down.</p>
<p>April 〇〇th (Kunming Airfield Attack): Engaged ten P40s and shot down one.</p>
<p>May 〇〇th (Cox's Bazar Attack): Shot down one Hurricane. The Hurricane that crashed into the sea left only a trail of bubbles.</p>
<p>May 〇〇th (Second Kunming Attack): In this long-awaited attack, the opponents were all elite from the US Air Force! Of course, there were many enemies. Let's do it! After attacking twenty enemy giant aircraft four times, we suffered a chase attack by more than forty Curtis P40s. The battle was so intense that both sides began a melee. I scattered the enemy aircraft and conveniently rescued two friendly aircraft. After fighting fiercely for so long, I made about seven enemy aircraft emit white smoke, confirming that three had been shot down, but my beloved aircraft did not suffer a single bullet. All the ammunition I brought was used up.</p>
<p>May 〇〇th (Participated in the Chittagong Attack): Shot down one Hurricane.</p>
<p>May 〇〇th: Engaged more than ten Hurricanes and shot down two over the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>October 8th (Intercepting B24s and P38s Attacking Rangoon): Fought thirteen enemy aircraft with a single aircraft. Crashed three B24s and two P38s. My beloved aircraft was injured and forced to land. I survived to return to base on the third day. I was shot in the left finger. After being hospitalized, the 〇〇 unit commander personally came to express his condolences and explained the battle tactics. It was an honor! Whenever I think of this, I am even more determined to fight. The supreme commander of the army in Burma also sent an adjutant to express his condolences and bestowed a folding fan, for which I am immensely grateful. I only hope that my finger injury will heal soon, so that I can fight bravely in the air and repay his kindness. The supreme commander of aviation in the Southern Area also sent a congratulatory telegram, saying, "Respectfully saluting Sergeant Anabuki of your unit for his illustrious military exploits."

<h3 id="e32">A Petty Officer Shoots Down Ten Enemy Aircraft in One Day <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Extraordinary Achievement in the South Pacific Air War</p>
<p>Takeo Okumura, a young naval aviation petty officer who came from the Youth Flying Corps, achieved the glorious feat of personally shooting down ten aircraft in one day. On September 14th, in the Solomon Islands area, where the battle situation was extremely fierce, the Japanese naval aviation unit in the Poin region intercepted more than 240 enemy aircraft that came to attack, and, in cooperation with ground fire, shot down sixty of them. The Japanese side also lost a total of five aircraft that did not return after exploding. On that day, Petty Officer Okumura, who was active and energetic, was awarded a white-sheathed military sword engraved with "Outstanding Military Merit" by the commander of the 〇〇 fleet. How was this glorious record of shooting down ten aircraft in one day achieved? The reporter interviewed the warriors who fought alongside Petty Officer Okumura that day and learned the details of the air battle that day:</p>
<p>Shooting Down One Aircraft Right Away At 6:30 AM, after intelligence of an enemy aircraft attack arrived, 〇〇 fighter planes immediately took to the skies. After patrolling for thirty-five minutes, a large enemy formation was spotted at a long distance towards Joysole Island, and the interception battle began. The weather was clear and calm, perfect for air combat. The enemy consisted of eleven Consolidated B24-type aircraft and thirty fighter escorts, unfolding a fierce air battle. Petty Officer Okumura shot down a first Sutherland ski, and the enemy fighters were gradually shot down by our naval aircraft, seven in total. After the fighters were cleared, only the large aircraft remained. Our 〇〇 aircraft simultaneously attacked one of the enemy large aircraft. Petty Officer Okumura hit the first one. While escaping, he pursued at full speed for twenty minutes, until the enemy aircraft was forced to close and fired upon, being hit by more than a dozen bullets and crashing in flames.</p>
<p>The Enemy Aircraft Had Already Fled Far Away</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, when the lookout spotted the enemy aircraft, a蓬蓬 sound was heard, and simultaneously, it sounded like ten thousand thunderbolts were exploding, as they bombed our aircraft on the runway. Without waiting for the bombs to fall, the aircraft immediately took off, but it was too late. Twelve enemy 康〇里-type aircraft and thirty fighter aircraft had already fled far away.</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM, because the enemy had already fled, and while feeling extremely frustrated and planning to land, a signal came from the ground to "Postpone Landing." Immediately, he became a hundred times more energetic and stood by in anticipation, but the enemy did not come. "Isn't this a waste of effort?" Just as he was feeling tired and wanted to land again, another signal came to "Postpone Landing." "Okay, this time it must be," he waited in anticipation. They came, they came! At an altitude of 6,000 meters, more than forty Belle and Grumman type aircraft came in a large group.</p>
<p>The enemy and our side both had fighter aircraft, and the Belles and Grummans were both formidable enemies. But ultimately, they were no match, as they engaged in combat like swallows for thirty minutes. Falling, falling, more than half of the enemy aircraft, twenty-two in total, fell into the South Sea, feeding the fish. Among these, Petty Officer Okumura shot down two Belle types and one Grumman type.</p>
<p>Encouraging Each Other and Registering Again</p>
<p>Our 〇〇 aircraft landed at the base from time to time due to fuel shortages, and Okumura became anxious. His comrades encouraged each other and leaped into their aircraft.</p>
<p>The ground maintenance crew shouted, "Please don't fly above 〇〇 meters!" They were worried that there would be no 〇〇 Li. In the aircraft, he ascended into the sky and waited. Ah! There were too many, too many! Enemy carrier-based bombers and fighters filled the sky, totaling fifty carrier-based bombers and sixty fighter aircraft. "Very good, the more the better!"</p>
<p>A total of fifty-four aircraft were shot down. Our 〇〇 aircraft broke into the midst of several times the number of enemies, and those in its path fell. Those that fell were all enemy aircraft. After thirty minutes of air combat, five carrier-based aircraft were shot down, and fighters fell. A total of one carrier-based aircraft and four Grumman types.</p>
<p>Petty Officer Okumura's outstanding record includes four 〇〇 in the China Incident. Adding the ten from this day in the Greater East Asia War, the total is forty aircraft, for a total of fifty-four aircraft.</p>
<p>The Commander Said:</p>
<p>There are many records of shooting down many aircraft over a long period, but the record of shooting down ten aircraft in one day is unprecedented. In the blistering heat and the pestilent rain of the Pacific, Petty Officer Okumura's vigorous fighting spirit and strong physique are admirable. The daily and nightly air battles are all fought by these young air force warriors. As Marshal Yamamoto said, "Now is the era of young people." Petty Officer Okumura's extraordinary actions are due to his calm and decisive personality, continuous training, and repeated combat experience. It is hoped that all those who aspire to be air force warriors will have this spirit and physique. (Translated from the November 3rd Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>— Zu Ren</p>
<p>Drained of energy by the machines, sucked of blood and sweat by life—this is the meaning of labor: like a dream. But, it is not a dream. I have been making a living in the machine circle for six years now.</p>
<p>Organic human flesh and blood and energy, combined with the power of machinery, form the throbbing and roaring within the machine circle. I live silently within this circle, where every minute is governed by throbbing and roaring.</p>
<p>The humans here use their physical and mental strength to control the function of the machines, so that they can exert the highest productive capacity. But, the machines also suck the blood and sweat of humans to supply their functional consumption—it is always this kind of cycle. Every year, every month, every day, every hour, there is no season, and no climate. It does not stop, nor does it change.</p>
<p>A bolt of cloth is produced on the machines, but: the function of humans can never catch up with the excellent machinery. Thus: the people active in this circle become thin and emaciated, one by one!</p>
<p>The humans who do this kind of work that consumes machines and is also consumed by machines are the so-called laborers—a kind of people who sell their labor.</p>
<p>This kind of people who sell their labor was completely unfamiliar to me when I was in school. I only knew that there was this kind of people existing in the world! Of course: at that time, I was completely immersed in the desire to obtain academic credits. I had no time to explore everything about these humans whose destinies were different from ours. Moreover: at that time, I would never have thought that in the future, I would live closely with these humans that I had ignored and for a long time, with a history of more than six years!</p>
<p>Facts often disappoint ideals! Not at all false, it has been six years, and I have been living among the laborers.</p>
<p>Every day, when the hand of the clock points to the number seven, a group of laborers who have not yet shaken off their sleepiness are swallowed up by the two dark factory gates. At this time, they should begin to sell their labor. Yes, another day of work has begun…</p>
<p>Rushing into the factory, the yarn spindles and looms, under the skilled management of this large group of laborers, emit heavy, rough, monotonous roars, like this, until the night pushes darkness into the factory, only then does it stop its noisy clamor.</p>
<p>The air in the city is certainly filthy, but: take a look inside the factory. Grains, wool scraps fly, forming a thin mist like the one on the streets in the morning, blurring even the sunlight. The laborers work diligently in this filthy air, unaware of what hardship is.</p>
<p>You say: Working in this kind of filthy air is extremely detrimental to "nutrition," right! Yes, fresh air is a necessity for every organic human. Although this element of nutrition does not require spending money to purchase, and can be enjoyed freely, in the factory, enjoying fresh air is an extravagant hope. "Nutrition" is certainly needed, but: talking about excellent "nutrition" to a group of hungry people is no different from an emperor in a famine year saying to the hungry masses, "Why don't they eat meat porridge?"—it is generally unreasonable.</p>
<p>Yes! Air will never be as serious as the bread problem, in the minds of ordinary laborers. Otherwise, why is there only a demand for increased wages, and never a call for fresh air!</p>
<p>For the sake of life, they obediently subordinate everything they have to a strange, controlling chain. They have lost their autonomy, and life has become their master. They follow it, obey it: life makes them forget hardship and weariness.</p>
<p>Thin and emaciated! Sick! But: life is still strictly whipping them, so that they dare not stop for a moment to catch their breath. They are drained of energy by the machines and sucked of blood and sweat by life—the meaning of six years of labor.</p>
<p>Humans are drained of energy and sweat, to exchange it for the reward of the lowest living standard. This is a tragic transaction, but: for the sake of survival, our poor group of laborers is breathing in this kind of transaction:</p>
<p>The transaction of ordinary goods and values generally always has the value of the goods and the price equal. But ah! In my living circle, I see groups of laborers who have exhausted their blood, sweat, and energy, but: the reward! It is not even enough for the warmth and sustenance of a family. I do not believe that the price of human flesh and blood and energy is so low.</p>
<p>This kind of cheap sale of blood, sweat, and energy is a human tragedy, but there are really many of these tragedies performed by humans in the world!</p>
<p>Is labor really sacred! I often think.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Paulownia Leaves <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Tiecheng</p>
<p>The paulownia leaves in the courtyard are falling again, accumulating a thick layer in the past few days. The children are all gathered under the half-bald sycamore trees, picking up paulownia leaves. It is said that the leaf stems can be used as ink. Since I am idle, I also want to learn the children's games and try it. As soon as I step on the dry and yellow leaves, a series of ear-piercing and somewhat mournful cracking sounds are emitted, which makes people think of the magnificence and passion of youth when they were stirred by the breeze and played a magnificent and enthusiastic youth rhapsody. But now youth has become the past, and reverie has finally become reverie, gently blown away by the autumn wind, leaving only a desolate and dying funeral song. In a few more days, there will be no sound at all. Unless it was a particularly great person before, perhaps a child will see the greatness of its leaf stem and be forced to think of its greatness before, and say, "It used to be a surprisingly large leaf!" However, the past is the past, what about now? Picking paulownia leaves is indeed a very interesting game. The thicker and stronger it grows, the better the material, which is everyone's goal. If several children discover an outstanding big paulownia leaf at the same time, there will definitely be a conflict for the same goal. This is also something I have often seen.</p>
<p>I only picked five or six branches, but I gradually developed special and ridiculous feelings about the color and wormholes of the paulownia leaves on the ground. Gray means old age and death, which is natural and there is no need to feel sorry for it. Yellow means "great ambitions unfulfilled before death," which is regrettable. Green means premature death, which is innocent and most regrettable. Wormholes are more interesting, and can even be said to be more meaningful. Each one has its own appearance. The lines of the wormholes symbolize its past history: deep, shallow, thick, narrow, long, short, indicating the degree to which it has been eaten by worms, where it started to be eaten, where it ended up being eaten, and why it ate this one and not that one. All of these have research value. According to my ridiculous, childish observation, the reasons why it was eaten by worms are nothing more than two points: one is weakness, and the other is strength. From this, it can be seen that Confucius's doctrine of the mean does have some truth, no wonder the Master's teachings are used by many scholars as mouthpieces.</p>
<p>After picking for a while, my hands are full of them. Many of them have been eaten by insects. I guess that its life, in addition to sprouting, growing, maturing, and then being eaten by insects and dying, probably has not done anything else. Silently born, silently died, that's all.</p>
<p>Back in the study, I tested the leaf stems one by one, but they all failed. The ink marks on the inkstone were all wiped off, but there was still no success. In anger, I threw the leaf stems out the window and told the children not to bother. But one child said loudly, "Ink can't be used, but it can be dried and used as firewood." So they are still happily continuing to work, but no longer picking, but grabbing.</p>

<p>There is no easily walkable road. Even a goat path</p>
<p>cannot be seen. Rockslides form mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Like giant beasts, crouching all around. I will not shout: "There is no road!! There is no road!" I think: You can still stand on rockslides; if you stand on the first, you can naturally stand on the second. Three steps, four steps…</p>
<p>Doesn't it become "walking" then? What isn't a road that can be walked on? ××× Of course, there is no easily walkable road. Even a goat path cannot be seen. However, finally, I raised my scarred feet on the sharp and angular rockslides and began to step on the first step…</p>

<h3 id="e37">Football League Division One, First Act: Commentary on the Police vs. Overseas Chinese Match —Police: Strong Offense and Defense, Imposing Presence— —Overseas Chinese: Sudden Loss of Form, Disorganized— <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football League Division One match, originally scheduled to begin the previous week, was thus postponed. Last weekend, there were originally three matches, but Heaven was not kind, and yesterday's rain continued all day. Two exciting matches were again postponed due to rain. Of the remaining Saturday match, the Police easily defeated the Overseas Chinese, winning by a large margin of five to one, beyond expectations. Here is a brief account of the battle and a commentary on the skills of both teams.</p>
<p>The two teams met at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 p.m. on the 13th. Although the weather was sunny that day, the wind was strong, which inevitably affected the battle. As fans had not seen a match in a long time, they were happy to watch from the sidelines, with no fewer than seven hundred people, making for a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Account of the Battle</p>
<p>When the time arrived, the two sides lined up, the Police positioned to the south with the wind at their backs, and the Overseas Chinese to the north against the wind. Therefore, as soon as the battle began, the Police launched attacks one after another, and the Overseas Chinese formation was dominated by Police players. The two inner midfielders were busy trying to cope, but to no avail. In the twentieth minute, Huang Mao was the first to break through the net. After that, the Police's offensive became even more intense. The Overseas Chinese, disadvantaged by the wind, had their entire team scattered like sand. Let alone attack, fifteen minutes before the end of the first half, Huang Mao took advantage of an opening to score another goal.</p>
<p>After the break, although the Overseas Chinese had the help of the wind, they still seemed powerless. The Police players, especially the strong ones, fought even more bravely. Soon, Huang Mao scored a third goal. The Overseas Chinese players looked at each other in dismay, and a desperate struggle was inevitable. Fa Fanxiao suddenly raised his arm and shouted, and the whole army launched an attack. After a long melee, the Overseas Chinese got a chance to take a corner kick. The right forward took the kick and successfully used the wind to score a goal, making it 1-3, showing a slight improvement. Unexpectedly, this good moment passed quickly, like a flash in the pan. Afterwards, it became the Police's show again, with Quelunzifu scoring first, and then Huang Mao sealing the victory with a score of 5-1. The Police were the first to sing a victory song.</p>
<p>Commentary on the Police</p>
<p>The entire team relied on their strong physiques. When attacking, they watched the ball's landing point, and their five forwards advanced rapidly, which was very sharp and effective. The wingers were well-positioned, and their dribbling was all above par. As for shooting, apart from Huang Mao, it was still a bit weak. The midfield line was able to retreat to defend and help with the attack. Because of the weakness of the two wings of the Overseas Chinese team in this battle, they appeared particularly active. Tiefunini's marking of Fa Fanxiao in front of the center was an undeniable contribution. The two fullbacks, Luosai'er, were full of energy and well-positioned, and ran quickly. Ke Detuo seemed inexperienced, with errors occurring from time to time. If Fu'en had been playing, they would inevitably have lost some presence. Judging from this, they did not seem as experienced as Lianyi and Li Wu. Goalkeeper Fu Keni did not have much to show.</p>
<p>Speaking of individuals, Huang Mao (Robert Stoff) was as fierce as he was three years ago. His speed of advance was difficult to predict, and his skill in attacking the goal was especially difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. However, his turning ability was no longer as flexible as it used to be. The left winger, Quelunzifu, was not as fierce as Yuan Kuntian, but his steadiness also surpassed Yuan. The right winger, Li Ming, was a sprinter, and his dribbling and passing showed considerable skill. It was a pity that he lacked experience. Given time, he could become a great player. The rest of the players were all in normal form, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>Commentary on the Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese attack adopted a W formation, which had been quite successful in the past. I still remember the three draws between St. Francis and Eastern. With the replacement of Fu'en with Fa Fanxiao, the offensive could not be said to be weak. However, this battle was a major departure from the norm. The center forward got the ball and passed it to the wings, but neither winger could do anything with it, causing the two inner forwards to work in vain, resulting in a disjointed attack. The three midfielders were still able to supply the front line, and their marking was also diligent. However, Weiketai was helpless against Huang Mao. The two fullbacks were veterans with plenty of experience. Seeing Huang Mao's speed, they used their position to stay in front of him, causing him to be offside. Indeed, drawing the forwards offside was one of their tactics. Huang Mao was offside many times in this battle, which was commendable. However, Ka. Ka constantly used guards, which was a fatal flaw, because the ball would reach Huang Mao first, creating potential danger. This was a lack of adaptability. Goalkeeper Mali. Te was not a top player and was careless in his response.</p>
<p>Speaking of individuals, the most commendable player in this battle was right midfielder Mo Erfo, who ran all over the field and made successful saves. Kaloliequ contributed more than he erred and should not be blamed for the loss. None of the five forwards were commendable. Fa Fanxiao was effectively marked by the opponent, but after getting the ball, he passed it to the wings, which ultimately led to nothing. Being isolated and helpless, a hero was at his wits' end and could only be seen wandering around the field. The right winger, Bola Ge, lacked experience and was slow in his movements. If he had been replaced by Fu'en, there would have been at least two chances to score into an empty goal. Was Bola Ge useless? Did his direct corner kick into the net, breaking the duck egg, slightly reduce his guilt? Left winger Kaposi Ting was also slow and clumsy and could not coordinate with the midfield, which was also a manifestation of the abnormal state after the loss. (Mei Bixian)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Ping-Pong Practice Methods: A Guide for Beginners <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>To ensure that everyone has a healthy body, we must pay attention to sports. Therefore, promoting sports is one of the most important conditions for making the body healthy. The more we use our bodies, the more developed they become. But some sports make the body develop in a distorted way. Ping-pong is a sport that develops the whole body evenly. Not only is the whole body exercised evenly, but it also requires "turning the mind." It is a sport that uses both hands and brain, so it is especially worthy of our promotion.</p>
<p>Knowing the importance of exercise, many people can make a preliminary attempt, but not many can persist. The reason is probably because they don't understand the methods of exercise and don't get the real fun of exercise. Some people cannot abide by the rules of the sport and get along with others. Playing as if in a play is of no help to the health of the body. Therefore, it is very important for us to promote table tennis. And it is especially important to seriously study "Ping-Pong Technique" so that beginners can get a stepping stone and those who are proficient can get more opportunities to learn from each other.</p>
<p>The Way of Offense and Defense</p>
<p>Because few people talk about "Ping-Pong Technique" on weekdays, it is really like a twenty-four history. Where do you start? The author is not talented, so I will write down some of the methods I have used to study ping-pong for more than ten years for the reference of comrades from all walks of life.</p>
<p>There are many ways to play ping-pong, but they can be roughly divided into two types: one is "blocking," a defensive ball that is cut. The other is "smashing" and "pressing," an offensive ball. Beginners should first lay a solid foundation in defense. That is, when competing with others, they should first defend and maintain their position without losing, and then look for opportunities to attack.</p>
<p>There are many ways to defend. The first thing to do is to practice "close blocking." Regardless of whether the opponent's ball is a light block or a heavy hit, the practitioner should return the ball with the most sincere attitude, just trying to hit it a few more times to extend the practice time. With this kind of attentive practice, after a certain period of time, experience will gradually increase, and the nature of the ball will become clear. No matter what kind of hard ball it is, you will have the ability to respond to the situation. Then practice "long blocking" and "cutting." After practicing various techniques, practice "light smashing." Although this "light smashing" does not have much power, it is more powerful than cutting, and can prevent the opponent's fierce attack or vicious cut, and can make the incoming ball more accurate and not hard. After the practice of "light smashing" has a considerable degree of certainty, gradually increase the power of the smash under the condition of accuracy, to achieve the stage of fierce attack and hard hitting.</p>
<p>"Close blocking" is the basis of "cutting," and "light smashing" is the basis of "fierce attack." So, to practice the ball, you must first practice defense. To defend, you must first practice "close blocking," "long blocking," and "cutting." After practicing these well, you can further practice "light smashing" and "fierce attack." This method is like building a house. First, you must lay a solid foundation. If the roots are deep and firm, there will naturally be very little danger.</p>
<p>Three Stages</p>
<p>From the process of learning ping-pong, it can be divided into three stages. Each stage has a goal that should be worked hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Beginner Stage: You must concentrate all your energy on the point of the ball. That is, the position where the ball bounces on the table, the ball speed, the soft ball on the racket, about one-half faster than before, the rotation speed of the ball, the direction of the ball, etc. After the ball hits the table, you can get the direction of the ball. At the same time, pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the racket. Hitting the ball in the middle of the racket is very difficult. But the reaction of the middle of the racket is the strongest. And various hitting methods can also be correct. The reaction force on the west side of the racket is reduced, and it is difficult to grasp various hitting methods. So, in the beginner stage, pay close attention to the ball, and at the same time pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the racket.</p>
<p>In this stage, it is not appropriate to imitate skilled ping-pong players to hit the ball, and to hit hard balls indiscriminately. Pay attention to not touching the net and not going out of the table. Fully restrain the ball. Hit the ball within one foot of the baseline. And you must first practice the hand holding the racket in front of your body. Second, practice the hand holding the racket back. After learning these two methods, you can practice hitting the ball sideways.</p>
<p>After each return of the ball, be prepared to return the next ball. Because only by being prepared at all times can you cope with the situation at any time. Otherwise, you will be attacked unexpectedly and be at a loss.</p>
<p>If you can hit the ball almost every time in the middle of the racket, and you can hit the opponent's table almost every time, then you can be considered to have completed the first stage of the course.</p>
<p>Training Stage: In this stage, you should pay attention to correcting your weaknesses and practicing various hitting methods. If you have one less hitting method, you have one more flaw, and the opponent has one more chance to win. And you must know how to save energy. You should attack when you should attack, and you should defend when you should defend. Don't defend or act recklessly. Be quick to respond for a long battle.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you should also pay attention to the opponent's movements. Because if you understand the opponent's movements, you can predict the direction of the opponent's return of the ball. There are roughly the following points to observe:</p>
<p>1. The opponent's wrist, racket, and body posture when hitting the ball;</p>
<p>2. The position of both you and the opponent and the hitting posture;</p>
<p>3. The position of the opponent and the ping-pong table;</p>
<p>4. The position of the racket;</p>
<p>5. Research the opponent's habits and commonly used strategies.</p>
<p>If you can pay attention to the above points, then it is not difficult to predict what kind of ball the opponent will hit.</p>
<p>In this stage, you must not only correct your weaknesses, practice various hitting methods, and pay attention to the opponent's movements, but also train your hands and feet. Training your hands is an important thing. But when hitting the ball, if your feet don't help actively, you won't succeed. To cope with the opponent's attack in any direction, you must have a flexible response. This kind of all-round skill depends on the activity of the feet.</p>
<p>Proficiency Stage: You should already have a very good understanding of the principles of playing the ball, and you also play the ball very well. You are also used to various common movements. So, in this stage, ping-pong players look at the table with a flat eye, and make more observations in front of the enemy to make the final correction of their return of the ball.</p>
<p>The eye is the representative of the heart. Skilled ping-pong players don't pay attention to watching the ball, but measure the opponent's table to determine the direction of their return. Therefore, many skilled ping-pong players observe the opponent's eyes to judge the direction of the opponent's return. However, this kind of decision is also easy to be deceived. Some people focus their eyes on a certain direction, but hit the ball in the opposite direction. This kind of hitting method is easy to confuse the opponent and make it difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>There is no fixed and easy method for hitting ping-pong. It all depends on the individual's flexible use. It all depends on being enthusiastic and skillful. For example, if the smashing and pressing balls are sharp, rapid, and stable, the effect is often not very great. If the smashing ball is spinning and the pressing ball is cutting, then the person returning the ball must not only carefully observe the direction of the ball, but also carefully observe the direction of the ball, because the direction of the spinning ball after hitting the table will not necessarily be the same as before hitting the table. The cutting ball is even as light as a feather, making it elusive.</p>
<p>In short, although ping-pong is a small skill, its interest and mystery cannot be exhausted. Sometimes it is not something that can be conveyed by pen and ink, but depends entirely on one's own experience. (End) Chen Linsheng</p>
<h3 id="e39">Simple Fitness Training Method (9) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>—Written by Tom, Translated from German—</p>
<p>22. Hip Exercises</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>Stand upright, with your body weight on your left foot. First, contract your right foot back as far as possible, then raise your knee, bringing the foot forward until the lower leg is fully extended. At this time, the leg position is very similar to a racehorse, its foot eager to land. Place the ball of the foot on the ground, contract the leg back to its original position, and continue the exercise without stopping.</p>
<p>Hip Exercise: Body weight on the left foot, contract and extend the right foot, rest.</p>
<p>Note: Continue this exercise for several seconds each time. If it is difficult to maintain balance at first, you can place your left hand on a chair or table.</p>
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<p>Stand upright, with your body weight on your right foot. First, contract your left foot back as far as possible, then raise your knee, bringing the foot forward until the lower leg is fully extended. Place the ball of the foot on the ground, contract the leg back to its original position, and continue the exercise without stopping.</p>
<p>After working the legs hard for a short time, place your hands on your hips and walk a few steps, noting the immediate effect. This method can achieve great results with very little practice, making it almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>Hip Exercise: Body weight on the right foot, contract and extend the left foot, rest.</p>
<p>Note: Continue this exercise for several seconds each time. Practice in groups, and the number of repetitions is determined by the instructor.</p>
<p>23. Knee Exercises</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>Stand upright, with your body weight on your left foot. Raise your right knee until the calf muscles come into contact with the thigh. Quickly lower the foot to the ground, but without making a sound.</p>
<p>Knee Exercise: Body weight on the left foot, raise and lower the right foot. Hip Exercise, Exercise 2.</p>
<p>Knee Exercise, Exercise 1</p>
<p>Knee Exercise, Exercise 2</p>
