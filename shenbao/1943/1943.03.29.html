<h3 id="c1">戰時生活與勤儉 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>「生活與戰鬬一致者强，相離者弱，相背者亡」。我們讀中外的歷史，都可證明這句話的正確性。例如古代羅馬帝國，他們在承平時候，國民的一般生活都是頹廢浪漫，驕奢淫佚，所以不久就趨於滅亡之境。平常時候尚且如此，何况是在戰時？相反的，例如日本，六七十年前在歐美侵略勢力扣關之時，內憂外患，不下於十餘年來的中國，但是因爲全國國民生活振肅，人人知道愛國，數十年間，就一躍而爲世界强國。再如德國，當第一次世界大戰失敗之時，外受列强的分割與壓迫，內有黨派粉爭與革命，但是因爲國民奮發努力，生活緊張而嚴肅，二十年間又復雄飛全歐。就拿我國的歷史來看，也有許多表現戰時生活精神的事實。最明顯的如晋陶侃的朝夕運變，祖逖的聞鷄起舞，都是在國家危急之時，振作一已生活的表現。現在我們對英美宣戰已二個多月，一般日常生活，都應充分表現戰時的物色，效法現代日德國民的刻苦愛國，一方面增加生產，一方面節約消費。講到增加生產，我們第一步必須做到生活的日用品能够自給自足，第二步必須做到充實物資，供給作戰的需要。至於節約消費，就是把物資節約下來，留爲國用。中華民族本來是勤儉的民族，能勤就可以增加生產，能儉自然能節約消費，以生產者的身份，來努力於本位工作是勤，以消費者來節約自己的生活是儉。每一個人都在勤儉上用些工夫，這並不是挾泰山以超北海的難事，也不是英雄豪傑才能做的事，每一個平凡國民都能做得到的平調而又光榮的事。戰時生活的眞義，不過如此。如果不勤不儉，以安逸爲榮耀，以揮霍撐塲面，便是民族的不肖子女，在自己良心上也一定不安的。何况，當此友邦對我特別尊重的時候，看到我們參戰後的生活，還不是戰時生活，結果也會影響到他們的感想。所以我們每一個人，不要以爲自己個人的生活，不會影響整個國家民族，而要認淸「天下興亡，匹夫有責」的重大意義。古人說：「哀莫大於心死」，我們在今天，大家都應自問，我的心是否已死？只要人心不死，那么，人人就看得見我們中華民族光輝燦爛的前途，烣復民族的自尊心興自信心，振作起來，勵行戰時生活，互相勸勉，互相吿誡，則不僅今日可吿無愧於國家和友邦，而他年也可示大義與貽光榮於自己的子孫。</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎原著</p>
<p>再就日英差異的最大之來說。英國是一個徹頭徹尾的議會中心國，日本則是一個徹頭徹尾的皇室中心國。英國的政治是自下壓上的政治，日本的政治則是皇室中心的政治。英國的君主，有史以來雖不像今日美國那樣採用正式的公選制，却也是由若干的豪族，酋長，及其他有力者的商議而選舉，或是得其承諾同意的。</p>
<p>英國的歷史，在對外關係上。是一部爲外國所征服，或是企圖征服大陸上某些領土而失敗的歷史：在對內關係上，　是國王和人民爭奪權力的歷史。而其所謂人民者，當初係指大地主的貴族，後來則指中地主，小地主，一轉而指商業成功者的大資本家及中流階級，最後則指一般勞力者而言。</p>
<p>其人民與君主爭奪權力的結果，便是舉一切的政權而歸於議院。至於所謂議院，詳細說來，則不是上院而是下院，不是貴族院而是庶民院。像英國歷史所說一樣，英國的議會，從國土一邊看來，乃是一個徵集租稅的機關。英國實是以這樣的觀念成爲其基調的，即他們認國家完全爲一個商業股份公司，人民是其股東，國王是其經理，經理是爲了保護或增進股東的利益而設的。因此雖一分一厘之微，若未經股東—人民的承諾，就不能徵集，成爲其原則。</p>
<p>所謂無代議士即無納稅，是英國立國以來的不成文律；美國獨立，雖不能說全部，而其最多部分，也是從這個原則算出來的。</p>
<p>有着那樣特性的英國議會，所以常爲了其主張而和國王衝突。因此國王總是打算着儘可能而節省經費，儘可能而不做事情，儘可能而不召集議會；可是碰到意外而不得不微集新稅，或有恢復業已取消的舊稅的必要時，乃不得已而召集議會，飪决召集，議會也就這樣漸决擴大其權力了。</p>
<p>國王若是偶然不顧到這個原則，則人民即以國王爲敵而起爭亂。英國第一次的革命，就是這樣發生的，其結果便是查理士一世成爲斷頭台上的犧牲者。因爲英國的議會竟敢於爲斬殺國王之事—雖然這個議會也曾受過克倫威爾兵士（鐵軍）的威迫—故其像廢立國王一類的事，完全和股東會更換經理一樣，什麼阻碍都沒有的</p>
<p>第二次革命，把詹姆士二世從英國放逐出去，更從荷蘭迎入奥倫其（Orange）王威廉及王后美利，從這件事上看來，也可知道英國議會的權力了。英國的憲法學家迪西（Dicey，Albert　Venn）稱贊英國議院之無限大的權力而曾這樣說：「無論什麼事情，英國議院沒有做不得的，惟有以議會的議決，不能使男性變成女性，女性變成男性而已。」正是說得不錯。</p>
<p>因此在英團的議會，如變更政體等事，雖只由一個議員的動議而被提出，要其實現，也決非不可能的。就是在維多利亞女皇中期以後的時代，也有一個却來斯兌爾克爵士，提出過要把共和政體移入英國的動議。雖然那個爵士不久終於把其詭激的議論緘默下去了，可是他在第二格蘭斯頓內閣時代，却做了外交次官，發揮了相當的勢力。而關於他做次宮的一事，據說女皇還曾向格蘭期頓訴說過苦情，也非不可置信的。</p>
<p>像這樣的議會中心主義，支配着英國，雖在今日，還是如此。句爾溫會向愛德華八世，問他還是和辛普森夫人斷絕其不自然的結合關係呢，還是要拋棄王位呢，逼他於二者之間選擇其一。這不用說，也是因爲那個包爾溫的前後，擁有多數議會分子做其與黨之故。實行那件事的，雖然是包爾溫，但其使其實行的，不妨說就是議會。</p>
<p>如上所述的議會中心主義，在日本是決不應該倡導的，苟有倡導之者，就不免是亂臣賊子。然而以尊王愛國之徒自命的人們，竟有泰然倡導議會中心主義的，世間也容認之而不以爲怪，那就不得不說畢竟是把日本認爲東亞的英國，或是還希望日本成爲東亞的英國了。</p>
<p>總之，要在日本國內把崇拜盎格魯撒克遜的陋習掃除凈盡，必須先使理解日本和英國，其立國的根本精神是絕對不能並立的，是爲第一要義。</p>
<p>（三）盎格魯撒克遜人的評定</p>
<p>究竟盎裕魯撒克遜人是一宗什麼寳貨呢？歷史家是這樣說着的：</p>
<p>「白色巨大的軀體，猙獰的碧眼，帶赭色的金黃頭髮，健啖饕餮，貪杯嗜酒，晝夜牛飲，了不爲恥」。</p>
<p>可是這些話對於盎格魯撒克遜人還只是皮相之見。如果把這蠻頑而富於動物性的盎格魯撒克遜人剖析觀察，可見是具着不能簡單地加以類別的性格。說他獃嗎，却是很機敏的；說他耽於逸樂嗎，却是極活動的；說他揮霍嗎，却又很會賺錢。宗敎心雖然很濃厚似的，一方面海盜根性却又透骨徹髓。雖然愛好動物，慣於牽狗弄馬，同時背地裏却恣意虐殺，夷然不加憫惜。</p>
<p>巡遊世界者們，即使是除了日本語以外而不知其他者，對於盎格魯撒克遜人的那種堂堂姿勢，有像壓倒他民族似的風采，恐怕不吝加以認識的吧。不但他們自己以爲具有優越的性格而自誇，便是對於其他民族，無問愛憎，也很能使之認許他們的優越性。就是像法蘭西人那樣以站於世界文化最高峰的文化人自誇的，也還是寫作看題爲「盎格魯撒克遜人的優越性」一類的書籍。</p>
<p>這樣，他們在世界上目空一切的高視闊步着。實則他們原是世界上一個餃惹氣的民族。不論是老家的英國人，或爲其分莊的美國人，除了猶太人之外，都有揮金如土的習性。又在盎格魯撤克遜人裏面，驢蒙虎皮的猶太人，也不在少數。所謂「世上只要是金錢」，他們在世界七儘所有的避寒塲，避暑塲，溫泉浴塲，以及其他一切享樂塲所，無不去盡情地享受着。</p>
<p>原來老家的英國人，還是較爲穩正一點，新家的美國人，則更會搭起有錢人的架子來。他們的優越感，可把「入於羅馬，從於羅馬」的一諺來說明，不管在什麼塲所，總是把自己的行派，老不客氣地使出來。不管對造不對造，歡喜不歡喜，總是强賒掗賣。那畢竟是因爲「世界是我們所有的」的意識，存在於他們腦海裏的緣故。</p>
<p>現在來略爲一述盎格魯撒克遜人的本相，而舉出幾個對於他們的評定來吧。生在英國的大詩人擺倫說：</p>
<p>「天地之間，像英國人那樣可惡的傢伙是沒有的。我很不高興和他們接近，如果可能的話，我很想在遠處去憎惡他們。除了地獄之外，我是再沒有和他們一塊兒居處的塲所的」。</p>
<p>英國人的撒謊，從古以來有名的。挨拉斯姆斯說：</p>
<p>「一說到眞僞的問題，英國一般是有着惡評的」。</p>
<p>挨拉斯姆斯是荷蘭人，爲歐陸的碩學，牛津大學是他講學之地，他是決不會對英國人有着惡感的，可是他還是說着那樣的話。</p>
<p>又，腓特烈大王說：</p>
<p>「英吉利政治的第一義，是對於其同盟國要求一切，而自己却一毛不拔。」</p>
<p>當日英同盟締結的時候，日本的政治家要是知道腓特烈的話，一定是有所戒備的吧。</p>
<p>在維多利亞朝的上牛期，有名的外交大臣巴麥斯頓曾這樣宣稱：</p>
<p>「英國沒有恒久的敵人，也沒有恒久的同志，而只有恒久的利益。」</p>
<p>巴麥斯頓所說的意思，就是苛其有利益，儘可賣掉同志而和敵人握手。這是英國人的慣拔。而這讀現在只要一看今日英美和蘇聯的關係，就可思過半了。</p>
<p>美國獨立檄文的簽署者之一，避雷針的發明者富蘭克林說。。</p>
<p>「無論那一國民，恐怕沒有一個不希冀英國被屈辱的」</p>
<p>富蘭克林的十二德，是他對於人生的敎訓。而這個十二德的宣示者之富蘭克林，竟至於　冀英國被屈辱，實是和他的爲人不相侔稱的話，可是英國是怎樣地爲世界人士所憎厭，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>哥德說道：</p>
<p>「無論從那方面看，像英國那樣僞善者和假正經人之多的地方，恐怕沒有。無論那個國家，像英國那樣徹底地爲「我利我執」所支配的國家，恐怕沒有。無論那一個民族，像英國那樣，於其政治的和個人的關係上，最爲沒有人道的闕民，也恐怕沒有。」</p>
<p>哥德決不是慣說詭語激言的文士，他是一個把宇宙藏在腦海裏的具有最完備的頭腦的哲人。使他說這句話，決不是偶然的。英吉利人的僞善，實是升堂入室。他們所謂「紳士」，是偽善的稱號。他們在國內—在人衆所見之處—斯文，矜莊，慇懃，恭敬地舉止着，可是一出國外，就無所顧慮地放肆起來，所謂海盜的本性，不期而自然暴露出來了。</p>

<p>— 胡賢豐</p>
<p>讀了二十三日本報短評「節電」後，深深的感想目前本埠電流的消耗問題。自大東亞戰爭爆發後，上海的電力公司，爲了煤斤來源不暢，存煤不足，不得不向電流用戶一再要求節省用電。此項减電的辦法，除了特殊與社會事業（學校醫院等）外，卽是生產製造的工廠，娛樂塲所，住宅，前者公司的减電是百分之十左右，後者幾乎達到百分之九十還強；從這兩者比較下，社會事業固屬重要，但試問爲求生產的工廠難道亦能與普通娛樂塲所同樣嗎？工廠的重要性，即使在戰前，諒各界亦很明瞭，何况在大東亞戰爭的今日，上海對於國家戰時經濟地位，又是站在最前綫的，其工業的重要性是自可不言而喻。我們可隨意舉例來看：德國頻年以來，南征北討，未嘗敢把國內工廠的工作稍爲停頓，男工缺乏時，照例用婦女來補充。記得某國有一位國防家說：「唯有工業才可振興國家」，我們旣知道工業。製造的重要及戰時生產的迫切，那麼電力公司方面何苦反把一般生產工作的工廠冷酷的予以减電呢？</p>
<p>上面所說種種，尚不是直接的看法，再從社會方面來講，廠方爲了電度限止未能充分工作，一月中往往未能做足半月工，有些工廠甚至限度到未能開工，當然工廠並非慈善機關，爲了原動力停止，工人無工可作，紛紛的趨向失業途中，社會又多了一羣無生　的人，這種情形明眼人想不難見到吧！</p>
<p>再說節電的原意，節約本屬美德，可是要抓住它的中心，像本市娛樂塲所，即是一個好例，假如說一句反話，要是把限電的辦法，施用在數千百娛樂塲所而不加之於工廠方面，那末整個的社會，定會景氣，並且對於慣於享受的人們，至少亦能節約一點。然則事實上每天衹見到戲館，歌塲，藝院的開幕，限電與節電又在那裏呢？</p>
<p>我希望各界人們提出意見，共同討論，同時希望電力公司方面，向當局竭力疏通煤斤來源，並給與上海工廠方面最低限度的用電便利，此則社會幸甚，國家幸甚矣！（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3 id="c38">經濟界　滬市金融與工商市况趨平 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>滬市金融工商市况，上週聞在當局嚴密統制之下，益臻穩定，錢　拆息掛牌爲一角六分，商品市價如米，雜糧麵粉肥皂，火柴，豆油，棉紗，棉布等公定價格均照舊不動，各業交易市况均趨疲　云。</p>

<p>當局於頒行同業公會法規之後，並有重行調整各業同業公會之舉，此誠當前之急務，自不待言。蓋在歷行物資統制時代，其最要機構，厥爲各業同業公會。惟同業間往往以利害不同關係，有各自爲政另樹一幟之習慣，故同一行業，而公會有多至十處或十餘處者，事權不一，稽攷無從，甚至互相攻擊，各遂私　，實屬無可諱言。故今後同一行業，急應規定一種劃一性之同業公會，嚴正名稱，並責成本業中公正淸廉，負有信譽之領袖若干人，出而負責組織，由本市經濟局會同市商會派員指導，予以合理的改組，毋使少數人或不良分子從中把持或搗亂，致礙會務之進行。尤希望政府於頒布法規以外更能早日筐訂各項施行細則，指導其組織手續，俾各業公會改組時有所依據。</p>
<p>同時，商業統制總會及市商會等機關，旣同爲民間商業機構，對於各同業公會，應倡導督率之責，並應隨時召集各業公會之中堅分子，多多舉行座談會，討論整頓同業規章及推行政府經濟綱領之方策，而於各業之陋規以及不良習慣，務須予以澈底之革除。藉使弊絕風淸，則各項政策之推行，自然順利。</p>

<p>全國商業統制總會成立以還，中國經濟之自治統制機構，已吿確立，二十五日之最高國防會議上，復又通過工商同業公會暫行條例，即日公佈，故下層機構，估計其在一個月內必能全部完成。關於調整下層機構一事，統制總會方面已着手調查現有之旣存各公會，同時數度召集各公會主要人物商洽具體事項，總之，下層機構之調整，其焦點，即爲對於現有之三百餘所公會，將調整合併至何種程度，聞統制總會方面根據一種商業一個公會之原則，採取俟商界自動合併之方針，而一般商界方面亦頗明白事態，具有自動合併之意向。</p>
<p>統制總會之調整下層機構方針，對於單位公會，將儘量縮少，擬收編至一百所以下，預料各業之聯合公會，不至超出二十所。</p>
<p>同時物資統制審議會，已吿成立中日各代表委員亦經決定，定於四月一日在滬舉行首次委員會，協商物資之綜合需給計劃，指導統制之根本方針等項，同時日商之動向，頗爲外界矚目，日商方面之調整單位組合，似亦有根據一種商業一個組合之主義，而自動加以調整之意，衆認日商方面將在商工會議所指導下而自動合併，編入新產銷機構內。（三月二十八日大陸新報）</p>

<p>在進行作戰中，而整理軍事上所支付的軍票，這是不易多見的特例。可是大東亞戰爭，現在是逐步進行之中，一面作戰，一面建設，是現在作戰的主鵠。在一個國家之中，有二種系統的通貨流通，在其實力基礎不同的塲合，當然引起種種不便，不但使統一通貨政策遭遇困難，而且要影響到加強友邦中國的工作，這次停止發行軍票新鈔後，國府的通貨已獲得了自主權，中儲券雖然已經可以統一中國的通貨，可是日本的責任，並未减輕，支持中儲券的責任，今後反而重大，爲了要維持通貨的價値，在其背後就有二個不可缺少的條件：這就是生產力和物資的存在，所以必須使共榮圈各地分別增加生產，並謀溝通各地的物資交流，這才是維持幣値，使大東亞成爲眞正共榮圈的原理。日本對於國府，在物資上，資金上向來不惜援助，今後更將盡最大的努力。軍票在過去雖已建立了打倒舊法幣的煊赫成績，但是要知道通貨戰決不就此終止，進一步的鬥爭還在今後哩。（雲鵬：譯自三月廿六日朝日新聞社論）</p>

<h3 id="c45">上海文藝界的再建 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 靑之</p>
<p>中日事變至大東亞戰爭勃發爲止，上海是叫做「孤島」。這個「孤島」與上海文藝界的關係，可比荒野中的「溫室」和溫室裏的花的關係一樣的。所以，在那個時候，不管是如何地充滿着鬬爭性或開得怎麼好看熱鬧，都不過是溫室裏的花而已。碰到砲聲一響，孤島的特殊性消失的時候，這些一切也就同時底變成過去了。</p>
<p>現在還有許多文藝作者，或追慕過去，或頹廢，或改行，消極沈默等等。這在上海文藝界的再建途上都是很可惜的。</p>
<p>開在溫室裏的花，其生命力的强弱，需要把牠放在外面試一試才會知道。同樣，失去了「孤島」特殊性的上海，能不能冉建立有光輝的文化基礎，也要看上海文化人是否有强壯的性格。過去是不會冉來的。「孤島」的特殊性非但永遠不會再來，就是殘滓也快要完全被淸算的了。上海文藝界的再建，必須認淸這個現實，而後，積極努力去建設明天的基礎，在這個上面，去樹起我們的文藝旗幟。</p>
<h3 id="c46">櫥窗的一有 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 陳楷</p>
<p>一條僻靜的馬路，在這太陽快要落山的時候是很少有車馬走過的；兩旁的商店也很少有人光顧，死沉沉的都沒有一點生氣，斜陽照在左邊店家灰塵堆滿的櫉窗裏似乎覺得非常乾燥，在那一排商店的中間有着一爿舊貨店，因爲所賣的東西旣是破舊，櫥窗又不收拾，史是骯髒，裏面堆滿了各式各樣　東西，也都非常雜亂，其中有着一隻掛着的梵啞林獨自奏着悲憤的調子，我們很可以聽出他是異常厭惡着人世；同時又有着一枝鋼筆，堅毅筆挺的站着，具有一副百折不撓的神情，他似乎非常驚異的聽着梵啞林的獨奏，不久，他終於不耐煩的想禁止梵啞林了：</p>
<p>「你爲什麼要奏那種悲憤的音調呢？世界須要我們不斷的努力改造，我們現在暫時的休息在這裏，我們爲什麼還要自尋煩惱呢？」</p>
<p>梵啞林聽他這樣說，也便停了下來回答他道：</p>
<p>「我是再也不想活下去了，世界到處充滿着刁奸，殘酷，沒有一點正義的存在，這樣的世界還有什麼可留連的地方呢？我再也不能忍受，我不能再在這樣的世界中生活，我討厭着一切，也討厭着自己，我將拉斷我的心弦，喊破我的喉嚨，請你不要阻擋我，那是我自己情願而且高興的。」</p>
<p>鋼筆冉也忍耐不住了，他喊了出來：</p>
<p>「誰說世界上沒有正義，不過他是隱藏着的，只要你去找牠，你便會發現牠，不過你悲憤着而不想和他接近，那你是永遠不會發現牠的，只要我們努力打破一切黑暗，剷除心底裏的憂傷，正義就會在我們的眼前了，看歷代偉大的人物！他們有着雄厚的自信力和堅毅的精神，打倒了任何兇險的障礙，他們是成功了，找到了眞理，發現了正義，並且替人類找到了幸福，又像我從前的主人用了我不停的書寫，爲了人類的正義而書寫，一直寫到他死的那一刻，難道那些書本中沒有正義嗎？想想我們奮鬥得來的幸福吧！不要再那樣詛咒世界吧！世界是美麗的，可愛的！可惜你沒有發現它。」</p>
<p>梵啞林似乎是在想着那奮鬥得來美好的田園，他發出了幽靜和悅的音調，我們聽着似乎也到了一片平曠的土地，兩邊密排着樹林，天似乎已經夜了，月兒慢慢的在昇起啊！在那端有着一所茅屋前面是田園，那是多美好和平的所在啊！沒有任何的刁奸，有的只是和藹，平靜，又有幾個人出現在那塲所了，他們也都和氣的行走工作，沒有一點搶奪的現象，梵啞林似乎也漸漸覺得可愛而戀戀不拾了，突然他停止了他的歌聲，自言自語的道：</p>
<p>「那是幻夢，幻夢，決不會有的幻夢。」</p>
<p>然而鋼筆却非常自信的說</p>
<p>「所有的强兇的事件，完全由於魔鬼而發生，我們剷除了魔鬼不是就能得那美麗平靜的所在了嗎？我們要自己去努力去找尋，現在聽我來唱，使我們不再灰心。」</p>
<p>於是鋼筆提起了他那强有力的喉嚨雄偉的唱了起來：</p>
<p>「我們年靑，我們年靑，</p>
<p>我們有熱的心，有勁的</p>
<p>我們有能力工作——</p>
<p>來創造人類的幸福。</p>
<p>我們有仁愛的心靈來感化一切，</p>
<p>創造人類的正義，</p>
<p>找尋人類的眞理。</p>
<p>我們有百折不攪的精神來毀滅黑暗，</p>
<p>打破人類刁奸的思想，</p>
<p>消滅人類殘酷的精神。</p>
<p>我們年靑，我們年靑，</p>
<p>我們有沸的血，有用的腦力，</p>
<p>我們有能力不斷的工作</p>
<p>使世界光明。」</p>
<p>梵啞林沉醉在這維偉的歌聲裏了，他似乎漸漸在覺醒着。</p>

<p>— 宋濂</p>
<p>白煤又漲了。</p>
<p>一九四二年十月，正富白煤的最高潮期。無處就省不來熱量的都市裏，這當然是小容暫緩的趨冋。然而，大腹便便的先生們除了視之爲生財的路道外，假意地蹙一蹙眉，已經算是造同情之峯頂了。</p>
<p>然而「大兵過後必有大疫，一那批受薪水支配而將每一個小錢都打上預算的算　子的朋友，以及一批以撈煤屑爲生的外鄉人就祇得　充這人禍的殉難者了。</p>
<p>惡運終於襲出上了這一羣人的頭，晨光熹微的淸晨，伴着馬桶車轔轔聲音已再聽不到朗爽的篩煤的聲調，以及指東劃西的父親的命令了。在生的爭鬬中，勤勞已經失去了應有的力量，別開一生的法則——</p>
<p>他們一羣有工作精誠而失去工作機會的靈魂，成天地閒着，閒着。然而餓的惡魔畢竟是可怕的。他驅迫着思想去犯罪，而犯了罪又沒狡猾的本能去抵賴，市儈的道德去虛飾，而原始的忠誠却毫不容情地　嚙着他們的良心。於是，就立不牢生的崗位，陷落下去了。</p>
<p>小八子一手挾着細小的絨綫杉兒，一手包着半升米，經過熟悉的垃圾桶，不免向它投留戀的一眼，然而映在他眼裏的祇是魚的骷髏，枯的菜根，破布，腐紙。皺一下眉兒，掛着發的愁臉，折向另一條路去，這條路在他的意識裏已經留下個不可磨滅的印象，牠發散着吸引的力，幾平是無意識裏小八子往往就落進這一條路。現在待他冉發現已經走進了這條路，更强烈的欲望要他再往裏邊走。欲望充滿了懺悔，這幾天就老是難爲着他。</p>
<p>不慣於犯罪的人而犯了罪，要工作的人沒有工作，這種痛苦足够顚倒時代，搗破健全人平靜的心境。往昔小八子雖然辛苦，然而並不受良心的譴責，得以保全正常的健康。然而，這幾天，由於內外的夾攻，心的機能由於過度的應用，有時就特別敏銳，有時却特別矛盾，甚致於在千鈞一髮的「刧掠」關頭，還是跬　不移。然而，他從曾想到這是危險，危險在他看來本來是他們的義務。他唯一的心願是能在別的地方謀生的出路，脫離惡劣的現生活的套圈。然這顯得並不容易，永遠他苦腦着這點。</p>
<p>在冬的柔日下，他的影子拖得老長。出乎他意料，他的昨天「幹」下來的絨線衫還飄揚在金色「提莊」招牌之前。而且，還標着觸目驚心的價目，「六十元」這使他木然了，他竊取了人家六十元的財產而自己却以六元的代價來載負全部犯惡的聲名，剩下的讓安坐在皮靠椅裏的老爺們來享受。他曾經眼看着爲了他的刦掠而失去了靈魄的父親的苦痛也到了他們「叫魂」的聲音的悽戾。</p>
<p>「白炭啊！回家啦跟媽的回家去……屋裏去啦」……「嗯來啦」慌忙的做母親的歇斯底里亞的姿勢以及有宏壯的聲音幌着腦袋的父親。這一些沒時沒刻地不傷斵着他的心。他時時好像走入了那顫抖的空氣裏，在那時周遭是糢糊的黑暗。一隻巨大的手覆蓋着小得不稱「叫魂」的樣的燈籠。當他們有着愉快的臉懷着希望的心踅回家去的時候，懷中的垃圾，就眞的像帶了個輕　糧細的靈魄。那時候，他們臉眞像他們已經分負了第三顆靈魄，靈魄眞是這麼輕臘的東西！</p>
<p>他不能再多想了。他似乎看見一張要漲破喉嚨的小哭臉　進他的胸裏，牠時時指使他一些行動，他想漲破喉嚨地痛哭一陣訴出他自己吃去了小東西的靈魂，訴出小東西的恐怖與掠刦的罪惡……他眞恨不得全數還了小東西的一切，然而他的靈魂——靈魂——靈魂——。</p>
<p>這一夜，在風雨的怒號裏，西風將地上的沙子煉成堅實的三角形，橫截過這破的街角的建築又復放出飾煤似的響聲。黑壓壓的街道隱約的顯出兩張虔誠的臉，女的折散了長長的髮把，讓紙箔的過火熖穿這叢叢髮朴，男的用純湖北的口聲喊出：</p>
<p>「小八子來　——你來　」</p>
<p>然而却好像是「小八子—</p>
<p>誰殺，誰殺你——」</p>
<p>冷滑而發抖的街道上，細雨激打着。他强制着紙箔向上的生命力使牠下陷——下陷。</p>

<p>— 方瓊</p>
<p>跨進這一座充滿使人發昏的浪漫氣息的都市，已經有四個年頭了，這許多日子裏天天過着緊凑的時間，排遣掉了幾千個難忘的黃昏。</p>
<p>幾千個黃昏隨着數年來社會環境，生活激盪開始在顚簸，在翻筋斗；度過了多少不同的歡樂的美麗的黃昏，但是究竟數不淸有多少困苦哀愁的夜晚，叫我忍受難挨；祇覺得日子一天比一天過得緊張，有時候竟會覺得整個人生落在生沽的深淵里，摸不到邊際，抓不住崖岸……</p>
<p>從小就頑强地向異鄉流浪，我佔有了一副堅硬的心腸。這一次，在連天的烽火底下，我被刮到了上海（起始自然是逃亡來的），當時我向自己說</p>
<p>「吃慣了樹皮和草根的口，現在是準備要來學習吸取灰塵與煤屑了啊！」</p>
<p>但是我始終依戀了上海是個文化策源地這一點，於是任憑生活問題帶給我多少的危難，我拒絕了家裏一次次向我引誘性的招手，我倔强地像蹲在洞裏的士潑鼠一樣，孤獨地過活下去。</p>
<p>於是日子展開到了目前，</p>
<p>我珍惜地愛護着我的每一個黃昏。白天，從早八點鐘，一直到晚上八點鐘，我給自己的求知慾以及生活問題做了個充分的解決，於是一整天，排緊了我所有的十二小時，敎書，讀書，晚上再敎書。每晚，不管是西北風緊吹着的晚上，或者大雨滂沱的晚上，在鬧市底漫沿，我尋着那靜寂的街頭，在黃昏的燈光下面踏着讓我自己聽得見的我自己的足音，拖着疲倦的身子，回到了家裏，開始度我的黃昏。</p>
<p>我把所有的私事，大大小小的都留在黃昏來料理。屋子裏寂寥得很，我開始拆閱了從遼遠的故鄉的家書；年邁的父母含怨地向我訴說着家鄉情况，也娓娓地可嚀着他們的孩子；這樣我重又記起了姻霧里的故鄉，一長列幽靜的畫面掠過心頭，似乎多少種喧嚷着叨叨絮絮的聲音向我襲來；猛然我又看見了父親捋着麥芒般的鬍髭，在向我說着：</p>
<p>「孩子，回來吧！土地就是黃金呵！」</p>
<p>父母疼着他們的孩子，但是他們不懂得孩子們的心，不明白爲什麼孩子們願意離開了自已寸寸黃金的土地，終日在外流浪，奔跑，却沒有一聲訴苦，沒有一句怨恨，即使窮得朝不謀夕的挨着飢餓。</p>
<p>「既然窮得這麼厲害，回家去住一些時候不好嗎？」</p>
<p>但是我默然地搖着頭。</p>
<p>「這種時候回家坐坐的人多得很，在家裏總比一個人在外頭强。」</p>
<p>我還是向關心我的人笑了一笑。</p>
<p>事實上，我每天能維持一頓中飯而已。在漫長的黃昏裏，我是有豔福聞着街頭巷尾飄過來的米飯香，那飯粒的甜味，使我鼻孔張開，臉上的皺紋也伸直了；饑餓的肚子向我攻擊得那麼兇狠，肚腸和肚腸擠得貼緊，但是我警告着自己：</p>
<p>「多少人和我受着同樣遭遇的呀”否則靈魂的貧乏將使你……」</p>
<p>於是我昂着頭，含着笑，放着胆，繼續度我自己的優美的黃昏。</p>
<p>我珍惜地愛護着我每一寸黃昏裏的時間。我不會忘記我案頭那一部份書在等我，我喜悅地讀完每天規定的頁數，我就覺得自己輕鬆地好像飽餐了一頓晚宴；完成了我艱苦地留在上海的任務的一部份。我自己知道，我們人類活着的意義就在這裏，只要細胞還活動，我要求工作的意志永不褪色的；生活只有這樣的生活，使我不畏懼地努力發展開去。</p>
<p>「雄雞要找高竿棲，大船要找闊海行，女人要找的是平安而能享受的生活。」</p>
<p>朋友在我前前後後，向我指指點點的談論着，她們責駡，我不會找幾個有錢的男朋友，可以在燈紅酒綠的舞榭中度甜美的黃昏；甚至她們還憐惜似的敎導我怎樣在黃昏裏嫵媚的在男性中周旋；但是我告訴他們，我不怕物質上的困苦。</p>
<p>我知道，這些黃昏裏，我有和他們不同的收穫。我在計劃儲藏五年的糧食—這原是我堆聚了每一個倍嘗艱辛的黃昏的果實！</p>
<p>把規定的書本讀完以後，我站起來鬆一口氣，急忽忽的在房裏兜了兩個圈子。房子是那樣小，這兩個圈子好像一根鑰匙在鎖孔裏轉了兩轉似的；我重又坐在桌子前面開始檢討我一天來的工作。</p>
<p>在白天，太陽燃燒着我，像陶工燒着陶器一樣，給我以顏色，聲音，硬性；在黃昏，這是一串陰暗的黑影，幽靜地，我一次又一次，剝掉了自己的皮，透過靈魂的深處，我檢查着目己存留的一些腐蝕的卷戀，這些腐蝕的哀惜，要是在我心裏成長，會帶給我慍鬱和哀愁，冷徹我的心，我須要的是白般堅靱，摒棄一切滓渣，，因此在一次又一次削掉我的皮之後，每一次我都長出一層新皮來。</p>
<p>我判斷了許多心思，這些心思，又多又長，好像草原裏面的路一樣，於是我的黃昏輕易地排遣了過去。</p>
<p>每個黃昏，我向自己警惕着。</p>
<p>「光陰的流逝那樣地迅速，當你不曾把握着這一個黃昏而準備有所作爲的時候，黃昏又過去了。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Wartime Life and Thrift <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"Those whose lives are consistent with war are strong, those who are separate are weak, and those who are opposed perish." We can prove the correctness of this sentence by reading both Chinese and foreign history. For example, in the ancient Roman Empire, during times of peace, the general life of the people was decadent and romantic, arrogant and licentious, so they soon tended to destruction. Ordinary times are like this, let alone in wartime? On the contrary, for example, Japan, sixty or seventy years ago, when the aggressive forces of Europe and the United States knocked on the door, internal and external troubles were no less than those of China in the past ten years. However, because the lives of the people of the whole country were revitalized and everyone knew how to love the country, in a few decades, it leaped to become a world power. Also, like Germany, when it failed in the First World War, it was divided and oppressed by foreign powers, and there were party struggles and revolutions internally. However, because the people worked hard and lived a tense and serious life, it rose again to dominate Europe in twenty years. Looking at the history of our country, there are also many facts that show the spirit of wartime life. The most obvious examples are Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty transporting bricks morning and evening and Zu Ti dancing with chickens at dawn, which were all manifestations of revitalizing one's own life during national crisis. Now that we have declared war on Britain and the United States for more than two months, our daily life should fully reflect the characteristics of wartime, learn from the hard work and patriotism of the modern Japanese and German people, increase production on the one hand, and save consumption on the other. Speaking of increasing production, our first step must be to achieve self-sufficiency in daily necessities, and the second step must be to enrich materials and supply the needs of combat. As for saving consumption, it is to save materials and keep them for national use. The Chinese nation was originally a diligent and thrifty nation. Being diligent can increase production, and being thrifty can naturally save consumption. Working hard in one's own position as a producer is diligence, and saving one's own life as a consumer is thrift. It is not a difficult task to move Mount Tai across the North Sea, nor is it something that heroes and heroes can do. It is a plain and glorious thing that every ordinary citizen can do. The true meaning of wartime life is nothing more than this. If you are not diligent or thrifty, taking ease as glory and spending money to maintain face, you are an unfilial son or daughter of the nation, and you will certainly be uneasy in your own conscience. Moreover, at this time when friendly countries respect us especially, seeing that our life after participating in the war is not a wartime life, the result will also affect their feelings. Therefore, each of us must not think that our personal life will not affect the entire nation, but must recognize the great significance of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." The ancients said: "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." Today, we should all ask ourselves, is my heart dead? As long as the people's hearts are not dead, then everyone can see the glorious and bright future of our Chinese nation, restore the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence, cheer up, practice wartime life, encourage and warn each other, then not only can we be ashamed of the country and friendly countries today, but also in the future we can show great righteousness and leave glory to our children and grandchildren.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Wang Returned to Nanjing from Guangdong Yesterday After Completing Inspection of Military and Political Affairs in South China; Published Announcement Before Leaving Guangzhou <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang of the National Government, accompanied by Military Training Director Ye Peng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chen Chunpu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang, and military advisors Major General Teraoka, Colonel Saito, Tanaka Naka Kamus, and others, flew to Guangzhou on the 22nd of this month to inspect the military and political situation in South China after the war, and inspected the military police and youth groups in Guangdong. He expressed his deep appreciation for the organization and training of the army and youth, and the good results of the work-study schools. The inspection has now been completed, and at 1:20 pm on the 28th, he took a plane back to the capital. At that time, the heads of various ministries and councils of the National Government, and the diplomatic envoys of various countries, were all at the airport to welcome him.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang specially published an announcement before leaving Guangdong, which is recorded as follows: Since July 7th of the 28th year, Zhaoming must go to Guangzhou once a year. This is the fifth time. Every time I go to Guangzhou, what I hear and see always feels like a step forward. This is thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries overseas, so that the comrades in the province can devote themselves and achieve this result. In addition to the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries overseas, the comrades in the province have made progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. Zhaoming will never forget this. The people in Guangdong of friendly countries and the authorities have the same aspirations and work together. Zhaoming will never forget this either. Every time Zhaoming goes to Guangzhou, seeing the elementary school students of friendly countries holding national flags, and the elementary school students of our country holding national flags, standing side by side on the road, intertwined and winding, he is always moved to tears. This time, he was able to personally hear the spirit of love and unity between the Chinese and Japanese people from the various performances of the kindergarten, national school, and senior girls' school students of friendly countries, as well as the residents in Guangdong. He felt even more pleased. When China participated in the war this time, it never failed to consider its weak national strength, how much it could contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and how much it could cooperate with friendly countries. However, inheriting the legacy of Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, he felt that China would one day be able to stand on the same front with friendly Japan, seeking common sweetness in common suffering, and seeking common life in common death. From the perspective of the Chinese and East Asians, it is really reassuring. Guangdong is the birthplace of the Father of the Nation, and it is also close to Hong Kong. Compatriots engaged in industry and commerce in Nanyang and the Americas have deeply tasted the poison of British and American colonialism and recognized Pan-Asianism. Their enthusiasm for participating in the Greater East Asia War should be even deeper than that of ordinary people. Zhaoming, thinking of his elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts in his hometown, is even more determined to complete the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia with the spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work. He is reluctant to leave and has endless words to say. Wang Zhaoming, March 26th, 32nd year.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Guangdong Provincial Government recently issued a bulletin stating that Chairman Wang of the National Government received a warm welcome from officials, civilians, the authorities of friendly countries stationed in Guangdong, and all Japanese expatriates during his inspection in Guangdong. During his stay in Guangdong, in addition to having various social events with the authorities of friendly countries, the Chairman gave instructions to the cadres of the province's party, government, military, police, and students, held cordial talks with responsible comrades from all parties in Guangdong Province, listened to reports from all parties, inspected the army, navy, police, and youth groups, visited Guangdong University, the new campus of Mingsong School, and the work-study school, and attended the welcoming ceremony for residents of friendly countries. The Chairman deeply appreciated the progress made in the province's party affairs, politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and youth group training in recent years. In particular, he was even more grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of the authorities of friendly countries. At the welcoming ceremony for residents of friendly countries, the Chairman witnessed and heard the various performances of students and expatriates from friendly countries, which fully demonstrated the spirit of love and unity between the people of China and Japan. He was deeply moved. The Chairman believed that Guangdong was the source of the revolution, and that a large number of compatriots were doing business in various overseas regions. Their opposition to British and American colonialism and their enthusiasm for practicing Pan-Asianism and participating in the Greater East Asia War were deeper than those of ordinary compatriots.

<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the incident, the purpose of the Japanese military authorities managing factories in various places has been to ensure that various industries continue to produce and do not stagnate. This is a necessary measure. Since the National Government returned to the capital, the authorities of friendly countries have repeatedly returned military-managed factories. After the National Government participated in the war, friendly countries recently transferred a large number of British and American enemy factories. Now, they are returning the remaining twenty-four military-managed factories in various places for the last time. Their intention is undoubtedly to assist the National Government in enhancing its combat power and making China a powerful member of the Greater East Asia War. We should deeply understand the good intentions of friendly countries and work hard ourselves. After the incident, the Japanese military managed a total of 140 Chinese factories in Central China. Their distribution area included 82 factories near Shanghai, 2 in Zhenjiang, 1 in Jiading, 2 in Jiangyin, 2 in Chongming, 1 in Taicang, 4 in Nanjing, 2 in Suzhou, 2 in Wuhu, 1 in Haimen, 7 in Wuxi, 2 in Jiaxing, 7 in Nantong, 1 in Qidong, and 3 in other places. There were 67 textile factories and 73 general factories. All military-managed factories in various places have been returned in 12 batches since 1940. The return dates of the previous eleven batches are recorded as follows: First time, October 31, 1940; Second time, November 20, 1940; Third time, February 28, 1941; Fourth time, May 31, 1941; Fifth time, July 31, 1941; Sixth time, October 31, 1941; Seventh time, May 9, 1942; Eighth time, August 13, 1942; Ninth time, October 10, 1942; Tenth time, November 8, 1942; Eleventh time, January 14, 1943.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government returned to the capital, in order to fulfill the spirit of the treaty and based on the principle of economic cooperation, to assist the rise of industry in our country, more than 100 military-managed factories have been successively returned. It is learned that the friendly country, in view of the fact that our country is currently participating in the Greater East Asia War with all its strength and can make the greatest contribution in economy, has decided to return all twenty-four factories, including the unresolved Shenxin Yarn Factory, to our country for management on the occasion of the third anniversary of the return to the capital. This move will make a great contribution to the National Government's revival of industry, speeding up production, and completing the great cause of wartime economic policy. It can also prove the intention of the authorities of friendly countries to assist the revival of industry in our country. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry and the authorities of the Japanese Embassy have made important statements on this fact, which are explored below.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Statement by Minister Mei <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Since the occurrence of this incident, not only have most of the factories operated by Chinese people been destroyed by artillery fire, but also the factories invested by friendly countries in our country have been severely damaged. Fortunately, the Japanese military authorities have worked hard to restore them, and have protected and managed the remaining factories in our country, so that production has gradually recovered. After the return of the National Government, the Japanese military authorities, based on the principle of economic cooperation, declared their intention to return them. After joint handling by both parties, more than 100 factories have been returned in batches since the process began, which is unexpectedly smooth. This is a good proof of the good intentions of the authorities of friendly countries to assist the revival of our country's factories. Now that the National Government is participating in the Greater East Asia War with the strength of the whole country, it is especially hoped that it will make the greatest contribution in economy, and the friendly countries will also fully support the National Government's war and economic policies. There have been various factual manifestations that are visible to all. This time, the authorities of the Embassy of Friendly Countries in China have once again specially declared on the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital that they have decided to return the following twenty-four unresolved factories. After receiving the news, I am extremely grateful and pleased. I hope that the industrial circles of our country will cherish themselves and work hard, and should follow the example of friendly countries that are advancing industry and work hard to produce in order to contribute to the war and ensure victory.</p>

<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that the remarks made by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies to "Life Magazine" in New York have confirmed Britain and America's willingness to concede Europe to the Soviet Union. Davies's remarks should be carefully noted. Although Davies tried to dispel doubts that the Soviet Union's war aims included annexing the Netherlands, the Baltic states, Poland, Bessarabia, and Tartary, the Soviet Union must achieve this goal before it can be satisfied and before it can show faith in Britain and America. We believe that the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Annapolis is of no great significance.</p>

<p>This time, the Japanese army carried out a spring offensive in Central China, giving a devastating blow to the Chongqing army in the Sixth War Zone (Hubei Front), the Ninth War Zone (around Nanchang), and the Lu-Su War Zone (Su-Huai Front). However, the Chongqing army is now an integral part of the anti-Axis forces and dares to continue its stubborn resistance. Each war zone has become the foundation of regional defense, and its command organization is: Army Group - Army - Division. Here is an overview of the composition and deployment of each war zone:</p>
<p>(First War Zone) Located in northern Shanxi Province, the commander-in-chief is Yan Xishan, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Yang Aiyuan.</p>
<p>(Third War Zone) Centered on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line, it is distributed in the provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign last May, it suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is Gu Zhutong, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Tang Shizun.</p>
<p>(Fourth War Zone) Located in Guangxi Province, the commander-in-chief is Zhang Fakui. After the Japanese army moved into the French concession in Guangzhou Bay, Zhang was appointed as the commander of the forward troops to plot an invasion of the area. This attempt has been thwarted.</p>
<p>(Fifth War Zone) Distributed in southern Henan Province, northern Hubei Province, and western Anhui Province. The commander-in-chief is Li Zongren, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Sun Lianzhong.</p>
<p>(Sixth War Zone) Located in western Hubei Province, it controls the Yangtze River and guards the front door of Chongqing. The commander-in-chief is Chen Cheng, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Wu Qiwai. Although Chen Cheng has clamored to retake Yichang, he has suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army in Central China.</p>
<p>(Seventh War Zone) Located in Guangdong Province, the commander-in-chief is Yu Hanmou. After the Japanese army moved into Guangzhou, the remaining troops around the war zone were swept away.</p>
<p>(Eighth War Zone) Spans the three northwestern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. The commander-in-chief is Zhu Shaoliang, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Fu Zuoyi.</p>
<p>(Ninth War Zone) Distributed in the provinces of Jiangxi and Hunan. The commander-in-chief is Xue Yue, and the deputy commander-in-chief is Yang Sen.</p>
<p>In addition, it is rumored that a Tenth War Zone was established in Yunnan Province at the end of last year, with Guan Linzheng as the commander, but the details are not known. In addition to the above, there are also two special war zones as follows:</p>
<p>(Lu-Su Special War Zone) Operates in the original areas between Shandong and Jiangsu provinces occupied by the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is Yu Xuezhong, and the deputy commander is Han Deqin. Since the generals Wu Huawen, Li Wen, and Li Yongping joined the National Government one after another, the strength of this war zone has declined significantly.</p>
<p>(Ji-Cha Special War Zone) This also operates in the Hebei and Chahar areas under Japanese occupation. They can only barely maintain their existence while avoiding the eyes of the Japanese army. The commander-in-chief is concurrently held by Jiang Wen, the commander of the First War Zone, and the deputy commander is Pang Bingxun.</p>
<p>There are also two guerrilla-style border areas of Henan-Shandong-Jiangsu-Anhui. The former is commanded by Tang Enbo, spanning the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui; the latter is commanded by Wang Zhonglian, operating between Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Both forces are insignificant. Secondly, the Eighteenth Group Army, commanded by Zhu De and deputy commander Peng Dehuai, consists of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region (Commander Nie Rongzhen, in Shanxi, Chahar, and Hebei), the Lu-Ji-Yu Border Region (Commander Xu Xiangqian, in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan), the Northwest Shanxi Military Region (Commander He Long, in northwestern Shanxi Province), and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region (Commander Liu Bocheng, in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan). Most of them nest in the North China region. (Ding: Translated from the March 18th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Second Phase of the Battle in Central and Southern Tunisia Begins: German-Italian Allied Forces Launch Fierce Attack on the Front Line <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that there are still defensive military operations in Tunisia. Although the enemy is numerous, they failed to achieve a decisive victory yesterday. The enemy attempting to invade was repelled by German and Italian forces. The Axis counter-attack drove the enemy back to their original positions. German bomber groups attacked a convoy near Algiers, hitting several enemy merchant ships.</p>
<p>Rome, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - An Italian military headquarters communiqué today stated that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are currently resisting a new Allied offensive. Italian torpedo planes heavily damaged Allied transport ships off the coast of Algiers and sank three ships, totaling 32,000 tons. The Italian army achieved a triumphant victory. The three ships totaled 15,000 tons, 10,000 tons, and 7,000 tons. Another ship in the distance was on fire. German aircraft heavily damaged an enemy ship in the western Mediterranean and hit four medium-sized ships with torpedoes, one of which sank during the day.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The German and Italian Allied forces on the Tunisian front launched a fierce attack with powerful units the day before yesterday. The second phase of the great battle in central and southern Tunisia has already begun. The enemy seems to be maintaining its original offensive plan: (1) A frontal attack on the Mareth Line, while special units bypass the right flank. This task is undertaken by the British Eighth Army. (2) Advancing eastward from the Gafsa area towards the coast, in order to encircle the Axis forces. The U.S. Fifth Army is the main force there, assisted by British and French forces. The enemy implemented this plan and launched attacks in several places, all of which were repelled. Fierce battles took place at that time. The enemy's strength is clearly very sufficient.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest Axis war report from Tunisia, battles are currently underway on the central and southern fronts. All attacks on the Mareth Line by the British Eighth Army have been repelled. The British army has suffered heavy losses. The American radio station in Algiers said that fierce fighting is still taking place on the outskirts of the Mareth Line. The British Eighth Army is advancing slowly, but every step requires a hard fight. The Allied war report from North Africa only stated that the Eighth Army is advancing towards the Axis defensive positions. U.S. infantry has launched an attack on Fudou in central Tunisia. According to the U.S. military report from the Maknassi area, the U.S. military's eastward advance has been blocked by German troops controlling the high ground. In the Gafsa area, especially the El Guettar area, the initial Axis war report stated that the lines of communication between the U.S. military and its main force have been cut off, presenting a state of "uneasy silence." The ground has become hard under the increasingly intense sunlight. The troops have brought tropical equipment. On the northern front, the Allied forces claimed that there was skirmishing near the Axis front line a few miles northeast of Métouia-El Bab. Skirmishing was particularly intense south of the Ousseltia Valley. Both sides' air forces are very active. British and American aircraft bombed the Axis positions near El Hamma, which is located behind the Mareth Line. The Allied attempt to bypass the German army from here has been thwarted by strong Axis resistance.

<p>German Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Capture of Shchigry; Only Local Battles Elsewhere; Commander of the Cossack Army Killed in Action</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German military report stated that the city of Shchigry, northwest of Kursk, was finally captured by German forces after several days of street fighting. The Eastern Front was generally quiet yesterday, with only local battles in a few places. German bomber groups hit a large ship near the Lebyazhy Peninsula.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau reported last night that there were no changes in the front line situation. The large-scale German offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front was the first since June of last year. The midnight communiqué stated that there were no changes on any front line after March 27.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The commander of the Cossack army, Lunenkov, who was fighting alongside the German army, has been killed in action on the Eastern Front. He was 50 years old this year. His father, General Lunenkov, served as the commander of the Russian First Army during World War I. The army was defeated by the German Eighth Army, led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes.</p>
<p>Soviet Border Area, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The fighting on the Eastern Front was deadlocked today. Only local battles occurred in the northwest of the Caucasus, on the north bank of the Donets River, and in the central sector. According to Berlin sources, the German army annihilated two Red Army infantry divisions and a tank brigade between Orel and Kursk. Because the Red Army had reinforcements arrive on the front line west of Kursk, they resumed their offensive but were repelled by the German army. The battle situation in each area of the Eastern Front is described as follows: (1) Northwest of the Caucasus, according to Moscow sources, the Red Army under General Maslennikov continued to attack in the Kuban River basin, attempting to reduce the bridgehead. They have already occupied two densely populated areas, and their vanguard has reached 20 miles northeast of Novorossiysk. The Red Army is fighting under "extremely difficult conditions," often attacking while standing in deep water. However, according to Berlin sources, all Red Army offensives have been repelled by the German army. (2) Belgorod Sector, the German army continued to attack the Red Army positions fiercely, breaking through one position, but it was soon repelled by the Red Army to its original position. The German army is advancing in two directions on the upper reaches of the Donets River, attacking the Red Army positions fiercely under the cover of artillery and tanks. The Soviet side has not announced the results. (3) Central Sector, the focus of the battle is still south of Bely. The German army is defending the area near Dorogobuzh, trapping General Konarev's forces. Fierce fighting is also taking place on the Yartsevo front. According to the latest news from Moscow, the position of General Konarev's Red Army near Dorogobuzh has greatly improved. Dorogobuzh is one of the German strongholds on the upper reaches of the Dnieper River, only 45 miles from Smolensk, and the terminal of a branch of the Nikitka railway. It passes through the Vyazma-Smolensk railway in Dorokhovo. However, as early spring arrives, the ice and snow on the ground have begun to melt, making transportation more difficult. The Red Army is advancing slowly in the mud, feeling the hardship of marching and constantly being disturbed by German rear guards. Moreover, the German army has laid mines in various places, making it even more difficult for the Red Army to advance quickly.</p>

<h3 id="e18">The True Nature of Anglo-Saxons (Part 2) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>Let me further discuss the greatest difference between England and Japan. England is a thoroughgoing parliamentary-centered country, while Japan is a thoroughgoing imperial-centered country. England's politics are bottom-up, while Japan's politics are imperial-centered. England's monarchs, though not formally elected by public vote like the United States today, were chosen through discussions among powerful clans, chieftains, and other influential figures, or with their promise of agreement.</p>
<p>England's history, in terms of foreign relations, is a history of being conquered by foreign powers or failing in attempts to conquer certain territories on the continent. In terms of domestic relations, it is a history of power struggles between the king and the people. And by "people," it initially referred to aristocratic landowners, then to middle and small landowners, and then to large capitalists and the middle class who had achieved commercial success, and finally to the general laboring population.</p>
<p>The result of the people's struggle for power with the monarch was the transfer of all political power to Parliament. As for the so-called Parliament, to be precise, it is not the upper house but the lower house, not the House of Lords but the House of Commons. As English history shows, England's Parliament, from the perspective of the land, is a body for collecting taxes. England is based on the idea that the nation is entirely a commercial joint-stock company, the people are its shareholders, and the king is its manager, appointed to protect or increase the interests of the shareholders. Therefore, even the smallest amount, even a penny, cannot be collected without the consent of the shareholders—the people.</p>
<p>"No taxation without representation" is an unwritten law since the founding of England. The American Revolution, though not entirely, was largely derived from this principle.</p>
<p>The English Parliament, with such characteristics, often clashed with the king over its demands. Therefore, the king always tried to minimize expenses as much as possible, avoid doing things as much as possible, and avoid convening Parliament as much as possible. However, when faced with unexpected needs to collect new taxes or restore old taxes that had been abolished, he had no choice but to convene Parliament. Once convened, Parliament gradually expanded its power.</p>
<p>If the king happened to disregard this principle, the people would rise up against the king in revolt. The first English Revolution occurred in this way, and the result was that Charles I became a sacrifice on the guillotine. Because the English Parliament dared to execute the king—although this Parliament had also been threatened by Cromwell's soldiers (the Iron Army)—actions such as deposing or establishing a king were as easy as a shareholders' meeting changing managers, without any obstacles.</p>
<p>The second revolution, which banished James II from England and welcomed William of Orange and Queen Mary from Holland, also demonstrates the power of the English Parliament. Dicey, Albert Venn, a British constitutional scholar, praised the unlimited power of the English Parliament, saying, "There is nothing the English Parliament cannot do, except that it cannot turn a man into a woman or a woman into a man by parliamentary resolution." This is quite true.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the English Parliament, matters such as changing the political system can be proposed by a single member's motion, and their realization is by no means impossible. Even in the mid-Victorian era, Sir Charles Dilke proposed moving the republican system into England. Although that gentleman eventually silenced his eccentric arguments, he served as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the second Gladstone cabinet and wielded considerable influence. It is also not unbelievable that the Queen complained to Gladstone about his position as Under-Secretary.</p>
<p>Such parliamentary centrism dominates England, even today. Baldwin asked Edward VIII whether he would sever his unnatural relationship with Mrs. Simpson or abandon the throne, forcing him to choose between the two. This, needless to say, was because Baldwin, before and after, had a majority of parliamentary members as his party members. Although it was Baldwin who carried out that matter, it can be said that it was Parliament that made it happen.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, parliamentary centrism should never be advocated in Japan. Anyone who advocates it is nothing short of a rebellious subject. However, some people who claim to be loyalists and patriots are actually advocating parliamentary centrism, and the world tolerates it without finding it strange. One must say that they ultimately regard Japan as the England of East Asia, or still hope that Japan will become the England of East Asia.</p>
<p>In short, to completely eliminate the bad habit of worshiping Anglo-Saxons in Japan, it is essential to first understand that the fundamental spirit of Japan and England, in terms of national foundation, is absolutely incompatible. This is the first and foremost requirement.</p>
<p>(III) Evaluation of Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>What exactly are Anglo-Saxons? Historians describe them as:</p>
<p>"White, gigantic bodies, ferocious blue eyes, reddish-golden hair, voracious eaters, fond of drinking, guzzling day and night, without shame."</p>
<p>However, these words only scratch the surface of the Anglo-Saxons. If we dissect and observe these barbaric and animalistic Anglo-Saxons, we can see that they possess characteristics that cannot be easily categorized. Are they foolish? They are very quick-witted. Are they indulgent in pleasure? They are extremely active. Are they extravagant? They are very good at making money. Although their religious sentiment seems very strong, their pirate nature is ingrained in their bones. Although they love animals and are accustomed to walking dogs and playing with horses, they secretly abuse and slaughter them at will, without any pity.</p>
<p>Travelers around the world, even those who only know Japanese, are probably willing to acknowledge the dignified posture of the Anglo-Saxons, their air of overwhelming other nations. Not only do they themselves boast of having superior character, but they can also make other nations, regardless of love or hate, acknowledge their superiority. Even the French, who pride themselves on standing at the highest peak of world culture, write and read books titled "The Superiority of Anglo-Saxons."</p>
<p>Thus, they strut around the world looking down on everything. In fact, they are originally a very quarrelsome people in the world. Whether they are Englishmen from the old country or Americans who are their branch, except for the Jews, they all have the habit of squandering money like dirt. And among the Anglo-Saxons, there are also not a few Jews who are like tigers in donkey skins. They say, "As long as there is money in the world," they enjoy themselves to the fullest in all the winter resorts, summer resorts, hot spring resorts, and all other places of enjoyment in all corners of the world.</p>
<p>Originally, the Englishmen from the old country were a bit more stable, while the Americans from the new country were even more likely to put on the airs of the rich. Their sense of superiority can be explained by the saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans do," but no matter where they are, they always impose their own style, impolitely. Regardless of whether it suits the situation or whether others like it, they always force their goods on others. After all, it is because the consciousness that "the world is ours" exists in their minds.</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly describe the true nature of the Anglo-Saxons and present some evaluations of them. The great English poet Byron said:</p>
<p>"There is no one in the world as hateful as the English. I am very unhappy to be close to them, and if possible, I would like to hate them from afar. Except for hell, I have no place to live with them."</p>
<p>The English have been famous for lying since ancient times. Erasmus said:</p>
<p>"When it comes to the question of truth and falsehood, the English generally have a bad reputation."</p>
<p>Erasmus was a Dutchman, a great scholar of continental Europe, and Oxford University was where he lectured. He would never have had ill feelings towards the English, but he still said such words.</p>
<p>Also, Frederick the Great said:</p>
<p>"The first principle of English politics is to demand everything from its allies, while not contributing a single hair itself."</p>
<p>When the Anglo-Japanese alliance was concluded, if Japanese politicians had known Frederick's words, they would surely have been wary.</p>
<p>In the upper half of the Victorian era, the famous Foreign Secretary Palmerston declared:</p>
<p>"England has no permanent enemies, no permanent allies, but only permanent interests."</p>
<p>What Palmerston meant was that if it was in their interest, they could sell out their allies and shake hands with their enemies. This is the English habit. And this can be understood more than halfway by simply looking at the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, one of the signatories of the American Declaration of Independence and the inventor of the lightning rod, said:</p>
<p>"Probably no nation does not hope for England to be humiliated."</p>
<p>Franklin's Twelve Virtues were his lessons for life. And Franklin, the proclaimer of these Twelve Virtues, actually hoped that England would be humiliated. This is inconsistent with his character. However, it shows how much the English are hated by the world.</p>
<p>Goethe said:</p>
<p>"No matter from which aspect, there is probably no place with as many hypocrites and sanctimonious people as England. No matter which country, there is probably no country as thoroughly dominated by 'my profit, my obsession' as England. No matter which nation, there is probably no nation as devoid of humanity in its political and personal relations as England."</p>
<p>Goethe was by no means a writer who habitually spoke deceptive and provocative words. He was a philosopher with the most complete mind, who had the universe stored in his brain. It was no accident that he said these words. The hypocrisy of the English is truly deeply ingrained. Their so-called "gentleman" is a title of hypocrisy. In their own country—in public view—they behave in a civilized, dignified, courteous, and respectful manner, but once they go abroad, they become unrestrained and indulgent, and their so-called pirate nature is naturally exposed.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of sugar rationing by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative, the second phase of sugar distribution will begin on April 1st. Sugar certificates will be issued starting today. (1) In the Public Concession, they will be issued by the Municipal Council. (2) In the French Concession, they will be issued by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale. (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, etc., they will be issued by the Food Bureau. The method of purchasing sugar with the second phase of sugar certificates, as well as the quantity and price, will be announced by the Cooperative at a later date. It is heard that the distribution of the second phase of sugar certificates has been improved, based on the addresses of the Class A retailers re-registered by the Cooperative. Therefore, certificate holders can purchase nearby from now on. The military authorities have approved 15,000 bags of sugar for distribution in March. The Cooperative has already handled the distribution: (1) to Class A retailers for sugar rationing, (2) to Class B retailers for business purposes. It is also stipulated that the first phase of sugar distribution is from March 11th to 31st. Certificates that are not collected within the time limit will be invalid. Certificate holders are urged to purchase from designated Class A retailers as soon as possible to avoid losing the right to allocation.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Neighborhood Summer Sanitation to be Inspected by Jia Chiefs <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>As summer approaches, attention should be paid to sanitation. Residents casually dumping garbage and relieving themselves in the alleys are unsightly and harmful to public health. The two authorities now entrust the Baojia chiefs to investigate such instances. If garbage is found accumulated within a certain Jia chief's area, the Jia chief will conduct an on-site investigation to find the dumper. If it is a first offense, a fine will be imposed. If it is a repeat offense or if advice is ignored, in addition to the fine, detention may be imposed depending on the circumstances. There are also some petty citizens who, out of stinginess to pay the night soil collectors' tip money and monthly fees, secretly dump their chamber pots into the sewers at night. This is especially reckless of public hygiene and is harmful to the city. To encourage enforcement, the two authorities will reward those who catch someone dumping chamber pots on the spot with half of the fine imposed, to demonstrate encouragement and raise city-wide awareness of sanitation.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Food Bureau began implementing sugar rationing this month, with the aim of generally alleviating the serious threat of sugar scarcity in the city, it has found that retail sugar merchants in the Southern District have failed to comply with the Bureau's regulations and promote the initiative. Numerous violations of laws and regulations have occurred, which is deeply regrettable. The Food Bureau has already issued warnings to the sugar merchants involved in the malfeasance. It has come to light that Taihe Sugar Store, located at 194 Jinjia Lane (金家弄) on Limma Road (裏馬路) in the Southern District, has been selling sugar at 5 yuan (Central Reserve Bank notes) per kilogram under the pretext of converting granulated sugar, exceeding the price limit by a significant 3 jiao per kilogram. Furthermore, they are charging an excessive 4 jiao for packaging. This matter was reported to the Food Bureau by Zhu Guoming (朱國明), a resident of the Southern District. An investigation confirmed the report, and the matter is currently under discussion for punishment. The Bureau expresses its regret that the sugar merchants have failed to comply with the authorities' regulations for the sale of sugar. To effectively rectify the situation, it has drafted a comprehensive plan to eradicate the malpractice.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Readers' Forum: After Reading the Article "Save Electricity" <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xianfeng (胡賢豐)</p>
<p>After reading the short commentary "Save Electricity" in the 23rd's newspaper, I have a deep feeling about the current electricity consumption problem in this port. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the uncertain source of coal and insufficient coal reserves, has had to repeatedly ask electricity users to save electricity. Apart from special and social undertakings (schools, hospitals, etc.), the method of reducing electricity consumption applies to manufacturing factories, entertainment venues, and residences. The former (factories) are cut by about 10%, while the latter (entertainment) are cut by almost 90% or more. Comparing the two, social undertakings are certainly important, but I ask, can factories that seek production be treated the same as ordinary entertainment venues? The importance of factories, even before the war, I believe is very clear to all sectors. Moreover, in the present Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's position in the national wartime economy is at the forefront. The importance of its industry is self-evident. We can take an example at will: Germany, for many years, has never dared to slightly halt the work of domestic factories while campaigning south and north. When male workers are lacking, they are routinely supplemented by women. I remember a national defense expert in a certain country saying, "Only industry can revitalize a country." Since we know the importance of industry and manufacturing, and the urgency of wartime production, why does the electricity company coldly reduce electricity to factories that are working to produce goods?</p>
<p>The above is not a direct view. From a social perspective, factories are unable to work fully due to electricity restrictions. In a month, they often cannot work for half a month. Some factories are even restricted to the point where they cannot start work. Of course, factories are not charitable organizations. Because the power has stopped, workers have no work to do and are heading towards unemployment. Society has another group of people with no livelihood. Isn't this kind of situation easy for discerning people to see?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the original intention of saving electricity is that thrift is a virtue, but we must grasp its center. The entertainment venues in this city are a good example. If I say the opposite, if the method of restricting electricity is applied to thousands of entertainment venues instead of factories, then the entire society will definitely be prosperous, and at least it can save a little for people who are accustomed to enjoying themselves. However, in fact, we only see the opening of theaters, song halls, and art academies every day. Where is the electricity restriction and electricity saving?</p>
<p>I hope that people from all walks of life will put forward their opinions for discussion, and at the same time hope that the electricity company will do its best to dredge the source of coal to the authorities, and give Shanghai factories the minimum convenience for electricity consumption. This would be a great blessing for society and the country! (Reward for Helping Students)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Economic Circle: Shanghai's Financial and Industrial Market Conditions Tend to Be Stable <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that Shanghai's financial and industrial market conditions have become more stable under the strict control of the authorities in the past week. The interbank lending rate is quoted at 16%, and the official prices of commodities such as rice, miscellaneous grains, flour, soap, matches, soybean oil, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth remain unchanged. Trade in all industries is sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Comment: Further Expectations for Trade Associations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>After the authorities promulgated the regulations on trade associations, they also took steps to reorganize various trade associations. This is indeed an urgent task at present and goes without saying. In the era of material control, the most important institutions are the trade associations of various industries. However, due to differing interests among traders, there is often a habit of acting independently and establishing separate banners. Therefore, in the same industry, there can be as many as ten or more associations. The authorities are inconsistent, audits are impossible, and even mutual attacks and private interests are pursued, which is indeed undeniable. Therefore, in the future, for the same industry, it is urgent to stipulate a unified trade association, strictly define the name, and assign several leaders who are fair, honest, and reputable in the industry to be responsible for organizing it. The Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should send personnel to guide and reasonably reorganize it, so that a small number of people or bad elements cannot take control or cause trouble, which would hinder the progress of the association's affairs. It is especially hoped that the government will promulgate various implementing rules as soon as possible in addition to issuing regulations, guide the organizational procedures, so that the reorganization of trade associations has a basis.</p>
<p>At the same time, the General Chamber of Commerce for Material Control and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other institutions, as they are both private commercial institutions, should advocate and supervise the trade associations and should convene the backbone members of various trade associations from time to time to hold symposiums to discuss the rectification of trade association regulations and the promotion of the government's economic program, and must thoroughly eliminate the bad rules and bad habits of various industries. By eliminating corruption and improving customs, the implementation of various policies will naturally be smooth.</p>
<h3 id="e40">The General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control Adjusts Lower-Level Organizations; Unit Associations Will Be Reduced to Below One Hundred <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control, China's autonomous trade control mechanism has been established. On the 25th, the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, which were promulgated on the same day. Therefore, the lower-level organizations are estimated to be fully completed within one month. Regarding the adjustment of lower-level organizations, the General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control has begun to investigate the existing associations and has repeatedly convened the main figures of various associations to discuss specific matters. In short, the focus of the adjustment of lower-level organizations is the extent to which the existing three hundred or more associations will be adjusted and merged. It is heard that the General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control is adopting a policy of awaiting the automatic merger of the business community based on the principle of one trade per association, and the general business community is also quite aware of the situation and has the intention of automatic merger.</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control's policy of adjusting lower-level organizations will minimize the number of unit associations as much as possible, intending to reduce them to below one hundred. It is expected that the joint associations of various industries will not exceed twenty.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Material Control Review Committee has been established, and the Chinese and Japanese representative members have also been decided. The first committee meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on April 1 to discuss the comprehensive demand and supply plan for materials, guide the basic principles of control, etc. At the same time, the movements of Japanese merchants are attracting much attention from the outside world. It seems that the Japanese merchants' adjustment of unit organizations also intends to automatically adjust them based on the principle of one trade per organization. It is generally believed that the Japanese merchants will automatically merge under the guidance of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and be incorporated into the new production and marketing mechanism.

<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai News: The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, is adjusting and reorganizing all old economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime system. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all industrial and commercial organizations in the city, including all federations, joint business offices, trade associations, and other similar organizations that have not been approved for registration, to report to the Bureau for verification. Recently, it has been learned that the various trade organizations are actively registering with the Bureau, which is being handled by the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office of the Second Section of the Bureau. However, the organizations that have not yet completed the registration must complete the registration procedures before April 10. If they fail to register within the deadline, they will be banned in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>The Japanese authorities are scheduled to return the concessions in China on April 1. The relations between China and Japan have entered a new stage of fulfilling promises. In order to adapt to the new situation, enhance the friendship between the two countries, and seek tangible achievements in economic cooperation, in order to complete the holy war, the Japanese government has convened more than 60 people involved in trade, investment, mining, textiles, and other businesses with China that have headquarters or main stores in mainland Japan. An economic roundtable conference is scheduled to be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:30 AM on the 29th to ask representatives from various industries to understand the government's new policies and various administrative measures. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo (東條) and Minister Aoki (靑木) of the Greater East Asia Ministry will first deliver speeches, and then the roundtable conference will begin. The attendees include Prime Minister Tojo, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army and Navy Ministry, relevant officials, and more than 60 people involved in business with China.

<h3 id="e44">Translated Commentary: Stopping the Issuance of New Military Notes and Our Country's Responsibility <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>It is rare to see a special case of organizing military notes paid in military affairs during operations. However, the Greater East Asia War is now progressing step by step, and construction is being carried out on one side, which is the main goal of the current operation. In a country, having two systems of currency circulation, in a situation where their strength basis is different, will of course cause various inconveniences, not only making the unified currency policy encounter difficulties, but also affecting the work of strengthening the allied country of China. After the cessation of the issuance of new military notes, the National Government's currency has gained autonomy. Although the Central Reserve Bank notes can already unify China's currency, Japan's responsibility has not been lessened. The responsibility for supporting the Central Reserve Bank notes will be even greater in the future. In order to maintain the value of the currency, there are two indispensable conditions behind it: that is, the existence of productivity and materials. Therefore, it is necessary to increase production separately in various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and seek to communicate the exchange of materials in various places. This is the principle of maintaining the value of the currency and making Greater East Asia a truly co-prosperous sphere. Japan has never spared assistance to the National Government in terms of materials and funds, and will continue to make the greatest efforts in the future. Although military notes have established brilliant achievements in defeating the old legal currency in the past, we must know that the currency war will never end here, and further struggles are still ahead.

<h3 id="e45">The Reconstruction of Shanghai's Literary Scene <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Zhi (靑之)</p>
<p>From the Sino-Japanese Incident to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai was called an "isolated island." The relationship between this "isolated island" and the Shanghai literary scene is like the relationship between a "greenhouse" in the wilderness and the flowers in the greenhouse. Therefore, at that time, no matter how full of struggle or how beautiful and lively it was, it was just a flower in a greenhouse. When the sound of gunfire rang out and the special nature of the isolated island disappeared, all of this became the past at the same time.</p>
<p>There are still many literary authors who either yearn for the past, or are decadent, or change careers, or are passively silent, etc. This is all very regrettable on the road to rebuilding the Shanghai literary scene.</p>
<p>The strength of the vitality of a flower blooming in a greenhouse needs to be tested by putting it outside. Similarly, whether Shanghai, which has lost the special nature of the "isolated island," can re-establish a brilliant cultural foundation depends on whether Shanghai cultural people have strong personalities. The past will never return. The special nature of the "isolated island" will not only never return, but the remnants will soon be completely cleared. The reconstruction of the Shanghai literary scene must recognize this reality, and then actively work to build the foundation for tomorrow, and on this basis, raise our literary banner.</p>
<h3 id="e46">One in the Window <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Kai (陳楷)</p>
<p>On a quiet road, there are very few vehicles passing by at this time when the sun is about to set. There are also very few customers in the shops on both sides, and they are all lifeless and without any vitality. The setting sun shines on the dusty windows of the shops on the left, seeming very dry. In the middle of that row of shops, there is a second-hand shop. Because the things sold are old and the windows are not cleaned, they are dirty and full of all kinds of things, and they are very messy. Among them, there is a violin hanging alone, playing a sad and indignant tune. We can very well hear that it is extremely disgusted with the world. At the same time, there is also a steel pen, standing firm and upright, with an indomitable expression. It seems very surprised to hear the violin's solo, and soon, it finally can't bear to want to stop the violin:</p>
<p>"Why do you play that kind of sad and indignant tone? The world needs us to constantly work hard to transform it. We are temporarily resting here now. Why should we worry ourselves? "</p>
<p>When the violin heard him say this, he stopped and replied to him:</p>
<p>"I don't want to live anymore. The world is full of cunning and cruelty, and there is no justice at all. What is there to stay in such a world? I can't bear it anymore. I can't live in such a world anymore. I hate everything, and I hate myself. I will break my heartstrings and shout out my throat. Please don't stop me. That is what I am willing to do and happy about."</p>
<p>The steel pen could not bear it anymore, and he shouted out:</p>
<p>"Who said there is no justice in the world, but it is hidden. As long as you go to find it, you will find it. But you are sad and indignant and don't want to get close to it, then you will never find it. As long as we work hard to break all the darkness and remove the sadness in our hearts, justice will be in front of our eyes. Look at the great figures of all ages! They have strong self-confidence and perseverance, and they have overcome any dangerous obstacles. They have succeeded, found the truth, discovered justice, and found happiness for mankind. Just like my former master used me to write non-stop, writing for the justice of mankind, until the moment he died, are there no justice in those books? Think about the happiness we have gained through struggle! Don't curse the world like that anymore! The world is beautiful and lovely! It's a pity you haven't discovered it."</p>
<p>The violin seemed to be thinking about the beautiful pastoral land that came from struggle. It emitted a quiet and pleasant tone. When we listened, it seemed that we had arrived at a vast land, with dense forests lined up on both sides. It seemed that the sky was already night, and the moon was slowly rising! At that end, there was a cottage in front of which was a pastoral land. That was such a beautiful and peaceful place! There was no cunning, only kindness and peace. Several people appeared in that place, and they were all working in harmony, without any looting. The violin seemed to gradually find it lovely and reluctant to give it up. Suddenly, it stopped its singing and said to itself:</p>
<p>"That is a fantasy, a fantasy, a fantasy that will never exist."</p>
<p>However, the steel pen said very confidently:</p>
<p>"All the strong and fierce events are entirely caused by demons. If we eliminate the demons, can't we get that beautiful and peaceful place? We have to work hard to find it ourselves. Now listen to me sing, so that we will no longer be discouraged."</p>
<p>So the steel pen raised his powerful throat and sang majestically:</p>
<p>"We are young, we are young,</p>
<p>We have hot hearts, and strength</p>
<p>We have the ability to work——</p>
<p>To create human happiness.</p>
<p>We have compassionate hearts to influence everything,</p>
<p>To create human justice,</p>
<p>To find the truth of mankind.</p>
<p>We have an indomitable spirit to destroy darkness,</p>
<p>To break the cunning thoughts of mankind,</p>
<p>To eliminate the cruel spirit of mankind.</p>
<p>We are young, we are young,</p>
<p>We have boiling blood, and useful brains,</p>
<p>We have the ability to work constantly</p>
<p>To make the world bright."</p>
<p>The violin was immersed in this majestic singing, and it seemed to be gradually awakening.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Soul <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Song Lian</p>
<p>The price of white coal has risen again.</p>
<p>October 1942 was the peak period for the prosperity of white coal. In cities where it's impossible to save on heat, this is of course a temporary trend that can be eased. However, for the pot-bellied gentlemen, besides seeing it as a way to make money, a fake frown is already considered the pinnacle of sympathy.</p>
<p>However, "after a great war, there will surely be a great epidemic." Those friends who live on salaries and calculate every penny, and those outsiders who make a living by scavenging coal dust, have to become victims of this man-made disaster.</p>
<p>Misfortune finally struck this group of people. In the faint morning light, along with the rumbling sound of the night soil carts, one could no longer hear the cheerful sound of sifting coal, or the father's commands pointing this way and that. In the struggle for survival, diligence has lost its due power, deviating from the laws of life—</p>
<p>A group of souls with a spirit for work but without work opportunities are idle all day long, idle. However, the demon of hunger is, after all, terrifying. It drives thoughts to commit crimes, and having committed crimes, they lack the cunning instinct to deny it, the morality of merchants to feign innocence, while their original loyalty ruthlessly gnaws at their conscience. Thus, they cannot stand firm in the position of life and fall down.</p>
<p>Little Ba-zi, with a small woolen sweater under one arm and half a liter of rice in the other, passes by a familiar trash can, unable to resist casting a nostalgic glance at it. However, what is reflected in his eyes are only fish skeletons, withered vegetable roots, rags, and rotten paper. Frowning slightly, with a face full of worry, he turns to another path. This path has left an indelible impression in his mind, radiating an attractive force. Almost unconsciously, Little Ba-zi often falls into this path. Now that he has realized that he has already entered this path, an even stronger desire urges him to go further inside. Desire is filled with repentance, which has been troubling him these past few days.</p>
<p>Committing crimes for those not accustomed to it, and having no work for those who want to work—this kind of pain is enough to overturn an era, disrupting the peaceful state of mind of healthy people. In the past, although Little Ba-zi worked hard, he did not suffer the condemnation of his conscience and was able to maintain normal health. However, these past few days, due to the internal and external attacks, the function of his heart, due to excessive use, is sometimes particularly sensitive, and sometimes particularly contradictory, even to the point that at the critical moment of "robbery," he remains hesitant. However, he never thought that this was dangerous. Danger, in his view, was originally their duty. His only wish is to find a way to make a living elsewhere, to escape the vicious cycle of his current life. But this seems not easy, and he is always troubled by this point.</p>
<p>Under the gentle winter sun, his shadow is drawn out long. Unexpectedly, the woolen sweater he "did" yesterday is still fluttering in front of the golden "Pawnshop" sign. Moreover, it is marked with an eye-catching price: "Sixty Yuan." This makes him numb. He stole sixty yuan of someone else's property, but he bears the full infamy of committing a crime for the price of six yuan, leaving the rest for the old gentlemen sitting comfortably in leather armchairs to enjoy. He had witnessed the pain of his father, who lost his spirit because of his robbery, and even the shrillness of their voices when "calling back the soul."</p>
<p>"White Coal! Come home, come home with Mom... Go inside the house..." "Okay, I'm coming!" The hurried, hysterical gestures of the mother and the father shaking his head with a loud voice. All of this constantly wounds his heart. He always feels like he is walking into that trembling air, where everything around is a blurry darkness. A huge hand covers a lantern that is so small it doesn't look like it's "calling back the soul." When they have happy faces and hopeful hearts as they hurry home, the trash in their arms really feels like carrying a light, slender spirit. At that time, their faces really look like they have shared the third soul. The soul is really such a light thing!</p>
<p>He can't think anymore. He seems to see a small crying face about to burst his throat getting into his chest, constantly directing his actions. He wants to cry out loud, to confess that he has eaten the soul of the little thing, to confess the terror and the sin of robbery... He really wishes he could return everything to the little thing, but his soul—soul—soul—.</p>
<p>That night, in the roaring wind and rain, the west wind turned the sand on the ground into solid triangles, and the dilapidated street corner building emitted sounds like a coal stove again. In the pitch-black street, two pious faces vaguely appear. The woman scatters her long hair, letting the flames of the burning paper money pierce through the thick hair. The man shouts in pure Hubei dialect:</p>
<p>"Little Ba-zi, come back—come back—"</p>
<p>But it seems like "Little Ba-zi—</p>
<p>Who killed you, who killed you—"</p>
<p>On the cold, slippery, and trembling street, the fine rain is beating down. He forces the upward vitality of the paper money, making it sink—sink.</p>

<p>Ears should grow in the middle, so that "honest advice is not unpleasant to the ear," and only one is needed, so that it can only enter and not exit, and will not be ignored!</p>
<p>Eyes should be larger, so that one will not "have no one in sight." The eyebrows should be removed to avoid flirtatious glances and create many love affairs!</p>
<p>Two mouths should grow, suitable for "distributing grain by head." No teeth should grow, so one can eat and say less. If one cannot chew rice, one can drink porridge!</p>
<p>Two pairs of nostrils should grow, to avoid "relying on others' breath," and also to eat more air. Even if one is ridiculed by others, one will never burst one's stomach!</p>

<p>Listen, on the roaring sea—</p>
<p>Huge waves surge in the darkness,</p>
<p>A storm rages across the sky.</p>
<p>Hey! Don't be afraid,</p>
<p>Don't panic.</p>
<p>Use steadfast eyes to gaze into the distance.</p>
<p>Shake off all your strength,</p>
<p>Strive forward! Break through the treacherous waves!</p>
<p>We are together on a lonely boat,</p>
<p>We live together, we die together.</p>
<p>One day, dispel the gloomy atmosphere,</p>
<p>And the clamorous universe returns to its original state.</p>
<p>Fear and panic drift away in the waves.</p>
<p>See white clouds lingering in the sky above the sea.</p>
<p>See the green seedlings planted on the shores of the happy other side.</p>
<p>A bright song rises on the lonely boat.</p>
<p>The hazy East,</p>
<p>Emerges with a dazzling dawn.</p>

<p>— Fang Qiong</p>
<p>It has been four years since I stepped into this city full of intoxicating romantic atmosphere. In these many days, I have lived a tightly packed schedule every day, dispatching thousands of unforgettable evenings.</p>
<p>Thousands of evenings, along with the social environment and life turbulence in recent years, began to lurch and somersault; I have spent many different joyful and beautiful evenings, but I can't count how many difficult and sorrowful nights I have endured; I only feel that the days are getting more and more tense, and sometimes I even feel that my whole life has fallen into the abyss of life, unable to touch the edge, unable to grasp the shore...</p>
<p>Since childhood, I have stubbornly wandered to foreign lands, and I have acquired a hard heart. This time, under the endless flames of war, I was blown to Shanghai (initially, of course, I came to escape). At that time, I said to myself:</p>
<p>"The mouth that is used to eating tree bark and grass roots is now preparing to learn to absorb dust and coal dust!"</p>
<p>But I have always been attached to the fact that Shanghai is a cultural source, so no matter how much difficulty the problem of living brings me, I refused the repeated tempting beckoning from my family. I stubbornly lived like a groundhog squatting in a hole, living alone.</p>
<p>So the days unfolded to the present,</p>
<p>I cherish and protect my every evening. During the day, from eight o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening, I fully solved my desire for knowledge and the problem of living, so all day long, I packed all my twelve hours, teaching, reading, and teaching again in the evening. Every night, whether it is a night with the northwest wind blowing tightly, or a night with heavy rain pouring down, wandering along the noisy city, I look for the quiet streets, stepping on my own footsteps that I can hear myself under the evening lights, dragging my tired body back home, and begin to spend my evening.</p>
<p>I leave all my private affairs, big and small, to be taken care of in the evening. The house is very desolate. I start to unpack and read the letters from my distant hometown; my elderly parents complain to me with resentment about the situation in their hometown, and also earnestly exhort their children; in this way, I once again remember my hometown in the misty fog, a long series of quiet scenes flashed through my mind, it seems that many kinds of clamorous and nagging voices attacked me; suddenly I saw my father stroking his wheat-awn-like beard, saying to me:</p>
<p>"Child, come back! The land is gold!"</p>
<p>Parents love their children, but they don't understand the hearts of their children, they don't understand why their children are willing to leave their inch of golden land, and wander and run outside all day long, but there is no complaint, no resentment, even if they are so poor that they are starving from morning till night.</p>
<p>"Since you are so poor, why don't you go home and stay for a while?"</p>
<p>But I silently shook my head.</p>
<p>"There are many people who go home to sit at this time, it's always better to be at home than alone outside."</p>
<p>I still smiled at those who cared about me.</p>
<p>In fact, I can only afford one lunch a day. In the long evenings, I have the "good fortune" to smell the aroma of rice wafting from the streets, the sweetness of the rice grains makes my nostrils open and the wrinkles on my face straighten out; my hungry stomach attacks me so fiercely, my intestines are squeezed tightly together, but I warn myself:</p>
<p>"How many people are suffering the same fate as me? Otherwise, the poverty of the soul will make you..."</p>
<p>So I hold my head high, smile, and boldly continue to spend my own beautiful evening.</p>
<p>I cherish and protect every inch of time in my evenings. I will not forget that part of the books on my desk are waiting for me. I joyfully finish reading the prescribed number of pages every day, and I feel as relaxed as if I have had a full dinner; I have completed a part of my difficult task of staying in Shanghai. I know myself that the meaning of our human existence is here, as long as the cells are still active, I demand that the will to work will never fade; only this kind of life allows me to fearlessly strive to develop.</p>
<p>"Roosters look for high perches, large ships look for wide seas, and women look for a peaceful life where they can enjoy themselves."</p>
<p>Friends before and after me point and talk about me, they scold me, I won't find a few rich boyfriends, can spend sweet evenings in the brightly lit dance halls; even they pityingly teach me how to be charming in the evening and deal with men; but I tell them, I am not afraid of material difficulties.</p>
<p>I know that in these evenings, I have different gains from them. I am planning to store five years of food—this is originally the fruit of every evening that I have tasted hardship!</p>
<p>After reading the prescribed books, I stand up, take a breath, and hurriedly circle the room twice. The room is so small that these two circles seem like a key turning twice in a lock; I sit down at the table again and start to review my work of the day.</p>
<p>During the day, the sun burns me, like a potter burning pottery, giving me color, sound, and hardness; in the evening, this is a string of dark shadows, quietly, I peel off my own skin again and again, through the depths of my soul, I examine some of the corrosive longings that remain, these corrosive lamentations, if they grow in my heart, will bring me depression and sorrow, chilling my heart, what I need is the tenacity of white, discarding all dross, so after peeling off my skin again and again, each time I grow a new layer of skin.</p>
<p>I judge many thoughts, these thoughts are many and long, like the roads in the grassland, so my evening is easily dispatched.</p>
<p>Every evening, I warn myself.</p>
<p>"The passage of time is so rapid, when you have not grasped this evening and prepared to do something, the evening has passed again."</p>
