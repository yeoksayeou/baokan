<h3 id="c1">義大利之變與時局動向 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>消息傳來，義大利巴特里奥內閣終於向反軸心　締結城下之盟了。就目前大局而論，義大利政府之對英美妥協，對於歐洲戰爭與世界形勢，會發生什麽影響呢？這是必須加以冷靜和客觀的硏究的。</p>
<p>自從軸心軍從北非突尼斯撤退，反　心　向西西里島登陸以來，歐洲戰局即開始比較重大的轉變，主要的特徵是表現在蘇聯在東綫改取攻勢和義大利本國陷於戰時狀態，當時德義兩元首在義大利北部之會議，想必早已預見到歐局可能的動向，因而不久黑索里尼即以辭職間。德國在此時期，爲了對付最主要和頑强的敵人，其軍事的重心，當然是放在柬綫的。對於南歐的局面，主要是着重在政治和外交攻勢，爭取時間，以完成南歐的防務。因此，在西西里幾乎完全以較少的兵力，使反軸心軍受到最大的消耗，而以較大的實力迅速從分散的各綫撤退，以固南疆。從最近數月來的局勢看，德國這種戰略，是在順利地完成中</p>
<p>從戰略形勢勢說，歐洲戰爭的重心，自三十年六月以來，一直停滯在東綫，三十一年秋，英美非法在北非登陸，以至西西里島作戰，雖然一般人的目光逐漸移向地中海兩岸，然而德國的注意力始終集中在東綫，反軸心軍儘管如何盡力宣傳「第二　錢」，但是，始終未能從東錢調走德國一兵一卒。現在義大利雖然不幸顚蹶了，但實際上反軸心國依舊沒有達到「第二戰綫」的夢想，德國用不到從東綫調遣軍隊到其他戰錢。而且，反可减輕德國對義大利的軍事負担，集中本來分散的兵力，依阿爾卑斯山脈天然的險要，佈成反英美的鋼城，惟恐今後敵人不敢引重兵越峻嶺來叩關！所以，我們不必杞憂歐洲今後的戰局。</p>
<p>從政治形勢來看，我們固然絕對不能忽視美英利用時機，向西班牙·瑞士·瑞典和土耳其等中立國家肆行誘脅，甚至還會向巴爾幹半島及其他國家伸展其政治活動；然而，在迢裹同時不能忽視，由於義大利問題的解決，美英二國和蘇聯勢力已有直接發生衝突的危機，今後反軸心國家內部關係之愈趨複雜化，英美蘇聯與中立國家間關係之微妙的發展，都有引起反軸心國內部紛爭的可能。邱吉爾羅斯福至今還在華盛頓，還在不斷地進行折衝，可見憂慮未來局勢的，不是德國，而是英美。所以說，義國今日之不幸顛蹶，對於歐洲旣成局勢，是不會有什麼不良影響的</p>
<p>新的事變，自然不能不注意到敵人第二步的動向。羅邱的談判迄未結束，英美蘇使節會談的結果尙未公布，三國首腦會議的時機也許更趨成熟，然而結果顯然是不易捉摸的。就蘇聯的立塲說，迄未承認過義大利是第二戰綫，因爲義大利問題並沒有從蘇聯戰綫上吸收去德國的兵力，相反的，自夏季以來，蘇聯因採取反攻，在兵力上，軍火上，資源上，已經冒了極大的損失，他們對於「眞正的第二戰綫」感到更迫急的需要了。可是，美英帝國主義者始終抱着使德蘇互相消耗的陰謀。在新的形勢之下，他們必須重新估計德蘇勢力之對比，他們如果調移兵力「開闢西綫」，在法比荷丹各地登陸，當然這是意想以外的冒險運動，那時美英木國必須竭力搜刮本國所有，以補充供應大陸作戰需要，不免有焦頭爛額之苦，而在東方則顯然將使蘇聯有喘息補養的機會，布爾塞維克的勢力逐漸侵凌巴爾幹，以至非洲，近東中東各地，將來縱思反攻，亦不免有爲時已晚之悔。所以美英當局今後決不能允應蘇方要求，而僅能向巴爾幹活動，那麼，歐洲的戰爭就不免有向美英蘇衝突發展的趨勢了。</p>
<p>歐洲的動態，不能說和東亞形勢完全無關，由於地中海形勢之轉變，由於英美有一部份賸餘的兵力可以騰挪，國際間已經傳出了印度洋局勢趨緊的謠言，而蒙特巴頓之被任爲東南亞洲反軸心軍總司令一事，也引起了一般人的注意。我們在此嚴重的決戰階段，絕不許對敵作過低的估計，然而，檢討一般大局，友邦在大東亞範圍內無論軍事上政治上都站在絕對優越與主動的地位，去年八月以來開始的美軍太平洋反攻，除了自蒙慘重損失以外，迄未使東亞形勢有絲毫改變。而東亞軸心之日趨鞏固，十一億亞洲民族的團結奮鬥，更保障太平洋上之永遠安全。</p>
<p>最後，我們不能不以義大利之顚　而盼望我國人與東亞諸戰友共表警惕。義大利之屈服，原因雖多，但本身戰爭資源之缺乏，作戰機構與黨，政，軍，民間親密聯系之不足，一般人民與法西斯黨間情感的隔絕，阻碍了總力戰體制之完成。我們必須時時以恐懼戒愼之心，自勉勉人，團結一致，始能確保大東亞戰爭的光榮勝利，進而完遂戰爭的最後目標。</p>

<h3 id="c2">義大利局部停戰　日德發重要聲明　必勝信念决不致稍受影響 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日政府九日十四時三十分發表聲明如次：義大利巴特里奧政府已無條件對英美降服，此乃違反日德義三國同盟及單獨不購和之約者，帝國實引爲遺憾。然帝國政府已預料此事態，而講求萬全措置，此次事件對戰爭大局無影響，帝國之必勝信念愈形堅固，幷有德國等歐洲盟邦各國及大東亞各國家各民族緊密提携協力，俾能澈底擊滅英美。我一億國民須愈益昻揚三千年來之傳統奮鬥精神與强毅之意志，一億一心，毅然發揮最大戰力，完成聖戰基石以安聖慮。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日政府方面對於義國無條件降服所抱見解大致如次：日本遂行大東亞戰爭之政策，決不因義國無條件降服而受任何影響，縱使將發生如何事態，又戰爭將進展至如何長期，日本完遂戰爭之決心及必勝之信念亦不爲之微動。日本途行大東亞戰爭之目的，前曾屢次向國內外聞明，乃在解放亞洲被壓迫民族與達成樹立大東亞共榮圈，爲此決排除一切困難與障礙向前邁進。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據官方本日所發表之聲明，指出德軍高級指軍部對於義大利現政府之公開叛變，早巳有所準備，因此已採取必要之軍事措施，以應付時局。自七月二十五日前義相墨索里尼遭受攻擊及與英美同謀推翻法西斯政府後，德軍高級指揮即已準備有此一着，此項對歐洲保衛者之不忠襲擊，結果必歸失敗。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據德外交部消息靈通方面稱：德國政府對於義王及義相巴特里奧所採之步驟，並不感覺驚異，德國已採取必要之預防措施，以保護其本國及共盟邦並將繼續作戰至獲最後勝利。</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　義巴特里奧內閣無條件降服英美消息到達後，我國府　局表示見解如次：一巴特里奧內閣投降英美，早在吾人意料之中，緣本年七月義內閣變更時，吾人早已知其受英美所策動。</p>
<p>國府當局表明見解</p>
<p>日德兩國對於巴特里奥內閣背叛軸心，早已有充分之準備，且巴特里奥內閣投降英美，原屬一部分無聊政客之所爲，未足以代表義大利全體國民意志，對軸心作戰前途，不但亳無影響，反使軸心國作戰力量益加堅强，作戰力量益加集中，戰局前途益見有利。惟巴特里奥內閣所爲，實背叛三國同盟條約及不單獨媾和條約，於義大利民族史上留下一莫大汚點。國民政府參加大東亞戰爭以來，早具與友邦日本同生共死駢肩作戰決心，自本整定方針加緊邁進，貫敵參戰目的，完遂大東亞戰爭之偉大使命。</p>
<p>巴特里奧廣播內容</p>
<p>羅馬九日中央社電　蒂芬尼社八日夜　道如次：義首相巴特里奧八日下午七時四十分廣播稱，義政府已承認不能再對優勢之敵勞力繼續不均衡之抗爭，爲避免今後國民遭受更重大之不幸，已對英美兩國聯軍司令艾森霍華將軍提議休戰，反軸心軍方面已接受此提議，故無論何處之義軍亦須停止對英美之敵對行動，然義軍對於其他方面之攻擊將予以反抗。</p>
<p>停戰協定業已簽字</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據倫敦公布：英美　軍司令艾森霍華將軍宣佈義大利之投降，並稱彼已予以軍事之和平，該項投降巳爲英美蘇三國之批准。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　路透社於星期三晚自北非艾森霍華將軍總部宣告：義大利政府已無條件降服，艾森霍華將軍已予接受，准予對義停戰。停戰協定係由艾森霍華將軍之代表及巴特里奧元帥之代表簽訂，立即生效。同時巴特里奥元帥於九月八日尙與義王拒絕屈辱，現已在羅馬無綫電宜告證實義大利之投降，並承認已要求艾森霍華將軍停戰。停戰協定係由軍事當局簽訂之純粹軍事文件，並不包括政治財政經濟條件，停戰協定實際係於九月三日業已簽訂。</p>
<h3 id="c3">法西斯新政府　在北義成立　墨索里尼任首揆 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　此間今日宣佈：義大利法西斯國民政府，已在北義成立，由墨索里尼任首揆。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　義大利　四斯國民政府九日發表聲明，痛詆巴特里奥政權，幷表明處置此等國家叛徒之決意，最後要求義國艦船盡可能停泊於歐洲大陸各港灣待命，倘有駛往北非者，則我等必對之加以轟炸。</p>
<h3 id="c4">發表聲明 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據契亞索電：義大法西斯歐民政府利九日發表聲明，大意如次：巴特里奥元帥主持之義政府無條件投降反軸心軍以後，不僅已喪失議大利大部之地位，並喪失前次大戰及法西斯黨革命所獲之一切成果。彼等　欲實施分割祖國之無恥計釗，既抛棄西四里及撒丁兩島於前，復喪失義大利南部於後，而今巴特里奥元帥更宣布義軍停止戰鬥行爲，並與反軸心軍約定對德軍採取戰鬥行爲，義　將士今將受外國軍官指揮，使我祖國國土化為戰塲，塗炭生靈，預料此種逆施行爲，絕雖獲得成功。義大利法西斯國民政府已於義國北部正式成立，由墨索里尼担任首揆，本政府对對負責使祖國敗北之責任者嚴懲不貸，幷將竭盡所能，使義大利國民於戰爭中恢復過云之榮春，以謀祖國之復興，願國民諸君切勿服從屈辱祖國之命令，拒絕對戰友作戰，凡能與德軍並肩作戰者應作戰到底，諸君或可返鄉待命，總之凡我純粹偉大之義大利國民，均應根據我人之意見，忍受一切痛苦，為祖國繼續奮鬥。</p>

<h3 id="c13">變更作戰方略 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>德軍固守歐洲要塞</p>
<p>世界大戰進入第五年之日，在歐洲現在有二種歷史性的發展，其一具戰略的，另一則帶有政治的性質。先來檢討第一點，自去年十一月英美軍登陸北非以來，德國的作戰方針的確有重要的韓變。那就是從攻勢轉取收勢，收縮補給錢及縮短戰綫，專事强化「歐洲要塞」。直到今日爲止。英美軍雖僅在防備鞏固的「歐洲要塞」的外廓陣地一角獲得了立脚點，但却把　心軍之戰略的退却大為誇張，恰如此爲反軸心軍的大勝利，而企圖對軸心陣錢及中立國獲得；經戰的效果、而在他們的蘇聯，却取史現實的看法，不肯定把英美軍在北非及西西里島所獲的戰果看做第一級的勝利。而主張英美應將其所誇示的「偉大的」戰力用於開關西歐方面的眞正的第二戰錢。蘇聯並用威脅的口氣稱如共英美　躇不決時，蘇聯將獨力遂行戰綫</p>
<p>反軸心陣綫黑影</p>
<p>至於第二　政治的新發展，英美對蘇的齟齬很淸楚地表現在世界戰局上。反軸心陳綫的將來，佈滿着黑影。在這裏，英美還是不惜犧牲作孤注一擲，　險在歐洲大陸登陸呢？還是寗使蘇聯從自己陣綫中脫退？二途之中任擇共一。奎貝克會談中，對蘇問題成爲主要議題之一，而最爲英美所感到難於解決。過去幾個月之間，德國變　其　略一事，證明德軍今年在東部戰綫並朱對蘇聯軍開始最大規模的夏季攻勢，關於這來部戰綫的夏季作戰，紐約泰晤士報軍事記者漢遜，鮑爾溫在該報稱：</p>
<p>「際此七月東部戰棧的夏季攻勢中，先取攻勢者，究爲德國抑爲蘇聯？尙是一個謎。「又說「　蘇聯方而報告，德軍在東部戰錢中央部集結兵力三十師、即以其全部兵力三分之一弱的兵力向蘇方守備綫加以最初的攻擊。」對此，德國著名軍事評論家第德瑪爾將軍五月三十日廣播稱：</p>
<p>「德軍並無重演一九一八年　登道夫攻勢作戰的意圖，德軍自己不取攻勢，讓敵人冒險先取攻勢。」</p>
<p>當時反軸心陣綫靦爲這是德軍想隱蔽其開始夏季攻勢之最後準備的一種宣傳策略。但正如第德瑪爾將軍所聲明，德軍並不發動各方所期待的最大規模的夏季攻勢，僅在東部戰綫中央區爲分散蘇聯軍的總攻擊而開始局部的攻擊。</p>
<p>德軍變更戰略</p>
<p>那麽今夏德軍何以不在東部戰綫開始最大規模的攻擊呢？其理由是因爲德軍爲强化歐洲要塞的防衛，有効地利用一九四三年將德軍兵力重行改組。英美人民對這德軍因變更戰略而產生的軍事活動之呆鈍，大抱樂觀，一部分人寬賭　戰　在今年末可以結束。然而軍政的首腦部關於將來戰爭的動向，則抱着不同的見解。八月十六日，美國戰時動員局長官詹姆士，巴恩士在羅斯福支持之下，警戒過度的樂觀論。他說：</p>
<p>「大戰鬥方才開始，一點也沒有即將結束的理由。何故，蓋反軸心軍到現在爲止僅與歐　戰綫中全部軸心軍的戰鬥部隊百分之七弱交戰，而逐漸獲得勝利，而蘇聯在今日則與德國戰鬥部隊的百分之四十八相對　，所以德軍在目前的戰鬥中不過使用了其戰鬥部隊的一半以下，而且義國即使脫離戰陣、德國的守勢，也將似以前攻勢一樣强固。美國雖說業已動員了其仝部兵力九十個師團，但德國所有的戰鬥部隊，則凌駕反軸心軍之上。在軍事物資的消耗上，德軍也尙保持着　有利的均衡。就被破壞的裝備比較起來，德國由於反軸心空軍轟炸而喪失的數量，不及反軸心方面由於德國潛水艦的通商破壞者而喪失的數量那樣多。」</p>
<p>又漢遜，鮑爾溫在七月十八日紐約泰晤士報上關於德國軍事力的現勢敘述如次：</p>
<p>「今日德軍擁有總兵力三百五十至三百六十　師團。其中約四十六個師團為守備軍，全師團之中二百個師團以上在東部戰綫，並有諸軸心國的軍隊二十至三十個師團爲助。空軍力方面，德國有第一綫飛機五千至六千架，其中大概二千架在東部戰綫，此數不及總數之半，在西歐及地中海的機數更較多東部戰綫。（翔：自九月三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>研究室巡禮</p>
<p>內科診療室裏，陳列着兩架在上海少見的醫療機器，一架是新陳代謝測騐機，一架是心臟電流測騐機，靠了這兩架機器，曾使成百成千的病人免受醫不對症的苦痛以及寃枉的損失。</p>
<p>四門婦孺醫院還有透熱電療機等新型治療工具，紫光燈等等器械儀器，在成部路門診部，還有X光室等　設備。爲着診斷的正確，治療妥善，和收效迅速，這幾年來，雖在極困難大之中，她們還是不惜重價，多方收羅。藥品方面，亦與機械儀器一樣，務擇其最優者。</p>
<p>一間小小的藥室，在製煉針用的葡萄糖，蒸溜水，以及共他輸血用品。從一般藥房購進的藥品，她們都要經過嚴密的檢査和化騐，認爲必要時，他一們都得實行加工。在人力與時間金錢上，當然多了一筆投失，但是對於病人，却是莫大的功德！　院長請一個意義沉長的故事，說請人如需要輸血，照例說明血型，由輸血所供應，那一次說明需要A型，但來供血的經過檢騐，證明不是A型，一加盤問，原來輪血所指定的那個人，在半路上拉黃包車去了，他們隨便拉一個熟人來供血！如果不加覆騐，不就會鬧出亂子來了嗎？</p>
<p>病理硏究室裏，保存着所有病人診治的紀錄，特別是兩壁架上，陳列許多　病標本，最多的是產科和花　科方面的，如三胞胎的胎盤，畸形的胎胞，在母腹內自己打了一個結的　帶，四肢知縮的巨　嬰兒，梅毒危險抑的膨大了的心臟，兒童的開了洞的病肺，　　的肓腸等等、據　有不少醫科學生和實習醫生，要到這裏來參觀硏究。對於病入或死亡者自雖提供角剖的，種們定有特別優越的酬　　法，過去且曾由院奉贈棺木，現在，當然無能爲力了。</p>
<p>救命女子的「家庭」</p>
<p>西門外婦孺醫院裏，團結着一批專心致力於救命工作的女子，形成一個「救命者的家庭」。最高權力機關是董事會，董事都是基督教的忠誠的信徒，如浸理會的鄭感組新（董事長），監理會的曹孫素馨：女公會的　元恩夫人等，但是也特約敎外熱心社會事業的太太小姐們參加爲　事。自前年十二月中句以後，一切行政統由華籍婦女組織執行委員曾處理。全院服務人員共一百三十餘人，計有醫師十七人，護士長二十二人，護士生四十三人職員十四人，工友三十八人，共中除外科醫師一名及少數職員工友以外，全部都是女性。</p>
<p>婦孺醫院院長　　　氏，一位熱心而能幹的其督敎徒早才民國十四年畢業於康乃爾大學醫科，囘國後即任該院內科醫師，十六年起至三十年，曾任上海女子醫學院內科教授，自去年起，担任該院院長及內科特約醫師，內科主治醫師是副院長黃惠干氏，婦科主治醫師是上中海女子醫學院畢業的李誦絃氏，兒科主治醫師也是上海女子醫學院畢業的黃淑瓊氏產科主治醫師，浙江省立醫藥專門學校畢業的黃德芳氏，病理室主任是鄧裕蘭氏，她曾於民國二十年赴美國加利福尼亞大學實習，担任美國菲城女子醫科大學病理助敎，廿二年囘國担任上海女　醫學院及聖約翰大學的病理敎授，那時就進該院任病理室主任了。外科方而有范示俊氏，於民國十五年畢業於女子醫學院後，即赴美國奔　非尼亞女子醫學院專習耳，鼻，喉科，歷任上海霖生，尙　，人機及該院專任醫師二科特約醫師　祖　氏，是該院唯一男性醫師，畢業於四北大學醫科歷任南京　　醫院外科醫師　。　　長張祖　，於民國十八年畢業於協和護十學校，即任該院護士長，　任上海協和護士學校敎師，自廿四年後即任該院總護士長及協和護十學校校長。</p>
<p>醫師和從業員們雖然都有輝煌的學歷和經歷，然而，都抱着犧牲服務的精神。因爲該院一向以救治貧病爲目的，所以在經濟方面，從無餘裕之日對於從業員的待遇很薄，　在最高薪金為五百元，伙食　平時二粥一飯，素菜數碗，上下一律。因此彼此互助互勸，努力於　務之改進，醫務之　密，從無黨派排　等現象，彼此相愛如一大　庭。</p>
<p>特點與問題</p>
<p>院長說，該院是一所慈善性的醫院，最大特點在對於貧富患者均一　同仁，難然爲病狀極重的免費病人，只要一息未絕，從不計較藥費多少，還是盡九醫治。貧病之急需手術者，有時雖分文未付，該院也急速爲之施行手術，不以繳費手續未淸而延誤治療。史可一談的是各科均有專任醫師及高初級駐院醫師，凡遇患者宜施行急救或手術而需多人施救的，往往全體合作。直到救治事竣，向不以非本科範圍　不問，就診者死亡率之低。絕非偶然。在今天，不愧爲最合理想的醫院。</p>
<p>談到經濟狀况，　院長訴述該院因爲三等病床佔全數四分之三，所以經當收入不敷開支，一向依靠國內外捐助，以資彌補。自前年十二月後，外夾捐助完全斷絕，偶有本市　士捐助若干，但貧病甚多，而開支日增，計本年一月至六月半年內，平均每月收入十二萬，支出方面僅伙食已達十一萬（每月米三十五　，麺紛六百斤，油一白七十二斤，柴一百二十担，煤夏天每月二噸冬天每月十五噸，菜每月一萬成千元）服務人員薪水及津巾二萬數千元，房租，房捐，水電，供埋器械印刷品等每月約三萬元，藥品每月三萬元，統　每月不足數萬元之　。而且許多藥品及　療器械，還須求諸黑市，普通手術所需手套，每打　在四千以上，（每次以四人計，每副只能用二，三次）所需縫合綫（羊腸錢）一每　不過五十吋，而十二管售價已在四，五千元。此外如則華，刀片，紗布棉花以及嬰兒尿布，　耗都很大，所以往往救治一個病人，會支出　千至數萬餘元，自己力量不足，就不敢經予接受，這是多麽令人不安的事！</p>
<p>本年正月赴，聲請上海市貧病救濟協會補助，由紀振綱先生前往調查，認爲適合標準，准予補査，計至八月底止，先後補手捐得一萬元，住院病人捐款總計約三萬元，申報小學敎員醫藥助金一萬元及由他　　借二，三萬元。有了這些收入，　幾月來，貧病者受救治者較多，而　院困難也稍減少。集中社會力量，發展社會事業，這是多麽令人興奮的事！續完）</p>

<p>其次，我們鑒於過去糧政的屢次失敗，端在「人謀不臧」，因此，人事問題，應爲新機構所最當注意的。我們前已屢次主張，新機構的中下後幹部人選，務須採用嚴格甄別，爲事擇人，絕不能徇情　，而有濫竿充數，不但功不能　，抑旦因此敗事。整個民食，實不能爲少數人兒戲的試騐。</p>

<p>商　　交易所，在　鼓　敲愈　的聲中，不久便要揭幕了。我們感覺戰時經濟問題的焦點，在於怎樣去靈活經濟事業；靈活經濟事業的重心，在於怎樣去繁榮工商經濟。工商經濟是整個戰時經濟的血脈，不可以不流通，與調和。同時，工商經濟猶如　林中的花草，欲其欣欣向榮，必須以增加流通各項生產證券爲其肥田資料，而其繁榮滋長的　地卽爲證券交易所。</p>
<p>本報社評前曾說過：恢復　券次易市塲之最大目的、爲使證劵交易，趨於正軌，以協助國民經濟之發展，與實　之繁榮。」何以言之？因爲華商股票是代表華商工商事業資產的一種證券，它的流動，就是工商事業資金的流動；進一步說，就是工商事業生產的增加。由於華商證券的流動，那末以前不能適合國家目的之社會資金運用，悉得爲適合於戰時經濟之　用了。</p>
<p>所以，華商證券交易所是我們工商經濟的園地其所可收　的，當然不祇是股要界的利益，而是　個生產界的利益，因爲，這個園地裏面所培植灌溉的，都是工商生產事業的資金；因此我們認爲在園藝方面，確須悉心研究、而園地的管理，尤不可不求其科學化。</p>

<p>— 廷</p>
<p>近年以來，因戰時物價的上漲，受其賜的，自然要算一般擁有資財而又能利用時機以圖暴利的人，最受威脅的，却要算一般工商業中的職工了。工商業中的職工。大多數都祗依賴固定的薪給過生活，物價無限制地照着幾何級數高跳上去，薪給或津貼，無論經過怎　調整，終究是跟不上的。</p>
<p>工商業職工的薪給收入，既不能與物價相均術，便不能不另求挹注之道而此種用作挹注的款項，其來源大抵不出於下列幾途：即　動用舊時的積　，　借貸，　從事於業外投機的收入，　賴所供職的企業中的年終花紅或年終獎勵金的收入，　舞弊</p>
<p>上述第一項與第二項來源雖屬正當，但前者因工商業職工中平時有儲　者不多，縱有也祇能　短時的抵補，不能作長時期的挹注，至於後者舉債以後債本付息的款項來源，根本便成問題，第三項來源，從事於業外的投機，姑撇開此舉對於社會的影響如何不論，工商業職工雖然對於市情比較熱習，可以從事於此，但自也有其各種限制，譬　：第一先要有一些資力，第二，要有比較空閒的時問，第三要人頭熟識，右進出貨物的能力，工商業職工中能符合這幾種條件的果然很多，但是更天多數的人都可以說與此無緣。至於第題項，靠年終的花紅和獎金來作挹注的。這可以說是一種最普通的方法。尤其是舊式商店中一的店員，平時的薪給既　低微，幾乎完全要依賴　一筆收入，這在過去幾年，因為物　無限制地高漲，雖然各業的實銷都不如從前，但因存貨的增値，幾乎莫不有鉅額的暴利。賺民錢自然要分潤一些給職工，這在職工們便多少略受其賜。至於以後呢？物價若能平定，暴利自然消滅，要想　這一筆收入抵補開支的不足，也是不可能。第五項來源違法更不要說　。（未完）</p>

<p>提案內容</p>
<p>此次北京市聯協會大都　係民食民生，　在分錄其提案內容及解決辦法於後。</p>
<p>（第一案）爲確立戰時經濟體制，請澈底推行低物價政策，勵　食糧統制，以安民生案，其中有涉及全華北之經濟統制，審議結果分為二部辦理。第一部有　統制全部及實行直接稅辦理、上呈全華北新民會聯合協議會辦理，第二部關於價格統制消費統制及企　統制等。由社會局接受現地解決。</p>
<p>（第二案）爲動行增產救民運動，請提高　　品評水準，廣拓耕　救濟貧民，以恤民　案。本市由社會局市總會慈善聯合會，全部接受，故即告解決。茲錄本案辦法如次：　主管機關內應專設獎勵農產機構，以資　成。　對於農產品評價之標準，應予提高，獎品亦應增加。　民政會雙方指導民衆，白動開拓種植，其成績昭著者，予以褒獎。　由政府撥給　地，積極開鑒，實行以工代　。　　資開設工廠，並擴充平民收容所，　乞丐之中年靑力壯者，挑遲爲勞工，其辦法由市公署市總會會同華北勞工協會擬定之。</p>

<p>（第四案）爲增　公務員福利，倡導消費合作事業，請殷立華北公務員消費合作社，並漸次推廣及於一般國民案。經　議結果，　　全聯</p>
<p>（第五案）爲吸收游資振興實業，應倡導國民儲金，創設必需品工廠，以倡節儉，而利民生案，審議結果移任委員會辦理。</p>
<p>（第六案）為請求社　兩局，嚴禁　店？間　　，以免市民露宿街　，有傷觀　，以維風化而正治安，免滋流弊案，本案辦法之一二兩賓巳由警　局接受，第三項辦法決定仍貫澈過去配給辦法惟須分期售　，以利貧民，至　給票印製費加入售　內計算。</p>
<p>（第七案）爲勵行淸政以固國本案，　議結果，認為在原則上一致贊同，惟辦法兩項應予修正如後：　准許人民檢舉，並由政府切實加以保障，但不得挾　誣告，　請求政府頒布貪官汚吏，及一般公務員，犯　緊急治罪暫行條例，重者處死刑，幷沒收其財產，此案上呈全聯</p>
<p>（第八案）禁絕烟毒一事，已爲關係國家存亡，故於去歲全聯席問，曾有極熱烈之爭辯。而最高當局亦有最入之禁毒決心。但時至今日，土膏店仍鱗次　比，未免矛盾，故大會李壯飛代表再行提出徹底禁毒以保健國民體位案，並由代表程希賢，　濬用等慷慨陳詞，主張封閉土脊店，但以此案非爲一市之問題，故　議長裁決提交全聯</p>
<p>（第九案）爲調査煤斤儲量以免發生煤　而防患未然案，由　代表說明理由，謂煤商往往藉。生活高漲一而違犯官價，設按生活情形而制定官價，則無口可藉，違者即行處罰，並提出辦法。　調查　量，　　紙公佈，　令出法隨，　確保斤兩之充足　元煤限制大　屬土，該案關乎市民生活極巨，決移任委員會辦理。</p>
<p>（第十案）用大會名義，函請交通當局對於旅客　帶食糧之量數予以增加，負　予以減少以利民食案，並提出辯法獲得當塲之鼓掌，當經議決移任委員會辦理，提早向關係機關。理由：查京市食糧，來源之困難，日甚一日，當局雖盡量籌劃，終難來源　旺，混合　之配給量，巳日漸减少，刻下每人每日只能購買半斤，但尙有時不能如數買到，似此情形與本市二百萬人之生命確有極大關係。且與治安，亦有莫大關係，今日所熱烈辯論者，所費時間最大者邊不外民食問題，而各代表所要求者又不外　當局如何圓滑配給。本市食糧如何使其來源增加，兩大原　，但此兩大問題，始終未蒙圓滿解答，本席有鑒及此，與其長時間的　求解答，莫若仍求諸大會本身，用大會名義　交通當局呼　，請求旅客携帶食糧問題，予以種種便利，俾增加本市食糧之來源，以補助官方開源辦法之不足。辦法：　增加旅客携帶食糧之數量，　減輕携帶食糧之負擔，　嚴禁路警之剝削。（益泉寄九月二日）</p>

<h3 id="c43">兒童精神食糧的寶庫　兒童圖書館訪問記 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>兒童教育的重要，超過於成人敎育，成人敎育的成敗，實其於兒童教育的良　上，國人對於兒童敎育，素來缺乏重視，兒童們沒有正當的精神食糧來解決飢渴，於是就造成了街頭爭看連環圖盡的怪現象，使純潔的腦子裏，充滿了「牛鬼蛇神」的腐敗印象。</p>
<p>上海兒童圖書館，便是因着這種需要而產生的。創立於民國二十九年的兒童節，由中華慈幼協會·上海街童敎育會，兒童保育會，工部局兒童保障科等十一個團體暨社會　心人士所共同發起，於三十年七月十四日正式成立於靜安寺路的大華商塲，其宗旨在灌輸兒童以良好的知識敎育，供給兒童以令理的精神食糧，是一個輔助兒童敎育培養善良好國民的中國唯一的兒音圖書館。藏書兩百多萬册，綜計過去二年中免費閱覽的不下十五萬人。</p>
<p>該件閱覽辦法，除掉免費供給來館兒童閱讀外，爲求普遍與便利起見，又訂定了個人與團體借出閱　的規則，也完全是務性的，每次僅收極少數的閱　　費和仍予發還的保證金，據該館統計，每月出借　籍册數，在五萬四千册左右，最近向該館申　借閱的學校團體，尙在急劇增加中。（現有　多處）</p>
<p>此外更在市內設立許多圖書流通站和巡迥圖書車，圖書流通站的目的，是在便利遠方兒童的借閱，像一個　書館的小分館，借閱手續和該館辦法相同，巡迥圖書車四輛每日至各處輪流巡迥，使一般街頭流浪的窮苦兒童，也能得着一　閱覽的機會，巡迥車每到一處，總有許多可憐的孩子圍着那巡迥車不放，可見他們感覺精神食糧的迫切，也可知道這種工作是有加以擴大和普遍的必要了。</p>
<p>最近該館因館務發展，原有館址不敷應用，擬購置林邨房屋作新館址，但代價須二十五萬元，這數目要由該館來負担，事實上是不可能的，於是由該館董事方子俊氏將其令郞方聞君書盡捐助該館，在　波同鄉會四樓陳列展覽，作爲義賣唱把全部收人，充作購置館屋經費。</p>
<p>要由一個小小的書家以其義費所得，來担負這筆數目不小的經費，事實上還相差很遠，但以一個年僅十三的孩童能盡了這樣一個責任，已是雖能可貴，因此希望全市有心於兒童敎育事業的熱心人士，多多協助，俾能以共同的力量，來促其完成一。（修儒）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Changes in Italy and Trends in the Current Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>News has arrived that the Italian Badoglio Cabinet has finally surrendered unconditionally to the Allies. As far as the current overall situation is concerned, what impact will the Italian government's compromise with Britain and the United States have on the European war and the world situation? This is something that must be studied calmly and objectively.</p>
<p>Since the Axis forces retreated from Tunisia in North Africa and the Allies landed in Sicily, the European war situation has begun to undergo relatively significant changes. The main features are reflected in the Soviet Union's shift to an offensive on the Eastern Front and Italy's own entry into a state of war. The meeting between the German and Italian heads of state in northern Italy at that time must have foreseen the possible trends in the European situation, and therefore Mussolini soon resigned. During this period, in order to deal with the most important and stubborn enemy, Germany's military focus was naturally placed on the Eastern Front. For the situation in Southern Europe, the main emphasis was on political and diplomatic offensives, buying time to complete the defense of Southern Europe. Therefore, in Sicily, it used relatively few troops to inflict the greatest consumption on the Allies, and quickly withdrew from the scattered lines with greater strength to consolidate the southern border. Judging from the situation in recent months, Germany's strategy is being successfully completed.</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view, the focus of the European war has been stagnant on the Eastern Front since June of the 30th year. In the autumn of the 31st year, Britain and the United States illegally landed in North Africa and fought in Sicily. Although the eyes of the general public gradually shifted to the Mediterranean coast, Germany's attention has always been focused on the Eastern Front. No matter how hard the Allies tried to promote the "Second Front," they still failed to draw a single German soldier from the Eastern Front. Now, although Italy has unfortunately fallen, in reality, the Allies have still not achieved their dream of a "Second Front." Germany does not need to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to other fronts. Moreover, it can reduce Germany's military burden on Italy, concentrate its originally dispersed forces, and build a steel city against Britain and the United States based on the natural dangers of the Alps, fearing that the enemy will not dare to lead heavy troops across the mountains to knock on the gate! Therefore, we do not need to worry about the future war situation in Europe.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, we certainly cannot ignore the fact that the United States and Britain are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out threats and inducements to neutral countries such as Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Turkey, and may even extend their political activities to the Balkan Peninsula and other countries. However, at the same time, we cannot ignore that due to the resolution of the Italian issue, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are facing the crisis of direct conflict. The increasingly complex internal relations of the Allied countries and the subtle development of relations between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and neutral countries may cause internal disputes within the Allies. Churchill and Roosevelt are still in Washington, constantly negotiating, which shows that it is not Germany that is worried about the future situation, but Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is said that Italy's unfortunate fall today will not have any adverse impact on the existing situation in Europe.</p>
<p>New events naturally require attention to the enemy's second move. The negotiations between Roosevelt and Churchill have not yet ended, the results of the meeting between the British, American, and Soviet envoys have not been announced, and the timing of the summit of the three countries may be more mature, but the results are obviously elusive. From the Soviet Union's point of view, it has never recognized Italy as the Second Front, because the Italian issue has not absorbed German troops from the Soviet front. On the contrary, since the summer, the Soviet Union has taken the offensive, and has suffered great losses in terms of troops, ammunition, and resources. They feel a more urgent need for a "real Second Front." However, the American and British imperialists have always harbored the conspiracy of making Germany and the Soviet Union consume each other. Under the new situation, they must re-evaluate the balance of power between Germany and the Soviet Union. If they transfer troops to "open the Western Front" and land in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark, this is of course an unexpected adventurous movement. At that time, the United States and Britain must do their best to search for everything in their own countries to supplement the needs of continental operations, and they will inevitably suffer from being in a hurry. In the East, it will obviously give the Soviet Union a chance to breathe and recuperate, and the power of the Bolsheviks will gradually encroach on the Balkans, and even Africa, the Near East, and the Middle East. In the future, even if they think of a counterattack, it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, the American and British authorities will never be able to comply with the Soviet demands in the future, but only to carry out activities in the Balkans. In that case, the European war will inevitably develop into a conflict between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The dynamics in Europe cannot be said to be completely unrelated to the situation in East Asia. Due to the changes in the Mediterranean situation and the availability of some surplus forces for Britain and the United States to maneuver, rumors of tightening tensions in the Indian Ocean have spread internationally, and the appointment of Mountbatten as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia has also aroused public attention. At this critical stage of the decisive battle, we must never underestimate the enemy. However, reviewing the general situation, friendly countries are standing in an absolutely superior and active position in the Greater East Asia region in terms of both military and political affairs. Since the US military's counteroffensive in the Pacific, which began in August of last year, has not made the slightest change in the East Asian situation, except for suffering heavy losses. The increasingly solid East Asian Axis and the united struggle of the 1.1 billion Asian people guarantee the permanent security of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Finally, we cannot help but hope that our people and our East Asian comrades will be vigilant in view of Italy's downfall. There are many reasons for Italy's submission, but the lack of its own war resources, the insufficient close connection between the combat institutions and the party, government, military, and civilians, and the emotional isolation between the general public and the Fascist Party have hindered the completion of the total war system. We must always be vigilant and self-improving, unite as one, and then we can ensure the glorious victory of the Greater East Asia War and complete the final goal of the war.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Italy's Partial Armistice: Important Statements by Japan and Germany: The Belief in Victory Will Not Be Affected in the Slightest <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government issued a statement at 14:30 on the 9th as follows: The Italian Badoglio government has unconditionally surrendered to Britain and the United States, which violates the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the agreement not to conclude peace separately. The Empire regrets this. However, the Imperial Government had anticipated this situation and sought comprehensive measures. This incident has no impact on the overall war situation, and the Empire's belief in victory is becoming increasingly firm. It is also working closely with European allies such as Germany and countries and nations in Greater East Asia to thoroughly destroy Britain and the United States. Our 100 million citizens must further promote the traditional fighting spirit and strong will of the past 3,000 years, and with one heart and one mind, resolutely exert the greatest combat power to complete the cornerstone of the holy war to reassure the Emperor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's views on Italy's unconditional surrender are roughly as follows: Japan's policy of carrying out the Greater East Asia War will not be affected in any way by Italy's unconditional surrender. No matter what happens, and no matter how long the war progresses, Japan's determination to complete the war and its belief in victory will not waver. Japan's purpose in carrying out the Greater East Asia War has been repeatedly explained to the domestic and foreign public, which is to liberate the oppressed nations of Asia and achieve the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. To this end, we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and move forward.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the official statement issued today, the German High Command was prepared for the Italian government's open rebellion, and has therefore taken the necessary military measures to deal with the situation. Since the attack on former Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on July 25 and the conspiracy with Britain and the United States to overthrow the Fascist government, the German High Command has been prepared for this move. This disloyal attack on the protectors of Europe will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to sources familiar with the German Foreign Ministry, the German government does not feel surprised by the steps taken by the Italian King and Prime Minister Badoglio. Germany has taken the necessary precautionary measures to protect its own country and its allies, and will continue to fight until final victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - After the news of the unconditional surrender of the Italian Badoglio Cabinet to Britain and the United States arrived, the National Government authorities expressed their views as follows: The Badoglio Cabinet's surrender to Britain and the United States was expected by us, because when the Italian Cabinet changed in July of this year, we already knew that it was instigated by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>National Government Authorities Express Their Views</p>
<p>Japan and Germany were fully prepared for the Badoglio Cabinet's betrayal of the Axis, and the Badoglio Cabinet's surrender to Britain and the United States was originally the work of a few boring politicians, which is not enough to represent the will of the entire Italian people. It not only has no impact on the future of the Axis war, but also makes the Axis countries' combat power stronger and more concentrated, and the future of the war is more favorable. However, what the Badoglio Cabinet has done is a betrayal of the Tripartite Pact and the agreement not to conclude peace separately, leaving a huge stain on the history of the Italian nation. Since the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, it has long been determined to live and die with its ally Japan and fight side by side. From this starting point, it will intensify its efforts to advance, fulfill the purpose of participating in the war, and complete the great mission of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Badoglio's Broadcast Content</p>
<p>Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's reported on the evening of the 8th as follows: Italian Prime Minister Badoglio broadcast at 7:40 pm on the 8th, stating that the Italian government has recognized that it can no longer continue the unbalanced resistance against the superior enemy. In order to avoid greater misfortune for the people in the future, it has proposed an armistice to General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States. The Allied side has accepted this proposal, so the Italian army in any place must also stop hostile actions against Britain and the United States, but the Italian army will resist attacks from other directions.</p>
<p>The Armistice Agreement Has Been Signed</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to London's announcement: General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States, announced the surrender of Italy, and said that he has granted it military peace. The surrender has been approved by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reported from General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa on Wednesday evening: The Italian government has surrendered unconditionally, and General Eisenhower has accepted it, granting Italy an armistice. The armistice agreement was signed by representatives of General Eisenhower and representatives of Marshal Badoglio, and took effect immediately. At the same time, Marshal Badoglio was still refusing to be humiliated with the Italian King on September 8. It has now been confirmed by Radio Rome that Italy has surrendered and admitted that it has requested an armistice from General Eisenhower. The armistice agreement is a purely military document signed by military authorities and does not include political, financial, or economic conditions. The armistice agreement was actually signed on September 3.</p>
<h3 id="e3">A New Fascist Government Established in Northern Italy: Mussolini Appointed Prime Minister <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - It was announced here today that the Italian Fascist National Government has been established in northern Italy, with Mussolini as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Fascist National Government issued a statement on the 9th, denouncing the Badoglio regime and stating its determination to deal with these national traitors. Finally, it demanded that Italian ships be moored in various ports on the European continent as much as possible to await orders. If they sail to North Africa, we will bomb them.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Statement Issued <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chiasso: The Italian Fascist National Government issued a statement on the 9th, which mainly stated: After the Italian government headed by Marshal Badoglio unconditionally surrendered to the Allies, it not only lost most of the territory of Italy, but also lost all the results achieved in the previous war and the Fascist Party revolution. They attempted to implement a shameless plan to divide the motherland, abandoning Sicily and Sardinia in the front, and losing southern Italy in the back. Now Marshal Badoglio has announced that the Italian army will cease fighting and has agreed with the Allies to take combat actions against the German army. Italian soldiers will now be commanded by foreign officers, turning the territory of our motherland into a battlefield, and causing the people to suffer. It is expected that this kind of perverse behavior will never succeed. The Italian Fascist National Government has been officially established in northern Italy, with Mussolini as Prime Minister. This government will severely punish those responsible for the defeat of the motherland, and will do everything possible to restore the past glory of the Italian people in the war, in order to seek the revival of the motherland. May the people of the country never obey orders that humiliate the motherland, refuse to fight against their comrades, and those who can fight side by side with the German army should fight to the end. You may return to your hometown to await orders. In short, all my pure and great Italian people should, according to our opinion, endure all suffering and continue to fight for the motherland.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 9th: After the Italian government surrendered, the German troops stationed in Italy immediately took appropriate measures in accordance with the pre-determined plan. All Italian troops who did not obey the orders of the German commanders were disarmed, and important transportation hubs in Italy were successfully taken over by the German army. After being disarmed, the Italian troops stationed in Greece withdrew to the coastal areas to await orders from the German headquarters. The military strongholds in northern and central Italy have been occupied by the German army, and the areas in the above-mentioned areas that have not been occupied by the German army are now occupied by the German army.

<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - All the Allied wireless stations broadcasted the call of Admiral Cunningham, Commander of the British Navy in the Mediterranean, today, demanding that all Italian ships sail into Allied ports. If it is necessary due to lack of fuel, they should sail into neutral ports. If there is a risk of being captured, they can sink themselves. Cunningham's announcement stated that Italian ships in the Mediterranean can immediately sail to Gibraltar, Tripoli, Malta, Haifa, and Alexandria to surrender, and Italian ships in the Black Sea can sail into Soviet ports. At the same time, the BBC stated that Italy has seven battleships, three aircraft carriers under construction, two damaged heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, twenty-five destroyers, and sixty submarines.

The Italian Air Force has already been taken over by the German Air Force and incorporated into the Third Division of the German Air Force. These planes will rarely fall into the hands of the Allies. In any case, most of the planes must have been withdrawn by the German army.</p>

<h3 id="e11">National Political Work Conference Opened in Nanjing Yesterday: Subdivided into Three Groups to Review Various Proposals <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The National Political Work Conference of the Military Commission opened in Nanjing today (the 9th). At 7:00 am, all attendees gathered at the Military Commission, led by Xiang Zhizhuang, the Director of the General Affairs Department, to pay their respects at the mausoleum. At 10:00 am, the opening ceremony was held in the National Government Auditorium. The attendees included Chief of General Staff Bao, Director General of Army Training Huang, and Director of the Aviation Department Yao. There were more than a dozen guests and fifty-two participants in the meeting. After the ceremony, Chairman Xiang listened to the report and reported on the reasons and significance of convening this National Political Work Conference. It briefly stated: Since the reorganization of the National Government's military institutions in September of this year, political training work has been divided into three departments: the army, navy, and air force. The advantage is that each agency has thorough management and investigation of political training work, and promotion is convenient. But on the other hand, it is felt that the promotion of political training work lacks unity and cannot be carried out in conjunction with military training. Therefore, in June of this year, the Military Commission established a Political Training Department under the General Affairs Department to manage the political training affairs of the national military institutions. In order to restore the central political training institution and to connect with the political training departments of various troops, agencies, and schools, this political work conference was convened. Since the National Government joined the war on January 9, in order to make the soldiers understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and to increase the enthusiasm for participating in the war, political training work has been particularly important. This is another reason for convening the political work conference. In this conference, I deeply hope that everyone will thoroughly review the past, and pool your wisdom to decide the future strategy of political training work. After the meeting is over, everyone will return to their posts, and I hope that everyone will work together to promote the decision of the meeting. Chief of Staff Bao gave a sincere speech, which moved the listeners. The opening ceremony was completed at 10:30 am.</p>
<p>First Meeting</p>
<p>After the National Political Work Conference opened in the National Government Auditorium, the first meeting was held in the Legislative Yuan's conference hall, chaired by Director Xiang. First, Secretary-General Zhou reported that there were forty-six participating units, fifty-two attendees, and five observers. Ninety proposals and ten work reports were received. The agenda for discussion and the list of personnel for group review were passed, and they were divided into three groups. Regarding organizational matters, Gao Yaowu and Li Binru were the conveners. Regarding propaganda and training matters, Jiang Dafu and Sun Youde were the conveners. Regarding funding matters, Kui Hongkui and Ma Kepu were the conveners. Then, a congratulatory telegram was passed to the chairman. The first meeting was adjourned at 11:00 am.</p>
<p>Reviewing Proposals</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The National Political Work Conference continued to hold group review meetings at the Legislative Yuan's conference hall at 3:00 pm on the 9th. Each group reviewed very carefully and thoroughly. Each case has been added by each group according to the review opinions, so that it can be submitted to the general assembly for resolution. The review meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm, and the second meeting will be held tomorrow (the 10th) at 9:00 am.</p>
<p>P&gt;Governor Su, Li Shiqun, Passes Away</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - National Government Order (September 9): Li Shiqun, Governor of Jiangsu Province, was intelligent, decisive, and had a profound understanding. Since participating in the peace, anti-communist, and nation-building movement, he has eliminated rebels and made outstanding contributions. The clean-up campaign has been carried out diligently, and there have been many praises. He was expected to fully display his great plans and achieve his great career, but suddenly heard of his death from illness. I am deeply shocked. He will be granted 50,000 yuan in national currency for his funeral, and his life deeds will be announced to the national history to add color to his achievements. This is the order. Chairman of the National Government, Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Li Shiqun, Governor of Jiangsu, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea on the 7th and died on the 9th.</p>
<p>Li Shiqun, Governor of Jiangsu Province, who died on the 9th, was 38 years old and a native of Zhejiang Province. He graduated from Moscow Sun Yat-sen University and participated in the peace movement early. After returning to the capital, he first served as the Deputy Minister of the Police Administration Department, and then promoted to the Minister of the Police Administration Department. After the Police Administration Department was abolished, he was transferred to the position of Political Affairs Commissioner, Military Committee Member, and Minister of the Investigation and Statistics Department. When the clean-up campaign began, he served as the Secretary-General of the Clean-up Committee, and was later appointed as the Governor of Jiangsu Province and concurrently served as the Commander of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Forces. He suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhea on September 7 and died in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 9th after ineffective treatment. He is survived by his wife and children.</p>

<p>Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the government authorized the Central Reserve Bank to issue national currency, its credibility has increased day by day, and the demand for it has grown daily. Not only have old currencies disappeared in the peaceful areas, but other enemy currencies have also become useless. However, some who fail to understand the wartime policy have discovered cases of counterfeiting and using counterfeit currency. The 26th Supreme National Defense Council passed the Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime. This provides a greater legal basis for the protection of our national currency and credit, and has great significance for wartime financial policy. The full text of the ordinance is as follows: Provisional Ordinance on Punishing the Counterfeiting of Legal Tender in Wartime Article 1: Anyone who counterfeits legal tender with the intention of using it shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than seven years, and may also be fined up to 100,000 yuan. Article 2: Anyone who… shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than five years, and may also be fined up to 30,000 yuan. Anyone who alters legal tender with the intention of profiting shall be punished in the same manner as in the preceding paragraph. Article 3: Anyone who commits the crimes in Article 1 or Article 2 shall have the counterfeit or altered currency confiscated, regardless of whether it belongs to the offender. Article 4: Anyone who intends to profit by providing a building or place for the manufacture of counterfeit or altered currency shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years, and their building and all equipment and raw materials used for manufacturing shall be confiscated. Anyone who knows about it and fails to report it shall be punished in the same way. Article 5: Accomplices in this ordinance shall also be punished. Article 6: Those who report facts of counterfeiting legal tender shall be given a reward. The Central Reserve Bank shall separately formulate the reward methods. Article 7: This ordinance shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Change in War Strategy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>German Army Firmly Defends European Fortress</p>
<p>On the day the World War entered its fifth year, there are now two historical developments in Europe, one strategic and the other political in nature. First, let's examine the first point. Since the British and American forces landed in North Africa last November, there has indeed been an important change in the German war strategy. That is, from offensive to defensive, shrinking the supply lines and shortening the battle lines, focusing on strengthening the "European Fortress." Until today. Although the British and American forces have only gained a foothold in one corner of the outer defensive positions of the heavily fortified "European Fortress," they have greatly exaggerated the strategic retreat of the… army, just as if it were a great victory for the anti-Axis forces, and attempted to gain… effects on the Axis camp and neutral countries. In the Soviet Union, however, they took a realistic view and did not positively regard the war results obtained by the British and American forces in North Africa and Sicily as first-class victories. Instead, they advocated that Britain and America should use their boastful "great" combat power to open up a real second front in Western Europe. The Soviet Union even used a threatening tone, saying that if Britain and America hesitated, the Soviet Union would carry out the battle line independently.</p>
<p>Shadows over the Anti-Axis Front</p>
<p>As for the second… new political development, the discord between Britain and America towards the Soviet Union is clearly manifested in the world war situation. The future of the anti-Axis line is filled with shadows. Here, will Britain and America still sacrifice themselves and take a gamble by landing on the European continent? Or would they rather let the Soviet Union withdraw from their own front? Choose one of the two paths. In the Quebec Conference, the Soviet problem became one of the main topics, and it was the most difficult for Britain and America to solve. Over the past few months, Germany has changed its… strategy, proving that the German army did not launch a large-scale summer offensive against the Soviet army on the Eastern Front this year. Regarding the summer operations on this… front, Hanson Baldwin, military reporter for the New York Times, stated in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"Whether Germany or the Soviet Union will take the offensive first in this July summer offensive on the Eastern Front is still a mystery." It also said, "According to reports from the Soviet side, the German army has concentrated 30 divisions in the central part of the Eastern Front, using less than one-third of its total force to launch the initial attack on the Soviet defensive line." In response, German military commentator General Dittmar broadcast on May 30:</p>
<p>"The German army has no intention of re-enacting the Ludendorff offensive operation of 1918. The German army will not take the offensive itself, but let the enemy risk taking the offensive first."</p>
<p>At the time, the anti-Axis front tacitly believed that this was a propaganda strategy by the German army to conceal its final preparations for launching a summer offensive. But as General Dittmar stated, the German army did not launch the large-scale summer offensive that everyone expected, but only launched a localized attack in the central area of the Eastern Front to distract the Soviet army's general offensive.</p>
<p>German Army Changes Strategy</p>
<p>So why didn't the German army launch a large-scale attack on the Eastern Front this summer? The reason is that in order to strengthen the defense of the European Fortress, the German army effectively reorganized its forces in 1943. The British and American people are optimistic about the sluggish military activities of the German army due to the change in strategy, and some even bet that the war can end at the end of this year. However, the heads of the military and political departments hold different views on the future trends of the war. On August 16, James F. Byrnes, Director of the U.S. Office of War Mobilization, with the support of Roosevelt, warned against excessive optimism. He said:</p>
<p>"The great battle has just begun, and there is no reason for it to end soon. Why? Because the anti-Axis forces have so far only fought with less than 7% of all Axis combat troops on the European… battle lines and have gradually gained victory, while the Soviet Union today is facing 48% of the German combat troops. Therefore, the German army has only used less than half of its combat troops in the current battle, and even if Italy withdraws from the battle, Germany's defense will be as strong as its previous offensive. Although the United States has mobilized 90 divisions of its entire force, the German combat troops surpass the anti-Axis forces. In terms of the consumption of military materials, the German army still maintains a… favorable balance. Compared to the damaged equipment, the quantity lost by Germany due to the anti-Axis air force bombing is not as much as the quantity lost by the anti-Axis side due to the German submarine commerce raiders."</p>
<p>Also, Hanson Baldwin's description of the current situation of the German military force in the New York Times on July 18 is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, the German army has a total force of 350 to 360… divisions. Among them, about 46 divisions are garrison troops. Of all the divisions, more than 200 divisions are on the Eastern Front, and there are 20 to 30 divisions of the Axis countries to help. In terms of air power, Germany has 5,000 to 6,000 first-line aircraft, of which about 2,000 are on the Eastern Front. This number is less than half of the total number. There are more aircraft in Western Europe and the Mediterranean than on the Eastern Front. (From: September 3, Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e20">A Visit to the Women and Children's Hospital Outside Ximen, Part Two <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>A Tour of the Research Room</p>
<p>In the internal medicine clinic, there are two medical machines that are rarely seen in Shanghai: a metabolism tester and a cardiac current tester. With these two machines, hundreds and thousands of patients have been spared the suffering of being treated incorrectly and the unjust losses.</p>
<p>The Women and Children's Hospital also has new types of treatment tools such as diathermy electrotherapy machines and ultraviolet lamps. In the Chengbu Road outpatient clinic, there are also… equipment such as X-ray rooms. In order to ensure accurate diagnosis, proper treatment, and rapid results, they have spared no expense in collecting them in the past few years, even in extremely difficult times. In terms of medicines, they also choose the best, just like the machinery and instruments.</p>
<p>A small pharmacy is manufacturing glucose for injections, distilled water, and other blood transfusion supplies. All medicines purchased from general pharmacies must undergo strict inspection and chemical testing. When deemed necessary, they must all be processed. Of course, there is more investment in manpower, time, and money, but it is a great merit for patients! The president shared a long and meaningful story, saying that if someone needs a blood transfusion, the blood type is usually stated and supplied by the blood transfusion center. Once, the need for type A was stated, but the blood supply that came was tested and proved not to be type A. Upon further questioning, it turned out that the person designated by the blood transfusion center had gone to pull a rickshaw halfway. They just randomly pulled a acquaintance to supply blood! If it weren't verified, wouldn't there have been a mess?</p>
<p>In the pathology research room, all patient diagnosis and treatment records are preserved, especially many… disease specimens are displayed on the shelves on both walls, most of which are in obstetrics and venereal diseases, such as the placenta of triplets, deformed fetuses, the… cord that tied itself in a knot in the mother's womb, giant… infants with limb shrinkage, enlarged heart with syphilis, diseased lungs of children with holes,… … the appendix, etc. According to…, many medical students and interns come here to visit and study. For those who provide autopsies on patients or the deceased, there is a particularly generous reward… method. In the past, the hospital even donated coffins, but now, of course, they are unable to do so.</p>
<p>The "Family" of Life-Saving Women</p>
<p>In the Women and Children's Hospital outside Ximen, a group of women dedicated to saving lives are united, forming a "family of life-savers." The highest authority is the board of directors, and the directors are all loyal Christians, such as Zheng Ganxin of the Baptist Church (Chairman), Cao Sun Suxin of the Methodist Church, and Mrs.… Yuannen of the Women's Public Church, but they also specially invite ladies and misses outside the church who are enthusiastic about social undertakings to participate as… directors. Since mid-December of the year before last, all administrative matters have been handled by the Chinese women's organization Executive Committee. There are more than 130 service personnel in the entire hospital, including 17 doctors, 22 head nurses, 43 nursing students, 14 staff members, and 38 workers. Except for one surgeon and a few staff members and workers, all are women.</p>
<p>The president of the Women and Children's Hospital,…, is an enthusiastic and capable Christian who graduated from Cornell University Medical School in 1925. After returning to China, she served as an internal medicine doctor in the hospital. From 1927 to 1941, she served as a professor of internal medicine at the Shanghai Women's Medical College. Since last year, she has served as the president of the hospital and a special internal medicine doctor. The attending physician of internal medicine is the vice president, Huang Huigan. The attending physician of gynecology is Li Songxian, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Medical College. The attending physician of pediatrics is also Huang Shuqiong, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's Medical College. The attending physician of obstetrics is Huang Defang, a graduate of Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College. The director of the pathology room is Deng Yulan, who went to the University of California in the United States for internship in 1931 and served as a pathology assistant at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia in the United States. In 1933, she returned to China and served as a pathology professor at Shanghai Women's Medical College and St. John's University. At that time, she joined the hospital as the director of the pathology room. In surgery, there is Fan Shijun, who graduated from the Women's Medical College in 1926 and then went to the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in the United States to specialize in otolaryngology. She has served as a full-time physician in Shanghai Linsheng, Shang… , Renji, and the hospital as a special physician in the two departments. … Zu…, the only male physician in the hospital, graduated from the Medical Department of Shandong University and has served as a surgeon in Nanjing… Hospital. … The head nurse, Zhang Zu…, graduated from the Xiehe Nursing School in 1929 and immediately became the head nurse of the hospital. She was also a teacher at the Shanghai Xiehe Nursing School. Since 1935, she has served as the head nurse of the hospital and the principal of the Xiehe Nursing School.</p>
<p>Although the doctors and employees all have brilliant academic qualifications and experience, they all embrace the spirit of sacrifice and service. Because the hospital has always aimed to save the poor and sick, it has never had a surplus in economic terms. The treatment of employees is very meager, with the highest salary being 500 yuan. The meals are usually two congees and one rice, with several bowls of vegetarian dishes, which are the same for everyone. Therefore, they help and encourage each other and strive to improve the… services and the… closeness of medical services. There are no factional or exclusionary phenomena, and they love each other like a big… family.</p>
<p>Features and Problems</p>
<p>The president said that the hospital is a charitable hospital, and the biggest feature is that all patients, rich and poor, are treated equally. Even for free patients with very serious conditions, as long as there is a breath left, they never care how much the medicine costs and still do their best to treat them. The poor and sick who urgently need surgery are sometimes operated on quickly even if they have not paid a cent, and treatment is not delayed because the payment procedures have not been completed. What is worth mentioning is that each department has full-time physicians and resident physicians of high and low levels. When patients need emergency treatment or surgery and need many people to rescue them, they often cooperate fully until the rescue is completed. The low mortality rate of those who seek medical treatment, without asking questions outside the scope of the department, is by no means accidental. Today, it is worthy of being the most ideal hospital.</p>
<p>Speaking of the economic situation, the… president stated that because third-class beds account for three-quarters of the total number, the current income is not enough to cover the expenses, and they have always relied on domestic and foreign donations to make up for the shortfall. Since December of the year before last, foreign donations have been completely cut off. Occasionally, some… people in the city donate some, but there are many poor and sick, and expenses are increasing day by day. It is estimated that the average monthly income from January to June of this year is 120,000 yuan, while the expenditure alone on food has reached 110,000 yuan (35… of rice per month, 600 catties of noodles, 172 catties of oil, 120 bundles of firewood, 2 tons of coal per month in summer and 15 tons per month in winter, and 10,000 to 10,000 yuan per month for vegetables). The salaries and allowances of service personnel are more than 20,000 yuan, and rent, housing donations, water and electricity, and equipment and printed matter cost about 30,000 yuan per month. Medicines cost 30,000 yuan per month. In total, there is a shortfall of several thousand yuan per month. Moreover, many medicines and… medical equipment still have to be sought on the black market. Surgical gloves required for ordinary surgery cost more than 4,000 each (each pair can only be used two or three times, calculated with four people each time), and the suture thread (catgut), each… is only 50 inches long, and the selling price of twelve tubes is already 4,500 yuan. In addition, the consumption of gauze, cotton, and baby diapers is very large, so it often costs… thousands to tens of thousands of yuan to treat one patient. If they don't have enough of their own strength, they don't dare to accept them, which is so unsettling!</p>
<p>In January of this year, a petition was submitted to the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association for a subsidy. Mr. Ji Zhendong went to investigate and believed that it met the standards and approved the supplement. It is estimated that by the end of August, a total of 10,000 yuan had been donated for the first time, and the total donation from hospitalized patients was about 30,000 yuan. The Shanghai Primary School Teachers Medical Aid Fund was 10,000 yuan and 20,000 to 30,000 yuan was borrowed from other… With these incomes, more poor and sick people have been treated in the past few months, and the… difficulties of the hospital have been slightly reduced. Concentrating social forces and developing social undertakings is so exciting! (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Shanghai Central News Agency) The… Italian… postal ship Conte Verde (18,765 tons), in June last year, was temporarily used as the first exchange ship between Japan and the United States, anchored and left Shanghai on the 29th to travel to South Africa's… … Somalis Harbor.

<p>Ship Sinks to River Bottom in Thirteen Minutes</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM that morning, the ship received the news of the surrender of the Badoglio government. At 7:05 AM, it gathered all the crew members, more than a thousand people, and performed the final political system for the ship. It then opened the hatches at the bottom of the ship, and all personnel retreated. It sank to the bottom of the river in just thirteen minutes, with only the stern exposed to the right. The world's… large postal ship, which used to… appear in the turbid waters of the Huangpu River with its pure white hull, has now met its tragic fate.</p>

<p>(… Central News Agency) It was learned on the 9th that the news of Italy's… withdrawal from the Axis camp coincided with the National War Memorial Day of China. The expression of Shanghai did not change at all… There are about 600 Italian overseas Chinese remaining in Shanghai. In addition, there are about 1,000 crew members of the commercial ship Conte Verde and about 240… of the… Western Marine Corps, which is a very small number. In addition to public… organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Association, radio station, Stefani News Agency branch, and… schools, etc., its economic interests are much smaller than those of Britain, the United States, and Japan, so its rebellious actions have not had the slightest impact on Shanghai.</p>

The remaining white fox furs will be valued by the Tian Fa Xiang Fur Shop, the famous wines will be valued by Committee Member Wu Huanru, and old banknotes, antiques, and books will be valued by Wang Hanliang. Gift certificates will be sold at their original price, with each item clearly marked. A three-day exhibition will be held in the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for charity sales.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e23">Personnel Must Be Dedicated: Expectations for the New Grain Agency <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's report, the Grain Control Committee will be established by the end of the month at the latest. Director Yuan Ludeng will convene a meeting of all committee members within days to discuss preparatory steps and issues such as grain procurement, transportation, and distribution.</p>
<p>We do not wish to criticize the announced committee members, whether they are incumbent officials, social leaders, or grain industry tycoons. Our only hope is that everyone must thoroughly understand the importance of grain administration in relation to people's livelihoods, that managing grain administration is serving the public, and, more importantly, relieving the public's suffering. They must clearly recognize this goal and mission, and under any difficult or tempting adverse circumstances, never be afraid to shy away or be tempted, and always maintain a courageous, upright, and honest service spirit.</p>
<p>Secondly, given the repeated failures of past grain administrations, the root cause lies in "poor planning." Therefore, personnel issues should be the primary concern of the new agency. We have repeatedly argued that the selection of middle and lower-level cadres in the new agency must be based on strict screening, selecting people for the job, and never indulging in favoritism or having unqualified people fill positions. This will not only fail to achieve success but will also lead to failure. The entire food supply of the people cannot be a trivial experiment for a few.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we reiterate that the new agency's employment of personnel should be absolutely full-time, with no concurrent positions allowed, to ensure responsibility and prioritize performance.</p>

<p>After the authorities authorized the Dazhong Lianmei Coal Company to be responsible for the distribution of various types of briquettes and white coal, the implementation of various measures has been relatively smooth. However, recently a small number of businesses have dared to deliberately violate the regulations and sell these allocated coal supplies at inflated prices, which not only fails to uphold the purpose of suppressing and stabilizing prices. It is reported that Dazhong Lianmei Coal Company has sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association, urging them to notify all businesses to distribute coal on schedule and absolutely not overcharge, or else they will be punished by the authorities according to law. It is also reported that the authorities have already allocated the quantities for the third batch of livelihood coal. All participating businesses must pay and take delivery of the goods within the specified time limit. Any intentional delays will be considered a waiver of their rights.</p>

Therefore, the Lianbao authorities have notified each Baojia head to instruct self-defense guards not to stand guard shirtless. Any self-defense guards with improper attire or listless spirits will be rectified.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Special City Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, recently unscrupulous individuals have frequently used the name of this branch to conduct investigations in various dance halls, restaurants, and taverns for the purpose of defrauding people and collecting money. This type of behavior is extremely illegal. This committee has never sent anyone to conduct investigations. Even personnel from the branch have specially issued credentials from this branch. In the future, should you encounter the above, please pay attention and ask the investigators to present their credentials. If they are false, you may directly take them to the police station for investigation to eliminate traitors.</p>

<h3 id="e36">A Garden for Industrial and Commercial Economy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange will soon open amidst the increasingly loud drumbeats and gongs. We feel that the focus of wartime economic problems lies in how to invigorate economic enterprises; the focus of invigorating economic enterprises lies in how to prosper the industrial and commercial economy. The industrial and commercial economy is the lifeblood of the entire wartime economy and must not be stagnant or unbalanced. At the same time, the industrial and commercial economy is like flowers and plants in a forest. To make it flourish, it must be fertilized by increasing the circulation of various production securities, and the ground for its prosperity and growth is the securities exchange.</p>
<p>This newspaper's editorial previously stated: "The greatest purpose of restoring the securities exchange is to bring securities trading onto the right track to assist the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry." Why do we say this? Because Chinese stocks are a type of security that represents the assets of Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises. Their circulation is the circulation of funds for industrial and commercial enterprises; further, it is the increase in the production of industrial and commercial enterprises. Due to the circulation of Chinese securities, the utilization of social funds that was previously not suitable for national purposes can now be used for the wartime economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese Securities Exchange is a garden for our industrial and commercial economy. What it can reap is certainly not only the interests of the stock market but also the interests of the entire production sector. Because what is being cultivated and irrigated in this garden are the funds for industrial and commercial production enterprises, we believe that in terms of gardening, careful research is indeed necessary, and the management of the garden must be scientific.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Trade Associations Should Still Join Local Chambers of Commerce: Ministry of Industry Has Given Detailed Explanation <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Federation of Commercial Control and its lower-level organizations, various industry associations have always participated in local chambers of commerce as members. Regarding the organizational relationship of the chamber of commerce, they are now in a state of disconnection. Taking the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce as an example, the members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the past were various industry associations. Since the establishment of the Federation of Commercial Control, after the reorganization of various industry associations, they are now in a state of disconnection with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The newly established industry associations rarely apply to join the chamber, so the annual meeting of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce this year has been postponed repeatedly and cannot be convened yet.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Federation of Commercial Control has sent a letter to the Ministry of Industry some time ago to inquire whether the various industry associations in Shanghai should join the chamber of commerce as members. Recently, the Ministry of Industry has given a detailed explanation of the nature of the Federation of Commercial Control and the Chamber of Commerce, believing that the organization of local chambers of commerce is for the welfare of merchants themselves, while the Federation of Commercial Control and various industry associations are primarily for the distribution of materials. Moreover, the chamber of commerce is organized by region, while the federation is organized by industry, and their purposes and operations are different. Since these industry associations are commercial organizations, they should still join the local chamber of commerce. Therefore, the various industry associations under the Shanghai Federation of Industries should still participate in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members, and the various industry associations in other regions should also join the local chamber of commerce as members.</p>

<p>Since its establishment last year, the Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Food has had the ambition to revitalize the country's fisheries industry. It drafted an outline of a five-year plan for the development of the fisheries industry. When it was under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry approved the plan, which included a plan to establish a fisheries college in the first year to train specialized technical personnel for the country's fisheries industry to meet national needs. According to a person in charge of the administration, although the draft plan for establishing a fisheries college has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Food, the Central China Fisheries Authority, and other relevant parties, it still needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan before preparations can begin. As for the budgetary aspects, there may be some changes.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Employee Salaries After Price Stabilization <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the wartime price increases, those who have benefited are naturally those who own wealth and can take advantage of opportunities to make huge profits. Those who are most threatened are the employees in general industries. Most employees in industries rely on fixed salaries for a living. Prices have soared unlimitedly following a geometric progression. No matter how the salaries or subsidies are adjusted, they are never able to keep up.</p>
<p>Since the salary income of employees in industries cannot be balanced with the prices, they cannot but seek other ways to supplement it, and the sources of funds used for this purpose mostly come from the following ways: 1. Using old savings; 2. Borrowing; 3. Income from speculative activities outside the profession; 4. Relying on the year-end bonuses or year-end rewards from the enterprise they work for; 5. Engaging in fraud.</p>
<p>Although the above first and second items are legitimate sources, the former is because not many employees in industries have savings in peacetime, and even if they do, they can only be used for short-term compensation and cannot be used for long-term supplementation. As for the latter, the source of funds for repaying the principal and interest after borrowing becomes a problem. The third source is engaging in speculative activities outside the profession. Leaving aside the impact of this move on society, employees in industries are relatively familiar with the market situation and can engage in this, but there are also various restrictions. For example, first, they must have some financial resources; second, they must have relatively free time; and third, they must be familiar with people and have the ability to import and export goods. It is true that many employees in industries can meet these conditions, but it can be said that the vast majority of people have no connection with this. As for the first item, relying on year-end bonuses and rewards to make up for it is probably the most common method. Especially the employees in old-fashioned stores, their usual salaries are so low that they almost completely rely on this income. In the past few years, because prices have risen unlimitedly, although the actual sales of various industries are not as good as before, almost all have huge windfall profits due to the appreciation of inventory. Earning money from the people naturally requires sharing some with the employees, which gives the employees some benefit. What about in the future? If prices can be stabilized, windfall profits will naturally disappear, and it will be impossible to rely on this income to make up for the shortage of expenses. The fifth source, illegal, is even more unnecessary to say. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e42">An Overview of the Beijing People's Will Gathering Institution: The New People's Society Beijing Joint Association <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>In North China, the People's Society, in its initial establishment, could be described as a governmental intention institution, with local officials concurrently serving as the highest leaders of the society. It merely served to communicate governmental directives downward, compelling the populace to cooperate with the government's implementation of policies. It was not until last year that the New People's Society altered its system. Throughout North China, there exists the All North China New People's Society Joint Council. In each province and city, there are New People's Society Joint Cooperative Associations. Beneath each province and city lie cellular organizations in each district and county. The Joint Cooperative Associations in each district and county recommend representatives to attend the provincial and municipal consultative conferences, and the provincial and municipal consultative conferences then recommend representatives to attend the All North China New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference. The elected representatives include those from the business community, the press, the educational sector, former officials, representatives of charitable organizations, and impartial gentry. It can be described as a fully representative system of public opinion.</p>
<p>Representative Oath</p>
<p>This year's Beijing Joint Cooperative Association held a meeting on August 29th and 30th. A total of fifty-eight representatives were selected. The venue was the magnificent Huiren Hall. Government officials in attendance included Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee and concurrently President of the New People's Society, Hu Hanqi, Director of the Beijing New People's Society Affairs Department, and Mayor Liu Yushu, along with directors of various bureaus and offices of the Beijing Municipal Government. At the outset of the meeting, Hu Hanxiang, Director of the Municipal New People's Society Affairs Department, delivered an opening address, followed by an instructional address by Wang Kemin, and then a congratulatory address by a friendly country's representative. Before the formal agenda, the assembly appointed a speaker and a deputy speaker. This session's speaker was Ling Fuyuan, President of the New Beijing News, and the deputy speaker was Liang Yaping. Under the speaker's leadership, all the representatives took an oath, which read: "We, the representatives, swear with utmost sincerity to恪遵 (ke zun) the society's guidelines, obey the society's discipline, and to deliberate and examine proposals with integrity, so as to accomplish the mission of the Joint Consultative Conference. We swear."</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>Following the oath, the ceremony concluded and entered the formal process of discussing proposals. The nature of the New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference is quite special. Its proposals are not resolutions and carry no binding force. However, all relevant senior officials are present during the meetings, and all representatives of the societies can express their views freely and thoroughly. Sometimes they narrate the suffering of the people, shedding tears, and sometimes they denounce corrupt officials, stamping their feet in anger. After the representatives express their opinions, the responsible authorities concerned are tasked with responding and providing solutions, truly facilitating the upward transmission of popular sentiment and the downward transmission of governmental intention, relying entirely on this conference to bridge the opinions of officials and the people, breaking down all barriers.</p>
<p>Content of Proposals</p>
<p>The proposals of this Beijing Joint Association mostly concern the people's food and livelihood. A separate record of the content of the proposals and their solutions is provided below.</p>
<p>(First Proposal) In order to establish a wartime economic system, please thoroughly implement a low-price policy and encourage the control of food supplies to secure the people's livelihood. As this proposal involves the economic control of all of North China, the review result is divided into two parts for handling. The first part, concerning the overall control and the implementation of direct taxes, will be submitted to the All North China New People's Society Joint Consultative Conference for handling. The second part, concerning price controls, consumption controls, and enterprise controls, will be accepted by the Social Affairs Bureau for on-site resolution.</p>
<p>(Second Proposal) In order to initiate a production increase and people-saving movement, please improve the assessment standards for agricultural products, expand arable land to relieve the poor, and alleviate the people's distress. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Charitable Joint Association will fully accept this proposal, thus resolving it immediately. The measures for this proposal are recorded as follows: The competent authorities should establish a special institution to reward agricultural production to assist in its success. The standards for evaluating agricultural products should be improved, and prizes should be increased. Both the Civil Affairs Society and the governmental side should guide the public to voluntarily develop planting, and those whose achievements are evident should be commended. The government should allocate land for active development and implement work-for-relief programs. Funds should be used to establish factories and expand civilian shelters, selecting middle-aged and strong individuals from beggars to be laborers. The measures for this will be formulated jointly by the Municipal Government and the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce together with the North China Labor Association.</p>
<p>(Third Proposal) In order to adjust the current industry, promote municipal loan agencies, and clarify regulations for private lending, alleviate the people's difficulties. After deliberation, the result is to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.</p>
<p>(Fourth Proposal) In order to increase the welfare of civil servants and promote consumer cooperative enterprises, please urgently establish a North China Civil Servants Consumer Cooperative and gradually extend it to the general public. After deliberation, All China Joint Association</p>
<p>(Fifth Proposal) In order to absorb idle capital and revitalize industry, national savings should be promoted and factories for essential goods should be established to promote thrift and benefit the people's livelihood. After deliberation, the result is to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.</p>
<p>(Sixth Proposal) Regarding the request to the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly prohibit stores (?) from raising rents, so as to prevent citizens from sleeping in the streets, harming public image, maintaining morality and rectifying public order, and preventing the breeding of abuses. Measures one and two of this proposal have already been accepted by the Public Security Bureau. The decision for the third measure is to continue implementing the past rationing method, but it must be sold in installments to benefit the poor, and the cost of printing ration tickets will be included in the sales price.</p>
<p>(Seventh Proposal) Regarding the encouragement of honest government to consolidate the national foundation, after deliberation, it is believed that there is unanimous agreement in principle, but two measures should be amended as follows: Allow people to report offenses and the government should effectively protect them, but malicious false accusations are not allowed. Request the government to promulgate provisional regulations for the emergency punishment of corrupt officials and general civil servants who commit offenses, with severe penalties including the death penalty and confiscation of their property. This proposal is submitted to the All China Joint Association.</p>
<p>(Eighth Proposal) The matter of eradicating opium addiction is related to the survival of the nation, hence there was a heated debate at last year's All-Association meeting. And the highest authorities also have the deepest determination to ban drugs. But to this day, opium dens are still densely distributed, which is inevitably contradictory, so delegate Li Zhuangfei of the assembly again put forward a thorough ban on drugs to protect the national physique, and delegates Cheng Xixian and Kuang Junyong spoke passionately, advocating the closure of opium dens, but because this issue is not a problem for one city, the Speaker ruled to submit it to the All-Association.</p>
<p>(Ninth Proposal) Regarding the investigation of coal storage to avoid coal shortages and prevent problems before they occur, the representative explained the reason, saying that coal merchants often take advantage of the high cost of living to violate official prices. If official prices are set according to the cost of living, then there is no excuse, and violators should be punished, and put forward measures. Investigate storage, publicly announce paper, issue orders that are followed, ensure the adequacy of weights and measures, and restrict the export of raw coal. This proposal concerns the lives of citizens greatly, and it was decided to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling.</p>
<p>(Tenth Proposal) Use the name of the assembly to send a letter to the transportation authorities requesting an increase in the amount of food that passengers carry and a reduction in freight to benefit the people's food supply. It also put forward arguments that won applause on the spot, and it was decided to transfer it to the Renmin Committee for handling and bring it up with the relevant authorities as soon as possible. Reason: The difficulty in obtaining food in Beijing is increasing day by day. Although the authorities are trying their best to plan, it is still difficult to find new sources. The ration of mixed grains is gradually decreasing. At present, each person can only buy half a catty per day, but sometimes they cannot buy it in full. This situation has a great relationship with the lives of the two million people in the city. It is also of great importance to public security. The most heatedly debated issues today and the issues that take the most time are nothing more than the people's food problems, and what the representatives are asking for is nothing more than how the authorities can smoothly distribute it. How to increase the source of food in the city, two major principles, but these two major problems have never been satisfactorily answered. In view of this, this seat believes that instead of seeking answers for a long time, it is better to seek them from the assembly itself, and use the name of the assembly to call on the transportation authorities and request various conveniences for passengers carrying food to increase the source of food in the city to supplement the lack of official source-opening measures. Measures: Increase the amount of food that passengers carry, reduce the burden of carrying food, and strictly prohibit exploitation by road police. (Yi Quan's dispatch on September 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e43">A Treasure Trove of Spiritual Food for Children: A Visit to the Children's Library <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The importance of children's education surpasses that of adult education. The success or failure of adult education is actually based on the quality of children's education. The Chinese people have traditionally lacked emphasis on children's education. Children do not have proper spiritual food to satisfy their hunger and thirst, which has led to the strange phenomenon of competing to watch comic strips on the streets, filling their pure minds with corrupt impressions of "monsters and demons."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library came into being because of this need. It was founded on Children's Day in the 29th year of the Republic by eleven groups, including the China Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Street Children's Education Association, the Children's Welfare Association, and the Labor Bureau's Children's Protection Section, as well as public-spirited individuals. It was officially established on July 14th of the 30th year at the Dahua Commercial Plaza on Jing'an Temple Road. Its purpose is to instill good knowledge and education in children and provide children with sound spiritual food. It is China's only children's library that assists children's education and cultivates good citizens. It has a collection of more than two million books, and it is estimated that no less than 150,000 people have read it for free in the past two years.</p>
<p>In addition to providing free reading to children who come to the library, the library has also formulated rules for individual and group borrowing in order to be more universal and convenient. It is also completely pragmatic, charging only a very small reading fee and a refundable deposit. According to the library's statistics, the number of books borrowed each month is around 54,000. Recently, the number of schools and organizations applying for borrowing from the library is still increasing sharply. (There are many locations now)</p>
<p>In addition, many book circulation stations and mobile library vehicles have been set up in the city. The purpose of the book circulation stations is to facilitate borrowing for children in remote areas. Like a small branch of the library, the borrowing procedures are the same as those of the library. Four mobile library vehicles travel around to various places every day, so that ordinary poor children who are wandering on the streets can also have a chance to read. Whenever the mobile library arrives, there are always many pitiful children surrounding the mobile library, which shows how urgent they feel the need for spiritual food, and also shows that it is necessary to expand and popularize this work.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the development of the library's services, the original site is no longer sufficient. It is planned to purchase a house in Lin Village as a new library site, but the price is 250,000 yuan. It is impossible for the library to bear this amount. Therefore, Mr. Fang Zijun, a director of the library, donated the calligraphy of his son, Fang Wenjun, to the library for display and exhibition on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association as a charity sale. All proceeds will be used to purchase the library building.</p>
<p>It is still a long way off for a small calligrapher to be able to bear this considerable expense with his charity income, but it is commendable that a child of only thirteen years old can fulfill such a responsibility. Therefore, it is hoped that all enthusiastic people in the city who are interested in children's education will provide more assistance so that they can use their joint efforts to promote its completion.
