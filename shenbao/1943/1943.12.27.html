<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">貢獻給物價評議會 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>市府為統一管理物價，成立物價評議委員會，以經濟局長為主任委員，各有關機關領袖為委員，旨在集思廣益，謀物價之合理解决。本月上旬曾開會一次，現以物價漲風狂熾，人民生活益感威脅，日前復召集臨時會議，討論緊急措置辦法。我們願以幾點切合實際的意見，貢獻給評議會作為參考：</p>
<p>物品限價辦法，在租界未收回以前即已實行。不但各種商品都有定價公佈，並且雇用大批男女調查員逐日出外調查，而其結果，除了少數較大百貨公司，因有標價關係，不得不將一部份商品按照限價出售外，其餘一般商店，可說是無一處不仍售黑市。調查員有的是不能盡職，有的是雖能盡職，但不能終日坐守一店，以致價格雖有規定，黑市依然猖獗。所以該會今後所應注意的，並不僅在價格之如何限定，而在限價之如何執行，方能使人民確實得到限價之利益。</p>
<p>前工部局的限價辦法，種類太多，名目太繁，實不必耍，我們主張嗣後限價商品種類，應以生活日用必需品為限，庶範圍縮小，稽考易於周密。</p>
<p>近日以來漲風最劇者，首推煤球，其次則為米，因為米煤都是人民生活所必需，於是影響到一般商品及勞力無不上漲，有效的平抑物價辦法，應該從速實施煤球配給，並增加戶口米數量，使人民生活安定恐怖心理消滅，則一切物價，可以不抑自平</p>
<p>工業品的上漲，固然受到煤米價格的影響，其實還有一個更重大的原因，就是自從電力公司限制用電以後，無論業內業外，都看到生產更將减少，物價更將上漲，紛紛從事搜購團積，標本兼治辦法，應該一面重申業外不得購貨之禁令，責任各同業公會切實遵照辦理；一面由市政當局與電力公司切實交涉，重新調整工廠用電限度，以維持現有之生產率。</p>
<p>區域以內物品自由流通，為戰時物資移動取締暫行條例所規定。市政當局亦會二令五申，不得留難。但事實上仍多未能切實遵行，以致增加商民負担，提高商品成本。如煤球商人，即多以此為藉口。該會應即建議市府，多派高級警務人員，微服密查，遇有不遵法令騷擾商民者，必須隨時從嚴處分，减輕商民負担，即所以抑平物價。</p>
<p>其次關於評價工作本身，我們也有幾點意見：第一，評價應以生產成本為根據，而計算成本，非專家莫辦。故宜由評議會分別組織專門委員會，延聘學識兼優，品行公正之專家主持其事，至評議會本身，則祗應抱客觀的態度，不應有主觀的成見。第二，評價太高，固屬加重人民負担，但是評價太低，影饗到生產，或迫使商民隱匿其貨物，致供求失去平衡，物價上漲，結果還不是一樣使消費者受影饗。所以評價之際，對於生產者以及販賣商之利潤必須顧到。第三，評價有效的期間，應酌中規定，非有特別變化，不輕予更改。第四，評議會應多設特約調查人員，隨時供給情報。第五，也是最後的一點，更希望評議會能與「切執行機關，密切聯繫，通力合作。</p>

<p>瑞典京城廿六日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦消息：英國半官通訊社評論，任命艾森霍華將軍為反軸心軍攻歐總司令，及任命蒙高茂萊將軍為英加軍司令之措置，視為耶誕節之驚人消息，但各報於卅六小時內不致加以評論。該社軍事訪員勃樞，以為進攻歐陸已為期不遠，美國方面宜稱·第二戰綫於「九十日內」將有所行動，英國境內之反軸心軍已有所準備，但不若艾森霍華與蒙高茂萊担任新職之東要。倫敦方面以為美軍及歐洲各國逃亡政府之軍隊均將另設司令，盛傳進攻歐陸之空軍將另由一人負責調整，海空軍將設司令，此項消息可</p>
<p>柏林廿六日中央社電　海通社訊：關於艾森霍華將軍被任為反軸心軍攻歐總司令一事，德國負責人士迄木發表評論。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據海通社訊。華盛頓消息；美參議員詹森根據「極可靠方面」之情報宣稱，進攻歐洲之反軸心軍兵額，美軍將佔百分之七十三，此一比數必將使美人震驚，但余亦不欲質問此項决議之戰略價值，按詹森亦係美參院軍委會之委員。</p>

<p>阿姆斯特丹二十六日中央社電　據華盛頓訊：羅斯福總統於聖誕節之演說中稱，謂反軸心方面仍將受重大之損失，美軍會經在所羅門·吉爾貝特，及突尼西亞。義大利諸役之後，現知將有更大及更犧牲之戰事仍在進行，戰事現巳達到反軸心軍準備重大犧牲之階段，現無輕易致勝之道路，而戰爭之結果仍未能望見，在總統出國之旅行中，所接見之人員，均謂軸心軍將士之能力實極優越，羅斯福總統末評一部份美人以為戰爭已近結東而反軸心已戰勝，此種思想係屬錯誤</p>

<p>阿廷根京城二十六日中央社電　據紐約電：美國鐵路工人總罷工事件尚朱解决之際，又發生鋼鐵工人罷工事件，致美國軍需產業中樞之鋼鐵工業，將陷於麻痺狀態。按美國勞工問題於本年七月起遭遇空前之不安，緣美國工團會議系之鋼鐵勞動公會與各鋼鐵公司成立之工資契約，於二十四日夜半已吿期滿，同時該公會所屬工人即陸續開始罷工，備俄亥俄州四鋼鐵工塲已有工人四萬於二十六日起罷工，致製鋼工塲及鐵板鐵管工廠等不得已而中止工作，此外賓夕法尼亞州之桀南哥熔鑛爐公司·俄亥俄州哈巴特銬型鐵公司工塲之工人，亦同樣開始罷工，又其他地區鋼鐵工廠之大部因聖誕節休假，工人之態度如何尚不明。然據觀二十六日若不發生新事態，公會所屬工人將自二十七日（星期一）起一齊罷工，全美五百家鋼鐵公司工人三十五萬或實行全面總罷工。</p>

<p>柏林廿六日中央社電據　海通社訊：美第五軍於聖誕假期內，在義南沿米納諾卡西諾公路，發動堅强之新攻勢，其目的似欲征服該處德軍之基要陣地，打開卡西諾前綫之平原，然後可出動坦克車作戰，至美軍此舉是否為將在義南前綫之西部發動大攻勢之先聲，則尚待以後之發展而定。東部激戰則在奧索格那（〇rsogna）奧爾托納（Ortona）公路一帶進行中，蒙高茂萊在該處軍隊企圖自奧爾托納迤西突入德軍防地，英軍源源開入奧爾托納城，現正展開激烈巷戰，該路西端之奧索格那城則仍在德軍手中，協約軍一再進犯，均為吾軍予以重創擊退。</p>

<p>北京，近來因為當局取締囤積投機，一般囤積家己不能如前此那樣的獲利，而大走紅運的則是信託事業。</p>
<p>新興的信託事業</p>
<p>所謂信託事業就是一般的委託商店，年來非常的活動，沒有不大獲利潤的。現在是一般投織商店也假偕了委託的名義，因為這一類委託商店，不論資金多少都可以活動，資力雄厚的碰到低廉而容易銷售的貨品就自行購買，一轉手之間，就可以獲到重利。如果碰到價昻而不容易出脫的貨物就代客銷售，不論道貨品是好是壞，銷路如何。這種辦法只有賺錢，而絕不會虧本。甚至於一般幹囤積勾當的商民，無處銷售貨品，也只好委託這此商店代售，而這些商店也就可以乘機在市價步昻的時候按定價或較低市價收買，而行轉售。</p>
<p>據說最近五六月之間，新組及附設的信託商行，規模較大的己經有二十餘家之多，其地資力單薄不為社會所注意的更是不少。最令人尋味的就是一些宗敎國體也都來幹，女靑年會每星期一次代客拍買，史家胡同的一個基督敎團體每天也都有幾個特派員在那裹給人買賣各色各樣的貨品。這些機關甩了慈善事業的名義，實際上獲利是比較一般商店更高的，因為他們可以不必納稅。這的確是戰時經濟的另一姿態。</p>

<p>不知道自什麼時候起、「週」已變成了一個普通的名詞。最近這一週的週是呌做獻銅週。這是由北京市金品獻納委員會决定的，日期自人日起至十五日止，實施市民獻銅運動週，並通令凡屬銅類，無許可者，一律禁止出城出境，嚴禁當舖收受銅類當品。這幾天來我們已經看見許多警察到市民家中按戶通知，說是每戶必得獻銅二斤有半，而市塲上的銅價也就隨着高漲。這樣的結果，獻銅運動的成功總是可以預想得到的吧。（十二月十五日寄）</p>

<h3 id="c27">現階段米糧統制工作的癥結 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 敬遠</p>
<p>米糧統制，是一件要事，也是一件難事。辦得好，可以成為仁政德政，辦得不好，也可成為苛政虐政。米糧統制委員會成立以來，成　未彰，只是因為期待之殷，乃亦不覺其責備之切。同時希望米統會當局，能够把困難的　結所在，提不出來，揭出問題的焦點，一方面可以給人以可諒的原因，一方面也可以使大家合力帮忙，共同努力，以期難關的突破。</p>
<p>據我們所知，今日米糧統制工作所以發生阻滯，不能獲得圓滑順利的結果。最重要的不外下列幾個原因；</p>
<p>第一·機構問題　米統會原是全國米糧統制的最高機構，米統會的執掌，是採辦，是運輸，是儲配，亦經行政院明令頒佈。米統會旣經政府賦給上述的權力，就應該充分的運用。如果上述各端，有不能令人滿意的地方，社會方面，亦惟知唯米統會是問，米統會亦無法推諉。據前日米統會富局發表的消息，稱運輸儲配工作，歸上海糧食調整會辦理，我們相信這種駢枝的現象，决非米糧統制健全的象微，希望有關當局，能够迅連會商，加以調整。</p>
<p>第二·人事問題　在米糧成為奇貨的今日，米統會就給一般不肖份子認為利　，營私舞弊的情形，最易發生。所以各界對於該會的人事問題，莫不寄以更大的關懷。該會成立以後，即發現種種人物，包國於該會上下各級職員之側，施展伎倆，希冀獲得意外的滿足。所以該會職員如非意志堅定修　有素者，即難免其動搖。近來巳有數案發生，聞正在澈查之中。為永杜後患起見、宜速舉辨通保切結，假定以五人為一組，一人犯法，四人連坐，從嚴懲處。尤其是掌握重權的高級職員，更應以自吿奮勇的態度，欣然立具該項切結，以表示其純潔和公正，則上行下效，當可造成廉潔的風氣。</p>
<p>第三·運輸問題　運輸工作是米糧統制的重要關鍵，同時也是最複雜最困難的一環。據前日報載，米統會的運輸工作現在　歸上海市糧食調整會委田華中配給組合辦理，我們且不管這一舉措是否得當，即使就事論事，由華中配給組合獨力負責，確也有許多困難之點。第一是該組合同時承運軍米，有兼顧不　之處，第二是運輸工作在事實上有許多帶規定例，技巧門檻，非外人所可盡悉。每次運輸，其額外費用往往遠超於規定運賃之上，正如各物之有限價與黑市，明知其非而無法避免的。友邦商人，往往因其本國的風習關係，而發生隔膜，以此運輸工作就發生阻礙，證之近月來各地存米山積，甚至有發芽霉爛者，而滬市則接濟困難，窮狀舉露，可見運輸機構，的確有重行考慮調整的必要。</p>
<p>第四·蔴袋問題　蔴袋為運米的重要工具，現在綠綫蔴袋，來源斷絕，存底已少，新貨黑市，開每隻一百五十元以上，而米統會限價，據說在一百三十元左右，因此搜購困難，躭擱起運期限。現聞該會正訂購大批單絲蔴袋應用，雖價格便宜，但折耗旣多，且不經用，不如酌量提髙收價，以應急需</p>
<p>以上數端，祗就今日米糧統制　結所在，抉其耍點，貢獻其解决的途徑，値此滬市民食波濤洶湧的今日，希望大家能够合力起來，共渡難關。本來，任何工作的開端，必有許多障礙和困難，决不能以此為消極的理由，而應以勇氣去克服難關，達於坦途。米糧統制的工作，影響於大東亞後方的安定至大，尤其希望中日雙方，開誠合作，以底於成。</p>

<h3 id="c37">長征十萬浬　某經中歷佐談 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>開戰巳歷二年，敵人圈伏在日木的軍艦旗之前，在這襄建立了磐石之安共榮圈，然而敵人現已開始孤注一擲的總反攻。對此，我一億民衆不能不加以最後的澈底的大打擊。際此大東亞戰爭進入第三年之日，〇〇戰隊參謀某中佐，在開戰之初即參加攻擊美國太平洋艦隊的最大根據地夏威夷珍珠灣，此後並在制覇南北太平洋，印度洋諸戰役中，無役不與，所經之處不下十萬浬。最近返歸〇〇基地。茲談「戰綫十萬浬的感想」如下，以贈努力增强戰力的後方。</p>
<p>攻擊珍珠灣</p>
<p>負起了建國的理想之我艦隊，踏上了四千浬的大征途。十二月入日黎明，「準備出發的命令下來了。海面波浪相當險惡，但珍珠灣那方面大體頗為晴朗。航空部隊的指揮官終於下了大東亞戰爭最初的號令。〇〇架飛機踴躍地向珍珠灣飛去。</p>
<p>送行者虔誠向神祈禱，為了這一天，我海軍飛機隊嘗了許多年的辛苦，相信必定能獲得大戰果。果然，在預定的時問，第一個電報來了：「我奇襲成功」。</p>
<p>在飛機出發之前，即已在艦內用無綫電聽着敵情。這天是星期日，播送着敝會禱吿的聲音。他們在作朝禱：「神祗在美國上面賜予援手。」在預料的海軍機殺到珍珠灣的時刻，無綫電內報吿敵方狼奔豕突的混亂狀態。</p>
<p>「陸軍的某部隊速即　隊！」</p>
<p>「按術者到那襄集合！」</p>
<p>「看　部隊集合這裏，火奴魯魯的全體　師速集合某某方面，受某某的指揮。」</p>
<p>後面末了一句必定是：「爲了光榮的祖國美國！」這最後的話——「爲了光榮的祖國美國」——，使我們深切地認識，在開戰之初，美國也有愛國心。雖然和日本的信念不同，但他們的精神力，也决不能等閑視之。</p>
<p>從夏威夷歸來，在十日晚上，又聽到在數千浬那面的馬來海面，我海軍機擊沉英國遠東艦隊的主力威爾斯親王號消息。</p>
<p>鳳　堂堂連萬里</p>
<p>天誅一喝酬驕兒</p>
<p>轟炸粉碎珍珠灣</p>
<p>袖一觸無敵機</p>
<p>敵於實行這世界戰史上空前大攻擊者，實因有現已逝世的山木元帥之故。出擊夏威夷時，長官激勵說：「毋以敵為小敵，但亦毋以大敵而懼。紙須持有必勝信念。有必勝信念者·毋忘必有天祐神助。」</p>
<p>我們完全相信長官的道必勝信念而就征途。獲悉山本長官在空中指揮中壯烈戰死的情報時，我們愈加　固了山本長官所說的帝國海軍隨時隨地承繼着「常在戰塲」，「必勝的信念」，因而必能獲勝的信念。從珍珠灣歸來，前往報吿時，不過一個月，長官的頭髮，全都蒼白了，連他的臉色也變了。</p>
<p>送我們上夏成夷征途時</p>
<p>眉宇間充滿了必勝的信念。</p>
<p>從夏威夷歸來謁見，</p>
<p>大將的頭巳變白了。</p>
<p>勘定荷印戰役</p>
<p>我們從南方攻擊爪哇，蘇門答臘。因敗績而逃的敵方巡洋艦，驅逐艦，運輸船，接連被擊沉。某艦突然在晚上遭遇美國的巡洋艦，我方顯然以為是敵，但敵方還完全不知道。探照燈照着那裏放第一是敵人，是自己人。發出了「敵？友？」的發火信號。有這樣好的目標，立即被我們瞄準而轟沉了。當時戰敗的敵艦中，有很多人放下了小船逃生。這船中很多美國和英國，荷蘭的士官們。捕獲某小船，問之，巳漂流一星期以上了。</p>
<p>在赤道的無風帶中，無目的地漂流着的他們的情緒，……切實地感到在戰爭中不能不敗。同時，戰勝的我們，則惑謝天威的蔭庇。</p>
<p>印度洋作戰</p>
<p>我〇〇部隊更轉過槍頭來向印度洋進擊。此時戰爭已經開始了五個月，敵人也已有了相當的準備，我們依預定計劃前進的路上，終於發見敵機了。</p>
<p>但此時也可以說似有神助，敵方的哨戒極為拙劣，雖然從正面向我方飛來，但在我們動手之前，還沒有知道。一接觸我方的行動就逃，被我方戰　機追擊，一一落下。降低掃射時，步哨，傳令一一被射死，誠然是愉快的，豪爽的戰事。</p>
<p>印度洋作戰，我方以攻擊應付攻擊，而給與英國極大的打擊。轟炸敵的航空母艦哈密斯號時，哈密斯在非常接近陸　的地方，背負大山，難於發見。且在那地方，被日機發見，轟炸，因為在淺的地方，毫無辦法，祗有命運才能够帮助。這作戰中，山口多聞中將賜與例行的恩賞，那時的功績，誠極偉大。立在艦橋上指揮的英姿，現在猶浮現於眼前</p>
<p>攻擊是最好的防禦。攻擊是戰爭中的第一着，進攻始能有勝利。試看現在的南方的戰鬥。如其從戰略態勢上看，以為日木取守勢，大約不錯。現在南方猶如拉着搭了箭的弓、等敵人來，所以决不能說是守勢。即使說到攻擊，無準備的攻擊是無意義的。早一點從事增强戰力，這是後方的任務。</p>
<p>北方作戰</p>
<p>阿留申的占領是在六月八日。我們以為美國也巳整頓了相當的準備，但阿圖島，某斯加　等，都是一方面的戰事，不流血占領。當時霧非當濃，並也沒有究全的海　，所以航海的確極為困難，登陸地點也不知道。在這種狀態下，我們在濃霧中，於預定時間二十分鐘前，用推測航行法進行什麽也看不見的地方。十八分鐘前，大約距離陸地三千米的地方，一瞬間看見了對面積着白雪的山頭。</p>
<p>黑暗的，且濃霧的晚間，這不是神助嗎？踏着全白的。誰也沒有踐踏過的處女雪面前進的軍靴，以及在白雪的山頂上招展着的紅色軍艦旗，此時的感激，也是决不會忘記的　神的功業，霧中認淸雪的山。雪峰上，豎着威凜的旗幟。</p>
<p>天明後，見到住在阿圖島的奇却可浦部落的阿留特族的情形。我們走近時，他們很靈敏的迅速逃走了。後來聽他們的報吿，在這裏的美國人曾用無綫電向木國通知「日木軍來了」。阿留特族約有四十名，有美國人夫婦二名管理着這裏的政洽及其他一切，他們並用無綫電取得聯絡。美國人的住所，非常華麗，有相當的防寒用具，重油火爐，留聲機等，裝有發電設備，所以祗有他家裝着電燈。</p>
<p>奧此比較起來，阿留特族之存在，實極可憐。在這裏也可以見到美國之無厭的榨取，本年五月二十九日，阿圖島守備隊全體殉難，基斯加在七月末撤退，因基斯加的撤退作戰，我們重又　向阿留申，誠爲感慨無量。在最近的地方聽到阿圖島全體殉難的我們，首先就堅决立下了誓，决定復仇。是我們的軍艦所運輸的山崎都隊。那部隊現在一人也不存了，完全玉碎了。</p>
<p>敵擁大軍迫孤島</p>
<p>屍山血河水染紅</p>
<p>將士殉難北海山</p>
<p>古今忠烈比楠公</p>
<p>基斯加的撤退是極困難的戰役，前後十日問，濃霧不散，軍艦數艘在大霧中行動，彼此不能互見。無綫電當然不能拍發。然而這裹也有天佑，和將士的技倆相配合。天佑之一是大霧濃密，敵人雜於發見，其二，某日之最，在極端的時問中見到太陽，此時各艦都藉以測定了位置。其三，將靠近島時，恰在約一分鐘見到了島的突出部分，艦長並沒有放過這機會，在不到一分鐘的時間，測定了方位。其四，二天之前，敵軍因自行殘殺，不在此地。</p>
<p>終於接近海灣了。此時，約在五百米的地方，見到了灣的入口。而最後的天佑，在進入海灣之後，灣內竟不可思議地甚為晴朗。撤退部隊的登船極為迅速，祗有預定時間的一半就吿竣了。全體登船後出港時，外面澱是濃霧。在這濃霧中平安歸來。撤退部隊的喜悅，接迎部隊的喜悅，那真是非言語所能形容。（翔：譯自十二月七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 葛心</p>
<p>——　開了　筆，我向冷寂的人實，向你的來　，向着窗外一陣陣乞討聲，我想作一個冰花裏的紫紅的微笑。</p>
<p>別說，你也許明白，我希望它像臘梅在　上的　紅，也像孩子在溜冰時的面頰；若　這能使你有愉快而一如着　時般的紅暈，那創可以誇大話說；我竟希　這是你心底的「暖流」了。</p>
<p>許久的歲月，你病了；這宋荒　的病；你說，你曾經要自殺過三次。然而終於是生的留戀戰勝了你；你活着。</p>
<p>我的　吃了一驚！怯懦的你呵，為什麽三次的自殺，還不能奪去你的生命呢？頑强的也終婦是你呵，——你掙扎過死的引誘，一次！兩次！三次！</p>
<p>許些人讚美死，以死像藍衣的少女，那末温柔，那末青靜。試想像一個　詩裏的傳說：在夕陽西下晚風溫青時，一個八十餘幾的老傳這師，望着落日的霞彩，黄金色的深　；那不停的細碎的浪聲，帶着他遠望的目光，滿足的心願，和那低微的歌聲：「上帝與我同居，...」</p>
<p>他寂然入睡了，永永的長眠了。</p>
<p>許些人熱愛死，以死像南方熱烈的木棉；鮮紅的花朶，從狂風暴雨中，站不住最高的枝頭、像鬥牛士的紅巾和紅血、戰死在兇狂裹。他們說裹着黄金甲在鋼鐵的馬蹄下死去是英勇的。</p>
<p>——是的，我也愛那樣的死。若是死在自己的意志裹，而且是為着要自由，要光經，要生得更頑强！</p>
<p>與其像拿破崙般死在荒島上，你是更願意像亞歷山大帝般死在威武的，歡快的新婚之夜吧？與其像莫泊桑般死在慘寂的瘋人院裏，你是更樂於像在　　斯太般死在浩蕩而長遠的追求的路上吧？然而你底來信說，你的自殺祗爲了厭倦，第二，第三個還是厭倦！從　時的　寂使你更感到過往的豪情與狂熱。你說；你向生命買間：為什麽你們活着呢？表情的過往用驕敵吿訴你；兒時的過往以母愛告訴你；職業的過往以教育神聖的光耀告訴你！......</p>
<p>但是你病了，一切希望與愛　都變成無可捉　的空虛。你想奪去你的生命以你自己的手！陰暗像打翻一　　樣的淚池，　死你銀閃的靑春：慈母顫抖在破毀的故鄰的窮困　、病優蝕了她底慈祥的慰語。終於掩殺了你冬天的太陽！——成為沒有母親的孩兒。你驕傲的友人遠去了，帶走了你最愛聽的　聲和有力的扶助。</p>
<p>你病了在做夢，夢見死去了的母現的寒冷，夢見流很着的哥哥在潦倒不堪。在空廣典寂寞中，你說，你巴不得做夢着和他們永在一起。你願深信佛說的虛無與靈魂的故事。你在斗室裹半爾着扣問着　　以時問，囘答你的却是薄慕走過的　　底竹　聲。於是你又想到病院外人生的意義了；會計師　密密行行的賬目活着般，你　想算算人們生活的　　！</p>
<p>是的，因是你　　這世界的灰冷丁；有多少人流　　泊，有多少人靜靜默默地消失；這樣像　作人　嗆作囚車的囚犯般向『死』的刑場走去。然而劊子手都不是天年的終老！然而你最後却又不能　慕那些　終正　，肚滿　肥的是幸福......</p>
<p>我們都明白飢餓的痛苦但又怎末說呢？比我們更不值得生存的不還多　　！我們在咀嚼着寂　。戰爭，　了一切也全成了一切，痛苦的祗是停留與　落；不僅在大地上，也在生命裏。你必須向你的生命追索，是王，是主宰，是忍耐苦門的勝利者；然而却絕非是自殺。</p>
<p>，　外不又有人在乞討囑？乞討者底生命在顫抖的聲音裏，那生命的聲音一直顫抖到殭臥；他在這世界創造了不平的悲哀才休息。</p>
<p>我們是這世界可憐的渺小的追導者，無論在　　裏在物資的貧困裏，若是做夢也何妨呢？但要是追索的夢，總是成功的可喜的。武者小路實篤在母與子裏曾說過：——旅人行路，至　死而後止！</p>
<p>我知道你不會自己扼殺自己的，而你床頭買「來沙兒」的錢也沒有。若然有，你也好分一點給丐者，敎你在那時看到生命的頑强！</p>
<p>東緊　帶面對寒冷，貧困，寂寞和　視，在一片希望的遠　中死去。這其間稱畏老將發掘盡世界上人類的汚穢，愚昧，兒　與　笑的食婪。</p>
<p>於是你得到勝利老的驕傲底喜悅了！不是嗎？</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>孩子病了，有了病，須要看醫生，那是天秤地義的事，何况是一個剛幾月的孩子哩！怎經得起病魔的　折呢？可是看醫生在這個年頭兒並不是一件容易的事，日常生活的高壓，巳感到喘不過氣來，那裏還有錢去看醫生，不看、就只有聽天由命了。</p>
<p>一天二天過去了，孩子的病，仍舊沒有什麽起色，看上去是非請醫生不可了，非請醫生不可，最先要解决的就是錢了，借　？到那裏。　　·？當嗎？東西呢？沒有法子。只好向　內搜索，但被發現而　能變一些錢的，只有一些「飢不可食，寒不可衣」的幾本書。</p>
<p>在挑別之下，終於決定了我的幾個唯一精神之友——書的命運，我帶着它，走向我所　戲的一個舊書攤去，在路上一顆心不知怎的開始沉悶起來，感到一種不可名狀的苦痛，使我再也不忍多瞧牠們一眼，我怎願意拋那多年來憂患相共的朋友呢？我受到牠們的慰益，我並沒有片時忘下，但我為什麽要作這種不義的事呢？不！我不能做，囘去吧！但一囘首，那　在牀上呻吟着的孩子的情形又似銀幕展在我的眼前了，在這種雙重的思維的　襲下，我的身子却不知不覺地接近那舊書攤了。</p>
<p>「喂！這幾本書賣給你要不要？」</p>
<p>「什麽？林先生你也來開玩笑嗎？」那書販不相信似地說。因為我一向只有向他買，却沒有賣給他過，所以當我是來和他開玩笑；可是寃枉了我了，那舊版怎知我此時的心境呢？我那裏有和他開玩笑的雅情逸緻呢？我恨不得將此時的心剖給他看。</p>
<p>真的，不是和你開玩笑，你看一看，値多少錢？」我一面這樣說一面將書遞給他，這他才相信我是真的來賣給他的他接過了書一本一本地翻着，　視着，看丁一回，他就對我說：「林先生！我是喜歡爽快的，况且我們又是老主顧，也不好意思叫你吃虧，實在現在的時候，人們那裏有錢來買這種閒書看，但你來也不能說不要，只好　你當一個義十五元，你，怎麽？」我聽了這話，氣極了，我拿回了書，一聲不　地，一下子就跑了，我的心開始更加寶亂起來了。我想這　書就是把它當廢紙　吧！也許不止這　錢，因此我咒詛那黑心的舊版，太不把人家的東西當東西看了，但我却又悔恨，我不該做這種事，來招致無謂的　侮。</p>
<p>懷着一肚子悶氣，我盲目地東西奔走着，後來在另外的一個書攤上把它　了，我見他給我錢，我的神經開始麻木起來了，這不是我的朋友的永別書是什麽？我呆立着，呀！我的朋友呀！我們永別了！你在我的無情的手掌中把你斷送了，但是誰之罪呢？環境的　追，使我不得不做這種事，朋友呀！你得明瞭我的苦衷，我請你寬恕，別了，朋友！在黯然無言中，我懷了一顆憂鬱的心，離開了那舊書攤。（　移助學）</p>

<p>大賽</p>
<p>大賽已定一月中旬開始，屆時此含有國際性之重要比賽，轟動球國，盛况定下空前。</p>
<p>我中華隊對於此項比賽，自屬格外重視，故巳於當局組織選拔委員，對於選拔選手事宜，慎重考慮、已選定十八健將為中華隊代表。有東華隊九人，張邦綸·李寗·莊友仁·譚福積·韓龍海·戴麟經·賈幼良·孫錦順·李壵。聯誼隊亦九人，劉　漢·李天生·吳祺祥·宋靈聖·瞿永福·鄭英權·許文奎·李義臣·費春華。以委員會諸公卓然之見，經如此選配，自屬無容煩　，况遺珠之憾，在所難免。且據足聯會周君語記者：以後或有補選一二人可能性，唯比賽中决難有十八九人均有機會，雖為未雨綢繆，究有過多之感。總之，此有關國際性之大賽，深願當局對於陣容支配，格外鄭重，更切願各代表，决須捐除成見，一心一意，努力以赴，為國爭光！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Contribution to the Price Evaluation Council <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In order to unify price management, the municipal government established the Price Evaluation Council, with the Director of the Bureau of Economics as the chairman and the leaders of relevant agencies as members, aiming to gather wisdom and solve the price issue reasonably. A meeting was held earlier this month, and now, as the price surge is rampant and people's lives are increasingly threatened, an extraordinary meeting was convened again recently to discuss emergency measures. We would like to offer a few practical opinions to the Council for reference:</p>
<p>The method of limiting the price of goods has been implemented since before the concessions were recovered. Not only have the fixed prices of various commodities been announced, but also a large number of male and female investigators have been employed to conduct daily investigations. As a result, except for a few larger department stores, which had to sell a portion of their goods at the fixed price due to the relationship with the marked price, it can be said that none of the other general stores stopped selling on the black market. Some investigators are unable to fulfill their duties, and some, although able to fulfill their duties, cannot sit in one store all day long. As a result, although prices are regulated, the black market is still rampant. Therefore, what the Council should pay attention to in the future is not only how to limit the price, but how to enforce the limit price, so that the people can truly benefit from the limit price.</p>
<p>The price limit methods of the former Public Works Bureau had too many categories and too many items, which were not necessary. We advocate that the types of commodities with limited prices in the future should be limited to daily necessities, so that the scope can be reduced and the investigation can be more thorough.</p>
<p>In recent days, the most drastic price increases have been in coal briquettes and then rice. Because both rice and coal are necessities for people's lives, they affect the rise in general commodities and labor. An effective way to stabilize prices should be to quickly implement coal briquette rationing and increase the amount of rice per household, so that people's lives can be stabilized and the fear eliminated. Then all prices can be stabilized without suppression.</p>
<p>The rise in industrial products is certainly affected by the price of coal and rice, but there is also a more significant reason: since the power company restricted the use of electricity, both industry insiders and outsiders have seen that production will be further reduced and prices will rise further, so they have been engaged in hoarding. A comprehensive approach should be taken: on the one hand, the ban on non-industry purchases should be reiterated, and all trade associations should be responsible for its implementation; on the other hand, the municipal authorities should earnestly negotiate with the power company to readjust the electricity limit for factories in order to maintain the existing productivity.</p>
<p>The free flow of goods within the area is stipulated in the "Temporary Regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement." The municipal authorities have also repeatedly ordered that no obstacles should be placed. However, in fact, many people still fail to implement it earnestly, which increases the burden on merchants and increases the cost of goods. For example, coal briquette merchants often use this as an excuse. The Council should immediately suggest that the municipal government send more senior police officers in plain clothes to conduct secret investigations. Those who do not comply with the law and harass merchants must be severely punished at any time to reduce the burden on merchants, which is also a way to suppress prices.</p>
<p>Secondly, we also have a few opinions on the price evaluation work itself: First, the price evaluation should be based on the production cost, and the calculation of the cost can only be done by experts. Therefore, the Council should organize special committees to invite experts with both academic knowledge and integrity to preside over the matter. The Council itself should maintain an objective attitude and should not have subjective prejudices. Second, a too high price evaluation will increase the burden on the people, but a too low price evaluation will affect production or force merchants to hide their goods, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and rising prices. The result is still the same: consumers will be affected. Therefore, when evaluating prices, the profits of producers and vendors must be taken into account. Third, the effective period of price evaluation should be moderately stipulated and should not be changed lightly unless there are special changes.

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Youth Students' Poison Elimination Association, in order to work together with youth students across the country to complete the poison elimination work, telegraphed youth students across the country, saying that since the youth students of this capital launched the poison elimination movement on December 17th, they have repeatedly received responses from youth classmates in various places, which has greatly increased our courage. After being inspired, we have listed several points for the information of our classmates across the country. Opium is a sharp knife for destroying the country and exterminating the race, gambling is the root of ruin and bankruptcy, and singing and dancing are poisonous seedlings that lose one's mind and ambition. The three have been poisoning China for a long time, and all enlightened people deeply hate and abhor them. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and our country's participation in the war, the people of the whole country have been practicing wartime production, saving consumption, and increasing production in order to contribute everything to the country. Unfortunately, there are still a few ignorant people who spend their days singing, dancing, swallowing clouds, and spitting fog, shamelessly affecting young compatriots to imitate them, which ultimately leads to the increasingly decline of the national spirit and the increasingly depraved consciousness of young people. If this continues, the country will not only have no talent to be made, but also no soldiers to be used. It is not like climbing a tree to catch a fish to seek the revival of the country and the liberation of East Asia. We are the future pillars of the country, and all hope is on our shoulders. Seeing this phenomenon, we are heartbroken and filled with grief. Therefore, we are gathering the hot blood of tens of thousands of classmates and launching a ruthless total attack on the poisons that hinder the survival of the nation. Our actions are all driven by patriotic feelings. We only hope to use this pure motivation to sacrifice everything in exchange for the revival of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the East Asian nations. Smoke, gambling, and dance are what we consider to be the biggest enemies, so they are at the top of our attack list. From now on, we will work tirelessly to eliminate all poisons from the country until there is not a single opium den, gambling den, or dance hall on the territory of the Republic of China, and no compatriots of the Chinese nation will be eroded by opium, gambling, and singing and dancing again. Then the youth students of the whole country will be fortunate, the Chinese nation will be fortunate, and the future of East Asia will be fortunate.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from London: A British semi-official news agency commented that the appointment of General Eisenhower as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces to attack Europe and the appointment of General Montgomery as Commander of the British-Canadian Forces are regarded as shocking Christmas news, but newspapers will not comment on it within thirty-six hours. The agency's military correspondent, Buchu, believes that the invasion of Europe is not far away. The American side claims that the "Second Front" will take action within "ninety days." The Anti-Axis Forces in the United Kingdom are prepared, but not as much as Eisenhower and Montgomery taking on new positions. London believes that separate commands will be established for the US military and the armies of the European governments in exile. Rumors abound that the air force attacking Europe will be adjusted by another person. There will be commanders for the naval and air forces. This news is...</p>

<p>Amsterdam, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news: In his Christmas speech, President Roosevelt said that the Anti-Axis side will still suffer significant losses. The US military has learned from the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and the Tunisia and Italian campaigns that there will be even greater and more sacrificial battles in progress. The war has now reached the stage where the Anti-Axis Forces are preparing for significant sacrifices. There is no easy road to victory, and the outcome of the war is still not in sight. During the President's trip abroad, the people he met all said that the abilities of the Axis soldiers are excellent. President Roosevelt commented at the end that some Americans think that the war is coming to an end and the Anti-Axis has won. This kind of thinking is wrong.</p>

<p>Artingen, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch: Just as the American railway workers' general strike has not yet been resolved, a steel workers' strike has occurred, which will paralyze the steel industry, the center of the American military industry. The American labor problem has encountered unprecedented unrest since July of this year. The wage contract established between the Steel Labor Union of the American Federation of Labor and various steel companies expired at midnight on the 24th. At the same time, the workers belonging to the Union began to strike one after another. Workers at four steel mills in Ohio, 40,000 in all, went on strike starting on the 26th, forcing steel mills and iron plate and iron pipe factories to suspend work. In addition, workers at the Jelenko Smelting Company in Pennsylvania and the Hubbard Steel Company in Ohio also started strikes. Most of the steel mills in other areas are closed for Christmas holidays, and the attitude of the workers is still unclear. However, according to the 26th, if no new developments occur, the workers belonging to the Union will go on strike together starting on the 27th (Monday), and 350,000 workers in 500 steel companies across the United States will implement a full-scale general strike.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters: During the Christmas holidays, the US Fifth Army launched a strong new offensive along the Minano-Cassino highway in southern Italy. The purpose seems to be to conquer the key German positions there, open up the plains of the Cassino front, and then deploy tanks to fight. Whether this move by the US military is a prelude to a major offensive in the western part of the southern Italian front remains to be seen. The fierce fighting in the east is taking place in the area of the Orsogna-Ortona highway. The troops under Montgomery's command are attempting to break into the German defenses from the west of Ortona. British troops are pouring into the city of Ortona, and fierce street fighting is underway. The town of Orsogna at the western end of the road is still in German hands, and repeated attacks by the Allied forces have been repelled by our army with heavy casualties.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Economic Posture <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Beijing, recently, because the authorities have cracked down on hoarding and speculation, general hoarders have not been able to profit as before, and the thriving business is trust business.</p>
<p>Emerging Trust Business</p>
<p>The so-called trust business is the general consignment store, which has been very active in recent years, and there is no one that has not made a profit. Now, general investment stores are also using the name of consignment. Because this type of consignment store can operate regardless of the amount of capital. If the financial resources are strong, they will buy goods that are cheap and easy to sell, and they can obtain heavy profits in one turnover. If they encounter goods with high prices and difficult to sell, they will sell them on behalf of customers, regardless of whether the goods are good or bad, or how the sales are. This method only makes money, and will never lose money. Even general merchants who are engaged in hoarding have nowhere to sell their goods, so they have to entrust these stores to sell them on their behalf. These stores can also take the opportunity to buy at fixed prices or lower market prices when market prices rise, and then resell them.</p>
<p>It is said that in the recent five or six months, there have been more than 20 newly established and affiliated trust merchants with larger scales, and there are even more that are thin and not noticed by the society. What is most intriguing is that some religious organizations and national organizations are also doing it. The Women's Christian Association holds a consignment auction once a week, and a Christian organization in Shijia Hutong also has several special commissioners there every day to buy and sell all kinds of goods for people. These institutions use the name of charity, but in fact, the profits are higher than those of general stores, because they do not have to pay taxes. This is indeed another aspect of the wartime economy.</p>
<p>Citizens' Copper Donation Week</p>
<p>I don't know when the word "week" has become a common noun. The week this week is called Copper Donation Week. This was decided by the Beijing Municipal Gold Donation Committee. The period is from the day of man to the 15th, and the citizens' copper donation movement week is implemented. And it ordered that all copper types, without permission, are prohibited from leaving the city and leaving the country, and pawnshops are strictly prohibited from accepting copper types of pawn items. In the past few days, we have seen many police officers notifying the citizens' homes door-to-door, saying that each household must donate two and a half pounds of copper, and the copper price on the market has also risen accordingly. With such a result, the success of the copper donation movement can always be expected. (Posted on December 15)</p>

As for the newly stipulated E-card distribution, the quantity is the same as the D-card, but it is limited to once a month. Regarding the cigarette rationing in various places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, after the establishment of the Association's branch offices in various places, the distribution has been generally carried out, but the monthly rationing quantity depends on the local marketing situation.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Crux of Current Grain Rationing Work <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Grain rationing is an important and difficult task. If done well, it can be a benevolent and virtuous policy; if done poorly, it can become an oppressive and cruel one. Since the establishment of the Grain Rationing Committee, achievements have not been evident, but only because expectations are high, the blame is felt keenly. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the Grain Rationing Committee can bring up the difficulties and reveal the focus of the problems, so that, on the one hand, people can understand the reasons and, on the other hand, everyone can work together and strive to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the reason why the current grain rationing work is hindered and cannot achieve a smooth and successful result is mainly due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, the organizational structure problem: The Grain Rationing Committee was originally the highest authority for national grain rationing. The responsibilities of the Grain Rationing Committee are procurement, transportation, storage, and distribution, as clearly promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Since the Grain Rationing Committee has been given the above-mentioned powers by the government, it should fully exercise them. If there are unsatisfactory aspects in the above-mentioned areas, the public only knows to ask the Grain Rationing Committee, and the Grain Rationing Committee cannot shirk its responsibility. According to the news released by Director Fu of the Grain Rationing Committee the other day, the transportation and storage work is handled by the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Association. We believe that this kind of patchwork phenomenon is by no means a symbol of a sound grain rationing system. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can quickly consult and adjust it.</p>
<p>Second, the personnel problem: Today, when grain has become a scarce commodity, the Grain Rationing Committee is regarded by some unscrupulous people as a place for profit, and cases of embezzlement and corruption are most likely to occur. Therefore, all sectors of society are paying more attention to the personnel issues of the committee. Since the establishment of the committee, various characters have been found, surrounding the committee's staff at all levels, displaying their skills, hoping to obtain unexpected satisfaction. Therefore, it is difficult for the committee's staff to avoid being shaken unless they have a firm will and are well-cultivated. Recently, several cases have occurred and are said to be under thorough investigation. In order to prevent future troubles, a system of joint guarantees should be quickly established. Assuming that five people are in a group, if one person violates the law, the other four will be held jointly responsible and severely punished. In particular, senior staff who hold important powers should take the initiative to sign such guarantees to show their purity and impartiality. Then, the higher-ups will set an example for the lower-level staff, which can create a clean and honest atmosphere.</p>
<p>Third, the transportation problem: Transportation is a key link in grain rationing, and it is also the most complex and difficult link. According to a report the other day, the Grain Rationing Committee's transportation work is now entrusted to the Huazhong Distribution Association by the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Association. We will not comment on whether this move is appropriate or not. Even if we just discuss the matter on its merits, it is indeed difficult for the Huazhong Distribution Association to be solely responsible. First, the association is also responsible for transporting military rice, and there are overlaps. Second, there are many unspoken rules and skills in transportation work that outsiders cannot fully understand. Each time, the extra expenses often far exceed the stipulated freight rates, just like the fixed price and the black market price of various goods. It is known that this is wrong but unavoidable. Merchants from friendly countries often have misunderstandings due to their national customs, which hinders transportation work. As evidenced by the fact that rice has been piled up in various places in recent months, even sprouting and rotting, while Shanghai is experiencing difficulties in supply and revealing its poverty, it can be seen that the transportation mechanism indeed needs to be reconsidered and adjusted.</p>
<p>Fourth, the burlap sack problem: Burlap sacks are an important tool for transporting rice. Currently, the supply of green line burlap sacks has been cut off, and the existing stock is small. The black market price for new goods is over 150 yuan per sack, while the Grain Rationing Committee's limited price is said to be around 130 yuan, making it difficult to purchase and delaying the start of transportation. It is now heard that the committee is ordering a large number of monofilament burlap sacks for use. Although the price is cheaper, the depreciation is high and they are not durable. It would be better to appropriately increase the purchase price to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>The above are just a few points that address the crux of today's grain rationing and offer solutions. In today's turbulent times for the food supply in Shanghai, it is hoped that everyone can work together to overcome the difficulties. Originally, there are bound to be many obstacles and difficulties at the beginning of any work. This should not be used as a reason for negativity, but rather to overcome difficulties with courage and reach a smooth path. The work of grain rationing has a great impact on the stability of the rear of Greater East Asia. It is especially hoped that China and Japan can cooperate sincerely to achieve success.</p>

<p>As the end of the 32nd year is approaching, all banks and money houses have begun to handle their year-end closing of accounts. The commercial and savings departments have completed interest settlements one after another. During this closing period, all lending, whether mortgage, credit, or overdraft, will be temporarily suspended as usual. Overdrafts without prior contract stipulations must be completely cleared before the closing period. Therefore, the money market is currently tight due to the closing of accounts, but this is a normal phenomenon during the closing period. However, the overall financial situation remains stable due to the efforts of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank and Money House Reserve Fund in adjusting short-term lending and interbank lending. The internal reserves of the banks and money houses are exceptionally abundant. They are able to cope with all situations with ease and are determined to get through the year safely. It is predicted that the business operations of this year will be able to obtain considerable surpluses. Regarding the various industrial and commercial sectors, due to the soaring prices, business operations have developed considerably. There is no question that they will be able to safely pass the Lunar New Year. Markets in various industries, such as securities, will be closed for trading starting from the 28th to handle the closing of accounts. Banks and money houses will be closed for four days starting from January 1st and will reopen for business on January 5th.</p>

<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai remained stable as usual last week. The official market prices of various commodities remained unchanged. As the end of the year approached, various banks and money houses followed the usual practice of handling the year-end settlement and temporarily suspended lending operations while urging the collection of debts, thus tightening the money supply. However, prices continued to rise last week, and unscrupulous merchants manipulated and disrupted market prices, causing public anxiety. In particular, the prices of rice and coal, both essential for people's livelihood, rose sharply. In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the municipal authorities are now thoroughly investigating the black market and suppressing underground market prices as a countermeasure, hoping that prices will soon fall. Moreover, the authorities are doing their best to dredge the sources to thoroughly resolve the issue and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Ten Thousand Miles of the Long March: A Certain Staff Officer's Experiences <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The war has already been going on for two years. The enemy, encircled, are before the flag of Japanese warships, where they have established the impregnable Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, the enemy has now begun an all-out, desperate counteroffensive. Faced with this, our billion citizens must deliver a final, thorough, and devastating blow. As the Great East Asia War enters its third year, a certain lieutenant colonel from the 〇〇 squadron, who participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the largest base of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, at the beginning of the war, and subsequently participated in all the battles to dominate the North and South Pacific and the Indian Ocean, traveling no less than ten thousand miles, recently returned to the 〇〇 base. The following is a discussion of "Impressions of Ten Thousand Miles of the Battle Line," to encourage the home front to strengthen its war effort.</p>
<p>Attack on Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>Our fleet, shouldering the ideal of national construction, embarked on a great expedition of four thousand miles. In the dawn of December, the order came down: "Prepare to depart." The sea was quite treacherous, but the Pearl Harbor area was generally clear. The commander of the air unit finally gave the first order of the Great East Asia War. 〇〇 planes enthusiastically flew towards Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>Those who saw them off devoutly prayed to the gods. For this day, our naval air corps had endured many years of hardship, and we believed that they would surely achieve a great victory. Indeed, at the scheduled time, the first telegram arrived: "Our surprise attack is successful."</p>
<p>Before the planes took off, we were listening to enemy intelligence in the ship via wireless. That day was Sunday, and the sounds of church prayers were being broadcast. They were conducting morning prayers: "May God grant assistance to the United States." At the moment when the naval aircraft, as predicted, attacked Pearl Harbor, the radio reported the chaotic state of the enemy, scattering in confusion.</p>
<p>"A certain unit of the army, hurry to the team!"</p>
<p>"Technicians, gather there!"</p>
<p>"See the unit assemble here, the entire division of Honolulu, quickly assemble in a certain area, under the command of a certain person."</p>
<p>The last sentence was invariably: "For the glorious homeland of the United States!" These final words—"For the glorious homeland of the United States"—made us deeply aware that, at the beginning of the war, the Americans also had patriotism. Although their beliefs differed from those of Japan, their spiritual strength could not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Returning from Hawaii, on the evening of the tenth, we heard the news that, thousands of miles away on the Malay Sea, our naval aircraft had sunk the British Far East Fleet's main force, the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>Phoenix soaring tens of thousands of miles,</p>
<p>Avenging the arrogant with a single divine shout,</p>
<p>Bombing and shattering Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>A touch of the sleeve, an invincible machine.</p>
<p>The fact that the enemy carried out this unprecedented large-scale attack in world war history was truly due to the late Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto. When departing to attack Hawaii, the commander encouraged us, saying: "Do not treat the enemy as a small enemy, but also do not fear them as a large enemy. Simply hold a belief in certain victory. Those who have a belief in certain victory, do not forget that there will surely be divine assistance."</p>
<p>We completely believed in the commander's path to certain victory and set out on our journey. When we learned of Marshal Yamamoto's heroic death while commanding in the air, we further strengthened the belief, as Marshal Yamamoto said, that the Imperial Navy always and everywhere inherits the "always on the battlefield" and "belief in certain victory," and thus will surely be victorious. When returning from Pearl Harbor, to report, in just one month, the commander's hair had turned completely white, and even his complexion had changed.</p>
<p>Sending us on the expedition to Hawaii,</p>
<p>His brow was filled with a belief in certain victory.</p>
<p>Returning from Hawaii to meet,</p>
<p>The general's head had turned white.</p>
<p>Establishing the Dutch East Indies Campaign</p>
<p>We attacked Java and Sumatra from the south. Enemy cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships, fleeing in defeat, were sunk one after another. A certain ship suddenly encountered an American cruiser at night. Our side clearly thought it was the enemy, but the enemy was completely unaware. The searchlight shone there, asking whether it was the enemy or friend, emitting a "Enemy? Friend?" firing signal. With such a good target, we immediately aimed and sank it. At that time, many people abandoned ship to escape in small boats from the defeated enemy ship. These boats were full of American, British, and Dutch officers. A certain small boat was captured, and when asked, they had been drifting for more than a week.</p>
<p>In the doldrums of the equator, the emotions of those drifting aimlessly… keenly felt the inevitability of defeat in war. At the same time, we, the victors, gratefully acknowledged the blessings of Heaven.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean Operations</p>
<p>Our 〇〇 unit turned its guns and advanced into the Indian Ocean. By this time, the war had been going on for five months, and the enemy had made considerable preparations. On the road ahead, as we advanced according to plan, we finally discovered enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>But at this time, it could also be said that there was divine assistance. The enemy's patrol was extremely clumsy. Although they flew towards us from the front, they did not know it until we took action. As soon as they came into contact with our actions, they fled, and our fighter planes pursued and shot them down one by one. When lowering to strafe, sentries and messengers were shot dead one by one. It was truly a pleasant and heroic battle.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean operation, we used attack to meet attack and inflicted great damage on the British. When bombing the enemy aircraft carrier Hermes, the Hermes was very close to the land, backed by large mountains, making it difficult to discover. Moreover, in that place, it was discovered and bombed by Japanese aircraft, because it was in a shallow area, there was no way to avoid it, only fate could help. In this operation, Lieutenant General Tamon Yamaguchi bestowed routine rewards, and his achievements at that time were truly great. His heroic figure standing on the bridge and commanding is still vivid in my mind.</p>
<p>Attack is the best defense. Attack is the first move in war, and only offense can lead to victory. Look at the current battles in the south. From a strategic point of view, it may be correct to think that Japan is taking a defensive posture. The south is now like pulling back a bow with an arrow nocked, waiting for the enemy to come, so it cannot be said to be a defensive posture. Even speaking of attack, unprepared attacks are meaningless. Engaging in strengthening the war effort as soon as possible is the task of the home front.</p>
<p>Northern Operations</p>
<p>The occupation of the Aleutians was on June 8th. We thought that the United States had also made considerable preparations, but Attu Island and other places were one-sided battles, occupied without bloodshed. At that time, the fog was extremely dense, and there was no clear sea lane, so navigation was indeed extremely difficult, and the landing point was unknown. In this state, we proceeded in the thick fog, using dead reckoning, in a place where nothing could be seen, twenty minutes ahead of the scheduled time. Eighteen minutes before, at a distance of about three thousand meters from the land, we suddenly saw the snowy mountain peaks on the opposite side.</p>
<p>In the dark and foggy night, was this not divine assistance? The gratitude at this moment, stepping on the completely white virgin snow that no one had ever trod on, and the red naval flag fluttering on the snowy mountain peak, will never be forgotten. The work of the gods, recognizing the snowy mountains in the fog. On the snow peak, a majestic flag stood.</p>
<p>After dawn, we saw the situation of the Aleut tribe of the Chichagof Harbor settlement living on Attu Island. When we approached, they fled quickly and nimbly. Later, we heard from their report that the Americans here had notified the mainland via radio that "Japanese soldiers have come." The Aleut tribe numbered about forty, with an American couple managing the politics and everything else here, and they used radio to communicate. The American residence was very luxurious, with considerable cold-proof equipment, heavy oil stoves, phonographs, etc., and was equipped with power generation equipment, so only their house had electric lights.</p>
<p>Compared to this, the existence of the Aleut tribe was truly pitiful. Here, one could also see the Americans' insatiable exploitation. On May 29th of this year, the entire Attu Island garrison was martyred. Kiska was evacuated at the end of July. Because of the evacuation operation of Kiska, we attacked the Aleutians again, which was truly deeply felt. Hearing about the martyrdom of the entire Attu Island garrison in the nearest place, we first firmly made a vow to take revenge. It was the Yamazaki unit transported by our warships. That unit no longer exists, completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The enemy, with a large army, forces the isolated island,</p>
<p>Mountains of corpses and rivers of blood stain the water red.</p>
<p>Soldiers and officers are martyred on the northern sea mountains,</p>
<p>Their loyalty and valor comparable to Masashige Kusunoki of old.</p>
<p>The evacuation of Kiska was an extremely difficult battle. For ten days, the dense fog did not dissipate, and several warships moved in the fog, unable to see each other. Radio communication was naturally impossible. However, there was also divine blessing here, combined with the skills of the soldiers. One of the divine blessings was the density of the fog, making it difficult for the enemy to discover us. The second was that, on a certain day, at the best moment, we saw the sun for an extremely short time, at which point each ship was able to determine its position. The third was that, when approaching the island, we saw a protruding part of the island for about one minute. The captain did not let go of this opportunity, determining the direction in less than a minute. The fourth was that, two days before, the enemy had killed each other and was not in this area.</p>
<p>Finally, we approached the bay. At this time, we saw the entrance to the bay at a distance of about five hundred meters. And the final divine blessing was that, after entering the bay, the bay was inexplicably very clear. The boarding of the evacuation unit was extremely rapid, completed in only half the scheduled time. After the entire force boarded and left the port, it was all dense fog outside. We returned safely in this dense fog. The joy of the evacuation unit, the joy of the welcoming unit, that was truly beyond words. (Xiang: Translated from the December 7th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Warm Current <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Xin</p>
<p>—— Opening the pen, I face the cold and lonely people, face your letters, face the sounds of begging outside the window, I want to create a crimson smile within an ice flower.</p>
<p>Don't say it, maybe you understand, I hope it is like the crimson of plum blossoms on branches, or like the cheeks of children when ice skating; if this can bring you a pleasant flush like when you are tipsy, then one can exaggerate and say: I even hope this is the "warm current" in your heart.</p>
<p>For a long time, you have been ill; this strange and barren illness; you say you once tried to commit suicide three times. But in the end, the love of life overcame you; you are alive.</p>
<p>My heart was taken aback! Cowardly you, why couldn't three suicides take your life? Stubborn you, struggling against the temptation of death, once! Twice! Three times!</p>
<p>Some people praise death, comparing death to a girl in blue, so gentle, so quiet. Imagine a legend in a poem: at sunset, when the evening breeze is warm and clear, an old missionary in his eighties, watching the sunset's glow, a golden depth; the constant, fine, and broken sound of the waves carries his faraway gaze, satisfied wishes, and a low song: "God dwells with me..."</p>
<p>He quietly fell asleep, a long and eternal sleep.</p>
<p>Some people passionately love death, comparing death to the fiery kapok of the south; the bright red flowers, in the midst of raging storms, cannot stand on the highest branches, like the red cape and red blood of a bullfighter, dying in ferocity. They say that dying in golden armor under the iron hooves of horses is heroic.</p>
<p>—— Yes, I also love that kind of death. If it is death in one's own will, and for freedom, for glory, for a more tenacious life!</p>
<p>Rather than dying like Napoleon on a desolate island, would you not prefer to die like Alexander the Great on a powerful, joyous wedding night? Rather than dying like Maupassant in a desolate mental asylum, would you not rather die like Spencer on the vast and long road of pursuit? But your letter says that your suicide was only for weariness, and the second and third times were still weariness! The loneliness of the time made you feel even more the past heroism and passion. You said: You asked life: Why are you living? The past of emotions proudly told you; the past of childhood told you with maternal love; the past of profession told you with the sacred light of education!......</p>
<p>But you are sick, all hopes and loves have become elusive emptiness. You want to take your life with your own hands! Darkness is like an overturned pool of tears, stealing the shimmering green of your youth: your kind mother trembles in the poverty of the ruined old neighborhood, illness erodes her kind and comforting words, and finally stifles the winter sun for you! —— Becoming a child without a mother. Your proud friends have gone away, taking away the loving voice and the strong support that you loved to hear most.</p>
<p>You are sick and dreaming, dreaming of the cold of your dead mother, dreaming of your drifting brother in despair. In the empty and lonely room, you say you can't wait to dream of being with them forever. You are willing to deeply believe in the Buddhist stories of emptiness and the soul. In the small room, you murmur, questioning time, but what answers you are only the sounds of bamboo leaves under the thin twilight that passes by. So you think of the meaning of life outside the hospital; like an accountant meticulously going through line after line of accounts, you also want to calculate the accounts of people's lives!</p>
<p>Yes, because you feel the gray coldness of this world; how many people drift about aimlessly, how many people quietly and silently disappear; it is as if people are going to the execution ground of "death" like prisoners in a prison van. But the executioners are not all living to their natural old age! But in the end, you can't envy those with full bellies and bloated fat, who are happy...</p>
<p>We all understand the pain of hunger, but what can we say? Aren't there many who are even less worthy of living than us! We are chewing on loneliness. War has destroyed everything and also made everything, and what is painful is only lingering and decline; not only on the earth but also in life. You must pursue your life, be the king, the master, the victor who endures the bitter door; but never commit suicide.</p>
<p>Look, isn't someone begging outside again? The life of the beggar is in the trembling voice, the sound of that life trembling all the way to stiffness; he rests only after creating the unequal sadness in this world.</p>
<p>We are pitiful and small pursuers in this world, whether in spiritual or material poverty, what does it matter if we dream? But it must be a dream of pursuit, always a successful and joyful one. Saneatsu Mushanokōji once said in Mother and Child: —— Travelers travel the road, until death they do not stop!</p>
<p>I know you won't strangle yourself, and you don't even have the money to buy a "Lysol" by your bedside. If you do, you might as well share a little with the beggar, teaching you to see the tenacity of life at that time!</p>
<p>Tighten your belt, face the cold, poverty, loneliness, and neglect, and die in a distant view of hope. In the meantime, fear the old general who will excavate all the filth, ignorance, childishness, and greedy desires of humanity in the world.</p>
<p>Then you will get the joy of the pride of old age in victory! Isn't it?</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Fate of Books <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>When a child is sick, they need to see a doctor, which is natural, especially a child who is only a few months old! How can they withstand the torture of illness? But seeing a doctor is not easy in this day and age. The high pressure of daily life is already suffocating. Where can one find the money to see a doctor? Without seeing a doctor, one can only resign oneself to fate.</p>
<p>One day, two days passed, but the child's condition did not improve. It seemed necessary to call a doctor. To call a doctor, the first thing to solve was the money problem. Borrow? From where? Pawn? What items? There was no way. One could only search within the house, but the only things that could be found that could be exchanged for some money were some books that "cannot be eaten when hungry and cannot be worn when cold."</p>
<p>After careful consideration, I finally decided on the fate of my few and only spiritual friends—books. I took them and headed towards a used bookstore that I often frequented. On the road, for some reason, my heart began to feel heavy. I felt an indescribable pain that made me unable to bear to look at them again. How could I be willing to abandon the friends who had shared my sorrows and joys for so many years? I had been comforted by them, and I had not forgotten them for a moment, but why was I doing this unjust thing? No! I can't do it. Let's go back! But as soon as I turned my head, the sight of the child groaning in bed seemed to be displayed on a screen before my eyes. Under the assault of this double-layered thought, my body unknowingly approached the used bookstore.</p>
<p>"Hey! Do you want to buy these books?"</p>
<p>"What? Mr. Lin, are you kidding?" the bookseller said, as if in disbelief, because I had always only bought from him, but had never sold to him, so he thought I was there to joke with him; but I was wronged, how could the old owner know my mood at this time? How could I have the leisurely mood to joke with him? I wish I could show him my heart at this moment.</p>
<p>"Really, I'm not kidding with you. Take a look, how much are they worth?" As I said this, I handed him the books. Only then did he believe that I was really there to sell them to him. He took the books and flipped through them one by one, scrutinizing them. After looking them over once, he said to me, "Mr. Lin! I like to be straightforward, and besides, we are old customers, so I don't want to make you suffer. In reality, at this time, people don't have money to buy this kind of leisure book to read, but since you've come, I can't say no. I'll just give you fifteen yuan for them. How about it?" When I heard this, I was extremely angry. I took back the books and, without a word, ran away at once. My heart began to become even more chaotic. I thought that selling these books as waste paper might be worth more than that amount of money. Therefore, I cursed the black-hearted old owner for not treating other people's things as things at all. But I also regretted that I shouldn't have done this kind of thing, to invite unnecessary insults.</p>
<p>Harboring a belly full of resentment, I blindly wandered east and west. Later, I sold them at another bookstore. When I saw him giving me the money, my nerves began to feel numb. What else could this be but my friends' final farewell letter? I stood there dumbfounded, alas! My friends! We are parting forever! I have doomed you in my ruthless palm, but whose fault is it? The pressures of the environment force me to do this kind of thing. Friends, you must understand my predicament, I ask you to forgive me, goodbye, friends! In bleak silence, I left the used bookstore with a depressed heart. (Sponsored by Yishou Scholarship)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Discussion of the Lineup for the International Cup Football Tournament: Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan is More Experienced; There is Ample Talent in the Center Defense; the Forward Line Should be Strengthened <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The registration for this year's International Cup Football Tournament has already closed. The participants include teams from China, Russia, Portugal, and Northern Europe. Now, the Yilians team has reorganized and requested to participate. After discussion by the committee, considering that the order has not yet been finalized, permission was granted to accept them, thus increasing the competition to five countries. The competition order has also been arranged by the authorities.</p>
<p>Grand Tournament</p>
<p>The grand tournament is scheduled to begin in mid-January. At that time, this important competition, which has international significance, will cause a sensation in the football world, and the grand occasion is bound to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>Our Chinese team naturally attaches great importance to this competition. Therefore, the authorities have organized a selection committee to carefully consider the selection of players. Eighteen outstanding athletes have been selected as representatives of the Chinese team. There are nine players from the Donghua team: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Tan Fuzhen, Han Longhai, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, and Li Wei. There are also nine players from the Lianyi team: Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Song Lingsheng, Qu Yongfu, Zheng Yingquan, Xu Wenkui, Li Yichen, and Fei Chunhua. With the insightful views of the committee members, such a selection should not be questioned. Moreover, the regret of overlooked talent is inevitable. According to Football Association journalist Zhou Junyu, there may be a possibility of supplementing the selection with one or two more players later. However, it is difficult for all eighteen or nineteen players to have an opportunity to play in the competition. Although it is to prepare for all eventualities, it has a sense of being excessive. In short, this is an international competition, and I deeply hope that the authorities will be especially careful in deploying the lineup, and even more sincerely hope that each representative will abandon prejudices, wholeheartedly exert themselves, and strive to win glory for the country!</p>
<p>Lineup</p>
<p>It is understood that the deployment of the lineup is roughly as follows, and a trial match is also planned at Yiyuan this afternoon to test it.</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Li Ning Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu Tan Fuzhen Song Lingsheng</p>
<p>Li Wei Sun Jinshun Dai Linjing Xu Wenkui Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>As for the goalkeeper position, Liu is more experienced than Zhang Banglun, so Zhang should be replaced with Liu. As for defender Li Ning, he has revived his youth this year. Apart from being a bit slower, he has regained his style of the past, so there should be no problems. As for the right-back position, according to each match's performance, Wu Qixiang has stood alone, being fierce and extraordinary, so there is no one else who can replace him. It is vaguely heard that Wu may be tied down by family affairs. If so, then I think Zhang Linggen could be supplemented to fill this vacancy, because Zhuang Youren and Li Tiansheng do have the demeanor of old generals, but they have both been in decline lately, so they are not as strong as Zhang Linggen's bold and decisive style, which can be competent. What do you think? There are abundant talents in the center defense line. Han Longhai, Zheng Yingquan, and Qu Yongfu each have their own characteristics, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Replacing this one or replacing that one does not pose a major problem. As for the forward line, the discussion is about the right inside forward and left winger. Looking at Xu Wenkui's recent situation, his strength has not been seen to be sufficient, and his footwork is also deficient. Xu's strength is indeed insufficient, while Li does not seem to be lacking in laziness, and has also been away from this position for a long time, appearing very stiff, so I hope that Xu can take care of himself more, and Li can practice a few more times. Then both Li and Xu are materials worthy of the above praise, and both can exert their power. It is also not a good strategy to fail to take advantage of both. Then there is no choice. In my opinion, only Li Wei is competent, without hesitation. Fortunately, Li and old Sun have a path of communication, or they may have a surprising performance. In short, Li is a material who knows how to improve, and he progresses more and regresses less in each game, so he should be entrusted with heavy responsibilities!</p>
<h3 id="e44">Trial Match with the Yilians Team Today <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>This afternoon at 3:30, a trial match will be held at Yiyuan against the Yilians team. The style of the Yilians army is deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary fans, especially the excellence of their goalkeeper, which is amazing. Although they have been absent from the field for a long time, they have recently practiced hard to restore their former heroic posture. Their lineup is roughly the same as before. The new center forward has never shown his face in Shanghai before, and is naturally capable of good reviews, so today's game is a trial before the official competition for both sides, and neither side will dare to relax a step, striving to exert their best skills to the fullest, which is truly a treat for the fans.

<p>Under the leadership of Zhao Zhuguang, the Shanghai Physical Training Institute has cultivated many talents over the years. Recently, to enhance students' self-defense skills, in addition to the existing Western boxing class, a wrestling class has been specially organized, with the famous wrestling master Mr. Tong Zhongyi personally teaching. The students of the institute are enthusiastically participating, and people from all walks of life are welcome to join. Furthermore, the third issue of the first volume of the institute's "Jian Li Mei" (Strength and Beauty) magazine has been published. It includes Ding Fubao's "Family and Mold," Lin Yongshang's "Secrets of Qigong Training," and various methods for strengthening the body, with extremely rich content.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Sights and Sounds from the Sports Field <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The teams participating in the Mayor's Cup this time include the seven strongest teams in Group A: Donghua, Lianyi, Portuguese Business, Jewish, Police #1, Three Provinces, and Overseas Chinese Federation, all of whom are out in full force. The remaining teams are the strong teams in Group B: Huatong, Russian Police, Soviet, Hequn, and Soviet Shell six teams, and Nie Zhongcheng and Youlian from Group C. The relative strengths of these teams can be seen at a glance. The future competition will often be among a few teams from Group A. The Portuguese Business and Overseas Chinese Federation have refreshed their lineups, posing a serious threat to Donghua and Lianyi.</p>
<p>Nie Zhongcheng lost to Portuguese Business by eleven goals. People said that losing by less than a dozen goals wasn't much. However, the team's goalkeeper performed well. Although he conceded eleven goals, he saved more than two dozen shots.</p>
<p>Tan Yongzhan, the forward of the Huaying basketball Group B team, is a former Fudan volleyball star who attended the Far Eastern Games. His basketball style also has the style of playing volleyball: quick release and unmatched speed.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiapei, a female basketball and volleyball star, married Mr. Xu. She already has a child this year. Last week, she also appeared at Xiqing, completely in the style of a young mistress, without the heroic spirit of her days on the court.</p>
<p>It is said that Wu Qixiang may have difficulty attending recent games due to family affairs, which would be a small loss for the Chinese team.</p>
<p>Zhongbei withdrew from Xiqing and joined Zhongqing, determined to win. However, with Li Zhenzhong's foot injury still not recovered, it may be difficult to achieve their wish.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingquan, a famous player from the Hong Kong-based Lianyi team, is following in the footsteps of Song Lingsheng with the news of his formal engagement, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Li Yao smokes very heavily, his fingers are very yellow. The reporter hopes he can smoke less!</p>
<p>Liu Hesheng's baldness is more pronounced, and his voice is even louder when he referees on the field, which shows a glimpse of his state of mind.</p>
<p>Miss Yu, who must be present at every Xiqing game, always brings knitting and works while watching, which attracts much attention. (Our reporter)</p>

<p>— By Tom, translated from German</p>
<p>Twenty-six. Muscles of the Forearm</p>
<p>Exercise 1</p>
<p>To develop the muscles of the forearm, there are two special movements.</p>
<p>With both arms at your side, clench your fists tightly, then quickly release and extend your fingers as much as possible. Continue to open and close your hands quickly and forcefully, keeping your arms as still as possible.</p>
<p>Close and open the hands of the forearm (ten times each). Note: For individual special practice, open and close the hands 25 to 50 times each.</p>
<p>Exercise 2</p>
<p>Extend both arms horizontally to the left and right, clench your fists, palms down. Forcefully lower, bend, and rotate your hands, then raise them as high as possible. This up-and-down movement should only occur at the wrist joint, keeping the arms still.</p>
<p>Note: Although this exercise can be done without equipment, it is best to hold a light object in your hands, such as a dumbbell. If you don't use dumbbells, the Warman Grip Exerciser is the best choice, costing only a few cents per pair. All kinds of exercises that use dumbbells can be replaced with this.</p>
<p>Forearm horizontally extended left and right; down, up (ten times each).</p>
<p>Note: Stretch the muscles as much as possible. After ten times down and ten times up, you will feel the muscles of your forearm engorged with blood. Special practice should not be less than twenty-five times.</p>
