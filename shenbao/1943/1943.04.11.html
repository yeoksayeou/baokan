<p>社評</p>
<h3>切不可「縱了大魚」</h3>
<p>自從政府發表了「澈查上海大規模投機囤積」的命令以後，我們深信全上海四百餘萬的市民，除了自己做投機囤積的少數人惴惴惶恐之外，每個人的視綫，都集中在這一問題上面，翹首以望，有一個明快嚴正的結果。因爲這一個肥了少數苦了大衆的「投機囤積」，所造成物價高漲的罪惡，實在累得小民們幾年來喘不過氣來，現在居然獲得政府當局的注意，而下令徹查，焉得不令人興奮而欣喜呢？</p>
<p>不過，愈是期望殷切，愈是臧慮叢脞，道也許是人情之常。我們再一回想古今歷史上的「澈查大案」，其結果能够破除情面的例子，總比徇情枉法的爲少。想到道裏，我們就唯恐這次的澈查，萬一誤用了寬仁德性，而大車化小事，無聲無臭的結束，或是縱了大魚，捉了小魚的敷衍了事。雖則答案還未褐曉，近乎過分的悲觀，大可小必，但願這種臧慮成爲「杞人臧天」，那眞正是大幸了。</p>
<p>我們再看國府令文中，已經明言：「查得上海有大規模投機囤積」，這個「大規模」，就是壓迫我們大衆生活最緊的大魚，明明「查得」這些大魚在上海的池壙領域裏，不過因爲魚大力大，游潛銳利，非普通的捕魚技術和脆薄魚網所能張羅。如果一旦入網了，也因爲牠的彈滑力大，容易有意無意地漏網了。所以目前澈查的問題，最主要的爲是否「縱了大魚」。對此，我們的管見：</p>
<p>（一）「擒賊須擒王」，這是自古戰爭中制勝的要着。所以，捉了小魚，而縱了大魚，其結果成效，定等於零。</p>
<p>（二）某種物資，因戰後來源斷絕，或因交通運輸阻滯，法令限制而來源减少，這種物資，如果更被大囤積者悉數收買囤藏，操縱市上的供求量失平，於是黑市日高　這種大魚，爲害最烈，如予寬縱，則整個市塲仍在混亂之中。</p>
<p>（三）小魚雖亦可惡，但常隨大魚爲尾閭，大魚被捕，小魚自然斂跡。縱有餘勇，亦不能鼓起波浪。而且大魚已去，小魚失其憑藉，更不難一網打盡。</p>
<p>所可欣幸者，這次一有賦予堅靱的魚網，二有擔任捕魚諸公的高明技術，相信一定能够捕獲大魚，更不致「縱了大魚」的。</p>
<p>此外，我們於痛受敎訓之餘，對於今後防止囤積的方法，亦願提出數點，供當局的參考：</p>
<p>（一）請政府明定取締囤積的處罰法令。</p>
<p>（二）商店須專業化，加入各業公會，並不得購存本業以外之貨品。批發商對於零賣商批貨時，須查騐其公會證害。已經購存貨品，應即出售。非商人一律不准大量購貨。</p>
<p>（三）過去民間尚未登記之貨品，再限期一星期或十日，給予登記之機會，由政府規定一公道價格，作爲「限價」之標準數。</p>
<p>（四）凡查出與政府有關人員之囤貨，應全數沒收，作爲政府實施限價之基本貨物。</p>
<p>這裏不過約略列舉數點，具體的，周密的辦法，尚有待大家提出討論。</p>
<h3>祝上海市民福利協會成立</h3>
<p>上海是一個四百餘萬人口的大都市，一向成爲中國經濟上，文化上，以至政治上的重心。如果上海市民希望對於切身問題有發表意見的機會，就必須有一個自治的組織，以資推動。</p>
<p>本報爲此，曾於去年十二月十二日的社評「上海需要一純粹的人民團體」中會建言：（一）集合各方面的公正人士和各界的專家，作這個民問組織的領導者；（二）參加份子，必須在上海具有殷實事業，或正當職業的公正人士，爲上海數百萬市民的公共利益而服務；（三）應以解決全市民一切切身問題謀求全市民自己的幸福爲該組織最高目標；（四）協助當局推行各種有利市民的政策；（五）溝通中日兩國人民的意見，力避雙方一切誤會。</p>
<p>目前，本市各界的有力者，亦感覺此時此地確應有一個組織的必要，經過一個多月的努力，組成一個「上海市民福利協會」，已於昨天召開成立大會。這在市民福利的前途着想，實在値得慶幸的。</p>
<p>我們檢閱該會的宗旨，是（一）力求市民之福利；（二）宜達市民正當之意旨：（三）協助當局推行良好政策三點，陳義不高，愈平凡則愈眞誠，我們盼望該會能脚踏實地，把握這三點做去，相信其成效不但使市民稱利，而對於當局與民間的情感，定必有融洽的溝通。</p>
<p>我們再看該會的信條：（一）凡不屬於市民福利範圍者，不加討論；（二）凡屬於市民福利範圍而無須運用團體力量者，不加研討；（三）凡經本會討論成立之市民福利事項，不論消極積極，應用建議方式，以與有關方面接洽。從這裏充分說明該會的態度，惟以市民顯利爲惟一目標。</p>
<p>民間團體，易於組織，而難於守成，尤其是行動與宣言表裏一致，不爲少數人把持利用，更屬難能可貴。我們於上海市民福利協會之成立，願以「實事求是，言行一致。」八字謹獻，並祝該會將來之業績，有極大的收穫。</p>

<h3>馬來·蘇門答臘軍政設施</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭下，由於日軍勇猛果敢的虞鬥，接連佔領敵地，其作戰的一部，也就跟着移行於軍政，而採取完遂戰爭的結集手段。作戰的企圖，爲達成直接的戰爭目的之方策，而軍政，則爲使這個直接目的得以完遂之强力的協助手段。所以軍政以恢復佔領地的治安，急速獲得重要物資，並强化作戰的當地自養，爲其主要任務，而由軍部自己負責行之。軍政的任務如能完全遂行，作戰區域方有强力的前進，生產戰方能確保，而且以資培養戰力的長期決戰態勢，方能臻於完善。故軍政機構的是非所繫，於日本的完全勝利，關係很大。</p>
<p>馬來方面最高指揮官山下奉文將軍，在作戰開始之前，早已切感着這次戰爭形態的特異性，爰即樹立廣大而周密的作戰計劃，並在其表裏一體的關係上，密命一部分幕僚，策畫周密的軍政方案，俾於佔領馬來後，立即依此方案，施行軍政，以便遂行作戰企圖。一面達成軍政自的，又可極力援助其他作戰。這實是英明的將軍和其幕僚部的卓見。因爲日軍有着那樣周到的準備，所以背後的不安，悉被除去，使敵誤認日方的兵力，信爲有數倍的日軍襲來，遂使其不得不出於投降一途。因此在馬來半島上，勢如南下的怒濤般的進擊之後，不久就成立了莊嚴的軍政支部，英國統治的行政機能，就那樣地完全爲日方接收，行政便以新的姿態而產生出來了，故在新加坡陷落之前，馬來半島一已完全施行着日方的軍政。不過在新加坡陷落之後，馬來軍政的基本方針，是成於緬甸的戡定，蘇門答臘和爪哇的佔領，尚未完竟之間的，亦即是日本的最初嘗試，故曾一再推敲，以期愼重。在太平（Thipeng）成立的馬來軍政要綱，實爲傾其心血而作成的，軍政幕僚在新加坡陷落之前一個月，曾把這個方案携往大本營，更就具體的事項，作過審愼的商討。所以它就成爲大東亞戰爭後軍政要綱的基本方案，成爲軍政組織的一個型式。在這個意味上，馬來的軍政，實是頗饒興味的。</p>
<p>馬來軍政的樣式，和菲島及緬甸那樣把原住民所組成的行政府在日方指揮之下運用者不同，係採用一任日軍自己行政的方式，這是不待說得的。馬來軍政的特色，乃是對於未佔領地預先樹立確固的方針，而關於行政組織的運用，也準備好詳細的具體方案，一俟佔領後，立即付諸實施。因此關於昭南特別市的組織，首腦者的人選，撤消各支部而設置州，及於州內設置適當的指導者等，早於新加坡陷落之前，在日本國內各方面，銓衡有才幹而能稱職者，以備任用。又人選決定時，即命赴任，使負急速恢復當地治安之責，此種在硝烟彈雨之中的迅速的措置，實在使人注目。</p>
<p>蘇門答臘的軍政，和馬來稍異，去年二月十五日，日軍抵達巨港後，僅經一月稍餘，全蘇門答臘的戡定作戰，即告終畢，軍政即在馬來軍政部旗下，開始施行。其軍政雖準用馬來軍政，然與當地的情勢相應而行。不過馬來和蘇門答臘的軍政，並非沿着一年前的軍政無所變更而施行迄今的。一到大東亞戰爭進入決戰階段，自然就須預想到敵人的反攻，因此軍政也就擔負起防衛佔領地的重大任務。尤其是蘇門答臘，自安達曼羣島而臨印度洋，面對着敵人的反攻企圖，其重要性更比馬來爲大。又因蘇門答臘富於資源，從來有「握蘇門答臘者，可當百年戰爭」之稱、故蘇門答臘的軍政，除軍政的一般目的外，尚有防衛和資源開發二大目的，其所負任務，實較馬來爲重大。而且蘇門答臘以世界的寳庫聞名，其今後所需相當的努力，比諸已經探查過　馬來，自屬遠爲巨大。故蘇門答臘的軍政，雖與馬來軍政受同一監部掌管，共性格則不同，而在現階段，防衛和資源之徹底的開發，蘇門答臘正被要求着。記者鑒於馬來　蘇門答臘的重要性，特在這裏就馬來和蘇門答臘的軍政狀况，作一報告於下。</p>
<p>民族問題和治安</p>
<p>民族問顯是統治的重要問題，日軍在前回的軍政基本方策中，亦曾明白述及它的指導要領。不用說，唯有當地居民的由衷協力，方能期待軍政施策的完全。是當然的事，然而那必是須順應常地各別的特異性，向施行各種的統治樣式的。就現在居住於馬來和蘇門答臘的人種來看，若要問馬來是否如其字面所示是馬來人的馬來，則不如就其人口來回答，那是華僑的馬來。在戰前，馬來全人口五百四十萬中，華僑佔二百三十萬，（即四二·六％至如昭南島，則達七十五％），土著的馬來人，則不過二百二十五萬（四一·六％）。其次爲印度人，亦佔一三•八％。馬來從來爲許多人種雜居的半島，街上常有人種展覽會之觀。反之，在蘇門答臘的全人口八百五十萬中，華僑則祗有四十萬餘，除　他少數外，其餘七百八十萬餘，均爲馬來人。馬來人之中，雖亦分爲阿齊挨，明那加保，巴脫克等若干族，然大體是由單一民挨而成的。當荷蘭人統治蘇門答臘之初，對於阿齊挨族的統治不得其宜，遂對該族行使武力，弄得無法施行軍政，是因爲在行政上缺少了這二大注意之故。在這個意味上，對於土侯的處理，也非重視不可。即如蘇門答臘，其區分一族爲一州，使土侯參書地方行政，作爲民族指導者，除警察行政，物資配給等外，其他的地方行政，槪令負責，這種現狀，實在是調切的措置。當地居民，祇要使其言語，宗敎，風俗，習慣相同，則不加其他的力，自然會進向協助新秩序之一途的。</p>
<p>馬來和蘇門答臘的資源</p>
<p>馬來和蘇門答臘的資源，各有其特性。先就馬來說，如所周知，戰前以來，馬來以橡膠和錫，聞名於世。馬來出產的錫，佔世界　額的三〇％，主要之產地區大霹靂州，出產約百分之六十，其他如雪蘭莪，吉打，森美蘭等州，亦有出產。製鍊方面，無論採掘，提鍊，均在陸續開始，已有着預想以上的成績。至於橡膠，今後因昭南橡膠公司的成立，似將歸於荒廢的橡樹園，也陸續恢復起來了，現在只等待全　橡膠加了業的活動。馬來的二大實業，旣已這樣順利地恢復起來，故目前正殷待其充分貢獻於決戰之下。馬來資源中尚有不能等閑看過的，那就是飛機製造上所必要的資源。在要求着加緊開發資源的現時，馬來正在盡其一切，目前只待如何把它活　而已。</p>
<p>蘇門答臘是有着和馬來不同的資源的大島，其資源是否尚未開發，還水充分調查明白。自日軍抵達該島後，全世界聞名的巨港煤油，即爲日軍所有。在蘇門答臘北海岸向東西而走的一帶油脈，成爲巨港的油田地帶。東亞的盟主日本，現在代替英美的資本來支配這裏的大油田了。所有的設備，已爲日軍接收，正在加緊生產，俾有以貢獻於完全勝利。　膠和錫，在戰前都是凌駕馬來的，現在錫（班加比里頓）和橡膠（全島），均將和馬來匹敵了。</p>
<p>農產資源和當地自養</p>
<p>馬來和蘇門答臘的大宗農產，可說就祭橡膠，其橡產情形，已如上述，然而橡膠的用途，則有須加以相當研究的必要。又橡膠的當地加工精製，也殊有從速實施的必要。現在橡膠的一部已可轉變爲代由燃料（橡油）等用，目下更在繼續研究，不久將另有新的用途可以發現。蘇門答臘除橡膠外，尚有棕櫚油及其他南洋農產品出產。至於當地居民的主要食品米和鹽，則從來出產小足，須仰賴於泰國及緬甸等的輸入。這種情形，在決戰之下，當地是難於自養的，因此日軍當局正爲此而拚命努力，同時米的增產也已有可驚的成績了。關於米穀栽種的事也在從事改良，一年收割二次，三次的方法，正在加以檢討。在蘇門答臘，已確信明年可以達到自給自足的境地，在馬來，吉打州出產的米，亦有轉運到州外的，吉蘭丹州則本年有自給自足希望，森美蘭及麻六用等，則已定有三年計劃。軍政監部已設有糧食增產班，正謀由珍珠米（Tapioca），甘藷，玉蜀黍等的代用食品之栽培以補不足，俾建立自給態勞。</p>
<p>又叢林地帶的林產資源，調查結果，許多的資源上的價値，早已在預想之中。蘇門答腦從來除米一項外，是富於農產品的，如茶，纖維，黛莉斯（Derris）根（一種除蟲劑），金雞納，阿仙藥，蓖麻，松脂，咖啡，紅茶，烟草，蔬菜等，出產很多。林產資源如麻栗樹，鐵樹（iron-Wood）等，出產亦很豐富。</p>
<p>如上所述，當地日軍的自養目的，差不多快要達成了；不但如此，從來取着依存於各外國的所謂偏在形態之蘇門答臘的自養。也正以其着實的步伐，一步一步走近可以滿洲的狀態。（昭南一日電——丁：譯自四月二日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>譯論　各方對澈查囤積命令之反響</h3>
<p>本月七日在在主席名義下所頒布的澈查投機買賣的命令，乃是囤積居奇者的當頭棒喝，由此，安定上　海民生，和復興經濟的癥結，也得因以消除。同時足以制止金融機關主要職員或在政治上占有重要地位的人去做投機行爲。這一道命令，引起了租界經濟界，政界，輿論界的重大反響。在國民政府公佈此令之前的上海投機家，據聞極有地位的要員，常有巨額定期支票支付。聽說此項資金，業已查出運用於投機囤積方面的證據。六日的申報上，登載一條「請求政府下決心取締囤積」的社評，這條社評和從來華文報紙所載的請求取締囤積言論不同，其所指出的幾點，每一點都是痛切爽快，提出政治上的嚴重，陳明上海金融界中投機買賣規模之大，使讀者人人頷首，並且引起中國各界人士的關心。從四日到七日的中國各界動向，只要把上海常前嚴重的政治與經濟上現狀表明一下，就可以斷定。關於這點，綜合租界各界有識人士的意見，大體如次：</p>
<p>（一）在主席這次所下的命令，人們都額手稱慶歡迎。中國國民還記得在民國二十六年有過一條和這次同樣的命令，結果因爲孔祥熙等一派的勢力關係，政令不能貫澈，以致有名無實地烟消雲散，希望汪主席不再重蹈覆轍，同時，更相信他一定可以做到言必行的一步。</p>
<p>（二）假使政府今後僅僅彈壓小規模的投機集團，不立刻去檢舉，利用金融機關，政治勢力在做大規模投機的人，而有所躊躇的話，那末這次的明令，祗能肅淸民間的一部份，而辦不到爲創造廉潔政治的全面肅淸。</p>
<p>（三）各銀行的領袖與各企業公司，都和政治上勢力保持密切關係，藉作護身符，這是無可否認的事實。大投機的出現，就是從這種宗派的官商合作中產生出來的。所以官商分野，的確需要明定界限。</p>
<p>（四）調查的結果，需要公開於人民之前，這是安定民心上的得策，而且調查委員中應該多添幾位立塲公正的民間人士。</p>
<p>（五）總之，今後的重要問題，與其防止投機，母寗防止政治勢力被利用在投機的背後。唯有官商分離，才能根絕各種大小投機。</p>
<p>（六）日本方面轉換經濟政策後，正在推進新物資政策的途上，而上海的現狀如此，在中日協力上，實覺不勝遺憾，致使當局不得不下這種命令，藉以克服這種不良的現狀。這可謂是當前中日合作上的最大問題。（雲鵬：譯自四月十六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>Absolutely Do Not "Let the Big Fish Get Away"</h3>
<p>Since the government issued the order to "thoroughly investigate large-scale speculation and hoarding in Shanghai," we deeply believe that all four million-plus citizens of Shanghai, except for the few engaged in speculation and hoarding who are apprehensive and fearful, have focused their attention on this issue, eagerly anticipating a clear and decisive outcome. This is because the sin of price increases caused by "speculation and hoarding," which enriches a few and harms the masses, has truly left the common people gasping for breath for years. Now, to our delight, the government authorities have taken notice and ordered a thorough investigation, which cannot but excite and gladden people.</p>
<p>However, the greater the expectation, the greater the anxiety, which is perhaps human nature. When we recall "thorough investigations of major cases" in ancient and modern history, there are fewer examples of breaking through personal relationships than of bending the law for personal gain. Thinking along these lines, we fear that this investigation, in the unlikely event that it is conducted with excessive leniency and ends with a major issue being reduced to a minor one, concluding silently and insignificantly, or that it is perfunctory, letting the big fish get away while catching the small ones. Although the answer is not yet clear, and this may seem overly pessimistic, it is better to be safe than sorry. We only hope that these anxieties become "杞人忧天" (groundless fears), which would be truly fortunate.</p>
<p>Looking again at the National Government's order, it clearly states, "It has been found that there is large-scale speculation and hoarding in Shanghai." This "large-scale" refers to the big fish that most tightly oppress the lives of our masses. It is clear that these big fish are in the pool of Shanghai, but because they are strong and skilled at swimming and diving, ordinary fishing techniques and flimsy nets cannot catch them. If they are caught in the net, they are likely to slip out intentionally or unintentionally due to their great elasticity. Therefore, the most important issue in the current investigation is whether or not "the big fish will get away." On this, our humble opinion is:</p>
<p>(1) "To catch bandits, one must catch the leader," which is a key to victory in war since ancient times. Therefore, catching the small fish and letting the big fish get away will result in zero effectiveness.</p>
<p>(2) If the source of certain materials is cut off due to the war, or if the source is reduced due to transportation obstacles or legal restrictions, and if these materials are then bought and hoarded by large-scale hoarders, manipulating the supply and demand in the market, then the black market prices will rise day by day. These big fish are the most harmful. If they are given leniency, the entire market will remain in chaos.</p>
<p>(3) Although small fish are also hateful, they often follow the big fish as their source. Once the big fish are caught, the small fish will naturally disappear. Even if they have remaining courage, they will not be able to stir up waves. Moreover, with the big fish gone, the small fish lose their backing, making it even easier to catch them all in one net.</p>
<p>What is gratifying is that this time we have a resilient net and the competent skills of the officials in charge of fishing. We believe that we will definitely be able to catch the big fish and, even more so, will not "let the big fish get away."</p>
<p>In addition, after painfully learning our lesson, we would also like to offer a few suggestions for preventing hoarding in the future for the authorities' reference:</p>
<p>(1) Please have the government clearly stipulate the penalties for cracking down on hoarding.</p>
<p>(2) Stores must specialize, join industry associations, and not purchase or store goods outside of their own industry. When wholesalers sell goods to retailers, they must verify their association certificates. Goods already purchased and stored should be sold immediately. Non-merchants are not allowed to purchase large quantities of goods.</p>
<p>(3) Goods not yet registered by the public in the past should be given another opportunity to register within a week or ten days, and the government should set a fair price as the standard number for the "price limit."</p>
<p>(4) If hoarding by government-related personnel is found, all goods should be confiscated and used as the basic goods for the government to implement price limits.</p>
<p>These are just a few points listed roughly. Specific and comprehensive methods still need to be discussed by everyone.</p>
<h3>Congratulating the Establishment of the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a metropolis with a population of over four million, and has always been the economic, cultural, and even political center of China. If the citizens of Shanghai hope to have the opportunity to express their opinions on issues that directly affect them, there must be an autonomous organization to promote this.</p>
<p>For this reason, this newspaper once suggested in the editorial "Shanghai Needs a Purely People's Organization" on December 12th of last year: (1) To gather impartial people from all aspects and experts from all fields to be the leaders of this civil organization; (2) Participants must be fair people with solid businesses or legitimate occupations in Shanghai, serving the public interests of millions of citizens of Shanghai; (3) The highest goal of the organization should be to solve all the pressing problems of all citizens and seek the happiness of all citizens; (4) To assist the authorities in promoting various policies that benefit the citizens; (5) To communicate the opinions of the people of China and Japan, and to avoid all misunderstandings between the two sides.</p>
<p>Currently, powerful people from all walks of life in this city also feel the necessity of an organization at this time and place. After more than a month of effort, the "Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association" was formed, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday. This is truly gratifying for the future of citizen welfare.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the association's objectives, which are (1) to strive for the welfare of citizens; (2) to convey the legitimate will of citizens; (3) to assist the authorities in implementing good policies. The propositions are not lofty; the more ordinary, the more sincere. We hope that the association can be down-to-earth and grasp these three points to carry them out. We believe that its effectiveness will not only benefit the citizens, but also provide a harmonious communication between the authorities and the people.</p>
<p>Looking again at the association's articles of faith: (1) Matters not within the scope of citizen welfare will not be discussed; (2) Matters within the scope of citizen welfare that do not require the use of group power will not be studied; (3) Citizen welfare matters that have been discussed and established by this association, whether passive or active, should be contacted with relevant parties in the form of suggestions. This fully illustrates the association's attitude, with the sole goal of benefiting citizens.</p>
<p>Civil organizations are easy to organize but difficult to maintain, especially to ensure that actions and declarations are consistent and not controlled or exploited by a few. We would like to offer the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association the eight words "Seek Truth from Facts, Consistency Between Words and Deeds" as a sincere gift, and wish the association great success in its future endeavors.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Special Envoy to Manchukuo: Zhou Fohai Was Received by the Manchu Emperor Yesterday; The Manchu Emperor Gave a Banquet in Jialou Palace, Showing Utmost Courtesy; After the Banquet, He Visited Premier Zhang to Discuss the Issue of Cooperative Warfare</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Special Envoy Zhou Fohai, accompanied by his entourage Yang Xinghua and others, led by the host, Mr. Yoshimura, departed from the guesthouse at 11:15 am in a car specially prepared by the Manchukuo Foreign Ministry to visit the Manchu Emperor. Amidst the cheers of citizens along the way, they arrived at the Imperial Palace at 11:30 am and briefly rested in the VIP room of the Qinmin Building. His Majesty the Manchu Emperor, wearing an army uniform and medals, accompanied by the Minister of the Inner Palace, Mr. Xi, and the Chief of Military Aides, Mr. Yoshimura, personally came to the East Palace at 11:40 am to receive them. Special Envoy Zhou accepted the handshake graciously bestowed by His Majesty the Manchu Emperor, and also received the entourage led by Yang Xinghua, expressing his condolences. His Majesty the Manchu Emperor held a banquet in the Jialou Palace to entertain Special Envoy Zhou and his party, accompanied by Premier Zhang, the Chief of General Affairs of the Military Department, Mr. Wu, the Minister of the Inner Palace, Mr. Xi, the host, Mr. Yoshimura, and about 40 other government officials. During the banquet, His Majesty the Manchu Emperor highly praised Mr. Zhou Fohai's assistance in the revitalization of China, with many words of encouragement. Special Envoy Zhou and his party deeply felt the Emperor's exceptional courtesy. After exiting the palace, they returned to the guesthouse.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Mr. Zhou Fohai, visited Premier Zhang of the State Council, the Chief of General Affairs of the Military Department, Mr. Wu, and the Vice-Minister of the General Affairs Office of the West Sea at 2:10 pm on the 10th, explaining China's determination to participate in the war and holding sincere discussions on strategies for China and Manchukuo to jointly complete the Greater East Asia War, which lasted for thirty minutes.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Special Envoy of the Republic of China to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, visited Minister Li of the Manchukuo Foreign Ministry at 2:40 pm on the 10th, mutually wishing for the advancement of diplomatic relations between China and Manchukuo. He returned to the guesthouse at 3:40 pm. Subsequently, Premier Zhang of the Manchukuo State Council, General Tanaka, the representative of the Kwantung Army Commander, and Minister Li of the Foreign Ministry visited the guesthouse in return. At 6:00 pm, he attended the banquet hosted by Premier Zhang at the Premier's residence, with friendly and harmonious exchanges.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - At the banquet hosted by Premier Zhang, the Special Envoy of the National Government to Manchukuo, Mr. Zhou Fohai, delivered a speech, the gist of which was that the diplomatic relations between China and Manchukuo began with the publication of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. On December 8th of the previous year, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries became even closer. On January 9th of this year, China's participation in the war further consolidated the third stage. Thus, China, Japan, and Manchukuo progressed from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. In order to adapt to this new stage, the National Government specially decided to send Special Envoy Chen to Japan and send me to Manchukuo, the purpose of which is to enhance friendly relations, needless to say, and to complete the Greater East Asia War through mutual unity. Although Manchukuo has only been established for ten years, each construction has made rapid progress. This visit to Manchukuo to observe the conditions of your country's capital can fully demonstrate the achievements of the great construction. I am extremely surprised. The National Government has only been back in the capital for three years, and there has been progress in all aspects. On the first anniversary of the return to the capital, the Basic Treaty between China, Japan, and Manchukuo was established, and the joint declaration of the three countries established the foundation for permanent peace between China and Japan and permanent friendship between China and Manchukuo. In the second stage, Germany and other friendly nations recognized our country, and because the National Government participated in the Anti-Comintern Pact, it became a link in the world axis from one of the axes of the Greater East Asia. By the third stage, it was able to declare war on Britain and the United States and cooperate with Japan. This is the significance of China sharing and completing the important responsibility of building a new order in East Asia and achieving world peace.</p>
<h3>Talking to Manchukuo Reporters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Xinjing, 10th - After arriving in Xinjing, our country's special envoy Zhou met with a group of Manchukuo reporters at the guesthouse at 6:20 pm on the 9th and answered questions from the reporters. The following is a record of the questions and answers. Question: What is the trend of the Chinese people after China's participation in the war? Answer: After our country participated in the war, the people were able to recognize the importance of the war and actively engaged in cooperation. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang stated that he would share weal and woe with Japan, but the people were not yet fully aware of it. The reason for this was nothing more than the existence of latent consciousness among the people, believing that the Greater East Asia War was Japan's war, not China's war. However, after our country's direct participation in the war, the consciousness of war surged among the people. The people have fully recognized that the Greater East Asia War is an automatic war, a war to automatically destroy Britain and the United States and strive for the final victory, and then actively came out to cooperate. Not only did they practice sharing weal and woe with Japan, but they also went on to share life and death with Japan. This tendency is especially evident in Shanghai's financial circles. Question: What is the status of wartime system construction in China after its participation in the war? Answer: China's wartime system, from a political point of view, has two aspects, namely the centralization of power and the simplification of institutions. China's highest policies are based on these two major principles and implemented. Currently, the Supreme National Defense Council makes the highest decisions and makes them concrete. As for the second point, in terms of the simplification of institutions, the central government has unified and merged the various departments within the Executive Yuan. On the local side, the committee system has been abolished and the provincial governor system has been adopted. Regarding this measure, on the one hand, it can be said to be based on the principle of the centralization of power, but its ultimate and greatest purpose is still to establish a unified administration and achieve great achievements. Moreover, from an economic point of view, the construction of this wartime system has previously published the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy, the goal of which is to ensure military supplies and stabilize people's livelihoods, and in order to achieve this goal, it is also considering strengthening production, economizing consumption, stabilizing finance, and adjusting economic institutions, which are currently being implemented one after another. Question: What impact has China's participation in the war had on the Chongqing side? Answer: Since the National Government officially announced its participation in the war, Japan immediately declared the return of the concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, which was a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. The purpose of the Chinese revolution, as indicated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, was to seek China's freedom and independence and abolish unequal treaties. This time, the friendly nation of Japan implemented the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and China's long-cherished wish can be said to have been realized because of this. The purpose of the Chinese revolution can also be said to have been achieved. Therefore, the Chongqing side has no way to appeal to the people for their resistance. Therefore, the National Government's official announcement of participation in the war was a fatal blow to the Chongqing side. Question: What will the National Government's future policy toward Chongqing be? Answer: Currently, the Chongqing side does not have any correct understanding of the construction of East Asia. Therefore, the National Government will use all means to awaken the Chongqing side, which is obsessed with its ways. However, during this period, we will naturally not relax our military, political, and economic suppression of Chongqing. At the same time, we will not forget to work hard to promote the awakening of Chongqing. Question: What is the division of war power between China and Manchukuo under the Greater East Asia War? Answer: There is no so-called division between the two countries. In short, the two countries each use their national strength and material resources to cooperate with the military actions of the friendly nation of Japan.</p>
<h3>Guilin Army Is Weary of War</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained here, the Chongqing army in Guangxi Province is experiencing a shortage of supplies due to the intensification of the Japanese army's sealing operations. Especially since the Japanese army's entry into Guangzhou Bay, they have had a severe shortage of food. In addition, insufficient supplies and difficulties in military supplies have led to widespread war-weariness within the Guangxi army. Deserting soldiers have flocked to become organized bandits, clashing with the Chongqing army from time to time. Recently, units of Zhang Fakui's troops who deserted and became bandits have gathered in the southern region of Nanning, divided into two units with great momentum, becoming a major threat within Guangxi Province. The Guangxi Provincial authorities have recently appointed the commander of the 131st Division as the commander of the Third Bandit Suppression Army, and will implement a large-scale suppression campaign.</p>
<h3>Li Xuantiao Appointed Vice Minister of the Army</h3>

<h3>Special Envoy to Japan, Chen Gongbo, Broadcasts to the Japanese People, Stating Strongly That the People of Both Countries Should Cooperate Closely, and Expressing China's Determination to Cooperate in the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Special Envoy of the National Government of the Republic of China to Japan, Chen Gongbo, delivered a broadcast speech to the Japanese people at the Central Broadcasting Station here at 7:00 pm on the 10th, stating strongly that China and Japan should cooperate closely and expressing China's determination to exert all its strength in both material and spiritual aspects to complete the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of sharing life and death. The original broadcast words are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Dear Japanese citizens, this time, after China and Japan participated in the Greater East Asia War, I was ordered to visit your country, and I am able to speak to you tonight. Not only do I feel honored, but I also feel infinitely happy. I came to your country in March of the 29th year of the Republic of China [1940] to return the courtesy. Now, three years have passed suddenly, and it has been three years since I parted with you. In the past, I also came with a mission of peace, but today I am here to implement cooperation. That is why I say that not only do I feel honored, but I also feel infinitely happy." I believe that you all feel the same way as I do. Now I still remember when I first broadcast to you on May 24th of the 29th year of the Republic of China [1940], I said, "This time I came to your country and saw your country's enthusiasm, which strengthened my personal belief even more. What is that belief? It is that "China and Japan can definitely have permanent peace, China and Japan can definitely cooperate sincerely, our future is bright, and we must jointly shoulder the great task of stabilizing East Asia. Now the world is undergoing dramatic changes, and the people of China and Japan should be more affectionate and cooperative, and prepare to jointly shoulder the great task of the future." The words I broadcast in Guangdong are all the common ideals, common aspirations, and common goals of the far-sighted people of China and Japan, and they are all sincere words. I think you all still remember them. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, after three years of struggle and effort, we have already realized the common ideals, common burdens, and common goals of China and Japan. Japan is preparing for the Greater East Asia War, and China is also preparing to follow Japan. Japan is launching the Greater East Asia War, and China is implementing following Japan. Chairman Wang issued a statement of sharing weal and woe in December of the year before last, and recently issued an oath of sharing life and death. This is enough to prove that China and Japan are not only cooperating sincerely, but also in perfect harmony. Now and in the future, although there is a distinction between countries in terms of region, there is no distinction between us and you in spirit. We, the people of China and Japan, are not only friends, but also brothers. After the National Government participated in the war this time, your country also declared the return of the exclusive concessions in the Republic of China, and recognized the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Peking Legation Quarter, and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, as well as other goodwill measures to vigorously support the construction of the new China. In the future, in order to adapt to the development of the new relationship between China and Japan, various existing agreements will also be considered in the same spirit. Moreover, on the anniversary of the third year of the National Government's return to the capital, your country first implemented the return of the exclusive concessions, and cooperated in the return of the Xiamen Public Concession and the Peking Legation Quarter. These resolute decisions and bold implementation have given the Chinese people a lot of excitement and gratitude. These excitements and gratitudes can never be contained by words, and can never be described by words. Today, I am here to express my gratitude to you, just a brief report, so that you can get a general idea. I solemnly tell you that China has the determination to share life and death, and at the same time has the physical and practical practice. We are preparing to contribute as much as possible any material and human resources that are beneficial to the Greater East Asia War or beneficial to the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Although China's strength is weak, its determination is firm and its belief is solid. I am very honored to be able to broadcast for the second time in your country today, and I am even more pleased that I have not failed the prediction of the broadcast three years ago. The future of China and Japan is bright, and the Greater East Asia War is bound to be victorious. I wish you all good health and I wish you all hard work.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Visits Wounded Soldiers</p>

<p>Attending the Social Gathering</p>

<p>Answering Questions from Reporters</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Special Envoy of the National Government to Japan, Chen Gongbo, met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel at 2:00 pm today and answered questions from the reporters. The following is a record of the questions and answers.</p>
<p>The reporter group asked, what is the current situation of the National Government's establishment of a decisive battle system after China's participation in the war? Special Envoy Chen answered, for the National Government to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War, since the end of last year, it has been steadily preparing the decisive battle system. In September of last year, a military organization reform committee was established, and it entered the pre-war system. In the military aspect, a policy of cooperating with Japan was adopted. Last year, after the Chairman visited Japan and returned to China, on January 9th, China resolutely stood on the common front with Japan to defeat Britain and the United States. In order to adapt to the new situation, the National Government re-established the Supreme National Defense Council and established a system for actively promoting various policies. In the economic aspect, on March 16th, the restrictions on the movement of goods were relaxed, and all of China's resources were concentrated on the foundation of completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, in short, the National Government's establishment of a decisive battle system is now being implemented in the military, political, and economic aspects. At the same time, the National Government's policies can fully reflect China's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. The reporter group asked, what is the focus of the National Government's national policy, which is concentrated on the foundation of completing the war? Special Envoy Chen answered, the National Government concentrates all the strength of materials and spirit on completing the Greater East Asia War, and especially pays attention to the problem of people. When training the national army, it actively imparts national ideological and spiritual training to thoroughly understand the original face of East Asia, and strengthens its determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. This kind of national training is the foundation organization for building a new China, so it is extremely important. The reporter group asked, what is the trend of the Chinese people and the National Government's policy of guiding the people after China's participation in the war? Special Envoy Chen answered, regarding the National Government's policy of guiding the people after participation in the war, it will further actively launch the New National Movement, in order to establish a mobilization system for sharing life and death with the friendly nation of Japan. There are three fundamental principles of the National Movement, namely: one, to advance from individualism to state centralism; two, to transform liberal capitalism into state social capitalism; and three, to advance from narrow nationalism to state groupism. After the launch of this National Movement, most of the people have swept away their old concepts in the past, and at the same time, the belief that they are not only Chinese citizens, but also a member of Greater East Asia will gradually become consolidated. The trend of the Chinese people after China's participation in the war can be said to be concentrated on contributing all their strength to this Greater East Asia War. Before participation, a small number of people once believed that China's future was hopeless, but after participation, they were clearly shown the path they should take. The people then deeply knew that the Greater East Asia War was their own war, and that if it failed, it would mean the destruction of China. Therefore, they concentrated all their human and material resources on the Greater East Asia War, and their determination to complete the war was even stronger. Moreover, participation in the Greater East Asia War is not only an obligation for every Chinese person, but also an honor. Therefore, the trend of the Chinese people's hearts is actually quite optimistic. The reporter group asked, what impact will the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of goods in Central China and the abolition of the issuance of military notes have on the economic circles of Shanghai and other places, and what are the strategies for Shanghai's economic recovery and stability? Special Envoy Chen answered, Shanghai has always been the distribution center for goods in Central China. Shanghai's economic activities were based on the transportation of products from Shanghai to the inland, and the transportation of raw materials from the inland to Shanghai. However, after the Sino-Japanese Incident, due to the influence of various aspects, it lost its function as a distribution center for goods, and at the same time, it caused the economy of Central China to fall into stagnation. After the implementation of the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of goods on the 16th of last month, activities between Shanghai and the inland resumed. The exchange of goods between various places and Shanghai will definitely become smoother in the future. Therefore, various factories in Shanghai can obtain raw materials and sell products in the market, so they are gradually restoring their old appearance. Moreover, increasing production with the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods and exporting to foreign countries has also started. The reporter group asked, after Shanghai lost its international city character in the past, what is the new character of the new Shanghai in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? Special Envoy Chen answered, Shanghai's character in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should of course break away from its international nature in the past, and should be based on the international nature in Greater East Asia. This means that only the significance of international nature has changed, so that it can develop as an economic center in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is not only the status of the new Shanghai, but also the character of the new Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Flies to Fukuoka to Attend Medical Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to Fukuoka telephone reports, Chu Minyi, the Foreign Minister of the National Government, arrived in Fukuoka by plane at 2:10 PM today from Nanjing, accompanied by Chu Tongwei, Director of the Bureau of Technical Health of the Nanjing Special Municipal Government, etc., in his capacity as Chairman of the China Branch of the First East Asia Medical Conference. After staying overnight in Fukuoka, they are scheduled to take a train east at 7:06 PM on the 11th. Upon arriving in Fukuoka, Mr. Chu stated that his visit to Japan was not in his capacity as Foreign Minister, but as a medical scholar. He then stated that, regarding the relationship between China and Japan, as of January 9th of this year, it has been decided to complete the common war under the great principle of shared life and death. This is the result of our people's recognition of the importance of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our people all say that this war is a war of liberation. Recently, thanks to Japan's support, the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have made the Chinese people even more aware of its significance. The most important of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacies is the abolition of unequal treaties. In particular, as the chairman of the committee for receiving concessions, I bear direct responsibility. I am very gratified that I was able to successfully complete the task in just three months after taking office.</p>

<h3>Senior Officials of Military Affairs Commission Hasten to Complete Handover Procedures</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the position of Chief of General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission became vacant due to Liu Yufen's illness, the National Government authorities, considering that the position should not be vacant for long during this period of all-out participation in the war, decided at the tenth Supreme National Defense Conference to appoint Bao Wenyue as the successor to the Chief of General Staff, and Ye Peng and Huang Ziqiang as replacements for the Minister of the Army and Director-General of Training, respectively. It is understood that after receiving their orders, the senior officials are now actively completing the handover procedures, and it is rumored that they will take office in their new positions within the next week.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Orders Abolition of Shāmian Special District Office</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - The former British concession in Shamian of this city was forcibly leased by the British during the eleventh year of the Xianfeng reign of the late Qing Dynasty and used as a base for aggression. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it was taken over by friendly nation Japan. Subsequently, on February 28th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), Japan issued a statement transferring the administrative power of concessions such as Tianjin and Guangzhou to our country. The administrative power of the former British concession in Shamian was returned to our administration on March 25th of the same year. After our takeover, the provincial government established the Shamian Special District Office to meet the needs of the time, appointing a district head to manage the district's administrative affairs and establishing senior and deputy counselors to assist. Now that our country is participating in the war, friendly nations have successively returned the exclusive concessions in various places to our country, which shows that friendly nations are assisting our country and strengthening it even more. In this regard, the provincial government believes that there is no need to set up a special district in Shamian, so it has decided to abolish the Shamian Special District, integrate it into the administrative area of Guangzhou, and remove the positions of senior and deputy counselors in order to unify the administrative system and strengthen administrative efficiency. The friendly authorities have also found this to be an appropriate measure. It is also rumored that the provincial government has separately ordered the Special District Office, the Guangzhou Municipal Government, and the Police Department to comply with the procedures and implement them soon. After the abolition of the Special District Office, general administration will be subordinate to the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Regarding security matters, the Provincial Capital Police Department will be instructed to set up the Shamian Police Bureau to take charge of handling them.</p>

<h3>British Army on the Tangbak Position on the Indian-Burmese Border in Danger of Being Encircled; Internal Discord Within the British Indian Army Causes Chaos; Wavell May Abandon the Attack on the Burmese Border</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - New Delhi dispatch: According to news from the British Indian Army Headquarters yesterday, the unexpected delay in the supply of military supplies may indicate that General Wavell has abandoned his attack on the Indian-Burmese border. The Tangbak position in the Arakan area is in danger of being encircled by the Japanese army and must be abandoned. The arrival of the rainy season will also prevent all supplies from arriving on time.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - At 12:00 PM today, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that the Imperial Army's troops had continuously attacked the 6th British Indian Brigade, which was surrounded near the coast of the Indian region of Bengal, and had annihilated it by April 8th, capturing its brigade commander, Gabang Dish.</p>
<p>Hanoi, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Reuters correspondents on the Indian-Burmese front received here, the British Indian army on the Mayu Peninsula north of Tumbrek on the Indian-Burmese border has been isolated by the Japanese army's encirclement. The Japanese army has now advanced to 20 miles from the Indian-Burmese border.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues Mopping Up 6th British Indian Brigade</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement and annihilation of the British Indian army on the Indian-Burmese border, the center of the battle has moved to the coastal area between the Mayu Mountains and the Bay of Bengal. The vicinity of Indin, about 10 kilometers north of Tombaku, has now become the center of the battle. After encircling the main force of the enemy's 6th Brigade in the area, the Japanese army had annihilated it by the morning of the 8th. The brigade commander Gabang Dish was also captured. The 6th Brigade originally intended to advance towards Akyab from Tombaku and Laungchaung on the Mayu Peninsula, but was ultimately unsuccessful due to the Japanese army's brave resistance. Its main force was finally surrounded by the Japanese army near Indin. Since the 5th, the encirclement has gradually narrowed. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly, they ultimately failed to escape their fate of annihilation on the morning of the 8th. Most of the officers and soldiers, including Brigade Commander Gabang Dish, were also completely captured. The enemy's dream of retaking Akyab, claiming the strongest force of the enemy's 6th Brigade, was finally annihilated. The Japanese army is now continuing to form local encirclements and mop up the remnants of the enemy in various places.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Broadcasts the Progress of the Battle to Annihilate the Enemy in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Colonel Sasaki Katsumi, a member of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Press Department, broadcast on the Central Radio Station here at 7:30 PM on the 9th, elaborating on the battle of the large-scale encirclement and annihilation north of the Indian-Burmese border by the Japanese River, as announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 8th. The general idea was that after the head of the US Lend-Lease Bureau in Chongqing, Lai Yi, recently returned to the US from Chongqing, in order to emphasize aid to the Chongqing faction, he highly advocated the necessity of retaking Burma, saying that the US policy towards Chongqing had been criticized by critics, etc., because the US aid to Chongqing was still far from the necessary amount. Judging from the actual situation, under the situation where Japan controlled the Chinese coastline and the Yunnan-Burma Road, it was impossible to transport a large number of weapons to Chongqing. Even if there were good intentions towards Chongqing in words, or a deep understanding of the superior position occupied by Japan in its attack on China, it must first be recognized that it was extremely difficult to aid Chongqing before suitable land routes were opened up. This proves the necessity of retaking Burma, and it can be seen that retaking Burma requires a sufficient force. In addition, Song Meiling said in the US Congress that Japan now possesses greater resources in its occupied territories than Germany, and it must not be forgotten that the longer these resources are placed in Japan, the stronger Japan will become. The American public opinion seemed to agree with these words. The New York Times and others said that the anti-Axis countries had made a desperate gamble in the Orient, which was the question of whether the Chongqing faction could support before the anti-Axis countries had completed preparations for an attack on Japan. If this gambling method failed, the anti-Axis countries would encounter unprecedented tragic circumstances. Australian Prime Minister Curtin has also recently lamented, "Perhaps one day, we will unite with Japan." The UK and the US are using the Soviet Union in Europe and driving the Chongqing faction in East Asia to respectively contain Germany and Japan, causing them to consume their war power and national power. At this time, they are implementing the expansion of armaments, and after their preparations are completed, they will launch a major counter-offensive against the Axis countries. This is their fundamental policy for guiding the war. Now that the UK and US strategic bases in East Asia have been destroyed, and all important resource areas have been completely lost, the offensive against Japan has become extremely difficult in terms of both space and time. The only Chongqing faction they rely on has also become increasingly exhausted recently. After Japan changed its new policy, its war of resistance has completely disappeared. The US, which wants to satisfy its own desires by sacrificing the Chongqing faction, now has no other way to save its own destiny except to rely on the Chongqing faction due to the situation of the Greater East Asia War. The degree of anxiety of the US at this critical moment can be imagined. In the general war situation at the moment, before attacking Japan, the US believed that it was necessary to transport materials to Chongqing first in order to maintain the life of the Chongqing faction, but now it has not reached that goal.</p>

<h3>Military and Political Facilities in Malaya and Sumatra</h3>
<p>Under the Great East Asia War, due to the brave and resolute battles of the Japanese army, they have successively occupied enemy territories. A part of their operations has also shifted to military administration, adopting the means of consolidating the war. The purpose of operations is to achieve the direct war objectives, while military administration is a powerful means of assistance to ensure the fulfillment of these direct objectives. Therefore, the main tasks of military administration are to restore security in the occupied territories, rapidly obtain important materials, and strengthen the local self-sufficiency of the operations, which are carried out by the military itself. If the tasks of military administration can be fully carried out, the operational area will have a strong advance, the production war can be ensured, and a long-term decisive battle posture to cultivate combat power can be perfected. Therefore, the success or failure of the military administration organization is greatly related to Japan's complete victory.</p>
<p>General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the supreme commander in Malaya, had deeply felt the uniqueness of this war's form even before the start of the operations. He then established a broad and thorough operational plan, and in its integral relationship, secretly ordered a group of staff officers to devise a comprehensive military administration plan. This was so that after occupying Malaya, military administration could be implemented immediately according to this plan, in order to fulfill the operational objectives. On one hand, the military administration objectives were achieved, and on the other hand, other operations could be greatly assisted. This is truly the vision of an enlightened general and his staff. Because the Japanese army had such thorough preparations, the anxieties behind were completely eliminated, leading the enemy to mistakenly believe that there were several times more Japanese troops attacking, forcing them to surrender. Therefore, after the advance on the Malay Peninsula, like a raging torrent rushing southward, a solemn military administration branch was soon established. The administrative functions of British rule were completely taken over by the Japanese, and administration emerged with a new face. Thus, before the fall of Singapore, the Japanese military administration had already been fully implemented on the Malay Peninsula. However, after the fall of Singapore, the basic policy of the Malayan military administration, which was completed between the subjugation of Burma and the incomplete occupation of Sumatra and Java, was the first attempt by Japan, so it was repeatedly refined to ensure caution. The essential points of the Malayan military administration established in Taiping (Thipeng) were created with utmost effort. A month before the fall of Singapore, the military administration staff took this plan to the headquarters and discussed specific matters carefully. Therefore, it became the basic plan for the essential points of military administration after the Great East Asia War, and a model for the military administration organization. In this sense, the military administration in Malaya is quite interesting.</p>
<p>The model of the Malayan military administration is different from that in the Philippines and Burma, which uses the administrative government composed of indigenous people under Japanese command. It adopts a method of the Japanese army's own administration, which goes without saying. The characteristic of the Malayan military administration is that it establishes a firm policy in advance for the unoccupied territories, and also prepares a detailed and concrete plan for the operation of the administrative organization, which is implemented immediately after the occupation. Therefore, regarding the organization of the special city of Syonan (Singapore), the selection of the heads, the abolition of the branches and the establishment of states, and the establishment of appropriate leaders in the states, talented and competent people were assessed in various fields in Japan before the fall of Singapore, in preparation for appointment. Moreover, when the candidates were decided, they were ordered to take office and bear the responsibility of rapidly restoring local security. This kind of rapid measure amidst the smoke and fire of war is really eye-catching.</p>
<p>The military administration in Sumatra is slightly different from that in Malaya. On February 15th of last year, after the Japanese army arrived in Palembang, the subjugation operation of the entire Sumatra was completed in just over a month, and the military administration began to be implemented under the Malayan military administration department. Although its military administration followed the Malayan military administration, it was carried out in accordance with the local situation. However, the military administrations of Malaya and Sumatra have not been implemented unchanged from the military administration a year ago. Once the Great East Asia War entered the decisive stage, it was natural to anticipate the enemy's counterattack, and therefore the military administration took on the important task of defending the occupied territories. In particular, Sumatra, facing the Indian Ocean from the Andaman Islands and facing the enemy's counterattack attempts, is more important than Malaya. Moreover, because Sumatra is rich in resources, it has always been said that "whoever controls Sumatra can win a hundred years of war." Therefore, the military administration of Sumatra, in addition to the general purpose of military administration, also has two major objectives: defense and resource development, and its tasks are more important than those of Malaya. Moreover, Sumatra is known as the world's treasure house, and the efforts required in the future are far greater than those already investigated in Malaya. Therefore, although the military administration of Sumatra is managed by the same supervisory department as the military administration of Malaya, its characteristics are different. At this stage, Sumatra is being required for thorough defense and resource development. In view of the importance of Malaya and Sumatra, the reporter is here to report on the military administration status of Malaya and Sumatra.</p>
<p>National Issues and Public Security</p>
<p>The national question is an important issue of governance, and the Japanese army clearly stated its guiding principles in the previous basic policy of military administration. Needless to say, only with the sincere cooperation of the local residents can the complete implementation of military administration policies be expected. This is a matter of course, but it must be adapted to the specific characteristics of each locality to implement various forms of governance. Looking at the races currently residing in Malaya and Sumatra, if you ask whether Malaya is the Malaya of Malays, as the name suggests, it is better to answer in terms of its population, which is the Malaya of overseas Chinese. Before the war, overseas Chinese accounted for 2.3 million out of the total population of 5.4 million in Malaya (i.e., 42.6%, and as high as 75% in Syonan Island), while the indigenous Malays were only 2.25 million (41.6%). The next largest group was Indians, accounting for 13.8%. Malaya has always been a peninsula where many races live together, and the streets often look like a human exhibition. On the other hand, among the total population of 8.5 million in Sumatra, there are only over 400,000 overseas Chinese. Except for a few others, the remaining 7.8 million are Malays. Among the Malays, although they are divided into several tribes such as the Acehnese, Minangkabau, and Batak, they are generally composed of a single race. When the Dutch first ruled Sumatra, they did not govern the Acehnese properly, so they used force against the tribe, making it impossible to implement military administration. This was because the administration lacked these two major considerations. In this sense, the handling of local chieftains must also be emphasized. For example, in Sumatra, the division of one tribe into one state and the participation of local chieftains in local administration as ethnic leaders, in addition to police administration and material distribution, all other local administration is entrusted to them. This current situation is a fitting measure. As long as the language, religion, customs, and habits of the local residents are the same, they will naturally move towards assisting the new order without other forces.</p>
<p>Resources of Malaya and Sumatra</p>
<p>Malaya and Sumatra each have their own unique resources. First, let's talk about Malaya. As is well known, Malaya has been famous for rubber and tin since before the war. Tin produced in Malaya accounts for 30% of the world's production. The main production area, Perak State, accounts for about 60%, and other states such as Selangor, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan also have production. In terms of refining, whether it is mining or refining, it is starting successively, and there have been achievements beyond expectations. As for rubber, with the establishment of the Syonan Rubber Company in the future, rubber plantations that seem to be abandoned are also being restored one after another. Now we are only waiting for the activities of the entire rubber industry. The two major industries in Malaya have been restored so smoothly, so we are now eagerly awaiting their full contribution to the decisive battle. Among the resources in Malaya, there are also resources necessary for aircraft manufacturing that cannot be taken lightly. At a time when resource development is being demanded, Malaya is doing everything it can, and now it is only a matter of how to activate it.</p>
<p>Sumatra is a large island with different resources from Malaya. Whether its resources have not yet been developed or fully investigated is still unclear. Since the Japanese army arrived on the island, the world-famous Palembang oil has been owned by the Japanese army. The oil veins running east-west along the northern coast of Sumatra have become the Palembang oilfield area. The leader of East Asia, Japan, is now replacing British and American capital to control this large oil field. All the equipment has been taken over by the Japanese army and is stepping up production to contribute to complete victory. Rubber and tin both surpassed Malaya before the war, and now tin (Bangka Belitung) and rubber (throughout the island) will be comparable to Malaya.</p>
<p>Agricultural Resources and Local Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>The main agricultural products of Malaya and Sumatra can be said to be rubber. The rubber production situation has been described above, but it is necessary to study the use of rubber in considerable detail. In addition, the local processing and refining of rubber is also necessary to implement as soon as possible. Now a part of the rubber can be converted into fuel substitutes (rubber oil), etc., and research is continuing, and new uses will soon be discovered. In addition to rubber, Sumatra also produces palm oil and other South Seas agricultural products. As for the main food for local residents, rice and salt, the production has always been insufficient and must rely on imports from Thailand and Burma. In the decisive battle, it is difficult for the local area to be self-sufficient, so the Japanese army authorities are working hard for this, and at the same time, the increase in rice production has been amazing. Improvements are also being made to rice cultivation, and methods of harvesting twice or three times a year are being reviewed. In Sumatra, it is believed that self-sufficiency can be achieved next year. In Malaya, the rice produced in Kedah State is also transferred to other states, and Kelantan State hopes to be self-sufficient this year. Negeri Sembilan and Malacca have set a three-year plan. The military administration supervisory department has set up a food production increase team, which is seeking to cultivate alternative foods such as tapioca, sweet potatoes, and corn to make up for the shortage, in order to establish a self-sufficiency attitude.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of the investigation of forest resources in the jungle area, the value of many resources has long been expected. Sumatra has always been rich in agricultural products except for rice, such as tea, fiber, Derris root (an insecticide), quinine, senna, castor, rosin, coffee, black tea, tobacco, vegetables, etc. Forest resources such as mahogany and iron-wood are also very rich.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Japanese army's self-sufficiency goal has almost been achieved; not only that, Sumatra's self-sufficiency, which has always taken the so-called biased form of dependence on foreign countries, is also approaching the state of Manchuria step by step with its solid steps.

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Declaration of the Establishment of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association: Shanghai was one of the earliest places to open up as a commercial port. It now has more than four million citizens and occupies a central position in the country's economy. It is a place where talents gather in terms of culture, and merchants from various countries gather, making it a major international city in East Asia. However, looking back on the past, there have been people who sought the prosperity and stability of Shanghai, and there have been efforts made with great enthusiasm. However, some have focused on the welfare of only a portion of the people without a holistic view. Therefore, Shanghai still has a distorted development and prosperity, which is not yet fully in line with our ideals. For example, citizens are still suffering from insecurity in their lives and have no support for their welfare. This is because the local gentry and people of insight have not yet been able to come forward, based on the spirit of autonomy, to seek the welfare of the citizens with the power of the locality. The rise and fall, governance and chaos of Shanghai are related to the national policies, and the implementation of national policies depends on the support of the people and the support of the people's strength. To seek the development of the people's strength, we must first rely on the sound local autonomous organization, the elimination of bad habits, and the elimination of concerns about the safety of life and property for everyone. Citizens have the guarantee of freedom and welfare, and the people can get what they deserve, live in peace, and enjoy their work. Only then can we hope that they will do their best, love their hometown together, and lay the foundation for a prosperous country and a strong people. We and others are not talented, but we have seen this and deeply feel the importance of our responsibility. Therefore, we dare not resign from the simplicity and organize this association to concentrate local manpower, study local reform affairs, and dedicate ourselves to maintaining the welfare of our citizens. We also hope to further promote the public opinion of the citizens, lay the foundation for autonomy, and lead Shanghai to a stable path. At the beginning of the founding, we first set up three creeds: First, we will not discuss anything that does not fall within the scope of the welfare of the citizens; second, we will not discuss anything that falls within the scope of the welfare of the citizens but does not require the use of group power; third, for matters of citizen welfare established through discussion by this association, whether positive or negative, we should use suggestions to contact relevant parties. All these are the principles for seeking the welfare of the citizens of Shanghai today, and also the basis for our people to work together with the authorities to seek the prosperity and stability of Shanghai. We deeply hope that advanced people from all walks of life will actively participate, and that the authorities will do their best to help and achieve success together. Then the four million citizens of Shanghai will be very fortunate, and the future of the country and East Asia will be very fortunate. The temporary address of the association is temporarily located at Room 301, Bank Association, Hong Kong Road.</p>
<h3>Verification of Account Books for Money Shops Completed</h3>
<h3>Leads for Speculation and Hoarding Identified</h3>
<h3>Punishment Should Be Based on Loan Accounts</h3>
<p>In order to crack down on speculation and hoarding in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles, the National Government ordered the dispatch of personnel for thorough investigation. After Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo and others arrived in Shanghai, they reached an agreement on the verification methods.</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter, according to a Central News Agency reporter who learned from reliable sources, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, together with relevant financial institutions in the city, had earlier thoroughly investigated the business accounts of various financial institutions in the city (such as banks, money shops, and trust companies) and the circumstances of mortgage loans. It was found that some banks with strong financial strength had extended large amounts of mortgage loans to clients, who were suspected of speculation and hoarding. The investigators have obtained clues about these individuals and will investigate the addresses of the owners of the hoarded goods based on the mortgage loan accounts of the banks. The reporter also learned from authoritative sources in the banking industry that various banks and money shops in the city have tightened their lending business to industry and commerce, and the Central Reserve Bank is also planning to further tighten interbank lending. However, after verification, legitimate industrial and commercial loans that are actually used for people's livelihood or the regulation of materials will be lent as much as possible. It is reported that various banks and money shops are also simultaneously recovering illegal loans. At the same time, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai has also taken the same measures as the National Government to strengthen the crackdown on speculation. He issued a statement on the 10th, stating that the National Government's order on the 7th was very timely under the current circumstances. The Japanese Consulate-General announced regulations on the prohibition of illegal profiteering at the end of January last year, and has been strictly cracking down on hoarding and refusal to sell. In the future, it will take the same steps as the National Government to strengthen the crackdown. It is hoped that Japanese residents will understand the intentions of the authorities and cooperate with them. Anyone who violates the above regulations will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>A Woman's Corpse Revived in a Funeral Home in the South City</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday, in a funeral home in the South City, a woman's corpse, Gao Ruan, suddenly came back to life. The people in the funeral home were greatly frightened. It was found that Gao Ruan was four months pregnant and had a serious illness. She had been refused treatment by a hospital some days ago and died yesterday morning. She was sent to the funeral home at around 10:00 AM. Unexpectedly, she revived after four hours. The funeral home notified her family. The people in the funeral home sympathized with Gao Ruan's illness and poverty, and not only did they not charge any fees, but they also provided medical assistance and raised money to donate. When our reporter heard the news, he went to see her out of sympathy and helped the patient's family to arrange medical treatment and escorted her home.</p>
<h3>Renewed Crackdown on Pickpocketing</h3>
<p>The police have noticed an increase in pickpocketing cases recently and have posted propaganda slogans on the walls of major roads today to urge residents to pay attention. The purpose is to (1) apprehend all pickpockets, (2) warn those who intend to join the ranks of pickpockets, and (3) urge residents not to be negligent in their prevention. It is also learned that the two foreign concessions will set up a reconnaissance network from today to cooperate in dealing with the concealment of pickpockets.</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchant Cigarette Factory Products to be Distributed Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Translated Commentary: Reactions from All Sides to the Order to Investigate Hoarding</h3>
<p>The order to investigate speculative trading issued on the 7th under the name of the chairman is a sharp warning to hoarders. As a result, the key to stabilizing people's livelihoods and revitalizing the economy in Shanghai can be eliminated. At the same time, it is sufficient to prevent major officials of financial institutions or those who occupy important positions in politics from engaging in speculative behavior. This order has aroused significant reactions in the economic, political, and public opinion circles of the concession. Before the National Government announced this order, it was said that the speculators in Shanghai, who were extremely high-ranking officials, often paid with huge post-dated checks. It is said that evidence has been found that these funds were used for speculation and hoarding. Shen Bao published an editorial on the 6th entitled "Requesting the Government to Resolve to Ban Hoarding." This editorial differed from the calls for banning hoarding in the Chinese newspapers in the past. The points it pointed out were sharp and straightforward, highlighting the seriousness of the politics and clarifying the scale of speculative trading in Shanghai's financial circles, making readers nod their heads and arousing the concern of people from all walks of life in China. From the 4th to the 7th, the trends in various circles in China, as long as the current serious political and economic situation in Shanghai is made clear, can be judged. In this regard, the opinions of informed people from all walks of life in the concession can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) People are celebrating and welcoming this order issued by Chairman Wang. The Chinese people still remember that there was a similar order in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), but because of the power of the Kong Xiangxi faction, the government order could not be implemented, and it disappeared without any practical effect. It is hoped that Chairman Wang will not repeat the same mistake, and at the same time, it is believed that he will definitely be able to take the step of doing what he says.</p>
<p>(2) If the government only suppresses small-scale speculative groups in the future, and does not immediately report and use financial institutions and political forces to engage in large-scale speculation, and hesitates, then this clear order can only eliminate a part of the people and cannot achieve a comprehensive clean-up to create honest politics.</p>
<p>(3) It is an undeniable fact that the leaders of various banks and enterprise companies maintain close relations with political forces and use them as shields. The emergence of large-scale speculation is the result of this kind of sectarian cooperation between officials and merchants. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to clearly define the boundaries between officials and merchants.</p>
<p>(4) The results of the investigation need to be made public to the people. This is a good strategy for stabilizing people's hearts, and more impartial people from the private sector should be added to the investigation committee.</p>
<p>(5) In short, the important issue in the future is to prevent political forces from being used behind speculation, rather than to prevent speculation. Only by separating officials from merchants can we eradicate all kinds of large and small speculations.</p>
<p>(6) After the Japanese side changed its economic policy, it is promoting a new materials policy. The current situation in Shanghai is regrettable in Sino-Japanese cooperation, which makes the authorities have to issue this order to overcome this bad situation. This can be said to be the biggest problem in the current Sino-Japanese cooperation. (Yun Peng: Translated from the April 16th issue of the Mainland News)</p>
<h3>Money Shop Industry Resolves That Commodity-Guaranteed Loans be Limited to Members of Industry Associations</h3>
<h3>Letters Sent to Various Industries Requesting Membership Rosters</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the use of commodity-guaranteed financing and the promotion of hoarding and speculation, the Money Shop Industry Association has resolved to follow the law and limit all commodity-guaranteed loans in the future to members of various industry associations. Loans shall not be made to non-industry association members or commodity firms that have not been registered. According to reliable information obtained by a Shanghai Social Reporter from the Money Shop Industry, the Bank Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to inform the various industry associations in the city to submit the membership rosters of their respective associations for printing and distribution to various banks and money shops for reference as a basis for lending. It is said that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that there is nothing wrong with the association's request, and has sent separate letters to the various industry associations, limiting them to submit their membership rosters to the association within ten days, so that they can be forwarded to the Bank Association together. Those who intend to stand by and fail to perform this procedure will not be able to enjoy mortgage loans guaranteed by commodities in the future.</p>
<h3>Central Market Convened General Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>The various industry groups in the Central Market were established one after another last month. Therefore, the market convened a general assembly of various centralized distribution and shipping groups, as well as responsible personnel from the former brokers' associations, at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 people attended, including Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, representative of the Municipal Government, Staff Officer Fukuyama of the Japanese Army, and guests from various parties. First, Market Director Tao and Deputy Market Director Ikeda gave speeches. Then, Staff Officer Fukuyama and Secretary-General Zhao gave training speeches and issued awards. Finally, Association Representative Xu Xiangsheng gave a reply and announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Adjusts Various Guilds - Deadline for Submission Extended by Ten Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, in order to comply with the regulations of the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the government, is adjusting and reorganizing all kinds of existing economic organizations that are unsuitable for the wartime economic system. Previously, all industry and commerce groups in the city were specifically instructed that all federations of industries, joint business offices, trade guilds, and similar organizations that had not been approved and registered before must submit reports for verification by April 10. It is now learned that the deadline expired yesterday, and most of the trade guilds for major commodities have complied with the order and submitted reports to the bureau. However, there are still many trade guilds for non-major commodities that have not submitted reports. Therefore, the bureau, in consideration of the interests of merchants and the people, has extended the deadline for the submission of reports by trade guilds in various industries by ten days, until the 20th of this month, so that trade guilds in various industries that have not yet submitted reports can complete the submission procedures within the extended deadline.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Administration Bureau Formulates - Provisional Measures for Specially Contracted Fish Ponds</h3>
<p>In order to improve aquaculture technology and increase fish production, the Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food has formulated a set of provisional measures for specially contracted fish ponds, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Anyone who owns or publicly owns a pond suitable for fish and shellfish farming with an area of more than three mu and has two years of fish farming experience may fill out an application form and a guarantee, together with a detailed map of the pond and documents proving ownership or leasehold rights, and submit it to the bureau for approval and registration, issuance of a certificate, and promulgation of a notice for protection. (2) Specially contracted fish ponds shall enjoy priority when the bureau allocates or lends improved fish fry and fish species. (3) If fish diseases or fish plagues occur in specially contracted fish ponds, the bureau shall be promptly notified of the disease situation for guidance and prevention. (4) Ponds located in fish market areas may be operated exclusively or jointly by the market as a matter of course and recognized as specially contracted fish ponds.</p>
