<h3>從政治說謊談到禁烟</h3>
<p>— 陳孚木</p>
<p>政治的卑鄙　大於說　，中國政治之壞，就壞在執政的人們，　知說謊　老百姓，而絕不想着怎樣眞正實行改良政治。三年前國府還都，汪主席曾提出一個口號：『說老實話，　責任』。我感學凡是一個政府，他若然能够難得民心的擁護，不需要一定弄些堂　偉大的計劃，和宣傳一些什麽高深莫測的政綱和主義。他祇要能够實心實力拿定了『除惡務盡，從善如流』的決心，爲了興家，爲了人民，見件做一件，說得出，就做得出來，一點不說謊話，不作假事，讓人民知　道個政府是眞正『　利除弊』足與爲善的，那麽這個政府再加以有　大堂　的計劃和政綱，人民不特會相信，而且必定鼓舞激動以從。</p>
<p>中國政治說謊之例舉起來不祇萬千，說也說不盡。我現在要舉出一件最卑鄙無恥的政治說謊，就是所謂『禁烟』。鴉片烟之爲禍，足以亡種亡國，那是婦孺皆知的道理，我毋庸再虛化文字去形容　。中國政府提倡禁烟有一百多年的歷史，到現在不特烟沒有禁絕，而且變本加厲，花樣翻新，政府以此籌餉，官吏靠此發財，名曰禁烟，實際就是推銷雅片，唯恐人民知其毒而不多吸，更巧立名目，明明是鴉片毒品，却美其名曰『戒烟藥膏』。明明是吸烟室，却名之曰『戒烟室』。明明是販賣鴉片的罪惡所在，却名之曰『戒烟所』。以此『戒烟藥膏』爲例，擴而充之，則政治上說謊騙人，貪汚就是廉潔，賣國就是愛國，聚歛就是賬濟，枉法就是守法，種種罪惡無一不可給以美名欺世，所謂政治信用，國法紀綱都等於空話了。北洋軍閥執政時代，昏天暗地，無法無天，他們玩什麽花樣去滿足他們的政治罪惡，可不必談他了。十餘年前，國民黨以革命的新姿態起而執政，却發明了這無恥的名同販賣鴉片，而不加改正，輿論界也見怪不怪沒有人指摘，這眞是痛心的事。然而民問傳語『革命黨人好話說盡，惑事做盡』這『戒烟藥膏』也許就是其中之一吧！</p>
<p>想起當民國十四年國民政府初成立時，革命空氣蓬勃，百凡施政曾有一番新氣象。廖仲凱先生任財政部長，他會和我懇切的談過他的新禁烟計劃，命我在實施計劃時在報紙上盡點鼓吹的責任。他有一句很有價値的話，他說：『有人以爲眞正禁烟，是會妨磚財政的，但是我認爲愈要眞正禁烟，財政愈有辦法』。可惜這個國民黨的領導者而又是最有勇氣的實際政治家，在他擬訂眞正禁烟計劃後沒有幾天便給兇徒暗殺死了。從此以後，國民黨政權漸漸流入一些流氓意識和洋奴意識及那些『銀蝨』的人們手上，只知政權與財寫之寳貴外，正義感就很少。而『革命黨人好話說盡，惡事做盡』的頌詞便從民衆口中唱出來了。</p>
<p>還有我的一件史實，就是民十五年夏，宋子文任財政部長，廣販鴉片和寵用有烟癖的人主辦財政，和當時國民政府政令顯有遠背。（國民政府命令各機關不得任用吸食鴉片者爲公務員）我那時任監察委員，曾向國民政府彈劾宋子文。蔣介石命我的同鄉當時任公安局長的李章達先生來談說，現在北伐大軍將要出發，彈劾宋子文動榣財政，等於阻撓北伐大計，請將公文撤回。尙時我答覆他：『官吏違反黨和政府的政策，提出彈劾是我的職權，總司令無權干預，至於動榣財政阻撓北伐我不承認，如果要遠背黨和政府的政策始能北伐，則不如不北伐』。其時國民政府是譚延閣先生代理主席，也和我說：『介石很爲那彈劾案不痛快，國民政府不好批辦，不如暫行撤回』。我答覆他：『批辦不批辦是主席的職權，彈劾官吏違法是我的職權，我不能瀆棄我的職務把彈案撤回』。那件案國民政府結果未曾批辦，而那可恨可恥的『戒烟藥膏』的大謊一直就瞎扯到現在。聞說近年來有幾個地方戲法變得更妙了，把販烟土的組織題名曰『善堂』，這眞善哉！善哉！無以復加矣。</p>
<p>中國政治中人有兩件最沒有出息的事：第一，沒出息作事務欲得美名『其實政治脫不了善惡的兩面。作事總求有肩膀，有良心，有作爲，對得住國家，對得住人民，何必樣樣都要盜美名以掩飾。像近年來政治上的作僞與說謊，實有使人聞之難堪的，如收賭餉美之曰『防務經費』，發行彩票美之曰『慈善』，而抽收妓女捐美之曰『敎育經費』，使莘莘學子讀書與妓女賣藝聯在一起，則更是不堪之又不堪者了。其實政府如有肩膀有責任有氣，魄無論賭捐與妓損，正可與其他捐稅收入一樣，有計劃而又用之於正，那麽犯不着取些無聊的美名去遮羞。如果政治上每件都要想一善美之名，則監獄何妨改作『樂園』，劊子手改爲『送王婆』，豈不滑天下之大稽。第二，沒出息天天勸人民取法聖賢，景慕英雄，却無氣魄自己要做聖賢，自作英雄。再拿禁烟爲例，政府中人談禁烟就談到林則徐，我却不明白手握政權的人爲什麼自己不想着去做林則徐第二，而僅僅在那裏誇贊林則徐？禁烟工作在林則徐時代，因爲在政府黑暗時代，外交政治都渾渾噩噩，以一人爲首倡也許遭逢困難。在目前禁烟是家喻戶曉的事，政府有了明令，也沒有洋人作梗，則每一個市的市長，某一個縣的縣長在其轄境之內就可以做林則徐。但是百多年來似乎只有一個林則徐給我們景仰，這個國家眞有點可憐了！</p>
<p>政府有沒有作　，有沒有與民　善的決心，不在多發洋洋萬言宣言，與乎那些綱條目　的偉大深奧綱領。只要從小的地方着眼。要看那些小而易舉的事有沒有實踐改善。小而且易的事，尙不願做，或且懶做，則其他不必問了。我們出了租界到南市，或沿京滬鐵路沿各城市直達南京爲止，每個市鎭，每一個里弄幾乎都有『戒烟室』或『戒烟所』，假使一個不懂中國情形的外國人看見，將如何贊賞中國禁烟行政的週到，決不會想到內容之不堪問如此田地。</p>
<p>我堅決主張任何政府都不應用美名行惡事，政府必須坦白而且有決心。只顧籌餉而不注意國家民族　根本大患已不應該，縱容人民吸烟反名爲戒烟則更不應該。說『老實話，負責任』的現國民政府要表明白不說政治謊話，根本要改革現行禁烟制度。第一步輕而易舉的事，就是嚴禁這些可恥而又卑鄙的『戒烟藥膏』等名詞。鴉片烟必須寫明是『鴉片毒膏』，販烟室應名爲『販毒烟所』承商應名爲『販賣鴉片毒烟商』，使吸者見名思義，販運者見名知所慚愧。這並不動搖財政，（眞正禁烟實有助於財政，以非本文範圍，略不贅論）却洗除了說謊話的汚點，表明政府說實話，負責任，我希望政府不因其事小而不行。</p>
<h3>如何增加工業生產</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>已往上海等處，以游資充斥，人人歆於近利，羣趨向於儲囤物資之一途，致造成物價暴漲，表面雖成畸形之繁榮，實則外强中乾，社會生活益陷於尩瘵之境。說　歸咎於游資作祟，然而游資用不得其當則有之，游資未入於正當途徑則有之，誤用游資，是社會之　，游資本身不任其咎也。今則改弦易轍，我國人此後投資應改變已往之趨向，努力增加生產，以完成戰時經濟之任務，已爲國人一致之目標。顧如何增加生產？決非一方面可以完成其職責，應全體動員，由多方面一致努力，始克達其目標，爰就管見所及，粗述其槪，以就正於邦人君子。</p>
<p>第一希望於日本當局者　中國生產落後，工業幼稚，無可偉言，日本爲工業先進之邦，在在足爲中國所師法，提携輔助，責無旁貸，値此中國生產界困難達於極點之秋，希望日本當局處處予中國生產者以便利，凡原料之供給機械之輸運，以及技術之傳授，經濟之融通，凡屬力所能及，應儘量協助，解除困難，苟內地生產界尙有感受許多痛苦之處，似宜澈底調查，嚴加取締，革除已往種種凌侮侵　之習慣，同時日本工商界旣以共存共榮爲號召，亦應抱利益均霑之義，鐲除私見，眞誠合作，俾中國生產界不絕如縷之一綫生機，不致頻於澌滅，此其一。</p>
<p>第二希望於我國政府者　政府當局，揭櫫增加生產，爲目前建國之要綱，最近惕於工商界投資方式之誤用，深知救國舍增產無他途。顧增產要旨，在便民，而非病民，苟病民之政未除，利民之效未睹，中國生產界，惟有日即蕭條，同歸澌滅而巳。目前物資交流之說，旣甚囂塵上，然甲　原料運赴乙地，旣難若登天，而節節留難，層層剝削之惡習，恐猶未盡肅淸。工業界之製品，欲其通行無阻，推銷內地，更覺難之尤難。此中癥結，如交通機構之不健全，徵收機關之未專一，金融團體服務之不周至，官廳指導與保護力量之未充分，以及種種人爲方面之缺陷，與彼此配合之脫節，我政府當局苟有決心，應在可能範圍內，予以次第之改善。爲生產界解除一分痛苦，耶爲國家增進一分力量，保留社會一分元氣，亦即政府自力更生生產救國之礎石，此其二。</p>
<p>第三希望於金融界者　金融爲生產之要素，工業界之後盾，舍金融界莫團。中國工業上惟一之困難，即爲資金之薄弱。惟其資金力薄，故工業上大規模之經營，迄今尙極感缺乏，平時最大困難：一爲利率之過高，二爲銀錢業之助力過少，三爲抵押借款興承兌貼現未盡普遍，而金融生產兩界之不能精誠合作，確爲最大病根。今後金融界對於生產放款，不當爲無目標的任意進行，當爲有步驟有意義的眞誠合作。尤其應集中精神力量，致力於幾種重要事業，作規模較大之聯絡工作。如最近之絲業借款銀團，粉麥借款銀團，以及正在磋商中之棉花借款銀團，均屬整個計畫，値得倡導贊助，爲今日銀錢界放款事業轉變之絕好氣象，推而及於農村與農業，在在均有待於金融界之始終扶掖，予以涵煦滋長之功。同時希望金融界今後亟宜羅致專門人才，對於放款工廠，施以技術上之指導與改進，須知與其厚利放款，無裨於社會國家，不如薄利放軟，大有造於生產事業。祗須在工作上有意義有貢獻，都値得做去者，抑又有進者，中央儲備銀行爲銀行之銀行，今後業務方針，應全力從事於生產方面，不論直接間接扶助工業界，以增加生產者，更當惟力是視，不稍諉卸，尤其如重貼現轉抵押等業務，以及生產銀團之贊助，胥屬當務之急，全力以赴，庶不負其應負之職責，此其三。</p>
<p>第四希望於工業界自身者　最近工業界增資之舉，風行一時，表面上爲產業增値，爲盈餘厚利，實則名爲產業增値，實以幣値减低，遂形成資產增高之帳面，紙上富貴，未可遽抱樂觀。不過因此問題，遂養成工業界僥倖之心理，只知究心於產業增値以後，如何升股增資，如何溢價發行，而於最關利益之工作問題，技術問題，以及一切組織管理等等，轉無暇措意，甚至不屑注意。說者謂生產界居今日而談人事管理，科學管理，以及工業合理化問題，似不免迂　拘謹，不適應環境者，良用浩歎。殊不知辦工業而祗知市塲價格，股價升降，不屑措意於技術管理者，結果失敗無疑。猶憶民國二十二年予等參觀日本紡織廠，廠中當局語予等曰：『日廠經理，終日在廠埋頭於技術改　及管理合理化之工作，而中國廠方當局則大部分時間在交易所中計較盈虧得失，或籌措金融奔走於銀錢界之門，蓋當時我國紗廠當局，確有未能免此缺憾者，其言大可體味，而爲我人當頭棒喝。不僅紗廠如此，經營任何工廠，在技術上管理上非用眞工夫埋頭苦幹不可。否則承平以後，優勝劣敗，其受淘汰無疑。値此過渡準備時代，正容我工業界以從　硏究改革之餘地，凡工作試騐之注意，科學管理之試行，成本會計之實施，福利事業之設施，均爲今日着手改進之　好機會，失此不圖，後悔無及，我目光遠大之工業界，當不河漢斯言。</p>

<p>東條首相發表談話</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日東條首相四日發表談話，略謂：日本爲謀生存，不得已對英。美布告宜戰後，山本元帥即任職合艦隊司令長官，不負天皇陛下之期待曁聖威下與陸軍緊密協力，以震撼世界之夏威夷及馬來兩海戰爲始，於太平洋·印度洋展開大規模作戰，到處擊潰敵軍，收獲空前之光輝大戰果，如斯於聖威下，因日軍將兵之勇敢奮戰，自開戰以來，僅一年半，即已確立必勝不敗之戰略態勢。今大東亞戰爭漸入於決戰階段，戰局愈形重大，當此之時，元帥於最前綫指揮聯合艦隊，搭海軍機與敵交戰，遂於南方海面上空壯烈戰死，以身作則，訓示全軍將兵，實堪爲一億國民之垂範。體察此雄壯武人之心情，吾人不禁熱淚橫流，元帥於第一綫指揮作戰，壯烈戰死之精神，使全軍將兵士氣愈益激昂，全國民之抗敵心更形堅强，我國民若因元帥戰死而徒喪胆失魄，此決非以慰元帥之靈。刻下內外事態不容絲毫之苟且偷安，今我一億國民之進路，唯有以元帥崇高之精神爲精神，以元帥偉大之鬥志爲鬥志，須以百戰不撓之抗戰心，向擊滅英·美之途邁進，俾安聖慮，日軍勇猛奮戰築成之必勝不敗態勢，巳吿確立，無論前綫後方，以一億一心精神，分別盡最大之努力，必可獲得光榮之勝利。於茲對元帥之戰死，衷心表示哀悼，元帥精神猶在，幷祈元帥之其福。</p>
<p>島田海相廣播示悼</p>

<p>南京五日中央社電　林宣傳部長於五日晚九時三十分至九時五十分在中央電台發表廣播演說，題爲「悼山本元帥」，茲誌全文於後：</p>
<p>友邦日本聯合艦隊司令長官山本元帥，在前綫壯烈殉職的噩耗傳來，全東亞人士莫不同深悲悼。今日爲山本元帥國葬之期，我人緬懷山本元帥過去爲保衛東亞，建立了萬世殊勳，同時瞻看大東亞戰爭勝利的光明前途，於哀悼之餘，更不勝其感奮。</p>
<p>友邦日本海軍綫中東鄉元帥之傳統精神，再經朝野人士之協力建設，早已成爲保衛東亞的海上萬里長城。此次大東亞戰爭的序慕剛一揭開，英美海軍先後在珍珠灣及昭南島附近各地被日本海軍艦隊包圍痛擊，立刻奠定了大東亞戰爭勝利的基礎。其後陸續在印度洋，南太平洋，東太平洋等處，發揮威力，獲致赫赫的戰果，把所有英美海軍勢力一掃而空，這不單是日本海軍的光榮，實在是全東亞民族的光榮。山本元帥是領導這些無敵艦隊建立光榮戰績的統帥，所以他的光榮，也就是全東亞的光榮，過去的東鄕元帥以他的豐功偉績寫出日本海軍光榮史的第一頁，我們東亞人士每一翻閱這頁光榮歷史的時候，感覺到東亞民族抵抗敵人的戰鬥精神之偉大，東亞民族保衛東亞的戰鬥力量之堅强，使全東亞民族發生無限的希望。現在山本元帥以他的戰功，以他的熱血寫成東亞海軍光榮戰史的第一頁，增加堅强全東亞民族保衛東亞的決心，振奮全東亞民族擊滅敵人的勇氣，山本元帥爲繼承東鄕元帥不朽精神的第一人，而且他把東鄉元帥的精神擴大瀰漫於全東亞宇宙之內。山本元帥以最高指揮官親臨前綫而戰死，此種日本軍人之傳統精神，更增加了全東亞民族的敬慕。山本元帥的肉體雖死，他的精神將永遠和全東亞民族保衛東亞的精神永垂不朽的。山本元帥爲保衛東亞而戰死，在大東亞戰爭尙未完成之前，我們共同參加這種神聖戰爭的東亞民族對於這位東亞民族英雄的犧牲，一面固然感到無限的悲痛，但想到日山本元帥如此壯烈殉職、實爲其本人的莫大光榮。並且山本元帥以一人的犧牲，因此感召全東亞十億戰士，產生全東亞十億戰士的山本精神，大家繼承這種偉大的不朽精神，向着全東亞民族的共同敵人作殊死戰，那末大東亞戰爭的勝利，必可加速完成，山本元帥在天之靈，也可以吿慰了。</p>

<h3>汪主席對日記者　暢談時局意見</h3>
<p>（南京二十日特電）朝日新聞社東亞部次長和田，及上海總局次長宮崎二氏，二十八日午後五時赴主席官邸謁見國民政府在主席。恭聆對目前諸問題的意見，歷時約一小時許。在主席在會見中，關於世界戰局的動向，指稱英美雅　信他們所誇口的生產力，試欲反攻，但軸心方面之絕對不敗的姿態，則毫無動搖，任何困難，不足恐懼。自參戰以後，因新政策的展開，重慶方面起了深刻的動搖。蔣政權崩潰的前提，當在於國府本身的强化。國府正傾其全力以確保治安與增强生產。隨着新國民運動之强有力的展開，共同担當完遂大東亞戰爭的責務。在主席談話的要旨如次：</p>
<p>世界戰局的動向</p>
<p>美國常宣傳其生產力的優勢，以爲賴此可以進行反攻。但從大東亞戰爭的觀點看來，美國的生產力，毫不足恐。他們所說的反攻，如其眞想實行的話，要渡過遼　的太平洋先就不可能。而且他們還必須一個個奪囘大平洋中無數的鳥喚，故他們無論有怎樣的生產力，也　然沒有把握。大東亞戰爭勃發以來，已一年有半，友邦日本確保偉大的戰果，擊破敵人的反攻，並常取攻勢，大東亞的防衛，有金場之固，感謝與敬意之念，不禁油然而生。</p>
<p>古諺有云：『以逸待勞』，美國如果前來反攻，勞逸之勢，先已判然，勝負不待着卜。爲呼應日本在前綫的奪鬥，中國應傾其所有的力量，使無後顧之憂。蘇聯最近發表解散國際共產黨，可說是捨其名而取其實的一種手段。和蔣介石的關係，不致於因此好轉。</p>
<p>重慶方面的動搖</p>
<p>一月九日以來，賴日本非常的援助，國府之自主的禇施策正在積極進展，和平地區的民衆，尤其是知識階級，對東亞的將來，似已懷有堅定的信念和希望。上海的經濟人，在以前一向不想出山，隨着國府新施策的展開，他們將眞正的和國府協力。反之，重慶方面的動搖則止在加甚中，最近蔣介石直系軍隊的大批來歸，即此事實的表現。觀測重慶方面動搖的內幕，可分爲二類：一類以爲日本的援助國府是中日問合作之眞正的具體化的道路，因而對目前的抗戰抱着疑義；另一類是無定見的分子，他們以爲英·美·蘇聯的團結漸見强固，因而自以依附英美方面爲有利。但他們對此均無準確的預料。這二種矛盾的想法，常起混亂而動搖，要把這重慶方面的動搖誘致於崩壞，祇有强化和平地區的本身。我確信這是處理重慶的根本。</p>
<p>東亞軸心的團結</p>
<p>我曾訪問日本二三次，又曾訪問滿洲國，每次都覺得東亞民族的團結一天天强固起來。東亞的將來，有無限的滿足。日本和中國發生關係已有二千年之久，但中日間糾紛之發生僅五十年前的事，再由此上溯起來，距今一百年前，英·美·俄已經開始侵咯中國，英國渡海從南而來，俄國則取降路從北而來，日本和中國同樣首當侵略之衝。明治維新爲國父孫文誕生之年，如其中國和日本同樣把國內整頓好，而打倒英美，則中日間不致發生糾紛，妨碍中國統一的抗戰分子，應矩道在對日本懷着差誤的仇恨之前，中國自身也有責任。就從現在說來，中日兩國可說同在英美的大包圍下，假使英美勝利，則東亞就將滅亡。中日的同生共死，及我自己的思想，實即在此點。（翔：　自五月三十日實京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>南美僅有之中立國　阿根廷前日發生政變　拉米雷茲已率軍進據京城　卡斯蒂洛總統乘砲艦出亡</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據英·美所傳消息，阿根廷已發生革命。據云革命運動之主要原因，係反對卡斯蒂洛政府之中立政策，有數個軍團亦已參加叛樂。又據路透社蒙特維多消息，總統於叛黨進城後，即決定離京，現乘阿根廷砲艦特魯蒙號出海逃亡。又關前陸軍部長多納茲將軍及另一羅森將軍，皆已贊助叛黨，據云，羅森將軍係同情民主國者，叛亂似係在距京城十五哩之美奧地方發動，羅森將軍耶係自該地領八千之衆向京城前進。據聯合新聞社稱，京城之防軍已與叛黨在郊外衝突。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據路透社阿根廷京城電傳，阿根廷革侖軍司令官拉米雷茲將軍於四日起事後，同時向總統卡斯蒂洛提出四項要求：（一）變更阿根廷中立政策。（二）美洲各國協力。（三）選舉自由。（四）整飭訶根廷政界。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據悉，阿根廷總統卡斯蒂洛於四日革命爆發之時，耶任命馬貴茲將軍爲討伐軍總司令，現馬貴茲將軍正指揮討伐軍事中，又傳並已任命海長芬卡蒂少將繼拉米雷茲爲國防部長。據另訊，卡期蒂洛已偕閣僚乘特魯蒙號掃海艇離開阿京，其後並傳已抵阿根廷京城對岸烏拉主國境之科羅尼亞。又前傳參加革命之阿根廷海軍，其大部人員亦已投入拉米雷茲將軍指揮之革命軍內。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　德國新聞社引蒙特維多消息稱，阿根廷叛黨領袖陸軍部長拉米雷茲宜布，革命之目的乃欲肅淸阿根廷之政治及行政，並答尤尊重規定與其他美訓共和國合作之一切國際條約。並向卡斯蒂洛總統提出最後通牒，此無非欲對美國採取更友好之態度，南美國家中依舊維持中立政策者，僅阿根廷一國而已。總統接獲最後通牒，即下令委任馬貴茲將軍爲討逆軍司令，敉平叛逆，而羅森將軍即率所都七千餘人起事，自美奧出發，向京城前進。又據路透社稱，叛黨又要求科斯達退出總統競選，科斯達爲極右派政客，係由卡斯蒂洛總統提出爲總統候選人者。其後路透社又自烏拉圭京城發出消息謂，卡斯蒂洛總統並未辭職即已登特魯蒙號軍艦，政府軍與叛軍曾在奧立夫方塲發生激戰。據聞空軍亦贊助拉米雷茲將軍，但並未參加起事，海軍則無動靜。據紐約接獲另一蒙特維多消息，卡斯蒂洛總統在廣播中宣稱，阿根廷政府已設立在一軍艦上，渠云，政府係在叛黨進入京城時遷至船上。路透社昨晚自蒙特維多報稱，叛軍己於昨日下午佔領京城內之政府官署，而紐約所接之阿京消息則謂，晚報已發特刋，以「革命成功」爲標題，據紐約所接獲阿京消息謂，昨日已組成一臨時立法會議，由拉米雷茲將軍爲主席，接收卡斯蒂洛總統之政府。</p>
<p>阿京電台宣布　已組臨時政府</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　阿京無綫電台，昨晚廣播阿國革命首領羅森將軍之宣言，謂已得軍隊之擁護，組織一臨時政府，並謂渠已接收陸軍一切事務，仰阿國人民一致信仰新政府。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據阿根廷京城來電，阿根廷革命軍佔領京城後，耶於四日成立行政委員會，該會實權操之於羅森將軍，第一師團長巴希將軍與國防部長拉米內斯三人之手。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　今日此間觀察家表示意見，認爲阿根廷此次推翻現政府之革命運動，幕後似有美國陰謀操縱其間，並指出革命領袖拉米雷茲將軍表示贊成與美合作，及革命份子開入京城時，曾高呼美國宣傳性之戰爭口號二事以爲佐證。據稱，鑒於此次革命之性質，顯然可見美方　五縱隊之操縱，俾使阿根廷放棄其中立政策，更可證明美國之政策，係欲使其勢力所達到之各國，均捲入目前戰爭之　渦。據華盛頓最近消息，美國曾積極考慮一種封鎖辦法，以迫使此唯一保守中立之拉丁美洲國家加入反軸心方面，同時美方又不斷以高壓力之宣傳加　阿根廷。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據華府消息，華府官方指稱，美政府將無疑地承認新阿根廷政府，半官方面則宣稱，阿國行將加入反軸心國陣營，而與軸心國絕交，加入戰爭。</p>
<h3>中滿泰武官發表　教室爪哇感想</h3>
<p>爪加爾達五日中央社電　中滿泰三國武官視察團一行，於二日到達此間，　赴各地視察後，四日聯合發表視察爪哇感想，大意調：日軍佔領爪哇，獲得豐富資源，對於完成戰爭，實有極大意義。吾人視察爪哇第一感想，即東亞人之爪哇，現已復歸東亞人，故爲東亞之共榮計，吾人同生共死之決意，於茲益堅。吾等曾視察加里爪池激戰遺蹟，對於日本以極短時間，奪獲如此重要基地之偉績，實深感佩。吾人又曾視察爪加爾達，萬隆·泗水等市，見住民之明朗生活，已明瞭日憲兵與住民間和愛緊密之關係，爪哇華僑已迴異戰前，而脫却敵人主義，協力日軍，因軍政當局之努力，爪哇已形成共榮圈之有力甚地，深感未來之爪哇，必將爲大東亞之樂園。</p>
<h3>北非洲海岸附近　義魚雷機隊活躍　六日中擊沉敵船六萬噸　潘蒂萊里亞島防務鞏固</h3>
<p>羅馬五日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，義方魚雷根　近在非洲海岸附近襲擊敵方海上交通，於六夜之間擊沉敵船六萬噸之多。敵方雖以張大武力保護船隻及襲擊地點之接近敵方基地，但義機仍繼續此項困難任務毫無懈怠。</p>
<p>羅馬五日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，六月一日羲屬潘蒂萊里亞島曾遭英驅逐艦四艘之初次轟擊，其經過情形如下：一日傍晚六時許，敵海軍一隊，計驅逐艦四艘發現於該島之北海岸，並立即開火，向岸上轟擊，海岸砲位即予還擊，雙方互轟數發後，義方砲位命中敵艦一艘，該艦負創即向西駛去，艦上已見起火，其餘三艦亦停止作戰，藉烟幕掩護向馬爾太逸去。現悉義海岸砲位予敵人以損失後，敵艦均已撤離該島附近，島上之砲位曾擊毀敵機多架。按潘蒂萊里亞島現已成爲義大利防務之第一道屏陣，島上之守軍與居民，對於英美之攻擊毫無恐懼，且更密切聯絡，以準備應付萬一之事變。</p>
<p>羅馬五日中央社電　此間入士評述潘蒂萊里亞島抵抗反軸心海空軍攻勢之前　時，均認爲該島地勢優良，防務極爲鞏固，蓋其港口異常狹小，即最小之軍艦亦難開入。該島之飛行港，亦非熟悉當地形勢者不能降陸，全島多爲山地，欲從事軍事活動，自更非明瞭途徑不可，故該島之防軍多由當地居民中召慕，全島居民約爲萬人。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據社會民生報駐倫敦訪員電稱，倫敦對於犯歐之說，已大爲減少，目下所對論者，大半集中於侵犯地中海之潘蒂萊里亞小島，而非歐洲。英國軍事觀察家威信，該島經海空軍之攻擊或可使其陷於孤立無援，而喪失其及攻之可能性，此外更須儘早進攻該島附近之囊籌里諾沙　蘭披杜沙兩島。</p>
<h3>阿圖島一役　美軍傷亡六千</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　美海軍部對於阿　島美軍傷亡數目，仍一如問例，作虛假發表，初謂美軍僅傷亡六百人，但至四日又謂傷亡共違一千五百卅五人，是所發表者，前後極爲矛盾，故已不復爲其國民所信任，良以美國國民於接獲日本大本營發表消息以後，即已知阿圖島美軍傷亡實達六千人之多，紐約泰晤士報曾批評謂，此次發表顯圖將損害作過小評價，此實爲一虛僞之正式聲明。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　據華鹽頓來電，美陸長史汀生發表，自開戰以來，美軍將士被俘總數已達七八〇八三人，其中一一三〇七人係被日軍所俘。</p>
<h3>東歐前綫情形緊張　各路大戰將爆發　庫班河口決戰德軍獲勝</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據路透社駐莫斯科特派員電稱，各方前綫預料即有大戰爆發，故情形頗爲緊張，唐納資前綫之里西强斯克區域，全日砲聲隆隆，預料德軍即將大舉進攻。諾伏羅西斯東北之古班區域內，蘇軍仍壓迫德軍防綫，惟爲狹小之山隘及山谷所限制，未能展開大軍。德空軍仍繼續猛轟東綫之蘇軍交通綫供應根據地。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　據東綫消息，庫班河口地區之第三次決戰，自五月三十一日展開以來，經數日之激戰，至本月三日，似已在德軍之絕對優勢之下吿一段落。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾抵倫敦</h3>
<p>里期本五日中央社電　據倫敦消息，英首相邱吉爾，上週自華府啓程返回，途經阿爾及爾與突尼斯，今晨返抵倫敦，外相艾登與總參謀長勃羅克隨行，艾登於阿爾及爾加久首相一行，在被處曾聯袂拜訪北非美聯軍總司令埃森霍華，並言與特戈爾及季勞曁新法國民族解放委員會會員晤商，然後前往突尼斯檢閱反軸心軍隊。按邱吉爾一週前由美飛往直布羅陀，然後直赴阿爾及爾與艾登會面，路透社稱，二氏並未參與特戈爾·季勞二人之談話。</p>
<h3>美新任太平洋　潛艇隊司令</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　美京電訊，昨日美海軍部公布，海軍少將洛克伍特已被任爲太平洋美潛艇隊司令。原任此職之殷格里許少將，數月前在太平洋殞命，故由洛克伍特繼任。</p>
<h3>日大使赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>庫比希夫五日中央社電　日本駐蘇大使佐藤尙武偕同大使館一等秘書竹內及其他館員五人，昨乘飛機往莫斯科。</p>
<h3>保加利亞近況</h3>
<p>（蘇斐亞梅田特派員二十八日發）保加利亞人被稱爲「巴爾幹的日本人」，近來因地中海情勢的緊迫，巴爾幹半島戰雲密佈，故也顯得緊張起來了。衣這樣重大的時期中，自本年二月中旬以來，迄最近止。全國各地的恐怖事件類有發生，在國民的心理上投下了沉重的陰影。犧牲的名單中，有被奪敬爲編組保軍之父的柳果夫斯大將，前蘇斐亞警察長官蓬條特大尉，及議會外交委員長耶納夫氏等。首都蘇斐亞最近曾舉行二次大檢舉，潛伏中的犯人被檢舉者達數十名，結果，某種畸殺案件係出於第三國際之指令，其他則由於英國秘密偵探局之策助，眞相於以大白。又秘密無綫電臺之被檢舉的，有蘇斐亞的向西亞及向蘇聯的秘密無綫電臺，又在蘇斐亞及伊斯坦因布爾之間商業都市菲利波波利的向西亞電臺『及在黑海互爾那港向蘇聯的無被電臺等數處。而最爲特別者。在犯人中，不僅有猶太人六名直接與恐怖行爲有關係，其中且有二名是暗殺的眞犯人，因此，政府鼓近對全體猶太人採取相常嚴厲的擔置，多島海沿岸托拉基亞，刺洛尼問背後之瑪開特尼亞等戰略上重要地帶的猶太人一萬三千名，在本年三月移住於波關。這些巴爾幹的猶太人，和其他諸國的猶太人不同，　有露骨的挑戰性格。保加利亞最近這種　擾的情勢，固由於英美及蘇聯各從其不同的見地從事秘密工作，想掌握這通向西亞方面的門戶。英美方面想用這所恐怖行爲使保加利亞陷於無政府狀態，並想使訓練有素的保軍和軸心軍脫離關係。</p>
<p>而且這不僅在保加利亞，即在希臘，塞爾維亞　達爾瑪地亞等地帶現在亦有英美的這種策動，尤以亞得里亞海岸一帶，由武裝團體實行恐怖行爲。保國的軍事專家曾作警吿稱；「注意亞得里亞海！」蘇聯的想法，和英美想把巴爾幹從德國切離的方法不同。蘇聯企圖把保加利亞，羅馬尼亞　南斯拉夫，希臘收人蘇聯的勢力範圍，結成巴爾幹聯邦。在塞實維亞·羣的納哥羅·阿爾巴尼亞的一部及希臘等地，蘇聯有相當的勢力，對抗英美方面的武裝關體，以壓迫英美在此方面的活動。</p>
<p>因此，英美與蘇聯在蘇斐亞所展開的對巴爾幹對策及協力，非但不見調和，反而互相猜忌，存在着不可輸越的鴻溝。</p>
<p>蘇聯結成巴爾幹聯邦的目的，在求從韃靼尼爾海峽出地中海的出口，一貫地繼承着帝俄時代的計劃。德蘇戰前，蘇聯外相莫洛托夫訪問柏林時，聲稱：第一，蘇聯在羅馮尼亞及保加利亞海岸建築蘇聯根據地。第二，要求將韃日尼爾海峽由蘇聯管理。之後，莫洛托夫外相之代理者波卓姆金訪問保加利亞時亦曾透露同樣要求。</p>
<p>這蘇聯對巴爾幹的基本政策，對土耳其有很大的威脅。遠非保，羅諸國所感到的威脅所可比擬。保，羅及其他諸國之參加德義，想由此以獲致公平的新秩序之保障及務望。土耳其因在巴爾幹的一角佔有領土的關係，故擬賴英美的保障以減與蘇聯的威脅。成爲問題者，英美果能對土耳其給與這種保障嗎？</p>
<p>駐屯於伊朗，伊拉克的英第九第十軍，組織不良，第一軍第八軍則甫從突尼西亞戰終歸來，困頓疲弊，需要長期間的休養。二者都有增强及改編的必要，且其時間亦必相當悠長。土耳其有鑒於此，至少將在本年十月底之前仍堅持嚴正中立，沉着地　察足以支配本身命還的德蘇戰爭之動向，希望德國勝利，如此，則西亞可永遠處於等英的均勢下。上述的暗殺恐怖行爲，就是反軸心方面在此情勢下所實行的苦肉計。英美更爲了使這恐怖行爲成爲一種有效的政治牽制策略起見利用猶大人實施各種宣傳，使巴爾幹一般人民，感受一種戰爭即將在巴爾幹　發，或巴爾幹諸部市即將遭過大轟炸的印象。但從德義最高首腦部直接間接與保加利亞國王鮑理期三世及其他巴爾幹諸國元首會見的情勢看來，三千五百萬國民已結成了對一切敵性國家侵略的巴爾幹防衛陣。而且保軍雖尙未參加實際戰事，但在過去業已累積了很多經騐，其軍隊的組織亦適於近代戰爭。因此，立於巴爾幹防衛陣第一綫的保加利亞，參加爲軸心同盟軍的一員，即將在東南歐扮演重要的角色。（翔：譯自五月卅一日國部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>短評　「節省宴會公約」</h3>
<p>我們曾經屢次提出過實踐戰時生活，首先要節約消費，而宴會一項，尤其是消費中比較最糜費的一種。大家爲了「喜慶」，爲了「叙情」，爲了「議事」等等，都用宴會的方式表示聯歡與聚談。這在人生與友情上講，原是未可厚非的。但是，在大都市裏，因爲物質享受的便利，就漸漸流入於過分奢糜的舖張塲面，簡直是暴殄物質了。我們一貪災區同胞，前綫將士，以及窮苦大眾的「無食」「無飽」，心裏總覺不忍。因此，我們想建議和倡導一個「節省宴會公約」，凡自做主人宴會時，就須遵守這公約的規定，完全用「守信」的精神自動實踐。這公約的內容大致包括以下各點：</p>
<p>（一）不用洋酒。用酒有限度。</p>
<p>（二）不用魚翅，燕窩。</p>
<p>（三）不備香烟。</p>
<p>（四）不徵歌妓。</p>
<p>（五）指定菜館中最低代價的筵席。</p>
<p>（六）配菜數量，以吃飽，吃完，不糟蹋爲度。</p>
<p>（七）宴會時間，不超過兩小時。</p>
<p>（八）賓客之車夫，飯錢自備。</p>
<p>以上僅就一時想到者列舉。請讀者發表意見補充訂正。如承同意參加，請列明姓氏職業，函寄本報隨時公布台銜，共同督促，共同遵守。</p>
<p>更以節約之資，捐助華北賑款，捐充各種善舉，提供政府作國民獻金。</p>

<h3>體育　滬連對抗運動會　滬預選　今日下午舉行</h3>

<h3>經濟界　小言論　商業利潤與大眾生活</h3>
<p>限制利潤，爲統制經濟主義所要求的一個條件；安定民生，爲戰時經濟政策所要求的一個條件。因此，上述兩種條件的配合，乃有其絕對的必要性。蓋限制商人利潤，即所以抑平物品價格，抑平物品價格，即所以安定人民生活。這是十二分顯明的。</p>
<p>此次美國全國五十餘萬煤礦罷工工人所釀成的嚴重形勢，不得不使我們追源其故。原來，美國煤礦工人所要求者，爲較優的生活待遇，但其結果，則爲礦主對於煤價的提高，以致直接影響各種工業的成本，間接提高各種商品的價格，而礦工所獲得者，則僅爲名義上的工資增加，因爲物價，由於礦主提高煤價，增加得比工資更大；展轉下來的結果，乃有些次一發不可收拾的嚴重罷工風潮。</p>
<p>由於這樣一個「殷鑒」，我們愈覺在戰時人民生活艱難的處境中，限制商業利潤，誠爲值得深加考慮的一個重要問題。成本較低的工商業利潤，固應有其限制，大規模經營的工商業利潤，尤應有其限制；所謂大規模者，自指若干獨占性質，或爲供應軍事需要，或爲調劑商塲供需。因爲工商業經營的規模愈大，其一舉一措之足以影響日常用品的價格者亦愈大。</p>
<p>總之一句話，正當的工商界，應以「國民經濟」，「大眾生活」，爲其經營的前提，不當以「利潤」爲其先決條件，因爲，商業利潤合理化，物價亦方能合理化。</p>
<h3>各行商端節結帳　銀錢業信用鞏固　農產品貸款儘量予以通融</h3>

<p>市塲金融</p>
<p>各行莊因端節關係，收解特別繁忙，票據交換額激增，市塲金融因銀錢業準備會庫，以及中央儲備銀行緊縮貸款，銀根較以往爲緊。惟各業正當需要，如收買春繭小麥菜籽等放款則儘量予以通融，旨在復興農村經濟。</p>
<h3>華北政委會　規定糧食價格</h3>
<p>（北京五日中央社電）華北政委會公布，茲誌於後：（鐵路沿綫附近一百公斤價格）：小麥一六五元，小米一三九元，玉米一二九元，高粱一〇九元。又此項價格決自六月二十一日起，在全華北同時實施。對違反此項價格而爲買賣時，除沒收買方購入之食糧及賣方超過之利益外，並予以嚴懲，但蘇淮地區之物價，很根據此項價格再參酌該地市價另行決定。又山西地區因具有特殊之經濟關係，故亦得以該地採運社爲中心，另行規定此項規定價格，目下乃適用於在重魯豫三省各地區。</p>

<h3>華股消息</h3>
<p>萎疲多日之華股，昨忽現露鋒芒，各方人心看好，投資者趁在假前搜買愈切。新藥業中之中法藥房承前日昂勢續升猶勁，已見空前新高價；新亞藥廠隨升元許，買風亦起。百貨業所升仍微，永安·新新·國貨三公司各好起數元；中國內衣微升，景福衫襪首躍起元訐。紡織業亦爲買戶所垂青，永安紡織突叩大關，信孚印染亦見做高。南洋烟公司堅定；大中華火柴仍帶遜色。閘北水電·華商電氣與公信電器等中股亦在同上進展中。文化業中華書局回升近大關；世界呆平；商務書館成交價反見低落。此外各雜色股，久安實業·通易信託，趨勢堅挺；新益地產·中興木業亦求過於供。</p>

<h3>拋出囤貨限期已過　物資調查進入緊張階段</h3>
<p>關於調查牽涉囤積事件之軍配組合，業經大使館明確發表。復由物資調查委員會陳兼委員長公博發表談話，目下各方對於澈查囤積，極表關心，而指定在六月二日以前拋出囤貨之限期，亦已過去，故預料當局即將召開首次物資調查委員會。</p>
<p>按五月十三日，最高國防會議上通過物資調查委員會組織大綱，迄已二旬有餘，在此二十日中，其調查方針要綱，亦已擬定，並聞各調查官之名單，亦經內定，則不久舉行首次委員會時，必能積極着手處理囤積問題。</p>
<p>五月三日公佈之囤積主要商品治罪條例，第八條上明定在施行條例之前如囤有物資之非主要商品同業公會會員，應自條例施行日起，在一個月內向主管官署報告，以限價售與同業公會，又在第九條上規定在施行條例之前，如囤有物資之主要商品同業公會會員，應自條例施行日起，在一個月內向主管官署補行登記。</p>
<p>按期限期，已於六月二日期滿，故眾認物資調查委員會將以六月二日以前登記者爲基礎，開始調查工作，處理囤積問題，已離開準備期間而到達開始全面調查之階段。（雲鵬：譯自六月五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>當局決取締　非公會會員行號</h3>
<p>本市各業公會遵奉當局意旨，爲適應戰事體制，强化機構，均已分別調整訓緒，辦理會員登記，各業正當商號均須入會，以維業務。據悉目下各業公會對會員入會登記積極辦理，限期截止，以期整理彙報當局審核，至於不入會或經審核不合作之商店，當局將予取締，並令銀錢業各行莊不予往來，以維法令。</p>
<h3>大眾生活　公務人員的生活</h3>
<p>— 陳理卿</p>
<p>銀行員及郵務員生活，我先後在本欄讀過，百物騰貴的今日，確實是難於過活，但是在任職政府的公務員，生活待遇更比銀行郵員及務員清苦得多，因爲公務員的待遇，受資格的約束，和命令的規定，還是根據民國二十二年九月二十三日公布二十五年九月二十三日修正的「暫行文官等俸表」發放。</p>
<p>官俸表的規定，委任級由是六級至一級，薪額由五十五元至二百元，每一政府機關任用的職員，委任三四五年級爲最多，月薪五級爲一百三十元，四級爲一百四十元，五級爲一百六十元，亦可以說，上列的數額，是一般公務人員薪給的大眾化標準。雖然政府當局爲使公務員安心服務起見，於三十年十一月及十二月份起，通令所屬機關加發二次八成的臨時津貼，凡月薪一百六十元者，可支十六成臨時津貼計二百五十六元，共得四百十六元，一百四十元者薪津共得三百六十四元，一百三十元者薪津共得三百三十八元，餘可類推，但是支一百六十元底薪的職員，職位已經是在「股長」或「主任課員」的等級了。公務人員的操守，雖貪汚廉潔不一，但「清者自清，濁者自濁」。要是清濁對照的比較，還是清者來得多，濁者來得少，不過話要說回來的，公務員的待遇是這樣低，生活程度這麼高，清者並非自己不喜歡錢，大槪有別種顧忌而不願自濁者，居多而已。</p>
<p>查民國十七年以前軍國時代，經辦厘卡的職員，月薪大部份祇有六元，可是每月伙食要去七元，俸金所入，吃飯也不夠，所以職員　　百出，後來國軍南來，裁厘加稅之，對於公務員的待遇，也相當予以改善，生活獲得調劑，舞弊自然減殺了，我打量現在公務員的待遇來支配現實的生活，實在又有步入民國十七年以前的時代的可能，就想：公務員不供膳宿，現在包飯以月計，每餐每客不是要近二百元麼？早中夜三餐併算，一個人光是吃飯也要化費到五百元之多，依照文官官等俸給表薪額，再加二次臨時加成津貼的話，除非支薦任級底薪加算，那纔夠一個人自己「吃飯」眞是困難極了。</p>
<p>約二個月以前，在報紙上讀到政府當局的建議，對於公務人員的生活，又在設法改善，日用品計劃配給，我們充任公務人員的，那個不希望這計劃成功？還期望着從速促之實現，俾得早早減少我們公務人員生活熬煎的苦痛。</p>

<h3>From Political Lies to Opium Suppression</h3>
<p>— Chen Fumu</p>
<p>The baseness of politics lies greater than lying. The evil of Chinese politics lies in the fact that those in power know only how to lie to the people, and never think about how to genuinely implement political reform. Three years ago, when the National Government returned to its capital, Chairman Wang once proposed a slogan: "Tell the truth, take responsibility." I feel that if a government can rarely gain the support of the people, it doesn't need to come up with grand plans or promote some profound and unpredictable political programs and doctrines. It only needs to sincerely and practically make the determination to "eliminate evil completely and follow good as a stream," for the sake of the country and the people, do one thing at a time, be able to say it and be able to do it, not tell lies, not do false things, and let the people know that this government is truly "beneficial and eliminates abuses" and is sufficient to do good. Then, if this government has even more grand plans and political programs, the people will not only believe it, but will also be encouraged and inspired to follow it.</p>
<p>Examples of political lies in China are more than ten thousand, and cannot be exhausted. I now want to cite a most base and shameless political lie, which is the so-called "opium suppression." The harm of opium is enough to destroy the race and the country, which is a truth known to women and children, and I don't need to waste words to describe it. The Chinese government has been promoting opium suppression for more than a hundred years, and not only has opium not been eradicated, but it has become even more rampant, with new tricks being invented. The government uses this to raise funds, and officials rely on this to make money. It is called opium suppression, but in reality it is promoting opium, fearing that the people will know its poison and not smoke more. It even cleverly creates names, clearly opium drugs, but beautifully calls them "opium cessation ointment." Clearly a smoking room, but calls it a "opium cessation room." Clearly the place where the crime of selling opium is located, but calls it a "opium cessation center." Taking this "opium cessation ointment" as an example, expanding on it, lying and deceiving people in politics, corruption is integrity, treason is patriotism, extortion is relief, and perverting the law is abiding by the law. All kinds of evils can be given beautiful names to deceive the world. The so-called political credibility, national laws, and discipline are all empty words. During the rule of the Northern Warlords, it was dark and lawless, and there is no need to talk about what tricks they played to satisfy their political sins. More than ten years ago, the Kuomintang rose to power with a revolutionary new attitude, but invented this shameless name to sell opium without correction, and the media also found it strange and no one criticized it, which is truly heartbreaking. However, the people spread the word, "The revolutionaries say all the good words and do all the bad things," and this "opium cessation ointment" may be one of them!</p>
<p>Thinking back to when the National Government was first established in 1925, the revolutionary atmosphere was flourishing, and there was a new atmosphere in all aspects of governance. Mr. Liao Zhongkai was the Minister of Finance, and he earnestly discussed his new opium suppression plan with me, and asked me to do my part to promote it in the newspapers when the plan was implemented. He had a very valuable saying, he said: "Some people think that genuine opium suppression will hinder fiscal revenue, but I believe that the more genuine the opium suppression, the more ways there will be to manage finances." Unfortunately, this Kuomintang leader and the most courageous practical statesman was assassinated by thugs a few days after he drafted the genuine opium suppression plan. From then on, the Kuomintang regime gradually fell into the hands of some people with hooligan consciousness, foreign slave consciousness, and those "silver lice," who only knew the preciousness of power and wealth, and had little sense of justice. And the eulogy of "The revolutionaries say all the good words and do all the bad things" was sung from the mouths of the people.</p>
<p>I also have a historical fact, which is that in the summer of 1926, Song Ziwen was the Minister of Finance, widely selling opium and favoring people with opium addiction to run the finances, which was clearly contrary to the policies of the National Government at that time. (The National Government ordered that no one who smokes opium should be employed as a civil servant in any agency.) At that time, I was a member of the Control Yuan and impeached Song Ziwen to the National Government. Chiang Kai-shek ordered Mr. Li Zhangda, my fellow villager who was the director of the Public Security Bureau at the time, to come and talk to me, saying that now the Northern Expeditionary Army was about to set out, and impeaching Song Ziwen would shake the finances, which would be equivalent to hindering the great plan of the Northern Expedition. He asked me to withdraw the official document. I replied to him: "It is my duty to impeach officials who violate the policies of the party and the government, and the Commander-in-Chief has no right to interfere. As for shaking the finances and hindering the Northern Expedition, I do not admit it. If it is necessary to violate the policies of the party and the government to carry out the Northern Expedition, then it is better not to carry out the Northern Expedition." At that time, Mr. Tan Yankai was the acting chairman of the National Government, and he also said to me: "Chiang is very unhappy about that impeachment case, and the National Government cannot approve it, so it is better to withdraw it temporarily." I replied to him: "It is the chairman's duty to approve or not approve, and it is my duty to impeach officials for violating the law. I cannot abandon my duty and withdraw the impeachment case." The National Government never approved that case, and the hateful and shameful lie of "opium cessation ointment" has been blindly telling until now. It is said that in recent years, some local tricks have become even more wonderful, naming the organization that sells opium as "Benevolent Hall," which is truly benevolent! Benevolent! Nothing can be added.</p>
<p>There are two most unpromising things for people in Chinese politics: First, it is unpromising to do things and want to gain a good name. In fact, politics cannot escape the two sides of good and evil. Doing things always requires having shoulders, a conscience, and the ability to act, being worthy of the country and the people, why bother to steal a good name to cover up everything. Like the political hypocrisy and lying in recent years, it is really embarrassing to hear. For example, collecting gambling taxes is euphemistically called "defense expenses," issuing lottery tickets is euphemistically called "charity," and collecting donations from prostitutes is euphemistically called "education expenses," making the hard study of students associated with the prostitution of prostitutes, which is even more unbearable. In fact, if the government has shoulders, responsibility, and courage, then gambling donations and prostitution losses can be like other tax revenues, planned and used properly, then there is no need to take some boring good names to cover up shame. If every political event has to think of a good and beautiful name, then why not change the prison to "Paradise" and the executioner to "Send Wang Po," wouldn't that be the biggest joke in the world. Second, it is unpromising to persuade people every day to follow the example of sages and admire heroes, but have no courage to be sages and heroes themselves. Taking opium suppression as an example, people in the government talk about opium suppression and talk about Lin Zexu, but I don't understand why the people who hold power don't think about being the second Lin Zexu themselves, and only praise Lin Zexu there? In the era of Lin Zexu, opium suppression was difficult because the government was in a dark age and diplomatic politics were muddled. It was difficult for one person to be the first to advocate it. At present, opium suppression is a household name, the government has a clear order, and there are no foreigners hindering it, then the mayor of every city and the magistrate of a certain county can be Lin Zexu in their jurisdiction. But for more than a hundred years, it seems that there is only one Lin Zexu for us to admire, this country is really a bit pitiful!</p>
<p>Whether the government has action and the determination to do good to the people does not lie in issuing long ten-thousand-word declarations, or in those great and profound programs with outlines and items. Just start from small places. Look at whether those small and easy things have been practiced and improved. Small and easy things are still unwilling to do, or even lazy to do, then there is no need to ask about other things. When we leave the concession and go to Nanshi, or along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to various cities all the way to Nanjing, almost every city and town, every neighborhood has a "opium cessation room" or "opium cessation center." If a foreigner who does not understand the situation in China sees it, how will they praise the thoroughness of China's opium suppression administration? They will never think of how unbearable the content is.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that no government should use good names to do evil things. The government must be frank and determined. Only caring about raising funds and not paying attention to the fundamental disasters of the country and the nation is already wrong. Tolerating people to smoke opium and calling it opium cessation is even more wrong. The current National Government that "tells the truth and takes responsibility" must make it clear that it does not tell political lies, and fundamentally reforms the current opium suppression system. The first easy thing to do is to strictly prohibit these shameful and despicable terms such as "opium cessation ointment." Opium must be clearly written as "opium poison ointment," the opium selling room should be called "opium poison selling place," and the merchant should be called "merchant selling opium poison smoke," so that smokers can understand the meaning of the name, and traffickers can know shame when they see the name. This does not shake the finances, (genuine opium suppression actually helps finances, which is beyond the scope of this article, so I will not go into details) but it eliminates the stain of telling lies and shows that the government tells the truth and takes responsibility. I hope that the government will not fail to do it because it is a small matter.</p>
<h3>How to Increase Industrial Production</h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an</p>
<p>In the past, places like Shanghai were filled with floating capital, and everyone coveted immediate gains, flocking to the path of hoarding materials, which led to a sharp rise in prices. On the surface, it became a deformed prosperity, but in reality, it was strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and social life became increasingly difficult. Some blame it on the floating capital, but the floating capital is not used properly, and the floating capital has not entered the right path. Misusing floating capital is the fault of society, and the floating capital itself is not to blame. Now, changing course, the investment of our people should change the past trend and strive to increase production, in order to complete the task of wartime economy, which has become the unanimous goal of the people of the country. How to increase production? It is definitely not something that can be completed by one aspect. The whole country should be mobilized, and consistent efforts should be made from many aspects in order to achieve its goal. Therefore, based on what I have seen and heard, I will briefly describe its outline, in order to correct it with the gentlemen of the country.</p>
<p>First, I hope from the Japanese authorities that China's production is backward, and its industry is immature. Japan is an advanced industrial country, and it is worthy of China's learning in every way. It is its responsibility to support and assist. At this time when the difficulties of China's production sector have reached their peak, I hope that the Japanese authorities will provide convenience to Chinese producers everywhere. All raw materials supply, machinery transportation, and technology transfer, economic accommodation, all that is within their power, should be assisted as much as possible to solve difficulties. If the inland production sector still feels a lot of pain, it seems appropriate to thoroughly investigate, strictly ban, and eliminate the past habits of humiliation and encroachment. At the same time, since the Japanese business community has called for coexistence and co-prosperity, it should also embrace the meaning of equal distribution of benefits, eliminate selfish opinions, and cooperate sincerely, so that the lifeline of China's production sector will not be frequently extinguished, this is one.</p>
<p>Second, I hope from our government that the government authorities have put forward increasing production as the main principle of the current nation-building. Recently, they have been wary of the misuse of investment methods in the business community, and deeply know that there is no other way to save the country than increasing production. The key to increasing production is to benefit the people, not to harm the people. If the policies that harm the people are not eliminated, and the effects of benefiting the people are not seen, China's production sector will only become increasingly depressed, and all will perish. At present, the saying of material exchange has been very noisy, but it is as difficult as ascending to heaven to transport raw materials from place A to place B, and the bad habits of difficulty at every turn and layer-by-layer exploitation are probably not completely eliminated. It is even more difficult to make industrial products unobstructed and sell in the interior. The crux of this is, such as the unsound transportation institutions, the non-specialization of tax collection agencies, the incomplete services of financial groups, the insufficient guidance and protection forces of officialdom, and the defects in various man-made aspects, and the disconnection of mutual cooperation, if our government authorities have the determination, they should gradually improve them within the possible range. Relieving the production sector of one point of pain is to increase the strength of the country by one point, and to preserve one point of vitality of the society, which is also the cornerstone of the government's self-reliance in production to save the country, this is two.</p>
<p>Third, I hope from the financial sector that finance is the element of production and the backing of the industrial sector, there is no financial sector that can be more united. The only difficulty in China's industry is the weakness of capital. Only because of its weak capital strength, the large-scale operation of industry is still very lacking. In peacetime, the biggest difficulties are: first, the excessively high interest rate, second, the insufficient assistance from the silver and money industry, and third, the failure to fully popularize mortgage loans and acceptance discounts, and the lack of sincere cooperation between the financial and production sectors is indeed the biggest problem. In the future, financial institutions should not carry out production loans arbitrarily without goals, but should be a sincere cooperation with steps and meaning. In particular, they should concentrate their spiritual strength and devote themselves to several important undertakings, and carry out larger-scale liaison work. Such as the recent silk industry loan syndicate, flour and wheat loan syndicate, and the cotton loan syndicate that is currently under negotiation, all belong to the entire plan, and are worthy of advocacy and support, which is an excellent atmosphere for the transformation of the lending business of today's silver and money industry, extending it to the countryside and agriculture, all of which are waiting for the financial sector to support it from beginning to end, and give it the merit of nourishing and growing. At the same time, I hope that the financial sector will urgently recruit professional talents in the future, and provide technical guidance and improvement to the lending factories. It must be known that it is better to give loans at a low profit, which is of great benefit to the production industry, than to give loans at a high profit, which does not benefit the society and the country. As long as the work is meaningful and contributes, it is worth doing. Furthermore, the Central Reserve Bank, as the bank of banks, should devote all its efforts to production in its future business policy, regardless of directly or indirectly assisting the industrial sector, and should increase production as its only concern, without any evasion. Especially for businesses such as rediscount and transfer mortgage, and the support of production syndicates, all belong to the urgent tasks, and go all out, so as not to fail its due responsibilities, this is three.</p>
<p>Fourth, I hope from the industrial sector itself that the recent trend of capital increase in the industrial sector is popular for a while. On the surface, it is to increase the value of the industry and to increase the profits, but in reality, it is called the value of the industry, but it is formed by the depreciation of the currency value, which results in an increase in assets on the books, and paper wealth cannot be rushed to be optimistic. However, because of this problem, the industrial sector has developed a fluke mentality, only knowing how to study how to increase shares and increase capital after the value of the industry has increased, and how to issue premiums, and all the most important issues of work, technical problems, and all organizational management, etc., have no time to pay attention to, or even disdain to pay attention to. It is said that it seems inevitable to be pedantic and cautious and not adapt to the environment to talk about personnel management, scientific management, and industrial rationalization in today's production sector, which is really a sigh. It is not known that running industry and only knowing the market price, stock price rise and fall, and disdaining to pay attention to technical management, the result is undoubtedly failure. I still remember that in 1933, when I visited the Japanese textile factory, the authorities in the factory said to me: "The Japanese factory manager is buried in the factory all day long, working on technical improvements and management rationalization, while the Chinese factory authorities spend most of their time in the exchange calculating profits and losses, or raising funds and running around the doors of the silver and money industry." It can be said that the authorities of our country's yarn factories at that time did have shortcomings that could not be avoided, and their words can be greatly appreciated, and are a head-on blow to our people. Not only yarn factories are like this, but any factory that is managed must use real effort to work hard in terms of technology and management. Otherwise, after peace, the superior will win and the inferior will be eliminated, and there is no doubt that it will be eliminated. At this time of transition and preparation, there is room for my industrial sector to study and reform. All attention to work experiments, implementation of scientific management, implementation of cost accounting, and facilities for welfare undertakings are all good opportunities to start improving today. If you do not plan for this, it will be too late to regret it. My far-sighted industrial sector will not consider these words to be far-fetched.</p>

<h3>Marshal Yamamoto's State Funeral Solemnly Held in Tokyo Yesterday Morning Imperial Envoy and Japanese Prime Minister Attended the Memorial Service This Afternoon Reburied Next to Marshal Togo's Tomb</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) The state funeral of the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan was solemnly held in Hibiya Park here today. This morning, after holding a memorial service in front of the spirit at Suikosha, where the coffin was placed, the hearse departed at 9:00 am, escorted by many people including the Vice-Chairmen of the State Funeral Committee, Hoshino and Shimada Shigetaro, Suzuki Kantaro, Nagano Osami, Kato Takaaki, Inoue Kenji, Takahashi Sankichi and other naval admirals, as well as Yamada Otozo, the army general, and other prominent military officials. The Marshal's Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, the First Class Order of the Golden Kite and other eleven medals were carried in front by naval officers, followed by army and navy guards of honor. The guards of honor were under the command of General Doihara, and were extremely solemn and powerful, the procession being one kilometer long. At 9:45 am, they arrived at the ceremony site amid the playing of the ceremonial music "Dedication" by the military band. Then, in the presence of various members of the imperial family, royalty, relatives of the late Marshal, Prime Minister Tojo and other prominent officials of the first rank and above, and public envoys from various countries, a memorial service was held. The imperial envoy first paid a memorial visit, followed by the royal family. Royalties. The mourners, Prime Minister Tojo and other prominent officials paid tribute in sequence. When Prime Minister Tojo paid tribute at 10:50 am, the entire nation of Japan silently stood for one minute towards the ceremony site, expressing their condolences. Finally, 22,000 citizens were allowed to enter the ceremony to pay their respects. It was decided that at 2:30 pm, they would depart for Tama Cemetery to hold the funeral. The late Marshal Yamamoto's tomb was built next to the tomb of Marshal Togo, the Japanese naval battle saint who was previously granted a state funeral, which is of great significance. On this day, the whole country of Japan uniformly stopped singing, dancing, music and gatherings, and each household flew the flag at half-mast to express condolences. Where the funeral procession passed, the sidewalks were filled with citizens, and their expressions of grief and respect were overflowing. Also, today, various institutions and schools held mourning ceremonies in the morning, and then continued to have classes and work as usual. The tense situation of working hard with sorrow is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement on the 4th, which said: "Japan, in order to seek survival, had no choice but to declare war on Britain and the United States. After that, Marshal Yamamoto assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and did not fail to live up to His Majesty the Emperor's expectations and Holy Majesty, and closely cooperated with the army to launch large-scale operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, starting with the world-shaking Hawaiian and Malayan naval battles. He defeated enemy troops everywhere and achieved unprecedented glorious results. In this way, under the Holy Majesty, due to the brave and valiant fighting of the Japanese soldiers, in just one and a half years since the start of the war, a strategic posture of certain victory and invincibility has been established. Now that the Greater East Asia War is gradually entering the decisive stage and the war situation is becoming more and more important, at this time, the Marshal commanded the Combined Fleet on the front line, engaged in battle with the enemy in a naval aircraft, and died heroically in the southern sea. He set an example and instructed all the soldiers, which is worthy of being an example for 100 million citizens. Feeling this heroic warrior's heart, we cannot help but burst into tears. The spirit of the Marshal commanding the battle on the front line and dying heroically has made the morale of all the soldiers even more agitated, and the anti-enemy heart of the whole nation is even more strengthened. If our people are discouraged and lose their souls because of the Marshal's death, this is definitely not to comfort the Marshal's spirit. At present, the internal and external situation does not allow for any complacency. Now, the path of my 100 million people is only to take the Marshal's noble spirit as our spirit and the Marshal's great fighting spirit as our fighting spirit. We must move forward towards the destruction of Britain and the United States with a hundred battles and an indomitable heart, so as to reassure the Holy Majesty. The strategic posture of certain victory and invincibility built by the brave fighting of the Japanese army has been established. Regardless of the front or the rear, with the spirit of 100 million people as one, we must do our best to achieve a glorious victory. Here, I express my heartfelt condolences for the Marshal's death. The Marshal's spirit is still there, and I pray for the Marshal's blessings."</p>
<p>Naval Minister Shimada Broadcasts to Show Mourning</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) The 5th was the date of the state funeral for the late Japanese Marshal Yamamoto. Naval Minister Shimada specifically broadcast to the nation from the Central Radio Station here at 7:30 pm on this day to show mourning. The gist of his broadcast is recorded as follows: "This time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, died heroically. His Majesty the Emperor has specially conferred the Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit, First Class, and included him in the Marshal's Office, and specially bestowed the title of Marshal, and specially bestowed a state funeral. This is truly the supreme glory for a warrior. This preferential imperial concern is truly frightening and grateful. Also, at the time of the funeral, a special imperial envoy and envoy were sent to grant the honor of an imperial visit, and we were also honored to receive the honor of a visit from His Imperial Highness, which is also extremely frightening and grateful. The heads of allied countries have also sent telegrams to express their condolences, and have awarded the highest medal and bestowed special treatment, and have been uniformly condoled by officials and people from all walks of life in the country, which is especially worthy of gratitude. The entire officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet go without saying, and all the officers and soldiers of the Navy are deeply grateful for this imperial grace, and their determination to devote their loyalty must be even stronger. The commander-in-chief personally going to the front line to command his subordinates is the traditional spirit of our country's navy. Among them, Marshal Togo specially emphasized and practiced the experience gained in the Russo-Japanese War, and taught it to the younger generation. This kind of path regardless of danger is the main reason for our country's navy to win battles. Today, the war situation is becoming more and more important, and there are many difficulties in the future, but all the officers and soldiers of my Combined Fleet, under the command of the new commander-in-chief, Admiral Koga, with the certainty of victory, inheriting the spirit of Marshal Yamamoto, loyally and courageously, bravely fight forward, and in order to win the final victory, we are determined to fight to the end with an indomitable spirit until the purpose of the holy war is completed."</p>

<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): The 5th was the day of the national funeral ceremony for the late Japanese Marshal Yamamoto. All agencies, schools, shops, and residences in the capital flew flags at half-mast to express mourning.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): Minister of Propaganda Lin delivered a radio address from 9:30 PM to 9:50 PM on the Central Radio Station on the 5th, titled "Mourning Marshal Yamamoto." The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The news of the heroic sacrifice of Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Japanese Combined Fleet, on the front lines has deeply grieved all people in East Asia. Today marks the national funeral for Marshal Yamamoto. As we remember Marshal Yamamoto's past achievements in safeguarding East Asia, establishing everlasting merits, and as we look forward to the bright future of victory in the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but feel inspired in addition to our grief.</p>
<p>The traditional spirit of Marshal Togo of the Allied Japanese Navy, further developed through the collaborative efforts of both the government and the people, has long been a great maritime wall protecting East Asia. As soon as the prelude to the Greater East Asia War began, the British and American navies were surrounded and severely attacked by the Japanese naval fleet in Pearl Harbor and near Zhao Nan Island, immediately laying the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, the Japanese navy exerted its power in the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, the East Pacific, and other places, achieving remarkable results and sweeping away all British and American naval forces. This is not only the glory of the Japanese navy, but also the glory of all East Asian nations. Marshal Yamamoto was the commander who led these invincible fleets in establishing glorious achievements. Therefore, his glory is also the glory of all East Asia. Marshal Togo wrote the first page of the glorious history of the Japanese navy with his great achievements. Every time we East Asians read this page of glorious history, we feel the greatness of the East Asian nations' fighting spirit against the enemy, the strength of the East Asian nations' power to protect East Asia, and we inspire unlimited hope in all East Asian nations. Now, Marshal Yamamoto has written the first page of the glorious war history of the East Asian navy with his military exploits and his blood, increasing the determination of all East Asian nations to protect East Asia, and inspiring the courage of all East Asian nations to defeat the enemy. Marshal Yamamoto is the first person to inherit the immortal spirit of Marshal Togo, and he has expanded and spread Marshal Togo's spirit throughout the entire universe of East Asia. Marshal Yamamoto died in battle on the front lines as the supreme commander. This traditional spirit of Japanese soldiers has further increased the admiration of all East Asian nations. Although Marshal Yamamoto's physical body has died, his spirit will forever be immortal along with the spirit of all East Asian nations to protect East Asia. Marshal Yamamoto died in battle to protect East Asia. Before the Greater East Asia War is completed, we East Asian nations, who are jointly participating in this sacred war, certainly feel boundless grief for the sacrifice of this East Asian national hero. However, when we think of Marshal Yamamoto's heroic sacrifice, it is a great honor for him personally. Moreover, Marshal Yamamoto's sacrifice will inspire all 1 billion warriors in East Asia, creating the Yamamoto spirit of all 1 billion warriors in East Asia. If everyone inherits this great and immortal spirit and engages in a decisive battle against the common enemy of all East Asian nations, then the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be accelerated, and Marshal Yamamoto's spirit in heaven can be comforted.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Discusses the Current Situation with Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th): Mr. Wada, Deputy Director of the East Asia Department of the Asahi Shimbun, and Mr. Miyazaki, Deputy Director of the Shanghai General Bureau, visited the Chairman of the National Government at his official residence at 5:00 PM on the 28th. They respectfully listened to his views on current issues for about an hour. During the meeting, the Chairman, regarding the trends of the world war situation, pointed out that while the United Kingdom and the United States are crediting their vaunted productive power in attempting a counteroffensive, the Axis powers' absolutely invincible posture remains unshaken and no difficulty is to be feared. Since participating in the war, Chongqing has undergone profound turmoil due to the unfolding of new policies. The premise for the collapse of the Chiang regime lies in the strengthening of the National Government itself. The National Government is exerting all its efforts to ensure security and enhance production. With the vigorous development of the New National Movement, it will jointly undertake the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War. The main points of Chairman Wang's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Trends in the World War Situation</p>
<p>The United States constantly promotes the superiority of its productive power, believing that it can use it to carry out a counteroffensive. But from the perspective of the Greater East Asia War, the United States' productive power is not at all to be feared. If they really want to implement the so-called counteroffensive, crossing the vast Pacific Ocean is impossible. Moreover, they must recapture countless islands in the Pacific one by one, so no matter how much productive power they have, they certainly have no assurance of success. It has been a year and a half since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Allied Japan has secured great victories, repulsed the enemy's counteroffensive, and constantly taken the offensive. The defense of Greater East Asia has the solidity of a golden fortress. The feelings of gratitude and respect cannot help but arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>As the ancient proverb says, "Await the weary at ease." If the United States comes to counterattack, the relative advantages of rest and fatigue are already clearly distinguished, and the outcome does not need to be divined. To respond to Japan's fierce fighting on the front lines, China should exert all its strength to eliminate any worries behind it. The recent announcement by the Soviet Union of the dissolution of the Comintern can be said to be a means of abandoning the name while retaining the substance. Relations with Chiang Kai-shek will not improve as a result.</p>
<p>Turmoil in Chongqing</p>
<p>Since January 9th, thanks to Japan's extraordinary assistance, the National Government's autonomous measures have been actively progressing. The people in the peace zone, especially the intellectual class, seem to have firm beliefs and hopes for the future of East Asia. The business people in Shanghai, who previously did not want to come forward, will truly cooperate with the National Government as the National Government's new policies unfold. On the contrary, the turmoil in Chongqing is only intensifying. The recent large-scale return of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops is a manifestation of this fact. Observing the inside story of the turmoil in Chongqing can be divided into two categories: one category believes that Japan's assistance to the National Government is the true and concrete path of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and therefore holds doubts about the current War of Resistance; the other category is those who lack firm opinions, who believe that the unity of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is gradually strengthening, and therefore consider it advantageous to attach themselves to the United Kingdom and the United States. But they have no accurate predictions about this. These two contradictory ideas often cause confusion and turmoil. To induce this turmoil in Chongqing to collapse, one can only strengthen the peace zone itself. I am convinced that this is the fundamental way to deal with Chongqing.</p>
<p>Solidarity of the East Asian Axis</p>
<p>I have visited Japan two or three times, and I have also visited Manchukuo. Each time, I feel that the solidarity of the East Asian nations is getting stronger day by day. There is infinite satisfaction with the future of East Asia. Japan and China have had relations for 2,000 years, but the disputes between China and Japan only occurred 50 years ago. Tracing back from this point, 100 years ago, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia had already begun to encroach on China. The United Kingdom came across the sea from the south, while Russia took the land route from the north. Japan and China were equally the first to bear the brunt of aggression. The Meiji Restoration was the year of Sun Yat-sen's birth. If both China and Japan had put their houses in order and defeated the United Kingdom and the United States, then disputes would not have arisen between China and Japan. The elements of resistance that hinder China's unification should recognize that before harboring erroneous hatred towards Japan, China itself also has a responsibility. From the current point of view, China and Japan can be said to be under the great encirclement of the United Kingdom and the United States. If the United Kingdom and the United States win, then East Asia will perish. The common life and death of China and Japan, and my own thoughts, truly lie in this point.

<h3>Argentina, South America's Only Neutral Country, Experienced a Coup d'état the Day Before Yesterday; Ramirez Has Led Troops into the Capital; President Castillo Fled by Gunboat</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news transmitted by the UK and the US, a revolution has occurred in Argentina. It is said that the main reason for the revolutionary movement is opposition to the neutral policy of the Castillo government, and several legions have also joined the rebellion. According to a Reuters report from Montevideo, after the rebels entered the city, the President decided to leave the capital and is now fleeing overseas aboard the Argentine gunboat "Drummond." General Donazz, the former Minister of the Army, and another General Rosen, have both supported the rebels. It is said that General Rosen sympathizes with democratic countries. The rebellion seems to have been launched in the town of Mío, 15 miles from the capital, and General Rosen is leading 8,000 troops from that location towards the capital. According to the United Press, the capital's defense forces clashed with the rebels on the outskirts.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters dispatch from the Argentine capital, General Ramirez, commander of the Argentine revolutionary army, issued four demands to President Castillo on the 4th, simultaneously with the uprising: (1) Change Argentina's neutral policy. (2) Cooperate with the countries of the Americas. (3) Freedom of elections. (4) Rectify Argentina's political circles.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): It is reported that when the revolution broke out on the 4th, Argentine President Castillo appointed General Marquez as the Commander-in-Chief of the punitive forces. General Marquez is currently directing punitive military operations. It is also reported that Rear Admiral Fincatti has been appointed to succeed Ramirez as Minister of Defense. According to another report, Castillo, accompanied by his cabinet members, left the capital aboard the minesweeper "Drummond," and it is reported that they have arrived in Colonia, Uruguay, across from the Argentine capital. Furthermore, it was previously reported that most of the Argentine navy participating in the revolution has joined the revolutionary army under the command of General Ramirez.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): The German news agency, citing a Montevideo report, stated that Argentine rebel leader, Minister of the Army Ramirez, declared that the purpose of the revolution was to purify Argentine politics and administration, and to fully respect all international treaties stipulating cooperation with other American republics. He also issued an ultimatum to President Castillo, which was intended to adopt a more friendly attitude towards the United States. Argentina is the only country in South America that still maintains a neutral policy. Upon receiving the ultimatum, the President ordered the appointment of General Marquez as the commander of the punitive army to quell the rebellion, while General Rosen led more than 7,000 troops from Mío and advanced towards the capital. According to Reuters, the rebels also demanded that Costa withdraw from the presidential election. Costa is a far-right politician who was proposed as a presidential candidate by President Castillo. Subsequently, Reuters issued a message from the Uruguayan capital stating that President Castillo had not resigned when he boarded the "Drummond" warship. Government troops and rebels had a fierce battle at Oliveira Square. It is heard that the air force also supported General Ramirez, but did not participate in the uprising. The navy was inactive. According to another Montevideo report received in New York, President Castillo announced in a broadcast that the Argentine government had been established on a warship, saying that the government moved to the ship when the rebels entered the capital. Reuters reported from Montevideo last night that the rebels had occupied government offices in the capital yesterday afternoon. News from the Argentine capital received in New York stated that evening newspapers had issued special editions with the headline "Revolution Successful." According to news from the Argentine capital received in New York, an interim legislative assembly was formed yesterday, chaired by General Ramirez, to take over President Castillo's government.</p>
<p>Radio Buenos Aires Announces: Interim Government Formed</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): Radio Buenos Aires broadcast last night a declaration by General Rosen, the leader of the Argentine revolution, stating that he had the support of the military, had formed an interim government, and had taken over all military affairs, calling on the Argentine people to believe in the new government.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital, after the Argentine revolutionary army occupied the capital, it established an administrative committee on the 4th. Real power is in the hands of General Rosen, General Basi of the First Division, and Minister of Defense Ramirez.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): Today, observers here expressed the opinion that the revolution that overthrew the current government in Argentina seemed to have an American conspiracy behind it, pointing out that General Ramirez, the leader of the revolution, expressed support for cooperation with the United States, and that revolutionaries shouted American propaganda war slogans when they entered the capital. It is said that, given the nature of this revolution, the manipulation of the fifth column by the American side is clearly visible, so that Argentina will abandon its neutral policy, and further proves that the policy of the United States is to drag all countries reached by its power into the current whirlpool of war. According to recent news from Washington, the United States has been actively considering a blockade measure to force this only neutral Latin American country to join the anti-Axis side, while the United States continues to exert high-pressure propaganda on Argentina.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news from Washington, Washington officials indicated that the US government will undoubtedly recognize the new Argentine government. Semi-official sources declare that Argentina will join the anti-Axis camp, sever ties with the Axis powers, and join the war.</p>
<h3>Chinese, Manchu, and Thai Military Attaches Express Impressions of Java</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 5th (Central News Agency): A delegation of military attaches from China, Manchukuo, and Thailand arrived here on the 2nd. After inspecting various places, they jointly issued their impressions of visiting Java on the 4th, stating in essence: The Japanese army's occupation of Java has acquired rich resources, which is of great significance for completing the war. Our first impression of visiting Java is that Java, the land of East Asians, has now returned to East Asians. Therefore, for the sake of East Asian co-prosperity, our determination to live and die together has become even stronger. We have inspected the remains of the fierce battle at Kalijati and are deeply impressed by the great achievements of Japan in seizing such an important base in a very short time. We have also inspected the cities of Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, and seeing the bright lives of the residents, we have clearly understood the harmonious and close relationship between the Japanese military police and the residents. The Overseas Chinese in Java have changed from before the war, shed their enemy ideology, and cooperated with the Japanese army. Thanks to the efforts of the military government, Java has formed a powerful base for the co-prosperity sphere. We deeply feel that the future of Java will surely be a paradise for Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Italian Torpedo Squadron Active off the Coast of North Africa; 60,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Sunk in Six Nights; Defenses of Pantelleria Island Consolidated</h3>
<p>Rome, 5th (Stefani News Agency): Italian torpedo planes have been attacking enemy maritime traffic near the African coast, sinking more than 60,000 tons of enemy ships in six nights. Although the enemy uses great force to protect ships and the attack location is close to the enemy base, Italian aircraft continue to carry out this difficult task without slackening.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Stefani News Agency): The situation of the first bombardment of the Italian island of Pantelleria by four British destroyers on June 1st is as follows: around 6:00 PM on the 1st, a team of enemy ships, consisting of four destroyers, was discovered off the north coast of the island and immediately opened fire, bombarding the shore. The coastal artillery immediately returned fire. After both sides exchanged fire several times, the Italian artillery hit one of the enemy ships. The ship was damaged and sailed westward, with flames seen on board. The remaining three ships also ceased fighting and escaped towards Malta under the cover of smoke. It is now known that after the Italian coastal artillery inflicted losses on the enemy, the enemy ships have all withdrawn from the vicinity of the island. The island's artillery has shot down several enemy planes. Pantelleria Island has now become the first line of Italian defense. The garrison and residents of the island have no fear of attacks by the United Kingdom and the United States, and are working more closely together to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency): Local people commenting on the recent resistance of Pantelleria Island to the attacks by the anti-Axis naval and air forces believe that the island has an excellent terrain and very solid defenses, because its harbor is unusually small, making it difficult for even the smallest warships to enter. The island's air harbor is also impossible to land on without knowing the local terrain. The whole island is mostly mountainous, and military operations are impossible without knowing the routes. Therefore, most of the island's garrison is recruited from local residents, and the island has a population of about 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Stockholm Social Democratic Newspaper's correspondent in London, talk of invading Europe has greatly decreased in London. Most of the discussion is now focused on invading the small island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean, rather than Europe. British military observer Wilson believes that attacks by naval and air forces may isolate the island and make it impossible to defend, and that it is also necessary to attack the nearby islands of Linosa and Lampedusa as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>6,000 American Casualties in the Battle of Attu</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): The U.S. Navy Department's report on American casualties on Attu Island is, as usual, a false statement. It initially claimed that the American army suffered only 600 casualties, but on the 4th, it said that the total number of casualties was 1,535. The statements are extremely contradictory, and are no longer trusted by its citizens. Because American citizens, after receiving news from the Japanese headquarters, already knew that the American army on Attu Island had actually suffered 6,000 casualties. The New York Times criticized that this statement was clearly intended to underestimate the extent of the damage, and this is a false official statement.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that the total number of American soldiers captured since the start of the war has reached 78,083, of which 11,307 were captured by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Tensions on the Eastern European Front; Major Battles to Erupt; German Army Wins Decisive Battle at the Mouth of the Kuban River</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters dispatch from its correspondent in Moscow, the situation is quite tense as major battles are expected to erupt on all fronts. Artillery fire roared all day in the Lisichansk region of the Donets front, and a major German offensive is expected soon. In the Kuban region northeast of Novorossiysk, Soviet troops continue to pressure the German defense lines, but are limited by narrow mountain passes and valleys, making it impossible to deploy large forces. The German Air Force continues to heavily bomb the Soviet supply lines and supply bases on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news from the Eastern Front, the third decisive battle in the Kuban River estuary area, which began on May 31, seems to have come to an end on the 3rd of this month under the absolute advantage of the German army after several days of fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>Churchill Arrives in London</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to London sources, British Prime Minister Churchill, who departed from Washington last week, arrived in London this morning after stopping in Algiers and Tunis. Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of the General Staff Brooke accompanied him. Eden joined the Prime Minister's party in Algiers. The group reportedly visited General Eisenhower, Commander of the U.S. Allied Forces in North Africa, and also met with Giraud and members of the new French Committee of National Liberation before proceeding to Tunis to inspect the anti-Axis forces. It is noted that Churchill flew from the U.S. to Gibraltar a week ago, then directly to Algiers to meet with Eden. Reuters reports that the two did not participate in the conversations of Giraud.</p>
<h3>New U.S. Pacific Submarine Force Commander</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Washington D.C. dispatches report that the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that Rear Admiral Lockwood has been appointed as Commander of the U.S. Submarine Force in the Pacific. Rear Admiral English, who originally held this position, passed away in the Pacific a few months ago, and therefore Lockwood will succeed him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Moscow</h3>
<p>Kuybyshev, 5th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naotake Satō, along with First Secretary Takeuchi and five other embassy staff members, departed for Moscow by plane yesterday.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Bulgaria</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Sofia by Umeda, 28th) Bulgarians, known as the "Japanese of the Balkans," have become increasingly tense recently due to the urgency of the situation in the Mediterranean and the looming war clouds over the Balkan Peninsula. During this significant period, from mid-February of this year until recently, terrorist incidents have occurred throughout the country, casting a heavy shadow on the national psyche. The list of victims includes General Lukov, revered as the father of the modern Bulgarian army, former Sofia Police Chief Captain Pantev, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Yanev. Two major sweeps were recently conducted in the capital Sofia, resulting in the apprehension of dozens of hidden criminals. As a result, it became clear that certain assassination cases were carried out on the instructions of the Third International, while others were aided by the British Secret Intelligence Service. Furthermore, several clandestine radio stations were discovered, including stations in Sofia transmitting to the West and to the Soviet Union, as well as a station in the commercial city of Philippopolis between Sofia and Istanbul transmitting to the West, and a station in the Black Sea port of Varna transmitting to the Soviet Union. Most notably, among the criminals, not only were six Jews directly involved in terrorist acts, but two of them were the actual assassins. Consequently, the government has recently adopted fairly stringent measures against all Jews. 13,000 Jews from strategically important areas along the Aegean coast, Thrace, and the hinterland of Salonika (Macedonia), were relocated to Poland in March of this year. These Balkan Jews, unlike those in other countries, exhibit a blatant defiance. The recent turbulent situation in Bulgaria is, of course, due to the secret operations of the British, Americans, and Soviets, each from their different perspectives, seeking to control this gateway to West Asia. The British and Americans aim to plunge Bulgaria into anarchy through these terrorist acts and to sever the ties between the well-trained Bulgarian army and the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is not limited to Bulgaria; in Greece, Serbia, Dalmatia, and other regions, the British and Americans are also carrying out such plots, especially along the Adriatic coast, where armed groups are carrying out terrorist acts. Bulgarian military experts have warned: "Pay attention to the Adriatic Sea!" The Soviet Union's thinking differs from the British and American method of separating the Balkans from Germany. The Soviet Union aims to incorporate Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece into its sphere of influence, forming a Balkan federation. In Serbia, Montenegro, parts of Albania, and Greece, the Soviet Union has considerable influence, countering the armed groups of the British and Americans to suppress their activities in these areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Anglo-American and Soviet strategies for the Balkans and their cooperation in Sofia are not only not in harmony, but they also harbor mutual suspicion, with an insurmountable divide existing between them.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's goal of forming a Balkan federation is to seek an exit from the Dardanelles Strait to the Mediterranean Sea, consistently inheriting the plans of the Tsarist era. Before the German-Soviet war, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, during a visit to Berlin, stated: First, the Soviet Union should build Soviet bases on the Romanian and Bulgarian coasts. Second, it demanded that the Dardanelles Strait be managed by the Soviet Union. Later, Molotov's deputy, Potemkin, revealed the same demands during a visit to Bulgaria.</p>
<p>This fundamental Soviet policy toward the Balkans poses a great threat to Turkey, far exceeding the threat felt by Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries joined Germany and Italy, hoping to obtain guarantees of a fair new order and prospects. Turkey, due to its territorial holdings in a corner of the Balkans, intends to rely on the guarantee of the British and Americans to reduce the threat from the Soviet Union. The question is whether the British and Americans can provide such a guarantee to Turkey.</p>
<p>The British Ninth and Tenth Armies stationed in Iran and Iraq are poorly organized, while the First and Eighth Armies have just returned from the Tunisian war and are exhausted and in need of a long period of rest. Both require strengthening and reorganization, and the time required will be quite long. Turkey, aware of this, will at least maintain strict neutrality until the end of October of this year, calmly observing the developments of the German-Soviet war that will determine its own fate, hoping for a German victory. In this way, West Asia can forever remain under the balance of power of the British. The aforementioned assassination and terrorist acts are a desperate measure carried out by the anti-Axis side under these circumstances. The British and Americans, in order to make these terrorist acts an effective political check and balance strategy, use Jews to carry out various propaganda activities, making the general population of the Balkans feel that a war is about to break out in the Balkans, or that the cities of the Balkan states will soon be subjected to heavy bombing. However, judging from the direct and indirect meetings between the top leaders of Germany and Italy and King Boris III of Bulgaria and other Balkan heads of state, 35 million people have formed a Balkan defense line against the aggression of all hostile countries. Moreover, although the Bulgarian army has not yet participated in actual combat, it has accumulated a great deal of experience in the past, and its military organization is suitable for modern warfare. Therefore, Bulgaria, standing on the front line of the Balkan defense, participating as a member of the Axis alliance, will play an important role in Southeastern Europe.

<h3>Remembering Disaster Victims as the Dragon Boat Festival Approaches - Urgent Fundraising for North China - Mr. Li of Dinghai Generously Donates 100,000 Yuan - Various Industries Automatically Cut Back on Feasts and Donate the Savings</h3>
<p>Regarding the fundraising efforts for the disaster relief in North China, it has been nearly a month since the initiative was launched. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Emergency Relief Committee, various industries have become more aware of the severity of the disaster situation and the urgency of relief efforts. Under the promotion and guidance of leaders from all sectors, the number of donations has been increasing daily. As we approach the Dragon Boat Festival, we in Shanghai, thinking of the plight of the disaster victims in North China who lack clothing and food, are all willing to save as much as possible on festival expenses to contribute to the relief funds, hoping to fulfill our duty as compatriots to help each other in times of hardship, even if only to a small extent. The relief funds collected by this newspaper yesterday alone amounted to over 160,000 yuan, with Mr. Li of Dinghai donating 100,000 yuan alone, generously contributing with a sense of urgency and public spirit.

<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Zhang Case Support Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Zhang Jinhai tragedy occurred, the Chinese people have unanimously advocated that the perpetrators of the crime be punished as they deserve. Unexpectedly, the French police did not prosecute Guo Shiyuan and others. After receiving this information, the Zhang Case Support Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, gathering representatives from the Shanghai First Special District, Second Special District, Municipal Joint Association, Shanghai Special City Farmers Association, Performing Arts Association, Li Jiao Society, Embroidery Industry Guild, Antique Industry Guild, Stone Powder Industry Guild, Fresh Food Industry Guild, Pawnshop Industry Guild, Used Western Clothing Industry Guild, Dyeing and Laundry Industry Guild, Hosiery Industry Guild, Suspenders Industry Guild, Used Clothing Industry Staff Association, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Staff Association, Dongyang Shanghai Native Place Association, Chongqi Hai Shanghai Native Place Association, Anhui Shanghai Native Place Association, Changzhou Shanghai Native Place Association, and other organizations. At the meeting, it was unanimously resolved to continue to provide more vigorous assistance to the Zhang Jinhai tragedy, and would only stop when the goal of punishing the murderers was achieved. The resolutions of the association are recorded as follows: (1) Issue a declaration; (2) Dispatch representatives to form a petition group to request the competent authorities to severely punish the principal and accessory offenders as a warning to others; (3) Appeal to the press to uphold justice in public opinion and redress the grievances; (4) Urge the handling lawyers Shao Bao, San Gao Yun, Lv Ke Gu Ruwen to exert their legal strength to severely punish the principal offenders; (5) Offer condolences to the victim's family. The Support Association also issued a declaration, believing that the failure to prosecute Guo Shiyuan and the other three offenders was difficult to understand, and that Guo should be openly executed to demonstrate justice. However, the French authorities were biased in many ways, such as when the French police requested the Second Special Court to release Guo on bail, which was rejected. They also requested that Guo's shackles be removed, which was also rejected. Now that the Second Special Court has begun formal trials of Guo and others, in order to ensure the safety of the lives of compatriots in the French Concession, attention should be paid to its development. It is also hoped that the French Concession authorities will impose severe penalties on the perpetrators of the Zhang case.</p>

<h3>Brief Commentary - "Convention on Saving on Banquets"</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly proposed practicing wartime living, starting with saving on consumption. Banquets, in particular, are among the most extravagant forms of consumption. Everyone uses banquets to express joy, to convey emotions, and to discuss matters. This is originally not unreasonable in terms of life and friendship. However, in large cities, due to the convenience of material enjoyment, it has gradually become an excessive and extravagant display, simply wasting materials. When we think of the "lack of food" and "lack of satiety" of our compatriots in disaster areas, soldiers on the front lines, and the poor masses, we always feel unbearable. Therefore, we would like to suggest and advocate a "Convention on Saving on Banquets." When hosting a banquet, one must abide by the provisions of this convention and automatically practice it in the spirit of "keeping faith." The content of this convention generally includes the following points:</p>
<p>(1) No foreign wine. Limited use of wine.</p>
<p>(2) No shark fin soup or bird's nest.</p>
<p>(3) No cigarettes provided.</p>
<p>(4) No singing girls hired.</p>
<p>(5) Specify the lowest-priced banquet in the restaurant.</p>
<p>(6) The amount of dishes should be enough to eat, finish, and not waste.</p>
<p>(7) Banquet time should not exceed two hours.</p>
<p>(8) The chauffeur's meal expenses should be self-paid.</p>
<p>The above are just some of the points that come to mind at the moment. Please readers express opinions to supplement and correct. If you agree to participate, please specify your name and occupation and send a letter to this newspaper to be published at any time for joint supervision and compliance.</p>
<p>Further, use the savings to donate to North China disaster relief, contribute to various good deeds, and provide to the government as national donations.</p>

<h3>Economic Circle: Brief Comments: Commercial Profits and Public Life</h3>
<p>Limiting profits is a condition required by controlled economic ideologies; stabilizing people's livelihood is a condition required by wartime economic policies. Therefore, the coordination of the above two conditions is absolutely necessary. Limiting merchants' profits is precisely to suppress commodity prices, and suppressing commodity prices is precisely to stabilize people's lives. This is perfectly clear.</p>
<p>The serious situation caused by the strike of more than 500,000 coal miners in the United States has forced us to trace the cause. Originally, what the American coal miners demanded was better living standards, but the result was that the mine owners raised coal prices, which directly affected the cost of various industries and indirectly increased the prices of various commodities. What the miners gained was only a nominal increase in wages, because prices, due to the mine owners raising coal prices, increased more than wages; the result of this chain reaction was a serious strike wave that was somewhat out of control.</p>
<p>Because of this "lesson," we feel even more that in the difficult wartime situation of people's lives, limiting commercial profits is indeed an important issue worthy of deep consideration. The profits of industrial and commercial enterprises with lower costs should certainly be limited, and the profits of industrial and commercial enterprises with large-scale operations should especially be limited; the so-called large-scale refers to some monopolistic enterprises, or those that supply military needs, or those that regulate supply and demand in the market. Because the larger the scale of industrial and commercial operations, the greater the impact of their every move on the prices of daily necessities.</p>
<p>In a word, legitimate industrial and commercial circles should take "national economy" and "public life" as the premise of their operations, and should not take "profit" as their prerequisite, because only when commercial profits are rationalized can commodity prices be rationalized.</p>
<h3>Merchants in All Industries Settle Accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival; Banks and Money Houses Consolidate Credit; Agricultural Product Loans Will Be Accommodated as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival account settlement period. Companies, factories, and firms have distributed lists and sent staff to collect outstanding customer accounts. During the settlement period, all transactions are limited to cash. At the same time, for all matured loans to banks and firms, whether secured or unsecured, funds are being transferred and managed to repay them in order to maintain the inherent credit of commerce.</p>
<p>Market Finance</p>
<p>Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, banks and firms are particularly busy with collections and disbursements, and the amount of check clearing has surged. Market finance is tighter than before due to the preparation of reserves by banks and money houses and the tightening of loans by the Central Reserve Bank. However, legitimate needs of various industries, such as loans for purchasing spring cocoons, wheat, and rapeseed, will be accommodated as much as possible, with the aim of reviving the rural economy.</p>
<h3>North China Political Affairs Commission Stipulates Grain Prices</h3>
<p>(Beijing, 5th, Central News Agency) The North China Political Affairs Commission announced the following (prices per 100 kilograms near the railway lines): Wheat 165 yuan, millet 139 yuan, corn 129 yuan, sorghum 109 yuan. This price determination will be implemented simultaneously throughout North China starting from June 21st. Those who violate this price for buying and selling will have the food purchased by the buyer and the profits exceeding the price by the seller confiscated, and will be severely punished. However, the prices in the Su-Huai area will be determined separately based on this price and in consideration of the local market price. In addition, due to the special economic relations in Shanxi Province, this stipulated price may be determined separately with the local procurement and transportation agency as the center. The current regulations apply to various regions in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Restores Price Review Committee</h3>
<p>In order to effectively promote central laws and regulations and actively adjust prices in this city, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Stabilizing Prices, has restored the Municipal Price Review Committee. All statutory committee members have been appointed by relevant agencies in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Organizational Regulations for Central County and City Price Review Committees. The committee has now been organized and will convene its first inaugural meeting on the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>News of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks, which had been sluggish for many days, suddenly showed their edge yesterday, and people from all sides are optimistic. Investors are increasingly eager to buy before the holiday. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy continued its upward trend from the previous day and reached an unprecedented new high price. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory also rose by more than one yuan, and buying interest also arose. The rise in department store stocks is still slight, with Wing On, Sincere, and China National Products each rising by several yuan. China Underwear rose slightly, and King Fook Shirt and Socks took the lead in rising by one yuan. The textile industry was also favored by buyers, with Wing On Textile suddenly breaking through a major barrier, and China Dyeing also showing higher prices. Nanyang Tobacco Company was firm; Great China Match Company still showed a slight decline. Shanghai Municipal North District Water &amp; Electricity, China Electric Company, and Kung Sing Electric and other Chinese stocks are also progressing in the same upward direction. In the cultural industry, Chung Hwa Book Company rebounded close to a major barrier; World Publishing remained flat; the transaction price of The Commercial Press actually fell. In addition, various miscellaneous stocks, such as Chiu An Industrial and Tung Yih Trust, are trending firmly; New Estates and China Timber are also in greater demand than supply.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that when the Chinese stock industry merchants held a regular dinner meeting the day before yesterday, everyone believed that investing in Chinese stocks should be provided with the latest and most recent reference materials. Therefore, it was decided to start widely soliciting customers after the Dragon Boat Festival to subscribe to the latest "Pocket Chinese Stock Treasure Book" jointly distributed by the Yao Gu Daily News and the Enterprise Weekly Society. Because the book is still being compiled, it will be published in mid-July.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Remained firm yesterday. People are optimistic. Because it is heard that stocks and other lines are firm, public bonds cannot fall. Five types all saw upward squeezing, but trading was not active.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Local jewelry stores of this city, Da Hsin Tong, listed the price of jewelry gold at the beginning of the market, still exchanging at the limited price. Trading inside and outside the industry was not active. The price is rising in the trading, not far from the limited price, but there is little trading. The market condition of refined silver has not changed.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Selling Stockpiled Goods Has Passed; Materials Investigation Enters Tense Phase</h3>
<p>Regarding the military procurement associations involved in hoarding incidents, the embassy has made a clear statement. Furthermore, Chen Gongbo, concurrent chairman of the Materials Investigation Committee, made a speech. At present, all parties are extremely concerned about thoroughly investigating hoarding, and the deadline specified for selling stockpiled goods before June 2 has also passed. Therefore, it is expected that the authorities will soon convene the first Materials Investigation Committee meeting.</p>
<p>According to the organizational outline of the Materials Investigation Committee passed at the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 13, more than twenty days have passed, and during these twenty days, the key points of the investigation policy have also been formulated, and it is heard that the list of investigators has also been internally determined. Therefore, when the first committee meeting is held soon, it will definitely be able to actively start dealing with the hoarding problem.</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Major Commodities Hoarding, promulgated on May 3, clearly stipulates that members of non-major commodities industry associations who hoard materials before the implementation of the regulations should report to the competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of the regulations and sell them to the industry association at the limited price. Article 9 stipulates that members of major commodities industry associations who hoard materials before the implementation of the regulations should register with the competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of the regulations.</p>
<p>According to the deadline, it expired on June 2. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Materials Investigation Committee will use the registration before June 2 as the basis to start the investigation work, and the handling of the hoarding problem has left the preparation period and reached the stage of starting a comprehensive investigation. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland New Report of June 5)</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Firms Not Members of Associations</h3>
<p>Industry associations in this city are complying with the intentions of the authorities. In order to adapt to the wartime system and strengthen their organizations, they have all been adjusted and reorganized separately, and are handling member registration. Legitimate businesses in each industry must join the association to maintain their business. It is understood that at present, the industry associations are actively handling member registration, and the deadline is approaching, in order to sort out and report to the authorities for review. As for stores that do not join the association or are found to be uncooperative after review, the authorities will crack down on them and order banks and money houses not to deal with them in order to maintain the law.</p>
<h3>Public Life: The Life of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>— Chen Liqing</p>
<p>I have read articles about the lives of bank clerks and postal workers in this column before. In today's world of soaring prices, it is indeed difficult to make a living, but civil servants working in the government have a much harder time than bank clerks and postal workers, because the treatment of civil servants is restricted by qualifications and regulations, and is still based on the "Provisional Salary Table for Civil Officials, etc." promulgated on September 23, 1933, and amended on September 23, 1936.</p>
<p>The regulations of the official salary table stipulate that the entrusted level ranges from grade six to grade one, with a salary from 55 yuan to 200 yuan. Among the staff employed by each government agency, the number of entrusted grades three, four, and five is the largest. The monthly salary for grade five is 130 yuan, grade four is 140 yuan, and grade five is 160 yuan. It can also be said that the above numbers are the general standard for the salaries of civil servants. Although the government authorities, in order to make civil servants feel at ease in their service, issued a general order to affiliated agencies starting in November and December of the 30th year of the Republic to issue two temporary subsidies of 80%, those with a monthly salary of 160 yuan can receive a temporary subsidy of 160% totaling 256 yuan, for a total of 416 yuan; those with 140 yuan will receive a total of 364 yuan in salary and subsidies; those with 130 yuan will receive a total of 338 yuan in salary and subsidies, and so on. However, the position of a staff member receiving a basic salary of 160 yuan is already at the level of "section chief" or "chief clerk." The integrity of civil servants varies from corrupt to honest, but "the honest remain honest, and the corrupt remain corrupt." If a comparison is made between the honest and the corrupt, there are still more honest people than corrupt people. However, to bring things back, the treatment of civil servants is so low, and the standard of living is so high, those who are honest do not necessarily dislike money themselves, but most of them have other concerns and are unwilling to become corrupt.</p>
<p>I recall that before the 17th year of the Republic, during the military era, the monthly salary of staff handling likin taxes was mostly only six yuan, but the monthly food cost was seven yuan. The income from salary was not even enough to eat, so the staff came up with all sorts of ways to make money. Later, when the National Revolutionary Army came south, the likin tax was abolished and taxes were increased. The treatment of civil servants was also improved accordingly, and their lives were adjusted, and corruption naturally decreased. I think that using the current treatment of civil servants to manage their real lives is really likely to step into the era before the 17th year of the Republic. I think: civil servants are not provided with food and lodging. Now, if you pay for meals on a monthly basis, isn't each meal nearly 200 yuan per person? If you add up the three meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, one person's food expenses alone will cost more than 500 yuan. According to the salary schedule in the Civil Official Rank Salary Table, plus two temporary additional subsidies, unless you add the basic salary of the recommended rank, it is really difficult for one person to "eat" alone.</p>
<p>About two months ago, I read in the newspaper that the government authorities were suggesting ways to improve the lives of civil servants, and that daily necessities were planned to be rationed. Which of us civil servants does not hope that this plan will succeed? We also hope that it will be realized as soon as possible, so that we can reduce the suffering of our civil servants' lives as soon as possible.</p>
