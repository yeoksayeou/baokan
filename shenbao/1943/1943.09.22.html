<p>社評</p>
<h3>金融與產業的關係</h3>
<p>頃見「中國工業月刋」」第一卷第七期，載有「溝通金融資木與產業資本技術問題座談會」紀錄，此會的出席者，有經濟學者及工商金融各界人士。討論的範圍，是以政府頒佈的戰時經濟政策　領中，關於穩定幣値及調劑金融項內「推進產業放款，以扶助生產，並嚴厲取締各種足以助長投機之放款。」為中心對象，就銀行授　業務中放款的技術方面，製成題目數則，發揮意見。我們對於金融界與工商界共以生產為前提，就本身現實問題，計議合理對策，這種求進步的現象，值得贊佩的。我們盼望企業界相互聯繫起來，多多討論，彼此瞭解，不斷的求取進步。不僅企業界本身事業的光明，也是國家經濟建設前途的光明。</p>
<p>我們感覺座談會的意見，是與整個金融業與工商業有着相當關係，雖是少數人的意見，頗有公諸社會共同認識與參考的需要。因此，願意摘取要點，並參以客觀的意見，申引於次</p>
<p>第一，「如何確定借款企業之生產性與非生產性？」「行莊貸出之款，如何加加以有效之監督，使借款者不將借得之款，供投機囤積之用？」「如查明借款者有不合理之運用時，行莊當局應以何種方式收還其資金，或限制其運用？」「開工之工廠，以借款多購原料，門市店以借款多進存貨，如超出正常需要時，是否可視為囤貨？」關於這幾個題目，都有相互的關連，而其中心集中在囤貨一點上。目前金融界的貸款對象，原則上以是否生產性者為標準。但生產性與非生產性的定義與劃分，很難有絕對的界限。而目前上海情形，正多掛着生產的美名而經營囤積投機者，如再予以貸款，無異如虎添翼，助紂為虐。這種名雖生產性者，不以事後監督查察而應付為已足，事前亦應儘可能嚴密注意考量而決定貸款與否。至於借　用途，自應隨時注意，認有囤積嫌疑時，即須主張收回放款，不僅保企自身債權，抑且協助消減囤貨風氣。</p>
<p>第二，「行莊對生產企業之放款，取集團辦理方式，與個別經營方式，究以何者為宜？」這題目召集人意見：「收買農民產品業務，涉及調查，統計，技術等問題，頗為複雜。以採取集團貸款方式校為適宜。已在辦理者如收買　豆貸款銀團，收購小麥貸款銀團等。至工商業貸款，用銀團方式經營者，大規模的尙未多觀。目前上海及蘇浙皖各地的工廠，正在力謀復興，需要銀錢業予以充分貸款，十分殷切。如能組織銀團，集成較大資金，網織優秀人員，擔任貸款業務上所需的調查，設計，技術等事項，指導借款者改進廠務，分散放款風險，保障資金安全。但小額放款及商號貸款，因過於零星複雜，則仍由各家個別直接經營為宜。最感困難者，銀錢業中人，往往幫派甚多，成見很深，目前各自結成以幫派為基礎的營業集團。未能共期以事業為前提，而組織合乎放款原理的銀團，促進同業間多用集團力量，經營數額較鉅的授信業務。」出席者的共同意見，一致認為較大規模的放款，用集團方式辦理，較為便利，並可符合「風險分散」的原則。小規模的工商貸款，仍歸個別辦理，我們也同意這種區分的原則。更願金融界中有力人士，必須認淸時代潮流，以共同利益與發展生產事業為前提，放棄以往幫派的成見，組成無幫無派的聯合集團，經營大規模生產放款，其於生產事業的前途，影響極大。深信金融業中不乏目光遠大者以身作則，領導完成。</p>
<p>第三，「銀行錢莊開支浩繁，僅賴利息收入難期挹注，應如何設法彌補，以利進行？」召集人意見：「在貨幣價值澈底安定以前，借息的高昂是無法避免的現象。但利率縱有提高，行莊仍難恃放息維持開支；而另方面借戶則有不勝重負之感。現在少數行莊，於固定利息之外，另採與借戶合營的方式，參加分紅，如有盈利，則放款行也須分享二三成的紅利」。這一問題，討論熱烈，對於行莊放款參加盈利分配，贊成者認為在此物價劇烈波動之際，放款多少擔負風險，且為應付浩繁開支，不失為公允制度。反對者認為極易流於助長囤積投機，因為放款者亦有盈利，難免鬆懈監督放款用途，頗不合理。我們認為贊成與反對者因觀點不同而主張互異。行莊放款僅取利息，不能應付高物價下的開支，確是事實：而參加加盈利分配復有失監督用途的流弊，也是極可能的，問題的焦點，在乎囤積的作祟，如果生產的利益不少於囤積的利益，根本就沒有助長囤積的流弊，行莊參加正當盈利取之何傷。否則行莊雖云參加正當盈利，而外界不免猜疑。對於「監督借款用途，不使投機囤積」，「查明借款不合理運用時，應收還資金或限制運用」，「工廠以借款購原料，門市店以借款多進存貨，超出正常需要時，是否視為囤貨」諸問題，都將失共用意。因此，為協助消滅囤積，抑平物價，從根本上解決應付浩繁開支的問題，還以不參加盈利分配，忍受暫時困難，較為　當。</p>
<p>最後，我們竭誠盼望政府當局注視金融工商界的種種問題之外，並略述管見，以貢獻於政府　金融企業界人士：</p>
<p>金融界與企業界對於生產事業，隨時隨地應抱具積極經營的精神，如果味消極觀望，則則工商業固然陷於停頓，而金融企業的本身，也會遭遇同樣的命運。</p>
<p>政府對於都市與農村的小工業手工業，應領導金融界竭力扶稙，指導技術，寬貸資金，協助運銷，不拘於統制原則，而使其自由發展，漸趨活潑，以達增加物資之目的。</p>
<p>目前上海嚴格取締囤積，絕不容許投機事業的存在與產生，對於資金出路，就須導引於發展正當工商事業之途，如果政府忽略因勢利導，指導運用，則資金逃避為很可能的趨勢。在此增加生產急於一切的今日，促使資金流入於生產之途，實為當務之急。</p>

<h3>墨索里尼返義　重建法西斯黨　以軍人為中心陣線</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　今日海選社外交訪員稱：與德元首作數日之會議後，墨索里尼離德赴義，以便注視該處之發展。法西斯方面人士均望新共和法西斯黨將於下邊內實告組織完成，據云，注氏現正集中其西意力於重建法西斯軍人及改組法西斯黨，並擬以法西斯軍人爲新共和及法西斯武裝軍隊之中心棟棵·新法西斯政府之首領是否將同時爲國家之元首或由二人分任一事，尚屬未悉，目前因過去數日中續有法四斯政治犯一批被釋，故墨氏手下之高級法西斯黨員已日見增多，惟路透所傳前外長　亞諾亦被德軍救出一事則非事實，因齊亞諾現在英美所佔之義境另一部內，故必　定其爲『失踪』，即前法四斯黨嘗記官史柯若亦然，法西斯人士對其失踪極爲遺憾。</p>
<h3>義境德軍北移　堅守那不勒斯　英美軍忙於整理戰綫</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　反軸心軍因於薩勒諾灣頭　遭德軍猛烈反攻，故已積極向該方面增強兵力。傳北上之英第八軍於那不勒斯戰綫上，兵力已　十師之衆，然德軍司令　賽　元帥尚未向前綫出動預備兵力，而將根據反軸心軍今後之動向，以整　　金之</p>
<p>迎擊陣勢</p>
<p>德軍當屆二十日下午就那不勒斯戰綫之戰况宣稱如次：　因加自拉布里亞州及阿普里亞州撤退之德軍，已與那不勒斯南方主力軍會師，故該方面戰綫已以薩勒諾爲中心，略向北方移動。英軍於上週末在艦砲射華之掩護下，曾以坦克車隊再度對薩勒諾市附近之德軍陣地加以攻擊，然未收任何戰　。　美軍十九日自巴特巴里亞方面略有進展，又於美第五軍南方作戰之英第八軍佔據阿爾塔威後，前進之速度巳形緩慢，現反軸心軍援軍又於卡斯特拉巴特及阿格洛波里附近登陸，　反軸以軍之計劃，似在確保自那不勒斯至福齊之載綫，以美第五軍担當那不勒斯方面之作戰，英第八軍擔當福查戰綫，然美軍於薩勒諾戰綫已蒙重大　害，英第八軍亦因自加拉布里亞州經</p>
<p>山岳地帶</p>
<p>北上長途跋涉已感疲憊，故於總反攻之先，尚須整理戰綫，今後數日間那不勒斯戰綫之戰局或將入於佔察戰。同時反軸心軍恃海上勢力，成將於義北方企圖登陸，然凱賽林元帥所部德軍已與羅美爾元帥之北部軍取得緊密聯絡，故對反軸心軍作戰已有萬全準備。</p>

<p>伯倫二十日中央社電　巴特里奧元帥藉無綫電發衷演說，籲請義大利民眾反對曾與義人駢肩作戰三年之久之德軍，而接受對反軸心國家之和平條件。但在阿爾及里亞無綫電所作之呼籲，並未提及巴特里奧政府對德宣戰之事件，此一步驟乃外交方面所非常渴　者。巴氏爲停戰條件作辮護之　　稱，無條件投降之說法已成過去，且輿今日已變更之情形已不相關。巴氏指謫德軍在頓河·里比亞·突尼斯·及加拉布里里遺棄義軍。而美軍乃義大利之老同志也。</p>

<h3>義國的新情勢　巴陀里奧投降德國早有準備</h3>
<p>七月二十五日　迫　索里尼下野、巴陀里與組織新　時的空氣及其以後的情勢、即已預科巴政權即將投降英美。果然、巴陀里　在九月三日即在風辱的無條件投降條約上簽字、背叛盟邦　出賣祖國的奸謀·全世界均深表憎惡。這在德國有何反響·德國如何應付這新事態，均為世人所急欲獲悉的消息。九日夜朝日　聞社　國際電話向柏林特派員守山探詢如下：聽說巴陀里奧政權無條件投降接　這報告後的德國的　響如何？德方早已預料墨氏下野以後、義國的巴政　遲早將單獨媾和。因而對義政策在軍事上，政治上均非常愼重。所以此次的停戰協定、德國當局並不視爲星突然的事件　而不表驚異：但雖說在意料之中，也目前有這種事態出現，　德國氏衆不無相當術動而大爲興奮。九日出版的德國各種報紙均以大字　　「卑怯的巴陀里奧之背叛，」「卑怯的巴陀里奧之倒戈」、其小標題亦稱巴陀里奧「出賣軸心於敵人」，由此可知德方對巴陀里奧政府抱着怎樣的感想。巴陀里奧對三國同盟的行為，違反日德義不單獨媾和的條文，極口非難巴陀里奧政權之卑怯的行為，　表示德國　野的憤激。</p>
<p>這攻擊義國的中心，大體向巴陀里奧、對義國國王的攻擊　少。</p>
<p>本社：德國政府諒巳有成算應付今日新事態</p>
<p>守山：德國的對策，以目前而論，從軍事政治二方面的意義說來，大可注目。大概對此次通敵的巴政府、一開頭即不認其為正統政府，趁此機會，把以前所計劃的國家主義法西斯勢力認作正統政府。輿之協力作戰至最後勝利爲止。</p>
<p>巴陀里奧的反件西斯革命發生的時候，德國即擬援救界索里尼至德國，建立義國正統政府，擊減巴陀里奧以下的反法四斯一派。德國政府慎重應付，暫以巴陀里奧爲對手，儘量設法多派軍隊至義國，茲已獲得實質的效果。</p>
<p>此次以墨氏名義在北義建立的新法四斯義大利政府、即　此方針進行老。法西斯的中心分子、仍依三國同盟而奧軸心國協力作戰。</p>
<p>本社：那麼現在義大利可分爲反軸心方面的義大利和新法西斯義大利政府下的義大利二部了。</p>
<p>守山：誠然。今後可分爲英美支配下失卻自由的義大利政府及忠實於三國同盟的新法西斯政府二部。但義國民衆沒有分製爲二而相爭的可能性、</p>
<p>所以巴陀里奧政權所希望的和平並未獲致，義大利在這　變成戰塲，國家分裂的危機，使義國民眾愈加認清悲慘的现實。</p>
<p>倫敦方面的空氣，對巴政府的投降躊躇满志地稱「此次巴政府的投降，并不是用，和平交涉那種方式，乃是被　　體無完膚的完全投降，而最出力於這交涉者，爲義攻擊軍之主力的英國的功勞。」</p>
<p>美英今後對　政策，將踢開巴陀里奧，製造新自由主義政府，想亳不假借地使用義國的土地資源工業交通等一切設備以從對德戰爭，分裂爲二的義大利，實際上有多少力量可分，有待於事實的發展，不能預測。墨氏的下野，其值接動機，顯然在於以國土及巴陀里奧爲中心的軍部的收北主義所促成，所以今日的義大利，大非昔比，守護北義法四斯殘黨的德國，不能不在南方戰緩作戰，且其中心也祇有德國的軍力，德軍親自出動至第一綫對抗英美，產生了與以前的南方戰綫不同的戰爭狀態。</p>
<p>以前指揮不統一的情形，從純軍事的立場，可行使自己的方針，一部份德國的論者解釋稱，德國因新事態而獲得了行動的自由。</p>
<p>本社：軍事的對策如何？在義國內部的德軍又如何？</p>
<p>守山：　停戰協定在九月三日由巴陀里奧的代表及埃森霍華的代表之間簽訂。在這九月三日，英國的第入軍柱加拉普里亞半島開始義國本土登陸作戰。但全般的看來，德方早已料到此着、故發國南部德軍僅有幾個中隊殘留在那裏，軍事上的損害幾可說沒有。又巴陀里與軍如其攻擊德軍，是否將與英美軍一同攻擊，尚不可知，然德軍似已早有防備。總之巴陀里奧是破壞三國同盟的背叛者，法國政府投降時，和此次巴政府的態度此較起來更比　國不如，一味取媚英美、這豈是第一流國家的態度？因而德國大爲憤慨。（翔：譯白九月十一日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼　出險的前後</h3>
<p>墨索里尼救出了！這誠是駭人聽聞的新聞。巴陀里奧政府無條件投降後，在義國北部，義大利法西斯國民政府宣告成立，並發表」以墨索里尼任統帥」，但那終究是　「墨索里尼之名」·墨氏的行踪究竟何在·杳無消息。自義大利政變以來、其所在固漠然不知，卽其生死，亦無確息。中立國的情報稱墨氏巳被送至北非，讓渡於反軸心軍。德國通信亦已承認此事，而不能否定。然而十日日的德國元首大本營發表，德軍降落傘部隊業已救出墨索里尼，誠是奇蹪。聽到這消息而不安堵者。大概沒有吧！接到　報告後，朝日新聞社於十二日夜立即接通國際電話向相林特派員守山探詢德國方面的鼓動情形。以下是守山特派員的話：</p>
<p>朝日新聞社：墨索里尼安然被救出，誠堪稱爲奇蹪而值得注意。日木方面也爲之靈動，德國方面，對這戲劇性的事件，大概也很興奮吧！</p>
<p>守山特派員：八月十二日夜，德國大本營特別發表，被巴陀里奧政　監禁的墨索里尼，在即將移交於北非反軸心軍之前，被德國降落傘部隊及其他敢死隊救出。這是此次大戰中繼赫斯事件以後的富於戲劇性的事件。有軸心陣綫固不必說、即敵方亦大爲衝動。尤其在德國方面，這一二個月來，接連有四西里登陸，巴陀里奧背叛，義國的單獨媾和等不愉快事件，使民心大不髙興。墨氏復返的消息，在南方戰結重又獲得百萬的友軍，德國朝吱均大聲稱快。據當時巴陀里奧政府的發表，墨索里尼的下野·並未經過憲法上合法的手續。料到國王及軍部方面的反法四政變的德國政府，自巴陀里奧政府一出現·即同時暗地進行　救墨氏本人至　國的計劃，但巴陀里奧一派知道墨氏如其到德國時，法四斯及德國的反動、將對自己的運命加以致命的打擊。故屢次　變墨氏監禁的塲所·以混淆德國的耳目。最後知道監禁於伽愛港灣的蓬佐阿島。以希特勒的性格及作風，如其當時墨氏在德國，將絕不承認顯然有單獨媾和企圖的巴陀里奧政府、以墨索里尼政府爲正統、而着手打倒膽敢背叛的　　。　德國雖然努力於千方百計的探索及管救，終衆成功。停戰協定成　以後，一般勘測救囘墨氏巳告絕望，德國官方　正式發表：「墨索里尼爲巴陀軍奧政府所逮捕、巴陀里奧政　根　與敵方所訂的協定，將　墨氏移交英美。」外交部施密特情報長亦在新聞記者會見席上稱：「墨索里尼引渡於北非英美軍的事實。已屬不能否定之勢。」而以爲德方的一切努力·將成泡影。希特勒在十日的演說上稱、「我的血盟之友墨索里尼」、用最好的言辭職美他的的人格、可　釋爲　墨氏的」後辭別之辭。德國民索痛恨巴陀里奧一派背叛的情緒，　見高漲而　烈。但在希特勒作此演說的後一天　墨氏即被德國救出。德國降落傘部隊在何處，如何救出墨氏，雖尚未明白發表，但這是點綴可憎的巴陀里奧反戈一寡之末日的大快人心的活劇。（詡：譯自九月十五”四部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>評言　中堅農民</h3>
<p>農業雖非國家惟一之財源，然國家　源，則不能不說大都仰賴於農業，在平時如此，戰時更是如此·因爲戰時所最顧慮的，就是糧食的缺乏。所以，如何策淮全面食粉增產，乃爲今日各省市會糧增涉會議討論之中心。</p>
<p>經辨思想史中之重農學派，以爲惟用於農業之勞力，可以產生剩餘，並以爲農人剿餘，可以增加兩家財富。中國　來以農立國，且有農業生產之特殊優勢。無疑地。中國生產事業，自仍以重農爲主，而中國之農民，自足稱爲生產階級中之鬥中堅」份子。</p>
<p>糧食與實業兩部會於糧食增進會議中提出各地合作社舉辦「中擊農氏訓練班」，以期　加生產，近已開始籌備一切，以期迅速推進。所謂「中擊農民」，就是農民中的骨幹。養成這樣一個骨幹，必須養成　他們對於農業與國家福利關係的認識，　他們對於改良耕種方法的興趣，　他們對於增淮農業實量的常識，　他們對於開墾荒田荒地的熱忱，　他們對於改造農村生活的實任。」中堅農民」的訓練，至少要包括以上所列舉的幾個基本課題，使其蔚成中國農業生產界中的一支精兵，一個幹部，而其實現，則有待於糧食與實業當局的繼術努力！</p>

<h3>萌芽時代的　托兒所運動　（續）</h3>
<p>合理的敎養</p>
<p>走進上海托兒所的大門，小小的花周裏的美麗的鷄請掀起一陣小小的騷動，前院廊下那木馬和滑梯首先給人以鮮明的印象。前應裹傳出敎請的聲音，原來幼稚班三十多個小孩子正在上課！雖然在課堂裹，孩子們也對先生有說有笑的，像對自己的母親與姊姊一般。</p>
<p>卞主任說·她們辦托見所，對於孩子們的敎　，有四大原則，即是所謂「四化」：</p>
<p>一，平民化：所收孩子，都來自窮苦的家庭，將來出所後，也要囘到窮苦的家庭，因此在所內要使習於簡單。樸素·清潔·特別使其注意個人及公共衛生道德。</p>
<p>二，科學化：在管理上，無論是起居和飲食，所內桌椅用且及玩具等設備，或是事務方面的，如保姆工作的分配。以及帳目等等，都嚴格求其系統化，並使符合分工合作節省人力物力的原則。</p>
<p>三，敎育化。：實行「生活即教育，教育即生活」的新教育理論，使兒童自幼就從所裏的敎師，保姆。友伴以及玩且各方面·認識和學得生活上的各種經騐，特別是使孩子們在所　過慣了聞體的·教育的，紀律的生活。</p>
<p>四。家庭化：在托兒所裏，有許多是幾個月甚至幾年看不見自己的父母的，化是，每一個兒童的健全的人格之發展，却少不了父母之愛！因此，婦們力求托兒所的空氣，避免尋機關化從保姆至教師，都要像是每一個兒童之慈母一樣慈愛，孩子們　托兒所中可以同樣獲得　大的母愛，而且是社會性的無偏無溺的母愛，養成新時代正確的人生觀·共意義更加重大。</p>
<p>托兒所的兒童，現分四組，三足歲以上的三十餘名爲甲組，略施初級幼稚敎育，其餘二足歲至三足歲爲乙組、一是歲至一二足歲爲丙組，以適當的游戲及唱歌爲主，隨時利甲機會，訓練其自動能力，此外一足歲以下的爲了組。在原則上是敎養並重不過對於四歲以下的兒童，並不鄭重於讀書識字。只在給他們一個優良的學習環境，使習慣於自助（如自己洗手，洗臉自己吃穿衣）及互助合作。這種理想的硫，需要至在的愛心和忍耐。</p>
<p>生活片段面</p>
<p>一清早，托兒所裹已經開始熱鬧起來了，保姆們要照護孩子們起身，早　，游　，護士們要整備替孩子們檢查健康狀態，教師們也得研究什麼更新頴和有效的敎法。整個上午，據說是每天最忙的時候。</p>
<p>兒童垢膳食，每日早　大抵爲豆對和粥類，中午則甲乙兩組吃飯，有一葷二素佐餐，以熱蛋，豬肝等爲主，有時買些肉骨煮鴻，丙組以下則以粥及菜泥爲主。下午三點鐘，祚吃點心一次·大抵是餅乾，麵包和豆乳。晚上則爲粥或麵。一般的說，營養是足夠了，其中有幾個感覺缺乏的，則另加特別補充。職員的膳食，爲了經濟關係，不能像兒童一樣講究了。難怪所見的孩子，都很活潑的樣子，特別是幾個乳嬰，白白胖胖的，多麼可愛，但是，卞主任說，爲了奶粉等難得，了組即一歲以下的乳兒，現柱已不得不停止　收了。</p>
<p>孩子們的衣服，一部份由托見所　布特別縫製，有些制服的型式，大部份是各界捐贈的，許多熱心的仕女們，有的捐布，有的代縫，把他們衣着問題，解決了一大中，不能不替孩子們慶幸。不過近一來捐助者已絕無僅有，如果秋冬之交娶添製新衣，怕就沒有希望了。孩子們的臥室都在二樓三樓，不僅空氣新鮮光綫適當，而且還有精美的小鐵床，據說有五十架　開辦時購買的，要在今日，怕不要　日至一千餘元一架，此外有些較大的孩子，暫時借用着女靑年會宿舍的成人用鋼床，而幾個嬰兒則偕用著同仁醫院的精美的小鐵床。此外·還特製矮腳帆布大床。所有這些床上，都有一律白色的被褥和珠羅紗帳。每一個臥室，都很整齊，清潔，而且美麗！</p>
<p>撫養他長大</p>
<p>在舊時代，自己養不活孩子而拋進育嬰堂是家庭乃至人生的悲劇，而且也永遠不能再看見自己的親子了！可是，現在能把孩子送進托兒所倒成爲家庭乃至人生最大的幸運，孩子在這裹受到比家庭更週到和合理的愛撫，將來給自己雙親帶來健全的身心和無比的愉快！</p>
<p>孩子們在托見所除了教養以外，更受到健康的保障，在平日，一夜二十四小時，沒有一小時把人負責照料，這幾乎是任何家庭都辦不到的！　　　！兩位護士，主任護士擊業於湖州福音醫院，並在北平協和醫院服務甚久另一位護士也對小兒科的醫療看護，有豐富的經騐。她倆日夜輪流主量所內攻藥衛生工作，托兒所還請得同仁第一醫院·及紅十字會　　的協助，無論　師測所或送院診治，概不取費，藥品也允半價計算。如遇傳染病，則送前工部局隔離醫院，但是，由於平常防治得法，營良好，所以成立以來據說不僅從無死亡，即病患也不多，她們不僅注意見兒童身上的疾病，而且注意全所清潔，所有房屋，勤加清掃，衣服等也依時消毒，手巾而盆等各人分別使用，一遇有病兒童，立即遷入特備的房間，現在二樓有二間小房，就有三個患　　的兒童，與其他兒童隔離施行治療。在週到的愛撫之下，全所兒意都很健康活撥、</p>
<p>孩子們的愛撫者—托兒所的工作者，柱組織上屬於某督敎女靑年曾，奾們特設有上海托兒所委員會，聘請度席委員一人及委員數人，爲該所最高機關，所有實際工作，由　任負責，就是女靑年曾幹事卞煦孫女士，她很賺遜，不願公開她過去輝煌的學歷輿　歷，但在對托兒</p>
<p>的事業，自發起創辦，籌備　劉以至開辦後一人兼負全　行政，文書·脅計，庶務，交際等工作，已充分顯露她對於改造社會事業認識之正確，犧牲服務的精神和辦事的能幹了。</p>
<p>托兒所的工作是忙　而辛苦的，而且爲着對每一個兒童都　週密愛撫，必須有較多的管教者，現在計有保姆十四位，她們大部份是女靑年會保姆短期訓練班畢業的學員，至少巳受過六個月的訓練，知道愛撫幼兒的責任和技術。也有幾位是會經服務於各大醫院的助理護士，兼且醫療賞識。她們除了每星期輪流休息半天之外，真是日夜　勞，一有暇時，還乘機互相討論研究改進工作的方法，「工作小忘學習」，幼稚生的激育工作，由一位畢業於蘇州景　幼師的主仟教師負責，另有助教一位。因爲「敎管合一」她們的工作也不輕鬆呢！工友四人，女的二個洗衣，沈尿布，煮飯，忙得緊，男的二個，從內勤到外勤，還得磨　乳　，也不容易得暇</p>
<p>愛撫者的責任帶大·事務繁多，然而她們的待遇却是意外的非簿——除供給作宿，每天二粥一飯和。元半的菜　（兒童爲三元）以外，保姆每月只支一百元，護士也只三百元和四百元，主任更不在所裏支薪，以減少托兒所的支出。由此可見她們完全抱着機牲服務的精神而來的！那得不使人感佩？</p>

<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>論專家政治</h3>
<p>— 由蘭生</p>
<p>什麼是專家？這話在現在的中中社會，須待說明。所謂專家，自然一是有專門學識的。一是有行內（業內，經騐的，如果廣義說來，都算專家，狹義說來，僅指是上一種，就是專門學識的專家。更詳細說來，上一種是由專門學校出身投入於所學事業職塲而毫無工作的專門家，另一種並非由專門學校出身，不過因爲他長年在該事業內工作，獲得人所不得「盡知盡能」的知識，道項人才也是很有用的。</p>
<p>在中國現在的社會中，第一種專家很少，第二種專家則頗多，社會上的需要，自然還是第一種專家。中國社會之何以不能多產第一種專家，並非教育制度之失敗，乃是政治的社會的因素所致。「畢業即失業」「學非所用」，是中國政治社會之不良，在政治上及社會上的人事，多基於封建關係，而爲好惡之選用，所以中國不能產生第一流的專家，而只能產生第二流的專家，可是所謂行內業內專家，並不能是眞正的專門家，項多恭維他們是經騐家便夠了。</p>
<p>中國需要專家，在政治上更為需要，政治是社會一切的領導，如果政洽而不為專家政治，則中國社會的一切，更不能發展，中國的復與，也更談不到。</p>
<p>我們所知道的，日本就算是專家政治。日本女官制度，由見習起而屬官，事務官，理事官，到政務官，都有嚴格的銓叙及升降調遷並人事上的賞罰保障規律。日本文官制度，全要之點，在於事務官與政務官的分野。事務官務須按照依次升遷的順序而來，保障其所任的職塲不受政潮影響俾得安心服務。政務官則否，可以政治立塲關係，而為退職與復職之相常的自由意志行動。事務官是辦理事務，政務官則為處理政務，事務官的任意退聯，影響社會各般事業，政務官係以政治上的主義輿政　而登合，例如內閣改組或以政變而致政治主義體制及政　轉換之　，與巳不合，則　然身退。這樣，一國的政治，在不影響人民生活之下，才能爲不　的進</p>
<p>我們中國則不然，政務官倒了，事　官甚至以下的小職員，也要　帶去職，以致影響社會事業與人民生活。殊為重大。這不是說新官到任。就下令儘撤舊員，也有一部的自動，所謂「殉職」「共進退」。這種「愚忠」的表示，在文明國家中是不許可的，因爲官乃公職，爲國服務，而非為個人效忠，道種只知個人而不知國家的人，是封建制度下的殘餘行為。中國的政務官常有在受職之際。已不暇計此，「學非所用」，以喜悅好惡而為人事上之處理，所謂「鷄犬飛升」，到了下台，僚屬惴惴　自然也就所謂「樹倒猢猻散一了。</p>
<p>中日兩國的文官制度，兩相比較，在日本自然能多　專家，可以說是專家政治，在中國如上述狀况之下，非但不能多產專家，僅有的少數專家，也未必能得學而致用的職　，意志薄弱的人，也有自甘暴棄的·簡直是摧殘專家了，談不到專家政治的</p>
<p>所謂「書生誤國」「秀才造反」云云，這是社會不信任專家政洽的口頭禪語。中國的政治，事害上也許有這類的事，但我們認為尙有考量的必票。一時的梟雄，若與邦籌備之流，漢高常溺儒冠，侮辱書生之至，他做了皇帝，且請叔孫通做女　的「朝儀」，昭烈之三顧孔明，更是大家知道的。孔明「自比管樂」，常時年紀還輕，未必有政治經騐，但他在蜀竟能大展鴻猷，壓倒了老官法正·所以說「秀才造反」或者「不成」，而一書生誤國」，則有「未必」。</p>
<p>民國以來，能得在民　十年前後，曾有一度的學者內閣。當時總擴為王亮　博士，財長　文幹。外長顧維鈞並溫爾和等，閣員多數為博士，故人稱之曰「學者內閣」，也有嘲之曰「學究內閣」的。後來果以官僚吳景濂的策動，用金佛朗案中傷了羅文幹，但王老博士以實任內閣立塲向總統抗議「遠憲」。這個事件，王博士等的不失重生本色事小，而維持　統與挽救政風，其功非淺。二十年來的牧台演變，官僚吳景　，終以不容於天地（其在保定自嘆語）而亡，較諸王羅諸人，當不可同日而語。胡適之氏曾提倡過一好人政治」，這種維心之論，或指政　官而言，事務官方面，我們至少要提倡「專家行政」」。所謂「專家行政」，一般人或者以爲縣想過高，不合實際，一則中國並無多「專家」，僅有的少數「行家」，也可以說是「政弊專家」，還是要不得的，但為國家百年大計起見，事務官級的銓叙與保障是刻不容緩的，如此便能達到所謂「專家行政」的理思，</p>
<p>者鑑於現在政治上的人事病態，並有感於專家材荒之故，試論如上，不知世人以為如何？</p>
<h3>組織敎職員消費合作社的意見</h3>
<p>— 悚</p>
<p>組織放職員合作社自蔣壽同君提出以後，各方人士都表贊同，紛紛發表意見，我連日讀了這　多文章，也心有好感，敬將一些管見，貢獻如下，</p>
<p>首先，有一個問題，似乎對於組織合作社本身，不很重要，而又不得不加以注意的，聞是中國敎育思想，向受英美浪漫自由主義的熏染，所以早有人主張「敎育獨立」，而此次蔣君在建議組織敎職員合作社的大細裹，其中立場一項，亦竟主張「合作社絕　獨立，與政治不生關係」（大意如此）其實敎育本身，即係政治的一環。何能離政治而獨立，即如拿組織合作社講，將來成立以後，對於經濟的貸與，貸源的疏通，以及運輸的便利等等，在在需要求助政府機關，借用一些政治力量，方能進行順利，雖然，蔣君對於這些，恐亦明瞭，其所謂「獨立與政治不生關係」者，大約係指組織合作社，並無政治性質、也不去千涉政治，以免發生具他不必要的嚕嘛。但此話頗有語病，幫特加以提出、</p>
<p>至於其他各點：</p>
<p>經濟的　措　股款每股不妨暫定百元　每人至少認一股，　中學敎員和大學教授，地位能力，都比小學敎員來得高，每人自　多　一些。最好中學敎員每人認二股·大學敎授，則每人認四股，其他不足之　，除向社會各界公開募集以外，現在國家銀行，都有貸款合作社的規定，則則可向銀行借貸</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Finance and Industry</h3>
<p>Recently, I saw in the "China Industry Monthly" Volume 1, Issue 7, a record of the "Symposium on Connecting Financial Capital and Industrial Capital Technology Issues." Attendees included economists and figures from industry, commerce, and finance. The discussion focused on the wartime economic policies promulgated by the government, particularly concerning stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, with the core objective of "promoting industrial lending to support production and strictly cracking down on various loans that could fuel speculation." Several questions were formulated on the technical aspects of bank lending to generate discussion. We admire the phenomenon of the financial and industrial sectors jointly planning reasonable countermeasures based on their practical problems, with production as the premise. We hope that enterprises will connect with each other, discuss more, understand each other, and constantly seek progress. This will not only brighten the prospects of the enterprises themselves but also the future of national economic construction.</p>
<p>We feel that the opinions expressed at the symposium are highly relevant to the entire financial, industrial, and commercial sectors. Although they represent the views of a few, they warrant public awareness and reference. Therefore, we would like to extract the key points and offer objective opinions below:</p>
<p>First, "How to determine whether a borrowing enterprise is productive or non-productive?" "How can banks and financial institutions effectively supervise loans to prevent borrowers from using the funds for speculation and hoarding?" "If it is found that the borrower has used the funds inappropriately, what measures should the bank or financial institution take to recover the funds or restrict their use?" "If a factory borrows money to purchase excessive raw materials or a retail store borrows money to stock up on inventory beyond normal needs, can this be regarded as hoarding?" These questions are all interrelated, with the central focus on hoarding. Currently, the principle for financial institutions' lending is whether the borrower is productive. However, defining and classifying productive and non-productive activities is difficult. In Shanghai today, many are engaging in hoarding and speculation under the guise of production. Providing loans to them would be like adding wings to a tiger, assisting evildoers. For these nominally productive entities, it is not enough to rely on post-event supervision and investigation; careful consideration should be given before deciding whether to grant a loan. As for the use of the loan, constant attention should be paid, and if there is suspicion of hoarding, the bank should immediately demand repayment to protect its own claims and help reduce the practice of hoarding.</p>
<p>Second, "Should banks and financial institutions adopt a group lending approach or an individual lending approach for productive enterprises?" The convener suggested, "The business of purchasing agricultural products from farmers involves complex issues such as investigation, statistics, and technology. Adopting a group lending approach is more appropriate, such as the soybean loan syndicate and the wheat loan syndicate. As for industrial and commercial loans, the use of syndicates is not yet widespread. Factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are striving to revive and urgently need financial support. Organizing syndicates to pool larger funds and recruit skilled personnel to handle the investigation, design, and technical aspects of lending, guide borrowers to improve factory operations, diversify lending risks, and ensure fund security would be beneficial. However, small loans and commercial loans are too fragmented and complex, and individual operation by each institution is more suitable. The greatest difficulty is that people in the banking and financial industry often have many factions and deep prejudices, forming business groups based on factionalism. They fail to prioritize business and organize loan syndicates based on sound lending principles, promoting the use of collective strength to manage larger credit businesses." The consensus among attendees was that larger loans are more conveniently handled through a group approach, which also aligns with the principle of "risk diversification." Small-scale industrial and commercial loans should still be handled individually, a principle we also agree with. We also hope that influential figures in the financial sector will recognize the trends of the times, prioritize common interests and the development of productive enterprises, abandon past factional prejudices, and form united groups without factions to manage large-scale production loans, which will greatly impact the future of productive enterprises. We believe that there are many in the financial industry with foresight who will lead by example and complete this task.</p>
<p>Third, "Banks and financial institutions have high operating expenses, making it difficult to cover them with interest income alone. How should they compensate to facilitate operations?" The convener suggested, "Before currency values are thoroughly stabilized, high interest rates are unavoidable. However, even with increased interest rates, banks and financial institutions still struggle to cover expenses, while borrowers feel overburdened. Currently, a few institutions are adopting a co-management approach with borrowers in addition to fixed interest, participating in profit sharing. If there are profits, the lending bank also shares 20-30% of the profits." This issue was discussed intensely. Supporters of financial institutions participating in profit distribution believe that during periods of drastic price fluctuations, lenders bear some risk, and this is a fair system to cope with high operating expenses. Opponents believe it easily leads to encouraging hoarding and speculation because lenders also profit, inevitably relaxing supervision of loan usage, which is quite unreasonable. We believe that supporters and opponents have differing views due to different perspectives. It is true that banks and financial institutions cannot cover expenses under high inflation rates by only charging interest. However, participating in profit distribution has the potential for misuse due to the lack of supervision. The focus of the problem is the negative influence of hoarding. If the profits from production are no less than the profits from hoarding, there is fundamentally no risk of encouraging hoarding, and there is no harm in banks and financial institutions participating in legitimate profits. Otherwise, even if banks and financial institutions claim to participate in legitimate profits, the outside world will inevitably be suspicious. The common intention of the issues, such as "supervising loan usage to prevent speculation and hoarding," "recovering funds or restricting usage when inappropriate usage is found," and "whether purchasing excessive raw materials by factories or excessive inventory by retail stores with borrowed funds should be considered hoarding," will be lost. Therefore, to help eliminate hoarding, suppress prices, and fundamentally solve the problem of coping with high operating expenses, it is better to refrain from participating in profit distribution and endure temporary difficulties.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that the government authorities pay attention to the various issues in the financial and industrial sectors. We also briefly outline our humble opinions to contribute to the government and financial and business professionals:</p>
<p>The financial and business sectors should always maintain a positive operational spirit toward productive enterprises. If they remain passive and wait-and-see, industries and businesses will stagnate, and financial enterprises themselves will face the same fate.</p>
<p>The government should lead the financial sector to vigorously support small-scale urban and rural industries and handicrafts, guide technology, provide ample funding, and assist in marketing, allowing them to develop freely without being bound by the principle of control, gradually becoming more active, to increase the supply of goods.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai strictly prohibits hoarding and does not allow the existence or emergence of speculative activities. The outlet of funds must be guided towards the development of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. If the government neglects to guide and utilize the situation, it is very likely that funds will escape. In today's environment where increasing production is paramount, it is imperative to promote the flow of funds into production.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Actively Promoting a "Certain-Victory" Decisive Battle System; Outline of National Policy Operations to Be Announced Tonight</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – In order to cope with the current global war situation, unite the entire nation, and exert every effort to achieve final victory, the Japanese government has decided to actively promote a "certain-victory" decisive battle system. With Prime Minister Tojo at the center, the government has been studying a general outline of national policy operations, which has recently been agreed upon. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 21st, Prime Minister Tojo explained the specific outline and its contents, followed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hoshino, who detailed the specific items. The outline was then passed in accordance with the original proposal. It is expected that each relevant ministry will quickly draft concrete implementation plans based on the spirit of the outline and submit them within the week for cabinet approval, after which they will be implemented immediately. It is reported that the Japanese government will announce the content of the outline on the evening of the 22nd, followed by a broadcast speech by Prime Minister Tojo at 7:30 PM to explain the outline and encourage the nation to rise up.</p>
<h3>Minister of Information Tani Hagio Speaks to Reporters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Major General Tani Hagio, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Information Department, met with reporters on the 21st as usual and made the following remarks regarding the insatiable greed of Britain and America towards China: "Recently, the Soviet labor union publication 'War and the Working Class' contained the following statement: The hope of Britain and America is for the Soviet Union and Germany to destroy each other. After both sides fall to the ground exhausted, Britain and America will simultaneously attack, thereby easily achieving their objectives. This is a common trick of Britain and America, not limited to today, but it has recently become the most blatant. This publication holds a significant position in the Soviet public opinion sphere, and the public expression of this kind of argument is attracting widespread attention. This kind of concept from Britain and America cannot be ruled out as being applied to East Asia, such as having the two major powers of East Asia, China and Japan, fight each other in order to profit from their conflict. I have already stated this matter repeatedly, and East Asian intellectuals have all seen through this scheme. Also, recently, the British Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, revealed the implementation of the military and political organs in the Axis's occupied territories in Europe. It is said that American industrialists, in order to preserve America's investment of 176 million pounds in Europe, are attempting to seize control of European industries by taking advantage of their opposition to the Axis. As soon as British and American troops invade North Africa, they immediately take over all local mines and occupy all of its resources. This is the established plan of the American military and political organs in the occupied territories. There is no doubt that America's policies towards occupied territories in Europe will be applied to China. There is some evidence that they are attempting to gain hegemonic control over all of China's resources through loan strategies. Insatiably greedy American industrialists are now guiding the President and communist bureaucrats of their country to sacrifice themselves in battle, so that they can enslave humanity, exploit their blood and profit themselves, filling their insatiable desires."</p>

<h3>Measures to Restrict the Levy of Additional Taxes and Land Taxes</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Taxes are the financial source of the nation. However, in various provinces, cities, and counties today, various taxes are being levied under different names without prior approval, causing hardship for the people. The President of the Executive Yuan, concerned about the people's suffering, has specially instructed all provincial, city, and county governments and special administrative offices to immediately rectify taxes and establish measures to restrict the levy of taxes and additional land taxes in various provinces, cities, and counties for compliance. The original instruction and measures are copied below: To the governments of all provinces and cities, and the administrative office of the Su-Huai Special Zone: The nation's tax collection has its established principles, and special consideration should be given to alleviating the people's difficulties. Recently, it has been found that local authorities in various provinces, cities, and counties, in addition to the regular tax and approved additional levies, have used military regulations to establish new taxes under different names without prior approval, or collected additional land taxes for business subsidies and other covert means. In reality, this inevitably leads to layer upon layer of exploitation, resembling corrupt practices. There are even cases where grain is collected at prices different from official rates, and the payment of goods in kind (such as grain and wheat) is forced, resulting in diverse and confusing levies. At this time of joint participation in the war, the people's strength is already exhausted, and how can we add to the burden with more harsh and miscellaneous taxes, increasing the burden on the people? We hereby establish measures to restrict the levy of taxes and additional land taxes in various provinces, cities, and counties, ordering strict instructions to subordinates that all currently levied taxes or additional land taxes should be listed and reported to the Executive Yuan for verification and compliance. In the future, in addition to normal taxes, all additional taxes and levies must be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval before they can be levied privately, in order to rectify the situation and alleviate the people's hardship.

<p>Measures to Restrict the Levy of Taxes and Additional Land Taxes by Provincial and City Governments The Executive Yuan of the National Government formulates these measures to strictly prohibit the creation of new taxes under different names and the private levy of harsh taxes to alleviate the people's hardship. The taxes and additional land taxes collected by the collection agencies under the local governments of provinces, cities, and counties are limited to those that have been reported to and approved by the Executive Yuan.

After the promulgation of these measures, if any province, city, or county creates new taxes under different names and levies taxes without approval, it will be considered corruption. Once verified, the collectors will be handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment according to law. If chief officials of provinces, cities, and counties encounter any cases of private levy of taxes by superiors, they should immediately and strictly prohibit it and must not collude or condone it; otherwise, they will be dealt with according to the circumstances. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Mussolini Returns to Italy to Rebuild Fascist Party, with Military as Central Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Today, the Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated: After several days of meetings with the German leader, Mussolini left Germany for Italy to observe the developments there. Fascist figures hope that the new Republican Fascist Party will be fully organized internally soon. It is said that Mussolini is now concentrating his efforts on rebuilding the Fascist military and reorganizing the Fascist Party, and plans to make the Fascist military the central pillar of the new republic and the Fascist armed forces. It is still unknown whether the leader of the new Fascist government will also be the head of state or whether two people will share the roles. Currently, as a batch of Fascist political prisoners has been released continuously in the past few days, the number of senior Fascist party members under Mussolini has been increasing. However, the Reuter's report that former Foreign Minister Ciano was also rescued by the German army is not true, as Ciano is currently in another part of Italy occupied by the British and Americans, so he must be considered "missing." The same is true for former Fascist Party Secretary Storace. Fascist figures deeply regret his disappearance.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Italy Move North to Defend Naples, British and American Troops Busy Reorganizing Battle Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Because the anti-Axis forces encountered fierce counterattacks from German troops at the Salerno Bay頭, they have been actively reinforcing their forces in that area. It is reported that the British Eighth Army moving north on the Naples front has a force of 十 divisions. However, German Commander Field Marshal Kesselring has not yet deployed reserve forces to the front line, but will adjust and 金之 to counter the anti-Axis forces based on their future movements.</p>
<p>The German army issued the following statement on the battle situation on the Naples front on the afternoon of the 20th: The German troops withdrawing from Calabria and Apulia have joined the main forces south of Naples, so the battle line in that area has moved slightly north, centered on Salerno. Under the cover of naval artillery fire, the British army launched another attack on the German positions near Salerno with tank formations last weekend, but achieved no military gains. The American army made slight progress from the Battipaglia area on the 19th, and after the British Eighth Army operating south of the American Fifth Army occupied Altavilla, the speed of advance has slowed down. New anti-Axis reinforcements have landed near Castelabate and Agropoli. The anti-Axis forces' plan seems to be to secure the carrier line from Naples to Foggia, with the American Fifth Army responsible for operations in the Naples area, and the British Eighth Army responsible for the Foggia front. However, the American army has suffered heavy damage on the Salerno front, and the British Eighth Army is also fatigued from the long march north from Calabria through the mountainous area. Therefore, the battle lines must be reorganized before a general counteroffensive. The battle situation on the Naples front may enter a stalemate in the coming days. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces, relying on their naval power, are attempting to land in northern Italy. However, the German troops under Field Marshal Kesselring have established close contact with Field Marshal Rommel's northern army, so they are fully prepared for operations against the anti-Axis forces.</p>

<h3>The New Situation in Italy: Badoglio's Surrender to Germany Was Long Prepared</h3>
<p>On July 25th, when  迫  Mussolini to step down and Badoglio organized a new   , the atmosphere at the time and the subsequent situation already foreshadowed that the Badoglio regime would soon surrender to the Anglo-Americans. Indeed, Badoglio   signed the humiliating unconditional surrender treaty on September 3rd, betraying the Allied nation and selling out the motherland for a traitorous plot. The whole world deeply resented it. What was the reaction in Germany? How did Germany respond to this new situation? The world urgently wanted to know. On the night of the 9th, Asahi   聞社 made an international telephone call to Berlin correspondent Moriyama to inquire as follows: I heard that after the Badoglio regime unconditionally surrendered, what was the  響 of Germany after receiving this report? The German side had long anticipated that after Mussolini stepped down, the Badoglio regime in Italy would sooner or later make a separate peace. Therefore, its policy towards Italy was very careful in both military and political terms. Therefore, the German authorities did not regard this armistice agreement as a sudden event and were not surprised. But even though it was expected, with this kind of situation now appearing,   Germany   众 was not without considerable excitement and was greatly excited. Various German newspapers published on the 9th all used large characters   “Cowardly betrayal by Badoglio,” “Cowardly defection by Badoglio,” and the subtitles also called Badoglio “selling the Axis to the enemy,” from which it can be seen how the German side felt about the Badoglio government. Badoglio's behavior towards the Tripartite Pact violated the clause of the non-separate peace between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and vehemently denounced the cowardly behavior of the Badoglio regime.  showed Germany's  wild rage.</p>
<p>The focus of this attack on Italy was largely on Badoglio, with less attack on the King of Italy  .</p>
<p>Our newspaper: The German government must have had a plan to deal with today's new situation.</p>
<p>Moriyama: Germany's countermeasures, from the perspective of both military and political significance, are noteworthy. Generally speaking, the government is not recognizing the Badoglio government as the legitimate government from the beginning, and is taking this opportunity to recognize the previously planned national fascist forces as the legitimate government and cooperate with them in fighting to the final victory.</p>
<p>When the anti-Fascist revolution by Badoglio occurred, Germany intended to rescue 界索里尼 to Germany and establish the legitimate government of Italy, hitting down the anti-Fascist faction led by Badoglio. The German government responded cautiously, temporarily treating Badoglio as the opponent, trying to send as many troops as possible to Italy, and has already achieved substantial results.</p>
<p>The new Fascist Italian government established in northern Italy in Mussolini's name this time is   being carried out according to this policy. The central figures of Fascism are still cooperating with the Axis countries in accordance with the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Our newspaper: So now Italy can be divided into Italy on the anti-Axis side and Italy under the new Fascist Italian government.</p>
<p>Moriyama: Indeed. In the future, it can be divided into the Italian government under the control of the Anglo-Americans, which has lost its freedom, and the new Fascist government, which is loyal to the Tripartite Pact. However, there is no possibility that the Italian people will be divided into two factions and compete with each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, the peace hoped for by the Badoglio regime has not been achieved. Italy has become a battlefield in this  , and the crisis of national division has made the Italian people increasingly aware of the tragic reality.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in London, full of complacency about the surrender of the Badoglio government, claimed, "This surrender of the Badoglio government is not a peace negotiation, but a complete surrender in which the  　 body is completely destroyed. The credit for this negotiation goes to the British forces, the main force attacking Italy."</p>
<p>The Anglo-Americans' future policy towards   will kick away Badoglio and create a new liberal government, wanting to use all of Italy's land resources, industrial transportation, and other equipment without any pretense in order to fight against Germany. How much strength a divided Italy can actually contribute remains to be seen as facts develop. It is difficult to predict. Mussolini's stepping down was apparently prompted by the  nationalism of the military, centered on the country and Badoglio, so today's Italy is very different from the past. Germany, guarding the remnants of Fascism in northern Italy, cannot but fight on the southern battle緩, and its center is only German military force. German troops personally went to the front line to confront the Anglo-Americans, producing a different state of war from the previous southern front.</p>
<p>The previous situation of uncoordinated command, from a purely military standpoint, can exercise its own policies. Some German commentators explained that Germany has gained freedom of action because of the new situation.</p>
<p>Our newspaper: What are the military countermeasures? And what about the German troops inside Italy?</p>
<p>Moriyama:   The armistice agreement was signed on September 3rd between Badoglio's representative and Eisenhower's representative. On this September 3rd, the British 第入军 began the landing operation on the Italian mainland from the Calabria Peninsula. But overall, the German side had long anticipated this move, so only a few squadrons of German troops in southern  were left there, and the military damage was almost non-existent. Also, whether the Badoglio army will attack the German army or join the Anglo-American army in attacking is still unknown, but the German army seems to have been prepared for it. In short, Badoglio is a traitor who broke the Tripartite Pact. Compared with the attitude of the French government when it surrendered,  國 is even worse, flattering the Anglo-Americans. Is this the attitude of a first-class country? Therefore, Germany is very angry. (Translation from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, September 11)</p>
<h3>The Circumstances Before and After Mussolini's Escape</h3>
<p>Mussolini was rescued! This is truly shocking news. After the Badoglio government surrendered unconditionally, the Italian Fascist National Government was declared established in northern Italy, and it announced "Mussolini as commander-in-chief." But that was ultimately just "the name of Mussolini." Whereabouts of Mr. Mussolini remained unknown. Since the political upheaval in Italy, his whereabouts were unknown, and there was no definite news about his life or death. Neutral countries reported that Mussolini had been sent to North Africa to be handed over to the anti-Axis forces. German communications had also acknowledged this fact and could not deny it. However, on the 10th, the German Headquarters announced that German paratroopers had rescued Mussolini, which was truly a miracle. No one who heard this news was likely to remain untroubled. After receiving   report, the Asahi Shimbun immediately connected to Berlin correspondent Moriyama on the night of the 12th to inquire about the state of encouragement in Germany. Here is what correspondent Moriyama had to say:</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: Mussolini's safe rescue is a remarkable and noteworthy miracle. The Japanese side is also being influenced by it. The German side must be very excited about this dramatic event!</p>
<p>Correspondent Moriyama: The German headquarters issued a special announcement on the night of August 12th that Mussolini, who had been imprisoned by the Badoglio regime, had been rescued by German paratroopers and other commandos just before he was about to be handed over to the anti-Axis forces in North Africa. This is the most dramatic event in this war since the Hess incident. The Axis front naturally felt a surge, even the enemy was greatly shaken. Especially in Germany, in the past one or two months, there have been a series of unpleasant events such as the landing in Sicily, Badoglio's betrayal, and Italy's separate peace, which have greatly dampened the people's spirits. The news of Mussolini's return, with millions of friendly troops regaining the southern battlefield, was hailed by German media. According to the announcement of the Badoglio government at that time, Mussolini's stepping down was not carried out through legal constitutional procedures. The German government, anticipating the anti-Fascist coup by the king and the military, secretly proceeded with   plan to rescue Mr. Mussolini himself to   country from the moment the Badoglio government appeared. However, the Badoglio faction knew that if Mussolini went to Germany, the Fascist and German reactions would deal a fatal blow to their own fate. Therefore, they repeatedly   changed the location where Mr. Mussolini was imprisoned, to confuse German espionage. Finally, they learned that he was imprisoned on Ponza Island in the Gulf of Gaeta. With Hitler's character and style, if Mr. Mussolini had been in Germany at that time, he would never have recognized the Badoglio government, which clearly intended to make a separate peace. He would have regarded the Mussolini government as legitimate and set about overthrowing the one who dared to betray   . Although Germany worked hard to explore and manage in every possible way, they were ultimately successful. After the armistice agreement was concluded, the general consensus was that the attempt to rescue Mr. Mussolini had failed. German officials   officially announced: "Mussolini was arrested by the Badoglio government, and the Badoglio government   rooted   with the agreement concluded with the enemy, he will  hand over Mr. Mussolini to the Anglo-Americans." Foreign Ministry's Schmitt, the head of information, also stated at a press conference: "The fact that Mussolini was handed over to the Anglo-American forces in North Africa has become undeniable." and they believed that all the efforts of the German side would be in vain. In his speech on the 10th, Hitler referred to "my blood-sworn friend Mussolini," and praised his personality in the best terms. This can be interpreted as   Mr. Mussolini's" farewell to those. The German people's hatred for the Badoglio faction's betrayal was   seen to be rising and  fierce. But the day after Hitler gave this speech  Mr. Mussolini was rescued by Germany. Although it has not yet been clearly announced where the German paratroopers were and how they rescued Mr. Mussolini, this is a heartening scene that decorates the end of the hateful Badoglio's defection.

<h3>Grain Control Commission Actively Preparing, Established Around End of Month, Taking Over Rice Distribution from October</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the government issued an appointment to establish the Rice and Grain Control Commission for food-related organizations. After repeatedly convening committees and relevant Japanese agencies, it has decided on a rice purchase and sale organization plan. It is now actively engaged in preparations, but due to the failure to find a suitable location for the commission, the preparatory office has been temporarily established at the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce to handle preparatory matters. As for the internal organizational structure and personnel, it has not yet been specifically determined. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the person in charge of the preparatory office, the commission is still in preparation for the following reasons:  The preparation time is tight and preparations could not be completed in time;  The location of the temporary office at the City Chamber of Commerce is problematic because the City Chamber of Commerce's general meeting of members is scheduled for the 26th of this month and the office location cannot be determined for the time being;  The candidates for the heads of various departments and divisions have not yet been fully determined. Therefore, the date of establishment is at the latest around the end of this month.</p>
<p>Shanghai News says that it is heard from well-informed sources that the Executive Yuan recently ordered the National General Administration of Commercial Control to direct the Rice and Grain Control Commission to take over the rice and grain production, sales, control, and distribution matters starting in October. After receiving the order, the Grain Control Commission, whose own organization is still in the preparatory stage, is seeking to be formally established in the shortest possible time. Therefore, it reported to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the files and records of past grain administration and the rice and grain warehouses be handed over to the Commission to unify the procedures. On the other hand, it is accelerating the completion of the internal organization in preparation for undertaking the grain control work. It is reported that the Grain Control Commission has already been working in the City Chamber of Commerce, and under the director and secretary, it is divided into four divisions: general affairs, finance, procurement and transportation, and storage and distribution, each division with three or four sections. As for the addition of deputy directors, it was originally planned for one, but now the possibility of two is greater, perhaps one each from the Chinese and Japanese sides will be appointed. The candidates have already been internally determined and are expected to be announced within days.</p>

<h3>Rationed Sugar Sold on the Black Market: Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Biscuit factories, candy stores, and bakeries are suspected of selling large amounts of their monthly sugar rations on the black market instead of using them to manufacture biscuits and other sugary food products. Local authorities have stopped allocating supplies to these businesses and have launched an investigation. It is reported that biscuit factories, candy stores, bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, and nightclubs receive 30 to 40 packages of sugar (each package weighing 220 pounds) per month at official prices. In reality, only about 25% of this sugar is used for manufacturing sugary foods, while the remaining 75% is sold on the black market. Therefore, the authorities have launched a thorough investigation. If the authorities can stop allocating sugar to all biscuit factories, candy stores, bakeries, restaurants, coffee shops, and nightclubs, or reduce the monthly sugar ration, it is hoped that the sugar ration for general households can be increased.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Supply Has Not Returned to Normal: Retailers Will Petition for Improvement</h3>

The subsidy was originally scheduled to be disbursed starting in August, but was delayed due to the reorganization of the Municipal Education Association. Now that the Municipal Education Association has been reorganized and established, private schools eagerly hope that the authorities will quickly realize the plan to distribute subsidies, which will greatly benefit teachers and students.</p>

<h3>Donghua vs. Jiangsu-Anhui Football Teams: Jiangsu-Anhui Returns North Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Anhui Expedition Football Team played against Donghua again at Yiyuan yesterday. This was an extra match beyond the original schedule. Football fans flocked to it, and Yiyuan was full before 5:00 PM. Those who arrived later were still coming in droves. The order inside the field was almost impossible to maintain. It was impossible to do so, so the iron gate was pulled, the soldiers of the Jiangsu-Anhui troops were also expanded outside the gate, and there was no door to enter. Later, the Public Concession Bureau transferred a large number of detectives from the Medical Bureau before opening the small iron gates at both Albert Road and Lafayette Road. The visiting team did not enter the arena until after six o'clock. The match began at 6:15.</p>
<p>Three to One</p>
<p>The result of the match was Donghua winning 3-1. Donghua took the lead 2-0 in the first half. The Jiangsu-Anhui team had Yan Renkuan playing goalkeeper and Yao Baozhen playing right winger. After a long stalemate, neither side scored. More than 20 minutes later, Youliang hooked the ball in and Li Yao headed it. Just as it fell in front of the goal, A Jie welcomed it with a kick. Lao Yan lay on the ground to block it, but did not get far. Li Qing turned to save it, but accidentally sent it into the corner of the net, resulting in an own goal. Only three minutes apart, Li Yao made a sharp advance, and A Dai lightly passed the center. Sun Jin headed it and it fell right into the open space. The match was shortened to 30 minutes, and Donghua led 2-0 in the first half. When the two teams met again, Donghua's Liang Shuye retired. Liao Shiming was transferred to the back, and Youliang's nephew, Chen Mingkun, supplemented the wing. After a fierce battle for a long time, Yao Changzhen pulled back a goal. Before long, the nephew passed to the uncle, Youliang headed successfully. By this time, the twilight was vast, and thousands of lights were lit. Donghua finally won 3-1. The Jiangsu-Anhui army returned to Xuzhou tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Commentary: The Backbone of Farmers</h3>
<p>Although agriculture is not the only source of wealth for a country, the source of a country's wealth cannot be said to not largely rely on agriculture. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Because what is most worrying in wartime is the lack of food. Therefore, how to plan for the comprehensive increase in food production is the focus of discussion at today's provincial and municipal food increase conferences.</p>
<p>The physiocratic school of thought in the history of economic thought believes that only labor used in agriculture can generate surplus, and that farmers' surplus can increase family wealth. China has traditionally been established as an agricultural country, and has a special advantage in agricultural production. Undoubtedly, China's production undertaking will still focus on agriculture, and China's farmers can be called the "backbone" of the production class.</p>
<p>The two departments of food and industry proposed in the food increase conference to establish "Core Farmer Training Classes" in cooperatives in various places, in order to increase production, and have recently begun to prepare everything in order to quickly advance. The so-called "core farmers" are the backbone of the farmers. To cultivate such a backbone, it is necessary to cultivate "their understanding of the relationship between agriculture and national welfare, their interest in improving farming methods, their knowledge of increasing the actual amount of agriculture, their enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland and wasteland, and their practical responsibility for transforming rural life." The training of "core farmers" should at least include the basic topics listed above, so that they can become an elite force and a cadre in China's agricultural production sector, and its realization depends on the continuous efforts of the food and industry authorities!</p>
<h3>Circular from the Silver and Money Industry to Banks and Firms: Savings Deposits Should Pay Reserves, the Ministry Determines to Entrust the Central Reserve Bank to Handle</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association has issued a circular to member banks and firms regarding the payment of security reserves for savings deposits and its methods: "To the esteemed members, We have recently received Order Qian 2 No. 287 from the Ministry of Finance stating that the payment of security reserves for savings deposits is stipulated in Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law. All payment methods have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for revision and were announced and implemented by the Ministry on August 3rd this year. In addition to separate instructions, we are urgently sending the aforementioned methods for your association to follow and to forward to the member banks and firms for compliance. This is the order," and attached a copy of the "Methods for Paying Security Reserves for Savings Deposits." We will separately convey and attach the aforementioned methods, and hope that you will investigate and comply with them. We now extract its payment methods as follows:</p>
<p>Payment Methods</p>
<p>In order to implement the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, the Ministry of Finance entrusts the Central Reserve Bank to collect security reserves for savings deposits and is responsible for the sale of inspection and custody. The security reserve for savings deposits should be at least one-fourth of the total amount of savings deposits in government bonds and other assets with guaranteed certainty. The deposit amount stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the total balance at the end of each half year. The Central Reserve Bank may, when necessary, hire experts to assess the value of various guarantees of the security reserve. In addition to paying security reserves, the Ministry of Finance may at any time entrust the Central Reserve Bank to inspect its business, content, and the actual situation of all its assets. Savings banks may apply to exchange guarantees of the same value at the end of each month. If the value of the above guarantees fluctuates too much, the Central Reserve Bank may order the savings bank to make up the difference or return the excess. The Central Reserve Bank shall submit a list of the security reserves deposited by the savings bank at the end of each month to the Ministry of Finance for future reference. These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Industry Requests: Open the Market for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes</h3>
<p>The market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes in this city has been closed for the winter. It is learned that yesterday a group of oil and grain traders, feeling that the buying and selling outside the market was chaotic and that real sales customers often found it difficult to purchase, jointly requested the industry association to restore and open the market to concentrate transactions. However, the association authorities stated that they still need to discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>Hua Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks opened a new page. In a quiet sound, the bidding wind started, re-invigorating the hearts of all parties that had been sluggish for more than 500 days. According to reporters' inquiries from all parties, the main reasons are roughly three: (1) The silver shop industry's transfer of funds has reached two weeks, with little use, resulting in the recent resumption of lending. (2) Since the financial stocks launched a buying spree, the financial and industrial circles of this city, who have been thinking diligently for a long time, first started with the new medicine and department store stocks, and absorbed huge amounts. (3) The reaction that should have occurred after people's hearts have been tired for more than a month. Therefore, stocks in various industries have generally risen. In the new medicine industry, a certain household in the French Pharmacy exclusively entered more than 10,000 shares, causing great excitement; New Asia was also strongly supported by large households, and the price of New Star Pharmaceutical Factory was also firm; Five Continents, Chinese and Western, Sino-British, and Star Perfume were more stable. The Yong'an Company in the department store industry rose particularly sharply, rapidly crossing two levels in the morning and afternoon, and the increase did not return; Xin Xin, Guohuo, and Chinese Underwear were originally seen to be evenly matched in the morning, but also began to record Mang in the afternoon. Jingfu Socks and Shirts are still in high demand and rising again; the buying wind for Jinglun new shares has also started, in the textile industry, Yong'an Textile rose sharply in the afternoon, the increase was nearly level; Dasheng's one or three factories have few transactions and prices have also been raised in the afternoon, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Qingfeng Textile, Wuhe Hongxing Hongsheng Dazhong although weaving is stable, Rongfeng Textile continued to rise. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press slightly declined, China World Yongxiang Printing were all flat; Standard Paper Products slightly rose. Da Zhonghua Matches went straight up all the way, Nanyang Tobacco Company also rose, while Huacheng was tired and falling. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity was low, and Huashang Electric was stable. The industrial stock Jiu'an rose back to the level. Da Zhonghua and Xinghua Industrial Labor Products are strong and stable; the transaction price of New Asia Construction is also slightly higher. In the real estate industry, Xin Yi Lianhua Yongfeng originally saw small matches in the morning, but also rose back in the afternoon. Kangyuan slightly declined: Bao'an Glass, Huafeng Enamel, and Dahua Fenghua opened at the price on the left on the previous day. The financial industry is still rising steadily. New highs appeared in the various bureaus of the Mainland, Shanghai Silver, Zhejiang Zhuan, Jincheng, and China Credit Trust.</p>
<p>Business Summary</p>
<p>Government Bonds The opening price yesterday was small, because it did not fall despite the unfavorable afternoon, and has not improved. It is still a kind of sigh that it is restrained and does not stretch. The price of C-grade is hovering, and the final step is lower than the previous day. A-grade is close to E-grade, and B and D grades are both weak.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain The amount of rice arriving at the market by land and water has decreased. After the initial leveling of sporadic Yunlu, the market has become active. New Geng and various goods from Jilin have been hindered, and Baiyuan is also slightly firm. In the end, the result of the calling price is still trending downward because of the sluggishness of miscellaneous grains, oil, and beans.</p>
<p>Tea The situation from morning to market closing was finally in a dull and flat situation. Buyers' stomachs were still weak, and prices did not rise or fall much compared to last week. The entire city was buying 22 loads of Qiqiang green tea, and Rixin Tea Office was pointing to 8 loads of red tea and 10 loads of green tea, which were sold by Rongchang Li Da Tea Bank.</p>
<p>Wool After the middle of last month, affected by the environment, various goods have successively fallen in price. The beginning of this month was particularly steep. Xinfu Rentai took the lead in reducing prices to pay back. In recent days, a boatload of storefronts have also reduced prices and sold cheaply, because their black market has long been invisible, and the wholesale market price has already fallen within the price limit by nine out of ten. Wholesale is still lacking, so the various shops in the chessboard street have already started to sell cheaply.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Ningbo and Bengbu Branches of Finance: Prepare to Establish Within This Week</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, since it has concluded the inspection of financial institutions in the special urban area of Shanghai, has actively promoted financial inspection in the interior. In addition to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Hankou and other places, branches have been established to handle the financial inspection business of financial institutions in accordance with the interim measures for managing financial institutions and the detailed rules for implementation. The Ningbo and Bengbu branches, which have been planned to be established recently, have been limited to preparing for establishment within this week and starting inspection work.</p>
<h3>Budding Era Nursery Movement (Continued)</h3>
<p>Reasonable Education</p>
<p>Entering the gate of a Shanghai nursery, the beautiful chickens in the small flowerbeds stir up a small commotion. The wooden horses and slides in the front courtyard corridor give people a vivid impression. From the front should come the sound of teaching, it turns out that more than thirty children in the kindergarten class are in class! Although in the classroom, the children also talk and laugh with the teacher, like with their own mothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Director Bian said that their establishment of the nursery has four major principles for the children's education, which are the so-called "Fourizations":</p>
<p>1.  Popularization: The children admitted all come from poor families, and after leaving the nursery in the future, they will also return to poor families, so they must be accustomed to simplicity, plainness, and cleanliness in the nursery, and especially pay attention to personal and public hygiene and morality.</p>
<p>2.  Scientification: In terms of management, whether it is daily life and diet, the furniture and equipment used in the nursery, such as tables, chairs, and toys, or in terms of affairs, such as the distribution of nanny work, and accounts, etc., are strictly required to be systematized, and to conform to the principles of division of labor and cooperation, saving manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>3.  Education: Implement the new educational theory of "life is education, education is life", so that children from an early age can learn various life experiences from the teachers, nannies, playmates, and toys in the nursery, especially to make the children accustomed to a collective, educational, and disciplined life in the nursery.</p>
<p>4.  Familiarization: In the nursery, there are many children who cannot see their parents for several months or even years, but the healthy personality development of each child cannot be without parental love! Therefore, the women strive to make the atmosphere of the nursery avoid being institutionalized. From the nannies to the teachers, they should be as loving as the kind mothers of each child. Children can also obtain great maternal love in the nursery, and it is social, unbiased, and non-indulgent maternal love, which cultivates a correct outlook on life in the new era, and its significance is even greater.</p>
<p>The children in the nursery are now divided into four groups. More than thirty children over three years old are in Group A, and are given some elementary kindergarten education. The rest, two to three years old, are in Group B, one to two years old are in Group C, mainly with appropriate games and singing, taking advantage of opportunities to train their automatic abilities. In addition, those under one year old are in Group D. In principle, education and nurturing are equally important, but for children under four years old, they do not focus on reading and literacy. They only give them an excellent learning environment, so that they are accustomed to self-help (such as washing their hands, washing their faces, and dressing themselves) and mutual assistance and cooperation. This kind of ideal training requires sincere love and patience.</p>
<p>Fragment of Life</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the nursery is already bustling with activity. The nannies have to take care of the children getting up, having breakfast, playing games, and the nurses have to prepare to check the children's health status. The teachers also have to study what newer and more effective teaching methods there are. The whole morning, it is said, is the busiest time of day.</p>
<p>The children's meals are generally soy milk and porridge for breakfast every day. At noon, Groups A and B eat rice, with one meat dish and two vegetarian dishes, mainly hot eggs and pig liver. Sometimes they buy some pork bones to make soup. Group C and below mainly eat porridge and vegetable puree. At three o'clock in the afternoon, they have a snack once, mostly biscuits, bread, and soy milk. In the evening, it is porridge or noodles. Generally speaking, the nutrition is sufficient. For those who feel deficient, they are given special supplements. For economic reasons, the staff's meals cannot be as elaborate as the children's. No wonder the children in the nursery all look very lively, especially the few infants, white and chubby, how cute. However, Director Bian said that because milk powder is so hard to come by, Group D, that is, infants under one year old, now have to stop accepting them.</p>
<p>The children's clothes are partly made by the nursery with specially purchased cloth, some are uniform styles, and most are donated by various sectors of society. Many enthusiastic ladies donate cloth or sew them for them, which solves a major part of their clothing problem. One cannot but be happy for the children. However, recently there have been very few donors. If new clothes are to be made at the turn of autumn and winter, there is probably no hope. The children's bedrooms are all on the second and third floors, not only is the air fresh and the light adequate, but there are also exquisite small iron beds. It is said that there are fifty frames purchased when they were first established. Today, it would probably cost over one thousand yuan per frame. In addition, some of the older children temporarily borrow the adult steel beds from the Young Women's Christian Association dormitory, and several infants are using the exquisite small iron beds from the Tongren Hospital. In addition, there are also specially made short-legged canvas beds. All these beds have uniform white bedding and tulle mosquito nets. Every bedroom is very tidy, clean, and beautiful!</p>
<p>Nurturing Him to Grow Up</p>
<p>In the old days, abandoning a child in an orphanage because one could not afford to raise them was a tragedy for the family and even for life, and one could never see one's own child again! However, now being able to send a child to a nursery has become the greatest fortune for the family and even for life. The child receives more considerate and reasonable care than at home, and will bring a healthy body and mind and unparalleled joy to their parents in the future!</p>
<p>In addition to education, children in the nursery are also protected in terms of health. On weekdays, twenty-four hours a day, there is not an hour that people are not responsible for taking care of them. This is almost impossible for any family to do! The two nurses, the head nurse, graduated from Huzhou Gospel Hospital and served in Peking Union Medical College Hospital for a long time. The other nurse also has rich experience in pediatric medical care. They take turns day and night to take charge of the nursery's medication and hygiene work. The nursery also has the assistance of Tongren No. 1 Hospital and the Red Cross Society. Whether it is a doctor visiting the nursery or sending them to the hospital for treatment, no fees are charged, and medicines are also allowed to be calculated at half price. In case of infectious diseases, they are sent to the former Public Works Bureau Isolation Hospital. However, due to effective prevention and treatment and good nutrition, it is said that since its establishment, not only has there been no deaths, but also there have not been many illnesses. They not only pay attention to the diseases on the children's bodies, but also pay attention to the cleanliness of the entire nursery. All the houses are diligently cleaned, and clothes are disinfected on time. Towels and basins are used separately by each person. As soon as there is a sick child, they are immediately moved to a specially prepared room. Now there are two small rooms on the second floor, where three children with diseases are isolated and treated from other children. Under the considerate care, all the children in the nursery are very healthy and lively.</p>
<p>The children's caregivers - the workers in the nursery, in terms of organization, belong to a certain Christian Young Women's Association. They have specially set up a Shanghai Nursery Committee, and hired one chairman and several members as the highest authority of the nursery. All the actual work is the responsibility of the director, who is Ms. Bian Xusun, a staff member of the Young Women's Christian Association. She is very modest and unwilling to disclose her past brilliant academic qualifications and experience, but in the cause of nurseries, from initiating the establishment, preparing, and administering to running the nursery, she alone takes on all the administrative, clerical, accounting, general affairs, and public relations work, which has fully demonstrated her correct understanding of the cause of transforming society, her spirit of sacrifice and service, and her ability to handle affairs.</p>
<p>The work in the nursery is busy and hard, and in order to give each child meticulous care, there must be more caretakers. There are now fourteen nannies, most of whom are graduates of the Young Women's Christian Association's short-term nanny training class, and have received at least six months of training, knowing the responsibility and skills of caring for young children. There are also a few who have served as assistant nurses in major hospitals, and also have medical appreciation. In addition to taking turns resting for half a day each week, they are really working hard day and night. Whenever they have free time, they take the opportunity to discuss and study ways to improve their work, "working without forgetting to learn". The educational work of kindergarten students is the responsibility of a head teacher who graduated from Suzhou Jinghai Kindergarten Teacher's School, and there is also an assistant teacher. Because "teaching and care are combined", their work is not easy either! There are four workers, two women doing laundry, washing diapers, and cooking, very busy, and two men, from internal affairs to external affairs, also have to grind soy milk. It is not easy to get free time either.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the caregivers are great and the affairs are numerous, but their treatment is unexpectedly meager - in addition to providing accommodation, two congee and one rice per day and one and a half yuan for meals (three yuan for children), the nannies only receive one hundred yuan per month, and the nurses only three hundred yuan and four hundred yuan. The director does not even draw a salary from the nursery, in order to reduce the nursery's expenses. From this, it can be seen that they are completely embracing the spirit of sacrificing service! How can one not be impressed?</p>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>On Expert Politics</h3>
<p>— By Lan Sheng</p>
<p>What is an expert? This needs to be explained in today's Chinese society. The so-called expert naturally has specialized knowledge. One has in-house (industry, experience, if broadly speaking, are all considered experts, narrowly speaking, only refers to the former, that is, experts with specialized knowledge. In more detail, the former is a specialist who comes from a specialized school and enters the workplace of the learned profession without any work experience, and the other is not from a specialized school, but because he has worked in the industry for many years, he has acquired knowledge that others cannot "fully know and fully understand". Such talents are also very useful.</p>
<p>In today's Chinese society, there are very few of the first type of experts, and there are quite a few of the second type of experts. The need in society is naturally still for the first type of experts. The reason why Chinese society cannot produce many of the first type of experts is not the failure of the education system, but rather the political and social factors. "Graduation means unemployment" and "studying is not applied" are due to the shortcomings of Chinese politics and society. Personnel in politics and society are mostly based on feudal relationships and are selected based on likes and dislikes, so China cannot produce first-class experts, but can only produce second-class experts. However, the so-called in-house experts cannot be true specialists. It is enough to compliment them as experienced experts.</p>
<p>China needs experts, even more so in politics. Politics is the leader of everything in society. If politics is not expert politics, then everything in Chinese society cannot develop, and the restoration of China is even more out of the question.</p>
<p>What we know is that Japan can be considered expert politics. The Japanese civil service system, from apprentice to subordinate official, administrative official, director-general, to political official, all have strict laws on qualification, promotion, demotion, transfer, and personnel rewards and punishments. The key point of the Japanese civil service system lies in the division between administrative officials and political officials. Administrative officials must come according to the order of promotion, and their position is guaranteed from being affected by political tides, so that they can serve with peace of mind. Political officials are not. They can have relative freedom of will and action in terms of resignation and reinstatement due to political stance. Administrative officials handle affairs, while political officials handle politics. If the political officials' views no longer align with the political doctrines, systems, or factions due to cabinet reshuffles or political changes, then they naturally resign. In this way, the politics of a country can continue to progress without affecting the people's lives.</p>
<p>However, in China, it is not the same. When political officials fall, administrative officials and even lower-level staff are also dismissed, which affects social undertakings and people's lives. This is very serious. This is not to say that when a new official takes office, he orders the dismissal of all the old staff. Some also automatically resign, the so-called "martyrdom" and "advancing and retreating together". This kind of "foolish loyalty" is not allowed in civilized countries, because officials are public servants, serving the country, not being loyal to individuals. Those who only know individuals and do not know the country are remnants of the feudal system. Chinese political officials often do not have time to consider this when they take office. The so-called "studying is not applied," and they make personnel decisions based on likes and dislikes, the so-called "even the chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." When they step down, their subordinates are naturally fearful, and the so-called "when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter."</p>
<p>Comparing the civil service systems of China and Japan, Japan can naturally produce more experts, and can be said to be expert politics. Under the above-mentioned situation in China, not only cannot it produce many experts, but even the few existing experts may not be able to obtain positions where they can apply what they have learned. Those with weak wills may also give up on themselves. It simply destroys experts, and there is no way to talk about expert politics.</p>
<p>The so-called "scholars ruin the country" and "scholars revolt," etc., are the clichés of society's distrust of expert politics. There may be such things in Chinese politics, but we believe that there is still a need for consideration. A temporary strongman, such as Liu Bang, often disdained scholars and humiliated them to the extreme. After he became emperor, he even asked Shusun Tong to create "court etiquette" for the concubines. Zhuge Liang's three visits to Liu Bei is even more well known. Zhuge Liang "compared himself to Guan Zhong and Yue Yi," and was still young at the time and may not have had political experience, but he was able to greatly expand his ambitions in Shu and overwhelm the old official Fa Zheng. Therefore, it is said that "scholars revolt" may "fail", but "a scholar ruins the country" is "not necessarily."</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, there was once a cabinet of scholars around the first decade of the Republic of China. At that time, the president was Dr. Wang Daxie, the finance minister was Zhou Zigan, and the foreign minister was Gu Weijun and Wen Erhe, etc. Most of the cabinet members were doctors, so people called it the "scholar cabinet," and some ridiculed it as the "pedantic cabinet." Later, Wu Jinglian, a bureaucrat, instigated the case of the Golden Franc and slandered Luo Wengan. However, Dr. Wang Daxie protested to the president in his capacity as acting prime minister, "rejecting the constitution." In this incident, it was a small matter that Dr. Wang and others did not lose their true nature, but it was no small feat to maintain the unification and save political integrity. In the evolution of the political arena over the past twenty years, the bureaucrat Wu Jinglian eventually perished because he was not tolerated by heaven and earth (as he sighed in Baoding). Compared to Wang, Luo, and others, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Hu Shi once advocated a "good person politics." This kind of idealism may refer to political officials. On the administrative official side, we must at least advocate "expert administration". The so-called "expert administration" may be considered too idealistic and impractical by the general public. First, China does not have many "experts," and the few "experts" are also "political corrupt experts," which are still undesirable. However, for the sake of the country's long-term plan, the qualification and guarantee of administrative officials are matters of utmost urgency. In this way, we can achieve the ideal of the so-called "expert administration."</p>
<p>In view of the current political personnel problems and the shortage of expert talents, the author has tried to discuss the above. I wonder what the world thinks?</p>
<h3>Opinions on Organizing a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jiang Shouting proposed organizing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, people from all walks of life have expressed their support and expressed their opinions. I have read these many articles in recent days and also have good feelings in my heart. I respectfully contribute some of my humble opinions as follows.</p>
<p>First of all, there is a question that seems unimportant to the organization of the cooperative itself, but must be paid attention to. It is said that Chinese educational thought has always been influenced by British and American romantic liberalism, so some people have long advocated "educational independence." This time, in the details of Mr. Jiang's proposal to organize a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, one of the positions even advocated that "the cooperative is absolutely independent and has no relationship with politics" (the general idea is like this). In fact, education itself is a part of politics. How can it be independent from politics? Take the organization of the cooperative, for example. In the future, after its establishment, for economic loans, the dredging of loan sources, and the convenience of transportation, etc., it will all need to seek help from government agencies and borrow some political power in order to proceed smoothly. Although Mr. Jiang is probably also aware of these things, what he means by "independence and no relationship with politics" probably refers to the fact that the organization of the cooperative has no political nature and does not interfere in politics, so as to avoid causing other unnecessary troubles. However, this statement has a grammatical error, so I specially bring it up.</p>
<p>As for other points:</p>
<p>Economic fund-raising. The share price may as well be temporarily set at one hundred yuan per share. Each person must subscribe for at least one share. Middle school teachers and university professors are in a higher position and have more ability than elementary school teachers. Naturally, they should subscribe for more shares. It is best for middle school teachers to subscribe for two shares each, and university professors to subscribe for four shares each. In addition to raising funds publicly from all sectors of society, there are now regulations in the National Banks for lending to cooperatives, so they can borrow from the banks.</p>
<p>Also, all levels of schools can set up public shares and join under the name of the school. Mr. Jiang advocates collecting funds from students and parents, but this matter involves too much and will definitely be difficult to implement. It can be omitted.</p>
<p>Investigation and distribution. These two matters are closely related and must strive for fairness. The scope of the family should be limited to the person's direct ascendants and wife, siblings, and children. However, among them, in addition to the wife, all family members who are young men and women aged twenty to forty-five, if there are no special circumstances, such as disability, unemployment, etc., should also be excluded and cannot enjoy rations. Otherwise, large families will definitely benefit, and with a large number of people, the rations may be insufficient, which is a big impact.</p>
<p>Talent recruitment. Now, for everything, it can be said that seven points rely on relationships and three points rely on laws. Talent is the most important, because only with people can all organizational systems take effect. In the future, after the cooperative is established, there will be many difficulties in terms of fundraising, purchasing goods, transportation, rationing, etc. Especially in the matter of purchasing goods, in the current era of backward production and lack of materials, and everything is not rationalized, if the person in charge does not have considerable connections with government agencies and industrial and commercial circles, then the things you want to buy will definitely be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the person in charge of the cooperative is the most important. The criteria for selecting them are not only to be shrewd and capable, honest and impartial, but also to be able to handle things smoothly.</p>
<p>Hopes should not be too high. I am currently working in a cooperative in the countryside. Based on my experience, I feel that the rations of the current generation of cooperatives are absolutely not free. Sometimes the items needed cannot be rationed, and what they can ration is not very much needed. Therefore, I first tell everyone that you should not have too high hopes for cooperatives. The real way for our teachers, soldiers, and farmers to solve the difficulties in their lives is to increase their salaries.</p>

<h3>Longhua Benevolent Society Donates Paper Notebooks and Medicines</h3>
<p>The Longhua Benevolent Society has been established for seven years. Over the years, it has distributed effective medicines, throat pain powder, etc., as well as a kind of all-healing Tongling Puji Dan, which is transferred to various provincial branches through the World Red Cross Society. Each year, about 700,000 doses are needed, but the number of people seeking medicine this year is several times more than in previous years. Now, in order to support this newspaper's student loan movement for poor students, the Society has specially donated 300 proverb-printed notebooks, instructing to distribute them to middle school students, and 500 doses of Tongling Puji Dan, instructing to send them to the poor.
