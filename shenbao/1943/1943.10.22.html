<p>社評</p>
<h3>貢獻於米統會當局</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會近正積極推進工作，十九日在滬召開各地區米糧採辦同業公會籌備委員會議。接着舉行懇談會，交換採辦意見。廿一日叉舉行各地區正副主任聯席會議。</p>
<p>我們始終感覺辦理糧政，不但要精明仔細，而且還要敏捷淸脆。糊塗疏忽迂緩牽絲都要不得。米糧統制委員會已經筹備逾月，實際工作尙待展開，對於時間上的敏捷，我們盼望該會當局以及各地區代表還須勉力爭取。尤其是經過這幾次會談以後，進入實際工作的階段。</p>
<p>米糧統制委員會的工作，約略可分為三節，　採辦，　運轉，　配給。當然，三者之間都極重耍，不可偏廢。不過，運轉與配給，是居於從屬地位，因為採辦以後，才有運轉，才有配給。運轉與配給的能力方法，縱是高超，仍須仰賴採辦得力，才可發揮。所以，採辦工作母篝說是居於主要地位。這次各地區米糧採辦同業公會代表，都是負有採辦的重大使命，能够事先聚首一堂，彼此交換意見，交換經騐，對於今後米糧採辦工作的技術與方法，應當有理想的進步。所以，我們對於道次各地區正副主任的聯席會議，特別寄其殷切的期待，盼望大家切切實實遵守議定的辦法，為採辦工作努力。本來，官塲中的會議，因為很多敷衍門面的事實發生，就有「會而不議，議而不決，決而不行，行而不力」的譏刺。現在米糧統制委員會是商業自治性團體，各地區採辦同業公會代表又是商界巨子，我們盼望力矯官塲會議的積習，而發抓商人自治的精神，特別注重「決而行，行而力」。米糧採辦工作，也許一地還有一地的特殊情形，無論貨價的規定，糧質的區別，儲藏的妥愼，這些在常地商人憑藉經騐去辦理，必能合理的適應，我們於此在原則上貢獻管見者，無非期待各地代表充分瞭解民食的重要，政府組織米統會的旨趣，以及本身職責的艱巨，而精細敏捷的全力辦理，幫助米統會成功，就是幫助國家糧政的成功。</p>
<p>此外，糧食部米糧採銷總管理處現巳撤銷，我們尙有兩點意見，貢獻於米統會當局注意：</p>
<p>第一，過去糧食部建築的各地儲糧倉庫，正為今後米統會各地採辦米糧的儲藏之所。儘量接收利用。倉庫中原有米糧，一併移交，統盤保存，儲藏方法，原則上務須不被霉蛀，保持良好素質。</p>
<p>第二，過去糧食部米糧採銷處職工中，不無技術專家，米統會應甄選錄用，使無遺才。</p>
<p>糧食部原為政府專辦糧政的機構，米糧統制委員會，是政府指定組織的商業自治性機構，是半官性的官督商辦機構，彼此之間的工作，雖有移轉，而共同目標却一樣是調節民食。在糧食部與米統會看來，也許各有職責，而在我們看來，却是同一步驟。我們讀了二十日報載米糧採銷總管理處結束業務，糧食部負責人發表談話，「糧部為顧全大局，原自十月份起應由米統會負責配給，因該會迭請繼續維持，兼以各方關心，故暫維現狀，惟望米統會從速開始收買，接續辦理配給事宜，使民食軍糧不致閒斷。」糧食部對於米統會，尙如此期待，那來，我們更加迫切的盼望糧統會迅速擔當使命。趁此各地區代表集滬之時，敢以奉獻諸君，勉力完成調節民食的重大任務！</p>
<h3>整頓華中鐵道交通</h3>
<p>今天報載，華中鐵道當局，積極整頓路政。創立鐵道學院，訓練從業員工。派員往華北滿洲國等地，調査鐵路敎育施政狀况，以資參攷。我們對於華中鐵道當局重視交通，整頓路政，表示欣佩。不過，創立學院，訓練職工，僅僅是整頓路政的一端，而在時間上失之　緩，未　把目前鐵道交通上的缺點，立時矯正。因為訓練職工，第一必須經過相當時間；第二不可能全體受訓。我們不是說訓練職工目前並不需要，而是說目前整頓路政，要求有圓滿的成績，應該從多方面加以澈底調整。斟酌緩急，定其先後，確立計劃，嚴格執行。才足以言整頓的效果。</p>
<p>廿六年以前，京滬滬杭兩路客運之多，為全國各鐵路冠，職工人數之多與路綫長度比例，亦為全國各鐵路冠，兩路職工共有一萬餘人，當然，事實上難免良莠不齊，但因當局嚴密規定人事制度，人事法規，賞罰獎懲，悉依法則，不徇私情，嚴格執行。因而造成良好法紀的　境，雖有不良分子亦無所施其伎倆，益以不斷的精神訓練，使券者亦漸漸學為良者，克收移風轉俗之效。彼時兩路交通，秩序井然，行旅稱便，其功績當然是全體職工的努力服務所致，然而常局的督導於上，殷發求整頓之精神，尤足稱道。</p>
<p>今日的華中鐵道公司，所轄路綫，不止京滬滬杭兩路，在職員工，僅吾國人巳達三萬人，佔全體五分之三，誠然，因錄用太濫，分子複雜，管理上頗感困難。不過，我們認為整頓的焦點，不在於客觀上因為人數多而濫，分子複而雜，即不易着手，難於收效。而在於當局者有否決心？有否誠意？有否毅力？如果有了決心誠意毅力，然後從嚴密人事制度入手，規定賞罰法規，嚴格執行，尤其是中高級幹部職工，不令不良份子潛跡，以身作則，雷厲風行，深信稍假時日，不難弊絕風淸，為旅客謀便利。今之選拔職工施以講習訓練，不過人事制度中之一端，如不謀全面整頓，殊未易獲見整個效果。而以華籍職工錄用太濫，分子複雜等路政不良之原因，先存為木身職責求諒解之心理，我們認為是整頓路政翁途所不必要者。</p>
<p>友邦日本國內對於交通管理，向以秩序良好著稱。而往昔兩路管理，亦以秩序良好見稱，是則今日上站下站時之紛擾攘亂旅客痛苦之情形，即此一端，固為誰之責？我們願華中鐵道當局與在事職工共同三思，而有以迅謀整頓之！</p>

<h3>印代表集會昭南　臨時政府昨成立　各部長官同日宣誓就職</h3>
<p>昭南二十一日中央社電印度獨立聯盟全東亞代表者會護，二士一日上午士時半，在昭南大陳亞戲院舉行·到會東亞各地印人代表，及印度國民軍婦人部隊幹部等多名。開會如儀後·由總裁江特拉鮑斯登壇發表樹立臨時政府之重大意義·迄十三時休息。士六時繼擅舉行會議，席上議決對脫離英美支配，獲得獨立之緬甸及菲律賓拍發祝電，並感謝日木及支援獨立運動之東亞各友邦。同時江特拉飽斯　印度獲事獨立之實行計劃宣稱：印人當此祖國即將解放之際、實　自行樹立臨時政府，　其政府之指導下與國民軍協助，開始對英之最後鬭爭。各地代表對印人自行樹立臨時政府發激　達極點，均狂喊萬歲。推出江特拉鮑斯　臨時政府主席·繼鮑斯主席，在掌　雷動中登台　述任之聲明，旋任命軍事，外交，財政，宣傅、婦女等各部部長，並由鮑斯織裁朗讀宣言　，於茲基於東亞二百　印人總意之自由印度臨時政府遂告　生，巳完成解放三億八千　印度民衆之前　體制，大會至傍晚始閉幕。當夜鮑斯主席向祖國印度及全世界廣”講演·力言成立自由印度臨時政的之　義，並表明決戰至驅逐英勢力於印度境外　從巳。</p>
<p>昭南二十一日中央社電印度　　　時政府主席汀特拉鮑仍是日任命監時政府各部　後，各部長官叩舉行宣誓就職典愷，臨時政府於此巳告確立。茲將臨時政府名單列左主席　特拉鮑斯兼任軍事部　與外交部長，財政部長卡塔基·宣傅部長愛雅·婦入部長拉克西美夫人。</p>
<p>昭南二十一日中央社電印度自由臨時政府成立後·獨立聯盟並不因此而解消，玆決定鮑斯任臨時政府主席兼聯盟總裁，印度國民草前　屬於印度獨立聯盟，現政隸屬於聯盟政府，並由鮑斯兼任最高統帥。</p>
<p>印度臨時政府宣言</p>
<p>昭南二十一日中央社電　印度自由臨時政府日言則左：印度入民自一七五七年在孟加拉再敗於英軍　來議續奪鬭巳百年於滋，其間之歷史實為無數犧牲而造成者，然而吾人之祖先因當時缺乏組織·未能結成全國之共同戰綫，以抗抵敵人，實為千戰恨事。自一八八五年起，至第一次世界大戰未期止，印入為恢復失去之自由·會用盡一切手段·如擴大宣傳扒制英貨，暴動罷工，甚至武裝革命等，但迄未成功。迨至一九二〇年，甘地翁提倡不合作運動，二十年來、印人無不竭力從事愛國活動，印人非特巳恢復其政治意識，並將再度　成惟一之政治體制，一九三七年至一九三九年之間·國民會議內閣在印度入省所護之成績·巳充分證明印人巳有自冶之準場及其能力。此次解放印度鬬爭業巳準備就緒，日木與其盟邦，巳在東亞擊潰音人宿敵，此實為印人實現解放國家之惟一良機，時至今日，旅居海外之印橋業已崛起，團結一致，此在近世史上，實屬傾舉，尤以東亞二百餘萬之印　，巳在全體崛起之旗幟下，英勇奮國，英國之僞善主義巳使印度民衆呻吟於絕望之深淵，且其會得無壓之掠奪，巳逐使印度人民徬徨於飢餓綫上·英國統治印度，早已喪失人民信賴之基礎，而瀕於瓦解之旁途，當前之事態，即當覆　英國之　政，為印度國民天職，印度國民軍實力極為雄厚，且得有盟邦之援助，故深信必能完成此天職，印度人民於祖國解放之日將臨之際，樹立臨時政府及在臨時政府之指導下開始作最後鬭爭，然固有力之指導者悉在獄中，且國內同　之武力全被剝奪，故勢雞在印度國內樹立臨時政府，以指導鬥爭，因此此種任務，乃置於東亞印度獨立聯盟之肩上，故　人決意尊奉東亞印度聯盟之命，設置印度獨立　時政府，並以最大之責任，將敵國之勢力完全驅逐出印度，然後再根據民衆之意志，樹立永久之國民政府，故印度入民均應全體効忠臨時政府、政府決對全體人民保證信教之自由平等之權利，以及平　之機會。又政府決平等訓導人民，克服過去國內一切對立障碍·謀全國人民之福社與繁榮，茲特宣曹如右。</p>
<p>建設大東亞圈總力愈形堅强</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　印度臨時政府巳在路兩宣告成立，東亞民族擊滅英美建設東亞之總力，自必益形增强，尤其當日軍先發制人在緬甸展開攻勢·粉碎敵軍反攻東亞之企圖之時。印度臨時政府之成立，在積極的欽治攻勢上，其意義尤為重火。印度獨立運動於此時機將有極大進展，乃為勢所必然者，且印度獨立之完成·於此亦益增無限之希望·况此次日軍在緬句國開攻勢，即不僅為堅破敵人奪取緬甸之企團，同時亦可進　印度，　以敵人現正利用印度企圖作反攻緬甸進攻東亞之策源地，故日軍在緬之積極的軍事行動與印度臨時政府成立之政治的行動，司視為有互相呼　之意義。就整　大東亞建設而言，亦足以顯示戰略政　之一致。就印度國內而言，英美駐軍之橫暴龡　印度人民生活陷於絕墳，並加　印人反抗英美之意志，而此次印度臨時政府成立勢將更加促進印度國內之　英美抗爭運動·印度獨立運動在此印度內外一致熱烈門爭之日，豈僅足使敵人苦心焦慮無法措手而巳。再觀英美內部為互爭在印度之勢力，明爭暗鬥至為激烈、其矛盾之　深，正所以顯示英國已無力統　印度，英帝國之崩潰旣因英美為印度之鬥爭而加深，則今日印度內外獨立運動澎湃·尤足爲英帝國崩潰之先聲。印度臨時政府成立，誠可謂適得時宜。前者緬甸羣島於日本援助下，巳先後完成其自主獨立，今印度獨立運動又於日軍在緬甸展開攻勢之時成立臨時政府，作為完成獨立之基石·確倍敵軍反攻東亞之企圖，即將在此日軍　開攻勢及印度臨時政府成立之時而被完全粉粹，中國於獲得自主獨立以後，對於　西共他國家民族之爭取獨立自由，不僅深爲同意·自當進而協力其完成，　惟亞洲十　民衆共同協力擊滅英美爭取大東亞戰爭之勝利，始足以軍定東亞解放之某礎，而開始復興中國之大路。</p>
<p>爭取祖國獨立政治軍事並進</p>
<p>昭南二十一日中央社電　印度獨立聯盟總裁江特拉鮑斯，今於印度獨立聯盟　亞代表大會席上之演說要旨如次：此次會議之目的·乃在檢討本年七月以後之獨立運動活動及其進展情形·並進而謀求早日達成獨立目的之方策，余就任總裁，根據東亞印度人之人物總動員計劃後，首先改組聯盟本部，繼此更改編强化印度風民軍，結果使印度國民軍置於余之指揮下，邇來其面目已一新，將來仍將加以改　與強化，現已經以戰鬭技術與精神訓練，同時亦正積極從事　　，今志願者之　目已日見增多，倚預計將來於緬甸泰國二國內設立訓練　，基於總動員計劃，　於募集擺立運動運動資金及購辦國民軍軍需等事，各地均在實行，目巳事獲實效。數月以來，印度內地情勢已日漸緊張、民衆痛苦。益增加·因此吾　之運動乃亦益行加緊與庫　利政治施　雖曾得到若干之妥協，但其　壓欽策今後尙無所變，固孟加拉省飢饉為患，印度政治之不安巳愈激烈，此飢　原因，即英國於過去四年來為維持戰爭而榨取糧倉物資之桔　。八月緬甸之獨立·十月菲律賓之獨立，均可為印席人爭取自由而鬬爭必能達到目的之良證與鼓勵。全東亞之印度人今巳痛感必須將英國及其與國驅出印度，解放亞洲責任之加重，余訪問泰國緬甸之時，巳獲得該兩國政府給與吾人全而援助之諾約。余今願告諸君，關於未來鬥爭以及戰後建設計劃，余均巳有所準備，吾人已可想像將英國及其與國驅出印度後之情形，故貴人巳於印度獨立聯盟本部內設一「重建部」，以研究戰後重建之諸問題·故無論現在之獨立戰抑戰後所採之國策，今均已有萬全準備。現在吾人必須軍事政治同行併進，吾東亞之印度人尤其印實國民軍將兵，無不切望跨入祖國國土，開始最機獨立之戰爭早日到來，但此前尙有若干政治工作，有得台人完成，例如吾人必須組織印度獨立臨時政府，俾於其下開始鬥爭，事實上東亞之友入亦無不殷望香印度獨立臨時政府之誕生。印度獨立聯盟乃東亞各地印入之唯一代表機關，臨時欽府亦為一最適當之組織，然因諸印廳指導者多被拘於牢獄，故　政府於國內為事　所不需，故實際　負此大業之重任者，乃為吾祖國以外之東亞印人，又印度國外之鬥爭與國內之鬥爭，具有緊密關係者，乃不言可喩之事實，吾人之國外鬥爭，不但國內印度民衆即大部英印軍隊亦均有充分之支持，故我民國軍一旦越過印度國培，樹立印度自由國旗於印度國土時，印度國內必立即爆發一大草命，且此革命必　英國之統制權於死命。吾人於此所決定者，即最後鬥爭先準備行動，吾人之武力鬥爭終能越過印度國境向德里進擊，此進擊必待將盤踞於印度之英國最後一人驅出印度或投入牢獄之時方止·此進擊必待至印度國旗飛揚於總督府屋項上及於印度首度檢閱得勝之印度國民軍時方能結束。最後再　諸君，余於今日下午之大會上即發表印度臨時欽府之組織。</p>

<h3>反軸心軍增援　圖集中進攻　羅馬區登陸難獲逞</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　據海運社訉：議國南部東面戰况益趨劇烈·目前尙係先鋒之局部接觸，協約軍並未估有主動地位。德軍於本月十八日反攻，將英軍與加拿大軍逐出某小城後，復於前日在卡普拉東北擊潰美軍一隊·美軍於劇戰後退出某地·損失慘重·英美軍集中進攻之企圖頗受阻碍，且交通之破　與　候之惡劣·均不利於協約軍·然協約軍之等待階段，似巳近於結東，克拉克將軍殆巳集中美第五軍之大部分於伏爾托諾河及卡勒爾河之北岸，英　八軍之主力亦巳迫近前錢，蒙高茂　將軍之朱鋒顯已在溫契特羅至　波巴索之綫以西及比弗諾阿以西增加壓力。據稱協約軍於最近數日內，由海道增援頗多，其中兩師於非洲及西西里島戰役中為蒙特戈茂萊將軍之主力部隊·於西西軍具戰役中曾受重創，但已加以補充與改編，目前調至義國，顯示協約軍將集中進攻矣。</p>
<p>柏林廿一日中央社電　據德國新開社訊：義大利特別消息靈通方面謂：反軸心準備於最近之將來，在羅馬之附近自空中及海上登陸。英美航空運送之軍隊已有大量集中於其陣終之後，而觀於英美軍在那不勒斯港之熱烈行動，亦係預兆將有重大之行動發生。且此種推測，復以反軕心軍有西南義大利沿岸之船舶往來頻繁，亦足資佐證。柏林軍事方面亦　信此訉不疑，因　來源係自與義國　方均有聯絡，而其所供給之情報向以準確見稱，巴特里奧戰徒有不滿反軸心之態度，而欲示恩於德國方　以求立是於法內斯共和義大利政府者，均願供給重要之情報以為進身之階，又英美軍於義大利東西兩面之主要公路上之空軍加緊活勸，而共於戰綫上重組其軍隊，此亦可為反軸心大規模行動之另一佐證。此或係艾森電華將軍亦知進攻德軍之山嶺陣地，除遭重大之損失外，且或未能成功者，故將出於測國進攻之行動，以解救美第五車受英第八軍現所色之重　也。</p>
<h3>克里曼卓東南　蘇增重壓力　德軍增援正沉着應戰</h3>
<p>柏林廿一日中央社電　據海通社訊：難軍攻勢之重心，仍在克里曼卓東南。蘇軍企圖在該處掛大週末突破之缺口，自克里受卓至尼在貝特羅夫斯克以四志楔形攻勢，迄未减輕壓力。且由大砲及坦克東協助加緊進攻，德軍正增派預備隊赴前綫，此爲蘇軍悍然運用目前人力餘物力之優勢之另一原因。德軍沉着應戰，結果尙難逆料，然此戰結果，將影響聶伯河河套之載局及附近榮普　基至亞素夫海一帶之戰事·扼守諾剛草原之門戶之德軍，復遭猛烈之攻擊，該處戰事顯然與向克里曼卓方面突破之企圖有關。他　戰事不若南翼之重要，然蘇軍在某輔以北·契尼哥失西北，戈美爾，及尼維爾以南猛攻·均經劇戰後擊退·中部戈美爾與尼維爾之間僅有局部戰爭，蘇軍集中於列　格勒區域及拉多加湖以南，顯示蘇軍或將在該處發勸攻勞。</p>
<p>德方重視此一戰役</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電德國通訉社訉：蘇軍對克里受卓東南地區之戰鬥，正作最大努力，然突破口尙未能擴大。蘇軍深入德軍陣地之地域·以克單曼卓，尼　貝特羅夫斯克爲底邊成」三角形　點傾向四南，蘇軍似正威力自此頂點向南方及北方進出。德軍司令部，鋻於蘇軍於數量方面之優勢，乃一特逢第一綫陣地急向後方撤退，徐阻止蘇軍主力之攻勢，據前綫消息，近日天氣雖然惡劣，然仍繼續激戰，德蘇兩軍均作大規模之動員·尤其德空軍極為活躍。己使蘇軍砲兵陣地之努力戚低。克里受卓一役，結果如何，於各方而自有重大影響，現德軍司令部採退避戰略兼行反擊作戰，盡可能飾約兵力，以備冬季作戰。</p>
<p>戰事劇烈不減於前</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電德國新聞社訊：稱梅立托波爾區·尼普貝特羅夫斯克之西北·某輔之北·戈美爾之南·以及尼維爾河　　處等各焦點之大戰·星期二日仍在繼續進行中·劇烈之狀不減於前。蘇軍攻勢之重再心度在於尼普貝特羅夫斯克之西北，該區紅軍　繵增調生力軍，尤其對該區缺口之基地發動烈猛之進攻·蘇軍利用超等坦克車與最强大之大砲臼砲與排砲火，企圖擴大此等缺口·但德軍擲彈兵作擊强之抵抗，且不　敵方兇猛之砲火，以捷怏之自動武器擊倒在逖行中之蘇軍步兵蹤隊，前逖中之蘇軍坦克車先頭部隊車後緊隨摩托化步兵隊迎前作戰·德砲火目標準確之砲火，迫使蘇軍摩托化部隊不得不下車以自衛。在此一役中·德軍坦克車擊毀蘇方坦克車士七輛，使其不能行動。</p>
<p>蘇軍無法擴大裂口</p>
<p>紅軍向德軍山岳陣地衝擊·來勢甚兇，但德守軍力阻敵之猛攻，蘇軍以一切可調之軍隊，悉數加入作戰，如是者　二十次以上，蘇軍雖動用軍隊數團與坦克車數集團，以及大批射火器與步兵大砲，但任何一處均未能穿入德軍之陣綫。蘇軍在缺口之北翼，亦調用援軍至少五國團與大批坦克軍由北方進攻，力岡撕裂德軍之側面，以便擴大該缺口，當即發生激戰，雙方均有損失。事後敵軍被擊退至聶伯河上狹隘之橋面陣地，在若于處甚至被擊退至河巾島嶼上·亞索夫海之北·蘇軍再度試行穿入梅立托波爾城之陣綫，但給果仍被擊退至原陣地，市鎭之北有缺口一處，經德軍立即反攻後即吿消滅，結果紅軍對於該缺口無法加以任何利用。</p>

<h3>日本强化國內態勢</h3>
<p>國民徹底動員</p>
<p>此次的强化國內熊勢，在於航空戰力的擴充，食糧自給，並國肉防衛熊勞的徹底三點，國民動員除軍隊動員外，其重心指向於擴充航空戰力，國民動員方　中所　現的七項，均為當前提出於國民之前而亟應且體化的目標。總之·國民對此的協力，　視政府在其　逋實現途上怎樣結揚國民的士氣·使完成甚目的</p>
<p>過去的國民動員，對戰　的推移，和與此相應的生產關係·缺乏有機性。以大政翼贊會為主體的國民運動，對重要產業的勞働分配，因全　整備而來的勞務作出等，均和生產關係脫離，這是不容否定的</p>
<p>應付「舉一切集中於定陣戰爭這一點的緊兼時期」，在國民動員上，正不能不　這生產關係持有一體的有機性對戰局激烈化的自覺，每個國民都巳產生了。全國的靑年，不僅學生·在工廠，在農村，振奪其紳潔的情緒於愛關之念。昂揚此時此際　年的熱烈精緒之機運，就是國民動員之實質的强化。因此，政府須考慮使國民澈底認識時局之新協策·並企業的國家性之進一步的明　化·及　給制度之澈底蘭軍化，為國民動員的成敗之鍵。政府如欲在民間首先別新動員·而排除國民的一部中迄今猶存的非時局的私生活，則可說造成了使國民動員澈底化的基礎。</p>
<p>動員計劃進展</p>
<p>國民動員方策中所載的七項；第一，擴大關於軍事動國的數集範圍；第二，關於學生者，停止文法系學生的暫緩徵集，椎持義務敎靑年限的現狀；第三，關於男子勞務徵用的普遍化；第四，促進女子勞　；第五，因官廳外圍團體，統制機關人員的整理，停止服務年限的撤廢等所產生的剩餘動員力之活用；第六，為謀勞　者能寧的利用，而分配於適當的配置。這些都是存實施飛機增產上當然應取的措置。</p>
<p>沒有制空權，即沒有勝利，政府爲了飛機之量的生產，業已着手實行二十四小時制，而尤注重勞動力，資材的分配。把擴充戰力凝集於飛機上，國民動員的一切施策，也都適應此要求·禁止男子就　輕易戰種，及女子動員的强化·和停止文法系敎育同為政接間接以增產飛機，充足勞働力為目的而和先實現的措置。</p>
<p>日本的國民動員·隨着中國事變的進展，估計昭和十四年度的勞働需要起已開始計劃化自此以後，每年度作為國家計劃之一，在勞務動員計劃的名稱下辦定之·大東亞戰爭勃發後，脫却了單是部份的勞務動員的性格·自昭和十七年度起，改稱國民動員計劃·勞務動員唯國民皆勢勸後方才到逮完途的階段·在時和寸五年度計劃上，女子無業者為勞務動員的對象而為新的勞働力俱給之來源。十六年度·除一般勞務者外，計劃用所謂勤勞服役而充當一部分臨時的季節的勞鋤，動員計劃表示了從勞務者充足到國民皆勞働的狀態。大東亞戰爭在勞務行政上與以極大的影饗，戰爭勃發後即公佈實施國民勤勞報國協力令，打開了國民直接集團的服役於總勸員業務的道路，所以十七·十八兩年度的動員計劃，突入國民總動員工作的　準備勞之方向，視各自的能力，中國家實行轉變分配於其為認為必要的職業種類·質的動員·和徵用的最化，同在努力實現中。</p>
<p>刷新勞務內政</p>
<p>爲增强軍需生產的勞務動員，和生產關係之間，被要求其有機的一貫性。因此，政府內的具體施策，常須在關係老之間作更密切且迅速的處置，陸海軍省，　工省，厚生省等實行官廳的行政運營，今後勿使因權限的對立而失「時」。為貫澈「生產第一主義」這決戰行政的目的起見關於行欽運營的方法，從生　責任制的見地出發，更進一步的節單强力化。制止重要生產部門局長課長級專任官史的轉任，而今後更激底把握生產事情的措置，亦　予以考慮。</p>
<p>我們觀察到今日為止的勞務行政的經過時，如在水年春國民徽用令以次五勸令的改廢上所見，勞務行政對生產的現實，常追隨於後。從刷新勞務行政的意義上說來，和生產行政之問，應有聯繫强化的施策。</p>
<p>勞務動員為適應生產第一主義起見，民問的產　統制團體統制會，和產業報國運動的中心產業報國曾，在共勞務方面，應取更密切的指置，希望適應產業報國運動的新情勢而有飛躍的進展。</p>
<p>勞務的能率化</p>
<p>勞務者的供求，如徵　的强化上所見頗為迫切，而解決這間題的方策勞務的能率化，也就愈被注意。邪就　說，資材產通的不圓滑，勞務的偏在。為增强生產上的狹路而被提出討論，同時，實材，勞務間的不均衡，亦不能不予以考慮·為活用實材，提高效率，應採用企業集團制，勞務者的配置·亦希望以這產業集團為單位而實施。隨着企業整備而總·分，及合作工廠的系統整理就緒時·間不必說·即在目前，在同一地區內·同一企業內·熟練勞務者的通融·資材的通融，在增加生產上，應儘量利用。厚生省方面，衆已承認政府管理工廠·其他重要軍需工廠的大部分，即所謂總工廠者·為要在指定日期完成生產起見，得對分工廠合作工廠派遣總工竅的勞務者，</p>
<p>勞務的適當配置，乃勞務偏在的條正策，此次亦經提出，故其意義極為重大·企業整　之冠的紡續工廠，在迅速轉用的反面，設備與勞務者同納入於政府一元統制的範團，所以在勞務者之能　的使用上，造成了許多不充足的地方（翔：譯自九月二十六日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>評言</p>
<h3>放寬增產的狹路</h3>
<p>昨　戰時生產而　的重點，在於鼓動各各種有　戰時生產的新興事業，而不僅在於扶助旣成的幾種生產事業，其意義就是　打　增　的狹路，能予　寬的地方，　量把它放寛，　以流通經濟　市中　塞的游　，因此，一般人對於新興實業的上市股　審查問題，未安縬　，也就是這　意忠。</p>
<p>如今，移　之二次新敵產中，又多企業關係二十一件，其中有關各種生產事業者，亦復不少，當然可以認為增產狹路的又一度放寛。今後我們所當努力的，正是新敵　管理委員會發言人在日時舉行移官式中所說的機句話：「我方對於　管敵　，　向增加生產一條路上努力，例如對於已開工之工廠，務使其繼續發展，對於未開工之工廠，必設法開工，」無疑地，這是生產界人人所抱負的願望，不僅是自今日始了。</p>
<p>現在我們所更須補充的，就是在求人方面，必須接官以後的工廠原料，能夠獲得友邦當局的寛大協助，務期原料的配給，毋虞匱乏，原料的運輸，毋虞阻滯；在求已方面，必須接管以後的工廠管理，能夠實事求是，銳意必良，尤須注重於技術人才之培養，勞工福利這增進，生產效率之提高，俾資共同策力於戰時經濟之體制，那方才無負友邦移管的盛情。</p>

<h3>一區衛生處發表　第週衛生淺說　如何撲滅天花</h3>
<p>中央社訉　處此人口稠密之上海，如欲保持康健，誠非易事，第一必行象瞭衛生之道，遵循不懈，庶能保健而增加對於疾病之抵抗能力，在傳染病流行時，更須極端謹愼預防，如果不幸傳染，亟須立刻醫治，並行隔離，以防蔓延。公我衛生之促進傳染病之預防，固為衛生當局之本職，然欲達到盡善盡美之境，實有賴於每一市民熱誠合作，蓋非先促進個人衛生，不能為功。第一區公署衛生處，有鑑認斯，為增加一般市民之衛生常識起見，特編衛生淺說一輯，每週於本市各報間發表，以供參考</p>
<p>預防天花</p>
<p>天　俗稱出　子，是一種極可怕的傳染病，生了此種疾病，不但是病人生命危險，而且很容易把病傳給別人，蔓延起來非常迅速，天花的傳染，大多是和病人直接接觸而起，不過病人的衣服被褥，及一切病人用過的器皿，也都是問接傳染天花的媒介，普能通總以為天花只有嬰孩才會生的。年紀大了，不會再生的了，避是一個極大的錯誤，事實上，無論年紀活到了多大，一棧有生天花的可能，不過大人生了天花的可能，不過大人生了天花，其死亡率沒有　小孩來得高罷了。世界其他各國，由於政府及人民之努力，此病已絕跡，反　我國各地仍舊常有天花發生，不能說不是一件可恥的事件吧。其實天花的預防方法，比較任何別種　染病來得容易，而且右效騐，現在將關於預防天花的常職來講一講，同時把上海特別市第一區公署衛生處防止天花的步　，一一介紹於後：</p>
<p>種痘防天花</p>
<p>只有種牛痘可以防止天花，除了各痘以外，頂也沒有第二個預防的好方法了，吾　對於種痘一事，極為普遍，十餘年前已有種痘知識，但　因拘於迷信，每須選擇吉日或等至百花生日，（農層二月十二日）　肯去種痘，殊不知多少嬰孩，在未到百花生日以前，已感染天花而死，這是多麼悽慘而可痛。</p>
<p>每年到百花生日，有成千成萬嬰孩，到上海特別市第一區公署衛生處各分局去種痘，這是一個的印象，但是我們也痛心着許多因此遲延種痘而遭不幸的嬰兒們，做父母的，你們要暁得本衛生處，是全年常為公衆種痘的。</p>
<p>記牢吧，小孩生後一二星期內便可以種痘了，最遲也須在滿月以前要種牛痘；用不着再等待百花生日之業臨，隨時都可到最近衛生分處去種痘，不花　分文，只氏五分鐘的時間，就可以完全預防這可怕的天花了。</p>
<p>生了一天花怎樣辦</p>
<p>如不幸生了天花怎麼辦呢？一般人差不多仍依照着舊有風谷習慣，把　人關在房間裏，不許任何生客跑進去探望，並把窗戶都用紙緊緊地封閉着，怕病人見光吹着邪風，弄得這房間陰沉沉吸不着一點新鮮空氣，在醫學未發達以前，沒有衛生設備的那此荒僻鄕村裏，我們不能否認這房間自然地　成了一羊隔離病室，免了許多人受到傳染，似乎也有它的好處，但是我們試想想在人烟稠密的上海，　少人多，一間　子裏　滿了十幾家人，一旦其中有人生了天花，你還能把病人隔離　來　？本市衛生當局，早有為傳染病人　立一完着的隔離醫院了，如果家裏有了天花病人，不要再像從前那樣把病人隱藏起來，趕快把他送到隔離醫院去，病人到醫院之後，衛生處立刻會派人到病　住所去施行消毒，並且會替和病人接觸過的人，不論男女老幼，　種牛痘，只有這樣做法，才會救了病人，同時也會救了你們自己。</p>
<p>如保撲滅天花</p>
<p>以下幾條方法，都是輕而易舉的事，希望全市居民切實遵行，共同努力幫助衛生當局來撲滅這可怕的天花。</p>
<p>嬰孩出世後，不論冬夏，最遲在嬰孩滿月之前，必須種牛痘。</p>
<p>不問老幼，每隔三年需覆種牛痘一次，可隨進到最近衛生分處去種分文不取。</p>
<p>不要去探望生天花的病人，以防傳染。</p>
<p>天花病人必須立刻送到隔離醫院去治療，以免傳染他人，第一區公　衛生處之隔離醫院，是設在北海路一六三號。</p>
<p>病人到醫院後，他的衣服被褥和一切用過之　皿不要移動或隙藏，　衛生處派人來完全拿去　，待　毒完學後，送囘來再用，衛生處辦理此種手續，完全不取報酬。</p>
<p>家裏發現天花後，與病人　觸的人，或其親友，不論已否種過牛痘，都須讓衛生處派人來種痘不要　選，如　在十六天以內，發現有感受不舒服或可疑的症狀，必須立刻要報告衛生處，或亩　　師檢查，以斷定是否已經　染着天花。</p>

<h3>難童敎養收容所幼幼敎養院訪問　敎管合一制</h3>
<p>幼幼敎養院裏充滿着活氣　然而，同時也有非常嚴格的管理，他們實行「教管合一制」·敎師除聽任課務外·並須負訓　及管理的貴任。所以都是專任·終日駐院辦公，日常一切生活·均與院生其甘苦，並且「身體力行」，以為表卒，在敎導方面·尤稱嚴格·經常考查院生學業及操行狀况·其成續過於惡劣不棋遣就的·規定須令其退學出院，院裏現有住院職員五人，內院務主任一人·會計兼文醫一人，給養兼事務一人，淸潔兼外勤一人·護士一人。男女工友六人·在「教管合一制」下，白天的敎室，使上就改作讓室·由敎員同書·而在經濟的原則下·體常兼作食常與遊息室·進食時分二次·每次分若干組，每組八兒童，各有一組長。</p>
<p>幼幼院對於兒童　養·非常注意，一向　兒童保障　合作，定有　養爽·每日間　食物養料·均有標準，並有紀錄。現在母日作糧二百五十斤·　中米占三分之一·山芋四分之一，其餘如赤豆·麥粉，苞米粉等，每天規定一飯二粥，均用水汀煮　，所以燃料　省，菜蔬油　等·每日至少一百五十元，敎職員另加數十元·米向區公所申領，每月十三包，每包一石二斗半·山芋等就近購買，其他食品·都大量購入，價格較廉，煤球煤層，還能照作價對折付款。因此在過去，伙食費較一般為省，每名每月平均不出白元。不過，現在由於物價不斷的高漲，給養標準不得不漸漸减低。全靠他們特別重視營養方面，所以還不致十分影響到健康。</p>
<p>衣着被服方面，每一兒童大都有單衣二套，棉夾衣各一套·鞋子二雙，尙見敎潔·　子多未備。臥被多用棉毯和軍隊生活差不多·而月每兩個兒童有毯四五條·也已足用了，大約每童每月的衣被費為十元左右。</p>
<p>兒童健康問題，過去不很好，大都染有癩疥瘡，癩痢等等，因此設立醫務室及病房各一間，聘定駐院護士一人·主持全院　藥衛生事宜，由年長兒產學作助手·每日分組檢查·每名還有檢查卡片·不么疥瘡即告絕跡，即如癩痢及紅眼也都消減了，平時實行洗潔·强迫入浴，故傳康狀態漸伴·又有前工部局衛生處各大醫院及西醫江知勉·葛馥庭·郭樹　，陳占元·郭星蓀·周壽祥，　鳳蓀，茅壽章，龔養賢及中醫趙官夫等醫師·經常赴院義務診視·遇有重病·即送陷離醫院·紅十字會醫院，上海平民肺病醫院，益友醫院，而中國這德總會，濟民醫院等更在近咫尺，所以兒童們的健康已有充分的保障了。</p>

<h3>改進義務敎育的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 法</p>
<p>這幾年來，由於生活指數不斷上昇的結果，除了絕少數的幸運兒之外，大多數學齡兒童印靑年，是被摒棄在學交門外了，—失學，這從國家，社會或自身任何一個角度說，無疑是敎育文化上的重大損害。於是，適應於這種悄勢，年來助學金運動和義敎工作，風起雲湧似的盛極一時。雖然，這是近乎消極性的敎育救　事業，然而，又有誰能忽視這一環呢！</p>
<p>在上海今天幹義敎工作的，大多是職業靑年或學生靑年·他們從事於敎育工作，與其說是志願，還不如說是熱忱和興趣來得恰當。這是一個慣　的事例·提幾個志趣相同的年靑人，結合在一起，募得了一筆經費，於是，租賃校舍，張貼招生廣告，　立教學用品，測騐新生·糧級……一所義校就道機產生了，由於這一批教普圈外職業靑年的熱忱，　校社量的方面說，已　是可相當樂觀了；但他們終　是　外人士，而且敎育工作也不是一時熱忱所能濟事的。因此，我們如果揭破量的表皮而作深一層官的深究時，就認為有探討一下的必要，「廉價的樂觀」是敗事有餘而成事小足的。</p>
<p>教育是什麼？這到現在還是一個聚訟紛紜的問題，這裏不想討論這個大題目，但假使說教育不僅僅是識幾個字，這是誰都不能否認的。因此，要達到這個敎育目標，怕不是祗懂得　修敎育原理而又　在熱忱的業餘敎育工作者所能做到的吧！就筆者所見到的一個義校·是由二十幾個職業靑年開辦的，因此，就由二十幾位老師。在這　僧多粥少的局面下，學校的日課表上，同一年級的國語科，由後個人來擔任，昨天張三，今天李四，明天……姑不從敎育原理上來說明；這樣非馬看花式的敎學，就述僅僅是識個字的所謂極狹義的文字敎育，由得大大的打個折扣；文字敎育以外的師生情感。學生個性，……自然是更談不上了。他們敎學的動機和熱忱，筆者是極表欽佩的。但是，在從教育者立塲的衡量下，這不能不說是敎育的失敗。</p>
<p>其次，是敎材問題了，這又處理得錯誤百出。新敎育學「兒童中心說」，兒童是教學的中心，教師的地位僅僅是一個指導者，敎材是更不用說了·這在設備節單，師資不健的義校裏，該是超限度的慾望，然而敎材得根據和適合受教者的需要和程度，道句話想來是小會錯的吧！可是，這在仙們又操之過急；據筆者知道，有一個義校六年級敎授繁分明—這在學生日常生活需要上是亳無用處的—，另一個義校呢！五年級入學測騐題。一開始就是一試述電之成因。「略述我國的大都市」「……」這把孩子們簡直是帶到五里霧中去。這種不管兒童興趣如何，却盡量把自已認為有價值的知識灌輸給兒童的「塡鴨式敎育，」是不是今天所應有的？要不要筆者替孩子們來一次呼籲：「敎救孩子！」</p>
<p>話得說囘來，那些教師們主觀上是善良的而可原宥的，但因措施的不適當，客觀上却近乎播殘兒童了，這一點不用我們忽視而值得一再提出的，筆者草這一篇文字，也是以這一個立塲做出發點，希望今天從事義敎工作的敎師們！把它當作一面鏡子，「有則改之，無則加勉，」這是筆者所馨香祝福的了。</p>
<h3>抑平雜糧價格</h3>
<p>— 呆影</p>
<p>自米糧統制委員會成立以來，關於此買配給等計劃，已先後決定。加果所有計劃，能逐一使其實現，則在未來一年之中，食米價格似可穩定，而民生自可少見安定。不過事實上今日的民生開題，不僅在米糧方而，其他物品的奇昂，其影響於民生　苦，此之米糧恐有過之無不及。這裏面，尤以日用品和雜糧為甚，而目前日用品的限價，配給·當局也正規劃，雖實行之期非遠。但雜糧方面，還沒有嚴密統制·筆者以為此一問題，亦極端電要，繼米糧以後，當迅速加以統制，而嚴密的規定限價，否則民生還是不能安定，充乎其量福是解決了食米問題罷了。</p>
<p>在雜糧之中，特別　着是大豆，蠶豆，赤豆，綠豆之類，目前豆類的售價·莫不超過所規定的米糧限價。這樣食米的價格雖有規定·而低跌了些，但各種雜糧·還是一仟投機者的囤積和高抬售價·這是件極不公允的事。因為以豆價說來，較前都以米價為低，而目前大豆的價格·竟肉倍於食米。世外蠶豆千元一擔，赤豆綠豆，都在千元以外，這是反常的狀態。似有調整的必要。否則產米區域的居民影響非小，而種雜糧的區域，似乎太便宜了些。</p>
<p>雜糧的售價奇昂，影響於民生·事實上甚於食米·譬如大豆的奇昂·使豆油，豆餅，豆腐，醬油，以及各種大豆製物品·都非高價出售不可·使問在今日的情形之下·普通人家·魚肉無力購買·吃些豆腐·也覺得有些買不起·何說素菜缺不了豆油·他如蠶豆也是貧民階級的大衆食物·而如花生的新價。超過三千元一擔·更是貴得使人無力購艮。在這裏·不是可看出雜糧量過食米·影響之甚·爲鐵般的事實。</p>
<p>推而至於麩皮豆餅的過分高貴·影響於猪價，肉價的不住向上、和民生間題都有密切的關係。所以雜糧的加緊統制，抑平價格，亦為當前急務。否則米價低了·雜糧格價有漲無跌，豈能使民生間題得以解決·所以今後一切物品的價格，當以米價為準則依據，·在戰前低於米價者，不能使其超越米價，依舊要維持戰前的此價。否則民生問題，無法解決·米價雖低了些，國民的痛苦壓迫，並未少減。所以我們正切盼雜糧售價，亦能迅速壓平，進而推廣到蛋類，蔬菜，都能跟米價而向下，才能眞正解除一部分民生的疾苦呢·願當局迅速顧到這點才好。</p>

        <h1>1943.10.22</h1>
<h3>Contributions to the Rice Control Committee Authorities</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Committee has recently been actively advancing its work. On the 19th, it convened a preparatory meeting in Shanghai for trade associations involved in rice procurement from various regions. This was followed by a consultative meeting to exchange procurement ideas. On the 21st, a joint meeting of directors and deputy directors from various regions was also held.</p>
<p>We have always felt that managing grain administration requires not only keenness and meticulousness, but also agility and clarity. Confusion, negligence, slowness, and entanglement are all unacceptable. The Rice Control Committee has been in preparation for over a month, but actual work remains to be launched. Regarding agility in time, we hope that the committee authorities and representatives from various regions will strive to achieve this. Especially after these several meetings, entering the practical work stage is critical.</p>
<p>The work of the Rice Control Committee can be roughly divided into three sections: procurement, transportation, and distribution. Of course, all three are extremely important and cannot be neglected. However, transportation and distribution are in a subordinate position because transportation and distribution can only happen after procurement. Even if the capabilities and methods of transportation and distribution are superb, they still depend on successful procurement to be effective. Therefore, the procurement work can be said to be in a major position. The representatives of the trade associations involved in rice procurement from various regions all bear the important mission of procurement. Being able to gather together in advance to exchange ideas and experiences should lead to ideal progress in the technology and methods of rice procurement work in the future. Therefore, we have particularly high expectations for the joint meeting of directors and deputy directors from various regions, hoping that everyone will earnestly abide by the agreed methods and work hard for procurement. Originally, meetings in officialdom often involve superficiality, leading to ridicule such as "meeting without discussion, discussing without deciding, deciding without acting, and acting without effort." Now, the Rice Control Committee is a commercial autonomous organization, and the representatives of the trade associations involved in procurement from various regions are also giants in the business world. We hope to correct the accumulated bad habits of officialdom meetings and promote the spirit of business autonomy, paying special attention to "deciding and acting, and acting with effort." Rice procurement work may have its own special circumstances in each location. Whether it is the regulation of commodity prices, the distinction of grain quality, or the proper storage, local merchants can handle these reasonably and appropriately based on their experience. Here, we contribute our humble opinions on principles, hoping that representatives from various regions will fully understand the importance of people's food, the purpose of the government's organization of the Rice Control Committee, and the difficulty of their own responsibilities, and handle everything with precision and agility, helping the Rice Control Committee succeed, which is helping the country's grain administration succeed.</p>
<p>In addition, the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Food has now been abolished. We still have two points of opinion to offer to the Rice Control Committee authorities for attention:</p>
<p>First, the grain storage warehouses built by the Ministry of Food in the past are now the storage places for the Rice Control Committee to procure rice in various regions. Utilize them as much as possible. The original rice in the warehouses should be transferred together and preserved as a whole. In principle, storage methods must prevent mildew and maintain good quality.</p>
<p>Second, among the employees of the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Food in the past, there were many technical experts. The Rice Control Committee should select and employ them so that no talent is wasted.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food was originally a government agency specializing in grain administration. The Rice Control Committee is a commercial autonomous organization designated by the government, a semi-official, government-supervised, merchant-operated institution. Although there are shifts in work between them, the common goal is still to regulate people's food. From the perspective of the Ministry of Food and the Rice Control Committee, they may each have their own responsibilities, but in our view, it is the same step. We read in the newspaper on the 20th that the Rice Procurement and Sales Administration was ending its business. The person in charge of the Ministry of Food made a statement, "In order to take the overall situation into account, the Ministry of Food should have been responsible for distribution by the Rice Control Committee since October. However, because the committee repeatedly requested to continue to maintain the status quo, and with the concern of all parties, we temporarily maintained the status quo. However, we hope that the Rice Control Committee will start purchasing as soon as possible and continue to handle distribution matters, so that people's food and military rations will not be interrupted." The Ministry of Food still has such expectations for the Rice Control Committee. Therefore, we are even more eagerly hoping that the Rice Control Committee will quickly assume its mission. Taking advantage of this time when representatives from various regions are gathered in Shanghai, we dare to offer this to you all, and strive to complete the important task of regulating people's food!</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Central China Railway Transportation</h3>
<p>Today's newspaper reported that the Central China Railway authorities are actively reorganizing railway administration. They are establishing railway colleges to train employees. They are sending personnel to North China, Manchuria, and other places to investigate the status of railway education and administration for reference. We express our admiration for the Central China Railway authorities' emphasis on transportation and reorganization of railway administration. However, establishing colleges and training employees is only one aspect of reorganizing railway administration, and it is slow in terms of time. It fails to immediately correct the shortcomings of current railway transportation because training employees requires a considerable amount of time, and it is impossible for everyone to receive training. We are not saying that training employees is not necessary at present, but that the current reorganization of railway administration, which requires satisfactory results, should be thoroughly adjusted from many aspects. Consider the urgency and determine the priorities, establish a plan, and strictly implement it. Only then can the effect of reorganization be spoken of.</p>
<p>Before the 26th year, the passenger traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways was the highest among all railways in the country. The number of employees and the proportion of route length were also the highest among all railways in the country. The two railways had more than 10,000 employees in total. Of course, it was inevitable that there were both good and bad employees. However, because the authorities strictly stipulated personnel systems, personnel regulations, rewards and punishments, all were based on laws and regulations, without favoritism, and strictly enforced. This created a good environment of law and discipline. Even if there were bad elements, they had no way to use their tricks. In addition, continuous spiritual training gradually transformed the lazy into good, achieving the effect of changing customs. At that time, the transportation on the two railways was orderly and convenient for travelers. The credit was of course due to the efforts and service of all employees, but the leadership of the authorities above and the spirit of actively seeking reorganization were particularly commendable.</p>
<p>Today's Central China Railway Company manages routes that are more than just the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. The number of employees, just Chinese, has reached 30,000, accounting for three-fifths of the total. Indeed, due to excessive employment and complex elements, management is quite difficult. However, we believe that the focus of reorganization is not on the objective difficulty of starting and achieving results due to the large number of people and the complexity of elements. It lies in whether the authorities have the determination, sincerity, and perseverance. If there is determination, sincerity, and perseverance, then starting with a strict personnel system, stipulating reward and punishment regulations, and strictly enforcing them, especially for middle and senior-level cadres and employees, preventing bad elements from hiding, leading by example, and acting decisively, we believe that it will not be difficult to eliminate corruption and create a clean atmosphere and provide convenience for passengers in a short period of time. The current selection of employees for lectures and training is only one aspect of the personnel system. If a comprehensive reorganization is not planned, it will not be easy to see the overall effect. To first have the mentality of seeking understanding for one's own responsibilities, attributing the poor conditions of railway administration to reasons such as excessive employment of Chinese employees and complex elements, we believe is unnecessary in the path of reorganizing railway administration.</p>
<p>Friendly country Japan has always been known for good order in traffic management. In the past, the two railways were also known for good order. Therefore, the current chaos and commotion when getting on and off the trains, and the suffering of passengers, this alone, whose responsibility is it? We hope that the Central China Railway authorities and the employees involved will jointly reflect on this and quickly seek reorganization!</p>

<h3>Indian Representatives Gather in Syonan, Provisional Government Established Yesterday, Ministers Take Office on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) The All-East Asia Representatives Conference of the Indian Independence League was held at the Cathay Theatre in Syonan on the 21st at 10:30 AM. Representatives of Indians from various parts of East Asia, as well as cadres of the Women's Unit of the Indian National Army, and many others attended. After the meeting began, President Chandra Bose took the stage and spoke about the great significance of establishing a provisional government, and the meeting recessed at 13:00. At 16:00, the meeting resumed, and the attendees decided to send congratulatory telegrams to Burma and the Philippines, which had broken away from the control of the United States and Britain and gained independence, and expressed gratitude to Japan and other friendly nations in East Asia that supported the independence movement. At the same time, Chandra Bose proclaimed the implementation plan for India's independence: the people of India must establish a provisional government for themselves at this time when their homeland is about to be liberated, and with the assistance of the National Army under the guidance of the government, begin the final struggle against Britain. Representatives from various regions expressed extreme excitement about the people of India establishing a provisional government for themselves, and shouted "Long live!" He nominated Chandra Bose as the chairman of the provisional government. After Chairman Bose took the stage amidst thunderous applause and described his statement of taking office, he then appointed ministers of military affairs, foreign affairs, finance, propaganda, and women, and Chairman Bose read a declaration. The Provisional Government of Free India, based on the general will of 2 million Indians in East Asia, was born, and has completed the preliminary system to liberate 380 million Indian people. The conference closed in the evening. That night, Chairman Bose gave a speech to his homeland India and the world, strongly advocating the significance of establishing the Provisional Government of Free India, and stating his determination to fight until the British forces are driven out of India.</p>
<p>Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) After Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Provisional Government, appointed the ministers of the provisional government that day, the ministers held a swearing-in ceremony, and the provisional government was established at this point. The list of the provisional government is as follows: Chairman Chandra Bose concurrently serves as Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finance Minister Kataki, Propaganda Minister Aiyah, and Women's Minister Mrs. Lakshmi.</p>
<p>Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) After the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the Independence League will not be dissolved because of this. It is decided that Bose will serve as the chairman of the Provisional Government and the president of the League. The Indian National Army previously belonged to the Indian Independence League, and is now subordinate to the League government, and Bose also serves as the supreme commander.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Indian Provisional Government</p>
<p>Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) The declaration of the Indian Provisional Government is as follows: Since the Indian people were defeated by the British army in Bengal in 1757, the struggle for independence has continued for a hundred years, and its history has been created by countless sacrifices. However, our ancestors, due to a lack of organization at that time, failed to form a common national front to resist the enemy, which is a matter of regret. From 1885 to the end of the First World War, the Indian people used all means to restore their lost freedom, such as expanding propaganda, boycotting British goods, riots, strikes, and even armed revolution, but they have not succeeded. Until 1920, Gandhi promoted the non-cooperation movement. For 20 years, the Indian people have devoted themselves to patriotic activities. The Indian people have not only restored their political consciousness, but will also once again form a unified political system. The achievements of the National Congress Cabinet in the provinces inhabited by the Indian people between 1937 and 1939 have fully proved that the Indian people have the preparations and capabilities for self-government. The struggle for the liberation of India is now ready. Japan and its allies have defeated the long-time enemy of the British people in East Asia. This is the only good opportunity for the Indian people to realize the liberation of their country. Today, overseas Indians have risen up and united, which is a rare event in modern history. Especially the more than 2 million Indians in East Asia are fighting bravely under the banner of a total uprising. The hypocrisy of the British people has made the Indian people groan in the abyss of despair, and their unbridled plundering has made the Indian people wander on the line of starvation. The British rule in India has long lost the foundation of people's trust and is on the verge of collapse. The current situation is to overthrow British tyranny, which is the duty of the Indian people. The Indian National Army is extremely powerful and has the assistance of allies, so it is believed that it will be able to complete this duty. The Indian people are establishing a provisional government on the eve of the liberation of their motherland and starting the final struggle under the guidance of the provisional government. However, those with strong leadership are all in prison, and the armed forces of the compatriots in the country have all been deprived, so it is difficult to establish a provisional government in India to guide the struggle. Therefore, this task is placed on the shoulders of the Indian Independence League in East Asia. Therefore, people are determined to obey the orders of the East Asia Indian League and set up the Indian Provisional Government of Independence, and with the greatest responsibility, completely expel the forces of the enemy country from India, and then establish a permanent national government based on the will of the people. Therefore, all Indian people should be completely loyal to the provisional government. The government is determined to guarantee the freedom of religion, equality, and equal opportunities for all people. The government is also determined to equally train the people to overcome all obstacles to internal opposition in the past and to seek the well-being and prosperity of the people of the country. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>The General Strength of Building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is Becoming Stronger</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Provisional Government of India has been announced and established in Burma. The general strength of the East Asian nations to defeat the United States and Britain and build East Asia will inevitably be further enhanced. Especially when the Japanese army preemptively launched an offensive in Burma to crush the enemy's attempt to counterattack East Asia, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India is of particularly great significance in the active political offensive. The Indian independence movement will have great progress at this time, which is inevitable. Moreover, the completion of India's independence has increased infinite hope for this. Furthermore, the Japanese army's offensive in Burma is not only to firmly crush the enemy's attempt to seize Burma, but also to advance into India, because the enemy is now using India in an attempt to counterattack Burma and attack East Asia. Therefore, the active military actions of the Japanese army in Burma and the political actions of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India can be regarded as having the meaning of mutual cooperation. In terms of the construction of the entire Greater East Asia, it is also sufficient to show the unity of strategic politics. As far as India is concerned, the tyranny of the British and American troops has caused the lives of the Indian people to fall into a desperate state, and has intensified the Indian people's will to resist the United States and Britain. The establishment of the Provisional Government of India will further promote the anti-British and anti-American movement in India. On the day when the Indian independence movement is fiercely fought both inside and outside India, it will not only cause the enemy to be distressed and unable to do anything. Looking at the internal struggles between Britain and the United States to compete for power in India, the open strife and secret struggle are extremely fierce, and the depth of their contradictions shows that Britain is no longer able to control India. The collapse of the British Empire has been deepened by the struggle between Britain and the United States for India, and today's vigorous independence movement inside and outside India is a prelude to the collapse of the British Empire. The establishment of the Provisional Government of India can be said to be timely. Previously, Burma and the islands had completed their autonomy and independence under the assistance of Japan. Now, the Indian independence movement has established a provisional government as the cornerstone for completing independence at the time when the Japanese army launched an offensive in Burma. It is indeed doubly crushing the enemy's attempt to counterattack East Asia, which will be completely crushed by the offensive launched by the Japanese army and the establishment of the Provisional Government of India. After China has gained autonomy and independence, it not only deeply agrees with the struggle for independence and freedom of the ethnic groups in West Asia and other countries, but will also advance and cooperate with its completion. Only when the people of Asia and other ethnic groups work together to defeat the United States and Britain and win the victory in the Greater East Asia War can we lay a solid foundation for the liberation of East Asia and begin the great road to the revival of China.</p>
<p>Strive for National Independence, Political and Military Advancement Simultaneously</p>
<p>Syonan, 21st (Central News Agency) Chandra Bose, President of the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech at the All-Asia Representatives Conference of the Indian Independence League, the main points of which are as follows: The purpose of this conference is to review the activities and progress of the independence movement since July of this year, and to seek ways to achieve the goal of independence as soon as possible. After I took office as president, based on the plan of total mobilization of Indians in East Asia, I first reorganized the League headquarters, and then changed the composition and strengthened the Indian National Army, resulting in the Indian National Army being placed under my command. Its appearance has been renewed, and it will continue to be changed and strengthened in the future. Combat technology and spiritual training are now being carried out at the same time, and the recruitment is also actively proceeding. The number of volunteers has been increasing day by day. It is expected that training camps will be set up in Burma and Thailand in the future. Based on the total mobilization plan, various places are implementing the collection of funds for the liberation movement and the purchase of military supplies for the National Army, and practical results have been achieved. In recent months, the situation in India has become increasingly tense, and the suffering of the people has increased. Therefore, our movement has also been intensified and expanded. Although some compromises have been obtained in political measures, its repressive policy has not changed in the future. The famine in Bengal and the political unrest in India have become more and more intense. The cause of this famine is the squeeze of food and materials by Britain for the past four years to maintain the war. The independence of Burma in August and the independence of the Philippines in October can all be good evidence and encouragement for the Indian people to strive for freedom and achieve their goals. The Indians in East Asia now deeply feel that they must drive the British and their allies out of India and increase the responsibility for the liberation of Asia. When I visited Thailand and Burma, I obtained the promise of full assistance from the governments of the two countries. I would like to tell you that I have made preparations for future struggles and post-war construction plans. We can already imagine the situation after driving the British and their allies out of India. Therefore, you have set up a "Reconstruction Department" in the Indian Independence League headquarters to study the problems of post-war reconstruction. Therefore, whether it is the current war of independence or the national policies adopted after the war, we are now fully prepared. Now we must advance military and political affairs at the same time. We Indians in East Asia, especially the soldiers of the Indian National Army, are all eager to step into the territory of our motherland and start the war of independence as soon as possible. However, before that, there are still some political tasks that must be completed by the Taiwanese people. For example, we must organize an Indian Provisional Government of Independence to begin the struggle under it. In fact, the friends in East Asia are also eager for the birth of the Indian Provisional Government of Independence. The Indian Independence League is the only representative organization of Indians in East Asia, and the Provisional Government is also the most appropriate organization. However, because most of the leaders of the Indian government are detained in prisons, the government cannot do anything in the country. Therefore, the people who actually bear the heavy responsibility of this great cause are the Indians in East Asia outside our homeland. Moreover, the struggle outside India and the struggle inside India have a close relationship, which is a self-evident fact. Our struggle outside India is fully supported not only by the Indian people in the country, but also by most of the British Indian troops. Therefore, once our National Army crosses the Indian border and raises the Indian flag of freedom in Indian territory, a major revolution will immediately break out in India, and this revolution will certainly put the British control to death. What we have decided here is to prepare for the final struggle. Our military struggle will eventually cross the Indian border and advance towards Delhi. This advance will not stop until the last Briton entrenched in India is driven out of India or thrown into prison. This advance will not end until the Indian flag is flown over the roof of the Governor's Palace and the victorious Indian National Army is reviewed in the capital of India. Finally, I would like to tell you that I will announce the organization of the Indian Provisional Government at the conference this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Ownerless Chinese Houses Between Han and Japanese Sides</h3>
<p>Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) The friendly country Japan, in order to respect our country's sovereignty, had first returned the properties owned by our people and transferred the management of the enemy properties of the United States and Britain to our country. On the 19th, a resident of the friendly country transferred the ownerless Chinese horses and other items managed by the Naval Attache's Office in the former Japanese Concession to the municipal government for management. The transfer ceremony was held at the Resident Group at 10:00 AM. Those present were Masuda, captain of the resident police chief of the friendly country's Naval Attache's Office. Yao, the secretary-general, represented the mayor of the city government in receiving the property. It is reported that after the municipal government receives the houses, the Real Estate Committee will manage them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Yunnan Advance in Two Routes, Northern Route Has Reached South of Lushui</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to reports, after the Japanese troops advanced to the Nujiang River in western Yunnan Province, they divided their troops into two routes on the opposite bank of the river to attack the north and south sides. The northern route launched a large-scale encirclement operation against the Yu army in the Gaoligong Mountains. The southern route is still continuing to shell the Yu army on the east bank from the west bank of the Nujiang River.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) According to the announcement of the Yu Military Commission in Chongqing on the 20th, the battle situation in Yunnan is as follows: The border war in Yunnan is still extremely fierce. The Japanese troops who advanced to the vicinity of the opposite bank of Liuku have received new reinforcements and advanced in two routes on the 16th. The northern route has reached the south of Lushui and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. The southern route advanced to the opposite bank of Lichai Dam at noon on the 18th and shelled the Yu army's positions on the east bank. Fierce fighting is also taking place in Qigongfang, north of Jietou, and near Yingpan Street, northeast of Yingpan Street.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Yunnan Japanese Army Qian Qian 21st telegram. After the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army in the Longchuanhe Valley on the west bank of the Nujiang River, it has begun to annihilate the Yu army. The results of the battle before the encirclement formed on the evening of the 16th have been clarified as follows: Yu army corpses 600, prisoners 30. Confiscated artillery 3, heavy mortars 1, heavy machine guns 1, light machine guns 5, rifles 49, and a lot of other ammunition, fodder, and clothing. According to the prisoners, the commander of the 36th Division of the wounded Yu army had fled to the west bank of the Nujiang River on the 15th. The army suffered heavy losses due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army. A part of the Yu army suffered more than 300 casualties near Lunma (60 kilometers northwest of Tengyue), and then became fragmented. The Yu army in that area seems to have completely fallen into chaos due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army, and its losses will be far greater than what the Japanese side has clarified.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops on the Yunnan Border Cross the Nujiang River</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) The new operation launched by the Japanese army in the Gaoligong Mountains seems to have given the Yu regime a great shock. According to the telegram, the Kunming American 14th Air Force Command announced on the 19th that the American Air Force would cover the operations of the Yu army's land forces and send bombs to the Japanese army's ammunition depot in Liuku, east of the Nujiang River. Therefore, foreign correspondents in Chongqing believe that the Japanese army has actually crossed the Nujiang River. Correspondents from the Associated Press and other reports stated that the anti-Axis army wanted to launch an operation to recapture Burma, but the Japanese army seized the initiative and had begun a new operation on the Yunnan-Burma border. The most recent action seems to have crossed the Nujiang River and secured the bridgehead. Liang Hanshen, the propaganda minister of the Yu side, talked about the announcement of the US military command at a meeting with the press corps on the 20th. Foreign correspondents questioned whether the news was true. Liang replied that the Japanese troops in the four parts of Burma and Yunnan have recently shown signs of increasing in strength. It is currently unknown whether the Japanese army's operational intention is to attack Chongqing or to attack India. As for whether the Japanese army has crossed the Nujiang River, detailed information can be inquired from the Che Military Commission. However, the Yu Military Commission announced the battle situation, only stating that the Japanese army is still operating on the west bank of the Nujiang River, so it is still impossible to judge whether the announcement of the US military command is true and whether the US planes have bombed the Japanese army in Liuku. In short, the new operation of the Japanese army has plunged the Yu side and the US military stationed in Yu into chaos.</p>

<h3>Allied Reinforcements Aim for Concentrated Offensive, Landing in Rome Area Proves Difficult</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Overseas Shipping News, the war situation on the eastern front in southern Italy is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, only preliminary skirmishes are occurring, and the Allied forces do not have the initiative. After the German forces counterattacked on the 18th of this month and drove the British and Canadian forces out of a certain small town, they defeated a unit of American forces northeast of Capua the day before yesterday. The American forces withdrew from a certain area after fierce fighting and suffered heavy losses. The Allied attempt at a concentrated offensive has been hampered, and the destruction of transportation infrastructure and adverse weather conditions are also unfavorable to the Allied forces. However, the Allied waiting stage seems to be nearing its end. General Clark has concentrated most of the American Fifth Army on the north bank of the Volturno River and the Calore River. The main force of the British Eighth Army has also approached the front lines. General Montgomery's spearhead has clearly increased pressure west of the line from Venafro to Isernia and west of Biferno. It is said that the Allied forces have received considerable reinforcements by sea in recent days, including two divisions that were General Montgomery's main forces in the African and Sicilian campaigns. They suffered heavy losses in the Sicilian campaign but have been replenished and reorganized and are currently being transferred to Italy, indicating that the Allied forces will launch a concentrated offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to German News Agency reports: Well-informed sources in Italy say that the Allied forces are preparing to launch a landing in the vicinity of Rome from the air and sea in the near future. A large number of troops transported by Anglo-American air power have already concentrated behind their lines, and the intense activity of the Anglo-American forces in the port of Naples also foreshadows major action to come. This speculation is also supported by the frequent movement of ships along the southwestern Italian coast by the Allied forces. Military circles in Berlin also confidently believe this news, because the source has contact with both Italian parties and is known for the accuracy of its information. Followers of Badoglio, who are dissatisfied with the Allied forces and wish to curry favor with the German side in order to establish themselves in the government of the Fascist Republic of Italy, are willing to provide important information as a means of advancement. In addition, the intensified air force activity of the Anglo-American forces on the main roads on both the eastern and western sides of Italy and their reorganization of troops on the front lines can also serve as further evidence of a large-scale Allied operation. This may be because General Eisenhower also knows that attacking the German mountain positions will result in heavy losses and may not succeed, so he will launch an offensive in a direction that deviates from our expectations to relieve the heavy pressure that the American Fifth Army is currently under from the British Eighth Army.</p>
<h3>Southeast of Krivoi Rog, Soviets Increase Pressure, German Reinforcements Steadily Counterattack</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Overseas Shipping News, the focus of the Soviet offensive remains southeast of Krivoi Rog. The Soviet army is attempting to create a large gap for a weekend breakthrough there. The pressure from the wedge-shaped offensive from Krivoi Rog to Dnepropetrovsk has not lessened. Furthermore, the offensive is being intensified with the assistance of artillery and tanks. The German army is deploying reinforcements to the front lines, which is another reason why the Soviet army is boldly using its current superiority in manpower and material resources. The German army is steadily counterattacking, and the outcome is still difficult to predict. However, the outcome of this battle will affect the situation in the Dnieper River estuary and the fighting around Zaporozhye to the Sea of Azov. The German forces defending the gateway to the Nogai Steppe are also under intense attack. The fighting there is clearly related to the attempt to break through towards Krivoi Rog. The other battles are not as important as those in the southern sector, but Soviet attacks north of Crimea, northwest of Chernigov, near Gomel, and south of Nevel have all been repelled after fierce fighting. There is only local warfare between Gomel and Nevel in the central sector. The concentration of Soviet forces in the Leningrad region and south of Lake Ladoga indicates that the Soviet army may launch an offensive there.</p>
<p>The German Side Emphasizes This Battle</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency reports: The Soviet army is making its greatest effort in the fighting in the southeastern Krivoi Rog region, but the breakthrough has not yet been expanded. The area where the Soviet army has penetrated deep into the German positions forms a triangle with Krivoi Rog and Dnepropetrovsk as the base and a point trending southwest. The Soviet army seems to be exerting its power from this vertex towards the south and north. The German command, recognizing the Soviet army's superiority in numbers, has deliberately withdrawn the first-line positions to the rear to gradually block the offensive of the main Soviet forces. According to news from the front lines, although the weather has been bad in recent days, fierce fighting continues. Both the German and Soviet armies are carrying out large-scale mobilization. In particular, the German air force is extremely active and has greatly reduced the effectiveness of the Soviet artillery positions. The outcome of the Battle of Krivoi Rog will have a major impact on all sides. Currently, the German command is adopting a strategy of retreating defensively combined with counterattacks, conserving its forces as much as possible in preparation for winter operations.</p>
<p>Fighting Remains Fierce</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency reports: The major battles in the areas of Melitopol, northwest of Dnepropetrovsk, north of Crimea, south of Gomel, and along the Nevel River continued on Tuesday, with the intensity undiminished. The Soviet offensive is again heavily focused northwest of Dnepropetrovsk, where the Red Army is continuously deploying fresh troops, especially launching intense attacks on the base of the gap in that area. The Soviet army is using super-heavy tanks and the most powerful howitzers, mortars, and platoon guns to try to widen these gaps, but the German grenadiers are putting up a strong resistance and, undeterred by the enemy's fierce artillery fire, are using quick-firing automatic weapons to cut down the Soviet infantry columns in the trenches. The leading Soviet tank units in the trenches are closely followed by motorized infantry units in front of the battle. The accurate targeting of the German artillery fire has forced the Soviet motorized units to dismount in order to defend themselves. In this battle, German tanks destroyed seventeen Soviet tanks, rendering them immobile.</p>
<p>The Soviet Army Cannot Widen the Gap</p>
<p>The Red Army launched a fierce assault on the German mountain positions, but the German defenders resolutely resisted the enemy's fierce attacks. The Soviet army used all available troops, adding them to the battle more than twenty times. Although the Soviet army used several regiments and tank groups, as well as a large number of fire weapons and infantry artillery, it failed to penetrate the German lines at any point. The Soviet army also deployed reinforcements of at least five regiments and a large number of tank corps from the north in the northern sector of the gap, attempting to tear apart the German flank in order to widen the gap. Fierce fighting immediately broke out, with both sides suffering losses. Afterward, the enemy forces were repelled to the narrow bridgehead positions on the Dnieper River. In some places, they were even repelled to the islands in the river. North of the Sea of Azov, the Soviet army again tried to penetrate the Melitopol lines, but was again repelled to its original positions. A gap north of the town was immediately eliminated after a German counterattack. As a result, the Red Army was unable to make any use of this gap.</p>
<h3>Gambara Appointed Chief of Staff of the Italian Army</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a dispatch from Rome, the Italian Minister of Defense announced on the 20th the appointment of General Gambara as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. Gambara, now 53 years old, commanded Alpine troops during World War I and achieved meritorious service. Later, during the Ethiopian War, he served as Chief of Staff of the 1st Blackshirt Division and achieved great success. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Blackshirts and was wounded in battle, promoted to lieutenant general, and awarded the Knight's Cross. In 1939, he served as the Italian ambassador to Spain. After the outbreak of this war, he took office as commander of the 4th Army and participated in the capture of Mont-Dauphin (southern France).</p>

However, official sources here believe that an Anglo-American invasion of Western Europe would inevitably fail. Most of the French people hope that the Anglo-Americans will choose another location in Europe as a battlefield so that France can be spared the ravages of a second war.</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture</h3>
<p>Thorough Mobilization of the People</p>
<p>This strengthening of the domestic situation focuses on three points: expanding air combat capabilities, achieving food self-sufficiency, and thoroughly strengthening national defense labor. The national mobilization, in addition to military mobilization, focuses on expanding air combat capabilities. The seven points highlighted in the national mobilization policy are all goals that are currently presented to the people and urgently need to be materialized. In short, the people's cooperation in this regard depends on how the government fosters national morale on the path to achieving these goals and ensuring their accomplishment.</p>
<p>Past national mobilizations lacked organic connections to the progress of the war situation and the corresponding production relations. The national movement led by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association failed to organically connect the labor allocation in important industries and the labor services resulting from overall infrastructure development with production relations, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>In order to cope with "the urgent period of concentrating everything on a decisive war," national mobilization must possess an organic unity with these production relations. The awareness of the intensification of the war situation has already arisen in every citizen. The enthusiasm of youth throughout the country, not just students, but also in factories and rural areas, should be channeled into patriotic sentiments. Elevating the fervent enthusiasm of the youth at this moment is the essence of strengthening national mobilization. Therefore, the government must consider measures to ensure that the people thoroughly understand the new policies of the current situation, further clarify the national character of enterprises, and thoroughly rationalize the salary system, which are the keys to the success or failure of national mobilization. If the government first aims to initiate new mobilization among the people and eliminate the unpatriotic private lives still present among some citizens, it can be said to have laid the foundation for thoroughly implementing national mobilization.</p>
<p>Progress of Mobilization Plan</p>
<p>The seven points listed in the national mobilization policy are: first, expanding the scope of conscription for military mobilization; second, for students, suspending the deferment of conscription for liberal arts students and maintaining the current age limit for compulsory youth education; third, universalizing the requisition of male labor; fourth, promoting female labor; fifth, utilizing the surplus mobilization power generated by the streamlining of personnel from government-affiliated organizations and regulatory agencies, and the abolition of service year limits; sixth, allocating laborers to appropriate positions to ensure their efficient utilization. These are all measures that should naturally be taken to substantially increase aircraft production.</p>
<p>Without air superiority, there is no victory. The government has already begun implementing a 24-hour system to increase aircraft production, with a particular focus on the allocation of labor and materials. All national mobilization measures are tailored to this requirement of concentrating expanded combat capabilities on aircraft. Prohibiting men from easily choosing non-essential professions, strengthening female mobilization, and suspending liberal arts education are all measures taken directly and indirectly to increase aircraft production, ensure sufficient labor, and achieve previously set goals.</p>
<p>Japan's national mobilization, along with the progress of the China Incident, began planning for labor needs in the Showa 14th year (1939). Since then, each year it has been determined as part of the national plan under the name of the Labor Mobilization Plan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it abandoned the character of simply partial labor mobilization. From the Showa 17th year (1942), it was renamed the National Mobilization Plan. Labor mobilization only reached a perfect stage after encouraging all citizens to work. In the Showa 15th year (1940) plan, unemployed women were the target of labor mobilization and were given as a source of new labor. In the 16th year (1941), in addition to general laborers, there were plans to use so-called labor service to fill a part of temporary seasonal labor, and the mobilization plan indicated a transition from labor sufficiency to national labor. The Great East Asia War had a great impact on labor administration. After the outbreak of the war, the National Labor Service Cooperation Order was promulgated and implemented, opening the way for citizens to directly serve in groups in general mobilization work. Therefore, the mobilization plans for the 17th and 18th years (1942 and 1943) broke into the preparation of national total mobilization work. Qualitative mobilization and optimization of requisition were being worked on to realize the transformation and allocation of each person's abilities into the professional categories that the state deems necessary.</p>
<p>Refreshing Labor Domestic Policy</p>
<p>An organic consistency is required between the labor mobilization for increasing military production and the production relations. Therefore, concrete measures within the government must be handled more closely and quickly between the related departments. The administrative operations of the Army, Navy, Ministry of Munitions, and Ministry of Health and Welfare should not "lose time" due to conflicts of authority in the future. In order to carry out the purpose of the decisive battle administration of "production first principle", the methods of administrative operation should be further simplified, strengthened and powerfully implemented from the viewpoint of the production responsibility system. Measures to prevent the transfer of full-time officials at the bureau chief and section chief levels in important production departments, and to thoroughly grasp production matters in the future, should also be considered.</p>
<p>When we observe the course of labor administration to date, as seen in the revision and abolition of the National Requisition Order and other related orders in the spring of this year, labor administration has always followed behind the reality of production. From the perspective of refreshing labor administration, there should be measures to strengthen the connection with production administration.</p>
<p>For labor mobilization to adapt to the principle of production first, civilian production control groups and the Industrial Service Association, which is the center of the industrial service movement, should take closer measures in terms of joint labor, and hope for a leap forward in adapting to the new situation of the industrial service movement.</p>
<p>Labor Efficiency</p>
<p>The supply and demand of labor is quite urgent, as seen in the strengthening of conscription, and the solution to this problem, labor efficiency, is becoming more and more attention. To be more precise, the lack of smooth material distribution and the uneven distribution of labor are being discussed as bottlenecks in enhancing production. At the same time, the imbalance between materials and labor must also be considered. In order to utilize materials and improve efficiency, the enterprise group system should be adopted, and the allocation of laborers should also be implemented with this industrial group as a unit. As the system organization of the general, branch, and cooperative factories is completed with the enterprise consolidation, it goes without saying that even at present, the circulation of skilled labor and the circulation of materials within the same region and the same enterprise should be utilized as much as possible to increase production. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has already admitted that most of the government-managed factories and other important munitions factories, the so-called general factories, in order to complete production by the designated date, may dispatch laborers from the general factories to the branch factories and cooperative factories.</p>
<p>The appropriate allocation of labor is a corrective measure for the uneven distribution of labor, and this has also been proposed this time, so its significance is extremely important. As a result of the rapid conversion of spinning factories, which are at the top of enterprise consolidation, equipment and laborers are included in the government's unified control range, resulting in many inadequacies in the use of laborers' abilities (Excerpted from the Western Asahi Shimbun on September 26).</p>

<h3>Meeting of Regional Directors of the Grain Control Association Yesterday - Instructions on Future Policies for Purchasing Grain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Grain Control Committee convened a meeting of directors and deputy directors of regional offices at 10:00 AM yesterday. The meeting was attended by Chairman Yuan Lvdeng, Vice Chairmen Hirono Junichi and Chen Guoquan, Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu, Directors Chen Zihui, Yan Jiyun, Shen Lin, Ueda Kenjiro, and Dai Fu, as well as the directors and deputy directors of regional offices, totaling 43 people from the Nanjing region Zhu Zun.

I believe you are all aware of the organization's objectives. I have been entrusted by the government to oversee the unified purchase and distribution of grain throughout the country. I am approaching this difficult task with the goal of living up to the government's trust and the people's expectations. Grain procurement is urgent and cannot be delayed. Regional offices should be established immediately. This is why we are here to discuss this with each other, and I hope that you will all work hard according to my instructions to complete this great mission. However, if there are any mistakes, the association will impose severe punishments." Secretary Zhou then elaborated on the differences between the previous and current regional offices, stating, "In the past, the regional offices of the Joint Operating Company were responsible for purchasing grain. Now, the purchase work of the association has been entrusted to the local industry preparedness committees. The regional offices of the association now have organizational regulations and detailed procedures for handling affairs, which are available for your review. The most important task is to inspect the quality of the grain, such as issuing transportation permits, processing and storage, and paying for the grain." Finally, Chen Zihui, director of the Storage and Distribution Department of the association, instructed the offices on the methods of inspecting the grain, and Dai Fu, director of the Finance Department, instructed on the financial procedures and the preparation of estimates. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and was scheduled to continue at 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 22nd).</p>
<h3>Designated Retailers for Soap and Matches - 367 Stores - General Sales Expected to Begin Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The rationed distribution of soap and matches has been decided and will be piloted in the first and second districts. If successful, it will be extended to all districts of the city. The relevant procedures have also been actively promoted by the authorities of the two districts. Purchase certificates have been issued, and general sales are expected to begin around the first day of next month. As for the retailers selling rationed soap and matches, the industry association of each district submitted a list of member stores to the authorities for review. The authorities then sent personnel to verify the information and designated 367 stores, all of which are Class A stores of Datong and Xiaotong. The Economic Division of the First District has prepared a list, which will be officially announced within days. Notification letters have been issued, instructing the designated retailers to handle contract signing and other matters as soon as possible in order to implement the distribution and stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Payment of Security Deposits</p>
<p>According to reporters of the Commercial News, the authorities of the two districts have set a deadline of noon on the 22nd for the retailers who will be implementing the plan to submit the required security deposits (divided into Class A and Class B) to the Economic Division at 209 Jiangxi Road. They will begin picking up the goods three days later, for sales starting early next month.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Deliveryman Apprehended for Forcibly Selling Newspapers Under False Pretenses - Handed Over to Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Cases of using false pretenses to deceive and force people to purchase newspapers and magazines are frequently heard of in the city. Recently, the China Daily News discovered that someone was boldly claiming to be from the "Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government" to forcibly sell the newspaper and collect subscription fees. After learning of this, the newspaper immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. Yesterday (the 21st), the newspaper deliveryman Wang Qingshan, who was in charge of delivering and collecting fees, was apprehended. After detailed questioning, he confessed that the mastermind behind the scheme was Chuan Jien, who resided at 226 West Shixing Road (from Dinghai, Zhejiang), and was a former subscription employee of the China Book and Newspaper Agency. The newspaper then went to the address, apprehended Chuan, and confirmed the facts. The newspaper then handed him over to the Hongkou Police Department for investigation according to law. Although such incidents are not uncommon in Shanghai, newspaper authorities deeply resent them, but have been unable to investigate due to the public's forbearance. Fortunately, this case has been uncovered, and it is hoped that the unscrupulous elements will refrain from such acts in the future.</p>
<p>Talk by Publicity Department Advisor Feng Jie</p>
<p>Because the suspect claimed to be from the Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government, the reporter interviewed Feng Jie, advisor to the Publicity Department, to inquire about his views on the matter. He made the following statement: "The National Government's Publicity Department has explicitly prohibited the forced sale of newspapers and magazines. Now, the China Daily News has discovered that someone in the city is boldly claiming to be from the Publicity and News Promotion Department of the National Government to deceive the public and forcibly sell the newspaper, which is absurd. The newspaper itself has its own value and should be trusted without the need for such sales tactics. In addition to the newspaper investigating the suspect and handing him over to the competent authorities for investigation according to law, I, on behalf of the Publicity Department, would like to declare that we hope the public will understand this, be cautious, and not be easily deceived. We also hope that there will be no more such unscrupulous elements who try to test the law."</p>
<h3>Central China Railway Actively Rectifying Railway Administration</h3>
<p>The Central China Railway Company has a workforce of 30,000 Chinese employees, accounting for three-fifths of the total staff. Because these employees were hired too quickly after the incident and are of mixed backgrounds, the administrative operations are not smooth. When the new organization was reformed on August 1 of this year, the Railway Academy was established to specialize in two departments: general and specialized. In addition to selecting outstanding employees from various railways to attend lectures and training to enhance their knowledge and skills, recruitment for general department students will begin once the dormitory repairs are completed. Graduates of secondary schools are eligible to apply. Recently, the company appointed Councillor Hu Yi, president of the Railway Academy, as an investigator to go to North China and Manchuria to investigate the railway education administration. President Hu is scheduled to depart in early November, first going to Manchuria to inspect the South and North Manchuria Railways, and then to North China.</p>

<h3>Coal Ball Panic Not Reduced - Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation - Strict Investigation of Concealment and Refusal to Sell</h3>
<p>The situation regarding the supply of essential fuel coal balls has not yet returned to normal. Residents are urgently seeking to purchase them at black market prices from nearby retailers. Residents have repeatedly requested the authorities to find ways to thoroughly improve the situation and send personnel to secretly investigate the truth in order to adjust the current supply situation. According to a reliable source, the authorities, recognizing that coal balls are an essential item for cooking for low-income residents, no less important than rice, are urging manufacturers to increase production and actively clear large quantities of raw materials to reduce production costs. At the same time, they are sending a large number of personnel to the districts under their jurisdiction to secretly investigate the sale of coal balls by retailers. If any of the following situations are found, no matter who is involved, no leniency will be shown, and the matter will be strictly investigated according to law: those who have coal balls but refuse to sell them, or even hide them in secret places to deceive people; those who illegally raise market prices (limited to 32.5 yuan per dan); those who illegally profit; and those who reduce the quantity (100 jin per dan) or mix in impurities. If residents are aware of any such activities, they are encouraged to report them to the nearest police station so that a thorough investigation can be conducted.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Retail Sales - Limited to Five Yuan Per Purchase</h3>
<p>Reporters from the Central News visited the Coal Ball Industry Association to inquire about the difficulty in purchasing coal balls recently. According to them, the coal balls distributed by the association's member manufacturers to retailers are sufficient to meet the needs of the city. However, due to fears of rising coal ball prices or concerns about coal ball shortages, users are hoarding coal balls, creating opportunities for retailers to sell them at high prices on the black market. The association is currently working hard to thoroughly investigate this situation and has strictly established four rules: Retail sales of coal balls are limited to five yuan per purchase to prevent users from purchasing and hoarding large quantities, and to prevent retailers from reselling them in bulk on the black market at high prices; retailers are not allowed to sell goods midway to avoid fraud; retailers must strictly adhere to the limited price of 32.5 yuan and are not allowed to raise prices; and retailers who violate any of the above three rules will have their distribution rights immediately suspended. The association will strictly enforce these four rules.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Widening the Narrow Road to Increased Production</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the focus of wartime production was on encouraging various emerging industries with wartime production potential, rather than just supporting existing production industries. The significance of this is to widen the narrow road to increased production. Wherever it can be widened, it should be widened as much as possible in order to circulate the economy and reduce the congestion of idle funds in the market. Therefore, the general public is uneasy about the stock review issue for emerging industries, which is the meaning of this.</p>
<p>Now, among the second batch of newly transferred enemy properties, there are also 21 cases related to enterprises, many of which are related to various production industries. This can certainly be regarded as another widening of the narrow road to increased production. What we should strive for in the future is exactly what the spokesperson of the New Enemy Property Management Committee said at the transfer ceremony held the other day: "Our efforts in managing enemy properties have always been aimed at increasing production. For example, for factories that have already started production, we must ensure their continued development. For factories that have not yet started production, we must find ways to start production." Undoubtedly, this is the wish that everyone in the production sector holds, and it is not just starting today.</p>
<p>What we need to supplement now is that, in terms of seeking people, the raw materials for factories after they are taken over can obtain the generous assistance of the Allied authorities, ensuring that there is no shortage of raw material allocation and no obstruction to the transportation of raw materials. In terms of self-reliance, the management of factories after they are taken over must be pragmatic and strive for excellence, especially focusing on the training of technical personnel, the improvement of labor welfare, and the increase of production efficiency, so as to jointly contribute to the wartime economic system. Only then will we live up to the goodwill of the Allied transfer.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Special Committee - Actively Purchasing Raw Materials - Edible Oil from North China is Now Being Shipped to Shanghai Continuously</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce's work of purchasing oil and grain is being carried out with utmost effort. The association has already ordered a large amount of edible oil from North China, which is currently being shipped by land. At the same time, the association is also quite active in purchasing raw materials for oil extraction. The above-mentioned measures will make the supply of edible oil more abundant, and the oil extraction factories that have been shut down in various places will also be able to resume work with the allocation of raw materials.</p>
<p>Purchasing Categories</p>
<p>It is learned from the committee that the scope of raw material purchases for oil extraction is very broad and can be divided into three categories: Miscellaneous grains, including soybeans, mung beans, black beans, sorghum, and corn, etc. Oilseeds, including cypress seeds, peanuts, tung seeds, sesame seeds, castor seeds, etc. Bones, including beef bones and pork bones, etc.</p>
<p>Branch Offices</p>
<p>The committee also noted that various oil and grain raw materials are mostly scattered in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In order to achieve good collection results and facilitate unified management, it has imitated the method of purchasing wheat and established branch offices in the three provinces. It is planned to establish eleven units in total: Nantong, Haimen, and Shanghai in Jiangsu Province; Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing; Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province; and Wuhu, Anqing, and Bengbu in Anhui Province. The organization of each branch office is striving to be strong in order to achieve the effectiveness of collection work.

<h3>Banks Prepare to Cope with the Year-End Period - Extra Caution in Reviewing New Loans</h3>
<p>The year-end period for industry and commerce is approaching in the blink of an eye. Banks have made separate preparations and, in accordance with custom, notify that all credit loans expiring at the end of the year will be fully repaid before the end of the year in order to maintain the inherent commercial credit. However, for reputable firms, an extension will be granted, but the maximum extension shall not exceed six months. As for new long-term credit loans, in accordance with national laws and regulations and the resolutions of the joint meetings of banks, efforts will be made to tighten them. Therefore, the review of new loans is particularly cautious and limited to the proper development of productive enterprises. At the same time, contracts must be signed and solvent guarantors must be obtained. It is also heard that industry and commerce have made their own preparations for the year-end issue and are confident that they will be able to smoothly pass this period. In addition, the Money Trade Association has regularly convened a year-end internal market meeting to publicly decide on the "year-end internal market exchange rate."</p>
<h3>First District Health Department Issues Weekly Health Tips - How to Eradicate Smallpox</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: In Shanghai, where the population is dense, it is truly not easy to maintain good health. First, one must understand the principles of hygiene and adhere to them unremittingly in order to maintain health and increase resistance to disease. During epidemics, extreme caution and prevention are required. If unfortunately infected, immediate treatment and isolation are necessary to prevent the spread. Promoting public health and preventing infectious diseases are the duties of the health authorities, but in order to achieve perfection, it is necessary for every citizen to cooperate enthusiastically. Unless personal hygiene is promoted first, success cannot be achieved. The Health Department of the First District Public Office has recognized this and has compiled a series of Health Tips to increase the general public's knowledge of hygiene, which are published weekly in newspapers in the city for reference.</p>
<p>Preventing Smallpox</p>
<p>Smallpox, commonly known as "chugantou," is a very terrible infectious disease. Contracting this disease is not only life-threatening for the patient, but it is also easy to transmit the disease to others, and it spreads very quickly. Smallpox is mostly transmitted through direct contact with the patient, but the patient's clothes, bedding, and all utensils used by the patient are also media for indirect transmission of smallpox. The general public always believes that smallpox only affects infants. When you get older, you won't get it anymore. This is a very big mistake. In fact, no matter how old you are, there is a possibility of contracting smallpox. However, adults who contract smallpox do not have a higher mortality rate than children. Due to the efforts of governments and people in other countries in the world, this disease has disappeared. On the contrary, smallpox still occurs frequently in various parts of our country, which cannot be said to be a shameful event. In fact, the prevention method for smallpox is easier and more effective than any other infectious disease. Now I will talk about the common knowledge about preventing smallpox, and at the same time introduce the steps taken by the Health Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City to prevent smallpox:</p>
<p>Vaccination Prevents Smallpox</p>
<p>Only vaccination can prevent smallpox. Besides vaccination, there is no other good way to prevent it. Our knowledge of vaccination is very common. We have had knowledge of vaccination for more than ten years, but because we are confined to superstition, we must choose a lucky day or wait until the Flower Birthday (February 12th of the lunar calendar) before we are willing to get vaccinated. Little do we know how many infants have been infected with smallpox and died before the Flower Birthday. This is so miserable and painful.</p>
<p>Every year on the Flower Birthday, thousands of infants go to the branches of the Health Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special City to get vaccinated. This is an impressive sight, but we also mourn for the many infants who are delayed in vaccination and suffer misfortune. Parents, you must know that this health department vaccinates the public all year round.</p>
<p>Remember, children can be vaccinated within one or two weeks after birth. At the latest, they must be vaccinated before they are one month old. There is no need to wait for the arrival of the Flower Birthday. You can go to the nearest health branch at any time to get vaccinated. It doesn't cost a penny and only takes five minutes to completely prevent this terrible smallpox.</p>
<p>What to Do If You Get Smallpox</p>
<p>What should I do if I unfortunately get smallpox? Generally speaking, people still follow the old customs and lock the patient in a room, not allowing any visitors to come in to see them, and sealing the windows tightly with paper, fearing that the patient will see the light and be exposed to evil winds, making the room gloomy and unable to breathe in a bit of fresh air. Before medicine was developed, in those remote rural areas where there was no sanitation equipment, we cannot deny that this room naturally became an isolation ward, preventing many people from being infected. It seems that it also has its advantages, but let us think about it, in densely populated Shanghai, there are few houses and many people. A house is full of more than a dozen families. Once someone contracts smallpox, can you still isolate the patient? The local health authorities have long established a complete isolation hospital for infectious patients. If there is a smallpox patient in the family, don't hide the patient like before. Quickly send him to the isolation hospital. After the patient arrives at the hospital, the health department will immediately send someone to the patient's residence to disinfect it, and will vaccinate everyone who has been in contact with the patient, regardless of gender, age, or child. Only by doing this can the patient be saved, and you will also be saved.</p>
<p>How to Eradicate Smallpox</p>
<p>The following methods are all easy to do. I hope that all residents of the city will earnestly abide by them and work together to help the health authorities eradicate this terrible smallpox.</p>
<p>After a baby is born, whether it is winter or summer, it must be vaccinated before the baby is one month old at the latest.</p>
<p>Regardless of age, children and adults need to be revaccinated every three years. You can go to the nearest health branch to get vaccinated for free.</p>
<p>Do not visit patients with smallpox to prevent infection.</p>
<p>Smallpox patients must be sent to the isolation hospital for treatment immediately to avoid infecting others. The isolation hospital of the First District Public Office is located at 163 Beihai Road.</p>
<p>After the patient arrives at the hospital, do not move or hide his clothes, bedding, and all utensils that have been used. Let the health department send someone to take them away completely. After the disinfection is complete, send them back for reuse. The health department does not charge for this procedure.</p>
<p>After smallpox is discovered in the family, those who have been in contact with the patient, or their relatives and friends, whether or not they have been vaccinated, must allow the health department to send someone to vaccinate them. Do not choose. If any uncomfortable or suspicious symptoms are found within sixteen days, you must immediately report to the health department or consult a doctor to determine whether you have been infected with smallpox.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Orphanage and Kindergarten - The Unified Teaching and Management System</h3>
<p>The kindergarten is full of vitality, but at the same time, there is also very strict management. They implement a "unified teaching and management system." Teachers, in addition to their teaching duties, must also be responsible for training and management. Therefore, they are all full-time and work in the院 all day long. They share the joys and sorrows of the students in their daily lives, and they "practice what they preach" as a model. In terms of teaching, it is even stricter. They regularly examine the students' academic performance and conduct. Those who are too poor and unmanageable are required to drop out of school. There are currently five resident staff members in the 院: one director of 院 affairs, one accountant and medical doctor, one provider and administrator, one cleaner and outdoor worker, and one nurse. There are six male and female workers. Under the "unified teaching and management system," the classrooms during the day are converted into bedrooms at night, with teachers and books. Under the principle of economy, the gymnasium also serves as a dining room and a recreation room. Meals are divided into two times, each time divided into several groups, each group of eight children, each with a group leader.</p>
<p>The kindergarten pays great attention to the children's upbringing. It has always cooperated with children's protection organizations and has fixed nourishment. There are standards for daily food and nutrition, and there are records. Currently, 250 kilograms of grain are made every day, of which rice accounts for one-third, sweet potatoes account for one-quarter, and the rest are red beans, wheat flour, corn flour, etc. One meal and two congees are stipulated every day, all cooked with water, so fuel is saved. Vegetables and oil, etc., cost at least 150 yuan per day, and dozens of yuan are added for teachers and staff. Rice is applied for from the district office, 13 packages per month, each package containing 1 shi and 2 dou and a half. Sweet potatoes, etc. are purchased nearby, and other foods are purchased in large quantities, making the price cheaper. Coal balls and coal layers can also be paid at half price. Therefore, in the past, the food cost was more economical than usual, averaging no more than 100 yuan per person per month. However, now, due to the continuous rise in prices, the nutritional standards have to be gradually reduced. All rely on their special attention to nutrition, so it does not greatly affect health.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing and bedding, each child generally has two sets of single clothes, one set of cotton-padded clothes, and two pairs of shoes. It is still visible that they are clean. Shoes are mostly not available. Most of the quilts are made of cotton blankets and are similar to army life. Each month, every two children have four or five blankets, which is enough. The cost of clothing and bedding for each child is about 10 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The health of the children in the past was not very good. Most of them were infected with scabies, lice, etc. Therefore, a medical room and a ward were set up, and a resident nurse was hired to preside over all medical and health affairs in the 院. Older children learn to work as assistants. Check in groups every day. Each person also has a check card. Soon scabies disappeared, and lice and pinkeye also decreased. Usually, washing is implemented. Bathing is forced, so the health status is gradually improving. There are also major hospitals of the former 工部局 Health Department and Western doctors Jiang Zhimian, Ge Futing, Guo Shu, Chen Zhanyuan, Guo Xingsun, Zhou Shuxiang, Fengsun, Mao Shouzhang, Gong Yangxian, and traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhao Guanfu, etc., who regularly go to the 院 for free diagnosis. In case of serious illness, they are sent to the isolation hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Shanghai Civilian Tuberculosis Hospital, and the Yiyou Hospital. The China Leder Association and the Jimin Hospital are even close at hand, so the health of the children has been fully guaranteed.</p>
<p>Career and Future</p>
<p>From the small Shanghai Kindergarten, we can see the bright future of China, but we can also see that on the way to "light", there are many thorns.</p>
<p>The highest organizational volume of the kindergarten is the board of directors. The reasons for their presence are that they are well-known and enthusiastic people in social undertakings. The executive board includes Chairman Zhang Wenkui, Vice Chairman Chen Xuanzhe, Finance Director Zhu Lianxiang, Director Lin Hou, and Deputy Director Zhang Jusheng. Below the board of directors is the actual working organization of the main and branch 院s. The person in charge of the main 院 is 院 Affairs Director Ruan Bin, who presides over the three sections of affairs, teaching, and production, and the 院 Student Activities Guidance Committee. The teaching section currently has three teachers, and the general affairs section has six clerks, who are responsible for accounting, documents, supply, medical affairs, general affairs, and outdoor work. In addition to Director Li Heling, the production department also has one administrator and 师傅s from each production department. Chen Renyuan is the director of the Xu Gongqiao Branch. On the teaching side, there are three teachers, and two people for affairs and production. They use fewer people to teach the 260 "Little Heroes" in the two 院s (160 in the main 院 and 100 in the branch 院). Everyone cultivates talents for the country and society with a spirit of selfless dedication and harmony. Their treatment is very poor. The director does not receive a salary. In addition to providing very simple meals and accommodation for the teachers and staff of the 佳院, they only receive hundreds of yuan in salary. However, due to the continuous rise in prices, the 院's expenses are still very tight. Last winter, they purchased assistance from the Shanghai City Relief Association. After the investigation by the two members of Huan Huanquan and Li Lin, they believed that it was worth subsidizing. The standing committee of the association decided to subsidize 7,000 yuan per month starting from January of this year until March. Later, it was decided to continue subsidizing 11,000 yuan, totaling 32,000 yuan. Recently, according to 院 Director Ruan, the funds are already on the verge of exhaustion, and the bank has already overdrawn, so they are preparing to launch the fourth fundraising campaign. It is hoped that the fundraising will be successful and the foundation will be sufficient, so that the industries of the main 院 can progress, and the agricultural and commercial income of the branch 院 can be sufficient, and it is possible to reach self-sufficiency, and also expand the number of teaching and education industries and the number of adopted persons with surplus energy. Then, the education and upbringing of Shanghai's suffering children can achieve greater results. (The End)</p>

<h3>Opinions on Improving Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>— Law</p>
<p>In recent years, as a result of the continuous rise in the cost of living, most school-age children and young people, except for a very few lucky ones, have been excluded from school—dropping out of school. From the perspective of the country, society, or oneself, this is undoubtedly a major damage to education and culture. Therefore, adapting to this trend, scholarship campaigns and volunteer teaching work have flourished in recent years. Although this is almost a passive educational relief endeavor, who can ignore this aspect!</p>
<p>Today, those engaged in volunteer teaching in Shanghai are mostly working youth or student youth. Their engagement in education is driven more by enthusiasm and interest than by volition. This is a common occurrence. Several young people with similar interests come together, raise some funds, and then rent school buildings, put up enrollment advertisements, purchase teaching materials, and test new students. A volunteer school is thus born. Thanks to the enthusiasm of these non-professional educators, the number of schools is quite promising. However, they are ultimately outsiders, and education is not something that can be accomplished with temporary enthusiasm. Therefore, if we peel back the surface of quantity and delve deeper, we believe there is a need for further exploration. "Cheap optimism" does more harm than good.</p>
<p>What is education? This is still a contentious issue. I don't want to discuss this big topic here, but if we say that education is not just about knowing a few characters, no one can deny this. Therefore, to achieve this educational goal, it may not be possible for amateur educators who only understand educational principles and have enthusiasm to do it! In one volunteer school I saw, it was run by twenty-odd working youths, so there were twenty-odd teachers. In this situation of too many monks and not enough porridge, on the school's daily schedule, the Chinese language subject for the same grade is taught by several different people. Zhang San yesterday, Li Si today, tomorrow... Leaving aside the educational principles, such a superficial teaching method, even the so-called extremely narrow literal education of merely knowing a few characters, would be greatly discounted. The emotional connection between teachers and students, the personality of students, etc., outside of literal education, are naturally out of the question. I deeply admire their motivation and enthusiasm for teaching. However, from the standpoint of an educator, this cannot but be said to be a failure of education.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of teaching materials, which is also handled with numerous errors. The new education advocates a "child-centered" approach, where the child is the center of teaching, the teacher's role is merely a guide, and the teaching materials are even more so. In volunteer schools with simple facilities and unqualified teachers, this is an excessive desire. However, the teaching materials should be based on and suitable for the needs and level of the students. This should not be wrong! However, they are too hasty in this regard. According to what I know, one volunteer school teaches complex fractions in the sixth grade—which is of no use in students' daily lives—and another volunteer school's fifth-grade entrance exam starts with questions like "Describe the cause of electricity," "Briefly describe the major cities of our country," etc. This simply leads the children into a fog. Is this "spoon-feeding" education, where they ignore the children's interests and try to instill in them as much knowledge as they consider valuable, what we should have today? Should I make an appeal for the children: "Save the children!"</p>
<p>To be fair, the teachers are subjectively well-intentioned and excusable, but due to inappropriate measures, they are objectively almost harming the children. This is a point that we should not ignore and is worth mentioning again and again. The starting point of this article is based on this point, hoping that the teachers engaged in volunteer teaching today! Treat it as a mirror, "correct your faults if you have them, and strive harder if you don't." This is my sincere blessing.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Price of Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>— Dai Ying</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, plans regarding procurement, distribution, etc., have been decided one after another. If all plans can be implemented one by one, it seems that the price of rice can be stabilized in the coming year, and people's livelihood can naturally be less stable. However, in fact, today's livelihood issue is not only in terms of rice and grain, but also the exorbitant prices of other items, which have a greater impact on people's suffering than rice and grain. Among these, daily necessities and coarse grains are especially important, and the authorities are also planning to limit the prices and ration daily necessities, although the implementation period is not far off. However, there is no strict control over coarse grains. I believe this issue is also extremely important. Following rice and grain, it should be quickly controlled, and strict price limits should be set, otherwise the people's livelihood will still not be stable, and at most, the rice problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Among the coarse grains, special attention should be paid to soybeans, broad beans, red beans, and green beans. At present, the selling prices of beans all exceed the stipulated price limits for rice and grain. In this way, although the price of rice has been regulated and has fallen somewhat, various coarse grains are still being hoarded and overpriced by speculators, which is extremely unfair. Because in terms of bean prices, they were lower than rice prices in the past, but now the price of soybeans is actually twice that of rice. A picul of broad beans costs a thousand yuan, and red beans and green beans are all above a thousand yuan, which is an abnormal state. It seems that there is a need for adjustment. Otherwise, the impact on residents in rice-producing areas will be significant, and it seems too cheap for areas that grow coarse grains.</p>
<p>The exorbitant price of coarse grains has a greater impact on people's livelihood than rice. For example, the exorbitant price of soybeans makes it impossible to sell soybean oil, soybean cakes, tofu, soy sauce, and various soybean products at high prices. Under today's circumstances, ordinary families are unable to afford fish and meat, and even eating some tofu feels a bit unaffordable, not to mention that vegetarian dishes cannot do without soybean oil. Broad beans are also a staple food for the poor, and the new price of peanuts exceeds three thousand yuan per picul, which is even more expensive, making it impossible for people to buy. From this, it can be seen that the impact of coarse grains on people's livelihood is greater than that of rice, which is an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>Extending this to the excessively high prices of bran and soybean cake, which affect the rising prices of pork and meat, all have a close relationship with the people's livelihood. Therefore, strengthening the control of coarse grains and suppressing prices is also an urgent task. Otherwise, if the price of rice is low and the price of coarse grains only rises and does not fall, how can the people's livelihood problem be solved? Therefore, in the future, the prices of all items should be based on the price of rice, and those that were lower than the price of rice before the war should not be allowed to exceed the price of rice, and the price before the war should still be maintained. Otherwise, the people's livelihood problem cannot be solved. Although the price of rice is lower, the suffering and oppression of the people have not been reduced. Therefore, we are sincerely hoping that the selling price of coarse grains can also be quickly suppressed, and then extended to eggs and vegetables, so that they can all follow the price of rice and go down, so as to truly alleviate some of the people's suffering. May the authorities quickly take this into account.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Native Place Association: Charity Performance to Help Compatriots in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to successive letters from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Native Place Association in Hong Kong, due to the financial difficulties of refugees from Central and Northern China in the local area who wish to return home but have been unable to do so, remittances have been sent to help them in the past. However, a cup of water is difficult to achieve universal benefit, and thinking of the hometown friendship, how can we bear to sit idly by? Therefore, fellow countrymen gathered to discuss again, and a joint charity performance by famous opera stars and actors will be held at the New Stage on the evening of October 26. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be remitted to Hong Kong in full to help impoverished overseas Chinese to return to their hometowns early. It is hoped that those who love good deeds will contribute to the success of this event and benefit the refugees, so as to comfort themselves. The fellow countrymen are deeply gratified. Initiators: Cai Shengbai, Xu Guanjun, Yan Huiqing, Lin Kanghou, Li Sijie, Wu Songbi, Chen Binhe, Wu Jimai, Zhi Zhibo, Xu Jingfu, Xiang Lianyuan, Mei Fufang, Yang Yao, Liu Jisheng, Zheng Hongyan, Mo Yunwei, Sun Keren, Long Wenqi, Gai Zhaobin, Jin Run, Lu Zhaoxing, Wu Qizhou, Ji Tianmin, Ruan Yang, Cai Renju jointly announced.</p>
<h3>Mother Xia's Birthday Celebration: Saving Money to Help Students</h3>
<p>Mr. Xia Shikui of Zhenjiang is always eager to help those in need, is generous and righteous, and is extremely filial to his parents. On November 14 (i.e., the seventh day of the tenth lunar month), the 70th birthday celebration for Mr. Xia's mother, Madam Gao, will be held. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai have initiated a public worship ceremony at the Jade Buddha Temple on that day. Mr. Jiao Fafa, a close friend of Mr. Xia, told the author that during the period, he will fast and chant sutras, respectfully following his mother's orders. In view of the difficult times, all extravagant expenses will be simplified, and the saved funds will be donated to the scholarship fund run by Shen Bao and the loan fund run by Xinwen Bao, so as to help poor students and benefit all relatives and friends.

<h3>Solicitation of Funds for Stone Inscriptions, Calligraphy, and Paintings for the Hongying Library</h3>
<p>To promote culture, enlighten the people, broaden the road of governance, assist education, and provide a path for scholars to learn and a way for the public to conduct research, this is why libraries are valued in modern times. Since the establishment of this library, twenty years have passed. Through diligent management, a basic scale has been achieved. The library houses more than 150,000 volumes of books, over 300,000 pieces of various indexes, and over 1.8 million pieces of historical materials. The number of readers is in the thousands every month. However, the funds have been reduced, and it is extremely difficult to maintain. Plans to enhance the library's facilities are often simplified due to limited resources. Therefore, it is deeply regrettable that the progress of the education cause is hampered by insufficient funds. Therefore, the idea of an exhibition of stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings was initiated, both to promote artistic brilliance and to raise funds to support the library's expenses. By continuing our efforts, we can overcome any difficulties. Through this exhibition, we can learn from both domestic and foreign works of art and expand our knowledge. We admire the contemporary artists and famous masters in the country, whose works compete with each other in their brushstrokes and whose landscapes are rich in creativity. They excel in painting and engraving, and their reputations soar. Furthermore, we also appeal to generous gentlemen and collectors to donate their treasured collections or part with their beloved works. We humbly request your generous donations. Libraries are public undertakings for the benefit of society, and they rely on the collective strength of all, regardless of distance. We hope that you will support us and join us in this righteous cause. This is truly a blessing with no end, and its merits are not limited to a specific time or place. Sincerely, Hongying Library.
