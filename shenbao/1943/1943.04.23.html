<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">請求市當局嚴厲禁賭 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>賭博是民間最流行的一種「惡習」，小之則廢時失業，造成個人的悲慘結局；大之則危害社會，辱及國體。就本市實際情形而觀，賭博塲所，賭客擁擠，一揮千萬金之事，視同平常。於是一切邪行惡事，由此而生。我們查考近來貪汚投機，行私舞弊，以至殺傷刦奪等等案件，幾乎大都與賭塲有關。如果有人願意細查報紙社會新聞與司法機關民刑案件的紀錄，則雖說賭博爲目前本市犯罪行爲的唯一製造所，也不爲過。至於一般社會及家庭以賭博爲消遣及應酬之工具，竟已視爲當然。如拒絕邀約，反被目爲不知人情。所以，精神，時間，金錢與正當業務之消耗於家常賭博者，如加統計，即本市一地，其數字之驚人，恐非賭博者夢想所及。</p>
<p>最近當局已因「賭風甚熾，荒廢職務，敗壞風俗，馴至紀綱廢弛，人格墮落，至堪痛恨」。而有「嚴厲查禁，如有故違，卽拿獲嚴辦，以儆效尤」的命令。（四月七日南京中央社電）。但是禁令當不能以南京一地爲限，而必須遍及全國各地，更不當以一時之命令爲足，而必須持之以恒，務求破除情面，澈底禁絕。我們以爲不僅以賭博爲營業的賭塲及其變相的所謂茶室舞廳之類，必須澈底查禁；就使一般所謂「公餘消遣性質」的家常賭博，也必須一體厲行查禁。同時，政府機關公務人員，首當以身作則，凡有犯賭博而經證實者，概以曠職論過，情節較重者即須革職。而各大廠商公司，尤須自動嚴厲防誡職員工役之賭博行爲，對於遲到早退者，特別加以注意。這不僅是防止貪汚舞弊的根本辦法，而且也是提高行政效率或增進生產力的第一步驟。從整個社會說，厲行禁賭，是改善風習，防止奸宄，實現戰時生活的第一步。從目前國策說，厲行禁賭，是推行節約，戒除奢侈，集中人力物力以實現「總力參戰」的前提。「勿以善小而不爲」，願當局以大刀闊斧的勇氣，推進肅淸賭博的工作。記得一年前，本市滬四區，賭博公開盛行，旋經滬西憲兵當局決心取締，該區賭塲，遂無立足餘地。足證禁賭一事，初非難題，要在當局之決心耳。同時，我們認爲滬西方面，既已禁絕賭塲，則南市方面，因何而尙可存在。其次，公共租界區域已無公開賭博塲所，而法租界區域則尙有存在，同樣在上海市範圍以內，實不應彼此異致，遑論戰時生活絕不應有此等勞神傷財的賭博現象了。</p>
<p>不過同時我們要認淸，賭博是民族落後與社會生活不健全的特徵。倘使這個根本原因不加以剷除，則雖雷厲風行的查禁，也僅能收效於一時。何况我國以積弱積貧，各地常有特殊情形，過去西南某省，公然以販賣鴉片爲一省預算收入的主要源泉，而今日若干地區，或以賭塲爲挹注某種費用的來源，或有若干人民，竟靠賭博維持生活，這種情形，固然是「飮酖止渴」的不正當現象，但我們也不應忽視。所以在厲行禁賭之時，須有充分的準備，尤其要顧到一批過去靠賭吃飯者，不致挺而走險，加以適當的敎化，俾務正業。積極方面，我們要動員文化敎育與新聞各界，推進新文化與戰時生活運動，提高國民文化，發展正當的娛樂。尤其是戲劇·電影，歌舞之大衆化，文化公園，俱樂部，圖書館之增設，及體育技術，運動競賽等之提倡，使一般人都能走向光明愉快的坦途，自動脫離賭博的鬼窟。</p>

<h3 id="c2">東條內閣的強化 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東條內閣，於二十一日實行更調閣員，這無疑是爲了爭取戰勝的準備工作，所以與其謂係改組內閣，或謂閣員調動，毌寗說是東條內閣的强化來得適切。這次實行强化內閣，當然有其相當的理由和原因存在，但是我們並不欲去探究所謂政界的內幕情形。</p>
<p>如果好事生端的去窮究這種消息與情報，就會弄出失去本質的事來。舊政黨出身的新入閣，誰會相信是政黨勢力的復活呢。起用山崎，大麻兩氏，使議會勢力的中心，翼政會柱石入閣，在於確立眞正的舉國一致態勢，我們對於這種强化內閣措置，要從正面接受容納，東條內閣得能做到適應戰局新階段的强有力勢態，這是應該欣喜的。</p>
<p>僑居異國人們所最關心的外相調動，我們不必去想前任谷外相的退休經緯，還是抱積極的態度來期待重光外相所展開的今後外交活動。大東亞省設立後，現在的外交活動圍範，似乎已被限制得很小，然而對於中立國的外交工作還是很多，尤其是對於蘇聯，外務省所負的外交任務，依然很大。新外相重光氏，富有外交官經騐，又曾出使過蘇聯，今任斯職，實爲良材得其所用。而且他更深知中國情形，能和同在中國駐節過的靑木大東亞相並肩理事，東條內閣的對華政策，當然廣大，對於大東亞共榮圈的政策，定能極圓滑而强力的推進無疑。</p>
<p>然而在閣員更動的塲合，論些新閣員的經歷，手腕，抱負等，沒有多大意義。我們認爲這次的調動是爲强化東條內閣所不能避免的事；更相信强化了內閣，整頓了政治上的舉國一致勢態，必多貢獻於大東亞戰爭的完成。一切都是從推進戰爭的必要而來，也就是歸趨一致的措施，所以內閣的改組，早有其必要，旣定國策非惟不因改組而有絲毫動搖，且因內閣之改組而更積極的推進，所以內閣强化這四個字，不用明言巳很明瞭。在政變或者內閣改組之際，每每有過份的內部觀察，意見紛紜，此種猜測，徒供敵方作反宣傳之資料，在戰時下的我們要愼而或一。（雲鸝：譯自四月二十二日大陸新報）</p>

<p>『各界同胞，各位同志，去年今日——四月二十二日，本軍鑒於抗戰之徒苦民衆，無補時艱，於是毅然決然，通電復員，在我最高領袖在主席領導之下，遵從「和平反共建國」之國策，與友邦日本緊密協力，爲復興中國解放東亞而奮鬥。賴友軍之傾力援助，與各界袍澤之熱心輔導，俾我全軍將士，知所感奮，竭其忠勇，以報國家，本人於此，殊足引爲欣慰。駒光如駛，瞬屆一週，當茲復員周年之今日舉行紀念之時，回顧旣往，展望將來，不能不有感於心，而爲我同胞同志告，幷藉以對我全軍將士致其勗勉。本人在通電復員之後，旣已申述抗戰之不可持續，故一年以來，本軍將士黽勉以行之者，一爲致力和運，一爲擁護參戰；此兩大任務與使命，在縱的方面，互相銜接，在橫的方面，幷行不悖；由抗戰到和平，進而參加大東亞戰爭，始終乃爲一貫之主張，我政府當局已屢屢昭示於吾人。本人認定目前救國之道，不外和戰兩途，和平絕望，惟有一戰，和平到來，則可捨戰而謀和平，戰亦亡，不戰亦亡，亦惟有一戰，以表現忠勇愛國之人格：戰則亡，和則存，而又窮兵黷武，延長戰禍，是無異於率獸食人，匪特民不堪命，且將斷送國家，蓋抗戰之目的，在求國家之生存獨立。果能以合於正義之和平而結束戰事，則國家之生存獨立可保無虞，故本軍應時勢之要求，察民心之向背，發而爲良心之主張，於去年今日毅然通電參加和平陣營，仍本過去教國之一貫精神，爲和平運動而努力。顧以和運前途荊棘正多，中共騷動於內，英美挑釁於外，皆足以破壞中國之和平，東亞之建設。友邦日本洞察國際情勢，滲透共黨之陰謀，與英美之野心，確認爲非亟謀防共無以根絕赤禍，非擊滅英美無以解放東亞，故不惜以最大之犧牲，一面決心防共，以遏止唯物赤化之蔓延；一面邁進聖戰，以排除英美侵略主義者於東亞之外。我國民政府還都以來，亦本此共同之目標，爲共同之奮鬥。旣决定和運大計於前，復宣佈參戰方針於後，幷昭示同甘共苦，同生共死之旨，與友邦協力，匡濟時艱，用宏建國興亞之事功。本人忝總師干，責在衛國，祇知服從上峯命令，實事求是，埋頭苦幹，不托空言，不尙炫飾，爰就九之所能及者，惟慎惟勤。以實踐之故，復員以來，卽以剿除共匪，撫輯流亡，鞏固後方治安爲急務，藉以策應大東亞戰爭之進展，俾全面和平，早日　現。我全體將士首宜了解和運與參戰之眞實意義，並堅定其信念，　中其意志。務求紀律之　　　飭，陣容之刷新，齊一步伐，忍耐勞苦，一道同風，共赴事機。存民胞物與之心，愛獲百姓，具扶危定傾之力，保衛國家，此本人於復員周年紀念之日，對我全軍將士懇切勗勉者也。中國之全面和平東亞之最後勝利，即在目的，相信不久之將來，吾人當歡欣鼓舞，共唱凱旋之歌，願我同胞同志盡其最善之努力，是又不勝馨香禱祝者矣。」</p>

<p>（問）貴國一行來華使命若何？</p>
<p>（答）滿洲國爲加强中日滿東亞軸心間有無相通畏短相補之經濟實效，及考察新興中國政治設施，歸作本國施政參考而來華。同時因國與國間之團結緊密，胥繫於雙方之瞭解，多一番訪問，即多一番認識，此爲敝團來華之第二目的，中國因一經變亂，浦年災荒，農產欠收，吾人本於各憂其國，互愛其鄰，共愛東亞之初衷，實有加以補助之必要。本月初旬，中國特使周佛海先生訪滿，深信中滿國交，今後將益趨緊密，兩國經濟，更有裨益，敝團來華，亦耶爲考察盟邦中國之所需者，以作爲歸國後從事各地增產之準繩，此爲來華第三目的。</p>
<p>（問）貴國物資配給圓滑係何原因？</p>
<p>（答）物資配給首先調查當地所存物資，按戶造册，平均分配。至於抑平物價之先決條件，亦不外首先調查現存商品數量，尤其是嚴禁私自囤積，限制奸商自由搬運，釐定物價，各物不致上漲。更應節的消費，提高奢侈商品稅率，使其喪失購買力，歸於自然節約。一方面政府當局獎勵生產，對農民施行低率借貸，年增量達於旣定標準者，即有享受配給多量日用品之特權。政府年年提高標準，而生產率亦頻頻上增，物價低抑，供過於求，於是物資配給，得以圓滑推進。</p>
<p>（問）來京考察後有何感想？</p>
<p>（答）中華民國還都三年來，一切政治經濟文化等設施，在在突飛猛晋，一般國民，均能舉行新國民運動，精誠團結，前途光明，實爲可期。</p>

<p>柏林二十日中央社電</p>
<p>日本內閣改組消息傳出後，此間各界均一致表示歡迎。消息靈通方面對此之見解如次：（一）此次日內閣之改組，純因內政關係，日本國策絕不因此而有改變。（二）此次日政府起用政黨有力人士及外交界耆宿，足見東條首相　集結日本一億國民之總力，確立決戰體制，以爭取最後勝利之決意。（三）重光外相係日本第一流外交官，其外交手腕素爲歐洲外交界所欽佩，故在重光氏就任外相及天羽氏就任情報局總裁後，日本政府之外交陣容及宣傳陣容，必更　强化云。又德官方新聞社外交特派員霍恩博士　，德國政界對於星期二晚日本內閣之改組，印象極佳，並謂新外相重光葵必能在大東亞加緊日本之政策，該特派員指出重光屢遊德國，故在德亦頗有名望，德外交部認爲渠乃日本最能幹之外交家之一云，霍氏又譽揚重光對於促進中日關係之成就，並　重光任駐英大使時，對於日本對軸心國之態度，從未留有可疑之處云。</p>
<p>英保持緘默</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據路透社倫敦　稱，英政府對日內閣此次改組事，保持緘默，官方亦不加批評。惟消息靈通方面以重光氏會任駐英大使後經調駐華大使，故對氏出任外相頗爲重視，認爲日束條首相顯欲在外交上，加强中日兩國之關係，對內則謀外務省與大東亞省之協調云。</p>

<p>日名作家武者小路實篤氏，最近曾以日本文化界代表資格，前赴南京出席中日文化協會第二屆大會，並與中國文化界人士聯誼交　。此次返國以後，特就世界美術史之觀點，撰文指出東方精神文化之美點。大意如次：（一）余所認爲東亞之使命，在文明上歐洲曾有一時較亞洲爲進步，此點確爲事實。又吾人由彼等處所學得者爲數頗多，此點亦爲事實。就目下而言，關於物質文明，彼等（尤其爲英美）勝於吾人者更爲事實。然彼等自鳴得意輕視吾人，並自認具有支配亞洲之資格。且因彼等自認爲世界之支配者，歧視有色人種，彼等復認爲支配亞洲，乃在世界文化上所必要者，因此彼等在支配亞洲時，並不認爲此乃不道德之行爲，反認爲此乃拯救亞洲。同時彼等驕傲自大之態度，實已陷於不可自救之境，致彼等爲生活文化而利用亞洲所有之富源，當爲勢所必至。即以英國對印度之態度而觀，不僅極爲明顯，且充分表現其野心，故彼等必認亞洲與印度無異，然彼等終爲其驕傲自大之態度而遭失敗，至此亞洲文化始再逢光輝之時，而東亞之使命亦即在此。西歐方面如德義等國巳充分確認東亞之使命，並認助長亞洲文化，乃在其本身之文化上所必要者。但英美等國迄今仍未對東亞之使命有所感覺，猶認亞洲爲其食餌，視日本爲眼中之釘，在各方面進行妨資日本之工作。日本在忍無可忍之下，遂毅然而起，全世界最愛好和平之日本天皇陛下，遂頒發向英美宣傳之大韶，吾人對此聖心實爲感泣，此即有大東亞戰爭之使命。同時此使命與全人類所希望者完全一致，英美遂相繼返還其應返還之各地，然彼等不但仍未覺悟，其戰敗乃被眞理所征服，更未停止其支配亞洲之野心執迷不悟，猶竭盡全力圖再滿足其慾　，而枉費極大犧牲。。實際上此次戰爭中最爲愚蠢者莫如美國，除美國外，其他各國均爲不得已而戰。其中亦有如英國者，其慾望實過深·無論如何亦決不再放棄，致不得不戰，故美國亦謂彼之加入戰爭，乃出於不得已，唯美國若不作戰亦無不可，因美國若不參加戰爭，當必決爲世界上有利之國家，不僅國家日益富強，即其國民亦得安居樂業。然彼等竟欲捲入戰禍，作無謂之犧牲，而多數國家之國民更抱唯有美國始能拯救世界之錯覺，因此美國此舉實屬愚蠢萬分，然此亦無非因其驕傲自大而受之天罰而巳·（二）彼等之理念及其文化，終乃臨於末路·吾人可以認爲新生巳在世界上苦鬥之中，此不久即產生之新生物，其最大者即爲東亞之復　　興，同時不久即將成爲亞洲之復興。實際上中日兩國完全能一致協力之時，即爲亞洲巳宜吿獲得勝利之時。世界現正期望有此一日，因此日本遂毅然而起，事實上目下正爲戰事之中途，東亞之興亡，能在今日決定。余等痛感此次戰爭之重大，然對最後之勝利，絲毫無不安之念，在此次戰爭中，眞理屢在吾人之旁，吾人更深信此乃人類所希望，而東亞之使命乃首在由英美手中解放東亞。其意即在使世界之人類認識負有各得其所，創造本身文化之使命，因世界上決不致有自認，惟被輕視而亦無妨之人種，吾人以被輕視人種之資格，首警吿英美輕視人種之不合理，促其反省。彼等之物質文明較吾人爲進步，固屬事實，然此次非人種質之優秀，吾人僅爲種種關係，對採取世界之文化稍遲而已。然吾人並不看輕彼等優秀之處實甚多世上唯有以美術最能言一國之國民性，一見美術即能知其正體，世界各國之圖畫中，最能表現其驕傲自大之性格者即爲英國。又世界上多數肖像書中，最無內容目充滿驕傲自大性格之肖像聳亦爲英國。至於美國之畫最爲可憐，其畫之性質並無在精神上具有優點者，然極淸淡，且使人感覺淺薄之畫，却爲彼等所最尊敬者，故彼等之畫，絕不能匹敵日本光琳之作，然日本較光琳之作品更優者，尙有百餘人之多。東亞方面尤以中國最多優秀之書像家，西洋方面僅在義法荷蘭等國有優秀之畫家。（三）彼等多不識東亞方面羅漢畫之深有趣味，輒謂其爲束亞人之醜惡，此實因彼等不能理解其精神上之深奧所致。同時彼等更毫無理解吾人樸實風雅之處，吾人見美國紐的之物質文明，實能使吾人一驚，然試問人類之價値，是否乃以物質而估計或以精神而估計？余以爲人類之價値，乃應以精神而估計。彼等所最尊重之基督會處於何種生活，未知彼等曾否眞加思索，吾人將使彼等理解彼等巳忘却之精神上淸凈喜悅，當然東卞人亦有未知者，然吾人應將自然之美，幽雅文化美點，喚醒彼等之頑迷，使彼等居其應居之處，而有滿足之感。同時再使彼等知世界上應互相尊敬，始能有愉怏，以上實爲吾東亞文化界人重大任務。至少西洋方面，在精神上已有進步之人士，恐巳感西洋文化巳到末路，並望東洋之本來文化，從世界中所得之滋味使其健全生長，而完成彼等之所深任，望吾人互相協力，以完成此偉大使命。</p>

<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　德國新聞社昨晚宜稱：星期二日英第八軍，曾屢次猛攻突尼西亞東北橋頭堡南郁之軸心軍陣地，皆被德義聯軍所擊退。柏林方面稱，目前戰事爲突尼西亞大戰之第四階段，係於星期一日晚間開始。英軍在恩斐達維爾區域進攻，歷二十四小時之久，仍毫無進展。英軍在第一晚進攻中，因中地雷損失慘重，後經若干小時之砲轟，又復二度進攻，亦無結果而退。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據此間二十一日所接消息：英第八軍自在突尼西亞戰綫東南都開始總攻擊後，迄今已逾三十六小時，但仍未衝破軸心軍之堅强陣地，至於作戰經過，英軍初於十九日夜首以前驅砲火猛轟恩斐達維爾附近一帶軸心軍陣地，權即開始新攻勢。其進攻之範圍，闊達二十公里以上，終因觸及軸心軍所埋地雷，致死傷慘重，至此英軍第一日之進攻，乃遭失敗。翌日英軍復開始攻擊，雖曾衝破軸心軍陣地數處，但經軸心軍猛攻後，絡奪回各處陣地。。現因軸心軍所設陣地地形，不適於坦克車之大規模作戰，尤以西部防綫，殆悉爲山嶺地帶，故反軸心軍遂在恩斐達維爾地形上較爲平坦之處開始攻勢·總之，反軸心軍因不能由側面擊軸心軍陣地，故不得不由正而突擊，惟反軸心軍在正面之攻勢作戰，必難有迅速之進展。</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　突尼西亞大戰之第四回合，似已開始。英第八軍經數小時之猛烈砲火準備後，即於四月廿日晚間以精强之部隊，向德義軍陣地之南面側翼攻擊，劇戰仍在進行中。據此間昨日宣稱：至目前爲止，反軸心軍之各次大攻擊，皆遭擊退。反軸心軍僅在數處據點，進入軸心陣地，但皆瞬即被擊退。突境南部戰綫中當戰鬥之衝者，爲海岸附近之恩斐達維爾地區。此處地區之蒙特高茂萊將軍，所部英軍，曾集合大量部隊，企圖突破義軍所主守之陣綫。目前敵軍在此處地區之冀圖，尙未能認爲成功，攻擊之英軍，已被擊退。義軍並反攻奪回暫時失去之土地，各處據點之義軍，幾皆能將敵軍軀退，至原來陣綫。交戰地區之地勢，對於巨型坦克車之活動，有極大之困難。德國方面宣稱：戰綫之中段及西段之德義軍，佔守高地，不易受坦克車部隊之攻擊，僅在南面惻翼方面，尤其是在恩斐達維爾地區，地勢較爲平坦，可以運用較大之軍隊。但柏林方面之軍事專家意見，以爲在突尼西亞之現時戰綫中，實不能作包抄之冀圖，英美軍僅能試圖從廣闊之陣綫突破。柏林方面對於此處地區之局勢，仍抱樂觀。</p>

<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德方軍事發言人昨晚談稱：突尼西亞戰事，現已成爲包圍堡壘戰。英將蒙特高茂萊所部之第八軍配備齊全，對於沙漠戰事所　之一切，可稱無一不備。但在目前進行之戰事中，此項配備之大部已成爲無用，因在恩斐達維爾區域內，祇餘海岸上之小部狹長地帶適於大批坦克車作戰。突尼西亞前綫之其他部份，叢山林立，如欲大舉進攻，必須使用其他方法，是以德軍事專家咸信反轉心軍在此新階段之戰事中，將遭遇不易解決之困難。德義軍在山岳地帶之陣地成一半圓形，圍繞突尼斯與比塞大之主要據點。柏林方面稱之爲軸心國在北非之主要戰綫。日前爭奪馬萊斯陣綫之戰事，與目前開始之戰事相比較，可稱之爲前哨陣地之爭奪戰。此間認爲英美軍之第一次攻勢已吿失敗，英國雖有數處突入對方陣綫，但不能加以利用，一經德義軍反攻即行退走，故全綫現仍在德義軍固守之中，毫未動搖云。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　反軸心國報紙昨晚莫斯科消息，謂德國之山戰隊以部工程部隊及黑衫衛隊之槍手協助，向庫彭河口三角洲蘇軍所守之山嶺陣地猛攻。德官方新聞社則謂，德軍及羅軍之山戰部隊，於星期二作猛烈攻擊，已擴展其在諾伏洛西斯克附近之高地地。柏那消息稱，德羅聯軍與德空軍密切合作，衝擊蘇方之哨岡陣地，並抗拒蘇軍之反攻。莫斯科方面稱，德軍在庫彭河口三角洲進攻，已遭蘇軍擊退。雙方正在劇戰時皆有重大損害。莫斯科方面已證實諾伏洛西斯克地區有活躍之戰鬥，攻擊與反攻相繼不斷，蘇聯黑海艦隊以部隊在諾伏洛西斯克之西登陸再事攻擊，但莫斯科方面承認諾伏洛西斯克本身並未受嚴重威脅，因德軍之堅固防地，阻斷通至海港之道路。據駐莫斯科之反軸心記者稱，蘇軍繼續不斷轟擊德軍陣地，希冀結果得征服德軍之抵抗，彼等以爲德軍甚難輸送軍火給該地區之部隊，東綫其他地區，昨晚未聞有重要發展。</p>

<p>（柏林十五日專電）德義軸心軍在突尼西亞東北之一角，似欲死守非洲唯一陣地，北非戰局之歸趨，軸心與協約雙方陣營，各具用心，其秘藏之計劃，實爲左右次期大戰之前提條件。朝日新聞柏林分社于十五日與里斯本分社通一國際長途電話，詢問突尼西亞之情勢，茲誌問答如下。</p>
<p>柏林守山特派員（問）突尼西亞之情勢，就柏林方面觀察，因視綫之位置不良，故戰局中心何在，不能十分淸晰，你所居者爲中立國，雙方的情報都能獲得，請就現在情形，吿訴一些。</p>
<p>里斯本茂木特派員（答）英國的報紙遲一天才能看到，所以敵方的意向如何，祗能略見大體，不過眞正情形如何，也不明瞭。即使有些似乎十分明白的人，實際也是一知半解的虛言，此間集大衆關心者，即爲羅美爾，亞尼摩兩軍合流後是否能作死守突尼斯，比塞大的戰鬬，德義兩軍的決心，究在那裏？</p>
<p>（問）這個問題，在最近希墨會談上經過愼重討論，已經是一個決定的問題了。內容如何，當然不會向普天下去吿訴，德國軍也沒有這樣笨的，像這種機要的內容，敵方唯恐知之不詳，德軍怎會宣佈呢？</p>
<p>（答）此間軸心官方認爲突尼西，比塞大必然死守，只要看了蘇軍至死不讓史太林城的鹼例，就能想見此情。試觀蘇聯少數部隊在伏爾加的後方運輸斷絕之後，還是死守史太林城的市內一角，那末北非的戰局，縱使和西西里鳥的交通中斷，要是堅守突尼斯，比塞大要塞，未嘗不能作長期戰。</p>
<p>（問）德國方面現在抱有極大希望，以比塞大，突尼斯要塞爲中心，靠近旁的山岳地帶立陣，利用足以防禦的天然地勢，形成堅固的龜甲陳地，反之敵方因爲推進戰綫二千五百公里後，急需整理後方兵站綫，如欲總攻此龜甲陣地，更須整頓軍隊，結果突尼西亞的軸心軍，願在其中找一個機會不失時機的發動，這是德國的希望，也是一般德人的見解。</p>
<p>（答）看了羅美爾軍的動向，就覺得『時』這句話是最切當的。今年一月裏，英國老是說突尼西亞戰局，三月底一定可使其結束，至少蘇軍的攻勢不衰，就要在歐洲開始登陸作戰，可是這種主張，已經因爲協約軍主力，被羅美爾軍引到北非去而不能實現，假使庫爾斯克，卡科夫被蘇軍克復，當時的北非戰局像現在這樣緊張，那末軸心軍難免要遭重大危機，現在因爲東戰塲吿一段落，所以軸心軍不會招受兩處正面作戰的不利，德國國民對此北非戰局到底作何感想呢？</p>
<p>（問）此間德人，都能不慌不忙的鎭靜，像第六集團軍在史太林城重圍時的那種深刻而悲痛的表情，一些也看不出，這是有種種原因在內：第一戰局還沒有到史太林城那樣的嚴重，一般民衆都相信羅美雨將軍，因爲維氏出奇制勝的名將，所以羅氏的縮小戰綫準備出寄進攻戰略，深爲大衆信賴。第二，從埃及撤退到利比亞，突尼西亞，前前後後的情形，沒有絲毫隱瞞國民的地方，所以德國國民處之泰然，深明成敗爲兵家之常的戰爭原理。當初史太林之役的德人驚駭，因爲了前德國當局不言眞相，把事實隱瞞了二個月，直到大勢已去才發表驚人的眞相，所以國民要沉痛失色，可是北非戰局，情形懸殊，就沒有這種駭異現象了。</p>
<p>（答）據最近的情報稱：自本月十日至十一日，有英美護航船團通過直布羅陀駛入地中海，這個船團，恐怕小是開往突尼西亞戰綫，而是和待機於阿爾及利亞的第二戰綫所用的部隊去合流的，預先準備着次期作戰。</p>
<p>總而言之，突尼西亞戰綫，是促進歐洲戰爭的導錢，切不可大意忽視。</p>

<h3 id="c36">德意兩巨頭會談意義 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>（羅馬十二日山崎特派員發）道次希特勒和墨索里尼的會談，是前次墨索里尼和里賓特洛甫在羅馬會談的歸結，並且是繼那决會談之後，寳尼資提督的訪意，墨索里尼和加拉伊——意匈兩首相的會談，希特勒和保加利亞國王波里斯的會談等，一連串的軸心方面巨頭會談的總決算；然而其對外的，則爲對於英美的歐洲戰後經營計劃回答。即此次會談，是以如次二個問題爲主體的：</p>
<p>第一，由歐洲新秩序的再建和再編組，把歐洲形成團結一致之强有力的協同體，使成爲戰爭遂行和戰後經營的基礎；</p>
<p>第二，更以今年爲歐洲大戰達到決定的階段之先見，在軍事的，政治的，外交的一切分野，集中最後的努力，造成最有利的新情勢。</p>
<p>上述第一個問題，是前次墨索里尼和里賓特洛甫會談中未吿解決要留下去的問題。此次會談，以意方之眞正的坦白的意見爲基礎，德意之更密切的合作，和以兩者爲領袖的旗下諸國的協力，可說已見實現。這裏關於：</p>
<p>（一）兩者和全歐諸國間的諸懸案的解決，以及根據何等形式的保障的考慮；</p>
<p>（二）解決外鍚爾伐尼亞（Tansydvania）問題的努力租匈牙利對於現行戰爭之積極的參加；</p>
<p>（三）保加利亞對同盟諸國協力的強化；</p>
<p>等，會特別加以商談。總之，由墨索里尼首相先前所提出的：</p>
<p>「歐洲諸國和亞洲諸國，性質雖完全不同，然而日本所採取着的關於建設新東亞的態度，吾人大有可學之處」。</p>
<p>從這主張以觀，則上述的新編維，當必是循着和東亞新秩序的理念及形式相等的方針而施行的，不難想像而得。</p>
<p>至於第二個問題，則不妨視爲是以第一個問題爲前提而出發，而且富於變化性的。即關於：</p>
<p>（一）法國的治安維持，沿岸防備，（二）希臘的防備；（三）保加利亞的沿岸防備等之防禦的性質者，以及（四）東部戰綫今夏的攻勢：突尼西亞戰綫的今後，（六）因着保加利亞之積極的協力而生之土耳其方面的情勢變化。</p>
<p>等等，在目前的情勢下應加處理之一切軍事的政治的措施，可認爲一律被加以檢討過的。英美方面把兩巨頭的會談，宣傳爲關於如何防禦英美之侵入歐洲者，然而該會談原是預定於突尼西亞戰綫情勢變化以前舉行的，不過偶然因着情勢的變化，遂使墨索里尼首相的出發延期而已。單由一地方的戰况之若干變化，不能決定會談，爲意國朝野所得保障，故本會談的目的，在於歐洲內部根本問題之徹底的解決，和以此爲基礎之將來的發展。因此，本會談決不楚何等消極的防術的會談，而是對於將來之建設的積極的會談，它的成果，縱令不是怎樣華美的，而在歐洲新秩序和戰爭遂打上，則無疑是極雄辯地表現出它的性格的。（丁：譯自四月十四日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>日本在上海陸軍部報道部發言人，於昨日下午三時，在招待本市新聞記者團常會席上，對英美軍事評論家最近評論日美戰爭，發表感想：</p>
<p>地勢不利　首述美國一般人民，迭　美政府之造謠報道，故對日美戰爭詳情不明，今有美評論家，以準確之判斷，就美政府發表戰况，加以詳細分析批評。日發言人首引美評論家之地勢說明，謂目前對日進攻之途凡三：（一）利用在渝之大陸，如以地理上言，中國對日交接雖近，但於軍事形勢上無裨實際，加之交通不便，困難重重，縱能以飛機運輸，其飛機數量，人力及材料汽油等不够分配，故絕難達到理想之幻夢。（二）利用澳洲作根據地，然澳與美之距離遙遠，自洛杉磯至澳，中間行程需一萬二千海哩，即以運輸船輸送，但船舶困難，並須中徐添油，即使能如願以償抵達澳洲，向北進攻日本國土，其間又隔南洋，况所羅門島附近之大小島嶼，悉操在日本掌握，斷無進攻力量，故美評論家之評言，如須進攻日本國土，非運用海陸軍力，將大小各島嶼攻克不可。（三）再如由阿村斯加至阿留申羣島，其中間距離，是否有餘力補充，尙屬疑問，加之路程遼闊，運輸困難，故殊難得逞。</p>
<p>資源困難　日軍自開始大東亞戰爭後，早將熱帶寒帶，溫帶名地予以佔領，且各地資源豐富，不但日本予以完全利用，同時並積極從事生產，資源盡入日手，故美如圖對日反攻，須將每一軍力充分補充，今在補充上巳感棘手。再以軍力言，美之有意作持久戰，竟有計劃陸軍至明年增加至八百五十萬人，否則達反攻目的，今姑不論，由美遣軍至新西蘭地，在事實佔計其布置，須動員一千另五十萬人，是以如此龐大軍力，更難如願。故美軍事評論家對美政府之向日反攻，特別提出地勢·資源·兵力動員三大問題，在渠之結論上已昭然透示難成事實，尤以兵力雖能訓練動員，此龐大數量，何時可吿完成，我人在觀測美目前之軍力，已可窺見一斑。</p>

<h3 id="c54">保富法應用的商榷　（一） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>聶雲台老居士所作保富法，博大精深，圓融極致，洵是嘔心之文。近復撰「先樂山公醫藥濟人之報」，尤爲砭世良言，日昨在靜安寺恭聆張一鸝先生講演「市民福利」，所見相同，極爲感動·乃不揣冒昧，引申其義，幸閱者諸君有以敎之。　楊郁生</p>
<p>何謂富？富爲豐厚有餘之謂。昔嚴復譯述「原富」一書，係引演西哲經濟學理而非指一身一家之富，而各國學者對於富的解釋，亦不一致，常人只指有形之富，不知「富有才學」「富有同情」更爲重要。財富的觀念，是個人心理與社會心理所造成。不論倫理的，宗敎的，經濟的，美術的一切，因需求和供給的變動，每每決定其價値，在社會平衡的估計上，獲得其數量。金銀錢鈔，不過爲計算上之籌碼而已。貧富乃比較上的名稱，在富有之邦，衣食足亦不得謂官，如吾國頻年戰禍，民不聯生，正是國父所謂「祇有大貧小貧」，即號爲富者亦未必眞富也。</p>
<p>何者爲富之標準？人人有利己之心，富貴觀念，牢不可破，以爲不做官，不投機，無以致富，不富無以爲榮，不榮無以生勢，此庸俗之槪見。試問何者爲富之標準？當此生活奇艱，富之標準亦最難定：（一）以錢鈔爲標準乎？錢鈔爲通貨，其價値常在變動之中。</p>
<p>（二）以貨物爲標準乎？値此物資缺少，囤積居奇，固可立致鉅富，然爲國家法令所不許，况漫藏誨盜，古人所戒，即使隱藏而保持其富有，不知勤勉生產，則坐吃山空，亦不可恃也。</p>
<p>（三）以身家性命爲標準乎？世俗之人，但認血肉之軀，以爲我身，妻妾兒女，以爲我眷，金玉珠寶，以爲我富，貪痴妄念，以爲我心，將此身心作標準而作千秋萬歲之計，遂以之造種種這業，忙忙碌碌，煩煩惱惱，無非是苦，不知血肉之軀爲有形之物，變化無定也，妻妾兒女爲身外之眷，聚散無當也，金玉珠寶稀世之珍，別人可攘奪也，貪痴妄念爲無明之性，更不可捉摸也。合而言之，生滅無常，如依生理學或解剖學以觀察肉體，分析至於極，則知肉體非眞我，依　會學以觀察眷屬，則知個體各自存，依心理學以觀察精神，則感覺及情緒皆不外乎刺激反應等諸作用，一切的一切，亦我不着眞正財富之標準。</p>
<p>誰是富？富如何可保？古今來多少富翁，在生前雖赫赫一時，而食唯三餐，睡僅一榻，亦無幸福可言，石崇之富，以奴輩利其家財，不得善終，象以齒焚，豹以文戳，匹夫無罪，懷璧其罪，處亂世以財富召禍患者，何可勝道乎？故老子云：「金玉滿堂，莫之能守，富貴而務，自遺其咎，持而盈之，不如其已。」古人以勤儉致富者尙與能守。如盜竊而來，更奢　相尙，其破敗更速，憶馬蔭良先生在申報上談到人生問題，說：「保富不如不富，富羣方能富己」·確是合乎科學理名的至言。</p>
<h3 id="c55">經濟界　評　物價問題中的度量衡 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>工部局警務處度量衡調查科，爲取締商人使用不合標準的度量衡器起見，近特派員分赴本市各區，嚴密調查，如發現有使用不合標準之度量衡器者，決照下列辦法　處：（一）按照刑法控訴法院，（二）依據地皮章程附則，予以傅詢，（三）分別予以警吿，（四）沒收其不合標準之度量衡器。而據日前工部局情報處的公吿，新閘菜場第四十五號肉攤攤販孫與財使用短秤，判處罰金三百元，秤具沒牧。而昨日市府且接收事變前本市度量衡檢定所的鎊秤等儀器，以備應用。</p>
<p>考諸古代歷史：。「希伯來及印度，皆有懲罰偽造度量衡之法規，並視偽造度量衡者，與增高市價以罔利者同罪·」遇見偽造與使用不合標準之度量衡，同爲抬高物價的犯罪行爲。</p>
<p>我國的度量衡器，在民國十八年間，政府當局因其弊端百出，會制定度量衡條例，以公尺，公斤，公升爲單位；同時並以市尺，市斤，市斗爲並行單位。同年，並曾舉行使用標準度量衡宣傳運動。我們認爲不合標準的度量衡，亟應澈底進行取締；對於度量衡器之製造，應予以嚴厲的監督，對於商民使用不合標準之度量衡器，更應予以嚴厲的懲罰，務使我們老百姓從物價高漲中所受到的壓迫，不至處處加重。</p>

<p>國府參戰後鑒於戰時下糧食之重要性，特改組親委會爲糧食部，專掌全國糧食生產管理及配給事宜。該部自成立後，對於糧食行政頗多壁劉。中央社記者，特於日昨往訪該部周次長叩詢關於（一）戰事下糧食問題的根本對策？（二）生產統制分配消費的概况，承爲二作答，內容極爲詳盡，茲誌大要如下：</p>
<p>一·戰時下糧食問題的根本對策有三：（甲）爲增加生產以求收獲豐富，充實倉儲，（乙）爲強化統制，以期供求相應，價格平衡，（丙）爲管理消費，以求配給合理，享受平均，三者同時並進，不容偏蔽，二·至於</p>
<p>增加生產　之計劃，先從糧食中最關軍需民食之重要物資，如（一）農產品（二）水產品（三）畜產品，用試騐推廣繁殖保護貸款種種手段，使其產量增加，技術改進。三·一切糧食物資，各省市均應由經營糧食商人，組織</p>
<p>同業公會　每一個同業公會，組織可分四組，（一）採辦商組（二）販賣商組（三）零售商組（四）製造商組，如此組織則分工合作，收效較宏，現歸糧食部主管之糧食業同業公會，其種類列舉如左：一雜糧業，二麵粉業，三牲畜業，四水產業，五蛋業，六食用油業，七糖業，八茶葉業，九罐頭食品業，十釀造業，十一調味業，十二蔬菜果實業，十三其他日常生活習慣上所公總之飮食物品業，糧食部就前項各業所營之糧食物資中，業經呈准行政院指定主要商品六種如下：（一）雜糧（二）麵粉（三）牲畜（四）雞蛋（五）糖（六）食用油，其細目不日日即可公布，至於</p>
<p>米榖性質　異常重要向歸政府直接管理，在未經頒布工商同業公曾條例以前，先已訂定米糧聯營社組織章程，飭由各統一徵購米穀區域內縣市米商着手組織聯營社，所有米商一律加入，其不參加聯營社者，不得經營米業，一切組織內容及精神與其他糧食業同業公會完全相同，其不同之點，（一）米榖聯警社無庸參加上海絲制總會，其他糧食主要商品同業公會，必須參加統制總會，（二）米穀聯營社所用證照，由糧食部核發，其他糧食主要商品同業公會得自行塡發搬運許可證明書。四至於</p>
<p>管理消費　辦法，其量爲澈底者，惟有舉辦針口授糧，俾人人有糧，糧有定量，母多國，毌浪費，凡屬消耗米糧之營業，如釀酒，如製點，均宜加以取締，總之在今日戰時下，糧食部惟一之使命，爲增加生產，强化管理，以期充實軍需，安定民食，上下一心一德，羣策羣力，糧食問題庶有解決之望。</p>

<h3 id="c62">讀者論壇　解決物價問題的澈底辦法　（一） <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 繆仲徽</p>
<p>上海的「物價問題」已成全國的經濟問題。戰後內地工廠大半停工，一切日用物資都須仰仗上海輸出，因此上海物價的升漲，直接影響全國的物價。物價高漲，等於紙幣無形貶値。人民將身邊所有貨幣拋出，換成有用的物品，這是顯露，對於通貨的不信任。由於整個社會搜求物資的結果，更造成物價的再騰貴。民衆對於物價的恐慌心理，可使幣制崩潰，國民經濟破產。這種物價騰貴的惡性循環，具有三種因素。其一，是物資缺乏的影響；其二，通貨膨脹的結果。其三，操縱市塲與役機圃積的形成。</p>
<p>以物資缺之爲其原因不一定是對的，因爲戰時的物資當然不能像和平時的豐富，物價騰貴是免不了的現象。但是出於這種原因而高漲，其高漲是緩升的形式，因爲是由於物資存底的消耗而漸進。現任上海物價的在躍形態，絕不是物資缺乏一個簡單原因所能包括它。若以通貨膨脹爲引起物價高漲的原因，那末也應當是節進的，不是激急的，突躣的，况且，和乎區面積增大，稅收增加，中儲券的流通面積，正仕擴大中，決不能認爲是引起物價高漲的主凶。所以，投機囤積實乃是最大的主因。</p>
<p>撲滅囤戶，政府已有決心，非民衆翹首企，就是友邦亦加重視。但是，現在　洽不能完全脫離舊習，是不　否認的事實。目前所謂「大　虎」的背景，引起社會上議論紛紛，言之鑿鑿。政府爲整個民族生存着想，急當運用絕大的政治力量，不惜最大的犧牲，澈底調查，以維民族的生存，民衆對於四月七日國府頒佈的「澈查投機令」，大都認爲「官樣文章」。爲消滅這樣一種民衆觀念，政府應當急速頒佈「臨時緊急取締投機囤積　治條例」。不妨以擾亂國家罪起訢，而由軍事法庭執行。現在以鄙見所及，擬爲三種辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）澈底淸查投機囤積：其一，以前金融界的濫放款，或以貨物爲押款，其所得的結果，實足以造成通貨膨脹的現象，因以此軟囤貨，史足刺激物價上漲·最近二三年滬上銀行的設立，有如雨後春筍，查其前身，多爲小型錢莊，而其業務僅爲投機，或不正當的放款。如查明有這種銀行的存在，應即予以查封，其經營人則按照罪行大小，嚴加處分。</p>
<p>（二）其二，凍結倉庫，亦爲最有效的辦法。對於任何倉庫中的貨品，一律不許搬出搬進，迅速調查貨主存貨之目的，如有囤積嫌疑，應予拘捕，貨物充公。其三，淸查商店。商店拒絕賣出，是年來的怪現象，全市大小商店的囤積，亦是構成高物價的原因，且道接刺激民衆的恐慌心埋。是當責成商統會一類機關，辦理凋查存貨，而商店有無拒絕出售貨物情事，叫任民衆秘密舉發。遇有上述情形，除商店封閉外，店主，保人，公會負責人均應一律解交法院，從嚴處分。其四，責成分區保甲長限期調查舉報轄區內的囤戶。若遇有租屋囤積，或營投機事業者，一律法辦，保甲長隱匿不報者，罪應反坐。其五，獎勵民衆自山秘密舉發。其六，組織密查隊，抽查商店好人民票發的囤戶。——以上六個淸查辦法的實行，尙須研究其步驟和詳細辦法。總之，不應溢出政治手段爲原則。</p>

<h3 id="c63">人生三喻 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 張心</p>
<p>人生有三個比喻：</p>
<p>第一個比喻是海洋：海洋有風平浪靜的時候，也有驚濤駭浪的時候。在風平浪靜時，所謂海闊天空，風帆，遠山，沙鷗，點綴成一幅綺爛的海景。在驚濤駭浪時，却是天昏地黑，狂風，急雨，重霧，籠罩着整個宇宙。然而，必有驚濤駭浪？始知風平浪靜的難得。如果一直都風平浪靜，也許會使人看得厭膩，感到平凡和單調哩！同時，在浪濤洶湧的時候，海才會發出震動天地的怒吼，和激起活躍的銀白色的浪花，那才見得海的雄壯和偉大。</p>
<p>第二個比喻是江河：江河帶着淸潔的品質，長平不息地流着，冷靜地，沈着地，只有前進，沒有後退，山嶺阻不住牠，岩山抵不住牠，風也吹不轉牠，終於有一天，牠到達了目的地——海洋。</p>
<p>第三個比喻是池沼：池沼帶着陳舊的品質，永久的停滯着，偶然會被風雨所掀動的，也只是一層薄薄的浮面，牠的整體永不會推進一步，所以內裏只是渾濁和汚穢，微生物也乘　居留着，使牠發生腐臭。</p>
<p>第一種人生最有價値，第二種人生最有朝氣，第三種人生最沒出息。</p>
<h3 id="c64">利 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 莎蕾</p>
<p>世人熙熙，皆爲「利」來，世人攘攘，皆爲『利』往。</p>
<p>『利』之本身，本無善惡。合法『利』潤，且爲法律所規定，無有詬病之處。</p>
<p>但孟子開卷，便極言好『利』之弊已。『利』之所在，羣起如騖。見『利』忘義，何顧於信；求『利』負德，何視於仁，於是不義不信，無德無仁，虛偽，狡猾，爾詐吾虞，兩目所視，『利』也；兩耳所聞，『利』也；兩足所行，爲『利』也；兩手所動，爲『利』也；滿腦所想，無往而非『利』焉。居奇，囤積，壟斷，敲詐，剝削，造謠生事，播風作浪，但謀一己之『利』，那管十萬人之啼餓號寒！</p>
<p>古語有『銀白金黃，眼見心變黑』。現在的鈔票，却是五色繽紛，看了心旌神搖，一等『利』之慾薰心，而『利』也令智昏，於是乎不擇手段，遑論道義。</p>
<p>物慾之路不塞，如何開得道義之門？誠如柏拉圖所說：『物質的需要，乃是阻碍靈魂向上的孽障』，而始作祟者，醉心於『利』之募道中而迷失了方向。</p>
<h3 id="c65">真與假 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 夢麟</p>
<p>一個矮子站在金宇塔的尖頂上，你會說他比金字塔更高嗎？不會的，別人還是要叫他矮子啊！但世界上獨多這種傻了。十個人要　逃　　藏目己的惡德是不可能的。因爲你背了太陽走，自己的陰影總在自己的面前，除非你面向太陽走，影子才會在你的後面。</p>
<p>所以不論爲人，爲事業，我們應「求其眞，不求其假，凡事實事求是。要知道我們日常的品格，思想，生活，………都已爲別人所洞悉。即使能遮蔽汚點於一時，但遲早總要顯露出來。當每個汚點進入我們的心坎時，便在我們的品格上留下深刻的痕跡，終一生也揩拭不掉。出賣耶穌的是他的門徒猶太，雖然起先全不知道，直等到他管理了一個三十元錢的錢袋時，立刻顯露他賣主的奸惡，後來他是吊死的，但也贖不了他的罪。</p>
<p>花特蘭說：「品格是一個人的內地，名譽是一個人的外貌」，道是絲毫不爽的，一個行結一個菓，絕對沒有假的存在，只有絕對的眞。</p>
<p>午禮拜堂中常有人口中敬虔地禱吿說：「即使以全世界的寳藏給我，我也不希罕，因爲我們有了一顆純潔的心，便是最偉大的財產了」。但是當他們在捐獻時，却在摸索着價値最低的鈔票，………還用抵賴嗎？眞與假便立刻顯明了。</p>
<p>是「眞」是「假」，旣騙不了別人，也騙不了自己。</p>
<h3 id="c66">生死觀 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 樂明</p>
<p>顧政書先生在靑年會演講「生與死的搏鬥」中之一段</p>
<p>凡是一個人，他總有一次生，也總有一次死。無論他怎樣愛生，他總不能長生；無論他怎樣怕死，他總不能免死。</p>
<p>有的人，生時震撼鄰里，死了卻沒沒無無聞。有的人，生時無人知覺，死了卻萬人崇敬。</p>
<p>一個人對於生與死的看法，可以決定他生活的態度和方式。此一人覺得人生不過數十寒暑，轉瞬即逝，何僕僕風鹿辛苦勞碌爲？彼一人以爲人生固然免不了一死，但「天生我材必有用」造物既已生我，我就得好好地做一世人。</p>
<p>看，今日社會上的人，不是「醉生夢死」，就是「貪生怕死」，不是「半生半死」，就是「不生不死」他們却美其名曰「明哲保身」。依我看，這些（人實在是「雖主猶死」，乾脆地澴是「生不如死」！</p>
<p>生是人人所喜愛的，死是人人所厭惡的。然而在生死的道途上却沒有顯明的標誌可供我們辨認。有些路子我們認爲是死路而實在是生路。有些路子我們認爲是生路而實在是死路！</p>
<p>生的四週充滿著死，死的四週也佈滿着生。朋友，留心你的脚步！別祇見着死而不見活生，也別祇見着生而不見着死！</p>
<h3 id="c67">不滿足與不知足 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 步仁</p>
<p>一個慾望接着又是一個慾望，年靑的人永遠不會感到滿足。這不滿足的心理就是人類不斷進步的動力，世界前進的輪齒是不滿足的心理所推動，人類生活上一切的改良也是不滿足的心理所促成。</p>
<p>但是，每一個不滿足的心理，在現實上必有其社會的根因。組成社會的並不祗你一個人，當你感到對某一方面不滿足時，你可以想像到擴大的人羣正也與你有着同感。因此，在你滿足慾求時，應該愼重考慮你的手段，自私的攫取他人僅有的一點來塡滿自己的慾壑，那你就該爲世人所詛咒了。而且你也玷辱了人類良好的不滿足的心理。</p>
<p>你沒有滿足你慾求的智能，同時你也沒有明瞭你的慾求所以不能得到滿足的社會的根因，而你一味自私而又盲目的攫取他人的所有來滿足自己，那你便成爲一個粗魯而又卑劣的不知足者了。不知足正與不滿足相反，它是爲人們所不齒的；因爲不知足常會使你不顧他人的利益，擾亂社會，同時陷自己於罪惡與不義而爲社會所詛咒。</p>
<p>不滿足是　得禮讚的，而不知足却應予詛咒；反之，滿足的心境是我們要不得的，知足才是爲我們應取的美德。</p>
<p>對一已生活上一時的享受，我們應該抱知足的心理。對自己的學識智能，我們應該抱永遠不滿足的態度；也唯有這樣，我們才能有所依持，遂漸地充實我們改良環境的手段。逐漸地了解並革除社會上使我們感到不滿足的根因，從而求滿足我們精神上的一切不滿足，以至物質上的一切不滿足。</p>

<p>— 元傑</p>
<p>孟子說：「天將降大任於是人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身，行拂亂其所爲，……這一段話，很有修改的必要。</p>
<p>「天」呀！「神」呀！之類是很渺茫的，說人類的遭遇是決定於渺茫的東西的意志，令人難以相信：倒不如說：「有些受苦，經磨練的人能担當重大的責任。」爲妥。</p>
<p>但這不是說一切受苦的人都能担當重大的責任；有些幸而能維持生存的受苦的人却麻木了！或縱慾了！而愈縱慾，便愈受苦，終於陷入不可自拔的泥淖中，掙扎一生，結果免不了一個毀滅。</p>
<p>這也不是說，能担當重大的責任的人必須受過苦來，只要所受的敎育好，何必一定要受苦呢？至今文化的中心仍是小資產階級，唯有小資產階級才最可能有時間與精力來硏究科學與藝術，來做文化的工作</p>
<p>這是說有些人雖受苦（或者受過苦）但仍能超脫平凡，担當重大的責任，成就偉大的事業。</p>
<p>那就因爲他們雖受苦，却仍有相當發展的機會，他們必有機會受良好的敎育。一面咬緊牙關過羞堅苦卓絕的非輕易的生活；一面自己的生命也有所寄託，不徬徨，不苦悶，也不類喪，憑着濃厚的興趣向着自定的堅定的目標努力工作；又對於偉大的美好的事物，與自己的努力的進展有着虔誠懇摯的信心。</p>
<p>高爾基做苦工，但有三四個朋友訓練得他有唯讀書的嗜好代替了他察閑時一切其他的娛樂。十九歲雖曾一度苦悶而自殺，但被救活，後來一個朋友逼他寫作，自此便脫離苦工生活。</p>
<p>愛因期坦幼時以全力硏究數學，除了數理之外，其他功課一塌糊塗，（不過後來也涉獵哲學生物學與文學書籍）後家庭破產，不得已到瑞士去，受人每月一百法郞的津貼，以八十法郞作生活費，雖營養不足，但幸而仍得以全部時間在大學裏硏究。</p>
<p>法拉第（電學鼻祖）童年做書籍裝訂學徒，老闆贊成他讀店裏的書，後得兄助每星期往皇家學院聽演講，完全筆記下來，後來毛遂自薦進學院做僕役助手之類，得以終生默身科學。</p>
<p>這幾位從苦難中奮鬥出來的偉人，雖受苦，却仍有相當的發展機會，他們自由的範圍是小的，唯其小，他們才戰戰兢兢不敢心猿意馬涉足各方面的享受，而能心無二用，毫無雜念地全神貫注於他們的自由範圍以內的工作，還是環境逼迫他們擺脫他們自由範圍以外的覊絆束縛而把握他們的自由範圍以內的工作的高度發展。他們的精神上有時能得人所不能得的愉悅，甚至狂樂，他們的自我敎肯是極良好的。</p>
<p>可惜他們之中，有的太受苦了！愛因斯坦年青時營飬不良，後來苦於胃病；高爾基年靑時受酷凍而加重他的肺病，後終死於肺病。這些是創造所必需受的苦麼？這是多麽令人扼腕的事？</p>
<p>雖然物質上的優裕不必便是「良好優美的環境」，要是沒有受良好的敎育，有些人便養成爲公子哥兒執胯子弟，高等流氓與現世寳了！但學者從艱苦的環境中出死入生奮鬥出來，本身巳具有堅毅的質素，他們能全力從事改善環境，便最需一個宜於全力研究學問的環境。物質上的困苦是應該排斥的，他們需要家庭衣食生活全有保障，一點也不用自己費心，平靜安寗的研究學問，誰說幾根牙籤，幾枝玻璃管，便可替代設備完全的實驗室呢？</p>
<p>總之：環境的優劣，是取決於經濟與敎育兩者的，而以經濟爲基礎。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Request to City Authorities for Strict Suppression of Gambling <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Gambling is the most prevalent "evil habit" among the people. On a small scale, it leads to wasted time and unemployment, causing personal tragedy; on a large scale, it harms society and brings disgrace to the nation. Looking at the actual situation in our city, gambling venues are crowded with gamblers, and spending thousands of gold coins with a single wave of the hand is considered commonplace. Consequently, all kinds of evil and wicked deeds arise from this. We have investigated recent cases of corruption, speculation, private dealings, and even murder and robbery, and almost all of them are related to gambling dens. If anyone is willing to carefully examine the social news in the newspapers and the records of civil and criminal cases in the judicial organs, it would not be an exaggeration to say that gambling is the sole source of criminal behavior in the city today. As for the general public and families using gambling as a means of entertainment and socializing, it has become regarded as a matter of course. Refusing an invitation is considered ignorant of human relationships. Therefore, if the consumption of spirit, time, money, and legitimate business in everyday gambling is statistically analyzed, the shocking numbers in this city alone are probably beyond the imagination of gamblers.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities, due to the "rampant gambling, neglect of duties, corruption of customs, leading to the abandonment of discipline and moral degradation, which is extremely hateful," have issued an order for "strict investigation and suppression; those who deliberately violate the order will be immediately arrested and severely punished as a warning to others." (April 7th, Nanjing Central News Agency dispatch). However, the ban should not be limited to Nanjing alone, but must extend to all parts of the country, and should not be considered sufficient with a temporary order, but must be persistent, striving to eliminate favoritism and completely eradicate gambling. We believe that not only gambling dens that operate for profit and their disguised forms, such as so-called tea rooms and dance halls, must be thoroughly investigated and suppressed, but also the so-called "leisure-time entertainment" of everyday gambling must be strictly prohibited. At the same time, government agencies and civil servants should take the lead by setting an example; anyone found guilty of gambling and confirmed should be treated as absent without leave, and those with more serious circumstances should be dismissed. Furthermore, major factories and companies should automatically and strictly prevent and warn employees against gambling, and pay special attention to those who arrive late or leave early. This is not only a fundamental way to prevent corruption, but also the first step to improve administrative efficiency or increase productivity. From the perspective of the entire society, strictly prohibiting gambling is the first step in improving customs, preventing treachery, and realizing wartime life. From the perspective of current national policy, strictly prohibiting gambling is a prerequisite for promoting frugality, eliminating extravagance, and concentrating manpower and resources to achieve "total war participation." "Do not refrain from doing good because it is small." We hope that the authorities will advance the work of eliminating gambling with the courage of a broadsword. We remember that a year ago, gambling was openly prevalent in Shanghai's Fourth District, but after the Shanghai West Gendarmerie authorities resolved to ban it, gambling dens in that district had no place to stand. This proves that banning gambling is not a difficult problem, but depends on the determination of the authorities. At the same time, we believe that since gambling dens have been banned in the Shanghai West area, why can they still exist in the Nanshi area? Secondly, there are no more open gambling venues in the Public Concession area, but there are still some in the French Concession area. Being within the same Shanghai city limits, there should not be such differences, let alone such a labor-intensive and financially draining gambling phenomenon in wartime life.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, we must recognize that gambling is a characteristic of national backwardness and unhealthy social life. If this root cause is not eradicated, even the most vigorous bans will only be effective for a short time. Moreover, our country has been weak and poor for a long time, and there are often special circumstances in various places. In the past, a certain province in the Southwest openly used opium sales as the main source of revenue for a province's budget, and today, some regions may use gambling dens as a source of funding for certain expenses, or some people may rely on gambling to maintain their livelihoods. This situation, of course, is an improper phenomenon of "drinking poison to quench thirst," but we should not ignore it. Therefore, when strictly prohibiting gambling, sufficient preparation is necessary, especially to take care of a group of people who used to make a living from gambling, so as not to force them to take risks, and to provide appropriate education to enable them to engage in legitimate occupations. On the active side, we must mobilize the cultural, educational, and journalistic circles to promote the New Culture and wartime life movement, improve national culture, and develop legitimate entertainment. In particular, popularizing drama, movies, song and dance, increasing cultural parks, clubs, and libraries, and promoting sports, skills, and athletic competitions will enable the general public to walk on a bright and happy path and automatically break away from the ghost den of gambling.</p>
<p>Theoretical Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e2">Strengthening the Tojo Cabinet <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Tojo Cabinet implemented a reshuffle of cabinet members on the 21st, which is undoubtedly a preparation for striving for victory. Therefore, rather than calling it a cabinet reshuffle or a cabinet member transfer, it is more appropriate to say that it is a strengthening of the Tojo Cabinet. This time, strengthening the cabinet certainly has its reasons and causes, but we do not want to explore the so-called inside story of the political world.</p>
<p>If one obsessively investigates such news and information, one will lose sight of the essence. Who would believe that the new cabinet members from the old political parties represent the revival of political party power? The appointment of Yamazaki and Oasa, making the pillars of the Seiyokukai, the center of parliamentary power, cabinet members, lies in establishing a truly united national stance. We should accept and accommodate this measure of strengthening the cabinet from a positive perspective. It is gratifying that the Tojo Cabinet can achieve a strong posture adapted to the new stage of the war.</p>
<p>Regarding the reshuffle of the Foreign Minister, which is of most concern to people living abroad, we do not need to think about the reasons for the retirement of the former Foreign Minister Tani, but rather take a positive attitude to anticipate the future diplomatic activities that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will unfold. Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the scope of current diplomatic activities seems to have been limited a lot. However, there is still a lot of diplomatic work with neutral countries, especially with the Soviet Union, where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still bears a great diplomatic task. The new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has rich diplomatic experience and has served as an envoy to the Soviet Union. Now he is in this position, which is a good use of his talents. Moreover, he knows the situation in China very well and can work side by side with Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, who has also been stationed in China. The Tojo Cabinet's policy towards China will undoubtedly be broad, and its policy towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will definitely be promoted smoothly and powerfully.</p>
<p>However, in the context of cabinet member changes, there is not much meaning in discussing the experience, skills, and ambitions of the new cabinet members. We believe that this reshuffle was unavoidable in order to strengthen the Tojo Cabinet; we also believe that strengthening the cabinet and consolidating the politically united national stance will contribute more to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Everything comes from the necessity of advancing the war, which is a measure of unified orientation. Therefore, the cabinet reshuffle was necessary long ago. Not only will the established national policy not be shaken in the slightest by the reshuffle, but it will also be promoted more actively due to the cabinet reshuffle. Therefore, the four words "strengthening the cabinet" are very clear without being explicitly stated. During a political change or cabinet reshuffle, there is often excessive internal observation and divergent opinions. Such speculation only provides the enemy with materials for counter-propaganda, which we must be cautious about in wartime. (Yun Li: Translated from the April 22nd Mainland New Daily)</p>

I am very happy to have the opportunity to visit your country during my inspection of various places in the South. This trip is not to carry out a special official mission, but as the responsible minister of the Japanese foreign policy in the Greater East Asia region, I personally went to the various places in the South to inspect the actual situation, and held talks with the governments of the countries concerned in order to deepen mutual understanding. During this visit to your country, I deeply admire the efforts of your country's leaders in governing the country, promoting the national spirit, and the great spirit of your country's people uniting and supporting your country's leaders with a firm determination to strive to realize their ideals in this period of great change in the world. In addition, it is worthy of congratulations that your country's army has overcome many difficulties and achieved great results in the northern front. Moreover, in this war, if we, the allied countries, cannot unite to defeat Britain and the United States, then we will forever lose the opportunity to eradicate the root of their centuries of aggression in East Asia. The vast land of Greater East Asia will also be completely turned into a colony of Britain and the United States. The autonomy and independence that the Thai people have always loved will also be trampled by them. Japan and its allies have now established a solid foundation for inevitable victory, and the strategic areas and abundant economic resources that Japan has secured have become increasingly stronger. No matter how Britain and the United States launch a counterattack in the future, Japan's combat power will never shake our determination, nor will it shake our unity. There is no doubt about it. Japan has always been a country of faith and righteousness. It is also a country that repays kindness with kindness. Japan is deeply grateful for the sincere cooperation that Thailand has given to Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan will spare no effort to cooperate as much as possible for the prosperity of Thailand and the well-being of the Thai people. I deeply hope that the people of your country will further strengthen their belief in victory and their cooperation with Japan in the future, and strive to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Anniversary of the Reorganization of the Second Front Army Chairman Wang Specially Issues Instructions Commander-in-Chief Sun Liangcheng Also Expresses His Determination <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) The 22nd is the anniversary of the reorganization of the Second Front Army. The Military Commission, in the instructions specially issued by Chairman Wang, encouraged all officers and soldiers to contribute everything to the country with a spirit of deep wisdom and courage. Commander-in-Chief Sun Liangcheng also issued his anniversary thoughts, expressing his determination to defend the motherland and protect East Asia. The following is a partial record:</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Instructions Today is the anniversary of the reorganization of the Second Front Army. This Chairman is extremely excited. On this day last year, Commander-in-Chief Sun and all the officers and soldiers, based on their patriotic enthusiasm, abandoned the misguided resistance and participated in the bright peace. Their automatic reorganization was a manifestation of true knowledge and insight. The teachings of the National Father have long indicated to us to "save China through peace and struggle," and to cooperate with Japan to realize "Pan-Asianism." We must strive to follow them to the death, otherwise, although we are patriotic in name, we are actually harming the country; although we are protecting the people in name, we are actually harming the people. Moreover, now that the peace movement has entered the stage of participating in the war, it is the time for China to strive for independence and freedom. All the officers and soldiers of our Second Front Army should promote their original intentions, work hard and diligently, be loyal and trustworthy, contribute everything to the group of families, be wise and courageous, rectify the army and prepare for war, so as to join hands with our friendly country of Japan to complete the Greater East Asia Liberation War, and to achieve the great mission of reviving China and protecting East Asia. The bright future of the country and the people, the honor and disgrace of all of you officers and soldiers, are all tied to this. Let us encourage each other.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Sun's Thoughts</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, fellow comrades, on this day last year—April 22nd, our army, in view of the people's suffering from the futile resistance and the impossibility of helping the current crisis, resolutely and decisively telegraphed for reorganization. Under the leadership of our highest leader, Chairman Wang, we followed the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building," and closely cooperated with our friendly country of Japan to fight for the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Thanks to the full assistance of the friendly army and the enthusiastic guidance of all the officers and soldiers, all the officers and soldiers of our army know what to be inspired by and devote their loyalty and courage to repay the country. I am very pleased with this. Time flies like a shuttle. In the blink of an eye, a week has passed. When we hold the anniversary commemoration today, when we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we cannot help but feel touched in our hearts and inform our compatriots and comrades, and take this opportunity to express our encouragement to all the officers and soldiers of our army. After telegraphing for reorganization, I have already stated that the resistance cannot be sustained. Therefore, what the officers and soldiers of our army have worked hard to do in the past year is to devote themselves to the peace movement and to support participation in the war. These two major tasks and missions are connected to each other in the vertical aspect and run in parallel in the horizontal aspect. From resistance to peace, and then to participating in the Greater East Asia War, it has always been a consistent proposition. Our government authorities have repeatedly indicated to us. I believe that the current way to save the country is nothing more than peace and war. If peace is hopeless, there is only war. If peace comes, we can abandon war and seek peace. If war is death, and not war is also death, then there is only war to show the personality of a loyal, brave, and patriotic person. If war is death, and peace is survival, but we are still exhausting our troops and prolonging the war, it is no different from leading beasts to eat people. Not only will the people be unable to live, but it will also ruin the country. The purpose of the resistance is to seek the survival and independence of the country. If the war can be ended with a peace that is in line with justice, then the survival and independence of the country can be guaranteed. Therefore, our army should respond to the needs of the times, observe the direction of the people's hearts, and make a proposition of conscience. On this day last year, we resolutely telegraphed to participate in the peace camp, still based on the consistent spirit of teaching the country in the past, and worked hard for the peace movement. However, there are many thorns in the future of the peace movement. The Communist Party is causing trouble internally, and Britain and the United States are provoking externally, all of which are enough to undermine China's peace and East Asia's construction. Our friendly country of Japan has insight into the international situation, penetrates the conspiracy of the Communist Party, and the ambition of Britain and the United States. It is confirmed that unless we seek to prevent communism, we will not be able to eradicate the red scourge, and unless we destroy Britain and the United States, we will not be able to liberate East Asia. Therefore, Japan does not hesitate to make the greatest sacrifices, on the one hand, resolutely prevents communism to curb the spread of materialistic red, and on the other hand, advances the holy war to eliminate imperialist aggressors from East Asia. Since our National Government returned to the capital, it has also been based on this common goal for common struggle. It has already decided on the grand plan of peace and announced the policy of participating in the war, and indicated the purpose of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together, cooperating with our friendly country to overcome the difficulties of the times, and promote the great achievements of nation-building and promoting Asia. I am in charge of the division of the army, and my responsibility is to defend the country. I only know how to obey the orders of my superiors, be realistic, bury myself in hard work, and not indulge in empty words or showy decorations. Therefore, as far as I can do, I am cautious and diligent. Because of practice, since the reorganization, I have made it an urgent task to eliminate the Communist bandits, appease the refugees, and consolidate the security of the rear, so as to support the progress of the Greater East Asia War and make full peace a reality as soon as possible. All the officers and soldiers of our army should first understand the true meaning of peace and participation in the war, and strengthen their beliefs and centralize their will. We must strive to enforce discipline, refresh our ranks, take the same steps, endure hardships, unite in one wind, and go to the opportunity together. With the heart of loving the people, we love the people, and with the power to support the dangerous and stabilize the country, we defend the country. This is what I earnestly encourage all the officers and soldiers of our army on the anniversary of the reorganization. The overall peace of China and the final victory of East Asia are the goals. I believe that in the near future, we will be joyful and dance and sing songs of victory together. I wish that our compatriots and comrades will do their best efforts. I can't help but pray for it.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In order to strengthen the wartime economic system, the National Government is actively promoting all economic construction and sparing no effort. Recently, in order to stabilize prices and suppress speculative hoarding, it has specially dispatched officials to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation and impose appropriate penalties. A reporter specially interviewed the responsible official of the Ministry of Finance, who kindly informed them of the handling of the matter as follows: "Previously, the Ministry believed that speculation in Shanghai was rampant and prices were soaring daily. The root cause lies in the abundance of floating capital, which has not been brought under regulation. If strict restrictions are not imposed, the national economy and the people's livelihood will be severely affected. In order to eliminate hidden dangers, the Ministry has formulated three measures to restrict loans from silver and money shops, strictly ordering the industry associations of silver and money shops in various places to abide by them and to supervise each other's strict implementation. This time, a large-scale speculative hoarding of important materials was discovered in Shanghai. After investigation, it was confirmed that Han Gongbei of the Zhenhua Company was indeed illegally hoarding important materials, and the Futong Bank was suspected of being heavily involved. The National Government has issued a clear order for separate penalties. As for the Futong Bank under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, it has reported its compliance with the Ministry's order to temporarily suspend business and await thorough investigation. Deposits of all depositors will continue to be paid as usual. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, the Ministry has repeatedly sent letters to the Financial Business Inspection Office and the Ministry's Shanghai Office, instructing them to continue actively investigating unfinished matters related to financial institutions. If financial institutions are found to have engaged in illegal speculation and hoarding, they will be severely punished to ensure that hoarders disappear, prices stabilize, to secure the people's livelihood and stabilize finance, so that the wartime economic system can be smoothly advanced."</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Manchukuo Local Officials Administrative Inspection Group has come to China for sightseeing. A reporter specially interviewed the head of the group, Mr. An Jiyun, currently a councillor of the General Affairs Agency of the Manchukuo State Council, on the 22nd, while the group was staying in Beijing. Mr. An kindly answered the reporter's questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the mission of your group's visit to China?</p>
<p>(Answer) Manchukuo's purpose in visiting China is to strengthen the economic effectiveness of mutual communication, borrowing strengths, and supplementing weaknesses between the axis of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in East Asia, and to examine the political facilities of the emerging China to be used as a reference for domestic administration. At the same time, because the unity between countries depends on mutual understanding, more visits mean more understanding. This is the second purpose of our group's visit to China. Because China has experienced disturbances, consecutive years of disasters, and poor harvests, we, based on the initial intentions of caring for our own countries, loving our neighbors, and loving East Asia together, feel that it is necessary to provide assistance. Earlier this month, Chinese Special Envoy Mr. Zhou Fohai visited Manchukuo, and it is firmly believed that the relationship between China and Manchukuo will become closer in the future, and the economies of the two countries will benefit more. Our group's visit to China is also to examine the needs of the allied country China to serve as a guideline for increasing production in various places after returning home. This is the third purpose of our visit to China.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the reason for the smooth distribution of materials in your country?</p>
<p>(Answer) The distribution of materials first investigates the existing materials in the area, creates a household register, and distributes them evenly. As for the prerequisite for suppressing prices, it is nothing more than first investigating the quantity of existing commodities, especially strictly prohibiting private hoarding, restricting the free movement of unscrupulous merchants, and setting prices so that prices do not rise. More should be to practice frugal consumption and increase the tax rate on luxury goods so that they lose purchasing power and naturally reduce the ability to consume. On the one hand, the government encourages production and provides farmers with low-interest loans. Those who meet the set annual increase standard will have the special privilege of enjoying the distribution of a large number of daily necessities. The government raises the standard every year, and the production rate also increases frequently, prices are suppressed, and supply exceeds demand, so the distribution of materials can be smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your impressions after inspecting Beijing?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the three years since the Republic of China returned to the capital, all political, economic, cultural, and other facilities have been developing rapidly. The general public can carry out the New Citizen Movement, unite sincerely, and the future is bright and promising.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Deputy President Promoted from Goto Fumio; Murata Goro Appointed Vice Minister of Information <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Deputy President Ando has now been appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, and after careful consideration by President Tojo, it was decided to promote Goto Fumio, the current Secretary-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to fill the vacancy of Deputy President. At 1:00 p.m. today, President Tojo summoned Mr. Goto to the Prime Minister's residence and, after discussing the matter, obtained his consent and formally appointed him on the same day. At the same time, it was decided that the new Deputy President would concurrently serve as Secretary-General and head of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association Youth Corps. The official announcement was made by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in the afternoon, stating: "Since the founding of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, new Deputy President Goto has been engaged in promoting work in the central part of the Association. Since May of last year, he has served as Secretary-General and is the master of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. This promotion to Deputy President will not have a special impact on the inside, but because he has a close relationship with former Deputy President Ando, the relationship between the government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will be closer, and at this stage of the war, the promotion of the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement to supplement the function of administration and the harmony with the internal administration of Minister of Internal Affairs Ando can be expected to operate appropriately and vigorously."</p>
<p>Berlin Welcomes Partial Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the news of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet was released, all sectors here unanimously expressed their welcome. Knowledgeable sources commented as follows: (1) This reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is purely due to internal affairs, and Japan's national policy will not change as a result. (2) The Japanese government's appointment of influential figures from political parties and respected figures in the diplomatic community shows Prime Minister Tojo's determination to gather the total strength of Japan's 100 million people and establish a decisive battle system to win the final victory. (3) Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is a first-class Japanese diplomat, and his diplomatic skills have always been admired by the European diplomatic community. Therefore, after Mr. Shigemitsu took office as Foreign Minister and Mr. Amau took office as Director-General of the Information Bureau, the diplomatic and propaganda lineup of the Japanese government will definitely be strengthened. In addition, Dr. Horn, a diplomatic correspondent for the German official news agency, said that the German political circles have a very good impression of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet on Tuesday night, and said that the new Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui will definitely intensify Japan's policy in Greater East Asia. The correspondent pointed out that Shigemitsu has repeatedly visited Germany, so he is also well-known in Germany, and the German Foreign Ministry believes that he is one of Japan's most capable diplomats. Dr. Horn also praised Shigemitsu's achievements in promoting Sino-Japanese relations and stressed that Shigemitsu, when he was the ambassador to the United Kingdom, never left any doubts about Japan's attitude towards the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Britain Remains Silent</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Reuters London, the British government remained silent on this cabinet reshuffle in Japan, and the official did not criticize it. However, knowledgeable sources attached great importance to Mr. Shigemitsu's appointment as Foreign Minister because he had served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom and then transferred to Ambassador to China, believing that Japanese Prime Minister Tajo obviously wanted to strengthen the relationship between China and Japan diplomatically and coordinate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greater East Asia Ministry internally.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Mushanokoji Writes Article on the Advantages of Eastern Spiritual Culture; China-Japan Cooperation is Essential for its Promotion <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese famous writer Saneatsu Mushanokoji recently went to Nanjing as a representative of the Japanese cultural community to attend the second conference of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and interacted with people from the Chinese cultural community. After returning to Japan, he wrote an article from the perspective of the world's art history, pointing out the beauty of Eastern spiritual culture. The gist is as follows: (1) The mission of East Asia, as I see it, is that Europe was once more advanced than Asia in terms of civilization, and this is indeed a fact. Also, we have learned a lot from them, and this is also a fact. At present, in terms of material civilization, they (especially the UK and the US) are superior to us, which is even more of a fact. However, they are complacent and despise us, and they consider themselves qualified to dominate Asia. And because they consider themselves the masters of the world, they discriminate against people of color. They also believe that dominating Asia is necessary for world culture, so when they dominate Asia, they do not consider this to be an immoral act but rather consider it to be saving Asia. At the same time, their arrogant attitude has fallen into a state of being unable to save themselves, and it is inevitable that they will use all the resources of Asia for their living culture. Taking the UK's attitude towards India as an example, it is not only extremely obvious but also fully expresses its ambition, so they must regard Asia as no different from India. However, they will eventually fail due to their arrogance, and at this point, Asian culture will shine again, and the mission of East Asia lies here. Western European countries such as Germany and Italy have fully recognized the mission of East Asia and believe that helping to promote Asian culture is necessary for their own culture. However, countries such as the UK and the US have not yet felt the mission of East Asia and still regard Asia as their prey, viewing Japan as a thorn in their side, and hindering Japan in various aspects. Japan, in unbearable circumstances, rose up resolutely, and the most peace-loving Emperor of Japan issued a great edict to propagate to the UK and the US, and we were moved by this holy heart, which is the mission of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, this mission is completely in line with what all mankind hopes for. The UK and the US have successively returned the places they should have returned. However, not only have they not realized that their defeat was due to being conquered by the truth, but they have not stopped their ambition to dominate Asia and are still obsessed with it, exhausting all their efforts to try to satisfy their desires and wasting great sacrifices. In fact, the United States is the most foolish in this war. Except for the United States, other countries have no choice but to fight. Among them, there are those like the UK whose desires are too deep and will never give up, so they have no choice but to fight, so the United States also said that its participation in the war was out of necessity, but it was also okay if the United States did not fight, because if the United States did not participate in the war, it would definitely be a favorable country in the world. Not only would the country become richer and stronger, but its people would also live and work in peace. However, they actually wanted to get involved in the war, making unnecessary sacrifices, and the people of many countries had the illusion that only the United States could save the world, so this move by the United States was extremely foolish, but this was nothing more than a punishment from heaven for their arrogance. (2) Their ideas and culture are finally coming to an end. We can believe that new life is struggling in the world, and the greatest of these new things that will soon be produced is the recovery of East Asia. At the same time, it will soon become the revival of Asia. In fact, when China and Japan can fully cooperate with each other, it will be the time when Asia has declared its victory. The world is now looking forward to this day, so Japan rose up resolutely. In fact, the present is the middle of the war, and the rise and fall of East Asia can be determined today. We deeply feel the importance of this war, but we have no anxiety about the final victory. In this war, the truth is always by our side, and we are even more convinced that this is what mankind hopes for, and the mission of East Asia is first to liberate East Asia from the hands of the UK and the US. Its meaning is to make the people of the world aware of the mission of each having their place and creating their own culture, because there will never be a race in the world that considers itself only to be despised and not matter. We, with the qualifications of a despised race, first warn the UK and the US of the unreasonableness of despising races and urge them to reflect. It is true that their material civilization is more advanced than ours, but this is not because of the excellence of the race. We have only been slightly delayed in adopting world culture due to various reasons. However, we do not belittle their many excellent qualities. The only thing in the world that can best speak to the national character of a country is art. One can know its true nature at a glance. Among the paintings of various countries in the world, the one that can best express its arrogant character is the UK. Also, among the many portraits in the world, the portraits that are the most devoid of content and full of arrogant character are also from the UK. As for the paintings of the United States, they are the most pitiful. The nature of their paintings does not have advantages in terms of spirit, but the paintings that are extremely light and make people feel shallow are the ones they respect the most, so their paintings can never match the work of Korin in Japan, but there are more than a hundred people in Japan whose works are even better than Korin's. In East Asia, China has the most outstanding calligraphers and painters, while in the West, only Italy, France, and the Netherlands have outstanding painters. (3) They do not understand the deep interest in the paintings of the Arhats in East Asia, and they always say that they are the ugliness of the people of East Asia. This is because they cannot understand their spiritual depth. At the same time, they have no understanding of our simple and elegant places. We see the material civilization of New York in the United States, and it can really surprise us, but ask whether the value of human beings is estimated by material or by spirit? I believe that the value of human beings should be estimated by spirit. They do not know what kind of life the Christian Church that they respect the most is living. I wonder if they have ever really thought about it. We will make them understand the spiritual purity and joy that they have forgotten. Of course, there are also things that the Eastern people do not know, but we should awaken their stubbornness to the beauty of nature and the beauty of elegant culture, so that they can live in their proper places and have a sense of satisfaction. At the same time, let them know that the world should respect each other in order to be happy. The above is the important task of our cultural community in East Asia. At least in the West, there are people who have progressed in spirit, and I am afraid they have felt that Western culture has come to an end, and they hope that the original culture of the East will grow healthily with the taste it has gained from the world and complete what they deeply entrust. I hope we can cooperate with each other to complete this great mission.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Tunisia Region: Great Battle Enters Fourth Stage; Two Fierce Attacks on Enfidaville Fail; British Eighth Army Suffers Heavy Losses from Landmines <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported last night: On Tuesday, the British Eighth Army repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the Axis forces' bridgehead south of the northeastern Tunisian stronghold, but were repelled by the German-Italian allied forces. Berlin claims that the current fighting is the fourth stage of the Tunisian War, which began on the evening of the 1st. The British army has been attacking in the Enfidaville area for 24 hours without any progress. In the first night's attack, the British army suffered heavy losses due to landmines. After several hours of shelling, they launched a second attack, which also failed and they retreated.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to news received here on the 21st: The British Eighth Army has launched a general offensive on the southeastern Tunisian front for more than 36 hours, but has not yet broken through the Axis forces' strong positions. As for the course of the battle, the British army first launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the Axis positions near Enfidaville on the night of the 19th, and then began a new offensive. The range of the attack was more than 20 kilometers wide, but it suffered heavy casualties due to landmines planted by the Axis forces. Thus, the British army's first day of attack failed. The next day, the British army resumed the attack. Although they broke through several Axis positions, they were retaken by the Axis forces after a fierce counterattack. Currently, the terrain of the positions set up by the Axis forces is not suitable for large-scale tank warfare, especially the western defense line, which is mostly mountainous. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces launched an offensive in the more flat area of Enfidaville. In short, because the anti-Axis forces cannot attack the Axis positions from the side, they have to attack head-on. However, it will be difficult for the anti-Axis forces to make rapid progress in a frontal offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The fourth round of the Tunisian War seems to have begun. After several hours of intense artillery preparation, the British Eighth Army launched an attack on the southern flank of the German-Italian forces' positions with strong troops on the evening of April 20th. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. It was claimed here yesterday: So far, all major attacks by the anti-Axis forces have been repelled. The anti-Axis forces only entered the Axis positions at a few strongholds, but were quickly driven back. The area of Enfidaville near the coast is the focus of the battle in the southern Tunisian front. General Montgomery's British troops have assembled a large force in this area in an attempt to break through the Italian-held line. At present, the enemy's attempts in this area cannot be considered successful, and the attacking British troops have been repelled. The Italian army also counterattacked and regained the temporarily lost territory. The Italian army at each stronghold was almost able to drive the enemy back to the original line. The terrain in the combat area makes it extremely difficult for large tanks to operate. The German side claims that the German-Italian forces in the middle and western sections of the front occupy high ground and are not easily attacked by tank units. Only on the southern flank, especially in the Enfidaville area, is the terrain relatively flat and larger forces can be deployed. However, military experts in Berlin believe that a flanking maneuver is not possible in the current Tunisian front. The British and American forces can only try to break through the wide front. Berlin remains optimistic about the situation in this area.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Axis Forces Defend with Natural Barriers, Forming a Siege Fortress Battle <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - A German military spokesman said last night: The Tunisian war has now become a siege fortress battle. The British General Montgomery's Eighth Army is fully equipped, and it can be said that it has everything needed for desert warfare. However, in the current fighting, most of this equipment has become useless, because in the Enfidaville area, only a small, narrow strip of land on the coast is suitable for large-scale tank warfare. The other parts of the Tunisian front are mountainous. If a large-scale offensive is to be launched, other methods must be used. Therefore, German military experts believe that the anti-Axis forces will encounter difficult problems in this new phase of the war. The German-Italian positions in the mountainous area form a semi-circle, surrounding the main strongholds of Tunis and Bizerte. Berlin calls it the Axis powers' main line of defense in North Africa. Compared with the battle for the Mareth Line a few days ago, the current battle can be called a battle for forward positions. It is believed here that the first offensive by the British and American forces has failed. Although the British have penetrated the enemy's line in several places, they have not been able to take advantage of it and have retreated after a German-Italian counterattack. Therefore, the entire line is still firmly held by the German-Italian forces and has not been shaken.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Anti-Axis newspapers in Moscow reported last night that German mountain troops, assisted by engineering units and Black Shirt sharpshooters, launched a fierce attack on the mountain positions held by the Soviet army in the Kuban estuary delta. The German official news agency said that German and Romanian mountain troops launched a fierce attack on Tuesday and expanded their high ground near Novorossiysk. News from Berna said that the German-Romanian allied forces, in close cooperation with the German Air Force, attacked the Soviet outpost positions and resisted Soviet counterattacks. Moscow claims that the German offensive in the Kuban estuary delta has been repelled by the Soviet army. Both sides suffered heavy damage in the fierce fighting. Moscow has confirmed active fighting in the Novorossiysk area, with successive attacks and counterattacks. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet landed troops west of Novorossiysk and attacked again, but Moscow admits that Novorossiysk itself is not under serious threat because the German army's strong defenses block the road to the port. According to anti-Axis reporters stationed in Moscow, the Soviet army continues to bombard German positions in the hope of overcoming German resistance. They believe that it is difficult for the German army to transport military supplies to the troops in the area. There were no significant developments in other areas of the Eastern Front last night.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Germany Invents New Weapon; Tiger Tank Divisions to Join the War Soon <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Recent German statements regarding the development of German military technology have raised the question of when the German side will begin to use its latest weapon, the "Tiger" tank division, in combat. This new type of tank has been the focus of international attention in the past few weeks. Its turret can rotate 360 degrees, so it is the first motorized warfare vehicle that can fire in all directions. During the winter months, Germany has been working hard domestically, and the "Tiger" tank, which the German army will soon use in combat, is proof of this.</p>

<p>Sofia, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The new Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Noburo Hidaka, departed from here for Rome on the evening of the 20th. Before his departure, he met with a group of reporters and made remarks, mainly stating: The Japanese government hopes to strengthen political and economic relations with European allied nations participating in the Axis alliance and is prepared to assist Europe with abundant raw material resources. It intends to provide the greatest assistance to the Balkan countries. Japan attaches particular importance to its relationship with Bulgaria and hopes that relations between Japan and Bulgaria will become more stable. Japan, Germany, and Italy are currently conducting joint operations according to a common plan, so the activities of one country are closely related to the activities of the other two countries. Germany and Italy are building a new order based on justice in Europe, and Japan is also aiming to build the same new order in Greater East Asia. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are very normal, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be said to have achieved its intended purpose. No matter what attempts the United Kingdom and the United States make, we can wait for future developments with peace of mind. The United Kingdom and the United States are fighting in the Pacific and are unable to launch a major offensive. Japan is fully prepared for any major situation. In short, Japan has completed its planned operations in East Asia and is now completely free. The Japanese fleet and air force control the entire southwestern Pacific region, and in Burma, the British army has been paralyzed. The enemy will probably not be able to engage in combat before the end of May.</p>

On the other hand, Roosevelt's speech was actually just an appeal for Mexico to hand over its natural resources for the use of the United States. In short, Roosevelt's speech does not conceal the fact that he considers Mexico to be no different from an American colony, as the Americans plan to obtain the raw materials and labor they need from Mexico.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Axis Forces Seize the Opportunity <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Berlin, 15th) - The German-Italian Axis forces in a corner of northeastern Tunisia seem to want to defend Africa's only position to the death. Both the Axis and Allied camps have ulterior motives regarding the outcome of the North African war, and their secret plans are preconditions for the next major battle. The Asahi Shimbun's Berlin branch contacted its Lisbon branch by international long-distance telephone on the 15th to inquire about the situation in Tunisia. The questions and answers are recorded below.</p>
<p>Berlin Correspondent Mamoru Yamasato (Q): From Berlin's perspective, the situation in Tunisia is not very clear because the line of sight is not good. It is not entirely clear where the center of the battle is. You are in a neutral country and can obtain information from both sides. Please tell me something about the current situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon Correspondent Mogi (A): We can only see British newspapers a day late, so we can only get a general idea of ​​the enemy's intentions, but the real situation is not clear. Even some people who seem to be very clear are actually only half-knowing. The focus of public concern here is whether the combined forces of Rommel and Arnim can fight to the death to defend Tunis and Bizerte. What is the determination of the German and Italian armies?</p>
<p>(Q): This question has been carefully discussed at the recent meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, and it has already been decided. Of course, the content will not be told to the world. The German army is not so stupid as to announce this kind of confidential content. The enemy is afraid of not knowing the details, so why would the German army announce it?</p>
<p>(A): Axis officials here believe that Tunis and Bizerte will definitely be defended to the death. Just look at the example of the Soviet army refusing to give up Stalingrad to the death, and you can imagine this situation. Looking at the Soviet Union, even after the rear transport of a small number of troops in the Volga was cut off, they still defended a corner of Stalingrad to the death. Then, even if communication with Sicily is cut off in the North African war, it is not impossible to fight a long-term war if the Tunis and Bizerte fortresses are defended.</p>
<p>(Q): The German side now has great hope. With the Bizerte and Tunis fortresses as the center, a position is established in the nearby mountainous area, and the natural terrain that is sufficient for defense is used to form a solid turtle shell formation. On the other hand, because the enemy has advanced the front line by 2,500 kilometers, they urgently need to reorganize the rear supply line. If they want to launch a general offensive on this turtle shell position, they must reorganize their troops. As a result, the Axis forces in Tunisia are willing to find an opportunity to launch without losing time. This is the hope of Germany and the general view of the German people.</p>
<p>(A): Looking at the movements of Rommel's army, I think the word "time" is the most appropriate. In January of this year, the British always said that the Tunisian war would definitely end by the end of March. At least, the Soviet offensive would not weaken, and the landing operation would begin in Europe. However, this claim has not been realized because the main force of the Allied forces was led to North Africa by Rommel's army. If Kursk and Kharkov had been recovered by the Soviet army, and the North African war situation was as tense as it is now, then the Axis forces would inevitably face a major crisis. Now, because the Eastern Front has come to an end, the Axis forces will not suffer the disadvantage of fighting on two fronts. What do the German people think about this North African war?</p>
<p>(Q): The Germans here are able to remain calm and composed. The deep and painful expression of the Sixth Army when it was besieged in Stalingrad cannot be seen at all. There are various reasons for this: first, the war situation has not yet reached the severity of Stalingrad. The general public believes in General Rommel, because he is a famous general who can win by surprise, so Rommel's strategy of shrinking the front line and preparing for a surprise offensive is deeply trusted by the public. Second, there has been no concealment of the circumstances from the retreat from Egypt to Libya and Tunisia, so the German people are calm and understand the war principle that success and failure are common occurrences for soldiers. The Germans' shock at the Battle of Stalingrad was because the former German authorities did not tell the truth and concealed the facts for two months, and then announced the shocking truth when the situation was irreversible, so the people were saddened and discolored, but the situation in the North African war is very different, so there is no such shocking phenomenon.</p>
<p>(A): According to recent intelligence: From the 10th to the 11th of this month, British and American convoy ships passed through Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean. This convoy is probably not going to the Tunisian front, but to merge with the troops waiting in Algeria for the second front, preparing for the next operation in advance.</p>
<p>In short, the Tunisian front is a guide to promote the European war, and it must not be taken lightly or ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Significance of the Meeting Between the Two Giants of Germany and Italy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Rome, Yamazaki, 12th) - The meeting between Hitler and Mussolini is the culmination of the previous meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop in Rome, and is a follow-up to that meeting. Rear Admiral Bori visited Italy, and Mussolini met with the prime ministers of Italy and Hungary, and Hitler met with King Boris of Bulgaria. A series of top-level meetings on the Axis side were held. The external significance is to respond to the European post-war management plan of the United Kingdom and the United States. That is to say, this meeting focused on the following two issues:</p>
<p>First, through the reconstruction and reorganization of the new order in Europe, Europe will be formed into a united and powerful collaborative body, making it the foundation for the execution of war and post-war management;</p>
<p>Second, with the foresight that this year will be the stage for the European War to reach a decision, concentrate the final efforts in all fields of military, political, and diplomatic affairs to create the most favorable new situation.</p>
<p>The first issue mentioned above was an unresolved issue from the previous meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop. This meeting, based on the sincere and frank opinions of the Italian side, realized closer cooperation between Germany and Italy, and cooperation between the countries under the leadership of the two countries. Here are the points:</p>
<p>(1) The solution of various pending issues between the two countries and all European countries, and the consideration of guarantees in accordance with what form;</p>
<p>(2) Efforts to resolve the Outer Transylvania (Transylvania) issue and Hungary's active participation in the current war;</p>
<p>(3) Strengthening Bulgaria's cooperation with allied countries;</p>
<p>Etc., will be specially discussed. In short, as proposed by Prime Minister Mussolini earlier:</p>
<p>"Although the nature of European countries and Asian countries is completely different, we can learn a lot from the attitude that Japan is taking regarding the construction of a new East Asia."</p>
<p>Judging from this claim, it is not difficult to imagine that the above-mentioned new reorganization must be carried out following the same guidelines and forms as the ideology of the new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>As for the second issue, it may be regarded as starting from the premise of the first issue, and is full of variability. That is:</p>
<p>(1) France's maintenance of public order and coastal defense; (2) Greece's defense; (3) Bulgaria's coastal defense and other defensive natures; and (4) the Eastern Front's offensive this summer: the future of the Tunisian Front, (6) changes in the situation in Turkey due to Bulgaria's active cooperation.</p>
<p>Etc., all military and political measures that should be dealt with under the current situation can be considered to have been reviewed. The United Kingdom and the United States have promoted the meeting between the two giants as being about how to defend against the intrusion of the United Kingdom and the United States into Europe. However, the meeting was originally scheduled to be held before the changes in the situation on the Tunisian front. However, the departure of Prime Minister Mussolini was delayed due to changes in the situation. The purpose of this meeting, guaranteed by the Italian government and the public, is not determined by some changes in a local battle, but is to thoroughly solve the fundamental problems within Europe and to build future development on this basis. Therefore, this meeting is by no means a passive defensive meeting, but a positive meeting for future construction. Its results, even if they are not how gorgeous, undoubtedly express its character extremely eloquently in the new European order and the execution of the war.

<h3 id="e37">The Authorities Continue to Investigate Hoarding; Commodity Prices Gradually Stabilize; Hoarders Continuously Emerge, Supply Exceeding Demand; Retail Prices in Various Industries Show No Decline <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the National Government, in view of the soaring commodity prices in Shanghai, which seemed endless, mostly attributed to speculative hoarding, believed that if such behavior was not thoroughly eliminated, it would have a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, it specially dispatched the Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai to, together with Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Business Management Committee, jointly investigate hoarding and impose special penalties. It also supervised and urged strict handling of the lending business of various silver and money industries and banks, refusing loans for speculative hoarding purposes in accordance with the "Measures for Eliminating Secured Loans" promulgated by the Ministry, and at the same time, contracted previously released loans. As a result, hoarders have been in a state of panic recently, seeking to get out of their predicament. Market prices of various industries have gradually decreased. It is reported that the market conditions of important commodities continued to decline yesterday, and people's hearts have been more stable than in the past. The main reasons are: (1) The government authorities are continuing to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and are currently investigating the stockpiles in various warehouses. (2) The silver and money industries are refusing to grant new loans and recovering old loans, and hoarders with insufficient capital turnover are seeking to get out of their predicament. (3) The Business Management Committee is now actively carrying out control work. Since the matter of applying for permits for the movement of materials began, materials can be freely moved within the specified area, the circulation of goods is smooth, and with hoarders constantly emerging, the market presents a situation of supply exceeding demand. Due to the above problems, commodity prices are declining day by day. However, the retail prices of various business stores have not declined accordingly. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this in order to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Japanese Army Press Department Yesterday Hosted the Press Corps, Describing the Weaknesses of the American Army in Various Aspects <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Press Department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, at a regular meeting of the city's press corps, expressed his views on recent comments by British and American military critics on the Japanese-American war:</p>
<p>Unfavorable Terrain. First, he stated that the general American public has been repeatedly deceived by the U.S. government's propaganda reports, so they are unclear about the details of the Japanese-American war. Now, some American critics, with accurate judgment, have made detailed analyses and criticisms of the war situation announced by the U.S. government. The Japanese spokesperson first cited the American critics' explanation of the terrain, saying that there are currently three ways to attack Japan: (1) Using the mainland in Chongqing. Geographically speaking, although China is close to Japan, it is of no practical help in terms of military situation. In addition, transportation is inconvenient and full of difficulties. Even if air transport is used, the number of aircraft, manpower, materials, and gasoline are not enough for distribution, so it is difficult to achieve the illusory dream. (2) Using Australia as a base. However, the distance between Australia and the United States is far away. The journey from Los Angeles to Australia requires 12,000 nautical miles. Even with transport ships, ships are difficult to obtain and require refueling along the way. Even if they can reach Australia as desired, attacking the Japanese mainland to the north is separated by the South Seas. Moreover, the large and small islands near the Solomon Islands are all under Japanese control, and there is no attacking force. Therefore, the American critics said that if they want to attack the Japanese mainland, they must use naval and land forces to conquer all the large and small islands. (3) Furthermore, from Alaska to the Aleutian Islands, it is still questionable whether there is enough energy to replenish the distance in between. In addition, the journey is vast and transportation is difficult, so it is difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Resources. Since the Japanese army began the Greater East Asia War, it had already occupied famous places in tropical, frigid, and temperate zones. Moreover, these places are rich in resources, which are not only fully utilized by Japan, but also actively engaged in production. All resources have fallen into Japanese hands. Therefore, if the United States plans to counterattack Japan, it must fully replenish each military force. However, it is already difficult to replenish. Furthermore, in terms of military strength, the United States intends to wage a protracted war and plans to increase its army to 8.5 million by next year. Otherwise, it will not achieve the purpose of counterattack. Now, regardless of that, sending troops from the United States to New Zealand requires mobilizing 1.05 million people in fact, based on calculations of its deployment. Therefore, with such a huge military force, it is even more difficult to fulfill the plan. Therefore, American military critics have specifically raised three major issues regarding the U.S. government's counterattack against Japan: terrain, resources, and troop mobilization. Their conclusion clearly reveals that it is difficult to achieve in fact. In particular, although troop strength can be trained and mobilized, when this huge number can be completed, we can get a glimpse of it by observing the current military strength of the United States.</p>
<p>Nothing Gained. The Japanese spokesperson also announced the situation of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, using the southwestern area as an observation and judgment. It is said that since the end of March and the beginning of April of this year, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has made the delusion of sudden movement, dispatched from Guilin, Hunan. Its purpose was to attack the peaceful area and make silly dreams in Taiwan, Central China, or the Japanese mainland. As a result, it achieved nothing, only taking unconscious actions in the vicinity of the departure point, without any gains. Currently, the actual strength of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is 150 to 160 aircraft, which are fighter planes and bombers. Among the bombers, there are very few large aircraft, which have the ambition to attack, but have no real strength. On the contrary, the strength of the Japanese Air Force in China is sufficient to cope with it. If the United States counterattacks, it must wait until the Japanese Air Force in China is completely wiped out. In addition, even if the United States can dispatch from the Chongqing base, the Japanese Air Force in China will immediately give it a head-on blow and wipe out its base, so that it cannot return. Therefore, the current actions of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing are only small-scale guerrilla warfare, taking advantage of unpreparedness to launch surprise attacks. However, before the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing replenishes its strength, we will not find it difficult to annihilate it. Finally, the Japanese spokesperson gave detailed instructions on air defense preparations, saying that we should not ignore it and should give it meticulous protection, etc.</p>

<p>The tenth phase of household rice for April in the first and second districts of the western district of Shanghai, totaling 5,650 bags, has been shipped by the district's public sales office. It has been decided that it will be sold simultaneously by 55 public sales offices in the district starting today. Each person will receive 2.35 liters of polished rice, priced at 7.05 yuan. It is also learned that the back of the rice purchase certificate must be filled in with the household's affiliated Baojia district system, and the head of the household must sign and stamp it. If the handwriting is found to be blurred and unclear, the public sales offices will refuse to sell it. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Order from the Ministry of Justice to Emphasize Investigation Cases; The Handling Officials Should Personally Attend the Investigation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice Administration believes that various courts often perfunctorily handle investigation cases, which is very wrong. In order to effectively rectify this situation, the Ministry, based on the resolutions of the National Judicial Administration Conference, stipulates that investigation cases should be handled by the handling judges themselves. In particular, in cases involving human lives, the handling personnel should be instructed to pay special attention to the investigation when attending the initial investigation, and must not be negligent, causing inconvenience.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Readers Scholarship Fund received generous donations from Tong Kee and Mr. Dong Deyang yesterday, which will be used for scholarships. In addition, the students of the 32nd grade of Xinzhong Middle School, putting themselves in others' shoes, transferred the surplus funds of the grade's scholarship to the Shen Bao scholarship fund. All are extremely valuable. I would like to thank the poor students on their behalf.</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarships received yesterday were: Tong Kee, 4,000 yuan; Dong Deyang, 2,000 yuan (as a celebration gift from relatives and friends for his son's full month, and 310 yuan supplemented by himself, the list of titles is as follows: Ren Shouyu, Chen Zhiqing, Wu Yuncheng, Zhang Xinzhi, Qiu Zhuru, Mrs. Qiu, Shao Qianli, Wu Xianming, Xu Gaoming, Tao Junfei, 100 yuan each; Wu Xianwei, Wang Qiusheng, Xu Xingwei, Zhou Zhuan, Zhou Zhuping, Song Shengchuang, Ma Hongzhang, Yao Qiaosheng, 46.25 yuan each; Chen Yongfu, Sun Jingqian, Zhang Guichang, Hua Dafu, Hong Haiguan, Sun Yingru, Chen Guangfu, Yan Guikang, 40 yuan each; 316 yuan from the 32nd grade of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School, 12 yuan from Ding Fa, totaling 6,338 yuan in savings certificates, and the balance is 313,284.69 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Tram Company Streamlines Ticketing and Hopes for Passenger Cooperation <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Tram Company Bureau, due to recent revenue issues and the fact that the vehicles are crowded in the morning and evening, which can easily lead to dangerous incidents, in order to streamline the company's administration and effectively cooperate with passengers, passengers are encouraged to report rude ticket sellers to the authorities for severe punishment. Yesterday, the Tram Company Bureau also notified all sectors of society that they must obtain tickets of the same value from the ticket sellers when taking the tram. The notice said: "Attention, tram passengers, it is a public principle to pay for a ticket for transportation. However, some passengers only know to pay the fare and do not ask for a ticket. This is not only abandoning their rights, but also losing their personal dignity. If the ticket inspector finds a passenger without a ticket, they must buy a ticket again according to the rules. This is not worth sitting on a tram once and paying twice. If a nosy person sees it, they will think that the passenger deliberately did not buy a ticket and occupied the seat, which is inevitably ridiculed. Moreover, when you ask yourself, you will feel ashamed. Therefore, we especially advise the public that it is the most reasonable and glorious way to buy a ticket of equal value when boarding the bus and paying the fare. We sincerely hope that all passengers will pay special attention to avoid being deceived and to show fairness, which is our great hope."</p>
<h3 id="e43">Since the Start of the Epidemic Prevention Campaign, Thousands of People are Injected Every Day; The Validity Period of the Epidemic Prevention Certificate is Three Months; There is No Need to Fear Fever After Injection <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since the epidemic prevention injection has been widely implemented, the various health sub-bureaus and special injection points set up by the Baojia have been very crowded in recent days. The roadside injection teams set up by the health authorities at the intersection of each district also advise pedestrians to get injections.</p>
<p>Validity Period of the Epidemic Prevention Certificate. Since the start of the epidemic prevention injection campaign in this port, the total number of people injected every day has averaged several thousand. These people are given epidemic prevention certificates, which are valid for three months. However, it is said that this certificate is absolutely not allowed to be borrowed. If it is found, they will be fined.</p>
<p>No Need to Fear Fever After Injection. The anti-epidemic vaccines used in various hospitals are said to have been checked by the authorities and should not be dangerous in any way. Residents who are injected may develop a slight fever due to physical weakness. According to the explanation, this is not a major problem and there is no need to fear it. In any case, the authorities are determined to have every resident of Shanghai vaccinated against the epidemic this summer to thoroughly prevent the spread of cholera.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Measures in the French Concession. The health authorities of the French Concession said that there have been new improvements in the implementation of epidemic prevention measures in the French Concession this year. Now, various epidemic prevention measures have been decided to ensure that residents can enjoy these measures. For example, sufficient storage of sanitary materials has been prepared. The Pasteur Institute is currently able to supply 1 million CC of vaccine. In addition, a large number of injectors, assistants, and supervisors have begun work.</p>
<p>Compulsory Nature. This epidemic prevention injection is compulsory. Every resident must have an epidemic prevention injection certificate. As for the style of the certificate, it is completely uniform throughout China. A paper will be issued to each person at the time of injection for proof. The certificate states the ID number and is valid for three months, calculated from the date of injection.</p>
<p>Inspection Certificate. For special accommodation, certificates issued by doctors can be exchanged for official certificates, but they must be exchanged in person at the Health Department at 630 Avenue Beler within two days after the injection. The department will carefully check to avoid fraud. If it is found, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Number of Injections. If possible, epidemic prevention injections should be given twice, eight days apart, with 1 CC per injection. If it is not possible to give two injections, 2 CC can be given in one injection. The first injection plan for all residents in the French Concession will be completed in May. With the cooperation and inspection of the police station and Baojia authorities, it is believed that the epidemic prevention plan can be satisfactorily implemented.</p>
<p>Injection Location. The locations of the fixed epidemic prevention teams set up in each district are listed below:</p>
<p>Xiaodongmen District: 105 Yangxing Street.</p>
<p>Mailand District: Police Station.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre District: Baxianqiao Small Vegetable Market, Ximen Road Small Vegetable Market, Police Station, 630 Avenue Beler Health Department.</p>
<p>Central District: 99 Lane 78, Rue du Père Huc, 450 Avenue du Père Froc, entrance of Lane 304, Route Paul Henry.</p>
<p>Avenue Foch District: 840 Avenue des Soeurs Health Branch, Police Station, 201 Route Mercier.</p>
<p>Avenue Petain District: 241 Route Wendling, the International Savings Society Building at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson.</p>
<p>In addition, the Health Department at 620 Avenue Beler and the branch at 840 Avenue des Soeurs are working as usual, and typhoid injections are still being given in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Naval Garrison Area Baojia Office originally used military currency as the standard for the Baojia fees collected from each district. In order to comply with the authorities' policy, it has been decided that from the 1st of next month, the Central Reserve Bank notes will be used as the standard. The Baojia fees are set at 6 yuan per month for shops and factories, 3 yuan for landlords with two tenants, and 1 yuan for tenants with three tenants.</p>

<p>The Nanshi area has always been a prosperous commercial area. After the war, it suffered severely from the ravages of war. Traffic to and from the French Concession was suddenly cut off, and it was extremely inconvenient for pedestrians to enter and exit. Although the iron gates at Laobeimen and other places have been opened since then, the remaining iron gates have not been opened to the public, which has greatly hindered the restoration of Nanshi. It was once rumored that they would be opened to the public on the 1st of next month, but according to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, the saying that they would be opened to the public on May 1st will not be implemented at that time. However, the relevant authorities have both agreed to the principle of opening to the public.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Municipal Baojia Committee, in order to unify the Baojia funds in each district, it was decided to readjust them. The fees are 2 yuan per month for attached households, 4 yuan per month for regular households, and 6 yuan per month for shops. These measures have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is now learned that the committee has ordered its subordinate district offices and Baojia offices to universally levy the fees starting in April. All original levy methods in each district have been abolished, and each district has been ordered to quickly prepare a budget of income and expenditure for examination.</p>

<p>Previously, the military authorities, in order to prevent the spread of germs in the city, ordered the Guohua Coffin Transport Department to disperse the coffins left in Shanghai, and have successively dispersed up to 10,000 coffins. Now that the weather is warming, the Coffin Transport Department has accelerated the dispersal of coffins in accordance with the authorities' intention. The 42nd dispersal has been scheduled to be transported by the Xinningshao wheel on the 27th of this month. Therefore, all coffin owners in the city can quickly apply for registration at No. 2, Lane 96, East Jinmen Hotel, Jing'an Temple Road. Poor coffin owners have a method of extinguishing fees and can contact them.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Discussion on the Preservation of Wealth (1) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Preservation of Wealth by Elder Layman Nie Yuntai is broad, profound, and extremely perfect. It is truly a heart-wrenching article. Recently, he wrote "Report on Public Doctor and Medicine Relief by Xian Leshan," which is especially a good word for correcting the world. Yesterday, I respectfully listened to Mr. Zhang Yili's lecture on "Citizen Welfare" at the Jing'an Temple. The views are the same and I was very moved. Therefore, I would like to extend its meaning without fear of presumptuousness. I hope that the readers will teach me. - Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>What is wealth? Wealth means abundance and surplus. In the past, Yan Fu translated the book "The Wealth of Nations," which cited Western philosophical economic theories and did not refer to the wealth of one person or one family. The explanations of wealth by scholars from various countries are also inconsistent. Ordinary people only refer to tangible wealth, but they do not know that "wealth of talent and learning" and "wealth of compassion" are more important. The concept of wealth is created by individual psychology and social psychology. Whether it is ethical, religious, economic, or artistic, everything determines its value due to changes in demand and supply, and obtains its quantity in the estimation of social balance. Gold and silver coins are just bargaining chips for calculation. Poverty and wealth are comparative names. In wealthy countries, even if they are well-fed and clothed, they cannot be called officials. As in our country, which has been plagued by wars for years, and the people are not well-connected, it is exactly what the Father of the Nation called "only great poverty and small poverty." Even those who are called wealthy may not be truly wealthy.</p>
<p>What is the standard of wealth? Everyone has a selfish heart, and the concept of wealth is unbreakable. They believe that without being an official, without speculating, there is no way to get rich. Without wealth, there is no glory. Without glory, there is no power. This is a vulgar generalization. May I ask what is the standard of wealth? In this difficult time of life, the standard of wealth is also the most difficult to determine: (1) Is it based on money? Money is currency, and its value is constantly changing.</p>
<p>(2) Is it based on goods? In this time of material shortage, hoarding and speculating can indeed lead to great wealth, but it is not allowed by national laws. Moreover, excessive storage leads to theft, which the ancients warned against. Even if it is hidden and kept wealthy, if one does not know how to work diligently in production, then sitting idle and eating what is available is not reliable.</p>
<p>(3) Is it based on life and body? People in the world only recognize the body of flesh and blood as their own, wives and children as their family, gold, jade, and jewelry as their wealth, and greed, delusion, and delusion as their hearts. They take this body and mind as the standard and make plans for thousands of years, so they create all kinds of karma, busy and busy, troubled and troubled, all of which is suffering. They do not know that the body of flesh and blood is a tangible thing and changes are uncertain. Wives and children are family outside the body, and gathering and scattering are inappropriate. Gold, jade, and jewelry are rare treasures that others can steal. Greed, delusion, and delusion are the nature of ignorance, which is even more elusive. Putting it all together, birth and death are impermanent. If we observe the body based on physiology or anatomy and analyze it to the extreme, we will know that the body is not the true self. If we observe family members based on psychology, we will know that individuals exist independently. If we observe the spirit based on psychology, we will know that feelings and emotions are all nothing more than the effects of stimulation and response. Everything is not the true standard of wealth.</p>
<p>Who is rich? How can wealth be preserved? How many rich people have there been in ancient and modern times? Although they were prominent in their lifetime, they only ate three meals a day and slept on one bed. There was no happiness to speak of. Shi Chong's wealth was taken advantage of by slaves and he did not die well. Elephants are burned for their teeth, leopards are tattooed for their patterns. A common man is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing jade. How many people in troubled times have been brought disaster by wealth? Therefore, Lao Tzu said: "Gold and jade fill the hall, but no one can keep them. Being rich and noble is to leave behind faults. Holding and filling them is not as good as stopping." The ancients who became rich through diligence and thrift could still keep it. If it comes from theft and extravagance is admired, its ruin will be even faster. I remember Mr. Ma Yinliang talking about the problem of life in the Shen Bao, saying: "Preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy. Being wealthy with the masses can make oneself wealthy." These are indeed the best words that conform to scientific theory.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Economic Circles: Critique on Weights and Measures in the Price Problem <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Weights and Measures Investigation Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, in order to crack down on merchants using substandard weights and measures, recently dispatched officers to various districts of the city for thorough investigations. If anyone is found using substandard weights and measures, they will be dealt with according to the following methods: (1) Accusation in court according to criminal law; (2) Interrogation based on the land regulations; (3) Issuance of warnings; (4) Confiscation of the substandard weights and measures. According to a recent announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, Sun Yu-cai, the vendor of meat stall number 45 at the New Market, was fined 300 yuan and his scales were confiscated for using short weights. Furthermore, the city government yesterday received balances and other instruments from the pre-incident Weights and Measures Verification Bureau of the city for future use.</p>
<p>According to ancient history: "Hebrew and Indian civilizations both had regulations for punishing counterfeit weights and measures, and those who counterfeit weights and measures were considered to be committing the same crime as those who raised market prices for profit." Encountering the counterfeiting and use of substandard weights and measures are both criminal acts of raising prices.</p>
<p>In the Republic of China, during the 18th year, the government authorities, due to the numerous abuses in the system of weights and measures, formulated regulations for weights and measures, using the meter, kilogram, and liter as units, and also using the city foot, city catty, and city peck as parallel units. In the same year, a publicity campaign was held to promote the use of standard weights and measures. We believe that substandard weights and measures should be thoroughly cracked down on. Strict supervision should be imposed on the manufacture of weights and measures, and severe punishments should be imposed on merchants and civilians who use substandard weights and measures, so that our people will not be subjected to increased oppression due to rising prices.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Discusses Wartime Food Administration Countermeasures <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>After the National Government entered the war, recognizing the importance of food in wartime, the Provisional Commission was reorganized into the Ministry of Food, which is responsible for the production, management, and distribution of food throughout the country. Since its establishment, the Ministry has made many efforts in food administration. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry to inquire about (1) the fundamental countermeasures for the food problem during wartime, and (2) the general situation of production control, distribution, and consumption. The Vice Minister provided detailed answers, the main points of which are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  The fundamental countermeasures for the food problem during wartime are threefold: (A) To increase production to achieve abundant harvests and replenish storage; (B) To strengthen control to ensure supply and demand meet and prices are balanced; (C) To manage consumption to ensure rational allocation and equal enjoyment. These three aspects should be promoted simultaneously and not neglected. 2. As for</p>
<p>Plans to Increase Production, start with the most important materials for military and civilian food needs, such as (1) agricultural products, (2) aquatic products, and (3) livestock products. Various means such as experimentation, promotion, breeding, protection, and loans are used to increase production and improve technology. 3. In all provinces and cities, all food materials should be managed by food merchants, organized into</p>
<p>Trade Associations. Each trade association can be divided into four groups: (1) purchasing merchant group, (2) sales merchant group, (3) retail merchant group, and (4) manufacturing merchant group. Such organization will result in division of labor and cooperation, achieving greater effectiveness. The types of food industry trade associations currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food are listed as follows: 1. Coarse grains industry, 2. Flour industry, 3. Livestock industry, 4. Aquatic products industry, 5. Egg industry, 6. Edible oil industry, 7. Sugar industry, 8. Tea industry, 9. Canned food industry, 10. Brewing industry, 11. Seasoning industry, 12. Vegetable and fruit industry, 13. Other food and beverage industries commonly consumed in daily life. Among the food materials operated by the above industries, the Ministry of Food has presented to the Executive Yuan for approval to designate six major commodities as follows: (1) Coarse grains, (2) Flour, (3) Livestock, (4) Eggs, (5) Sugar, (6) Edible oil. The details will be announced soon. As for</p>
<p>Rice and Grain, whose nature is particularly important, it has always been under the direct management of the government. Before the promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the Articles of Association for Rice Joint Operation Cooperatives have been formulated, instructing rice merchants in counties and cities within the unified rice procurement area to start organizing joint operation cooperatives. All rice merchants must join; those who do not participate in the joint operation cooperatives may not engage in the rice business. All organizational content and spirit are exactly the same as other food industry trade associations. The differences are: (1) Rice joint operation cooperatives do not need to participate in the Shanghai Silk Federation, while other food major commodity trade associations must participate in the unified control federation; (2) Certificates and permits used by rice joint operation cooperatives are issued by the Ministry of Food, while other food major commodity trade associations may issue their own transportation permit certificates. 4. As for</p>
<p>Management of Consumption Methods, the most thorough way is to hold pin-mouth food distribution, so that everyone has food, and food has a fixed amount, not too much, no waste. All businesses that consume rice and grain, such as brewing and making pastries, should be cracked down on. In short, in today's wartime, the sole mission of the Ministry of Food is to increase production, strengthen management, in order to enrich military needs and stabilize civilian food, and with concerted efforts from top to bottom, the food problem can be hoped to be solved.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Ministry of Food Urges Organization of Food Associations in Various Places <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food considers trade associations in various places as the grassroots organizations of the National Federation of Commercial Control, as well as the basic components of the Shanghai Federation of Industries. It is imperative to organize and establish them in advance, so that they can be connected and mutually beneficial. Various commodities can also be moved and utilized systematically and orderly, exerting the spirit of self-governance and control of merchants, so that military and civilian food needs can be continuously supplied and there will be no more panic. The Food Bureau of each province and city has been ordered to promptly urge merchants operating food materials in the counties and cities under their jurisdiction to organize trade associations according to the following items and establish them within the time limit. The original methods are transcribed as follows: (1) Major food commodities, such as coarse grains, flour, livestock, eggs, sugar, and edible oil, have been divided into regions by the Ministry, and a group of preparation personnel has been appointed to start preparations. The local food departments should immediately provide guidance and supervision nearby, and organize and establish them all within this month. (2) For the various major commodities listed above, in districts where the Ministry has not appointed preparatory personnel, the local food department should immediately convene influential members of the industry to elect three or five representatives and submit them to the Ministry for appointment as preparatory personnel. At the same time, preparations should be started and organized according to law, and all establishments should be reported before May 5. (3) For other food products, the local food departments should, according to the types managed by the Ministry, and based on the newly promulgated regulations and in consideration of local customs, promptly urge the reorganization of the original associations, and all establishments should be completed before May 15 to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Amount of Cotton Textiles and Medicines Shipped Out of This Port Increased Sharply Last Month <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's office in Shanghai sent personnel on the 16th of last month to take over the material shipping office of the Japanese Embassy, the office was taken over by the National Federation of Commercial Control on the 18th of this month. During this month and two days, the situation of material shipping in and out of this port was as follows: Medicines, cotton textiles (including socks, towels, underwear, etc.), and hardware were the most shipped out materials, while rice and beans were the main shipped in materials. Among the shipped in and out materials, the total value of cotton products was over 7.82 million yuan, of which Chinese merchants shipped out over 3.57 million yuan, and Japanese merchants shipped out over 4.24 million yuan.</p>
<p>Observing these figures, it can be seen that the trade of Chinese merchants has gradually increased in the past month. The types and quantities of materials shipped in and out of this port in March are surveyed as follows:</p>
<p>Shipped out materials: Medicines 3,152,000 yuan, dyes 324,000 yuan, cotton textiles 7,822,000 yuan, matches 282,000 yuan, soap 229,000 yuan, kerosene 975,000 yuan, machinery 769,000 yuan, metal products 2,729,000 yuan, rubber products 235,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Regarding the organization of the Shanghai Egg Industry Trade Association, the Ministry of Food has ordered Shanghai egg merchant Zheng Yuanxing and others to be the preparatory personnel for the industry trade association, responsible for preparing and organizing. Recently, the Ministry of Food received a report that Dai Hongliang claimed to have organized an egg merchant joint operation cooperative according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. This should be a pretense or have other intentions, and Dong Zhikai, an assistant of the Management Department, has been ordered to go to investigate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Department announced: Regarding the matter of applying for permits from the Bureau for the transportation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it has been announced in Announcement No. 6327 on the 16th of this month. Now, the fees for these permits and the amount of security deposits to be paid by the applicants have been stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Permit fee: 5 yuan per piece, regardless of the quantity of cotton yarn or cotton cloth.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council of the National Government, levied a tax of 25% on alcohol based on its value. The prices of various types of alcohol were estimated, with Shaoxing wine at 400 yuan per load, imitation Shaoxing wine at 240 yuan per load, local yellow wine at 180 yuan per load, colored wine at 1,000 yuan per load, and local white liquor at 500 yuan per load. All alcohol guilds were ordered to instruct their members to comply with the tax payment. However, the Liang Shao Industry Guild believed that the estimated price of local white liquor was too high to comply with, so they requested assistance and changes from the competent authorities such as the Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and sent representatives to petition. The Taxation Department approved the order, instructing the industry guild to report the cost and selling price of the place of origin in detail to the department for investigation and verification before making a final decision. The industry guild has reported the facts and is awaiting verification.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Reader Forum: Thorough Solutions to the Price Problem (1) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Zhonghui</p>
<p>The "price problem" in Shanghai has become a national economic problem. After the war, most of the factories in the interior have been shut down, and all daily necessities must rely on Shanghai's exports. Therefore, the rise in prices in Shanghai directly affects the prices nationwide. Rising prices are equivalent to the invisible devaluation of banknotes. People throw out all the money they have and exchange it for useful items. This reveals a distrust of the currency. As a result of the entire society searching for materials, prices are further increased. The public's panic about prices can lead to the collapse of the currency system and the bankruptcy of the national economy. This vicious cycle of rising prices has three factors: First, the impact of material shortages; Second, the result of inflation; Third, the formation of market manipulation and hoarding.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily correct to consider the lack of materials as the cause, because materials during wartime are certainly not as abundant as during peacetime, and rising prices are an unavoidable phenomenon. However, rising prices due to this reason will be in the form of a gradual increase, because it is due to the gradual consumption of material reserves. The current jumping state of Shanghai's prices cannot be encompassed by the simple reason of material shortages. If inflation is considered the cause of rising prices, then it should also be gradual, not rapid and sudden. Moreover, with the increase in the area of the peaceful district, the increase in tax revenue, and the expansion of the circulation area of the Central Reserve Bank notes, it cannot be regarded as the main culprit causing rising prices. Therefore, speculative hoarding is actually the biggest main cause.</p>
<p>The government has the determination to eradicate hoarders, which is not only what the people are looking forward to, but also what friendly countries are paying attention to. However, the fact that we cannot completely break away from old habits is undeniable. The background of the so-called "big tigers" is causing much discussion in society, with clear details. For the sake of the survival of the entire nation, the government must urgently use its enormous political power and be willing to make the greatest sacrifices to thoroughly investigate in order to maintain the survival of the nation. The public generally believes that the "Thorough Investigation of Speculation Order" issued by the National Government on April 7 is "mere formalities." In order to eliminate such a public perception, the government should urgently promulgate "Provisional Emergency Regulations for Cracking Down on Speculation and Hoarding." It may be prosecuted for disturbing the state and executed by a military court. Now, to the best of my humble opinion, I propose the following three methods:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly investigate speculative hoarding: First, the reckless lending of the financial sector in the past, or the use of goods as collateral, has in fact resulted in inflation. Therefore, this soft hoarding is enough to stimulate rising prices. In the past two or three years, the establishment of Shanghai banks has been like bamboo shoots after rain. Investigating their predecessors, most of them were small money shops, and their business was only speculation or improper lending. If the existence of such banks is confirmed, they should be sealed up immediately, and their operators should be severely punished according to the severity of their crimes.</p>
<p>(2) Second, freezing warehouses is also the most effective method. For any goods in any warehouse, it is not allowed to be moved in or out. The purpose of the owner's inventory should be quickly investigated. If there is suspicion of hoarding, they should be arrested and the goods confiscated. (3) Third, investigate stores. Stores refusing to sell is a strange phenomenon in recent years. The hoarding of stores of all sizes in the city is also a cause of high prices, and it directly stimulates the public's panic. It is appropriate to task agencies such as the Commercial Control Association with investigating inventory and whether stores refuse to sell goods, and to allow the public to secretly report. In the event of the above situation, in addition to closing the store, the store owner, guarantor, and association负责人 should all be handed over to the court for severe punishment. (4) Fourth, task the section chiefs of each district with investigating and reporting hoarders in their jurisdiction within a time limit. If there are rental houses for hoarding or speculation, they should be dealt with according to the law. If the section chiefs conceal and fail to report, they should be punished for the same crime. (5) Fifth, reward the public for secretly reporting. (6) Sixth, organize secret investigation teams to randomly check stores and hoarders reported by the people. - The implementation of the above six investigation methods still needs to be studied for its steps and detailed methods. In short, it should not exceed the principle of political means.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Three Metaphors of Life <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xin</p>
<p>There are three metaphors for life:</p>
<p>The first metaphor is the ocean: the ocean has times of calm and tranquility, and times of stormy waves. In calm times, the so-called vastness of the sea and sky, sailboats, distant mountains, and seagulls, adorn a beautiful seascape. In stormy waves, however, the sky is dark and the earth is dark, and strong winds, heavy rain, and thick fog envelop the entire universe. However, it is necessary to have stormy waves to know how rare the calm and tranquility is. If it is always calm and tranquil, it may make people feel tired of seeing it, and feel ordinary and monotonous! At the same time, in the roaring waves, the sea will make a roaring sound that shakes the earth, and stir up active silvery white waves, which shows the sea's majesty and greatness.</p>
<p>The second metaphor is the river: the river carries a clean quality, flowing continuously and peacefully, calmly and steadily, only advancing, not retreating. The mountains cannot stop it, the rocky mountains cannot resist it, and the wind cannot turn it around. Finally, one day, it reaches its destination - the ocean.</p>
<p>The third metaphor is the pond: the pond carries an old quality, permanently stagnant. The occasional movement by wind and rain is only a thin layer on the surface. Its entirety will never move forward one step, so the inside is only turbid and dirty, and microorganisms also take advantage of it to reside, causing it to become rotten.</p>
<p>The first kind of life is the most valuable, the second kind of life is the most vigorous, and the third kind of life is the most unpromising.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Profit <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>The world is bustling, all for "profit"; the world is noisy, all for "profit."</p>
<p>"Profit" itself has no good or evil. Legal "profit" is even stipulated by law, and there is nothing to criticize.</p>
<p>However, Mencius, at the beginning of his book, strongly criticized the evils of loving "profit." Where "profit" lies, the masses flock like ducks. Seeing "profit" and forgetting righteousness, what care is given to faith; seeking "profit" and betraying virtue, what consideration is given to benevolence. Therefore, there is no righteousness, no faith, no virtue, no benevolence, hypocrisy, cunning, mutual deception, what the eyes see is "profit"; what the ears hear is "profit"; what the feet walk is for "profit"; what the hands move is for "profit"; what the mind thinks is nothing but "profit." Hoarding, accumulating, monopolizing, blackmailing, exploiting, creating rumors and causing trouble, stirring up trouble, only to seek one's own "profit," regardless of the hunger and cold of tens of thousands of people!</p>
<p>The ancient saying goes, "Silver is white and gold is yellow, the eyes see the heart turn black." Today's banknotes, however, are colorful, and the heart flutters when you see them. Once the desire for "profit" overwhelms the mind, "profit" also makes the mind lose its way. Therefore, unscrupulous means are used, and no consideration is given to morality.</p>
<p>If the path of material desire is not blocked, how can the door of morality be opened? As Plato said, "Material needs are the evil obstacles that hinder the soul's ascent," and the original culprit is intoxicated in the path of "profit" and loses direction.</p>
<h3 id="e65">True and False <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Lin</p>
<p>If a midget is standing on the tip of a pyramid, can you say he is higher than the pyramid? No, he will still be called a midget! But there are so many fools in the world. It is impossible for ten people to escape hiding their vices. Because if you walk with the sun on your back, your shadow is always in front of you, unless you walk facing the sun, and your shadow will be behind you.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether in life or in career, we should "seek the true, not the false, and be realistic in everything." You should know that our daily character, thoughts, life, ... are already known to others. Even if we can cover up stains for a while, they will eventually be revealed sooner or later. When each stain enters our heart, it leaves a deep mark on our character that cannot be erased for a lifetime. It was his disciple Judas who betrayed Jesus. Although he didn't know it at first, as soon as he managed a purse of thirty dollars, he immediately revealed his treacherousness in selling his master. Later, he was hanged, but he could not atone for his sins.</p>
<p>Hartland said, "Character is a person's inner self, and reputation is a person's appearance." It is absolutely true. One act leads to one consequence. There is absolutely no falsehood, only absolute truth.</p>
<p>In the afternoon chapel, people often piously pray, "Even if the treasures of the whole world were given to me, I would not covet them, because we have a pure heart, which is the greatest wealth." But when they are donating, they are groping for the lowest value banknotes... Is there still a need to deny it? Truth and falsehood are immediately revealed.</p>
<p>Whether it is "true" or "false," it cannot deceive others, nor can it deceive oneself.</p>

<p>— Le Ming</p>
<p>A passage from Mr. Gu Zhengshu's speech "The Struggle Between Life and Death" at the Youth Association</p>
<p>Every person has one birth and one death. No matter how much he loves life, he cannot live forever; no matter how afraid he is of death, he cannot avoid death.</p>
<p>Some people shock their neighbors when they are born, but die without a trace. Some people are unknown when they are born, but revered by thousands when they die.</p>
<p>A person's view of life and death can determine his attitude and way of life. One person feels that life is only a few decades, passing in the blink of an eye, so why work so hard? Another person believes that although life is inevitable to die, but "Heaven gives me talent, there must be a use." Since the Creator has created me, I must live a good life.</p>
<p>Look, people in today's society are either "living in a drunken dream" or "greedy for life and afraid of death," either "half-dead" or "not alive or dead." They euphemistically call it "prudent self-preservation." In my opinion, these (people) are really "although alive, they are already dead," or simply "it is better to be dead than alive"!</p>
<p>Life is loved by everyone, and death is hated by everyone. However, on the path of life and death, there are no clear signs for us to identify. Some paths we think are dead ends but are actually paths to life. Some paths we think are paths to life but are actually paths to death!</p>
<p>Life is surrounded by death, and death is also full of life. Friends, be careful of your steps! Don't only see death and not see life, and don't only see life and not see death!</p>
<h3 id="e67">Dissatisfaction and Lack of Contentment <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>One desire follows another, and young people will never feel satisfied. This feeling of dissatisfaction is the driving force for continuous human progress. The wheels of the world's advancement are driven by the feeling of dissatisfaction, and all the improvements in human life are also caused by the feeling of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>However, every feeling of dissatisfaction must have its social roots in reality. Society is not composed of just you. When you feel dissatisfied with a certain aspect, you can imagine that a larger group of people also have the same feeling. Therefore, when you satisfy your desires, you should carefully consider your means. Selfishly seizing the only thing others have to fill your own insatiable desires, then you should be cursed by the world. And you have also sullied the good human feeling of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>You do not have the intelligence to satisfy your desires, and you do not understand the social roots of why your desires cannot be satisfied. You blindly and selfishly seize the possessions of others to satisfy yourself, then you become a rude and vile person who lacks contentment. Lack of contentment is the opposite of dissatisfaction. It is despised by people because it often causes you to disregard the interests of others, disrupt society, and at the same time fall into sin and injustice and be cursed by society.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction is worthy of praise, while lack of contentment should be cursed; conversely, a state of contentment is what we should not want, and contentment is the virtue that we should take.</p>
<p>We should have a psychology of contentment for a temporary enjoyment in one's life. We should have an attitude of never being satisfied with our knowledge and intelligence; only in this way can we have something to rely on, gradually enriching our means of improving the environment, gradually understanding and eradicating the social roots that make us feel dissatisfied, and thus seeking to satisfy all our spiritual dissatisfactions, and even all our material dissatisfactions.</p>

<p>— Yuan Jie</p>
<p>Mencius said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it always first frustrates their heart and will, exhausts their muscles and bones, starves their body, impoverishes them, and disrupts their endeavors..." This passage needs much revision.</p>
<p>"Heaven"! "God"! These kinds of things are very vague. Saying that the fate of humanity is determined by the will of vague things is hard to believe. It would be better to say, "Some people who suffer and are tempered can shoulder great responsibilities." That would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>But this is not to say that all who suffer can shoulder great responsibilities. Some who are fortunate enough to survive their suffering become numb! Or indulge in pleasure! And the more they indulge, the more they suffer, eventually falling into an inextricable quagmire, struggling throughout their lives, ultimately unable to avoid destruction.</p>
<p>Nor is it to say that those who can shoulder great responsibilities must have suffered. As long as they receive a good education, why must they suffer? To this day, the center of culture is still the petty bourgeoisie. Only the petty bourgeoisie is most likely to have the time and energy to study science and art, and to do cultural work.</p>
<p>It is to say that some people, although they suffer (or have suffered), can still transcend mediocrity, shoulder great responsibilities, and achieve great things.</p>
<p>This is because, although they suffer, they still have considerable opportunities for development. They must have the opportunity to receive a good education. On one hand, they grit their teeth and live a hard, arduous, and extraordinary life; on the other hand, their lives have something to rely on. They are not bewildered, not depressed, and not like a bereaved person. With a strong interest, they work hard towards a self-determined and firm goal. And they have a devout and sincere faith in the great and beautiful things, and in the progress of their own efforts.</p>
<p>Gorky did hard labor, but three or four friends trained him to have a habit of only reading books, replacing all other entertainment in his spare time. At the age of nineteen, he once felt depressed and attempted suicide, but he was rescued. Later, a friend forced him to write, and since then, he escaped the life of hard labor.</p>
<p>Einstein studied mathematics with all his might in his youth. Apart from mathematics and physics, his other subjects were a mess (but he later dabbled in philosophy, biology, and literature). Later, his family went bankrupt, and he had no choice but to go to Switzerland, receiving a monthly allowance of one hundred francs, using eighty francs for living expenses. Although his nutrition was insufficient, he was fortunately able to devote all his time to studying at the university.</p>
<p>Faraday (the founder of electricity) was a bookbinding apprentice in his childhood. The boss agreed to him reading books in the shop. Later, with the help of his brother, he went to the Royal Academy every week to listen to lectures, taking complete notes. Later, he recommended himself to the academy as a servant and assistant, and was able to devote his life to science.</p>
<p>These great men who struggled out of suffering, although they suffered, still had considerable opportunities for development. Their scope of freedom was small. Precisely because it was small, they were cautious and did not dare to be distracted and dabble in various enjoyments. They were able to concentrate wholeheartedly on their work within their scope of freedom, without any distractions. The environment forced them to get rid of the constraints outside their scope of freedom and grasp the highly developed work within their scope of freedom. Their spirits could sometimes obtain the joy that others could not obtain, even ecstasy. Their self-education was extremely good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of them suffered too much! Einstein suffered from poor nutrition in his youth and later suffered from stomach problems. Gorky suffered from severe frostbite in his youth, which aggravated his lung disease, and eventually died of lung disease. Is this the suffering that is necessary for creation? This is such a regrettable thing!</p>
<p>Although material affluence is not necessarily a "good and beautiful environment," if they have not received a good education, some people will become playboys, spoiled brats, high-class hooligans, and living treasures! But scholars who struggle out of difficult environments, escaping death and finding life, already possess a tenacious quality. They can devote themselves to improving the environment, and they most need an environment suitable for fully studying knowledge. Material hardship should be rejected. They need to have their families' food, clothing, and housing fully guaranteed, without having to worry about it at all. They need a peaceful and tranquil environment to study knowledge. Who says that a few toothpicks and a few glass tubes can replace a fully equipped laboratory?</p>
<p>In short: The quality of the environment depends on both economics and education, with economics as the foundation.</p>

<h3 id="e70">An Earnest Appeal from a Mother: Willing to Nurture Her Family with the Proceeds of Labor <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>We recently received a letter from Ms. He, stating that her husband is disabled and does not produce, and her children are young and receiving education. The family has no fixed property, and life is difficult. She plans to earn a living through labor. Ms. He is educated and wrote the letter herself, with sincere words and emotions. It is especially commendable that she stated that she refuses all material assistance. Therefore, we will transcribe the original letter, hoping that sympathetic people in society will help find a way. This office can help notify. The original letter is as follows: "I am forty-two years old this year, have received education, and have three children, the eldest son is ten years old, the second daughter is nine years old, and the youngest daughter is eight years old. They are currently studying in the fifth, fourth, and first grades of elementary school, respectively. My husband is also an intellectual, but unfortunately became mentally disabled four years ago. Not only is he unable to produce or labor, but he also needs to spend a lot of money on medicine at any time. My family's finances were already stretched before the war, and we have no fixed property. In this狂潮 of soaring material prices, we have fallen into an unimaginable situation. Regarding节流, I have been personally operating for several years, reducing the necessities of daily life to below the level, insufficient nutrition and excessive fatigue, so I often develop morbid states, I have no way, I have to work hard. However, for a family of five, no matter how you save on medical education, the minimum is still about 1,000 yuan per month to maintain,竭力starting from the开源方面. Years of effort鬭, want to operate a small store to solve the problem of life, from July last year to the present,踏破铁鞋, the location is difficult to find, the large transfer fee is too large, the small one does not rent without friendship, as for other businesses, although there have been several plans, implementation, no achievement. One of the most difficult things is family operation, which takes up most of the time. If someone is hired as an agent, there will be one more person to spend. Originally, there are many kinds of jobs that are suitable for me, but no one introduces them, and the biggest main problem is whether the income of such jobs can meet the needs of my life burden. The environment is getting worse and worse, some people advised me to send a few children into charitable shelters, but I think I still have a strong body and a healthy brain, I should use my own labor to make my children survive, and give him and her the opportunity to continue to learn. Before my life ends, why increase the burden on society! Statistics currently all even clothing utensils priced, but 2,000 yuan, if still no way to develop, at most maintain two months, follow看 my several children's lives, followed by the capital decreased day by day ah! I'm really going crazy? I have decided to make persistent efforts, using this small amount of thousands of yuan of capital, plus all my labor, to make a final struggle, but I have been exhausted智尽能索, for this life of funds, must not blindly bet孤注一掷, I think there is no lack of sympathy for a mother in society, for her children垂死的 call. My hope is to guide me to an effective way of making profits? If there is a need to inquire about my environment and skills, you can also make a statement in person. No matter how difficult and繁重 the work is, I am willing. But refuse all material assistance."</p>
