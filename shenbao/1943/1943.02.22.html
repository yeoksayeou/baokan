<h3>加強統制物價的要領</h3>
<p>春節以後，本市物價，又以謠諑及黑市的作用，呈現空前高潮，工部局乃開始嚴格的統制。但目上週末以來，物價波動愈劇，市塲愈呈混亂，蒿自時艱，我們自不能不再向當局敬獻忠藎，或　對於今後本市商塲情况，不無補益。而且，本市仍爲和平區經濟中心，若本市物價問題獲謀合理與美滿之解決，則對於全國之影響極大，戰時經濟政策綱領，可望因而順利推行，而戰時國民生活之安定，亦即國家之利，東亞之福。</p>
<p>當局依據原則，採取必要步驟，以統制物價，穩定物價，爲現時所必要。但是在我們當前艱困的環境中，種種機構條件不够，各方面的根本平價措施尚不易切實增進，不免引起一般人對於當前限價的實施，發生若干疑慮。如生產萎縮，物資逃避，或來源减少，黑市潛行，或市塲混亂與蕭條等，都是爲一般人所不能釋然於懷，而必須謀求合理解決之道。根據各地紛歧的平價與局部管制少數物價的失敗經騐，理論上固當實施全面的各地區一致的遍及各種物品的限價，保持物品價格類別間與地域間的適當平衡，才能使限價政策澈底實施。但以物品種類之多，價格之繁，在我們今日環境與種種機構條件不够的情况之下，自然還不容易辦到，所以首先選擇幾種主要品，在各區重要市塲一致實施限價，特別是從本市開始以爲全國模範，也不能說不恰當。</p>
<p>這裏首先發生的問題，是選擇限價類別方面，就一般情形言，自應特別注意民生重要必需品，如糧·鹽·食油·棉花·棉紗·布疋·燃料·紙張八類，及運價與工資等項，於統一限價物品項目之中，兼寓安定物品成本與因地制宜之意。不過，我們要從各類中選擇其普遍消費的主要品目，或流動性較大的品目，並規定各地必須一致實行限價，使各該項物品在各地實施限價，容易取得地域間適當的聯系，而發揮領導各地物價安定的效用。其次，各種物價，如果地域間相差太大，未能取得相當的聯系，則低價區域，物資自會向高價地域逃避，而妨碍低價區域限價的實行。在今日交通運輪情況之下，物價區域間波動影響似乎不大，但各鄰近市場常為物資逃避與黑市盛行的場所。因之，應首先安定各地重要都市的物價，進而選得安定其鄰近的重要中小市塲，或經濟關係較切的市塲的物價，以確保各地區物價之穩定。我們應以各地重要都市爲中心，依各地交通與市塲組織狀况，劃定其鄰近的重要中小市塲或經濟關係較切的市塲，爲同屬的限價區域。這樣，一方面控制全面幾種少數主要物價，以領導各地一般物價，比較容易配合實施。另一方面適應各地區特殊情况，分區逐漸控制各種物價，也容易有效實行。</p>
<p>實施限價，關於如何選擇限價的標準與決定限價，也是值得深加考慮的一個重要問題。幾年來物價上漲，一方面是貨品成本增高，不得不增漲；另方面是供不應求，操縱居奇，促使物價猛漲暴漲。限價政策自然是可以允許前者存在，而遏止後者的漲風，也就是說限定物品價格，須以成本爲標準。不過，各地物價以種種關係，巳　於參差錯亂的情况，同一物品，不僅地域間的價格往往相差懸殊，即在同一地同一時期的價格也有極大的差度：同時各種貨品的成本構成的因素繁簡小同，其價格又互有連鎖關係，也不易精確估計其眞實的成本。過去限價都以某一定日期　物品各市塲的原有價格爲標準，自然是爲避免此種繁難問題，遏止當前物價漲風的一種斷然處置，不過，這一天某種物價在某市塲比較的低，　限定此棟低價，自然不易實行。如果另一種物價經過一度暴漲後又特別高，則允許此種高價的存在，自易妨礙其他限價的實行。所以還要斟酌實况，加以適當的調整，使過高者抑低若于，對過低者酌予提高，同時參照各該物品的主要因素的價格，估計其成本，可以粗定一種客觀的標準。其爲本地產品者，須要調查限價物品，在實施限價前半年間，各該項產品的主要成本因素在穩定時的價格，估計其產製成本，酌加利潤，規定其產價或產地批發價格。其爲外來產品者，則依照貨品主要產地，或來源地，在實施限價前半年間穩定時期的批發價格，加上運輸成本，確定其進貨成本，酌加利潤，規定其批發價格，即依照此種批發價格，或零售商淮貨成本，酌加利潤而規定。不過，批發零售，利潤，應以不超過貨品成本百分之二十爲標準。其次，各種貨物同時同地，一般說自不應有差別價格。同種貨品、有不同的來源，成本各異，爲顧及貨品成本，鼓勵生產來源計，似須以貨品實際成本或成本較高者，爲規定最高限價的標準。在最高限價以下，可以自由交易，這雖然對於成本較低的貨品價格，不免有提高的流弊，不過可以另用一種限制利潤的方式限制之；也可因各地市塲交易塲所區位的不同，分別在最高限價下，規定其普通交易價格，以適應各交易市塲的需要。所以在最高限價以下的差別價格，是可以存在的。至於政府物資機關徵購收購物資所核定的價格，及公營事業機關產品的價格，因爲經營性質以及作用與一般不同，或是大規模經營不計利潤，或具有若干獨占性質，或爲供應軍事需要，或爲調劑市塲供需，可不必與一般商銷物品限價一致。但原則上應比此項限價爲低，他們也可以因某特殊情形，或鼓勵貨品生產來源，需要規定貨品的最低限價。由於以上種種事實，則各地市塲同種貨品的差別價格，似仍可同時存在，便爲限價政策下一種伸縮性的運用方式。</p>
<p>以上所獻議的，不外爲漸進方式的限價政策，其重要特點，在使各地各種物價逐漸趨於適當的平衡，與地域間逐漸取得相當的聯系，規定限價趨於合理，俾我農工商企業各界心悅誠服，在相當管制情况之下，澈底實施限價政策。目前工部局當局對於物價政策，鑒於過去經騐，不得不採取斷然的處置，迅速的實施限價，這其間當然有若干人要遭受相當的損失，實施中也不免遭遇若干阻力。但是最重要的，我們還望當局對於執行方式上力謀改善，一方面務須廣泛的進行限價政策的官傳解釋工作，使各界了解限價政策之　意，减少一切阻力。並進行鼓勵民間各界的協助推行。另一方面務須儘力避免增加市塲的混亂情形，儘可能的减少正當的工商界的損失和不便。即如拘捕罰款等等，一定要完全依據法律，才能增加民間的了解與擁護。非常時期，我們誠然不能不有非常手段，然而非常手段，也　不能不依據非常時期的法律。在法律之前，沒有人可以營私舞弊，沒有人可以逃避責任，只有這樣，才能貫澈限價政策，而獲得美滿的成效。</p>

<h3>德蘇戰爭新局面　德國參謀本部變更戰略</h3>
<p>德軍卒又退出羅斯多夫，伏洛　洛夫兩城。以出產生鐵，煤斤著名之工業區唐納資盆地，亦被蘇軍克復，戰綫重又擴至烏克蘭平原。德軍果將隨時採用「有計劃之撤退」方針，而準備其春季攻勢乎？關於此事，頃據東京方面　得柏林之專電，剖析頗詳。</p>
<p>德軍有計劃撤退</p>
<p>旣稱有計劃之撤退，當有一定之限度。其限度若何，試一展烏克蘭之地圖，一望即知。在遼闊之重冰凍結的平原上，決非人工構築之陣地所能阻止敵方大軍，以遝輸不便之戰塲，除利用天險堅守以外，別無他法可阻大隊敵軍。屢戰皆勝之德軍，未免忽於此點。但德軍能征慣戰，並不因此失算而全面崩潰，安然波過高加索，頓河流域，擬後退至烏克蘭，此種戰略，足見爲有計劃之撤退，決非盲目舉動，實係以　當爲　旨之德軍傳統戰略。</p>
<p>德軍之人力資源</p>
<p>慣過溫暖　候之西歐將士，身臨零下二十度之寒帶，頓有四肢麻木　感。但敵方機械化。隊則身禦冬裝，慣於冬季生活，此種塲合，德軍如屬虛名戀棧，至死不離而繼續抵抗，雖不利於史太林城，或可制東戰塲於死地。但德軍精銳亦難免全軍覆滅。形勢如此嚴重，大敵當前，未來之荊棘必多。德國參謀本部有鑒於此，並爲顧全祖　之人力資源起見，雖一兵一卒之生命，不得不加以顧用，寗忍一時之恥辱，以求未來之榮譽，遂下決心撤退。</p>
<p>德國參　本部，　已從多方新角度開始檢討如何方能能戰勝蘇俄，德蘇戰爭現已進入新階段，設德國參謀本部仍用過去之舊思想作戰，　仍不免爲得而復失，失而復得之老套戰略，結果兩敗俱傷。若果如此，正中英國下懷，德軍領袖亦深知此情。於此尚有堪注意者，即目下蘇軍之攻勢，乃所謂「飢餓攻勢」，傾其最後之力量，希圖置之死地而後生。</p>
<p>在未來之攻勢中，德軍有何新戰術出現，任何軍人或專家均絨口不言，即平素信口雌簧之外行戰術家亦不敢發　意見，後方之鎭靜沉默，足見德人深信祖國軍隊，絕不疑慮。</p>
<p>對紅軍實力之錯估</p>
<p>軍事記者方面亦有反省，自知錯估蘇軍實力，致有此結果。當初原認爲冬季以堅守爲妙，但恐此計亦有錯誤。蘇聯之戰塲龐大，爭奪其固定土地之戰鬬當爲愚策，若不摧毀敵方兵力與軍火，不能謂係戰爭，是以今次德軍之第三次攻勢，將一改去年度以土地爲目標之戰略，必傾全力注重於摧毀敵方之戰鬬力，從　項見解而論，則此次之撤退，乃欲縮短戰綫之　徑距離　誘敵深入烏克蘭平原，蓋烏克蘭爲利於德軍作戰之戰塲，俾待氣候溫暖而用閃電殲滅戰攻破蘇軍。戈林元帥系之國家主義報主筆許貝林（譯音）氏，會用其慷慨激昂之筆調著文評述德國新攻勢，茲介紹其槪略如次：</p>
<p>量較質重</p>
<p>去年德軍之夏季攻勢，及目前蘇軍之冬季攻勢，均爲給予吾人之重大敎訓。蘇聯在東戰塲，不僅戰術優秀，武器精良，且不僅爲質的問題，而側重於量，傾　不勝數計之大量軍隊，大量　器，左右戰爭之歸趨。敵方以暴力手段而來，故我方亦唯有以暴力手段　向，方能　倒敵人，國家總動員之目標，亦即在此。目下吾人爲備未來之攻勢，故在調集較史太林更多之軍隊，較敵方更多之武器。然後可達最後勝利。（鵬：譯自二月二十一日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>歌樂山上</h3>
<p>— 卓芬</p>
<p>房屋荒和僱傭難</p>
<p>重慶郊外　歌樂山，在峯巒　翠的叢林中，天天在建築新的洋房。但渝市陸續不斷的搬來了富賈和貴人們的眷屬，山上的房子已住滿了。租房子有如登天之難，請女傭也感到棘手，於是競爭的現象發生了，誰敢出高價誰就容易請到傭人，最苦的是那些固定收入的人們。錢，每月只有一定的數目，但物價却像老鷹一般地飛在天上。用人就請不起了。我有一位朋友，他們夫妻同在一個機關做事，每月九百多元的收入，要吃飯，要應酬，要零用，還要請用人，在七折八扣中，每月只能出六七十元的工價，這一次我看到他們實在頭痛，一個女傭請來不到幾大，要求增加工資，常拿別人來比較說：「山上王太太家只有四口，請個大娘，每月的工資是一百五十元，還有外務錢，打脾的小費，到親友家送禮的小費，一個月還可撈百把塊錢。楊公館的潘嫂，每天僅是送楊太太兩個孩子上學，放學時領他回來，洗洗衣服，也不用燒飯，這樣輕做的事，每月就有一百二十元的收入。」這樣，我常常看見我的朋友爲着請傭人而發愁。用人走了，太太只得請假在家　自己燒飯帶小孩</p>
<p>買不到猪肉</p>
<p>一個星期必須六天吃素菜的小公務人員和小學敎師的家庭，在禮拜天，他們也　吃葷，嘗點肉味，或隨便請個把客。爲了這件事，就得犧牲二點鐘甜蜜的晨睡，在星光將消失的時間，投身在山野間的薄霧輕紗裏，朝着高店子跑。不但歌樂山附近的住家如此，就是遠在和尚坡的人們亦常常要走這段路。</p>
<p>肉市塲上，掛在肉旁微弱的燈光尚搖幌不定，市門前已湧上一條人流，擁擠着，爭搶着，不論肥的瘦的只要買到手，就很得意很傲然的昂揚走了。有時買者因賣者不公平而大嗓一塲。要是你只能買一斤或半斤肉的話，站半天也休想買到　，只對着那一堆已被高貨的顧客們定好的肉嘆息。狡猾而獲利的屠戶，只看重買多的，他們做的是皇帝生意，對着買肉少的顧客露着鄙視的神氣</p>
<p>沒得肉了，這是人們定好了的肉，動它幹什麼？」嘴裏喊着買一斤肉半斤肉的顧客，摸着鈎上一大塊肉有點兩捨不得放手。</p>
<p>唉！禮拜天該多殺幾個猪的，白跑一趟，一片肥肉都買不到，眞是倒霉一二聲微弱的嘆息，消失在散落下去的人流中。</p>
<p>房東的精算盤</p>
<p>房東的算盤打得眞好，房子已出賣成功了。照道所西式房子的外觀看，年歲已經不少，天花板剝落了許多空洞，牆壁也裂開幾處；壁洞裏成爲耗子的住家，廚房更是雨漏不堪，窗子破得關不攏。房東太太常常對我們說，木匠不易找到啦，使屋子沒有好好修補。其實，木匠泥水匠都可以叫到，問題是在於他們準備把房子出賣，是　了省錢。</p>
<p>五年前買這所屋子，他們只花七百元，現在出賣了二萬元，除了自己住的三間房子不花錢之外，還出租了側面的廂房。以前的房租或計少一點，</p>
<p>一年一千元是可拿到手的。房東現在一點差　却不幹，拿了這二萬元，也可過活了。（三十一年十二月廿日寄）</p>

<p>南洋各地特輯之三</p>
<h3>菲律賓的今昔　（四）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>（五）菲島獨立的根本障碍：由於農業中的封建殘遺勢力之存在—這是西班牙帶來的三百多年來毒害菲人的制度，由於農民的窮乏和民度（人民文明貧富程度）的低下　農耕技術的拙劣，又由於民族資本的貧乏，這許多經濟上的原因，形成菲島獨立的主要障碍。美國統治菲島，就在加强這種障碍。例如對美輸出品的分配制，累進課稅制，一美元合二比索的幣價制等，都加深了菲島農業生產力的不正常發展，農業勞慟之生產性的低下，生產成本高，加以一美元合二比索的通貨制，造成菲島商品的高價，除了更加依靠美國，使難在別國市塲競爭。於是，除了美國投資家與菲島極少數的農業家以外，最大多數人便被束縛在與民族發展無關的生產上。同時，不能忽視的是輸出農業的投資，都在外人手中，外資壟斷了輸出利潤，菲島資本家本身以農產輸出所得，購入高價的美國商品，結果，民族資本的積蓄不足，而商業部門，則一向在華僑及其他外人手中，商業資本也不能轉人工業資本而發展菲島的國民經濟。</p>
<p>（六）幼稚的工業：最足以顯示菲島經濟之落後性的是工業的未成熟，近代工業（生產性生產部門）的缺乏。菲島工業不過是製糖椰子油·製繩·水泥·製帽·酒精業·鈕扣及刺繡業·農產品的加工業；還停滯在家庭工業階段。例如製糖工業中，壓榨塲四十六，而精製工塲只有四家；砂糖輸出額中精製糖只佔百分之五；而烟草業，亦以手工業爲主，紙烟反須從美國輸入。紡織工業方面又因依存美棉的關係而不能發展。驚人的高利貸，也成爲阻滯工業發展的因素，近年菲列賓政府曾在謀經濟獨立的要求之下，力謀推進工業化運動，可是，由於歐戰和美國在太平洋上的積極備戰而受利挫折。</p>
<p>（七）外資支配之鑛業：菲島主要產業而爲今後復興要素是鑛業。過去也在美國隸屬之下，百分之八十受外國資本支配，開發最力的金鑛。總投貧額一億二千萬比索中，百分之三十五屬於美系，百分之二十五屬英系，白分之一七·五屬西班牙系所支配。金，鐵，銅，錳，鉻等器各種鑛藏，都在未開發狀態中。但埋藏鑛產，除上述外，還有銀，錫，鉛，亞鉛，煤等，非鐵金屬則有鹽，石油，石灰，石綿，大理石，，石膏，鳥糞石等。據一九四二年一月二十四日日本政府公布菲島主要鑛產資源爲（一）鐵鑛石，一九三九年輸出七十萬一千噸，其大部份輸日，埋藏量極豐富，（二）鉻鑛，一九二九年輸出十萬二千噸，其中五萬四千噸輸美，埋藏量一千萬噸。稱世界第一。（三）銅鑛，埋藏量的五百萬噸。（四）錳，一九三八年輸出四萬九千噸，大部份輸日。</p>
<p>菲島鑛業與農業不同，對美依存性不大，過去對日關係較爲密切，今後發展也較容易。擄一三九九年數字，鐵鑛三九九％，銅鑛五九九％，精銅五六三％，銘的一〇％，錳的六五％是輸往日本的這一點很可注目。</p>
<p>菲律賓失陷後給美國的打擊</p>
<p>美帝國主義永遠喪失　在菲律賓的宗中權了，在經濟方面，菲島暫時不得不忍受莫大的苦痛，這是美國多年統治的結果，從上述菲島對美依存性之大，可以想象，然而，美國失去了菲島的打擊，却是更加嚴重。有一部份人，以爲菲島是美國的一種拖累，失掉了沒有什麼痛苦，正像割去頸上的疣！這也有幾分道理的。依據一九三四年的菲律賓獨立法案，美國爲便利菲島獨立减少其對美依存性，對歷來自由貿易無稅輸入美國的菲島對美輸出品實行配分制課稅制，不過，實際上是由於古巴，夏威夷砂糖及椰子製品對美輸出商與菲商競爭的結果，爲了救助及維護美囪對古巴，夏威夷上述輸出業的投資者而實行的。那個法令又限制對美移民，表面也是爲了準備菲島獨立，實際是防止菲人移美，激化美國的失業恐慌！而且，獨立法案並未經與通貨自主權及與第三國通商目主權，還要求在獨立允許供給美海軍作根據地。不過純從經濟上着眼，美國對菲財政支出，貿易支付，都占着相當鉅大的數字，無異爲一種負担，放棄菲島以後，也許更合算些，美國的農業資本家和古巴夏威夷的輸出業者尤支持允許菲島獨立就是爲此，同樣，也可以說明爲什麼美國對於菲島的經營開發，缺乏熱忱，即對菲投資也不佔鉅大數量。因爲在帝國主義支配殖民地的對策中，美國與衆不同的一點，就是不取極端的榨取形態，而實行恩惠的支配，其根本原因就是美國國內市塲尚極廣大，雖然自一九二〇年以來力謀向海外膨脹，但所謂國內市塲第一主義的傳統都依然繼存着。但是美國是否願意完全放棄菲島，菲島喪失後對美國沒有什麼損害嗎？那又不盡然，而且是相反的。</p>
<p>因爲菲律賓是美國在亞洲唯一軍事的和經濟的根據地。這一看美國對亞洲歷來的欲望，尤其是一看大東亞戰前ABCD陣綫之結成，便可以瞭然的。關於菲島獨立問題，美國方面曾有不同的見解，以南部農業資本爲背景的民主黨，支持菲律賓獨立運動，而以金融資本爲背景的共和黨，則主張繼續支配菲島，不過這兩黨的背景並不那麼淸晰，而金融寡頭始終佔着優勢，特別是在戰爭中，菲島的軍略地位日益重要了，於是兩黨見解漸趨一致而決不再暢談菲島獨立：於是大批的美國派遣到菲，ABCD陣綫猛力邁進，並且大量地供給菲島以信用貸款，供給飛機及其他武器。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，終於使美國永遠喪失了菲律賓——這美國在亞洲唯一的軍事和經濟根據地，對美國最大的打擊是什麼呢，當然，它失去了菲島的錳，銘，鐵，麻等軍需資源，但是，這並不是致命的打擊，最重大的，還是使美國失掉了向亞洲活動的據點。菲島之失，不惟給日本以向荷印，馬來推進的戰略地點，而且同時喪失了向東亞進出的地盤，以後如再要恢復在東亞的覇權，是不可能了！這才是美國最感痛苦的一點。</p>
<p>新生菲島的建設</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發後不久，菲島就陷入日軍的控制之下了。回憶三百多年前西班牙征服菲島，費了三十多年的心力，美國占領菲島之後，內亂也延及三年，可是，現在日本佔領菲島，不過半年，已經全島戡平了。爲了維持治安，菲島軍政監部特將從事的市街警察制改爲國家警察，中央及地方，各設警官訓練所，並創辦一般民衆自警組織的保甲制度，一切行政工作，集中於治安第一主義，務求維持治安，不留間隙。</p>
<p>政治方面，鑒於菲島文化水準較高，所以採取儘量利用原有機構的方針，一月三日日軍入馬尼拉市，即於一月四日宣布此旨，至一月廿三日下命華爾加士氏組織中央行政府，在行政長官之下，設內務財政，司法，農商，敎育，厚生，土木交通等六部，另設實力機關—菲島軍政監部，而以華爾加士長官爲其一員。構成　政活用的機構。菲島中央行政府之下，地方行政機關　州，特別市及村，行政官吏任免權屬於日軍最高指揮官。所以從本質上說，菲島中央行政府，不過爲軍政監部的一個機關。</p>
<p>地方行政，戰前有四十九州，十特別市輿四百餘村，日軍佔領後，改爲四十三州，八特別市，州市長來已全部任命，村長亦有九成已經委出。一切機構人事，大都繼承戰前的傳統，不過實質上已有絕大的差別，即已將行政上的自由主義，物質主義等美國色彩，完全掃除，在戰前，舉凡州長，市長，村長及州市參事會員等，皆由民選，現在則由內務長官任命。而州市參事會，過去掌握州市政治大權，現在則成爲州市長的諮詢機關而已。</p>
<p>警察制度，向來爲市村警察制，現在改爲國家警察制。而在馬尼拉又設立中央官吏訓練所，對菲島行政府官吏加以新的訓練，不斷地進行吏治刷新工作。同時，在新事態下，不承認政治上的一切結社自由，嚴戒過去利用政黨的關係操縱政治的現象。又隨着新警察制度的確立，在馬尼拉設立警察官訓練所五處，調集警官，加以訓練。又設中央敎員養成所，以養成適應新事態的敎員。</p>
<p>爲了强化軍政，最近特又設立官民連絡所及實施保甲制度。前者爲上意下達與下悄上通的機關，其工作爲對市民進行啟蒙宣傳，敎育，民意調查職業指導等，造成軍民間的橋梁。後者不單在維持治安上具有重要意義，並將促成日本的隣組制度，在經濟的及精神的活用方針下，　與最近創的「菲島再建奉仕團」合力鞏固行政基礎。</p>
<h3>商品須標籖　售貨須發票　已令警捕沿途查騐</h3>

<h3>爲社會樹立百年大計　撫養孤苦的兒童　於艱難困苦中盡人類應盡責任　徐家滙聖母院育嬰堂訪問記</h3>
<p>幼有所養，壯有所敎，老有所終，這是社會上何等迫切的事：尤其在這時艱多故，哀鴻遍野的今日，要談敎養，是何等難事，惟其爲何等難事，更加需要羣力來扶助。本報舉辮助學金，不過盡了敎字極小部分的　力，談到養」字，深慚暫時無從效力。偶然的機會，同時也具着誠意的訪問，到了徐家匯聖母院育嬰堂，我們感到這一般孤苦的兒童，我們想到將來社會的需要，我們覺得應予紀述以祈求社會羣力，來維護這艱鉅的事業。</p>
<p>曾經撫育了　七八萬兒童</p>
<p>在徐家滙蒲東路花園蔬圃的環境中，矗立着寬大高樓，這所高樓中，曾經撫育了七八萬的兒童，施以敎育，授予技藝。當然有不少人已經在社會上建立了事業，可是現時在撫養中却還有五百五十人；計襁褓至二三歲的小兒一百八十餘人，自四五歲至十五歲的，有二百人左右，十五歲以上者近百人。</p>
<p>創辦進百年　聲譽遍海內</p>
<p>我們走進了這所大厦，覺得有兩種感想：一種是感於此輩孤苦兒女身世的凄凉，一種是覺得他在凄凉的過度中已經獲得了光明。？我們和修女談話，知道該院設立已近百年，辦理爲人羣謀福利的事業，如興學·濟貧·安老·慈幼諸端：該院所設崇德啟明二女學，歷史悠久，聲譽卓著，其原設之老人院及殘廢院，則於三十年前，蛻化而爲安老院，爲新普育堂；今聖母院除附設崇德啓明二女校，及托兒所，中西施診所外，對於育嬰堂及聾啞學校，則管理更不稍懈忽，且特設刺繡所，花邊問·裁縫作·洗衣間等處</p>
<p>聾啞學校奇蹟</p>
<p>我們所引爲奇蹟的，就是在參觀聾啞學校的時候，覺得他們的成績殊可驚人；他們先以字母，助以手勢，敎之出音，再逐漸敎之識字寫字讀書作文；經過三四年後，啞童即能與他人言語，聽者都能了解，五六年後幾與常人發音相同，這種彌補人類天然缺憾的工作，眞是聾啞童孩的救星。</p>
<p>刺繡及花邊　外界可定購</p>
<p>我們到了刺繡間，見女工四十餘人在刺着花卉山水鳥獸照像，他們承接外界定繡，在一九二四年曾經獲得羅馬展覽會的獎憑，在花邊間裏，也有四十餘人在工作，舉凡被單台布枕套手巾縫衣絨綫編織應有盡有，各界前往定製的也很不少。　我們經迴兩進臥室，都是七大間的建築，瞧着每一個嬰兒，都安臥在小鐵床裏，衣被整潔，看護周到。四五歲的兒童在幼稚園上課，正在舉習識字，比較長前的兒童分別在初高小學上課。</p>
<p>給養的困難　我們有責任</p>
<p>物價的騰漲，减低了讀堂兒童的營養，據修女談稱：本堂經費，往年大多數由法國慈善家捐助，不幸歐戰爆發之後，捐款完全斷絕，日常開支，旣無的款，而生活程度，日益增高，本堂遂陷入從來未有之困難中；孩童最需營養，昔日嬰兒，以牛乳爲中要食品，今祗能以粥湯奶粉充飢；二三歲之小兒，則由稍長之孤女，喂食糜粥，粥內僅和入素菜湯少許；四五歲兒童，一日三餐，每人食一小碗飯，或一小碗粥，下午僅予以極少量之點心；七八歲以上，則每早晚各食粥兩碗，中午則麵一碗，飯一碗，每叫人食一菜一湯，每星期五食鹹魚一小塊，星期日食豬肉小塊，則僅如蠶豆瓣，而名雖粥飯，實則以秈米·碎米·珍珠米·番薯·等合煮而成者。</p>
<p>我們關心着全堂給　的困難，據我們看見的，這五白餘兒童每月須食米六十石連同一切費用，每月需五萬餘元，而房屋修理等費均不在內。我們想到此　皆無辜赤子，雖已見棄於父母，豈容見絕於人羣，若坐視其死亡，則大背好生之義，若聽從其飄蕩，則行見流民之增。，社會上應該共同設法來扶助他們成人，使國家多一良民，即社會多一裨補。</p>
<p>我們當然應以十萬分的同情，來向社會陳述，並且希望各界能親往參觀，予以經濟上的援助，至於代收捐款的地方有如下列；</p>
<p>（一）徐家匯蒲東路聖母院育嬰堂，電話七〇二三五，</p>
<p>（二）法租界外灘九號中法工商銀行，（三）四　路寗波路四六一號謙泰銀行，電話一二六四九，（四）南京路十三六號和泰銀行，電話一○五五四號，捐款人亦可以話通知派員收款，</p>
<p>孤苦兒童的樂園徐家滙聖母院育嬰堂創立已近百年、養育兒童已七八萬名、左圖（上）整齊清　　戲有序的孤兒、（下）孤兒用膳、期待各界捐款、來充足他們的　養</p>

<h3>改良上川路的意見</h3>
<p>— 旅客</p>
<p>今年元旦，我內事退鄉，在戰前由上海到川沙祇須二小時就能到　，現在竟須七八小時、且擁擠雜亂，莫可名狀，雖祗短短的路程，十有舟車勞頓之槪。茲將所感不便之處，撮要略述，深望名責當局，注意　以改善。</p>
<p>上海十三號碼頭，停靠之船隻　多，故似宜碰闢　出口，並携帶行李和貨物的，同單身旅客，應分別進出，而檢查手續亦宜明快，使後面的人减少鵠候之苦，而免脫班之虞。</p>
<p>碼頭上應　造棚蓋，置備坐椅，使候船的　受日曬雨淋，而老弱婦孺得略資休息。</p>
<p>變前上川路民營時，車票和市輪渡船票，　採聯票制的，乘客祇須購一張票，即能到達終點，現在旣歸市辦，更應繼續採聯票制成法，不宜分購，以節省人力和時　，像這次返鄉，在慶寗寺車站上等候買票，竟達三小時之久，待售票處開始售票，在站裏的人往外擠，站外的人往裏軋，二邊旅客都擁在票房　，使買得車票的，被軋在中間，旣不能　又不能進，老弱婦孺，更有被擠塲之虞。</p>
<p>現在　車班次，每日僅有三班，班次旣少，時刻必須準確，像　前渡輪和火車的時間是銜接着的，旅客到慶寗寺後，換車換船毋須久候，如今時刻衣上雖載明中班車十二時一刻到，十二時四十分開，但那天直到下午二時二刻到，至三時十分開，旅客大抵自午前十一時等起，無不等得飢腸轆轆，腰酸背直，詢之車站近邊之食物攤，據謂脫班爲常有之事，現在祇能說定每天爲三班車，至於時刻則不能有　確的依　。請當局宜注意，因爲這樣小但浪　旅客的時間和金錢，（飢餓時購買食物）而且使旅客誤事。</p>
<p>渡輪票價，應照票面定價發售，不能多收，上海至慶寗寺票價，印明一元叫角，却須收一元五角，此　誥誡職員，不應浮收。</p>
<p>還有，上川路沿綫的鐵路橋邊，本有木橋　人行走，現在木橋橋向什　被人偷拆，　人　，殊爲危險，故亟望公用局早日修復，以利　人。</p>

<h3>日本預算全貌　昭和十八度</h3>
<p>日本昭和十八年度財政將爲決戰時期財政。大東亞戰爭發生後不久即　舉行之第七十九屆議會，通過昭和十七年度一般會計歲出預算爲八十八億三千八百餘萬圓，及臨時軍事費預算百八十億圓，決戰第二年即十八年度一般會計歲出入預算（連追加第一，二號預算在內）爲白卅二億七千五百餘萬圓，於本月十三日在衆議院無條件無修正通過。本月十日在兩院成立之第九次臨時軍事費預算達三百六十億三十五百餘萬圓之鉅額。與中國事變前昭和十一年度之歲出二十三億圓比較起來，激增十餘倍，在日本預算上未之前見。今日國家經濟運營的目標之一，爲急速擴充物的戰力，以謀戰時生產力之增强，故一切財政經濟政策以及明年度預算之編造，均山此點出發，戰時財政之本質不能不爲嚴正之重心主義與效率主義。</p>
<p>昭和十八年度預算內容</p>
<p>就歲出預算上看，自前年度起，陸海軍兩省所管轄之經費併人臨時軍事費，故陸海軍兩省听管歲出預算合計僅百八十三萬餘圓，比前年度减少七千七百餘萬圓，比大前年度减少三十二億四千八百餘萬圓。</p>
<p>旣定經費之節約及减少爲三億六千八百餘萬圓，比前年度之三億五千四百餘萬圓不過增加一千四百餘萬圓。如上歲出預算，曾極力擬使合理化，但比前年度尚增加三十九億五千七百餘萬圓，此由於下述諸原因所致。即國債，年金，及恩給費，國民學校敎員俸給分担金，警察費連帶支辦金，軍事扶助費等項目年有增加，挪用於臨時軍事費者增加十六億一千五百餘萬圓，加以國庫預備金在本預算中原爲第一預備金五千萬圓，第二預備金八億圓，茲由追加預算中前者追加三千萬圓，後者追加七億圓，結果比前年增加七億三千萬圓。茶從歲出總額百三十二億七千五百餘萬中，除去上述帶有義務性質之諸經費三十六憶九千五百餘萬圓，更除去因時局的要求而新增之新規重要經費之差額，則純粹行政費比本年度預算减少約八千萬圓。</p>
<p>直接供給大東亞戰爭之戰費者爲臨時軍事費，自第一次至第九次之臨時軍事費預算總計額達七百四十一億二千八百餘萬圓之巨，大東亞戰爭北起阿留申羣島，南至南太平洋海域在如此　　區域中展開激戰，一面，並須在南方諸占領地區供給共榮圈　設所需要之費用，故臨時軍事費歲出之膨脹，乃爲勢所必然之　實。</p>
<p>爲供應此歲出　支出者，以公債及　稅爲大宗。本年初次實行以間　稅爲中心的大增稅，比往年度十一億四千五百餘萬圓預算可增收十億七百餘萬圓。又烟草亦自上月十七日以來實　增稅，預計　比往年　增收四億四千二百餘萬圓。間接稅增徵額均歸入於臨時軍費財源。</p>
<p>租稅收入經常部分　六十億六千餘萬圓，臨時部分爲十五億二千九百餘萬圓，合計達七十五億八千九百餘萬圓。比前年增加十八億二千九百餘萬圓。因臨時軍車費的膨脹，國債發行額不免有顯著增加。十八年度之一般會計及各特別會計中，臨時軍事費追加預算合計起來，達二百十　億二千餘萬圓。爲消化　鉅額經費，國發不得不加以相當努力。</p>
<p>大東亞財之核心</p>
<p>大東亞共榮圈之建設，自以日本財政爲大東亞財政之核心。南方開發金庫獲得行使發券業務之權利，從該金庫借入三十三億圓，作爲此次臨時軍事費財源之一部。日本財政依南方占領地域　設進行之程度，給予種種協力。此次段定之特殊財產資金特別會計，即爲處理敵產之方策，　增强生產，並爲軍事　　要，而爲日本戰時財政之補强策。又由於　立交易營團而設定之調整滙兌交易特別會計，即　脫離金鎊，金元，而以日圓爲大東亞共榮圈內之指導通貨，今日，滿洲國，中國當然與日本經濟合作，即與泰　越南之物資交易，今後亦正期待其有更健全之發展，日本在大東亞戰爭中獲得豐富之　方資源復，已一躍而爲富有的國家。目前，國家財政，在整個經濟上，占絕對的立塲同時，經濟若不能圓滑通用，則財政上　然亦有窒礙。</p>
<p>明年度國民所得預估有五百億圓，其分配預定爲租稅及其他百億回，與和稅有同樣性質之公債二百十億圓，生產擴充資金六十億圓，國民消費資金百二十億圓。其中公債與生產擴充資金合計二百七十億圓一項，於明年度，希望一億　民不用租稅形式完納，爲完遂戰爭而出以貯蓄形式，以此爲國民儲蓄目標額，國民由於納稅的義務以及自動的與當局合作，以完成此國民儲蓄。翔：譯自二月十六日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>日本宣傳戰要點　協約國間同床異夢</h3>
<p>衆議院今井新造氏於十五日午後一時在決算委員會上質詢政府宣傳戰之現狀，奧村情報局次長之答辭大要如次：</p>
<p>英美間猜忌之內幕</p>
<p>宣傳戰與武力戰性質俱極重大，宣傳戰常集中敵之弱點，因此，政府在英美國內事情之報道上，極爲注意，以此爲宣傳之資料。宣傳之原則，常從深入檢討其國民性之觀點出發，此次大戰中日德義之宣傳目的，以建設世界新秩序爲一貫的原則，極爲明瞭。反之，英美之戰爭目的則缺乏一貫性，是以英美谷行其是，各爲其自己目的宣傳。</p>
<p>如去年十一月十日邱吉爾對國民明確宣稱戰爭之目的，爲「英國不能不繼續維持幾百年來制覇世界之現狀，吾人即係爲此而戰爭。」對此，美國完全否認，羅斯福去秋授意威爾基宣稱：「美國人民之犧牲，並不爲維持英國之繁榮而戰，寗爲打破英國的舊秩序而在世界上製造新的聯合國」，於是兩者之間，遂發生了極大的暗礁。</p>
<p>要之，美國目中　已無英國，而自欲掌握世界覇權之野心，明然若揭。英美之關係，並未發生密切聯繫，在戰爭目的上，即已不一致。英國對美國之將南美諸國拉入自己懷抱，深爲不滿，况美國兵之派遣於澳洲，印度，南美，更非英國民所能容忍，於是遂發生種種摩　，尤以英國法律不適用於美國兵，使央國民心極爲怕激，而演出各種衝突。</p>
<p>最近，諾克斯對新聞記者團宣稱：「自太平洋諸島以至全世界，到處　添設美國認爲必要之飛機塲」，英國方面對此，爲　激。邱吉爾與羅斯福在加薩勃朗加之會談，並未使兩國有更圓滿聯絡。兩國首腦者以爲若不於此地會集商談，則不足以使特戈爾派與季祿派成立妥協，然而實際上並無成就。不單在官傳戰上，即在此等處亦可以看出英美一夥中之最大困惱。</p>
<p>政府覷準此弱點，而施行極適切之宣傳戰，頗有成就。</p>
<p>蘇聯亦不信任英美</p>
<p>以言英美蘇之。係，亦　保持融洽無間的友誼。英美並不以蘇聯之勝得而欣喜，僅以蘇聯爲利用而已。蘇聯亦洞悉其中關係，故對英美亦不寄以過甚的信賴，事實上英美始終未供給蘇聯充分的武器彈藥，以北菲戰綫爲第一，戰綫的宣傳，蘇聯逈不加以重　，斯達林之不參加加薩勃朗加會談，其中原委，不難想像得之。</p>
<p>空中樓閣之援蔣聲</p>
<p>英美與重慶的關係，在大東亞戰爭開始前，曾以重慶爲世界之寵兒，在今日的地位，則完全顚倒，英美成爲戰爭之中心，重慶所予之影像極爲薄弱。因而對重慶之軍事援助，亦不充分。重慶之駐美大使，在華盛頓被視爲眼中之釘，此可以證明事情之內幕。尤其自緬甸失陷以後，援蔣物資之補給，完全斷絕，宋美齡以此渡美泣訴，然亦未獲得預期的效果。</p>
<p>宋美齡訪美　，不久即覆車傷足，但却宣傳爲遭受日本之轟炸，以博民衆之同情，此　顯出宣傳方法之無聊。</p>
<p>如上所述，可見敵方陣營之戰爭目的，在根本上即已不一致。而常起動　，日本方面正密切注視此事態，而講求適切的方法加以利用。（翔：譯自二月十六日東京每日新聞。）</p>
<h3>德國國民生活改造</h3>
<p>（柏林收特派員六日發）神秘而嚴肅的柏林之夜，出租汽車停止自由營業了，繁盛。塲所，杳無人影。沉寂的寒夜，唯相對默視的覺悟，堆積於斯達林格勒廢墟上的死骸的光榮，使德國魂上下凝結如一。畫間，在街中閑走，常聽見設：「很好，上次大戰末期的辛酸，相差尚遠哩！」無綫電商店裏的老夥計，軋拉軋拉地把店門關起來，無綫電商因四日發表的非戰時營業停止令，限於三月十五日以前關店。平靜的國民，今正耐受着可驚的國民生活的大改造。因爲一九一八年的慘敗的敎訓，因爲第六軍的困迫所引起的覺醒，使國民不能不忍受這改造國民沉醉於戰爭初期的戰果，去年冬季戰告終後，認爲困難業已過去，希特勒總統有鑒於此，儘量使大家明瞭戰事的實况，這在最後勝利的爭取上，不失爲賢明的舉措。於是，「那麼該輪到我們了」，自由志願婦人，都踏進軍需工塲工作。</p>
<p>例如本社柏林分局的女傭，自動向勞慟營報到，提供她個人的勞慟力。這一類的女傭，與自十七歲至四十五歲的婦人動員令並無抵觸，如在分局服務，儘可不加理會，但她們却都自願報效，像這種女子的奮起，正可視爲德國緊張的證明，因而女子的生活的變化，比男子的更加激烈。</p>
<p>鑽石店，金銀細工事店的關閉，對於一般女性的心理，雖無多大刺激，但女子時裝店，美容院，香水店都沒有了，在理髮店中不能洗髮了，這對於歐洲的女性是一種革命。</p>
<p>「覺得悲觀嗎？」</p>
<p>在此時而發此言，實屬愚問。即使時髦與化妝被剝奪，但現在的女子已不復是女子了，斯達林格勒的悲劇，使德國的女性，用熱淚洗落了脂粉的顏色。　意志民族的女子，澈底的實行新生活運動，英美女子利用之爲惡宣傳的資料，在國際的虛榮心上挑戰，遠非共對手，她們的流淚，並不是爲了沒有脂粉，乃是水獲爭取戰事的勝利。</p>
<p>某　知的年靑婦人，寄來一封信，上　寫着：</p>
<p>「因爲戰綫上丈夫的升擢，我現在是曹長夫人了。孩子們日見活潑可愛，爲軍人的妻子，不能不撫養這些孩子，强烈地生存下去。」</p>
<p>這與日本女性的心理相同，有這種强烈的精神表現出來，德國將絕對不會戰敗的。日本人的思想，原以覺悟爲接近於死，此與從來德國人的思想在本質上雖有所不　，但鮑　斯元帥以下忠於其義務的觀念，而慷慨赴義的行爲，不復有德國人的氣息，實在是富於戲劇性的使人感動。</p>
<p>日本的自爆，曾使行國人感動。現在本國的英雄亦有此種行動，乃使後力的民心更加震動而至於涕立，無意識中　前綫兵士持着同仇敵愾的心情，此次後方生活的革命，實由此而生。</p>
<p>「整三天間娛樂塲所的休息，是國民的一種　禱的姿態。在前次大戰中，此等事運想都沒有想起，」一老婦人嚅嚅地說。今後，所有的夜閒娛樂塲所，酒塲，飲食店、均將停閉，但食糧方面，一星期尚能食肉三百五十公分。當回憶在一九一七—八年每日僅食野菜三次而仍頑戰時，萬一今後亦將至此地步，但國民的胸襟，亦巳充滿了大丈夫的自信，而且當時是物資缺乏的結果，現在則物資不慮缺乏，又爲「神之選民」，德國人的生活，固能屈能伸，另有一種生命的躍動。在國社黨秉政十週年紀念的總統宣言中稱：「在戰後殘缺而生存的國家與滅亡的國家不再存在了」。這一種自覺，深刻地滲透人心的根底，不問老少男女，重復堅定其必勝的決心，一九一八年西部戰綫及一九四二十三年東部戰綫的敗績，使德意志魂格外團結，由於生活的改迭，鑄成後方堅牢不拔的鐵壁。（翔：譯自二月八日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>德艦隊北冰洋出征記</h3>
<p>擊沉英國運輸船</p>
<p>一望無際的茫茫北　海洋，　展開在我們的眼前了。偵察歸來的一架海上飛機，隆隆地飛翔在我們頭上，傳遞重要的消息。緊接着，發出的警報聲，打破了航行中艦隊的沉寂。士兵們迅速地各自　了戰鬬崗位，然而毫未覺察，突然看到前面駛着一艘大型運輸船。不用說，這是英國運輸船，也如所料，是一艘有武裝的船。　自己偵察機報告，這是一萬八千噸至二萬噸的船。</p>
<p>但，一個鐘頭後，才確定這隻船，實際上是二萬一千噸巨型運輸船「奧拉姆」號。</p>
<p>講起來眞够滑稽，這艘運輸船在未見到第一　砲彈打到身旁時，還始終以爲我們是回伴，而未覺察出是　國軍艦。</p>
<p>我們軍艦的大砲，接着又是一次怒吼。讓英國人知道個中厲害，也只有這種辦法。敵艦受到一彈轟擊後，船員們似　完全失掉了抵抗情緒，立刻想捨棄這隻船，開始跳人救命艇，溜之大吉了。於是我　停止射擊，我們的巡洋艦　　逐艦排列　划近敵船，把逃難的敵國船員都收容到我　的軍艦　。全數船員收容完畢時，這隻敵船也就開始向人間作最後的告別。須臾間，龐然大物沉入冰海的深底了。</p>
<p>我們的艦隊，並不减低馬力，浩浩蕩蕩繼續前進。我們的戰艦，不僅迅速，且有高度航行力，因此才能來這樣遙遠的海角作戰。現在我們活動的地方，是遠離祖國足有一千海里外的一片汪洋上。所謂一千海里，等於從漢堡到非洲沿岸那樣遠。</p>
<p>發現敵國航空母艦</p>
<p>現在我們有兩艘戰艦，巳經離　了隊伍。這兩　脫離的軍艦—一艘巡　艦和另一艘驅逐艦—，變爲別動隊，而去進行其特殊的作戰任務。現在留下的一　艘戰艦，單獨在冰海中搜索敵蹤。</p>
<p>黃昏慢慢地到來，而在遙遠的天邊，發現　縷黑烟。該處因爲是澈夜明亮，所以黃昏後仍然不黑。這眞是上天給我們開的方便之門。我們按烟縷數目判斷，很像是三隻船。我們也都在祈望着，是英國船，如此則又可以大顯身手了。</p>
<p>不久，在我們精細的望遠鏡裏，淸晰地　到這三艘船　。是兩艘英國驅逐艦在　　着一艘航空母艦航行。這一艘航空母艦，毫不掩飾地敞　着全部寬人。甲板：眞的，我們的驅逐艦若和這　龐然大物比較，正像小巫見大巫了。就在這一瞬間，我們艦隊司令長官和各部指揮官間的聯繫，緊張而密切起來。正當驚天動地的大事件即將爆發時，一切的一切，却都像鐵一般的恬靜。</p>
<p>艦隊司令長官於是冷靜而沉着地發出簡單明瞭的命令。司令長官所發下的命令，立刻一個傳一個地　複朗誦着傳達給各部指揮官。這時跟發見英國軍艦時的不動聲色情况，仍然沒有改變。敵方誤認了我艦是他們底夥伴。他們絕對想不到，德國艦隊會這樣跨海征洋來到此地。</p>
<p>開始聶擊</p>
<p>常時斷定我們和前面敵國驅逐艦的距離，至多不過十五公里，和航空母艦的距離，有二十四公里。</p>
<p>在我們凝視着敵艦烟囱裏呼呼地　着漆黑濃烟的當兒，敵艦突然改變了　進方向。這是敵人一直到現在才發覺錯認了我們，所以及決定改變陣形。</p>
<p>然而就掉轉不易的航空母艦說，却是遲了。敵國航空母艦早已落入我們主力砲的有射程內了。牠正想脫逃的當，我們司令長官就　大聲下，「轟擊！」</p>
<p>我們的砲早就瞄準敵艦，繼續不停地隨着敵艦　動　移</p>
<p>大砲不斷地在殷殷作　。中距離砲把自己的火力都集中在前面的驅逐艦上。人型砲全都對着航空母艦射擊。第　彈，有力地射去。</p>
<p>我們都靜靜地屛着氣息，各自尋找目標。我們瞭如指掌地看到，企圖起飛的飛機，在航空母艦　板上拼命　掙扎。</p>
<p>「好，到時候了！」</p>
<p>最初究竟誰這樣喊叫的，以至於我們究竟向其他部份的伙伴吼叫些什麼，現在自己怎麼也記憶不出。　而只是淸楚地記得，我們　看到頭一個砲彈準確地命中敵艦時，不約而同地發出有　的喊叫烏拉！砲彈炸毀了飛機的甲板，這等於完全剝奪了敵人所依賴的主要堅强武器。</p>
<p>周圍一看，每個弟兄底驚喜笑容上，都掛着淡淡的紅色。敵艦在增加航行速度，雖然甲板塌陷，但仍努　掙扎，想　飛機飛出。須臾　　航空母艦又接二連三地受到致命的轟擊，於是母艦上的飛機，一架也未得幸免地都被打下水去。由砲塔裏熊熊地冒着火熖，而硫黃色的火藥烟氣，逐漸把整個敵艦身體籠罩起來。這種烟很快地一面向周團擴張着，而一面又向船尾移動。同時，我們的船，一尺一尺地逼近了敵艦。敵人似乎是受了過重的致命打擊。</p>
<p>敵國驅逐艦的死命掙扎</p>
<p>驅逐艦這次似乎是總想玩弄一些新的戰術。前面的驅逐艦逐漸提　速度，而想從船身的左面構成一個斜方形。撤起濃厚的烟幕，使漆黑一團的烟霧什海上飄蕩。很　顯，這是企圖使航空母艦逃出我們的追擊。另外一艘敵方驅逐艦，也在始　拼命地替這艘重要的航空母艦　放烟幕。</p>
<p>果然，藉烟幕的庇護、而得以暫時地逃避我們準確的砲火，刹那間，航空母艦的形影消逝了，而只有龐大的，漆黑的烟霧，在海上順風飄蕩。我們的大砲，也只好暫時停止吼叫。我們在作着開砲的姿勢，鎭定地等待着烟霧的消失，一時一刻地　在　待着轟擊底機會。</p>
<p>可是，烟幕被風　一條條　撕破了。因此我們的砲火，　機又開始撲去。片　間，各處都起了烈火，如是可以斷定，我們的砲彈很準地射中目標。</p>
<p>眞可惜，我們的驅逐艦　得參加這悲壯的戰鬥。如果驅逐艦參加這戰鬥，那未　定會更快地結束。然而我們的兩條戰艦「古奈策諾號　一夏　赫斯德」號　如未澈底消滅敵人，從不肯罷休。欲達此目的、就無　如何不要放鬆敵八，更不要給敵人逃走的機會。</p>
<p>砲彈在一刻不停地，連串地由砲口飛出。我艦開足馬力，向前挺進。海戰的情景　在這　瞬　，正達到最高潮，實在具有無比的詩情劇意。蔚藍的天空，無邊無際的籠罩着這個　海。因爲天空非常淸朗，所以肉眼都可以淸淸楚楚地刻劃出戰鬥底輪廓。只是在前面，有稠密的水墻由右舷披到左舷。在這種排空的水墻前面，敵方航空母艦剛剛躥出來，總覺得道一母艦好像是想逃　水晶宮。</p>
<p>英國驅逐艦吐出的人工烟霧，笨重而强烈地在翻轉　。那很像熾烈燃燒中的汽油底濃烟一般黑。我們這個軍艦上，每次發出砲彈後，靜靜地總帶出一些褐色的硝磺烟來。</p>
<p>請看敵人那方面，爆炸的榴彈在不斷地激起高高的水柱。水柱，最先作黑色，然而一瞬間就變爲白色，此時此刻，更夾雜着時時出現的紅亮火熖，而汹湧的烟流，在膨脹著，上，上昇着。這就是帶來死亡與毀滅的命中彈之功績。</p>
<p>敵國航空母艦趨向沉沒</p>
<p>敵艦完全被火焰　包圍了。無論怎樣想逃　或躱避，但在德國軍艦的　確砲火與精妙作戰前，一切都不會發生效力。然後，我們的砲火又集中到敵國驅逐艦上。但敵方驅逐艦非常敏捷，而身體一躱閃，則逃出我們攻擊底砲火。然而一再的躱閃，到了此刻也沒有用了。我們一分錡不停地淮行轟擊，一彈又一彈地落到敵艦身傍。我軍砲術的高妙，在此得到一個證明。在　鬥最激烈的期間，司令長官也曾三番五次地讚揚自己砲手們的精巧射術。</p>
<p>當然，所謂戰鬥，就不是單純一方面的行動，而也是對方的行動。在我們軍艦的旁邊，也常常被敵方砲彈轟起過高高的水柱。敵方航空母艦和驅逐艦，還不承認戰鬥失敗。驅逐艦仍在勉强抖擻精神，瘋在地努力於防禦戰。也計他們在期待着戰局的好轉。</p>
<p>敵方驅逐艦，一再從後面拉起烟幕後而消逝。正當你以爲牠消失的時候，突然衝出烟幕，暴露出自己的形體來，張開所有的放射管，向我們戰艦放射魚雷，立刻閃電似地，又逃入烟幕的暗影裏。當時我們戰艦，每次都發出魚雷警報的汽笛聲，由於極盡巧妙的駕駛技術，幸而得以逃出敵人多數魚雷的危險網。</p>
<p>我們的中距離砲，現在集中一切砲火，向前面左舷傾斜的敵方驅逐艦，開始共同的轟擊了。砲彈像雨點　地向海上飛出。刹那間，前面立起來了一個大的水團。英國的驅逐艦也就　聲陷落在烈火燃燒中了。片刻間，這艘驅逐艦的運命，就此告一段落。我們看到，這艘驅逐艦，的確不能再動轉一步了。</p>
<p>砲火少微停頓一下，注意一看，敵　驅逐艦正將翻觔斗，傾斜成一個銳角。因此，我們就停止對這一驅逐艦底進攻。敵方驅逐艦由傾斜，而竟至全身沉沒海底。</p>
<p>在這　期間，我們的砲並未　懈地向敵方航空母艦施行猛攻。敵方航空母艦失却了戰鬥意志，而想逃之夭夭。但，已經太遲了。此次決定戰鬥過程底主要因素，只是我們這一個艦隊。（德國海軍記者李斯德者，季：譯自　十二年一月「海洋少年四十四號」）</p>
<h3>河南難民流離實况</h3>
<p>自去年秋天以來，每天陸續有衣衫襤褸的難民，在寒風中自河南渡越險峻的省境至山西，據一月中旬山西省公署所公佈的數字，已達十餘萬。此等難民都因最近因渝軍及共產軍的擴軍工作而逃避出來，因經濟被封鎖，故困窮不堪言狀，聽到山西省公署區域的安樂，遂蠭擁而來。山西省公署對此彷徨於飢餓死亡綫上的河南同胞，仲出了溫暖的援救的手，以省長名義，發出訓令，制定山西省入境難民臨時救濟辦法。支　百萬元，從速着手救濟。爲響應省方的救濟，自太原市以至各地的中日機關都活躍起來。河南農民進人山西省境的狀况實是一篇至爲悲慘的哀史。在中國參加大東亞戰爭之際，我人以爲對此遍野哀鴻，不能不設法救濟。</p>
<p>現在河南農民逃入山西的路徑有自南且東二條。稍有錢的出自　漢綫兩　，沿錢北上，至石門，沿石太綫入山西。此等乘汽車進入山西的農民，情况較佳。冒嚴寒，被風沙，越險峻的省境，而進入華北高地山西的農民羣，顚沛流離，困苦萬分。記者訪問潞安城內自南方避難來此的農民，而獲悉他們的狀况。農民們飢寒交迫，賴着傳聞中樂土的希望，鼓起勇氣拖着疲勞而硬直的脚渡過黃河，而至山西省公署地區。</p>
<p>行近省境，出現於他們眼前而遮斷他們去路的，是衝天而立的重山疊嶺，他們不得不掙扎前進，筋疲力盡的婦女孩子們，出聲大哭者有之，置於籠中的乳嬰兒的吞泣，刺傷了這悲哀的一羣人們的心胸，山的那面是快樂的，待在此地只有死，鼓起勇氣來走的年邁的農夫，鼓動這一羣向前。這一羣人雖有百名，但不都是同「同村之衆」，是鄰近的幾村落中湊集的，他們手中提着雜碎，背上負着重荷，有妻者携妻，有　者牽子，在黑暗的夜間，避開監視與鄉里訣別而出行。互相激勵，互相扶助，在向山西治安地區行進所經過的路上，又遇到了別村不謀而合的農民們，如此，幾個村落的農民，而集合成一個很大的集團。現在再進而報告河南難民的實情。</p>
<p>河南的地土並不瘠瘦，黃河流過，造成了適宜於耕作的天然肥沃的地帶。但在去年雨季中，大豪雨使黃河汜濫，敵方地區自新黃河西岸至安徽省，綿延百二十公里的大　原被吞沒於洶湧的濁流，二百四十萬住民彷徨於死亡綫，加以傳染病極爲狷獗，死傷者數萬人。從這時起，河南民衆即陸續開始向和平地區避難，黃河的汜濫，不單是河南民衆的大不幸，渝軍陣地亦全被濁流淹沒，蒲州對岸大慶關的渝軍陣地被淹沒三分之二，兵士數千，多數糧秣兵器，都被大水冲失。因黃河南　地區一帶的大水，致敵軍的軍需物資甚爲缺乏。軍隊就地微，激起—民衆的反抗。中央軍孫桐萓　營內的軍紀廢弛，渡黃河而逃亡至物資豐富，物價低　的山西的敵兵，日見　增。</p>
<p>降臨河南的天災更有西方一帶的大旱魃，洛陽及豫西地區的農作物，慘滅至往年的六成，一般農民至爲窮困。政府對此並不講求任何救濟的方策，田賦採用物納制，把當時五元一斤的麥估價爲二角八分一斤，失去了唯一食　的民衆，對於當局的施政極爲怨恨。　　，禹縣地方的農民化爲土匪，大肆不逞。方　　　大　店一帶，民衆均　　　充飢，命在日夕。七月下旬，爲要求停止物納制千五百名民衆發生暴　襲擊各所。河南的水災與早魃，造成此悽慘的活地獄，民衆彷徨於曠野，爲爭食一果實而展開流血的爭　。至秋季收穫期，窮乏更　。九月末的收穫，不及往時的一成或二成。即此極貧弱的收穫亦全部被敵軍强制　發。住民甚至連吞一粒麥　自由也沒有，在此虐待下民農村民衆傳聞在新政權下有安居樂業之地，於是遂離棄荒凉的鄕里，一莊村一村莊結隊陸續向晉南地區避難。</p>
<p>渝政權對民衆的向晉南逃難，極感恐慌，强制向西北地區移民，並向重慶泣訴，請求　施若干救濟的方策，但也不過是滄海一粟，無濟於事。關於這河南飢饉的慘狀，在渝區的外人記者亦有如次的報道。</p>
<p>渝軍方面强制河南的難民向西北移動，以作開發的勞働力，逃亡者不絕於途，因飢寒而死於隴海沿綫者纍纍。於是遂暫時停止難民向境外移動。</p>
<p>河南難民的慘狀大體如上述，據最近的情報，不僅黃河南岸的旱災，即黃河北岸的慘狀亦有所聞，以陵川地區爲中心的渝擴軍工作曾將所捕的難民以不能養活而終於放　，此等被放逐的難民也向山西和平地區流入。山西省對河南省難民的臨時救濟措置，在省民協力下講求如次諸方策，各縣知事，使縣民　底履行：</p>
<p>（一）縣民應自動的救濟，並獻呈金飾以充捐款。</p>
<p>（二）絕對禁止出以非人道的行爲。</p>
<p>（三）有求職者予以工作。</p>

<h3>需要真正的熱情</h3>
<p>— 川我</p>
<p>在十二日本刋上見到遠濤君的我們需要熱情」一文，覺得尚有未盡之處，很　再說幾句。</p>
<p>遠濤君說：「我們需要的是熱情　發的人，一團和氣的人，和笑口常開的人，因爲唯有他們才能使冷酷的社會變爲熱烘烘的社會。」我固然同意需要熱情奮發的人，但却不敢盡信一團和氣　和「笑口常開」的人都能使「冷酷的社會變爲熱烘烘的社會」。「一團和氣」的人，的確有時能使和他接觸的人有「和煦如春」之感，但這却非一定由於他底內心的熱忱，也許不過是假示親切而已；因爲他旣抱着。「一團和氣」的主義——也就是抱着「圓」的處世的態度——則對於社會上必定手段圓滑，八面玲瓏，承意巧笑，假作殷勤：表面上可以被人視爲「和善君子」，實際上或許是會運用手腕，暗圖私利的眞小人。至於有些「笑口常開」的人，他底「處世良方」當然不弱於「一團和氣」者，而「笑面虎」，「笑裏藏刀」更形容出這卅人底心地了。鏡花緣裏所描寫的兩面國的人，前「面」是滿面春風，喜笑迎人，後「面」却是靑面獠牙，兇臉可怕，正給他們一個良好的寫照</p>
<p>當然，這些偽君子是只能代表一部分「一團和氣」和「笑口常開」的人，還有一部分確實是以赤誠待人而絕不懷惡意的，但社會仍不大會因這些和善的人而變爲「熱烘烘」，因爲在道紊亂的社會中，受了生活的折磨，和爲了少數麵包的爭奪，人類會變得更自私更無情的，於是，　這一個多數人瀕於「冷冰冰」的困境的人世中，少數人的「雍容揖讓」和「笑嘻嘻一團和氣」又那能給人們以大量的熱情而使這社會必然「熱烘烘」起來呢？</p>
<p>眞正的使這社會「熱拱烘」起來，我以爲，應該待到凡工作者都無飢寒之虞，大家咸能去私務公，走在一塊爲同一目標而努力的時候；要臻此目的，必須有賴於有着博愛的心田，願貢獻一己於大我，然而絕不是阿諛社會，迎奉大家的人，他們對社會上的優良份子，當然「一團和氣」，「笑口常開」，送出「熱烘烘」的暖氣來，而對於社會上的害馬則毫不留情，痛加殲滅，更何妨給以「冷冰冰」的寒氣？惟有這種人才能給予社會以眞正的熱情。我們需要眞疋的熱情，而不需要空虛的熱情！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>人家受痛苦，也像自己受痛苦一樣：所以，人家有了患難，應當設法替他們解除。</p>
<p>若因一次二次的失敗而頹唐消極的人，不是好漢。</p>
<p>若不計工作的效果，而只爲工作的報酬打算盤，則失去了工作的最大意義。</p>
<p>一個先哭　笑的人，能生活得有價值。</p>
<p>工作要有決心；而失敗在前面，成功在後面。</p>
<p>艱難是良藥，容易是毒藥。</p>
<h3>一月份徵文錄取第四名　我的生活</h3>
<p>— 羅鍾慶</p>
<p>在這旋渦中，時代是動盪的，波動的。</p>
<p>戰爭的結果是顚沛和破壞，和平的報酬是繁榮和建設。</p>
<p>戰爭，象徵着刦運的來臨，我的家庭是被燬滅了。它決不是像巴金的「家」崩潰的過程是內在的發展，而却是外在的打擊，當然道是無法避免的。我失去了幼時親暱的父母，失去了春意蓬勃的家庭，走向顚沛流離之途。</p>
<p>當都市的一角，由戰事轉到和平狀態的時候，我開始在芸芸衆生的羣中掙扎求生存，茫茫都市，沒有顯貴的親戚，更沒有有地位的友好，只有二個相依爲命的弟兄！</p>
<p>奮鬥的結果，我找到了一個職位，不管這個職位是怎樣的渺小，怎樣的輕蔑，總之，我已暫時解決幾點的困難：第一，在生活上暫時不致流浪。第二，在經濟上足以自食共力，不致再倚靠他人。</p>
<p>職業的對象是依靠質當爲業務的典當。用以獲取盈餘的方法，可說與銀行大同小異，一樣以利息來維持營業上的開支，不過在某種的形式上，有着顯著的不同罷了，例如銀行以抵押放款爲主要業務，而典當則以質押服飾爲要素。</p>
<p>提起典當，一向是被社會上人仕輕蔑和睥睨的，是的，在某點上雖是一種剝削貧苦者的塲所，但根據以調劑爲原則，那末仍不失它的半慈善性質；因爲需錢似燃眉之急的人們，在一籌莫展無法可想的當兒，質當究竟還是它的不二法鬥</p>
<p>主要的營業是質押服飾，因此我們所接觸的人，泰半係非富有者。他們好比抱了「有求必應」的心念，以及無窮的希望的寄託者來光顧，耳濡目染，不是悲慘訴着，便是嘮叨幫忙。假使雙方肯遷就的話，很少有口角發生。但到了贖取的時候，却有一種心理作用，以爲自己處於主宰的地位，視典當爲高利貸者，甚至辱駡動武亦時有可見，這類不幸事件是根本無法消弭的。</p>
<p>當北風凛冽的淸晨，溫度已在零度以下，人們還睡在被窩裏以求片刻的溫暖，或許還在追求圓夢，却想不到在外而已起了小小的波動：</p>
<p>「喂！贖當！」</p>
<p>「喔唷　今天好冷快點給我贖一贖！」更急地。</p>
<p>誰不貪溫暖？誰不高興在室內圍　促膝取暖？在這北風凛凛點水成冰的氣候中奔走，湊。了錢趕着把爲了食糧的威脅而致質當的衣服贖了，無非爲了抵禦刺骨的酷寒。</p>
<p>在米店高懸當局所發表本期配給數量時，靜穆路上已引起騷動，同時我們的營業上也起了變化：因爲一般以戶口米爲主要糧食的貧民，一時那裏能湊集整數的米價呢？於是典當遂被認爲暫時的調劑者，。</p>
<p>「喂！快點當一當！」</p>
<p>「給我當一當，去買戶口米囉！」</p>
<p>想不到僅敷半數之食糧，竟起熱烈的祈求。</p>
<p>但也有因購口糧，而致多支一筆利息的意外損失的每侃侃地說：「替你們當舖賺錢！」呀！當他們在說這句話的時候，也即我內心在自慚的時候。</p>
<p>服務了四五年，根據所得，加以分析，當戶大概分四類：</p>
<p>甲赤貧　佔50％；</p>
<p>乙隱貧　佔30％；</p>
<p>丙賭博及娛樂佔　15％；</p>
<p>丁其他　佔5％；</p>
<p>甲類：大都是有了早餐沒中餐的直正赤貧，以做勞力或小販者居多。</p>
<p>乙類：大都是一般薪水階級，因爲入不敷出，每月都要虧空一些，向友好借情面有關，難以啟口，况且借到與吾又是一個問題，只有出諸質當一法較爲便利，所以也很佔多數</p>
<p>丙類：這類是社會上唯一的點綴品，都市繁華的結果，賭博與娛樂自必跟踪而至。滬上儘多俱樂部，娛樂塲所，享樂主義者，自必更趨之若驚了</p>
<p>丁類。。這類包括各項少數因意外事件而致者。</p>
<p>上列比率並不固定，又因地處之不同而變更，譬如說：在南市，那末丙類要佔到百分之七八十之數。</p>
<p>有人說：「上海的繁華是建築於窮人身上的。」這句話是有相當的根據，，要往貧民區一週，或在街道的兩旁一巡，斗大的當」字觸目皆是，其比如櫛，這就是表示上海的富裕麼？不！決不！足以代表社會低層階級之需要。反之，也足以證明社曾經濟枯竭之一斑</p>
<p>所以，上海的繁華是建築於沙層之上的話，是不錯的！</p>
<p>（按瞿君現任典當職員）</p>
<p>我們讀書，終要以精熟爲貴。不求精熟，而但求速成，是讀書第一大病。好比吃東西，一味的食多，不加細嚼，結果　必致於積而不化，成爲食痞。由此我們可以知道，讀書的工夫，不在速成，只在綿密而不間斷。能不間斷，則一天所讀的雖然不多，或者有職業，事情忙的人，每天沒有多大的閒工多可以看書，只能忙里偷閒看一點，所看的當然很少，但是日積月累，久而久之，自然會有心得，自然會覺得有進步。假使刻刻求速，則刻刻只做一點潦草的工夫，儘管日誦五車，對於學問，有什麼　處？</p>
<h3>三言兩語集</h3>
<p>— 其午</p>
<p>儒家的克已，佛敎的慈悲，基督的博愛，……都是叫我們忘記「小我」，去除自私自利的心腸。</p>
<p>佛經上說：「無我得成於忍」。</p>
<p>能忍，然後能爲人听不能爲之事。</p>
<p>現代的國民不但要能够做到「無我」這一點，並且應該時時刻刻把「國家」和「民族」放在心目中。</p>
<p>奥爾珂特（A.　B.　Aloctt）說：「不知自己的無知，是息　最不幸的無知病」。</p>
<p>這句話，對一般自作聰明的人，眞是一記當頭棒喝！</p>
<p>但是，自作聰明的人却不會就此醒悟的。</p>
<p>「自尊」和「自誇」是截然不同的。</p>
<p>但是，一般人都不知「自尊」，而祇曉得「自誇」，並且把「自誇」當做了「自尊」</p>
<p>這恰和人們把「恭敬」和「諂媚」混亂了，把「自謙」和「自卑」顚倒了一樣。</p>
<p>差以毫釐，失之千里。從這裏可以很明顯地看出來。</p>
<h3>做小生意的</h3>
<p>— 天明畫</p>
<p>一得之言</p>
<h3>切戒一曝十寒</h3>
<p>— 棄疾</p>
<p>讀書的方法根多，有的注重專精；有的注重博覽：有的擇定了自己最感到興味的一個題目，凡是有關係的書籟，都要細心閱讀；有的漫無目標，遇到好書就看，興之所至，便剳錄下來。各人的方法雖然不同，但是如果要學問有進步，最要緊的一件事，還是要有恒心。</p>
<p>讀書和做別的事一樣，第一要有恒心。倘使一本書沒有看完，又看起別的書來，好比一樁事情沒有做完，又去做別的事情，東拉西扯，茫無頭緒，結果必定是　無功。會文正公曾經說過：一讀書記性平常，此不足慮，所慮者，第一怕無恒，……，可知無恒是讀書人的最大的仇敵。</p>
<h3>快樂</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>失敗是一切成功的開端。不要因失敗而灰心，若果失敗了，切不可使精神分散。過去的當它是死滅，未來是新的誕生。掙扎換得朝氣！創造纔有生命！從奮鬥刻苦中才能找尋到快樂。</p>
<p>快樂與痛苦是對待的，循環的。有快樂，也有痛苦。所以痛苦與快樂是五存的。若是沒有痛苦，快樂也無從眞實地存在着。</p>
<p>倘使以工作爲興趣，而不斤斤於成敗的得失，我想雖沒有空閒，也能有苦樂皆忘的快樂。何以呢？因爲一個人只要對自己所做的工作有興趣，把目己的心力集中在工作上，縱然沒有消遣，也能在工作上求得眞正的快樂！</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十六）</p>
<p>奇怪，在這種更深的意義上說，牠所已經變化的何等小。學生們客氣了些：恃　凌弱的舉動已經沒有；立誓與欺騙則更加多些。在師生之間，有了更爲眞實的友誼—一方面少了些誇大，一方面少了些虛僞。新敎師當中，有一個剛剛從牛津大學來的，甚至讓第六班的學生叫他的敎名。吉普斯不贊成這點；的確，他正有一些看小慣。「他也許竟會—呃哼—在學期報告單上簽署着—呃哼—「你的摯愛的吧—是小是？」他對人說。</p>
<p>在一九二六年的大罷工中，勃洛克菲爾德的　生用運貨汽車裝載着食物。這事過去以後，吉普期的情緒很受到擾動，　是戰事以後，所未曾有過的。某種事情　經發生了，牠最後的意義還得估計。不過有一點却是淸楚了：英國又在牠自己的火爐內燒起了火。這年的演講日，有一個美國客人來，他對於罷工使國家在金錢上所受的巨大損失，加以特別的注意，吉普斯回答脫。。「不錯，不過—呃哼上廣告—也總楚費錢的。」</p>
<p>「廣告？」　「唔，這不是—呃哼—廣告並且也不是—很好的廣告麼？整個一星期—呃哼—一個人也沒有死—一下槍也沒有放！貴國寗願—呃哼—在查抄一　店的事上—呃哼—流出更多的血</p>
<p>大笑大笑。不論他到什麼地方，說什麼話，總有大笑隨着。他已獲得笑話大家的盛名，大家都要聽他的笑話。不論何時，他在聚會的地方立起來說話、或者甚至他不過隔着桌子說話，大家總準備着心里與而孔，來等候他的笑話。他們用尋開心的心情來聽着，所以很容易使他們　足。他們有時在仙說　要　之前，就已經笑出來了。「老吉普斯的樣子很　錯，」他們以後會說。「眞是奇妙，他總能够看出事物的趣味來……。」　（四三）社會服務</p>

<h3>Essentials for Strengthening Price Controls</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, market prices in this city have reached unprecedented heights due to rumors and the black market. The Municipal Council has begun strict controls. However, since the weekend, price fluctuations have intensified, and the market has become more chaotic. Considering the difficult times, we feel compelled to offer our sincere advice to the authorities, hoping it will be beneficial for the future of the city's commercial situation. Moreover, this city remains the economic center of the peaceful area. If the price problem in this city can be resolved reasonably and satisfactorily, it will have a significant impact on the entire nation. The wartime economic policy outline can then be smoothly implemented, and the stability of national life during wartime will be beneficial to the country and a blessing for East Asia.</p>
<p>The authorities, based on principles, are taking necessary steps to control and stabilize prices, which is essential at this time. However, in our current difficult environment, various institutional conditions are inadequate, and fundamental price stabilization measures on all fronts are not easily improved. This inevitably causes some people to have doubts about the implementation of current price limits, such as production shrinking, materials being hoarded, or sources decreasing, black markets lurking, or market chaos and depression. These are all concerns that people cannot easily dismiss and require a reasonable solution. Based on the failed experiences of disparate price controls and localized control of a few commodity prices in various regions, theoretically, it is appropriate to implement comprehensive, consistent price limits across all regions and for all types of goods, maintaining a proper balance between price categories and regions. This would ensure that the price limit policy is thoroughly implemented. However, given the large number of goods and the complexity of prices, it is naturally difficult to achieve under the current environment and inadequate institutional conditions. Therefore, starting by selecting a few major items and consistently implementing price limits in key markets in each region, especially starting in this city as a model for the entire nation, cannot be said to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>The first problem that arises here is in the selection of price limit categories. Generally speaking, special attention should be paid to essential necessities for people's livelihood, such as the eight categories of grain, salt, cooking oil, cotton, cotton yarn, cloth, fuel, and paper, as well as transportation costs and wages. Within the unified price limit items, there should also be the intention of stabilizing commodity costs and adapting to local conditions. However, we must select the most commonly consumed major items or items with greater liquidity from each category and stipulate that consistent price limits must be implemented in all regions. This will make it easier to establish proper connections between regions for the implementation of price limits on these items and exert a leadership effect in stabilizing prices across regions. Secondly, if various prices differ too much between regions and fail to establish sufficient connections, materials will naturally flee from low-price areas to high-price areas, hindering the implementation of price limits in the low-price areas. Under today's transportation conditions, the impact of price fluctuations between regions may not seem significant, but neighboring markets are often places where material hoarding and black markets flourish. Therefore, the prices of important cities in various regions should be stabilized first, and then the prices of important small and medium-sized markets in their vicinity, or markets with closer economic ties, should be selected to ensure the stability of prices in various regions. We should use important cities in various regions as centers, and according to the traffic and market organization conditions in each region, delineate the important small and medium-sized markets in their vicinity or markets with closer economic ties as price limit areas belonging to the same category. In this way, on the one hand, it is easier to coordinate the implementation of price limits by controlling a few major commodity prices across the board to guide general prices in various regions. On the other hand, it is also easier to effectively implement price controls by adapting to the special conditions of various regions and gradually controlling various prices by region.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of price limits, how to select the standard for price limits and determine the price limits is also an important issue worthy of deep consideration. In recent years, price increases have been driven by rising commodity costs on the one hand, making it necessary to increase prices; on the other hand, supply has been unable to meet demand, and manipulation and speculation have caused prices to soar. The price limit policy can naturally allow the former to exist while遏制遏止the latter's upward trend, that is, limiting commodity prices must be based on cost as the standard. However, due to various factors, prices in various regions have already reached a state of disparity and disorder. The prices of the same item often vary greatly not only between regions but also within the same location and at the same time. At the same time, the factors constituting the cost of various goods vary in complexity, and their prices have an interlocking relationship, making it difficult to accurately estimate their true cost. In the past, price limits were based on the original prices of commodities in various markets on a certain date, which was naturally a decisive measure to avoid such complex problems and curb the current price increase trend. However, if a certain commodity price on this day is relatively low in a certain market, it will naturally be difficult to implement the limit on this low price. If another commodity price is particularly high after a period of soaring prices, allowing the existence of this high price will naturally hinder the implementation of other price limits. Therefore, the actual situation must be carefully considered and appropriately adjusted, reducing the overly high prices and appropriately increasing the overly low prices. At the same time, by referring to the prices of the main factors of each commodity, the cost can be estimated to roughly determine an objective standard. For local products, it is necessary to investigate the prices of the main cost factors of the price-limited goods during the six months before the implementation of the price limits when they are stable, estimate the production cost, add appropriate profits, and stipulate the production price or the wholesale price at the place of production. For imported products, the wholesale prices of the main producing areas or sources of the goods during the stable period in the six months before the implementation of the price limits should be added to the transportation costs to determine the import cost, and appropriate profits should be added to stipulate the wholesale price, that is, based on this wholesale price or the cost of goods from retailers, plus appropriate profits, to stipulate. However, the profit for wholesale and retail should not exceed 20% of the cost of the goods. Secondly, there should generally be no differential prices for various goods at the same time and place. If the same type of goods has different sources and different costs, in order to take into account the cost of the goods and encourage production sources, it seems necessary to use the actual cost of the goods or the higher cost as the standard for setting the maximum price limit. Under the maximum price limit, free trading is allowed. Although this may have the drawback of raising the prices of goods with lower costs, it can be restricted by another method of limiting profits. It can also be stipulated that the ordinary transaction price is set under the maximum price limit according to the different locations of the trading markets in various places to meet the needs of each trading market. Therefore, differential prices below the maximum price limit can exist. As for the prices approved by government material agencies for requisitioning and purchasing materials, and the prices of products from public enterprises, because the nature of operation and the role are different from the general public, or they are large-scale operations that do not count profits, or they have certain monopoly characteristics, or they are for the supply of military needs, or they are for adjusting market supply and demand, they do not necessarily need to be consistent with the price limits of general commercial goods. But in principle, they should be lower than this price limit. They can also, due to some special circumstances or to encourage the production source of goods, need to stipulate the minimum price limit of the goods. Due to the above facts, differential prices for the same type of goods in the same market in various places can still exist at the same time, which is a flexible way of using the price limit policy.</p>
<p>The above suggestions are nothing more than a gradual price limit policy. Its important feature is to gradually bring various prices in various regions to an appropriate balance, gradually establish sufficient connections between regions, and stipulate that price limits tend to be reasonable, so that all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce are sincerely convinced and thoroughly implement the price limit policy under considerable control. At present, the Municipal Council authorities, in view of past experience, have had to take decisive measures and quickly implement price limits for the price policy. During this period, some people will naturally suffer considerable losses, and some resistance will inevitably be encountered during implementation. But the most important thing is that we still hope that the authorities will strive to improve the implementation methods, on the one hand, it is necessary to widely carry out the official interpretation work of the price limit policy, so that all sectors understand the meaning of the price limit policy and reduce all resistance, and encourage assistance from various sectors of the public. On the other hand, it is necessary to try to avoid increasing the chaos in the market as much as possible, and minimize the losses and inconveniences of legitimate industrial and commercial circles. That is, arrests and fines, etc., must be based entirely on the law in order to increase public understanding and support. In extraordinary times, we certainly cannot but have extraordinary means, but extraordinary means must also be based on the laws of extraordinary times. Before the law, no one can engage in corruption and fraud, and no one can escape responsibility. Only in this way can the price limit policy be implemented and achieve satisfactory results.</p>

<h3>North Bank of the Yangtze River, Chongqing's Retreat Route Cut Off, Japanese Troops in Funing Reach Dongkan Town</h3>
<p>Hubei Front, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese aquatic motorized units have completely cut off the retreat route of the Chongqing troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The remnants of the Chongqing 118th Division, numbering about 3,000, have been largely annihilated after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese troops on the 17th and 18th. As of today, 1,500 corpses of the Chongqing troops have been identified, and 400 people have been captured. The Japanese troops also seized 45 light machine guns, 4 mortars, 700 rifles, and many other military supplies.</p>
<p>Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese dispatch army in central China announced at 10:00 a.m. today that the Japanese troops had completely surrounded and annihilated the four divisions of the Chongqing troops of the "Sixth War Zone" along the Yangtze River southeast of Shashi on February 17th and 18th.</p>
<p>Hubei Front, 21st (Central News Agency) Starting from the 15th, the Japanese Air Force, despite the poor weather for four weeks, carried out air raids over the Yangtze River near Liujiashi (10 kilometers southwest of Jianli) in southern Hubei Province, attacking the Chongqing troop boats attempting to cross the river. They strafed with machine guns and inflicted heavy damage. On the 16th, they cooperated with ground troops to attack Jianli, fiercely strafing the Chongqing troops' positions in the sky above the area. Another team of the Japanese Air Force fiercely bombed 500 Chongqing troops near Niujiashi who were trying to find a way to escape, and gave them a thorough blow. The Japanese Air Force is now closely cooperating with the ground army to expand the results of the war.</p>
<p>Hubei Front, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese army has achieved great results in the operation of fiercely attacking the Chongqing Dare-to-Die Army and the 118th Division in the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing, and is preparing for the next stage of the operation. The Chongqing Sixth War Zone camp has now been greatly shaken. The head of the Japanese army press team in the area today explained the significance of this operation by the Japanese army and the Japanese army's determination to defeat the Chongqing army, saying that this operation is the largest in the offensive operations of our dispatched army in China. Since the beginning of our offensive, the Chongqing army, which was entrenched in the southern end of the Bailu Lake position, has been cut off from its retreat by our southward troops. Therefore, the formation was greatly disrupted, and it collapsed and retreated. Chongqing Commander Peng Shan abandoned his 30,000 troops and fled to Linhu on the opposite bank. This also exposed the incompetence of the Chongqing army cadres and their low awareness of resistance. Now, our annihilation war has been completed, and we will establish an invincible posture in the next stage of the operation. Our army's morale is extremely high, and we are determined to move towards the goal of defeating the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing.</p>

By the evening of the 20th, they had defeated about 200 New Fourth Army soldiers and seized Batan (45 kilometers northeast of Funing), and then continued to advance eastward. The main force of the Japanese army that seized Dongkan Town also advanced eastward with the advancing Japanese troops. According to reports, although the remnants of the New Fourth Army's Third Division retreated to the vicinity of the old Yellow River estuary, the Japanese troops sealed off the coastline and are now implementing a thorough suppression war.

Mr. Lin first talked about his feelings about coming to Bengbu, saying, "Since I came here yesterday, my observations have shown that everyone is very supportive of the central government's policies. I think Bengbu has a history of 30 years since it was established. The history of Bengbu's establishment is also the history of the establishment of the Republic of China. Over the past 30 years, everyone has built a commercial port in the midst of difficulties and hardships, which is also the construction of the country by the people of the whole country in the midst of difficulties and hardships. Unfortunately, since the Republic of China, the country has been plagued by disasters. I hope that everyone will work hard in the spirit of hard work and perseverance to revive China and protect East Asia. I know that everyone supports the central government's policies, and I would like to express my respect to everyone. This is one of them. Also, yesterday evening, I came here and was warmly welcomed by all the gentlemen and young comrades. I really feel ashamed. For days, I have been ordered to go to various places to study ways to protect the country and revitalize Asia. You are not welcoming me personally, but you feel responsible for the great cause of saving China and protecting East Asia. The reason why you welcome me is also to welcome a young man who is willing to be with you forever and strive to save China and protect East Asia. With this in mind, while accepting your kindness, I more solemnly express that I am willing to follow you and dedicate my remaining life to the country and to East Asia. This is one of them." After talking about his feelings about coming to Bengbu, Minister Lin went on to express his views on the issue of participation in the war. Mr. Lin first gave a detailed analysis of the world situation in the past 300 years and the initiation of the recent peace movement, pointing out the enslavement of colored people, especially the enslavement of the people of East Asia, by British and American imperialists, and explaining the necessity of China's declaration of war on Britain and the United States in order to seek freedom and equality. Then, he gave a thorough explanation of the significance and certainty of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War from the military, economic, and spiritual strength aspects, and pointed out what strength China is using to participate in the war and what efforts should be made after participating in the war. China has 400 million people. As long as they are united and courageous, and make their greatest efforts in increasing production, saving consumption, and ensuring security, this effort is the strength of participation in the war. When Mr. Lin spoke to this point, he encouraged the people of the country to unite with a firm tone. As long as 400 million un-dead consciences are tightly combined into one heart, and 100 million East Asian people's consciences are tightly combined into one heart, we will be able to win victory.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Explains Ideal of Southern Construction - Satisfying War Requirements is the Top Priority - Vigorously Avoid Adopting a Passive and Short-Sighted Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Prime Minister Tojo, in the general budget meeting of the Diet on the 20th, reported and replied to the question raised by Diet member Nomura regarding the ideal of southern construction, meaning that the administration of the occupied territories in the south should take the satisfaction of operational requirements as the top priority. The central government has considered the position occupied by the south in the world in the future and vigorously avoided adopting a passive and short-sighted policy.

The future administrative methods have also been carefully studied to adapt to the progress of the war situation, so that there is no loss. As for the issue of military administration and civil administration, civil administration will be gradually changed whenever possible.</p>
<h3>Soviet Cavalry Surrounded in Donets Basin - Fierce Fighting in Orel Area - Soviets Heavily Damaged in Kursk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Unclear) - During their winter offensive, Soviet troops frequently deployed cavalry. However, modern warfare is different from the past. Military experts generally believe that cavalry should not be used on a large scale in modern warfare. The battles in the Donets region prove that this statement is indeed based on experience. The Soviets deployed a large number of cavalry in the Donets Basin and (unclear), reaching a crucial railway intersection before their rear was cut off by German mechanized units, ultimately being completely surrounded. The date of their annihilation is not far off. The central part of the Donets Basin remains under German control, with German forces launching multiple counterattacks, preventing the Soviets from launching large-scale offensives. The Soviet offensive in the Kharkov region has been thwarted. On Friday alone, the Soviets lost a total of thirty-five tanks in that area. (Unclear) also had small (unclear) military (unclear). The (unclear) force in the Orel area has increased. The situation on this route remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Soviet Border, 21st (Havas dispatch) - The weather on the Eastern Front is gradually (unclear). The surface is icy and snowy, starting to melt, making land operations even more difficult. However, the clear weather facilitates air force activity. Therefore, yesterday's battle situation on the Eastern Front was favorable to the German army. German aircraft constantly bombed Red Army positions and Soviet motorized units. According to Axis sources, German (unclear), especially dive bombers, inflicted heavy (unclear). In the north of the Eastern Front, the Red Army is reorganizing its troops, suffering heavy casualties due to German aircraft strafing at low altitude. As for the war situation in the (unclear) area, it is described separately as follows: (1) Donets area, still in (unclear), the Red Army, at the cost of heavy sacrifices, strengthening the pressure. The German side claims that one (unclear) of the Soviet cavalry has been completely surrounded and is about to be annihilated. (2) Kharkov area, the Red Army attempted to advance along the Kharkov-Poltava railway line in the Kharkov area, but failed. According to Soviet war reports, the Red Army has occupied Krasnograd east of Poltava and Pavlograd southwest of Losovaya. According to Axis sources, a large number of reinforcements have been transferred by the Red Army (unclear), making it possible for many German troops to be surrounded and isolated. (3) Western Kuban area, the Red Army launched offensives many times, but was repulsed by the German army and suffered heavy damage. (4) Around the city of Taganrog, fierce fighting is in full swing. The Red Army has already landed in the port of Novorossiysk. However, the German army is implementing sweeping battles on several high grounds and is quite successful. German aircraft bombed in all directions, inflicting heavy damage on the Red Army. (5) The Orel area, according to Berlin sources, the pressure from the Red Army is very fierce. Fierce fighting occurred between the two sides along the Orel-Kharkov railway. According to Soviet sources, the city of Obojan between Kursk and Kharkov has been recovered by the Red Army after a bitter battle. Yesterday, the German army launched a large-scale counterattack near the city of Kursk. The Soviet side also admitted that the German counterattack was fierce, causing heavy casualties to the Red Army. General Golikov's troops, advancing towards the city of Orel, were again blocked by the German army and changed to advancing westward, attempting to attack the Bryansk-Kharkov railway, so that area is also in fierce fighting. (6) Near Lake Ilmen and the Volkhov area near Leningrad, the Red Army is commanded by General Kulik and is engaged in fierce fighting with the German army. It is reported that the Red Army has shown signs of exhaustion in this battle. In short, the climate in several war zones on the Eastern Front is gradually warming up. Therefore, the transportation problem has become the most important issue in the current stage of the German-Soviet war. The purpose of the offensive launched by the Red Army is to cut off railway transportation at key points. Therefore, the Red Army wants to occupy several positions as soon as possible before the ground ice and snow melt, causing the war to (unclear) to a standstill.</p>
<p>Local War Unfolds in Novorossiysk</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Eastern Front, the war situation west of Rostov remains concentrated in the Matevev and Kursk areas.

According to German front-line news, two Soviet regiments in the coal-producing area south of Loshilo (unclear)grad have also fallen into the German encirclement and are about to be completely annihilated. As for the Novorossiysk area in the western Caucasus, local encounters have also unfolded. Because the German army has laid a large number of landmines and defended properly, there has been no change in the front line. At present, the Soviet army continues to maintain a three-sided encirclement posture, seemingly waiting for the opportunity for a decisive battle. A Reuters dispatch on the 20th also stated that the war situation of the Soviet army in Novorossiysk has not improved.</p>
<p>German Tanks and Aircraft Achieve Major Results</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - It was stated here yesterday that the German tank force led by General Knobelsdorff fought in various places on the southern route of the Eastern Front, (repeatedly overcoming major difficulties.

<p>Equipment in Kharkov Destroyed by Germans</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Mei You, a German war reporter who left Kharkov at the same time as the German rearguard, said that the Soviet army's occupation of Kharkov was only a nominal victory. All the city's important military equipment was completely destroyed by the German army before its retreat. In the last moments before Kharkov fell, with Soviet troops approaching the city, explosions could be heard in the city. All important equipment was completely destroyed to prevent it from being used by the enemy. As for the residential areas of the city, the German army did not damage them.</p>
<h3>Stalin Encourages Red Army Soldiers to Commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Red Army's Founding</h3>
<p>Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Moscow Telegraph, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party, issued Stalin's declaration on the 25th anniversary of the Red Army, encouraging Red Army soldiers to intensify training and cooperation and strictly abide by discipline, instructing civilians to work as usual to supply the front line with war equipment. This declaration was also sent to the coastal countries of Poland, stating that the Red Army's liberation of those countries is not far away.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The British "Statesman and Nation Weekly" commented on the Red Army's anniversary and said that the British should not forget that the Red Army occupies an extremely important position in the development of future wars. Although the British and Americans have tried to provide assistance in the sea and air forces, they have not yet achieved any significant results on land. The decision of the war should be based on the achievements of the army, which is why the Red Army's position is important.</p>
<p>German Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - German newspapers commented on the 25th anniversary of the Red Army. According to the People's Observer, the Red Army's only mission is to complete its international political aggression. This is what the Executive Committee of the Communist International repeatedly exhorted its party members to achieve, in order to create the Soviet Federal Republic. According to Stalin, "Our army is the army of the world revolution." The German General Assembly Report said that Trotsky's "permanent revolution" plan has not been able to satisfy Stalin's wishes. He uses extremely inhumane methods to use his army in an attempt to complete the revolution of the whole world and obtain a dictatorship.</p>
<h3>Spanish General Retires</h3>
<p>Madrid, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Officials announced today that General Trano, a famous general of the Civil War era, has retired. Trano once led troops to occupy Seville and Andalusia and led a military delegation to Italy, and once served as the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See. Trano reached the age of eighty-five on February 5th of this year.</p>
<h3>New Situation in the German-Soviet War - German General Staff Changes Strategy</h3>
<p>The German army finally withdrew from the cities of Rostov and Volokolomsk. The Donets Basin, an industrial area famous for producing pig iron and coal, was also recovered by the Soviet army, and the front line expanded again to the Ukrainian plains. Will the German army adopt the "planned retreat" policy at any time to prepare for its spring offensive? Regarding this matter, according to a special dispatch from Berlin obtained in Tokyo, the analysis is quite detailed.</p>
<p>German Army Planned Retreat</p>
<p>Since it is called a planned retreat, there should be a certain limit. What is the limit? Try to unfold a map of Ukraine, and you will know at a glance. On the vast frozen plains, artificial fortifications cannot stop the enemy's army. In a battlefield with inconvenient transportation, there is no other way to prevent large enemy forces except to defend with natural barriers. The German army, which has won many battles, may have overlooked this point. However, the German army is good at fighting and will not collapse completely due to this miscalculation. It can safely pass through the Caucasus and the Don River basin, planning to retreat to Ukraine. This strategy shows that it is a planned retreat, not a blind act. It is the German army's traditional strategy of (unclear).</p>
<p>German Army Human Resources</p>
<p>Western European soldiers who are used to the warm climate feel numb when they are in the minus twenty degrees Celsius cold zone. However, the enemy's mechanized units are equipped with winter clothing and are used to winter life. In this situation, if the German army is just vain and continues to resist without leaving, it may not be beneficial to Stalingrad, but it can put the Eastern battlefield to death. However, the German elite will inevitably be completely wiped out. The situation is so serious, with a strong enemy in front, and there will be many thorns in the future. The German General Staff, in view of this and in order to take care of the human resources of the motherland, had to employ the lives of soldiers, willing to endure temporary shame in order to seek future honor, and then made the decision to retreat.</p>
<p>The German General Staff has already begun to review how to defeat Soviet Russia from many new perspectives. The German-Soviet war has now entered a new stage. If the German General Staff still uses the old ideas of the past to fight, it will still be inevitable that the old strategy of gaining and losing, losing and gaining will result in both sides being hurt. If this is the case, it is in line with Britain's wishes, and the German military leaders are also well aware of this situation. What is noteworthy here is that the current Soviet offensive is the so-called "starvation offensive," exhausting its last strength in the hope of surviving.</p>
<p>What new tactics will appear in the future German offensive? No soldiers or experts dare to say anything, and even the lay strategists who usually talk nonsense do not dare to express (unclear) opinions. The calmness and silence in the rear show that the Germans deeply believe in their country's army and have no doubts.</p>
<p>Miscalculation of Red Army Strength</p>
<p>Military reporters also have reflections, knowing that they miscalculated the strength of the Soviet army, resulting in this result. At first, it was thought that it would be best to defend in winter, but it is feared that this plan is also wrong. The Soviet battlefield is vast, and the battle to seize its fixed land is a stupid strategy. If the enemy's military strength and firepower are not destroyed, it cannot be called war. Therefore, the German army's third offensive will change the strategy of targeting land in the past year, and it will focus all its efforts on destroying the enemy's fighting power. From this point of view, this retreat is to shorten the route (unclear) distance to lure the enemy deep into the Ukrainian plains, because Ukraine is a battlefield that is conducive to German operations, so that the climate can be warmed and lightning annihilation warfare can be used to break through the Soviet army. Marshal Goering, the editor-in-chief of the nationalist newspaper Hubelin (transliteration), once wrote an article in his impassioned tone to review the new German offensive. The following is an introduction to its outline:</p>
<p>Quantity is More Important than Quality</p>
<p>Last year's German summer offensive and the current Soviet winter offensive have been major lessons for us. In the Eastern battlefield, the Soviet Union not only has excellent tactics and sophisticated weapons, but also focuses on quantity rather than quality, pouring countless massive armies and massive weapons to influence the trend of the war. The enemy comes with violent means, so we can only (unclear) towards with violent means to (unclear) down the enemy. The goal of national mobilization is also here. At present, we are preparing for the future offensive, so we are gathering more troops than Stalin and more weapons than the enemy. Then we can achieve the final victory.

<h3>Tunisian Axis Forces Continue to Sweep American Troops</h3>
<p>British Forces Halt Offensive Due to Sandstorms; French Forces in the Central Region Also Retreat</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities described the battle situation in Tunisia on the 20th, stating in essence that the Axis forces are continuing to sweep up the remaining enemy troops in the central lowlands of Tunisia and the southern part of the Atlas Mountains, and are advancing westward. Apart from fierce fighting northwest of Sbeitla and Kasserine, they have broken through enemy positions. American troops are retreating towards Tébessa. However, French rebel forces in the mountainous positions near Kasserine are still resisting stubbornly. The anti-Axis forces have suffered heavy losses in this operation, with over three thousand American and British soldiers captured. The exact number of captured weapons and military supplies is still being determined. However, most of the American 1st Armored Division and the 2nd Infantry Division have been annihilated. Each division has lost its value as an independent unit. Furthermore, on the southeastern border of Tunisia, the reconnaissance units of the British Eighth Army are still attempting to maneuver, seemingly trying to avoid large-scale combat. Enemy infantry in the southern area are attempting to break through a corner of the Axis defenses, but due to the Axis forces' echeloned positions and difficult terrain, they have made no progress whatsoever.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced the battle situation on the 20th: (1) Tunisian Front: The vanguard units of the army have launched operations; (2) On the morning of the 18th, an Italian submarine attacked an enemy convoy sailing in the western Mediterranean Sea, hitting one transport ship with a torpedo.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - General Montgomery of Britain, after ordering the British Eighth Army to launch an offensive against the Axis front in southern Tunisia on the 18th, has now ordered a halt to the advance. The British side claims that this is due to strong winds and sandstorms affecting military operations, thus the offensive was stopped. In reality, Montgomery may have suffered heavy losses in the initial two days of attacking the Mareth Line, forcing him to cease operations. Currently, the British right flank in the coastal area is redeploying artillery to the Medenine positions. Their left flank has only reconnaissance activity. French forces in eastern Tunisia are also retreating along with the American troops. This is because the positions held by the French troops in the Pichon area west of Kairouan are threatened by the Axis advance. There were no major battles in North Africa yesterday. The American rearguard is still stationed on the high ground of the Atlas Mountains, but the main force of the American Fifth Army has retreated to the Tébessa area and is currently reorganizing. The Axis forces now have great freedom to advance south and north. Since the Allied forces lost three airfields between Thala and Kasserine, the Axis advance and coastal communications lines are no longer threatened by enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Alexander Arrives at the Front Lines</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) - A Reuters reporter with the North African Allied Forces Headquarters reports that German reconnaissance teams attacked the flanks of the Allied forces' new defensive line last Friday. The Allied forces' new defensive line is located behind Thala and Kasserine and along the western bank of the Ousseltia River. The German forces have gained a 120-mile wide area in that direction. Also, the Allied Deputy Commander, Alexander, arrived at the Tunisian front three days ago to command all forces.</p>
<p>British Forces Cover Retreat as Rearguard</p>
<p>Bern, 20th (Havas Agency) - Yesterday's battles on the central Tunisian front were limited to patrol engagements. According to British and American sources, the majority of American troops have now retreated from the Ousseltia River basin. British forces are acting as the rearguard during the retreat. According to British sources, British troops hastily engaged the enemy within half an hour, and British soldiers attempted to stop German tank columns from advancing from Kairouan to Pichon, having been awake for three nights. In southern Tunisia, Axis forces and Anglo-American forces made contact at Bou Gada and near the Axis positions on the Mareth Line, not far from Medenine. The British forces continued to advance, but progress was greatly slowed by the widespread laying of mines by General Rommel's troops. However, the vanguard units have already begun operations, and a major battle is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>American Troops Retreat in Disorder</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (United Press)</p>
<p>War correspondent Gursch, returning from the North African front, described the defeat of American troops in central Tunisia, saying that three days ago, our forces launched an attack on the American troops at dawn. Before dawn, our tank columns had already occupied narrow mountain passes and penetrated deep into enemy strongholds. The enemy, barely recovering from their shock, soon discovered that most of their artillery and tanks had been destroyed. American soldiers not only lacked combat experience, but many deserted on the battlefield. Therefore, the battle was not intense. Even American tanks, which were numerically superior, often dared not charge. Our forces extensively broke through American defenses on the first day of the offensive. By the second day, the American troops began a rescue counterattack, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to statistics from the American magazine "Editor &amp; Publisher," the casualty rate of American war correspondents is even higher than that of the American army. On average, ten out of every hundred war correspondents are killed in action, twenty-six are wounded or missing, and about twenty-two are captured or detained.</p>
<p>Newspaper Commentary: The North African Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The Mainichi Shimbun said today that we had long anticipated that the Allied forces in North Africa would inevitably fall into difficulties. This defeat has completely thwarted their plan to invade Europe. The defeat occurred after an American general took office as the commander-in-chief in North Africa, further exposing American incompetence. The Asahi Shimbun also stated that although unfortunately the Axis powers lost Tripolitania, Tunisia's position is even more important than the former.</p>
<p>Train Derailment in Constantine</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Havas Agency) - According to the Stefani Agency, an enemy train in North Africa, loaded with munitions, was traveling east from Algeria towards the Tunisian front when it derailed near Constantine, ten miles from Guelma. The entire train exploded, and all the escorting troops were killed. It is said to have been an act of sabotage. The dissenting French faction and American authorities have arrested many local people near Guelma.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas Agency) - After American aircraft bombed the holy city of Kairouan in Tunisia, the Bey of Tunisia has donated 50,000 francs to General Esteva, the Resident-General, asking him to distribute it to the refugees.</p>
<h3>Italian Military Communiqué</h3>
<p>Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Today, the Italian Supreme Command announced a communiqué stating that yesterday, in southern Tunisia, there was a fierce engagement between tank units on both sides. With the assistance of aircraft, the advance of the enemy was halted. The Italian forces also bombed Tripoli and Beirut, destroying military depots and oil depots. Enemy aircraft raided Naples, causing slight damage to buildings and resulting in 119 deaths and 332 injuries among the residents. Palermo was slightly damaged by enemy aircraft bombing. Four enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3>American Troops' Inadequate Equipment Led to Defeat – Alabama Senator Calls for Attention to This Issue</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Havas Agency) - Washington dispatch: Senator Bankhead of Alabama recently told the press that the country's army should reduce manpower and resources in order to increase the production of ammunition and food. Judging from the defeat of American troops in Tunisia this time, it can be seen that our army is operating extremely unfavorably. The number of soldiers killed in action is in the thousands, all due to the lack of adequate equipment. Therefore, this issue must be resolved immediately.</p>
<h3>Indian Leaders Petition Governor-General Calling for Release of Gandhi - Mahatma's Fast Has Reached a Critical Point - Washington Concerned, Hull Has Consulted with British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Allied News Agency) - According to a New Delhi dispatch, prominent figures in Indian political circles have launched a joint petition to the Governor-General, demanding the immediate and unconditional restoration of Gandhi's freedom. Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, also signed the petition yesterday. The petition has been sent to the Governor-General, and copies have been telegraphed to British Prime Minister Churchill, Secretary of State for India Amery, and American President Roosevelt's representative in India, Phillips.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 21st (Allied News Agency) - Reuters reports that Gandhi's twenty-one-day fast has reached a critical point on the eleventh day today. A mass meeting of 17,000 people was held in New Delhi yesterday, demanding the unconditional release of Gandhi. This demand has been delivered to Indian Governor-General Linlithgow.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the White House is very concerned about Gandhi's fast. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Halifax held a meeting yesterday to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to observations from well-informed sources here regarding the current political situation in India, Gandhi's health has deteriorated significantly by the eleventh day of his fast. A New Delhi broadcast stated that the authorities in Bombay announced today that Gandhi's physical strength is weakening, and his pulse also indicates weakness. His health has deteriorated considerably. Gandhi's personal physician also said that his health is quite serious.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 21st (Central News Agency) - Based on the opinions of well-informed sources here observing the current political situation in India, it is generally believed that when Gandhi issued his declaration of a twenty-one-day fast, he stated that it was decided after considering his physical strength. If Gandhi were to die as a result of this, the Governor-General's office would face the most severe crisis. However, judging from the Governor-General's previous acceptance of the resignation of the three members, it can be seen that he already has the intention of decisively challenging. Therefore, there may be a total resignation of the Indian Executive Council in the future. However, it is difficult to predict who will be appointed as mediator and in what form the mediation will be conducted. However, the possibility of a compromise has not been completely abandoned.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a New Delhi dispatch, Gandhi's health is deteriorating daily after having fasted for half of his scheduled fast. Gandhi's relatives, concerned about any eventuality, have all gone to the Aga Khan Palace, but they have been refused entry by the British-Indian authorities. It is rumored that Gandhi's youngest son, Devdas Gandhi's planned visit has also been canceled.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Sentiment Among Indians is Intense</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Anti-British sentiment among the Indian people is intensifying. According to a New Delhi dispatch, a new conflict has occurred in Sindh between British officials and the Hurs. One Hur leader has died as a result, and many Hurs have been arrested. Furthermore, British officials in Karachi have offered a reward of 5,000 rupees each for the arrest of three escaped Hur leaders.</p>
<h3>Ceylon Permits Display of Soviet Flag</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - According to a Colombo dispatch, the Soviet flag will be allowed to be displayed in Ceylon. The order prohibiting the display of the Soviet flag in July 1940 has now been revoked.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Promulgates Edict: Citizens of German Descent are Exempt from Obligations Upon Leaving for Germany</h3>

<h3>On Gele Mountain</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Fen</p>
<p>Housing Shortage and Difficulty in Hiring</p>
<p>Gele Mountain, in the suburbs of Chongqing, amid the lush forests, is seeing new Western-style houses being built every day. However, as wealthy merchants and the families of dignitaries continuously move in from Chongqing, the houses on the mountain are already full. Renting a house is as difficult as climbing to the heavens, and hiring a maid is also proving tricky. As a result, competition has emerged. Whoever dares to offer a higher price can easily hire a maid. Those on fixed incomes suffer the most. Their money is only a fixed amount each month, but prices are soaring like eagles. Hiring help has become unaffordable. I have a friend whose husband and wife both work in the same organization, earning over 900 yuan per month. They need to eat, socialize, have pocket money, and also hire help. After various deductions, they can only afford a wage of 60-70 yuan per month. This time, I saw them with a real headache. A maid was hired for less than a few days and demanded a raise, constantly comparing herself to others, saying, "The Wang family on the mountain only has four people, but they hired a nanny for 150 yuan per month, plus extra money for errands, tips for odd jobs, and tips for delivering gifts to relatives and friends. She can earn a hundred yuan or so a month. Aunt Pan in the Yang Mansion only takes Mrs. Yang's two children to school and picks them up after school, does some laundry, and doesn't even have to cook. For such light work, she earns 120 yuan a month." Thus, I often see my friend worrying about hiring a maid. When the maid leaves, the wife has to take leave from work to cook and take care of the children herself.</p>
<p>Can't Buy Pork</p>
<p>Small civil servants and elementary school teachers' families, who must eat vegetarian food for six days a week, also want to eat meat and taste some meat on Sundays, or casually invite a guest or two. For this, they have to sacrifice two hours of sweet morning sleep, and in the time when the starlight is about to disappear, throw themselves into the light gauze of the mountain fog and run towards Gaodianzi. Not only the residents near Gele Mountain are like this, but also the people far away in Heshangpo often have to walk this path.</p>
<p>In the meat market, the weak light hanging next to the meat is still swaying uncertainly, and a stream of people has already surged in front of the market gate, crowding and fighting. Whether it's fatty or lean, as long as they can buy it, they walk away proudly. Sometimes, buyers quarrel loudly because the sellers are unfair. If you can only buy one or half a jin of meat, you can't even dream of buying it after standing there for half a day. You can only sigh at the pile of meat that has already been reserved by customers who can afford high prices. The cunning and profitable butchers only value those who buy more. They are doing the emperor's business, showing contempt towards customers who buy little meat.</p>
<p>"There's no more meat! This meat has been reserved, what are you doing touching it?" The customer who shouted about buying one or half a jin of meat touched a large piece of meat on the hook, feeling a little reluctant to let go.</p>
<p>"Alas! They should have slaughtered a few more pigs on Sunday. I made a wasted trip and couldn't buy even a slice of fatty meat. What bad luck!" One or two weak sighs disappear into the scattered flow of people.</p>
<p>The Landlord's Clever Calculation</p>
<p>The landlord's calculation is really good. The house has been sold successfully. Judging from the appearance of the Western-style house, it is already quite old. Many holes have peeled off the ceiling, and several cracks have appeared in the walls. The wall holes have become the home of mice, and the kitchen is even more leaking. The landlady often tells us that carpenters are not easy to find, so the house has not been properly repaired. In fact, carpenters and plasterers can be called, the problem is that they are preparing to sell the house, and they are trying to save money.</p>
<p>Five years ago, they only spent 700 yuan to buy this house, and now they have sold it for 20,000 yuan. In addition to the three rooms they live in without spending money, they also rent out the side wing. The rent in the past was a little less, but 1,000 yuan a year can be obtained. The landlord doesn't do any errands now. With this 20,000 yuan, they can live well. (Posted on December 20th, Year 31)</p>
<h3>Argentine President Declares: Neutrality Must Be Maintained - This War Has Nothing to Do with Argentina - Will Never Change Current Status</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Argentine President Castillo stated to the press yesterday that Argentina's neutrality must be maintained under any circumstances.

<h3>Intense Undercurrents Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Britain and the United States are constantly engaged in open and covert struggles. There are three areas of world interests that Britain and the United States have recently been vying for: (1) the issue of building new ships, (2) the issue of the United States purchasing bases, and (3) the expansion of global civil aviation. Regarding the first issue, Britain, due to the fact that many ships have been sunk by German submarines, is demanding that the United States increase production. However, it is very dissatisfied that the United States has so far failed to fulfill its promise to build new ships. Regarding the second issue, now that the United States has seized some naval and air force bases, the United States has again instructed radio stations and newspapers to demand the lease of all British bases. As for the third issue, Britain and the United States are currently fiercely arguing over it. The United States' intention is clearly to use the name of civil aviation to establish bases.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Newspaper Refutes American President's Speech</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Havas Agency) - U.S. President Roosevelt recently gave a speech in which he talked about building democratic systems in Portugal and Spain, which was strongly protested by the authoritative newspaper "Diário de Manhã" here in an editorial. It stated briefly, "Our country has abandoned the concept of a democratic government since 1926. Seventeen years of experience have proven that our country has benefited greatly from the current administrative system. As for Spain, the government of Head of State Franco is also extremely consolidated. Therefore, there is absolutely no intention for Portugal and Spain to revert to the old system."</p>
<h3>U.S. Implements Food Rationing - Establishes Rationing Committee</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - The United States has established a "Rationing Committee" in Washington to allocate the supply of food. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wickard announced the establishment of the committee, saying that the nation's need for food has greatly increased, while the supply of important goods is limited. Therefore, there is the establishment of this committee. The committee will determine the rationing standards based on the urgency of the needs. Afterwards, the U.S.'s control over food will become more strict.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Havas Agency) - According to a New York dispatch, the United States will implement rationing of food and clothing from March 1, totaling more than 200 items, and will issue Ration Book No. 2 to the people on that day. It is said that canned fish and canned meat are among them.</p>
<h3>Internal Chaos in U.S. War Production Board</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The U.S. government has repeatedly sought to improve its wartime production mechanism, but has not yet achieved results, which has greatly affected the production of military supplies. Recently, the Daily Express reported on the internal chaos of the U.S. War Production Board, the supreme body for military supply production, as follows: The struggle between War Production Board Director Nelson, Rubber Director Jeffers, and the highest authorities of the Army and Navy has recently become increasingly fierce. In order to resolve the situation, Roosevelt may establish a supreme body to govern military supply production. However, the War Production Board was originally established as the supreme governing body for military supply production. Therefore, it is likely that Nelson will resign in the future.</p>

<h3>The Philippines Begins Implementing Policies to Revitalize Industry, Purchasing Important Agricultural Products to Alleviate People's Suffering, and Increasing Cotton Planting to Achieve Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Manila, 21st (Central News Agency) Since the implementation of military administration in the Philippines, a year has quickly passed. Its economic development, with the aims of suiting the purposes of the Greater East Asia War and stabilizing the people's livelihood in the Philippines, has now gradually entered the great stage of thorough rectification. In the past, the fundamental policy of the United States regarding economic encroachment on the Philippines was to exploit Philippine agricultural products and other materials to maintain its domestic industry and labor, and to dump surplus commodities from within the country into the Philippines to replenish resources. Therefore, the more surplus commodities it exported, the greater the exploitation of Philippine agricultural products. Consequently, it would only help develop Philippine agriculture if it did not harm American interests. However, its domestic sugar and oil refining industries still clashed with the Philippine sugar and coconut oil industries. This is because the United States is both an industrial country and has abundant agricultural products. The agricultural incentive policies implemented by the United States after it occupied the Philippines clearly failed. When the Philippines was trapped by heavy taxation, an economic panic occurred. At that time, the Greater East Asia War broke out. After Japan occupied Manila on January 2nd, it immediately began to resolve the suffering of the Philippine people, such as promoting a food production increase movement to ensure the Philippine people's food supply and prevent illegal price increases, rapidly rebuilding land transportation, and restoring industry to relieve unemployed workers. All of this was not only laying the foundation for the future implementation of military administration but was also seeking the welfare of the Philippine people in every way. Currently, it is beginning to re-organize industries, which is also the appropriate path for the Philippines' future development. The following policies are included:</p>
<p>First, purchasing surplus agricultural products such as sugar, coconut oil, and Manila hemp directly at high prices to alleviate the people's suffering. Second, to establish a self-sufficient food system to prevent the dumping of foreign rice, Japanese excellent agricultural technology is being used to guide and greatly increase food production. A coconut drying increase plan is currently being implemented to revive the coconut industry, the largest agricultural industry in the Philippines. After the coconut drying harvest, it is quickly transported by rail to Manila and delivered to oil refineries to be made into soap and oil, which are essential daily necessities. The Philippines was originally an excellent cotton planting area, but it could not develop due to the United States' implementation of policies to protect its domestic industry. Now, large-scale cotton planting is being implemented to maximize land use and ensure self-sufficiency in Philippine cotton production. It is expected that, with Japanese excellent technology and enthusiastic Philippine cooperation, the quality of cotton production will definitely not lag behind American cotton. Regarding tropical specialties such as castor beans and "dere-si-su" (transliteration of a plant name, used as an insecticide), the Philippines was originally also abundant in these products, but later, due to the selfish agricultural policies of the United States, they were imported from other places, resulting in a gradual decline in production. Now, it is also planned to increase them together and fully restore Philippine industries to increase the production of essential daily necessities. At the same time, factory facilities from mainland Japan are being moved to the Philippines to supplement the Philippines' industrial production capacity and stabilize the people's livelihood in the Philippines. It is expected that, with the cooperation of the Philippine people, all these policies will definitely reap the expected great results, benefiting the Philippine people and making significant contributions to obtaining essential materials for the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Germany Adopts Newly Invented War Tool at the Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) Today, reliable sources revealed that the newly invented scientific war tool adopted by the German army on the Eastern Front involves installing sound and light emitters in the troops. Practical application has yielded satisfactory results, and it is most effective in resisting Soviet artillery units. It is estimated that from the start of the Eastern Front war to January 1943, the German army used this new war tool to destroy as many as 48,841 Soviet artillery positions. According to German inspections, the German artillery was able to destroy 20,445 Soviet artillery positions.</p>

<h3>Authorities Determine to Distribute Coarse Grain, Oil, and Sugar Purchase Certificates Starting Today. Quantities and Prices Will Be Announced Soon. Rumor Has It That Oil and Sugar May Each Be Half a Catty Per Month. Coarse Grains Are Still Being Processed, and the Types Have Not Been Officially Decided.</h3>
<p>In order to fully maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents, the authorities, after the effective implementation of rationing grains according to population, have consulted with the Oil Industry Wholesale Office and the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office under the military allocation authorities to implement rationing of edible oil and sugar. Starting today, the Public Concession authorities will issue the eighth batch of rice and flour purchase certificates and, at the same time, issue the first batch of extra coarse grain certificates, the first batch of edible oil certificates, and the first batch of edible sugar certificates. The distribution period, quantity, and price of coarse grain, edible oil, and sugar certificates will be announced separately according to the methods used for rice and flour certificates.</p>
<p>Methods for Claiming Various Certificates</p>
<p>The extra first batch of coarse grain certificates and edible oil certificates are in the form of first and second duplicate tickets, and the edible sugar certificate is in the form of the No. 1 ticket. Taxpayers can go to the designated certificate issuing offices on the dates specified on the back of the winter property tax bill to claim the certificates in order to purchase essential food items such as rice, flour, coarse grains, edible oil, and sugar. Children under the age of fourteen and people with any skin diseases are not allowed to go. At the same time, when claiming the certificate, each taxpayer must report the number of Chinese permanent residents, adults and children, residing in the house listed on the receipt. If there are any errors or false reports in the reported number, not only will the certificate claiming time be delayed, but penalties will also be imposed.</p>
<p>Purchasing Special Rations with Certificates</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Shanghai News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources that the municipal oil and sugar rations were approved by the military allocation authorities and distributed to the edible oil industry wholesale offices and the sugar merchants' cooperative business offices. These two offices then (1) distribute the certificates to the registered retailers according to the prescribed methods for sale; (2) grant special rations for businesses that require them for business purposes. Regarding the rationing of food according to population, except for the Public Concession including the Hongkou area and the French Concession, where the Concession authorities issue oil and sugar certificates and purchase from designated retailers, the rationing in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and other places is handled by each area itself according to the baojia system to issue purchase certificates for purchasing food.</p>
<p>Oil and Sugar Quotas May Be Half a Catty Each</p>
<p>Regarding the quantity of oil and sugar to be rationed per capita, it will be determined based on the total monthly amount approved by the military allocation authorities, after deducting the quantity of special rations for various industries, and then calculating the quantity to be rationed per capita each month according to the city's population. As for the amount of ration approved by the military allocation authorities this month, it is 20,000 sacks of edible oil and 25,000 sacks of sugar. It is heard that the agencies in charge of rationing will ration oil and sugar once a month, and edible oil will be rationed twice a month. The monthly quantity rationed per capita may be half a catty for both oil and sugar, the same for adults and children. The price will be in accordance with the price limit set by the military allocation authorities, and purchases will be made with certificates.</p>
<p>Simultaneous Implementation in Garrison Areas</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Shanghai municipal government's Materials Control Department has already begun the procedures for rationing oil and sugar according to population, and it has been decided to implement it starting on March 1st. Nanshi and the Hubei District are still handled by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Office and the Edible Oil Wholesale Office, assisted by the police sub-bureaus and fangbao chiefs under their jurisdiction. It will also be implemented simultaneously starting on March 1st. As for the naval garrison area, according to the Sixth Baojia District, preparations have also been completed, with the assistance of the bao and li chiefs to handle household surveys and other matters. The implementation period is expected to start simultaneously with the aforementioned dates.</p>
<p>Nanshi Considers the Quantity of Sugar Distribution</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that regarding the sugar distribution in Nanshi, all the district public offices in the area have been prepared and are waiting for implementation to universally alleviate the serious threat of sugar shortages for the residents of the area. Although the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has tentatively decided to implement it starting on the first day of next month, the quantity of sugar to be distributed per person is currently being earnestly discussed with relevant parties. Although the rumor that each person can receive half a catty of sugar is not entirely unfounded, considering the current situation, there may be a further reduction. According to unofficial sources yesterday, the quantity of sugar to be distributed is only four ounces. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office is still carefully considering this, so it cannot yet be regarded as a finalized decision.</p>

<h3>Middle School Students Hold Pro-War Speeches, Organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Literary Association</h3>
<p>Since the National Government and Chairman Wang announced the declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year, national sentiment has been high. There is a deep understanding of the suffering from British and American imperialism for over a hundred years and the significance of our country's participation in the war. However, the most important aspect of implementing the Greater East Asia War is promoting cultural work. In order to raise awareness among middle school students in the city about the truth of China's participation in the war and promote middle school students' study of Japanese, the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has decided to hold a pro-war speech contest for Shanghai middle school students on March 30th, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, for the purpose of propaganda and celebration. The speeches will be mainly in Japanese, and the topics are free to choose. The participating schools plan to submit them to the relevant authorities for approval. It is heard that the branch has separately sent letters to Director Lin of the Shanghai Education Bureau and Director Ueno of the Education Department of the Public Concession, requesting them to instruct the middle schools under their jurisdiction to comply. Any middle schools that wish to participate may report to their respective authorities in advance.</p>
<p>Special Edition on Various Regions of Nanyang - No. 3</p>
<h3>The Philippines Past and Present (4)</h3>
<p>— Voters</p>
<p>(5) Fundamental Obstacles to Philippine Independence: Due to the existence of feudal remnants in agriculture—a system brought by Spain that has poisoned the Filipino people for more than 300 years, due to the poverty of farmers and the low level of civilization (level of people's civilization and wealth), the poor farming techniques, and the lack of national capital, these many economic reasons form the main obstacles to Philippine independence. American rule in the Philippines is strengthening these obstacles. For example, the allocation system for exports to the United States, the progressive tax system, and the exchange rate of one dollar to two pesos have all deepened the abnormal development of Philippine agricultural productivity, the low productivity of agricultural labor, high production costs, and the currency system of one dollar to two pesos have created high prices for Philippine goods. Besides relying more on the United States, it is difficult to compete in other countries' markets. Therefore, except for American investors and a very small number of Philippine farmers, the vast majority of people are bound to production that is irrelevant to national development. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that investments in export agriculture are in the hands of foreigners. Foreign capital monopolizes export profits. Philippine capitalists themselves use the income from agricultural exports to purchase expensive American goods. As a result, the accumulation of national capital is insufficient, and the commercial sector has always been in the hands of overseas Chinese and other foreigners. Commercial capital cannot be transferred to industrial capital to develop the national economy of the Philippines.</p>
<p>(6) Immature Industry: The lack of industrial maturity, the lack of modern industry (productive sectors), is most sufficient to show the backwardness of the Philippine economy. Philippine industry is no more than sugar refining, coconut oil, rope making, cement, hat making, alcohol industry, button and embroidery industry, processing of agricultural products; it is still in the home industry stage. For example, in the sugar refining industry, there are 46 pressing fields, but only 4 refining factories; refined sugar only accounts for 5% of the sugar export amount; and the tobacco industry is also mainly based on handicrafts, and cigarettes must be imported from the United States. In terms of the textile industry, it cannot develop due to its dependence on American cotton. Shockingly high interest rates have also become a factor hindering industrial development. In recent years, the Philippine government has been striving to promote industrialization under the demand for economic independence, but it has been frustrated by the European War and the active preparations of the United States in the Pacific.</p>
<p>(7) Mining Dominated by Foreign Capital: The main industry in the Philippines and an element for future recovery is mining. In the past, it was also under the subordination of the United States, and 80% was dominated by foreign capital. The most developed gold mine. Of the total investment of 120 million pesos, 35% belongs to the American system, 25% belongs to the British system, and 7.5% belongs to the Spanish system. Various mineral deposits such as gold, iron, copper, manganese, and chromium are in an undeveloped state. But buried mineral products, in addition to the above, also include silver, tin, lead, zinc, coal, etc., and non-ferrous metals include salt, petroleum, lime, asbestos, marble, gypsum, and guano. According to the main mineral resources of the Philippines announced by the Japanese government on January 24, 1942, they are (1) iron ore, 701,000 tons were exported in 1939, most of which were exported to Japan, and the reserves are extremely rich, (2) chromium ore, 102,000 tons were exported in 1929, of which 54,000 tons were exported to the United States, and the reserves are 10 million tons. Known as the world's number one. (3) Copper ore, with reserves of 5 million tons. (4) Manganese, 49,000 tons were exported in 1938, most of which were exported to Japan.</p>
<p>Philippine mining is different from agriculture and is not very dependent on the United States. In the past, it had a closer relationship with Japan, and it is easier to develop in the future. According to 1399 figures, 399% of iron ore, 599% of copper ore, 563% of refined copper, 10% of chromium, and 65% of manganese were exported to Japan. This point is noteworthy.</p>
<p>The Impact of the Fall of the Philippines on the United States</p>
<p>American imperialism has forever lost its suzerainty in the Philippines. Economically, the Philippines has to endure great pain for the time being. This is the result of years of American rule. From the above-mentioned great dependence of the Philippines on the United States, it can be imagined. However, the impact of losing the Philippines on the United States is even more serious. Some people think that the Philippines is a burden to the United States, and there is no pain in losing it, just like cutting off a wart on the neck! There is some truth to this. According to the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, in order to facilitate the independence of the Philippines and reduce its dependence on the United States, the United States implemented a distribution system and a tax system on Philippine exports to the United States, which had always been freely traded and imported into the United States without tax. However, in reality, it was the result of competition between Cuban, Hawaiian sugar and coconut product exporters to the United States and Philippine merchants. It was implemented to rescue and maintain American investors in the above-mentioned export industries in Cuba and Hawaii. That law also restricted immigration to the United States, ostensibly to prepare for Philippine independence, but actually to prevent Filipinos from moving to the United States and intensifying the unemployment panic in the United States! Moreover, the Independence Act did not involve monetary autonomy and the autonomy of trade with third countries, and it also required that the United States Navy be allowed to use it as a base after independence. However, purely from an economic point of view, American financial expenditures on the Philippines and trade payments account for a considerable and huge figure, which is tantamount to a burden. It may be more cost-effective to give up the Philippines. American agricultural capitalists and exporters from Cuba and Hawaii especially support allowing Philippine independence for this reason. Similarly, it can also explain why the United States lacks enthusiasm for the operation and development of the Philippines, and even the investment in the Philippines does not account for a huge amount. Because in the strategy of imperialism to control colonies, the point that distinguishes the United States from the public is that it does not take the form of extreme exploitation, but implements benevolent control. The fundamental reason is that the domestic market in the United States is still very large. Although it has been striving to expand overseas since 1920, the traditional domestic market first doctrine still survives. But is the United States willing to completely abandon the Philippines, and will there be no damage to the United States after the loss of the Philippines? That is not entirely the case, and it is the opposite.</p>
<p>Because the Philippines is the only military and economic base of the United States in Asia. This can be clearly understood by looking at the past desires of the United States for Asia, especially by looking at the formation of the ABCD line before the Greater East Asia War. Regarding the Philippine independence issue, there were different opinions on the American side. The Democratic Party, backed by Southern agricultural capital, supported the Philippine independence movement, while the Republican Party, backed by financial capital, advocated continuing to control the Philippines. However, the backgrounds of these two parties are not so clear, and financial oligarchs have always been dominant. Especially in the war, the military strategic position of the Philippines has become increasingly important. Therefore, the views of the two parties gradually converged, and they decided not to talk about Philippine independence anymore. As a result, a large number of Americans were sent to the Philippines, the ABCD line was vigorously advanced, and a large amount of credit loans, airplanes, and other weapons were supplied to the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War finally caused the United States to permanently lose the Philippines—the only military and economic base of the United States in Asia. What is the biggest blow to the United States? Of course, it lost the military resources of manganese, chromium, iron, and hemp in the Philippines, but this is not a fatal blow. The most important thing is that the United States lost its base for activities in Asia. The loss of the Philippines not only gives Japan a strategic location to advance to the Dutch East Indies and Malaya, but also loses its base for advancing into East Asia. It will be impossible to restore its hegemony in East Asia in the future! This is the point that makes the United States feel the most pain.</p>
<p>The Construction of the New Philippines</p>
<p>Not long after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Philippines fell under the control of the Japanese army. Recalling that it took Spain more than 30 years to conquer the Philippines more than 300 years ago, and the internal unrest after the United States occupied the Philippines also lasted for three years. However, Japan has now occupied the Philippines for only half a year, and the entire island has been pacified. In order to maintain law and order, the Philippine Military Administration has changed the municipal street police system to a national police system. Training institutes for police officers have been established at the central and local levels, and a baojia system, a self-police organization for the general public, has been created. All administrative work is focused on the principle of security first, striving to maintain law and order and leave no gaps.</p>
<p>In the political field, considering the relatively high cultural level of the Philippines, the policy of making as much use as possible of the original institutions is adopted. On January 3, when the Japanese army entered Manila, it announced this intention on January 4. On January 23, it ordered Mr. Vargas to organize a central executive government. Under the Chief Executive, there are six departments: Internal Affairs, Finance, Justice, Agriculture and Commerce, Education, Health and Welfare, and Civil Engineering and Transportation. Another powerful institution, the Philippine Military Administration, was established, with Chief Executive Vargas as one of its members. This constitutes the mechanism for political activities. Under the Philippine Central Executive Government, local administrative agencies are states, special cities, and villages. The power to appoint and dismiss administrative officials belongs to the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army. Therefore, in essence, the Philippine Central Executive Government is only an agency of the Military Administration.</p>
<p>In local administration, there were 49 states, 10 special cities, and more than 400 villages before the war. After the Japanese army occupied them, they were changed to 43 states and 8 special cities. Mayors and city heads have already been fully appointed, and 90% of the village chiefs have also been appointed. All institutions and personnel mostly inherited the traditions before the war, but there has been a huge difference in essence, that is, the liberalism, materialism, and other American colors in administration have been completely eliminated. Before the war, all state governors, mayors, village chiefs, and city council members were elected by the people, but now they are appointed by the Minister of Internal Affairs. The city council, which used to hold the great power of city politics, has now become an advisory body to the city head.</p>
<p>The police system used to be a city and village police system, but now it has been changed to a national police system. The Central Officials Training Institute has been established in Manila to provide new training to Philippine Executive Government officials and continuously carry out administrative reform. At the same time, under the new situation, all freedom of association in politics is not recognized, and the phenomenon of manipulating politics through party relations in the past is strictly prohibited. With the establishment of the new police system, five police officer training institutes have been established in Manila, and police officers have been mobilized for training. A central teacher training school has also been established to train teachers who can adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen military administration, official-civilian liaison offices have recently been established and a baojia system has been implemented. The former is an agency for conveying the intentions of superiors to subordinates and for subordinates to report situations to superiors. Its work is to carry out enlightenment propaganda, education, civil opinion surveys, and vocational guidance to the public, creating a bridge between the military and the people. The latter is not only of great significance in maintaining law and order but will also promote Japan's neighborhood group system. Under the guidance of economic and spiritual utilization, it will cooperate with the recently created Philippine Reconstruction Volunteer Corps to consolidate the administrative foundation.</p>
<h3>Goods Must Be Labeled, Sales Must Have Receipts - Orders Given for Police to Apprehend and Inspect Along the Way</h3>
<p>The authorities, regarding the retail stores in this city, since the Lunar New Year, have often refused to sell inventory and even closed early, obviously engaging in monopoly and hoarding in an attempt to make unexpected windfall profits. After strict crackdowns, all stores have resumed normal business and returned to a normal state. To further prevent retail stores from raising prices, they have ordered all stores to affix price labels to all goods for identification, and ordered all stores to issue invoices when selling goods, without refusing to do so on any pretext. They have also instructed police along the way to inspect the invoices of passersby carrying purchased goods. If any sales are found without invoices, the selling store will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Increase Interest Rates, Promote Savings, Absorb Idle Social Capital, Indirectly Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>Various banks and money houses, in order to comply with the authorities' aim to suppress prices and encourage production, are making every effort to promote the virtue of accumulating capital among the Chinese people in order to absorb idle social capital, use it well in productive enterprises, complete the mission of national industry, and eliminate speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering. Regarding savings business, each bank has established a special savings department to handle it. The accounting of this department is completely independent, not only completely separate from general business but also with separate accounts from other business, not mixed in any way. After each semi-annual settlement, it will be audited and announced by an accountant. At the same time, in accordance with government laws and regulations, deposit reserve funds will be paid to the Central Reserve Bank. The use of funds will be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Savings Bank Law, limited to investments in productive enterprises. Regarding interest rates, each bank and money house will decide on appropriate increases based on market financial conditions to encourage savings.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Receives Reporters, Sightseeing Group Departs Today</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai branch of the Qingxiang Committee launched the Qingxiang movement in Shanghai, six months have passed in a flash. The first phase of the Qingxiang work is nearing completion. Thanks to the cooperation of the military and civilians and the cooperation of all parties, the security of the Qingxiang area has been established and is on the path to development. In order to guide the actual situation in the Qingxiang area, the branch has specially invited news reporters from this city to organize a sightseeing group, which is scheduled to convene at the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office today (the 22nd) to officially establish itself. This sightseeing trip will last four days, with the aim of thoroughly understanding the progress of the Qingxiang work in this city and the results achieved, in order to convey them to the public.</p>
<h3>Responsible Parties Secretly Investigate Vegetable Prices, Canned Food Prices Must Also Be Lowered</h3>
<p>While the authorities and the two concessions are jointly cooperating to implement the sugar and oil ration system, the investigation department established by the authorities reported yesterday that it has secretly investigated the prices of fresh meat, vegetables, and other foods.</p>
<p>Vegetable Prices Rise Abnormally After the Spring Festival</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, the prices of fresh meat, vegetables, poultry, and other household foods sold in various vegetable markets and slaughterhouses have soared despite strong public opposition, exceeding the level of controlled prices. Most housewives have no way to buy food except at illegal prices. According to general opinion, the rise in food prices is due to seasonal factors, as similar situations often occur during the Lunar New Year holiday. However, no matter what, as of today, more than two weeks have passed since the New Year holiday, and the prices of fresh meat and vegetables are even higher than during the New Year, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Wholesale Prices Rise, Retail Prices Follow</p>
<p>According to observations by those paying attention to the vegetable market situation, yesterday, investigators dispatched by the Bureau of Public Works' Materials Control Office and similar organizations of the French Municipal Council are attempting to eliminate the reasons for the rise in prices. The results of the investigation attribute the vendors' exceeding the price limit to the high prices charged by wholesalers. Whether this is true remains to be investigated. However, it is understood that the results will eventually lower vegetable prices. It is generally hoped that the authorities will have more contact with the merchants in the vegetable market so that the supply, wholesale, intermediaries, and retailers are all controlled, and the livelihoods of millions of residents of Shanghai are maintained. It is generally believed that the Materials Control Office and the price control authorities of the French Municipal Council will not only limit the prices of fresh foods in the vegetable market but also lower the high prices of various canned foods.</p>
<h3>Overview of Works Department Activities - Part 8 of the Bureau of Public Works Annual Report</h3>
<p>During the past year, the Works Department of the Bureau of Public Works had great difficulty in obtaining the most needed materials and had to use alternative materials and change the methods of maintaining important services. Due to the lack of gasoline, the use of automobiles was greatly restricted, so automobiles were modified as much as possible to use gas for application.</p>
<p>The average amount of garbage transported by the Works Department was 1,460 tons per day. Garbage transportation relies entirely on manual labor and does not use motorized vehicles.</p>
<p>The selling price of wood rose twelvefold last year, and the selling price of steel increased ninefold, resulting in a sharp increase in the Works Department's expenditure on these materials. The waterproofing project on Yu Yuan Road has been completed, and single-channel floodgates have been installed in various districts. In addition, pumping stations are being built in the central and northern districts to deal with major floods. Half of the eight-foot-diameter flood control ditches in the western district have been laid.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Road wooden bridge across the Suzhou River is old and in danger of collapse and has been demolished. The roads that have been repaired include North Suzhou Road, Nanjing Road, Dahua Road, Avenue Petain, Avenue Joffre, Xinzha Road, Robison Road, Yu Yuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Route Tenant de St. Paul, Dixwell Road, Broadway Road, Kaifeng Road, East Seward Road, Baikal Road, Tangshan Road, Pingliang Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Dalian Bay Road, Huade Road, Huasheng Road, North Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, etc.</p>
<p>Last year, a total of 1,397,983 people visited the Jessfield Park, 107,749 fewer than the previous year. A total of 104,472 people visited the Chaochow Park, 53,123 fewer than the previous year. A total of 928,982 people visited the Bund Park, 316,422 more than the previous year.</p>
<p>The number of applications for construction permits for new buildings within the boundary was 1,020, compared to 2,579 the previous year. The number of construction permits approved and issued was 634. The estimated cost of new building construction was 25,486,500 yuan, compared to 65,490,620 yuan the previous year. In addition, 3,351 miscellaneous engineering permits were issued, with an estimated value of 1,650,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the new buildings for which construction permits were issued, there were 232 Chinese-style houses and shops, 16 Western-style houses, 5 apartment buildings, 2 office buildings, 1 bank building, 1 theater, 34 factories, 16 warehouses, 11 garages, and 467 other buildings.</p>
<p>The number of new houses estimated for tax collection after completion was 546. Works Department engineering inspectors inspected new buildings 51,812 times.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornaments Resume Listing, Increase in Price Limits Under Consideration, "Hefa" Market Automatically Suspends Gold Bar Transactions</h3>
<p>After the Bureau of Public Works' Materials Control Department decided to strictly enforce price limits on gold ornament transactions in the silver building industry and to punish violators according to law, all major and new colleagues in the city have complied with the order to resume business and restore listing transactions. The Silver Building Industry Association has requested the Materials Control Department to re-examine and increase the price limit for gold ornaments, arguing that the price of pure gold raw materials has risen sharply and the cost of gold ornaments has increased, so it is appropriate to increase the price with the market in order to maintain it. It is heard that the authorities are considering it, but before increasing the price limit, they will strictly enforce the price limit: (1) The price limit for gold bar transactions between gold industry members and colleagues is 27,500 yuan per bar; (2) The price limit for gold ornaments sold in silver building cabinets is 3,000 yuan per tael, which must not be exceeded. As for the "Hefa" market in the gold industry, it has automatically suspended gold bar transactions.</p>

<h3>Further Cracking Down on the Black Market, Police Secretly Investigate and Encourage Reporting, Negotiating with Relevant Parties on Enforcement of Disciplinary Measures</h3>
<p>Recently, the market conditions in Shanghai's various industries have been affected by the resurgence of speculative market brokers, resulting in soaring prices since the opening of the market after the New Year. In view of this, the concession authorities dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and subsequently imposed fines on the four major silver buildings, including Qiu Tianbao, and various yarn firms, severely cracking down on unauthorized price increases in various industries that exceeded the specified price limits. The rise in prices is mostly caused by black market exchanges, so to eradicate high prices in the future, it is necessary to strictly crack down on speculative transactions in the black market. In addition to continuing to send personnel to investigate the retail prices of various industries and prohibit price increases, more severe crackdowns will be carried out on market brokers who are currently secretly engaged in illegal black market transactions.</p>
<p>Detailed Plans Under Consideration</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the concession authorities have decided to implement detailed plans to curb the rising price trend and strictly enforce price limits. The content of these plans is currently being considered by the authorities and will be gradually implemented. It is found that the main reason for the upward trend in prices is that demand exceeds supply. Therefore, in order to eliminate this phenomenon, the authorities have decided to start with (1) the sources of imported goods in circulation and (2) preventing unscrupulous people from hoarding and profiteering, so that ordinary residents can purchase daily necessities at any time without being affected by shortages and causing panic.</p>
<p>Unblocking Sources, Encouraging Self-Manufacturing</p>
<p>Regarding the method of unblocking the sources of goods, the concession authorities have already started consultations with other relevant parties to ensure smooth transportation routes and reduce various obstacles. On the other hand, the authorities are also encouraging manufacturers in various industries to accelerate self-manufacturing in this port in order to make up for the shortage of goods transported from other places and to discuss severe measures to crack down on price increases.</p>
<p>Investigations and Reports Proceed Separately</p>
<p>At the same time, according to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the authorities are also making every effort to prevent hoarding. The work being carried out mainly includes the following: (1) Investigation work, in addition to being undertaken by special investigators dispatched by the Materials Control Office, the newly established economic police will also participate in the investigation after their training period expires. (2) Reporting work, the authorities will formally announce reward measures to order residents to report in a timely manner. The reporting methods are divided into two types: written and confidential and public reporting.</p>
<h3>Managers of Money Exchange Houses Jointly Hold a Reception, More Than Two Hundred Committee Members Attended</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, the business of the money exchange industry in this city has developed in a special way. New money houses have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Last spring, there were as many as 214 money houses registered with the association. Later, due to the international situation and the authorities' crackdowns on various related transactions, the various money houses in the industry were affected and struggled to maintain operations. As a result, many money houses closed or reorganized. As of the New Year this year, there were 119 listed and operating money houses, but their business was still extremely depressed. The industry is proceeding with the organization of a "Money Exchange United Bank" to develop and seek a safe passage through the current difficult situation. The colleagues in the industry also held a New Year reception at Wanli Restaurant at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 21st) to show solidarity.</p>
<p>Attending Money Houses</p>
<p>In addition to Pan Bingshen, Wen Zhenwei, Wu Shiqin, Liu Xichen, Li Lansheng, Zhang Shaotang, Cui Qiren, Chen Chao, Guo Muyi, Qiu Guangsen, Zhao Hongsheng, and others from the industry, the following were also present at yesterday's reception: Qian Tai, He Gong, Bao Da, Bao Kang, Hujiang, Zhen Rong, Qin Tai, Xie Tai, Hong Da, Xing Hua, Hong Chang, Qin Yu, Heng Tai, Bao Tai Xiang Mao, Yuan Chang, Da Yuan, Xiang Yuan, Bao Hua, Wan Tai, Hong Yu, Bao Yu, Ren Tai, Fu Chang, Jin Da, Wan Kang, Feng Tai, Hui Kang, Tai Hexing, Da Tong, Ren Kang, Sen Tai, Xiang Kang, Yi Xing, Ding Da, Zhong Ye Run De, Qing An, Tian Cheng, Hong Lai, Lian He, Zhen Xing, Shi Xing, and other more than 150 publicly recognized money house managers, as well as all committee members of the association and important staff members such as Wang Lizhi and Tang Renji, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After the managers of the various money houses took their seats, the chairman of the association, Pan Bingshen, stood up and gave a speech, stating that today is the New Year reception for colleagues in the money exchange industry, and he is very pleased that colleagues and committee members have come to participate enthusiastically. Especially as these hundreds of colleagues have encountered great difficulties, fortunately, the colleagues have close ties and unite sincerely, and have safely passed through the difficulties. He is deeply fortunate for the colleagues and deeply admires everyone's perseverance. Although the future of the industry this year is not bright, he still hopes that everyone will help each other, love each other, increase the strength of unity, and look forward to future development. He respectfully raises a glass to wish everyone good health, etc.</p>
<p>Money Exchange United Bank</p>
<p>The industry's business is difficult, and in order to strengthen the industry's unity and develop business, in addition to the usual operations of the money houses listed this year, the organization of the industry's "Money Exchange United Bank" has also been initiated, with a total capital of 2 million yuan. Colleagues' subscription to shares has been fully subscribed, and preparatory work is currently underway, including: (1) finding a location, (2) asking the authorities to verify the capital, and (3) waiting for the Ministry of Finance's business license. Once the ministry's license is issued, the opening date can be scheduled. As for the personnel issues of the bank, the following have been decided: Cui Pingxi will serve as chairman of the board, Pan Bingshen, Wu Shiqin, and four others will serve as managing directors, Li Lansheng will serve as general manager, Liu Xichen will serve as manager, and Zhang Shaotang will serve as deputy manager.</p>
<h3>Collection of Feast Tax, Noodles, Rice, and Dim Sum Are Not Taxed, Representatives' Petition Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>In order to enrich the educational funds of the urban area, the Municipal Finance Bureau has been ordered to levy a feast tax in the urban area and has established feast tax collection offices in Nanshi and other places. Since the beginning of the levy, which has been going on for two months, the tax is not limited to full-table feasts, and all retail hot dishes must be paid according to regulations. It is understood that the feast tax in the four districts of this city is contracted by Wen Wenhua, and tax collection offices are set up in the Huxi Xucao District, Pudong District, Zhabei District, and Nanshi District to collect 10% of the tax from restaurants and hotels. In the Nanshi District, 105 noodle and rice restaurants opposed the collection of taxes on noodles, rice, and dim sum stalls, and disputes arose. Therefore, the Nanshi Noodle and Rice Restaurant Association dispatched six representatives to petition the Municipal Finance Bureau a few days ago. It is now learned that the bureau has approved and stated that noodles, rice, and dim sum are not subject to taxation. In addition to ordering the contractor to comply, the representatives should inform the various merchants to comply and collect taxes from customers in accordance with the regulations, remit them to the collection office for transfer, allocate them for educational funds, and must not disobey on any pretext.</p>
<h3>China-Central Expands Ramie Production Areas, Implements a Planned Five-Year Plan, Sets Up a Model Area in Shanghai and Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The China-Japan Ramie Industry Company has now formulated its second-year work plan to expand the original ramie production in the plan. The company will expand the original ramie production area in Central China, select outstanding technical workers, establish model areas, and train agricultural students. According to the company, since last year, it has started a five-year plan. The results of the first year are far from ideal. The reason is the poor climate. In order to make up for the deficiencies of last year, it has been decided to set up a model production area in Hangzhou and Shanghai this year to guide Chinese farmers. The cost per area is about 15,000 yuan. In addition, starting this year, Chinese agricultural students will be trained so that China and Japan can have closer ties in agriculture. There are currently ten Chinese students being trained, with a total training cost of 20,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Public Works' Report on the Volunteer Corps for the Past Year</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Bureau of Public Works issued a report on the work of the Volunteer Corps for the past year. It was found that the training and association matters of the Bureau's Volunteer Corps were suspended after December 8 of the previous year, pending the Board of Directors' decision on its future. On January 5 of the past year, the Volunteer Corps began to take over the issuance of return-to-hometown permits for Chinese residents, which was transferred to the Industrial and Social Affairs Department on September 9. A total of 552,666 of these permits were issued by the various district permit-issuing offices. From February 1 to February 12, the Volunteer Corps members held guard posts in the Central, Xinzha, Pudu, and Weisi police districts during the census in this city. On February 27, Volunteer Corps Commander Lieutenant Colonel Meng En was notified by the Bureau to immediately stop all training matters. The commander was then transferred to the Works Department to serve. On September 3, the Bureau's Board of Directors held a meeting and decided to abolish the Volunteer Corps. The decision was officially announced and all members were notified to return their uniforms and equipment. At the time of deciding to abolish the Volunteer Corps, the Board of Directors expressed admiration for the past contributions of all members to social service. On October 7, the Volunteer Corps flag was changed to be hung in the Bureau's conference room as a commemoration. At that time, the former senior officers and commanders of each team of the corps were invited by the Director-General of the Bureau to attend the flag-hanging ceremony.</p>
<p>Overview of the Legal Department's Work</p>
<p>Last year, the Bureau's Legal Department filed a total of 114,721 civil suits with the First Special Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, a decrease of 10,000 cases compared to the previous year.

<h3>Customs Ships Liuxing and Haiguang on Missions</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Administration, in order to supply food, fuel, and fresh water to the keepers of the navigational lighthouses at sea, still used the grain transport ship Liuxing for delivery. The patrol ship Haiguang inspected the buoys and lightships in the Yangtze River estuary to facilitate navigation.</p>
<h3>In Order to Thoroughly Solve the People's Food Problem, Grain Rations Should Be Sufficient, Types of Mixed Grains to Be Announced</h3>
<p>Regarding the problem of ten essential food items for the residents of this port, the authorities are planning a thorough solution. Since the recent periods, the household rice and flour have increased. In order to prevent residents from experiencing a food shortage, the authorities have announced that starting today (the 21st), when receiving ration cards, residents will be allowed to receive an additional mixed grain card. Whether this mixed grain will be corn flour, bean flour, or other bean products is still being handled and has not yet been accurately determined. However, according to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the authorities will gradually ensure that each resident receives enough rations for every ten days. As for oil, sugar, and other secondary foods, a fair distribution system will be implemented within a possible range in order to prevent manipulation by illegal profiteers and the suffering of those unable to afford high prices.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Century-Long Plan for Society, Raising Orphaned and Destitute Children, Fulfilling Humanity's Responsibilities Amidst Hardship and Suffering: A Visit to the Holy Mother's Orphanage in Xujiahui</h3>
<p>That the young should be cared for, the strong should be educated, and the old should be provided for until the end of their lives – these are pressing matters for society. Especially in these times of multiple adversities, with widespread mourning, discussing education and care is exceptionally difficult. However, it is precisely because it is so difficult that we need the collective strength of the community to support it. Our newspaper's establishment of scholarship funds is but a tiny fraction of what is needed in the realm of "education." When it comes to "care," we deeply regret that we have temporarily no way to contribute. By chance, and with a sincere desire for a visit, we arrived at the Holy Mother's Orphanage in Xujiahui. We felt deeply for these orphaned and destitute children, thought about the future needs of society, and felt it was necessary to chronicle our visit in order to implore the collective strength of society to safeguard this arduous undertaking.</p>
<p>Once Nurtured Seventy to Eighty Thousand Children</p>
<p>In the environment of gardens and vegetable plots on Pudong Road in Xujiahui stands a wide, tall building. Within this building, seventy to eighty thousand children have been nurtured, educated, and taught skills. Of course, many have already established careers in society, but there are still five hundred and fifty currently being cared for. Among them, more than one hundred and eighty are infants from swaddling age to two or three years old; about two hundred are from four or five to fifteen years old; and nearly one hundred are over fifteen years old.</p>
<p>Founded for Nearly a Century, Reputation Spreads Across the Country</p>
<p>As we walked into this building, we felt two sentiments: one was a sense of sorrow for the plight of these orphaned children, and the other was a feeling that they had already obtained light amidst their tragic circumstances. We talked with the nuns and learned that the institution has been established for nearly a century, dedicated to serving the welfare of the people, such as establishing schools, providing poverty relief, caring for the elderly, and nurturing children. The Chongde and Qiming Girls' Schools, founded by the institution, have a long history and an outstanding reputation. The original old folks' home and disabled home were transformed into an old folks' home, the Xin Puyu Hall, thirty years ago. Today, in addition to the affiliated Chongde and Qiming Girls' Schools and nurseries, and Chinese and Western clinics, the Holy Mother's Institute takes care for the orphanage and the school for the deaf and mute; it has also specially established an embroidery workshop, a lace workshop, a tailoring workshop, and a laundry room.</p>
<p>Miracles at the School for the Deaf and Mute</p>
<p>What we found miraculous was when we visited the school for the deaf and mute; we found their achievements to be truly astonishing. They first used letters, aided by gestures, to teach them to make sounds, and then gradually taught them to recognize, write, read, and compose. After three or four years, the deaf-mute children could speak with others, and listeners could understand them. After five or six years, their pronunciation was almost the same as that of ordinary people. This work of compensating for the natural deficiencies of human beings is truly a savior for deaf-mute children.</p>
<p>Embroidery and Lace Available for Outside Orders</p>
<p>We arrived at the embroidery room and saw forty or so female workers embroidering flowers, landscapes, birds, animals, and portraits. They take orders from the outside world. In 1924, they won an award at the Rome Exhibition. In the lace room, there were also forty or so people working. All kinds of bed sheets, tablecloths, pillowcases, handkerchiefs, sewing thread, and knitting supplies were available. Many people from all walks of life come to place orders. We went through several bedrooms, all large rooms. We saw every baby lying peacefully in a small iron bed, the clothes and bedding clean and the care meticulous. Children of four or five years old were in kindergarten class, learning to read. Older children were attending primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Difficulties with Sustenance: We Have a Responsibility</p>
<p>Rising prices have reduced the nutrition of the children in the hall. According to the nuns, the hall's expenses were mostly donated by French philanthropists in the past. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of the European war, donations completely stopped. There was no source of income for daily expenses, and the cost of living was increasing. The hall fell into unprecedented difficulties. Children need nutrition most. In the past, milk was the main food for infants, but now they can only fill their stomachs with porridge and milk powder. Two- and three-year-olds are fed porridge by older orphaned girls. The porridge only contains a small amount of vegetable soup. Four- and five-year-old children eat a small bowl of rice or a small bowl of porridge three times a day, and only a very small snack in the afternoon. Children aged seven or eight and above eat two bowls of porridge each morning and evening, and one bowl of noodles and one bowl of rice at noon. Each person gets one vegetable dish and one soup. On Fridays, they eat a small piece of salted fish, and on Sundays, they eat a small piece of pork, which is only the size of a broad bean. The so-called porridge and rice are actually cooked with xian rice, broken rice, pearl rice, sweet potatoes, and other ingredients.</p>
<p>We are concerned about the difficulties in providing sustenance for the entire hall. According to what we saw, these five hundred or so children need sixty dan of rice per month. Including all expenses, more than fifty thousand yuan is needed per month, and the cost of house repairs is not included. We think that these are all innocent children. Although they have been abandoned by their parents, how can we allow them to be abandoned by the community? If we sit idly by and watch them die, we would be going against the virtue of cherishing life. If we let them wander, we will see an increase in displaced people. Society should jointly find ways to help them grow into adults, so that the country will have one more good citizen, and society will have one more person who can contribute.</p>
<p>Of course, we should express our feelings with the utmost sympathy to society, and hope that all sectors of society can visit in person and provide financial assistance. The places for receiving donations are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Holy Mother's Orphanage, Pudong Road, Xujiahui, telephone number 70235.</p>
<p>(2) Banque Franco-Chinoise, No. 9 The Bund, French Concession. (3) Qian Tai Bank, No. 461 Ningbo Road, telephone number 12649. (4) He Tai Bank, No. 136 Nanjing Road, telephone number 10554. Donors can also notify the orphanage by phone to send someone to collect the donations.</p>
<p>A Paradise for Orphaned and Destitute Children: The Holy Mother's Orphanage in Xujiahui has been established for nearly a century and has raised seventy to eighty thousand children. Left picture (top): well-ordered and clean orphans; (bottom): orphans eating; looking forward to donations from all walks of life to provide them with sufficient sustenance.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Improving Shangchuan Road</h3>
<p>— A Traveler</p>
<p>This New Year's Day, I retired to my hometown. Before the war, it only took two hours to get from Shanghai to Chuansha, but now it takes seven or eight hours, and it is crowded and chaotic beyond description. Even though it is only a short journey, one experiences the fatigue of a long journey by boat and car. Here, I will briefly describe the inconveniences I felt, and I hope that the responsible authorities will pay attention and improve them.</p>
<p>There are too many ships docking at Pier 13 in Shanghai, so it seems appropriate to open up another exit. Passengers with luggage and cargo should enter and exit separately from those traveling alone, and the inspection procedures should be quick and clear, so that those behind can reduce their waiting time and avoid the risk of missing their boat.</p>
<p>Shelters should be built and seats provided on the pier so that passengers waiting for the boat are not exposed to the sun and rain, and the elderly, weak, women, and children can get some rest.</p>
<p>Before, when Shangchuan Road was privately operated, tickets for the bus and the municipal ferry were sold together as a combined ticket. Passengers only needed to buy one ticket to reach their destination. Now that it is run by the city, the practice of combined tickets should be continued, and it should not be necessary to buy separate tickets, in order to save manpower and time. Like this trip home, I waited for three hours at the Qingning Temple station to buy a ticket. When the ticket office started selling tickets, people inside the station squeezed out, and people outside the station squeezed in. Passengers on both sides crowded at the ticket window, so that those who bought tickets were squeezed in the middle, unable to move forward or backward. The elderly, weak, women, and children were in danger of being crushed.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only three buses a day. Since there are so few buses, the schedule must be accurate. Before, the times of the ferry and the train were connected, and passengers did not have to wait long to change from the train to the boat after arriving at Qingning Temple. Now, although the schedule indicates that the middle bus arrives at 12:15 and departs at 12:40, on that day it did not arrive until 2:20 in the afternoon and departed at 3:10. Passengers generally waited from 11:00 in the morning, waiting until they were hungry and their backs were sore. According to the food stalls near the station, delays are common. Now, one can only say that there are three buses a day, but there is no guarantee of the exact times. The authorities should pay attention, because this not only wastes passengers' time and money (buying food when hungry), but also causes passengers to miss appointments.</p>
<p>Ferry fares should be sold at the price printed on the ticket, and should not be overcharged. The Shanghai to Qingning Temple ticket is printed with a price of one yuan and four jiao, but one must pay one yuan and five jiao. The authorities should instruct employees not to overcharge.</p>
<p>Also, there used to be wooden bridges along the Shangchuan Road railway bridges for people to walk on, but now the wooden bridges have been stolen, making it very dangerous for pedestrians. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the Public Works Bureau will repair them as soon as possible to benefit pedestrians.</p>

<p>The City Police Department recently noted that the armbands and collar patches worn by the various police stations under its jurisdiction have only been replaced every few years, resulting in most of them being worn out and unusable, which is detrimental to appearances. Therefore, a large batch of new patches has been specially made and ordered to be collected and replaced by the various sub-bureaus to improve appearances.</p>
<h3>Public Use of Police Whistles is Unsustainable and Unhygienic: Self-Purchase is Recommended: Baojia Chiefs Have Issued Warnings</h3>
<p>In various Baojia districts of the two concessions, police whistles used by police officers have often been purchased by the public, resulting in a situation where they are used interchangeably. The health authorities are currently engaged in promoting public hygiene, and this habit of public use of police whistles is not hygienic. Therefore, the various Baojia chiefs have advised their police officers to purchase their own whistles for their own use to avoid transmitting diseases to others.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Will Limit the Price of Waterproof Lacquered Cloth</h3>
<p>The waterproof lacquered cloth industry in this city has no guild organization, so there is no price limit for raincoats sold in the market. In order to adapt to the environment and comply with the wishes of the authorities, Liang Daxiong of the Puliang Company and others are responsible for organizing a guild, which has been approved by the authorities this month on the 17th. Currently, there are only seven member units. They are actively handling the cost statistics of waterproof lacquered cloth, investigating and creating tables, and submitting them to the Materials Control Department for review. In short, the authorities will soon set a price limit for raincoats sold in the market.</p>
<h3>Price Change for Gasoline Substitutes in the French Concession Starting Today: 110 Yuan (Central Reserve Currency) per Gallon</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council announces that the price of gasoline substitutes for automobiles will be changed. The price of the bureau's gasoline substitutes for automobiles sold at the gas station at No. 1244 Avenue Joffre will be 110 yuan (Central Reserve Currency) per gallon, effective February 22, 1943 (Monday). All are informed.</p>
<h3>Sun Zuji, Director of the Bureau of Insurance Supervision, Discusses the Current Situation of the Insurance Business in Beijing</h3>
<p>Sun Zuji, Director of the Bureau of Insurance Supervision of the Ministry of Industry, in order to understand the situation of the insurance business in various places and to improve the supervision of the national insurance business, accompanied Zhu Jia Cheng, the head of the second section of the bureau, to inspect the actual situation of the insurance business in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places along the line on the 15th of this month and to supervise improvements. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after completing their official duties. The reporter visited Director Sun yesterday and received the following speech: Due to official duties and time constraints, I was unable to inspect other places and only visited Nanjing. The general situation of the insurance business in Beijing is that there were very few branch offices of insurance companies in the past, only some insurance firms. Currently, the following companies in Shanghai have officially established branch offices in Beijing: Taiping, Tianyi, Danan, Dadong, Anda, China, Baolong, Shanghai, Lianbao, and eighteen others. There are also agencies or offices. Among them, Taiping and Baolong Insurance Companies have built their own buildings, which are quite large. The scope of their business includes fire and other loss insurance, as well as life insurance. Anda's business is the largest and is thriving. During my visit to Beijing, I aimed to put the insurance industry on the right track. Therefore, at the welcome meeting of the Beijing Insurance Industry Association on the 16th, I spoke to the members of the association about the following: (1) Establish a branch office system to protect legitimate branch offices. The so-called establishment of a branch office system is to change the nature of branches that are just agencies or offices, because these branches do not have a fixed person in charge, which can lead to abuses. (2) Unify insurance rates. The insurance companies in Beijing each act independently, and their premiums are not unified, which is not appropriate. Therefore, I ordered them to agree on an insurance rate (usually 8 yuan per 1,000 yuan) and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for approval before implementation in order to unify the rates. (3) Reorganize the association. In the past, only a few insurance companies were established in Beijing, and most of the directors were insurance brokers, which was not very legitimate and should be reorganized. (4) Raise the status of insurance brokers and allow them to register as soon as possible in order to carry out their business. Furthermore, Director Sun will travel to Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places at the end of this month for inspection.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council This Year's Recurring Budget</h3>
<p>The amount of subsidies to be allocated to private schools this year is 50% more than last year. This is a trial listing, and the actual amount to be allocated in the future has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>(14) General Expenses: This year's budget for this item is 18,001,30 yuan, including retirement pay, pensions, rent for rented houses, subsidies to charitable organizations, and expenses not belonging to various departments. 2,000,000 yuan is needed for air defense and alert measures, and 700,000 yuan is needed for teaching Japanese. The retirement pay item is 8,193,890 yuan more than last year. It is expected that more employees will retire this year, so a large sum must be reserved for emergencies. The bureau plans to allocate 1,500,000 yuan to the program to relieve beggars. The remaining amount under the subsidy item is hoped to be offset by fines for controlling goods, and to be allocated for the expense of relieving refugees, nominally listed at 200,000 yuan. The subsidies allocated to various charitable organizations are nominally listed at 192,410 yuan, about 70% more than last year.</p>
<p>(15) Interest, Commissions, etc.: This year's expenditure on this item is estimated at 2,294,530 yuan, a decrease of 1,710,820 yuan compared to last year. The reason for the reduction is that the bureau's liabilities calculated in old legal tender have been converted to new legal tender at a ratio of three to one.</p>
<p>(16) Public Debt Repayment: This year's expenditure on this item is estimated at 1,522,680 yuan, a reduction of 1,623,710 yuan compared to last year. The reason for the reduction is also that the bureau's debts calculated in old legal tender have been converted to new legal tender at a ratio of two to one.</p>
<p>Guild Section: In order to maintain close contact with the various industry guilds and to achieve the purpose of price control, the bureau decided to establish a Guild Section in October of last year. Until the end of the year, the work of this section focused on reviewing the registration applications of retail merchants, distributors, and manufacturers of various industries. 181 registration applications were considered, of which 54 were submitted by the section for approval, and 127 are still under consideration. Number of Employees in the Materials Control Office: The various departments currently have 461 Chinese employees and 91 foreign employees, distributed as follows:</p>

<h3>Western Union First Division Second Round: Donghua Tied Yihai Navy Yesterday: Neither Side Gained...Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>The Western Union First Division second-round match between Donghua and Yihai Navy was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3:45 PM. Spectators flocked to the event, making it an unprecedented spectacle, with a total of no less than 10,000 people. Referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle to start the game. Yihai Navy kicked off the ball first and attacked repeatedly, but was repelled by Han Longhai one by one. Donghua launched a counterattack, and at nine minutes, A Kui passed the ball skillfully to A Dai, who delivered a挑送 (tiao song, a term referring to a specific passing technique) to Jia Youliang. Jia shot the ball with a hook, but unfortunately it went wide of the goal. Less than a minute later, Cao Qinfang kicked a corner, and Xu Wenkui followed up with a kick, hitting the crossbar. At fifteen minutes, Xu passed the ball along the sideline, but unfortunately it hit the upright, failing to score. Two minutes later, Wang Xisheng shot, and McNitty laid down to catch it. Liang Shutang dashed in, and Rossi collided with Lati. Donghua lost another good opportunity. Yihai's Villa penetrated the right wing, but fortunately Li Ning cleared it into a corner kick without any mishaps. Donghua's Jia Youliang attacked twice, dribbling past three defenders and passing the ball into the middle, with good landing points, but unfortunately Cao Qinfang and A Dai failed to break through the goal. Afterwards, Villa shot powerfully from beyond the 20-yard mark, but was caught by Zhang Banglun. Before long, the first half ended, with both sides failing to score. After a break, Donghua's attack became even stronger. At five minutes, McNitty committed a handball, and A Dai kicked the ball low and abruptly, but unfortunately it went a foot wide. Four minutes later, A Kui had a great opportunity to score from more than ten yards from the goal, but unfortunately he shot into McNitty's leg, causing the audience to stomp their feet and sigh in regret. Yihai's luck turned around, and Di Pan, Bao Jie, and Taylor had shooting opportunities, but fortunately Zhang Banglun was agile and averted danger one by one. At 38 minutes, Cao Qinfang拉射 (la she, a term referring to a specific shooting technique), and McNitty jumped up to catch it. Jia Youliang rushed in, and McNitty rolled into the net with the ball and the man, but because Jia collided with the person, it was ruled invalid. Soon after, the regulation time was up, and Donghua drew 0-0 with Yihai Navy. Donghua's performance yesterday was superb, with Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Zhang Banglun being particularly outstanding. Apart from McNitty, Yihai Navy's performance was very ordinary. Donghua failed to win under absolute advantage, which must be fate. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Club</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Li Ning Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Han Longhai Wang Xisheng Zhang Zhaopeng</p>

<h3>Overall View of the Japanese Budget: Showa 18th Year</h3>
<p>Japan's finances for Showa 18 (1943) will be for a decisive battle period. Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the 79th Diet convened and passed the general account expenditure budget for Showa 17 at over 8.838 billion yen, and the temporary military expenditure budget at 18 billion yen. For Showa 18, the second year of the decisive battle, the general account revenue and expenditure budget (including the first and second supplementary budgets) was over 132.75 billion yen, and was passed unconditionally and without amendment by the House of Representatives on the 13th of this month. The ninth temporary military expenditure budget, which was established in both houses on the 10th of this month, reached the enormous sum of over 36.035 billion yen. Compared to the 2.3 billion yen of expenditure in Showa 11, before the China Incident, this is a more than tenfold increase, unprecedented in the Japanese budget. One of the goals of national economic operation today is to rapidly expand material war power in order to enhance wartime productivity. Therefore, all fiscal and economic policies, as well as the compilation of next year's budget, stem from this point. The essence of wartime finance cannot but be a strict focus on essential needs and efficiency.</p>
<p>Contents of the Showa 18 Budget</p>
<p>Looking at the expenditure budget, the expenses under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy ministries have been incorporated into the temporary military expenditure since the previous fiscal year. Therefore, the total expenditure budget under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy ministries is only over 1.83 million yen, a decrease of over 77.7 million yen from the previous year, and a decrease of over 3.248 billion yen from the year before last.</p>
<p>Savings and reductions in established expenses amount to over 368.8 million yen, only an increase of over 14.4 million yen compared to the previous year's over 354.4 million yen. As mentioned above, efforts were made to rationalize the expenditure budget, but it still increased by over 3.957 billion yen compared to the previous year due to the following reasons: Namely, items such as national debt, pensions, and military support expenses have increased annually, the amount diverted to temporary military expenditure has increased by over 1.615 billion yen, and in addition, the national treasury reserve funds, originally 50 million yen for the first reserve fund and 800 million yen for the second reserve fund in this budget, have been increased by 30 million yen for the former and 700 million yen for the latter in the supplementary budget, resulting in an increase of 730 million yen compared to the previous year. If we subtract the above-mentioned expenses of an obligatory nature, amounting to over 3.695 billion yen, from the total expenditure of over 132.75 billion yen, and further subtract the difference in newly added important expenses required by the current situation, the pure administrative expenses will decrease by approximately 80 million yen compared to the budget for this year.</p>
<p>The temporary military expenditure directly supplies the war expenses for the Greater East Asia War. The total amount of temporary military expenditure budgets from the first to the ninth reaches the enormous sum of over 74.128 billion yen. The Greater East Asia War is unfolding fierce battles in a vast area stretching from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the South Pacific Ocean in the south. At the same time, it is necessary to provide the expenses required for the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the occupied territories in the south. Therefore, the expansion of temporary military expenditure is an inevitable reality.</p>
<p>To supply this expenditure, public bonds and taxes are the main sources. The large tax increase centered on indirect taxes, which was implemented for the first time at the beginning of this year, is expected to increase revenue by over 1.7 billion yen compared to the budget of over 1.145 billion yen in the previous year. In addition, tobacco taxes have also been increased since the 17th of last month, and it is estimated that revenue will increase by over 442.2 million yen compared to previous years. The increased indirect tax revenue is all allocated to the financial resources for temporary military expenditure.</p>
<p>The regular portion of tax revenue is over 6.06 billion yen, and the temporary portion is over 1.529 billion yen, totaling over 7.589 billion yen. This is an increase of over 1.829 billion yen compared to the previous year. Due to the expansion of temporary military expenditure, the amount of national bonds issued will inevitably increase significantly. In the general account and various special accounts for Showa 18, the total of the supplementary budget for temporary military expenditure reaches over 210.2 billion yen. In order to digest such a huge amount of expenditure, the government must make considerable efforts in issuing national bonds.</p>
<p>The Core of the Greater East Asia Finances</p>
<p>The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is based on Japanese finances as the core of the Greater East Asia finances. The Southern Development Bank has obtained the right to issue banknotes and has borrowed 3.3 billion yen from the bank as part of the financial resources for the current temporary military expenditure. Japanese finances are providing various forms of cooperation depending on the progress of development in the occupied territories in the south. The special account for special property funds established this time is a measure to handle enemy property, enhance production, and to meet military needs, and is a supplementary measure for Japan's wartime finances. In addition, the special account for adjusting foreign exchange transactions established by establishing trading companies aims to move away from the gold pound and gold yuan, and to make the Japanese yen the guiding currency within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Today, Manchuria and China are naturally cooperating economically with Japan, and material transactions with Thailand and Vietnam are expected to develop more soundly in the future. Japan has acquired abundant resources in the Greater East Asia War and has already become a wealthy country. Currently, national finance occupies an absolute position in the entire economy. At the same time, if the economy cannot circulate smoothly, financial obstacles will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>The estimated national income for next year is 50 billion yen, and the allocation is planned as follows: 10 billion yen for taxes and other similar forms of taxation, 21 billion yen for public bonds, 6 billion yen for production expansion funds, and 12 billion yen for national consumption funds. Among these, the total of 27 billion yen for public bonds and production expansion funds is an item that is hoped will be paid by the citizens in a non-tax form in the coming year. In order to complete the war, the goal is for people to save, and this is the national savings target amount. Citizens will cooperate with the authorities due to their obligation to pay taxes and their voluntary participation, in order to complete this national savings.

<h3>Key Points of Japan's Propaganda War: Discord Among Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Mr. Shinzo Imai of the House of Representatives questioned the government on the current state of the propaganda war at the Budget Committee at 1:00 PM on the 15th. The gist of the answer by Vice Director Okumura of the Information Bureau is as follows:</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Suspicion Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The propaganda war and the military war are both of great importance. The propaganda war often focuses on the enemy's weaknesses. Therefore, the government pays close attention to reporting on domestic affairs in Britain and the United States, using this as material for propaganda. The principle of propaganda often starts from a deep examination of the perspective of their national character. The propaganda objectives of Japan, Germany, and Italy in this war are very clear, with the construction of a new world order as a consistent principle. On the other hand, the war aims of Britain and the United States lack consistency, so Britain and the United States each go their own way, each conducting propaganda for their own purposes.</p>
<p>For example, on November 10th of last year, Churchill explicitly declared to the nation that the purpose of the war was: "Britain must continue to maintain its centuries-old dominance of the world, and we are fighting for this." The United States completely denied this. Last autumn, Roosevelt instructed Willkie to declare: "The sacrifices of the American people are not for the sake of maintaining the prosperity of Britain, but rather for breaking the old order of Britain and creating a new United Nations in the world." As a result, a great reef arose between the two.</p>
<p>In short, the United States no longer has Britain in its sights, and its ambition to seize world hegemony is clearly revealed. The relationship between Britain and the United States has not been closely linked, and they are already inconsistent in their war aims. Britain is deeply dissatisfied with the United States drawing South American countries into its embrace. Moreover, the dispatch of American troops to Australia, India, and South America is even more intolerable to the British people. As a result, various frictions have arisen. In particular, the fact that British law does not apply to American soldiers has greatly irritated the national sentiment of Britain, leading to various conflicts.</p>
<p>Recently, Knox declared to a group of journalists: "From the Pacific Islands to the whole world, we will add airfields that the United States deems necessary everywhere." The British side was greatly irritated by this. The meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt in Casablanca did not lead to a more satisfactory connection between the two countries. The leaders of the two countries thought that unless they met and discussed in this place, it would not be enough to bring about a compromise between the de Gaulle faction and the Giraud faction, but in reality, it did not achieve anything. Not only in the propaganda war, but also in these places, we can see the greatest difficulties among the Anglo-American group.</p>
<p>The government has seized on this weakness and implemented a very appropriate propaganda war, which has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Also Distrusts Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Speaking of the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they are not maintaining a harmonious and seamless friendship. Britain and the United States are not happy with the Soviet Union's victory, but only use the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also understands the relationship, so it does not place too much trust in Britain and the United States. In fact, Britain and the United States have never provided the Soviet Union with sufficient weapons and ammunition. With the North African front as the priority, the Soviet Union does not attach importance to propaganda on the war front. The reasons why Stalin did not attend the Casablanca meeting are not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The Castle in the Air of Aiding Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>The relationship between Britain, the United States, and Chongqing: Before the start of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing was once the darling of the world, but in today's position, it has completely reversed. Britain and the United States have become the center of the war, and the image given by Chongqing is extremely weak. Therefore, military assistance to Chongqing is also insufficient. Chongqing's ambassador to the United States is regarded as a thorn in the eye in Washington, which can prove the inside story. In particular, since the fall of Burma, the supply of aid materials to Chiang Kai-shek has been completely cut off. Soong Mei-ling went to the United States to appeal in tears, but did not achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Soon after Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States, she was involved in a car accident and injured her foot, but it was publicized as being bombed by Japan in order to win the sympathy of the public. This clearly shows the meaninglessness of the propaganda methods.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it can be seen that the war aims of the enemy camp are fundamentally inconsistent and are constantly initiating friction. The Japanese side is closely watching this situation and is studying appropriate methods to utilize it. (Source: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 16th)</p>
<h3>Reforming German National Life</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent in Berlin, Dispatch of the 6th) In the mysterious and solemn nights of Berlin, taxis have stopped free operation, and flourishing places are devoid of people. In the silent cold night, only the mutually silent recognition, the glory of the corpses piled on the ruins of Stalingrad, makes the German soul coagulate as one from top to bottom. Walking leisurely in the streets, one often hears people saying, "Very good, it's still far from the bitterness of the end of the last war!" An old clerk in a radio shop closes the shop door with a creak. Due to the non-wartime business suspension order issued on the 4th, radio shops are limited to closing by March 15th. The calm people are now enduring a surprising transformation of national life. Because of the lessons of the disastrous defeat in 1918, and because of the awakening caused by the plight of the Sixth Army, the people cannot help but endure this transformation. President Hitler, in view of the fact that the people were intoxicated with the war results at the beginning of the war and believed that the difficulties had passed after the winter battles of last year, tried to make everyone understand the actual situation of the war as much as possible, which is a wise move in the struggle for ultimate victory. Therefore, "Then it's our turn," free volunteer women are stepping into military factories to work.</p>
<p>For example, the maid at our Berlin branch voluntarily reported to the labor camp to provide her personal labor. This type of maid did not conflict with the mobilization order for women aged 17 to 45. If she served in the branch, she could be ignored, but they all volunteered to serve. The rise of such women can be regarded as proof of Germany's tension. Therefore, the changes in women's lives are more drastic than those of men.</p>
<p>The closure of diamond shops and gold and silver smiths has not had much impact on the psychology of ordinary women, but the absence of women's fashion stores, beauty salons, and perfume shops, and the inability to wash hair in barbershops is a revolution for European women.</p>
<p>"Do you feel pessimistic?"</p>
<p>It would be foolish to ask this question at this time. Even if fashion and makeup are taken away, the women now are no longer the same. The tragedy of Stalingrad has caused German women to wash away the color of their makeup with hot tears. The women of the will to the nation are thoroughly carrying out the New Life Movement, which British and American women are using as a tool for malicious propaganda, challenging international vanity. They are far from being worthy opponents. Their tears are not for the lack of makeup, but for winning the victory of the war.</p>
<p>A certain well-known young woman sent a letter, which read:</p>
<p>"Because of my husband's promotion on the front lines, I am now the wife of a sergeant major. The children are getting more lively and lovely every day. As the wife of a soldier, I must raise these children and live strongly."</p>
<p>This is the same as the psychology of Japanese women. With this strong spirit expressed, Germany will absolutely not be defeated. The Japanese people's thinking is originally close to death, while the German people's thinking is essentially different. However, the concept of Marshal Paulus and others being loyal to their duty and generously going to their deaths is no longer the atmosphere of the Germans and is truly dramatic and touching.</p>
<p>The Japanese self-explosion moved the people of the country. Now that the heroes of our own country are also taking this action, the hearts of the people in the rear are even more shaken to tears, and unconsciously, they hold the same hatred with the soldiers on the front lines. The revolution in rear life stems from this.</p>
<p>"The three-day rest of the entertainment venues is a form of prayer for the people. In the last war, such things were unimaginable," muttered an old woman. In the future, all nightlife entertainment venues, bars, and restaurants will be closed, but in terms of food, one can still eat 350 grams of meat per week. Recalling when we only ate wild vegetables three times a day in 1917-18 and still fought stubbornly, even if we reach that point in the future, the people's minds are already filled with the confidence of great men. Moreover, at that time, it was the result of a lack of materials, but now there is no worry about a lack of materials. Also, as "God's chosen people," the German people can be flexible and have another kind of vitality. In the President's declaration on the 10th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, he stated: "The countries that survive in a crippled state after the war and the countries that perish no longer exist." This kind of self-awareness has deeply permeated the hearts of the people. Regardless of old or young, men or women, they repeatedly reaffirm their determination to win. The defeats on the Western Front in 1918 and the Eastern Front in 1942-23 have made the German soul especially united. Due to the changes in life, a solid and indestructible iron wall has been forged in the rear. (Source: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, February 8th)</p>

<h3>A Record of the German Fleet's Expedition to the Arctic Ocean</h3>
<p>Sinking of a British Transport Ship</p>
<p>The boundless and vast Arctic Ocean unfolded before our eyes. A seaplane returning from reconnaissance roared overhead, conveying important news. Immediately afterward, the sounding of an alarm broke the silence of the fleet's voyage. Soldiers quickly took their combat positions, unknowingly, when suddenly a large transport ship came into view. Needless to say, it was a British transport ship, and as expected, it was an armed vessel. Our own reconnaissance aircraft reported that it was a ship of 18,000 to 20,000 tons.</p>
<p>However, it was not until an hour later that it was confirmed that the ship was actually the giant 21,000-ton transport ship "Oram".</p>
<p>It's quite comical to say that this transport ship, until the first shell landed beside it, consistently thought we were escorts, not realizing we were enemy warships.</p>
<p>The guns of our warships roared again. The only way to let the British know how formidable we are is this method. After the enemy ship was hit by a shell, the crew seemed to have completely lost their will to resist, immediately wanting to abandon the ship and start jumping into lifeboats, making their escape. Thereupon, we ceased firing, and our cruisers, arranged in a line, approached the enemy ship, taking all the fleeing enemy crew members aboard our warships. When all the crew members had been rescued, the enemy ship began its final farewell to the world. In an instant, the colossal object sank into the depths of the icy sea.</p>
<p>Our fleet did not reduce its horsepower, advancing grandly onward. Our warships are not only fast but also have a high degree of navigational capability, which is why we were able to come to such a distant corner of the sea to fight. We are now operating in an area of the ocean that is fully one thousand nautical miles away from our homeland. One thousand nautical miles is equivalent to the distance from Hamburg to the coast of Africa.</p>
<p>Discovery of an Enemy Aircraft Carrier</p>
<p>Now we have two warships that have already left the formation. These two detached warships – a cruiser and a destroyer – became a separate detachment, going off to carry out their special operational missions. The remaining warships searched for enemy traces alone in the icy sea.</p>
<p>Dusk slowly approached, and on the distant horizon, wisps of black smoke were spotted. Because it is bright all night there, it is still not dark after dusk. This is truly a convenient door opened for us by heaven. We judged from the number of smoke trails that it seemed like three ships. We were all hoping that they were British ships, so we could once again show our skills.</p>
<p>Soon, in our fine telescopes, we clearly saw the three ships. Two British destroyers were escorting an aircraft carrier. This aircraft carrier, without any concealment, displayed its full width. Decks: Indeed, if our destroyers were compared to this behemoth, it would be like a small witch meeting a great one. At this instant, communication between our fleet commander and the commanders of each unit became tense and close. Just as a earth-shattering event was about to erupt, everything was as quiet as iron.</p>
<p>The fleet commander then calmly and collectedly issued simple and clear orders. The orders issued by the commander were immediately repeated one by one, and transmitted to the commanders of each unit. At this time, the situation remained unchanged from when the British warships were discovered, and there was no change in the quietness. The enemy mistakenly believed that our ships were their partners. They absolutely did not expect that the German fleet would come across the ocean to this place.</p>
<p>Commencing the Attack</p>
<p>It was determined at the time that the distance between us and the enemy destroyer in front was at most fifteen kilometers, and the distance to the aircraft carrier was twenty-four kilometers.</p>
<p>As we stared at the thick black smoke billowing from the enemy ship's funnels, the enemy ship suddenly changed its direction of advance. This was because the enemy had only now realized they had mistaken us, so they decided to change formation.</p>
<p>However, for an aircraft carrier, which is not easy to turn around, it was too late. The enemy aircraft carrier had already fallen within the range of our main guns. Just as it was trying to escape, our commander shouted loudly, "Fire!"</p>
<p>Our guns had long been aimed at the enemy ship, continuing to move and shift with the enemy ship's movements.</p>
<p>The cannons continued to roar incessantly. The medium-range guns concentrated their firepower on the destroyers in front. All the large-caliber guns were firing at the aircraft carrier. The first shell was forcefully launched.</p>
<p>We all quietly held our breath, each looking for their target. We could clearly see that the aircraft attempting to take off were desperately struggling on the aircraft carrier's deck.</p>
<p>"Good, the time has come!"</p>
<p>Who shouted this first, and what exactly we shouted to the other parts of our comrades, I can't remember now. But I only clearly remember that when we saw the first shell accurately hitting the enemy ship, we shouted "hurrah" in unison! The shell destroyed the aircraft on the deck, which completely deprived the enemy of its main, strong weapon on which it relied.</p>
<p>Looking around, each brother's surprised smile was tinged with a faint red. The enemy ship was increasing its speed, but even though the deck was collapsing, it was still struggling to launch aircraft. In a short time, the aircraft carrier was hit by one fatal shot after another, so that not a single aircraft on the carrier was spared from being shot down into the water. Flames were raging from the turrets, and the sulphurous gunpowder smoke gradually enveloped the entire body of the enemy ship. This smoke quickly expanded in all directions, while also moving towards the stern. At the same time, our ship was approaching the enemy ship foot by foot. The enemy seemed to have suffered too many fatal blows.</p>
<p>The Desperate Struggle of the Enemy Destroyer</p>
<p>This time, the destroyer seemed to want to play some new tactics. The destroyer in front gradually increased its speed and tried to form a diagonal shape from the left side of the ship. It released a thick smoke screen, causing a pitch-black fog to drift over the sea. It was very obvious that this was an attempt to allow the aircraft carrier to escape our pursuit. Another enemy destroyer was also desperately releasing a smoke screen to protect this important aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Sure enough, protected by the smoke screen, it was able to temporarily escape our accurate artillery fire, and in an instant, the silhouette of the aircraft carrier disappeared, and only a huge, pitch-black smoke was drifting over the sea with the wind. Our cannons had to temporarily stop roaring. We were assuming the posture of firing, calmly waiting for the smoke to dissipate, waiting for the opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>However, the smoke screen was torn into strips by the wind. Therefore, our artillery fire and machine guns began to pounce again. In a short time, raging fires broke out everywhere, so it can be determined that our shells accurately hit the target.</p>
<p>It's a pity that our destroyers didn't get to participate in this tragic battle. If the destroyers had participated in this battle, it would definitely have ended faster. However, our two warships, the "Gneisenau" and "Scharnhorst", would never give up until they had completely destroyed the enemy. To achieve this goal, it is essential not to relax our vigilance against the enemy, nor to give them a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Shells were flying out of the cannon mouths one after another, non-stop. Our ship was going at full speed, advancing forward. The scene of the naval battle was reaching its climax at this instant, truly possessing unparalleled poetic and dramatic meaning. The azure sky, boundless and infinite, enveloped this vast sea. Because the sky was very clear, the outline of the battle could be clearly delineated with the naked eye. It was only in front that there was a dense wall of water spreading from starboard to port. In front of this towering wall of water, the enemy aircraft carrier had just popped out, and it always felt like the carrier wanted to escape the crystal palace.</p>
<p>The artificial smoke emitted by the British destroyer was heavy and strong, churning. It was very much like the thick smoke of burning gasoline. Our warship, after each shell was fired, quietly brought out some brownish-yellow sulfur smoke.</p>
<p>Look at the enemy's side, the exploding grenades are constantly stirring up high columns of water. The water columns are black at first, but turn white in an instant, and at this moment, they are also mixed with flashes of red flame that appear from time to time, while the surging smoke is expanding, rising. This is the achievement of a direct hit that brings death and destruction.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Carrier Heading Towards Sinking</p>
<p>The enemy ship was completely surrounded by flames. No matter how much it wanted to escape or dodge, everything would be ineffective in the face of the accurate artillery fire and exquisite tactics of the German warships. Then, our artillery fire was concentrated on the enemy destroyer. But the enemy destroyer was very agile, and with a dodge, escaped our attacking fire. However, repeated dodging was useless at this moment. We continued to bombard them non-stop, one shell after another landing beside the enemy ship. The excellence of our military gunnery was proven here. During the most intense period of the battle, the commander repeatedly praised the skillful shooting of his gunners.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called battle is not just one side's actions, but also the other side's actions. Next to our warship, high columns of water were often blasted up by enemy shells. The enemy aircraft carrier and destroyer still did not admit defeat. The destroyer was still trying to rally its spirits, frantically working on defense. Perhaps they were expecting the situation to improve.</p>
<p>The enemy destroyer disappeared after repeatedly pulling up a smoke screen from behind. Just when you thought it had disappeared, it suddenly burst out of the smoke screen, exposing its body, opening all its launch tubes, firing torpedoes at our warship, and immediately, like lightning, fled back into the shadows of the smoke screen. At that time, our warship sounded the siren for torpedo alert every time, and thanks to extremely skillful driving techniques, it was fortunate enough to escape the dangerous net of most of the enemy's torpedoes.</p>
<p>Our medium-range guns now concentrated all their fire, and began a joint bombardment of the enemy destroyer leaning towards the front left. The shells flew towards the sea like raindrops. In an instant, a large mass of water stood up in front. The British destroyer then silently fell into the burning flames. In a moment, this destroyer's fate came to an end. We saw that this destroyer could no longer move a step.</p>
<p>The artillery fire paused slightly, and upon careful inspection, the enemy destroyer was turning somersaults, tilting into an acute angle. Therefore, we stopped our attack on this destroyer. The enemy destroyer tilted, and then completely sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>During this period, our cannons had not slackened in their fierce attack on the enemy aircraft carrier. The enemy aircraft carrier had lost its will to fight and wanted to escape. But, it was already too late. The main factor determining the course of this battle was only our fleet.

<h3>The Actual Situation of Henan Refugees in Exile</h3>
<p>Since last autumn, ragged refugees have been continuously crossing the perilous provincial border from Henan to Shanxi in the cold wind. According to figures released by the Shanxi Provincial Government in mid-January, the number has reached more than 100,000. These refugees have all fled due to the recent expansion work of the Chongqing and Communist armies. Because the economy has been blockaded, their poverty is indescribable. Hearing of the peace in the Shanxi Provincial Government area, they flocked here. The Shanxi Provincial Government extended a warm helping hand to these Henan compatriots teetering on the brink of starvation, issuing an instruction in the name of the provincial governor, and formulating temporary relief measures for refugees entering Shanxi Province. It allocated one million yuan and promptly began relief efforts. In response to the provincial government's relief efforts, Sino-Japanese organizations from Taiyuan City to various other places became active. The situation of Henan farmers entering Shanxi Province is truly a tragic history. At a time when China is participating in the Greater East Asia War, we believe that we must find a way to provide relief to this scene of widespread suffering.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two routes for Henan farmers fleeing into Shanxi: south and east. Those with a little money come from the Wuhan line, going north along the line to Shijiazhuang, and then entering Shanxi along the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line. The situation of these farmers entering Shanxi by car is better. braving the severe cold, being swept by wind and sand, crossing the perilous provincial border, and entering the North China highlands of Shanxi, these groups of farmers are scattered and displaced, suffering immensely. The reporter visited farmers in Changzhi City who had fled here from the south and learned about their situation. The farmers, suffering from hunger and cold, relied on the hope of the rumored paradise, mustered the courage to drag their tired and stiff feet across the Yellow River, and arrived in the Shanxi Provincial Government area.</p>
<p>Approaching the provincial border, what appeared before them and blocked their way was a series of towering mountains and ridges. They had no choice but to struggle forward. Women and children, exhausted, some crying loudly, the whimpering of infants placed in cages pierced the hearts of this group of mourners. The old farmers, thinking that happiness was on the other side of the mountain and only death awaited them here, mustered their courage and encouraged the group to move forward. Although there were hundreds of people in this group, they were not all "from the same village", but gathered from several nearby villages. They carried odds and ends in their hands and heavy loads on their backs. Those with wives took their wives, and those with children led their children. In the dark of night, they secretly said goodbye to their villages and set out, avoiding surveillance. Encouraging and helping each other, on the road to the peaceful areas of Shanxi, they met farmers from other villages who had the same idea. In this way, farmers from several villages gathered into a large group. Now, I will report further on the actual situation of Henan refugees.</p>
<p>The land in Henan is not barren. The Yellow River flows through it, creating a naturally fertile area suitable for cultivation. However, during last year's rainy season, heavy rains caused the Yellow River to flood, and the enemy-controlled area from the west bank of the New Yellow River to Anhui Province, a large area of 120 kilometers, was submerged by the turbulent flood. 2.4 million residents were teetering on the brink of death, and infectious diseases were extremely rampant, with tens of thousands of people killed or injured. From this time on, the people of Henan began to take refuge in peaceful areas one after another. The flooding of the Yellow River was not only a great misfortune for the people of Henan, but also the Chongqing military's positions were completely submerged by the flood. Two-thirds of the Chongqing military's positions at Daqingguan on the opposite bank of Puzhou were submerged, and thousands of soldiers, most of the grain, and weapons were washed away by the flood. Due to the flooding in the southern Henan area, the enemy's military supplies were severely lacking. The army levied on the spot, arousing resistance from the people. The military discipline within the Sun Tongxuan camp of the Central Army was lax, and enemy soldiers who crossed the Yellow River and fled to Shanxi, where materials were abundant and prices were low, increased day by day.</p>
<p>The disaster that befell Henan was compounded by a major drought in the western area. The crops in Luoyang and western Henan were tragically reduced to 60% of the previous year, and the general farmers were extremely poor. The government did not seek any relief measures for this, and the land tax was adopted in kind, pricing wheat, which was then five yuan a catty, at twenty-eight cents a catty. The people, having lost their only food source, were extremely resentful of the authorities' policies. Consequently, farmers in Yuxian County turned into bandits and committed rampant acts. In the Fangcheng and Dadian areas, the people were starving and their lives were hanging by a thread. In late July, 1,500 people rioted, attacking various offices to demand the abolition of the in-kind tax system. The floods and drought in Henan created this miserable living hell, with the people wandering in the wilderness, engaging in bloody争 to争 for a single piece of fruit. Poverty became even more severe during the autumn harvest. The harvest at the end of September was less than 10% or 20% of the previous year's. Even this extremely meager harvest was forcibly confiscated by the enemy army. The residents did not even have the freedom to swallow a single grain of wheat. Under this abuse, the farmers in the villages heard that there was a place to live and work in peace under the new regime, so they abandoned their desolate hometowns and fled to southern Shanxi one village after another.</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime was extremely panicked by the people's flight to southern Shanxi, forcibly immigrating them to the northwest and pleading with Chongqing to implement some relief measures, but it was nothing more than a drop in the bucket, to no avail. Foreign reporters in the Chongqing area also reported the following about the famine in Henan:</p>
<p>The Chongqing army forcibly moved the refugees in Henan to the northwest to serve as labor for development. Those who fled were endless, and those who died of hunger and cold along the Longhai Railway were numerous. Therefore, the movement of refugees to areas outside the province was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The tragic situation of the Henan refugees is generally as described above. According to recent intelligence, not only is there a drought south of the Yellow River, but the tragic situation north of the Yellow River has also been heard of. The Chongqing military expansion work centered on the Lingchuan area released the captured refugees because they could not afford to feed them. These exiled refugees also flowed into the peaceful areas of Shanxi. The Shanxi Provincial Government is seeking the following measures for the temporary relief of refugees from Henan Province with the cooperation of the provincial people, and the magistrates of each county are making the county people fully implement them:</p>
<p>(1) The county people should automatically provide relief and donate gold ornaments to contribute to the fundraising.</p>
<p>(2) Absolutely prohibit inhuman acts.</p>
<p>(3) Provide jobs for those seeking employment.</p>
<p>(4) Patients will be accommodated and treated in hospitals in each county.</p>
<p>(5) Protect the elderly, young, women, and children. (Translated from the February 11th issue of the Tokyo Mainichi Newspaper)</p>
<p>Japanese transport ships, after many hardships, came fully loaded with munitions and provisions, continuously supplying the fleet in combat, making the greatest contribution.</p>

<h3>The Need for Genuine Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>— Chuan Wo</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yuan Tao's article "We Need Enthusiasm" in the newspaper on the 12th, I felt that there were still some unsaid parts, and I would like to say a few more words.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Tao said: "What we need are people who are enthusiastic and motivated, people who are harmonious, and people who are always smiling, because only they can turn a cold society into a warm society." While I agree that we need people who are enthusiastic and motivated, I dare not fully believe that people who are "harmonious" and "always smiling" can turn a "cold society into a warm society". People who are "harmonious" can indeed sometimes give people they come into contact with a feeling of "warmth like spring", but this is not necessarily due to their inner enthusiasm, perhaps it is just a pretense of kindness; because they hold the doctrine of "harmony" — that is, they hold a "round" attitude towards life — then they must be smooth in their ways in society, all-knowing and all-pleasing, showing off clever smiles, pretending to be diligent: on the surface they can be seen as "kind gentlemen", but in reality, they may be true hypocrites who use their tricks to secretly seek personal gain. As for some people who are "always smiling", their "way of life" is certainly not weaker than those who are "harmonious", and "smiling tigers" and "smiling daggers" even describe the hearts of these people. The people of the Two-Faced Country described in Jing Hua Yuan, whose front "face" is full of spring breeze, welcoming people with smiles, and whose back "face" is fierce and frightening, give them a good portrayal.</p>
<p>Of course, these hypocrites can only represent a part of the people who are "harmonious" and "always smiling". There are also some who treat people with sincerity and have no malice at all, but society will not become "warm" because of these kind people, because in a disorderly society, tormented by life and for the sake of competing for a few loaves of bread, humans will become more selfish and ruthless. Therefore, in a world where the majority of people are on the verge of a "cold" predicament, how can the "elegant concessions" and "smiling harmony" of a minority give people a large amount of enthusiasm to make this society inevitably "warm"?</p>
<p>To truly make this society "warm", I believe, we should wait until all workers have no fear of hunger and cold, and everyone can go from selfishness to public service, working together for the same goal. To achieve this goal, we must rely on those who have a heart of universal love, willing to contribute their own to the greater self, but who are by no means sycophantic to society and cater to everyone. Of course, they are "harmonious" and "always smiling" to the good elements in society, sending out "warm" warmth, but they are merciless to the pests in society, severely annihilating them, and why not give them "cold" chill? Only such people can give society genuine enthusiasm. We need genuine enthusiasm, not empty enthusiasm!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>Treat others' suffering as if it were your own; therefore, when others have difficulties, you should try to relieve them.</p>
<p>Those who become depressed and negative because of one or two failures are not heroes.</p>
<p>If you do not consider the effectiveness of your work, but only plan for the rewards of your work, you lose the greatest meaning of work.</p>
<p>A person who cries before laughing can live a valuable life.</p>
<p>Work requires determination; failure is in front, success is behind.</p>
<p>Hardship is good medicine, ease is poison.</p>
<h3>Fourth Place Winner in the January Essay Contest: My Life</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhongqing</p>
<p>In this vortex, the times are turbulent and fluctuating.</p>
<p>The result of war is upheaval and destruction; the reward of peace is prosperity and construction.</p>
<p>War symbolizes the arrival of calamity. My family was destroyed. It was by no means like the internal development of the collapse of Ba Jin's "Home", but rather an external blow. Of course, the Dao [Way] was unavoidable. I lost my intimate parents from my childhood and my vibrant, spring-like family, and embarked on a path of upheaval and displacement.</p>
<p>When a corner of the city transitioned from war to peace, I began to struggle for survival in the crowd of all living beings. In the vast city, there were no prominent relatives, and even fewer friends of high status, only two brothers relying on each other for life!</p>
<p>As a result of my efforts, I found a job. No matter how small or insignificant this position may be, in short, I have temporarily solved a few difficulties: first, I won't be wandering on the streets for the time being; second, I am economically self-sufficient and will no longer rely on others.</p>
<p>The type of work is in pawnshops, where the business relies on pledges. The method of obtaining surplus can be said to be similar to that of banks, both using interest to maintain operating expenses, but in some forms, there are significant differences. For example, banks mainly engage in mortgage lending, while pawnshops mainly deal with pawned clothing and accessories.</p>
<p>Speaking of pawnshops, they have always been looked down upon and scorned by people in society. Yes, to some extent, it is a place that exploits the poor, but based on the principle of adjustment, it still retains its semi-charitable nature; because for people who desperately need money, when they are at a loss and can't think of a way, pawning is still their only option.</p>
<p>The main business is pawning clothes and accessories, so most of the people we come into contact with are not wealthy. They come as if embracing the belief of "having every prayer answered" and entrusting endless hopes. What we hear and see is either tragic complaints or nagging requests for help. If both parties are willing to compromise, there are few quarrels. But when it comes to redemption, there is a kind of psychological effect, thinking that they are in a dominant position, regarding pawnshops as usurers, and even scolding and resorting to violence is often seen. These kinds of unfortunate events are fundamentally impossible to eliminate.</p>
<p>On a freezing morning when the north wind is howling and the temperature is below zero, people are still sleeping in their quilts seeking a moment of warmth, perhaps still pursuing dreams, but unexpectedly, a small wave has already started outside:</p>
<p>"Hey! I want to redeem something!"</p>
<p>"Oh my! It's so cold today, hurry up and let me redeem it!" Even more urgent.</p>
<p>Who doesn't crave warmth? Who isn't happy to huddle indoors to keep warm? In this freezing weather where the north wind howls and water turns to ice, people rush around, scrape together money, and hurry to redeem the clothes they pawned due to the threat of hunger, all to resist the biting cold.</p>
<p>When the authorities post the allocated quantity for this period at the rice shops, the quiet streets are stirred up, and at the same time, changes are taking place in our business: because the general public, who mainly rely on household rice as their staple food, how can they gather the full rice price at once? Therefore, pawnshops are regarded as temporary regulators.</p>
<p>"Hey! Quickly pawn something!"</p>
<p>"Let me pawn something to buy household rice!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just enough to feed half the stomach, it arouses fervent prayers.</p>
<p>But there are also those who, due to buying rations, suffer the unexpected loss of paying extra interest, and say nonchalantly: "Making money for your pawnshop!" Ah! When they say these words, it is also when I feel ashamed inside.</p>
<p>Having worked for four or five years, based on what I have learned and analyzed, pawn customers can be roughly divided into four categories:</p>
<p>Category A: Destitute, accounting for 50%;</p>
<p>Category B: Hidden poor, accounting for 30%;</p>
<p>Category C: Gambling and entertainment, accounting for 15%;</p>
<p>Category D: Others, accounting for 5%;</p>
<p>Category A: Most of them are truly destitute who have breakfast but no lunch, mostly laborers or small vendors.</p>
<p>Category B: Mostly salarymen, because their income does not meet their expenses, they have to run a deficit every month. Borrowing from friends is a matter of face and difficult to ask, and even if they borrow, it is another problem. Only resorting to pawning is more convenient, so they also account for a large number.</p>
<p>Category C: This type is the only embellishment in society. As a result of urban prosperity, gambling and entertainment will inevitably follow. Shanghai has many clubs and entertainment venues, and hedonists will naturally flock to them.</p>
<p>Category D: This category includes various minorities who are caused by unexpected events.</p>
<p>The above ratio is not fixed and varies depending on the location. For example, in Nanshi, category C accounts for 70% or 80% of the total.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Shanghai's prosperity is built on the poor." This statement has considerable basis. Taking a walk through the slum areas, or taking a stroll along the sides of the streets, the huge character "pawn" catches the eye everywhere, as densely as teeth on a comb. Does this mean that Shanghai is prosperous? No! Absolutely not! It is enough to represent the needs of the lower class of society. Conversely, it is also enough to prove the economic depletion of society.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is correct to say that Shanghai's prosperity is built on a layer of sand!</p>
<p>(Note: Mr. Qu is currently an employee of a pawnshop)</p>
<p>When we study, we should value thorough mastery. Not seeking thorough mastery, but only seeking quick success, is the greatest malady in studying. It is like eating food, only eating a lot without chewing carefully, the result will inevitably lead to indigestion and become a food stagnation. From this, we can know that the effort of studying does not lie in quick success, but only in being meticulous and continuous. Being able to be continuous, then even if what you read in a day is not much, or for those who have a job and are busy, they don't have much free time to read books every day, they can only steal some time to read when they are busy, and what they read is of course very little, but over time, accumulating day by day, naturally there will be insights, and naturally you will feel progress. If you seek speed at every moment, then you will only do a sloppy job at every moment, no matter how much you recite every day, what use is it for learning?</p>
<h3>A Few Words</h3>
<p>— Qi Wu</p>
<p>Confucian self-discipline, Buddhist compassion, Christian love...all tell us to forget the "small self" and get rid of selfish and self-interested hearts.</p>
<p>Buddhist scriptures say: "No-self is achieved through tolerance."</p>
<p>Only by being able to tolerate can you do what others cannot.</p>
<p>Modern citizens should not only be able to achieve this point of "no-self," but should also keep "the country" and "the nation" in mind at all times.</p>
<p>A. B. Alcott said: "Not knowing one's own ignorance is the most unfortunate disease of ignorance."</p>
<p>This saying is truly a head-on blow to those who think they are smart!</p>
<p>However, those who think they are smart will not wake up from this.</p>
<p>"Self-respect" and "self-praise" are completely different.</p>
<p>However, most people do not know "self-respect" and only know "self-praise," and they take "self-praise" as "self-respect."</p>
<p>This is just like how people confuse "respect" and "flattery," and reverse "self-deprecation" and "self-abasement."</p>
<p>A difference of a hair's breadth leads to a loss of a thousand miles. This can be seen very clearly from here.</p>
<h3>Doing Small Business</h3>
<p>— Tianming Painting</p>
<p>A Word of Wisdom</p>
<h3>Absolutely Avoid Sporadic Effort</h3>
<p>— Qiji</p>
<p>There are many methods of studying. Some focus on specialization, some focus on broad reading; some choose a topic that they find most interesting, and carefully read all related books; some have no goals and read good books when they encounter them, and record them when they are in the mood. Although everyone's methods are different, if you want to make progress in learning, the most important thing is to have perseverance.</p>
<p>Studying is the same as doing other things. The first thing you need is perseverance. If you haven't finished reading one book and start reading another, it's like not finishing one thing and doing another, pulling things in different directions and with no clue. The result will definitely be in vain. Zeng Wenzhenggong once said: "When reading, memory is ordinary, this is not worth worrying about, what is worrying about is, first of all, fearing the lack of perseverance..." It can be seen that lack of perseverance is the greatest enemy of scholars.</p>
<h3>Happiness</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>Failure is the beginning of all success. Don't be discouraged by failure. If you fail, you must not let your spirit be scattered. Consider the past as dead, and the future as a new birth. Struggle to gain vitality! Creation brings life! Happiness can only be found through hard work and struggle.</p>
<p>Happiness and pain are opposite and cyclical. There is happiness, and there is also pain. Therefore, pain and happiness coexist. If there is no pain, happiness cannot truly exist.</p>
<p>If you take work as an interest and don't care about the gains and losses of success or failure, I think even if you have no free time, you can have the happiness of forgetting both bitterness and joy. Why? Because as long as a person is interested in the work they do, and concentrates their mind and energy on the work, even if there is no recreation, they can find true happiness in the work!</p>
<h3>Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(Sixteen)</p>
<p>Strangely, in this deeper sense, how little it had changed. The boys were a little more polite; bullying was no longer done openly; lies and deceit were perhaps a little more prevalent. There was a truer friendship between master and boy—less hero-worship on the one side, less humbug on the other. One of the new masters, just come from Oxford, even allowed the Sixth Form to call him by his Christian name. Chips did not approve of this; indeed, he was a little apt to disapprove of things. “He’ll perhaps be actually—er—signing himself on the term reports—er—‘Yours affectionately, So-and-so’?” he told somebody.</p>
<p>During the General Strike of 1926, Brookfield boys loaded food vans. After it was over, Chips felt more stirred than he had done since the War. Something had happened, the final significance of which could not yet be estimated. But at least one thing was clear: England had burned her house down once again in her own fire. There was an American visitor on Speech Day that year, who made a special point of the enormous financial loss the country had sustained through the strike. Chips replied. “Yes, but—er—think of the advertising.”</p>
<p>“Advertising?” “Well, wasn’t it—er—advertisement of a kind, and not—bad advertisement either? The whole world looking on for a week—er—and not a shot fired—not a life lost! Wouldn’t your country—er—have spilled a bit more blood—er—in the same circumstances?”</p>
<p>Roars of laughter. Wherever he went and whatever he said, there was always laughter. He had acquired a reputation as a wit, and people expected him to be funny. Whenever he stood up to speak at a meeting, or even when he was only talking across a table, people prepared themselves and waited with pleasant expectancy. They listened in the mood to be amused, so that it was easy to amuse them. Sometimes they laughed before he said anything at all. “Old Chips is in good form,” they would say afterwards. “Marvellous, the way he always sees the funny side of things. . . .” (43) Social Service</p>
<h3>Who Doesn't Have Parents? A Painful Letter</h3>
<p>(Letter to the Editor) I am an apprentice with limited knowledge, originally from Jurong, Jiangsu. My father's name is Wang Houqing, and I have two older sisters and two younger brothers, a total of seven people in my family. Before the war, my father worked in printing, and the family relied on my father for support. However, since the August 13th Incident, my hometown was bombarded by artillery fire, and our family was separated from our beautiful hometown. When we arrived near Huangniba Village in Nanjing, my beloved father was separated from the whole family. Although we witnessed the situation at the time, we were unable to rescue him. Recalling the past, I feel endless pain. Time flows like an arrow, and six years have passed. However, my father has not returned, and there is no news. In this grief, I have no choice but to ask your newspaper to ask people in society, if anyone knows the whereabouts of my father, please notify No. 95 Shandong Road or call 991471, so that the family can be reunited. I will be endlessly grateful. Wang Qingyan bows.</p>
<h3>Academy Physician Preferential Treatment for Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(1) Zhu Yuan from the Fitness Academy at No. 1491 Ansi Road wrote that the academy recently launched a health and fitness program for elementary and middle school teachers. Those who participate in the equipment class, boxing class, or soft exercise class with a certificate from this newspaper are very welcome and will receive preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Yang Yanhe of No. 80 Anshun Lane has responded to this newspaper since last year, providing compassionate assistance to elementary school teachers. According to school certification, a total of over ten people have received treatment. In addition to charging a transportation fee of five yuan for each house call for two people, all other consultation fees and administrative fees are completely waived. This good deed continues to be carried out, and the time is still from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. House calls can be notified by phone before 12:00 noon, and the number is 46774.</p>
<h3>Free School Places in Various Schools</h3>
<p>(1) The Pudong-Xiamen Chinese Workers' Obligatory School on Aidoa Road is scheduled to open on March 8. Out-of-school workers aged 14 to 40, regardless of gender, from illiterate to upper primary school level, can register for admission. Tuition is free, and classes are held from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM every day. Brochures are available upon request.</p>
<p>(2) The private Jingcheng Elementary School still has a surplus of fourteen free school places, but only for higher grades. Those with excellent character and academic performance and a poor family background are urged to register quickly. The school address is No. 9 Xicang Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, Xicang Road, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Chinese Children's Welfare Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Poor Children Before Deadline</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association distributed winter clothing to poor children throughout the city. With the assistance of various social groups, the distribution was widespread and is now scheduled to end at the end of this month. There are still more than 400 poor children who have been verified and have not received winter clothing. They are urged to go to the association to receive it as soon as possible to avoid missing out. Anyone who needs winter clothing can also apply for it before the 28th of this month.</p>
