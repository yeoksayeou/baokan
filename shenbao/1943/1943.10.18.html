<p>社評</p>
<h3>敎養街頭流浪兒童</h3>
<p>本市市民福利協會，日前舉行冬季會員大會，討論若干建議案件，其中關於改善交通建議，我們在昨日短評中指陳目前交通秩序，有迅謀改善的必要，為旅客便利而服務。鐵道交通方面，如果華中鐵道公司力量單薄，未能全部整頓，則市政當局與各有關機關必須協力解決，不能熟視無睹而使行旅萬分痛苦。</p>
<p>其次，該會建議中尙有「會同慈善團體籌款，將街頭流浪兒童收容救濟」一案，決定由該會組織「流浪兒童敎養委員會」，專責進行。我們對於街頭流浪兒童的救濟敎養，向來主張應視為比較積極的社會福利事業，羣策羣力去辦理。今年四月四日兒童節，我們會在社評中特別提出街頭流浪兒童的收留敎養，是十分急迫的工作，盼望各慈幼福幼的慈善團體共同協力擔負這一責任。伺時呼籲社會各界有錢出錢，助成這件有積極意義培養民族的重大工作。期望明年兒童節日不再有貧丐兒童流浪街頭的現象。復於六月三十日我們在社評中，對於街頭流浪兒童的收留敎養問題，再度提出，盼望關係方面加以注意，迅籌收容敎養，為國家多保幾分元氣，也就是替社會消除幾分危機。</p>
<p>我們為什麽對於街頭流浪兒童的敎養問題，特別重視呢？因為兒童是國家的命脈，國家來日之氣運如何，須視今日兒童之敎養如何。街頭流浪兒童與一般家庭的兒童，有着同樣的聰明智慧，不過因受貧苦環境的壓迫，無家可歸而度流浪生活。誰無子女，誰無愛護子女之心，我們應稍移愛護子女之心，以愛護流浪兒童。兒童的弱小心靈，都是一片純潔天眞，完全受環境的支配，近朱赤，近墨黑，童丐小偷，何嘗是天生賤骨。小孩原無過失，實社會病態有以促使之。</p>
<p>我們都忝為社會的一份子，因此，對於無辜的流浪兒童，已經失去父母敎養的子女，即當視為大家的子女，大家都有敎養的責任。人羣原是不能脫離社會而生存，對於任何福利大衆的社會事業，每個社會的構成份子，必須貢獻最大的熱忱毅力共同協力，務使社會福利事業，順利進行。况且，敎養流浪兒童，尤其是積極性的社會福利事業呢？</p>
<p>現在市民福利協會巳經提出建議案，組織專門委員會籌議進行，我們於竭誠盼望該會積極推動之餘，略貢管見數點，以備參考：</p>
<p>該會係民間團體，論性質是倡導與要求有關全體市民的福利事業為主，不擔負慈善救濟實際的責任。然而敎養流浪兒童一事，並非消極的慈善救濟，而寓有積極的培養民族元氣，已如前述，該會於設計與策動工作以外，並應擔負實際收留與敎養責任，主持辦理，向時，商請有關官廳予以充分協助。</p>
<p>舉辦社會事業，事前雖必有週密考慮而決定計劃，但執行時即應出之敏捷，迅赴事功，說到做到。經費假定以二百萬元為目標，時間假定以六個月為第一期，收留人數假定若干，計劃妥當，立耶開始實施，第一期辦有成效，繼續第二期，如此不難悉數收留。但敎養地區，最好選擇農村區城，物價較廉，風俗淳厚，待收留後逐漸移往，實施敎養。</p>
<p>養的方面，維持最低限度　的營養與衣的溫暖。敎的方面，絕對嚴格施以知識與體格訓練，同時，為適應經費困難情形，以期逐漸自給目足，團體本身於一面敎養以外，一面辦理輕簡生產事業，酌定適齡學童，以一部分時間從事生產工作，旣為團體生產，複為自身充實技藝，為來日就業與服務社會的張本。</p>
<h3>日首相秉政兩年　已確立決戰體制　奠定大東亞戰爭勝利基礎</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　十八日為日東倏內閣成立二周年紀念日。溯自中日事變發生以來，日本歷代內閣雖竭力調整國務與統帥之關係，但至東條內閣，始獲完全解決。自東條首相兼任陸相後，政戰兩略已告一致，現內閣係首相兼攝一切措置，並傾其全力作戰，當開戰以後，戰略據點仍未確保時，首相傾其全副力量作戰，故國內政務巳不能　分兼顧。自大東亞戰爭初期，戰事收獲偉大戰果，必勝不敗之戰略據點已確立後，首相始傾力解決內政問題。東條內閣經三次改組以後，巳漸成為決戰內閣，茲介紹東條內閣過去情勢如次：</p>
<p>內閣三度改組</p>
<p>東條內閣可分為三　，第一期東條首相自在議會答覆美國於昭和十年（民國三十年）十一月二十六日發出之最後通　以後，首相已整備日美　戰。大東亞省設立後，湯澤內務次官被　為大臣，東鄕外相辭職，谷情報局總裁任外相，前靑木藏相任大東亞相，此時可稱為東條內閣之第一期改組，東條內閣在此第一期改組時期中，曾提出確立　贊議會及實施推薦制之衆院議員　選舉，創設　政會，又在政府內部實行裁員，設置大東亞省推進內政，以適應戰爭第二期。第一次之內閣改組，不可謂為東條內閣根本改組。</p>
<p>積極革新內政</p>
<p>其後為適應各方情勢，乃有第二次之改組，東條首相曾於去春召開通常議會，閉幕以後，經愼重考慮後，乃於本年四月廿日實施改革舉國一致之內閣，由駐華大使重光就任外相，大政　政會政務調查會長小崎任　相，大政　政會總務國務相橋田邦彥任文相，　贊會副總裁後藏任國務相。東條內閣第二次改組，於此巳吿完成，由是政府與　政會及　贊會三位一體，在內閣中樞巳名實相符，且現其　態。南北太平洋上之戰事，自本來以來曾趨激烈，此際東條內閣曾於六月中旬，舉行第八十二屆臨時議會，提出整備企業等並增强戰力，並從速推進增强戰略施策。同時東條首相在議會發出施政演說，闡明根本改訂中日條約及援助獨立，復於本年七月訪問泰國，並在昭南檢閱印度國民軍，巳使緬甸菲律賓先後完成獨立。</p>
<p>發揮國家總力</p>
<p>自此以後，大東亞戰爭進入空軍決戰階段，故大量生產飛機，實為當前之急務。同時歐洲方面自巴特里奧政權棄信背盟以後，日德義等軸心國家更團結一致，為完成戰爭目的，乃各充分發揮其國家之總力。東條內閣為應付現在及將來之戰局起見，曾於九月二十日召開閣議，通過當前國政運營網要省遞信省等，同時在經濟文化社會各方面亦從速澈底推進戰時應策。處此大東亞戰爭之決戰　勢中，東條首相政務雖極　忙，但政　亦極康泰，現一億國民於東條內閣成立二週年之際，除籲請信　政府外，復於東倏首相領導之下，團結一致共同奮鬥，爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>華北日軍　予共軍重創　中共經濟上受致命打擊</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　華北日軍某前綫十七日電，自華北日軍發動秋季攻勢以來，華北共軍巳呈支離　裂狀况，向太行山脈北部山岳地帶逃竄，刻正徬徨於飢饉綫上，其後日軍南下各部隊運用巧妙之誘導戰術，於各處予以重創，共軍第卄二團十五日向冀省某縣方面出擊，但遭日軍精銳部隊之攻擊，而告敗退，是役共軍參謀長陣亡，　官被俘，茲誌十五日之該方面戰况及戰果如左：（甲）日軍發見馬莊西南某村附近　有共軍第廿二團約三百人後，當即加以圍擊，經激戰後，共軍不支潰退，是役日軍　獲戰果，計共軍遺屍共八六具，被俘卅一人，日軍獲輕機槍一，擲彈筒一，步槍廿三，步槍彈五三六，迫擊砲彈九，手槍三，手槍彈二五六〇，手榴彈八另二，及其他軍馬多匹。（乙）日軍另一部隊於十四日拂曉，在棉鎭西南高地發見　軍百餘人，當即對之加以攻擊，除敵軍死　及被　外，　獲步槍八，步槍彈四八〇，手榴彈五十，及其他彈藥無算。</p>
<h3>米糧採銷處　月底結束</h3>
<p>十七日中央社電　糧食部米糧採銷總智理處為　管行政院糧食管理委員會所辦業務，負責辦理米糧統購統配事宜，因國府强化米糧統制機關，高度發揮商人自治能力，乃於本年七月將上項工作，令飭全國商業統制總會另設米糧統制委員會，繼續辦理，當經袁主任委員履登積極籌備以來，茲巳全部就緒，一切工作日內即將展開，是故該處業已全部　辦理結束，一切業務，至本月二十日即行截止，所有各項未　手　，亦限於本月底以前辦理淸楚，以便結束。</p>

<h3>聶伯河下游　戰事愈劇烈　蘇軍攻勢無甚進展</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據海通社訊：東綫各段戰事，自前日起復趨激烈，尤以中路與南路為甚，蘇軍不惜以大量兵力與物資，向各段德軍兵力較弱之地猛撲，蘇軍並模倣法國之戰術，前晶向奧爾　迤東進攻，先以各種軍器猛轟歷一小時之久，然後以六師兵力進攻此廣僅四公里之陣地，但結果仍為德守軍所擊退。蘇軍在突尼柯夫西北之進展亦受遏阻，戈美爾戰局無變化，列靑格勒方面僅有局部戰事，柴普魯巷區並無戰事，僅有飛　　　活動，窺見敵方所集中之軍隊甚衆。尼普貝特洛夫斯克西北，預期敵軍進攻已久，敵軍果於前日拂曉發動攻勢，但迄無任何進展，戰事有愈演愈烈之勢。</p>
<h3>伏河北岸德軍　固守新陣地</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：英美軍於寸月十四日在伏爾托諾區與附近山區內，向德軍陣地作大規模之進攻，付出　大代價，以致克拉克將軍之美　五軍不得不將其部隊重加　頓。在前　西翼克拉克將軍之步兵與坦克車師　，雖擁有非常優越之重砲，但仍未能穿入德軍陣綫，或向北有所進展。德軍彈性防禦之戰術，再度證明其效力，敵在伏爾托諾河口以北之登陸部隊，雖有坦克車五十輛增援，但終未能擊破該處德軍陣地，僅在卡普亞之東西區，德擲　兵　數小時之劇戰後，不得不撒退至伏爾托諾平原東邊之高地，敵軍或正面進攻，或側面包圍，力圖奪取德軍之新陣地，但敵之企圖遭遇德軍有力而順利之反攻，以致敵軍被迫退至原陣地，沿由　　經亞平事山而通　羅馬之重要公路，敵已集中强大之步兵與坦克車隊，幷得來自甘波巴索（Camqobasso）之英加軍集團為　援　在該區作戰之德軍　於敵軍之　力與　　之威脅，　將沿公路一切重要設備加以炸毀，然後撒　至山間，公路若干處因此而被阻塞。英美軍沿被破　之公路謹愼前進。遭德砲隊破壞力强大之轟擊，同時德軍在目標準確之砲火保護下，由文察托羅（Vinchiaturo）撤退而　受敵軍之擾亂。</p>

<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據海通社訊，華盛帕消息靈通方面昨稱：美國務卿赫爾在莫斯科會議中提出之協約國戰後政策之計劃，將於該會開幕以前，先由參院批准。參　批准之結果，一方面可以謀略制勝坎德婁　導之　立派，另一方面足以增强赫爾在莫斯科會議中之地位。據美政界方面稱：　協約軍在義國早日獲　勝利，則赫爾之地位更將提高，羅斯福滿擬以佔領羅馬之消息，引起莫斯科會議之驚異，使低估義國戰事之價値之蘇　政治家為之悅服。</p>

<h3>煤業小賣商請求　改善煤斤配給　澈查黑市穩定煤業市况</h3>
<p>上　煤業小賣商聯合會，以欲穩定煤　市况，首須改善配給　　，及澈查從事黑市　　之煤商發表聲明云：緣大中　煤號來函謂，十月一日起，民生家事　煤暫行配給，消息傳播。羣起恐慌。。僉以民生家事甲煤配給　雖極微細，可是亦為小賣商（零售商）賴以支特的一項收入，若是停止，小　商勢將受到嚴重威脅，從業人員必將受到失業痛楚，所以召開食員代表火會，從長硏討應付辦法。</p>
<p>配給情形</p>
<p>大中國煤號配給我們的煤斤，除大中聯須扣取百分之五利潤外，同業商尙須扣取百分之五佣金，共扣除煤斤三成，供作水身自中買賣、在那時雖然經過重重的尅扣　剝奪，可是每月每家甲種還可以配得煤斤十餘噸，同時還有統制外炭（舊有存煤）可以　賣在當局規定百分之一十利潤下尙可勉强維持。到務來生活程度一天高一天，而配給煤斤反一天少一天，那時候我們的生活，也就一天一天的困難起來。</p>
<p>民生用煤</p>
<p>然不久，當局有廠商用煤和民生用煤的配給，大中聯煤號發給我們一種表格，囑將向來經營的廠商和民生客戶塡報，孰知他們拿了我們的表格，向常局領了煤斤，由他們去配給，那時除爭得了民生用煤（酒菜洗衣業）小部份外</p>
<p>其餘終被搶去，迄今年六月間，我們繼續交涉，結果答應自秋季開始，將全部民生用煤移交我們供給，同時家用煤項下亦不扣除三成。</p>
<p>突然停供</p>
<p>誰知依然如此，家事煤的數量反短小下來，。甲種每家每月祇一噸左右，少者數籮而已、在我們處境困苦的時候。正想請求當局救濟，大中聯煤給突然來了停止配給的信，頗使我們一籌莫展他們也沒有告訴停配的理由和期限，因之不得不呈請當局將配給機構改善，</p>
<p>改善配給</p>
<p>我們擴擬　請求當局·既分甲乙丙丁四級，不要再有同業商與小賣商之區別。因為兩者性實相同免少數人從中操縱，希望直接配予小賣商，不要輾轉加佣，以輕負担，嗣後除將家事煤派給各會員供銷外、其餘由聯合會集中經配，以求方針一致，而免弊端百出，但我們自相告誡，決不經營黑市外，並協　當局同為澈查，一面請求當局複查存煤，以免被人操縱壟斷。</p>

<h3>値得推薦的　舞·台·劇·「飄」</h3>
<p>「飄」的故事巾的四位主角，嘗遍了人生的滋味——生，愛，婚，死，　四個偉大基木的人生經騐。</p>
<p>「飄」搬上銀幕，轟動了全世界的影迷，而今日表演於「巴黎」的舞台，由一苦幹」傾力演出的話劇，無疑也轟動了全上海的劇迷。</p>
<p>這一次改編「飄」的是朱梵，導演是吳仞之，「飄」的劇本內容，已改為親切的「中國咪」，他所叙述的是北伐革命的血史，應擬的時代，是民國十五年左有，在風光絢斕的江南。</p>
<p>全劇共四務六塲五景，登塲演員近三十人。</p>
<p>第一幕　在衛家的花園裏，衛　春簽，親朋雲集，同時將宣布衛西里和韓美蘭的婚約，郝詩嘉盛裝赴宴，決心要將西里奪過來。</p>
<p>石揮的衛西里，常然是成功的一員，而藍蘭的郝思嘉，和莫愁的韓美蘭，也十分完美地表達了　二個女人不同的個性，一個剛强，一個溫柔。</p>
<p>王駿的韓查禮，一心醉迷於詩嘉，他要拿英雄的姿態，換取詩嘉的愛，而詩嘉却只寄望於西里。</p>
<p>郝仁的白瑞總，也在這裏出塲，他的外裂看，極似克拉克蓋巴爾，風度好，氣派好，這是北方新來的演員。</p>
<p>第二幕　是詩嘉為了嘔氣，在西里結婚以後，也下嫁了美蘭的弟弟查禮，無意中竟造成了了幕錯　錯絕的悲劇，新婚之夕，詩嘉動拒絕查禮同床不背放西里走，要他答應說一聲一愛」，而西里堅持要走，氣氛頗緊張，西里走後，新郞查禮的在新房裏得意忘形，王駿演來輕　之至，三姑媽（林蘇飾）的口口聲聲忘了如意油，又見幽默可愛。</p>
<p>查禮結婚不到三天，就殉了難，詩嘉成了新　的文君，西里夤夜亡命，臨別一剎那。石揮和藍蘭，莫愁三方面的依依不捨之悄，絲絲入扣。</p>
<p>第三幕　美　生產，詩嘉因為答應西里的囑托，幫助美蘭，瑞德來調侃，全劇充滿戰爭氣息，效果逼眞，藍蘭。莫愁的演技，有平均發展。</p>
<p>第四幕　思嘉已投入瑞德的懷抱西里千里　來，展開錯綜複雜的悲劇塲面，美蘭死去，詩嘉到最後徹悟祗有性情相同的人結婚，才有幸福她愛的應該是瑞德，不是西里，而西里却已開始沒有歸期的遠行了。——這裏，　蘭莫愁，石揮，郝仁，都有很大的敢穫。</p>
<p>還有未曾提到的演員如：日文，史原，沈敏，莊嚴，陳平，馬笑　，上官雲珠等，演出也都十分努力，値得贊賞。</p>
<p>「飄」是値得推荐的一個舞台劇，他給觀衆帶囘去沉重的心情—饑餓，嫉妬，愛與恨，歡樂與悲亥交織的人生情緒。（查民）</p>

<h3>難童敎養收容所　幼幼敎養院訪問記</h3>
<p>苦難中的發展</p>
<p>上海幼幼敎養院，在可紀念的八月一日成立以後，就開始有計劉的難　敎養工作，當時上海的環境在動亂的全國，無異世外桃源，物價比較起來還算平定，三百個苦兒難童的生活費，（每人每日三元）尙不怎樣困難，因此敎養事業，可以順利　行。可惜敎養院沒有固定的基金，有些必要的設備，仍是無法購辦，一切還是因陋就筒。為了前途發展計，不能不求經費的充足，所以在二十九年冬天，舉行第一次莫捐運動，預定目標為五萬元，可是結果，因為社會人士對於該院全持者的信任及鑒於難意敎養事業的重要。竟超過預地獲得十萬元以上。於是改進院內設備，並購備蒸汽鍋等，使敎和養兩方面都有改善，那時收容的難童恰為三百名，男生二百六十四名，女生三卞六名，其中最小者七歲，最大者十七歲。（三十年時特殊狀態中，而糧食間題，因洋米接濟困難及本市消耗增大等原因而日趨嚴重，上海灘民救濟協會對該院的給養補助也通告停止，在這種浪潮之下，該院決定造散一部份難童，那時孩子們的驚惶，可看他們自己的報告：</p>
<p>「貧窮，飢餓，　風般捲過上海，在這樣空前的脅迫前，幼幼教養院積存的款項也日日减少，於是也擬將三分之一的小明友遣敎囘家，以備留院院生多維持幾日。』</p>
<p>遣散的消息傳開了，全院似罩上層陰凄的暗影，孩子們心靈是脆弱的啊，他們收起臉上的紅霞，往日的嬉笑爭吵聲消滅了，三年級的牆角　，悄悄地擠坐着四五個似乎難分難捨的孩子，圍在一起哭泣啊！聽，每個敎室內不是有低低的竊語麽？「聽說要遣送幾十個人啊！」「我要餓死了，我要餓死了！」「叫我到　　去呢？」走廊中地舖上，幾顆　仰望天空，眼大大地睜着，似有無限恐怖與渴望</p>
<p>還好，經過該院與工部局見童保障科調查家境而遣散的，只是有家可歸的一小部份。同時，該院又發動了第二次募捐，預定目標為十五萬元，結果覽又超過了、得到三十萬以上、可見社會上對於難童敎養事業是何等關切啊，不過，那時上海物價巳開始不斷的上漲，維特難童的敎養仍是日益感到困難，三十一年冬發動第三次募捐，預定目標三十萬元，結果得到四五十萬元，不過經濟情况因物價狂漲而日臨困難，糧食問題尤為嚴重，於是在今年春天，共同決定分出一部份難童到鄉間去，經過縝密的討論和向四鄉查訪之後，終於選定崑山安亭徐公橋地方，在以前中華職輩敎育社主辦的鄉村改進會的原址，開辦幼幼敎養院分院，二月八日，陰歷大年初四，一百位小朋友負起自己的衣物，向徐公橋分院「移殖」去了。</p>
<p>艱苦困難沒有逼得他們灰心失望，反使他們的事業有了新的發展。最新的敎育</p>
<p>最新的教育</p>
<p>幼幼敎養院對於苦難的兒童，不只是像對乞兒那樣給些零錢冷飯算了，他們很忠誠地給孩子們以受最新敎育的機會。全院構成一個完全小學，共設六個學級，計分低，中，高三個階段，由教育主任一人及級任敎員四人（三。四。及五。六年級為　式）此外尙有科任教員。課程依照一般規定，對中高年級另授生產及實用料目，授以謀生技藝。敎學方面的特點是：</p>
<p>（一）經常實施各項公民訓練，尤以愛整潔，守秩序，備禮貌，勤諧書，肯服務、為五大訓練目標，並且續訂教材及競賽辦法，經常訓練與鼓勵。</p>
<p>（二）擴大兒童自治組織，成立「幼幼兒童團」，由各級推選優秀兒童一為代表，設有團部辦公處，每股或每組，聘教師為指導，各種活動及服務，都由該團計劉與領導。</p>
<p>（三）提倡課外活動，在課外時間內，闢各級敎室為閱覽，寫作，遊戲，棋子，　詠，戲劇等各種活動，另有台球，籃球，排球等運動設施，每週舉行一種活動比賽。</p>
<p>（四）實施勞動服務辦法，組織淸潔，伙食，洗衣，理髮，縫補，醫務各種勞動服務隊，隸屬於幼幼兒童團勞動股，凡中高級院生都要依據與趣及能力，自願參加一隊。</p>
<p>（五）為了集中加强指導自治活動，課外活動及勞働服務，又組織兒童活動指導委員會，由救職員推舉代表五人組織之，訂有活動曆，有計劉的推行各種活動。</p>
<p>低年級兒童，全日上課六小時，中及高年級則半日上課，半日工作，課業成旭，與外間優良小學不相上下，所以學業後可以直接升學，三十年度學業二十四人，除了就業之外，有七人考通蘇州中學，有六名改造難童中學。本年上海總院畢業七人，其中女生二人考進南洋女中，男生三人考進霞光中學，這些孩子又考取申報或新聞報的助學金，不過膳宿費用，仍由幼幼教養</p>
<p>在敎學的過程中，他們曾經發展難意許多特點：（一）學習態度的認眞，從來不讓一個問題不獲正確解決：（二）感應與記情力較强；（三）理經力敏捷，有舉一而知三的聰明：（四）可塑性也　小，品性易於改善：（五）自治力及團結力强，易於組織起來：（六）當於創造力，常能自行發見工　上的新方法：（七）具有藝術的才能，曾參加　華戲院演出「小婦人」，頗著成績，（八）最重要的竟都有相當正確的認識，都抱很大的志氣，不金錢，不怕咸脅。這　的時代與環境，才有這樣的孩子，再加好敎育，前途眞是無限呢！</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖三省　組織農業銀團　在中交領導下實施貸款</h3>
<p>銀錢業者各行莊爲調劑農業金融舉　農　貸款後，頃巳籌劉組織蘇浙皖三省農業銀團，由參加各行莊分任農貸資金，並由中央主管部之協助，在中央儲備銀行以及中國交通兩行傾導之下，實施農村貸　，銀團設在上海，並於三省各地設立　事處，依照政府頒佈之（金融機關辦理農村貸　通則」辦理之。聞貸款對象為農民組織之合作社，凡農民因正當需要，均得依法申請貸款，同時規定限度，利率特別低落，並聞各地方政府，對於農業銀團，允酌茲　助其因辦理農貸之　當費。</p>

<p>計畫推進</p>
<p>先後巳有各之種發儲行蓄。獎最券近上海之銀行，曾發起獎動儲蓄迵，結果成績頗佳，市民無不踴躍儲蓄，是證國民對政府獎勵儲蓄之意裴，巳有相當程度之認識。茲悉首都方面中央　備銀行有鑒於此，亦特聯合全市各銀行銀號錢莊等，同時舉辦獎勵儲蓄週、規定自十月十八日至十月三十一日之兩週問內，凡前往該行及各行號裝等，有定期存欵在九百元以上者，均給有較原訂存款　則，特別優厚之利息此外並將採川</p>
<p>搖獎辦法</p>
<p>凡在此兩週內之定期存戶，均有得獎之希望，最多者可得有五百元之多，故此種機會識屬難得，蓋既有較優厚之利息，更有得獎之希望，預料在此兩週內、全市民衆，定機多踴躍存儲，不願失此良也。</p>

<h3>上週滬市各業　益見平穩</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商市况，上　問仍　穩定，焓赤紋銀軍，　鈔均無上落，股票則證券交易所開拍交易期迫，買風　熾，市價趨昻。錢業拆息高為二角，因十月底比　關係，頭寸需要殷切，但中儲及各銀錢　準備庫儘量調劉資金，銀根緊而稍平。工商各業則以商統會統利工作普遍，大宗針織品如襪毛巾手帕及戰毯衛身衫等囤貨。紛紛貶價出籠，皂燭曁火柴三者日用物品終因當局佈告辦理登記，尅期實施計口配給，以致一般經　商人大紀恐慌，乃各競先减個，　圖脫手，截至昨日止，此項物品售價較諸一過前已劇降三分之一弱。至於各業市塲買　亦尙稱平靜。再上海社記者昨續向各業公會探得消息，各該公會鑒於職靑所在，均經先後派員專赴商統會糧食局及麵粉食糖等配給機關，要求准即派配充分原料，以便繼續製貨應市，免得向黑市添購，藉輕成本。而得抑低市價。據悉各該配給機關有者巳允尅期配給，有者允考慮或請示後核奪，故各業所需原料預料在短期內或能充分派給。</p>

<h3>正視友邦印度飢饉</h3>
<p>— 朱雨堂</p>
<p>一，英美的罪亞與偽善</p>
<p>英美兩個的國家罪惡和　善，　今日這樣可受深刻的非難。恐怕是沒有先例的，如渡蘭。法國。荷蘭及其他世界上因信賴英　而滅亡的國家，迄今已有不少。他們都受丁英美　善政策的欺騙。尤其是印度現在的大飢饉，從人　上看，實為可怖的罪惡，所以英美的偽善誠無過及此者。</p>
<p>據倫敦新聞紀事報所載，目下滯留倫敦的印度聯盟秘書長克里修拿。美濃，於十月十二日稱：「在印庇，現今有二千五百萬人乃至三千萬人行將餓死、殼類的價格目前暴　一百五十倍。醫院直為屍首的交換所，這是人類有史以來的大飢荒！」據說舉在加爾各答一地，一日間即有難百饑殍。</p>
<p>芙首相邱吉爾與美　統羅斯福，傲漫地討論如何解決戰時世界食積問題，以及協約國代表濟濟一堂，在談笑風生中舉行可滿足世界全人類要求的糧食會議，已是數月以前的　了、但在其問，英國軍事當局却在印度大事微發糧食，以致引起前述的大飢饉，他們為了自肥，　不惜目覩印度民豪餓死！嘿，這還不是漠視人道人情的殘忍行為嗎？而且在構成英國一部且欲利用之作為英美對日攻勢立足點的印度，更是如此，對於這種冷酷不仁的英美，印度人的心懷反感，　屢對英國作自由獨立的門爭，實在是當然的現象。</p>
<p>且觀意大利，當巴柱　奧元帥降伏時，很有一些意大利人表示贊同。他們想必是受了羅斯福「榮　和平」一詞的欺騙，不然則是惑於羅斯福允諾供給食糧一事的魅力，可　，今日在協約軍佔領下的意大利，似乎正在哭喊食糧不夠，這眞是一咎由自得」。眼前看到在英國桎桔下喘息呻吟的印度，仍會中了英美　善的鬼計，實在可嘆可憐！</p>
<p>常言說得好，盎格魯　克遜人是宣傳的能手，然而曾為英美敵國的意大利。竟如此被他們範絡了。不過、　格魯撒克遜人的罪惡與偽善，非迫於一時之勢出乎一時之心，則巳暸然可察。這原是盎格魯撒克遜人國家（即英　兩國，的本來性格、這在一百數寸年間他們對外國允其是對弱小民族所取的政策上，早巳自然而然流　印來了、並不是現在可以矯　的。恐怕只要英美兩國中的任何一國繼續存在，這種性格便無從取去吧。不，縱令英美兩國全告滅亡，只要有盎格　徹克遜人生存在地球上，它便將永遠存在亦未可知。</p>
<p>印度獨立運動的聖人甘地。關於英國的對印政策，嘗謂一英國在和印度協議以前，應先謝罪。」話雖如此，倘若果眞是偶然或勢不得巳而犯的罪惡　那或的可憑對方的陳謝而釋然，若是出於有生且來的本性的罪惡，那末雖然表示謝罪之意百萬　，也然理由視此為其眞止革心洗面的機悔。</p>
<p>馬來卡拉，朗保爾印度人協會支部長曾稱：「只要印度國民大會派首　者稍具一點常識，便誰　不會一　英國的甜言蜜語。」誠然，盎格魯　克遲的積惡及偽善，今日巳為世界的常識，聞見現在印度地蒙受的慘狀，固無有不醒悟者！</p>
<p>二，英國的三大罪狀</p>
<p>茲　摭英國在大東亞所犯的罪惡如次：</p>
<p>第一，在澳洲所犯者：佔領了澳洲的英國，立即將它作為罪囚的流謫地，自此以後，僅僅在一百二十年間，一百萬澳洲原住民竟减為五萬人，其原因端在英人殘苛的　殺Lynch他們稱之為「土人狩，」公然不分婦女考幼，將當地土著殺得一乾二淨。此識為世界侵略史上　兇惡的犯罪的一例。</p>
<p>第二，是在印度所犯者：在印度，英國也屢犯虐殺七著的罪惡，尤因飛機出現，　時常毫無理由地將印度的部落炸成平地。殺害全體住民。又時　甘言誘騙住民羣集一處一　而將他們全都炸斃。像這樣的例，實在不轉枚　。此外，他們所取的另一種陰險狡猾的手段，就是餓死印度人。印度未被英國佔領以前、是世界右敎的豐　之國。但自從為英國佔領以來。在英人的竭力榨取下—於過去八十年問，已有一千八百萬印度入餓斃丁。英國奪取了即度的食　、印度的金銀財寶。印度的自由。印度的一切。於是印度便成為世界第一個貧窮的國家了。其奸邪狡猾的手段別問世界侵略史的一面！</p>
<p>第三。是在中國所犯者：英國自鴉片戰爭以來，在所謂租借他的美名下，置立榨　中國的根擴飾，開中國殖民地化之端而且鴉片戰爭是以　引中國人盡吸鴉片烟為目的而起的戰學，所以他們企圖使中國人皆成「烏烟鬼」以期慢慢亡國滅種的心事，十分明白。一方而撈錢，一方面又可滅亡他國，這的確是比對付印度的飢　政　更毒辣更陰險的手設！</p>
<p>三·美國的偽善政策</p>
<p>造罪　史的老祖宗是英國，由前述各點巳可明瞭，而限在英國的　下，狂吸甘汁的就是美國。田這極意義　，美國可說比英國　險險。</p>
<p>不　在印度或漢洲。美國都趁英國遭遇困尼的時機，擴大美國商品的銷路。而上海英租界的載過「花　橋」向東仲，也因為美國在人不知鬼不覺的常兒潛入了　界。</p>
<p>原是宣佈基督教的協曾及敎育中國人的學校，不知在何時也　成為養成模仿美人者的機　，　　南　更利　價批模仿者來榨取中國。</p>
<p>一八四四年號稱為中　而締結的協定，其眞正的目的知在　食美國商品的銷路，以及由獎　　人　美而利用　工工資的低　去　造橫　北美大陸的鐵路。因此一待沒有需要時，立即用移民法極度限制巾國人到美國去。最先促進中日關係惡化者，便是美國大總統格　頓，爾後英美即協力阻害中日的提携。一邊口頭高叫人類平等及和平，一邊桃　其他民族，引起他們之間的不和。然後利用此問隙以詞自肥，乃是他們的老手段。在大東亞國內，不，在全世界可說已沒有一個國家不上過英美偽等政策的當而吃了莫大的虧的。</p>
<p>四，民族的覺醒</p>
<p>這次印度的飢　慘默，實為世界特別是大東罪　內民族的最好敎關。英美兩國　在難然　乎完全被逐出大東亞的境域，可，他們尙未捻素再開　侵略的野心他們還企圖用　殺和彈壓來榨取大東亞民放。我們不得再受他們　　政策的欺騙了。</p>
<p>菲律賓和　甸　多年成為英美榨取的對象，現在他們却巳利用大東亞擊戰的良機逮到多年的宿望，宣言光榮的獨立了。然而英美今日狙未能忘　在大東亞吸取甘汁的夢！　看今日印度的慘狀！因為英美是天才的偽華者，他們的政策比羅斯福戰前給美國人的一美國不參加壓爭」的約言更為危險！（吉　。</p>
<h3>珊瑚海閃電戰記　（續十月四日週刊第五號）</h3>
<p>友軍機動部隊</p>
<p>〇時〇分，在有前方見有曳是的白條　道。一啊！那是敵人，預備好！」射手立刻把機槍的子彈入膛。</p>
<p>我用望遠鏡看得很淸楚，那是×刑軍艦，船橋上的人物，淸晰可見。</p>
<p>「是自己人！」</p>
<p>射手們也說着：「什麽！是自己人？」從機搶座上下來。</p>
<p>幾艘軍艦後而拖着長長一條白波，向前並航，原來他們也在索敵進擊中喲，</p>
<p>眼下發，了這勇敢的戰　隊形。胸中更覺得膽大了。</p>
<p>一艦隊快要　　了！那麽，道海戰也馬上就要猛烈地展開了！</p>
<p>〇時〇〇分，素敵機又發報：一敵針路〇〇度，　力三〇節。」</p>
<p>敵人難道巳經知道我們邀擊，在〇〇度改變方針想　走嗎？</p>
<p>陰暗的陣雲，掩覆着海面，視綫不淸，氣候愈加惡劣起來。逐漸把高度减低至〇〇米，飛機被包園在密雲中，視綫完全不濟，雨水淋漓地闖入機內。</p>
<p>時機漸漸地迫近了。可是在預定的海面，什麽也不見，到處是密雲　覆着的海面，偶而有一片隙縫，得以窺淸海而時，大海如磨光的鏡子般。不見一點黑影。</p>
<p>可恨的陣雨。再飛到高成看時，仍無所見。千載一週的敵人，我們竟放逃了嗎？我們漸次魚急起來。在珊瑚海上　留着無一限的怨恨的我們，祇能就此囘去嗎？運夜準備起來的魚雷，竟成泡影嗎？</p>
<p>電報員也絕望了，打電報囘基地：一敵人不見，向　尼特島的〇〇。」啊！終於囘去了，向留在基地的戰伴、怎樣說呢？</p>
<p>就在這時候，在密雲的隙縫中，看見白條數道</p>
<p>天助！這一定是的！尋呀尋的，敵人的艦隊終於在這裏了。在　瑚海上，願一死以擊滅敵艦隊的決戰之秋，終究降臨了。</p>
<p>在前面的是驅逐艦二艘，巡洋艦一艘，如脫韁之馬，疾駛前走。最大的艘似乎是加利福尼亞號戰艦，後面是稍小的二號艦，在那中間的右面，有巡洋艦一，驅逐艦二，及運輸船一，佈成嚴密的運輸陣形，破浪而進。</p>
<p>都不是夢中所見的數糧隊嗎？</p>
<p>時機到了！</p>
<p>指揮官下了突擊的命令。</p>
<p>一預　一切」</p>
<p>射手們各就機　槍座。</p>
<p>我整一下飛行　，把手槍　彈放入飛行服內，身上一切端正　齊了，完成了戰　準備。</p>
<p>我機在指揮官之前，巳經急降開始突擊了。</p>
<p>全體機隊利用密雲掩護，勇猛而果敢地突擊，</p>
<p>「胡！胡！胡！」　力大增，是飛機從高處急降下的聲音。</p>
<p>我機見到目的物，猶如老鷹看見小鷄，　然而下，實施突學，</p>
<p>「轟！轟！飛機急降下的炸音，把耳朶都　　了。機身突破如牛乳般薄灰色的密雲，那時候雲正如我們所盼望的一樣，一層層密佈着。</p>
<p>蒼白的海面上所劉的白色綫條，逐漸擴大起來。</p>
<p>從高空急降下迷〇〇米高度，敵人的防空砲火極為熾烈，向我突襲隊問放。我撥周國火花四散，灰色的彈幕，層層包裏上來。　體激烈震動，海面異常騷亂，機前遮風板上　滿着炸彈落下時推起的水柱，水烟的飛沫，前方後　糊不能見。</p>
<p>在烏黑的炸彈烟慕突出突進，向下突擊，敵艦一　開始迥避。隊形紊亂無序。</p>
<p>海面，因砲彈的炸裂，飛沫四濺。爆炸的聲音，震耳欲聲。現在生死巳置之度外，胸無雜念，心中祇想怎樣一發即擊中　人。</p>
<p>駕駛員　然自若，直心目的物下銜。</p>
<p>全機，着　幕，　敎突擊。</p>
<p>敵艦隊逐漸靠近了。「畜生！」現在不能囘去了。</p>
<p>全體機隊用全速力向數　突擊。　　會加　列了，在　的一　噴出火來了。如紅　般的火花。向　艦隊射學。</p>
<p>「完了！畜生！」右面主要被炸裂彈命中，機　大感震動。</p>
<p>附近有一片火光冲起，向前方左右方張望時：「中了！」「一號艦命中了！一號艦命中了！「二號！二　號艦！」</p>
<p>一號艦　側了。二號前面的飛機，投下了</p>
<p>我機改變方針，改以號二　為目標。照準艦首扭。」入股服的敵　。從兩舷受到熾烈的機關槍火的集中射擊。衝進機槍的彈雨，用全力追避。</p>
<p>！　！　！機關槍的掃射愈加激烈。我機的射手，拚命向敵艦甲板上來往的敵兵掃射。噴出紫莢的　。身手的眼睛，閃　着異樣的光集中於敵艦。</p>
<p>因飛很很接近軍艦，所以那二號艦後桶上的星條旗淸晰可見。啊！那是哭　的軍艦！偵察員在槍彈雨中在拍照。我緊提着「速度加减　」，開着最大的速力，駕駛員則緊握住操從　。</p>
<p>二號　及其他軍　在發地。那是主砲。狼狽不　的敵人，正在　放主砲　！海而上　起極大的水柱。「命中心！　，正的命中了。」</p>
<p>二　艦上　起了二道魚　的炸烟，右而的巡洋艦上　起了一道。的確命中了魚　了。啊！多麽欣　啊！</p>
<p>在那一　問，一切的辛勞都忘記了。一切的季勞都得到了酬報了。</p>
<p>「萬歲！萬歲！」　呼聲中，銜出了敵人的彈　。我　雖被擊中了幾下，但　員一個也沒有受傷。眞是不可思議！</p>
<p>囘首柑　畔，誰也不　曾參加過那樣激戰的締情，平　的面部表情，悠閑地眺望着在沉下去的　一人的　　（完）（翼　）</p>

<h3>雨景</h3>
<p>— 儀宜</p>
<p>鳥雲越聚越多，天沉沉地似乎要壓下來一般，我和弟弟匆匆地走着；但是離開家遝有全程的三分之二；突然天像開了口的水閘，大雨傾盆地倒下，　光一閃，接着是一聲　　。好像就擊在我們的頭項，震得我幾乎跌倒，我們只得站在一處　　下，暫時躱避着，那裏正是南市的最盛區，麟比的茶室，接踵的行人，因茶室而興的押當，商行，點綴成緊　的市面。</p>
<p>從天到地，好像掛着一片瀑布，白茫茫地瀉著，我討厭　雜的四周，我　悔着不該出門，不然，這時坐在窗前，欣賞雨景，是何等的富有詩意；我咕嚕地埋怨着，弟弟笑這：「這裏也不錯啊！悲創喜劇都有，儘你看。」我疑惑地探紫四周：「那來的戲院？」地指點着左面，輕輕地說道：「上台了，快看。」</p>
<p>我　着他的指點看去，一個年約二十歲的靑年，穿了一件香港衫，一條白　子，手裏握着一張當票，反覆地　釋着；這時，對面走來一個穿香雲紗　衫褲的中年人，拍　他的肩問道：「怎麽了朋友？」「全輸了。」「那末想法去撈轉來啊！」「沒本　呀！」靑年頓了頓脚嘆識。</p>
<p>「你手裏是什麽呢。」「一張常票。」</p>
<p>「當的什麽？多少錢？」</p>
<p>「一件豹皮斗蓬，一奔絨綫衫褲，共當了三百五十元。」</p>
<p>「優瓜！為什麼不讀了賣掉？」</p>
<p>「錢呢？連本帶利要四百多才行呀！」</p>
<p>「我借給你，等你　掉了還我，」那人慷慨地拍着口袋說道：</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」靑年　　間着。</p>
<p>「常　眞的。」</p>
<p>他們定　對而一家當舖，十分　後，靑年挾了偶大包、一同出來。進八　　一家商行，一會兒又出來，包仍挾着，靑年搖着頭說：『不責，不賣，　道只　一千元嗎』？</p>
<p>他們又過來，走進我們背後的一家，櫃上的人　看了一會，帶着不須要的神氣號道：「一千元」。</p>
<p>「一千元？」</p>
<p>「你要多少。」　　了一會，靑年說：「二千元」。</p>
<p>「不要，」衣服被輕輕地一推。</p>
<p>「再加些吧！」是中年人在央求。</p>
<p>「一千○廿元再多不要。」</p>
<p>靑年在包衣服，中年人拖住他，「大家商量商量，我錢等着耍用呢！」</p>
<p>他不肯，還要到別家去，中年人的笑臉由不耐變成怒容，脅迫着：「我有事啊！誰有工失等你，牽絲板簾地這樣不漂亮，我和你根本不認戰，幫了你忙。還要不識相。」</p>
<p>靑年沒奈何，只得再和他們論價，中年人做好又做歹，終於一千二百元成交。</p>
<p>錢拿到丁。還給中年人四百六十幾元，額外再給他十元，他勃然這：「這算什麽？利息呢？還是佣　？」</p>
<p>「還要佣鈿？」</p>
<p>「怎樣？我和你曰當義？」靑年忍痛地再加十元。</p>
<p>「小弟弟，眞不　世面，利息就不　他，　　　碼一　，這機十元廿元的　要，」他們堅持了好久。　果中年人得到了五百七十元。</p>
<p>靑年藏好鈔票。　一整衣領，精神煥發地大　步而一家菜室走去，這裏中年人又從商行眞拿到五十元，一個女人向他笑駡道：「很心鬼』他　了一聲，一面定，一面大笑說：「這是見子養老子」</p>
<p>嘩嘩的雨聲、好似配　的音樂、我木然站着，心憤怒得將爆炸，是為靑平不平呢？還是　究社會？“己也分辦不出。中年人又來了。指手　　地告訴商行裏的人：「該死，那個洋盤，又一起輸光了，接速四　小，統統吃掉。」</p>
<p>「哈哈：眞是而死」。「我倒希望他　，贏了，可以開飯票，我又好靠他吃一頓，這個倒每的洋盤。」他惋惜着「　！」三毛！又麻雀去，五十元猜，我去叫金囡和黑炭。」說罷，他走進一條弄內</p>
<p>「唉！湯裏來，水裏去，錢來得容易，化得也容易，」跟了這啞遲的聲音，我回過頭去，是角落　一個老人在慨嘆。</p>
<p>雨仍沒停，我不能再忍耐，「走吧！」我毫不遲疑地跑到雨中，冰冷的雨水，淋到身上，我感到一陣爽快，弟弟　　地說道：「這幕戲前後共演半小時。」</p>
<p>「但是道是喜劇？還是悲劇？」我開他，他默然不答，只有單調的雨聲，充耳　　，似狂笑又　悲號。</p>
<h3>平湖散絃</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>逆旅</p>
<p>琴師捲上了油黃的袖子，三弦拉出勉强的笑聲，一宇字吐出身世之感，沙啞得實在難以聽淸。門縫裏露出半個粉臉。慘淡得以前不曾得見，逆旅的生活已經慣了。也不禁一陣　愴　來。　　百合橋　　今晚又是好月亮，銀光浮在橋頭上，記得曾來過，是去年的中秋夜。凉風吹襲着悽惻的心情，秋蟲的鳴叫似長短的針，記憶是一團暗雲，一片黃葉弄暗了水中的月。</p>
<p>夜街行</p>
<p>石板路我走得特別的後，街燈在夜霧中黯淡，風從西面吹來，我知道秋意已闌珊，土墻上有新貼上的標語，　　裏幼小的蝙蝠在學飛，夜賣聲似在替嬰孩叫魂我心頭感到幾分寒冷。小飯舖的馬槽就在前面夜行人喫着冒氣的熱　飩，平海的夜街行，是如此地令人留戀呀！</p>
<h3>牛子兒的厄運</h3>
<p>— 章祖爕</p>
<p>「牛子兒。牛子兒，該起身啦：」牛子兒在夢　正跟小三子相打得起勁；冷不　的一喊，喚　了他。</p>
<p>揉揉眼。吃了敗仗的小三子早沒了影蹤。牛子兒高興起來、一反身，人就　了床。</p>
<p>「媽，甚麼時候啦？」</p>
<p>「你自己瞧呀……阿陸來約過你了，叫你趕快去！」</p>
<p>一抬頭，門外滿佈着强烈的陽光，絲絲地刺人眼睛。</p>
<p>慌亂地、在　間　上那汚穢的破布袋；拎起掃帶；將雙小糞箕往袋　一塞；奔往炙熱的馬路上。同時，暗暗地咒罵上一聲：「遲了！他媽的小三子，躭擱我的農光！……眞，活見鬼，好端端地，我會跟他打起架來？！」</p>
<p>老遠、送過來媽的可囑，「牛子兒，趕早回來　！等着你生火！」</p>
<p>牛子兒家裏買不起煤球，全　牛子兒去刨點樹皮，或掃點煤屑來煮飯。</p>
<p>昨晚，跟阿陸約點：趁大淸早到華集煤球廠門口去掃煤　，可是，現在他遲了！他躭心趕不上煮飯的老時光，誤了爸爸的上工，怎辦！？</p>
<p>這麽一想，更急了！牛子兒的身影，飛快地向前　額上的汗，涔涔地下個不停；衣袖也跟着一上一下的揮個不止。</p>
<p>流呀揮的，終於奔到了目的地。</p>
<p>好容易在人叢裏尋到了阿陸，阿陸悄悄地告訴他：停會兒有裝煤車子來</p>
<p>「嗚！嗚！」汽苗的突發，使每個人的神經格外緊張。於是，避有兩旁，射出希望的光，地備者「　擊」正像候在暗　的貓兒，　撲　子的一般。</p>
<p>近了！更近！慢了！—終於停住不動！於是</p>
<p>「呼」的一下牛子兒揀了塊大的，抱起來，反身就奔！</p>
<p>「拍！」牛子　着了一鞭，隔着軍　的　衣，使他痛得　熬。差點兒沒將煤塊　了手！一囘頭，一個魁梧的身號，提着鞭，正趕向自已！</p>
<p>牛子兒人小，奔不快；何况地掛着布袋，審着煤屑，掃帚，糞箕，兩手又抱着沉重的煤塊，雖是費了最大的努力，却仍像受創般　　。</p>
<p>牛子兒明白給抓住了該是如何的結事。這樣，更慌了，沒命的　題問　逃！囘頭一看：距離得遠了，更遠了！追來的人放慢脚步了。</p>
<p>「洞！」緊接着—「哇」地一個嬌聲在放聲大哭！</p>
<p>牛子兒昏了！</p>
<p>原來，當他同顧的一剎那。正巧與一位六七歲的小　娃攬了個滿懷，將她碰到在地！</p>
<p>帶領着她的一位洋裝紳士，一伸手，毫不費力的抓住了他！</p>
<p>「拍！拍！」怪輕　的賞了半子兒兩下耳光！</p>
<p>牛子兒發了念！</p>
<p>一隻毛茸茸的手，抓住了牛子兄的衣襟。</p>
<p>「拍！拍！」牛子兒又着了两下沉重的耳光！抱着的煤塊撒了手！根前在　火！天在轉，地在搖！</p>

<h3>第一區市立學校　體育表演盛况　参加学生九六五六人</h3>
<p>本市第一區市立學校為慶祝本屆國慶起見，特於六月十日下午二時，在膠州路公　發行體育表　大會，　者有缘躬逢其盛，參觀後甚覺處。續滿窮，爰將大會中形形色色，摘要記述於後，以餉　者。</p>
<p>共十九校　是日天氣晴朝，新高氣爽，正靑年男女　練體格，努力運動之時。此次參加大會之學校，計有第童男子中學四校，女子中學一校，西　男子中小學一校，女子中小學一校，華童小學七校，半日小學一校，民衆學校四校，共計十九校，學生幾　九千六百五十六人，集第一區全部市立學校及全體男女學生，舉行體　表　大會，尙係　舉。各界來責及學生家長　來參　者，亦有五千人之多，一時膠州路上，　水　計，公　各處，人頭鑽動，誠本屆雙十節有　義之　會也。</p>
<p>開幕典禮　鐘嗚　　，　時奏樂開會，一萬餘人全體肅立，向我儕最　愛之國旋，仃無上之敬禮，俄見靑天白日滿地紅之國徽，隨幽雅之樂聲，徐徐上升，飄揚於我國土之上。使無助靑年學生。對於紀念　慶，保有深刻之印象。升旗後，萬餘人合唱之國歌，響徹雲　尤能邀發全　國民之愛國情緒，旅由大會會長致開會　，及名譽會長訓話，語多勗勉，演　大意已。翌日各報，不一再資述。</p>
<p>國民體操　　式完畢，有各校代表隊一千五百人，表演　民體操，男女選手均衣白翻領襯衫，黃短褲　短　　，跑鞋，則裝整齊，精抖　　國民體操共有十六段，每段動作柔有力，一頗足代表東方體靑之精神一。表演時，由總指揮用「一麥克風」發令，一千五，人之動作不　上下左右均能整齊一致，蔚為壯　一，攝影師　後奔跑一開一麥拉」不　工作，直至全部操練完畢為止。</p>
<p>精彩表演　休息　，　校開始體　表演，節目共有十四項之多，均　鉤心鬥角，別出心　，或寓　於國慶或幷重　體　，為雄壯之體操，或為淸妙之舞蹈，五光十色，美不勝收，各校入塲時，均有校旗為之先導膏　　衆瞭然，表溢時，各校啦啦隊輒報以，烈之歡呼以作精神上之援助。路隊時復　　相這，藉　凱旋之祝意。</p>
<p>各有所長　就各按所表演之　目而論，則各有專長，如兩西意學校之疊羅漢，或係做到功夫，未更殿以中華民國萬歲之歡呼，出於外　子女之口吻，實屬難能可貴。再如格致中學之　　戰，用體操之方式，表　　烏之載術，亦莊亦誥，博得全體觀衆之　呼。他如規規中學之樣興操，演　精神奕奕，第一女中之敏捷舞，服裝與姿能均稱　美，　　山學之國術，與育　中學之船賽　亦各有特長　　。</p>

<h3>本年夏季　女子運動　打球游水十二分起勁</h3>
<p>雖然巳　過去，但是　　這　上海的運動，可算是熱閙。即上海　摩發小姐，短衣赤脚，踏着自行車，來去如飛，成　結隊，打球游水，十二分的起勁，太陽的熱度不能减少她個的興趣、値得我們追　。現將最近方去的夏季中各種女子運動，　舉一二。</p>
<p>籃球　照理籃球不，夏季的運動，但是上海各種迎動，從來不分季的。本李女子籃球並無聯賽，僅為各種男子慈善表演賽中之插曲。球隊有白　，華達，三省等，名將有張，箴黃明緩各位小妞。比　多半在戶外球地舉行。她們打來異常精彩，頗得　衆的好評。戰　上海女子籃球每年在中靑及美童有聯賽，前者句括各種團體女子球隊。後者各學校勁旅，如中西，崇德，啓秀，工女中等，另外海軍靑年會有一聯賽，用男子規則，戰後。每年中靑雖有女子籃球聯麥，但參加者不甚踴　。希望今年冬季至小能有十隊以上參加。</p>
<p>壘球　在上海尙不十分風行，近幾年　西　之提倡。我國人士亦漸注意。每年上海有男子及女子聯賽，本埠女子壘球隊以蓋燈最早，隊員均係中西及聖約　之學生，　手　慕　，遊舉手沈　　，技術均不在外國小姐乏下。其次有約大及工女中學生組成之大學女生隊，實力亦頗雄學，打壘球的必盡條件，是快，穩·狼·三個字。中國小姐比較起來，似乎太斯女了一點，而且門檻不精，這因為我們是半路出家。外國小姐自幼就開始練習。上次外國女子壘球隊與金滬男子階比賽，結果和局，她們赤着變脚　猛張悍與男于無異。希明年體靑當局能發　大規模的男子和女子壘球表演賽‘以引起大衆的興　，由希望各女校能提倡　種球戲比較起來很　　，一根榫一個球　値有限。手套可用幾年。壘球　夏季最　的運動在西方和日本每逢比賽禹人空巷，緊　熱烈不在足球之下。</p>
<p>游泳　上海的上姐多半不喜游泳，她們怕太陽　黑了皮　又怕傳染着皮膚病、去游泳的小姐，也丕過是去拍幾張小照，和男朋友談談心，去誠心練游水的。可以說沒有。也事　也不可能，張圖和虹口游泳池，擁擠不堪，那能讓你五十碼，一頁碼的往來自由，這次上　全市女子游賽，參加者共十六位小如。結果。沈　程句　各項　軍，各人總分第一是沈　明小姐，乃我國　　先　沈　良先生之女公子，她們都是十幾歲的小妹妹將夾前淦無量，希望明　能多有游泳比賽及表演。楊秀瓊所創的全國紀錄，現在已有六七年了，希望　夏有人能打破。</p>
<p>夏季　風行的運動是游泳·壘球·網球·希望體靑當局和熱心體育人士，盡力提倡鼓勵，　希望上海的小姐們在夏日能從　運動，雖然太陽能　黑你們的皮膚，但是健美的好克力姑娘是新時代男性最歡迎的對象。希望上海的先生們在夏日多請你們的女友　姐妹們去游水和打球。若然和她們到空氣法濁人口糟雜的戲院或舞塲，　是最不聰明而又不絕濟的舉動。（李名　）</p>
<h3>乒乓界少活動　大家應急起直追</h3>

<h3>Educating and Caring for Street Urchins</h3>
<p>The Municipal Citizen Welfare Association held its winter member assembly the other day, discussing several proposed motions. Among them was a suggestion regarding improving traffic, which we pointed out in yesterday's short commentary as being in urgent need of improvement, to serve the convenience of travelers. Regarding railway traffic, if the China Railway Company's strength is insufficient to fully rectify it, then the municipal authorities and relevant agencies must cooperate to resolve it, and not turn a blind eye and cause travelers immense suffering.</p>
<p>Secondly, another suggestion from the association was to "convene with charitable organizations to raise funds to shelter and aid street urchins," resolving to establish a "Street Urchin Education and Care Committee" specifically responsible for this task. We have always advocated that the relief, education, and care of street urchins should be viewed as a relatively proactive social welfare undertaking, handled through collective effort. On Children's Day, April 4th of this year, we specifically pointed out in our editorial that sheltering, educating, and caring for street urchins is an extremely urgent task, hoping that various child welfare and care charitable organizations would jointly shoulder this responsibility. We called upon all sectors of society to contribute money to help achieve this significant undertaking of cultivating the nation. We hoped that there would no longer be poor children wandering the streets by next Children's Day. Furthermore, on June 30th, we raised the issue of sheltering, educating, and caring for street urchins again in our editorial, hoping that relevant parties would pay attention and promptly plan for sheltering and education, to preserve more vitality for the country and eliminate some crises for society.</p>
<p>Why do we place particular emphasis on the education and care of street urchins? Because children are the lifeblood of the nation, and the future fortune of the nation depends on how children are educated and cared for today. Street urchins have the same intelligence and wisdom as children from ordinary families, but they lead wandering lives due to the oppression of poverty and homelessness. Who doesn't have children? Who doesn't have a heart to protect their children? We should slightly shift our affection for our own children to care for street urchins. The fragile minds of children are all pure and innocent, completely governed by their environment. One becomes red near vermilion and black near ink. Are child beggars and petty thieves born with lowly bones? Children are originally without fault; it is societal ills that promote them.</p>
<p>We are all members of society. Therefore, we should regard innocent street urchins, children who have lost their parents' education and care, as everyone's children, and everyone has a responsibility to educate and care for them. People cannot survive by separating themselves from society. For any social undertaking that benefits the public, every member of society must contribute their utmost enthusiasm and perseverance to cooperate, ensuring the smooth progress of social welfare undertakings. Moreover, educating and caring for street urchins is an especially proactive social welfare undertaking.</p>
<p>Now that the Citizen Welfare Association has put forward a proposal and organized a specialized committee to discuss and proceed, in addition to sincerely hoping that the association actively promotes it, we offer a few humble suggestions for reference:</p>
<p>The association is a non-governmental organization, and its nature is mainly to advocate and demand welfare undertakings related to all citizens, not to bear the actual responsibility for charitable relief. However, the matter of educating and caring for street urchins is not passive charitable relief but embodies the proactive cultivation of national vitality, as mentioned earlier. In addition to designing and initiating work, the association should also bear the actual responsibility for sheltering and educating, and preside over the handling, while consulting relevant government agencies to provide full assistance.</p>
<p>When undertaking social undertakings, thorough consideration must be given beforehand to decide on a plan, but when implementing it, it should be done swiftly, quickly achieving results, and practicing what is preached. Assuming a goal of two million yuan for funding and six months as the first phase, with a designated number of people to be sheltered, once the plan is properly arranged, implementation should begin immediately. If the first phase is successful, continue with the second phase, and it will not be difficult to shelter everyone. However, the education and care area should preferably be chosen in a rural area where prices are lower and customs are simple and honest, and gradually move to it after sheltering to implement education and care.</p>
<p>In terms of nurturing, maintain the minimum level of nutrition and warm clothing. In terms of education, strictly implement knowledge and physical training. At the same time, to cope with the difficult financial situation and gradually achieve self-sufficiency, in addition to providing education and care, the organization should also run simple production businesses. Designate suitable-aged students to engage in production work for part of their time, both producing for the organization and enriching their own skills, laying the foundation for future employment and serving society.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister's Two Years in Power: Established a Decisive Battle System and Laid the Foundation for Victory in the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The 18th marks the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, successive Japanese cabinets have strived to adjust the relationship between national affairs and command, but it was only under the Tojo Cabinet that a complete resolution was achieved. Since Prime Minister Tojo concurrently assumed the position of Minister of the Army, political and military strategies have been aligned. The current cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister, who oversees all measures and devotes his full effort to warfare. When strategic locations were not yet secured after the start of the war, the Prime Minister devoted all his energy to warfare, so domestic affairs could not be fully taken care of. After the initial stages of the Greater East Asia War, great victories were achieved, and strategic locations for certain victory were established, the Prime Minister began to devote his efforts to resolving domestic issues. After three reorganizations, the Tojo Cabinet has gradually become a decisive battle cabinet. The past situation of the Tojo Cabinet is introduced as follows:</p>
<p>The Cabinet Was Reorganized Three Times</p>
<p>The Tojo Cabinet can be divided into three periods. In the first period, Prime Minister Tojo prepared for the Japan-America war after responding to the final notification issued by the United States on November 26th of Showa 10 (Republic of China 30) in the Diet. After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Yuzawa, the Vice-Minister of Home Affairs, was appointed as Minister, Foreign Minister Togo resigned, Director-General of the Information Bureau Tani was appointed Foreign Minister, and former Minister of Finance Aoki was appointed Minister of Greater East Asia. This can be called the first reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet. During this first reorganization period, the Tojo Cabinet proposed establishing the Support Council and implementing the recommendation system for House of Representatives elections, creating the Political Association, and implementing staff reductions within the government to establish the Greater East Asia Ministry to promote domestic affairs and adapt to the second stage of the war. The first cabinet reorganization cannot be called a fundamental reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet.</p>
<p>Actively Innovating Domestic Affairs</p>
<p>Later, to adapt to various situations, there was a second reorganization. Prime Minister Tojo convened the ordinary Diet session last spring, and after careful consideration after the closing, he implemented a cabinet of national unity on April 20th of this year. Ambassador to China Shigemitsu was appointed Foreign Minister, Political Affairs Research Council Chairman of the Greater Political Association Kozaki was appointed Minister of Home Affairs, and Deputy Director-General of the Support Council and State Minister Kunihiro Hashida was appointed Minister of Education. The second reorganization of the Tojo Cabinet was thus completed, and the government, the Political Association, and the Support Council became a trinity, corresponding in name and reality in the cabinet's center and manifesting its true form. Since the beginning of this year, the war in the North and South Pacific has become more intense. At this time, the Tojo Cabinet held the 82nd Extraordinary Diet session in mid-June, proposing to strengthen enterprises and increase war power, and to promptly promote and enhance strategic measures. At the same time, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech in the Diet, clarifying the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and aiding independence, and visited Thailand in July of this year, and inspected the Indian National Army in Shonan, which had already led to the successive independence of Burma and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Leveraging National Power</p>
<p>Since then, the Greater East Asia War has entered the stage of air force decisive battle, so mass production of aircraft is an urgent priority. At the same time, after the Batireo regime in Europe abandoned faith and betrayed its allies, the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy became more united. To achieve the war's objectives, they fully leveraged their national power. To cope with the current and future war situation, the Tojo Cabinet convened a cabinet meeting on September 20th, passing the outline for the current national policy operation network, the Ministry of Communications, etc. At the same time, war-time measures were promptly and thoroughly promoted in the economic, cultural, and social aspects. In the midst of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo's government affairs are extremely busy, but his political health is also excellent. Now, on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, the one hundred million citizens, in addition to appealing for trust in the government, are united under the leadership of Prime Minister Tojo, fighting together to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in North China Inflicts Heavy Damage on Communist Army, Critical Blow to CCP's Economy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – A front-line dispatch from the Japanese Army in North China on the 17th states that since the launch of the autumn offensive by the Japanese Army in North China, the Communist Army in North China has been in a state of disintegration, fleeing towards the mountainous area in the northern part of the Taihang Mountains, and is currently wandering on the brink of starvation. Subsequently, the Japanese Army units moving south used skillful tactics of enticement, inflicting heavy damage on them in various places. The Communist 22nd Regiment launched an attack on a certain county in Ji Province on the 15th, but was defeated by an attack from an elite Japanese unit. In this battle, the Communist Chief of Staff was killed and officers were captured. The battle situation and results in that area on the 15th are recorded as follows: (A) After the Japanese Army discovered about 300 men from the Communist 22nd Regiment near a certain village southwest of Mazhuang, they immediately surrounded and attacked them. After a fierce battle, the Communist Army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. In this battle, the Japanese Army seized the following war spoils: a total of 86 Communist bodies, 31 prisoners, one light machine gun, one grenade launcher, 23 rifles, 536 rifle bullets, 9 mortar shells, 3 pistols, 2,560 pistol bullets, 82 hand grenades, and many other military horses. (B) Another Japanese unit discovered more than 100 Communist soldiers on a high ground southwest of Mianzhen at dawn on the 14th and immediately attacked them. In addition to the enemy soldiers killed and captured, they seized eight rifles, 480 rifle bullets, 50 hand grenades, and countless other ammunition.</p>
<h3>Grain Procurement and Sales Office to Close at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>17th (Central News Agency) – The Grain Procurement and Sales General Office of the Ministry of Food was responsible for the affairs handled by the Food Management Committee of the Executive Yuan, and was responsible for the unified purchase and distribution of grain. Because the National Government strengthened the grain control mechanism and highly leveraged the autonomy of merchants, it ordered the National General Chamber of Commerce to establish a Grain Control Committee in July of this year to continue handling the above work. Since Director Yuan Ludeng has been actively preparing, everything is now ready, and all work will begin in the coming days. Therefore, the office has already been completely handled to close, and all business will be closed by the 20th of this month, and all outstanding matters must be handled clearly before the end of this month in order to close down.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Java Senate, Address by the Japanese Military Commander, Expecting Everyone to Fulfill Their Responsibilities and Carry Out Their Mission</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Java Central Senate is a governmental auxiliary body organized by the people. The Senate held its first meeting at 10:30 this morning. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, the leaders of the military administration, the governors of the various provinces, representatives of the Navy, representatives of the Japanese, and native Indonesian councilors of the various military administration departments attended. After the ceremony, Director-General Utada of the Secretariat reported the process of establishment to the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, conveyed the order to open the Senate to the senators, and then the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, Harada, gave a speech. The general idea was that the purpose of organizing the Central Senate was not only to make the people thoroughly understand the intentions of the Japanese military authorities and penetrate their military administration, but also to allow public opinion to be communicated upwards so that the military administration could be promoted smoothly in an orderly manner. Since the formation of the Volunteer Army, the Japanese side has been very expectant of its results. However, it is regrettable that although the Senate can be said to have taken the first glorious step, everyone should know that there are still many difficulties ahead, and it is deeply hoped that everyone will do their utmost to fulfill their responsibilities and work together to respond to the expectations of the people and promote the smooth progress of the military administration. Finally, Senator Utejo read out the declaration on behalf of the senators, and the morning agenda was completed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo Sends Congratulations</p>
<p>Jakarta, 17th (Central News Agency) – When the first Java Central Senate held its opening ceremony on the 17th, Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of the Army, and Supreme Commander of the Southern Army Terauchi sent congratulatory telegrams. The text of the telegrams is as follows: On the occasion of the opening of the first Central Senate, in addition to expressing my heartfelt congratulations, I also pray for its sound development in the future, and I hope that the Central Senate will carry out its mission to the end and achieve the practical effect of communicating the upper intentions and lower sentiments, and become the driving force for gathering the total power of the officials and the people.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Implements Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency) – The county government of this county is implementing the registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the urban area. Aside from the Anhui Provincial Special Investigation Committee, in addition to County Magistrate Hu concurrently serving as the chairman, the members on the Chinese side have generally been decided.

<h3>Battles Intensify in Lower Reaches of Dnieper River, Soviet Offensive Makes Little Progress</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency: The fighting on the Eastern Front has become more intense again since the day before yesterday, especially in the central and southern sectors. The Soviet army spared no effort to use a large amount of manpower and materials to attack the weaker German forces in various sectors. The Soviet army also imitated French tactics, attacking east of Orel, first bombarding with various military weapons for an hour, and then attacking this position, which was only four kilometers wide, with six divisions, but the result was still being repelled by the German defenders. The Soviet advance northwest of Tunicov was also contained. There was no change in the Gomel battle situation. There were only local battles in the Leningrad area. There were no battles in the Chaipler Lane area. Only aircraft activity was observed, and it was seen that the enemy's concentrated forces were very large. Northwest of Dnipropetrovsk, an enemy attack had been expected for a long time. The enemy launched an offensive at dawn the day before yesterday, but there has been no progress so far, and the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<h3>German Forces Defend New Positions on North Bank of Volkhov River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: On the 14th, British and American forces launched a large-scale offensive against the German positions in the Voltuno area and the surrounding mountains, paying a heavy price, so that General Clark's American Fifth Army had to reorganize its forces. On the western wing of the front line, General Clark's infantry and tank divisions, although possessing very superior heavy artillery, were still unable to penetrate the German lines or make any progress to the north. The German army's elastic defense tactics once again proved their effectiveness. Although the enemy's landing force north of the mouth of the Voltuno River was reinforced with 50 tanks, it ultimately failed to break through the German positions there. Only in the east and west areas of Capua did the German grenadier soldiers, after several hours of fierce fighting, had to retreat to the highlands east of the Voltuno Plain. The enemy either attacked head-on or encircled from the flanks, attempting to seize the new German positions, but the enemy's attempt was met with a powerful and successful German counter-attack, forcing the enemy to retreat to its original position. Along the important highway leading from Campobasso through the Apennine Mountains to Rome, the enemy had concentrated powerful infantry and tank units, and the British-Canadian army group from Campobasso was providing support. The German forces fighting in the area, fearing the enemy's power and the threat of artillery fire, detonated all the important facilities along the highway and then retreated into the mountains, thus blocking several sections of the highway. The British and American forces cautiously advanced along the broken highway, encountering powerful shelling from the German artillery units. At the same time, under the protection of accurate German fire, the German forces withdrew from Vinchiaturo without being disturbed by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Air Force Officers' Symposium Concludes</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) – The 7th was the second day. At 9:00 a.m., the meeting continued in the Aviation Administration Auditorium, first holding a group review meeting. All proposals were divided into four groups for review. The first group was for management bidding, responsible by Chen Yousheng, Sheng Jianmo, and Chen Ziwen. The second group was for equipment, responsible by Zeng Zhaode and Lu Minji. The third group was for military education, responsible by Zhang Qin, Zhang Shaoshi, Xu Shengquan, and Liang Wenhua. The fourth group was for propaganda, responsible by Ge Shiping, Zhang Chaoren, and Zhou Daming. After the group review was completed, the meeting continued. First, Chairman Yao Xijiu proposed each item for voting based on the opinions of each group, and classified them into (most important), (secondary), and (deferred) according to actual needs. The Aviation Administration then prepared a plan and submitted it to the Military Affairs Commission for selection and implementation. The conference then ended satisfactorily on that day.</p>
<h3>Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Approaching, US to Propose Post-War Policy Plan</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources: Moscow officially announced for the first time on Saturday that British Foreign Secretary Eden, US Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov would be holding a meeting soon. "Izvestia" commented that all decisions regarding post-war issues in the tripartite conference must be secondary to the issue of the Second Front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency, well-informed sources in Washington stated yesterday that the plan for the Allied post-war policy that US Secretary of State Hull will propose at the Moscow Conference will be approved by the Senate before the opening of the conference. The result of Senate approval can, on the one hand, strategically overcome the isolationist faction led by Kandelou, and on the other hand, strengthen Hull's position at the Moscow Conference. According to US political circles: If the Allied forces achieve victory in Italy as soon as possible, Hull's position will be further elevated. Roosevelt fully intends to cause surprise at the Moscow Conference with the news of the occupation of Rome, to convince Soviet politicians who underestimate the value of the Italian war.</p>
<h3>Swedish Parliament to Hold Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to what was learned yesterday: The two houses of the Swedish Parliament will hold a secret meeting on Monday, and a public meeting will be held on October 20th to discuss domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<h3>President Shen of Jiangsu High Court Takes Office</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) – Xia Jinglu, President of the Jiangsu High Court, has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to be transferred to serve as the President of the Suhuai Special Zone High Court, and to concurrently serve as the President of the Shanshan County (Xuzhou) District Court. The vacancy has been filled by Shen Wenjie by order of the Ministry. After receiving the order, Shen took office on the 10th. Shen is said to be from Wujiang and has served as a judge and presiding judge in courts in various places before the Incident. Most recently, he served as the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court and a Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>US Air Squadrons Attack German Mainland, 400 Destroyed in Seven Days</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency: When the US Air Force bombed Schweinfurt in western Germany a few days ago, it dispatched more than 300 aircraft, but lost most of them. According to military experts, the number of aircraft lost by the US Air Force while bombing various German cities in the period from October 8th to 14th reached about 400. For example, when the US Air Force bombed Bremen on October 8th, it lost 48 bombers; when it bombed the northern coast of Germany on the 10th, it lost 62 bombers; and when it bombed Munster, it lost 51. When bombing Schweinfurt, at least 150 bombers were lost, so the total is 311. This figure is only for those that were actually shot down. If the number of those that were damaged and crashed on the way back, as well as the number of those missing, is included, then it has exceeded 400, so the number of pilots lost should be more than 4,000.</p>
<h3>Lisbon Completes Air Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of the Army announced in the afternoon that the air defense facilities of Lisbon, Porto, and Coimbra have been completed. The public will have the opportunity to inspect these defense facilities during the exercises at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Two British Ships Transferred to Portugal</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Two British gunboats sailed into Lisbon Harbor on Friday and were transferred to the Portuguese Navy the next day. The Portuguese Minister of the Navy sent an officer as a representative to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Reiterates Territorial Demands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Transocean News Agency carries a London dispatch: The Yugoslav government-in-exile has now made demands regarding Trieste, Istria, and the Province of Gorizia, which were assigned to Italy by the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. A new Yugoslav minister said in a speech in Cairo that recognizing Italy's position as a co-belligerent cannot negate Yugoslavia's demands against Italy. The injustice created by the Treaty of Rapallo should now be rectified. He also stated that he had notified the anti-Axis governments with a memorandum, and that the demands regarding this matter had received sympathetic acceptance. He also criticized Sforza, who was responsible for the annexation of this territory.</p>

<h3>Grain Control Committee Strengthens Organization, Establishes Regional Offices, Heads and Deputies Already Determined</h3>

<h3>Non-Controlled Goods Allowed Free Movement: Second Police Bureau Orders Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Post-war commodity prices have skyrocketed, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are extremely precarious. To regulate prices and suppress hoarding, the central government has implemented controls on essential daily food items to stabilize prices. All controlled goods are naturally prohibited from being freely transported. However, it has been found that non-controlled goods are often also prohibited from being transported, which is seriously affecting the development of commerce. Therefore, to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses, the Shanghai Special Municipality Government yesterday strictly ordered the First, Second, and Third Police Bureaus to instruct their subordinate police officers that all non-controlled goods should be allowed to be freely transported by the people, and no deliberate obstruction should be allowed. After receiving the order, the Second Police Bureau immediately instructed its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus that non-controlled goods should be facilitated for passage and should not be deliberately obstructed in order to comply with official decrees and stabilize commerce.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Bridge Iron Gates Now Open All Night</h3>
<p>Regarding the full-night opening of the Nanyang Bridge iron gates, which was originally scheduled to be implemented on the Double Tenth Festival, it was temporarily postponed due to the emergency preparedness measures in the seventh and eighth districts. It was implemented starting from the 12th of this month, and has now been open all night for three days. The authorities are currently carefully considering the widespread opening of other iron gates.</p>
<h3>Coal Retailers Request Improved Coal Rationing, Thorough Investigation of Black Market to Stabilize Coal Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, in order to stabilize coal market conditions, believes that it is necessary to improve rationing and thoroughly investigate coal merchants engaged in the black market. They issued a statement saying: "The Da Zhong Coal Company sent a letter stating that the temporary rationing of domestic coal for civilian use would begin on October 1st. This news has spread, causing widespread panic. Everyone believes that although the rationing of domestic A-grade coal is extremely limited, it is still a source of income for retailers. If it is stopped, retailers will be severely threatened, and employees will suffer from unemployment. Therefore, a meeting of representatives of food staff was convened to discuss countermeasures at length."</p>
<p>Rationing Situation</p>
<p>"The coal allocated to us by the Da Zhong Coal Company, in addition to the 5% profit deducted by Da Zhong Lian, also requires a 5% commission to be deducted by fellow merchants, totaling 30% of the coal, which is used for private buying and selling. At that time, although we were subjected to heavy deductions and exploitation, each household could still receive more than ten tons of A-grade coal per month, and there was also non-controlled coal (existing coal reserves) that could be sold. We could barely maintain our livelihoods under the 10% profit stipulated by the authorities. However, as the cost of living increased day by day, the amount of coal allocated decreased day by day, and our lives became more and more difficult."</p>
<p>Coal for Civilian Use</p>
<p>"Soon, the authorities had allocations for coal for factory use and coal for civilian use. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company issued us a form, instructing us to fill in the factories and civilian customers we had been serving. However, they took our forms, collected the coal from the authorities, and distributed it themselves. At that time, except for a small portion of coal for civilian use (restaurants, laundry businesses), the rest was taken away. Until June of this year, we continued to negotiate, and as a result, they agreed to transfer all coal for civilian use to us for supply starting from the autumn, and the 30% deduction from household coal would also be canceled."</p>
<p>Sudden Suspension of Supply</p>
<p>"Who knew that it would still be the same? The amount of domestic coal was reduced even further. Each household only received about one ton of A-grade coal per month, and some received only a few baskets. When we were in a difficult situation, just as we were about to request assistance from the authorities, Da Zhong Lian Coal suddenly sent a letter suspending the allocation, which left us at a loss. They did not tell us the reason or the duration of the suspension. Therefore, we had no choice but to petition the authorities to improve the allocation mechanism."</p>
<p>Improve Rationing</p>
<p>"We propose and request the authorities to divide coal into four grades, A, B, C, and D, and to eliminate the distinction between fellow merchants and retailers. Because the two are essentially the same, to avoid a small number of people manipulating the situation, we hope that coal will be allocated directly to retailers, without commissions being added along the way, to reduce the burden. In the future, in addition to allocating domestic coal to each member for sales, the rest will be centrally distributed by the association to ensure consistent policies and avoid numerous malpractices. We mutually pledge not to engage in the black market and will cooperate with the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation. We also request the authorities to review the coal reserves to prevent manipulation and monopoly."</p>

<h3>A Stage Play Worth Recommending: "Gone with the Wind"</h3>
<p>The four main characters in the story of "Gone with the Wind" have tasted the flavors of life - birth, love, marriage, and death, four great basic life experiences.</p>
<p>"Gone with the Wind" was adapted for the screen and caused a sensation among movie fans all over the world. Today, it is performed on the stage of "Paris" Theater, and this drama, performed with great effort, will undoubtedly cause a sensation among theater fans in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The person who adapted "Gone with the Wind" this time is Zhu Fan, and the director is Wu Renzhi. The content of the script of "Gone with the Wind" has been adapted into a friendly "Chinese Flavor". It tells the bloody history of the Northern Expedition, which corresponds to the era of around 1926, in the beautiful Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>The entire play has a total of four acts, six scenes and five sets, with nearly thirty actors appearing.</p>
<p>The first act is in the Wei family's garden. Wei Xichun is getting married, and relatives and friends are gathering. At the same time, the engagement between Wei Xili and Han Meilan will be announced. Hao Sijia is dressed up to attend the banquet, determined to take Xili away.</p>
<p>Shi Hui's Wei Xili is naturally a successful member, while Lan Lan's Hao Sijia and Mo Chou's Han Meilan also perfectly express the different personalities of the two women, one strong and one gentle.</p>
<p>Wang Jun's Han Chali is obsessed with Sijia. He wants to exchange his heroic posture for Sijia's love, but Sijia only hopes for Xili.</p>
<p>Hao Ren's Bai Ruide also appears here. His appearance is very similar to Clark Gable, with good demeanor and style. He is a new actor from the north.</p>
<p>The second act is that Sijia, for the sake of spite, after Xili's marriage, also married Chali, Meilan's younger brother. Inadvertently, it caused a tragedy of the most wrong kind. On the night of the wedding, Sijia refused to sleep with Chali and let Xili go, asking him to say "love." But Xili insisted on leaving, the atmosphere was very tense. After Xili left, the new groom Chali was ecstatic in the bridal chamber. Wang Jun played it lightly. Aunt San (played by Lin Su) kept saying that she forgot the Ruyi oil, which was also humorous and lovely.</p>
<p>Chali died in the line of duty in less than three days after his marriage. Sijia became a new widow, and Xili fled at night. At the moment of parting, Shi Hui, Lan Lan, and Mo Chou were reluctant to leave, which was very touching.</p>
<p>The third act is that Meilan is in labor. Sijia, because she promised Xili's request, helps Meilan. Ruide comes to tease. The whole play is full of the atmosphere of war, and the effect is realistic. Lan Lan. Mo Chou's acting skills have developed evenly.</p>
<p>The fourth act is that Sijia has fallen into Ruide's arms, and Xili has traveled thousands of miles to unfold a complicated tragic scene. Meilan dies, and Sijia finally realizes that only people with similar personalities can be happy if they marry. The person she loves should be Ruide, not Xili, but Xili has already begun a long journey with no return date. - Here, Lan Lan, Mo Chou, Shi Hui, and Hao Ren have a lot to gain.</p>
<p>There are also actors who have not been mentioned, such as: Ri Wen, Shi Yuan, Shen Min, Zhuang Yan, Chen Ping, Ma Xiaoxiao, Shangguan Yunzhu, etc., who are also very diligent in their performances and deserve praise.</p>
<p>"Gone with the Wind" is a stage play worth recommending. It brings the audience back with a heavy mood - hunger, jealousy, love and hate, and the life emotions intertwined with joy and sorrow. (Zha Min)</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Refugee Children's Education and Shelter: Youyou Education Institute</h3>
<p>Development in Hardship</p>
<p>Shanghai Youyou Education Institute, since its establishment on the memorable August 1st, has begun its planned education and shelter work for refugee children. At that time, the environment in Shanghai, in the midst of a turbulent country, was like a paradise. Compared to other places, prices were relatively stable, and the living expenses for 300 suffering orphans (3 yuan per person per day) were not too difficult. Therefore, the education and shelter business could proceed smoothly. Unfortunately, the Education Institute did not have a fixed fund, and some necessary equipment could not be purchased. Everything was still improvised. For the sake of future development, it was necessary to seek sufficient funding. Therefore, in the winter of 1940, the first fundraising campaign was held, with a target of 50,000 yuan. However, as a result, due to the trust of the public in the Institute's supporters and in view of the importance of the refugee children's education and shelter business. Exceeded the pre-set target and obtained more than 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the equipment inside the institute was improved, and steam boilers and other equipment were purchased, so that both education and shelter were improved. At that time, the number of refugees was just 300, 264 boys and 36 girls, the youngest being 7 years old and the oldest being 17 years old. (In the special state of 1941, the food problem became increasingly serious due to the difficulty of foreign rice supply and the increase in consumption in the city. The Shanghai Beach People's Relief Association also announced the cessation of its food subsidy to the Institute. Under this wave, the Institute decided to disperse part of the refugees. At that time, the children's panic can be seen in their own reports:</p>
<p>"Poverty and hunger swept across Shanghai like a storm. In the face of such unprecedented coercion, the funds accumulated by the Youyou Education Institute were also decreasing day by day. Therefore, it was planned to send one-third of the children back home to allow the remaining students to survive for a few more days."</p>
<p>"The news of the dispersal spread, and the entire Institute seemed to be covered with a layer of gloomy shadow. The children's hearts are fragile! They put away the red glow on their faces, and the past laughter and quarrels disappeared. In the corner of the third-grade classroom, four or five children who seemed inseparable were quietly sitting together and crying! Listen, isn't there a low whisper in each classroom? "I heard that dozens of people are going to be sent away!" "I'm going to starve to death, I'm going to starve to death!" "Where will they send me?" On the floor in the corridor, several children looked up at the sky, their eyes wide open, as if with endless terror and desire."</p>
<p>Fortunately, after the Institute and the Child Protection Section of the Public Works Department investigated the family situation, only a small portion of those who had homes to return to were sent away. At the same time, the Institute launched a second fundraising campaign, with a target of 150,000 yuan. As a result, it exceeded the target again and received more than 300,000 yuan, which shows how concerned society is about the education and shelter of refugee children. However, at that time, prices in Shanghai had already begun to rise continuously, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the education and shelter of refugee children. In the winter of 1942, the third fundraising campaign was launched, with a target of 300,000 yuan. As a result, 400,000 to 500,000 yuan was obtained, but the economic situation became increasingly difficult due to soaring prices, and the food problem was particularly serious. Therefore, in the spring of this year, it was jointly decided to send a portion of the refugee children to the countryside. After careful discussion and investigation in the surrounding villages, the Xugong Bridge area of Anting, Kunshan was finally selected. The branch of the Youyou Education Institute was opened on the original site of the Rural Improvement Association, which was previously organized by the Chinese Vocational Education Society. On February 8, the fourth day of the first lunar month, 100 children carried their own clothes and "transplanted" to the Xugong Bridge branch.</p>
<p>Hardships and difficulties did not make them discouraged and disappointed, but instead made their business have new developments. The latest education</p>
<p>The Latest Education</p>
<p>For the suffering children, Youyou Education Institute does not just give some change and leftover food like to beggars. They sincerely give the children the opportunity to receive the latest education. The whole hospital constitutes a complete primary school, with six grades in total, divided into three stages: low, medium, and high. There is one education director and four grade teachers (grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 are formal). In addition, there are subject teachers. The curriculum follows general regulations. Production and practical subjects are taught to middle and high grades to teach them skills for making a living. The characteristics of teaching are:</p>
<p>(1) Regularly implement various civic training, especially love of cleanliness, orderliness, politeness, diligence in writing, and willingness to serve as the five major training goals, and continue to revise teaching materials and competition methods, and regularly train and encourage.</p>
<p>(2) Expand the children's autonomous organization, establish the "Youyou Children's Corps," and elect outstanding children from each grade as representatives. There is a corps headquarters office, and each unit or group hires teachers as instructors. All activities and services are planned and led by the corps.</p>
<p>(3) Advocate extracurricular activities. During extracurricular time, open classrooms for each grade for reading, writing, games, chess, chanting, drama, and other activities. There are also table tennis, basketball, volleyball, and other sports facilities, and a competition is held for one activity each week.</p>
<p>(4) Implement labor service methods, organize cleaning, catering, laundry, barber, sewing, medical and other labor service teams, which are subordinate to the labor division of the Youyou Children's Corps. All middle and high-grade students must voluntarily participate in a team according to their interests and abilities.</p>
<p>(5) In order to focus and strengthen the guidance of autonomous activities, extracurricular activities, and labor services, a children's activity guidance committee is organized, consisting of five representatives elected by the rescue staff. There is an activity calendar, and various activities are promoted in a planned way.</p>
<p>Lower-grade children attend classes for six hours a day, while middle and high-grade children attend classes for half a day and work for half a day. The achievements of the curriculum are comparable to those of excellent primary schools outside, so they can directly enter higher education after graduation. In 1941, 24 students graduated. In addition to employment, 7 passed the Suzhou Middle School examination, and 6 refugee children were transformed into middle school students. This year, 7 students graduated from the Shanghai General Hospital, including 2 girls who were admitted to Nanyang Girls' Middle School and 3 boys who were admitted to Xiaguang Middle School. These children also obtained scholarships from Shen Bao or Xinwen Bao, but the cost of food and lodging is still borne by Youyou Education.</p>
<p>In the process of teaching, they have developed many unique features of refugee children: (1) A serious attitude towards learning, never letting a problem go unresolved; (2) A strong sense of feeling and memory; (3) Agile reasoning ability, with the intelligence to understand three things from one example; (4) High plasticity, and personality is easy to improve; (5) Strong autonomy and unity, easy to organize; (6) Creative talent, often able to independently discover new methods in work; (7) Artistic talent, having participated in the performance of "Little Women" at the Shanghai Grand Theater, with considerable success; (8) Most importantly, they all have a fairly correct understanding, and they all have great ambitions, not worshiping money and not fearing threats. Only in this era and environment can there be such children. With good education, the future is truly unlimited!</p>

<h3>Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Organize Agricultural Banking Syndicate to Implement Loans Under Chinese Leadership</h3>
<p>After banks and money shops in various industries adjusted agricultural finance and initiated agricultural loans, they are now preparing to organize an agricultural banking syndicate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The participating banks and money shops will be responsible for the agricultural loan funds, and with the assistance of the central competent department, rural loans will be implemented under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank and the China Communications Bank. The syndicate will be established in Shanghai and will set up offices in various places in the three provinces to handle matters in accordance with the "General Rules for Financial Institutions to Handle Rural Loans" promulgated by the government. It is reported that the target of the loans is cooperative societies organized by farmers. All farmers who have legitimate needs can apply for loans in accordance with the law. At the same time, limits are stipulated, interest rates are particularly low, and it is also reported that local governments are willing to assist the agricultural banking syndicate in the expenses incurred in handling agricultural loans.</p>
<h3>Beijing Money Industry Holds Savings Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - At the second plenary meeting of the National Economic Commission held at the beginning of this year, it was unanimously agreed that during the period of participation in the Greater East Asia War, in order to raise the awareness of national savings to serve the country, the relevant authorities should actively plan and promote after rewarding national savings.</p>
<p>Planning and Promotion</p>
<p>Various types of savings banks have issued savings bonds one after another. Most recently, banks in Shanghai initiated a savings campaign, and the results were quite good. Citizens enthusiastically saved money, which proves that the people have a considerable degree of understanding of the government's intention to encourage savings. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank in the capital, in view of this, has also jointly organized a Savings Week with banks, money shops, and money houses in the city. It is stipulated that during the two weeks from October 18th to October 31st, all those who make fixed deposits of more than 900 yuan at the bank and various banks and shops will be given a special preferential interest rate that is higher than the original deposit rate. In addition, the</p>
<p>Lottery Method Will Be Adopted</p>
<p>All fixed depositors during these two weeks have the hope of winning a prize, with a maximum of 500 yuan. Therefore, this kind of opportunity is rare. Since there is a more preferential interest rate and there is also the hope of winning a prize, it is expected that during these two weeks, all the people in the city will be willing to save money enthusiastically and do not want to miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Seventh District Consumer Cooperative Approved for Establishment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Seventh District People's Consumer Cooperative, initiated by business people in the Seventh District, was approved for establishment by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on October 15th. The preparatory office of the cooperative held the first preparatory meeting at No. 230 Wenmiao Road to discuss various important matters such as soliciting members and surveying the location of the cooperative. As for the first batch of supplies of the cooperative, it is heard that it has been decided to start with daily necessities such as miscellaneous grains, salt, food, and oil. Each share of the cooperative is 20 yuan. All people in the Seventh District of the city can be added as members with the introduction of two or more people.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Conditions Generally Stable Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable last week. The price of pure silver and military notes did not fluctuate, and the stock market was active due to the approaching trading period of the Securities Exchange, pushing up prices. The interest rate for money shops was as high as 20%, due to the urgent need for funds at the end of October. However, the Central Reserve Bank and the reserve warehouses of various banks and money shops adjusted funds as much as possible, and the money market was tight but slightly stable. In terms of industry and commerce, with the widespread promotion of unified profit work by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, large quantities of knitted goods such as socks, towels, handkerchiefs, and blankets, as well as sweaters, were devalued and released onto the market. Daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches were registered and quota rationing was implemented due to the authorities' announcements, causing general panic among merchants. They all competed to reduce prices in an attempt to get rid of their holdings. As of yesterday, the prices of these items had fallen by nearly one-third compared to the past. The market for various industries was also relatively calm. Furthermore, reporters from the Shanghai News Agency continued to inquire from the trade associations yesterday and learned that, in view of their responsibilities, the associations had sent personnel to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Bureau, and the rationing agencies for flour, sugar, etc., requesting that they be allowed to allocate sufficient raw materials immediately so that they could continue to manufacture goods for the market and avoid purchasing from the black market, thereby reducing costs and lowering market prices. It is understood that some of the rationing agencies have agreed to allocate materials according to a fixed schedule, while others have agreed to consider or seek instructions before approving the allocation. Therefore, it is expected that the raw materials needed by various industries may be fully allocated in the short term.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds and Treasury Certificates Can Be Used as Substitutes for Deposit Reserves</h3>
<p>It is learned that the public bonds and treasury certificates issued by the United Bank of Savings' Reserve Committee to its basic members, in order to adjust the financial conditions of the industry, have been approved by the Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank to be used as substitutes for deposit reserves. At the same time, these public bonds and treasury certificates can be used to borrow cash from the United Bank of Savings with a face value of 100%.</p>
<h3>Walnut and Dried Longan: Difficult to Rebound</h3>
<p>Walnuts: This year's production is quite abundant, but large ones are especially rare. Therefore, the selected Tianjin walnuts in the new catalog are expensive this time, and the asking price is rising. Old and refrigerated goods are also becoming tight, and the market seems to lack hope for easing.</p>
<p>Dried Longan: Recently, due to the difficulty in sourcing and the dwindling inventory, purchasing prices have frequently increased. Moreover, new goods are not easily transported in the short term, which is the biggest reason why it's difficult to rebound. It is heard that merchants are mainly holding firm, but the market price is too high, which is also not advisable. Once the selling order is over, there may be a possibility of a turnaround. Those holding goods should seize the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Facing the Famine in Allied India</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yutang</p>
<p>I. The Crimes and Hypocrisy of Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The crimes and hypocrisy of Britain and the United States are so worthy of profound condemnation today that there is perhaps no precedent for it. Countries such as Poland, France, Holland, and others in the world that perished because they trusted Britain have been numerous to date. They were all deceived by the hypocritical policies of Britain and the United States. In particular, the current great famine in India is, from a humanitarian perspective, a horrifying crime. Therefore, the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States is truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>According to the London News Chronicle, Krishna Menon, Secretary-General of the Indian League, currently staying in London, stated on October 12th: "In India, 25 million to 30 million people are about to starve to death. The price of grains has skyrocketed 150 times. Hospitals are direct exchange places for corpses. This is the greatest famine in human history!" It is said that in Calcutta alone, hundreds of people starve to death every day.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt arrogantly discussed how to solve the wartime world food problem, and representatives of the Allies gathered together and held a food conference that could satisfy the world's entire population amidst laughter and banter. It was several months ago, but in the meantime, the British military authorities have massively requisitioned food in India, causing the aforementioned great famine. In order to enrich themselves, they do not hesitate to watch the Indian people starve to death! Hey, isn't this a cruel act of disregarding humanity and human feelings? Moreover, this is happening in India, which constitutes a part of Britain and which Britain wants to use as a foothold for the Anglo-American offensive against Japan. It is only natural that the Indian people harbor resentment towards this cold and unkind Britain and the United States and have repeatedly fought for freedom and independence from Britain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider Italy. When Marshal Badoglio surrendered, some Italians expressed their approval. They must have been deceived by Roosevelt's term "glorious peace," or else they were bewitched by Roosevelt's promise to supply food. However, it seems that Italy, under Allied occupation today, is crying out that there is not enough food. This is truly "deserved." It is lamentable and pitiful that India, gasping and groaning under British shackles, still falls for the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, Anglo-Saxons are masters of propaganda. However, Italy, which was once an enemy of Britain and the United States, was so ensnared by them. However, the crimes and hypocrisy of the Anglo-Saxons, unless forced by temporary circumstances or arising from a temporary impulse, are clearly discernible. This is the inherent nature of Anglo-Saxon countries (i.e., Britain and the United States). This has naturally flowed out in their policies towards foreign countries, especially towards weak nations, for over a hundred years and cannot be corrected now. I fear that as long as any one of the two countries, Britain and the United States, continues to exist, this character will be impossible to remove. No, even if Britain and the United States were to perish completely, as long as Anglo-Saxons exist on Earth, it may exist forever.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, the saint of the Indian independence movement, once said regarding Britain's policy towards India, "Britain should apologize before negotiating with India." However, if it is truly a crime committed accidentally or out of necessity, it may be possible to be relieved by the other party's apology. But if it is a crime stemming from inherent nature, then even if a million apologies are expressed, there is no reason to regard this as a sincere opportunity for reform and repentance.</p>
<p>Malacca Lara, the branch leader of the All-India Association, once said, "As long as the leaders dispatched by the Indian National Congress have a little common sense, they will never believe a word of British sweet talk." Indeed, the long-standing evils and hypocrisy of the Anglo-Saxons are now common knowledge in the world. Upon hearing and seeing the current miserable state of India, there is no one who does not wake up!</p>
<p>II. Britain's Three Major Crimes</p>
<p>Here are some of the crimes committed by Britain in the Greater East Asia region:</p>
<p>First, the crimes committed in Australia: After occupying Australia, Britain immediately used it as a penal colony. Since then, in just 120 years, the one million Aboriginal Australians have been reduced to 50,000. The reason lies in the cruel killings by the British (Lynch). They called it "Aboriginal Hunting," openly killing the local aborigines, regardless of women and children. This is the most heinous example of crime in the history of world aggression.</p>
<p>Second, the crimes committed in India: In India, Britain has repeatedly committed the crime of torturing and killing the people. Especially after the advent of airplanes, they often bombed Indian tribes into flat ground for no reason, killing all the residents. They also sometimes lured residents into gathering in one place and then bombing them all to death. Examples like this are too numerous to count. In addition, another insidious and cunning method they have adopted is to starve the Indian people to death. India was a country rich in agriculture before it was occupied by Britain. But since being occupied by Britain, under the strenuous exploitation by the British, 18 million Indians have starved to death in the past 80 years. Britain has taken India's food, India's gold and silver treasures, India's freedom, and everything India has. As a result, India has become the first poor country in the world. Its treacherous and cunning methods are a shame on the history of world aggression!</p>
<p>Third, the crimes committed in China: Since the Opium War, Britain has established bases for exploiting China under the guise of so-called concessions, initiating the colonization of China. Moreover, the Opium War was a war launched with the aim of inducing the Chinese people to smoke opium in order to slowly destroy the country and exterminate the race. It is very clear that they intended to turn the Chinese people into "opium ghosts" in order to gradually destroy the country and exterminate the race. On the one hand, they made money, and on the other hand, they destroyed other countries. This is indeed a more vicious and insidious tactic than the starvation policy against India!</p>
<p>III. The Hypocritical Policy of the United States</p>
<p>Britain is the ancestor of creating historical crimes, which can be clearly understood from the aforementioned points, and it is the United States that is now greedily sucking the sweet juice under Britain's shadow. In this sense, the United States can be said to be more insidious than Britain.</p>
<p>Whether in India or China, the United States has taken advantage of Britain's difficulties to expand the sales of American goods. The "Huayuan Bridge" in the British Concession in Shanghai has also gradually been infiltrated by the United States without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>The churches and schools that originally proclaimed Christianity and educated the Chinese have unknowingly become institutions for cultivating imitators of Americans, and they have even used these imitators to exploit China at low prices.</p>
<p>The treaty concluded in 1844, which was touted as a treaty of friendship between China and the United States, was actually intended to open up sales channels for American goods and to use cheap Chinese labor lured to the United States to build railways across the North American continent. Therefore, as soon as there was no need for it, they immediately used immigration laws to severely restrict Chinese people from going to the United States. The first person to promote the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations was US President Grant, and then Britain and the United States jointly obstructed Sino-Japanese cooperation. On the one hand, they shouted loudly about human equality and peace, and on the other hand, they provoked other nations, causing discord among them. Then, they used these gaps to enrich themselves, which is their old trick. In the Greater East Asia region, no, it can be said that there is not a single country in the world that has not been fooled by the hypocritical policies of Britain and the United States and suffered great losses.</p>
<p>IV. National Awakening</p>
<p>This famine in India is truly the best lesson for the nations of the world, especially those within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although Britain and the United States have been almost completely expelled from the Greater East Asia region, they have not yet given up their ambition to launch aggression again. They still attempt to exploit the Greater East Asia nations through killing and suppression. We must no longer be deceived by their hypocritical policies.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Burma, which have been objects of exploitation by Britain and the United States for many years, have now taken advantage of the Greater East Asia War to achieve their long-cherished desire and declare glorious independence. However, Britain and the United States still cannot forget their dream of sucking sweet juice in Greater East Asia! Look at the tragic situation in India today! Because Britain and the United States are geniuses of hypocrisy, their policies are more dangerous than Roosevelt's pre-war promise to the American people that "America will not participate in the war!" (Ji Yan.)</p>
<h3>Record of the Lightning War in the Coral Sea (Continued from No. 5 of the Weekly on October 4th)</h3>
<p>Allied Mobile Forces</p>
<p>00:00, a white trail of smoke was spotted ahead. "Ah! That's the enemy, get ready!" The gunner immediately loaded the machine gun.</p>
<p>I could see clearly with binoculars. It was an enemy warship. The figures on the bridge were clearly visible.</p>
<p>"It's one of our own!"</p>
<p>The gunners also said, "What! One of our own?" They got down from the machine gun seats.</p>
<p>Several warships were towing long white waves behind them, sailing forward side by side. It turned out that they were also searching for the enemy in a coordinated attack.</p>
<p>Seeing this brave battle formation, I felt even bolder.</p>
<p>The fleet is about to collide! Then, a fierce naval battle is about to unfold!</p>
<p>00:00, the scout plane reported again: "Enemy heading 00 degrees, speed 30 knots."</p>
<p>Did the enemy already know we were intercepting them and changed direction at 00 degrees to escape?</p>
<p>Dark clouds covered the sea surface, visibility was poor, and the weather was getting worse. We gradually reduced our altitude to 00 meters. The plane was surrounded by dense clouds, and visibility was completely blocked. Rain poured into the plane.</p>
<p>The moment was gradually approaching. But on the scheduled sea, nothing was seen. Everywhere was the sea covered by dense clouds. Occasionally, there was a gap, allowing us to see the sea briefly. The sea was like a polished mirror. Not a single dark shadow was visible.</p>
<p>Damn the rain showers. We flew higher to see again, but still nothing was seen. Were we going to let the enemy, who only comes once in a lifetime, escape? Were we gradually getting impatient? On the Coral Sea, could we only go back with unlimited resentment? Was the torpedo we prepared for the whole night going to be just a bubble?</p>
<p>The telegraph operator was also desperate and telegraphed back to base: "Enemy not found, heading for... Nete Island 00." Ah! Finally going back. How would we tell our comrades left behind at the base?</p>
<p>Just then, we saw several white streaks in the gap of the dense clouds.</p>
<p>Heaven help us! This must be them! After searching and searching, the enemy fleet was finally here. In the Coral Sea, the time for a decisive battle to destroy the enemy fleet, which we were willing to die for, had finally arrived.</p>
<p>In front were two destroyers and one cruiser, rushing forward like horses freed from their reins. The largest ship seemed to be the battleship California, followed by a slightly smaller second ship. In the middle of them on the right were one cruiser, two destroyers, and one transport ship, forming a tight transport formation, forging through the waves.</p>
<p>Wasn't this the unit of ships we had dreamed of seeing?</p>
<p>The time had come!</p>
<p>The commander gave the order to attack.</p>
<p>"Prepare everything!"</p>
<p>The gunners took their machine gun seats.</p>
<p>I adjusted the flight instruments, put the bullets for the pistol into my flight suit, and made sure everything was tidy and ready for battle.</p>
<p>My plane started the attack before the commander's.</p>
<p>The entire squadron took advantage of the cloud cover to attack bravely and decisively.</p>
<p>"Woo! Woo! Woo!" The power increased greatly as the plane dove steeply from a high altitude.</p>
<p>My plane saw its target, like an eagle seeing a chick, swooped down to execute the attack.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom!" The sound of the plane diving steeply deafened my ears. The fuselage broke through the thin, milky gray clouds. At that time, the clouds were densely layered, just as we had hoped.</p>
<p>The white lines on the pale sea surface gradually expanded.</p>
<p>We dove steeply from a high altitude to an altitude of 00 meters. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, firing at our attack squadron. Sparks flew in all directions around me, and a gray barrage of bullets enveloped us. The fuselage shook violently, the sea became extremely turbulent, and the windshield in front of the plane was covered with water columns thrown up by the bombs falling. The splashes of water vapor blurred the front and rear.</p>
<p>We pushed through the dark smoke screen of the bombs and continued to dive, while the enemy ships began to evade, their formation disorganized.</p>
<p>The sea was filled with splashes from the exploding shells. The sound of explosions was deafening. Now, we had put life and death aside. Our minds were free of distractions, and all we thought about was how to hit the enemy with one shot.</p>
<p>The pilot was calm and focused on the target.</p>
<p>The whole plane, under the cover of the smoke, carried out a fierce attack.</p>
<p>The enemy fleet was getting closer. "Damn it!" There was no turning back now.</p>
<p>The entire squadron attacked the enemy ships at full speed. The intensity of the gunfire increased, and flames burst from the guns. Like red flowers, they fired at the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>"It's over! Damn it!" The main part of the right side was hit by an exploding shell, and the fuselage shook violently.</p>
<p>A flash of light rose nearby. When I looked to the front, left, and right, I saw: "Hit! The number one ship is hit! The number one ship is hit! Number two! Number two ship!"</p>
<p>The number one ship was listing. The plane in front of the number two ship dropped its torpedoes.</p>
<p>My plane changed direction and aimed at number two ship. "Aim at the bow of the ship." The enemy soldiers rushed about. We received concentrated machine gun fire from both sides of the ship. We did our best to dodge the rain of bullets.</p>
<p>! ! ! The machine gun fire became more intense. The gunner of my plane desperately sprayed the enemy soldiers on the deck of the enemy ship. The shells ejected were purple. The eyes of the gunner were gleaming strangely as they focused on the enemy ship.</p>
<p>Because the plane was very close to the warship, the Stars and Stripes on the stern of that number two ship were clearly visible. Ah! That's the hateful enemy warship! The scout was taking pictures in the rain of bullets. I tightened my grip on the "speed control lever," opened up to maximum speed, and the pilot gripped the control stick tightly.</p>
<p>Number two ship and other warships were firing. That was the main gun. The flustered enemy was firing the main guns! Huge columns of water rose on the sea. "Hit! It's a direct hit!"</p>
<p>Two streams of torpedo explosion smoke rose on number two ship, and one rose on the cruiser to the right. We had definitely hit with our torpedoes. Ah! How gratifying!</p>
<p>At that moment, all the hardships were forgotten. All the efforts were rewarded.</p>
<p>"Hurray! Hurray!" Amid the cheers, we broke out of the enemy's barrage of fire. Although my plane was hit several times, none of the crew members were injured. It was truly incredible!</p>
<p>Looking back at the battle site, no one could believe that they had participated in such a fierce battle. With calm expressions on their faces, they leisurely gazed at the sinking enemy ships. (End) (Wing Fire)</p>

<h3>Rain Scene</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>More and more dark clouds gathered, and the sky seemed to press down as if it were about to fall. My younger brother and I were walking hurriedly; but we were still two-thirds of the way from home. Suddenly, the sky opened its floodgates, and heavy rain poured down. A flash of lightning followed by a loud thunderclap. It seemed to strike above our heads, shaking me almost to the point of falling. We had no choice but to stand under an eave to take temporary shelter. It was the most prosperous area of ​​Nanshi, with rows of teahouses and a continuous stream of pedestrians. The pawnshops and businesses that thrived because of the teahouses formed a tightly packed cityscape.</p>
<p>From heaven to earth, it was like a waterfall hanging down, pouring down in a white expanse. I hated the noisy surroundings, and I regretted not staying home. Otherwise, how poetic it would be to sit by the window and admire the rain scene! I grumbled to myself. My younger brother laughed, "It's not bad here either! There are tragedies and comedies to watch." I looked around, puzzled. "Where's the theater?" He pointed to the left and said softly, "It's on stage. Take a look."</p>
<p>I followed his gaze and saw a young man, about twenty years old, wearing a Hong Kong shirt and white pants, holding a pawn ticket in his hand, repeatedly explaining something. At this moment, a middle-aged man in a silk shirt and pants walked over and patted him on the shoulder, asking, "What's wrong, friend?" "I lost everything." "Then find a way to win it back!" "I don't have any capital!" The young man stomped his foot and sighed.</p>
<p>"What do you have in your hand?" "A pawn ticket."</p>
<p>"What did you pawn? How much money?"</p>
<p>"A leopard-print cape and a woolen shirt and pants. I got a total of three hundred and fifty yuan."</p>
<p>"Oh! Why didn't you sell it outright?"</p>
<p>"Where's the money? It'll take more than four hundred yuan including interest!"</p>
<p>"I'll lend it to you. You can pay me back when you sell it," the man said generously, patting his pocket.</p>
<p>"Really?" the young man asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Of course, really."</p>
<p>They decided to go to a pawnshop across the street. After a while, the young man came out with a large package. They entered a business firm. After a while, they came out again. The package was still in his arms. The young man shook his head and said, "It's not worth it. I'm not selling it. They only offer one thousand yuan?"</p>
<p>They came over again and walked into a shop behind us. The person at the counter looked at it for a while and said with an unnecessary air, "One thousand yuan."</p>
<p>"One thousand yuan?"</p>
<p>"How much do you want?" After a while, the young man said, "Two thousand yuan."</p>
<p>"No," the clothes were gently pushed away.</p>
<p>"Add some more!" the middle-aged man pleaded.</p>
<p>"One thousand and twenty yuan. No more."</p>
<p>The young man was wrapping up the clothes. The middle-aged man stopped him. "Everyone, let's discuss this. I need the money right away!"</p>
<p>He refused and wanted to go to another shop. The middle-aged man's smiling face turned into an angry one. He threatened, "I have something to do! Who has time to wait for you? You're being so difficult. I don't even know you, and I helped you. You're being ungrateful."</p>
<p>The young man had no choice but to discuss the price with them again. The middle-aged man sweet-talked and coerced. Finally, they agreed on a price of one thousand and two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>He got the money. He returned four hundred and sixty-odd yuan to the middle-aged man and gave him ten yuan more. He raged, "What is this? What about the interest? Or the commission?"</p>
<p>"You want a commission too?"</p>
<p>"What? Am I doing charity?" The young man painfully added another ten yuan.</p>
<p>"Little brother, you're really inexperienced. You don't even ask for the interest, and you give away ten or twenty yuan like this," they insisted for a long time. Finally, the middle-aged man got five hundred and seventy yuan.</p>
<p>The young man hid the banknotes. He straightened his collar, perked up and walked a step towards a teahouse. Here the middle-aged man retrieved fifty yuan from the shop. A woman smiled and scolded him "very cunning". He cursed and laughed as he said, "This is saving money for raising my son."</p>
<p>The sound of the rain was like a piece of musical accompaniment. I stood there blankly, and my heart was so angry that it was about to explode. Was it because of the unfairness to the young man? Or because of the injustices of society? I couldn't tell. The middle-aged man came again. He gesticulated and told the people in the shop: "Damn, that sucker lost everything again. Connect the four streets soon and eat him all up."</p>
<p>"Haha: It's really stupid". "I wish he won it. If he wins, he can issue me food tickets, and I can eat a meal off him. This stupid sucker." He cried, "Ah!" Sanmao! Back to mahjong, fifty yuan. I'll go call Jin Nv and Black Tan." Having said that, he entered a narrow lane.</p>
<p>"Alas! Going in the soup and coming out of the water, money comes easily, and it goes easily too," followed this hoarse voice. I turned around, and it was an old man in the corner lamenting.</p>
<p>The rain still hadn't stopped. I couldn't stand it anymore. "Let's go!" I ran into the rain without hesitation. The cold rainwater poured over me, and I felt a burst of refreshment. My younger brother said leisurely, "This play lasted a total of half an hour."</p>
<p>"But is it a comedy? Or a tragedy?" I asked him. He remained silent, and only the monotonous sound of rain filled my ears, like wild laughter and wailing.</p>
<h3>Random Strings in Pinghu</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Reverse Journey</p>
<p>The zither player rolled up his oily yellow sleeves. The three-stringed zither produced a forced smile. The words spoken told of a sense of life experience, so hoarse that it was really difficult to hear clearly. Half a powdered face was exposed through the crack in the door. It was so pale that it had never been seen before. I was already used to the life of the reverse journey. I could not help but feel a burst of sadness.</p>
<p>Hundred-Lily Bridge</p>
<p>Tonight is another beautiful moon. The silver light floats on the head of the bridge. I remember having been here before. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. A cool breeze strikes the desolate mood. The chirping of autumn insects is like long and short needles. Memory is a dark cloud. A yellow leaf darkens the moon in the water.</p>
<p>Night Street Walk</p>
<p>I walked particularly slowly on the stone slab road. The street lamps were dim in the night fog. The wind was blowing from the west. I knew that autumn was waning. There were newly posted slogans on the earthen walls. The young bats in the eaves were learning to fly. The night vendors' calls seemed to be calling the souls of infants. I felt a little cold in my heart. The trough of the small restaurant was just in front of me. Night travelers were eating steaming hot wontons. Walking the night streets of Pinghai was so nostalgic!</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of Niu Zi'er</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zuxie</p>
<p>"Niu Zi'er. Niu Zi'er, time to get up!" Niu Zi'er was in a dream, right in the middle of fighting Xiaosanzi; suddenly, a shout woke him.</p>
<p>Rubbing his eyes. The defeated Xiaosanzi had long disappeared. Niu Zi'er was happy and rolled out of bed.</p>
<p>"Mom, what time is it?"</p>
<p>"Look for yourself... A-Lu came to call you, told you to hurry!"</p>
<p>Raising his head, the outside was filled with strong sunlight, piercing his eyes.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, he put on the filthy rag bag in the room; picked up the broom; stuffed the two small dung baskets into the bag; and ran towards the scorching road. At the same time, he secretly cursed: "I'm late! Damn Xiaosanzi, delaying my work! ... Really, what a ghost, why did I have to fight with him?!"</p>
<p>From afar, came his mother's repeated instructions, "Niu Zi'er, come back early! I'm waiting for you to start the fire!"</p>
<p>Niu Zi'er's family couldn't afford coal briquettes, so it all depended on Niu Zi'er to dig up some bark or sweep up some coal dust to cook.</p>
<p>Last night, he made an appointment with A-Lu: to go to the entrance of the Huaji Coal Briquette Factory early in the morning to sweep up coal cinders, but now he was late! He was worried about missing the time to cook, delaying his father's work, what to do!?</p>
<p>Thinking like this, he became even more anxious! Niu Zi'er's figure flew forward, the sweat on his forehead dripped incessantly; his sleeves also swung up and down non-stop.</p>
<p>Flowing and waving, he finally ran to his destination.</p>
<p>He finally found A-Lu in the crowd, and A-Lu quietly told him: there would be coal trucks coming soon.</p>
<p>"Woo! Woo!" The sudden burst of steam made everyone's nerves especially tense. So, they avoided to both sides, shooting out rays of hope, preparing to "attack," just like a cat waiting in the dark, pouncing on a mouse.</p>
<p>Closer! Even closer! Slower!—Finally, it stopped! So,</p>
<p>"Whoosh!" Niu Zi'er picked up a large piece, hugged it, and ran back!</p>
<p>"Snap!" Niu Zi'er received a whip, through the worn military coat, it made him hurt. He almost dropped the coal! Turning his head, a burly figure, holding a whip, was chasing after him!</p>
<p>Niu Zi'er was small, couldn't run fast; moreover, he was burdened with a cloth bag, carrying coal cinders, a broom, and dung baskets, and his hands were holding a heavy piece of coal, even though he made the greatest effort, he still seemed to be injured, staggering.</p>
<p>Niu Zi'er understood what the result would be if he was caught. So, he panicked even more, desperately running away! Looking back: the distance was getting farther, even farther! The person chasing slowed down.</p>
<p>"Thud!" Immediately after—"Wah!" a delicate voice burst into loud crying!</p>
<p>Niu Zi'er fainted!</p>
<p>It turned out that at the moment he looked back, he had accidentally bumped into a six or seven-year-old little girl, knocking her to the ground!</p>
<p>A gentleman in Western dress, leading her, reached out and effortlessly grabbed him!</p>
<p>"Slap! Slap!" He lightly rewarded Niu Zi'er with two slaps!</p>
<p>Niu Zi'er was stunned!</p>
<p>A hairy hand grabbed Niu Zi'er's collar.</p>
<p>"Slap! Slap!" Niu Zi'er received two more heavy slaps! The coal fell from his hands! Fire was in front of him! The sky was spinning, the ground was shaking!</p>

<h3>The First District Municipal Schools' Grand Sports Performance, Participating Students Numbered 9,656</h3>
<p>This city's First District municipal schools, in order to celebrate this year's National Day, held a grand sports performance meeting at the Jiaozhou Road Park on the afternoon of June 10th at 2 pm. This reporter was fortunate enough to attend and felt deeply moved after watching. I will now summarize the various aspects of the meeting below, to share with readers.</p>
<p>A Total of Nineteen Schools On that day, the weather was sunny and clear, the air was fresh and invigorating, a perfect time for young men and women to exercise and strive for physical fitness. The schools participating in this meeting included four boys' middle schools, one girls' middle school, one Western boys' primary and secondary school, one Western girls' primary and secondary school, seven Chinese children's primary schools, one half-day primary school, and four public schools, totaling nineteen schools. There were nearly nine thousand six hundred and fifty-six students, gathering all municipal schools and all male and female students in the First District to hold a sports performance meeting, which was a first. There were also more than five thousand guests and parents of students attending. For a time, Jiaozhou Road was packed like sardines, and everywhere in the park was crowded with people. It was truly a meaningful meeting for this year's Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony As the bell rang, music was played to begin the meeting. More than ten thousand people stood solemnly and paid the highest respect to our most beloved national flag. Then, the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth slowly rose with the elegant music, fluttering over our country. This gave the young students a deep impression of the commemorative celebration. After the flag raising, the national anthem sung by more than ten thousand people resonated through the clouds, especially evoking the patriotic sentiments of the entire nation. Then, the president of the meeting gave an opening speech, and the honorary president gave instructions, with many words of encouragement. The gist of the speeches has already been reported by various newspapers the next day.</p>
<p>National Gymnastics After the ceremony was completed, a representative team of 1,500 people from various schools performed national gymnastics. Male and female athletes were all dressed in white turn-down collar shirts, yellow shorts or short skirts, and running shoes, neatly dressed and full of energy. The national gymnastics consisted of sixteen sections, and each movement was both soft and powerful, representing the spirit of Eastern physical education. During the performance, the general commander issued commands using a "microphone," and the actions of the 1,500 people were neatly and uniformly coordinated, both up and down, left and right, forming a magnificent sight. Photographers ran back and forth, constantly operating their cameras until all the exercises were completed.</p>
<p>Wonderful Performances After a break, the schools began their sports performances. There were fourteen programs in total, all ingeniously designed with originality, either embodying National Day themes or emphasizing physical education. There were majestic gymnastics and graceful dances, colorful and beautiful. When each school entered the arena, they were led by their school flag, making it clear to the audience. During the performances, each school's cheerleading team would give enthusiastic cheers as spiritual support. During the march-past, they congratulated each other, expressing their joy of victory.</p>
<p>Each Had Its Own Strengths Judging from the programs performed, each had its own strengths. For example, the human pyramid performed by the two Western schools was well-executed, and the cheers of "Long live the Republic of China" from the foreign students were truly commendable. Another example was the "Battle" performed by Gezhi Middle School, which used gymnastics to represent the art of warfare, both serious and humorous, winning the applause of the entire audience. Other noteworthy performances included the exercises by Gui Gui Middle School, which showed high spirits, the agility dance by the First Girls' Middle School, with beautiful costumes and graceful postures, the Chinese martial arts by Qishan Middle School, and the boat race by Yucai Middle School, each with its own special features.</p>
<p>The primary schools also had many wonderful performances, such as the marching song by Changde Road Primary School, with neat formation and marching; the rescue demonstration by Jingzhou Road Primary School, which was pure and perfect; and the Red Indian dance by Xinglong Road Primary School, imitating the dance of the Red Indians very realistically. Other performances included the human pyramid by Daxilu Primary School, the sack race by Jimen Road Primary School, the high jump by Taiping Road Primary School, and the wading by Zhaozha Road Primary School, each with its own merits.</p>
<p>Awards Were Given After the Performances Awards were distributed. Many leaders from all walks of life donated prizes to this meeting, totaling more than twenty items. Therefore, each school participating in the performance received one or two prizes, as permanent souvenirs. The students were all overjoyed. Finally, the entire audience enthusiastically cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" three times. As the sun set, our glorious national flag slowly descended amidst the music. (Wende)</p>
<h3>Women's Sports This Summer: Playing Ball and Swimming with Great Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Although the summer has passed, the sports scene in Shanghai can be considered lively. Even Shanghai's modern ladies, in short clothes and bare feet, ride bicycles like the wind, form teams, play ball and swim with great enthusiasm. The heat of the sun cannot diminish their interest, which is worthy of our pursuit. Now, I will briefly mention a few of the various women's sports that have recently ended this summer.</p>
<p>Basketball In theory, basketball is not a summer sport, but various sports in Shanghai have never been seasonal. There is no league for women's basketball in Shanghai. It is only an interlude in various men's charity exhibition games. The teams include Bai E, Huada, and Three Provinces, and famous players include Zhang, Zhen, and Huang Minghuan. The games are mostly held on outdoor courts. They play very wonderfully and are well received by the audience. As for the war, there are leagues for Shanghai women's basketball every year in Zhongqing and American Children, the former including various women's teams, the latter various strong school teams, such as Zhongxi, Chongde, Qixiu, and Industrial Girls' High School. In addition, there is a league for the Navy Youth Association, using men's rules. After the war, although Zhongqing has a women's basketball league every year, the participants are not very enthusiastic. It is hoped that at least ten teams or more will participate this winter.</p>
<p>Softball Softball is not very popular in Shanghai yet. In recent years, with the promotion of Zhongxi, Chinese people have also gradually paid attention. There are men's and women's leagues in Shanghai every year. The earliest women's softball team in this port was Gedi, whose players were all students from Zhongxi and St. John's. The pitchers were admired, and the skills of You Jushou and Shen Jiexian were no less than those of foreign girls. Secondly, there is the University Girls' Team composed of students from Jiaoda and Industrial Girls' High School, which is also quite strong. The necessary conditions for playing softball are speed, stability, and ruthlessness. Compared with Chinese girls, they seem to be too gentle, and their threshold is not precise. This is because we are half-way novices. Foreign girls have been practicing since childhood. Last time, a foreign women's softball team competed with the Jin Hu men's team, and the result was a tie. They were barefoot and fierce, no different from men. It is hoped that the Sports Youth authorities can develop large-scale men's and women's softball exhibition games next year to arouse public interest. I also hope that each girls' school can promote this kind of ball game, which is very cheap compared to others. A mallet and a ball are of limited value. Softball is the most popular sport in summer. In the West and Japan, every game is very crowded, and the enthusiasm is no less than that of football.</p>
<p>Swimming Most of the young ladies in Shanghai do not like swimming. They are afraid that the sun will darken their skin and that they will catch skin diseases. The young ladies who go swimming are just taking a few photos and chatting with their boyfriends. It can be said that no one goes to swim wholeheartedly. It is also impossible. Zhangyuan and Hongkou Swimming Pool are very crowded. How can you swim freely for fifty yards or one hundred yards? This time, in the Shanghai Women's Swimming Competition, there were sixteen participants. As a result, Shen Jianming and Cheng Jielian won various championships. The first place in the overall score was Miss Shen Jianming, who is the daughter of Mr. Shen Jianliang, a pioneer in our country. They are all little girls in their teens. I hope there will be more swimming competitions and performances next year. The national record set by Yang Xiuqiong has been six or seven years ago. I hope someone can break it this summer.</p>
<p>The most popular sports in summer are swimming, softball, and tennis. I hope that the Sports Youth authorities and enthusiastic sports people will do their best to promote and encourage them. I also hope that the young ladies in Shanghai can participate in sports in the summer. Although the sun can darken your skin, a healthy and beautiful girl is the most popular object for men in the new era. I hope that the gentlemen in Shanghai will invite their girlfriends and sisters to swim and play ball more often in the summer. If you take them to the cinema or dance hall, where the air is turbid and the population is mixed, it is the most unwise and uneconomical behavior. (Li Mingmin)</p>
<h3>Lack of Activity in the Ping Pong World, Everyone Should Catch Up</h3>
<p>Ping pong is one of the best full-body exercises. The inventor is Mr. Gibb. Since it entered our country, it has been more than thirty years, and in the last ten years, the enthusiasm of the Chinese people has been no less than that of football and tennis. Because it is easy to hold, there is no seasonal restraint, and men, women, old and young can practice, and there is absolutely no danger. The Far East is the most active in promoting it, and among China, Shanghai and Hong Kong have the most people playing. Especially in Shanghai, there are many teams and talented people. Various championship competitions are held continuously, with strong interest and enthusiasm. The situation of its widespread development is almost above other sports. The National Games has also been listed as a formal championship event. This is all due to the hard work and leadership of the Shanghai Ping Pong Federation.</p>
<p>The recent situation in the Shanghai ping pong world is quite calm. Since the Tongren Cup and Zhongxi Cup ended last summer, it has entered a state of decline. On the contrary, the enthusiasm for small football and the sensation of big football make people sigh with the feeling that today is not what it used to be.</p>
<p>It is found that there are hundreds of ping pong groups in Shanghai, but in this difficult period of housing shortage, there are very few teams that have well-equipped ballrooms and are still active in the ping pong world. Only the San Yi, Xin Ya, and Postal Services teams are worthy of mention. San Yi was established nearly ten years ago, initiated by Mr. Wang Lianyuan of Wei Feng Yarn Factory. At that time, the lineup was very strong. It was originally intended to win the championship in the second competition arena, but unfortunately, it was sacrificed by the Guangzhong team in the final, lost the championship, and then dissolved invisibly. At the beginning of the Tongren Cup, the team was reorganized by Chen Jimao, a veteran of ping pong, and Wang Jingyuan, a master of short block. They also invited Zhang Ying, a famous player in this port, to join and help. It was smooth sailing. In the final, thanks to the efforts of Pu Kun and Gang Zhuan, they defeated Qinglian with a score of 4 to 3 and won the overall championship. Soon after, the all-round master Fan Hankun... All the second-rate players... Chu Yang, Wang Chang... Zhicheng, Li... etc. came one after another. Talent was abundant, and they occupied a place on the Shanghai stage. In the Zhongxi Cup competition, Zhao Gongjun selected a group of good players in the name of Yi Yi to participate in the A group competition. As a result, San Yi and Yi Yi both won the top spot with a winning record, showing their strength. Xin Ya was organized by Mr. Xin Yacai, the owner of the restaurant, and Zhao Shijie. Yun Cheng was the captain, and Zhao Chao was the general manager. Players such as Li Shaoguang, Yang Hanhong, Zhou Shaosong, Peng Guisheng, Chen Shaoping, and Wei Zhuan were all outstanding among the rising stars. The team successively won the Kong Sheng Cup, the Li Yulin Group of the Kong Sheng Cup, the third runner-up of the third Xinliu Cup, and the runner-up of the third Zhongsi Cup. Especially in the Shanghai Individual Ping Pong Competition this spring, Yang Hanhong won the runner-up, and Li Shaoguang and Huang... won the fifth and sixth places respectively. Among the Shanghai representative players, the team won three seats. With such good results, it is indeed commendable. It is an unprecedented grand occasion in the ping pong world, and the hard work of Mr. Xin Zhao in leading the team is invaluable. As for the Postal Services team, it has long been famous in the ping pong world. Ten years ago, famous players such as Zhou Xiulu, Li Chuan, Wang Huizhang, and Zhu Wenzhi were all generals under its command, and their brilliance shone for a time in the Joint Cup... When players such as Lu Jun were first transferred to other places, it affected their strength, causing them to succumb to teams such as Qinglian and Youbang in recent years. Although there are currently generals such as Mei Chunshan, Ye Xiuzhang, Liu Zhaoshi, Chen Wensheng, Ji Guangwang, and Zhu... in the lineup, it is not weak. If they can unite as one, it will not be difficult to restore the brilliance of the past. (Chen Linsheng)</p>

<h3>Athletes Should Pay Attention to Amateur Sports Rules</h3>
<p>In recent years, all circles in Shanghai have spared no effort in promoting sports, with a flourishing trend, and attention has also been paid to the amateur status of athletes. It has been found that our country has stipulated "Amateur Sports Rules," which are similar to those stipulated by various sports organizations in the world. The main points of these rules are extracted and published below for the reference of the sports community.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Amateur Sports</p>
<p>The amateur qualifications of Chinese athletes participating in various sports competitions at the international, national, regional, provincial, and municipal levels are defined as follows: 1. The purpose of their participation in sports is solely for the love of sports. Definition of Amateur Sports</p>
<p>Article 1 An amateur athlete participates in competitions only for the love of sports. Article 2 If an athlete participates in any sports competition for money or other benefits, or takes extra benefits in the form of clothing and accommodation that they should not receive, then the athlete will become a professional athlete in any sport. Article 3 If an athlete knowingly violates the rules and competes in the same team or against a professional athlete without the permission of the competent authority, they will become a professional athlete. Article 4 Anyone who teaches, trains, or directs athletes, or is employed in any sports work and receives a salary, is a professional athlete. Article 5 Anyone who knowingly becomes a professional athlete will never be able to restore their amateur status. Article 6 An amateur athlete must not engage in money gambling or betting in any sports competition they participate in. Article 7 An amateur athlete must not participate in any sports competition that seeks prizes or souvenirs that cannot be priced. Article 8 The value of the prizes obtained by amateur athletes must not exceed one hundred local silver coins: but this does not apply to those who have been specially authorized by the national formal sports organization. Article 9 Amateur athletes must not sell, pawn, or donate the prizes they have won to others. These prizes must be preserved for inspection by the formal sports organization at any time. Article 10 An amateur athlete must not impersonate or use the name of another person to join any competition.</p>
<p>Article 11 An amateur athlete must not register any membership fees or other income, except for the actual expenses of train and boat tickets when attending competitions or returning from sports meets. Article 12 An amateur athlete must not accept sponsorship or any expenses for their trainers, team members, or spectators. (To be continued)</p>
