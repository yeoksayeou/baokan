<p>社評</p>
<h3>證券交易所復業問題</h3>
<p>證券市塲之作用，在使擁資者可以覓得正當投資之途徑，並選擇其所擬投資之對象，求資者可以迅速募集其所需要之資金，故證券之於促進企業發展，實具有特別重要性，經濟學家楊蔭溥氏在其所著一中國交易所論中，論及證券市塲之於促進企業發展，其言曰：</p>
<p>「股票不能流通於市面，則募股旣難，而股份有限公司之組織，即不能十分發達，蓋投資者及商人均以資金之能流通爲要義，斷不願以活動之資金，購不流動之股票，自有股票交易所之設立，則股票旣有流通之機關，而股票公司亦可隨之而發達，且自有票據交易市塲，而債券之發行，亦自易於流通，企業集資，益易着手，企業發展，益有進步。」</p>
<p>吾人倘以企業先進各國股份有限公司發展情形與楊氏之言相印證，實覺仟何國家，苟欲着手發展大規模之新式工業，必先從設立資本市塲—證劵市塲—入手，蓋非如此，則大量之資金無從集，有之唯利用外資而已。楊氏所言僅着眼於工業，尙嫌過狹，實則農業發展，市政建設，有賴於證券市塲協助之前例，亦復甚多。如德國農業長期貸款，數額甚鉅，有裨於農業發達者非淺，即由於各農業金融機構所發行之農業債券，可以在證劵市塲流通之故。吾國農工業均極落後，擴充發展，端恃能有大量之資金流通，舍從速恢復投資市塲以外，實感無法籌集，而欲遏止投機，導納游資於生產之正途，亦實唯投資市塲是賴，故吾人對於華商證券交易所之復業，實感異常需要。</p>
<p>華商證券交易所，成立於民國九年，直至中日事變以後，方吿停頓，近則奉財政部令籌備復業，過去證券交易，僅限於政府公債之買　，故對於實業界之貢獻，尙少表現，今後爲應時代之需要起見，自應以增加流通各項生產證券，引爲復業後之最大責任，至於如何防止投機，穩定價格，及嚴格審查上塲證券，均與社會金融之安定有關，交易所於復業之初，尤應特加硏究。蓋恢復證券市塲之最大目的，爲使證券交易，趨於正軌，以協助國民經濟之發展與實業之繁榮，故交易所今後工作之進行，應時時以此爲準則。</p>
<p>交易所制度，英美與大陸不同，英美採取放任主義，大陸則採取干涉主義，吾國向係採用大陸制度，在此社會經濟狀態動盪不定之際，人民心理，大半趨於投機，欲求證劵交易，完全不爲投機之對象，其勢或有所不能，唯有希望政府，對於監督方面，益求嚴密，如禁止期貨交易，如限制銀行以股票作押款，如微收證券交易利得稅，皆不失爲防止過分投機之補救辦法。</p>
<p>交易所理事會之所應切實執行者爲上塲股票必須經過嚴格之審查，絕對不得稍涉情感，或爲任何力量所支配，更宜嚴格規定合格標準，使執行審查者，無應付之困難，無通融之餘地，其尤應特別揭櫫者，厥爲一切上塲證券均須爲與戰時國民經濟有關之各項事業，非此則無論其資信如何殷實，歷史如何悠久，管理如何完善，亦不應允許其上塲，庶社會資金，悉得爲適合於戰時經濟之運用。</p>
<p>近來股票市價，一再上漲，固受物價上漲之聯帶影響，而股票商號之可以自已買賣，恐亦不無從中左右市價之重大嫌疑，將來交易所復業以後，對於經紀人之自已買賣，是否將絕對禁止，或加以限制，或允許自由，在交易所復業以前，亦應預爲硏究決定。</p>
<p>最後有爲交易所吿者，過去日本證劵交易所十一家，爲適合時局之需要，已由日本政府加以合併改造，其一切辦法，均力求適合時代精神，爲資借鏡起見，正不妨多多參考。</p>

<h3>微妙的美蘇關係</h3>
<p>蘇聯當局在六月二十二日德蘇開戰紀念日的特別公報上，對英美二國要求立即開闢第二戰綫。</p>
<p>斯達林不用婉轉的言辭，而直截爽快地提出展開第二戰綫的要求，英美自己也知道在這世界戰局的決定的時機快將到來的今日，不能再用那一套抽象的囈語了，現在必須表現怎樣才能使蘇聯贊同的方策。先前曾指摘蘇聯「忘恩」而引起問題的美國駐蘇大使史丹萊，最近又發阿諛蘇聯之辭說：</p>
<p>「英美蘇間之友好關係，現在漸達最高峯，這種現狀，即在將來亦不能不加以維持。」</p>
<p>一面羅斯福目前向美國參院要求剔除美國外交陣中的反蘇份子，對國務院蘇聯司長勞合韓德生以釀成美蘇間的猜疑爲理由而要求罷免，華盛頓各報稱頌羅斯福「用極眞摯的態度以謀美蘇諒解的密切化」，羅斯福的道種措置和史丹萊的聲明，無一不在奉承蘇聯，敷衍蘇聯。除此以外，至於說到眞正在準備或檢討怎樣開闢第二戰綫，則根本未曾加以考慮，祇取隔岸觀火的態度，坐視蘇聯的掙扎。上述韓德生之脫離國務院而就任新駐伊拉克公使，據稱是因爲特別嚴重注視蘇聯的對西亞態度及高加索方面情勢。由此我們可以看出美國奉承與監視之兼籌並顧的老謀深算的企圖。當東部戰綫微妙的時候，美蘇關係依然强烈地感到一種藕斷絲連的狀態。（翼：譯自六月二十九日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>新佐治亞島　日軍獲偉大戰果　小艇二十艘被撀沉　敵登陸企圖吿失敗</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日大本營十五日三時三十分發表：（一）新佐治亞島之日守備隊，十四日於海岸地區邀拏國　魯比來納向孟達東側地區上陸之美軍，拏沉敵艇二十艘，其殘餘者已被　完全退走。（二）已進出於孟達東方地區之美軍一部，復興前者相呼應，前來攻擊，即被日守備隊擊退。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　敵軍爲圓奪取日軍前線基地新佐治亞島之孟達，故逞其向前推進基地之野心，於六月卅日在倫特巴島登陸。同時使各部隊在新佐治亞島西北岸之賴斯灣及東南岸登陸，顯示奪取孟達之情勢，自此以後該方面即連日連夜分在海陸空軍三方面展開熱烈之戰鬥。又進出於孟達南方三公里魯比來納島之敵軍，亦與新佐治亞島西北東西兩岸之敵軍呼應，企圖自孟達東側地區上陸，及於十四日八時起大放煙幕，於九時開始上陸，敵軍此次所用上陸舟艇計共七十艘，其中半數載兵員，其他半數則滿載軍需品，日海岸守備隊當即與此項敵軍接近，　一舉將　殘　，於是一實開始迎戰，予以猛烈轟擊。同時後方　　，亦立即出擊，於是孟達東側地區海邊瞬即化爲激烈戰場。敵軍上陸軍舟艇　遭日方巨彈射擊，狼狽不堪，當有二十艇被日方擊沉，其餘亦悉陷於混　狀態，爭先恐後紛紛敗退。到縫合線敵之登陸及全被擊破，敵兵一名亦未稍能登陸　　，即大敗而去，總計是役敵軍兵之員之損害確達千二三百名。另一方面新佐治亞島東南岸登陸，企圖　窺爆孟達之敵軍，雖會自（相州）右岸出擊，但遭日軍部隊之果敢攔擊，又蒙受重大損害而敗退。敵軍此次在南太平洋方面之反攻，雖尚在繼續進行，但日軍必勝戰略態勢之基礎，仍　稍動搖。且因日陸海空三軍之勇敢善鬥，已予敵以重創。計自六月三十日以來，共擊敵艇船達三十一艘，舟艇多數，擊落敵機二百架以上，敵之兵員損失亦有一萬數千人。</p>
<h3>日中央協力會議　開會之第二日　四委員會分別討論要案　首相說明確立決戰生活</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社　日東條首相於十五日出席中央協力會議第四委員會時，要求發言後，即起立說明日本國民生活，並鄭重提出日本國民除確保自己生活外，同時必須常存確保大東亞十億民衆的生活之念。其大意謂：確保今日日本一億國民之生活，　帳目應以全部責任處理之，並與諸君協力行之，但爲達到此次大東亞戰爭之目的，換言之，即爲使大東亞領域内各國各民族各得其所起見，必須更確保住居此大東亞領域内三十億人民的生活，此點務望加以諒察。當運營此日常生活之際，日本自身當然爲極大對象，但一方面則須常以十億人民爲對象。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日中央協力會議，十五日續開第二日會議。上午八時起第一決戰精神·第二戰力增強生產·第三糧食國內自給非常生產·第四決戰生活等四委員會，分別同時開會，討論各議員所提之全部議案。在各委員長統裁之下，以自由討論之形式實行審議，是日東條首相先出席第四委員會，聽取國民代表登氏　確立決戰生活之經騐談，安藤內相爲眾厚相·內閣各省次官·以及局長課長等百餘人均分別列席各委員會，此足以顯示日政府方面之熱誠，且答復　員之垂問，官民打成一片，討論必勝方案，而充分發揮中央協力會議之精神，是日所討論這案中，第一委員會爲思想決戰與官民協力，國民指導委員爲企業整備與礦工業勞務等要案，第三委員會爲指導供出公米及　仛生產，第四委員會爲確立戰爭生活中生活必　物資之配給及儲蓄防空等要案。各委員會均全日討議不稍休息，至下午六時始行散會。</p>

<h3>栗原大佐繼任　日海軍報道課長　平出調任軍令部課長</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日海軍省十五日發表：日大本營海軍報道部課長平出英夫大佐，繼任軍令部課長。報道部課長遺缺由栗原悅藏大佐繼任，按平出大佐於民國二十九年七月自義國返國後，即任大本營報道部長，三年來於報道戰綫之第一綫上縱　活躍，殊樹偉動，近因身體欠佳，且任職已久，因乃與栗原大佐交替。栗原大佐過去於軍隊中得知決戰階段中戰局之現狀，此次就任報道部課長乃爲最適任者。今後栗原大佐將對英美展開宣傳戰之決戰，按栗原大佐昭和四年十一月海軍大學畢業，曾任榛名艦副砲長，昭和十年十一月進陞中佐、十一年十二月任軍務局局員，十二年十一月就任大本營海軍報道部部員，十四年榮升大佐後，歷任上海方面根據地隊參謀課等職。同年十二月任佐世保鎭守府參謀，十五年十一月入軍令部，其後任軍令部課長以至於今。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　發表抱負</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日栗原悅藏大佐此次繼本出大佐之後，任海軍報道部課長，十五日接見海軍省記者團時，即脫明新任抱負。大意謂：余鍳於決戰下報道之使命，實深感責任之重大，余對報道宣傳工作，案爲門外漢，平出大佐在任時，曾立偉功，今繼其後任，尤不能不竭力以赴。近來之戰局正是決戰情勢，敵軍進行反攻作戰，現正確趨熾烈，但以爲最高度發揮國家總力，實爲今日之急務，因此日本一億國民尤望且有竭盡全力，以貢獻於戰爭之決意，全國國民揩爲生產戰士，故尤必須切記此咱決意，實與所羅門海域有直接關係，關於思想戰，則以現有一切力量貢獻國家而充分發揮實爲勝利之原動力，更須提高「紙弱」之命中率，使彈無虛發，並望認清當發目標，而作百發百中之射擊。</p>

<h3>土叙邊界　將再度封鎖</h3>
<p>斯凡埠十五日中央社電　路透社稱　昨晚在此間獲悉：土耳其與叙利亞間之邊界，將於今日或明日再度封鎖，此舉之原因未宣布。</p>
<h3>智利巴拉圭　訂友好公約</h3>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒十五日中央社電　據智利京城消息：巴拉圭總統莫裡尼哥訪問智京時，曾由智巴兩國外長簽訂兩國間之和平友誼公約。事後巴總統即乘飛機赴玻利維亞之拉巴斯。同時又據阿根廷外交部宣布：巴拉圭總統已接受阿國之邀請，定於九月間訪阿。</p>
<h3>西西里軸心軍　準備總反攻　喀太尼亞英傘兵被殲　美軍在吉拉四周受挫</h3>
<p>沮列克十五日中央社電　西西裡軸心軍生力業已完成反攻之準備，該島軍事似正趨向決定之項點。據傳吉拉以東現有激戰，　軍精銳戈林師團刻正進攻美方之第七軍，又有英加聯軍與德義軍隊激戰於福洛裡達亞附近。倫敦軍事皆料軸心軍將由北面發動，反攻英之第八軍，聞英美之空中偵察，曾發現多數軸心鐵甲縱隊，現由巴特諾向喀太尼亞移動，喀太尼亞一片平原爲最合理想之坦克軍戰場。同時據柏林來訊：謂英美軍即在軸心軍總反攻之前，亦將被迫保持守勢，蓋因英美有等待充分援軍與接濟之必要。目前西西裡亞之陸地戰事。計有美軍之努力擴展其所成立之橋頭堡，德義先頭部隊之加強抵抗，使英美登陸部隊不能打通至該島內地之山路。北非反軸心軍總懷念部公布：目前西島最激烈戰事，集中於吉拉四周，美軍曾在該處大受頓挫。據最近消息：軸心軍鐵甲部隊曾猛攻反軸心軍右　喀太尼亞之英第八軍及其右翼里卡加太之美軍。就目前觀察，殆可斷定反軸心之兩　，決難繼續深入，因軸心軍鐵甲部隊現處於有利之地位，可擊退進犯之連隊也。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　星期二夜間曾有英傘兵約一團之衆，降落於喀太尼亞平原，當被德軍予以解決，英本方擬施行奇　，初不料其降落之處，適爲德軍展開之地也。英傘兵開始降落後一小時内大部份已被擊斃或俘獲。</p>
<p>東南海岸　大戰方酣</p>
<p>柏林十五日電中央社電　　通社軍事訪員電　。西西裡東南之戰事，已發展爲大規模之　戰，因英美軍獲得源源不絕之增援後，業已恢復其向内地入侵之企圖也，英美空軍在上述戰爭事中，協助作　甚爲得力，同時軸心軍之抵抗極爲堅強，對於寸土亦不輕易放棄，仲英美軍隊受非常重大之損失，昨據義方公報公布：英美軍已打通至西西裡東南山岳地帶與喀　尼亞平原之道路，此可謂反軸心軍在西島東南部極點處之最大土地佔領，自守軍觀點而言，該區自始　認爲有暴露之危險。拟目前情形推測，英第八軍與美第七軍，似已在該區成立接觸，須知反軸心重在最初數日之戰事中，即努力從事於此種會合也。軸心軍攻勢之主的壓力，現集中　奧古　塔以北與西北之區域。該方面之蒙甘茂萊　軍所部坦克軍隊得軍　之協助，刻正向喀太尼亞加緊迫。按喀太民經亞爲西島第二大城，顯然爲英軍前進之目標，倘使英美軍果能完成其佔領該島全部東海岸至米西那爲止之作戰計劃，則不啻切　全島與義大利大奸賊之聯絡，但軸心軍指揮部對於必要之反抗手段，早已錄務妥當，則可斷言也。</p>
<p>義軍發表　激戰情況</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　義軍當局十五日下午一時發表：西西裡島戰綫西起裡加太灣東達奧古斯塔灣，又於東岸之山嶽地區以及喀太尼亞平原，十二日以來似又有反軸心軍部隊登陸增援，幫於百五十公里之全面戰綫上展開激戰。按反軸心軍東西兩翼之連絡向未成功，然德軍當局頃　承認英第八軍與美第七軍在西西里島東南部拉古薩及瑪迭加附近已連絡成功，又以裡卡太及吉拉兩港爲中心之反軸心軍，得增援部隊之援助後，似又在東方及北方前進少許。目下反軸心軍戰爭之第一重點，即爲佔據喀太尼亞平原，頃似正企圖在東岸之艦隊砲火掩護下，自奧古斯塔逐次前進。</p>
<p>英美船艦　損失重大</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　軸心空軍曾於星期二日午後，轟沉滿載軍隊與軍需品之反軸心登陸艦四艘·大型運輸軍火艦兩艘·及三千餘噸供應艦一艘·又有巡洋艦一艘·貨船三艘·共一萬四千噸，益均受重創。自七月十日至十三日之間，德空軍所擊沉與轟毀之反軸心艦船共計三十四艘，總計約十六萬噸，受創各船之中，多有受創過重不　修理者。此外倘有英美戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，與驅逐艦一艘，亦直接被炸彈投中。</p>
<h3>義南部城市　宣布爲戰區</h3>
<p>羅馬十五日中央社電　今日官方宣稱：南部義大利之坎尼亞省及其首都那不勒斯城，與路卡尼亞省及其首都玻頓石城，已宣佈爲戰事區域。</p>
<h3>波新閣成立</h3>
<p>葡京十五日中央社電　據海能社訊，倫敦消息，薛柯斯基交軍隊　在道布羅陀　機殞命後，密柯拉傑齊克已繼任波蘭流亡政府内閣總理，願基時將軍仛國防　長，以　原定由索斯諾斯基將軍擔任此職，波蘭駐埃及公使孫茂已　任外長，倫敦消息靈通人士稱，英政府反對索斯諾斯基任國防部長，因渠之態度不利於蘇波下爭端之解決。</p>
<h3>維希與渝方　斷絕外交關係</h3>
<p>廣州十五日中央社電　頃據渝悉，法國駐渝大使館彭克爾等全體館員頃奉本國命令，決定撤離重慶。因維希政府適應東亞新事態，最近對國民政府實施交還租界及撤消治外法權，渝方對此亦曾屢次向維希提出抗議，同時並將重慶駐維希當局之外交機關退至裡斯本，事實上重慶維希之外交關係業已斷絕。</p>
<h3>東綫沉寂</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　據海通社訊:數日來東綫除奧勒爾及貝爾哥洛特區域外，他處戰况沉寂。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德元首　管十四日發表，蘇軍於貝爾哥洛特區，且遭甚大損害。又蘇軍在奧勒爾東方及北方，以增援部隊實行猛攻，德軍則以預備兵加以反擊。過去數日間蘇軍在該方面損毀坦克車二百輛以上，德空軍有力部隊曾參加東綫戰鬥，炸毀蘇軍多數坦克車，擊落蘇機二百十二架。</p>
<h3>法國慶日　巴黎空襲</h3>
<p>巴黎十五日中央社電　海通社訊：昨日爲法國共和紀念日，晨間有英美飛機一百五十架，轟炸巴黎近郊，死傷平民二百五五人。截至昨日傍晚已發見尸體五十三具，此外有二〇二人知已受傷，居屋被毀者一百餘所。敵機四架被擊落內有四引擎巨型機一架。</p>
<p>維希十五日中央社電　據海通社訊：英機於前夜在法國傑拉區沙尼爾　投燃燒片多枚，焚燬農場四處，傷三人。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫　前攝政病劇</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十五日中央社電　據海通社倫敦消息，英外相艾登昨日在下　宣布：南斯拉夫之保祿親王於一九四一年爲攝政時，曾希望避免戰禍因而遭反軸心之逮捕，在根雅患病甚劇，現應醫士之緊急要求，已將其遷至南非療養。</p>
<h3>駐漢日總領談　收回滬租界問題</h3>
<p>漢口十五日中央社電　關於收回上海公共租界，武漢中央分社記者頃專訪漢口日總領事高津氏，叩詢觀感，當蒙發表意見，略謂，中日條款簽署後，未及一月，公共租界即將於八月一日收回，誠爲中國國權恢復道上，值得紀念之一頁。滬公共租界爲美英侵略中國之策源地，故其收回實爲至難之事。今因中國之參戰，積極推進戰爭政策，中國乃得償其百年宿願，公共租界之收回，使國府完全發揮其統治力，於政治上經濟上及文化上，均有重大之影響，國府之強化及復興，由此可知。</p>
<h3>華北展開　興亞翼贊運動</h3>
<p>華北興亞翼贊會本部的創立式，於八日午後一時起在北京東城的興亞公館舉行。會長盬澤公使，以及副會長代表華北開發副總裁山西以下的職員均準時出席。來賓到有大東亞大臣代表島津，大東亞省鍊成課長華北軍大城戶部隊長代表西村部隊長。華北政務委員長兼新民會長王克敏，政務廳長張仲直，新民會副會長喻熙傑等，並各支部分會的事務局長，各地的　贊事務擔任官等約百餘名。行禮　儀後，開始討論，推山西開發副總裁爲主席，由北京大使館錬成課長三原說明華北興亞運動指導方針要綱並華北興亞翼贊會規約，一致通過，繼由盬澤會長任命職員，並說明預算案而付表決，議程遂告終了。嗣再由盬澤會長，大東亞大臣代表島津，大城戶部隊長代表西村，委員長王克敏相繼致詞並致祝辭，宣詔大政翼贊會總裁東條之祝電，最後由副會長代表山西致詞，先後二時許，此具有深刻意義創立會遂告終了，華北四十萬日人組織之核心，官民協力之最高指導體華北興亞翼贊會，於是開始正式工作了。創立會告終後，略事休息，即繼續舉行本部各職員各地翼贊事務擔任官，事務局長等之聯席會議，交換翼贊運動的意見，逾六時始行散會，創立會上盬澤會長致詞的要旨如次：</p>
<p>爲響應昭和十五年在本國開始的大政翼贊運動，故在華北當地日本人也即展開翼贊運動，但迄今還沒有一貫的有機的組織，不但如此，他們且忽略了居住在中國及中國人之間，他們不想到與中國有共同的目標，理想。因此，爲響應此次日本對華政策的轉變，乃想使興業運動有更進一步的進展。不梢說，日本的八紘爲宇之崇高的肇國精神，也就是建設大東亞新秩序之共同理想。這共同的最高指標即是興亞理念，而其實現也就是興亞運動的實體，尤其是華北，與日本有極密切的關係，在這裏的日本人，須向著中日共通的理想目標，互相提携協力，以表現大東亞新秩序的模範地區，華北就是興亞運動所最應該首先具現的培養基地，此次所以特爲構成朝野協力一體之強固的一元的組織，以積極地展開興亞翼贊運動者，其緣故即在於此，希望居留華北的四十萬日本人，經過這強靱的組織，保持穩死爲心，對內　向日本舉大政翼贊運動之實，對外則與中國方面的興亞運動協力，實踐日本之崇高遠大的肇國精神，對華北的建設，協力　進。（鴻·譯自七月十一日西部朝日新聞北京電）</p>

<p>上野氏介紹出版</p>
<p>繼由上野氏介紹。日本之出版事業稱：關於日本出版之刊物，約有三千餘種，其中一千種爲　關刊物性質一二千種爲民間經　者、但其有優良地位者則僅四五百家而已。因此對大東亞共榮　之文化敎育等工作之推進感覺力量不足，故集合日本文化出版界各巨頭組成大束亞出版公司及出版文化研究所以此推進大東亞文化出版事業進而奠定其新的基礎，大東亞之文化建設事業，以大陸中國最爲重要，故同人等決對中國之文化予以再研究，但此尙屬啓蒙時間，盼望各位予以指敎協力，至過去日本對中國文化出版以及經濟各問題，雖研究頗多，而無特別成就，其最大原因在於太重形式而缺少實際、且對中國之現實情形認議太淺，故殊少圓滿結果，今後當希望能做到言行一致，以完成我人文化硏究之使命也。</p>
<p>山田氏發抒意見</p>
<p>旋由山田氏發表意見稱：本人對貴國新聞事業，實屬「門外漢」，平時甚少研究，惟我人所知者，爲上海新聞界與出版界所負　命十分重大耳，但因賴於各位之努力，能完成其使命，其决我人對日本出版物之意見，誠如上野氏所說出版物雖多而成名者能有多少，至不易改進之原因或即係不切實際一點，我人當硏究其癥結何在而予以改善，同時並盼各位盡量指正，我人極願接受也。</p>
<p>舉行懇談盡歡而散</p>
<p>繼即開始懇談，由山田氏波多博氏等　翁永淸程仲權諸君等提出之意見，分別予以切實答覆，據稱，今日日本之報紙固實行合併，但雜誌一項亦己漸次實行，惟因行銷中國之著名雜誌仍維持其原有狀態，中國人士頗多不能明　此事，事實上日本雜誌大部已實行合併矣。關於日本報紙刊戰中國消息，在量的方面，較中國報紙刊登日本消息爲少一點，據波多博氏稱，因大束亞戰爭趨於決勝階設，故各報均注重戰事消息，且因　輻有限，故或有此種現象，但在過去。則各報對中國消息之刊載並不亞於中國躲紙，並據波多博氏稱，日本各學校與鄕村之學童都已學習華文華語，而摒素敵性英文，故對將來中日文化上貢獻必多云云，按大東亞出版公司與出版文化硏究所。係於今春　吿成立，純粹爲民間組織，從事文化出版之研究，現除出版各種戰事畫刊，介紹日本眞勢情形於大東亞共榮圈南洋各地外，並將準備出版華文。印緬文，及南洋版等書籍且完全注重於文藝學術一類，必要時決將中日有名書籍互譯介紹與兩國人士，並請中國人士執筆實現中日文化交流，聞該公司總社　東京都，將來爲加强工作。或將在上海設　分社最後由新聞聯合會任雲鵬向二氏介紹上　新聞聯合脅槪况及一般現狀甚詳，至七時許始盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>統一推進慈善事業聲中　貧病救濟協會訪問記（二）　爲什麼不自辦事業？</h3>
<p>爲什麼只注力於扶助既成善團而不自辦慈善事業呢？這是一個很有趣但是很重要的問題，該會負責人　重地指出：這一問題還包含兩個問題；第一，爲什麼上有這麼多的慈善機關，而事實上上　市上還是充滿着急待救濟的苦難者？第二，是不是　該另起爐竈創辦一個大規模的慈善團體來統辦慈善事業？這兩個問題，該會發起人曾經細心硏究過。他們的結論是；第一，現有慈善團體不能盡庇上　苦難同胞的原因，主要的是由於客觀環境不允　，自然要牽涉到政治經濟文化諸端，暫且不談，次要的是由於各慈善團體主　的缺陷，就是（（一）經費不充足，（二）計劃不妥善，（三）管理不得法，客觀的原因，有待於他方面的努力，主觀的原因，我們可以駿法補救與改善，上海市貧病救濟協會之注力於扶助各既成慈善團體以推進慈善事業者，其第一個根據在此。第二，爲什麼不自辦慈善事業呢？誠然，一般心理，似乎自辦事業，則勸募的成績也許會更好些。但是，對於慈善事業是否就有實效呢？這倒是一個極大的疑問：因爲（（一）從物賀設施上說，現在上　各既成善團的房屋，地產，內部　備，其資產之大，簡直是無法估計的，縱以團家全年度預算的極大部分來辦，恐怕也辦不到—例如徐家匯和洋涇浜聖母院，土山灣孤兒院以及普育堂的基業，多是數十年以至百年來積漸以成，決不是一部份人短時期內所能置備的。（二）從人材方面說，上海三百三十多個慈善團體，各依其事業部門而有其專門人材，從數十年來慘淡經營的各社團主持人，以至任勞任怨，無名無利，犧牲服務，數十年如一日的實際工作人員，天主，基督敎的博愛，佛敎的慈悲，儒敎的老老幼幼，這種精神以及扶養老　殘廢，敎育孤貧兒童種種服務道德與技能，都不是任何學校所能訓練出來的，（三）從事業方而說，各善團都已在敏十年以至百年來辦有相當成績，久獲中外各方的贊譽，更不是什麼初創的團體所能　嗟辦到的，上海市貧病救濟協會之注力於扶導旣成社團而不自辦事業，第二個根據在此。</p>
<h3>米糧陸續到滬　下期口糧可能照原有數量</h3>
<p>本市民食情形，雖屢經當局强調聲明決無匱乏之虞，而米糧聯營社亦擬設法自外埠運米來滬接濟，但人民對於此一問題之關懷，迄未稍减，良以此事攸關民生至鉅，殊不容一刻漠視也。上海社記者昨以此質　消息靈通方面，據稱當局感於人民對於民食期望之殷，自將於最相當之期間以內，廓淸各方之焦慮，而使五百萬民衆生計所繫之民食在明朗化之表現，庶幾米糧之來源不絕於途，同時戶口糧暫减之現象，亦可消滅，當局深知如欲達此目的，第一必須促進運輸之便利，俾產區之糧食可無稱延運滬應市，第二必須改良收購方式，尤以收購價格一點，宜顧全農民之利益，按照其生產成水，訂定最合理之價標，則農民樂願將米產出售。無論如何，在常前食米配給權移交華方掌理之際，各種不能預見之困難，自屬難免，但爲民生着想，人民應竭力防制食米黑市，當局暨職司食米採辦運銷之機關，更當擔荷保障民生之責任，方能達到眞正穩定之境。</p>
<p>聯營社米已有</p>
<p>（中央社滬訊）本市食米問題，各界均極關懷，上海區米糧聯營社，探自蘇揚湖三區之白來二十萬石，已於十日起絡續抵滬，此後儘可大量源源來滬，且下期起之口糧，定可恢復原有數量。</p>
<h3>華北急賑會　議購賑糧</h3>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>再論華股集中交易</h3>
<p>六月二十二日本欄「輪華股集中交易」，認爲在目前的環境下，證券交易所的復業，將爲必成的事實。而於其意教，則分爲三點說明；當時曾有一部份人士懷疑於證券交易所的能否在這佃時候復業，殊不知正因爲這個時候，才有證劵交易所復業的必要，，現在事實吿訴我們了，證券交易所已決定於本月二十四日舉行股東　，並預定於八月中旬復業。</p>
<p>爲什麼證券交易所要在這個時候復業？掃除股票業商各自爲政的營業行爲，推進股票事業的圓滑周轉，誘導社會游資進入民族資本的生產部門，都足成爲理由的，而最重要的理由、則爲收囘租界後的上海經濟喝必須加以調整，加以統一，不容再有雜亂無章的經濟行爲，而在機構與人事方面，允須澈底調整統一，正如七月三日大陸新報所言：「上海爲中國經濟心臟區，一切關係、萬分重大；租界接收以後，希望對於負責實際工作的人選與機構，特別的愼重考慮調整。」眞的，必須如此。而後一切經濟行爲，始可以一元化，以達於眞正完善的姿態，股票業商的營業行爲，既以證券交易所的復業爲其調整統一的媒介，其他方面的種種經濟行爲，尤其是囤積行爲，則尤有賴於「適當機關」之成立，與其組織之强化。</p>
<h3>本月來十一家行荘　依法增加資金</h3>
<p>國民政府財政部，爲整理滬市各小銀行錢莊，鞏固金融機關之基礎起見，特頒布銀行登記章程及修正信託公司登記暫行條例，訓令本市銀錢兩業公會，通飭各會員行莊根據新規定及法令增加資本，茲悉，除銀行方面於前分別增資者十三家外，尙有四十餘家正在進行增資中，本月一日起至昨日止，各行莊依照修正銀行註冊章程將原有資本予以增加者，計有一大增加資本一百三十萬元，正泰增加資本一百萬元、元賚增加資本一百九十二萬二千五一百元，建　增加資本一百一五十萬元，同盛增加資本二百萬元，天一增加資本四百二十五萬，，正華增加資本二百五十萬元，信孚增加資本一百五十萬元，上海信託增加資本二百萬元，利　　託增加資本九百萬元，泰　增加資本二百萬元，共計十一家行莊增資云。</p>
<h3>本年華中棉花　收購良好</h3>
<p>本年度之棉花收購，於本月底之數萬擔棉花運抵上海後即可完畢。自去年十一月起收購當局依照華中棉花統制令收買以來，至本月底止，其所獲總數量，可與去年度所獲相等，棉花收購，爲生活必需之農產物資收購之第一步，能有如此成績，實非易易云。（七月十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>漢物資統制分會　積極籌備中</h3>
<p>漢口十五日中央社電　本市物資統制總會武漢分會　備委員，中日方面各六人，開始積極籌備以來，關於內部人事，亦在審愼考核中，　分會章則，並已推定李鼎安等四人，參照總會組織條例，負責起草，一俟覓定籌備處後，即開始正式辦公。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股先疾進後猛退，　動莫測，走勢於金價同，且初承上日午收左右混亂漲勢，後爲見高吐售者所壓下，照各方向上之人心已見動搖，且同業深感股價之一味上升過巨，謀起抑止，成交轉稀。南洋烟公司有瘋狂巨變，晨初之一剎那結果軋升最巨。大中華火柴關口銜出後已見囘入，問北水電及華商電氣漲勢已緩。百貨業永安公司後亦見同下，新新及國貨公司盤升亦勁，內衣及景綸，景福兩衫　在飛躍中。紡織業挺升亦多盤。永安紡織上漲亦遲，小票面中之大中華織造忽爲某戶買進驟抬上，國信染織。新　印染挺升未已。文化業世界書局軋升最巨，商務及中華所升較微，新藥業信誼亦升不同，中法與新亞軋升亦勁，中國鐘廠大關在望，公信電器有成交。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>金銀　今晨本市銀樓業大新同行首飾金，門市每兩雖然仍照限價兌出、手續費亦不變，但實際上毫無交易，業外亦有行無市，價　混亂，初開時步升，迫近大關，後竟超過關外、及至午刻，囘至　上，紋銀價亦較昨日上升。</p>
<p>拆息　錢業公會拆息，仍掛二角四分未更。</p>
<p>公債　昨又轉堅，人心似猶作困獸之鬥、尙有一般從業者，捨此別無他圖，故仍在隨各貨爲　退，丙種開價即高，旋見囘低，後因補空稍多，價再上升，至中午價比隔日好起，餘如甲乙丁戊俱　帶堅。</p>
<p>棉紗　市仍清淡，僅有二十支雙馬銀行單　開，川喊價愈高，又將衝破一重大關。</p>
<p>棉布　行市仍在停頓中，但因客方頗有實銷，進胃甚濃，故價橫跳　漲，龍頭細布初開時喊價尙在關內，至午刻竟衝出大關頗遠，重創新紀錄，四君子嗶　較昨亦軋高甚且，桃花女士林，白貓花布，三羊嗶　等，無不較昨一致軋高。</p>
<p>北貨　邇來銷路不孤兼以匯水高漲，貨主　意均堅，市勢一致向上，其中以木耳漲風允厲，已越數重大關，其餘亦激漲達百分之四五十云。</p>

<p>本市錢業同業公會，遵照工商同業法規，定期於本月二十四日召集全體會員大會，改組爲理監制度，選舉理事監事，俾推進會務，整頓業規云。</p>
<p>本市橡膠車胎號同業，以統一組織殊爲必要。乃由李砥柱，沈昆泉，曹德明，等發起組織同業公會，作爲橡膠業同業聯合會之一員，月　上文實業部工商同業公會整理委員會請求核准，現市經濟局接奉實業部令，以該會組織與工商公會暫行條例尙無不合，准許設立，並指定李砥柱爲召集人，積極籌備。</p>

<h3>把握今日</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>「今日事今日畢」，這是一句至理的名言。因爲在許多的日子中，「今日」是波偉大的日子。許多的發明家，思想家，發現家……都把他們偉大的工作貢獻給「今日」。</p>
<p>但是，「明日」却不偉大了。爲什麼呢？因爲想「明日」的人，往往忽略了「今日」，因此，「明日」永遠是不會完的了。</p>
<p>記得幼年時，我讀過一首明日　，其中有幾句道：</p>
<p>「明日復明日，明日何其多，我生待明日，萬事成蹉跎。」可見「明日」二字，耽擱了人的前途。</p>
<p>我們要認識「今日」是偉大的，「今日」是真實的。只有「今日」是存在的。「明日」，只是驕人的東西，因爲「明日」是空虛的，不可以捉摸的。所以，等待「明日」永遠不會完，也永遠不會有成功的一天。只有握住現實，抱定了「做一天乾一天的宗旨」，那才是前進的，成功的人所應爲。</p>
<h3>從日本歸來　（一）</h3>
<p>— 盛毓度</p>
<p>（筆者於上月渡日，歷時半月，謹就短時期內觀感所及，約略述之，以供讀者參考。）</p>
<p>南京旅館生活</p>
<p>到達東京第一日，　在下午六點鍾，已無法獲致晚餐。因規定自五時起，即開始進食·而餐館之供給量有限，顧客於四時起即排班鶻候，過時停止供給。余當日僅以隨身携帶之饼干充饥，终不得一噉飯所也，每人餐食，計早餐至多一元，午餐二元五解，晚餐五元，食品不　任意選擇，無論時間金錢，及食品種類，均有嚴格之限制，余平日頗喜水果，居留旅館中，僅每早　餐供給蘋果半支，初時頗感乏味，數日後亦即習慣食之彌甘，監知此項供給，尙只限於旅館生活有此享受，易地且不可或得，是非親歷其境者，不能知此中滋味。</p>
<p>物價統制成功</p>
<p>物價統制，頗爲成功，除米價較前稍稍提高外，其他物價，均視余一年半以前留日求學時，無甚變動，出租汽車，每次仍爲六角，冰淇淋，紅茶仍只一角一杯，　費仍爲一元五角至二元五角，電車自本年四月份起，始自七分改爲一角，此種成功，雖爲當局計划周密，行政努力之結果，而國民協助之精神，要爲一不可埋沒之最大因素。至於衣著方面，則採取普遍之分數配給制每人每年爲一百分，衣裝，皮鞋，領帶，帽子，襪子，襯衫等等均需憑分數票購置，用完一百分爲止。余在東京時，預算每日用費二十元，事實上有時實無須此數。</p>
<p>地盡力人盡才</p>
<p>官署園林昔栽花樹，今已開放種植蔬菜豛物，補足食品之不足，產量雖屬不足，然實歸地盤其利之義，有一分生產能力，即增一分實際用處，此種精神實足效法，全國學生制服之銅鈕及元助之銅象，皆在政府徴收之例，其利用物資有如此者。彼等曾發現婆羅門島美國空軍大半係學生充任，消息傳播，全國大學生爲之興奮，紛紛自動投效參加空軍訓練，其國民之愛國觀念，有如此者。</p>

<h3>雞</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>陶坤的妻，正對著黯淡燈光，呆坐著想得出神。她是不大知道世故人情的一個農家婦女，想不到爲了一支雞，丈夫平白地被人拘去，更不懂得爲什麼穿灰布衣的人，說我家裏有槍械？也不明白爲什麼要拿女兒秀寶的定親銀索子等等取去？還要拿僅有一張田單向人家押欽？可憐的簡單的腦海裏，那裏會體會出這複雜的一幕呢？驀然地小犬的吠聲，打破了她的迷糊不清的思路，莫不是阿坤回來了嗎？側著耳朵　聽，不多時腳步漸近，虛掩柴門，　的一聲推問了，進來的果然是自己的丈夫，何坤妻立刻站起來，露出內心歡喜的微笑，說道：</p>
<p>「你回來了！我等得疲乏了！秀寶的銀索子被穿灰布衣的拿去的，有帶回來嗎？我們一張田單被李鎮長拿去抵押款子的，你知道嗎？」阿坤妻子真是一個典型的農家婦說奾蠢，倒井不發，就是不懂複雜的世事罷了，還說出這樣的問話。</p>
<p>「什麼？田單拿去了，真是要我的命了？」阿坤突然營　沉　的　色，睜開眼向妻子瞪著，目不轉睛地半晌，又復哭喪著臉，低下頭來，數點淚珠。簌簌地滴下，異常的一誤切。</p>
<p>「去睡吧！已經半夜了，明天還答應河北沈家挖宅溝呢？」阿坤妻催著丈夫安息，過了一刻，阿坤才回到臥房妻倒頭便睡，可是反覆的回　着剛才的一幕，那裏能夠入夢？一壁廂聽聽妻及女兒秀寶，都呼呼地睡去了。</p>
<p>東方魚肚白的天光，漸漸地透明了，旭日也慢慢地升起來了。阿坤未曾聦過，頭腦暈眩，起來挾了一條凳子，往門外塲地上坐著，微黑的早晨，空氣異常清新，南岸行人道上，正疏疏落落的一個個張下人往鎮上去趕市集。（十二）</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange Resumption Issues</h3>
<p>The role of the securities market is to enable capital holders to find proper investment avenues and choose their desired investment targets, while those seeking capital can quickly raise the funds they need. Therefore, securities play a particularly important role in promoting enterprise development. Economist Yang Yinpu, in his book "On Chinese Exchanges," discussed the role of the securities market in promoting enterprise development, saying:</p>
<p>"If stocks cannot circulate in the market, raising capital will be difficult, and the organization of joint-stock companies will not be fully developed. Investors and merchants value the ability of capital to circulate, and are unwilling to purchase illiquid stocks with liquid funds. With the establishment of stock exchanges, stocks have a mechanism for circulation, and stock companies can develop accordingly. Furthermore, with the existence of markets for trading securities, the issuance of bonds becomes easier to circulate, making it easier to raise capital for enterprises, and promoting enterprise development."</p>
<p>If we compare the development of joint-stock companies in advanced industrialized countries with Yang's words, we realize that if any country wants to develop large-scale modern industries, it must first start with establishing a capital market—a securities market. Otherwise, large amounts of capital cannot be raised, and the only option is to utilize foreign capital. Yang's words focus only on industry, which is too narrow. In fact, there are many precedents for agricultural development and municipal construction relying on the assistance of securities markets. For example, long-term agricultural loans in Germany, which are substantial and have greatly benefited agricultural development, are due to the fact that agricultural bonds issued by agricultural financial institutions can circulate in the securities market. Our country's agriculture and industry are both extremely backward. Expanding and developing them depends on the ability to circulate large amounts of capital. Without quickly restoring the investment market, we feel it is impossible to raise funds. To curb speculation and guide idle capital into productive avenues, we must rely on the investment market. Therefore, we feel an urgent need for the resumption of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was established in 1920 and was suspended only after the Sino-Japanese Incident. Recently, it was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prepare for resumption. In the past, securities trading was limited to the buying and selling of government bonds, so its contribution to the industrial sector was minimal. In the future, to meet the needs of the times, it should take increasing the circulation of various production securities as its greatest responsibility after resumption. As for how to prevent speculation, stabilize prices, and strictly review listed securities, all of these are related to the stability of social finance. The exchange should pay special attention to research at the beginning of its resumption. The greatest purpose of restoring the securities market is to bring securities trading onto the right track, to assist the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry. Therefore, the exchange's future work should always be guided by this principle.</p>
<p>The exchange system differs between Britain and the United States and the mainland. Britain and the United States adopt a laissez-faire approach, while the mainland adopts an interventionist approach. Our country has always adopted the mainland system. In this era of social and economic instability, people's minds are largely inclined towards speculation. It may be impossible to completely prevent securities trading from becoming a target of speculation. We can only hope that the government will be more stringent in its supervision, such as prohibiting futures trading, restricting banks from using stocks as collateral for loans, and levying a small securities transaction tax. These are all remedial measures to prevent excessive speculation.</p>
<p>What the Exchange's Board of Directors should earnestly implement is that listed stocks must undergo strict scrutiny, absolutely without any emotional involvement or being controlled by any force. It should also strictly stipulate qualification standards, so that those performing the review have no difficulty in complying and no room for compromise. What should be particularly emphasized is that all listed securities must be for projects related to the wartime national economy. Otherwise, no matter how sound their credit, how long their history, or how perfect their management, they should not be allowed to be listed, so that social capital can be fully utilized for wartime economic needs.</p>
<p>Recently, stock prices have repeatedly risen, which is indeed affected by the rise in prices, but there is also a strong suspicion that stock firms can manipulate prices by buying and selling on their own account. After the exchange resumes operations, whether the brokers' own buying and selling will be absolutely prohibited, restricted, or allowed freely should be studied and decided before the exchange resumes operations.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a suggestion for the exchange. In the past, the ten Japanese securities exchanges were merged and reorganized by the Japanese government to suit the needs of the times. All its measures strive to suit the spirit of the times, and it is worthwhile to refer to them for reference.</p>
<p>Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>Subtle US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>In a special communiqué on June 22, the anniversary of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet authorities demanded that Britain and the United States immediately open a second front.</p>
<p>Stalin did not use euphemistic language, but directly and frankly提出the request to launch a second front. Britain and the United States themselves also know that with the imminent arrival of the decisive moment in the world war, they can no longer use that set of abstract reveries. Now they must show how to get Soviet approval. Stanley, the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, who previously criticized the Soviet Union for "ingratitude" and caused problems, recently uttered flattering words about the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>"The friendly relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now reaching their peak. This situation must be maintained in the future."</p>
<p>On the one hand, Roosevelt is currently asking the US Senate to remove anti-Soviet elements from the US diplomatic ranks. He is requesting the dismissal of Loy Henderson, the head of the State Department's Soviet Affairs Division, on the grounds that he has caused suspicion between the US and the Soviet Union. Washington newspapers praised Roosevelt for "using an extremely sincere attitude to seek closer US-Soviet understanding." Roosevelt's measures and Stanley's statement are all in the spirit of flattery and perfunctory treatment of the Soviet Union. Other than that, as for truly preparing or considering how to open a second front, it has not been considered at all, only taking a wait-and-see attitude and watching the Soviet Union's struggle. It is said that Henderson's departure from the State Department to take up the post of the new ambassador to Iraq is because he is particularly seriously concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude towards West Asia and the situation in the Caucasus. From this, we can see the shrewd attempt of the United States to combine flattery and surveillance. When the Eastern Front is delicate, US-Soviet relations still strongly feel a state of entanglement. (Wing: Translated from the June 29th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>New Georgia Island: Japanese Army Achieves Great Victory; Twenty Small Boats Sunk; Enemy Landing Attempt Fails</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 15th: (1) On the 14th, the Japanese garrison on New Georgia Island engaged the American troops who landed from the direction of Rubiana towards the eastern side of Munda, sinking twenty enemy boats, and the remaining troops were completely repelled. (2) A portion of the American troops who had advanced into the eastern area of Munda, echoing the former, came to attack, but were repelled by the Japanese garrison.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to seize Munda on New Georgia Island, the Japanese army's forward base, the enemy army displayed its ambition to advance its base forward and landed on Rentebua Island on June 30th. At the same time, it made its units land on Rice Bay on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island and on the southeast coast, showing a situation of capturing Munda. Since then, fierce battles have been launched in the sea, land, and air forces day and night in that area. The enemy forces advancing to Rubiana Island, three kilometers south of Munda, also echoed the enemy forces on the northwest, east, and west coasts of New Georgia Island, attempting to land from the eastern side of Munda. Starting at 8:00 AM on the 14th, they released a large smokescreen and began landing at 9:00 AM. The enemy used a total of 70 landing boats, half of which carried soldiers and the other half were full of military supplies. The Japanese coastal garrison immediately approached these enemy forces, and immediately launched a counterattack, bombarding them fiercely. At the same time, the rear immediately launched an attack, and the seaside area on the east side of Munda instantly turned into a fierce battlefield. The enemy's landing boats were hit by Japanese heavy shells and were in a state of panic. Twenty boats were sunk by the Japanese, and the rest were in a state of chaos, fleeing in a panic. Before the enemy's landing was completed and completely defeated, not a single enemy soldier was able to land , and they were defeated and fled. The total damage to the enemy's soldiers in this battle was confirmed to be 1,200 to 1,300. On the other hand, the enemy forces who landed on the southeast coast of New Georgia Island and attempted to peek at Munda, although they attacked from the right bank of (Sagami), were bravely intercepted by the Japanese army units, suffered heavy losses, and retreated. Although the enemy's counterattack in the South Pacific is still continuing, the foundation of the Japanese army's certain victory strategy has not been shaken. Moreover, thanks to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. Since June 30th, a total of 31 enemy boats and ships have been sunk, and many boats have been shot down, and more than 200 enemy aircraft have been shot down. The enemy's personnel losses have also reached tens of thousands.</p>
<h3>Japanese Central Cooperation Council: Second Day of Meeting; Four Committees Separately Discuss Important Cases; Prime Minister Explains Establishing a Decisive Battle Life</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency: When Japanese Prime Minister Tojo attended the fourth committee of the Central Cooperation Council on the 15th, after requesting to speak, he stood up to explain the lives of the Japanese people, and solemnly stated that in addition to ensuring their own lives, the Japanese people must always keep in mind the need to ensure the lives of one billion people in Greater East Asia. The gist of it was: Ensuring the lives of one hundred million Japanese people today should be handled with full responsibility, and we will work together with everyone to do so. However, in order to achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, in other words, in order to enable the countries and peoples within the Greater East Asia region to obtain their respective positions, it is necessary to further ensure the lives of thirty billion people living in this Greater East Asia region. We hope that you will understand this point. When operating this daily life, Japan itself is naturally a very large object, but on the one hand, it must always regard one billion people as the object.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Central Cooperation Council continued its second day of meetings on the 15th. From 8:00 AM, the four committees of the First Decisive Battle Spirit, the Second Strengthening Production of War Power, the Third Domestic Self-Sufficiency of Food, and the Fourth Decisive Battle Life held separate meetings at the same time to discuss all the proposals submitted by the members. Under the leadership of the chairmen of each committee, deliberations were conducted in the form of free discussion. On that day, Prime Minister Tojo first attended the fourth committee to listen to 국민대표 Deng's experience in establishing a decisive battle life. More than 100 people, including Internal Affairs Minister Ando, ​​Undersecretaries of the Ministry of Public Welfare, and bureau chiefs and section chiefs of the Cabinet ministries, attended each committee separately. This is enough to show the enthusiasm of the Japanese government, and to answer the questions of the members. Officials and civilians worked together to discuss a winning plan, and fully demonstrated the spirit of the Central Cooperation Council. The proposals discussed that day were: the first committee focused on ideological decisive battle and cooperation between officials and civilians, and 국민지도위원 focused on enterprise consolidation and labor in the mining and industrial industries; the third committee focused on guiding the provision of public rice and 仛production; and the fourth committee focused on ensuring the supply of essential goods and materials in the war life and on savings and air defense. All committees deliberated all day without resting and adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Yesterday Visited the Chairman</h3>

<h3>Colonel Kurihara Succeeds: Japanese Navy Press Section Chief; Hiraide Transferred to Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on the 15th: Colonel Hideo Hiraide, Chief of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, succeeded as Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau. The vacancy of the Chief of the Press Section was filled by Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara. According to reports, Colonel Hiraide returned to Japan from Italy in July 1940 and immediately served as the Director of the Press Department of the General Headquarters. For three years, he was active on the front line of the press battle and made great contributions. Recently, due to poor health and having served for a long time, he was replaced by Colonel Kurihara. Colonel Kurihara learned about the current state of the war at the decisive stage in the military in the past, and his appointment as Chief of the Press Section is the most suitable person. In the future, Colonel Kurihara will launch a decisive battle in the propaganda war against Britain and the United States. Colonel Kurihara graduated from the Naval Academy in November 1929. He served as the deputy artillery chief of the Haruna warship. In November 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In December 1936, he served as a member of the Military Affairs Bureau. In November 1937, he became a member of the Naval Press Department of the General Headquarters. After being promoted to colonel in 1939, he successively served as the staff officer of the Shanghai area base team. In December of the same year, he served as a staff officer of the Sasebo Naval Base. In November 1940, he entered the Military Affairs Bureau, and later served as the Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau until now.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara Expresses His Aspirations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, who succeeded Colonel Honde as Chief of the Naval Press Department, met with a group of reporters from the Navy Ministry on the 15th and explained his aspirations for his new position. The gist of it was: I am deeply aware of the importance of the mission of the press in the decisive battle, and I feel a great responsibility. I am a layman when it comes to press propaganda work. Colonel Hiraide made great contributions during his tenure, and I cannot but do my best to succeed him. The current war situation is precisely the decisive battle situation, and the enemy's counterattack operations are now becoming more and more intense. However, I believe that making the most of the nation's overall strength is the most urgent task today. Therefore, the one hundred million Japanese people hope and are determined to do their best to contribute to the war. The people across the country are fighting as production soldiers, so it is especially important to remember this determination, which is directly related to the Solomon Islands. Regarding the ideological war, contributing all existing forces to the country and fully exerting its power is the driving force for victory. It is also necessary to improve the "paper is weak" hit rate, so that every bullet hits its mark, and I hope that we can recognize the target to be fired at and make every shot count.</p>

<h3>Japanese Economic Mission Completes Inspection Mission; Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Becomes Closer</h3>

The results of the trip can be summarized as follows: (1) The Chinese side has unlimited expectations and ardent hopes for the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and the concept of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

<h3>New China's Economic Construction Policy: Minister Chen Junhui's Remarks to Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>Chen Junhui, Minister of Construction of the National Government and Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, went to Japan to inspect the construction situation in wartime Japan. He met with Japanese reporters at the Imperial Hotel at 5:00 PM on the 9th and spoke as follows:</p>
<p>(Q) What is the new China's construction policy after the establishment of the Ministry of Construction of the National Government, especially the three-year economic construction plan and its progress?</p>
<p>(A) The Ministry of Construction was established in February of this year and has only been in existence for a few months. The ministry merged the original Ministry of Transportation and the Water Conservancy Commission, and its undertakings are also inherited from previous work. Since the three-year economic construction plan was passed, it has focused on the plan and made every effort to actively carry out construction. The focus is on the water conservancy problem of farmland.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the economic trend in China after the implementation of the new policies? That is, (A) What is the situation after the restriction on the movement of materials and the actual situation of material circulation? (B) What is the current situation of the national commercial control federation's autonomous control?</p>
<p>(A) Since the implementation of the new policies, the supply and purchase relationship of materials has been greatly improved. All of these are controlled under the new organization of the National Commercial Control Federation. Its lower-level organizations include the board of directors and trade associations, and its activities have also been greatly promoted. The mechanism for making the movement of materials smooth has gradually been completed. In particular, the purchasing of materials is carried out by the joint committee, trade associations, and localities maintaining close relations. Although it cannot be said to be sufficient, the main institutions have been completed by the end of June.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the future activity method of the National Economic Commission?</p>
<p>(A) The commission was reorganized in February of this year. In addition to officials and civilians, it also brought together many influential figures from the private financial and business circles. Although the commission is not an executive body, it is the highest deliberative body of the government. Now it has also established a research institute to unify the original government and private investigation agencies and provide data for the National Economic Commission for deliberation.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the status of the East Taihu development project in the three-year plan?</p>
<p>(A) The development of East Taihu started with the technical guidance of Japan. In an area of approximately 1.6 million hectares of farmland, 700,000 dan of rice can be harvested. In addition, development projects are being carried out along the Yangzi River delta area.</p>
<p>The purpose of this visit to Japan is to inspect the general situation of wartime construction in Japan and to hold talks with influential people in the government and the public. I hope that the National Government and China will continue to receive maximum assistance. China will work with Japan to move towards the completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War. (Xiang: Translated from the July 11th Tokyo dispatch of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Turkish-Syrian Border to Be Closed Again</h3>
<p>Svanburg, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters reports that it was learned here last night that the border between Turkey and Syria will be closed again today or tomorrow. The reason for this action has not been announced.</p>
<h3>Chile and Paraguay Sign Treaty of Friendship</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Chilean capital: During Paraguayan President Morinigo's visit to Santiago, the foreign ministers of Chile and Paraguay signed a treaty of peace and friendship between the two countries.

<h3>Axis Forces in Sicily Prepare for General Counter-Offensive; British Paratroopers Annihilated in Catania; American Forces Suffer Setbacks Around Gela</h3>
<p>Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Axis forces in Sicily have completed preparations for a counter-offensive, and the military situation on the island seems to be approaching a decisive turning point. It is reported that fierce fighting is currently taking place east of Gela. The elite Goering Division is attacking the American Seventh Army, and British and Canadian allied forces are engaged in fierce fighting with German and Italian troops near Floridia. Military analysts in London believe that the Axis forces will launch a counter-offensive from the north against the British Eighth Army. It is reported that Anglo-American aerial reconnaissance has discovered numerous Axis armored columns moving from Paterno towards Catania. The plain of Catania is considered the most ideal battlefield for tank warfare. At the same time, according to news from Berlin: Even before the general counter-offensive by the Axis forces, Anglo-American forces will be forced to remain on the defensive, as they need to await sufficient reinforcements and supplies. Currently, the land battles in Sicily involve American forces attempting to expand their established bridgehead, while German and Italian advance units are strengthening their resistance, preventing Anglo-American landing forces from breaking through to the mountainous interior of the island. The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa announced: The most intense fighting on the island is currently concentrated around Gela, where American forces have suffered significant setbacks. According to the latest news: Axis armored forces have launched a fierce attack on the right flank of the anti-Axis forces, targeting the British Eighth Army in Catania and the American forces in Licata on its right flank. From the current observations, it can be concluded that it will be difficult for the two anti-Axis forces to continue to advance, as the Axis armored forces are now in a favorable position to repel the advancing units.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - On Tuesday night, a group of British paratroopers, about a company in strength, landed on the Catania plain and were annihilated by German forces. The British had planned a surprise attack, but unexpectedly, the landing site was where the German forces were deployed. Within an hour of the start of the British paratroop landing, most were either killed or captured.</p>
<p>Southeast Coast, Battle Rages</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Reuters military correspondent reports: The fighting in southeastern Sicily has developed into a large-scale battle, as Anglo-American forces, having received a steady stream of reinforcements, have resumed their attempts to invade the interior. The Anglo-American air forces have been very effective in assisting the operations in the aforementioned battles. At the same time, the Axis forces are putting up very strong resistance, unwilling to give up an inch of ground easily, causing very heavy losses to the Anglo-American forces. Yesterday, an Italian communiqué announced that the Anglo-American forces have opened up roads to the southeastern mountainous areas of Sicily and the Catania plain. This can be considered the largest territorial gain for the anti-Axis forces at the extreme point in southeastern Sicily. From the defenders' point of view, this area has always been considered vulnerable. Based on the current situation, it appears that the British Eighth Army and the American Seventh Army have established contact in the area. It should be noted that the anti-Axis forces have been striving for this kind of linkup since the initial days of the battle. The main pressure of the Axis offensive is now concentrated in the area north and northwest of Augusta. The tank units of the Hermann Goering Division in that area are intensifying their pressure towards Catania with the assistance of the Luftwaffe. Catania, the second largest city in Sicily, is clearly the target of the British advance. If the Anglo-American forces can complete their operational plan to occupy the entire east coast of the island up to Messina, it would be tantamount to severing all communication between the island and the great traitor of Italy. However, it can be asserted that the Axis command has already made proper preparations for the necessary resistance measures.</p>
<p>Italian Military Releases Details of Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military authorities announced at 1:00 PM on the 15th: On the Sicilian front, from the Gulf of Licata in the west to the Gulf of Augusta in the east, and in the mountainous areas on the east coast and the Catania plain, anti-Axis forces appear to have landed reinforcements since the 12th, unfolding fierce fighting along the entire 150-kilometer front. Although the connection between the eastern and western flanks of the anti-Axis forces has not yet been successful, the German authorities recently acknowledged that the British Eighth Army and the American Seventh Army have successfully linked up in southeastern Sicily near Ragusa and Modica. Moreover, with the support of reinforcements, the anti-Axis forces centered on the ports of Licata and Gela appear to have advanced slightly to the east and north. Currently, the primary objective of the anti-Axis war is to occupy the Catania plain, and they appear to be attempting to gradually advance from Augusta under the cover of naval gunfire from the fleet on the east coast.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for British and American Ships</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - On Tuesday afternoon, Axis air forces sank four anti-Axis landing ships full of troops and military supplies, two large transport ships carrying ammunition, and one supply ship of over 3,000 tons. In addition, one cruiser and three cargo ships, totaling 14,000 tons, were severely damaged. Between July 10th and 13th, the German air force sank or destroyed a total of 34 anti-Axis ships, totaling approximately 160,000 tons. Many of the damaged ships are too badly damaged to be repaired. In addition, one British battleship, three cruisers, and one destroyer were also directly hit by bombs.</p>
<h3>Southern Italian Cities Declared War Zones</h3>

<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency, London reports that after General Sikorski died in a plane crash in Gibraltar, Mikolajczyk has succeeded as Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile.

Jan Szyroki, the Polish Minister to Egypt, has been appointed Foreign Minister. Well-informed sources in London say that the British government opposed Sosnkowski's appointment as Minister of Defense because his attitude is not conducive to resolving the dispute between Poland and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Vichy France Severs Diplomatic Relations with Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to information from Chongqing, French Ambassador to Chongqing, Penquer, and all the staff of the embassy have been ordered by their government to leave Chongqing. Because the Vichy government, adapting to the new situation in East Asia, recently implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights to the National Government, Chongqing has repeatedly protested to Vichy and moved its diplomatic mission to Vichy to Lisbon. In fact, diplomatic relations between Chongqing and Vichy have already been severed.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Quiet</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency: For several days, the fighting on the Eastern Front has been quiet, except in the areas of Orel and Belgorod.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced on the 14th that Soviet forces in the Belgorod area have suffered heavy losses. In addition, Soviet forces launched fierce attacks east and north of Orel with reinforcements, and German forces counterattacked with reserve troops.

Powerful units of the German Air Force have participated in the fighting on the Eastern Front, destroying numerous Soviet tanks and shooting down 212 Soviet aircraft.</p>
<h3>French National Day Air Raid on Paris</h3>

He has now been moved to South Africa for treatment at the urgent request of doctors.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General in Hankou Discusses the Return of the Shanghai Concession</h3>
<p>Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, a reporter from the Wuhan Central Branch recently interviewed Mr. Takatsu, the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou, to inquire about his views. He stated that less than a month after the signing of the Sino-Japanese treaty, the International Settlement will be returned on August 1st, which is a memorable page in the recovery of Chinese sovereignty. The Shanghai International Settlement was the origin of American and British aggression against China, so its return was extremely difficult. Now, due to China's participation in the war and active promotion of war policies, China has been able to realize its century-old dream. The return of the International Settlement will enable the National Government to fully exert its governance, which will have a significant impact on politics, economy, and culture. From this, the strengthening and revival of the National Government can be seen.</p>
<h3>North China Launches the "Support the New Asia Movement"</h3>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of the North China Support the New Asia Movement Headquarters was held at the New Asia Public Hall in the Dongcheng District of Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 8th. President, Minister Kanzawa, and Vice President of the North China Development Company, Mr. Shanxi, and other staff members attended the meeting on time. Guests included Mr. Shimazu, representative of the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Mihara, head of the Training Section of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and Mr. Nishimura, representative of the commander of the Okochi Unit of the North China Army. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the New People's Society, Zhang Zhongzhi, Director of Political Affairs, Yu Xijie, Deputy Chairman of the New People's Society, and directors of the local Support the New Asia Movement offices, attended, numbering about 100. After a formal ceremony, the meeting began with Mr. Shanxi, Vice President of the Development Company, as chairman. Mr. Mihara, Head of the Training Section of the Beijing Embassy, explained the guiding principles of the North China Support the New Asia Movement and the regulations of the North China Support the New Asia Movement Headquarters, which were unanimously approved. President Kanzawa then appointed the staff and explained the budget, which was put to a vote, and the agenda was concluded. Subsequently, President Kanzawa, Mr. Shimazu, representative of the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Nishimura, representative of the Commander Okochi, and Chairman Wang Kemin delivered speeches and congratulations. A congratulatory telegram from Prime Minister Tojo, the President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, was read. Finally, Vice President Shanxi delivered a speech. After about two hours, this deeply meaningful inauguration meeting concluded, and the North China Support the New Asia Movement Headquarters, the core of the 400,000 Japanese in North China, and the supreme guidance body for cooperation between officials and civilians, officially began its work. After the inauguration meeting, after a short break, a joint meeting of the headquarters staff, local Support the New Asia Movement officers, and office directors was held to exchange views on the Support the New Asia Movement. The meeting adjourned after 6 PM. The main points of President Kanzawa's speech at the inauguration meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>In response to the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement that began in Japan in Showa 15 (1940), the Japanese in North China also launched a Support the New Asia Movement. However, until now, there has been no consistent and organic organization. Not only that, they have neglected the fact that they live among the Chinese and Chinese people, and they do not think about having common goals and ideals with China. Therefore, in response to this shift in Japan's policy towards China, we want to further develop the industrialization movement. Needless to say, Japan's noble founding spirit of Hakkō ichiu is also the common ideal of building a new order in Greater East Asia. This common and highest goal is the New Asia ideal, and its realization is the substance of the New Asia Movement. Especially in North China, which has a very close relationship with Japan, the Japanese here must work together towards the common ideal goals of China and Japan to demonstrate a model area for the new order in Greater East Asia. North China is the cultivation base where the New Asia Movement should first be realized. The reason why we are now forming a strong, unified organization with the cooperation of government and people to actively carry out the Support the New Asia Movement lies in this. It is hoped that the 400,000 Japanese residents in North China, through this strong organization, will maintain a stable mind, internally support the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement in Japan, and externally cooperate with the New Asia Movement in China, practice Japan's noble and far-reaching founding spirit, and cooperate in the development of North China.

<h3>Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno from the Japanese Publishing Industry Arrive in Shanghai - Our Newspaper Hosted a Tea Party Yesterday - More Than Twenty Representatives from Various Newspapers Attended, Creating a Very Enthusiastic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Mr. Ken Yamada, Managing Director of the major Japanese publishing company Greater East Asia Publishing Co., and Mr. Takashi Ueno, Director of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute, came to Shanghai together on [date] to research the cultural publishing industries in various parts of Greater East Asia and to establish a foundation for cultural publishing within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They plan to visit relevant organizations and groups in the city and exchange views with cultural figures in the water city. Therefore, our newspaper initiated a reception yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association hall in the Xingya Building to introduce Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno to members of the press in the city. In addition to the two gentlemen, Mr. Hiroshi Hata, Director of the China Cultural Economics Research Institute, and more than twenty representatives from the Press Association and various newspapers also attended. The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>President Chen's Impromptu Speech</p>
<p>First, President Chen of our newspaper gave an impromptu speech, stating that he was very pleased to introduce Mr. Yamada of the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and Mr. Ueno of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute to colleagues in Shanghai's cultural circles on the occasion of their visit to Shanghai. He was also grateful for the presence of Mr. Hiroshi Hata, a senior figure in the cultural circles of a friendly nation. The Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute are dedicated to researching the cultural publishing industry in Greater East Asia, so their relationship with China is extremely close. We are eager to learn from them and to engage in sincere discussions and research to truly achieve the goal of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Ueno Introduces Publishing</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Ueno introduced Japan's publishing industry, saying: There are about 3,000 kinds of publications in Japan, of which about 1,000 are government publications and 1,000 to 2,000 are privately operated, but only 400 to 500 of them have a good reputation. Therefore, it is felt that there is not enough strength to promote cultural education and other work in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For this reason, the major figures in Japan's cultural publishing industry have formed the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute to promote cultural publishing in Greater East Asia and lay a new foundation for it. Cultural construction in Greater East Asia is most important in mainland China, so we have decided to re-study Chinese culture, but this is still a preliminary stage, and we hope that everyone will give us guidance and cooperation. In the past, Japan has done a lot of research on Chinese cultural publishing and economic issues, but without special achievements. The biggest reason is that it focused too much on form and lacked practicality, and its understanding of China's real situation was too shallow, so there were few satisfactory results. In the future, we hope to be able to match our words with our actions to complete our mission of cultural research.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamada Expresses His Views</p>
<p>Mr. Yamada then expressed his views, saying: I am really an "outsider" to your country's news industry and rarely study it. However, what we know is that the Shanghai press and publishing industries bear a very important mission, and we are sure that you will be able to accomplish it through your efforts. As for our views on Japanese publications, as Mr. Ueno said, although there are many publications, how many of them can become famous? The reason why it is not easy to improve is probably because they are not practical. We should study where the crux of the problem lies and improve it, and at the same time, we hope that you will give us as much criticism as possible, and we are very willing to accept it.</p>
<p>Holding Cordial Discussions and Dispersing Happily</p>
<p>Then, the cordial discussions began. Mr. Yamada, Mr. Hata, and others provided practical answers to the opinions raised by Mr. Weng Yongqing, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan, and others. It was said that Japan has indeed implemented newspaper mergers, but magazine mergers are also gradually being implemented. However, because famous magazines sold in China still maintain their original status, many Chinese people cannot understand this matter. In fact, most Japanese magazines have already been merged. Regarding Japanese newspapers' coverage of news about China, the amount is a little less than that of Chinese newspapers' coverage of news about Japan. According to Mr. Hata, because the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage, all newspapers are focusing on war news, and because of limited space, this phenomenon may occur. However, in the past, the coverage of Chinese news in various newspapers was no less than that in Chinese newspapers. According to Mr. Hata, students in Japanese schools and villages are already learning Chinese and Chinese, and are abandoning British and American English, so they will definitely make more contributions to Sino-Japanese culture in the future. According to the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute, which were established this spring, it is purely a non-governmental organization engaged in the research of cultural publishing. In addition to publishing various war pictorials to introduce the real situation of Japan to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and various parts of Southeast Asia, it will also prepare to publish Chinese, Burmese, and Southeast Asian books, and will focus entirely on literary and academic works. When necessary, it will decide to translate famous Chinese and Japanese books and introduce them to the people of the two countries, and invite Chinese people to write articles to realize Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. It is said that the company's headquarters is in Tokyo, and in order to strengthen its work in the future, it may set up a branch in Shanghai. Finally, Ren Yunpeng of the Press Association introduced the general situation and current status of the Shanghai Press Association to the two gentlemen in detail, and the gathering ended happily at about 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Mission Returns to Shanghai from Inspection in Beijing - Revitalization Company Hosts a Banquet for Cordial Discussions</h3>

<h3>Citizens' Welfare Association Holds Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association held its fifth board meeting at the City General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. All directors, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhuang Yun, and Zhang Yunbo, attended. First, the chairman reported on the association's affairs.

<h3>Various Circles Sponsor Shen Bao's Education Assistance Program and Hope to Stabilize Teachers' Lives - Education Authorities Are Planning to Increase Salaries</h3>
<p>Since our newspaper launched the education assistance program, we have been gratified by the enthusiastic support from all walks of life, who have joined us in this good cause. The letters received yesterday are recorded below: Mr. Zhu Minghe generously donated 1,000 yuan and expressed his opinion that the current teachers are unable to make ends meet due to insufficient income, and many have changed careers or taken on part-time jobs, resulting in a reduction in school courses, which greatly affects students' education. He hopes that our newspaper will establish a teacher assistance fund in addition to the education assistance fund to stabilize teachers' lives so that they no longer have to seek ways to support themselves, and he hopes that people from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically. It is reported that the education authorities have held meetings and decided to find ways to increase teachers' salaries and discuss preferential treatment measures. Mr. Pei Zhengyong not only donated 500 yuan himself, but also raised 1,000 yuan from Pudong Bank. Mr. Pan Jiyan allocated 500 yuan from his salary to donate, and said that he will continue to donate as much as he can in the future.</p>

<h3>In the Voice of Unified Promotion of Charity - A Visit to the Poverty and Disease Relief Association (II) - Why Not Run Your Own Business?</h3>
<p>Why only focus on supporting established charities and not run your own charitable business? This is a very interesting but very important question. The person in charge of the association pointed out: This question also contains two questions: First, why are there so many charitable organizations, but in fact Shanghai is still full of sufferers awaiting relief? Second, should we start from scratch and create a large-scale charity to run all charitable undertakings? The founders of the association have carefully studied these two questions. Their conclusion is that: First, the reason why existing charitable organizations cannot fully protect Shanghai's suffering compatriots is mainly due to the unfavorable objective environment, which naturally involves political, economic, and cultural factors, which will not be discussed for the time being. The secondary reason is due to the subjective shortcomings of the charitable organizations, namely (1) insufficient funding, (2) improper planning, and (3) ineffective management. Objective reasons require efforts from other parties, and we can remedy and improve subjective reasons. The Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association's focus on supporting established charitable organizations to promote charitable undertakings is based on this first reason. Second, why not run your own charitable business? Indeed, general psychology seems to suggest that running your own business may result in better fundraising results. However, will it be effective for charitable undertakings? This is a very big question: Because (1) in terms of material facilities, the houses, real estate, and internal equipment of the existing charitable organizations in Shanghai are so large that their assets are simply inestimable. Even with a large portion of the entire annual budget of the organizations, it is probably impossible to do it - for example, the foundations of the Xujiahui and Yangjingbang Saint Mary's Cathedral, the Tushanwan Orphanage, and the Puyutang were gradually accumulated over decades or even centuries, and it is definitely not something that a few people can prepare in a short period of time. (2) In terms of talent, the more than 330 charitable organizations in Shanghai each have their own specialized talent according to their respective business departments, from the heads of the various associations who have been painstakingly operating for decades, to the practical workers who work hard, are selfless, and sacrifice their service for decades, the philanthropy of Catholicism and Christianity, the compassion of Buddhism, and the respect for the elderly and the young in Confucianism, this spirit and the various service morals and skills of supporting the elderly, disabled, and educating orphans and poor children cannot be trained in any school. (3) In terms of the cause, each charity has achieved considerable results over decades or even centuries, and has long been praised by various parties at home and abroad, which is also something that any newly established organization cannot easily accomplish. The Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association's focus on guiding established organizations rather than running its own business is based on this second reason.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Continue to Arrive in Shanghai - The Next Ration May Be the Same as the Original Quantity</h3>
<p>Although the authorities have repeatedly emphasized that there is no shortage of food for the people in the city, and the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company also plans to find ways to transport rice from other places to Shanghai for relief, the people's concern about this issue has not diminished at all. This matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood and should not be ignored for a moment. Yesterday, a reporter from Shanghai News Agency asked informed sources about this issue. According to them, the authorities, feeling the people's high expectations for food, will clear up all parties' anxieties within the most appropriate period of time and make the food on which the livelihoods of 5 million people depend transparent, so that the source of rice and grain will not be cut off, and the phenomenon of temporary reduction of household rations can also be eliminated. The authorities know that in order to achieve this goal, first, it is necessary to promote the convenience of transportation, so that the grain in the producing areas can be transported to Shanghai for sale without delay; second, it is necessary to improve the purchase method, especially the purchase price, which should take into account the interests of farmers and set the most reasonable price standard according to their production costs, so that farmers will be willing to sell rice. In any case, at the time when the right to allocate food rice is transferred to the Chinese side, various unforeseen difficulties are inevitable, but for the sake of the people's livelihood, the people should do their best to prevent the black market for food rice, and the authorities and the agencies in charge of purchasing, transporting, and selling food rice should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the people's livelihood in order to achieve true stability.</p>
<p>Joint Venture Company Rice Already Available</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) All sectors are extremely concerned about the food rice issue in the city. The Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company has explored 200,000 dan of white rice from the Su, Yang, and Hu areas, which has been arriving in Shanghai continuously since the 10th. In the future, it can be imported to Shanghai in large quantities and the ration from the next period can be restored to the original quantity.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>On June 22, this column "Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks" stated that under the current environment, the resumption of the stock exchange will be an inevitable fact. As for its purpose, it was explained in three points; at that time, some people doubted whether the stock exchange could resume business at this time, but they did not know that it was precisely because of this time that it was necessary for the stock exchange to resume business. Now the facts tell us that the stock exchange has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 24th of this month and is scheduled to resume business in mid-August.</p>
<p>Why did the stock exchange resume business at this time? Eliminating the independent business behavior of stockbrokers, promoting the smooth turnover of the stock business, and guiding social idle funds into the production sector of national capital are all reasons, but the most important reason is that the Shanghai economy after the recovery of the concessions must be adjusted and unified, and no more chaotic economic behavior is allowed. In terms of institutions and personnel, a thorough adjustment and unification must be carried out, just as the Dalu News reported on July 3: "Shanghai is the economic heartland of China, and everything is of great importance; after the recovery of the concessions, we hope that special and prudent consideration and adjustment will be given to the candidates and institutions responsible for practical work." Indeed, it must be so. Only then can all economic behavior be unified to achieve a truly perfect state. Since the business behavior of stockbrokers uses the resumption of the stock exchange as its medium for adjustment and unification, other aspects of economic behavior, especially hoarding behavior, rely more on the establishment of "appropriate agencies" and the strengthening of their organizations.</p>
<h3>Eleven Banks and Brokers Have Increased Capital According to Law This Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Government, in order to reorganize the small banks and brokers in Shanghai and consolidate the foundation of financial institutions, promulgated the Bank Registration Regulations and the Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Amended Trust Companies, instructing the Shanghai Banking and Brokerage Association to inform all member banks and brokers to increase their capital in accordance with the new regulations and laws. It is learned that, in addition to the 13 banks that have increased capital separately before, more than 40 are in the process of increasing capital. From the 1st of this month to yesterday, the banks and brokers that have increased their original capital in accordance with the Amended Bank Registration Regulations include: Yida increased capital by 1.3 million yuan, Zhengtai increased capital by 1 million yuan, Yuanlai increased capital by 1.9225 million yuan, Jianyi increased capital by 1.15 million yuan, Tongsheng increased capital by 2 million yuan, Tianyi increased capital by 4.25 million yuan, Zhenghua increased capital by 2.5 million yuan, Xinfu increased capital by 1.5 million yuan, Shanghai Trust increased capital by 2 million yuan, Lihe Trust increased capital by 9 million yuan, and Taihe increased capital by 2 million yuan.

<h3>This Year's China Central Cotton Procurement Is Good</h3>
<p>This year's cotton procurement will be completed after tens of thousands of dan of cotton arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. Since the procurement authorities began purchasing in accordance with the China Central Cotton Control Order last November, the total amount obtained by the end of this month will be equal to that obtained last year. Cotton procurement is the first step in the procurement of essential agricultural materials. It is not easy to have such results. (July 15, Dalu News)</p>
<h3>Hankou Materials Control Branch Is Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th) The Wuhan Branch Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Materials Control Association is composed of six Chinese and six Japanese members. Since the beginning of active preparation, internal personnel matters have also been carefully assessed. The branch rules have been drafted by Li Dingan and four others, referring to the association's organizational regulations. Once a preparatory office is found, it will officially begin operations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks advanced rapidly first and then retreated sharply, with unpredictable movements and a trend similar to that of gold prices. Initially, they inherited the confusing upward momentum from the noon close of the previous day, but were then suppressed by those who sold at high prices. The confidence of people in all directions has been shaken, and the industry feels that the one-sided rise in stock prices is too great and is planning to curb it, and the volume of transactions has decreased. Nanyang Tobacco Company had a crazy change, and the result of the initial moment of the morning was the largest squeeze. After the Great China Match was taken out of the customs, it has been re-entered. The upward momentum of the Beishui Electric and Huashang Electric has slowed down. The department store Yong'an Company has also seen a similar decline. The rise of Xinxin and Guohuo companies is also strong. Nei Yi and Jing Lun, Jing Fu are both leaping. The textile industry has also risen in many ways. Yong'an Textile has also risen slowly. The Great China Weaving of small denomination has suddenly been bought by a certain household and suddenly raised. Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving. The new printing and dyeing has not yet stopped rising. In the cultural industry, the World Book Company has the largest squeeze, and the rise of Commercial Press and Zhonghua is relatively small. Xinyi of the new pharmaceutical industry is also rising differently, and Zhongfa and Xinya are also squeezing strongly. The China Clock Factory is in sight of a major checkpoint, and Gongxin Electric has transactions.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the gold and silver shops in the city, particularly the Shoushi Gold branch of Daxin, offered gold ornaments at the limited price with the same handling fee, but there were virtually no transactions. There was also a market with no sales outside the shops, and prices were chaotic. Initially, there was a gradual increase, approaching a significant level, but later, it exceeded the levels outside the Customs. By noon, it returned to the previous level. The price of silver also rose compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest: The call loan interest rate announced by the Bankers' Association remained unchanged at 24%.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, government bonds strengthened again. People seemed to be making a last-ditch effort, with some industry practitioners having no other options. Therefore, they were still following the ups and downs of various commodities. The initial asking price for Class C bonds was high, but then it dropped. Later, due to some short covering, the price rose again, and by noon, the price was better than the previous day. The other classes, such as A, B, D, and E, also showed signs of strengthening.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The market remained quiet, with only the "20 count Shuangma Bank single yarn" actively traded. The asking price from Sichuan continued to rise, and it was about to break through another major level.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The market was still stagnant, but due to strong actual sales from customers, the willingness to buy was high, causing prices to fluctuate wildly. The initial asking price for Longtou fine cloth was still within the Customs, but by noon, it had surged far beyond, setting a new record. Sijunzi drill was also significantly higher than yesterday. Taohua Nushilin, White Cat floral cloth, Sanyang drill, and others were all consistently higher than yesterday.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Recently, sales have been strong and exchange rates have soared. Sellers were firm in their intentions, and the market trend was consistently upward. Among them, the price of wood ear fungus rose sharply, surpassing several major levels. Other goods also saw price increases of 40-50%.</p>

<h3>Seize Today</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>"Do today's work today" is a truly wise saying. Because among many days, "today" is a great day. Many inventors, thinkers, and explorers... have contributed their great work to "today."</p>
<p>However, "tomorrow" is not great. Why? Because those who think about "tomorrow" often neglect "today." Therefore, "tomorrow" will never be completed.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, I read a poem about tomorrow, in which a few lines said:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are! I live waiting for tomorrow, and everything is delayed." It can be seen that the word "tomorrow" delays people's futures.</p>
<p>We must recognize that "today" is great, "today" is real. Only "today" exists. "Tomorrow" is just a tempting thing, because "tomorrow" is empty and cannot be grasped. Therefore, waiting for "tomorrow" will never end, and there will never be a day of success. Only by grasping reality and adhering to the principle of "doing one day's work in one day," can we move forward, which is what successful people should do.</p>
<h3>Returning from Japan (I)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Yudu</p>
<p>(The author traveled to Japan last month for half a month. I will briefly describe my observations during this short period for readers' reference.)</p>
<p>Life in a Nanjing Hotel</p>
<p>I arrived in Tokyo on the first day at 6:00 PM and was unable to get dinner. Because starting from 5:00 PM, dinner is served. However, the supply of restaurants is limited, and customers line up starting at 4:00 PM. Service stops after that. That day, I only ate the biscuits I had brought with me and couldn't get a meal. Each person's meal costs at most one yuan for breakfast, two and a half yuan for lunch, and five yuan for dinner. The food selection is not arbitrary. There are strict restrictions on time, money, and food types. I usually like fruit, but during my stay at the hotel, only half an apple was provided for breakfast. At first, I found it quite boring, but after a few days, I got used to it and found it delicious. I realized that this supply was only available in hotels. Elsewhere, it was not possible to obtain it. Those who have not experienced it firsthand cannot know the taste.</p>
<p>Successful Price Controls</p>
<p>Price controls have been quite successful. Except for the price of rice, which has increased slightly, other prices are not much different from when I studied in Japan one and a half years ago. Taxis still cost 60 sen per ride, and ice cream and black tea are still only 10 sen per cup. Haircuts still cost 1.5 to 2.5 yuan. Streetcar fares increased from 7 sen to 10 sen starting in April of this year. This success is the result of careful planning and diligent administration by the authorities, but the spirit of national cooperation is the most important factor that cannot be ignored. As for clothing, a universal point rationing system is adopted. Each person receives 100 points per year. Clothing, leather shoes, ties, hats, socks, shirts, etc., must be purchased with points. Once the 100 points are used up, no more can be purchased. When I was in Tokyo, I budgeted 20 yuan per day for expenses, but in reality, sometimes this amount was not needed.</p>
<p>Making the Most of Land and Talent</p>
<p>Government offices and gardens, which used to grow flowers and trees, are now open for planting vegetables and crops to supplement the food shortage. Although the output is insufficient, it is truly fulfilling the meaning of making the most of the land. If there is a one-point production capacity, it will increase one point of practical use. This spirit is truly worthy of emulation. The copper buttons on the uniforms of students across the country and the bronze statues originally donated are all subject to government requisition. This is how they utilize materials. They discovered that many of the American air force personnel on Brahman Island were students. When the news spread, university students across the country were excited and volunteered to join the air force training program. This is how patriotic their citizens are.</p>
<h3>To Night Travelers</h3>
<p>— Rong Ge</p>
<p>Night travelers in the dark night,</p>
<p>Let's muster our courage and grope forward!</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of the looming shadows,</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of the screeching owls,</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of the terror of walking in the dark.</p>
<p>Let's use our strong faith</p>
<p>To overcome all difficulties!</p>
<p>Night travelers in the dark night,</p>
<p>Let's muster our courage and grope forward!</p>
<p>Don't sigh that the stars are gone,</p>
<p>The light of faith, ah,</p>
<p>Will always guide us forward!</p>
<p>Night travelers in the silent night!</p>
<p>Let's muster our courage and grope forward!</p>
<p>Don't be discouraged</p>
<p>Don't be pessimistic</p>
<p>Isn't dawn coming after the long night?</p>

<p>The dark night is almost over,</p>
<p>And the light is beckoning us ahead.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Tao Kun's wife was staring blankly at the dim light, lost in thought. She was a simple farm woman who didn't know much about the ways of the world. She couldn't understand why her husband had been detained for a chicken, and she didn't understand why the people in gray uniforms said there were guns in her house. She also didn't understand why they took her daughter Xiubao's betrothal silver chain and other items. They even took the only field deed she had to pawn. Poor, simple mind, how could she understand this complicated scene? Suddenly, the barking of the little dog broke her confused thoughts. Could it be that Ah Kun had returned? She strained her ears to listen. After a while, the footsteps got closer. She pushed open the half-closed wooden door. Sure enough, it was her husband who had come in. He Kun's wife immediately stood up, a happy smile on her face, and said:</p>
<p>"You're back! I've been waiting for you until I'm exhausted! Did the people in gray uniforms bring back Xiubao's silver chain? Do you know that our field deed was taken by Mayor Li to pawn for money?" Ah Kun's wife was truly a typical farm woman, simple and innocent, just not understanding complicated worldly affairs, still asking such questions.</p>
<p>"What? The field deed was taken away? That's going to kill me!" Ah Kun suddenly looked gloomy, opened his eyes, glared at his wife, staring at her for a long time, then looked down, a few tears dripping down, extraordinarily painful.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep! It's already midnight. You promised the Shen family in Hebei to dig a ditch tomorrow, right?" Ah Kun's wife urged her husband to rest. After a while, Ah Kun returned to the bedroom and his wife fell asleep, but she kept replaying the scene just now in her mind, how could she fall asleep? She listened to her wife and daughter Xiubao, who were both snoring soundly.</p>
<p>The fish-belly white light of the east gradually became transparent, and the rising sun slowly rose. Ah Kun had not slept well, his head was dizzy. He got up, grabbed a stool, and sat on the ground outside the door. In the slightly dark morning, the air was exceptionally fresh. On the sidewalk on the south bank, a few scattered people were hurrying to the market in town. (12)</p>

<h3>Dr. Feng Initiates Free Clinic</h3>
<p>Dr. Cheng Zu came to Yang yesterday and said: "I have been studying various diseases related to opium addicts and smoking for more than ten years, from the initial stage of the disease to the final stage of opium leakage, etc. I have a little experience. Now, in order to assist your newspaper's charity for education, I will provide free consultations every morning, without charging any fees. However, those who are cured will voluntarily donate some money for your newspaper's scholarship fund. Patients not only receive practical treatment but also do not waste consultation fees. I will also do my part. Recently, whooping cough has become prevalent among children. This disease is not caused by external influences, but by prolonged dampness. If left untreated, the dampness will penetrate inward and turn into phlegm over time, blocking the lung meridian. The desire to expel the phlegm causes coughing. It is also trapped by dampness. This coughing and choking continues almost non-stop. In severe cases, the body may be hunched over, and vomiting may occur. Prolonged coughing damages the lung vessels, leading to hemoptysis. If further delayed, many complications will arise. The clinic is located at No. 37, Galaxy Lane, Huwei Road, French Concession (no house number on the door)."</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers' Training Course Begins Officially Yesterday</h3>
