<h3>社評　重慶收回了些什麽？　英美交還了些什麼？</h3>
<p>上海租界的交回，治外法權撒發協定的實踐，這是國民政府三年來和平政策的結果，這是友邦日本對華政策眞意的表現，在今日，國人必須平心靜氣的觀察現實，明辨是非，認淸自己的地位，抉擇自己的方向了。</p>
<p>我們在今天，感謝友邦日本的道義精神，認淸國民政府國策之正確，並且東視東亞民族解放與共存共榮前途的勝利。但是，同時，正因爲我們是中國人，我們不只要慶祝身邊的喜事，我們還要暸望到較遠的國土的一隅，我們關念到在巾慶政地下的國土和同胞，却有無限的遺憾與創痛。</p>
<p>重慶的「抗戰」，說是爲了爭取中華民族的解放，獨立與自由，也說是爲了擺脫不平等條約的束縛，使中華民國成爲亞洲　立自中的國家。然而，戰爭已進入第七年了，我們現在縱使不再提起國家民族和老百姓的犧牲是如何鉅大慘重，我們也不忍說起戰爭帶給國家民族與東亞的是如何嚴重的災禍，我們只問，六年來，重慶政權所給我們的允諾，能不能兌現？不平等條約完全廢除了嗎？獨立自生的地位在那裹？更具體的說，我們要問，重慶收回了些什麼？英美交還了些什麽？</p>
<p>爲着欺騙國民和國際，重慶自民國三十年五月就開始對英對美進行廢除不平等條約和改訂新約的談判，而爲了同樣目的，爲了欺騙中國人民與混淆國際視聽，英美也遠在民國三十年表示允許與重慶改訂新約。然而，實際上，不過是沒有雨點的雷聲，英美絕不肯放棄其非法的特權，重慶也不敢認眞提出廢除不平等條約的要求。直到大東亞戰爭爆發，友邦日本的事威，席捲太平洋，西逼印度，東脅美洲，從此之後，英美在華一切特權，實際上巳不再存在，狡猾的英美，才肯慷他人之慨，在三十一年十一月，與重慶政權簽訂所謂中英中美新約。不過，就是在這有名無實的條約中，英美還裝腔做勢，加以時間上，地區上，及其他　種條件與保留，蔣介石在他最近出版的「中國的命運」一書中，也不能不嘆息這種「新約」還有「美中不足」之點，他舉出英國當局不允許談及交還九龍租借地的不友誼的態度。</p>
<p>其實，英美對重慶，一如對全中國，完全沒有「道義」可言。就是一草一木之微，也要先問是否對本國有利，一切政策，都從木國的利益，特權及制覇出發的。英國之不願與重慶談判九龍租借地問題題，不過是最明顯的一例而巳。美國又何嘗不如此？在重慶，特別是在華盛頓的報上，已經然鬧了一年多的「於改限制華人入境案」，這種微細不値一顧的問題，也居然爭執年餘，迄未獲得美國常局的同意，其侮視華人與瞧不起重慶爲何似，難道還不明白嗎？一方面，英美對於壓迫束縛華人的特權，斤斤較量，錙銖不肯放棄：另一方面，對於有名無寶的「新約」，却向重慶索取最高的代價，如英美在渝軍事代表團之常駐，如美空空在西南的常駐，如重慶所有軍隊，政府與生產機構顧問及技師的專任，以至內政，敎育等等，無不授大權於英美人之手。重慶政權所謂「躋於四大强國之列」，如是而已！</p>
<p>英美固然不願眞正放棄對中國任何一項特權，且以失之於東部而更加强壓抑重慶，以取之於西南，電慶却恬然無恥，以「　除不平等條約已告實現」，及「國民革命巳告初步成功」而妄自尊大，夢想與夢囈交作，以岡刺激人心。實際上，重慶政權根本無所謂外交，要有也只表現宋美齡宋子文之赴英美演幾慕喜劇而巳！現在，宋美　同到重慶之後，還是不知悔禍，充分暴露阿Q的精神，希望日蘇戰爭早日開塲，希望美國全力在太平洋方面「反攻」。自己則乘機關起門來，擴充勢力到青海去，到新疆去。</p>
<p>以如此無道義而唯利是圖的英美，以如此阿Q式的重慶政權，他們的失敗與沒落，巳經是無待卜著了？然而他們在崩潰沒落的過程之中，正在竭力製造黑霧，企圖掩蔽光明，欺騙民衆，甘心作中華民族解放的罪人：作東亞民族革命的叛徒，以阻滯大東亞戰爭及新中國建設。我錦繡河山，黑了半邊，這是我們在慶祝上海租界交還及中國主權完整的今日所不能不感到一則以喜一則以痛的地方！我們一方面希望國民政府加倍努力，建設起新的中國，並協力完遂大東亞戰爭，早日消除我們西南西北的暗雲陰霧，還我完整與錦繡的山河，一方面仍熱誠盼望渝方覺悟份子，加倍努力，掃除黑暗，共歸光明！</p>

<h3>日積極建設共榮圈　爪哇人獲參政機會　原田促協力完成使命</h3>
<p>爪加爾達二日中央社電　爪哇方而日派造軍原田最高指揮官一日晚八時曾作廣播，閘明爪哇設置中央參議院及參議會，以實施參政等中體方策，而使原住民得早日參與政治後，並要求五千萬民衆各自忠於職守，完成其任命。茲誌原田指揮官廣播原意如次。。日軍於爪哇登陸以來，爪哇五千萬住民對於日軍之作戰，已作相當之協力，關於其此種誠意及努力，現地軍當局及日本政府無不深爲感謝，故尙望其能由現在之活動，進而參與政治。東條首相於第八十二屆臨時議t曾闡明許可爪哇住民參與政治，余基於政府之此種方針，及適應爪哇軍政之現狀，巳決定早日實施此具體措置．今於此說明其一大要：　選拔具有崇高人格與深遠見識之現地住民，於軍政部內段置踏詢機關，而促進爪哇軍政之順利進展。（甲於中央設　中央參議院，以建議及宣達軍政諸施使。（乙）各州（包括特別市）　置參議會，以建議及宣達地方政務。　軍政諸行政機關選拔有爲之原住民，置於軍政之重要地位以推進軍　。（甲）實施中央軍政監部參與制度，以使具有高深知識與經驗之現地佳氏，直接參劃各部施策之審議等。　地方州廳及其他軍政諸機關登用現地佳民，擔當施行軍政之任等。倘爪哇住民在對此新任務能盡其全力全責。對大東亞戰爭多所貢獻而獲得日政府之信賴，則日政府常予以更大之活躍範圍。關於以上種種，余深切希望現地住民諸君深體余之眞意，奮起以完成其新使命。</p>
<p>爪加爾達二日中央社電　此次此次軍原田最高指揮官發表關於爪哇原住民指導者，參戰之聲明後，原住民。均表歡迎，茲粽合彼等意見如次：　英美每於其本國陷於窮境時，輒對其殖民地加以懷柔，然於過後必食其言，此乃彼等之慣技，但以歡日本於光輝之勝利中，着者實行其不動方策，足表示日政府對確立共榮圈之眞意。　日本占領荷印後，以三百五十日之短期問，即將舊荷印政府三百五十年來之　政完全掃除，揭起建設新爪哇之大旗，並迅速表示日本解放亞洲民族建設共榮　之熱意。此次日最高指揮官發表聲明，可知確立共榮圈建設新爪哇之根本理念，乃以翼贊服務精神與實踐爲基礎，並指示現地住民協力　成戰爭之方向。　此次日最高指揮官聲明原住民參政之內容，乃實踐東條聲明之第一步措置，中央地方對參與政治之協力態勢即將整備，現地住民莫不對當局抱極大希望與期待云。</p>
<h3>緬甸獨立夙願已償　東條首相談話　日本仍將予以全面支援使新緬甸完成復興大業</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日東條首相於一日發表關於緬甸獨立談話，大意謂：「本日緬甸宜吿獨立，兼對英美宣戰，故帝國當即承認緬甸國，並與該國締結同盟條約。回顧緬甸企求獨立，爲時巳久，但在英國壓制之下遭受途炭之苦，然大東亞戰爭發生後，由於日軍將士舊勇作戰，朱幾即於緬甸驅出英美軍，緬甸內外情勢因此完全改變。自是以來，緬甸復興之大業急速進　，緬甸多年來之宿望，自大東亞戰爭發生以來爲時巳一年有半，即告逢緬甸獨立之歷史的紀念日，於感激聖恩宏大之餘，復深爲緬甸國慶賀。我軍在緬甸開始作戰後，巴莫氏等緬甸志士繼承緬甸諸先烈之遺志，努力爭取獨立，衷心協力我軍作戰，對於爭取緬甸獨立及貫澈大東亞戰爭日夜努力，其問有多數忠勇義烈之我軍將士陣亡於戰塲，又有許多緬甸勇士忠誠殉難，余於此緬　爲爭取緬甸獨立而殉難之多數志士偉功之餘，對努力創建緬甸之巴莫氏及緬甸民衆之奮鬥與共協力我軍，深表敬佩。同時對我軍將士在緬甸作戰所建之奇勳，亦深表敬意，並對陣亡於戰塲之我軍及緬甸勇士謹致悼意。緬甸民衆已自今日起獲得獨立國國民之光榮，可謂榮幸，一國於獨立後順利發展，誠非易事，故緬甸人民爲謀將來緬甸之順利發展，尤應加緊努力，而帝國今後爲緬甸國之興隆，仍予以全面支援者，自不待言。今緬甸業已獲得獨立，大東亞戰爭目的亦因此逐漸完成，但大東亞戰爭若不獲得最後勝利，大東亞之解放難期完成，故吾人須知大東亞戰爭之前途因難尙多，但任何困難均須克服，任何障礙亦將破除，吾人必能於衆望之下獲得勝利，而此亦即爲我國之光輝傳統。時至今日，大東亞十億民族之團結更爲鞏固，而已充分發揮大東亞之總力，吾人對完成大東亞戰爭旣充滿鬥志，且大東亞十億民族巳爲完成大東亞戰爭而團結一致，故大東亞十億民族之前途，可謂已充滿無限光明。</p>
<h3>日任命磯村　駐緬武官</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日陸軍省發表任命陸軍上將磯村歡亮為日本駐緬大使館武官。</p>
<h3>褚外長發表談話　大東亞民族愈臻團結擊滅英美之心益堅決</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊外交部褚部長，爲緬甸獨立，昨發表談話如下：緬甸受英帝國主義者之宰割及荼毒已久，今日吾人得見該邦之獨立，願站在東亞同志之立塲，致其深切忻慰之情。尤以中緬疆土　連，過去關係素稱密切，自一八八六年淸廷被迫，不得不承認英國在緬所秉之政權，今緬甸脫離英國之羈絆，成爲一獨立自由之國家，吾人衷心慶賀，非可言喻。</p>
<p>自英國侵略勢力滔滔東進，印度緬甸首攖毒熖，英國　陰狠之手段，刻毒之法，施於印度，並以向一方式施於緬甸，百年以來，吾人亦受英國之侵略壓迫，至於今日，故欲一興復東亞，必先驅除英美即爲其中之一，</p>
<p>緬甸民族，深明大義，自友邦日軍敉平緬甸後，在賢明的巴莫行政長官指導之下，一致團結，協力友邦，致力於大東亞之建設，亦即於大東亞建設中，薪致新緬甸之靑成，與積極之努力，殊堪盛偑。</p>
<p>友邦日本對於東亞諸緬甸人士於友邦此種支援組成緬甸獨立準備委員會積極進行獨立之一切準備。最近友邦東倏首相，於議會中表明日本對緬甸之熱望，具見友邦熱望緬甸獨立之至誠。緬甸民族現終因自身之努力，與友邦之援助，而實現獨立。深信緬甸獨立之後，其他尙在英美壓迫下之民族，必深爲感奮，繼起奮鬥，行見大東亞十億民族，將因緬甸之獨立，愈臻團結，意堅擊滅宿敵英美之決心，可以無疑。吾人今日逖聽緬甸獨立，除對緬甸民族深致賀忱外，對於大東亞建設前途，亦不勝慶幸。今日緬甸獨立，適逢我國接收上海公共租界之期，上海公共租界爲英美侵略東亞之最大據點，而過去緬甸則爲英美侵略東亞之前哨，今一旦同復於東亞人之手，實爲英美在東亞勢力之告終，但英美蠢動，至今未已，吾人爲保衛此業已解放之東亞，更須團結一致與友邦日太戮力邁進，以貫澈戰爭目的完成東亞共榮之偉業，想整個東亞十億民族亦必同此決心也。</p>

<p>伯倫二日中央社電　西島戰事已進入第四週，而協約軍仍爲軸心軍之堅强抵抗所阻，在四部內地敵軍以呎或碼之速度前進，在東部方面則仍被阻於喀太尼亞之前，德義軍隊有良好之壕溝隱蔽，在東北部之米西那有堅强之根據地，　能保護米西那海峽，茍該處爲敵軍所佔，則敵軍即可順利進入義國大陸。路透社亦承認美軍在四部現陷於困難之地位，軸心軍之抵抗加强，可於美軍停滯於桑斯蒂法諾地方證明之。</p>

<h3>確立中心思想樹立中心勢力　「建設新上海最重要的工作」　汪主席招待記者談話</h3>
<p>汪主席於二日下午四時在上海行轅招待中外新聞記者談話如下：去年九月，爲視察淸鄉，道經上海，曾與各位見面，再過一個月，就是一年，今日又得與各位相見，心裏覺得非常愉快。</p>
<p>去年見面時，所說的偏重於淸鄉問題，現在上海兩租界之收囘H作，承友邦日本的幹旋，曁義法兩國的美意，得告實現，所以今日相見，又感覺另一種愉快。</p>
<p>兄弟想要說的，已在昨天廣播詞及民衆代表大會演講詞中發表，今天不想贅說，今天本來只想聽聽各位的意見，自己不打算發表什麼，今晨恰接到幾位先　的來信，提出「建設新上海最先應着手而最重要的H作是什麼」的問題，這雖然不是各位先生全體的意見，但旣然有了這一個問題，就想對這一個問題作一個解答。</p>
<p>兄弟以爲建設新上海最重要的在確立中心思想，樹立中心勢力，爲什麼呢，現在分三點來講：</p>
<p>泯除租界舊痕找一個共同點</p>
<p>第一，過去上海，一部分是屬於中國的，一部分是公共租界，又一部分是法租界，雖然自大東亞戰爭以後，公共粗界已由友邦接管，但租界的痕跡，猶未悄除，這三塊地，立塲各自不同，因此而　成思想的分歧，自不待言，現在要合併起來，最重要的，就是找一個共同點，所以必須有一個中心思想，中心勢力，纔能使三塊不同的地卞成爲一致。</p>
<p>澄清不同見解防禦思想毒素</p>
<p>第二，上海有五百萬民衆，經濟。文化。敎育思想，極爲龐雜。各種不同的見解，同時存在，是無可諱言的。如果專用消極方法，加以禁止，使不能見於文字，是無效的。即使要他們依照我們所要說的說出來，但不是由衷心發出，也是無效的。如果要立刻求其一致，亦屬事非容易，所以必須確立一個中心思想，樹立了中心勢力，纔能夠頜導。中心，對外對內都還維持其交通站的地位，這種地方最容易受素素思想的攻入與混擾，如果不確立中心思想不樹立中心勢立對外對內的思想戰的力量是不夠的。</p>
<p>爭取戰爭勝利已爲唯一生路</p>
<p>所以我說建設新上海，最先亦最重要的工作，在確立中心思想，樹立中心勢力，然則怎謀確立中心思想，怎樣樹立中心勢力呢？我認爲是確定大東亞戰爭的信念，確認除爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，中國沒有第二條生路的信念。我們深知中國現在所能貢獻於大東亞戰爭的，只是保障治安，增加生產。就是要做到這兩點，也非必先確立大東亞戰爭信念不可。淸鄉工作，過去之目的在拓展和平，現在則為維持大東亞戰爭後方治安，增加生產。過去之目的，在改善人民經濟生活，現在則為提高貢獻於大東亞戰爭之力量。</p>
<p>爲戰爭而消耗爲戰爭而生產</p>
<p>說到增加生產，或者有人認爲可笑。以爲今日生產尙談不到，說什麼增加生產呢？殊不知戰爭時代，一方面不斷消耗，一方面就要不斷生產。悄耗是爲大東亞戰爭而消耗，生產亦爲大東亞戰爭而生產。這樣纔能夠把生產的目的確定。總而言之人民必先有對參加大東亞戰爭之熱忱，才能節約消費，增加生產。怎樣才能鼓起中國人民，尤其是上海人民，對大東亞戰爭的熱忱呢？必須確立大東亞戰爭之信念，確立中國捨爭取大東亞戰爭勝利外，絕無第二條生路的信念，這樣才能由信念而發生力量。</p>
<p>肅淸侵略勢力保障地方治安</p>
<p>對於保障治安，增加生產是如此，對於思想，也是如此。比如說：肅淸英美毒素的思想，爲什麼要肅淸呢？因爲英美是東亞的敵人，如果我們能積極的建立大東亞戰爭的信念，則悄極方面，必然可能肅淸英美侵略思想的毒素。</p>
<p>建設新上海，百端待舉，如保障治安，增加生產，肅淸英美毒素思想，但工作之重點，則當集中於建立對大東亞戰爭的信念。</p>
<p>此次新國民運動，舉辦靑少年及公務人員暑期集訓營之意義，亦即在此。暑期集訓於管理方面，最爲不易，且易生時疫。此次之所以在暑期召集靑少年及公務人員集訓，不是特童選定暑期，在一月九日國府參加大東亞戰爭後，立即　備集訓，籌備妥當恰値暑期，上月在南京第一期集訓，第二期集訓就在上海。集訓的目的，在確定大東亞戰爭之信念，使之能在大東亞戰爭中發揮力量，此次受訓人員，雖僅五六百人，政府的目的，在　少數靑年及公務員着手漸次擴充，普及於上海及全國。這樣上海才能確立中心思想，樹立中心勢力。</p>
<p>緬甸巴莫總理言論實堪欽佩</p>
<p>友邦記者或問：中國究有多大力最參加大東亞戰爭呢？我們是否過分誇張自負呢？我認爲力量固甚重要，但建立大東亞戰爭之信念，尤爲第一要着，因爲必先有信念，才能發生力量。所以今日唯有根據國父大亞洲主義遺敎爲基礎，再根據友邦帝國政府歷次團結束亞之官言，確定信念，緬甸巴莫總理發表演講謂：「緬甸在戰爭中立國在戰爭中產生，在戰爭中存在，J我深爲佩服巴莫總理之指導，緬甸民衆的方針。</p>
<p>國民政府參戰後，即提出「同生共死」之口號，這不是空洞的，我門對內要同生共死，對友邦也要同生共死，非有共死的決心，無以得同生之命運。</p>
<p>以勇氣去忍受無可免的苦痛</p>
<p>我還有幾句話要對本國記者說的，我們必須以確立大東亞戰爭信念，爲言論的中心目標，不僅是新聞如此，即副刋亦應如此，我亦知報章編輯不能單調，須加入別種口味以爲調節。複雜無妨，但不能同一報章而言論思想却呈矛盾現象。對於經濟生活之艱苦以及個人自由的不滿足而發出的呻吟，我們自當同情，不過最重要的是苦痛而可以設法避免者，如因行政方法之不良，經濟組織之不健全，則應解除得一分是一分；如里苦痛而是在戰爭中無可避免者，則應該鼓勵人民以勇氣去忍受，要像浴血前綫的戰士一樣，一面冒着艱辛，一面還是高默。</p>
<p>總之，我們惟有認淸建設新上海中所缺乏者是什麽？所需要者是什麽？儘力做去，在上海這樣複雅的地方，最先且最重要的厥在建立對大東亞戰爭的中心思想，集中力量來擔負大東亞戰爭中中國應盡的責任。</p>
<h3>短評　怎樣建設新上海</h3>
<p>汪主席昨天招待本市新聞界，發表談話，我們於細讀之後，略申管見如次：</p>
<p>第一，主席說建設新上海，最重要的「確立中心思想，樹立中心勢力」。我們應該擁護。更可以說，這中心思想與中心勢力，目的就是人民與政府打成一片，內容就是政府領導於上，人民翼贊於下，建設新上海。</p>
<p>第二，大東亞戰爭勝利信念之確立，是絕對必要的。可是，我們認爲要確立大東亞戰爭勝利信念，必先確立和平信念。我們曾經說過，和平區內1般人尤其是黨政人員巾間，除少數領導者外，很多的對於和平信念不夠堅定，因之對於大東亞戰爭勝利信念史形薄弱。這是應該加以糾正的。</p>
<p>第三，人民對於經濟生活之苦痛，不能忍受，固然因爲未曾確立大東亞戰爭勝利的信念所致。主席告訴我們在戰爭中無可避免的苦痛，應該以勇氣去忍受。這也是我們應該接受的。譬如在戰時，我們就應該遵守戰時法令，克盡戰時義務，節衣縮食，刻苦忍受。但是現在的苦痛，很多是可以避免的，舉1個最顯著的例，就是物價高漲。日本和南洋各地，同樣在戰時，可是他們的物價高漲是有限度的，是合理的，這叮證明我們比較特殊的地方。主席也說，可以避免的苦痛，如因行政方法之不良典經濟組織之不健全，則應解除一分是一分。我們認爲只憑經濟制度與經濟法令的調整，還不夠力量解除經濟危機，而必須行政方法絕對合理與良善，才能眞正的解除人民經濟生活的苦痛。也就是堅定和平信念，進而確立大東亞戰爭勝利信念的有力因素。</p>

<h3>廣田報道課長談　軸心國作戰目的　根據道義上的企求</h3>
<p>日大使館事務所廣田報道課長，二日於招待外人記者團席上，曾述及英美方面與軸心國作戰之目的，謂軸心國方面之作戰目的，係根據道義上　企求；而英美所存心者，純屬</p>
<p>制世界</p>
<p>廣田課長述稱：日本於八月一日已將上海公共租界交還　　，並承認緬甸獨立，　兩者可昭示日本對東亞　民族之獨立與自由，如何具有熱忱及眞摯之誠意，蓋由於上海公共租界之交還，在中國領土上再無租界存在，此對中國之謀求完成獨立，予以極大援助力量。此外保證緬甸之獨立，係自去年八月以來，由巴莫長官等繼續交涉，約歷一載，此次乃吿實現。以上兩事實，即係日本對中國及緬甸兩民族之政策，但此可理解爲僅　日本早已預定之大東亞政策中之一部份而巳。所謂</p>
<p>東亞秩序</p>
<p>之抽象的名詞，由以上兩事賞可以作最具體的表示，更由此可見日政府所提倡之政策必將見諸實施。吾人對此兩點，可指出日方之戰爭目的，及途行政策之態度與英美相較，如何具有誠意，以及內容充實，一言以蔽之，反軸心國戰爭目的，乃在維持英帝國之現狀，不過係企圖以美國全權主義霸制世界之野心而已。英美之戰爭目的，揚言在打倒世界上納粹主義及法西斯主義，並被壞日德義現政權政治組織，但顧彼等實際行動，亦以明暸係在企圖</p>
<p>完全破壞</p>
<p>日德義之全民族政治組織，但英美爲何以三國之國民特別目爲敵人，蓋因該三國爲抵抗英美霸制世界之强國故也。彼等所求者欲將世界五十餘國各予分裂，使其對立，而英美在其間展其政治謀略，以期其本國霸持世界的實權。然察破彼等政治上謀略培殖，對抗實力出諸一戰者，即日德義三國也。易言之，爲求超過世界二十萬萬人類半數以上民族之獨立自由而戰者，爲日德義三國，而英美謀首先擊漬些二國後，再行</p>
<p>分裂各國</p>
<p>此言既非證張之詞，亦非有意加罪於英美。回想過去英美途行其如何之政策，歷觀巴黎會議，凡爾賽條約，以及其後之國際聯盟政策等卽可一目瞭然．其間各國受英美之羈維困窮已極，此均係歷史上之事實，又在東亞方面，自華府會議後之情勢是以對抗英美覇制世界之方法，惟有一途，此卽日德義所提倡建設，世界新秩序是也。而其根幹不外乎爲使英美不能覇制世界，其他五十餘國應在政治上，文化上，及精神上，密切結合，俾與英美之霸制對抗，捨此別無他途，如果欲防止由於各國之飢餓與貧困，而供英美國民之侈奢生活，則唯一方法卽建設世界新秩序，英美兩國對戰爭之目的，持有非常高遠之理想，彼雖言爲各民族</p>
<p>自由獨立</p>
<p>計，果如是則爲何不對印度予以如日本所予緬甸之獨立乎。日本對菲律賓最近亦將予以獨立，但美國雖於一九三六年在馬格遠菲法案中，約以予菲律賓獨立，但至今未見實行，又英美曾表出所謂四種自由，以爲戰爭目的，當然吾人對此全不信任，事實上彼等於過去何賞有一點實行，最近彼等以大西洋憲章視作廢紙，又約定使波蘭獨立保全而終不守諾言。若再回憶前事威爾遜曾描出十四條以謀德國崩潰，繼以如巴黎條約苛酷條件，加諸其身，此種事實，與日木於八月一日如期交還上海公共租界，承認緬何獨立等態度比較，適成相反，因之此際須加汁意者，卽在認淸</p>
<p>敵人面目</p>
<p>彼等在與地國接近時、每用甘　蜜語，但一旦若他國不從、則突然翻其面日矣。吾人若注意彼等以言而不行之甜言密語接近吾等，此卽敵人謀破壞　等國家團結，破壞軸心國間之同盟關係也。要之。吾人建設世界新秩序之目的，爲合於世界全人類之正義者。但英美之目的，不過爲新制世界野心而已，故吾人現在唯一必要者，須以對於遂行戰爭之鞏固決意。戰至最後勝利而後已。</p>

<h3>慶祝接收租界足球賽　三省戰勝西聯　褚部長親臨致詞陳市長開球義球由李松齡氏七萬元拍去</h3>
<p>三省體育會，爲慶祝國府收囘租界而主辦之助學金足球義賽，於昨日下千六時，在熱烈情况下，於逸　球塲展幕。由三省隊出戰西聯隊，結果三省隊後來居上，二比一高奏凱歌，墓名作璧上觀者·不下萬餘人，盛况空前。</p>
<p>開幕典禮隆重舉行</p>
<p>時間旣屆，大會即在全塲千萬觀衆歡　擁護聲揭開序幕，軍樂悠揚之國　，在全體肅立下，響澈於大會塲中。繼由褚部致揭幕辭。語多勉勵。次由陳布長行開球禮，大賽於焉展開。</p>
<p>上半時西聯攻勢盛</p>
<p>西聯聞始進攻，被高致文撲成角球，三省即行反攻。孫老　得宋靈聖來球，正擬釜底抽薪，詎意奧列維拉自前方趕囘救駕，拚力一鏟，致老孫功虧一簀。旋而孫老錦又向　門開出角球，亦被G蘇石接個正着而成畫餅·三省數度環攻，均失之交臂，未能佔領城池，而四聯却否極泰來，奧列維拉從人叢中殺出血路，遠交A柯拉沙。柯底邊勾中，卡洛列區衝前乘勢一頂，高致文不防這致冷箭，球即直竄入網，一比〇西聯領先。三省豈肯示弱、敬路反攻，惜均朱能馬到功成。反觀四聯，攻勢仍織，宰三省後衛　祺祥李天生，鎭守有方，一一化險爲夷。未幾上半時即告終了，三省途以此一球之失而暫受屈。</p>
<p>丁部長主持拍義球</p>
<p>休息時間，由丁部長點邨，全拍義球，競　頗爲熱烈，創拍賣義球新紀錄之拍價，亦因競拍之過趨然烈，扶遙直上，層見迭出，迨最後霎那，夏士魁抬高至六萬五千元時，李松齡亦義不後人，以七萬元之最高價購去，仁風義舉，殊深慶佩。</p>
<p>結果三省二對一勝</p>
<p>義球拍過，雙方整軍再戰，三省改變戰策，果奏功效，十分鐘時，瞿永福截得卡洛列區之來球，刀劈V蘚石，W潘脫遜二關，向前猛衝，奧列維拉圖救心急·二十四碼處誤犯手球。孫老錦主罰，鐵腿不凡，一蹴即吿命中，一比一雙方戰成和局。於是兩隊戰局，更趨激烈，在塲觀衆，亦莫爲三省呼聲助威，爲我中華吐氣揚眉。　此舉國同慶萬民歡騰，接收租界之際，爲我大中華民族永奠勝利之基石，三省將士，果不負　衆所寄予之盡望，遂即三軍用命，在右衝右突，五路夾攻下，費春華邊祇關來，流落敵方門前，周德法待個正着，銜前輕輕一撥，遂吿命中，二比一三省後來居上。於此觀衆歡呼之聲振天，手帕與帽子齊飛，而爆竹之聲，亦不斷交響於逸　天空。少焉時間吿終，三省以此寶貴一球之得遂即高癸凱　。</p>

<h3>陳巿長與東京都長官　交換廣播演詞　「租界設立百年受盡恥辱今得友邦協力交還深願今後經濟與文化合一法律與正義合一」</h3>
<p>上海法國專管租界及公北租界業經我國先後　敎，上海特別市市長陳公博對友邦日本之協力，深表感謝，特於二日下午十時至三十五分，在大上洛廣播電台與東京都長官大　茂雄氏作交梚廣播，茲錄陳市長廣播詞原文如下。</p>
<p>東京都長官大達閣下：</p>
<p>今日正當上海的公共租界和法國最後之上　租界收囘之後，和閣下交換廣播，殊使本人深深感覺　幸與愉快，水入深信國下必與本人共同異有榮宰與愉快的同感。</p>
<p>這次中國對於一切在華外國租界的收囘，對於貴國的協力，實有無限的感謝與　實，囘想責國在中國參加大東亞戰爭之日，貴國即正式聲明撒　在華的治外法權，井交囘專管租界，以後即首先於三月二十九日國民政府遼都紀念那一天，實行交囘貴國專管租界，並且協力於其他各國交囘專管租界以及公共租界，　　這　靠大勇毅的行為，充分表現東方的精神和中日的友誼，大東亞共樂　的基礎以及中日兩國間的永久　誼，也由此可以奠定了。</p>
<p>上海公共租界的設立，已有百年，而中關國際地位的降落，也有百年，這種恥辱，不僅是中國的恥辱。也是東亞民族共同的恥辱，這次得貴國的協力，將粗界一旦收囘，使中國完成其獨立與自由，也不　是中國的光　，也是東亞民族共同的光榮。</p>
<p>大上海市以前因於租之設立，產生無窮的惡果，經濟雖然繁榮，然而經濟和文化是不合一的，法律雖然存在，然而法律和正義是不合一的，換一句話說，上海有租界一日的存在，便是空有經濟而無文化，空有法律而無正義，從今以後，收囘租界，上海不但行政可以統一，本人尤願使經濟與文化合一，法律與正義合一、使上海成爲東方文明的都市，與貴國的東京都相媲美。</p>
<p>我們對於大上海今後發展的方案，芷在考慮和計劃，對於一切建設，不祇研究如何使它復興，抑且研究如何使它更加發　，對於治安，不祇努力使它維持，抑且努力使它確立，使大東亞戰爭的後方，永保無處，我們更且研究對於市民福利使它增　「尤其對於貴國僑民極力保障，以期達到中日共同努力同井　進的　的。</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭以後，上海巳成爲後方的大兵飲，這是貴我兩國所共同承認，我們根據必將的信念，必須使這個大兵站繼續生產，繼續供給，使市民的生產力與戰爭的勝利　　而行，更使巿氏的種種也隨着戰爭的勝利而增進，本人希望貴國政府和　國在上海的人民，體念這個意旨而再予我們以更大的協力。</p>
<p>東京　是　爾的首都，也是世界有名的大都巿，對於市政的設施，建設的規模，在在都可以作上海的模範，本人　希望閣下對於上海的市政，不各指敎。</p>
<p>東京和上海在東方是兩個極大的都市，在精神上更　同兄第，對於經濟協力文化交流，可以稱爲東方的用大中心，今後我們的交接更密切了，我們的力最夏加張了，本人　願閣下本其學戲與經騐，對於上海減判別　以援助。</p>
<p>今天承蒙閣下交換　播，至為感謝，願以至　祝中日兩國共同發展，祝大東東與大上海共同發展，敬祝閣下健康，敬祝大東京市民宰福。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點五十分</p>
<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　租界接收後的上海經濟</h3>
<p>「百年難　　朝春」的年頭帶來了「百年方　還租界！」</p>
<p>自八月一日起·租界絕跡於全中國，盛大的慶祝也已奉行過了，現在　我們來談一　租界　囘後的上海經濟。</p>
<p>租界收囘後的租界巿民，不　有以生會財　此後無確實保　為慮者；此種思想買在是要不得的　國人　於租界者，不過五五六百萬人　居於非租界者、較此多過八九十倍。試問此八十倍國人的生命財產，豈　危如景　麽？靑島無租界，蘇杭無租界　　紹無用界，此數處居民生命財產的安全，推能說不如以前上每的租界呢？生命財產既不發生問題、則租界收囘以　的上海　齊，至少必能維持以往的繁榮。</p>
<p>上海過去的繁榮，除自然的地理優勢外，尤待人為的政治外交優勢。現在人爲的優勢一掃而空，故其擴大繁榮的機會，此後必須與國內其他都會平等分潤，不當再行獨佔。這是上海市民應當認識的又一點。上海生　賬病，內地生賣血症，兩敗俱傷，可憐可痛，從茲以後，此病此症。或能相互調劑，彼此霍然。</p>
<p>過去上海的繁榮祇及租界，此後上海的繁榮自將擴及四郊和附近都市，使租界的人口與資力，得以漸漸疏散，使長江下游各處，得以平均發展．這實在是租界收囘以後。最合理的經濟變動。</p>
<h3>租界接收後之　本巿巿塲情形</h3>
<p>昨日爲上海祖界收囘侵之第二日，亦爲市塲復業之第一日（因前日適逢星期例假），由於環境之推動，一般人對於市塲情况及今後可能發生之新形勢，異常注目。茲將一般情形，分誌如下：</p>
<p>市面平靜安定物價</p>
<p>上海舊租界區城過去因　培之特殊，投機商人，　集營利，故成游資浮動，囤貨充塞之大本營，租界收囘前，負責當局對於囤積貨物，憶開始作有效制裁，抑平物價，更不遣餘力，故當此租界收囘之隊，昨晨各業開巿，巿况安定如恒，物價亦無劇烈　動，各市塲趨勢均呈風平浪靜之局，如華股，金，銀等市氣平和，價有僅小上落公債則已囘下。棉布行情略見鬆動，棉紗依然呆滯，價格平定，其他各樂均在平種狀態中。</p>
<p>澈查工作繼續進行</p>
<p>又悉，租界妝囘前工部局及物資調查委員會對於澈查囤貨，取締黑市，異常努力，租界收囘後，今後我市政府當局對於第一第八兩區內黑市之取締及圃貨之澈查，仍將會同有關方面繼續進行，在短期間內，大規模之澈查H作又將展開。至於對各金融機關之檢查，今後亦將加緊進行，務使各金融機關之營業，絲毫無非法之處。</p>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股。徘徊轉疲，雖有對於股票放任消息，但在各市低落聲中，人心不免轉却，獲利求脫轉殷，且在久漲之後，購抬者力亦不弱，各股雖多見軋小，而帶盤，惟一小部一份仍見軋漲，而再創新高峯，小票面紡織股與實業股尤爲投資者所垂靑，百貨業之永安公司亦曾出現新價，終見退入關內，略見軋小，新新及國貨公司迂迥微升，內衣稍見囘挫，景福衫權再叩六關，漲勞較勁，景輪亦哄出兩關外，紡織業之永安紡機有百數起伏，哄升後囘下略見軋小，宏甡，美綸，新豐，振豐，榮豐，國光，國信等小票面各股仍在　勢中提上，大中華織造又造一關。大生　資消息證實，價見權跳，文化　商務，中華仍呆站前價。世界略見同低，新藥業新亞略小數元，乃大漲後應有之小囘顯，中法無巿。五洲仍見軋升，　誼，中西平定，公用業之問北水電及畢商電氣挺升，甚銳，南洋烟公司，大中華火　微見削低，新益及聯華地產高峯再創，標準味粉仍在買勞中登峯造極，福民及吉美食品堅挺·康元製罐緊站原價。大華蓄植，晋豐造紙，中興木業，華一造船求多供少，保安玻璃增資送一認二證實，驟見高昻，實樂股久安再見高價，大中華實業巳迫叫關，近午尤步　不止。中國投資挺秀，　華實業初　塲，價　票面二倍六、　求者未止。</p>

<h3>西西里島的風光</h3>
<p>四四里戰事依然猛烈地繼績着。反軸心軍企圖擴大在里加泰，奇拉，塞拉庫　。巴基器，烏格斯泰各地所形成的橋頭堡，所以義軍司令部公報稱：軸心軍撤退安那，卡爾塔巴衆泰。反軸心軍西西里登陸戰的•標，大槪想聯絡英美二軍－在塞拉庫　—奇拉之綫以北確立大橋頭　，而於最短期間制壓全島。</p>
<p>西四里雖說是島·但不是孤島。隔四四里水道的張四拿海峽而與義大利本土相連，今日在政治上·軍事上·經濟上完全　成義大利木土的一部。而積約等於日本的四國，可稱是常X之國，世外桃源。自十二月至二月，特別有稱爲「四四里之春」的一種土俗。而且位於地中海的要衝，爲東四交通的中心點，自古即受腓尼基亞，希臘，阿拉伯，諾爾受等的勞力和影響所交錯混雜，無論從人　上說，從文化上說，給與我們和北部中部義大利完全異樣的　　的印：那　　的　光和親切的東　味，對日本人自然而然地感到一種戀鄕之念，</p>
<h3>世界聞名的馬薩拉酒</h3>
<p>今日的敎國文學，從歷史上歡察時，乃係從拉丁系統及與其並存的西四里的一布爾加萊」（一種大衆　學）發展而來，道常於東洋味的阿西里的「宮延即興詩人」，就是現代義大llJ文學的濫觴。是這種風物和環境的產物。</p>
<p>英美軍登陸的東南部一帶的地勞，和北部一帶的阿倍靑系，及以東北部的埃得納爲中心的火山系不同，是第三紀層的丘陵地帶、署召之間，遠淺而荒漢的砂浜很多。硫黃。岩鹽·石綿等鑛產物頗豐。總而言之，因受地理的環境，氣候，風圭的天惠，農產物，海產物極為豐富·碩大的　舌蘭·仙人掌·棕橺等樹·應內到處皆是·橄欖圃、橋　、葡　圓等阡陌相接。所以葡萄酒的產額亦很多，　義國是次於愛米果阿，托斯卞那而爲第三個葡萄酒座地。據傳在東部英　　陸後即　擊退的卡塔尼亞之北以埃得納爲中心的埃得納溫，及西北部敵軍賞施　制戰地方的馬　拉·以產酒著名、尤以馬薩拉酒，爲世界聞名的馬薩拉菜的調味材料。</p>
<h3>人情厚摯尙武</h3>
<p>西西里人體格均頗矮小　　眼睛均黑色　　日本人的地方很多。氣　亦帶東洋風，人　　　是麼術的，一面亦是慄悍的、寓於尙武　氣。高民協助軍隊殲滅敵軍降落　部隊的報道，即爲四四里人的這種風氣的說明。</p>
<p>勒　自古　爲四四里的首都。即在今日，人口有四十三萬九千，爲眩島弟一大都市，和人口一十五萬六千的卡塔尼亞。二十五萬五千的　四拿問爲三個代表的港口之一。半時從拿波里乘船一晚。乘飛機三小時即可到達。背倍茲萊格利諾之丘，港中的風景　繪，杜姻，愛完全　在夢中見到了東　一樣（翔　自　日新聞）</p>
<h3>上海安老院參觀記　錦綉衣被的大觀</h3>
<p>上海安老院老人們的衣被，大多數是各界捐贈的現成舊衣之類，由修女經募到院以後，立即加以悄　改裝，依各老人的身材及需要而分配，也有由中西綢布及服裝店勸募得來的零星布料，那怕一條半角，都所歡迎，消書洗熨，然後細心補綴，眞的「集腋成裘」，縫成出色的錦衣，加以藝術的修飾，顯得美觀而仍不失大方。最可愛的是老人臥室裏的錦被，就是用上述方法補綴而成的·多數還併成各種圖案花紋，綺麗極了。在嶺南各地，盛行的這種寓意祝頌的「百合被」，算是婚嫁中最隆重的禮物。我們今日那得不爲安老院的老人歡喜，但，這都是修女們的煞費苦心的結晶啊。</p>
<p>唐張二姆姆領導去男女老人各貯衣室參觀，每室都有修女姆姆負責管理，與食堂廚房相同。每室靠壁都是分格的衣櫃，每　二十格，每格一人，所有老人衣服，都爲之分別貯藏，編列名號，因爲整理者都是外國姆姆，所以巾國名字都已拼成法文了。所有衣服，分別季候，定期整洗，見有破碎，即由修女姆姆代爲修補，老人按季候每星期洗換衣服一次或數次，到了應該換衣服的日子，修女即代爲檢出，分置各人床頭。有的老人因爲行動不便，無論是男女，都得由修女代爲穿着。</p>
<p>在安老院內，特設有規模不小的洗衣處和晒臺。洗衣處有大小二間，小間專洗修女姆姆們的衣物，大間又分一般衣服洗　處及病人衣物洗濯處，各室都有自來水機，水泥特製的洗衣槽，排水溝等新式設備，龐大如火油庫的銅製消毒機，有特設的階梯，以便洗衣者上去放置及收取衣物。還有陰晾烘熨塲，絞水兼水熨的機器，據管理洗衣處的外國姆姆說，全院四百十餘人的衣服，都由姆姆們親自工作，老人中體力健康的也隨便幫忙，每星期一所洗的衣服較多，動員的洗衣人也較多，而肥皂的悄耗可眞不小，這一天幾乎要用去一百六十塊，但每月至少得化去二箱，在目前已成一大間題，希望各界樂助。</p>
<h3>夙興夜寐的畫圖</h3>
<p>好容易是夏天的黃昏時分了，吃過晚餐的老人們，已經分頭去做各人自己喜歡的「事」去了。「散心室」是老人們憇息之所，裏面有沙發藤椅，茶几，靠榻等等，老伴們三五成羣，在無憂無慮地談笑着，有的溯述過去的經歷，大有脾肉復生之感，有的在申述天主愛人和姆　們的辛苦，也有些進院不久的，在詢問院裏的故事，雖然都是些半凡的老話，但都很高興地談着，他們都向記者痛述人世的苦惱，人與人相爭的愚　，和進院後望到天國之光的喜悅。</p>
<p>散心室之外，另有吸一烟室，有些老人，啣着長烟管，悠然於北窗下，顯得非常安閒，在上海社會，這也是久矣不見的風景了。據說，老烟也是修女們向外勸募得來的，現在，所存無幾，不知還有助趣的雅士送去不？</p>
<p>在邊門院子裏納凉的老人更不少，有幾個臥病的老人，坐在特製的病人車裏，由修女姆姆們推着怡然自得。幾乎忘却了任何病痛了，老人們那裏會知道，目前公司裏，這種病人車較新式與精緻些的，已售一二萬元一輛了。</p>
<p>體力差一些的老人，已經進臥室安置了，從二一層到三層樓，共有二十五大問，每問住十四人，每人各有極精緻的單人鐵床，因為時時修整鬆漆，都和新辦的一般，第張床上，有完整淸潔的席子，毛毯，單被枕頭，和床頭的小几，放置隨身應用之物。這時，已有幾個老人斜躺着，輕搖着蒲葵　。許多老人還未入臥室，她們和他們的床上都還舖　美麗的「百合被」，令人疑是什麽富家的內室。</p>
<p>老人們夙興夜寐，都由該院修女親自扶持照　，甚至便溺等事，有時也非隨時扶持不可，至於臥室內的衣服被褥等類，　加勤於洗換，務使整齊淸潔，最令人吃　的，是　有臥室以及其他房間裏的地板，都油潤如鏡，上　大舞塲的舞池也不會更出色。難道安老院還有錢天天上蠟？姆姆說這是利用咖啡渣揩抹的結果。因為　於淸潔工作，男女老人的臥室，竟像大禮堂一樣整潔和朗爽。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>靜安寺創設助學金</h3>
<p>靜安寺爲服務社會文化，輔助學校敎育，水佛敎方便利濟旨趣，特創敎佛助學金辦法暫以資助大學及專科學校淸寒學生爲限，將來基金擴充時，再行推及於中小學，現聞該寺正籌募助學基金，積極推進助學工作。本學期起開始辦理。凡水市各大學獨立學院及事科學校之學生，具有　尊重佛敎，　學業優良，　品行端正，　家境確實淸寒者、均可向該寺申請助金，其申請手續，爲向該寺素取申請表，附交成續單及證件經該寺延請專家甄選並調查後，核准付給。該寺印有助學金設施簡章，各界可往索取云。</p>

        <h1>1943.08.03</h1>
<h3>Editorial: What Has Chongqing Recaptured? What Have Britain and America Returned?</h3>
<p>The return of the Shanghai concessions and the implementation of the agreement to abolish extraterritoriality are the results of the National Government's three-year policy of peace and a manifestation of the sincere intentions of the friendly nation of Japan toward China. Today, the people of the country must calmly observe reality, distinguish right from wrong, recognize their own position, and choose their own direction.</p>
<p>Today, we thank the friendly nation of Japan for its spirit of justice, recognize the correctness of the National Government's national policy, and look forward to the victory of the liberation and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations. However, at the same time, precisely because we are Chinese, we must not only celebrate the happy events around us, but also look out to a distant corner of our country. We are concerned about the land and compatriots under the rule of the Chongqing government, and we feel infinite regret and pain.</p>
<p>Chongqing's "War of Resistance" is said to be for the sake of striving for the liberation, independence, and freedom of the Chinese nation, and also for the sake of getting rid of the shackles of unequal treaties, so that the Republic of China can become an independent and self-reliant country in Asia. However, the war has entered its seventh year. Even if we no longer mention how great and tragic the sacrifices of the nation and the people have been, we cannot bear to talk about the serious disasters that the war has brought to the nation and East Asia. We only ask, can the promises that the Chongqing regime has given us in the past six years be fulfilled? Have the unequal treaties been completely abolished? Where is the position of independence and self-reliance? More specifically, we want to ask, what has Chongqing recaptured? What have Britain and America returned?</p>
<p>In order to deceive the people and the international community, Chongqing began negotiations with Britain and the United States in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to abolish unequal treaties and revise new treaties. For the same purpose, to deceive the Chinese people and confuse international public opinion, Britain and the United States also expressed their willingness to revise new treaties with Chongqing as early as the 30th year of the Republic of China. However, in reality, it was just thunder without rain. Britain and the United States were unwilling to give up their illegal privileges, and Chongqing did not dare to seriously demand the abolition of unequal treaties. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the power of the friendly nation of Japan swept across the Pacific Ocean, pressing westward to India and threatening America to the east, that all privileges of Britain and the United States in China practically no longer existed. Only then were the cunning British and Americans willing to be generous with other people's property and sign the so-called Sino-British and Sino-American new treaties with the Chongqing regime in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942). However, even in these nominal treaties, Britain and the United States put on airs and added temporal, regional, and other conditions and reservations. Chiang Kai-shek, in his recently published book "China's Destiny," could not help but lament that these "new treaties" still had "shortcomings." He cited the unfriendly attitude of the British authorities in not allowing discussion of the return of the Kowloon leased territory.</p>
<p>In fact, Britain and the United States have no "justice" to speak of toward Chongqing, just as they have none toward the whole of China. Even the slightest thing, like a blade of grass or a tree, they first ask whether it is beneficial to their own country. All policies are based on their own interests, privileges, and domination. Britain's unwillingness to negotiate with Chongqing on the Kowloon leased territory issue is just the most obvious example. How is the United States any different? The "Revised Chinese Exclusion Act," which has been making noise in the newspapers in Chongqing, especially in Washington, for more than a year, is such a trivial and insignificant issue, yet it has been debated for more than a year and has not yet been approved by the U.S. Congress. Is it not clear how much they despise the Chinese and look down on Chongqing? On the one hand, Britain and the United States haggle over the privileges that oppress and bind the Chinese, unwilling to give up even the smallest amount; on the other hand, they demand the highest price from Chongqing for the "new treaties," which are nominal. For example, the permanent stationing of British and American military delegations in Chongqing, the permanent stationing of American air force in the Southwest, and the exclusive appointment of advisors and technicians to all military, government, and production institutions in Chongqing, as well as internal affairs, education, and so on, all give great power to the British and Americans. This is how the Chongqing regime "joins the ranks of the four great powers"!</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are unwilling to truly give up any privilege in China, and they are strengthening their suppression of Chongqing, which they lost in the east, in order to take it from the southwest. However, Chongqing is brazen and shameless, boasting of "the realization of the abolition of unequal treaties" and "the initial success of the national revolution," indulging in delusions and dreams, in order to stir up people's hearts. In fact, the Chongqing regime has no diplomacy at all. If there is any, it is only the comedy of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen going to Britain and the United States to act. Now that Soong Mei-ling has returned to Chongqing, she still does not know how to repent. She fully exposes the spirit of Ah Q, hoping that the Soviet-Japanese war will start soon, and hoping that the United States will fully "counterattack" in the Pacific. She herself then takes the opportunity to close the door and expand her power to Qinghai and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>With such unjust and opportunistic Britain and America, and such an Ah Q-style Chongqing regime, their failure and decline are already inevitable? However, in the process of their collapse and decline, they are doing their best to create a black fog, trying to cover up the light, deceive the people, and willingly become sinners of the Chinese nation's liberation and traitors of the East Asian national revolution, in order to hinder the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new China. Half of our beautiful rivers and mountains are blackened. This is what we cannot help but feel both happy and sad about today, as we celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions and the integrity of Chinese sovereignty! On the one hand, we hope that the National Government will redouble its efforts to build a new China and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, so as to eliminate the dark clouds and shadows in our southwest and northwest as soon as possible, and restore our complete and beautiful rivers and mountains. On the other hand, we still sincerely hope that the enlightened elements in Chongqing will redouble their efforts to sweep away the darkness and return to the light together!</p>

<h3>Japan Actively Building the Co-Prosperity Sphere: Javanese People Obtain Opportunities to Participate in Politics; Harada Urges Cooperation to Complete the Mission</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency): General Harada, the highest commander of the Japanese army in Java, made a broadcast on the evening of the 1st at 8:00 PM. He explained the central policies such as the establishment of a Central Council and Councils in Java to implement political participation and enable the indigenous people to participate in politics as soon as possible. He also requested that the 50 million people be loyal to their duties and complete their assigned tasks. The gist of General Harada's broadcast is as follows: Since the Japanese army landed in Java, the 50 million Javanese people have cooperated considerably with the Japanese army's operations. The local military authorities and the Japanese government are deeply grateful for their sincerity and efforts. Therefore, it is hoped that they can move from their current activities to participate in politics. Prime Minister Tojo elucidated at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet that he permitted the Javanese people to participate in politics. Based on the government's policy and adapting to the current situation of the Java military administration, I have decided to implement this specific measure as soon as possible. Here, I explain its main points: Select local residents with noble character and far-sighted vision to set up consultation organs within the Military Administration Department to promote the smooth progress of Java's military administration. (A) Establish a Central Council in the center to advise on and convey various military administration policies. (B) Establish Councils in each state (including special cities) to advise on and convey local political affairs. (3) Select capable indigenous people from various military administration organs and place them in important positions in the military administration to promote the military administration. (A) Implement a system of participation by the Central Military Administration Supervision Department so that local residents with high knowledge and experience can directly participate in the deliberation of various departments' policies, etc. (B) Appoint local residents to the state and other military administration organs to undertake the implementation of military administration duties. If the Javanese residents can devote all their efforts and responsibilities to this new task and contribute greatly to the Greater East Asia War to gain the trust of the Japanese government, the Japanese government will always grant them a greater scope of activity. Regarding the above, I sincerely hope that all local residents will deeply understand my true intentions and rise up to complete their new mission.</p>
<p>Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency): After General Harada, the highest commander of the military, issued a statement regarding the participation of Javanese indigenous leaders in the war, the indigenous people all expressed their welcome. The gist of their opinions is as follows: Whenever Britain and the United States are in dire straits in their own countries, they tend to appease their colonies, but they always go back on their word afterwards. This is their usual trick. However, Japan, in its glorious victory, resolutely implements its unwavering policies, which fully demonstrates the Japanese government's true intentions to establish a co-prosperity sphere. After Japan occupied the Dutch East Indies, it completely eliminated the 350 years of rule of the old Dutch East Indies government in a short period of 350 days, raised the banner of building a new Java, and quickly expressed Japan's enthusiasm for liberating Asian nations and building a co-prosperity sphere. The statement issued by the highest Japanese commander this time shows that the fundamental concept of establishing a co-prosperity sphere and building a new Java is based on the spirit of serving and practicing, and indicates the direction for local residents to cooperate in achieving victory in the war. The content of the Japanese supreme commander's statement on the political participation of indigenous people this time is the first step in implementing Tojo's statement. The cooperative attitude of the central and local governments towards political participation is about to be prepared. Local residents have great hope and expectations for the authorities.</p>
<h3>Myanmar's Long-Cherished Wish for Independence Has Been Fulfilled: Prime Minister Tojo's Speech; Japan Will Still Provide Full Support to Enable the New Myanmar to Complete its Great Revival</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency): Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement on the independence of Myanmar on the 1st, the gist of which is as follows: "Today, Myanmar declares its independence and declares war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Empire shall immediately recognize the State of Myanmar and conclude a treaty of alliance with it. Looking back, Myanmar has been seeking independence for a long time, but has suffered greatly under British suppression. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the brave fighting of the Japanese military, the British and American forces were driven out of Myanmar in a short time, and the internal and external situation of Myanmar was completely changed as a result. Since then, the great cause of Myanmar's revival has progressed rapidly. Myanmar's long-cherished wish has been fulfilled only a year and a half since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which is a historical commemorative day for Myanmar's independence. In addition to feeling grateful for the great grace, I also deeply congratulate the State of Myanmar. After our army began operations in Myanmar, U Ba Maw and other Burmese patriots inherited the legacy of the Burmese martyrs and worked hard to strive for independence, wholeheartedly cooperating with our army in the war. They worked day and night to strive for Myanmar's independence and carry out the Greater East Asia War. Among them, many loyal and brave soldiers of our army died on the battlefield, and many Burmese warriors faithfully martyred themselves. Here, I deeply admire the great achievements of the many martyrs who died for Myanmar's independence, and I deeply respect the efforts and cooperation of U Ba Maw and the Burmese people in creating Myanmar and assisting our army. At the same time, I also deeply respect the wonderful achievements of our soldiers in fighting in Myanmar, and I respectfully express my condolences to the soldiers of our army and the Burmese warriors who died on the battlefield. The Burmese people have gained the glory of being citizens of an independent country from today onwards, which can be said to be an honor. It is not easy for a country to develop smoothly after independence. Therefore, the Burmese people should work even harder to seek the smooth development of Myanmar in the future, and it goes without saying that the Empire will continue to provide comprehensive support for the prosperity of the State of Myanmar. Now that Myanmar has gained independence, the goals of the Greater East Asia War are also gradually being achieved. However, if the Greater East Asia War does not achieve final victory, the liberation of Greater East Asia cannot be completed. Therefore, we must know that there are still many difficulties ahead in the Greater East Asia War, but any difficulty must be overcome and any obstacle must be overcome. We will definitely be able to achieve victory under the expectations of the people, and this is also our country's glorious tradition. Today, the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is even more consolidated, and the total strength of Greater East Asia has been fully exerted. We are full of fighting spirit to complete the Greater East Asia War, and the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia have united to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the future of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia can be said to be full of infinite light.</p>
<h3>Japan Appoints Isomura as Military Attaché to Myanmar</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Japanese Army Ministry announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Isomura as Military Attaché to the Japanese Embassy in Myanmar.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement: The Nations of Greater East Asia are Becoming More United, and Their Determination to Destroy Britain and America is Growing Stronger</h3>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: Foreign Minister Chu issued the following statement yesterday regarding the independence of Myanmar: Myanmar has been subjugated and poisoned by British imperialism for a long time. Today, we are able to see the independence of this nation, and we would like to express our deep joy from the standpoint of an East Asian comrade. In particular, the territories of China and Myanmar are adjacent, and their past relationship has been very close. Since 1886, the Qing government was forced to recognize the British regime in Myanmar. Today, Myanmar has broken away from British control and become an independent and free country. Our heartfelt congratulations cannot be expressed in words.</p>
<p>Since the British aggressive forces surged eastward, India and Myanmar were the first to suffer the poison. The vicious means and cruel methods used by Britain in India were also applied to Myanmar in the same way. For a hundred years, we have also suffered from British aggression and oppression. Therefore, if we want to revive East Asia, we must first eliminate Britain and America.</p>
<p>The Burmese people deeply understand the great righteousness. Since the allied Japanese forces pacified Myanmar, under the guidance of the wise Chief Administrator U Ba Maw, they have united as one, cooperated with the allied nations, and devoted themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. That is, in the construction of Greater East Asia, they have devoted themselves to the creation and active efforts of a new Myanmar, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The allied nation of Japan has organized a preparatory committee for the independence of Myanmar with the support of the Burmese people in East Asia, and has been actively preparing for independence. Recently, the allied Prime Minister of Japan, Tojo, expressed Japan's fervent hope for Myanmar in the Diet, which shows the allied nation's sincerity in earnestly desiring Myanmar's independence. The Burmese people have finally realized their independence through their own efforts and the assistance of the allied nations. It is firmly believed that after Myanmar's independence, other nations still under the oppression of Britain and America will be deeply encouraged, rise up to fight, and see that the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia will become more united because of Myanmar's independence, and their determination to destroy their old enemies, Britain and America, is beyond doubt. Today, we are delighted to hear of Myanmar's independence, and in addition to expressing our deep congratulations to the Burmese people, we are also overjoyed at the future of Greater East Asian construction. Today, Myanmar's independence coincides with the date of our country's receiving of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Shanghai International Settlement was the largest stronghold of British and American aggression in East Asia, and in the past, Myanmar was the outpost of British and American aggression in East Asia. Now that they have both been restored to the hands of East Asians, it is truly the end of British and American power in East Asia. However, the British and Americans are still acting foolishly and have not yet stopped. In order to protect this already liberated East Asia, we must unite as one with our allied nation Japan and work together to achieve the goals of the war and complete the great cause of East Asian co-prosperity. It is believed that the entire 1 billion people of East Asia must also share this determination.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces in Sicily Hold Firmly to Fortified Positions</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to a report from London citing "Exchange Telegraph," fighting has begun on the entire front line of 100 kilometers from Catania to Santo Stefano. A new bridgehead has been built on the opposite bank of the Leos River.</p>
<p>Bern, 2nd (Central News Agency): The battle of Sicily has entered its fourth week, and the Allied forces are still being blocked by the strong resistance of the Axis forces. The enemy is advancing at a rate of feet or yards in the four inland areas, while in the eastern sector, they are still being blocked in front of Catania. The German and Italian troops have well-covered trenches and a strong base in Messina in the northeast, which can protect the Strait of Messina. If the enemy forces occupy that place, they can smoothly enter the Italian mainland. Reuters also acknowledged that the American forces in the four areas are now in a difficult position, and the strengthening of the Axis forces' resistance can be proven by the fact that the American forces are stagnating in the Santo Stefano area.</p>

<h3>Establishing a Central Ideology and Building a Central Force: "The Most Important Task in Constructing New Shanghai" Chairman Wang's Remarks to Reporters</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Shanghai Xing Yuan at 4:00 PM on the second day, making the following remarks: Last September, when I was inspecting the rural areas, I passed through Shanghai and met with you all. In another month, it will be a year. I am very pleased to see you all again today.</p>
<p>Last time we met, I spoke mainly about the issue of rural pacification. Now, the recovery of the two concession areas in Shanghai has been successfully realized thanks to the good offices of our friendly nation, Japan, and the good intentions of France and Italy. Therefore, I feel another kind of pleasure in meeting you all today.</p>
<p>What I wanted to say has already been published in yesterday's broadcast address and the speech at the People's Representative Assembly. I don't want to repeat myself today. I originally just wanted to hear your opinions today and did not intend to express anything myself. This morning, I happened to receive letters from several gentlemen raising the question of "What is the most important task that should be started first in building New Shanghai?" Although this is not the opinion of all of you, since there is this question, I would like to give an answer to it.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important thing in building New Shanghai is to establish a central ideology and build a central force. Why? I will explain it in three points:</p>
<p>Eliminating Old Concession Traces to Find a Common Ground</p>
<p>First, in the past, Shanghai was partly Chinese, partly the International Settlement, and partly the French Concession. Although the International Settlement has been taken over by friendly nations since the Greater East Asia War, the traces of the concessions have not yet been completely eliminated. These three areas have different positions, which naturally leads to differences in ideology. Now that they are to be merged, the most important thing is to find a common ground. Therefore, there must be a central ideology and a central force to make the three different areas become one.</p>
<p>Clarifying Different Views and Defending Against Ideological Toxins</p>
<p>Second, Shanghai has five million people, and their economic, cultural, educational, and ideological thoughts are extremely complex. It is undeniable that various different views exist at the same time. If purely negative methods are used to prohibit them and prevent them from appearing in writing, it will be ineffective. Even if they are asked to say what we want them to say, it will be ineffective if it does not come from the heart. If we want to achieve uniformity immediately, it will not be easy. Therefore, we must establish a central ideology and build a central force to be able to lead. As a hub, the center still maintains its position as a transportation station for both external and internal affairs. This kind of place is most easily attacked and disturbed by toxic thoughts. If a central ideology is not established and a central force is not built, the power of ideological warfare, both externally and internally, will be insufficient.</p>
<p>Striving for Victory in the War as the Only Way Out</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that the first and most important task in building New Shanghai is to establish a central ideology and build a central force. Then how can we establish a central ideology and build a central force? I believe that we should affirm our belief in the Greater East Asia War and recognize that there is no second way out for China other than striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War. We deeply know that what China can contribute to the Greater East Asia War now is only to ensure social order and increase production. But even to achieve these two points, we must first establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War. The past purpose of rural pacification work was to expand peace, but now it is to maintain the social order in the rear of the Greater East Asia War and increase production. The past purpose was to improve the economic life of the people, but now it is to increase the power to contribute to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Consuming for War and Producing for War</p>
<p>Speaking of increasing production, some people may find it laughable. They think that production cannot even be discussed today, so what is there to talk about increasing production? However, in times of war, we must constantly consume on one hand and constantly produce on the other. Consumption is for the Greater East Asia War, and production is also for the Greater East Asia War. Only in this way can we determine the purpose of production. In short, the people must first have enthusiasm for participating in the Greater East Asia War in order to save consumption and increase production. How can we inspire the Chinese people, especially the people of Shanghai, with enthusiasm for the Greater East Asia War? We must establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War and a belief that China has no second way out other than striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Only in this way can strength arise from belief.</p>
<p>Eliminating Aggressive Forces and Ensuring Local Security</p>
<p>It is the same for ensuring social order and increasing production as it is for ideology. For example, why should we eliminate the toxic thoughts of Britain and the United States? Because Britain and the United States are enemies of East Asia. If we can actively establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War, then on the negative side, we will certainly be able to eliminate the toxins of Anglo-American aggressive thought.</p>
<p>There are many things to be done in building New Shanghai, such as ensuring social order, increasing production, and eliminating the toxic thoughts of Britain and the United States. However, the focus of work should be on establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The significance of this New Citizen Movement in holding summer training camps for young people and civil servants lies in this. Summer training is most difficult to manage and is prone to epidemics. The reason why young people and civil servants are being called for training during the summer is not because the summer was specially selected. After the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War on January 9, preparations for the training were immediately made. The preparations were completed just in time for the summer. The first phase of training was held in Nanjing last month, and the second phase is in Shanghai. The purpose of the training is to establish a belief in the Greater East Asia War and enable them to exert their strength in the Greater East Asia War. Although there are only five or six hundred people receiving training this time, the government's goal is to start with a small number of young people and civil servants and gradually expand and popularize it in Shanghai and the whole country. In this way, Shanghai can establish a central ideology and build a central force.</p>
<p>Myanmar's Prime Minister Ba Maw's Remarks are Truly Admirable</p>
<p>A reporter from a friendly nation asked: How much strength does China have to participate in the Greater East Asia War? Are we exaggerating and being conceited? I believe that strength is important, but establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War is the most important thing, because strength can only arise from belief. Therefore, today, we must base ourselves on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of Pan-Asianism, and then, based on the successive official statements of the friendly Imperial Government to unite and end Asia, establish our belief. Myanmar's Prime Minister Ba Maw gave a speech saying: "Myanmar was founded in war, born in war, and exists in war." I deeply admire Prime Minister Ba Maw's guidance and the direction of the Myanmar people.</p>
<p>After the National Government joined the war, it put forward the slogan of "Sharing Life and Death." This is not empty talk. We must share life and death internally and also share life and death with friendly nations. Without the determination to share death, we cannot obtain the destiny of sharing life.</p>
<p>Enduring Unavoidable Suffering with Courage</p>
<p>I have a few more words to say to domestic reporters. We must take establishing a belief in the Greater East Asia War as the central goal of our discourse. This is true not only for news but also for supplements. I also know that newspaper editors cannot be monotonous and must add other flavors for adjustment. Complexity is fine, but there cannot be contradictory phenomena in the discourse and thoughts of the same newspaper. We should sympathize with the groans arising from the hardship of economic life and the dissatisfaction with individual freedom. However, the most important thing is that suffering that can be avoided, such as that caused by poor administrative methods or unsound economic organizations, should be resolved as much as possible. If the suffering is unavoidable in the war, then the people should be encouraged to endure it with courage, just like the soldiers on the front lines who are stained with blood, enduring hardships while remaining silent.</p>
<p>In short, we must recognize what is lacking and what is needed in building New Shanghai, and do our best to do it. In a complex place like Shanghai, the first and most important thing is to establish a central ideology for the Greater East Asia War and concentrate our strength to shoulder the responsibilities that China should fulfill in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Short Commentary: How to Build New Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang met with the press in this city yesterday and made a speech. After carefully reading it, we would like to offer our humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>First, Chairman Wang said that the most important thing in building New Shanghai is to "establish a central ideology and build a central force." We should support this. It can even be said that the purpose of this central ideology and central force is to unite the people and the government, and the content is that the government leads from above and the people assist from below to build New Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, establishing a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War is absolutely necessary. However, we believe that to establish a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War, we must first establish a belief in peace. We have said that among the general public, especially party and government personnel, in the peace zone, except for a few leaders, many do not have a firm enough belief in peace, and therefore their belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War is weak. This should be corrected.</p>
<p>Third, if the people cannot endure the pain of economic life, it is indeed because they have not established a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War. The Chairman told us that we should endure the suffering that is unavoidable in war with courage. This is also what we should accept. For example, in wartime, we should abide by wartime laws, fulfill wartime obligations, economize on food and clothing, and endure hardship. However, much of the current suffering can be avoided. One of the most obvious examples is the high price of goods. Japan and various parts of Southeast Asia are also in wartime, but their price increases are limited and reasonable. This proves that our situation is more special. The Chairman also said that avoidable suffering, such as that caused by poor administrative methods and unsound economic organizations, should be resolved as much as possible. We believe that simply adjusting the economic system and economic laws is not enough to resolve the economic crisis, and that administrative methods must be absolutely rational and good to truly resolve the people's economic suffering. This is also a powerful factor in strengthening the belief in peace and further establishing a belief in victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Kosyrev Succeeds as Soviet Ambassador to the UK</h3>
<p>Moscow, 1st (Central News Agency) - Officials here confirmed tonight that Soviet Minister to Canada, Kosyrev, will succeed Maisky as Ambassador to the UK.

He was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow in 1937.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the transfer of Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, to the position of Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Kim, said: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently needs Maisky's assistance in the work of Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov is now assigned by Stalin to focus on military affairs and is overwhelmed. Therefore, Maisky will do his best to handle diplomatic affairs.

<h3>Guangtian, Chief of the Reporting Section, Talks About the War Aims of the Axis Powers: Based on Moral Aspirations</h3>
<p>Guangtian, Chief of the Reporting Section of the Japanese Embassy Office, stated at a reception for foreign journalists on the second day that the war aims of the Axis powers were based on moral aspirations, while what the Allies had in mind was purely to</p>
<p>Control the World</p>
<p>Chief Guangtian stated: Japan has already returned the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1st and recognized the independence of Myanmar. Both of these things show Japan's enthusiasm and sincerity for the independence and freedom of the nations of East Asia. Because of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, there are no longer any concessions on Chinese territory. This gives great assistance to China's efforts to complete its independence. In addition, the guarantee of Myanmar's independence has been negotiated by officials such as Chief Ba Maw since last August, which took about a year to realize. The above two facts are Japan's policies towards the two nations of China and Myanmar. However, this can be understood as only part of Japan's long-planned Greater East Asia policy. The so-called</p>
<p>East Asian Order</p>
<p>, an abstract term, can be expressed most concretely by the above two events. It can also be seen from this that the policies advocated by the Japanese government will be put into practice. We can point out from these two points how sincere and substantive Japan's war aims and attitudes towards policy are compared to those of Britain and the United States. In short, the war aims of the anti-Axis powers are to maintain the status quo of the British Empire and are nothing more than an attempt to use American totalitarianism to dominate the world. The war aims of Britain and the United States are to overthrow Nazism and Fascism in the world and to destroy the current political organizations of Germany and Italy. However, considering their actual actions, it is clear that they are attempting to</p>
<p>Completely Destroy</p>
<p>the national political organizations of Germany and Italy. But why do Britain and the United States especially target the people of these three countries as enemies? This is because these three countries are powerful countries that resist Anglo-American dominance of the world. What they seek is to divide the more than fifty countries in the world and make them oppose each other, while Britain and the United States exert their political strategies in the meantime in order to maintain their country's power to dominate the world. However, the countries that have cultivated the strength to resist their political strategies and have emerged from World War I are Germany, Italy, and Japan. In other words, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy are fighting for the independence and freedom of more than half of the world's 2 billion people, while Britain and the United States are planning to first defeat these two countries and then</p>
<p>Divide the Nations</p>
<p>This statement is neither an exaggeration nor an intentional accusation against Britain and the United States. Recalling how Britain and the United States have pursued their policies in the past, and observing the Paris Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, and the policies of the League of Nations afterwards, one can see it at a glance. During that time, the various countries were extremely constrained and impoverished by Britain and the United States. These are all historical facts. Also, in East Asia, since the situation after the Washington Conference, there is only one way to counter Anglo-American dominance of the world. This is the new world order that Japan, Germany, and Italy advocate to build. And its foundation is nothing more than to prevent Britain and the United States from dominating the world, and that more than fifty other countries should be closely linked politically, culturally, and spiritually to confront Anglo-American dominance. There is no other way. If we want to prevent the hunger and poverty of various countries from providing for the extravagant lives of British and American people, then the only way is to build a new world order. The two countries of Britain and the United States hold very lofty ideals for the aims of the war. Although they say it is for the sake of the</p>
<p>Freedom and Independence</p>
<p>of all nations, if so, why not give India the independence that Japan has given to Myanmar? Japan will also grant independence to the Philippines in the near future, but although the United States promised to grant independence to the Philippines in the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1936, it has not yet been implemented. Also, Britain and the United States have expressed the so-called four freedoms as war aims, and of course we do not trust them at all. In fact, have they ever implemented any of them in the past? Recently, they have treated the Atlantic Charter as waste paper and promised to make Poland independent and secure but ultimately broke their promise. If we recall the past, Wilson once outlined fourteen points to bring about the collapse of Germany, followed by harsh conditions like the Treaty of Paris imposed on it. This kind of fact is the opposite of Japan's attitude of returning the Shanghai International Settlement as scheduled on August 1 and recognizing Myanmar's independence. Therefore, what needs to be paid attention to at this moment is to recognize</p>
<p>The Enemy's Face</p>
<p>When they are close to your country, they always use sweet words, but once another country does not follow them, they suddenly turn their faces. If we pay attention to them using sweet words that they do not act on to approach us, this is the enemy's plot to destroy the unity of our countries and the alliance between the Axis powers. In short, our aim in building a new world order is to be in line with the justice of all mankind in the world. But the aim of Britain and the United States is nothing more than a new ambition to control the world. Therefore, the only thing necessary for us now is to have a firm determination to carry out the war. Fight until the final victory and then stop.</p>

<p>Starting from August 1 of this year (i.e., the 32nd school year), 44 municipal primary schools in the seven districts of Nanhui, Beiqiao, Chuansha, Chongming, Baoshan, Jiading, and Fengxian have been officially transferred to the respective special district public offices for management and renamed district schools. This is a measure taken by the Municipal Education Bureau in relation to the district political structure and to make the facilities and management of primary education in the city more rational.</p>
<h3>Coffins in Shanghai Public Cemetery Moved to First Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>Due to the necessity of Shanghai Public Cemetery's land for military use, a deadline for relocation has been set, which has been announced and handled by the Municipal Health Bureau. It is learned that the Shanghai First Public Cemetery in front of the Jiangqing Gaojing Temple has been designated as the place for the relocation of Shanghai Public Cemetery. All coffins that have not been moved out of Shanghai Public Cemetery will be moved to the First Public Cemetery, and the Health Bureau has ordered the Shanghai Public Cemetery to be responsible for handling all relocation matters.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Merchants Refuse to Sell Cigarettes, Allotments Will Be Cancelled</h3>
<p>Recently, rumors have been circulating in the city that cigarette price limits will soon be implemented, and many cigarette retailers have a tendency to hoard and refuse to sell. To clarify the truth, a reporter visited the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association. According to reports, although the raw materials and labor costs of manufactured cigarettes have soared, the ideal of cigarette price limits will inevitably be affected. However, at this time, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are determining to cancel qualifications.</p>

<h3>Football Match to Celebrate the Reception of the Concession: Three Provinces Defeat Western Union, Minister Chu Attends to Give a Speech, Mayor Chen Kicks Off, Charity Ball Sold by Mr. Li Songling for 70,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The charity football match for scholarship funds organized by the Three Provinces Sports Association to celebrate the National Government's recovery of the concession was held yesterday at 6:00 PM in a enthusiastic atmosphere at the Yi Qiuchang Stadium. The Three Provinces team played against the Western Union team. As a result, the Three Provinces team came from behind and won 2-1. More than 10,000 spectators, whose names were on the wall as donors, watched the game, and the scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>The Opening Ceremony Was Held Solemnly</p>
<p>When the time came, the conference opened the curtain amidst the cheers and support of tens of thousands of spectators in the stadium. The military music of the national anthem, with everyone standing at attention, resounded throughout the conference venue. Then Minister Chu gave an opening speech, which was very encouraging. Then Mayor Chen kicked off the ball, and the game began.</p>
<p>Western Union's Offense Was Strong in the First Half</p>
<p>Western Union started to attack, but it was blocked by Gao Zhiwen into a corner kick. The Three Provinces team immediately counterattacked. Sun Lao Jin got a ball from Song Lingsheng and was about to strike from the bottom, but Oliveira rushed back from the front to save the situation and shoveled hard, causing Lao Sun to lose his effort. Soon after, Sun Lao Jin opened a corner kick towards the gate, but it was also caught by G Suro and became nothing. The Three Provinces attacked many times, but all failed to capture the city. On the contrary, the Western Union had a turnaround. Oliveira broke out of the crowd and passed to A Corassa from afar. Corassa hooked it from the baseline, and Carlole rushed forward and headed it in. Gao Zhiwen was not prepared for this cold arrow, and the ball went straight into the net, giving Western Union a 1-0 lead. The Three Provinces were unwilling to show weakness and launched a counterattack, but all failed to achieve success. Looking back at the Western Union, the offense was still weaving, but the Three Provinces defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng defended well and turned the danger into safety. Soon after, the first half ended, and the Three Provinces temporarily suffered a loss due to this one goal.</p>
<p>Minister Ding Presided Over the Charity Ball Auction</p>
<p>During the break, Minister Ding Diancun auctioned off the charity ball, and the competition was very enthusiastic. The auction price broke the new record for charity ball auctions. The auction price also continued to rise sharply because of the fierce competition. At the last moment, when Xia Shikui raised the price to 65,000 yuan, Li Songling also did not want to be left behind and bought it at the highest price of 70,000 yuan. His benevolence and righteousness are deeply admired.</p>
<p>As a Result, Three Provinces Won 2-1</p>
<p>After the charity ball was auctioned off, the two sides reorganized their troops and fought again. The Three Provinces changed their strategy and it worked. After ten minutes, Qu Yongfu intercepted the ball from Carlole, and with a sword he split W Pantuo Xun and two passes, rushing forward. Oliveira tried to save the situation in a hurry, but he mistakenly committed a handball at 24 yards. Sun Lao Jin took the penalty kick, and with his extraordinary iron legs, he scored in one fell swoop. The score was 1-1, and the two sides drew. Then the battle between the two teams became more intense, and the spectators in the stadium cheered for the Three Provinces to support them and to show their spirit for China. At this time of national celebration and jubilation, when the concession was received, the cornerstone of victory for our great Chinese nation was laid forever. The Three Provinces soldiers lived up to the expectations of the public, and then the three armies used their lives. With their right-flank right-thrusts and five-way pincer attacks, Fei Chunhua came from the border, fell in front of the enemy's door, and Zhou Defa waited for the right moment and gently pushed it, and it was reported to be in. The score was 2-1, and the Three Provinces came from behind. At this point, the audience cheered and waved their handkerchiefs and hats, and the sound of firecrackers continued to echo in the sky above Yi Qiu. Soon after, time ran out, and the Three Provinces immediately celebrated their victory with this precious goal.</p>
<p>Minister Zhou's Daughter Gave the Awards</p>
<p>After the game, Minister Zhou Cai's daughter presented the awards. The Three Provinces team captain Fei Chunhua, amidst the joy and cheers of the crowd, received the trophy from Miss Zhou. As for the second game, it is scheduled to be held at the same location on the 6th of this month (this Friday). The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen and the Governor of Tokyo Exchange Radio Speeches: "After a Century of Humiliation from Concessions, We Now Receive the Cooperation of Friendly Nations to Return Them. We Deeply Hope that Economics and Culture Will Be United in the Future, and Law and Justice Will Be United."</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai have been returned to our country one after another, Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Chen Gongbo expressed deep gratitude for the cooperation of friendly nation Japan. On the afternoon of the 2nd, from 10:00 to 10:35, he exchanged radio broadcasts with Tokyo Governor Odate Takeo at the Greater Shanghai Broadcasting Station. The original text of Mayor Chen's radio speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To His Excellency Odate, Governor of Tokyo:</p>
<p>Today, just after the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement and the final French Concession, exchanging radio broadcasts with Your Excellency makes me feel deeply fortunate and joyful. I firmly believe that Your Excellency shares the same sense of honor and joy with me.</p>
<p>This time, China's recovery of all foreign concessions in China is truly grateful for the cooperation of your country. Recalling that on the day your country joined the Greater East Asia War in China, your country officially declared the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions. Subsequently, on March 29th, the anniversary of the National Government's relocation to Nanjing, your country took the lead in returning its concession. Moreover, it cooperated with other countries in returning concessions and the International Settlement. This courageous act fully demonstrates the spirit of the East and the friendship between China and Japan. The foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the everlasting friendship between China and Japan can also be established through this.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement has been around for a century, and the decline of China's international status has also been for a century. This humiliation is not only China's humiliation but also the common humiliation of the East Asian nations. This time, thanks to your country's cooperation, the concessions have been recovered in one stroke, allowing China to achieve its independence and freedom. This is not only China's glory but also the common glory of the East Asian nations.</p>
<p>In the past, due to the establishment of concessions, Shanghai produced endless evils. Although the economy was prosperous, economics and culture were not united. Although laws existed, law and justice were not united. In other words, as long as the Shanghai concessions existed, there would be only economy without culture and only law without justice. From now on, with the recovery of the concessions, Shanghai can not only unify its administration, but I also hope to unite economics and culture, unite law and justice, and make Shanghai a city of Eastern civilization, comparable to your country's Tokyo.</p>
<p>We are currently considering and planning the future development of Greater Shanghai. For all construction, we are not only studying how to revitalize it but also how to make it more developed. Regarding public security, we are not only striving to maintain it but also striving to establish it, so that the rear of the Greater East Asia War will always be safe. We are also studying how to increase the welfare of the citizens, especially striving to protect the overseas Chinese of your country, in order to achieve the goal of common effort and common progress between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become a major military base in the rear, which is mutually recognized by our two countries. Based on our unwavering belief, we must enable this major supply depot to continue production and continue supply, so that the productivity of the citizens is linked to the victory of the war, and the various aspects of the city are also improved with the victory of the war. I hope that your country's government and the people of your country in Shanghai will understand this intention and give us greater cooperation.</p>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of your country and a world-renowned metropolis. In terms of municipal facilities and construction scale, it can serve as a model for Shanghai in every aspect. I hope that Your Excellency will provide guidance on Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<p>Tokyo and Shanghai are two extremely large cities in the East and are even more like brothers in spirit. They can be called the major centers of economic cooperation and cultural exchange in the East. In the future, our exchanges will be closer, and our strength will be even greater. I hope that Your Excellency will use your academic background and experience to provide Shanghai with assistance.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to have exchanged broadcasts with Your Excellency today. I sincerely wish for the common development of China and Japan, the common development of Greater East Asia and Greater Shanghai, and respectfully wish Your Excellency good health and the citizens of Greater Tokyo happiness.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Elementary School Entrance Exam Continues Yesterday; Teachers Are Requested to Grade Test Papers, and the Approved List Will Be Announced Around the 10th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shen Bao Fifth Readers' Scholarship, Junior Elementary School Grades One and Two entrance exam, continued yesterday afternoon at the YMCA Middle School. Excluding a portion of new and old applicant students who were notified of exemption from the exam, over a thousand students participated, divided into eight classrooms simultaneously.

<p>A Glimpse of the Elementary School Entrance Exam</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM, the students began to arrive one after another. Because of their young age, most were accompanied by their parents, resulting in an especially large crowd. The parents' waiting room and corridors were overflowing. Fortunately, the YMCA Student Service Department had dispatched personnel to assist the students in finding their seats and guiding them to their places, maintaining good order. The exam started on time, and after the distribution of test papers, the students immediately immersed themselves in writing, exerting their best efforts to answer, hoping to achieve the goal of receiving assistance.

<p>New Capital Hotel Employees Scholarship</p>
<p>Considering the large number of out-of-school youth and the severity of the disaster situation in North China, the employees of the New Capital Hotel unanimously embraced the principle of "doing good is the greatest joy." On July 29th, the hotel's anniversary, they initiated a campaign to donate a percentage of their salaries to support scholarships and disaster relief. Manager Mr. Li Jinying matched the employees' contributions, and the company authorities also donated an equal amount to the total, resulting in a total of 13,207.50 yuan. Of this, 3,207.50 yuan was donated to disaster relief in North China, and 10,000 yuan was donated to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship. The New Capital Hotel is a leader in the restaurant industry, and all its employees embrace the service spirit of "satisfying customers." Their efforts in assisting out-of-school youth and caring for disaster victims are particularly admirable.</p>
<p>All Sectors Show Concern for Impoverished Students</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Xiang Sheng Hotel held a charity sale on August 1st, donating half of its total sales revenue of 5,740 yuan to the scholarship fund. In addition, Mr. Wang Shouqi of Juyuan Velvet and Cotton Fabric Store firmly declined the gifts sent by friends and relatives for his late father's 70th birthday and instead donated 500 yuan to the scholarship fund.

<h3>Commentary: Shanghai's Economy After the Recovery of the Concessions</h3>
<p>The year of "a century of hardship turns to a morning of spring" has brought about "a century for the return of concessions!"</p>
<p>Since August 1st, concessions have disappeared from all of China, and grand celebrations have already been held. Now, let's talk about Shanghai's economy after the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<p>Citizens of the former concessions after the recovery of the concessions need not worry about a lack of reliable security for their livelihoods and properties. Such thinking is undesirable. The number of Chinese people living in the concessions is only five or six million, while the number living outside the concessions is eight or nine times greater. May I ask, are the lives and properties of these eighty times more Chinese people as precarious as a reflection in the water? Qingdao has no concessions, Suzhou and Hangzhou have no concessions, and Shaoxing has no concessions. Can anyone say that the safety of the lives and properties of the residents in these places is not as good as the former Shanghai concessions? Since lives and properties are not a problem, the prosperity of Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions will at least be able to maintain its past prosperity.</p>
<p>Shanghai's past prosperity, in addition to its natural geographical advantages, also depended on artificial political and diplomatic advantages. Now that the artificial advantages have been swept away, the opportunity for its expanded prosperity must be shared equally with other cities in the country in the future and should no longer be monopolized. This is another point that the citizens of Shanghai should recognize. Shanghai suffers from a "tumor of wealth," while the inland suffers from a "disease of selling blood." Both are hurt and are pitiful and painful. From now on, this disease and this tumor may be mutually regulated, and both may recover.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's prosperity only extended to the concessions. In the future, Shanghai's prosperity will naturally extend to the suburbs and nearby cities, allowing the population and capital of the concessions to gradually disperse and allowing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to develop evenly. This is indeed the most reasonable economic change after the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in the City After the Recovery of the Concessions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and also the first day of market resumption (because the previous day happened to be a Sunday holiday). Due to the circumstances, the general public paid unusual attention to the market conditions and the new situations that might occur in the future. The general situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Market is Peaceful and Stable, and Prices are Stable</p>
<p>In the past, the old concession areas of Shanghai had a special environment that attracted speculative merchants to gather for profit. Thus, it became a major base for floating capital and stockpiled goods. Before the recovery of the concessions, the responsible authorities began to take effective measures to control stockpiling and suppress prices, sparing no effort. Therefore, during the recovery of the concessions, the market opened yesterday morning with stability as usual, and prices did not fluctuate drastically. The trends in various markets all showed a calm situation. For example, the stock, gold, and silver markets were peaceful, with only small price fluctuations. Government bonds, on the other hand, had fallen back. The cotton cloth market showed a slight loosening, while cotton yarn remained sluggish with stable prices. Other industries were also in a normal state.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation Continues</p>
<p>Moreover, before the recovery of the concessions, the Public Works Department and the Materials Investigation Committee made extraordinary efforts to thoroughly investigate stockpiling and crack down on the black market. After the recovery of the concessions, the government authorities will continue to work with relevant parties to crack down on the black market and thoroughly investigate stockpiling in the First and Eighth Districts. In the short term, large-scale investigation work will be launched again. As for the inspection of financial institutions, it will also be intensified in the future to ensure that there are no illegal activities in the operations of financial institutions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Riping Talks About Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Chen Riping, the director of the Economic Affairs Department of the First District of the Shanghai Special Municipality, officially reported to the district office yesterday (the 2nd). A reporter from the Central News Agency paid a special visit yesterday and was honored to receive his remarks. The main points are recorded below: In today's wartime, manpower and resources are inevitably consumed, and the movement and exchange of materials are inevitably hindered. Moreover, inflation after the war is one of the reasons for the rise in prices, which is also unavoidable. The current situation in Shanghai is actually abnormal. There is too much floating capital that is not engaged in production. Whether they are merchants or not, everyone stockpiles goods to seek profit. Moreover, the stockpiled goods are mostly necessities for daily life, which harms people's livelihoods and oppresses the public. I hope that financial institutions and those with capital will not lend money to stockpile goods. If there are any, they should be recovered and invested in production or saved to replenish the funds for production. Then, those who borrow money to stockpile goods will have to sell their stockpiled goods at the cost of their capital and profit. If this is done, the price surge may be curbed. At the same time, the people should take self-defense measures and report crimes so that the authorities have a basis to adopt severe penalties to deter others. This is a temporary solution for the current situation. We should work together to engage in production. If there is a shortage of raw materials or fuel, we should conserve them in light of the current situation and overcome the difficulties together to seek change gradually. The municipal authorities should also make every effort to save expenses, strengthen production, and ensure rationing so that the people do not panic, thereby preventing the activities of the black market. This is a fundamental solution.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market fluctuated and turned weak. Although there was news of loosening restrictions on stocks, people's hearts inevitably turned fearful amid the decline in various markets. The desire to cash in profits increased, and after a long rise, the buying power was also not weak. Although most stocks saw small squeezes, only a small portion saw gains and new highs. Small-denomination textile stocks and industrial stocks were particularly favored by investors. Yong'an Company in the department store industry also saw new prices, but eventually retreated into the close, showing a slight squeeze. Xinxin and Guohuo Companies rose slightly in a roundabout way. Nei Yi saw a slight setback, while Jingfu Shirt surged again. Jinglun also broke out two levels. Yong'an Textile Machinery in the textile industry fluctuated by hundreds, falling slightly after rising. Hongshen, Meilun, Xinfeng, Zhenfeng, Rongfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, and other small-denomination stocks continued to rise. Da Zhonghua Weaving created another level. The rumor of Da Sheng's capital increase was confirmed, and the price jumped. Wen Hua, Shangwu, and Zhonghua remained stagnant at the previous prices. Shijie saw a slight decline. Xin Yao and Xinya in the pharmaceutical industry fell slightly, which was a small correction after a large rise. Zhong Fa had no market. Wuzhou continued to rise. You Yi and Zhongxi were stable. The Wentian Water and Electricity and Bishang Electric in the public utilities industry rose sharply. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Fire saw a slight decrease. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate created new highs again. Standard MSG continued to reach new heights amid buying pressure. Fumin and Jimi Foods were firm. Kangyuan Canning stood firmly at its original price. Da Hua Ranch, Jinfeng Paper, Zhongxing Timber, and Hua Yi Shipbuilding had more demand than supply. The rumor that Bao'an Glass would increase capital and send one share for every two shares held was confirmed, and the price suddenly soared. Jiuan, a long-standing industrial stock, saw high prices again. Da Zhonghua Industry was already approaching the barrier, and the momentum did not stop near noon. China Investment surged. Zhonghua Industry made its debut on the market at a price of 2.6 times the par value, and the demand did not stop.</p>
<p>Xinli Chemical Leaf Factory, specializing in the production of various four-leaf teas, has a thriving business and a capital of 16 million yuan with a par value of 10 yuan. Also, Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, specializing in the production of various colored fabrics, has a capital of 10 million yuan with a par value of 10 yuan. Also, Tianlun Weaving Factory manufactures various silk yarns and wide and narrow elastic bands with a capital of 3 million yuan and a par value of 10 yuan. The above three types of stocks are all scheduled to be listed and circulated today, which is attracting the attention of investors.</p>
<h3>Activities of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Tea Industry: The tea industry trade associations in various regions previously received a letter from the National Commercial Control Association instructing them to prepare for organization and designating initiators and contact persons. It is now learned that the various preparatory matters have been completed, and a founding meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM at No. 7 Tiantang Street. The association has sent special letters to the industry representatives in various regions to attend on time and discuss association affairs together, and it has requested the competent authorities to send personnel to provide supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>Rayon Industry: The Rayon Merchants Association of this city held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon. Yuan Jingbang was elected as chairman of the board, Ding Bingkun and Sha Jingzhi as managing directors, Chen Chongguang and Kuang Hua as general affairs directors, Zhang Xinquan and Gu Xiyun as finance directors, and Xu Boheng and Xie Lanzhou as business directors. The board of directors was announced on the same day to conduct business in its name.</p>
<p>Coal Cinder Industry: The Coal Cinder Industry Association of this city, in accordance with the orders of the authorities, was organized and established yesterday in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. The first directors and supervisors took office under the supervision of the Economic Bureau and the competent authorities. The elected chairman of the board is Mr. Cha Xiangsheng. It is heard that the association will implement a rationing and distribution system to suppress market prices and benefit the people's needs.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Senmao Chemical Industrial Raw Material Manufacturing Factory was established in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China with a capital of 3 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Based on current equipment and raw materials, it is estimated to be more than three times that amount. The chairman of the board is Zhang Yueguo, and the directors are Xue Difu, Tan Xingzhong, Bao Yulin, Rong Qizhao, Dong Xiaopei, etc. The general manager is Xue Difu, and the factory director is Tan Xingzhong. The factory is located at the end of Xuhong Road, Xujiahui, with separate drying and refining departments. Currently, the refining department is increasing the production of wood incense, perfume, and other products to meet the industrial raw material needs of various factories.</p>
<p>The matter of food oil rationing in this city was originally supplied by the military distribution group and then distributed by the food oil industry wholesale office to various retailers in the industry for resale to users. It is now learned that starting this month, the supply of food oil will be taken over by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee. As for the rationing matter, it will still be the responsibility of the food oil industry wholesale office.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Firewood and Charcoal to be Shipped to Shanghai for Market</h3>
<p>According to firewood and charcoal industry news yesterday, due to the recent sluggish transportation in various regions, the source of firewood and charcoal is not smooth, and the arrival of goods is limited, resulting in soaring market prices. The price of second-class goods even exceeded the 2 yuan mark per catty. In view of this, the industry immediately led its members to purchase large quantities from the producing areas. A certain amount has now been collected and will be shipped to Shanghai in succession in the near future. At that time, the supply of goods will definitely increase sharply. However, the industry urgently hopes that the authorities will provide assistance and supply ships to facilitate transportation. As for the current inventory, it is still quite sufficient, and there is no fear of shortage in future supply.</p>

<h3>Scenery of Sicily</h3>
<p>The battle in Sicily continues fiercely. The anti-Axis forces are attempting to expand the bridgeheads formed in Catania, Gela, Syracuse, Pachino, Augusta, and other places. Therefore, the Italian military headquarters announced: The Axis forces are withdrawing from Agira and Caltagirone. The goal of the anti-Axis forces' landing battle in Sicily is probably to link up the American and British forces to establish a large bridgehead north of the Syracuse-Gela line and to suppress the entire island in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Sicily is said to be an island, but it is not an isolated island. It is connected to the Italian mainland across the Strait of Messina by the Strait of Sicily. Today, politically, militarily, and economically, it is completely a part of the Italian mainland. Its area is roughly equal to that of Shikoku in Japan and can be called a country of perpetual spring, a paradise on earth. From December to February, there is a special local custom called "Sicilian Spring." Moreover, located at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea and the center of East-West transportation, it has been subject to the intermingling of labor and influences from the Phoenicians, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, and others since ancient times. Whether from a human or cultural point of view, it gives us an impression completely different from that of northern and central Italy: its sunshine and friendly Oriental flavor naturally evoke a sense of nostalgia in the Japanese.</p>
<h3>World-Famous Marsala Wine</h3>
<p>Today's national literature, when viewed from a historical perspective, is developed from the Latin system and the "Sicilian Bulgare" (a kind of popular literature) that coexisted with it. That "Sicilian troubadour" with an Oriental flavor is the origin of modern Italian literature. It is a product of this kind of landscape and environment.</p>
<p>The terrain in the southeastern part where the British and American forces landed is different from the Apennine range in the northern part and the volcanic range centered on Mount Etna in the northeast. It is a hilly area of the Tertiary period. Between the hills, there are many shallow and barren sandy beaches. Sulphur, rock salt, asbestos, and other mineral products are abundant. In short, blessed by the geographical environment, climate, and wind direction, agricultural and marine products are extremely abundant. Giant asphodels, cacti, palm trees, etc. are everywhere. Olive groves, citrus groves, and vineyards are connected by paths. Therefore, the output of wine is also very large. Italy is the third-largest wine-producing area after America and Tuscany. It is said that Etna Wine, centered on Mount Etna north of Catania, which was immediately repelled after the British landed in the east, and Marsala in the northwest, a strategic location that the enemy forces are trying to seize, are famous for producing wine. Marsala wine, in particular, is a flavoring ingredient for the world-famous Marsala dishes.</p>
<h3>Sincere, Hospitable, and Martial</h3>
<p>Sicilians are generally short in stature, with black eyes. Many resemble Japanese people. Their temperament also has an Oriental flavor. They are both enthusiastic and fierce, imbued with martial spirit. The reports of the people assisting the military in annihilating the enemy's landed troops are a testament to this spirit of the Sicilians.</p>
<p>Palermo has been the capital of Sicily since ancient times. Even today, with a population of 439,000, it is the largest city on the island, along with Catania with a population of 156,000 and Messina with 255,000, representing one of the three major ports. It can be reached by boat from Naples in one night or by plane in three hours. Backed by the hills of Pellegrino, the scenery in the port is picturesque. Mr. Du Yin Ai saw the Orient in a dream (Xiang Jun from Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun).</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Home for the Aged: A Spectacle of Brocade Clothing and Bedding</h3>
<p>Most of the clothing and bedding for the elderly at the Shanghai Home for the the Aged are donated old clothes from various sectors of society. After being acquired by the nuns, they are immediately altered and adapted according to each resident's size and needs. Sometimes, scraps of fabric are solicited from Chinese and Western silk and clothing stores; even a small piece is welcome. After washing and ironing, they are carefully patched together, truly a "gathering of fox furs to make a robe," and sewn into beautiful brocade garments. Artistic embellishments make them appear beautiful yet dignified. Most adorable are the brocade quilts in the residents' bedrooms, patched together using the aforementioned method. Many are even pieced together into various patterns and designs, exceedingly beautiful. In the Lingnan region, these "hundred-flower quilts," with auspicious connotations, are considered the most grand gift for weddings. How could we not be happy for the elderly at the Home for the Aged today? But all of this is the result of the nuns' painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>Sister Tang Zhang led the way to the clothing rooms for both men and women. Each room has a nun in charge of management, just like the dining hall and kitchen. Along the walls of each room are divided wardrobes, each with about twenty compartments, one for each person. All the elderly residents' clothes are stored separately, with names listed. Because the organizers are foreign nuns, the Chinese names have all been transliterated into French. All clothes are sorted by season and regularly cleaned. If anything is torn, the nuns repair it. The elderly change their clothes once or several times a week according to the season. On clothing exchange days, the nuns select the appropriate items and place them at the head of each person's bed. Some elderly residents, whether men or women, require the nuns to help them dress due to mobility issues.</p>
<p>Within the Home for the Aged, there is a specially established laundry area and drying terrace of considerable size. The laundry area has two rooms, a small one dedicated to washing the nuns' clothing, and a larger one divided into a general clothing washing area and a washing area for patients' clothing. Each room has running water, specially made cement washing sinks, and drainage ditches, among other modern facilities. A large, copper disinfecting machine, as immense as an oil depot, has specially designed steps so the laundry workers can place and retrieve clothing. There is also a shaded drying and ironing area, as well as a water-extracting and water-ironing machine. According to the foreign nun who manages the laundry, the clothes of all four hundred and some residents are laundered by the nuns themselves. Elderly residents who are physically able also help out. More laundry is done on Mondays, so more people are mobilized to help. The consumption of soap is quite significant; nearly one hundred and sixty bars are used on this day. At least two cases are used each month, which has become a major issue. Donations from all sectors are hoped for.</p>
<h3>Pictures of Early Rising and Late Sleeping</h3>
<p>It was finally dusk in the summer. After dinner, the elderly residents had gone off to do the "things" they each enjoyed. The "recreation room" is where the elderly relax, furnished with sofas, wicker chairs, tea tables, recliners, and more. Small groups of companions chat carefree, some recounting past experiences, evoking a feeling of renewed vitality; others expressing gratitude for God's love and the nuns' hard work. Some who have recently arrived inquire about stories from the Home. Although the topics are mundane, they happily talk about them. They all lament to reporters about the troubles of the world, the foolishness of people fighting each other, and the joy of seeing the light of heaven after entering the Home.</p>
<p>Besides the recreation room, there is also a smoking room. Some elderly residents, holding long pipes, leisurely relax by the north window, appearing very content. This is a scene rarely seen in Shanghai society these days. It is said that the tobacco was also solicited by the nuns. Little remains now. I wonder if any refined gentlemen will donate more?</p>
<p>There are even more elderly residents enjoying the cool air in the courtyard by the side gate. Several bedridden residents sit in specially made patient carts, pushed by the nuns, enjoying themselves. They almost forget any pain. How would the elderly know that in companies today, these newer and more elaborate patient carts sell for ten to twenty thousand yuan apiece?</p>
<p>Elderly residents with less physical strength have already settled into their bedrooms. From the second to the third floor, there are a total of twenty-five large rooms, each accommodating fourteen people. Each person has a finely made single iron bed. Because they are constantly repaired and repainted, they look as good as new. Each bed has a complete and clean mat, blanket, quilt, pillow, and a small bedside table for placing personal items. At this time, several elderly residents are already reclining, gently fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans. Many elderly residents have not yet entered their bedrooms, and their beds are still covered with beautiful "hundred-flower quilts," making one suspect they are in the inner chambers of wealthy families.</p>
<p>The nuns at the Home personally support and care for the elderly from early morning to late at night, even assisting with matters of urination and defecation, which sometimes requires immediate assistance. Moreover, they diligently wash and change the clothes and bedding in the bedrooms to ensure they are neat and clean. Most surprising is that the floors in the bedrooms and other rooms are as polished as mirrors. Even the dance floor in a grand ballroom would not be more impressive. Does the Home for the Aged have money to wax the floors every day? The nuns said that it is the result of wiping them with coffee grounds. Because of the dedication to cleanliness, the bedrooms of both men and women are as clean and bright as a grand hall.</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Establishes Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>To serve society and culture, assist in school education, and fulfill the Buddhist principle of providing convenience and benefits, Jing'an Temple has specially established a Buddhist scholarship fund. For the time being, it will only assist impoverished students at universities and vocational schools. When the fund expands in the future, it will be extended to primary and secondary schools. It is heard that the temple is currently raising scholarship funds and actively promoting scholarship work. It will begin to be implemented from this semester. Students from all universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools in the city who [1] respect Buddhism, [2] have excellent academic performance, [3] have good moral character, and [4] are truly from impoverished families can apply to the temple for scholarships. The application procedure is to obtain an application form from the temple, attach a transcript and credentials, and have them reviewed and investigated by experts invited by the temple before being approved for payment. The temple has printed a simple brochure on the scholarship facilities, which can be obtained by various sectors.</p>
<h3>Free Clinic and Medication</h3>
<p>National physician Yu Peiyuan, specializing in internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics, has been commissioned by the Li family to provide free consultations and medication from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM every day, starting today. Consultation fees and medication costs will all be waived. There is a limit of ten patients. Registration should be done in advance before noon. The clinic is located at 281 Malan Road, inside Kangdetang National Medicine Store.</p>
<p>Zhirentang National Medicine Store, located at the intersection of Kangti Road and Malan Road, is now offering free consultations and medication by expert physicians every day from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM in order to care for patients during the summer season.</p>
<p>Found Article for Charity Sale: The first team of the Public Concession Epidemic Prevention Group found a hat on the 26th of last month. Because no one claimed it, they entrusted the Haimei Shoes and Hats Store at 6 Kaizi'er Road to sell it for charity, and the proceeds will be used for the scholarship fund of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: A string of keys was found on the North Sichuan Road Bridge one morning. Losers, please specify the accompanying items and number when claiming them at the office (Jiang Jingzhe). A string of ten keys was found on the way in Wanyi Road. The owner should report to 215 Lane 24, A4, Matterhorns Road within ten days to claim it. (Hu Xuehan)</p>
