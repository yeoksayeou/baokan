<h3 id="c1">論中國餐 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>在日本，有以日本人的心理，忖度中國人的性格和習慣為絕對不可理解的奇怪的一羣「支那通」。他們說，中國人是凡在地上生長的和活著的東西，都想要吃的人種。他們所說出來的證據：例如日本人望而生厭的貓肉，狗肉，蛇肉，中國人都當作「家常便飯」，可怕者，如攀着活生生的猴頭，大喝其腦汁，活的小老鼠塗上蜜，然後就毫不介意地從頭吃到尾。我來上海以前，多少也相信過這樣「支那通」的話。然而實際來到上海一看，却不是這一會事。大多數中國民眾所吃的食物，和日本人並沒有什麼特別不同。在馬路上看到活迸亂跳的貓和狗，顯然並未吃光，於是心內稍微感覺到與已往聽到的不符合。</p>
<p>然而，令人仍然吃驚的，是宴會上擺出來的大菜分量及共花樣繁多。「人類是無所不吃的動物」，這句話在中國人的中國餐中，才能毫無過憾地充分表現出它的三昧境來。當然，無所不吃的性質，並非單純人類有，而猪，熊，鴨等也都有，但牠們在食物的花樣上說，總還遠不及人類。即在人類中間，其中　達到中國人程度的一牛者，也還非常的少。因此，中國人誇稱中國餐的花樣繁多和好吃程度為世界第一。然而中國人中，在好多人注意到中國餐的花樣繫多中，交織着中國五千年的饑餓史。林語堂也會說過：「中國人口過剩，饑饉極為普遍，所以靠近我們的，當然什麼都要吃囉！因此籍關於這種食物的全部經騐，我們偶而有種種的重要發見，這也是當然的結果」。中國人賞在是由於饑饉的壓迫，從柱昔就試嚐堆球上的一切，會發見其中有的適合於人的食物，在某種情形上，食而中毒，叉曾發見此種解毒藥。結果　在西曆五年，已經有了關於「本草」食物和食療法的特殊博物學的書籍。</p>
<p>在其他國家裏，民衆在荒年發見的食糧，而豐收時就輕輕亡輕亡心掉了。然而其在中國，形成中國餐的繁多花樣而保存起來的理由，也許在於中國會有畏期綿延不斷的封建君主制度。像畢斯麥每天早餐要吃七十個雞蛋那樣的胃囊，在中國的封建君主當中還很少，他們的胃喪，無論怎樣大，但實際上「酒池肉林」總也用不盡。然而在量上經常得到滿足的他們，於是，便不得不在質上求滿足。因而封建君主的廚役，必須滿足他們的厭膩味覺，而經常發見新的美味食物。民衆在饑體時發見的食物，立刻加以研究泡製，供獻給君主作食物。對於厭倦的胃口，一定歡喜味道奇異的食物吧！假設味道不好，廚役就作些君主最喜歡聽的辯解。例如說，這種食物雖然味道不大好，但是壯陽袖腎的。於是，木來向以採花獵色為日常主要項目的對建君主：就歡天喜地把這個不好吃的食物吃下去。於是，鹿角，雄蠶，雀卵等，也就作為大吃大嚼的食物了。尤共是性懲上的目的和味覺上的目的共同一致之食物，例如魚翅燕窩等物，已經成為中國餐中不可或缺的東西。中華民國的自由民，一直到現在，為表示對對建制度的忠實，發見燕窩並非在海岸的岩壁上，而是在海水裹（冷天），仍然把牠當作一樣不可或缺的菜。</p>
<p>封建君主的食物，不僅需要滿足味覺，而且還要壯陽補腎，更進而要求延年益壽，所以不斷試嘗新的食物。這種現象，未必專限於中國。據說蘇羅門王僱用着十二個廚長。其中十一個人，為了尋找世界各處的未知名的葡萄酒，以及改革了的食物，經常在旅途上。我認為秦始皇命齊人徐市赴蓬萊求長生不老藥和蘇羅門王追求有營養的珍奇食物，是同出一轍。封建君主總是想比對方封建諸侯，更延長壽命，想取得人生的更大快樂，所以優待他的廚役，使不斷研究珍奇泡製法。由於跟他人相互競爭的意識，而在封建貴族間，盛行的討論着，與其吃熊掌，莫如吃活猴腦更有效，與其吃象鼻，莫如吃鳳肝更滋義等等。這正如以前在羅馬有用紅鶴腦作成餅膾而獻給皇帝馬克·安多尼吃的一個人，因此而獲到三萬五千人口的大城市；有用奴隸生肉喂養海續魚，取其肝而作成菜，獻給赫里歐加巴拉斯（Heliogabalus　218-222）皇帝吃的一個人，希望得到一個城市等的時代，完全相同，是一種食慾　態時代。因而中國餐的花樣繁多，是由於封建貴族的擁護，而才研究和發達的，後來不久便變為成規，以至產生像今大那樣四冷，四熱，十大菜，點心，一湯，而不管胃褒容積如何的菜單。</p>
<p>然而，即使在那一個時代，像這樣競奇賽珍的烹炒，對於有良心的人，也會瞠目昨舌的。孔子說過：「食不厭精，膾不厭細」，又說過：「沽酒，市脯不食」，意思就是說，與其吃滿目豐盛的大菜，莫如吃簡素的「家常便飯」。且當時民衆的大多數，對於珍貴的中國餐是無緣的，每天只是吃些油炒的靑菜和米飯，如果十天吃到一片猪肉，那已經口福不淺了，這一點和目前並沒有什麼大的不同。以前日本的「支那通」所看到的，只是中國的上層，於是而斷定這是中國上下普遍的現象，那就錯了。</p>
<p>中國餐的菜單，無論怎樣不管人類的胃囊大小，這究竟是根據中國社會機構的必要而產生的。在中產階級很少的這個國家裹有專門吃中國餐的階級，同時，還有食其唾餘而生有的乞食階級，這種人比其他任何國家都特別多。與中國人誇稱中國餐在分量上和在花樣上為世界第一，同時，食唾餘而生存的乞食階級的數目，也不能不算世界第一。專門吃中國餐的階級，和食其殘餘而生存的階級間，在地位上說，有天壤之別，但在政治上却有相亙依賴的關係。前者假借增加唾餘量來收買乞食階級，利用作反對中產階級（也許稱作生產階級更校洽當）民主主義運動的反動制動機。降落為乞食階級的老舍所寫的「駱駝祥子」曾說：「什麼運動，什麼請願團……什麼都好，只要拿兩毛錢或三毛錢來，什麼都幹」。軍閥及其支持的高利貸資本家，以只要這如許錢而就無所不為的反動乞食階級，為其利益的支持者。民族革命目的之一，首先應當是把這一反動乞食階級轉變為生產階級，敎他們擺脫啜食中國餐的殘餘，而用自已的血汗賃取燒餅和油條，這樣我認為更好些。一面把中國餐的分量和花樣，改為更現實些，同時使一般民衆的食物也在另一意義上改為史現實些，這一點必須當作革命目標之一。</p>
<p>唯在「飢不擇食」這個意義上，像中國民衆那樣什麼都可吃的民衆，在世界上眞是絕無僅有，所以今後　稱中國餐為世界最好吃且花樣最多，倒沒有必要了。今後的間題，是應當注意怎樣把現實的飯，充分給與民衆的胃囊。在這一點上，究竟怎樣應當處理政治，這就是問題巾心所在。（漢譯）</p>

<p>綠色的二十六路公共汽車沿着歐化的大西路行駛。如果未到憶定盤路，就在汪家弄下車，那麼在右前方，你就可以看到一所三層的花園洋房、鐵門旁邊除了標明「六六」的門牌之外，還有一塊輝煌的牌子寫明「女靑年會主辦上海托兒所」別輕視這小小的集團，却在試辦着解放婦女培養英才的新時代的大事業咧！</p>
<p>時代的事業</p>
<p>「托兒所」這三個字被人注意，還是不久以前的事，在上海、還算是嶄新的事業、可是、它對社會和國家，却具有極戰大的意義。</p>
<p>世界文明進化的重要因素，第一是要使兒童受到斜學的教養，自幼就在德，智，體，羣方面有健全的發育、為未來對社會國家事業奠立基礎；第二是要使婦女與男子們從深閉與舊制度的桎桔中解放出來，與男子們同樣地担負起對社會國家的查任。</p>
<p>然而，我國絕對多數的兒童，自幼生長詫陳應，黑暗·迷借和缺乏新時代教養的家庭裏，心量上和身理上自幼便不健全•同時，我國絕對多數的婦女，被壓抑在封建制與宗法觀念的　桎梏下，甚至許多曾受新教育的、也仍未能克全擺脫。特別是在給婚生育子女以後，她們雖然已取得與男子相同的公民權，雖有為社會國家服務的雄心，也因家　及子女的拖累而徒呼負負。這兩種現象、是社會不進化的重要因素。</p>
<p>托兒所便是消除這種阻碍文明進化因素的新事業。有了托兒所的組織·就可使詐多　才和有志的女子，因子女有托而放心去為社會國家服務：同時，嬰孩或幼兒在托兒所內，受到科化的撫育，身學心兩方，都有優良言理的陶治，為國民教育預奠基礎。</p>
<p>產業革命使人類文化向上發展一層，也開始誕生了這師托兒所的制度，近來文明強國·托兒所運動都很發達、其中尤以蘇聯和德國為最著名。在我國·得時代風氣之先的茶干地方，已在積極試辦，敢穫到相當威續。這幾年來，凡有思想有志氣的人士、莫不對托兒所事業感到興趣和希望，上海女靑年會的托兒所、就是在這新時代的需要下誕生的。</p>
<p>誕生與發展</p>
<p>是民國二十九年、戰爭開始了三年以後的上海，一般人民的生活一天比一天艱苦·沿馬路的棄兒，一天比一天增多，「誰無子女、忍其天設道左」？何况、介日幻兒的劫難·正是未來社會的捐失　！那時對於棄現的救濟。雖有聖母院靑嬰堂，仁濟育嬰堂，新普育黨等慈善團體努力，但是，實際上還有許多父母。無力養育但又不忍拋棄其子女，因此影響了他們的事深與前逐，悲劇在每一條街道和里弄巾表演若。上海某督敷女靑年會的幹事如卞煦孫女士等幾位，深覺這些悲劇必須停止、因此，研究創辦托兒所，使這些父母解除了子女的率累、放心大膽去做有益於社會國衆的事業，不用為拋棄子女而受良心貴　、也不必　憂子女無人教養。無且將來又仍舊可以領回，一家團圓！這是何等理想的事！</p>
<p>上海托兒所籌備委員會在這高尚的理想下成立了，經過討論，計劉和　款，奔走忙碌了四個月之後，居然大功初步告成，到了三十年三月一日，上海第一個托兒所—「女靑年會主辦上海托兒所」。就在白利南路的同仁醫院內誕生了。</p>
<p>在苦難的時代巾誕生的上海托兒所，經費和人材都不充足，更加因為房屋狹小，事業的範圍不能太大。托兒所是上海首創的產業，為了引起各界的了解和信任，她們必須辦得特別好，使托兒所運動普遍開展。第一要緊的是保持幼兒的健康，避免有死亡等事。因此，入所時的體格檢騐不能不特別嚴格。服務的對象，也限於最貧困的工人的子女。據卞女士說，當時她去調查登記請求入所的孩子的家庭時·看到過不少慘劇·有些父母、在上工以前、就把孩子反　在污穢　矣如　　一般的　裏、她親眼看到因受過飢餓與室息的孫子！在　　檢查時、除了皮膚病為最普遍之外，一百人中寬有三•四十人患有肺病、這　憐事，更加堅定了她們努力於托兒所事業的決心。</p>
<p>由於她們的努力，「上海托兒所」的事業，漸漸引起各界的注意，一方面是同情和援助的人士也日有增加，另一方面，各界對於托兒所之需要也日益增加，許多巾等家庭家長，以及預備遠行謀生的骨年父母們，開始用種種方法企圖把子女送進托兒所去，雖然經過嚴絡的證查之後，不今被拒絕了，但是社會的實際需要也調明托兒所急須擴充。但三十年十二月、同仁醫院院址為當局所徵用、於是忽忽遷移，暫住戈登路女靑年會會所．至去年三月，才覓定大西路六十六號通所較合理想的所地，有極講究的建藥物，有花間、有草場，空氣、光綫和四還的環境，都不失為有益於幼稚兒意心身發育的樂圈。</p>
<p>手續和規則</p>
<p>上海托兒所開始時畢試鄉性質，特別適應近來上海的特殊條件，她們規定服務目標是：保育兒童，使從幼年起，在身體方而，態廣方面，養成健全的某礎，使長大成人之後，可以成為社會國家有用的人材，同時，她們的　接目標是幫助經濟困難的父母，减輕她們的負擔，幫助他們獲得充分時問與精力去發展其事業。</p>
<p>為了創辦時期人力物力及所地等限制，對於接受的兒童，規定下列五個條件：一，須為勞工的子女，其父母收入不能負擔兒童敵當致養者；二，經醫生檢查騐確無結核。花柳及嚴重的皮膚病者；三，　騐智力及格者；四，經由正當　體或公正市民介紹及保證、並經調委及格者；五啊因有特殊情形必須寄托而調查屬實應予援助者。這是幾個基本條件。在所年限以一年為限，要繼續須電辦手續．孩子的親屬，可於每月一日及十六日依照該所規則夫探望。</p>
<p>收竄兒意的名額，初辦時只限於三十名，自初生嬰兒至三足歲為止，男女兼收。當時聞辦費只用一萬元·每月開支亦以一千元為限。一切都以小心　愼為主、企圖辦出些成續來，不求其規　太大，　來知道的人一多，同情贊助的有心人，相踵而來，而社會上的　要也日益增加、於是在三十年六月擴充名額至五十名。遷入大西路新所址以後，地方較大，有了擴充的可能，又得熱心人士之援助，就於三十一年七月　登記者的要求，擴充名額至一百名。以後雖有若干流動，大致都保持這一定額，現在計有男孩六十八名，女孩三十八名，其中價分之八十是半孤兒，其餘百分之二十雖有父母，但無力撫育，即其兄姊亦都在別的兒童教養所裏呢1這些小孩，大部分為經人介紹直接請求寄托的，其中也有由前H都觸兒童保障科送義的、有些孩子，在入所前雖經調查，但事　仍曾發現有欺詐之事，會覺其粗長尙有撫育能力的，只有立即遇囘．當然在遭　也又可以看出社會上對於托見所之需要是如何迫切　！（未完）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c45">保留紗布平均數 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>收買出紗棉布，收買米糧、以及修正戰時刑事特別法，都是解決戰時經濟問　應走的道路、自勝毫無疑義；所紙的路綫中，即使發生波盪不平的狀態，亦祇得認為復興經濟的征程中所不可避免的‘儘可從側面作適當的補教，以期逮到國民經濟復興的目標。</p>
<p>政府收買棉紗布，應為把握民衆的經濟施策，不是打擊民衆的，所以，我們預料政府對於紗為的實行配給辦法以及開始配給日期的公布，當為指顧問事。可是放大眼光來說，我們的期待，恐怕還不止此，因為，收買下來的大量存紗存布，舉竟不能「用之不盡。取之不竭」。紗布收買後。從速配給以外，還須從積極方面推進增產計劃，使物資之供給，長此無虞匱乏，於是一切生產要實中的原料問題、乃成為增產問題的核心。</p>
<p>以棉紡織一類的生產而論，按照收買棉紗棉布暫行條例戰三條，各工廠及零售商應照本年上半年售出或消費總數之一個月平均敷量，准子保留。確切的為紗布廠商保留紗布平均數量，自不失為適當的補救辦法。須知原料過足、固使生產無從通行，因為原料貴於製品，廠商遂乃同持原料，生產於是益减。可是，原料不足，也使生產無從進行，因為廠商雖不能從事於大量的囤持，却能夠推諉於原料的缺乏、而不事生產。所以，保留紗布平均數量，實為最合理的辦法，問題祇在於辦法之如何澈底支持</p>
<h3 id="c46">收買棉紗布後　上海市塲概况　大都將貨物貶價售現投機商人已陷於絕境 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>自政府當局以嚴厲措置，實行敢買棉紗棉布後，本埠市塲之狀况，即為之大變，過去因投機囤積而造成之畸形繁榮，已被掃除殆盡。茲據記者調查所得，分誌如下：</p>
<p>銀錢業　因紗布之收買、表面上雖未受若何之打擊，然實際所受之影響，有非業外人所得知者。良以本埠金融事業、過去一部份建立於商人抽機囤積之上、毋庸　言。各銀行之能以資金運用於正當生產之投資者，幾如鳳毛麟角，在紗有未收置前，一部份銀行接受投機商人之紗布押欽，為數相當可觀，紗布一旦為政府收買，囤積商人經濟破產，共所押之借款，即無力價還，因此銀行遂蒙受損失，迄於近日，金融界方面雖然近在多方設法，以謀補教，但究能捕救至何種程度，尚難進料。加以因當局之嚴抑物價，囤積商人虧拆頗巨、市面銀根奇緊，買　停滯，各銀錢行莊之業務，即隨之淸淡，因之有不少小銀行，已呈外強中乾之局面。過去本埠小銀行之產生，有如雨後春筍者，今則日無人再願新設銀行矣。</p>
<p>販賣商</p>
<p>各業之扳賣者，無論為一百貨公司，或一烟紙店，在過去物價暴漲時代，每一店舖，都將物資囤積，願客上門購物，多遭店員之白眼，蓋在物價日夜飛濃之渦程巾，顧客前往購買一物，等於剝奪一物之暴漲利澗，故各店舖老闆。甯願將貨擱存、而不願售予顧客，亦不通融絲亳之方便，比至紗布收買之後，各進商店或受銀根奇緊之影饗，或恐亦蹈紗布之覆織、運均改變作風，開始貶價出售，甚至以大减價，大贈品相號召。而貨價之削低，往往低於當局限價、　各呢　及其他各種洋雜貨、即　此種現象，故其景况之　慘、亦不足為　外入道。</p>
<p>投機商</p>
<p>上海之投機商、數量　多，我國產業落後、總漲不上　道、商人營利，以投機為唯一之捷徑，無人願以其資水投資於生產事業、戰爭以還、此風更甚、故市塲上之資金，實際均已成為投機市場之生力軍，大都不願參加生產之事業。至其投機方式、約可分為兩大種，一種為個人以其資金，從事於踢皮球父易一種為設一窩字問、進行投機之買賣，規模大小不一，而其方式，則固無分　輕、中秋節前，個人之踢皮球交易，十九已告停頓、節後專為投機買實之寫字問，亦際於無機可投之絕境，因此今日上海之市場，已不若過去之活潑矣。</p>
<h3 id="c47">第一區公署考慮　日用品配給辦法　先從食肥皂火柴着手 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>本市市政的第一區公署當局，鑒於近來本市各項日用物品之價格，並朱因政府當觸之厲行取締囤積壓平物價而降低，茲為安定民生計，決於短期間內實施日用品之按戶配給，且體之配給計劉、正在縝密老黨着手，擬訂中大約在本月底以前可以擬就發表，而自十月份起開始實行，聞第一批實行配給之日用物品、暫定為「食鹽。肥皂。火柴」三種，其配給方法，將按照保甲戶口發購實卷，俾市民在一定時期內持卷向指定商店講買一定數量之物品，俟些二種日用品之配給制度確立施行後，有關當局將逐步擴大配給範圍。蓋目前物資調查委員會，正在加緊調查全上海各公私倉庫內之囤積物資，至全部調查完竣後、政府當局即可擴大收買物資之師圍，而將收買所得之物資作為配給之用云。</p>

<h3 id="c49">德國戰力的分析 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 池崎忠孝</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>對最近的歐洲戰局及其前途，抱着危　而感到不安的人，決不能說絕對沒有，尤以日本的智　階級，關於軍事及戰爭的智　，未必豐富，但從智識階級所特有的神經過敏出發，在把　戰局的大勢上，不硏究其最後的推移，而重視局部戰鬥的結果，因此而輕率地形成一　戰爭的全　觀。因有這傾向，乃對歐洲戰局及其前途。更致懷疑，</p>
<p>歐洲戰局未可樂觀率直地說來，自德軍在東部戰綫大撤退以後，歐洲的軸心陣綫旗幟，決不能使我們喝采。尤以繼軸心軍撤退北非以後的地中海戰綫之局面，自英美軍占領班泰雷利亞，利　　，　倍吐　三島以來，更占領西西里島，不久並發展爲最近的義國本土登陸戰，這局面在軸心方面說自然是日趨險惡。</p>
<p>加以在東部戰綫，收復奧萊爾，　斯克，貝爾格洛特的蘇聯軍嘎季攻勞·今尙在活潑地繼續中，此後的情勢，亦決不能斷然說不利於蘇聯軍。所以如其重視每天的局部戰鬥之結果，並想因此而形成戰局的全體觀，那麽對最近的歐洲，戰局及其前途，抱着危懼而感不安的人，亦不能一定說他們是神經過敏所致。</p>
<p>勝負非由局部決定但近代戰的勝負，斷非由局部戰鬥的結果所決定。歷時四年的歐洲戰局，其性質日趨複雜，戰局的歸趨，早已脫離了被一城一池的爭奪，零星戰鬥的勝敗所決定境界。所以當觀察時，不能不擴大視野，深入洞察戰局的眞相。</p>
<p>現在的歐洲戰局，大體上可分爲二種局面。一是長逮二千嘎的東部戰綫，一是最近在義大利半島南端所展開的地中海戰綫。這二條戰綫，在其本身上沒有直接的聯絡，在其戰綫上相對時的主要勢力，一方面是德軍對蘇軍，他方面是德軍對英美軍，所以在形成所謂對歐洲戰局的全體觀時，便宜上有區分爲二而加以觀察的必要。</p>
<p>這　我想先來考察束部德蘇戰綫的　　。當考察其歸趨時，英美的存在暫置不論，單把這當作德國與蘇聯的戰爭，不有於構成目前戰局的種種細事，從較爲根本的，且本質的視錢，避免一切主觀，冷靜地考察二者的立塲，來檢討德蘇二國之中，究竟那方面保持着比較有利的地位。</p>
<p>綜合戰力可以致勝我所見的現階段德蘇戰爭，喪失了戰爭的第一期以至第二期的性格，到達了僅由其綜合戰力的優劣，決定最後勝負的時期。而可視爲其綜合戰力者，第一是軍力，第二是軍需品生產力，倫三是食糧自給力，第四是能夠耐受戰爭的　　和　怖的國民精神力。</p>
<p>就現在德軍的兵力而　，恐怕沒有人知道其正確的數字。漢遜鮑　　　算爲三百五十至三百六十個師團，蘇聯的情報稱有三百另二個師團。但無論其實數如何，德軍的兵力，遺駕蘇聯之上，這是毫無疑惑的餘地。</p>
<p>蘇聯的人口，約當德國的二倍。開戰以來的消耗，非常浩大，僅蘇聯本身爲唯一的兵力資源，反之，德國則開戰以來的消耗極少，在其周國有許多衛舉國家，這些國家所供給的兵力，有理由可推測其爲額頗鉅，與蘇聯的比較起來，佔很有利的立塲。</p>
<p>現在的軸心軍，除主要的德義二軍外，並有保加利亞·羅馬尼亞，克羅地亞，匈牙利，及斯洛伐克等國的軍隊。漢遜鮑爾溫估計這些國家的總兵力約三十個師團，徵之前次大戰的實際，殊覺佔計太少。我以爲現在歐洲的軸心軍，其總兵力約近〇〇萬，與之對抗的蘇聯軍，大約爲九百萬左右。</p>
<p>軍需生產德佔優勢至於軍需口生產力，當然德國占優勢地位。德國本身有龐大的生產組織，加上了虞森堡的鋼鐵業，比利時的情密工業，捷克的軍需工業，而且可以動員法國的工業力。英美對　爾區及漢堡的轟炸，其主要目的在削减其生產力。這對德國尙朱給與致命的效果。</p>
<p>蘇聯由於工　的遷轉內地，動員老幼，及史大哈諾夫方式的非常生產手段，似得雜持想像以上的生產力。但無論怎樣說，不僅　戰後不久即行喪尖了頓巴斯以四的大工業地　，而且和擁有七百外人勞動者的德國比較時，其勞動力的來源亦極稀薄，終非德國之敵，當然經由伊期路綫，北洋航路，和西伯利亞鐵這等可獲得若干　　物資，然而以此而說可以補充蘇聯生產力的劣勢，恐怕任何人不作此想。</p>
<p>要之，蘇聯的兵力資源，如哈定博士所說，　竭至不能不徵發邊　的外蒙古人的程度。蘇聯的軍需品生產力，如威爾基所指出，斯科達，新希奈基，肯尼茲，士威爾特爾夫司克等各種式樣，　然並陳。所以從這幾　看來，德蘇的優劣，一見即知。（翔：驟自九月八日東京讀賣報如）</p>

<h3 id="c50">從小學敎師的待遇說起 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 楊錦兆</p>
<p>社會上最淸高神聖的職業是什麽？是教師。社會上待遇最微薄的職業是什麼？是敎師。這兩種矛盾的現象，在全國各地普遍地存在。　着矛盾的深刻，中國的敎育，早已臨到嚴重的危機。我們時常聽到多少家長抱怨道：「孩子的程度差啦！」「老師常常缺席」！……我們敎育的從業員也承認，小朋友的程度，一年不如一年，一小半是由於敎師「心有二用」，不能完全負起責任來：大半的原因，實在是師資的濫芋充數。我敢斗胆地說，上海許多的低級級任老帥，在學歷上只是初中生而已。俗語「明師出高徒」，師既不明，徒何能高。歸根結底，完全因爲待遇太薄，連個人生活不足維持，這論其他。</p>
<p>戰則上海市立小學敎帥待遇較優，以一高中師範科畢業生，月得敎薪五十元。每在原校服務三年，晋級一次，加薪五元，其法至善。此次事愛後，其初教員月薪三十元，主任四卞元，校長五十元，已爲微薄。當時每月膳食，六元已足。三十元的待遇，勉强可以維持小家庭生活。隨着生活程度的高漲，敎薪雖逐有增加，但戴至本年度七月份止，市立小學敎師待遇，僅二百二十元。八月份有加薪的消息，至今尙未實現。拿這幾個錢來看，每月三十日計之，每日辛勞所得，還不到七元四角錢，祗能夠買到七隻大餅，不足　兩碗陽春麵。當然，有許多敎育界全仁，可以向家庭取得生活的保障，但有更多的小敎同志，一直在生活的旋渦裏掙扎，沒有透一口的機會。所得不足溫飽，那麽怎能專心一志的培養國家未來的主人翁呢？數年以來，眼見着受過師範訓練的敎師紛紛他去，或學費，或入政，或掛搭角皮帶，或爲　挑小販，眞有「百感交集，啼笑皆非」之感。現據我知道，上海私立小學待遇平均較布立爲優，普通在五白元左右，不過要想維持家庭生活，還不知要相差千萬里呢？於是全市公私立小學敎師，都感到有迫切增加待遇的必要：</p>
<p>敎師待遇的　準，曾經記得敎育概論上說：「小學敎師之待遇，以當地衣食住行二倍之生活費用爲標準」！若本市個人生活費用為五百元，則小學敎師月薪，至少　有一千元·以千元維持小家庭，已屬生活　虞了。</p>
<p>全市私立小學，戰立小學校，根據上年度統計，市校共計一百十三校，敎職員數爲一千一百四十四名。此一千餘名小學敎師分佈佈市每一個角落，所負文化的使命很是專人，每月收入，不　溫飽，社會之待遇小學敎師，堪日可　。今以一千元爲準，每人增加約七百七十元，市敎育局初等敎育經費支出，須月增八十八萬元。關於經費的開源，是値得研究的問題。</p>
<p>普通一般人，有一錯誤見解，即以爲財政局是生產機關，敎育局爲消耗機關。其寶富國强兵。國民須具有豐富的學認，否則處處落後，何能在現代的邊界角逐，而得到優勝。過去政治的不上軌道、敎育經費獨立的呼聲，甚囂　上·但「教育」「財政」，界限劃分甚淸，我們不容紊亂，戰後敎育經費不足，曾於　市畏　助之下，辦理　席捐，抽百分之十·初招商承包，月計三萬元·復　同自辦，收入約二十萬左右，全部均經補助教育費用。現在租借接收，地方行政一元化，筵席捐能推及一·八兩區，若全市一日營業總數爲百萬元（當不止此數）得抽捐十萬元，月計三百萬元。除一部分增加市立小學敎員待遇外，對於全市敎育，定當推進不少。我們可以看到上海敎育界一新耳目。</p>
<p>除了增加待遇外，我們更希望市敎育局方面，關懷敎育界同仁的淸寒，體念苦衷，與有關當局商洽，全面　給日用必需品，如米，煤，布，糖，鹽，等，使每一個服務敎育界的人，認定敎育事業為終身職業，健全師資不他走，間接的一國文化程度，也漸漸提高起來。聞此次全市名區敎育會成立，競爭頗烈，我希望當選的幹事，要名符其實的幹一下事，爲敎育界同仁謀福利，更爲小敎的待遇，作一次合理的鬥爭！</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Chinese Cuisine <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>In Japan, there is a strange group of "China experts" who believe, with the absolute certainty of Japanese psychology, that the character and habits of the Chinese are incomprehensible. They say that Chinese people are the kind of people who want to eat anything that grows or lives on the ground. The evidence they cite: for example, cat meat and dog meat, which Japanese people find repulsive, are considered "home-cooked meals" by Chinese people. Even more terrifying, they say, is the practice of holding a live monkey and drinking its brains, or coating live baby mice with honey and eating them whole, head to tail, without hesitation. Before I came to Shanghai, I somewhat believed what these "China experts" said. However, after actually coming to Shanghai, I found that this was not the case. The food eaten by most Chinese people is not particularly different from that of the Japanese. Seeing cats and dogs jumping around on the streets, it was clear that they had not been eaten up, so I felt a slight discrepancy with what I had heard in the past.</p>
<p>However, what is still surprising is the large quantity and variety of dishes served at banquets. The saying "Humans are omnivorous animals" can only be fully expressed without regret in Chinese cuisine. Of course, the characteristic of being omnivorous is not unique to humans, but also to pigs, bears, ducks, etc., but they are far behind humans in terms of the variety of foods they consume. Even among humans, those who reach the level of the Chinese are still very few. Therefore, the Chinese boast that the variety and deliciousness of Chinese cuisine is the best in the world. However, among the Chinese, many people have noticed that intertwined with the great variety of Chinese cuisine is China's five thousand-year history of famine. Lin Yutang once said: "China is overpopulated, and famine is extremely common, so of course we eat anything that is close to us! Therefore, through all our experience with this kind of food, we occasionally make all kinds of important discoveries, and this is a natural result." The Chinese have long been forced by famine to try everything on the planet, and have discovered that some of it is suitable for human food. In certain situations, they have even discovered antidotes for food poisoning. As a result, as early as 5 AD, there were already special natural history books about "materia medica" foods and dietary therapy.</p>
<p>In other countries, the food that the people discover in famine years is easily forgotten in times of plenty. However, the reason why the variety of Chinese cuisine has been formed and preserved in China may lie in the long-lasting feudal monarchical system. There are very few feudal monarchs in China with stomachs like Bismarck, who ate seventy eggs for breakfast every day. No matter how big their stomachs were, they could never actually exhaust the "ponds of wine and forests of meat." However, those who were constantly satisfied in quantity had to seek satisfaction in quality. Therefore, the chefs of the feudal monarchs had to satisfy their jaded tastes and constantly discover new and delicious foods. The food discovered by the people in times of famine was immediately studied and prepared, and offered to the monarch as food. For a tired appetite, they must have liked foods with strange flavors! If the taste was not good, the chefs would make excuses that the monarch liked to hear. For example, they would say that although this food does not taste very good, it strengthens the yang and nourishes the kidneys. Therefore, the feudal monarch, whose daily main projects were picking flowers and hunting for beauty, would happily eat this unpalatable food. Thus, deer antlers, male silkworms, and sparrow eggs became foods to be eaten heartily. In particular, foods that serve both sexual and gustatory purposes, such as shark fin and bird's nest, have become indispensable in Chinese cuisine. Even now, the free people of the Republic of China, in order to show their loyalty to the feudal system, continue to regard bird's nest as an indispensable dish, even though they discover that it is not found on coastal cliffs, but in the sea (in cold weather).</p>
<p>The food of the feudal monarch not only needed to satisfy the taste buds, but also to strengthen the yang and nourish the kidneys, and even more so to prolong life, so they constantly tried new foods. This phenomenon is not necessarily limited to China. It is said that King Solomon employed twelve head chefs. Eleven of them were constantly on the road, searching for unknown wines from all over the world, as well as reformed foods. I believe that Qin Shi Huang's order to the Qi people Xu Shi to go to Penglai to seek the elixir of immortality and King Solomon's pursuit of nutritious and exotic foods are one and the same. Feudal monarchs always wanted to live longer and enjoy life more than their fellow feudal lords, so they treated their chefs well, enabling them to constantly study rare preparation methods. Due to the consciousness of competing with others, it was prevalent among the feudal aristocracy to discuss that it was more effective to eat live monkey brains than bear paws, and that it was more nourishing to eat phoenix liver than elephant trunks. This is just like the era when someone in Rome made a cake with flamingo brains and offered it to Emperor Marcus Antonius, and as a result, he obtained a large city with a population of 35,000; and someone fed sea eels with the raw flesh of slaves, took their livers, and made a dish to offer to Emperor Heliogabalus (218-222), hoping to get a city. It was a complete era of dietary abnormality. Therefore, the variety of Chinese cuisine was researched and developed due to the support of the feudal aristocracy, and soon became a convention, to the extent that it produced a menu like the one we have today, with four cold dishes, four hot dishes, ten main dishes, dim sum, and a soup, regardless of the capacity of the stomach.</p>
<p>However, even in that era, such extravagant cooking would have made people of conscience speechless. Confucius said: "Food should be finely milled, and meat should be finely chopped," and also said: "I do not eat wine bought from the market, or dried meat," meaning that it is better to eat simple "home-cooked meals" than to eat abundant and sumptuous dishes. Moreover, the majority of the people at that time had no access to precious Chinese cuisine, and only ate stir-fried green vegetables and rice every day. If they ate a piece of pork once every ten days, they were already very fortunate. This is not much different from the present. In the past, the Japanese "China experts" only saw the upper class of China, and then concluded that this was a universal phenomenon throughout China, which was wrong.</p>
<p>The Chinese cuisine menu, no matter how much it disregards the size of the human stomach, is ultimately produced according to the needs of the Chinese social structure. In this country where there are few middle-class people, there is a class that specializes in eating Chinese cuisine, and at the same time, there is a beggar class that lives on their leftovers. There are more of these people than in any other country. While the Chinese boast that Chinese cuisine is the best in the world in terms of quantity and variety, the number of beggars who survive on leftovers cannot be ignored as the best in the world either. The class that specializes in eating Chinese cuisine and the class that survives on its leftovers are worlds apart in terms of status, but they have a mutually dependent relationship in politics. The former uses increased amounts of leftovers to buy off the beggar class, using them as a reactionary brake against the democratic movement of the middle class (perhaps it would be more appropriate to call them the productive class). Lao She, who fell into the beggar class, wrote in "Rickshaw Boy": "What movement, what petition... anything is fine, as long as you give me two or three mao." The warlords and the usurious capitalists who support them take the reactionary beggar class, who will do anything for such a small amount of money, as supporters of their interests. One of the goals of the national revolution should be to transform this reactionary beggar class into a productive class, teaching them to get rid of eating the leftovers of Chinese cuisine, and to earn pancakes and fried dough sticks with their own blood and sweat. I think this would be better. On the one hand, the quantity and variety of Chinese cuisine should be changed to be more realistic, and at the same time, the food of the general public should also be changed to be more realistic in another sense. This must be regarded as one of the goals of the revolution.</p>
<p>Only in the sense of "hunger makes no choice," the Chinese people, who can eat anything, are truly unique in the world. Therefore, there is no need to continue to claim that Chinese cuisine is the most delicious and varied in the world. The question for the future is how to fully give the people's stomachs realistic food. In this regard, how should politics be handled? This is the core of the problem.

<p>South Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese naval seaplane squadron, while patrolling in the Solomon Islands area late on the 16th, discovered enemy transport ships and torpedo boats in the following locations. They immediately bombed them, achieving great results:</p>
<p>*   Two enemy torpedo boats were discovered east of Kieta Island and were immediately repelled.</p>
<p>*   Two enemy medium and small transport ships were discovered in the waters off Munda (New Georgia Island). They were immediately attacked and forced to flee.</p>
<p>*   A concentrated bombing raid was carried out on enemy positions near Munda, with heavy bombs dropped. However, due to the darkness of the night, the results are not yet clear.</p>
<p>*   Two enemy torpedo boats were discovered north of Vella Lavella Island and were immediately attacked, forcing them to flee.</p>
<p>*   Three enemy torpedo boats were also discovered in the waters off Visuvisu on the northern tip of New Georgia Island. One was immediately sunk, and the others were repelled.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Military Authorities Announce New Aircraft Names and Announce Features of Three Aircraft Types <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The 20th of this month is Japan's Fourth Aviation Day. The Japanese Army authorities specifically announced the names of three new Japanese Air Force aircraft on the 18th, in order to announce them to the air forces of the great powers. The three new aircraft are the "Shoki" fighter, the "Ryusei" bomber, and the "Si Tei" reconnaissance aircraft. These are all worthy of boasting to the world. The main features are as follows:</p>
<p>*   The "Shoki" has been responsible for annihilation missions since the Greater East Asia War, and has established a glorious posture following the "Hayabusa" fighter. It is the newest fighter in the aerial battlefield of the Greater East Asia War, surpassing the capabilities of the "Hayabusa" fighter.</p>
<p>*   The "Shoki" fighter has particularly high performance, with powerful climbing ability, maneuverability, and reinforcements that are better than the "Hayabusa" fighter.</p>
<p>*   The "Ryusei" is Japan's giant heavy bomber. It has flown in formations without the need for fighter escorts, crossing the rugged Arakan Mountains or penetrating deep into enemy territory, attacking enemy troops or breaking into New Guinea Island and Solomon Islands, which are infested with enemy fighters, dropping heavy bombs and repeatedly bombing enemy troops. Even when pursued by enemy fighters, this bomber can prevent their attacks and prevent them from getting close. In contrast, British and American bombers often rely on fighter escorts.</p>
<p>*   The "Si Tei" reconnaissance aircraft demonstrated its amazing reconnaissance power in the Malayan campaign and at landing sites such as Singapore and Sumatra. Although it was attacked by enemy Buffalo aircraft, its speed far exceeded that of enemy aircraft. In the Greater East Asia War, it provided a wealth of information for photographing enemy positions and other operations.</p>

<p>Argentine City, 18th (Central News Agency) – One hundred and twenty enemy aircraft participated in the U.S. Air Force's recent blind bombing of the Northern Kuril Islands, and the whereabouts of ten of them are unknown. According to a news report from the U.S. military front, most of the ten U.S. aircraft that returned were heavily damaged, and many pilots were also killed or injured. According to one of the U.S. Air Force personnel who survived, after experiencing many difficulties, they were able to return. One pilot talked about the situation of this air battle, saying that the U.S. Air Force engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese Air Force during the attack on the Northern Kuril Islands, and the U.S. Air Force suffered extremely heavy losses. Also, the Japanese military's anti-aircraft artillery fire was quite intense and accurate. According to another officer, this attack was unsuccessful like the air raids in Europe because there was no fighter assistance and the number of bombers was small.</p>

<p>Hankou, 18th (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen relief work after air raids, the Police Bureau has divided the city into eight districts, with the chiefs of each branch bureau as the general commander and bureau members or inspectors as the deputy general commander. All detailed methods and matters needing attention are currently being actively planned and are under review. Once completed and approved, they will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Hankou, 18th (Central News Agency) – The City Education Bureau has recently ordered all schools to strengthen their air defense equipment and protect students, as the urban area has been repeatedly blindly bombed by U.S. aircraft. They have also purchased a large number of first aid and medical supplies, which will be distributed to various primary and secondary schools for application starting on the 17th.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – In order to ensure military needs and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government is actively working on increasing food production and conserving consumption. In order to make the system reasonable and the allocation smooth, a Rice and Grain Control Committee has been formed to specialize in this matter. At the recent temporary meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, the “Measures for Implementing Rice and Grain Blockade in the Reclaimed Areas of the Yangtze River” were approved. For those transporting rice and grain products out of the reclaimed areas across the blockade line, the transport certificate must be certified by the Rice and Grain Control Committee and issued by the provincial or municipal government blockade management office, and co-signed by the relevant liaison officer in the area. After the promulgation of these measures, the control of rice will definitely be greatly effective. Because the transport of various rice and grains must be certified by the Rice and Grain Control Committee, the control committee will obtain accurate and clear information on the quantity and status of the rice and grain being transported, thus achieving the effect of control in allocation and utilization. The rice and grain transport certificates are issued by local governments and relevant agencies, so local governments are responsible for monitoring and ensuring rice and grain, so that grain cannot flow into bandit areas. The interim measures also stipulate penalty regulations for violators, so that workers and merchants in the reclaimed areas can jointly and earnestly follow the regulations and dare not violate the criminal laws, thus preventing corruption and other situations from occurring. Taken together, it can be seen that the promulgation of these measures will greatly benefit the National Government's two major policies of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In the future, our country's rice and grain control will definitely become more streamlined.</p>

<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to reliable sources, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox arrived in England by plane on the 17th. His visit to London is extremely secret, and military circles are paying close attention to it. It is said that this visit may be due to the end of the Mediterranean war, and is intended to discuss with the British side the cooperation between the British and American fleets for a new strategy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to sources in the anti-Axis countries, U.S. Chief of Staff Knox has arrived in London and is undertaking his first visit to London since the war. This visit may foreshadow important naval military decisions. Colonel Knox has held several meetings with Admiral Cunningham.

There is no doubt that General Mountbatten, who was recently appointed Commander of Southeast Asia, will participate in the upcoming meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Salerno Area Battles Enter Second Phase; Germany Controls Important Strongholds <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Berlin military, observing the Salerno area battles after the first week, commented that Marshal Kesselring has secured the initial victory of contact, and General Clark has experienced a severe defeat. In the Salerno area battles, the anti-Axis forces have lost a large portion of their landed troops and a massive amount of supplies. At this critical juncture, from a military and political standpoint, they are exhausting every available resource to maintain the Salerno beachhead, which the anti-Axis forces deem of great significance and are making great efforts to preserve. Berlin points out that the second phase of the Salerno battles is now beginning, with both sides reinforcing with large armies. The anti-Axis forces, reinforced by a portion of General Montgomery’s troops landing in the area to assist in the fighting, proves that the enemy is already in a desperate situation and has no choice but to rescue them with a large army. According to recent observation reports, the anti-Axis forces landing in the southern Gulf of Salerno have a real strength of one division. The battle in this area has become a triangular situation, with Salerno, Eboli, Gastertriebe, and Rigosa as its vertices. The most important strongholds on the front line are all occupied by German forces, and the German side has expanded to control the cities of Eboli, Alte Villa, and Albanira to the east of Salerno.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Unfold at Two Bridgeheads</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – American troops south of Eboli and British troops at the Salerno bridgehead are both rushing to reinforce their positions. A British tank battalion has also landed in the Salerno area. According to reliable sources, three out of the six American divisions that landed have been annihilated, and the remaining three divisions have also lost half of their soldiers and equipment. Without the cover of intense naval artillery fire, they would also be completely wiped out. The anti-Axis forces are sparing no expense in attempting to hold these two bridgeheads. In the past forty-eight hours, fierce battles have been constantly reported. The bridgehead in the Gulf of Salerno is being constantly reinforced. It was previously reported that three large convoys of anti-Axis escorts, totaling about sixty ships, sailed into the Gulf of Salerno on Thursday, which has been confirmed. There are currently ninety ships in the bay, totaling more than four hundred thousand tons. This indicates the development of the landing in the area. Montgomery's British Eighth Army has accelerated its march in the past twenty-four hours, evidently seeking to quickly establish contact with the American troops in Eboli.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Berle, the German News Agency correspondent stationed in Italy, reported that the situation in the southern area of Eboli remains unchanged, except that General Montgomery's reinforcements landed there on the night before September 17 to replace the American troops who suffered heavy casualties. On Thursday, General Clark's American Fifth Army, with the assistance of British reinforcements, launched a fierce attack on the wedge-shaped German forces. These wedge-shaped forces separated the bridgehead from the British and American landing groups in Salerno. German tank grenadiers are holding their ground everywhere in extremely fierce combat, preventing the enemy from establishing contact between the various bridgeheads. The estimated size of General Montgomery's troops, tank formations, and mechanized units landing at the American bridgehead is about one and a half divisions, which shows the severity of the American losses. It is expected that the American bridgehead will be reinforced by sea, as General Montgomery seems to understand that land travel is very slow because the German rearguard has made the nearby roads almost impassable.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the New York office of the Swiss Daily, American military sources believe that the anti-Axis forces will launch a counter-offensive operation in Burma from December this year to May next year, after the Burmese rainy season has passed. The appointment of Yate-Barton as commander of the Southeast Asian Army does not imply that preparations for operations in that region are already complete, but can only be regarded as the beginning of formal preparations. Before the anti-Axis forces can launch a large-scale offensive, they must find ways to solve major problems such as military supplies, medical facilities, and transportation. Other military experts believe that the above-mentioned difficulties can only be addressed after the Burmese rainy season, so the anti-Axis forces will have no choice but to carry out only small-scale operations this winter.</p>

The foreign ministries of the three countries are currently responsible for preparing the agenda for the conference.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Central News Agency – The Soviet Union is politically attempting to overwhelm Britain and the United States by using the Second Front issue. It has now obtained the right to speak on the Mediterranean Committee and has cultivated considerable influence in North Africa. German political circles believe that the Soviet Union also harbors great ambitions in the Balkans. In general, the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Balkans are becoming increasingly evident. The former Secretary-General of the Comintern, Dimitrov, once said that the anti-Axis side will soon cause Bulgaria to fall into the same trap as Italy. The Kremlin believes that the time has come for the Soviet Union to implement its claims in the Balkans. According to Yotong, Soviet generals have led guerrilla units into the territory of the former Yugoslavia, where they have been active in various places. Therefore, the Soviet Union's political activity in Eastern Europe is becoming more active. These facts prove the Soviet Union's intentions in Europe.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that after the Materials Investigation Committee investigated public and private warehouses of yarn and cloth, it continued to inspect knitting factories, and the process went very smoothly. The committee is now urging continued investigation into the inventory of yarn and cloth in dyeing and weaving factories and yarn and cloth stores in the city. According to reporters' inquiries to the committee, the yarn and cloth previously investigated were whether they had been registered with the Commercial Control Committee or were hoarded goods. Now that the yarn and cloth have been purchased by the National Government, and the deadline for applications for sale by yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders has passed, the investigation work must investigate whether the yarn and cloth stored by each yarn and cloth manufacturer has been declared for sale. If it is found that yarn and cloth have not been declared for sale, they will be sent to the judicial authorities for punishment in accordance with the law, and the smuggled goods will be confiscated by the Commercial Control Committee.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities have reduced the allocation price of cooking oil. The general public has expressed great approval for this decisive measure. As a result, the prices of other commodities will be unable to increase and will gradually decline. It is also reported that the cooking oil industry wholesale office yesterday earnestly urged retail stores to reduce prices. In addition to the 8th District, which has already started distribution, the 1st District also started distribution yesterday. As for Nanshi, Pudong, and other places, sales can be started next week.</p>
<p>Adulterated Oil Abounds</p>
<p>Due to material policies, the amount of cooking oil supplied to households in the city is limited, and most people feel that it is not enough, so they mostly buy more on the market. As a result, adulterated oils are abundant in the market, which is detrimental to health. It is heard that oil factories, aware of this situation, have specially dispatched key personnel to various production areas to find ways to purchase pure, high-quality, fragrant soybean oil and transport it to Shanghai for sale at reasonable prices in retail stores.</p>
<p>Difficult to Purchase Salt</p>
<p>In the next few days, 100,000 dan of edible salt will be shipped to Shanghai, which should cause the price of salt on the black market to fall. At the same time, a large amount of salt will continue to arrive here, which will be sufficient to supply the needs of the residents of the city. The firm steps taken by the salt allocation authorities in this port have reduced black market activity in salt. The Yù Mào official salt store has been approved by the authorities to sell official salt in designated salt stores in each district. Residents can go to purchase with their household registration certificate. This temporary salt allocation system, which is intended to supplement the lack of salt for residents and prevent hoarding and profiteering, will continue to be implemented until formal per capita salt distribution is realized. The official realization date is approximately at the beginning of next month. However, in recent days, it has still been difficult for the general public to purchase salt, and the amount is also insufficient. It is hoped that the official salt distribution methods can be improved.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Budding Era of Nursery School Movement <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The green route 26 public bus travels along the Western-style Great West Road. If you get off at Wangjia Lane before reaching Yidingpan Road, you can see a three-story garden house on your right, and beside the iron gate, in addition to the door number "66," there is a glorious sign that reads "Shanghai Nursery School, Organized by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)." Don't underestimate this small group; it's actually piloting a great new era undertaking of liberating women and cultivating talent!</p>
<p>The Undertaking of the Era</p>
<p>The term "nursery school" has only recently come to people's attention. In Shanghai, it's still a brand new endeavor, but it holds extremely significant meaning for society and the nation.</p>
<p>The most important factors in the advancement of world civilization are, first, to ensure that children receive scientific education and upbringing, so that they develop soundly in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills from an early age, laying the foundation for future contributions to society and the nation; and second, to liberate women and men from the confines of seclusion and the old system, allowing them to shoulder the responsibilities to society and the nation equally with men.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of children in our country grow up in dirty, dark, confused, and uneducated families, lacking modern education from an early age, and are unhealthy in both mind and body. At the same time, the vast majority of women in our country are suppressed by feudalism and patriarchal values, and even many who have received new education have not been able to completely break free. Especially after marrying and having children, although they have obtained the same civil rights as men and have the ambition to serve society and the nation, they are held back by family burdens and the children. These two phenomena are important factors in the lack of social progress.</p>
<p>Nursery schools are a new endeavor to eliminate these factors that hinder the progress of civilization. With the organization of nursery schools, many talented and ambitious women can rest assured and dedicate themselves to serving society and the nation, knowing that their children are well cared for. At the same time, infants or young children receive scientific nurturing in nursery schools, and both their bodies and minds are cultivated in a healthy manner, laying a foundation for national education.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution advanced human culture to a new level and also gave birth to the nursery school system. In recent times, the nursery school movement has flourished in civilized and powerful countries, especially in the Soviet Union and Germany. In our country, some forward-thinking places have been actively piloting the program and have achieved considerable success. In recent years, all people with ideas and ambition have felt interest and hope in the nursery school undertaking. The Shanghai YWCA Nursery School was born out of the needs of this new era.</p>
<p>Birth and Development</p>
<p>This was Shanghai in 1940, three years after the start of the war. The lives of ordinary people were becoming more and more difficult. The number of abandoned children along the roads was increasing day by day. "Who doesn't have children? How can they bear to see them abandoned on the roadside?" Moreover, the calamity of abandoning children is a loss for the future society! At that time, although charitable organizations such as the Catholic Orphanage, Renji Infants' Home, and Xinpu Nursery were working hard to provide relief to abandoned children, in reality, there were still many parents who could not afford to raise their children but were unwilling to abandon them, thus affecting their careers and futures. Tragedies were playing out on every street and in every alley. Some executives of the Shanghai YWCA, such as Ms. Bian Xusun and others, deeply felt that these tragedies must be stopped. Therefore, they studied the establishment of nursery schools to relieve these parents of the burden of their children, so they could boldly engage in undertakings that would benefit the society and the masses, without having to suffer guilt for abandoning their children, and without having to worry about their children not being educated. Moreover, they could still be reunited with their families in the future! What an ideal thing!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nursery School Preparatory Committee was established under this noble ideal. After discussions, planning, fundraising, and four months of tireless efforts, preliminary success was achieved. On March 1, 1941, Shanghai's first nursery school, the "Shanghai Nursery School, Organized by the YWCA," was born in Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nursery School, born in an era of hardship, lacked both funds and personnel. Furthermore, because the building was small, the scope of the undertaking could not be too large. The nursery school was a pioneering industry in Shanghai, and in order to gain understanding and trust from all sectors of society, it had to be run particularly well in order to make the nursery school movement widespread. The first priority was to maintain the health of the young children and avoid deaths. Therefore, the physical examination at the time of admission had to be particularly strict. The service was also limited to the children of the poorest workers. According to Ms. Bian, when she went to investigate and register the families of children requesting admission, she witnessed many tragedies. Some parents would lock their children in dirty, sweltering, and rat-infested rooms before going to work. She personally witnessed infants suffering from starvation and suffocation! During physical examinations, in addition to skin diseases being the most common, three or forty out of every hundred children had lung disease. These pitiful situations strengthened their determination to work hard for the nursery school undertaking.</p>
<p>Due to their efforts, the "Shanghai Nursery School" undertaking gradually attracted attention from all walks of life. On the one hand, the number of people sympathizing and providing assistance was increasing day by day. On the other hand, the need for nursery schools from all sectors of society was also increasing. Many middle-class families and young parents preparing to go far away to make a living began to try various methods to send their children to the nursery school. Although they were rejected after strict investigations, the actual needs of society also showed that the nursery school needed to be expanded urgently. But in December 1941, the Tongren Hospital site was requisitioned by the authorities, so they moved hastily and temporarily stayed at the YWCA headquarters on Gordon Road. It was not until March of last year that they found a more ideal location for the school at 66 Great West Road, with well-equipped buildings, gardens, lawns, air, light, and a surrounding environment that was conducive to the mental and physical development of young children.</p>
<p>Procedures and Rules</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nursery School started as a pioneering endeavor, especially adapted to the special conditions of Shanghai in recent times. They stipulated that the service goals were: to nurture children so that they would develop a healthy foundation in terms of physical and moral character from an early age, so that they could become useful talents for society and the nation when they grew up. At the same time, their direct goal was to help economically disadvantaged parents reduce their burden and help them obtain sufficient time and energy to develop their careers.</p>
<p>Due to limitations in manpower, material resources, and location during the start-up period, the following five conditions were stipulated for accepting children: 1. They must be the children of laborers whose parents' income cannot afford proper nurturing for the children; 2. They must be free from tuberculosis, venereal disease, and serious skin diseases as confirmed by a doctor's examination; 3. They must pass an intelligence test; 4. They must be introduced and guaranteed by a proper organization or impartial citizen and pass an investigation; 5. Those who must be entrusted due to special circumstances and who are confirmed to be in need of assistance through investigation. These are several basic conditions. The length of stay is limited to one year, and procedures must be completed to continue. Relatives of the children can visit on the 1st and 16th of each month in accordance with the school's rules.</p>
<p>The number of children accepted was initially limited to 30, from newborns to three years old, both boys and girls. At that time, the start-up cost was only 10,000 yuan, and the monthly expenditure was limited to 1,000 yuan. Everything was done with caution, in an attempt to achieve some success, not seeking too large a scale. As more and more people came to know about it, sympathetic and supportive people came one after another, and the social needs also increased day by day. Therefore, in June 1941, the quota was expanded to 50. After moving to the new location on Great West Road, the place was larger, there was a possibility of expansion, and with the assistance of enthusiastic people, the quota was expanded to 100 in July 1942, in response to the requests of those who registered. Although there have been some fluctuations since then, the fixed number has generally been maintained. There are now 68 boys and 38 girls, of whom 80% are half-orphans, and the remaining 20% ​​have parents but cannot afford to raise them, and even their older siblings are in other children's homes! Most of these children are directly entrusted through referrals, and some are sent by the former H. All children's protection departments. Although some children have been investigated before admission, fraud has still been found in practice, and those whose parents are still found to be capable of raising them are immediately sent back. Of course, it can also be seen from this how urgent the need for custody centers is in society! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Since taking over the concessions, regarding the construction of a New Shanghai and livelihood issues, we are willing to solicit public opinions as much as possible and offer them to the authorities for reference and adoption, working together to achieve the ideal Greater Shanghai City.

This second issue focuses on the "Grain Problem," and we encourage you to point out the shortcomings of the concession management system as much as possible, and to provide practical and specific countermeasures to address the root causes. The importance of the grain problem has been repeatedly emphasized by this newspaper, and everyone is familiar with it, so there is no need to elaborate.

<h3 id="e36">This Month's Rationed Sugar to be Available for General Sale Within the Month <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative has been continuously requesting the allocation of rationed sugar for September from the military distribution authorities. It is expected that general sales will be implemented within this month. As for the price issue, according to information obtained by our reporter from relevant authorities, there will be no changes. Rumors that the cooperative requested an increase are not consistent with the facts. Currently, the rationed sugar in this city is distributed by the military distribution combination, so the price should be reviewed and determined by the military distribution authorities in conjunction with relevant organizations. As for the reason for the delay in distributing this month's rationed sugar, it is because the current sugar industry association is responsible for distributing sugar to three provinces and two cities, and the prices must be the same everywhere, which has caused delays in the adjustment process. In short, with the efforts of the relevant authorities, the supply of sugar in this city can be smoothly continued and distributed on schedule.</p>

<p>Economic Circle: Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e45">Retaining the Average Amount of Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Buying and selling yarn and cotton cloth, buying rice, and revising the Special Criminal Law during Wartime are all the paths that must be taken to solve wartime economic problems. There is no doubt about victory. Even if there are ups and downs on the chosen path, they must be regarded as inevitable in the journey of economic recovery. Appropriate adjustments can be made from the side to achieve the goal of national economic recovery.</p>
<p>The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth should be an economic measure to benefit the people, not to strike at them. Therefore, we expect that the government will announce the implementation of the rationing of yarn and cloth and the start date. However, looking at it more broadly, our expectations may not stop there. Because the large amount of yarn and cloth purchased cannot be "inexhaustible." In addition to the prompt rationing of yarn and cloth after the purchase, it is also necessary to actively promote production increase plans to ensure that the supply of materials is never in short supply. Therefore, the raw material problem in all key production areas has become the core of the production increase problem.</p>
<p>Taking cotton textile production as an example, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, each factory and retailer should be allowed to retain an average amount equivalent to one month's total sales or consumption in the first half of this year. It is certainly an appropriate remedy to ensure that yarn and cloth manufacturers retain the average amount of yarn and cloth. It should be noted that an excessive amount of raw materials will prevent production from proceeding, because raw materials are more expensive than finished products, so manufacturers will hold on to raw materials, and production will decrease further. However, an insufficient amount of raw materials will also prevent production from proceeding, because manufacturers, although unable to engage in large-scale hoarding, can excuse themselves by the lack of raw materials and not engage in production. Therefore, retaining the average amount of yarn and cloth is the most reasonable method. The only question is how to thoroughly support the method.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Shanghai Market Overview After the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Most Merchants are Selling Goods at Reduced Prices; Speculators are in Dire Straits <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Since the government authorities implemented the strict measure of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the situation in the local market has changed dramatically, and the abnormal prosperity caused by speculation and hoarding in the past has been completely swept away. According to our reporter's investigation, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Industry: Although the purchase of yarn and cloth has not had any apparent impact on the banking industry, the actual impact is unknown to outsiders. It is no exaggeration to say that a portion of the local financial industry has been built on merchants' speculation and hoarding in the past. The number of banks that can use funds for legitimate production investment is very rare. Before the yarn had been purchased, some banks accepted yarn and cloth mortgages from speculators, which was a considerable amount. Once the yarn and cloth were purchased by the government, the speculators went bankrupt, and they were unable to repay the loans they had mortgaged. Therefore, the banks suffered losses. Although the financial community has been trying to find ways to make up for the losses in recent days, it is difficult to predict the extent to which they can make up for them. In addition, due to the authorities' suppression of prices, speculators have suffered huge losses, and the market is extremely tight. Sales have stalled, and the business of various banks and money houses has become sluggish. As a result, many small banks have been in a state of outwardly strong but inwardly weak. In the past, the number of small banks in the local area sprang up like mushrooms after rain, but now no one is willing to establish new banks anymore.</p>
<p>Retailers:</p>
<p>Retailers in all industries, whether they are department stores or cigarette paper shops, have been hoarding materials during the past era of soaring prices. Customers who came to the door to shop were often met with the contempt of the shop assistants. Because in the vortex of rising prices day and night, customers who went to buy an item were equal to depriving the shop of the profits from the price increase. Therefore, the shop owners would rather store the goods than sell them to customers, and would not provide any convenience. However, after the purchase of yarn and cloth, various department stores have either been affected by the extreme tightness of money or fear that they will follow in the footsteps of yarn and cloth. They have all changed their styles and started selling at reduced prices, even calling for sales with large discounts and large gifts. The price cuts are often lower than the price limits set by the authorities. All kinds of fabrics and other foreign groceries have this phenomenon. Therefore, the situation is so miserable that it is difficult for outsiders to understand.</p>
<p>Speculators:</p>
<p>There are many speculators in Shanghai. Our country's industry is backward, and it has never been able to get on the right track. Merchants make profits by speculation as the only shortcut. No one is willing to invest their funds in production. This trend has become even more pronounced since the war. Therefore, the funds in the market have actually become the main force in the speculative market, and most of them are unwilling to participate in production. The speculative methods can be roughly divided into two major categories: one is that individuals use their funds to engage in kicking the ball transactions, and the other is to set up a nest-word question to conduct speculative transactions, with varying scales, but their methods are the same regardless of size. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, individual kicking the ball transactions had basically stopped. After the festival, the writing questions that specialized in speculative purchases were also in a dire situation where there was no opportunity to speculate. Therefore, the market in Shanghai today is not as active as it used to be.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The First District Government Considers Daily Necessities Rationing Method, Starting with Salt, Soap, and Matches <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The First District Government of this city, in view of the fact that the prices of various daily necessities in this city have not decreased due to the government's strict crackdown on hoarding and price suppression, has decided to implement the rationing of daily necessities to households in the short term for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The rationing plan is being carefully planned and is expected to be drafted and announced before the end of this month and implemented starting in October. It is reported that the first batch of daily necessities to be rationed will be temporarily set as "salt, soap, and matches." The rationing method will be to issue purchase coupons according to the baojia household registration, so that citizens can use the coupons to purchase a certain amount of goods from designated stores within a certain period of time. After the rationing system for these three daily necessities is established and implemented, the relevant authorities will gradually expand the scope of rationing. It is reported that the current Materials Investigation Committee is stepping up its investigation of hoarded materials in all public and private warehouses in Shanghai. After the entire investigation is completed, the government authorities can expand the scope of material purchases and use the materials purchased as rationing.</p>

<p>Chinese Stock Market Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks started out flat and sluggish, but sharply turned firm at noon. Recently, prices had fallen a lot, and investors were eager to move. Moreover, the vigor of financial stocks in the past few days greatly stimulated public confidence. Although it was still the repayment period, trading was not quiet. Among the rising financial stocks, Continental Bank continued to lead, soaring upwards amidst buying pressure. Shanghai, Zhe Xing, Jin Cheng, Yanye, and Zhong Yi all saw their prices rise. The price of Wing On Co. in the department store sector fluctuated around the previous day's price, but suddenly surged upwards at noon. Sincere returned to level after falling.

In the textile industry, Dasheng factories 1 and 3 each made progress. Wing On Textile returned to level after being weak, as did Guangqin and Qingfeng Textile. Dafeng Dyeing rose considerably. Meyer, Shin Lee, Hung Shen, Great China Weaving, and Meyer Laine still remained in a flat and sluggish situation. Sin Zao Lo and Sin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory stopped their decline and turned firm. Wuzhou, Zhongxi, Ou Jin Ying, and Sin Sing Pharmaceutical Factory were all slightly lower, but pulled up by buyers. However, Sino-French remained weak. In the cultural industry, Chung Hwa and World Book Co. were slightly lower, while Commercial Press remained stagnant. In the public utility sector, only Shanghai Electric Power suffered a slight setback. Chapei Water &amp; Electric and Public Electric remained stagnant.

China Union and Wing Hing's trading rose to the same price as the previous day. In the food stock sector, Biao Chi MSG suddenly sustained heavy losses due to buyer damage. Guanshengyuan, Mei Lin, and Fumin Dairy showed no glory or disgrace. Kang Yuan Canned Food showed a slight [illegible]. In the family industry, Three Friends Industrial and Great China Rosin were firm and stable with no lack of buyers. Great China Matches and British-American Tobacco Company both showed little change. Wah Cheong was more chaotic and lower than yesterday.</p>
<p>Business News in Brief</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market for unified government bonds was quite firm, but softened slightly midway. Later, a general buying party took advantage of the low prices to absorb a large amount, and gradually rose to courage by noon. As a result, Grade C bonds rose one level again, while Grade A, B, and E all saw increases, and trading was quite brisk.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rates: The Shanghai Money Exchange Association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at 19%.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: The trend is still strong, and both buyers and sellers feel quite active. Sales in other regions continue, so the market is tight. Sales of Great British and Old Knife brand cigarettes are quite smooth, so the market continues to rise. The prices of other cigarettes have not changed much due to slow sales.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Analysis of Germany's War Power <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Tadataka Ikezaki</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>It cannot be said that there are absolutely no people who are uneasy about the recent European war situation and its future, especially among the intellectuals in Japan. Their knowledge of military affairs and war may not be abundant, but starting from the nervous sensitivity unique to the intellectual class, when judging the general trend of the war, they do not study its final shift, but rather focus on the results of local battles, thus rashly forming a comprehensive view of the war. Because of this tendency, they become even more skeptical about the European war situation and its future.</p>
<p>The European war situation is not optimistic. Frankly speaking, since the major retreat of the German army on the Eastern Front, the Axis banner in Europe cannot be something we cheer for. In particular, the situation in the Mediterranean theater after the retreat of the Axis forces from North Africa, since the Anglo-American forces occupied Pantelleria and Lampedusa, and then occupied Sicily, and soon developed into the recent landings on mainland Italy, this situation is naturally becoming increasingly dangerous for the Axis.</p>
<p>In addition, on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army, having recovered Orel, Kharkov, and Belgorod, is still actively continuing its offensive. The situation thereafter cannot be decisively said to be unfavorable to the Soviet army. Therefore, if one focuses on the results of local battles every day, and wants to form a comprehensive view of the war situation based on this, then it cannot be said that those who are anxious about the recent European war situation and its future are necessarily caused by nervous sensitivity.</p>
<p>Victory or defeat is not determined by local battles. However, the outcome of modern warfare is definitely not determined by the results of local battles. The European war, which has lasted for four years, is becoming increasingly complex in nature. The trend of the war has long since escaped the realm of being determined by the capture of a single city or pool, or by the victory or defeat of sporadic battles. Therefore, when observing, one must broaden one's horizons and deeply understand the true nature of the war.</p>
<p>The current European war situation can be roughly divided into two situations. One is the Eastern Front, which stretches for two thousand li, and the other is the Mediterranean Front, which has recently unfolded at the southern end of the Italian peninsula. These two fronts have no direct connection in themselves. The main forces facing each other on their fronts are the German army against the Soviet army on one side, and the German army against the Anglo-American forces on the other. Therefore, when forming a so-called comprehensive view of the European war situation, it is necessary to distinguish between the two and observe them separately.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to first investigate the German-Soviet front in the east. When investigating its trend, the existence of Britain and the United States will be temporarily ignored. Simply treating this as a war between Germany and the Soviet Union, not being bound by the various details that make up the current war situation, examining the matter from a more fundamental and essential point of view, avoiding all subjectivity, and calmly examining the positions of the two sides, we will examine which of the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, maintains a more favorable position.</p>
<p>Comprehensive war power can lead to victory. As I see it, the current stage of the German-Soviet war has lost the characteristics of the first and second phases of the war, and has reached a stage where the final victory or defeat is determined solely by the superiority or inferiority of their comprehensive war power. The things that can be regarded as their comprehensive war power are, first, military strength; second, military supplies production capacity; third, food self-sufficiency; and fourth, the national spiritual strength that can endure war and fear.</p>
<p>As for the current strength of the German army, I am afraid no one knows the exact number. Hanson Baldwin estimates it to be 350 to 360 divisions, while Soviet intelligence claims there are 302 divisions. But no matter what the actual number is, the strength of the German army exceeds that of the Soviet Union, and there is no room for doubt.</p>
<p>The population of the Soviet Union is about twice that of Germany. The consumption since the start of the war has been enormous, and the Soviet Union itself is the only source of military strength. On the other hand, Germany has consumed very little since the start of the war, and has many satellite countries around it. There is reason to speculate that the military strength provided by these countries is quite large, and compared to the Soviet Union, Germany occupies a very favorable position.</p>
<p>The current Axis forces, in addition to the main German and Italian forces, also have troops from Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Hungary, and Slovakia. Hanson Baldwin estimates the total strength of these countries to be about 30 divisions, but based on the reality of the previous World War, this estimate seems too small. I believe that the total strength of the Axis forces in Europe is currently close to 10 million, while the opposing Soviet army is about 9 million.</p>
<p>Germany has the advantage in military supplies production. As for the production capacity of military supplies, Germany certainly has the advantage. Germany itself has a large production organization, plus the steel industry of Luxembourg, the precision industry of Belgium, and the military industry of Czechoslovakia, and can also mobilize the industrial power of France. The main purpose of the Anglo-American bombing of the Ruhr area and Hamburg is to reduce their production capacity. This has not yet had a fatal effect on Germany.</p>
<p>Due to the relocation of factories to the interior, the mobilization of the old and young, and the extraordinary production methods of the Stakhanov movement, the Soviet Union seems to have maintained more production capacity than imagined. But no matter what, not only did it lose the major industrial areas in the Donbas soon after the start of the war, but also when compared with Germany, which has 7 million foreign laborers, the source of its labor force is also extremely scarce, and it is ultimately no match for Germany. Of course, it can obtain some materials through the Iranian route, the Arctic route, and the Siberian Railway, but to say that this can make up for the Soviet Union's disadvantage in production capacity, I am afraid no one would think so.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union's military strength resources, as Dr. Harding said, are exhausted to the point where it has to conscript Outer Mongolians on the border. The Soviet Union's military supplies production capacity, as Willkie pointed out, is like Skoda, New Hsinneki, Kenez, and Swiertierfsk, all kinds of styles being displayed together. Therefore, judging from these aspects, the superiority or inferiority of Germany and the Soviet Union is clear at a glance. (Excerpt from the Tokyo Yomiuri Report of September 8)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Starting with the Treatment of Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Jinzhao</p>
<p>What is the noblest and most sacred profession in society? It is teaching. What is the lowest-paid profession in society? It is teaching. These two contradictory phenomena exist universally throughout the country. With the deepening of the contradiction, China's education has already reached a serious crisis. We often hear many parents complaining, "My child's level is poor!" "The teacher is often absent!"... Our education practitioners also admit that the level of children is getting worse year by year, partly because teachers are "double-minded" and cannot fully take responsibility: the main reason is that the teachers are of poor quality. I dare to say boldly that many low-level class teachers in Shanghai are only junior high school students in terms of academic qualifications. As the saying goes, "A good teacher produces excellent students." If the teacher is not good, how can the student be excellent? In the final analysis, it is entirely because the treatment is too poor, and even personal life cannot be maintained, not to mention anything else.</p>
<p>Before the war, the treatment of Shanghai municipal elementary school teachers was better. A high school normal school graduate received a monthly salary of 50 yuan. Every three years of service at the original school, the rank was promoted once, and the salary was increased by 5 yuan, which was an excellent system. After this incident, the initial teacher's monthly salary was 30 yuan, the head teacher's was 40 yuan, and the principal's was 50 yuan, which was already meager. At that time, 6 yuan a month was enough for food. A salary of 30 yuan could barely maintain a small family life. As the level of living increased, the salary gradually increased, but as of July of this year, the salary of municipal elementary school teachers was only 220 yuan. There was news of a salary increase in August, but it has not yet been realized. Looking at this amount of money, calculated as 30 days a month, the hard work earned each day is less than 7.4 yuan, which is only enough to buy seven pancakes, not enough for two bowls of Yangchun noodles. Of course, there are many altruists in the education sector who can obtain life security from their families, but there are more elementary school comrades who have been struggling in the vortex of life, without a chance to catch their breath. If the income is not enough to keep warm and fed, how can they concentrate on cultivating the future masters of the country? In recent years, I have seen teachers who have received normal school training leave one after another, either to study, or to enter politics, or to wear leather belts, or to become street vendors. I truly have a feeling of "a mixture of emotions, not knowing whether to laugh or cry." According to what I know now, the average salary of private elementary schools in Shanghai is better than that of public schools, generally around 500 yuan, but I don't know how far away it is from maintaining a family life. Therefore, teachers in public and private elementary schools throughout the city feel the urgent need to increase their treatment:</p>
<p>Regarding the standard of teacher treatment, I remember reading in Educational Theory that "The treatment of elementary school teachers should be based on twice the cost of living for food, clothing, housing, and transportation in the local area!" If the cost of living for an individual in this city is 500 yuan, then the monthly salary of an elementary school teacher should be at least 1,000 yuan. Maintaining a small family with 1,000 yuan is already a frugal life.</p>
<p>According to last year's statistics, there are a total of 113 schools, 1,144 teachers and staff in the city's private elementary schools and public elementary schools. These more than 1,000 elementary school teachers are distributed in every corner of the city, and bear a very important cultural mission. Their monthly income is not enough to keep warm and fed, and society's treatment of elementary school teachers can be described as alarming. Now, taking 1,000 yuan as the standard, each person needs an increase of about 770 yuan. The monthly expenditure of the municipal education bureau on primary education must increase by 880,000 yuan. The source of funds is a problem worth studying.</p>
<p>Generally, people have a misconception that the Finance Bureau is a production agency, while the Education Bureau is a consumption agency. In fact, to enrich the country and strengthen the military, the people must have abundant knowledge. Otherwise, they will lag behind everywhere, and how can they compete in modern border disputes and win? In the past, the political system was not on track, and the call for independent education funding was very loud. However, "education" and "finance" have clear boundaries, and we cannot allow them to be confused. After the war, education funding was insufficient, and with the help of Mayor Yu, a feast donation was established, extracting 10%. Initially, merchants contracted for 30,000 yuan per month. Later, it was run independently, with a revenue of about 200,000 yuan, all of which was used to subsidize education expenses. Now that the concession has been taken over and the local administration has been unified, the feast donation can be extended to the First and Eighth Districts. If the total daily turnover of the city is 1 million yuan (probably more), a donation of 100,000 yuan can be extracted, totaling 3 million yuan per month. In addition to increasing the salaries of municipal elementary school teachers, it will definitely promote education throughout the city. We can see a fresh look in Shanghai's education sector.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing treatment, we also hope that the Municipal Education Bureau will care about the poverty of colleagues in the education sector, understand their difficulties, and consult with the relevant authorities to comprehensively provide daily necessities such as rice, coal, cloth, sugar, and salt, so that everyone serving in the education sector will recognize education as a lifelong career, and sound teachers will not leave. Indirectly, the national cultural level will also gradually improve. It is said that the establishment of education associations in famous districts throughout the city has been very competitive. I hope that the elected executives will truly do something, seek welfare for colleagues in the education sector, and make a reasonable struggle for the treatment of elementary schools!</p>
<p>The third session of the Zeng De Commercial Obligation Night School has begun to enroll students. The school is scheduled to start on September 25. Tuition is free, and a deposit of 30 yuan is collected (to be returned at the end of the semester). Registration time is every night from 7:00 to 9:00 pm. The school address is Guangshi Middle School, 270 Chengdu Road. The Zhengying Elementary School at 287 Route Dollfus, in order to raise funds to assist poor students, has specially invited Professor Wei Zhongle, a famous domestic national musician, and his Chinese Grand Orchestra to perform at the auditorium of Aurora University on September 12. All the programs are extremely profound and precious.</p>

<p>The Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, is well aware of the hardship of living for salaried classes, and especially the poor teachers. Therefore, it has specially stipulated that poor teachers can receive free examinations. The method is to send patients for consultation every day (except for holidays) from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Poor female teachers who are giving birth, holding a certificate from this newspaper, will only be charged a registration fee of 50 yuan, and all other hospitalization expenses will be free, to show special preferential treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Charity Schools and Scholarships <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Pei Pei Academy at 70 Min Village, Route Minety in the Eighth District, in order to cultivate poor children and prevent them from dropping out of school, has specially increased the number of half-fee students by 30.

<p>The Shanghai Youyou Nursery, due to financial difficulties, held a fundraising committee at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant a few days ago. More than 20 people attended, including directors of the nursery Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, Zhang Wenkui, and Chen Chunhua. The discussion on fundraising and the improvement of children's education was very detailed. It was also decided that the president Lin Kanghou and Zhang Jusheng would invite the press for a tea party at 2:00 pm on the 18th, and it was decided to start fundraising on October 1, with a target of 800,000 yuan. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously.</p>
<p>Lost Child Notice: The Nanyang Hospital in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, took in a lost Wu girl the night before last. She is about eight years old, wearing a blue short shirt and white shorts. It is hoped that the girl's parents will come to claim her.</p>
