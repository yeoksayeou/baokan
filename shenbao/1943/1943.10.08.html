<p>社評</p>
<h3>論政治的出路</h3>
<p>我們論及加强中日協力問題以至促成全面和平，會力主以實現和平區內政治修明爲前提。我們一向主張，惟有政治修明，則一切國策之貫澈始有保證，不致落空。然而如何始能使政治眞正修明？似應爲今日當國者所宜虛心研究，博採輿情，以謀迅速的解決。</p>
<p>一般人談論政治得失，往往只注目於政府當局之意見與動態，往往只注目於一時的實力派之意見與動態，亦即祇知重視一時的表面的現象，而忽視國家政治之歷史的動力，忽視國家政治力量所繋之民衆心理的動向，這可說是今日論政者所應猛省的一點。我們研究中外歷史，某一時代政治之得失，以這一時代民衆心理的動向而衡斷；某一統治者政策之成敗，及其政治生命之久暫，不決於政治權術乃至堅甲利兵，不決於旣成政治勢力之動態，也須取決於廣大民衆心理之向背。以殷商實力之强，而被舉兵於八十里地之周王所顛覆，以贏秦聲勢之盛，尙不免失敗於起身隴畝之陳涉及泗上一亭長的劉邦之手，主要的原因，就在乎前者徒擁威權而不知把握民衆心理，後者則能認識此決定國家政治之潛勢力的民衆力量，而獲得成功。我國歷史上，雖知把握民心之重要而嘗試失敗的，可說是不勝列舉。如西漢末葉的王莽，爲中國一大政治家，當時能認識時代潮流，實行變法，可說是已經認識政治潛勢力之民衆心理。然而畢竟失敗，共失敗之原因在於本身政治目的纂竊的錯誤，而爲民衆所離棄。其後宋代王安石之變法，同樣爲把握民衆心理的政治運動，共政治目標也比王莽忠實，可惜又因爲未能廣泛寬大的吸收眞正的人材，終爲反對派所湮沒。直到淸末康梁之倡導變法維新及孫中山先生之領導革命運動，開始了解和把握到民衆的心理。</p>
<p>由於時代潮流的演進，近代政治的出路，不僅承襲歷史的法則，必須把握廣大民衆的向心力，同時，更須注意於靑年心　的把握。一個政府，必須具備把握住一般民衆與靑年羣衆的心理，政治才算找到出路，才能走上軌道。然而，事實上靑年的思想比較銳進，不但常站在時代的尖端，甚且超過時代，因此，滿足靑年的政治要求，不是容易做到的事，我們姑且暫置不談。不過要求目前政治上軌道，旣然絕對必要，那未，它的出路，第一步唯有集中在如何爭取民心，把握民心。</p>
<p>然則，如何爭取民心與把握民心呢？最迫切的就是給予老百姓「安居樂業」。也許有人疑問，目前世界正在戰爭中，講安居樂業，似乎是奢望，因爲在戰時，政府必須要求人民吃苦犧牲？而人民對國家的責任也是吃苦犧牲。當然，這是無庸辯解的，不過，吾人所言安居樂業，決不同於所謂享受，而只是要求政治上軌道，社會安定，老百姓能各安其業，各盡其力。更具體的說，就是要求政治修明，肅淸貪汙；要吃苦，要犧牲，那麽大家都來吃苦犧牲，決不能有例外，更決不許利用戰時而造成少數人升官發財的機會。古人所說不患寡而患不均，只要不均的現象消除之後，那麽社會可以安定，老百姓也可安居了。至於樂業，不僅不是享受，而且是要使老百姓都有爲國家獻身工作的機會，不過現在是不是能够滿足這種要求呢？言工業，資金之融通，原料之配給，技術之扶助，動力之供應，運輸之便利，凡所以使工業家樂業者，究竟做到了幾分？言農業，則土地法之改善，田賦苛雜之輕减，灌溉水利之修整，貸款與農具肥料之供應，農產品尤其是食糧價格之穩定，可使農人樂業者，又究竟做到了幾分？此外如正當商業之維護，公敎人員生活之改善，社會事業之推行，凡所以使人民各盡其力各樂其業者究竟做到了幾分？中國老百姓所要求的安居樂業，其具體內容，不過如是，我們深信，這種要求，決不能謂爲過分，爲奢望，亦決不同於享受。以友邦日本爲例，如果未具備安居樂業的條件，那得使人民一致翼贊其政府與國策，而達到戰爭有利形勢的結果？我們今日如果不先努力做到使人民安居樂業這一步，那麽不要說將來如何建國，就是今日迫急要求的加强中日協力爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，也不免變成一句空話！</p>
<p>今天要講加强中日協力，爭取大東亞戰爭勝利，要講促進全面和平統一建設新中國，第一步必須使老百姓安居樂業，這樣才是政治上的出路，才能使政治上軌道，一切國策也才因此而得以貫澈。最主要的是澄淸吏治，消滅一切虛偽腐敗的舊風氣。昔日孔子由大司寇攝相事，立誅少正卯以維正氣，以明是非而正人心，以警姦邪而勵忠良，雖少正卯之聲勢傾天下，炙手可熱，而孔子不之顧，魯國卒以致治，後之視今，何異今之視昔，敢問今日有此賢能大勇的政治家否？</p>

<h3>菲島將宣告獨立　洛勒爾任大總統　憲法草案全文昨正式發表</h3>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　菲島獨立準備委員會委員長洛勒爾，七日上午十一時發表：菲島獨立之必要準備手續已告竣事，即定於一九四三年十月十四日宣告獨立，特此聲明，當此機會，余切望全菲烏人民有所覺悟，各以熱意明待逹成多年神聖夙願之光榮之日到來，一九四三年十月七日，菲律賓獨立準備委員會委員長洛勒爾於馬尼刺。按菲島千八百萬人民之獨立夙願，於茲已可指日達成，「菲律賓共和國」亦將以東亞道義國家之一，而出現於世界。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　菲律賓自大東亞戰爭勃發後，已脫離美國之羈絆，而獻力於建設東亞新秩序，茲更將於十月十日四日宣告獨立，由洛勒爾博士就任第一任大總統。新菲島由菲律賓憲法章案闡明，乃係基於和平自由道義而　獻於創造世界新秩序之共和團體，在第一任大總統領導下，向完成新生菲烏，建設大東亞共榮　之途邁進。菲律賓之獨立，在日本支援下，即將具體實現，較美國過去三年為期之口約尤早，此實日本逆義精神之衷現，菲島一千八百萬民衆莫不期待光榮之日來臨，舉國　歡，而更一新其決意也。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　新生菲島乃大東亞共榮圈之一環，負有建設東亞及世界新秩序之重要使命，此次發表之菲律賓共和國憲法，即其根本法，乃由菲島獨立準備委員會憲法起草委員會委員長洛勒爾氏起草編成，自本年六月以來，集結全菲島民衆總意，多次愼重檢討結果，至九月三日憲法草案始起草竣事，四日於獨立準備委員會席上全體一致通過，故於六七兩日召開全島代表大會，履行承認憲法草案手續，決定菲島之憲法草案，於七日正式發表，該菲律賓共和國憲法之基本精神，於全文中已闡明（全文共分十二條八十八項），規定親生菲島乃共和政體，國號為菲律賓共和國，明示菲島政府決基於自由和平及道義貢獻於創造世界秩序，與舊憲法不同，乃以建設道義世界秩序為最高理念，而成為大東亞共榮圈之一員，其特性有二：　置重點於行政方面，以大總統為政治責任者，採用三權分立主義，故立法機關採一院制，憲法條文之排列，亦以行政立法開發中心法為序，且極重視人民義務，因此可實現政治權構之簡單强力化。　關於天然資源之開發及對目前現狀表明應於大東亞戰後加以全面改正，為此於千八百萬菲島民衆之總意下，已充分表示欲解放菲島之熱意，菲律賓共和國憲法，乃以貢獻建設東亞新秩序之崇高精神為根據，於　完成，仍向全世界闡明菲島建設道義國家之偉業。</p>
<h3>日陸軍機隊　最近戰績一斑　桂林韶關建甌遭轟炸</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日軍某基地七日電，日精銳　軍機隊，於十月二日會空襲建甌，繼於四日五日兩日，急襲桂林。此外另一部隊，四日並會進攻渝第七戰區司令部所在地韶關，轟炸各機塲滑行路中，軍事設施，茲誌日陸軍機隊最近進襲狀况如次：　十月二日，轟炸機隊連續兩次空襲建甌，將該地機塲滑行路　毀。十月四日，復以强力之戰鬥　，轟炸機聯合編隊，奋襲桂林。十時四十二分，進入兩機塲上空，將該機塲南側之附　設備，房霍積軍　物資倉庫等炸毀，予以極大損害。於歸途中有敵「P35」型　機一架，尾追戰鬥機隊之一部，「P40」型機二架尾追轟炸機隊，日機當即對之反擊，敵機立刻逃去。　另一强力轟炸　隊，於四日午十時廿五分，進攻韶關，轟炸市內軍事設施，炸毀停於站內之貨車十二輛，十月五日，日軍强力戰鬥機隊，復於十一時進攻桂林兩飛機塲，搜索敵機，而日機隊主力終未遭遇敵機，另一部發現敵「P40」型機數架逃走，乃以少數機對之攻擊，擊落其一架。於是日之攻擊中日機有一架未歸返。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日軍某苦地七日電，日陸軍機隊於四五兩日往襲桂林時，敵機因日機近來積極勇敢之攻擊戰，竟已潛伏匿跡，僅於日機歸返　虛示尾追，故作　勢，故日轟炸機隊在戰鬥機護衛下，未受任何抵抗。投巨强轟炸其倉庫，及其他軍事設施，獲得所期之戰果。於四日第一次轟炸時，指揮者某部隊長，於歸還基地後，會談攻擊之狀况稱，我機進抵目標上空後，轟炸機隊當即勇敢轟炸軍需倉庫羣及其他軍事設施。敵近最機似欲保持勢力，而汲汲退　，故戰鬥機隊未獲　落敵機之戰果。</p>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　據渝電稱，日軍機隊二日會連續兩次空襲建甌，於四日更以大編隊空襲韶開兩地，俱蒙相當損害，且謂日軍今後仍將繼續進攻。</p>
<p>空襲逐川</p>
<p>東日中央社電　據某某地七日電，日陵軍航空部隊，於六日以戰鬥機轟炸機聯合大編隊，空襲美駐渝空軍前進某地　省西南部之逐川。是日上午八時五十五分，猛炸該處機塲之格納庫時，旋發見前來邀　之敵「P40」型機十餘架，當即予以攻擊。　開　烈空戰歷二直分鐘，其中敵機二架，中彈吐出白煙，似被擊落中，但未證實。是役日機亦有二架自炸。</p>
<h3>粤省舉行　糧食會議</h3>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　粤省府於五日召開全省糧食增產　進會議，由陳省長主席，訓示此次會議之中心要點。十時正開始會議，陳中委壁君，親臨指導。由汪兼局長主席，廣州市長汕頭市長南海縣長等，分別報告各該地糧食槪况。按此次會議中心要點共為三項：　如何施行糧食統制，及如何健全各市縣糧食機構。　如何進進倉儲制度，調節各縣民食。</p>
<h3>新興菲律賓　國旗含義</h3>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　即將成立之新興國家菲律賓共和國國詐旗，今已決定，新國旗乃根據一八九八年阿基那爾德將軍於加比得所揭之獨立國旗而判定，近旗竿處為白色等邊三角，其餘部份分為上青下紅二色，三角形中配以太陽及三個五角星。白色象徵清高思相與道義，紅色旬徵勇氣與決心，青色象徴希望與崇高之理想，太陽與星象徵獨立菲律賓永久之光榮與命運，太陽光芒象徵一八九六年呼應鮑　亞修革命而倔起之呂宋八州，星象徵呂宋·棉闌·比薩牙三地方，三角形之各邊，象徵三地方之平等權利。此代表菲律賓民族理想傳統歷史光榮之國旗之理生乃菲島民衆多年之願望，故獨立準備委員會特以此代表菲律賓共和國，此本科生基那爾德將軍所創制之旗，在美統制菲島時代，會一度以法律禁止使用，後至一九一九年始許可使用，以迄戰前，然祇為從屬於美國國旗之下者，今則已完全成為眞正代表菲島人民之國旗。</p>
<h3>公務員犯治罪　條例將公布　中政會決議即行制定</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　一國政治之修明，端賴於公務員之是否廉潔，故務員之貪汚與否，實有關繫　個國家之政治。國府還都後，即注重廉潔政治，附此參戰期間，公務員是否廉潔，更有關戰時體制。因此關於公務員貪汚事件，七日中政會議通過，擬制定公務員犯　治罪條例。由此可見政府對公務員貪汚事件如何重視。此種條例，業已交法制專門委員會，立法司法兩院，及司法行政部，會同制定，於兩星期筆卽可以布，公布之後，當可見諸實施，預料今後政治當益明朗，而更適合戰時體制</p>

<h3>華北河渠建設　分期實施</h3>
<p>北平七日中央社訉　華北河渠建設委員會，自第一次　進新建設工作，熟烈展開後，　於全華北河渠之管理警衛，及農田水利之振興等工作，即鎭密計劃，並急謀推進。為早日促在建設之實施，以期富國裕民，而完成華北產業基地　見，該委員會　遵照政務委員會，　頒佈之第一次促進新建高實施要綱，制定實施方案，分三期依次進行。</p>
<h3>德軍在愛琴海　續佔兩島嶼　義東部戰事趨緊張</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據安加拉來電　德軍已佔領愛琴海　　羅（Lesros）島，同時並於薩摩斯）（Samos）島登陸，與英軍及巴特里奧軍交戰中。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社軍事記　塞托留斯稱：義南戰綫不部，戰事漸趨緊張。蒙高茂萊顯已將其主力　至右翼亞特里亞海岸，以聲援在巾木里登陸之英軍。德軍兵力亦已詨　週　之平均數為增加，但德軍主力之出動，是否為改拖延戰為積極防　戰，現尚不能斷言。凱塞林上將將於何時地出動主力應戰，仍雖　數方協摸。至於英第八軍之左翼仍侷處貝尼文托福查鐵路以北之山嶺間　進展極微，猶未越聖巴杜洛米沃，該處西南即為美軍之右翼，其先鋒僅抵貝尼文托與波特闌多爾福，及卡勒爾河南聞風而動與蒙特沙齊沃之半途，協約軍激戰綫自此向西直扺那不勒斯以北之蒂倫尼安海岸。在上述諸戰綫中，僅有敵兵一營或一連之小活動，無非在從事試探而已。惟在那不勒以北，美軍有重砲隊集中，克拉克將軍殆將在該處發動新攻勢亦未可知。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德元首行營六日戰報稱：南義戰綫反軸必軍會以數中隊乃至數大隊，數次攻擊德軍後衛，但德軍予以重大損傷將其　退。德軍猛　在帖木里登陸之反軕心軍坦克車及裝甲車羣，並擊沉敵三千噸　上之大型登陸舟艇三艘。　伊斯特里亞地方剿匪作戰，德軍鹵俘甚多，予遊　隊以大損害。</p>
<h3>法西斯共和政府　決遷義北部　羅馬保持不設防城市</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據羅馬消息：傳義法西斯共和政府，擬由羅馬遷往北義之某地。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　福爾斯特博士在柏林金融報發表謂，義政府自羅馬遷往北部，實因戰事之影響而引起政治重心之遷移。義政府此舉，乃係自動重要之決定，並非受敵軍壓迫有所遷移者，實因義國抗戰之主要根據地，係在該地。倘謂羅馬仍能僅利於各種工作之說，實為掩飾眞實之局面而已，因羅馬易受海面之威　，且共交通有被敵軍突然切之斷可能。</p>
<p>羅馬七日中央社電　德駐馬城總司令雷恩約將軍對海通社記稱：羅馬非被德軍佔領，此城仍與德軍無關。羅驪居民除由義警察當局略以限制其活動時間外，其私生活並不受任何之影響。現在羅馬僅有微弱之德軍駐守，羅馬不設防城市之性質仍無變理。駐該城之　軍不過予義警以必須之援且國，使共便於執行職務。義警係在義當局統一指揮下而配備有必要之武器，俾對亂黨或共黨以迅速行動防止之。又羅馬之糧食，因德當局設法獲得特別食糧之供應，故並不感缺乏。記者詢以德軍保衛梵蒂岡之情形，據答稱，在羅馬成戰區而義軍未能保衛聖城之二十四小時，德傘兵即為義軍擔任此項任務，敎皇及瑞士衛隊對此舉深為諒解。梵蒂岡原有營訪之設，傘兵無庸露宿，吾人並傳使用梵蒂岡之醫院以治療傷病者。迄至目前為止，絕無小幸事件發生，殊堪慶幸會。日來羅馬最主要之事件常推格拉齊亞尼元帥之演說，記者會與帥　談甚久，藉諗德議關係友好一如往昔。</p>
<p>德潛水艇在大西洋　使用新式磁性魚雷</p>
<p>葡京七日中央社電　據海通社訉：「華盛頓報」力陳當德潛艇恢復積極活動之全力時，大西洋戰爭將為此次戰爭具有決勝性之最重要一幕。德潛艇之戰略與武器咸有改進，華盛頓會接得可靠之消息，指陳德潛艇具有新式之磁性魚雷，爆炸力極大，遭遇襲擊之船舶無不披靡，大西洋中之反軸心國商船已開始罹蹂　之慘劇矣。</p>
<h3>德撤離計劃完成　固守新陣地　聶伯河下游蘇軍集中</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訉：蘇聯方面申言蘇軍攻勢，因泥濘阻碍而停頓云云，德軍事專家視為完全不確，因泥濘時期尚未降臨，按東綫南部雨量尚少，中部雖大雨數日，亦已停止，蘇軍攻勢之停止，實由於德軍縮短防綫業已竣事。德國軍事發言人於前日申稱，德軍將固守目前之陣地，德軍司令部於縮短防綫時，會考慮科季蘇軍進攻之可能性。德軍撤退時會縝密計劃，不僅携帶重要戰具，並携帶農業給養品，撤退區城之民衆，大部份隨德軍撤退。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德元首行營六日正午發表：泰曼半島北部有局部戰鬥，庫彭橋頭堡登陸蘇軍於熾烈白刃戰後悉被　滅。德軍於　伯河中游粉碎法律軍攻勢，轟炸猛攻已將蘇軍橋頭堡之陣地强行壓　。又普列貝特三角洲兩面仍有激戰。戈美爾南方及斯摩倫斯克西方蘇軍會企圖突破德軍陣地，執拗反坆，但悉歸失敗。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社軍事記者塞托留斯稱：東綫蘇軍攻勢，雖未能謂為業已完全停止，但其進攻力量，顯已有疲　之微象，此以南段為尤甚　　方之攻勢戰略，顯然已不得不放棄實行矣。蘇參謀部欲於泥濘季開始以彰，於戈美爾與斯摩倫斯克明斯克公路以鉗形活動，突破德軍轟伯河防綫之計劃，殆已不復被十分重視。日業該處蘇軍進展已趨連緩，而德軍抵抗則轉　。該處之戰局亦已趨於　定矣。蘇軍於星期二僅在奧爾夏以東戈美爾以北，有較猛烈之進攻，但均已被擊退。東綫中路其餘各處，則僅有局部小戰，聶伯河戰綫蘇軍僅於列貝特河口狹小地帶內從事掙扎，以圖擴展其四岸橋頭堡　之範圍。在其他之橋頭堡壘中，蘇軍似因缺少生力軍而未能從事類似之掙扎，此處之蘇軍為德軍之反攻所迫，已不得不易攻為守矣。蘇軍似不致遽即放棄共突破陣綫之計劃，蘇軍在目前雖無力另　大攻勢之中心，但在聶伯河與亞索夫海間，似尚有力為之。柴普營基與梅立托波爾敵於後方有軍隊集中。當可證實此說，當然蘇軍如果於此處進攻，德軍必不致一無進備。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　國民政府，十月七日，軍委員參　武官司長郝　舉呈請辭職，郝鵬舉准免本職，此令。軍事參議院副院長鄭大章別有任用，鄭大章應免本職，此令。任命鄭大　為軍委會參贊武官公署武官司長，此令。任命富雙英為軍事參議院副院長，此令。任命郭鳳瑞為軍委會參贊武官公署少將參贊武官，此令。任命會　錞兼建　部郵雷司司長，此令。</p>
<p>蒙特巴屯頓　抵新德里</p>

<h3>田島被任　駐滬總領事</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日外務省發表，任命田島　為駐上海總　事。外務售記生惠木春松氏為駐北京副領事。</p>
<h3>日輸一艘　遭潛艇擊沉</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日鐵道省七日下午六時三十分發表：關釜（下關釜山間）×××，於十月五日上午二時許在冲島附近遭敵　水　魚雷攻擊，十餘分鐘筆即沉沒，日海軍機艦及在附近航行之船聞得　號，火速趕　，力　營救，但當時波浪較大，又値深夜，故全體船員及乘客六百一十六人中，僅救起七十二人。</p>
<h3>襲仰光敵機　遭日軍擊退　南太平洋收獲戰果</h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　敵機B24型二十二架來　仰光埠頭附近，日航空部隊及地上砲火即予迎　，創敵機數架，二架冒烟遁走，日機　失一架，又地上所受捐害極輕微。</p>

<h3>三國外長會議　將在蘇揭幕　英宣布文登隨員人選</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訉：德政界人士指陳英，美雖已宣布三國外長即將集議於莫斯科，而蘇聯方面對此事猶力　緘默，殊堪重視。美國通訉社會述及莫斯科所擬在此一會議中提出這最低　求，殊堪玩昧，　言有謂：蘇聯欲將　波蘭及芬闌之一部，以及波羅的海詺國併入蘇版圖，而蘇聯之勢力，並將及於其他「奧蘇友善而並非必須受共產政府治理」之國家，若羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，保加利亞及伊朗等。德政界人士認此等報告乃英美所放之試騐氣球，但尚未得到莫斯科之反響，英國近且發表協約國援助蘇聯之長　事蹟，俾得與蘇聯所將提出之要求　抗。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　倫敦官方昨日宣布：英外相艾登赴莫斯科，麦加反軸心三國會議時，同行者有英國之蘇聞通大人，其中一人即外次史特闌格，史氏於一九三〇年至一九三三年會任英國駐蘇代辦，其餘尚有章　遜及　艾登之私人秘書哈威。前因英，蘇公約事偕艾登前赴莫斯科，作初步磋商之外部常次買德幹僧土，此次將不隨行，此外，又傳艾登之隨員中有戰時內閣之軍事副官伊斯梅將軍，於此可見會議中或將討論軍事性質之問　，又悉，現在倫敦之新任美國駐蘇大使哈里曼，亦將偕高級軍官數人前往赴任。</p>
<p>日內瓦七日中央社電　據墨西哥京城消息：前美國駐蘇大使合維斯，在墨西哥京城與蘇聯駐墨大使島曼斯基會談。據信此乃英·美·蘇外長會議之準備，島曼斯基不僅被認為係斯　林及蘇外長莫洛托夫之親信顧問，且係蘇聯駐西半球外交代表之領袖。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據倫敦消息：新任蘇聯駐英大使顧塞夫，星期六抵達倫敦，昨至外部訪英外相艾登。</p>
<h3>歐戰與巴爾幹諸國（二）</h3>
<p>保加利亞</p>
<p>保加利亞國五鮑理斯三世，於八月二十八日逝世，六歲的幼帝希美恩二世踐祚，而决定以基利爾親王，衛洛甫首相，米旭夫陸相組織攝政府，異贊幼帝。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰後因斐迪南王讓位而鮑理斯王卽位時，左右保加利亞政局者為農民黨首領史泰萊布爾斯基。這農民黨內閣自在一九二三年政變瓦解以來，鮑理斯國王的發言權逐漸强化。深得國王信任的國王副官長基奧賽巴的第一次內閣，自在一九三五年末成立以來，國王似漸振獨裁的權力，戰爭初期的中立政策，自衛洛甫內閣成立後，漸染親德色彩。一九四一年三月二十三日簽字加入日德義三國同盟後，為軸心國之一，這種政策的變遷，均在國王的指導下實施的。</p>
<p>鑒於這種國王之獨裁的地位，國五的急逝，在保加利亞將是相當大的打擊。尤以最近英美通過安果拉及伊斯坦堡對巴爾幹諸國的活動，漸趨熾烈時，今後政局的動向，頗堪注目。保加利亞的外交政策，因一九四一年三月一日加入三國同盟第敵眾我途告決定，同月五日，與英斷絕國交，同時保加利亞的在美資金亦被凍結。唯保加利亞的政策，和其他諸巴爾幹交戰國不同者，為對蘇關係。</p>
<p>原來保加利亞人乃土耳其民族的一族，因係從瓦爾伽地方移居過來的關係，在言語方面，類似斯拉夫族的俄羅斯語，在社會方面，亦有着和俄羅斯親近的感情。此點在俄國革命筆亦繼續着，因此，德蘇戰爭開始後，僅保加利亞堅持中立政策，這點和日本的立塲頗為近似。所以去年日保二國間決定交換公使時，首任公使倍愛甫氏能經由西比利亞赴東京就任。</p>
<p>這種對蘇中立政策，雖和日本所處的塲合相同，但決不減弱保加利亞的對德協力，跟着對英戰爭的進展，在軍事上，涇濟上都積極的援助德國。</p>
<p>構成這保加利亞的對德協力政策的基礎者，乃對德經濟依存及德國援助保加利亞收復失地。茲試碠保加利亞的恢復失地的歷史。</p>
<p>恢復失地一頁歷史</p>
<p>保加利亞在一八九六年國王斐迪南之下，得奧大利的援助，從土耳共獲得獨立，但這獨立直至一九零九年始得列國的承認。嗣參加第一次巴爾幹戰爭，會把壓迫者土耳其逐出歐洲，後因佔領地分配問　起內閧而敗退，所佔領的領土，一旦喪失。更因在世界大戰中敗北的結果，不能不償付巨額的賠款，同時，把保加利亞南部割　於羅馬尼亞，脫拉基亞割　於希臘。</p>
<p>這此失地的收復，乃保加利亞多年來的希望。滿足　希望之一部的，是根據德義的溫那裁定，從羅馬尼亞割　南吐勃　基亞。</p>
<p>翌年三月，因保加利亞參加三國同盟，德軍乃進駐保加利亞。對此，英軍的向希臘登陸，四月，南斯拉夫與英軍的協力，乃德國之巴爾的協力，乃德國之巴爾幹作戰不能避免的結果。當德軍進　南斯拉夫時，保加利亞軍亦會協力進軍馬其頓尼亞，脫拉基阿爾，此後保軍即與德軍一同以數師兵力以擔任南斯拉夫的馬其頓尼亞地方及希臘的脫拉基亞地方一部的警備。</p>
<p>產業與貿易</p>
<p>保加利亞居民的八成從事農業，其耕作面積的七在種植榖物，榖物的收獲額在平年　農有四百萬噸，為巴爾幹有數的穀物　出國。一九四零年收獲額較平年減一成半，一九四一·四二兩年减二成。收獲狀况極不順利，因地方食料不足的原因，一九四一睥收獲後，不再將穀物輸出。本年度的云作據傳頗為良好。</p>
<p>在煤礦業部門，總額一六七萬公斤的產額中，一三六萬公斤是政府煤礦，少數的礦工業大半為國營。</p>
<p>其次說到貿易，輸出品中統要的是烟草，砂糖，織維製品，果物蔬菜等，對德貿易佔大部份，對德貿易額對全體的比率輸入自一九三八年的五二％增至一九四一年的七九％，　出自一九三八年的五八％增至一九四一年的六八％。最近的輸出入額及對德貿易額如下表明示：</p>
<p>保加利亞貿易總數（單位百萬保幣）</p>

<p>評言</p>
<h3>經濟界　標金自由買賣</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊，謂商統會曾以政府收買棉紗布支付之標金，能否允許商人自由買賣，價格有　限制一問題，函請財部核示，茲據財部正式函復該會，謂黃金收歸國有，並未實施，各紗布的領得標金，自可自由買賣，價格亦無靡限制</p>
<p>此訊果確，則不特過去一般人對於政府能否眞實以標金收買棉紗布的疑慮，可以一掃而空，抑且對於黃金亦將限價收歸國有之謠傳，亦可因而消滅，因爲政府　眞要在不久的將來把黃金收歸國有，那又囘　多此一舉，把金條先行付出去收買棉紗布呢？堂堂政令，旣非兒戲，更非陷阱，紗布商對於此點，似可從此放心了。</p>
<p>政府在上濟以標金收買棉紗布一舉，不特在沿海地方，已經獲致抑平物價，安定民生的美滿效果，而且對於內地中國，似亦發生微妙的安定幣値作用，因旬日以前，　據報載，美國已允將一百六十噸資金（約値二億美元）輸往重慶，作爲已往五億美元借欵之一部，以資收縮內地通貨之流通額，而提高其購買力。此訊果確，足微友邦的賢明措施，却已刺激了渝方，爲東施之效顰。</p>
<h3>各業應切實遵守　同業買賣業規　所用度量衡器須合標準</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會所訂定之『同業買資業規」，業經呈准市經濟局，及市糧食局兩主管機關施行，凡屬各該同業公會之會員商號，無論零售或批發，均須一律遵守此項『同業買賣業規』，不得故意違反，除應遵照公會所定限價出售外，同時其所用之寸尺度量衡器，亦應適合標準。茲將其應遵行各點錄誌於後，</p>
<p>業規要點</p>
<p>同業向客戶辦貨，有協訂者業契約者，應依照協訂契約辦理。關於同業間互交之市價，由雙方依據公平原則，自由訂定，前項協定之契約，有整個共同性者，應另行呈報關係當道。　同業對於顧客之市價，由公會按成本高低，公平議決價目，務須一體遵守。　同業售貨價目，悉以對換成票或發票標明者爲憑，清賬時均不得增減，以昭信寔，貨欽以上海通用弊制爲標準，否則照市升扣。　新開設之公司商號，須於一星期內向公會登記，塡寫入會志願書，領取章程業規。　凡巳加入公會者，如遇更動股東，增滅資本，或更易經理，須隨時書面報告。　同業必須用政府規定之度量衡器。　顧客擬預定期貨者，須開立成交單，註明貨品種類。價目。數量。及交貨日期。</p>
<p>十底比期將屆　行莊調劑金融</p>
<p>銀行聯合準備委負會竭力調劑同業行莊金融後，凡會員行莊因業務上正當需要，均得依照新拆借辦法，提供財產向該委員會</p>
<p>申請拆款</p>
<p>惟錢莊須向錢業準備庫轉拆，每一同業拆借以二十萬元爲基數，並以各該同業活期存欺總數十分之二加基數之合計數爲限，其活期存欵超過三千萬元者，其超過部份之拆放額，應依十分之一計算，所以際此十底比期將屆之時，而各行莊均能</p>
<p>應付裕如</p>
<p>銀根依舊並無過分緊急現象，惟各行莊對於工商各業貸欵，決在可能範圍之內予以援助，但不合放欵新限制者，如投機囤積等所需資金，決予完全拒絕，絕對不予通融。又悉滙劃錢莊僧用長期放欵，向以四底及十底爲新貸及淸償之期，此次十底到期之欵雖爲數不多，但各莊對於信用素著之正當商號公司工廠，如有充分之用途，准予繼續</p>
<p>通融貸放</p>
<p>新貸欵必須有殷實之保證人方准的量辦理，關於內盤會議，開錢業公會循例於十月底邊舉行，惟日期尙待理事會議公決之。</p>
<h3>各業公會工作　積極開展中</h3>
<p>本市各主要及次要同業公會，適應戰時體制，暨協助政府完成統制經濟政　起見，均先後遵照主管官署之命令，貿行改級，除通過會章外，並還出首屆理監事，查本市同業公會之整理工作，係自本年四月份起，迄今將　半年，經關係當局及各公會負責人之努力，成績相當美滿，現今本市公會之改相工作可告一段落，主要公會全部改組　事，次要公會亦十之八九整理就緒，在商統會屬下者，計有聯合會二十三個，屬于其他各主要機關之公會共有二百家左右。</p>
<p>積極展開會務</p>
<p>各業公會之組織工作已經完成現正積極展開會務，綜據各公會工作之重點，約有以下數端。　會員經營物資之共同取買保管運輸販賣事項。　會員製造物資所需原料及燃料之北同取得及分配事項，　會員經營物資之生產數量及販賣價格之審議事項，　會員事業資金之調節及債務之担保事項。　會員經營事業之調各統計設計指導及檢查取締事項，　執行主管官署指定或委託之事項。</p>

<h3>仁濟堂　辦理六十餘年　古典的慈善機關（二）</h3>
<p>「善門難開」，遭原只是一些慳吝者的口頭禪而已；但是在今日要辦眞正的慈善事業，確也有這種感覺。</p>
<p>經濟上窘狀</p>
<p>就以上海仁濟善堂來說吧，它是上海歷史最悠久，基礎也稱鞏固的慈善團體，它不僅有一批能幹和忠實的工作人員，而且還有相當的資產，主要的是房，地產的租金，在往日，經常有幾百或上千的收入，總算是頗有可爲了　何况由於辦的成績卓著，信譽久孚，一方面各界捐款源源而來，另一方面如藥行等也放膽任其賒藥，每年逢節一給。因此雖不寬裕，也還不怎麼窘迫，可是由於戰後局面變了，房地產堂的收入，增加有限，至今不過每月一千之數，試問可充什麼費用？可是、這一方面還得扣除水電捐稅保險等費，而其上漲窺且不啻倍蓰！一般營業的支出，又隨物價之高　而增加，不僅有繼續性的如恤嫠恤貧　診事業不忍停　。即如施藥也以藥價　漲而使該堂的帳而出現，大的「赤字」。以本年度預算而言，收入約計十八萬六千六百二十四元五角二分，支出約計三十二萬三千四百十二元八角三分，不是漆十三萬六千七百八十八元三角一分？然　是以上年年終幣值計算的，現在收入固然不會增加，實際尙慮不足，可是支出却以物價高漲而非超出預算數倍不可，則赤字數目自然更可驚人了。這種不足之數，只有依靠各界善士的援助，以資補救。可是實際上也許因為社會的不景氣吧，據說近來仁濟善堂所收捐款太稀少了。</p>
<p>本年春曾聲請上海市貧病救濟協會補助，由該會兪詠華委員前往調查，認爲亟須補助，後經審定，對於施藥部份，每月補助一萬元，以六個月爲度，共六萬元（育嬰部份補助之數詳見下文）使該堂施藥事業得以恢復。不過實際上不足之數尙大。亟待各界善士予以更大的捐助。當然，仁濟善堂的事業是多方面的，除了現欵之外，如中西藥品等也極盼捐助。不久秋暮冬來，施衣恤貧工作又要緊張起來了，什麼舊衣之類，他們也是樂於代收代發的。</p>
<p>跑馬廳路一百五十七號，　與國際大飯店隔跑馬塲　相　時，雖然這裏只是一排竹籬笆，和幾所中式古樓，可是，印在發射出人類　營互助的光芒呢！竹籬笆上有直徑一公尺的大字「仁濟育嬰堂」——正　上海仁濟育堂另一營業，專司撫育遺嬰的地方。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂</p>
<p>推進大門，就聽到乳嬰的啼聲，啊！原來一個個小房間裏，盡是出世不久的小娃娃呢！主任高子文先生領到每一間去參觀。第一部份是人工營養部，占有兩間，整齊地排列着二十二只小鐵床，每一只床上活躍着可愛的娃娃，昨天或幾個月以前才出世就被丢棄的可憐兒，總算得了救了，看！講士們那樣細心地撫育着。護士長卜文玉女士說。人工營養部除她以外尙有護士八位，分爲三班，每班工作八小時，不分晝夜，輸流看護，喂奶沐浴，都依一定的時問，每天還規定測量體重及體溫各一次，分別紀載，以供醫生查考。嬰兒食物，以奶粉奶糕爲主，幸虧振農牛奶公司每天捐助不少牛奶，所以營養還算勉强足夠。</p>
<p>東首一連三個房間，都屬天然營養部，排列着四、五十隻籐製的小吊床，嬰孩們的面色紅潤、且很活發，據說現在共有奶媽十八名，負責撫育天然營養部的嬰孩，每人認定兩名或三名。全部約可容納嬰孩五十餘名，如遇嬰孩過多時則搭食奶粉及奶糕等代乳品，以補人奶的不足。有一位女管理員，主持奶媽之考勤及進退　事。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂，收官的棄嬰中，最大部份是惠　已到不易救治的時候，才被貧苦的父母坳棄的，所以往往不及救治便已死亡。但是高主任說，只要一息尙存，她們對於棄兒們的病。總是盡力診療的，對於入堂後的嬰兒健康，尤爲注意，當收進嬰兒時立即加以檢騐診斷，將體格强弱分別塡入收嬰簿。平日聘請中四醫生到堂診治病嬰，推拿醫生沈哲參女士　每天有大半天在堂工作，當記者去參觀時，她還正在忙着替一位嬰孩診治熱痛呢。</p>
<p>目前上海一八兩區（舊公井及法租界）。正式收養棄嬰的，似乎只有這座仁濟育嬰堂，因此，無形中變成上海棄嬰的「集中營」了。可是，這「集中營」　在巳有幾十年的歷史。遠在民國紀元前二十四年即光緒十四年正月，仁濟善堂就在當內餘　舉辦「留嬰局」，專　收養棄嬰及無力撫養者。並已特殊備用奶媽，喂奶撫育，以全上蒼好生之德。不過一向因爲地位經費等等限制，一切因陋就簡，未能多事收養。後來因爲辦理認眞，僧　卓著，社會上同情贊助者日多，經費漸形充足，於是規模稍畧，收養數額也就與日俱增。並正式定名爲「仁濟育嬰堂」，至民國九年由各堂董事及十紳　集款項，在跑馬廳路自購房屋，收容撫育棄兒的事業才算踏上正軌。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂收養的嬰兒，是允許一般缺乏子女者前往領養的，但須經由一定的手續，首先塡具領嬰申請書，經該堂審查後，發給空白保證書，由領養人及保證人填具送堂，然後由該堂派員調查，如認為確屬身家淸白，職業正當，而能擔負所領嬰孩一切費用者，經該堂通如准其領養後，方得前往抱領。該堂還得監視領養者對所領嬰孩，完全與親生子女同樣待遇。他們對於領出小孩，隨時派員前往調查，如果認爲不滿，就得分別輕重，或予警告。或將該孩領回。不過，據該實際上領出嬰孩的遭遇，大體上還算好。可以驚奇的是，雖在此艱苦的時代，前往領取嬰孩的還不少，據統計，自本年一月至八月，共收嬰孩六百七十八名，其中留養及病殘者佔百分之四十六，領出者竟　百分之五十四。否則，領養者少，育嬰堂安得廣廈千萬間。</p>
<p>雖然如此，由於一般社會經濟狀况的困難，無力養育子女而忍痛拋棄的人數，確在日漸增加；相反的，眞正有力收領的却並不多。更可注意的是棄兒中有大部份是病嬰，所以嬰兒收進後的死亡率很高。無論從人情言，從社會國家前途言，對於這種現象，是有心人所不能漠視的。必須大量的收容棄嬰，必須充實嬰兒醫藥設備以期减少嬰兒的死亡率，最好當然能如徐家匯　母院育嬰堂和南市新普育堂嬰育堂那樣，由育嬰而撫育到進幼稚院，進小學乃至成人長大，爲社會國家培育有用的人材。可是，這種理想之實現，首先就得經費。而現在一八兩區內唯一大規模育嬰機關的仁濟育嬰堂的經費，就在異常困難之中。雖然事務費已减到最低限度，職員男女工人，女管理員二人，看護長一人，駐堂醫生一人，看護八人，奶媽十八人，待遇都很淸苦，除大部份津貼米費三百六十元之外，薪水在一百元以上的只有四五八，奶媽也不過五十三元一月，但是儘管節約，仍有捉襟見肘之憾。年首曾聲　上海市貧病救濟協會補助。經委員調查、認為確有迅速加以補助的必要，後自二月份起，對育嬰部份，每月補助三千六百元，以六個月爲度。使該堂稍感寬鬆。目前困難。　是嬰孩衣破奶媽被褥無力購置。　是奶媽以待遇過於菲薄，不及私家傭工遠甚，不易雇到，而最主要的困難是一般捐款的寥落，爲着交持一八兩區唯一收養棄嬰的事業。我們期待社會上熱心人士踴躍捐助。（完）</p>

<p>糧食問題意見</p>
<h3>改進糧食問題議</h3>
<p>— 史瑜</p>
<p>（庚）利用農業（械如共使農業機械化，既然可以增加生產，又可以减少費用。美國農民僅佔全世界從事農業者的百分之四，但是能夠生產　世界百分之七十的玉蜀黍，百分之六十的　花，百分之二十的小麥，還有其他不少農產物。就是農業機械，能夠　應用的緣故。蘇　在一九三六年，應用於農業生產的耕種　有八萬匹千架，牽引　十九萬三千架，尙有不少其他的機械、預　農業總產量可以增加百分之二三，六，我國雖然不能如美國的利用大量機械耕種，可是華北四北各省區，至少當能如蘇聯的利用耕種機、牽引機和其他的新式機械，來從　耕作。至於灌溉，排水打穀等一類的工作，更可以普遍的經用電力機械來代替人力和　力，據江蘇蘇州的報告，利用電力　灌溉，較之人力　水，可以省費之二。由此可見農業機械化對於促進農業生產的重要了！　見中國糧食問題再檢討一九四頁）</p>
<p>（辛）活　農榮金融</p>
<p>我國大多數的農氏，旣然智　低下，而且經濟拮据，每年的收入，尙不能維持最低下的生活，孟子所謂「樂歲終生苦，凶年不免於死亡」眞是他們的寫照。所以要使他們改進農產，不但限於智力，而且困於經濟。必定要由政府推動，方才可以按步就班，循序而進。就當前的情形來說，要想改進農產，第一脫離不了資本，無論改良種子，改良灌漑和排水，防除病蟲的災害，改良施肥，和利用農業機械，都非錢不行，惟有期待政府籌措大宗款項，舉辦農貸，利　來得低些，期限來得長些，方纔可以活潑農村的金融，增進農業的生產。最好由政府來組織農村貸金合作社，值得農民合作互助，不受中間人的剝創，如必需品的購買合作，新式農具或牲畜的利用合作，灌漑排水的合作等等，總希望費用减輕，生產增加而農民的生活，也可以改善了，至於農產運銷，亦可利用此合作社，以與政府的收購于續相銜接，不但事功　　，而且農民，政府，消費者，都可受其利益，實在是一舉而數善具。</p>
<p>㈡收購統制　糧食增產以後，第二步就得討論到妝購事宜，因爲調節軍需，供應民食，非由政府統制收購，不易收最大的效力，筆者所見到的，有下列三點：</p>
<p>（甲）收購的機構問題　務應統一辦理，　　可以放手做去，旣然可以免去攘奪的劣點，又可以避免責任的諉卸，依照以前的情形而論，本來由糧食部經辦可是根據最近的法令來解釋，巳移交糧統會辦理了。</p>
<p>（乙）收購的地域和數量問題　這一個問題就比較的複雜，而技術化了。因爲對於各該地域的人口和產量，如其沒有精密的統計，常常足以憤事的，　現在可舉例說，如某縣平均每年產米三百萬石，有人口四十萬，每人每年的消費量爲二石米那就每年可以輸米出口的共有一百二十萬石，換言之，政府的收購數量，不得超過這個數量，也不得少於這個數量，因爲如其超過了，當地的民食，就要發生恐慌，如其收購不到這個數量，常地的民食，就要過剩，過和不及均要引起恐慌，細察當前收購米糧的情况，似乎並未能注意到這點，所以弄得米價飛漲，政府人民，交受其害了，這點尙望當局注意改良，力加調整，先要有一個　個收　計劃才好！</p>
<p>（丙）收購的價格和時間問題　這兩個問題，亦有相當的聯繫，收購米穀糧的適當時間　應當在　穀登塲以後，到　歷年關，何應當截止，方才可以大量的收購，以便　年的　用，非有萬不得已的事故，時間切勿延長。　於在　　　接的時候收買，數　可　有限，而民心一定恐慌，所謂輿　爭食，是要不得的，至於收買米糧的價格，在新榖登　以後，因作　　，價格可以便宜，但是爲顧全農民的生活計，所定的價格，應當使農民覺得滿意，而消費者的利益，亦可以　　，再則中間人的機構，最好能夠儘量避免，如其經由農村合作社居間，實在可說是最合理想的。</p>
<p>㈢存　統制　穀類的生長，多具有季節性，所以牠的收獲期，雖然因為氣候寒暖的不同，而有差參可是總在四個月之內，至於一般人民糧食的需要，那是終年一律的，而且每月的比　，亦沒有多大變化。考察我國一般情形，稻米在陰歷八九月間收　，大部在十，十一，十二，三個月中銷售：（係指陰歷時間，以下同）小麥在五月登塲，大部在六，七，八，三個月中銷售，由於收穫季節的供過於求，和　黃不接之際的糧食感到缺乏，所以非有存儲米糧食　制度、就不足以調劑盈虛，平準價格，我國對於倉庫制度，早有發明，而最著名的，爲戰國時李　的常平倉，隋時長孫平的義倉，南宋時朱　的社倉。在今日而談存　統制，不過恢復已往的辦法，而且政府早經實行了，　者爲求完備計，尙有數點意目列下：</p>
<p>（甲）倉庫的建設和地點　倉庫的建設規模務須宏大，而且對於防火，防災，通風等設備，更應力求完善，庶幾存儲米糧旣然來得安全，而且時間亦可比較長久。至於設立倉庫的地點，當然以交通便利，人民　　的大都會爲適合理想，因爲米糧的收集，旣然容易，而且米糧的分發，也感到便利。我國今日在儲米糧的倉庫，巳決定由政府辦理，似乎應該有一個整個計劃，即預備每年米糧最多時候，應該存儲的數量，然後再選擇適中地點，分別建立倉庫，構成米糧倉庫　，然後一切可以按序就班，分類辦理了，但是以今日政府的資力論，短時內恐怕不易實行，但是此乃百年大計，爲調節盈虛，供應民食計，希望政府早日舉辦，不要因簡就陋才好。</p>
<p>（乙）倉庫的管理和米糧的保管　上述的兩項，都是主持倉庫員司的任務，可演是二而一的問題所以合併討論。管理倉庫，雖不是十分　　的事情，但是責任非常重大，進出極有關係，本來經營倉庫，須有專門的學識，在我國人才缺乏的狀況下，本難求全責備，但是權衡人材應當以背負責任而且幹練的　訂來負全責。因為米糧是民食所需關係十分重大，管理的人員，不但應當十分謹慎，而且應當　法保管得非常妥善。　們知到的，米麥存儲一久，斗升就不免虧折，如何方才能　傳得虧折的數　，減　最低　度；倉庫之中，常有蟲鼠之類　　米穀，在倉庫設備不完整的情况下，如何　蟲鼠的　　，可以減至最低　度，如何使米糧的存儲，可以通風乾燥，藉以避免米質的因潮變紅，不能供食；如何使米糧依照品級和種類排列，一日接到通知，可以按圖　　　立刻分發，旣然不致發生錯誤，而且絲毫不會延誤。以上數項，看來很是容易。實則能夠完全做到的，並不多見，而作奸犯科，營私舞弊的，倒是時有所聞。所以人事問題，很關重要的。據九月五日申報所載，蘇浙皖三省糧倉，糧食部巳限期完成，視事務的繁簡，分爲一二三等而且規定原則和辦法，以後對於糧食的存儲，當然可臻妥貼了。</p>
<p>㈣運輸統制　凡是收買米糧，運入倉庫，和按月以規定的數量，配給各地，如其沒有運輸機構，那就經濟學上的地域效用和時間效用，就無從產生了。我國平時國內糧食的運銷，常是費用貴而時間長，所以招致洋米的輸入，而增加農村的危機。目前由於戰爭關係，洋米　從輸入，而國內一切交通機關，又因軍運紛繁餘力有限，所以要求米糧運輸的敏捷，而收到良好的效果，非成立一個切實負責的米糧運銷統制機構不可，筆者覺得下列數點，尙有注意的價値：</p>
<p>（甲）統制運　　　的確立　要使糧食流通圓滑，達到調整供需目的起見，非成立一個統制運節的機構不可。就上海而　，以前的米糧聯營社，並未能完成運銷敏活的任務，而有加以改進的必要。希望此後米糧運節的機構　能夠網羅航運陸運的人材，庶幾　理米糧的運輸，可以迅赴事功，而　人民　於米糧的配給，不致如大旱之望雲霓，而能得到充分的數量，方才可以說是　到任務，至於人　的調整，和運輸時折耗的减輕，由於海上名流的主持，自能任賢使能，指揮若定，而使昔日的汚點，一掃而空的。</p>
<p>（乙）運節交通網的構成　由於常前運　工且的缺乏，糧食的運聯，深深的感到痛苦，所以有先行構成運輸交通綱寬　運　工具，以防意外發生時仍可　來　的　　。先　陸上運輸，公路上汽車　運，不易辦到，由鐵道運輸，一方　應先　軍運，同時對於米糧運輸，　　　　爲交涉，務　可以儘量利用，不稍稽延爲主。此外對於統運、　　深加注意，再　可利用的輪船，雖然不　充分，但是應當採用拖船制，或者木船制。以補火車之不足，　則時間比較的延長，可是可以大量運輸，來　如能　沛，那就民心可以安定　價格也不致於上　，所以運輸　構的敏捷與否。對於　食的　　，是有十二分重大關係的。</p>
<p>㈤配給統制　就上海的情形說，米糧已經　　統制，而且實行米和麺粉的票券制度，計口投糧了，但是就全國的情形說。仍是各自為政，如其希望糧食統制，能夠發揮最大效力，那就全面配給制度，殊有考慮推　的必要。就政府的統制力量，和各地人民的習慣說，要實施全面配給，尙有不少難關，須待設　打開。第一步不妨先就各大都市推行，而後再及其他縣邑，和窮鄉僻瓖，爲的要使得名人的消費數量，合乎標準，國家和人民的關係，更來得密切起見，全面　給制度，可說勢在必行，筆者認爲有値得注意的幾點，把牠寫在下面：</p>
<p>（甲）配給的　量問題　糧食而談到配給，本巳含有不足的意義在內，所以大都在戰時方才實施，這點人民固應體諒政府的苦衷；可是人民最低限度的生活，應該加以維　，那是天經地義，國家務須設法的。戰時各國糧食配給的數量，雖然並不一律，但須能夠維持個人的　康，各國皆然。就今日上海米糧配給的數量說，以前情形還好些，近來不是日期延誤。就是數量减少。最近一期，只有食米一升，麺粉兩斤，要使人民維持十天，如何能行；有錢的向黑市搜購，無錢的祇好枵腹，對於上　五百萬市民，可說是一個極嚴重的威脅，米糧聯營社的經辦不善，放棄責任，有如九月三日申報社評所說的確是使人痛心，而覺得國人的組織，反不如日方的中文米榖配給　合，肯負責任能有辦法，總之配給數量，能夠充分，那就一切解決，否則不平之鳴，恐怕尙有過於此者，所以在筆者的意見，每人每十天的配給數量，至少應該有米五升，麵粉兩斤，方才可以不致饑饉，方才可以努力奉公，而黑市也不消滅而自消減了。</p>
<p>（乙）　配給的價格問題　配給的價格，就一般情形講，固然要比較收購價格爲昻貴，可是因爲政府統制的關係，牠昻貴的程度，也很合理化的，　然　於環境的變遷，收歸米糧的價格，亦隨之　　，而配給的價格，亦有上　的趨向，但較之黑市，可相　得遠了。總之從消費者的立塲言，米糧既然是每天所必需的，自然　可能的希望價格的减低，相希望數量的是夠。可　是　樣殷切的！</p>
<p>（丙）　給的調整問題　由於米　的數量，　然政府力求增產，但是　收的　歉　並非人力所　完全左右的，尤其戰中時期，人力常感不足，因而影響歲收。也是實情，　以在　可設法之中，不得不另謀調整的方法，以求民食的充沛　從消極方面說，如禁止釀酒，製　　等，以節約米麥的消費：從積一方面說，用雜糧玉屬　，番薯等拌食，以補食糧的不足，不得已的時候，且有廢止朝食，以節約物力的，此等方法，列強均　實行，我國也不妨</p>
<p>要之在統制糧食的步驟下，最要的是增加生產和公平配給，兩者，而收購，存儲和運銷等之步驟，不過是從生產　到配給中間的必要手段，雖說重要性較次，可是一有破綻，立即牽動全局，人們　當同樣重視，一毫放鬆不得，方才可以收到美滿的效果，再則有一點，　者　在此附帶說時的，　是收購糧食，應當以現鈔爲原則，而不搭用糧食庫券。誠然以現鈔收買有膨脹通貨的嫌疑，可是　　的農民，可以得到實惠如其搭用糧食庫券，由於智識程度低下，不知如何行使，一定要影響他們的生活，以後糧食的來源，就要受到嚴重的阻礙了。所以拿現鈔收購爲上策；至於大地主，倉庫　比，阡陌縦橫，收入旣然很豐，自可搭用糧食庫券。所以在徵收糧食時，應有祥細計劃，調查農民的貧富，規定一戶有田若干頃，或者一次可向之徵得糧食若干石以上的，方才可以搭　庫券。</p>
<h3>統制糧食的機構</h3>
<p>要　統制糧食的事務，辦理得頭頭是道，十分完善，非把統制糧食的　構，先行强化起來不可，而强化糧食　構的對策，又非從調整機構，整頓人事和嚴行監督三者，同　　實　行不可。</p>
<p>總之談到戰時糧食問題，非從統制入手不可；而要統制得力，又非使統制的機構，人事和監察三者，能發生聯　的作用不可。所謂「服者懷德，二者畏刑」內在的弊端，百可一掃而空：至於外在的弊端，除捐稅應當由政府設法　免，土匪應當由政府設法肅淸外，其餘的也不成問題，一切統制糧食的程序，可以按照步驟做去，那時糧食機構，尙有不健全的嗎？糧食統制，尙有不成功的嗎？（完）（本文原定載國慶特刊，茲特提前發表於此。編者附識）</p>

<h3>The Way Out for Politics</h3>
<p>When we discuss strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation and promoting comprehensive peace, we strongly advocate taking the realization of political integrity within the peace zone as a prerequisite. We have always maintained that only with political integrity can the thorough implementation of all national policies be guaranteed, preventing them from falling through. However, how can we truly achieve political integrity? This seems to be a question that those in power today should humbly research, widely gather public opinion, and seek a swift resolution.</p>
<p>When discussing the merits and demerits of politics, most people tend to focus only on the opinions and movements of the government authorities, or only on the opinions and movements of the powerful factions of the moment. That is, they only value temporary, superficial phenomena while neglecting the historical driving force of national politics and the trends in popular sentiment to which the nation's political power is tied. This can be said to be a point that those discussing politics today should seriously reflect upon. When we study Chinese and foreign history, we judge the merits and demerits of politics in a certain era based on the trends in popular sentiment of that era. The success or failure of a ruler's policies, as well as the duration of their political life, are not determined by political maneuvering or even strong armor and sharp weapons, nor are they determined by the movements of established political forces. Instead, they must be determined by the support or opposition of the broad masses of the people. The Shang Dynasty, despite its strength, was overthrown by King Zhou, who raised an army from a territory of eighty *li*. The Qin Dynasty, despite its overwhelming power, could not avoid defeat at the hands of Chen Sheng, who rose from the fields, and Liu Bang, a petty official from Sishang. The main reason for this was that the former only possessed authority and did not know how to grasp the people's sentiment, while the latter was able to recognize the people's power, the latent force that determines national politics, and thus achieved success. In our country's history, there are countless examples of those who knew the importance of grasping the people's hearts but failed in their attempts. For example, Wang Mang of the late Western Han Dynasty was a great Chinese statesman who was able to recognize the trends of the times and implement reforms. It can be said that he had already recognized the people's sentiment as a latent political force. However, he ultimately failed because his own political goal of usurpation was flawed and he was abandoned by the people. Later, Wang Anshi's reforms during the Song Dynasty were also a political movement aimed at grasping the people's sentiment. His political goals were also more loyal than Wang Mang's. Unfortunately, because he failed to widely and generously absorb truly talented individuals, he was ultimately submerged by the opposition. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty when Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao advocated reform and modernization, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolutionary movement, that people began to understand and grasp the psychology of the masses.</p>
<p>Due to the evolution of the times, the way out for modern politics not only inherits historical laws and must grasp the centripetal force of the broad masses of the people, but also must pay attention to grasping the psychology of the youth. A government must possess the ability to grasp the psychology of the general public and the youth in order for politics to find a way out and get on track. However, in reality, the thinking of young people is relatively advanced. They often stand at the forefront of the times, and even surpass the times. Therefore, satisfying the political demands of young people is not an easy task, and we will put that aside for now. However, since it is absolutely necessary for the current politics to get on track, then its way out must first focus on how to win and grasp the people's hearts.</p>
<p>So, how do we win and grasp the people's hearts? The most urgent thing is to give the people "peaceful residence and joyful work." Some may question that the world is currently at war, and to talk about peaceful residence and joyful work seems like wishful thinking, because in wartime, the government must ask the people to endure hardship and sacrifice? And the people's responsibility to the country is also to endure hardship and sacrifice. Of course, this is undeniable. However, what we mean by peaceful residence and joyful work is definitely not the same as so-called enjoyment. It is simply a request for politics to get on track, for society to be stable, and for the people to be able to live in peace in their respective professions and do their best. More specifically, it is a request for political integrity, the elimination of corruption; if we are to endure hardship and sacrifice, then everyone should endure hardship and sacrifice together, and there must be no exceptions, and even more, it is absolutely forbidden to use wartime to create opportunities for a few people to get promoted and become wealthy. As the ancients said, "We are not concerned about scarcity, but about inequality." As long as the phenomenon of inequality is eliminated, then society can be stable and the people can live in peace. As for joyful work, it is not only not about enjoyment, but also about giving the people the opportunity to dedicate themselves to working for the country. However, is it possible to satisfy this requirement now? When it comes to industry, how much has been done to facilitate the financing of capital, the allocation of raw materials, the support of technology, the supply of power, and the convenience of transportation, all of which would make industrialists enjoy their work? When it comes to agriculture, how much has been done to improve land laws, reduce the burden of heavy taxes, repair irrigation and water conservancy, provide loans and agricultural tools and fertilizers, and stabilize the prices of agricultural products, especially food, all of which would make farmers enjoy their work? In addition, how much has been done to maintain legitimate commerce, improve the lives of public educators, and promote social undertakings, all of which would allow people to do their best and enjoy their work? The concrete content of peaceful residence and joyful work that the Chinese people are asking for is nothing more than this. We firmly believe that this request cannot be considered excessive or wishful thinking, nor is it the same as enjoyment. Taking our friendly nation Japan as an example, if it did not have the conditions for peaceful residence and joyful work, how could it have enabled the people to unanimously support its government and national policies, and achieve a favorable situation in the war? If we do not first strive to achieve this step of enabling the people to live in peace and enjoy their work, then not to mention how to build the country in the future, even the urgently required strengthening of Sino-Japanese cooperation to win the Greater East Asia War will inevitably become empty talk!</p>
<p>Today, to talk about strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, winning the Greater East Asia War, and promoting the comprehensive peace, unity, and construction of a new China, the first step must be to enable the people to live in peace and enjoy their work. This is the way out for politics, and it will enable politics to get on track, and all national policies can thereby be implemented. The most important thing is to clarify official governance and eliminate all false, corrupt, and old ways. In the past, when Confucius served as acting prime minister as the Grand Minister of Justice, he executed Shaozheng Mao to uphold righteousness, clarify right and wrong, rectify people's hearts, warn against treachery, and encourage loyalty. Even though Shaozheng Mao's power shook the world and he was highly sought after, Confucius did not care. The State of Lu eventually achieved good governance. How is the past different from the present, and how is the present different from the past? May I ask, are there such virtuous, capable, and courageous statesmen today?</p>

<h3>Philippines to Declare Independence; Laurel to Serve as President; Full Text of Draft Constitution Officially Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - Jose Laurel, chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, announced at 11:00 AM on the 7th that the necessary preparations for Philippine independence have been completed. It is hereby declared that independence will be proclaimed on October 14, 1943. On this occasion, I sincerely hope that all Filipino people will be aware and await with enthusiasm the glorious day when the sacred aspirations of many years will be realized. October 7, 1943, Jose Laurel, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, Manila. It is reported that the long-cherished desire for independence of the 18 million people of the Philippines is now within reach. The "Philippine Republic" will also appear in the world as one of the righteous nations of East Asia.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Philippines has broken away from the shackles of the United States and devoted itself to building a new order in East Asia. Now, it will declare independence on October 14th, with Dr. Jose Laurel taking office as the first president. The new Philippines, as elucidated by the Philippine Constitution, is a republican entity based on peace, freedom, and righteousness, dedicated to creating a new world order. Under the leadership of the first president, it will march towards the path of completing the reborn Philippines and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The independence of the Philippines, with the support of Japan, will be realized concretely, earlier than the verbal agreement of three years promised by the United States in the past. This is a sincere manifestation of the spirit of Japanese righteousness. The 18 million people of the Philippines are all looking forward to the arrival of the glorious day, and the whole country is rejoicing and renewing its determination.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - The new Philippines is a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and bears the important mission of building a new order in East Asia and the world. The Philippine Republic Constitution, which was released this time, is its fundamental law. It was drafted by Jose Laurel, Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee. Since June of this year, it has gathered the general will of the Filipino people and undergone multiple careful reviews. The draft constitution was finally completed on September 3rd. On the 4th, it was unanimously approved at the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee meeting. Therefore, a national congress of representatives was convened on the 6th and 7th to complete the procedures for approving the draft constitution. The draft constitution of the Philippines was officially released on the 7th. The basic spirit of the Philippine Republic Constitution has been elucidated in the full text (a total of twelve articles and eighty-eight items). It stipulates that the reborn Philippines is a republic, and the country's name is the Philippine Republic. It clearly states that the Philippine government is determined to contribute to the creation of a world order based on freedom, peace, and righteousness. Different from the old constitution, it takes the construction of a righteous world order as its highest ideal and becomes a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It has two characteristics: 1. Emphasis is placed on the administrative aspect, with the president being politically responsible. The principle of separation of powers is adopted. Therefore, the legislature adopts a unicameral system. The arrangement of the constitutional articles also follows the order of the central law of administrative legislation and development, and it highly values the obligations of the people. Therefore, it can realize the simplification and strengthening of the political power structure. 2. Regarding the development of natural resources and the current situation, it is stated that a comprehensive revision should be made after the Greater East Asia War. For this reason, under the general will of the 18 million Filipino people, the eagerness to liberate the Philippines has been fully expressed. The Philippine Republic Constitution is based on the noble spirit of contributing to the construction of a new order in East Asia, and it is completed to further clarify the great cause of the Philippines in building a righteous nation to the world.</p>
<h3>Recent Battle Results of Japanese Army Air Force: Bombings of Guilin, Shaoguan, and Jian'ou</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported on the 7th that the elite Japanese air force attacked Jian'ou on October 2nd, and then made rapid attacks on Guilin on the 4th and 5th. In addition, another unit attacked Shaoguan, the location of the Seventh War Zone Command of Chongqing, on the 4th, bombing military facilities on various airfields and taxiways. The recent attacks by the Japanese army air force are recorded as follows: 1. On October 2nd, bomber squadrons carried out two consecutive air raids on Jian'ou, destroying the airfield's taxiways. 2. On October 4th, a combined formation of powerful fighters and bombers bravely attacked Guilin. At 10:42 AM, they entered the airspace above the two airfields and bombed the auxiliary equipment, housing, accumulated military supplies, warehouses, etc. on the south side of the airfields, inflicting great damage. On the way back, an enemy "P35" type aircraft pursued a part of the fighter squadron, and two "P40" type aircraft pursued the bomber squadron. The Japanese aircraft immediately counterattacked, and the enemy aircraft immediately fled. Another powerful bombing squadron attacked Shaoguan at 10:25 AM on the afternoon of the 4th, bombing military facilities in the city and destroying twelve freight cars parked at the station. On October 5th, a powerful Japanese fighter squadron attacked the two airfields in Guilin again at 11:00 AM, searching for enemy aircraft. However, the main force of the Japanese aircraft did not encounter any enemy aircraft. Another unit discovered several enemy "P40" type aircraft fleeing, so a small number of aircraft attacked them, shooting down one of them. One Japanese aircraft was lost in the attack that day.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported on the 7th that when the Japanese army air force attacked Guilin on the 4th and 5th, the enemy aircraft had gone into hiding due to the recent aggressive and courageous attacks by the Japanese aircraft. They only feigned pursuit when the Japanese aircraft returned, so the Japanese bomber squadron, under the protection of fighters, did not encounter any resistance. They dropped heavy bombs on the warehouses and other military facilities, achieving the expected results. The commander of a certain unit, who led the first bombing on the 4th, said after returning to base that after our aircraft reached the target area, the bomber squadron immediately bravely bombed the military supply warehouse complex and other military facilities. The enemy seemed to want to preserve its strength and retreated hastily, so the fighter squadron did not achieve the results of shooting down enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the Japanese air force carried out two consecutive air raids on Jian'ou on the 2nd, and then carried out large-scale air raids on Shaoguan and Kaifeng on the 4th, causing considerable damage. It is also said that the Japanese army will continue to attack in the future.</p>
<p>Air Raid on Zunyi</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain place on the 7th stated that the Japanese army air force carried out a joint large-scale air raid with fighters and bombers on Zunyi, a forward base of the US Air Force in southwestern Sichuan Province, on the 6th. At 8:55 AM that morning, when they were heavily bombing the hangars of the airfield there, they suddenly discovered more than ten enemy "P40" type aircraft coming to intercept them, and immediately attacked them. After a fierce air battle lasting two straight minutes, two of the enemy aircraft were hit and emitted white smoke, and were likely shot down, but this has not been confirmed. Two Japanese aircraft were also lost in the battle.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Holds Food Conference</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Guangdong Provincial Government convened a provincial food production promotion conference on the 5th, chaired by Governor Chen, who instructed on the central points of the conference. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, with Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, personally providing guidance. Mayor Wang of Guangzhou, the Mayor of Shantou, the Magistrate of Nanhai County, and others respectively reported on the food situation in their respective areas.

How to promote the warehousing system and regulate the people's food supply in various counties. 3. [Missing]</p>
<h3>Meaning of the Flag of the Emerging Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency) - The national flag of the emerging nation, the Philippine Republic, which is about to be established, has now been decided. The new national flag is based on the flag of independence raised by General Aguinaldo in Cavite in 1898. Near the flagpole is a white equilateral triangle, and the remaining part is divided into blue and red in the upper and lower parts. The triangle is decorated with the sun and three five-pointed stars. White symbolizes purity of thought and righteousness, red symbolizes courage and determination, and blue symbolizes hope and lofty ideals. The sun and stars symbolize the permanent glory and destiny of an independent Philippines. The sun's rays symbolize the eight provinces of Luzon that rose up in response to the Bonifacio Revolution in 1896. The stars symbolize the three regions of Luzon, Mindanao, and the Visayas. The sides of the triangle symbolize the equal rights of the three regions. The embodiment of this flag, which represents the ideals, traditions, history, and glory of the Filipino nation, is the long-cherished wish of the Filipino people. Therefore, the Independence Preparatory Committee specifically uses this flag to represent the Philippine Republic. This flag, created by General Aguinaldo, was once legally prohibited from being used during the American rule of the Philippines. It was not until 1919 that it was allowed to be used, until before the war, but only as a flag subordinate to the American flag. Now, it has completely become the national flag that truly represents the Filipino people.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Punishing Crimes Committed by Public Officials to Be Promulgated; Central Political Committee Resolves to Enact Immediately</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The integrity of a nation's politics depends on whether public officials are honest. Therefore, whether public officials are corrupt or not is related to the politics of a nation. After the National Government returned to the capital, it emphasized clean government. In addition, during the war, whether public officials are honest is even more relevant to the wartime system. Therefore, regarding corruption cases involving public officials, the Central Political Committee passed a resolution on the 7th to enact regulations on punishing crimes committed by public officials. From this, it can be seen how much the government values corruption cases involving public officials. These regulations have already been submitted to the Legislative and Judicial Committee, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Justice to be jointly formulated. They can be promulgated in two weeks, and after promulgation, they can be implemented. It is expected that politics will become more transparent in the future and more suitable for the wartime system.</p>

<h3>Construction of Canals in North China to Be Implemented in Stages</h3>
<p>Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the North China Canal Construction Committee enthusiastically launched the new construction work after the first promotion, it has closely planned and urgently sought to promote the management and security of canals throughout North China and the revitalization of farmland water conservancy. In order to promote the implementation of construction as soon as possible, with a view to enriching the country and the people and completing the industrial base of North China, the Committee followed the First Implementation Outline for Promoting New Construction promulgated by the Political Affairs Committee and formulated an implementation plan to be carried out in three phases in sequence.</p>
<h3>German Troops Continue to Occupy Two Islands in the Aegean Sea; Tensions Rise in Eastern Italy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from Ankara, German troops have occupied the island of Lesros in the Aegean Sea and have also landed on the island of Samos, engaging in battle with British troops and the Baterio army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to the military correspondent Setorius of the Huitong News Agency, the southern Italian front is unstable, and the war is gradually becoming more tense. It is evident that Montgomery has moved his main force to the right flank of the Adriatic coast to support the British troops who landed in Chinmuli. The number of German troops has also increased by an average number of weeks, but it is currently impossible to determine whether the deployment of the main German forces is to change the war from a delaying tactic to an active defense. The timing and location of General Kesselring's deployment of the main force to engage in battle still require careful consideration by several parties. As for the left flank of the British Eighth Army, it is still confined to the mountains north of the Benevento-Foggia railway with minimal progress, not yet crossing San Bartolomeo, southwest of which is the right flank of the American army, whose vanguard has only reached halfway between Benevento and Potrandolfo, and the Caler River, hearing the news and acting upon it, and Monte Sacivo. From here, the line of intense fighting between the Allied forces extends directly westward to the Tyrrhenian coast north of Naples. In the aforementioned battle lines, there are only small-scale activities by a company or even a platoon of enemy soldiers, engaged in nothing more than reconnaissance. However, north of Naples, the American army has concentrated heavy artillery, and it is possible that General Clark will launch a new offensive in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - A war bulletin from the German Führer's headquarters on the 6th stated: On the southern Italian front, anti-axis forces attacked the German rearguard several times with several companies or even several battalions, but the German forces inflicted heavy damage and drove them back. The German forces fiercely attacked the anti-axis military tanks and armored vehicle groups that landed in Tiemuli and sank three large landing craft of 3,000 tons. In the anti-bandit operations in the Istria region, the German forces captured many prisoners and inflicted heavy damage on the guerrilla forces.</p>
<h3>Fascist Republican Government Decides to Move to Northern Italy; Rome Remains an Undefended City</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from Rome, the Italian Fascist Republican Government plans to move from Rome to a certain location in northern Italy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) - Dr. Forster stated in the Berlin Financial Newspaper that the Italian government's move from Rome to the north was actually caused by the impact of the war and the shift of the political center of gravity. This move by the Italian government is an important decision made voluntarily and is not a relocation forced by the enemy. It is actually because the main base of Italian resistance is in that area. To say that Rome can still only benefit various tasks is to conceal the true situation, because Rome is vulnerable to maritime threats, and the possibility of its communications being suddenly cut off by the enemy exists.</p>
<p>Rome, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - General Reyenho, commander of the German garrison in Rome, told a Huitong News Agency reporter: Rome is not occupied by the German army, and this city is still unrelated to the German army. Apart from the Italian police authorities slightly restricting their hours of activity, the private lives of the residents of Rome are not affected in any way. Currently, only a small number of German troops are stationed in Rome, and the nature of Rome as an undefended city remains unchanged. The German troops stationed in the city only provide the necessary assistance to the Italian police, making it easier for them to perform their duties. The Italian police are equipped with the necessary weapons under the unified command of the Italian authorities to quickly prevent riots or communists. Also, Rome does not feel a shortage of food because the German authorities have found ways to obtain special food supplies. When asked about the situation of the German army defending the Vatican, the reply was that when Rome became a war zone and the Italian army was unable to defend the Holy City for 24 hours, German paratroopers took over this task for the Italian army, and the Pope and the Swiss Guards deeply understood this action. There was an existing camp in the Vatican, so the paratroopers did not need to sleep in the open, and we even used the Vatican's hospital to treat the wounded and sick. Until now, no minor incidents have occurred, which is very fortunate. Recently, the most important event in Rome has often been Marshal Graziani's speech. The reporter spoke with the marshal for a long time, and it was learned that German-Italian relations were as friendly as ever.</p>
<p>German Submarines in the Atlantic Use New Magnetic Torpedoes</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, the "Washington Post" strongly argued that when German submarines resume full-scale active operations, the Atlantic war will be the most important act of this war with a decisive nature. The strategy and weapons of German submarines have been improved. Washington has received reliable news indicating that German submarines have new magnetic torpedoes with extremely high explosive power. Ships encountering attacks are all overwhelmed, and anti-Axis merchant ships in the Atlantic have begun to suffer tragic events.</p>
<h3>German Withdrawal Plan Completed; Holding New Positions; Soviet Troops Concentrated in Lower Dnieper River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Huitong News Agency, Soviet claims that the Soviet offensive has been halted by mud are regarded as completely inaccurate by German military experts, as the muddy season has not yet arrived. According to the southern part of the Eastern Front, there has been little rainfall, and although there have been heavy rains in the central region for several days, they have already stopped. The cessation of the Soviet offensive is actually due to the completion of the German army's shortening of its defensive lines. A German military spokesman stated the day before yesterday that the German army will hold its current positions. The German High Command considered the possibility of Soviet attacks in Kody when shortening the defensive lines. The German army made meticulous plans during the withdrawal, not only carrying important war equipment but also carrying agricultural supplies. Most of the population in the evacuated area followed the German army in its retreat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German Führer's headquarters announced at noon on the 6th: There was local fighting in the northern part of the Taman Peninsula. Soviet troops who landed at the Kuban bridgehead were completely wiped out after fierce hand-to-hand combat. German forces crushed the attacks of the Polish army in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. Bombardment and fierce attacks have forcibly suppressed the Soviet bridgehead positions. There is still intense fighting on both sides of the Pripet Marshes. South of Gomel and west of Smolensk, Soviet forces attempted to break through the German lines and stubbornly counterattacked, but all failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to military correspondent Setorius of Huitong News Agency: Although it cannot be said that the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has completely stopped, there are clear signs that its offensive power has been fatigued, especially in the southern section. The offensive strategy of the [Soviet] side has obviously had to be abandoned. The Soviet General Staff's plan to start the mud season with vigor, using a pincer movement on the Gomel and Smolensk-Minsk highways, to break through the German Dnieper River defense line is probably no longer highly valued. In recent days, the Soviet advance in that area has become slow, while German resistance has become stronger. The war situation there has also become more stable. On Tuesday, the Soviet army only launched a more intense offensive east of Orsha and north of Gomel, but all were repelled. In other areas of the central section of the Eastern Front, there were only local skirmishes. On the Dnieper River front, Soviet forces were only struggling in a small area at the mouth of the Lyubet River in an attempt to expand the area of their bridgehead on both banks. In other bridgeheads, the Soviet army seems to have been unable to engage in similar struggles due to a lack of fresh troops. The Soviet troops in this area have been forced to switch from offensive to defensive under pressure from German counterattacks. The Soviet army does not seem likely to immediately abandon its plan to break through the line. Although the Soviet army is currently unable to launch another major offensive center, it still seems to have the strength to do so between the Dnieper River and the Sea of Azov. The concentration of troops behind the enemy in Zaporozhye and Melitopol can confirm this statement. Of course, if the Soviet army attacks in this area, the German army will certainly not be unprepared.</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference to Open in Soviet Union; Britain Announces Entourage Personnel</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reported: German political figures pointed out that although Britain and the United States have announced that the foreign ministers of the three countries will soon meet in Moscow, the Soviet Union has been reluctant to comment on this matter, which is worthy of attention. The United States' news agency mentioned the minimum demands that Moscow intends to propose at this meeting, which is worthy of consideration. It is said that the Soviet Union wants to incorporate parts of Poland and Finland, as well as the Baltic states, into Soviet territory, and that Soviet influence will extend to other "countries that are friendly to the Soviet Union but do not necessarily have to be governed by communist governments," such as Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Iran. German political figures believe that these reports are test balloons released by Britain and the United States, but they have not yet received a response from Moscow. Britain has also recently published the long-term history of the Allied aid to the Soviet Union in order to counter the demands that the Soviet Union will put forward.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - London officially announced yesterday: When British Foreign Secretary Eden goes to Moscow for the anti-Axis Three-Nation Conference, his entourage will include British Lord Suwentong, one of whom is Undersecretary Sterang. From 1930 to 1933, Mr. Shi served as the British Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union. Others include Zhang Xun and Eden's personal secretary, Harvey. The former Secretary-General of the External Affairs Ministry, Maidegan monk, who accompanied Eden to Moscow for preliminary consultations on the Anglo-Soviet Convention, will not accompany him this time. In addition, it is also reported that General Ismay, the military adjutant of the wartime cabinet, is among Eden's entourage, which shows that military questions may be discussed at the meeting. It is also learned that the new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, who is now in London, will also go to his post with several senior military officers.</p>
<p>Geneva, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from Mexico City: Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hevis, met with Soviet Ambassador to Mexico, Shimansky, in Mexico City. This is believed to be a preparation for the Anglo-American-Soviet foreign ministers' conference. Shimansky is not only considered to be a close advisor to Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov but also the leader of the Soviet diplomatic representatives in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: The new Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Gusev, arrived in London on Saturday and visited British Foreign Secretary Eden at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.</p>
<h3>The European War and the Balkan Countries (II)</h3>
<p>Bulgaria</p>
<p>King Boris III of Bulgaria passed away on August 28th. The six-year-old young emperor, Simeon II, ascended the throne, and it was decided to form a regency government composed of Prince Kirill, Prime Minister Filov, and Minister of the Army Mihov to support the young emperor.</p>
<p>After the European War, when King Ferdinand abdicated and King Boris ascended the throne, the leader of the Agrarian Party, Stamboliyski, was the one who influenced Bulgarian politics. Since the collapse of this Agrarian Party cabinet in the coup of 1923, King Boris's voice in politics gradually strengthened. Since the first cabinet of King Boris's trusted aide-de-camp, Kioseivanov, was established at the end of 1935, it seemed that the king was gradually exerting dictatorial power. The neutral policy in the early stage of the war gradually took on a pro-German color after the Filov cabinet was established. After signing and joining the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy on March 23, 1941, as one of the Axis powers, this change in policy was implemented under the king's guidance.</p>
<p>In view of the king's dictatorial position, the king's sudden death will be a considerable blow to Bulgaria. Especially when British and American activities in the Balkans through Ankara and Istanbul have recently become increasingly intense, the future political trends are quite noteworthy. Bulgaria's foreign policy, since joining the Tripartite Pact on March 1, 1941, was determined to be an enemy to many. On the 5th of the same month, it severed diplomatic relations with Britain, and Bulgaria's funds in the United States were also frozen at the same time. However, Bulgaria's policy differs from that of other Balkan warring states in its relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Originally, Bulgarians were a tribe of the Turkish nation. Because they migrated from the Volga region, their language is similar to the Slavic Russian language, and in society, they also have feelings close to Russia. This point continued even after the Russian Revolution. Therefore, after the start of the German-Soviet war, only Bulgaria insisted on a neutral policy, which is quite similar to Japan's position. Therefore, when Japan and Bulgaria decided to exchange ministers last year, the first minister, Mr. Beeff, was able to go to Tokyo via Siberia to take office.</p>
<p>Although this neutral policy towards the Soviet Union is the same as the position of Japan, it does not weaken Bulgaria's cooperation with Germany. Following the progress of the war against Britain, it actively assisted Germany militarily and economically.</p>
<p>The basis for this Bulgarian policy of cooperation with Germany is the economic dependence on Germany and German assistance to Bulgaria in recovering lost territories. Let's try to explain the history of Bulgaria's recovery of lost territories.</p>
<p>A Page in the History of the Recovery of Lost Territories</p>
<p>In 1896, under King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, with the assistance of Austria, it gained independence from Turkey, but this independence was not recognized by the nations until 1909. Later, it participated in the First Balkan War, drove the oppressor Turkey out of Europe, but later retreated due to infighting over the distribution of occupied territories, and once lost the occupied territories. Furthermore, as a result of its defeat in the World War, it had to pay huge reparations, and at the same time, southern Bulgaria was ceded to Romania, and Thrace was ceded to Greece.</p>
<p>The recovery of these lost territories has been Bulgaria's hope for many years. One part of the hope was fulfilled when, according to the German-Italian Vienna Arbitration, southern Dobruja was ceded from Romania.</p>
<p>The following year, in March, because Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, German troops entered Bulgaria. In response, British troops landed in Greece. In April, Yugoslavia's cooperation with the British army was the result of Germany's Balkan operations being unavoidable. When the German army entered Yugoslavia, the Bulgarian army also cooperated in advancing into Macedonia and Thrace. Thereafter, the Bulgarian army and the German army together took on the task of guarding parts of Macedonia and Thrace in Yugoslavia with several divisions.</p>
<p>Industry and Trade</p>
<p>80% of Bulgaria's residents are engaged in agriculture, and 70% of its cultivated area is planted with grains. The amount of grain harvested is 4 million tons in an average year, making it one of the leading grain exporting countries in the Balkans. The amount harvested in 1940 was 15% less than the average year, and it decreased by 20% in 1941 and 1942. The harvest situation was extremely unfavorable. Due to local food shortages, after the harvest in 1941, grain was no longer exported. This year's planting is said to be quite good.</p>
<p>In the coal mining sector, out of a total output of 1.67 million kilograms, 1.36 million kilograms are government coal mines. Most of the small number of mining industries are state-owned.</p>
<p>Next, speaking of trade, the main exports are tobacco, sugar, woven products, fruits, and vegetables. Trade with Germany accounts for the majority. The ratio of trade with Germany to the overall rate increased from 52% in 1938 to 79% in 1941, and from 58% in 1938 to 68% in 1941. The recent export and import amounts and the amount of trade with Germany are shown below:</p>

Occasionally, when collection and delivery were announced, it was only for small packages, or for personal parcels only. It is now learned that the bureau, through standardized methods, has  made water and land postal services to various regions  more convenient, and it is hoped that the collection and delivery of all parcels, large and small, will be gradually restored. According to an investigation by a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday, regarding large commodity parcels sent from Shanghai to Guangzhou, the  parcel delivery  is about to resume collection and delivery. However, in order to avoid congestion at that time, all necessary  procedures, and details,  should be completed  starting today.  Before the resumption of collection and delivery,  these parcels must not be moved into the post office for storage. The group has already issued a public notice to this effect. As for the parcels currently being sent, the majority are from Japan, followed by various parts of North China.</p>

<h3>Economic Circles  Free Trading of Bid Bonds</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai, said that the Business Control Committee had requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance on the question of whether merchants should be allowed to freely trade the bid bonds paid by the government for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and whether there should be any restrictions on prices. The Ministry of Finance has now officially replied to the committee, stating that the nationalization of gold has not been implemented, and each yarn and cloth merchant who receives bid bonds may freely trade them, and there are no restrictions on prices.</p>
<p>If this news is true, then not only will the general public's doubts about whether the government can truly purchase cotton yarn and cloth with bid bonds be dispelled, but also the rumors that gold will be nationalized at a limited price will be eliminated. Because if the government  really wants to nationalize gold in the near future, then why  go to the trouble of paying out gold bars first to buy cotton yarn and cloth? A dignified government order is neither a child's play nor a trap. Yarn and cloth merchants seem to be able to rest assured on this point from now on.</p>
<p>The government's move to purchase cotton yarn and cloth with bid bonds has not only achieved the satisfactory results of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood in coastal areas, but also seems to have a subtle effect on stabilizing the value of currency in inland China. Because ten days ago,  it was reported that the United States had agreed to transport 160 tons of funds (worth approximately 200 million US dollars) to Chongqing as part of the previous 500 million US dollar loan, in order to contract the circulation of currency in the interior and increase its purchasing power. If this news is true, it is a wise measure by the friendly nation, but it has stimulated Chongqing to imitate in a ridiculous manner.</p>
<h3>All Industries Should Strictly Abide by  Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions  The Weights and Measures Used Must Meet Standards</h3>
<p>The "Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions" formulated by the trade associations of various industries in this city have been submitted to and approved for implementation by the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Grain Bureau. All member merchants of the respective trade associations, whether retail or wholesale, must uniformly abide by these "Trade Regulations for Inter-Trade Transactions" and must not intentionally violate them. In addition to complying with the price limits set by the association, the weights and measures used must also meet standards. The points to be followed are recorded below:</p>
<p>Key Points of Trade Regulations</p>
<p>When dealing with customers, if there is an agreement or contract, it should be handled in accordance with the agreement or contract. The market price for inter-trade transactions shall be freely determined by both parties based on fair principles. Agreements or contracts with an overall commonality shall be reported separately to the relevant authorities.  The market price for customers shall be fairly discussed and decided by the association based on the cost. Strict compliance is required.  The selling price shall be based on the exchanged bills or invoices. No additions or deductions shall be made during settlement to show good faith. Currency shall be based on the Shanghai common currency system, otherwise, it shall be adjusted according to the market rate.  Newly established companies and firms must register with the association within one week, fill out a membership application, and receive the articles of association and trade regulations.  Any member who has joined the association must report any changes in shareholders, increases or decreases in capital, or changes in managers in writing at any time.  All trades must use weights and measures prescribed by the government.  Customers who wish to pre-order futures must issue a transaction order, stating the type of goods, price, quantity, and delivery date.</p>
<p>The End of October is Approaching  Bankers and Financiers Adjust Finances</p>
<p>After the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee has made every effort to adjust the finances of bankers and financiers, all member bankers and financiers may, in accordance with the new borrowing method, provide property to the committee for</p>
<p>Applying for Call Loans</p>
<p>However, money shops must re-lend through the Money Industry Reserve. Each inter-trade loan shall be based on 200,000 yuan, and shall be limited to the sum of 20% of the total current deposits of each inter-trade plus the base amount. For those whose current deposits exceed 30 million yuan, the loan amount for the excess portion shall be calculated at 10%. Therefore, as the end of October approaches, all bankers and financiers are able to</p>
<p>Cope with Ease</p>
<p>The money supply remains and there is no excessive emergency. However, all bankers and financiers will provide assistance to industries and commerce within the scope of possibility, but those that do not meet the new loan restrictions, such as funds required for speculation and hoarding, will be completely rejected and absolutely no accommodation will be given. It is also learned that the money shops that use long-term loans, usually take the end of April and the end of October as the new loan and repayment periods. Although the amount of loans due at the end of October is not large, all shops will continue to</p>
<p>Accommodate Lending</p>
<p>For new loans, a reliable guarantor must be provided before they can be processed. Regarding the internal conference, the Money Industry Association will hold it as usual at the end of October, but the date is still subject to the decision of the board of directors.</p>
<h3>Work of Various Trade Associations  Actively Underway</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system and assist the government in completing the economic control policy, the major and secondary trade associations in this city have successively followed the orders of the主管官署, to change the level. In addition to passing the articles of association, they have also elected the first board of directors and supervisors. The work of reorganizing the trade associations in this city started in April of this year and has been underway for nearly half a year. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities concerned and the persons in charge of various associations, the results have been quite satisfactory. The reorganization of the associations in this city can now be said to be coming to an end. All the major associations have been reorganized, and eighty or ninety percent of the secondary associations have also been reorganized. Under the Business Control Committee, there are 23 joint associations, and there are about 200 associations belonging to other major agencies.</p>
<p>Actively Develop Association Affairs</p>
<p>The organizational work of the trade associations has been completed and they are now actively developing association affairs. According to the focus of the work of each association, there are approximately the following points:  Joint procurement, storage, transportation, and sale of materials operated by members.  Joint acquisition and distribution of raw materials and fuels required for the manufacture of materials by members.  Deliberation of the production quantity and selling price of materials operated by members.  Adjustment of business funds and guarantee of debts of members.  Adjustment, statistics, design, guidance, inspection, and supervision of members' business operations.  Performing matters designated or entrusted by the competent authority.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were still in a consolidation state. Large investors were watching, and retail investors were mostly selling under the control of banks. Except for the Xinya  Pharmaceutical Factory, which still had no shortage of buyers, most other stocks were hovering  and showing a sluggish state. The stock market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals  Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory once rose higher, but slightly declined at noon, and was flat and sluggish in the afternoon; Zhongfa and Zhongying were priced flat; Lizhou, Zhongxi, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory each showed a decline.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stock Compendium  Being Reprinted</h3>
<p>Since the "Pocket Chinese Stock Compendium" was sold by the Enterprise Weekly (Majestic Building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road), buyers have flocked to it and demand has exceeded supply. This morning, another batch was bound and ready to supply readers, and efforts are being made to reprint it.</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial Conditions</h3>
<p>Call Loan Interest  Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.9 points, but suddenly it was 1.1 points, and the money supply was obviously tight.</p>
<p>Edible Oil The supply of edible oil in this city has gradually become abundant recently, because a large amount of freely circulating goods have been transported to Shanghai. In addition to goods from Bengbu, Wuxi, etc., there are also shipments from Dalian, Qingdao, etc. Therefore, the current stock in Shanghai is particularly abundant, and there is no fear of shortage in the future.</p>
<p>Rayon  is moving into a better state, because after the suspension of cotton cloth sales, silk sales have gradually become active, and silk factories have also added raw materials to step up production. Therefore, actual sales are very smooth, and prices are rising steadily, especially for miscellaneous brands.</p>
<h3>Ren Ji Tang: Over Sixty Years of Operation, A Classical Charitable Organization (Part 2)</h3>
<p>"It's hard to open the door to charity," used to be just a catchphrase for miserly people. But today, to run a truly charitable enterprise, one indeed feels this way.</p>
<p>Financial Straits</p>
<p>Take the Ren Ji Charity Hall in Shanghai for example. It is the oldest and arguably most established charitable organization in Shanghai. It not only has a group of capable and loyal staff, but also considerable assets, mainly rental income from real estate. In the past, it often had several hundred or even a thousand in income, which was quite something. Moreover, due to its outstanding performance and long-standing reputation, donations poured in from all walks of life. Furthermore, businesses like pharmacies were willing to let them purchase medicine on credit, with payments made once a year during festivals. Therefore, although not wealthy, it wasn't too financially strained. However, the situation changed after the war. The rental income from real estate increased only slightly, reaching just over a thousand per month. How could that cover all expenses? Moreover, this amount had to be reduced by expenses such as water, electricity, taxes, and insurance, which had increased manyfold! General operational expenses also increased with the high prices of goods. Not only were ongoing commitments like widow and poverty relief, and medical services unwilling to be stopped, even dispensing medicine led to a large "deficit" in the Hall's accounts due to rising drug prices. According to this year's budget, income is estimated at 186,624.52 yuan, while expenditure is estimated at 323,412.83 yuan, a shortfall of 136,788.31 yuan? Moreover, this is calculated based on last year's year-end currency value. Now, income will certainly not increase, and there are concerns it may not even be sufficient. However, expenditure is bound to exceed the budgeted amount many times over due to high prices, so the deficit will naturally be even more alarming. This shortfall can only be remedied by relying on the assistance of philanthropists from all walks of life. However, in reality, perhaps due to the economic recession, it is said that the Ren Ji Charity Hall has received very few donations recently.</p>
<p>This spring, it applied for a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. Committee member Yu Yonghua went to investigate and considered that it was in urgent need of assistance. After review, it was decided to subsidize the medicine dispensing program by 10,000 yuan per month for six months, totaling 60,000 yuan (the amount of subsidy for the infant care program is detailed below), so that the Hall's medicine dispensing program could be restored. However, the actual shortfall is still large and urgently needs greater donations from philanthropists from all walks of life. Of course, the Ren Ji Charity Hall's activities are multifaceted. In addition to cash, it is also very eager to receive donations of Chinese and Western medicines. Soon, autumn will end and winter will come, and the work of distributing clothing and relieving poverty will become tense again. They are also happy to collect and distribute used clothing.</p>
<p>Number 157 Race Course Road, across the race course from the International Hotel. Although it is just a row of bamboo fences and a few old Chinese-style buildings, it radiates the light of human mutual aid. The bamboo fence has large characters, one meter in diameter, that read "Ren Ji Infant Home" - the other operation of Shanghai Ren Ji Charity Hall, specializing in caring for abandoned infants.</p>
<p>Ren Ji Infant Home</p>
<p>Pushing open the gate, one hears the cries of infants! Ah! It turns out that the small rooms are filled with little babies who have just been born! Director Gao Ziwen led the way to visit each room. The first section is the artificial nutrition department, occupying two rooms. Twenty-two small iron beds are neatly arranged, each with a lively and lovely baby. These pitiful children, abandoned just yesterday or a few months ago, have finally been rescued! Look! The instructors are caring for them so meticulously. Head nurse Bu Wenyu said that in addition to her, the artificial nutrition department has eight other nurses, divided into three shifts, each working eight hours, day and night, taking turns to care for, feed, and bathe the babies according to a fixed schedule. They also measure weight and temperature once a day, recording them separately for doctors to check. Infant food is mainly milk powder and milk cake. Fortunately, Zhen Nong Milk Company donates a lot of milk every day, so nutrition is barely adequate.</p>
<p>The three rooms on the east side all belong to the natural nutrition department, arranged with forty or fifty small rattan cradles. The babies' faces are rosy and very lively. It is said that there are now eighteen wet nurses responsible for caring for the infants in the natural nutrition department, each responsible for two or three babies. In total, it can accommodate more than fifty infants. If there are too many infants, milk powder and other substitutes are used to supplement the lack of breast milk. There is a female administrator in charge of the wet nurses' attendance and dismissal.</p>
<p>Most of the abandoned infants received by the Ren Ji Infant Home are already difficult to treat by the time they are abandoned by poor parents, so they often die before they can be saved. However, Director Gao said that as long as there is a breath left, they will do their best to treat the children's illnesses. They pay special attention to the health of the infants after they enter the home. When an infant is received, they are immediately examined and diagnosed, and their physical strength is recorded in the infant admission book. They usually hire Chinese and Western doctors to treat sick infants in the home. Massage therapist Ms. Shen Zhesan works in the home for most of the day. When the reporter visited, she was busy treating an infant with a fever.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems that the only formal adoption agency for abandoned infants in Shanghai's first and eighth districts (former Public Concession and French Concession) is this Ren Ji Infant Home. Therefore, it has become an "assembly point" for abandoned infants in Shanghai. However, this "assembly point" has been in operation for decades. As early as twenty-four years before the Republic of China, in the first month of the fourteenth year of Guangxu, the Ren Ji Charity Hall established the "Infant Retention Bureau" in Dang Nei Yu, specializing in the care of abandoned infants and those unable to raise them. Special wet nurses were prepared to feed and care for them, in order to fulfill God's virtue of cherishing life. However, due to limitations in location, funding, and other factors, everything was simplified as much as possible, and it was not possible to adopt more infants. Later, because of the serious management and remarkable reputation, more and more people in society sympathized and supported it, and funding gradually became sufficient. Therefore, the scale was slightly expanded, and the number of adoptions also increased day by day. It was officially named "Ren Ji Infant Home." In the ninth year of the Republic of China, directors of various halls and ten gentry raised funds to purchase houses on Race Course Road, and the work of housing and caring for abandoned children was considered to be on the right track.</p>
<p>The infants cared for by the Ren Ji Infant Home are allowed to be adopted by those who lack children, but a certain procedure must be followed. First, an application for adoption must be filled out. After the hall reviews it, a blank guarantee form is issued, which is filled out by the adoptive parents and guarantors and sent to the hall. Then, the hall sends staff to investigate. If it is deemed that they are indeed of good background, have a legitimate occupation, and can bear all the expenses of the adopted infant, the hall will notify them that they are approved for adoption, and then they can go to take the infant. The hall must also monitor the adoptive parents' treatment of the adopted infant to ensure that it is treated the same as their own children. They send staff to investigate the adopted children at any time. If they are not satisfied, they will issue a warning or take the child back, depending on the severity of the situation. However, according to reports, the adopted infants are generally doing well. Surprisingly, even in these difficult times, there are still many people who go to adopt infants. According to statistics, from January to August of this year, a total of 678 infants were received, of which 46% were kept for care or were sick and disabled, and 54% were adopted out. Otherwise, if there were fewer adoptions, how could the infant home have thousands of spacious rooms?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, due to the general social and economic difficulties, the number of people who are unable to raise their children and abandon them reluctantly is indeed increasing day by day. Conversely, there are not many who are truly able to adopt them. It is also worth noting that a large proportion of abandoned children are sick infants, so the mortality rate of infants after admission is very high. Whether from a human perspective or from the perspective of the future of society and the country, people with conscience cannot ignore this phenomenon. We must take in a large number of abandoned infants, we must improve infant medical equipment in order to reduce the infant mortality rate, and ideally, we should be able to do as the Xujiahui Mother and Infant Home and the Nanshi Xin Pu Yu Hall Infant Home do, raising infants from infancy to kindergarten, primary school, and even adulthood, cultivating useful talents for society and the country. However, the realization of this ideal first requires funding. And now, the funding of the Ren Ji Infant Home, the only large-scale infant care institution in the first and eighth districts, is in extreme difficulty. Although administrative expenses have been reduced to the minimum, the staff, including male and female workers, two female administrators, one head nurse, one resident doctor, eight nurses, and eighteen wet nurses, are all paid poorly. Apart from a subsidy of 360 yuan for rice expenses for most, only four or five people have salaries above 100 yuan, and wet nurses receive only 53 yuan per month. But despite the savings, there is still a feeling of being stretched thin. At the beginning of the year, it applied for a subsidy from the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Disease Relief Association. After the committee investigated, it was deemed necessary to provide immediate assistance. Later, starting in February, it subsidized the infant care program by 3,600 yuan per month for six months, making the home feel slightly more relaxed. The current difficulties are that the infants' clothes are torn and the wet nurses' bedding cannot be purchased. The difficulty is that the wet nurses are paid too poorly, far less than domestic servants, and are difficult to hire. The most important difficulty is the lack of general donations. In order to sustain the only abandoned infant care program in the first and eighth districts, we look forward to enthusiastic donations from kind people in society. (The End)</p>

<h3>Discussion on Improving the Grain Problem</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>(G) Utilizing Agriculture (Mechanization: If agricultural mechanization can increase production and reduce costs, why not? American farmers account for only 4% of the world's agricultural workers, yet they produce 70% of the world's corn, 60% of the cotton, 20% of the wheat, and many other agricultural products. This is due to the application of agricultural machinery. In 1936, the Soviet Union had 80,000 plows and 193,000 tractors used in agricultural production, plus many other machines, which were expected to increase total agricultural output by 23.6%. Although China cannot use large-scale machinery for cultivation like the United States, the provinces in North China, at least, should be able to use plows, tractors, and other new machinery like the Soviet Union for cultivation. As for irrigation, drainage, threshing, and other similar tasks, electric machinery can be widely used to replace manpower and animal power. According to reports from Suzhou, Jiangsu, using electric pumps for irrigation can save two-thirds of the cost compared to manual water pumping. This shows the importance of agricultural mechanization in promoting agricultural production! See page 194 of "A Re-examination of China's Grain Problem".)</p>
<p>(H) Activating Rural Finance</p>
<p>Most of China's farmers are not only intellectually disadvantaged but also economically strained. Their annual income cannot even maintain a minimum standard of living. Mencius' saying, "In good years, they suffer all their lives; in bad years, they cannot escape death," truly describes their situation. Therefore, improving agricultural production is not only limited by intelligence but also hindered by economics. It must be promoted by the government to proceed step by step. In the current situation, capital is essential for improving agricultural production. Whether it is improving seeds, improving irrigation and drainage, preventing pests and diseases, improving fertilization, or using agricultural machinery, it all requires money. It is necessary for the government to raise large sums of money to provide agricultural loans with lower interest rates and longer terms to stimulate rural finance and increase agricultural production. It is best for the government to organize rural credit cooperatives, encouraging farmers to cooperate and help each other and avoid exploitation by intermediaries, such as cooperative purchasing of necessities, cooperative use of new agricultural tools or livestock, cooperative irrigation and drainage, etc. The hope is that costs will be reduced, production will be increased, and the lives of farmers will be improved. As for the transportation and sale of agricultural products, this cooperative can also be used to connect with the government's purchases, not only achieving results but also benefiting farmers, the government, and consumers, truly killing several birds with one stone.</p>
<p>(II) Government Purchase and Control After increasing grain production, the second step is to discuss purchasing matters. Because regulating military needs and supplying food to the people cannot be done effectively without government control of purchases, the author sees the following three points:</p>
<p>(A) The Issue of Purchasing Agencies Purchases must be handled uniformly so that things can be done effectively. This can avoid the drawbacks of competition and also avoid shirking responsibility. According to the previous situation, it was originally handled by the Ministry of Food, but according to recent laws, it has been transferred to the Grain Control Committee.</p>
<p>(B) The Issue of Purchasing Regions and Quantities This issue is more complex and technical. Without precise statistics on the population and production of each region, it can easily lead to problems. For example, if a certain county produces an average of 3 million shi of rice annually and has a population of 400,000, with each person consuming 2 shi of rice per year, then a total of 1.2 million shi of rice can be exported annually. In other words, the government's purchase quantity should not exceed this quantity, nor should it be less than this quantity. If it exceeds this quantity, the local food supply will be panicked. If it does not reach this quantity, the local food supply will be excessive. Both excess and deficiency will cause panic. Observing the current situation of rice purchases, it seems that this point has not been noticed, resulting in soaring rice prices, harming both the government and the people. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to improvement and make adjustments, starting with a detailed purchase plan!</p>
<p>(C) The Issue of Purchase Prices and Timing These two issues are also closely related. The appropriate time to purchase rice should be after the grain is harvested and should end before the end of the year, in order to purchase large quantities for the next year's use. Unless there are unavoidable accidents, the time should not be extended. Buying when supplies are running out will only result in limited quantities and public panic. The so-called "carts fighting for food" is unacceptable. As for the price of rice purchased, it can be cheaper after the new grain is harvested, but to take into account the livelihood of farmers, the price set should satisfy them, and the interests of consumers can also be considered. Furthermore, it is best to avoid the involvement of intermediaries as much as possible. If it is done through rural cooperatives, it can be said to be the most ideal.</p>
<p>(III) Storage and Control The growth of grains is mostly seasonal, so although the harvest period varies due to different climates, it is generally within four months. However, the need for food for the general public is year-round, and the monthly proportion does not change much. Examining the general situation in China, rice is harvested around the eighth and ninth months of the lunar calendar and mostly sold in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and third months (referring to the lunar calendar, same below). Wheat is harvested in May and mostly sold in June, July, and August. Due to the oversupply during the harvest season and the lack of food during the lean season, a system of storing grain is needed to adjust surpluses and shortages and stabilize prices. China has a long history of warehouse systems, the most famous being Li Kui's Ever-Normal Granary in the Warring States period, Changsun Ping's Charitable Granary in the Sui Dynasty, and Zhu Xi's Community Granary in the Southern Song Dynasty. Talking about storage and control today is simply restoring past methods, and the government has already implemented it. The author has the following points to make it more complete:</p>
<p>(A) Construction and Location of Warehouses The scale of warehouse construction must be large, and efforts should be made to improve fire prevention, disaster prevention, and ventilation facilities to ensure that the stored grain is safe and can be stored for a relatively long time. As for the location of warehouses, of course, large cities with convenient transportation and large populations are the most suitable because it is easy to collect and distribute grain. The warehouses for storing grain in China today have been decided to be managed by the government, and there should be an overall plan to prepare for the maximum amount of grain that should be stored each year, and then select suitable locations to build warehouses to form a grain warehouse network, so that everything can be done systematically. However, given the government's current financial resources, it may be difficult to implement in a short period of time. However, this is a long-term plan to regulate surpluses and shortages and supply food to the people. It is hoped that the government will start it as soon as possible and not settle for simple solutions.</p>
<p>(B) Management of Warehouses and Storage of Grain The above two items are the tasks of the warehouse staff and can be discussed together as two sides of the same coin. Managing a warehouse is not a very difficult task, but the responsibility is very heavy, and the inflow and outflow are very important. Originally, operating a warehouse requires specialized knowledge. Given the lack of talent in China, it is difficult to demand perfection, but in weighing talent, those who are responsible and capable should be entrusted with full responsibility. Because grain is essential for the people's food supply, those who manage it should not only be very careful but also store it properly. As we know, grain will inevitably lose some weight over time. How to minimize the loss? Warehouses often have insects and rodents that eat grain. In the absence of complete warehouse facilities, how to minimize insect and rodent damage? How to keep the stored grain ventilated and dry to avoid the grain becoming red and inedible due to moisture? How to arrange grain according to grade and type so that when a notice is received, it can be distributed immediately according to the plan without making mistakes or delays? These items seem easy, but few can do them completely, and cases of corruption and fraud are often heard. Therefore, personnel issues are very important. According to the Shenbao of September 5, the grain warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been ordered by the Ministry of Food to be completed within a time limit, and they are divided into first, second, and third classes according to the complexity of the work, and principles and methods are stipulated. In the future, the storage of grain will be properly handled.</p>
<p>(IV) Transportation and Control If there is no transportation mechanism for purchasing rice, transporting it to warehouses, and allocating it to various places in prescribed quantities each month, then the geographical and temporal utility in economics cannot be realized. In China, the domestic transportation and sale of grain is usually expensive and time-consuming, which leads to the import of foreign rice and increases the crisis in rural areas. Currently, due to the war, foreign rice cannot be imported, and all domestic transportation agencies have limited capacity due to frequent military transportation. Therefore, to achieve rapid rice transportation and achieve good results, it is necessary to establish a practical and responsible rice transportation and sales control agency. The author believes that the following points are worth noting:</p>
<p>(A) Establishment of a Unified Transportation System In order to make grain circulation smooth and achieve the purpose of adjusting supply and demand, it is necessary to establish a unified transportation system. In Shanghai, the previous Rice Joint Operating Society failed to complete the task of flexible transportation and sales and needs to be improved. It is hoped that the future rice transportation agency can recruit talents in shipping and land transportation, so that the transportation of rice can be expedited and the people will not have to wait for the rice allocation like waiting for rain during a drought, and can get sufficient quantities, which can be said to have achieved the task. As for personnel adjustments and the reduction of losses during transportation, with the leadership of maritime elites, they will be able to appoint the capable and command effectively, and eliminate the past stains.</p>
<p>(B) Construction of a Transportation Network Due to the current lack of transportation tools, the transportation of grain is deeply felt to be painful. Therefore, it is necessary to first construct a transportation network with sufficient transportation tools to prevent unexpected situations from occurring. First, in land transportation, it is not easy to use trucks on highways. In railway transportation, military transportation should be given priority, and at the same time, efforts should be made to negotiate for the transportation of rice as much as possible without delay. In addition, attention should be paid to unified transportation, and available ships should be used as much as possible. Although they are not fully sufficient, tugboats or wooden boats should be used to supplement the shortage of trains. Although the time will be relatively long, it can transport large quantities. If supplies are abundant, the people's hearts can be stabilized, and prices will not rise. Therefore, the speed of the transportation agency is of great importance to the supply of food.</p>
<p>(V) Rationing and Control In Shanghai, rice has already been under control, and a ticket system for rice and flour has been implemented to allocate grain according to the number of people. However, in the rest of the country, each region is still acting on its own. If it is hoped that grain control can achieve the greatest effect, then a comprehensive rationing system is necessary. Given the government's control power and the customs of the people in various places, there are still many difficulties to overcome in implementing comprehensive rationing, which need to be resolved. The first step may be to implement it in major cities first, and then extend it to other counties and remote areas. In order to make the consumption quantity of celebrities meet the standards and to make the relationship between the country and the people closer, a comprehensive rationing system can be said to be imperative. The author believes that there are several points worth noting, which are written below:</p>
<p>(A) The Issue of Rationed Quantity When talking about rationing grain, it inherently implies insufficiency, so it is mostly implemented during wartime. The people should understand the government's difficulties, but the minimum standard of living of the people should be maintained, which is a natural duty, and the country must find ways to do so. Although the quantity of grain rationed in various countries during wartime is not uniform, it must be able to maintain individual health, which is the same in all countries. As for the quantity of rice rationed in Shanghai today, the situation was better before, but recently the dates have been delayed or the quantity has been reduced. Recently, there has only been one sheng of rice and two jin of flour to support the people for ten days. How can this be done? Those who have money search for it on the black market, and those who have no money have to starve. This is a very serious threat to the five million citizens of Shanghai. The mismanagement and shirking of responsibility by the Rice Joint Operating Society, as the Shenbao editorial of September 3 said, is indeed heartbreaking, and it is felt that the organization of the Chinese is not as good as the Japanese Chinese-language rice ration combination, which is responsible and capable. In short, if the rationed quantity is sufficient, then everything will be resolved. Otherwise, complaints will be even greater than this. Therefore, in the author's opinion, the rationed quantity per person per ten days should be at least five sheng of rice and two jin of flour in order to avoid starvation, to be able to work hard, and to eliminate the black market.</p>
<p>(B) The Issue of Rationed Price The price of rationed goods is generally more expensive than the purchase price, but because of government control, the degree of expensiveness is also reasonable. Of course, due to changes in the environment, the price of rice acquired has also risen, and the price of rationed goods has also tended to rise, but it is still much lower than the black market. In short, from the perspective of consumers, since rice is a daily necessity, they naturally hope that the price will be reduced as much as possible and hope that the quantity is sufficient. How eager they are!</p>
<p>(C) The Issue of Rationing Adjustment Due to the quantity of rice, although the government is trying to increase production, the abundance of the harvest is not completely controlled by manpower, especially during wartime, manpower is often insufficient, which affects the harvest. This is also a fact. Therefore, in addition to what can be done, other adjustment methods must be sought to ensure the abundance of food for the people. From a negative perspective, such as prohibiting brewing and making snacks to save rice and wheat consumption. From a positive perspective, mix miscellaneous grains such as corn and sweet potatoes to supplement the lack of staple food. When necessary, even abolish breakfast to save resources. These methods have been implemented by major powers, and China may as well do the same.</p>
<p>In short, in the steps of controlling grain, the most important things are increasing production and fair distribution. Purchasing, storing, and transporting are just necessary means from production to distribution. Although their importance is secondary, any loopholes will immediately affect the overall situation, and people should attach the same importance to them and not relax in the slightest in order to achieve satisfactory results. Furthermore, the author would like to add that the purchase of grain should be based on cash in principle, and not use grain warehouse receipts. It is true that buying with cash has the suspicion of inflating the currency, but poor farmers can get real benefits. If grain warehouse receipts are used, due to their low level of knowledge, they do not know how to use them, which will definitely affect their lives, and the source of grain in the future will be seriously hindered. Therefore, buying with cash is the best policy. As for large landowners, whose warehouses are adjacent and whose fields are vast, and whose income is very abundant, they can use grain warehouse receipts. Therefore, when levying grain, there should be a detailed plan to investigate the wealth of farmers and stipulate that a household with a certain number of qing of land, or who can be levied a certain number of shi of grain at a time, can use warehouse receipts.</p>
<h3>Grain Control Agency</h3>
<p>To ensure that grain control affairs are handled smoothly and perfectly, it is necessary to strengthen the grain control agency first. The countermeasure to strengthen the grain agency must be to simultaneously implement adjustments to the agency, rectification of personnel, and strict supervision.</p>
<p>In short, when it comes to the wartime grain issue, it is necessary to start with control. To make the control effective, the agency, personnel, and supervision of the control must be able to produce a coordinated effect. The so-called "those who submit are grateful for virtue, those who are rebellious fear punishment," internal evils can be swept away. As for external evils, in addition to the government's efforts to exempt taxes and eliminate bandits, the rest are not a problem. All grain control procedures can be followed step by step. Then, how can the grain agency be unsound? How can grain control be unsuccessful?
