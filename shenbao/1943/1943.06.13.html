<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>華並賬災中的食料</h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>介紹一種栽植易產量豐成分富的食料代替品</p>
<p>我在上月二十四日的星期論壇，寫了一篇辦賑的先決條件。倘能照此苦幹，成效較隨隨便便敷衍紛飾，或者有些實際的收穫。可是想到服務辦結之後，難題不免重疊發生，更應該早早準備纔是。從來大災旣過，因爲流離遷徙，弄得十室九空，土地荒蕪。即使來年風雨適宜，也有什麽用處。所以招撫流亡，是地方官第一件德政。但雖然有了種田的人，而種田的器具，亦因逃荒離去，必然散失極多，收集添置，又是要替他設法。幸而農具不算缺乏，人工不算懶惰，倘若沒有種子，豈非徒勞無功？前天聽見北方有許多人來信說：「現在需要米豆小麥的種子，比糧食還急」，就是這個道理。然而北方的高粱豆麥，大概多在舊歷五月前後下種，是今年已不可能。這要等待一年，請問何以爲活呢？我從前見過一位朱槐先生手寫的包豐（植物名），如果能穀得到種子，快快送到災地，那末上面所講的種種難題，全盤可以解決·現在我已覔到原稿，把他整理歸納，介紹於讀者諸君之前，能羣起謀之，幸甚，幸甚。</p>
<p>包豐的來源，是南美洲的特產，原名「Pon-feng」，譯作包豐，有時亦叫包粉，是音譯的。百年以前，盛植於爪哇，實爲薯蕷科食用植物。上决歐洲大戰，德國藏儲最富，後來靠此免於飢餓，現在聞亦賴此爲食糧主要代用品。中國不少德僑，如有熟友，何妨細細打聽。</p>
<p>他的種植生長的容易，真是聞所未聞。只要是肥沃疎鬆的泥土，不管是山崗山峽，甚至土屋牆腳，一種即活，一活即大。初種時，把前次留下的枝條，埋入土中，只要用淤泥壅塞，那枝條就在暗中四面長成球根。起初還要人工灌溉，等到發芽之後，即遇到大水大旱，毫不受其影響。所以無須管理，一直達到收穫目的。而且每年可種兩次，春季三四月，秋季七八月，正是下種的季節。下種時候，把枝條約一端枯尖削去，的留八寸，揷人土中，但注意上下，不可顛經三個月（爪哇八十日，德國一百或一百二十日）用手拔之，如能連球根拔起，即是成熟</p>
<p>他的生產數量，說來更覺奇怪。每年收穫二次，春多秋少，每枝球根的得六七斤，每畝可種四五百枝，至少可得二三十担，兩次總計的得六十担，相當於米麥之二十倍。就乾燥土地，掘成二尺深的土坑，堆積其中，上覆稻草或　糠，可保存一年以上，但經過大水，則表皮滑澤有光，不能久貯。他和我們常見的山芋，似乎有些相像，然而山芋每年祇收一次，每畝至多不過二十担，而且偶遇大水大早，亦必大受影響。况澱粉太少，祗百分之十八乃至二十，水分太多，所以不能久藏，兩兩相較，豈可同日語耶？</p>
<p>他的用途，尤其廣大，在爪哇的土番，固然是作爲普通的食料，德國戰時，亦利用爲救荒的主要物品。此外製造酒和酒精，或者醬醋，以及工業上需要的澱粉質，紡織所用的漿糊，多是俯拾即是。豈但救荒一端視爲至寶。現在再把他的成分，列表如下：</p>
<p>以上種種村料多是米槐先生費了許多功夫調查得來的。朱先生發現包豐，還在一年以前，他的動機因爲這時候米價愈漲愈高。想移種這產量豐富容易播種的東西，來替代米麵，却幫助了我們賑災的大事，倘能成功，則對於災民確是最大的恩惠。朱先生言友邦日本研究學問，提倡實用，世界聞名，想這包豐一定在試種中。如果肯將種子分些給中國，趁七月以前，送到災地，得以播種，那眞是同甘共苦共存共榮的實現。現在社會福利部與糧食部領導辦理華北賑災事宜，可謂不遺餘力，倘再做到永久的計畫，使千百萬待救災民，得到子子孫孫的依賴，這功勞將是永垂史册的。</p>
<p>近代中國所產生的世界文明的批評家辜鴻銘氏，在一九〇一年把日本的處即中國問題的方法警吿如决：</p>
<h3>真正「日本通」與「中國通」的話</h3>
<p>— 吉田束</p>
<p>「把握解決中國問題關鍵的最後之國家是日本。祗因中國問題有關於日本的國民生活的利益，故日本對其解決較任何別的國家具有重大的利害關係。日本現在的立塲，即僅以武備亦足以排斥別的國家而强行其木身的對華政策。但日本不能爲了可以這樣做，就用外國製迭的眼鏡來觀察中國。日本如其在中國問題的核心上持有正確而明晰的見解，則日本恐將成爲東亞文明的疆界防衛將軍（Mark-graf）」。（辜鴻銘著尊王篇七十七頁）</p>
<p>他警吿日本說：「不要用外國製造的眼鏡來觀察中國」，這種說法，對於當時一部分的日本人聽來頗覺刺耳，拳匪之亂以前，日本人尊中國爲文明先進國，決無跟着歐美諸列强一樣蔑視中國的情事。自從拳匪之亂，日本躋入歐美諸國的中間以來，日本始義成了用「外國製造的眼鏡」來覜察同是黃種的中國人之習慣。甲午之戰以來，這習慣在日本人之間愈加牢固起來，在中國人的耳中聽來覺得不愉快，但在日本人的耳中則好像當作一個滑稽名字來叫日本人中有人以爲中國人是文化落後一段或二段的人種。有人則和英國的「中國通」亞瑟·史密司（Arthur　Smith）一樣以爲中國人是具有所謂「誤解的才能」（Talenls　of　Misunderstandings）之特殊性格的人種。有人以爲中國人沒有愛國心，也沒有廉恥心，祇是利己生義發達的國民。是以國內在無數的利己主義的集團之問不斷地引起鬥爭。他們以爲這種國民，與其統一，母等用分治的方式，這或許是一個適當的政治形態。</p>
<p>但在日本的這種空氣中，要曉得在中國也有和日本明治維新運動一樣性格的革新運動在萌動着。他們主張培育强化這革新運動即爲亞細亞先進國日本的使命。他們以爲民國革命是在日本的明治維新中所奮起的中國之愛國運動。援助這種運動，確保中國的獨立自由，用以從英美的資本主義的侵略下保全大陸，同時亦即確保日本爲世界上强國地位之所以。他們相信解放後的亞洲大陸成爲日本的背景時，日本始能獲得排除英美壓力的力量。因此，他們對於當時動輒追隨英美的日本外交方針，頗爲不滿。爲打開這現狀，一定要使中國的民族革命達到成功。這裏引載所爲「他們」中之一的北一輝氏的話，可見他對於中國的革命運動和日本的關係認識得是如何淸楚：</p>
<p>「日本的愛國情神，漸漸在中國透露曙光，等到日本的愛國精神和他們革命黨馴熟，而他們對於日本的某一種塲合之處置，竟會煽動排日運動，其實在那個時候，就是給我們應該覺悟的敎訓，要曉得他們是沒有理解日本的眞意，……日本在十年前開始担任敎導隣國靑年，本無何種革命意味，爲日本的利益計，也亟望中國能以獨立國家的地位存在，然而他們靑年對國象的榮辱富有敏感，對國權的得失，刮目相看，日本所能滿足的希望還不是想做亞細亞的盟主而以敎導者自居嗎？甚麼同文同種，唇齒輔車，那些陳腐的親善論，他們聽得厭了，他們覺醒起來了。以爲日本想用慣於凌迫亡國階級的傅習的輕侮觀來善，他們是十足的愛國者，他們憑自已的理智與希望，認爲兩國的將來，唯有他們自身的統治，和日本的改變態度，始可以期親善……總之，中國已不是十年前的中國，由於十年前的先入之見，所推斷的吏僚與中國通所接觸的，只是中國的表面，是武漢起義即可滅亡的腐爛翻廢的亡國階級。」（北一輝著支那革命外史五六頁五八頁）</p>
<p>他把中國革命觀察爲日本愛國精神之在中國的再生，更進而又說：「日本的保全中國主義，徒然爲英國財政上併吞中國的走狗，白白枉費一塲好心，（同書一九七頁）」揭破了排日的原因。</p>
<p>北一輝氏是未敎仁的至友，是直接參加中國革命實際工作的眞正中國通。辜鴻銘有日籍夫人，曾在日本的學校執敎，是眞正的日本通。在中國政治的立塲上，前者是革命黨，後者是尊皇黨，像這樣人種不同，而政治主張各異的二個人，關於日本的對華政策，意見完全一致。前者說日本「不要做英國併吞中國的走狗」，後者說：「日本不要用外國製造的眼鏡來觀察中國」，言詞雖異，而用心則一。二人一同承認中國的獨立自由，說明和解放後的中國一同對抗英美是所以使日本成爲亞細亞的指導者且「邊疆防衛將軍」。</p>
<p>現在這種見解對中國問題在日本人間愈趨有力，所謂日本「用武力解決中國」的觀念，在日本人民開，決不受人支持，在觀念上面，解決中國問題的方向，完全被決定於這種見解所指示的方向。</p>
<p>今後的問題，在於日本如何忠實履行依據新政策所保證的中日平等關係，中國人怎樣理解日本的履行。日本果眞正逐步實現中日平等關係，則中國人亦將自知協力日本的戰爭目的，因此，九一八以來中日間感情的對立，怎樣是解決事變的關鍵，端在中國人在中日關係的現狀中所見到的日本的眞意如何。</p>
<p>今日的日本人實是承襲唐朝衣缽的眞正中國人，因蒙古（元）的侵入，自唐朝以來的眞正的　國文明的精粹除江蘇，浙江地方以外，從中國本土消逝了。那在日本仍被照舊保存着。而日本就是在東亞不許西洋人蹂躪的在一有力的國家。那麽日本和中國的關係爲何不能圓滿進行呢？那恰如「殘親奪寶的兄弟」，又恰曾似英國人與法國人的關係。但中國即是日本人所說開着美麗的花的土地，日本則是應用歐洲現代文明的利器的完備構造。在這裏，應該用東洋的道德心來保護這花與土地。（大東文化所載辜鴻銘）（六月十一日）（翔譯）</p>

<p>東京十二日中央社電　阿根廷於本月五日宣言樹立臨時政府，由拉米雷茲將軍就任臨時大總統後，即於八日遣斯特爾尼外長持公文訪交日駐阿富井大使，藉以正式通吿臨時政府之趣旨，同時表明該政府仍主張繼續維持日阿兩國傳統之友好關係，是以日本政府對各方面情勢，加以審愼考慮之結果，乃決定承認該新政府，，並已於十一日命富井大使將此意旨回覆阿根廷臨時政府，關於此事，日外務省已於本日上午十一時半正式發表。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德外交部昨日透露，德國在承認阿根廷新政府之前，曾獲該政府之保證阿根廷將暫時維持中立。柏林方面稱，阿根廷新政府曾通知德代辦謂，該政府業已秉政，並將暫維持中立，此舉實屬正當，德國方而之政策旣係不干涉他國之內政，而阿國之前總統卡斯蒂羅及前外長基尼西斯，又已返國，故德國殊無理由不承認阿根廷新政府云。柏林方面又稱，阿根廷之革命，顯係關於解決國內政治問題。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十二日中央社電　阿新政府內閣組成後，立即闡明阿國對內對外之政策大綱，九日復發表實施嚴格統制國內經濟施策，因此民心已悉趨安定，國內輿諭界亦一致對新政府表示擁護。此次新政府對內施策主要方針，在肅淸政府及排斥共產主義，現已於阿京市區內逮捕共產黨領袖多人，並將革新腐敗之政黨政治。據阿政府万而消息稱，阿國將組織與政府表裏一體協力政府，推進施策之大規模國家黨派。拉米雷茲將軍，目前對於組織新黨，雖無若何表示，但渠對於固有政黨所持態度，則頗爲冷淡，故急進黨對於政府態度，大感失敗云。</p>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社電　海通社訊，據此間負責人士宜稱，羅馬於接得阿根廷政府變動之消息後，立即將義大利正式承認通知阿國新政府，義政府並乘此時機，表示希望拉米雷茲政府將能完全以阿根廷人民利益爲前提，而施行共內政與外交政策云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十二日中央社電　昨日續有各國承認阿根廷政府，據阿政府發表之名單稱，瑞典·匈牙利·多米尼加共和國·保加利亞及波蘭荷蘭希臘之逃亡政府，均已承認阿國新政府。</p>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒十二日中央社電　據海通社駐阿根廷京城特派員電稱，阿根廷新政府，或將組織一大規模之政黨，以擁護其政策，惟拉未雷茲總統與其內閣對此計劃，究竟注意至如何程度，則尚不得而知，總之政府方面認爲「肅淸內部」及排除若干政黨領袖，已屬必要，由某種暗示而觀，吾人可斷言阿國新政府，將以最大決心，繼續對共產主義爭鬥，聞有非法共產黨運動之著名領袖數人，業遭逮捕，目前阿根廷局勢，已臻安定，隨同新政府開入京城之軍隊六千餘人，已定下週起回至距阿京十五公里之坎波狄瑪猶兵營，並將於開拔之前舉行閱兵典禮，向拉未雷茲總統及其內閣致敬云。同時阿新政府繼續公佈改組政府人選之各項新任命，計有原任工程司之巴托里尼之被任爲公用部决長，蓋樞博士之被任爲外决，財决則不更動，海陸軍之各指揮部，亦皆已另易新人，賽羅海軍少將，現專任海長，所遺海軍司令一職，巳山史錫萊諾上校繼續。史氏巳擇定戰鬥艦摩里諾號爲其旗艦，本丁上校，現已被任爲海軍參謀長，海部秘書長則由巴斯里柯上校担任，國營商船隊仍將歸海部管轄。又據郵政及電報局通知各無綫電站謂，此後宣傳，將祗限於所規定之程度，無綫電報吿員，必須用西班牙方言，並竭力避免當地俗語之應用云。</p>
<h3>科學勝利之聲（五）</h3>
<p>近幾年來，日本靑年大衆中犯近視病者愈益加多，被外國人　與一個澤名，『戴眼鏡者一定是日本人』，眞成爲全世界第一的近視眼國。但大東亞戰爭下的今天，眼睛也是優秀的兵器。爲了取得戰爭中的勝利，就不能再疏忽日益增多的靑年羣之近視眼問題。那宋成爲近視眼的原因究竟是什麽？日本的近視眼爲什麽特別多？究竟用什麽方法可以根除和預防呢？這些間題應當　敎於發表「消滅近視眼，治瘉近視眼」以及「日本的近視眼問題』的日本眼學界權戒，東京帝國大學名　敎授兼　前橋醫專校長石原忍醫學博士。</p>
<p>所謂近視眼，大家都曉得，因爲眼軸比眼的屈折力長，平行光綫集合於綱膜的前方，不把淸楚的影　集結於眼底，所以不能淸晰地看處。於此，我們可以　，近視和　視還不是一件東　。普通人認爲、「近視」全都是一樣的東西，但同樣被稱作近視的，還有屈折性近視，假性近視，軸性近視三種。屈折性近視是角膜或眼球內水品體之屈折力比普通眼較强，　性近視是角膜及水晶體等之屈折力沒有變化，且眼軸長而網膜比普通眼較向後，即構成球狀的眼球，前後廷長成爲　圓形，這差不多是由於遺傳而來的。假性近視，是普通眼長期閱覽細小的東西，眼睛調節機能的緊張狀態，成爲習慣。那末它的原因究竟是什麽？最一般地來　，近視的原　可以　是『由於看近的東西』。　如讀書，　　等近距離工作成爲習慣時，就是近視的原因。</p>
<p>伹在同一學校，以間樣程度用功，反而有成爲近視　奢有不成爲近視眼者，其故安在？這是眼的　　，即體　有很大開係。例如體　盧　者往往成爲近視，問時對於『眼睛』的　生知　缺換言之，都是以　性近視爲其研究對象。於是這種直接輸入來的眼科　學，不僅一向不能治近視，反而使其增加。</p>
<p>因此便想　日本的近視決不都是　傳來的，一定有其他原因在，努力研究的結果，終於打破這　　。這就是在日本所稱爲近視的，遺傳之軸性近視少，而假性近視却佔其中全體之一半，再欠，也會成爲原因。那未在全世界各民族當中，爲什麽日本人近視眼最多呢？對於這一問題，在眼科醫學領域內一向都忽視日本人近視的特殊條件，而根據西歐輸入的眼科醫學，當作一般的近視來判斷。</p>
<p>西歐眼科醫學所討論的近視，差不多都是遺傳來的近視眼，次就是屈折近視。於是以前日本只要認爲是近視，就　他戴上一副眼鏡，這種治療法決不適合於遺傳軸性近視以外的近視，後來才這樣明白了。所以因爲這種不妥當的治療法，日本的近視病不僅沒能撲滅，反而日漸增多。</p>
<p>那末日本未來的主人公靑少年當中，究究有多少近視病患者　？暫且先看一下近視最多的學生。民國二十四年，文部省響應各處帝國大學而在東京，京都，大阪，福　，千葉，石川等六縣，實行二萬七千名學生的近視眼網査，結果：小學生男二五。四三，小學生女二八，五〇，中學四入·二三，高等女校四四·四七，高等學校六七·〇三。再看一下由民國二年至民國二十四年間的學生近視增加率。</p>
<p>中學一六％－三一％，高等女校一〇％－三〇％，高等學校四二％－五二％，帝大四六％－五七％。這就是說中學增加了一倍，高等女校增加了三倍，這種增加率眞是令人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>但如上述，其中假性近視佔全部之一半，而屈折近視又佔其餘之大部分。</p>
<p>那宋對於西歐人描寫日本人面孔時必須架以眼鏡的這種近視，究竟怎樣治療呢？換言之，怎樣可以把這副不名譽的眼鏡摘下來呢？上面已經講過，軸性近視完全是由遺傳而來，在目前還沒有發現治療的方法，然而假性近視與屈折近視如能按下述方法實行，一定可以全瘉，同時也能預防尚未近視的普通眼。</p>
<p>（一）使身體強健預防近視。</p>
<p>（二）勿過度操勞目力。</p>
<p>（三）訊書時須保持板正之姿勢，例如橫臥　書，或床上讀書，這都應禁止。讀書時要規矩地面對桌子，眼與桌面距離須在三十生的以上。</p>
<p>（四）注意適當地吸收光綫。</p>
<p>（五）選擇印刷品。</p>
<p>最後一個便是從朱有人說過的完全近視治療法，不要戴精確的眼睛，即是說，近視者不戴眼晴反要好些，決不至增加度數，買際理論吿訢我們，最好盡量不戴眼鏡，且在讀書或其他微細作業時，必須把眼鏡摘下來。同時要常常努力遙望遠處。這樣就會充分預防近視，且有益淤治療近視，在最近的將來，我希望在日本不再存在遺傳以外的近視，我們都要成爲「不戴眼鏡的日本人。（　：自束京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>泰陸軍參謀次長返國　發表視察昭南印象　敬佩日本技術之優秀性能</h3>
<p>盤谷十二日中央社電泰國陸軍參謀决長喬狄克薩德少將，前自此間隨中滿泰三國駐日武官南方視察團一行，赴爪哇蘇門答臘各地視察，歷時兩週，巳於八日返抵此間。氏特於昨十一日發表此行感想如决，吾等在昭南時，蒙當地軍當局詳爲說明南方佔領地之一般情况，對於一切均得徹底明瞭。當視察婆羅洲布奇特馬及其他等處之戰跡，聞當時戰鬥之熾烈，與日軍奪勇之情形均呈現於眼前。昭南塞萊塔軍港，以及昭南市內亦均詳爲視察。戰後僅一年有半，其復興之迅速，實出人之意料。余於戰前亦會親蒞昭南，蘇門答臘，爪哇等處，但昭南目前之情况，似較戰前尤爲繁榮，深感該地已爲日軍佔領地之中心區。又棉蘭之港灣設施等亦均修葺完善，於此會聆當地人說明昔日日軍落下傘部隊奮戰之情况，此外精油廠等已完全恢復，且較戰前較爲優良，使吾等對日本技術之優秀性能，殊爲敬佩。爪哇地方之原住民，對日軍已深俱信心，故該地已成爲明朗之地區，余於十四年前，曾以訪日軍事視察團之一員，赴日訪問，得視察陣軍演習進各軍港，是時即已深感日軍之英勇不凡，而此次視察後，更獲知日軍不僅戰鬥英勇，而對於建設亦迅速非凡，故允感日軍以及日人之精神偉大。又佔領區之各地住民，亦已脫離戰前時所受英美荷等國之影響，從事培養大東亞人共有之美德，復由於日軍當局之善導，均積極從事建設之工作云。</p>
<h3>日泰通訉協定　舉行簽字典禮</h3>
<p>盤谷十二日中央社電　日泰通訊協定簽字典禮，今日已在此間中央郵政局舉行，出席日本方面總領事及大使館橫田書記官，泰國方面交通部通信局關係長官多人。簽字典禮終了後，日泰雙方並發表共同聲明如决，日本政府爲改善日泰間通訊，前會與泰國政府交涉關於泰國與中日滿間開始　文電報及使羅馬字電報制度簡易化，以及泰國與日本南方佔領地間開始日文電報等事，最近雙方意見已趨一致，乃訂立通訊協定，並於本月十二日，在盤谷由日本遞信省外據課長與泰國交通部通信局副局長間正式簽字。</p>
<p>盤谷十三日中央社電　日泰通報的定，今日已在此間簽字，經積極整備後，即將於最近實施。盤谷與中日滿間從來僅辦理羅馬宇電報，今此的定成立後，即可辦理日文電報矣。又盤谷與南方日軍佔領各地間，自開戰以來，通訊即行杜絕，今後亦即恢復。按外國通訊局辦理日文電報，此次尚爲首次，此的定成立後，日泰兩國關係將更趨緊密而大東亞共榮圈之紐帶，亦更强化矣。故於政治經濟及文化各方面，均有莫大意義。</p>
<h3>菲志士指示　菲島獨立途徑</h3>
<p>馬尼拉十二日中央社電　菲島革命志士阿基那爾德將軍，於十二日在老兵會大會席上發表演講，指出菲島人民爲完成獨立建設新菲島應行之途徑，滿塲聽衆，極爲感動，其大意謂，「日東條首相前在日本發表之聲明中及最近蒞菲所發表之演說中，均允許菲島獨立，故吾人待望已久之獨立，近將見諸實現，吾親愛之戰友，今日我祖國，因日本之同情與協力，已行將獨立，諒諸先烈亦可瞑目，抑我東亞人之處美國覊絆之下，今藉日本之力而獲得解放，實爲上蒼之意志。日本作戰之目的，在驅出支配東亞之英美荷勢力，並建設共存共榮之東亞，故凡我東亞人對於日本此種最高之目的，無不深爲贊同，故諸君應即與日本共同蹶起。須知時至今日，舊的歷史業已結束，新的勝史正在展開，我菲島一千八百萬人民，均應團結一致，與東亞先進之國家日本共享獨立共榮之樂云。）</p>

<h3>中日經濟協力之途（四）</h3>
<p>加速完成戰時體制不負友邦熱烈期待　陳維廉</p>
<p>現在中國正進入一個偉大的時代，淸未民初以來，孫文先生及多數革命先烈，流了幾許寶貴的鮮血，經過多决的激鬬，爲的是：打倒帝國主義，撒廢治外法權，此囘租界。今因友邦日本發動大東亞戰爭，更站在愛東亞的至誠立塲，而毅然實行對華新方針，於是這些偉大事業，得告逐一完成。對華新方針，可以說是近衛原則的進一步表示，也就是大東亞戰爭之必然的發展，這確是在中日關係上劃一新階段的重大事件。中國革命的對外問題，即民族主義的願望，至此已根本達到，我們中國同胞應該虛心坦懷，以十二分的誠摯來接受它，　而如此，則應付新中日關係的中國之途徑，必自然展開。</p>
<p>中國多年企望的國家獨立，民族解放，現在已經達到，今後的課題，常然是國內問題。對外問題有待於今後處理者尚多，但是等到國內體制强盛，一切自能迎刃而解。</p>
<p>然則現在國內問題的中心任務是什麼呢？不用說得就在於國內戰時體制的完整，這有三種目的：</p>
<p>（一）動員庭業上的民族資本。</p>
<p>（二）抑制流動　部份的投機操縱。</p>
<p>（三）增强農業生產力。</p>
<p>現在凡是到中國來的友邦人士，第一個喫驚的，就是物價的高騰。比中國事變之前，不知高出多少倍，就和去年來此，有許多東西也漲了五倍之多，可證物價狂漲和物資不足的事實？要再是走錯了應付現狀的途徑，民衆更將苦不勝言了，結果對於新政府恐將不滿，進而懷疑到日本對華政策的眞意。不特此也，恐怕物價太高，物資不足，食糧不足後，更將難以獲得勞力。幼稚的中國工業，距離機械化尚遠，大多還是要靠人力的，假使難以獲得勞力，勢必影響到增加生產，還談得到造成高度工業國嗎？間接的又影響了增加對日出口與建設新產業，欲求解決此項威脅與困難，那末唯有先把上述三項問題予以解決，捨此以外，實無他途循可。</p>
<p>應急的措置，就是加强流動部份的統制，從速擴大抑平物價最有效的配給制，在根本上謀取工業及農業增加生產，將流通機構加以合理化的再組轍。爲什麽要這樣做呢？中國是大家知這工業落後的國家，農業占了經濟的中心，農業雖可說是中國經濟的大宗、可是規模也不見得十分宏大，還脫不了原始式的農業狀態，中國雖是農業國，而食糧並不能自給自足，所以與第三國貿易社絕後，再加上日滿兩國所來的物資都有限制，於是今日物資頓吿不足，概而言之，有通貨膨脹的現象，直接的就造成了食糧危機，其中因爲商業主義的習俗已深，流通部份的無政府狀態，害他們不知反省，弄得難以統制，成了投機跋扈的絕　機會激成物價扶搖直上。</p>
<p>然則解決問題的關鍵是什麽呢？這就是要革新工業，農業及流通三方而，流　部份的投機操縱，目前顯然雖於抑制，向和政治疏遠的農業問題，要加以改善，也不是容易的，增强農業生產力，須要技術上予以改良，同時安定農民生活，使其有經濟上的餘力來改善技術，安定農民生活一邊要指導獎勵農民副業，同時根本上問題，還是要减輕農民的還租率，調整琅利負債中國農村還租之大，利息之高，是著名的事實，曾有幾多的學者，專家說這是阻碍農業發展的重要因素，可是你要實行調整還租與利息或使其合理化，就和支　中國農村的業主，以及重利盤剝階級抵觸，馬上會這到他們的反對，新政府能否排除此項阻力，剷除禍根，就可以斷定問題的能否革新，政治要做到大衆化，是農民，勞工，小市民大衆的政治，不能成了買辦，財主，軍閥，奸商的政治。</p>
<p>我以爲社會要調和後再設法發展，這樣才會久長。激起階級鬥爭，推動階級鬥爭後造成的社會發展，不會久長的，階級間的鬥爭，實在是社會弊病的暴露，不能以爲自身有什麽進步的意義，所以業主對佃戶，重利盤剝者對負俊者的問題，這種雙方問的利害，國家能夠予以調整，相信其對於社會的合理發　，必有　獻，假使激成兩者對立，用鬥爭方式來解決，這決不會造成社會的發展也。</p>
<p>今日的中國政治，還有許多急切而重大的問題沒有解決，我們要爭取中華民族生存而能確實表現出朝氣蓬勃的政冶，中華民族今日有爭取生存的氣魄，但看從淸末民初到北伐時期的中國大革命，就證明了中華民族有志於爭取生存。這一次的事變，它的本質已經明瞭，發覺自己的誤會，現在搖身一變，以嶄新的姿態到和平陣容中活躍，中國事變，造成了日本方面在政治，經濟，思想上的大革新，同樣也掃除了中國方面像事變當初那樣的抗日民族意識。</p>
<p>我深望在主席及執政諸公，抱着這樣的自覺，認定了今日中國的應有姿態，速向新途徑勇往邁進，同時相信友邦日本以及目下在解放途上的全東亞民族，亦必寄予同情，不惜支援。（雲鷗：譯自六月五日每日新聞）（完）</p>

<h3>米沃可展開白刄戰　德軍突破蘇軍陣地　又方爭奪制空權之空戰極爲激烈　此舉認爲德國發動夏委攻勢先奏</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　蘇軍爲謀確保高加索西北重鎭級斯多夫起見，十一日復於米沃斯河中流馬特威夫庫爾康地區，展開大規校攻勢，兩軍於德軍陳地正面展開壯烈白刃戰，經德軍猛烈反擊後，未幾蘇軍即遭重創潰退，德軍乘勝追擊，且似已突破蘇眾主力陣地。蘇情報局十一日夜發表公報，對此亦行承認，謂德軍於十一日出動坦克車數百輛，及大批飛機，猛攻蘇軍陣地，曾一度爲其突破云。同時德蘇兩軍爭奪制空權之空戰，仍極激烈，蘇聯曁英美兩國，咸認此爲德軍將展開夏季決戰之先奏曲，故頗感不安。路透社駐莫斯科訪員於十一日，曾就蘇空軍已坐失良機論稱，目前東綫戰爭之重點，仍以空襲戰爲戰略中心，　料最近之將來，空戰必更趨激烈。德空軍於過去八日間，曾猛炸蘇聯之高爾基，伏爾霍夫及亞羅斯拉夫三大工業要地，而蘇夜問轟炸機隊刻則變更戰法，專事集中，轟炸德軍機塲云。德軍事評論家狄德雅里爾中將，亦於十一日夜在柏林廣播稱，德軍展開夏季攻勢，爲期巳迫，東綫德軍之配備狀况，目前對於凖備展開攻勢作戰，已獲良好立足點，此實暗示目前戰局之動向云。</p>
<h3>義方公佈　班泰勒里亞戰況　守軍英雄搞戰成爲美談</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　海通社訊，英方傳已佔領班泰勒里亞，德國車事方面昨晚對此說，尚未加以評論，據云現時尚未接獲消息。</p>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社訊　今日政府所發之義戰時公報，正式證實班泰雷里亞島義守軍，已降於反軸心軍。按班島面積爲三〇方里，位於北非海岸及西西島間之海峽內，公報續稱，反軸心軍現正集中戰力襲擊蘭貝杜薩島，該島位於班島東南八〇里，處於馬爾太及突尼西亞之間，並言該島義守軍，已拒絕投降敵方之請求。</p>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社電　海通社訊班泰勒里亞守軍之英勇抗戰，昨日在此間已成爲談論之主要題材，關於所傳該島業已陷落之消息，至星期五晚，此間尚未證實，官方宣吿謂，並未知悉該島之失陷，因此羅馬人士，相信該島之守軍，在英勇之卡狄萊司令官領導下，仍繼續奮男抗戰，地中海德空軍機關報，在星期六曾刊載守軍英勇抗戰之情形，亦指出在過去數日間，該島每日皆遭十二次白畫空襲。義大利日報佔計在星期四脅有反軸心飛機一千架，　擊該島，反軸心轟炸機分批來襲，於十一小時之內，　擊二十七次，在星期四以一千架轟炸機，作大規模襲擊之前，曾另有一次以轟炸機五百架襲擊。羅馬之軍事觀察家，現並密切注意蘭貝杜薩島之局勢，該島之防務不及班泰勒里亞堅强，比較易於攻擊。義大利日報，指出該島面積僅的二十萬公里，該島駐軍最近曾消減冀圖登陸之反軸心軍精銳五中隊之衆。</p>
<h3>特戈爾與委勞間　僵仍未解決</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　法國國民解放委員曾會議中之僵局，至昨日仍未解決，但路透社駐阿雨及爾特派記者則謂，法叛逆陣營中之最近危機，經昨晨之非正式談話後，至下午已有好轉。該記者謂，巳證實特戈爾曾提出辭去委員會共同主席之職務，但其同事則一致加以挽留。昨晨曾有兩次非正式會議，一次係由季勞及除特戈爾以外之其他各委員舉行，另一次則係由特戈爾季勞卡特魯及費立浦四人舉行。但委員會之會期，則尚未定，在週末問，似不致舉行，但在未來之兩三日間，似將由雙方交換解決僵局之方式，賈德魯及委員中之非軍人委員，現正從事起草一方式，其解決之方法，大致或將使季勞任法叛軍司令之職，而使特戈爾負改組軍隊之責，此爲特戈爾所堅持者，蓋特氏以爲渠在戰前，曾遭斯人之阻撓，現亦係受斯人之阻撓，據海通社訊特戈爾之以辭職寫要挾，僅能解爲係企圖以壓力加諸季勞及委員會。該社之丹古爾消息稱，特戈爾絕無放棄其在北非之有樣力地位之意，特氏自持其對於軍事問題，有所　述，且素負摩托化戰爭專家之譽，故希望能貫澈共改組北非法叛軍之主張，因此委員會之要求季特二氏分別提出彼等之主張，實係對季勞之圈套，阿爾及利亞之報紙，已奉當局訓令，對於季特間之新爭執，不許道及隻字。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　英美兩國宣傳機關，自此次羅邱於華盛頓會談後，即盛傳反軸心軍將進攻歐洲，但因客觀條件，殊多困難，故果吾能够實現，實成問題。茲瑞典每日新聞駐柏林訪員詳述反軸心軍實不能進攻歐陸，如若强行展開西歐登陸作戰，亦必將喪失百萬大軍，得不補失。該訪員詳述謂，反軸心軍於實行登陸作戰時，將以每五萬人爲一組，由多數驅逐艦護衛，乘輸送船駛向目的地，其時首必以戰門艦及巡洋艦　　海岸地帶，並須出動空軍，轟炸德軍防綫，以資掩護登陸部隊，後將以每一百二十人爲一隊，分乘鋼製登陸小艇，實行登陸作戰，繼將小型坦克車運上陸地，但此時德軍方面，必立即出動潛艇，襲擊反軸心軍之艦隊及輸送船隊，因此登陸部隊，至少必有半數，因而葬身海底。同時德空軍亦必參加作戰，德陸上部隊亦必以機構與迫撃砲猛射登陸部隊，因此反軸心軍所遭受之損害，必更形增大。假設反軸心軍於遭受重創登陸成功，而確保立足點時，則其分布於百公里乃至一百五十公里之正面陣地之五萬人力，最多僅可剩餘一萬二三千人。據德軍預測，反軸心軍橫渡多維爾海峽爲其全兵力中能有百分之廿三得以登陸，即可視謂最大成功，而其繼續登陸之部隊，亦仍將喪失半數。假設此項登隨部隊，縱可漸次向內陸推進八公里乃至十公里，但仍不能睥睨德軍要塞綫，但德軍於其登陸之第三日，必將實行猛烈反攻，其時反軸心軍亦必逐漸運到火批軍火，努力抵抗，而展開激烈之攻防戰，又據德軍推測　假設反軸心軍登陸部隊，十五萬人中於海邊及登陸後陣亡穴萬五千人，復有受傷及失踪者三萬人，則所餘之五萬五千人，大約僅可推進二十公里而已，因而其時僅此五萬五千人，實不足抵抗德軍之眞正攻勢，如反軸心軍登陸作戰所受之損害，一如上述，則其於一地區之登陸兵力，不下萬人，決不敷分配，至少必需裝備優秀之精銳部隊一百五十萬人，但此次戰爭中運輸軍隊一人，必須船舶十三噸，因此宣稱展開登陸作戰雖易，但船舶問題實至困難，故反軸心軍之欲於最近展開歐洲登陸作戰，恐終不可能也。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦中立國方　息，英國公衆信反軸心國進攻歐洲不出十日之外，六月廿二曰爲德法停戰紀念日，反軸心國將利用該日，爲進攻歐洲之吉日，官方雖稱進攻歐洲不能注目於特殊之一日，惟英國報界與半官方面公開宣佈，反軸心國將於月內進攻歐洲云</p>

<h3>德蘇決戰前夕　蘇聯戰鬥力全貌（一）</h3>
<p>一　四月之久，　許多惡劣條件而激烈地展開的德蘇冬季攻防戰，隨着春季的降臨而漸趨消沉、現在除戰綫的各地有零星的局部戰以外，幾無值得記載的戰事。</p>
<p>何人不能否認，德蘇戰的本質，經此次冬季作戰後，完全顯呈着長期消耗戰的姿態了。在去年夏季，因德軍之可驚的進攻而大感狼狽的英美反軸心陣營之一部，鑒於紅軍的相繼敗北，預料紅軍單獨抗戰力將全面的崩潰、推斷紅軍在此次冬季戰中不能發揮似第一次冬李攻勢巾所表現的戰力，這種極悲觀的見解漸見抬頭。持看這種見解的代表者，如如名的紐約泰晤士報軍事記者漢森鮑爾溫，即如親蘇派的軍事尃門家馬克思惠納，也似多少傾向於這種見解。</p>
<p>因而紅軍在此次冬　戰中所表現的戰力，在他們以爲是「意外」。但如其把去年夏季作戰中的戰局，不當牠是個別的現象，而全體地把握起來，就不一定是意外了。</p>
<p>德蘇戰不用說得是動盪不定而分不出高下的戰爭。德軍如取夏季攻勞、紅軍則答以冬季反攻，今日之前，像時鐘一樣準確地反復着，但在今後仍將重演，所以德蘇二軍的作戰計劃，亦自依此綫而擬訂。</p>
<p>德蘇戰的現階段，相當於從「冬季陣」移向「夏季陣」的過渡期，德蘇兩軍在冬季戰中同樣消耗了相當的戰力，因而在兵力的的補充上，兵站綫的整頓上，兵器的積蓄及其他種種工作上，尚須相當的時日，所以德軍的夏季攻勢之開始，不會比去年的來得早。而德軍開始夏季攻勢的時期，也就是評估德軍戰力的有力材料。</p>
<p>德軍除東部戰綫以外，固尚有突尼西亞戰綫，但後者的戰綫現正在重大的轉變期中，似已過去，故僅以東部戰綫來評論德蘇兩軍的戰力，那果錯誤的、我們在此地來檢討對應於未來夏季戰的蘇聯的抗戰力，以爲夏季戰中判斷戰局的資料，未必是不必要的。</p>
<p>評估蘇聯抗戰力的塲合，不用說，自應從德蘇戰之基本性格的長期消耗戰的觀點出發。一般地在評佔一國戰力的塲合，似多以人的物的資源之多寡，戰時經濟及政治體制之强弱，輸送力的問題，前綫後方的士氣等諸點爲對象，筆者自亦不能例外，以此爲檢討蘇聯抗戰力的根據。</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論</p>
<h3>利用游資開辦工廠</h3>
<p>游資之正當出路，厥爲從事生產，目下生產事業之最有利於國計民生者，無過於從事工業，值此世界戰爭彌漫各國，凡民生日用之所需，決不能仰給於舶來，勢非自行製造不可。以中國物產之豐，原料之富，倘有優良之設備，專門之技術人才，則凡衣食住行之用途，何一不可自給自足？在個人則獲利最感安全，在國家社會則貢獻最巨，於公於私，均有　大之裨益。擁有游資者，苟以資金設廠開工，不但爲百年不拔之基，且安全穩妥無有逾於此者。同時企業家創設企業公司，固爲目前切要之圖。顧經營企業之最有希望最足爲社會重視者，亦無有逾於設立工廠；較諸囤積貨物，或販賣地產等業務，其利人利已之區分，不待智者而自辦矣。惟金融界爲工業之後盾；工業界之資金，全恃銀行錢莊爲之供應，今後金融家，應念工業之投資放款爲最安全穩妥之途，一致用全力扶助煦值，俾工業家得以安心改進技術，精研出品，不致分心於資金籌畫，奔走不　，此則金融家應有之責任。</p>
<h3>財部決定　調整中實等四行　官股由中儲銀行接辦</h3>
<p>財政部爲加强金融機構，對官商合辦之中國通商，四明，中國實業，國貨等四銀行決予調整後，上海社記者昨特往訪銀行公會林秘書長，據談調整該四行機構，政府業已決定原則，即將命令公佈。該四銀行以前之官股股本，此後由中儲接辦。董事長由財部指定之，官股董監由政府指派，商股董監由商股各股東選定之。將來在中儲領導下營業，以發展全國農工商業爲宗旨，關於整理各小銀行問題政府並未頒佈辦法，惟各小銀行爲健全組織，均已自動增資云。</p>
<h3>粉麥專委會　限期蒐買小麥</h3>
<p>全國商統會粉麥專委會自經正式成立以來，即經積極進行小麥收買與配給之運銷價格等整個計劃，爲加强蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩特別市各重要產地區之小麥收買及製造工作起見，特在上海蘇州無錫常州鎭江南京蕪湖泰縣蚌埠等九區設立分支辦事處，茲悉該會現以新小麥將於本月廿日左右登塲，特督促各地辦事處限於本月十五日前一律籌設成立，以便開始收買小麥。聞該會主任委員孫仲立特於日前召集各地分支辦事處主任開談話會，除指示積極辦理，（一）各地區屬之麵粉製造商小麥委託商販賣商及麥行登記手續，（二）對當地麵麥產銷詳細情形限期書面報告，（三）與各地主管官署聯絡，並詳述本會任務，請其加以恊助外，特闡明委員會之任務與關係。茲將各地辦事處正副主任名單錄下。計上海辦事處主任粉麩科曹科長兼，副主任林二三，蘇州宋森千·古野等，無錫楊樂山·小泉直二，常州袁志明·古市濃，鎭江嚴仲和·丸岡三郞暫代，南京王紀蒲·北山格司，蕪湖章伯熙·望月佳郞暫代，泰縣張鳳笙·廣瀨淸太郞，蚌埠石德臣·籐義一暫代</p>
<h3>高島總裁談　發展華中經濟方針</h3>
<p>華中振興公司高島植塲正副總裁爲所屬各公司調整問題以及其他事項，曾於上月十一日離滬返國，與關係方面有所接洽，於昨（十一）日乘飛機返滬，據談：在園內曾迭與靑木大東亞大臣，谷大使以及其他關係方面就華中各種經濟問題進行懇談，目下華中方面所最爲必要者，即係經濟之復興，振興公司以及所屬各公司今後俱當根據此項方針推進事業，然爲適應日本之對華新政策，今後應極力使由中國振興中國經濟，各公司之調整問題，亦擬依照此項方針，參酌現實情勢，順次解決。振興公司對於戰時下重要物資之增產，將會同所屬各公司格外努力促進固不待言。今後如有必要且將投資或放款於一般中日合辦公司，以謀華中經濟之發展云。又高島植塲兩總裁豫定於十四日赴京，與國府及日方當局就調整問題進行協議後，約二十左右返滬，然後與各公司接洽後定二十五日再度返日，以便參加二十九日在東京舉行之振興公司股東會。</p>
<h3>物資調查會　定十九日成立</h3>
<p>國府當局爲澈查上海中外商民囤積主要商品投機居奇，抑止物價，安定民生起見，經最高國防會議通過在上海設立之物資調查委員會，選定中日雙方委員十六人已在積極連絡籌備組織中，前傳該委員會定本月十四日舉行首次成立會議，據悉因籌備不及，將預定於本月十九日始可召開成立會議，至對於調查工作，目前仍在嚴密進行中。</p>
<h3>周糧次長　談糧食問題</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　中央社記者爲明瞭最近糧食問題，特走謁糧食部次長周乃文氏，叩詢一般施策，承周氏接見，即席談及糧食問題。周次長謂：「戰時下之糧食問題，不僅關係民生，其施政得失亦足影響國策，良以糧食問題，實爲經濟產業之主要部門，我國於戰前原無所謂統制政策，戰後因事實上需要，乃由政府採取統制方策。糧委會改組糧食部後，對糧食之管理採銷，已樹立具體計劃，雖因種種原因，糧價尚未抑抵，然幸能疏通來源，增加生產，故食糧亦均能維持。本年華北災歉，更須運糧救濟，且今正在謀下層機構之設立調整，俾收買配給更能合理」。周次長繼又就記者所提出首都食糧問題，說明謂：「首都公縣事務，因本部與市當局通力合作，各調查機關亦均能盡職調查，過去情形，尙屬良好。至於公　米價問題，目下首都食米，公定價格，較其他各埠獨爲低廉，原期維持原價，祇以近來各產地存底枯竭，價格飛漲，各項費用有增無已，若不再予調整，勢必影響收買來源，妨碍整個糧政。爰於本月酌加米價至四百四十四元，但較之本部收買成本，每石尙虧損百元以上，與各地米價相較猶爲最低。</p>
<h3>中儲農產貸金　取票據重貼現制</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行將以商業票據重貼現之形式，實施農貸，先以貸放小麥收買資金開始。他如棉花雜糧等收買資金之調度，亦將採用此種制度，實施方法，由收買商人開發票據，向指定華商銀行請示貼現，然後由華商銀行再將該票據持向中央儲備銀行請求重貼現。</p>
<p>小麥貸款業經商定</p>
<p>關於小麥收買貸款，因小麥登塲時期已屆，華方收買商所需之資金，亟須由中儲供給。惟以銀行貸放形式有所考慮，爰經粉麥專委會與中儲協商結果，以商業票據重貼現之方式出現，至於票據貼現率及票據開發人，尙待決定。</p>
<p>交行積極　辦理農貸</p>
<p>又訊：交通銀行奉令辦理農貸，已於上月五日在行內添設農業經濟處，現鑒於農村需要資金融通，極爲迫切，已派員赴南京蕪湖嘉興東台四區，籌設農業經濟辦事處，限二個月內成立，實施貸放，同時該行農業經濟處，已應無錫蘇北及上海附近農業機關及農商之請，放給棉花·育植·養豬·農藝·製造農具及農田經營等各種貸款，總數一千二百萬元。</p>
<h3>日肥皂業組合成立</h3>
<p>日商華中肥皂同業組合聯合會，業於前（十一）日下午四時假日本俱樂部召開成立會，並選出負責機關如下，（一）理事長日本油脂，（二）　理事長三菱，（三）會計大丸洋行，（四）理事三井出光洋行。該會並將於近日內召集總會，出席之代表則由商統會決定云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股由疲轉趨穩堅，金價及貨物走勢硬化，各方虛軟之人心因之轉定。然晨初之疲小過多，後雖回升，終仍大都軋小。週六交易不旺，新藥業之中法堅挺，新亞仍站關口，信誼藥廠大關朱易堅持，五洲及中西稍昂·百貨業之永安疲後復興，新新與國貨呆定，中國內衣交少價平，景福衫襪略秀·紡織業之永安紗廠略挫，美亞綢廠軋平·文化業一廠不振，商務·中華·世界三書局賣價再見喊低·公用業閘北水電少變化，南洋烟公司成交價突高，大中華火柴平疲。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>公債　統一公債暗市，甲乙丙丁戊五種債票，價格均見低落，惟內種獨升，成交不旺。</p>
<p>金銀　銀樓業首飾金，門市照限價，惟手續費增加，業內外成交價又見盤上，近限價。紋銀掛牌不更，業內外做價隱在關口。</p>
<p>紗布　棉紗因天雨連綿，且爲週末成交閒淡，行情細紗稍堅，交易寥寥無幾。棉布人心挺秀，尙有浮戶收進，各方供意薄弱，市價盤旋。龍頭細布四君子嗶嘰桃花女士林布均見軋升，白貓花布秦良玉漂布價無變化。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>釀造業　本市釀造業同業公會，業經成立開始辦公，對同業會員登記亦經限期辦竣，該會鑒於本市經營酒類之酒菜館亦應加入該會爲會員，以資將來配給營業，惟酒菜館仍未入會似不合法，故巳由該會依據工商組織法令，備文呈請糧食局轉飭酒菜館業公會，知照各酒菜館從速加入該會，否則將來配給事宜實施，對酒菜館不予配給，勢必不得兼營類業務云。</p>
<p>玻璃業　本市玻璃業同業公會業經經濟局指定人選，負責籌備就緒，定期於今（十三）日下午二時假市商會召開成立大會，通過章程及推選理監事云。</p>
<p>茶　業　上海區茶食業同業公會業經糧食局指定黃景崎許榮森李國治等爲籌備員，組織籌備會開始籌備，幷辦理會員登記，至十五日截止，凡上海市區經營茶良同業均須入會云。</p>
<p>粗細顏料業　本市粗細顏料業雜貨公會，自奉令與西顏料業公會合組上海特別市顏料號業同業公會後，以該業與西顏料業性質各異，殊難合併，除已以書面分呈各主管機關請求單獨組織公會，以杜糾紛而利統制外，頃悉該業又將派代表前往請愿云。</p>
<h3>簡訉</h3>
<p>本埠寗波路大公銀行，上月間在法大馬路廿六·廿八號開設法租界分行，頃定於本月十三日星期日上午九時起，舉行甄別會計人員考試，聘定監試人員，鄭重舉辦，將來視成績之優劣，爲調整職位之參考。</p>
<h3>進入新階段之　商統會工作槪觀</h3>
<p>商統會改隸行政院以來，決定在六月十五日以前確立一切下層機構，但相距預定日期已近，刻正趕辦一切未竣事宜，從速成立未組織之聯合會，業已成立之聯合會十六種，尊業委員會之四種，下層機構大體就緒，行將進入具體工作期間，今後之工作勢力必益加其重要性，刻下商統會之工作狀况，大體如次：</p>
<p>（一）已成立與未成立之聯合會</p>
<p>舊糧食部系統關係之六種聯合會，舊實業部系統關係之十六種聯合會，共計廿二種，截至六月七日已成立者有十六種，所餘不過六種，此六種聯合會，預定在本月十五日以前，一律組織成立，旣成立之聯合會有：雜糧業同業聯合會（以下將同業聯合五字略去）麵粉業，畜產業，蛋業，糖業，食油業，皂燭業，火柴業，化學工業，棉織品業，煤業，百貨業，絲綢業，皮革業，酒精業，菸業，共計十六業。未成立之聯合會計有金屬業，毛紡織業，棉花業，玻璃業，橡膠業，電氣業等。至於實業，糧食兩部所決定之廿二種聯合會，大部已由商統會指導成立，成立之後，其重心將置於最重要之商品聯合會，至於組織準備，亦可讓人爲結束。</p>
<p>（二）專業委員會</p>

<h3>Food Supply During the China Famine</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>Introducing an easily cultivated, high-yield, and nutritious food substitute</p>
<p>In last month's 24th issue of the "Weekly Forum," I wrote an article on the prerequisites for famine relief. If we can work diligently according to these principles, the results will be better than simply going through the motions or superficially embellishing things, and we may even achieve some practical gains. However, thinking about the difficulties that inevitably arise after the relief work is completed, we should prepare as early as possible. Historically, after a major disaster, displacement and migration leave most homes empty and the land barren. Even if the weather is favorable the following year, what good will it do? Therefore, attracting back displaced people is the primary virtuous act of local officials. But even if there are people to farm the land, the farming implements will have been scattered and lost due to the escape from the famine, and it will be necessary to find ways to collect and replenish them. Fortunately, if farm tools are not lacking and people are not lazy, what good is it if there are no seeds? The other day, I heard from many people in the north who wrote, "We need seeds for rice, beans, and wheat now, even more urgently than food." This is the reason. However, the sorghum, beans, and wheat in the north are usually sown around May in the lunar calendar, which is impossible this year. We have to wait a year, so how can people survive? I once saw a handwritten document by Mr. Zhu Huai about Baofeng (a plant name). If we can obtain the seeds and quickly send them to the disaster area, then all the difficulties mentioned above can be completely resolved. Now I have found the original manuscript, organized and summarized it, and introduced it to all of you readers. It would be a great blessing if we could all work together to address this issue.</p>
<p>Baofeng originated in South America and was originally called "Pon-feng," translated as Baofeng. Sometimes it is also called Baofen, which is a transliteration. More than a century ago, it was widely planted in Java and is a food plant in the yam family. During the European War, Germany had the richest reserves of it and later relied on it to avoid starvation. It is now said to be the main substitute for food. There are many German expatriates in China; why not inquire in detail with familiar friends?</p>
<p>The ease with which it can be planted and grown is truly unheard of. As long as the soil is fertile and loose, whether it is on hillsides, in mountain valleys, or even at the foot of earthen walls, it will live when planted and grow large. When planting, bury the branches left over from the previous time in the soil, using mud to cover them. The branches will then grow into bulbs in all directions in the dark. Initially, artificial irrigation is required, but once it sprouts, it is unaffected by either floods or droughts. Therefore, no management is required until harvest. Moreover, it can be planted twice a year, in spring (March-April) and autumn (July-August), which are the planting seasons. When planting, cut off the tip of the branch at an angle, leaving eight inches, and insert it into the soil, paying attention to the top and bottom. Do not turn it upside down. After three months (eighty days in Java, one hundred or one hundred and twenty days in Germany), pull it out by hand. If the bulb can be pulled out along with the roots, it is ripe.</p>
<p>The quantity produced is even more surprising. It is harvested twice a year, more in the spring and less in the autumn. Each bulb yields six or seven pounds, and each acre can be planted with four or five hundred branches, yielding at least twenty or thirty "dan" (a unit of weight), totaling sixty "dan" for both harvests, which is equivalent to twenty times the yield of rice and wheat. Dig a two-foot-deep pit in dry land, pile them in it, and cover them with straw or chaff. They can be preserved for more than a year, but after a flood, the skin becomes slippery and shiny, and they cannot be stored for long. It seems somewhat similar to the yams we commonly see, but yams are only harvested once a year, yielding at most twenty "dan" per acre, and are greatly affected by floods and droughts. Moreover, the starch content is too low, only 18% to 20%, and the water content is too high, so they cannot be stored for long. Comparing the two, how can they be spoken of in the same breath?</p>
<p>Its uses are especially broad. In Java, it is used as a common food, and in Germany during wartime, it was also used as a major item for famine relief. In addition, it can be used to make wine and alcohol, or sauces and vinegar, as well as the starch needed in industry and the paste used in textiles. It is considered a treasure not only for famine relief. Now, here is a list of its ingredients:</p>
<p>The various materials above were obtained by Mr. Mi Huai after much effort in research. Mr. Zhu discovered Baofeng a year ago. His motivation was that rice prices were rising higher and higher at that time. He wanted to transplant this high-yield, easy-to-sow crop to replace rice and flour, which has helped us with the important matter of famine relief. If it succeeds, it will indeed be the greatest benefit for the disaster victims. Mr. Zhu said that our friendly neighbor, Japan, is world-renowned for its research and promotion of practical applications, and he believes that Baofeng is definitely being tested there. If they are willing to share some seeds with China and send them to the disaster area before July so that they can be sown, it would truly be the realization of sharing joys and sorrows, and coexisting in prosperity. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food are leading the famine relief efforts in North China, and they are doing their utmost. If they can also implement a permanent plan so that millions of disaster victims can rely on it for generations, this achievement will be forever recorded in history.</p>
<p>Koo Hung-ming, a critic of world civilization produced by modern China, warned in 1901 about the method by which Japan should handle the Chinese problem:</p>
<h3>Words from a True "Japan Expert" and "China Expert"</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tsukasa</p>
<p>"Japan is the last country to grasp the key to solving the Chinese problem. Because the Chinese problem is related to the interests of Japanese national life, Japan has a greater stake in its solution than any other country. Japan's current position is that its military power alone is sufficient to exclude other countries and forcefully implement its own policies toward China. But Japan cannot observe China through foreign-made spectacles just because it can do so. If Japan holds a correct and clear view of the core of the Chinese problem, then Japan may become the 'Mark-graf' guarding the borders of East Asian civilization." (Koo Hung-ming, "The Spirit of the East," p. 77)</p>
<p>He warned Japan, "Do not use foreign-made spectacles to observe China." This statement sounded quite harsh to some Japanese people at the time. Before the Boxer Rebellion, the Japanese respected China as a civilized and advanced country and never looked down on China like the European and American powers. Since the Boxer Rebellion, when Japan joined the ranks of European and American countries, Japan began to develop the habit of observing Chinese people, who are also of the yellow race, through "foreign-made spectacles." Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, this habit has become increasingly entrenched among the Japanese. It sounds unpleasant to Chinese ears, but to Japanese ears, it is like calling Japanese people a humorous name, with some Japanese people thinking that Chinese people are one or two stages behind in terms of cultural development. Some people, like the British "China expert" Arthur Smith, think that Chinese people are a race with the special characteristic of having the so-called "talents of misunderstandings." Some people think that Chinese people have no patriotism or sense of shame, and are just a nation with a highly developed sense of self-interest. Therefore, countless groups of egoists are constantly causing struggles within the country. They believe that for such a nation, it may be a more appropriate political form to divide it rather than unify it.</p>
<p>But in this atmosphere in Japan, one should know that there is also a reform movement budding in China with the same characteristics as the Japanese Meiji Restoration. They argue that cultivating and strengthening this reform movement is the mission of Japan, an advanced country in Asia. They believe that the Republican Revolution is a Chinese patriotic movement that arose during the Japanese Meiji Restoration. Assisting this movement, ensuring China's independence and freedom, and protecting the continent from the invasion of Anglo-American capitalism will also ensure Japan's position as a strong country in the world. They believe that when the liberated Asian continent becomes Japan's backdrop, Japan will be able to gain the strength to eliminate Anglo-American pressure. Therefore, they are quite dissatisfied with Japan's diplomatic policies at the time, which tended to follow Anglo-American policies. In order to break this situation, it is necessary to ensure the success of the Chinese national revolution. Here is a quote from Kita Ikki, one of the "they," which shows how clearly he understood the relationship between the Chinese revolutionary movement and Japan:</p>
<p>"The spirit of Japanese patriotism is gradually revealing a glimmer of dawn in China. When the Japanese spirit of patriotism becomes familiar with their revolutionary party, and they are dealing with Japan in a certain situation, they will actually incite anti-Japanese movements. In fact, at that time, it is a lesson that we should be aware of, to know that they have not understood Japan's true intentions... Japan began to take on the task of teaching young people in neighboring countries ten years ago, without any revolutionary meaning. For the sake of Japan's interests, it also hopes that China can exist as an independent country. However, their young people are sensitive to the honor and disgrace of their country, and they are paying close attention to the gains and losses of their national rights. The hope that Japan can satisfy is not just to be the leader of Asia and act as a teacher? They are tired of hearing those stale theories of friendship, such as being of the same culture and race, and sharing the same fate. They have awakened and believe that Japan wants to treat them with the contemptuous view of those who are accustomed to oppressing the people of a subjugated country. They are full of patriotism, and based on their own reason and hope, they believe that the future of the two countries can only be based on their own rule and Japan's change of attitude, so that friendship can be expected... In short, China is no longer the China of ten years ago. Due to the preconceived notions of ten years ago, the officials and China experts who are contacted only see the surface of China, which is the rotten and decaying class of a subjugated country that can be destroyed by the Wuchang Uprising." (Kita Ikki, "An Unofficial History of the Chinese Revolution," pp. 56, 58)</p>
<p>He observed the Chinese revolution as a rebirth of the Japanese spirit of patriotism in China, and went on to say, "Japan's policy of preserving China is only acting as a dog for Britain's financial annexation of China, and is simply wasting a good intention. (ibid., p. 197)" He exposed the reasons for the anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>Kita Ikki was a close friend of Uchimura Kanzo and a true China expert who directly participated in the practical work of the Chinese revolution. Koo Hung-ming had a Japanese wife and taught at a Japanese school. He was a true Japan expert. In terms of Chinese politics, the former was a revolutionary and the latter was a royalist. Two people with different races and different political views were in complete agreement on Japan's policies toward China. The former said that Japan should "not be a dog for Britain's annexation of China," and the latter said, "Japan should not use foreign-made spectacles to observe China." Although the words are different, the intentions are the same. Both acknowledged China's independence and freedom, and explained that working with a liberated China to resist the United States and Britain was the way to make Japan a leader in Asia and a "frontier defense general."</p>
<p>Now, this view is becoming increasingly powerful in Japan regarding the Chinese problem. The idea of Japan "solving China by force" is definitely not supported by the Japanese people. In terms of concepts, the direction of solving the Chinese problem is completely determined by the direction indicated by this view.</p>
<p>The problem for the future is how Japan will faithfully fulfill the equal relationship between China and Japan guaranteed by the new policy, and how the Chinese will understand Japan's fulfillment. If Japan truly gradually realizes the equal relationship between China and Japan, then the Chinese will also know how to cooperate with Japan's war aims. Therefore, how the emotional opposition between China and Japan since the September 18th Incident is the key to solving the incident depends on what the Chinese see as Japan's true intentions in the current state of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>The Japanese of today are actually true Chinese who inherited the mantle of the Tang Dynasty. Due to the invasion of the Mongols (Yuan Dynasty), the essence of true Chinese civilization since the Tang Dynasty disappeared from the Chinese mainland except for Jiangsu and Zhejiang. That is still preserved as it was in Japan. And Japan is the only powerful country in East Asia that does not allow Westerners to trample on it. So why can't the relationship between Japan and China proceed smoothly? It is just like "brothers fighting over their parents' treasures," and it is also just like the relationship between the British and the French. But China is what the Japanese call the land where beautiful flowers bloom, and Japan is a perfect structure that applies the sharp tools of modern European civilization. Here, we should use the morality of the East to protect this flower and this land. (Koo Hung-ming, "The Great East Asian Culture") (June 11) (Translated by Xiang)</p>

<h3>Official Announcement from the Japanese Foreign Ministry: Recognition of the New Argentine Government; Rumors of Ramírez Forming a New Political Party</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th – Central News Agency: Following Argentina's declaration on the 5th of this month establishing a provisional government with General Ramírez assuming the office of provisional president, Foreign Minister Storni was dispatched on the 8th with official documents to visit Ambassador Afui, the Japanese representative to Argentina, formally notifying him of the provisional government's aims. Concurrently, it was conveyed that the government intends to maintain the traditional friendly relations between Japan and Argentina. The Japanese government, after careful consideration of various aspects, has decided to recognize the new government and instructed Ambassador Tomii on the 11th to relay this intention to the Argentine provisional government. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Foreign Ministry officially announced this at 11:30 AM today.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th – Central News Agency: The German Foreign Ministry revealed yesterday that before recognizing the new Argentine government, Germany had obtained assurances that Argentina would temporarily maintain neutrality. Berlin sources stated that the new Argentine government had notified the German representative that it had assumed power and would temporarily maintain neutrality, a move deemed proper. Germany's policy is to not interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and since former Argentine President Castillo and former Foreign Minister Guinis have returned to the country, Germany has no reason not to recognize the new Argentine government. Berlin sources also stated that the Argentine revolution is clearly about resolving domestic political issues.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: After the formation of the new Argentine cabinet, it immediately clarified Argentina's domestic and foreign policy guidelines. On the 9th, it further announced the implementation of strict control measures over the domestic economy, thus stabilizing public sentiment. The domestic opinion circles unanimously expressed their support for the new government. The main policy direction of the new government domestically is to purify the government and eliminate communism. Several communist leaders have been arrested in Buenos Aires, and corrupt party politics will be reformed. According to Argentine government sources, Argentina will organize a large-scale national party that is integrated with the government to promote its policies. Although General Ramírez has not expressed any intention to organize a new party at present, his attitude towards existing parties is quite indifferent, hence the Radical Party feels largely thwarted by the government's attitude.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Havas report, responsible sources here stated that Rome, upon receiving news of the change of government in Argentina, immediately notified the new Argentine government of Italy's formal recognition. The Italian government also took this opportunity to express its hope that the Ramírez government would fully prioritize the interests of the Argentine people in implementing domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: Yesterday, various countries continued to recognize the Argentine government. According to the list released by the Argentine government, Sweden, Hungary, the Dominican Republic, Bulgaria, and the Polish, Dutch, and Greek governments-in-exile have all recognized the new Argentine government.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Havas correspondent stationed in Buenos Aires, the new Argentine government may organize a large-scale political party to support its policies, but to what extent President Ramírez and his cabinet are paying attention to this plan is still unknown. In any case, the government believes that "internal purification" and the exclusion of certain party leaders are necessary. From some hints, we can assert that the new Argentine government will continue to fight against communism with the utmost determination. It is reported that several prominent leaders of illegal communist movements have been arrested. The situation in Argentina has stabilized, and the more than 6,000 troops who entered Buenos Aires with the new government are scheduled to return to the Campo de Mayo barracks, located fifteen kilometers from Buenos Aires, starting next week, and will hold a review ceremony before their departure to pay respect to President Ramírez and his cabinet. At the same time, the new Argentine government continues to announce new appointments for government restructuring, including the appointment of the original engineer Bartolini as the Minister of Public Works, Dr. Gai Ke Shu as the Foreign Minister, while the Finance Minister remains unchanged. The command headquarters of the army and navy have also been replaced with new people. Rear Admiral Cerro is now solely in charge of naval affairs, and his former position as Naval Commander has been succeeded by Colonel I Yamashi Shisireno. Shi has chosen the battleship Moreno as his flagship, and Colonel Bending has been appointed as Chief of Naval Staff, while Colonel Basriko serves as Secretary-General of the Naval Department. The national merchant fleet will continue to be under the jurisdiction of the Naval Department. Furthermore, the Post and Telegraph Bureau has notified all wireless stations that future propaganda will be limited to the prescribed extent, wireless reporters must use the Spanish language, and strive to avoid the use of local slang.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Scientific Victory (5)</h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of young people in Japan suffering from nearsightedness has been increasing, so much so that foreigners have even coined the phrase, "Those wearing glasses must be Japanese," making Japan the number one nearsighted country in the world. But in today's Greater East Asia War, eyes are also excellent weapons. To achieve victory in the war, we can no longer neglect the increasingly prevalent problem of nearsightedness among young people. What are the causes of nearsightedness? Why is nearsightedness particularly common in Japan? What methods can be used to eradicate and prevent it? These questions should be posed to Dr. Ishihara Shinobu, a renowned authority in the Japanese ophthalmology field, professor emeritus at Tokyo Imperial University, and former principal of Maebashi Medical College, who has published works such as "Eradicating Nearsightedness, Curing Nearsightedness" and "The Problem of Nearsightedness in Japan."</p>
<p>As everyone knows, nearsightedness is when the axial length of the eye is longer than the eye's refractive power, causing parallel light rays to converge in front of the retina, failing to focus a clear image on the back of the eye, making it impossible to see clearly at a distance. From this, we can understand that nearsightedness and farsightedness are not the same thing. Ordinary people think that "nearsightedness" is all the same, but those commonly referred to as nearsightedness, there are also three types: refractive nearsightedness, pseudo-nearsightedness, and axial nearsightedness. Refractive nearsightedness is when the refractive power of the cornea or crystalline lens is stronger than normal eyes; axial nearsightedness is when the refractive power of the cornea and crystalline lens, etc., does not change, but the axial length of the eye is long, and the retina is further back than normal eyes, forming a spherical eyeball that is elongated front and back into an oval shape. This is mostly due to heredity. Pseudo-nearsightedness is when a normal eye is in a state of tension of the eye's adjustment function for a long time due to constantly looking at small things, becoming a habit. So what is the reason for this? Generally speaking, the cause of nearsightedness can be said to be "due to looking at things up close." For example, when activities such as reading and writing, etc., become habits at a close distance, it becomes the cause of nearsightedness.</p>
<p>However, in the same school, with the same degree of effort, some become nearsighted while others do not. Why is that? This has a lot to do with the condition of the eyes and the body. For example, those with weak constitutions often become nearsighted, and at the same time, those who lack knowledge about "eye" health, in other words, are studying refractive nearsightedness. Thus, this kind of directly imported ophthalmology not only has never been able to cure nearsightedness, but has instead increased it.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was thought that nearsightedness in Japan is by no means all hereditary, and there must be other reasons. As a result of diligent research, this assumption was finally broken. That is, in what is called nearsightedness in Japan, there is less hereditary axial nearsightedness, but pseudo-nearsightedness accounts for one-half of the total, in addition to other reasons. So why do Japanese people have the most nearsighted eyes among all ethnic groups in the world? In the field of ophthalmology, the special conditions of Japanese nearsightedness have always been ignored, and judged as general nearsightedness based on Western European ophthalmology.</p>
<p>The nearsightedness discussed in Western European ophthalmology is almost all hereditary nearsightedness, followed by refractive nearsightedness. Therefore, in the past, in Japan, as long as it was considered nearsightedness, they would put a pair of glasses on the patient, and it was later realized that this treatment method was definitely not suitable for nearsightedness other than hereditary axial nearsightedness. Therefore, because of this inappropriate treatment method, nearsightedness in Japan has not only failed to be eradicated, but has instead increased day by day.</p>
<p>So, how many nearsighted patients are there among the young people who will be the future masters of Japan? Let's first look at the students with the most nearsightedness. In 1935, the Ministry of Education responded to the imperial universities in various places and conducted a nearsightedness survey of 27,000 students in six prefectures including Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Chiba, and Ishikawa. The results were: 25.43% for male elementary school students, 28.50% for female elementary school students, 41.23% for middle school students, 44.47% for higher girls' schools, and 67.03% for higher schools. Let's also look at the increase rate of nearsightedness among students from 1913 to 1935.</p>
<p>Middle school 16% - 31%, higher girls' schools 10% - 30%, higher schools 42% - 52%, imperial universities 46% - 57%. This means that middle schools have doubled, higher girls' schools have tripled, and this rate of increase is truly frightening.</p>
<p>But as mentioned above, pseudo-nearsightedness accounts for half of the total, and refractive nearsightedness accounts for most of the rest.</p>
<p>So, how should this nearsightedness, which requires Japanese faces to be framed with glasses, be treated as depicted by Westerners? In other words, how can this dishonorable pair of glasses be taken off? As mentioned above, axial nearsightedness is entirely hereditary, and there is currently no treatment method found. However, if pseudo-nearsightedness and refractive nearsightedness are implemented according to the following methods, they can definitely be completely cured, and at the same time, it can also prevent ordinary eyes that are not yet nearsighted.</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen the body to prevent nearsightedness.</p>
<p>(2) Do not overwork the eyes.</p>
<p>(3) Maintain a proper posture when reading. For example, lying down to read or reading in bed should be prohibited. When reading, face the table properly, and the distance between the eyes and the table must be more than 30 cm.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to proper absorption of light.</p>
<p>(5) Choose printed materials.</p>
<p>The last point is a complete nearsightedness treatment method that someone once said: don't wear accurate glasses, that is, it is better for nearsighted people not to wear glasses, and it will definitely not increase the degree. Practical theory tells us that it is best not to wear glasses as much as possible, and when reading or doing other detailed work, you must take off your glasses. At the same time, always try to look into the distance. This will fully prevent nearsightedness and benefit the treatment of nearsightedness. In the near future, I hope that there will be no nearsightedness other than heredity in Japan, and we will all become "Japanese people who do not wear glasses." (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Thai Army Deputy Chief of Staff Returns Home; Expresses Impressions of His Visit to Shonan, Praising the Excellent Performance of Japanese Technology</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 12th – Central News Agency: Major General Chote Khadikasadri, the Thai Army Deputy Chief of Staff, previously traveled to Java and Sumatra as part of the Thai-Chinese-Japanese military attaché inspection team stationed in Japan. After a two-week visit, he returned here on the 8th. He specially published his impressions of the trip yesterday, the 11th, as follows: When we were in Shonan, the local military authorities provided detailed explanations of the general situation in the occupied territories in the south, and we were able to thoroughly understand everything. When inspecting the battlefields of Bukit Mas in Borneo and other places, the intensity of the battles at that time and the bravery of the Japanese army were presented before our eyes. We also inspected the Seletar Naval Base in Shonan and the city of Shonan in detail. The speed of its recovery after only a year and a half after the war is truly unexpected. I personally visited Shonan, Sumatra, and Java before the war, but the current situation in Shonan seems even more prosperous than before the war. I feel that the area has become the center of the Japanese-occupied territories. Furthermore, the harbor facilities in Medan, etc., have been repaired perfectly. Here, I heard locals explain the valiant battles of the Japanese parachute troops in the past. In addition, oil refineries, etc., have been completely restored and are even better than before the war, which makes us admire the excellent performance of Japanese technology. The indigenous people of Java have deep confidence in the Japanese army, so the area has become a bright area. Fourteen years ago, I visited Japan as a member of a Japanese military inspection team and was able to observe army exercises and various naval ports. At that time, I already deeply felt the extraordinary bravery of the Japanese army. After this inspection, I learned that the Japanese army is not only brave in battle, but also extraordinary in construction. Therefore, I feel that the spirit of the Japanese army and the Japanese people is great. In addition, the residents of the various occupied areas have also broken away from the influence of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands that they were subjected to before the war, and are engaged in cultivating the common virtues of the people of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, thanks to the proper guidance of the Japanese military authorities, they are actively engaged in construction work.</p>
<h3>Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement: Signing Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 12th – Central News Agency: The signing ceremony of the Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement was held today at the Central Post Office here. Representatives from the Japanese side included the Consul-General and Secretary Yokota of the Embassy, ​​and many officials from the Communications Bureau of the Thai Ministry of Transport. After the signing ceremony, Japan and Thailand issued a joint statement as follows: In order to improve communications between Japan and Thailand, the Japanese government previously negotiated with the Thai government regarding the commencement of simplified sentence telegrams and Roman alphabet telegrams between Thailand and Japan, China, and Manchuria, as well as the commencement of Japanese telegrams between Thailand and the Japanese-occupied territories in the south. Recently, both sides have reached a consensus, so a communications agreement was signed, and on the 12th of this month, it was officially signed in Bangkok by the Head of the Overseas Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of Communications and the Deputy Director of the Communications Bureau of the Thai Ministry of Transport.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 13th – Central News Agency: The Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement was signed here today, and after active preparation, it will be implemented soon. Bangkok has only handled Roman alphabet telegrams with Japan, China, and Manchuria. Now that this agreement has been established, Japanese telegrams can also be handled. In addition, communications between Bangkok and the Japanese-occupied areas in the south have been cut off since the start of the war, and will now be restored. This is the first time that a foreign communications bureau will handle Japanese telegrams. After the establishment of this agreement, the relationship between Japan and Thailand will become closer, and the ties of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be further strengthened. Therefore, it has great significance in the political, economic, and cultural fields.</p>
<h3>Instructions from Philippine Patriot: The Path to Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>Manila, 12th – Central News Agency: General Aguinaldo, a Philippine revolutionary patriot, delivered a speech at the veterans' association meeting on the 12th, pointing out the path that the people of the Philippines should take to complete their independence and build a new Philippines. The audience was deeply moved.

Therefore, the independence that we have awaited for a long time will soon be realized. My beloved comrades, today our motherland, thanks to the sympathy and cooperation of Japan, is about to become independent. I believe that the martyrs can also rest in peace. We Asians, who were under the shackles of the United States, are now liberated by the power of Japan, which is the will of Heaven. The purpose of Japan's war is to drive out the British, American, and Dutch forces that dominate East Asia and build an East Asia of co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, all of us East Asians deeply agree with this supreme goal of Japan. Therefore, you should immediately rise up together with Japan. Know that today, the old history has ended, and a new history of victory is unfolding. The 18 million people of my Philippines should unite and share the joy of independence and co-prosperity with Japan, an advanced country in East Asia."</p>
<h3>Burmese and Philippine Dispatch Study Groups to Japan to Observe Local Political Conditions; Both Scheduled to Stay in Japan for Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th – Central News Agency: A Burmese study group arrived in Tokyo at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The Philippine Military Administration has also decided to dispatch a study group to Japan. The group is headed by Manila Mayor Quindecimo and includes 20 members. They are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Turkish Republican People's Party Reaffirms Neutral Policy</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 12th – Central News Agency: According to Havas, the Turkish Republican People's Party is holding its sixth congress in Istanbul. Yesterday, it passed several resolutions, reaffirming that Turkey will abide by the neutral policy pursued by the government. According to the principles of Turkish foreign policy formulated by the Turkish Republican People's Party at its congress in 1931, "The purpose of Turkish policy is to maintain the peace of the country at home and abroad." This congress added a supplementary article, stating, "Turkey must resort to arms only when defending the security and honor of the country." Its meaning clearly reaffirms the defensive nature of Turkish foreign policy. Political figures in Istanbul also attach great importance to the party's neutral resolution. This proves that the party supports the neutral policy strictly adhered to by the Turkish government.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Deeply Feels Operational Difficulties</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Reuters report, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt solemnly pointed out the difficulties in the Pacific region during a radio address to the United States yesterday, stating that the Japanese army, the opponent of the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific, is truly an army that does not fear death. The terrain there is dangerous and the climate is harsh, so the losses of the anti-Axis forces are extremely heavy. For example, the number of soldiers who die from tropical diseases exceeds the number who die in combat by four or five times. Therefore, in total, the number of war-related deaths in New Guinea alone exceeds the number of casualties on the Tunisian front. Furthermore, Australia's manpower mobilization has reached its maximum limit. 68% of men and women aged 14 to 65 have been conscripted or are engaged in war production and other matters directly related to the war.</p>
<h3>Poor Quality and Low Speed of British Ships Built Hastily</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th – Central News Agency: According to Havas, the well-known American financial daily, "The Wall Street Journal," stated that by the end of next year, the total amount of merchant ships in the world owned by the United States will account for 75%, but it admits that the bulk of the new American merchant fleet is made up of hurriedly built and slow-speed Liberty ships. These types of ships cannot be classified as first-class ships. It is also reported that the American shipbuilding tycoon Kaiser may sign a contract with Norwegian shipping companies to supply them with a certain number of Liberty ships. It is said that several oil tankers currently being built in the United States will be handed over to the Norwegian government-in-exile to compensate for the losses of various Norwegian ships serving the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>Chilean Foreign Minister to Visit Washington at US Invitation</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to news from Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Fernandez will not represent President Rios in his visit to the United States, but will travel to Washington at the special invitation of US Secretary of State Hull. The expected departure date will be at the end of June or in mid-July.</p>
<h3>The Path of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (4)</h3>
<p>Accelerate the Completion of the Wartime System to Live Up to the Ardent Expectations of Friendly Nations by Chen Weilian</p>
<p>China is now entering a great era. Since the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, Mr. Sun Wen and many revolutionary martyrs shed much precious blood and went through numerous fierce struggles in order to: overthrow imperialism, abolish extraterritoriality, and recover concessions. Now, because our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, standing on a sincere position of loving East Asia, it resolutely implements a new policy toward China. Thus, these great undertakings are being completed one by one. The new policy toward China can be said to be a further expression of the Konoe Principles, and it is also the inevitable development of the Greater East Asia War. This is indeed a major event that marks a new stage in Sino-Japanese relations. The external problem of the Chinese revolution, that is, the desire for nationalism, has now been fundamentally achieved. We Chinese compatriots should humbly and openly accept it with the utmost sincerity. And in this way, the path of China in response to the new Sino-Japanese relations will naturally unfold.</p>
<p>China's long-cherished national independence and national liberation have now been achieved. The task from now on is naturally a domestic problem. There are still many external problems to be dealt with in the future, but once the domestic system is strong, everything will be solved easily.</p>
<p>So what is the central task of domestic problems now? Needless to say, it lies in the integrity of the domestic wartime system. This has three purposes:</p>
<p>(1) Mobilize national capital in the private sector.</p>
<p>(2) Suppress the mobility of speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>(3) Increase agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing that surprises all the friendly people who come to China is the soaring prices. It is not known how many times higher than before the China Incident. Compared with last year, many things have also increased fivefold, which proves the fact that prices are soaring and materials are insufficient? If we continue to take the wrong approach to dealing with the current situation, the people will suffer even more unspeakable hardships, and as a result, they may become dissatisfied with the new government and even doubt the true intentions of Japan's policy toward China. Not only that, but I am afraid that high prices, insufficient materials, and insufficient food will make it even more difficult to obtain labor. China's nascent industry is far from being mechanized and mostly relies on human labor. If it is difficult to obtain labor, it will inevitably affect the increase in production. How can we talk about creating a highly industrialized country? Indirectly, it also affects the increase in exports to Japan and the construction of new industries. If we want to solve this threat and difficulty, then we can only solve the above three problems first. There is really no other way to follow besides this.</p>
<p>The emergency measures are to strengthen the control of the circulating parts, quickly expand the rationing system, which is the most effective way to suppress and stabilize prices, fundamentally seek to increase industrial and agricultural production, and rationalize the reorganization of the circulation mechanism. Why do we do this? China is a country with backward industry, as everyone knows. Agriculture occupies the center of the economy. Although agriculture can be said to be the bulk of China's economy, its scale is not very large, and it is still stuck in a primitive agricultural state. Although China is an agricultural country, it cannot be self-sufficient in food. Therefore, after trade with third countries is cut off, coupled with the limited materials from Japan and Manchuria, there is a sudden shortage of materials today. Generally speaking, there is a phenomenon of currency inflation, which directly causes a food crisis. Among them, because the customs of commercialism are deeply rooted, the anarchic state of the circulating parts prevents them from reflecting, making it difficult to control, and becoming an excellent opportunity for speculation and recklessness, which stimulates prices to soar.</p>
<p>So what is the key to solving the problem? This is to reform the industrial, agricultural, and circulating parties. Although speculative manipulation of the circulating parts is obviously suppressed at present, it is not easy to improve the agricultural problem, which is alienated from politics. To increase agricultural productivity, technical improvements are needed. At the same time, we must stabilize the lives of farmers and give them economic surplus to improve their technology. While stabilizing the lives of farmers, we must guide and encourage farmers' side businesses. At the same time, the fundamental problem is to reduce the rent rate for farmers and adjust Langli debt. The high rent and high interest rates in Chinese rural areas are well-known facts. Many scholars and experts have said that this is an important factor hindering agricultural development. However, if you want to implement the adjustment of rent and interest or rationalize it, it will conflict with the landlords who support the Chinese countryside and the usury class, and you will immediately encounter their opposition. Whether the new government can eliminate this resistance and eradicate the root of the disaster can determine whether the problem can be reformed. Politics must be popularized, and it must be the politics of the farmers, workers, and petty citizens, and cannot become the politics of compradors, wealthy businessmen, warlords, and treacherous merchants.</p>
<p>I believe that society should be harmonized before trying to develop, so that it will last for a long time. The social development caused by arousing class struggle and promoting class struggle will not last long. The struggle between classes is really an exposure of social ills and cannot be regarded as having any progressive significance in itself. Therefore, the problem between landlords and tenants, and between usurers and debtors, the state can adjust the interests of both parties, and I believe that it will definitely contribute to the rational development of society. If the two sides are aroused to confront each other and use struggle to solve the problem, it will definitely not lead to social development.</p>
<p>Today's Chinese politics still has many urgent and major problems that have not been resolved. We must strive for the survival of the Chinese nation and be able to truly show vigorous political life. The Chinese nation has the spirit of striving for survival today. Looking at the great Chinese revolution from the late Qing Dynasty to the Northern Expedition period, it proves that the Chinese nation is determined to strive for survival. The essence of this incident has become clear. Realizing its own misunderstanding, it is now transforming itself and actively participating in the peace camp with a brand-new attitude. The China Incident has caused major political, economic, and ideological reforms on the Japanese side, and has also eliminated the anti-Japanese national consciousness on the Chinese side like at the beginning of the incident.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that the Chairman and the ruling officials will embrace this awareness, recognize the proper posture of China today, and quickly move forward bravely on a new path. At the same time, I believe that our friendly nation Japan and all the East Asian nations that are currently on the road to liberation will also sympathize and spare no effort to support us.

<h3>White-Blade Battle Unfolds in Miwoke; German Troops Break Through Soviet Positions; Fierce Air Combat for Air Supremacy; This Move Is Considered the Prelude to the German Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – In order to ensure the important town of Krasnodar in the northwest of the Caucasus, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive again on the 11th in the Matveyev Kurgan area in the middle reaches of the Miwos River. The two armies launched a heroic white-blade battle in front of the German positions. After a fierce counterattack by the German army, the Soviet army was soon severely damaged and retreated. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and it seemed that it had broken through the main Soviet positions. The Soviet Intelligence Bureau also admitted this in a public statement issued on the night of the 11th, saying that the German army dispatched hundreds of tanks and a large number of aircraft on the 11th to attack the Soviet positions and once broke through them. At the same time, the air combat between the German and Soviet armies for air supremacy is still extremely fierce. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States all believe that this is the prelude to the German army's summer decisive battle, so they feel quite uneasy. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow said on the 11th that the Soviet air force had missed a good opportunity. At present, the focus of the Eastern Front war is still on air raids as the strategic center. It is expected that air combat will become more intense in the near future. The German air force has bombed the three major industrial areas of Gorky, Volkhov, and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union for the past eight days, while the Soviet night bomber squadrons are now changing their tactics and focusing on bombing German airfields. Lieutenant General Dietrich Riel, a German military commentator, also said in a broadcast in Berlin on the night of the 11th that the German army's summer offensive is imminent. The deployment of the German army on the Eastern Front currently has a good foothold for preparing to launch an offensive operation, which actually implies the direction of the current war situation.</p>
<h3>Italian Side Announces Pantelleria Battle Situation; Heroic Resistance of the Garrison Becomes a Popular Topic</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th – According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, the British side has reported that it has occupied Pantelleria. German military officials did not comment on this last night, saying that they have not yet received news.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 12th – Today's Italian wartime communiqué officially confirmed that the Italian garrison on the island of Pantelleria has surrendered to the anti-Axis forces. According to reports, Pantelleria Island has an area of 30 square miles and is located in the strait between the North African coast and Sicily. The communiqué continued that the anti-Axis forces are now concentrating their forces to attack the island of Lampedusa, which is located 80 miles southeast of Pantelleria, between Malta and Tunisia, and said that the Italian garrison on the island has refused the enemy's request to surrender.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, 12th – Hai Tong News Agency reported that the heroic resistance of the Pantelleria garrison has become the main topic of discussion here yesterday. Regarding the news that the island has already fallen, it has not been confirmed here as of Friday night. Officials announced that they are not aware of the island's fall. Therefore, people in Rome believe that the island's garrison, under the leadership of the heroic Commander Cadilai, is still continuing its manly resistance. The German air force's organ newspaper in the Mediterranean published the situation of the garrison's heroic resistance on Saturday, also pointing out that the island has been subjected to twelve daytime air raids every day for the past few days. Italian daily newspapers estimated that on Thursday, 1,000 anti-Axis aircraft attacked the island. Anti-Axis bombers attacked in batches, attacking 27 times within 11 hours. Before the large-scale attack with 1,000 bombers on Thursday, there was another attack with 500 bombers. Military observers in Rome are now closely watching the situation on the island of Lampedusa, whose defenses are not as strong as Pantelleria and are easier to attack. Italian daily newspapers pointed out that the island has an area of only 200,000 kilometers, and the garrison on the island recently eliminated five elite companies of anti-Axis forces who attempted to land.</p>
<h3>The Stalemate Between De Gaulle and Giraud Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th – The stalemate in the French National Liberation Committee meeting remained unresolved as of yesterday, but a Reuters correspondent stationed in Algiers said that the recent crisis in the French rebel camp has improved by the afternoon after informal talks yesterday morning. The reporter said that it has been confirmed that De Gaulle has offered to resign from the post of co-chairman of the committee, but his colleagues have unanimously retained him. There were two informal meetings yesterday morning, one held by Giraud and other committee members except De Gaulle, and the other held by De Gaulle, Giraud, Catroux, and Philip. However, the meeting date of the committee has not been set, and it does not seem likely to be held during the weekend, but in the next two or three days, the two sides will exchange ways to resolve the stalemate. Jadru and the non-military members of the committee are now drafting a method, and the solution may be to make Giraud the commander of the French rebel army, while making De Gaulle responsible for reorganizing the army, which is what De Gaulle insists on. De Gaulle believes that he was obstructed by this person before the war, and he is also being obstructed by this person now. According to Hai Tong News Agency, De Gaulle's threat to resign can only be interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on Giraud and the committee. The news from Tangul of the agency said that De Gaulle has no intention of giving up his influential position in North Africa. De Gaulle believes that he has some comments on military issues and has always been known as an expert in motorized warfare, so he hopes to implement his proposal to reorganize the North African rebel army. Therefore, the committee's request that Giraud and De Gaulle separately put forward their proposals is actually a trap for Giraud. Newspapers in Algiers have been instructed by the authorities not to mention a word about the new dispute between Giraud and De Gaulle.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Axis Attempt to Attack Europe Is Bound to Face Difficulties; Not Only Is There a Danger of Losing Troops, but Also Transport Ships Are Not Sufficient</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – Since the recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington, the propaganda organs of the United Kingdom and the United States have been spreading rumors that the anti-Axis forces will attack Europe, but due to many objective difficulties, it is questionable whether it can be realized. A correspondent of the Swedish Daily News stationed in Berlin detailed that the anti-Axis forces cannot attack the European continent. If they forcibly launch a landing operation in Western Europe, they will inevitably lose millions of troops and gain more than they lose. The correspondent detailed that when the anti-Axis forces carry out landing operations, they will use 50,000 people as a group, escorted by a large number of destroyers, and sail to the destination by transport ships. At that time, they must first bombard the coastal area with battle cruisers and cruisers, and must dispatch air force to bomb the German defense line to cover the landing troops. Then, they will divide into teams of 120 people and carry out landing operations by steel landing craft, and then transport small tanks to the land. But at this time, the German side will immediately dispatch submarines to attack the anti-Axis fleet and transport fleet. Therefore, at least half of the landing troops will be buried in the seabed. At the same time, the German air force will also participate in the battle, and the German ground forces will also shoot at the landing troops with institutions and mortars. Therefore, the damage suffered by the anti-Axis forces will inevitably increase. Assuming that the anti-Axis forces successfully land after suffering heavy losses and secure a foothold, then the 50,000 people distributed on the front line of 100 kilometers to 150 kilometers can only remain 12,300 people at most. According to German military predictions, the anti-Axis forces can be regarded as the greatest success if 23% of their total force can land across the Dover Strait, and the troops that continue to land will still lose half of them. Assuming that this landing force can gradually advance inland for 8 kilometers to 10 kilometers, it still cannot look down on the German fortress line, but the German army will launch a fierce counterattack on the third day of its landing. At that time, the anti-Axis forces will also gradually transport military supplies and strive to resist, and launch a fierce offensive and defensive war. According to German estimates, assuming that among the 150,000 anti-Axis landing troops, 55,000 people remain after 15,000 people are killed in battle by the sea and after landing, and 30,000 people are injured and missing, then they can only advance about 20 kilometers. Therefore, at that time, only these 55,000 people are not enough to resist the true offensive of the German army. If the damage suffered by the anti-Axis landing operation is as described above, then its landing force in one area is less than 10,000 people, which is definitely not enough to allocate. At least 1.5 million elite troops with excellent equipment are needed, but in this war, 13 tons of ships are required to transport one soldier. Therefore, it is easy to declare the launch of a landing operation, but the ship problem is really difficult. Therefore, it is impossible for the anti-Axis forces to launch a European landing operation in the near future.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, neutral countries in London believe that the anti-Axis countries will attack Europe within ten days. June 22 is the anniversary of the German-French armistice. The anti-Axis countries will use this day as an auspicious day to attack Europe. Although officials said that the attack on Europe cannot be focused on a special day, the British press and semi-official sources openly announced that the anti-Axis countries will attack Europe within this month.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Vichy, 12th – The French government convened a cabinet meeting on the 11th under the chairmanship of President Pétain, and Chief Lidel reported on the general political situation in the country and the situation of French workers in Germany.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the German-Soviet Decisive Battle: A Complete Picture of Soviet Combat Power (1)</h3>
<p>1. The German-Soviet winter offensive and defensive war, which lasted for four months and was fiercely launched under many adverse conditions, gradually subsided with the arrival of spring. Now, except for sporadic local battles in various parts of the front line, there are few battles worth recording.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the nature of the German-Soviet war completely shows a long-term attrition war after this winter operation. Last summer, the part of the Anglo-American anti-Axis camp, which was greatly embarrassed by the German army's amazing offensive, predicted that the Red Army's independent resistance would collapse across the board in view of the Red Army's successive defeats. The pessimistic view that the Red Army could not exert the combat power shown in the first winter offensive in this winter war gradually rose. Representatives who hold this view, such as the famous New York Times military reporter Hanson Baldwin, and even the pro-Soviet military expert Max Werner, seem to be somewhat inclined to this view.</p>
<p>Therefore, the combat power shown by the Red Army in this winter war is, in their opinion, "unexpected." But if we grasp the war situation in last summer's operation as a whole, rather than treating it as an individual phenomenon, it is not necessarily an accident.</p>
<p>The German-Soviet war is, needless to say, a turbulent and indecisive war. The German army takes the summer offensive, and the Red Army answers with the winter counteroffensive. Until today, it has been repeating as accurately as a clock. But it will still be repeated in the future. Therefore, the operational plans of the German and Soviet armies are also drawn up according to this line.</p>
<p>The current stage of the German-Soviet war is equivalent to the transition period from the "winter camp" to the "summer camp." The German and Soviet armies have also consumed considerable combat power in the winter war. Therefore, it still takes considerable time to replenish troops, rectify the supply lines, accumulate weapons, and other tasks. Therefore, the start of the German army's summer offensive will not be earlier than last year. The period when the German army starts its summer offensive is also a powerful material for evaluating the German army's combat power.</p>
<p>In addition to the Eastern Front, the German army also has the Tunisian Front, but the latter's front line is now in a major transition period and seems to have passed. Therefore, it is wrong to only comment on the combat power of the German and Soviet armies based on the Eastern Front. We are here to examine the Soviet Union's resistance force corresponding to the future summer war, and believe that the data for judging the war situation in the summer war may not be unnecessary.</p>
<p>When evaluating the Soviet Union's resistance force, it goes without saying that we should start from the viewpoint of the long-term attrition war, which is the basic character of the German-Soviet war. Generally speaking, when evaluating the combat power of a country, it seems that many people take the amount of human and material resources, the strength of the wartime economic and political system, the problem of transportation capacity, and the morale of the front and rear as objects. The author himself cannot be an exception and takes this as the basis for examining the Soviet Union's resistance force.</p>

<h3>All Future Civilian Food Supplies Will Be Distributed by the Joint Cooperative; The Method of Distributing Grain According to Population Will Continue; The Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association Handed Over Its Responsibilities</h3>
<p>In order to adjust the overall civilian food supply, after implementing unified purchase, centralized distribution, the Ministry of Food, together with the Ministry of Finance, issued food storage coupons, type A 40 million yuan, and type B 10 million yuan, which were undertaken by the Central Reserve Bank to purchase food and build grain storage warehouses. The Rice Grain Purchase and Sales General Management Office was established, and all localities were ordered to establish rice grain joint transportation cooperatives. The rice grain agency has now been transferred. Hereafter, the supply of rice grain will be transferred from the "Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association" to the Rice Grain Joint Cooperative. However, the distribution of grain according to population in the Shanghai urban area will still be entrusted to the Public Works Bureau of the工部局, the Municipal Council, and the Rice Grain Management Bureau to continue. It is heard that the implementation will start on July 1.</p>
<p>The Grain Distribution Method Will Not Be Changed</p>
<p>As for the method of distributing grain according to population, it will not be changed due to its effectiveness since its implementation, and within the possible scope, the amount of household grain in each period will be based on the legitimate needs of the food households. The distribution of rice in Shanghai was originally the military rice and the Ministry of Food's rice grain process, and the affairs of importing southern rice were all handled by the Rice Grain Distribution Association. Hereafter, both foreign rice and local rice will be handled by the Joint Cooperative. The distribution of rice tickets will remain as before. For the Japanese residents, the Rice Grain Distribution Association will exchange foreign rice for local rice from the Joint Cooperative, and then the Association will distribute it.</p>
<p>Most Rice Merchants Applying to Join the Cooperative Are Approved</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Rice Grain Joint Cooperative on June 1, more than 3,500 rice grain retailers, rice milling merchants, and vendors in the jurisdiction have applied to register to join the cooperative. The cooperative is now urgently reviewing the rice merchants who have applied for registration. The reporter of the Shanghai 社 received accurate news yesterday that more than 2,500 have been approved to join the cooperative, and about 100 are unqualified. It is found that the Joint Cooperative stipulates that retail merchants must have a capital of at least 20,000 yuan to join the cooperative, vendors must have a capital of at least 50,000 yuan, and rice milling merchants must have a capital of at least 20,000 yuan. This means that applicants must have official certification documents from the主管機關, otherwise they will be refused to join the cooperative. The application registration has now been closed, but if there are special circumstances, it can be handled later. Hereafter, those who have not joined the cooperative will not be allowed to operate freely.</p>
<p>Excess Broad Beans to Be Recalled by a Deadline</p>
<p>The 32nd period of household grain also includes a kind of mixed broad beans. Now, in view of the fact that there are still many leftover broad beans for sale in various retail rice stores, it is proposed to recall them, entrust the Xin Shu Fa Rice Mill to crush them, and allocate them to the prison as food for prisoners. The date of delivery of the remaining broad beans by each retail rice store will be recorded as follows: (1) Registration number 1 to 284, this month's 14th; (2) Registration number 285 to 546, this month's 16th; (3) Registration number 548 to 091, this month's 18th. All should be sent to the Xin Wei Fa Rice Mill at 896 Chengdu Road within the deadline. The Public Works Bureau will calculate the price at 324 yuan per bag with a total weight of 85 kilograms (all expenses for sending to the 計開 Rice Mill are included). A temporary receipt will be issued when the 麻袋 is returned to the above-mentioned Rice Mill.</p>
<h3>The Zhang Jinhai Case Is Rescheduled for Trial on the 15th</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai's tragic death due to non-criminal reasons, in addition to the French Patrol Chief Millet and Patrol Officer Beckley, the French Consul's Court has already conducted a legal hearing. A number of Chinese suspects, after being summoned twice by the Second Special District Local Court, the entire case has yet to be identified. The current court hearing was originally scheduled to continue on the morning of the 14th of this month. It is now learned that the day coincides with the Feast of Pentecost, so the police authority and the捕房 are closed for holidays as usual. Therefore, it is specially rescheduled to the morning of the 15th at 9 o'clock for a joint trial.</p>
<h3>Responding to the "Convention on Saving Banquets" (Fifth Round)</h3>
<p>(11) Mr. Wang Boyuan (China Reclamation Bank) expressed: Cherishing time and saving banquet expenses are the most important things. I am very willing to participate in the compliance.</p>
<p>(12) Mr. Fan Yangyao (China Industrial Bank) expressed his agreement to participate and supplemented his opinions. In order to save time, effort, and material resources, the following methods may be tried:</p>
<p>(1) Five baskets or four dishes and five 菜 (Chinese food)</p>
<p>(2) One soup, one dish, one snack (Western food)</p>
<p>(3) The 侍滥傾啤湣, soda, regardless of whether the guests need it or not, desperately selling, the host does not stop it, and the guests do not pay attention. This is a waste of materials and money, and selling arrogance is not in line with economic principles and should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Social Welfare Department Telegram Order: Emergency Relief Association to Unify Donations, Donation Registers, Receipts, etc., Must Be Stamped by the Emergency Relief Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the urgent relief matters in North China, Mr. Ding, the Minister of the Social Welfare Department, deeply appreciates the enthusiasm and eagerness of all circles in Shanghai to raise donations, which is highly commendable. However, in order to concentrate efforts and prevent corruption, and to ensure that every penny goes to the public, all donation activities should be unified. Therefore, special regulations have been stipulated, and a telegram has been sent to the North China Emergency Relief Association to handle the matter accordingly. The main points are listed below: (1) Any fundraising activities held by all sectors in the name of North China Emergency Relief, such as plays, performances, broadcasts, and solicitations, must be reported to the North China Emergency Relief Association in advance. (2) All donation registers, receipts, tickets, etc., for fundraising for North China Emergency Relief held by all sectors must be stamped by the Emergency Relief Association. (3) All sectors may refuse to donate to fundraising activities that have not been approved by the Emergency Relief Association or have not been stamped. In order to actively raise a large sum of money, the Emergency Relief Association has also sent a letter to the United Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the letter to various trade associations to solicit donations.</p>
<p>Performance Achievements</p>
<p>Charity Dance Initiated by the Guoqin Ballroom</p>
<p>It was held starting at 8 p.m. the night before. The Emergency Relief Association specially sent Chen to assist in monitoring, and the income reached more than 50,000 yuan. In addition, the Dance Industry Association held a meeting last night to discuss and decided that all dance halls would hold a charity dance for one day, and all income, after deducting expenses, would be used for relief funds.</p>
<p>The Henan Fellowship Association's broadcast of famous actors and opera amateurs was on its second day yesterday, and the results were even better. The current collection of Central Reserve Bank notes is 8,633 yuan, and the amount pledged but not yet collected is 74,271 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Lihua Grand Theater held a daytime performance of "The Canary" by the China Travel Theater Troupe on June 3. The ticket sales for that performance totaled 54,650 yuan. The funds were immediately sent to the Shandong Fellowship Association and the Hebei Fellowship Association to be forwarded to the North China Emergency Relief Association. (The list will be published by the Emergency Relief Association for unification)</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Treasures</p>
<p>This newspaper received a second letter from the owner of Shimo House, Chen</p>
<p>Boheng yesterday, stating: "Due to the drought in North China, I have taken out the original copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, to be sold for charity to help with the relief efforts. Originally, I planned to recover the cost of 20,000 yuan to temporarily maintain my personal life, as I am also a refugee. After reading your newspaper yesterday, I learned that the number of relief funds collected is limited, which is not enough to help. Therefore, I decided to donate the entire proceeds of 50,000 yuan from the charity sale of Lanting to relief efforts, and I will no longer recover the cost, so that the funds obtained will be slightly more and can be of some help to disaster relief."</p>
<p>Donations from Banquets and Receptions, Also Received Letters from Kong Cixuan, Chen Mingshao,</p>
<p>Liu Zigang, stating: "We came to Shanghai from Tianjin this time, and we are deeply grateful for the generous gifts from our friends. We should have returned the favor with banquets, but seeing the severity of the disaster in North China and the urgent need for relief, we plan to hand over 15,000 yuan, which was originally intended for banquets and receptions, to the Hebei Fellowship Association for collection. After deducting 3,000 yuan to subsidize the Fellowship Association's broadcasting and advertising expenses, the remaining funds will be used to help refugees in the disaster area, which will also benefit our friends."</p>

After reading it, we also admire the relics of the sages, and agree with Mr. Wu's meaning regarding the desolation of the tomb and the urgent need for repairs and renovation, and hope that those with literary talent at home and abroad can help achieve this. Therefore, the left text is disclosed, and Mr. Chen Binghe, the president of this newspaper, personally raises 1,000 yuan to advocate for it. According to a rough estimate, the repair of Huang's tomb requires 10,000 yuan. If we can get ten people with literary talent, each contributing 1,000 yuan, we can collect enough funds to complete the task. If you agree, please let us know the amount you are willing to donate and send a letter to the social service department of this newspaper so that we can handle it. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>Record of Visiting the Tomb of Huang Zijiu in Yushan</h3>
<p>— Wu Jianfan</p>
<p>The tomb of Huang Dachi, a Yuan Dynasty recluse, is located at the western foot of Yushan Mountain in Changshu. Ascending along the Shantang from the West Gate to Bao'an Temple, one takes the path through the main Xiaoshidong (Small Stone Cave). The mountain path is approximately two li long. Beside the path stands a stone tablet inscribed with the words: "Path to the Tomb of Huang Dachi, a Yuan Dynasty Recluse." A portion of the tablet's base is buried in the soil. The characters for "Tomb Path" are not easily discernible without close inspection. The narrow sheep path winds deeply for several hundred steps. The undulating mountainside reveals the tomb of the old recluse. Apart from a mound of earth, the site is desolate and silent, devoid of any trees. Behind the tomb stands another stele, reading: "Tomb of Huang Yifeng, a Yuan Dynasty Recluse" (the characters for "Recluse" are inscribed together). The tomb marker is not erected in front of the tomb but behind it, likely due to local customs. Arriving here, paying respects to the relics and honoring the virtuous predecessors, one cannot help but feel a mixture of reverence and sighing. Huang Dachi was a surviving subject of the late Song Dynasty and the founder of the Southern School of painting. His legacy is passed down through a few works, including the "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" scroll. (The "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" scroll is preserved in the National Palace Museum; the first section of the burnt remains, known as the "Remaining Mountain Scroll," is now housed in Yu Mei Jing's study.) Yet, his tomb is so desolate. Repairing and restoring it should not be delayed. It awaits the support of like-minded individuals from across the country. Future visitors can proceed from the Half-Weng Prime Minister's Shrine of White Pigeon Mountain, which is less than a li away. On this day, my companions were Chen Xiaodie, Chen Ziqing, and my students Lu Yifei and Pan Zhiyun (both gentlemen are from Changshu). We also learned that the descendants of Huang Dachi currently reside in Dayiqiao, ten li from the city. The late Duke Kezhai wrote a "Record of the Huang Family's Charity Estate in Dayiqiao" for Mr. Huang Qiutao in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign (1891). June, the thirty-second year of the Republic (1943).</p>
<h3>The Propaganda Department, Together with the Press and Cultural Circles, Host a Grand Farewell Banquet for Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki at the Capital Hotel</h3>
<p>Colonel Iwasaki Harushige, the Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China and the Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, has been ordered to return to his country for a promotion to an important position and will soon leave Shanghai to take up his new post. The Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department and the local press and cultural circles jointly initiated a farewell reception, holding a grand banquet yesterday at the Capital Hotel on Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Lunch Reception</p>
<p>The sudden gathering was held at noon. Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki arrived punctually with his colleagues and subordinates. Government officials accompanying him included Lieutenant Colonel Shisheng Yano, Lieutenant Itagi, Lieutenant Koike, Second Lieutenant Nakagawa, Trustee Akai, and Trustee Ota. The Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department was represented by Director Feng Jie and Secretary Ma Zongyao. The International Propaganda Bureau was represented by Director Tang Liangli and Director Li Zhaojue. Others present included Liu Shike from the Si Bi Jian Jiao Suo (thought censorship and exchange center), Specialist Zheng Zongzheng, Zhong Youcai from the drinking inspection association, Wu Peizhi and Yang Du from the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency, Xu Liqiu, Jia Jiabao, Chu Baoheng, Lei Kuangyuan, and Jiang Yunzhang from the Zhonghua Daily, Chen Binyu from the Shen Bao, Lu Guangjie from the Ping Bao, Yan Cheng Shen Hu from the Xin Zhongguo, Zong Jingze and Su Zhiying Zhu Yongkang from the Guomin Xinwen, Gu Guiyu and Shi Luoshe from the Dalian Xinbao, Xu Songzhichang from the Xin Shen Bao, Ri Gao Dan Mo Sha, Ren Yunpeng from the Shanghai News Federation, Zheng Yu'an from the Zhonghua Daobao, and Ishikawa Fujiwara and Zhang Shanxian and Huang Tianshi from the Shanghai Special City Journalists' Association and the China Film Joint Film Company. Over one hundred guests attended.</p>
<p>Director Feng's Speech</p>
<p>At the beginning of the banquet, Director Feng, representing the entire group, delivered a speech, stating briefly:</p>
<p>Today, our office and the central propaganda organs in Shanghai, together with the local press, are jointly hosting a farewell reception for Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki. Those of us engaged in propaganda work have cooperated with our friendly nation, Japan, in this area for the past two or three years and feel very pleased about it. However, both our friendly nation, Japan, and China are striving to defeat the Anglo-Americans in the Greater East Asia War, which makes our work very busy. We are constantly on the move for the sake of East Asia, and opportunities for meetings are few. Especially this year, when we bid farewell to propaganda officials from our friendly nation, Japan, we cannot help but feel a sense of parting and regret. Furthermore, all propaganda officials who have come to China from our friendly nation, Japan, have returned successfully. We have worked with Minister Iwasaki for a long time, and it is inevitable that we feel reluctant to part with him today. However, the minister has been responsible for his duties in China for a long time, having served in Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai for the past two years. Because of the minister's careful assistance to China, all of our Chinese compatriots are happy to work with him. Just before taking his seat, the minister told me that many of his Chinese friends whom he has met over the past two years do not want him to leave China, and he is also reluctant to leave. From these words, we can deeply understand the minister's hard work and dedication in China. Today, as we bid farewell to the minister, there are many host organizations, which is a testament to the minister's success. We can not only congratulate him on his success but also say that he has achieved great success. On the occasion of this farewell, I represent everyone in raising a glass to wish the minister a bright future." Immediately, the entire assembly raised their glasses.</p>
<p>Iwasaki's Reply</p>
<p>Subsequently, Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki delivered a speech in reply, stating briefly: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the grand farewell reception organized by the propaganda organs and the press and cultural circles of this city. For the past two and a half years that I have served as the chief of the reporting department in China, I have received your special assistance and felt your goodwill and warmth deeply. During my time in China, I served as the Nanjing Reporting Department Chief and the Shanghai Army Reporting Department Chief, and the time spent traveling back and forth was quite short, which meant fewer opportunities to meet with everyone, for which I am deeply regretful. Although I have worked in various locations, my goals have been completely consistent: to strive towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I deeply agree with what Director Feng said earlier. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, especially those in charge of reporting in Shanghai, have worked diligently and provided me with invaluable assistance. Everyone is working towards the Greater East Asia War, which is an extremely important task. As I take up my new post, I hope that everyone will continue to maintain close communication and assistance at all times in order to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War. We have firm confidence in this war and will not rest until we achieve complete victory. I am deeply aware that everyone is devoting great effort to the construction of the New China, and the future of the New China is limitless." Finally, Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki raised his glass to wish everyone present farewell. The atmosphere was joyful, with toasts exchanged and the guests and hosts interacting warmly.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Utilizing Idle Capital to Establish Factories</h3>
<p>The proper outlet for idle capital lies in engaging in production. Currently, the most beneficial productive enterprises for national and people's welfare are undoubtedly those in industry. In this era of worldwide war, the daily necessities of the people cannot rely on imports; they must be manufactured domestically. With China's abundant resources and raw materials, if we have excellent equipment and specialized technical talent, everything needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation can be self-sufficient. For individuals, profits are safest, and for the nation and society, the contribution is greatest. Both publicly and privately, there are great benefits. Those with idle capital, if they use it to establish factories and commence production, will not only build a foundation that lasts for centuries but also find it safer and more secure than anything else. At the same time, entrepreneurs establishing enterprises and companies is essential at present. However, the most promising and socially valued business ventures are undoubtedly those of establishing factories. Compared to hoarding goods or selling real estate, the difference between benefiting oneself and others is obvious even to the unintelligent. However, the financial sector is the backbone of industry. The funding of industrial enterprises depends entirely on banks and money houses. In the future, financiers should consider investing in and lending to industrial enterprises as the safest and most secure path, providing full support and care so that industrialists can focus on improving technology and refining their products without being distracted by financial planning and running around incessantly. This is the responsibility of financiers.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Decides to Adjust Four Banks, Government Shares to be Taken Over by the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has decided to adjust the China General Chamber of Commerce, Ningpo Commercial Bank, China Industrial, and Guohuo banks, which are jointly operated by government and private entities. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association yesterday and learned that the government has already decided on the principles for adjusting the structure of these four banks and will soon announce the order. The government shares of these four banks will henceforth be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank (CRB). The chairman will be appointed by the Ministry of Finance, and government directors and supervisors will be designated by the government, while commercial directors and supervisors will be elected by the shareholders of the commercial shares. In the future, they will operate under the leadership of the CRB, with the aim of developing the national agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. The government has not issued any measures regarding the reorganization of small banks. However, in order to strengthen their organizations, all small banks have voluntarily increased their capital.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Special Committee Sets Deadline for Wheat Procurement</h3>
<p>Since its official establishment, the National Chamber of Commerce's Flour and Wheat Special Committee has been actively implementing an overall plan for wheat procurement, allocation, distribution, marketing prices, etc. In order to strengthen the procurement and manufacturing work of wheat in key producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, branch offices have been established in nine districts, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Taixian, and Bengbu. It has been learned that the committee, with the new wheat expected to enter the market around the 20th of this month, is urging the local offices to establish themselves by the 15th of this month to begin wheat procurement. It is reported that the chairman of the committee, Sun Zhongli, recently convened a discussion meeting with the directors of the local branch offices. In addition to instructing them to actively handle (1) the registration procedures for flour manufacturers, wheat commission merchants, vendors, and wheat firms in each district, (2) the detailed reporting of the local wheat production and sales situation in writing within a specified period, and (3) liaison with local government authorities and detailed explanation of the committee's mission to request their assistance, he especially clarified the committee's tasks and relationships. The list of directors and deputy directors of the local offices is recorded below. The Shanghai office is headed by Cao, the chief of the flour and bran section, concurrently, with Lin Ersan as deputy director. The directors and deputy directors of other cities are: Suzhou: Song Senqian, Koya; Wuxi: Yang Leshan, Koizumi Naoshiji; Changzhou: Yuan Zhiming, Kouchi Non; Zhenjiang: Yan Zhonghe, Maruoka Saburo (interim); Nanjing: Wang Jipu, Kitayama Kakushi; Wuhu: Zhang Boxi, Mochizuki Yoshirō (interim); Taixian: Zhang Fengsheng, Hirose Seitaro; Bengbu: Shi Dechen, Fuji Yoshiichi (interim).</p>
<h3>President Takashima Discusses the Policy of Developing Central China's Economy</h3>
<p>President Takashima Uetsuna and Vice President of the Central China Development Company left Shanghai on the 11th of last month to return to Japan to discuss adjustments to the company's various subsidiaries and other matters, and returned to Shanghai by plane yesterday (11th). According to reports, they had repeated discussions with Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, Ambassador Tani, and other relevant parties regarding various economic issues in Central China. What is most necessary in Central China at present is economic recovery. The Development Company and its subsidiaries should promote their businesses based on this policy in the future. However, in order to adapt to Japan's new policy toward China, they should strive to revitalize the Chinese economy through China. The reorganization of the various companies will also be resolved sequentially in accordance with this policy, taking into account the actual situation. It goes without saying that the Development Company, together with its subsidiaries, will make extra efforts to promote the increased production of important wartime materials. If necessary, they will also invest or lend to general Sino-Japanese joint ventures to promote the development of Central China's economy. In addition, Presidents Takashima and Uetsuna are scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 14th to hold discussions with the National Government and Japanese authorities on the reorganization issue, and then return to Shanghai around the 20th, and then contact the various companies to finalize the details before returning to Japan again on the 25th in order to participate in the Development Company's shareholders' meeting held in Tokyo on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee to be Established on the 19th</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate the hoarding and speculation of major commodities by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Materials Investigation Committee established in Shanghai with the approval of the Supreme National Defense Council has selected sixteen Chinese and Japanese committee members and is actively preparing the organization. It was previously reported that the committee was scheduled to hold its first inaugural meeting on the 14th of this month. It is learned that due to insufficient preparation, the inaugural meeting will be convened on the 19th of this month. The investigation work is currently still underway.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Zhou Talks About the Food Problem</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the recent food problem, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, to inquire about general policies. Vice Minister Zhou received the reporter and discussed the food problem on the spot. Vice Minister Zhou said: "The food problem in wartime not only concerns the people's livelihood, but also the success or failure of policy implementation can affect national policy, because the food problem is the main sector of the economic industry. Before the war, our country had no so-called control policy. After the war, due to actual needs, the government adopted control policies. After the reorganization of the Grain Commission into the Ministry of Food, it has established a concrete plan for the management and sale of food. Although food prices have not yet been suppressed due to various reasons, fortunately, it has been able to dredge sources and increase production, so food supplies have been maintained. The famine in North China this year requires the transportation of grain for relief, and we are also planning to establish and adjust the lower-level institutions to make procurement and distribution more reasonable." Vice Minister Zhou then explained the capital's food problem raised by the reporter, saying: "The capital's public county affairs are in good shape due to the cooperation between the ministry and the city authorities, and the various investigative agencies are also able to investigate to the best of their ability. As for the public rice price problem, the publicly set price of food rice in the capital is lower than that of other ports, and the original price was maintained. However, recently, the reserves in various producing areas have been exhausted, and prices have skyrocketed. Various expenses have increased, and if adjustments are not made, the source of procurement will inevitably be affected, which will hinder the entire grain policy. Therefore, rice prices were increased to 444 yuan this month, but the procurement cost of this ministry is still more than 100 yuan per shi (unit of volume), which is still the lowest compared with the rice prices in other places."</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank's Agricultural Loan to Adopt Commercial Bill Rediscount System</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank will implement agricultural loans in the form of commercial bill rediscounts, starting with loans for wheat procurement funds. The allocation of funds for the procurement of cotton and miscellaneous grains will also be carried out using this system. The implementation method is for the procuring merchants to issue bills and apply for discount to designated Chinese-owned banks, which will then submit the bills to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount.</p>
<p>Wheat Loan Agreed</p>
<p>Regarding wheat procurement loans, due to the approaching wheat market season, the funds required by Chinese buyers must be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank as soon as possible. However, there were concerns about the form of bank loans, so after consultation between the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Central Reserve Bank, it was decided to use the commercial bill rediscount method. The bill discount rate and bill issuer are still to be determined.</p>
<p>Bank of Communications Actively Handles Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>Also, the Bank of Communications was ordered to handle agricultural loans, and added an Agricultural Economics Department to the bank on the 5th of last month. It is now aware that the financial needs of rural areas are extremely urgent, and has sent personnel to Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Dongtai to prepare for the establishment of agricultural economic offices, which are limited to two months for establishment and implementation of lending. At the same time, the bank's Agricultural Economics Department has responded to requests from agricultural institutions and merchants in Wuxi, northern Jiangsu, and near Shanghai, and has granted a total of 12 million yuan in various loans for cotton, cultivation, pig farming, agronomy, agricultural tool manufacturing, and farmland operation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soap Industry Association Established</h3>
<p>The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Central China Soap Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 11th (previous day) and elected the responsible organizations as follows: (1) Chairman: Japan Oil &amp; Fat; (2) Vice Chairman: Mitsubishi; (3) Accountant: Daimaru Trading; (4) Directors: Mitsui Idemitsu Trading. The association will also convene a general meeting in the near future, and the representatives attending will be determined by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market shifted from weakness to stability, and the price of gold and goods hardened, which stabilized the shaky confidence of all parties. However, the initial weakness in the morning was excessive, and although it rebounded later, most stocks still closed lower. Trading on Saturday was slow. Among the pharmaceutical stocks, French Chinese Pharmaceutical was firm, New Asia still stood at the checkpoint, Xinyi Pharmaceutical's Da Guan Zhu Yi persisted, and Wuzhou and Zhongxi rose slightly. In the department store sector, Wing On recovered after weakness, Sincere and China-made remained stable, China Underwear had little trading at the same price, and Jingfu Socks showed a slight improvement. In the textile sector, Wing On Cotton Mill suffered a slight setback, and Mayar Silk Mills closed flat. In the cultural sector, Yichang was depressed, and the selling prices of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Book Company fell again. In the public utilities sector, the situation of Zhabei Water and Electricity changed little, the transaction price of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company suddenly increased, and the Great China Match was weak.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: In the gray market for unified government bonds, the prices of A, B, C, D, and E bonds all fell, but the internal bond rose uniquely, and trading was not active.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Jewelry gold in silver shops is priced at the limit price, but the handling fee has increased, and the transaction price inside and outside the industry has risen again, close to the limit price. The listed price of sycee silver remained unchanged, and the doing price within and without the industry was hidden at the checkpoint.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Cotton yarn was quiet due to continuous rain and the weekend, the market was slightly stronger for fine yarn, and there were very few transactions. Cotton cloth was bullish, and there were still floating households buying in, and the supply from all parties was weak, and market prices hovered. Dragon Head Fine Cloth, Four Gentlemen's Serge, Peach Blossom Ladies' Fabric all rose, while White Cat Printed Cloth, Qin Liangyu Bleached Cloth prices did not change.</p>
<h3>Industry Association Activities</h3>
<p>Brewing Industry: The city's Brewing Industry Association has been established and started operations. The deadline for member registration has also passed. The association believes that restaurants and pubs in the city that sell alcohol should also join the association to facilitate future distribution for business purposes. However, as these establishments have not yet joined, which is considered illegal, the association has submitted a document to the Food Bureau, based on industrial and commercial organization laws, requesting them to instruct the Restaurant and Pub Industry Association to notify all restaurants and pubs to join promptly. Otherwise, when distribution matters are implemented in the future, they will not be allocated supplies, inevitably preventing them from running related businesses.</p>
<p>Glass Industry: The Economic Bureau has designated individuals to be responsible for the preparatory work of the city's Glass Industry Association. A founding meeting is scheduled to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 13th) to approve the articles of association and elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<p>Tea Industry: The Food Bureau has designated Huang Jingqi, Xu Rongsen, Li Guozhi, and others as preparatory members for the Shanghai District Tea and Confectionery Industry Association. They have formed a preparatory committee to begin preparations and handle member registration, which will end on the 15th. All tea merchants operating in the Shanghai urban area must join the association.</p>
<p>Coarse and Fine Pigment Industry: After being ordered to merge with the Western Pigment Industry Association to form the Shanghai Special City Pigment Business Association, the city's Coarse and Fine Pigment Industry Miscellaneous Goods Association believed that the nature of the industry differed from that of the Western Pigment Industry, making it difficult to merge. In addition to submitting written requests to the relevant authorities for permission to organize an independent association to prevent disputes and facilitate control, it is now learned that the industry will send representatives to petition.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Road branch of the Ta Kung Bank in this port opened a branch in the French Concession at 26-28 Avenue Edward VII last month. It has been decided that an examination for accounting personnel will be held on Sunday morning, the 13th of this month, starting at 9:00 AM. Examiners have been appointed to conduct the examination solemnly, and the results will be used as a reference for adjusting positions in the future based on merit.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of the Commercial Control Council's Work Entering a New Phase</h3>
<p>Since the Commercial Control Council (商統會) was transferred to the Executive Yuan, it was decided to establish all lower-level organizations before June 15th. However, with the scheduled date approaching, it is currently rushing to complete all unfinished matters and promptly establish the unorganized federations. Sixteen types of federations and four types of professional committees have already been established, and the lower-level organizations are generally in place, entering a period of concrete work. The working force will inevitably become more important in the future. The current working situation of the Commercial Control Council is generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Established and Unestablished Federations</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty-two federations, including six federations related to the old Ministry of Food system and sixteen federations related to the old Ministry of Industry system. As of June 7th, sixteen have been established, leaving only six. These six federations are scheduled to be established by the 15th of this month. The established federations include: Miscellaneous Grain Industry Federation (hereinafter, the five characters "Industry Federation" will be omitted), Flour Industry, Animal Husbandry Industry, Egg Industry, Sugar Industry, Edible Oil Industry, Soap and Candle Industry, Match Industry, Chemical Industry, Cotton Textile Industry, Coal Industry, Department Store Industry, Silk Industry, Leather Industry, Alcohol Industry, and Tobacco Industry, totaling sixteen industries. The unestablished federations include the Metal Industry, Wool Textile Industry, Cotton Industry, Glass Industry, Rubber Industry, and Electrical Industry. As for the twenty-two federations decided by the Ministries of Industry and Food, most have been established under the guidance of the Commercial Control Council. After establishment, the focus will be placed on the most important commodity federations, and organizational preparation can also be considered complete.</p>
<p>(2) Professional Committees</p>
<p>Among the planned professional committees, the Flour and Wheat, Cotton, Sugar, and Oil and Grain committees have been established.</p>
<p>(3) Guidance Work for Federations</p>
<p>Regarding the guidance work for the federations in various industries, the Commercial Control Council has instructed senior officials of the council to work with the federations to study the following points: (1) How to delineate the industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. (2) How to reorganize the organizational system of the federations. (3) Is it necessary to increase or decrease the directors and supervisors of the federations? (4) How to adjust the material procurement and distribution relationship of the federations. (5) How to determine the regulations of the federations in various industries. (6) How to handle the admission and withdrawal of members from the industry associations. (7) How to seek the rationalization of loan issues. From the above points, it can be seen that the work of the Commercial Control Council has entered a new stage, and its activities after June 15th are particularly noteworthy.
