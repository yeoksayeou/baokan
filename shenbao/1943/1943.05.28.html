<h3>「親日派」的使命</h3>
<p>日前論兩種親日派，曾嚴正地指出眞正的親日派，不僅在目前時勢下所迫切需要，而且在未來新中國的建設中，和大東亞新秩序的建設中，也非常需要。就常前的事實說，抱着一已的據利觀念而　入親日陣營的人固然不少，但是懷抱革命愛國愛日本愛東亞之心理，依據其高遠的識見與卓越的精神，而挺身於中日合作事業的，實佔大多數。一般人民過去於飽經憂患之餘，對於第二種親日派即虛偽的親日派，固然存過痛心疾首的心理，可是最近幾年來第一種親日派之眞誠謀國的苦心，已經漸漸深入國民的心坎，只要是沒有頑固的放見，大家對於第一種親日派開始了解與發生好感。不過，同時我們要認淸，中國社會階層的複雜，因此，雖然參加第一種親日派之列，抱着同一的革命救國的目標，和協力日本爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利的信念，但是各人的認識與所取的步驟，也許不能完全一致。益以第二種僞親日派的作崇，結果，無論對內對外一切施策方面，都不能不遭遇到若干阻碍，或引起不必要的誤會。爲了中國的前途，爲了東亞的前途，我們深深感覺到每一個眞正的親日派，必須更正確地認濟自己在目前時代中所處的地位之重要，及自己對於祖國對於東亞所負的責任之艱鉅，而更嚴肅起來，積極起來。我們深信下列幾件事，是値得常前每一個眞正的親日派所應加以深長思慮，進而求其實現的。</p>
<p>從親日派的本身說，要改正國人對親日派的視聽，更確實和廣泛地建立起自己的信譽，這是保障當前一切對內對外政策的基礎。爲了實現這一點，所應立即採取的步驟，我們認爲至少有下述三點：第一，在消極方面必須與第二種親日派分離，政府領導人物，一方面要自己警惕，自己檢討，另一方面應注意部屬中是否有第二種親日派溷跡，而加以肅清。世界上任何健全的組織之成功，必然經過難苦奮鬥的過程中發展起來的，這種奮鬥，不僅是對外，允重在對內。就以目前大戰以來的事實而論，如日本的政府機構，會不斷的刷新改善；又如納粹德國對於本身之改革，與日俱進。這種行動譬如防疫，我們忍受了一時的輕微痛苦，就可以防止未來熱烈的病患之發生。第二，在積極方面·要健全眞正親日派之間加强聯繫，鞏固團結，允須多注意於幹部的敎育與培養。我們敢於斷言，親日派本身的健全，比任何對外宣傳，防衛等等工作都有實效。民心之最後向背，大部分也取決於此。此其一。</p>
<p>從中國的處境而言，第一種親日派的當前使命，雖然千頭萬緒，然而簡單說來，不過是加緊集中全國力量，協助日本爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，以保障中國之和平，獨立與自由發展。而要完成這一個使命，其基本的步驟，就是由於政治的鬥爭，促成中國之全面和平。因爲渝共的負嶼抱戰，一方面在國際意義上說，它是擾亂了大東後方，牽制了一部份日軍，這是敵方所引以爲欣幸的。在參戰的責任下，親日派首應加重政治上的努力，共的頑抗。其决，從本國利害而言，由於全面和平的迄未實現，一方面形成國家建設之無法進行，總力動底，一切政治，軍事，經濟，文化等都呈現停滯狀態。另一方面，又使國力分散，元氣難於恢復，因此，</p>
<p>國，日本和東亞的大計之推行貫澈，就受到影響。所以如何運用政治方面，加緊奮鬥，以促成全面和平，應該是眞正親日派當前最大的任務。此其二。</p>
<p>從東亞國際關係而言，我國今日爲東亞軸心三國之一，同時也是大東亞戰爭的主要後方，隨着世界戰爭之發展，我國地位將益形重要，我國的責任也將愈趨艱鉅。至於戰後我國在東亞及在世界的國際關係，尤爲每一個愛國者必須首先研究的問題。這裏我們至少要注意下列幾點：第一，過去我們只聞日本之對華政策，尚未聞我國的對日政策，這在國民的立塲說，是値得提出的問題。隨着今後中日關係之演進及國際關係之發展，我們要求政府確立對日政策，這也是親日派目前的重要任務。第二，過去日本對中國親日派的態度，是最値得研究，並進而希望日方充分認識兩種親日派的不同所在，使中日關係步入正軌。第三，對於戰後的中日關係，東亞諸國間的關係，復員問題，建設問題，也應早有充分的研究與準備，我們所期待於眞正的親日派者。此其三。</p>
<p>我們今日處在最嚴重的國際形勢之下，對內對外，有了良好的政策綱領還不够，主要的還要靠決心和實踐，因此，眞正的親日派，必須本其愛中國愛日本兼愛東亞之赤誠，與日本協力，解決已經發生和可能發生的東亞整個問題，謀求中日兩國國策之貫澈。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之紀載　舊報新抄（八）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認清今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美插足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴強大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任難钜，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧怍。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，摘爲新抄，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尚祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>

<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營海軍報道部長矢野英雄少將，以二十七日爲日本第三十八屆海軍紀念日，特於是晚七時半，假東京中央廣播電台向全國廣播，題爲「慶祝決戰下之海軍紀念日。」茲悉其大意如下。。「吾人於大東亞戰爭之決戰下，慶祝此含義深長之海軍紀念日。最難忘懷者，厥爲於本年四月在南太平洋前綫，壯烈殉國之聯合艦隊司令長官山本元帥，盡忠報國之赤誠，與其擊潰敵人之敢鬥精神。夫日本海海戰一役，我東鄉元帥所部之海軍所以獲得歷史上空前之勝利者，實爲東鄉元帥及全體將士以盡忠報國之赤誠，與一致擊滅敵人之精神而努力奮戰所致。在大東亞戰爭中，我國海軍士兵以其傳統之精神，日夜奮鬥，遂有聯合艦隊司令長官山本元帥之壯烈殉國。山本元帥之壯烈殉國，實足以證明我國海軍「指揮官身先士卒」及「求敵必殺」之光輝傳統精神。吾人綜觀世界戰局之現階段，深感今年實爲一決戰年，現我國已與德義等國團結一致，以國家民族興廢爲重，舉共總力與英美相抗，一再展開激戰。太平洋戰局自今春以來，敵我雙方不分晝夜展開激烈之空戰，同時美軍曾於本月十二日，在有以水上艇隊及空軍之掩護下，在阿圖島登陸，現該島我守軍正以寡兵邀擊，激戰仍在進行中，此乃美國因開戰以來屢戰屢北，故向我人挑戰，謀先在太平洋上獲得必要之根據地。考敵軍之企圖惟在逐漸向前推進基地，擴大自己制空權之範圍，以謀在制空權之下，實行海上決戰，並圖竭盡所能空襲我本土。我國海軍對此次與陸軍部隊相協力，在陸海空之方面相互策應，加以猛擊，炸毀敵之基地，並不斷威脅其聯絡運輸路綫，卓著戰果。又美國刻正企圖由渝方基地空襲日本，虎視耽耽伺機而動，積極擴充駐渝美空軍，同時亟欲駐印美英軍奪回緬甸，重開緬甸路，但後因日陸軍之奮力作戰，英美軍在阿拉坎戰役中全軍慘敗，卒未能實現其目的。美國今年度之飛機產量，以陸海空軍機合計十二萬五千架爲目標，並誇稱現已能月產飛機七千架云，一方則動員全國學生，企圖養成大批飛行人員。又美國之艦艇建造狀况，計有第三次文生案及大西太平兩洋海軍建設計劃，開戰後成立之第一次第二次第一次建艦計劃等，合計八百二十七艘，三百三十九萬噸之建艦計劃，刻似正傾全力進行中。上述美國之積極增强航空兵力海上兵力及船舶，其理由蓋欲企圖以數種優勢壓倒日本。日本刻亦有備無恐，如敵由空中而來，即在空中摧破之，由海上而來，即在海上擊減之，故正抱定此種決心，而增强航空兵力海上兵力及航舶。國民心血結晶所造之各種新銳飛機已相繼出擊，新銳軍艦及强力之新艦艇亦巍然出現於洋上。我人現在之敎訓，僅有「前進」二字，僅有堅持必勝之信念邁進而已。古賀峰一大將拜奉聯合艦隊司令長官之大命時，即對部下全體將士表明追隨山本元帥及其他在天英靈，鞠躬盡瘁，以完成護國大任之決心。現聯合艦隊之士氣益昂，誓在新司令長官之統率下一致團結，澈底擊滅敵人，藉期上奉聖明，現當戰局重大之秋，迎此光輝之海軍紀念日，我國海軍誓與全國國民共向擊滅敵人之途邁進。</p>
<h3>航空母艦活躍</h3>
<p>十二月八日是世界歷史轉換的一天，是日黎明前大隊航空母艦，一路東進，空襲夏威夷，使美國精銳聯合艦隊　滅，肅淸了殘害亞洲全民族的工具，啓示了建設東亞的曙光。</p>
<h3>保衛大東亞的戰艦</h3>
<p>我們在建設中的大東亞共榮團，是世界第一寶康，占世界最多人口，具世界新蕉文化。面積廣闊，全憑海做屏藩，所以少不了大戰艦，大海軍，幸而我東亞已有日本的戰必勝，攻必克的雖偉海軍，給我們做萬里長城。</p>
<h3>蘇清鄉區獻金購機　國府頒令嘉獎</h3>
<p>南京廿七日中央社電國府令，（五月廿七日）查江蘇省淸鄉區各界擁護參戰購機獻金，前由該省省長呈匯嚴慶鮮獻金卅八萬八千八百八十八元八角八分，業飭核收在案。茲據該獻金代表團團長李士羣，副團長黃敬齋，袁殊，總幹事史訓遷，副總幹事蔣鍾麟等面呈獻金辭，並賚到國幣一百一十二萬元。先後合計獻金一百五十萬零八千八百八十八元八角八分，請購置飛機，命名淸鄉號及江蘇號，以助空防等情，該代表團團長副團長等宣導大計，該省淸鄉區民衆輸財衛國，洵屬忠義可風，殊堪嘉獎。此次獻金仍由行政院轉飭財政部核收，並轉飭知照，此令。</p>
<h3>國防會議議決蘇北行營　改爲綏靖主任公署　蘇北各縣劃歸蘇省府管理</h3>
<p>南京廿七日中央社電　昨日（廿七日）最高國防會議第十六次會議，通過要案，摘錄如下：（一）主席交議，秘書處案呈，准中政會秘書廳檢送，奉交行政院呈據司法部呈，爲在戰時房屋租賃特別法施行前，繫屬於各級法院受審之案件，擬均適用本法判斷，呈請核示一案，轉呈鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過。未決案件，照此判斷，但不溯及旣往。（二）主席交議，擬改蘇北行營爲駐蘇北綏靖主任公署，並將蘇北各縣交還江蘇省政府，設置江蘇省第一區行政督察專員公署，請公決案，決議通過。駐蘇北綏靖公署主任，由軍委會委長兼任，張北生任駝蘇北綏靖主任公署參謀長，原參謀長富雙英，另有任用，原秘書長掌牧民免職。（三）新運會委員何庭流免職，特派黃大中爲新運會委員，因以敎育廳長資格充任，特派龍沐助爲新運會委員。</p>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　二十七日之第十六次最高國防會議中，通過主席交議軍委會委員長蘇北行營改設綏靖主任公署，並將現蘇北各縣，劃歸江蘇省政府管理，設第一區行政督察專員公署一案。政界人士認爲此乃軍政劃分，並强化省行政之措置。蘇北十餘縣，物產豐裕，民風樸茂，事變前爲江蘇省政府治下一環。國府還都後，鑒於該地區治安上之重要性，以及省政府行政力，當時未能浸透及此地區，乃於三十年設置蘇北行營，施行軍政，蘇北行營臧卓主任調任後，即以秘書長參謀長分掌軍政事宜。兩年以來治安日見確立，行政亦入正軌，所有特殊狀態，已不復存在。江蘇省第一區行政督察專員張北生，任綏靖公署參謀長，蘇北地區軍政一元化原則，已於此實現。行營改粗爲綏靖主任公署後，並由軍事委員長親兼主任，此點於國防治安見地觀之，尤爲重要。綏靖主任公署設置後，軍委會下之綏靖公署，合武漢廣州開封等署，已有四處。當地之國軍部隊，以及地方治安等事，自然由於綏靖公署承管。同時江蘇省轄縣，自亦因此加多，可視爲地方行政區劃改進之新獻。又特派黃大中爲新運會委員，黃氏爲現湖北省敎育廳長，以此資格，充任新運會委員，自屬當然。龍沐勛原爲中大敎授，爲一有名靑年指導者。</p>
<p>南京廿七日電　國府令，（卅二年五月廿七日）蘇北行營着即撤銷，此令。設駐蘇北綏靖主任公署，暫由軍事委員會委員長兼任主任此令。蘇北各縣歸還江蘇省政府管轄，設行政督察專員公署于泰縣，以督察蘇北各縣行政，定名爲江蘇省第一區行政督察專員公署此令。</p>
<h3>建設部　擬定三年計劃</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　建設部近根據實際情形，已擬定建設三年計劃，計有水利公路及都市建設三大部分：（一）水利方面，以預弭水患保障農田增進農產爲目的，預定計劃中工程較大者，（一）開闢蘇北新運河，以便利灌漑獲益，及增拓農田的有五百萬畝之多。（二）浚墾東太湖，可拓闢耕地的三十萬畝，以增農產。（三）修復皖江，以俾農田不受江水倒灌之虞。（四）整理導淮河入海水道，以防止水息。其他尚有江河修防，改善蘇省芙蓉圩，修復江陰以上通江各闡，並設班訓練水利技術人員等計劃。（二）公路方面以增强交通運輸，確保運輸上連絡爲目的，預定計劃有（一）修築京滬幹綫以確保政治經濟之連絡。（二）修築京蚌滬徵淮等有關國防各重要幹綫。（三）審促地方政府修築支綫，以完成交通網。（四）都市建設方面，以復興都市造福民生爲目的，預定第一年度計劃有（一）設立新國民生活示範館爲針治國人生活之窳敗，並推行新國民運動，以求民衆正常生活之由示範而擴展。（二）設立磚瓦製造廠，以俾建築材料供給之圓滑。（三）建築平民住宅與開辦三輪車公司，以解決一般市民住與行的困難。除以上各項事業外，並有各都市之實地調查，以及整飭各都市之市容等計劃。以上計劃聞已呈行政院請款興辦，將來計劃完成，有俾於國計民生實非淺鮮。又聞該部對於本市交通亟欲整理，擬先行舉辦蓄雷池車，現正在試騐行車中，將來如能實現，都市交通工具之缺乏，當可解決。</p>

<h3>發揚傳統精神</h3>
<p>— 鎌田大佐</p>
<p>昨日爲日本第三十八屆海軍紀念節，值茲大東亞戰爭節節勝利之際，意義益覺深長。日駐華艦隊報道部長鎌田大佐，特於二十七日晚七時二十分起，在虹口國際劇塲發表紀念演講。題爲：「發揚傳統精神」，對於日本海軍之傳統精神闡發至詳。茲誌鎌田大佐講演內容於次：</p>
<p>（一）　前言</p>
<p>本日爲聖將東鄉元帥率領我聯合艦隊於對島海面邀擊俄國波羅的海艦隊加以擊滅，不但造成皇國興隆之轉機，但劃一興亞黎明時期之日本海海戰第三十八次紀念日是也。</p>
<p>當時旗艦三笠之檣頂，高揚「皇國興廢在此一戰，各員　勵努力」之Z字旗。不期在前年十二月八日，再度飛揚於珍珠港，自此以來，非獨我艦隊將士爲然，是凡皇國一億國民以及全東亞各民族之眼前，永遠商場此「皇國興廢在此一戰，各員奮勵努力」之Z字旗。</p>
<p>然交戰國不分彼我，咸謂此一二年爲決戰期，但當茲時際，須囘憶當時追念前　偉業，同時加强對現在完遂大東亞戰爭之決意，更應打開今後將逢到之幾多難關，以期建設光輝之東亞共榮　，得無遺憾。本人當今日之紀念日，能以「發揚傳統精神」爲題，略抒紀念之意，誠屬無上光榮也。</p>
<p>（二）　發揚傳統精神</p>
<p>自古以來，在東方有「凡事物之成非成於成功之一日」之言。又西洋方面，亦有「羅馬之成功非一日之功」，余每閱歷史，益認此說之不謬。我日本爲現在世界上最崇高無比之國家，爲世界各國國民　異讚嘆不置，但此並非一朝一夕之功。溯明治天皇下賜之敎育勅語中有曰：「我皇祖皇宗肇國，樹德於宏遠，我臣民應克忠克孝，億兆一心，世世以濟厥美，此爲我國體之精華。」又賜優　之訓諭，諭日，「一旦有緩急，應義勇率公，以扶翼天壤無窮之皇運。』故吾人深切認識基礎，實築於歷代天皇威德，及吾等祖先忠孝一心築成之傳統精神上。又今日我等應銘記一億一心之忠誠，所以扶　天壤無窮之皇運於萬世普　處今日之歷史轉　期，以「發揚傳統精神」爲匯，同憶日本海海戰，申述當時養成之傳統精神，如何能於今日之大東亞戰爭海虎中　更發揚光大，以爲各位適應時局之參考資料。</p>
<p>（三）　日本海海虎之戰訓</p>
<p>日本海海戰實爲曠古之大海戰，其戰果又屬空前者，但此戰果當然完全歸功於御　威，此固不必言。但幷爲當時前盟將士效學日淸戰爭，及更以前之我海戰史上戰訓，並予以實施之結果也。而今日檢討千古不滅之戰訓，以爲今後之南　，余思此屬極有意義者。第一：全體艦隊將士深切認識皇國之興廢，在於海，海爲我國之生命綫，爲固守光榮之國土，我等必須「護海」。上述一點，於東鄉長官當解散聯合艦隊時，對麾下訓示中劈頭即謂「吾人應覺悟永遠保特戰後之收果，更扶持國運之昌隆，不問承平時代或戰時，應率先站於外銜洫軍宜常保持其武力於海洋，以應一朝緩急」。此種覺悟爲今日全體海軍將士所抱之信念，而此種信念，必須永久保持之。第二：然起擊滅之精神，當聯合艦隊白鎭濤出動時，東鄉長官拍電致大本營，共第一電報稱：「已接發覓敵艦之警報，聯合艦隊立刻出動，決予以擊滅之。本日天氣晴朗，但海浪極高云。於此即可見滅敵之意氣，躍然紙上，有此擊滅精神，始可每戰必捷，擊滅精神與必勝之信念，文字上雖異，但其意義則」也。我一億國民，不論逢到如何難關，此信念決不能所有動搖，則勝利可操左券。又具此信念，則生馬革裏屍之決意。茲舉下列二例，爲日本海海戰決定勝利之主因，實爲發揮擊滅精神之最顯着實例。（一）東鄉長官於下午二時〇五分，距敵的八千米時，突自南南西之針路轉舵勇敢決斷棘向東北東轉針約一百六十度。（二）在敵彈似雨中，靜候不動，一待時機成熟，即倫發砲此種敵前轉舵。即在演習時並被視爲最劣之下策，敵方自喜，『東鄉失策，我已得勝利，』敵見我方各艦位置，一時中止，於二時〇七分許，敵旗艦『斯伐洛夫』號上冒白烟，同時全部敵艦齊發，猛烈砲火，站於最前綫之三笠附近，巨彈如雨，砲彈與水烟蔽沒艦影，至是時長官猶不命發砲，直至二時十一分許，於六千四百米距離，方始命令『開始發砲。』</p>
<p>自敵方發砲至我方發砲之四五分種問，飛來之敵彈的計三百餘發，致旗　三笠號於未發一彈前，已略受損害矣。然該艦勇斷忍苦，我艦隊陣勢，乃楛攔敵艦隊之前，集中猛烈砲火於最前之敵二艦，成功一了字形　我艦之砲火，經平日之猛烈訓練，於今發揮其效果，其後三十分種間，乃決定海戰之勝負，故可謂皇國之興廢，安危乃在此三十分種間。（三）敵艦投降時，東鄉元帥之態度，由戰艦八艘，巡洋艦九艘，海防艦三艘，驅逐艦九艘，僞裝巡洋艦一艘，特務艦六艘，醫院船二艘，合計共三十八艘，總排水量二十一萬一千一百二十噸組成之俄國艦隊，經二日一夜之激戰，被我擊沉十九艘，其餘分頭逃竄，或自行炸沉，其餘多遭中立國扣留，被解除武裝，得平安逃逸者，僅小型巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，曁特務艦一艘而已。敵司令官納勃加托夫少將，率戰艦二艘，及海務艦二艘，於二十八日晨，歷盡艱辛，始逃至鬱陸島附近，但仍於該處爲我主力艦隊包圍砲擊，卒告降下軍艦旗，表示投降，是時三笠艦橋上見此情景之一幕僚揚言，稱「長官敵巳舉降伏之旗，請下令停止發砲，」但長官依然不下「停止發砲」之命令，對該幕僚稱「雖已揭揚白旗，但該敵艦仍加緊速力，且其砲口對準我方，距停止發砲之時問尚早」。仍繼續發砲，見敵艦停駛後，始命令停止發砲，此若謂束鄉元帥係冷澈無情之提督，事實決非如此，東鄉元帥實爲把捏「擊滅敵人方休」之擊滅精神眞髓之元帥也。於過去歷史上，屢見功虧一簣之人，但大東亞戰爭性質逈異，我皇國一億國民應貫澈此擊滅必勝之精神，有如山本元帥之言，美國若不在白宮作城下之誓，則我人決不停戰。</p>
<p>（四）大東亞戰爭與帝國海軍</p>
<p>日俄海戰最後所揭揚之Z旗，當大東亞戰爭勃發之初，被使用於雄大無比之珍珠灣閃電奇襲作戰，此Z旗不但表示珍珠灣奇襲戰，爲皇國興廢之所寄，且此决戰爭，係決戰之持久戰，在大東亞戰爭存續期間，此Z旗實爲鼓舞振作我海軍將士之命令。又一億國民不論其係如何職業，處於如何時刻，亦俱深切認識其職業。其時刻無不有關於皇國之興廢，當時遵從先人漱訓，傾注全力，滅私奉公，奮力邁進，我海軍將士常具堅固決心，以謀樹立較祖先尤爲優秀之功勳。並期示後進，以光輝傳統之模範，而扶翼無窮之皇運。珍珠灣奇襲閃電戰第一第二特別攻擊隊，壯烈無比之强襲，一分鐘發的彈丸達六萬發，又施放魚雷擊沉誇稱不沉戰艦「威爾斯親王號」，並「雷柏爾斯號」，馬來海戰（十二月十日）當時航空隊之猛襲，發揮近代立體戰之妙。棉蘭降下傘部隊之奇襲作戰，（一月十七日）遠　美本土加里福尼亞海岸（二月廿四日）潛水艇之砲擊，中途島之猛　，（六月五日）所羅門羣島之夜襲，（八月十四日）以及其他各次空戰之突擊戰術，凡此均不外係擊滅精神之顥　。大東亞戰爭開戰以來，至短時期以內，即將盤踞於太平洋之英美兩國勢力，完全擊滅肅清，其企圖襲斷大東亞壓迫日本之野心，而我國得在太平洋優游漫步之實力，由此發榮滋長，大東亞戰爭如上所述自珍珠　因電戰以來，迭經奇襲，强襲，突擊等連續作戰，然何以具有如此性格，實係我　軍傳統魂發揚所致。然何以產生此種傳統魂，則此爲國體之精華，及我海軍在海戰當時常不得不在以寡敵衆之環境中作戰之故，以寡敵衆如出以優柔戰法，實難以取勝，然僅出以捨身戰法，並非必勝，至此發揮現代科學全能之現代戰爭，僅以盲目的玉體突擊，實不克奏功，此種捨身戰法，亦必須加以理智的計劃，反覆訓練，首先確信，必能奏功，然後向前突進，東鄉元帥在聯合艦隊解散當時，曾致　稱，」神常賜勝利於注力平素鍛練不戰而已獲勝之軍隊」。木記念日前常地海軍協會支部曾徵求標語第一名之標語，爲「五五三月月金玉體突擊。」其中五五三係表示日本海軍對英美海軍之比率，月月金係表示追憶屈辱之華庇倫敦條約，敵愾同仇，每週不斷從事訓練，信賴所得之神技，加以捨身之玉體突擊，我海軍之輝煌戰緒，乃由此造成。</p>

<p>瑞典京城廿七日中央社電　德蘇兩軍自於廿五日晨在東綫中部戰綫維里基魯基西南地區展開坦克車大戰後，似已完全陷於混戰狀態。據德國新聞社消息稱，德軍因不堪數量優勢之蘇軍壓迫，會一度實行退至新陣地，待增援之預備軍開到後，廿五日夜遂再開始猛烈反攻，蘇軍受創甚重而敗退，前失三地亦復完全奪回。又庫彭地區狄姆留克北方之德軍，曾於廿六日開始猛攻，與蘇軍展開白刃戰後，經長時間之激鬥，蘇軍陣亡四百，乃全潰退。是役德軍除俘虜蘇軍六百名外，並獲得七·六二生的砲陣地兩處及自動步槍迫擊砲甚夥，而陣地亦因得改善云。</p>
<p>北路作戰極感困難</p>
<p>柏林廿七日中央社電德國新聞社訊：德軍界人士力言列寗格勒德軍前綫之重要及蘇方之軍事目標。謂自冬季以來，東綫之德軍梯形陣地，會屢决使蘇軍之企圖宣告失敗。蘇軍目前之目標，顯爲解除列寗格勒之危脅，但實際上其計劃之範圍遠較廣大，蘇方欲突破伏爾克霍夫與披普斯問之德軍陣綫，俾可開入愛沙尼亞，重行開放芬蘭海灣，截斷芬蘭及挪威前綫與東綫德軍間之連終，並經由斯堪的那維亞而與英國取得連絡。當三月廿五日拉多加湖附近大戰告一段落時，該區德軍又會擊破蘇軍一切企圖，蘇軍之唯一收獲，僅爲一片狹小之土地，作爲與列寗格勒之連絡點，但所付之代價則極高。現因一切供應品可取道拉多加湖而至列寗格勒，故此狹小之走廊殊無大用。查拉多加湖大戰時，德軍須在東北兩前綫同時作戰，其結果則蘇軍方面共死傷兵士百萬人及損失大批軍火，德軍爲保持此方面前綫，曾在極困難之形勢下作戰，因其地森林濃密，沼澤甚多，且多蚊虻爲患，德軍隨時須放下武器而以斧鋤等開闢道路，德軍曾得西班牙志願師團及愛沙尼亞拉特維亞與荷蘭之志願兵協助作戰。須知此項戰事，並非一地之得失所可決斷共勝負，而係連續殲滅敵軍至其完全衰竭而後已。</p>

<h3>羅邱商談　現已達最後階段　斯達林再度接見台維斯</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹廿七日中央社電　據華盛頓消：羅邱會議巳達最後階段，週三晨尚繼續商討。</p>
<p>期德哥爾摩二十七日中央社電據倫敦各瑞典記者之通訊內稱，英京人士靜候羅邱華盛頓會議結果之最後公報已不耐煩，並對於此項公報之是吾將爲反軸心攻勢之開端，頗多揣測。據瑞典新聞報訪員電稱，此項公報大的須待英相邱吉返抵倫敦後始予公布，於此可見邱氏或已在返國途中。</p>
<p>柏林廿六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊柏林政界方面宣稱：邱吉爾竹相對華盛頓報界所發表之言論，又足以表明其極力迎合美國公衆。英美向以歐洲戰塲爲最重要，對於太平洋戰綫以爲不甚重要，美國方面最近對此已漸起反對，此乃顯著之事實。因此邱古爾不得不再中明歐洲戰綫與太平洋戰綫之相等，藉以表明其欲綏靖美國之輿論。蓋美國之輿論對於戰事之指揮表示駭異，並對於英政府所採態度有所疵議。</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩二十七日中央社電　據莫斯科無綫電訊：斯達林昨又接見美總統專使台維斯，蘇外交人民委員長莫洛托夫亦在座，討論事件不詳。</p>

<h3>發揚傳統精神</h3>
<p>— 鎌田大佐</p>
<p>（接第二版）</p>
<p>余等常體會此秤敎訓，無論爲今日頗囂塵上之生產戰，或日常之微細業務，必須加以理智的周到細密計劃，反覆訓練，當實施之際，如出以豪膽的玉體突擊精神，則確信萬事決無不成之理，按據該次實戰總騐所得之貴重教訓，必須加以充分玩味，不可忽視。</p>
<p>（五）山本元帥之陣亡</p>
<p>五月二十一日下午二時，日大本營發表，山本聯合艦隊司令長官在南方最前綫交戰，飛機上壯烈陣亡，余等軍人固不待言，即一億國民，亦無不哀痛逾恒，難以名狀。</p>
<p>山本大將自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，在雄大無比之計劃之下，統率聯合艦隊指導作戰，一年半以來，上庇皇威與陸軍緊密協力，確立必時不敗之態勢，樹立千古不滅之偉勳，此爲國內外人士共所深悉，無待贅述。</p>
<p>我海軍將士仍繼山本長官之遺志，敵愾共討，益同擊滅英美之決意，以期上安聖慮，此節業由易田海相發表談話加以闡明，反復訓練堅如鐵壁之帝國海軍，傳統精神決無些微動搖。</p>
<p>山木元帥之壯烈氣魄，益增我海軍光輝，在英美未曾擊滅以前，此種捨身戰法決不停止。况深悉當地情形之古賀大將，已以堅固決意與遠大深謀，足踐故元帥之遺血，出任前綫指揮耶。</p>
<p>次就聯合艦隊長官所負之重責，略加申述：</p>
<p>參加作戰之船艦與飛機種類甚多，船艦有戰鬥艦。巡洋艦。驅逐艦。以及潛水艦等，性能各不相同，飛機亦有戰鬥機。轟炸機。偵察機。及攻擊機性能各異，欲集中目標，將此等性能各異之兵器所具有之能力，加以擊滅，當使用之時，必須有極周密之計劃，與巧妙之運用。惟無論飛機或船艦，若將其偉大之行動力命令，各自發動，選擇適當之時機，殊難一朝一夕所能將事，因之此等實由艦隊長官掌握一切艦隊，開始砲擊之命令，亦根據艦隊長官之發令，故艦隊長官始終臨陣指揮。例如計劃日本海海戰時，東鄉長官立於艦隊最前端之三笠艦艦橋上，左手握軍刀，注視敵艦隊之動靜，目前對於艦隊不能以目力明瞭共動態時，則可依組發達之通信力，至於把握戰機，則在速力愈　增大之今日，誠須取決於俄頃之間，至如根據幕僚之獻言，始行命令行動者，　將不爲也。</p>
<p>如上文所述，當日本海海戰時，在敵前發表命令使作一百六十度之大轉同時，東鄉長官僅動其左手，由此可知把握戰機，實決定於一瞬之間。</p>
<p>余任大尉時，曾聞某提督已受聯合艦隊長官之內定，但即行辭退，其理由蓋因目力不佳，不能任海上之提督，因任海上長官者，必須能將距離甚遠之敵艦行動，判斷於俄頃之間，不能根據幕僚之獻言，始行操縱艦隊，今因缺乏自信，因此提出辭任。艦隊長官責任之如何重大，可想而知。秋山中將（日本海海戰時之艦隊首席參謀）曾關於該海戰發表稱：日本海海戰勝利之原因，全係日皇之天威，但參加各艦隊全軍之協同動作進行，的確至爲自然，躉在此戰，乃無所謂名利，亦無所謂勇功之戰也。無人不致其勇功，無人不發揮其智力，海戰實爲一「協同動作」，各人均充分發揮所有之技能與天分，一絲不紊進行協同作戰，始克完成大勝。</p>
<p>將此種協同動作統率爲如一人之行動者，即爲艦隊長官，此次戰爭，僅將聯合艦隊長官一人之姓名發表者，亦因此故也。茲關於臨陣指抓擊滅更述一例，當日俄戰爭時，旅順之二〇三高地，於明治三十七年十二月一日爲我方佔領，我海軍砲及陸軍榴彈砲，憑該高地將港內之敵艦隊全部擊沉，僅遺一艘，此一艘戰艦，係「塞伐斯特波蘭」軍艦，該艦逃往港外，敷設水雷，在離日艦甚遠處背山椗泊。當時聞波維的海艦隊已自俄關出發，向東洋航駛，而聯合艦隊則必須返國入船渠掃除或修理船底，但因尚有戰艦一艘，停泊旅順港外，殊難歸還，乃以水雷艇幾度向「塞伐斯特波蘭」作決死之襲擊。水雷艇之襲擊，係在夜間進行，艇長報告已聽得魚雷命中或爆發之聲，但日間該艦依然停泊故處，是否係被擊沉觸礁或被魚雷擊中，殊難明瞭，若不認明，不能歸還，必須加以確實認淸起見，束鄉大將乃親自加以觀察，乘龍田艦赴龍王塘望樓親自以望遠鏡觀望，認明確已擊沉，乃決定將艦隊駛同日本，東鄉元帥爲最信賴部屬長官，但當決定最重大之事件時，始終以自已之責任，加以決定。</p>
<p>就今日言之：所謂陣頭精神，已自束鄉長官以來成爲日本海軍之傳統精神。由在南洋前綫指導全般作戰中而於交戰飛機上壯烈戰死之山水元帥精神而觀，可見日本海軍艦隊長官之行動，如出一轍，吾人誠受無窮之敎訓焉。</p>
<p>（六）　結論</p>
<p>吾人每逢此光榮之海軍紀念，常將先烈之敎訓加以追憶與玩味。必須在服務之職位，加倍努力，凡吾一億國民，亦念茲在茲，在目前決戰時期，舉一億一心之總力，從事生產，較今日必勝不敗之形勞，更進一步，非擊滅英美不可云。</p>

<h3>吉田大將演詞要點</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊司令長官吉田大將，於昨第三十八次海軍紀念日，下午六時半出席日總力報國會假座日本俱樂部舉行之宴會，並發表演說，追憶日本海海戰之大勝，披瀝大東亞決戰下國民之決心，與駐華艦隊之牢固決意。此次爲吉田長官就任後第一次在公開席上發表演說，予各方以異常感動，茲誌演說要旨如次：日本海海戰之大勝，因以決定日俄戰爭之全局，亦爲帝國所以有今日昌隆之一重大原因，又無待詳述。三十八年來，因帝國國運昌隆，列國之嫉視壓迫，亦日見加厲，目前回顧當時抗拒列國壓迫之苦難歷史，加之現又爲在大東亞全域廣大戰塲進行膺懲英美戰爭之際，誠屬感慨無量，東鄕司令長官常日俄戰役後，曾在聯合艦隊解散之際發表訓辭，稱「若常奉體聖論，孜孜奮勵，蓄養實力以待時機，則庶幾得以完成永遠護國之大任。」日本海軍其後即承繼先輩之遺業，刻苦鍛練戰術充實軍備，潛心蓄養實力，前年大詔渙發，時機來臨，遂在御稜威之下，與陸軍緊密協力作戰，以充分完成護國之重任，余等於此次大勝之餘，對於導致日俄戰爭獲勝諸先輩之苦心，實不可忘。本日參加宴會之一賓中，有多位佩帶日俄戰役從軍紀念章，實表無限敬意。在一億國民舉國一致爲完成大東亞戰爭奮力邁進之今日，一重逢此意義深長之海軍紀念節，感慨無量。我國民須深切牢記此次大戰，實爲決定學國興廢，大柬亞隆簪之一戰，各位俱係後方之戰士，須引用三十八年前本日下午一時五十五分，宣戰命令下降後，艦隊將士奮赴之決心，越益奮勵努力，以擊滅敵人而後已。至帝國海軍在責任越益加重之今日，亦當上下一致，以上應聖旨，下順一億國民之期望。日前山本聯合艦隊司令長官在前綫壯烈殉國，凡我海軍，誠不勝哀悼，然前綫將兵之士氣，因此益旺，在卓絕古賀新長官之下，益將繼續猛門云。</p>

<h3>前日新閘區封鎖　查係謊報事實　拾荒者兜售廢銅　銅錫號鐵擊爆裂</h3>
<p>前日下午五時十分，派克路愛文義路二百零一號志誠銅錫號門首，突發生巨嚮，霎時濃烟密佈。經附近七六四號華捕報吿新閘警察署，派華探長楊培生等大批中日探員，馳往調查，得悉該爆裂者實爲一圓形之硫磺彈。據志誠銅錫號夥紹興人許涵卿，及其堂弟許涵祥同稱：頃間有一身穿藍布短衫褲，手携雨傘及飯具者，持該銅物向彼等兜售，因遭拒絕，乃取剪刀將銅物剪開，拋於門首而逃，而銅物亦即爆裂云云。探等據供，以顯係有人拋擲爆裂物，事體重大，乃轉報梅白格路日本憲兵隊，急發警鈴，會同保甲隊全體出動，將新閘區實施封鎖，嚴密搜索逃犯，一面將彈火撲滅，並將許氏昆仲拘入警察署偵査。直至七時許，許等始據實供明：該彈係於晨間九時，有一拾荒者持往兜買，以二元購下，置於桶中，至下午五時餘，彼等以不識何物，乃以鐵器擊之，不料即吿爆裂云云，探等以事實明瞭，封鎖亦即解除。但因許涵卿等不應以不實之供言，向捕房人員供述，致使出動許多人力，累及數千人受二小時之封鎖，情實可惡，飭令收押。昨晨解送第一特院刑二庭，捕房依誣吿罪起訴，請求嚴懲，詰之兩被吿供詞支吾，庭諭押候，定期六月三號宣判。</p>

<h3>經營工廠的要諦</h3>
<p>最近企業公司之業務，多數已感到有轉變趨向之必要，其惟一之方針，爲助長生產之發展。而經營工廠，尤爲助長生產之惟一途徑。經營工廠，應有五個要素：</p>
<p>（一）切合民生日川需要之工業品。</p>
<p>（二）原料易於取給，爲內地可儘量供應者。</p>
<p>（三）利用原有基礎，而加以合理之經營者。</p>
<p>（四）規模不取宏大，祇求內容充實。</p>
<p>（五）應羅政技述專家，寗缺毋濫。</p>
<p>同時金融界應儘量予眞心實力從事實業之各企業家以極大之幫助，以後放款，應對準工業進行。且須幫助合於標準之工業，尤其對於一般小工業，更須給以種種之利便，其標準如左：</p>
<p>（一）有完善之機械設備。</p>
<p>（二）有精良之工程師或技師。</p>
<p>（三）有完善之紙織，及優良之管理。</p>
<p>（四）其出品爲一般用戶所樂用，或風行各地者。</p>
<p>（五）內容充實，經理人確能埋頭苦幹者。</p>
<p>苟企業家與金融家認定上述方針，在工業上，作此遠大之計劃，則中國之企業，當有一新耳目之氣象。</p>
<h3>當局審議確定　國內物資交易計劃</h3>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股在盤旋中，升後忽回，乃新老投資者活動，爲求現之賣戶抵住也。終現升降不一。中法藥房及新亞藥廠始終在買戶搜求下，均已透出大關。百貨業之永安公司亦受買戶靑睞，反動上升，新新賣價喊上至關口，國貨公司獨平。紡織業之永安紗廠與美亞綢廠，在搜求下堅挺。公用業閘北水電與華商電氣價呆，成交淸稀·商務·中華·世界三書局乏人問津，價亦少變化。南洋烟公司突吿下挫甚勁。大中華火柴又爲提上；久安實業已見回升，其他雜色股，新益地產呆平；中聯電影少成交；中興木業。通易信託成交價較前市爲秀，景福衫襪允挺；中國鐘廠已跌至票面。</p>

<h3>值得重視的收繭貸款</h3>
<p>— 飛</p>
<p>養蠶是江浙二省農民最主要的副業，江浙二省農民在養蠶一項所獲得的收入，在他們每年的總收入額中佔相當的比例，不但如此，在事變以前，中國自有商品輸出入的紀錄以來，生絲一項的輸出，始終佔出口商品的前茅。所以蠶絲一項在中國國民經濟中所佔地位的重要，沒有人能加以否定罷</p>
<p>事變以後，生絲出口絕跡，中國蠶絲業陷於最衰落的境地。而國人之經營絲業者，以事實上種種窒礙，多數亦已另營別業。蠶絲一業，幾已被人造忘。隨着友邦對華新政策的展開，因統制辦法的緩和，頓呈活躍氣象。財界及絲業界集合鉅資經營蠶絲業者，據筆者所知，不僅有報上公開招股的中國絲業公司一家，計有四五家之多，規模均相當龐大，資力亦十分雄厚。最近報上復盛載各金融機關準備向絲業界貸款收買春繭的消息，這是一個可喜的現象。筆者認爲這在目前的意義的確太重大了。至少有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，現在政府當局不是正爲了抑低產價而澈查囤積嗎？金融機關不正在協助政府，或出於命令，或由於自動，在積極的收縮通貨嗎？這些收回的通貨，難道任其放在準備庫不想加以利用嗎？無疑的，他們正在考慮怎樣投放這些收縮回來的通貨。收買春繭貸款，正是投放這些通貨的最穏妥的地方，何况又大有裨於中國蠶絲業的復興呢？</p>
<p>第二，游資集中都市搜購物資，是目前上海物價騰貴的一個原因。把游資從都市流回農村，不但在抑平物價上。並且整個中國國民經濟的改組上，其意義的重大，與時期的迫切，就使不是經濟理論家和實行家，也總得承認吧！那末，貸款收買春繭，正是把游資從都市流回農村的最佳的機會。</p>
<p>第三，自從政府實施新經濟政策後，並雷厲風行的澈查囤積投機後，擁資者在都市已無出路。唯有向農村方面發展，不但解決了擁資者的苦悶，而且又可以掛上復興農村經濟的美名。自從事變以後，衣食住行中衣的一項，毛貨來源已吿絕跡，紗布的騰貴，竟與絲織品相差無幾，所以一般人都樂於採用絲織品，漂亮實惠，兼而有之。因此緣故，目前正是絲織品抬頭的機會，也就是復興中國蠶絲業之千載一時的良機。擁資者向這一方面謀出路，正是唯一的出路。</p>
<p>第四，事變以來，華中蠶絲業，幾全由華中蠶絲公司獨佔着。因國府參戰，友邦轉變對華政策後，在經濟方面跟着也有顯著的大改革。中國蠶絲業者，自然希望趁此時機，恢復原有的繁榮。可是他們根本沒有排斥華中公司的意義，相反的，中國蠶絲業者，正想借重該公司，共同復興中國蠶絲業。須知中國蠶絲業在中國民族資本中頗占重要的地位，該業人士本着復興中國經濟的自覺，正想在其岡位上有所貢獻呢？</p>

<h3>貧窮與卑賤</h3>
<p>— 王家杰</p>
<p>平窮與卑賤，相看好價有聯繫關係；但是却有明顯的不同。</p>
<p>平窮祇不過缺乏物質與金錢，在精神方面，一般曠達的人看來，似無多大影響；但一般心胸狹窄的人。就自怨自艾起來。他們以爲貧窮是羞恥的。這是錯誤。下面二則是衆人皆知的事：</p>
<p>「顏子當亂世，居於陋巷，一簞食，一瓢飲，人不堪其憂，顏子不改其樂。孔子賢之，」孟子離婁章。</p>
<p>「……環堵蕭然，不蔽風日；短褐穿結，簞瓢屢空；晏如也。……黔婁有言：「不戚戚於貧賤，不汲汲於富貴，……」陶潛五柳先生傳。</p>
<p>他們的一種安分的精神與樂天的態度，我們的確可以蔓傲。在貧窮中求快樂，我們的精神是純潔的。我們不必自怨自輕，去羨慕一般不道德而豪富的人，他們雖　有金錢，雖然物質的享受是豐富的，可是他們的精神未必愉快，未必　「貧中求樂」的人一樣。</p>
<p>卑賤，一般人以爲會隨貧窮而來。沒有了金錢，人格就卑賤有；了金錢，人格就高貴；這是現社會的偏見，是錯誤的。貧窮的人，不見會沒有羞恥和道德，但是所謂富貴的人，倒或許還有囤貨操縱舞弊私抬物價的舉動。（可說是奸惡的陰謀。）這可說是他們有道德和羞恥心嗎？我說這就是卑賤，就是心的羞恥。他們戴起處偽純的面具，去非議眞正高貴的人，這就是他們自居爲高貴榮譽的事，賢明的人們，當不難辨別眞偽。</p>
<p>所以我們在貧窮中，不必怨躉，祇須安分，在貧窮中丟找求眞正的愉快；亦不必羨慕人家舒服，因爲物質享受豐富的人，未必眞正愉快；祇須我們心地光明，沒有對不起人家的事，仰天俯地而無愧，那就是良好的國民。而一般以不道德致富的人，他們的精神是卑賤的，他們不配　一個良好的國民。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>看「迎春花」</h3>
<p>— 宗岳</p>
<p>滿映出品</p>
<p>導演：佐佐木康</p>
<p>主演：李香蘭</p>
<p>要看李香闌的時裝要聽李香闌的歌唱，這張片子準能滿足你胃口的。再如你要和你的「好朋友」增進一些情感。或素來愛看軟性片的話，這也正是你所需要的。</p>
<p>不懂日文不要緊，不「買」說明書也不要緊，不租譯意風也因爲我正是在不要緊這三「不」情形之下看的。片上說國語時你能懂，說日語時，旁邊竟有譯文一句句譯給你看、毫不隔膜費力說到此片的內容：</p>
<p>（一）編劇編劇很聰明，雖然脫不了三角戀家的故事，却能不落舊套。「嬌艷嫵媚，風情熱趣」，確能兼而有之。</p>
<p>（二）導演祗有幾幕溜冰場面，有些零亂，其餘均甚細膩。</p>
<p>（三）演員李香蘭的活潑美麗，溜冰歌唱，國語日語，在這裏是大獻身手了。也論演技，我却愛那飾村川武雄的大塊頭。他那慢吞吞不溫不火的態度，笑眯眯又態又妙的言語，眞引人忍俊不止。我疑心他本來便是一個樂天主義什麼都滿不在乎的傢伙。此外有許多國人飾演的配角，都很自然稱職，完全沒有美國片子中那種使人反感的地方了。</p>
<p>（四）音響普通，合乎水準。</p>
<p>（五）攝影沒及得上「母子草」那樣富有詩　了。但清晰美觀還夠得上贊一句。</p>
<p>（六）短片短片是東寶的歌舞片「蝴蝶美人」。主角便是那「新雪」裏的月丘夢路大體尙可，但含義很似嫌陳俗，音樂也有些刺耳。</p>

<h3>日本海軍異聞錄（四）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（五）另一個世界</p>
<p>現世的人—海軍中常稱陸上凡俗的世界爲現世—似乎知道潛水艦是非常刻苦的世界。而事實的確是非輕容易的。</p>
<p>艦長負起丁全部責任，航行中他是不上牀的，最多不過在司令塔內的椅子上打瞌睡。瞌睡的時候，祗要艦身有輕微的動搖，或是物件，空氣有響動，就立刻覺醒轉來，他的注意力沒有休息的時候。艦長以下的船員，祗要一個人犯了極微細的過失，就造成不能補救的重大結果，所以片刻也不敢懈怠。蹤令在長期間的忍苦而隱秘的索敵行動中，見到了敵人，而下了準備砲戰—浮上—的命令後，船員的一切行動，也被要求着須出於人類所可能的最大速度。在停止砲戰—急速潛航—的時候，甲板員也不從艙口鑽入艦內。僅把艙口轉落。於是裝填杖及別種鐵器等，就如彈丸般投向他們的頭上。此外，尚被困於狹隘，炎熱，忙碌，水的不足，空氣的不足，陽光的不足。</p>
<p>可是對船員們必須非常小心，不能使他們不高興。那就是說，不能發怒，一怒就完給了。乘員們首先須其有極大的自尊心。他必須有自信，有抱負，於是就有現世間所不知道的另一個世界的快樂。</p>
<p>第一種快樂是發見敵人的時候。自己所發射的魚雷，進向敵艦時，全體船員處誠地祈禱着等待結果。於是轟然命中的聲音，繼之格登格頓地敵艦在海中炸破的聲音。聽到這些聲音後的快樂，沒有別的可比喻。甚麼也忘記了。是人類歡喜的最高峯。</p>
<p>第二種快樂是艦尙完全融和，完全理解，互和信賴，結合成一個家庭。這不是外囊，不是隨便說的，偽善。與現實的性格相符合的，心與心之間的親切的結合。生死與共，所以不能有一個人發生不信任的意思這種自然而然的，不是吹牛的生活，似天國般清新而快樂。尊敬船員們的刻苦是應該的。可是在以偽裝與外表視爲正常的俗世間，至少在精神上是不爽快的。</p>
<p>（六）不足爲奇</p>
<p>某塵世的文人—感動癖頗強的文人，向某海軍士官這樣說：</p>
<p>「眞偉大啊：所羅門夜戰中，在夜襲戰動手以前。各艦們悠然如平常一樣訓練着。我聽了那話簡直只有感激……」</p>
<p>「啊！是這樣嗎？」</p>
<p>海軍士官淡淡地回答，對他的感激並不表示同感的意思。因此，那文士覺得非常掃興。蓋海軍中把那種場合的訓練並不以爲特別偉大。當作是稀鬆平常的事，不值得希奇。激戰之後，在掃除的時間，也心不二念地從車掃除。</p>
<p>就是日本海海戰，在獲得了那樣大戰果的翌日，屹然施行着像平時一樣的訓練。</p>
<h3>出征　（二）</h3>
<p>— 海軍報道班員　濱本浩著</p>
<p>「你一定知道吧，瓜島地形是特別複雜的。」</p>
<p>禿頭在香煙燻黃的中指上抹上殘餘啤酒，向棹子上畫瓜島的拋圖。</p>
<p>「當時我們部隊曾達到這個地方。有一天，本國的斥喉軍官曾來到此處。」</p>
<p>禿頭雖然伸出手指頭，但價啤在乎酒地圖上不想指着說明。</p>
<p>「是當時的故事，松則少尉離開部下正在站着小便。你是知道的，突然在不到十公尺的樹林中看見站着一個很高大的男人。那個人用手槍指着他，說給一支香煙。頗感物資缺乏的敵兵叫舉起手來。松　少尉大吃一驚，於是當然不得不停止小便，而靜待下文。但並不說自己平常流漓的英文，而只是靜靜地想。若是拔刀。當然敵人會開槍的，與強盜打當然已經立於不利的地位。又何況也許在周圍還有敵人，想到此處，便索性小便完了，甚至把褲紐開始扣上，是非常鎭靜的。」</p>
<p>近來在這一根據地，已經成爲無人不知無人不曉的有名武俠傳奇了。原來是這位禿頭報道班員當時曾隨着去過，他回來便傳播出去，宿舍中的同事不知聽他講過幾遍了，但大家從未聽壓，此次遠是有　大興味地都在聽他講述。</p>
<p>「從容地從衣袋中抓出櫻桃盒子來，松前少尉遞給敵人，敵人並不覺察他的惡意，而大胆地走來。松前少尉的左手突然把對方的手槍抓住了。用盡全生之力握住時，右手一揮便把刀拔出來了眞是說時遲那時快，敵人的殷紅鮮血冒出，而倒在地上死掉了。」</p>
<p>「你在傍邊看熱鬧了麼？」</p>
<p>身材短小而戴着特別大的眼鏡的同伴，半開玩笑地挿了一句嘴，但禿頭並不理他，仍然繼續着說：</p>
<p>「有興趣的還是那以後的故事。過了不多一刻工夫。松前少尉覺得在那個地方不好，便走開了。我忘掉說給敵人香煙的事。若是不給香煙而殺掉，那就有點騙人。覺得很不過意，便認眞地脫出他要給死人香煙吃去。大家都認爲是件危險事，所以都勸他不要去，但松前少尉很固持，一點也不聽。於是，大家無辦法，只好都準備好武器而隨他去了。」</p>
<p>禿頭一口氣說完，而接着便把殘餘的啤酒一口喝下去。</p>
<p>四砲台</p>
<p>費了半天功夫，在司令部把事情辦完後的松前預備少尉，滿頭大　地跑來。</p>
<p>江戶預備中尉說着「方才正聽到你的瓜島武俠傳」，現在正視地看一看老朋友的面孔。</p>
<p>「那個故事麼？早已過去了。」</p>
<p>松前少尉隨便這樣應付了一句，便坐在禿頭的傍面了。</p>
<p>「松前先生，昨晚碰到谷山少尉了麼？」這是面孔之一半被眼鏡遮着的報道班員說的。</p>
<p>「你是到砲台去了麼？」松前少尉這樣囘問。</p>
<p>「因爲月光好，當敵機襲來時，即毫無錯誤地馬上發見，我就去拍照高角砲和敵人作戰的像去了。」</p>
<p>「結果怎樣呢？拍得好麼？」松前少尉避樣問。</p>
<p>「不行。砲一射擊時傍面就起來一片塵土，是不能拍照的。可以說完全失敗了。」戴眼鏡的笑着，繼續說當時的故事。</p>
<p>「但因爲完全失敗，倒被谷山先生見笑了。」</p>
<p>「究竟怎麼一會事？」</p>
<p>「B十七號敵機降低高度，竟大膽地來用機關槍掃射。機關槍掃射這是不大好對付的，所以當時大家都喊防空洞在什麼地方？防空洞在什麼地方？而在頭上就有一個人喊叫。在砲台地方那有防空洞呢？若是怕機關槍就躲到砲彈倉庫去吧！這是用可怕而且高大的聲音說的。發這個聲音的原來是谷山少尉。他曾告訢我給你帶好」。</p>
<p>「谷山指揮大砲麼？」「平常究竟作什麼，我雖然不知道，更不過昨天晚上是指揮探照燈的。這眞是一伴不容易的任務。敵人的機關槍當然要集中這個地方射擊，倒不必說，你看就在傍面就有自己的高射砲陣地。何況海上的部隊也向此處集中射擊呢？高角砲彈的碎片在天空中炸裂後就像雨點般地落下來。就在這個槍林彈雨中，谷山毅然不動地指揮着。谷山少尉的身材很高，體格又魁偉，眞是很雄壯。那副情況，即將畫出畫來。」這樣說着，便對向美術班的油畫家。</p>
<p>松前少尉對江戶中尉說：</p>
<p>「谷山這個人，在高等學校，大學，砲術學校，一直都是和我同班，聽說他的父親作過很久的地方長官，可以說是名門子弟。」</p>
<p>「大學畢業的士官，也在這方面相當活動呵！」</p>
<p>江戶中尉只是經歷不同，因爲自己也是預備士官所以特別感覺興味。</p>
<p>在這個時候禿頭班員才注意到江戶的領章間說：「你是那一個學校畢業呵？」</p>
<p>松前少尉接過來囘答說：</p>
<p>「江戶因爲是畢業於高等商船學校，所以和我們的服務不同。好像是將在水雷艇服務的。」</p>
<p>「水雷艇，這眞是一件爽快事。江戶先生，你第一次上陣，祝你馬到成功。」南條報道班員含噓地笑着，撫摩了一下自己的禿頭。（濤：亦自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>女教員自盡案　各界紛表不平　要求法律制裁肇事家長</h3>
<p>（一）報載平涼路聖心小學校女教員，因責罰學生而引起家長赴校，始以辱罵，繼而歐打，以致該教員氣慣身死，令人不勝憤慨。際此物價高漲，生活維艱，各項職業中最淸苦者惟教師耳。然教師本着啓發民智之精神，終日循循善誘，教導兒童，造就人才，將來爲社會棟樑，國家柱石，責任之重且钜，盡人成知。詎知該家長竟不明事理，邈視師道，反加侮辱，鬧成巨禍，敎靑前途，奚看設想，試問子弟入學，最需教師嚴格管束，即使簿施夏楚，亦無反責之理，使觀學校當局在此糾紛之時，爲同袖手旁觀，更屬疑問。嗚呼！教育之保障何在，人命之輕賤可知，不禁爲孤苦伶仃之弱女子放聲一哭，此事想爲社會公理所抨擊，國家法律所制裁，定當昭雪於世間，決不含寃於地下！（問梅女士）</p>
<p>（二）蘇益之先生，因受學生家長毒打辱駡，含寃服毒，爲教育而殉難。吾等仝人聞之無不髮指。教育兒童乃教員之天職，雖適米珠薪桂之時，教員收入不能維持全家生計，但終末見生活不支而惰於教育者，每個教員本爲教育而教育之精神，栽培國家未來主人翁。蘇先生既爲人師表，敎育兒童責之所在，學生課本不能按時繳到，當然應受處罰，學生劉之俊既犯上規，理應制裁。教員果若不予迫究，乃教員之失。家長爲何不重責學生，反而聽信所言，大與問罪，侮辱教師。而家長既非草木。亦非冷血動物，豈能不辨是非，任意肆虐。此不啻吾整個教育界受其侮辱，仝人等祇因力量單薄，不能爲蘇先生伸寃，特此籲請社會人士及賢明之敎育當局全市學校爲之聲援。斯高中小學校全體教員謹啓。</p>
<p>（三）貴報載有辱死敎師新聞，請罷不禁髮指，教師之貴罰學生，本爲分內之事，學生家長何得加以干涉。今劉母對其子不加管束，而昂然住校中辱師，欺其孤苦弱女，竟至釀成命案，可恨可嘆。蘇君被辱後，其怨憤之氣鬱於胸，其呼天搶地之　蘊於心，以致於死，可謂慘矣。請賢明當局，不但令蘇君所需喪葬之費，申該家長全部負擔，且加以嚴厲之處罰，則蘇君雖含寃九泉，亦可稱暝目矣，且可以禁飭學生家長再有干涉校政行爲。（培鈞）</p>
<p>誌謝　昨承喬天慶君助器成小學周迅文君醫藥費百元，已遵示代辦，又承王星記扇莊交來邵連生君助難童教養費百元，已送中華慈幼協會。又承滬江小學全體師生合助三百元，當遵所囑分捐上海孤兒院，伯特利孤兒院，土山潛孤兒院，併代誌謝。</p>

<h3>The Mission of "Pro-Japanese Faction"</h3>
<p>Some time ago, in a discussion on the two types of pro-Japanese factions, it was solemnly pointed out that a truly pro-Japanese faction is not only urgently needed under the current circumstances, but also very necessary in the construction of the future new China and the construction of the new Greater East Asia order. Judging from past facts, while there are indeed many who have joined the pro-Japanese camp out of purely self-interested motives, the majority are those who embrace revolutionary, patriotic, Japan-loving, and East Asia-loving sentiments, and who, based on their lofty vision and outstanding spirit, step forward to engage in Sino-Japanese cooperative enterprises. The general populace, having endured much suffering in the past, certainly harbored feelings of deep pain and resentment towards the second type of pro-Japanese faction, the hypocritical ones. However, in recent years, the sincere efforts of the first type of pro-Japanese faction in seeking the well-being of the nation have gradually penetrated the hearts of the people. As long as they are not stubbornly prejudiced, everyone is beginning to understand and develop goodwill towards the first type of pro-Japanese faction. However, at the same time, we must recognize the complexity of Chinese social strata. Therefore, although participating in the ranks of the first type of pro-Japanese faction, holding the same goal of revolutionary national salvation and the belief in cooperating with Japan to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, each person's understanding and the steps they take may not be entirely consistent. Furthermore, the machinations of the second type of pseudo-pro-Japanese faction result in encountering some obstacles or causing unnecessary misunderstandings in all aspects of internal and external policies. For the sake of China's future, for the sake of East Asia's future, we deeply feel that every truly pro-Japanese individual must more accurately recognize the importance of their position in the current era and the arduousness of the responsibilities they bear towards their motherland and towards East Asia, and become more serious and proactive. We firmly believe that the following matters are worthy of deep consideration by every truly pro-Japanese individual, and should be pursued to achieve their realization.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the pro-Japanese faction itself, it is necessary to correct the perceptions of the Chinese people towards the pro-Japanese faction and to establish one's own credibility more firmly and broadly. This is the foundation for safeguarding all current internal and external policies. In order to achieve this, we believe that the steps that should be taken immediately include at least the following three points: First, in a passive sense, it is necessary to separate from the second type of pro-Japanese faction. Government leaders, on the one hand, must be vigilant and self-examine, and on the other hand, should pay attention to whether there are any members of the second type of pro-Japanese faction mixed in with their subordinates, and eliminate them. The success of any sound organization in the world inevitably develops through a difficult and arduous struggle. This struggle is not only external, but also internal. Taking the facts since the current war as an example, the Japanese government structure has been constantly refreshed and improved; and Nazi Germany's reforms of itself are progressing with each passing day. This kind of action is like epidemic prevention. By enduring temporary minor pain, we can prevent the occurrence of intense illness in the future. Second, in an active sense, it is necessary to strengthen ties and consolidate unity among genuine pro-Japanese factions, and to pay more attention to the education and training of cadres. We dare to assert that the soundness of the pro-Japanese faction itself is more effective than any external propaganda, defense, and other work. The final leaning of the people's hearts largely depends on this. This is the first point.</p>
<p>From the perspective of China's situation, the current mission of the first type of pro-Japanese faction, though complex and multifaceted, is simply to accelerate the concentration of national strength to assist Japan in winning the Greater East Asia War, in order to guarantee China's peace, independence, and free development. To accomplish this mission, the basic step is to promote China's comprehensive peace through political struggle. Because the resistance of the Chongqing communists, on the one hand, in the international sense, disrupts the Greater East Asia rear and restrains a portion of the Japanese army, which is a cause for rejoicing for the enemy. Under the responsibility of participating in the war, the pro-Japanese faction should first intensify political efforts to resolve the stubborn resistance of the communists. From the perspective of national interests, the failure to achieve comprehensive peace has led to the inability to carry out national construction, the stagnation of total mobilization, and the standstill of all political, military, economic, and cultural activities. On the other hand, it has dispersed national strength, making it difficult to restore vitality. Therefore, the promotion and implementation of the plans of China, Japan, and East Asia have been affected. Therefore, how to use political means to intensify the struggle to promote comprehensive peace should be the greatest task of the true pro-Japanese faction at present. This is the second point.</p>
<p>From the perspective of East Asian international relations, our country is today one of the three axis powers of East Asia, and also the main rear of the Greater East Asia War. As the world war develops, our country's position will become increasingly important, and our country's responsibilities will become increasingly arduous. As for our country's international relations in East Asia and in the world after the war, this is a question that every patriot must study first. Here, we must pay attention to at least the following points: First, in the past, we have only heard of Japan's China policy, but we have not heard of our country's Japan policy. This is a question worth raising from the standpoint of the people. As the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations and the development of international relations continue in the future, we demand that the government establish a Japan policy. This is also an important task for the pro-Japanese faction at present. Second, in the past, Japan's attitude towards the pro-Japanese factions in China is most worthy of study, and it is hoped that the Japanese side will fully recognize the different locations of the two types of pro-Japanese factions, so that Sino-Japanese relations can move onto the right track. Third, sufficient research and preparation should be made early for post-war Sino-Japanese relations, relations between East Asian countries, repatriation issues, and construction issues. This is what we expect of the true pro-Japanese faction. This is the third point.</p>
<p>We are today in the most serious international situation. Having a good policy outline is not enough for both internal and external affairs. The main thing is to rely on determination and practice. Therefore, the true pro-Japanese faction must, based on their sincere love for China, love for Japan, and love for East Asia, cooperate with Japan to solve the entire East Asian problems that have occurred and may occur, and seek the implementation of the national policies of China and Japan.</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War - Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpt (8)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that the responsibility of defending the Pacific in the future will entirely be the responsibility of Asians, and that the intrusion and aggression of British and American forces will no longer be tolerated. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on strong naval power. Our allied nation, Japan, has built its navy through decades of diligent effort and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it defeated the many with the few, initially showing its capabilities. In this Greater East Asia War, it has further displayed invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our allied nation, which is a difficult task, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have been unable to share the burden. Therefore, how we will emulate the navy of our allied nation to build a new Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is truly an effort that the people of our country should jointly and urgently pursue. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will excerpt and newly copy the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Under the Cooperation of the Navy and Air Force, Determined to Advance on the Path of Overcoming the Enemy — Broadcast by Yano, Chief of the Press Section of the Imperial Headquarters —</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. Rear Admiral Hideo Yano, Chief of the Press Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy Headquarters, on the occasion of the 38th Japanese Navy Day on the 27th, broadcasted to the entire nation at 7:30 PM via the Tokyo Central Radio Station, with the theme "Celebrating Navy Day Under Decisive Battle." The gist of his speech is as follows: "We celebrate this deeply meaningful Navy Day amidst the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. What is most unforgettable is the heroic sacrifice of Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, in April this year on the South Pacific Front, his sincere loyalty to the country, and his courageous spirit to defeat the enemy. The reason why the Japanese Navy under Marshal Togo Heihachiro achieved an unprecedented victory in the Battle of Tsushima was due to the sincere loyalty to the country of Marshal Togo and all the officers and soldiers, and their efforts to fight with the spirit of unanimously destroying the enemy. In the Greater East Asia War, our naval soldiers have been fighting day and night with their traditional spirit, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of Fleet Admiral Yamamoto. The heroic sacrifice of Admiral Yamamoto is sufficient to prove the glorious traditional spirit of our navy of 'commanders leading by example' and 'seeking to kill the enemy.' Looking at the current stage of the world war situation, we deeply feel that this year is a decisive year. Our country is now united with Germany, Italy, and other countries, with the rise and fall of the nation as the priority, exerting all our strength to confront Britain and the United States, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles. Since this spring, the Pacific war situation has seen fierce air battles between the enemy and us day and night. At the same time, on the 12th of this month, the U.S. military, under the cover of waterborne boat units and air force, landed on Attu Island. Currently, our garrison on the island is engaging in fierce battles with a small number of troops. This is because the United States has suffered repeated defeats since the start of the war and is therefore challenging us, seeking to gain a necessary base in the Pacific. The enemy's intention is to gradually advance its bases, expand the scope of its air control, to carry out naval decisive battles under air control, and to try its best to carry out air raids on our mainland. Our navy, in cooperation with the army, has been coordinating in the land, sea, and air, launching fierce attacks, destroying enemy bases, and constantly threatening their communication and transportation lines, achieving remarkable results. Furthermore, the United States is currently attempting to launch air raids on Japan from bases in Chongqing, watching intently for an opportunity to act, actively expanding the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. At the same time, the U.S. and British forces stationed in India are eager to recapture Burma and reopen the Burma Road, but because of the Japanese army's valiant operations, the British and American forces suffered a complete defeat in the Arakan campaign and ultimately failed to achieve their goal. The United States' target for aircraft production this year is 125,000 aircraft, including army, navy, and air force aircraft, and boasts that it can now produce 7,000 aircraft per month. On the one hand, it is mobilizing students across the country in an attempt to train a large number of flight personnel. As for the state of U.S. warship construction, there are a total of 827 ships and 3.39 million tons of shipbuilding plans, including the Third Vinson Act and the naval construction plans for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the First and Second shipbuilding plans established after the start of the war, which seem to be in full swing. The above-mentioned active strengthening of air power, sea power, and ships by the United States is intended to overwhelm Japan with several advantages. Japan is also prepared and fearless. If the enemy comes from the air, we will destroy them in the air. If they come from the sea, we will destroy them at sea. Therefore, we are determined to strengthen our air power, sea power, and ships. Various new aircraft, the crystallization of the people's hard work, have successively taken off, and new warships and powerful new vessels have also appeared on the ocean. Our only lesson now is to 'advance,' only to advance with the belief of certain victory. When Admiral Mineichi Koga received the great order to be Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, he declared to all the officers and soldiers under his command his determination to follow Admiral Yamamoto and other heroic spirits in heaven, to devote himself to completing the great task of protecting the country. Now the morale of the Combined Fleet is even higher, vowing to unite under the leadership of the new commander-in-chief to thoroughly destroy the enemy, thereby repaying the Emperor's grace. Now, in the autumn of a major war situation, we welcome this glorious Navy Day. Our navy vows to advance towards the path of destroying the enemy together with the entire nation."</p>
<h3>Aircraft Carrier's Active Role</h3>
<p>December 8th was a day that changed world history. Before dawn on that day, a large fleet of aircraft carriers advanced eastward, attacking Hawaii, annihilating the elite U.S. Combined Fleet, clearing the tools that harmed the entire Asian people, and illuminating the dawn of building East Asia.</p>
<h3>Warships Defending Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere we are building is the world's first treasure, accounting for the world's largest population and possessing the world's freshest culture. With a vast area, it relies entirely on the sea as a barrier, so it cannot do without large warships and a large navy. Fortunately, our East Asia already has Japan's ever-victorious, ever-conquering and great navy, which serves as our Great Wall.</p>
<h3>Suqing Rural Areas Donate Money to Purchase Aircraft; National Government Issues Order Commending</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. The National Government ordered (May 27th): Upon investigation, all sectors in the Suqing rural areas of Jiangsu Province supported the war effort by donating money to purchase aircraft. Previously, the governor of the province presented a remittance of 388,888.88 yuan and 8 jiao. It has been ordered to be verified and recorded. Now, the delegation representing the donation, led by Li Shiqun as the head, Huang Jingzhai and Yuan Shu as the deputy heads, Shi Xunqian as the general secretary, and Jiang Zhonglin as the deputy general secretary, presented a speech of donation and brought 1.12 million yuan in national currency. The total donation amounts to 1.50888888 million yuan and 8 jiao, requesting the purchase of aircraft, named "Suqing" and "Jiangsu" to assist in air defense. The head and deputy heads of the delegation promoted the grand plan, and the people of the Suqing rural areas of the province contributed their wealth to defend the country, which is truly commendable in loyalty and righteousness and worthy of commendation. This donation will still be transferred by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance for verification and collection, and will be notified accordingly. This order.</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Resolves to Change the Subei Military Headquarters to Pacification Commissioner's Office; All Counties in Subei Under the Management of the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. Yesterday (27th), the 16th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council passed important cases, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) The Chairman submitted for discussion, and the Secretariat presented a case. The Secretariat of the Central Political Committee submitted for inspection, and the Executive Yuan presented a case from the Ministry of Justice, stating that cases under trial in courts at all levels before the implementation of the Special Law on Wartime Housing Leases should be judged in accordance with this law. The case was submitted for review and approval, and the resolution was passed. Unresolved cases will be judged in accordance with this, but will not be retroactive. (2) The Chairman submitted for discussion, proposing to change the Subei Military Headquarters to the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office, and to return all counties in Subei to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, establishing the First Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province. The case was submitted for decision, and the resolution was passed. The Director of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office will be concurrently appointed by the Military Affairs Commission, and Zhang Beisheng will be appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office. The original Chief of Staff, Fu Shuangying, will be given another appointment, and the original Secretary-General, Zhang Mumin, will be dismissed. (3) He Tingliu, a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, was dismissed, and Huang Dazhong was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, serving in this capacity due to his qualifications as the Director of the Department of Education. Long Muxun was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram. During the 16th Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 27th, the Chairman's motion to change the Subei Military Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and to place the existing counties in Subei under the management of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, establishing the First Administrative Inspectorate, was passed. Political figures believe that this is a measure to separate military and political affairs and to strengthen provincial administration. The ten-odd counties in Subei are rich in products and have simple customs. Before the Incident, they were part of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's administration. After the National Government returned to the capital, given the importance of security in the area, and the fact that the provincial government's administrative power had not yet penetrated this area, the Subei Military Headquarters was established in 1941 to implement military and political administration. After the director of the Subei Military Headquarters, Zang Zhuo, was transferred, the secretary-general and chief of staff were responsible for military and political affairs. Over the past two years, security has been established day by day, and administration has entered the right track. All special circumstances no longer exist. Zhang Beisheng, the First Administrative Inspector of Jiangsu Province, was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the principle of unifying military and political affairs in the Subei region has been realized here. After the Military Headquarters was changed to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, with the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission personally serving as the Director, this point is particularly important from the perspective of national defense and security. After the establishment of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, there are already four offices under the Military Affairs Commission, including Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Kaifeng. The local National Army units and local security matters are naturally under the management of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. At the same time, the number of counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province has also increased, which can be regarded as a new contribution to the improvement of local administrative divisions. In addition, Huang Dazhong was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. Huang is currently the Director of the Department of Education of Hubei Province. It is natural for him to serve as a member of the New Life Movement Promotion Association in this capacity. Long Muxun was originally a professor at Central University and is a well-known youth leader.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th Telegram. The National Government ordered (May 27, 1943): The Subei Military Headquarters will be abolished immediately. This order. The Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office is established, with the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission concurrently serving as the Director for the time being. This order. All counties in Subei are returned to the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. An Administrative Inspectorate is established in Taixian County to oversee the administration of all counties in Subei, and is named the First Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province. This order.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Construction Plans Three-Year Program</h3>

The Ministry of Construction has recently formulated a three-year construction plan based on the actual situation, including three major areas: water conservancy, highways, and urban construction: (1) The purpose of the water conservancy aspect is to prevent floods, protect farmland, and increase agricultural production. The larger projects in the planned program include: (1) Opening up the new Subei Canal to facilitate irrigation, benefit, and increase cultivated land by as much as 5 million mu.

The Chongqing side hurriedly reinforced its forces in the Jinshi and Fengxian areas, but unexpectedly, the Japanese army turned to the south of Yichang and suddenly started an action to respond. The Japanese army, which had already occupied Yuyangguan and was advancing north from Changyang, lined up against the Chongqing army's resistance from the Yichang area at dawn on the 24th, forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, and quickly broke through the key points of Yutaishan (eight kilometers southwest of Yichang) and Luojiaba (ten kilometers southwest of Yichang) on the same day. It is still continuing to pursue. The 30,000 soldiers of the River Defense Army's 11th, 18th, and Provisional 34th Divisions, which the Chongqing side boasted were strong and elite, were in a state of collapse after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th, Central News Agency Telegram.

<h3>Promoting the Traditional Spirit</h3>
<p>— Colonel Kamata</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 38th Naval Memorial Day in Japan. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is achieving successive victories, its significance is all the more profound. Colonel Kamata, head of the press section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, delivered a commemorative speech at the Hongkou International Theater at 7:20 p.m. on the 27th. The topic was: "Promoting the Traditional Spirit," and he elaborated in detail on the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. The content of Colonel Kamata's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Today is the 38th anniversary of the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, when the sacred General Togo led our Combined Fleet to intercept and annihilate the Russian Baltic Fleet on the waters off Tsushima Island, not only creating a turning point for the prosperity of the Empire but also heralding the dawn of Asia.</p>
<p>At that time, the Z-flag, emblazoned with the words "The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle; each man must exert himself," was hoisted atop the mast of the flagship Mikasa. Unexpectedly, on December 8th of the year before last, it was hoisted again at Pearl Harbor. Since then, not only our fleet's officers and men but also all 100 million citizens of the Empire and the various ethnic groups of East Asia have forever beheld this Z-flag, proclaiming "The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle; each man must exert himself."</p>
<p>The belligerent nations, both sides, agree that these one to two years are the decisive period. But at this juncture, we must recall those days and commemorate the achievements of our predecessors. At the same time, we must strengthen our determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, and further overcome the many difficulties we will encounter in the future to build a glorious Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere without regret. I am truly honored to be able to express my commemorative thoughts today on this memorial day with the theme of "Promoting the Traditional Spirit."</p>
<p>(2) Promoting the Traditional Spirit</p>
<p>Since ancient times, in the East, there has been the saying, "The success of anything is not achieved in a single day." In the West, too, there is the saying, "The success of Rome was not achieved in a day." Every time I read history, I am convinced of the truth of this saying. Our Japan is now the most sublime and unparalleled nation in the world, admired by the people of all nations. However, this is not the result of one morning or evening's effort. Tracing back to the Imperial Rescript on Education bestowed by the Meiji Emperor, it states, "Our Imperial Ancestors founded the nation and established virtue on a grand and far-reaching scale. Our subjects should be loyal and filial, with hundreds of millions of hearts as one, generation after generation, to carry on this beauty. This is the essence of our national polity." He also granted gracious instructions, stating, "In the event of an emergency, you should bravely and publicly support the eternal imperial fortunes of heaven and earth." Therefore, we deeply recognize that the foundation is built upon the virtue of successive emperors and the traditional spirit built by our ancestors with loyalty and filial piety. Furthermore, today, we must engrave upon our hearts the loyalty of 100 million hearts as one, so as to support the eternal imperial fortunes of heaven and earth for all ages and in all places. At this historical turning point, with "Promoting the Traditional Spirit" as the theme, let us together recall the naval battle of the Sea of Japan and explain how the traditional spirit cultivated at that time can be further promoted and amplified in the current Greater East Asia War to provide reference material for everyone to adapt to the current situation.</p>
<p>(3) Lessons from the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan</p>
<p>The naval battle of the Sea of Japan was an unprecedented great naval battle, and its results were unparalleled. However, this victory is, of course, entirely due to the Emperor's virtue, which goes without saying. It was also the result of the officers and men of the Combined Fleet at that time learning from the Sino-Japanese War and, even earlier, from the lessons of our naval battles, and implementing them. Today, examining the eternally indelible lessons of war for future generations, I believe this is extremely meaningful. First: All the officers and men of the fleet deeply recognized that the rise or fall of the Empire depended on the sea. The sea is our nation's lifeline. To defend our glorious homeland, we must "protect the sea." The aforementioned point was emphasized by Admiral Togo when he disbanded the Combined Fleet. In his instructions to his subordinates, he stated at the outset, "We must be aware of permanently maintaining the gains after the war and further supporting the prosperity of the national fortune. Regardless of peacetime or wartime, we should take the lead in standing on the outer boundary, and the military should always maintain its strength at sea to respond to any emergency." This kind of awareness is the belief held by all naval officers and men today, and this belief must be maintained forever. Second: The spirit of resolute annihilation. When the Combined Fleet departed from Chinkai, Admiral Togo telegraphed the headquarters, stating in the first telegram: "Having received the alarm that the enemy fleet has been sighted, the Combined Fleet is immediately departing, determined to annihilate it. Today's weather is clear, but the waves are extremely high." From this, we can see the spirit of annihilating the enemy leaping from the paper. Only with this spirit of annihilation can we achieve victory in every battle. The spirit of annihilation and the belief in certain victory, although different in words, are the same in meaning. Our 100 million citizens, no matter what difficulties they encounter, must not allow this belief to waver in the slightest, then victory can be assured. Furthermore, with this belief, we will have the determination to die on the battlefield. The following two examples are the main reasons for the decisive victory in the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, and they are the most striking examples of the spirit of annihilation being brought into full play. (1) At 2:05 p.m., when 8,000 meters from the enemy, Admiral Togo suddenly and bravely decided to steer from a south-southwesterly course to a northeast-easterly course, turning about 160 degrees. (2) In the midst of enemy bullets raining down, he waited patiently without moving. Once the opportunity matured, he unleashed a barrage of fire. This kind of turning in front of the enemy was even considered the worst tactic during exercises. The enemy rejoiced, "Togo has made a mistake; we have won." Seeing the position of our ships, the enemy momentarily paused. At about 2:07 p.m., white smoke appeared on the enemy flagship "Suvorov," and at the same time, all the enemy ships fired simultaneously, with fierce gunfire. Near the Mikasa, which was standing on the front line, giant shells rained down, and the shadows of the ships were obscured by the shells and water spray. At this time, the Admiral still did not order to fire until about 2:11 p.m., at a distance of 6,400 meters, when he finally ordered "Begin firing."</p>
<p>In the four or five minutes between the enemy's firing and our firing, more than 300 enemy shells flew in, causing the flagship Mikasa to suffer slight damage before firing a single shot. However, the ship bravely endured. Our fleet's formation blocked the enemy fleet, concentrating fierce gunfire on the two foremost enemy ships, successfully forming a T-shape. The gunfire of our ships, trained fiercely on a daily basis, now demonstrated its effectiveness. In the following 30 minutes, the outcome of the naval battle was decided. Therefore, it can be said that the rise or fall, safety or danger, of the Empire depended on these 30 minutes. (3) Admiral Togo's attitude when the enemy ships surrendered. The Russian fleet, composed of eight battleships, nine cruisers, three coastal defense ships, nine destroyers, one auxiliary cruiser, six auxiliary ships, and two hospital ships, totaling 38 ships with a total displacement of 211,120 tons, was engaged in fierce fighting for two days and one night. We sank 19 of them, and the rest scattered and fled, or scuttled themselves. Many of the rest were detained by neutral countries and disarmed. Only one small cruiser, two destroyers, and one auxiliary ship escaped safely. Enemy Commander Rear Admiral Nebogatov led two battleships and two naval ships and, after enduring hardship, finally escaped to the vicinity of Ulleungdo Island on the morning of the 28th. However, they were still surrounded and shelled by our main fleet at that location, and finally lowered their naval ensign to indicate surrender. At this time, a staff officer on the bridge of the Mikasa, seeing this scene, exclaimed, "Admiral, the enemy has raised the flag of surrender. Please order to cease fire." However, the Admiral still did not issue the order to "cease fire." He said to the staff officer, "Although they have raised the white flag, the enemy ships are still accelerating, and their gun muzzles are aimed at our side. It is too early to cease fire." He continued to fire until he saw the enemy ships stop moving, and then he ordered to cease fire. If it is said that Admiral Togo was a cold and ruthless admiral, the fact is certainly not so. Admiral Togo was truly a marshal who grasped the essence of the spirit of annihilation, which is "not to rest until the enemy is annihilated." In the past history, we have repeatedly seen people who failed at the last hurdle. However, the nature of the Greater East Asia War is completely different. Our 100 million citizens of the Empire should thoroughly implement this spirit of annihilation and certain victory. As Marshal Yamamoto said, "If the United States does not make a vow of surrender in the White House, then we will never stop fighting."</p>
<p>(4) The Greater East Asia War and the Imperial Navy</p>
<p>The Z-flag that was last hoisted in the Russo-Japanese War was used at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War in the magnificent surprise attack operation on Pearl Harbor. This Z-flag not only indicates that the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is where the rise or fall of the Empire lies, but also that this war is a decisive and protracted war. During the duration of the Greater East Asia War, this Z-flag is truly an order that inspires and encourages our naval officers and men. Furthermore, our 100 million citizens, no matter what their occupation or what moment they are in, all deeply recognize their occupation. At that moment, everything is related to the rise or fall of the Empire. At that time, following the instructions of our ancestors, we poured all our strength into serving the public good and striving forward. Our naval officers and men always have a firm determination to establish merits even more excellent than those of our ancestors. We also hope to show future generations a model of glorious tradition and support the boundless imperial fortunes. The valiant attacks of the First and Second Special Attack Units in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor saw 60,000 rounds fired per minute, and torpedoes were used to sink the battleship "Prince of Wales," which was boasted as unsinkable, and the "Repulse." The fierce attack by the air force at the Battle of Malaya (December 10th) demonstrated the wonders of modern three-dimensional warfare. The surprise attack operation by the paratroopers at Menado (January 17th), the shelling by submarines far off the coast of California in the United States mainland (February 24th), the fierce attack at Midway (June 5th), the night attack at the Solomon Islands (August 14th), and the assault tactics in other air battles are all manifestations of the spirit of annihilation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, within a short period of time, the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, which were entrenched in the Pacific Ocean, were completely annihilated and eliminated. Their ambitions to cut off the Greater East Asia and oppress Japan were thwarted, and our country was able to freely roam the Pacific Ocean. From this, prosperity and growth have developed. As mentioned above, the Greater East Asia War, since the Pearl Harbor surprise attack, has undergone a series of operations such as surprise attacks, strong attacks, and assaults. However, the reason it has such a character is due to the promotion of the traditional soul of our military. The reason this traditional soul is produced is because it is the essence of our national polity, and because our navy often has to fight in an environment where it is outnumbered in naval battles. If we adopt a tactful strategy when outnumbered, it is difficult to win. However, merely adopting a suicidal strategy is not necessarily a victory. In modern warfare, which brings the full power of modern science into play, a blind kamikaze attack cannot succeed. This kind of kamikaze strategy must also be rationally planned and repeatedly trained. First, firmly believe that it will succeed, and then move forward. Admiral Togo said in his farewell address at the disbandment of the Combined Fleet, "God always grants victory to the army that is diligently trained and wins before the battle." The slogan solicited by the local naval association branch before this memorial day was "5-5-3 Monthly Gold Kamikaze Attack." Among them, 5-5-3 represents the ratio of the Japanese Navy to the British and American navies. Monthly Gold represents recalling the humiliating Washington and London treaties. With enmity and hatred, we engage in constant training every week, trusting in the divine skills we have acquired, plus a kamikaze attack. The glorious war achievements of our navy were created from this.</p>

<h3>Assuming Mediterranean Defense The Axis Air Force Is Formidable 370 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down This Month British and American Warships Congregate at Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - A special correspondent for the Maritime News Agency, Hoham Baek, quoted Italian sources as saying that the results of the air battles over the Mediterranean Sea and Italian airspace were quite satisfactory. The Axis air force continued its determination in the Tunisian War and gained greater operational independence and freedom in its new defense mission. The Axis air force no longer had to engage in the difficult task of aerial and maritime escort and enjoyed greater freedom, and had adapted its tactics to defense. Currently, bomber squadrons are used exclusively to attack enemy seaports in North Africa, while fighter squadrons are used exclusively to intercept enemy aircraft attacking Italian cities.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 26th: The Axis air force's achievements in the Mediterranean waters are as follows: (1) In May, the Axis air force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 370 enemy aircraft, most of which were four-engine bombers, so the anti-Axis air force lost at least 1,800 pilots or more. (2) In the recent two-day air battle over Sicily and the islands of Pantelleria, the anti-Axis air force lost 74 aircraft.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 26th: (1) The Italian naval torpedo squadron attacked an anti-Axis convoy on the Algerian sea, sinking two merchant ships and severely damaging many others. (2) The Axis air force bombed the port of Bizerte. (3) The anti-Axis air force bombed the city of Messina on Sicily on the 25th, causing heavy damage to the city center. (4) The Axis air force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 44 enemy aircraft on the 25th.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: When Italian aircraft raided the port of Bonne on May 24th afternoon, they caused considerable damage, and many enemy soldiers were injured and killed.</p>
<p>Algeciras, 27th (Central News Agency) - Spanish observers yesterday saw a large anti-Axis convoy pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, heading towards the Mediterranean. Among them were ships fully loaded with troops and military equipment, one of which was the 50,000-ton mail ship of the Cunard Line. The Gibraltar naval port currently has three British aircraft carriers, three battleships, twelve destroyers, eight gunboats, two American gunboats, and two British submarines. In addition, there is one American transport ship, one French transport ship, and three British transport ships.</p>
<h3>Veriki Luki Front German and Soviet Troops Engaged in Confused Fighting German Troops Improve Positions in Kupensk District</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the German and Soviet armies launched a major tank battle in the southwestern area of Veriki Luki on the central front of the Eastern Front on the morning of the 25th, it seems that they have completely fallen into a state of confused fighting. According to the German News Agency, the German army, unable to withstand the pressure of the numerically superior Soviet army, once retreated to new positions. After the arrival of reinforcements, they launched a fierce counterattack again on the night of the 25th. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses and retreated, and the three lost areas were completely recaptured. Furthermore, the German army north of Dmitrovsk in the Kupensk area launched a fierce attack on the 26th and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Soviet army. After a long period of fierce fighting, 400 Soviet troops were killed, and they were completely defeated. In this battle, the German army captured 600 Soviet troops, as well as two 7.62 mm artillery positions and a large number of automatic rifles and mortars, and the positions were also improved.</p>
<h3>Northern Front Operations Are Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: German military figures emphasized the importance of the German front line in Leningrad and the Soviet military objectives. They said that since winter, the German trapezoidal positions on the Eastern Front had repeatedly caused the Soviet attempts to fail. The current goal of the Soviet army is obviously to lift the threat to Leningrad, but in reality, the scope of their plan is much broader. The Soviet side wants to break through the German front line between Volkhov and Peipus, so that it can enter Estonia, reopen the Gulf of Finland, cut off the connection between the Finnish and Norwegian fronts and the German army on the Eastern Front, and establish contact with the United Kingdom through Scandinavia. When the battle near Lake Ladoga on March 25th came to an end, the German army in the area once again defeated all Soviet attempts. The only gain for the Soviet army was a small piece of land as a point of contact with Leningrad, but the price paid was extremely high. Now that all supplies can be transported to Leningrad via Lake Ladoga, this small corridor is of little use. During the Lake Ladoga battle, the German army had to fight simultaneously on the two northeastern fronts. As a result, the Soviet side suffered a total of one million soldiers killed and wounded and lost a large number of military supplies. In order to maintain this front line, the German army fought in extremely difficult circumstances, because the area is densely forested, has many swamps, and is infested with mosquitoes and flies. The German army had to put down their weapons at any time and use axes and hoes to open roads. The German army was assisted in the battle by the Spanish Volunteer Division and volunteers from Estonia, Latvia, and the Netherlands. It should be known that the victory or defeat of this battle cannot be decided by the gains or losses of one place, but by continuously annihilating the enemy until they are completely exhausted.</p>
<h3>Famous German Air Force General Killed in Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German military headquarters announced yesterday that German Air Force General Waldau was killed in a plane crash while inspecting the defense zone.</p>
<h3>Luo-Qiu Talks Have Now Reached the Final Stage Stalin Receives Davies Again</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington sources: The Luo-Qiu conference has reached the final stage and continued to be discussed on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Swedish journalists in London, people in London are impatiently awaiting the final communique of the Luo-Qiu Washington conference and are speculating about whether this communique will be the beginning of an anti-Axis offensive. According to a reporter from the Swedish News, the communique will only be released after British Prime Minister Churchill returns to London, which suggests that Churchill may already be on his way home.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Political circles in Berlin declared that Churchill's remarks to the Washington press were sufficient to show that he was doing his best to cater to the American public. The United Kingdom and the United States have always considered the European theater as the most important, and have considered the Pacific front as less important. The United States has recently begun to oppose this, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, Churchill had to reiterate the equality of the European front and the Pacific front in order to appease American public opinion. American public opinion is horrified by the command of the war and has criticized the attitude adopted by the British government.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio: Stalin met again yesterday with U.S. President's Special Envoy Davies, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present. The details of the matters discussed are unknown.</p>
<h3>Important Personnel Changes</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency) - There have been important changes in the personnel of the British Ministry of Production recently. Sir Layton, the chief planning advisor of the ministry, will resign at the end of this month, and will also resign from his concurrent position as the leader of the Joint Wartime Production Office. The vacant position will be succeeded by Sir Sinclair, the production department official and British representative of the Joint Production Resources Committee in Washington. The vacant official position will be filled by Sir Selpho, the permanent secretary of the ministry. Layton's resignation has attracted general attention in London, because he has served since the ministry was founded. Layton is also a director of the London Chronicle and was the editor of "The Economist" monthly for 17 years.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Spreads in the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - Washington: Labor unrest in the United States is still spreading, and several factories have recently gone on strike. 50,000 workers in the three major rubber factories in Akron and Barberton have gone on strike to protest the decision of the Wartime Labor Board and have ignored the War Department's request to resume work, so rubber production has come to a standstill. Furthermore, transportation workers in Akron went on strike due to participation in a labor conference, making traffic in the city more difficult. 12,000 workers at the Connor Wheel Factory expressed dissatisfaction with the factory's promotion of several female workers and went on strike. In addition, thousands of workers in the states of Cleveland, Ohio, and Wisconsin have also gone on strike. Public transport workers in Utica, New York, have also gone on strike, and almost all city traffic has been disrupted.</p>
<h3>Promoting Traditional Spirit</h3>
<p>— Colonel Kamata</p>
<p>(Continued from Second Edition)</p>
<p>We often experience these teachings, whether it be the production war that is currently causing a great stir, or the trivial daily tasks, we must apply rational, thorough, and meticulous planning, repeated training, and when implementing it, show a spirit of bold and courageous breakthrough, then we firmly believe that everything will surely be accomplished. The valuable lessons learned from the actual combat experience must be fully savored and not ignored.</p>
<p>(5) Marshal Yamamoto's Death in Battle</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on May 21st, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that Admiral Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, died valiantly in action on his plane in the foremost southern battle line. We soldiers, of course, and even the hundred million citizens, are overcome with grief and find it hard to express.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, General Yamamoto, under a grand and unparalleled plan, commanded the Combined Fleet and directed operations. For the past year and a half, with the blessing of the Emperor and close cooperation with the Army, he established an invincible posture and built great achievements that will never fade throughout the ages. This is something deeply known by people at home and abroad and needs no further elaboration.</p>
<p>Our naval officers and men will continue Admiral Yamamoto's legacy, fight with common hatred against the enemy, and further unite in their determination to annihilate the British and Americans, in order to reassure the Emperor. This point has been clarified by Navy Minister Shimada in his statement. The traditional spirit of the Iron Wall-like Imperial Navy will not be shaken in the slightest.</p>
<p>The heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto further enhances the glory of our navy. Until the British and Americans are defeated, this kind of self-sacrificing warfare will never cease. Moreover, General Koga, who is deeply familiar with the local conditions, has already, with firm determination and far-reaching plans, taken on the responsibility of commanding the front lines, following the footsteps of the deceased Marshal.</p>
<p>Next, I will briefly elaborate on the heavy responsibilities borne by the commander of the Combined Fleet:</p>
<p>There are many types of ships and aircraft participating in the operation. Ships include battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, each with different capabilities. Aircraft also have fighters, bombers, reconnaissance planes, and attack planes, each with different capabilities. To concentrate on targets and use the capabilities of these different weapons to destroy the enemy, a very careful plan and skillful application are necessary when using them. However, regardless of aircraft or ships, if their great mobility is commanded and each is launched separately, it is difficult to seize the appropriate opportunity overnight. Therefore, these matters are entirely under the control of the fleet commander. The order to commence shelling also comes from the fleet commander. Therefore, the fleet commander is always present to command. For example, when planning the Battle of Tsushima, Admiral Togo stood on the bridge of the Mikasa, the flagship at the forefront of the fleet, holding his military sword in his left hand, watching the movements of the enemy fleet. When the movement of the fleet could not be clearly seen by the eye, he could rely on advanced communication methods. As for seizing the opportune moment, in today's world where speed and power are greatly increased, it truly depends on a matter of moments. As for ordering action based on the suggestions of staff officers, this would not be done.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, during the Battle of Tsushima, when issuing the order to make a 160-degree turn in front of the enemy, Admiral Togo only moved his left hand. From this, it can be seen that seizing the opportune moment is determined in an instant.</p>
<p>When I was a lieutenant, I heard that a certain admiral had been internally designated as the commander of the Combined Fleet, but he immediately resigned. The reason was that his eyesight was not good, and he could not serve as an admiral at sea. Because a naval commander must be able to judge the movements of distant enemy ships in an instant and cannot manipulate the fleet based on the suggestions of staff officers. Because he lacked confidence, he submitted his resignation. The magnitude of the responsibility of a fleet commander is imaginable. Vice Admiral Akiyama (chief staff officer of the fleet during the Battle of Tsushima) once commented on the sea battle: The reason for the victory in the Battle of Tsushima was entirely due to the Emperor's majesty, but the coordinated actions of all the fleets participating were indeed very natural. This battle was not about fame or fortune, nor was it a battle for personal valor. Everyone contributed their courage, and everyone demonstrated their intelligence. The sea battle was truly a "coordinated action." Everyone fully utilized all their skills and talents, and coordinated operations were carried out without a single error, and thus a great victory was achieved.</p>
<p>The one who leads this kind of coordinated action as if it were the action of one person is the fleet commander. The reason why only the name of the commander of the Combined Fleet was announced in this war is also for this reason. Now, I will give another example regarding seizing the opportune moment to strike. During the Russo-Japanese War, 203 Meter Hill in Port Arthur was occupied by our forces on December 1, 1904. Our naval guns and army howitzers used the height to sink the entire enemy fleet in the harbor, leaving only one ship. This warship was the battleship "Sevastopol." The ship fled outside the harbor, laid mines, and anchored with its back to the mountain, far away from the Japanese ships. At that time, it was heard that Rozhestvensky's fleet had departed from Russia and was sailing towards the East, while the Combined Fleet had to return home to enter the dock to clean or repair the bottom of the ships. However, because there was still one battleship anchored outside Port Arthur, it was difficult to return. Therefore, torpedo boats made several desperate attacks on the "Sevastopol." The torpedo boat attacks were carried out at night. The captain reported that he had heard the sound of a torpedo hitting or exploding, but during the day the ship was still anchored in place. It was difficult to determine whether it had been sunk, run aground, or hit by a torpedo. If it was not confirmed, it could not return. In order to make sure it was confirmed, Admiral Togo personally observed it. He went to the Dragon King Pond watchtower on the Tatsuta and personally observed it with a telescope. He confirmed that it had been sunk and decided to sail the fleet back to Japan. Admiral Togo was the most trusted subordinate officer, but when deciding on the most important events, he always made the decision with his own responsibility.</p>
<p>Speaking of today: The so-called spirit of the front lines has become the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy since Admiral Togo. From the spirit of Admiral Yamamoto, who died valiantly in combat on his plane while directing overall operations on the South Pacific front, it can be seen that the actions of Japanese naval fleet commanders are all of a piece. We are truly receiving endless teachings.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>Whenever we celebrate this glorious Navy Day, we often recall and savor the teachings of the fallen heroes. We must redouble our efforts in our service positions. All one hundred million of our citizens must also keep this in mind. In the current decisive battle period, we must use the total power of one hundred million hearts and minds to engage in production, and further improve the current shape of certain victory and invincibility. We cannot say it is enough unless we defeat the British and Americans.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was Japanese Navy Day Held Grand Celebrations Raised Warship Flags and Solicited National Defense Donations Banquet Celebrated Merits and Held Public Assembly</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the actual day of the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, and Japanese officials and civilians in this city held grand celebrations. Thirty-eight years ago, Japan used its newly created navy to annihilate the powerful Imperial Russian fleet in one fell swoop. The date was May 27, 1905. Since then, celebrations have been held on this day every year. This year is the 38th anniversary, and the second time to commemorate Navy Day since the start of the East Asia War. Now that good news is frequently reported, the entire nation of Japan is filled with joy beyond measure, and the naval authorities and tens of thousands of expatriates in Shanghai are especially excited. The commemorative program began on the 21st. The situation yesterday was even more enthusiastic. There are still commemorative programs for the next two days.</p>
<p>Raising Warship Flags and Soliciting National Defense Donations</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:30, Japanese expatriates, under the guidance of naval officials, gathered at the Shanghai Shrine to hold a raising ceremony for the warship flag and the Z flag. The Z flag was used by Commander Togo during the Battle of Tsushima to encourage his subordinates, indicating that the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire depended on this battle. The flag was raised high to boost morale. After the raising ceremony, members of the Japanese Women's Patriotic Society began to solicit donations on various important streets. The workers all wore white belts on their chests with the fundraising mark of the Patriotic Women's Society written on them. Donors were very enthusiastic, and all proceeds were used as national defense donations.</p>
<p>Opening Celebration Banquet and Holding Conference</p>
<p>In addition, 1,500 fifth-grade students from various Japanese national schools in this city went to the Izumo warship to observe the lives of naval soldiers. From 6:30 PM, the Total Strength Patriotic Association held a naval celebration banquet at the Ponglu Japanese Club. At 7:00 PM, a military music, speech, and film conference was held at the Hongkou International Theater, attended by 2,000 people. The speaker was Colonel Ide, director of the Fleet Press (the full text of the speech is on pages 2 and 3). The Fleet Military Band performed on the scene, and the films included "Japanese News," "Shanghai Marine Corps," and "Naval War Chronicles," which were screened simultaneously with the Imperial City of Kyoto.</p>
<p>Shanghai Radio Broadcast Program</p>
<p>To celebrate Japanese Navy Day, Shanghai Radio broadcast a special music program from 9:10 PM to 9:30 PM last night (27th). The program featured performances of the accordion and harmonica by Shi Renwang and Shi Hailun. The detailed program included "Defending the Pacific," "Destruction of the British East Indies Fleet," "March of the Sea," "Pacific March," "Great Battle of Hawaii," "Warship March," and "Victory Song of Korea." It is learned that Fleet Press Director Colonel Kamata will be invited to give a speech from 10:10 PM to 10:40 PM tonight.</p>
<p>Boat Race and Armed Relay Race Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>The commemorative activities for Navy Day will end on the evening of the 30th.

The winner will receive the victory flag presented by Commander Yoshida, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Key Points of General Yoshida's Speech</h3>
<p>Admiral Yoshida, commander of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, attended the banquet held by the Japan Total Strength Patriotic Association at the Japanese Club at 6:30 PM yesterday, the 38th Navy Day, and gave a speech, recalling the great victory of the Battle of Tsushima and expressing the nation's determination in the Great East Asia Decisive Battle, and the firm resolve of the fleet stationed in China. This was the first public speech given by Admiral Yoshida since taking office, and it gave everyone an extraordinary feeling. The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: The great victory in the Battle of Tsushima determined the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War and was a major reason why the Empire has its prosperity today. There is no need to elaborate further. Over the past 38 years, as the Empire's national fortune has flourished, the jealousy and oppression of other countries have become increasingly severe. Looking back on the difficult history of resisting the oppression of other countries at that time, and now being in the midst of a war to punish Britain and the United States in the vast theater of the Greater East Asia region, I am truly filled with emotion. Commander Togo often gave instructions at the time of the dissolution of the Combined Fleet after the Russo-Japanese War, saying, "If we always follow the Emperor's words, diligently strive, and accumulate strength to await the opportunity, then we can almost complete the great task of protecting the country forever." Afterwards, the Japanese Navy inherited the legacy of its predecessors, diligently trained in tactics, strengthened its military preparations, and secretly accumulated strength. When the Emperor's Edict was issued the year before last, the opportunity came, and under the Emperor's authority, it closely cooperated with the Army in combat to fully complete the heavy responsibility of protecting the country. In addition to this great victory, we must not forget the painstaking efforts of the predecessors who led to the victory in the Russo-Japanese War. Among the guests participating in today's banquet, there are many who wear Russo-Japanese War medals, and I express my infinite respect to them. Today, when one hundred million citizens are striving to complete the Great East Asia War, it is an event filled with emotion to once again encounter this deeply meaningful Navy Day. Our people must deeply remember that this war is truly a battle to determine the rise and fall of our country and the rise of East Asia. You are all soldiers in the rear, and you must use the determination of the fleet generals and soldiers who fought at 1:55 PM on this day 38 years ago after the declaration of war was issued, to work even harder and strive to destroy the enemy before it is over. As the responsibility of the Imperial Navy becomes increasingly heavy today, we must also unite from top to bottom, respond to the Emperor's will, and meet the expectations of the hundred million citizens. The other day, Admiral Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet, died valiantly at the front, and all of us in the Navy are filled with sorrow. However, the morale of the front-line soldiers has therefore increased, and under the leadership of the brilliant new commander, Koga, we will continue to fight fiercely.</p>

Police agencies in the capital and various provinces and cities will, in consideration of the actual situation, transfer officers of the rank of appointee and above from their subordinates, as well as chiefs and section chiefs of police stations in various counties, according to the quota for training for a period of one month.

<h3>The Case of a Female Teacher Being Insulted to Death is Scheduled to Be Tried The Municipal Education Association Sends Personnel to Express Condolences Coffin Expenses Are Not Yet Settled and Assistance Is Needed</h3>
<p>The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road, who was beaten and insulted to death by Liu Wangshi, a family member of a student, is in the custody of the autopsy office on Hart Road. The forensic doctor examined the body at 11:00 AM yesterday. The forensic doctor had not yet tested which poison she had taken, so he specially took out the deceased's internal organs for research. The family has moved the body to the Xijin Guild Hall on Haining Road. According to the family, the coffin was borrowed from a coffin shop near the school, and the coffin expenses have not yet been settled. The case is scheduled to be heard in court on June 2.</p>
<p>Zhou Hualian Publicly Issued a Statement</p>
<p>Zhou Hualian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Education Association, issued a statement: It is regrettable that this case occurred. In this extraordinary period, teachers in this city are enduring hunger and cold to serve education, and their situation is already extremely pitiful. Unexpectedly, Teacher Su was unexpectedly beaten and insulted while performing her duties, and her situation was even more embarrassing. She was forced by the environment to commit this negative act of suicide, and its stimulation to the education community is even greater. It is hoped that as a result of this case, the school authorities and students' parents will cooperate more closely, so that family education and school education can quickly become one. Schools should give timely guidance to students' personality, behavior, and homework, so that they can correct themselves automatically, and parents should especially understand the school's painstaking efforts in cultivating talents and pay respect to the hard work of teachers. In this way, the style of "respecting teachers and valuing morality" can be seen again in today's society, and similar incidents will not happen again. In addition, the association specially sent Section Chief Chen to visit the family yesterday. The Shanghai Special City Women's Association also expressed its sympathy and is making a righteous appeal to all parties.</p>
<p>Letters and Donations from All Walks of Life to Express Condolences</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of this case, this newspaper has received letters from readers and designated donations to express condolences. Those received yesterday included Mr. Lin Junyi, 50 yuan; Zhong En and Xu Zichang, 20 yuan each; Pu Qiting, 10 yuan, for a total of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Chartered Rice Shops Received Purchase Orders Yesterday The Household Ration Amount for the 37th Period is Two Sheng of Polished Rice and One Jin of Flour</h3>
<p>The 665 chartered rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession received the household ration purchase orders for the 37th period from the Distribution Office of the Materials Control Department of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, paid the money immediately, and picked up the goods from the designated warehouse, and were allowed to purchase them from June 2nd with the rice purchase certificate and the flour certificate, effective until June 9th.

The combination for the next period is two sheng of polished rice, selling for 6 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. One city jin of flour, selling for 4 yuan and 9 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates. However, the above quantities and prices are subject to the official announcement of the authorities.</p>

The warehouse receipts have also been issued, and the office has begun to process the procedures for picking up the goods. It was originally scheduled to be sold universally at the end of this month. According to the person in charge of the group speaking to the reporter: Because there is still a portion of edible oil that will have to wait until the 29th to pick up the goods, it was not possible to sell it as scheduled. It will be sold universally on the 2nd and 3rd of next month. As for the various methods, they are still the same as in the past.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Line Fares Will Be Adjusted Next Month It Is Forbidden to Sell Ship Tickets at Inflated Prices Wansheng Operated by Wanji</h3>
<p>Due to the disparity in prices between Shanghai and Ningbo, the single-gang merchants on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are quite active. Although there are four ships, Xinning Shao, Changshan, Wansheng, and Hualin, traveling back and forth, it is still difficult to purchase ship tickets for those who need to return to their hometowns for business. In view of this, the authorities have specially adjusted the Shanghai-Ningbo ship fares and strictly prohibit selling them at inflated prices. At the same time, the passenger ticket offices are ordered to strictly prevent the activities of "ticket scalpers." The newly revised fares that will be implemented from June 1 are recorded as follows: The Xinning Shao ship has a total of four types of cabins: (First Class) 189 yuan, (Second Class) 116.5 yuan, (Third Class) 72 yuan, (Fourth Class) that is, the steerage cabin, 33.5 yuan. Changshan ship (First Class) 161 yuan, (Second Class) 72 yuan, (Third Class) 58.5 yuan, (Fourth Class) 32.5 yuan. The new fares will be implemented starting from the 15th voyage of the Xinning Shao to Ningbo on June 1. The Wansheng ship will be docked for repairs until the end of this month, and the Wanji, which is about to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, will depart. Its cabins are (Special Class) 29 yuan in military tickets, (First Class) 21 yuan in military tickets, (Second Class) 17 yuan in military tickets, (Third Class) 13 yuan in military tickets, and (Fourth Class) 6 yuan. The fare of the Wanlin ship is the same as that of the Wanji, but the Hualin also goes to Wanshi Pu, and its Wanshi Pu fare will remain the same for the time being. Future changes have not yet been decided. (The above fares do not include meal money.)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Christian Association Responds to the Relief of the North China Famine It is Scheduled to Promote a Fundraising Campaign with a Provisional Goal of 500,000 yuan</h3>

<h3>The Sealing of the Xinzha District the Day Before Yesterday Was Found to Be a False Report A Scavenger Was Peddling Scrap Copper The Tongxi Co.'s Iron Strike Caused an Explosion</h3>
<p>At 5:10 PM the day before yesterday, a loud noise suddenly occurred in front of No. 201 Pike Road and Avenue Haig, the Zhicheng Copper and Tin Co., and thick smoke filled the air in an instant. After being reported by Huabao No. 764 nearby to the Xinzha Police Station, a large number of Chinese and Japanese detectives, including Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng, rushed to investigate and learned that the exploding object was actually a circular sulfur bomb. According to Xu Hanqing, a Shaoxing native and employee of the Zhicheng Copper and Tin Co., and his cousin, Xu Hanxiang, a man wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, carrying an umbrella and a rice container, approached them to sell the copper object. When they refused, he took a pair of scissors, cut the copper object open, threw it in front of the door, and fled, and the copper object exploded immediately. The detectives, based on their confessions, believed that someone had thrown an explosive, which was a serious matter. They reported it to the Japanese Gendarmerie on Mei Baige Road, which sounded the alarm and dispatched all the members of the Baojia team to seal off the Xinzha District and conduct a strict search for the fugitive. At the same time, they put out the fire and detained the Xu brothers at the police station for investigation. It was not until 7:00 PM that the Xus truthfully confessed: the bomb was brought to them by a scavenger at 9:00 AM that morning, and they bought it for two yuan and placed it in a bucket. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they didn't know what it was, so they hit it with an iron tool, and it exploded. The detectives, realizing that the facts were clear, lifted the blockade. However, because Xu Hanqing and others should not have made false statements to the police, causing many people to be dispatched and thousands of people to be subjected to a two-hour blockade, their behavior was hateful, and they were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and the police charged them with false accusation and requested severe punishment. The two defendants stammered in their statements, and the court ordered them to be held in custody and set a date for sentencing on June 3.</p>

<h3>The Essentials of Factory Management</h3>
<p>Recently, many business enterprises have felt the need for a shift in their operations. The only guideline is to promote the development of production. Operating factories is the only way to promote production. There are five essential factors for factory management:</p>
<p>(1) Industrial products that meet the daily needs of the people.</p>
<p>(2) Raw materials are easily accessible and can be supplied as much as possible from the interior.</p>
<p>(3) Utilizing the existing foundation and operating it rationally.</p>
<p>(4) The scale should not be too large, only aiming for substantial content.</p>
<p>(5) Political and technical experts should be hired, valuing quality over quantity.</p>
<p>At the same time, the financial sector should provide as much sincere and practical help as possible to entrepreneurs who are genuinely engaged in industry. Future loans should be directed towards industrial development and should assist industries that meet the standards, especially small industries, providing them with various conveniences. The standards are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Having complete mechanical equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Having excellent engineers or technicians.</p>
<p>(3) Having perfect paperwork and excellent management.</p>
<p>(4) Its products are popular with general users or widely used in various regions.</p>
<p>(5) Having substantial content, and the manager can indeed work hard.</p>
<p>If entrepreneurs and financiers recognize the above guidelines and make such long-term plans in industry, then China's enterprises will have a new look.</p>
<h3>Authorities Review and Finalize Domestic Material Trading Plan</h3>
<p>In order to promote the smooth material trading between Central China, South China, North China, and Mongolia and balance demand, the national government authorities have finalized this year's material trading plan for Central China, South China, North China, and Mongolia. The plan has been reviewed and approved by the Material Control Review Committee. The material trading plan between Central China and</p>
<p>South China (Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen) involves close liaison between the two sides to adjust transportation issues. The South China side should strive to increase the transfer of materials from Central China to adjust the trade deficit. The settlement of exchange rates between Central China and South China should be based on the legal tender standard. Various places in South China should vigorously implement transactions with exchange rates for materials transported to Shanghai. As for Central China's trade with</p>
<p>North China, the trading plan is divided into specific material trading and general material trading. The distinction is that (1) specific materials are essential to ensure the supply of materials for important industries and food policies in the importing area. The exporting area should be responsible for supplying the agreed quantity within the agreed limit. (2) For the trade volume of general materials, only a considerable standard is agreed upon. Sino-Japanese commercial firms may strive to increase the trade volume as much as possible. The material trading products between Central China, North China, South China, and Mongolia are based on the production or needs of each region.</p>
<h3>Unrestricted Taxed Goods May Be Transported and Sold with Tax Payment Certificates</h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council has approved the establishment of the National Commercial Control General Association and formulated interim regulations and the Interim Regulations on Wartime Material Movement Control. The National Government has promulgated these regulations, which came into effect on March 16 of this year. In accordance with Article 5 of the Interim Regulations on Wartime Material Control, merchants and civilians transporting materials must obtain permission from the statutory agency. Article 6 stipulates that they must obtain permission from the National Commercial Control General Association and export permits from the Customs Office before moving. It is reported that other taxed goods not subject to restrictions may be transported and sold in various places by merchants holding various tax payment and transportation permits issued by the competent tax authorities in accordance with the regulations.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau Prohibits Rapeseed Exports</h3>
<p>Rapeseed in various parts of Jiangsu Province is now in season. Merchants from various places have sent personnel to purchase it in the producing areas. The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau believes that the province's production and sales of edible oil are seriously insufficient. With the approval of the Governor, the rapeseed produced this year that can be used for oil extraction should all be used to meet the needs of the province first, and is not allowed to be shipped out of the province. A notice has been sent to all county governments to comply with this.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read the news in the "Economic World" section of your newspaper stating that "Coal balls are not rising in price," which mentions that manufacturers can earn a net profit of over one hundred yuan per ton, I find it inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected to avoid misunderstandings. Regarding the news of coal ball price increases, our association has not heard of it. It is a rumor without any basis. Therefore, I am writing to inform you and hope you will correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Coal Ball Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Worthy of Attention - Silkworm Cocoon Loan</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Silkworm farming is the most important side job for farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The income farmers in these two provinces obtain from silkworm farming accounts for a considerable proportion of their total annual income. Moreover, since the establishment of China's commodity import and export records, silk exports have consistently ranked at the forefront of export commodities. Therefore, no one can deny the importance of silk in China's national economy.</p>
<p>Since the war, silk exports have disappeared, and China's silk industry has fallen into its most decadent state. Due to various practical obstacles, most Chinese silk operators have turned to other industries. The silk industry has almost been forgotten. With the unfolding of new policies from friendly nations towards China and the easing of control measures, a lively atmosphere has suddenly emerged. As far as the author knows, there are not only China Silk Industry Corporation, which publicly invites shares in the newspapers, but there are four or five more corporations engaged in silk farming with considerable capital.</p>
<p>Recently, the news that financial institutions are preparing to lend money to the silk industry to purchase spring cocoons has been reported, which is a welcome phenomenon. The author believes that this is indeed of great significance at present. There are at least the following points:</p>
<p>First, isn't the government currently investigating hoarding to suppress production prices? Aren't financial institutions assisting the government, either by order or voluntarily, in actively contracting currency? Are these recovered currencies to be left in reserve without being used? Undoubtedly, they are considering how to inject these contracted currencies. Silkworm cocoon loan purchase is the most stable place to inject these currencies, not to mention that it greatly benefits the revival of China's silk industry.</p>
<p>Second, the concentration of hot money in cities to buy materials is one reason for the current high prices in Shanghai. Returning hot money from the cities to the countryside is not only about suppressing prices, but the major significance of the reorganization of the entire Chinese national economy and the urgency of the times must be recognized by everyone, not just economic theorists and practitioners! Therefore, loan to purchase spring cocoons is the best opportunity to return hot money from cities to the countryside.</p>
<p>Third, since the government implemented the new economic policy and vigorously investigated hoarding and speculation, investors in the cities have no way out. The only way is to develop in rural areas, which not only solves the distress of investors, but also gives them the beautiful name of reviving the rural economy. Since the war, the source of wool goods has disappeared in the item of clothing in food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The high price of yarn and cloth is almost the same as that of silk fabrics, so everyone is happy to use silk fabrics, which are beautiful, affordable, and have both. Therefore, now is the opportunity for silk fabrics to rise, which is a rare opportunity to revive China's silk industry. For investors to find a way out in this direction is the only way out.</p>
<p>Fourth, since the war, the silk industry in Central China has been almost monopolized by the Central China Silk Company. After the National Government participated in the war and friendly countries changed their policies towards China, there have also been significant reforms in the economic aspect. Chinese silk farmers naturally hope to take this opportunity to restore their original prosperity. But they have no meaning to exclude the Central China Company. On the contrary, Chinese silk farmers want to use the company to jointly revive China's silk industry. It must be known that China's silk industry occupies an important position in China's national capital, and people in this industry are making contributions at their posts, based on the awareness of reviving the Chinese economy.</p>

<h3>Poverty and Meanness</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiajie</p>
<p>Poverty and meanness seem to be related; however, there is a clear difference.</p>
<p>Poverty is nothing more than a lack of material and money. In terms of spirit, generous people do not see much of an impact; but narrow-minded people will complain. They think that poverty is shameful. This is wrong. The following two examples are well known:</p>
<p>"Yanzi lived in a humble alley in troubled times, with a basket of food and a gourd of water. Others could not bear his hardship, but Yanzi did not change his joy. Confucius praised him," Mencius Li Lou Chapter.</p>
<p>"...The walls around him were bare, unable to shield him from the wind and sun; his short coat was worn and patched, his basket and gourd were often empty; yet he was content... Qian Lou said, 'I am not saddened by poverty and lowliness, nor do I eagerly seek wealth and status...'" Tao Qian, Biography of Mr. Five Willows.</p>
<p>We can indeed be proud of their spirit of contentment and optimistic attitude. Seeking happiness in poverty, our spirit is pure. We do not have to complain and belittle ourselves, and envy those immoral and wealthy people. Although they have money and material enjoyment, their spirit may not be happy, and may not be the same as a person who seeks happiness in poverty.</p>
<p>Meanness is generally thought to come with poverty. Without money, personality becomes mean; with money, personality becomes noble. This is the prejudice of modern society, which is wrong. Poor people may not be without shame and morality, but so-called rich and noble people may still have hoarding, manipulation, and price gouging activities. (It can be said to be a treacherous conspiracy.) Can it be said that they have morality and shame? I say this is meanness, the shame of the heart. They put on a mask of false purity to criticize truly noble people, which is what they consider to be noble and honorable. Wise people will not find it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not need to complain in poverty, we only need to be content, and seek true happiness in poverty; we do not need to envy other people's comfort, because people with abundant material enjoyment may not be truly happy; as long as our hearts are bright, and there is nothing we have done to wrong others, we can stand tall and be without shame, then we are good citizens. And people who become rich immorally, their spirit is mean, they do not deserve to be good citizens. (Reward for assistance funds)</p>
<h3>Watching "Welcoming Spring Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Zong Yue</p>
<p>Made by Man'ei</p>
<p>Director: Yasushi Sasaki</p>
<p>Starring: Li Xianglan</p>
<p>If you want to see Li Xianglan's fashion and listen to Li Xianglan's singing, this movie is sure to satisfy your appetite. Also, if you want to enhance some feelings with your "good friend," or if you have always loved to watch soft movies, this is exactly what you need.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you don't understand Japanese, it doesn't matter if you don't "buy" the instructions, it doesn't matter if you don't rent a translation device, because I watched it under these three "no's." When the film speaks Mandarin, you can understand it. When it speaks Japanese, there is a translation next to it, sentence by sentence, without any difficulty. Speaking of the film's content:</p>
<p>(1) Screenwriting: The screenwriter is very clever. Although it cannot escape the story of a love triangle, it is not old-fashioned. "Charming, flirtatious, and passionately interesting," it is truly able to combine both.</p>
<p>(2) Director: Only a few ice skating scenes are a bit messy, but the rest are very delicate.</p>
<p>(3) Actors: Li Xianglan's liveliness, beauty, ice skating, singing, Mandarin, and Japanese are all on full display here. Speaking of acting skills, I love the big guy who plays Murakami Takeo. His slow, unhurried attitude, his smiling and wonderfully evocative words, are truly amusing. I suspect that he was originally an optimist who didn't care about anything. In addition, many supporting roles played by Chinese people are very natural and appropriate, completely without the kind of things that make people feel disgusted in American movies.</p>
<p>(4) Sound: Ordinary, up to standard.</p>
<p>(5) Photography: Not as poetic as "Mother and Son Grass." But clear and beautiful enough to deserve a compliment.</p>
<p>(6) Short Film: The short film is Toho's song and dance film "Butterfly Beauty." The protagonist is Tsukio Yumeji from "New Snow." Overall, it is okay, but the meaning seems a bit cliché, and the music is a bit harsh.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (4)</h3>
<p>— Oshita Udaru</p>
<p>(5) Another World</p>
<p>People in the real world—the navy often calls the ordinary world on land the real world—seem to know that submarines are a very arduous world. And the fact is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>The captain bears the entire responsibility. He does not go to bed during the voyage, at most he naps in the chair inside the command tower. When he dozes off, as long as the ship body has a slight shake, or the object, the air has a sound, he immediately wakes up. His attention never rests. If any one of the crew members makes even the slightest mistake, it will cause irreparable serious consequences, so he dare not slack off for a moment. Even in the long-term, enduring and secret search for the enemy, after seeing the enemy and giving the order to prepare for artillery warfare—surface—all actions of the crew are required to be at the maximum speed possible for humans. When stopping artillery warfare—rapid dive—the deckhands also do not drill into the ship from the hatch. Only turn the hatch down. Then stuffing sticks and other iron objects are thrown at their heads like bullets. In addition, they are trapped in narrowness, heat, busyness, lack of water, lack of air, and lack of sunlight.</p>
<p>But the crew members must be treated with great care, and they must not be made unhappy. That is to say, you cannot get angry, once you get angry, you're done. The crew members must first have great self-esteem. They must have confidence and ambition, and then there will be the happiness of another world that is unknown in the real world.</p>
<p>The first kind of happiness is when the enemy is discovered. When the torpedoes they launch head towards the enemy ship, the entire crew prays sincerely and waits for the result. Then there is a deafening sound of hitting the target, followed by the sound of the enemy ship breaking apart in the sea. There is nothing else to compare to the happiness after hearing these sounds. Everything is forgotten. It is the highest peak of human joy.</p>
<p>The second kind of happiness is that the ship is completely integrated, completely understood, and mutually trusted, forming a family. This is not external packaging, not casually said, hypocrisy. A kind of intimate connection between hearts and hearts that is consistent with the real character. Living and dying together, so there cannot be a single person with an idea of distrust. This natural, not bragging life is as fresh and happy as heaven. It is right to respect the crew's hardship. But in a world where disguise and appearance are regarded as normal, at least spiritually, it is not refreshing.</p>
<p>(6) Nothing to Be Surprised About</p>
<p>A certain worldly writer—a writer with a strong sense of emotion—said to a certain naval officer:</p>
<p>"It's so great! Before the night battle in the Solomon Islands, each ship was training leisurely as usual. I was simply grateful when I heard that..."</p>
<p>"Ah! Is that so?"</p>
<p>The naval officer replied indifferently, not expressing agreement with his gratitude. Therefore, the writer felt very disappointed. Because the navy does not think that kind of training in that kind of situation is particularly great. It is regarded as a common thing, not worth surprising. After the fierce battle, even during the cleaning time, they swept the car without a second thought.</p>
<p>That is, in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, on the day after gaining such a great victory, they resolutely carried out the same training as usual.</p>
<h3>Departure (2)</h3>
<p>— Naval Reporting Team Member: Hiroshi Hamamoto</p>
<p>"You must know that Guadalcanal has a particularly complex terrain."</p>
<p>The bald man wiped the residual beer on his cigarette-stained yellow middle finger and drew a sketch of Guadalcanal on the table.</p>
<p>"Our troops reached this place at that time. One day, an intelligence officer from our country came here."</p>
<p>Although the bald man stretched out his finger, he didn't want to point at the map while savoring the beer.</p>
<p>"It was during that time that Ensign Matsukaze left his subordinates and was standing to urinate. As you know, he suddenly saw a very tall man standing in the woods less than ten meters away. That person pointed a pistol at him and asked for a cigarette. The enemy soldier, who seemed to be lacking supplies, told him to raise his hands. Ensign Matsukaze was greatly surprised, and of course, had to stop urinating and wait for what would happen next. But he didn't speak the broken English he usually spoke, and just thought quietly. If he drew his sword, the enemy would of course fire. Fighting a robber would already put him at a disadvantage. Moreover, there might be other enemies around. Thinking of this, he simply finished urinating and even started buttoning up his pants, remaining very calm."</p>
<p>Recently, this has become a well-known martial arts legend in this base. It turned out that this bald reporting team member had been there at the time, and he spread the story when he came back. His colleagues in the dormitory had heard him tell it many times, but everyone had never gotten tired of it, and this time they were listening to him with great interest.</p>
<p>"He calmly took out a cherry box from his pocket, and Ensign Matsukaze handed it to the enemy. The enemy didn't notice his malicious intent and boldly walked over. Ensign Matsukaze's left hand suddenly grabbed the enemy's pistol. Using all his strength to hold it, he swung his right hand and drew his sword. It all happened in the blink of an eye, and the enemy's bright red blood spurted out, and he fell to the ground dead."</p>
<p>"Were you watching the fun from the side?"</p>
<p>A short companion wearing particularly large glasses interjected half-jokingly, but the bald man ignored him and continued:</p>
<p>"The interesting part is the story after that. Not long after, Ensign Matsukaze felt that the place was not good, so he walked away. I forgot to mention giving the enemy a cigarette. If he was killed without giving him a cigarette, that would be a bit of a swindle. He felt very sorry, so he seriously took out a cigarette to give to the dead man to smoke. Everyone thought it was dangerous, so they all advised him not to go, but Ensign Matsukaze was very stubborn and didn't listen at all. So, everyone had no choice but to prepare their weapons and follow him."</p>
<p>The bald man finished speaking in one breath, and then drank the remaining beer in one gulp.</p>
<p>Four Gun Emplacements</p>
<p>After spending a long time completing the business at headquarters, Reserve Ensign Matsukaze ran over, sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Reserve Lieutenant Edo said, "I just heard about your Guadalcanal martial arts story," and now looked at the face of his old friend seriously.</p>
<p>"That story? It's all in the past."</p>
<p>Ensign Matsukaze answered casually and sat beside the bald man.</p>
<p>"Mr. Matsukaze, did you meet Lieutenant Taniyama last night?" This was said by the reporting team member whose face was half-covered by glasses.</p>
<p>"Did you go to the gun emplacements?" Ensign Matsukaze asked back.</p>
<p>"Because the moonlight was good, the enemy planes could be spotted immediately without any mistakes when they attacked, so I went to take pictures of the anti-aircraft guns fighting the enemy."</p>
<p>"What was the result? Did you take good pictures?" Ensign Matsukaze asked.</p>
<p>"No. When the guns fired, a cloud of dust rose up beside them, so it was impossible to take pictures. It can be said that it was a complete failure." The bespectacled man laughed and continued to tell the story of that time.</p>
<p>"But because it was a complete failure, Mr. Taniyama laughed at me."</p>
<p>"What exactly happened?"</p>
<p>"Enemy aircraft B-17 lowered its altitude and boldly strafed with machine guns. It's not easy to deal with machine gun strafing, so everyone was shouting 'Where's the air-raid shelter? Where's the air-raid shelter?' And there was someone shouting above them. There are no air-raid shelters in the gun emplacement area! If you're afraid of machine guns, hide in the ammunition depot! This was said in a terrible and loud voice. The one who made this sound was Lieutenant Taniyama. He told me to give you his regards."</p>
<p>"Taniyama commanded the cannons?" "I don't know what he usually does, but last night he was commanding the searchlights. This is really not an easy task. The enemy's machine guns were of course going to concentrate on shooting at this place, not to mention that there was our own anti-aircraft gun position right next to it. What's more, the naval forces also concentrated their fire on this place. The fragments of the anti-aircraft shells exploded in the sky and fell like raindrops. In this hail of bullets, Taniyama resolutely commanded without moving. Lieutenant Taniyama is very tall and has a large physique, he is very magnificent. This scene should be painted." As he said this, he turned to the oil painter from the art team.</p>
<p>Ensign Matsukaze said to Lieutenant Edo:</p>
<p>"Taniyama and I were in the same class in high school, university, and artillery school. I heard that his father was a local official for a long time, so he can be said to be from a prestigious family."</p>
<p>"University graduate officers are also quite active in this area!"</p>
<p>Lieutenant Edo simply had a different experience, and because he was also a reserve officer, he felt particularly interested.</p>
<p>At this time, the bald team member noticed Edo's collar badges and said, "Which school did you graduate from?"</p>
<p>Ensign Matsukaze interjected to answer:</p>
<p>"Edo graduated from a higher merchant marine school, so his service is different from ours. It seems he will be serving on a torpedo boat."</p>
<p>"Torpedo boat, that's really refreshing. Mr. Edo, I wish you success on your first mission." Reporting Team Member Nanjo smiled with a sigh and stroked his bald head. (Source: Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Suicide Case of a Female Teacher: All Sectors Express Discontent and Demand Legal Sanctions Against the Offending Parent</h3>
<p>(1) According to reports, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School on Pingliang Road was abused and beaten by a parent who came to the school because she had disciplined a student, leading to the teacher's death from anger. This is truly infuriating. At a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, teachers are among the most impoverished in all professions. However, teachers, with the spirit of enlightening the people, patiently and earnestly guide and teach children all day long, nurturing talents who will become the pillars of society and the foundation of the country in the future. The importance and magnitude of their responsibility is known to all. How could this parent be so unreasonable, disregarding the dignity of teachers, and instead insulting them, leading to a terrible disaster? The teacher's future is unimaginable. I ask, when children enter school, they most need the strict discipline of teachers. Even if they are given minor punishments, there is no reason to complain. It is even more questionable that the school authorities stood by and watched during this dispute. Alas! Where is the protection of education? The cheapness of human life is evident. I cannot help but cry aloud for this lonely and helpless woman. I believe this matter will be condemned by social justice and sanctioned by national law, and will surely be vindicated in this world, never to be left with injustice underground! (Ms. Wenmei)</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Su Yi, because he was beaten and insulted by a student's parent, died from poisoning with grievance, sacrificing himself for education. All of us are indignant upon hearing this. Educating children is the teacher's duty. Although it is a time of high prices, teachers' income cannot support the whole family, but we have never seen anyone neglecting education due to financial difficulties. Every teacher educates for the sake of education, cultivating the future masters of the country. Since Mr. Su was a teacher, it was his duty to educate children. If a student's textbook is not submitted on time, they should of course be punished. Since the student Liu Zhijun violated the rules, he should be sanctioned. If the teacher did not pursue the matter, it would be the teacher's fault. Why didn't the parent severely reprimand the student, but instead believed what he said and questioned and insulted the teacher? And the parent is neither a plant nor a cold-blooded animal, how could he not distinguish right from wrong and act arbitrarily? This is no less than an insult to our entire education community. All of us are unable to seek justice for Mr. Su due to our limited strength. We hereby appeal to people from all walks of life and the wise education authorities of the city to support all schools. Sincerely, the entire faculty of Si Gao Middle and Elementary School.</p>
<p>(3) Having read the news of the teacher who died from humiliation in your newspaper, I cannot help but feel indignant. It is within the teacher's duty to punish students. How can the student's parent interfere? Now, Liu's mother does not discipline her son, but arrogantly goes to the school to insult the teacher, bullying her because she is a lonely and weak woman, leading to a fatal incident. It is hateful and lamentable. After being humiliated, Mr. Su had resentment and anger in his chest, and his cry for help was hidden in his heart, leading to his death, which can be described as tragic. I ask the wise authorities to not only order the parent to bear all the funeral expenses required by Mr. Su, but also to impose severe punishment, so that Mr. Su, though holding resentment in the nine springs, can also rest in peace, and can also prohibit student parents from interfering in school affairs again. (Peijun)</p>
