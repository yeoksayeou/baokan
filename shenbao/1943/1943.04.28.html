<p>社評</p>
<h3>世界戰局重心之轉移</h3>
<p>突尼斯苦戰之結束，已是一個時間問題，世界戰略家和戰局觀察者的目光，開始轉移到地中海方面，「誰是地中海的主人」的戰事，無疑的將是一九四三年世界戰爭的第二幕。</p>
<p>地中海是聯繫歐亞非三洲的要衝，數千年來，諸民族以地中海爲舞台的鬥爭，其目的無非在由地中海的控制。以操縱歐亞非三洲的政治與經濟。英國很早就想以地中海爲自已的金谷園中的池塘，排斥其他民族的勢力，獨享其經濟上乃至政治上的優越權利。特別是從一六九二年拉奧格戰役以來，掌握了西地中海的霸權，進而企圖掌握全地中海，以確立其對歐洲大陸和歐亞非三洲關係的支配權。而地中海沿岸國家，如義，如法，如土，如西，也都希望獲得地中海的主權，以保障其軍事上經濟上的安全。這種戰略形勢，到今天便有更重要的意義。特別是從羅美爾將軍飛臨非洲戰塲及克里特島爲軸心軍佔領以後，從利比亞衝到埃及的軸心軍，如果攻陷開羅，扼住蘇彝士運河，同時東綫的軸心軍，由高加索南下，會師於西亞，則地中海將成爲德義的內海；而更重要的是，那時通過波斯灣，印度洋，使東亞和歐非的戰爭合成一體。由於種種偶發的事件，特別是法國達朗一派的叛變，美軍之非洲登陸，及英軍之西進，這種形勢已被阻住。然而，從整個戰局來看，軸心軍決不能因此疏懈其保衛地中海的決心的。因爲，只有傾全力以確保其對地中海的支配，纔能維持歐洲戰塲上軸心戰略優越地位，再度對非洲及西亞展開其攻勢。</p>
<p>目前地中海的形勢，表面上似乎對反軸心軍有利的，突尼斯的戰事一旦結束，則英美及法國叛軍可能控制南岸全綫，對義大利，法國南岸及希臘國土，形成一大威脅。但是，至今日爲止，軸心軍在地中海上，還保持其相當優越的地位。突出於地中海中的亞平寗半島，在地勢上，不失爲地中海作戰的勝利基礎，從這個半島及西西里和突尼斯的比塞大之間，軸心軍保持着不可動搖的聯絡綫，使英國的主要戰略據點馬爾太完全失去價値，而保障了突尼斯之戰的堅持性。再加南部法國海岸自軸心軍進駐以來，積極從事防衛設施，不僅使法國內部的叛亂醞釀被鎭壓下去，而且也成爲西班牙始終堅持其立場的有力保證。在東部地中海，主要的戰略根據地如杜德卡耐斯和克里特等，都在軸心軍手裏，使塞浦魯斯的反軸心軍不能活動，同時，也成爲土耳其堅決中立的根據。綜合來說，整個地中海的形勢。軸心軍還是站布優越的地位的。在英義企圖進一步展開戰局之時，首先就要爲這個既成事實而感到躊躇。所以，就是美國最輕言與樂觀的戰略家們，最近也不能不指出，假如突尼斯戰事結束了，反軸心軍至少還要以六個月的時間，從事於地中海的苦戰，然後始有向歐洲大陸展開「第二戰綫」的可能。</p>
<p>不問今後世界戰局的趨向如何，我們除了地中海的現實形勢之外，還必須認淸下列兩個戰塲，始終是具有決定的意義的。第一戰塲即是德蘇的東線，接着冬季而來的泥濘季節，快要完結了，在過去幾個月內，軸心軍始終致力於春夏攻勢準備，在戰爭中力避戰鬥力的消耗，在後方力謀新戰力的增加。哈科夫之戰是小試其端，今後大攻勢之展開，自在意料之中。同一期間，蘇聯是採攻勢的，因此，戰鬭力之消耗，及其後方新戰鬭力之整理，是否可和軸心軍相比，終是一個疑問。因此，我們可以斷言，東綫的未來戰鬭，其重要性決不亞於地中海或其他戰塲的。在東綫沒有必勝把握的前提之下，英美決沒有能力發動所謂「第二戰綫」這是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>第二個具有決定今後戰局的戰塲，是在太平洋上。我們必須鄭重指出，不管英美如何巧辯，最近一年多的期間，反軸心軍所以不能在歐洲開闢「第二戰綫」，與其謂爲英美蘇聯之間的矛盾，或其他種種原因，不如直截了當的說，是由於英美實力不足，而英美實力不足的主要原因，除了英國的武力差不多全部被集中於地中海之後，更重要的就是美國的戰鬭力的大半被拖住在太平洋上。現在英美的戰略家和報紙，一面雖然侈言「未來戰局」與「第二戰綫」，一面又不得不特別重視日本對西南太平洋乃至對美國本土的威脅，而「澳洲即將遭遇侵略」，日軍將征服全部「新幾內亞」的驚惶的呼喊，更可證明這一點，和反軸心軍對未來戰局喪失自信心的癥結所在。</p>
<p>總之，世界戰局重心之轉移，顯然使地中海重新成爲世界人士集注的戰塲，而東綫和太平洋戰塲，則始終對於世界戰爭具有決定的力量。我們東亞民族在這戰爭新局勢之中，應該特別提高勝利的自信心，而各自爲神聖的目標而奮鬭，決不容許苟且偸安，放棄責任。</p>

<h3>蘇聯政府宣布　對波蘭斷絕邦交　協約陣營首次暴露烈痕</h3>
<p>瑞七京成二十七日中央社電　莫斯科廣播電台昨晚宣稱：蘇聯政府已與倫敦薛柯斯基將軍之波蘭流亡政府斷絕外交關係，此　所謂「協約國」陣營內之首决公開決裂。喘典京城二十七日中央社電</p>
<p>據莫斯科廣播：蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫，二十六日會以通牒照會波蘭駐蘇大使羅瑪，　佈蘇聯政府與波蘭政府斷絕國交。羅瑪大使接到該通牒後，即由莫斯科起程赴庫璧希夫。又蘇聯政府照會波蘭之通牒內容爲（一）波蘭亡命政權對蘇聯之態度顯爲異常，且蔑視同盟國間之一切規的及正常之手續，（二）國際間盛傳蘇聯政府在斯摩倫斯克殘殺波蘭將士等敵對官傳之時，波蘭亡命政權亦乘此機會，採取敵對宣傳，復以機關報企圖擴大該事件：（三）波蘭亡命政權不僅要求蘇聯政　　明該事件，更進而要求日內瓦萬國紅十字會調查該事件眞相：蘇聯政府鑒於以上各事，遂對波蘭亡命政權宣吿斷絕國交云。</p>
<h3>蘇波邦交破裂經過</h3>
<p>東京廿七日中央社電　前當一九三九年九月德軍與波蘭開始作戰時，蘇軍會乘機侵入波蘭，奪取波蘭東部大半土地，並將其編入本國版圖。關於此事，亡命倫敦之波蘭政府會向蘇政府提出嚴重抗議，但蘇政府則謂該地原係蘇領，後由波蘭依據凡爾賽條約而奪去，對波蘭亡命政府之抗議完全置之不埋。自此以後，蘇波兩國關係即呈絕交狀態。直至一九四一年六月廿一日德蘇開戰，蘇聯政府企圖與波蘭亡命政府恢復外交關係，乃由波總理薛柯斯基至莫斯科進行折衝，結果兩國締結盟的。蘇聯政府在該條　中表示決尊重波蘭之主權，並約定釋放波軍俘虜爲收復失地，兩軍協力與德軍作戰等。迨至蘇軍首决冬季反攻開始後，蘇聯即動員一切宣傅機關，明白表示蘇聯於戰後決將舊波蘭土編入本國版圖之意。乃外交人民委員部决長哥爾納邱克意在眞理報上公然否認波蘭國之存在，波蘭亡命政府即深爲不安，乃令駐蘇大使羅瑪向蘇聯政府提出嚴重抗議。同時波總理薛柯斯基親自出馬，分向英美兩國政府懇求支持戰後確保舊波蘭之疆界，但英美兩政府爲獻媚蘇聯乃以時期尙早未予過問。波政府對英美兩國此種曖昧態度，大感失望。又再度責問蘇方失的，但蘇聯政府竟向波總理薛柯斯基致送最後通牒，於是蘇波兩國關係至此遭遇破局，而德軍當局復於四月廿二日公佈蘇秘密警察曾在斯摩倫斯克附近加丁森林中殘殺波軍將校萬餘人之事件。波政府聞訊之餘，深爲憤激，要求蘇聯說明詳情，但蘇政府僅稱此係德國宣傳部長戈培爾所揑造而置之不理，結果波蘭政府託萬國紅會調查眞相，蘇政府認爲反軸心陣營中之「盟邦」已受軸心官傳之鼓勵，採取敵對行爲，遂惱羞成怒與波蘭絕交。觀於波蘭亡命政府於十六日在倫敦所發表之聲明，即可知蘇波兩國實已無法同舟共濟。</p>
<h3>波蘭政府緊急會義</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據倫敦來電：波蘭亡命政府與蘇聯斷絕外交關係後，爲決定該政府今後態度起見，特於今日正午十一時召開緊急閣議，但散會後並未發表仟何正式聲明。又波蘭現尙有數師團之兵力配備於伊朗國內，故該軍與蘇軍之關係，頗爲一般所重視。然據　觀測，波蘭電因配備於英軍駐軍地區，故蘇波絕交後處理波蘭軍之問題，或不致趨於嚴重。</p>
<h3>華府聞訉表示惋惜</h3>
<p>里斯木二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓消息：美國務院發言人昨日對蘇聯與波蘭流亡政府外交關係破裂一事，表示惋惜。渠稱，「美國政府對於該兩國政府發生齟齬之問題，並不表示意見，惟獲悉是項發展之後，不勝惋惜」。</p>
<p>里期本二十七日中央社電　英外交部當局頃對蘇聯政府宜佈與波蘭斷絕國交事發表意見，略謂，國際間對該事件表示滿足者，恐僅軸心國而巳，且此事件允可謂戈培爾之宣傳勝利。至於反軸心各國並非對蘇聯或波蘭有何同一關係，然僅在希望維持反軸心國間之團結云。</p>
<h3>萬人塚案辦認工作</h3>
<p>柏林廿七日中央社電　海通社消息，咯坦森科中四月廿三日掘獲波軍官屍首五百具，該屍首富時被埋於森林隱蔽之地。刻下波紅十字會已加入調查委員會，故辨認工作較爲順利，巳經辨認之屍首名單巳由德方公佈，犧牲者之職位自中尉至上校不等，均屬於陸空軍者。</p>
<p>西班牙京城廿七日中央社電　西班牙著名醫學家瑪德里大學法醫學敎授畢加博士，巳啟程赴斯摩倫斯克與外國醫學專家多人，檢騐萬人塚案中之波蘭軍官屍體。</p>
<h3>晉南包圍戰將完成　戰事已入最後階段</h3>
<p>東京廿七日中央社電據晋南太行山前綫廿七日來電，日軍對渝方第廿四集團軍展開之殲滅戰，已入最後階段。臨淇盆地及陵川，田家井巴東姚集附近之渝軍，現已全陷於混亂狀態，於日軍包圍中，不久即可殲滅。冀察戰區司令官蔣鼎文，爲保全其本身實力，幷未派遣援軍，故投降日軍之各將校，均表憤慨，因此次戰事失敗，重慶對蔣鼎文此種措置，頗爲不滿。前年夏季衛立煌因中原會戰失敗，受重慶非難，而致下野，乃命天水行營主任蔣鼎文繼衛立煌之後任，此次第廿四集團軍之敗潰，及新編第五軍長孫殿英之投降，料蔣鼎文亦必步衛立煌之後，陷於悲運。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　據晋省前綫二十七日電，晋豫省境日軍，於二十七日下午三時發表戰報稱：日軍與附近部隊會合，於二十三日在臨洪附近，協力圍攻渝軍第二十四集團軍主力，至二十四日已予以重創，日軍並將殘敗渝軍追至景冀省境山地，將其擊潰，並覆滅渝軍根據地，日軍此次作戰頗獲成果。迄二十六日晚止，調查結果，共擊斃渝軍約三千人，俘虜七千人，並奪獲大批軍火，又俘虜戰死之渝軍中中將階級者，計有軍長等十餘人，於此足證該方面渝軍，業巳完全瀕潰於滅。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　據晋省前綫電　日軍後藤部隊今村中尉會參加攻佔渝新編第五軍據點臨淇之役，據談此次攻佔臨洪與孫殿英投降情形，大意謂：渝新編第五軍司令設於臨淇，其師司令部則設於臨洪南方之西張村，由臨洪至西張村之道路，頗爲整潔。日軍包圍臨洪作戰，係自二十二日開始，俾與南進部隊互相呼應，當時大隊日機亦會參加作戰，猛炸渝軍陣地，渝軍雖曾負隅頑抗，但遭日軍猛攻後，終吿崩潰，而向陸州方面遁走，其時日軍南進部隊巳切斷其退路，渝軍二萬遂被日軍包圍，成爲甕中之鼇。二十三日晨起日軍即同時展開殲滅戰，在臨洪西南方李家寨與渝軍主力部隊經二小時激戰後，將實行追擊戰時，見渝軍陣中有孫殿英之參謀長等軍使之人，手持白旗前來申請投誠，至二十三日下午二時五十五分，孫殿英遂向日軍投誠。</p>
<p>徐州二十七日中央社　在隴海路東段沿綫作戰之日軍，二十五日晚在碭山東南方攻擊北侵之渝系第九十二軍李仙洲部的三千人，與由某方面出動之日軍相協力，展開猛烈之殲滅戰，至二十六日夜仍繼續猛攻，收獲極大戰果。日軍各精銳部隊，於是役已使李仙洲所部第九十二軍移駐魯省之企圖，完全受挫。茲誌日軍自二十五日晚迄二十七日晨所獲之綜合戰果如决：渝軍遺屍一三〇〇具，俘虜二三〇人，鹵獲品有迫擊砲二，迫擊砲彈藥三〇，重機槍三，輕機槍十一，擲彈筒十一，步槍二四七，彈藥五〇，手槍二七。</p>
<h3>華北治安會議　剿滅渝共方策</h3>
<p>北京二十七日中央社電　華北治安軍當局，爲謀確立中國參戰後北方各省市之治安起見，特召集各地集團軍司令，於二十五日二十六日兩日，在此間治安總署，舉行中國參戰後首次治安會議，討論剿滅渝共軍之具體方策。</p>
<h3>國府嚴禁　用祝壽名義獻金</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　國民政府命令：（三十二年四月二十七日）各地國　獻余，出於愛國熱忱，政府自應嘉納，惟近來有用祝壽名義者，此係西安事變前之醜態，深可傷心，著嚴切制止，此令。主席在兆銘。</p>
<h3>周副院長　在平談話</h3>
<p>南京廿七日中央社電　本月十九日，周副院長在平談話，關係未來國府對地方政治調整之方針，日前電訊傳達頗多出入，茲覓得原稿，披露於下：『本人前决北上視察，係民國二十九年夏季，正値國民政府還都，中國歷史上劃一新時代之時期。此次重來，正値中國對英美宣戰，中國歷史上，更爲偉大之時期，故衷心至爲愉快，自鴉片戰爭以後，中國被英美剝削與壓迫，已百餘年，此次對宿敵英美宣戰，報百年之仇，雪百年之恨，並洗百年之恥，實乃中國最揚眉吐氣之一日。同時承友邦日本，自動取消治外法權，交還租界，使國父所囑取消不平等條約，以求中國自由平等之任務，得以完成，吾人於感謝之餘，倍覺前途之光明無限。此來目睹靑天白日旗飛揮於英美在華之大本營東交民巷使館區域，允令人歡欣鼓舞之情，不禁毅然而起。惟英美殘餘勢力，仍未消滅，最後勝利，尙未完成。今後仍須吾人之努力與奮鬥。本人以爲欲完成吾人所負之神聖使命，對外必須團結，對內必須統一，東亞軸心各國之團結，必須心如鐵石，固如金湯，各舉所有人力物力，以供獻於戰爭，然後英美之屈服可待，戰爭勝利可期。至國內不論東西南北，應將所有力量統一於中央，蓋五量集中則强，分散則弱，吾人如以分散之力量，與日本協力，其力必弱，而收效亦小，如以集中之力量，與日本協力，則其力必大，而收效亦宏。故爲有效的與友邦日本協力計，爲對大東亞戰爭作强有力之貢獻計，中國必將支離渙散之形勢，逐漸調整而形成名符其實之統一局面，始能達此目的。中日兩國賢明之士，高瞻遠矚，諒必同具此感。華北食糧問題，汪主席未嘗一日或忘，中央未嘗一日或忽，蓋華北爲中央之華北，而中央亦爲華北之中央，國民政府轄治下之人民，無論何地，均應甘苦與共，肥瘠與俱，過去徒以力不從心，對於華北人民之福利，未能多所設施，良深歉仄。今後關於物資之交流，交易基金之融通，以及其他各問題，苟中央力所能逮，必盡最大努力，爲華北民生力謀有所救濟。本人未來華北，已經三年，此行擬與華北當局，及在華北之友邦日本軍政各領袖，關於安定中國民生，增强中國作戰力量等問題，交換意見，使中國於大東亞戰爭中所分擔之責任，得以完成，使中國民生，得日趨安定。此次訪滿，承滿洲朝野上下之熱烈歡迎，至爲感謝，視察各地，目睹其各項產業之突飛猛進，一面對其當局之苦心經營，深表敬意，同時更深覺我國發展產業之急　　不待緩也。</p>

<h3>浙贛鐵道通車試乘記</h3>
<p>新生的浙贛鐵路，終於在萬人渴望中通車了。去年五月中旬，展開了打通浙贛的作戰，確保了浙東地區，各種建設，在此一年內，有了不少光輝的成就。</p>
<p>自金華到錢塘江南岸問的一百七十五公里的新生浙贛鐵道巳吿完成，記者特地趕往，試乘其處女列車。以下是試乘記：</p>
<p>……上午六點鐘，天氣還未完全發白的時候，金華站上停着一輛大東亞號列車，中日國旗招展，車輪響處，列車向前開動，羣衆歡呼的聲浪，震耳欲聾，車行後眺望金華城外，彈痕槍印累累，戰跡歷歷在目。在日軍嚴密警備下，治安完全恢復，這裏正是農作繁忙期間，家家戶的烟囱內，都是烟絲繚繞。牽着水牛在耕田的農夫，正在勤儉耕作，經幾决大雨淋過後的田地，等於天然耕過了一樣。赤黑的土，綠色的麥，白色的花，這是預兆豐年的象微，看不盡農村風光，說不盡美麗景象。</p>
<p>……輸轉烟飛，速度甚急，左手的小山，車內有一位軍官指着它說道：</p>
<p>「那面附近，是激戰最烈的地方　。我們一面看，車子一邊走，田野間的農夫，看見火車開來，高舉兩手，歡呼萬歲，車裏的人，都揮手示意，熱烈的歡迎。</p>
<p>……沿途各小站上，都懸旗歡迎，上車的旅客，非常擁擠，車站上賣點心，賣鷄蛋，賣西瓜子的叫喊聲音嘈雜，不多時，車抵義烏，這裏從前屬於會稽郡，自唐朝武德七年起，始稱義烏，明淸時代，改屬金華府，現在置有縣政府，出產的物品，計有螢石，煤斤，牛，猪，羊等，而且是金華火腿的主要原產地之一，義烏車站，大半已經落成，候車幸的側面，堆着許多螢石，風光極其美麗。從義烏到蘇溪的一段途中，景色宜人，可以用山明水秀四個字來形容，古柏靑松，山川並列，使我們趁在大東亞號列車上的人看了：嘆爲大自然之絕景，車行不久，就到了蘇溪，這裏附近，山川多險，路綫迂　曲折，建設工程最難</p>
<p>……遠遠地巳經可以看見相近諸曁的名勝之區桃花嶺，行不多幾時，巳經到了諸曁，從杭州開來的許多列車，先巳停在這裏，等待大東亞號的到來，我們趁的火車停了下來，窗口相　，兩邊的旅客，互相親切招呼，不多時大東亞號再向前開，兩車的旅客，各呼萬歲吿別，按諸曁古稱曁國，後來因爲有諸山及曁浦，所以改　爲諸曁，著名土產有螢石，茶，家畜，陶磁，柏油，桐油等類，一出諸暨，就可看到有名的尖山，平坦的田地和斷斷續續的丘陵相啣接，又看見在小站上有一塊寫着「東山」兩字的木牌，再過去看見小河上架有一頂木橋，上寫着大東亞橋，這些字跡，都是警備沿綫的日軍勇士所寫，過尖山不遠就是湄池，一會兒巳經到達，湄池是第一期工程的終點站，建築大多工竣，候東室和辦公室，非常整齊。</p>
<p>……時過正午，開到了蕭山，蕭山在春秋時代稱爲越國的西陵，漢代更名爲余暨縣，在宋，元，明各朝，都是屬於紹興府，從蕭山到紹興，有長途汽車來充交通工具，聽說不久還要擴展公路直達寗波，必能促進浙東地區的物資交流，蕭山出產也很多，計有棉，紙，米，生絲，柏油，桐油，家畜等類。下午三時半，到達了錢塘江南岸的江邊，於十個鐘頭的浙東縱斷處女通車已吿完畢，希望這倏鐵路早日完成爲大東亞共榮圈的一大幹綫，大東亞號列車的黑烟，縱橫南北，這是我們所熱望的。記者就在江邊火車站下車，結束了此行的任務，得到了目睹偉大建設的收獲。（小野特派員金華電—鵬：譯自三十二年四月二十七日大陣新報）</p>

<h3>協約軍分三路進攻　突境展開坦克大戰　軸心軍縮短陣綫於防禦更有利　彭杜法斯前綫德軍反攻獲大捷</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　昨晚德國新聞社消息：德方阿爾寗中將在數地點縮短其陣綫，以期對於英美軍向突尼斯與比塞大推進之企圖，作更有效之遏阻。德軍方人士對突尼西亞戰事之未來發展均抱自信，美方安德森將軍雖以强大坦克車隊加入作戰，但因軸心軍抵抗之堅强，毫無建樹。軸心軍星期日共擊毀英美坦克車七十三輛，同時德義空軍亦在集擊中轟毀英美祖克車二十一輛。自一九四二年十月一日以來，反軸心軍在北非戰塲損毀之坦克車共達三·一一七輛。</p>
<p>里斯本廿七日中央社電　突尼西亞戰綫軸心軍數量雖寡，但仍繼續勇猛抵抗，並得礦保主要陣地。西部戰綫梅傑茲埃爾巴勃及彭杜法斯兩地戰鬥之激烈，實自突尼西亞戰綫開戰以來所未有。據阿爾及爾來電：均謂軸心軍之抵抗力已見增大。梅傑茲埃爾巴勃及彭杜法斯兩地之英第一軍主力，恃兵力衆大，會向軸心軍陣地反復進攻，廿五夜軸心軍在梅傑茲埃爾巴勃東南古伯拉，會實行戰略之撤退，轉守有力之新陣地。又布阿拉達及彭杜法斯方面軸心軍，亦因英第一軍與法叛軍之聯合進攻，已放棄其突出陣地，集中兵力於該方面主要陣地，以阻止反軸心軍之前進。</p>
<p>柏林廿七日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱：突尼西亞戰綫現正進行空前之大劇戰，反軸心軍以其人力及物力之優越，不顧損失之重大，源源增派軍隊作戰，具方法與蘇聯如出一轍。英軍之拼死冀圖突破，已遭軸心軍之奮勇抵抗，戰鬥現在較短之戰綫進行中。英第一軍於星期六及星期日在突境戰綫中段梅傑茲埃爾巴勃附近，分三路發動猛烈攻勢。第一路係向傑貝爾安格方面推進，第二路（中鋒）向泰波拉方面推進，第三路即南路，向彭杜法斯推進。其中路及北翼推進之軍隊巳被遏阻，惟南蠶續有進展，巳被其佔領古　村特。安特森將軍似巳決心將其所有一切準備，尤其是坦克車，使用於南部作戰，以冀以任何代價奪取彭杜法斯或兼佔領柴格霍恩。敵軍此舉足以威脅軸心軍南翼之後衛，故德軍巳出動坦克車隊作大規模之反攻。第一陣進攻巳被擊退至彭杜法斯迤西及西北一帶，至星期一晨，該處仍有激烈之坦克車戰。英軍亦續以壓力加諸泰波拉方面，企圖突破軸心軍陣地向柴格霍安衝進，但迄未獲逞。英第一軍在沿海區塞拉特角迤南之左翼，有美軍助戰，雖略有進展，但在戰略上不足重視，法叛軍與一部份美軍則在安特森之右翼作戰，但無何成就。英軍在山區局部進攻，企　深入山地，亦未獲逞。南突尼西亞戰况並無軍大變化，安特森在沿海奪取費希小港未逞。衆料英第八軍將在近期內又將恢復其攻勢。</p>
<h3>羅斯托夫迤西　蘇軍進攻未得逞</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿七日中央社電　蘇軍司令部以德軍夏季攻勢巳迫近，極爲焦慮，乃於二十六日在羅斯托夫西方之米沃斯戰錢，突開始大規模之攻勢，於猛烈砲擊後，又以戰車隊爲先鋒，企圖由正面突破德軍陣地，然經德軍以野砲及迪擊砲集中砲火迎擊，似已不支敗退。又拉多加湖南方及列寗格勒方面蘇軍曾出以小規模攻勢，然亦微德軍守備隊擊退。同時德空軍之攻勢益趨熾烈，二十五日一日間在南部戰綫擊落蘇機八架，於其他戰綫擊落十六架，並於諾伏洛西斯克及庫彭兩地區予蘇軍以極大損害。</p>
<h3>『對華政策躍進之今後』　日田尻公使在日報撰文</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　此間東京新聞今日載日本駐華公使田尻愛義氏所撰「對華政策躍進之今後」一文，說明新中國以大東亞共榮圈之理念，在政治經濟及文化上之活潑動向，並力言應澈底排除英美國家觀及英美思想，同時，指出以大東亞共榮圈之立塲，確立新思想，乃爲當務之急，議論扼要，頗堪重視。茲誌大意如次：「日本對華政策之躍進，係表現於政治經濟文化等三方面，然事實上，此項對華政策，決非爲一種新構想，抑且會經充分之研究與討論，而巳爲大衆所共知者。故與其謂爲一種新政策，勿寗謂日本之對華政策，已進至實踐期，或對華政策之實踐躍淮等爲佳。至於阻止日本實踐對華政策者，即爲英美勢力，故日本惟有完全粉碎英美勢力後，始能實行對華政策。又從中國之立塲而言，中國亦惟有將辛亥革命以來最大之障碍英美除去後，始能完成革命。同時此障碍物之除去，以及中國革命之完成期等兩相合符後，日方亦方能開始實踐，另一方面，中國亦方能報日本好意之政策，並能以大東亞共榮圈之理想建設新中國。觀上所述，所謂新政策者，實即爲今日强力推進中之中日關係，抑中國之參戰，因與日本實踐對華政策之時期相同，故此根本之意義，往往易爲中日兩國所誤解，此實爲中日兩國人士因應重新認識之重大問題。至於日本在政治方面所實踐之政策，即交還租界及使館區域，將英美等國敵產移交中國管理等，又類此問題及撤廢治外法權等，亦即將逐漸實施。以上種種，均予國民政府及全中國國民以極大好感，並使中國再燃起辛亥革命時之精神與氣魄，此種事實，當爲吾人所不能否認者。至於經濟問題，因並不似政治之簡單，且經濟問題爲一種具有不易移動之性質，又因經濟問題須有相當之設備，故極不易趨於表面化，然日本之眞意，與中國之熱意，巳產生一種結果，即爲新中國建設經濟及復興經濟之中心。於三月初在上海設立之全國商業統制總會，與此同時，又緩和限制物資移動，俾上海出入地間交流史趨圓滑，又以往日本爲維持軍持價格血展開之種種工作，今後則亦由中國方面自行配給物資，以期促進物資之收買。因此收買配給與仟上海方面相當程度之加工製造等，三者乃具有關聯，乃始能使華中之經濟交流，再開始活動。故此點若能成功，則對維持中儲券之價格，實有極大貢獻。同時統制總會之目標亦向諸方面進行，另一方面可見統制總會之成立，在政治上亦具重大會義，即上海經濟界人士爲　　復興經濟及中日之協力上，會一致努力。且統制總會中之理事及監事等人，均爲滬上經濟界一流人物，該會不僅得國府之指導更得日本之從旁協力，故此新組織，實頗爲一般人軍視。同時，華中之經濟復興，以及國府之强化，亦已得極大力量，或有人以爲此項見解，似稍樂觀，但上海及上海背後之華中經濟，實可謂已開始重建而强力推進。今後則尙有待於中國經濟界人士之努力，國府指導之得宜，及日本援助之得力，始能不斷推進，益加努力。當此努力獲得效果之時，以反努力不斷迅速獲效時，亦即爲上海經濟地位在全中國確立之時。同時不僅能使華中與華北之經濟問題，能得根本解決，且對非和平區之影響，亦極重大，故目下對此即抱樂觀，雖未免過早，然經濟建設之已開始出發，確爲事實。再就文化方面言，其最應注意者厥爲上海之出版事業，亦巳在恢復之中，又因上海之出版事業，佔全中國百分之九十，故具有相當勢力，其於中日事變後之萎摩不振情勢，今亦業巳漸告消失，此實爲新興聯合出版事業之開始。其目標在得中國文化之向上，並與日本溝通文化，而中國出版事業，在良好之意義上復興者，實以上海爲中心而展開之文化活動，思想運動，爲其前提。上海旣已如上述情形，而興起事亦可謂爲中國之興起及國民政府勢力強化之表現，亦爲中日問題解瘊之所在，其前途實頗樂觀。然於此尙有一須加愼　考慮之問題，即當日本對華新政策改變將來中日關係之時，吾人應將英美勢力，再以考慮，良以今日英美之軍事政治及經濟勢力雖已被驅出中國及大東亞，但在思想上，果能排除英美錯誤之觀念乎；日本人與中國人於考慮中日關係時，每感於英美之國家觀及英美式之國際觀念，或將英美之國家觀念，不加批評，予以接受，其對於中日關係，豈非缺乏充分之檢討乎？余認爲並非爲一容易獲得結論之簡單問題，而爲日本朝野或中國朝野應認眞研究其共同結論之問題。故余於此願指出思想之闡明及新思想之獲得結論，乃爲異常必要而急切者。</p>
<h3>對美芬關係　赫爾無明確表示　美駐芬代辦仍留任所</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓訊：笑國國務卿赫爾昨日宣稱，華盛頓對芬蘭之態度，一如前决之聲明。至於美國企圖佈置芬蘭與協約國問之和平，亦無若何可說。赫爾氏此項聲明，係在招待報界席上答覆關於駐芬使館人員一部份撇離後之局勢之詢問而發</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　美駐芬代辦麥克林托克現仍在任所，惟其夫人則已於昨日來此，與上週初離芬之大部份館員同時返國。麥氏會於星期日晚，在電話中與聯合社駐瑞京訪員談話，謂渠仍留任所，但對於美芬關係之未來發展，不願作任何批評。按美國駐芬公使姜恩費爾特，數月前返國後迄未返任。</p>
<h3>格魯向國人　再度發出警吿</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　美國前任駐日大使格魯，昨在希尼克太台演說，對於太平洋戰局之嚴重，再作警吿，略謂如容日人保留其在太平洋所獲得之資源並加以開發，則征服美洲本土之企圖，不過爲時間問題而已。吾人之國家城市及家室，均處於日本潛在軍事力量可怖威脅之下。此種力量可使日本爲全世界潛勢力最强之國家云。</p>
<h3>華萊士　游歷南美返國</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據此間接獲消息稱，美副總統華萊士在南美遊歷五星期後，巳於昨日返抵華盛頓。渠將於何時向羅斯福總統報告此行之結果，現尙未悉。華萊士承認在未來數月中，美國之航務狀况或將更趨惡劣，並謂渠所訪問各國之商業勞工及農業領袖，皆極盼望能將更多彼等所缺乏之物品運往。</p>
<h3>地中海　捕獲鯨魚</h3>
<p>瑪德里二十七日中央社電　西班牙漁人在巴爾瑪突瑪羅卡地區，捕獲鯨魚一尾，計重二千六百公斤，其肝重三百公斤。鯨魚在地中海中被捕，實爲罕見，現將此魚公開陳列。</p>
<h3>蘇聯戰力的檢討　軍需生產面臨嚴重關頭　人的資源已達飽和狀態</h3>
<p>（瑞典京城斯德哥爾摩嬉野特派員十七日發）以德義兩巨頭會談爲中心的德匈，德法，德羅首腦會談等，軸心國在歐洲的外交攻勢，爲所謂歐洲總力戰新體制之實踐化的第一步，引起了很大的注意。這總力戰新體制雖然包含着在攻守二方面的許多廣汎的軍事，政洽，經濟問題，然其總的歸趨，依然如希特勒所說「決定歐洲運命」的擊滅蘇聯的新計劃。那末不這一擊滅蘇聯的大攻勢，究將在幾時開始呢？外人不得而知，在希特勒自然胸有成竹。至於蘇聯方面，在今冬的大反攻中，業巳消耗了大半的軍事力」，將怎樣予以迎擊呢，怎樣才能完成「防衛祖國之戰」呢？物心兩方面戰力的眞相如何？其戰略如何？關於這些，僑居莫斯科的外國人殆無從窺知，因而傅說紛紜。茲根據當地所獲的諸情報，試加以詳細的檢討如下：</p>
<p>戰局的主導性</p>
<p>我們先來預測在德蘇的最後決戰上的主導性，即那方面先動手。現在有二個完全相反的見解：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯不顧冬季反攻的重大損失，乘德軍尙未整備就緒之前，盡其最後的力量開始攻勢，確保有利態勢，使遲遲迄今的英美展開第二戰綫，得以從速實現。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯軍不待德軍開始未來的決定的攻擊，即巳瀕於完全崩潰的危險。蘇聯軍的實體，最近巳極度疲敝，在前綫的師團，訓練不足之外，再加上了兵員的不足，甚至有許多師團的兵員，每師團僅一千五百人。</p>
<p>以上二種相反的論調，殊難判斷其何者爲正確，至少這二種論調都是各趨極端的。</p>
<p>紅軍的現有兵力</p>
<p>這二種論調的結局，同歸結到紅軍現有兵力的眞相問題。現在來看關於這問題之史具體的見解，三月十一日的普勞達報社論說：</p>
<p>「蘇聯軍對意料中德軍的攻擊，母須有何應念的準備，不要忘記，蘇聯現在已經佈置了充分的兵力，預備迎頭痛擊。」</p>
<p>普勞達報的這社論，並沒有涉及一切具體的數字。茲介紹消息靈通方面從比較的普遍的立塲，具體觀察紅軍兵力的見解如次：</p>
<p>「紅軍在東部戰綫保有配備較優的兵士的六百萬，在西伯利亞則有五十萬以上。此外，紅軍並謀有對德開戰前的兵力（據說有一百七十五師團）的三分之一。這一支兵力，史太林爲防備戰局的將來，所以即在一九四一年的莫期科之戰，一九四二年的史太林格勒之戰，亦捨不得使用。由此看來，在兵力方面，與去春殆無多大差別。可是蘇聯潛存着的深刻的弱點，亦不容忽視。在去春，蘇聯有三分之一的剩餘兵力，但現在已完全沒有剩餘了。現在如要擴大微兵範圍，則將削弱軍需生產及農業勞働力的最低限度，所以是不可能的。蘇聯之人的資源，即使如何龐大，也已經達到了飽和點，今夏若再受到重大損害，勢將不能恢復。况且現在的兵員，與去春比較，在質的方面，有可驚的低落，這是鐵一般的事實。紅軍自開戰以來，不絕地把戰鬥地帶的老少男女的非戰鬥員，直接使用於軍務？其軍隊內的比率，大略看來，今夏比一九四一年增加了百分之二十五以上。紅軍全兵力的十分之一，須依賴這些「非戰鬥員」的「戰鬥力」。其素質的低下，正在加速進行，普勞達報所說那樣的强力性，終不可恃」。</p>
<p>粗陋的美國製品</p>
<p>最近出版的倫敦週刋經濟學者（Eeomomist）稱：</p>
<p>「蘇聯的工業生產力，在一丸四一年末，比戰前减退四〇％以上。因工廠設備之有計劃的向伏爾伽，烏拉爾地方和西伯利亞方面遷移集中，故在去年末，比一九三九年巳恢復了八〇％以上」。</p>
<p>這自然帶點誇張性，又據蘇聯政府的正式發表：</p>
<p>「一九四二年第四季的飛機及軍需品生產，突破戰前紀錄」。</p>
<p>蘇聯增產中樞的烏拉爾，伏爾伽方面的生產力，是否業已全部利用，是一很大的疑問。烏克蘭方面之豐饒的資源如鐵，煤等的喪失，以及所積貯的原料之减少，即使烏拉爾，西伯利亞拚命的增產，至少在現階段，終究尙不能抵補。茲試閱烏拉爾及西部西伯利亞的增產狀况，一九四二年烏拉爾的鐵鑛產額，相當於一九三八年的二倍，爲一千四百萬噸。鋼鐵生產額增加四〇％庫斯納茲，加拉剛達的煤產額，一九四二年約有七千萬噸。（德國魯爾地方的煤產額年達二億萬噸。）這數字表示蘇聯的增產額確有顯著的上昇，這自然是因爲喪失了西部的資源後才大舉開發的，而且具體的說來，蘇聯自開戰以來，即以此地爲生產兵器和彈藥的重點。例如一九四二年烏拉爾地方的兵器生產，據發表達戰前的三倍。而鐵相其他原料的增產，到底不能追及這兵器之飛躍的增產。由於質的低下，或有的計對不能實現，以至於發生了深刻的生產機構內部的不均衡。</p>
<p>這緩和這困窘的狀態，英，美，尤以美國自戰爭勃發迄今，用飛機五千架，大砲一萬尊，及其他大量兵器，補給蘇聯。可是，這此美國製造的兵器，比蘇聯自裂的還要粗陋，耐寒性更其惡劣，實際上蘇聯軍直至今日尙未曾加以使用。徒然產生了浪費國內運輸能力的反對現象。</p>
<p>關於蘇聯的工業力，根據這種種片段的報道判斷起來，蘇聯在軍需生產上遭遇了重大的難關。消耗與生產的跛行狀態，在蘇聯的軍事上構成了一個大漏洞。</p>
<p>食糧問題</p>
<p>蘇聯喪失了農業寶庫烏克蘭之後，農業也遇到重大的危機。莫斯科政府爲避免發生饑饉狀態起見，努力擴充東部俄羅期的農地，在一九四二年中，新開拓了五百萬英畝，可是在此期間即北高加索已喪失了農地三千萬英畝。此次冬季攻勢中，蘇聯收復了頓河盆地及庫彭地方的一部，但一九四三年的收獲，仍不能如豐年一樣，因爲這地方的作物，以冬作的小麥爲主，不能立即改變爲春麥，英國的經濟學者週刋也指出食糧問題是目前蘇聯的重大弱點。美國自一九四一年三月至現在止，在此二年內，把三百萬噸食糧交付於蘇聯，然蘇聯仍以爲杯水車薪，無濟於事。戰時的食糧不足，是世界共通的現象，蘇聯怎樣打開目前的窘狀，爲一大問題。</p>
<p>德蘇的戰略</p>
<p>蘇聯的戰時態勢，旣有這許多矛盾與脆弱性，那來在預期的大決戰中，將採用何種戰略呢？對此，巳經也有許多觀測，中立國軍事消息靈通方面的見解，蘇聯此次仍將在德國攻勢的主動下，置其防衛的主力於高加棄，在該地將有堅決的抵抗，同時，以南部戰綫爲中心，積極展開局地的攻勢，或擴大其攻勢至中央戰綫，企圖分散德軍的攻勢兵力，以拖延戰事至冬季，而獲得有利態勢，可是德國是否冉蹈一九四一年，四二年的覆轍，允許紅軍蹈襲故智呢？希特勒此次如其開始大攻努，當然早巳見到紅軍的這冬將軍戰法，所以問題的結局，紅軍對數倍於以前的德軍大攻勢，其野戰主力的被毀滅，將達如何地步？假使蘇聯的軍事力果眞如上所述，那末蘇聯的全面危機是必至之勢，唯一的方法，祗有英美展開歐洲第二戰綫，才能挽救蘇聯這最後的危機，希特勒總統的未來對蘇大進攻，當然以「歐洲要塞」的完成以防止第二戰經的展開爲絕對必要條件，此點，想德國在開始大攻擊以前，必巳有充分的把握，</p>
<p>抗戰力的潛在因素</p>
<p>然而戰爭　尤其像德蘇這樣的大决戰，僅依數字而作表面的觀察，到底不能明瞭其最後的歸趨，其問尙有潛在的動因，三年末蘇聯的頑强抗戰，即其明證，耶蘇聯有：</p>
<p>（一）潛在的工業生產力；</p>
<p>（二）國民有國防戰爭的鬥志，</p>
<p>以上物心兩方面的動因，中立國的蘇聯通對此點特別强調，蘇聯目前軍事之顯著的窘狀，已經削低了發揮共濟在動因之力的水準，</p>
<p>如此看來，蘇聯在今夏其軍事力至少已面臨着全面的危機，遠是無可諱飾的事實，轉變世界歷史的關鍵之一，即可見之於未來東部戰綫的烽火中，（翔：譯自四月十九日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>日大使館發言人　廣田談話　述英美外交陰謀</h3>
<p>日大使館發言人廣田洋一，昨在招待外籍新聞記者之常會席上宣稱：我人觀於昨晨倫敦傳來消息，謂蘇聯已與波蘭流亡政府斷絕外交關係，及最近消息，謂駐赫爾新基之美使館大部人員與家屬，巳前往瑞典京城，而知素以大西洋憲章爲屏障，而以歐洲小國爲犧牲品之反軸心國陰險外交政策，巳暴露無遺。廣田謂上項消息，足以反映美政府允應蘇聯要求，以示撫慰之政策，蓋處此惡劣環境下，英美勢必依允蘇方之一切要求，以期拉攏作戰，而蘇波斷絕外交關係，亦足反映蘇聯堅決以完遂其攫奪歐洲邊境小國土地之野心。廣田繼稱；大西洋憲章無非反軸心國用以引誘歐洲弱小民族之餌，然英美應允蘇聯要求實現之日，或即爲發軔大西洋憲章各國侵犯該憲章的神聖之日。故該憲章之成爲廢紙，僅係時間問題。同時歐洲弱小民族，素唯該憲章是賴，到了那時，亦當領略陔憲章之小可靠與前途無望。總之，英美正利用該憲章藉以自肥，歐洲小國姑且不論，重慶與印度將遭受最冷酷之犧牲，共理昭彰，固不必我人費詞云。</p>

<h3>勝利的科學（三）</h3>
<p>日本在大東亞戰爭中，陸海軍所以取得大戰果的原因，不僅是將士英勇盡忠報國所致，且也不能不歸功於供給戰塲的飛機，坦克車，槍砲，各種優秀科學兵器，以及糧秣，藥品，建設器材等等。陸軍方面，對於這類勝利兵器的發明家會頒發過第二次陸軍技術有功獎章，茲把到得獎章者，以及主要發明家介紹於次：（濤：譯自四月十七日東京每日新聞）</p>
<p>關於軍用食糧的設計：陸技師小山榮二，橋本芙一，鈴木猛雄，以及協力者：</p>
<p>飢餓的人是不能作戰的，於是就不能忽視戰爭和食糧的重要關係。同時日本的作戰指導方針並不是消極的防禦，而是積極的進攻和前進。是遠離兵站綫，在一片在洋的孤島上，在人烟稀少的高山峻嶺間，皇軍僅靠携帶的口糧要維持許多天。於是就必須對於携帶輕便營養極大的，味美可口的粉醬與紛醬油，盡速大量製造，這樣才對於軍隊的「食」問題得到解決和保證。要知道，食糧也是武器。</p>
<p>糧秣總廠的小山，橋本，鈴木之技師共同合作，間時得到他人的協力幫忙，而發明毒水探知器，粉醬油製造裝置，戰塲製醬法，利用饄敗菌特別快連製醬法等。他們完成了日本人特具的必要軍用食糧之設計。現在這類方法，無論在內地補給廠，也無論在戰地補給廠，都在積極採用着，對於提高戰鬥力是具有很大的供獻。中日戰爭後當作醬油「精」使用的日本軍用醬油，在長期保存上或在大量生產上都很不適宜，所以三位技師在民國十九年，買來一些德國貨，經過不斷研究，加以不斷的改良，終於發明了優秀的糧本式裝置。當時對於醬的釀造仍然還需要廣大的設備與充分的時間，其製法也很複雜，那末在戰塲上使用就有些不大合適。然而今後的戰爭必須是就地自給自足的。煞費苦心於利用當地物資和簡便製造方法，繼過廢寢忘食的不斷研究，而終於大功吿成。當歡呼成功拍案叫絕的時候，而竟製出醬般的醫油，後又經過幾許努力，克服萬難，而完成了利用戰地炊具與當地物資的巧妙戰時製造法。解決了大東亞戰爭時代食物就地自足自給的困難問題。最近在緬甸，用這種方法不到十七天竟作出比國內市塲上出售的醬油還要好的。士兵們並不知道這是當地出品，而努力加餐以待明日的戰爭。同時對於就地釀造上絕對必要的水，也需要一番檢查，於是發明了毒水探知器。這對於就地自足自給上是有莫大供獻的。</p>
<h3>體育　排球聯賽處揭幕　蘇聯勝白隊　女組靑隊勝—西靑紅</h3>
<p>市體育會與中靑年會聯合主辦之上海公開排球聯賽，於昨晚在八仙橋中靑健身房揭慕，觀者達千餘人，首塲乙一部俄童克空隊，二塲乙二部公安挫奧林匹克，繼之女子組登塲，靑隊對西靑紅，首盤西靑紅以二千一對十三勝，靑隊於二盤中亟起直追，以二十一對十八力扳一盤，末盤靑隊又以二十一對十三再捷，總結二對一靑隊敗西靑紅，壓軸甲組白隊對蘇聯，戰來緊張萬分。首盤白隊下馬施威，以二十一比十八吿捷，不料蘇聯突趨活躍，竟以二十一對十七，二十一對十五連下兩盤，反敗爲勝，結果蘇聯以二比一勝白隊。</p>
<p>昨日本報發報時間七點　十分</p>
<h3>經濟界　評言　安定物價的要訣</h3>
<p>公定物品價格，固然是一件安定物價的重要工作。可是，必須根據科學方法，折衷至當，不偏不倚，纔可得到各方合作和美滿的結果。否則，公價自公價，黑市自黑市，往往有名無實，徒以造成黑市猖獗的局面。目下上海市上最不良之現象，即凡屬限價的物品，往往不易購得，店舖明明有此物品而深閉固拒，諉爲缺貨，可說限價愈嚴，物品愈缺。不但影響市民生活，使消費者感受十分痛苦，並且使生產者亦受到甚大之困難，似非獎勵努力生產之道。故上海有許多廠商固然以原料缺少，無法開工，但亦有一般狡點之廠商，明明積有原料亦不願開工。因爲原料暴漲以後，即使開工，反不如積存或販賣原料之獲利宏大，則經營工廠者，亦何必自尋煩惱？故今後當局，如果規定物品限價，應該根據工廠之成本會計與一切開繳，不可過分提高，更不宜過分壓低，此安定物價之要訣，似値得當局的研究與討論。</p>
<h3>全力推進共榮圈金融滙兌　日本銀行副總裁來滬　後向日記者發表談話</h3>
<p>日本銀行副總裁澁澤敬三氏，爲視察國府參戰後之中國經濟狀况，最近特由日本乘機來滬。二十六日下午五時三十分，接見日籍記者發表談話，該氏在華的將勾留一月，定下月初赴京，然後取道蚌埠，北京，天津返日。以下爲其談話：</p>
<p>余視察中國尙爲初次，此番來華目的，在於考察華中，華北之實際情形，與中日關係當道交換意見。日本期待於中國者甚大，至於經濟方面，我日本銀行願盡最大努力助成中備券之發展。</p>
<p>中日經濟提携，在資金方面亦有顯著進步，例如與正金艱行之借款問題，即爲資金合作之一證，將來東亞共榮圈內之物資交流，可望促進，同時尙有滙兌問題，當以嶄新之理想推進共榮圈之金融匯兌政策。</p>
<p>其中儲備銀行，聯準銀行所負之任務極大，日本之戰時經濟體制逐步準備，五大中心產業之增產開發計劃，與集中資金運用有同樣之進步，任何部門，均有超過預料之良好成績。（四月二十七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>滬區所得稅　征收情況</h3>
<p>財政都所得稅處上海區征收局，自對於市區所屬範圍內之各類所得稅予以調整後，征收方面，極爲順利，去年（卅一年）度第一類營利所得稅，及第三類各種利息所得稅，巳於上月一日起始開征，迄最近止，聞申報繳納稅款者，已達八百六十餘萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，該局近開始征收第二類薪給報酬所得稅，舉凡自由職業及其他從事各業而設有事務所者，按所得稅條例規定，應將上年度（卅一年）其薪給報酬所得塡表申報，茲聞該局已發出通知書，限期申報，以憑核定稅額。</p>
<h3>四底比期已屆　行莊辦理信用放款</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊爲審愼辦理四底信用放款，以免助長投機囤積，決依照兩業公會通過之限制放款新辦法辦理後，對於四底到期之信用長期款，雖無確實統計，惟估計至少在五千萬元以上。凡不適合法令及限制新辦法者，一律通知於四底前收還。惟信用素著之公司行號老戶頭，允予通融辦理。此後新放款以各業公司行號，從事生產事業者爲限，並必須殷實之保證人及訂立放款契約，保證到期後本息完全淸償。頃因四底比期巳屆，所以各業與各行莊接洽信用放款問題甚爲忙碌，因行莊對申請者之用途特別嚴格，同時並實施緊縮，故新放款成交者爲數不多。是期新放軟期最長爲六個月，到十月底爲期，四底之整個金融雖依然穩定，惟銀根因四底緊縮放款關係尤緊云。</p>
<h3>交通銀行等籌劃　舉辦農村放款</h3>
<p>交通銀行等爲協力政府推進農業增產計劃之實施，決以交行爲孩心，組織「農村放款銀行團」，從事低利率之農村放款。此項放款限於農民借貸以之購買農具，肥料，種籽等用途。現在交行對於農村經濟之調查事務，業已吿一段落，大致於下月（五月）初即可開始貨放。貨放時銀行與各淸鄕區之合作社合作，詳細計劃正在擬訂中。</p>
<h3>讀者論壇　上海工商業的新階段與其當前急務</h3>
<p>— 弋人</p>
<p>此次全國高業統制總會的設置，其目的無疑地是在於協助國府推行戰時經濟政策，而在中日工商業平等互惠的密切配合下，首先使物資交流更趨圓滑化，期以統制物價，增加生產，安定民生。</p>
<p>所以說現階段是上敵工商業的新階段。這一附段是以國府參戰後戰時經濟政策之確立。以及目主的商業統制之實施爲其特點的。</p>
<p>在道一個新階段中，上海的工商業正面臨着一個緊急而且重要的仟務，那便是如何『吸收游資，從事增產』的任務。</p>
<p>物價的高漲，巳使一般人民有不騰負担之苦，現在的『無物不漲，無市不黑，已使民不了生，因此而使人民對於國家通貨失去了信任心，更足成爲國府推行戰時經濟政策的莫大障礙與阻力，故積極地毅然地抑平物價，安定民生，實爲當前　基本最首要的任務。至　辦法，不外是『穩定幣値』，『增加生產』，『取締囤秋」三者，自從日本政府一再申明不變更軍票與儲備票之比率的決心，及戰時物資移動取締暫行條例之公佈，芷說明了在客觀上已經具備一切十分優良的條件，而主要的問題，則在於主觀的努力。</p>
<p>目前顯然存在着兩個必須糾正的主觀上的弊病：首先是由於一部分購買力的過剩，及一部份孵買力的不足，而這一部份過剩的購實力正被運用於收買工業原料及工業生產品之囤積，致使物價成爲無原則的在漲不已。第二是上海工業界的不景氣，生產的極度萎縮，致使工業生產品供不應求，這都是物價暴漲的一個重要因素。究其原因，不外是由於大部份的工商業者的偏狹的見地及短視的眼光和僥倖的心理所致。</p>
<p>因此，在商業統制總會旣經成立以後，上海所有的工商業界與銀錢業界必須消滅相互間的利益上的矛盾，而變爲和哀共濟的合作，把過去　狹的見地及短視的眼光和僥倖的心理，澈底予以糾正與掃除，再進一步運用全部剩餘的資金，來從事工業和農業的生產和再生產。例如最近所實施的限制緊縮放款及滙票承兌和票據貼現之種種新辦法，雖然都是比較消極的辦法，但亦不失爲防止利用資金助長投機囤積之一個新的措施，若要完成此一新階段之首要任務，以使中國的經濟趨於復興，民生趨於安定，還有待於上海工商界銀錢界的努力。（完）</p>
<h3>李權時談　消除投機囤積之風　採取標本兼治辦法　決心澈查根治囤緊緊縮通貨增加生產</h3>
<p>國府當局前鑒於滬市物價飛漲，漫無止境，影響民生至鉅，故爲抑平物價安定民生計，特派財政部决長陳之碩，實業部次長袁愈佺來滬，會同市政府秘書長趙尊嶽，商統會監理官陳允文，散查投機囤精奸商，嚴厲懲處，目前對於銀錢業放款客戶承借數額，及支付情形，曁各倉庫囤積物品堆存狀况，仍在繼續澈查中。中央社記者特走訪中國經濟研究會李權時氏，承發表關於消除投機囤積意見如下。</p>
<p>決心澈查兩積鉅商</p>
<p>查物價高漲，爲戰時不可避免之事實，此種狀態　同係戰時所必然之事；但漲勢之迅速，乃爲資產階級者循環囤積，使市面物資求過於供，人民所需之物資，已被囤戶收藏把握流通，需要者不得不以高價雖買，因此生活負担加重。此在資產家固不足爲慮，但在一般薪水階級之平民，則苦不堪言。現在所有囤戶，不獨擁有鉅資者紛起而爲之，卽手中稍有餘蓄者，亦均在競購物資，觀此情勢，物價漲風當益趨沸騰，故欲期消除囤積居奇，抑平物價，應採標本兼治辦法，實地去作。（一）治本辦法，須決心澈查囤積商人，使每一囤積貨物者，無論大囤戶小囤戶，均須依法處治，及勒令平價出籠，袪除徇情之嫌，希望今後澈查囤戶工作，繼續進行，下最大決心，根除囤積之風。</p>
<p>緊縮通貨增加生產</p>
<p>（二）治標辦法，則爲緊縮通貨，增加生產。因目前囤積之趨勢，係浙資過剩，物資來源缺乏。故爲協助消除囤積投機之宏效，應收縮通貨，使銀錢業不得以過剩之遊資，投放囤積貨物之用途，以減少囤戶之資力。一方面由政府金融機關，引導游資投入農村，辦理農貸，調劑農村經濟，努力增加生產，在鄉村使米麥棉及雜糧等產量增加，在城市縣鎭使工廠原料搜購運輸便利，以期增加工業品產量，俾戰時物資運用裕如，軍需民需俱感供應平衡。以上兩種標本兼治辦法，如能實現，則囤風當可消除，物價亦可持久抑平。</p>
<h3>中國通貨問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 今村忠男著</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>大家以爲中國　經濟是特異的存在，而且是極複雜的，這是由於上述的前提條件不同所致，實在是極單純的動向。緣中國人對於經濟狀况的觀念是單純的，中國人是單純的思想，單純的行動。一般日本人或是中國人，知職階級，認爲探究原理乃自尋煩惱。其實一個經濟事業，羅列多種原因是極平常的，可是一想到「自尋煩惱」，就會提不起研究興緻，甚至根本原因何在也不明白。考察中國的經濟事業，先要分析一切前提條件的差別，然後研究其單純的經濟法則，這樣就容易理解，再根據單純的法則，那末如何施策是輕而易舉了。</p>
<p>例如物價騰貴，中國人對於起因在物資方面的漲價，說道：「這是物價的勝貴」，對於起因在通貨方面的漲價，說道：「這是通貨價値的跌落。」就其給果觀之，物價的騰貴，即就是通貨價値的但落，但是像這次起因於物資方面的物價騰實，中國人就說：「是物價的騰貴，不是通貸價値的低落。」把通貨價値低落和物價騰貴，劃分區別，採用所謂原因論，認爲這次通貨的對外價値，並未跌落，對於通貨的信用也很良好，所以目前的物價騰貴，並不是通貨方面的原因，所以不能說是通貨價値跌落，今日的物價騰貴，是因爲海外所來的進口品减少，生產工業，尙未復興，物資漸漸缺乏，造成在漲，所以這是：「物價騰貴」，以上這種見解是多　單純。</p>
<p>關於內地都市的物價騰貴，據內地人士的意見，他們多用下面的簡軍看法，認爲：「這是因爲上海物價騰責所引起。假使上海物價跌落，則內地物價亦能低落。」關於土產物價，農民的答語是這樣：「買進來的東西貴了，所以賣出去的東西也貴了，土產的漲價，就是爲了這個原因，沒有別的理由」這可見得農民的觀念，還未脫除物物交換經濟之域，例如販賣一百元的生產物資，能够得到一百元的代價，能夠買到一百元生活物資，那末物價給使高漲，農民還是要維持這個比率，如果一百元的生產物資，換不到一百元代價的生活物資，他們就要提高生產物資的價格。可顯得中國人的行動是多麼單純。例如對於短少的解說，認爲是貨幣敷量對於物資數量不能平衡所致，祗要收縮通貨數量，物價就能下游。但是在「物資少而漲價」的單純思想上，唯有的接對於物資的施策，才會立刻　效，對通貨方面的施策，物價是不易下澆的。</p>
<p>總之觀察中國察中國經狀況，或者欲行施策的塲合，先要分析其前提條件的差　性，必須明確的認淸，否則徒勞而無功。（雲　：譯自四月廿六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>辦事業的精神　實幹·硬幹·苦幹</h3>
<p>— 賈乃文</p>
<p>一個人往往想挑選簡便而有利的事做，對繁複較難的，則置之不顧，讓他人去做；有時覺得十分容易的事，以爲太不値得了，又不願幹。結果，弄得空虛浮華，彷徨岐途，永遠不能前進，成了時代的落伍者。像這樣的人，世界上眞不知有多少呢！</p>
<p>要消除這種人類的通病，那需先要把有實幹，硬幹，苦幹的精神。</p>
<p>這三幹的精神，是事業的三部曲，缺一不可。所謂實幹，是指一件含有意義的事，切切實實的幹着。反之，就是空幹。有了一件有意義，切實的事，需要勇猛，勤懇的做着，雖遭小失敗，亦所不顧，還是有計劃的繼續榦着，不動搖原來的志意，這就是硬幹。反之，就長瞎幹。有了實幹，硬幹，還需苦幹，不然，功虧一簣，未免枉然。苦幹是事業的終結，亦可說是事業成敗的最後決定點，因爲一事業的成敗還未達到明顯的地步時，往往要經過艱險危難的過程。假使在艱險危難中，努力奮鬥，咬緊牙關，堅忍本位，埋頭苦幹，那就是一個事業的成功者，反之，就是失敗者。</p>
<p>不論是一個聰明，愚庸，不智又不愚的人，祇要不自棄而抱着實幹，硬幹，苦幹的精神，那麼不論幹任何大小事業，都能得到眞眞的成功。像這樣的人，非特對於自己創造出璨爛光明的前途，而且成了時代的最尖端，世界上一切事業推進的原動力。尤其是在這大時代激盪不定的時候，我們的祖國正要求着有實幹，硬幹，苦幹的人來擔任這建立新中國的偉大使命。</p>
<h3>熱忱與人生</h3>
<p>— 羅柴夫</p>
<p>許多人的不快樂，最大的原因便是他缺少了「熱忱」。缺少以「熱忱」的精神去觀察與欣賞自身以外的世界，而把注意力集中在自身的內部，或是自以爲站在高潔的地位，把世人都視作粗鄙淺陋的人，高興就諷笑幾聲，不高興便謾駡幾聲，這種自以爲聰明的人，無異是剝削自己的快樂走向自尋煩惱的路上去。</p>
<p>人生固是短捉的，不足以對件件事都發生熱忱的興趣，但我們要養成的興趣，必須要充滿一生的光陰中，必須自己往外面去尋求材料，把興味化成經騐，經騐越多，享受人生快樂的份量也越多。所以對於外界的事物發生熱忱是可以直接支配人生的快樂的。</p>
<p>譬如有二個人去乘電車，一個人只是無聊的坐着等到了目的地就下去，在這幾十分鐘內”無聊不會給他快樂。另一個就不同了，他吋以趁此機會打　每一個乘客，分析他們的品格，猜測他們的個性，也許就有了趣味的事發現也未可知，但至少那幾十分鍊的時間便由於「熱忱」而在活動中過去了。</p>
<p>對於朋友和事業有熱忱的人，他永遠是一偭被歡迎者，因爲朋友所需要的是眞情的「同情」，而事業所需要的也是有積極性和自信心的熱忱，吾則，一個沒有同情心的人他不會有朋友，沒有積極努力對事業發生濃烈興趣的人，他也不會得到成功。</p>
<p>我希望每一個人的到世界上來，就如一隻活潑的貓走進一間陌生的屋子內一樣，對於周圍的環境似乎都是些可驚奇的事物，充滿了熱忱去追求廣泛的知識，充實我們的人生，追求人生應有的快樂。</p>
<h3>隨便談談</h3>
<p>— 呂莘</p>
<p>人們都歡喜成功，不歡喜失敗。但是，却不知道沒有失敗，天下又安有成功？而且一件事沒有經過失敗，沒有經過困難，（也就是沒有經過奮鬥。）試問這成不成一件偉大的事？有沒有成功後的樂趣？因此，我希望世上的人，多去找尋失敗，這樣，在將來這件事成功以後，方有更多的欣喜。</p>
<p>人們又都歡喜便宜，不喜吃虧。但是，又不知道沒有吃虧，又安能有便宜？自己便宜，人家吃虧了又何如？因此找又希望人們，少找使宜，也就是少有吃虧。</p>
<p>每一個人又都歡喜有一個夢想的天國，時時歎息着說環境不好。可是，他不知道沒有不好，又怎能有優美的表現。譬如說罷，現在我們過着這樣困苦的生活以後，你就更能想像出歌舞昇平的世界的可愛，也就是更增加你爭取的勇氣。假使，人的一生就生活在歌舞昇平的世界中，這生活又將是怎樣的平凡啊！因爲你根本不知道歌舞昇平的可愛，而認爲理所當然。因此生活也就成了一隻猪般的怠隋，「時勢能造英雄，英雄能造時勢。」這的確是至理名言。</p>
<p>人們又都懷着一顆自私的心，希望人家幫我忙，不喜我幫人家的忙，所：「拔」毛而利天下者不爲也。」只願看看人家的跌倒，而不願自己多跨一步崎嶇的路去引援。</p>
<p>人們又懷着一顆不知足的心，有了飯吃想菜吃，有了菜吃想肉吃，却不知道沒有吃時的渴望，徒懷着得隴望蜀之心，永遠沒有滿足的時候。</p>
<p>人們又歡喜養鳥飼魚，認爲是件高雅之事，但是却不知道假使自己也一旦被人鎖在一售狹的籠內而給其他的動物欣賞的時候，又將是怎樣的難過。</p>
<h3>時勢與英雄</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>「時勢造英雄，」與「英雄造時勢，」這是二句老話。倒底時勢是英雄創造出來的呢？抑是有時勢而產生英雄呢？我以爲二者都有密切的關係。換句話說，就是英雄能造時勢，而時勢亦能造英雄。</p>
<p>先說「時勢造英雄，」英雄是時代的產物，是從眞實的世界中發現出來的，並非是天上降下來的。因此，當時代奔騰澎湃，烽火四起的時候，英雄由人民隊伍中挑選出來。</p>
<p>由上面的理論看來，英雄是時代的產物，必然無疑的。在過去的歷史中，也很容易找到。</p>
<p>我們知道秦始皇是一個英雄，（有許多的書上說不是，這裏且不管。）他統一六國，這是因爲當時的經濟基礎起了變動，商業資本已到相當發達的時候，造成統一是必要的局面，並非只依始皇的威風而已。</p>
<p>這就是說「時勢造英雄。」但一面眞理是不成的，否則英雄是受歷史的支配，絲毫無干涉歷史的能力。所以，我們就進一層的說明「英雄造時勢」的理由。</p>
<p>我們知道英雄是由人民隊伍中挑選出來的。因此，無論心理，智慧，眼光都較常人高一等。尤其是分析和綜合的能力，更爲需要。所以，社會的發展，時代的進展，都是靠英雄推動的。這就是說「英雄造時勢」了。</p>
<p>英雄是受人崇拜的，難道自己沒有做英雄慾望嗎？</p>
<p>朋友，我吿訴你：認淸時代，把握社會動向，雖然受時勢與環境的通迫，也不怕它，還要創造時勢，戰勝環境，這才是眞正的「時代英雄」呢？</p>
<h3>電車賣票三部曲</h3>
<p>— 仲徽</p>
<p>第一部</p>
<p>車子將停到站前，人羣蜂擁上去，孩子喊，大人叫，好像逃難似的恐怕失散了。任憑什麼人，不管身分，道德，你推我擠的，跟著人羣搶上車。進到車廂裏，除了身旁擠着的人，脚旁的菜，米袋之外，就是賣票先生的尷尬面孔。</p>
<p>「票子，票子，喂！銅鈿摸出來！」賣票的喊，一方面向乘客討僓似的要錢。</p>
<p>一個乘客付他三角，「同孚路」，賣票的接過錢，給他一張二角的票子，笑着說：「對不起！」乘客看看票子，一聲沒響。另一個西裝靑年嚷起來，「喂！賣票！這是幾角頭票子？」</p>
<p>「謝謝儂，對勿起！」賣票陪笑着說。</p>
<p>「勿可以，掉一張，儂公司裏阿有規矩　？」</p>
<p>賣票的笑容立刻收去，打着揚州腔低低的駡：×他媽媽！」換了一張票子。接着又向別人嚷：「票子，乘車總規要買票，快點摸出來！」他擠到一羣帶着米袋的孩子婦人面前。他一個一個的收錢。並不給票子。</p>
<p>「喂！票子沒有給我！」</p>
<p>賣票凶狠狠的「一天到晚乘電車，不懂規矩！等一等，曉得吧！」一羣窮朋友向他貶貶眼！</p>
<p>第二部</p>
<p>靠着車門旁的一個長衫乘客說：「賣票！找頭找得來，要下車啦。」</p>
<p>賣票的愕然說：「什麼？你付多少錢？」</p>
<p>「咦！希奇！給儂十塊頭鈔票，買三角票子。」他把票子一揚。</p>
<p>「這班車子並沒有客人付我十塊頭票子呀！」賣票說：</p>
<p>「豈有此理，勿找銅鈿，阿是公司裏格規矩！」</p>
<p>兩人爭起來，車門沒人開，要下車的嚷着。結果一個查票的跑上來。</p>
<p>「是的，我看見這位先生付脫一張十元鈔票。」一個客人說。</p>
<p>「我亦看見的！」身旁的又一個客人說。</p>
<p>「這位客人將上來就付脫了。」一個西裝朋友說。</p>
<p>賣票的臉漲得通紅，「眞見鬼！」現在證人這麼許多，眞是有口難辯。香栗的只得侖令賣票的付九元七角給這位先生。這客人接過錢，嘴裏還嘰嘰咕咕的下車去。過了一站，這幾個證人亦都陸續下車去。</p>
<p>第三部</p>
<p>電車由靜安寺開起來。車上的人擠得喘不過氣來，這次賣票的並不速駡帶嚷的死命的關車鬥，他只說：「進來的，軋到裏廂去，向寡軋！」人不斷的向　進，小小的車廂，已經成了過飽的現象。結果還是車下的查票勉强把車門關上。車子開起來，賣票的在人堆裏擠來擠去一個個收錢。見到運米的婦人小孩，一句話亦沒有。見了有些難纏的人，便說：「劉不起，謝謝儂！」結果一車的人，一張票子沒有。</p>
<p>「喂！銅鈿收去了，票子呢？」</p>
<p>「咦！好像收房錢一樣！」</p>
<p>大家這樣大聲說，賣票的只做沒聽見，卻不斷說着噱頭：「這樣軋。夜飯可以省了！」或是「這樣軋！明天車裏搭個閣樓才好！」</p>
<p>車子到了，乘客像水般的擁出來。不意車屷前六着一個日本便　裝先生，每一個乘客要票子。第一個沒有票，第二個沒有，第三個還沒有……乘客反血慌張起來，賣票的臉色亦變了。日本查票當時便把賣票拖到簽票去。其初乘容一嚇，隨後便大笑起來。好像大家作了一齣戲，現在閉慕了。</p>
<h3>燈下集</h3>
<p>— 海倫</p>
<p>理論與事實完全是二件事，若單有理論，而不脚踏實地去幹，則理論是永遠不會成事實的，等於一張不兌現的支票，所以我們要養成「說了就做」的習慣。</p>
<p>勤儉是生命之舵，它能帶我們進入快樂的境界，雖然，在起初有些苦痛，但是，它却給我們永久的安樂。怠惰呢？却相反，它是給我們暫時的快樂，優閒。但是要引我們到滅亡的境界，受永遠的苦痛。社會服務</p>
<h3>減少女子消費　應該自己學習縫紉</h3>
<p>— 誠恒</p>
<p>這年頭，上海的顧綠莊，服裝公司，這般的多，中西成衣舖又到處皆是，他們的裝璜及生活費，大半由於我們女子所供給，他們這種消費，一年的統計當很可觀，倘使我們大家自己來做，自已來繡，自已來縫，自己來紉，那末對於固人，對於家庭，不是可以减少很多的消費嗎！</p>
<p>有一天，我由朋友的介紹，帶我到中華女子縫繡傳習所主參觀，當我一走進門就能夠聽得機聲軋軋，見到姊妹們努力工作的情况。一間寬大的塲所，安置着十餘架新白縫衣機，被十餘位小姐佔有着，皮的碼尺，在各位小姐精細計算下，剪成了一件件時髦的新裝，各色的緞面，在機上不斷的推動着，那美妙細巧的圖案，就被姊妹們的聖手完成了。更有一位敎導員，在姊妹羣中，不停地指點，敎剪，敎總，敎繡，我看他們一個個的面上，都充滿快活的情緒。</p>
<p>據那位朋友說，傳習所的主任唐哀梅先生，他看到一般靠丈夫過活的太太們，連家裏一點小衣短　都要拿到裁縫那裏去，這實在太說不過去，所以他倡辦了一個機繡傅習所，使婦女們有機會來學習一技之長，退可以减少家庭經濟之消費，進可以增加社會個人的生產。</p>
<p>她第一批招來的舉員們，大多數是苦女和棄婦，在唐校長苦心孤詣的義務敎授，使他們經過六個多月的熟練之後，便能生產造物，唐校長又一個個去爲他們代尋出路，謀求介紹，到今天巳有無數的生產者，由她手下造成，到四處去服務了。</p>
<p>中華縫繡傳習所的宗旨，是養成女子應用的技能，適合社會需要，提倡女子生產事業，不限年齡，有意學習者均得報名，專敎裁剪，機器，縫紉機器，繡花等。授課時候每日（星期日外）上午八時半至十一時半，下午一時至四時。不限稈度，暫定初高二級，各爲三個月畢業。學賽每期一百二十元。期內所裁做的衣物，由學者自由携回，地址牯嶺路派克路口一六八號。</p>
<h3>提倡小手工紡織機</h3>
<p>中國用機器紡織，也祗五六十年的歷史。在採甩機紡以前，乃是手紡手織，這手紡織已解決了數千年人們衣的問題。目下因爲布價昂貴，手紛手織又在農村盛行了。</p>
<p>手紡巳有數千年的歷史，可是墨守成法，很少改良，一人祇紡一頭紗。四年前，國人才有改良手紡機的出現。最先的便是穆藕初氏的紡紗機。該項紡紗機乃用脚踏，機構相當複雜，可是已能紡出十多頭的紗來。以後更有許多人的改進。內地對於這些改良手紡機早已普遍使用。惟江淮一帶，仍少採用。揆其原因，第一便是少人提倡：第二缺乏技術人員對機構作合理之改進。滬上近來亦有人製造簡易手紡機出售，此種手紡機，雖能紡花成紗，然對農村之實際應用以及機構尚有改良之處。友人馬君對此種紡機很有研究興趣，嘗用心研摩，巳造成合乎農村之手紡機：爲提處手紡機普遍應用起見，馬君頗願與有志手紡者共同研究，如有意置辦者，更可代爲設計。接洽處：麥枴路四九一號馬君。每日下午七時後或星期日。（瞿尊一）</p>

<h3>Shift in the Center of Gravity of the World War Situation</h3>
<p>The end of the bitter fighting in Tunisia is only a matter of time. The eyes of world strategists and war situation observers have begun to shift to the Mediterranean region. The battle for "Who is the master of the Mediterranean" will undoubtedly be the second act of the world war in 1943.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean is a vital link between Asia, Europe, and Africa. For thousands of years, the struggles of various nations with the Mediterranean as their stage have been aimed at controlling the Mediterranean in order to manipulate the politics and economy of the three continents. Britain has long wanted to make the Mediterranean a pond in its own golden valley, excluding the power of other nations, and exclusively enjoying its economic and even political privileges. Especially since the Battle of La Hogue in 1692, it has grasped the hegemony of the Western Mediterranean, and then attempted to grasp the entire Mediterranean in order to establish its dominance over the European continent and the relationship between the three continents. And the Mediterranean coastal countries, such as Italy, France, Turkey, and Spain, all hope to obtain the sovereignty of the Mediterranean in order to protect their military and economic security. This strategic situation has even more important significance today. Especially since General Rommel flew to the African battlefield and the Axis forces occupied Crete as their center, the Axis forces that rushed from Libya to Egypt, if they captured Cairo and controlled the Suez Canal, while at the same time the Axis forces on the eastern front marched south from the Caucasus and converged in West Asia, the Mediterranean would become an inland sea for Germany and Italy; and more importantly, at that time, through the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, the wars in East Asia and Europe and Africa would be integrated. Due to various accidental events, especially the betrayal of the Darlan faction in France, the landing of American troops in Africa, and the westward advance of British troops, this situation has been blocked. However, from the perspective of the entire war situation, the Axis forces must not slacken their determination to defend the Mediterranean. Because only by exerting all their strength to ensure their dominance over the Mediterranean can they maintain the strategic superiority of the Axis powers on the European battlefield and launch their offensive against Africa and West Asia again.</p>
<p>At present, the situation in the Mediterranean seems to be favorable to the anti-Axis forces on the surface. Once the war in Tunisia ends, the British, American, and French rebel forces may control the entire southern coast, posing a major threat to Italy, the southern coast of France, and Greek territory. However, up to today, the Axis forces still maintain a considerable superior position in the Mediterranean. The Apennine Peninsula, which protrudes into the Mediterranean, is, in terms of terrain, a victorious foundation for Mediterranean operations. From this peninsula and between Sicily and Bizerte in Tunisia, the Axis forces maintain an unshakable line of communication, completely invalidating Malta, the main strategic stronghold of the United Kingdom, and ensuring the persistence of the war in Tunisia. In addition, since the Axis forces entered the southern coast of France, they have been actively engaged in defense facilities, which not only suppressed the brewing of internal rebellions in France, but also became a powerful guarantee for Spain to consistently adhere to its position. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the main strategic bases such as the Dodecanese and Crete are all in the hands of the Axis forces, preventing the anti-Axis forces in Cyprus from operating, and at the same time becoming the basis for Turkey's firm neutrality. In summary, the overall situation in the Mediterranean shows that the Axis forces still occupy a superior position. When the United Kingdom and Italy attempt to further expand the war situation, they must first hesitate because of this established fact. Therefore, even the most lighthearted and optimistic strategists in the United States have recently had to point out that if the war in Tunisia ends, the anti-Axis forces will have to engage in bitter fighting in the Mediterranean for at least six months before there is a possibility of launching a "second front" towards the European continent.</p>
<p>Regardless of the future trend of the world war situation, in addition to the real situation in the Mediterranean, we must also recognize that the following two battlefields are always of decisive significance. The first battlefield is the Eastern Front between Germany and the Soviet Union. The muddy season following winter is coming to an end. In the past few months, the Axis forces have been committed to preparing for the spring and summer offensives, avoiding the consumption of combat power in the war, and striving to increase new combat power in the rear. The Battle of Kharkov was a small test. The launch of a major offensive in the future is expected. During the same period, the Soviet Union adopted an offensive stance. Therefore, whether the consumption of combat power and the reorganization of new combat power in the rear can be compared with the Axis forces is ultimately a question. Therefore, we can assert that the future battles on the Eastern Front are no less important than the Mediterranean or other battlefields. Without a sure-win premise on the Eastern Front, the United Kingdom and the United States will never be able to launch the so-called "second front." This is very obvious.</p>
<p>The second battlefield that will determine the future war situation is in the Pacific. We must solemnly point out that, no matter how cleverly the United Kingdom and the United States argue, in the past year or more, the reason why the anti-Axis forces have not been able to open up a "second front" in Europe is not so much due to the contradictions between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or various other reasons, but rather to say bluntly that it is due to the lack of strength of the United Kingdom and the United States. And the main reason for the lack of strength of the United Kingdom and the United States is that, in addition to the fact that almost all of the United Kingdom's military force has been concentrated in the Mediterranean, the more important thing is that most of the United States' combat power has been dragged down in the Pacific. Now, while strategists and newspapers in the United Kingdom and the United States are extravagantly talking about "future war situations" and "second fronts," they have to pay special attention to Japan's threat to the Southwest Pacific and even the United States mainland. The panicked cries of "Australia is about to be invaded" and that the Japanese army will conquer all of "New Guinea" can further prove this point, and the crux of the anti-Axis forces' loss of confidence in the future war situation lies.</p>
<p>In short, the shift in the center of gravity of the world war situation has obviously made the Mediterranean a battlefield of renewed focus for people around the world, while the Eastern Front and the Pacific battlefield will always have a decisive force on the world war. We East Asian nations should especially enhance our confidence in victory in this new war situation, and strive for the sacred goal, and never allow ourselves to be complacent and evade responsibility.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Government Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with Poland: First Exposure of Rifts in the Allied Camp</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th - Moscow Radio announced last night that the Soviet government has severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile of General Sikorski in London. This is the first public rupture within the so-called "Allied" camp. Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th</p>
<p>According to Moscow Radio: Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov issued a note verbale to the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roman, on the 26th, announcing the Soviet government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government. After receiving the note verbale, Ambassador Roman departed from Moscow for Kuybyshev. The contents of the Soviet government's note verbale to Poland are as follows: (1) The attitude of the Polish government-in-exile towards the Soviet Union is obviously abnormal, and it despises all the rules and normal procedures between allied countries. (2) At the time when hostile rumors about the Soviet government massacring Polish officers and soldiers in Smolensk were rampant in the international community, the Polish government-in-exile also took the opportunity to engage in hostile propaganda, and attempted to expand the incident with its newspapers. (3) The Polish government-in-exile not only demanded that the Soviet government clarify the incident, but also further requested the International Red Cross in Geneva to investigate the truth of the incident. In view of the above, the Soviet government declared the severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Breakdown of Soviet-Polish Relations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - Previously, when German troops began fighting with Poland in September 1939, Soviet troops took the opportunity to invade Poland, seize most of eastern Poland, and incorporate it into their own territory. Regarding this matter, the Polish government-in-exile in London made a serious protest to the Soviet government, but the Soviet government stated that the area originally belonged to the Soviet Union, and was later taken away by Poland based on the Treaty of Versailles, and completely ignored the protest of the Polish government-in-exile. Since then, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland has been in a state of severance. It was not until June 21, 1941, when Germany and the Soviet Union went to war, that the Soviet government attempted to restore diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile. Therefore, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski went to Moscow for negotiations, and as a result, the two countries concluded an alliance. In the treaty, the Soviet government stated that it would respect Poland's sovereignty, and agreed to release Polish prisoners of war to recover lost territories, and that the two armies would cooperate in fighting the German army. After the Soviet army's first winter counter-offensive began, the Soviet Union mobilized all propaganda organs to clearly express its intention to incorporate the old Polish territory into its own territory after the war. Foreign People's Commissar Korniychuk openly denied the existence of the Polish state in Pravda, and the Polish government-in-exile became deeply uneasy, and ordered Ambassador Roman to the Soviet Union to make a serious protest to the Soviet government. At the same time, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski personally came forward and begged the British and American governments to support the post-war guarantee of the borders of old Poland, but the British and American governments, in order to curry favor with the Soviet Union, did not care about it because the time was still early. The Polish government was greatly disappointed with this ambiguous attitude of the British and American governments. It once again questioned the Soviet side, but the Soviet government sent a final ultimatum to Polish Prime Minister Sikorski. As a result, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland encountered a breakdown at this point. On April 22, the German authorities announced that the Soviet secret police had massacred more than 10,000 Polish officers and soldiers in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk. Upon hearing the news, the Polish government was deeply indignant and demanded that the Soviet Union explain the details, but the Soviet government only said that this was fabricated by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and ignored it. As a result, the Polish government entrusted the International Red Cross to investigate the truth, and the Soviet government believed that the "ally" in the anti-Axis camp had been encouraged by Axis officials and had taken hostile actions, so it became angry and broke off relations with Poland out of shame. Judging from the statement issued by the Polish government-in-exile in London on the 16th, it can be seen that the Soviet Union and Poland were really unable to share the same boat.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Polish Government</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - According to a telegram from London: After the Polish government-in-exile severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, in order to decide the government's future attitude, it convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:00 a.m. today, but did not issue any official statement after the meeting. There are still several divisions of Polish troops stationed in Iran, so the relationship between the army and the Soviet army is highly valued by the general public. However, according to observation, because the Polish army is stationed in British army garrison areas, the problem of handling the Polish army after the severance of Soviet-Polish relations may not become serious.</p>
<h3>Washington Expresses Regret Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - According to a Washington dispatch: A U.S. State Department spokesman expressed regret yesterday over the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile. He said, "The U.S. government does not express its opinion on the issue of discord between the two governments, but is deeply saddened to learn of this development."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - The British Foreign Office recently expressed its opinion on the Soviet government's announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Poland, briefly stating that the only countries that are probably satisfied with the incident are the Axis powers, and that this incident can be said to be a victory for Goebbels' propaganda. As for the anti-Axis countries, they do not have any identical relationship with either the Soviet Union or Poland, but only hope to maintain the unity between the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<h3>Identification Work on the Mass Grave Case</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - According to a Havas news report, 500 corpses of Polish officers were exhumed by Kotensenko in mid-April, and the corpses were buried in a hidden place in the forest. Now that the Polish Red Cross has joined the investigation committee, the identification work is proceeding smoothly, and the list of identified corpses has been announced by the German side. The ranks of the victims range from lieutenant to colonel, and they all belong to the army and air force.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Madrid, Spain, 27th - The famous Spanish medical scientist, Professor Bi Jia of Forensic Medicine at Madrid University, has departed for Smolensk to examine the corpses of Polish officers in the mass grave case with many foreign medical experts.</p>
<h3>Jin-Nan Encirclement Battle Nears Completion; War Enters Final Stage</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin-Nan Taihang Mountain front on the 27th, the Japanese army's annihilation battle against the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing forces has entered the final stage. The Chongqing troops in the Linqi Basin and near Lingchuan, Tianjiajing, Badong, and Yaoji are now in a state of complete chaos, surrounded by the Japanese army, and will soon be annihilated. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the Ji-Cha war zone, has not sent reinforcements to preserve his own strength, so the generals and colonels who surrendered to the Japanese army are all indignant. Chongqing is quite dissatisfied with Jiang Dingwen's actions regarding the failure of this battle. Wei Lihuang was criticized by Chongqing for the failure of the Central Plains campaign the year before last, and was dismissed. Jiang Dingwen, director of the Tianshui Xingying, was ordered to succeed Wei Lihuang. With the defeat of the 24th Army Group and the surrender of Sun Dianying, the commander of the newly formed 5th Army, it is expected that Jiang Dingwen will also follow in Wei Lihuang's footsteps and fall into a tragic fate.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin province front on the 27th, the Japanese army in the Jin-Yu province border region issued a battle report at 3:00 p.m. on the 27th, stating that the Japanese army and nearby troops joined forces on the 23rd to encircle the main force of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing forces near Linhong. They inflicted heavy damage on it on the 24th. The Japanese army pursued the defeated Chongqing troops to the mountainous area on the border of the Jing-Ji province, defeated them, and destroyed the Chongqing army's base. The Japanese army achieved considerable results in this operation. As of the evening of the 26th, the investigation results showed that about 3,000 Chongqing troops were killed and 7,000 were captured. A large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. Among the Chongqing troops captured or killed in battle, there were more than a dozen lieutenant generals, including the army commander, etc., which proves that the Chongqing army in that area has been completely on the verge of annihilation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin province front, Lieutenant Imamura of the Goto unit of the Japanese army participated in the battle to capture Linqi, the base of the newly formed 5th Army of the Chongqing forces. According to a statement on the situation of the capture of Linhong and Sun Dianying's surrender, the gist is as follows: The headquarters of the newly formed 5th Army of the Chongqing forces was located in Linqi, and its division headquarters was located in Xizhang Village, south of Linhong. The road from Linhong to Xizhang Village was quite clean. The Japanese army's encirclement operation of Linhong began on the 22nd, so as to echo the southward advance of troops. At that time, a large number of Japanese aircraft also participated in the operation, bombing the Chongqing army's positions fiercely. Although the Chongqing army resisted stubbornly, it finally collapsed after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army, and fled towards Luzhou. At that time, the southward advance of the Japanese army had cut off its retreat, and 20,000 Chongqing troops were surrounded by the Japanese army, becoming turtles in a jar. From the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese army launched an annihilation battle at the same time. After two hours of fierce fighting with the main force of the Chongqing army in Lijiazhai, southwest of Linhong, when the pursuit battle was being carried out, they saw military envoys such as Sun Dianying's chief of staff in the Chongqing army's positions, holding white flags and applying to surrender. At 2:55 p.m. on the 23rd, Sun Dianying surrendered to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th - The Japanese army operating along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway attacked 3,000 troops of Li Xianzhou's 92nd Army of the Chongqing faction, which invaded northward, southeast of Dangshan on the evening of the 25th. Cooperating with the Japanese army that moved out from a certain direction, they launched a fierce annihilation battle, which continued fiercely until the night of the 26th, and achieved great results. The Japanese army's elite units have completely frustrated the attempt of Li Xianzhou's 92nd Army to move to Shandong Province in this campaign. The comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army from the evening of the 25th to the morning of the 27th are recorded as follows: 1,300 corpses of Chongqing troops were left behind, 230 people were captured, and the seized items included 2 mortars, 30 mortar shells, 3 heavy machine guns, 11 light machine guns, 11 grenade launchers, 247 rifles, 50 rounds of ammunition, and 27 pistols.</p>

<h3>Vice President Zhou's Speech in Beijing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th - On the 19th of this month, Vice President Zhou's speech in Beijing was related to the future National Government's policy on local political adjustments. There have been many discrepancies in the telegrams that have been transmitted in recent days. The original manuscript has now been found and is disclosed below: "My previous decision to inspect the north was in the summer of the 29th year of the Republic, which was the time when the National Government returned to the capital, a new era in Chinese history. This time, I have come again at a time when China has declared war on Britain and the United States, a more magnificent period in Chinese history, so I am sincerely delighted. Since the Opium War, China has been exploited and oppressed by Britain and the United States for more than a hundred years. This time, declaring war on the old enemies Britain and the United States is to avenge a hundred years of hatred, wash away a hundred years of shame, and wash away a hundred years of humiliation. It is truly one of the most uplifting days for China. At the same time, thanks to our friendly country Japan for voluntarily abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, the task of abolishing unequal treaties and seeking China's freedom and equality, as instructed by the Founding Father, can be completed. In addition to gratitude, we feel that the future is infinitely bright. Coming here and seeing the Blue Sky White Sun flag flying over the embassy area in Dongjiaomin Lane, the main base of Britain and the United States in China, I cannot help but feel encouraged. However, the remaining forces of Britain and the United States have not yet been eliminated, and the final victory has not yet been achieved. In the future, we must still make efforts and struggle. I believe that in order to complete the sacred mission we bear, we must be united externally and unified internally. The unity of the East Asian Axis countries must be as firm as iron and stone, and each must contribute all human and material resources to the war. Then the surrender of Britain and the United States can be expected, and the victory of the war can be anticipated. As for the country, no matter east, west, north, or south, all forces should be unified in the central government. The concentration of five forces makes it strong, while dispersion makes it weak. If we cooperate with Japan with dispersed forces, our strength will be weak, and the results will be small. If we cooperate with Japan with concentrated forces, our strength will be great, and the results will be significant. Therefore, in order to cooperate effectively with our friendly country Japan, and to make a strong contribution to the Greater East Asia War, China must gradually adjust its fragmented situation and form a truly unified situation before this goal can be achieved. Wise men in China and Japan, with foresight, must have the same feeling. Chairman Wang has never forgotten the food problem in North China, and the central government has never neglected it for a day. North China is the North China of the central government, and the central government is also the central government of North China. The people under the jurisdiction of the National Government, no matter where they are, should share weal and woe, and prosperity and adversity together. In the past, it was only because of lack of power that we were unable to provide more facilities for the welfare of the people in North China, and we feel deeply sorry. In the future, regarding the exchange of materials, the financing of transaction funds, and other issues, if the central government can reach them, it will do its best to provide relief for the people's livelihood in North China. I have not been to North China for three years. This trip is intended to exchange views with the North China authorities and the leaders of the friendly Japanese military and political circles in North China on issues such as stabilizing the people's livelihood in China and enhancing China's war-making power, so that China's responsibility in the Greater East Asia War can be completed, and China's people's livelihood can become increasingly stable. During this visit to Manchuria, I received a warm welcome from all levels of society in Manchuria, for which I am very grateful. Inspecting various places, I witnessed the rapid progress of its various industries, and at the same time expressed my deep respect for the hard work of its authorities. At the same time, I deeply felt the urgency of our country's industrial development."</p>

<h3>Henan Suffers from Drought and Flood, Disaster is Severe; Representatives Go to Beijing to Appeal for Relief; Ministry of Social Welfare Sends Personnel to Investigate and Provide Relief</h3>

<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the Yellow River breached in the 29th year, the counties in eastern Henan have suffered from floods. Last year, locusts and drought caused disaster throughout the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Vast areas were barren for miles, and the starving died on the roads. Since the beginning of this year, during the time between the harvest of old crops and the ripening of new crops, the food panic has become even more serious. The impact has also extended to major cities. It is often heard that people are dying of hunger every day. This is truly the greatest disaster situation in the last ten years. Various local governments in North China and charitable organizations in Peiping and Tianjin have jointly launched relief efforts. However, due to the lack of food, it is only a drop in the bucket and cannot be widely distributed. The Ministry of Social Welfare has received reports that the disaster situation in the area is dire. It has also carefully considered countermeasures, made overall plans, and contacted local authorities in North China and fellow provincial associations in Beijing from Hebei and Henan to launch extensive and universal relief efforts. In recent days, it has convened meetings with relevant parties to discuss and decide on relief methods. Furthermore, the ministry has received a joint telegram from seven gentry members of Shangqiu and Taikang counties in eastern Henan, including Tang Shiyuan, as representatives of the disaster victims, requesting relief. Additionally, Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the Provisional 1st Army of the Border Pacification Headquarters in the Jiangsu-Henan Border Area, has separately forwarded requests for relief to the ministry. These requests have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it is requested that 50,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Bank notes be allocated first for emergency relief.</p>

<h3>A Trial Ride on the Newly Opened Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>The newly constructed Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has finally opened to traffic amid the anticipation of millions. In mid-May of last year, the operation to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was launched, securing the eastern Zhejiang region. Various construction projects have achieved significant progress within this year.</p>
<p>The 175-kilometer newly constructed Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Jinhua to the south bank of the Qiantang River has been completed. This reporter made a special trip to take a trial ride on its maiden voyage. The following is the trial ride report:</p>
<p>…At 6:00 AM, when the sky was not yet fully bright, a "Greater East Asia" train was parked at Jinhua Station, with Chinese and Japanese national flags waving. As the wheels rumbled, the train moved forward, and the cheers of the crowd were deafening. After the train started, looking out over the city of Jinhua, the traces of battle were clearly visible, with bullet holes and gun marks everywhere. Under the strict guard of the Japanese army, public order has been fully restored. This is currently a busy period for agricultural work, and smoke is swirling from the chimneys of every household. Farmers are diligently plowing the fields with water buffaloes. The fields, having been soaked by several heavy rains, are like natural fields. The dark red soil, green wheat, and white flowers are symbols foreshadowing a bountiful harvest. The rural scenery is endless, and the beautiful scenes are beyond description.</p>
<p>…With the sound of wheels whirring, the speed is extremely fast. A military officer in the car pointed to a small mountain on the left and said:</p>
<p>"The area around there was the scene of the fiercest battles." As we looked, the train moved on. The farmers in the fields saw the train coming and raised their hands, cheering "Banzai!" People in the car waved back in enthusiastic welcome.</p>
<p>…At the small stations along the way, flags were hung to welcome the train. The passengers boarding the train were very crowded. The sounds of vendors selling snacks, eggs, and watermelon seeds were noisy. Before long, the train arrived in Yiwu. This place used to belong to Kuaiji Commandery. It was first named Yiwu in the seventh year of the Wude era of the Tang Dynasty. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was under the jurisdiction of Jinhua Prefecture. Now it has a county government. The products include fluorite, coal, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc., and it is one of the main places of origin for Jinhua ham. Most of the Yiwu station has been completed. The side of the waiting hall is piled with fluorite, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. The scenery is pleasant along the way from Yiwu to Suxi, which can be described as "mountains and clear waters." Ancient cypress trees and green pines stand side by side with mountains and rivers, making the people on the Greater East Asia train exclaim at the wonders of nature. The train soon arrived at Suxi. The mountains and rivers are dangerous near here, and the route is winding and difficult to construct.</p>
<p>…From afar, you can already see the scenic area of Taohua Ridge near Zhuji. Soon after, we arrived in Zhuji. Many trains from Hangzhou were already parked here, waiting for the arrival of the Greater East Asia. Our train stopped, and the passengers on both sides greeted each other cordially through the windows. After a while, the Greater East Asia started moving forward again, and the passengers on both trains shouted "Banzai!" to say goodbye. Zhuji was formerly known as Ji Country. Later, because of the presence of the Zhu Mountains and the Ji River, it was renamed Zhuji. Famous local products include fluorite, tea, livestock, ceramics, and tung oil. Just outside Zhuji, you can see the famous Jianshan Mountain. Flat fields and discontinuous hills connect to each other. We also saw a wooden sign with the words "Dongshan" written on it at a small station. Further on, we saw a wooden bridge over a small river with the words "Greater East Asia Bridge" written on it. These words were all written by the Japanese soldiers guarding the railway line. Not far past Jianshan Mountain is Meichi. After a while, we arrived at Meichi, which is the terminus of the first phase of the project. Most of the construction has been completed, and the waiting room and office are very tidy.</p>
<p>…At noon, we arrived at Xiaoshan. Xiaoshan was called Xiling of the Yue Kingdom during the Spring and Autumn period. During the Han Dynasty, it was renamed Yuji County. During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, it belonged to Shaoxing Prefecture. There are long-distance buses from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing to provide transportation. It is said that the highway will soon be extended directly to Ningbo, which will surely promote the exchange of goods in the eastern Zhejiang region. Xiaoshan also produces a lot of products, including cotton, paper, rice, raw silk, tung oil, and livestock. At 3:30 PM, we arrived at the riverbank on the south bank of the Qiantang River. The maiden voyage across eastern Zhejiang in ten hours was completed. It is hoped that this railway line will soon be completed as a major trunk line of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The black smoke of the Greater East Asia train flies across the north and south, which is what we eagerly hope for. This reporter got off the train at the Jiangbian Railway Station, ending the mission of this trip and gaining the reward of witnessing great construction.

<h3>Allied Forces Attack in Three Routes; Tank Battle Unfolds in the Breakthrough; Axis Forces Shorten Lines for More Advantageous Defense; German Counter-Attack on the Pont du Fahs Front Brings Great Victory</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Last night, the German News Agency reported: German Lieutenant General Arnim has shortened his lines in several locations in order to more effectively contain the attempts of the British and American forces to advance towards Tunis and Bizerte. German military personnel are confident about the future development of the Tunisian campaign. Although American General Anderson has joined the battle with a powerful tank fleet, he has made no progress due to the strong resistance of the Axis forces. On Sunday, the Axis forces destroyed a total of 73 British and American tanks. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces also bombed and destroyed 21 British and American trucks in concentrated attacks. Since October 1, 1942, the anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 3,117 tanks on the North African battlefield.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Although the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are small in number, they continue to resist bravely and maintain key positions. The intensity of the fighting in Mejez el Bab and Pont du Fahs on the western front is unprecedented since the start of the Tunisian campaign. According to reports from Algiers, the resistance of the Axis forces has increased. The main force of the British First Army in Mejez el Bab and Pont du Fahs, relying on its large troop strength, has repeatedly attacked the Axis positions. On the night of the 25th, the Axis forces carried out a strategic retreat southeast of Mejez el Bab, transferring to a new and more defensible position. The Axis forces in Bou Arada and Pont du Fahs have also abandoned their salient positions due to the joint attack of the British First Army and the rebel French forces, concentrating their forces in the main positions in that area to prevent the advance of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a military correspondent from the Havas News Agency, an unprecedented major battle is currently underway on the Tunisian front. The anti-Axis forces, with their superior manpower and material resources, are continuously dispatching troops for battle, regardless of the heavy losses, in a manner similar to the Soviet Union. The desperate attempts of the British army to break through have been met with the courageous resistance of the Axis forces. The fighting is now taking place on a shorter line. On Saturday and Sunday, the British First Army launched a fierce offensive in three routes near Mejez el Bab in the middle of the Tunisian front. The first route advanced towards Djebel Ang, the second route (the central force) advanced towards Tebourba, and the third route, the southern route, advanced towards Pont du Fahs. The troops advancing on the central route and the northern flank have been contained, but the southern route has continued to advance and has occupied the village of Koudiat. General Anderson seems to have decided to use all his preparations, especially the tanks, in the southern operation, hoping to capture Pont du Fahs or even Chaghouan at any cost. This move by the enemy threatens the rear of the Axis forces' southern flank, so the German army has launched a large-scale counter-offensive with tank units. The first wave of attacks has been repulsed to the west and northwest of Pont du Fahs, and there was still fierce tank warfare there on the morning of Monday. The British army has continued to put pressure on the Tebourba area, attempting to break through the Axis positions and rush towards Chaghouan, but has not yet succeeded. The British First Army on the left flank south of Cap Serrat in the coastal area, with the help of the American army, has made some progress, but it is strategically insignificant. The rebel French forces and a part of the American army are fighting on Anderson's right flank, but have achieved nothing. The British army's local attacks in the mountainous areas, attempting to penetrate the mountains, have also failed. There have been no major military changes in the southern Tunisian campaign. Anderson has failed to capture the small port of Feshi on the coast. It is expected that the British Eighth Army will resume its offensive in the near future.</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive West of Rostov Fails</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Soviet command is extremely anxious as the German summer offensive approaches. On the 26th, on the Mius front west of Rostov, they suddenly launched a large-scale offensive. After fierce artillery bombardment, they attempted to break through the German positions from the front with tank units as the vanguard. However, after being met with concentrated artillery fire from German field guns and anti-tank guns, they appeared to be overwhelmed and retreated. The Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga and in the Leningrad area also launched small-scale offensives, but they were repelled by the German garrison. At the same time, the German air force's offensive has intensified. On the 25th, they shot down eight Soviet aircraft on the southern front and sixteen aircraft on other fronts in a single day, and inflicted great damage on the Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk and Kuban areas.</p>
<h3>"The Future of the Leap Forward in Policy Towards China" - Japanese Minister Tajiri Publishes Article in Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) Today's Tokyo Shimbun published an article by Japanese Minister to China, Tajiri Aiyi, entitled "The Future of the Leap Forward in Policy Towards China," explaining the vibrant trends in politics, economy, and culture of the new China with the ideals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It strongly argues for thoroughly eliminating Anglo-American national views and Anglo-American thought. At the same time, it points out that establishing a new ideology based on the standpoint of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is an urgent task. The arguments are concise and worthy of attention. The main points are summarized as follows: "Japan's leap forward in its policy towards China is expressed in three aspects: politics, economy, and culture. However, in fact, this policy towards China is by no means a new concept. It has been fully researched and discussed and is already well known to the public. Therefore, rather than calling it a new policy, it is better to say that Japan's policy towards China has entered the practical stage, or that the practice of the policy towards China has leaped forward. The force that prevents Japan from practicing its policy towards China is Anglo-American power. Therefore, Japan can only implement its policy towards China after completely crushing Anglo-American power. From China's standpoint, China can only complete its revolution after removing the greatest obstacle since the Xinhai Revolution, Anglo-American power. At the same time, only when the removal of this obstacle and the completion of the Chinese revolution coincide can Japan begin to practice its policies in good faith, and China can reciprocate Japan's policies and build a new China with the ideals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As mentioned above, the so-called new policy is in fact the vigorously promoted Sino-Japanese relations today, or China's participation in the war, which coincides with the period when Japan is implementing its policy towards China. Therefore, this fundamental significance is often misunderstood by both China and Japan. This is a major issue that people in both countries should recognize anew. As for the policies that Japan is implementing in the political sphere, such as the return of concessions and embassy districts, and the transfer of enemy assets of Anglo-American countries to Chinese management, problems like these and the abolition of extraterritoriality will gradually be implemented. All of the above gives the National Government and the entire Chinese nation a great sense of goodwill and rekindles the spirit and courage of the Xinhai Revolution. This is a fact that we cannot deny. As for economic problems, they are not as simple as politics, and economic problems have a characteristic of immobility. Moreover, because economic problems require considerable equipment, they are not easy to become apparent. However, Japan's true intentions and China's enthusiasm have produced a result, which is the center for the construction and economic revival of the new China. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association in Shanghai in early March, along with the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials, makes the exchange of materials between Shanghai and other places smoother. In the past, Japan carried out various measures to maintain military prices. From now on, the Chinese side will distribute materials themselves in order to promote the purchase of materials. Therefore, the three, purchase, distribution, and a certain degree of processing and manufacturing in Shanghai, are related, and only then can the economic exchange in central China begin to move again. Therefore, if this can be successful, it will make a great contribution to maintaining the price of the Central Reserve Bank notes. At the same time, the goals of the Control Association are progressing in all aspects. On the other hand, it can be seen that the establishment of the Control Association also has a major significance in politics, that is, people in the Shanghai economic community are working together for the revival of the economy and Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, the directors and supervisors of the Control Association are all leading figures in the Shanghai economic community. The Control Association not only receives the guidance of the National Government but also the assistance of Japan from the sidelines. Therefore, this new organization is highly regarded by the general public. At the same time, the economic revival of central China and the strengthening of the National Government have also gained great strength. Some may think that this view seems a bit optimistic, but the economy of Shanghai and central China behind Shanghai can be said to have begun to be rebuilt and strongly promoted. From now on, it still depends on the efforts of people in the Chinese economic community, the proper guidance of the National Government, and the effective assistance of Japan to continue to promote and work harder. When this effort achieves results, and when the anti-effort continues to quickly achieve results, it will be the time when Shanghai's economic position is established throughout China. At the same time, it will not only fundamentally solve the economic problems of central China and northern China, but also have a great impact on the non-peace zone. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic about this, but it is a fact that economic construction has already begun. As for the cultural aspect, the most noteworthy is the publishing industry in Shanghai, which is also in the process of recovery. Moreover, because the publishing industry in Shanghai accounts for 90% of the entire China, it has considerable power. The state of withering and decline after the Sino-Japanese Incident has now gradually disappeared. This is the beginning of a new emerging joint publishing business. Its goal is to improve Chinese culture and communicate with Japan, and the revival of the Chinese publishing industry in a good sense is based on cultural activities and ideological movements centered on Shanghai. Shanghai has already developed as described above, and the rise of events can also be said to be the rise of China and the strengthening of the power of the National Government. It is also the place where the Sino-Japanese problem is solved, and its future is quite optimistic. However, there is still a problem that needs to be considered carefully, that is, when Japan's new policy towards China changes the future Sino-Japanese relations, we should consider the Anglo-American power again, because although the military, political, and economic power of Anglo-American has been driven out of China and Greater East Asia today, can erroneous Anglo-American concepts be eliminated in thought? When Japanese and Chinese people consider Sino-Japanese relations, they often feel the Anglo-American national view and the Anglo-American international concept, or they may accept the Anglo-American national concept without criticism. Is it not a lack of full review of Sino-Japanese relations? I think it is not a simple problem that can be easily reached, but it is a problem that the Japanese and Chinese governments and the public should seriously study and reach a common conclusion. Therefore, I would like to point out here that the clarification of thoughts and the acquisition of new ideas are extremely necessary and urgent.</p>
<h3>On U.S.-Finland Relations, Hull Makes No Explicit Statement; U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Finland Remains in Position</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Washington's attitude towards Finland remains the same as previously declared. Regarding U.S. attempts to mediate peace between Finland and the Allied nations, there is nothing to add. Mr. Hull made this statement in response to inquiries from the press regarding the situation after the partial departure of embassy personnel stationed in Finland.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency): U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Finland, Mr. McClintock, is still in his post, but his wife arrived here yesterday, returning home with the majority of the embassy staff who left Finland earlier last week. Mr. McClintock spoke on the phone with a United Press correspondent stationed in Stockholm on Sunday evening, saying that he remains in his post but declined to comment on the future development of U.S.-Finland relations. It is noted that the U.S. Minister to Finland, Mr. Gunther, has not returned to his post after returning to his country several months ago.</p>

<h3>Review of Soviet War Capacity: Military Production Faces a Critical Juncture; Human Resources Have Reached Saturation</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Toyono, Stockholm, Sweden, 17th) The Axis powers' diplomatic offensive in Europe, centered on the meetings between the leaders of Germany and Italy, as well as Germany, Hungary, Germany, France, and Germany, Romania, etc., as the first step in the practical implementation of the so-called new system of total European war, has attracted great attention. Although this new system of total war includes many broad military, political, and economic issues on both the offensive and defensive fronts, its general trend remains, as Hitler said, a new plan to annihilate the Soviet Union that "determines the fate of Europe." So, when will this great offensive to annihilate the Soviet Union begin? Outsiders do not know, but Hitler naturally has a plan in mind. As for the Soviet Union, how will it respond to this attack, having already exhausted most of its military strength in the great counter-offensive this winter, and how can it complete the "war to defend the motherland"? What is the truth about its war capacity in terms of both material and spirit? What is its strategy? Regarding these questions, foreigners residing in Moscow have almost no way of knowing, and rumors abound. Based on the various information obtained locally, I will attempt to conduct a detailed review as follows:</p>
<p>The Dominance of the War Situation</p>
<p>Let us first predict the dominance in the final decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union, that is, which side will make the first move. There are now two completely opposite views:</p>
<p>(1) Disregarding the significant losses of the winter counter-offensive, the Soviet Union will use its last strength to launch an offensive before the German army is fully prepared, to secure a favorable position and allow the long-delayed opening of the second front by Britain and the United States to be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet army is already on the verge of complete collapse, even before the German army begins its future decisive attack. The actual strength of the Soviet army has recently been extremely depleted. The divisions on the front lines are not only inadequately trained but also suffer from a shortage of personnel. Some divisions even have only 1,500 soldiers per division.</p>
<p>It is difficult to judge which of the above two opposing views is correct. At least both views tend to be extreme.</p>
<p>The Red Army's Current Strength</p>
<p>The conclusion of these two views both leads to the question of the truth about the Red Army's current strength. Let us now look at a more concrete view on this issue. The editorial of the Pravda newspaper on March 11 stated:</p>
<p>"The Soviet army does not need to have any apprehensive preparations for the expected German attacks. Do not forget that the Soviet Union has now deployed sufficient troops to prepare for a head-on blow."</p>
<p>This editorial in Pravda did not involve any specific figures. I will now introduce the views of well-informed sources who have observed the Red Army's strength concretely from a relatively general standpoint as follows:</p>
<p>"The Red Army has six million well-equipped soldiers on the Eastern Front and more than 500,000 in Siberia. In addition, the Red Army is also planning to retain one-third of its pre-war strength (said to be 175 divisions). Stalin spared this force from use during both the Battle of Moscow in 1941 and the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942, to prepare for the future of the war situation. From this point of view, there is almost no major difference in terms of troop strength compared to last spring. However, the deep-seated weaknesses lurking within the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. Last spring, the Soviet Union had one-third of its troop strength to spare, but now there is no surplus at all. If it is now necessary to expand the scope of conscription, it will weaken the minimum level of military production and agricultural labor, so it is impossible. Even if the Soviet Union's human resources are vast, they have already reached the point of saturation. If it suffers significant damage again this summer, it will be impossible to recover. Moreover, compared to last spring, the quality of the current soldiers has declined alarmingly. This is an ironclad fact. Since the beginning of the war, the Red Army has continuously used non-combatants, both young and old, male and female, from the battle zones directly in military affairs? Roughly speaking, the proportion of these non-combatants within the army has increased by more than 25% this summer compared to 1941. One-tenth of the Red Army's total strength must rely on the "combat power" of these "non-combatants." The decline in their quality is accelerating, and the kind of strength mentioned by Pravda is ultimately unreliable."</p>
<p>Crude American Products</p>
<p>A recently published London weekly, The Economist, stated:</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union's industrial productivity decreased by more than 40% compared to pre-war levels at the end of 1941. Due to the planned migration and concentration of factory equipment in the Volga, Ural, and Siberian regions, it had recovered to more than 80% of the 1939 level by the end of last year."</p>
<p>This is naturally a bit exaggerated. According to the official statement of the Soviet government:</p>
<p>"The production of aircraft and military supplies in the fourth quarter of 1942 broke pre-war records."</p>
<p>Whether the productivity of the Soviet Union's production centers in the Ural and Volga regions has been fully utilized is a major question. The loss of the abundant resources of Ukraine, such as iron and coal, and the reduction of accumulated raw materials, means that even if the Ural and Siberian regions desperately increase production, they will ultimately not be able to compensate for the losses, at least at the current stage. Let us examine the production status of the Ural and western Siberia. In 1942, the iron ore production in the Ural region was twice that of 1938, amounting to 14 million tons. Steel production increased by 40%. The coal production of Kuznetsk and Karaganda in 1942 was approximately 70 million tons. (The annual coal production of the Ruhr region in Germany reaches 200 million tons.) These figures indicate that the Soviet Union's production increase is indeed significant. This is naturally due to the large-scale development after the loss of western resources. Specifically speaking, the Soviet Union has focused on this area as the main production base for weapons and ammunition since the beginning of the war. For example, the weapon production in the Ural region in 1942 was stated to be three times that of pre-war levels. However, the increase in iron and other raw materials ultimately cannot keep up with this rapid increase in weapon production. Due to the decline in quality, or the failure to achieve certain goals, a deep imbalance has occurred within the production structure.</p>
<p>To alleviate this difficult situation, Britain, the United States, and especially the United States, have supplied the Soviet Union with 5,000 aircraft, 10,000 cannons, and other large quantities of weapons since the outbreak of the war. However, these American-made weapons are even cruder than those made by the Soviet Union itself, and their cold resistance is even worse. In fact, the Soviet army has not yet used them to this day, only creating the opposite phenomenon of wasting domestic transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's industrial power, judging from these fragmented reports, the Soviet Union has encountered major difficulties in military production. The crippled state of consumption and production constitutes a major loophole in the Soviet military.</p>
<p>Food Problem</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union lost the agricultural treasure trove of Ukraine, agriculture also encountered a major crisis. In order to avoid the occurrence of famine, the Moscow government has strived to expand farmland in eastern Russia, opening up 5 million acres in 1942. However, during this period, 30 million acres of farmland have been lost in the North Caucasus. During the winter offensive, the Soviet Union recovered part of the Donets Basin and the Kuban region, but the harvest in 1943 will still not be as good as a bumper year, because the crops in this area are mainly winter wheat and cannot be immediately changed to spring wheat. The British economic weekly The Economist also pointed out that the food problem is a major weakness of the Soviet Union at present. From March 1941 to the present, the United States has delivered 3 million tons of food to the Soviet Union in these two years, but the Soviet Union still considers it a drop in the bucket and of no help. Wartime food shortages are a common phenomenon throughout the world. How the Soviet Union will overcome the current predicament is a major problem.</p>
<p>German and Soviet Strategies</p>
<p>Given the many contradictions and weaknesses of the Soviet Union's wartime situation, what strategy will it adopt in the expected decisive battle? There have already been many observations on this. The view of neutral military intelligence is that the Soviet Union will still place its main defensive force in the Caucasus under the initiative of the German offensive, where it will have resolute resistance. At the same time, it will actively launch local offensives centered on the southern front or expand its offensives to the central front, attempting to disperse the German offensive forces in order to delay the war until winter and gain a favorable position. However, will Germany repeat the mistakes of 1941 and 1942 and allow the Red Army to follow its old tricks? If Hitler launches a major offensive this time, he must have already seen through the Red Army's General Winter tactics. Therefore, the outcome of the issue is how far the Red Army's field main force will be destroyed against a German major offensive that is several times larger than before. If the Soviet Union's military strength is truly as described above, then a full-scale crisis for the Soviet Union is inevitable. The only way to save the Soviet Union from this final crisis is for Britain and the United States to launch a second front in Europe. President Hitler's future major offensive against the Soviet Union, of course, takes the completion of the "Fortress Europe" to prevent the opening of the second front as an absolute prerequisite. It is believed that Germany must have a full grasp of this point before starting a major attack.</p>
<p>Latent Factors of Resistance</p>
<p>However, war, especially a major decisive battle like the one between Germany and the Soviet Union, cannot be fully understood in its final outcome by merely observing numbers and making superficial observations. There are still latent motives. The Soviet Union's stubborn resistance at the end of the three years is clear proof of this. The Soviet Union has:</p>
<p>(1) Latent industrial productivity;</p>
<p>(2) National will to fight in the defense war.</p>
<p>Neutral Soviet experts especially emphasize these material and spiritual motives. The current significant predicament of the Soviet military has lowered the level of exerting the power of mutual assistance in motive.</p>
<p>In this view, it is undeniable that the Soviet Union's military strength is facing a full-scale crisis this summer, at least. One of the keys to transforming world history can be seen in the future flames of war on the Eastern Front. (Xiang: Translated from the April 19th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Announces 34th Period Household Grain Allocation: One and a Half Sheng of White Rice or Brown Rice, Half Sheng of Broken Rice, Half Jin of Flour</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating: Rice and Flour Certificate No. 33 will be valid until the 29th of this month and will expire thereafter. From May 2nd to 9th, rice shops and the rice sales outlets of the Public Works Department will only sell rice and flour based on Rice and Flour Certificate No. 34. At that time, rice shops with registration numbers noted on the certificate will exchange each rice certificate for one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and half a sheng of broken rice at a price of six yuan. Furthermore, each flour certificate will be exchanged for half a jin of Grade 2 flour at a price of one yuan and two jiao. The rice shops and the rice sales outlets of the Public Works Department will cease sales on May 1st and 10th.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Warehouses and Godowns Completed; Second Step of Punitive Measures to be Implemented After Reviewing Reports</h3>
<p>The investigation of warehouses and godowns in this port, which began last week, has been completely completed as of yesterday. The authorities are currently carefully reviewing all reports in order to implement the second step of measures.</p>
<p>Unlawful Profiteering Will Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>It is learned that the second step in the authorities' investigation of warehouses is to punish or interrogate those suspected of hoarding. The authorities have investigated the quantity, items, sources, and various inside stories of the goods stored in warehouses by these individuals. Once the authorities have completed consultations, they will take severe measures and will not tolerate unlawful profiteering.</p>
<p>Evasion of Inspection Has Been Noted</p>
<p>Hereafter, legitimate merchants in this port must store goods in accordance with the warehouse regulations promulgated by the authorities a few days ago and must submit detailed reports of all details for the authorities to check at any time. Those who violate or fail to comply will be severely punished. The authorities have also paid close attention to those shops and companies that hoard goods in hidden places in an attempt to evade inspection.</p>
<p>Deadline for Reporting Warehouse Inventory</p>
<p>The Public Works Department previously issued Bulletin No. 6326 on the 16th of this month regarding the reporting of inventory by public warehouses, ordering all warehouses to submit detailed lists of all goods stored as of the 20th of this month to the Public Works Department Office No. 624 by the 30th of this month. It is learned that when submitting the lists, warehouse companies should also attach a list indicating the various goods that were moved in or out of each warehouse between March 15th and April 20th, as well as the dates of transfer.</p>
<h3>The System of Distributing Oil Based on Population Should Be Thoroughly Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Food Oil Trade Wholesale Association, which handles the procurement, transportation, and distribution of edible oil in this city, is now, in accordance with the directives of the military distribution organization, seeking to dredge the sources of edible oil from North China to supplement the shortage in the Central China region. In addition, for the sake of people's livelihood, the system of distributing oil based on population in this city will be thoroughly implemented. The edible oil panic in this city has lasted for many months without being resolved. Those in charge should make practical remedies. Empty talk is of no help. Now that the association intends to distribute oil based on population, it should be realized as soon as possible to meet the public's aspirations.</p>
<h3>Carrying More Than Two Dou of Rice is Not Allowed on Trams</h3>
<p>Since the lifting of the ban on transporting rice, the number of villagers who make a living by selling rice has increased daily. These people often enter the tram in groups after selling rice in the suburbs and carrying it into the concessions, in order to sell it in the central district of the concessions. However, as a result, the tram cars are often occupied by these people, and ordinary passengers are unable to board the tram. It is now heard that the relevant authorities issued a notice yesterday prohibiting those carrying more than two dou of rice from taking the tram to avoid the tram from being unable to meet demand. At the same time, it is also learned that those carrying other bulky items will also be prohibited from boarding the tram.</p>
<h3>330,000 People in the Urban Area Have Been Vaccinated Against Epidemics</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Health Bureau has been in charge of epidemic prevention in this city, it has been fully launched to universally vaccinate citizens. In previous years, all vaccination staff during the epidemic prevention period were handled by municipal treatment institutions, and medical staff were mostly part-time, which inevitably led to the regret of neglecting one thing or another. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau submitted a request to establish an epidemic prevention vaccination team before the start of epidemic prevention this year, in order to be meticulous and have a dedicated responsibility, and advertised to recruit more than 200 doctors and nurses. The entire city was divided into five general teams and 47 sub-teams, distributed throughout the urban area, to universally and freely vaccinate citizens. Since it started on April 16, in less than a week, the number of people vaccinated, according to reports from the general teams, totaled more than 260,000. Others, such as the Central Market, the Naval Academy, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the Municipal Security Office, took a total of 76,100 people, totaling 332,218 people.</p>
<h3>In Order to Eliminate Malpractices of Cigarette Merchants, Implement a New System of Supervised Door-to-Door Sales, Faithfully Implement Cigarette Price Limits, and Resolutely Investigate Hoarding and Refusal to Sell</h3>
<p>After the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association implemented unified cigarette allocation, the third batch of goods has already begun to be processed. The goods allocated are produced by the Military Management Gu Zhong Tobacco Company. All wholesalers and retailers have been allocated according to grades A, B, C, and D. The value of the goods allocated to Grade A is approximately 10,000 yuan, and the allocation is calculated sequentially. It is reported that wholesalers have paid the goods in full and completed the delivery of goods. Retailers will start picking up the goods from tomorrow. It is reported that in order to effectively implement the price limit and prevent various malpractices in the distribution of cigarettes, the association will implement a new system of supervised door-to-door cigarette sales: (1) Inspectors will be dispatched to supervise door-to-door sales for retailers who hold Grade A and B cards. (2) Retailers who hold Grade C and D cards will be inspected in rotation. Those who hoard and refuse to sell in an attempt to profit will be resolutely investigated according to law. Light offenders will be permanently suspended from allocation, and serious offenders will be ordered to suspend business.</p>
<h3>Watanabe Succeeds as Head of the Japanese Residents' Group</h3>
<p>The Japanese Residents' Group held a temporary people's meeting at the Japanese Club at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th to elect a successor to the former head of the people's group, Mr. Chiyozo Fukuda. As a result of the voting, Mr. Nobuo Watanabe was elected with a majority of 27 out of 32 votes and decided to take office as the fourth head of the people's group. Then, the entire meeting passed the annual salary of the head of the people's group and other proposals, and the meeting was adjourned at 4:27 p.m. Mr. Watanabe is 50 years old, a native of Tokyo Prefecture.

<h3>The Business Hours of Pawnshops in the Urban Area are Set to End at 7:00 PM Every Day</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau believes that there are many pawnshops in the urban area, and the bright lights at night attract business and hinder the appearance of the city. From today onwards, it is stipulated that business will cease at 7:00 PM every day. Yesterday, orders were issued to the Nanshi and Zhabei branches to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy Hirota Talks About British and American Diplomatic Conspiracies</h3>
<p>At a regular meeting with foreign journalists yesterday, Hiroichi Hirota, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, stated: We learned from the news from London yesterday morning that the Soviet Union has severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile. And recently the news that most of the staff and families of the US Embassy in Helsinki have gone to the capital of Sweden. The sinister diplomatic policy of the anti-Axis countries, which has been shielded by the Atlantic Charter and has sacrificed small European countries, has been fully exposed. Hirota said that the above news is enough to reflect the US government's policy of complying with Soviet demands to show appeasement. In this bad environment, Britain and the United States will inevitably comply with all the Soviet Union's demands in order to win it over to fight. The severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland also reflects the Soviet Union's determination to complete its ambition to seize land from small countries on the borders of Europe. Hirota continued, the Atlantic Charter is nothing more than bait used by the anti-Axis countries to lure weak European nations. However, the day when Britain and the United States agree to the Soviet Union's demands to achieve this goal may be the day when the countries that initiated the Atlantic Charter violate the sacredness of the Charter. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the Charter becomes waste paper. At the same time, the small European nations, who have always relied on the Charter, will realize the unreliability and hopelessness of the Charter at that time. In short, Britain and the United States are using the Charter to enrich themselves. Not to mention the small European countries, Chongqing and India will suffer the most cruel sacrifices. The truth is obvious, so there is no need for us to waste words.</p>
<h3>The Nanshi Baojia Office Reorganizes Various Neighborhood Lianbao</h3>

<h3>Police Parade - Postponed Again - May 5th at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>The grand parade of elite units from the Public Concession Police Headquarters, including all district police stations and auxiliary organizations under the Police Affairs Department, was originally scheduled to be held at the racecourse at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. However, due to rain that day, it was temporarily postponed to yesterday. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, with torrential rain the night before. Although yesterday was sunny, the racecourse ground remained extremely muddy, so the parade was reluctantly postponed again to 2:00 PM on May 5th at the original location.</p>
<h3>Surviving Calligraphy of Nie's Mother, Madame Zeng</h3>

<h3>Bicycles Must Have Receipts to Obtain Licenses - Avoid Private Sales and Purchases - To Avoid Unnecessary Trouble</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new bicycle registration regulations in the Public Concession, bicycle theft cases have been significantly reduced. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, the police are still allowing new bicycle owners to obtain licenses, but they must present a receipt from the bicycle shop and bring their bicycles to the police station for registration and stamping with a number. Bicycles found without licenses will be severely punished. The authorities also hope that residents will not privately sell or purchase bicycles, as resale often results in some people buying bicycles stolen by thieves and suffering innocently.</p>

<h3>The Science of Victory (3)</h3>
<p>The reason why the Japanese army and navy achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War was not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers, but also to the aircraft, tanks, artillery, and various excellent scientific weapons, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, and so on, supplied to the battlefield. The army awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal to the inventors of these victorious weapons. Here, we introduce the recipients of the awards and the main inventors: (Tao: Translated from the April 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Regarding the design of military rations: Army engineers Koyama Eiji, Hashimoto Fuichi, Suzuki Takeo, and collaborators:</p>
<p>A hungry person cannot fight, so the important relationship between war and food cannot be ignored. At the same time, Japan's operational guidelines are not passive defense, but active offense and advance. Far from the supply lines, on isolated islands in the ocean, and in sparsely populated high mountains and ridges, the Imperial Army relies solely on portable rations to sustain itself for many days. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and massively produce portable, highly nutritious, and delicious powdered pastes and powdered soy sauces, so as to solve and guarantee the "food" problem for the army. Food is also a weapon.</p>
<p>The engineers Koyama, Hashimoto, and Suzuki of the Foodstuffs General Factory collaborated and received assistance from others to invent poison water detectors, powdered soy sauce manufacturing equipment, battlefield soy sauce making methods, and rapid soy sauce making methods using damaged rice. They completed the design of the necessary military rations specific to the Japanese. Currently, these methods are actively used in both inland supply factories and battlefield supply factories, making a great contribution to improving combat effectiveness. The Japanese military soy sauce used as soy sauce "essence" after the Sino-Japanese War was not suitable for long-term storage or mass production, so the three engineers bought some German goods in 1930, and after continuous research and improvement, finally invented an excellent grain-based device. At that time, soy sauce brewing still required extensive equipment and sufficient time, and the manufacturing method was very complicated, making it unsuitable for use on the battlefield. However, future wars must be self-sufficient on the spot. After painstaking efforts to utilize local materials and simple manufacturing methods, they finally succeeded after tireless research. When they cheered for success, they actually produced soy sauce-like medicine oil. After much effort, they overcame all difficulties and completed a clever wartime manufacturing method using battlefield cooking utensils and local materials. This solved the difficult problem of self-sufficiency of food in the Greater East Asia War era. Recently, in Myanmar, using this method, they made soy sauce in less than seventeen days that was even better than the soy sauce sold on the domestic market. The soldiers did not know that it was locally produced, and worked hard to eat more in preparation for tomorrow's war. At the same time, the water absolutely necessary for on-site brewing also needed to be checked, so a poison water detector was invented. This made a great contribution to on-site self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>Sports - Volleyball League Opens - Soviet Team Wins Against White Team - Women's Team Blue Wins Against West Qinghong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Volleyball League, jointly organized by the City Sports Association and the Chinese YMCA, opened last night at the Chinese YMCA Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. Over a thousand people watched. In the first game, Class B1, the Russian Team Kekong, in the second game, Class B2, the Public Security Team defeated the Olympic Team. Next, the women's team took the stage, with the Blue Team facing West Qinghong. In the first set, West Qinghong won 21 to 13. The Blue Team rallied in the second set, winning 21 to 18. In the final set, the Blue Team won again 21 to 13. Overall, the Blue Team defeated West Qinghong two to one. The final match was between the White Team and the Soviet Team, which was very tense. In the first set, the White Team won 21 to 18. Unexpectedly, the Soviet team suddenly became active and won the next two sets 21 to 17 and 21 to 15, turning defeat into victory. As a result, the Soviet team won two to one against the White team.</p>

<h3>Economic World - Commentary - The Key to Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>Setting official prices for goods is certainly an important task in stabilizing prices. However, it must be based on scientific methods, be fair and impartial, to gain cooperation from all parties and achieve satisfactory results. Otherwise, official prices are official prices, and the black market is the black market, often in name only, leading to a rampant black market situation. The worst phenomenon in Shanghai today is that items subject to price controls are often difficult to buy. Stores clearly have these items but refuse to sell them, claiming they are out of stock. It can be said that the stricter the price controls, the scarcer the items become. This not only affects the lives of citizens, causing consumers great pain, but also creates great difficulties for producers, which does not seem to be a way to encourage hard work in production. Therefore, many manufacturers in Shanghai claim that they cannot start work due to a shortage of raw materials, but there are also some cunning manufacturers who clearly have raw materials but are unwilling to start work. Because after the price of raw materials has skyrocketed, even if they start work, it is not as profitable as stockpiling or selling raw materials, so why should factory operators seek trouble for themselves? Therefore, in the future, if the authorities set price controls on goods, they should base them on the factory's cost accounting and all expenses. They should not raise them excessively, nor should they lower them excessively. This is the key to stabilizing prices, and it seems worthy of the authorities' research and discussion.</p>
<h3>Fully Promote Financial Exchange in the Co-Prosperity Sphere - Vice President of the Bank of Japan Arrives in Shanghai - Speaks to Japanese Reporters Afterwards</h3>
<p>Mr. Shibusawa Keizo, Vice President of the Bank of Japan, recently arrived in Shanghai by plane from Japan to inspect the economic situation in China after the National Government joined the war. At 5:30 PM on the 26th, he met with Japanese reporters and gave a speech. He will stay in China for one month and is scheduled to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month, and then return to Japan via Bengbu, Beijing, and Tianjin. The following is his speech:</p>
<p>This is my first time inspecting China. The purpose of my visit is to examine the actual situation in Central and Northern China and exchange opinions with those in charge of Sino-Japanese relations. Japan has great expectations for China. As for the economic aspect, the Bank of Japan is willing to make its best efforts to assist the development of the Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>Economic cooperation between China and Japan has also made significant progress in terms of capital. For example, the loan issue with the Yokohama Specie Bank is proof of capital cooperation. In the future, the exchange of goods within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expected to be promoted. At the same time, there is also the issue of foreign exchange. We should promote the financial exchange policy of the Co-Prosperity Sphere with a new ideal.</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank have extremely important tasks. Japan's wartime economic system is gradually being prepared, and the production increase and development plans for the five major core industries are progressing in the same way as the concentrated use of funds. All departments have achieved better-than-expected results. (April 27th, Continental New News)</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Criminal Special High Division Conducts Industry Surveys - And Convenes Rotating Discussion Meetings</h3>
<p>Okazaki, the director of the Criminal Special High Division of the Lao Zha District Police Station in the Public Concession, is conducting basic surveys, convening discussion meetings with the heads of various shops, explaining the meaning of the basic surveys, and giving the police officers the opportunity to get to know the heads of the shops in order to build relationships with various businesses in the concession and investigate the situation of various industries. Yesterday (the 27th) was the fifth meeting, held at 9:30 AM at the Great Shanghai Theater. Director Okazaki, Deputy Director Komura, Chinese Inspector Liu Xiangzhai, and representatives from various industries, including the printing industry, lithography industry, soda and beer industry, photography industry, bookstore industry, gift industry, mahjong industry, newspaper industry, engraving industry, dried longan industry, tea industry, magazine industry, southern loan industry, and pickle industry, attended, totaling several hundred people. First, Liu Xiangzhai introduced everyone to each other, and then Director Okazaki reported on the meaning of conducting basic surveys, which is to strengthen the relationship between the police and the people, help each other, maintain local peace, and ensure social order. Then, Lu Weida reported on three points of the basic survey method. Other industries will continue to be convened in rotation today (the 28th) at the Great Shanghai Theater, starting at 9:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai District Income Tax - Collection Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance adjusted the various types of income tax within the scope of the urban area, the collection has been very smooth. The first type of business profit income tax and the third type of various interest income tax for last year (1942) started on the first of last month. Up to recently, it has been reported that those who have declared and paid taxes have reached more than 8.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the bureau has recently begun collecting the second type of salary and remuneration income tax. All self-employed persons and others engaged in various industries with offices should declare their salary and remuneration income for the previous year (1942) in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations. It is reported that the bureau has issued notices, setting a deadline for declaration, in order to assess the tax amount.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for the Fourth Quarter Has Arrived - Banks Handle Credit Loans</h3>
<p>In order to carefully handle credit loans for the fourth quarter and avoid fueling speculation and hoarding, the banks of the silver industry decided to handle them in accordance with the new methods for restricting loans passed by the two industry associations. Although there are no accurate statistics on long-term credit loans due in the fourth quarter, it is estimated that they amount to at least 50 million yuan. Those that do not comply with the laws and new methods for restricting loans will be notified to be recovered before the end of the fourth quarter. However, old accounts with reputable companies and firms will be allowed to process loans. In the future, new loans will be limited to companies and firms in various industries engaged in production, and must have a reliable guarantor and a loan agreement to ensure that the principal and interest are fully repaid upon maturity. Because the deadline for the fourth quarter has arrived, various industries and banks are very busy negotiating credit loans. Because the banks are particularly strict about the use of the loans applied for and are implementing austerity measures, the number of new loans completed is small. The longest term for new soft loans in this period is six months, due at the end of October. Although the overall financial situation in the fourth quarter remains stable, the silver market is particularly tight due to the fourth-quarter tightening of loans.</p>
<h3>Communications Bank and Others Plan - To Provide Rural Loans</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the government to promote the implementation of the agricultural production increase plan, the Communications Bank and others have decided to organize a "Rural Loan Banking Group" with the Communications Bank as the core to provide low-interest rural loans. These loans are limited to farmers borrowing for the purchase of agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and other purposes. The Communications Bank's survey of rural economy has come to an end, and it is expected to begin disbursing loans at the beginning of next month (May). The bank is working with cooperatives in various cleanup areas during the disbursement of loans, and detailed plans are being drafted.</p>
<h3>Reader Forum - The New Stage of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce and Its Current Priorities</h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>The establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce has undoubtedly been aimed at assisting the National Government in implementing wartime economic policies. With the close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, the goal is to first make the exchange of materials more smooth, in order to control prices, increase production, and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current stage is said to be a new stage of industry and commerce for the enemy. This stage is characterized by the establishment of the National Government's wartime economic policies after it joined the war, and the implementation of autonomous commercial controls.</p>
<p>In this new stage, Shanghai's industry and commerce are facing an urgent and important mission, which is the mission of "absorbing idle capital and engaging in increased production."</p>
<p>The soaring prices have already caused ordinary people to suffer from unbearable burdens. The current situation of "everything is rising, and every market is black" has made it impossible for people to live, and has further caused people to lose trust in the national currency, which is a major obstacle and impediment to the National Government's implementation of wartime economic policies. Therefore, actively and decisively suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods is the most basic and paramount task at present. As for the methods, they are nothing more than "stabilizing currency value," "increasing production," and "suppressing hoarding." Since the Japanese government has repeatedly stated its determination not to change the ratio between military tickets and reserve notes, and the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement, it shows that everything has already been objectively equipped with excellent conditions, and the main problem lies in subjective efforts.</p>
<p>There are currently two subjective drawbacks that must be corrected: first, there is an excess of purchasing power on the part of a part of the population, and a lack of purchasing power on the part of a part of the population. This part of the excess purchasing power is being used to hoard industrial raw materials and industrial products, causing prices to rise without principle. Second, the recession in Shanghai's industrial sector and the extreme contraction of production have caused the supply of industrial products to fall short of demand, which is an important factor in the soaring prices. The reason for this is nothing more than the narrow views, short-sighted perspectives, and opportunistic psychology of most industrialists and businessmen.</p>
<p>Therefore, now that the General Chamber of Commerce has been established, all industrial, commercial, and financial circles in Shanghai must eliminate the contradictions of interest between them and turn into harmonious and mutually beneficial cooperation. They must thoroughly correct and eliminate the narrow views, short-sighted perspectives, and opportunistic psychology of the past, and further use all remaining funds to engage in industrial and agricultural production and reproduction. For example, the recently implemented new measures to restrict and tighten loans, acceptance of drafts, and discounting of bills are all relatively passive measures, but they are still a new measure to prevent the use of funds to fuel speculation and hoarding. If the primary task of this new stage is to be completed, so that China's economy can move towards recovery and people's livelihoods can move towards stability, it still depends on the efforts of Shanghai's industrial, commercial, and financial circles.

<h3>Li Quanshi Discusses - Eliminating the Wind of Speculation and Hoarding - Adopting Both Stopgap and Fundamental Measures - Determined to Thoroughly Investigate and Eradicate Hoarding, Tighten Currency, and Increase Production</h3>
<p>The National Government authorities previously noted that prices in Shanghai were soaring endlessly, greatly affecting people's livelihoods. Therefore, in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, they specially sent Chen Zhishuo, Director of the Department of Finance, and Yuan Yuquan, Vice Minister of the Department of Industry, to Shanghai to meet with Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Chen Yunwen, Superintendent of the Commercial Regulation Committee, to investigate profiteering and hoarding merchants and severely punish them. Currently, the investigation of the amount of loans borrowed by customers of silver firms, their payment situation, and the stockpiling of goods in various warehouses is still ongoing. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li Quanshi of the China Economic Research Association, who gave the following opinions on eliminating speculation and hoarding:</p>
<p>Determined to Thoroughly Investigate Big Hoarders</p>
<p>Rising prices are an inevitable fact in wartime, and this state of affairs is common to wartime; however, the rapid rise is due to the asset class who have been hoarding goods in cycles, causing the supply of goods on the market to fall short of demand. The goods needed by the people have been collected and controlled by hoarders, and those in need have no choice but to buy them at high prices, thus increasing the burden of life. This is not a concern for capitalists, but it is unbearable for ordinary wage earners. Currently, not only those with huge amounts of capital are rising up to do this, but also those with a little savings in their hands are competing to buy goods. Observing this situation, the trend of rising prices will become more and more turbulent. Therefore, if we want to eliminate speculation and hoarding and suppress prices, we should adopt both stopgap and fundamental measures and work in a practical way. (1) For fundamental measures, we must be determined to thoroughly investigate hoarding merchants, so that every hoarder of goods, whether a big hoarder or a small hoarder, must be dealt with in accordance with the law, and ordered to release the goods at a fair price, to eliminate any suspicion of favoritism. We hope that the work of thoroughly investigating hoarders will continue to be carried out in the future, and we must make the greatest determination to eradicate the trend of hoarding.</p>
<p>Tighten Currency and Increase Production</p>
<p>(2) Stopgap measures are to tighten currency and increase production. Because the current trend of hoarding is that there is too much money and a lack of sources of goods. Therefore, in order to help eliminate the grand effect of speculation and hoarding, we should tighten currency, so that silver firms cannot use excessive idle funds for the purpose of hoarding goods, in order to reduce the hoarders' capital. On the one hand, the government financial institutions should guide idle funds into rural areas, handle agricultural loans, regulate the rural economy, and work hard to increase production. In rural areas, we should increase the output of rice, wheat, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. In cities and towns, we should make it easier for factories to purchase and transport raw materials, in order to increase the output of industrial products, so that the use of wartime materials is abundant and both military and civilian needs are met with a sense of balanced supply. If the above two types of stopgap and fundamental measures can be realized, then the trend of hoarding can be eliminated, and prices can also be suppressed for a long time.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Currency Problem (II)</h3>
<p>— By Tadao Imamura</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>People generally believe that China's economy is a unique entity and extremely complex. This is due to the aforementioned differing preconditions. In reality, the trend is quite simple. This is because the Chinese people's concept of economic conditions is simple, and the Chinese people's thoughts and actions are simple. Most Japanese or Chinese, especially those with knowledge, consider delving into principles as creating unnecessary trouble. In fact, it's common for an economic undertaking to be attributed to multiple causes. However, the thought of "creating unnecessary trouble" dampens the enthusiasm for research, and the fundamental cause remains unclear. To examine China's economic undertakings, one must first analyze the differences in all preconditions, then study the simple economic laws. This makes it easier to understand. Based on these simple laws, devising policies becomes easy.</p>
<p>For example, regarding rising prices, Chinese people attribute price increases due to material factors to "price increases," and price increases due to currency factors to "currency devaluation." From the perspective of the result, price increases are equivalent to currency devaluation. However, when price increases originate from material factors, Chinese people say, "It's a price increase, not a currency devaluation." They differentiate between currency devaluation and price increases, adopting a so-called causal theory, believing that the external value of the currency has not decreased, and the credit of the currency is good. Therefore, the current price increases are not due to currency factors and cannot be considered currency devaluation. Today's price increases are due to a decrease in imports from overseas and the lack of recovery in production industries, leading to a gradual shortage of materials and rising prices. Therefore, this is a "price increase." This kind of view is very simplistic.</p>
<p>Regarding rising prices in inland cities, according to the opinions of inland residents, they often use the following simple view, believing: "This is caused by rising prices in Shanghai. If prices in Shanghai fall, prices in inland areas will also fall." Regarding the prices of local products, farmers answer: "The things we buy have become expensive, so the things we sell have also become expensive. The increase in the price of local products is for this reason, there is no other reason." This shows that farmers' views have not yet escaped the realm of barter economy. For example, if selling 100 yuan worth of production materials can obtain 100 yuan in return, and can buy 100 yuan worth of living materials, then even if prices rise, farmers will maintain this ratio. If 100 yuan worth of production materials cannot be exchanged for 100 yuan worth of living materials, they will raise the price of production materials. This clearly shows how simple the actions of the Chinese people are. For example, the explanation for shortages is that the amount of currency is not balanced with the quantity of materials. As long as the amount of currency is reduced, prices will fall. However, based on the simple idea of "materials are scarce and prices rise," only policies targeting materials will be effective immediately. Policies regarding currency will not easily lower prices.</p>
<p>In short, when observing China's economic situation or attempting to implement policies, it is necessary to analyze the differences in preconditions and clearly recognize them. Otherwise, it will be futile and ineffective. (Yun: Translated from the Mainland News of April 26th)</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Undertaking Business: Practical Work, Hard Work, Arduous Work</h3>
<p>— By Naiwen Jia</p>
<p>People often want to choose easy and profitable things to do, while neglecting complex and difficult ones, leaving them for others. Sometimes, they think that very easy things are not worth doing, and they are unwilling to do them. As a result, they become empty and superficial, wandering on divergent paths, never able to move forward, becoming the laggards of the times. There are countless people like this in the world!</p>
<p>To eliminate this common human ailment, one must first have the spirit of practical work, hard work, and arduous work.</p>
<p>These three types of work are the three movements of a business, none of which can be missing. Practical work refers to doing a meaningful thing in a solid and down-to-earth manner. The opposite is empty work. When there is a meaningful and practical thing, it needs to be done bravely and diligently. Even if there are small failures, they are ignored, and the work continues with a plan, without wavering from the original intention. This is hard work. The opposite is blind work. Having practical work and hard work still requires arduous work, otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Arduous work is the conclusion of a business, and it can also be said to be the final determining point for the success or failure of a business, because when the success or failure of a business has not reached a clear point, it often goes through a process of hardship and danger. If you work hard and struggle through hardships and dangers, grit your teeth, persevere, and bury yourself in hard work, then you are a successful entrepreneur. Otherwise, you are a failure.</p>
<p>Whether you are a smart, foolish, unwise or not-so-foolish person, as long as you do not give up on yourself and embrace the spirit of practical work, hard work, and arduous work, then you can achieve true success in any large or small undertaking. People like this not only create a brilliant and bright future for themselves, but also become the cutting edge of the times, the driving force for the advancement of all undertakings in the world. Especially in these turbulent times, our motherland is demanding people with practical work, hard work, and arduous work to take on the great mission of building a new China.</p>
<h3>Enthusiasm and Life</h3>
<p>— By Luo Chaifu</p>
<p>The biggest reason for many people's unhappiness is that they lack "enthusiasm." They lack the spirit of "enthusiasm" to observe and appreciate the world outside themselves, and instead focus their attention on their own internal world, or they think they are standing in a noble position, treating everyone in the world as crude and shallow people, laughing sarcastically when they are happy, and cursing when they are unhappy. This kind of self-proclaimed clever person is no different from depriving himself of happiness and heading down the road of self-inflicted trouble.</p>
<p>Life is indeed short and not enough to be enthusiastic about everything, but the interests we need to cultivate must fill our entire lives, and we must seek materials outside ourselves to transform interest into experience. The more experience, the more we enjoy life's happiness. Therefore, having enthusiasm for external things can directly control life's happiness.</p>
<p>For example, two people take the tram. One person just sits there bored, waits until they reach their destination, and then gets off. Boredom does not bring him happiness during these few tens of minutes. The other person is different. He uses this opportunity to observe every passenger, analyze their character, and guess their personality. Perhaps he will discover interesting things, but at least those few tens of minutes have passed in activity due to "enthusiasm."</p>
<p>A person who has enthusiasm for friends and career is always a welcome person, because what friends need is genuine "sympathy," and what career needs is also enthusiasm with proactiveness and confidence. Otherwise, a person without sympathy will not have friends, and a person who does not actively and earnestly develop a strong interest in career will not achieve success.</p>
<p>I hope that when everyone comes into this world, they are like a lively cat walking into a strange house, with the surrounding environment seeming to be full of amazing things, full of enthusiasm to pursue broad knowledge, enrich our lives, and pursue the happiness that life should have.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk</h3>
<p>— By Lü Xin</p>
<p>People all like success and dislike failure. However, they do not know that without failure, how can there be success in the world? Moreover, if a thing has not gone through failure and difficulty (that is, has not gone through struggle), may I ask if it can become a great thing? Will there be the joy of success afterward? Therefore, I hope that people in the world will look for more failures, so that in the future, when this thing is successful, there will be more joy.</p>
<p>People also like to get a bargain and dislike taking a loss. However, they do not know that without taking a loss, how can there be a bargain? What if oneself gets a bargain and others take a loss? Therefore, I also hope that people will look for fewer bargains, which means taking fewer losses.</p>
<p>Everyone also likes to have a dreamlike paradise, often sighing that the environment is not good. However, they do not know that without bad, how can there be excellent performance? For example, now that we are living such a difficult life, you can better imagine the loveliness of a world of singing and dancing, which will increase your courage to fight for it. If a person's life is lived in a world of singing and dancing, what a common life it would be! Because you simply do not know the loveliness of singing and dancing, and take it for granted. Therefore, life also becomes like a pig's laziness. "The times make heroes, and heroes make the times." This is indeed a profound saying.</p>
<p>People also harbor a selfish heart, hoping that others will help me, and disliking me helping others, saying: "I will not pluck a hair to benefit the world." They only want to watch others fall, and are unwilling to take one more step on a rugged road to help.</p>
<p>People also harbor a heart of dissatisfaction. When they have rice to eat, they want vegetables to eat. When they have vegetables to eat, they want meat to eat. However, they do not know the desire they had when they had nothing to eat. Harboring only the desire to get more after getting something, they will never be satisfied.</p>
<p>People also like to raise birds and fish, thinking it is a refined thing, but they do not know how sad it would be if they themselves were locked in a narrow cage to be appreciated by other animals.</p>
<h3>The Times and Heroes</h3>
<p>— By Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>"The times make heroes," and "heroes make the times," these are two old sayings. In the end, are the times created by heroes, or do the times produce heroes? I think the two have a close relationship. In other words, heroes can make the times, and the times can also make heroes.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about "the times make heroes." Heroes are the product of the times and are discovered from the real world, not descended from heaven. Therefore, when the times are surging and turbulent, and war is raging, heroes are selected from the ranks of the people.</p>
<p>From the above theory, it is undoubtedly certain that heroes are the product of the times. In past history, it is also easy to find.</p>
<p>We know that Qin Shihuang was a hero (many books say he was not, but let's not worry about that here). He unified the six kingdoms. This was because the economic foundation at the time had changed, and commercial capital had reached a considerable level of development, creating a necessary situation for unification, not just relying on Shihuang's power.</p>
<p>This is to say, "the times make heroes." But one-sided truth is not complete. Otherwise, heroes would be subject to the domination of history, without the ability to interfere with history in the slightest. Therefore, we will further explain the reasons for "heroes making the times."</p>
<p>We know that heroes are selected from the ranks of the people. Therefore, their psychology, wisdom, and vision are all one level higher than ordinary people. Especially their ability to analyze and synthesize is even more needed. Therefore, the development of society and the progress of the times all rely on the promotion of heroes. This is to say, "heroes make the times."</p>
<p>Heroes are admired. Do they not have the desire to be heroes themselves?</p>
<p>Friends, let me tell you: recognize the times, grasp the social trends, and even if you are oppressed by the times and the environment, do not be afraid of them, but create the times and conquer the environment. This is the true "hero of the times."</p>
<h3>Three Scenes of Selling Tickets on the Tram</h3>
<p>— By Zhong Hui</p>
<p>Scene One</p>
<p>As the tram approaches the station, the crowd swarms forward. Children shout, adults yell, as if they are escaping for their lives, afraid of getting separated. Regardless of who they are, regardless of their status or morality, they push and shove each other, following the crowd onto the tram. Inside the tram, besides the people squeezed next to you, and the vegetables and rice sacks at your feet, there is only the awkward face of the ticket seller.</p>
<p>"Tickets, tickets, hey! Get your coins out!" the ticket seller shouts, demanding money from the passengers as if he is collecting debts.</p>
<p>One passenger pays him thirty cents, "Tongfu Road." The ticket seller takes the money, gives him a twenty-cent ticket, and says with a smile, "Sorry!" The passenger looks at the ticket and says nothing. Another young man in a suit shouts, "Hey! Ticket seller! How much is this ticket worth?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, sorry!" the ticket seller says with a forced smile.</p>
<p>"That's not okay. If one is missing, does your company have rules?"</p>
<p>The ticket seller's smile immediately disappears, and he curses in a low Yangzhou accent: "Damn his mother!" He exchanges the ticket for another one. Then he yells at others, "Tickets, those taking the tram must buy tickets, hurry up and get them out!" He squeezes in front of a group of women and children carrying rice sacks. He collects money from them one by one, but doesn't give them tickets.</p>
<p>"Hey! You didn't give me a ticket!"</p>
<p>The ticket seller says fiercely, "You take the tram all day long, don't you know the rules! Wait a minute, got it!" The group of poor friends rolls their eyes at him!</p>
<p>Scene Two</p>
<p>A long-gowned passenger near the tram door says, "Ticket seller! I need my change, I'm getting off."</p>
<p>The ticket seller says in surprise, "What? How much money did you pay?"</p>
<p>"Huh! Strange! I gave you a ten-dollar bill to buy a thirty-cent ticket." He waves the ticket.</p>
<p>"No passenger on this tram gave me a ten-dollar bill!" the ticket seller says.</p>
<p>"How unreasonable! Not giving me my change, is this your company's rule!"</p>
<p>The two argue, no one opens the tram door, and the passenger who wants to get off yells. As a result, a ticket inspector runs up.</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw this gentleman pay with a ten-dollar bill," one passenger says.</p>
<p>"I saw it too!" another passenger nearby says.</p>
<p>"This passenger paid as soon as he got on," a friend in a suit says.</p>
<p>The ticket seller's face turns red, "It's really strange!" Now that there are so many witnesses, it's hard to argue. The ticket seller has no choice but to obediently give the gentleman nine dollars and seventy cents. The passenger takes the money and gets off the tram, still grumbling under his breath. After one stop, these witnesses all get off the tram one after another.</p>
<p>Scene Three</p>
<p>The tram starts from Jing'an Temple. The people on the tram are so crowded that they can hardly breathe. This time, the ticket seller doesn't curse or yell as he desperately closes the tram door. He only says, "Those who are coming in, squeeze to the inside, squeeze tighter!" People keep squeezing in, and the small tram has already become overly full. In the end, the ticket inspector under the tram forces the tram door shut. The ticket seller squeezes back and forth through the crowd, collecting money from each person. When he sees women and children carrying rice, he doesn't say a word. When he sees some difficult people, he says, "Sorry, thank you!" As a result, no one on the tram has a ticket.</p>
<p>"Hey! You took the money, where are the tickets?"</p>
<p>"Huh! It's like collecting rent!"</p>
<p>Everyone says loudly like this, but the ticket seller pretends not to hear and keeps telling jokes: "Squeezing like this, I can save on dinner!" or "Squeezing like this! It would be better to build a loft in the tram tomorrow!"</p>
<p>When the tram arrives, the passengers swarm out like water. Unexpectedly, a Japanese gentleman in civilian clothes is standing in front of the tram, asking each passenger for their ticket. The first one doesn't have a ticket, the second one doesn't have a ticket, the third one still doesn't have a ticket... The passengers panic, and the ticket seller's face also changes. The Japanese ticket inspector immediately drags the ticket seller to the ticket office. At first, the passengers are shocked, and then they burst out laughing. It's as if everyone has just acted in a play, and now it's over.</p>
<h3>Collected Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— By Helen</p>
<p>Theory and fact are completely two different things. If you only have theory but don't do it in a down-to-earth manner, then theory will never become a fact. It is equal to a check that cannot be cashed, so we must cultivate the habit of "doing what we say."</p>
<p>Diligence and thrift are the helm of life, and they can lead us into the realm of happiness. Although there may be some pain at the beginning, it gives us permanent peace and happiness. What about laziness? On the contrary, it gives us temporary happiness and leisure, but it leads us to the realm of destruction, suffering eternal pain. Social Service</p>
<h3>Reducing Women's Consumption: We Should Learn to Sew Ourselves</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Heng</p>
<p>These days, there are so many Gu Lüzhuang and clothing companies in Shanghai, and Chinese and Western garment shops are everywhere. Their decoration and living expenses are mostly provided by us women. Their consumption is quite considerable based on the yearly statistics. If we all did it ourselves, embroidered ourselves, sewed ourselves, and knitted ourselves, wouldn't it reduce a lot of consumption for individuals and families!</p>
<p>One day, I was introduced by a friend and taken to the Chinese Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Center for a visit. As soon as I walked in, I could hear the sound of machines clattering, and I saw the sisters working hard. In a large room, there were more than a dozen new white sewing machines, occupied by more than a dozen young ladies. Under the careful calculations of the ladies, pieces of leather and yardsticks were cut into fashionable new clothes. Various colors of satin were constantly being pushed on the machines, and the beautiful and delicate patterns were completed by the skillful hands of the sisters. There was also an instructor constantly pointing out, teaching cutting, teaching sewing, and teaching embroidery in the group of sisters. I saw that their faces were all filled with happy emotions.</p>
<p>According to that friend, the director of the training center, Mr. Tang Aimei, saw that most of the wives who depended on their husbands even had to take small tears or shortening of clothes to the tailor, which was really too much to bear, so he advocated setting up a machine embroidery training center, so that women would have the opportunity to learn a skill. It can reduce the consumption of the family economy, and it can increase the production of individuals and society.</p>
<p>The first batch of recruits she recruited were mostly women in distress and abandoned wives. Under the painstaking voluntary teaching of Principal Tang, after more than six months of practice, they were able to produce things. Principal Tang then went one by one to find a way out for them and seek introductions. To this day, countless producers have been created by her hands and are serving everywhere.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese Sewing and Embroidery Training Center is to cultivate women's applied skills, meet social needs, and promote women's production undertakings, regardless of age. Anyone who is interested in learning can register. The center specializes in teaching cutting, machinery, sewing machines, embroidery, etc. Classes are held daily (except Sundays) from 8:30 am to 11:30 am and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. There is no limit to the curriculum, and it is tentatively divided into elementary and advanced levels, each lasting three months. The tuition fee is 120 yuan per term. The clothes made during the term can be taken home freely by the students. The address is No. 168 at the intersection of Guling Road and Parker Road.</p>
<h3>Promoting Small Hand-Operated Textile Machines</h3>
<p>China has only used machines for weaving for fifty or sixty years. Before using machine weaving, it was hand spinning and hand weaving. This hand spinning and weaving has solved the problem of people's clothing for thousands of years. Currently, because cloth prices are expensive, hand spinning and hand weaving are popular again in rural areas.</p>
<p>Hand spinning has a history of thousands of years, but it adheres to the old methods and rarely improves. One person only spins one thread. Four years ago, the Chinese only had improved hand spinning machines appear. The earliest was Mr. Mu Ouchu's spinning machine. This spinning machine is foot-operated and has a relatively complex structure, but it can already spin more than ten threads. Since then, many people have made improvements. These improved hand spinning machines have been widely used in the interior. However, they are still rarely used in the Jianghuai area. The reason for this is, first, few people promote it: second, there is a lack of technical personnel to make reasonable improvements to the structure. Recently, some people in Shanghai have also manufactured simple hand spinning machines for sale. Although this hand spinning machine can spin flowers into yarn, there is still room for improvement in the actual application in rural areas and the structure. My friend Mr. Ma has a great interest in this kind of spinning machine and has been studying it carefully. He has created a hand spinning machine that is suitable for rural areas: in order to promote the widespread application of hand spinning machines, Mr. Ma is very willing to jointly study with those interested in hand spinning. If you are interested in purchasing one, you can also design it for you. Contact address: Mr. Ma, No. 491 Maitang Road. Every day after 7 pm or on Sundays. (Qu Zunyi)</p>
