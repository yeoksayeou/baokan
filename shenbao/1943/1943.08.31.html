<p>社評</p>
<h3>增加生產須迎頭趕上</h3>
<p>近來談中國經濟問題者，莫不以糧食物價與增加生產諸問題為討論之中心，糧食問題，原物價與增產問題中之一部分，所以，從廣義的說，目前中國經濟問題之中心，只是物價與增加生產兩項，而這兩問題又是一物的兩面，因為增加生產是調整物價的主要因素，要澈底解決物價問題，非積極的從事增加生產不可。關於這種顯明的經濟原理，已經為大家所瞭解，同時，政府也早經在整個經濟政策綱領中確定了。論理，「增加生產」既經政府定為國策，人民一致瞭解，就應該很順利的實現。但是，我們試加檢討，還是農業方面已經推進增加生產計劃呢？還是工業方面已經推進增加生產計劃呢？還是計劃自計劃，事實自事實呢？我們僅就上海工業界的生產現狀以觀，莫說增加生產，就是維持原有產量尙成問題，實在不能不令人無限的抱憾！</p>
<p>昨天報載汪主席視察鎮江區消鄉後，解答新聞記者提出的問題時說：上海舊租界與內地向來有一個很大的懸隔，產米的是清鄉地區，食米的是上海五百萬市民；械棉的是清鄉地區農民，而紡紗織布的是上海工廠。紗布有了黑市，種棉的農人辛辛苦苦種了棉花，無力買布。種稻的農民，辛辛苦苦收了榖米，換了錢也無力買布。這都可證明上海舊租界和內地的分隔。今租界旣已接收，政府當積極推行統一的經濟政策，淸鄉地區有的是農業，上海有的是輕工業，自當通盤計劃，發展淸鄉地區的農業，配合上海輕工業的發展。農業是淸鄉地區要努力的，工業是上海要努力的。深信租界接收之後，統一的經濟政策，必能順利推行。</p>
<p>我們仔細考察汪主席所揭示的，無非期待工業農業的生產者，各就本位努力生產，使鄉村農業與都市工業生產發生聯擊，以實現統一的經濟政策。對於這一主張，我們相信上海的工業生產界很能贊同的，更可以說求之不得的。因為工業界原是以盡量生產或停止生產的現象，並不是工業界本身願意如此，而是受了環境的限制不得不如此的。我們竭誠希望政府在倡言增加生產，責望上海努力工業生產之際，同時，必須嚴切重視所以阻碍生產的原因所在，運用政治力量，為這理解除。如果不先澈底解除阻碍生產的原因，那末，「增加生產」一辭，終將成為口頭禪了。</p>
<p>我們更返顧友邦日本對於增加生產的重視，隨時隨地毫不放鬆，在增產上所最需要的資材，設備，勞力各方面，均經加以最大限度的活用運營，因而必獲良好的成績。可是，他們以為各工廠各就木身單位雖已發揮全部能力，但從綜合性質的全體關係看來，尙未發揮全部能力，，政府更決定達到綜合效率的方案，並修正有關法令以適應之。這種脚踏實地，精益求精切實作風，實在使我們的政府與工業界同人感到警覺，而應奮勇的倣效與迎頭趕上。無論在充實戰力完遂勝利上，在調節物價安定民生上，實施增加生產討劃之重要，決非空言倡導所可濟事了。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>各種生產力綜合活用</h3>
<p>日本政府此次決定「派造工廠事業塲間的勞務者案」，并修正勞務調整令及國民徵用令。自此以後，以簡單的手續，從總工廠到附屬工廠，或同種的工廠。鑛山問，對勞動者加隨機應　的支援。而對現有的勤勞力，賦以廣范圍的活動性。這在增強生產中，對打開勞務問題的窮途上，將有很大的貢獻。</p>
<p>目前增產所是需要的資材·設備·勞力各方面，各種現有的力量，自應加以最大限度的活用運營，這已不待多說。各工廠到現在為止，業已非常努力響應增產的呼聲，結果，增產的成績，頗有可觀。但須注意，雖然已經發揮了以各工廠為單位的全部能力，但從全體的關係看來尙未發揮其最高能率。木來，在具有綜合性質的工廠中，都有合作的工廠為單位的全部能力，但從全體的關係看來尙未發揮其最　能率。本來，在具有綜合性質的工廠等，為其下層的組織。部分品完全由本廠一手製造的大槪很少吧！所以總工廠無論怎樣發揮其全部能力，附屬工廠若不跟着有同程度進展，不能說巳經發揮了真正的最高能力。增產狹路之一，正在於此。</p>
<p>照目前的情形在總工廠方面，不能再有更大的能率了。要進一步的增產，不能不有待於承包工廠的改善·况且，這不單是勞務上的問題。即從技術的觀點上，或承包工廠主持者的經營方針上看來，應予改善之處，也不在少。</p>
<p>更有許多東京的總工廠，其大多數的附屬工廠在大阪神戶地方，或者相反，總工廠在大阪神戶，而附屬工廠在東京，這種複雜的關係，不自今日始，因運輸的困難，而其混亂情况下更甚。這些狹路，無論如何不能設法打開。的延長，或總工廠的部分，而是與總工廠成為一體的。應立在這種綜合的觀點，而請求適當的措置。繼此次勞務之綜合的利用之後，在技術，經營等問題上，也應該確立有力的綜合及附屬的關係，同時，在同種工塲之間，也應該有無相通，互相協力，在國家的全體生產機構上，關於資材，設備等活用，使毫無浪費。（翔：譯自八月二十六日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>檢討國內外情勢昨舉行重要懇談　日重臣招待政府首腦午餐</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　大東亞戰爭開始以來，日政府曾屢次在首相官邸招待重臣及樞密院議長，關於戰事及內外各情勢加以說明及舉行懇談，此次則由熏臣方面招待政府首腦，就時局問題舉行懇談，於三十甘在華族會館舉行午餐會，出席者電臣方面，到若槻禮次郞　爵。岡田啓介大將·廣田弘毅氏。近衛文鷹公爵。平沼麒一郞男爵。阿部信行大將。米內光政大將。原嘉道樞密院議長。政府方面到東條曾相兼陸相·島田海相·電光外相·鈴木企劃院總裁等。共進午餐後，對內外情勢各問題作種種懇談，至午後一時餘，始行散會。</p>
<p>天羽總裁闡明時局</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日天羽情報局總裁三十日上午十一時在情報局與駐日各國記者作就任後初次之正式會見，就目前之世界戰局及大東亞建設之實况詳加說明，繼答記者團之問，言明日德義軸心國家對於英美方面企圖於短期問結束戰爭之反攻。具有必勝之確信，茲誌其談話要旨如次：吾人願首對保加利亞國王波利斯三世陛下之薨，代表日本國民表示甚深哀悼之意，而緬　陛下之偉烈功續。</p>
<p>東亞建設猛晋防禦陣容鞏固</p>
<p>回顧四日以來之情形，英美方面始終為陰謀挽回戰局之頹勢及實行政治之謀略，反之我方則於大東亞全域，屢收建之實。軍事方面為鞏固必勝信念，政冶方面有中國確立其完整之主權·緬甸之獨立·以及印度納西亞原住民之參政等，大東亞各民族復歸其本來面目之大事件，已有顯著之進展。經濟方面則由於大東亞各國家各民族之衷心協力，共榮　之基礎愈趨鞏固。文化方面亦有日前舉行之大東亞文學者大會，集各國文學界代表於一堂，共議創造大東亞文學之盛况。在此狀况下，大東亞之共同防衛陣容已固，保護未來政治經濟繁榮之施策，已逐日見諸實施。</p>
<p>西歐戰塲判明英美力量薄弱</p>
<p>德國於東綫乃時採攻勢，時採守勢，其他方面大體均爲防禦態勢，此乃因德國也有戰略上之要點，方得如此，是期戰爭中實無任何時期均爲攻勢之理，時出以防禦戰略，乃屬常然。英美雖一再呼號第二戰綫，但英美陸軍微弱不振之情形在此次戰爭中久已判明，德義報紙對此亦時加指摘，蓋英美於前次大戰時在四歐作戰，曾避於戰壕內，但是時係以法陸軍為中心，故可不出攻勢以待德軍進攻，而今日之英美陸軍已無法陸軍協力，故擬於歐陸發動攻勢，實為勢所迫。英美曾大事誇稱西西里作戰之勝利，然據德方發表英美軍已　失主力三分之一，且英美國內亦有攻撃西西里戰事　廷過久者·此外紐約時報及英國每日快報等亦均會作此種批評，故英美顧慮人的損失，認為係作戰上最感苦惱者。</p>
<p>軸心國盟約仍信守不渝</p>
<p>日德義開係素即親善而尙夫有今日之强固者，義國雖經前此之政變，但其對於三國同盟及單獨不媾和之條約則始終嚴守，並會正式通告協力作戰，英美雖企圖離問義國與日德之關係，而謀使義國單獨媾和，即觀諸義國官民之態度及其國民性，可知彼等一此種企圖已歸失敗，關係一義國國民現在之心理狀態一當係如此：「已被破壞之一都市可重建，已被佔領之土地可恢復，而國際信用一日失墜則不能恢復」也。</p>
<p>對英美會議日不予重視</p>
<p>戰爭爲時愈久英美損害愈大，　時更將增大國內之．不安，且惹起政府內部之對立，及政府與議會衝突等情勢，尤以美國爲甚。美國政府內部之對立日趨激化，且因經濟力下降。影響國民之不安亦頓形增加，加之以全世界各處作戰之美軍時發生不顧這德行為之問題。敵方鑒於此種情勢、應願早日結束戰爭。但軸心方面刻正作有計劃之激擊，忍耐敵軍之反攻，待至最後始予英美以致命之打擊。又天羽情報局總　過去就奎日克會表明見解稱：交戰國首腦會晤出乃所必然，即在此次大戰中亦曾設有常談會議，至其聲明更屬曖昧，即英美之報紙亦對之頗為視，姑不輕論所謂第太平洋一。歐洲第一，抑或第二戰綫，我人均不視為問題，因現在進行戰爭期間，突然指摘交戰國對方之弱點實非其宜。</p>
<h3>實行進攻作戰　日空軍戰果　擊毀美機達三十三架</h3>

<p>南京三十日中央社電　中國國民黨中央執行委員會以上海租界收回後，爲强化黨務推行國策，協力大東亞戰爭起見，特於昨三十日舉行第七七次常務委員會議，決議通過改組上海特別市黨部執行委員會，派劉仰山爲主任委員，馮節，强顯之，陳中，周敏英，奚培文，陳錫祈，滕一鳴等爲委員，許超遠爲書記長。查劉仰山現任中央組織部副部長，國民政府政務參贊，中國青少年團副總監，中央於租界收囘後派大員主持滬市黨部，意義之深長可知，故各方對滬市黨務前途，有極大之期待。</p>
<h3>不滿對日第一主義　蘇聯發動外交反攻　召回駐美大使李維諾夫</h3>
<p>蘇聯突然召囘駐在華盛頓的李維諾夫大使。奎克貝正在舉行重要的英美會談，而全世界正在注視英美蘇之　藕斷絲連的關係時，這李維諾夫的召囘，在平靜的水面上又引了一圈很大的波汶。這是英美政界所受到的最大的衝擊，所以蘇聯與英美的關係，隨着今後戰局的進展，而與以不歡的印象。</p>
<p>據聯合社消息，以羅邱二人為首，聚集了英美政治軍事的當局者約五百人，新聞記老約二百人，濟濟一堂，正在興高采烈的舉行打倒軸心的會談中，這消息，猶如炸彈的爆發，使與會的人們相顧失色。</p>
<p>他們為何要失驚呢？我們來看英美自己所猜測的召還李維諾夫的理由：</p>
<p>奎貝克的陰謀</p>
<p>第一，奎貝克會議為一般軍事的會議，其大概的內容報告到莫斯科後，史太林立即令李維諾夫辭職。英美推測這是因為史太林不滿奎貝克會談決議內容的緣故。蘇聯所再三要求的立即在西歐開闢第二戰綫，在此次的會議中，視若無覩，英美用利於本身的立塲　行歐洲大陸攻勢，例如義大利攻勢及巴爾幹攻勢，這不是蘇聯所希望的。他向英美所要求的，乃是立即在西歐登陸，至少使德國從東戰綫撤退六十個師團。蘇聯的這個希望已經　之二年了，然而此次的英美會談中，毫不顧及。蘇聯獨當德軍主力的止而，業已精疲力盡。本年夏季，拚命出以攻勢以阻止德軍，原期英美在此期問開闢真正的第二戰綫，可是遲遲不見實行。於是蘇聯一天也不能再忍耐了。蘇聯的這種迫不獲已的實情，成為對於英美的諷刺。在此次召還李維諾夫的背後，隱然表示德蘇有和平的可能，而作為一種威齊的　勢。</p>
<p>英美不以為蘇聯的戰力已那樣迫促，而使蘇聯獨自與德惡戰，等待他們兩敗俱傷，而坐收漁利。這種方針，在蘇聯看來，是積毒的根本原因。</p>
<p>强化遠東戰綫</p>
<p>第二，據美方及中立國方面的推測，此次奎貝克會談的中心之一，乃在討論强化太平洋戰綫。為了要强化這太平洋戰綫，於是遂沒有招待與日本維持中立關係的蘇聯的必要。但在蘇聯方面看來，令蘇聯担任對　作戰，而美國則注力於對日戰綫，當然感到不滿，所以李維諾夫的召還即為史太林不慊於英美方　的表示</p>
<p>綜合一般的觀測，奎貝克軍事會談決議的內容：　應蘇聯第二戰綫的要求，製定大陸攻勢計　，　强化各戰綫的海陸空軍，　緬甸戰棧及太平洋戰綫中的對日攻勢計劃，　對重慶的軍隊及武器援助。其他的政治問題，將留待以後討論，說到英美的根本方針，他們不希望在歐戰結束的時候蘇聯尙剩有十分强大的力量，而期待德蘇兩敗俱傷。因此，他們如其深入攻撃德國，　戰後不能不與强大的蘇　對立，這是英美所欲避免的。而且即使依照蘇聯的希望，在歐洲西部現開第二戰綫，可是德國國防軍已預留了充分的餘力，印在反有受到反攻的危險，故時期尙早，不如趁德蘇目　正在死拚的機會，騰出力量轉用其太平洋戰綫。這種方針，自然不是蘇聯所能耐受的，於是蘇聯遂有此次的外交反攻。</p>
<p>土耳其的巨姆烈特報也作同樣的看法。該報說史太林對於英美的轉向日本第一主義，大不以為然，一怒而將素著功绩的李維諾夫召還，是為警告的第一着。更進一齒說：「蘇聯的大膽態度，今後將有何舉動，雖不可知，但無諭如何，蘇聯最後決計獨力而行，英美的外交辭令及其他方法·將無能為力。」</p>
<p>駐英大使召回</p>
<p>第三，也有人以為召還李維諾夫乃因與史太林意見不和的綠故。華盛頓一部分官方人士稱：「李維諾夫的辭職，早有此意，祇因現在適逢其會，所以引起騒動。」此說亦可作參考。可是駐英美的蘇聯大使。前有駐英大使邁斯基的召囘，茲又有李維諾夫的辭職·而且李維諾夫的繼任者，又為年僅三十九武的大使館參事官昇任。大蘇聯同盟國外交代表陣容的貧弱，衆目昭彰。</p>
<p>英美的官方通信，把李維諾夫的辭職看作若無其事。「如邁斯基，李維諾夫二氏這樣的英美通被召囘克里姆林宮，乃是我們的實任。」倫敦泰晤士報說：「年老的李維諾夫，最近　康不佳。」說此舉亞無特別的意義。但在目前的重大時局中。蘇聯所取的大胆行動，可說使嚴重的時局的更趨嚴重。蘇聯的要求，除戰後的歐洲問題，倫敦諸亡命政府的處理間題以外，尙有許多。但最大的却是「立即開闢第二戰綫問題。」這要求如被容納。蘇聯始準備與英美舉行三國會談討論共他回題。</p>
<p>英美進行折衝</p>
<p>英美方面，似已遭遇了不可逾越的障壁了。那就是說，問題在進入政治的逝術之前，暫定條件的朮事間題將被擱置而不能動。英美如不顧蘇聯的這種明白　度，　照預定計劃進行英美的方針時，將有歐洲戰局上引起何種事應？艾登威爾斯的訪問莫斯科計劃究有何結果？四四甲戰局告終後，在英美蘇之開所出現的鴻溝，先已涉及了戰後這三國問將要發生的深刻間題，共前途如何，極堪注目。（翔：譯自八月二十五日西部朝日新開柏林電話）</p>

<h3>廣田部長返滬　談回日印象</h3>
<p>中央社滬訉　日大使館情報部長廣田洋二氏，前於八月中旬為與外務省洽商要公返日一行，茲已公畢，業於二十七日遄返上海，廣田氏於昨日招待外　　記者時，申述在日本勾留約歷二星期之印象如次</p>
<p>勤勞服務</p>
<p>在　戰下之日本國民經濟力，其焦點集中於產業，此為當然者，但關於此點，余深感日水國民之戰時生活確勝過他人一籌。對此雖難以詳加說明，但可舉一例而言之，如學生之勤勞服務是也，此勤勞服務制度實行已在數年前，在目下攻讀中之學生，於放課後或假期中，卽從事勤勞服務，無論對鄉間或都市，於補充勞動力之不足上，實有極大貨獻，此事雖屬　細，但由此可表示日本國民。甚至學生階層，亦莫不熱心產業也。</p>
<p>冷靜態度</p>
<p>余二日本在勾留間的所得最深刻之印象郎為決戰下之日水國民態度殊稱冷靜，戰局之一勝一收，不能引起彼等影響。自目下戰況言，雖不能謂一定有利於軸心國，然日本國民，惟以冷靜自若態度觀察局勢推移，余曾研究為何日水國民能持以冷靜的態度與自信力之理由，經深思下大致可得以下數點：第一，本國民咸自覺大東亞為大規模且長期之作戰。認識戰局之一勝一敗，不足以影響戰爭最後的勝利，局部的問題決不能左右國民之自信力，第二，日本國民對此次戰爭具有最大決心，不但是前綫陸海軍將士，即無論國民之男女老幼，均願以身殉國，關於阿茲島戰況如大水營發表之悲壯慘烈，世日本舉國國民威具有隨阿茲島陸海軍將士之後，以身報國之願望。</p>
<p>戰爭信念</p>
<p>第三，爲日本國民對於此次戰爭之正義心，日本國民具有鞏固信念，即此次戰爭為不可避免者，因此自世界全體民族之立塲土而觀，此戰爭亦極會於正義。余所遇到之日本人，在其層宇間均充溢此種氣概日本國民具有如上述之決意與確信，故戰事雖益形激烈，生活雖愈感不舒適，但彼等心身更為健康，以微笑的態度應付時局。是故，戰時下之日本，從外表而觀，夜問街道黑暗，隨處掘有防空壕，衣服日見簡單，飯盒亦加節約，但進一步觀察其內容，則可感覺日本國民之精神志向，與數年前並不稍遜也。</p>
<h3>補充米麵不足　雜糧明起出糶　亦由米穀配給所撥借</h3>
<p>木期增發之雖糧·分為（一）大麥，（二）課麥（即無壳之原麥），（三）高粱，（四）紅　，是批雜糧亦由中支米穀配給所　借，業由新閘路順豐，閘北光復路恒康，梅白克路恒益，等米　碾軋之中，今日可以全部碾軋竣事，九月一日出糶。</p>

<h3>評言　限制貨品供售</h3>
<p>當局爲竭力杜絕囤積，力謀供應平衡起見，業已諭令各公司商號凡任何物品出售·應酌量限制，不得任其大量選購。由於這個限制貨品供要的告諭，遂使我們　有不得巳於一言者。</p>
<p>在今日本市一般物價趨勞已入正途的時候，惟右食品價格，多成直綫上漲，影響民生嗚最為嚴重，幸賴當局決心加以制止，於日常食品供售之中心樞紐，菜塲，樹立限價牌示，以資遵守，否則，菜塲祇成爲「跑單幫」的利蔽，不復成為市民的食物供應所了。</p>
<p>上海食物價格祗漲不跌的原因，其一固然由於來源稀少，其一言由於供應頻繁。試看酒樓菜館的主人，窮奢極欲的富戶·所至之處，祇顧滿載而歸，初不計量價格；假定限制菜塲所售的價格而外，筏能盱衡情勞，限制其所售的數量，則不但求過於供的狀態，可以消除，因而促成食物價格之低落，抑且我們所要提倡的「節約菜」，亦得從此推行於各大酒樓菜館之中，藉以打破戰時奢侈豪華的惡習，豈不是一舉而兩得嗎？所以，　制貨品　售，非但是厲行配給制度的一個條件，也是促進節約運動的一個力量。</p>
<h3>檢查金融處整飭　銀錢業放款　負責檢查儲蓄業務</h3>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>鎭江三日記</h3>
<p>— 劉漢儒</p>
<p>江蘇省當局爲了完成清鄉任務，本年三月間劃鎭江及其附近各縣爲特別區，實施清鄉工作，期以六個月，至八月底預定步驟次第完成。上　各報社記者，特組織　光團，赴鎭實地考究。記者得撥多興，在鎭留駐三日，歷鄉鎭關心清鄉地區者告。</p>
<p>清鄉地區</p>
<p>鎭江清鄉地區包葀　丹陽，金壇，　　中，包容等縣而成立，自本年三月開始，清鄉第一步工作，是建立封鎖綫，清除綫內不良份子。鎭江區封鎖綫計長二千七百三十公里，自三月初開始徵集竹材，三月十日動工，依照劃定封鎖綫，建築竹籬個月有半，全區圍籬完　，一　實施　　工作，使安份守已的良民，能重度安居樂業的生活。</p>
<p>為了防止不良份子潛出潛入，及統制物資的私運，沿封鎖綫，成立檢問所五十七處，派定工作員五百五十名。執行檢　工作。</p>
<p>在清鄉區內，一切行政敎育工作，都須至頭做起，自清鄉開始從預定目標完畢，六個月期內，要辦理消極的與積極的兩方面工作，具體點說：軍事掃蕩，建立封鎖綫，編查保甲，登記自新戶口，檢舉不良份子，這些是屬於消極方　的，鄉鎭長訓練，保甲長訓練，成立自衛團部，組織警衛工作，以及故等民生，調整經濟等等，是屬於積極方面工作。據負責當局的表示，上述各項工作，大致已達到完成的地步。</p>
<p>清鄉的目的是在使人民能樂業安居，區內人民能自衛，自治，自生。動員了七千九百六十五　工作員，有　　的六個月時期中完成各項預定的工作，主持當局的毅力輿工作員的勤勞，是值得稱許的。</p>
<p>諫璧巡禮</p>
<p>諫璧鎭以及丹徒鄉是屬於鎭江縣第四區的，我們曾設往觀光，沿途邨鎭均有自衛壯丁，守望要道，實行「三自」淸鄉政策。諫璧是一個不能，小的鄉鎭，有商店五十餘家，酒菜飯館倒佔有十家左右，魚肉菜蔬堆滿店堂內，食客甚多，此可反映該鎭人民生活相當的安定。米行前堆滿白米，售價每　一百二十元左右，豬肉每斤三十六元。</p>
<p>諫璧鎭自衛壯丁有Ｘ百名，均受過軍事訓練，在檢閱時，表現步法操練，以及軍事基本動作，相當熟練，同時我們又看到警防演習，自發現土匪至　潰土匪，其間各種動作，迅逆勇捷，配合着地方駐軍，當地警察大隊，縱橫進退，嚴然逼眞。</p>
<p>自衛精神</p>
<p>在鎭江市內，參與第一區自衛團的兩次大檢閱，人數共三中隊，服裝整潔步伐整齊，自　壯丁隊都各有職業，以業餘時問，熱心受訓，獲得軍事初步智識，保衛鄉土，因此我們知道，清鄉區的自衛能力·　是相當雄厚。</p>
<p>確立治安，改善民生，是清鄉的兩大目標，在治安方面，我們已得到一點認識，就是在淸鄉區內人民已能安居·不像從前那樣受到七匪的騷擾。關於改善民生的工作，據縣署負責人的報告，已從廢除苛捐雜稅着手，半年來已廢除復興稅，江面稅，以及田畝捐等等，除了國定稅之外。並未增加地方稅捐名目。此外如抑平物價，協助育蠶，計劃增產·都是業經實行的改善民生，導民向「自生一的大道勇進。</p>
<p>清鄉幹部</p>
<p>清鄉工作實際負責者袁主任學易，張副主任兼鎭江縣長修明，都富有朝氣，他們的表現是年青，活潑，果敢，這一羣的關士。率領了近八千的工作人員，奮關了半年，清除了渝共殘軍，使鎭江人民踏上再生之途。</p>
<p>社會風氣</p>
<p>鎭江市是京滬錢上的大站，因為接近南京與上海，所以社會風氣亦是南京與上海化作，負責當局，有從速舉辦的必要。</p>
<p>大東歐塲是模仿上海高樂歌塲的一個娛樂塲所，點戲，歌女侍坐，一如上海南京，在這裏我們可看見一擲千金無吝色的豪客，據說還有從家內打電話點戲，令歌女趨府侍座的客人，這些關客當中，又據聞有一部份是公務員，「勤勞儉樸」，是主席常常昭示於人民的，「儉以養廉」是政治人員的守則，我們但願所聞非實，本春秋責備賢者之義，希望公務員常中有則從速改之。</p>

<h3>從倡辦敎職員消費合作社說起</h3>
<p>— 馬仲賚</p>
<p>我是一個教員，在大中學担任功課，於今已十餘年。並非久而生厭，我早經選定敎育做我的終身職業，我對於敎育有莫大的興趣，但在近年，我時常感覺煩悶和痛苦。上學期我在兩個大學裹每星期担任三十四小時的功課，每月的收入、還不到二千元，而開支則須三千多，提襟見肘，煞費安排，每聞某物漲價，輒為心驚肉跳，若遇妻見疾病，更是徬徨失措。我曾想我為人家敎育子弟，爲國家培植人才，終日口講指劃，而所獲的報酬，還不及一個黃包車夫，這社會未免大不公平丁！生活的威脅，把我的心思攪亂了，衣食的打算，使我的心神疲乏了，這更影響了我的工作。為了憂應生活，心思不專，為了任課過多，時問不夠，我深覺我的工作效果，遠不如以前的了。自知所負責任的重大，和所任工作的重要。而竟不能盡心的做去，雖然我已盡力的做了。一個天天負着生活的重担的人，一個時時受着生活的迫脅的人，其所感着的焦慮，一個不滿意於自己的工作的人，一個抱着「誤人子弟」的疚心的人，其所感着的痛；，是決非他人所能知道的。我相信這焦慮和痛苦，是上海的每個教員所感覺到的。</p>
<p>最近，蔣壽同君建議設辦敎職員消費合作社，確是解決教職員生活的一部分困難的良好方法，深望早日實現。「黃沙搓繩起頭難」，上海的敎職員，包括大中小學，為數不少，平時並無組織，不相聯絡，現在要消費合作，正如黃沙搓繩，非易事。且一般敎員，頗多受傳統的思想和因襲的習慣的影響，恥於言利，簞瓢白安者有之，漠不關心，坐觀成敗者有之；學校當局，又頗多不為教育前途和教員生計着想，更怕節外生枝，損及水身利益，或因循敷衍，或阻撓破壞。為求敎職員悄費合作社的迅速成立，我有如下的意見：先由幾個熱心的敎員，新織一個臨時籌備會議訂草案。一方面廣告上海教職員，投函登記，登記信內，載明姓名，服務學校担任職務或課程，佳址，家庭人口，和認股數目。一方面請求社會人士的補助，接洽必需物品的配給。待有相當眉目·召開社員大會，推舉負責職員，議定實施辦法。辦法要看加入的人數與情形而定，或以校為單位，或以區為單位。二十四日申報有十五位敎員的集體意見，或者就請那幾位偏勞籌備，當仁不讓，希望不要過謙。</p>
<p>我還有點意思，就是消費合作社成立丁，也未必就能解決敎員的生活困難。因為有許多東四，還須向零售商店職員。敎員的薪水，和物價相比，相差的距離，實在太遠了。我且先做個比較，戰前的大學薪水，每小時二元半至三元，生活費每月一百二十元；上學期的薪水，每小時十二元至十五元，生活費每月三千餘元。薪水加五倍，生活費加三十倍，而物價呢·少說也加了一百倍。有限的衣服，已經穿破了，些衛的積蓄，已經貼完了，山窮水盡，無以為繼，是現在敎員所處的境遇。不能安居，何能樂業？教育效率的低落，學生程度的退步·是不可否認的事實，是我們所極端痛心的現象。這影響暫時還看不出來，將來就要發生嚴重的結果，於國家民族是多麼的危險。但我們又有什麼法想！誠如廿五日申報社評所說：「改善敎育提高效率最基本的還當從改善敎員生活提高敢員薪水開始」。我以為敎員的薪水，至少要比戰前增加二十倍。增加敎員的薪水，難免述帶的增加學生的學費，這或者會有人非議。固有貧寒的家長，早巳不勝負担子弟的入學了，但也有豪奪得的學生，浪費無度，一雙皮鞋，一套西裝，或少進幾次戲院舞廳和菜館，就夠付一學期的學費而有餘了。就是把學費增加到一千五百元，也不過是戰前的三十倍而已。從前一角錢可坐黃包車的路程，現在恐非五元錢是不行的了。我以為學費儘可提高，清寒學生的免費額必須增加，成績特優的，還應給以獎學金，因為家境貧寒的讀不起書，不單是學費負担不起，平日衣食書籍等費，超過學費多矣。這一點希望學校當局在決定敎員薪水和學生學費的時陝，鄭重的考慮。</p>
<p>為奠定國家的基礎為培養復與的實力，而提高敎育效率，安定敎員生活，請學校當局不要為顧慮小惠而忽視大端；請社會人士寄予同情和諒解，請全體敎員，不要為淸高虛名而作教育罪人，奮起討論。大家努方，為國家民族改進教育！</p>

        <h1>1943.08.31</h1>
<h3>Increased Production Requires Catching Up</h3>
<p>Recently, those discussing China's economic problems invariably focus on issues such as grain prices and increasing production. The grain problem is, in fact, a part of the broader issues of prices and production increase. Therefore, broadly speaking, the core of China's current economic problems lies in prices and increased production, two sides of the same coin. This is because increased production is a major factor in adjusting prices. To thoroughly resolve the price issue, one must actively engage in increasing production. This clear economic principle is already understood by everyone, and the government has long established it in the overall economic policy framework. Logically, with "increased production" established as a national policy by the government and understood by the people, it should be smoothly implemented. However, upon closer examination, has the agricultural sector promoted increased production plans? Or has the industrial sector promoted increased production plans? Or is it just that plans remain plans, and reality remains reality? Looking at the current state of production in Shanghai's industrial sector alone, let alone increasing production, even maintaining the existing output is proving problematic, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that when Chairman Wang visited and inspected the Zhenjiang rural areas, he answered questions raised by journalists, saying: There has always been a significant divide between the old Shanghai concessions and the inland areas. The Qingxiang region produces rice, while the five million residents of Shanghai consume it. The Qingxiang region farmers grow cotton, while Shanghai factories spin and weave cloth. There is a black market for yarn and cloth, and the cotton farmers who painstakingly grow cotton cannot afford to buy cloth. The rice farmers who painstakingly harvest rice cannot afford to buy cloth even after exchanging the rice for money. This proves the separation between the old Shanghai concessions and the inland areas. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the government should actively promote a unified economic policy. The Qingxiang region has abundant agriculture, while Shanghai has abundant light industry. A comprehensive plan should be made to develop agriculture in the Qingxiang region to match the development of light industry in Shanghai. Agriculture is what the Qingxiang region should strive for, and industry is what Shanghai should strive for. It is firmly believed that after the recovery of the concessions, a unified economic policy will be smoothly implemented.</p>
<p>Upon careful examination of what Chairman Wang has revealed, it is nothing more than an expectation that producers in both industry and agriculture will strive to produce in their respective positions, connecting rural agriculture with urban industrial production, to realize a unified economic policy. We believe that the industrial production sector in Shanghai will greatly agree with this proposal, and it can even be said that they have been seeking it. This is because the phenomenon of either maximizing or halting production is not something the industrial sector itself desires, but rather something they are forced to do due to environmental constraints. We sincerely hope that while the government advocates increasing production and expects Shanghai to strive for industrial production, it must also pay close attention to the causes hindering production and use political power to remove these obstacles. If the causes hindering production are not thoroughly removed first, then the phrase "increased production" will ultimately become mere lip service.</p>
<p>We should also look back at how our allied nation Japan values increased production, never relaxing its efforts at any time or place. They maximize the utilization and operation of resources, equipment, and labor, which are most needed for increasing production, and consequently achieve good results. However, they believe that although each factory has exerted its full capacity as an individual unit, the overall capacity from the perspective of comprehensive relationships has not yet been fully utilized. Therefore, the government has decided to implement a plan to achieve comprehensive efficiency and amend relevant laws to adapt to it. This practical, meticulous, and realistic approach should serve as a wake-up call for our government and industrial colleagues, prompting us to emulate it bravely and catch up. Whether it is to enhance combat power to achieve victory or to regulate prices to stabilize people's livelihoods, the implementation of increased production plans is crucial and cannot be achieved through empty advocacy.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Utilization of Various Productive Forces</h3>
<p>The Japanese government has decided on "the plan for dispatching workers between factories and workplaces" and has revised the Labor Adjustment Ordinance and the National Conscription Ordinance. From now on, with simple procedures, support for laborers will be provided randomly from general factories to affiliated factories or factories of the same type, and mines. The existing labor force will be given a wide range of activities. This will greatly contribute to opening up a path in the dead end of labor problems in enhancing production.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the various existing forces in materials, equipment, and labor, which are currently needed for increased production, should be utilized and operated to the maximum extent. Until now, each factory has already been working very hard to respond to the call for increased production, and as a result, the achievements in increased production are quite impressive. However, it must be noted that although the full capacity of each factory as a unit has been utilized, the maximum efficiency has not yet been achieved from the perspective of the overall relationship. Originally, in factories with comprehensive characteristics, the full capacity of cooperative factories as units exists, but the maximum efficiency has not yet been achieved from the perspective of the overall relationship. Originally, in factories with comprehensive characteristics, etc., they are the lower-level organization. There are probably very few cases where all parts are manufactured by the factory itself! Therefore, no matter how much the general factory exerts its full capacity, it cannot be said that the real maximum capacity has been exerted if the affiliated factories do not follow suit with the same degree of progress. One of the bottlenecks in increased production lies here.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, there can be no greater efficiency in the general factory. Further increasing production cannot but depend on the improvement of subcontracting factories. Moreover, this is not just a labor problem. Even from a technical point of view, or from the perspective of the management policies of the heads of subcontracting factories, there are not a few areas that need to be improved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many general factories in Tokyo have most of their affiliated factories in the Osaka-Kobe area, or vice versa, general factories in Osaka-Kobe, and affiliated factories in Tokyo. This complex relationship did not start today, and the chaotic situation is even worse due to transportation difficulties. These bottlenecks must be found ways to break through. The extension of the factory, or part of the general factory, is integrated with the general factory. Appropriate measures should be requested from this comprehensive perspective. Following the comprehensive utilization of labor this time, powerful comprehensive and subordinate relationships should also be established in technical and management issues. At the same time, there should be mutual communication and cooperation between factories of the same type, and there should be no waste in the utilization of materials and equipment in the overall national production mechanism. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, August 26)</p>

<h3>Important Discussions Held Yesterday to Review Domestic and International Situations; Japanese Senior Officials Host Luncheon for Government Leaders</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has repeatedly invited senior officials and the President of the Privy Council to the Prime Minister's official residence to explain and discuss the war situation and various domestic and international situations. This time, the senior officials hosted a luncheon for government leaders to discuss the current situation. The luncheon was held at the Peer's Club on the 30th. The attendees from the senior officials' side included Count Reijiro Wakatsuki, Admiral Keisuke Okada, Mr. Hirota Koki, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, General Nobuyuki Abe, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, and President of the Privy Council, Mr. Yoshimichi Hara. The attendees from the government side included Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Shimada, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and President of the Planning Board Suzuki, etc. After lunch, various discussions were held on domestic and international situations and various issues until after 1:00 PM, when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Director General Amau Explains the Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Director General Amau of the Japanese Information Bureau met with reporters from various countries stationed in Japan at the Information Bureau at 11:00 AM on the 30th for the first official meeting since taking office. He explained in detail the current world war situation and the actual situation of the Greater East Asia construction. He then answered questions from the press corps, stating that the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy have the firm conviction of certain victory against the Anglo-American attempts to end the war in the short term. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: We would first like to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the Japanese people on the passing of His Majesty King Boris III of Bulgaria, and mourn His Majesty's great achievements and contributions.</p>
<p>The Construction of East Asia is Vigorously Advancing and the Defense Posture is Solidified</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation since the fourth, the Anglo-American side has consistently been plotting to reverse the declining war situation and implement political schemes. Conversely, on our side, we have repeatedly achieved construction results throughout the Greater East Asia region. In the military aspect, we have solidified our belief in certain victory. In the political aspect, China has established its complete sovereignty, Burma has become independent, and the indigenous people of Indonesia have participated in politics. Significant progress has been made in major events such as the restoration of the original identities of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. In the economic aspect, the foundation of co-prosperity is becoming more and more solid due to the heartfelt cooperation of the various countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. In the cultural aspect, there was also the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference held the other day, which brought together representatives from the literary circles of various countries to discuss the creation of Greater East Asia literature. Under this situation, the common defense posture of Greater East Asia has been solidified, and measures to protect the future political and economic prosperity are being implemented day by day.</p>
<p>The Weakness of Anglo-American Forces is Clear in the Western European Theater</p>
<p>Germany is sometimes on the offensive and sometimes on the defensive on the Eastern Front, and is generally on the defensive in other aspects. This is because Germany also has strategic key points, which allows it to do so. In fact, there is no time in the war when it is all offensive. It is natural to adopt defensive strategies from time to time. Although the Anglo-Americans have repeatedly called for a Second Front, the weakness and lack of vitality of the Anglo-American armies have long been clear in this war. The German and Italian newspapers have also repeatedly pointed this out. This is because the Anglo-Americans were fighting in trenches in Europe during the previous war, but at that time they were centered on the French army, so they could wait for the German army to attack without launching an offensive. Today's Anglo-American army cannot cooperate with the French army, so it is forced to launch an offensive in Europe. The Anglo-Americans have greatly boasted of the victory in the Sicilian campaign, but according to the German side, the Anglo-American forces have already lost one-third of their main force, and there are criticisms within the Anglo-American countries that the Sicilian campaign lasted too long. In addition, the New York Times and the British Daily Express have also made such criticisms. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans are concerned about the loss of human lives and consider it to be the most distressing aspect of the war.</p>
<p>The Axis Alliance Remains Unwavering</p>
<p>The relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has always been friendly and strong as it is today. Although Italy has undergone a previous political change, it has consistently adhered to the Tripartite Pact and the treaty of no separate peace, and has formally notified us of its cooperation in the war. Although the Anglo-Americans have attempted to alienate Italy from Japan and Germany in order to seek a separate peace with Italy, judging from the attitude of the Italian officials and people and their national character, it can be seen that their attempt has failed. The psychological state of the Italian people now is: "A city that has been destroyed can be rebuilt, and a land that has been occupied can be restored, but international credibility cannot be restored once it is lost."</p>
<p>Japan Does Not Attach Importance to the Anglo-American Conference</p>
<p>The longer the war lasts, the greater the damage to the Anglo-Americans, and the greater the domestic unrest will be, and it will also cause conflicts within the government and conflicts between the government and parliament, especially in the United States. The conflicts within the US government are intensifying, and the decline in economic power has led to an increase in national anxiety. In addition, the US military, which is fighting all over the world, has repeatedly caused problems of disregard for ethics. In view of this situation, the enemy should want to end the war as soon as possible. However, the Axis side is currently launching planned attacks, enduring the enemy's counter-offensives, and waiting until the end to give the Anglo-Americans a fatal blow. In addition, Director General Amau of the Information Bureau stated in the past regarding the Quebec Conference: It is inevitable that the heads of the belligerent countries will meet. Even in this war, there have been standing conferences. His statement is even more ambiguous. Even the Anglo-American newspapers are not very concerned about it. For the time being, we will not lightly discuss the so-called First Pacific or First/Second Front. We do not consider it a problem, because it is not appropriate to suddenly point out the weaknesses of the opposing belligerent countries during the current period of war.</p>
<h3>Implementing Offensive Operations; Japanese Air Force's War Results: 33 American Planes Destroyed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force stationed in China has repeatedly launched preemptive strikes against the US Air Force and rear bases stationed nearby, and has also inflicted heavy blows on the invading US Air Force.

A total of thirty-three aircraft were shot down and destroyed, (six of which have not yet been confirmed). Although the Japanese aircraft lost eight aircraft this time, the enemy was shot down and destroyed thirty-three aircraft due to the fierce attacks and interceptions of the Japanese aircraft. The ratio between the two sides is four to one, which shows the absolute superiority of the Japanese aircraft.</p>

<h3>London Reports: Major War to Unfold; Roosevelt and Churchill Plan to Meet Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Dentsu News Agency reports that a German political report states: A telegram from Quebec says that British Prime Minister Churchill has decided to postpone his departure from the United States in order to fish in the Canadian mountains. Although Churchill enjoys fishing, this fishing trip is even more necessary, as Churchill is no longer young and has been extremely exhausted both physically and mentally after prolonged contact with Roosevelt. It is appropriate to take a short break in the mountains, and American newspapers report that Churchill and Roosevelt are scheduled to meet again within the next week. If so, then the Quebec Conference has clearly not yet ended, but has had to be temporarily suspended due to the mental exhaustion of the participants. At the same time, London is rife with rumors that Roosevelt and Churchill are waiting for the major war to unfold this weekend in order to issue a joint declaration. The so-called major war refers to the Second Front. Moscow has probably put the greatest pressure on the Quebec Conference, so the United Kingdom and the United States have had to be forced into action.</p>
<h3>Central Executive Committee Resolves to Reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters; Appoints Liu Yangshan as Chairman</h3>

Therefore, all parties have great expectations for the future of party affairs in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction with Japan-First Policy: Soviet Union Launches Diplomatic Counteroffensive; Recalls Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union has suddenly recalled its ambassador to Washington, Litvinov. While the important British-American talks are taking place in Quebec, and the whole world is watching the tenuous relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, this recall of Litvinov has stirred up a great deal of ripples on the calm waters. This is the biggest shock received by the political circles of Britain and America, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and America may progress with an unpleasant impression in the future as the war develops.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch, about five hundred people, including the British and American political and military authorities, headed by Luo and Qiu, and about two hundred journalists, gathered together, and were happily holding talks to defeat the Axis powers. The news was like a bomb explosion, making the people present look at each other in dismay.</p>
<p>Why were they so shocked? Let's look at the reasons for recalling Litvinov speculated by Britain and America themselves:</p>
<p>Quebec Conspiracy</p>
<p>First, the Quebec Conference was a general military conference, and after the general content was reported to Moscow, Stalin immediately ordered Litvinov to resign. Britain and America speculated that this was because Stalin was dissatisfied with the content of the Quebec Conference resolutions. The immediate opening of a second front in Western Europe, which the Soviet Union has repeatedly requested, was regarded as non-existent in this conference. Britain and America are using a position that is beneficial to themselves to carry out an offensive on the European continent, such as the Italian offensive and the Balkan offensive, which is not what the Soviet Union wants. What he asked of Britain and America was to land immediately in Western Europe, at least to make Germany withdraw sixty divisions from the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union has had this hope for two years, but the British and American talks did not take it into account at all. The Soviet Union is single-handedly resisting the main force of the German army, and has been exhausted. This summer, it tried its best to launch an offensive to stop the German army, originally hoping that Britain and America would open a real second front during this period, but it has not been implemented. As a result, the Soviet Union could not bear it any longer. This unavoidable reality of the Soviet Union has become an irony to Britain and America. Behind this recall of Litvinov, there is a hidden possibility of peace between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is used as a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>Britain and America do not think that the Soviet Union's combat power is so urgent, but make the Soviet Union fight alone with Germany, waiting for them to be hurt on both sides, and reap the benefits. In the Soviet Union's view, this policy is the root cause of accumulating poison.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Far East Front</p>
<p>Second, according to speculation from the United States and neutral countries, one of the focuses of the Quebec Conference was to discuss strengthening the Pacific Front. In order to strengthen this Pacific Front, it was not necessary to entertain the Soviet Union, which maintains neutrality with Japan. However, in the Soviet Union's view, making the Soviet Union responsible for the war against Germany, while the United States focuses on the war against Japan, is naturally dissatisfied, so the recall of Litvinov is Stalin's expression of dissatisfaction with the British and American policies.</p>
<p>Comprehensive general observations, the contents of the Quebec military conference resolutions: to meet the Soviet Union's requirements for a second front, formulate a continental offensive plan; to strengthen the naval, land and air forces of each front; the offensive plan against Japan in the Burma battlefield and the Pacific Front; military and weapons assistance to Chongqing. Other political issues will be discussed later. Speaking of the fundamental policy of Britain and America, they do not want the Soviet Union to still have a very strong force at the end of the European war, but expect Germany and the Soviet Union to be hurt on both sides. Therefore, if they deeply attack Germany, they cannot but confront the powerful Soviet Union after the war, which is what Britain and America want to avoid. Moreover, even if the second front is opened in Western Europe as the Soviet Union hoped, the German National Defence Forces have reserved sufficient surplus strength, and there is a risk of being counterattacked. Therefore, the time is still early. It is better to take advantage of the opportunity that Germany and the Soviet Union are currently fighting to the death to free up forces and transfer them to the Pacific Front. This policy is naturally not tolerable for the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union has launched this diplomatic counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Turkey's "Giant Mulet Report" also made the same view. The report said that Stalin was very dissatisfied with the British and American shift to the Japan-first policy, and recalled Litvinov, who had been known for his merits, in anger, which was the first warning. It further stated: "It is impossible to know what actions the Soviet Union's bold attitude will take in the future, but no matter what, the Soviet Union will finally decide to act independently, and the diplomatic rhetoric and other methods of Britain and America will be powerless."</p>
<p>Recall of Ambassador to the UK</p>
<p>Third, some people think that the recall of Litvinov was due to disagreement with Stalin. Some officials in Washington said: "Litvinov's resignation has been intended for a long time, but it has caused a commotion because it is happening now." This statement can also be used as a reference. However, the Soviet ambassador to Britain and the United States. First, there was the recall of Ambassador Maisky to the UK, and now there is Litvinov's resignation. Moreover, Litvinov's successor was promoted to the embassy counselor at the young age of thirty-nine. The weakness of the Soviet Union's Allied diplomatic representation lineup is obvious.</p>
<p>The official communication of Britain and America treats Litvinov's resignation as if nothing happened. "The recall of such British and American experts as Maisky and Litvinov to the Kremlin is our reality." The London Times said: "The old Litvinov has not been in good health recently." It said that this move has no special significance. However, in the current major situation, the bold actions taken by the Soviet Union can be said to make the serious situation even more serious. The Soviet Union's demands include not only the post-war European issue and the handling of the London exile governments, but also many others. But the biggest is "the issue of immediately opening a second front." If this request is accepted, the Soviet Union will be prepared to hold a three-nation meeting with Britain and America to discuss other issues.</p>
<p>Britain and America are engaging in coordination</p>
<p>The British and American sides seem to have encountered an insurmountable obstacle. That is to say, before the problem enters the realm of political tactics, the issue of military affairs as a temporary condition will be put aside and cannot be moved. If Britain and America ignore this clear attitude of the Soviet Union and proceed with the British and American policy according to the scheduled plan, what kind of events will occur in the European war situation? What will be the result of Eden-Wells' visit to Moscow? The gap that has appeared in the British, American, and Soviet openings after the end of the Sino-Japanese War has already involved the profound issues that will occur between these three countries after the war. Its future is extremely noteworthy. (Xiang: Translated from the Berlin phone call of the West Asahi Shimbun on August 25)</p>

According to a reliable source from the Central News Agency: This case has been integrated, and in the future, all matters concerning grain control, purchase and distribution will be handled by the Commercial Control Association. The personnel have been internally determined, and personnel with rich experience in the grain industry will be responsible for the preparation. Because grain collection, transportation and distribution have not been fully perfected, it is expected that under the strong control and unification, grain management will be able to meet the needs of people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Ren Yunpeng Broadcast</h3>
<p>The broadcast celebrating the recovery of the concessions held by the Municipal Propaganda Office on the 30th was undertaken by Ren Lingzhu, the general manager of the New Joint Venture.

The words are very concise.</p>
<h3>"Counterfeit Banknote Identification Table" Unreliable; Refer to Newspaper Reports</h3>
<p>Recently, there are so-called "counterfeit banknote weaving tables" on the road, selling to everyone. There are many counterfeit banknote numbers listed on it, but according to the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank, the counterfeit banknotes that have been discovered and confirmed are only 10-yuan banknotes with D——A, D——B, D——C, D——D prefixes and S suffixes, 5-yuan banknotes with D——P, D——N prefixes and D suffixes, etc. The overseas banknote identification table sold on the market is actually unreliable. The identification points published in the newspapers on the 28th of this month should still be used as the standard. If you need these identification points, or have any questions, you can go directly to the bank on the Bund to ask for them.</p>

<h3>Minister Hirota Returns to Shanghai; Talks About Impressions of Returning to Japan</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, Hirota Yoji, the information minister of the Japanese Embassy, ​​returned to Japan in mid-August to negotiate important matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 27th. When Mr. Hirota received foreign reporters yesterday, he stated his impressions of staying in Japan for about two weeks as follows:</p>
<p>Diligent Service</p>
<p>Under the war, the focus of Japan's national economic power is concentrated on industry, which is natural, but on this point, I deeply feel that the wartime life of the Japanese people is indeed better than others. Although it is difficult to explain this in detail, an example can be cited, such as the diligent service of students. This diligent service system has been implemented for several years. Students who are currently studying engage in diligent service after school or during holidays. Whether in rural or urban areas, it makes a great contribution to supplementing the shortage of labor. Although this matter is very trivial, it can show the Japanese people, even the student class, are enthusiastic about the industry.</p>
<p>Calm Attitude</p>
<p>The most profound impression I gained during my stay in Japan was that the attitude of the Japanese people under the decisive battle was very calm, and the victory or loss of the war could not affect them. Judging from the current war situation, it cannot be said that it is necessarily beneficial to the Axis powers, but the Japanese people observe the development of the situation with a calm and composed attitude. I have studied why the Japanese people can maintain a calm attitude and self-confidence. After deep consideration, I can roughly obtain the following points: First, the Japanese people are all aware that the Greater East Asia is a large-scale and long-term operation. Recognizing that the victory or defeat of the war is not enough to affect the final victory of the war, local problems can never sway the people's self-confidence. Second, the Japanese people have the greatest determination for this war. Not only the officers and soldiers of the army and navy on the front line, but also the men, women, old and young of the people, are willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. Regarding the tragic and tragic situation of the Battle of Attu Island as announced by Oyama, the national people of Japan and the United States have the desire to follow the officers and soldiers of the army and navy on Attu Island and sacrifice their lives for the country.</p>
<p>War Belief</p>
<p>Third, the Japanese people have a solid belief in the justice of this war, that is, this war is unavoidable. Therefore, from the standpoint of all the peoples of the world, this war is also extremely conducive to justice. The Japanese people I met were filled with this kind of spirit between their layers. The Japanese people have the above-mentioned determination and conviction, so although the war is becoming more and more fierce, and life is becoming more and more uncomfortable, their minds and bodies are healthier, and they face the situation with a smiling attitude. Therefore, from the outside, Japan under the war is dark at night on the streets, air-raid shelters are dug everywhere, clothes are becoming simpler, and lunch boxes are also more frugal, but further observation of its content can feel that the spirit and aspirations of the Japanese people are not inferior to those of a few years ago.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Supplement of Rice and Flour; Miscellaneous Grains Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow; Also Borrowed from the Rice and Grain Distribution Office</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains issued this time are divided into (1) barley, (2) naked barley (that is, unmalted raw barley), (3) sorghum, (4) red sorghum. This batch of miscellaneous grains is also borrowed from the Central China Rice and Grain Distribution Office. They are being milled by Shunfeng on Xinzha Road, Hengkang on Zhabei Guangfu Road, and Hengyi on Mei Baike Road. All milling can be completed today, and they will be sold on September 1.</p>
<p>The Allocation Section Notified the Rice Shops Yesterday</p>
<p>The Rice Flour Allocation Section of the Economic Department of the First District Office notified the rice shops yesterday, saying: "The office announced on August 3 that it sincerely invited Taiwan to negotiate. Now that the validity date of the rice purchase certificate of the 45th joint ticket has been changed to September 5, the rice purchase certificate of that period should be returned to the office on Tuesday, September 7. In addition, the validity date of the second miscellaneous grain purchase certificate is September 5. Please return the miscellaneous grain certificate of that period to the office together with the 45th rice purchase certificate on Tuesday, September 7. The 45th flour certificate must be returned to the office on the originally scheduled September 1.</p>
<p>Rice Tickets Must Be Claimed Before the Deadline</p>
<p>The West District Rice and Grain Office of the First District recently sent a letter to the Lianbao chiefs, stating that from September 1, the head of the household must claim the rice tickets according to the date indicated on the back of the housing donation ticket. Otherwise, they will be punished. The Baojia chiefs of the district have issued separate orders to the heads of households to follow.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Reiterates the Prohibition; Measures to Restrict Banquets; Must Be Strictly Abided by Starting from September 1; All Citizens of the City Should Practice Economy</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, the Shanghai Special City Government recently issued a notice, stating that from September 1 of this year, the banquet restriction measures of the National Government should be strictly followed. Both restaurants and banquet hosts must strictly abide by and strictly abstain from violations. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be punished without exception. At the same time, it sent a letter to the New Movement Promotion Branch to assist in publicity, and ordered the first, second, and third police bureaus to instruct all types of restaurants to comply. The notice is recorded as follows: For the sake of the notice, at this time of material shortage, in the autumn of rising prices, all of our people should strive to save. However, recently, rice boxes and banquets have become increasingly extravagant. A banquet costs the assets of middle-class people. There is wine and meat in the mansions, and bones on the roads. Reflecting on oneself, one should not be at ease. Restrictions should be strictly enforced to restrain vulgar customs. The National Government had already promulgated the banquet restriction measures and ordered them to the whole country, but after a long time, they were ignored and the implementation was ineffective. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the prohibition should be reiterated. From September 1 of this year, the city's restaurants must strictly abide by and must not exceed the limits. It is also hoped that all citizens of the city will strictly abstain from violations, so as to do their best to save and show their enthusiasm for serving the country. Anyone who is found to have violated the rules, whether it is a restaurant or a banquet host, will be punished without exception. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee to assist in publicity, and separately ordering the first, second, and third police bureaus to instruct all restaurants to comply, this notice is hereby issued for public knowledge.</p>

Veteran Wen Jingren maintained his original form in the 200-yard freestyle semifinal, leading the entire way. In another group, Bai William's performance was almost the same as Bai's. The championship title is destined to be contested by Wen and Bai. The 60-yard backstroke competition was intense, with Wang Zhongcheng and Xu Shouqiang proving their extraordinary skills, winning the first and second group championships respectively.

<h3>Commentary: Restrictions on the Supply and Sale of Goods</h3>
<p>In order to do its utmost to eliminate hoarding and strive for balanced supply, the authorities have already ordered all companies and firms to moderately restrict the sale of any goods and not to allow them to be purchased in large quantities. This announcement of restrictions on the supply of goods forces us to say a few words.</p>
<p>At a time when the general prices in this city are already on the right track, the prices of food have mostly risen in a straight line, which has the most serious impact on people's livelihood. Fortunately, the authorities are determined to stop this, and price limits have been established in the central hubs for the supply and sale of daily food, such as vegetable markets, for compliance. Otherwise, the vegetable market will only become a place for "individual runners" to profit and will no longer be a food supply for the citizens.</p>
<p>The reasons why food prices in Shanghai only rise and do not fall are, firstly, due to the scarcity of sources, and secondly, due to the frequency of supply. Just look at the owners of restaurants and taverns, and the extremely extravagant rich households; wherever they go, they only care about returning fully loaded, without calculating the price. Assuming that in addition to restricting the prices sold in the vegetable market, if we can also consider the situation and restrict the quantity sold, then not only can the state of demand exceeding supply be eliminated, thereby promoting the decline of food prices, but also the "economical dishes" that we want to promote can be promoted in major restaurants and taverns, thereby breaking the bad habits of extravagance and luxury during the war. Wouldn't this be killing two birds with one stone? Therefore, restricting the sale of goods is not only a condition for implementing the rationing system but also a force for promoting the thrift movement.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Financial Affairs Office Rectifies Loans from Money Shops, Responsible for Inspecting Savings Business</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of the Ministry of Finance's measures to restrict loans from money shops, had already issued a notice to the money shop associations to forward it to all financial institutions for handling. Now, among the accounts listed in the loan sub-account details sent to the office by various financial institutions, there are many that comply with the Ministry's orders, but there are also many that conflict with the Ministry's regulations. Therefore, in order to reorganize the loan business of various financial institutions, it has ordered them to find ways to recover the loans that have already been issued but do not comply with the Ministry's orders, and to report them at any time for verification.</p>
<p>In addition, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office, under orders to be responsible for inspecting the business of savings banks and collecting a guarantee of one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits, has already sent letters to various branches to forward to various savings banks for compliance. Now, an excerpt of the Savings Deposit Guarantee Reserve is as follows:</p>
<p>Deposit Method:</p>
<p>(1) The savings loan guarantee reserve shall be at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits, equivalent to government bonds, treasury bills, and other reliable collateral. The total amount of deposits stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the total balance at the end of each half-year. (2) The Central Savings Bank may, when necessary, hire experts to assess the value of the various collateral items of the guarantee reserve. (3) The Ministry of Finance may, at any time, entrust the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the business content of savings banks and the actual situation of all their assets. (4) Savings banks may apply to exchange the same type of collateral items for the various collateral items of the guarantee reserve at the end of each month. When the value of the collateral items in the preceding paragraph fluctuates excessively, the Central Reserve Bank may order the savings bank to make up the difference or return the excess. (5) The Central Reserve Bank shall, at the end of each month, present a list of the guarantee reserves deposited by savings banks to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<p>Economic Management Section Adjusts Association Registration</p>
<p>The Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Department of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality has been formally established and has begun operations, continuing to handle various tasks of the former Public Works Bureau's Association Section. It will also strictly manage various economic groups in the first and second districts. It has also stipulated that all trade associations that have been reorganized and completed under the guidance of the former Economic and Food Bureau but have not yet registered with the former Association Section must register with the section and obtain a license. It also limits the time for associations and groups that have been dissolved to surrender their previous licenses in order to comply with the law; otherwise, they will be banned.</p>

<p>Those Who Have Already Received Educational Aid from One Organization Should Not Receive It Again The Newspaper and Other Educational Aid Organizations Will Coordinate Investigation to Ensure Prudence</p>
<p>The fifth Shenbao Educational Aid Fund is about to end. Because various educational aid organizations in this city aim to benefit outstanding students from poor families by offering student loans, scholarships, and educational aid funds, which share the same goals as the educational aid movement of this newspaper. Among them, a few students from poor families are eager to seek assistance, fearing that one effort may not be successful, so they apply to other educational aid organizations at the same time. As a result, both sides are approved. In order to seriously uphold the original intention of donors who enthusiastically support education, this newspaper is conducting an investigation into this situation. It hopes that the authorities of various schools will do their best to assist, and also hopes that if any of the students applying in groups have the above situation, they should immediately decide to receive the aid from any one organization. Otherwise, once it is verified, this newspaper will seek compensation from the school authorities and guarantors.</p>

<h3>Three Days in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru</p>
<p>In order to complete the task of rural pacification, the Jiangsu Provincial authorities designated Zhenjiang and its surrounding counties as a special zone in March of this year and implemented rural pacification work, with the goal of completing the planned steps in stages by the end of August over a period of six months. Reporters from various newspapers were specially organized into a sightseeing group to go to Zhenjiang for on-the-spot investigation. This reporter was fortunate to be able to stay in Zhenjiang for three days and report to those concerned about the rural pacification areas in the countryside and towns.</p>
<p>Rural Pacification Area</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang rural pacification area includes Danyang, Jintan, Jurong, and Jurong counties. It was established starting in March of this year. The first step of rural pacification work is to establish a blockade line to remove undesirable elements within the line. The Zhenjiang District blockade line is 2,730 kilometers long. Starting in early March, bamboo materials were collected. Construction began on March 10. According to the designated blockade line, the bamboo fence was built in one and a half months. The entire district was surrounded by fences to implement the work of ensuring that good citizens who abide by the law can resume a life of peace and contentment.</p>
<p>In order to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking in and out and to control the smuggling of materials, 57 checkpoints were established along the blockade line, with 550 workers assigned. To carry out the inspection work.</p>
<p>Within the rural pacification area, all administrative and educational work must be started from scratch. From the beginning of rural pacification to the completion of the predetermined goals, there are two aspects of work to be done within the six-month period: negative and positive. Specifically speaking, military sweeps, establishing blockade lines, compiling and checking Baojia, registering self-renewal households, and reporting undesirable elements are all part of the negative aspect. Training township and town chiefs, training Baojia chiefs, establishing self-defense corps, organizing guard work, and considering people's livelihoods and adjusting the economy are all part of the positive aspect. According to officials in charge, the above-mentioned tasks have generally reached the point of completion.</p>
<p>The purpose of rural pacification is to enable people to live and work in peace, and to enable people within the district to defend, govern, and support themselves. 7,965 workers were mobilized to complete various scheduled tasks within the limited six-month period. The perseverance of the presiding authorities and the diligence of the workers are commendable.</p>
<p>Tour of Jianbi</p>
<p>Jianbi Town and Dantu Township belong to the fourth district of Zhenjiang County. We once set out to visit. Along the way, villages and towns had self-defense guards watching the main roads, implementing the "three selfs" rural pacification policy. Jianbi is a small, insignificant town with more than 50 stores. Restaurants and taverns occupy about 10 of them. Fish, meat, and vegetables are piled up inside the stores, and there are many diners. This reflects the relatively stable life of the people in the town. Rice stores are piled high with white rice, selling for about 120 yuan per dan, and pork sells for 36 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>The Jianbi Town Self-Defense Guards have X hundred members, all of whom have received military training. During the inspection, their marching, drills, and basic military movements were quite proficient. At the same time, we also saw a security drill. From the discovery of bandits to the routing of bandits, various actions in between were swift, brave, and agile. Coordinated with the local garrison and the local police brigade, their advances, retreats, and maneuvers were vividly realistic.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Spirit</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang City, we participated in two major inspections of the First District Self-Defense Corps, with a total of three squadrons. Their uniforms were neat, and their marching was orderly. The self-defense guards each have their own occupations, and they enthusiastically receive training in their spare time, acquiring basic military knowledge to protect their homeland. Therefore, we know that the self-defense capabilities of the rural pacification area are quite strong.</p>
<p>Establishing security and improving people's livelihoods are the two major goals of rural pacification. In terms of security, we have gained some understanding, which is that people in the rural pacification area can now live in peace and no longer suffer from the harassment of bandits as before. Regarding the work of improving people's livelihoods, according to the report from the county government officials in charge, they have started by abolishing exorbitant taxes and levies. In the past six months, they have abolished the Fuxing Tax, the Jiangmian Tax, and the farmland donations, etc., in addition to the national tax. No local taxes and levies have been added. In addition, suppressing commodity prices, assisting in silkworm rearing, and planning to increase production are all implemented to improve people's livelihoods, guiding them to bravely advance on the road to "self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>Rural Pacification Cadres</p>
<p>The actual person in charge of rural pacification is Director Yuan Xueyi, and the Deputy Director and Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Xiu Ming, are both full of vigor. Their performances are youthful, lively, and decisive. This group of officials led nearly 8,000 workers, fought hard for half a year, cleared out the remnants of the Communist army, and enabled the people of Zhenjiang to embark on the road to rebirth.</p>
<p>Social Atmosphere</p>
<p>Zhenjiang City is a major station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Because it is close to Nanjing and Shanghai, the social atmosphere is also similar to that of Nanjing and Shanghai. It is necessary for the authorities in charge to quickly rectify it.</p>
<p>The Dadong Ou Arena is an entertainment venue that imitates the Gaole Arena in Shanghai. Ordering plays, female singers sitting with guests is like Shanghai and Nanjing. Here, we can see generous guests who are not stingy with spending thousands of gold coins. It is said that there are also guests who call from home to order plays, ordering female singers to go to their residences to serve them. Among these guests, it is also heard that some are civil servants. "Diligence and thrift" is what the chairman often instructs the people, and "thrift to cultivate integrity" is the code of conduct for political personnel. We only hope that what we have heard is not true. In the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals' criticism of the virtuous, we hope that civil servants will quickly change their ways if they are in the wrong.</p>

<h3>On Starting a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>— Ma Zhonglai</p>
<p>I am a teacher, having taught at universities and secondary schools for over ten years. It's not that I'm tired of it; I long ago chose education as my lifelong career, and I have a great interest in it. However, in recent years, I often feel troubled and pained. Last semester, I taught thirty-four hours a week at two universities, and my monthly income was still less than two thousand yuan, while my expenses were more than three thousand. I was constantly strapped for cash and had to budget carefully. Every time I heard about a price increase, I was alarmed. If my wife became ill, I would be even more at a loss. I thought to myself, I am educating other people's children and cultivating talents for the nation, lecturing and gesturing all day long, but the compensation I receive is not even as good as that of a rickshaw puller. This society is too unfair! The threat to my livelihood has disturbed my mind, and the worry about food and clothing has exhausted my spirit. This has further affected my work. To worry about making a living, my mind is not focused; with too many classes to teach, there is not enough time. I deeply feel that the effect of my work is far from what it used to be. I am aware of the great responsibility I bear and the importance of the work I do, but I cannot do it wholeheartedly, even though I have tried my best. The anxiety felt by a person who carries the heavy burden of life every day, a person who is constantly threatened by the pressures of life, a person who is dissatisfied with his own work, a person who holds the guilt of "misleading the students," is something that others can never understand. I believe that this anxiety and pain are felt by every teacher in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Jiang Shoutong suggested establishing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, which is indeed a good way to solve some of the financial difficulties of teachers and staff. I sincerely hope it will be realized soon. "It's hard to twist a rope from sand at the beginning." The number of teachers and staff in Shanghai, including those in universities and primary and secondary schools, is not small. Usually, they have no organization and are not connected. Now, to have a consumer cooperative is like twisting a rope from sand, not an easy task. Moreover, many teachers are influenced by traditional ideas and inherited habits, ashamed to talk about profit, content with simple living, or indifferent, watching for success or failure. School authorities often do not think about the future of education and the livelihood of teachers, and are even more afraid of complications that could harm their own interests, or they procrastinate or obstruct and sabotage. In order to quickly establish a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, I have the following suggestions: First, a few enthusiastic teachers should organize a temporary preparatory meeting to draft a plan. On the one hand, advertise to teachers and staff in Shanghai, sending out letters for registration, specifying in the registration letter the name, school, position or course taught, home address, family size, and number of shares subscribed. On the other hand, request assistance from people in the community and negotiate for the allocation of necessary items. When there is considerable progress, convene a general meeting of members, elect responsible staff, and discuss the implementation plan. The plan should be based on the number of people who join and the circumstances, either by school or by district. The Shen Bao on the 24th had the collective opinions of fifteen teachers, or perhaps those few should be asked to prepare the work, not declining the responsibility, hoping they won't be too modest.</p>
<p>I also have a point to make, which is that even if a consumer cooperative is established, it may not solve the financial difficulties of teachers. Because there are many things that still need to be bought from retail stores. The gap between teachers' salaries and prices is really too far. Let me make a comparison: before the war, university salaries were two and a half to three yuan per hour, and the cost of living was 120 yuan per month; last semester, salaries were twelve to fifteen yuan per hour, and the cost of living was more than three thousand yuan per month. Salaries have increased fivefold, the cost of living has increased thirtyfold, and prices have increased, to say the least, a hundredfold. Limited clothes have already been worn out, and meager savings have already been used up. Exhausted, unable to continue, is the situation teachers are in now. Unable to live in peace, how can they enjoy their work? The decline in educational efficiency and the decline in students' levels are undeniable facts, phenomena that we are extremely heartbroken about. The impact is not yet visible, but in the future, it will have serious consequences, which is so dangerous for the country and the nation. But what can we do! As the Shen Bao editorial on the 25th said: "To improve education and increase efficiency, the most basic thing is to start with improving the lives of teachers and increasing the salaries of teachers." I think teachers' salaries should be increased at least twenty times compared to before the war. Increasing teachers' salaries will inevitably lead to an increase in students' tuition fees, which may be criticized. Indeed, poor parents are already unable to afford their children's education, but there are also students who spend lavishly, wasting endlessly. A pair of leather shoes, a suit, or a few fewer trips to the theater, dance hall, or restaurant would be enough to pay for a semester's tuition with money to spare. Even if tuition is increased to 1,500 yuan, it is only thirty times what it was before the war. In the past, a journey that cost a dime by rickshaw now probably costs no less than five yuan. I think tuition can be increased as much as possible, but the number of free places for poor students must be increased, and scholarships should be given to students with outstanding achievements, because poor families cannot afford to study, not only because they cannot afford the tuition, but also because the daily expenses of clothing, food, and books far exceed the tuition. I hope that school authorities will seriously consider this point when deciding on teachers' salaries and students' tuition fees.</p>
<p>To lay the foundation for the country, to cultivate the strength for recovery, and to improve educational efficiency and stabilize the lives of teachers, please school authorities not to neglect the big picture for the sake of small gains; please people in the community to give sympathy and understanding; please all teachers not to become criminals of education for the sake of noble empty names, and rise up to discuss. Let us all work hard to improve education for the country and the nation!</p>
<p>Eliminating Opium and Gambling</p>
<h3>Advocating New Entertainment for the People</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>In recent years, tens of millions of people have lost their homes and property or even their lives due to opium and gambling. After the takeover of the two concessions, the municipal government is very determined to ban opium and gambling in the city and will soon order their closure. Dance halls and bars will also be restricted and closed early. This is an exciting sign. From now on, the dark side of Shanghai will be thoroughly cleaned up, replaced with a new look, and the people's entertainment will be guided to the right path. It is hoped that all sectors will actively promote various new entertainment activities to create new citizens with healthy bodies and minds. It is also hoped that the original site of the dance hall will be converted into a public gym, a public entertainment hall, etc., where various facilities are added and provided to the public for free entertainment.</p>
<h3>Zhou Bichu's Charity Oil Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Oil painting master Zhou Bichu,</p>
<p>In response to the request of fellow villagers, has exhibited more than a hundred of his masterpieces at the Overseas Chinese Club in Maurice Village, 30 Chongqing Road, which will be open to the public for three days starting on the 27th of this month, and will hold a charity sale for three days. The proceeds will be used to help the families of overseas Chinese in Xiamen and Gulangyu. People from all walks of life have been enthusiastic to visit and purchase. However, the exhibition period is too short. The fellow villagers have re-negotiated with Zhou Bichu and agreed to extend the exhibition for another three days until September 1st. The time is from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Charity School</p>
<p>The Qingxin Public Charity School's autumn class is scheduled to start on September 10th. Registration starts today. Students from poor families with excellent character are welcome to be introduced to the school for registration. Tuition is free, and book fees are given as appropriate. Address: 2nd Floor, Women's Bank, Baoanfang, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Lectures</p>
<p>The China Confucian Society will hold a "Confucianism Lecture" today from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Mr. Sun Xiangzhong will be invited to speak on "The Doctrine of the Mean," and Mr. Yang Zhongyi will speak on "The Great Learning." All are welcome to attend (Address: Chong Sheng Hall, 3rd Floor, 954 Edward Road).</p>
<p>Lost and Found</p>
<p>A pickpocket was caught at the Jiangxi Road tram station, and a watch was found. It was sent to your newspaper for claiming. If no one claims it, the watch will be donated to the student aid fund. (Wei Mingde)</p>
<p>A Shanghai County practice certificate of Tian Dan was picked up by a member of our local self-defense corps on Nanjing Road. The owner should bring a guarantor to claim it at No. 12, Lane 146, Nanjing Road within one week.</p>
