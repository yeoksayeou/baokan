<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論收買面紗棉布</h3>
<p>自從政府公布收買棉紗棉布命令以後，向來富於敏感性的本市市塲中，不無發生紳經過敏的揣測與庸人自擾的流言。我們以人民立塲，前已論列，一方面盼望政府切實執行，並對收買以後的合理配給，從早實踐。一方面向紗布業主進言，應放遠目光，顧全大衆利益，接受政府命令。誠以此事關繫國計民生綦重，願再加申論，以與國人共研討之。</p>
<p>當此世界戰爭漸入決戰之際，軸心國家與反軸心國家，莫不悉出人力物力以爭取勝利；人力方面，各國政府雖在環境困厄之中，仍力謀人民最低生活之安定，於是人民樂為國用。物力方面，各國政府施行物資統制政策，軍需民生集中支配，務使消費合理，於是物盡其用。所以，戰時任何國家，一致採用嚴格的物資統制方策，即如向稱自由主義經濟之美國，自前也絕對統制物資。他若重慶政權對於物資統制，在大東並戰爭以前即已實施，目前益趨嚴厲。對於銀行之管理，民生日用品之專賣，均在積極策進，一切物資均在嚴格統制之中。</p>
<p>我們目前的環境，是在奮力爭取最後勝利，國運前途，繫於千鈞一髮，對於決定戰爭勝利之物資，採取嚴格統制乃為必然之事，况且，我們久發高物價之痛苦，尤須採取統制方策，以期抑制。在此情勢之下，全體人民，尤其是工商界領導人士，必須認識時代，適應時代，一切經濟生活，固須顧及本身利益，但尤要顧及國家人民全體利益。私人發財之觀念，已屆末落時期。我們相信本市工商界領導人物，對於國家意識，公利觀念，必不薄弱，對於政府統制物資之施策，必能協贊推行，共謀完成。諺云：「覆巢之下，焉有完卵。」「皮之不存，毛將焉附」。必為工商界人十所引為炯戒的。</p>
<p>據傳本市棉紗存量，有六十萬包之多，個人業主中最富者擁有一萬包以上，按去年春季紗價不過每包四千元，最近黑市竟及五萬元。如此大數之存量，而在年餘期內，高漲至如此　度，其為不合理夫復何言。試問些六十萬包棉紗，在去年三月以前生產者，抑在最近期內生產者，一獲答案，即可瞭然於生產之眞實成本。去年五月以後，買進一紙棧單，即可面團團矣，其不合理又何如。</p>
<p>至言銀行之接受紗布棧單押款，是否適當？鉅額押款，又是否適當？當時均値愼重考慮。假定囤戶以最高黑市價向銀行押款，銀行縱以對折接受，是否與銀行業務有危險？是否有助長囤積居奇之風，刺激物便上漲之嫌，更値得撫躬反省。况銀行接受押款，不以其生產時期之成本為標準，而以黑市為標準，結果負危險資任，則又將何以自解？此種不合理之現象，試問除國家收買之外，尙有何法可以遏制？如聽其自然，勢必愈演愈烈，那末，紗布將非人民衣着用品，而一變為投機囤積之籌碼矣。因此，我們對於政府收買法令，在原則上絕對擁護，且必須向好的方面推想，不應向壞的方面推想。萬一政府於實施收買後，並不作合理配給，而有任何不良後果，那末，我們人民當然也不會默認，也就不能使人民擁護的。</p>
<p>更進一步說，政府這種措施，實嫌失之過晚，如果早於去年實施，決無如今日之嚴重的物價問題。於此，希望政府參酌實際情形考慮下列數點：</p>
<p>旣將收買紗布之職權，交付全國商業統制總會，即應賦與全權，不使牽掣，俾發揮最高效率。商統會方面應在紗布業領袖中聘請素孚資望，而品格高尙者主持其事。</p>
<p>在收買之際，一時或不實施配給，但布廠不應任令停頓，過渡時期，政府應妥為設法，繼續生產。</p>
<p>今後紗廠生產，政府尤應以收買價値為標準，顧及其成本，如原料之取給與價格之規定，應全力支援。不因此次收買而影響棉紗生產以至棉花生產。</p>
<p>因收買紗布而引起金融界之波動，政府為安定整個金融市塲應予以適切協助，由中央儲備銀行及銀行業聯合準備庫等調劑維持。</p>
<p>業主所有之紗布，雖已以黑市價向銀行取得押款，但責任幷不因此諉卸，銀行亦應向業主及保證人追償。</p>
<p>政府給付牧買價款，應顧及事實上之困難，縮短期限，或以公債支付，使可得以週轉。</p>
<p>最後，我們對此措施，盼望政府於貫澈政令之中，兼顧金融界實在情形，而為適切的支援·同時，我們始終認定紗布之外，糧食問題，於安定民生中，更為重要，無論如何。政府同時應速籌調節對策，付諸實施，民食幸甚，民生幸甚。</p>

<h3>羅邱會議　在奎貝克舉行　軍事政治均在討論之列英美蘇三國間摩擦未除</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據倫敦來電，英政府十二日公布：英首相邱吉爾及美總統羅斯福現決在加拿大之奎貝克舉行會談，但關於此項會談日期似尙未決定。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十二日中央社電據悉：英首相邱吉爾於十一日乘汽車離去奉貝克後，於十二日晨抵多倫多市，數分鐘後又轉赴某地，行踪極為秘密</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　奎貝克來訊：羅斯福總統現巳啓程赴奎貝克，以期與邱吉爾首相舉行會談。另據華盛頓報吿稱：羅斯福總統昨午智在白宮召集重慶。英國。荷蘭代表，舉行太平洋軍事會議。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　海通社訉：德國政治報吿稱：英相邱吉爾既抵奎貝克，證實邱吉爾與羅斯福又有第二次之會議，隨邱吉爾赴美者，又多為軍人，兩樓戰術專家蒙特巴人）·運輸大臣黎碩斯。暨邱吉爾家屬隨侍在側，外相艾登則不與焉。此次會談之內容，大約不外下列三點：　自兩樓戰略之立塲，研究戰事現狀；　對於義大利之政治的處置；　與蘇關係。猶憶羅邱二人甫於今年五月曾事晤談，不料時隔十週，又擬再事會面，在此短短之十週內，反軸心國已一誤再誤，雖在軍事上略有成就，然在政治上則亳無建樹可言，此次再度晤談，動機或即在此。</p>
<p>英加戰時內閣</p>
<p>舉行聯席會議</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　今日來自奎貝克之報吿稱：英首相邱吉爾及加拿大首相金根西頃發表文告謂，英戰事內閣與加拿大內閣之戰時委員會，昨夜在奎貝克舉行聯席會議。英戰時內閣由邱吉爾首相及樞密大臣安德遜代表出席，會議歷三小時之久，該文告又謂，聯席會議將於日後再度舉行。又英國與加拿大總參謀部之高級軍官，曾自淸晨即舉行無間斷之會談。</p>
<p>柏林方面推測</p>
<p>會談主要議題</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德當局對此次羅邱會談保守沉默，然消息方面觀測歐洲戰局現狀，對會談之動向相當重靦。據反軸心方面消息稱，此次會談之主要議題，或為計　反軸心軍進攻歐洲，最近即將與德國展開決戰。至於會談目的，則以左列見解最為有力，　過去反軸心軍之作戰計劃，大體為卡港會談斯決定者，地中海作戰較頃定計劃進展甚速，且法四斯帝制之崩漬全屬意外，同時蘇聯政府近於眞理報屢次要求英美於法國北岸方面結成大規模之第二戰綫，故反軸心軍須對此重大要求加以考慮，然蘇軍戰力無論人力物力均愈形低下，而反軸心陣營之軍需生產力及動員限度亦達頂點、軸心軍擬利用目前之趨勢，提前決戰時期，此或即此次會談之一目的。　會談中心議題首為對義方針與作戰，實無疑問，英美乘義國政變機會，曾對新政府要求無條件降服，但新政府毅然表明態度，拒絕此等要求，刻正協力德軍抗戰，蘇方之要求法國北岸結成第二戰綫，乃欲牽制反軸心軍進出於巴爾幹，然反軸心軍乃企圖於巴爾幹上陸，以爲分散德軍兵力，準備在法北岸實行上陸作戰之手段，如若直接在法北岸上陸，必蒙重大犧牲，反軸心軍對歐洲故不欲展開重大犧牲之作戰，一設若英美鑒於內外情勢，認有　速解決志必要，或亦將依蘇聯之張主，將攻勢重點移向法國方面。以上之問題須由英美蘇聯進行折衝，同時挪威代表亦有參加必要。又蘇聯未獲得英美瞭解，即於莫斯科設立德國政治委員會，並聲明合併波瀾及波羅的海三國，頗使英美不　。紐約泰　士報力唱更與蘇聯成立徹底諒解之必要，路透社亦唱同樣論調，由此觀之，可知英美關係相常複雜，此以上請示觀之，反軸心國或仍暫繼續其歐洲第一主義。</p>
<p>斯大林拒出席</p>
<p>一國同床異夢</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　英美兩國首腦雖曾邀請斯達林出席曾談，但斯達林不僅未允赴加拿大，且拒絕派遣代表出席羅邱會談。而次最近因東綫戰况稍見好轉，蘇聯之對英美態度，亦有相當不協力之表示，因此英美深感棘手，尤其美國爽論更紛紛指出蘇聯與英美間之協力不足，如華盛頓郵報曾於八月一日撰論謂，莫斯科與英美首都之聯絡薄弱，誠堪憂慮，蓋自蘇聯方面而言，對北非政權問題及對義政策等事，前均來接得任何通告，故其表示反感乃屬當然，總之，英美蘇三國間均固執巳見，實即為三國自取　亡。紐約泰晤士報於十日著論謂，過去蘇聯與反軸心各國間，缺少現實之瞭解，故須積極與蘇聯作進一步之聯絡。考蘇聯與英美兩國政府間未解決之懸案，大致有下列數點，　建立第羅的海之各國將來對於彼國國民之方策等。關於第二戰綫，蘇聯政府堅持除由多維爾海岸直接攻擊法國北海岸外，其他概不認之為第二戰綫，但英美兩國軍事當局則表示反對，認為進攻柏林不必僅限於多維爾海岸，則英美兩國政府以完全擊破德軍戰力為目標、但蘇聯政府表明反對。僅此一點雙方意見已經不同，故蘇聯現極為懷疑。英笑兩國政府，又將對共產主義抹取切斷交通政策，但一般美人之意見，以為英美與蘇聯刻下協力作戰，所謂切斷交通政策，現巳完全無用，美政府更無意利用波羅的漸之國家及波蘭以封銷蘇聯，由後方威迫蘇聯，並認美蘇兩國雖觀念不同，但資源均極豐富，故當前急務實為互相協力，向新的目標前進。</p>
<h3>斯大林接見　英美大使　傳艾登將訪蘇</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十二日中央社電　據莫斯科廣播稱，斯達林於昨後接見英大使寇爾，及美大使史丹萊，蘇外長莫洛托夫亦在座。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德外交部發表施密斯博士頃就斯達林不參加羅邱會談下表明意見如次：英美兩國新聞界近來曾屢次透露希望斯達林委員長參加會談之意，但斯達林此次仍未參加，英美兩國之失望極為顯然。蘇駐英美兩國大使現亦均在莫斯科，斯大林對英美政府意向之未予重視，由此亦可明瞭。又據莫斯科電稱：斯達林已提出波閱人柏林格上校為大將，此當為斯達林巳將視駐於蘇聯國內之波蘭軍師團視為蘇軍一部之證據，波蘭軍隊本在期望復興其祖國，而蘇政府則已將舊波領視為蘇領。又據謂英外相艾登行將訪問莫斯科，此行於外交上未必能有何成就。</p>
<h3>三軸心國　保持密切聯絡　日外相邀德義大使會談</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日重光外相於十二日下午五時半，邀請駐日德大使史塔瑪·義大使印德里於官邸。舉行三國共同會談，歷一小時之久，會談結果，三國對於貫澈共同作戰之協力關係。將各趨緊密。聞日德義三國此種共同會談，今後擬適應必要隨時舉行，俾三國在東京柏林及羅馬不斷保持緊密聯絡，以應付戰局而促進共同鬥爭。</p>
<h3>義的國新政動局向　德義協力更形強化　義國人民戰意昂奮</h3>
<p>義國政變以來，羅馬與　外各地問的國際電話聯絡，僅限於公用，期日新聞社柏林特派員守山於八月一日股法與羅馬特海員衣奈通話，獲悉萬分緊張的義大利動戀的詳情。該次還話內容，立即由柏林分局用國際電話於當夜報吿東京木社：</p>
<p>柏林：政變以來，業已一遍　羅馬的狀况如何？此間一般人對之均甚表關懷。</p>
<p>羅馬：人心漸趨穩定。伯戒嚴令尙末撤銷，一到晚上力時、到處有槍聲可聞，略感不育。新政府　這二一日來更加緊實施戒嚴令。</p>
<p>柏林：北義米蘭的情勢，似尙騷擾不靑</p>
<p>羅馬：北義的情形，此地不大淸楚，此次的政變，大概祗有第一天一般人因推測其以復得能勞而表示與實的狀態，之後在　四，五天事態即告穩定，我的的印不象流，血覺得命反巳法吿成斯功蒂。墨索里尼氏的照相及裏及官廳的牆壁中撤去，法西式的街頭的裝飾物已全部取　。</p>
<p>柏林：民衆的騷擾，乃是放逐法西獨裁政黨而收囘自由民權同時，一般人不也有着戰爭就此結束的感覺幅？</p>
<p>羅馬：這雖是一般人所希望的，但為現寶所不許·在政變的第一天的確可見到這種情緒。一般民衆的心理以為若墨素里尼下台，新政府登塲，則戰爭就要吿終，但這不過是民衆的錯覺。巴杜格里奧發出繼續戰爭並遵守約束的聲明，依國家　動員體制逐漸徵集軍士。英美方而亦對新政權表示不滿而加以攻擊，恫嚇，進攻四西里島軍總司令艾森霍華於昨日宣言再度開始轟炸義國本土，但實際上兩軍正在西西里島激戰，這種情形，使一般民衆認織義國尙在戰爭中，而民衆在這時也明白戰爭尙在繼續。如其在此時放手，則英美軍攻其南，德軍扼其北，所以現在的義國，為了打開國難，不能不挺身而戰。</p>
<p>柏林：巴杜格里奧政府與三國同盟的關係，與軸心的關係，自然希望其有積極而有力的言論，關於此點，新政府的意見如何？</p>
<p>羅馬：在戰事方酣之際，而從事以法西斯革命大工作的巴杜格里奧政府。到現在為止，似乎沒有工夫考慮到這一點。當然，與軸心的關係，巴杜格里奧政府最近將作重大的聲明與發表。</p>
<p>柏林：政變以來德國在義大利的派遣軍與義國國防軍兵士的合作，沒有甚麽變化嗎？</p>
<p>羅馬：德義協力的同仇敵愾之心。無寗說更為堅固，例如政變的第一日即有如次的段挿話。</p>
<p>常時在羅馬郊外的黑衫義勇軍，感覺到墨索里尼身邊的危險　擬開始進軍避馬，與義國防軍之間，即將發生衛突。在這十鈞一髮之際，德軍開到兩軍陣地之間，阻止兩軍接觸。又德國駐義空軍李希特霍芬部隊　集各兵士的零里捐款，積成一百十四萬三千零五十里拉德鉅額用以援助羅馬被矗炸的難民。</p>
<p>德義軸心的血盟關係，依然如昔的例子，不　一一枚舉。而四四里戰事中，德義二軍仍頑強抵抗。　方在這幾天攻勢稱緩，亦因見到政變以後兩國的協力强化緣故。</p>
<p>柏林：梵蒂國內敵國的暗中活蹤，中立國的活動，以及軸心陣綫的對策，沒有新的消息嗎？</p>
<p>羅馬：義國方經大政變之後，對梵蒂岡的動向，非常注意。教王對於新情勢的發展自然表示異常關心，連日召集教廷的國務卿，及其僚屬等熟心研究義國及國際情勢。在法西斯大評議會中扮演重要角色的格蘭第議長，亦曾與教王會見，有所商談，梵蒂罔中立國的外交官，以保加利亞大使為中心而團結起來，開始集團的活動。此可視為中立國希望脫滬戰爭重負的表現。</p>
<p>柏林：希特勒乘墨索里尼六十　辰之日經凱塞林元帥以「尼采全集」贈與墨氏麽墨氏現在大概在那裹呢？</p>
<p>羅馬：關於墨氏居處現有種糧說法。大概　在國王的庇護下。法西斯重要幹部，亦由國防軍及　察部隊戰密保護共生命。而阿比西尼亞戰爭以來的中堅份子及地方的法西斯指導者，亦由巴杜格里奧新政府潑出　集命令，陸續應召為義國國防軍。</p>
<p>共他約四百七十萬人法西黨員，自黨解散以來，應召而服役於軍務者甚多。法四斯的黨組織以外的原來的「李特里奧者少年團」約九百萬人，在「義大利靑年團同盟」新名義下，繼續存在着。</p>
<p>自前日起，新政府又以雜國全境的國有鐵道，私有鐵道，電報，電話，郵　關係的官吏，從業員置於軍得直屬下，任以軍職，例如郵政局長爲大尉，雇員爲少尉，備員為兵士，全部照軍隊的方式編組。新政府的方針，在戰爭告終後四個月內舉行國會議員總選舉。在立法行政確立之前，以軍政指導一切（翼：聯自八月三日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>卡科夫北郊　展開坦克大戰　德軍善用時間因素東綫消耗戰獲成功</h3>
<p>東錢消耗戰獲成功</p>
<p>飛瑞典京城十二日中央社電　卡科夫方面蘇軍於進抵該市北方郊外德軍守備綫後，常與德軍展開十日來朱曾有之坦克車戰，德軍之反攻極為熾烈，蘇軍經長時問之死戰，並承受極大犧牲，但無若何進展，德軍據住宅區以十字砲火猛擊蘇軍突擊部隊戰錢，至十一日下午殆仍無變化。同時企圖遮斷卡科夫後方之蘇軍，自貝爾哥勒特西方開始進攻，至十一日似已切斷卡科夫爽斯姆伊之鐵道，進抵卡市西北百公里之阿夫特伊爾加。路透社曾報道稱；卡科夫之德軍已開始撤退。又奧勒爾西方德蘇兩軍以凡合賈吉夫東方十一哩之阿勒庫塞夫加爲中心，在奧勒爾之白里安斯克間鐵道沿綫展開激戰，德軍仍織續抵抗，使蘇軍不能迂迥白里安斯克展開包圍作戰，僅於白里安斯克東方集結主力，繼續實行正面攻擊而已。英國軍事專家方面曾觀測蘇軍主力在進抵白里安斯克前，兵力有被耗盡之危險。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　著名軍事評論家狄特瑪中將於昨日廣播，檢討一般戰事局勢謂，軸心軍已獲得時間因素之特殊優勢，目前在東綫進行之戰事亦可視為消耗戰，德軍於過去兩年中在東綫佔有極為廣大之地區，且能採取守勢，為避免不必要之損失起見，亦能在數區撤退，蓋誰能着用時間因素者，即誰能獲取時間上之優勢，祚目異大規模之束綫夏季戰事中，德軍因時間勝利，故巳使敵人遭遇莫大之損失。</p>
<h3>英美船舶損失　上月達十二日</h3>

<p>柏林十三中央社電　德軍司令部十二日戰報稱：西西里島之軸心軍，依照預定計劃，退至巳縮短之橋頭堡陣地，敵軍企圖在該島北部沿海地損失慘重。又敵軍企圖在該島西北部之奧期在角（Cape　Orlando）登陸，被軸心軍在德機場助下擊退。並即皆　滅。</p>

<h3>滿洲國的金融新體制（一）</h3>
<p>確立國內自給</p>
<p>開發滿洲產業計劃，其目的在使典型的農業國滿洲發展為高度的重工業國，至一九四一年度，克服種種不利的客觀條件及計劃本身的缺陷，而完畢其第一次計劃。自去年度起，繼第一次計劃之後，繼續實施第二次計劃。本年度已想是第二年了。</p>
<p>關於本年三月末告終的第二次計劃第一年度的成續，將在卽將舉行的常會中發表，從各方面狀况推測起來，成績相當良好。</p>
<p>第一次計劃尙不脫全面的依存日本之性實，而第二次計劃的特微，則在資材，資金方面，儘可能的謀國內自給，以避免對日依存。日本正在傾注全力以完遂大東亞戰爭，為了對日本的戰力增强上有所實獻，滿洲國不僅在消極方面减輕其對日依存性，並且積極的謀增加鐵，煤，食糧等的對日輸出。因此，確立使資材，資金自給的體制是必要的。此在去年十二月八日大東亞戰爭一周年時所發表的滿洲國基本國策大綱中已加闡明。</p>
<p>國策大綱已加闡明</p>
<p>金融基本方策</p>
<p>滿洲國在資金的分野上是農業國，且對中國本部處於殖民地的地位，資本的蓄積，亳無可觀，縱令有之，亦為商業資本及高利貸資本，而動員於重工業方面的資金，必須長期固定且低利貸的，是以極為困難。因而金融新體制的確立，遂為當前的急務。國策基本大綱在其第四章經濟綱要第七項金融上，指明了滿洲國金融的趨向。</p>
<p>芟除阻害圓元等價主義的諸因素。</p>
<p>澈底動員及分配國內資金向生產部門，並抑制投機及向商業部門的國度投資，以謀吸收浮動　買力。</p>
<p>講求消化國債及獎勵儲蓄的各種積極化方策　培育並裏頓證券市塲及國內金融機關，並謀土著資本的活用。</p>
<p>中央銀行制度加以改　，強化其國家的機能。</p>
<p>上述五項中，第一項暫置勿論，其他四項，以其為滿洲金融界的重要問題，業已樹立具體的對策，開始實施。其次，關於以此為中心而漸次形成的滿洲金融界的戰時體制，我們未加以若干檢討。</p>
<p>上述第五項中關於改善中央銀行制度的問題，已由去年十月的新滿洲中央銀行法加以具體化。新滿洲中央銀行為發券銀行，同時並為使其擔負金融統制機關的任務起見，成與金融統制會的機能，資本金金額一千萬元，由政府出資，具特殊法人的地位，於去年十一月一日開始營業。</p>
<p>與此同時，普通銀行業務的整理問題，亦積極開展，由中央銀行着手整理。本年五月，中央銀行的首腦部因改組而更迭，原大藏省駐海外財務官西出勉氏被任為總裁，前奉天省畏徐紹鄉氏被任為副總數。確立了遂行新中央銀行法所賦與的機能之完普的體制。</p>
<p>儲蓄獎勵運動的展開</p>
<p>滿洲國國內資本的蓄積極為貧乏，是以第一次計副中所預定的大部分國內籌措的資金，均賴中央銀行收受政府公債，這出通貨以供給之。但用這種方法所籌措的資金，孕育着誘致惡性通貨膨脹的危機。數年來物價騰貴的趨勢，對滿洲官民與以警吿。尤以在空前大戰進行時期中，這種膨賬的傾向，不能不澈底加以排除。</p>
<p>在遭種情勢下，滿洲金融界成為最大的問題者，是抑制膨賬及動員土著資本。中央銀行接受滿洲國債，勢必造成增發國幣，增大市面上的購買力的結果。仰制　腹的先決條件即爲吸收這購買力。一九三九年以來，以協和會為中心而展開的獎勵國民儲蓄運動，其目的即在吸收購買力。一九三九年的目標預定為五億圓，而實際達六億三千人百萬圓。一九四〇年的目標額為八億圓，而實際達八億三千萬圓。一九四一　目標額為十一億圓，而實際達十一億一千萬元，進行殊稱順利。去年的目標額較前年增四億圓，而為十五億圓，但實際僅有十一億六千萬元，距目標不足三億四千萬圓。因此，滿洲國政府鑒於去年度的成績，經種種檢討的結果，擬定本年的目標額為十六億圓，而講求達到此目標的各種方法。</p>
<p>基於去年六月所公佈的國民儲蓄法，國民儲蓄會為推進獎勵儲蓄運動的中心，陸續在全滿各地設立，在本年大月初旬，金滿共計有國民儲蓄會四萬八千五百九十七，會員數百五十七萬七千九百三十二人</p>
<p>本年度儲蓄目標額十大億圓中，預定以五億圓消化於公債，十一億圓充生產擴充資金。為達到此目標額起見，由國民儲蓄中央實踐委員會規定各機關並各省的儲蓄比例額，各機閱中分銀行存款五億三千萬圓，公司公積金三億九千萬圓，郵政儲金一億七千八百萬圓；保險，彩票，三千萬圓。</p>
<p>促進消化公債</p>
<p>滿洲國的獎勵儲蓄運動，除去年度外，如上所述，似可說是成功的，但各種金融機關所吸收的資金，因利息的關係，欲動員於生產部門頗為困難，而欲把這筆資金來消化公債，更為因難。所以為增大滿洲對日本的貢獻，必須把用獎勵儲蓄運動所獲得的資金，導向生產部門方面，而以之消化公債。</p>
<p>為促過公價的消化起見，滿洲團政府自去年度起規定各機關的消化額而戀恿其購入。法年預定發行公債三億三千六百萬圓，其中一億五千萬圓分配於各機關。又據隨時資金統制法，自去年以來，實行強制各公司購買公債。自法年四月第二次計劃開始時起，至一九四七年三月第二次計劃結束時目，在此期間中，各公司在每營業年度的利益金中超過十分之一後，以純益百分之二十購買公債。</p>
<p>因此，滿洲國國內各普通銀行及商工金融合作社，為響應政府促進消化公債的企圖，自今春以來，積極的着手保有公司廣。</p>
<p>各種金融機關所收吸的資金，如欲以之動員於生產部門，首先必須减低金利，滿洲的普通銀行，利息額高，定期存款有高至年利五分至六分者。是以這些資金動員到生產部們，首須謀存款利率的减低。</p>
<p>一九四一年八月，在中央銀行幹旋下，網羅新京·奉天·哈爾濱·安東四都市的銀行，合作社及無限公司實施甲乙三種存款利率協定。繼於十月更在齊齊哈爾·佳木斯·牡丹江·圖們·延吉·龍井·吉林·四平鐵嶺·撫順。鞍山·營口·錦州十三都市實施利率協定。本年四月十五日，更實行調整金融機關的存放利率。實施利率協定的區域，除原來十七大都市外，再加二十八都市共計四十五都市。同時减低高利貸，定期存款的利率抑低至〇。八％。</p>
<p>爲適應一般利率水準的低落，滿洲國政府亦提高公債的發行價格而减低公債利率，關於商業票據的折扣，國債担保借欽，及短期透支等，中央銀行亦較前减低〇·〇〇五　，以圖債以外爲担保的減低〇·〇一％。如此，滿洲國的低利政策而更見澈底，土著資本向重工樂方面的動員及消化公債的誘導，在這裏途有飛躍的進展。</p>
<p>共同貸款的特別勘定</p>
<p>基於滿洲國統制經濟的進展，因土著資本之商業活動分野的狹隘化及開發資金的增加等種種原因，普通銀行一時陷於資金難於貸放的境地，於是在中央銀行幹旋之下，成立普通銀行對特殊公司的共同貸放。一九三八年十一月，三家銀行對滿洲農產公社共同貸款八十萬元。之後共同貸放途日趨發展，全滿普通銀行殆均參加這共同貸放團。本年五月二日的貸款出資金額共計四千百八十萬圓，共同貸款團對中央銀行的特別存欽五千七百六卞四萬四千圓。貸款者及金額知左：</p>
<p>這共同貸放制度，一元地　集中國內普通銀行商工金融合作社的剩餘資金，把短期存款當作長期資金來加以運用。滿洲國政府並中央銀行當局因欲以之利用於國策的資金需要方面起見，把現在的共同貸款制取消，另在中央銀行內設置獨立會計組織的共同貸款的特別勘定。於是共同貸款制遂愈見進展，今後的運營，頗堪注目。（翔：腳丫自號同）盟世界週報三八號）</p>

<h3>循環經濟　以棉製品交換農產物配給農產物鼓勵工業</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社會國府此次斷然實行收買滬市棉紗棉布，對國民生活之安定，國民經濟之復興，乃至大東亞經濟之建設，勢將因此而得早日完成，日本國內各報紙均熱烈加以評論，茲綜合譯錄其大意如次：</p>
<p>日方輿論</p>
<p>中國國民政府此次實施收買棉紗棉布，於是中國復興經濟安定民生等當前首要問題，巳開始第一步工作，此次國府之是項斯然措置，其目的乃在使囤積物資得　合理之配給，　使經濟活動漸　活潑，生產方而蓋為收買米麥農產物，故以棉製品洪給農民，藉謀收買　產物之圓滿，然後以農產物作適當配給，而使都市在工　之生產，得以復興，並保障重要鑛業之生產，繼以此產業生產品作收買農產之用，如此過程，循環不息，足使中國經濟力得有飛躍進展，同時即可安定民生，以加强推進國府之政治力，如此對於大東亞戰爭之完成中，自亦有更大之貢獻，抑就中國現狀而艱，欲期經濟復興，捨此以外，恐別無他途，故吾人於此望國府此次決斷之時，除積極予以協力外，更望國府傾其全力，澈底推進此次方針，且此種措置，苟萬一不能將收買之物資作有效使用，則中國經濟亦專將陷入極嚴重之危機，故關於作有效而滴當之使用，自必須十分愼重也。</p>

<h3>滬西警局長　潘達廣播</h3>
<p>市宣傳處為慶祝租界收回，特與上海電合聯絡舉辦廣播，昨（十二）日晚為滬四警察局潘局長廣播，茲節錄大意如後：</p>
<p>今後上海全市已都在我國政府營理之下，一切行政，均趨統一，種種設施，自有一番改進。鄙人以為在各種改進中最主要的，就是　政。因為第一，警察是各種行政設施的協助者，第二，警察　和民衆最接近的官吏，所以欲謀上海的繁榮安樂、首在注意警政的設施，和建設雄厚的警力，公共租界的警政，自經友邦日本着手改善，盜案日見减少，治安業已確立，此後的具體問題，鄙人所希望解決的，第一是取締違法商人，第二是嚴禁　警包庇奸宄，第二努力協助救濟事業，第四是設立警政研究機關，現在上海　政旣經統一，原有滬西警政機　，自然有所更改，水人辦理　西警政戰務、幷因此告一結束，任內幸　上級長官，隨時指示友邦人士熱誠協助，地方治安，得以漸漸改善·本人除自愧和抱歉外，幷對上級長官，友邦人士，滬西民衆　示至誠的感謝。</p>

<h3>交還租界及收買紗布後之　思想獨立與經濟獨立　廣田報道課長談話</h3>
<p>日大使館上海事務所廣田報道部課長，於昨（十二）日下午六時，在百老匯大樓t見記者國，就交還租界及收買紗布之意義與今後之　　　設發表談話如次：八月一日交還租界後，在中國之租界，全部已告交還，中國政治上的獨立，乃告完成，但此政治上的獨立，亦可謂為中國已自英美勢力之下脫出而告完全獨立，即半殖民地國家已發　至完全之獨立國，而此處所指獨立，係對政治獨立而言，但為求眞正之獨立，必須更謀思想獨立及經濟獨立。</p>
<p>脫出英美思想</p>
<p>所謂思想的獨立，是中國人自英美性的思想脫出而囘復至眞正為中國人之東弡思想，又經濟獨立係指中國從過去半殖民地的經濟進展至獨立國家之經濟是也</p>
<p>租界之交　確為　民政府熱烈眞舉努力之成功，男一方面，亦為日本表示斷行政策之決意，由此英美對中國之帝國主義的侵略　力，已被逐出於中網領土，但此尚屬其第一步，為謀完成獨立之消極方面的指置，眞正的努力建設以今日為始，是故當務之急，第一在完成恩想及經濟之獨立，第二在求大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<p>在建設以大東亞共榮團及歐洲　為中心之新秩序時，為推行其政策，故對英美毅然作戰，苟作戰不獲勝利，則世界亦無新秩序，卽大東亞民族亦不能實現解故，易會之，如中日兩國在大東亞戰爭中不獲得最後騰利，則不能求中國政治經濟及思想獨立之完成，於茲日本已進入大東亞戰爭之最終階段，在國內確立必勝不敗之姿態，並對中國國民政府及民衆努力確立，如此次收買棉紗棉布之必勝經濟體制，表示敬意，此舉完全表現同甘共苦之眞證。</p>
<p>轉變經濟方策</p>
<p>另一方面必須考慮今後中國積極建設方面之中心點，在思想及經濟之獨立，並須充分認鐵中國之經濟歷久維持。</p>
<p>中國之半殖民地地位，英國　在澳洲　　　關帝國　　時，聲明以中國處在與即度澳洲同樣地位，列入金鎊共　圈。</p>
<p>在中國之鐵路船舶及工塲等，其一切資本，以金鎊金元之英美資本占大部份，致使中國之生產成為英美人之利益，現在中國雖已獲得政治上獨立，然其次更須獲得經濟之獨立，故中國應停止為英美資本全義而工作，須改革為中國人收獲之組織，否則不可　眞正之獨立國組織　在現在世界情　上，中國成為經濟獨立國家之要締·有以下三點：</p>
<p>第一，與大東亞經濟完全調和。</p>
<p>第二，以公益優先為原則，尤其以政治為先。</p>
<p>第三，將自由主載經濟轉變至統制經濟。</p>
<p>但在此經濟獨立之過程中，定有極大困苦，　　諸果實，須先　田；下種，施肥，然後可得收成。因未有未播種而能收成者，幸天賦東亞民族之力量與責任極大，可獲成功，必無疑義。</p>
<h3>日大使館限制　機器供給　明年需購機械須向組合提出</h3>
<p>昨據日文報載，關於一般民需重要機器之輸人，日大使館將採取生產與輸入及配給計劃，規定對於明年度機器之購入者，須向各所屬組合提出，再須經日大使館加以　重檢討，若於擴展生產無關老，則將予以限制。</p>

<h3>六期戶口糖　凖備發售</h3>
<p>軍配當局為調節上海食糖，設法由台　裝來鉅額食糖，撥交糖商合作營業處，辦理計口授糖及各業特種配給。上海社記者昨向關系方面探悉，上　存糖總額在二十萬包以上，足能長期維持正常需要。第六期戶口糖業已關始－準備，即將公告憑買證按口發售。至於各業特種配給之糖，　已依照以前核准之數，分別核發通知書，掉　購　證。</p>

<h3>簡易保險局設　各區業務所</h3>
<p>社會簡易保險局，近鑒於本市各H廠參加强制勞　保險已逾半數以上，為謀今後業務便利起見　特在本市各主要地區設置業務所。除閘北滬東兩處業務，暫由該局直接辦理外，第一區內將設置第一業務所，第八區內將設置第二業務所，第七區內將設置第三業務所，浦東第五第六　區內將設置第四業務所，日內即行分　成立，至各業務所主任人選，亦已內定。</p>
<h3>鹽務局偵查　擅抬鹽價</h3>
<p>查本市食鹽，近頗呈恐慌之象，皆因以訛傳誤，遂至有居奇抬價，非法當買之事，自經鹽政當局嚴飭裕華公司將庫存食鹽，大量配給於各鹽號各子鹽店各醬槽坊，市上官傳食鹽，已極充裕，且限令遵照牌價銷售，不得私　抬價。茲復探悉：松江區鹽務管理局，秉承鹽務　高當局及蘇浙皖鹽我管理總局，積極整頓，迭派幹員，分赴各售鹽商號，明查暗訪，有無陽奉陰違不　牌價出售情事，　有查獲，已送法院嚴辦。所有奉令稽查各員皆携帶公文，身佩證章，可向索閱，如有冒名假充，招搖撞　情事。</p>
<h3>取締香烟攤</h3>
<p>捲煙實施統制以來，由華中煙草公司統籌配給，旨在抑平售價，減低人民負擔，近日南市方面，竟有人異想天開，沿送設攤，專收高貴香煙，以供黑市銷納，市第二警察局以此種攤販，破壞推煙統制，昨特通令南市三警察分局，一體切實取締。</p>

<h3>急賑籃球功德圓滿　百樂門昨晚勝中北　女子表演白鵝勝華通一球</h3>
<p>急賑華北慈等籃球大要。中北與百樂門之南北會戰，經過三度之劇鬥，終於功德圓滿。而於昨晚雨絲風片中，宣告幕落。此次義戰情况，允稱熱烈，尤以昨晚颺尾尚在怒吼，大部分馬路水深沒膝之惡劣天氣下，中靑球房，依然客滿，是證觀衆擁護　賽之熱忱，胥出自衷心者也。昨晚女子表演揰曲，華通與白　，過程備　緊張，鏡頭精彩，掌聲雷動，結果白鵝以－球之先小勝華通。主力戰百樂門神旺氣足節節佔先，初擬將包松圓李組德兩員虎將出塲，惟因格於規例，朱能將未註册球員作戰，致入後替補乏人，以致僅戰賸三人，以寡敵衆，草草終塲，然結果百樂門仍以四十三比三十報捷，殊未免美中小疵耳。</p>
<p>昨晚義球拍賣，會展開空前之熱烈情況，最先無名氏大善士以二萬元承購，旋又捐出再拍。仍以五千元開價，一轉　即暴　至三萬元，結果由大中銀行總經理王爾　君得　。但王君艦於四週義賣空氣之熱烈，又再度用出，　付拍賣。結果在直綫上　　中，由夏士魁大着士以四萬元購去。</p>

<h3>鮑斯高慈幼會訪問記（四）　事業·生活·和期待</h3>
<p>鮑斯高慈幼會在上海，除了上述兩大事業之外，在南翔曾經辦有農業學校，招收鄉村曾苦子弟，　以科學耕種栽培，　成改善中國農業的幹部。滬戰　發後，昭於停頓。去年在江　（賣與路底）　辦農藝學院，由康益兼神父為院長，第一期在斯高學校學生中選取　苦而性情相近的學生二十名，敎以現代農學，主要課目為動物，植物化學，特別注重農藝栽培，驅除蟲害，改良方法，增進副產，以及農產品加工工業等，程度自小學五六年至初中，務期畢業後就可為農業改進運動的幹部。南翔農校，現在也已派員去籌備恢復了。</p>
<p>慈幼會所有事業，採取其特殊的敎育法，即是「預導法」，不侵犯學生的自由，不採用嚴厲　迫及過犯後的查罰方法。他們的敎法要　是：　一顆溫　慈愛的父心，　一個和顏悅色的態度，　一番循循善誘的訓誨，　一種不長勞頓的精神　一律細心周到的照料”他們使兒童活躍在不能犯過的環境衷，啓發他們心頭上道德的根苗，消滅他們不良的言行習慣，「慶禮院」，更為別級，專於星期及假　，招待校外各種貧苦兒童，　他們來校游戲，運動，談話及聽敎，各任其性之所好誘發其求學向上之心。對於已離校的學生，則組織「舊學員會」，使彼此團結互助，同學均有昆仲的情義，且常與母校來往，得到精神上的幫助。（未完）</p>

<p>上海的改組，問題重重，而最重要的，則是以上海為中心的物價　貴問題6對此，當同雖已公布了種種法令，實施種種限制，但物價的上騰，依然未見停止，且從最近的悄形肴來有更　騰漲的危險。原來上海物價騰貴的原因，從物的方面說來，因輸人杜絕，生產停滯而致物資不足，物資流通不圓滑等，從貨幣方面說來，因通貨的收囘困難，投　激增，貸放鬆沒等，這物資與通貨的不均衡，成為物價騰貴的原因。當局對於這些問題，雖已請求了許多對策涌但迄無效果可言·其故何在，値得加以考慮。現在上海物價　貴的特質。乃是雖有物而物價仍趨騰貴的這一點。上海物資存有相當數量，這是事實，但這些物資不在市塲上而在市塲外，即在流通過程之外。在市塲之外者即所謂囤積搜購，是以囤積就是物價　貴的主因，據中日交歡使節團團員吉田政治氏的報告，（文見八月八·九日本報）物價騰貴的原因，在於經濟原則之外的民衆心理。那支配民衆心理的是中國民衆對於世界戰局的觀測，以及敵方所施的經濟陰謀二者。對於物價騰貴之經濟上的原因，現方開始實施各種對策，將來自然還當加以强化，同時，吉田氏所指出的經濟以外的原因，亦應加以注意與警戒，諸求適當的對策，這是目前改組上海的中心問題，在物價對策上，決不應予以忽視。（翔：轉譯自八月卞二日大陸新報所載讀賣報知社論）</p>
<h3>財部限合夥錢莊　遵期依法改組</h3>
<p>財政部訓令錢業同業公會云：查關於已經開業之合夥組織錢莊補行註册一事·前經本部核定·姑准限於一年內改為公司組織，再行駐册，倘逾期不改，應即依法勒令停業，並經通行各在案，上項補行註册期限，截至本年八月二十日屆滿，各合夥錢莊，遵章　來註册者固多，而意有觀望，未據申請到部者，仍復不少，此次本部修正有關金融機關資本數額各法規條文，係指提高已經核准註册及申請新設之金融機關資本而言，至合夥錢莊補行註册，自願先照舊案依限改組，俟核准註册後，如其資本不及新定限額，再行增資，方合手續，茲為免除上項合夥錢莊誤解起見，相應咨請查照，飭知務於八月＝十日以前，呈請補行註册，勿存觀望此令。</p>
<h3>一區經濟處嚴　厲執行限價</h3>

<h3>本市金融尙穩定　小銀行停業不確</h3>
<p>自國府於九日公布收買棉紗棉布暫行條例後，一般投機囤戶，大起恐慌，但金融情形，尚稱穩定，乃八月十二日某報載有「投機商臻於末路小銀行相繼倒閉」新聞一則，攄謂國府賓行價買棉紗棉布後，一般因紗布問題而致倒閉或停止付款之銀行，　有十餘家之多，記者以此事有關上海金融安危。特走訪本市銀行業同業公曾探詢眞情，承告該項　戰，殊非事實，查江浙企業銀行，因周轉不靈，　停收付，尚為上星期之事，近日其他銀行，均照常營業，絕無所謂相繼倒閉情事，事關金融全局，希一各界勿滋誤會云。</p>

<h3>挫折的價值</h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>在一般人的心目中。認為挫折是一種空勞心力，毫無所得的損失。　實這是不但錯誤，而且有害的估價，為甚麼呢？因為　　錯　的心印深印腦際，使很多人稍遇挫折便　為事情已到絕境沒有挽囘餘地，因之望而却步，喪失了再度奮鬥的勇氣。所以我們對　挫折的價　實有中行佔　的必要，我以為挫折　　會造成一部份不　否認的損失，但倘若你能：　　所以遭受挫折的原因虛心地詳細加以分析和檢討，便可以從中發中以前計劃錯誤的地方，使你能看淸楚在你面前的究竟是怎樣的一秤障碍物，於是在下一次的書試中，　可採用滴當的方法加以克服和避免了。</p>
<p>所以濟遇挫折並不是不幸，它是每一個成功者的試金石，眞正的不幸，是在你遭遇挫折後不去分析和檢討它所以失敗的原因，而獲得指示不你成功的南針。孫紀和愛油生，這二位衆所周知的大偉人，在他們成功之前，那一個不〞遭遇許多次的挫折，但他們所以能夠成就千古不杇的偉業，便在於能夠耐心找尋所以挫折的原因加以分析和檢討，並以此為教訓，而不再重復這　挫折。</p>

<h3>過失</h3>
<p>— 良月</p>
<p>凡人皆有「過失」；然面，知「過」能改老寥寥無發。</p>
<p>並且，人大都不覺察自已的「過失」；甚至別人勸告他，他也執迷不悟。</p>
<p>所謂：「知過能改，善莫大焉，」所謂：「當局者迷，旁觀者淸」，意即在此。</p>
<p>因此，人人有「過」，貴在能改，而若要改「過」，必須處心下氣接受別人正確的批評，方不　自陷于錯誤而不自覺，因循苟且，延誤終身，</p>
<h3>友情</h3>
<p>— 良印</p>
<p>校門外，上倉橋，黯然揮別淚、從此各自奔前程，天涯任飄零。芸窗下，共一堂，觀樂意融融，別時容易會時難，相逢在何年？至今念，當年事，好夢再難溫，醒來悵感失望時，吾心空悲憤。</p>
<h3>噩夢</h3>
<p>— 映芹</p>
<p>是一個夏天的晚上，已經九點鐘，十四歲的小英正在補她破爛的襪子，眼睛裏在淌着淚。</p>
<p>她一邊補　，一邊只是昏然的想睡覺．恍惚間不知是做夢，還是囘憶？她忽然囘復到二年前的境况，那時她是十二歲，這一天　在小脚踏車上；後而　養爸和媽。帶着糖果餅乾，向附近的花園裏十去！小英的臉上微笑着，爸和媽也是笑容滿面，稱贊着她的　敏，活潑，美麗。爸說道：「今天是慶祝小英的考　三名，希）小英以後還要進步，年年考第一名。」那時小英的嘴幾乎　到耳朶上去了。……</p>
<p>拍！小英　地從幻想中驚醒過來，她剛才揉眼睛時，又是「拍的一聲從小英的身體上發出來。使她感到一　　沐和　痛，原來她的後　正兇　地着　她，毫不容情的把鷄毛帶抽在她的身上。她只是發果着，不敢徜淚更不敢辯一聲……</p>
<p>「吊死鬼！你要死好好的死。電　這麼貴，兩塊錢一個字。你爸總說我又夜麻將，你却開着電燈在　　。明天倒馬桶來時爬不起，定倒在你嘴　，我是沒有空來管你這敗家精，我現在去又麻將。等會回來銀耳我是要吃的，橫堅我有了這許多貨色，不能帶到棺材裏去。快去　我煮，可別再燒然了，右甚麼事明天再同你算賬。」</p>
<p>她駡了一會，才餘怒未息的跑出去。</p>
<p>小英默默地忍受着實罵，把銀耳弄好後再從新囘到牀邊，萬分委曲的想起暴　的後母，更想起巳死了的媽，不禁悲從心來，誤水又很怏的淌下來（移酬助學）</p>

<h3>Re-discussing the Government's Purchase of Yarn and Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, there have been some oversensitive speculations by the gentry and self-inflicted disturbances by mediocre people in the usually sensitive local market. As representatives of the people, we have already discussed this matter before, hoping that the government will earnestly implement the policy and put into practice a reasonable allocation system after the purchase as soon as possible. At the same time, we urge the yarn and cloth owners to take a long-term view, consider the interests of the public, and accept the government's orders. Because this matter is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, we are willing to discuss it further with the people of the country.</p>
<p>At this time when the world war is gradually entering a decisive battle, the Axis powers and the anti-Axis powers are doing their best to use manpower and material resources to strive for victory. In terms of manpower, governments of all countries, even in difficult circumstances, are still striving to stabilize the people's minimum living standards, so that the people are happy to serve the country. In terms of material resources, governments of all countries are implementing material control policies, centralizing the allocation of military and civilian needs, and striving to make consumption reasonable, so that everything is put to its best use. Therefore, any country in wartime uniformly adopts strict material control policies. Even the United States, which has always been known for its liberal economy, absolutely controlled materials before. Moreover, the Chongqing government has implemented material control even before the Greater East Asia War, and it is becoming more and more strict. The management of banks and the monopoly of daily necessities are all being actively promoted, and all materials are under strict control.</p>
<p>Our current environment is one of striving for the final victory. The future of the nation hangs by a thread. It is inevitable to adopt strict control over materials that determine the victory of the war. Moreover, we have long suffered from high prices, and we must adopt control policies to curb them. Under this situation, all the people, especially the leaders of the business community, must recognize the times and adapt to the times. All economic life must take into account their own interests, but more importantly, the overall interests of the country and the people. The idea of private wealth has come to an end. We believe that the leaders of the business community in this city are not weak in their national consciousness and public interest concepts, and they will certainly support and promote the government's policies on material control and jointly seek to complete them. As the saying goes, "When the nest is overturned, are there any intact eggs?" "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair cling to?" This must be a bright warning for people in the business community.</p>
<p>It is said that the inventory of cotton yarn in this city is as much as 600,000 bales. The richest individual owner owns more than 10,000 bales. According to the yarn price last spring, it was only 4,000 yuan per bale, but recently the black market price has reached 50,000 yuan. Such a large inventory, and rising to such a degree in more than a year, is unreasonable. Let me ask, were these 600,000 bales of cotton yarn produced before March last year, or were they produced recently? Once the answer is obtained, the real cost of production will be clear. After May last year, buying a bill of lading was a profitable business. How unreasonable is that?</p>
<p>As for whether it is appropriate for banks to accept cotton yarn and cloth warehouse receipt mortgages, and whether it is appropriate to accept large mortgages, these were worth careful consideration at the time. Assuming that hoarders mortgage the bank with the highest black market price, even if the bank accepts it at half price, is there a risk to the bank's business? Is there a suspicion of helping hoarding and driving up prices, which is worth introspecting? Moreover, banks accept mortgages not based on the cost of production during that period, but based on the black market price. In the end, if they bear the risk, how will they explain themselves? In the face of such an unreasonable phenomenon, what other method can be used to curb it besides national purchase? If we let it go, it will inevitably intensify. Then, yarn and cloth will no longer be clothing items for the people, but will become chips for speculation and hoarding. Therefore, we absolutely support the government's purchase decree in principle, and we must think of it in a good way, not in a bad way. If the government does not make reasonable allocations after implementing the purchase, and there are any adverse consequences, then our people will certainly not remain silent, and we will not be able to get the support of the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this measure by the government is really too late. If it had been implemented earlier last year, there would be no such serious price problem as today. Here, I hope that the government will consider the following points in light of the actual situation:</p>
<p>Since the authority to purchase yarn and cloth has been handed over to the National Commercial Control Association, it should be given full authority without interference, so as to give full play to the highest efficiency. The Commercial Control Association should hire people with high reputation and noble character from among the leaders of the yarn and cloth industry to preside over the matter.</p>
<p>At the time of purchase, the allocation may not be implemented immediately, but cloth factories should not be allowed to stop. During the transition period, the government should properly find ways to continue production.</p>
<p>In the future, the government should take the purchase price as the standard for yarn factory production and take into account its costs. It should fully support the supply and price of raw materials. The cotton yarn production and even cotton production should not be affected by this purchase.</p>
<p>The government should provide appropriate assistance to stabilize the entire financial market due to the financial fluctuations caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth. The Central Reserve Bank and the banking industry's joint reserve should be used to regulate and maintain it.</p>
<p>Although the owners have obtained mortgages from the bank at the black market price for all the yarn and cloth, the responsibility cannot be shirked because of this. The bank should also seek compensation from the owners and guarantors.</p>
<p>The government should take into account the actual difficulties when paying the purchase price, shorten the time limit, or pay with public bonds, so that it can be circulated.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the government will take into account the actual situation of the financial community and provide appropriate support in implementing government orders. At the same time, we always believe that the food problem, in addition to yarn and cloth, is more important in stabilizing people's livelihood. In any case, the government should quickly plan and implement countermeasures to regulate it. The people's food is fortunate, and the people's livelihood is fortunate.</p>

<h3>Southwestern Pacific Front: Comprehensive War Results of Japanese Air Force; Enemy Ships Sustain Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: The Japanese naval air force has been actively engaged in attacking enemy air power, destroying enemy ships and boats, and searching for enemy activities in recent days. The war results obtained in recent days are recorded as follows: The Japanese naval air force raided Lenteba Island at noon on the 10th and engaged in combat with Bale-type (P-92) fighters, shooting down four of them. Two Japanese aircraft did not return to base. On the same day, the Japanese naval air force urgently attacked Nayaomea Island in the Ellis Islands, launching a fierce attack on a 1,000-ton transport ship and six landing boats anchored on the island, causing considerable damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. From the night of the 10th to the dawn of the 11th, the Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy positions in the Lais Bay area of Georgia Island, causing heavy damage. Five enemy torpedo boats were discovered sailing in the sea west of Kiso-U, south of Kolumbangala Island, and were immediately attacked, resulting in the sinking of one and the destruction of another.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Jinshan stated that the anti-Axis military headquarters in the southwestern Pacific announced today that the Japanese escort group raided Wut拉克乌 in southeastern New Guinea yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Lu Province Fiercely Attack Yu Xuezhong's Troops; Japanese Troops in Ji Province Achieve Significant War Results</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line in Shanxi Province: The elite units of the Japanese army, because the main force of Yu Xuezhong's army had infiltrated the western Lu area, began to attack on July 27, surrounding them near Chehu and launching a fierce attack on their main units, the 111th and 114th divisions, until July 30. The Chongqing army left 720 corpses and 260 were captured, and achieved great war results. The attack is still continuing. In this battle, most of the main force of Yu Xuezhong's army was either killed or captured, so the command system has fallen into chaos. Moreover, because Colonel Liu Hangong, the captain of the baggage train of the 111th Division, surrendered to the Japanese army, the blow was even more severe, it is said.</p>

However, the air defense system in the North Chishima area has been strengthened, and the morale to destroy the attacking enemy aircraft is extremely strong.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discusses Financial Policies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since taking office, the National Government has been working hard to complete the wartime system and has been making every effort to promote economic construction. The reporter believes that the authorities have been more actively taking various effective measures in the economic field recently, so he specially visited Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, yesterday. According to him, in order to bring the floating capital in Shanghai into the right track, so as to prevent ordinary profiteers from manipulating and hoarding in the future, which will affect the social economy and people's livelihood, the competent authorities have made meticulous plans. It is expected that it can be implemented soon. At that time, the floating capital can be transferred to the path of revitalizing the inland industry and commerce, and its benefits to wartime production increase will be considerable. Furthermore, at this extraordinary period, increasing production and saving consumption should go hand in hand. Therefore, encouraging national savings is also an urgent task. The National Economic Commission Council previously passed measures to encourage national savings. The Ministry of Finance is now actively planning to realize it as soon as possible, so as to contribute to the construction of the wartime economy and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>The Luo-Qiu Conference is Held in Quebec; Military and Political Issues are on the Agenda; Friction Between the Three Countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Has Not Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the British government announced on the 12th: British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt have now decided to hold talks in Quebec, Canada, but the date of this meeting does not seem to have been decided yet.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 12th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that British Prime Minister Churchill left Fengbeike by car on the 11th and arrived in Toronto in the morning of the 12th. A few minutes later, he transferred to another location, his whereabouts being extremely secret.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Quebec stated that President Roosevelt has now set off for Quebec to hold talks with Prime Minister Churchill. Another report from Washington stated that President Roosevelt convened representatives from Chongqing, Britain, and the Netherlands at the White House yesterday afternoon to hold a Pacific military conference.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Haitong Agency: German political reports stated that British Prime Minister Churchill has arrived in Quebec, confirming the second meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt. Many military personnel followed Churchill to the United States, including two tactical experts (Montba People), Minister of Transportation Lisors, and Churchill's family members, while Foreign Minister Eden did not participate. The content of this meeting is roughly limited to the following three points: Studying the current war situation from the tactical standpoint of the two buildings; The political handling of Italy; Relations with the Soviet Union. It is recalled that Luo and Qiu had just met in May this year. Unexpectedly, after a gap of ten weeks, they planned to meet again. In these short ten weeks, the anti-Axis countries have made repeated mistakes. Although they have achieved slight military success, they have made no political achievements. The motivation for this second meeting may lie in this.</p>
<p>The British and Canadian Wartime Cabinets Held a Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A report from Quebec today stated that British Prime Minister Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King Kinsey issued a statement stating that the British War Cabinet and the Wartime Committee of the Canadian Cabinet held a joint meeting in Quebec last night. The British War Cabinet was represented by Prime Minister Churchill and Privy Councilor Anderson. The meeting lasted for three hours. The statement also stated that the joint meeting will be held again in the future. In addition, senior officers of the British and Canadian General Staffs held uninterrupted talks from early morning.</p>
<p>Berlin's Speculation on the Main Topics of the Talks</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities maintained silence on the Luo-Qiu meeting, but news sources are paying considerable attention to the trends of the meeting in light of the current state of the European war. According to anti-Axis sources, the main topics of the meeting may be the plan for the anti-Axis forces to attack Europe, and a decisive battle with Germany will soon begin. As for the purpose of the meeting, the following view is the most powerful: The past operational plans of the anti-Axis forces were largely decided by the Cartagena Conference. The Mediterranean operation has progressed faster than the established plan, and the collapse of the fascist system is completely unexpected. At the same time, the Soviet government has repeatedly demanded in Pravda that Britain and the United States form a large-scale second front on the northern coast of France, so the anti-Axis forces must consider this major demand. However, the Soviet military power, whether in terms of manpower or material resources, is becoming increasingly lower, and the anti-Axis camp's military production capacity and mobilization limit have also reached their peak. The Axis forces intend to take advantage of the current trend to advance the time of the decisive battle. This may be one of the purposes of this meeting. There is no doubt that the central issues of the meeting are the policy and operations against Italy. Taking advantage of the Italian coup, Britain and the United States demanded unconditional surrender from the new government, but the new government resolutely stated its position and refused such demands, and is now cooperating with the German army to resist. The Soviet Union's request for a second front to be formed on the northern coast of France is to contain the anti-Axis forces from entering the Balkans. However, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to land in the Balkans as a means of dispersing the German forces and preparing for landing operations on the northern coast of France. If they land directly on the northern coast of France, they will suffer heavy casualties. The anti-Axis forces do not want to launch major casualty operations in Europe. If Britain and the United States, in light of internal and external circumstances, believe that it is necessary to resolve the situation quickly, they may also follow the Soviet Union's proposition and shift the focus of their offensive to the French side. The above issues must be discussed between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Norwegian representatives also need to participate. Furthermore, the Soviet Union established a German political committee in Moscow without obtaining the understanding of Britain and the United States, and declared the merger of Poland and the three Baltic countries, which made Britain and the United States quite unhappy. The New York Times strongly advocated the need for a more thorough understanding with the Soviet Union, and Reuters also echoed this view. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between Britain and the United States is quite complicated. In view of the above, the anti-Axis countries may still temporarily continue their European first doctrine.</p>
<p>Stalin Refuses to Attend; One Bed, Different Dreams</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Although the heads of Britain and the United States invited Stalin to attend the talks, Stalin not only refused to go to Canada, but also refused to send representatives to attend the Luo-Qiu meeting. Recently, because the war situation on the Eastern Front has slightly improved, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain and the United States has also shown considerable lack of cooperation. Therefore, Britain and the United States feel deeply troubled. In particular, American public opinion has repeatedly pointed out the lack of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. For example, the Washington Post wrote on August 1 that the weak contact between Moscow and the capitals of Britain and the United States is worrying. Because, from the Soviet Union's point of view, it had not received any notification on issues such as the North African regime and the policy towards Italy, so it was only natural for it to express its dissatisfaction. In short, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all sticking to their own opinions, which is actually a self-inflicted disaster. The New York Times wrote on the 10th that in the past, there was a lack of realistic understanding between the Soviet Union and the anti-Axis countries, so it is necessary to actively make further contact with the Soviet Union. The unsolved cases between the Soviet Union and the governments of Britain and the United States are roughly as follows: The establishment of the various countries on the Baltic Sea and the future policies towards their citizens. Regarding the second front, the Soviet government insisted that it would not recognize anything other than a direct attack on the northern coast of France from the Dover coast as the second front. However, the military authorities of Britain and the United States expressed their opposition, believing that it is not necessary to limit the attack on Berlin to the Dover coast. The governments of Britain and the United States aim to completely defeat the German military power, but the Soviet government has stated its opposition. The Soviet Union is now extremely suspicious simply because of this difference of opinion. The British and American governments are also taking a traffic-cutting policy against communism, but the general American opinion is that Britain and the United States are now cooperating in the war, and the so-called traffic-cutting policy is now completely useless. The US government has no intention of using the Baltic countries and Poland to seal off the Soviet Union from the rear, and believes that although the US and the Soviet Union have different ideas, both have abundant resources, so the urgent task at present is to cooperate with each other and move forward towards new goals.</p>
<h3>Stalin Meets British and American Ambassadors; It is Rumored that Eden Will Visit the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio, Stalin met with British Ambassador Kerr and US Ambassador Stanley yesterday. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry announced that Dr. Schmidt recently expressed his opinion on Stalin's failure to participate in the Luo-Qiu meeting as follows: The British and American media have recently repeatedly revealed their hope that Chairman Stalin would participate in the meeting, but Stalin still did not participate this time, and the disappointment of Britain and the United States is extremely obvious. The Soviet ambassadors to Britain and the United States are now all in Moscow, and Stalin's failure to attach importance to the intentions of the British and American governments can also be clearly understood from this. According to a Moscow dispatch, Stalin has promoted Colonel Böllinger to general, which is probably evidence that Stalin has regarded the Polish military division stationed in the Soviet Union as part of the Soviet army. The Polish army originally expected to restore its motherland, but the Soviet government has regarded the old Polish territory as Soviet territory. It is also said that British Foreign Minister Eden will visit Moscow, but this trip may not have any diplomatic achievements.</p>
<h3>The Three Axis Powers Maintain Close Contact; Japanese Foreign Minister Invites German and Italian Ambassadors to Meet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu invited German Ambassador Stahmer and Italian Ambassador Andri to his official residence at 5:30 pm on the 12th to hold a three-nation joint meeting, which lasted for an hour. As a result of the meeting, the three countries will further tighten their cooperative relations in implementing joint operations. It is heard that the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy intend to hold such joint meetings at any time as necessary in the future, so that the three countries can continuously maintain close contact in Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome to cope with the war situation and promote joint struggles.</p>
<h3>The Direction of New Political Developments in Italy: German-Italian Cooperation is Further Strengthened; Italian People's Fighting Spirit is Aroused</h3>
<p>Since the Italian coup, international telephone communication between Rome and other places has been limited to public use. Mr. Moriyama, the Berlin correspondent of the Jiji News Agency, spoke with Mr. Enai, a Rome-based sailor, on August 1st, and learned the details of the extremely tense situation in Italy. The content of the call was immediately reported by the Berlin branch to the Tokyo headquarters via international telephone that night:</p>
<p>Berlin: How is the situation in Rome since the coup? People here are very concerned about it.</p>
<p>Rome: People's hearts are gradually stabilizing. Martial law has not yet been lifted. Gunshots can be heard everywhere after 10 p.m., which is a bit unsettling. The new government has tightened the enforcement of martial law in the past two days.</p>
<p>Berlin: The situation in Milan in northern Italy seems to be still turbulent.</p>
<p>Rome: The situation in northern Italy is not very clear here. In this coup, probably only on the first day did people show a state of speculation that it would be possible to restore Mussolini's labor, and then the situation stabilized in four or five days. My impression is not as bloody. It feels that the coup has been completed. Mussolini's photographs have been removed from the walls of offices and government buildings, and all fascist street decorations have been taken away.</p>
<p>Berlin: Is the public disturbance a result of the expulsion of the fascist dictatorship and the restoration of free civil rights, and at the same time, is there a general feeling that the war is about to end?</p>
<p>Rome: Although this is what people generally hope for, it is not allowed by reality. This kind of emotion was indeed visible on the first day of the coup. The general public thought that if Mussolini stepped down and the new government came to power, the war would end, but this was just a public illusion. Badoglio issued a statement continuing the war and abiding by the covenants, and gradually conscripted soldiers according to the national mobilization system. The British and Americans also expressed dissatisfaction with the new regime and attacked and intimidated it. General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in Sicily, declared yesterday that he would resume bombing the Italian mainland. However, in reality, the two armies are engaged in fierce battles in Sicily. This situation makes the general public realize that Italy is still at war, and the public also understands that the war is continuing at this time. If they let go at this time, the British and American forces would attack from the south, and the German forces would control the north. Therefore, Italy now has no choice but to stand up and fight in order to overcome the national crisis.</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the relationship between the Badoglio government and the Allied powers, and the relationship with the Axis powers, naturally, it is hoped that there will be positive and forceful statements. What are the new government's views on this?</p>
<p>Rome: The Badoglio government is engaged in the great task of the fascist revolution while the war is in full swing. Up to now, it does not seem to have time to consider this point. Of course, regarding the relationship with the Axis powers, the Badoglio government will soon make a major statement and announcement.</p>
<p>Berlin: Since the coup, has there been any change in the cooperation between the German troops stationed in Italy and the Italian defense forces?</p>
<p>Rome: The spirit of German-Italian cooperation against the common enemy is, needless to say, even more solid. For example, on the first day of the coup, there was the following anecdote.</p>
<p>At that time, the Blackshirt volunteers in the suburbs of Rome, feeling the danger around Mussolini, planned to march into Rome, and a conflict was about to occur between them and the Italian defense forces. At this critical moment, the German troops moved between the two armies and prevented them from making contact. In addition, the German Air Force unit in Italy, Richterthofen's unit, collected donations from all the soldiers, accumulating a huge sum of 1,143,050 lire to help the refugees in Rome who had been bombed.</p>
<p>Examples of the blood alliance relationship of the German-Italian Axis remaining as before are countless. In the Sicilian battle, the German and Italian armies still resist stubbornly. The slow pace of the Allied offensive in the past few days is also due to the strengthened cooperation between the two countries after the coup.</p>
<p>Berlin: Are there any new developments regarding the activities of enemy countries secretly in the Vatican, the activities of neutral countries, and countermeasures against the Axis front?</p>
<p>Rome: After the great coup in Italy, great attention is being paid to the movements of the Vatican. The Pope is naturally showing extraordinary concern for the development of the new situation, and has been summoning the Vatican's Secretary of State and his staff for days to study the Italian and international situations in depth. Speaker Grandi, who played an important role in the Fascist Grand Council, also met with the Pope and had discussions. Diplomats from neutral countries in the Vatican, centered on the Bulgarian ambassador, have united and begun group activities. This can be seen as an expression of the neutral countries' hope to get rid of the heavy burden of the war.</p>
<p>Berlin: Did Hitler present Mussolini with "The Complete Works of Nietzsche" through Marshal Kesselring on Mussolini's 60th birthday? Where is Mussolini now?</p>
<p>Rome: There are various theories about Mussolini's whereabouts. He is probably under the protection of the King. Important fascist cadres are also being closely protected by the National Defense Forces and the police force to safeguard their lives. The core members and local fascist leaders since the Abyssinian War have also been called up by the Badoglio new government and are successively being drafted into the Italian defense forces.</p>
<p>About 4.7 million Fascist party members have been drafted into military service since the dissolution of the party. The original "Littorio Youth Corps," with about 9 million members, continues to exist under the new name of the "Italian Youth League Alliance."</p>
<p>From the previous day, the new government has also placed officials and employees related to national railways, private railways, telegraphs, telephones, and postal services throughout the country under the direct control of the military, assigning them military ranks, such as postmasters as captains, employees as lieutenants, and staff as soldiers, all organized in the manner of the military. The new government's policy is to hold general elections for members of parliament within four months after the end of the war. Before the establishment of the legislative and executive branches, military administration will guide everything. (Wing: Linked from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on August 3)</p>
<h3>Tank War Unfolds in the Northern Suburbs of Kharkov; German Army Successfully Exploits Time Factor, Attrition Warfare on Eastern Front Proves Successful</h3>
<p>Eastern Front Attrition Warfare Proves Successful</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 12th. Soviet forces in the Kharkov area, after reaching the German defense line in the northern suburbs of the city, have been engaged in tank battles with the German army for the past ten days, a scale unseen before. The German counterattacks have been extremely fierce. The Soviet army has fought fiercely for a long time and suffered great sacrifices, but has made no progress. The German army used crossfire from residential areas to fiercely attack the Soviet assault forces' front line, and as of the afternoon of the 11th, there was almost no change. At the same time, the Soviet army, attempting to cut off Kharkov's rear, launched an attack from the west of Belgorod. As of the 11th, it appeared to have cut off the Kharkov-Sumy railway and reached Akhtyrka, 100 kilometers northwest of Kharkov. Reuters reported that the German army in Kharkov had begun to retreat. Also, west of Orel, the German and Soviet armies, centered on Alekseyevka, 11 miles east of Veynagayiv, were engaged in fierce battles along the Orel-Bryansk railway line. The German army continued to resist, preventing the Soviet army from encircling Bryansk, and only concentrated its main force east of Bryansk to continue its frontal assault. British military experts have observed that the Soviet main force is in danger of being exhausted before reaching Bryansk.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Renowned military commentator Lieutenant General Dittmar, in a broadcast yesterday, reviewed the overall war situation, stating that the Axis forces had gained a special advantage from the time factor. The war currently being waged on the Eastern Front can also be regarded as an attrition war. The German army has occupied a very large area on the Eastern Front in the past two years, and can adopt a defensive posture. To avoid unnecessary losses, it can also retreat in some areas. Whoever can utilize the time factor can gain a time advantage. In the large-scale summer campaign on the Eastern Front, the German army, due to its victory over time, has caused the enemy to suffer enormous losses.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Losses Reached 12th Last Month</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. According to the German News Agency: In July, the Allied forces destroyed Allied ships totaling more than 925,000 tons. Those damaged by bombs or torpedoes totaled more than 850,000 tons. Some of the enemy ships that were damaged may not be repairable. Therefore, the losses of Allied ships in July should be well over one million tons.</p>
<h3>India Implements Food Rationing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ranchi, 12th. According to a dispatch from New Delhi: Based on the decision of the Central Legislative Assembly, the Viceroy of India decided on the 11th that food rationing would be implemented immediately in all cities in India. Therefore, Bombay has begun training food rationing agencies.</p>
<h3>Thai Propaganda Director Leaves Manchukuo for Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hsinking, 12th. The Thai Propaganda Director, Mr. Sarad et al., having completed their mission to visit Manchukuo, departed from Hsinking by plane for Tokyo this morning.</p>
<h3>Allied Landing Attempt at Cape Orlando Fails</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th. According to a German military announcement, strong Allied forces attempted to land near Cape Orlando on the northern coast of Sicily on the 13th. They were immediately repulsed after being heavily bombarded by Axis forces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th. The German High Command announced on the 12th that the Axis forces in Sicily, according to plan, had retreated to the shortened bridgehead position. The enemy's attempt to land along the northern coast of the island resulted in heavy losses. The enemy's attempt to land at Cape Orlando in the northwest of the island was repelled by the Axis forces with the help of German airfields, and they were all wiped out.</p>
<h3>Welles Reportedly to Assume New Post</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Geneva, 12th. According to the German News Agency, "The New York Times" reported that it is rumored in Washington diplomatic circles that US Under Secretary of State Welles will be entrusted by President Roosevelt with an extremely important diplomatic mission. Welles often leaves the United States when he has a new assignment, and it is generally expected that he may give up his position as Under Secretary of State. Another rumor is that the US Ambassador to Argentina, Almar, will soon arrive in Washington to assume Welles' post.</p>
<h3>The New Financial System of Manchukuo (1)</h3>
<p>Establishing Domestic Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>The purpose of the Manchukuo industrial development plan is to develop Manchukuo, a typical agricultural country, into a highly industrialized nation. By 1941, the first plan was completed after overcoming various unfavorable objective conditions and shortcomings of the plan itself. Since last year, following the first plan, the second plan has been continued. This year is already the second year.</p>
<p>The results of the first year of the second plan, which ended at the end of March this year, will be announced at the upcoming regular meeting. Judging from various circumstances, the results are quite good.</p>
<p>The first plan was still characterized by a comprehensive dependence on Japan, while the characteristic of the second plan is to seek domestic self-sufficiency as much as possible in terms of materials and funds, so as to avoid dependence on Japan. Japan is pouring all its efforts into completing the Greater East Asia War. In order to make a real contribution to Japan's military strength, Manchukuo is not only reducing its dependence on Japan in a passive way, but also actively seeking to increase exports of iron, coal, and food to Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a system that enables self-sufficiency in materials and funds. This was clarified in the Outline of Basic National Policies of Manchukuo announced on December 8th last year, the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The Outline of National Policies has been clarified</p>
<p>Basic Financial Policies</p>
<p>In the field of funds, Manchukuo is an agricultural country and is in a colonial position with respect to mainland China. The accumulation of capital is negligible. Even if there is any, it is commercial capital and usurious capital, and it is extremely difficult to mobilize funds for heavy industry that are long-term, fixed, and low-interest. Therefore, the establishment of a new financial system is an urgent task. The Outline of Basic National Policies pointed out the trend of Manchukuo's finances in item 7 of the economic outline in Chapter 4, "Finance".</p>
<p>Eliminate all factors that hinder the equal value principle of the yen.</p>
<p>Thoroughly mobilize and allocate domestic funds to the production sector, and suppress speculation and excessive investment in the commercial sector, in order to absorb floating purchasing power.</p>
<p>Devise various active measures to digest national debt and encourage savings, cultivate and consolidate the securities market and domestic financial institutions, and seek to utilize indigenous capital.</p>
<p>Revise the central bank system and strengthen its national functions.</p>
<p>Of the above five items, the first item is temporarily set aside. The other four items, as important issues in the Manchukuo financial community, have already established concrete countermeasures and started implementation. Next, we will conduct some reviews on the wartime system of the Manchukuo financial community, which is gradually forming with this as the center.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of improving the central bank system in the fifth item above, it has been materialized by the new Manchukuo Central Bank Law in October last year. The new Manchukuo Central Bank is a note-issuing bank, and at the same time, in order to enable it to shoulder the task of a financial control agency, it assumes the function of the Financial Control Council. The amount of capital is 10 million yuan, funded by the government, with the status of a special legal entity. It started business on November 1 last year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reorganization of ordinary banking operations has also been actively carried out, starting with the central bank. In May of this year, the top management of the central bank was changed due to reorganization. Mr. Tsutomu Nishide, the former overseas financial officer stationed by the Ministry of Finance, was appointed as the president, and Mr. Shao-xiang Xu, the former governor of Fengtian Province, was appointed as the deputy president. A comprehensive system has been established to carry out the functions conferred by the new Central Bank Law.</p>
<p>Promoting Savings Campaigns</p>
<p>Domestic capital accumulation in Manchukuo is extremely poor. Therefore, most of the domestically raised funds planned in the first plan relied on the central bank to receive government bonds, issue currency, and supply it. However, the funds raised in this way contain the crisis of inducing malignant inflation. The trend of rising prices in recent years has warned the officials and people of Manchukuo. Especially during the unprecedented war, this inflationary tendency must be thoroughly eliminated.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the biggest issue in the Manchukuo financial community is to suppress inflation and mobilize indigenous capital. The central bank's acceptance of Manchukuo's national debt is bound to result in the increased issuance of national currency and the increase of purchasing power in the market. The prerequisite for suppressing inflation is to absorb this purchasing power. The national savings promotion campaign launched since 1939 with the Concordia Association as the center aims to absorb purchasing power. The target for 1939 was 500 million yuan, but it actually reached 630 million yuan. The target amount for 1940 was 800 million yuan, but it actually reached 830 million yuan. The target amount for 1941 was 1.1 billion yuan, and it actually reached 1.11 billion yuan, which was progressing smoothly. Last year's target amount increased by 400 million yuan compared to the previous year, to 1.5 billion yuan, but it actually only reached 1.16 billion yuan, short of the target by 340 million yuan. Therefore, the Manchukuo government, in view of the performance last year, after various reviews, formulated this year's target amount as 1.6 billion yuan, and is seeking various methods to achieve this target.</p>
<p>Based on the National Savings Law promulgated in June last year, the National Savings Association, as the center for promoting the savings promotion movement, has been established successively throughout Manchukuo. As of the beginning of this year, there are a total of 48,597 National Savings Associations throughout Manchukuo, with 1,577,932 members.</p>
<p>Of this year's savings target of 1.6 billion yuan, 500 million yuan is planned to be used to digest government bonds, and 1.1 billion yuan is used to expand production funds. In order to achieve this target amount, the National Savings Central Practice Committee stipulates the savings ratio for each agency and each province. Among the various agencies, bank deposits account for 530 million yuan, company reserve funds account for 390 million yuan, postal savings account for 178 million yuan, and insurance and lotteries account for 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Promoting the Digestion of Government Bonds</p>
<p>The Manchukuo's savings promotion movement, except for the year-end figures, can be said to be successful as described above. However, due to interest rates, it is quite difficult to mobilize the funds absorbed by various financial institutions for the production sector, and it is even more difficult to use these funds to digest government bonds. Therefore, in order to increase Manchukuo's contribution to Japan, it is necessary to direct the funds obtained from the savings promotion movement to the production sector and use them to digest government bonds.</p>
<p>In order to promote the digestion of government bonds, the Manchukuo government has stipulated the digestion amount for each agency since last year and encouraged them to purchase them. The planned issuance of government bonds for the fiscal year is 336 million yuan, of which 150 million yuan is allocated to various agencies. According to the Funds Control Law, compulsory purchase of government bonds by various companies has been implemented since last year. From the start of the second plan in April of the fiscal year to the end of the second plan in March 1947, during this period, companies will purchase government bonds at 20% of their net profit after exceeding one-tenth of the profit in each business year.</p>
<p>Therefore, ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives in Manchukuo, in response to the government's attempt to promote the digestion of government bonds, have been actively starting to hold corporate bonds since this spring.</p>
<p>In order to mobilize the funds absorbed by various financial institutions for the production sector, the first thing to do is to reduce the interest rate. The interest rate of ordinary banks in Manchukuo is high, and time deposits have an annual interest rate as high as 5% to 6%. Therefore, in order to mobilize these funds to the production sector, it is necessary to reduce the deposit interest rate first.</p>
<p>In August 1941, under the coordination of the central bank, banks, cooperatives, and unlimited companies in the four cities of Hsinking, Fengtian, Harbin, and Andong implemented the A, B, and C deposit interest rate agreements. Following this, in October, interest rate agreements were implemented in the thirteen cities of Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Tumen, Yanji, Longjing, Jilin, Siping, Tieling, Fushun, Anshan, Yingkou, and Jinzhou. On April 15 of this year, adjustments to the deposit and loan interest rates of financial institutions were implemented. The area for implementing the interest rate agreement, in addition to the original seventeen major cities, was expanded to include twenty-eight more cities, for a total of forty-five cities. At the same time, the interest rates of high-interest loans and time deposits were reduced to 0.8%.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the general decline in interest rate levels, the Manchukuo government also increased the issuance price of government bonds and reduced the government bond interest rate. Regarding the discount on commercial bills, loans secured by government bonds, and short-term overdrafts, the central bank also reduced them by 0.005% compared to before, and reduced the interest rate on those secured by other than bonds by 0.01%. In this way, Manchukuo's low-interest policy is even more thorough, and the mobilization of indigenous capital towards heavy industry and the guidance of the digestion of government bonds have made a leap forward.</p>
<p>Special Account for Joint Loans</p>
<p>Based on the progress of Manchukuo's controlled economy, due to various reasons such as the narrowing of the scope of commercial activities of indigenous capital and the increase in development funds, ordinary banks were temporarily in a situation where funds were difficult to lend. Therefore, under the coordination of the central bank, joint loans were established by ordinary banks to special companies. In November 1938, three banks jointly loaned 800,000 yuan to the Manchukuo Agricultural Products Corporation. After that, joint loans became increasingly developed, and almost all ordinary banks in Manchukuo participated in this joint loan group. As of May 2, the amount of loan investment totaled 41.8 million yuan, and the special deposit of the joint loan group to the central bank was 57.644 million yuan. The borrowers and amounts are as follows:</p>
<p>This joint loan system centrally collects the surplus funds of domestic ordinary banks and commercial and industrial financial cooperatives, and uses short-term deposits as long-term funds. The Manchukuo government and the central bank authorities, wanting to use it for the needs of national policy funds, cancelled the current joint loan system and established a special account for joint loans with an independent accounting organization within the central bank. As a result, the joint loan system has become increasingly developed, and its future operation is quite noteworthy. (Xiang: Footprints from the Allied World Weekly, No. 38)</p>

<h3>The Commercial Control Council Decides on Steps to Purchase Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>To be Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has decided to implement emergency measures. In response to speculation and hoarding, the "Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" and the "Implementation Guidelines" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council this time are measures to punish speculation and stabilize the market price of cotton yarn and cloth. It is now learned that the task of purchasing all the existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will be assigned to the National Commercial Control Council. The council is actively conducting research and plans to determine the entire</p>
<p>Implementation Steps for Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday (12th), the detailed rules for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth were discussed and decided upon at a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. After being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, they will be officially announced and implemented. According to a Central News Agency reporter who inquired from the Commercial Control Council yesterday, the council will establish a separate office</p>
<p>Specifically Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. It is expected to officially start operations within days. The internal structure will roughly consist of five sections: General Affairs, Handling, Inspection, Appraisal, and Storage. The personnel for each section are expected to be announced within the next day or two. All information regarding the quantity, location, etc. of the existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai</p>
<p>Will be Based on Registration</p>
<p>The information will be purchased based on the registration. If unregistered cotton yarn and cloth are discovered by the Materials Investigation Committee, the supervisory authorities will be notified for confiscation and strict punishment.</p>
<p>According to estimates from relevant parties, of the 600,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth stored in the city, 70% belong to Chinese merchants and 30% belong to Japanese merchants. The Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently conducting various purchasing matters with Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn merchants, and the work is extremely busy.</p>
<h3>The Circular Economy: Exchanging Cotton Products for Agricultural Products to Allocate Agricultural Products and Encourage Industry</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th - The Central Society stated that the National Government's decisive implementation of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will stabilize the lives of the people, revive the national economy, and advance the construction of the Greater East Asia economy. Japanese newspapers have enthusiastically commented on this matter. A summary of their main points is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Media Opinion</p>
<p>The Chinese National Government's implementation of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth marks the first step in addressing the pressing issues of economic recovery and stabilization of people's livelihoods in China. The purpose of the National Government's wise measure is to ensure the rational allocation of hoarded materials and gradually invigorate economic activity. On the production side, the aim is to purchase rice, wheat, and other agricultural products, providing cotton products to farmers to facilitate the smooth purchase of agricultural products. These agricultural products will then be appropriately allocated to revive urban industrial production and safeguard the production of key minerals. Subsequently, industrial products will be used to purchase agricultural products, creating a continuous cycle that will allow China's economic strength to make rapid progress. This will also stabilize people's livelihoods and strengthen the National Government's political power, making a greater contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Considering China's current situation, there seems to be no other way to achieve economic recovery. Therefore, we hope that in this time of decisive action by the National Government, we can actively cooperate and hope that the National Government will devote all its efforts to thoroughly promote this policy. However, if the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, the Chinese economy will face a severe crisis. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to ensuring effective and appropriate utilization.</p>
<h3>Bran Allocation Plan: Shanghai Districts to Sell at Two Price Levels Based on Type Soon</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, established to promote the rational buying and selling of flour and wheat to meet the needs of the people, first focused on controlling procurement. It formulated a unified plan for purchasing wheat, establishing branch offices in the main producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces to supervise and manage wheat merchants and purchase from producing areas at fixed prices. The wheat purchasing operation has now come to an end, and the purchased wheat has been centrally transported to flour mills in various regions for processing. Now that the flour mills have successively started flour production, the committee has specially formulated a bran allocation plan, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Branch offices in various regions have been actively handling matters. Flour and bran inventory registration by flour merchants has been completed. Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and other five districts have already started implementing flour allocation, with flour merchants selling according to the prescribed allocation quantities. As for flour and bran in Shanghai and other regions, allocation and sales will also begin in the near future. The total daily allocation quantity (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions) is over 38,000 units. Allocation prices are set at 311.26 yuan for first-grade flour, 270.06 yuan for second-grade flour, and 208.26 yuan for third-grade flour. Allocated merchants must take a legitimate profit of 25% based on the prescribed market price. Those who sell at a market price exceeding the added profit will be severely punished and have their allocation qualifications revoked.</p>
<h3>Future Source of Wood Pulp: To Be Shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wood pulp is an essential raw material for papermaking, and it has always relied on imports. After the incident, most of the imported pulp came from Manchuria, but the quantity has decreased recently. Therefore, in the future, it will be shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai to meet the demand. It is also understood that among the paper mills in Shanghai, there are sixteen Chinese-owned factories, including Jinzhou, Shenzhou, Julun, and Tianzhang, and eight Japanese-owned paper mills, including Tianzhang, Jiangnan, and Dazhong. However, due to raw material constraints, most of them have reduced production.</p>
<h3>Regulations Amended for Subletting Licenses</h3>
<p>Repair Costs Can Be Proportionally Shared</p>
<p>Public Notice from the First District Office: Regarding the third category of regulations for subletting licenses, amended as of September 1st of this year, as follows:</p>
<p>Subletting Profit Limited to 50%</p>
<p>The license should be displayed in a conspicuous place inside the premises. The licensee should provide the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the previous month's property tax, license fee, and water and electricity expenses (if these expenses are paid by the licensee and supplied to the subtenants). The licensee's profit from subletting rent should not exceed 50% of the net rent paid to the landlord, and the profit from other miscellaneous expenses should not exceed 10% of the actual amount paid. If there are necessary repairs, renovations, additions, or demolitions to the house that should not be solely borne by the landlord, or any expenses related to public health and Baojia needs of the residents, these may be proportionally shared with the consent of all residents, or the licensee may advance the full amount and then proportionally collect the amount, up to a maximum of 5% of the miscellaneous expenses paid.</p>
<p>Proportional Calculation of Rent and Miscellaneous Expenses</p>
<p>Collected monthly from the subtenants until the payment is completed. The amount of miscellaneous expenses and rent payable by each subtenant, as well as the amount payable by the licensee himself, should be calculated proportionally based on the size of the area occupied by each person and should be clearly stated in the rent receipt. If there are doubts or disputes among the subtenants regarding the rent payable, the District Office may, on its own initiative or upon receiving a written application from any subtenant, determine the appropriate rent for each subtenant. If the licensee has paid any gratuity to the landlord, the gratuity should not be included in the subtenant's rent for reimbursement.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da's Broadcast</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office, in collaboration with the Shanghai Radio Station, organized a broadcast to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. Last night (12th), Chief Pan of the Fourth Police Bureau of Shanghai delivered a broadcast. The main points are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>From now on, the entire city of Shanghai will be under the administration of our government, and all administrative affairs will be unified. Various facilities will naturally undergo improvements. In my opinion, the most important of these improvements is policing. First, the police are assistants to various administrative facilities. Second, the police are the officials closest to the people. Therefore, to promote the prosperity and tranquility of Shanghai, attention must first be paid to the facilities and construction of a strong police force. The policing of the Public Concession has been improved since our friendly nation, Japan, began to address it. Theft cases have decreased daily, and public safety has already been established. Regarding the specific issues after this, what I hope to resolve is: first, to crack down on illegal merchants; second, to strictly prohibit police from sheltering criminals; third, to strive to assist in relief efforts; and fourth, to establish police research institutions. Now that Shanghai's policing has been unified, the original Shanghai West Police organization will naturally undergo changes. I am coming to the end of my service in Shanghai West Police Department. Fortunately, during my tenure, I received timely instructions from my superiors and enthusiastic assistance from friendly nations, so that public safety was gradually improved. In addition to expressing my shame and apology, I also express my sincere gratitude to my superiors, friends from friendly nations, and the people of Shanghai West.</p>
<h3>Achieving the Mission of Cultural Development: Reorganization of the Municipal Education Association</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Zhou Huarren's Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Chen made a statement announcing the increase in the salaries of teachers and staff in municipal schools and the monthly allocation of 500,000 yuan to private primary and secondary schools for subsidies. After the announcement of this news, all teachers and staff in the city's schools felt very encouraged. The Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Zhou Huarren, Secretary-General of the Education Association, to inquire about the reorganization of the association and the distribution method of the subsidy, and Secretary-General Zhou gave the following detailed answer:</p>
<p>Reorganization to be Implemented in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation for the reorganization of the association, we have already consulted with the Ministry of Education. This reorganization will be carried out entirely in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated Education Association Law and the Education Association Regulations. First, we will prepare to establish district education associations, and then more than half of the district education associations will establish the municipal education association to make the association's structure sound and in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations. Starting this month, we have already started to handle matters related to the establishment of district education associations. Because September is the start of the school year for various schools, the reorganization of the association can be completed by then, making it a true people's organization in the city's education sector, working with the government to achieve the mission of cultural development.</p>
<p>Distribution of Education Subsidies to be Handled Properly</p>
<p>As for the government's compassion for the difficulties of teachers and staff, it resolutely allocated 500,000 yuan per month. This was proposed by Mayor Chen at the association's fifth meeting. It is now being implemented after the recovery of the concessions, which is of profound significance for the development of education in the city. We hope that teachers and staff of various schools can appreciate the government's efforts to maintain it and work hard in their duties. As for the distribution of these 500,000 yuan, the association will first distribute them to member schools that have joined the association and submitted a list of their teachers and staff to the association. Those who have not yet submitted the list are requested to fill it out and submit it as soon as possible for processing.</p>
<p>Fundraising for the Needy Education Fund</p>
<p>In addition, the association's fundraising for the needy education fund is awaiting support from all sectors to jointly accomplish this righteous act. After the fund is fully raised, we will review and approve requests from various schools and provide loans to needy students so that they can complete their studies.</p>
<p>Hoping for Joint Promotion from All Sectors</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the association has worked hard to improve the thinking in the education sector. What we regret is that, due to our own limited capabilities, we have not been able to do more for the welfare of impoverished teachers and students. Now that the municipal government is subsidizing 500,000 yuan per month, and we are also trying to raise funds to help needy students, we believe that this will be of some help to the future of education in the city. However, this is only the beginning, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will jointly promote education and contribute their greatest support.</p>
<h3>The Central District's Public Granary Office Ordered to Cease Work</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Food Bureau supervised the distribution of food according to population in the city, public granary joint offices were established in various districts to help promote food administration. However, it was found that the Central District's public granary joint office was not handling public affairs properly. The bureau has ordered them to cease work. All distribution of rice flour certificates will be carefully distributed by the public granary offices in each district in conjunction with the Baojia chiefs, so that the district's food distribution work will not be delayed.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Coal Allocation Applications for Factories is the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The authorities are allocating approximately 15,000 tons of coal per month to Chinese-owned factories. The deadline for factories to apply for coal for the period from October to December of this year has been set for the day after tomorrow (15th). The application procedures for coal allocation must be submitted to the Dazhong Coal Company one and a half months before the start of each period. All items to be filled in on the application form for the required coal quantity for that period must be filled in detail so that they can be submitted to the competent authority.</p>
<h3>No Changes to the Structure of Baojia Cadres</h3>
<p>After the recovery of the two concessions, the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, under the jurisdiction of the First and Eighth District Offices, has not undergone any changes to its cadre administrative structure. They continue to serve with their past spirit and assist the police authorities of the two districts in maintaining security within the boundaries. According to Baojia cadre personnel, the duties of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps have become even more important than before after the takeover of the concessions. In the future, we must earnestly fulfill the important responsibility of self-defense and self-protection. All members of the Self-Defense Corps must faithfully assist the police authorities in all matters related to local security, sanitation, transportation, and air defense and fire prevention to achieve even better results.</p>
<h3>Post Office Postcards to Become Relics</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the postcards issued by the Post Office will become a kind of relic in postal history. This is because of the shortage of wood pulp. The Post Office does not intend to reprint them and will no longer sell them after the stock is sold out.</p>
<h3>44th Issue of Flour: Quantity Increased to 1.5 Jin</h3>
<p>Household Rice for the Same Period to Be Announced Separately</p>
<p>The First District Office recently issued a notice stating that coupon No. 43 of the rice purchase book is valid until the 15th of this month and will be invalid after the deadline. From the 14th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the rice sales offices of the office will only sell flour with coupon No. 44 of the flour certificate. At that time, the rice shops with registered numbers on the coupon will sell 1.5 jin of No. 2 flour per coupon at a price of 10.5 yuan. The distribution of rice with coupon No. 44 of the rice purchase certificate will be announced separately. Furthermore, rice shops will stop selling for one day on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>On the Return of Concessions and the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Remarks by Director Hirota of the Information Department</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Director of the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Hirota, met with reporters at the Broadway Building at 6:00 PM to discuss the significance of the return of concessions and the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and to express his views on future policies, as follows: After the return of concessions on August 1st, all concessions in China have been returned, marking the completion of China's political independence. This political independence also means that China has broken free from the influence of Britain and the United States and achieved complete independence. That is, a semi-colonial country has developed into a completely independent nation. The independence referred to here is political independence. However, to achieve true independence, it is necessary to strive for ideological independence and economic independence.</p>
<p>Breaking Free from Anglo-American Thought</p>
<p>The so-called ideological independence means that the Chinese people break free from Anglo-American thought and return to the true Eastern thought of the Chinese people. Economic independence means that China progresses from a semi-colonial economy to the economy of an independent country.</p>
<p>The return of concessions is indeed a successful achievement through the fervent and genuine efforts of the Nationalist Government. On the other hand, it also represents Japan's determination to carry out its policies decisively. As a result, the imperialistic aggressive forces of Britain and the United States against China have been expelled from Chinese territory. However, this is only the first step. The real effort for constructive development, which is the passive aspect of achieving independence, begins today. Therefore, the urgent tasks are, first, to complete ideological and economic independence, and second, to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>When building a new order centered on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and Europe, we are resolutely fighting against Britain and the United States to promote our policies. If we do not win the war, there will be no new world order, and the people of Greater East Asia will not be liberated. To put it simply, if China and Japan do not achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War, they cannot achieve the completion of China's political, economic, and ideological independence. Japan has now entered the final stage of the Greater East Asia War, establishing an invincible posture domestically and working hard to establish that posture with the Chinese National Government and the people. We express our respect for the winning economic system of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth this time, which fully demonstrates the true spirit of sharing weal and woe.</p>
<p>Transforming Economic Policies</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the central points of China's active construction in the future, focusing on ideological and economic independence, and to fully recognize that China's economy will endure.</p>
<p>China's semi-colonial status: When Britain was establishing the Australian Confederation Empire, it declared that China was in the same position as India and Australia and was included in the sterling area.</p>
<p>In China, the railways, ships, factories, and all their capital were mostly dominated by British and American capital in pounds and gold dollars, causing China's production to benefit the British and Americans. Although China has now gained political independence, it must also gain economic independence. Therefore, China should stop working entirely for the benefit of British and American capital and should reform the organization to benefit the Chinese people. Otherwise, it cannot establish a truly independent national organization. In the current world situation, the key to China becoming an economically independent country lies in the following three points:</p>
<p>First, fully harmonize with the Greater East Asia economy.</p>
<p>Second, prioritize public interest, especially putting politics first.</p>
<p>Third, transform the free-market economy into a controlled economy.</p>
<p>However, there will certainly be great difficulties in the process of achieving economic independence. To obtain fruits, one must first cultivate the land, sow seeds, and fertilize, and then one can harvest. Because there is no one who can harvest without sowing seeds. Fortunately, the power and responsibility endowed to the East Asian people are great, and success is undoubtedly guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Limits Machine Supply: Purchases of Machinery Next Year Must Be Submitted to Associations</h3>

<h3>Sixth Term Rationed Sugar: Preparations for Distribution</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the supply of sugar in Shanghai, the military authorities are arranging for a large amount of sugar to be shipped from Taiwan and allocated to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to handle the rationing of sugar per capita and special allocations to various industries. A Shanghai News reporter learned from related sources yesterday that the total amount of sugar in stock in Shanghai is over 200,000 bags, which is sufficient to maintain normal needs for a long time. Preparations for the sixth term of rationed sugar have begun, and an announcement will soon be made for distribution per capita based on purchase certificates. As for the sugar specially allocated to various industries, notification letters have been issued based on previously approved amounts, and purchase certificates have been issued.</p>
<h3>Iron Gates in Nanshi: Clearing Obstacles, Opening on the 15th</h3>
<p>Regarding the general opening of the iron gates in various districts of Nanshi, which have been closed, to restore the original state in order to help the revival of Nanshi, the authorities have internally decided to implement this on the 15th of this month. Starting yesterday, the sand, stones, and other obstacles piled up at the entrances of all iron gates to be opened are being cleared.</p>
<h3>Simple Insurance Bureau Establishes District Offices</h3>
<p>The Social Simple Insurance Bureau has recently observed that over half of the factories in this city have participated in compulsory labor insurance. In order to facilitate future business, it has established business offices in the main districts of this city. Except for the business in Zhabei and Pudong, which will be handled directly by the bureau for the time being, the First Business Office will be established in the First District, the Second Business Office in the Eighth District, the Third Business Office in the Seventh District, and the Fourth Business Office in the Fifth and Sixth Districts of Pudong. These offices will be established separately within days, and the candidates for the heads of each business office have also been internally decided.</p>
<h3>Salt Bureau Investigates Unauthorized Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been panic buying of salt in this city, all due to false rumors, leading to speculation and illegal price increases. Since the salt administration authorities strictly ordered the Yuhua Company to allocate a large amount of salt from its inventory to various salt shops, sub-salt shops, and sauce shops, the supply of salt on the market has become very abundant. Furthermore, they have ordered that sales must comply with the listed prices and that no private price increases are allowed. It has also been learned that the Songjiang District Salt Administration Bureau, under the direction of the senior salt administration authorities and the General Administration Bureau of Salt Affairs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is actively rectifying the situation, dispatching officers to various salt merchants to investigate whether there are any cases of outwardly complying but inwardly violating the regulations by not selling at the listed prices. If any violations are found, they will be sent to the court for strict punishment. All officers ordered to inspect carry official documents and wear badges, which can be requested for inspection. Any cases of imposters and swindlers should be reported.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Cigarette Stalls</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the tobacco monopoly, the China Tobacco Company has been responsible for overall distribution, aiming to suppress prices and reduce the burden on the people. Recently, in the Nanshi area, some people have come up with the idea of setting up stalls along the streets to collect expensive cigarettes for sale on the black market. The Second Police Bureau of the city believes that these stalls are undermining the tobacco monopoly and has issued a special order to the three police sub-bureaus in Nanshi to resolutely crack down on them.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

Mr. Yoshida, a researcher of Chinese affairs from a friendly nation, has been specially invited to speak on "Striving for Victory in the Greater East Asia Holy War and the Relationship to Resolving the Sino-Japanese War." It is reported that the members of the Industrial Co-Prosperity Forum will each send youth representatives to attend and prepare opinions to be discussed at the meeting.</p>

<h3>Emergency Relief Basketball Completed Successfully: Paramount Defeats Zhongbei Last Night; Women's Exhibition: White Goose Beats Huatong by One Point</h3>
<p>The emergency relief basketball campaign for North China charity is over. The North-South battle between Zhongbei and Paramount, after three dramatic encounters, finally came to a successful end. Last night, amidst the rain and wind, the curtain fell. The situation of this charity match was quite enthusiastic. Especially last night, despite the roaring wind and the knee-deep water on most roads, the Zhongqing Stadium was still full, proving that the audience's enthusiasm for supporting the match came from the heart. Last night's women's exhibition match between Huatong and White Goose was tense and exciting, with thunderous applause. In the end, White Goose narrowly defeated Huatong by one point. In the main battle, Paramount was full of energy and took the lead in every quarter. It was initially planned to have Bao Songyuan and Li Zude, two tiger generals, play, but due to the regulations, Zhu was unable to have unregistered players participate, resulting in a lack of substitutes in the later stages. As a result, they only had three players left to fight against the many, and the game ended hastily. However, Paramount still won 43-30, which was a slight blemish in an otherwise perfect event.</p>
<p>Last night's charity ball auction was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. First, an anonymous philanthropist purchased it for 20,000 yuan and then donated it for re-auction. It still started at 5,000 yuan, and the price quickly soared to 30,000 yuan, which was won by Mr. Wang Erlin, the general manager of the Bank of Greater China. However, Mr. Wang, seeing the enthusiasm of the charity sale, donated it again for auction. As a result, in a straight-line auction, it was purchased by Mr. Xia Shikui for 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Sports Association to Host Tennis Championships: Registration Begins the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Sansheng, the chairman of the Three Provinces Sports Association, organized the Three Provinces Tennis Team, recruiting famous players in Shanghai, including Tang Jia, Yu Tianguang, Liang Deguang, San Yuanguan, Liu Chongben, and Tao Guanqiu, the former McGram member. Five people, including Wang Shuqing and Zhu Mintang, were appointed as committee members, and a Shanghai Open Tennis Team Championship will be held. Registration will begin the day after tomorrow (the 15th) at the office of Mr. Jin at 201 Julais Road.</p>
<p>Time of dispatch yesterday: 7:20 PM</p>
<h3>Visit to the Bosco Children's Home (4): Mission, Life, and Expectations</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to the two major missions mentioned above, the Bosco Children's Home also ran an agricultural school in Nanxiang, recruiting poor children from the countryside, teaching them scientific farming and cultivation, and training them to become cadres to improve Chinese agriculture. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it was forced to close. Last year, an agricultural college was established in Jiangwan (at the end of Maicao Road), with Father Kang Yi as the president. The first class selected 20 students from the St. Bosco School who were poor and of similar temperament, teaching them modern agricultural science. The main subjects were animal and plant chemistry, with special emphasis on agronomic cultivation, pest control, improved methods, increased by-products, and agricultural product processing industries. The level ranged from the fifth and sixth grades of primary school to junior high school, aiming to enable graduates to become cadres for agricultural improvement movements. The Nanxiang Agricultural School has also sent personnel to prepare for its restoration.</p>
<p>All missions of the Children's Home adopt its special educational method, namely the "Preventive System," which does not infringe on the freedom of students and does not adopt strict coercion or punishment after offenses. Their teaching methods mainly consist of: a warm and loving father's heart, a kind and pleasant attitude, patient and persuasive instruction, a tireless spirit, and meticulous and thoughtful care. They enable children to be active in an environment where they cannot make mistakes, inspire the roots of morality in their hearts, and eliminate their bad words and habits. The "Celebration Institute" is dedicated to inviting various poor children from outside the school on Sundays and holidays, allowing them to play, exercise, talk, and listen to teachings at the school, each following their own inclinations to inspire their desire to learn and improve. For students who have left school, they organize the "Old Students Association" to enable them to unite and help each other. All students have the affection of brothers and often communicate with their alma mater to receive spiritual help. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Shanghai and the Price Problem</h3>
<p>The reorganization of Shanghai presents many problems, and the most important is the problem of high prices centered in Shanghai. Although the authorities have promulgated various laws and implemented various restrictions, the rise in prices has not stopped, and there is a risk of further inflation in the recent situation. Originally, the reasons for the high prices in Shanghai were, from the perspective of goods, insufficient materials due to the cessation of imports and stagnation of production, and the lack of smooth material circulation. From the perspective of currency, the difficulties in recovering currency, the sharp increase in investment speculation, and the loosening of loans. This imbalance between goods and currency is the cause of high prices. Although the authorities have requested many countermeasures for these problems, they have had no effect. The reason for this is worth considering. The current characteristic of high prices in Shanghai is that prices tend to rise even when goods are available. It is a fact that Shanghai has a considerable amount of materials, but these materials are not in the market but outside the market, that is, outside the circulation process. Those outside the market are so-called hoarding and purchasing, so hoarding is the main cause of high prices. According to the report of Mr. Yoshida Seiji, a member of the Sino-Japanese goodwill mission (see this newspaper on August 8 and 9), the reason for the high prices lies in the psychology of the people outside of economic principles. What dominates the psychology of the people is the observation of the world war situation by the Chinese people and the economic conspiracy implemented by the enemy. For the economic reasons for high prices, various countermeasures are now being implemented and will naturally be strengthened in the future. At the same time, the non-economic reasons pointed out by Mr. Yoshida should also be paid attention to and vigilance should be maintained, and appropriate countermeasures should be sought. This is the central problem of reorganizing Shanghai at present, and it should not be neglected in price countermeasures. (Xiang: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi editorial published in the Mainland News on August 12)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Restricts Partnership Qian Zhuang: Reorganize According to Law and on Time</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Qian Industry Association: Regarding the matter of partnership organizations of Qian Zhuang that have already opened for business to complete registration, it was previously approved by the Ministry to allow them to be reorganized into company organizations within one year before re-registration. If they are not reorganized after the deadline, they should be ordered to cease business according to law, and this has been communicated to all on file. The above-mentioned deadline for completing registration expires on August 20 of this year. Many partnership Qian Zhuang have complied with the regulations and come to register, but there are still many who are waiting and watching and have not applied to the Ministry. The Ministry's amendment to the regulations on the capital amount of financial institutions refers to increasing the capital of financial institutions that have already been approved for registration and newly established financial institutions. The partnership Qian Zhuang that voluntarily choose to reorganize within the prescribed time limit according to the old plan and then increase their capital after the registration is approved, if their capital is less than the newly set limit, will be in compliance with the procedures. In order to avoid misunderstandings among the above-mentioned partnership Qian Zhuang, please investigate and inform them to submit an application for completion of registration before August 20, and do not wait and see. This order.</p>
<h3>The First District Economic Office Strictly Enforces Price Limits</h3>
<p>The First District Economic Office of the Shanghai Special City continues to carry out the work of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Bureau of Material Control. That is, before the office has issued new price limits for the prices of various goods in various industries, it must continue to implement the price limits of the former Bureau of Material Control and must absolutely not have any price increases beyond the limited prices. Investigators will be dispatched to conduct strict investigations, and if any violations are found, they will be severely punished. Furthermore, it is hoped that the citizens will truthfully report them.</p>
<h3>Savings Week to Be Held Monthly</h3>
<p>In order to attract funds, promote thrift and savings, stabilize prices, and ensure that funds are used in proper channels, the silver and money industry has launched Savings Week, scheduled from September 5 to 14. It was learned yesterday that this Savings Week has been very successful, which shows that the citizens have a considerable understanding of the meaning of thrift and savings. In order to facilitate citizens' deposits, the member banks and businesses in the silver and money industry have specially extended their business hours by one hour during Savings Week to handle various matters related to thrift and savings. Businesses and businesses that accept thrift and savings are divided into fixed-term and current accounts, and the interest rate is higher than ordinary deposits as an incentive. The first Savings Week is scheduled to end tomorrow, and thereafter it will be held from August 8 every month, with other dates, and each bank and business will continue to handle thrift and savings matters, but the business hours will not be extended.</p>
<h3>Financial Stability in the City; Bank Closure Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Since the National Government announced the Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth on the 9th, general speculators and hoarders have been panicked, but the financial situation is still stable. However, a certain newspaper on August 12 carried a news item "Speculators on the Road to Ruin, Small Banks Closing One After Another," stating that after the National Government purchased cotton yarn and cloth at market prices, more than a dozen banks had closed down or suspended payments due to the cotton yarn and cloth problem. The reporter believes that this matter is related to the financial security of Shanghai, so he visited the Banking Association of this city to inquire about the truth. It was said that the report was not true. It was found that the Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank had suspended payments due to tight turnover, which was still a matter of last week. Recently, other banks have been operating as usual, and there is no such thing as closing down one after another. In matters concerning the overall financial situation, it is hoped that all sectors will not misunderstand.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced an influx of sellers. The situation rose twice in the morning, but then fell back. The market stabilized at noon, with most stocks closing slightly higher than the previous day, and some rising back up. After noon, there was a sudden rise, as it was heard that the Central Reserve Bank had decided to maintain small banks and Qian Zhuang that had difficulty settling temporary positions, and it was rumored that the silver and money industry would soon undertake stock mortgages. This stimulated the morale of all parties that had been weak for four and a half days, and new and old speculators were fully mobilized again. The new industrial stock, New Asia, had already entered the 90s, but in the afternoon, the buying sentiment from all parties was strong, and it returned outside the 90s, and is still advancing towards the 100s. Sino-French was around 60, and Five Continents and Xinyi were slightly lower. New Star Pharmaceutical also rose back up after falling. Scientific Chemical rose close to 30 due to buyer demand. Among the department stores, Yong An Company's price at noon was higher than the previous day's afternoon price, and it continued to rise in the afternoon, rising by several tens. New Sun entered the 30s after breaking through, but ultimately stabilized. China National Products slightly declined, China Underwear also retreated into the 90s and then came back out with buyers. Lai An Department Store was around 50. The textile industry was the least volatile. Yong An Textile was again at the 1400 level, with few inquiries. Lunhua was still opening within the 50s, and Xinyi had supply without demand, falling into the 70s. Ren Sheng, Tianlun, Hongzhu, Greater China Manufacturing, Zhenfeng, etc. all saw declines, stabilizing at noon. Jingfu Shirt was weak, falling close to 30.

<h3>Match Distribution is Being Planned</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Match Industry Association, in view of the high prices of matches, which affect people's livelihood, has decided to implement a distribution system in order to prevent hoarding and manipulation and to seek reasonable supply. It has now formulated a plan for distribution per household and submitted it to the relevant authorities for approval. It is reported that the distributed matches will mainly be from five major factories, namely "Daming, Dahua, China, Zhonghua, and Guang," while other smaller factories will not be included. It is estimated that the monthly consumption in this city is about 1,000 to 2,000 boxes, but the amount of distribution will depend on raw materials and output.</p>

<h3>The Value of Setbacks</h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>In most people's minds, setbacks are seen as a waste of effort and a loss with no gain. In fact, this is not only wrong but also a harmful assessment. Why? Because this wrong idea is deeply ingrained, causing many people to feel that they have reached the end of the road with no way to recover when they encounter setbacks. Therefore, they stop and lose the courage to fight again. So, we really need to re-evaluate the value of setbacks. I think setbacks may cause some undeniable losses, but if you: analyze and review the reasons for setbacks with an open mind and in detail, you can find out where your previous plans went wrong, so that you can clearly see what kind of obstacles are in front of you, and then you can adopt appropriate methods to overcome and avoid them in the next test.</p>
<p>So, encountering setbacks is not a misfortune. It is a touchstone for every successful person. The real misfortune is that after you encounter setbacks, you do not analyze and review the reasons for their failure, and thus fail to obtain the compass that guides you to success. Sun Yat-sen and Edison, these two well-known great men, before their success, which one did not encounter many setbacks? But the reason why they were able to achieve immortal achievements was that they were able to patiently find the reasons for the setbacks, analyze and review them, and take them as lessons to avoid repeating these setbacks.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Seventy Years</h3>
<p>— Ding Fubao</p>
<p>When I was young, my body was weak, and as I grew older, worries increased. Unexpectedly, I have actually lived to seventy years old, worthy of celebrating myself for this: one.</p>
<p>I deeply know that not eating animals and eggs, and eating more fruits, is the best way to maintain health. The Surangama Sutra says, "Those who eat meat sever the seeds of great compassion. I observe sentient beings, transmigrating through the six realms, falling as parents, close relatives, and family members, devouring each other's flesh, all are relatives. Constantly generating harmful thoughts, increasing suffering, revolving in birth and death, unable to escape." I have been vegetarian for a long time, firstly, it accords with hygiene, and secondly, it does not create karmic debts with animals. Therefore, my physical strength and spirit are becoming increasingly healthy. My future is still long, and I have not yet reached my limit, worthy of celebrating myself for this: two.</p>
<p>I live quietly at home, with coarse rice porridge sufficient to fill my belly, with cloth and cotton wadding sufficient to ward off the winter cold, with children sufficient to entertain my old age, with servants sufficient to answer the door and sweep and clean, with a dozen or so rooms sufficient to shelter from wind and rain, with five or six grandchildren who sometimes come to the study to play. Truly, it is like what Du Fu described in his poem, "Competing to ask about affairs, eagerly pulling." My life is perhaps too comfortable, worthy of celebrating myself for this: three.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shizeng said, "Although it is not conducive to fame and fortune, if there are published works passed down to future generations, one will not be despised." I have no academic lineage, but I have buried myself in hard work for fifty years, engraving and compiling two continuations of the "Shuowen Jiezi", the "Buddhist Studies Dictionary," and dozens of other works such as "Gujin Da Cidian", worthy of celebrating myself for this: four.</p>
<p>Last summer, various relatives and friends wanted to pre-celebrate my seventieth birthday. I felt ashamed and burdened by my empty life, even more so by my fame and career, which would be enough to sow praise. Therefore, I wrote a letter saying that I would not celebrate birthdays while alive and would not hold memorial services after death. My colleagues understood my intentions and specifically set out four rules: 1. No celebrations. 2. No invitations. 3. No banquets. 4. Those who must celebrate my birthday should instead donate cash to the Shen Bao Education Fund and the Fuyou Orphanage Fund, worthy of celebrating myself for this: five.</p>
<p>I am naturally fond of collecting books, and also fond of distributing them. Seven out of ten books in the Wuxi Shishi Academy Library were donated by me. The Wuxi County Public Library, the Shanghai Municipal Library, and the Aurora University Library have also received many books donated by me. The latter is named the Ding Family Collection, with about 50,000 volumes. I still have 150,000 to 160,000 volumes of books, sufficient for reviewing the old and learning the new, and for entertaining myself in old age, worthy of celebrating myself for this: six. The books I compiled, such as "Practical Experiences in Learning Buddhism," "Guide to Buddhist Studies," "Collection of Buddhist Beliefs," and "Records of the Great Dao's Retreat," were all highly praised by Master Yin Guang. Layman Mei Guangqin also used these books, with the approval of the Ministry of Justice, as educational materials in prisons. The reasons for cause and effect and the principles of reincarnation that I advocate, although unchanging through millions of lifetimes, have likely influenced many people, worthy of celebrating myself for this: seven.</p>
<p>In front of the Wuxi Public Garden, I have a residence of more than twenty rooms, worth about a million dollars. Now I am donating it to the Pure Land Society and the Buddhist Studies Association to build the Three Saints Pavilion and a place for studying the classics. Compared to my personal preservation, it will surely last forever, worthy of celebrating myself for this: eight.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao newspaper held a basketball competition, and Mr. Hui Kang saw the opportunity and purchased it at the highest price, donating it to the North China Relief Fund as a memorial for my seventieth birthday. This is also a good deed, worthy of celebrating myself for this: nine.</p>
<p>At the age of seventy, Fubao began to regret chasing external pursuits throughout his life, and the errors of using the discriminating mind and attachment. Now I will decline all positions as directors and presidents of various organizations, charities, and schools in Shanghai, and focus on cultivating Chan and Pure Land, severing all connections, naturally attaining liberation, worthy of celebrating myself for this: ten.</p>
<h3>Mistakes</h3>
<p>— Liang Yue</p>
<p>All people have "mistakes"; however, those who know their "mistakes" and can correct them are few and far between.</p>
<p>Moreover, people often do not perceive their own "mistakes"; even if others advise them, they stubbornly persist.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "To know one's mistakes and be able to correct them is the greatest good," and "Those involved are deluded, while bystanders are clear," meaning is precisely this.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone has "mistakes," and the important thing is to be able to correct them. If one wants to correct "mistakes," one must humbly accept correct criticisms from others, so as not to unknowingly fall into error, procrastinate, and delay one's whole life.</p>
<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— Liang Yin</p>
<p>Outside the school gate, on Shangcang Bridge, we sadly wave goodbye with tears, from now on each of us will rush towards our future, drifting wherever fate takes us. Under the classroom window, we share a hall, watching and enjoying the harmonious atmosphere. Parting is easy, meeting is difficult, when will we meet again? I still remember the past events, good dreams are difficult to relive. When I wake up, I am sadly disappointed, my heart is empty and resentful.</p>
<h3>Nightmare</h3>
<p>— Yingqin</p>
<p>It was a summer evening, already nine o'clock. Fourteen-year-old Xiao Ying was mending her torn socks, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>While mending, she was just drowsily wanting to sleep. Vaguely, she didn't know if she was dreaming or reminiscing? She suddenly returned to the situation two years ago, when she was twelve years old. On this day, she was on a small bicycle, followed by her adoptive father and mother. Bringing candies and biscuits, they went to the nearby garden! Xiao Ying's face was smiling, and her father and mother were also full of smiles, praising her intelligence, liveliness, and beauty. Her father said, "Today is to celebrate Xiao Ying's third-place exam. We hope Xiao Ying will continue to improve in the future and get first place every year." At that time, Xiao Ying's mouth almost reached her ears...</p>
<p>Smack! Xiao Ying suddenly woke up from her fantasy. Just as she rubbed her eyes, another "smack" sound came from Xiao Ying's body. It made her feel a numb pain. It turned out that her stepmother was fiercely beating her, mercilessly whipping her with a feather duster. She could only tremble, not daring to cry or even defend herself...</p>
<p>"Damn you! You want to die, die properly! Electricity is so expensive, two dollars a word. Your father always says I play mahjong at night, but you're keeping the lights on to... If you can't get up to empty the chamber pot tomorrow, I'll definitely pour it on your mouth! I don't have time to deal with you, you spendthrift! I'm going to play mahjong now. I'm going to eat bird's nest soup when I get back, anyway, I have so many good things, I can't take them to the coffin. Hurry up and cook it for me, but don't burn it again. I'll settle the score with you tomorrow for whatever happens."</p>
<p>She scolded for a while before running out, her anger still not subsided.</p>
<p>Xiao Ying silently endured the scolding. After preparing the bird's nest soup, she returned to the bedside, feeling extremely wronged thinking about her violent stepmother, and even more so about her dead mother. She couldn't help but feel sadness welling up, and tears quickly flowed down again (Scholarships for needy students).</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Medicine and Drug Relief Association Seeks Members with Good Results</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chinese Medicine and Drug Relief Association, with the purpose of promoting Chinese medicine and drug relief for the poor and sick, with Chairman Kai Lanting, is currently organizing members. It is divided into: 1. Chinese Medicine Group, 2. Medicinal Material Group, 3. Decoction Piece Group, 4. Ginseng and Bird's Nest Group, 5. Charity Group. It began recruiting members on August 1st. 1. Honorary Member, 5,000 yuan per year, 2. Basic Member, 1,000 yuan per year, 3. Supporting Member, 500 yuan per year, 4. Special Member, 200 yuan per year, 5. Ordinary Member, 50 yuan per year. Membership fees are collected by Shanghai Yarn Industry Bank, China Pharmaceutical Industry Bank, and Tiancheng Qianzhuang. The results of the first membership recruitment on August 8th were reported, with the number of receipts reaching 100,000 yuan. Each team leader is exceptionally enthusiastic, anticipating a better outcome at the second meeting on August 15th. The association receives membership fees entirely to support medical treatment and medicine distribution for various charitable organizations, such as Renji Shantang, Guangyi Shantang, Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital, National Public Civilian Hospital, and Shanghai South Charity Association. At this time of year, between summer and autumn, there are more diseases. If there were no charitable organizations providing medical treatment and medicine distribution, the poor and sick would have nowhere to turn for treatment. The situation is particularly pitiful. It is hoped that all sectors will actively contribute to this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Two Educational Institutions Seek Help</h3>
<p>The Yixin Elementary School Association on Guohuo Road in Nanshi was destroyed on the 11th of this month. The school currently has more than 500 students, all of whom are from poor families in Nanshi. It also has a vocational night school attached to it. It is hoped that relevant authorities and philanthropists will generously assist in teaching.</p>
<p>Also, the Cilian Nursing Home at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road was also destroyed on the same day, causing more than a thousand elderly and weak people to stand in the accumulated water, the situation is very miserable. The Cilian Disaster Relief Association is urgently seeking reconstruction, but the estimated cost is more than 100,000 yuan. It is deeply hoped that society will embrace the compassion of helping those in need, actively donate, so that these thousand or so victims can be spared the suffering of sleeping in the wind.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Advancement Meeting to Conclude Soon</h3>
<p>In order to cultivate teachers and improve the teaching in various schools, this newspaper specially held an elementary school summer advancement meeting, inviting famous professors from various universities to lecture. More than 200 teachers from more than 130 units voluntarily participated.

Educationist Sun Xiangzhong will give a speech on the relationship between the Three Principles philosophy and education. In addition to the lectures, there are recreational activities such as singing, martial arts, ball games, drama, and chess, as well as visits to factories, health checkups, concerts, and elementary school forums. Once the term is over, the association will issue certificates to reward them.</p>
