<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>論二國會議</h3>
<p>— 木公</p>
<p>英美蘇三國會議即將揭幕，在此世界戰爭進入決戰階段之際，反軸心國此種政治的策動，具有頗堪尋味的意義，自無待言。茲請從會議之動機，會議之主題，三國之企圖及可能之趨勢，完全以客觀與公正之立塲加以分析，在使國人了解國際大局這一點上，或許不是毫無意義的事。</p>
<p>三國會議之醖釀，遠自羅斯福邱吉爾奎貝克會議之際。當時英美未會邀請蘇聯參加反軸心國的戰略會議，蘇方乃有「無參加必要」之表示，實際上顯出反軸心國之「貌合神離」。因此在會議閉幕之時，又傳出了羅邱急盼與史太林親自會談的消息，以圖維繫三國在反德戰爭中的團結。而為着顧全職爭的實際情形起見，即羅斯福固不能　赴莫斯科之苦衷，史太林更明白表示無離開蘇境一步之可能，於是主張在三巨頭會談之前，儘先舉行三國外交會議，以期廊淸三國戰時加强團結的若干障碍，探索戰後繼續合作的可能條件，以圖覓取比較適當的對策。在共同對德的總前提下，强化三國軍事政治及經濟三方面的協力。我想三國當局的最終目標雖然不同，然而此次三國外長會議之動機，差不多就是如此。</p>
<p>那麽，此次美英蘇會議將討論些什麽問題呢？從國際戰局來觀察，也許三方面都有統一戰略協同作戰的要求吧？然而，看來參加會議的人選，都是外交方面的人物，顯然，此次會議將不會觸及軍事，因為，蘇聯固然不願談及太平洋方面的戰略，英美却害怕再聽到關於第二戰綫的淪　。不談軍事，專論外交，自然要討論到政治問題，這是此次會議的中心。除了蘇聯一直保持緘默以外，我們已經聽到各方面的傳說和揣測，比較最有確實的可能性的，大槪此次會議議題，將為：（甲）關於目前三國外交問題者，（乙）關於戰後國際秩序問題者。就前者而言，包含　巴爾幹諸國問題，　近東及中東問題，　波羅的海三國問題，　芬蘭及波蘭問題，　地中海問題等等，這些問題，又是彼此互相聯系，具有錯綜複雜的關係。就後者而言，根本是虛無飄渺的問題。當然，就輕重緩急衡量，此次會議的重心似乎放在目前外交問題之解決，以及加强合作這一方面的。</p>
<p>參加會議的各國，顯然各具懐抱，就撇開英美兩國相互間的矛盾暫時不談，在此次會議中，資本主義的英美，和社會主義的蘇聯間微妙的關係之表現，也是頗堪尋味的。柏林和倫敦方面的報道，蘇聯在此次會議中，將提出如下要求：「波羅的海沿海諸國併入蘇聯，　波蘭東部至寇松綫為止併入蘇聯，　貝薩拉比亞併入蘇聯，　承認一九三九年蘇芬戰爭後蘇芬條約所定國界綫，　蘇聯對於羅馬足亞，保　利亞，南斯拉夫，及伊朗諸國的親密互助關係。但是以上自　至　各項，實際上即是一九三九年蘇芬戰爭結果所定蘇芬國界及一九四一年德蘇戰爭爆發以前的　聯西部國界。在蘇聯，不能算是「要求」，也不需要提出「要求」，而英美方面，却想用「承認」此種國界與否為談判中討價還價的條件。因此，蘇聯方面已經在日前宣稱「此次會議將不討論國界問題」，以免徒生枝節。客觀的觀察，蘇聯今日所望於英美的非常明確，即　集中全力開闢西綫，即眞正的第二戰綫；　給蘇聯以更多更切實的物質接濟；　放棄對巴爾幹，地中海，近東中東及其他各地小國的反蘇活動；　在戰爭中勿忙於討論戰後問題，包含所謂國界問題，必須在「對德第一」口號下加强三國的合作。</p>
<p>但是，英美對蘇聯却具有極大的戒心，關於開闢西綫問題之「冒險行動」，固然未肯輕於滿定蘇聯的要求，即如所謂物質援助，也始終保持一定的限度，時時保持其「養虎」的警惕心理。同時因為對於社會主義制度今後發展的驚懼，更不能不在今日就提出戰後秩序問題。至於對巴爾幹，地中海，波羅的海及近東中東諸國問題，更須在防制蘇聯活動的前提之下，要求「從長計議」。特別引起英美對蘇危懼而亟思抑制的是：　蘇聯對已爾幹的活動，　蘇聯境內波蘭軍隊組織的發展，　蘇聯參加地中海混合委員會後紅色勢力在非洲等地的伸展，　蘇聯與土耳其及近東中東諸小國關係的新發展；　蘇聯在境內組織「自山德國」政權機構與英美政策之矛盾等等。所有這些問題，要求在這次會議中獲得初步的解決，否則，戰爭期中的加强團結也談不到，更不用說職後的繼續合作了。</p>
<p>三國會議是否能够解決道些問題呢？就是最樂觀的反軸心國的　察家，恐怕也有難下論斷之感吧！不過有幾件事實，却是着實使英美感到頭痛的，第一，是蘇聯一直到現在獨立牽制着二百師之衆的德國大兵團，因此，不能不承認蘇聯在會議上之最强大的發言權；何况，所謂德蘇議和可能性的謠傳，也使羅邱之流聽到了不免心驚肉跳呢！其次，蘇聯夏季攻勢的某種程度的勝利，對於蘇聯在國際舞台上的聲望，以及其在對英美外交中的地位，顯然是相當有利的。英美在這方面，却不能不相形見絀。在這種事實前，誠如十月七日日本西部朝日新聞所說：「跟着東綫的進展，而恐懼蘇聯外交壓迫增加的英美，首先從事緩和這壓力，在形式上自不惜卑辭而厚禮」。若然，則三國會議的前途，似乎可以「不言而喩」了。</p>

<h3>日海軍航空部隊　長驅轟炸阿圖島　新幾內亞敵艦艇亦遭襲擊</h3>
<p>太平洋日　某基地十六日中央社電　日海軍機隊十四日下午曾長驅空襲阿圖島，衝破敵軍防空十字砲火，對其陸上各種軍事施設投彈　炸，使起火焚燒後，全機安返。途中並與敵戰鬥機相遭遇，敵機未及迎戰，即倉皇遁走。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城十六日中央社電　據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部十五日發表稱：日軍機隊曾攻新幾內亞島之　　　及芬希哈罕之反軸心　陣地。</p>
<p>各地日軍一週戰况</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據此間軍事權威方面談，自十月八日起至十四日止，日軍作戰情形稱：北千島方面仍無變化。（中國方面）　陸地戰爭，華北日軍自九月中旬以來，即在華北各地對共軍展開秋季攻勢，截至五日止，已收獲莫大戰果，計　滅共軍設施約三百四七所，共軍遺屍約九千具，被俘四千五百十七人，日軍截獲軍火被服糧秣等甚多，目下正在擴大戰果中。至華中日軍，則在五湖附近猛攻渝軍，戰爭極為順利，截至十二日止，渝軍遺屍約一千八百具，被俘四百五十人，日軍截獲大批軍火彈藥，此外日軍並擊滅渝忠義救國軍根據地，予以重創。又確保長江下游之豐饒三角地帶，目下日軍正在肅淸渝軍敗殘中　空戰，十月上旬敵機曾六次來　日軍陣地，前後使用飛機二十九架，惟日方幾無損害。（越南方面）滇越邊境渝軍動向，益無變化，惟十月八日有敵B34P50P38型飛機數架，來襲河內地區，旋即被日軍高射砲擊退，且受重創，日軍並無損害，僅傷居民數人，綜計十月上旬敵機來襲七次，前後共使用飛機約一百十架，被日方擊落七架。（緬甸方面）　陸地戰爭，八日拂曉，有敵艦艇六艘，載敵軍約二百人來犯孟多，日軍守備隊當　迎擊，經激戰後，將其擊滅，又滇緬國　方而淪軍，亦圖出動，日軍為先發制人，巳於十月上旬開始行動，巳將各處渝軍擊退。　空戰。敵　之空襲緬甸邊境日趨激烈，惟每次均被日機及地上部隊擊退，十月八日有敵B24　飛機十架及P38型飛機二架，來襲仰光，被日機擊落五架，（內右一架尙未證實）。又十日九日敵戰鬥機四架來襲芒市，亦被日方地上部隊擊落一架，十月十日晨敵機二架來仰光近郊，被擊落二架，又是日敵戰鬥機六架來襲　陵附近，被日軍擊落一架，是晚敵B24型機三架來襲仰光，亦被擊落一架，倉惶遁走，十四日復有敵B24型機十一架再襲仰光，當被擊落一架（澳北班藤方面）九日晨敵機六架來襲達　巴爾達島，日機當即升空迎擊，擊落其二架，日方亦有二架自炸。（所羅門方面）　陸地戰爭，敵軍有力部隊於六月三十日在倫特巴島及其他地點登陸以後，該方面日軍即與敵反覆搏　，歷三日之久，予敵重創。敵陣亡者，計在新佐治亞島方面，有一萬三千人以上，阿倫特爾島方面　一千人以上，合計一萬五千人以上。日軍於十月上旬向可倫班加拉島及培拉拉培拉島，向後方基地撤退時，並未受敵軍之任何妨害。　空戰，十月上旬所羅門方面來襲敵機，計共有一〇六　，日軍擊落其中三十七架（內有八架係被日軍地　砲火　擊落），日機未歸還者一架。　新幾內亞方面）　陸地戰爭，日軍刻在芬希哈罕四方地　與　空部隊緊密協力，繼續　敵激戰中。　空戰，日空軍於十日晚空襲　希哈罕附　，在克列泰角地區炸沉敵大汽艇三艘，另有二艘中彈起火，並轟炸芬　哈罕附近敵軍需儲藏庫，使其發生大火。又日　空襲桀特角東岸時、有一彈落在一敵船之近傍，十一日日機繼續突襲桀格河南方地區高射砲兵陣地，有八處中彈起火，十二日晚轟炸芬希哈罕附近敵登陸部隊，有一處被炸起火，又敵機於本週曾四次來襲，敵機共計二十餘架，其中被日機擊落者四架。</p>
<h3>汪主席電賀　洛勒爾總統</h3>

<h3>緬甸方面日軍　分數路推進　印度邊境英集中兵力</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午三時發表，渝軍企圖奪囘緬甸，現於中國西南方集中兵力，緬甸方面帝國陸軍部隊即制其發動，先於前月上旬自騰越及密芝那方面開始攻擊，刻仍到處擊破渝軍，向前推迆中。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵軍為於雨季進攻奪回緬甸展開總攻，自東南亞反軸心軍總司令官蒙特巴頓抵新德里後，即積極充實戰備，加强對緬甸之盲炸，並於緬印國境第一綫集結兵力約十師，企圖乘機進犯。本月八日曾有敵兵二百為偵察日軍實力，以舟艇十六艇企圖侵入孟多，已被殲滅，同時，渝軍陳誠部下之緬甸遠征軍，以昆明為根據，亦與此呼應，自杜聿明所率第五集團軍，關麟　之第九集團軍，宋希濂之第十一集團軍中抽出十餘師團，企圖自雲南進至北部緬甸。該方面之日陸軍部隊，於是月上旬為即予渝軍一致命打擊，乃自雲南邊境之騰越及密芝那方面分數路進攻，到處擊漬渝軍，突破高黎茸大雪兩山天險，刻仍以怒　之勢猛進中。該方面淪軍為急謀解決國內物資之不足，欲自雲南之保山，經騰越，密芝那開設通遠印度北部阿薩密州之新公路，現該方面集結之渝軍，已不使用蘇聯製之武器，全為美國製裝備，於笑軍將校指揮下，擬開始蠢動，然突遭日軍猛擊，使其夢想終成泡影。該地帶因有高黎茸大雪山山脈之險路及怒江之激流，故建設新路須橫跨潮濕地帶始能抵達印度之阿薩密州，即無日軍攻擊，工程亦極困難，今渝方之內情，實有不堪言狀。</p>

<h3>歐戰局轉變後　蘇土關係微妙　土駐蘇大使抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　莫斯科息：新任土耳其駐蘇大使巴杜爾，於星期五抵達莫斯科，到站歡迎者有土使館館員，與蘇聯外交委員　表等。</p>
<p>伊斯坦布十六日中央社電　自歐洲戰局發生轉變以來，蘇士關係更趨微妙，土政界人士，以英美蘇三國外長會談，及地中海委員會行將舉行，故對蘇聯之動向極為關心，　傳蘇士兩國軍隊曾在　境發生衝突，但經調査結果，證明此說完全子虛，　認今後蘇土關係，　更　緊張，其理由有三：　東　蘇軍作戰較前轉佳，並在克里米亞半島登陸，預料蘇軍在黑海水域之活動，將更趨積極　蘇聯乘其軍事情勢之順利，對達達尼爾海峽及土國權利，極圖染指，最近蘇聯一部份報組，竟公　攻擊土　之中立政策，土政府則亦藉各報社評，闡明土國中立政策之不變快意，故預料蘇聯今後將加倍壓迫土國。　英　對蘇土關係之緊張，似置之不理，因此英土關係最近亦漸趨冷淡，土國認英美蘇三國之關係，水火不相容，極難全面和解。又最近反軸心國成立地中海委員會，其任務不明，故土國政界對蘇方派外次維辛斯其等代表出入，出席該委會會，實巳表明蘇方對地中海之企圖，故對此憂慮不已。</p>
<h3>基輔兩面德軍　作猛烈反攻　尼維爾區戰事轉寂</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德軍於十五日反攻，猛烈擊退向基輔東南面及北面所進攻之敵軍，擊毀敵方坦克車五十九輛。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員塞托里斯稱：目前蓶軍攻勢之二大重心，在　輔　之大聶伯河　與亞索夫海之間，蘇軍在二地進攻兵力愈增愈强，路在重大犧牲之下略獲進展，但仍未能完成其大規模之突破企圖，德軍退出柴普魯基，對聶伯河下游與克里米亞間三星期來之戰爭，幷無決定性之影響。蓋柴魯魯基乃德軍在聶伯河迤東橋頭保之一，本在掩護北進之德軍側翼，早已料及蘇軍對之將施猛攻，事實上柴普魯基距離沿河主要防綫甚遠，德軍駐守在該處，乃在迎擊蘇軍進攻部隊之頭陣，此一目的在最近三星期內實現。　軍現已在伐萊河切斷敵軍，早在該河西岸布就堅强陣地，現可迎頭痛擊進攻之敵軍矣。蘇軍在柴波洛　迤南諾加斯基草原之入口處海台爾堡迤西及梅里托波爾等地，亦未能遂其突破之願，僅獲局部突入德軍陣地，蘇軍向梅立托波爾東段推進之先頭部隊，現已遭遇德軍强有力之反攻，該處現仍在苦戰中。基輔方面蘇軍一再自該城迤北與東南之橋頭堡以重兵實施進攻，但均遭吾軍反攻所擊退，巳受遏阻，敵在基輔區所施之壓力仍，重大，最近二日之苦戰，勢將持續下去，聶伯河其他各段，德軍在四岸　獲掃除敵軍據點各處，德軍並加緊對蘇軍貝里貝特橋頭堡之壓力，戈梅爾戰局無變化，敵在斯　倫斯克明斯克公路奧　迤東　　進攻，被吾軍予以重創擊退，尼　爾區戰事現已轉趨沉寂</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據前綫消悉：蘇軍於猛烈之砲火準備後，昨日以强大之步兵及坦克步隊，自聶伯河橋頭堡猛攻克雷門楚地區，現正在　職中。</p>
<h3>蘇聯更易　農業委員長</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　莫斯科通訊社昨稱：蘇聯人民農業委員長已由戈斯納　夫繼任，前任委員長夏洛　之名並未提及，何時述職亦從未疋式宣布。按該委員長所管轄區域，乃蘇聯最重要之農產區，此次領袖之調動，或係收穫準備不當之故。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　美空軍十四日下午空襲法蘭克福東方八十公　之斯溫　特時，曾喪失飛機百三十九架。據倫敦來電、美軍第八轟炸機　司令官安德森，對此次美機損害仍施其欺瞞慣技，僅發表損失六十二架，尤稱早日預　本年必有損害，故此次喪失多數飛機　實不足驚異。但據華　頓來電，美總統羅斯福十五日於接，記者時，曾率直承認戰敗，謂美空軍若每日如此損失，前途實不　設想。參加轟炸之美軍駕駛員等稱：德軍地上砲火極為猛烈，且德空軍戰鬥機隊於美機到達目的地　一小時半，即已飛起迎擊，故轟炸時極感辣手。德國通訊社空軍記者哈林斯萊賓，所此次空戰論述德國新戰術稱：參加此次轟炸之美機，總數約三百架，約被德軍擊落半數，美軍誇稱重裝甲之空中要塞杞繼作為灰燼，推算駕駛員至少陣亡千二百人，機關槍喪失一千七百挺以上，德軍得獲此大戰果，原因之一即為强化防空裝備之結柔。據於慕尼克附近着陸之美航空員稱：德軍於此次空戰中，曾使用火箭烟幕彈，至於該種烟幕彈具有如何裝備及性質，德軍當局則未說明。</p>
<h3>德機襲英</h3>

<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：德政界方面對保加利亞外長之更迭，並不重視。德外部發言人昨稱：此項變動為基洛夫抱恙後當然之結果，新任外長希許曼洛夫，在外交界服務素有經唸，並為德國之老友。</p>

<h3>斯溫福特空戰　德軍使用「鑲嵌戰術」　美喪失大批飛行堡壘</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據海通社航空訪員齊怕林稱：德國軍界方面息，星期四飛越德國境內之飛行堡壘，被擊落者幾及半數，空襲斯溫福特之美國轟炸機三百架被毀者達一百三十九架，德國防空之成功由於二端：　德軍使用最新之「鑲嵌戰術」。　空防之增强，所謂「鑲嵌戰術」係將集團之空戰分散為個別作戰，其間敵機一一被攻，德軍此次對飛行堡壘之勝利，為敵方在此次戰事中最大之挫敗。美國轟炸機飛打極高，井右長程戰鬥機之保議，但當自海岸飛近目標時，即遭無數襖機之攔截，　機專擇轟炸機為攻擊之對象，敵戰鬥機竟無能為力，美轟炸機遂致漬不成隊，遭遇重大之損失。一部份敵機雖能抵達斯溫福特之目的地，惟因隊伍不整，未能作有力之襲擊，美國空軍於一日之內除損失大量之飛機外，更損失空軍人員一千四百名，機關槍約一千七百架，故美駐英空軍自十月一日以來之損失，較所能補充者更為重大。</p>
<h3>伏爾托諾河北　激戰進行中</h3>
<p>甘波巴索市德軍撤退</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：英·美大軍渡越伏爾托諾河，於星期二在該河北岸獲得立足點兩處，德軍星期四對敵軍橋頭發動猛攻，進入敵軍陣地，英·美軍即於是日下午以大量之步兵與坦克車隊，進攻伏爾托諾河兩岸之德軍前哨陣地。德國軍界方面稱：英·美軍之進攻，固在意料中，現激戰仍在進行中。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德軍當局十五日發表稱：南義德軍十四日夜將甘波巴索市（Camqobass。那不勒斯東北五十英里）重要軍事設施破壞後，已自該市撤退，美加聯軍殲滅該市德軍之企圖，已完全失敗。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員稱：德軍司令部於義南戰事發生之初，即探取拖長戰綫使英。美軍進攻之戰略，而德軍所配置之兵力，則在予敵軍可能之損失。最近二日之戰略，證明已獲實現，此一戰略如十五日德軍戰報所載，最近二日敵曾以一優勢」部隊進攻德軍之前哨陣地，該處僅有少數德軍駐守，德軍主力幷未與之交戰，遂使亞歷山大無從探明德軍主力究將於何時與何地與之交戰。但前哨陣地所守之德軍，皆為精銳部隊，旣可牽制敵軍之兵力，復可消耗其實力，故敵軍奪取德軍前哨陣地之戰事，現仍在全力進行中，因此美第五軍自伏爾托諾北岸推進之左　巳見展緩。英軍在伏爾托諾迤北茄達灣所登陸之部隊，遭遇德軍堅强抵抗，亦未能改變該處戰局。卡浦亞區敵軍壓力甚强，美第五軍在卡浦爾迤北山區之右　，現正向米萊托文契亞托洛推進，進攻兵力愈演愈强。英第八軍之左翼則在奪取德軍古聖尼亞之前哨陣地及康波巴索東北之德軍陣地，英軍僅在蒂摩里與伐斯托之問，幷無重大活動，業高茂萊顯已將其右翼軍隊調往左翼作戰。</p>

<h3>菲律賓產業概况一瞥</h3>
<p>菲島今在遂行大東亞戰爭的過程上，負起新的使命與希望，而踏上光榮獨立的軌道。在地理上，菲島是大東亞圈的中心，在資源上，是南方諸地域中最大量出產國防資源的地方。新菲島將來的發展性，誠大可矚望。除鑛物資源以外，更擁有豐富的椰乾核，麻，棉等重要資源。因着今後的開發進展，大東亞共榮圈之一環的菲島，負起了極重要的任務。</p>
<p>那麼今後菲島經濟應向何種方向進行呢？其一，乃遂行戰爭上有直接關係的增强戰力資源之確保，其二、以菲島經濟為中心而成為共榮圈經濟之一環的開發產業。前者有銅，錳，鑛等鑛物資源，後者有椰乾核，麻，棉，木材，油脂等。在另一方面，國內食糧問題，和治安問題，同在產業開發上有極大影響，而被要求着從速解決。在食糧對策上，確立島民所常食的米穀的自給體制，當局在農業各方面加以徹底的再檢討，生產目標預定為六千三百八十五萬卡盆（一卡盆終四斗一升），在「五年增產計劃」之下，積極進行整備，為提高生產量的起見，每年劃出〇〇萬預算，用作灌漑，排水的設備優良品種的增殖，耕作法之改良，自給肥料之增產及休閑地之利用等，日菲農業關係者，打成一片，向增產邁進。以下再就戰爭資材並成為經濟之中心的產業個別看其進展狀態。</p>
<p>鑛業</p>
<p>在南方占領地內，調査完畢鑛業資源，埋藏最豐富者推菲島為首位，且其前途大有希望。一九四〇年，菲島的鑛山總數為八十所，鑛產額九千二百六十二萬比（菲島幣名），其中金鑛業占全體的八五％，計七千六百八十三萬比，銀鑛業一百九十八萬比、　鑛業四百萬比，船十一萬八千比，　二百六十一萬比，鐵五十六萬比，錳一百四十二萬比。說菲島鑛業是金鑛業。並非過言。然大東亞戰爭爆發以後，必然的有所轉變，而其重心從金鑛業移至銅，鐄，錳等。因此，如金銀鑲等與戰爭和直接關係的鑛業，必然加以整理，而以其剩餘機械力移甲於重要鑛業。鑛山總數原有八十所，經整理僅〇〇所，置於軍管理下，順利地運營着。</p>
<p>農業</p>
<p>菲島的農業，向來即有比較順利的發達，但自米穀以次的主要食糧，大多仰給於海外的輸入，這是致命的缺陷。今後隨着共榮圈經濟體制的確立，尙須再加調整。</p>
<p>麻</p>
<p>馬尼剌麻年產約〇〇萬噸。島內需要約〇〇萬噸，剩下的〇〇萬噸，可向日本及共榮圈各地輸出。現在該項物資當作造船　劃中，及織物，製帽，製紙等的原料，其需要大見增加。今後南方共榮圈內麻的供給。決定由菲島一地供給，因而菲島的麻具有重大意義。當局為增產起見，與以種種便利，為雜持市價，改良耕種及生產方法而從事收買及調整價格等工作，一面並謀製麻機械力的增加，把　在各地的工廠移駐於泰巴奧，集中收集，製造，運輸三部面，用全力經營，向增產路上邁進。</p>
<p>椰乾核</p>
<p>和馬尼剌麻同為菲島重要產業而占重要位置的是椰乾核。椰乾核在菲島有着世界首屈一指的產額，以前約四百萬人的島民，賴斯業以生活。資源極為豐富，且各地的小產業因係個人投資經營，在島民的經濟生活上，有極大影響，因而在把握民心上，亦有極大意義。種植面積約〇〇萬英畝，樹木數約〇〇千株，椰乾核生產額約〇〇萬噸。現在以日本作為中心，而廣泛地運至共榮圈各地。椰乾核的增產，有賴於搜集的圓滑運用者極大，為謀有力的一元的統制收買，設置「菲島椰乾收買組合」，區分產地為數地區，規定各地負責收買量，而本年度所預定的收買量　突破〇〇萬噸。菲島椰乾核如能充分收買，則共榮圈的椰乾核需要，僅菲島即足夠供給。</p>
<p>以椰乾核為原料的油脂工業之發達，亦為當前急務。戰前用小規樓的機械力，年產椰子油三十萬噸，重油的代用燃料年產十八萬噸。為南方唯一的椰子油生產地。　在不僅止於製造椰子油，且亦着手製造硬化油，滑潤油等高級油脂。把馬尼刺近郊的各榨油工廠，遷至生產地的農村，　　向增强油脂工業邁進。</p>
<p>砂糖</p>
<p>在菲島農　上成為最重要的問題，而在今後的產業開發上有極大影響者是製糖事業。占以前菲島輸出總額的百分之四十，年產〇〇萬噸，每年國庫可收入約一億比以上。在砂糖產額約〇〇萬噸中，島內消費者約〇〇萬噸，其餘〇〇萬噸的輸出市塲，因戰爭而梗塞，　　的前途，勢必有所轉變。糖業的一部，在大東亞關經濟的計劃下，業已改為　作。</p>
<p>棉業</p>
<p>從砂糖轉至至棉作，在去年試騐期間成績，克服一切不良條件而獲得相當成功。在土地條件上但雖無議論的餘地，但欲完成〇〇萬擔的五年計劃，在技術指導上尙須費一番苦心。但在第一年度上，在土地改良，耕作技術的指導，優良品種的培育，害蟲除　等各方面，巳獲得　　的經騐，而有所改進，整備各種必須條件，本年度的棉花栽培，早已實施，而預定確保紡棉收獲量〇〇萬擔，　本年度日本人技術者亦大見增加，業巳超過百名，硏究和土地條件相一致的耕作對策，預先算定　魃，雨期的時期並預防方法，以期萬全。</p>
<p>紡　　業的發展亦在計劃中，因日本國內紡織事業的整理而剩　的。正積極遷至菲島。現在業已遷移了〇〇萬錠，和當地的機械設備併合起來，完成有力的工廠，在　　　　　　的需要上，匪島　　的栽培，將有極大自獻，此外，匪島有希望的產業是木材，水產業，木材以明遠　島為中心，千英畝的森林地帶，戰爭勃發後，常運至日本國內作為交換物　，在，（翔　譯自十月八日　　報知）</p>

<h3>殺人犯湯榮昌　昨執行絞決</h3>
<p>住居梵皇渡路（舊極司斐爾路）嚴家宅三十二號門牌，業猪腸之高企農，因不運公會規章，於收買出賣猪腸時，恒將售價减低，致其他腸業之營業，頗受影響，遂遭人之忌，民國三十年七月二十一日淸晨，突有暴徒多人，侵入高家開槍，將高及其妻擊斃，及至三十一年始經前公共捕房弋獲是案兇犯無鍚人湯榮昌（現年三十四歲）一名，解由前特一法院訊判，處以死刑，業經確定聽候執行，茲上海地方檢察　接奉司法行政部指令，着將　犯定期執行，昨晨經地檢署將湯犯由上海監獄提出，押解至上海監獄第二分監外刑塲，由檢察官訊問年籍後，即騐明正身，依法執行絞決。</p>
<h3>煤球現貨缺乏　購得頗不易　燃料恐慌亟應加以調整</h3>
<p>居民每日不可或缺之必需燃料煤球。近一週來，益感缺乏，居民因不易購得　頗有被迫停炊之虞。故一　　　當局，予以一秉初衷，即日派員澈查眞相，調整供應狀况，僉以晚近零星煤球雖不易購得，反之，各製造廠對於直接用戶仍照常車送，同時居民因急於解除燃料恐慌，爰向黑市添購，聞每担價格，較諸標準限價，高出一倍有餘。昨據熟諳煤球市况者告稱：目前各製造廠製造煤球眞正原料（白煤屑）僅及五成，其中三成係煤渣之類，二成即為黃泥，故燃燒火力顯然大見減退，第用以製造煤球之白煤屑，存底猶相常充沛，來源亦蟬聯於途，均由關係常局按期配給，但目前竟發生無貨應市之局而，殊出人意外。</p>
<h3>市宣傳處昨召開　首次記者例會　商討各項市政問題</h3>
<p>中央社訊　市宣傳處前為增進本市各報一社記者對於市政設施情况，新聞　道力求翔實起　，於昨日上午十時，在市府二樓會議室，舉行第一次新聞記者例會，各報　　者出席者，計有松平九州　，（同盟社）程一平，（中央社）蔣　　，（中華日報）劉漢　，（申報）栗之　保，　崎國雄，（大陸新　）唐雄風，（平報）　由之，（新聞　）各機關代表出席者，計有　煥祥，（第三警察局保甲辦事處）許鳴　，（工務局）沈驊，（滬西警察局）周希黃（糧食局）陳九峰，（一區保　　員會）粗鐵漢，（公用局）金平山，（市保甲委員會）徐　榮，（第二警察局）魏仲恭，（財政局）等以及該處梁處長秀予，秘書江其　等共二十餘人，由梁處長主席，首致問會　，略謂今日之記者例會，係根據上次舉行之市政新聞報道聯絡會議所決定，自宣傳處成立以來，力求與各報社取得密切聯絡，同時各報社為謀市政新聞報道來源正確與迅速，亦希望宣傳處舉行記者例會，事前由各報社提出市政問題，由宣傳處與各機關聯絡，派代表出席答覆，務使人民明瞭市政設施方針云云，　即由各機關代表依次答覆各項問題如下：</p>
<p>現行保甲問題</p>
<p>（申報問現行之保甲區域如何？一，八兩區保甲處之組絹如何？保甲　為警察局之隸屬機關，抑係平行機關？市民所組織之　甲委員會，其職權　圍如何？一區自警團與八區民警　　値崗選拔各方面，均有差別，　故何在？（第一八區保甲委員會答）關於保甲區城及　　局之地位關係可作答如下：向例從　　　租界內　七區，虹口另立一海軍保甲區，市區方面為市　　西　區，屬於市保甲委員會，租界收囘後，第一區保甲機　，直屬於第一警察局之保甲處，八區方面另設保甲分　事處，關於市民組織之保甲委員會職權問題，民　　織之保甲委員會，其名稱為保甲指導委員會，　執行機關，係保甲之咨詢機關。關於一八兩區自　　與民警團，服務不同間　，一區規定較為嚴格，凡年自二十歲至四十五歲無殘疾者，均屬値崗，而八區規定須自二寸五歲起至三十五　為止，且因輪値者又經抽進，故不仝輪到，此種情形，自有輕重之分，八區保甲自經保甲處　分辦事處管理後，漸有　整之趨勢。如有不衰份子，藉保甲之名而有魚肉人民之行　，望隨時檢舉，務使保甲組織健全，而達　　地方治安之目的。</p>
<p>配給米糧問題</p>
<p>（平報問）　市實行計口授　以來，價格　　，而較量　减，且公布時對於米質往往有「或白　或糙米或碎米」等不明劃不　定之詞句，足授米店以舞弊之機會，上述為民食　途之重要問題。最短期間有無改善方法？（糧食局答）米糧分配减少，因交通運輸不能通暢，而運費之增加，亦為米糧增價之原因，關於米質問　及分配數量，屬諸米糧調整委員會，且因棧單上並無註明，出米後臨時始能照米分配，市區方而向例須各米店對白米糙米碎米，依照公布明白發售，至於上述情形，大槪是一八兩區所有之現象，而一八兩區配米之權，不屬糧局關於價格及數量，則正力圖改善中。</p>
<p>拆除鐵門問題</p>
<p>（平報問）市區與前租界毗連處之鐵門，初傳全部拆除，繼傳全部開放，嗣傳增　數門，但迄今無一實行，此項鐵門，亟應全部拆除，庶觀感一新方便交通，市政當局對此將採如何之措置？（工務局答）拆　以前市區與租界交界鐵門問題，當租界　收囘時工務局於七月底曾計劃準傭拆除，後以警　方面，認為目前警防治安關係，以不拆除為佳。</p>
<p>電車貫通問題</p>
<p>（平報問）大東亞戰爭發生後，上海公共交通工具大為减少，市民打的問題，殊為嚴重，此於各路電車之擁擠可以覘之，今後對此點，有無改善的準備：一八兩區之電車，以前各路均得貫通，今幾全部各止於　境，兩區電車之貫通，足予市民以不少之便利，今　究能恢復全部貫通之辦法否？南市人口近已增多，而公共交通工具，尙付缺如，電車之恢復，或以材料缺乏，一時不能實現，但公共木炭汽車之行駛，無多大困難，今後南市公共交通有恢復可能否！（公用局答）關於一八兩區電車貫通問題，公用局曾於收囘租界時，即與電車公司洽商，已先恢復一部份，現十八路廿四路均巳貫通兩區，　十七路六路五路十二路，暫時尙不能恢復原狀，關於南市行駛公共汽車問題，固物資缺之，並因種種困難，在南市行駛公共汽車，一時恐難實行。</p>
<h3>三省二市紙類搬運　無須申請許可　運往華南華北須經核准</h3>
<p>上海社記者昨向商統會方面探悉，關於各種紙類搬運自上海運往三省二市，已無須向商統會申請許可，如運往華南華北等處，　應先得到各地官署之搬入許可，然後再向商統會物資移動許可事務所申請搬出，否則絕對不准私自搬運。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>改善交通</h3>
<p>昨天市民福利會會員大會，中有請求改善交通之建議案。按交通事業，原以便利行旅為主要目的，如果行旅而　感不便，則交通事業成績的　窳，慨可想見。</p>
<p>僅就京滬　　　鐵路交通而言，在廿六年事變以前，兩路辦理完善，行旅　便，几行經兩路旅客　能道之，而目前該兩路交通情形如何，不待親自旅行始覺痛苦，即　往北站巡視，排隊擁擠，爭先恐後，　奪吵架等種種混亂現象，宛如一幅亂離圖。在此情况之下，支付代價而引導强擠者有之，轉瞬間行李不翼而飛者亦有之。</p>
<p>本年春間，我們曾為行旅呼籲，請求交通當局予以改善，嗣經當局逐漸整頓，各界與論咸有好評。無如不久又復舊觀。我們對於交通當局的獻言，實已至詳至盡，而其初當局之能俯順與情，亦可欽佩。惜乎尙少持之以恒的堅毅精神，因有目前每况愈下之現象。</p>
<p>我們鄭重的複述：「交通事業，以便利行旅為主要目的。」亟盼交通當局隨時隨地嚴切注意與講求達此目的之方法。如果華中鐵道公司的力量微薄，無法全部整頓，則市政當局與各有關方面以及社會團體，也應協助解決，絕對不能熟視無睹而任　旅客痛苦。我們認為交通事業不能為旅客便利而服務，乃是現代國家之恥辱。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>提倡化學工業</h3>
<p>第三次東亞經濟北京懇談會，自九月二十七日起，在北京中南海懷仁堂舉行，其特別成為討論之問題者。乃在如何打開增產之狹路，而關於華北之化學工業一點，似尤値得華中人士策勵。說到化學工業，以用鹽作原料之蘇打及酸類工業為中心，可　出玻璃，油類，製藥，　　，造紙等工業。可是，此等工業在華北之發展，實比其他工業為遲，蓋由於電力，資材，資金之不足，所以在會議中，有人强調主張設置化學工業審議機關，「頗惹注目。」</p>
<p>何以化學工業特別値得華中人士的策勵？第一，化學工業在華中是已經有了相當基礎的，發揚光大起來，在　實上比較輕而易舉，其次，化學工業所需要的三個基本條件—電力，資材，資金，—在華中是不成問題的，祇是要看我們如何去發揮這幾個條件，蓋以配合化學工業方面之需要。以電力而言，「上海方面各電廠之總發電量，約在二十萬KVA以上，可是，工業用電，仍感不　，化學工業，自亦不在例外。亟常加以調整，藉以補助化學工業動力的不足，以資材，即原料，而言，化學工業之是初原料旣為用鹽，而鹽本為華中一帶最富饒的天然產物，則原料一層，祇在於如何解決供應問題，否則連食鹽都要發生問題，　論化學工業之原料？至以資金而言哺華中，尤其是上海，有的是資金，祇在於如何增强社會人士對於化學工業之認識，使其多多投資於化學工業一途。藉為社會人羣造福。觀於　來一般投資者對於新藥與造紙等工業股票所感覺的興趣，則此項認識，似已顯有進步了！</p>
<h3>京滬綫棉產不豐　售價逐步遞增</h3>
<p>本年新棉業已登塲，京滬路沿綫如太倉江陰等產棉區域新花業已上市，在棉紗布未經政府收買時，花價激漲，後因紗布跌價，花價隨之低落，在兩月前每担　跌去一半。最近商統會棉業部實行統制收買棉花，該會當局為保障農民利益，不願將花價過份抑低，於是疲不能興之花價，漸　轉機之象，迄於今日大倉江陰各產棉區域，去籽新花於登塲之始，售價即升，其後逐步遞增甚連。據棉業中人觀測今年棉花盛放之際，因値颶風吹折頗多，故收成不甚　稔、是以新花售價，後市續有高漲趨勢。</p>
<h3>中儲主辦　獎勵儲蓄週</h3>
<p>（南京十六日中央社電）中儲銀行以値此大東亞戰爭期間，為提高國人儲蓄報國意識起見，特主辦獎勵儲蓄週，聯合南京市內所有各銀行銀號錢莊同時舉辦，茲聞已定自本年十月十八日起至卅一日止為獎勵儲蓄兩週間，凡於是週期間內前往該行或各銀行銀號錢莊等有定期存欵在五百元以上者『除給有優原利息外，並有得獎五萬元之希望。</p>

<p>近二三年來，由於商人的囤積，操縱，造成了上海畸形繁榮的局面，一切娛樂，都趨向低級物慾精神的享受，舞塲，咖啡　，大飯店的　立，如雨後春筍，因此產生了一大批「花」呀，「月」呀的歌曲，更藉着無綫电的　送，和曲選的流通，竟深入各階層，在路上，弄內，隨處可以聽到一個苦力或至一個八九歲的孩子，哼着什麽「哥呀哥」，「妹呀妹」的歌詞，這非但消沉一般國民的志氣，而且影響到少國民的敎養，如果這種歌曲再讓他存在下去，　續發展其勢力，民族前途實在不堪設想，未知當局亦曾注意及否？（斯人）</p>
<p>提倡民衆音樂</p>
<p>音樂與民　，具有極大的關係，樂記上　說過：「夫民有血氣和知性而　哀樂之常，應感起物而動，然後心術形焉，是故　志噍殺之音作，而民思憂，嗶喈慢易繁文簡節之音　，而民康樂，粗厲猛起奮末廣　之音作，而民剛毅，廉直勁正莊滅之音作，而民肅敬，　裕內好順成和動之音作，而民　　，流辟邪敬狄成滌　之音作，而民淫亂。…」</p>
<p>然而現在上海的音樂，無論電影揷曲，或各歌舞塲所的流行歌曲，莫不趨向於享樂主義，而皆以男女私情為主；於是道途所　，不論是行人隨口哼哼，或是商店裏　音機所放送的，全是音樂及時，郞呀妹呀的軟件歌曲，習慣成自然，於是一般民衆大家都拿享樂主義作前提，安於逸樂，習於因循，以致富者繁　浮華，窮者爾欺我詐，靑年子弟墜落放縱，迷戀於歌台舞　，沉溺於聲色犬　，於是學者不務實學，　　文憑到手，則敲門磚喜已在　，商人惟利是圖，囤積居　，，　腰　之常肥，千金一擲，萬貫買笑，其經營歌舞塲所者，亦皆表新取異，爭相以聲色為餌；　其巾者，美色奪其目，　曲充其耳，共他一切不聞不問，至若政府之苦口高呼，　論之勸導指謫，又安能入其耳目。而愓其身心哉？馬賽革命歌，法國革命得以成：霓裳羽衣曲，唐代宗室險及亡，為當局者，實不容忽視之，加以當今非常時期，一國之存亡，實繫於民氣之盛衰，所以戰時音樂，想決不會為賢明的當局所漠視的。</p>
<p>戰時國家，而無　時情緒，這是政府和人民　共引為可恥的事；毫無戰時情緒，而高言參戰，是自欺欺人更為可恥的事。」（見四月七日申報社評）</p>
<p>民氣頹荒，諸惡橫行，在這種情形之下，而欲高談富國强民，謀政治　濟入於正軌，眞是「遠矚千里之目而忘其眉睫。」高呼口號，滿貼標語，何能收效？好逸惡勞，人之常情，「民　使由之，」深望政府當局，澈底改革一切無聊軟　歌曲，而獎　及倡導戰時民衆音樂，以正民心而激發民氣，其他　樂塲所以及電影劇本戲情等，亦須加以　頓，務使有正常之娛樂塲所而無窮侈極奢的毀人窟，其應倡導的加以倡導，　革除的予以革　，勿以小惡　關大局而忽視，勿使上海成為一個橘　淮為枳的壞地方，如是新運得以　進，民心得以振作，復興國家，庶幾有望。（劉漢民）</p>
<p>麻雀與婦女娛樂</p>
<p>麻雀一事，有人以為是消遣，但是消遣的根本目的是在怎麽消磨有閒的時間，現在日以繼夜地連應安眠休息的時間都要放在消遣之中，其是否合理，不言自明。又有說這是娛樂，但是很　通的，往往雙方為了爭奪一張牌而掙得面紅耳赤，不歡而散，鑒此可如娛和樂之至如何程度。所以無論從消遣或娛樂方面看來，都不能說是有充分理由。更可痛心者，一般主婦們把小孩子交託奶媽，自已無不顧問，惟八　五　要緊；大一點的孩子，　在麻雀桌角上，指指點點，居然做起狗頭軍師，家　敎育究竟在那裏？不　輸錢，則但聽婦凳亂響，但　碗　亂飛，一腔怨氣，發揮得淋漓盡致，至於不認六親，鬧得家裏雞犬不寧，家庭和睦親愛又在那裏？種種惡態，　處可拾，長此以往，麻雀之和雅片，其沉淪國民有何異乎？家庭不健全，國家復興之基礎不立，國家富强永遠是在渺茫之中！</p>
<p>雖然，麻雀之能於今日深入民間，獲得普遍廣泛的勢力，其來有自，即以交際應酬而論，確是　單便利。有非此莫屬之概。因此，問題是不在麻雀本身，面在怎樣消滅因　麻雀所引發的罪惡，是怎樣納又麻雀入於正軌。我們所研究的對衆，亦僅以中上階級為限，尤其是中上階級的婦女，因為她們多數是空得沒有事做而以　麻雀作為她們所謂消遣娛樂的懶惰蟲。只要對她們有辨法，麻雀罪惡的消滅自可迎刃而解；至於想藉政府的力量以達到消滅麻雀罪惡的月的，是不可能，政府方面於此實是愛莫能助。所以惟一的辦法只有求之於自發的抑制—　否不顧自己的身體健康而日以繼夜？　否　　子女敎養而流連方域？是否値得犧牲家庭融洽的空氣，自已的前途，有為的光陰於　戰之中？種種問題在一個人坐下　麻雀的　　，都應該深切反省。（麻雀二小時同盟，應該寄予深切同情）。但是中上階級的婦女，即使是受過高深敎育的大太小姐，也何嘗有一刻考慮及此，實足為之痛哭治涕。如果這種婦女一日不能自制於麻雀，麻雀罪惡一日不能消滅！</p>
<p>根本解決，我們要改革婦女的思想，提倡婦女的技術，如針黹。　　，　結　綫等等。引導使有準確之思想和認識，手邊隨時有有益的工作，務使其不會也不　浪費許多時間於　麻雀之中。要達到這個目的，婦女敎育制度實有根本加以檢討的必要。婦女敎育之在今日成為婦女的裝飾品，實為不容諱言的事質。不當的叉麻雀　是婦女敎育陰暗的一面，今日在社會上獲得地位的少數婦女，決非是今日婦女敎育的成功，而是她們自己奮鬥的結果。我們的要求是改革婦女敎育制度。使之適合於現代國家及社會之需要，家庭之需要，敎會式的婦女敎育，貴族式的婦女敎育，都在揚棄之列！然後家庭幸福，國家復興，纔有希望。（大權）</p>

<p>戶口米摻雜，有礙市民健康、　有所聞，未見被害人發現，不料此禍竟發生於敝人家庭。綠小女十五歲，本月十一日，腸痛如絞，彼時疑係是痧，卽送醫院急診，詎料經醫生判定，是急性盲腸炎，非動手術不可，否則與生命有危險。彼時敝人當遵醫囑，開刀割去此盲腸，據云，盲腸中滿貯細砂石子。敝人追思此物之來源，不能不推想到近數期之戶口米。質地惡劣，甚望一般食　多加注意，更盼糧食當局顧及市民健康，配給糙米白米碎米均可，只求米質純粹，不可攙有細砂石子。</p>
<h3>赴外埠學生　領居住證困難</h3>
<p>某學生家中來函說明赴外埠學生領居住證困難情形：一個住在第八區的靑少年，因為到南京某中學讀書，上海戶口當然報出；但是南京的保甲辦法，和上海不同，無論通學生寄宿生，只要有一個學員證，到處通行無阻；不過學員證的有效期間，到學期結束時終了，回到上海，連忙照相，辦理申請居住證手續，經過好幾個星期，怕路上査居住證。大門必不敢出，總算領到居住證了，倒又要往南京開學；照保甲章程，離開上海三個月以上是要繳銷居住證報出的，想到那靑少年過了三個多月，又要放假囘來，那時沒有了上海居住證，不敢出門，不奸走路，倘是觸着霉頭，還要吃耳光，行裏去，罰錢事小，誤會事大，所以又不敢報出；不報出吧，又說是買領戶口米；（其實也不過每天一合米而已，）倘現在報出將來再報進吧，申請又這樣麻煩而領到居住證又這樣的緩慢，照相等費用又這樣貴，保甲處辦事還不嫌煩而保甲長却嫌討厭，不知保甲辦事人員也想到像這樣的事實，上海一定很多，可有補救辦法？</p>
<h3>棚戶的呼籲</h3>
<p>我是一個棚戶，（住在虹口到楊樹浦一帶的平房，此房　在舊租界以前造的和打理的房子，是不一收　捐票的總　棚戶）近日閱貴報登載肥皂火柴和食鹽，又實行配給，對於市民的負担减輕不少，但他發的購買證，是憑房捐票發的，對於我們棚戶並不提起，現在棚戶所配給的，只有米粉油（米粉證是區公所發的，油憑戶口證買的，）糖到現在還未配給，如果肥皂火柴食　，亦不配給，將來　　一樣，那時更受苦不能言了，因此三種必需品，每日不可缺少，比糖更為重要，如果無房捐票而不配給，像閘北區亦無房捐，　亦配給，購買證是保甲處發的，我們虹口區的棚戶，得不到同樣的配給，甲長，亦無效力，呌我們到何處去申請呢，應該請當局注意一下。（周　）</p>

<h3>On the Two-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>— Mu Gong</p>
<p>The tripartite conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is about to begin. As this world war enters a decisive stage, this political move by the anti-Axis powers is of significant and thought-provoking importance. There is no need to elaborate. I will now analyze the motives, themes, intentions of the three countries, and possible trends of the conference from an objective and impartial standpoint, in order to help the people of our country understand the international situation. Perhaps this will not be entirely without meaning.</p>
<p>The preparation for the tripartite conference dates back to the Quebec Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill. At that time, Britain and the United States did not invite the Soviet Union to participate in the strategic meeting of the anti-Axis countries, and the Soviet side indicated that there was "no need to participate," which actually showed the "superficial unity and inner discord" of the anti-Axis countries. Therefore, at the close of the meeting, news spread that Roosevelt and Churchill were eagerly hoping to meet with Stalin in person in order to maintain the unity of the three countries in the anti-German war. However, considering the actual situation of the dispute, Roosevelt was unable to endure the hardships of going to Moscow, and Stalin clearly stated that he could not leave the Soviet territory. Therefore, it was proposed that a tripartite foreign ministers' conference should be held first, before the meeting of the three giants, in order to clarify some obstacles to strengthening wartime unity among the three countries and explore possible conditions for continued cooperation after the war, in order to find more appropriate countermeasures. Under the general premise of jointly opposing Germany, we will strengthen the cooperation of the three countries in the military, political, and economic fields. I think that although the ultimate goals of the three countries are different, the motives of this tripartite foreign ministers' conference are almost the same.</p>
<p>So, what issues will the US-British-Soviet conference discuss? From the perspective of the international war situation, perhaps all three parties have a demand for a unified strategy and coordinated operations? However, it seems that the participants in the meeting are all diplomatic figures. Obviously, this meeting will not touch on military affairs. Because, the Soviet Union is certainly unwilling to talk about the strategy in the Pacific, but Britain and the United States are afraid of hearing about the "blunders" of the second front again. Without discussing military affairs, and focusing on diplomacy, it is natural to discuss political issues. This is the core of this meeting. Except for the Soviet Union's silence, we have already heard various rumors and speculations. The most likely topics of this meeting will be: (A) issues related to the current diplomatic problems of the three countries, and (B) issues related to the post-war international order. As for the former, it includes the problems of the Balkan countries, the problems of the Near East and the Middle East, the problems of the three Baltic countries, the problems of Finland and Poland, and the problems of the Mediterranean, etc. These problems are interrelated and have complex relationships. As for the latter, it is fundamentally an illusory problem. Of course, judging by the urgency of the situation, the focus of this meeting seems to be on resolving current diplomatic problems and strengthening cooperation.</p>
<p>The countries participating in the meeting obviously have their own plans. Leaving aside the contradictions between Britain and the United States for the time being, in this meeting, the subtle relationship between the capitalist Britain and the United States and the socialist Soviet Union is also thought-provoking. Reports from Berlin and London said that the Soviet Union will make the following requests at this meeting: "The Baltic coastal countries will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; the eastern part of Poland up to the Curzon Line will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; Bessarabia will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; the borders stipulated in the Soviet-Finnish treaty after the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939 will be recognized; the Soviet Union's close mutual assistance with Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Iran." But the above items from to are actually the Soviet-Finnish borders set by the results of the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939 and the western borders of the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the German-Soviet War in 1941. In the Soviet Union, it cannot be regarded as a "request" or need to make a "request", but the British and American sides want to use "recognition" of this border as a bargaining chip in the negotiation. Therefore, the Soviet side has already declared a few days ago that "this meeting will not discuss border issues" in order to avoid unnecessary complications. Objectively speaking, what the Soviet Union hopes from Britain and the United States today is very clear, that is, concentrate all efforts to open up the Western Front, that is, the real second front; give the Soviet Union more and more substantial material assistance; abandon anti-Soviet activities in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Near East, the Middle East and other small countries; do not rush to discuss post-war issues during the war, including the so-called border issues, and must strengthen the cooperation of the three countries under the slogan of "Germany First".</p>
<p>However, Britain and the United States are very wary of the Soviet Union. Regarding the "risky actions" of opening up the Western Front, they are unwilling to lightly meet the Soviet Union's demands. Even the so-called material assistance has always maintained a certain limit, and they always maintain the vigilance of "raising a tiger". At the same time, because of the fear of the future development of the socialist system, they cannot but raise the issue of the post-war order today. As for the issues of the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, and the Near East and the Middle East, they must be considered "in the long term" under the premise of preventing Soviet activities. What particularly aroused the fear of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union and made them eager to suppress it is: the Soviet Union's activities in the Balkans; the development of the Polish army organization in the Soviet Union; the expansion of the red forces in Africa and other places after the Soviet Union joined the Mediterranean Mixed Committee; the new development of the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and the small countries in the Near East and the Middle East; the contradiction between the Soviet Union's organization of the "Free German" political institutions in the country and the policies of Britain and the United States, etc. All these issues require a preliminary solution at this meeting, otherwise, strengthening unity during the war is out of the question, let alone continued cooperation after the war.</p>
<p>Can the tripartite conference solve these problems? Even the most optimistic anti-Axis observers are afraid that it is difficult to make a judgment! However, there are a few facts that really make Britain and the United States feel a headache. First, the Soviet Union has been independently containing 200 divisions of the German army until now. Therefore, it is impossible not to recognize the Soviet Union's strongest voice at the meeting; what's more, the rumors of a possible German-Soviet peace treaty inevitably make Roosevelt and Churchill feel frightened! Secondly, the Soviet Union's victory to some extent in the summer offensive is obviously quite beneficial to the Soviet Union's prestige on the international stage and its position in diplomacy with Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States cannot but be eclipsed in this regard. In the face of this fact, as the Japanese Western Asahi Shimbun said on October 7, "Britain and the United States, fearing the increase in Soviet diplomatic pressure following the progress of the Eastern Front, first tried to ease this pressure, and they will not hesitate to use humble words and generous gifts in form." If so, the future of the tripartite conference seems to be "self-evident".</p>

<p>Weekly Battle Situation of Japanese Forces in Various Locations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a military authority here, the operational situation of the Japanese army from October 8 to 14 is as follows: There are no changes in the Northern Kuril Islands. (China) Land warfare: Since mid-September, the Japanese army in North China has launched an autumn offensive against the Communist army in various parts of North China. As of the 5th, great results have been achieved. Approximately 347 Communist facilities have been destroyed, approximately 9,000 Communist soldiers have been left dead, and 4,517 have been captured. The Japanese army has seized a large amount of military supplies, clothing, and food, and is currently expanding the results. The Japanese army in Central China is fiercely attacking the Chongqing army near the Five Lakes. The war is going very smoothly. As of the 12th, approximately 1,800 Chongqing soldiers have been left dead, and 450 have been captured. The Japanese army has seized a large number of military supplies and ammunition. In addition, the Japanese army has destroyed the base of the Chongqing Loyal National Salvation Army, inflicting heavy damage. In addition, the fertile delta in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been secured, and the Japanese army is currently clearing out the defeated remnants of the Chongqing army. Air warfare: In early October, enemy aircraft came to the Japanese army's positions six times, using a total of 29 aircraft. However, the Japanese suffered almost no damage. (Vietnam) There are no changes in the movements of the Chongqing army on the Yunnan-Vietnam border.

The Japanese suffered no damage, and only a few residents were injured. In total, enemy aircraft attacked seven times in early October, using approximately 110 aircraft. Seven were shot down by the Japanese. (Burma) Land warfare: At dawn on the 8th, six enemy ships carrying approximately 200 enemy soldiers attacked Maungdaw. The Japanese garrison fought back and annihilated them after a fierce battle. In addition, the Chongqing army on the Yunnan-Burma border also attempted to mobilize. The Japanese army, in order to take preemptive action, began operations in early October and has already repelled the Chongqing army in various places. Air warfare: Enemy air raids on the Burmese border are becoming increasingly fierce, but each time they are repelled by Japanese aircraft and ground forces. On October 8, ten enemy B-24 aircraft and two P-38 aircraft attacked Rangoon and were shot down by Japanese aircraft. (One of them has not been confirmed). On the 9th, four enemy fighters attacked Mangshi and were shot down by Japanese ground forces. On the morning of October 10, two enemy aircraft attacked the suburbs of Rangoon and were shot down.

On the 14th, eleven enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Rangoon again and were shot down (Northern Australia, Banto Island): On the morning of the 9th, six enemy aircraft attacked the Dili Barda Island. Japanese aircraft immediately took off to intercept them, shooting down two of them. The Japanese also had two self-detonated. (Solomon Islands) Land warfare: After enemy troops landed in strength on Rendova Island and other locations on June 30, the Japanese army in that area fought the enemy repeatedly for three days, inflicting heavy damage on them. Enemy casualties are estimated to be over 13,000 on New Georgia Island and over 1,000 on Arundel Island, totaling over 15,000. When the Japanese army retreated to its rear bases on Kolombangara Island and Vella Lavella Island in early October, it was not hindered by the enemy in any way. Air warfare: In early October, approximately 106 enemy aircraft attacked the Solomon Islands area, and the Japanese army shot down 37 of them (including eight shot down by Japanese ground artillery). One Japanese aircraft did not return. (New Guinea) Land warfare: The Japanese army is currently working closely with air units at Finschhafen to continue fierce battles with the enemy. Air warfare: The Japanese air force attacked near Finschhafen on the evening of the 10th, sinking three enemy large motorboats in the Cape Cretin area. Two others were hit and caught fire. They also bombed enemy supply depots near Finschhafen, causing a major fire. When the Japanese aircraft attacked the east coast of Cape Gerte, one bomb landed near an enemy ship.

<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Advances in Several Routes, British Concentrate Forces on Indian Border</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Japanese headquarters announced at 3:00 pm on the 16th that the Chongqing army is attempting to retake Burma and is currently concentrating its forces in southwestern China. The Imperial Army in Burma is preventing it from launching an offensive, and began attacking from Tengyue and Myitkyina in the early part of last month, and is still breaking through the Chongqing army everywhere and pushing forward.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) The enemy army, in order to launch a general offensive to retake Burma during the rainy season, has been actively strengthening its war preparations and strengthening its blind bombing of Burma since the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, arrived in New Delhi. It has also concentrated approximately ten divisions of troops on the front line of the Burma-India border in an attempt to invade. On the 8th of this month, 200 enemy soldiers attempted to invade Maungdaw with 16 boats to scout the strength of the Japanese army, but they were annihilated. At the same time, the Burma Expeditionary Force under Chen Cheng of the Chongqing army, based in Kunming, also responded to this, and drew more than ten divisions from the Fifth Group Army led by Du Yuming, the Ninth Group Army of Guan Linzheng, and the Eleventh Group Army of Song Xilian, attempting to advance from Yunnan to northern Burma. The Japanese army in that area, in order to give the Chongqing army a fatal blow this month, launched an attack from Tengyue and Myitkyina on the Yunnan border in several routes, breaking through the dangerous Gaoligon Mountains and Great Snow Mountains, and is still advancing fiercely with the force of anger. The collapsing army in that area, in order to urgently solve the shortage of domestic supplies, wants to open a new highway from Baoshan in Yunnan, through Tengyue and Myitkyina, to Assam in northern India. Currently, the Chongqing army gathered in that area no longer uses Soviet-made weapons, but is fully equipped with American-made equipment, and is preparing to start moving under the command of smiling army generals. However, they were suddenly attacked by the Japanese army, and their dream finally turned into a bubble. Because there are dangerous roads in the Gaoligon Mountains and Great Snow Mountains and the torrents of the Nu River in this area, the construction of a new road must cross the humid area before reaching Assam in India. Even without the Japanese army's attack, the project is extremely difficult. Today, the inside story of the Chongqing side is really unspeakable.</p>

<p>The Japanese Government Strengthens Military Strength, Decides to Establish Munitions Company, Provides Guidance and Supervision to Achieve Increased Production</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - In order to thoroughly strengthen the wartime system, the Japanese government, which had announced before the convocation of the 83rd Extraordinary Session of the Diet its active preparation of proposals for establishing ministries such as the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to reform the central administrative structure, as well as concrete measures to thoroughly strengthen national mobilization and domestic defense posture, has decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 15th to submit to the Diet 34 draft laws and the three-body system of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. The important items in this strengthening plan have been completely concretized. The contents were announced by the Information Bureau on the afternoon of the 15th. Among the 14 draft laws, the most noteworthy is the draft law on munitions companies, which was decided upon along with the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. This bill can be described as a measure adopted by the Japanese government to increase its war power. The main points are as follows: To clearly indicate that the production of munitions companies is to meet the requirements of the country and to bear an important mission to the country, while actively promoting the production and cultivation of workers. To lift various legal restrictions and prohibitions, so as to eliminate the cumbersome written supervision and allow them to concentrate on production. To set up production responsible persons and production undertakers, so as to achieve increased production through their creativity and efforts. In addition to making production responsible persons and production undertakers responsible to the country for production, the government is also clarifying their merits and demerits through rewards and punishments. In order to accurately grasp the actual situation of munitions companies and ensure smooth production, the government will implement effective supervision.</p>

<h3>Subtle Soviet-Turkish Relations After Changes in European War Situation, Turkish Ambassador to Soviet Union Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - Moscow dispatch: The newly appointed Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Batour, arrived in Moscow on Friday. Those who welcomed him at the station included members of the Turkish Embassy and representatives of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the changes in the European war situation, Soviet-Turkish relations have become more subtle. Turkish political figures are extremely concerned about the movements of the Soviet Union due to the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the upcoming Mediterranean Commission. It is rumored that there have been clashes between Soviet and Turkish troops on the border, but after investigation, it has been proven that this statement is completely false. It is believed that Soviet-Turkish relations will become more tense in the future. There are three reasons: First, the Soviet army is fighting better in the East, and has landed on the Crimean Peninsula. It is expected that the Soviet army's activities in the Black Sea will become more active. Second, taking advantage of its favorable military situation, the Soviet Union is trying to interfere with the Dardanelles Strait and Turkish rights. Recently, some Soviet newspapers have publicly attacked Turkey's neutral policy. The Turkish government has also used various newspaper editorials to clarify Turkey's unchanged willingness to maintain its neutral policy. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union will increase its pressure on Turkey in the future. Third, Britain seems to be ignoring the tension in Soviet-Turkish relations, so British-Turkish relations have also gradually become colder recently. Turkey believes that the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are incompatible and it is extremely difficult to achieve full reconciliation. In addition, the recent establishment of the Mediterranean Commission by the anti-Axis countries, its mission is unclear. Therefore, the Turkish political circles are extremely worried that the Soviet Union has sent Foreign Vice Minister Vyshinsky and other representatives to attend the committee, which has actually demonstrated the Soviet Union's intentions towards the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>Fierce Counterattacks by German Troops on Both Sides of Kiev, Fighting in the Nevel Area Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German army launched a counterattack on the 15th, fiercely repelling enemy troops advancing southeast and north of Kiev, destroying 59 enemy tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters military reporter Setorius said: At present, the two major centers of the Soviet offensive are between the Dnieper River near Kiev and the Sea of Azov. The Soviet army is increasing its attacking force in both places, making slight progress at the cost of heavy sacrifices, but still failing to complete its large-scale breakthrough attempt. The German withdrawal from Chaplinka has no decisive impact on the three-week war between the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and Crimea. Chaplinka was originally one of the German bridgeheads east of the Dnieper River, mainly to protect the flanks of the German troops advancing north. It was expected that the Soviet army would launch a fierce attack on it. In fact, Chaplinka is far away from the main defensive line along the river. The German troops stationed there were mainly to meet the vanguard of the Soviet attacking troops. This goal has been achieved in the past three weeks. The German army has now cut off the enemy army on the Volkhov River and has built strong positions on the west bank of the river, and can now head-on attack the attacking enemy army. The Soviet army also failed to achieve its breakthrough wishes in the areas of Helderburg west of the entrance to the Nogaisk steppe south of Chapayevka, and Melitopol, only achieving partial breakthroughs in the German lines. The vanguard of the Soviet army advancing towards the eastern section of Melitopol has now encountered a strong German counterattack, and fierce fighting is still underway there. On the Kiev front, the Soviet army has repeatedly launched offensives with heavy troops from the bridgeheads north and southeast of the city, but they have been repelled by our army's counterattacks and have been contained. The pressure exerted by the enemy in the Kiev area is still heavy, and the fierce fighting in the past two days will continue. In other sections of the Dnieper River, the German army has cleared enemy strongholds on both banks. The German army has also stepped up its pressure on the Soviet Berislav bridgehead. There is no change in the Gomel battle situation. The enemy launched an offensive east of Orsha on the Smolensk-Minsk highway, and was severely damaged and repulsed by our army. The fighting in the Nevel area has now become quiet.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line sources: After a fierce artillery preparation, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack on the Kremenchug area from the Dnieper River bridgehead yesterday with strong infantry and tank troops. Fighting is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Replaces Minister of Agriculture</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Moscow News Agency reported yesterday that the Soviet People's Commissar for Agriculture has been succeeded by Gusenko. The name of the former Commissar, Sharunov, was not mentioned, and when he left office was never formally announced. The region under the jurisdiction of the Commissar is the most important agricultural production area in the Soviet Union. This leadership change may be due to improper harvest preparations.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - When the U.S. Air Force bombed Schweinfurt, 80 kilometers east of Frankfurt, on the afternoon of the 14th, it lost 139 aircraft. According to a London dispatch, U.S. 8th Bomber Command Commander Anderson still used his usual deceptive tactics regarding the damage to U.S. aircraft in this operation, only announcing the loss of 62 aircraft, and even claiming that he had long predicted that there would be damage this year, so the loss of a large number of aircraft this time is not surprising. However, according to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt frankly admitted defeat when receiving reporters on the 15th, saying that if the U.S. Air Force suffered such losses every day, the future would be unimaginable. U.S. pilots who participated in the bombing said that the German ground fire was extremely fierce, and the German Air Force fighter squadrons flew up to intercept the U.S. aircraft one and a half hours before they reached their destination, so the bombing was extremely difficult. German News Agency Air Force reporter Haringsleben's commentary on the air battle stated that the total number of U.S. aircraft participating in the bombing was about 300, and about half of them were shot down by the German army. The U.S. military's claim that heavily armored "Flying Fortresses" continued to be reduced to ashes, estimates that at least 1,200 pilots were killed and more than 1,700 machine guns were lost. One of the reasons why the German army achieved this great victory was the reinforcement of air defense equipment. According to a U.S. airman who landed near Munich, the German army used rocket smoke screens in this air battle. However, the German authorities did not explain what equipment and nature this type of smoke screen had.</p>
<h3>German Planes Attack Britain</h3>

<h3>Bulgaria's Replacement of Foreign Minister Not Valued by Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: The German political circles do not value Bulgaria's replacement of its Foreign Minister. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that this change was a natural result of Kirov's illness. The new Foreign Minister, Hishmanov, has experience in the diplomatic field and is an old friend of Germany.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Appoints Ambassador to Egypt</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency. According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet government has appointed Lapin as its ambassador to Egypt.</p>
<h3>Winant to be Appointed Cabinet Member</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: New York message. The New York Post reported that U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Winant, will be appointed as a Cabinet member to replace Secretary of Labor Perkins. The newspaper did not mention Winant's successor.</p>
<h3>Schweinfurt Air Battle, German Army Uses "Inlay Tactics," U.S. Loses Large Number of Flying Fortresses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters aviation reporter Zipelin, German military sources said that nearly half of the Flying Fortresses that flew over German territory on Thursday were shot down. Of the 300 American bombers attacking Schweinfurt, 139 were destroyed. The success of German air defense is due to two aspects: First, the German army used the latest "inlay tactics." Second, the strengthening of air defense. The so-called "inlay tactics" is to disperse group air combat into individual operations, during which enemy aircraft are attacked one by one. The German army's victory over the Flying Fortresses this time was the enemy's greatest setback in this battle. American bombers fly at extremely high altitudes and have the protection of long-range fighters, but when flying from the coast to the target, they are intercepted by countless Me aircraft. The Me aircraft specifically chose bombers as their targets, and the enemy fighters were unable to do anything about it, so the American bombers became disorganized and suffered heavy losses. Although some enemy aircraft were able to reach their destination in Schweinfurt, they were unable to launch an effective attack due to the lack of organization. The U.S. Air Force lost a large number of aircraft and 1,400 air force personnel and approximately 1,700 machine guns in one day. Therefore, the losses of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Britain since October 1 have been greater than what can be replenished.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Underway North of the Volturno River</h3>
<p>German Troops Withdraw from Campobasso</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: The British and American armies crossed the Volturno River and gained two footholds on the north bank of the river on Tuesday. On Thursday, the German army launched a fierce attack on the enemy bridgehead and entered the enemy lines. In the afternoon of the same day, the British and American armies launched an attack with a large number of infantry and tank teams on the German outposts on both banks of the Volturno River. German military sources said that the British and American offensive was expected, and fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 15th that the German army in southern Italy had destroyed important military facilities in the city of Campobasso (50 miles northeast of Naples) on the night of the 14th and had withdrawn from the city. The attempt by the U.S.-Canadian Allied Forces to wipe out the German army in the city had completely failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters military reporter said that the German command adopted a strategy of prolonging the front line and making the British and American armies attack at the beginning of the war in southern Italy, and the German forces deployed were to inflict possible losses on the enemy. The strategy in the past two days has proven to be successful. As stated in the German war report on the 15th, in the past two days, the enemy has attacked the German outposts with a "superior" force. Only a small number of German troops were stationed there, and the main German force did not engage with them, so Alexander could not find out when and where the main German force would engage them. However, the German troops guarding the outposts were all elite troops, who could both contain the enemy's forces and deplete their strength. Therefore, the enemy's battle to seize the German outposts is still in full swing. Therefore, the left wing of the U.S. Fifth Army advancing from the north bank of the Volturno has slowed down. The troops landed by the British army in the Gulf of Gaeta north of the Volturno River encountered strong German resistance and failed to change the battle situation there. The enemy pressure in the Capua area is very strong. The right wing of the U.S. Fifth Army in the mountainous area north of Capua is now advancing towards Miletto and Venafro, and the attacking force is becoming stronger and stronger. The left wing of the British Eighth Army is seizing the outposts of the German army in front of the ancient town of Isérnia and the German positions northeast of Campobasso. The British army has no major activity between Termoli and Vasto. It is clear that Montgomery has transferred his right-wing troops to the left wing to fight.</p>
<h3>German Commander-in-Chief in Western Europe Inspects Mediterranean Defenses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Commander-in-Chief in Western Europe, Field Marshal von Rundstedt, recently inspected the defense facilities along the Mediterranean coast. It is reported that the Field Marshal is very satisfied with the strong defensive positions built between the Alps and the Pyrenees over the past few months.</p>
<h3>Tiger Plague Epidemic in Bengal Province, India</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Calcutta, Bengal Province, India, which is facing a severe food crisis, is suffering from a tiger plague epidemic. It is reported that in the Bogura area alone, 250 people have died of the tiger plague in just one week. It has now spread to Calcutta, where 82 cases occurred last week and 97 cases have occurred this week.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Philippine Industry Situation</h3>
<p>The Philippines is now undertaking a new mission and hope in the process of carrying out the Greater East Asia War, and is embarking on a path of glorious independence. Geographically, the Philippines is the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In terms of resources, it is the largest producer of national defense resources in the southern regions. The future development of the New Philippines is indeed promising. In addition to mineral resources, it also possesses abundant resources such as copra, hemp, and cotton. With the progress of future development, the Philippines, as a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has taken on an extremely important task.</p>
<p>So, in what direction should the Philippine economy proceed in the future? First, it is to ensure the resources to enhance war power that are directly related to the execution of the war. Second, it is to develop industries that make the Philippine economy the center and become a link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere economy. The former includes mineral resources such as copper, manganese, and ore, and the latter includes copra, hemp, cotton, wood, and oils. On the other hand, the domestic food problem and the security problem have a great impact on industrial development and are required to be resolved as soon as possible. In terms of food countermeasures, the establishment of a self-sufficiency system for rice, which is a staple food for islanders, requires the authorities to thoroughly re-examine all aspects of agriculture. The production target is projected to be 63.85 million cavans (one cavan equals four dou and one sheng). Under the "Five-Year Production Increase Plan," preparations are being actively carried out, and an annual budget of 〇〇 is allocated to improve irrigation and drainage facilities, increase the propagation of excellent varieties, improve cultivation methods, increase the production of self-supplied fertilizers, and utilize idle land. Japanese and Filipino agricultural personnel work together to increase production. The following will examine the progress of individual industries that serve as war materials and become the center of the economy.</p>
<p>Mining</p>
<p>Among the occupied territories in the South, the Philippines is considered to be the first in terms of surveyed mineral resources and has a promising future. In 1940, the total number of mines in the Philippines was 80, with a total mineral production value of 92.62 million pesos (Philippine currency). Among them, the gold mining industry accounted for 85% of the total, amounting to 76.83 million pesos, silver mining 1.98 million pesos, ore mining 4 million pesos, ship mining 118,000 pesos, 2.61 million pesos, iron 560,000 pesos, and manganese 1.42 million pesos. It is no exaggeration to say that the Philippine mining industry is a gold mining industry. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there has inevitably been a change, and its focus has shifted from the gold mining industry to copper, ore, and manganese. Therefore, industries such as gold and silver inlaying, which are directly related to the war, will inevitably be reorganized, and their surplus machinery will be transferred to important mining industries. The total number of mines was originally 80, but after reorganization, only 〇〇 remained, placed under military management and operating smoothly.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>Philippine agriculture has always been relatively well-developed, but most of the major food crops, starting with rice, have relied heavily on overseas imports, which is a fatal flaw. With the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere economic system in the future, further adjustments are needed.</p>
<p>Hemp</p>
<p>The annual production of Manila hemp is approximately 〇〇 tons. Domestic demand is approximately 〇〇 tons, and the remaining 〇〇 tons can be exported to Japan and various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Currently, this material is used as a raw material for shipbuilding, weaving, hat making, papermaking, etc., and its demand is greatly increasing. In the future, the supply of hemp within the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere will be determined to be supplied by the Philippines alone, and therefore Philippine hemp is of great significance. To increase production, the authorities provide various conveniences, engage in purchasing and adjusting prices to maintain market prices, improve cultivation and production methods, and increase the mechanical power of hemp manufacturing. The factories in various places are moved to Taibao, where collection, manufacturing, and transportation are concentrated, and efforts are made to increase production.</p>
<p>Copra</p>
<p>Copra, like Manila hemp, is an important industry in the Philippines and occupies an important position. The Philippines has one of the world's leading copra production volumes, and about 4 million islanders have relied on this industry for their livelihood in the past. The resources are extremely rich, and because small industries in various places are invested and managed by individuals, they have a great impact on the economic life of the islanders, and thus have great significance in grasping the hearts of the people. The planting area is approximately 〇〇 acres, the number of trees is approximately 〇〇 thousand, and the copra production volume is approximately 〇〇 tons. Currently, it is widely transported to various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with Japan as the center. The increase in copra production depends greatly on the smooth operation of collection. To achieve effective unified control and purchasing, the "Philippine Copra Purchasing Association" is established, dividing the production areas into several regions and stipulating the purchasing volume for each region. The purchasing volume projected for this year has exceeded 〇〇 tons. If the Philippines can fully purchase copra, the Co-Prosperity Sphere's copra needs will be sufficiently supplied by the Philippines alone.</p>
<p>The development of the oil industry using copra as raw material is also an urgent task at present. Before the war, with small-scale mechanical power, the annual production of coconut oil was 300,000 tons, and the annual production of heavy oil substitute fuel was 180,000 tons, making it the only coconut oil production area in the South. It is not only manufacturing coconut oil, but also starting to manufacture high-grade oils such as hardened oil and lubricating oil. The various oil extraction factories in the suburbs of Manila are moved to the rural areas of the production areas to enhance the oil industry.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>In Philippine agriculture, the most important issue and the one that has a great impact on future industrial development is the sugar industry. It accounted for 40% of the Philippines' total exports in the past, with an annual production of 〇〇 tons and an annual revenue of more than 100 million pesos for the national treasury. Of the approximately 〇〇 tons of sugar produced, approximately 〇〇 tons are consumed domestically, and the remaining 〇〇 tons of export markets have been blocked due to the war. The future is bound to change. A part of the sugar industry has been converted into cotton production under the Greater East Asia economic plan.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The transition from sugar to cotton production has been quite successful during the trial period last year, overcoming all unfavorable conditions. Although there is no room for discussion on land conditions, considerable effort is still needed in technical guidance to complete the five-year plan of 〇〇 piculs. However, in the first year, experience has been gained and improvements have been made in various aspects such as land improvement, cultivation technology guidance, cultivation of excellent varieties, and pest control. With the preparation of various necessary conditions, cotton cultivation has already been implemented this year, and it is planned to ensure a harvest of 〇〇 piculs of cotton. The number of Japanese technicians has also greatly increased this year, already exceeding one hundred. They are studying cultivation countermeasures that match the land conditions, pre-calculating the timing of droughts and rainy seasons, and preventing them to ensure perfection.</p>
<p>The development of the spinning industry is also in the plan. The spinning industry that has been reorganized in Japan is being actively moved to the Philippines. 〇〇 spindles have already been moved, and combined with local machinery and equipment, a powerful factory has been completed. In terms of the need for cotton cloth, Philippine cotton cultivation will make a great contribution. In addition, the promising industries in the Philippines are timber and fisheries. Timber is centered on Mindanao Island, with thousands of acres of forest land. After the outbreak of the war, it was often transported to Japan as an exchange item.

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Adulteration in the Sale of Grains, Oils, and Sugar</h3>
<p>The authorities are in charge of the planned export of grains, oils, and sugar to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, the sales firms also conducted secret inspections in advance. Recently, a small number of firms have been illegally adulterating and selling goods, hoping to obtain extra profits. It is now learned that the authorities have decided to strictly prohibit such incidents. If it is found to be true, in addition to being punished according to the law, the sales qualification will also be revoked.</p>
<h3>Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association Decides on Organizational Regulations, Grain Control Council Passes Measures for Procurement Certificates</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Rice Grain Control Committee is actively preparing to urge merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special city areas of Nanjing and Shanghai to organize a Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association to meet the needs of the people's food. Branch offices will be set up to engage in rice grain procurement. The association also continued to hold plenary committee meetings the day before yesterday and yesterday, resulting in the amendment and passage of: Interim Organizational and Operating Rules for the Preparatory Committee of the Local Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association, Interim Operating Regulations for the Local Offices of the Rice Grain Control Committee, Operating Rules for the Rice Grain Control Committee, and Measures for Applying for the Issuance of Rice Grain Procurement Certificates and Rice Grain Transportation Passports.

It is learned that the various district offices of the association and the local rice grain procurement trade associations will be established around the 20th of this month. The preparatory committees of the local procurement trade associations will be designated by the registered and surety-paid procurement merchants in each region to take charge of the organization. The local offices of the association will be divided into twelve districts: Shanghai District, Nanjing District, Yangzhou District, Suzhou District, Su-Song-Chang-Jia District, Taizhou District, Huzhou District, Wuhu District, Luhe District, Suzhou First, Second, and Third Period Districts, Zhenjiang District, Taihu Southeast First Period District, and Taihu Southeast Second Period District. Each branch office will have one chief director and one or two deputy directors. The internal organization includes: General Affairs, Finance, and Business departments. It is heard that the association will soon convene a meeting of the preparatory committees of the local procurement trade associations to discuss the main points of the association's organization and to be responsible for the procurement of rice grains. As for the surety deposits to be paid by the procurement merchants in each region, the original deadline was the 15th of this month, but since some are unable to rush to complete the procedures due to the long distance, it will be extended to noon on the 19th of this month.</p>

<h3>Private School Teachers' Subsidies to be Issued on the 20th, Approved List Sent Out</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai News reporters inquiring from the Education Authorities, the issuance of subsidies for private schools is largely prepared. The lists of teachers applying for subsidies from various schools have been sent in, and after review and completion by the authorities, the approved receipts will be sent to the schools separately, and the persons in charge of the schools will go to collect them on the 20th. The authorities have initiated a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan to teachers in private schools, entirely out of concern for the difficult treatment of teachers under the current situation, and have tried to add a little support so that teachers can stabilize their work in their positions. Therefore, it is hoped that colleagues in the education field will appreciate the authorities' hard work.</p>

Future meetings will be held on the Thursday of the third week of each month.</p>
<h3>Movement of Leather Within the City Not Restricted, Rawhide Purchase Plan Under Study</h3>
<p>Leather is a major commodity and also a military raw material. Since the establishment of the Leather Federation, it has first urged the reorganization of trade associations in various places and the investigation of the production and sales volume of rawhide. On the friendly side, the Sino-Japanese Leather Federation has also been established. The Federation, in view of the need for business liaison, intends to request the establishment of a leather professional department under the National Commercial Control Council to facilitate consultation and implementation. Furthermore, in order to properly supply both military and civilian use of rawhide, which is the raw material for all leather, it is planned to unify the purchase and centralized allocation, with the Sino-Japanese Rawhide Trade Association jointly establishing a joint procurement and sales agency. The detailed plan is currently under consultation and study. As for finished leather, there is currently no talk of purchase. Yesterday's report that the movement of all leather in this city is not allowed, pending registration within a limited time, has been learned from knowledgeable sources that it is not true. The movement of leather within the city is still not subject to any restrictions.</p>
<h3>Murderer Tang Rongchang Executed by Hanging Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gao Qinong, who lived at No. 32, Yanjiazhai, Fanhuan Road (Old Jessfield Road), and was engaged in the pig intestine business, was constantly lowering the selling price when buying and selling pig intestines, which violated the rules of the union and affected the business of other intestine businesses, causing resentment. On the morning of July 21, 1941, a group of thugs suddenly broke into Gao's house and opened fire, killing Gao and his wife. It was not until 1942 that Tang Rongchang (34 years old), a Wuxi native, was captured by the former Public Concession Police, and was interrogated and sentenced to death by the former First Special Court. The sentence has been finalized and awaiting execution. The Shanghai Local Procuratorate has received instructions from the Ministry of Justice to execute the criminal on a scheduled basis. Yesterday morning, the Local Procuratorate took Tang from the Shanghai Prison and escorted him to the execution ground outside the Second Branch Prison of Shanghai. After the prosecutor questioned his year and place of birth, he verified his identity and executed him by hanging according to law.</p>
<h3>Coal Balls in Short Supply, Difficult to Purchase, Fuel Panic Needs Adjustment</h3>
<p>Coal balls, an indispensable fuel for residents every day, have become increasingly scarce in the past week. Residents are finding it difficult to purchase them, and there is a risk of being forced to stop cooking. Therefore, the authorities should be consistent and immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth and adjust the supply situation. It is generally believed that although it is difficult to purchase scattered coal balls recently, the various manufacturers still deliver them to direct users as usual. At the same time, residents, eager to alleviate the fuel panic, are purchasing from the black market, where the price is said to be more than double the standard price limit. According to those familiar with the coal ball market, the true raw material (white coal powder) for manufacturing coal balls is only 50%, with 30% being coal slag and 20% being yellow mud. Therefore, the burning power has obviously decreased. The reserve of white coal powder used to manufacture coal balls is still quite abundant, and the source continues to arrive. It is allocated by the relevant authorities on a regular basis, but the current situation of no goods available on the market is unexpected.</p>
<h3>City Propaganda Department Holds First Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Various Municipal Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: To improve the knowledge of municipal facilities among reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in the city, and to ensure the accuracy of news reporting, the City Propaganda Department held its first regular press conference yesterday at 10 a.m. in the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall. Attendees from the press included: Matsudaira Kyushu (Domei News Agency), Cheng Yiping (Central News Agency), Jiang (China Daily), Liu Han (Shen Bao), Li Zhi ( ), Saki Kunio (Mainland News), Tang Xiongfeng (Ping Bao), and Yu Zhi (News ). Representatives from various government agencies included: Huanxiang (Third Police Bureau, Baojia Office), Xu Ming (Public Works Bureau), Shen Hua (Huxi Police Bureau), Zhou Xihuang (Food Bureau), Chen Jiufeng (First District Baojia Committee), Cu Tiehan (Public Utilities Bureau), Jin Pingshan (City Baojia Committee), Xu Rong (Second Police Bureau), Wei Zhonggong (Finance Bureau), as well as Director Liang Xiuyu and Secretary Jiang Qiqi of the department, totaling more than twenty people. Director Liang presided over the meeting, beginning with introductory remarks, stating that today's regular press conference was decided upon based on the previous Municipal News Reporting Liaison Meeting. Since the establishment of the Propaganda Department, it has strived to establish close contact with various newspaper offices. At the same time, in order to ensure the accuracy and speed of news sources for municipal news reporting, the newspapers also hoped that the Propaganda Department would hold regular press conferences. The newspapers would submit municipal issues in advance, and the Propaganda Department would contact various agencies to send representatives to answer questions, so as to ensure that the people understand the direction of municipal facilities, and so on. Then, representatives from various agencies answered the following questions in turn:</p>
<p>Current Baojia System Issues</p>
<p>(Shen Bao asked: What are the current Baojia regional divisions? What is the organizational structure of the Baojia offices in the first and eighth districts? Is the Baojia a subordinate agency of the police bureau, or a parallel agency? What is the scope of authority of the Jia Committee organized by citizens? There are differences in the selection of self-defense corps in the first district and civilian police on duty in the eighth district. What is the reason for this?) (The First and Eighth District Baojia Committees replied:) Regarding the boundaries of the Baojia districts and the status relationship with the police bureau, the following answers can be given: In the past, there were seven districts within the Shanghai International Settlement, and another naval Baojia district in Hongkou. The municipal districts were the municipal western district, which belonged to the Municipal Baojia Committee. After the recovery of the concessions, the Baojia office in the first district was directly under the Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau. In the eighth district, a Baojia branch office was established separately. Regarding the issue of the authority of the Baojia Committee organized by citizens, the name of the Baojia Committee organized by citizens is the Baojia Guidance Committee, which is not an executive agency, but a consulting agency for the Baojia. Regarding the difference in service between the self-defense corps and civilian police corps in the first and eighth districts, the regulations in the first district are stricter. All those aged between twenty and forty-five without disabilities are required to be on duty, while the eighth district stipulates that they must be between twenty-five and thirty-five years old. Moreover, because those on rotation are selected through a draw, they do not all take turns. This situation naturally involves degrees of importance. Since the Baojia in the eighth district has been managed by the Baojia office and branch office, there has been a gradual trend of rectification. If there are unscrupulous elements who use the name of the Baojia to exploit the people, it is hoped that they will be reported at any time, so as to ensure the soundness of the Baojia organization and achieve the goal of maintaining local security.</p>
<p>Rice Rationing Issues</p>
<p>(Ping Bao asked:) Since the city implemented per capita rice rationing, prices have increased, while the amount has decreased. Moreover, the announcement often includes unclear and indefinite wording such as "either white rice, brown rice, or broken rice," which provides opportunities for rice shops to engage in malpractice. The above are important issues concerning the people's food supply. Are there any methods to improve this in the shortest period of time? (Food Bureau replied:) The reduction in rice allocation is due to the inability to transport smoothly, and the increase in transportation costs is also a reason for the increase in rice prices. The rice quality and quantity allocation issues are under the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee, and because there is no annotation on the warehouse receipt, the distribution can only be done according to the rice after it is released from the warehouse. The urban area has always required each rice shop to sell white rice, brown rice, and broken rice clearly in accordance with the announcement. As for the above situation, it is probably a phenomenon of the first and eighth districts, and the right to allocate rice in the first and eighth districts does not belong to the Food Bureau. Regarding prices and quantities, we are actively working to improve.</p>
<p>Iron Gate Removal Issue</p>
<p>(Ping Bao asked:) The iron gates at the junction of the city and the former concessions were initially said to be completely removed, then completely opened, and then increased in number, but none of this has been implemented so far. These iron gates should be completely removed as soon as possible to give a new impression and facilitate transportation. What measures will the municipal authorities take in this regard? (Public Works Bureau replied:) Regarding the issue of removing the iron gates at the border between the former city and the concession, the Public Works Bureau planned to prepare for the removal at the end of July when the concessions were recovered. Later, the police department believed that it was better not to remove them for the sake of current police and security relations.</p>
<p>Tram Through-Service Issues</p>
<p>(Ping Bao asked:) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, public transportation in Shanghai has been greatly reduced, and the problem of citizens traveling is very serious. This can be seen from the congestion of trams on various routes. In the future, are there any preparations for improving this? The trams in the first and eighth districts used to be able to run through all routes, but now almost all stop at the border. The through-service of trams in the two districts would greatly facilitate citizens. Can the method of restoring full through-service be studied now? The population of Nanshi has recently increased, but public transportation is still lacking. The restoration of trams may not be possible for a while due to a lack of materials, but there is not much difficulty in operating public charcoal-powered vehicles. Is there any possibility of restoring public transportation in Nanshi in the future! (Public Utilities Bureau replied:) Regarding the issue of tram through-service in the first and eighth districts, the Public Utilities Bureau consulted with the tram company as soon as the concessions were recovered and has already restored part of it. Routes 18 and 24 have now been connected through the two districts. Routes 17, 6, 5, and 12 cannot be restored to their original state for the time being. Regarding the issue of operating public buses in Nanshi, there is a shortage of materials and various difficulties. It may be difficult to implement public buses in Nanshi for the time being.</p>
<h3>Paper Transportation to Three Provinces and Two Cities No Longer Requires Permit, Transportation to South and North China Requires Approval</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the Commerce and Trade Control Commission yesterday that the transportation of various types of paper from Shanghai to three provinces and two cities no longer requires a permit from the Commerce and Trade Control Commission. However, if transporting to South China, North China, etc., one must first obtain a permit for import from the local government, and then apply to the Materials Transfer Permit Office of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission for a permit to move out. Otherwise, private transportation is absolutely prohibited.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of the Passing of Master Hongyi</h3>
<p>The venerable Master Hongyi passed away in Quanzhou a year ago. The Shanghai Master Hongyi Memorial Association has scheduled a vegetarian offering and Buddhist chanting at the Jade Buddha Temple on Pinlang Road today to dedicate merit. They have also collected posthumous works and displayed them in a room for public viewing. It is also reported that the association will establish a library to commemorate the master, named the Hongyi Library, and preparations are already underway.</p>

<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Improving Transportation</h3>
<p>At yesterday's general meeting of the Citizens' Welfare Association, there was a proposed resolution requesting the improvement of transportation. Transportation is supposed to primarily serve the convenience of travelers. If travelers feel inconvenienced, the quality of transportation can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>Just considering the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, before the July 7th Incident in 1937, the two railways were well-managed and convenient for travelers, as anyone who traveled those routes could attest. However, the current state of transportation on those two railways is so painful that one doesn't need to travel to experience it. Even a visit to the North Station reveals chaotic scenes of queuing, pushing, and quarreling, resembling a picture of chaos. Under such circumstances, there are those who pay for assistance and are forced to squeeze through, and there are those whose luggage disappears in an instant.</p>
<p>This spring, we appealed on behalf of travelers, requesting the transportation authorities to improve the situation. The authorities gradually rectified the situation, and public opinion was favorable. However, it soon reverted to its old state. Our suggestions to the transportation authorities have been detailed and thorough, and the initial willingness of the authorities to listen to our concerns was commendable. Unfortunately, they lacked the perseverance to maintain the improvements, resulting in the current situation deteriorating.</p>
<p>We solemnly reiterate: "The primary purpose of transportation is to facilitate travel." We urge the transportation authorities to pay close attention to and pursue methods to achieve this goal at all times and in all places. If the Huazhong Railway Company's resources are limited and it cannot rectify the entire situation, then the municipal authorities, relevant parties, and social organizations should assist in solving the problem. They must not turn a blind eye and allow travelers to suffer. We believe that it is a disgrace to a modern country if transportation cannot serve the convenience of travelers.</p>

<h3>Promoting the Chemical Industry</h3>
<p>The Third East Asia Economic Beijing Conference was held at Huairentang, Zhongnanhai, Beijing, from September 27th. The specific issue that was particularly discussed was how to overcome obstacles to increased production, and the chemical industry in North China deserves special attention from people in Central China. Speaking of the chemical industry, with the soda and acid industries using salt as raw materials as the center, industries such as glass, oil, pharmaceuticals, papermaking can be developed. However, the development of these industries in North China is slower than other industries, due to the lack of electricity, materials, and funds. Therefore, at the conference, some people strongly advocated the establishment of a chemical industry review agency, "which attracted considerable attention."</p>
<p>Why does the chemical industry particularly deserve attention from people in Central China? First, the chemical industry in Central China already has a considerable foundation, and it is relatively easy to develop and expand. Second, the three basic conditions required by the chemical industry—electricity, materials, and funds—are not a problem in Central China. It only depends on how we develop these conditions to meet the needs of the chemical industry. Taking electricity as an example, "the total power generation of various power plants in Shanghai is about 200,000 KVA or more, but industrial electricity is still felt to be insufficient, and the chemical industry is no exception. Adjustments should be made frequently to supplement the lack of power for the chemical industry. As for materials, that is, raw materials, the primary raw material for the chemical industry is salt, and salt is the richest natural product in the Central China area. The only issue is how to solve the supply problem, otherwise even table salt will have problems, let alone the raw materials for the chemical industry? As for funds, Central China, especially Shanghai, has plenty of funds. It only depends on how to enhance the public's understanding of the chemical industry and encourage them to invest more in the chemical industry, thereby benefiting the public. Judging from the interest that investors have shown in stocks of new drugs and papermaking industries, this understanding seems to have improved significantly!</p>
<h3>Cotton Production on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Is Not Abundant, Prices Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>This year's new cotton has already entered the market. New cotton has been listed in cotton-producing areas along the Beijing-Shanghai line, such as Taicang and Jiangyin. When cotton yarn and cloth were not yet purchased by the government, cotton prices soared. Later, due to the fall in yarn and cloth prices, cotton prices also fell. Two months ago, the price per dan fell by half. Recently, the Cotton Department of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission implemented centralized purchase of cotton. In order to protect the interests of farmers, the authorities of the commission were unwilling to suppress cotton prices excessively. Therefore, cotton prices, which were unable to rise, gradually showed signs of recovery. As of today, in various cotton-producing areas such as Taicang and Jiangyin, the selling price of new ginned cotton at the beginning of the season has risen, and has subsequently increased gradually. According to cotton industry insiders, during the peak cotton blooming season this year, the harvest was not very good due to the damage caused by the hurricane. Therefore, the selling price of new cotton is expected to continue to rise in the future.</p>

<h3>Invigorating Wartime Sentiment</h3>
<p>Banning Decadent Songs</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Chang Bureau issued an order to ban songs that violate national policy in order to purify the people's political thought. However, this is really not enough. It is also necessary to ban the decadent songs of "      sounds" in order to invigorate the national spirit.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, due to the hoarding and manipulation by merchants, a distortedly prosperous situation has been created in Shanghai. All entertainment has trended towards the enjoyment of low-level material desires. Dance halls, cafes, and large hotels have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. As a result, a large number of songs about "flowers" and "moons" have emerged. Furthermore, through the broadcasting of radio and the circulation of song selections, they have penetrated into all levels of society. On the streets and in the alleys, one can hear a coolie or even an eight- or nine-year-old child humming lyrics such as "Brother, oh brother" and "Sister, oh sister." This not only dampens the ambition of the general public but also affects the education of young people. If these songs are allowed to continue to exist and continue to develop their influence, the future of the nation is truly unimaginable. I wonder if the authorities have paid attention to this? (A Certain Person)</p>
<p>Promoting Popular Music</p>
<p>Music and the people are extremely closely related. The Book of Music says: "The people have blood and qi, and knowledge, and they have the constancy of sadness and joy. They respond to external things and are moved, and then their minds take shape. Therefore, when the sound of urgent slaughter arises, the people think of sorrow; when the sound of harmonious, slow, easy, complex, concise, and restrained music arises, the people are peaceful and happy; when the sound of coarse, sharp, fierce, rising, spirited, and broad music arises, the people are resolute; when the sound of upright, straight, strong, correct, solemn, and respectful music arises, the people are solemn and respectful; when the sound of generous, affluent, inwardly pleasing, harmonious, and moving music arises, the people are ____ ; when the sound of flowing, heretical, evil, respectful, Di, fulfilling, and cleansing music arises, the people are lewd and disorderly...."</p>
<p>However, the music in Shanghai today, whether it is movie theme songs or popular songs in various cabarets, all tend towards hedonism and are mainly about private affairs between men and women. As a result, what is heard on the streets, whether it is pedestrians humming casually or music played on gramophones in shops, is all music for the moment, and soft, saccharine songs about brothers and sisters. Habit becomes nature, and so the general public all take hedonism as a prerequisite, content with ease and accustomed to following the old ways, so that the rich are extravagant and superficial, and the poor deceive each other. Young people fall into debauchery and are infatuated with singing stages and dancing halls, indulging in sensual pleasures. Thus, scholars do not pursue practical learning. Once they get their diplomas, they rejoice that they have a tool to knock on doors with. Merchants only seek profit, hoarding and speculating, ____ their waists growing ever fatter. They spend a thousand gold pieces in a single throw and buy smiles with ten thousand strings of cash. Those who run cabarets also constantly seek novelty and innovation, vying to use sensual pleasures as bait. ____ the one who wears the headscarf, beauty steals his gaze, ____ melodies fill his ears, and he hears and asks about nothing else. As for the government's earnest appeals and the admonitions and criticisms of ____ theories, how can they enter his ears and eyes? How can they cleanse his mind and body? The Marseillaise, a song of revolution, enabled the French Revolution to succeed. The Song of the Rainbow Skirt and Feather Dress almost led to the demise of the Tang Dynasty imperial family. Those in power must not ignore this. Moreover, in these extraordinary times, the survival of a country depends on the strength or weakness of its people's spirit, so wartime music should not be ignored by the wise authorities.</p>
<p>"A wartime nation without wartime sentiment is a shame that the government and the people should share. To speak grandly of participating in the war without any wartime sentiment is a self-deception and even more shameful." (See the April 7th editorial of the Shen Bao).</p>
<p>The spirit of the people is decadent, and all evils are rampant. Under these circumstances, to talk loftily about enriching the country and strengthening the people and seeking to put politics and economics on the right track is truly "to have eyes that can see a thousand miles but forget one's own eyebrows and eyelashes." How can shouting slogans and plastering posters achieve any results? To love ease and hate work is human nature. "Lead the people by example." It is hoped that the government authorities will thoroughly reform all the boring, soft songs and reward and promote wartime popular music in order to correct the people's hearts and inspire their spirit. Other entertainment venues and movie scripts and play plots, etc., must also be ____ and rectified, so that there are normal entertainment venues but no extravagant and wasteful dens of ruin. What should be promoted should be promoted, and what ____ should be eliminated, not neglecting the overall situation because of small evils, and not allowing Shanghai to become a bad place where oranges from the south turn into trifoliate oranges from the north when planted in the north. In this way, the New Movement can ____ advance, the people's hearts can be invigorated, and there will be hope for the revival of the nation. (Liu Hanmin)</p>
<p>Mahjong and Women's Entertainment</p>
<p>Some people think that mahjong is a pastime, but the fundamental purpose of a pastime is how to pass idle time. Now, day and night, even the time for sleeping and resting is spent on this pastime. Whether this is reasonable is self-evident. Others say it is entertainment, but very ____ often, both sides turn red in the face and part on bad terms in order to fight for a single tile. To what extent can this be called entertainment and joy? Therefore, whether viewed from the perspective of pastime or entertainment, it cannot be said that there are sufficient reasons. What is even more heartbreaking is that the average housewife entrusts her children to a nanny and does not care about them at all, only caring about the eight ____ five ____ ; older children ____ on the corner of the mahjong table, pointing and gesturing, actually acting as a dog-headed advisor. Where exactly is the family ____ education? Not ____ losing money, then only the sound of women's stools clattering is heard, only ____ bowls ____ flying about, venting a bellyful of resentment to the fullest extent. As for not recognizing one's relatives and causing domestic unrest, where is family harmony and love? All kinds of bad attitudes ____ can be picked up everywhere. If this goes on for a long time, how will mahjong differ from opium in terms of plunging the people into ruin? If the family is not sound, the foundation for national revival will not be established, and national prosperity and strength will forever be a distant dream!</p>
<p>Although mahjong has been able to penetrate deep into the people today and gain widespread influence, it has its reasons. Taking social interaction as an example, it is indeed ____ simple and convenient. There is a sense that it is indispensable. Therefore, the problem is not mahjong itself but how to eliminate the evils caused by ____ mahjong and how to put mahjong back on the right track. Our research targets are limited to the upper and middle classes, especially the women of the upper and middle classes, because most of them are just lazybones who have nothing to do and use ____ mahjong as their so-called pastime and entertainment. As long as there is a solution for them, the elimination of the evils of mahjong can be easily solved. As for wanting to use the power of the government to achieve the goal of eliminating the evils of mahjong, it is impossible. The government is really powerless to help in this regard. Therefore, the only solution is to seek spontaneous restraint—____ not caring about one's own health and staying up day and night? ____ ____ children's education and lingering in the gaming square? Is it worth sacrificing the harmonious atmosphere of the family, one's own future, and useful time in ____ battle? All kinds of questions should be deeply reflected upon when a person sits down ____ to play mahjong ____ . (The Mahjong Two-Hour League should be given deep sympathy). However, the women of the upper and middle classes, even the young ladies who have received advanced education, have never considered this for a moment, which is truly worthy of tears and weeping. If such women cannot control themselves from mahjong for a day, the evils of mahjong cannot be eliminated for a day!</p>
<p>To fundamentally solve the problem, we must reform women's thinking and promote women's skills, such as needlework, ____ , ____ knots ____ threads, etc. Guide them to have accurate thoughts and understanding, and to have useful work at hand at all times, so that they will not and ____ not waste a lot of time on ____ mahjong. To achieve this goal, the system of women's education really needs to be fundamentally reviewed. It is an undeniable fact that women's education has become a mere decoration for women today. Improper mahjong ____ is a dark side of women's education. The few women who have gained a position in society today are by no means the success of today's women's education but rather the result of their own struggle. Our demand is to reform the system of women's education and make it suitable for the needs of modern countries and societies and the needs of families. Church-style women's education and aristocratic women's education are all to be discarded! Only then will there be hope for family happiness and national revival. (Da Quan)</p>

<h3>The Fact That Impurities in Household Rice Hinder Health</h3>
<p>— Chen Shousheng</p>
<p>I have heard that the adulteration of household rice is harmful to the health of citizens, ____ but I have never seen a victim discover it. Unexpectedly, this disaster happened to my family. My little daughter, fifteen years old, had severe abdominal pain on the eleventh of this month. At that time, I suspected it was "sha" and immediately sent her to the hospital for emergency treatment. Unexpectedly, after the doctor's diagnosis, it was acute appendicitis, and surgery was necessary, otherwise her life would be in danger. At that time, I followed the doctor's advice and had the appendix removed. It is said that the appendix was full of fine sand and stones. I traced the source of this thing and could not help but attribute it to the household rice from the past few periods. The quality is poor, and I hope that the general public will pay more attention to it. I also hope that the food authorities will take into account the health of the citizens. It is okay to allocate brown rice, white rice, or broken rice, as long as the quality of the rice is pure and does not contain fine sand and stones.</p>
<h3>Difficulty for Students Going to Other Cities to Obtain Residence Permits</h3>
<p>A student's family wrote to explain the difficulty for students going to other cities to obtain residence permits: A young man living in the eighth district went to a certain middle school in Nanjing to study, and his Shanghai household registration was naturally reported. However, the baojia system in Nanjing is different from that in Shanghai. Whether commuting or boarding, as long as there is a student card, it is possible to pass freely everywhere. However, the validity period of the student card ends at the end of the semester. When he returns to Shanghai, he hurriedly takes photos and goes through the procedures for applying for a residence permit. After several weeks, he is afraid of being checked for a residence permit on the road. He does not dare to go out the door. Finally, he gets the residence permit, but then he has to go to Nanjing for the start of school. According to the baojia regulations, it is necessary to cancel the residence permit and report it after leaving Shanghai for more than three months. Thinking that the young man will be back on vacation after more than three months, at that time he will not have a Shanghai residence permit and will not dare to go out. If he is unlucky, he will even get slapped. It is a small matter to go to the line and pay a fine, but a misunderstanding is a big deal, so he does not dare to report it; if he does not report it, he is said to be buying household rice (in fact, it is only one he of rice per day). If he reports it now and then reports it again in the future, the application is so troublesome and the residence permit is obtained so slowly, and the photo and other expenses are so expensive. The baojia office staff do not think it is troublesome, but the baojia chief thinks it is annoying. I wonder if the baojia staff also think that there must be many such facts in Shanghai. Is there a remedy?</p>
<h3>An Appeal from a Shantytown Dweller</h3>
<p>I am a shantytown dweller (living in a flat in the Hongkou to Yangshupu area; this house ____ , a house built and managed before the old concession, is not collected ____ donation tickets ____ total ____ shantytown). Recently, I read in your newspaper that soap, matches, and salt have also been rationed, which has greatly reduced the burden on citizens. However, the purchase certificate that is issued is based on the house donation ticket, and it does not mention us shantytown dwellers. Currently, what shantytown dwellers are rationed is only rice flour and oil (the rice flour certificate is issued by the district office, and the oil is bought with the household registration certificate). Sugar has not yet been rationed to this day. If soap, matches, and food ____ are also not rationed, in the future ____ ____ same, then it will be even more unbearable. Therefore, these three necessities are indispensable every day and are more important than sugar. If they are not rationed without a house donation ticket, like in the Zhabei district, there is no house donation ____ are also rationed. The purchase certificate is issued by the baojia office. We shantytown dwellers in the Hongkou district cannot get the same ration, and the jiazhang has no effect. Where should we apply? Please pay attention to this. (Zhou ____ )</p>
<p>Difficult Woman Seeking Employment: I have a daughter ____ who is twenty years old and has a junior high school education. She used to be ____ secretary. Her parents are merchants in the countryside. Because my daughter was betrothed to be married since she was a child, after marrying into the family, she did not know farming skills, which led to her not being liked by her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and disputes often arose. She suffered unlimited mental pain, and life became meaningless. Although her parents allowed her to live at home, it was not a permanent solution. Now, she urgently wants to find a job such as copying or a female assistant or a small teaching assistant or practicing nursing, etc., and strives to be self-reliant and free herself from all kinds of difficulties. ____ ____ Please employ enthusiastic people in society ____ and empathize with her, and send letters to the Dong residence, No. 5, Lane 288, Fuxing Road, Shanghai, for forwarding. (Zhu ____ Xian)</p>
<p>Thanks: Yesterday, I received ten yuan donated by Pu Ji ____ for the teacher Fan Xing, thank you.</p>
