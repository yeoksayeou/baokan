<h3 id="c1">談中小學教育　所望於第三次全國教育會議者（三） <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中小學敎育，是國家敎育的基礎，所以現代强國，未有不悉心殫慮，以確立中小學敎育的基礎的。近十餘年來，我國政府對於中小學敎育，也不能說不加注意；但最大缺點，在於過分重視形式上的標新立異，而漠視國家與社會實際的需要，所以學制的變革不已，而國民敎育的實績難期，全國文盲之充塞如故，中小學畢業者之茫然於時勢大局及其對國家社會之責任者，仍是觸目皆是。我們雖不能說，過去敎育當局及辦理中小學敎育者的慘淡經營，艱苦奮鬥，毫無成就，但其成就之未足以適應國家之需要，則爲不可否認之事實。近年以來，國家多故，人民顚沛，文化敎育，更有衰落之慨。若干大城市之所恢復者，名實之距離尙大，而小城市及鄉鎮間，則更多並國民學校而無之；僅由地方少數有心人士，設立鄉塾蒙館之類，聊讀古人之書，以示弦誦未輟，稍慰父兄之心，至其收效如何，恐多未暇計及。國民基礎敎育的現象，竟至於是，吾人瞻念國家民族之前途，安得不爲之寒心。</p>
<p>目前最大問題，是全國學齡兒童普遍的失學的現象。這個嚴重的現象，如果不首先設法消除，則任何學制之改革，敎育之統制，以及課程之審定等，都不免隔靴搔癢，徒眩紙墨而已。所以當前第一要務，在於普及中小敎；（一）原有中小學校，應自省立縣立者開始，迅速恢復，進而對於原有私立學校，勸導及扶助其恢復。（二）凡治安已恢復之鄉鎮城市，應依居民需要，增設國民學校及初高級中學，由縣市及省當局主持之。（三）鑒於目前一般人民的子弟，求墨所費不勝負担的現實，凡公立學校，應多設免費及半費學額，雖一時不克全部辦到，但小學應佔三分之二，中學亦應超過半數的學額。對於私立學校，一方面應强制减少學費，雜費的徵收額，一面應由政府充分給予補助。（四）在淸鄉工作巳吿結束之地區，應即實行國民敎育强迫入學制度，凡及齡學童，不分性別，皆須入學，其有家境特別淸寒的，應給予補助。</p>
<p>爲了普及中小學敎育，上述各點是必須立即設法求其實現的。當然亦實現中，首先發生的問題是師資的缺乏。這個問題，在事變以前，早巳存在，不過近來特別嚴重者；第一由於物質生活條件，中小學敎師的收入，實際上不僅不足以贍養家庭，而且多不足以維持其本身的生活，於是稍有辦法或能力特別優秀的，就去而之他；學校當局，不得不求其次，濫竽充數。至於學養兼優而尙從事於敎育事業者，只是少數責任心特別强烈，不惜犧牲一己而爲社會國家培養人材，但究屬「鳳毛麟角」，而且決不能期其持久。第二是事變以後師範敎育未能發展，新的敎師未能培養成長。目前一方面固然須立卽擴充各級師範敎育，增設各省市縣的帥範學校，並優定獎勵師範生的辦法，由國家保障師範生畢業　的出路。而另一方面，目前更感迫切的，是由地方各級政府提高中小學敎師的待遇，中小學敎師的薪津，應依各該地物價水準爲標準，而擾予規定。同時，對於敎師的家屬，亦须明定補助辦法。只有敎師最低限度的生活獲得保障，才能使其安心執敎，以增進中小學敎育的效率。</p>
<p>中小學敎育目前的第三個問題是敎材的問題。過去太重視書本，日無暇晷地把敎師和學生束縛在課本和卷子上面，使學生對於國際，國家和現實社會問題，茫無所知；出了學校，便把一切所與的還給先生」。要做人，要在社會活動，便得重新學習起，老實說，這是國民敎育的破產。所以今後的敎材的內容，必須使和國際，國家的現實相街接，必須和時代潮流相銜接，更必須和社會實際問題相街接，而不把學生與敎師束縛在課本上才好。其次，關於課本方面？本報前日社評已經說過。我們希望本屆敎育會議對此也加以愼重的考慮，以滿足中小學敎育的需要。目前上海各大出版公司之停滯狀態，對於國家敎育自然是一種損失，敎育當局應如何協助其恢復，亦是目前迫切的重大工作之一。而且除了敎科書之外，還應該獎勵補充讀物的編輯與出版，敎科書要根據國家的百年大計而編輯，自不能完全以目前參戰，而編一套戰時讀本；可是補充讀物，却可以多採戰時資料，而用以增進戰時敎育的效率了。</p>
<p>最後，為了確保我國民族之生存發展，對於中小學教育，必須注意培養健全的靑少年國民，使其具有獨立自強，克服一切艱難的基本修委。所以必須以軍事化為中心目標，厲行紀律生活，使每個學生的生活謹嚴，容止合度，一切行動，能具備圓滿人格的修養，能負起對於國家民族的責任，務使學生朝夕薰染於有紀律有秩序的風氣，養成整齊。淸潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實的習慣，與負責任守紀律的自覺自發的習性；俾在個人生活上具有獨立自治處理實務的能力，在集體生活上成爲積極努力協同動作的建設國家復興民族的一員。</p>
<p>中小學敎育是決定國家民族未來命運的重要因素，我們熱誠希望本屆敎育會議就上述各點，加以注意與妥擬對策。</p>

<p>汪主席訓詞</p>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　第三次全國敎育行政會議、主席訓詞要點如下、（一）首述時局之開展、本年一月九日、國民政府對英美宣戰、同日友邦日本交還租界撤廢治外法權、接着義大利同樣實行最近法國亦同樣實行、對着就時局的開展、更需要全國上下、在精神上物質上不斷的努力、以求不斷的進歩、今天第三次全國敎育行政會議開會、瞻望大勢、一方面要認識時局之開展、一方面更應感覺責任之重大、不要辜負了時局之開展、再陷前途之困難、全國經濟會犧全國軍事會議、皆於此加以注意全國敎育會議、也定能於此加以注意、（二）次述國民政府施政方針、一爲促進新國民運動、一爲保障治安、一爲增加生產、此爲兩年來致力之所在、亦爲本年元旦所屬望於全國上下共相努力者、尤爲中國參戰以後、所貢獻於大東亞戰爭之工作重點、這三個重點、互相關運、要分工又要合作、要合作又要分工、就生產問題來說、以目前時局之開展、大家應該感覺到興奮、可是爲什麼在興奮之中、還是免不了露着愁容、眉頭深鎖呢、這是因爲生活的壓迫、物價之高漲、糧食之困苦、生產民衆擁有物資比較還好、一般薪水階級、如士兵、如公務員、如敎育家、尤其是一般小學敎職員、他們的困苦、眞可說到了極點、我們應該記着、他們臉上的愁容，也就是我們臉上的愁容、他們心裏的痛苦、也就是我們心裏的痛苦、孟子說、「無恒產而有恒心者　士爲能」、這因有賴於精神上的鼓舞、然就一般來說、物質條件、也是急待解决的、接着主席說、增加生產有三個條件、一是生產的數量、一是交通的便利、一是人民的負担、中國的糧食、事變前本來已不足供應、加之以戰爭期間旣無輸入、而兵燹之後、農村破產、耕地荒蕪、生產復形减退、這是一個現實問題、絕不是空口說話、所能挽救的、至於交通上以及人民負擔上、有些是不得已的原因、有些是可以努力避免的、說至此、主席舉封鎖政策爲例、來做說明、渝方旣藉其所濫發無價的法幣、吸取物資、欲盡致同胞於死地、而一無所顧、我們於此、除嚴厲施行封鎖之外、別無他途、這是不得已的、主席在說生產問題的時候、語語沉痛、其結語謂、我們對於不得已的痛苦、惟有全國上下、拿出勇氣、刻苦的去忍耐、去接受對於可能避免的痛苦、亦惟有全國上下、拿出勇氣、努力的去解除去克服、目前那一個國家、不在捱痛捱苦之中、不只交戰國、中立國也是一樣、不只戰敗國、戰勝國也是一樣、中國何能例外、所以我們今日惟有合政府與人民的力量、一方面忍受不得已的痛苦、一方面解除可避免的痛苦、惟能忍受痛苦、才能解除痛苦、主席說明生產問題之後、再就治安問題、扼要的加以說明、喚起與會者之共同注意、最後主席、就促進新國民運動一點說、在此時局開展之中、得到　邦種種之善意援助、我們正走上一條可以求中國之自立、求東亞之解放的大道、今日能否自立起來呢、全靠吾們對於新國民運動的努力、我們所負的責任、如此重大、我們應該自問、我們的學識如何、我們的科學技術如何、技術之外、最重要的是人格的、修養的又如何、我們怎樣才能擔負得起這重大的時代的責任呢，說至此、主席更鄭重的說、所盼望於第三次全國敎育行政會議的沒有別的話、唯期同心協力、促進新國民運動、主席並特別指出過去的敎育、只知把學問知識灌輸於學生、至於怎樣爲社會服務、爲國家效力、不聞不問、這是不對的、學問是一種武器、這武器可以用來使人類向上、也可以用來使人類毀滅、只看這次大戰、天天在消耗世界的精華、究竟是人類在向上呢、還是在毀滅呢、我們將學問知識、灌輸給一般學生、就是將一把刀交給他、他拿了這把刀、殺同胞殺同種呢、還是保衛國家保衛東亞呢、我們於此如何能够不聞不問、我們且不問他會不會使用這把刀、看要問他怎樣使用這把刀、使用去做什麽、新國民運動簡單一句話、就是要確定了一個前進的方針、集中力量、增進力量、依着這方針、一步一步的前進、敎育家所負的責任、不只是供給靑年的知識、更要指示靑年的方針、集中靑年的力量、增進靑年的力量、在這方針上、共同奮鬥、須知道個人主義的時代已經過去了、在全體中義的時代、大家要知道沒有健全的細胞、不會有健全的全體、然而任何細胞、不能離全體而獨立生存、這是每一個靑年每一個國民所應明白認識的、今日是死中求生、亡中求存的時候、怎樣求生怎樣求存呢、第一要認定方針、第二是團結力量、興復中華、保衛東亞、是救亡圖存的唯一方針、方針旣定、便要全國民衆、全國靑年、有組織有訓練有紀律、方能擔負起遂行方針、達到目的工作、這便是新國民運動的使命、主席對於此次敎育行政會議、華北上海各地敎育行政負責人員、以及敎育專家、與前次全國經濟會議一樣踴躍參加表示十分欣慰、期望一心一德、接受新國民運動努力推行、共同擔負起死中求生、亡中求存、興復中華、保衛東亞的大任、</p>

<p>（沮利希田口特派員十九日發）據突尼西亞戰綫方面最近情報中部地區美軍確已遭受重大損害。美軍被迫在南部後退八十公里，北部五十公里，又喪失重要航空基地三處，放棄斯貝特拉，菲里阿那，伽富薩要　，堆積於斯貝特拉陴地後方之大景武器彈藥，亦因德軍俯衝轟炸機之追擊，全數委棄。目前美軍防衛義自斯貝特拉，菲里阿那之後方連結台貝蕯南部而成曲綫，此地段位於及里特　湖之北？爲部分的山岳地帶。</p>
<p>英國報紙亦承認事態之惡化與損失之重大，羅美爾將軍集中共鐵甲部隊强襲斯貝特拉，伽富薩。將軍在埃及戰爭中使用之沙漢戰術復見於此地，現正後退中之艾森霍　軍右冀不能不作更大的退却。</p>
<p>但柏林方面視此次戰鬥僅爲局地的戰鬥，十八日德軍當局關於突尼西亞戰局稱：</p>
<p>菲洲戰局最近之特徵爲羅美爾軍於突亞西亞領域之集中，及軸心軍橋頭堡壘之擴大强化，迄今尙夫有大規模之作戰活動。</p>
<p>唯反軸心方面對此局地的戰鬥極爲重視，如英國少校希巴特稱：此次德軍之進出阻止反軸心軍之攻勢，因反軸心方面攻勢之遲延，致予德軍以有利時機。</p>
<p>又据上海特電，關於突尼西亞戰况，十九日義軍公報發表稱，軸心軍占領伽富薩，及斯貝特拉，在此次戰役中俘虜敵兵二八七六人，破壞裝甲車，戰車一六九輛。另据美國方面消息，美第五軍之損害達其全兵力的百分之二五至三三，尤以戰車部隊之損害更甚，技術上暫時已不能活動。艾森霍華計劃連絡美第五軍及英第八軍之企圖，全被粉碎，在戰略上極堪重視。</p>
<p>美軍殘剩部隊，向台貝蕯四周山岳地帶潰退中，在菲里阿那及加賽里努中間之德萊菩德地方曾企圖反攻，亦遭敗北。因美第五軍之大敗，故突尼西亞北部英第一軍之動向頗堪注意，据德方消息，迄目前止，英第一軍並無採取救援作戰之意圖。</p>
<p>一面，英第八軍不出所料，對突尼西亞南部德軍開始大規模攻擊。据德方消息，英第八軍之最精銳部隊，集結於左翼，正在沙漠地帶作戰中，右翼海岸地帶則較爲荏弱。上述沙漠地帶，英軍與軸心軍後衛部隊之間，業已發生激戰，軸心方面，因敵軍進擊遲緩，於達其原定目的後，撤退至已有準備之陣地，戰事目前正在馬萊斯綫突出地帶進行中，突尼西亞南部之軸心軍主力，尙未參加戰事。</p>
<p>（里斯本十九日同盟社電）阿爾及爾夾電，反軸心軍司令部十九日發表：</p>
<p>（一）因德軍二鐵甲師團之急襲，美軍部隊自阿爾及利亞國境後退百餘公里。</p>

<h3 id="c20">德軍新攻勢蠡測 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>（柏林守山特派員十七日發）德國的東部戰綫，蘇聯的西部戰綫，自德軍撤退羅斯托夫，伏洛希洛夫格勒後，戰事徐徐地移向西方。以鐵與石炭著名的重工業地帶唐納茲盆地，已被蘇軍奪還，戰渦今重復波及至德國視爲歐洲的榖倉的烏克蘭平原。德軍的所謂「計劃的撒退」，究竟有無止境深爲一般人所關懷。</p>
<p>依現勢看來，今後蘇軍的可能攻擊期間，尙有五星期，所以德國着手建設的東部占領地省管轄下之民政地區，有被戰火波及的危險。但旣稱爲「計劃的撤退」，則不能不有一定的限度，這限度預定在那一綫呢，我們祇要打開島克蘭大地園一看，自然可以明瞭。</p>
<p>在遍地冰雪的大平原，用人工倉卒築成的陣地，自然不能擋阻如潮　滾滾而來的敵軍大兵　，尤其在運輸機構不完備的戰塲，沒有方法把大險利用作擋箭牌。情勢之所以演化到此地步者，當然，不能不承認出於因勝而怠的德軍之意料，但不能就此說德軍倉皇無措而以至於總崩潰。</p>
<p>越過高加案，頓河流域地區，而深入地後退至烏克蘭的德軍，假使我們感覺到是有計劃的，那不是天才戰術，而是以堅實爲第一的德國防軍傳統的作戰精神，習慣於溫暖氣候下的西歐兵士，在零下二〇度的氣候中，有五體麻痺之感，即在此地却出現了敵軍冬季裝束的機械化部隊。在此塲合，德軍取頑强的姿態，寗死不離，毅然加以抵抗，於是演出了「斯達林格勒的悲劇」，德軍精銳的南方軍，全軍覆滅。而其結果或許是以制全部東戰塲的死命。形勢嚴重至此，大敵當前，前途遍佈荊棘，加以從祖國之人的資源上看來，每一兵士的生命都値得珍視，德國參謀本部在此境况下，寗忍一時的恥辱，而謀將來的榮譽，在憎根與血淚交流中，用悲壯的堅決意志，冷靜地判斷當前的局勢。</p>
<p>德國大兵團超過〇〇公里以上之新記錄的撤退，與向來希特勒的閃電戰術完全相反，但同樣是果斷的行動。希特勒所指揮迄今的軍隊中，未之前見的德軍新面目，將於此可窺。世人鑒於希特勒之祇進不退，今竟有此次的撤退命令，故深致疑惑。但這疑問完全錯了，東部戰綫二年來的苦難的磨練，根本上變更了原來德國的作戰戰略，這是擔任作戰指導任務的人的問題，又爲兵器的問題，更是戰術觀的問題。</p>
<p>紅軍的飢餓攻勢</p>
<p>德國參謀本部今正密切注視大俄羅斯的自然環境，與如謎般不可解的兵士羣，開始從新的角度，檢討怎樣從這二大國民之宿命的鬥爭中爭取勝利。同時，德蘇戰爭於此進入了新階段。德國參謀本部假使依然採取陳舊的作戰觀念，則夏之有於我，正如冬之有於敵，徒然反覆重演爭來奪走的故事而已。而且去年夏季的紅軍，與本年冬季的德軍，同樣都採用退避戰略，所以對於敵方的戰鬥力，不能加以徹底的打擊，終致二敗俱傷，而這却正如英國的私願，德軍的指導者，洞察此中底細。所堪注目者，紅軍目下的冬季攻勢，乃所謂「飢餓攻勢」，已盡傾其最後的戰鬥力，然則在未來的攻勢交換期，期望中的德軍，其新戰術又將如何呢？</p>
<p>閃電戰時代，在後方曉曉不休的外行戰術家，在這重大的戰局之前，沒有話說了。軍人專門家，也　脣無言。在這後方的沉默中。貫流着對德國訪軍的信仰。一般國民對於自負爲歐洲最强軍隊的國防軍，其信賴始終毫無動搖。在報紙上軍事記者的筆端，誠然有反省過去的論調，認爲因錯估紅軍而產生了此次重火的後果。</p>
<p>徹底摧毀戰鬥力</p>
<p>一開始就決定在冬間轉取守勢，曾有人以爲這是劉的。但更多人發生疑問，以爲旣有此冬大軍越〇〇公里深撤至後方的機動力，何不反以此力轉取冬季攻勢。於此，產生了一極爲明瞭的事實，卽因冬季戰的深刻，運帶的變更了國民對於國防　的信仰。可是在蘇聯這樣龐大的戰塲上，斤斤於一城一市的爭奪，毫無意義。若未消减敵的兵力與兵器，不能算　了戰爭之能事。所以在此次德軍的第三次攻勢中，不似去年之以地域爲目標，德軍傾其全力破壞敵的戰鬥力，從此觀點看來，此次的撤退，也正是縮小正面戰綫至最短距離，誘敵至德軍所視為最得意的戰場島克蘭平原，等候陽光晴朗的季節？實施以前閃電的大包圍殲滅戰，用此解釋，聊以自慰。最後，戈林元帥系的報紙所注目的艾森城納奇奧那爾·柴曾克（譯音）報主筆許惠林氏，振其悲憤慷慨的筆調，描述未來德國新攻勢的性質，茲介紹其要旨於此：</p>
<p>「去年夏季德國的攻勢及目前紅軍的冬季攻勢，給與我人重大的敎訓。蘇聯在東部戰綫不是用優秀的戰術和優秀的武器獲勝，這不是質的問題而是量的問題。多量的軍隊，多量的武器，足以左右此次戰爭的歸趨。敵用暴力的手段對我，則我亦不能不以牙還牙，同樣以暴力手段對付。國家總動員令的目標亦卽在此。我們在未來攻勢中，準備了比斯達林格勒史多更良的軍隊，製造了比敵人所有更多更佳的兵器，用暴力對付暴力，用量對付量，用數對付數，來向蘇聯對抗，這是我們新的答覆」！（翔：譯自二月廿日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>爲準備交還租界後的發展，深感當前的上海有一大轉換的必要。百年來中國民衆無時不在盼望的恢復國權，業經日本的斡旋，已經實現，東亞各民族一致矚目新中國的光輝燦爛面目。關於這問題，上海特別市政府稽核宮崎儀平氏發表如下的感言：</p>
<p>「譬如說吧，把日本的山櫻拿到中國來菰植，顏色就要變化。就是說茶吧，縱然是日本最好的茶葉，可是用中國的水來煮，就覺得不香，一般人以爲是上海的水壤，其實中國的茶很好，水也不壞，因爲一地的東西有一地的性格，不能混合雜亂，就是政治，經濟，思想，文化等亦然，把日本的政治，經濟，思怨，文化專業到中國來施行，就雖辦得　了。」宮崎氏在上面的一段話裏，已有了富有含蓄的深意。他接着又說：</p>
<p>中國從前就有所調「包」的制度，到了淸朝末葉，地方官吏如縣知事，把治下的行政稅收，全部承包下來，用一百二十兩的年俸去養一個大家庭和部下，甚至牢獄的經費也要他掏出來。為什么要這樣呢？因爲稅收是他承包的緣故。到了現在，這種風氣在社會生活裏還是根深蒂固的存在着，例如醫生就有一種包醫的制度。所以單看上海，外表上好像是近代國家的都市，其實中國還沒有經過資本主義的過程，所以實施經濟統制，非要用相當的政治手腕去幹不可。和日本有着同樣的情形，要是超速度的進行，就會弄出不合理的事情來。</p>
<p>丁此歷史轉換時期的日本和中國，除了同生共死向建設大東亞共榮圈的目的邁進以外，沒有其他方途。我肥得某一個人這樣說過：中國古來就時常戰爭或則對立，我也是這樣想。而現在中國已經恢復國權，做到獨立自主的一步，這也可以說是從對立中爭取得來的，不過，這個對立，並不是向建設共榮圈的全體對立，是對於不合理方面的抽象的對立。</p>
<p>講到這裏，又轉到了上海特別市政府的發展胚胎上去，他說：</p>
<p>公共租界，法租界交還後的上海，當然加强了特別市政府的權限，最近的中國，尙不能撇開租界，因爲民族資本都逃避在租界裏，這都是眞正中國民族的資本，我覺得這就是現在建設新中國的胚胎，中日兩國人士，從今起就得要有堅定的決心法幹。</p>
<p>宮崎氏僑居中國有二十三年之久，他的容顏靑健，看不出已經六十四歲的高年，他最後又說東亞的曙光已經啟示，東亞民族，已經到了創造偉大新天地的時期了。（雲鵬：譯自二月二十六日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 春曉</p>
<p>法租界警務當局對界內居民之戶口調查業已完竣，身份居住證，亦已完全發竣，現更爲防宵小之徒匿跡界內，確切維持地方治安起見：各區時派警務人員，按保甲抽查戶口，故特規定各戶戶長，須將戶口證懸掛於明顯之處，以便隨時抽查，否則須　章處罰等語，用意至善，但有幾點可否請法租界當局考慮與改善、</p>
<p>（一）戶口證雕懸掛於顯明之處，此對於獨居一宅房屋者，頗爲適合：若對一宅內居　數附戶者，但不相宜，然在上海則獨　此種　。一屋內最明顯之處，即爲客堂，惟在寸金地之上海，客堂多屬出租之例　而戶畏並非一定居　在一屋內之最為明之　，當亦有住於所謂三層擱及灶披間者，而戶口證須懸於顯明處，此則問題發生矣。因戶長住在三層擱及灶披間者，則戶口證當欲懸掛於房客之屋內，以便警員抽查時即可見戶口證。如戶長與附戶若平日無意見，此則不難解決，若戶長與附戶曾有過糾紛者　對方必欲刁難之報復之，如隨意塗改等情，而被當局查悉，定欲處罰戶長，此乃難煞戶長矣。</p>
<p>（二）由保甲長傳令，戶口證　配置鏡架，似不經濟，且亦有弊端，在今日百物飛漲之上海，欲配置一只，如戶口證大小之起碼鏡架，其價格至少須五十元，若人多有二張戶口證者，當須配置二只，則須化費一百元矣　故請來當局略更前議，聽其自由配置，或者代用他物，可由自己用厚紙板作襯底，照覆以玻璃紙，則中間之戶口證可以明白看得出，用可懸掛，所費當可减底不少，而收效相同。月上海五方雜處，宵小猖獗，若戶口證配以鏡架，懸於顯明之處，難免　若　之目的物，失竊之聲，日必數聞，保甲當局與戶長亦必爲重製戶口證，多一番麻煩也。</p>
<p>（三）由上述二點觀之，戶口證似可不必懸於顯明之能，亦可不必配置鏡架，仍由戶長收藏之。如遇警員抽查時，當可囑戶長取出備查，設若將戶口證懸於顯明之處，則抽查時當亦必先叫戶長，故在手續上並無轉手麻煩之不便，又可解決上述二種之因難。</p>

<p>— 選民</p>
<p>英國爲了保持這個「錫的王座」，於一九三〇年利用世界經濟恐慌的浪潮，倡訂國際限制生產協定，由於英國系的錫產國單位之多，將國際委員　中的決議權完全操持自己手中，同時使澳洲，緬甸和南非故意不參加國際同盟，形成一種外綫，從內外兩面操縱協定委員會，完全依自己的利害而決定各國生產，輸出的比率，以支配世界的錫鑛業。</p>
<p>通過橡膠和錫二大重要商品，英國使南洋諸國服屬於馬來。再加新加坡之優越的地理條件，南洋一切產物，都不能不經過新加披再行輸出，於是英國對整個南洋的支配權更加鞏固了。　從馬來的貿易情形來看，馬來半島雖爲原料國，但是輸入的三％爲原料品；而輸入對手國中，又以荷印，泰國，緬甸，印度等原斜國占絕對多數地位。</p>
<p>因此，馬來　成爲英國的金元工廠，而對美國則爲戰時經濟的生命綫。美國也有鑒於此，而與英國訂結棉花樣膠交換協定，並設橡膠儲檟公司，金屬儲藏公司等，不惜高價，從事收購，另一方面又加强限制民問使用，以備軍需　。據最近情報，橡膠的國內儲藏　的爲六十一萬五千公噸，（內政府所有二十一萬五千公噸），但就過去平均消耗量來看，每月約需七萬五千公噸，則僅敷八個月之用。錫也是這樣。在這裏一九四二年度五百九十億美元所謂超龐大軍事預算，結果也沒有用，現在只能依靠玻璃維亞的錫及阿麥森自　的橡膠，而在量和質上面還有絕大的問題。此外，在利比里更栽植橡樹，委內瑞拉山中鄂利諾可河　橡林的發現，也曾喧傳一時，但前者不足法伊挨斯特思一秋之需，後者則因在深山而採運困難。於是，馬來之表失，對英美實在是絕大的痛創。</p>
<p>再看美國重要原料需給狀况如；</p>
<p>（一九三七—三九年平均，單位英噸）</p>
<p>美國所需原料的來源如下；</p>
<p>錫，來自馬來者占百分之七十四，來自荷印者占百分之六。</p>
<p>生橡膠，來自馬來者占百分之五十九，荷印占百分之一十七，西蘭占百分之六，越南占百分之五。</p>
<p>而英國的自給程度，橡膠來自馬　者占百分之六十六，錫來自馬來者百分之八，西非者百分之二十一。</p>
<p>（七）馬來溣忘後民主　國的損失</p>
<p>馬來淪亡後對於英美兩國的損失，僅從上述橡膠和錫二項而言，已很重大。現在更進一步看。第一，馬來的橡膠和錫，向誇爲世界第一，在平時爲重要的工業原料，美國和英國都是高度的工業國，上述兩種原料，正是英國汽車工業，航空工業和罐頭工業不可或缺的物資。但是，作爲軍需資源，其意義尤爲專大，這兩大資源在大東亞戰爭中已隨着馬米之易幟而喪失了！不能小說是英美　後軍備計劃中最重大的創　。</p>
<p>第二，是支配大東亞海洋的政治經濟和軍事的重要根據地新小坡的喪失，這比橡膠及錫兩大資源之喪失，也許更加重大些！因爲從此以後，英美喪失了制覇西南太平洋的中樞基地了，其在經濟上而言，除了上述的橡膠和錫以外，荷印的石油，澳洲的羊毛等等重要而大量的資源，從此便和英美絕緣了！同時，由於對殖民地苛酷的搾取而久吸其甘汁的南洋市塲也跟着喪失了，自然是英美經濟上不易補救的損失。</p>
<p>馬來半島之橡膠生產占世界產額的四成，錫的占三成半，其大部份爲輸出品，而新加坡是南洋經濟圈之支配的中心，荷印，泰國及越南橡膠皮錫也都集中於新加坡，其實際的輸出額，高出於馬來的生產額。輸出的最大顧客就是美國。據一九三九年統計，美國所消費的橡膠之六成及錫的七成四，是從新加坡來的，誠如美國某大報所說；「馬來是台德洛伊特和阿克倫的生命綫」因爲台德洛伊特是著名的福特汽車廠的所在地，而阿克倫又是固特異車胎公司最大工廠的所在地，爲平時橡皮與錫的代表的消費地。而且，近年來這兩個地方都已成為軍需工業的中心地，對於橡膠及錫的消　是自然更加增多了。因此，馬來這二大物資供應的斷絕，對於美國的軍隊，以及仰賴美國供給軍需的英國和其他民主主義各國，不得不同樣受到不良的影響。不僅此也，美國人有大量的罐頭食品消費，日常食糧的半數爲罐頭食品，一年消費的達一百三十億聽。所以，馬來之喪失，不僅使台德洛伊特和阿克倫二地爲之黯然神傷，即全美國人民生活也要受到戚脅。</p>
<p>馬來輸出之第二大顧客是英國本國。不過，在英國，與其說是橡膠及錫等實物，母寗說是把這種實物換到的美國的資金更寫重要。但看一九四〇年馬來貿易，向美輸出爲叻幣五億九千一百五十萬元，由美國輸入爲三千八百萬叻幣，出超達五億五千三百萬叻幣，同美金爲二億六千五百萬美元，這筆巨額的美元資金由於嚴格的外匯管制而是完全流進英國政府金庫去的。也靠了這　款子，英國才能從美國購進飛機大砲，由美國依護航制度，送到英國，成爲英國對德對日戰爭中武器最大來源。怪不得英國人指馬來為金元寳庫，金元工廠；可是，英帝國主義者過去只知自私自利，加强對馬來壓榨，不顧住民的福利，結果一切飛機大砲徒然成爲日軍的香餌，而過去的壓榨政策引起的人民公忿，終於使英國統治者自食其果—英國勢力從馬來給驅逐出來；可是，結果不只是馬來的喪失，而有更不可補償和救治的呢！</p>
<p>華僑在馬來活動，至遲也應該是宋未之際，那時還先是公元十三世紀初期，白人的殖民地爭奪運動，還是幾百年以後的事呢！華僑亦馬來七百多年的經營，不管名義上如何，馬來確實成爲他們的故鄕了！無論在經濟或其他方面，都已有深固的基礎。據一九三九年調　，華僑人口三百三十萬以上，古馬來全人口百分之四十二，一切職業　門，都有華慶　在服務‘，而勢力最盛的是商業部門，華僑投資九億九千萬元中，商業投資佔十分之六，橡膠及錫的投資占三成，華僑資本在錫續方面的投資，雖然比較的少。但是，在馬來錫鑛全部投資額中，却古百分之五十，在在全世界錫產中，百分之十八會在華僑的掌握之中！橡膠也是一樣，橡膠的加功與處理事業，都由華僑在工作主持着，就中福建人有着獨占的地位。我們還應該知道，馬來最大的和近代化的橡膠製品工廠，不是別的，就是閩僑陳嘉庚的陳嘉庚橡皮公司。</p>
<p>華僑在馬來經濟界具有不可動搖的勢力，窘迫的重慶財政，全靠華僑接濟而不至於崩潰。大東亞戰爭後，接濟斷絕，重慶政權所受的打擊爲如何重大，自不難想像。</p>

<h3 id="c41">低物價政策之根本辦法 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>問工廠主人，歡迎低物價政策乎？曰物價低，則原料賤，其他工資及廠繳，皆因是而减輕。成本旣省，則製造品必易脫手，資本周轉旣速，則獲利必豐，孰有廠主而不歡迎低物價政策者乎？間店主歡迎低物價政策乎？曰物價低，則進貨易，將使批發之價低於零售之價，不復若今之批發貴於零售，若是則帳面之數字雖遂漸减少，而店中之存底實逐漸加豐，論其實際資產，自必有增無减，孰有店主而不歡迎低物價政策者乎？問投機商歡迎低物價政策者乎？日上海之投機市塲，如許其恢復舊態，則三百元可以做一千日圓之交易，兩三千元可以做十件棉紗之交易，二三百元可購金子一條，倘羣知物價之必趨低落，則做空頭者多，且愈做愈覺獲利，同樣可以擭利，亦何必做多頭以提高大衆之生活乎？故投機商亦未嘗不歡迎低物價。然則物價之所以不能低，其癥結所在，決非商人之心理作用有以使之。其最大之原因，在於通貨較多，交通阻梗。欲通貨减少，在於逐漸牧縮通貨，欲交通便利，惟有努力於商船之增加。使南洋中國日本之物品原料互相流通，製造日興，貿易日暢，日减輕途中之税項，則物價不求其低而自低。低物價一語旣爲海內外賢達之所常言，想能於根本辦法上切寬留意，以求其實行。</p>
<h3 id="c42">前日上海工商聯誼會歡迎席工　田尻公使致詞全文 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>昨日上海工商聯誼會歡迎田尻公使席上，公使致詞，本報已略有紀載，茲見大陸新報揭載全文，比較詳盡，爰再迻譯補刊，以饜讀者。　編者註</p>
<p>本會成立迄今，已逾六月，在此半載中，世界情勢巳有極大變化，相信此項變化，對於華中之經濟，有偉大之良好影響與效果。自從中國對英美宣戰後，中國與日本以戰友地位，向共同目的邁進，英美勢力已被完全肅淸，建設共存共榮之新天地於東亞。中國不特於大東亞戰爭發生後協助日本，即在宣戰以前，亦與日本處於昆仲地位，等於一人在疆塲效命，一人在後方留守。但目下中國亦同站於前綫，雖無與日本相等之軍備，但其決心願在前綫駢肩作戰，兩國完全處於同樣之立塲。</p>
<p>因情勢之轉換，恐中國諸公對日思想已有種種改變，我日本人方面之對華思想，亦有極大變化，蓋因過去中日兩方並無以英美爲眞正公敵之觀念，且不甚關心。但自參戰以後，對於此點，已有明確之認識。目前方爲中日兩國移提携於實戰之時期，日本之决心愈堅，此即今日人所稱日本對華新政策之意。</p>
<p>日本聲明交還在華租界，撤廢治外法權，將自可能方面逐次交還。中國方面亦已準備各種接收手續。刻爲準備時期，約在春回大地之時，當可實　。日本之新政策，決非口頭上之空言政策，乃爲實行政策。業已實行者則爲敵產之移交義大利亦已宣佈交還在華租界，法國繼起採取同樣措置。諸位在過去恐亦誤解日本在軍　上，領土上，以至經濟上有征服中國之野心，其實日本之意圖，並非征服中國，始終視中國如兄弟，欲使中國獨立，尊重其自主主權。</p>
<p>其次，關於經濟問題。日本所謂實行新政策，尚未具體表面化，但已在考慮逐漸實行，其時期大約即在春間。上海及華中全域，中日工商界活動之範園最廣，於經濟上之關係尤大，故對於一切失去必要性之限制，將漸次撤消。余在去年十一月來滬，目睹上海之經濟衰微，與內地之關係斷絕，深感驚異，故力謀早日復興上海之經濟，暢通內地之物資，中日工商人士之活動範圍旣廣，則物資移動之限制，當然予以緩和。</p>
<p>爲達到此目的起見，中日經濟界人士，實有携手合作之必要。無論中日人士，不能以個人之特權及優先權爲目標，須以互相推誠合作爲鵠的。第一，過去對於日本工商業者給予特權，實爲最壞之事，亦即極大之錯誤。假使此舉廢除，而今後國府僅將特權賦予華人，亦爲同樣錯誤。第二，現在爲完成戰爭計，無論中日人士，必須盡最善之努力，隨戰爭進展以統制戰時經濟，當然有其必要。此種辦法，不當僅由日本或中國偏面施行，應由日本與國府商妥後實施。</p>
<p>但不容任何人因通商範圍廣泛，而作個人之囤貨，亦不容爲利益計，而爲任意之處理。關於此點，希望工商各界人士，自動籌得妥善之辦法。在目前時期，須力戒有背戰爭目的之情事。第三，不幸今日尚在與渝方作戰，日本軍在中國之廣泛地區縱橫活躍，因之日軍所需之物資，不得不請求優先供給。再觀其反面，日軍則用各種手段助成華方復興經濟，對於物資之收買與運輸，無分中國與日本，皆願儘量予以便利。</p>
<p>關於以上經濟問題，所言雖屬抽象，但相信其必能循此方向推動今後之施策。於此可見日本顯無征服中國之意向，更信中國亦無征服日方經濟之意向。本會爲深切理解中日經濟關係人士之集團，尚須重言聲明者，即新政策必為可能實行之政策。但經濟問題，凡吾人所不能做到者，尚有待於諸位之活動。活動之本身，即在於工商界人士。深盼諸位，密切合作，互相理解，自動奮門，以期收獲偉大之成績。</p>

<p>物價問題已成為當前社會人士討論商榷之中心。本報社評亦會迭次申論物價對策，昨日下午四時，本報「經濟界」李權時，潘仰堯，劉雲舫三君特假新亞建業公司會議室召開荼會招待本市工商界領袖，懇談今後物價對策問題。參加談論者，計到聞蘭亭，林康侯，袁履登，許冠群，失博泉，項康原，王海波，邱良榮，姚仲拔，朱彬元，陳德榮，史子權，張一凡，沈君碩等二十餘位。即席舉行物價問題座談會，彼此交換意見，歸納結論如左：</p>
<p>關於今後物價對策，期望於政府當局者，約有六點：</p>
<p>（一）增加生產原料　原料爲生產事業之主要原素，希望能就和平區域以內所可獲致者，盡量供給，盡量配給。</p>
<p>（二）疏通物資來源　促進內外物資交流爲解決物資缺乏之先決問題，希望調整運輸機構，俾利物資之交流。</p>
<p>（三）注意統制方法　統制貴有伸縮性，以期人民之衣食所需無缺，希望統制方面能有適當之調整，對於人民需要物品，統制放寬，不需要物品，統制加嚴，而日常用品之全面限價，尤望有澈底有效之辦法。</p>
<p>（四）强化同業公會　政府當局亦認商業聯合機構，爲亟當調整，希望强化同業公會，俾各業自行管理，自行檢舉，以爲政府當局之助。</p>
<p>（五）嚴行取締囤積　囤積爲破壞物價統制之工具，希望加强管制規章，嚴行取締囤積。</p>
<p>（六）注意提倡節約　消費之節約爲物價對策中所最不能忽視之一點，希望特別提倡物資之節約，藉以减少物資之恐慌。</p>
<p>深信上述各點，堪作解決物價問題，推進限價政策之參考。最後，希望物價統制處早日增聘本市民間經濟界適當之人物，參加商研物價對策中最有效的實施辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c47">泰國發展農業　　海通社盤谷二十五日電：泰政府決捐款二五〇〇〇〇〇泰幣幫助灌漑，發展農業預計全國將有九千平方公里之土地，可受其利益。日用品　漲勢驚人　　日用品市面，新高價仍層出不窮。觀察近勢，頗呈漲無止境。如鳳凰牌火柴價爲五千九百元，美麗牌六千二百元，金鼎牌四千四百元，什牌三千一百元。固本皂一千〇五十元，剪刀皂一千元，黃祥茂九白元，白祥茂九百六十元。白禮氏洋燭七百五十元，僧帽牌六百五十元，什牌五百元。漲勢之烈，令人乍舌。收買華中煙葉順利　　本期收買華中烟葉之狀况極佳，估計收買數量已達四萬萬兩，但因中支烟葉會社產量日增，此數　不敷應用，故關係當局極促進更進一步之生產，同時又在設法獲得菲島等處之南方烟葉與山東烟葉，如此積極進行之下，相信香烟原料之供應必能充沛有餘。公債頹勢難挽　市價頻落　　公債行市，昨隨前日之跌勢，繼續下降，因前日丁戊兩種巳打破八十元大關、昨日甲乙兩種，復再打破八十元大關，人心趨疲，頹勢難挽。初做丙種爲四元五角，高至七角，嗣後浮多出脫、遽瀉至一元一角小價，最後又回上數角，約一元六七角。甲種開價即進八十元大關，爲九元五角，小至九元，最後爲九元八角。乙種九元五角，小至七元，最後七元五角。丁種爲七元五角，小至六元二角。戊種爲八元五角，小至七元，最後七元二角。頹勢恐尚未屆止境。軍票稍低　聯鈔步降不已　　咋晨錢業公會拆息，仍懸一角八分，未更。　　昨日軍票稍見下低，結款毫無，供者轉殷，同業互做價退爲五元五角五分三五厘，小錢莊與銀號門市五元五角四分半及六分爲出入價，聯銀券狂跌不止，蓋上兩日津滬匯水最低匯過二元八角七分，近雖回上好三元一角，差低仍巨，故咋經營者由三四角七分，做小至三元三角八分好有買戶，售出三元四角三分，又小一角七分。豆餅期貨　愈做愈高　　昨日豆餅期貨交易，甚爲興盛，業外之投機份子，紛紛雲裏，均視爲逐鹿之樂園，行情愈踢愈高，一致再創空前紀錄。計開：上海廠豆餅二月份交三萬片，價一百廿八元半至一百三十元。又二月底交一萬片，價一百廿六元至一百廿七元半。甡記及利字豆餅三月上交五千片，價一百廿七元至一百廿八元。元隆豆餅六車，價一百廿七元至一百廿七元半。肥字豆餅二車，價一百廿八元，又一二禮拜交三車，價一百三十元。配給期日近　英美煙價步瀉　　香烟市面，英美貨做儈不振，蓋華中組合配給期不遠，致人心虛軟，而價步瀉。日烟與國烟市氣穩疲互見、計：大英牌一萬二千五百元，老刀牌一萬〇五百五十元，品海牌八千二百元，仙女牌八千三百元，五華牌六千九百元，比昨再降二三百元不等。日烟開價，金槍牌三千四百元，金大樓四千二百元。指南牌三千四百云，紅玫瑰二千八百元，全祿牌四千元，廿枝三千五百元。國烟金字塔八千元，美麗牌七千元，金鼠牌四千五百元，白金龍四千八百元，成交頗少。海南圓肉　又到五六百件　　海南圓肉前到之貨，雖久持未開，但昨聞號方消息：又新到五六百件，故市勢稍見平定。號行間已有試行談價，如意思不相懸殊，近日內當有正市。蚊香原料枯乏　生產減售價高　　夏令需銷之蚊香，因產地原料枯竭、生產勢乃减退，是以化學社三星牌行盤爲廿九元九角五分五厘。　係散倉價，以每打計，第一批貨巳告罄，二批貨在要求中。　　西學品市漲勢轉定，蓋一般囤戶視價太高，進者利多害少，故近來開價步跌不已，計頭痛粉四十五元，萬金油五十七元，八卦丹四十五元，鷓鴣菜八十五元，龍虎人丹四十五元。　　「企業週刋」第七期業已出版，內容戰有工商企業界調查資料，極爲豐富。訂閱地點，靜安寺路九九六號企業週刋社。友邦發還軍管理工廠及移交敵產全貌  原桂　　（三）移交之部：　　本年二月八日，友邦當局決定將大東亞戰爭爆發時在華所扣押敵產中的一部份計一〇三件移交國府管理。其中華北計七八八件（屬於產業方面者六八件，屬於文化方面者七二〇件）；華中計二三三件，（屬於產業方面者一〇九件，屬於文化方面者一二四件），總計現值約在五十萬萬元中儲鈔以上。　　茲將華中被移交的屬於產業方面的敵產一〇九件，依其各類數目分列於後：　　至於屬於文化方面的產業，包括學校，醫院，教會，劇塲，俱樂部等。　　茲再將當局所公布之重要產業名稱摘錄於後，藉見一班：　　屬於華中方面者：羅斯福，華順二碼頭，五洲大藥房，華美晚報，大美晚報二電臺，和記洋行，中國化學工業社，怡和絲廠，卜內門洋碱公司，沙利文二廠，上海機器冰廠，美光火柴公司，申新二九兩廠統益等纺織廠，上海惠羅公司，福利公司，美國企業公司，英國製蛋公司，永安，大新，先施三公司，金陵聖約翰二大學，以及英美商旅館等。　　屬於華北方面者：大沽洋行，和記洋行，中美冷蔽公司及燕京大學等。　　爲接管以上敵產，國府最高國防會議已下令組織，「敵產管理委員會」，以財政部長周佛海氏委爲員長。　　（四）發還及移交上的一些問題：　　首先根據上述發還及移交的產業類別，及各類數日看來，輕工業（尤其是紡織工業）佔絕大多數，至於重工業如鋼鐵工業造船工業等爲數很少，亦未見共名稱之公佈。由此可見友邦在工業生產方面所加於吾國之使命保輕工業之生產。最近友邦當局會屢次表示將在本國（日本）集中重工業的生產而計劃把國內輕工業栘到華中來生產，益證此說之不謬了。　　其次，移交的敵產中如中國化學工業社五洲藥房，申新二九兩廠，統益紗廠，華美晚報，永安等三公司原係華人產業，在「八一三」後始假借英美商名義者。因此，移交也可算作發還之一部分。　　再次，移交敵產中的申新一九兩廠已於三十一年五月二十二日作爲軍管理工廠正式發還。大概此係二廠過去曾假借美商名義之故。　　（五）發還和移交後的產業動態及其前瞻：　　發還工廠之經營，多採中日合營方式，如恒豐紗廠發還後與原來的管理受托人大日本紗廠進行談判，決改爲中日合辦，資本額定日金五百萬圓，由中日各出一半。又如章華毛絨公司發還後爲恢復營業起見，乃與日商上海紡織公司合作，改爲上章製絨公司，資本二百萬元，雙方各出其半。　　至於移交的各敵產（廠）目前尚未見作如何處置。惟照頂料，當不外由敵產管理委員會發交各華商經營。在原料資金和技術方面當然仍少不了友邦的幫助。　　要想以過去那種自由主義的方式來經營發還和移交各廠是不可能的。這種觀念就是對於目前我國的戰時經濟體制說來也是有害的。在此大東亞戰爭的緊要關頭，個人的利害必然要放在次要的地位上，一切都是爲了求得戰爭的勝利，雖然我們深信友邦和國府當局是不曾妨碍私人企業的合法利潤的。　　事實上，在嚴密的戰時鹽體制下，一切資金原料，生產，分配，運輸等：都要受到嚴格的統制，個人自由主義的經營方式當然是不可能的，因此我們可以肯定地說：目前中國經濟界必須要和友邦同甘共苦，互助合作，共同爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利！（完）　　蘇俄民間經濟生活之悽慘　衣食住行無一不苦　　二月二十五日瑞典京城電—據新近來自莫斯科之其中立國外交家談稱，蘇俄人民之經濟生活，極爲悽慘。莫斯科城中，祇有兩大旅館，專供政府高級官吏，外交官，及新聞記者居住。平民住宅，凄凉萬狀。政府統制機關，事實上旣不配給燃料，居民紙得捐破自己所有像具，以充燃料。寒冬以來，公園中之樹木，盡被斬伐但所伐木材，盡以供給蘇俄政府高級人員住宅取暖之用。至於民間麪包問題，尤爲嚴重價格更覺驚人，每一基羅格蘭重量之麪包，約值普通一個工人兩星期間所蓄積之工資。市中電車。汽車·以及地底火車，均須獲有特別許可，方能享用，因所有交通工具，均一律爲蘇俄軍政領袖所保留，人民不得染指。該外交家又稱目前，蘇俄婦女已有四千萬人以上被徵，從事於工業與農業上工作。吁輩婦女大都無襪可穿，紙得踝足工作。總之蘇俄人民經濟生活之凄慘，有非　　所能形容。經濟常識股份有限公司設立須知（七）　　丙補行登記及重行登記暫行辦法　　第六條　申請重行登記換發執照之公司，其業務或因事變曾經停頓，或因發展曾經增加資本，致將原訂章程修改者，除備具本辦法第四條規定附件外，應加具修正章程等關係文件；如已增加資本，並應依照公司登記規則第十一條規定，補微執照費。　　第七條　本辦法所稱主管官署，在省爲建設廳，在特別市爲社會局。　　第八條　實業部對於申請事項，如認爲有調查必要時，得派員或令飭當地官署派員前往調查或令申請人補繳證明文件。 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>

<p>自由談新年氣象？  正之　　國曆新年，過去了巳將兩月；廢暦新年，過去了也將一月。可是，我們打馬路上讓過，看多數店眾上午延遲到十點鐘開門，下午提早到三四點鐘打烊；覺得新年氣象，今年比往年特別地長。　　一針見血地說，多數商店不願顧客拿紙幣去換貨物。商人們把每種貨物都當做「奇貨可居」了。再明確言之，有些商店恨不得關門大吉，實行做囤戶。　　做「囤戶」是法令所不許的，於是有些商人福至心靈，不敢眞正「關門」，而改爲「打烊」了。打烊者，在「關門」與「開門」之間：在「賣」與「不賣」之間。打烊時間越長，老關的貨物便留存得越多，利潤也便越厚；可是一般市民苦了！　　新年早巳過去，如此新年氣象，還不結束，請問更待何時？科學小品皮膚與皮膚病  宏辛　　（一）　　假使把皮膚看做人體一件固定的外衣，那是大錯特錯。在人體無論是奔流不息的血液，或者是堅如磐石的骨格都是活的，每一分鐘在變動着。皮膚，這人體的前衛，更是經常地在工作着。它當稱爲一個專門化的器官，有它自己的血管與神經，具備着多種分泌腺體，以及善於收縮伸展的肌肉。保護頭部的長髮，减少磨擦的腋毛實是它的轉化物。光滑精緻的指甲是便於細膩動作而轉化的。假使人類還要像野獸樣英攫取食物的話，那它仍會變成銳利的爪牙。我們所驚嘆的獸類的角質武器，昆虫的雄偉甲殼，也不過顯露着這平凡外衣售變才能的一面罷了。　　認眞的研究起來，皮膚至少可分二，外面是上皮，防禦的第一綫。劃分人類膚色的鴻溝，也就是存在於上皮基層細胞內的色素。它是作爲防禦光的武器。因此光最强烈的地方，色素也當然愈多。白色人種的色素則是過分的缺少。上皮的基層細胞每天作無數次的分裂生殖，新生細胞自出生日起便是有力的衛士，到一天它的身子枯乾了，它還是用它的包藏着角質素的屍體附着於上皮的外層，不是當着細菌的進路。它的酸性足以撲滅數種微生虫而有餘。它的油質使水分與化學浴液無法浸潤。老的細胞走完了它的最後一步，脫落了，隨着塵垢離開了人體，新生的便躍上去，永遠不會停止。上皮的豐饒的後方是具備着血管，神經，肌肉，脂肪，以及彈性組織的眞皮，它是營養的供給地。皮膚的工作實不僅限於防禦。身體太熱了，它張大了血管，大部血液便奔赴表面去傾瀉它的熱量，使體溫歸於正常。當它受到寒冷的襲擊時，血管都堅縮起來，不使血液暴露，消耗熱力，汗腺也停止了它的活動，肌肉們更小心地拉緊皮膚把可能暴露的面積縮小到最高限度。這是它能管制體溫的明證。它會呼吸，會吸收食物，會分泌皮脂。它有色素，是為了抵禦紫外光對內臓的侵害，但它也沒有忘記利用厚生這一個道理，靠著紫外光它造成了維生素丁。身體內變化又是部分地或全部地反映在皮膚上。因此敏感的醫學者靠了它已發展了一門新的學問，專門研究皮膚在生理病理狀態中變化的學問。　　（二）　　皮膚是經常的與外來的侵襲爭鬥着，對於他應當愛護與尊重。有些人對於癢似乎毫無耐心，任性地，用又長又體的指甲爪，組魯的亂抓一頓，皮膚紅腫起來了，甚至撕破了，流着黃色色的淚，告訴他已經受傷了。可是往往得不到憐惜，一樣的再來一頓抓，接連着是塗上一層「×金油」「×福膏或者是用「×特靈」「阿×林之類來殺一下癢。這樣便滿意了，工作完畢了。病源是否已經除去，自己的壤習慣曾否改正，這些從來不會轉到他腦子裏去。皮膚是受不起侮辱的，你侮辱它它決不會憑着你的意念跑的。它憤怒了，腫張着，發熱着，或者是疼痛地流着黃水。你想信那些有效靈丹嗎？它們眞的適用於無論什麼病，無論什麼條件之下的嗎？有之，那只是「形而上學」的「理念」在作弄你吧。因爲即便特效藥的運用也有着它嚴格的條件的。皮膚的病很多，但假使我們好好的管教我們的手，不輕於用成藥，恐怕很多病會自己好的。假使你要講求淸潔，那末能時時用淸水洗滌已够，千萬不要用藥水「消」皮膚上的「毒」。假使要皮膚更美麗一點，那末還是在整个身體的健康上去着手，因爲皮膚的色澤與彈性是由皮內色素血液的旺盛與否，皮下脂肪的儲蓄等等許多因素來決定的。（酬移助學金）一月份徵文錄取第六名　我的生活—學徒  方川　　大概是去年十月吧！我奉着家長的命令，脫離了學校生活而進入一家老式的「行家」去學業，並且拜了一位「業師」。就從那時起，我便被稱爲學徒了。學徒是比較低幾些的——每個人的心裏，好像都存了這個念頭。因此，「學徒」這個名見，也就一向被人鄙視着。　　母親曾經屢次叮囑着並且告訴我：學生意要比讀薔苦得多，但是，耐着吧！學滿了三年，便有了出路。母親的話是不會錯的，我相信。所以當我未進店以前，我已存下了「預備苦」的念頭，彷彿與判死刑的囚犯，在未上刑塲前，有着同樣的盛覺。　　當我在初進店的幾天中，除了業師會囑咐幾句外，別的先生們當然沒有話說，幾位「老師兄」，也認爲對於新來的師弟，大有觀望的必要。所以當我每做一件事的時候，他們總是在暗裏看着，也不說是好是壞，彷彿監視的樣子，會使你自己覺得不自然起來。到後來日子長了，彼此間才有些認識，於是他們開始把一件件的工作遺傳下來（說遺傳，眞對，每當一個新學徒進來的時候，上面的一個，就把所要做的工作，完全交給他，一代一代的都是這樣）掃地啦，揩賬台啦，沖嗣水啦，量來啦……事情確實不少。從早到晚，一個人做來，決不會有空的時候，使你可以習習字學學算，雖然做業師的規定着每天要習字學算的。　　業師大多數是不好服侍的，我們的一位，當然不能例外，一忽兒要這個，一忽兒要那個，動不動就「笨」或「呆」的罪名加在你的身上，聽了眞有些不服氣。但你敢反抗嗎？要不然，便會叫你「另請高就」打舖蓋回家的。幾個老師兄就更可怕，冷冷的臉孔，整日釘住了你，她叫你作事，差你買物，不論是否公事還是私事，都非依他不可。否則，就該倒他的運了。因爲他們根本就把新進的師弟，當作了「出氣孔」看的。「猪獨」「小鬼」的辱罵聲，時時可從他們的口中聽到。有時受了不白之寃，我眞想到暗裏去痛哭一塲，但有什麼用呢？反而增加了他們譏笑的資料呀！淚水從眼角落下來，立刻拿手帕把它揩去　　這也許是多受凉和多下冷水的緣故吧！天氣一冷，手上足上立刻起了凍瘡，痛癢得簡直不能作事。但因此就可以不做事了嗎？決沒有這般容易的事，依舊照常地工作，照常地奔走。幾位先生們，一天裏二次——早晨，黃昏的買點心，總不能免去，並且少不了是你的事。管他是今天雪下得多麼大，風刮得這樣猛，絕不能因此而遠命。片片的雪花，陣陣的西北風，襲在潰爛着的凍瘡上，在隱隱作痛，眞有說不出的苦楚。奮鬥！咳！爲生活而奮鬥！　　假使今天客人衆多，吃飯不能飽，亦成爲最擔心的一件事。一個極短的時間中，添了七八次的飯，絞了三四把臉水，任你飯吃得怎樣快，總不能使你吃上兩碗。小伙子有的是好胃口，怎麼够。餓着肚而奔走，眞是要命。吃點心嗎？老實說，些微的收入，剃頭洗衣還不够。那兒來的錢？　　師母太太住在我們的樓上，事情便越發多了。差東差西不用說，一天到晚有做不完的事會叫你幹。做錯了，省不了一塲辱罵，刻毒的辱罵，聽見子會使你掉下淚來。「他媽的，學生意簡直是做茶房。」在無可忍受的情况下，會發出這樣的怨聲來。我眞不相信學生意的意義在於何處？倒底學了些什麼？是不是存心予靑年的心一下摧殘？還是要培植有爲的靑年，養成刻苦耐勞的精神？否則，幹嗎要學生意。　　近來事情益發多了。軋糖，軋油少不了有着學徒的事。先生們只知道高蹺脚兒說着朝南話，一句使喚，管叫你忙了一半天。他們只曉得一句吩咐便有着一件效果，根本沒有想到「軋」是不是件容易的事。所以當買不着回來的時候，一頓「排頭」是免不了的事。你想有什麼辦法？　　總之，我的學徒生活，脫不了一個「苦」——說不盡的苦。但我相信母親的話：耐着吧！學滿了三年，便有了出路。所以我忍耐着——期待着未來的出路。空氣的秘密  希文　　在巴黎紀念拿破侖的馬格達倫教堂的前面，有一個高聳的銅像，這就是近代化學的建設者——拉瓦錫。上面的碍文是：　　他是向自然進攻，第一個建立很大功續的人，在一七七四年，用了十二天十二夜的不斷的努力，終於正式攻破了空氣的秘密，錫開了物質在空氣中燃燒和許多變化的底細，破除了許多迷信，給後來的化學家打開了研究的門。　　「空氣是什麼？」在從前人們的回答是：「空氣就是空氣。」拉瓦錫決定把空氣審問一下，這個沒有影子的怪物到底還有什麼秘密？　　他審問空氣的方法是很不客氣的，首先在一個曲頸的玻璃瓶裏放了一些水銀，再把這瓶的長頸，伸進一個倒下在水銀槽裏的玻璃鐘罩中，於是空氣便被圍困在曲頸玻璃瓶和鐘罩內，外面的空氣是無法來搗亂援救的。　　裝好以後，他便把這曲頸玻璃瓶，放在火爐上用火刑來拷問它了。假如我們把這些被包圍的空氣，放火一萬萬倍我們將看到自然的物質，在我們手裏是多可憐的被征服者！空氣的分子放大一萬萬倍。大概可以像一個小跳蚤（分子的直徑大的是一萬萬分之一公分），在這玻璃瓶和罩裏，就有幾千萬萬個活活的跳蚤（分子是在空中不停地飛行運動的）被囚禁着，下面的火，逼着她們非常急亂地東跑西跳，非把秘密吐出不可！　　這樣，經過十二畫夜的火刑，拉瓦錫終於得到空氣的秘密了。一方面，在曲頸玻璃瓶裏的水銀上，起了一層紅粉，在水銀槽裏的玻璃鐘罩裏，水銀上昇了大的五分之一，表示裏面五分之一的空氣是被消滅了。　　拉瓦錫第一步便來試一試，在鐘罩裏剩下的氣，到底和空氣有什麼不同？劃着一根洋火，在空氣裏燃燒得很好，但是，奇怪！這根洋火放進鐘罩裏，便立刻熄滅了。這不是空氣了——或者說，空氣裏使東西燃燒的氣消失了。　　顯然，這在空氣中使東西燃燒的氣體，是躲到那些紅粉裏面去了。於是，他便把這些紅粉取出來用便高的熱來燒，果然有氣被趕出來了，紅粉，漸漸變成了水銀。他把這些氣收集起來，用點著的洋火去試，一放進去，便發出雪亮的光輝來，甚至吹熄了，只剩下一點火星，到裏面又能撲的一聲著了起來。　　這是多麼奇妙的發現！　　這個籠罩着我們，像汪洋大海包圍着地球，沒有影子的怪物空氣，終究被我們征服了，在我們面前馴服地顯出了原形，空氣中不幫助東西燃燒的，我們叫它做氣，幫助燃燒的叫做氣。（酬移濟貧金）　　安東尼·羅倫·拉瓦錫　　一七四三——一七九四　　近代化學的建設者萬世師表  James　Hilton著　依今譯　　在前門口，他握着手。　　『再會，我的孩子。』　　回答來了，尖銳的最高音：「再會，吉普斯先生。……』　　吉普斯再坐到火爐邊，他的耳朵裏還響着那幾個字。『再會，吉普斯先生。……」一次老騙事，叫新學生想他的名宇果然是吉普斯；這笑話差不多又成了傳統。他不以爲意。「再會，吉普斯先生。……』他記得，在他結婚的前夜，加娣也會用過遭句話，輕輕地取笑他那時的莊嚴態度。他想：現在沒有人會說我莊嚴了，那是一定的。……　　突然，眼淚開始從他頰上滾下來—一個老年人的短處；也許是蠢的，但是他沒有辦法。他覺得很疲倦；對林福德談話似乎已很費他的氣力。不過他高興他遇見林福德。好孩子。會做好的事情的。　　點名的鐘聲，顫抖地，悶沈沈地從挾着濃霧的空氣中傳過來了。吉普斯向窗子看看，外面在由灰色變成晤色；這是點燈的時間了。但是他正想動一動的時候，却覺得他不能够，他太疲倦了；不過，不論怎樣，，這是不要緊的。他向後，靠上了椅子。不是，乳臭小兒—呃，—這是很對的。想到林福德是很有趣的。對付那些送他來的人，這辦法眞好。再會，吉普斯先生……雖然這是奇特的，他一定要像那樣地說。……　　（十八）　　他似乎會睡過一下，等到他願過來，看見自己已經在未上了；牟里阜爾在那裏，府身在他的上面，在微笑着。「唔，你這老寶貨—覺得好了麼？你眞叫我們吃了一驚—」　　吉普斯喃喃地說着話，停停一下，用微弱得使他吃驚的聲音說。『爲什麼—嗯—什麼—什麼事情發生了？」　　『就不過你暈了一下。威葛特夫人走進來看到了你—幸而她來了。你現在好了吧？寬心些。如果你覺得需要，就再睡着吧。』（四十八）社會服務兩個失業者呼籲　望社會人士予以同情　　我名溤其熙，年十七，本在思源中學高二肄，因前年大東亞戰事爆發，外洋輪船大減，父親任職之報關行停頓，父親失業，我亦輟學，迄今一年半矣。在此物價飛漲之時，一家四口，難以維持。父母當託親友代我找職業，但至今無着。現在我們日常生活如煮飯等均由我與弟弟兩人照料着，因為父親年老衰弱，母親則常年患着劇烈的氣喘病，巳歷十五年矣，偶然間學奧着煤氣，就會引起氣喘。我早上料理家事，午後往圖書館閱醫，晚飯後，去

<h3 id="e1">On Education in Primary and Secondary Schools: Expectations for the Third National Education Conference (Part 3) <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Primary and secondary school education is the foundation of a nation’s education. Therefore, no modern powerful nation has failed to devote meticulous thought and effort to establishing a solid foundation for primary and secondary school education. Over the past decade or so, our government cannot be said to have paid no attention to primary and secondary school education. However, the biggest drawback lies in the excessive emphasis on superficial novelty and disregard for the actual needs of the nation and society. Consequently, the education system has been constantly reformed, but the practical results of national education are difficult to achieve. The prevalence of illiteracy remains the same, and primary and secondary school graduates are still largely ignorant of the current situation and their responsibilities to the nation and society. Although we cannot say that the past educational authorities and those who managed primary and secondary school education have made no achievements through their painstaking efforts and arduous struggles, the fact that their achievements are insufficient to meet the needs of the nation is undeniable. In recent years, the country has been plagued by many disasters, the people have been suffering, and there is a general sense of decline in culture and education. In some large cities, the gap between name and reality is still large in what has been restored, while in small cities and towns, there are even fewer national schools. Only a few dedicated people in the local areas have established village schools and private tutoring institutions, reading ancient books to show that learning has not ceased and to comfort the hearts of fathers and elder brothers. As for how effective it is, I am afraid they have little time to consider. The state of national basic education has reached this point. How can we not feel disheartened when we consider the future of the nation and its people?</p>
<p>The biggest problem at present is the widespread phenomenon of school-age children being out of school across the country. If this serious phenomenon is not addressed first, then any reform of the education system, control of education, and review of the curriculum will inevitably be like scratching an itch from outside the boot, merely dazzling with paper and ink. Therefore, the primary task at present is to popularize primary and secondary education: (1) The existing primary and secondary schools should be restored rapidly, starting with those established by the provinces and counties, and then the existing private schools should be encouraged and assisted in their restoration. (2) In all townships and cities where public order has been restored, national schools and junior and senior high schools should be established as needed by the residents, under the auspices of the county, city, and provincial authorities. (3) In view of the reality that the cost of schooling is too burdensome for the children of ordinary people, all public schools should establish more free and half-fee places. Although it may not be possible to achieve this completely for the time being, primary schools should account for two-thirds of the places, and secondary schools should also exceed half of the places. For private schools, on the one hand, the collection of tuition fees and miscellaneous fees should be forcibly reduced, and on the other hand, the government should provide sufficient subsidies. (4) In areas where the work of clearing the countryside has come to an end, the compulsory education system should be implemented immediately. All school-age children, regardless of gender, must attend school, and those with particularly poor family circumstances should be given subsidies.</p>
<p>In order to popularize primary and secondary school education, the above points must be implemented immediately. Of course, in the process of implementation, the first problem that arises is the lack of teachers. This problem existed before the incident, but it has become particularly serious recently. Firstly, due to material living conditions, the income of primary and secondary school teachers is actually not only insufficient to support their families, but often insufficient to maintain their own lives. Therefore, those with slightly better means or particularly excellent abilities leave for other jobs. The school authorities have no choice but to settle for second best and fill the ranks with unqualified people. As for those who are both knowledgeable and dedicated to education, they are only a small number with a particularly strong sense of responsibility, who do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to cultivate talents for the society and the nation, but they are ultimately "rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns," and it is impossible to expect them to last. Secondly, teacher training has failed to develop and new teachers have failed to grow since the incident. At present, on the one hand, it is necessary to immediately expand teacher training at all levels, increase the number of teacher training schools in each province, city, and county, and improve the methods of rewarding teacher training students, so that the state guarantees the future of teacher training graduates. On the other hand, what is more urgent at present is for local governments at all levels to increase the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers. The salaries of primary and secondary school teachers should be determined according to the local price level. At the same time, subsidy measures must also be specified for the families of teachers. Only when the minimum living standards of teachers are guaranteed can they be able to teach with peace of mind, so as to improve the efficiency of primary and secondary school education.</p>
<p>The third problem in primary and secondary school education at present is the problem of teaching materials. In the past, too much emphasis was placed on textbooks, and teachers and students were tied to textbooks and papers all day long, so that students were ignorant of international, national, and real social issues. After leaving school, they "returned everything they had been given to the teacher." To be a person and to participate in social activities, they had to relearn everything. Frankly speaking, this is the bankruptcy of national education. Therefore, the content of future teaching materials must be connected with the reality of the international and national situation, must be connected with the trend of the times, and must be connected with practical social issues, so as not to bind students and teachers to textbooks. Secondly, regarding textbooks, the newspaper's editorial yesterday has already said it. We hope that this education conference will also give it careful consideration to meet the needs of primary and secondary school education. The current stagnation of major publishing companies in Shanghai is naturally a loss to national education. How the education authorities should assist in their recovery is also one of the urgent and important tasks at present. Moreover, in addition to textbooks, the editing and publication of supplementary reading materials should also be encouraged. Textbooks should be edited according to the country's long-term plans, and cannot be completely based on the current participation in the war to compile a set of wartime readers. However, supplementary reading materials can adopt more wartime materials to improve the efficiency of wartime education.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to ensure the survival and development of our nation, primary and secondary school education must pay attention to cultivating healthy young citizens, so that they have the basic qualities of independence, self-reliance, and overcoming all difficulties. Therefore, militarization must be taken as the central goal, and a disciplined life must be strictly enforced, so that every student's life is rigorous, their manners are appropriate, and all their actions are in line with the cultivation of a complete personality, and they can take on the responsibility for the nation and the people. Students should be immersed in a disciplined and orderly atmosphere from morning till night, and develop the habits of being neat, clean, simple, plain, quick, and reliable, as well as the self-awareness and spontaneity of being responsible and abiding by discipline. Thus, in personal life, they will have the ability to be independent, autonomous, and handle practical affairs, and in collective life, they will become active, hardworking, and cooperative members of the construction of the country and the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>Primary and secondary school education is an important factor that determines the future destiny of the nation. We sincerely hope that this education conference will pay attention to the above points and formulate appropriate countermeasures.</p>

<p>Chairman Wang's Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) The main points of Chairman Wang's instructions at the Third National Education Administration Conference are as follows: (1) First, he discussed the development of the current situation. On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. On the same day, our friendly nation Japan returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights. Following this, Italy and France also implemented the same. Facing the development of the current situation, we need the continuous efforts of the entire nation, both spiritually and materially, to seek continuous progress. Today, the Third National Education Administration Conference is being held. Looking forward to the overall situation, on the one hand, we must recognize the development of the current situation, and on the other hand, we must feel the great responsibility. Do not let down the development of the current situation and fall into the difficulties of the future again. The National Economic Conference and the National Military Conference have paid attention to this, and the National Education Conference will also pay attention to this. (2) Next, he described the National Government's policy guidelines, one is to promote the New Citizen Movement, one is to ensure public security, and one is to increase production. This is where we have focused our efforts for the past two years, and it is what we expect the entire nation to work together on this New Year's Day, and it is also the focus of our work in contributing to the Greater East Asia War after China's participation in the war. These three focuses are interconnected, requiring division of labor and cooperation, and cooperation and division of labor. Taking the issue of production as an example, everyone should feel excited about the development of the current situation. But why, in the midst of excitement, can we not avoid showing a sad face and frowning? This is because of the oppression of life, the rise in prices, and the difficulty in obtaining food. The general salary earners, such as soldiers, civil servants, and educators, especially the general primary school teachers, can truly be said to be in extreme difficulty. We should remember that the sadness on their faces is also the sadness on our faces, and the pain in their hearts is also the pain in our hearts. Mencius said, "Only scholars can have constant hearts without constant property." This depends on spiritual encouragement, but generally speaking, material conditions also need to be resolved urgently. Next, the chairman said that there are three conditions for increasing production: one is the quantity of production, one is the convenience of transportation, and one is the burden on the people. China's food supply was originally insufficient before the incident. In addition, during the war, there were no imports, and after the war, the rural areas went bankrupt and the arable land was barren, and production declined again. This is a realistic problem, and it cannot be saved by empty talk. As for transportation and the burden on the people, some are due to unavoidable reasons, and some can be avoided through effort. At this point, the chairman cited the blockade policy as an example to illustrate. The Chongqing side is taking advantage of its worthless legal tender to absorb materials, intending to bring all compatriots to death without any regard. In this regard, we have no other choice but to strictly implement the blockade. This is unavoidable. The chairman spoke with a heavy heart when discussing the issue of production. He concluded by saying, "For unavoidable pain, we can only ask the entire nation to show courage and endure it diligently. For avoidable pain, we can only ask the entire nation to show courage and work hard to relieve and overcome it. Which country is not suffering pain and hardship today? Not only the belligerent countries, but also the neutral countries. Not only the defeated countries, but also the victorious countries. How can China be an exception? Therefore, today we can only combine the strength of the government and the people, on the one hand, to endure unavoidable pain, and on the other hand, to relieve avoidable pain. Only by enduring pain can we relieve pain." After explaining the issue of production, the chairman then gave a brief explanation on the issue of public security, calling on the participants to pay attention together. Finally, the chairman said on the point of promoting the New Citizen Movement, "In the midst of this development of the current situation, we have received various kinds of goodwill assistance from friendly nations. We are embarking on a great road that can seek China's independence and the liberation of East Asia. Can we stand on our own today? It all depends on our efforts in the New Citizen Movement. The responsibility we bear is so great. We should ask ourselves, what is our knowledge, what is our scientific and technological level, and what is most important besides technology, what is our personality and cultivation? How can we shoulder this great responsibility of the times?" At this point, the chairman said more solemnly, "What I hope for the Third National Education Administration Conference is nothing else but to work together with one heart and one mind to promote the New Citizen Movement." The chairman also specifically pointed out that in the past, education only knew how to instill learning and knowledge into students, but did not ask about how to serve society and work for the country. This is wrong. Learning is a weapon, and this weapon can be used to make mankind progress, or it can be used to destroy mankind. Just look at this war, which is consuming the essence of the world every day. Is mankind progressing or being destroyed? When we instill learning and knowledge into general students, we are giving them a knife. Will they use this knife to kill compatriots and people of the same race, or will they defend the country and defend East Asia? How can we not ask about this? We do not even ask him if he can use this knife, but we want to ask him how to use this knife and what to use it for. The New Citizen Movement, in simple terms, is to determine a direction for progress, concentrate strength, increase strength, and move forward step by step according to this direction. The responsibility of educators is not only to provide knowledge to young people, but also to guide young people's direction, concentrate young people's strength, and increase young people's strength, and to fight together in this direction. We must know that the era of individualism has passed. In the era of collectivism, everyone must know that there will be no healthy whole without healthy cells. However, no cell can survive independently of the whole. This is what every young person and every citizen should understand. Today is the time to seek life from death and survival from destruction. How to seek life and how to seek survival? The first is to identify the direction, and the second is to unite strength. Reviving China and defending East Asia is the only direction for saving the country and surviving. Once the direction is set, the entire people and the entire youth must be organized, trained, and disciplined in order to shoulder the work of implementing the direction and achieving the goal. This is the mission of the New Citizen Movement." The chairman expressed his great satisfaction that the educational administrative officials and educational experts from North China and Shanghai were as enthusiastic in participating in this education administrative conference as they were in the previous national economic conference. He hoped that they would work together with one heart and one mind to accept the New Citizen Movement and work hard to promote it, and to jointly shoulder the great responsibility of seeking life from death, survival from destruction, reviving China, and defending East Asia.</p>

<p>Hubei Frontline, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) While the Japanese army units were launching an encircling attack operation against Wang Jingzai's Chongqing army in the triangle between the Yangtze River and the Han River, Major General Su Zhendong, a subordinate of Wang Jingzai, led his troops to surrender and cooperated with the Japanese army to launch a fierce attack on the remnants of the Chongqing army. According to reports, Mr. Su was originally the commander of the 5th Independent Brigade of Wang Jingzai's army. He realized the non-necessity of resistance after witnessing the tyranny of Chongqing and the suffering of the people. On the night of the 16th of this month, he led more than 1,500 of his troops to join the peace camp. He immediately launched a fierce attack on Wang Jingzai's army. The brigade's garrison at Tonghaikou, 4 kilometers south of Mianyang, was once lost, but was recaptured on the 19th, and the 1st Regiment of Wang's army was pressed north of the Dongjing River. Major General Su will now be responsible for the security of Tonghaikou in Mianyang. In recent days, he has been cooperating with the Japanese army to continue launching a fierce attack on the Chongqing army.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Advisor Ishiwatari Delivers Speech in Japan, Explaining Trends in China's Economy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since taking office last November, Mr. Sotaro Ishiwatari, economic advisor to the National Government, has made many contributions to the establishment of economic policies for the National Government's transition from a pre-war system to a wartime system. He came to Tokyo on the 16th of this month to discuss official business and meet with various parties. On the afternoon of the 26th, he met with reporters from the Ostashia Bureau here and explained the trends in China's economic circles after the war, and observed the current situation and future of the National Government in terms of economic, financial, and production aspects. He pointed out that there were things to be expected and strongly stated that Japan's cooperation was necessary to strengthen China's economy. The main points of Mr. Ishiwatari's speech are recorded as follows: First, the overall trend of China's economic circles after the war. At the beginning of the war, the people's hearts seemed to have a slight tendency to waver due to the Chongqing side's repeated false broadcasts, but soon after understanding the Chongqing side's false propaganda, the people's hearts became extremely stable. Therefore, the transition from a pre-war economy to a wartime economy can be smoothly promoted. Although there will be various difficulties in the economy, the National Government has firmly believed and passionately resolved to complete the war and stabilize the people's livelihood as its goals, striving to overcome these difficulties and establish a wartime economic system. For example, the previous announcement of the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Conference was intended to allow a few officials to quickly decide and implement important issues, and among the National Economic Committee, the officially decided matters are mainly to increase food production and facilitate circulation, and at the same time, it can also express the determination to complete the war together with Japan. Second, regarding the previous announcement of the transfer of the first batch of enemy property to the National Government, the National Government decided to establish an Enemy Property Processing Committee to prepare for the processing of the second and third batches of enemy property to be transferred successively. The position of Chairman of the Committee was decided to be held by Minister Zhou of Finance, and an office was established in Shanghai to handle practical affairs in Shanghai. The outline will be decided by Nanjing. Third, it is necessary to respect China's opinions and responsibilities in the economy. Japan now regards this as a fundamental policy, but the Chinese side needs to make considerable preparations in order to be fully active. Therefore, it has now been decided to increase the number of economic advisors in various places. I came here to discuss this issue and request the understanding and cooperation of the Japanese authorities in order to find suitable candidates. Although these candidates are purely hired by the National Defense Agency, liaison with the Japanese side is also indispensable, and the active cooperation of the Japanese is also very necessary. This point is also fully understood by the National Government. Fourth, since China has joined the war, it is necessary to implement a controlled economy in any case, but the situation in China is completely different from that in Japan, so there are many difficulties. However, there are still Chinese-style control methods in China, but it is believed that it is best to have the Chinese implement it and the Japanese assist them. Fifth, the currency issue is also being prepared step by step. There are currently two types of currency in circulation: Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. The exchange rate between these banknotes and the legal tender will also become a problem in the future. The Chongqing side is still using the old legal tender, but because the prices in the Chongqing area are high, the current rate of one to two is still inappropriate. It is quite difficult to apply the method of suppressing prices with officially fixed prices in China, so the full adoption of the officially fixed price policy cannot be expected at present. Sixth, increasing food production has long been a most important issue in China, and the National Government is making its best efforts in this regard. The land reclamation methods currently planned are very promising, but Japan needs to supply land reclamation materials, and increased production with the assistance of Japanese technology is also very noteworthy. Seventh, the National Government's finances have been positively impacted by the recovery of concessions. Income such as viewing taxes and business taxes will all become income for the National Government, but careful research and preparation are still required before implementation. It is still not possible to say for sure. In short, the National Government's finances are rapidly becoming sound, and the work of transitioning to a wartime system is also progressing smoothly.</p>

Friendly relations are maintained throughout, and Prime Minister Pibul is fully trusted. Regarding economic relations, Japan will supply Thailand with the materials it desires within the possible scope. However, Japan is currently exerting all its efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War, and it is hoped that Thailand, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibul, will also exert all its efforts to cooperate with Japan and jointly strive for the final victory of this war.</p>
<h3 id="e9">US Clipper Accident, Many Important Passengers Killed and Injured, First List Announced Yesterday <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The first list of those who were in distress on the Yankee clipper that crashed in the Tagus River on Monday was announced today. The injured include Captain Sullivan, four deputies, a second-class engineer, a helmsman, two radio operators, three male passengers, and four female passengers, including two actresses and one dancer. The only female passenger who escaped was a radio star. A third secretary of the US Embassy in Portugal escaped from the plane and swam to shore, suffering no injuries. Those who died include the first mate and one radio operator. It is reported that there were no Portuguese on board.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington dispatch, Pan American Airways personnel denied the rumor that Soong Mei-ling was among the passengers killed in the clipper accident in Portugal and solemnly pointed out that Mrs. Chiang was not on that plane. As for the claims that US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, former British Ambassador to France Philip, and members of the Soviet military mission to the United States were also among the victims, they were neither denied nor confirmed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - After the clipper crashed on the 22nd of this month, the US Embassy in Portugal requested the Portuguese authorities to keep the details of the accident secret. Therefore, rumors abounded. The US Embassy and Pan American Airways both refused to release the names of the passengers, leading to various speculations. The fact that the plane was flown by the famous pilot Sullivan seemed to be a sign that there were important people on board. According to the latest rumors, the passengers included US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt and Soong Mei-ling, who was visiting Britain. It is said that Polish General Sikorski, who was reported to have died, was only seriously injured. It is widely rumored that Sir Phelps, the former British Ambassador to Germany, who was the Ambassador to France at the outbreak of the war, has also died. It has now been confirmed that the thirteen injured passengers were sent to a hospital in Sete the night after the clipper accident. The police immediately set up a cordon around the hospital, and then moved the injured to a private hospital late at night. News reporters could not inquire about the news, and cameras that captured the situation of the plane crash were confiscated and the negatives were withheld when they were returned. An engineer at the airport received a report from the clipper that everything was going smoothly and that the plane was landing. All four engines of the plane were working fine. After turning left as usual over the airport, the lights suddenly went out and the fuselage crashed into the cliff. The left wing fell into the water first. The 42-ton clipper made a huge noise when it fell into the water, and the waves splashed at the time. It was 6:45 pm. The airport's motorboat immediately sailed to the scene of the accident. Fifteen of the thirty-nine passengers were rescued, one of whom died a few hours later. The public also tried their best to rescue them. Thirteen injured, including four women, were sent to the Sayo Se Hospital. The Portuguese Minister of the Interior went to the hospital to visit, and the Prime Minister, Salazar, also sent an official to inquire about the situation of the injured. It is said that the injured women are American song and dance stars who will perform in Britain and North Africa to entertain the US military.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japan Respects China's Freedom, Will Change Policy Towards China, Will Not Interfere in the National Government's Administration, So As To Advance Together and Strive For Victory <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government declared war on the British and American governments and joined the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer and has made epoch-making progress. In order to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's participation in the war, Japan will also change its policy towards China, so that China and Japan can advance together to strive for final victory. Today's editorial in the Yomiuri Hochi newspaper is entitled "The Transformation of Policy Towards China" and provides a detailed commentary, pointing out that the National Government has obtained sufficient development and self-strengthening capabilities. It states that the responses of the Greater East Asia Minister and the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau in the House of Representatives on the 25th are particularly noteworthy. Because the response has explained our country's policy towards China after China's participation in the war, we only hope for China's independence, freedom, and political development, and hope that China will cooperate with our country automatically under its creativity and responsibility, and our country will never interfere with the National Government's administration. Respecting China's independence and freedom is our country's consistent policy since the Konoe Declaration. This has been repeatedly stated in the China-Japan Basic Treaty and other treaties. The return of military-controlled factories, the return of concessions, and the abolition of extraterritorial rights further prove our country's determination. However, we cannot think that this is the transformation of our country's policy towards China in the future, because from the National Government's return to the capital to today, due to China's insufficient national strength and the chaos after the incident, it is necessary to actively cooperate in military and economic matters. If the National Government obtains a certain degree of development and self-strengthening capabilities, then the National Government should develop based on its creativity and responsibility. Our country, having seen that China has reached this stage, has moved from active cooperation to adopting a policy of respecting China's creativity. In this sense, it can be called a transformation of policy towards China. We deeply hope that our friendly country, China, will adapt to our country's transformation based on the Greater Vehicle, overcome all difficulties, complete the work of self-strengthening, join hands with our country, and strive to realize the Pan-Asianism of China's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Yesterday was the sixteenth day of Gandhi's fast, and his health condition has not changed significantly. This fast will end at 8:00 am next Wednesday, so there is great hope that Gandhi's life will not be in danger. Because Gandhi's condition has slightly improved, the British government in India issued a statement for the first time stating that the anti-British movement has started a new wave after Gandhi's fast. Eight Indians were executed, two were exiled, and four were sentenced to five years of imprisonment for conspiring to murder British and Canadian officials.</p>
<p>Hanoi, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Because Gandhi's body is gradually weakening due to fasting, a prayer meeting was held here on Thursday, attended by one hundred Indian representatives to pray for Gandhi's safety.</p>
<h3 id="e13">US Troops Retreating Towards Algeria <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Mr. Taguchi, a special correspondent in Zurich, 19th) According to recent intelligence from the Tunisian front, US troops in the central region have indeed suffered significant damage. US troops have been forced to retreat 80 kilometers in the south and 50 kilometers in the north, and have also lost three important air bases, abandoning Spetla, Fériana, and Gafsa. A large amount of weapons and ammunition accumulated behind Spetla were also abandoned due to the pursuit of German dive bombers. Currently, the US military's defense is composed of a curved line linking the south of Tebessa behind Spetla and Fériana, which is located north of Lake Jilritt and is a partially mountainous area.</p>
<p>British newspapers also acknowledge the deterioration of the situation and the magnitude of the losses. General Rommel concentrated his armored forces to launch a strong attack on Spetla and Gafsa. The desert tactics that the general used in the Egyptian war have reappeared here. The Eisenhower forces, which are currently retreating, cannot but make a greater retreat on the right flank.</p>
<p>However, the Berlin side views this battle as a local battle only. On the 18th, the German authorities said the following about the Tunisian battle situation:</p>
<p>The recent characteristic of the African battle situation is the concentration of Rommel's army in the Tunisian area and the expansion and strengthening of the Axis bridgehead. So far, there have been no large-scale combat activities.</p>
<p>However, the anti-Axis side attaches great importance to this local battle. As British Major Hibbert said: This German advance has prevented the anti-Axis forces' offensive, and the delay in the anti-Axis side's offensive has given the German army an advantageous opportunity.</p>
<p>According to a special cable from Shanghai, regarding the Tunisian battle situation, the Italian military bulletin announced on the 19th that the Axis forces had occupied Gafsa and Spetla, capturing 2,876 enemy soldiers and destroying 169 armored vehicles and tanks in this battle. According to news from the United States, the damage to the US Fifth Army has reached 25% to 33% of its total strength, especially the damage to the tank units is even worse, and they are temporarily unable to operate technically. Eisenhower's plan to connect the US Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army has been completely shattered, which is extremely important strategically.</p>
<p>The remaining troops of the US military are retreating into the mountainous areas around Tebessa, and an attempted counterattack in De Lepod, between Fériana and Kasserine, also failed. Due to the defeat of the US Fifth Army, the movements of the British First Army in northern Tunisia are quite noteworthy. According to German sources, the British First Army has not intended to take rescue operations so far.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as expected, the British Eighth Army launched a large-scale attack on the German forces in southern Tunisia. According to German sources, the most elite units of the British Eighth Army are concentrated on the left flank and are fighting in the desert area, while the coastal area on the right flank is weaker. In the aforementioned desert area, fierce battles have already broken out between the British army and the Axis forces' rearguard. On the Axis side, because the enemy's advance was slow, after achieving its original objective, it withdrew to a prepared position. The battle is currently taking place in the Mareth Line salient, and the main force of the Axis forces in southern Tunisia has not yet participated in the battle.</p>
<p>(Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency) Algiers cable, the anti-Axis forces headquarters announced on the 19th:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the sudden attack of the German Second Armored Division, US troops retreated more than 100 kilometers from the Algerian border.</p>
<p>(2) The elite German forces, led by 50-ton tanks, have recovered 4,000 square miles of territory in four days. The damage to the US military, in terms of personnel and materials, is very significant. (Translated by Xiang from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 21st)</p>

<p>Stanford, 26th (Allied News Agency) According to news from New Delhi, the headquarters of the US Expeditionary Force stationed in India announced that the US Air Force base in Assam Province was bombed by Japanese aircraft, but the losses suffered were not mentioned.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Allied News Agency) According to news from Washington, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing announced that the US airfields in China, which were used to bomb Japan, have encountered severe military obstacles due to large-scale bombings by Japanese aircraft. Song also stated that the strength of the US military is "the most important factor" in the current military situation in China.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) According to a cable from Ottawa, the Canadian Foreign Ministry claimed on the 25th that Soong Mei-ling is scheduled to visit Canada in late March, but this visit is not for negotiation or to deliver a speech at a joint session of the two houses.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) According to a cable from London, Xiong Shihui, a military envoy from Chongqing, failed to negotiate for increased aid weapons in the United States. He passed through London on his way back to Chongqing. On the 25th, he and a British spokesperson jointly hosted a group of reporters at the British Intelligence Department. Many special correspondents from various countries attended. Xiong expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of sincerity of the British and American countries, and said that if they let things take their course, Japan would become stronger. Therefore, he repeatedly asked Britain and the United States to provide assistance as soon as possible. At that time, a certain special correspondent first asked whether he was satisfied with the results of the visit to the United States. Xiong replied that he could not be satisfied until the final victory was achieved. He explained the situation of insufficient aircraft in Chongqing, saying that Chongqing's aircraft were supplied by the Soviet Union and other countries before the war, so it had a considerable number of air forces, but its strength has declined day by day since then. He then explained the strength of Japan's military power, saying that even if the German army failed, it would be very difficult for the anti-Axis countries to defeat the Japanese air force, and there was a need to carry out a long-term battle, because Japan's national strength, not to mention manpower and material resources, was gradually increasing in terms of its finances and other aspects. Japan has gained a more advantageous position after occupying Nanyang and has more resources. Therefore, Japan's combat has not shown any signs of weakening, and its morale is becoming more prosperous. At this point, the reporter asked whether, if the European war ended, Britain and the United States could bomb the Japanese mainland with superior air power. Xiong strongly opposed and said that he had heard that some people advocated bombing the heart of Japan with the cooperation of the fleet, but the ideal was good, but it was not known that Japan had occupied many strategic locations, and it was quite impossible to break through these strategic locations. At that time, the anti-Axis forces could only use aircraft carriers, and aircraft carriers could not be said to be unsinkable. Finally, when he talked about the Indian issue, he criticized the British government, saying that Chongqing expressed deep regret for the current situation and hoped that the British government would quickly find a way to resolve the Indian issue satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the news of Gandhi's arrest spread, the world's small and weak nations have been outraged. Gandhi deeply understands the insidious intentions of the British, and it is not easy to escape from the tiger's mouth. Therefore, he fasted to show his indomitable and great revolutionary spirit. Our country is in the midst of striving for the liberation of the Greater East Asia War, and we will spare no effort for the liberation of the East Asian nations. India is one of the largest nations in East Asia, and the people of the whole country are extremely concerned about India's independence and Gandhi's health. The capital circles are scheduled to convene a capital people's conference to aid India's independence at the National Assembly Hall at 3:00 pm on March 1st. At that time, representatives of the Indian independence movement will be invited to Beijing to participate, and the facts of British oppression of India will be thoroughly exposed.

<p>German Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German military report stated that the weather in the Kuban bridgehead and the Mius area remained warm. Yesterday, there were only localized battles. Enemy forces southwest of Izyum, unable to withstand the German pressure, are fleeing north and northeast. Several Soviet units are isolated, and others have been defeated. The number of prisoners and captured materials is increasing daily. Our forces west of Kharkov and Kursk are fighting against advancing enemy troops. Our fighter squadrons routed enemy tank columns and troop concentrations. Enemy railways and highways were bombed, severely affecting logistics. Battles are taking place both north and south of Orel. Soviet forces have launched offensives with fresh troops and tank columns, but have been largely repelled, with heavy losses in personnel and tanks. Enemy forces south of Lake Ilmen launched an infantry attack supported by tanks, but ultimately retreated due to heavy losses. South of Lake Ladoga, our forces advanced, achieving their intended objectives. Enemy counterattacks were ineffective.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 26th (Havas News Agency) - On the Eastern Front, the Soviet forces' offensive has been greatly weakened due to the thaw and recent vigorous German counterattacks. German forces have regained the initiative in several major battlefields. The fighting in the Donets River basin was concentrated yesterday around Kramatorskaya. The German defensive battles have now turned into counteroffensives, a fact acknowledged by the Moscow war report. The Soviet war report also stated that they had retaken several locations southwest of Voroshilovgrad and occupied an important town west of Rostov. These battles are of a localized nature. As for Orel, Soviet forces continue to launch offensives against German lines but have made no progress. German and Soviet tanks are clashing day and night.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - According to British military sources, the Soviet winter offensive is nearing its end. Swedish newspapers have learned that British military and political circles are paying close attention to the battles in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Moscow dispatches often refer to "the fiercest battles" and "the resistance in the Donets Basin." The London "Daily Telegraph" Moscow correspondent reports that the German counteroffensive in the Donets Basin has intensified. While it has not resulted in significant territorial gains, it has halted the Soviet advance towards Krasnoarmeysk and Kramatorskaya. According to another Moscow dispatch, German forces southwest of Kramatorskaya, with the support of artillery and aircraft, broke through Soviet lines, forcing the Soviets to move their front lines back several kilometers. In the Orel sector, German resistance is strong, resulting in heavy Soviet losses. The Germans have concentrated large forces in the area, including multiple armored divisions. The Germans have built strong defensive fortifications on the Moscow front, which were already in place in 1941. Furthermore, Moscow dispatches reported by the British repeatedly mention that the thaw has begun on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, affecting Soviet operations there. A "Exchange Telegraph Company" Moscow dispatch states that the battle zone on the southern sector of the Eastern Front is expanding, and the Soviet position is becoming increasingly difficult due to their rapid advance.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - On the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the German counteroffensive in the Donets Basin and along the Dnieper River is progressing smoothly. The intensity of the Soviet attacks on German positions at Mius has diminished. Many elite Soviet units have been encircled and annihilated in recent days, causing them to lose their vitality and initiative in the area. Currently, the Soviets are only using reserve troops to hold their positions and resist the German counteroffensive between the Donets and Dnieper Rivers, without launching offensives, indicating the weakness of their forces. Therefore, the German counteroffensive is making good progress, approaching the important railway hub southwest of Izyum. Northwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces are attacking Konotop in two directions, but the situation is unclear. The pressure exerted by Soviet forces on the Orel front has also decreased, and the Soviets have made no progress to date. Fighting continues southwest of Kaluga, with the focus on Sukhinichi, but it has become localized. During the attack on the city of Bryansk, a Soviet tank column included twenty American tanks, most of which were destroyed by German forces.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Speculations on the New German Offensive <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Berlin by Shoushan, Special Correspondent, 17th) Since the German forces withdrew from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, the battles on the German Eastern Front and the Soviet Western Front have gradually shifted westward. The Donets Basin, a heavy industrial area famous for its iron and coal, has been recaptured by the Soviet forces. Now, the flames of war are spreading again to the Ukrainian plains, which Germany considers the granary of Europe. People are deeply concerned about whether the German "planned withdrawal" has any end.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, there are still five weeks left for the Soviet forces' possible attack period. Therefore, the civil administration areas under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Occupied Territories Province that Germany is starting to build are in danger of being affected by the war. But since it is called a "planned withdrawal," there must be a certain limit. Where is this limit expected to be? We only need to open a map of the Ukrainian plains to understand it.</p>
<p>On the vast plains covered with ice and snow, artificial defenses hastily built cannot stop the overwhelming tide of enemy troops, especially in a battlefield with incomplete transportation facilities, where there is no way to use natural dangers as shields. The reason why the situation has evolved to this point is of course due to the negligence of the German forces who were complacent after their victories. But we cannot say that the German forces are panicked and on the verge of total collapse.</p>
<p>The German forces who retreated deeply into Ukraine, beyond the Caucasus and the Don River basin, are, if we feel they are planned, not using brilliant tactics, but rather the German defense forces' traditional spirit of prioritizing solidity in combat. Soldiers from Western Europe, accustomed to warm climates, feel paralyzed in sub-zero temperatures. But here, mechanized units of the enemy with winter gear appeared. In this situation, the German forces took a stubborn stance, refusing to leave and resolutely resisting, which led to the "Tragedy of Stalingrad," where the elite Southern Army of the German forces was completely annihilated. And the result may be fatal to the entire Eastern Battlefield. With the situation so serious, facing a powerful enemy and a future full of thorns, and from the perspective of human resources from the homeland, every soldier's life is worth cherishing, the German General Staff, under these circumstances, would rather endure temporary humiliation and seek future glory, and with a tragic and determined will, calmly assess the current situation amidst hatred and tears.</p>
<p>The German large army's retreat of over [omitted] kilometers, which set a new record, is completely contrary to Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics, but it is also a decisive action. A new aspect of the German army, unseen in the troops commanded by Hitler so far, can be glimpsed here. People are deeply puzzled that Hitler, who only advances and never retreats, now has this retreat order. But this question is completely wrong. The suffering endured on the Eastern Front for two years has fundamentally changed the original German combat strategy. This is a question of the people responsible for directing the operation, and also a question of weapons, and even more a question of tactical concepts.</p>
<p>The Red Army's Hunger Offensive</p>
<p>The German General Staff is now closely watching the natural environment of Great Russia and the enigmatic soldiers, and is starting to re-examine from a new perspective how to achieve victory in this struggle of the two nations' destinies. At the same time, the German-Soviet War has entered a new stage. If the German General Staff still adopts outdated operational concepts, then summer will be beneficial to us, just as winter is to the enemy, and we will only repeatedly replay the story of fighting back and forth. Moreover, the Red Army last summer and the German army this winter have both adopted retreat strategies, so they cannot thoroughly strike the enemy's combat power, ultimately leading to mutual losses. This is exactly what Britain wants. The German leaders understand this. What is noteworthy is that the Red Army's current winter offensive, which is called the "hunger offensive," has exhausted its last combat power. Then, in the upcoming offensive exchange period, what new tactics will the German forces, who are expected, adopt?</p>
<p>In the era of blitzkrieg, amateur tacticians who chattered endlessly in the rear have nothing to say before this major situation. Military experts are also silent. In this silence in the rear, there is a current of faith in the German defense forces. The general public's trust in the national defense forces, which they consider the strongest army in Europe, has never wavered. In the newspapers, the military reporters do have reflective discussions, believing that the underestimation of the Red Army has led to the serious consequences this time.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Destroy Combat Power</p>
<p>From the beginning, it was decided to take a defensive stance in winter, which some people thought was Liu's [unclear what this refers to]. But more people questioned why, if we had the mobility to retreat deeply to the rear by over [omitted] kilometers during the winter battle, we did not use this power to take a winter offensive instead. Here, a very clear fact emerged, that the depth of the winter battle has changed the people's belief in national defense. However, on such a vast battlefield as the Soviet Union, it is meaningless to focus on the struggle for one city or one town. If we do not reduce the enemy's military strength and weapons, we cannot consider that we have fulfilled the duty of war. Therefore, in this third offensive by the German forces, unlike last year's which aimed at territory, the German forces are pouring all their strength into destroying the enemy's combat power. From this point of view, this retreat is also shrinking the front line to the shortest distance, luring the enemy to the Ukrainian plains, which the German forces consider their most advantageous battlefield, and waiting for a season of sunshine and clear weather? To carry out a large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle like the blitzkrieg of the past, this explanation is used for self-consolation. Finally, Mr. Xu Huilin, the main writer of the Aisenstadt National Zeitung (transliteration), which is noted by the newspapers of Marshal Goering's system, stirs up his tragic and indignant writing style and describes the nature of the future new German offensive. Here is an introduction to its main points:</p>
<p>"The German offensive last summer and the Red Army's current winter offensive have given us major lessons. The Soviet Union did not win on the Eastern Front with excellent tactics and excellent weapons. This is not a question of quality but a question of quantity. A large amount of troops and a large amount of weapons are enough to sway the outcome of this war. The enemy treats us with violence, so we must retaliate in kind and treat them with violence as well. The goal of the national mobilization order is also here. In the future offensive, we have prepared troops that are better than those at Stalingrad and Storgerland [transliteration], manufactured more and better weapons than the enemy has, used violence to deal with violence, used quantity to deal with quantity, and used number to deal with number to resist the Soviet Union. This is our new answer!" (Xiang: Translated from the February 20th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

As for the fifth term of sugar rationing for households, which is the last term, the sugar merchant cooperative will continue to be responsible. The collection of the fifth term sugar house donation ticket has already started today (26th). Each ticket can purchase twelve catties of sugar, but it must be purchased at the newly revised price. As for the fourth term house donation ticket collected before the 25th, it can still be calculated at the original price.</p>
<p>Final Term: Sugar Rationing for Households (1) For Type A retail merchants in the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Zhabei area in Shanghai West, those in the International Settlement (including Hongkou) and the Zhabei and Shanghai West areas must use the Autumn-Li house donation ticket, while those in the French Concession must use the September-October house donation ticket. In accordance with the regulations, they must submit them to the cooperative for review and receive sugar on schedule. For those collecting house donation tickets on even days, the deadline is March 6th. For those collecting on odd days, the deadline is March 7th. Afterwards, the method of sugar rationing by population will be implemented, and the collection and sale will be stopped. The sugar sale dates are March 9th for those who sell on odd days and March 10th for those who sell on even days. Afterwards, purchase must be made with a new certificate and its assigned price.</p>
<p>Nanshi: 3 Catties of Sugar Per Household</p>
<p>(2) Type A retail merchants in the Nanshi area can temporarily purchase with the household registration certificate before the implementation of sugar rationing by population. Each household can buy [omitted] catties. The collection of certificates also starts today. The certificate will be taken to be exchanged at the store and a receipt given to the customer in return. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, send it to the store for audit and return it. Each food household can purchase sugar at the original store by relying on the receipt and collect the household registration certificate. Each store collects household registration certificates until March 9th and sells sugar until March 10th. The amount of sugar issued by each Type A retail merchant based on the household registration certificate is limited to the sugar ration for January. The amount of sugar rationed for February must be reserved for the needs of sugar rationing by population and must not be used. The same applies to the two concessions and the Zhabei area in Shanghai West.</p>
<p>Authorities Approve New Sugar Prices</p>
<p>The new sugar prices revised by the cooperative has been approved by the authorities and will also be implemented today (using Central Reserve Bank notes): Coarse granulated sugar is 6.67 yuan, snow-white sugar is 6.67 yuan, Dutch red sugar is 6.39 yuan, green sugar is 6.39 yuan, and rock sugar is 7.50 yuan, all calculated per catty (16 liang). However, the 2% retail donation is excluded. In the future, the price of sugar rationed by population will also follow the above.</p>
<p>Special Rationing Continues</p>
<p>As for the special rationing of sugar for self-use in various industries, the cooperative will continue to handle it. The special sugar for this month has already been submitted and will start to be distributed immediately. However, because there are tens of thousands of users and the end of the month is approaching, there may be delays until the notification slips are issued at the beginning of next month before completing the procedures for transferring certificates and picking up goods. All prices must be purchased according to the newly revised prices.</p>
<p>Sugar Rationing by Population: Regional Purchase</p>
<p>Regarding the city's Type A retail merchants, 58 sugar firms have been designated to manage, and they have been re-registered and merged to implement sugar rationing by population, which will be purchased regionally. A Shanghai reporter learned from the cooperative yesterday that the areas stipulated by the cooperative are: District 1, Public Rental Concession, west to Yu Qiaqing Road, east to the Bund, south to Avenue Edward VII, north to South Suzhou Road; District 2, Public Rental Concession, east to Yu Qiaqing Road, west to Jing'an Temple and Haig Road, south to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, north to Xin Zha Road; District 3, French Concession, west to Avenue Minteeni Yin Road, east to the Bund, south to Min Guo Road, north to Avenue Edward VII; District 4, French Concession, east to Avenue Minteeni Yin Road, west to Xujiahui, south to Xujiahui Road, north to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch; District 5, Hongkou, north of Suzhou Road, including Zhabei; District 6, West Caojiadu, Nanshi, and the inner city.</p>
<p>A List of Sugar Stores in the Central District for Retail Purchase</p>
<p>Finally, a reporter learned that 7 sugar retailers have been designated in District [omitted] of the Public Rental Concession. Their store numbers are as follows: Changchang at No. 15, Lane 414, Guangdong Road; Weisheng at No. 7, Lane 47, same road; Shenli at No. [omitted], Lane 190, Avenue Edward VII; Changyu at No. [omitted], Lane 424, Guangdong Road; Longchang at No. [omitted], Shandong Road. In the future, when collecting household sugar, it is necessary to check whether the number on the sugar purchase certificate matches the designated retail sugar store to avoid trekking [for nothing].</p>
<p>Certificates for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil to be Issued on the 1st</p>
<p>The Bureau of Industry and Commerce's unified management of materials originally scheduled the distribution of cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates by the district distribution offices and to taxpayers from the 1st. As a result of the printing not being completed, it was postponed to March 1st. Yesterday, the distribution certificate office at No. 2024 Mahuo Road posted a special announcement: "Taxpayers who should receive rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates today (26th) are requested to come to receive oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates before March 12th. Do not delay."</p>

At that time, the rice shops with registered numbers marked on the serial tickets will sell two sheng of white rice or brown rice and half a sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate serial ticket. The total price is 6.30 yuan. Each flour serial ticket is sold with 1 catty and 12 liang of flour and a price of 3.85 yuan. On March 10th, all rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will stop selling for one day.</p>

<p>Our newspaper's news, thousands of workers in the bookbinding industry in this city are demanding wage increases from the employers. According to our newspaper's inquiries from people in the industry, bookbinding workers are divided into folding, stitching, and typesetting workers. Most of them are contracted workers. The current wage is about one jiao per thousand copies. Skilled workers can earn ten to twelve yuan a day, but they must provide their own food and accommodation. At present, the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. It is really difficult to maintain the life of an individual or a family with this small amount. Therefore, the workers have jointly demanded that the employers increase wages by two times to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

<p>In view of France's resolute announcement of the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, the people rejoiced and were inspired. The China National Diplomacy Promotion Association specially sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Chu to congratulate him and to French Ambassador Cossé to thank him. The telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Minister Chu</p>
<p>Minister Chu, upon hearing the French government's statement on giving up the concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights, it is evident that your work under the leadership of Chairman Wang to strive for China's independence, freedom, and equality is a great achievement, celebrated by all the people.

We hereby send a telegram to pay our respects and hope to convey the Chinese people's thanks to your government. China National Diplomacy Promotion Association (with signature).</p>
<p>Increased Tax Revenue After Shanghai Concessions are Recovered</p>
<p>Since the French government announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions in various places, government officials and ordinary people in China have considered the wise measures of the French authorities to be a way of enhancing friendly relations between China and France. Especially after the authorities of friendly countries such as Japan and Italy announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China, this move by France has provided the government with great help in unifying the wartime economy. It also has great significance for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. According to reporters' inquiries from relevant tax authorities, after the French government has implemented the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, all obstacles to income tax, unified tax, special tax, and all business tax policies in the past can be completely eliminated. Tax revenue can be increased, and the rights and interests of industry and commerce can also be guaranteed by the government.</p>
<p>Foreigners File Applications to Request Naturalization in China</p>
<p>After the National Government joined the war, its international status suddenly improved. Friendly nation Japan first announced on January 9 the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions. Italy followed suit and took the same measures. Recently, France resolutely issued a statement on the 23rd, deciding to abolish extraterritorial rights in China and return concessions. From this, the privileges of foreigners in China have now been completely eliminated. It can be proven that China has gained freedom and equality internationally, and He Yun's [unclear what this refers to] approval as a just country in the world is even more obvious. Recently, the whole country has rejoiced as if it were [omitted], especially the people of this city. For example, a large number of unregistered foreigners in this city, in view of the National Government's rapid progress, have recently voluntarily submitted applications to the municipal government to forward to the Ministry of the Interior requesting naturalization in China. They have great hopes for the new China.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Public Rice Sales in the City Must First Pay <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the grain rationing program, all public rice sales offices in the city have first issued rice and then paid, which has directly and indirectly affected the grain administration greatly. In order to effectively rectify this, Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the bureau, specially ordered all public rice sales offices to pay half of the rice payment first and then issue rice, starting from today. The previous rice payments must be paid in full by the end of February. Starting in March, the entire rice payment must be paid first before the rice issuance procedure can be handled. Otherwise, severe punishments will be imposed. All district public rice sales offices, etc., have been ordered to comply with the order.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Sino-Japanese Cooperation Grows Closer <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>To prepare for development after the return of the concessions, there is a deep sense that a major transformation of Shanghai is necessary. For a century, the Chinese people have been constantly hoping for the restoration of national rights. Through Japan's mediation, this has been realized. All the nations of East Asia are unanimously focusing on the glorious and splendid face of the New China. Regarding this issue, Mr. Gihei Miyazaki, an auditor of the Shanghai Special Municipality, expressed the following sentiments:</p>
<p>"For example, if you take Japanese mountain cherry blossoms and transplant them to China, their color will change. Even with tea, even if it is the best Japanese tea leaves, when brewed with Chinese water, it doesn't seem fragrant. People generally think it is because of Shanghai's soil and water, but in fact, Chinese tea is very good, and the water is not bad either. It's because things in one place have the character of that place and should not be mixed up. This is the same for politics, economy, thought, culture, etc. If you bring Japanese politics, economy, thoughts, and culture wholesale to China to implement, it will not be successful." In the above passage, Mr. Miyazaki already had a profound, implicit meaning. He then added:</p>
<p>In the past, China had a so-called "contracting" system. By the late Qing Dynasty, local officials, such as county magistrates, would contract for all the administrative and tax revenues under their jurisdiction, using an annual salary of one hundred and twenty taels to support a large family and subordinates, even covering the expenses of prisons. Why was this done? Because the tax revenue was contracted to them. Even now, this trend is deeply rooted in social life. For example, doctors have a kind of "package medical care" system. Therefore, looking at Shanghai alone, it may seem like a modern national city on the surface, but in reality, China has not yet gone through the process of capitalism. Therefore, to implement economic controls, considerable political skill is required. Japan has a similar situation. If things are done too quickly, unreasonable things will happen.</p>
<p>At this historical turning point, Japan and China have no other way but to advance together towards the goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I heard someone say: China has often had wars or conflicts since ancient times, and I think so too. Now that China has restored its national rights and taken a step towards independence and autonomy, it can be said that this was achieved through conflict. However, this conflict is not against the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole, but an abstract conflict against unreasonable aspects.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he turned to the development embryo of the Shanghai Special Municipality, saying:</p>
<p>After the return of the International Settlement and the French Concession, the authority of the Shanghai Special Municipality will naturally be strengthened. Recently, China cannot do without the concessions because national capital is escaping into the concessions. This is the capital of the true Chinese nation. I think this is the embryo for building the New China. From now on, people of China and Japan must have a firm determination to act.</p>
<p>Mr. Miyazaki has lived in China for twenty-three years. His complexion is healthy and he doesn't look like he is already sixty-four years old. He finally said that the dawn of East Asia has already been revealed, and the East Asian nations have reached a period of creating a great new world.

<p>The English-language *The Times* reports that according to a certain Baojia (Neighborhood Association) personnel told reporters that the International Settlement Self-Defense Corps will hold a grand gathering at the Racecourse on March 12th (the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death). The program of this grand gathering will include camping and firefighting drills, as well as public health and road safety campaigns. Finally, there will be a parade, with the route being from Jing'an Temple Road through Nanjing Road to the Bund, and then from the Bund back to the Racecourse.</p>
<p>One Day in Advance - Duties Assigned</p>
<p>It is planned that on the afternoon of the 11th, nearly 500,000 members of the International Settlement Self-Defense Corps will be convened for a briefing, with each Baojia head informing their respective members of their obligations in the activities of these two days. Several members will be selected from the Baojia Corps to assume various responsibilities, with some being assigned to street corners to advise residents not to spit on the ground in order to maintain street cleanliness. Others will be sent to private residences in various neighborhoods to inform residents to be careful and to take care of children's health and cleanliness to prevent the invasion of diseases.</p>
<p>Evening - Camping Practice Held</p>
<p>On the evening of the same day, all members of the Self-Defense Corps will be ordered to return to the Racecourse to conduct camping practice and to leave their erected tents overnight. On the morning of March 12th, a memorial service will be held, recalling the circumstances of Sun Yat-sen's death at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital at 9:30 AM on March 12th, 1925. Next, a firefighting drill will be held, with most members of the Self-Defense Corps participating, while others will continue their health campaign, and another group will go to street corners and important locations to promote traffic rules that residents should pay attention to.</p>
<p>500,000 Self-Defense Corps Members Parade</p>
<p>Each street will have two or three members of the Self-Defense Corps assisting children and the elderly in crossing the road. Another obligation of these individuals is to stop those who violate traffic rules and explain the dangers they may encounter. On the afternoon of the 12th, except for those responsible for guarding duty, they will gather again at the Racecourse to conduct the largest parade in this city. Nearly 500,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps will wear armbands, proceeding from Jing'an Temple Road via Nanjing Road to the Bund, and finally returning to the Racecourse, before dispersing, it is said.</p>

<p>Each issue of this publication has a special feature column, which widely solicits opinions from all circles on current major issues, so that readers can understand the truth of the facts and know where they are heading. The solicitation of articles for the first and second issues has been favored by all circles and has already met with readers. The theme for the third issue is "Today's Cultural Circles in Shanghai." Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai, known as the cultural center, has seen all cultural work stagnate due to environmental and economic constraints. Not only are publications as rare as morning stars, but the various art sectors, such as film, drama, and broadcasting, also lack vitality and are insufficient to arouse national sentiment, relieve the public's intellectual famine, and supply the normal entertainment of the general public. Therefore, how to revitalize Shanghai's cultural movement to adapt to the current environment is a matter of great urgency. It is hoped that the cultural circles at home and abroad and all insightful readers will express their high opinions and send them to this publication for publication, so that the country can recognize the importance of this issue and make due efforts, which will not only be fortunate for this publication. Generous compensation will be provided for accepted manuscripts, ranging from fifty to eighty yuan per thousand words. Manuscripts should be submitted to the headquarters at 309 Hankou Road before March 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Discussion on Hanging the Household Registration Certificate in a Conspicuous Place in the French Concession <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Xiao</p>
<p>The household registration survey of residents in the French Concession by the police authorities has been completed, and identity residence permits have also been fully issued. Now, in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding in the Concession and to effectively maintain local public order, the police officers in each district are dispatched from time to time to check household registrations by Baojia. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that the head of each household must hang the household registration certificate in a conspicuous place for random inspection at any time; otherwise, penalties will be imposed. The intention is very good, but are there a few points that can be considered and improved by the authorities of the French Concession?</p>
<p>(1) Hanging the household registration certificate in a conspicuous place is quite suitable for those who live alone in a house; however, it is not suitable for those who live with several households in one house. However, in Shanghai, this kind of situation is unique. The most conspicuous place in a house is the living room, but in Shanghai, where every inch of land is precious, the living room is mostly rented out, and the head of the household does not necessarily live in the most conspicuous place in a house. There are also those who live in the so-called "third-story garret" and "kitchen shed." If the household registration certificate must be hung in a conspicuous place, a problem will arise. If the head of the household lives in the third-story garret or kitchen shed, then the household registration certificate should be hung in the tenant's house so that the police officer can see the household registration certificate during the random inspection. If the head of the household and the tenant have no opinions on weekdays, this will not be difficult to solve. If the head of the household and the tenant have had disputes, the other party will surely want to make things difficult as revenge, such as arbitrarily tampering with the certificate. If the authorities find out, they will definitely punish the head of the household. This is a difficult situation for the head of the household.</p>
<p>(2) It seems uneconomical and has drawbacks to have the Baojia head order the household registration certificate to be equipped with a frame. In today's Shanghai, where prices are soaring, the price of even a basic frame the size of a household registration certificate must be at least fifty yuan. If a person has two household registration certificates, they must be equipped with two frames, which will cost one hundred yuan. Therefore, please ask the authorities to slightly change the previous proposal and allow people to freely equip the certificates, or use other things as substitutes. They can use thick cardboard to make a backing and cover it with cellophane, so that the household registration certificate in the middle can be clearly seen and hung, which will reduce the cost considerably while achieving the same effect. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life live together, and petty criminals are rampant. If the household registration certificate is equipped with a frame and hung in a conspicuous place, it is inevitable that the object of theft will be heard every day, and the Baojia authorities and the head of the household will have to remake the household registration certificate, which will cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>(3) From the above two points, it seems that the household registration certificate does not need to be hung in a conspicuous place, nor does it need to be equipped with a frame. It should still be kept by the head of the household. If a police officer comes to check, the head of the household can be asked to take it out for inspection. If the household registration certificate is hung in a conspicuous place, the head of the household must be called first during the inspection. Therefore, there is no inconvenience in the transfer of procedures, and the above two kinds of difficulties can be solved.</p>

<p>The Tea Trade Association, in order to prevent the black market from arbitrarily raising tea prices, has specially assigned numbers to various teas and stipulated their maximum prices as follows (unit: one catty): No. 1, 80 yuan; No. 2, 64 yuan; No. 3, 48 yuan; No. 4, 32 yuan; No. 5, 24 yuan; No. 6, 16 yuan; No. 7, 12.8 yuan; No. 8, 8 yuan; No. 9, 6.4 yuan.</p>

<p>The various trade associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in suppressing commodity prices, have not only separately strengthened the organization of the Price Evaluation Committee, but have also successively drafted trade rules for industry sales, submitted them to the authorities for filing, and distributed them to all industry members for compliance. According to what the reporter has learned, the trade associations, in view of the fact that the reserves of materials in this city are still substantial, but there are attempts to smuggle and illegally hoard goods, which affects the supply of various materials, in order to assist the authorities in supervising the buying and selling of goods and strive to stabilize the market situation, have stipulated that if a member of the industry moves any goods from location A to location B, or from this city to another place, the holder of the goods must prepare a letter of justification and apply to the relevant trade association for a moving permit. However, it must be clearly stated: (1) the name of the goods; (2) the quantity; (3) the business name; (4) the location of the move; (5) the date of shipment; (6) the name of the manager; (7) the transportation route, etc. After obtaining the moving permit, the goods can be moved. However, the moving permit must be carried with you for inspection along the way; otherwise, it will be regarded as smuggling, and in addition to confiscating the goods, it will be dealt with according to the law, it is said.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6276, stating that from March 1st, shops selling flour, bread, macaroni, vermicelli, dried noodles, fresh noodles, cakes, fried dough sticks, plain steamed buns, coal and briquettes will all be exempt from the two-cent retail tax on goods.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Also Exempts</p>
<p>Dou Ruifu, Director of the Finance Department of the Shanghai French Municipal Council, issued an announcement yesterday, stating: In accordance with Consular Order No. 65 of February 22, 1943, the sale of cut noodles and other similar foods, oil cakes, steamed buns, etc., should be exempted from the two-cent retail tax from March 1st of this year. As for the sale of rice, flour, bread, cakes, etc., this bureau has exempted the tax for several months. Please inform all. This announcement.</p>
<p>Cut Noodle and Cooked Noodle Shops Request Increased Flour Allocation</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of flour allocation for noodle products, in addition to the allocation of flour for cut noodles and hot noodles, the Municipal Council's Rice and Flour Allocation Office has drafted joint allocation methods, delivering the flour allocation for the cooked noodle industry to the cut noodle industry, which will then produce fresh noodles and supply them to the cooked noodle industry, so as to save the livelihoods of workers in both industries and facilitate the purchase of food by ordinary people. However, the amount of flour allocated is too small, which is not enough for distribution to shops in the two industries, so it is still being requested to be improved and the allocation amount increased. The above methods have not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Stick Shops Allocated Flour - Although representatives Tang Miaoquan, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Guanshou, Zai Guisheng, etc. have been dispatched by the cake and steamed bun industry to petition the Municipal Council's Public Association Section and the Materials Control Department for allocation, there is still no relief method. However, the authorities are also aware that these shops have always been relied upon by coolies and the poor as an economical source of food. Once they are suspended, it will have a huge impact on the lives of low-level civilians. Therefore, they are already evaluating remedial measures.</p>
<h3 id="e37">More Than 6,000 Bags of Soybeans Transported to Shanghai - Distributed to Small Retailers Within Days - Membership Procedures Require Submission of Discussion Lists for Detailed Examination <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The military authorities have recently been concerned about the livelihood of the people in this city, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and monopolizing goods, so they have implemented an allocation system to seek social stability and peace. They are vigorously dredging the source of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains, so that they are continuously supplied. This time, more than 6,000 bags of soybeans and green beans transported from Xuzhou and Nanjing were still distributed by the Miscellaneous Grains Group Business Association. The group had already published an announcement in the newspaper, registering raw and cooked goods retailers to apply for allocation. However, the allocation has been delayed until now. In order to understand the truth about the delayed allocation, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Yang Heqing, the person in charge of the group, yesterday. According to him,</p>
<p>Reasons for Delay</p>
<p>The soybeans and green beans were sold as early as January 29th, and the group paid the military authorities on February 3rd. However, due to cumbersome procedures, the soybeans must be moved from the group to the military authorities to obtain a removal certificate, moved into the designated Yixing and Xinyuan Jutai warehouses, and then the group must submit the package feet of the distributed retailers to the authorities separately to obtain another wholesale moving certificate for each retailer before they can be allocated to the merchants. The reason for the delay in the delivery of goods this time is that 40% of the retailers have not yet paid. The deadline was limited to three days, but it was extended by two days at the request of the tofu industry, so it was delayed a few days more than in the past. Since the retailers have not paid their dues, the group naturally did not dare to submit the retail moving certificate to the authorities for approval and issuance. Otherwise, after the allocation, the money will be leaked, and although it can be forced to be returned, the group's asset turnover will be stagnant. Retailers who have paid have not received green beans for a long time, causing unnecessary panic. In fact, they can be allocated according to regulations within a few days. As for the total number of beans allocated this time, there are more than 6,000 bags, of which 250 bags are allocated to the Municipal Council Prison, and so on. The reporter also inquired about the procedures for joining the Miscellaneous Grains Association. According to him,</p>
<p>Membership Regulations</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the actual manager must have served in the Miscellaneous Grains industry for more than five years, and the recommender must also be a person of reputation in the same industry, in order to prevent people from outside the industry from borrowing the name of Miscellaneous Grains to engage in hoarding and speculation. Therefore, it is necessary to submit a discussion list for review, and the funds must also be thoroughly investigated. Only those who are deemed qualified can go through the membership procedures and be recognized as formal members, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Silver Money Industry From March 1st - Advance Business Hours - From 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM - Collection and Exchange Time Also Advanced <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional Joint Committee of Members of the Silver Money Industry in this city, in view of the fact that the season is pleasant and the days are getting longer, the business hours currently used by the industry are from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, and on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 12:00 noon, closed in the afternoon, and closed on Sundays for holidays. The exchange time for bills and the exchange time for the money industry market are all until 4:00 PM every day. According to the actual situation, this is not suitable. The committee decided at the meeting to officially implement the advance of the daily business hours of the member banks and money houses from March 1st of this year to 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, actually advancing one hour compared to before. The business hours are still six hours per day (internal office hours are also advanced, and may be extended if the work is not completed). Saturdays are also changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon, still open for half a day, and Sundays are closed for holidays. After recording the case, the Banking Industry and Money Industry Associations were notified to solicit opinions. The two associations convened the Executive Committee to discuss and approve the matter, and officially sent letters separately. The committee then decided to publish an announcement in various publications today, notifying all sectors that the business hours of the member banks and money houses of the silver money industry will be implemented on the next day (March 1st), implementing the new method of advancing one hour. The two industry associations also notified all member banks and money houses yesterday to check and handle the matter.</p>

<p>In order to suppress the price rise and stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities have imposed fines on the four silver buildings and famous yarn shops that traded at prices higher than the regulated price after Qiu Tianshi and others. Although the market prices in various industries have not been suppressed, the rising trend has been curbed. However, the black market transactions in the market recently still have latent unrest, so the hearts of the people have not yet been calmed. For example, the black market prices of red goods are still causing trouble in the hands of market traders. According to the Central News Agency reporter, who inquired from relevant parties, the Municipal Council has been paying close attention to the black market transactions of red goods for a long time, and has now determined a strict means of cracking down to eradicate the atmosphere of speculation. The trading of Chinese stocks on the market must be normal and beneficial for investment trading. It is heard that the Yongchang Stock Company and the China Stock Company can be ordered to resume business after the Municipal Council checks the business accounts and stipulates the methods, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Shen Bao Reader Old Knight Donates 20,000 Yuan <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>To Subsidize the Meal Expenses of Ten Poor Students - This Newspaper Will Distribute According to the Prescribed Method</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from "Old Knight," who stated that he had won 20,000 foreign yuan in horse racing and donated it to help students. The Knight participated in horse racing to promote sports, and transferred this large sum of money to cover the meal expenses of poor students, demonstrating a sense of justice and valuing wealth lightly, which is deeply admired. The Knight's history does not want to reveal his surname, which is especially admired. All the subsidy methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Old Knight's Letter</p>
<p>Old Knight's letter said, "I have never liked sports, but I am addicted to horse racing, which uses brainpower. I have always attached little importance to the gains and losses of gambling, because I rely on my profession to maintain my life. Recently, I won tens of thousands of yuan in cash in horse racing. I am already forty years old, but I am not old. However, it is human nature to be greedy for comfort and ease. Tens of thousands of yuan of unexpected wealth can vanish in an instant. Therefore, in addition to spending thousands of yuan on social gatherings and meals with friends, I have decided to donate the remaining 20,000 yuan to your newspaper to subsidize the annual meal expenses of ten students. I have drafted the methods and listed them below. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about education and promotes donations to poor students. I believe you will not hesitate to work hard to serve me and distribute according to law. I do not want my name to be known by your newspaper or the society, and I do not want the students who are assisted to know. I only hope that these students can strive to improve their studies, and I will be greatly gratified. If I can still afford to pay next year in addition to my personal and family expenses, I will determine the number of subsidies based on the amount of surplus, and select the students with better grades from these ten students to continue to provide subsidies to. Old Knight, February 25th,"</p>
<p>Distribution Method</p>
<p>Meal Subsidy Fund</p>
<p>Distribution Method</p>
<p>(1) 20,000 yuan is divided into ten shares, 2,000 yuan per share, specifically for subsidizing the annual meal expenses of ten students. After selecting the assisted students, the Shen Bao will negotiate with the school authorities of these students to stipulate the meal expenses that these students should pay in the school this year, 2,000 yuan each, paid in advance at one time, and the Shen Bao will directly send the money to each school for collection. (2) These ten recipients must be high school students who have already obtained the Shen Bao's scholarship and have outstanding achievements in subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics. (3) Among the above students, priority should be given to those whose fathers and brothers have been separated due to this incident and cannot obtain family support. This newspaper has decided on the following methods based on the points indicated in Old Knight's letter: (1) Re-select those with outstanding physics, chemistry, and mathematics test scores in the current third grade of high school. (2) Those who have lost their fathers and brothers due to this incident and cannot obtain family support must be certified by the school authorities and the person in charge of the business. If there are any cases of entrustment and concealment, the certifier shall be liable for full compensation. (3) The student's meal expenses will be paid to the school authorities by check with the payee indicated. If there is any surplus, it will be returned, and any deficiency will be borne by the student.</p>
<p>Class Association Surplus</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from all the fifth-year students of the Chinese-French Private Commercial Vocational School, saying, "We have seen the scholarship established by your newspaper, which benefits poor students, and we are very impressed. Because there is still a surplus after our class association was dissolved, we have raised 100 yuan and donated it to your newspaper to help students. The amount is small, but we hope that students from all schools will contribute, so that collecting fur into a robe will also make a small contribution."</p>
<p>Assistance Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Old Knight (delivered by Mr. Xie Hong) 20,000 yuan, Chen Bingyun and Tan Xingbo 5,530 yuan, Liang Ji and Wang Chenshi 200 yuan each, all the fifth-year students of the Chinese-French Commercial Vocational School 100 yuan, several high school students from Shanghai College (book sales price) 40 yuan, Zhu Jun 30 yuan, Zhang (returned surplus scholarship) 25 yuan, Pu Qiting (in memory of his ancestor Mr. Chunshan) 20 yuan, the first graduating class of China Girls' High School 10 yuan, Shi Douliang (missing item from the first grade of junior high school at Jiangxi Middle School) 5 yuan</p>

<p>Daily Necessities: Astounding Price Increases</p>
<p>The market for daily necessities continues to see new high prices emerge one after another. Observing recent trends, it seems the increases are boundless. For example, Phoenix brand matches are priced at 5,900 yuan, Beauty brand at 6,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 4,400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 3,100 yuan. Gu Ben soap is 1,050 yuan, Scissors soap is 1,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 990 yuan, and Bai Xiangmao is 960 yuan. Whiteley's candles are 750 yuan, Monk's Hat brand is 650 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 500 yuan. The ferocity of the price increases is astonishing.</p>
<p>Smooth Procurement of Central China Tobacco Leaves</p>
<p>The procurement of Central China tobacco leaves this period is excellent. It is estimated that the quantity purchased has reached 400 million taels. However, because the production of the Central China Tobacco Leaf Association is increasing daily, this amount is insufficient for application. Therefore, the relevant authorities are actively promoting further production. At the same time, they are also trying to obtain southern tobacco leaves from the Philippines and Shandong tobacco leaves. With such active efforts, it is believed that the supply of cigarette raw materials will be ample.</p>
<p>Public Debt: Difficult to Reverse Decline, Market Prices Falling Frequently</p>
<p>Following the previous day's decline, the public debt market continued to fall yesterday. Because both types Ding and Wu had already broken the 80 yuan mark the day before, yesterday both types Jia and Yi also broke the 80 yuan mark again. Confidence is waning, and the decline is difficult to reverse. The initial price of type Bing was 4.5 yuan, rising to 7 jiao, but later due to excessive selling, it plunged to a low price of 1.1 yuan, eventually recovering to around 1.6 or 1.7 yuan. The opening price of type Jia was already approaching the 80 yuan mark, at 9.5 yuan, falling to 9 yuan, and finally reaching 9.8 yuan. Type Yi was 9.5 yuan, falling to 7 yuan, and finally reaching 7.5 yuan. Type Ding was 7.5 yuan, falling to 6.2 yuan. Type Wu was 8.5 yuan, falling to 7 yuan, and finally reaching 7.2 yuan. The decline may not have reached its end.</p>
<p>Military Notes Slightly Lower, Joint Currency Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained at 1 jiao 8 fen, unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, military notes showed a slight decrease. There were no settlements, and supply turned abundant. Interbank trading retreated to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3.5 li. Small money shops and silver firms quoted prices of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen and a half, and 6 fen, with some variation. The Joint Reserve Bank notes continued to plummet. The exchange rate between Tianjin and Shanghai had briefly dropped to 2 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen in the past two days. Although it has recently recovered to 3 yuan 1 jiao, the difference is still huge. Therefore, yesterday's traders lowered prices from 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, doing business as low as 3 yuan 3 jiao 8 fen, with some buyers. Sales were made at 3 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen, another 1 jiao 7 fen lower.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Futures: Trading Higher and Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean cake futures trading was very active. Extramural speculators poured in, all viewing it as a paradise for competition. Prices were pushed higher and higher, consistently setting new records. The details are as follows: Shanghai factory soybean cake for February delivery of 30,000 pieces, priced at 128.5 yuan to 130 yuan. Also, for late February delivery of 10,000 pieces, priced at 126 yuan to 127.5 yuan. Sheng Ji and Li Zi soybean cake for early March delivery of 5,000 pieces, priced at 127 yuan to 128 yuan. Yuan Long soybean cake for six wagonloads, priced at 127 yuan to 127.5 yuan. Fei Zi soybean cake for two wagonloads, priced at 128 yuan, and another three wagonloads for delivery in one or two weeks, priced at 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Allotment Date Approaching, Anglo-American Cigarette Prices Declining</p>
<p>The cigarette market saw sluggish trading of Anglo-American goods. The approaching allotment date for the Central China Association caused nervousness, leading to price declines. Japanese and domestic cigarettes showed mixed performance, with both stable and weak trends. Large British brand cigarettes were priced at 12,500 yuan, Old Knife brand at 10,550 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 8,200 yuan, Fairy brand at 8,300 yuan, and Wu Hua brand at 6,900 yuan, a decrease of 200 to 300 yuan compared to yesterday. Japanese cigarettes opened at 3,400 yuan for Golden Gun brand, 4,200 yuan for Golden Mansion. Guide brand was 3,400 yuan, Red Rose 2,800 yuan, Quan Lu brand 4,000 yuan, and 20-stick packs at 3,500 yuan. Domestic cigarettes were priced at 8,000 yuan for Pyramid, 7,000 yuan for Beauty brand, 4,500 yuan for Golden Rat brand, and 4,800 yuan for Platinum Dragon, with relatively few transactions.</p>
<p>Hainan Dried Longan: Another 500-600 Pieces Arrive</p>
<p>Although the previously arrived Hainan dried longan has been held for a long time without being sold, yesterday's news from dealers indicates that another 500-600 pieces have newly arrived, so the market situation is slightly stabilized. Trading houses have already begun preliminary price negotiations. If the price difference is not too large, there should be a formal market in the coming days.</p>
<p>Mosquito Coil Raw Materials Scarce, Production Reduced, Sales Price High</p>
<p>Due to the exhaustion of raw materials in the producing areas, the production of mosquito coils, which are needed during the summer, has decreased. Therefore, the price of Sanxing brand mosquito coils from the Chemical Society is 29 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen 5 li per dozen, ex-warehouse price. The first batch of goods has been sold out, and a second batch is being requested.</p>
<p>The rising trend in the market for Western learning goods has turned stable. Generally, hoarders consider the prices too high, and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages for those entering the market. Therefore, recently, the opening prices have gradually fallen. Headache powder is priced at 45 yuan, Tiger Balm at 57 yuan, Bagua Dan at 45 yuan, Partridge Greens at 85 yuan, and Lung Fu Jen Tan at 45 yuan.</p>

<p>All Aspects of Allied Nations Returning and Transferring Military-Managed Factories and Enemy Property, Yuan Gui</p>
<p>(3) The Transfer Section:</p>
<p>On February 8th of this year, the Allied authorities decided to transfer a portion of the enemy property seized in China at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, totaling 103 items, to the National Government for management. Among these, 788 items are in North China (68 belonging to industry and 720 to culture); 233 items are in Central China (109 belonging to industry and 124 to culture). The total current value is estimated to be above 500 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>The 109 enemy properties in Central China belonging to industry that are being transferred are listed below, categorized by number:</p>
<p>As for cultural properties, they include schools, hospitals, churches, theaters, clubs, etc.</p>
<p>The authorities' announced list of important industrial names is excerpted below for a general view:</p>
<p>Those belonging to Central China: Roosevelt and Huashun wharves, Wuzhou Pharmacy, China-America Evening News, Damer Evening News radio stations, Jardine Matheson, China Chemical Industry Society, Ewo Silk Factory, Brunner Mond &amp; Co., Sullivan factories, Shanghai Machine Ice Factory, American Light Match Company, Shenxin factories, Tongyi Textile Factory, Shanghai Huiluo Company, Welfare Company, American Enterprise Company, British Egg Company, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun department stores, Ginling and St. John's Universities, and British-American hotels, etc.</p>
<p>Those belonging to North China: Taku Wharf, Jardine Matheson, Sino-American Cold Storage Company, and Yenching University, etc.</p>
<p>To take over the above enemy property, the National Government's Supreme National Defense Council has ordered the establishment of the "Enemy Property Management Committee," with Finance Minister Zhou Fohai appointed as chairman.</p>
<p>(4) Some Issues Regarding Return and Transfer:</p>
<p>First, based on the above-mentioned categories of returned and transferred industries and the number of each category, light industry (especially the textile industry) accounts for the vast majority. Heavy industries such as the steel and shipbuilding industries are few in number, and their names have not been publicly announced. This shows that the Allied nations' mission in industrial production for our country is to preserve the production of light industry. Recently, Allied authorities have repeatedly stated that they will concentrate the production of heavy industry in their own country (Japan) and plan to move domestic light industry to Central China for production, further proving the validity of this statement.</p>
<p>Secondly, enemy properties being transferred, such as the China Chemical Industry Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Shenxin factories, Tongyi Yarn Factory, China-America Evening News, Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun department stores, were originally Chinese industries that used British and American names after the "August 13th" incident. Therefore, the transfer can also be considered a part of the return.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Shenxin factories being transferred had already been officially returned as military-managed factories on May 22nd, 1942. This is probably because factories had used American names in the past.</p>
<p>(5) Post-Return and Post-Transfer Industrial Dynamics and Prospects:</p>
<p>The operation of the returned factories mostly adopts a Sino-Japanese joint venture approach. For example, after the return of Hengfeng Yarn Factory, negotiations were held with the original trustee, Dai Nippon Spinning, and it was decided to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture with a capital of 5 million Japanese yen, with each side contributing half. Similarly, after the return of Zhanghua Wool Company, in order to resume business, it cooperated with the Japanese-owned Shanghai Textile Company to change it to Shanghai Zhanghua Wool Company with a capital of 2 million yuan, with each party contributing half.</p>
<p>As for the various enemy properties (factories) being transferred, no action has yet been taken. However, according to speculation, the Enemy Property Management Committee will likely transfer them to Chinese merchants for operation. In terms of raw materials, capital, and technology, Allied assistance will certainly be indispensable.</p>
<p>It is impossible to operate the returned and transferred factories in the same liberal manner as in the past. This view is also harmful to our country's current wartime economic system. At this critical juncture in the Greater East Asia War, individual interests must be placed in a secondary position. Everything is for the sake of winning the war, although we firmly believe that the Allied nations and the National Government have not hindered the legitimate profits of private enterprises.</p>
<p>In fact, under a strict wartime system, all capital, raw materials, production, distribution, transportation, etc., are subject to strict control. Individual liberal operational methods are certainly impossible. Therefore, we can confidently say that the current Chinese economic community must share weal and woe, help each other, and jointly strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War with the Allied nations!

<p>The Miserable Economic Life of Ordinary People in Soviet Russia: Suffering in Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 25th dispatch—According to neutral diplomats recently arrived from Moscow, the economic life of the Soviet Russian people is extremely miserable. There are only two major hotels in Moscow, exclusively for high-ranking government officials, diplomats, and journalists. Ordinary people's housing is extremely desolate. Government control agencies do not, in fact, allocate fuel, and residents have to dismantle their own furniture to use as fuel. Since the beginning of winter, the trees in the parks have been completely cut down, but the timber is entirely used to heat the homes of high-ranking Soviet government officials. The problem of bread for ordinary people is particularly serious, and prices are even more appalling. Each kilogram of bread costs approximately the wages accumulated by an average worker for two weeks. Trams, buses, and underground trains in the city can only be used with special permission, as all means of transportation are uniformly reserved for Soviet military and political leaders, and ordinary people are not allowed to use them. The diplomat also said that at present, more than 40 million Soviet women have been conscripted to work in industry and agriculture. Most of these women have no socks to wear and have to work barefoot. In short, the misery of the economic life of the Soviet Russian people is beyond description.</p>

<p>Free Talk: New Year Atmosphere? Zhengzhi</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year passed two months ago; the Lunar New Year passed one month ago. However, as we pass by on the road, we see that most shops open late, at 10 AM, and close early, at 3 or 4 PM. It feels like the New Year atmosphere is especially long this year compared to previous years.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, most shops are unwilling for customers to exchange banknotes for goods. Merchants are treating every item as a "rare commodity to hoard." To put it more plainly, some shops wish they could close their doors completely and become hoarders.</p>
<p>Hoarding is prohibited by law, so some merchants have a sudden inspiration: they dare not truly "close their doors," and instead "close early." Closing early is between "closing" and "opening": between "selling" and "not selling." The longer the closing early time, the more goods the old merchant can keep, and the thicker the profit becomes; but the general public suffers!</p>
<p>The New Year has long passed. This New Year atmosphere is still not over. I ask, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p>Scientific Essay: Skin and Skin Diseases, Hong Xin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>It would be a big mistake to think of the skin as a fixed garment of the human body. In the human body, whether it is the ceaseless flow of blood or the rock-solid skeleton, all are alive and changing every minute. The skin, the vanguard of the human body, is constantly working. It can be called a specialized organ, with its own blood vessels and nerves, equipped with various glands, and muscles capable of contracting and expanding. The long hair protecting the head and the armpit hair reducing friction are its transformations. The smooth and delicate nails are transformed for delicate movements. If humans still needed to snatch food like beasts, it would still turn into sharp claws. The keratinous weapons of beasts and the magnificent shells of insects that we marvel at are merely showing one aspect of the transformation ability of this ordinary garment.</p>
<p>Upon careful study, the skin can be divided into at least two layers: the epidermis on the outside, the first line of defense. The division of human skin color exists in the pigment within the basal cells of the epidermis. It serves as a weapon for defending against light. Therefore, the more intense the light, the more pigment there will naturally be. White people lack pigment excessively. The basal cells of the epidermis divide and reproduce countless times every day. The new cells are powerful guards from the day they are born. When their bodies are dry, they still use their bodies, containing keratin, to adhere to the outer layer of the epidermis, preventing the entry of bacteria. Its acidity is sufficient to extinguish several kinds of microorganisms with excess. Its oiliness prevents moisture and chemical baths from penetrating. The old cells have completed their last step, falling off, leaving the body with dirt, and the new cells leap up, never stopping. Behind the rich epidermis is the dermis, which is equipped with blood vessels, nerves, muscles, fat, and elastic tissue. It is the supplier of nutrition. The work of the skin is not limited to defense. When the body is too hot, it dilates the blood vessels, and most of the blood rushes to the surface to discharge its heat, so that the body temperature returns to normal. When it is attacked by cold, the blood vessels constrict to prevent the blood from being exposed and consuming heat. The sweat glands also stop their activity, and the muscles carefully tighten the skin to reduce the exposed area to the maximum extent. This is proof that it can regulate body temperature. It can breathe, absorb food, and secrete sebum. It has pigment to resist the damage of ultraviolet light to the internal organs, but it has not forgotten to use the principle of support, relying on ultraviolet light to create Vitamin D. Changes in the body are partly or entirely reflected on the skin. Therefore, sensitive medical scholars have developed a new branch of knowledge based on it, specializing in the study of changes in the skin in physiological and pathological states.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The skin is constantly fighting against external invasions and should be loved and respected. Some people seem to have no patience for itching, and arbitrarily use long and hard fingernails to scratch wildly, causing the skin to become red and swollen, even torn, flowing with yellow-colored tears, telling them that it has been injured. But often it does not receive pity, and the same scratching comes again, followed by applying a layer of "× Gold Oil," "× Fu Cream," or using "× Teling" or "A × Lin" to kill the itch. This is satisfying, the work is completed. Whether the source of the disease has been removed and whether one's bad habits have been corrected are things that never cross their mind. The skin cannot withstand insults. If you insult it, it will never run away according to your wishes. It is angry, swollen, feverish, or painfully flowing with yellow water. Do you believe in those effective remedies? Are they really applicable to any disease and under any conditions? If so, then it is just the "metaphysical" "idea" that is playing tricks on you. Because even the use of special drugs has its strict conditions. There are many diseases of the skin, but if we discipline our hands well and do not lightly use over-the-counter drugs, many diseases may heal themselves. If you want to be clean, then washing with clean water at all times is enough. Never use medicinal water to "eliminate" "toxins" on the skin. If you want the skin to be more beautiful, then you should start with the health of the entire body, because the color and elasticity of the skin are determined by the pigment in the skin, the strength of the blood, the storage of subcutaneous fat, and many other factors.</p>
<p>(Scholarship Reward for Assistance) Sixth Place in January Essay Contest: My Life—An Apprentice, Fang Chuan</p>
<p>It was probably last October! I obeyed my parents' orders, left school life, and entered an old-fashioned "trade" to learn a trade, and I became an apprentice to a "professional master." From that time on, I was called an apprentice. Apprentices are considered somewhat inferior—everyone seems to have this idea in mind. Therefore, the title "apprentice" has always been despised.</p>
<p>My mother repeatedly warned me and told me: learning a trade is much harder than studying, but endure it! After three years of apprenticeship, there will be a way out. My mother's words are never wrong, I believe. So, before I entered the shop, I had already prepared myself for hardship, as if I were a prisoner sentenced to death, feeling the same way before going to the execution ground.</p>
<p>During the first few days of my entry into the shop, apart from my master giving a few instructions, the other gentlemen naturally had nothing to say. Several senior apprentices also thought it necessary to observe the new junior apprentice. So, whenever I did something, they were always watching secretly, without saying whether it was good or bad, as if they were monitoring, which would make you feel unnatural. Later, as time went on, we got to know each other a little, so they began to pass down the work one by one (saying pass down is really accurate, whenever a new apprentice comes in, the one above passes on all the work to him, generation after generation is like this) sweeping the floor, wiping the counter, brewing tea, measuring... there are indeed many things. From morning to night, doing it alone, there will never be a free moment for you to practice writing or learn arithmetic, even though the master stipulates that you must practice writing and learn arithmetic every day.</p>
<p>Most masters are not easy to serve. Ours, of course, is no exception. One moment he wants this, the next moment he wants that, and he will readily accuse you of being "stupid" or "dull," which makes you feel a little unconvinced. But do you dare to resist? Otherwise, he will tell you to "find another job" and go home with your bedding. Several senior apprentices are even more terrifying, with cold faces, staring at you all day long. They tell you to do things, send you to buy things, whether it is official business or private business, you have to obey them. Otherwise, you will be out of luck. Because they basically regard the new junior apprentice as a "vent." Abusive terms like "pig" and "little devil" can often be heard from their mouths. Sometimes, suffering undeserved injustice, I really want to cry bitterly in secret, but what's the use? It only increases the material for their ridicule! Tears fall from the corners of my eyes, and I immediately wipe them away with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>This is probably because I have been exposed to too much cold and cold water! As soon as the weather gets cold, frostbite appears on my hands and feet, making it so painful and itchy that I simply cannot work. But can I not work because of this? There is no such easy thing. I still work as usual, and still run errands as usual. Several gentlemen cannot avoid buying snacks twice a day—morning and dusk—and it is invariably your job. No matter how heavy the snow is falling or how strong the wind is blowing today, you cannot disobey because of this. The snowflakes and gusts of northwest wind attack the festering frostbite, causing a vague pain, a truly indescribable suffering. Struggle! Alas! Struggle for life!</p>
<p>If there are many customers today, not being able to eat enough becomes the most worrying thing. In a very short time, I add rice seven or eight times, and wash my face three or four times. No matter how fast you eat, you can't eat two bowls. A young man has a good appetite, how can it be enough? Running errands on an empty stomach is really killing. Buy snacks? To be honest, the meager income is not enough for haircuts and laundry. Where does the money come from?</p>
<p>My master's wife lives upstairs from us, so there are even more things to do. Ordering me to do this and that is not to mention, there is endless work to do all day long. If I do something wrong, I cannot avoid a scolding, a vicious scolding that will make me shed tears. "Damn it, being an apprentice is simply being a waiter." In unbearable circumstances, such complaints will be made. I really don't believe in the meaning of being an apprentice. What exactly have I learned? Is it intentional to crush the hearts of young people? Or is it to cultivate promising young people and foster a spirit of hard work and endurance? Otherwise, why be an apprentice?</p>
<p>Recently, there have been even more things to do. Grinding sugar and grinding oil inevitably involve apprentices. The gentlemen only know how to sit with their legs crossed, speaking in their local dialect, and a single command will keep you busy for half a day. They only know that a single instruction will have an effect, and they don't think at all about whether "grinding" is an easy thing. So, when I can't buy it back, a scolding is unavoidable. What can you do?</p>
<p>In short, my apprenticeship life cannot escape a "bitter"—endless bitterness. But I believe my mother's words: endure it! After three years of apprenticeship, there will be a way out. So I endure—waiting for the way out in the future.</p>
<p>The Secret of Air, Xi Wen</p>
<p>In front of the Madeleine Church in Paris, which commemorates Napoleon, there is a towering bronze statue. This is the builder of modern chemistry—Lavoisier. The inscription above reads:</p>
<p>He was the first to launch an attack on nature and established great achievements. In 1774, after twelve days and twelve nights of continuous effort, he finally officially broke the secret of air. He revealed the details of the combustion of matter in air and many changes, eliminated many superstitions, and opened the door to research for later chemists.</p>
<p>"What is air?" In the past, people's answer was: "Air is air." Lavoisier decided to interrogate air to see what secrets this shadowless monster still held.</p>
<p>His method of interrogating the air was very impolite. First, he put some mercury in a curved-necked glass bottle, and then extended the long neck of the bottle into a glass bell jar inverted in a mercury trough. Thus, the air was trapped inside the curved-necked glass bottle and the bell jar, and the outside air could not come to disturb and rescue it.</p>
<p>After setting it up, he put the curved-necked glass bottle on the stove and used fire torture to interrogate it. If we magnified these trapped air molecules by one hundred million times, we would see how pathetic natural substances are as conquered beings in our hands! If we magnified the air molecules by one hundred million times, they would probably be like a small flea (the diameter of a molecule is one hundred millionth of a centimeter). Inside this glass bottle and jar, there would be tens of thousands of lively fleas (molecules are constantly flying and moving in the air) being imprisoned, and the fire below is forcing them to run and jump very frantically, until they spit out their secrets!</p>
<p>In this way, after twelve days and nights of fire torture, Lavoisier finally obtained the secret of air. On one hand, a layer of red powder appeared on the mercury in the curved-necked glass bottle, and the mercury rose by about one-fifth in the glass bell jar in the mercury trough, indicating that one-fifth of the air inside had been consumed.</p>
<p>Lavoisier first tried to see if the remaining gas in the bell jar was different from air. He struck a match, which burned very well in the air, but strangely! When this match was placed in the bell jar, it immediately went out. This was no longer air—or rather, the gas in the air that makes things burn had disappeared.</p>
<p>Obviously, the gas in the air that makes things burn had hidden in the red powder. So, he took out these red powders and burned them with high heat. Sure enough, gas was driven out, and the red powder gradually turned into mercury. He collected these gases and tried them with a lit match. As soon as he put them in, they emitted a dazzling light, even blowing the match out. Only a little spark remained, and it could burst into flames again with a "poof."</p>
<p>What a wonderful discovery!</p>
<p>The monster air that surrounds us, like a vast ocean surrounding the earth, without a shadow, was finally conquered by us. It obediently revealed its original form in front of us. We call the part of air that does not help things burn as [Nitrogen], and the part that helps things burn as [Oxygen]. (Scholarship for Poverty Relief)</p>

<p>At the front door, he shook hands.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my boy."</p>
<p>The answer came, in a high-pitched voice: "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..."</p>
<p>Mr. Chips sat down by the fire again, his ears still ringing with those words. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..." An old prank, getting new students to think his name really was Chips; the joke had almost become a tradition. He didn't mind. "Goodbye, Mr. Chips..." He remembered, on the night before he was married, Kathie had used those words, gently mocking his solemn attitude at the time. He thought: No one would say I was solemn now, that was certain...</p>
<p>Suddenly, tears began to roll down his cheeks—a weakness of old age; maybe it was foolish, but he couldn't help it. He felt very tired; talking to Linford seemed to have taken a lot out of him. But he was glad he'd met Linford. Good boy. He'd do well.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell for evening prayers, trembling, muffled, came through the fog-laden air. Mr. Chips looked at the window; outside, the gray was turning to dusk; it was time to light the lamps. But just as he was about to move, he felt he couldn't; he was too tired; but, anyway, it didn't matter. He leaned back in the chair. Not a bad little sprat—eh,—that's right. Thinking of Linford was amusing. Dealing with those who sent him was a good idea. Goodbye, Mr. Chips... Though it was strange, he would have to say it like that...</p>
<p>(18)</p>
<p>He seemed to have dozed off a bit, and when he woke up, he saw he was already undressed; Mr. Mulford was there, leaning over him, smiling. "Well, you old codger—feeling better now? You really gave us a fright—"</p>
<p>Mr. Chips murmured something, stopped, and said in a voice so faint that it surprised him, "Why—um—what—what happened?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing but you just fainted. Mrs. Wickett came in and saw you—thank goodness she did. You're all right now, aren't you? Relax. Go to sleep again if you feel like it." (48)</p>

<p>(1) My name is Feng Qixi, I am seventeen years old. I was a sophomore at Siyuan Middle School. Because the Great East Asia War broke out the year before last, foreign ships were greatly reduced, and the customs brokerage firm where my father worked was shut down. My father lost his job, and I dropped out of school. It has been a year and a half since then. At a time when prices are soaring, it is difficult for a family of four to make ends meet. My parents have entrusted relatives and friends to find a job for me, but there has been no progress so far. Now my younger brother and I take care of our daily lives, such as cooking. Because my father is old and weak, and my mother has suffered from severe asthma for fifteen years. Occasionally inhaling gas will trigger asthma. I take care of household chores in the morning, read medicine at the library in the afternoon, and learn English typing after dinner. I am most interested in history, geography, and news. I can read the national, Shanghai, and Cantonese dialects, and I am very willing to take on a librarian-like job. Address: Lane 124, No. 13, Baik Road.</p>

<p>The first round of the Western Union Football Group A saw a match between Liaison and the Righteous Navy. They are scheduled to meet again today at 3:45 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The referee is Trosé, and the linesmen are Hales and Zhang Zhiben. In the first round, the two teams fought to a 2-2 draw. This time, they will meet again, and both sides will undoubtedly give their all to determine the winner. Liaison suffered a defeat in the Steele Cup and has been unsuccessful in the Group A league. For today's match, they have reorganized their team, and Wu Qixiang is determined to rise again and contribute. The Righteous Navy's lineup is also exceptionally complete, and their hopes of winning this match are very high. If they win again today, they can secure Jingzhou. However, judging from their performance against Donghua last week, the Righteous Navy's skills have clearly declined. Therefore, the outcome of the battle with Liaison is uncertain, and a fierce fight is inevitable. Tickets are five yuan and ten yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Special Compilation of Various Regions in Southeast Asia (4): A Comprehensive Discussion of Malaya (4) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Voters</p>
<p>In order to maintain this "Throne of Tin," in 1930, Britain took advantage of the global economic panic to propose an international agreement to restrict production. Due to the large number of tin-producing units in the British system, it completely controlled the decision-making power in the international committee. At the same time, it deliberately kept Australia, Burma, and South Africa from participating in the international alliance, forming an outer line. It manipulated the agreement committee from both inside and outside, completely deciding the production and export ratios of various countries according to its own interests, in order to dominate the world's tin mining industry.</p>
<p>Through the two major commodities of rubber and tin, Britain subordinated the Southeast Asian countries to Malaya. Furthermore, with Singapore's superior geographical conditions, all products from Southeast Asia had to be exported through Singapore, thus further consolidating Britain's dominance over the entire Southeast Asia. Looking at Malaya's trade situation, although the Malay Peninsula is a raw material country, 3% of its imports are raw materials. Among its import partners, Dutch Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, India, and other raw material countries account for the absolute majority.</p>
<p>Therefore, Malaya became Britain's financial factory and America's lifeline during wartime. The United States, aware of this, signed a cotton-rubber exchange agreement with Britain and established rubber storage companies, metal storage companies, etc., engaging in purchases at high prices and strengthening restrictions on civilian use in preparation for military needs. According to recent information, domestic rubber reserves amount to 615,000 metric tons (of which 215,000 metric tons are owned by the government), but based on the past average consumption of approximately 75,000 metric tons per month, this is only sufficient for eight months. The same is true for tin. The so-called super-large military budget of 59 billion US dollars in 1942 ultimately proved useless, and now it can only rely on tin from Bolivia and rubber from the Amazon. However, there are major issues in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the planting of oak trees in Liberia and the discovery of rubber forests in the Orinoco River in the mountains of Venezuela were also widely publicized at one time, but the former is insufficient for a single autumn harvest for Firestone, and the latter is difficult to extract and transport due to its location in deep mountains. Therefore, the loss of Malaya is a great blow to Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Let's look at the supply and demand of important raw materials in the United States:</p>
<p>(1937-39 average, in metric tons)</p>
<p>The sources of raw materials needed by the United States are as follows:</p>
<p>Tin: 74% from Malaya, 6% from Dutch Indonesia.</p>
<p>Raw rubber: 59% from Malaya, 17% from Dutch Indonesia, 6% from Ceylon, 5% from Vietnam.</p>
<p>Britain's self-sufficiency level: rubber from Malaya accounts for 66%, tin from Malaya accounts for 8%, and from West Africa accounts for 21%.</p>
<p>(7) The Loss of Democratic Countries After the Fall of Malaya</p>
<p>The losses to Britain and the United States after the fall of Malaya are already significant, considering only the two items of rubber and tin mentioned above. Let's examine it further. First, Malaya's rubber and tin are proudly ranked as the world's number one. In peacetime, they are important industrial raw materials. The United States and Britain are both highly industrialized countries, and these two raw materials are indispensable for the British automobile industry, aviation industry, and canning industry. However, their significance as military resources is even greater. These two major resources were lost along with the change of flag in Malaya during the Greater East Asia War! This cannot be said to be the most significant blow to the post-war armament plans of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Second, the loss of Singapore, an important political, economic, and military base for controlling the oceans of East Asia, may be even more significant than the loss of the two major resources of rubber and tin! Because from then on, Britain and the United States lost their central base for dominating the southwestern Pacific. In economic terms, in addition to the aforementioned rubber and tin, important and large quantities of resources such as oil from Dutch Indonesia and wool from Australia were cut off from Britain and the United States! At the same time, the Southeast Asian market, which had long been drained of its sweetness through the harsh exploitation of the colonies, was also lost. This is naturally an irremediable loss for the economies of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The rubber production of the Malay Peninsula accounts for 40% of the world's total, and tin accounts for 35%, most of which is exported. Singapore is the center for controlling the Southeast Asian economic sphere. Rubber and tin from Dutch Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are also concentrated in Singapore. Its actual export volume exceeds the production volume of Malaya. The largest customer for exports is the United States. According to 1939 statistics, 60% of the rubber and 74% of the tin consumed by the United States came from Singapore. As a major American newspaper stated, "Malaya is the lifeline of Detroit and Akron." This is because Detroit is the location of the famous Ford Motor Company, and Akron is the location of the largest factory of the Goodyear Tire Company, representing the largest consumption centers for rubber and tin during peacetime. Moreover, in recent years, these two places have become the center of the military industry, and the consumption of rubber and tin has naturally increased even more. Therefore, the cutoff of these two major material supplies from Malaya will have a negative impact on the American military and other democratic countries that rely on American supplies. Not only that, Americans consume a large amount of canned food, with half of their daily food being canned, consuming 13 billion cans a year. Therefore, the loss of Malaya not only saddens Detroit and Akron, but also threatens the lives of all Americans.</p>
<p>The second largest customer for Malayan exports is Britain itself. However, in Britain, it is not so much the actual rubber and tin as it is the American funds exchanged for these materials that are more important. Looking at Malaya's trade in 1940, exports to the United States amounted to 591.5 million Straits dollars, and imports from the United States amounted to 38 million Straits dollars, resulting in a surplus of 553.3 million Straits dollars, equivalent to 265 million US dollars. This huge amount of US dollar funds flowed entirely into the British government's treasury due to strict foreign exchange controls. It was also thanks to this fund that Britain was able to purchase airplanes and cannons from the United States, which were sent to Britain under the escort system, becoming the largest source of weapons in Britain's war against Germany and Japan. No wonder the British refer to Malaya as a treasury and a financial factory. However, the British imperialists in the past only knew how to be selfish and strengthen their exploitation of Malaya, disregarding the welfare of the residents. As a result, all the airplanes and cannons became bait for the Japanese army, and the public anger caused by the past exploitation policy finally led the British rulers to reap their own reward—the British forces were driven out of Malaya. However, the result is not only the loss of Malaya, but also an irreparable and incurable loss!</p>
<p>The activities of overseas Chinese in Malaya should be traced back to the late Song Dynasty at the latest, which was in the early 13th century AD, hundreds of years before the colonial scramble by Westerners! The overseas Chinese have been operating in Malaya for more than 700 years, and regardless of the nominal status, Malaya has indeed become their homeland! Whether in the economic or other aspects, they have a solid foundation. According to a 1939 survey, the overseas Chinese population was over 3.3 million, accounting for 42% of the total population of Malaya. Overseas Chinese are serving in all professional sectors, with the strongest presence in the commercial sector. Of the 990 million yuan invested by overseas Chinese, commercial investment accounts for 60%, and rubber and tin investment accounts for 30%. Although the investment of overseas Chinese capital in tin mining is relatively small, it accounts for 50% of the total investment in Malayan tin mines, accounting for 18% of the world's tin production under the control of overseas Chinese! The same is true for rubber. The processing and handling of rubber are all managed by overseas Chinese, among which the Fujianese have a dominant position. We should also know that the largest and most modern rubber product factory in Malaya is none other than Tan Kah Kee's Tan Kah Kee Rubber Company, owned by the Fujianese Tan Kah Kee.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese have an unshakable influence in the Malayan economic world. The strained finances of Chongqing rely entirely on the support of overseas Chinese to avoid collapse. After the Greater East Asia War, the support was cut off, and it is not difficult to imagine the significant impact on the Chongqing government.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Fundamental Solution to the Low Price Policy <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Ask factory owners if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if prices are low, raw materials are cheap, and other wages and factory expenses are reduced accordingly. With reduced costs, manufactured goods will be easier to sell, and with faster capital turnover, profits will be abundant. Which factory owner would not welcome a low price policy? Ask shop owners if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if prices are low, it is easier to purchase goods, which will make the wholesale price lower than the retail price, unlike the current situation where the wholesale price is higher than the retail price. In this case, although the numbers on the books will gradually decrease, the inventory in the store will gradually increase. In terms of actual assets, there will inevitably be an increase rather than a decrease. Which shop owner would not welcome a low price policy? Ask speculators if they welcome the low price policy. They say that if Shanghai's speculative market is allowed to return to its former state, 300 yuan can be used to trade 1,000 Japanese yen, two or three thousand yuan can be used to trade ten bales of cotton yarn, and two or three hundred yuan can buy one tael of gold. If everyone knows that prices will inevitably decline, there will be more short sellers, and the more they sell short, the more profitable they will feel. If they can make profits in the same way, why do they need to go long to raise the living standards of the masses? Therefore, speculators also welcome low prices. However, the reason why prices cannot be lowered is definitely not due to the psychological effects of merchants. The biggest reason is the large amount of currency in circulation and the obstruction of transportation. To reduce currency circulation, it is necessary to gradually shrink the currency supply. To facilitate transportation, it is necessary to strive to increase merchant ships. By allowing goods and raw materials from Southeast Asia, China, and Japan to circulate with each other, manufacturing will prosper, trade will flourish, and taxes on the way will be reduced, so prices will naturally fall without seeking to lower them. Since the phrase "low prices" is often spoken by wise men at home and abroad, it is hoped that they will pay close attention to the fundamental solutions to achieve its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Full Text of the Speech by Minister Taniiri at the Reception Held by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association the Other Day <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>At the reception held by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association to welcome Minister Taniiri yesterday, the newspaper had already provided a brief account of the Minister's speech. Now, seeing that the full text has been published in the Continental New Daily, which is more detailed, it is translated and republished to satisfy readers. Editor's Note</p>
<p>Our association has been established for more than six months. In this half year, the world situation has undergone tremendous changes. I believe that these changes will have a great and positive impact and effect on the economy of Central China. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, China and Japan have been moving towards a common goal as comrades-in-arms. The influence of Britain and the United States has been completely eliminated, and a new land of co-existence and co-prosperity is being built in East Asia. China not only assisted Japan after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, but even before the declaration of war, it was in a fraternal relationship with Japan, as if one person was serving on the battlefield and the other was guarding the rear. But now China is also standing on the front line. Although it does not have the same military equipment as Japan, it is determined to fight shoulder to shoulder on the front line, and the two countries are in the same position.</p>
<p>Because of the change in the situation, I am afraid that the Chinese gentlemen have various changes in their thoughts about Japan. There have also been great changes in the Japanese side's thoughts about China, because in the past, neither China nor Japan had the concept of taking Britain and the United States as their true common enemies, and they were not very concerned about it. But since participating in the war, there has been a clear understanding of this point. The current moment is the time for China and Japan to cooperate in actual combat, and Japan's determination is even stronger. This is the meaning of what people call Japan's new policy towards China today.</p>
<p>Japan has declared the return of concessions in China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and will gradually return them as much as possible. The Chinese side has also prepared various takeover procedures. It is now a period of preparation, and it should be implemented around the time when spring returns to the earth. Japan's new policy is definitely not a hollow policy of mere words, but a policy of action. What has already been implemented is the transfer of enemy property. Italy has also announced the return of concessions in China, and France has followed suit in taking the same measures. In the past, you may have misunderstood Japan's ambition to conquer China militarily, territorially, and economically. In fact, Japan's intention is not to conquer China. It has always regarded China as a brother and wants to make China independent and respect its autonomous sovereignty.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding economic issues. Japan's so-called implementation of the new policy has not yet been specifically made public, but it is considering gradually implementing it, and the period is probably in the spring. Shanghai and the entire Central China region have the widest range of activities for Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles, and they have a great relationship with the economy. Therefore, all unnecessary restrictions will be gradually abolished. I came to Shanghai in November last year and witnessed the economic decline of Shanghai and the severance of relations with the interior. I was deeply shocked, so I tried my best to revive Shanghai's economy as soon as possible and smooth the flow of materials in the interior. Since the scope of activities of Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial people is wide, the restrictions on the movement of materials should naturally be eased.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary for Chinese and Japanese economic circles to work together. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese, they should not aim at personal privileges and priorities, but should aim at sincere cooperation with each other. First, giving special privileges to Japanese industrialists and businessmen in the past was the worst thing and a great mistake. If this measure is abolished, and the National Government only grants special privileges to Chinese people in the future, it will be the same mistake. Second, now, in order to complete the war, regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese, they must do their best to make their best efforts. As the war progresses, it is necessary to control the wartime economy. This method should not only be implemented unilaterally by Japan or China, but should be implemented after Japan and the National Government have discussed and agreed on it.</p>
<p>However, no one should hoard goods for personal gain because of the wide range of trade, nor should they dispose of goods arbitrarily for the sake of profit. Regarding this point, I hope that people from all walks of industry and commerce will automatically come up with appropriate measures. At the current stage, it is necessary to strongly avoid any situation that goes against the purpose of the war. Third, unfortunately, we are still fighting against the Chongqing side today. The Japanese army is active in a wide area of China, and therefore, the materials needed by the Japanese army have to be requested for priority supply. On the other hand, the Japanese army uses various means to help the Chinese side revive the economy, and is willing to facilitate the purchase and transportation of materials as much as possible, regardless of whether they are Chinese or Japanese.</p>
<p>Although what has been said about the above economic issues is abstract, I believe that it will definitely promote future policies in this direction. From this, we can see that Japan has no intention of conquering China, and we also believe that China has no intention of conquering Japan's economy. As a group of people who deeply understand the economic relationship between China and Japan, we must reiterate that the new policy must be a policy that can be implemented. However, there are still economic issues that we cannot do, and we still need your activities. The activity itself lies in the industrial and commercial circles. I sincerely hope that you will cooperate closely, understand each other, and strive for great achievements.</p>

<p>Japanese Gold Yen Wholesale Price Index Since 1939</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government implemented a fixed price system for important materials. Today, due to the necessity of objective circumstances, all kinds of commodities have been widely implemented with a fixed price system. The fixed price is determined by wages, transportation costs, etc., and due to changes in wages and transportation costs, the fixed price is also changed from time to time. The following is the national wholesale price index compiled by the Bank of Japan since the end of 1939 (July 1937 = 100)</p>
<p>The above end of 1942 is the statistics for November of that year. (Recorded from the Japanese "Current Financial Situation in Japan" No. 73)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Improvement of Gaofu Jujubes <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>There is a shortage of Gaofu jujubes arriving, and the market inventory is not thick. Particularly good goods, which are solid, large, and red, are especially scarce. In addition, sales have been quite active recently, so the market price has increased again, with a difference of about 70 yuan from the previous price. The prices of high-grade goods and secondary goods have also fluctuated by nearly 100 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e50">A Symposium on Future Price Countermeasures Was Held Yesterday by the "Economic World" of This Newspaper, Listening to the Opinions of Leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Sectors <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The price issue has become the focus of discussion among people in the current society. The editorial of this newspaper has also repeatedly elaborated on price countermeasures. At 4:00 PM yesterday, Li Quanshi, Pan Yangyao, and Liu Yunfang from the "Economic World" of this newspaper specially held a tea party at the conference room of the New Asia Construction Company to invite leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors in this city to discuss future price countermeasures. Those who participated in the discussion included Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Guanqun, Shi Boquan, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Haibo, Qiu Liangrong, Yao Zhongba, Zhu Binyuan, Chen Derong, Shi Ziquan, Zhang Yifan, Shen Junshuo, and more than 20 others. A symposium on price issues was held on the spot, and opinions were exchanged with each other. The conclusions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding future price countermeasures, the expectations for the government authorities are about six points:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the Production of Raw Materials Raw materials are the main elements of production enterprises. It is hoped that as much as possible will be supplied and allocated from what can be obtained within the peaceful area.</p>
<p>(2) Dredge the Source of Materials Promoting the exchange of materials inside and outside is the prerequisite for solving the lack of materials. It is hoped that the transportation mechanism will be adjusted to facilitate the exchange of materials.</p>
<p>(3) Pay Attention to the Control Method Control should be flexible, so that the people's needs for food, clothing, and shelter are not lacking. It is hoped that the control aspect can be appropriately adjusted, that the control over items needed by the people can be relaxed, that the control over unnecessary items can be tightened, and that the overall price limit for daily necessities is especially expected to have thorough and effective measures.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthen Trade Associations The government authorities also recognize that commercial joint organizations are in urgent need of adjustment. It is hoped that trade associations will be strengthened, so that each industry can manage and report on itself to assist the government authorities.</p>
<p>(5) Strictly Ban Hoarding Hoarding is a tool to destroy price control. It is hoped that the control regulations will be strengthened and hoarding will be strictly banned.</p>
<p>(6) Pay Attention to Advocating Thrift Saving consumption is the most important point that cannot be ignored in price countermeasures. It is hoped that the saving of materials will be specially advocated, so as to reduce the panic of materials.</p>
<p>It is firmly believed that the above points can be used as a reference for solving the price problem and promoting the price limit policy. Finally, it is hoped that the Price Control Office will hire appropriate people from the local economic circles as soon as possible to participate in discussing the most effective implementation methods for price countermeasures.</p>
