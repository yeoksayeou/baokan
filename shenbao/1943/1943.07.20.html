<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國復興與海洋政策</h3>
<p>二十世紀是海洋勢力制覇的新時代，也是歐美海洋勢力沒落和東方海洋勢力興起的時代。日本在本世紀初擊敗帝俄東西海洋上艦隊以後，一躍而爲世界三大海洋强國之一，求及半世紀而再顯威力驅逐其餘二大海洋强國——英美在東亞勢力，獲得空前勝利，使每一個東亞人民感覺「太平洋畢竟是太平洋人之太平洋的榮譽」！所以，今日吾人紀念「海」，同時回顧數十年來太平洋上的奮鬥史，能不爲東亞民族解放前途而謳歌？</p>
<p>我國雖自古爲大陸閉關之國，但自渤海灣沿山東半島而南，經江淅閩粵，歷廣州灣而至東京灣，綿延數千里，海岸錢之長，在世界海洋國一中，實佔重要地位，北起渤海黃海，東有東海，南至南海，海域之廣，並不亞於世界各海洋國家。而遠自隋唐以來，海外交通事業，即已開始發展，至元明之際，乃稱極盛，尤其是明代「十三太保」鄭和之巡行南洋，使中國海外活動區域，益形擴展，東及西里伯斯，南至爪哇，西至印度洋各島，一時以南洋全域爲我第二故鄉。至有淸一代，雖因列强侵凌，國勢衰落，然以海道大開，五洋已若比隣，因此華僑足跡，乃遍及歐洲，在海外成家立業者，乃無慮以數百萬計，近數十年來，中國革命事業之得助於海外同胞者實居極大部份，故政府對華僑之助力雖微，而海外僑胞則無異爲祖國擴張海域，使中國不再固閉於大陸，形成一大海洋之國。當此英美對東亞的桎梏漸告粉碎，太平洋重入東亞民族之手的新時代，如何與日本及其他東亞民族廓淸海城，建設共存共榮之新基業，吾人實責無旁貸。</p>
<p>就我國當前處境與國家需要而言，第一當爲海軍之再建。我國以海岸綫之綿長及海域之廣大，在國防意義上之需要强大的海軍，始足以自固而保衛東亞，殆無絲毫疑問。况當此新時代，欲保國家之强盛與合理發展，亦決不能不以最大國力以經營海軍。我國自淸末李鴻章張之洞諸先輩力倡富國强兵之說，始建海軍，然以缺乏領導人物，不旋踵而全部毀滅。民國以來雖有海軍之名，而無其實。事變以來，乃又完全覆沒。當此太平洋大局澄淸，我國業已擺脫次殖民地地位而走向獨立更生大道之際，無論爲國防或爲東亞防衛起見，都應從速建立海軍，並爲針對過去慘痛之經騐而當重視於新人材之培育，並由國家自主的統一的經營之。</p>
<p>其次，吾人在海之紀念日不能不痛感今日造船事業之急待振興。蓋爲重建海軍，固須同時創辦造艦事業，而爲發展國家經濟，振興工商百業，亦當自造船着手，此僅從一國之利而言。如更進一步，則當知在此太平洋諸民族解放戰爭勝利發展中，舉凡我國與日本及南洋各地物資之交流，以及其他人力物力之協助，都有　於造船事業之發　。若從軍事觀點言，現在的世界戰爭爲艱苦的長期戰，最後勝利不僅待決於前綫，尤待決於後方戰爭資源之開發與補給，大東亞區內人力物資之豐富，本已具備必勝的條件，然如何地盡其利，物盡其用，則首有待於造船運輸事業之發展，故今日中國，無論爲本國或爲東亞，　必須展開造船事業，特別是華中地區，爲盡量利用內河各水道及沿海航行，木船及小型運輸艦　之建造，尤不容或緩。</p>
<p>此外，我們在海之紀念日，不能不念及我沿海六省居民生活之改善，及海產業之振興問題。其中尤以山東，浙江，福建，廣東四省，居民之極大部份，依賴海洋爲活，一部份是渡海飄洋而至各國經營工商，爲構成華僑的最主要份子，一部份是經營漁業，此外沿海六省之從事於鹽產及航運業者亦頗不少。中國之富，向賴沿海，沿海之富，悉在於上述各業。事變以後，情勢推移，此向爲中國富源之沿海，以交通之斷絕與貿易之衰落，而陷於貧困，殆爲不可否認之事實。吾人今日即宜努力於（一）華僑之指導與協助，並儘速使與其故鄉恢復聯系，對於華僑匯款，尤當予以特別便利，俾其家屬不致流離死亡。（二）整理及振興漁業及其他水產業，由國家及金融業協助漁民及中小水產業者發展其事業，以改善沿海民生。（三）改善及發展沿海名地鹽業及航運業。所有這些，同時也都是爲着發展國家經濟必要的步驟。</p>
<p>海之紀念日，不僅爲日本，而且在中國今日，具有特別重要之意義，我們除了上述感想之外，更盼望各專家或潛心研究，或共同討論，或提出計劃，務使二十世紀五十年代的新中國，可以矗立於太平洋上，爲保障其和平與自由的一大勢力。</p>
<h3>我們需要一個純粹的上海市民意機關</h3>
<p>上海租界正式交還之期，在中國歷史上最可紀念的一天，日益迫近，我們應如何迎接這歷史的一天，相信關係各當局都已有充分的準備了。租界交還後上海市民意機關一事，在今日，注意的人似乎着實不少；並悉市政當局也早有於交還租界後相當時期內籌設民意機構之意，與各方要求及輿論相符，實可慶幸。在這各方熱切關懷之中，我們竊願鄭重提出以下三點意見，以期各界研究與指正：</p>
<p>第一，租界在中國，爲百年來萬民怨恨所集的對象。至於民意機關，在上海租界內，嚴格的說，從來沒有見過，但是，過去英美爲了欺騙一般中國居民起見，曾容許成立若干似是而非的組織。這些組織，今後自然不應容許其存在。今後如果存在，或加以改組，結果，縱有少數人擁護，但必爲大多數市民所反對。所以，我們要明確地表示，除非不要民意機關，否則，就得集合各方力量，創設純粹民意的新機構。</p>

<h3>新幾內亞阿伊河東　日軍擴大戰果中　乘夜急襲消滅美軍及登陸設施　所羅門空戰擊落敵機七十七架</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午三時三十分發表：（一）日軍新機內亞島守備隊之一部，繞道至敵軍第一綫後方，於七月十七日夜急襲阿伊河東方之美軍登陸地點及汽車部隊。消滅其登陸設施及該地之敵軍，幷殲滅敵汽車部隊，現正繼續擴大戰果中。（二）新佐治亞島孟達附近日守備隊，屢次擊退　有坦克車之敵軍進攻，幷於七月十七日砲擊企圖上陸之敵魚雷艇帬，使之潰退。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午三時三十分發表所羅門帬島方面日海軍航空部隊七月十五·十六·十七三日之戰果如次：（一）七月十五日，轟炸魯比亞納島之敵陣地，予以極大損害，並與敵機約五十架交戰，擊落其十九架，日機十架未歸還。（二）七月十六日，轟炸瓦尼可羅（　大克廬斯帬島中之一）及資拉基。瓜達康納爾，予停泊於各該地中之敵船舶以相當損害。（三）七月十七日與來襲玻根維爾島之敵機一百六十七架交戰，　落其五十八架，日方損失九架。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據墨爾本電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部，十八日發表：（甲）日軍航空部隊七月十六日及十七日夜，曾轟炸瓜達康納爾島，美軍兵員及各種設施均遭損害。（乙）日軍航空部隊曾投彈轟炸薩伏島。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　新佐治亞島日·美兩軍之戰鬥，似已日益激烈。據倫敦來電，倫敦每日郵報從美軍之特派員特納，曾傳該方向日軍英勇善戰之精神，大意謂：吾人係全賴金屬武器之力，而欲　倒日本，但日本之反攻，至爲勇猛，雖普　　事尚屬平穩，但至夜間，即展開　　之血戰。日軍每於日沒以後，即　擊隱匿於美軍野營地帶　　內之美軍，以所偑刺刀實行肉搏，美軍如一開砲，頗爲日軍所望，知其陣地所在，而向之投擲手溜彈，因此美軍之開砲，頗爲日軍所望，故美軍不敢開砲，且不得不在暗中伏於泥水沒脛之壕溝內，以防日軍進攻。日軍又以伏在密林中到處進擊，以炫惑美軍，幷時學鳥鳴，以互通音訊，使美軍無從　　其塲所，故日軍之夜襲，已使美軍陷於神經衰弱之窘狀。</p>
<h3>東綫中南部　激戰進行中　德軍界稱已入新階段</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德元首行營十八日發表戰况如次：東綫中部之戰鬥，已擴大至南部地區，情形日益激烈。蘇軍連日進攻庫班橋等堡，庫畢姆斯克西　之德軍丘陵陣地，惟迄今亳無收獲。又蘇軍曾於猛烈之砲擊後，以步兵部隊及戰車集團圖破唐納資戰綫之德軍陣地，被德軍猛烈反攻，蘇軍已受挫而退。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　軍界人士宣稱：東綫中段戰事，自蘇軍屢作　助之企圖後，已轉入新階段。現空前未有之，正在庫班橋頭至苗斯　唐納資前綫一帶，及貝爾格勒區域至奧萊爾以北間，激烈進行，蘇聯已損失坦克車五一四輛，飛機一二七架。須知此項發展，早在德軍預料之中現奧萊爾與貝爾格勒之戰事，仍爲全綫激戰之中心點，奧萊爾區尤其爲城北部份，戰事更爲慘烈。蘇軍雖以大批坦克車隊爲協助，仍不能突破德方陣綫，並損失坦克車一二六輛，庫斯克凸出點，及奧萊爾以北，雙方均以坦克車應戰，蘇方此役，又損失二一八輛，蘇軍曾加緊進攻苗斯區之德軍陣地，又蘇軍在唐納資方面，雖屢次以重型及超重型坦克車進攻，仍無效果。</p>
<h3>粵省舉行　縣長會議</h3>
<p>中央社廣州十九日電　省府爲增强戰時地方施政，特於本月十九日起至二十一日止一連三天，舉行第六次全省市縣長會議。十九日爲會議第一日上午九時在省府曁綏署聯合週會中舉行開會禮，出席者陳省長以下各廳處長，各市縣長各局長，綏署各處長等三百餘人。行禮如儀後，由陳省長訓話，至十時週會畢，隨即舉行會議。</p>
<h3>川省水災　損失極重</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據成都消息，川省一帶自本月初旬以來，即豪雨不止，因而釀成水災。該地區之農作物人畜傷亡損失極大，尤以岷江上游河水暴漲，致金剛堤飛沙堤等，均相繼決口，荘園田地，盡被淹沒，　狀至慘。川省水利局刻正努力防水及救護工作。</p>
<h3>內散藤繼任　昭南市長</h3>
<p>昭南十九日中央社電　自前昭南特別市長大達茂雄氏就任東京市長官後，其後任人選，日現地當局與中央間即進行折衝，茲憶決定起用陸軍司政長官內藤寬一氏，幷已徵得該氏同意，日政府就此於十八日發表如次：任命陸軍開發中心政長官內藤寬一爲昭南特別市長。</p>
<h3>華北日軍發表　六月份戰果</h3>
<p>北京十九日中央社電　日華北派遣軍十九日下午一時發表，六月中綜合戰果如次：交戰次数一〇四六次，（內共軍八另七次）渝共交戰兵力累計一六三三九九人。（內共軍八另三二五人）覆滅渝共設施二六九處，（內共軍二三另外）渝共棄屍八七二六具，）內共軍四另五八具）被俘五七二一人，（內共軍一六六一人）日軍鹵獲平射砲一門，對戰車砲四門，迫擊砲十三門，重機槍十二挺，輕機槍八六挺，步槍四三三二枝，及其他兵器子彈被服　秣等甚夥。</p>
<h3>蘇民眾大會席上　汪主席演講詞</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　此爲汪主席在七月一日蘇州民眾大會之演說，當時因錄音機突生阻礙，以致記錄不全，最近始由主席抽暇親自錄出，用特全文披載，以慰讀者之望。中央社謹誌</p>
<p>當淸鄉二週年紀念的時候，我能在大會裏與各界民眾見面，心中實在愉快，自舉行淸鄉以來，因爲友邦將士的援助，肅淸工作得以順利的進行，同時各界民眾在李省長領導之下，同心協力，使淸鄉事業逐步展拓，得到今日的成績。兄弟心中實在說不盡的敬仰，和感謝。</p>
<p>關於淸鄉事業的囘顧和現在及將來應有的努力，我今晨在淸鄉紀念館裏，曾有一番說話，明後日報紙上可以見到，這裏不用重說。如今所要講的，是從淸鄉說到大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>三十年七月一日，舉行淸鄉之始，我曾經標明淸鄉之目的在樹立局部和平，以促進全面和平。這是說如果先從一局部地方做到保障治安增加生產，則和平的模範已經有了，自然可以展拓開去，以及於全面。去年七月一日舉行淸鄉一週年紀念的時候，時局已進了一步了，這是因爲自從大東亞戰爭以來，前方甘心做英美的鷹犬，來反噬東亞的同胞，若要做到全面和平，須先從擊滅英美着手，因此淸鄉之目的，要一步而爲協力大東亞戰爭，我在今日曾經鄭重聲明。今晨走進淸鄉紀念館裏，看見我去年今日所標明的，淸淸楚楚貼在牆上，可作淸鄉區內同胞同志頃刻不忘，我心中十分安慰，並且十分興奮。自從今年一月九日以來，從今中國已經參加大東亞戰爭，責任更重大了，各位同胞同志的工作，從近處說，是淸鄉，從遠處說，是協力大東亞戰爭，例如保障治安，從近處說是淸鄉區內匪共絕跡，人民各得安居樂業，從遠處說，是保障大東亞戰爭的後方，使前綫將士無後顧之慮。例如增加生產，從近處說，是淸鄉區內人民能在農業上工業上增加生產的數量，把民力培養起來，從遠處說，是大東亞戰爭的後方特效豐富，不虞缺乏，這是取得最後勝利的必要條件。說到大東亞戰爭，這是凡屬東亞民族所應有的天經地義，因爲我大東亞的戰爭，旣然大東亞人，就應該保衛東亞，這是無疑義的。中國有一句話，心安理得。又有一句話，理直氣壯。百年以來英美由南洋及東太平洋向着東亞包圍進攻。中國已成了他們的次殖民地，只有一個日本與之相抗。這次的大東亞戰爭，是日本爲首與英美宣戰，接着中國滿洲泰國一致參加。召集東自菲律賓西至緬甸，都風起雲湧，來參加了。其唯一目的，在團結束亞民族，以保衛東亞，把英美勢力驅逐出去，不使再來。這樣的大東亞戰爭，凡是東亞民族沒有一個不應該發奮的。只要心安理得，成敗利鈍，在所不計，只要理直氣壯，一定有成無收。</p>
<p>將　們的團結束亞民族來保衛東亞，與渝方的甘心與英美的別動隊來反嘯東亞。一相比較，一順一逆，事理昭然。渝　所藉口的是抗戰，已經多年，如今和英美在一起，可以達到抗戰之目的，這種藉口不値一駁。如果抗戰之目的是爲救國，那麽和英美在一起救國，目的如何達到。大東亞戰爭是必勝的，固無可疑。即使如渝方所咒詛，須知大東亞戰爭失敗，即是東亞的覆亡，試問渝方何能獨存。不看見印度嗎？爲什麽甘地先生以七十高年寗願受牢獄之苦，不爲英國所誘利呢！因爲上一次大戰，英國騙了印度，所以如今不再受騙了。爲什麽鮑斯先生要率領印度救國之士反抗英國呢？因爲知道只有參加大東亞戰爭得到勝利，才是印度解放的不二法門。英美對西亞如是，對東亞不會兩樣。渝方却去　　英美來解放中國。這是如何的荒誕。我們同胞深深知道大東亞人來保衛東亞是順的，以東亞人來　東亞是逆的。大義旣明，我想渝方除了極少數喪心病狂者外，大多數終是要走到我們這邊來。（未完）</p>
<h3>義官報昨宣布　羅馬首次被炸　損失及傷亡在調查中</h3>
<p>羅馬十九日中央社電　今日義軍司令部官報宣布反軸心機猛炸羅馬事，損失詳情及傷亡人數尚在調查中。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，美陸軍部今晨發表，北非美空軍重轟炸機，及中型轟炸機隊，十六日晨曾轟炸羅馬。按羅馬爲敎廷梵蒂岡宮殿之所在地，且市內貴重史跡極多，美空軍轟炸此歷史性之羅馬，實足以證明反軸心軍對義大利之神經戰業已失敗矣，故於萬分困難之餘，遂揭發其所謂人道主義。</p>
<h3>美飛機工廠　僱用傷兵</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十九日中央社電　據華盛頓電：美國因苦于勞力之不足，乃利用此次大戰受傷免除兵役者，使之從事產業工作。新近利福尼亞之堪薩斯吉克薩斯等州之飛機工廠，已僱用此等傷兵。</p>
<h3>渝派員赴西安　商對中共辦法</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　渝共傾軋之歸趨如何，已頗爲各方所注目，前據確息，包圍共黨根據地陜甘寧邊區之渝軍先鋒部隊，曾於本月十七日起，攻擊共軍，以致共軍傷亡慘重，現聞共黨方面爲嚴厲軍隊配備於前衛陣地，同時立即向吾西北軍區賀龍吿急。故賀龍亦已派隊前往增援。又傳　空軍司令毛邦初所部轟炸機隊，亦曾於十七日兩次出動，飛往西北方面，眾料渝方仍將乘此機會，企圖自空中威　其軍。</p>
<p>（又電）據此間所接消息，渝方「最高國防會議」於蔣介石視察成都軍事情形返抵重慶後，即於十八日召開臨時緊急會議，到何應欽·商震·孔祥熙·周至柔·陳果夫·陳立夫·陳誠·及楊杰等，協議應付渝共關係之各種方策事後商楊周等即根據此次會議所決定之方針，飛往西安，與朱紹良·蔡瑟文·胡宗南·楊愛源等，西北各首腦部，召開會議，對於該方面之具體對策，似已有最後決定。</p>

<h3>日地方長官　昨舉行會議　多年懸案均解決</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日政府爲集中一億國民總力。推進中央地方一致之決戰施策起見，特於十九日上午八時起，在首相官邸召開地方長官會議。出席者有東京都大達長官，北海道坂長官，樺太廳大津長官，曁其他二府，四十三縣知事，薄田警視總監，加藤憲兵司令官曁其他關係人員等，政府方面有東條首相，安藤內相及全體閣僚，星野書記官長及內閣四長官及內閣四長官及關係人員等。首由東條首相披瀝日政府應付目下重大時局之決意，繼由重光外相說叫目下國際情勢，至九時四十分，安藤內相曁各出席長官晋宮謁見天皇陛下致敬，退出後，再度齊集首相官邸，於十時三十分開始協議，首由山崎農相就糧食增產對策，加以說明，繼由各長官就地方情形，率直陳述意見，並協議確立決戰下糧食增產之中央地方一致之施策方針。正午稍息後，下午一時再度協議，安藤內相詳細闡明整備企業等擴充生產力方策後，即開始協議擴充生產力之具體措施。至下午三時就交通運輸勞務及增强戰力等當前各問題，以出席各閣僚爲中心，進行協議。至五時三十分，會塲移至內相官邸，再就地方行政協議會運營方針等內務行政問題，舉行協議後，會議即吿完畢。按此次日本地方長官會議，會期僅有一日，惟時間雖短，然已將第八十二屆臨時議會所通過之決戰諸施策及地方行政協議會，多年運營重要懸案，全部獲得解決，至增產糧食及整備企業之具體施策等，亦已決定圓滿措置，故此次會議之意義，實至重大。</p>
<p>東條首相致訓</p>
<p>東京十九日　中央社電日本臨時地方長官會議，十九日開幕，東條首相曾即席訓詞，其要意如次：當今世界戰局已趨決戰之秋，情况至爲緊張，各種困難，當所不能避免，敵方所蒙困難，當較我方尤困難，爲克服此困難之關鍵，唯有奮勇作戰，努力增强戰力，而後始能得獲勝利。當此之秋，我國於戰爭指導上所最應努力者，蓋爲積極擴大戰果，强化戰力，幷加强與各盟邦之提携，發揮其堅强性。俾便痛擊頑敵，我英勇將士，即本此要諦，善用其戰略優勢，以消滅敵軍反攻之戰力。幷强化重要據點之防地準備，積極加强協力，進而集結大東亞十億民族幷總力，急速使共榮圈內之資源戰力化，俾使充實，途行戰爭之所需，余前言歷訪中滿兩國及菲島，今復訪問泰國及視察南方各地，得睹我軍所至各地，民族莫不衷心願予協力，深爲快慰，幷窺知大東亞龐大之資源已日益戰力化，致使余大東亞戰爭必勝，大東亞建設必成之信念益趨不疑。帝國爲適應大東亞各國家各民族之此種誠意之協力，更將採用種種友善施策，爲謀東亞之福祉，而積極進行，俾東亞團結一致，共同建設共榮圈。同時更需永久根據道義之精神，繼續努力，使大東亞各國家各民族均得脫離英·美之桎梏而解放。</p>
<p>增强戰力問題</p>
<p>東條首相繼又述及增强戰力問題，大意謂：日政府根據確保戰時國民生活之安定及急速增强戰力之二大目的，以實行國內各項施策，現正以增强主要糧食之自給及整頓企業，以急速增强戰力作中心，迅速實行强力施政。惟鑒於目前戰局實必須極神速果敢以進行，爲增强戰力而整頓企業，自中日事變勃發以來，迄至今日已相繼付諸實施，但隨戰局之進展，對於過去屢行之整頓，必須更急速加以擴充强化，此項整頓企業之目的，完全注重於增加戰力作切實有機的利用。日本整個經濟力·作戰力，自不待言，更舉資材動力運輸力等，一切悉集中於增强戰力，即無分男女老幼，盡其材配置於適當處所，使其參加增加戰力，排除一切冗費或將各種特效貢獻增强戰力，故此次措置誠爲劃期之創舉，俾一億國民人人均能貢獻於增强戰力。同時整頓施設機具等，利用於增强戰力之產業決戰體制，於是一億國民雖戰務各異，實際由已一齊參加增强戰力，而貢獻於戰爭之　途，又東條首相對設置地方行政　議會以成地方新制度一　，亦有詳盡訓示，出席人員無不深爲感　。</p>
<h3>英國文學與英國的興廢（一）</h3>
<p>英國學者沒有人說起維多利亞朝的女學。但從歷史上看來，文學如何與英國的盛衰隆替有關係，想在這裏略加考察。我固沒有討論英國的專門知識。可是從維多利亞朝的初期至中期，即使不能說是英國文學的最高峯，至少也可以說是絢爛時代罷！以此與伊利薩伯時代的文學比較起來，其熱鬧與絢爛，有過之無不及。小說方面有沙加萊，狄根斯，詩人有丁尼生，白郎寗，散文有麥者萊，加萊爾。在文學的任何那方面，大家，名家輩出，不遠一一枚舉。而其文學在我們眼裏看來，均極健全，有國運興隆的徵象，並又有其刺戟力，指導力。</p>
<p>麥考萊一夜成名</p>
<p>茲試略述其一二於下。例如麥考萊，因爲他生前頗負盛名，故死後很有許多人指摘他的短處。雖然如此，但他的論文在今日讀來，確爲一種自修敎育的最高資料。猶如其歷史，他所做的，在那時期，不作第二人想，麥考萊不是哲學家，而是常識家。不是叛徒，而是順民。不是走在時代的前面者，而是跟着時代走的人。然而他是有血性的黨人，他始終是灰格黨</p>
<h3>英國悲劇餘論之四　德富豬一郎</h3>
<p>（Whig　Party）（保學黨前身）的勇將，在文法上，在政界上，發揮其靈活的手腕。撇開他的歷史，就他的一切作品來看，抑揚過甚，濃淡過多，光明與陰翳過大，因此往往招致物議。然而像他那樣且有健全的文學的良心而感覺銳敏者，不可多得。</p>
<p>他欲叙述一件事，不厭其煩地涉獵百卷參考書，記載一件事，不遠千里的親自去實地視察。他的文章看起來猶如德國的盛大閱兵式，極荘嚴雄偉的大觀。然而這決不是一所呵成的。在大英博物館見到他的原稿者，沒有人不驚奇於他字琢句磨的工夫者。他自從二十餘歲時，他的「寗爾頓論」問世，一夜中便天下爲之驚倒，至六十餘歲時，未完成其歷史的原稿而喪志以沒，在這中間，始終如一，幾沒有什麽變化。換句話說，雖沒有進步，但也決沒有退步。如巴覺特所說：「今日的他是昔日的他，昔日的他是今日的他」。他對馬勃爾公爵家的遠祖邱吉爾用了頗爲辛辣的筆加以描寫。因此，現在的英國首相邱吉爾爲沈雪先視的不白之寃，盡其渾身的力著述「馬勃爾公傳」。然而大多數人不爲邱吉爾　護，倒反而造成馬考萊的彈劾；所謂死麥考萊驅使活邱吉爾，即指此事。</p>
<p>自第一版社評第二篇轉來</p>
<p>七月十七日報載駐滿洲國　大使在滬，正擬具改組納稅會方案，其大意是：「今租界收回以後，事實上已屬無事可辦，如將該會結束，又非常可惜，擬史改名稱，重新改組，旣可保存光榮之史跡，又可作新興之事業，實爲兩全之策」。我們仔細加以研究，從實際方面言，認爲不敢苟同，我們知道，過去納稅會參加份子，不少努力與公正人士，但其性質與任務，實爲租界之產物，爲適應租界之需要而存在者，今租界已不存在，而今後上海之新生建設，又非舊時納稅會所能盡其民意機關的機能。所以，從實際需要上，納稅會應隨租界之交還而撤消；旣已無事可辦，即不能以結束爲可惜而勉强改組，　　形式。况該會之性質，實無演變爲今後市民民意機關之可能。</p>
<p>第二，關於民意機關的人選問題，必須出於極謹愼的態度。爲了以後眞正發生的　意機關的作用，發揮其代表市民喉舌，民意機關的人選，不論其階層，黨派或職業關係，都必須眞正來自民間，尤必須以工商界中爲市民所信仰的公正人士爲中心，絕不允許容納爲一黨一派或某一小集團的利益而來的份子，至於現任政府官吏自亦宜廻避而不參加其事。這是一個眞正的民意機關的基本原則，如稍違背這一原則，便失其民意機關的眞實意義。</p>
<p>第三，民意機關之早日創設，爲各界所渴望，但是，租界正式收回之期眾已迫近，要在短期內，籌設一個完善的民意機關，爲事實上所不許可，我們尤宜體念當局目前急於行政方面之布置，不及同時並進。當知民意機構之成立與否，僅爲時間問題，在倉卒之間，可稍待一兩個月，以求有充分的時間籌備。同時，這是關係市民權益與國家社會前途的大事，因此，我們希望社會先進各界有志人士大家加以研究討論，向關前當局或在報章發表意見，集思廣益，以舉事功。</p>
<p>爲着新生上海的前途，爲着這一頁未來歷史的光輝，我們不覺立言率直，想必爲有道君子所共諒，尤盼各方面之指正。</p>

<h3>新聞聯合會宣傳　節約運動週　每月九日爲節約日</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會因鑒于近代戰時國家，均以節約物資爲求　後勝利之要圖，滬上奢靡之風特盛，物資浪費尤鉅，不特影響戰時物力，抑且刺激物價館高漲，爲糾正社會人心，特發起節約運動，經該會理事會議决，另設節約運動專門委員會，擬且推行引貫施具體辦法，經兩次會議確定第一步工作計劃，至實施辦法亦已由理事會通過，茲將决定各要點錄左：</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>不吃糧不掮槍的無名英雄</h3>
<p>昨日報載方九　銀樓發生被刦事件，當有自警團員沈荷淸君，奮勇攔阻强徒，致遭擊斃，英勇殉職。從這一事件，可以見到自警團員對於目前社會組織與地方治安之維護，實有極大的力量與功效。沈荷淸君之殉職，可以堅定人民信賴自警團的心理，也表　了市民自治的能力與服務的道德。沈荷淸君之爲全市民所讚美，雖死猶生，張一鵬先生所贈輓聯：「這個能盡忠能殉職的大好榜樣。倒是不吃糧不掮槍的無名英雄。」「攔腰一抱　　成擒收囘租界先頭　：瞑目九原精神不死奮起民間生力軍。」眞正是全上海市民共同的感想啊！我們希望，每個自警團員都具備着無名英雄的精神。</p>
<h3>防疫證逾期　應再度注射</h3>
<p>市區及兩租界　虹口區衛生當局，於四月份起施行全市防疫注射劑　，瞬將三月，按之規定，應於三個月後，施行防疫再注射，藉期審民絕對健康，根本消滅時疫發生。現悉各該負責方面，已積極開始注射工作，查騐防疫證明書，逾期者即予注射，並重新填發該項證明書，八月一日開始全面查騐該證明書之有無更換，如未更換者，立予注射防疫針劑，屆時將對水陸舟車，施行全面檢查。</p>
<h3>新普育堂素描　無吿者的大觀園　貧病老幼殘廢浸浴在博愛的光輝中</h3>
<p>南市國貨路，一百二十餘畝的廣塲上，遠在民國元年，就由陸伯鴻氏捐款建造這座貧·病·老·幼·殘廢者的「大觀園」。這裏有四洋風的園林，有本國式的花圃菜畦，這裏有新式的學校·醫院·禮拜堂和簡單的工塲，形成一個新的社會。</p>
<p>這新社會——新普育堂的負責人裏于充氏，實際在埋頭苦幹慘淡經營的是天主敎修道姆姆和男女工友，姆姆們多數來自歐美各國，華藉的也不少。她們都曾受過相當高深的敎育，在天主敎敎義的啟示之下，拋棄了高等享受，來爲苦難無吿者服務，她們所謂的事業，大體上可分爲、（一）養老院，（二）殘廢院，（三）孤兒院，（四）施醫院。此外，還有孤寡住舍與義務學校等。歷年陣容總數，不下十餘萬人，最近（三十二年六月）養老院二〇二人，殘廢部一三六人，　　部一五六人，孤兒部二三九人，幼稚部一九四人，難民五四人，職員僱工五七人，合計爲一千零三十八人。此外義校走讀生約一百二十人，每天施診給藥及門口收養棄嬰的人數也不少。在上海慈善機關中，應該算是規模最大的一個了。</p>
<p>笑聲洋溢的育嬰部</p>
<p>育嬰部，　文化園林中的幾幢洋房裏，　有不　窄小的花園和　戲場。嬰兒多數由貧苦同胞送去的，據　導參觀的「大姆姆」談，經費雖然困難，但對棄嬰是永遠不忍拒收的。經過檢查，有病的送往病嬰部。爲着嬰孩特殊的需要，還不能收羅些奶粉之類。孩子們見大姆姆來了，親熱地問候，姆姆也微笑地摸他們，給記者抱抱，滿院洋溢着笑聲，這年頭，誰不羨慕這裏活潑　的一帬幸運兒呢？據說，從這裏撫養長大，代爲婚嫁的已經不少。</p>
<p>走上正路的孤兒們</p>
<p>新普育堂的孤兒，除一小部份由外面送來之外，都由育嬰堂長大的，大部份是女孩。年齡最小的編爲幼稚部，男女同居，穿着一式的制服和膠鞋，活潑地遊戲着，見參觀者來了，由該部負責姆姆和敎員領導着起身問候。較大的大約初小程度，分級敎學。她們愛惜公物，例如用過的作文簿，都翻轉來改釘再寫。　裏有一個雲珍小姑娘，是二十六年軍隊西退時三百餘遇難孤兒中惟一的得救者，姆姆講起當時鐵門邊搶救孤兒的故事，雲珍姑娘小眼裏閃動着淚珠了。高小程度的孤兒，男女分別敎養，有些還送往堂外去求學。從前，男孤兒留養到替他們成家能夠自立，然後出堂。現在，由於經費不足，只養到十六歲，就介紹到工商界去習藝，憑他們去自力更生了。高年級孤兒已有相當知識，能體諒堂方困苦，所以吃穿都比年幼者粗劣些。女孤兒到相當年齡，就帮她們擇婿。</p>
<p>慷慨話舊養老院</p>
<p>養老院分男女兩部，經常留養人數各約一百名左右。年齡統在六十歲以上，有的由關會自經委派方面送去，有的自投求養。其間還有不少老人，且有輝煌的經歷。在女院中，記者看到一位八十一歲的曾老太，據說是一位前淸的道台夫人，她在記者詢問時只是搖頭太息，「現在，叫我怎麽說好呢？」她曾隨任到各地，現在還能說各地的方言。男院中，一位八十二歲的杭州老翁周竹楪，慷慨激昂地訴說他當年金戈鐵馬的生涯，也是因爲戰爭家破人亡而淪落的。除了那些過時的老爺太太們之外，養老院裏大多數是農工出身的。有幾個，似乎在天涯地角，還有些音訊久隔的親屬。（未完）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「上海人是新猶太人」嗎？</h3>
<p>最近，日本每日新聞社主幹下田將美氏在京謁見行政院副院長兼財政部長周　海氏時之問答，　　興趣。其中一段尤有錄供眾覽之價値：</p>
<p>下田氏問：余來上海已有二年，能感上海之……决戰妾態尚未能盡如預期，依豆油英美之自由經濟思想，依舊殘存。參戰後之中國……必須實行高度之統制經濟。自新經濟政策以來，據聞上海經濟界名流均已參加協力……</p>
<p>周氏答：上海市民百年來深受英美政府抱不滿。……北伐當時……上海之中國人亦曾反對國民政府，是以上海中國人對國民政府之非協力態度，非是今日始。質言之，上海之中國人乃係一種已失却祖國觀念之新猶太人。蔣介石爲征服此　上海中國人，不惜組織藍衣社，用暗殺手段使彼等轉向。余認爲在說明大東亞戰爭之意義及宣傳中日協力，同時亦宜採取的手段，惟此所謂力，非指……暗殺手段，而係政治的力與法律的力，如有違反統制經濟者，即應以法律之力加以懲罰。</p>
<p>上海人——尤其上海商人——讀了上段周氏談話，能何毛骨悚然！「新猶太人」之綽號，誰都不要。願我們上海商人，有則改之，無則加勉，讓我們堂堂來做個時代健兒的「新中國人」！</p>

<p>海的紀念日特輯</p>
<h3>日本的海洋精神</h3>
<p>— 綿</p>
<p>國民精神的振作，與國家發展的關會自經委派頗爲密切，而國氏精神的振作，海洋實與有重大的影響。海是镕冶國民精神的洪爐。希臘古代哲學家說：「世界上最流動的東西是水。」在這變幻多端的海上，狂風欣天，波濤洶涌，船行其中，其驚險有不可想像者。然而所有這些困難，不能不設法克服。於是養成了沈着·勇敢·敏捷的精神，這就是海洋精神。</p>
<p>與海洋精神相對立的大陸精神。這是由於環境與生活所致。大陸精神是單純的，獨善的，爭功的，縱合在個人方面說來也有勇敢的，但却不能共同一致。例如英國人是海洋的民族，法國人是大陸的民族。而目前擺在我們面前鐵一般的事實，足以證明兩者的優劣。</p>
<p>此次大東亞戰爭中，使日本有飛躍的進展的原動力者是日本精神，這日本精神也就日常生活充分的發揮。日本精神者，從遠遠的古代的祖先們，把他們的運命寄托於一葉扁舟。征服萬里的波濤，在海上消磨其生活的時代開始，斷非一朝一夕之所致。這種精神，不僅受海洋的影響，而在　船上所有乘員全體團結一致，唯船長馬首是瞻，共同進退的精神，實爲日本精神的基礎。舉例來說：日本全體是一隻船，天皇是船長，一億國民皆是水手，這是日本的全貌，是日本之精神的全體主義之思想發達的由來。大陸的國民之間，生長一種與此完全相反的唯物的個人主義思想，正因爲他們是　於被支配的環境使然。這種海洋精神的陶整，有順於海洋敎育，海上訓練的實施，非此，無以期海洋精神的振作，說到訓練問題，不能不先從兒童們說起。兒童的喜歡水是天性，因此，在實施水上訓練的指導時，應首先理解他們的心理，使他們和水親近，使他們喜愛少，讚美海，更進而研究海，於是海洋精神遂深刻地印在幼稚而不易磨滅的腦海中。</p>
<p>不僅爲了指導上的便利，而且爲了易書實效起見，組織是必要的。有組織然後有力量，這淺近的至　，我們已毋庸詳爲解釋。總之，個人加入了一種組織，就有了責任，無論孩子，女人，祗要他們有責任感，就發生出一種力量。在船上的乘客要暈船：船員們不會暈船，一半固然由於習慣，然而在養成這習慣之先，他們感到船在行駛上負有一種責任，所以不敢大意，自然不致暈船了。</p>
<p>在海洋精神的養成中，除組織外，尚須注意一點：第一是隨時在準備狀態中的，有準備庶能隨機應付，不致變起倉卒，無法應付。第二是靜　與確實。　　的事情無確實性，無破實性即易發生事故。靜肅與確實常是一件事的　面。日本精神是海洋精神之具體的顯現。海洋精神的養成，從上述看來，斷非一朝一夕之功，亦非偶然倖致。大東亞戰爭中日本能發揮其偉大的力量者，實有賴於海洋精神之所賜。</p>
<h3>海洋生活與海洋敎育</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>「海的紀念日」的意義，是要使一般人對海上生活有深切的認識。所謂海上生活者，簡單地說來，就是在軍艦內的平時生活。這是海洋敎育的第一步。</p>
<p>艦上生活可以看作一個社會，也可以看作一個家庭。是嚴厲的嚴父的敎育，與充滿着情與愛的慈母敎育的調和。這種生活的特色，有如下幾點：</p>
<p>第一，隨時隨地以航海爲本位，即在平時也似在戰塲中一般。在軍艦上，即使在休假期中，不許有半數以上的船員外出。萬一發生事故，如遇暴風或發生火災時，有充足的人員可以應付。所謂「常在戰塲」即是這種生活。一切海洋生活均以此爲基礎。</p>
<p>第二，軍艦不是衙門，是溫暖的家庭，自艦長，下至小兵，寢食與共。在戰時，這家庭就是一座城池。一切船上的乘員，與城池共存亡。全體船員親切地打成一片，因而造成最有秩序的社會。</p>
<p>第三，船員們時刻不忘的是出船精神。那就是船隻入港椗泊時，就先已掉頭作出港的準備。假使入港時就原狀拋錨，那麽出港時就要大費手脚，延遲出港的時間，在戰爭中，即使五分鐘也是爭取勝利的重大因素啊。</p>
<p>「淸潔」「整頓」的敎養。</p>
<p>淸潔，整頓者，是海上生活最重要的敎養之一。試想想在狹隘的船上，過一種集體生活，如其有一個人因不注意，不養生，而患了傳染病，豈不要蔓延到全體，所以每個人都注意到自己身體的淸潔，與服裝的整潔，自然養成淸凈，潔白的風氣。一件東西使用之後，必仍放置於原處，庶下次取用時不致手忙脚亂。這是做人的最重要習慣之一，極應該從兒童時代起即養成。</p>
<h3>火星·烟蒂比炸彈還還要可怕</h3>
<p>艦船上的每個船員，每天必須詳細作人與物的檢點。人的檢點就是上面說的淸潔與整頓，物的檢點就是船上兵器機械及其他一切的準備，而晚上的巡檢尤爲重要。每夜在船員全體安寢後，副艦長或重要將校必視察船內的一切狀况對於火星，烟蒂尤爲注意。這比炸彈還要可怕，因爲炸彈祗有在戰時才會降落下來，而火星，烟蒂隨時可成爲災害的原因。這種微細地方的注意，即在防空訓練中也十分重要。</p>
<h3>嚴守時間的精神</h3>
<p>從事海上生活的人一般均有嚴守時間的精神。如其每個人都能準守時間，無論做任何工作，可以發揮最大的效能。而這在軍艦中尤爲重要，因爲戰爭多是由時間來左右勝負的。即使一個艦隊兵力較少，但如其集中較少敵人爲速，則在敵人集中之前，己方就可取得優勢而擊破敵人。所謂協力一致者，以時間的勵行爲第一。一般社會雖也常把勵行時間放在口頭上，但迄未能澈底實行，實堪遺憾。</p>
<h3>維持秩序的重要</h3>
<p>無論從道義心看來，習性看來，秩序的維持有絕對的必要。例如從艦上降至小汽艇中，如其大家不依順序而爭先恐後，那船就有傾覆的危險。即就一般社會上來說，在乘電車，火車或一切公共塲所，依序而進則速，爭先恐後反遲。欲速則不達，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>從以上所述看來，軍艦的生活，即是嚴格的國家敎育，家庭生活，及社會生活的調和，這是海軍生活的特色。</p>
<h3>日第三次海之紀念日　渡邊民團長廣播演說</h3>
<p>七月二十日爲日本第三次海之紀念日。當地各日僑民間機關，如海軍協會上海支部，上海海事懇談會，上海日本居留民團等，特定於二十日二十一日兩日，參觀江南造船所，並參拜上海神社，默禱航行安全，追悼殉職船員，以誌紀念，日僑居留民團渡邊民團長，並先於十八日下午六時半，發表廣播演說，題爲「迎第三次海之紀念日」對於明治維新後，日本如何盡力從事海軍建設發展海運及此舉對於日本今日國運之進展，具有如何之影響，均有簡單明暸之闡述大要如下：</p>
<p>七月二十日爲海之紀念日，本年爲制定海之紀念日以來第三次紀念日，明治天皇當國內維新統一後不久即於明治九年出發視察東北地方，於同年七月十八日在函請搭乘明治丸　京，於該月二十日安抵橫濱，故即規定該日爲海之紀念日。</p>
<p>我國四面臨海無論往任何國家均非渡海不可，又國內亦會自經委派聚多數島嶼而成，故海上交通極佔重要，可以稱爲海國日本者職此故也，此自然上條件爲自古以來使我大和民族親近海洋以海洋爲背景積極活動之最大原因。</p>
<p>當嘉永六年因浦賀灣頭黑船來航，海軍思想突然勃興，又恢復海國民族之本來面目，海軍並商船隊之建設，其後極爲發展，誠有日進月異之勢。此次大東亞戰爭開戰之初，在珍珠港馬來爪哇所羅門諸役獲得震驚世界之大戰果，北起阿留地安帬島南迄澳洲西至印度洋，我軍在此廣大水域實行雄渾無比極盡豪壯之作戰</p>
<p>日本之海國魂乃以皇室爲中心爲三千年來所練成之大和魂，英國之海國魂實爲海賊魂，美國爲其枝派故同爲海賊之一家，大東亞戰爭爲大和魂與海賊魂之鬥爭，我一億國民非團結一致擊破此海賊魂不可</p>
<p>日本海運當中日事變　業已出入於世界七大海洋，完成控制英國海運之態勢，至此項商船在歷次戰爭究係如何，日俄戰爭當時陸海軍使用船舶共二百六十六艘，計六十七萬噸，較當時我國保有船舶噸數超過二萬噸，此項超過噸數乃係向外國僱用船，此外爲輸送一般民需物資起見並僱用外國船舶頗多，由此可知在作戰之際實需要莫大數量之船舶。此次大東亞戰爭爲世界有史以來所未有之大戰爭，亦爲必須集中國家物力資力人力共同努力之戰爭，故軍械資材之需要爲量極鉅，運送距離亦極遙遠，是以輸送用船唯求其眾，且船之一物亦須消耗，不獨我國爲然，無論任何交戰國對於船舶之建造，無不竭力以赴，幸日本之造船能力，極爲高超，即外國船並不輸入或僱用，亦可自力造船，且力量極爲强大也。</p>
<h3>如何强化大東亞要塞</h3>
<p>— 南孝</p>
<p>（一）海是自然的要塞</p>
<p>昔秦始皇築萬里長城，　樹立秦國萬代之基，然其聲未息，阿房宮一夜而化灰燼。法國築馬奇諾防綫，誇稱四大强國之一，而今之法國又何在呢？此種盛衰滄桑，是宇宙的定律，一貫不　的防塞就是海。唯有海洋才是天險的要塞，亦即重要的進攻根據地。何以言之？自爲地球的四分之三是海，東京的水連接南京柏林，羅馬，東京，南京的水，可遠流到倫敦和華盛頓。</p>
<p>我們當前的責任，就在如何强化大東亞要塞，應該如何從大東亞的要塞來進攻。這裏就有賴於中國應如何理解海，而來參加這大東亞的要塞。</p>
<p>（二）大東亞的要塞</p>
<p>翻開古代歷史來看，希臘的哲學文明，是以愛琴海爲要塞而繁榮，羅馬的宗敎文化，是以地中海爲要塞而興盛。在近世紀，曾經稱霸世界的海賊國漢吉利，以大西洋作根據地，榨取我們東亞民族。所以，不知　而欲成大國，不啻螻蟻去爬喜馬拉雅山峯，爬不多幾步而說：「我已經征服了喜馬拉雅山。」我們於此間知蘇聯的苦境了。</p>
<p>宇宙的定律演進，給之我們打破不法英美的海賊秩序而創造大東亞生活圈的機會，而我們現在已經築成了太平洋。印渡洋的海上大要塞。這個大要塞，有無數的前哨根據地，是擁有無限兵糧武器的寳庫，而是一個退可守，進可取的絕妙陣地。所以，出則攻擊英美，退由建設東亞。中國已經參戰，緬甸宣吿獨立，英國所視爲禁　的印度，也已崛起掂獨立，這大要塞的內部大東亞，漸漸地生成發展，努力消滅世界的不平等，還我東亞面目。中國收囘租界，泰國收囘失地，馬來，爪哇，蘇門答臘地方的土民，參加政治，菲律賓又將獨立。這數月來所有的現象，證明了大東亞要塞內部輪廓的完整。</p>
<p>天險的大要塞的內部，經百年來血與汗苦鬥而未能成功的重大懸案，一旦實現，這些大東亞內部的再建設，不外爲根據宇宙法則順理的工作，所謂大東亞的要塞，就是上面所說的太平洋，印度洋，假使有了海洋，立刻要把它築成要塞，而且在海上必須要有强大無　的海軍。所以，中國應該想想這個要塞是如何形成？如何使它强固？</p>
<p>（三）英國的海賊行徑</p>
<p>敵國英美，在十七世紀開始近世殖民運動以來，侵害我們的要塞太平洋，印度洋，從那時起，我們的苦痛日深，我們應該牢記有色人種被他們玩於掌股，當作奴隸而與他的物品交換。海賊英國侵略東亞的第一步，是以十幾個人佔領印度的一角開始，後來，發射步槍，大砲，繼續其所謂「狩獵印度人」的海賊行爲，對東亞人乃至王候，挑撥離間，促使文化衰微。英國的歷史家麥考萊，記述當時的狀况有過這樣一段記載：「黑人接二連三的倒斃，怪有趣的，今天已經射死了十一個了」，這種說法，簡直把印度人當做禽獸看待。又KA馬來遜在其所著的「印度的叛亂」一書中，有下面這樣一段，「用雙殘槍去殺男女老幼，是有趣的遊戲。」</p>
<p>然則，他們在中國幹些什麽呢？第一，用鴉片毒化國民，第二，吸收匯銀到本國。所以過去百年來，我們　　　　　　　　　，　是在偽善的文化之下，例如一般吸毒者，還是沉溺於無謂的享樂，除日本以外，東亞的任何國家，何　想到廣大海洋的作用，那裏有想謀東亞復興，創造東方文化，東亞社會的國家呢</p>
<p>（四）大東亞要塞完成了</p>
<p>日本以海洋發展爲建國的根本，以海爲生命綫。日本在此百年中一忍再忍，苦心研究，强兵富國，建設强大海軍，向擊潰非東亞的政治經濟秩序而邁進。因此，爲了建設的緣故，不得已與中國作兄弟閱牆之閧。大東亞戰爭勃發後，英美節節收退，大東亞要塞因以一舉而完成，北起阿留申帬島，南至所羅門帬島，西迄印度洋，當然，我們流了很多血才得以築成此要塞。中國事變以來，忠勇將士們血流成河，始克築成。甚至於中國的一木，租界的一石，驅逐英美的時候，也都曾染上了鮮紅的血跡，而迄今猶在鐵績粉碎不斷前來反攻大東亞要豁的英美侵略軍。我們　求中國，　　，緬甸，　　　，印度，各　其智慧在東亞的性格下繁榮起來。阿岡島玉碎，不過是擊倒了大東亞要塞的一個步哨而已。</p>
<p>（五）中國應如何强化要塞</p>
<p>我們翻開東亞近世史，不容諱言，有一頁是東亞民族的「失櫃」之頁。我們必須把前年十二月八日以後的東亞史，用光榮的「復興」的文字，來掩埋的義務</p>
<p>反過來觀察中國民眾的內部，他們以爲：「大東亞的建設祗要日本去負担，我們對於日本對英美何方獲勝，倒是很盛興味的事」，抱有這種錯誤邪念的人，事實上依然存在。其錯覺尤其的就是重慶政權。然而沒有日本，中國能保守其祖先所遺的土地嗎？中國的民族資本，能完全成就嗎？日本何以交還租界呢？日本何以培育中國的自主權呢？如其以此現象視爲日本國力的低下，那是極其淺薄的見解。我敢聲言，以英美做對手，僅有日本海軍已足夠了，假使調查日本飛行士的志願者，軍響，　船的造船能力，可以下這新斷言。如此。陸軍　可以其剩餘的兵力轉用於建設大東亞內部。我想起下面一句話，孫文先生說：「無日本即無中國，無中國亦即無日本。」過去數年來中日的歷史，已充分證明了孫文先生的話。</p>
<p>中國有强大的必要，如其要想强大，必須常注視歷史與地理。無言的東亞史，無言的海洋，明確地指示着大東亞的將來的發展方向。我熱烈希望中國應更進一步，理解海的重要。</p>
<p>世界文化繁榮到今日的地步者，實由於人類使用動力航行海上的結果。所以理解海的政治家，才能產生世界的政治家。居住於陸上的人，極言之，不過是某種盲人。某一盲人摸到象脚就說象是一根大　。某一盲人摸到象腹就說象一塊　板，某一盲人摸到象尾巴就說象是細而長的東西，同樣，居住於四川的深山中，而欲判斷數倍於亞歐大陸的，印度洋的戰况，誠爲極困難的事。我們的家中，無論如何　窮，桌上當有一本世界地圖，在戰爭中，沒有一個人可以橫斷海洋。假使中國的民眾理解海洋而研究大東亞要塞，將沒有再被英美的紳士式的煽動宣傳所迷惑罷！</p>
<p>我們想對中國的民眾進如次一言：</p>
<p>「現在及將來，如其要强國富民，須先征服海」這已經是國家發展的眞理，而「不理解海，不應該論大東亞戰爭，」這話又是此戰爭中的至言。</p>
<p>中國已經在着手整理國內的重要問題，現已參戰，而爲最有力的國家。假使口上高喊參戰，而心中取傍觀的態度者，則不能完成中國之東亞的使命，這是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>日本的建國方針是以海立國，以海爲舞台而發展，以海爲大東亞要塞而完成大東亞的保衛。我們要求中國必須注目海，如此，中國預期將爲將來的强國。同時，中國並須自覺所加於中國的責任與完成此責任的使命。（七月十九日　　合譯）</p>

        <h1>1943.07.20</h1>
<h3>China's Revival and Maritime Policy</h3>
<p>The twentieth century is a new era of maritime power dominance, and also an era of decline of European and American maritime power and the rise of Eastern maritime power. After Japan defeated the Tsarist Russian fleets in both the Eastern and Western seas at the beginning of this century, it leapt to become one of the world's three major maritime powers. After half a century, it once again demonstrated its power by driving out the other two major maritime powers—Britain and the United States—from East Asia, achieving unprecedented victory and making every East Asian person feel "the honor that the Pacific is, after all, the Pacific of the Pacific people!" Therefore, today, as we commemorate "the Sea," and also look back on the decades of struggle in the Pacific, can we not sing the praises of the future of East Asian national liberation?</p>
<p>Although our country has been a landlocked country since ancient times, from the Bohai Bay along the Shandong Peninsula to the south, through Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, passing the Guangzhou Bay to the Tonkin Gulf, stretching for thousands of miles, the length of the coastline occupies an important position among the world's maritime countries. From the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea in the north, the East China Sea in the east, to the South China Sea in the south, the vastness of the sea area is not inferior to that of various maritime countries in the world. Overseas transportation began to develop as early as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, reaching its peak during the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. In particular, Zheng He's "Thirteen Protectors" voyages to the Nanyang region during the Ming Dynasty further expanded China's overseas activities, extending east to the Celebes, south to Java, and west to the islands of the Indian Ocean, temporarily regarding the entire Nanyang region as our second homeland. During the Qing Dynasty, although the country's power declined due to the invasion of the great powers, the opening of sea routes made the five oceans seem like neighbors, so the footprints of overseas Chinese spread throughout Europe, with millions settling and building families overseas. In recent decades, the Chinese revolutionary cause has benefited greatly from overseas compatriots. Therefore, although the government's assistance to overseas Chinese is minimal, overseas Chinese compatriots are no different from expanding the motherland's sea area, making China no longer confined to the mainland, forming a large maritime country. At this time, as the shackles of Britain and the United States on East Asia are gradually shattered and the Pacific Ocean returns to the hands of the East Asian nations, how to work with Japan and other East Asian nations to clear the sea and build a new foundation for coexistence and co-prosperity is a responsibility we cannot shirk.</p>
<p>In terms of our country's current situation and national needs, the first priority should be the reconstruction of the navy. With China's long coastline and vast sea area, it is undoubtedly necessary to have a strong navy in terms of national defense to consolidate itself and defend East Asia. Moreover, in this new era, to maintain national strength and rational development, it is imperative to use the greatest national strength to manage the navy. Since the late Qing Dynasty, senior figures such as Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong strongly advocated the idea of enriching the country and strengthening the military, and began to build a navy, but due to a lack of leadership, it was completely destroyed in no time. Since the Republic of China, there has been a navy in name, but not in reality. Since the Incident, it has been completely destroyed again. At this time, as the overall situation in the Pacific is clarified and our country has broken away from its semi-colonial status and is moving towards independence and regeneration, a navy should be established as soon as possible, both for national defense and for the defense of East Asia. In light of the painful experiences of the past, emphasis should be placed on the cultivation of new talents, and it should be managed autonomously and unified by the state.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the day of commemorating the sea, we cannot help but feel deeply the urgent need to revitalize the shipbuilding industry today. Building ships is necessary to rebuild the navy, and developing the shipbuilding industry is essential to promote economic development and revitalize all industries. If we take it a step further, we should know that in the victorious development of the liberation wars of the Pacific nations, all exchanges of materials between our country, Japan, and various parts of Nanyang, as well as other assistance in manpower and material resources, depend on the development of the shipbuilding industry. From a military point of view, the current world war is a difficult and long-term war, and the final victory depends not only on the front line, but also on the development and supply of war resources in the rear. The abundance of manpower and material resources in the Greater East Asia region already has the conditions for inevitable victory, but how to make the best use of them depends on the development of the shipbuilding and transportation industries. Therefore, today, China, whether for its own country or for East Asia, must launch a shipbuilding industry, especially in the Central China region, in order to make full use of the inland waterways and coastal navigation, the construction of wooden boats and small transport ships should not be delayed.</p>
<p>In addition, on the day of commemorating the sea, we cannot but think about the improvement of the living conditions of the residents of the six coastal provinces and the revitalization of the marine industry. Among them, the vast majority of residents in the four provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong depend on the ocean for a living. Some cross the sea to engage in industry and commerce in various countries, constituting the most important part of overseas Chinese. Some are engaged in fishing. In addition, there are quite a few people in the six coastal provinces engaged in salt production and shipping. China's wealth has always depended on the coast, and the wealth of the coast has depended on the above-mentioned industries. Since the Incident, the situation has changed, and the coast, which used to be a source of wealth for China, has fallen into poverty due to the disruption of transportation and the decline of trade. This is an undeniable fact. Today, we should work hard on (1) guiding and assisting overseas Chinese, and restoring contact with their hometowns as soon as possible. Special convenience should be given to overseas Chinese remittances, so that their families will not be displaced and die. (2) Reorganize and revitalize the fishing industry and other aquatic industries. The state and financial institutions should assist fishermen and small and medium-sized aquatic product operators in developing their businesses to improve the livelihoods of coastal residents. (3) Improve and develop the salt industry and shipping industry in famous coastal areas. All of these are also necessary steps to develop the national economy.</p>
<p>The Sea Memorial Day is not only for Japan, but also has special significance for China today. In addition to the above-mentioned feelings, we also hope that experts will either devote themselves to research, or discuss together, or propose plans, so that the new China in the 1950s can stand on the Pacific Ocean and be a major force in ensuring its peace and freedom.</p>
<h3>We Need a Pure Shanghai Civic Representative Body</h3>
<p>The day when the Shanghai concessions are formally returned, the most memorable day in Chinese history, is getting closer and closer. How should we welcome this historic day? I believe that all relevant authorities have made full preparations. Today, many people seem to be paying attention to the matter of a Shanghai civic representative body after the return of the concessions. It is also learned that the municipal authorities have long had the intention of establishing a representative body within a considerable period of time after the return of the concessions, which is in line with the demands of all parties and public opinion, which is gratifying. Amidst the eager concern of all parties, we would like to solemnly put forward the following three opinions for study and correction by all sectors:</p>
<p>First, the concessions in China have been the object of resentment for hundreds of years. As for representative bodies, strictly speaking, they have never been seen in the Shanghai concessions. However, in the past, in order to deceive the general Chinese residents, Britain and the United States allowed the establishment of some quasi-organizations. These organizations should naturally not be allowed to exist in the future. If they exist in the future, or are reorganized, the result will be that even if a few people support them, they will be opposed by the majority of citizens. Therefore, we want to clearly express that unless we do not want a representative body, we must gather the strength of all parties to create a pure new representative body.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th: (1) A unit of the Japanese garrison in New Guinea bypassed the enemy's front line and launched a surprise attack on the American landing point and motorcade east of the Ayi River on the night of July 17. The landing facilities and enemy troops in the area were destroyed, and the enemy motorcade was annihilated. The gains are currently being expanded. (2) The Japanese garrison near Munda on New Georgia Island repeatedly repelled attacks by enemy troops with tanks and shelled a fleet of enemy torpedo boats attempting to land on July 17, causing them to collapse.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th that the results of the Japanese naval air force in the Solomon Islands area on July 15, 16, and 17 were as follows: (1) On July 15, the enemy's positions on Rubiana Island were bombed, causing great damage. About 50 enemy planes were engaged in combat, 19 of which were shot down. Ten Japanese planes did not return. (2) On July 16, Vanikoro (one of the Santa Cruz Islands) and Zilake and Guadalcanal were bombed, inflicting considerable damage on enemy ships moored in those locations. (3) On July 17, 167 enemy planes attacking Bougainville Island were engaged in combat, 58 of which were shot down. The Japanese side lost 9 planes.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a Melbourne dispatch, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 18th: (A) Japanese air force units bombed Guadalcanal Island on the nights of July 16 and 17, damaging American personnel and various facilities. (B) Japanese air force units bombed Savo Island.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - The battle between Japanese and American troops on New Georgia Island appears to be intensifying. According to a dispatch from London, Turner, a special correspondent for the London Daily Mail with the American forces, conveyed the spirit of the Japanese army's bravery and skill in battle, roughly stating: "We are relying entirely on the power of metal weapons to defeat Japan, but the Japanese counterattack is extremely fierce. Although the situation is generally stable, a bloody battle unfolds at night. Japanese troops attack American troops hiding in the American campgrounds after sunset, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The Japanese troops hope that the American troops will open fire, so that they can know the location of their positions and throw hand grenades at them. Therefore, the American troops do not dare to open fire and have to lie in ambush in the dark in trenches with mud and water up to their shins to prevent the Japanese troops from attacking. The Japanese troops also attack everywhere in the dense forest to confuse the American troops, and sometimes imitate bird calls to communicate with each other, so that the American troops cannot determine their location. Therefore, the Japanese night attacks have put the American troops in a state of nervous exhaustion."</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Progress on the Central and Southern Sections of the Eastern Front; German Military Circles Claim a New Stage Has Been Entered</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Fuehrer's headquarters announced the war situation on the 18th as follows: "The fighting in the central section of the Eastern Front has expanded to the southern region, and the situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Soviet troops have launched repeated attacks on the Kuban bridgehead and other strongholds, as well as the German hilly positions west of Kubimusks, but have achieved no gains so far. In addition, Soviet troops attempted to break through the German positions on the Donets front with infantry units and tank groups after heavy shelling, but were repelled by a fierce German counterattack."</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) - Military sources declare that the war in the central section of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase since the Soviet troops made repeated attempts to assist. An unprecedented battle is now raging from the Kuban bridgehead to the Donets front, and from the Belgorod area to north of Orel. The Soviet Union has lost 514 tanks and 127 aircraft. It should be noted that this development was expected by the German army. The fighting in Orel and Belgorod is still the center of fierce fighting on the entire line, especially in the northern part of the Orel area, where the fighting is even more tragic. Although the Soviet troops used large tank formations as assistance, they still failed to break through the German front and lost 126 tanks. Both sides used tanks in the Kursk salient and north of Orel. The Soviet side lost another 218 tanks in this battle. Soviet troops intensified their attacks on the German positions in the Mius area. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked in the Donets area with heavy and super-heavy tanks, but still have no effect.</p>

<h3>Severe Flooding in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency) - According to news from Chengdu, Sichuan Province has been experiencing incessant heavy rains since the beginning of this month, resulting in flooding. The loss of crops and livestock casualties in the area is extremely large. In particular, the upstream river water of the Minjiang River has surged, causing the Jin'gang Dam, Feisha Dam, and others to successively breach, and villages and fields have been submerged, making the situation extremely tragic. The Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau is currently working hard to prevent floods and provide relief.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang's Speech at the Soviet People's Congress</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - This is Chairman Wang's speech at the Suzhou People's Congress on July 1. At that time, the recording was incomplete due to a sudden obstruction in the recording machine. Recently, the Chairman personally recorded it in his spare time, and it is specially published in full to comfort the readers. Central News Agency respectfully notes.</p>
<p>When commemorating the second anniversary of the Cleaning Campaign, I am really happy to be able to meet with people from all walks of life at the conference. Since the implementation of the Cleaning Campaign, thanks to the assistance of friendly troops, the cleaning work has been carried out smoothly. At the same time, people from all walks of life, under the leadership of Governor Li, have worked together with one heart and one mind to gradually expand the Cleaning Campaign and achieve today's results. I really can't express my admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>Regarding the review of the Cleaning Campaign, the present, and the future efforts that should be made, I made a speech in the Cleaning Campaign Memorial Hall this morning. You can see it in the newspapers tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, so I won't repeat it here. What I want to talk about now is to talk about the Greater East Asia War from the Cleaning Campaign.</p>
<p>On July 1 of the 30th year, when the Cleaning Campaign began, I once stated that the purpose of the Cleaning Campaign was to establish local peace in order to promote overall peace. This means that if we first achieve security and increase production in a local area, then the model of peace will already exist, and it can naturally be expanded to the whole area. When commemorating the first anniversary of the Cleaning Campaign on July 1 last year, the situation had already progressed a step further. This is because since the Greater East Asia War, the front has been willing to be the eagle dog of Britain and the United States to bite back at the East Asian compatriots. If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first start by destroying Britain and the United States. Therefore, the purpose of the Cleaning Campaign is to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War in one step. I solemnly declared this today. When I walked into the Cleaning Campaign Memorial Hall this morning, I saw what I had stated today last year clearly posted on the wall, which can be used as a reminder for the comrades and comrades in the Cleaning Campaign area not to forget for a moment. I am very comforted and very excited. Since January 9 this year, China has participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the responsibility is even greater. The work of all comrades and comrades, from a close perspective, is the Cleaning Campaign, and from a distant perspective, it is cooperation with the Greater East Asia War. For example, ensuring security, from a close perspective, means that bandits and communists are wiped out in the Cleaning Campaign area, and people can live and work in peace. From a distant perspective, it is to ensure the rear of the Greater East Asia War, so that the soldiers on the front line have no worries. For example, increasing production, from a close perspective, means that the people in the Cleaning Campaign area can increase the quantity of production in agriculture and industry, and cultivate the people's strength. From a distant perspective, the rear of the Greater East Asia War is especially rich and does not worry about lack of resources. This is a necessary condition for obtaining the final victory. Speaking of the Greater East Asia War, this is the natural and righteous thing that all East Asian nations should have. Because our Greater East Asia War, since we are Greater East Asians, we should defend East Asia. There is no doubt about this. There is a saying in China: "A clear conscience fears no accusation." There is also a saying: "Truth makes one fearless." For a hundred years, Britain and the United States have been encircling and attacking East Asia from the Nanyang and East Pacific regions. China has become their semi-colony. Only Japan is fighting against them. This Greater East Asia War is Japan taking the lead in declaring war on Britain and the United States, followed by China, Manchuria, and Thailand participating in unison. From the Philippines in the east to Burma in the west, they have all risen up to participate. Its only purpose is to unite the East Asian nations to defend East Asia and drive out the British and American forces so that they will not come again. In such a Greater East Asia War, there is no East Asian nation that should not be excited. As long as you have a clear conscience, you don't care about success or failure. As long as you are fearless because you are truthful, you will definitely succeed.</p>
<p>Compare us bringing together the East Asian nations to defend East Asia with the Chongqing side's willingness to be the special forces of Britain and the United States to counter East Asia. One is in harmony, one is in opposition, and the truth is obvious. What Chongqing side uses as an excuse is that the war of resistance has been going on for many years, and now being with Britain and the United States can achieve the purpose of the war of resistance. This excuse is not worth refuting. If the purpose of the war of resistance is to save the country, then how can the purpose of saving the country be achieved by being with Britain and the United States? The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, which is undoubtedly true. Even if, as Chongqing side curses, you must know that if the Greater East Asia War fails, it will mean the destruction of East Asia. I ask, how can Chongqing side survive alone? Don't you see India? Why is Mr. Gandhi, at the age of seventy, willing to suffer in prison rather than be tempted by Britain? Because Britain deceived India in the last war, so they will not be deceived again today. Why did Mr. Bose lead the patriots of India to resist Britain? Because he knows that only by participating in the Greater East Asia War and achieving victory can India be liberated. Britain and the United States treat West Asia in this way, and they will not treat East Asia differently. Chongqing side is actually flattering Britain and the United States to liberate China. How absurd is this? Our compatriots deeply know that it is natural for East Asians to defend East Asia, and it is unnatural for East Asians to oppose East Asia. Since justice is clear, I think that except for a very small number of people who have lost their minds, the majority of Chongqing side will eventually come to our side. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Italian Official Newspaper Announced Yesterday that Rome Was Bombed for the First Time; Losses and Casualties Are Being Investigated</h3>
<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - Today, the Italian military headquarters official newspaper announced that the anti-Axis forces had bombed Rome. Details of the losses and the number of casualties are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Army Department announced this morning that US Air Force heavy bombers and medium bomber squadrons in North Africa bombed Rome on the morning of the 16th. Rome is the location of the Vatican Palace of the Holy See, and there are many valuable historical sites in the city. The US Air Force's bombing of this historic Rome is enough to prove that the anti-Axis forces' psychological warfare against Italy has already failed. Therefore, with great difficulty, they have exposed their so-called humanitarianism.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Factories Employ Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the United States is suffering from a shortage of labor, so it is using those who have been wounded in this war and exempted from military service to engage in industrial work. Recently, aircraft factories in Kansas, Texas, and other states in California have employed these wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Sends Personnel to Xi'an to Discuss Methods for Dealing with the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - How the conflict between Chongqing and the Chinese Communists will develop has attracted much attention from all parties. According to reliable information, the vanguard of the Chongqing troops surrounding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Communist Party's base area, attacked the Communist army starting on the 17th of this month, causing heavy casualties to the Communist army. It is now heard that the Communist Party has strictly equipped its troops on the forward positions and immediately asked He Long of our Northwest Military Region for help. Therefore, He Long has also sent troops to reinforce. It is also rumored that the bomber squadron under Mao Bangchu, commander of the Air Force, also dispatched twice on the 17th and flew to the northwest. It is expected that Chongqing will still take this opportunity to attempt to threaten its army from the air.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) According to news received here, the Chongqing "Supreme National Defense Conference" convened a temporary emergency meeting on the 18th after Chiang Kai-shek returned to Chongqing after inspecting the military situation in Chengdu. He Yingqin, Shang Zhen, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Zhirou, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Chen Cheng, and Yang Jie attended to discuss various countermeasures for dealing with the Chongqing-Communist relationship. Afterwards, Shang Yang, Zhou, and others flew to Xi'an based on the policy determined by the meeting and convened a meeting with Zhu Shaoliang, Cai Semei, Hu Zongnan, Yang Aiyuan, and other leaders in the northwest. It seems that a final decision has been made on the specific countermeasures in that area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Survey Mission Returns to Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Economic Survey Mission returned here at 6:00 PM on the 18th. Ogura Masatsune, the head of the mission, said in a speech: "Today, China and Japan have an inseparable relationship under the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese economic community has expressed that it is determined to work hard to supply wartime materials to Japan, which is gratifying. What the Chinese economic community hopes for is that Japan will provide assistance in economy and technology in order to enhance China's productivity. However, in terms of funds, the current situation of Chinese economic institutions has not yet reached the extent of large-scale mobilization of national capital. This requires the cooperation of Japan. However, this cooperation must have the concept of China and Japan being one and respect China's independence. That is, to implement sincere cooperation with the view of China and Japan being one. On the other hand, in economic policies and business operations, we also respect the original will of the Chinese people. The purpose of China's new policy lies in this, and the key to strengthening China's economic strength also lies in this."</p>
<h3>South African Woman Sleeps for Twenty-Seven Years After Being Jilted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - The German news agency quoted a Johannesburg message that a South African woman named Smith Van Sbel died recently after sleeping for twenty-seven years. It is said that when the woman was in her twenties, she fell in love with a young farmer, but the parents of both sides opposed their union, and the man committed suicide. When the woman heard the bad news, she suffered from hysteria (a type of mental illness) and fell into a coma. She only woke up once in the middle, but fell back into a coma shortly after.</p>
<h3>Local Governors' Conference Held Yesterday; Many Long-Standing Issues Resolved</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – To concentrate the total power of one hundred million citizens and to promote unified decisive measures between the central government and local areas, the Japanese government convened a local governors' conference at the Prime Minister's official residence from 8:00 AM on the 19th. Attendees included Governor Otatsu of Tokyo, Governor Saka of Hokkaido, Director-General Otsu of Karafuto, governors of the other two prefectures and forty-three counties, Police Superintendent Usuda, Military Police Commander Kato, and other related personnel. Representing the government were Prime Minister Tojo, Home Minister Ando, the entire cabinet, Chief Secretary Hoshino, the four chief cabinet secretaries, and other related personnel. First, Prime Minister Tojo expressed the Japanese government's determination to address the current critical situation. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu discussed the current international situation. At 9:40 AM, Home Minister Ando and the attending governors visited the Imperial Palace to pay their respects to the Emperor. After returning, they reconvened at the Prime Minister's official residence, commencing discussions at 10:30 AM. Initially, Agriculture Minister Yamazaki explained measures for increasing food production, followed by the governors frankly presenting their views on local conditions. They also discussed and established a unified central-local policy for increasing food production under the decisive battle situation. After a short midday break, discussions resumed at 1:00 PM. Home Minister Ando elaborated on plans to expand productivity, including streamlining enterprises, after which they began discussing concrete measures for expanding productivity. At 3:00 PM, discussions focused on current issues such as transportation, labor, and strengthening war capabilities, with participating cabinet ministers taking the lead. At 5:30 PM, the venue moved to the Home Minister's official residence, where discussions were held on internal administrative matters such as the operational guidelines of the Local Administration Council. The conference then concluded. This Japanese local governors' conference lasted only one day. However, despite the short duration, it successfully resolved all the decisive measures passed by the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet and important long-standing issues concerning the operation of the Local Administration Council. Concrete measures for increasing food production and streamlining enterprises were also decided upon satisfactorily. Therefore, the significance of this conference is truly substantial.</p>
<p>Tojo Prime Minister's Address</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – At the opening of the Extraordinary Japanese Local Governors' Conference on the 19th, Prime Minister Tojo delivered an address. The main points are as follows: The current global war situation is approaching the autumn of decisive battles, and the situation is extremely tense. Various difficulties are unavoidable. The enemy faces even greater difficulties than we do. The key to overcoming these difficulties lies in fighting bravely and striving to enhance war capabilities, only then can victory be achieved. At this time, what our country should strive for most in guiding the war is to actively expand war results, strengthen war capabilities, and strengthen cooperation with allied nations to exert their strength. This will allow us to strike a painful blow against the stubborn enemy. Our heroic soldiers, based on this key principle, will make good use of their strategic advantages to eliminate the enemy's counter-offensive capabilities. We will also strengthen the defensive preparations of important strongholds and actively strengthen cooperation, thereby uniting the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia and their total power, rapidly turning the resources within the Co-Prosperity Sphere into war capabilities, and fulfilling the needs of the war. I have previously visited China and Manchuria, and the Philippines. Now I have also visited Thailand and inspected various southern regions. I have witnessed that the peoples in all the places our troops have reached sincerely wish to cooperate, which is deeply gratifying. I have also seen that the vast resources of Greater East Asia are increasingly being transformed into war capabilities, which makes my belief that Greater East Asia will surely win the war and that the construction of Greater East Asia will surely succeed even more unwavering. To accommodate the sincere cooperation of various countries and peoples in Greater East Asia, the Empire will further adopt various friendly measures and actively proceed to promote the welfare of East Asia, so that East Asia can unite as one and jointly build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, we must continue to strive, permanently based on the spirit of morality, so that all countries and peoples in Greater East Asia can escape the shackles of Britain and the United States and be liberated.</p>
<p>Enhancing War Capabilities</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo then spoke about the issue of enhancing war capabilities, stating that the Japanese government, based on the two major objectives of ensuring the stability of national life during wartime and rapidly enhancing war capabilities, is implementing various domestic policies. Currently, it is focusing on rapidly enhancing war capabilities by increasing the self-sufficiency of major food supplies and streamlining enterprises, and is swiftly implementing strong governance. However, given the current war situation, it is necessary to proceed extremely quickly and decisively. Streamlining enterprises to enhance war capabilities has been implemented successively since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War until today. However, with the advancement of the war situation, the streamlining that has been carried out repeatedly in the past must be expanded and strengthened more rapidly. The purpose of this streamlining of enterprises is entirely focused on increasing war capabilities and making practical and organic use of them. Japan's entire economic and war capabilities, not to mention resources, power, and transportation capabilities, are all concentrated on enhancing war capabilities. Regardless of gender, age, or profession, everyone should be placed in appropriate positions and participate in increasing war capabilities, eliminating all unnecessary expenses and contributing various special effects to enhance war capabilities. Therefore, this measure is truly a landmark innovation, enabling one hundred million citizens to contribute to enhancing war capabilities. At the same time, streamlining facilities, machinery, and equipment for use in the industrial decisive battle system to enhance war capabilities means that although the war duties of one hundred million citizens are different, they are actually all participating in enhancing war capabilities and contributing to the war effort. Prime Minister Tojo also gave detailed instructions on establishing local administrative councils to form a new local system, which deeply moved all attendees.</p>
<h3>English Literature and the Rise and Fall of England (1)</h3>
<p>No English scholar talks about female learning in the Victorian era. But from a historical perspective, I would like to briefly examine how literature is related to the rise and fall of England. I certainly do not have specialized knowledge of England. However, from the early to mid-Victorian era, even if it cannot be said to be the highest peak of English literature, it can at least be said to be a magnificent era! Compared with the literature of the Elizabethan era, its liveliness and splendor are no less. In the realm of novels, there are Thackeray and Dickens; in poetry, there are Tennyson and Browning; in prose, there are Macaulay and Carlyle. In any aspect of literature, great masters and famous figures emerged one after another, too many to list individually. And their literature, as we see it, is extremely sound, with signs of national prosperity, and also possesses its stimulating and guiding power.</p>
<p>Macaulay Becomes Famous Overnight</p>
<p>Let me briefly describe one or two examples below. For example, Macaulay, because he was quite famous during his lifetime, many people pointed out his shortcomings after his death. Nevertheless, his essays, when read today, are indeed the highest form of self-study material. Like his history, what he did, in that period, no one else could have done. Macaulay was not a philosopher, but a man of common sense. Not a traitor, but a loyal subject. Not someone who walked ahead of the times, but someone who followed the times. However, he was a passionate party member. He was always a brave general of the Whig Party (the predecessor of the Conservative Party), wielding his flexible skills in grammar and in the political arena. Leaving aside his history, looking at all his works, the exaggerations are excessive, the shades of color are too strong, and the contrast between light and darkness is too great, which often invites criticism. However, someone like him, with a healthy literary conscience and a keen sense of feeling, is hard to come by.</p>
<h3>Further Remarks on English Tragedy, Part 4 – Tokutomi Iichiro</h3>
<p>When he wanted to narrate an event, he tirelessly delved into hundreds of volumes of reference books. When he recorded an event, he personally went to the site to inspect it, regardless of the distance. His articles appear like a grand military parade in Germany, a very solemn and majestic spectacle. However, this was by no means accomplished in one fell swoop. Anyone who saw his original manuscripts in the British Museum was amazed by his painstaking efforts in polishing each word and sentence. From the time when his "Essay on Milton" was published in his twenties, astounding the world overnight, to the time when he died in his sixties, failing to complete the original manuscript of his history, he remained consistent throughout, with almost no change. In other words, although there was no progress, there was also no regression. As Bagehot said, "He is who he was yesterday, and who he was yesterday is who he is today." He used a rather harsh pen to describe Churchill, the ancestor of the Duke of Marlborough. Therefore, the current British Prime Minister Churchill, to redress the perceived injustice, put all his effort into writing "The Biography of the Duke of Marlborough." However, most people do not defend Churchill, but instead further the indictment of Macaulay; the saying "Dead Macaulay drives living Churchill" refers to this matter.</p>
<p>Translated from the Second Editorial of the First Edition</p>
<p>According to the report on July 17th, the ambassador stationed in Manchuria is in Shanghai and is preparing a plan to reorganize the Taxpayers' Association. The general idea is: "Now that the concessions have been recovered, there is actually nothing to do. However, it would be a great pity to close the association. It is proposed to change the name, reorganize it, preserve its glorious history, and create new undertakings. This is a win-win solution." After careful study, we disagree from a practical standpoint. We know that many diligent and fair people participated in the Taxpayers' Association in the past, but its nature and mission were products of the concessions, existing to meet the needs of the concessions. Now that the concessions no longer exist, the new construction of Shanghai in the future cannot be fulfilled by the old Taxpayers' Association as a people's voice. Therefore, from a practical need, the Taxpayers' Association should be abolished with the handover of the concessions. Since there is nothing to do, it should not be forcibly reorganized because it would be a pity to close it down. Furthermore, the nature of the association makes it impossible to evolve into a future civic representative body.</p>
<p>Secondly, the selection of candidates for the public opinion mechanism must be approached with extreme caution. In order to ensure that the true public opinion mechanism plays its role in the future and serves as the voice of the citizens, the candidates for the public opinion mechanism, regardless of their class, party affiliation, or professional relationship, must truly come from the people, and especially center on fair people in the business community who are trusted by the citizens. It is absolutely not allowed to accommodate elements who come for the benefit of a party, faction, or small group. As for current government officials, they should also recuse themselves and not participate. This is the basic principle of a genuine public opinion mechanism. If this principle is violated even slightly, it loses the true meaning of a public opinion mechanism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the early establishment of a public opinion mechanism is eagerly awaited by all sectors. However, the date of the official recovery of the concessions is approaching, and it is not practically feasible to establish a perfect public opinion mechanism in the short term. We should also understand that the authorities are currently focused on administrative arrangements and cannot proceed simultaneously. We should know that the establishment of a public opinion mechanism is only a matter of time, and we can wait a month or two in haste to allow sufficient time for preparation. At the same time, this is a major event related to the rights and interests of citizens and the future of the country and society. Therefore, we hope that advanced people from all sectors of society will study and discuss it, and express their opinions to the relevant authorities or in newspapers, to gather wisdom and achieve success.</p>
<p>For the sake of the future of the new Shanghai, for the sake of the glory of this future page of history, we cannot help but speak frankly. We believe that virtuous gentlemen will understand, and we especially hope for corrections from all sides.</p>

<h3>Joint Venture Company's Rice Arrives; Awaiting Distribution and Sale; Most of the Rice Arriving in Shanghai is National Rice</h3>
<p>Regarding the local food problem, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, who told a Commercial News Agency reporter yesterday, the first batch of 15,000 tons of rice has mostly arrived in Shanghai. The company's work situation in recent days has been very busy, because batches of rice are sent to Shanghai daily by special personnel dispatched from various places. More than a hundred workers are working continuously to load the rice into warehouses. Most of the rice is stored in the Zhejiang Xingye Bank warehouse, and it will be distributed to the Public Works Department, the French Municipal Council, and the Municipal Grain Bureau as soon as the authorities instruct. The rice arriving in Shanghai can be divided into two types. One type is first-class national rice (i.e., Du rice), accounting for about 70% of the total, and the remaining 30% is Xian rice, coming from Yangzhou and other places. The rice purchased by the joint venture company does not include broken rice or brown rice. Today, all rice shops are closed for one day regarding the 41st-term household rice for the two concessions, and tomorrow afternoon is the deadline. The quantity of household rice for the next term is of great concern to the city's five million residents. However, the quantity and price must be decided by the Grain Commission authorities. Well-informed sources say that, judging from the current situation, the household rice for the next term is expected to be restored to two Sheng, but this still depends on the Public Works Department's announcement.</p>
<h3>Material Survey; City Divided into Three Zones; Commercial Control Committee Unrelated to Survey Work; Two Additional Survey Officers Hired in the French Concession</h3>
<p>After the Material Survey Committee appointed twelve people designated by relevant Shanghai agencies as survey officers for the committee's survey group, it began survey work last Tuesday. The city is divided into three major zones, comprising thirty survey teams. All 160 surveyors have gone out to conduct surveys. The preliminary survey of cotton yarn and cloth in various warehouses has been completed based on the quantities registered by the Economic Bureau and the Public Works Department, and detailed review is currently underway. To strengthen the survey of hoarding in the French Concession area, the committee has specially hired Shen Duyang, deputy director of the French Concession Police and director of the Price Management Office, and Inspector Bao Lefan as survey officers. They arrived at the meeting yesterday and jointly conducted survey work with the other survey officers.</p>
<h3>Measures of the Commercial Control Committee</h3>
<p>Recently, all sectors have paid close attention to the material survey in the city. Rumor has it that the committee was assigned to be handled by personnel dispatched by the Commercial Control Committee. To clarify the truth, the Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed the National Commercial Control Committee yesterday to inquire about everything in detail. According to the person in charge of the committee, "When the committee held cotton yarn and cloth registration in March, it coincided with the government's investigation of speculation and hoarding. The Ministry of Industry ordered the committee to handle the investigation. Because the deadline for cotton yarn and cloth registration was pressing, some merchants may not have had time to comply. Therefore, the committee requested and was approved by the Ministry of Industry to conduct a supplementary registration once. Not long after the supplementary registration was completed, the government established the Material Survey Committee. To unify the authority, all previous investigation work was transferred to the Material Survey Committee for management with the approval of the committee. Therefore, since its establishment in March, the committee has never dispatched personnel to investigate any shops. The Material Survey Committee is currently conducting survey work, and the committee has carefully selected personnel from various agencies to handle it. When conducting the survey, there must be formal credentials. Now that there are rumors of people falsely using the committee's name, it is inevitable that unscrupulous people will swindle and deceive. Merchants are urged not to be fooled and to report to the police at any time and notify the committee so that it can be strictly investigated and dealt with to prevent fraud." It is also reported that the committee strictly follows the regulations and procedures when handling the approval of material moving in and out through the Ministry of Industry's Material Control Office, and the committee always urges all colleagues to adhere to the four words of "fairness and impartiality" and to be sincere and diligent. At the same time, members are encouraged to practice self-discipline. If there are any violations of laws or regulations, regardless of whether they are committee staff, it is hoped that they will be reported to the committee at any time. In addition to keeping the names of the reporters strictly confidential, the committee will immediately conduct a thorough investigation and severe punishment to deter troublemakers."</p>
<h3>Fifth-Term Household Sugar; Public Sale Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperation and Sales Office has presented the fifth term of household sugar to the military union for approval, and the allocation has been completed. It is scheduled to start public sale simultaneously in all districts of the city from tomorrow (the 21st) at type-A retail sugar shops. The method is the same as in previous terms. Each certificate can purchase half a catty of white sugar, costing 2.35 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates (excluding the cost of packaging). However, the French Concession must add an additional 2 Li in sales tax. The total price is calculated as 5.05 yuan for every 100 grams. The sale of household sugar for this term ends on the 31st of this month, and it will be invalid after the deadline.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperation and Sales Office will continue to allocate special sugar needed for business operations to various industries on a regular basis. However, management is quite strict, and it is only allowed to be used for business operations and absolutely not allowed to be sold privately for profit. To prevent unscrupulous merchants from violating the regulations, the office has dispatched personnel to investigate various businesses to pay attention to whether the allocation and the required quantity are consistent. If the above situation is found, the allocation will be stopped immediately.</p>
<h3>Deceased Self-Defense Corps Members; Held Baojia Funeral; Compensation for Families</h3>
<p>The Fang Jiujiu Jewelry Store at 479 Nanjing Road was robbed at 12:30 PM on the 18th. Shen Heqing, the head of the 20th Jia Self-Defense Corps, West Bao, First Lianbao, Lao Guan District, and Jiang E, were shot and killed by the robber Huang Cifu while bravely pursuing them. The perpetrators have been arrested and are being handled. As for the two deceased corps members, the Baoba organized a funeral committee to take charge of the aftermath. The remains were sent to Anle Funeral Home. The encoffining is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow. The Baoba Guidance Department and other agencies will hold a "Baoba funeral." At that time, Baoba authorities from various districts of the city will send personnel to pay tribute and for the funeral procession. They will pass by Nanjing Road to pay tribute at the scene of the incident, and at the same time request the authorities to compensate and punish the perpetrators. The Baoba Guidance Department has expressed that it will generously compensate the families of the deceased and will hold a memorial service to pay tribute to the heroic souls. As for the rather desolate situation of the two deceased self-defense corps, Wu Shaoxian, the guidance committee member of the Public Concession Baoba, felt that the families were very pitiful and had lost their means of support. Therefore, it was necessary to provide compensation. He has raised 2,823 yuan from his friends and handed it over to the Baoba Guidance Department to be given to the families of Shen and Jiang.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Federation Promotes; Thrift Movement Week; The Ninth of Each Month is Thrift Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Federation, in view of the fact that modern wartime countries all regard saving materials as an important means of seeking final victory, and that the atmosphere of extravagance in Shanghai is particularly strong, and the waste of materials is particularly great, which not only affects wartime material resources, but also stimulates price increases, in order to correct social attitudes, initiated the thrift movement. After the Federation's board of directors meeting, a special committee for the thrift movement was set up to promote concrete measures. After two meetings, the first step of the work plan was determined, and the implementation method was also approved by the board of directors. The main points of the decision are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Expand Promotion Week</p>
<p>1.  It is scheduled to hold an expanded promotion week for the thrift movement from today (the 20th) to the 26th, with various newspapers expanding publicity. 2. It is stipulated that the ninth of each month is Thrift Day, with no drinking and no banquets. Various newspapers will publish thrift rules on this day. The special committee for the thrift movement has made six resolutions: 1. Solicit concrete measures for the simple movement from people in the society. 2. If someone suffers disrespect due to practicing the simple movement, they can inform the Federation by letter so that it can be exposed and corrected. 3. Each newspaper should publish with the good intention of promoting thrift. 4. Hold simple movement lecture meetings. 5. Compose a thrift song.</p>
<p>The Federation also adopted six creeds of the thrift movement, hoping to practice the creeds together as follows:</p>
<h3>Six Creeds of the Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>1.  Wear old clothes and old shoes as much as possible, and do not make new clothes unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>2.  Make new clothes as simple, economical, and plain as possible.</p>
<p>3.  In summer, men's Chinese clothes can not wear long gowns, and Western clothes can not wear jackets, it is okay to wear shorts.</p>
<p>4.  Do not be extravagant in weddings and funerals, do not host banquets, and gifts should be simple and practical.</p>
<p>5.  For necessary wine and banquet occasions, designate the lowest price banquet in the restaurant.</p>
<p>6.  It is stipulated that the ninth of each month is Thrift Day, with no drinking and no banquets.</p>
<h3>Thrift Movement Slogans and Taglines are Divided into</h3>
<p>(1) General, (2) Clothing, (3) Food. Our newspaper has decided to publish them six times this week, each type published for two days, so that the public can effectively implement them. Today and tomorrow, we will first publish the general ones as follows:</p>
<p>Practice thrift, build a family and serve the country.</p>
<p>Practicing the New National Movement starts with thrift.</p>
<p>Do not waste, do not be extravagant.</p>
<p>Thrift is a good behavior that loves oneself, loves others, loves the family, and loves the country.</p>
<p>Waste is a bad habit that harms oneself, harms others, harms the family, and harms the country.</p>
<p>To demand the liberation of East Asia and national freedom, we must first practice thrift.</p>
<p>Those who are thrifty are respected by everyone.</p>
<p>Those who are wasteful are looked down upon by everyone.</p>
<p>Saving materials is a good way to lower prices.</p>
<p>The reason for high prices is hoarding and smuggling, and waste and extravagance.</p>

<p>Those who waste materials are as hateful as hoarding merchants.</p>
<p>Those who waste materials are the enemy of the public.</p>

There were more than 300 students last semester, and the entrance examination this year will be held simultaneously at the East and West schools on August 21.</p>
<h3>Large Transactions of Coal; Can be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>To replenish their reserves, the city's major coal companies have returned to various coal-producing areas in the country to purchase large quantities of goods. It is learned that in addition to the coal that has already been transacted and is being shipped to this place to meet market demand, a large quantity of coal has recently been traded. This fuel is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month. At that time, after the relevant authorities designate the standards and price limits, it will be put on the market for purchase and sale, and the price will be limited.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Will Establish; Large-Scale Municipal Pawnshop; Adapt to the Needs of the Common People</h3>
<p>In order to curb the general practice of usurious exploitation of the poor's temporary financial needs in the district, the municipal authorities, in addition to ordering the municipal police to close down illegal pledges, have also established a large-scale municipal pawnshop to regulate finance. It is learned that the capital is more than one million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, and it has been decided to find suitable houses near Simen Fangbang Road in Nanshi. The work is currently in progress.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>The Nameless Hero Who Doesn't Eat Grain or Carry a Gun</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported a robbery at Fang Jiu Silver Shop, during which Self-Defense Corps member Shen Heqing bravely intervened to stop the robbers, resulting in his being shot and killed, a heroic sacrifice. This incident demonstrates the immense power and effectiveness of Self-Defense Corps members in maintaining social order and local security. Shen Heqing's sacrifice can strengthen the public's trust in the Self-Defense Corps and exemplifies the citizens' ability to govern themselves and their dedication to service. Shen Heqing is praised by all the citizens of the city. Though dead, he lives on. The elegiac couplet presented by Mr. Zhang Yipeng: "A great role model who can be loyal and sacrifice himself. He is truly a nameless hero who doesn't eat grain or carry a gun." "He embraced them and helped to capture the bandits, reclaiming the forefront of the concessions. His spirit will never die, inspiring the rise of the people's forces." This truly reflects the common sentiment of all Shanghai citizens! We hope that every member of the Self-Defense Corps possesses the spirit of a nameless hero.</p>
<h3>Expired Epidemic Prevention Certificate Requires Re-Injection</h3>
<p>The health authorities in the city and the two concessions, Hongkou District, implemented citywide epidemic prevention injections starting in April. Almost three months have passed, and according to regulations, re-injections should be administered after three months to ensure the absolute health of the citizens and fundamentally eliminate the occurrence of epidemics. It is now learned that the responsible parties have actively begun the injection work, inspecting epidemic prevention certificates and administering injections to those with expired certificates, issuing new certificates. Starting August 1st, there will be a comprehensive inspection of the possession and renewal of these certificates. Those who have not renewed will be immediately injected with the epidemic prevention vaccine. At that time, comprehensive inspections will be conducted on land and water vehicles.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the New Public Benevolent Hall: The Grand View Garden for the Helpless – The Poor, Sick, Elderly, Young, and Disabled Immersed in the Light of Charity</h3>
<p>On a square of over 120 acres on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, Mr. Lu Bohong donated funds to build this "Grand View Garden" for the poor, sick, elderly, young, and disabled as early as the first year of the Republic. Here, there are gardens with a foreign flair, as well as flowerbeds and vegetable plots in the native style. Here, there are modern schools, hospitals, chapels, and simple workshops, forming a new society.</p>
<p>In this new society – the New Public Benevolent Hall – the person in charge, Mr. Li Yucong, is actually burying himself in hard work and struggling to manage the institution. The nuns and male and female workers of the Catholic Order are also dedicated. Most of the nuns come from European and American countries, and there are also many of Chinese origin. They have all received quite advanced education. Under the inspiration of Catholic doctrine, they have abandoned high-level enjoyment to serve the suffering and helpless. Their so-called undertakings can be generally divided into: (1) Nursing Home, (2) Disability Home, (3) Orphanage, (4) Charity Hospital. In addition, there are also accommodations for widows and widowers and free schools. Over the years, the total number of people served has been no less than ten thousand. Recently (June of the 32nd year of the Republic), the Nursing Home housed 202 people, the Disability Department 136 people, the [illegible] Department 156 people, the Orphanage 239 people, the Kindergarten 194 people, Refugees 54 people, and there were 57 staff and hired workers, for a total of 1,038 people. In addition, there are about 120 day students in the free school, and the number of people receiving daily medical care and medicine and the number of abandoned babies taken in at the door is also considerable. Among the charitable organizations in Shanghai, this should be considered the largest in scale.</p>
<p>The Nursery Department Filled with Laughter</p>
<p>The Nursery Department is located in several foreign-style buildings in the cultural garden, with not small gardens and playgrounds. Most of the babies are sent by impoverished compatriots. According to the "head nun" who led the tour, although funding is difficult, they will never refuse to take in abandoned babies. After examination, the sick are sent to the infant disease department. Because of the special needs of the infants, they still cannot collect enough milk powder and the like. When the children see the head nun, they greet her warmly, and the nun also smiles and touches them, allowing the reporter to hold them. The whole yard is filled with laughter. In this day and age, who doesn't envy this lively group of lucky children? It is said that many have grown up here and have been helped with marriage.</p>
<p>Orphans on the Right Path</p>
<p>The orphans in the New Public Benevolent Hall, in addition to a small portion sent from outside, have all grown up in the nursery. Most of them are girls. The youngest are assigned to the kindergarten, where boys and girls live together, wearing uniform uniforms and rubber shoes, playing lively games. When visitors come, they are led by the head nun and teachers to stand up and greet them. The older ones are about at the elementary school level and are taught in graded classes. They cherish public property. For example, used composition books are turned over, re-stitched, and rewritten. Inside, there is a little girl named Yunzhen, who is the only survivor among the three hundred orphaned children who were in danger when the army retreated west in the 26th year of the Republic. When the nun spoke about the story of rescuing the orphans at the iron gate at the time, tears flickered in the little eyes of the girl Yunzhen. Orphans at the higher elementary school level are educated separately by gender, and some are even sent outside the hall to study. In the past, male orphans were kept until they were able to establish a family and support themselves, and then they would leave the hall. Now, due to insufficient funding, they are only raised until the age of sixteen, and then they are introduced to industry and commerce to learn a craft, relying on them to support themselves. The older orphans have considerable knowledge and can understand the difficulties of the hall, so their food and clothing are coarser than those of the younger ones. When female orphans reach a suitable age, they are helped to choose a husband.</p>
<p>The Nursing Home Speaking Generously of the Past</p>
<p>The nursing home is divided into male and female sections, with a regular number of about one hundred residents each. All are over sixty years old, some sent by the Charity Association, and some who seek care on their own. Among them are many elderly people with glorious experiences. In the women's section, the reporter saw an 81-year-old woman, Zeng Laotai, who is said to be the wife of a former Qing Dynasty Daotai. When asked by the reporter, she just shook her head and sighed, "Now, how can I say it well?" She had traveled with her husband to various places and can still speak the dialects of various regions. In the men's section, an 82-year-old man from Hangzhou, Zhou Zhudie, spoke passionately about his past life of fighting wars, and was also reduced to poverty and ruin because of the war. In addition to those outdated old ladies and gentlemen, most of the people in the nursing home are of peasant and worker origin. There are a few who seem to have relatives in far-flung places with whom they have been out of contact for a long time. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Are "Shanghai People the New Jews"?</h3>
<p>Recently, there was an interesting Q&amp;A session between Mr. Shimoda Masami, Editor-in-Chief of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, and Zhou [illegible] Hai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, in Beijing. One passage is particularly worth recording for public viewing:</p>
<p>Mr. Shimoda asked: "I have been in Shanghai for two years and can feel that Shanghai's... the state of decisive battle has not yet fully met expectations. The free economic thought of America and Britain still remains. China after the war... must implement a highly controlled economy. Since the new economic policy, it is said that Shanghai economic leaders have participated in cooperation..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou replied: "Shanghai citizens have deeply resented the governments of Britain and America for a hundred years... At the time of the Northern Expedition... the Chinese in Shanghai also opposed the National Government. Therefore, the non-cooperative attitude of the Chinese in Shanghai towards the National Government did not begin today. In short, the Chinese in Shanghai are a kind of new Jews who have lost the concept of a motherland. In order to conquer these [illegible] Chinese in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek did not hesitate to organize the Blue Shirts Society, using assassination to turn them around. I believe that in explaining the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation, it is also appropriate to adopt means, but this so-called force does not refer to... assassination, but political force and legal force. If there are violations of the controlled economy, they should be punished by legal force."</p>
<p>Shanghai people – especially Shanghai businessmen – will feel terrified after reading the above passage from Mr. Zhou! No one wants the nickname "New Jews." We hope that Shanghai businessmen, if there are shortcomings, will correct them; if not, will strive harder, and let us become "New Chinese" of the era!</p>
<h3>Lower-Level Organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee – Japanese Flour Milling Association Established</h3>
<p>The Japanese Flour Milling Association, a lower-level organization of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, held its inaugural meeting at 5:00 PM the other day. Attendees included five representatives from Shanghai, four from Suzhou, three from Wuxi, three from Changzhou, two from Zhenjiang, two from Wuhu, and one from Nanjing. In addition to passing the charter, the responsible personnel of the association were elected as follows:</p>
<p>(Responsible Personnel) Chairman: Sanxing Flour Company, Vice Chairman: Mitsui &amp; Co., Mitsubishi Corporation, Chairman of the Board: Inoue Yasutada, Vice Chairman of the Board: Imajo Tatsuo, Nagata Hiroshi, Managing Director: Tomiie Masaru, Directors: Dan Yu Flour, Dongfu Flour, Moriki Sangyo, Arai Yoko, Datong Yoko.</p>
<p>(Main Charter) A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the main charter of the association as follows: (1) This association, under the guidance of the Commercial Control Council, will assist in the implementation of economic policies to ensure the smooth manufacture and production of wheat and by-products. (2) The obligations of this association are as follows: 1. Bearing expenses, 2. Complying with regulations, 3. Reporting on the production and trade of miscellaneous grains. (3) The chairman will manage the association's business, the vice chairman will act as the chairman's agent in the era of the chairman's system, and the chairman of the board will be responsible for liaison matters. There are three departments attached: 1. Flour Mills, 2. Wheat Procurement Operators, 3. Operators of wheat flour by-product allocation, transportation, and transfer.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Scarce and Popular</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of adjusted price limits for woolen fabrics last week, the prices of various thick, thin, coarse, fine, and shiny wool products have risen. Especially the shiny fabrics woven from fine wool and the grass-green autumn and winter woolen fabrics have seen peak prices. Due to the shortage of inventory in the warehouse, merchants are scrambling for supply, causing the trend to be exceptionally popular.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea – Trading Becomes Active</h3>
<p>Tea merchants in this street, in view of the insufficient inventory and the revival of interest due to the weather turning hot, have agreed on the long-stagnant Qimen black tea. Yesterday, the supply and demand sides reached an agreement, with Datongchang Tea Company absorbing about 600 boxes of the above-mentioned variety. It is said that the price is over 16 Customs Outside. The Qing[illegible] Tea House, appointed by the Charity Association, sold the tea. At the same time, negotiations are still ongoing with the suppliers. If an agreement can be reached, there may be further wholesale sales within days. As for red and green tea cores, since they were absorbed by Xinyao Trading Company for transport to Japan, the inventory in the market has been exhausted. The company still has demand, but the suppliers are still firm in their intention to sell, so the supply is extremely scarce, causing buyers to be unable to purchase goods. According to people in the industry, Datongchang Tea Company in this city recently procured a large batch of new red and green tea, amounting to more than 4,000 dan, from the producing areas. Most of them are stir-fried green tea and baked green tea. They are currently trying to ship them to Shanghai, which should slightly increase the inventory in the market.</p>
<h3>The Banking and Money Industry in the Past Six Months – From Prosperity to Decline</h3>
<p>According to estimates from financial circles, the total number of newly opened banks from January to June of this year was 51, and the number of money shops was 36. March saw the most, with 16 new banks and 9 money shops. After March, the number decreased month by month. In June, only 3 new banks and 2 money shops were opened. In the current month, there are only reorganized and merged banks and money shops.</p>
<h3>Trends in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks entered a consolidation phase, initially rising and then falling. The market firmed up at noon. Despite the sharp fall in gold prices, it was difficult to shake investor confidence. Sell orders for high prices and to realize profits temporarily suppressed the market, but new and old investors absorbed and raised the prices when they fell slightly. Trading has become increasingly thin. Only small-denomination stocks are favored by buyers, with the largest gains in the department store sector, particularly Wing On and China National Goods Company. The upward trend of Sincere has slowed. Underwear stands out in Customs Outside, and Jingfu shirts and socks have steadily risen in Customs Outside. The peak of Jinglun has been seen repeatedly. In the textile industry, Dasheng First, Third and Second Factories and Wuhe Weaving have risen sharply. Wing On Textile and Youzhong have reached a key level. Xinhe, Rongfeng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving, Guobai, Guoguang, [illegible], Xinfeng and other stocks all showed signs of demand and supply. In the pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa and Jianya have both surpassed Customs Outside, and Xinyi has been particularly strong. Minyi, Zhongxi, and Star Perfume have all been firm. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Yongdian and Huashang Electric have stopped rising and stabilized. Hanyeping has suddenly been raised by investors, and Da Zhonghua Huorong continues to advance. The Nanyang Tobacco Company is the only one that has seen a decline and entered Customs. The buying interest in the cultural industry has subsided. Shijie is firm, Zhonghua is still at Customs, Shangwu has been reduced, and Yongxiang Printing is popular. Jiuan Industry is making another attempt to approach a key level. Guohua and China Investment are particularly strong in the market. Tongyi Trust is priced higher day by day. Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate have both made progress. Kangyuan Confectionery is continuing to advance, and Xinya, Jianye, Zhongxing, Sixth Pharmaceutical, and Huafeng Enamel have all risen in unison. The transaction price of Defeng Knitting has exceeded the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the Shanghai silver industry still quoted the limited price for jewelry gold at New Partnership Jewelry per tael, and the handling fee also remained the same. However, there were no loans on the market, and there was no market for both the industry and outside the industry. The price has fallen back and has entered the Customs level. The price of fine silver has risen slightly and is approaching the 100 level.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The trading of unified government bonds was very light this morning. Only two types were traded, and the rest were not available. The price has fallen by 2-3 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Due to the authorities' strict crackdown on the black market, there is a phenomenon of an industry-only market. There were only price calls, and no transactions were concluded. As for the trend, it continues to be soft. All cloths have fallen compared to last Saturday. The price of dragon head fine cloth has retreated near the key level. Sijunzi Serge has fallen by several yuan. There were no transactions for Peach Blossom Ladies' cloth. Sanyang Serge [illegible] is also weak.</p>

<p>Northern Goods: Recently, the people's hearts in the Northern Goods market are still upward due to the [illegible] water overgrowth, but actual demand has decreased and trading has been slow.</p>

<p>Commemorative Issue for Sea-Related Holidays</p>
<h3>Japan's Maritime Spirit</h3>
<p>— Mian</p>
<p>The invigoration of national spirit and the development of a nation are closely related, and the sea has a significant impact on the invigoration of national spirit. The sea is a crucible for forging the national spirit. Ancient Greek philosophers said, "The most fluid thing in the world is water." On this ever-changing sea, with raging winds and turbulent waves, sailing through it is unimaginably perilous. However, all these difficulties must be overcome. Thus, it cultivates a spirit of composure, bravery, and agility – this is the maritime spirit.</p>
<p>The continental spirit stands in opposition to the maritime spirit. This is due to the environment and way of life. The continental spirit is simple, self-centered, and competitive. While individuals may possess bravery, they lack the ability to unite. For example, the English are a maritime nation, while the French are a continental nation. And the ironclad facts before us are enough to prove the merits and demerits of both.</p>
<p>During this Greater East Asia War, the driving force behind Japan's rapid progress is the Japanese spirit, which is fully manifested in daily life. The Japanese spirit, from the distant ancestors who entrusted their fate to a small boat, conquering the vast waves and spending their lives at sea, is not something achieved overnight. This spirit is not only influenced by the sea, but also by the spirit of unity among all crew members on board, following the captain's lead and advancing and retreating together, which forms the foundation of the Japanese spirit. For example, the entire Japanese nation is a ship, the Emperor is the captain, and the 100 million citizens are sailors. This is the full picture of Japan, the origin of the totalitarian ideology of the Japanese spirit. Continental nations, on the other hand, develop a completely opposite materialistic individualistic ideology because they are subject to a controlled environment. The cultivation of this maritime spirit benefits from the implementation of maritime education and sea training. Without these, it is impossible to invigorate the maritime spirit. Speaking of training, it must start with children. Children's love of water is innate. Therefore, when guiding water training, one should first understand their psychology, make them close to water, make them love the sea, admire the sea, and further study the sea. Thus, the maritime spirit is deeply imprinted in their young and indelible minds.</p>
<p>Organization is necessary not only for the convenience of guidance but also for achieving practical results. With organization, there is power. We don't need to explain this simple truth in detail. In short, when an individual joins an organization, they have responsibility. Whether it's children or women, as long as they have a sense of responsibility, it generates strength. Passengers on a ship get seasick, but crew members don't. Half of this is due to habit, but before developing this habit, they feel a responsibility for the ship's operation, so they dare not be careless, and naturally don't get seasick.</p>
<p>In cultivating the maritime spirit, in addition to organization, one must also pay attention to: First, always be prepared. Being prepared allows one to respond to situations as they arise, without being caught off guard. Second, be calm and thorough. Things without thoroughness are prone to accidents. Calmness and thoroughness are two sides of the same coin. The Japanese spirit is a concrete manifestation of the maritime spirit. From the above, the cultivation of the maritime spirit is by no means a one-day effort, nor is it achieved by chance. The great power that Japan was able to exert during the Greater East Asia War was indeed thanks to the maritime spirit.</p>
<h3>Maritime Life and Maritime Education</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The significance of "Sea Day" is to give the general public a deep understanding of maritime life. Maritime life, simply put, is the daily life on a warship during peacetime. This is the first step in maritime education.</p>
<p>Life on a warship can be seen as a society or as a family. It is a harmonization of the strict education of a stern father and the loving education of a kind mother full of affection. The characteristics of this life are as follows:</p>
<p>First, navigation is the primary focus at all times, even in peacetime, as if in a battlefield. On a warship, even during holidays, no more than half of the crew is allowed to go ashore. In case of an accident, such as a storm or a fire, there are sufficient personnel to respond. The so-called "always on the battlefield" is this kind of life. All maritime life is based on this.</p>
<p>Second, a warship is not a government office, but a warm family. From the captain to the lowest-ranking soldier, they eat and sleep together. In wartime, this family is a fortress. All crew members share the same fate with the fortress. All crew members are closely united, thus creating the most orderly society.</p>
<p>Third, the crew members never forget the spirit of sailing. That is, when a ship enters a port and anchors, it has already turned its bow to prepare for departure. If the ship simply drops anchor as it is when entering the port, it will take a lot of effort and delay the departure time when leaving the port. In war, even five minutes is a significant factor in winning.</p>
<p>"Cleanliness" and "Orderliness" as Cultivation</p>
<p>Cleanliness and orderliness are one of the most important cultivations of maritime life. Imagine living a collective life in a narrow ship. If one person is careless and unhealthy and contracts an infectious disease, wouldn't it spread to the entire crew? Therefore, everyone pays attention to their own physical cleanliness and the neatness of their clothing, naturally fostering a clean and pure atmosphere. After using an item, it must be returned to its original place so that one does not become flustered when retrieving it next time. This is one of the most important habits to develop, and it should be cultivated from childhood.</p>
<h3>Sparks and Cigarette Butts Are More Terrifying Than Bombs</h3>
<p>Every crew member on a warship must conduct a detailed inspection of people and things every day. The inspection of people is the cleanliness and orderliness mentioned above. The inspection of things is the preparation of weapons, machinery, and everything else on board. The night patrol is especially important. Every night, after all crew members are asleep, the executive officer or important officers must inspect the entire ship's condition, paying particular attention to sparks and cigarette butts. These are more terrifying than bombs, because bombs only fall during wartime, while sparks and cigarette butts can become a cause of disaster at any time. This attention to detail is also very important in air defense training.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Strict Time Adherence</h3>
<p>People engaged in maritime life generally have a spirit of strict time adherence. If everyone can be punctual, any work can be done with maximum efficiency. This is especially important in warships, because wars are often won or lost based on time. Even if a fleet has fewer forces, if it concentrates faster than the enemy, it can gain an advantage and defeat the enemy before the enemy concentrates. The first priority of cooperation is the strict adherence to time. Although society often talks about adhering to time, it has not been thoroughly implemented, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Maintaining Order</h3>
<p>Whether viewed from a moral or habitual perspective, maintaining order is absolutely necessary. For example, when descending from a warship to a small motorboat, if everyone does not follow the order and rushes ahead, the boat is in danger of capsizing. Similarly, in general society, boarding streetcars, trains, or any public place in an orderly manner is faster, while rushing ahead is actually slower. Haste makes waste, that is the meaning.</p>
<p>From the above, life on a warship is a harmonization of strict national education, family life, and social life, which is the characteristic of naval life.</p>
<h3>Japan's Third Sea Day: Broadcast Speech by Resident Group Leader Watanabe</h3>
<p>July 20th is Japan's third Sea Day. Local Japanese civilian organizations, such as the Shanghai Branch of the Naval Association, the Shanghai Maritime Roundtable, and the Japanese Resident Group of Shanghai, etc., specifically on the 20th and 21st, will visit the Jiangnan Shipyard and visit the Shanghai Shrine, silently praying for safe navigation and commemorating the sailors who died in the line of duty, to mark the anniversary. Japanese Resident Group Leader Watanabe also delivered a broadcast speech at 6:30 PM on the 18th, entitled "Welcoming the Third Sea Day." He gave a simple and clear exposition on how Japan has strived to engage in naval construction and develop shipping since the Meiji Restoration, and what impact this has had on the progress of Japan's national fortune today. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>July 20th is Sea Day. This year is the third anniversary since the establishment of Sea Day. Shortly after the Meiji Emperor unified the country through the Restoration, he set out to inspect the Tohoku region in the ninth year of Meiji. On July 18th of the same year, he boarded the Meiji Maru at Hakodate and arrived safely in Yokohama on the 20th of that month. Therefore, that day was designated as Sea Day.</p>
<p>Our country is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and one must cross the sea to reach any country. In addition, the country is also composed of many islands. Therefore, maritime transportation is extremely important. It can be called a maritime nation. This is the reason why, since ancient times, our Yamato people have been close to the sea and actively engaged with the sea as a background.</p>
<p>When the black ships arrived in Uraga Bay in the sixth year of the Kaei era, naval thought suddenly surged, and the original face of a maritime nation was restored. The construction of the navy and merchant fleet has since developed extremely rapidly, with each passing day. At the beginning of this Greater East Asia War, the great victories that shocked the world were achieved in the battles of Pearl Harbor, Malaya, Java, and the Solomon Islands. From the Aleutian Islands in the north to Australia in the south, and to the Indian Ocean in the west, our army carried out incomparably heroic and magnificent operations in this vast area.</p>
<p>Japan's maritime spirit is the Yamato spirit cultivated for three thousand years with the imperial family as the center. The maritime spirit of England is actually the spirit of pirates, and the United States is a branch of it, so they are all part of the same pirate family. The Greater East Asia War is a struggle between the Yamato spirit and the pirate spirit. Our 100 million citizens must unite and defeat this pirate spirit.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's shipping industry had already entered and exited the seven seas of the world, completing the control of British shipping. Regarding how these merchant ships fared in previous wars, during the Russo-Japanese War, the army and navy used a total of 266 ships, totaling 670,000 tons, exceeding the tonnage of ships owned by our country at that time by more than 20,000 tons. This excess tonnage was due to chartered ships from foreign countries. In addition, many foreign ships were employed to transport general civilian goods. From this, it can be seen that a large number of ships are required during wartime. This Greater East Asia War is the largest war in world history, and it is also a war that requires the concerted efforts of national resources, materials, and manpower. Therefore, the need for military equipment and materials is extremely large, and the transportation distance is also extremely long. Therefore, there is a need for many transport ships, and ships are also consumable. Not only our country, but every warring nation is doing its best to build ships. Fortunately, Japan's shipbuilding capacity is extremely high. Even if foreign ships are not imported or chartered, it can build ships on its own, and its power is extremely strong.</p>
<h3>How to Strengthen the Greater East Asia Fortress</h3>
<p>— Nan Xiao</p>
<p>(1) The Sea is a Natural Fortress</p>
<p>In the past, Emperor Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall, establishing the foundation for the Qin Dynasty for ten thousand generations, but before the sound of his voice died down, the Afang Palace was reduced to ashes in one night. France built the Maginot Line, boasting of being one of the four great powers, but where is France today? This kind of rise and fall is the law of the universe. The only unwavering fortress is the sea. Only the sea is a natural fortress, and also an important base for offense. Why? Because three-quarters of the Earth is sea. The water of Tokyo connects to Nanjing, Berlin, and Rome. The water of Tokyo and Nanjing can flow far to London and Washington.</p>
<p>Our current responsibility is how to strengthen the Greater East Asia Fortress, and how to attack from the Greater East Asia Fortress. This depends on how China understands the sea and participates in this Greater East Asia Fortress.</p>
<p>(2) The Greater East Asia Fortress</p>
<p>Looking at ancient history, Greek philosophical civilization flourished with the Aegean Sea as its fortress, and Roman religious culture prospered with the Mediterranean Sea as its fortress. In recent centuries, the pirate nation of England, which once dominated the world, used the Atlantic Ocean as its base to exploit our East Asian people. Therefore, to be ignorant of the sea and want to become a great power is like an ant trying to climb the Himalayas. It only climbs a few steps and says, "I have already conquered the Himalayas." We know the plight of the Soviet Union in this.</p>
<p>The law of the universe gives us the opportunity to break the illegal Anglo-American pirate order and create the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we have now built the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean into great maritime fortresses. This great fortress has countless outpost bases, is a treasure trove with unlimited military supplies and weapons, and is an excellent position that can be defended or attacked. Therefore, it can attack Britain and the United States, and retreat to build East Asia. China has already joined the war, Burma has declared independence, and India, which Britain regarded as forbidden, has also risen to independence. The interior of this great fortress, Greater East Asia, is gradually being generated and developed, striving to eliminate inequality in the world and restore the face of East Asia. China has recovered its concessions, Thailand has recovered its lost territories, and the natives of Malaya, Java, and Sumatra are participating in politics, and the Philippines will soon be independent. All these phenomena in recent months prove the completeness of the internal outline of the Greater East Asia Fortress.</p>
<p>The major issues that have not been successfully resolved after a hundred years of bloody struggle in the interior of the natural fortress have been realized at once. These reconstructions inside Greater East Asia are nothing more than work that follows the laws of the universe. The so-called Greater East Asia Fortress is the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean mentioned above. If there is an ocean, it must be built into a fortress immediately, and there must be a powerful and unparalleled navy at sea. Therefore, China should think about how this fortress was formed and how to make it stronger.</p>
<p>(3) England's Pirate Behavior</p>
<p>Since the 17th century, when the enemy nations Britain and the United States began their modern colonial movement, they have invaded our fortress, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Since then, our suffering has deepened. We should remember that people of color have been played in their palms and treated as slaves in exchange for their goods. The first step in England's pirate invasion of East Asia was to occupy a corner of India with a dozen people. Later, they fired rifles and cannons, continuing their so-called "hunting Indians" pirate behavior, sowing discord among East Asians and even kings, and causing cultural decline. The English historian Macaulay described the situation at the time with this passage: "It's interesting to see the blacks falling one after another. Eleven have been shot dead today." This statement simply treats Indians as beasts. Also, KA Marrison, in his book "The Indian Rebellion," has the following passage: "It is a fun game to kill men, women, old and young with double-barreled guns."</p>
<p>So, what did they do in China? First, they poisoned the people with opium. Second, they absorbed silver to their country. Therefore, for the past hundred years, we have been living under hypocritical culture. For example, most drug addicts are still indulging in meaningless pleasures. Except for Japan, no country in East Asia has ever thought about the role of the vast ocean, let alone thought about reviving East Asia, creating Eastern culture, and East Asian society.</p>
<p>(4) The Greater East Asia Fortress is Completed</p>
<p>Japan takes ocean development as the foundation of its nation-building, regards the sea as its lifeline. For a hundred years, Japan has endured repeatedly, studying diligently, strengthening its military and enriching the country, building a powerful navy, and moving towards defeating the non-East Asian political and economic order. Therefore, for the sake of construction, it had no choice but to quarrel with China. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States retreated steadily, and the Greater East Asia Fortress was completed in one fell swoop, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands in the south, and to the Indian Ocean in the west. Of course, we shed a lot of blood to build this fortress. Since the China Incident, loyal and brave soldiers have shed rivers of blood to build it. Even the wood in China and the stones in the concessions were stained with fresh blood when the British and Americans were driven out, and even now they are still crushing the invading British and American forces who are constantly attacking the Greater East Asia Fortress. We hope that China, Burma, India, and each country will use their wisdom to flourish under the character of East Asia. The fall of Attu Island is just the defeat of a guard post in the Greater East Asia Fortress.</p>
<p>(5) How China Should Strengthen the Fortress</p>
<p>When we turn to the modern history of East Asia, it is undeniable that there is a page of "loss" for the East Asian people. We must use the glorious words of "revival" to bury the East Asian history after December 8th of last year.</p>
<p>Looking at the interior of the Chinese people, they think: "The construction of Greater East Asia only needs to be borne by Japan. We are very interested in which side, Japan or Britain and the United States, will win." People with this kind of wrong and evil idea still exist in fact. The most confused of them is the Chongqing regime. However, without Japan, can China preserve the land left by its ancestors? Can China's national capital be fully realized? Why did Japan return the concessions? Why did Japan cultivate China's autonomy? If this phenomenon is regarded as a decline in Japan's national power, it is an extremely superficial view. I dare to say that with Britain and the United States as opponents, only the Japanese Navy is enough. If we investigate the Japanese pilots' volunteers, military spending, and shipbuilding capacity, we can make this new judgment. Thus, the army can use its remaining forces to build the interior of Greater East Asia. I am reminded of the following sentence: Sun Yat-sen said, "Without Japan, there would be no China, and without China, there would be no Japan." The history of China and Japan in the past few years has fully proved Sun Yat-sen's words.</p>
<p>It is necessary for China to be strong. If it wants to be strong, it must always pay attention to history and geography. The unspoken history of East Asia and the unspoken ocean clearly indicate the future development direction of Greater East Asia. I fervently hope that China will further understand the importance of the sea.</p>
<p>The cultural prosperity of the world to this day is the result of mankind's use of power to navigate the sea. Therefore, only politicians who understand the sea can become world politicians. Those who live on land are, to put it bluntly, just like some blind men. One blind man touched the elephant's leg and said that the elephant was a big pillar. One blind man touched the elephant's belly and said that the elephant was a slab. One blind man touched the elephant's tail and said that the elephant was a thin and long thing. Similarly, it is extremely difficult to judge the battle situation in the Indian Ocean, which is several times larger than the Eurasian continent, while living in the deep mountains of Sichuan. No matter how poor our family is, there should be a world map on the table. In war, no one can cross the ocean. If the Chinese people understand the ocean and study the Greater East Asia Fortress, they will no longer be confused by the gentlemanly propaganda of the British and Americans!</p>
<p>We want to say the following to the Chinese people:</p>
<p>"Now and in the future, if you want to strengthen the country and enrich the people, you must first conquer the sea." This is already the truth of national development, and "Without understanding the sea, you should not discuss the Greater East Asia War," is the most important saying in this war.</p>
<p>China has already begun to sort out important domestic issues and has now joined the war and is the most powerful nation. If one shouts loudly to join the war but takes a bystander's attitude in their heart, then the mission of China's East Asia cannot be completed. This is obvious.</p>
<p>Japan's national policy is to establish the nation on the sea, develop with the sea as the stage, and complete the defense of Greater East Asia with the sea as the Greater East Asia Fortress. We ask China to pay attention to the sea, so that China is expected to be a strong country in the future. At the same time, China must be aware of the responsibility imposed on China and the mission to complete this responsibility. (Translated jointly on July 19th)</p>
