<p>社評</p>
<h3>加強國民政府</h3>
<p>爲了參戰後擔負起更重大的時代的使命，爲了進一步和日本協力以爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利，加强國民政府，是目前東亞政治上最重要的任務之一。可是，如何加强國民政府？道是一個非常重要的問題，所以，我們敬向中日當局和我國同胞作懇　的獻言：</p>
<p>「加强國民政府」，是日本這幾年來一貫的政策，不是一句新的口號，幾年來的努力，國民政府的地位，自然已有了極大的增進，不過，旣然到了幾年以後的今日，還栗更進一步的推行「加強國民政府」的政策，那麼，無論如何，過云的努力還沒有完全達到最理想的境地，却是無庸諱言的了。我們今後要求更大的效果，還得檢討過去的努力，究竟有什麽未盡的地方？非常明顯，過去日本對於「加强國民政府」的努力是誠摯的，一貫的，然而效果還不能滿足大家的理想，究竟是爲了什麼呢？這裏，不能不希望日本當局注意：一個理想的政府，決不是單靠上層少數人的努力就可以的，它必須有多方面的條件。若是只知道加强一部份人的力量，單純的加强某一個政黨或某一個政權的力量，而忽視了廣大人民的意志，不同時注意培植和加强人民的力量，那麽，結果一定不會圓滿。所以，我們在這裏敬以摯誠向日本當局獻言，必須認識這一點，在進行「加强國民政府」的工作的時候，同時，至少以相等的力量，來協助培植和加强中國人民的力量。只有人民力量强化了，才會有好的政府，然後有眞正有力的政府</p>
<p>國民政府本身這幾年來的努力，自有相當成績。而且在最困苦艱難和最不安的環境下進行的，其苦心是値得欽佩的。不過，現在國家仍在支離破碎的狀態，人民仍在驚風駭浪之中掙扎着，老實說，正是舉目有河山之感，生靈有塗炭之苦。石達開所謂：「我志未遂人已苦，東南到處有啼痕」，這恐怕正是每一個抱負革命意志的人所共有的觀感吧。特別是在這新時代，不僅要求本國一切問題的解決，而且還要擔負起協力大東亞戰爭建設東亞新秩序的責任，那麽，就誰也不能滿足於過去的小小成就，而感覺到「加强國民政府」的迫急需要了。不過，如果不在實際工作上表現出來，換一句話說，不替人民解決目前一切困難問題，那麽，「加强」政策的前途，恐怕仍舊不能令人樂觀吧。因爲人民意旨的向背，是一國政權眞正强弱的反映，凡是爲人民所愛好所擁護的政府，它才是眞正强力的政府。這不是書生之談，也不是紙上談兵，這是中國歷史和政治的規律。所以要求「加强國民政府」，首先要使廣大的人民對國民政府了解，愛好，和眞誠的擁護，才能集中全國一切力量：而要求全國人民對國民政府一致了解愛好和擁護，那就得首先多替人民解決困難問題，解除人民的痛苦，加强人民的力量。「庶民足，君孰與不足」？國民政府的加强便會在無形中實現了！</p>
<p>最後在全國人民方面，我們要注　現實，不尙空想。注視現實，就可以很明顯的看到，如果我們有一個無力的政府，那麽我們就只有吃更多的苦，受更多的難，相反的，如果我們有一個有力的政府，我們的痛苦可以解除，我們的前途就一定更光明。因此，在目前，我們應該協助加强國民政府。但是，最重要的，還在希望政府從速成立民意機關，使人民參加政治，監督政治，這樣才是最有力的協助政府：也只有這樣才是最眞實的協助政府，如果人民是鹿豕犬馬，是一盤散沙，那麽，天天希望人民「協力政府」，都沒有什麽用的。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭的經濟戰略　日商工省　總務課長　美濃部洋次　確立個力的責任制　完成總力結集體制</h3>
<p>— 丁：譯自一月四日朝日新聞</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭實爲賭民族生死與亡的戰爭，故必須舉國家的總力集中動員於戰爭，以得其最高的能率和效果。這裏如何把國家的總力配置運營，方能發揮其最高的能率，這個問題便成爲一個最緊急的問題而被提出了。</p>
<p>當實行戰爭之際，比什麽都要緊的，乃是把國家所有力量爲戰爭而總動員。然而這裏所謂總動員，係指「戰時爲達成國防目的，必須統制運用人的及物的資源，使國家之戰力得最有效的發揮」（國家總動員法第一條）而言，鑒於現代戰爭規模的擴大和其澈底性，只把現有之人的及物的要素，照原狀動員，是不够的，到了必須把國力經過冉編成而使其發揮的時候了，這是大家所熟知的。抑所謂國家總力對於一定目的之最高度發揮，是和各個的力各自最高度發揮的總和，本質上不相同的，這正如在一定的指揮之下有組織力的近代之戰，和以各個的力爲中心之封建時代的戰鬥，其本質不相同一樣。更澈底的說，正如有組織的力和烏合之衆的力，總和各不相同一樣。故愈是高度機械化而且戰錢擴大的近代武力戰、其戰門也愈益綜合化，有機化，計劃化。經濟戰在這一點上，也沒有什麽不同的地方，然而經濟的現階段，則是所謂自由主義的資木主義經濟，而且是由以一個」爲中心的組繳來運營着的，現在已不待再說了。所以在那樣的經濟組織裏，要把國家的總力作爲綜合的力，使其最高度發揮，以達一定的目的，到底是不可能的。故在第一次歐洲大戰中有着慘澹艱苦的經騐而且明察將來戰鬥的本質之德國，已傾注其全力於國內的冉編成了。日本亦自滿洲事變以來，漸向國內的再編成之途進行着。不過尙未確立自　自足體制，而且以輕工業爲中心　運營着的日本，却不得不求戰爭的供給來源於國際經濟，故猶不能脫離自由主義經濟的本質，這實在是使國內經濟的再編成，不得已而遲延的原因。</p>
<p>可是從是日事變發生以來逐漸擴火着的戰爭，在十方面已在强力地要求國家總力的集巾動員，故今日乃必然的產生了所謂「强權的劃一統制體系」。</p>
<p>然而以各個運營爲中心之自由主義的資本主義體制，和以總力的集中動員爲目標之强權的統制，其間會產生各種的矛盾乃至尅摩擦，是必然的事，當爲大家所熟知的。故在許多的經濟運營上，發生了種種的障碍。而且戰時經濟必然的要求，對於成爲自由主義經濟中心的價格面，先伸人了統制的第一隻手，一邊自由主義經濟的本質，別連任何的再編成都沒有，故更使其隙碍擴大了。換句話說，自由主義經濟的缺陷和就制經濟的缺陷，雖說它們是同時呈露，這是它們表現的狀態。不過在前年十二月七日大東亞戰爭勃發同時，日本的經濟和國際經濟的紐帶就完全斷裂，脫出了自由主義經濟的範疇，同時衝入了必須完成眞正的國家總力集中動員的階段。尤其是與以經濟力見勝的美英一一國爲敵，欲爭國家的存亡，的確已臨到須以日本經濟力的結集爲急務之時了。現在賦與我們的使命，乃是把經濟力的集結體制儘早一日完成，在經濟戰或生產戰中，確立必勝不敗的形勢，作殊死的突擊一事而已。近時對於增强生產的要求漸高，各種對策也已在不絕提倡着了，這是衆所周知的。關於這些對策中各個的具體問題，現在暫且不提，至其大體的傾向，則可大別爲如下二個方向。</p>
<p>其一，爲着重於潑揮個入的創意和發明，其二，爲主張經濟性格之國家性的强化。前者認爲隨着統制的強化，對於個人自由的限制，次第及於瑣末部分，個人的創意和發明，完全被滅，而且連努力的目標也在被消滅之中，這現狀當然會减弱個人的責任感，消耗其對於生產的熱心，故這一點實是現在統制的一個缺陷，是必須改善者之一。然而把以「個」爲中心的經濟之運營，改變爲以「全體」爲中心的運營，決不是消滅個人的創意和發明，這是不待言的。只是主張對於發揮個人之力的方向，範圍，換言之，卽個人在全體之中應分擔的任務和責任，絕對必須加以明確的規定，俾國家總力得以最高度的發揮。而在其範圍內，爲達成任務，當然應把其創意和發明完全活用。不但如此，母寗是絕對必要的。然而其創意和發明，非爲其所負之國家的任務在戰爭遂行上達成職責所必需者不可，荀爲他種目的之創意和發明，自　不可，固不待方。是以着重於個人的創意和發明而過爲否定統制如上所述者，在結論上，不能不說有錯誤。抑且國家經濟乃是一個綜合的有機體，施於其一部分的方策，結局必至影　及於其全體的機能，事變以來，一個統制更產生別個統制，遂至其統制不得不被全面的擴大，由這個事實，便可澈底明白了。</p>
<p>故一部分的統制解除，決不能說就可使這個所求者有效的實現，，我們必須認識自由主義經濟的長處，唯有在全面的自由主義經濟之下，方能有最有效的發揮，而且不限於個人常能認識全體者。所以縱令在其自己的職域中如何巧妙忠實，若非在綜合的全體的制約之支配下者，則亦沒有不把綜合力弱化的。然而現在的狀態，事實上確有使個人失去其目標因而有消磨其熱心和責任之虞，關於這點，當然不能不儘早一日把它改善不可。但是，因此之故，第一必須使各人的任務具體化和明確化，如其不使所負的任務，亦即責任明確而只求努力，則必至徒使疲於奔命，不然則唯有使其奔趨自己之目的而已。次就其遂行任務言之，此則必須講求信賞必罰之策，同時或明定應與如何的賞罰。在自由主義經濟，有所謂「利潤」這個明瞭的目的，它的結果直接成爲及於個人自己的局面，因此個人的創意發明就能對它發揮，並使其活動活潑。是以如欲否定其僅以利潤爲目的者，必須代以明確的目的任務，且其目的非像有利潤那樣具體的不可。而最後爲遂行所賦與的任務，必須把所應與的力——資材，勞力，資金等－明確規定，且講求得以確保它的方策。不明白這點，則不但任何創意和發明都不可能，連努力目標也不能樹立。在自由主義經濟中，這些的獲得，完全是自由的，而且是委諸一己的責任的。然而全體在綜合約計畫之下運營時，則這些的從得，就不能完全放任自由。那麽就必須弄明白確保還些的方途，同時必須把應與的量明確規定。</p>
<p>以上的方策樹立後，現狀的缺陷方纔可以除去，若不確立這些要點，便不能不說是徒然始終於煩瑣的末梢的統制，而生產的增强也不可期。然則爲確立這些要點，應該有怎樣的方針呢？討論到這個問題時，結果，便會覺得後者所論的和前者所主張的，自然一致了。即因此全經濟力的組織化是件必要的事。隨着其組織化，順應實行戰爭所必須的各個經濟力的配置，即國力的再編成，也當然有其必要了。又樹立這些經濟力的綜合運營計畫，以總力的最高度發揮爲目標，成爲賦與各個經濟力以具體的任務之前提，先被要求了。然而各個的經濟力，以其所負的任務爲中心而運營時，其性格便不能不說完全具有國家的性格。若隨其遂行任務的適否而確立信賞必罰之策，則各個經濟力之國家的性格便告完成。故兩者所欲百者，實其達到目的之方法論不同而已。換言之，不過把現在呈現的缺陷之兩面，即山自由經濟而來的缺陷和由統制經濟而來的缺陷，加以各別的　判而已。故其結論所趨，可認爲同歸於一。要之，當可認爲在於確立以國家總力作綜合運營之體制，和確立對於其部分之各個的力的責任制。（立譯）</p>

<h3>印藏邊境（五）</h3>
<p>— 家源</p>
<p>－一月五日澳門轉來－</p>
<p>下午記者繞行市區一週，直至山嶺　處，遙望喜馬拉雅山，惜爲雲霧所　，大吉嶺至此爲止，遠望則爲深壑一片，　約百餘里，再上則爲層　　牟，以迄喜馬拉雅山之高峯，風景之佳，於是爲　。俄頃濃霎上升，瀰漫山野，但見雲海一片，書戰大吉嶺爲入藏之孔道，事實由大吉嶺並不能直接入藏，仍需取道噶倫堡前往。</p>
<p>至此山嶺之最高處，有西藏之啦嘛寺，建築年代甚久，其地原爲西藏屬地，故藏人居此甚多，白經英人銳　經營，已完全歐化，藏人之遺跡，除此以外，已甚鮮見。</p>
<p>山嶺之側，建有公園，沿着山嶺均舖有柏油馬路，處處是道，通至山下市塲、途中遊人絡繹不絕，由於氣候較凉，每當晨昏，人們均衣大套，散步於雲霧之中，大有靈飄欲仙之概。</p>
<p>市內有較佳之電影　備，售票與加爾各答相仿。新　紙此間尙缺，全恃加爾各答之隔日報紙應市面銷售，市內亦有書店一所，規模甚大，單是關於西藏之書籍，即不下數十種，但售價恒在二三十盾以上。</p>
<p>此間華僑不及千人，大都經營商業，設有中華會館，作爲華僑團聚之所，每當過午以後，咸羣集會館，作竹城之戲。另外並由會館創辦中華小學一所，有學生四十名，負責敎務者，係譚雲山先生由中國學院派來之巴宙先生。至學校經費，則由會館向賭客中抽頭，來培養學校，聽之令人發笑。</p>
<p>復返噶倫堡</p>
<p>十月一日，復返噶倫堡，因大吉嶺典噶倫堡之間，僅一山之隔，另有便道直遠，的三十英里，汽車費單叫需四十羅比。俟至午後，並無同行客人，結果以三十五元獨乘小轎車一輛，是時因恐噶倫堡之警察認出，故另易便裝，剪去長髮，換了一頂硬充帽，臉上又架了一副眼鏡，自以爲已另改爲一副　容，孰意車出市口，於途中時，反爲英國軍十見之立正敬禮，於是更糟！</p>
<p>是日雲淡風淸，喜馬拉雅山高峯卡度奇江從早至晚，完全出現，較之於噶倫堡所見，尤爲明顯，　華僑所談，由此前往上下，需十日路程，英國官員每年夏季必前在一次，均不能到達山峯，每行半山之時，即爲冰塊打傷，山頂之嚴寒由此可見。</p>
<p>途中竹林交錯，林木相參，時見竹籬茅舍，及住居之錫金土人，風景如畫，忽而雲霧遮道，忽而風淸氣爽，遙觀雪山，愈行愈遠，直至山下，即不能再見雪山之貌，下山後經一大鎭，即過大　並入大道，前後只三小時即到達噶倫堡。</p>
<p>向西藏躍馬前進</p>
<p>折回噶倫堡後，即遵照敖干先生之　，潛居不出，至晚隨沈校長由後山繞道至敖干先生寓所，再談入藏事件，據稱人已雇到，但不通漢語，惟其人甚有機智，途中可担保別無問題但其要價甚昂，數月前曾送一國人至拉薩，連同馬匹僅兩百盾，現在却要價五百元羅比始有前在，因此作罷。</p>
<p>敖十先生復稱，如若別無辦法，當　其僕人送往，其人爲西康安充巴驟籍，爲人甚忠實，　甚愚笨，可兼任翻譯，每日祗給予一盾半之工資即可，因除此以外，別無他法，於是即決定由其僕人隨同入藏。至此爲了解西藏之近况起見，就詢敖氏，復承其十一相吿，至所需之藏裝，亦由其定做完成，僅馬匹一時未能雇到，因其時正値印度忙於過年之際，因此連候三日，始雇定三匹，一匹載運行李，兩匹乘座，但祗能達到帕德里即止，共計價銀五十餘元。</p>
<p>途中因食物缺乏，所有米麵，均須隨身自備，並需自備鍋灶，沈校畏因兼任　藏委員會西藏辦事處之聯絡員，故對我一切幫助甚大。由於一切巴吿解決，乃於四日午後，由雇用之隨從携來一印度　髮匠，爲我削髮，記者原有削髮之願，出六根未凈，難達彼岸，至此乃提前削髮，理髮匠之刀快手快，俄頃之間，已變爲光圓之禿頭矣。</p>
<p>頭髮隨去，而酒肉尙用，因西藏啦嘛本不忌暈，承黎家之情，每日兩餐飯，三次茶點，攪擾過甚，隨於五日當晚正式吿辭，並至敖干先生處作別，是夜改裝，行數里，走出市區，即於次日淸晨策馬前往西藏。（完）</p>

<h3>盼望華中鐵道公司　改善北站進口秩序　白虹</h3>
<p>京滬杭兩路的旅客，談起北站上火車，無不舉擊蹙額，然而如何困難，非身歷其境，不能盡悉。月初因事去京，總算得到機會，領略其中原因。</p>
<p>現在旅客進站，不許逕走大門，無論空身或携帶行李，均須由北首木棚內進入。棚境狹窄，人與行李同時擠軋，且須停頓其巾，等候前面檢查，於是擠得水洩不通，汗流浹背，胸肘難伸，往往鵠立半日，尙未得入站，祇聽得婦孺老年的哭喊。棚外則行列幾延至寳山路，强悍者爭先，守秩序者永遠落後，焦急之狀，簡直不能想像。同時扒手與非法份子，大肆活動，木棚右近遺失零件，已屬家常慣事，尤其是夜車時間燈光不明之下。不在乎錢而貪舒適的人，可以與那邊，「露天嚮導談判價錢，化二三十元便可設法使你進去。凡此情景，我相當局的人，一定無從知道。</p>
<p>我們切望路政當局，以旅客爲前提，多替旅客們着想。茲附帶貢獻一些改善意見，希望察納：</p>
<p>（一）應設法增加班决，每次並應增加里列，以容納旅客。</p>
<p>（二）進口應分設數　，務使携帶大件行李，與携帶小件零星，與空身客人分開，自可减少擁擠成分。</p>
<p>（三）正門應商得警憲同意，予以開放，使空身旅客，由正門進入，人數分散，即易疏通。</p>
<p>（四）檢查警憲，亦應商請提早開始，是亦可以减少擁塞，維持秩序亦較易爲力。</p>
<h3>再論婦女運動</h3>
<p>— 葉敏鶴</p>
<p>讀了紀新先生的申論婦女運動，我也有些小意見來討論，的確婦女的解放運動至今可以說根本沒有普遍，男女社交到現在還是不能普遍地公開。婦女同樣是一個人，不過生理上的小同，她們同樣有雙手，有敏捷的頭腦來處理各種事務。她們所處理的事務，也不至於比男子落後及延慢，她們也同樣的迅速而處理得井然有序，爲什麼不能享受和男子同樣的權利呢？</p>
<p>再一方面也有人　終視女子爲無用的人，他們以爲婦女祗配爲一個家庭的主婦，領小孩煮飯和燒菜，却小配在社會上服務，女子們無論在什麽機關團體服務，總是很容易遭遇到輕視或議論，甚至於說出不能入耳的話來侮辱她們，把花瓶，活動玩具，能開口的廣吿等的綽號，套在她們的頭上。使她們永遠是畏畏縮縮不放大瞻地進取，而不能達到平等的一天。</p>
<p>誰說女子是沒有用的？在蘇聯他們國內的女子不是和男子一樣地參加政治及服役嗎？很多很多機關團體都是女子領導的。這可見得她們的解放運動效力很速，爲什麼中國的婦女解放運動沒有進展呢？可以說，這一半在一班領導者抱着自私的成見，歧視婦女，滿以爲婦女是不配在社會上活躍，把女的始終置在被動的地位，尤其是已生產過的女子，更受到歧視，以爲生產過的女子因有小孩的牽累而分散了她們的頭腦，說是沒有生產　那麽敏捷和專心，他們從沒有想到到過創立一些　兒所，抱着這樣的成見，婦女的解放運動何以能發展？請問世界上那兒有怎麼許多未生產過的知識婦女來期待着呢？一生產就給他們淘汰，這怎麽不使職業婦女們寒心，爲了她們的事業與前途，時有抱着終身不嫁的觀念，這是婦女們的一個苦悶，也是中國婦女解放運動中一個大大的缺點。</p>
<p>再談到另一羣的女子，如舞女，嚮導女，雉妓等，她們也是應該有資格參加這婦女解放運動的，爲了生活的鞭策，環境的不良，而走入岐途，忍受慘無人道的生活，雖然有許多無知的女子甘願墮落，可是有許多受過相當敎育的女子，因受生活的逼迫而出此下策的也不在少數吧，她們不能得到社會的同情，更得不到一些安慰，甚至於有人攻擊她們是阻碍靑年前途的搗亂鬼，麻醉靑年的毒蛇，她們是甘願墮落的嗎？不，絕對不，她們也有熱望和志願，也深望能貢獻一些力量給社會，可是龐大的社會上同情她們的也可以說很少吧，最後我向一班社會領導光生們一個忠實的獻議，女子們也是富有超然思想的，多創立一些對於婦女運動有幫助的機關，共同來推進眞正的婦女解放運動。</p>
<h3>舊歷年關將屆　商市情況轉變　囤戶及零售商急於脫貨　信用借款不易賬務難於清償</h3>
<p>陰歷年關將屆、本埠華人所經營之商號已從事慣例之準備、多數批發商刻正整理存貨、而零售商則已開始作眞正之减價、以使舊貨脫手、惟其他居民及特別從事食物交易者、則仍未忘於往年年節期內、食物禮品價格上升之向例、惟若輩皆共望本年年節時期、禮品價格能保持舊狀、</p>

<p>在此年關相近期內、首先宣稱减價者、厥爲皮鞋、雖然、欲使一週前定價爲六百元一雙之皮鞋、在今售價改爲五百元、則爲不可能之事、惟無論如何、若干式樣過時或有缺點之皮鞋、則確已略有减低價格者、是以一般不欲在修飾上過於拘泥者、多在此時期中購置皮鞋、除此之外、本埠各小商號於最近又循例舉行冬季大减價、雖然其减價商號數目、已較去冬爲少、但此等於今冬髙喊减價者其若干物品例如舊時所囤之貨物、據查確有將其貨價减去百分之二十至百分之二十五之間者、</p>
<p>年關雖屆　債務難理</p>
<p>據調查、新年之禮物、如錦繡手巾縫紉以及相類之貨物、確有特別廉價之顯著現象、其中有减價百分之十或甚至百分之二十相近者、同時又據批發商解釋、在往年舊歷年　巾、一切債務均可淸理、所有帳目均能明白結算、惟現時已非如此、信用貸款事業現已罕有、是以僅一極小部分帳目可以淸理、又悉因年關之逼近、大量食物已爲度過年節之需要、惟實際上食物市况僅允若輩零星逐漸購買、欲一次大量購置食物已感困難、</p>

<h3>中國參戰後　日本國內之輿論　中國參戰</h3>
<p>— 譯自一月十日　每日新聞社論</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發以來，靜待着時機的國民政府，終於蹶然而起，於九日上午十時，堂堂地頒布了對美英宣戰。</p>
<p>國府宣戰的理由，已明示於其宣戰的佈吿文中，乃是將「對於東亞百年以來肆其暴虐而爲東亞民族共同仇敵的美英，決與友邦日本協力擊滅之，以圖復興中國，解放東亞，俾建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序」，「大東亞戰爭勃發後，基於日華基本條約的精神，決意和日本同甘共苦」的趣旨，宜明於中外。然而由於國府的參戰，日華泰在東亞已渾然爲一，與歐洲的德意及其他各國的協力，茶臻緊密而積極化，已至可以其綜合的威力，對付美英了。參戰之後，必有極大的困難隨之而來，非忍受犧牲不可，國府旣深知之，更毅然而出此舉，其勇氣和決斷，吾人對之，實衷心表示敬意。</p>
<p>跟着國府勇氣勃勃的前進的雄姿，日本政府也已使日華的關係達到最大限度的緊密化，同時爲使國府對於共同目的之大東亞戰事的完遂，和大東亞新秩序的建設，有所　獻而無遺憾起見，在國府宣戰佈吿發出之後，立即舉行了「關於協力完遂戰爭之中日共同宣言」，及「關於交還租界及撤廢治外法權等之協定」的換印。前者乃宣示兩國爲完遂共同的戰爭，以不可動搖的決意和信念，在軍事上，政治上，及經濟上，確守完全的協力；後者則明示依照這個共同宜言的本旨，基於尊重中國主權的趣旨，日本交還其在中國各地所有的專管租界，承認中國收回公共租界與北京的公使館區域，同時確允撤廢治外法權，更進而涉及各般事項，概出於好意的措置，極力支持新中國的建設，並關於各種條約，亦加以新的考慮等。此二者實爲日本對於隣邦中國示其最深的友誼之舉，同　，在日華國交史上，有着劃期的意義，自不待言。</p>
<p>關於撒廢在華之治外法權，及交還租界的事，美英於數年來，已有幾次口約給與中國政府，大東亞戰爭勃發後，爲討好重慶政權，防其脫節，於去年十月十日，已與該政權締結了有關於此的協約，可是那時美英旣允交還的治外法權和租界，實際上早已沒有了，然而日本，現在訓有數十萬僑民在中國各地，享有治外法權，租界保有八處，所以同樣是治外法權的撤廢和租界的交還，而日本所實行的和美英的空頭支票，其意義和價値全然不同。對於中國的主械完整，日本所爲者，乃是實質的。國府當局由日本政府得到此等確的，自是衷心表示其滿意，而且本當局的尊重道義和諾言，使中國的夙願一朝得達，此種決斷，吾人亦以爲不可多得。</p>
<p>日本政府之有此決斷，爲的是出於日華提携的根本精神，期待兩國關係之劃期的發展，同時，希冀迅速建設以獨立自主，發揮國民政府的政治力爲基礎的新中國，由於日本政府的道種措置，重慶政權的抗日理論，便完全消失了。</p>
<p>箭已離弦射出了，國府和其領導下的民衆諸君，一年來所熱烈盼望着的參戰，現在巳成爲事實了。然而宣戰佈吿一出之後，國府已由和平政權而向戰鬥政權，民衆則由和平民衆而向戰鬥民衆而飛躍了。吾人對於中國朝野之毅然與日本站在共同戰綫，鼓其勇氣，向擊滅美英之途猛進，不勝爲東亞民族慶幸！（才譯）</p>

<p>中華民國國民政府已於一月九日頒布對英美兩國宣戰，同日於南京簽訂了「關於協力完遂戰爭之中日共同宣言，及「關於交還租界及撇廢治外法權等之協定」，日本政府亦於同時發表了關於此事的聲明。這正是表示大東亞戰爭及中日兩國關係之劃期的發展，吾人對於新中國在在主席領導下的團結，表不着滿腔的敬意。同時，確信必可由此從新樹立適應此新事態的日華關係，而且本則由實行交還此祖界及撤廢治外法權，與新中國的建設有密切之關係，成爲一個解放中國之實行者。此等事實，當可獲得中國國民一齊歡迎的。</p>
<p>國民政府隨着大東亞戰爭勃發，於同甘共苦的新標語之下，爲完遂戰爭，已起而和日本協力了，但在一方面，對於重慶政權之甘受美英驅使，反叛東亞，早已對日宜戰而參加美英戰綫，屢屢搗亂中國內外，則尙未至整備充分的對抗形勢。然而現在由於國民政府的對美英宣戰，及發表中日共同宣言，新的戰時態勢，至此已吿整備。同時，爲謀彼此二國完遂對美英二國之戰爭起見，在軍事上，政治上，經濟上，一切分野，將愈益緊密協力，即國民政府已實際進入與日本同生共死的新關係中了。</p>
<p>國民政府參戰之後，必將集中其努力於對付大東亞戰爭一事，自不待論。然而，特於確立治安以制渝方並英美之陰謀，一方盡其大後方根據地的任務，努力增强生產，常亦爲吾人所期待的。至於生產的增强，則日本的新方策，必能與以極大的助力，由此增進中國民衆的福社，使中國的人心，自然獻其忠誠於國民政府。同時，諒解日本的善意，必至自動的進而協力於大東亞戰爭，而日本所抱的强化國民政府的政治力之夙願，亦得逐步實現了。</p>
<p>現在由於國民政府的參戰，日本在大東亞戰爭中的戰力，必可因之而增强，自不待論。然爲發揮更　著的效果起見，不能不望國民政府今後有更大的努力。國民政府當亦如其宣戰佈吿文中所言，今後除舉其全力與日本協力外，並與滿泰兩國，益謀提携，與盟邦德意等，亦當相與呼應，以期對於終極目的之大東亞建設，及公正的世界新秋序之實現，有所貢獻。</p>
<p>今年秋季，日本將交還中華民國內所有之日本專管租界，承認中華民國收回上海公共租界，厦門公共租界及北京公使館區域，並撮廢治外法權，這正是。在日華關係史上，劃出一個新的時期，國民政府必將以衷心的感激，接受日本的善意，自不待論：而中國的全體國民。當亦能切實感覺其深刻的意義的。這個結果，可以使重慶政權，終於失去其抗日的根據。</p>
<p>因國民政府的參加大東亞戰爭和日本的樹立新對華政策，相信中國便可向着敬仰的國父孫中山先生畢生宏願之大亞洲主義的實現，中國復興，新中國的建設，大踏步前進，同時，對於中國事變的解決，亦可由此而得曙光。而且不單是中國而已，由此鼓舞多年在美英桎梏之下的大東亞共榮圈內一切民族，使知日本對中國的誠意，亦即日本不久對於大東亞共榮圈建設之誠意，因以增厚此等民族對日本的信念，使日本完遂大東亞戰爭，益趨順利，這是可以深信而無疑的，（才譯）</p>

<h3>自中國古物展覽會歸來</h3>
<p>— 馬堅</p>
<p>十六日至十九日，金門酒樓九樓大禮堂每日自上午十時至下午六時舉行古物展覽會，往觀者聯袂接踵，愚亦躬逢其盛，歸來乃作此記。</p>
<p>此次陳列品日中以古器佔大部分，書畫則僅寥寥十餘件，但大都皆爲不可多得之珍品。古器中分石器類，陶器類，銅器類，磁器類等四大類，依次看去，可以看出歷史嬗遞之跡。在玉製石璋之前，夏代早有石璋之作，這里就陳列有夏石璋一件。商代仍還是銅石並用時代，由商代許多石器可以看出。石鳥尊是石製的盛酒器，全體作鳥形，足甚粗大，後來周禮六彝中之鳥彝大概即由此蛻化出來的。商石犧是石刻的臥牛像，姿態古樸，彼時大概已重農業，刻此像已誌對耕牛的崇拜。陶器中，鬲有很多，是後來銅器的典型，定價甚便宜，每件都在四五百元左右。到了唐朝，古樸之風盡失。工藝趨於繊細，展覽會中有唐三采藍釉大犧一件，同爲牛像，但和商石犧是大不相同了。銅器類中，有商饕饕卣一件，蓋鼻作鳥形，兩耳默面，仍不脫「圖騰」遺風，但刻工極精細，令人愛不忍釋。還有好幾件商鼎，花紋，色澤，都好；允以花紋細如髮絲爲難能可貴。漢代古物以鏡爲大宗，上刻人物鳥獸，但已偏重衣　楚楚的文明人。到了六朝，隋，唐，人物允多偏重佛像，那是和印度文化接　以後的事，刻工也愈臻圓潤，美化了。</p>
<p>自晋而後，以迄明淸，磁器多至七八十件，燒工，畫工，都極精美。</p>
<p>書畫類中，有羅塞翁兒樂圖，燕文貴漁樂圖，王陽明上海日翁家書，王思任行書，陳眉公竹石圖……等。我尤愛楊昇僊山樓閣圖，吳文中秋閨夜思圖卷，左良玉揭帖冊等四五件。</p>
<p>雜件中幾塊方章也很古雅，定價千餘二千元左右的頗多，惜有損碎，未免美中不足。</p>
<h3>徵文録取第二名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 劉冠業</p>
<p>今晚，我獨自撑靠在窗前，藉着路旁的燈光，遙視着隔牆的荒野，那枯瘦的柳枝，靜寂的石碑，似乎早就被人遺忘，在這個陰寒的深夜裏，看了它，却更使我　到了孤獨而惆悵。可是我却正可靠這種孤寂來慢慢的咀嚼着過去，幻想着將來……！</p>
<p>若不是近處娛樂塲所裏的聲浪，突然傳入我的耳膜，幾乎使我忘記了這裏是個繁榮的都市，尤其是今晚，又是個値得興奮的「除夕」！哎！道個人人喜愛的夜晚，我却獨個子胡思亂想的躭捆掉了！</p>
<p>時針已越過了十二點，我猛省到一九四二年的除夕已成過去，而今正步入一九四三年的元且了。在過去的一年中，可値得我回憶的却有些什麽呢？於是我不禁不連想到用這淸靜的元旦早晨，來準備些「我今年約計劃」！</p>
<p>當然我不能像孩子們同樣幼稚，單純約計劃說：「我將要用功讀書」，「我將要孝順父母，尊敬長輩，」……或是在書棹前貼了「日新兩個大字。可是我也不能像成人一樣約計劃着將如何從事着他們的事業，雖然我已經漸漸的步入了成人的地位。因爲我至今仍未臉去了讀書的時代。</p>
<p>在我思緒混亂的時候，案頭的書籍倒幫了我一個大忙，我忽然想到我所讀過的「佛蘭克林自傳」。佛蘭克林曾有卜列十三種關於道德圓滿的勇敢和堅毅約計劃：</p>
<p>一、節制：食不過飽，飲不過量。</p>
<p>二、沉默：除非於人於已有利之言不談，避免瑣屑的談話。</p>
<p>三、秩序：你的一切東西該有它們的位置，你的事業之各部份該有它的時間。</p>
<p>四、決斷：決定做你該做之事，做成功你決定之事。</p>
<p>五、儉樸：除我於人於己有利益者不消費。</p>
<p>六、勤勞：母失時，要常常用於有用之事，棄掉一切不需要的勤作</p>
<p>七、誠懇：母爲有害之欺詐，母思邪，必公正，如有言，言必誠。</p>
<p>八、公平：不成人之惡，那是你的責任。</p>
<p>九、中庸：母趨極端，制止以受害而怒憤，惟爲所當爲。</p>
<p>十、淸潔：母不潔於身，母褻服成習慣。</p>
<p>十一、寗靜：母爲瑣事或普通與不可避免之事件而自擾。</p>
<p>十二、貞潔。</p>
<p>十三、　　：效法耶穌與蘇格拉底。</p>
<p>他計劃以一年的期限來完成這些條件，我當然不敢和他打比說我也要在一年之中完成那些條件，而且我的環境也跟他不同，可是，我可以堅決的說一句：「我想盡力的效法他」！</p>
<p>在今年約計劃裏，我想多注重着「決斷，儉樸，勤勞，和誠懇。」而尤以「勤勞」爲最主要，因爲，在我們贖書時代，不應該浪費父母所供給的，所以我們該「儉樣」，而當我們開始學習工作時，也該有「決斷」力，才能無艱困的順利工作着。誠懇」則是人生自幼最先明瞭的敎訓，孩子們自小就常常聽到父母，親長們發出「不可騙人」的禁令。可是，如果我們不「勤勞」却如何能够儉樸呢？我們不免要用錢去主使別人來做着我們所會做而懶着去做的工作，這還不是浪費嗎？又因了懶惰，漸漸的使我們失了決斷力，且當別人詢問時，又會無形中的用假話來搪塞，於是我們又違背了誠懇的條例了！</p>
<p>所以佛蘭克林的父親，在敎訓他的孩子們時，常常引用蘇魯門的一句格言：「凡一生勤勞的人，他將要站在帝王之前，而不站在細人之前。」雖然我們生長在這個前進的時代裏，不會相信這些宗敎的迷信，可是我們至少可從這句話裏看出一些眞理來。而且佛蘭克林本身也以為勞動是得到財富和名聲的方法。（按劉女士現年十九歲上海商學院會計系一年級肄業）</p>
<h3>記忠王李秀成（下）</h3>
<p>— 甫</p>
<p>從來撫良民易，撫亂民難，秀成不獨善撫良民，也會撫亂民。秀成初克蘇州時，隣縣亂民假抗拒太平天國爲名，恣行搶掠，部下有　秀成痛剿的，秀成不聽，出示招其來降，無效，乃親至鄉間曉諭之，而亂民則執機圍之數重，甚且以戈矛指秀成頸，秀成從容說：「我忠王某也，今捨死來撫汝等，願就撫者請棄械，吾　請殺我」。這一幕簡直比郭子儀單騎見回紇還難能，秀成竟坦然慮之，眞正動人。無怪亂民都棄械投誠，旬日之間而元和，吳縣，長洲，松江，太倉等縣都次第敉平。以德感人，以柔施政，秀成是萃儒家，集黄老之術於一身，即曾國藩恐亦不能不爲之低首。</p>
<p>秀成對於部下的士兵，一面的束得很嚴，不許侵擾民衆，一面却和他們同甘共苦，休戚相關，幾次把秀全犒賞他的貨銀，散與士兵不取分文。而因爲秀成紀律過嚴，居官過髙，前旣不得歡心，後來又受制於讒佞，以致累著戰功，而部下鮮有獲得當朝的叙獎者，不免有些怨望，秀成常泣涕　諭他們，勗其戮力王室，部下感其忠　，無不願爲秀成死，所以蘇州之役，各軍皆潰，而秀成之軍獨存。南京被圍時，洪仁　等忌秀成成功，藉防疫爲名，閉門不納援軍，各軍皆譁，莫肯奮鬭，而秀成所部，則無分晝夜，力攻敵營。能得部下這樣的死力，決不是偶然的。所以南京旣陷，十餘萬機軍，寗蹈湯火死，無一肯降淸軍。梁啟超說得好：「金陵城中十餘萬人，無一降者，以視田橫之客五百，其志同，其事同，而魄力之大又百倍之矣。此有史以來戰爭之結局所未曾有者也。」</p>
<p>秀成出身田家，因貧早歲失學，讀書至少，然而資質絕慧，過目成誦。初人軍時，嘗以偷讀經史幾罹刑戮，但是他並不因此而放棄求學的念頭，通顯以後，治軍之暇，仍手不釋卷。太平軍初起義時，因爲痛惡淸政，尤以科舉爲專制帝王束縛人民思想，覇糜士子的工具，反對更甚，因此對於一般經史子集，也禁止誦讀。但是到了定都南京以後，爲收拾人心，延攬人才起見，反而開科取士，模仿滿淸起來。其實太平首義諸將領，大都通曉文墨，秀全本人，就是一個不第秀才，孝廉出身的冀王，是有名的文武全才，其佳句流傳人口，是大家所週知的。韋昌輝楊秀淸等，都曾熟讀經史，並非胸無點墨的人。就是後起之秀的陳玉成，也深通孫子兵法，只有秀成，讀書較少，然而因爲他很努力，後來也　成爲文武全才了。（酬移濟貧金）</p>

<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>他開始說一些小小的笑話－學生們喜歡的笑話－會引起歡笑而同時會在人心裏留下什麽印象的記憶法和變關語。有一個笑話，永遠不會失却牠的動人之力，雖然這只是許多其他同樣笑話中的一個。羅馬的某種法　，可以允許貴族（Patrician）娶平民（Plebeian），不論何時，當他的羅馬史這一課一講到這裏時，他總要加上這樣的話：「因此你們可以知道，如果普勒布斯（Plebs）女士要柏特里西安　（Patrician）先生娶她，而他說他不能够時，她大概要這樣回答：「喔，不對的，你能够，你這說謊的人！」哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>加娣（Kathie　Katherine的暱稱－譯者）也擴大了他的觀察與見解，給了他遠超過勃洛克菲爾德主　屋頂與諸樓尖的眼界，以致他看得見他的本國，簡直就是某種博大精深的東西，勃洛克菲爾德對於這東西，不過是許多匯流而往的溪澗之一。她有一個比他更才智的頭腦，甚至他和她的觀念不表同意時，他也不能使她的觀念混亂；例如在政治上，不管她那一切激進社會黨的言論，他總還是一個保守黨。不過即便他不接受，他却吸收了：她那年輕的理想主義在他成熟的性格上發生了作用，因此產出了很柔和很聰明的混合物。</p>
<p>有時她也用全力勸導着他。例如勃洛克菲爾德在倫敦東部設立着一個敎會，學生們和他們的父母對牠都慷慨地捐着錢，可是難得有什麽親身的接觸。加德鄰却提議，該敎會可以派一個足球隊到勃洛克菲爾德來，和學校的某一個足球隊比賽一下。這個意見是很有革命性的，以致除了加德鄰之外，每一個人都想，這個意見一提出來，一定就會遭到嚴酷的冷待，而不能成立。將一羣陋巷裏的野孩子，帶得來和髙等階級的少爺們軋洶，作樂，在起初看來那簡直只有將事情弄得一塌糊塗，還不如沒有這會事的好。（十三）社會服務</p>
<h3>領到助學金後之感想</h3>
<p>— 蘇民中學　吳根生</p>
<p>時代的巨輪一刻不停的向前馳着，屈指計算，自從得到助學金到現在，已將第四學期了，在過去三學期中，我能與別人同樣的在敎室中靜聽，能得可貴的智識，而不至於受到失學的痛苦，這當然是申報的各位主持助學金委員，和一般社會熱心人士所賜給我的了。</p>
<p>回憶我自從災童敎養所培植到小學畢業後，常常爲自己的前途焦急悲感，我知道學問是事業的基礎，沒有淵博的學問，那裏有光明的前途。所以我覺得　續求學是當時先解決的問題，於是便在毫無頭緒中勇敢的向申報呼籲，竟能得到社會熱忱人士的同情，和贊助，又承助企主持委員努力的提携，才能得到經濟求學的機會。</p>
<p>我在誠懇感謝之餘，更當體會求學之艱難，而益加刻苦奮勉勇猛精進！以報答社會熱心人士。以後更希望多多的救出一般失學同伴，我熱望着助學金發揚光大！再有更偉大的貢獻。</p>

<h3>Strengthening the National Government</h3>
<p>To shoulder a greater mission of the times after participating in the war, and to further cooperate with Japan to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, strengthening the National Government is one of the most important tasks in East Asian politics today. However, how to strengthen the National Government? This is a very important question. Therefore, we respectfully offer sincere suggestions to the Chinese and Japanese authorities and our compatriots:</p>
<p>"Strengthening the National Government" has been Japan's consistent policy for the past few years, not a new slogan. Through years of effort, the status of the National Government has naturally greatly increased. However, since we have reached today, several years later, and we still need to further promote the policy of "Strengthening the National Government," then, in any case, it is undeniable that the efforts of the past have not yet fully achieved the most ideal state. If we want to achieve greater results in the future, we must review the past efforts and see what has been left undone? Obviously, Japan's efforts to "Strengthen the National Government" in the past were sincere and consistent, but the results have not satisfied everyone's ideals. Why is this? Here, we cannot help but hope that the Japanese authorities will pay attention: an ideal government cannot rely solely on the efforts of a few people at the top. It must have many conditions. If one only knows how to strengthen the power of a part of the people, simply strengthening the power of a certain political party or a certain regime, while ignoring the will of the vast majority of people and not paying attention to cultivating and strengthening the power of the people at the same time, then the result will certainly not be satisfactory. Therefore, we respectfully offer sincere advice to the Japanese authorities here that they must recognize this point, and when carrying out the work of "Strengthening the National Government," at the same time, at least with equal strength, assist in cultivating and strengthening the power of the Chinese people. Only when the power of the people is strengthened can there be a good government, and then a truly powerful government.</p>
<p>The National Government itself has made considerable achievements in its efforts over the past few years. Moreover, it has been carried out in the most difficult and precarious and most uneasy environment, and its painstaking efforts are worthy of admiration. However, the country is still in a state of dismemberment, and the people are still struggling in the midst of storms and waves. To be honest, one has a feeling of rivers and mountains everywhere, and the suffering of the people is everywhere. Shi Dakai said: "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and the people are suffering. There are tears everywhere in the southeast." This is probably the common feeling of everyone who aspires to revolutionary will. Especially in this new era, we not only need to solve all the problems of our own country, but also shoulder the responsibility of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and building a new order in East Asia. Then, no one can be satisfied with the small achievements of the past, and everyone feels the urgent need to "Strengthen the National Government." However, if it is not manifested in practical work, in other words, if the current difficult problems of the people are not solved, then the future of the "Strengthening" policy may still not be optimistic. Because the people's will and support is a reflection of the true strength or weakness of a country's regime. Any government that is loved and supported by the people is a truly powerful government. This is not the talk of scholars, nor is it armchair strategy. This is the law of Chinese history and politics. Therefore, to demand "Strengthening the National Government," we must first make the vast majority of people understand, love, and sincerely support the National Government in order to concentrate all the power of the country. And to demand that the people of the whole country understand, love, and support the National Government, we must first solve difficult problems for the people, relieve the suffering of the people, and strengthen the power of the people. "When the common people are sufficient, what is lacking in the ruler?" The strengthening of the National Government will be realized invisibly!</p>
<p>Finally, on the part of the people of the whole country, we must pay attention to reality and not indulge in empty talk. Paying attention to reality, we can clearly see that if we have a weak government, then we will only suffer more and endure more difficulties. Conversely, if we have a powerful government, our suffering can be relieved, and our future will certainly be brighter. Therefore, at present, we should assist in strengthening the National Government. However, the most important thing is to hope that the government will promptly establish a civil organization so that the people can participate in politics and supervise politics. This is the most powerful way to assist the government. Only in this way can we truly assist the government. If the people are like deer, pigs, dogs, horses, or a heap of loose sand, then it is useless to hope that the people will "cooperate with the government" every day.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Stalingrad Repel Extensive Soviet Offensive German Air Force Deployed to Defend Front Lines and Assist in Anti-Soviet Encirclement Strategy</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The German High Command announced at noon today that the fighting on the southern front in the east is extremely fierce due to the severe winter. German troops repelled enemy attacks yesterday, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet side. No less than sixty enemy tanks were destroyed between January 15 and 16. German air force units displayed their power to protect our front lines and assist in the encirclement strategy against the enemy. Our troops are once again engaged in defensive battles in Stalingrad, and all Soviet attacks have been repelled. The German forces in the central sector of the front are still firmly holding their positions and are active at all times. German forces in the Luki area have made contact with reinforcements and broken through the Soviet vehicle front. German air force units have been bombing the Volga River and the upper reaches of the Loire River day and night, attacking the Soviet military supply. The German air force and high-level artillery units shot down 41 Soviet aircraft. The enemy offensive in the Ilmen Lake area has been repelled. In the Lake Ladoga area, repeated enemy incursions have been repelled with heavy losses to the enemy. The port of Murmansk continues to be bombed by German forces, causing appalling losses to the enemy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) According to sources from the authorities in charge this afternoon, the result of yesterday's battle of Stalingrad was that German troops repelled a wide-ranging offensive by Soviet forces. In the central sector of the eastern front, German infantry and artillery launched a two-pronged attack on the Soviet defense line, seizing thirty artillery pieces and capturing countless Soviet soldiers and spoils. In the southern sector of the eastern front, the adventurous attacks of the enemy have been contained after fierce fighting in freezing conditions, and the enemy has been routed, suffering heavy losses. A total of sixty Soviet tanks have been destroyed in the past two days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Yesterday's German war report stated that the German forces in Stalingrad have been resisting attacks from all sides by Soviet forces for several weeks. This shows that there has been direct contact between the two armies in the Stalingrad area and the Don River bend for some time. Since the Soviet army broke through the German positions between the Volga River and the Don River, the German forces in that area were ordered to withdraw to the west. However, strong forces were left in Stalingrad to control the north-south traffic route of the enemy, even if the German forces in that area were temporarily isolated. This German strategy has now achieved its purpose. Soviet traffic on the Volga River has not been opened up by the Soviet side, and the railway along the Volga River has not yet been repaired. The presence of German troops in Stalingrad remains a major obstacle for the Soviet army. The Soviet side is aware of this, so it has launched a full-scale attack day and night, but has not been able to overcome it. The supplies of the German troops in that area are constantly transported by air, and there is no danger of interruption.</p>
<p>The Center of Gravity of the Don River Battle Shifts</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) According to news from the eastern front, the center of gravity of the offensive and defensive battle between the German and Soviet armies on the lower reaches of the Don River has now shifted to the Donets River area. The German forces under Manstein encountered the Soviet forces under Vatutin, who were advancing southwest, at Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, north of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and the village of Livinov on the coast of the Kalitva River, southeast of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and immediately launched a hand-to-hand battle. The 80-kilometer area between the Donets River and the Kalitva River has now become the arena for the two armies. In addition, the Soviet forces under Rokossovsky have recently gathered at the intersection of the Donets River and the Don River, attempting to cross the river when the opportunity arises. However, the main force of the German army has also arrived on the east bank of the river and immediately launched a fierce battle. The German air force also dispatched to assist, and bombed the Soviet forces in that area with dive bombers and strafed them with machine guns. The Soviet forces were unable to resist and retreated eastward. According to a dispatch from Moscow on the 16th, the German counter-offensive has become increasingly fierce, and the speed of the Soviet offensive has become increasingly slow.</p>
<h3>North China Japanese Expeditionary Force Discloses Last Year's Battle Results Japanese Troops Suddenly Launched Fierce Offensive Against Chongqing-affiliated Troops on Shandong Peninsula Yesterday</h3>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Allied News Agency) In addition to the 9,500 captured and 140,000 killed in action by the Chongqing and Communist troops who fought against Japan in the broad plains and mountainous areas of North China last year, another 7,000 surrendered to the Japanese army. This was disclosed by the North China Japanese Expeditionary Force when it reviewed the battle results of last year tonight. Therefore, as a result of the North China Japanese Army's operations in 1942, the Chongqing and Communist troops suffered a total loss of 305,000. According to the communique, the North China Japanese Army engaged in 17,419 battles by the end of December last year, killing 142,006 enemy soldiers, capturing 94,563, and receiving the surrender of 69,522. The Japanese army seized one mountain gun, 680 mortars, 192 heavy machine guns, 1,543 light machine guns, and 84,999 rifles. In December alone, there were 1,459 battles, 8,563 enemy soldiers killed in action, and 7,183 captured. At the beginning of last year, the Japanese army launched a mopping-up operation against the troops of General Fu Zuoyi in the grasslands of the Eighth War Zone of the Chongqing Clique. In early February, the Japanese army attacked the main force of the Communist army and the 18th Group Army of Chongqing, and the war spread to Shanxi Province. At the same time, the Japanese army also attacked the Red Army guerrillas in the suburbs of Beijing and eastern Hebei. The war is still continuing. The Communist army in Hebei Province repeatedly advanced towards Manchuria and was repelled by the Japanese army. The grain-producing areas in the central and eastern parts of Hebei Province were able to restore order. The Japanese army in Shandong Province also launched a mopping-up operation against the Communist army. In late May, the Dabie Mountain battle broke out in the border area of Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi, continuing for three months. The Japanese army entered the Dabie Mountains for thousands of kilometers, eliminating the combat power of the Chongqing and Communist troops. Battles on the banks of Hongze Lake have continued to occur. The Japanese army in that area continued to mop up the 98th Army of the Chongqing Clique and the New Fourth Army of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Qingdao, 17th (Central News Agency) Last night, various Japanese troops separately launched a sudden attack on the 4,000 bandits of the Chongqing Guerrilla Fourth Column, led by Di Shangzhi and Yu Pinshan, who were entrenched in the Pingdu, Gaomi, and Changyi counties of the Shandong Peninsula. The encirclement line was gradually narrowed in an encirclement. By dawn on the 17th, the puppet troops had been completely surrounded and subjected to a fierce attack.

<h3>Political Situation in Hubei Province Gradually Returns to Normal Yang Kuiyi Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Yang Kuiyi, Chairman of Hubei Province, was recently summoned to Nanjing by the Central Government to attend important central meetings. Yesterday, Mr. Yang made a brief statement at Qiu, saying: "Since the incident, Hubei Province has been in a special situation due to being on the front line of the war, and it has been difficult to promote government orders. Since I was ordered to preside over Hubei, I have made great efforts to rectify it. The first priority is to adjust the officialdom. Then, in mid-October of last year, I convened the first provincial county administration meeting to discuss the implementation of county administration. Therefore, the civil affairs of Hubei Province today have returned to normal. In terms of finance, of course, we focus on the reorganization of the land tax and the increase in tax revenue. We have organized a land tax committee, which is organized by the heads of various departments and offices, to discuss the current policy of reorganizing the land tax and future collection. In order to save the treasury and promote administrative efficiency, I have successively abolished or merged institutions with similar natures and unnecessary superfluous institutions. Personnel who are not effective in handling affairs have also been eliminated. Therefore, the revenue and expenditure in terms of finance are also suitable for offsetting each other. In terms of construction, Hubei Province has always been known as a disaster area, and water conservancy and dike projects are extremely important. Therefore, I attach great importance to the construction of dikes, increasing production, and other projects in Hubei Province. Various projects are being actively planned. In terms of transportation, except for special cases, most have been restored, improved, and strengthened. In terms of education, due to funding and talent, in addition to primary schools, there are also provincial normal schools and provincial middle schools. In the future, we plan to add more middle schools. As for military and public security, the original 11th and 12th Divisions have been reorganized and completed. Two other parts of the army have also been incorporated. After I return to Hubei, I plan to personally inspect the counties and show the central government's intention to love the people, and to determine the meaning of participating in the war, so that the people in the peaceful area can strengthen their confidence and strengthen public security in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In addition, with regard to promoting the New Movement, Hubei Province plans to change the original New Movement Association into a branch in the future in order to follow the general association's policy and promote the New Movement. In short, all administrative affairs in Hubei Province depend on the cooperation of inside and outside, and all have returned to normal."</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Resumes in Libya British Attack Unsuccessful Allied Forces in Tunisia Reorganized Supply Lines Bombed by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Allied News Agency) This official source claimed last night that British General Montgomery launched a new offensive with the Eighth Army in Libya on Friday and was badly beaten by German General Rommel's forces and retreated after being wounded. On Saturday morning, he attacked the Axis forces again. At the same time, land activities in Tunisia were hampered by bad weather, but the German Air Force attacked on Friday and was exceptionally successful, destroying 42 Allied aircraft. A German news agency described the situation in Libya last week, saying that the British army launched an offensive and suddenly attacked the southern side of the Axis forces' positions, attempting to encircle the German army. However, they were met with resolute resistance from the German and Italian forces, so they attacked repeatedly without success. By nightfall, the British army stopped attacking. Of the 150 tanks, 35 were destroyed and left in front of the Axis forces' lines. On Saturday morning, the British army used artillery to bombard, attempting to shake the German and Italian forces' positions. Details are unknown. The British army's rear was also heavily bombed by the Axis air force, losing 18 tanks. In Tunisia, the Allied forces, after repeated setbacks in recent weeks, are now transferring reinforcements and reorganizing. On Friday, a German team suddenly launched an attack, destroying a fortress occupied by French rebels more than 100 kilometers behind the front lines. In addition, there were no land activities. The German Air Force was active in the skies over Tunisia and Algeria, attacking the Allied forces' supply lines and bombing the port of Bohn on the Algerian coast, causing a fire. German bombers swept through Allied airfields, bombing and destroying 23 enemy aircraft. German fighter planes also shot down 20 enemy aircraft in aerial combat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The government here announced that the enemy army in North Africa launched a full-scale offensive, which was repelled by the German-Italian Allied forces after a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Shanghai Haitong News Agency) Cairo announced last night that British aircraft were very active in the skies over Tripoli and Tunisia. The port of Tripoli was bombed. London officials refused to confirm the news that an Allied offensive was imminent, but warned the public not to expect too much, as the British army's advance must be gradual.</p>
<p>Italian Ships Attack Algiers at Night Destroying Several Ships in the Port</p>
<p>Rome, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The Italian General Command announced in its war report this afternoon that on the night of January 11-12, an Italian Royal Navy assault ship broke into the port of Algiers and destroyed several enemy ships. A total of one cruiser and three merchant ships were hit by torpedoes, two merchant ships were sunk, and one escaped. Another cruiser was also hit and damaged. Although the port's defenses are known to be tight, our ships were still able to invade its base and return safely. There has only been artillery fire on the Saudi front, and the enemy has not launched a new offensive. In the southern front campaign, the enemy army was defeated and abandoned 120 corpses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) According to German military sources, a German submarine, operating in the waters northeast of Benghazi, North Africa, attacked an anti-Axis convoy heavily guarded by numerous ships and immediately sank two enemy ships, totaling 7,000 tons. It then attacked another convoy and sank two more enemy ships, totaling 12,000 tons.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) According to news from the North African front received here, there was no fighting on land on the northern front of Tunisia on the 15th due to bad weather and muddy battlefields. The Axis Air Force shot down 20 enemy aircraft over the front lines and behind enemy lines. German bomber squadrons also raided enemy airfields on the border between Tunisia and Algeria, destroying 23 enemy aircraft on the ground and destroying several more with machine guns. Another team of German aircraft raided the port of Bono, setting off fires everywhere and destroying countless enemy munitions supplying the First Army.</p>
<h3>Giraud and Darlan are Negotiating, Seeking to Resolve the North African Dispute as Soon as Possible, Otherwise French Territories Will Be Jointly Administered</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The Gothenburg Business Navigation News Correspondent in London said that the negotiations between Giraud and Darlan are progressing smoothly, and the North African dispute may be resolved soon. If the negotiations fail, the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to have the French territories jointly administered by the Allied countries. It is said that the obstacle to the negotiations is the extreme cooperation between senior members of Darlan's staff and Giraud, while Washington has not abandoned its distrust of Darlan.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) The conflict of opinion between the United Kingdom and the United States over the French North African regime has suddenly become more obvious since Darlan's assassination. Recently, the conflict of opinion between the two countries has become more obvious due to the reinstatement of former Interior Minister Bertain. According to dispatches from London, in order to resolve the dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States and clarify the rights of North Africa, the British and Americans have decided to establish another institution in addition to the existing puppet regime, called the French Colonial Administrative Ministry.</p>
<p>Paris, 17th (Central News Agency) Due to the establishment of the French North African puppet regime, disputes have repeatedly arisen among the anti-Axis countries. It is reported that Churchill secretly ceded part of the French mainland to the United Kingdom. The news caused great shock among the French people. Although a part of the French people had previously inclined towards Darlan due to momentary enthusiasm, after learning about Darlan's act of treason, they all hated him to the bone. Therefore, Maude Baugh, who broke away from the United Kingdom on the 16th, met with a French press corps and explained Darlan's act of treason and Churchill's ambitions as follows: "The British government spends about one million pounds a day on subsidies to the Darlan faction. Darlan is in league with Jewish organizations, and his financial resources rely entirely on the British government and the Jews. The price is the transfer of France's Douvres Strait to the United Kingdom. In order to implement this secret agreement, he has exhausted all means to recruit French people in the United Kingdom to join his camp. Those who refuse his demands have their property confiscated or seized. Thousands of French allies are now groaning in the prisons of Mingdao."</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Situation in North Africa</h3>
<p>Rome, 16th (Havas) - Stefani News Agency published a telegram from its correspondent in Tangier this month, analyzing the political situation after the British and American Allied forces occupied North Africa. The gist of it is as follows: North African newspapers attach great importance to General Giraud's visit to West Africa as an administrative commissioner. However, semi-official sources issued a statement stating that the factions in French West Africa are incompatible and the situation is tense. General Giraud recently visited West Africa and repeatedly warned local military and political figures that, while hoping for victory, the various difficulties currently encountered by the Allies should not be ignored. Even the situation in Tunisia should not be taken for granted, as the Axis soldiers are well-trained and good at fighting, well-equipped, and have four years of combat experience. Later, General Giraud delivered a speech in Makhanga, appealing to the French people not to kill each other, but to participate in the war launched by other countries for France. Judging from General Giraud's remarks, it can be seen that the people of West Africa are not satisfied with the development of the war in Africa, and some other factions are trying to seize leadership, condemning the British and Americans for not interfering, resulting in no improvement in the overall situation. In addition, a key figure of the Tegol faction stayed in French Morocco for two months, observing the political situation, and has now returned to Tangier. He said that it is useless for the French to fight for the gold-loving Americans at the cost of their lives and honor. The Americans do not know that the Tegol faction is not an enemy of the Axis powers. So far, the Americans have only bankrupted the African people, caused internal disagreements, and incited anti-French sentiment among the Arabs, making the Jews and Arabs stand against each other. In short, since the North African French have severed communication with their motherland, there have been Tegol, Darlan, and Giraud factions. The changes are all due to American dollars. In the past, at the end of each month, devalued francs were received from Vichy, but now they have been changed to American dollars. In short, the North African French seem to be gradually regretting it.</p>
<h3>Economic Strategy of the Greater East Asia War by Yoji Minobe, Chief of the General Affairs Section, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Japan: Establishing an Individual Responsibility System and Completing a System for Gathering Total Strength</h3>
<p>— Translator: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 4th</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a war that gambles on the life and death of the nation, so the total power of the country must be concentrated and mobilized for the war, in order to obtain the highest efficiency and effect. How to allocate and operate the country's total power in order to exert its highest efficiency, this question has become the most urgent question and has been raised.</p>
<p>When implementing a war, what is more important than anything else is to mobilize all the country's forces for the war. However, the so-called total mobilization here refers to "the need to control and utilize human and material resources in wartime to achieve national defense purposes, so that the country's combat power can be most effectively exerted" (Article 1 of the National General Mobilization Law). In view of the expansion and thoroughness of modern warfare, it is not enough to mobilize the existing human and material elements as they are. It is time to exert national power after reorganization, as is well known to all. Furthermore, the highest degree of exertion of national power for a certain purpose is essentially different from the sum of the highest degree of exertion of individual forces. This is just like the modern war with organized forces under a certain command and the battles of the feudal era with individual forces as the center are essentially different. To put it more thoroughly, it is just like the total power of organized forces and the power of a disorganized crowd are different. Therefore, the more highly mechanized and expanded the modern military war, the more comprehensive, organic, and planned the war. Economic warfare is no different in this regard. However, the current stage of the economy is the so-called liberal capitalist economy, and it is operated by an organization centered on "one," which is no longer necessary to say. Therefore, in such an economic organization, it is impossible to exert the total power of the country as a comprehensive force to the highest degree in order to achieve a certain purpose. Therefore, Germany, which had bitter experience in the First European War and clearly understood the essence of future battles, has devoted its full efforts to domestic reorganization. Japan has also been gradually moving towards domestic reorganization since the Manchurian Incident. However, Japan, which has not yet established a self-sufficient system and is operated mainly by light industry, has to seek the source of war supplies from the international economy, so it cannot get rid of the essence of the liberal economy. This is indeed the reason for the unavoidable delay in the domestic economic reorganization.</p>
<p>However, the war, which has been gradually expanding since the Issei Incident, has been strongly demanding the concentrated mobilization of national power in all aspects. Therefore, today the so-called "authoritarian unified control system" has inevitably emerged.</p>
<p>However, it is inevitable that various contradictions and even frictions will arise between the liberal capitalist system centered on individual operation and the authoritarian control aimed at concentrated mobilization of total power, as is well known to all. Therefore, various obstacles have occurred in many economic operations. Moreover, wartime economy inevitably requires that the first hand of control be extended to the price aspect, which has become the center of the liberal economy. However, the essence of the liberal economy has not been reorganized in any way, which further expands its gaps. In other words, the defects of the liberal economy and the defects of the control economy are revealed at the same time, which is their state of expression. However, at the same time as the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 7th last year, Japan's economic ties with the international economy were completely severed, breaking away from the category of the liberal economy, and at the same time rushing into the stage of completing the true concentrated mobilization of national power. In particular, in order to compete for the survival of the country with the United States and Britain, which are known for their economic power, it is indeed urgent to gather Japan's economic power. The mission now entrusted to us is to complete the economic power gathering system as soon as possible, to establish a winning and invincible situation in the economic war or production war, and to make a desperate breakthrough. Recently, the demand for increased production has been increasing, and various countermeasures have been constantly advocated, as is well known to all. Among these countermeasures, the specific problems of each will not be mentioned for the time being, but their general trend can be roughly divided into the following two directions.</p>
<p>First, to focus on inspiring individual creativity and invention. Second, to advocate the strengthening of the national character of the economy. The former believes that with the strengthening of control, the restriction on individual freedom gradually extends to trivial parts, individual creativity and invention are completely destroyed, and even the goal of efforts is being eliminated. This situation will naturally weaken the individual's sense of responsibility and consume their enthusiasm for production. Therefore, this point is indeed a defect in the current control and must be improved. However, changing the operation of the economy centered on "individual" to an operation centered on "the whole" is by no means to eliminate individual creativity and invention, which goes without saying. It is only advocated that the direction and scope of exerting individual power, in other words, the tasks and responsibilities that individuals should share in the whole, must be clearly stipulated so that the total power of the country can be exerted to the highest degree. Within that scope, in order to accomplish the task, of course, its creativity and invention should be fully utilized. Not only that, it is absolutely necessary. However, its creativity and invention must be necessary for the fulfillment of its national task in the conduct of the war. Creativity and invention for other purposes are naturally impossible, which goes without saying. Therefore, it cannot but be said that there are errors in the conclusion of emphasizing individual creativity and invention and excessively negating control as described above. Moreover, the national economy is a comprehensive organic body, and the policies applied to one part will eventually affect its overall function. Since the Issei Incident, one control has led to another, and its control has had to be expanded comprehensively. This fact can be thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>Therefore, the partial lifting of control cannot be said to effectively realize this seeker. We must recognize the advantages of the liberal economy. Only under the comprehensive liberal economy can there be the most effective exertion, and individuals can always recognize the whole. Therefore, no matter how skillfully and faithfully it is in its own field, if it is not under the control of comprehensive overall constraints, it will not fail to weaken the comprehensive power. However, the current state of affairs does indeed have the risk of causing individuals to lose their goals and thus eroding their enthusiasm and responsibility. This point, of course, must be improved as soon as possible. However, for this reason, first of all, the tasks of each person must be made concrete and clear. If the tasks assigned, that is, the responsibilities, are not clarified and only efforts are sought, it will inevitably lead to exhaustion, otherwise, it will only make them run towards their own goals. Secondly, in terms of performing tasks, we must pay attention to the strategy of rewarding and punishing, and at the same time, we should clearly stipulate what kind of rewards and punishments should be given. In the liberal economy, there is a clear goal called "profit," and its result directly becomes a situation that affects the individual himself. Therefore, individual creativity and invention can be exerted on it and make its activities lively. Therefore, if you want to deny those who only aim at profit, you must replace it with a clear goal task, and the goal must be as concrete as profit. And finally, in order to carry out the assigned task, the power that should be given - materials, labor, funds, etc. - must be clearly stipulated, and we must pay attention to the strategy to ensure it. Without understanding this, not only is any creativity and invention impossible, but even the goal of efforts cannot be established. In the liberal economy, the acquisition of these is completely free and entrusted to one's own responsibility. However, when the whole is operated under a comprehensive plan, the acquisition of these cannot be completely free. Then we must understand the way to ensure these, and at the same time we must clearly stipulate the amount that should be given.</p>
<p>After the above policies are established, the defects of the status quo can be eliminated. If these key points are not established, it cannot but be said that it is a futile start and end to trivial peripheral controls, and the increase in production cannot be expected. Then, what kind of guidelines should there be for establishing these key points? When discussing this issue, as a result, we will feel that what the latter discusses and what the former advocates are naturally consistent. That is, the organization of the entire economic power is a necessary thing. With its organization, it is natural that the allocation of various economic powers necessary for the implementation of the war, that is, the reorganization of national power, is also necessary. In addition, the establishment of a comprehensive operating plan for these economic powers, with the goal of the highest degree of exertion of total power, has become the premise for assigning specific tasks to each economic power and has been requested first. However, when each economic power is operated with its assigned task as the center, its character cannot but be said to have a completely national character. If the strategy of rewarding and punishing is established according to whether it is appropriate to perform the task, then the national character of each economic power will be completed. Therefore, what both parties want to achieve is only a different methodology. In other words, it is just a separate judgment of the two sides of the defects currently presented, that is, the defects from the mountain free economy and the defects from the controlled economy. Therefore, the conclusion that it is heading can be considered to converge on one. In short, it can be considered that it lies in establishing a system for the comprehensive operation of national total power and establishing a responsibility system for each individual force of its part.

<p>Indian Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Indian-Tibetan Border (5)</h3>
<p>— Jia Yuan</p>
<p>－Received from Macau on January 5th－</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the reporter circled the city for a week, until the mountains, overlooking the Himalayas, but unfortunately they were covered by clouds. Darjeeling ends here, and the distance is a deep valley, about a hundred miles. Further up, there are layers of ridges, leading to the high peaks of the Himalayas. The scenery is excellent. After a while, the dense clouds rose, filled the mountains and fields, but all I saw was a sea of clouds. The book says that Darjeeling is the gateway to Tibet. In fact, you cannot directly enter Tibet from Darjeeling. You still need to take the road to Kalimpong.</p>
<p>At the highest point of this mountain range, there is a Tibetan Lama Temple, built a long time ago. The area was originally Tibetan territory, so many Tibetans live here. After being managed by the British, it has been completely Europeanized. Tibetan traces are rarely seen except for this.</p>
<p>A park is built on the side of the mountain range. Asphalt roads are paved along the mountain range. There are roads everywhere, leading to the market at the foot of the mountain. There is an endless stream of tourists on the way. Because the climate is cooler, people wear large coats every morning and evening and stroll in the clouds, with a sense of immortality.</p>
<p>There are better movie theaters in the city, and ticket sales are similar to those in Calcutta. Newspapers are still lacking here. They rely entirely on the Calcutta newspapers of the day before to be sold on the market. There is also a bookstore in the city, which is very large. There are no less than dozens of books about Tibet alone, but the price is always more than twenty or thirty shields.</p>
<p>There are less than a thousand overseas Chinese here, most of whom are engaged in commerce. There is a Chinese Association, which serves as a gathering place for overseas Chinese. Every day after noon, they gather in groups at the association to play mahjong. In addition, the association has founded a Chinese elementary school with 40 students. The person in charge of education is Mr. Ba Zhou, who was sent by Mr. Tan Yunshan from the China College. The school expenses are covered by the association by taking a cut from the gamblers, which is laughable.</p>
<p>Return to Kalimpong</p>
<p>On October 1st, I returned to Kalimpong, because Darjeeling and Kalimpong are only separated by a mountain. There is also a convenient road that is thirty miles away. The car fare is forty rupees one way. By the afternoon, there were no fellow passengers, so I took a small car alone for thirty-five yuan. At that time, I was afraid that the police in Kalimpong would recognize me, so I changed into casual clothes, cut my long hair, put on a hard hat, and put on a pair of glasses on my face. I thought I had changed my appearance, but unexpectedly, when the car left the city and was on the way, I was saluted by a British soldier. So it was even worse!</p>
<p>On this day, the clouds were light and the wind was clear. The high peak of the Himalayas, Kado Kjang, appeared completely from morning to night. It was even more obvious than what I saw in Kalimpong. According to the overseas Chinese, it takes ten days to go up and down from here. British officials must visit once every summer, but they cannot reach the peak. Every time they go halfway up the mountain, they are injured by ice. The severe cold on the top of the mountain can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Bamboo forests crisscross along the way, and the trees are mixed. Occasionally, I see bamboo fences and thatched cottages, and the Sikkimese natives who live there. The scenery is picturesque. Suddenly, the clouds obscure the road, and suddenly, the wind is clear and the air is refreshing. Looking at the snow-capped mountains from a distance, they become farther and farther. Until you reach the foot of the mountain, you can no longer see the appearance of the snow-capped mountains. After going down the mountain, you pass through a large town, cross Dada, and merge into the main road. It only took three hours to reach Kalimpong.</p>
<p>Galloping towards Tibet</p>
<p>After returning to Kalimpong, I followed Mr. Ao Gan's instructions and stayed in seclusion. In the evening, I followed Principal Shen to Mr. Ao Gan's residence via a detour through the back mountain to discuss the entry into Tibet. It was said that a person had been hired, but he did not speak Chinese. However, he was very witty and could guarantee that there would be no problems on the way. But his asking price was very high. A few months ago, he sent a compatriot to Lhasa, including horses, for only two hundred shields. Now, he is asking for five hundred rupees to go forward. Therefore, it was canceled.</p>
<p>Mr. Ao then said that if there was no other way, he would send his servant. He was from the An Chong Ba tribe in Xikang and was very loyal, but very stupid. He could also serve as an interpreter and would only need to be paid one and a half shields a day. Since there was no other way, it was decided that his servant would accompany him to Tibet. At this point, in order to understand the recent situation in Tibet, I asked Mr. Ao, and he was willing to tell me everything. The Tibetan clothes needed were also made to order. Only the horses could not be hired for a while, because it was the time when India was busy celebrating the New Year. Therefore, after waiting for three days, three horses were hired. One horse carried luggage, and two horses were ridden, but they could only reach Padri. The total price was more than fifty yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of food on the way, all rice and noodles had to be carried with you, and you needed to bring your own pots and stoves. Principal Shen was also a liaison officer of the Tibetan Affairs Office of the Tibetan Affairs Committee, so he helped me a lot. Since everything had been resolved, on the afternoon of the 4th, the hired follower brought an Indian barber to shave my head. I had the wish to shave my head. Because the six roots were not clean, it was difficult to reach the other shore. So I shaved my head in advance. The barber's knife was fast and his hands were quick. In an instant, I had become a bald head.</p>
<p>The hair was gone, but the wine and meat were still used. Because the Tibetan Lamas did not avoid meat, I was bothered too much by the love of the Li family, who gave me two meals and three snacks a day. So I formally said goodbye on the evening of the 5th and went to Mr. Ao Gan's place to say goodbye. That night, I changed clothes, walked several miles, walked out of the city, and then rode to Tibet the next morning. (End)</p>
<h3>Spain Occupies Tangier: Britain Does Not Recognize: Rumor Spreads that It Will Invade the Port</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Havas) - According to semi-official sources in London, the British Consul-General in Tangier has been instructed to notify the Spanish authorities in the area that Britain does not intend to recognize any changes made by the Spanish government to the international status of the port of Tangier. It is investigated that the port of Tangier is located at the extreme northwest corner of the Atlantic coast of Africa, with a population of 60,000. In 1911-12, the Mediterranean countries temporarily agreed to change it into an international port, including 140 square miles of inland area outside the port, totaling 225 square miles. On December 18, 1923, a draft was signed. In July 1925, the UK, France and Spain signed an agreement stipulating the permanent neutrality, security and internationalization of Tangier. However, the following year, Spain raised the old matter again, demanding full control and incorporating Tangier into the Spanish Moroccan protectorate. Then, on July 25, 1928, a new agreement was signed, granting Spain police power, and the local government of Tangier was jointly composed of a committee organized by eight consuls and an international legislative assembly organized by 26 councilors. However, after the outbreak of the European War, the Spanish Franco government unilaterally announced its occupation, which is why the British government raised objections. However, according to political observers in this regard, the Spanish government announced that any changes made by the country to the administrative status of Tangier were aimed at enhancing the neutrality of the area, which was the case in the past and is still the case now.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - It is rumored in London that British or Allied forces will invade Tangier. The area is located on the south bank of the Strait of Gibraltar and is very important.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Will Submit a Bill to Increase Indirect Taxes to the Diet: After Approval, Travel Revenue Can Be Announced as Part of Additional Military Expenditures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government is actively proceeding to submit various wartime urgent bills to the Diet. One of the important bills is a tax increase bill, which aims to thoroughly curb consumption by increasing liquor taxes and other indirect taxes. In addition, in order to promote the expansion of production and the reorganization of industries, it was decided to amend the "Temporary Tax Measures Plan." The outline of the above bill was passed by the cabinet on the 15th and announced on the 16th. After being submitted to the 81st Diet, which will reopen on the 21st, it can be announced and implemented. This increase in indirect taxes and tax revisions is divided into 13 categories, namely liquor tax, liquor brewing association law, soft drink tax, exchange tax, sugar consumption tax, commodity tax, food and entertainment tax, suspension or cancellation of export tax exemption and export subsidies, special behavior tax, temporary profit tax, temporary tax, local tax law, etc. It is expected that after the implementation of this tax increase bill, it will increase revenue by 1.07 billion yuan in the initial year, and then increase revenue by 1.145 billion yuan each year. The Japanese government intends to use all of the initially scheduled revenue as part of the additional budget for temporary military expenditures in the coming year. The purpose of this tax increase is not to increase national treasury revenue, but to take measures that should be taken in the national economy during wartime, so as to suppress national consumption and ensure the balance between civilian material needs and national purchasing power. Therefore, this tax increase does not take direct tax as the principle, but will increase indirect taxes. As for the main targets of the tax increase, they are luxury goods and luxury behaviors. The higher the luxury, the more the tax will be increased. Special consideration will be given to necessities of life and those related to increasing production. The Japanese government has already implemented price increases for various cigarettes that are regarded as luxury goods from the 17th, with an average increase of about one-sixth, which is expected to increase a total of 442 million yuan annually. Regarding liquor and cigarettes, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Kaga, announced on the 16th that the low-price distribution will be considered for workers engaged in agriculture and various important industries, saying that the revenue from the increase in indirect taxes and cigarette prices will definitely be fully used for war expenses. The purpose of the government's adoption of this measure is, on the one hand, to increase financial revenue, and on the other hand, to promote the enhancement of combat power through materials, labor, and funds. After the implementation of this tax increase, the national burden will inevitably increase, but it is still lighter compared with other belligerent countries, which is enough to prove the elasticity of the Japanese economy.</p>
<h3>Berlin Bombed: Bombs Fall in Residential Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - According to today's government bulletin, as a result of the British aircraft bombing of Berlin last night, a total of 31 people were killed and about 150 people were injured. On Saturday night, British aircraft bombed the German capital again after returning. Explosive bombs were dropped in the residential area. A hospital was also affected. The roof of a large German building was blown through, but fortunately no one was injured. The number of deaths and injuries may continue to increase due to the failure of the rescue.

<h3>US Aircraft Border Crossing: Portugal Agitated: Will File Another Serious Protest</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - A squadron of US aircraft flew over Portuguese territory on Friday, causing agitation here. Although the local newspapers did not mention that 11 US aircraft landed at the Lisbon airfield due to lack of fuel, the news spread very quickly. Political circles believe that the government will file another serious protest against the US aircraft's destruction of Portugal's neutrality. The Portuguese military is now discussing the background behind this incident, and believes that the German victory in North Africa has forced the Allied Air Force to take the fastest route to obtain reinforcements. However, the hope that the British and American Air Forces will surpass the German Air Force is very slim. The fact that the young American pilots failed to fly directly from the UK to North Africa proves this. Portuguese newspapers also published news of US aircraft crashing in Spanish territory, which shows that the Iberian countries need to unite for common interests.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from New York today, on Saturday, New York newspapers published news that 11 US aircraft were forced to land in Portuguese territory. Newspapers published comments saying that the aircraft had to be forced to land due to strong winds. However, the comments did not mention that a large number of US aircraft flew over Portuguese territory and were not affected by the wind.</p>

<h3>Huxi "Tongren Village" Completed - Shantytown Residents Have a Place to Live - Buddhist Tongren Association Fully Constructed - Total Cost of Labor and Materials Over 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The area around Jinjia Lane on Huxi, Jessfield Road, is lined with thatched shacks, no less than 300 of them. The residents are all coolies. At around 10:00 PM on October 30th of last year, they were suddenly struck by a fire that destroyed almost everything. The disaster-stricken people were extremely miserable, wailing on the road, and had no way to appeal.</p>
<p>Distributing Congee and Building Houses - Uniquely Undertaking the Arduous Task</p>
<p>The Buddhist Tongren Association was saddened by this and first distributed congee as a temporary relief. At the same time, it sought a fundamental solution, pleaded for the victims of the alley, and raised huge sums of money. On December 1st of last year, it began to build 126 thatched houses to accommodate approximately 1,600 residents of the disaster-stricken shantytowns. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the completion ceremony was held, which was extremely lively. According to Mr. Hu Songnian, the initiator, who spoke to reporters, the houses are built with seven rows on the west side, each with ten rooms, and five rows on the east side, each with eleven rooms, totaling 125 rooms.

The debts will be handled by the Tongren Association. The construction of all the thatched shacks has now been completed, and they have been handed over to the 15th Lianbao of the First Fang of the Baojia in the area, He Guosheng, for inspection and acceptance and allocated to the disaster-stricken shantytown residents. In addition, six thatched shacks were originally planned to be used as a Buddhist hall, but because the Red Swastika Society and the Huxi Relief Society established a winter congee distribution factory and there was no suitable building at the time, the Tongren Association temporarily rented them out for office use, adopting a cooperative principle. There was no tap water equipment for drinking water, and now five artesian wells have been dug to meet the needs of all the shantytowns. The place is named "Tongren Village" to commemorate it. Those who arrived at the scene yesterday included Fan Gunong, Ban Letian, and dozens of others. On the spot, Mr. Li of the Red Swastika Society generously donated 1,000 yuan, hoping that the wealthy in Shanghai would not shirk their responsibility and would be happy to donate to help so that the association's debt of more than 80,000 yuan could be quickly cleared.</p>

<h3>Business Community Readers Act Righteously - Generously Donate Scholarships - Mr. Ma First Filled Out and Sent the Donation Notification Form - Hoping That All Sectors Will Continue to Promote It So That the Work Can Be Completed</h3>
<p>Since the fourth session of the newspaper reader scholarship fund began accepting applications, it has only been three days and more than 3,000 people have already applied. Although it is still necessary to go through the procedures of investigation, screening, and review to meet the purpose of subsidizing poor and outstanding students, given the limited amount of scholarships currently available, it is inevitable that there will be a regret of not being able to provide widespread assistance. Yesterday, this newspaper specifically issued a special issue for the scholarship fund, revealing the eagerness of students waiting for assistance, in order to gather the power of generous donations from all sectors and cultivate an outstanding talent for society, which is to add a bit of vitality to the country.

<h3>Hoping the Central China Railway Company Improves Order at the North Station Entrance　Bai Hong</h3>
<p>Passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines all grimace at the thought of boarding trains at the North Station. However, how difficult it is can only be fully understood by experiencing it firsthand. Earlier this month, I had the chance to go to Beijing for business and finally understood the reasons behind the chaos.</p>
<p>Currently, passengers are not allowed to enter the station directly through the main gate. Whether empty-handed or carrying luggage, they must enter through the wooden shed on the north side. The shed is narrow, and people and luggage are squeezed together. Furthermore, people must stop inside the shed to wait for inspection, resulting in extreme congestion, profuse sweating, and difficulty in moving one's arms. Often, one has to stand for half a day before entering the station, hearing only the cries of women, children, and the elderly. Outside the shed, the lines stretch almost to Baoshan Road. The strong push ahead, while those who maintain order are forever left behind, their anxiety simply unimaginable. At the same time, pickpockets and illegal elements are rampant. Losing belongings near the wooden shed has become commonplace, especially at night when the lighting is dim. Those who prioritize comfort over money can negotiate a price with the "open-air guides," paying twenty or thirty yuan to be smuggled inside. I am sure the people in charge are unaware of all these situations.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the railway authorities will prioritize passengers and consider their needs more. We would like to offer some suggestions for improvement in the hopes that they will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Efforts should be made to increase the number of trains, and each train should have more cars to accommodate passengers.</p>
<p>(2) Several entrances should be set up, separating those with large luggage from those with small, scattered items, and those with no luggage at all. This would reduce congestion.</p>
<p>(3) The main gate should be opened with the consent of the police and constabulary, allowing passengers with no luggage to enter through the main gate. This would disperse the crowds and facilitate traffic flow.</p>

<p>— Ye Minhe</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ji Xin's article on the women's movement, I also have some opinions to discuss. Indeed, the women's liberation movement has not yet become universal. Social interaction between men and women is still not widely open. Women are equally human beings, differing only slightly in physiology. They have hands and agile minds to handle various tasks. The tasks they handle are no less advanced or slower than those of men. They are equally swift and handle things in an orderly manner. Why can't they enjoy the same rights as men?</p>
<p>Furthermore, some people ultimately see women as useless. They believe that women are only fit to be housewives, taking care of children, cooking and preparing meals, but not serving society. Women, no matter what organizations they serve in, easily encounter contempt or gossip, even hearing insulting words that are hard to bear. They are labeled as vases, active toys, or talking advertisements. This makes them forever timid and unable to boldly advance, preventing them from achieving equality.</p>
<p>Who says women are useless? In the Soviet Union, aren't women participating in politics and serving in the military just like men? Many organizations are led by women. This shows that their liberation movement is very effective. Why hasn't China's women's liberation movement made progress? It can be said that half of the reason is that a group of leaders hold selfish prejudices, discriminating against women and believing that women are not fit to be active in society, always placing women in a passive position. This is especially true for women who have given birth, who are even more discriminated against, because it is believed that having children distracts them and makes them less agile and focused. They have never thought of establishing nurseries. With such prejudices, how can the women's liberation movement develop? May I ask, where in the world are there so many knowledgeable women who have never given birth to expect? They are eliminated as soon as they give birth. How can this not discourage working women? For the sake of their careers and future, they often have the idea of never marrying. This is a frustration for women and a major shortcoming in the Chinese women's liberation movement.</p>
<p>Let's talk about another group of women, such as dancers, female guides, and prostitutes. They should also be qualified to participate in the women's liberation movement. Driven by life's pressures and adverse environments, they have gone astray and endure inhumane lives. Although many ignorant women are willing to fall, there are also many women with considerable education who have resorted to such measures due to the pressure of life. They cannot get social sympathy or even comfort. Some even attack them as troublemakers who hinder the future of young people and poisonous snakes that numb young people. Are they willing to fall? No, absolutely not. They also have aspirations and hope to contribute to society, but it can be said that very few in the vast society sympathize with them. Finally, I offer a sincere suggestion to the leaders of society: women are also rich in transcendental ideas. Establish more institutions that help the women's movement and jointly promote a true women's liberation movement.</p>
<h3>The Lunar New Year is Approaching, and the Commercial Market is Changing　Hoarders and Retailers are Eager to Sell Goods　Credit Loans are Difficult and Accounts are Difficult to Settle</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, Chinese businesses in this city have begun their customary preparations. Most wholesalers are sorting out their inventory, while retailers have begun genuine price reductions to clear out old goods. However, other residents and those specifically engaged in the food trade have not forgotten the past practice of rising prices for food and gifts during the New Year holidays. However, they all hope that gift prices can remain the same as before this year.</p>
<p>Price Reduction Situation of Businesses in the Market</p>
<p>During this period approaching the New Year, the first to announce price reductions were leather shoes. However, it is impossible to reduce the price of a pair of leather shoes that was priced at six hundred yuan a week ago to five hundred yuan now. Nevertheless, some outdated or flawed leather shoes have indeed slightly reduced their prices. Therefore, those who do not want to be too particular about decoration often buy leather shoes during this period. In addition, small businesses in this city have recently held their routine winter sales again. Although the number of businesses reducing prices is less than last winter, some of them are shouting about reducing prices this winter. For some items, such as goods hoarded in the past, the prices have been reduced by 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>Although the New Year is Approaching, Debts are Difficult to Manage</p>
<p>According to the survey, New Year's gifts, such as embroidered handkerchiefs, sewing, and similar goods, do have a significant phenomenon of particularly cheap prices, with price reductions of 10% or even close to 20%. At the same time, according to wholesalers, in the past Lunar New Year, all debts could be cleared and all accounts could be clearly settled. However, this is no longer the case. Credit lending is now rare, so only a very small portion of accounts can be cleared. It is also known that due to the approach of the New Year, a large amount of food is needed to spend the New Year, but in reality, the food market only allows them to buy in small quantities gradually. It is difficult to buy a large amount of food at once.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Charity Football Match Yesterday　China United Beat Western United Two to One</h3>
<p>The Winter Relief Charity Football Match between China United and Western United was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3:15 PM. More than ten thousand spectators attended, creating a lively atmosphere. Mayor Chen personally attended the opening ceremony and kicked off the game. Zhuang Youren and Dai Linjing of China United did not play. The center forward position was filled by Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng was adjusted to the right, and his original position was taken by Li Ning. There were no other changes. For Western United, except for center forward Gain, who was mistakenly replaced by Mao W. Pantoson, the rest were as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle to start the game. Western United launched an attack first, with great momentum. In the ninth minute, Pantoson shot powerfully in front of the goal, but fortunately, Liu Xianhan was agile and saved the shot with both hands. China United counterattacked. In the twelfth minute, Xu Wenkui passed the ball to Jia Youliang. Youliang dribbled to the baseline and made a beautiful cross in front of the goal. Zhuo Shijin was waiting in the right spot and headed the ball into the net, opening the scoring. The audience erupted in cheers. By the thirtieth minute, Sun Jinshun launched an attack on the left, shooting low from 20 yards away. The ball shot out like an arrow and rolled into the corner of the net, doubling the enemy's loss. China United led by two to zero. Western United launched an all-out attack. Fu En took two corner kicks, but China United's defense was tight, and they could not achieve anything. Before long, the first half ended, with China United leading by two goals. After changing sides, China United swapped Song Lingsheng, who was injured, with Li Yichen to strengthen the defense. In the seventh minute, Western United's Dipanna lofted a high ball to the center, which fell in front of the goal. Pantoson was a step too late and missed a good opportunity. Four minutes later, Bao Jie took a hard shot from 20 yards away. Fortunately, Li Yichen headed the ball out in front of the goal, averting the danger. After that, Western United's attack remained strong. In the thirtieth minute, Dipanna shot from 20 yards away, and Liu Xianhan could not save it, announcing a goal. The score became two to one. At this time, Youliang left the field due to a foot injury, but soon rejoined the battle. Afterwards, neither side gained anything. When time ran out, China United defeated Western United by two to one. During the break, the charity football was auctioned off. As a result, Pan Sanxing bought it at a high price of 20,000 yuan. Mr. Pan volunteered to donate the charity football he had obtained for resale, and it was then bought by Wang Yongkang for 6,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Domestic Opinion After China's Entry into the War　China's Entry into the War</h3>
<p>— Translated from the January 10 Mainichi Shimbun Editorial</p>
<p>The National Government, which had been waiting for an opportunity since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, finally rose up and solemnly declared war on the United States and Britain at 10 AM on the 9th.</p>
<p>The reasons for the National Government's declaration of war are clearly stated in its declaration announcement, which states that it will "cooperate with friendly Japan to destroy the United States and Britain, which have been tyrannical in East Asia for a hundred years and are the common enemies of the East Asian people, in order to revive China, liberate East Asia, and build a new East Asian order based on morality," and that "after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, based on the spirit of the Japan-China Basic Treaty, it is determined to share weal and woe with Japan," which should be made clear to both Chinese and foreigners. However, due to the National Government's participation in the war, Japan, China, and Thailand have become a unified entity in East Asia, and their cooperation with Germany, Italy, and other countries in Europe has become closer and more active, to the point where they can use their combined power to deal with the United States and Britain. After participating in the war, there will inevitably be great difficulties, and sacrifices must be endured. The National Government is well aware of this and has boldly taken this step. We sincerely express our respect for its courage and determination.</p>
<p>Following the National Government's courageous and vigorous advance, the Japanese government has also made Japan-China relations as close as possible. At the same time, in order for the National Government to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War for the common goal and the construction of the Greater East Asia New Order without regret, immediately after the issuance of the National Government's declaration of war announcement, it held the exchange of seals for the "Japan-China Joint Declaration on Cooperating to Complete the War" and the "Agreement on Returning Concessions and Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights." The former declares that the two countries, in order to complete the common war, will adhere to complete cooperation in military, political, and economic affairs with unshakable determination and belief; the latter clarifies that in accordance with the spirit of this common declaration, based on the principle of respecting China's sovereignty, Japan will return all of its exclusive concessions in various parts of China, recognize China's recovery of the public concessions and the Beijing Legation Area, and at the same time, it is promised to abolish extraterritorial rights, and further involves various matters, all out of goodwill measures, and strongly supports the construction of the new China, and various treaties will also be given new consideration. The two are indeed Japan's deepest friendship to its neighboring country, China, and at the same time, they have epoch-making significance in the history of Japan-China national relations, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, the United States and Britain have verbally promised the Chinese government several times over the years. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to please the Chongqing regime and prevent its secession, they concluded an agreement on this with the regime on October 10 of last year. However, at that time, the extraterritorial rights and concessions that the United States and Britain had promised to return were actually long gone. However, Japan currently has hundreds of thousands of expatriates in various parts of China who enjoy extraterritorial rights, and it retains eight concessions, so the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions by Japan are completely different in meaning and value from the empty promises of the United States and Britain. Japan's actions for China's sovereignty integrity are substantial. The National Government authorities are naturally expressing their satisfaction with these assurances from the Japanese government, and we also believe that this decision, which respects morality and promises and enables China's long-cherished wish to be achieved in one day, is invaluable.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's decision is based on the fundamental spirit of Japan-China cooperation, expecting an epoch-making development in the relations between the two countries. At the same time, it hopes to quickly build a new China based on independence and autonomy, and to exert the political power of the National Government. Due to the Japanese government's measures, the Chongqing regime's anti-Japanese theory has completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The arrow has been shot, and the participation in the war that the National Government and the people under its leadership have been eagerly anticipating for a year has now become a reality. However, after the declaration of war announcement, the National Government has leaped from a peaceful regime to a combat regime, and the people have leaped from a peaceful people to a combat people. We cannot help but rejoice for the East Asian people at the resolute courage of the Chinese government and people to stand on the common front with Japan, and to advance bravely towards the path of destroying the United States and Britain!

<h3>The Chinese Government's Declaration of War on Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>— Translated from the January 10 Asahi Shimbun Editorial</p>
<p>The National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9. On the same day, it signed the "Japan-China Joint Declaration on Cooperating to Complete the War" and the "Agreement on Returning Concessions and Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights" in Nanjing. The Japanese government also issued a statement on the matter at the same time. This is a sign of an epoch-making development in the Greater East Asia War and the relations between Japan and China. We express our full respect for the unity of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Wang. At the same time, we are confident that this will establish a new Japan-China relationship that is adapted to this new situation. Moreover, the implementation of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights is closely related to the construction of the new China, becoming an implementer of China's liberation. These facts should be welcomed by all Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, under the new slogan of sharing weal and woe, has risen up to cooperate with Japan in order to complete the war. However, on the one hand, the Chongqing regime, which has willingly accepted the manipulation of the United States and Britain, has rebelled against East Asia, declared war on Japan, and joined the US-British front. It has repeatedly disrupted China's internal and external affairs, but it has not yet developed a fully prepared confrontational posture. However, now, with the National Government's declaration of war on the United States and Britain and the publication of the Japan-China Joint Declaration, the new wartime situation has been prepared. At the same time, in order to complete the war against the United States and Britain, the military, political, economic, and all other fields will be more closely cooperated. That is, the National Government has actually entered a new relationship of living and dying together with Japan.</p>
<p>After the National Government participates in the war, it will undoubtedly concentrate its efforts on dealing with the Greater East Asia War. However, it is particularly important to establish security in order to control the schemes of the anti-Yu Party from Chongqing as well as Britain and the United States. At the same time, it must fulfill its task as the base of the Great Rear, strive to increase production, and this is also what we expect. As for the increase in production, Japan's new policies will undoubtedly provide great assistance, thereby increasing the welfare of the Chinese people, so that the hearts of the Chinese people will naturally dedicate their loyalty to the National Government. At the same time, understanding Japan's goodwill will inevitably lead to automatic cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and Japan's long-cherished wish to strengthen the political power of the National Government will also be gradually realized.</p>
<p>Now, due to the National Government's participation in the war, Japan's war power in the Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly be strengthened. However, in order to exert a more remarkable effect, we cannot but hope that the National Government will make greater efforts in the future. The National Government, as it stated in its declaration of war announcement, will not only devote its full efforts to cooperating with Japan in the future, but also strengthen cooperation with Manchukuo and Thailand, and will also respond to the Allied powers such as Germany and Italy, so as to contribute to the ultimate goal of building a Greater East Asia and realizing a just new world order.</p>
<p>This autumn, Japan will return all Japanese-administered concessions within the Republic of China, recognize the Republic of China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Area, and abolish extraterritorial rights. This is exactly what we expect. In the history of Japan-China relations, it will mark a new era. The National Government will undoubtedly accept Japan's goodwill with heartfelt gratitude: and all the people of China. will also be able to truly feel its profound significance. This result can finally deprive the Chongqing regime of its basis for resisting Japan.</p>
<p>Due to the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War and Japan's establishment of a new policy towards China, it is believed that China can move towards the realization of the Pan-Asianism, the lifelong ambition of the revered Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen. China's revival, the construction of a new China, will make great strides forward, and at the same time, the resolution of the China Incident will also be able to gain dawn from this. Moreover, it is not only China alone. This will encourage all the ethnic groups in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, who have been under the shackles of the United States and Britain for many years, to know Japan's sincerity towards China, which is also Japan's sincerity towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This will increase the faith of these ethnic groups in Japan, making it easier for Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is something that can be deeply believed without a doubt.

<h3>Returning from the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Ma Jian</p>
<p>The antiquities exhibition was held at the Jinmen Restaurant's ninth-floor auditorium from the 16th to the 19th, daily from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Those who went to see it came in droves, and I also had the honor of attending. Upon returning, I made this record.</p>
<p>The exhibits mainly consisted of ancient artifacts, with only a few dozen paintings and calligraphy pieces, but most of them were rare treasures. The ancient artifacts were divided into four categories: stone tools, pottery, bronze tools, and porcelain, and as I looked at them in order, I could see the traces of historical change. Before the jade stone scepters, there were stone scepters made as early as the Xia Dynasty, and there was one Xia stone scepter on display here. The Shang Dynasty was still an era where bronze and stone were used together, as can be seen from many stone tools from the Shang Dynasty. The stone bird zun was a stone wine vessel, the whole body in the shape of a bird, with very large feet. The bird yi in the Zhou Li's six yi was probably evolved from this. The Shang stone sacrifice was a stone carving of a reclining ox, with a simple posture. At that time, agriculture was probably valued, and carving this image was a sign of reverence for the plowing ox. Among the pottery, there were many li, which were typical of later bronzes, and were priced very cheaply, at around four or five hundred yuan each. By the Tang Dynasty, the simple style was completely lost. The craftsmanship tended to be delicate. There was a large Tang Dynasty three-color blue-glazed sacrifice on display at the exhibition, which was also an ox statue, but it was very different from the Shang stone sacrifice. Among the bronze tools, there was a Shang taotie you, with the lid's nose in the shape of a bird and the two ears in silent faces, still retaining the "totem" style, but the carving was extremely fine, making people reluctant to let go. There were also several Shang dings, with good patterns and colors; the patterns as fine as hair were particularly valuable. Han Dynasty antiquities were dominated by mirrors, engraved with figures, birds, and beasts, but they already emphasized well-dressed civilized people. By the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, the figures often emphasized Buddhist images, which was after contact with Indian culture. The carving became more and more rounded and beautified.</p>
<p>From the Jin Dynasty onwards, up to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were as many as seventy or eighty pieces of porcelain, with extremely exquisite firing and painting.</p>
<p>Among the paintings and calligraphy, there were Luo Se's "Old Man and Child Enjoying Themselves" painting, Yan Wengui's "Fisherman's Joy" painting, Wang Yangming's family letter from Shanghai, Wang Siren's cursive script, Chen Meigong's bamboo and rock painting... etc. I especially loved Yang Shengxian's "Mountain Pavilion and Pavilion" painting, Wu Wen's "Autumn Boudoir Night Thoughts" scroll, and Zuo Liangyu's "Unveiling Posts" album, among four or five pieces.</p>
<p>Several square seals among the miscellaneous items were also very elegant, priced at more than a thousand or two thousand yuan each, but it was a pity that they were damaged, which was somewhat of a flaw.</p>
<h3>Second Place in Essay Contest: My Plans for This Year</h3>
<p>— Liu Guanye</p>
<p>Tonight, I lean alone against the window, using the light from the roadside lamp to gaze at the desolate fields beyond the wall. The withered willow branches and silent stone tablets seem long forgotten. In this cold and gloomy night, seeing them only makes me feel more lonely and melancholic. But I can rely on this solitude to slowly chew over the past and imagine the future...!</p>
<p>If it weren't for the noise from the nearby entertainment venue suddenly entering my eardrums, I would almost forget that this is a prosperous city, especially tonight, which is a "New Year's Eve" worth celebrating! Alas! I have wasted this night that everyone loves by indulging in aimless thoughts!</p>
<p>The clock hand has passed twelve o'clock. I suddenly realize that the New Year's Eve of 1942 has passed, and now we are entering the New Year's Day of 1943. In the past year, what is worth my recalling? So I cannot help but think of using this quiet New Year's morning to prepare some "My Plans for This Year"!</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot be as naive as children, simply planning to say: "I will study hard," "I will be filial to my parents and respect my elders,"... or paste the two big characters "Daily Renewal" in front of my desk. But I cannot plan like adults, planning how to engage in their careers, although I have gradually stepped into adulthood. Because I have not yet left the era of studying.</p>
<p>When my thoughts were in chaos, the books on my desk helped me a lot. I suddenly thought of "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin" that I had read. Franklin had planned thirteen kinds of courage and perseverance regarding moral perfection:</p>
<p>1. Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</p>
<p>2. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.</p>
<p>3. Order: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</p>
<p>4. Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.</p>
<p>5. Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.</p>
<p>6. Industry: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</p>
<p>7. Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</p>
<p>8. Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</p>
<p>9. Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</p>
<p>10. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes, or habitation.</p>
<p>11. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</p>
<p>12. Chastity.</p>
<p>13. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</p>
<p>He planned to complete these conditions within a year. Of course, I dare not compare myself to him and say that I will complete those conditions within a year, and my environment is also different from his. However, I can firmly say: "I want to try my best to emulate him!"</p>
<p>In this year's plan, I want to pay more attention to "Resolution, Frugality, Diligence, and Sincerity." And "Diligence" is the most important, because in our reading era, we should not waste what our parents provide, so we should be "Frugal." And when we start learning to work, we should also have the power of "Resolution" so that we can work smoothly without difficulty. "Sincerity" is the most fundamental lesson that one understands from childhood. Children often hear their parents and elders issue the injunction "Do not deceive people" from an early age. But if we are not "Diligent," how can we be frugal? We will inevitably spend money to command others to do the work that we can do but are too lazy to do, is this not a waste? Also, because of laziness, we gradually lose our decisiveness, and when others inquire, we will unconsciously use false words to prevaricate, and thus we violate the ordinance of sincerity!</p>
<p>Therefore, Franklin's father, when teaching his children, often quoted a proverb from Solomon: "A man diligent in his business shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men." Although we live in this progressive era and do not believe in these religious superstitions, we can at least see some truth in this sentence. And Franklin himself also believed that labor is the way to obtain wealth and fame.

<h3>Record of Loyal Prince Li Xiucheng (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>It has always been easier to appease good citizens than to pacify rebellious people. Xiucheng not only excelled at appeasing good citizens but also knew how to pacify rebellious people. When Xiucheng first captured Suzhou, the rebellious people of neighboring counties, under the pretext of resisting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, wantonly plundered. Some subordinates wanted Xiucheng to severely suppress them, but Xiucheng refused to listen. He issued a notice inviting them to surrender, but to no avail. Therefore, he went to the countryside to explain to them in person, but the rebellious people surrounded him several times, even pointing spears at Xiucheng's neck. Xiucheng calmly said, "I am Loyal Prince so-and-so. Today, I risk my life to appease you. Those who are willing to surrender, please discard your weapons. I will let you kill me." This scene is even more remarkable than Guo Ziyi's single ride to see the Uighurs. Xiucheng actually considered it calmly, which is truly touching. No wonder the rebellious people all discarded their weapons and surrendered. Within ten days, Yuanhe, Wuxian, Changzhou, Songjiang, Taicang, and other counties were all pacified one after another. Moving people with virtue and implementing policies with gentleness, Xiucheng embodied the essence of Confucianism and the art of Huang-Lao in one person. Even Zeng Guofan would probably have to bow his head in admiration.</p>
<p>Xiucheng was very strict with the soldiers under his command, forbidding them from disturbing the people, but at the same time, he shared weal and woe with them, being closely related. Several times he distributed the goods and silver rewarded to him by Hong Xiuquan to the soldiers, without taking a single cent for himself. Because Xiucheng's discipline was too strict and his official position was too high, he was not liked before and later was restrained by slanderers, resulting in accumulated military merits, and few of his subordinates received rewards from the imperial court. They inevitably had some resentment. Xiucheng often tearfully exhorted them, encouraging them to exert their efforts for the royal family. His subordinates were moved by his loyalty and were willing to die for Xiucheng. Therefore, in the Battle of Suzhou, all the armies were defeated, but Xiucheng's army alone survived. When Nanjing was besieged, Hong Rengan and others, fearing Xiucheng's success, closed the gates under the pretext of epidemic prevention and refused to admit reinforcements. The armies all clamored and were unwilling to fight, but Xiucheng's troops, regardless of day or night, vigorously attacked the enemy camp. Being able to gain such desperate support from his subordinates was definitely not accidental. Therefore, after Nanjing fell, more than 100,000 soldiers would rather die than surrender to the Qing army. Liang Qichao put it well: "More than 100,000 people in Jinling City, none of whom surrendered, compared with the five hundred guests of Tian Heng, their aspirations were the same, their deeds were the same, and their courage was a hundred times greater. This is something that has never happened in the history of warfare."</p>
<p>Xiucheng came from a peasant family. Due to poverty, he lost his opportunity to study at an early age and had little education. However, he was exceptionally intelligent and had a photographic memory. When he first joined the army, he almost suffered capital punishment for secretly reading classics and history. But he did not give up his desire to learn because of this. After becoming prominent, he still studied diligently in his spare time from managing the army. When the Taiping Army first rebelled, because they hated the Qing government, especially the imperial examination system, which was a tool for autocratic emperors to bind the people's minds and corrupt scholars, they opposed it even more. Therefore, they also forbade the reading of general classics, history, philosophy, and literature. But after they established their capital in Nanjing, in order to win over people's hearts and recruit talents, they instead opened the imperial examination and imitated the Manchu Qing. In fact, most of the generals who started the Taiping Rebellion were proficient in writing. Hong Xiuquan himself was an unsuccessful scholar. The King of Yan, who came from a Xiaolian family, was a famous all-rounder in both literature and martial arts. His beautiful sentences were widely circulated. Wei Changhui, Yang Xiuqing, and others had all read classics and history thoroughly and were not uneducated people. Only Xiucheng had less schooling, but because he worked hard, he later became an all-rounder in both literature and martial arts. (Remuneration for Poverty Relief Fund)</p>
<h3>Spring and Autumn Annals of the Drama World</h3>
<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>The Central China "Lu Manzi" was ordered to suspend performances for three days. From the 16th, it resumed its performances with renewed vigor. The actors were in high spirits. The play will be performed until the end of the lunar year. The new play in the new year is the costume drama "Xi Shi." Empress Dowager Cixi Jiang Hong also participated in the performance.</p>
<p>The Tiangong Theater will be leased by Zhang Guoyu to restage dramas. The cast is part of the students of the New China Drama Troupe, led by Hu Mojun, for a period of one week.</p>
<p>Following "Song of Neon Clothes," the Mei Hua Grand Theater may stage "The Unofficial Biography of a Female Performer," written by Chuan Wei and directed by Shu Shi, with Murong Wan'er taking the lead. At the same time, from the first day to the fifth day of the lunar new year, the entire elite force of the Guangming Theater will work together to perform the four-act tragedy "Spring Flower," written by Niu Lang and directed by Lu Chen.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Teacher of All Time</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>He began to tell little jokes - jokes that students liked - that would cause laughter and at the same time leave some impression memory methods and variations in their hearts. There was one joke that never lost its charm, although it was just one of many other similar jokes. A certain Roman law allowed nobles (Patrician) to marry commoners (Plebeian). Whenever his Roman history class came to this point, he would always add, "So you can know that if Ms. Plebs wants Mr. Patrician to marry her, and he says he can't, she probably wants to answer like this: "Oh, no, you can, you liar!"" Roaring laughter.</p>
<p>Kathie (nickname for Katherine - translator) also expanded his observations and insights, giving him a view far beyond the roofs and spires of Brookfield, so that he could see his country, simply something vast and profound, Brookfield for this thing is just one of many converging streams. She had a more intelligent mind than him, and even when he disagreed with her views, he could not confuse her views; for example, in politics, no matter her all radical socialist remarks, he was always a conservative. However, even if he did not accept, he absorbed: her youthful idealism had an effect on his mature character, thus producing a very soft and intelligent mixture.</p>
<p>Sometimes she also tried her best to persuade him. For example, Brookfield was setting up a church in East London, and students and their parents were generously donating money to it, but there was rarely any personal contact. Gardlin suggested that the church could send a football team to Brookfield to compete with one of the school's football teams. This opinion was so revolutionary that everyone except Gardlin thought that the opinion would be severely rejected and would not be established. Bringing a group of street urchins to mingle and have fun with the young masters of the upper class, at first glance, it was simply better to make a mess of things than not to have this at all.

<h3>Thoughts After Receiving a Scholarship</h3>
<p>— Wu Gensheng, Sumin Middle School</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times is moving forward non-stop. Calculating the time, it has been the fourth semester since I received the scholarship. In the past three semesters, I have been able to listen quietly in the classroom like others, and gain valuable knowledge, without suffering the pain of dropping out of school. This is of course due to the members of the scholarship committee of Shen Bao and the general enthusiastic people in society.</p>
<p>Recalling that since I was cultivated in the Disaster Children's Education Center until I graduated from elementary school, I was often anxious and sad for my future. I know that knowledge is the foundation of a career. Without profound knowledge, there is no bright future. Therefore, I feel that continuing my studies was the first problem to be solved at that time. So I bravely appealed to Shen Bao without any clue, and I was able to get the sympathy and sponsorship of enthusiastic people in society, and thanks to the efforts of the host committee, I was able to get the opportunity to study with financial assistance.</p>
<p>In addition to sincerely thanking, I should also understand the difficulty of studying, and work harder and strive hard! In order to repay the enthusiastic people in society. In the future, I hope to rescue more drop-out companions. I warmly hope that the scholarship will be promoted and make greater contributions!</p>
